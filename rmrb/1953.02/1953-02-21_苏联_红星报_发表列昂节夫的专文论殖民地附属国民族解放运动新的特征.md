Xinhua News Agency, February 20th, Moscow: According to TASS, "Red Star" published an article by Leontiev on the national liberation movements of people in colonies and dependent countries.

Leontiev wrote: The upsurge of the national liberation movements in colonies and dependent countries shows that the great ideals of Marxism-Leninism, which show all mankind how to liberate themselves from oppression, poverty, and injustice, have captured the hearts of hundreds of millions of men and women in colonial countries. Now, in their struggles, the people of colonial and semi-colonial countries can utilize not only the rich experience of the Soviet Union but also the experience of the People's Republic of China and other People's Democratic countries. The existence of these countries curbs the growth of reactionary forces, thus facilitating the struggle of the oppressed people. At the same time, the greatly increased awareness of the people of the United States, Britain, and France, and the increasingly fierce contradictions between the imperialist robbers, have also created favorable conditions for the liberation struggle of the colonial people.

Leontiev emphasized: Under the new historical conditions, the national liberation movement has presented various new characteristics. First, the momentum of the national liberation movement is unprecedentedly huge. This movement has spread in various forms to all colonies and dependent countries. Korea, Vietnam, Malaya, the Philippines, and other Asian countries are waging armed struggles against foreign enslavers. Resistance and mass demonstrations by the people of Tunisia, Morocco, Algeria, Kenya, the Union of South Africa, and Nigeria show that the struggle of the African people is becoming increasingly strong. The people of Latin American countries oppose the signing of military agreements with the United States and oppose the rule of the American imperialists.

The second characteristic of the national liberation movement is the increasing leadership of the proletariat and the Communist and Workers' Parties. In Korea, Vietnam, Malaya, the Philippines, and many other countries, the proletariat, under the leadership of the Communist and Workers' Parties, has become the leader of the national liberation struggle in each country. Many countries have formed or are organizing national united fronts, in which the proletariat plays a leading role.

Another important feature of the national liberation movement at this stage is that the people of Southeast Asian countries have adopted the highest form of national liberation movement—armed struggle. The People's Armies of Korea, Vietnam, and Malaya and other countries have developed into a powerful force, inflicting fatal blows on the elite troops of the colonizers.

Leontiev pointed out that the American imperialists, panicked by the national liberation movement, are doing everything possible to extinguish the powerful movement of the people for freedom and independence. They are using traitors to organize puppet governments, attempting to organize the reactionary leaders of the right-wing socialist parties, and establishing military bases in various colonies in order to turn these countries into bridgeheads for them to launch wars and dominate the world.

In this situation, the national liberation movement in colonies and dependent countries is combined with the struggle of the people of the world against imperialism.

    苏联“红星报”发表列昂节夫的专文论殖民地附属国民族解放运动新的特征
    【新华社二十日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：“红星报”发表列昂节夫论殖民地和附属国人民民族解放运动的一篇文章。
    列昂节夫写道：殖民地和附属国民族解放运动的高涨表明：昭示全人类如何从压迫、穷困和非正义的状态下获得解放的马克思—列宁主义的伟大理想，已经掌握了殖民地国家中亿万男女的心灵。现在，殖民地和半殖民地国家的人民在进行斗争时，不仅能利用苏联丰富的经验，而且还能利用中华人民共和国及其他人民民主国家的经验。这些国家的存在遏止了反动势力的成长，因而便利了被压迫人民的斗争。同时，美、英、法各国人民觉悟的大大提高和帝国主义强盗之间矛盾的日益剧烈，也为殖民地人民的解放斗争创造了有利的条件。
    列昂节夫强调说：在新的历史条件下，民族解放运动呈现了种种新的特征。首先是民族解放运动的声势空前浩大。这一运动已以不同的形式扩展到一切殖民地和附属国家。朝鲜、越南、马来亚、菲律宾和亚洲其他国家正在对外国奴役者进行武装斗争。突尼斯、摩洛哥、阿尔及利亚、怯尼亚、南非联邦和尼日利亚人民的反抗和群众示威运动表明非洲人民的斗争越来越强大。拉丁美洲各国人民反对和美国签订军事协定，反对美帝国主义者的统治。
    民族解放运动的第二个特征是无产阶级和共产党与工人党的领导地位日益提高。朝鲜、越南、马来亚、菲律宾和其他许多国家的无产阶级在共产党和工人党的领导下，已成为各该国民族解放斗争的领导者。许多国家都已经组成或正在组织民族统一阵线，无产阶级在这个阵线中起着领导作用。
    现阶段民族解放运动另一个重要的特征是：东南亚各国人民已经采取了民族解放运动的最高形式——武装斗争。朝鲜、越南和马来亚等国的人民军已经发展为一支强大的力量，使殖民者的精锐军队遭受致命打击。
    列昂节夫指出：被民族解放运动吓得张皇失措的美帝国主义者不惜一切代价来扑灭人民争取自由与独立的强大运动。他们利用卖国贼组织傀儡政府，妄想把右翼社会党的反动领袖们组织起来，并且在各殖民地建立军事基地，以便把这些国家变成他们发动战争、称霸世界的桥头堡。
    在这种情况下，殖民地与附属国的民族解放运动和全世界人民反对帝国主义的斗争结合起来了。
