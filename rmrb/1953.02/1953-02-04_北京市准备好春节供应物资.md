    Beijing is Preparing Spring Festival Supplies
    In order to allow the people of the capital to happily celebrate the Spring Festival, Beijing's state-owned trading companies, cooperatives, and private businesses have prepared Spring Festival supplies.
    Beijing's state-owned trading companies and the Municipal Cooperative General Agency have attached great importance to this year's Spring Festival supply work. All units made Spring Festival material supply plans in early January, and carried out allocation and procurement separately. So far, the supply of materials has been fully prepared. The Beijing Branch of the China National Cereals Corporation has prepared sufficient flour and Xiaozhan rice, which are in greatest demand by the city's people. The reserve of pigs is even greater, and more than 30,000 pigs will be supplied to the market in the ten days before and after the Spring Festival. The supply of beef and mutton will be more than double that of this year's New Year's Day. Northeast Guoguang apples and oranges from Guangdong, Zhejiang and other places have also been shipped in large quantities, and the quantity will be more than double that of last year's Spring Festival. The shelves of the department stores of the Beijing Branch of the China National Department Store are filled with daily necessities.
    In the preparation of Spring Festival supplies, private businesses have also played an active role. In the past half month, private businesses have purchased a large number of Spring Festival goods. For example, the three industries of private cattle, sheep, camel, pork, and pig, horse, and mule slaughtering have purchased more than 1,300 cattle, 3,000 sheep, and 6,800 pigs. The fishery industry purchased more than 200,000 catties of carp, crucian carp, etc. In addition, the Spring Festival goods prepared by the native products and food, pastries and sweets, silk fabrics, and department stores industries are also about twice as much as last year's Spring Festival.
