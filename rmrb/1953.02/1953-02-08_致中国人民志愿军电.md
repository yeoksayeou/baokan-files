    To Commander Peng Dehuai and all the beloved comrades of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army:
    The Fourth Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference is being held in the capital, Beijing, to discuss and decide on the major tasks of our country in 1953. On behalf of the conference, I would like to extend our cordial greetings and victorious salutations to you.
    The three major tasks of 1953 are: to continue strengthening the resistance against U.S. aggression and aid to Korea, to begin the Five-Year National Construction Plan, and to convene the National People's Congress. The reason why our country can now begin large-scale national construction and implement the political construction of the People's Congress system is inseparable from your great victories on the battlefield of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea. You and the Korean People's Army fought side by side and won continuous and brilliant victories, curbing the aggressive arrogance of American imperialism, defending the security of the motherland, enhancing the conditions for the motherland to engage in economic and political construction, and encouraging the fighting will of peace-loving people all over the world. American imperialism has suffered painful blows, but the American warmongers are still unwilling to admit defeat. They are still insisting on the absurd proposition of forcibly detaining our captured personnel, constantly creating provocative incidents that undermine the armistice negotiation agreement, and attempting to expand the war of aggression against Korea. Therefore, our struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea needs to be further strengthened until the U.S. government is willing to end the Korean War fairly and reasonably with us. The people of the motherland are remembering you with gratitude and will continue to strengthen their support for you. The great construction of the motherland has begun, and your heroic battles are defending the construction of the motherland. The people of the motherland guarantee to support you with all their strength in construction work to achieve complete victory in resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea. Comrades, fight hard! With Chairman Mao leading us, we will surely win the resistance against U.S. aggression and aid to Korea, and the national construction will surely succeed.
    Let us shout:
    Strive for the complete victory of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea!
    Strive for the smooth success of national construction!
    Long live the People's Republic of China!
    Long live the great Chairman Mao!
       The Fourth Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference
        February 7, 1953

    致中国人民志愿军电彭德怀司令员并转亲爱的中国人民志愿军全体同志们：
    中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第四次会议，正在首都北京集会，讨论并决定一九五三年我们国家的重大任务。谨以大会的名义，向你们致亲切的慰问，并致胜利的敬礼。
    一九五三年的三大任务是：继续加强抗美援朝，开始五年国家建设计划和召开全国人民代表大会。我们国家现在所以能够开始大规模的国家建设和实施人民代表大会制的政治建设，是与你们在抗美援朝战场上的伟大胜利分不开的。你们和朝鲜人民军并肩作战，获得了连续不断的辉煌胜利，遏止了美帝国主义的侵略凶焰，保卫了祖国的安全，给祖国增强了从事经济建设和政治建设的条件，同时鼓舞了全世界爱好和平人民的斗争意志。美帝国主义已经遭受了惨痛的打击，但美国战争贩子们还不甘心承认失败，他们还在坚持强迫扣留我被俘人员的荒谬主张，还在不断制造破坏停战谈判协议的挑衅事件，并且还在企图扩大侵朝战争，所以我们的抗美援朝的斗争还需要继续加强，直至美国政府愿意和我们公平合理地结束朝鲜战争时为止。祖国全体人民都在以感激的心情怀念你们，定将继续加强对你们的支持。祖国的大建设开始了，你们的英勇战斗在保卫着祖国的建设，祖国全体人民保证以全力进行建设工作来支持你们，以取得抗美援朝的完全胜利。同志们，努力战斗吧！有毛主席领导我们，抗美援朝一定胜利，国家建设一定成功。
    让我们高呼：
    为抗美援朝的完全胜利而奋斗！
    为国家建设的顺利成功而奋斗！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    伟大的毛主席万岁！
       中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第四次会议
        一九五三年二月七日
