    Xinhua News Agency, February 20th: TASS Moscow, February 18th—"Pravda" published a New York dispatch by Kraminov, commenting on the rising anti-war sentiment in the United States.

    Kraminov wrote: The Michigan state government arrested Robert Walsh in mid-January and imprisoned him. The reason for the arrest was that he did not report to the conscription station. When he was arrested by the police, he firmly refused to swear allegiance to the United States and its armed forces. Walsh preferred to go to jail rather than join the army. This case vividly demonstrates the growing dissatisfaction of the American people with the unjust and futile Korean War.

    Kraminov continued: The people who voted for peace in Korea during the presidential campaign have now begun to realize that they have been viciously deceived. That is why the call for an end to the Korean War is growing louder. The American Labor Party in New York State has launched a campaign to collect signatures for a petition against new war plans. Farmers in the eastern states held a meeting in Trenton, New Jersey, demanding an immediate end to the Korean War and the realization of peace in Korea. American youth are carrying out silent and stubborn resistance against being drafted into the military or civil administration. Cases of desertion are increasing.

    Kraminov said: From all the facts, it can be seen that the people's disappointment is growing and gradually turning into strong dissatisfaction with the US government's continued and strengthened policy of aggression.

    All-Ceylon Peace Committee Issues Statement
    The People of Ceylon Will Absolutely Not Fight Against China

    Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, February 20th: Colombo News: The All-Ceylon Peace Committee issued a statement in Colombo on the 12th, opposing the US government's preparation to expand the Korean War.

    The statement said: The people of Ceylon must clearly express that they want to live in peace, and they do not want to let this country be involved in war and serve the American war-mongers. The people of Ceylon oppose the US government's preparation to expand the Korean War.

    Referring to the recent visit to Ceylon by the US Sixth Fleet commanded by US Navy Vice Admiral Wright, the statement emphasized: The US government hopes to obtain as many bases as possible in the Indian Ocean, but the people of Ceylon do not allow any foreign country to retain or use bases on its land.

    The statement concluded: Ceylon must never be allowed to be used as a pawn in the war against China. We want to say to Eisenhower: Asians will not fight Asians. Asia wants peace.

    People in Various Parts of Brazil Hold Meetings
    Resolutely Oppose Sending Troops to Korea

    Xinhua News Agency, February 20th: TASS Montevideo News: The Brazilian people are resolutely opposed to the conspiracy of the Brazilian ruling group to prepare to send troops to participate in the war of aggression against Korea. The activities of the Brazilian reactionaries to instigate veterans of the Brazilian Expeditionary Force who fought in Italy during World War II to participate in the war have failed.

    Meetings have been held in various parts of Brazil to protest against sending troops to Korea under the guise of "volunteering" to fight for the United States. At the reserve soldiers' oath-taking conference in Presidente Prudente City, a reserve soldier said that if the government wanted to send troops to Korea, he would rather be a deserter than fight abroad. His words won applause from the audience.

    The São Paulo State Branch of the Brazilian Veterans Association issued a statement firmly opposing the Veterans Association and any involvement in sending Brazilian troops to Korea.

    The protest movement includes people from all walks of life in Brazil. Armando Simira, a member of the São Paulo Municipal Council, Anberdo Davares Ferreira, a veteran of the Expeditionary Force, Congressman Roberto Morena, and many others protested against the attempt to send troops to participate in the aggression against Korea under the guise of so-called "volunteering."

    The Brazilian "People's Daily" commented: The wave of popular anger against sending troops to Korea is rising. No person with a sense of justice would be willing to go to the Korean battlefield to die for the benefit of American war-mongers.

    反对美国扩大战争的运动高涨
    美国人民反战情绪日益增长
    东部农民要求停止侵朝战争
    【新华社二十日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科十八日讯：“真理报”刊载了克拉米诺夫的一篇纽约通讯，评论美国国内日益高涨的反战情绪。
    克拉米诺夫写道：密执安州政府于上月中旬逮捕了罗伯特·华尔希，把他关在狱里。逮捕的原因是因为他没有向征兵站报到。当他被警察抓去的时候，他坚决拒绝宣誓效忠美国和他的武装部队。华尔希宁愿进监狱也不肯去当兵。这件案子生动地证明了美国人民对非正义的、无益的朝鲜战争日益高涨的不满情绪。
    克拉米诺夫继续写道：在总统竞选运动中为了朝鲜的和平而投票的人民现在已开始认识到他们受了恶毒的欺骗。这就是为什么要求结束朝鲜战争的呼声日高的原因。美国劳工党在纽约州发动了一个为反对新战争计划的抗议书征集签名的运动。东部各州的农民曾在新泽西州特伦顿地方举行会议，要求立即停止朝鲜的战争和实现朝鲜的和平。美国青年正进行沉默而顽强的抵抗，反对军事或民政当局征召他们入伍。开小差的情形越来越多。
    克拉米诺夫说：从一切事实中可以看出，人民失望的情绪正在日益增长，逐渐变为对美国政府继续和加强侵略政策的强烈不满。全锡兰和平委员会发表声明
    锡兰人民绝不对中国作战
    【新华社新德里二十日电】科伦坡消息：全锡兰和平委员会十二日在科伦坡发表声明，反对美国政府准备扩大朝鲜战争。
    声明说：锡兰人民必须明白表示，他们希望过和平生活，他们不愿让这个国家卷入战争，替美国战争贩子效劳。锡兰人民反对美国政府准备扩大朝鲜战争。
    声明在谈到最近访问锡兰的美国海军中将赖特指挥的美国第六舰队时强调指出：美国政府希望在印度洋得到尽可能多的基地，但是锡兰人民不许任何外国在它的土地上保有或使用基地。
    声明最后说：决不能让锡兰充当对中国作战的小卒。我们要对艾森豪威尔说：亚洲人是不会打亚洲人的。亚洲是希望和平的。巴西各地人民纷纷举行集会
    坚决反对派遣军队去朝鲜
    【新华社二十日讯】据塔斯社蒙得维的亚消息：巴西人民坚决反对巴西统治集团准备派遣军队参加侵略朝鲜战争的阴谋。巴西反动派鼓动曾在二次大战期间在意大利作战的巴西远征军退伍军人参战的活动已告失败。
    巴西各地纷纷举行集会，抗议在“自愿”的伪装下派军队去朝鲜替美国作战。在普鲁登特总统城的后备兵宣誓大会上，一个后备兵发言说，假如政府要派军队到朝鲜去的话，他宁愿作一个逃兵，也不愿到国外去作战。他的话博得全场的掌声。
    巴西退伍军人协会圣保罗州分会发表声明，坚决反对退伍军人协会和任何派遣巴西军队赴朝鲜的事情发生关系。
    抗议运动包括巴西各界人民。圣保罗市政委员会委员亚曼多·西米拉、远征军退伍军人安伯多·达瓦列斯·费雷拉、议员罗伯托·摩伦纳以及其他许多人都表示抗议在所谓“自愿”的伪装下派遣军队参加侵略朝鲜的企图。
    巴西“人民报”在评论中说：人民反对派遣军队到朝鲜去的怒潮正在高涨。有正义感的人绝对不会愿意为美国战争贩子的利益到朝鲜战场上去送死。澳维多利亚省和平组织
    要求立即停止侵朝战争
    【新华社二十日讯】塔斯社悉尼十八日讯：据墨尔本“世纪报”报道，澳大利亚维多利亚省和平理事会已号召所有爱好和平的人们要求立即在朝鲜停火。
