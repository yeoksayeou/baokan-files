Some Experiences in Learning from Soviet Experts in Factory Basic Construction Design
Li Zhi

For the past year and a half, we have been working with Soviet experts on factory basic construction design and have learned a great deal. Here, I will only write down my personal key experiences for the reference of comrades engaged in design work.

I. Sufficient and Correct Original Data Must Be Collected

The design of any factory must be based on documents such as the planning task book, the technical construction data of the products, the geology, topography, hydrology, and meteorology of the factory area, as well as nearby water sources, power sources, material sources, and transportation. If it is a reconstructed factory, the drawings and data of the old factory's underground pipeline layout, power system, existing equipment list, and old factory building structure are also required. If these data are not collected and analyzed before and during the design process, and their correctness is not determined, the design work cannot proceed normally, the design time will be prolonged, and rework and waste will result. In the end, it will be necessary to go back and re-investigate and re-design. After surveying the factory site and initially deciding on the site with Soviet experts, the first thing we did was to arrange for the collection of detailed design materials. Some reconstructed factories maintain their original production while designing and constructing the reconstruction project. In the past, some factory leaders only paid attention to production, believing that basic construction work was just about building houses, which could be handled casually by the design and basic construction departments themselves. They did not attach importance to the supply of original data, which resulted in delays in construction and ultimately affected the completion of production tasks. For example, a factory was eager to build a boiler room and entrusted the project to a company in Shanghai for design and construction. Because the data was not well collected and analyzed before the design, although the boiler room was built by the end of 1951 and the boiler and all necessary equipment were installed, it still cannot be used today. We studied the project at the factory and found that the boiler room foundation had no waterproof layer, and its location was the lowest point in the entire factory. The factory was also built in an area with high rainfall, and the entire factory had no rainwater pipe network or sewers, so the boiler room was constantly immersed in water. The tunnels under the boiler and the flue leading to the chimney were filled with water, and the mud joints of the refractory bricks near the foundation had been eroded by water. If this erosion continues, the ten-meter chimney is in danger of collapsing. This lesson must be learned. We believe that all design, construction, and production departments must be alerted to the work of investigating, collecting, and supplying original design data. Larger engineering units should be equipped with a certain amount of surveying and exploration resources. Local meteorological stations and geological research institutions should also pay attention to accumulating and supplying information in various aspects, and helping to analyze this information.

II. Save National Funds and Speed Up the Design Process

Taking only the design of the factory power distribution system as an example, adopting the Soviet design method can increase the utilization rate of transformers to about 80% (the utilization rate of transformers in the old Japanese-style power distribution system only reached 20% or 30%), while saving transformers and a large amount of copper wire.

In the machine workshops of some factories, Soviet experts guided us to use iron busbars instead of copper busbars. When this method was first adopted, some workers thought they had never seen iron busbars and dared not use them; some people thought that iron busbars had high losses and were not necessarily cost-effective, and might rust. Later, after actual trial use, we have widely promoted this advanced Soviet experience in the various factories we design. Workers have reported that iron busbars work the same way and are easy to install; when the factory expands or machine tools are moved, disassembly is simple and does not cause damage. Iron is about eleven times cheaper than copper. This not only saves national investment, but also saves non-ferrous metals that our country still feels lacking. In many other designs, Soviet experts have also provided many substitutes. For example, in the past, lead plates needed to be installed around X-ray inspection rooms to provide insulation. Now we use a mixture of barite and cement lime to replace it. This method has been successfully tested in the construction and production departments, saving a large amount of expensive and scarce lead plates.

Regarding the issue of how to use safety factors in various designs, the Soviet Union also has many advanced experiences. Soviet experts often divide the design situation very meticulously, and the safety factors used are also different for different design situations, unlike the scope of use of safety factors in British and American capitalist countries, which are defined very vaguely, resulting in waste of materials when adopted.

In the future, the task of basic construction will be very large, and the design department must deliver construction drawings in a timely manner without reducing the quality of the design. That is to say, the design department should do the design work well and quickly under the condition that the personnel are not yet sufficient. Adopting the Soviet design method can help us complete this arduous task.

First of all, the Soviet design method widely uses standard designs, which can avoid a lot of repetitive work. Not only dormitories, schools, public buildings, etc. can adopt standard designs, but also factory roof steel frames, substations, lifting equipment, and even foundation engineering for equipment installation can adopt standard designs. Some people think that adopting standard designs cannot give full play to personal "creativity," which is a wrong bourgeois design ideology. If we regard the country's large-scale construction as an opportunity to express personal "masterpieces," and can slowly "research" it alone, it would be a great mistake. Of course, when making standard designs or selecting standard designs, we should be particularly cautious, because if the standard designs that will be widely adopted have errors, it will cause great losses to the country.

Secondly, the Soviet design method widely uses charts and curves, avoiding many difficult calculations. For example, a factory, under the leadership of several engineers, designed and installed a heavy-duty bridge crane based on British and American books, which took a year. With the same number of designers, we designed more than 30 different types, different lifting capacities, and different spans of cranes within a year according to the various chart data provided by Soviet experts, and also did the installation design of these cranes. Some designers blindly pursue theoretical calculations, thinking that using charts for design work is too simple and not "tasteful." This is also a concrete manifestation of being educated by British and American bourgeois for a long time, simply worshiping abstract theory, and not seeking practical application. We should often summarize and collect these empirical data to improve design efficiency.

When learning from the Soviet design experience, we should also learn the class viewpoint in Soviet design work. In the factory design of capitalist countries, capitalists not only do not consider the working conditions of workers, but also try their best to deepen the exploitation of the working class. In the designs we carry out under the guidance of Soviet experts, we pay great attention to the working conditions of workers (including technical safety, worker health, and ease of operation). Soviet experts often told our designers: "Economy is very important. We should strictly and conscientiously consider the issue of economy in equipment selection, labor quota determination, and labor organization. But we must never be demanding in saving on workers' working conditions. On the contrary, we must maintain and improve workers' working conditions." In the designs guided by Soviet experts, most machine tools have electrical grounding equipment to prevent workers from electric shock. In workshops with chemical odors, gasoline washing odors, or other bad pungent gases, in addition to installing local exhaust equipment on individual equipment that generates gas, there are also full-room ventilation devices. In some workshops, such as forging workshops, foundry workshops, and electroplating workshops, there are bathrooms, locker rooms, etc.; larger workshops also have health stations.

Experience has proven that learning from the Soviet Union's advanced science and technology, design methods, and design ideas is a fundamental link in successfully completing the task of basic construction design.

III. Strengthen the Contact Between Departments

Modernized factory design is an extremely complex task, and design issues must be considered politically and economically. Technically, the design also has complex internal connections. If these internal connections are not clarified, rework, waste, and delays in construction will often occur.

The technical design and construction drawings of the factory usually start with process design and end with the design of various specialized parts such as civil engineering, water supply and drainage, heating and ventilation, power lighting, gas supply, transportation and installation. These designs are not carried out one after another continuously, but are usually carried out alternately and in coordination with each other. Therefore, it is extremely important to strengthen the connection between various designs, otherwise contradictions between designs will often occur. In the past, some factories had problems with water channels colliding with underground ventilation ducts or steam pipelines, drainage pipelines, and gas supply pipelines, which made the construction department "idle" waiting for design modifications. To strengthen the connection between various designs, it is necessary to strengthen the planning unit within the design organization, and educate designers to establish a design viewpoint of starting from the overall situation and taking care of each other, and eliminate the idea of designing only according to personal interests. A contact system should be established between various designs. In addition to frequent mutual research and discussion, the drawings of some specialized parts must be signed and agreed by the designers of other relevant specialized parts before they can be printed and sent to the construction department.

The production, construction, and design of many factories are carried out simultaneously, which is a phenomenon that cannot be completely avoided under the current conditions. This makes it easy for production to wait for construction and construction to wait for design. In the past, some factories solved this problem by building or installing temporary structures, or by arbitrarily designing and then carrying out construction. After the formal design drawings were completed, they re-did a new set. This approach increases the proportion of temporary engineering investment and wastes a lot of national funds. According to our experience, factories that do not follow the correct and step-by-step overall factory design and construction, but arbitrarily carry out construction on their own, will be delayed in their development speed. Because the design organization considers the problem more comprehensively and thoughtfully, they not only consider the current production problem, but also consider the problem in the further development of the factory. If the production department or the construction department, only based on current needs or local needs, without the consent of the design department, does its own thing, it will cause serious adverse consequences. We believe that to correctly solve this problem, the connection between the design organization and the production and construction departments should be strengthened. The design and construction units should jointly formulate the engineering design and construction plan according to the production needs and the factory's development prospects, and organize the inspection of the plan to ensure its implementation. However, when arranging the plan schedule, we must be good at distinguishing between the important and the urgent, and we cannot reverse the order or advance on all fronts at the same time. The installation projects most needed for production, the more complex and seasonal projects, and general projects should be treated separately. This year's basic construction task is very heavy, and our design work must fight against time. If the design progress plan is done well, we can win time and make full use of time, otherwise we will inevitably fall into a passive position.

Strengthening the connection between design and construction can not only ensure correct and rapid construction, but also continuously check the quality of the design from construction. A good design should be the most economical and practical, and the most convenient for construction. Soviet experts said: "The thing that makes designers feel sad is that personal elaborate design causes waste to the country and difficulties to construction." Soviet design experts attach great importance to investigating the actual construction situation. After a project is completed, they often go to investigate and study, using the problems encountered in construction as a reference for improving the design.

IV. Learn from the Working Spirit of Soviet Experts

Our designers should also learn from the serious and responsible working spirit of Soviet experts. Soviet experts often tell us: "Design drawings command the battle of basic construction like military orders. It is extremely important for designers to carry out design seriously and responsibly, pay attention to adopting advanced quotas and standards, and cherish the wealth of the motherland."

Careless and sloppy work styles are the great enemies of correct design. Some designers often think that reviewing designs and mathematical calculations are "administrative" work, and this kind of thinking will bring serious harm to basic construction. When one of our comrades was calculating the deflection of the crane beam, he mistakenly misplaced the decimal point of a number by one digit, and without review, he thought that the deflection of the crane beam was within the safe range, and signed the drawing and sent it to the factory for construction. Later, when calculating a similar crane beam in another factory, he accidentally discovered this error and immediately notified the factory to stop the installation by long-distance telephone. Fortunately, the factory had not yet started construction, so the tragedy of the collapse of a crane weighing several tons was avoided. In contrast, Soviet experts always check the design line by line before signing their agreement. Even after our several reviews of the drawings, Soviet experts often found some errors. Soviet experts often told our designers: "There is a saying in the Soviet Union: 'Measure seven times, cut once.' It means that when a tailor makes clothes, he must repeatedly measure before cutting with scissors. For designers, we must do: 'Check seven times, draw once.'"

Designers should be meticulous in their calculations when designing, and always think about national funds. The waste caused by errors in design is often more amazing than the waste caused by a specific construction error. In the minds of designers, what conflicts with the idea of "careful calculation" are the ideas of simply pursuing beauty, worshiping appearance, and being afraid of trouble and unwilling to repeatedly consider calculations. A designer who disliked the trouble of calculation, when calculating the cross-sectional stability of a certain steel column, easily erased several digits after some decimal points, and as a result, it was calculated that the 27-shaped I-beam was too small, and changed to a 30-shaped I-beam. After the review by Soviet experts, the 27-shaped I-beam was completely applicable, thus saving the country hundreds of millions of yuan. Soviet experts are not afraid of any trouble in order to save funds, and always repeatedly study and calculate. They said: "Perhaps this is a boring and complicated calculation, but it is not a trouble to calculate accurately in order to save people's money. You must know that it is most worthwhile to consider more on the design drawing." Soviet experts often teach us to make several plans for an important design, and then select the most economical and reasonable one.

It is necessary to educate designers to have a broad political vision, and not only be able to correctly consider and decide on problems in the technical aspect, but also be able to correctly consider and decide on problems in the political significance of the design. This is an extremely important thing. Soviet experts have always educated our designers in this way.

    向苏联专家学习工厂基本建设设计的几点体会
    立之
    一年半以来，我们跟苏联专家一起进行工厂基本建设的设计工作，学到了很多东西。这里只将我个人的几点主要体会写出来，供做设计工作的同志们参考。
    一、必须收集足够的正确的原始资料
    任何一个工厂的设计，都必须有计划任务书、产品的施工技术资料、厂区的地质、地形、水文、气象及附近的水源、电源、材料来源、交通运输等资料作根据。如果是改建工厂，还需要旧厂的地下管道线路、动力系统、旧有的设备清单、旧厂房建筑结构等图纸资料。如果不在设计之前和设计过程中收集、分析这些资料，并判定它们的正确性，设计工作就不能正常进行，设计时间也会拖长，结果会造成返工、浪费现象，最后还是要回过头来重新调查研究，改行设计。我们跟苏联专家在勘测厂址并初步决定了厂址以后，首先作的一项工作，就是布置收集详细设计材料。一些改建性质的工厂，则是一面维持原状生产，一面进行改建工程的设计与施工。过去有些工厂的领导干部只注意生产，认为基本建设工作只是盖盖房子，可以由设计部门和基本建设部门自己随便去搞，不重视供给原始资料，结果拖延了工期，最后还是影响了生产任务的完成。例如某工厂急于修造锅炉房，把这件工程交给上海某公司去设计和施工。因为在设计前没有很好地收集和分析资料，锅炉房虽然在一九五一年年底修盖好了，并安装了锅炉及应有的全套设备，但是拖到今天，仍然不能使用。我们到该厂把这件工程研究了一次，发现这个锅炉房基础没有防水层，它的位置却在全厂最低的地方，这个工厂又建在雨量较多的地区，全厂没有雨水管网及下水道，所以锅炉房始终浸在水里，锅炉底下的坑道和通向烟囱的烟道充满了水，靠近基础地方的耐火砖的泥缝已经被水冲蚀。如果再继续任其浸蚀下去，十余公尺的烟囱就有倒塌的危险。这种教训是必须记取的。我们认为，必须唤起所有设计、施工及生产部门都来注意调查、收集及供给原始设计资料的工作。规模较大的工程单位，应配备一定的勘探测量力量。各地气象台、地质研究机关也应该注意积累和供应各方面的资料，并帮助分析这些资料。
    二、大量节省国家资金，加速设计进程
    仅就工厂配电系统的设计来说，采用苏联的设计方法，可以使变压器的使用率提高到百分之八十左右（旧有的日本式配电系统，变压器使用率只达到百分之二十或三十），同时可以节省变压器，可以节省大量铜线。
    在某些工厂的机器车间里，苏联专家指导我们用铁制汇流条代替铜线汇流条。开始采用这一办法时，有些工人认为从来没有看见过铁制汇流条，不敢使用；有些人认为铁制汇流条损耗大，不一定省钱，可能生锈。后来经过实际试用。现在我们设计的各个工厂都在广泛推行这一苏联先进经验。工人们反映说，铁制汇流条用起来完全一样，而且安装容易；在工厂扩充或机床移动时，拆卸简便，又不会损坏。铁比铜贱十一倍左右。这样不但节省了国家投资，而且节省了我国尚感缺乏的有色金属。在其他很多设计中，苏联专家也提供了不少代用品。例如过去在X光检验室的周围，需要安上铅板起隔绝作用，现在我们采用重晶石及水泥石灰的混合物来代替它。这一办法在施工及生产部门已试验成功，大量节省了价格昂贵而且缺乏的铅板。
    在各种设计中如何使用安全系数问题，苏联也有很多先进的经验。苏联专家经常将设计情况分得很细致，不同的设计情况采用的安全系数也不同，不像英美资本主义国家的安全系数的使用范围规定得很笼统，以致采用时浪费材料。
    今后基本建设的任务很大，设计部门必须及时交出施工图纸，同时又不能降低设计质量。也就是说，设计部门应该在人员还不充足的条件下，将设计工作做得又好又快。采用苏联设计方法，可以帮助我们完成这一艰巨的任务。
    首先，苏联设计方法中大量采用标准设计，可以避免很多重复的工作。不仅宿舍、学校、公用建筑等可以采用标准设计，工厂的厂房屋顶钢架、变电站、起重设备，以至设备安装的基础工程等也都可以采用标准设计。有些人认为采用标准设计不能发挥个人的“创造性”，这是错误的资产阶级设计思想。我们如果将国家的大规模建设看成是表现个人“杰作”的机会，可以一个人去慢慢“研究”，那就是莫大的错误。当然，在做标准设计或挑选标准设计时，应该特别慎重，因为将被大量采用的标准设计如果有错误，会给国家造成很大的损失。
    其次，苏联设计方法中大量采用图表曲线，避免了很多繁难的计算。例如某厂在好几个工程师领导下，依据英美书籍，设计和安装一个重型桥形起重机，前后费时一年。我们以同样数量的设计人员，按照苏联专家提供的各种图表数据，在一年内就设计了三十多个各种不同类型、不同起重量和不同跨度的起重机，并且做了这些起重机的安装设计。有些设计人员盲目追求理论计算，认为用查图表进行设计工作太简单，不够“味”，这也是长期受了英美资产阶级教育，单纯崇拜抽象理论，不求实际运用的具体表现。我们应该经常总结汇集这些经验数据，以提高设计效率。
    在学习苏联设计经验时，还应学习苏联设计工作中的阶级观点。在资本主义国家的工厂设计中，资本家不但不考虑工人的工作条件，而且想尽办法加深对工人阶级的剥削。我们在苏联专家指导下进行的设计中，都十分注意工人的工作条件（包括技术安全、工人健康、操作便利等）。苏联专家经常告诫我们的设计人员说：“节约是很重要的，我们在设备选择上，劳动定额的确定上和劳动组织上，应该严格认真地考虑节约问题。但是我们绝对不能在工人劳动条件上苛求节约。相反地，我们要维护和改善工人的劳动条件。”苏联专家所指导的设计中，大部分机床都有电的接地设备，以免工人触电。有化学药品气味、汽油洗涤气味或有其他恶劣刺鼻气体的车间里，除了在产生气体的单个设备上安装局部抽风设备，还有全室的通风装置。在有些车间，如锻造车间、铸造车间、电镀车间里都有浴室、更衣室等；规模较大的车间里还有卫生站。
    经验证明：学习苏联先进的科学技术、设计方法和设计思想，是我们胜利完成基本建设设计任务的基本环节。
    三、加强各部门的联系
    近代化的工厂设计，是一件极为复杂的工作，必须从政治上和经济上来考虑设计问题。就设计的技术上来说，也有复杂的内在联系，如果不搞清楚这些内在联系，就常常会造成返工浪费、延误工程的现象。
    工厂的技术设计和施工图，通常是从工艺设计开始，而以土木建筑、上下水道、暖气通风、动力照明、气体供应、运输安装等各个专门部分的设计为终结。这些设计并不是一个接着一个连续进行的，而通常是交错进行和互相配合进行的。因此，加强各种设计之间的联系极为重要，否则就常会造成设计之间相互矛盾的现象。过去有些厂就发生过水道与地下通风道或者蒸汽管道、排水管道、气体供应管道相碰的事情，这样就使施工部门“窝工”等待修改设计。要加强各种设计之间的联系，必须加强设计机构内部的计划单位，并教育设计人员树立从全局出发相互照顾的设计观点，扫除那种仅按个人兴趣设计的思想。各种设计之间要建立联系制度，除经常相互研究讨论以外，有的专门部分的图纸还必须经过有关的各个其他专门部分设计者签字同意，才能晒制发给施工部门。
    很多工厂的生产、施工及设计是同时进行的，这是在目前条件下还不能完全避免的现象。这样就容易发生生产等待施工、施工等待设计的情况。过去有些工厂解决这个问题的方法，是作临时性的建筑或安装，或者自己随便设计一下就进行施工，在正式设计图纸完成以后，又再重新搞一套。这种做法使得临时性工程投资比重加大，浪费国家不少资金。根据我们的经验，凡是不按正确的有步骤的全厂整体设计施工，而任意自行施工的工厂，在发展速度上都反而要推迟。因为设计机构所考虑的问题更为全面、周到，他们不只是考虑当前的生产问题，还要考虑到工厂进一步发展当中的问题，如果生产部门或施工部门只就当前需要或者局部需要，未经设计部门同意自行搞一套，就会造成严重的不良后果。我们认为，要正确地解决这个问题，应该加强设计机构和生产及施工部门的联系，设计和施工单位应该共同按生产需要和工厂发展前途订出工程设计及施工计划，并组织对计划的检查，以求贯彻。但在排列计划进度时，要善于分清轻重缓急，不能先后倒置或齐头并进。应该将生产上最需要的安装工程、较为复杂的和有季节性的工程与一般工程分别对待。今年的基本建设任务十分重大，我们的设计工作要跟时间作斗争。如果设计进度计划做得好，就能争取时间，充分利用时间，否则就必然陷于被动。
    加强设计与施工之间的联系，不仅可以保证正确地、迅速地施工，而且可以不断地从施工中检查设计的质量。良好的设计应该是最经济合用，并且最便于施工的。苏联专家说：“对于设计者感到痛心的事情，是个人的精心设计给国家造成浪费，给施工带来困难。”苏联设计专家很重视考察实际施工的情况，在一个工程完毕之后，常常要去调查研究，以施工中所碰到的问题作为改进设计的参考。
    四、学习苏联专家的工作精神
    我们设计人员，还应学习苏联专家严肃负责的工作精神。苏联专家经常告诉我们：“设计图纸有如军事命令一样指挥着基本建设的战斗。严肃负责地进行设计、注意采用先进的定额标准、珍惜祖国财富，这是设计人员极为重要的品质。”
    粗枝大叶、马虎草率的作风是进行正确设计的大敌。有些设计人员常常认为审查设计和数学计算是“事务性”工作，这种思想将给基本建设带来严重危害。我们有一个同志在计算吊车梁的垂度时，误将一个数字的小数点错了一位，未经审查就认为该吊车梁的垂度在安全范围以内，便把图纸签了字发到工厂施工。后来在计算另一工厂相类似的吊车梁时，偶然发现了这一错误，立即用长途电话通知工厂停止安装。幸而工厂尚未施工，才没有造成数吨重的吊车倒塌的惨剧。与此相反，苏联专家审查设计时，总是一字一线地校核后才签字同意。经过我们几次校核的图纸，苏联专家还时常找出一些错误来。苏联专家经常告诉我们的设计人员说：“苏联有一句俗语：‘量七次、裁一次。’意思是指裁缝做衣服时，必须反复量比后才下剪刀。对设计人员来说，我们要做到：‘校七次，画一次。’”
    设计人员在进行设计时，要精打细算，时刻为国家资金着想。设计中的错误造成的浪费常常比一项具体施工错误所造成的浪费更为惊人。在设计人员中与“精打细算”思想相抵触的是单纯追求美观、崇尚外表的思想和怕麻烦、不愿反复考虑计算的思想。有一个设计员嫌计算麻烦，在计算某钢柱的剖面稳定性时，将一些小数点后面的数字轻易抹去几位，结果算出用二十七号工字钢太小，改用了三十号工字钢。后经苏联专家审核结果，用二十七号工字钢完全适用，因而为国家节省了数亿元资金。苏联专家为了节省资金是不怕任何麻烦的，总是要反复研究计算。他们说：“也许这是枯燥的繁杂的计算，但是为了节省人民的钱而精确计算，这并不算麻烦。要知道，在设计图上多考虑是最值得的。”苏联专家常常教育我们对一个重要的设计要做出好几个方案，然后挑选其中最为经济、合理的一个。
    教育设计人员要具有远大的政治眼光，不只在技术方面能正确考虑和决定问题，而且，在设计的政治意义上也要能正确考虑和决定问题。这是一件极重要的事情。苏联专家就时刻这样地教育着我们的设计人员。
