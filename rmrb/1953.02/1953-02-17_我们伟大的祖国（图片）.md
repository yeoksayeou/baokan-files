    Our Great Motherland
    While celebrating the Spring Festival this year, the Chinese people deeply recognized that our happy life is inseparable from the heroic struggle of the People's Liberation Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers in defending the motherland. These are the Young Pioneers of Beijing No. 12 Girls' Middle School. They are hanging a lantern of honor for the family of a Chinese People's Volunteer, Old Lady He.
