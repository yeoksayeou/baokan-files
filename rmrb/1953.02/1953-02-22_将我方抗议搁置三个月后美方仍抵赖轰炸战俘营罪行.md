Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, February 21st. The U.S. side bombed our side's POW Camp No. 9 in Soonchun on November 26th of last year, injuring three POWs. Regarding our protest to the U.S. side on this incident, the U.S. negotiating chief representative Harrison did not reply until February 19th of this year, and even said it was "propaganda." From this, it can be seen how much this U.S. chief representative disregards the lives of POWs. Harrison, who used the "indefinite adjournment" method in Panmunjom, thus interrupting the armistice negotiations, put General Nan Ri's protest aside for nearly three months, and now refuses to deal with the incidents of POW camps being repeatedly bombed with an irresponsible attitude.

In his reply, which was delayed until February 19th, Harrison used unfounded words to "reject" General Nan Ri's protest regarding the U.S. bombing of the POW camp, saying that "it has now been confirmed that no aircraft used any weapons near Soonchun at the time in question." In fact, hundreds of POWs on his own side witnessed the bombing with their own eyes. U.S. aircraft first dropped flares over the conspicuously marked POW camp, and then bombed the POW camp time and time again. Of the three people who were injured, two were seriously injured. In Harrison's reply, there was not a single word about how to prevent the recurrence of such indiscriminate bombing of POW camps.

It is believed here that Harrison's barbaric reply, which was delayed for nearly three months, means that the U.S. side intends to continue bombing POW camps in accordance with Washington's plan to expand the war. In the past, the U.S. side requested the address materials of the POW camps, and then bombed these POW camps. In the past year alone, U.S. aircraft bombed or strafed POW camps in North Korea nine times, killing or injuring more than 200 POWs on their own side.

### 将我方抗议搁置三个月后美方仍抵赖轰炸战俘营罪行

    将我方抗议搁置三个月后美方仍抵赖轰炸战俘营罪行
    【新华社开城二十一日电】美方曾经在去年十一月二十六日轰炸我方顺川第九号战俘营，炸伤战俘三名。对于我方就这一事件向美方提出的抗议，美方谈判首席代表哈利逊直到今年二月十九日才答复，还说这是一种“宣传”。从这里又可以看出这位美方首席代表是如何忽视战俘的生命。在板门店采取“无限期休会”手段因而中断了停战谈判的哈利逊，把南日将军的抗议搁置了差不多三个月以后，现在却以毫不负责的态度，一再拒绝处理战俘营屡次遭受轰炸的事件。
    哈利逊在他拖延到二月十九日才交来的复文中，用毫无根据的话来“拒绝”南日将军就美方轰炸战俘营事件所提出的抗议，他说什么“现已肯定，在所说的时间内，并无任何飞机在顺川附近使用任何武器”。而事实上，他自己方面的战俘就有好几百人都亲眼看到这次轰炸。美方飞机先在有显著标志的战俘营上空投下了照明弹，然后一次又一次地对战俘营投弹。被炸伤的三个人里面，有两个人伤势很重。在哈利逊的答复中，没有一个字提到如何防止这种不分皂白地轰炸战俘营事件的重演。
    此间认为，在搁置了近三个月才交来的哈利逊的横蛮的答复，意味着美方打算依照华盛顿扩大战争的计划，继续轰炸战俘营。过去美方索取了战俘营的地址材料，跟着就来轰炸这些战俘营。单在去年，美方飞机就有九次轰炸或扫射在北朝鲜的战俘营，使他们自己方面的战俘死伤二百多人。
