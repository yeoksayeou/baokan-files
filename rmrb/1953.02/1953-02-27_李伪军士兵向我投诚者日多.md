(Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, February 25th) Due to the US's active planning and clamoring for new military adventures, lower-ranking officers and soldiers of the Li Seung-man pseudo-army, feeling anxious and uneasy, are increasingly crossing the strict surveillance network set up by the US-Li gangs on the front lines to come over and surrender to the Korean-Chinese People's Army. According to a Korean Central News Agency reporter on the eastern front: during the period from February 2nd to February 13th, the number of Li pseudo-army officers and soldiers who surrendered to our army increased to more than eight times that of January. On the morning of February 13th, more than ten officers and soldiers from the Li pseudo-army's 6th, 12th, and 15th divisions came to surrender. On the same day, Jin Duguan (transliteration), the pseudo-army lieutenant and deputy adjutant of the 3rd company of the 1st battalion of the 9th regiment of the 11th division of the Li pseudo-army, and Kim Seung-joon (transliteration), a pseudo-army second lieutenant, and 19 other pseudo-army officers and soldiers surrendered to the Korean People's Army with their weapons.

Yang Rong-soo, a first-class heavy weapons soldier of the 6th company of the 2nd battalion of the 51st regiment of the 12th division of the Li pseudo-army, who surrendered on February 13th, spoke about the fear of the Li pseudo-army soldiers regarding new military adventures by the US, saying: "The soldiers all know that if 'Eisenhower's new offensive' is launched, then none of them may return home alive. Now, the soldiers are trembling in terror. Many of my friends are doing excessive fortification work under the violence of the officers and sergeants in the face of the 'new offensive'. Because food is very scarce, they are not getting the supplies needed to sustain the work and are starving. Therefore, even though deserters are executed after being caught, the number of deserters is increasing every day."

The Li pseudo-army soldiers who surrendered all said that the US soldiers' feelings of war-weariness and fear of death are no less than those of the Li pseudo-army. Recently, the number of deserters—so-called "absent without leave"—in the US military has also been greatly increasing.

    李伪军士兵向我投诚者日多
    【新华社平壤二十五日电】由于美国积极策划和叫嚣要进行新军事冒险而惶惶不安的李承晚伪军下级军官和士兵，越来越多地越过美李匪帮设在前线的严密监视网，向朝中人民军队投诚。据朝鲜中央通讯社东线记者报道：在二月二日到二月十三日的期间，向我军投诚的李伪军官兵人数，增加到一月份的八倍多。二月十三日早晨，有李伪军六师、十二师和十五师的官兵十多名前来投诚。同一天，又有李伪军十一师九联队一大队三中队伪军中队副官金斗官（译音）和伪军少尉金升俊（译音）等十九名伪军官兵携带武器向朝鲜人民军投诚。
    二月十三日投诚的李伪军十二师五十一联队二大队六中队重武器一等兵杨容洙谈到李伪军士兵害怕美国进行新军事冒险的情形说：“士兵们都知道：如果‘艾森豪威尔的新攻势’发动的话，那么他们便没有一个人可能活着回家。现在，士兵们正在恐怖中颤抖着。我的许多朋友在面临‘新攻势’的时候，在将校门的暴力下干着过重的阵地作业。由于食粮十分困难，他们得不到能够维持作业的供给而陷于饥饿之中。因此，尽管逃兵被捕后要被枪决，但逃兵人数每天都有增加。”
    投诚的李伪军士兵都说，美军士兵厌战怕死的情绪也不下于李伪军。最近，美军中的逃兵——所谓
    “擅离职守者”的人数，也在大大增加。
