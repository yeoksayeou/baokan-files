Xinhua News Agency, January 31st: After conducting three days of conspiratorial activities in Korea, U.S. Army Chief of Staff Collins returned to Tokyo on the 29th and immediately held secret military meetings with Taylor, the newly appointed commander of the U.S. Eighth Army, who arrived in Tokyo on the same day from the United States, and Clark, the commander-in-chief of the U.S. Far East Command.

According to American news agencies, Collins met with South Korean puppet president Syngman Rhee in Korea, received a report from Van Fleet, who had been removed from his post as commander of the Eighth Army, and, accompanied by Van Fleet, inspected the Rhee puppet army units on the front lines and the Rhee puppet army's training centers. Collins' series of activities were clearly aimed at implementing Eisenhower's plan of "using Asians to fight Asians," urging the acceleration of arming the Rhee puppet army so that it could replace the American troops on the front lines, allowing the American troops to be withdrawn to engage in new military adventures. International News Service reported from Seoul on the 27th that "Collins came to Korea to implement President Eisenhower's plan: to make more vigorous efforts in the Korean War," and the Syngman Rhee puppet army "will play a major role in this plan."

During the secret meetings in Tokyo, according to International News Service, Collins and others will decide on the specific steps to continue and expand the war of aggression against Korea. The Associated Press also reported that Tokyo speculated: "There will soon be new developments in the war - either the Allied forces will launch a large-scale offensive, or the Allied forces will put greater direct pressure on Communist mainland China." After the meeting, Collins will also go to northern Hokkaido, Japan, for "inspection" before returning to the United States. According to International News Service, Collins will "conduct final consultations" with Eisenhower on expanding the war of aggression against Korea after returning to the country.

    柯林斯与泰勒、克拉克等在东京举行秘密军事会议
    【新华社三十一日讯】美国陆军参谋长柯林斯在朝鲜进行了三天阴谋活动以后，于二十九日回到东京，并立即和在同一天由美国到达东京的新任美军第八军军长泰勒以及美军远东总司令克拉克举行秘密军事会议。
    据美国通讯社报道，柯林斯在朝鲜会见了南朝鲜傀儡总统李承晚，听取了已被撤销第八军军长职务的范佛里特的汇报，并在范佛里特陪同下巡视了战线上的李伪军部队和李伪军的训练中心。柯林斯进行这一系列活动，显然是为了执行艾森豪威尔的“用亚洲人打亚洲人”的计划，督促加速武装李伪军，以便用李伪军来代替前线上的美国军队，使美国军队得以抽出来从事新的军事冒险。国际新闻社汉城二十七日电就报道说，“柯林斯来朝鲜是执行艾森豪威尔总统的计划：在朝鲜战争中进行更有力的努力”，而李承晚伪军“将在这种计划中起主要作用”。
    在东京举行的秘密会议中，据国际新闻社透露，柯林斯等将决定继续和扩大侵略朝鲜战争的具体步骤。美联社也报道说，东京方面猜测：“战争很快就要有新的发展——不是联军要进行大规模的攻势，就是联军要对共产党的中国大陆加以更大的直接压力。”柯林斯在会后并将前往日本的北海道北部去“巡视”，然后返回美国。据国际新闻社透露，柯林斯返国后将和艾森豪威尔就扩大侵朝战争“进行最后的商谈”。
