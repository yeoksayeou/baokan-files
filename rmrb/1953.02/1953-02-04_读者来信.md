Summary of Reader Opinions on the Case of Anhua County Cadre Cao Chunsheng Beating a Farmer to Death
——Reader Letters Summary

After the People's Daily published a report on January 18th regarding the incident of "Cao Chunsheng, a cadre in Anhua County, Hunan Province, exhibiting severe local tyrant behavior, illegally and violating discipline by beating farmers Wang Hongkai and Wang Zhenjia to death, and the local People's Government has sentenced the principal offender Cao Chunsheng to death," readers have sent letters to this newspaper expressing their opinions. As of the end of January, this newspaper has received a total of fifty-three letters on this matter.

The opinions of the readers can be summarized into three points: First, they support the local People's Government's sentencing of the principal offender Cao Chunsheng to death and suggest holding a mass meeting in the local area to carry out the execution; second, they agree with the opinions put forward in the "Editor's Note" of this newspaper that the relevant personnel involved in the case who violated laws and neglected their duties, such as Wang Zhitang, Wang Zhuxiang, Wang Zhongai, Wang Youkun, and Zhang Hesong, must be given the deserved criminal or administrative punishments, and the party member cadres among them must also be subject to party discipline; third, the CPC Anhua County Committee and the Anhua County People's Government involved in the case must conduct profound self-criticism. They also hope that the handling results of the above opinions will be publicly published in this newspaper.

In addition, reader Li Changyou wrote, "I have examined myself in connection with this incident. As a public security officer, I should protect the interests of the people, but I have also engaged in acts that infringe upon human rights. From now on, I will resolutely overcome my past bad style and be a loyal servant of the people." Reader Guan Xin wrote, "Such incidents are not isolated. The work style of some district and township cadres in Pingxiang County, Jiangxi, is very poor. They act in a tyrannical and arbitrary manner in the countryside, making decisions unilaterally and not implementing government policies. Important decrees from higher-level governments are deliberately withheld by district and township cadres and not passed down. The masses do not dare to express their opinions when they see district and township cadres. Some district and township cadres handle matters based solely on personal grudges." Readers Yu Zexiu and three others wrote, "We suggest that all regions learn from the lessons of this incident and conduct detailed inspections to see if there are similar incidents." Reader Zhang Zengfu wrote, "In order to prevent and correct feudal and barbaric behaviors like Cao Chunsheng's, it is necessary to conduct a massive ideological education among the vast number of rural cadres, and even launch a mass movement." Reader Hou Yuchu wrote, "This is a serious incident following the 'Ji Kaifu incident,' 'Zhang Shunyou incident,' 'Dou Duanxiao incident,' etc. Its exposure and handling demonstrate the Communist Party's determination to fight against bad people and bad deeds to the end. I also deeply realize the correctness and greatness of the Communist Party."

Suggestions for Promoting the Experience of Lushan County in Implementing the Marriage Law

Editor: After reading the article "How Lushan County, Henan Province, Implemented the Marriage Law" published in the People's Daily on January 6th, I believe that Lushan County has achieved significant results in implementing the Marriage Law, and their experience is very important and worth promoting throughout the country. I suggest that the Marriage Law Implementation Committees at all levels and all relevant departments in various regions universally study and promote the experience of Lushan County. In particular, the leaders of Party and Youth League organizations and people's schools in various regions should immediately begin educating Party members, Youth League members, and students of people's schools about the Marriage Law, combined with the example of Lushan County. I also suggest that Party propagandists and theater troupes in rural areas should now focus on preparing to promote the Marriage Law, such as studying relevant policies and collecting propaganda materials, so as to widely carry out propaganda activities during the Spring Festival and in the large-scale Marriage Law implementation campaign in March. Village theater troupes should start collecting typical true stories related to the implementation of the Marriage Law in the local area as soon as possible and compile them into short plays for performance. Propaganda personnel in various regions should also consider how to conduct propaganda about the Marriage Law in reading groups, mutual aid groups, cooperatives, and other organizations, so as to ensure that the Marriage Law penetrates every corner and the minds of every person.

Shanxi Provincial Department of Industry Should Be Responsible for Correcting the Deceptive Behavior of Coal Mines in Zuoyun County Towards Farmers

Editor: Many farmers in Chengguan District, Fengzhen County, Suiyuan Province, go to the state-owned coal mines in Huangtugou and Heshangzui in Zuoyun County, Shanxi Province, a hundred miles away, to haul coal during the winter slack season. The cadres of this coal mine have a bad work style and deduct weight when weighing coal for farmers, causing great losses to our farmers.

This coal mine's behavior of deceiving farmers is consistent; the amount of coal deducted each time is quite large. Gao Baozi on our street hauled a thousand catties of coal on December 2nd last year, but it only weighed nine hundred and thirty catties when he came back. Huo Fuchou has also gone to haul coal twice recently, each carload of a thousand catties, and each time he was shortchanged by about eighty catties. There are many such examples. Every day, five hundred carts go to the mine to haul coal. If each cart (one thousand catties) is shortchanged by an average of fifty catties, then there will be twenty-five thousand catties per day. Over time, how much will the number be! The farmers have many opinions on this situation. Dan Zhuzi once raised this issue with the weigher, but the reply was: "It's up to you whether you haul coal or not, but you have to follow our rules anyway." We also wanted to ask the local People's Government to solve this problem. We heard that the farmers in Zuoyun County had raised their opinions with the local People's Government several times, but they were never taken seriously. So we didn't have the courage to raise it again.

We believe that the Shanxi Provincial People's Government should inspect this issue and correct this bad behavior of deceiving farmers.
    All Farmers of the Nanzhalizi Farmers Association Group, Second Farmers Association of Chengguan District, Fengzhen County, Suiyuan Province (Written by Fu Baoyuan)

Editor's Note: The bad behavior of the state-owned coal mines in Huangtugou and Heshangzui in Zuoyun County, Shanxi Province, of deducting weight when weighing coal for farmers is a manifestation of capitalist business thinking. It is absolutely not allowed to exist, especially in state-owned enterprises. This bad behavior not only damages the interests of farmers and dampens the enthusiasm of local farmers in running side businesses, but also seriously damages the prestige of the People's Government. It is also inappropriate for the Zuoyun County People's Government not to correct this behavior that damages the interests of the masses and the prestige of the state after hearing repeated reflections from the masses. We suggest that the Shanxi Provincial People's Government's Department of Industry promptly take responsibility for handling this issue and inform us of the results.

    读者对安化县区干部曹春生打死农民事件的意见
    ——读者来信综述
    一月十八日本报刊载了关于“湖南省安化县区干部曹春生恶霸作风严重，竟违法乱纪打死农民王宏开和王振家，当地人民政府已将主犯曹春生判处死刑”事件的报道后，读者纷纷给本报来信表示意见。截至一月底，本报共收到此项来信五十三件。
    读者们的意见，综合起来有三点：一、拥护当地人民政府判处该案主犯曹春生死刑，并建议在当地召开群众大会执行；二、同意本报“编者按”提出的意见，对该案有关的违法失职人员，如王智堂、王柱祥、王忠爱、王又坤、张鹤松等，必须给予应得的刑事处分或行政处分，其中的党员干部，还必须受到党纪的制裁；三、与该案有关的中共湖南省安化县委会、安化县人民政府，必须作深刻检讨。并希望将上述意见的处理结果在本报公开发表。
    另外，读者李长有来信说：“我结合这一事件检查了我自己。我身为公安人员，应该是保护人民利益的，可是我也有过侵犯人权的行为。今后，我坚决克服我过去的恶劣作风，作一个为人民服务的忠实的勤务员”。读者关新来信说：“像这样的事件，并不是个别的。江西萍乡县某些区、乡干部的工作作风，就很不好。他们在乡村中横行霸道，独断独行，不执行政府政策。上级政府的重要法令，到了区、乡后，就被区、乡干部故意扣留起来，不往下传达。群众见了区、乡干部，都不敢提意见。某些区、乡干部处理一件事情，只凭个人恩怨。”读者于泽修等四人来信说：“我们建议各地区应接受这一事件的教训，详细检查，看是否有类似事件。”读者张增富来信说：“为了防止和纠正像曹春生这样的封建性的野蛮行为，在广大的农村干部中，进行一次巨大的思想教育，甚至搞一个群众运动，都是必要的。”读者侯豫楚来信说：“这是继‘纪凯夫事件’、‘张顺有事件’、‘窦端孝事件’等之后的一个严重事件。它的揭发和处理，说明了共产党为反对坏人坏事而斗争到底。我也更深深体会到共产党的正确和伟大。”
    建议推广鲁山县贯彻婚姻法的经验
    编辑同志：我看了人民日报一月六日刊载的“河南省鲁山县是怎样贯彻执行婚姻法的”这篇文章以后，认为鲁山县贯彻执行婚姻法的成绩很显著，他们的经验很重要，值得全国各地推广。我建议各地各级贯彻婚姻法运动委员会和一切有关部门，普遍学习和推广鲁山县的经验。尤其各地的党、团组织和民校的领导人，应马上着手在党员、团员和民校学员中，结合鲁山县的例子，进行关于婚姻法的教育。我还建议，农村中党的宣传员和剧团，现在就抓紧进行宣传婚姻法的准备工作，如学习有关政策，搜集宣传材料等，以便在春节期间和在三月份大规模的贯彻婚姻法的运动中，广泛开展宣传活动。村剧团最好及早开始搜集一些当地有关贯彻婚姻法的典型的真人真事，编成短剧，以备演出。各地宣传人员，还应该考虑如何在读报组、互助组、合作社等组织中进行关于婚姻法的宣传，务使婚姻法深入到每一个角落、每一个人的心目中去。

    山西省工业厅应该负责纠正左云县煤窑欺骗农民的行为
    编辑同志：我们绥远省丰镇县城关区很多农民在冬闲时到一百里外的山西省左云县黄土沟、和尚嘴地方国营煤窑拉炭。这个煤窑的干部作风恶劣，给农民秤炭时克扣分量，使我们农民受到很大损失。
    该窑这种欺骗农民的行为是有一贯性的；每次克扣的炭数量很不小。我们街上的高保子在去年十二月二日拉了一千斤炭，但回来一称只有九百三十斤。霍付丑最近也去拉了两次，每车一千斤，都要短八十斤左右。这样的例子是很多的。到该窑拉炭的每天有五百辆大车，如果每车（一千斤）平均缺秤五十斤，每天就要有两万五千斤。时间长了，数目该有多大呢！农民们对这种情况都很有意见。单柱子为了这事曾向掌秤的人提过意见，但答复是：“拉不拉炭随你，反正得按我们的规矩。”我们也曾想要求当地人民政府解决这个问题。听说左云县的农民曾几次向当地人民政府提过意见，但始终没有得到重视。所以我们也就没有勇气再提了。
    我们认为：山西省人民政府应对这个问题加以检查，纠正这种欺骗农民的恶劣行为。
    绥远省丰镇县城关区第二农民协会南栅
    子里农会小组全体农民（傅保援代笔）
    编者按：山西左云县黄土沟、和尚嘴的地方国营煤窑给农民秤炭时克扣分量的恶劣行为，是资本主义经营思想的一种表现。特别在国家企业中是决不允许存在的。这种恶劣行为，不但损害了农民的利益，打击了当地农民经营副业的积极性，并且严重地损害了人民政府的威信。左云县人民政府在听到群众多次反映以后，对这种损害群众利益和国家威信的行为不加纠正，这也是不应该的。我们建议山西省人民政府工业厅迅速负责处理这个问题，并将结果告诉我们。
