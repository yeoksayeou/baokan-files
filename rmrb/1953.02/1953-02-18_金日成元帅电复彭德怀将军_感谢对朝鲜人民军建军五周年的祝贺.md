Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, February 17th: Korean People's Army Supreme Commander Marshal Kim Il Sung cabled a reply on February 16th to Chinese People's Volunteer Army Commander General Peng Dehuai, thanking him for his congratulations on the 5th anniversary of the founding of the Korean People's Army. The telegram is as follows:

To General Peng Dehuai, Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army:

I, on behalf of all officers and men of the Korean People's Army, extend my heartfelt gratitude to you and all commanders and combatants of the heroic Chinese People's Volunteer Army for your congratulations on the 5th anniversary of the founding of the Korean People's Army.

For more than two years, the Korean People's Army, in its just struggle against the armed interventionists of U.S. imperialism, has achieved brilliant victories due to the assistance of the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army fighting shoulder to shoulder with us, dealing the enemy devastating blows. This has not only defended the democratic base of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and laid the foundation for final victory, but also inspired the liberation struggle of the oppressed people of the East and made a great contribution to the cause of defending peace in Asia and the world. I believe that the Chinese People's Volunteer Army will continue to carry forward the spirit of internationalism, strengthen the fighting unity and friendship between the Chinese and Korean people's forces, and will surely shatter any new military adventures of the enemy and strive for even greater victories in the cause of opposing aggression and defending peace!

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Korean People's Army Supreme Commander Kim Il Sung
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　February 16th

    金日成元帅电复彭德怀将军
    感谢对朝鲜人民军建军五周年的祝贺
    【新华社朝鲜前线十七日电】朝鲜人民军最高司令官金日成元帅在二月十六日复电中国人民志愿军司令员彭德怀将军，感谢他对朝鲜人民军创建五周年纪念的祝贺。电文如下：中国人民志愿军司令员彭德怀将军：
    对于您在朝鲜人民军建军五周年纪念节的祝贺，我代表朝鲜人民军全体将士谨向您和英勇的中国人民志愿军全体指挥员战斗员衷心表示感谢。
    两年多以来，朝鲜人民军在反对美帝国主义武装干涉者的正义斗争中，由于中国人民和中国人民志愿军协助我们并肩作战给敌人以歼灭性的打击，已获得辉煌的胜利。这不仅保卫了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的民主基地，奠定了最后胜利的基础，并且鼓舞了东方被压迫人民的解放斗争，在保卫亚洲及世界和平事业中有了巨大的贡献。我相信今后中国人民志愿军将继续发扬国际主义精神，加强中朝人民部队间的战斗的团结友谊，一定能粉碎敌人的任何新的军事冒险，在反对侵略保卫和平事业中争取更伟大的胜利！
                           朝鲜人民军最高司令官金日成
                                 　二月十六日
