Xinhua News Agency, February 24th: To express the Japanese people's friendship and respect for China, representatives of the Japan Peace Liaison Committee, the Japan-China Friendship Association, and the Japanese Red Cross Society, representing not only the aforementioned three organizations but also the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, the All-Japan Congress of Industrial Unions, the Japan Association for the Promotion of International Trade, the Japan-China Trade Promotion Council, the Diet Members' League for Japan-China Trade Promotion, and more than forty Japanese groups from youth, women, science, literature, art, and journalism circles, presented gifts in Beijing on the 22nd to Chairman Mao Zedong and Vice-Chairman Soong Ching Ling of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China. They also presented gifts to the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the Red Cross Society of China, and other organizations. The Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and the Red Cross Society of China also presented gifts to the Japan Peace Liaison Committee, the Japan-China Friendship Association, the Japanese Red Cross Society, the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, and other organizations.

Attending the gift presentation ceremony on the Chinese side were: Guo Moruo, Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace; Chen Shutong, Vice-Chairman; Liu Ningyi and Liu Guanyi, Secretaries-General; Liao Chengzhi, Chief Representative of the Red Cross Society of China Delegation negotiating assistance for the return of Japanese nationals; Peng Zemin, Xiong Jinjing, and Hu Lansheng, Vice-Presidents of the Red Cross Society of China; Fang Ming, Vice-Chairman of the National Committee of the China Educational Workers' Union; and Liao Mengxing, Tian Demin, Wu Youxun, Xu Guangping, Cai Chusheng, Ji Chaoding, and other representatives from various people's organizations and circles, totaling more than one hundred people.

Attending the gift presentation ceremony on the Japanese side were: Tadatsugu Shimazu, President of the Japanese Red Cross Society, and Tadao Kudo, Director of Foreign Affairs; Kanzo Uchiyama, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Japan-China Friendship Association, and Toshio Kashima, Standing Director; Masaharu Hatanaka, Secretary-General of the Japan Peace Liaison Committee, and Yoshitaro Hirano and Tomi Takara, Committee Members; Koichi Saionji and Wiemon Nakamura, Japanese representatives attending the World People's Peace Congress currently in Beijing; Kumaichi Yamamoto, Chairman of the Japan-China Trade Promotion Council; Kazuo Suzuki, Standing Director of the Japan Association for the Promotion of International Trade; Miyoji Hiragaki, Central Executive Committee Member of the Japan Teachers' Union; Michio Iwamura, Director of the Japan China Research Institute; and Zenichi Sakurai, Secretary-General of the Japanese Green Cross Society, and others.

Liu Ningyi, Secretary-General of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, pointed out in his opening remarks: Every gift and letter from the Japanese people is filled with the spirit of friendship. The friendship between the Chinese and Japanese people is worth cherishing. Even during the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Chinese people recognized that the enemy of the Chinese people was only the Japanese militarists, and the Japanese people were our friends. He concluded by saying: The exchange of gifts between the Chinese and Japanese people demonstrates the will of the two peoples to defend peace in Asia and the world, and gives a powerful blow to Eisenhower's scheme of "using Asians to fight Asians."

After Liu Ningyi's speech, the Japanese and Chinese people's representatives presented gifts to each other. Vice-Chairman Chen Shutong of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace accepted the gifts presented by the Japanese representatives to Chairman Mao Zedong and Vice-Chairman Soong Ching Ling. Warm applause repeatedly erupted in the venue, demonstrating the friendship and unity between the Chinese and Japanese people.

After the gift presentation ceremony, Guo Moruo, Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, delivered a speech. After recounting historical facts about Sino-Japanese relations, Guo Moruo said: A lesson can be drawn from the history of Sino-Japanese relations: that is, if the two countries coexist peacefully and adopt a friendly attitude of learning, absorbing advanced experiences, it can guarantee the progress and happiness of their respective nations; but if they do not coexist peacefully and adopt means of aggressive warfare, the aggressor will inevitably suffer a heavy defeat. We should draw valuable lessons from these historical facts. Currently, Eisenhower is openly clamoring to "use Asians to fight Asians," which means using the Japanese to carry out aggression against the Asian and Chinese people. This policy will bring the greatest misfortune to the Japanese people. Guo Moruo expressed his deep belief that although a few Japanese are unwilling to accept historical lessons and are willing to be cat's-paws of the American reactionaries, the Japanese people will certainly rise up against them for their own progress and happiness. Guo Moruo assured Japanese friends that the Chinese people are willing to extend a hand of friendship to the Japanese people and work together to safeguard peace.

Subsequently, Tadatsugu Shimazu, Yoshitaro Hirano, Tomi Takara, Koichi Saionji, and Kumaichi Yamamoto also spoke successively. They unanimously pointed out the great significance of the precious friendship that has existed for a long time between the Chinese and Japanese people, and expressed their determination to develop this friendship in order to defend peace in Asia and the world.

The gift presentation ceremony proceeded in a warm atmosphere expressing the friendship of the Chinese and Japanese people.

    日本和平联络委员会等团体代表向毛泽东主席宋庆龄副主席献礼
    我保卫世界和平委员会副主席陈叔通代表接受
    【新华社二十四日讯】为表示日本人民对中国的友谊和敬意，日本和平联络委员会、日中友好协会和日本红十字会的代表，除代表上述三团体之外，并代表日本工会总评议会、全日本产业别工会会议、日本中日贸易促进会、日中贸易促进会议、日中贸易促进议员联盟，以及日本青年、妇女、科学、文艺、新闻等各界共四十多个日本团体，于二十二日在北京向中华人民共和国中央人民政府毛泽东主席和宋庆龄副主席献礼，并向中国人民保卫世界和平委员会、中华全国总工会、中国红十字会等团体献礼，中国人民保卫世界和平委员会、中华全国总工会、中国红十字会等团体也向日本和平联络委员会、日中友好协会、日本红十字会和日本工会总评议会等团体赠礼。
    出席献礼和赠礼仪式的，中国方面有：中国人民保卫世界和平委员会主席郭沫若、副主席陈叔通，秘书长刘宁一、刘贯一，商谈协助日侨归国问题的中国红十字会代表团首席代表廖承志、中国红十字会副会长彭泽民、熊瑾玎、胡兰生，中国教育工会全国委员会副主席方明和各人民团体、各界代表廖梦醒、田德民、吴有训、许广平、蔡楚生、冀朝鼎等一百多人。
    出席献礼和赠礼仪式的，日本方面有：日本红十字会会长岛津忠承、外事部长工藤忠夫，日中友好协会理事长内山完造、常任理事加岛敏雄，日本和平联络委员会事务局长畑中政春、委员平野义太郎、高良富女士，现在北京的出席世界人民和平大会的日本代表西园寺公一和中村玩右卫门，日本日中贸易促进会议主席山本熊一，日本中日贸易促进会常务理事铃木一雄，日本教职员工会中央执行委员平垣美代司，日本中国研究所理事岩村三千夫，日本绿十字会书记长樱井善一等人。
    中国人民保卫世界和平委员会秘书长刘宁一在致开会词时指出：日本人民每一件礼物和信件，都充满了日本人民友好的精神。中日两国人民的友谊是值得珍重的，中国人民即使在抗日战争时期，也认清中国人民的敌人只是日本军国主义者，而日本人民是我们的朋友。他最后说：中日两国人民彼此赠送礼物，表示了两国人民保卫亚洲和世界和平的意志，给予艾森豪威尔的“用亚洲人打亚洲人”的阴谋以有力的打击。
    刘宁一致词后，日本人民代表和中国人民代表彼此献礼和赠礼，日本代表献给毛泽东主席和宋庆龄副主席的礼物，由中国人民保卫世界和平委员会副主席陈叔通代表接受。会场一再发出热烈的掌声，显示了中日两国人民的友谊和团结。
    献礼和赠礼结束后，由中国人民保卫世界和平委员会主席郭沫若致词。郭沫若在追述中日两国历史事实之后说：从中日两国关系的历史中可以得出一个教训：就是两国之间如果和平共处，并采取友好学习的态度，吸收先进经验，便可以保证本民族的进步和幸福，但如果不和平共处而采取侵略战争的手段，结果侵略的一方必遭惨重失败。我们应从这些历史事实取得宝贵的教训。目前艾森豪威尔公开在叫嚣要“用亚洲人打亚洲人”，就是说要利用日本人对亚洲和中国人民进行侵略。这种政策将带给日本人民最大的不幸。郭沫若表示深信：尽管有少数日本人不肯接受历史教训愿作美国反动派的猫爪，但日本人民为了自己的进步和幸福，一定会起来反对他们。郭沫若并向日本朋友保证：中国人民愿向日本人民伸出友谊的手，共同为保障和平而努力。
    接着岛津忠承、平野义太郎、高良富、西园寺公一、山本熊一也先后讲话，他们一致指出了日中两国人民长时期存在的珍贵的友谊的巨大意义，并且表示他们一定要发展这种友谊，以保卫亚洲和世界和平。
    献礼和赠礼仪式在一种表达了中日两国人民友好的热烈气氛中进行。
