“Send People Off as Soon as They Stand Up, Send Money and Grain Immediately”
—Letter from the People of Weishe Village, Pingding County, to the China Resist America, Aid Korea General Association and the Volunteer Army

To the China People's Resist America, Aid Korea General Association and all comrades of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army:

In order to support the Korean front with greater strength, thoroughly defeat the American aggressors who refuse to give up their ambition, and defend the security of the motherland and production construction, we—the entire people of Weishe Village, Pingding County, Shanxi Province—guarantee to you: We have made all preparations to ensure the supply of manpower, materials, and financial resources to the front anytime and anywhere; send people off as soon as they stand up, and send money and grain immediately. We will do what we say and will not delay a single step.

In the past, Weishe Village was a poor village that suffered from the exploitation of landlords. Before liberation, more than 60% of the village's land was controlled by landlords and rich peasants, and more than 100 peasant households lived a life of eating bran and wild herbs. After land reform and the results of increased production in the past two or three years, our village has completely changed. In 1952, we produced more than 130,000 catties more grain than the previous year. The bran and vegetables that we couldn't live without every day in the old days are now no longer eaten by anyone. Every three to five days, we even "improve our lives" once. Three years ago, it was not uncommon for a family to share a torn quilt; now, high stacks of floral cotton quilts are piled up on the kang, and many families have also laid down woolen blankets or felt. In three years, the village has added more than 800 quilts. Things that were rare in the countryside in the past, such as foreign cloth, foreign socks, soap, scarves, and flashlights, have now become daily necessities for the masses; young people are not satisfied with foreign cloth and twill, and many people have bought呢 hats, rubber shoes,绒衣 and woolen scarves. Recently, we have also formulated a five-year construction plan. We know that even happier days are ahead.

We also know that the evil American imperialism wants to destroy our good days, and we hate it very much. At the beginning of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, more than 300 people in the village rose up to accuse imperialism and the old society of the disasters they brought us, and more than 60 young people wrote letters of determination to defend their homes and defend the country and to obey the motherland's dispatch. The women in the village automatically launched a savings movement, donating patriotic rice savings on the first and fifteenth of each month. This movement later developed into the patriotic inspection day system that has now been promoted throughout the country. Every half month, we inspect and revise the patriotic pact once (so far, the patriotic pacts of each family have been revised 32 times), and carry out mass patriotic inspections and criticism and education to supervise each other to realize the patriotic pact.

At the Patriotic Inspection Day meetings, we often heard the victory news from the Korean front and learned about the heroic stories of the Volunteer Army comrades fighting the enemy. We miss the front line all the time. In the patriotic production increase movement, every family regarded the work of preferential treatment and substitute cultivation as the most important patriotic action. We once guaranteed that the yield of the land of military families in the village should be as much as everyone else. This guarantee has been realized. In 1952, all 59 mu of cultivated land for the eight families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel in the village achieved a bumper harvest, with an average increase of 6斗8升 of grain per mu compared to the previous year, and exceeding the village's average yield by more than 2斗. Among them, more than 8 mu and 2 points of land reached high yields, with each mu of jade corn harvesting 560 catties and millet 449 catties.

When working, everyone has done "military families first, then ourselves." Helping military families anytime and anywhere has become everyone's favorite job. Everyone thinks it is glorious to do so. For example, women and children in the neighborhood automatically help military families with burning coal, drinking water, and using soil. Some military families cannot do needlework, so several women help them. If a military family is sick, many people go to comfort them, decoct medicine, and invite doctors. During the New Year and festivals, everyone is happy to send gifts to the families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel to express their feelings.

The village government sends letters to the twelve military comrades in the village every season, reporting on the production and living conditions of their families. We have also received many letters from the front, in which they report the victory news and express their determination to kill the enemy, which gives us great encouragement.

Since January 3rd of this year, we have also universally conducted a study on Resist America, Aid Korea. For several consecutive days, we studied and discussed the China Resist America, Aid Korea General Association's instructions on continuing to strengthen the Resist America, Aid Korea work, and reviewed last year's Resist America, Aid Korea work, and also corrected the complacent and paralyzed thinking that some people once had, and resolved to strengthen the various tasks instructed by the China Resist America, Aid Korea General Association. The village's armed forces, youth, women, and other departments have all written guarantees and set out the direction of their efforts to regularly strengthen the Resist America, Aid Korea work in the future.

The entire people of Weishe Village, Pingding County, Shanxi Province
January 10th

    “要人站起就走，要钱要粮马上就送”
    ——平定县维社村群众给抗美援朝总会和志愿军的信中国人民抗美援朝总会并转中国人民志愿军全体同志们：
    为了用更大的力量支援朝鲜前线，彻底打败野心不退的美国侵略者，保卫祖国的安全和生产建设，我们——山西平定县维社村全体民众向你们保证：我们已经作好一切准备，保证随时随地以人力物力财力供应前方；要人站起就走，要钱要粮马上就送。说到作到，决不迟慢一步。
    我们维社村过去是一个受尽地主剥削的穷村子，解放以前，全村土地百分之六十以上掌握在地主富农手里，一百多户农民家家过着吃糠咽菜的生活。经过土地改革和两三年来提高生产的结果，我们村子完全变样了。一九五二年，我们比前一年多打了十三万多斤粮食。旧日天天离不了的糠菜，现在再也没有人吃它了。隔个三天五天，还要“改善生活”一次。三年以前，一家人伙盖一条破被子的不算稀奇；现在炕头上叠起高高的花洋布被子，许多人家还铺上了线毯或毛毡。三年中全村添了被子八百多条。过去在农村里算稀罕的东西，像洋布、洋袜、香皂、围巾、手电筒，现在已成为群众的日常用品；青年人对洋布、斜纹布还不满意，很多人买了呢帽、胶鞋、绒衣和毛围巾。最近，我们又订出了五年建设计划，我们知道，更幸福的日子还在后头。
    我们也知道，万恶的美帝国主义是想破坏我们的好日子的，我们万分痛恨它。在抗美援朝运动刚开始的时候，全村有三百多人起来控诉了帝国主义和旧社会给咱们的祸害，有六十多个青年写了保家卫国、听候祖国调遣的决心书。村里的妇女，自动开展了一个节约运动，每月初一、十五交纳一次爱国米节约捐献。这个运动，后来发展成了现在已经在全国推广的爱国检查日制度。我们每隔半月检查修订一次爱国公约（至今各家的爱国公约已修订了三十二次），并展开群众性的爱国检查和批评教育，互相督促实现爱国公约。
    在爱国检查日会议上，我们时常听到朝鲜前线的胜利消息，并且知道了志愿军同志英勇杀敌的故事。我们时时刻刻想念着前线。在爱国增产运动中，家家都把优抚代耕工作当做一件最重要的爱国行动。我们曾保证全村军属土地的产量要和大家一样多。这个保证实现了。全村八户烈属军属的五十九亩代耕地，一九五二年全部得到丰收，平均每亩比前一年多收六斗八升粮食，并超过全村平均产量二斗多。其中还有八亩二分多地达到了高额产量，每亩玉茭收了五百六十斤，谷子四百四十九斤。
    大家在干活时，都做到了“先军属，后自己”。随时随地帮助军属，已成为每一个人最喜欢做的工作。大家都认为这样做是光荣的。比如，军属们烧煤、吃水、用土等，都有左近妇女和儿童自动地帮着做。有的军属不能做针线活，就有几家妇女去帮她们。如果有军属生病时，就有许多人去慰问，熬药，请医生。过年过节，大家都高兴给烈属军属送点礼物表表心意。
    村里的十二位军人同志，村政府按季节都给他们去信，报告他们家里的生产和生活情况。我们也接到前方不少来信，他们向我们报告胜利消息，表示杀敌决心，这给我们很大的鼓舞。
    今年一月三日起，我们又普遍地进行了一次关于抗美援朝的学习。一连几天学习和讨论抗美援朝总会关于继续加强抗美援朝工作的指示，并且检查了去年的抗美援朝工作，也纠正了某些人一度有过的轻敌麻痹思想，决心加强抗美援朝总会指示的各项工作。村里武装、青年、妇女等各部门，都写了保证书，定出了今后经常加强抗美援朝工作的努力方向。山西平定县维社村全体民众
            一月十日
