    "Compilation of the People's Republic of China Yin-Yang Calendar for Three Years" Contains Errors
    A letter from Yi Ping: According to the precise calculations of the Zijinshan Astronomical Observatory of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the lunar calendar for 1953 should have "a large sixth month and a small seventh month." Recently, I saw in the "Compilation of the People's Republic of China Yin-Yang Calendar for Three Years" published and distributed jointly by Beijing Xuegutang Bookstore, Ziqiang Bookstore, Wanju Bookstore, and Wanguo Bookstore, that the sixth lunar month of 1953 was marked as a "small month" and the seventh month as a "large month." This is obviously wrong. I hope that these four bookstores will correct the unsold books and that those who have already bought the book will correct this error.

### “中华人民共和国阴阳合历三年汇编”有错误

    “中华人民共和国阴阳合历三年汇编”有错误
    一平来信：依照中国科学院紫金山天文台精确推算，一九五三年阴历为“六月大，七月小”。最近我看到北京学古堂书店、自强书局、万聚书局和万国书局共同出版、发行的“中华人民共和国阴阳合历三年汇编”一书中，把一九五三年阴历六月作为“小月”，七月作为“大月”。这显然是错误的。希望这四家书店将未卖出的书加以修正，并望已买了这本书的人把这个错误改正过来。
