    The North China Administrative Committee was formally established on February 9th and held its first meeting of committee members on the 9th and 10th. Twenty-six members attended, and those present as observers included the directors and deputy directors of various bureaus of the North China Administrative Committee, as well as the heads of the people's governments of various provinces and cities in North China and various people's organizations at the North China level.

    After Vice Chairman Li Zhuchen announced the opening of the meeting, Chairman Liu Lantao, based on Chairman Mao's call at the Fourth Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the three major tasks proposed in Vice Chairman Zhou's political report, combined with the specific situation in the North China region, made a report on several major work tasks for the North China region in 1953. First, it was pointed out that under the circumstances of American imperialism's conspiracy to expand its aggression in the Korean War, we must further strengthen the struggle to resist American aggression and aid Korea and strive for greater victory. To this end, we must strengthen patriotic education, prevent and correct complacency and slackness, and strengthen support for the Chinese People's Volunteers in terms of manpower and materials, conscientiously do a good job in supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to the families of soldiers, farming on their behalf, and treating and comforting the wounded and sick soldiers of the Volunteers. Regarding industrial construction in the North China region, after explaining that the focus of our country's construction is industrial construction, especially heavy industry construction, it was emphasized that the main task of the North China region is to ensure and supervise state-owned factories and mines to complete and overfulfill the state plan. This requires strengthening planning management, improving quality, strengthening technical management, reducing costs, strengthening cost and financial management, striving for all major factories and mines to earnestly do a good job in economic accounting, and elevating the task of strengthening basic construction and accumulating basic construction experience to a primary position. In agricultural production in the North China region, we must further develop the mutual aid and cooperation movement and the patriotic production increase competition movement, vigorously promote advanced experience and science and technology, and universally increase the yield per unit area to increase the production of grain, industrial raw materials, and export goods, and should, according to different conditions, develop forestry, animal husbandry, and fishery in a planned way. In his report, Chairman Liu Lantao further emphasized that in order to fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses in resisting American aggression and aiding Korea and to effectively lead and guarantee the smooth progress of national construction, the central task of the construction of people's democratic power in the North China region this year should be to convene people's congresses at the township, county, and provincial (city) levels through universal suffrage, in accordance with the electoral law for people's congresses formulated by the central government. Before the township elections in various places, the work of dividing townships must be completed by the end of May, based on the principles of facilitating administrative leadership, mass production, and taking care of natural conditions. Liu Lantao then elaborated in detail on financial, trade, cultural and educational, health, and ethnic work, and pointed out that this year's tasks in the North China region are glorious and arduous. In order to complete the above tasks, we must improve our leadership methods and leadership style, pay special attention to strengthening ideological and political leadership, strengthening the democratic life of leadership organs at all levels, carrying out criticism and self-criticism, especially bottom-up criticism, resolutely oppose bureaucracy and commandism, and severely punish all law-breaking and discipline-violating elements. At the same time, in order to ensure the correct implementation of various policies, responsible cadres at all levels and in all departments must conduct in-depth inspections and assist in work at the grassroots level in a planned and purposeful manner. Staff members at all levels and in all departments should do everything possible to closely connect with the masses, listen to their opinions, care about their hardships, and pay special attention to properly handling letters and visits from the masses. We must establish a global perspective among all cadres, implement the idea of centralized and unified leadership, obey the state plan, and overcome departmentalism. Strengthen cadres' theoretical and professional learning, improve their ideological and policy level, and master their own business to meet the needs of large-scale national construction.

    After listening to Chairman Liu Lantao's report, the committee members present believed that it fully complied with the instructions of Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou, and was completely suitable for the actual situation in the North China region; they unanimously expressed their support. During the discussion, Committee Member Zhou Shutao said that learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union is very important in industrial production and should be developed into a mass movement. Committee Member Deng Chumin emphasized the leading role of the state-owned economic component in economic construction, while strengthening guidance for private enterprises and helping them improve their technology and management. Committee Member Dong Qiwu, based on what he had seen in rural areas, believed that we should actively strengthen the propaganda and education work of resisting American aggression and aiding Korea and further do a good job in supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to the families of soldiers. Committee Member Zhang Guofan said that combining leadership with the masses is the only way to do a good job; on the one hand, we must strengthen leadership, and on the other hand, we must strengthen democratic life; fully promoting democracy is precisely to strengthen leadership. Committee Member Wang Congwu pointed out in his speech that we must continue to carry out the struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline; fully use newspapers and other propaganda tools to vigorously expose and criticize them, and strengthen people's supervision work, strictly enforce state discipline, and resolutely carry out active work and struggle to eliminate bureaucracy, commandism, and law-breaking and discipline-violating phenomena. In addition, Zhang Youyu, Shu Sheyu, Wang Baozhen, Wang Yunsheng, Li Shunda, Fu Huating, and other committee members, made many valuable suggestions on strengthening the struggle to resist American aggression and aid Korea, industrial and agricultural production, culture and education, health, ethnic work, and improving leadership, and expressed their confidence in completing this year's work tasks in the North China region.

    The meeting was finally summarized by Chairman Liu Lantao. He explained that opposing American imperialism is a long-term task and we must further strengthen the work of resisting American aggression and aiding Korea; he emphasized that increasing production and practicing economy is a fundamental issue, and we must widely carry out propaganda and education among all staff members and the masses in the North China region, mobilize and organize people from all walks of life and all ethnic groups to work together to victoriously complete the great tasks of 1953.
