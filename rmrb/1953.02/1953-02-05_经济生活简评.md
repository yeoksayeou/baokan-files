    Economic Life Brief Comments
    Prevent and Control Wheat Pests Early
    Wheat pests are the biggest enemy of wheat yield increase. Last year, major wheat-producing areas such as Henan, Shaanxi, and southern Shanxi suffered severely from wheat aphids, red spiders, and wheat blossom midges. In southern Shanxi Province, wheat production decreased by 20% compared to 1951 due to pest damage and other natural disasters.
    The reason why wheat pests were so rampant last year was mainly due to the negligence of cadres and farmers in various regions, who lacked prevention and timely treatment. Some regions did not even notice the occurrence of pests in the early stages; others were unprepared and panicked when dealing with the pests, resulting in poor results. Most regions were treating wheat pests under emergency conditions. Although this reduced the loss of wheat, it wasted a lot of manpower and materials. We should deeply remember these lessons.
    Cadres and farmers in all wheat-producing areas should be vigilant, learn from last year's lessons, and pay attention to checking and preventing wheat pests early, and must not allow pests to spread due to negligence, endangering the task of increasing wheat production.
    Regions Lacking Water Sources Should Lead the Masses to Accumulate Snow
    Accumulating snow and storing ice in farmland is an important way to prevent spring drought and increase production. In cultivated land where snow is accumulated and ice is stored, crops emerge earlier and more uniformly, and yields are also significantly improved. Tao Tiesuo, a high-yield wheat farmer in Longjiang County, Heilongjiang Province, transported 160,000 catties of ice and snow to the fields the winter before last, and last year each hectare of his wheat yielded 7,200 catties. The Keshan County Agricultural Experiment Station in Northeast China used sorghum stalks to dam snow on high ground (placing a bundle of sorghum stalks every ten meters) the winter before last, and last year each hectare of wheat yielded a high output of 6,200 catties.
    The Soviet Union attaches great importance to snow accumulation. According to the experience of a collective farm in the Novoanninsky District of the Stalingrad Region in the Soviet Union, under the same cultivation and fertilization conditions, before 1950, due to the lack of snow accumulation, only 7 to 8 quintals of spring wheat were harvested per hectare. In the winter of 1950 and the spring of 1951, snow accumulation was implemented, and the wheat harvest immediately reached 12 quintals per hectare.
    There are many methods of snow accumulation. The methods commonly used in our country are to sweep and collect snow from mountain slopes, roads, and ditches after snowfall and transport it to the fields; or to dam snow in the fields with sorghum stalks. The Soviet Union also uses methods such as planting shelterbelts, leaving stubble in the fields, building snow ridges, and inserting snow fences to reduce the wind speed near the ground, so that most of the snow remains in the ground and seeps into the soil to increase the moisture in the cultivated layer of the soil.
    All regions that lack water sources, cannot dig wells, and have conditions for snow accumulation should pay attention to snow accumulation. However, in carrying out this work, it is necessary to strictly prevent coercion and commandism, and it is also necessary to pay attention to adapting to local conditions. In 1951, in Tangshan Prefecture, Hebei Province, because the masses were forced to accumulate snow and carry ice, some pregnant women even had miscarriages due to carrying snow up the mountains. In some areas of northern Chahar Province, it only took four or five man-days to dig a well, which could preserve moisture for three mu, but the local cadres insisted that the masses carry snow, and as a result, forty or fifty people carrying ice and snow for a day could only preserve moisture for one mu. These practices are all wrong and should be prevented.

    及早防治小麦虫害
    小麦害虫是小麦增产的最大的敌人。去年主要产麦区的河南、陕西和山西南部等地区，都受到麦蚜虫、红蜘蛛、小麦吸浆虫的严重危害。山西省南部地区的小麦因虫害及其他自然灾害的袭击，曾比一九五一年减产二成。
    去年小麦虫害所以猖獗一时，主要是由于各地干部和农民对虫害麻痹大意，没有预防和及时除治。有的地区在虫害发生初期还没有察觉；有的地区因为没有充分进行准备，在除治害虫时，手脚慌乱，效果不大。大部地区都是在抢救情况下除治麦虫的。这样虽然减了小麦的损失，但浪费了不少人力、物力。这些教训，我们是应该深切记取的。
    各产麦区的干部和农民应提高警惕，吸取去年的教训，及早注意检查和防治小麦虫害，切勿因麻痹大意而使虫害蔓延，危害小麦的增产任务。
    缺乏水源的地区应领导群众积雪
    在农田中积雪蓄冰，是防止春旱，增加生产的重要办法之一。在积雪蓄冰的耕地上，庄稼出苗早而整齐，产量也显著提高。黑龙江省龙江县小麦丰产户陶铁锁，在前年冬天往地里送了十六万斤冰雪，去年每垧小麦得到了七千二百斤的产量。东北克山县农业试验场前年冬天用秫秸在高地坝雪（每隔十公尺放一捆秫秸），去年每垧小麦获得六千二百斤的高额产量。
    苏联是很重视积雪的。据苏联斯大林格勒州新安宁区一个集体农庄的经验，在一切都相同的耕作条件和施肥条件之下，一九五○年以前，由于没有积雪，每公顷春麦仅收获七到八公担。一九五○年冬和一九五一年春实行积雪，每垧小麦收获立即达到了十二公担。
    积雪的方法很多。我国通常采用的方法是在雪后扫集山坡、道路、沟渠里的雪，送到田里去；或以秫秸在田间坝雪。苏联还采用种植防护林带、田间留茬、起雪埂、插雪篱等办法，以减低接近地面的风速，使大部分雪留在地里，渗入土中，以增加土壤耕层的水分。
    凡缺乏水源，无法凿井，又有条件积雪的地区，都应注意积雪。但在进行这一工作时，必须严格防止强迫命令，也必须注意因地制宜。一九五一年，河北省唐山专区因强迫群众积雪背冰，有的孕妇竟因背雪上山而小产了。原察哈尔省北部一些地区打一眼井只需四、五个人工，可保墒三亩，但当地干部一定要群众背雪，结果四五十个人背一天冰雪，仅能保墒一亩。这些作法都是错误的，要注意防止。
