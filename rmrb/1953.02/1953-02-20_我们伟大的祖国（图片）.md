    Our Great Motherland
    A section of the Yakeshi Forest Railway in the Greater Khingan Range, from Kutuer to Tulihe, was partially opened to traffic in early November last year. This is of great importance for the development of the forests of the Greater Khingan Range, and it has also brought economic prosperity to this remote forest area. This is a scene of railway engineering troops continuing to build forest railways in the harsh winter.
