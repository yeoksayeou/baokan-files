In order to carry out the work of supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of soldiers in a planned and step-by-step manner during the Spring Festival, various localities have successively established institutions to lead this work.

In the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, banners (counties) and sumu (districts) have also established organizations to lead the work of supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of soldiers. In the ice-bound city of Dihua, the Preferential Treatment Committee composed of people from all ethnic groups and all walks of life is working hard.

During the Spring Festival, various localities will widely carry out propaganda work to conduct in-depth ideological education on resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea among people from all walks of life, publicize the fine qualities of the people's army and the heroic achievements of the Chinese People's Volunteers, as well as the significance of supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of soldiers.

The Shenyang Municipal Cultural Center is compiling various propaganda programs in preparation for the Spring Festival performance. People from all walks of life in Hunan Province and Dihua City are preparing to organize propaganda teams and use various methods such as blackboards and broadcasts to widely publicize the heroic deeds of the Volunteers and the model examples of the families of martyrs and soldiers, and revolutionary disabled soldiers to encourage the people to strengthen the work of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea and further improve the work of supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of soldiers.

People in various places are actively preparing to hold get-togethers with the local People's Liberation Army during the Spring Festival and to extend their regards to the families of martyrs and soldiers, revolutionary disabled soldiers, and wounded and sick Volunteers. All districts in Beijing have prepared to hold army-civilian get-togethers and invite garrison troops, families of martyrs and soldiers, etc., to participate. A delegation of comfort, including representatives from all walks of life, has begun to be organized. Wuhan City will hold a city-wide army-government-civilian get-together.

The Central South Region, the Northwest Region, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Suiyuan Province, and Taiyuan City have all organized or are organizing comfort groups or teams to carry out comfort work during the Spring Festival. The Central South Comfort Group, jointly composed of the CPC Central South Bureau, the Central South Administrative Committee, and the Central South Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, is preparing to go to Hankou, Hunan, Jiangxi, and other places before and after the Spring Festival to carry out comfort activities. The comfort group jointly formed by the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and Suiyuan Province will be divided into five groups to go to GuiSui, Baotou, Sa County, and other places to carry out comfort work; and another comfort team will be organized to go to Suixi Micang County to comfort the family members of Liu Guangzi, who had performed meritorious service on the front lines in Korea and won the title of Second-Class Lone Hero.
