Chairman, fellow members, comrades:
　　At the first meeting, after listening to Vice Chairman Zhou's political report, Vice Chairman Chen Shutong's report on the work of the Standing Committee of the CPPCC, and Deputy Head Guo Moruo's report on the proceedings and achievements of the World People's Peace Congress, we scientific workers and young people express our heartfelt support. We are determined to contribute our utmost to achieving the three major tasks of this year – continuing to strengthen the resistance against U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, completing and overfulfilling the 1953 construction plan, and implementing universal suffrage.
　　Until the founding of the Central People's Government, due to the semi-feudal and semi-colonial nature of Chinese society in the past, and because modern science was mainly imported into China by students who had studied in Europe, America, and Japan, the ideological consciousness of the vast majority of Chinese scientific workers was strongly influenced by bourgeois thought, carrying a semi-colonial and semi-feudal flavor. However, in the past three years, thanks to the care and cultivation of the People's Government for scientific undertakings, under the conditions of unprecedented political unity and economic stability, Chinese scientific workers have also carried out self-reform in a series of national mass movements, enhancing their understanding of how science should serve the people.
　　First is the adjustment and enrichment of national scientific research institutions. In the past, due to the influence of sectarianism and unplanned development, scientific institutions often had overlapping and redundant phenomena, with scattered human resources. After the adjustment, each institution has a clear task, concentrated manpower, and sufficient funding, thus ending the situation of being unable to develop due to insufficient funding or lack of attention forever. The recent adjustment of departments in universities and colleges can better solve the major task of training a large number of construction talents according to the needs of national construction, thus ensuring that the scientific team will have an increasingly strong and healthy reserve force.
　　In the past three years, on the fronts of economic, national defense, and cultural construction, a large number of scientific workers, especially young scientific workers, have actively participated in the people's construction cause. They have studied the manufacture and improvement of industrial equipment, industrial raw materials, and medicines, participated in huge water conservancy projects, conducted the exploration of underground resources, participated in the modernization of national defense forces, promoted national medical and health work, and carried out a series of basic scientific research related to production. Particularly worth mentioning is their work in Korea and Northeast China with a high degree of scientific anti-epidemic and inspection work in the spirit of patriotism and internationalism, helping the army and people to overcome the bacteriological weapons of American imperialism, playing a major role in exposing the aggression plot of American imperialism and consolidating the world peace and democracy camp, and also creating a typical example of the combination of theory and practice in scientific research.
　　Chairman Mao pointed out in his opening speech at the Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in October 1951: "Ideological reform, especially the ideological reform of various intellectuals, is one of the important conditions for our country to thoroughly realize democratic reform in all aspects and gradually implement industrialization." In his New Year's greetings in 1952, he called on us to strive for "victory on the ideological reform front in all walks of life, especially among intellectuals." In accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions, last year teachers and scientific researchers in universities and colleges gained important achievements on this ideological reform front. First, they severely opposed various remaining reactionary thoughts, such as pro-American, anti-Soviet, and anti-Communist thoughts, and also seriously criticized the rather widespread reformist thoughts, the thoughts of separating from politics, separating from reality, and pursuing academics for the sake of academics, sectarianism, and liberalism, as well as the crude and shoddy style of work. In this way, scientific workers have more clearly recognized that theory should be linked with practice, and research work must be correctly and closely combined with the direction of national construction. Based on this new understanding, the vast majority of scientific workers enthusiastically participated in the work of formulating research plans based on the actual needs put forward by various business departments and the special nature of their disciplines. Through this reform movement, their political enthusiasm has been greatly enhanced, and they are eagerly demanding to study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and to learn from the advanced science of the Soviet Union. In order to be able to more smoothly follow the path taken by the Soviet Union, many of them collectively rushed to professionally read Russian, and in four weeks they were able to read relevant Soviet monographs. Many older scientists also completed this rush task enthusiastically and victoriously, just like the young people.
　　After three years of preparation and study, although our scientific team is still too weak to meet all the requirements of the people's construction cause for science, it has made significant progress compared to the situation three years ago. In the future, under the correct leadership and close care of the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government, we believe that we can learn from the example of Soviet scientific workers and strive to realize the economic construction, national defense construction, and cultural construction of the first five-year plan.
　　On the other hand, Chinese youth have displayed their courage and wisdom on all fronts of defending and building the motherland. In the People's Volunteer Army, they launched the "achieve merits for the people of the motherland" and "avenge the Korean people" killing enemy competitions; in industrial and mining enterprises, they launched the patriotic production increase and thrift movement and promoted and created advanced production experience; and in agricultural production, they also launched the patriotic high yield and mutual aid and cooperation movement. In all these patriotic movements, tens of thousands of people's heroes and labor models have emerged, and their outstanding representatives include: Air Force hero Zhang Ji-hui, enemy-killing warrior Cai Jin, solo courage hero Huang Xin-liang, super-axis operation pioneer Zheng Xi-kun, Huai River control model Zhu Huai-shun, wheat high-yield model Cui Yu-xia, quick literacy method founder Qi Jian-hua, and Gao Yu-bao, who became the author of a 300,000-word novel through self-study from illiteracy.
　　At the beginning of the first five-year national construction plan, in addition to continuing to do a good job in resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, our primary task is to intensify the study of science, master technology, and strive to complete and over fulfill the construction plan. We must mobilize the broad masses of young people to actively participate in the propaganda and election work of the National and local people's congresses, and welcome the convening of the National People's Congress!
　　Finally, let us shout for the Chinese Communist Party and our great mentor Chairman Mao Zedong, who have victoriously led us to complete the recovery and preparation work in the past three years, and will continue to lead us to build a new democratic country and move towards socialism:
　　Long live the Chinese Communist Party!
　　Long live Chairman Mao Zedong!

### 政协全国委员会委员  钱三强的发言

专栏：

    政协全国委员会委员
    钱三强的发言主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    在第一天大会上，听到了周副主席的政治报告、陈叔通副主席政协常务委员会的会务报告和郭沫若副团长关于世界人民和平大会的经过和成就的报告，我们科学工作者和青年们都表示衷心的拥护。我们决定为实现今年的三大任务——继续加强抗美援朝、完成和超额完成一九五三年度的建设计划、实行普选——贡献出我们最大的力量。
    直到中央人民政府成立的时候，由于过去中国社会的半封建和半殖民地性质，由于近代的科学主要是由欧美日留学生输入到中国，因而极大多数的中国科学工作者的思想意识是浓厚地受着资产阶级思想的影响，带着半殖民地半封建的气味。但是三年来，由于人民政府对于科学事业的关怀与培养，在空前的政治统一、经济稳定的条件下，中国的科学工作者在一系列全国范围的广大人民群众的运动中，也进行了自我改造，提高了科学应如何为人民服务的认识。
    首先是全国科学研究机构的调整与充实。过去由于宗派主义的影响与无计划发展的原因，科学机构常有重叠、骈枝的现象，人力分散。调整后，每个机构任务分明，人力集中，经费充足，从此就永远地结束了因经费不足或不受注意而不能发展的局面。最近高等学校的院系调整，更能按照国家建设需要，解决大量培养各种建设人才的重大任务，这样，就保证了科学的队伍将有日益雄厚的、健全的后备军。
    三年来，在经济、国防、文化建设的战线上，大批的科学工作者，特别是青年科学工作者，积极地参加了人民建设事业，他们研究了工业器材、工业原料和药物的制造与改进，参加了巨大的水利工程，进行了地下资源的勘察，参加了近代化的国防部队，推广了全国医药卫生工作和进行了一系列与生产事业有关系的基本科学研究。其中特别值得提出的是他们以爱国主义与国际主义的精神在朝鲜与东北从事高度科学性的防疫和检验工作，帮助军队和人民战胜了美国帝国主义的细菌武器，对揭露美国帝国主义的侵略阴谋和巩固世界和平民主阵营，起了重大的作用，同时也创造了一个科学研究中理论联系实际的典型实例。
    毛主席在一九五一年十月中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第三次会议的开会词中指出：“思想改造，首先是各种知识分子的思想改造，是我国在各方面彻底实现民主改革和逐步实行工业化的重要条件之一。”在一九五二年元旦的祝词中又号召我们争取“在社会各界首先是知识分子的思想改造战线上的胜利。”遵照毛主席的指示，去年高等学校教师和科学研究人员在这思想改造战线上是得到了重要的收获。首先严厉地反对了各种残存的反动思想，如亲美、反苏、反共的思想，同时也严肃地批判了相当普遍存在着的改良主义思想，脱离政治、脱离实际、为学术而学术的思想，宗派主义和自由主义的思想，以及粗制滥造的作风。这样，使科学工作者更加明确地认识了理论联系实际，研究工作必须正确地、密切地结合国家建设的方向。本着这个新的认识，极大多数的科学工作者都热烈地参加了根据各业务部门所提出的实际需要和本门科学的特殊性质进行制订研究计划的工作。经过这次改造运动，他们的政治积极性已大为提高，迫切地要求学习马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想，学习苏联的先进科学。为了能更顺利地走苏联所走的路，他们有许多人集体地突击了俄文专业阅读，四个星期的时间已经能阅读苏联的有关专著了。不少的老年科学家也与青年们一样，热烈地、胜利地完成了这个突击任务。
    经过这三年来的准备与学习，虽然我们的科学队伍还太薄弱，尚不能满足人民建设事业对科学所提出的所有要求，但比到三年前的情况，已有了显著的进步。今后在中国共产党和中央人民政府的正确领导和密切关怀下，我们相信我们一定能学习苏联科学工作者的榜样，为实现第一个五年计划的经济建设、国防建设和文化建设而奋斗。
    另一方面，中国的青年在保卫和建设祖国事业的各个战线上，发挥了他们的勇敢和智慧。在人民志愿军中开展了“为祖国人民立功”“为朝鲜人民报仇”的杀敌竞赛；在工矿企业中开展了爱国增产节约运动并推广和创造了先进生产经验；在农业生产中也开展了爱国丰产和互助合作运动。在这一切爱国主义的运动中涌现出成千成万的人民英雄和劳动模范，他们的杰出的代表有：空军英雄张积慧，杀敌勇士蔡金，独胆英雄黄新良，超轴作业首创者郑锡坤，治淮模范祝怀顺，小麦丰产模范崔玉霞，速成识字法的创始者祁建华，由文盲自学而成为三十万字小说作者高玉宝等。
    在第一个五年国家建设计划开始的时候，我们青年们除去继续作好抗美援朝的工作以外，我们首要的任务是加紧学习科学，精通技术，为完成与超额完成建设计划而奋斗。我们要发动广大青年，积极参加全国和地方各级人民代表大会的宣传和选举工作，迎接全国人民代表大会的召开！
    最后，让我们为胜利地领导我们完成了三年来的恢复及准备工作，和仍将领导我们为建设新民主主义国家并向着社会主义前进的中国共产党和我们的伟大的导师毛泽东主席高呼：
    中国共产党万岁！
    毛泽东主席万岁！
