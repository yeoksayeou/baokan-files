    Jiangxi Timber Company Wucheng Office and Other Units: Chaotic Work Causes Damage to Large Quantities of Timber and Lashing Ropes
    Letters from Cheng Jinman, Wang Xueyin, and Dong Moshu: The Wucheng Office of the Jiangxi Provincial Timber Company and the Wucheng Timber Collection Yard of the Jiujiang Branch Company do not cherish state property, resulting in losses of over 4 billion yuan in timber, lashing ropes, anchor boats, etc. In June of last year, the office and the branch company stored more than 30,000 bundles of timber on the river surface in Wucheng Town, Fifth District, Xinjian County, Jiangxi Province. In principle, it should have been secured with ten or more large cables to ensure safety, but they only used three, resulting in all the stored timber being washed away by the water. After rescue efforts, more than 2,300 bundles (equivalent to over 3,700 cubic meters) were still lost. Calculating at a minimum price of 800,000 yuan per bundle, the loss amounts to 1.8 to 1.9 billion yuan, not including rescue costs.
    The office and the branch company's work is chaotic. Leading cadres usually lack education for the custodians, and no one is responsible for the stored timber, so the timber numbers are unclear. For example, in Manshanbianye, Wucheng, Xinjian County, timber is piled up haphazardly. The timber stored in the Qixianggong Temple warehouse in Wucheng has no numbers, and the doors are not locked, only labeled "Wucheng Office Wooden Pile No. 44." Because no one is responsible, another batch of timber stored on the river surface was not moved in time when the water level dropped, and 50,000 to 60,000 bundles of long timber were stranded on the river beach, some buried in the mud and already beginning to rot. The loss of lashing ropes alone is over 1.2 billion yuan, and the loss of labor and rotten timber is even more difficult to calculate. No less than 16,000 pine and fir logs stored in the Houhe area of Wucheng have rotted into mud, resulting in a loss of over 1.3 billion yuan. The situation of anchor boats being left on river beaches and in valleys to rot due to lack of management is also very serious.
    We believe that the office and the branch company should conduct a thorough inspection of the above situation, and the Jiangxi Timber Company should also promptly inspect these issues and take serious action.

### 江西木材公司吴城办事处等单位  工作混乱损坏大批木材缆草

专栏：读者来信摘要

    江西木材公司吴城办事处等单位工作混乱损坏大批木材缆草
    成金满、王雪银、董谟树来信：江西省木材公司吴城办事处和九江分公司吴城集材场不爱护国家资财，使木材、缆草、锚船等受到四十多亿元的损失。去年六月间，该办事处和该分公司在江西省新建县第五区吴城镇的河面存材三万多两，照理应用十根以上大缆缠好才可保安全，但他们却只用了三根，以致全部存材被水冲去。经抢救后，仍损失了二千三百多两（合三千七百多立方公尺）。每两平均按最低价八十万元计算，损失即达十八九亿元，抢救费用等尚未计算在内。
    该办事处和该分公司工作混乱，领导干部平时对保管人员缺乏教育，存材无人负责，存材数字都弄不清楚。如新建县吴城漫山遍野都是木材，横七竖八乱堆；吴城七相公庙仓库内所存木材，既没有数字，也不将门户封锁起来，仅写“吴城办事处木兜一大堆，四十四号”。由于无人负责，另一批河面存材因水位下降时不及时迁移，五、六万两长木搁浅河滩，有的淤在泥中已开始腐烂。这一损失，仅缆草就在十二亿元以上，人工和腐烂木材的损失更难以计算。存在吴城后河一带的松段杉筒已腐烂如泥的不下一万六千根，损失约十三亿元以上。锚船因无人管理，任其搁置河滩山洼以致霉烂的情况也很严重。
    我们认为该办事处和该分公司对上述情况应作深刻检查，江西木材公司亦应迅速对这些问题加以检查并作严肃处理。
