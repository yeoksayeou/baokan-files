    Liu Liu writes: Agriculture in Hami Prefecture, Xinjiang, made great progress last year. Grain production in Hami County increased by more than 66 percent compared to the previous year, with an average yield of 360 jin per mu. In the past, local farmers believed that weeds were the "mother of wheat" and never weeded; in some areas, farmers did not even plow furrows before sowing, but rather scattered seeds while riding on horseback. As a result, when the wheat ripened, the weeds were taller than the wheat, and the wheat harvest was very poor. Last year, with the strong call and help of the People's Government, the farmers actively built water conservancy projects, improved farming methods, plowed furrows for sowing, applied more fertilizer, and diligently weeded. Eleven agricultural bumper harvest mutual aid teams emerged in the county, with the highest yield averaging 816 jin per mu. Yang Maozhi (Han nationality), a bumper harvest model from Gongshang Village, Sanbao District, created a record of 1,040 jin per mu of spring wheat (the bumper harvest land was 3.75 mu). Zhenxi County is a semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral area. Last year, the People's Government organized impoverished Kazakh herdsmen to engage in agricultural production. With grain to eat, the herdsmen no longer slaughtered livestock casually. In addition, the People's Government went to the countryside to purchase local specialties from the herdsmen, and animal husbandry also developed greatly.

专栏：读者来信摘要

    新疆哈密专区农产丰收
    刘流来信：新疆哈密专区去年农业得到很大发展。哈密县各种粮食比前年增产百分之六十六强，每亩平均产量三百六十市斤。过去当地农民认为草是麦子的母亲，从不锄草；有些地区的农民还不犁沟下种，而是骑在马上撒种；因此在麦子黄熟的时候，草比麦子还高，麦子收成很坏。去年在人民政府大力号召和帮助下，农民们积极兴修水利，改良耕作法，犁沟撒种，多上粪，勤锄草。全县出现了农业丰产互助组十一个，产量最高的每亩平均八百十六市斤。三堡区一乡宫上村丰产模范杨茂之（汉族）创造了每市亩一千零四十市斤的春小麦丰收的纪录（丰产地有三点七五市亩）。镇西县是个半农半牧区，去年人民政府组织贫苦的哈萨克牧民进行农业生产。牧民们有了粮食吃，就不再随便宰杀牲畜，再加上人民政府下乡收购牧民的土特产，牧畜业也有了很大发展。
