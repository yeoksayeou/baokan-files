    CPPCC National Committee Member
    Sheng Pihua's Speech

    Chairman, fellow committee members, ladies and gentlemen:

    After listening to Vice-Chairman Zhou Enlai's political report, Vice-Chairman Chen Shutong's report on the work of the committee, and Deputy Head Guo Moruo's report on the World People's Peace Congress, I feel extremely excited and pleased. I would like to express my warm approval and support on behalf of the national industrial and commercial circles; and pay the highest tribute to our great leader Chairman Mao.

    For more than three years, under the correct leadership of Chairman Mao, the Chinese Communist Party, and the Central People's Government, our country has made brilliant achievements in politics, economy, culture, and in the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea and defend Asian and world peace. This is worth celebrating. As far as national industry and commerce are concerned, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, difficulties have been continuously overcome, and restoration and transformation have been carried out; the victory of the "Five-Anti" campaign has further promoted the healthy development of national industry and commerce. From this year onwards, our country has begun to enter a great new historical stage. This truly makes us excited and encouraged! We will realize the three great historical tasks of this year—1953—with unparalleled confidence and effort.

    Fellow committee members, today we are going to carry out large-scale national construction. Obviously, the first thing we must do is to continue to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, and achieve greater victories. Only in this way can the Korean issue be resolved peacefully and reasonably; on the other hand, our national construction will be more secure and proceed more smoothly. At the same time, it should be pointed out that carrying out large-scale construction under the condition of continuing to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea is not only possible, but also, because of the large-scale construction, will enhance the material basis for the victory of the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea. The convening of the People's Congress can further promote people's democracy, strengthen national construction and strengthen the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea. This shows that these three great tasks are interrelated. I would also like to point out that these three major tasks are also closely related to national industry and commerce. Taking the resistance to U.S. aggression and aid to Korea as an example, no one can deny that our industry and commerce will be guaranteed due to the victory of the resistance to U.S. aggression and aid to Korea. Taking national construction as an example, today, the most important thing in China's construction is to develop heavy industry; and the development of national heavy industry will inevitably drive the development of light industry and private industry and commerce. As for the convening of the People's Congress and the formulation of the Constitution, this makes us more clearly aware of the status of the national bourgeoisie in the new China.

    Therefore, our national industrialists and businessmen need to work together with the people of the whole country to strive for the victorious realization of these three major tasks of the country!

    First of all, we should continue to implement Chairman Mao's call to the people of the whole country to "increase production and practice thrift to support the Chinese People's Volunteers." After listening to Deputy Head Guo Moruo's report on the World People's Peace Congress, we have a deeper understanding of the need to be vigilant against the U.S. aggressors' conspiracy to expand the war, and to further strengthen the strength to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea. In the rear of the resistance to U.S. aggression and aid to Korea, we must actively support the front line, ensure the sufficient supply of military and civilian materials, promote the spirit of patriotism, earnestly abide by laws and regulations, eliminate the "five poisons", and enthusiastically and honestly pay taxes in a timely manner, so as to further implement Chairman Mao's instructions with concrete actions. And we must assist the government to consolidate the rear, not allow any saboteurs to carry out activities, so that national construction can be carried out smoothly.

    Second, our national industrialists and businessmen will more firmly rely on the working class, under the leadership of the state-owned economy and the state's overall plan, actively improve their business, improve production and management, run factories well, and do a good job in the exchange of materials, so as to better cooperate with the country's construction and meet the needs of the people.

    Third, this year, the national People's Congress system with universal suffrage will be implemented, which is completely timely. In order to welcome the arrival of this great day, national industrialists and businessmen should make all necessary preparations and publicity, and practically participate in this great movement.

    Fourth, in order to implement the above tasks, our national industrialists and businessmen should further strengthen the study of the Common Program and transform their thinking. Since listening to the report of the preparatory representative meeting of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce last year, the national industrialists and businessmen have generally increased their demands for learning. Generally, they are organized to study under the leadership of the learning committees affiliated to the consultation committees of various provinces and cities, and have achieved certain results and experience. After the Constitution is formulated, according to Vice-Chairman Chen Shutong's report, some of the contents of the Common Program will be incorporated into the Constitution, so the Common Program must be appropriately revised. I think this is absolutely necessary. However, the Common Program will still clearly stipulate the common goals of the people of the whole country for further struggle in the future, and will still have a significant role. Therefore, our study of the Common Program should also be strengthened.

    Finally, let us shout: Long live the People's Republic of China! Long live our great leader Chairman Mao!

### 政协全国委员会委员  盛丕华的发言

    政协全国委员会委员
    盛丕华的发言主席、各位委员、各位先生：
    听了周恩来副主席的政治报告，陈叔通副主席的会务报告，及郭沫若副团长关于世界人民和平大会的报告后，感到无限的兴奋和愉快。我谨代表全国工商界表示热烈的赞成与拥护；并向我们伟大的领袖毛主席致最崇高的敬意。
    三年多来，我们的国家在毛主席、中国共产党和中央人民政府正确领导下，在政治、经济、文化等各方面，和在抗美援朝与保卫亚洲及世界和平的斗争中，已经取得了辉煌的成就。这是值得庆贺的。就以全国工商业而论，在毛主席和中央人民政府领导下，不断地克服了困难，进行了恢复与改造；“五反”运动的胜利，更促进全国工商业走向健康发展的道路。从今年起，我们的国家开始进入到一个伟大的新的历史阶段。这真使我们欢欣鼓舞！我们将以无比的信心与努力来实现今年——一九五三年的三项伟大的历史任务。
    各位委员，今天我们要进行国家大规模的建设。很明显的，首先就必须继续进行抗美援朝，并取得更大的胜利。只有这样，一方面朝鲜问题才能得到公正合理的和平解决；另一方面，我们的国家建设才更有保障，才能更顺利地进行。同时应该指出，我们在继续抗美援朝的条件下，进行大规模建设，不仅可能，并且由于大规模建设的进行，更会增强抗美援朝斗争胜利的物质基础。而召开人民代表大会，则可以更加发扬人民民主，加强国家建设和加强抗美援朝的斗争。这就说明了这三项伟大的任务是有相互关系的。我还要说明一点，这三大任务与全国工商业，也是休戚相关的。以抗美援朝而论，谁也不能否认：由于抗美援朝的胜利，我们工商业才会得到保障。再以国家建设而论，今天我国建设，首要的是发展重工业；而国家重工业的发展，必然将带动轻工业和私营工商业的发展。至于人民代表大会的召开，制订宪法，这就使我们更明确地认识了民族资产阶级在新中国的地位。
    因此，我们全国工商业者，更需要和全国人民一道，为胜利地实现国家这三大任务而努力！
    首先，我们应该继续贯彻毛主席向全国人民所提出的“增加生产，厉行节约，以支持中国人民志愿军”的号召。我们听了郭沫若副团长关于世界人民和平大会的报告，更深切地体会到必须对美国侵略者扩大战争的阴谋提高警惕，进一步加强抗美援朝的力量。我们在抗美援朝的后方，必须积极支援前线，保证军需民用物资的充分供应，发扬爱国主义的精神，切实遵守法令，消除五毒，踊跃与诚实地及时纳税，以具体行动来进一步贯彻毛主席的这一指示。并且要协助政府，巩固后方，不让任何破坏分子有所活动，使国家建设得以顺利进行。
    第二，我们全国工商业者，将更坚决依靠工人阶级，在国营经济和国家总的计划领导下，积极搞好业务，改善生产经营，办好工厂，作好物资交流，更好地配合国家的建设，适应人民的需要。
    第三，今年全国将实行普选的人民代表大会制度，这是完全适时的。为了迎接这伟大的日子到来，全国工商业者应作好一切必要的准备和宣传，实际参加到这一伟大的运动中去。
    第四，为了贯彻执行上面的几项任务，我全国工商业者，应进一步加强学习共同纲领，改造思想。全国工商业者，自从去年听了全国工商业联合会筹备代表会议的传达报告后，对学习的要求普遍提高。一般在各省市协商委员会所属的学委会领导下组织起来进行学习，并已获得了一定的成绩与经验。共同纲领在宪法制定后，根据陈叔通副主席的报告，有一部分内容将纳入宪法之中，因而共同纲领须作适当的修改。我认为这是完全必要的。但是共同纲领仍将明确规定全国人民今后进一步斗争的共同目标，仍然具有重大的作用。因此，我们对共同纲领的学习，同样更应该加强。最后，让我们高呼：中华人民共和国万岁！我们伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！
