    The Old Cadre Refresher School of Anshan Iron and Steel Company
    By Our Correspondent Lin Mo
    In order to help cadres transferred from various revolutionary work posts to industrial fields learn technical skills, and gradually transform them from laymen into experts, Anshan Iron and Steel Company established the Old Cadre Refresher School in April 1951. The teaching steps of the refresher school are divided into two stages: the first stage teaches basic scientific knowledge such as mathematics, physics, and chemistry, so that students can reach the level of high school graduation in natural science knowledge. Preliminary technical and professional education is also carried out in this stage; the second stage helps students improve to the level of a university junior college. Currently, this refresher school is conducting the first stage of teaching. Due to the level of the students, teachers, and other objective limitations, courses for university junior colleges have not yet been established. The existing 230+ people studying in the refresher school are all cadres who participated in the revolution before the victory of the Anti-Japanese War and are currently holding positions above the company's section level. They use one and a half hours every morning to study various scientific and technical theoretical knowledge according to their original level.
    The refresher school usually starts classes at 6:30 in the morning (7:00 in the winter). Some diligent people sit in the classroom for self-study at 6:00—sometimes before dawn. During class, those managers, factory directors, division chiefs, and section chiefs sit neatly in the classroom like elementary school students, facing the rising sun shining through the windows, listening quietly and attentively to the teachers' lectures. They temporarily put aside their complicated daily work and focus their minds on mathematical calculations and physical and chemical theorems and laws.
    By December 1952, the refresher school had only been in session for more than 500 hours of actual class time (classes were suspended for several months due to the "Three-Anti" movement and political studies). Many people started from junior high school courses and have already learned courses from the first and second grades of high school. Comrade Ma Bin, the general manager of the company, is one of the best learners. When he first entered the refresher school, he was not very good at the four arithmetic operations. He went to the refresher school in the morning and squeezed out time to study in the evening. After a year and a half, he has learned advanced calculus. His busy work schedule is imaginable, but he has strong perseverance and determination and can strictly control his time. In the evening, sometimes there are visiting guests in his room, but when the scheduled study time arrives, he bids farewell to the guests and says, "I need to study." Sometimes he has to go to Shenyang for a meeting, and the car is waiting at the door, but he still seizes a moment to study in the room, never willing to waste a few minutes. Comrade Ma Bin, like many outstanding members of the Chinese Communist Party, is not only strong and brave in the revolutionary struggle, but also good at learning and advancing in the face of new things in national construction. He was imprisoned by Chiang Kai-shek and led the army in heroic battles against national enemies and class enemies. He learned Russian in the enemy's prison. When he was running around day and night fighting the enemy, his favorite thing was the few books he carried with him. In those days of life-and-death battles, he often considered how to defeat the enemy. As soon as he arrived at the construction post, what he considered was how to master his business and how to attack science and technology. After entering the refresher school, Comrade Ma Bin laid the foundation of general scientific knowledge after more than a year of hard study. Last fall, he was sent to the Soviet Union for further study.
    In Anshan Iron and Steel, many people, like Comrade Ma Bin, try every means to squeeze out time for diligent and hard study. Some factory directors work hard all day, and sometimes have meetings at night, but they never miss the refresher school in the morning. Some people are called away during class due to urgent matters. After the matter is finished, they have to rush back to school to attend class for one or two minutes before the end of the class. Comrade Yang Jinrong, deputy director of the welfare department of the company, still keeps learning in mind during his illness. As soon as he recovered from his illness and was unable to go to work, he rushed to find a teacher to tutor him. Comrade Yang Jinrong only attended elementary school for three years, and he deeply felt that his knowledge level was too far from the cause he was undertaking. He caught up quickly in his studies, reviewing his lessons carefully every night and Sunday. As a result, he skipped two grades in one year and is now in the second grade of high school.
    The reason why many people have such great determination and perseverance in learning is that they have lofty goals and beautiful ideals for their future careers. Comrade Song Dixia, director of the Electrical Repair Factory of Anshan Iron and Steel, did not understand electricity in the past. She is now determined to study and prepare to engage in the electrical business for life. She said: "The Soviet Union's construction of a communist society requires national electrification; our country will also implement electrification in the future. How much work will such a large country like ours need to do!" She enthusiastically talked to me about her ideals for her future career and life. In her mind, it seems that such a picture always appears: the electrical industry surrounds factories and vast green fields, surrounds the beautiful mountains and rivers of the motherland, bringing endless joy and happiness to people. It is this beautiful prospect that constantly encourages her to study hard. She is now studying at the refresher school in the morning, and has also signed a "teaching contract" with an electrical engineer to study technical business every night.
    The reason why many cadres of Anshan Iron and Steel are determined to start learning from basic subjects such as mathematics, physics, and chemistry is because practical experience tells them that it is necessary. When they first entered the factory and were frustrated everywhere, some people were eager to learn technology. At that time, steelmaking training classes and chemical training classes were established, but everyone lacked a foundation of scientific knowledge, and they could not understand what the teachers said, so the training classes soon collapsed. After accepting these lessons, the company's leaders decided to establish the current refresher school.
    The reason why this refresher school has been able to persist after it was established, the reason why the students' confidence in learning has been improving day by day, and the reason why the teaching work has been continuously improved is that the attention and strong support of the leading cadres of Anshan Iron and Steel for this school is an important reason. The school is headed by Jin Tiequn, deputy secretary of the Anshan Municipal Party Committee and deputy manager of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, who is also the principal of the school. He and the director of the company's personnel department are responsible for mobilizing students, transferring teachers, and solving some of the difficulties students encounter in their studies in all aspects. For example, after the approval of the higher authorities, the study time can occupy one hour of working time every day, the school address is located near the students' residence, and special cars are sent to the office location after students leave class. A crisis once occurred one month after the school started: some people lacked confidence in learning, some could not keep up because they missed classes, and many people had opinions on the teaching methods. The teachers were all young students who had just graduated from school, lacking teaching experience, and some were not at ease with their work. At this time, the leading cadres of Anshan Iron and Steel Company explained to the students on the one hand, and mobilized teachers to settle down to teaching and improve teaching methods on the other hand, and gave students supplementary lessons and helped those who had difficulties in learning. Later, the teachers of each class wrote down the phone numbers and addresses of each student. If a student did not come to class, the teacher would call him immediately after class to ask him why he did not come to class and when he could give him a supplementary lesson, and then go to the student's home to give him a supplementary lesson at the agreed time. The teachers' enthusiastic help also prompted the students to be determined to study hard. A few people who wavered in their studies also decided to study hard when they saw the progress of everyone's studies. For example, Comrade Gu Zhengrong, director of the company's welfare department, used to think that he was not directly managing production, and felt that learning mathematics, physics, and chemistry was not very related to his business. He was "fishing for three days and drying nets for two days" in his studies. He wanted to learn but was not determined to do so, and he was perfunctory if he did not learn. Later, he gradually realized that: since he has been working in the industrial sector for a long time, how can he always not understand the problems in production? If you don't understand production and lack scientific knowledge, how can you do a good job in the welfare of employees? Seeing that everyone's knowledge level has improved, wouldn't it be too late to learn now and learn later? After seriously considering these issues, he decided to study hard and make up for the classes he missed in the past. Comrade Liu Kegang, deputy manager of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, said well: "Our knowledge of industry is probably similar, and the era of understanding but not understanding should have passed. The historical task of the country's industrialization is on our shoulders. The Party and the people require us to master our business, master technology, and turn from laymen to experts. But our own culture is poor and our level is very low. Why don't we honestly learn?"
    Editor's note: The spirit of many cadres of Anshan Iron and Steel Company overcoming difficulties and learning culture and business is worthy of encouragement; this is a good example for all cadres who have transferred from various work posts to industrial fields to strive to study their business. This experience should be promoted. But at the same time, we must firmly remember what Comrade An Ziwen pointed out to us in the report "Struggle to Eliminate the Negative and Unhealthy Phenomena in the Party Organization": When "a cadre has already 'drilled into' a certain business, we must pay attention to prevent another tendency, that is, the tendency of 'only asking about business, not about politics'." "The responsibility of the Party's leadership lies in constantly reminding these comrades, sharply opposing all tendencies away from politics, and constantly improving their political level and Marxist-Leninist awareness. Only in this way can we help these comrades truly do their business well." At present, some cadres in Anshan Iron and Steel have begun to have a tendency of "only asking about business, not about politics," which is worthy of timely reminders and attention.

    鞍山钢铁公司的老干部补习学校
    本报记者　林沫
    鞍山钢铁公司为了帮助从各种革命工作岗位转到工业方面来的干部学习技术业务，使他们由外行逐渐变成内行，在一九五一年四月开办了老干部补习学校。补习学校的教学步骤分两个阶段：第一个阶段教授数学、物理、化学等基本科学知识，使学员在自然科学知识方面达到高中毕业程度，在这个阶段同时进行初步的技术业务教育；第二个阶段帮助学员向大学专科的水平提高。目前这个补习学校正在进行第一个阶段的教学，由于学员的程度、教师及其他客观条件的限制，还没有设置大学专科学校的课程。在补习学校学习的现有二百三十多人，都是在抗日战争胜利以前参加革命、现任公司科级以上职务的干部。他们利用每天早上一个半钟头的时间，根据各人原有的程度分别学习各种科学技术理论知识。
    补习学校平常是早晨六点半钟上课（冬季是七点钟上课），有些勤学的人在六点钟——有时天还不大亮——就坐在教室里自习了。上课的时候，那些经理、厂长、处长和科长们，像小学生一样整齐地坐在教室里，迎着射进窗内的初升的阳光，安静地、聚精会神地听教员讲课。他们暂时丢开每天复杂的工作，把心神专注在数学计算和物理、化学的定理、定律上。
    到一九五二年十二月，补习学校实际上课时间不过五百多小时（中间曾因“三反”运动、政治学习停课几个月），有很多人从初中课程学起，已学到高中一、二年级的课程。公司总经理马宾同志就是学习最好的一个。他初进补习学校时，算术四则都不大会。他早晨上补习学校，晚上又挤出时间学习，经过一年半的时间，已学习到高级数学微积分。他工作的繁忙是可以想像出来的，但他有坚强的毅力和决心，能够严格地控制时间。在晚上，有时他房里坐着拜访的客人，规定的学习时间到了，他就向客人告辞说：“我要学习了。”有时他要到沈阳去开会，汽车在门口等着，他还在房里抓紧片刻的时间进行学习，从不肯随便浪费几分钟的时间。马宾同志正如中国共产党许多优秀的党员那样，不单在革命斗争中坚强、勇敢，在国家建设的新事物面前也善于学习，前进。他坐过蒋介石的监牢，带着军队和民族敌人、阶级敌人进行过英勇的战斗。他在敌人的监牢里学习了俄文。在日夜奔走和敌人打仗的时候，他最心爱的是随身带的几本书。在那些出生入死的战斗的日子里，他经常考虑的是如何战胜敌人。一走到建设的岗位上，他所考虑的便是如何精通业务，如何向科学技术进攻了。马宾同志进补习学校以后，经过一年多的苦学，打下了一般科学知识的基础，去年秋季，他已被派赴苏联学习深造。
    在鞍钢，有很多人都像马宾同志那样，想尽一切办法挤出时间，辛勤、刻苦地学习。有的厂长，白天紧张地工作一天，有时夜晚还要开会，但早晨上补习学校却从不缺课。有的人在上课时遇有紧要事情被叫走了，等事情办完，在下课前一、二十分钟，还要赶回学校听课。公司福利处副处长杨金荣同志，在病中还念念不忘学习，他害病刚好，还不能上班工作，就急着找教师给他补习功课。杨金荣同志过去只读过三年小学，他深深感到自己的知识水平距自己所担当的事业相差太远。他在学习中便急起直追，每天晚上和星期天都用心复习功课，结果在一年中连跳了两级，现在已升到高中二年级。
    许多人对学习所以有这样大的决心和毅力，是因为他们有远大的目标，有对未来事业的美好的理想。鞍钢电气修配厂厂长宋迪夏同志过去不懂电气，她现在决心学习，准备终身从事电气事业。她说：“苏联建设共产主义社会，要求全国电气化；我国将来也要实行电气化，像我们这么大一个国家，需要作多少事呀！”她对我热情地谈论着自己对未来的事业和生活的理想。在她的心目中，好像时时显现着这样一幅图画：电气事业环绕着一座座工厂和广大的绿色田野，环绕着祖国美丽的山川与河流，带给人无穷无尽的快乐和幸福。就是这种美好的远景，时时刻刻鼓舞着她努力学习。她现在一面早晨在补习学校学习，一面又和一位电气工程师订了“教学合同”，每天晚上学习技术业务。
    鞍钢的很多干部所以下决心从数学、物理、化学等基本课目学起，是因为现实的经验告诉他们需要如此。当他们初进工厂处处碰壁的时候，有人就急着要学习技术。当时曾成立过炼钢学习班、化工学习班，但大家缺乏科学知识基础，教师讲的听不懂，学习班不久就垮了台。接受了这些教训，公司领导方面才下决心开办现在的补习学校。
    这个补习学校开办以后所以能坚持下来，学员对学习的信心所以能一天天提高，教学工作所以能不断改进，鞍钢领导干部对这个学校的重视和大力支持是一个重要原因。该校由中共鞍山市委副书记、鞍山钢铁公司副经理金铁群兼任校长，他和公司人事处处长负责动员学生，抽调教师，并从各方面解决了学员在学习中的一些困难。如：学习时间经上级批准规定每天可占用工作时间一小时，校址设在学员住地附近，学员下课后派专车送到办公地点。学校开课一个月，曾一度发生危机：有的人对学习缺乏信心，有的因缺了课跟不上，有很多人对教学方法有意见。而教师都是刚从学校出来的青年学生，既缺乏教学经验，有的对工作也不安心。这时，鞍钢领导干部便一面向学员解释，一面动员教师安心教学，改进教学方法，并给学员补课，对学习有困难的人进行帮助。后来，各班教师都记下每个学员的电话号码和住址。那一个学员不来上课，教师下课后就立即给他打电话，问他因为什么不来上课，什么时间可以给他补课，然后就按约定的时间到学生家里去补课。教师们这样热情的帮助，也促使学员们下决心好好学习。少数对学习动摇的人，看到大家学习进步的情形，也下决心要好好学习了。如公司福利处处长谷正荣同志，过去认为自己不直接管理生产，觉得学习数学、物理、化学这些东西和自己的业务关系不大，对学习是“三天打鱼，两天晒网”，想学又不下决心，不学又去应付。后来他逐渐认识到：自己既然长期在工业部门工作，怎么能够永远不懂生产方面的问题？不懂生产，缺乏科学知识，怎么能够作好职工的福利工作？眼看大家的知识水平都提高了，现在自己不学，将来再学岂不更迟了？他认真地考虑了这些问题之后，便下决心好好学，过去缺的课也自己找时间补上了。鞍山钢铁公司副经理刘克刚同志讲得好：“我们对工业大概知道，似懂不懂的时代应该过去了。祖国工业化的历史任务担在我们身上，党和人民要求我们精通业务，掌握技术，由外行变成内行，而我们自己文化贫乏，水准很低，为什么还不老老实实地学呢？”
    编者按：鞍山钢铁公司的许多干部，克服困难，学习文化和业务的精神，是值得鼓励的；这是一切从各种工作岗位上转到工业方面来的干部努力钻研业务的好榜样。这个经验应该加以推广。但在同时，我们必须牢牢记住安子文同志在“为消除党组织内的消极的和不健康的现象而斗争”的报告中所给我们指出的：当“一个干部已经对某种业务‘钻进去’之后，我们就必须注意防止另外一种倾向，这就是‘只问业务，不问政治’的倾向。”“党的领导的责任，就在于不断地提醒这些同志，尖锐地反对一切脱离政治的倾向，不断地提高他们底政治水准和马克思列宁主义觉悟程度，只有这样，才能帮助这些同志真正把他们的业务办好。”目前鞍钢某些干部中开始产生了“只问业务，不问政治”的倾向，这是值得及时提醒，引起警惕的。
