Xinhua News Agency, February 3rd—The All-China Federation of Trade Unions issued instructions to trade unions at all levels across the country, calling for the earnest implementation of the Marriage Law among the broad masses of workers and their families. The instructions pointed out: The work of implementing the Marriage Law by trade union organizations at all levels still suffers from spontaneity; they have failed to conduct planned publicity on the Marriage Law among workers in a serious manner; and they have failed to handle cases of workers whose production is affected by marital disputes in a timely and correct manner in accordance with the spirit of the Marriage Law. If this phenomenon is allowed to continue, it will be detrimental to production. The instructions put forward the following requirements for trade union organizations at all levels:

	1. All levels of trade unions should actively carry out various preparatory tasks for implementing the Marriage Law in factories and mines under the unified leadership of the local Party committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the unified arrangement of the local Marriage Law Implementation Movement Committee. Trade union cadres at all levels must recognize that the Marriage Law Implementation Movement, as long as it is well integrated with the central tasks of factories and mines and properly scheduled, can completely avoid hindering production and will even be beneficial to production.

	2. All levels of trade union cadres, starting with leading cadres, must earnestly study the Marriage Law and important documents related to the Marriage Law, combine this with examining their own thinking and attitudes towards the Marriage Law Implementation Movement, launch criticism and self-criticism to improve their thinking and correct their mistakes.

	3. It is necessary to widely publicize the Marriage Law among workers, staff, and their families. In addition to giving general explanations of the laws themselves, it is essential to be good at using typical people and typical events, especially good examples, to make concrete and comprehensive publicity. Establish various role models among the masses to provide guidance.

	4. Select a group of outstanding male and female workers and family members of employees with a certain level of education and who are activists, based at the grassroots trade union or city level, and provide them with training to prepare a backbone force for the Marriage Law Implementation Movement.

	5. Use all existing propaganda tools of factories and mines and various propaganda organizations of trade unions, and adopt various forms of propaganda, to repeatedly conduct publicity among the masses. Propaganda materials can rely on the masses, be obtained locally, and created jointly with the masses.

    中华全国总工会指示各级工会
    在工人群众及其家属中贯彻执行婚姻法
    【新华社三日讯】中华全国总工会向全国各级工会发出指示，号召在广大工人群众及其家属中，认真贯彻执行婚姻法。指示指出：各级工会组织贯彻执行婚姻法的工作还存在自流现象；未能认真地在工人中有计划地进行婚姻法的宣传；对于工人中因婚姻纠纷而影响生产的事实，还未能按照婚姻法的精神作及时的正确的处理。这种现象，如果让它继续存在下去，对于生产是不利的。指示对各级工会组织提出了下列几点要求：
    一、各级工会应在中共当地党委统一领导和当地贯彻婚姻法运动委员会统一布置下，积极进行厂矿企业中贯彻婚姻法的各项准备工作。各级工会干部必须认识贯彻婚姻法运动，只要与厂矿的中心任务结合得好，时间安排得当，是完全可以不妨碍生产，而且对生产有利的。
    二、各级工会干部，从领导干部开始，必须认真地学习婚姻法和有关婚姻法的重要文件，联系检查自己的思想及对待贯彻婚姻法运动的态度，展开批评与自我批评，以提高思想，纠正错误。
    三、要在工人职员及其家属中，广泛展开婚姻法的宣传。除对法令本身作一般讲解外，要善于通过典型人典型事，尤其要多以好的典型，作具体的和全面的宣传。在群众中树立各种各样的榜样，使群众有所遵循。
    四、以基层工会或市为单位，挑选一批优秀男女工人和职工家属中有一定文化程度的积极分子，施以训练，为贯彻执行婚姻法运动准备骨干。
    五、要利用厂矿一切现有宣传工具，和工会各种宣传组织，采用各种宣传形式，在群众中反复进行宣传。宣传资料，可以依靠群众，就地取材，和群众一起共同创造。
