Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 11th. The people of Shanghai are continuing to vigorously support the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. In many factories, workers are working day and night to produce various materials needed on the Korean front. Many daily necessities manufacturing factories are manufacturing a large number of thirty kinds of daily necessities for the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, such as towels, raincoats, kettles, and mosquito nets. These items are constantly being packed and boxed and shipped to the Korean front. In order to ensure that the raincoats they produce can be used by the Chinese People's Volunteer Army as raincoats when it rains, as tents at night, to isolate moisture in the fortifications, and to sleep on the snow, the workers of the Huafeng Rubber Factory specially apply six layers of glue on two layers of cloth. In the workshops of the Huachang Steel Refinement Factory, tens of thousands of kettles are neatly arranged. Each one is carefully checked by the workers. If they find any pinholes or bubbles on the kettle, they immediately throw the kettle into the furnace to melt it down. Cai Liangen, a fifty-year-old furnace master in the aluminum smelting furnace, brings his meals to the furnace and keeps a close watch on the furnace at all times to ensure that the kettles produced do not have pinholes or bubbles.

    Pharmaceutical factories such as the famous Shanghai Pharmaceutical Equipment Manufacturing Company's Pharmaceutical Factory No. 3 and Kefa Pharmaceutical Factory are manufacturing and dispensing large quantities of drugs such as "Penicillin" for the front. The female workers carefully weigh the white "Penicillin" powder on a scale, then put it into small bottles, and then seal and pack them. Shanghai workers also manufacture a large number of nutritious medicines for the front. The workers of Kefa Pharmaceutical Factory are manufacturing "Multiple Vitamin Pills". Worried that some soldiers might not be used to the taste, the workers turned on the sugar-coating machine, which had not been used for many years, and coated each pill with white sugar. Shanghai Pharmaceutical Equipment Manufacturing Company's Equipment Factory No. 1 has produced many Type A surgical kits for the front. In each kit, the workers carefully arrange hundreds of exquisite knives, scissors, pliers, and other medical instruments to meet the needs of a small field hospital. The workers said: "The weight of this surgical kit is only twenty kilograms. When the Chinese People's Volunteer Army is rapidly advancing to kill the enemy on the front, the field hospital only needs to roll up the surgical kit to keep up."

    The best food manufacturing factories in Shanghai, such as Yimin and Sullivan, have manufactured a large number of exquisite canned food, milk powder, egg powder, candies and biscuits for the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. The State-owned Yimin Food Manufacturing Factory No. 1 had previously shipped canned food, candies, and other foods loaded on four hundred and fifty trucks to the Korean front. Recently, except for children and patients, the people of Shanghai have stopped drinking milk for three days in order to make more milk powder from the saved milk to support the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. As people prepare to celebrate the Spring Festival, the people of Shanghai, like the people of the whole country, are more concerned about the Chinese People's Volunteer Army on the Korean front. The "New Year goods" prepared by Shanghai Native Produce Company, Cooperative General Society, and other units for the Chinese People's Volunteer Army were sent to the Korean front in January. Just the famous Sichuan pickled mustard tuber and Shandong Longkou vermicelli were transported from Shanghai in whole jars and packages, totaling four million jin.

    上海人民继续大力支援志愿军
    工人们日日夜夜生产前线需要的物资
    【新华社上海十一日电】上海人民正在继续大力地支援中国人民志愿军。在许多工厂里，工人们日日夜夜紧张地生产朝鲜前线所需要的各种物资。许多日用品制造工厂，正在为中国人民志愿军制造大量的毛巾、雨披、水壶和蚊帐等三十种日用品，这些物品正不断地成包成箱地运往朝鲜前线。华丰橡胶厂的工人为了要使他们亲手生产出来的雨披，可供中国人民志愿军下雨当雨披，夜里作帐篷，铺在工事里隔潮气，摊在雪地上能睡觉，他们特别精细地在两层布上，上了六层胶。在华昌钢精厂各车间里，整齐地排放着数以万计的水壶，每一只都经过工人们仔细地检查，他们一发现水壶上面有了点砂眼或气泡，马上就把这只水壶投进炉子里溶化掉。炼铝炉的五十岁掌炉老师傅蔡连根把饭带到炉子旁来吃，他一刻不停地看守着炉子，使做出来的水壶不会出现砂眼或气泡。
    我国有名的上海医药器械制造公司药品三厂、科发药厂等制药工厂，正在为前线制造和分装大批的“盘尼西林”等药品。女工们精心地把白色的“盘尼西林”粉末，放在天平上过秤，然后装进一只只小瓶里，再密封、装箱。上海的工人们还制造了大批富于营养的药品供给前方。科发药厂的工人们正在制造“多种维他命丸”。工人们耽心有的战士吃不惯，就把多年来没有开动过的糖衣机转动起来，在每颗丸粒上都包上了白糖衣。上海医药器械制造公司器械一厂，已为前线生产了许多个甲种手术包。每个包里，都由工人们妥善地安排着数百件精制的刀子、剪子、钳子等医疗器械，可供一个小型野战医院的需要。工人们说：“这种手术包的重量只有二十公斤，当中国人民志愿军在前线迅速进军杀敌时，野战医院只要把手术包一卷，就跟上了。”
    上海益民、沙利文等最好的食品制造工厂，为中国人民志愿军制造了大量精美的罐头、奶粉、蛋粉、糖果和饼干。国营益民食品制造第一厂，前些时就有装满四百五十部卡车的罐头和糖果等食品运往朝鲜前线。最近，上海人民除儿童和病人外，都停吃牛奶三天，以便把节省的牛奶制成更多的奶粉，以支持中国人民志愿军。当人们在准备着欢度春节的时候，上海人民和全国人民一样更加关怀着朝鲜前线的中国人民志愿军。上海市土产公司、合作总社等单位为中国人民志愿军办好的“年货”，在一月间就送到朝鲜前线去了。仅我国著名的四川省榨菜和山东省龙口粉丝就整坛整包地由上海运走了四百万斤。
