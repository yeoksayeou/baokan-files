Recently, the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications and the China Postal and Telecommunications Workers' Union led postal and telecommunications departments across the country to conduct a comprehensive and in-depth inspection of the deviations and errors in business operations. They discovered that the most important deviation and error was the use of coercive methods to promote books and magazines, and the use of main force and extremely erroneous methods to carry out so-called "special services," which damaged policies, harmed the interests of the people and national construction, and caused serious damage to the prestige of the Party and the People's Government.

The postal and telecommunications departments' use of compulsory distribution methods to promote books and magazines is a complete violation of the publishing policy of the people's newspapers and periodicals. The requirement for postal and telecommunications departments regarding the distribution of people's newspapers and periodicals is: to be responsible for delivering newspapers and periodicals to readers in a timely and accurate manner, so as to spread revolutionary theory and the policies of the Party and the People's Government to the broad masses. However, the practices of many cadres in the postal and telecommunications departments are the opposite. They simply pursue quantity and do not consider actual results. They force the elderly to subscribe to the "China Children's News," force illiterate people to buy "Study" magazine, and force a factory of 161 people to subscribe to 443 newspapers. In order to achieve the purpose of forcibly promoting books and magazines, they even force recipients to subscribe to newspapers and periodicals, otherwise they will not deliver letters, and "they will never give up until the task is completed." Many people regard them as people who "collect newspaper donations," which shows that the problem is very serious. Because they did not consider the needs of the people when promoting newspapers and periodicals, two intolerable phenomena occurred: First, they concentrated on promoting newspapers and periodicals in areas with convenient transportation, making many people in these areas feel overwhelmed; while in areas with inconvenient transportation, such as many areas in the southwest and northwest, people traveled long distances to post offices to subscribe to newspapers and periodicals, but often could not subscribe. Second, they believe that as long as they develop subscribers, they have completed the task, but they do not study how to deliver newspapers and periodicals well to readers, so that the phenomenon of newspapers and periodicals being late, lost, or missing occurs frequently. A reader in a certain county in Yunnan went to question the post office and said: "Is the post office serving us, or are we serving the post office?" This question is worth serious reflection and inspection by the postal and telecommunications departments.

The postal and telecommunications departments, in order to increase business income, place the focus of their work on so-called "special services," that is, businesses that affect the normal business of the postal and telecommunications departments and increase the burden on the masses. This is a complete violation of the nature and task of the people's postal and telecommunications undertakings. The people's postal and telecommunications undertakings are important tools for national defense construction, economic construction, and cultural construction, and are indispensable means of social connection for the broad masses of people. Therefore, the primary standard for inspecting the work of the postal and telecommunications departments is the extent to which they serve national construction and the quality of service to the people, not other things. However, the so-called "special services" carried out by the postal and telecommunications departments increase its business income by increasing the burden on the masses and weakening the extent to which it serves national construction. For example, unlimited development of purchasing and sales on behalf of others, changing people's ordinary letters into registered letters, changing ordinary long-distance calls into urgent calls, giving priority to sending commercial telegrams with higher fees, and delaying military and political telegrams with lower fees, and so on. In order to achieve this goal, they adopted extremely bad methods of deception and coercion. They promoted "single registration single insurance, double registration double insurance," attempting to make people not send ordinary letters but registered letters. This not only increased the burden and trouble for the masses, but also affected the prestige of the postal and telecommunications departments. They launched the so-called "send one, get one" campaign, that is, if they send a letter to the masses, they must make the masses write a reply. If they remit money to the masses once, they must make the masses buy a newspaper. Therefore, it is not surprising that many people call the post office a "shop yamen."

Some postal and telecommunications staff believe that this is to accumulate funds for the country and complete the task of increasing production and practicing economy. However, this is clearly not related to increasing production and practicing economy. The central task of increasing production and practicing economy in the postal and telecommunications departments, according to the nature of the enterprise and the current situation, should be to strive to improve the quality of work, achieve the requirements of rapid, accurate, convenient, and safe transmission, so as to shorten time limits, eliminate errors, and better serve national construction and the people. If the postal and telecommunications departments can do this, organs, troops, enterprises, and the people will feel that it is their efficient and reliable tool, and will widely use it. In this way, its business will truly develop, and its task of increasing production and practicing economy can be successfully completed. Here, the task of serving national construction and the needs of the people is completely unified with the task of accumulating funds for the country. However, they insist on separating this unified task, they attempt to abandon the task of serving national construction and the needs of the people, and they attempt to unilaterally complete the task of accumulating funds for the country. This will inevitably produce a purely profit-seeking point of view and a purely task-oriented point of view, and lead to the error of coercive command. Because they cannot serve national construction and the needs of the people, they will not receive the support of state organs and the broad masses of people, and if they want to complete the "task," they will inevitably take coercive command methods. A purely task-oriented point of view and a coercive command style are often combined together, and those with a purely task-oriented point of view are bound to commit the error of commandism.

The reason why the postal and telecommunications departments have committed such serious deviations and errors in business operations is inseparable from the bureaucratic work style of the leadership, including the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications. In their leadership work, they often only grasp business leadership, and relax political and ideological education and policy guidance. When they determine the task of increasing production and practicing economy, they neither conduct in-depth investigations and research, nor truly understand the needs and actual situation of the masses, nor mobilize employees to participate in discussions, nor combine the requirements of the higher authorities with the enthusiasm of the broad masses of employees to improve business operations. The task of increasing production and practicing economy determined in this way is of course subjective and not easy to achieve. After they determine this unrealistic task, they neither explain the policy to the lower levels, nor point out the correct methods for completing the task to the lower levels, but simply distribute the task from top to bottom. In the movement to increase production and practice economy, they do not understand the situation at the lower levels, do not conduct inspections, and do not provide specific assistance to the lower levels, but simply sit in the office, waiting for the lower levels' "vigorous" reports and "completion of the task" figures. This practice is actually a kind of connivance and encouragement for the coercive command style of the lower levels. The reason why these errors and deviations in the business operations of the postal and telecommunications departments exist to varying degrees in postal and telecommunications enterprises across the country, and have not been discovered and corrected for a year, is the evil consequence caused by this bureaucratic work style.

Now, after the inspection from top to bottom by the postal and telecommunications departments, deviations and errors have been exposed. We hope that the postal and telecommunications departments will earnestly persist in this inspection movement. However, the errors committed by the postal and telecommunications departments are by no means limited to the postal and telecommunications departments. In other work departments, especially work departments that are directly in contact with the masses, such deviations and errors may also exist. In rural drought prevention and drought resistance work, in bank savings work, in mutual aid and cooperation work, in the patriotic health movement, and in agricultural loan work, we have all found this situation. Many people are divorced from politics, violate policies, do not conduct persuasion and education, but implement coercive commands, so that many good things are turned into bad things. These need to be corrected quickly. Comrade Mao Zedong taught us in the article "Concern for the Life of the Masses, Pay Attention to Working Methods": "We must not only put forward tasks, but also solve the problem of how to complete the tasks. ... All work, if only putting forward tasks without paying attention to the working methods when implementing them, not opposing the bureaucratic working methods but adopting practical and specific working methods, not abandoning the commandist working methods but adopting patient persuasion methods, then no task can be achieved." What Comrade Mao Zedong proposed here is not only a problem of working methods, but also a problem of work style, and also a problem of the mass viewpoint. We must resolutely implement this instruction and raise our work level and leadership level by one step. As long as we truly implement this instruction, we will inevitably be able to improve one step.

### 坚决纠正邮电部门的强迫命令作风

    坚决纠正邮电部门的强迫命令作风
    最近中央邮电部和中国邮电工会领导各地邮电部门，普遍、深入地检查了业务经营中的偏向和错误，发现最重要的偏向和错误是用强迫命令的方法推销书报杂志，并以主要的力量、极端错误的办法开展所谓“特种业务”，以致破坏了政策，损害了人民群众和国家建设的利益，给党和人民政府的威信造成严重的损失。
    邮电部门用强迫摊派的方法推销书报杂志，是完全违反人民报刊的发行方针的。人民报刊的发行工作对于邮电部门的要求是：负责把报纸刊物及时、准确地送到读者手中，以便把革命的理论和党与人民政府的政策传布到广大群众中去。但是，邮电部门的许多干部的作法是与此相反的。他们单纯追求数量，不问实际效果。他们强迫老年人订阅“中国少年报”，强迫文盲购买“学习”杂志，强迫一个一百六十一个人的工厂订阅四百四十三份报纸。为了达到强迫推销书报的目的，他们竟强迫收信人订阅报刊，否则就不给信件，而且“不完成任务永不罢手”。有许多群众把他们看成“收报捐”的人，可见问题是十分严重的了。由于他们推销报刊没有考虑人民的需要，这就发生了两种不能容忍的现象：第一、他们在交通便捷的地区集中推销报刊，使这些地区的许多群众不胜其烦；而在交通不便的地区，如西南、西北许多地区，群众跑许多路到邮局，要求订阅报刊，但是常常订不到。第二、他们认为只要发展了订户，就完成了任务，却不研究怎样把报刊很好地送到读者手中，以致报刊迟到、遗失、错漏的现象层出不穷。云南某县有一位读者去质问邮局说：“究竟是邮局为我们服务，还是我们为邮局服务呢？”这种质问是值得邮电部门认真反省和检查的。
    邮电部门为了增加企业收入，而把工作重点放在所谓“特种业务”，即影响邮电部门的正常业务和增加群众负担的业务上，这是完全违反人民邮电事业的性质和任务的。人民邮电事业是国防建设、经济建设和文化建设的重要工具，是广大人民必不可缺的社会联系的手段。因此，检查邮电部门的工作的首要标准，就是它为国家建设服务的程度和为人民服务的好坏，而不是其他。但邮电部门开展的所谓“特种业务”，却是以增加群众的负担，削弱为国家建设服务的程度的办法，来增加它的企业收入。例如，无限制地发展代购代销业务，把群众的平信改为挂号信，把普通长途电话改为加急电话，尽先拍发收费较高的商用电报，迟发收费较低的军政电报等等。他们为了达到这种目的，采取了极为恶劣的欺骗、强迫的方式。他们宣传“单挂号单保险，双挂号双保险”，企图使群众不寄平信而寄挂号信。这不仅增加了群众的负担和麻烦，而且影响了邮电部门的威信。他们发动了所谓“投一揽一”运动，即给群众送一封信，一定要使群众写一封回信。给群众汇一次款，一定要群众买一份报纸。因此，有许多群众把邮局叫作“商店衙门”，这是毫不足怪的。
    有的邮电工作人员认为这样作是为了给国家积累资金，完成增产节约任务。但是，这显然与增产节约毫不相干。邮电部门的增产节约的中心任务，根据企业的性质和目前的情况，应该是努力提高工作质量，实现传递迅速、准确、方便、安全的要求，以便缩短时限，消灭差错，更好地为国家建设和人民服务。邮电部门如果能够作到这一点，机关、部队、企业、人民就会感觉它是自己的有效率的和可以信赖的工具，就会广泛地运用它。这样，它的业务就会真正发展起来，它的增产节约任务就能顺利完成了。在这里，为国家建设、为人民需要服务的任务和为国家积累资金的任务是完全统一的。但是，他们偏偏把这种统一的任务分割开来，他们企图放弃为国家建设、为人民需要服务的任务，而企图片面地完成为国家积累资金的任务。这就必然产生单纯营利观点和单纯任务观点，发生强迫命令的错误。因为他们既然不能为国家建设、为人民需要服务，他们就得不到国家机关和广大人民的支持，他们要想完成“任务”必然采取强迫命令的办法。单纯任务观点和强迫命令作风经常是结合在一起的，有单纯任务观点的人就必然要犯命令主义的错误。
    邮电部门在业务经营中所以发生了这样严重的偏向和错误，是跟领导方面，包括中央邮电部的官僚主义作风分不开的。他们在领导工作中，常常只抓住业务领导，而放松了政治思想教育和政策指导。他们确定增产节约任务的时候，既没有进行深入的调查研究，没有真正了解群众的需要和实际情况，又没有发动职工参加讨论，没有把上级的要求和广大职工改进业务工作的热情结合起来。这样确定的增产节约任务当然是主观主义的，不容易实现的。他们确定了这种不切合实际的任务以后，既不向下级交代政策，又不给下级指出完成任务的正确方法，只是把任务自上而下地分摊下去。在增产节约运动中，他们不了解下情，不进行检查，不给下级以具体帮助，只是坐在办公室里，等待下级的“轰轰烈烈”的报告和“完成任务”的数目字。这种作法，对于下级的强迫命令的作风，实际上是一种纵容和鼓励。邮电部门在业务经营中发生的这些错误和偏向，所以程度不同地存在于全国的邮电企业中，而且持续一年没有被发现和纠正，就是这种官僚主义作风所造成的恶果。
    现在，经过了邮电部门自上而下的检查，偏向和错误已经被揭发出来了。我们希望邮电部门把这个检查运动认真坚持下去。但是，邮电部门所犯的这些错误，决不止限于邮电部门。在其他工作部门，特别是直接和群众联系的工作部门，都可能同样存在着这样的偏向和错误。在农村的防旱抗旱工作中，在银行的储蓄工作中，在互助合作工作中，在爱国卫生运动中，在农贷工作中，我们都曾发现这种情形。许多人脱离政治，违反政策，不进行说服教育，而实行强迫命令，以致把许多好事办成坏事。这些都需要迅速加以纠正。毛泽东同志在“关心群众生活，注意工作方法”一文中教导我们说：“我们不但要提出任务，而且要解决完成任务的方法问题。……一切工作，如果仅仅提出任务而不注意实行时候的工作方法，不反对官僚主义的工作方法而采取实际具体的工作方法，不抛弃命令主义的工作方法而采取耐心说服的方法，那末，什么任务也是不能实现的。”毛泽东同志在这里所提出的，不但是工作方法问题，也是工作作风问题，也是群众观点问题。我们必须坚决执行这一指示，把我们的工作水平和领导水平提高一步。我们只要真正执行了这一指示，就必然能够提高一步。
