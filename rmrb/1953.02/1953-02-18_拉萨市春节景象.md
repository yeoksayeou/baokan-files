    Spring Festival Scenes in Lhasa
    The Tibetan people of Lhasa and the soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Tibet Military Region stationed in Lhasa celebrated the Tibetan New Year of 1953 together.
    On New Year's Eve, the streets and alleys of Lhasa were swept clean, and every household sprinkled white lime with various patterns symbolizing auspiciousness in front of their doors. From Jokhang Temple to Barkhor Street, the newly installed street lights shone brightly; the electric lights installed on the Princess Willow tree in front of Jokhang Temple radiated festive light. The tens of thousands of butter lamps in the Jokhang Temple were filled with new oil. The Potala Palace held its traditional grand Cham dance on New Year's Eve. Zhang Jingwu, representative of the Central People's Government, and Tan Guansan, political commissar of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Tibet Military Region, went to the Potala Palace to wish the Dalai Lama a happy Spring Festival.
    Before dawn on Spring Festival, citizens went to the Lhasa River to fetch water (this water symbolizes auspiciousness for the year). In the early morning, monks from various temples chanted Buddhist scriptures in unison. Officials of the Tibetan local government rode horses to the Potala Palace to pay New Year's greetings to the Dalai Lama. People from Xikang, Qinghai, and northern Tibet's Qiangtang who came to Lhasa to worship Buddha lit lamps and prayed in the Jokhang Temple.
    When the sun began to shine on the Lhasa Plain, all the activities for celebrating the Spring Festival began. Groups of Tibetan people, leading children, wearing brightly colored Tang Dynasty decorations, singing Tibetan songs and operas, and shaking copper bells, strolled through the streets. The appearance of the Yangko teams from the Tibet Military Region troops and various agencies on the streets added to the festive atmosphere. Citizens eagerly watched the large New Year pictures and wall newspapers posted on the streets.
    At noon, a Spring Festival military-civilian get-together was held in the square in front of the Potala Palace. The various cultural and artistic troupes of the Tibet Military Region performed songs, dances, and skits for the citizens in Tibetan. At the get-together, a telegram sent from the mainland by Tsering Dolma, the Tibetan representative of the Chinese delegation participating in the Vienna World People's Peace Congress, was broadcast over loudspeakers, recounting her experience of participating in the congress and the important significance of the congress. In addition, the full text of the broadcast to the Tibetan people by Liu Xia·Tudeng Taba, head of the Tibet tribute delegation, on the Central People's Broadcasting Station was broadcast.
    On this day, cadres and soldiers of the Tibet Military Region organs and troops exchanged New Year's greetings with the Tibetan people, wishing each other "Tashi Delek" (meaning "auspicious Spring Festival" in Tibetan). The Tibetan people treated the People's Liberation Army soldiers with their best festive food. All the Tibetan teachers of the cadre school of the Tibet Military Region collectively paid New Year's greetings to General Zhang Jingwu, General Tan Guansan, and the leaders of the military region.
    At night, the magnificent lights in the city's buildings illuminated the streets, children wearing new clothes danced youth dances on the streets, movies were shown in the square, lively New Year's Eve parties were held in many courtyards, and bursts of Tibetan songs could be heard from the distant Linka.

    拉萨市春节景象
    西藏拉萨市的藏族人民和中国人民解放军西藏军区驻拉萨部队的战士们，一起欢度了一九五三年的藏历春节。
    除夕，拉萨市的大街小巷打扫得干干净净，每家门前都用白石灰撒上了象征吉祥的各种图案。从大昭寺到八角街一带，新装置的路灯大放光明；安装在大昭寺门前公主柳树上的电灯，放射着节日的光彩。大昭寺内的万盏酥油铜灯，已经上满了新油。布达拉宫在除夕照例举行了盛大的跳神会。中央人民政府代表张经武将军、中国人民解放军西藏军区政治委员谭冠三将军到布达拉宫向达赖喇嘛祝贺春节。
    春节黎明前，市民们纷纷到拉萨河里去背水（这些水象征一年的吉祥）。清晨，各寺庙僧众齐诵佛号。西藏地方政府官员，骑马到布达拉宫向达赖喇嘛拜年。从西康、青海和藏北羌塘到拉萨来朝佛的人们在大昭寺内点灯朝拜。
    当太阳开始照耀着拉萨平原的时候，欢度春节的一切活动开始了。成群结队的藏族人民拉着孩子，穿着颜色鲜艳的唐代装饰，唱着藏曲和藏戏，摇着铜铃，在大街上逛游。西藏军区部队和各机关的秧歌队在街头出现时，更增加了节日的欢乐景象。市民们争看贴在街头的大幅年画和墙报。
    中午，在布达拉宫前面的广场上举行春节军民联欢大会，西藏军区各文艺工作团用藏语向市民们表演了歌舞和短剧。在联欢大会上还用扩音器转播了参加维也纳世界人民和平大会的中国代表团西藏代表泽仁卓玛从内地寄来的通讯，这篇通讯叙述了她参加大会的经过和大会的重要意义。另外还转播了西藏致敬团团长柳霞·土登塔巴在中央人民广播电台向西藏人民的广播全文。
    这天，西藏军区机关部队的干部、战士们和藏族人民互相拜年，见面时互祝“扎喜得勒”（春节吉利的意思），藏族人民用他们最好的节日食品招待解放军战士。西藏军区干部学校的全体藏族教员集体向张经武将军、谭冠三将军和军区首长拜年。
    入夜，市区楼房里辉煌的灯火照亮了大街，穿着新衣的孩子们在街头跳青年舞，广场上放映着电影，许多院落里热烈地举行年节晚会，远处的林卡里传来阵阵的藏曲歌声。
