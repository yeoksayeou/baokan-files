Xinhua News Agency, London, February 7th: The Burmese government notified the British government in January of this year, requesting the abolition of the Anglo-Burmese military agreement. The term of this agreement will expire at the end of this year.

According to this agreement, Britain sent a military delegation to Burma to train the Burmese army. Burma guaranteed that it would not receive military delegations from countries other than the British Empire. Britain guaranteed to provide the Burmese government with all conveniences for purchasing military supplies. The Anglo-Burmese military agreement restricted the opportunity for the US government to interfere in Burma's internal affairs and hindered the shipment of US arms to Burma.

Recently, negotiations on the United States transporting a large amount of military supplies to Burma are underway in Rangoon. US Ambassador to Burma, Mr. Sebald, and Burmese Army Chief of Staff, Lieutenant General Bo Ni Wun, discussed the details last weekend.

The British government is also trying its best to maintain its position in Burma and prevent the Americans from establishing influence there. It is now known that the head of the British military delegation in Burma, Mr. Ward, has received instructions from London and is negotiating with Bo Ni Wun on the conclusion of a new Anglo-Burmese military agreement.

    英国阻止美国势力进入缅甸
    【新华社十二日讯】据塔斯社伦敦七日讯：缅甸政府在今年一月间通知英国政府要求废除英缅军事协定。这个协定的期限将在今年年底届满。
    根据这个协定，英国派了一个军事代表团驻在缅甸，从事训练缅甸军队。缅甸保证除了英帝国以外不接待其他国家的军事代表团。英国保证提供缅甸政府以购买军事物资的一切便利。英缅军事协定使美国政府干涉缅甸内政的机会受到了限制并且使美国军火输往缅甸受到了障碍。
    最近，关于美国以大量军火运往缅甸的谈判正在仰光进行。美国驻缅甸大使赛鲍尔和缅甸军总司令波尼温中将已在上周周末讨论了细节。
    英国政府方面也在竭力维持它在缅甸的地位并且阻止美国人在那里树立势力。现已获悉，英国驻缅甸军事代表团团长华德奉了伦敦方面的训令，正在和波尼温就缔结新的英缅军事协定一事进行谈判。
