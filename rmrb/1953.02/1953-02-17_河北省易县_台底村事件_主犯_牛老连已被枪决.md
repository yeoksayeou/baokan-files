Hebei Province, Yi County “Taidi Village Incident” Main Culprit
Niu Laolian, Executed by Firing Squad

The Yi County People's Government of Hebei Province held a mass rally on February 7th and executed Niu Laolian, the local tyrant of Taidi Village, by firing squad (for the facts of his crimes, see "The Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China Handles Two Typical Cases" on the front page of this newspaper on February 7th and "The Course of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China Handling the 'Taidi Village Incident'" on page 3 on February 8th). On this day, representatives selected from more than two hundred villages, along with more than five thousand people from nearby villages, personally witnessed the local tyrant Niu Laolian falling before the law, and unanimously applauded. Chen Pingquan, a representative of the people of Taidi Village, said happily: "When I came, the villagers repeatedly told me to ask the government to execute Niu Laolian. The government has done it! When I go back, I will definitely tell everyone to engage in production properly, support the People's Government, and actively assist the government in carrying out the struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline." Other representatives and the masses also discussed: "The People's Government is really standing up for the people." "Today is the people's world, and bad elements can no longer be allowed to dominate." "We must respond to the government's call to consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship." Sun Yurui, an old lady from Mawuzhuang, hated Niu Laolian's actions very much. She gnashed her teeth and said: "Such a bad guy should be shot. I thank the People's Government for eliminating a great scourge for the people!" Zheng Laoqing, who is over sixty years old, said: "Under the rule of the Kuomintang, bad people could run wild and no one dared to care; in the people's world, it is absolutely not allowed." Many people expressed: supporting the People's Government, and in the future, they will actively participate in the struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline. Wang Jinzhong, the county magistrate of Yi County People's Government, spoke on the spot, calling on the people of the county to boldly expose bad people and bad deeds, supervise cadres at all levels, and the People's Government will definitely stand up for the people.

    河北省易县“台底村事件”主犯
    牛老连已被枪决
    河北省易县人民政府在二月七日召开群众大会，枪决台底村恶霸分子牛老连（其罪恶事实见二月七日本报第一版“中共河北省委处理两个典型案件”及二月八日第三版“中共河北省委处理‘台底村事件’的经过”两文）。这天，二百多村庄选派的代表，连同附近村庄的五千多人亲眼看到恶霸分子牛老连在国法面前倒下去之后，一致拍手称快。台底村人民代表陈平全高兴地说：“我来时，乡亲们一再嘱咐我，要求政府枪毙牛老连。政府办到了！我回去后，一定告诉大家好好生产，拥护人民政府，积极协助政府开展反对官僚主义、反对命令主义、反对违法乱纪的斗争。其他代表和群众，也都纷纷议论：“人民政府真正是给人民撑腰。”“今天是人民的天下，不能再让坏分子称王称霸了。”“要响应政府号召，巩固人民民主专政。”麻屋庄的孙玉瑞老大娘，对牛老连的所作所为，十分痛恨，她咬牙切齿地说：“这样的坏家伙正应该枪毙。我感谢人民政府给人民除了大害！”六十多岁的郑老庆说：“在国民党统治下，坏人可以胡作非为，没人敢管；在人民的天下，是绝不能容许的。”很多人表示：拥护人民政府，今后要积极参加反对官僚主义、反对命令主义、反对违法乱纪的斗争。易县人民政府县长王尽忠当场讲话，号召全县人民大胆检举坏人坏事，监督各级干部，人民政府一定给人民作主。
