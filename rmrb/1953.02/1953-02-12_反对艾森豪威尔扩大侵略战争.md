    Oppose Eisenhower's Expansion of the War of Aggression
    CPUSA Chairman Foster Calls on the American People to Stop Eisenhower's Adventurous Expansion of the War
    [Xinhua News Agency, Prague, February 11th] CPUSA National Committee Chairman William Z. Foster published an article in the New York "Worker's Daily" weekly on February 8th, stating that Eisenhower's bellicose State of the Union address puts the American people at risk of expanding the war in Asia.

    Foster pointed out that the entire American plan to aid Chiang Kai-shek in attacking China goes against the will of the American people. "American military leaders know that if the American people had a choice, they would never agree to such a disastrous adventure."

    Foster recounted that Truman took the initial series of major steps towards war without prior consent from the US Congress or the United Nations, and now Eisenhower intends to complete this process. Foster said: "These arbitrary actions taken by these two American presidents demonstrate how frantically the war-mongers are struggling to avoid a brewing economic crisis; how those on Wall Street who intend to conquer the world are willing to take risks, implement fascism, and launch wars."

    Foster continued by saying that it is therefore extremely important for the masses of the people to firmly demand an immediate ceasefire in Korea. This is the people's way of fighting for peace against the war-mongers' plans to expand the war.

    Foster pointed out, "Anyone who thinks that expanding the war will help solve the prisoner-of-war issue that has stalled the Panmunjom armistice negotiations is delusional. On the contrary, only an immediate ceasefire in Korea can achieve peace. In this way, the prisoner-of-war issue will be resolved, while the result of expanding the war can only be an endless increase in casualties and prisoners of war."

    Foster believes it was extremely foolish for the United Nations to pass the Indian proposal, rejecting the suggestion of an immediate ceasefire while continuing to seek a solution to the prisoner-of-war issue. He said: The only reason the United Nations did this is that Wall Street's warmongers want to continue and expand the war. When the United Nations reconvenes this month, the question will once again be clearly raised – ceasefire or expanded war. Given that Wall Street's spokesmen will do everything possible to obstruct the United Nations from passing the people's peace plan – the plan for an immediate ceasefire in Korea, Foster called on organized workers, black people, every people's organization, and all Americans to demand an immediate ceasefire at this critical juncture, which will lay the foundation for world peace.
    
    Progressive Party Secretary Baldwin Opposes Sending American Youth to Die in Korea
    According to a report in the "Worker's Daily" on the 6th, Progressive Party Secretary Baldwin also condemned Eisenhower's decision regarding Taiwan, accusing him of betraying the hopes of millions of Americans who elected him president because he promised to end the Korean War.

    Baldwin said: "We appeal to all Americans, regardless of their party affiliation, to immediately write to President Eisenhower and demand that he stop sending American youth to die in Korea or supporting Chiang Kai-shek's suicidal policy of attacking the Chinese coast."

    All-India Peace Council Secretary-General Chandra Firmly Protests Eisenhower's Expansion of the War
    [Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, February 11th] All-India Peace Council Secretary-General Chandra issued a statement on the 7th condemning Eisenhower's announcement to use the Kuomintang remnants as a tool for expanding aggressive adventures.

    The statement said: "The All-India Peace Council appeals to all men and women who hope to prevent a third world war to lodge a firm protest against the dangerous policies formulated by the US President. The people of India want the Korean War to end and an immediate ceasefire."

    The statement pointed out that even those who have close ties with the US government until now have expressed disapproval of Eisenhower's actions to use the Kuomintang remnants. Because there is almost unanimous condemnation of Eisenhower's attempt to "use Asians to fight Asians," we believe that peace can still be saved.

    The statement said: "The All-India Peace Council urges the Indian government to warn Washington that any attempt by the Kuomintang army, trained and equipped by the United States, to attack the Chinese mainland will be regarded by the Indian people as an act of aggression by the United States of America."

    The statement concluded by calling on all peace committees and organizations, groups, and individuals dedicated to the cause of peace to organize the broadest possible movement to oppose the expansion of the war and strive for an immediate ceasefire in Korea.

    反对艾森豪威尔扩大侵略战争
    美共主席福斯特号召美国人民制止艾森豪威尔冒险扩大战争
    【新华社布拉格十一日电】美国共产党全国委员会主席福斯特二月八日在纽约“工人日报”星期刊上发表文章说，艾森豪威尔的好战的国情咨文使美国人民面临在亚洲扩大战争的危险。
    福斯特指出，美国援助蒋介石进攻中国的整个计划是违背美国人民意志的。“美国军事首脑们知道，美国人民如果有选择的机会的话，是绝不会同意这种造成灾难的冒险的。”
    福斯特追述，杜鲁门没有事先得到美国国会或联合国同意便采取了最初一系列走向战争的重大步骤，现在艾森豪威尔打算完成这个过程。福斯特说：“这两个美国总统所采取的这种专断的行动说明了，为了避免酝酿中的经济危机，战争贩子是如何疯狂挣扎；华尔街那些打算征服世界的人们是如何不惜挺而走险，实行法西斯主义，发动战争。”
    福斯特接着说，因此，人民群众坚决要求在朝鲜立即停战是极其重要的。这是人民针对着战争贩子们扩大战争的计划争取和平的办法。
    福斯特指出，“谁要是认为扩大战争对解决使板门店停战谈判陷于停顿的战俘问题会有所帮助，那真是痴想。相反地，只有在朝鲜立即停战才能达到和平。这样，战俘问题将会得到解决，而扩大战争的结果便只能是无止境地增加伤亡与战俘而已。”
    福斯特认为联合国通过印度提案，拒绝了一面继续设法解决战俘问题一面立即停战的建议，是极其愚蠢的。他说：联合国之所以这样做，其唯一的原因是，华尔街的黩武主义者们希望继续并扩大战争。当联合国于本月间再次开会时，问题将再一次明显地提出来——停战还是扩大战争。鉴于华尔街的代言人将无所不用其极地阻挠联合国通过人民的和平计划——在朝鲜立即停战的计划，福斯特号召有组织的工人、黑人、每一个人民团体以及全美国人民，在这个决定性的关头要求立即停战，这将为世界和平打下基础。
    美国进步党书记鲍德温反对把美国青年派到朝鲜送死
    据“工人日报”六日报道，美国进步党书记鲍德温也斥责艾森豪威尔关于台湾的决定，指责他这种行动辜负了千千万万美国人民的希望，美国人民所以选他当总统，是因为他许下了结束朝鲜战争的诺言。
    鲍德温说：“我们向一切美国人呼吁，不管他们属于那一个政党，立刻写信给艾森豪威尔总统，要求他停止把美国青年派到朝鲜去送死或支持蒋介石进攻中国海岸的自杀政策。”
    全印和平理事会秘书长钱德拉坚决抗议艾森豪威尔扩大战争
    【新华社新德里十一日电】全印和平理事会秘书长钱德拉在七日发表声明，谴责艾森豪威尔宣布利用国民党残余匪帮作为扩大侵略冒险的工具。
    声明说：“全印和平理事会向一切希望防止第三次大战的男女呼吁，要对美国总统所拟订的危险政策提出坚决的抗议。印度人民希望朝鲜战争结束和立即停火。”
    声明指出：甚至一直到现在还和美国政府有密切联系的人，都表示不赞成艾森豪威尔利用国民党残余匪帮的行动。因为几乎是大家一致在谴责艾森豪威尔的“用亚洲人打亚洲人”的企图，我们相信和平还是可以拯救的。
    声明说：“全印和平理事会敦促印度政府警告华盛顿：由美国训练和装备的国民党军进攻中国大陆的任何企图，都将被印度人民认为是美利坚合众国的一种侵略行动。”
    声明最后号召所有的和平委员会以及致力于和平事业的组织、团体和个人，组织最广泛的运动，反对扩大战争，争取立即在朝鲜停火。
