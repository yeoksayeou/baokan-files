Xinhua News Agency, February 25th: The North China Region's Marriage Law Implementation Committee recently held an enlarged meeting. Zhang Panshi, the chairman of the committee, delivered a report on how to carry out the Marriage Law implementation movement. After describing the preparations for the Marriage Law implementation movement in various parts of North China, the report focused on criticizing the impatience shown by some cadres in the initial work. Zhang Panshi said: Some people fantasize about solving all family or marriage problems in this movement, and are not good at grasping the universal and essential major problems for in-depth publicity and education, which must be corrected. He pointed out: It is necessary to distinguish different regions to grasp the development of the movement. The old liberated areas have basically implemented the Marriage Law; in the newly liberated areas, the feudal marriage system still dominates, and young people are not very willing to fight for freedom of marriage; in the semi-old liberated areas, the struggle between the new and old marriage systems is tit-for-tat. Therefore, the leadership should be more cautious in grasping the movement in the latter type of areas.

When talking about the content of the movement, which is to publicize the Marriage Law on a large scale and check the implementation of the Marriage Law, Zhang Panshi emphasized: In the movement, we should persuade and educate the masses, not scare people. We must be good at inspiring the masses to carry out self-education, and not adopt inappropriate methods such as bitterness meetings, confession and struggle meetings, and household-by-household comparisons. It is necessary to make everyone involved in this movement understand that the purpose of the movement is precisely to achieve democracy, equality, harmony between families and couples, which is conducive to production and benefits future generations, and it is by no means to make families and couples quarrel and add sorrow. As for checking the implementation of the Marriage Law, it is mainly aimed at cadres; among the general people, only after full publicity and education will their reflections be heard, so as to continue publicity and education.

Zhang Panshi emphasized: This Marriage Law implementation movement must be steady, but steadiness does not mean relaxation. It is necessary to prevent any chaotic phenomena, and also to prevent the occurrence of unbalanced movement development due to perfunctory and formalistic approaches. The report finally requested that in the vast rural areas of the region, preparations for the movement should continue to be stepped up to meet the climax of the movement after "March 8th" (International Women's Day).

During the discussion, the meeting unanimously agreed with Zhang Panshi's report and provided many typical experiences in implementing the Marriage Law. These experiences all show that the Marriage Law implementation movement is a process of repeatedly and deeply educating the masses on marriage policies and mobilizing the masses to carry out self-education. In addition, the meeting discussed how cadres at all levels should conduct marriage policy education, how factories and mines should carry out the Marriage Law implementation movement, and issues such as the marriages of military dependents.

Finally, Zhang Panshi, the director, made a summary of the meeting. He explained that in the leadership of the movement, it is necessary to understand the essence of this movement as a democratic reform within the people, and to recognize that the implementation of the Marriage Law is a long-term matter. Therefore, the enthusiasm of cadres must be guided to the work of conducting publicity and education to the masses. The central link of strengthening leadership is to unify the understanding of cadres at all levels, especially cadres at the county, district, and village levels. For this reason, it is necessary to train cadres and explain policies to them, which is a guarantee for the healthy development of the movement.

    华北区贯彻婚姻法运动委员会举行扩大会议
    批判急躁情绪强调进行深入宣传教育
    【新华社二十五日讯】华北区贯彻婚姻法运动委员会在最近举行扩大会议，张磐石主任委员在会上作了如何进行贯彻婚姻法运动的报告。报告在叙述了华北各地进行贯彻婚姻法运动的准备工作情况后，着重批判了在初步工作中某些干部暴露出的急躁情绪。张磐石说：有些人幻想在这一运动中解决一切家庭或婚姻问题，不善于抓住带有普遍性的而又是本质的主要问题进行深入的宣传教育，这必须加以纠正。他指出：应该区别不同地区掌握运动的发展，老区已基本上贯彻了婚姻法；而在新区，封建婚姻制度仍占优势，青年还不大敢进行争取婚姻自由的斗争；在半老区，新旧婚姻制度的斗争针锋相对，因而领导方面对后一种地区的运动要更加慎重掌握。
    张磐石在谈到运动的内容是大规模地宣传婚姻法和检查婚姻法执行情况时，着重指出：在运动中应说服教育群众，不应吓唬人；要善于启发群众进行自我教育，不能采取诉苦运动、坦白斗争大会、家家户户评比等不适当的作法。必须使每一参与这一运动的人了解：运动的目的正是为了达到家庭、夫妇之间的民主、平等、和睦，有利生产，造福儿孙，绝不是使家庭、夫妇之间闹蹩扭、添愁苦。至于检查婚姻法执行情况，主要是对干部；在一般人民群众中，只是在充分宣传教育后听取他们的反映，以便继续进行宣传教育。
    张磐石强调指出：这次贯彻婚姻法运动一定要稳，但稳并不是放松。既要防止任何混乱现象，也要防止因草率从事、形式主义而造成运动发展不平衡的情形发生。报告最后要求：在全区广大农村中，要继续加紧运动的准备工作，以迎接“三八节”后的运动高潮。
    会议在讨论中一致同意张磐石的报告，并提供了不少贯彻婚姻法的典型经验。这些经验都说明：贯彻婚姻法运动就是向群众反复深入地进行婚姻政策的教育并发动群众进行自我教育的过程。此外，会议对各级机关干部如何进行婚姻政策教育，工厂、矿山如何开展贯彻婚姻法运动及军属婚姻等问题，都作了讨论。
    会议最后由张磐石主任作总结。他说明在运动的领导上，必须体会这一运动是人民内部的民主改革的本质，认清贯彻婚姻法是长期的事，因此必须把干部的积极性引导到向群众进行宣传教育的工作中去。加强领导的中心环节，是把各级干部特别是县、区、村三级干部的认识统一起来，为此必须训练好干部，向他们交代政策，这是运动健康发展的保证。
