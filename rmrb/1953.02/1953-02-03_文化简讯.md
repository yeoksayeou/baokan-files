　　Xinjiang Achieves Success in Training Healthcare Workers of All Nationalities Over the Past Three Years
　　In the past three years, Xinjiang Province has trained a large number of healthcare workers from minority nationalities, which has led to the rapid development of the province's healthcare cause.
　　Before liberation, Xinjiang had very few healthcare workers, and the vast rural and pastoral areas generally lacked healthcare workers and medical institutions. As a result, many people of all nationalities suffered from illnesses, and the population mortality rate was very high. After liberation, the People's Government adopted various measures to vigorously train healthcare workers from all nationalities. In the past three years, it has trained more than 830 medical personnel, trained and reformed more than 1,980 midwives and old-style midwives, and trained more than 13,000 health workers in the vast rural and pastoral areas.
    As a large number of healthcare workers from all nationalities have been trained, the face of Xinjiang's healthcare cause has undergone great changes. In the past three years, Xinjiang Province has not only replenished the original healthcare institutions, but also built 51 new healthcare institutions, so that all ten special districts and 79 counties in Xinjiang have hospitals or health center organizations; and 21 districts have established people's medical and health stations. In addition, 88 maternal and child health stations and more than 220 midwifery stations have been established throughout the province. In the past three years, about 1,470,000 people in Xinjiang have received treatment, and more than 3,264,000 people have been vaccinated against smallpox. Infant mortality rates have gradually decreased in various places.

    新疆三年来培养各民族卫生工作人员有成绩
    新疆省各地三年来培养了大批少数民族的卫生工作人员，使全省的卫生事业获得迅速发展。
    新疆各地在解放前，卫生工作人员极少，广大的农村和牧区，普遍缺乏卫生工作人员和卫生医疗机构，因而各族人民患病的很多，人口死亡率很高。解放后，人民政府采取各种办法大力培养各民族的卫生工作人员，三年来，已培养了八百三十多名医务工作人员，训练和改造了一千九百八十多名助产人员和旧产婆，并在广大农村和牧区，培养了一万三千多名卫生员。  由于各民族的卫生工作人员已大量培养出来，新疆各地的卫生事业面貌就起了很大变化。三年来，新疆省不仅充实了原有的卫生医疗机构，并且新建了五十一个卫生医疗机构，使新疆十个专区和七十九个县普遍有了医院或卫生所的组织；并有二十一个区成立了人民医疗卫生站。此外，各地还成立了八十八个妇幼保健站和二百二十多个接生站。三年来新疆约有一百四十七万多人受到诊治，三百二十六万四千多人接种了牛痘。各地婴儿死亡率已逐渐降低。
