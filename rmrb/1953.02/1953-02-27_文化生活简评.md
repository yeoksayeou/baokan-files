Cultural Life Commentary

    Learn from the Noble Qualities of Model People's Teacher Shi Xinmin

    The story of Shi Xinmin, a teacher at Bao Village Central Elementary School in Jing County, Anhui Province, who loved children and sacrificed himself to save them in danger, shows that he was a trustworthy educator of our country and people. His spirit of high responsibility for his work is worthy of emulation by teachers across the country.

    Shi Xinmin loved children. In order to reform unruly children, he cared for their studies with the heart of a mother, and extended his educational efforts to all aspects of the children's lives, finally achieving great success. This is an excellent lesson for those teachers who use various forms of corporal punishment or disguised corporal punishment to "control" children, and for those teachers who insist on the fallacy of "spare the rod and spoil the child."

    Shi Xinmin was also consistently responsible in his daily work. He escorted his students home every day, rain or shine. He either led his students or followed closely behind them, always urging them to "walk carefully." Until he jumped into the river to rescue a child who had fallen into the water and was being swept away by the flood, he kept shouting, "Save the children! Save the children!" Not only that, but he was also brave enough to criticize himself and able to criticize the shortcomings of others with a kind attitude. His purpose was to improve the overall teaching work. This cannot but be a mirror for those teachers who lack a sense of responsibility for their work, or who only approach their work with an attitude of "just going through the motions."

    Shi Xinmin's qualities are noble. The reason why he was able to possess such noble qualities was certainly due to the education and cultivation of the Party and the People's Government; but it was also due to his personal willingness to learn humbly and work hard to transform himself. Only in this way can we imagine that Shi Xinmin, an intellectual youth from a rich peasant family, could deeply understand the nature and responsibility of his work, and be loyal to his duty, fulfilling the trust placed in him by the motherland and the people.

    Shi Xinmin's sacrifice is sad, because it is a great loss to the people's education cause. But his sacrifice is glorious, and his actions are worthy of being an example for people. Therefore, he deserves the title of "Model People's Teacher."

    Teachers across the country should learn well from Shi Xinmin's exemplary deeds. In particular, those teachers who believe that the great work of educating the next generation of the motherland is "eating chalk dust and drawing red circles for the rest of their lives, and arguing with children all day long, with no future"; or those teachers who have made mistakes of abusing and insulting children, should seriously examine their own thoughts and work, and bravely criticize their own shortcomings and mistakes, so as to correct their work attitude, change their work style, and further transform themselves.

    "Talks on Democratic Construction and Administration" Commits the Error of Advocating Old Bourgeois Election Views

    The book "Talks on Democratic Construction and Administration," published by Hunan Popular Reading Materials Publishing House in November 1952, uses the bourgeois viewpoint to discuss the people's congress system of universal suffrage, seriously distorting the democratic essence of universal suffrage under the New Democratic system. When discussing "why people's representative conferences are currently used to exercise the functions and powers of the people's congress," the book says: "Taking our current conditions into consideration, the majority of our working people are still illiterate and have no election experience, so universal suffrage cannot be carried out, and we can only convene people's representative conferences to exercise the functions and powers of the people's congress first. ... After the majority of the people have undergone a relatively long period of election training and are generally literate, the people's representative conference system can gradually transition to the people's congress system."

    This explanation of why universal suffrage could not be implemented in the past because "the majority of the working people are still illiterate" and "have no election experience" is entirely a bourgeois viewpoint. If universal suffrage can only be implemented "after the majority of the people have undergone a relatively long period of election training and are generally literate," then today we want to implement the people's congress system and conduct universal suffrage, we can only allow a minority of literate people to vote, which would reject the majority of the still illiterate working people from the door of elections. Isn't this clearly asking us to take the election road of capitalist society? Article 14 of the Common Program clearly stipulates: "In places where military actions have completely ended, land reform has been thoroughly implemented, and people from all walks of life have been fully organized, universal suffrage should be implemented and local people's congresses should be convened." In fact, in the past three years, these conditions have been gradually met in some places, which have gradually transitioned from people's representative conferences to people's congresses. Nineteen provinces, eighty-five cities, four hundred and thirty-six counties, and more than two hundred and eighty thousand townships (villages) across the country have elected people's governments at various levels through people's representative conferences or township (village) peasant representative conferences. In the three years of democratic life, there has already been experience in conducting democratic elections. When explaining why universal suffrage could not be implemented in the past, the book "Talks on Democratic Construction and Administration" did not base its analysis on these conditions, but instead judged based on whether the working people were literate or had election experience, which is an unforgivable political error. Today, when the people of the whole country are actively taking action to prepare for this universal democratic election movement, this erroneous viewpoint and speech are extremely harmful and should be severely criticized.

    What is even more serious is that this book was compiled by the Civil Affairs Department of the Hunan Provincial People's Government, which shows that some cadres in our civil affairs work departments still have many confused ideas, are not serious about studying the policy documents of the Party and the government, and are not clear about the understanding that the people's congress system of universal suffrage is the basic system of our country. Today, it is extremely necessary to expand the propaganda and education on democratic construction and administration, and we suggest that the Hunan Provincial Press and Publication Administration should take appropriate action on the book "Talks on Democratic Construction and Administration."

    文化生活简评
    学习模范人民教师施新民的高贵品质
    安徽省泾县包村中心小学教师施新民平时热爱儿童、临危舍身殉职的事迹，说明了他是我们祖国、人民的一个可信赖的教育工作者。他对工作高度负责的精神，是值得全国教师学习的。
    施新民是热爱儿童的。他为了改造顽劣儿童，怀着母亲般的心情，关心儿童的学习，把教育力量深入到儿童生活的一切方面去，终于获得很大成就。这对于那些用种种体罚或变相体罚来“管制”儿童的教师们，对于那些坚持“棍棒底下出好人”的谬论的教师们，是一个极好的教训。
    施新民在平日工作中也是一贯负责的。他每天护送学生回家，风雨无阻。他不是领着他的学生，就是紧跟在他学生的身后，总叮咛着他们“好好走”。直到他为了抢救失足落水的孩子，跳下河去，将被洪水淹没了的时候，他还一再呼喊着：“救小孩子！救小孩子！”他不仅这样，他同时也勇于批评自己，并能够抱着与人为善的态度批评别人的缺点。其目的是把整个教学工作搞好。这对那些缺乏工作责任心，或对自己的工作只抱着“当一天和尚撞一天钟”的态度的教师们，不能不是一面镜子。
    施新民的品质是高贵的。他所以能具有这种高贵的品质，固然是由于党和人民政府的教育和培养；但同时也是由于他个人肯于虚心学习、努力改造自己。只有这样才能设想：像施新民这样一个出身在富农家庭的知识青年，终能深刻地认识、理解他自己的工作性质和工作责任，并忠于职守，完成祖国、人民对他的委托。
    施新民的牺牲是令人悲痛的，因为这是人民教育事业中的一大损失。但他的牺牲是光荣的，他的行为，足为人们的榜样。所以，“模范人民教师”的称号，他是当之无愧的。
    全国教师都应该很好地学习施新民的模范事迹。特别是那些认为教育祖国下一代的伟大工作，是“吃一辈子粉笔灰，划一辈子红圈儿，整天和孩子们在一起吵吵闹闹，没出息”的教师们；或曾犯有摧残、侮辱儿童的错误的教师们，更应该认真地检查一下自己的思想和工作，勇敢地批评自己的缺点和错误，以便端正自己的工作态度，改变自己的工作作风，进一步改造自己。
    “民主建政讲话”一书犯了提倡旧的资产阶级选举观点的错误
    湖南通俗读物出版社在一九五二年十一月出版的
    “民主建政讲话”一书，用资产阶级的观点来论述普选的人民代表大会制度，严重地歪曲了新民主主义制度下普选的民主实质。该书在谈到“目前为什么要用人民代表会议来代行人民代表大会的职权”的时候说：“拿我们现在的条件来说，我们大多数的劳动人民还不识字，也没有选举经验，这样就不能进行普选，只能先召开人民代表会议来代行人民代表大会的职权。……大多数的人民经过了比较长期的选举锻炼，并大体识字之后，就可以由人民代表会议制度渐渐走到人民代表大会制度。”
    这种把“大多数劳动人民还不识字”，“没有选举经验”来说明过去不能实行普选的原因，完全是一种资产阶级观点。如果“大多数的人民经过了比较长期的选举锻炼，并大体识字之后”才能实行普选的话，那末，我们今天要实行人民代表大会制度，进行普选，就只能由少数的识字人民来投票了，那样就将今天大多数的还不识字的劳动人民拒绝于选举的大门之外。这不是明明白白地要我们走资本主义社会的选举道路吗？共同纲领第十四条明确规定：“凡在军事行动已经完全结束、土地改革已经彻底实现、各界人民已有充分组织的地方，即应实行普选，召开地方的人民代表大会。”事实上过去三年来，这些条件成熟的地方已逐步地由人民代表会议过渡到人民代表大会。全国有十九个省，八十五个市，四百三十六个县和二十八万多个乡（村）里面的大部分乡（村），已由各界人民代表会议，或乡（村）农民代表会议选举出各该级的人民政府。在三年来的民主生活中，已经有了进行民主选举的经验。“民主建政讲话”一书说明过去不能实行普选的原因时，没有根据这些条件来分析，而以劳动人民识不识字、有没有选举经验来论断，这是一种不可原谅的政治错误。在全国人民正积极行动起来准备这次普遍的民主选举运动的今天，这种错误的观点和言论是极端有害的，应予以严厉的批判。
    更为严重的是这本书是湖南省人民政府民政厅编写的，这说明我们有些民政工作部门的干部思想上还存在许多糊涂观念，对党和政府政策文件的学习是不认真的，对普选的人民代表大会制度是我们国家的基本制度的认识是不清楚的。今天扩大民主建政的宣传和教育是十分必要的，我们建议湖南省新闻出版行政机关即对“民主建政讲话”一书进行适当的处理。
