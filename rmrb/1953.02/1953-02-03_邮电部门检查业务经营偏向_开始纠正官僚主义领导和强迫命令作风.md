    Postal and Telecommunications Departments Inspect Business Operation Deviations
    Begin Correcting Bureaucratic Leadership and Commandism

    [Reported by this newspaper] The central Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, in its leadership work, has neglected political and ideological education and lacked concrete and in-depth leadership, with the result that local postal and telecommunications bureaus, in the movement to increase production and practice economy, have unscrupulously developed business, one-sidedly pursued enterprise profits, and even violated laws and policies, damaged policies, and forced the masses to buy newspapers, periodicals, and stamps, creating extremely bad impressions among the masses and damaging the prestige of the Party and the government.
    According to inspections by the central Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications and the National Committee of the Postal and Telecommunications Workers' Union of China, and reflections from various localities, postal and telecommunications bureaus across the country, in order to increase revenue, mistakenly focused the development of business on special services, and made every effort to develop registered mail, return receipts, reply cards, express telephone calls, express telegrams, and other services. To develop these special services, they even propagated to the masses: "Single registration is single insurance, double registration is double insurance." "Ordinary telegrams are very slow, only express telegrams are fast." The Yian Postal and Telecommunications Bureau once "persuaded" the masses to change ordinary letters to registered letters, and single registered letters to double registered letters, so that double registered letters suddenly increased from 50% to 90%. All packages sent from Yangqu County Post Office had return receipts. A business office of the Xi'an Telecommunications Bureau even launched a so-called "telegram reclassification" campaign (i.e., changing ordinary telegrams to express telegrams), "mobilizing" the masses to change ordinary telegrams to express telegrams.
    Because commercial telecommunications charges are higher and military and government telecommunications charges are lower, many postal and telecommunications bureaus, in order to increase revenue, were willing to handle commercial telecommunications but unwilling to handle military and government telecommunications, seriously affecting the rapid connection of military and government telecommunications. In Changchun, there were three telephone business offices that pushed people to the main bureau when they wanted to send military or government telegrams. The Bengbu Telecommunications Bureau's long-distance telephone exchange delayed calls from military and government agencies, and prioritized general calls. Aviation meteorological telegrams in Songjiang Province were delayed due to backlog at the telecommunications bureau.
    Under the control of this purely profit-seeking mentality and purely task-oriented viewpoint, many telecommunications bureaus, disregarding national policies and laws, openly implemented compulsory distribution methods to achieve the purpose of completing tasks. Many telecommunications bureaus assigned tasks from top to bottom, requiring employees to complete them within a time limit. The Nanchang Postal and Telecommunications Bureau stipulated that every non-business employee must sell at least ten postal letters and three newspapers every day. The Changchun Telecommunications Bureau stipulated that the dozen or so people in the secretariat had to complete the task of installing sixty or seventy telephones. The Taiyuan Postal and Telecommunications Bureau, during National Day, called on all employees to subscribe to magazines, stipulating that those with a higher primary school education or above must subscribe to one copy each of "Study" and "New Observer", and those with a lower primary school education must subscribe to one copy each of "North China People". The director of the Changli Post Office in Hebei convened village postmen and assigned them the task of developing newspaper subscriptions. Village postman Li Baotang said: "I can't develop subscriptions!" The director even wanted to rectify his thinking, and Li Baotang had no choice but to accept the task. In some postal and telecommunications bureaus in Anhui, Sichuan, Guizhou, Pingyuan, and Qinghai, employees who failed to complete their assigned tasks had their salaries deducted. Some employees, because they could not complete their tasks, had to hand over the task of promoting newspapers and periodicals to their families. Some families set up stalls on the street to sell newspapers. Some employees had no choice but to pay for the newspapers themselves. Some employees, in order to complete extra assigned tasks, had to work overtime, extending their working hours and damaging their health.
    The phenomenon of telecommunications bureaus forcing the people to subscribe to newspapers, make phone calls, and purchase stamps was also very common. Employees of the Heilongjiang Sandaozhen Postal and Telecommunications Bureau repaired bicycles for others and gave them stamps and postal letters instead of RMB. The Xiangxiang Postal Bureau in Hunan forced the Yutang Township government to use the fruits of land reform to purchase 960,000 yuan worth of stamps, and tens of thousands of yuan worth of stamps have not yet been used. Some post offices also launched a so-called "send one, take one" campaign, giving the masses a letter and asking them to write a reply. Some post offices forced the masses to buy a newspaper every time they remitted money. The Nanjing Postal and Telecommunications Bureau sold 702 copies of the China Young Pioneers Newspaper in a primary school with 718 students. Employees of the Shanghai Postal Bureau even asked an old man in his sixties to subscribe to the China Young Pioneers Newspaper. The dyeing workshop of the Dalian Knitting Factory, with 163 employees, subscribed to 441 newspapers. The Xiao Guangsheng mutual aid team in Lanxi Xiwai Zi Village, with seven members who were all illiterate, subscribed to three copies of the Heilongjiang Daily, three copies of the Farmers' Daily, and six copies of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Newspaper. Some post offices, in order to sell more newspapers, even criticized those who did not subscribe to newspapers as being "politically undeveloped" and "ideologically backward". The director of a postal branch in Guilin openly said: "The Guangxi Daily is the newspaper of the Guangxi Provincial Party Committee, and whoever does not subscribe is dissatisfied with the Provincial Party Committee." These postal and telecommunications bureaus have caused dissatisfaction among the masses by forcing them to subscribe to newspapers and buy stamps. Some people sighed when they heard that the post office was coming to collect newspaper fees, saying: "Here comes the newspaper donation again!" Some farmers were very dissatisfied when they saw village postmen coming to promote newspaper subscriptions, saying: "Your post office wants to increase production, you should also take care of our economizing!" Some residents had to deal with several groups of postal and telecommunications employees coming to mobilize subscriptions and buy stamps on the same day, and felt very troubled, so they said to the postal and telecommunications employees: "You run back and forth, we really can't cope, please go to another house!"
    After discovering these serious deviations, the central Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications and the National Committee of the Postal and Telecommunications Workers' Union of China have issued instructions, ordering all postal and telecommunications bureaus across the country to thoroughly inspect and correct these deviations. Recently, the central Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications and the National Committee of the Postal and Telecommunications Workers' Union of China have decided to take correcting the above-mentioned deviations as the central task of the first quarter of 1953, and have formed working groups to go to the postal and telecommunications bureaus of various provinces and cities with a focus, to help them carry out the work of correcting deviations. Some postal and telecommunications bureaus have now begun to inspect their work, exposing shortcomings and errors in their work. However, the leading cadres of some postal and telecommunications bureaus still do not fully recognize the seriousness of these errors and have not taken the lead in conducting serious self-criticism. These postal and telecommunications bureaus must take the initiative to correct this incorrect attitude, conduct in-depth and serious inspections, and carry out criticism and self-criticism, so as to quickly reverse these serious deviations.

### 邮电部门检查业务经营偏向  开始纠正官僚主义领导和强迫命令作风

    邮电部门检查业务经营偏向
    开始纠正官僚主义领导和强迫命令作风
    【本报讯】中央邮电部在领导工作中，忽视政治思想教育，缺乏具体的深入的领导，以致各地邮电局在增产节约运动中，不择手段地发展业务，片面地追求企业利润，甚至违背法令、破坏政策、强迫群众购买报纸、刊物和邮票，在群众中造成极恶劣的印象，损害了党和政府的威信。
    根据中央邮电部和中国邮电工会全国委员会的检查与各地的反映，全国各邮电局为了多增加收入，错误地把发展业务的重点放在特种业务上，全力开展挂号、回执、回帖、加急电话、加急电报等业务。为了发展这些特种业务，他们居然向群众宣传：“单挂号单保险，双挂号双保险。”“普通电报慢得很，只有加急电报快。”依安邮电局曾经“说服”群众把平信改为挂号信，把单挂号信改为双挂号信，使得双挂号信从百分之五十突增至百分之九十。阳曲县邮局收寄的包裹，全部都有回执。西安电信局一个营业所还展开了所谓“电报改类”运动（即将普通电报改为加急电报），“动员”群众把普通电报改为加急电报。
    由于商业电信收费较多，军政电信收费较少，许多邮电局为了多增加收入，愿意接办商业电信，不愿意接办军政电信，严重地影响了军政电信的迅速的接通。长春有三处电话营业所，遇到有人要打军政电报，就往总局推。蚌埠电信局长途电话台推延军政机关的电话，而尽先接通一般电话。松江省的航空气象电报，就因为电信局积压而延误了。
    在这种单纯营利思想和单纯任务观点的支配下，不少电信局不顾国家的政策和法令，公然实行强迫摊派的办法，来达到完成任务的目的。许多电信局自上而下地分摊任务，要求职工限期完成。南昌邮电局规定每一个非营业人员每天至少要推销十个邮简和三份报纸。长春电信局规定秘书科的十几个人要完成六、七十台电话的任务。太原邮电局在国庆节号召全体职工订购杂志，规定有高小以上程度的人，每人订一份“学习”和“新观察”，高小以下程度的人每人订一份“华北人民”。河北昌黎邮局局长召集乡邮员，分配发展报纸的任务。乡邮员李保堂说：“我发展不了！”局长还要整他的思想，李保堂只好接受了任务。安徽、四川、贵州、平原、青海的一些邮电局职工完不成摊派的任务，就要被扣薪水。有些职工因为完不成任务，只好把分摊下来的推销报刊的任务，交给家属去完成。有些家属在大街上摆地摊卖报纸。有的职工实在没有办法，只好自己掏钱订报纸。有些职工为了完成额外的摊派的任务，只好加班加点，延长了工作时间，损害了身体的健康。
    电信局强迫人民群众订报纸、打电话、购买邮票的现象也很普遍。黑龙江三道镇邮电局职工在外面修理自行车，不给人民币，却给邮票和邮简。湖南湘乡邮政局强迫鱼塘乡乡政府用土地改革的果实购买了九十六万元的邮票，至今还有几十万元的邮票没有用掉。有些邮局还开展了所谓“投一揽一”运动，给群众一封信，还要群众写一封回信。有些邮局强迫群众汇一次款买一份报纸。南京邮电局在一个七百一十八人的小学校里，就推销了七百零二份中国少年报。上海邮政局的职工还要一个六十多岁的老人订了中国少年报。大连针织厂漂染车间一百六十三个职工，就订了四百四十一份报纸。兰西西围子屯萧广生互助组七个组员都不识字，却订了三份黑龙江报、三份农民报和六份中苏友好报。有些邮局为了多推销报纸，居然批评不订报纸的人是“政治不开展”、“思想落后”。桂林一个邮政支局局长公然说：“广西日报是广西省委的报纸，谁不订，就是对省委不满。”这些邮电局这样地强迫人民群众订报、购买邮票，已引起群众的不满。有些人听说邮局来收报费，就叹气说：“又来收报捐了！”有的农民看见乡邮员来推销报纸，很不满意地说：“你们邮局要增产，也该照顾我们的节约呀！”有些居民在同一天内，要应付好几批邮电职工来动员订报、买邮票，感到非常麻烦，因此对邮电职工说：“你们跑来跑去，我们实在无法应付，请你们另去别家吧！”
    中央邮电部和中国邮电工会全国委员会发现这些严重的偏向以后，已经发出指示，通令全国各邮电局，彻底检查和纠正这些偏向。最近中央邮电部和中国邮电工会全国委员会已决定把纠正上述偏向当作一九五三年第一季度的中心任务，并组成工作组，有重点地到各省、市邮电局，帮助它们进行纠正偏向的工作。有些邮电局现在已经开始检查工作，揭发工作中的缺点和错误。但有些邮电局的领导干部对于这些错误的严重性还认识不足，还没有带头进行认真的自我批评。这些邮电局必须主动纠正这种不正确的态度，深入地认真地进行检查，开展批评与自我批评，以便迅速扭转这些严重的偏向。
