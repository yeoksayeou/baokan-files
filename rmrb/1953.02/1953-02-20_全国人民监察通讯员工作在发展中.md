The work of people's supervision correspondents across the country has been developing.

Since the State Council issued the "Instructions on Strengthening People's Supervision Correspondents and People's Complaint Reception Rooms" on August 19, 1952, the organizations of people's supervision correspondents in various parts of the country have undergone a comprehensive rectification and have seen new development. As of the end of 1952, there were 26,111 people's supervision correspondents in agencies above the county and city level nationwide, an increase of more than five times compared to the time of the "Three-Anti" movement. For example, the central-level agencies and units originally had 305 people's supervision correspondents, which has now grown to 1,354; the Shenyang Municipal Supervision Committee originally had 42 people's supervision correspondents, which has now grown to 288; the Fujian Provincial Supervision Committee originally only had 68 people's supervision correspondents at the provincial level, but now the entire province has developed to 1,366. In this rectification and development of supervision correspondents in various regions, steps were taken, including mobilizing the masses, democratic elections, and review and appointment by the supervision committee. Therefore, the current people's supervision correspondents are all activists from the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, as well as in production and work, possessing qualities such as fairness, responsibility, loyalty, courage, and being good at connecting with the masses. For example, among the 564 people's supervision correspondents in Henan province-level agencies, 98 percent were models or activists in the "Three-Anti" movement. Those former people's supervision correspondents who did not meet these conditions were eliminated after re-election. For example, among the 71 people's supervision correspondents originally in the Hunan Provincial People's Supervision Committee, 37 were not re-elected because they were involved in unclean dealings during the "Three-Anti" movement or had no achievements in their daily work. At the same time, in conjunction with the election of people's supervision correspondents, education on people's supervision work and democratic education was also conducted among state personnel and the broad masses, thereby further enhancing the enthusiasm and confidence of the masses in supervising government work.

After being elected and appointed, the people's supervision correspondents actively launched a series of activities, such as establishing groups, formulating plans, establishing meeting and reporting systems, assigning specific personnel to manage suggestion boxes, holding mass forums, and using broadcasting and wall posters for propaganda and education. Moreover, many people's supervision correspondents have already created some experiences in their work and achieved good results. For example, the people's supervision correspondents of the Ministry of Foreign Trade discovered and reported 147 issues in the one-month period after their establishment in September of last year; the people's supervision correspondents of Guangzhou reported and reported 235 issues in the four months from July to October last year; and the people's supervision correspondents of the directly subordinate units of the Ministry of Heavy Industry also reported 39 issues in the two months after their establishment in November last year. Many of the problems reflected and exposed by the people's supervision correspondents are very important, generally falling into the following categories: First, they exposed many incidents in the process of capital construction where a lack of design or inadequate design and blind construction hindered the completion of tasks and caused serious losses. For example, the people's supervision correspondents of the Electric Power Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Fuel Industry reported that in December of last year, in the capital construction project of a factory in Liangxiang, the disconnection between design and construction resulted in the demolition of 86 dormitories that had already been built, resulting in a loss of more than 60 million yuan; the losses in other projects are still under investigation. Another example is the people's supervision correspondents of the Ministry of Heavy Industry reported that the Central-South Explosives Factory, under the Chemical Industry Bureau of the ministry, had been preparing for more than a year without any progress, seriously affecting the work morale of the cadres. Second, they exposed various forms of bureaucratic work style in certain agencies. For example, Tianjin China Equipment Company imported a batch of magnetic scales at the end of last year, and due to poor management, the estimated loss of state property was more than 1.5 billion yuan. The leadership of the hospital of the Ministry of Heavy Industry was irresponsible and mechanically implemented the system, failing to provide emergency care for a family member of a cadre of the ministry suffering from a hemorrhagic emergency, and sat idly by as the patient's condition continued to develop. Both of these incidents were exposed by the people's supervision correspondents and are currently being investigated and dealt with by the relevant leading agencies. A document from the People's Bank of Fujian Province traveled through seven units, received twenty-one seals, and took two months without being resolved. After the people's supervision correspondents of the bank discovered it and made suggestions, the responsible unit immediately convened a meeting and resolved it in just one hour. The Harbin Tram Factory accepted the suggestions of the factory's people's supervision correspondents, revised the line construction plan, and saved the state more than 28 million yuan in funds. Third, they timely and effectively exposed and stopped the occurrence of a few cases of embezzlement and theft after the "Three-Anti" movement. For example, the embezzlement problem of Zhang Baoxi of the Economic Research Institute of the Ministry of Foreign Trade was exposed by the people's supervision correspondents after the "Three-Anti" movement. After investigation, it was found that he had used public funds more than 20 times, totaling more than 2.7 million yuan, and the Supervision Office of the Ministry of Foreign Trade has given him a demotion. Zhai Fengju, a clerk of the First Peking Opera Troupe of the Chinese Academy of Traditional Opera, was in charge of food during the National Opera Festival last year and altered receipts nine times, embezzling 912,000 yuan. After being exposed by the people's supervision correspondents, he has been given a demotion administratively. Fourth, many agencies have greatly improved the welfare conditions of their employees due to the suggestions of the people's supervision correspondents. For example, the original bathhouse, tea stove, and other facilities of Jinxi Chemical Plant could not be used due to poor management, resulting in workers not having tea to drink when thirsty and the bathhouse not being sufficient. After Liu Ping, a people's supervision correspondent of the Ministry of Heavy Industry, raised this issue, the leadership of the factory made a self-criticism and promised to "pay attention to correcting it in the future." The medical equipment of Wuxi Machine Factory was very rudimentary in the past, and the workers had many complaints. After the people's supervision correspondents reported it to the People's Supervision Committee of Southern Jiangsu, the factory has now hired more doctors and added medical equipment and hygiene facilities after inspection by the People's Supervision Committee. In short, through the accusations and exposures of the people's supervision correspondents, they have played an extremely important role in improving leadership, improving work, correcting deviations, overcoming shortcomings, and recovering losses of state property.

The main reasons why people's supervision correspondents have been able to achieve such results are as follows: (1) The people's supervision correspondents are active and enthusiastic about revolutionary work, have a high sense of responsibility for the interests of the country and the people, and have a revolutionary spirit of adhering to the truth and persisting in struggle against various bad tendencies. For example, Liu Ping, a people's supervision correspondent of the Ministry of Heavy Industry, still performed the duties of a people's supervision correspondent when she was on a business trip to Jinxi Chemical Plant. Qiao Shuhuan, a people's supervision correspondent of the Rehe Province Egg Products Company, was attacked and threatened for accusing the company's manager of embezzlement. However, Qiao did not lose heart, continued to collect materials, verified the facts, and reported to higher authorities. Finally, with conclusive evidence that could not be denied, the company's manager confessed to his embezzlement. (2) Because the people's supervision correspondents are produced from the masses and have a solid mass base, every work activity of theirs embodies the mass line of mobilizing the masses and relying on the masses. After the Ministry of Geology set up a people's suggestion box, it did not receive a single letter of opinion in a week. After the people's supervision correspondents used big-character posters and oral propaganda to inspire the enthusiasm of the masses, it quickly received fifteen letters of opinion. The people's supervision correspondents of some agencies also paid attention to contacting activists among the masses, often absorbing activists to participate in the people's supervision correspondent group meetings, introducing them to relevant supervision work documents for study, and assigning them certain tasks, making them powerful assistants to the people's supervision correspondents. The "small household chores" problem of Harbin Machinery Factory No. 10 was thoroughly resolved because the activists provided clues and assisted the people's supervision correspondents in extensively collecting materials and submitting them to the Municipal People's Supervision Committee.

(3) The timely leadership of the people's supervision organs at all levels, frequently convening people's supervision correspondent meetings, assisting them in solving problems, exchanging experiences, and supervising, deploying, and inspecting their work. The reason why the people's supervision correspondents in Tianjin have achieved such good results is due to the attention and active leadership of the Municipal People's Supervision Committee. (4) The strong support of the leaders of various agencies. For example, the Party and government leaders of the Financial and Economic Committee of the State Council jointly issued a notice to directly subordinate units, proposing three measures to support the people's supervision correspondents in carrying out their work: giving them time convenience, not accumulating accusations, and not retaliating against and attacking accusers, thereby enhancing the confidence and determination of the people's supervision correspondents to do a good job. Another example is that when the director of the Publishing Administration received the opinions of the people's supervision correspondents, he personally instructed cadres above the bureau director level to read and discuss them for handling. (5) Because the people's supervision correspondents are able to combine supervision work with the central tasks and main business of their agencies, discovering problems from the central movement and carrying out supervision work, thus not only doing supervision work and helping to do a good job in the central movement, but also overcoming the contradiction between the part-time nature of the people's supervision correspondents and their main duties, and overcoming the contradiction between supervision work and administrative work. For example, the people's supervision correspondents of the Ministry of Foreign Trade combined with the Party rectification and study in the ministry to discover and reflect more than 100 opinions, greatly promoting the development of the Party rectification movement. The people's supervision correspondents of the Finance and Accounting Bureau of the Ministry of Commerce initially suffered from the inability to carry out supervision work and regarded the work of serving as people's supervision correspondents as an extra burden. By last winter, they actively participated in the administrative inspection movement of lower-level businesses, discovered that the companies under the ministry had many major problems, such as unclear family backgrounds, blind allocation, and accumulation of large amounts of funds, and reported them to the leading comrades for correction. The above reasons are not mutually isolated. People's supervision correspondents must strive for the attention of higher authorities and the support of the masses with their own subjective efforts and excellent achievements; conversely, the attention of higher authorities and the support of the masses can also encourage people's supervision correspondents to do a good job and achieve greater results. Therefore, subjective efforts, making achievements, the attention of higher authorities, and the support of the masses are mutually coordinated, mutually influential, and mutually promoting.

However, the work of the people's supervision correspondents has not yet received widespread attention. First of all, some departments still do not have organizations of people's supervision correspondents. There are seven departments at the central level alone, including the Culture and Education Committee of the State Council, the Ministry of Higher Education, the Ministry of Education, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the Political and Legal Committee, the Legislative Affairs Committee, and the Ministry of Justice of the State Council, which have not yet been established despite repeated urging by the People's Supervision Committee of the State Council. This is not right. Secondly, the leading comrades of many units treat this work with fluctuating enthusiasm, being very active during establishment, but considering the problems reflected by the supervision correspondents to be "small things," not dealing with them in a timely manner, or not dealing with them at all; some agency leaders have never supervised or inspected their work within one or two months after the establishment of supervision correspondents, completely leaving them to their own devices. For example, the people's supervision correspondents of the Ministry of Finance have not held meetings, formulated plans, or even submitted work reports since their establishment in September and October last year. All of these phenomena of not paying attention to or not paying enough attention to supervision work will affect the development of mass supervision work, and therefore, it is necessary to resolutely struggle against them and thoroughly correct them.

    全国人民监察通讯员工作在发展中
    一九五二年八月十九日政务院发出“关于加强人民监察通讯员和人民检举接待室的指示”以后，全国各地人民监察通讯员的组织都进行了一次普遍整顿，并有了新的发展。截至一九五二年年底，全国县市以上机关现有人民监察通讯员二万六千一百一十一人，比“三反”运动时增加了五倍以上。如中央一级各机关单位原有人民监察通讯员三百零五名，现在已经发展到一千三百五十四名；沈阳市监察委员会原有人民监察通讯员四十二名，现在已经发展到二百八十八名；福建省监察委员会原来仅有省一级的人民监察通讯员六十八名，现在全省已经发展到一千三百六十六名。各地在这次整顿和发展监察通讯员工作中，都经过了发动群众、民主选举、监察委员会审查任命等步骤，因此现在的人民监察通讯员都是“三反”“五反”运动中以及生产、工作中的积极分子，具有公正负责、忠实勇敢、善于联系群众等条件。如河南省一级机关中的五百六十四名人民监察通讯员中，百分之九十八是“三反”运动中的模范或积极分子。凡是不具备这些条件的原任人民监察通讯员，经过重选后，都被淘汰了。如湖南省人民监察委员会原有的人民监察通讯员七十一名中，有三十七名因在“三反”中手面不干净或平日工作无成绩而落了选。同时，结合人民监察通讯员的选举，对国家工作人员及广大群众也进行了一次人民监察工作的教育和民主教育，从而更进一步地提高了群众监督政府工作的积极性和自信心。
    人民监察通讯员经过选举任命之后，随即积极展开了一系列的活动，如建立小组，制定计划，规定会议、汇报制度，指定专人管理意见箱，召开群众座谈会和利用广播、墙报进行宣教工作等等。并且不少的人民监察通讯员已经在工作中创造了一些经验，获得了很好的成绩。如中央对外贸易部的人民监察通讯员自去年九月间建立后的一个多月内，发现和反映了问题一百四十七件；广州市人民监察通讯员在去年七月到十月四个月中就反映和报告了问题二百三十五件；中央重工业部直属单位的人民监察通讯员于去年十一月份建立后二个多月中，也反映了问题三十九件。人民监察通讯员所反映和揭发的问题有很多是非常重要的，大体上有下列几方面的问题：第一、揭发了许多在基本建设过程中，由于缺乏设计或设计不周，盲目施工，妨碍了任务的完成并造成了严重损失的事件。如中央燃料工业部电业管理总局人民监察通讯员反映该局去年十二月间在良乡某工厂的基本建设工程中，由于设计和施工脱节，拆掉已经盖好了的八十六间宿舍，就损失六千万元以上；其他工程中的损失，还正在调查中。又如中央重工业部人民监察通讯员反映该部化学工业局所属中南炸药厂筹备了一年多，尚无一点头绪，严重地影响了干部的工作情绪。第二、揭发了某些机关各式各样的官僚主义作风。如天津中国器材公司在去年年底入口一批磁秤，因为没有保管好，估计损失国家财产在十五亿元以上。中央重工业部医院领导方面不负责任，机械执行制度，对于该部某干部家属患流血急症，没有尽到急救责任，坐视病人病状继续发展。这两件事都经人民监察通讯员揭发出来，现正由有关领导机关进行检查处理。福建省人民银行有一件公文曾旅行了七个单位，盖了二十一个图章，历时两月，未获解决。经该行人民监察通讯员发现并提出意见后，主管单位随即召开会议，仅用了一小时的时间就把它解决了。哈尔滨电车厂接受了该厂人民监察通讯员的建议，修改了线路的建设计划，为国家节省了资金二千八百余万元。第三、及时有效地揭发、制止了“三反”后少数贪污盗窃行为的发生。如对外贸易部经济研究所章葆熙的贪污问题，就是在“三反”后经人民监察通讯员揭露出来的。经调查，他曾先后动用公款二十余次，共二百七十余万元，对外贸易部监察室已给以降职处分。中国戏曲研究院第一京剧团文书翟凤举，在去年全国戏曲观摩演出时管伙食，曾先后涂改单据九次，贪污了九十一万二千元，经人民监察通讯员揭发后，行政上已给以撤职处分。第四、许多机关由于人民监察通讯员的建议，大大改善了职工的福利条件。如锦西化工厂原有的浴池、茶炉等设备，由于管理不好，大部分不能应用，造成工人渴时没茶喝及浴池不够用的现象。经重工业部人民监察通讯员刘萍提出后，该厂领导上作了检讨，并保证“今后注意纠正”。无锡机器厂过去的医疗设备很简陋，工人意见很大，经人民监察通讯员反映到苏南人民监察委员会，经人民监察委员会检查后，该厂现在已经增聘了医生，增添了医疗设备和卫生装置等。总之，通过人民监察通讯员的检举和揭发，对于改善领导、改进工作、纠正偏向、克服缺点、挽回国家财产的损失等方面，均起到了极其重大的作用。
    人民监察通讯员所以能够取得这样的成绩，主要的原因有下面几点：（一）人民监察通讯员对革命工作积极热情，对国家人民的利益富有高度的责任感，对各种不良倾向具有坚持真理、坚持斗争的革命精神。如中央重工业部人民监察通讯员刘萍出差到锦西化工厂时，仍然执行着人民监察通讯员的职务。热河省蛋品公司人民监察通讯员乔树桓检举该公司经理的贪污问题，遭到了打击与威胁。但乔并不气馁，继续搜集材料，对证事实，并向上级反映。最后在证据确凿无法抵赖的情况下，该公司经理坦白了自己的贪污事实。（二）因为人民监察通讯员是从群众中产生的，有巩固的群众基础，他们的每一工作活动都体现了发动群众、依靠群众的群众路线。中央地质部设置人民意见箱后的一周内，连一件意见信也没收到，经过人民监察通讯员利用大字报和口头进行宣传，启发了群众的积极性，很快就收到了十五件意见信。有的机关的人民监察通讯员还注意了联系群众中的积极分子，经常吸收积极分子参加人民监察通讯员小组会，介绍有关监察工作的文件给他们学习，布置他们一定的任务，使他们成为人民监察通讯员的有力助手。哈尔滨机械十厂的“小家务”问题，就是由于积极分子提供了线索，并协助人民监察通讯员广泛搜集材料，提到市人民监察委员会而得到了彻底解决的。
    （三）各级人民监察机关的及时领导，经常召开人民监察通讯员会议，协助他们解决问题，交流经验，督促、布置、检查他们的工作。像天津市的人民监察通讯员所以取得了很好的成绩，就是由于市人民监察委员会的重视和积极领导的结果。（四）各机关领导的大力支持。如政务院财政经济委员会党、政领导方面联合向直属单位发出通知，提出给予人民监察通讯员以时间上的方便、不积压检举意见、不报复与打击检举人等三条办法，支持人民监察通讯员开展工作，从而增强了人民监察通讯员搞好工作的信心和决心。又如出版总署署长收到人民监察通讯员意见时，亲自批示局长以上干部传阅，并讨论处理。（五）由于人民监察通讯员能够把监察工作结合着本机关的中心任务和主要业务来进行，从中心运动中去发现问题，开展监察工作，这样，就既做了监察工作，帮助搞好了中心运动，又克服了人民监察通讯员的兼职与本职的矛盾，克服了监察工作与行政工作的矛盾。如中央对外贸易部的人民监察通讯员结合该部整党学习，发现和反映了一百多条意见，大大地推动了整党运动的开展。中央商业部财务会计局的人民监察通讯员，起初老苦于监察工作展不开，把担任人民监察通讯员的工作当成额外负担。到去年冬，他们积极地参加了行政上所布置的对下级业务的检查运动，发现了该部所属各公司存在着许多家底不清、盲目调拨、积压大批资金等重要问题，报告给领导同志进行了纠正。以上几点原因并不是彼此孤立的。人民监察通讯员必须以自己的主观努力及优异成绩，争取上级的重视与群众的支持；反过来，上级的重视和群众的支持也能鼓舞人民监察通讯员做好工作，取得更大的成绩。因之主观努力、作出成绩、上级重视、群众支持等彼此之间，是互相配合、互相影响、互相推动的。
    不过，目前人民监察通讯员的工作还没有受到普遍的重视。首先是有的部门至今还没有人民监察通讯员的组织，单中央一级机关就有政务院文化教育委员会、高等教育部、教育部、中国科学院及政务院政治法律委员会、法制委员会、司法部等七个部门，虽经政务院人民监察委员会的屡次催促，但仍未建立起来。这是不对的。其次是有不少单位的领导同志对待这项工作表现忽冷忽热，建立时非常积极，但对于监察通讯员反映的问题却认为是“小事情”，不及时处理，或根本不处理；还有些机关领导人在监察通讯员建立后一、二个月内，从不督促、检查他们的工作，完全放任自流。如中央财政部人民监察通讯员自去年九、十月间建立以来，没有开过会，没有制定计划，更没有工作报告。所有这些不重视或不够重视监察工作的现象，都将影响着群众性监察工作的开展，因之必须与之进行坚决的斗争，彻底纠正。（政务院人民监察委员会通讯组）
