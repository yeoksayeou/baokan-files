    Russian Typists Should Be Trained
    A teacher from the Russian Language Class of the Cadre Training Program of the Central Ministry of Construction Engineering writes: With the large-scale national construction work and the upsurge in learning from the Soviet Union, the need for Russian typing work will greatly increase, and Russian typists will be in short supply. At present, typing schools only train Chinese and English typists. It is suggested that the relevant departments, such as the Central Ministry of Education, pay attention to this issue and try to train some Russian typists.

    应该训练俄文打字人员
    中央建筑工程部干部训练班俄文班一教员来信：在国家大规模建设工作中和学习苏联的热潮中，俄文打字工作的需要必将大大增加，俄文打字人员也会感到不足。目前各打字学校还只培养中、英文打字人员。建议中央教育部等有关部门重视这个问题，设法培养一些俄文打字人员。
