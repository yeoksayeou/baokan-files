    Bao Lan Comes to the Old Ren Family
    ——A Story of Ding Baolan, the Fiancée of Volunteer Soldier Ren Zhongchang
    Wu Fazhong
    I.
    On January 4th, it was snowing heavily, and a northwesterly wind was blowing. That day, I followed the carts delivering public grain, leaving Suihua City (Heilongjiang Province) to visit Ding Baolan, the fiancée of Volunteer soldier Ren Zhongchang in Lijia Village.
    Ren Zhongchang's family lived in their own courtyard, with two main rooms, a neatly arranged grain storage, and a woodpile. One look at the courtyard, and you knew it was a family that knew how to manage.
    As soon as we arrived at the door, Ding Baolan ran out to greet us, and the family's little black dog wagged its tail, running around us. After I entered the house, Ding Baolan offered cigarettes and boiled water, warmly welcoming us. This was the second time I had seen Ding Baolan. She was the same as before: with two braids, wearing a black cotton-padded coat, still so strong, and her big eyes always smiling when she spoke. After I explained my purpose, Ding Baolan took out the letters Ren Zhongchang had sent from the front lines to show me.
    II.
    Ding Baolan's family lived in Nihe South. She came to Guanwai (outside the Pass) from Hebei Province with her parents when she was a child. Her father made a living by doing petty trading, and her mother was often ill. The elderly couple had only one son and one daughter. The son worked in Shenyang, leaving Baolan at home with her mother. Baolan was clever and skillful since she was a child. She could do any work after seeing it once, and she did it very well. She was not afraid of hardship when working, just like a boy. The people in the village all praised her.
    When Ren Zhongchang was nineteen, his parents died, and he lived with his two younger brothers, one fourteen and one nine, and his fourth uncle and fourth aunt. The fourth uncle and aunt were both over sixty years old and blind, relying on Ren Zhongchang for their livelihood.
    Ren Zhongchang's aunt's family also lived in Nihe South, in the same village as Ding Baolan's family, and the courtyards were in the front and back. In summer, when the windows were opened, the two families could see each other eating meals in their houses. Ren Zhongchang's uncle and Ding Baolan's father were the best of friends, having come from Guanli (inside the Pass) together. When Ren Zhongchang went to his aunt's house, Baolan's mother was sometimes there, and Baolan was also there. Over time, they got to know each other, and in 1949, Ren Zhongchang and Ding Baolan got engaged.
    After the engagement, Ren Zhongchang went to his aunt's house more often than before, both to visit his aunt and to see Baolan. One time, Ren Zhongchang went to his aunt's house again, and Baolan was also there. Ren Zhongchang heard his aunt saying outside the window, "The children are not young anymore, I wonder if they can get married this year." Baolan quickly interjected, "Get married this year? If they were going to, they would have given a sign already. It's almost time to harvest wheat!" As soon as Baolan finished speaking, Ren Zhongchang entered the house. Baolan saw him come in, blushed, flipped her braids, and ran home. "Third Aunt, what were you chatting about just now?" Ren Zhongchang asked deliberately. His aunt pointed to the front room and said, "Wasn't it about whether you two can get married this year!" Ren Zhongchang said straightforwardly, "We can! Tell her family, during the autumn harvest. That's what I came for."
    After Ren Zhongchang returned home, he discussed it with his brothers, saying, "Let's work hard. When I get married in the fall, we'll be like one family."
    In 1950, American imperialism launched the war of aggression against Korea, and the flames of war threatened our country's borders. The people of the whole country launched the movement to Resist America, Aid Korea, Protect the Homeland. Ren Zhongchang put aside the marriage and joined the Chinese People's Volunteers with eight other young people from the village.
    III.
    When the news of Ren Zhongchang's joining the army reached Baolan's family, she had the idea of going to the old Ren family to see how things were. Later, she finally went alone. After Baolan arrived at the old Ren family's house, she first went to the fields to see the crops. The crops were growing green and lush. But the house was a mess, not like a home at all, the food was not like food, and the clothes were not like clothes. After she went back, some people in Lijia Village said: This is terrible, Ding Baolan has come to understand the situation. Just listen, she will definitely ask for a divorce when she goes back.
    After Ding Baolan returned home, she told her mother everything about Ren Zhongchang's family. Her mother listened without expressing any opinion. Baolan was always worried. She thought: Although someone is cultivating his family's land, no one is doing the housework. If he knows about his family's situation at the front, how can he wholeheartedly fight the American devils? I might as well go to his house first, take good care of his family, and live a good life. Anyway, we are a family. After she had this idea, she often talked to her mother about the difficulties of the old Ren family. One time, her mother asked her, "What do you want to do?" Baolan blushed and lowered her head. Her mother said, "You are a grown girl, going there without being married yet, aren't you afraid people will laugh at you?" Baolan raised her head high and said, "The new society is not like the old society. We are not afraid. I will live our own good life. We are not doing anything bad, what is there to be afraid of!" In the end, her mother said, "If you really want to go, ask your father." Baolan said angrily, "You don't agree with her doing a good thing, I won't ask my father, I'm leaving tomorrow anyway."
    That night, her father knew that Baolan wanted to go to the old Ren family, and scolded her for half the night. Finally, he said to Baolan, "You are not allowed to go! Can't the people in Henan do without you, are you going to disgrace the people in Hebei? Women's liberation has gone too far! A girl in her twenties is going without being married." Baolan didn't say anything and went to sleep.
    The next day, her father went out to do business as usual, thinking that Baolan would not go. But Baolan went with a small bundle. She was caught in a heavy rain on the way, and it was almost dark when she arrived at Lijia Village. Baolan entered the house, and in less than the time it takes to smoke a bag of tobacco, the house was full of people. Old Mrs. Li entered the house and said, "I thought you couldn't come. It's so good that you came, it's so honorable. Ren Zhongchang will be overjoyed when he knows. Tell us if you have any difficulties in the future, we will help you solve them." Everyone in the room said: Baolan is a good woman, not to mention unmarried, even married ones don't always live well. From then on, Baolan lived with Ren Zhongchang's two younger brothers and two elderly people.
    IV.
    Working inside and outside the house, on the bed and on the ground, getting up early and working late, in less than half a month, the work was done. Ren Zhongchang's third younger brother, Xiao Zhonglin, joked with Baolan, "Big Sister, our family has changed since you came." Baolan said indifferently, "How has it changed?" Xiao Zhonglin said, "How can it not change, the new bride has come and tidied up the house!" After speaking, he laughed and ran out.
    Baolan not only actively did housework, but also participated in the mutual aid team, and the women elected her as the team leader. After Baolan joined the team, she used Ren Zhongchang's second brother, Zhonghe's name to write a letter to Ren Zhongchang, telling him about the family's situation. The letter also said at the end: Baolan has also come to our house.
    Soon, Ren Zhongchang wrote back to his second brother from the front, saying, "I received the letter from home and I am very happy to know that the cultivated land is doing very well. I may not be able to do as well even if I am at home." He also said, "Baolan will not come, her family has no one, and besides, she is not married, she cannot come. You are lying."
    Baolan was listening to the letter being read beside her and thought to herself: Ah, you still don't believe me, who can deceive you! Tomorrow I will go to the street to take a picture and mail it to you, to see if you believe it or not.
    Although Ren Zhongchang was at the front and Ding Baolan was in the rear, the two of them were not together, but they said more to each other in their letters than they did when they lived together. Ding Baolan wrote to Ren Zhongchang after each stage of production was completed, and Ren Zhongchang immediately told her about his fighting and learning at the front after receiving the letter. They encouraged each other to kill more American devils and produce more grain.
    After planting the large fields and hoeing the first crop of wheat, Ding Baolan wrote a very vivid letter to Ren Zhongchang. The letter read: "Our land is planted very well, with plenty of manure. Now the seedlings are all out, growing fat and big, and the first crop of wheat has also been hoeed. Nine of the twelve women in our women's team are working in the fields, removing weeds, picking weeds, supporting seedlings when planting, and the first wheat crop was hoeed by us women. I am the head of the women's production team. During the spring ploughing, our team was rated as a model team, and I also attended the county's labor model conference. When the labor model conference was held, it coincided with the visit of volunteer representatives returning from Korea and Korean representatives visiting China. After listening to their reports, I also learned about your situation. I also embroidered two handkerchiefs for them: one for the Volunteers, embroidered with 'Dedicated to My Beloved Ones', and one for the People's Army, embroidered with 'Sino-Korean Friendship'." Baolan told Zhongchang in the letter: "Kill more American devils and make meritorious service!"
    Ren Zhongchang received Ding Baolan's letter and immediately wrote back. He told Baolan that they were learning the accelerated literacy method, and that it would not be difficult to read and write after learning it. He also said that the glorious commemorative medal for Resisting America and Aiding Korea had been issued. He hoped that Baolan would also strive for greater glory.
    From this time on, after Ren Zhongchang's letter, Ding Baolan's production enthusiasm became even higher. After the harvest, Baolan wrote another letter to Ren Zhongchang, telling him about the bumper harvest at home. She wrote: "This year is a bumper harvest year, with an average yield of seven dan of grain per qing of land. The whole team has completed the production plan. Our family has not only paid off the past debts, but also bought more than fifty feet of cloth and more than ten jin of cotton, and we are all wearing new cotton-padded clothes. We plan to sell the remaining grain next year to buy a horse, and repair the house. This time I challenge you, I hope you will be a hero at the front, and I will be a model in the rear, to see who becomes one first."
    Soon, Ren Zhongchang's reply came again, with several doves of peace and a few red flowers drawn on it. In the letter he thanked Baolan for taking care of the family and said: "I accept your challenge, I will kill more American devils and strive to be a hero."

    宝兰上老任家来了
    ——记志愿军战士任忠昌的未婚妻丁宝兰
    吴发众
    一
    一月四日，天下着大雪，还刮着西北风。这天，我跟着送公粮的大车，出绥化城（黑龙江省）到李家屯去访问志愿军战士任忠昌的未婚妻丁宝兰。
    任忠昌家自己住一个院，两间正房，粮食仓子、柴火堆都整理的很整齐。一看这院子，就知道是个会过日子的人家。
    刚到屋门口，丁宝兰就跑出来迎接了，看家的小黑狗也摇着尾巴身前身后跑着。等我进屋以后，丁宝兰就拿烟、烧水，热情地招待。我这次是第二次看到丁宝兰了。她和先前一样：扎着两条辫子，穿一身黑棉衣，还是那样健壮，说话时两个大眼睛总是笑眯眯的。我说明来意后，丁宝兰就从柜子里把任忠昌从前方写来的信拿出来给我看。
    二
    丁宝兰家在泥河南住，她是小时候跟爸妈从河北省来关外的。爸爸依靠作个小买卖生活，妈妈经常有病。他老俩口就一个儿子，一个姑娘。儿子在沈阳做工，家里就剩下宝兰在妈妈身边。宝兰从小心就灵，手也巧，什么活一看就能做，做出来还很好。干起活儿来不怕吃苦，和男孩一样，屯里的人都夸奖她。
    任忠昌十九岁时，就死去爸妈，领着一个十四岁、一个九岁的弟弟过日子，和四爷、四奶住在一起。四爷、四奶都是六十多岁的人了，眼也瞎了，都靠着任忠昌过活。
    任忠昌姨家也在泥河南住，和丁宝兰家住在一个屯子，而且是前后院。到夏天一开窗户，两家在屋里吃饭啥的彼此都能看见。任忠昌的姨父和丁宝兰父亲是最好的朋友，一块从关里过来的。任忠昌上姨娘家去，有时宝兰妈妈也在，宝兰也在；一来二去的，时间长了，彼此都了解了，一九四九年，任忠昌就和丁宝兰订了婚。
    订婚后，任忠昌上姨家去的次数也比从前多了，一来看看姨娘，二来也捎带看看宝兰。有一次任忠昌又到姨家去，宝兰也在。任忠昌在窗外听姨娘说：“孩子都不小了，不知今年能不能办喜事。”宝兰很快接过去说：“今年还能办？要办早给信了。都快割麦子啦！”宝兰刚说完，任忠昌就进屋了。宝兰看见他进来了，就红着脸，把辫子一甩，跑回家去了。“三姨，你们方才唠啥来的？”任忠昌故意问。他姨娘用手指前屋说：“还不是唠你们今年能不能办喜事呗！”任忠昌很干脆地说：“能办！你告诉她家吧，在大秋。我就是为这事来的。”
    任忠昌回家后，和弟弟们合计说：“好好干吧，到秋我结了婚，咱们就像一家人家啦。”
    一九五○年，美帝国主义发动了侵朝战争，战火威胁着我国边境，全国人民掀起了抗美援朝保家卫国运动。任忠昌把结婚的事情丢下，和村里的八个青年一道参加了中国人民志愿军。
    三
    当任忠昌参军的消息传到宝兰家的时候，她就有心思上老任家看看去。后来终于她一个人去了。宝兰到了老任家后，先到地里看看庄稼，庄稼长得绿油油的，又肥又壮。可就是家里乱七八糟，不像样子，吃的不像吃的，穿的不像穿的。她回去后，李家屯有些人说：这下子可坏啦，丁宝兰来了解情况啦，听着吧，回去非要离婚不可。
    丁宝兰回去后，把任忠昌家的情况一五一十地都告诉了妈妈，妈妈听了没表示什么意见。宝兰总是放心不下，她想：他家里的地虽然有人代耕，但是屋里活没人做，他在前方要知道家里的这种情况，怎么能全心全意打美国鬼子呢？倒不如我先去他家，好好照顾他的一家老小，把日子过好了，反正是我们自己的。她有了这个念头后，就时常把老任家的困难和妈妈讲。有一次妈妈问她：“你想去咋的？”宝兰红着脸，低着头。妈说：“挺大的姑娘，没等人家娶，自己挟包就去啦，不怕人家笑话吗？”宝兰把头抬得高高地说：“新社会不像旧社会啦，我们不怕，我去过我们自己的好日子，也不是做坏事，怕啥！”最后妈妈说：“你实在要去，问问你爸爸吧。”宝兰生着气说：“人家做正事，你都不给作主，我不问爸爸，反正我明天就走。”
    晚上，爸爸知道宝兰要上老任家去，足足骂了半宿，最后对宝兰说：“不准你去！她妈的，河南丢不下你这人啦，上河北丢人去？妇女提高也太过火啦！二十多岁的大姑娘，没等人家娶自己就去啦。”宝兰也没作声就睡觉了。
    第二天，爸爸照常出外作买卖，他想宝兰不会去了。可是宝兰挟个小红包袱就去了。走到半道上还挨了一阵大雨浇，到了李家屯天快黑了。宝兰进到屋里，不到一袋烟工夫，屋里就拥满了人。老李太太进屋就说：“我寻思你不能来啦，这回你来可太好啦，太光荣啦。任忠昌要知道可要乐坏了。你以后有什么困难和我们提吧，我们帮助你解决。”一屋子的人都说：宝兰是好样的，别说没过门的，就是过门的还有不好好过的呢。宝兰从此就同任忠昌一样，跟两个小弟弟和两个老人家一起过日子了。
    四
    屋里屋外、炕上地下、起早贪黑地做，不到半个月，活计就干出头绪了。任忠昌的三弟小忠林和宝兰开玩笑说：“大姐，你来后咱家都变样了。”宝兰不在意地说：“怎么变样啦？”小忠林说：“怎不变样啦，新媳妇来了，把屋子收拾得变样啦！”说完就笑着跑出去了。
    宝兰不仅积极干家里的活儿，还参加了互助组，妇女们选她当小组长。宝兰参加小组后，用任忠昌的二弟忠和的名字给任忠昌写信，把家里情况告诉他。信最后还说：宝兰也来咱家了。
    不久，任忠昌从前方给他二弟回信说：“我接到家里来的信，知道代耕地搞得很好，很高兴，就是我在家也不一定干得这样好。”他还说：“宝兰不会来的，她家也没有人，再说也没结婚，人家不能来。你撒谎。”
    宝兰在旁边听念信，心里想：啊，你还不相信我呢，谁还能欺骗你！明天我上街去照张像片给你邮去，看你相信不相信。
    虽然任忠昌在前方，丁宝兰在后方，两个人不在一起，但是，他们在信上说的话比他们住在一起时说的还要多得多。丁宝兰把每一段生产做完就给任忠昌去信，任忠昌接信后，马上就把他在前方打仗和学习的情况告诉她。他们互相鼓励着多打死美国鬼子，多生产粮食。
    在种完大田，铲完头遍麦后，丁宝兰给任忠昌去了一封很生动的信。信上写道：“咱们的地种得很好，上的满粪，现在小苗都出齐啦，长的肥头大耳的，小麦也铲完了头遍啦。我们妇女小组十二人有九个下地的，打槎子，拣槎子，种地时扶拉子，头遍麦子都是我们妇女铲的。我当了妇女生产小组长。春耕中，我们小组评上模范组，我还参加了县的劳动模范会。开劳动模范会时，正赶上志愿军归国代表和朝鲜访华代表也在县上，听了他们的报告，也就知道你们的情况了。我还给他们绣了两条手巾：一条给志愿军的，上边绣着：‘献给我敬爱的人’，一条给人民军的，绣的是‘中朝友谊’。”宝兰在信上告诉忠昌：“多杀美国鬼子，立功吧！”
    任忠昌接到丁宝兰的信，马上回了信。他告诉宝兰，他们正在学习速成识字法呢，学会了看书、写字就不困难啦。他还说光荣的抗美援朝纪念章已经发下来了。他希望宝兰也争取更大光荣。
    从这次任忠昌来信后，丁宝兰的生产情绪就更高了。打完场后，宝兰又给任忠昌写了封信，告诉他家里丰收的情况。她写道：“今年是丰收年，平均一垧地打七石粮呢，全组完成生产计划啦。咱家不仅把过去的欠账还了，还买了五十多尺布，十多斤棉花，我们都穿上新棉衣啦。剩下的粮食准备明年卖了买个马，并且把房子修理修理。这次我向你挑战，我希望你在前方是英雄，我在后方是模范，看谁先当上。”
    不久，任忠昌的回信又来了，信上还画了几个和平鸽子和几朵红花。他在信上感谢宝兰照顾了家，并且说：“我向你应战，要多杀美国鬼子，争取当上英雄”。
