Xinhua News Agency, February 17th: To realize its conspiracy of "using Asians to fight Asians," American imperialism is intensifying its plans to train and equip Asian puppet armies to use them for new aggression in the Far East.

According to the "New York Times," the United States is formulating long-term plans to train and equip the ground forces of its "Asian allies." The "New York Times" stated that the U.S. government has conducted "detailed studies" of the manpower situation in the Kuomintang bandit gang, Japan, the Philippines, and Thailand. The results of the study show that in these countries, "relatively few people of conscription age actually take up arms." The "New York Times" dares not face the fact that Asian people oppose war, attributing this to "mainly a lack of equipment and proper training." The newspaper said that the Eisenhower government believes that the United States, "as long as it supplies weapons and advisors," can turn these puppet armies into a "powerful force" for American aggression in the Far East. "Once a major war breaks out, they can take on the responsibility of fighting on the Asian continent, allowing the American army to extricate itself and concentrate its forces in Europe."

To implement this plan to arm puppet armies, the U.S. government recently dispatched George H. Olmsted, Director of the Office of Military Assistance in the U.S. Department of Defense, to the Far East to carry out conspiratorial activities. According to Agence France-Presse, his mission is to "investigate the military strength and needs of various Asian countries resisting communism." Olmsted arrived in Taiwan on the 6th and held talks with the Kuomintang bandit gang and Chase, the head of the U.S. military advisory group stationed in Taiwan. Reuters reported that the Kuomintang bandit gang gave Olmsted "a complete inventory of the Kuomintang's weapons and equipment, as well as its ability to take defensive actions." Olmsted left Taiwan for the Philippines on the 8th. Before his arrival in the Philippines, Richard Partridge, Chief of Intelligence of the U.S. Army, and nine senior officials from the Intelligence Office traveled from Washington to Manila and held secret meetings with senior defense officials of the Philippines. After Olmsted arrived in Manila, sources close to the Philippine Army Headquarters revealed, according to Agence France-Presse, that the U.S. Department of Defense had notified the Philippines to send a regiment of combat troops to Korea, with logistical support provided by the United States. Olmsted held secret talks with Philippine President Quirino and others, and discussed the military assistance needed by the Philippines with U.S. Ambassador to the Philippines Spruance and the head of the U.S. military delegation to the Philippines, Pearson. Agence France-Presse pointed out that Olmsted's activities from Taiwan to the Philippines "show that the United States has begun to implement President Eisenhower's plan to train and equip the armies of Asian allies, including the Philippines, to resist the communists." After ending his activities in the Philippines, Olmsted traveled to Saigon on the 12th to visit the Bao Dai puppet government of Vietnam. According to Agence France-Presse, he went there to "investigate the military equipment needed by Indochina this year and the methods of transporting this equipment."

At the same time, the United States is directing these puppet regimes to strengthen their military ties in order to lay the foundation for the unified use of their armies in the future. Under American direction, the Kuomintang bandit gang's air force recently visited the Philippines. The Kuomintang bandit gang is also preparing to send a military delegation to South Korea. According to Agence France-Presse, the military delegation will discuss military issues related to ensuring the "security" of these puppet regimes with the Syngman Rhee bandit gang.

In addition, French Marshal Juin, who serves as Commander of the Central European Theater of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, recently accepted an invitation from U.S. Far East Commander Clark to visit Korea for inspection. According to United Press, "reliable sources" in Washington revealed that Juin's visit to Korea was to "establish valuable ties between the Bao Dai puppet regime in Vietnam and the Syngman Rhee bandit gang, in order to exchange views on the training methods of the two countries' armies, and to enable senior military officers of the two countries to understand each other's strategic responsibilities and plans to be carried out." These people in Washington anticipate that the military liaison established between the Bao Dai puppet army and the Syngman Rhee puppet army may later be expanded to include the armies of other Asian countries, including the Philippines. After visiting South Korea, Juin will return to Vietnam to inspect the French colonial army. According to United Press, Juin "will study the possibility of replacing French troops with Vietnamese troops." It is quite clear that Juin's trip to Korea is to follow the orders of the American master, imitating the American method of training the Syngman Rhee puppet army, to train more Bao Dai puppet troops to be substitutes for the French colonial army.

This conspiracy of American imperialism to make Asians kill each other will inevitably be strongly opposed by the Asian people and will ultimately fail.

### 妄图实现“用亚洲人打亚洲人”的阴谋  美国加紧策划训练和装备亚洲傀儡军队

    妄图实现“用亚洲人打亚洲人”的阴谋
    美国加紧策划训练和装备亚洲傀儡军队
     【新华社十七日讯】美帝国主义为了实现它的“用亚洲人打亚洲人”的阴谋，正在加紧策划训练和装备亚洲的傀儡军队，以便利用它们在远东进行新的侵略。
    据“纽约时报”报道，美国正在制订长远的计划，来训练并装备美国的“亚洲盟国”的地面部队。“纽约时报”说，美国政府已经对国民党匪帮、日本、菲律宾和泰国的人力情况“作了详尽的研究”，研究的结果说明，在这些国家内“到了服役年龄的人真正拿起枪杆的人是比较少的”。“纽约时报”不敢正视亚洲人民反对战争的事实，而把这归因于“主要是由于缺乏装备和适当的训练”。该报说，艾森豪威尔政府相信，美国“只要供应武器和顾问”，就能把这些傀儡军队变成美国在远东进行侵略的“强大力量”。“一旦大战发生，它们就能负担起在亚洲大陆作战的责任，而使美国军队能够脱身，把力量集中在欧洲”。
    为了实现这个武装傀儡军队的计划，美国政府最近派遣了美国国防部军援局局长乔治·赫·奥姆斯特德前来远东进行阴谋活动。据法新社报道，他的任务是“考察对抗共产主义的各亚洲国家的军事力量和需要”。奥姆斯特德在六日到达台湾，和国民党匪帮以及美国驻台湾的军事顾问团团长蔡斯举行了会谈，路透社报道说，国民党匪帮曾交给奥姆斯特德“一份国民党的武器和装备以及采取防御行动的实力的全部表册”。奥姆斯特德在八日离台湾前往菲律宾。在他到达菲律宾以前，美国陆军情报处处长理查德·帕特里奇和情报处的九名高级官员由华盛顿前往马尼拉，和菲律宾的高级国防官员举行秘密会议。在奥姆斯特德到马尼拉以后，据法新社报道，接近菲律宾陆军总部的人就透露：美国国防部通知菲律宾，要菲律宾派遣一个团的战斗部队到朝鲜去，而由美国给予后勤支援。奥姆斯特德和菲律宾总统季里诺等举行了秘密会谈，并和美国驻菲律宾大使斯普鲁恩斯、美国驻菲律宾军事代表团团长皮尔逊等讨论了菲律宾所需要的军事援助。法新社指出，奥姆斯特德从台湾到菲律宾进行活动，
    “显示美国已在着手执行艾森豪威尔总统的训练和装备包括菲律宾在内的亚洲盟国的军队以抗击共产党人的计划”。奥姆斯特德结束他在菲律宾的活动以后，已在十二日前往西贡，访问越南的保大傀儡政府，据法新社报道，他是去“考察印度支那今年所需要的军事装备和运输这些装备的方法”的。
    与此同时，美国正在指使这些傀儡政权之间加强军事上的联系，以便为将来统一使用它们的军队打下基础。在美国导演之下，国民党匪帮的空军在不久以前访问了菲律宾。国民党匪帮最近还准备派遣一个军事代表团前往南朝鲜。据法新社透露，这个军事代表团将和李承晚匪帮讨论有关保证这些傀儡政权“安全”的军事问题。
    此外，担任北大西洋侵略集团中欧区陆军司令的法国元帅许温，最近应美国远东总司令克拉克之邀，也准备到朝鲜去进行视察。据合众社报道，华盛顿的“可靠人士”透露，许温到朝鲜去是为了在越南保大傀儡政权和李承晚匪帮之间“建立宝贵的联系，以便对两国军队的训练方法交换意见，并使两国军队的高级军官能够互相了解在战略上所负的责任以及所要进行的计划”。华盛顿的这些人士预料，在保大伪军和李承晚伪军之间所建立的军事联络，以后还可能扩大到包括菲律宾在内的其他亚洲国家的军队。许温在访问南朝鲜之后，将回到越南视察法国殖民军队。据合众社报道，许温“将研究用越南军队代替法军的可能性”。十分明显，许温的朝鲜之行，就是要遵照美国主子的命令，仿效美国训练李承晚伪军的办法，来训练更多的保大伪军给法国殖民军队做替死鬼。
    美帝国主义这种企图使亚洲人自相残杀的阴谋，必然要遭到亚洲人民的强烈反对而最后归于失败。
