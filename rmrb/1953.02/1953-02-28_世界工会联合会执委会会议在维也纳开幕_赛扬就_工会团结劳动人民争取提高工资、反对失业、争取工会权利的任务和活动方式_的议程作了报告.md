Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, February 27th: According to TASS, the Executive Committee meeting of the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) opened in Vienna on the 25th. Representatives from trade union organizations in France, Italy, the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, the Netherlands, Czechoslovakia, India, the German Democratic Republic, Poland, Romania, Lebanon, Australia, Hungary, Luxembourg, Iran, Belgium, the United Kingdom, Finland, Indonesia, Jamaica, Japan, Cuba, Greece, Austria, Mexico, and other countries are participating in the meeting. Representatives from the WFTU's industrial departments and affiliated international trade unions are also attending.

The opening session was presided over by Lombardo Toledano, Vice-President of the WFTU and President of the Confederation of Latin American Workers. At his suggestion, the meeting unanimously decided to send a telegram of greetings to Giuseppe Di Vittorio, President of the WFTU and General Secretary of the Italian General Confederation of Labour, who was unable to attend the meeting due to obstruction by the Italian authorities. The meeting also decided to send a telegram to WFTU Vice-President Benoît Frachon, General Secretary of the French General Confederation of Labour, expressing that the working class of the whole world will certainly be able to secure his freedom. The meeting also sent a protest telegram to the French government demanding the immediate release of Frachon.

The agenda of the meeting is as follows:

1.  The tasks and methods of trade unions in uniting working people to fight for higher wages, against unemployment, and for trade union rights.
2.  Convening the Third Congress of the World Federation of Trade Unions.
3.  The decisions of the World People's Peace Congress and the role that trade unions should play in implementing these decisions.
4.  Strengthening the struggle of agricultural workers to demand improved living and working conditions and the support of trade unions for their economic and social demands.
5.  Settlement of the 1952 budget and adoption of the 1953 budget.

Louis Saillant, General Secretary of the WFTU, reported on the first item on the agenda. He said: The capitalist countries' pushing the economy onto a war track has drastically worsened the material conditions of the working people. The purchasing power of the people is declining year by year, taxes are constantly increasing, and real wages are sharply reduced. According to official figures, from 1950 to the first quarter of 1952, the minimum cost of living in France rose by 32.4 percent, in the United Kingdom by 17 percent, and in the United States by 10 percent. The number of unemployed in capitalist countries has soared. Enterprises in peaceful industries are either closing down or can only maintain semi-operation. But in the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies, they have never known any economic crisis, and their economic development is entirely to ensure the maximum satisfaction of the material and cultural needs of the working people.

Louis Saillant spoke in detail about the struggles of the working people in capitalist countries, colonies, and semi-colonies for their rights, and the persecution by the governments of these countries of fighters for freedom and national independence. He said: Attacks on the rights and freedoms of the people and trade unions are becoming increasingly rampant. Prominent facts in this regard include the arrest of Benoît Frachon, the assassination of trade union leaders and activists in Tunisia, Morocco, and Kenya, the persecution of trade union leaders in West Germany, the closure of the Uruguayan trade union organization in September 1952, and the arrest of more than 600 workers and trade union leaders, etc. But no matter how rampant terror and persecution may be, the people of all countries are rising up more and more resolutely and in an organized way to resist the plans of the American war-makers. This has meant that the Bonn and Paris war treaties, although signed by the relevant governments several months ago, have not yet been ratified.

After exposing the faces of those yellow trade union bosses engaged in divisive activities, Louis Saillant put forward some suggestions aimed at strengthening the struggle of the working people for increased wages, against increasing unemployment, and for trade union rights and democratic freedoms. He specifically suggested that the meeting make a decision to organize an international movement against the infringement of trade union rights by monopoly capitalists.

In conclusion, Louis Saillant called on all working people to strengthen their unity and struggle for peace, national freedom, bread and work, and to expose the yellow trade union bosses – the agents of the American and British monopoly capitalists.

    世界工会联合会执委会会议在维也纳开幕
    赛扬就“工会团结劳动人民争取提高工资、反对失业、争取工会权利的任务和活动方式”的议程作了报告
    【新华社二十七日讯】据塔斯社维也纳讯：世界工会联合会执行委员会会议二十五日在维也纳开幕。参加会议的有法国、意大利、苏联、中华人民共和国、荷兰、捷克斯洛伐克、印度、德意志民主共和国、波兰、罗马尼亚、黎巴嫩、澳大利亚、匈牙利、卢森堡、伊朗、比利时、英国、芬兰、印度尼西亚、牙买加、日本、古巴、希腊、奥地利、墨西哥等国工会组织的代表。世界工联产业部所属各工会国际的代表也参加了会议。
    世界工联副主席、拉丁美洲劳工联盟主席伦巴多·托列达诺主持开幕会议。在他的提议下，会议一致决定打电报给世界工联主席、意大利总工会总书记朱塞佩·维多里奥致敬，他因为意大利当局的阻挠不能出席会议。会议并决定打电报给世界工联副主席、法国总工会总书记勒里普，表示全世界的工人阶级一定能使他获得自由。会议并给法国政府发出了一个抗议电报，要求立刻释放勒里普。
    会议的议程如下：
    一、工会团结劳动人民争取提高工资、反对失业、争取工会权利的任务和活动方式；二、召开世界工联第三次代表大会；三、世界人民和平大会的决定和工会在执行这些决定方面所应起的作用；四、加强农业工人要求改善生活和工作条件的斗争和工会对于他们的经济和社会要求的支持；五、结算一九五二年的预算并通过一九五三年的预算。
    世界工联总书记路易·赛扬就第一项议程作报告。他说：资本主义国家把经济推向战争轨道，已使劳动人民的物质条件急剧恶化。人民的购买力一年年下降，赋税不断增加，实际工资急剧减少。根据官方的数字，从一九五○年到一九五二年第一季度，最低限度生活费用在法国上涨了百分之三十二点四，在英国上涨了百分之十七，在美国上涨了百分之十。资本主义各国的失业人数激增。和平工业的企业不是关门就是只能维持半开工状态。但在苏联和人民民主国家，它们从来不知道什么经济危机，它们的经济发展完全是为了保证最大限度地满足劳动人民的物质和文化的需求。
    路易·赛扬详细谈到资本主义国家、殖民地和半殖民地国家的劳动人民为争取他们的权利所进行的斗争情形，以及这些国家的政府迫害争取自由和民族独立的战士的情形。他说：向人民和工会的权利及自由所作的攻击日益猖狂。这方面突出的事实如勒里普被逮捕，突尼斯、摩洛哥和怯尼亚工会领袖和积极分子遭到暗杀，西德工会领袖遭到迫害，乌拉圭工会机构在一九五二年九月被封闭，六百多工人和工会领袖被逮捕等等。但是无论恐怖和迫害怎样猖狂，各国人民越来越坚决地、有组织地起来反抗美国战争制造者的计划。这使得波恩和巴黎战争条约虽然在好几个月以前就已由有关政府签字，然而迄今还未被批准。
    路易·赛扬在揭发了那些从事于分裂活动的黄色工会头子的面目后，提出了一些目的在于加强劳动人民争取增加工资、反对日益增加的失业、争取工会权利和民主自由的斗争的建议。他特别建议会议作出决定，组织反对垄断资本家侵害工会权利的国际性的运动。
    路易·赛扬在结语中号召所有劳动人民加强团结，为争取和平、民族自由、面包和工作，为揭发黄色工会头子——美英垄断资本家的代理人而斗争。
