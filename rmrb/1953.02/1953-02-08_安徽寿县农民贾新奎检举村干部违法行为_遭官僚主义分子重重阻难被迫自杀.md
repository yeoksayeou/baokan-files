Editor's Note: The suicide of Jia Xinkui, a farmer from Shouxian County, Anhui Province, reflects the serious bureaucratic and sectarian work style of the Anhui Provincial People's Court's Liu'an Branch, the Shouxian County People's Court, and other institutions, which are characterized by disregard for people's complaints, disregard for human life, and biased credulity towards cadres. At the same time, it reflects the serious lack of organization and discipline in these institutions, which show a great disregard for instructions from higher authorities, fail to implement them effectively, or simply do not implement them at all. It is hoped that the Anhui Provincial People's Court will seriously deal with the relevant personnel who are in violation of the law and derelict in their duties in this case.

Jia Xinkui, a farmer from Daying Village, Yaogao Township, Sanhe District, Shouxian County, Liu'an Prefecture, Anhui Province, was subjected to layers of obstruction by bureaucratic elements in the district and township people's governments, and the Shouxian County People's Court, and the Liu'an Branch of the Anhui Provincial People's Court, after reporting the embezzlement and illegal activities of village cadres. He was also subjected to ridicule, threats, and attacks from district cadres and the accused village and township cadres, and was finally forced to commit suicide. The circumstances of the incident are as follows:

During the land reform in Daying Village in December 1951, Yao Ruxue (a Communist Party member), the head of the village administrative group, and Shen Hongjie (who later became the militia squad leader), a farmer representative, distributed land unfairly. They allocated good land to themselves and bad land to others. Jia Xinkui only received three mu of bad land and a dilapidated thatched house, which made him very dissatisfied. Therefore, he joined with 18 other poor and hired farmers in the village, including Shen Chao'an and Shen Songyun, to file a complaint with the district and township people's governments. At that time, Shen Hongjie, Yao Ruxue, and others reported to the district and township people's governments that Jia Xinkui was mentally ill, a former soldier, and instigated by landlords, and that his accusations were not true, in order to cover up their own mistakes. In late January 1952 (during the Lunar New Year), Jia Xinkui saw that the grandmother of his neighbor Yang Jiafang had committed suicide, but the village cadres Shen Hongjie, Yao Ruxue, and others did not care, so he went to the township people's government to report it. This was learned by Shen Chaogang, a confidant of Shen Hongjie, who ran to the township people's government first and falsely reported that Jia was a "madman" and that his report was not true. Then he told Shen Hongjie and Yao Ruxue about it. The Yaogao Township People's Government, listening only to the words of bad elements, never dealt with Jia Xinkui's complaint. Shen Hongjie and Yao Ruxue were very dissatisfied with Jia Xinkui, ridiculing him, saying: "You're ingratiating yourself, but you haven't been rewarded with anything!" "Why didn't they ask you to be a cadre?" After Jia was hit, he went to the Shouxian County People's Court on February 6 to accuse Shen Hongjie and Yao Ruxue, and listed Shen and Yao's illegal acts: Shen Hongjie had embezzled the fruits of the farmers' struggle, falsely reported population to get more land, and shielded his uncle Shen Songyuan from concealing black land; Yao Ruxue had dispersed property for landlords, asked landlords to be cadres to oppress the masses, embezzled public funds, and colluded with Shi Tinggan in an attempt to murder Jia Xinkui. However, the Shouxian County People's Court refused to accept the case, claiming that Jia did not have a letter of introduction. In May, Jia Xinkui went to the Liu'an Branch of the Anhui Provincial People's Court to complain. Chen, the deputy director of the Liu'an Branch, did not go through the county and district governments, but wrote directly to Shen Songjiang, the instructor of Yaogao Township (Shen Hongjie's uncle), ordering him to handle the matter carefully, and then did not ask about it again. However, Hu Yongsheng, the head of Yaogao Township, and Shen Songjiang, the instructor, still believed that Jia Xinkui was mentally ill and ignored him. In June 1952, Jia Xinkui went to the Nanjing Municipal People's Court to complain. Because the Nanjing Municipal People's Court had no leadership relationship with the Shouxian County People's Court, it wrote a letter introducing Jia Xinkui to return to the Shouxian County Court to complain. The letter also pointed out the error of the Shouxian County People's Court in not accepting cases without a letter of introduction. Jia Xinkui went home to harvest his crops, and on September 3, he went to the Supreme People's Court in Beijing to appeal. The Supreme People's Court prepared a formal document, put forward specific handling opinions, and handed it to Jia Xinkui to take back to the Shouxian County People's Government for handling, and asked the Shouxian County People's Government to report the handling results. Zhang Yulin, the secretary of the Shouxian County People's Government, received the document from the Supreme People's Court, but did not consider the seriousness of the problem, nor did he study the instructions of the Supreme People's Court carefully. He simply wrote "Handed over to the court for handling" and pushed it to the county people's court for handling. Afterwards, he neither urged the matter nor checked on it. The county people's court still did not pay much attention to this matter. It did not send personnel to investigate in depth and handle it carefully according to the spirit of the instructions of the Supreme People's Court. It only wrote a letter asking the district people's government to understand the situation and ordered Jia Xinkui to return to his hometown to await summons. At this time, the district chief of Sanhe District had resigned to recuperate, and the district party secretary was also about to resign to study, so the case was handed over to Wang Yinhe, the district party committee's organization member, to handle. However, Wang Yinhe did not conduct an investigation, nor did he report back to the court. On September 25, the county court summoned Shen Hongjie, Yao Ruxue, and Jia Xinkui for the first time for trial. The trial confirmed the illegal acts of the village cadres accused by Jia Xinkui. Except for the attempted murder, which was still to be investigated, the others were all facts. However, Luo Benduan, the court's trial officer, still did not point out the mistakes of Shen Hongjie and Yao Ruxue's embezzlement and illegal activities. He simply ordered them to return to their hometown to be dealt with after it was confirmed whether the attempted murder was true. This not only failed to support Jia Xinkui's correct actions, but also fueled the arrogance of the illegal elements. On the way home, Shen Hongjie said to Yao Ruxue: "This time, we must put Lao Jia under control when we go back." After returning to the village, Shen Hongjie often insulted Jia Xinkui. Jia Xinkui wrote another letter to the Supreme People's Court, requesting support. The Supreme People's Court wrote another letter to the Shouxian County People's Court, instructing the county court to deal with it promptly. On October 27, when the Shouxian County People's Court summoned him for the second time, the case had been taken to Sanhe District by the case-clearing team, so the court told Jia to go to the district to await handling. Liu Mengping, the civil affairs assistant of the district, did not ask about the facts, but rudely pointed at Jia and said: "This is the guy who makes false accusations. He's the one who sued all the way to Beijing. He's a madman, and everything he accuses is untrue. He's completely being used by the landlords." Jiang Zhanying, the district party committee secretary, had just returned from studying not long ago. He did not understand the situation, nor did he ask about it, and blindly criticized Jia Xinkui. When the case-clearing team studied the division of labor under the leadership of the district party committee, they asked Liu Mengping, the civil affairs assistant, to go to Yaogao Township to clear the backlog of cases. After Liu Mengping arrived in the township, he still adopted the method of sitting in court to hear cases, writing summonses to summon Jia Xinkui and others, and handing the summonses to Chen Tongxiu, the director of the village farmers' association (who was on good terms with Shen Hongjie), to take them. Chen did not hand the summons directly to Jia Xinkui, but handed it to Shen Hongjie's younger brother to take it back to Shen Hongjie. Shen Hongjie threatened Jia Xinkui with the summons, saying: "Lao Jia! You sue to the south and sue to the north, but now you're back in my hands again? The higher-ups told me to control you. Look! Isn't this a control ticket!" Jia Xinkui believed it was true, was very angry about this matter, and felt that he had run to many places for nearly a year to report bad people, but the problem had never been resolved. Instead, he was going to be put under control. In grief and indignation, he hanged himself to death on November 10. After the villagers discovered that Jia had hanged himself, they wanted to let Jia down, but Shen Hongjie said hatefully: "Why loosen him? If he likes to hang, let him hang for a while longer!"

After Liu Mengping, the civil affairs assistant of the district, issued the summons, he did not see the summoned person appear in court, nor did he pursue the matter. It was not until Jia had committed suicide that he discovered that the case file was still in his pocket untouched. Yang Heng, the deputy district chief of Sanhe District, did not conduct an in-depth investigation or pursue responsibility after hearing the news of Jia Xinkui's suicide. He opposed the district party committee secretary, saying: "It doesn't matter whether you report it early or late. Doesn't the county still base its decision on the district's opinion?" Finally, although he reported to the higher authorities, he still falsely accused Jia Xinkui in the report as being of soldier-bandit origin, instigated by landlords, and committing suicide because he was ridiculed by landlords.

After this incident occurred, the Liu'an Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Liu'an Prefectural Administration sent people to the local area twice, together with the Shouxian County People's Government, to conduct investigations. They clarified the reasons for Jia Xinkui's suicide and confirmed the illegal activities of the village cadres reported by Jia Xinkui. Except for the attempted murder, which could not be confirmed, the rest were all facts. The Liu'an Prefectural Administration has now ordered the Shouxian County People's Court to arrest Shen Hongjie, and the punishment of the relevant officials who violated the law and derelicted their duties in the county, district, township, and village is also being studied.

    安徽寿县农民贾新奎检举村干部违法行为
    遭官僚主义分子重重阻难被迫自杀
    编者按：安徽寿县农民贾新奎被迫自杀的事件，反映出安徽省人民法院六安分院、寿县人民法院等机关存在着漠视人民控告、漠视人民生命、对干部偏听偏信的严重官僚主义和宗派主义作风；同时反映出这些机关存在着对上级的指示极不重视、执行不力或根本不执行的严重无组织无纪律现象。希望安徽省人民法院对本案有关的违法失职人员，进行严肃处理。
    安徽省六安专区寿县三和区姚皋乡大郢村农民贾新奎为检举村干部贪污违法行为，先后受到区、乡人民政府和寿县人民法院、安徽省人民法院六安分院官僚主义分子层层阻难，又遭区干部和被检举的乡村干部讽刺、威胁和打击，最后竟被迫自杀身死。事件经过情形如下：
    一九五一年十二月，大郢村土地改革时，该村行政组长姚如学（共产党员）、农民代表沈宏杰（以后又当了民兵班长）分配土地不公，自己分到的地又多又好，把坏地分给别人，贾新奎只分到三亩坏地和破草房一间，因此非常不满，遂与同村贫、雇农沈朝安、沈颂云等十八人联名向区、乡人民政府提出控告。当时沈宏杰、姚如学等即向区、乡人民政府反映贾新奎有疯病，是兵痞，受地主指使，所控不是事实，用以掩饰自己的错误。一九五二年一月下旬（农历年节），贾新奎看到邻居杨家芳的祖母自杀，而村干部沈宏杰、姚如学等不加过问，遂又去乡人民政府报告。事被沈宏杰的亲信沈朝刚得知，沈朝刚即先跑到乡人民政府，谎报贾是“疯子”，报告的不是事实。接着又把这事告诉沈宏杰和姚如学。姚皋乡乡人民政府片面听信坏分子的话，对贾新奎的检举始终未作处理。沈宏杰、姚如学则对贾新奎非常不满，讽刺贾说：“你献殷勤也没见赏你个啥！”“怎没叫你当干部？”贾受打击后，又于二月六日到寿县人民法院控告沈宏杰、姚如学，并列举了沈、姚的违法行为：沈宏杰曾贪污农民斗争果实，假报人口多分田，包庇叔父沈颂远隐瞒黑田；姚如学曾替地主分散财产，叫地主当干部欺压群众，贪污公款，并伙同石庭干企图谋杀贾新奎。但是寿县人民法院竟借口贾没有介绍信，未予受理。五月间，贾新奎又到安徽省人民法院六安分院控告。六安分院陈副院长没有通过县、区两级政府，就直接写信给姚皋乡乡指导员沈颂江（沈宏杰的叔父），令其慎重处理，以后即未过问。但姚皋乡乡长胡永盛、指导员沈颂江仍认为贾新奎有疯病，未予理睬。一九五二年六月，贾新奎又到南京市人民法院控告。南京市人民法院因与寿县人民法院没有领导关系，遂写信介绍贾新奎仍回寿县法院控告。信中并指出寿县人民法院无介绍信不受理案件的错误。贾新奎回家收割了庄稼，九月三日又到北京最高人民法院申诉。最高人民法院即备正式公文，提出具体处理意见，交贾新奎带回交寿县人民政府处理，并叫寿县人民政府回报处理结果。寿县人民政府秘书张玉林接到最高人民法院公文，既不考虑问题的严重性，也没有很好地研究最高人民法院的指示，即批上
    “交法院处理”五个字，推到县人民法院去处理。事后既未催办，也未检查。县人民法院对此事仍极不重视，没有根据最高人民法院指示的精神派员深入了解，慎重处理，仅写信叫区人民政府了解情况，并令贾新奎回乡听候传讯。这时三和区区长已离职去养病，区委书记也正要离职去学习，此案遂交由区委组织委员王银和办理。但王银和并没有进行调查，也没有向法院回报。九月二十五日，县法院第一次传沈宏杰、姚如学和贾新奎等审讯，审讯证实了贾新奎所控告的村干部违法行为，除企图谋杀一事尚待查明外，其他均系事实。但是法院审判人员罗本端仍没有指出沈宏杰、姚如学贪污违法的错误，即仍令回乡，待查明企图谋杀一事是否确实后再处理。这样不仅没有支持贾新奎的正确行动，反助长了违法分子的气焰。沈宏杰在回家的路上即向姚如学说：“这次回去一定要把老贾管制起来。”回村后，沈宏杰仍时常辱骂贾新奎。贾新奎又写信给最高人民法院，请求支持，最高人民法院再写信给寿县人民法院，指示县法院迅速处理。十月二十七日，寿县人民法院第二次传讯时，该案已由清理积案小组带往三和区，法院遂叫贾到区听候处理。区民政助理员刘孟平不问事实，就粗暴地指着贾说：
    “就是这家伙胡告，告到北京的就是他。他是疯子，告的全不是事实，完全是受地主利用。”该区区委书记江占英刚离职学习回来不久，既不了解情况，也不加询问，即盲目地也批评了贾新奎。清理积案小组在区委领导下研究分工时，又叫民政助理员刘孟平到姚皋乡去清理积案。刘孟平到乡后仍采取坐堂问案的方式，写传票传讯贾新奎等，并把传票交给村农会主任陈同秀（和沈宏杰相好）带去。陈没有把传票直接交给贾新奎，反交给沈宏杰的弟弟带回给了沈宏杰。沈宏杰拿着传票威胁贾新奎说：“老贾！你告到南告到北，现在不又告到我手里来了？上级叫我管制你，看！这不是管制票！”贾新奎信以为真，对此事非常愤懑，感到自己为检举坏人，跑了许多地方，历时近一年，问题始终未得解决，反而要受管制，悲愤之下，于十一月十日上吊自杀身死。该村群众发现贾吊死后，要把贾放下来，沈宏杰还恨恨地说：“松他干啥？他爱吊让他再吊一时！”
    区民政助理员刘孟平发出传票后，未见被传的人到案，也不加追究，直到贾已自杀，才发现案卷仍放在腰里未动。三和区副区长杨衡听到贾新奎自杀的消息后，也不深入调查，追究责任，报请上级处理，反对区委书记说：“早报迟报，县还不是根据区的意见吗？”最后虽向上级作了报告，但在报告里却仍诬说贾新奎是兵痞出身，受地主指使，是受地主讽刺而自杀的。
    这一事件发生后，中共六安地委、六安专署曾先后两次派人会同寿县人民政府到当地进行调查，查清了贾新奎自杀的原因，并证实了贾新奎所检举的村干部的违法行为，除谋杀一事尚不能肯定外，其余全部是事实。现六安专署已令寿县人民法院将沈宏杰逮捕，对县、区、乡、村有关的违法失职干部的处分也正研究中。（胡振岳）
