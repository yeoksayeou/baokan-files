Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, February 8th: The CCP Central Committee's Central-South Bureau convened its second Factory and Mining Work Conference from January 15th to 26th. This conference focused on reviewing the basic construction work of the past period and discussing and deploying future basic construction tasks and enterprise production reform work.

The conference decided to concentrate efforts on strengthening leadership over basic construction. To this end, the CCP Central Committee's Central-South Bureau has decided to organize a Basic Construction Committee and plans to convene various meetings soon to study the Party's organizational and propaganda work in basic construction. To strengthen the Party's leadership in basic construction, the Central-South Bureau decided to transfer a large number of Party member cadres at or above the county level from rural areas to industrial construction departments starting in April, of which approximately 80 percent will be sent to basic construction departments. At the same time, in existing state-owned, locally state-owned, and joint state-private large and small factories and mines, a large number of technical cadres and skilled workers will be systematically trained and sent to basic construction and newly built factories and mines.

The conference decided to seize the opportunity to carry out production reform work in factories and mining enterprises. The specific requirements are that from January to April, all factories and mines should vigorously promote advanced working methods and formulate average advanced quotas on the basis of the original production reform. It is also required that all state-owned factories and key local state-owned factories and mines in the region complete production reform work by September this year, in order to gradually implement the economic accounting system. The conference pointed out that in promoting advanced production methods, the experience of Factory 53 and the management method of "organizing rhythmic production according to instruction charts" should also be vigorously promoted. Fundamentally solve the problem of leadership lagging behind the masses and administrative management lagging behind production management.

Finally, Comrade Li Xuefeng of the CCP Central Committee's Central-South Bureau made a concluding report. He said: After more than three years, the Central-South region has completed the historical tasks of great social reform and restoring the national economy. The focus of the entire region's work must resolutely shift to large-scale construction centered on industrial construction. It would be a political mistake to show hesitation in the face of new historical tasks. In his report, he also focused on criticizing several erroneous attitudes taken by some cadres towards large-scale economic construction. One is pushing back many tasks that should and could be done, which is a passive and slack attitude; another is the erroneous idea that since basic construction is very important, production can be ignored; and another is the dependent mentality of not wanting to rely on one's own efforts, not considering actual needs, and using "sky-high prices" to ask the leadership organs for too many cadres. Li Xuefeng finally called on everyone to be determined to delve into it and constantly improve their ideological and work levels. He pointed out that many of the comrades we have sent to work in factories and mines in the past have delved into it very well and are very determined, but this is not common enough or solid enough, and some people have not delved into it for a long time, or are not prepared to delve into it at all. In addition, some leading cadres of factories and mines have long allowed unreformed old technicians to make false accounts or not keep accounts to the state, showing "ignorance, parochialism, and bureaucracy." These phenomena cannot be tolerated. Li Xuefeng finally said: "At a time when the country is beginning to carry out large-scale economic construction, we must resolutely wage a serious struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and all kinds of illegal and undisciplined behaviors."

    中共中央中南局召开厂矿工作会议
    布置基本建设任务和企业的生产改革工作
    【新华社武汉八日电】中共中央中南局在一月十五日到二十六日召开了第二次厂矿工作会议。这次会议着重检查了过去一个时期的基本建设工作，讨论与布置了今后基本建设任务和企业的生产改革工作。
    会议决定集中力量加强对基本建设的领导。为此，中共中央中南局已决定组织一个基本建设委员会，计划于最近召开各种会议，研究党在基本建设方面的组织、宣传等工作。为了加强党在基本建设方面的领导，中南局决定四月开始从农村抽调大批县级以上的党员干部转到工业建设部门，其中将有百分之八十左右输送到基本建设部门。同时在现有国营、地方国营以及公私合营的大小厂矿中，有计划地培养大批技术干部和技术工人，输送到基本建设和新建厂矿中去。
    会议决定抓紧时机进行厂矿企业的生产改革工作。具体要求从一月到四月，各厂矿在原有生产改革的基础上，大力推广先进工作方法，制订平均先进定额。并要求全区国营厂矿和地方国营主要厂矿，到今年九月份全部完成生产改革工作，以便逐步实行经济核算制。会议指出在推广先进生产方法中，同时要大力推广五三工厂的经验和“按指示图表组织有节奏生产”的管理方法。从根本上解决领导落后于群众、行政管理落后于生产管理的问题。
    会议最后由中共中央中南局李雪峰同志做总结报告。他说：经过三年多的时间，中南区已经完成了伟大的社会改革和恢复国民经济的历史任务。全区的工作中心必须坚决地转到以工业建设为中心的大规模建设中去。如果在新的历史任务面前表示犹豫，将会犯政治性的错误。他在报告中还着重批判了某些干部对大规模经济建设采取的几种错误态度。一种是把许多应该办而且办得到的任务往后推，这是消极怠工思想；一种是认为既然基本建设很重要，生产就可以不管的错误思想；另一种是不想自力更生，不考虑实际需要，而用“漫天要价”的手段向领导机关要过多干部的依赖思想。李雪峰最后号召大家决心钻进去，不断地提高自己的思想水平和工作水平。他指出我们过去派到工厂矿山去工作的同志，已经有许多人钻得很好，决心很大，但是还不够普遍，不够巩固，甚至有的人长期没有钻进去，或者根本就不准备钻进去。另外，有的厂矿领导干部长期听任没有改造好的旧技术人员向国家造假帐或不算帐，表现得“又无知，又本位，又官僚主义”。这些现象是决不能容忍的。李雪峰最后说：“在国家正在开始进行大规模经济建设的时候，必须坚决向官僚主义、命令主义和各种各样的违法乱纪的行为作严肃的斗争。”
