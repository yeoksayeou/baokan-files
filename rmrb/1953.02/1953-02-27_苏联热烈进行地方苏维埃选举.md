Xinhua News Agency dispatch: According to TASS news: The people of seven Soviet republics, including the Russian Federation, Ukraine, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova, Lithuania, and Estonia, enthusiastically conducted elections for local Soviets in various regions, states, autonomous regions, districts, cities, and villages on the 22nd. The elections vividly demonstrated the political and spiritual unity of the Soviet people.

    In the Russian Federation, from the Pacific coast to the Baltic Sea coast, from the Arctic Ocean to the Caucasus, a festive atmosphere prevailed everywhere. People of all ethnic groups enthusiastically participated in the elections. At six o'clock in the morning, when the Kremlin chimes were broadcast from the loudspeakers of the polling stations, the elections began in Moscow, Leningrad, Voronezh, Stalingrad, and other regions of the central part of the republic. The richly decorated polling stations were crowded with thousands of voters. At this time, it was already noon in the Soviet Far East, and most voters had already cast their ballots. In the city and region of Leningrad, the election was basically over by 2 p.m. Most voters cast their ballots in the early morning. In the city of Stalingrad, residents flocked to the polling stations to vote. The working people of many newly established cities, residential areas, and villages participated in their first vote in this election. For example, during the previous local Soviet election two years ago, the Zhiguli area where the Kuibyshev Hydropower Station was being built was still a wilderness. Now, a Communist Youth League residential area has sprung up there, and a new electoral district of the Kuibyshev Oblast Soviet has been established. The elections were also solemnly conducted in various autonomous republics and national districts. In each electoral district where Stalin was a candidate, the atmosphere was particularly enthusiastic, and voters proudly voted for their beloved leader and standard-bearer of peace, Stalin.

    In the other six union republics, the local Soviet elections also vividly demonstrated the political and spiritual unity of the people. The election in Ukraine became a national celebration. In cities such as Kiev, Kharkov, Odessa, and Rovno, and in all villages, most voters had cast their ballots before noon. Residents of the young city of New Kakhovka held their first election for the city soviet. In urban and rural areas throughout the Belarusian Republic, enthusiastic election activities were underway. In Minsk, the capital of the republic, portraits of Lenin and Stalin and colorful flags hung in front of all buildings and on the scaffolding of new buildings, setting off the city's rebuilt wide streets, beautiful squares, and graceful architectural complexes, making them look exceptionally beautiful. In Georgia, Moldova, and Lithuania, voters gathered with excitement at the festively decorated polling stations, electing their beloved representatives to the local organs of power. In Vilnius, the capital of the Lithuanian Republic, voters had gathered in front of the polling stations before the morning mist enveloped Gediminas Hill. Female worker B. Smelytė told a TASS reporter after voting: The people of our republic are celebrating election day with the achievements of labor. We vote for our best representatives for the sake of communism and world peace.

Xinhua News Agency dispatch: TASS, Moscow: Moscow voters enthusiastically held elections for the Moscow Oblast, city, and district local Soviets on the 22nd. The whole city presented a festive atmosphere that day. The streets were filled with bright flags, slogans, and colorful lights, and people were dressed in festive costumes, happily rushing to the polling stations to vote.

    In the early morning, as early as before six o'clock, hundreds of people gathered in front of the First Polling Station of the Stalin Electoral District, where J.V. Stalin was a candidate for the Moscow Soviet. At six o'clock, the Kremlin chimes were broadcast from the loudspeakers, and the election began. Election Committee Chairman V. Abakumov warmly congratulated the voters and invited them to start voting. Then, voters cast their ballots in a steady stream, and many people proudly voted for the great standard-bearer of peace—Stalin. By noon, all voters in the district had cast their ballots. In the forty-eight newly established electoral districts, people also enthusiastically participated in the elections. During the election process, they were all convinced that the candidates of the Stalin party and non-party alliance—the best men and women of their hometown, those who spared no effort to make the Soviet capital more beautiful and more perfect—would not betray their deep trust.

    Muscovites nominated the leader and mentor of the Soviet people, J.V. Stalin, as their first candidate. Among the other candidates were leaders of the Communist Party and the Soviet government, seventy-four Stalin Prize winners, and thirty-two Heroes of the Soviet Union and Heroes of Socialist Labor.

    In the evening, songs and music echoed in the streets hung with red flags. The election committee will open the ballot boxes at midnight, count the votes, and announce the names of the seven thousand representatives elected by Muscovites to the city and district Soviets.

    苏联热烈进行地方苏维埃选举
    据新华社讯：据塔斯社消息：苏联俄罗斯联邦、乌克兰、白俄罗斯、格鲁吉亚、摩尔达维亚、立陶宛和爱沙尼亚等七个加盟共和国的人民，已在二十二日热烈进行各边疆区、州、专区、区、市镇、乡村等地方苏维埃的选举。各地的选举生动地显示了苏联人民在政治上和精神上的团结一致。
    在俄罗斯联邦，从太平洋沿岸到波罗的海海岸，从北冰洋到高加索，到处洋溢着节日气氛。各族人民都热情地参加了选举。清晨六时，当选举站的扩音器传出了克里姆林宫的钟声的时候，莫斯科、列宁格勒、佛罗内兹、斯大林格勒和共和国中部各州其他地区的选举就开始了。装璜富丽的选举站上拥挤着成千成百的选民。在这个时候，苏维埃远东已经是正午时分，大多数选民已经投完了票。在列宁格勒市和州，选举到下午二时就基本结束。大部分选民在清晨就投完了票。在斯大林格勒市，居民们成群结队地到选举站投了票。许多新建立的城市、居民区和乡村的劳动人民在这一届选举中，开始了第一次投票。例如，在两年前上届地方苏维埃选举的时候，兴建古比雪夫水电站电力厂的日古尔地区还是一片荒地。现在那里兴起了青年团居民区，成立了古比雪夫州苏维埃的新选区。在各自治共和国和民族区，选举也隆重地进行。在各个以斯大林为候选人的选区里，人们的情绪特别热烈，选民们怀着骄傲的心情投票选举他们敬爱的领袖、和平旗手斯大林。
    在其他六个加盟共和国中，地方苏维埃的选举也生动地显示了人民群众政治上和精神上的团结一致。乌克兰的选举成了举国欢庆的节日。在基辅、哈尔科夫、敖德萨、罗夫等城市和所有乡村中，大多数选民在正午以前都投完了票。年青的新卡霍夫卡城的居民，举行了他们第一届市苏维埃的选举。白俄罗斯共和国的城乡各地都展开了热烈的选举活动。共和国首都明斯克各建筑物门前和新建筑物的鹰架上，都悬挂着列宁、斯大林的画像和彩色旗，它们衬托着市内重建的宽阔街道、漂亮的广场和优美的建筑群，显得分外美丽。在格鲁吉亚、摩尔达维亚和立陶宛，选民们都怀着兴奋的心情聚集到披着节日盛装的选举站，把自己爱戴的人选到地方政权机关中去。在立陶宛共和国首都维尔那，当晨雾笼罩着格迪门古塔的时候，选民们就都集聚在投票站前了。女工布·斯梅丽特在投票后向塔斯社记者说：我们共和国的人民以劳动的成就来庆祝选举日。我们投票选举我们最优秀的代表，就是为了共产主义和世界和平。
    据新华社讯：据塔斯社莫斯科讯：莫斯科选民二十二日热烈举行莫斯科州、市、区地方苏维埃选举。这一天全市呈现一片节日气象。街道上挂满了鲜艳的旗帜、标语和五色灯彩，人们都穿着节日盛装，兴高采烈地赶到选举站去投票。
    清晨，早在上午六点钟以前就有几百人集中到以约·维·斯大林为莫斯科苏维埃候选人的斯大林选区第一选举站门前。到了六点钟，扩音器传来了克里姆林宫的钟声，选举就开始了。选举委员会主席瓦·阿巴库莫夫热烈地向选民祝贺，并请他们开始投票。接着选民们源源不断地进行投票，许多人怀着骄傲的心情投票选举伟大的和平旗手——斯大林。到中午为止，全区的选民都投了票。在四十八个新建立的选区中，人们也热烈地进行了选举。在选举过程中，他们都深信，斯大林党与非党联盟的候选人——他们故乡最优秀的男女，不遗余力地使苏联首都变得更加美丽、更加完善的人们——不会辜负他们的深切信任。
    莫斯科人提出了苏联人民的领袖和导师约·维·斯大林做他们的第一名候选人。在其他候选人中有共产党和苏维埃政府的领袖，七十四位斯大林奖金获得者、三十二位苏联英雄和社会主义劳动英雄。
    傍晚，歌声和音乐在挂满红旗的街道上回响着。选举委员会将在午夜打开投票箱，计算票数，并宣布莫斯科人选到市、区苏维埃的七千名代表的名字。
