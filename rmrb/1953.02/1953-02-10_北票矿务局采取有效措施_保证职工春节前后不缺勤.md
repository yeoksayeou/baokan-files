The production task of Beipiao Mining Bureau this year is doubled compared with last year. February has only twenty-five working days left due to the three-day Spring Festival holiday, therefore the average daily output of the whole bureau has increased a lot compared with January. Under such circumstances, ensuring that employees are not absent before and after the Spring Festival has become the key to whether the February task can be completed. In order to achieve this, the Beipiao Mining Bureau has taken the following measures: 1. Vigorously carry out propaganda and education, using specific examples, combined with the improvement of production and the rise of living welfare, to illustrate the important significance of completing the state plan. On this basis, the employees have revised the group's patriotic pact, taking the guarantee of attendance rate as the main content; and formed mutual aid groups according to the distance of residence, agreeing to go to work on time together after the Spring Festival. More than 50 newly married workers in Guanshan Mine, who had originally arranged to visit their parents-in-law after the fifth day of the lunar new year, have now decided not to go, saying, "Completing the task is important." 2. Do a good job in family work. At the end of January, many people were not at work. The party, administrative, trade union, and youth league cadres at the pithead went to the villages to express their condolences to the sick workers, and at the same time learned that most of the people who were not at work were on leave for personal matters such as buying New Year goods, washing rice and rolling flour, and slaughtering pigs. Therefore, they invited village cadres to a meeting and organized mutual aid groups to do these housework. At the same time, the women's department of the trade union has also strengthened family work, which has played a great role in ensuring employee attendance. 3. Solve the food, accommodation and recreational activities for single workers during the holidays. The employee canteen decided not to rest during the holidays, and specially prepare good meals for workers who do not go home. The club decided to open as usual, and the cultural troupe will perform programs. After such arrangements, many workers who live far away are unwilling to go back. They said, "Going home does not give you a chance to rest, and you have to spend money. It is better to send the travel expenses back home and let the family have a better year." With these measures taken by the Beipiao Mining Bureau, the attendance rate of each pit has increased from 90% to 92% to over 95%.

    北票矿务局采取有效措施
    保证职工春节前后不缺勤
    【本报讯】北票矿务局今年的生产任务比去年增加一倍。二月份要放春节假三天，只剩下了二十五个工作日，因此全局平均日产量又较一月份增加了很多。在这种情况下，保证职工春节前后不缺勤，就成了能否完成二月份任务的关键。为了做到这一点，北票矿务局采取了下面几个办法：一、大力进行宣传教育，通过具体事例，结合生产提高、生活福利上升的情况，说明完成国家计划的重要意义。在此基础上，职工们纷纷把保证出勤率作为主要内容，修订了小组爱国公约；并按居住远近，自动编成互助小组，约定在春节后一起按时上班。冠山矿五十多名新结婚的工人，原来已经安排好要在旧历初五以后去给岳父母拜年，现在都决定不去了，都说：“完成任务要紧。”二、做好家属工作。一月末，不上工的人很多。坑口的党、行政、工会、青年团的干部便协同医务人员到村里去慰问生病的工人，同时了解到不上工的人大部分是办年货、淘米轧面、宰猪等事假。于是他们便邀请村干部开会，组织互助组，把这些家务事都做好了。同时，工会妇女部也加强了家属工作，对保证职工出勤起了很大作用。三、给独身工人解决假期的食住和娱乐活动。职工食堂决定假期不休息，专为不回家的工人做好菜饭。俱乐部决定照常开放，并由文工组演出节目。这样布置了以后，许多路远的职工都不愿意回去了，他们说：“回一趟家也捞不着休息，还要花钱。不如把路费寄回去，让家里过个更好的年。”北票矿务局采取了这些措施，原来各坑出勤率只有百分之九十到九十二，现在已经提高到百分之九十五以上。
