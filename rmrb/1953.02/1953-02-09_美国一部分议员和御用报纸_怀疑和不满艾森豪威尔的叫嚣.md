Xinhua News Agency, 7th dispatch: After Eisenhower issued a bluster attempting to use the Kuomintang remnants to harass the Chinese mainland, reactionary congressmen in the US Congress and kept newspapers of the US ruling group followed suit, cheering for Eisenhower. However, amidst this war clamor, there were many doubts and dissatisfactions, some calling it an empty gesture, and others even cursing Eisenhower as "stupid."

Powerful Democratic Senator Paul Douglas, in a radio broadcast talk, made it clear that he doubted the actual effectiveness of Eisenhower's decision. Douglas believed that the Kuomintang remnants had previously harassed the Chinese mainland "with the permission of the US Seventh Fleet," and he did not know what effect that had. He did not see how openly carrying it out now would help "end the Korean War." Another Senator, J. William Fulbright, simply called Eisenhower's action on Taiwan an "empty gesture" whose "value is highly questionable." Fulbright expressed complete pessimism about the strength of the Kuomintang remnants on whom Eisenhower pinned his hopes. He said: "I dare not say whether Chiang Kai-shek's military strength can hold its own in Taiwan. Moreover, I highly doubt the value of massively transporting military supplies to Chiang Kai-shek."

Not only that, but Eisenhower's bluster made many people in the US ruling group feel afraid of the prospect of a war expanding and not being worth the losses. As soon as Eisenhower announced the decision on Taiwan, the Associated Press reported that some members of the US Congress "were worried that this might involve the United States in a war on the Chinese mainland." They clearly realized that this would be a fatal path for the understaffed United States, which had already suffered a disastrous defeat in Korea. Many newspapers issued clear warnings about the serious consequences that Eisenhower's decision might cause. The Minneapolis Tribune said: "We may be more deeply involved in the Far East war, without receiving substantial assistance from any of our major allies." The New York Post called Eisenhower's adventurous action a "stupid action," which would only "create disunity among free countries (capitalist countries)," and "this huge price cannot produce military miracles." The newspaper believes that Eisenhower's "action is not worth the loss, either diplomatically or militarily."

An Associated Press dispatch from Washington on the 3rd expressed doubts about what magic weapon Eisenhower could have next after making such a big show. It reminded Eisenhower to remember: As early as the "MacArthur incident the year before, a conclusion had been affirmed: the 'quagmire' of the Chinese mainland will be the tomb of any invading army."

### 美国一部分议员和御用报纸  怀疑和不满艾森豪威尔的叫嚣

    美国一部分议员和御用报纸
    怀疑和不满艾森豪威尔的叫嚣
    【新华社七日讯】在艾森豪威尔发出了企图利用国民党残匪窜扰中国大陆的叫嚣之后，美国国会中的反动议员和美国统治集团的御用报纸跟着为艾森豪威尔呐喊助威。但是就在这一片战争喧嚷声中，却夹杂着不少的怀疑和不满，有的说是空洞姿态，有的甚至咒骂艾森豪威尔“愚蠢”。
    有势力的民主党参议员保罗·道格拉斯在无线电广播谈话中对于艾森豪威尔的决定究竟有多少实际效力一点，明白表示怀疑。道格拉斯认为，国民党残匪过去就“在美国第七舰队的容许下”对中国大陆进行骚扰，他不知道那有什么作用。现在公开地来进行，他看不出对于“结束朝鲜战争”有多大帮助。另一名参议员杰·威廉·福尔布莱特干脆把艾森豪威尔对台湾的行动说成为一个“空洞的姿态”，其“价值大可怀疑”。福尔布莱特对艾森豪威尔希望所寄的国民党残匪的力量表示完全的悲观。他说：“蒋介石的军事力量能不能在台湾保住自己，我都不敢说。而且，大规模运送军事物资给蒋介石有什么价值，我也非常怀疑。”
    不仅如此，艾森豪威尔的叫嚣使美国统治集团的许多人士对于战争假如扩大的得不偿失的前景感到恐惧。艾森豪威尔刚刚宣布了关于台湾的决定，合众社就报道，美国若干国会人士“担心这可能使美国卷入中国大陆战争”。他们显然认识到对于已在朝鲜遭受惨败的兵力不足的美国，这将是一条致命的道路。许多报纸对艾森豪威尔这一决定可能造成的严重后果发出了明白的警告。“明尼阿波利斯论坛报”说：“我们可能更深地陷入远东战争，而得不到我们任何一个主要盟国的大量援助。”“纽约邮报”把艾森豪威尔这种冒险行动称为“愚蠢的行动”，其结果只会“使自由国家（资本主义国家）间产生不团结现象”，而“这笔巨大的代价并不能产生军事奇迹”。该报认为：艾森豪威尔“这种行动无论在外交上或军事上来说都是得不偿失的。”
    美联社三日华盛顿电对于艾森豪威尔在这样大事张扬之后，下一步究竟能有什么法宝表示怀疑。它提醒艾森豪威尔记住：早在前年“麦克阿瑟事件中就已肯定了一个结论：中国大陆的‘泥淖’将是任何侵略军的坟墓。”
