    A Friendship the World Has Never Seen
    Nikolai Tikhonov, Chairman of the Soviet Peace Defense Committee,
    Writer, Stalin Prize Winner
    When Soviet people begin to talk about China, they cannot speak indifferently. They speak of it with excitement, great enthusiasm and warmth, as if speaking of something very close to them.

    Soviet people eagerly listen to stories about the new People's China, listen to Chinese music and songs, watch Chinese films and dramas, and read novels and poems by Chinese writers and poets.

    At dusk, Soviet university students stand shoulder to shoulder with their Chinese friends—students from Moscow's higher education institutions—on the broad embankment of the Moscow River, admiring the great city and the magnificent winter sunset. Against the backdrop of the sunset, the stars of the Kremlin and the spires of some tall buildings appear even more distinct in the sky of pale purple and light blue clouds with crimson hues.

    The new things happening in China cannot but excite the Soviet people. The Soviet people have always watched the heroic struggle of the Chinese people. Under the leadership of the Communist Party and the tested people's leader Mao Zedong, the Chinese people shattered the resistance of oppressors and executioners, and won freedom for China.

    The Soviet people have long loved the beautiful, hardworking, brotherly people of China, and sincerely hoped for their complete victory. Victory came, and it came beautifully on such a best day of spring, a spring that, although not found on the calendar, ignited a great joy of awakening life in the hearts of the people.

    Would a true friend not rejoice in such a change for their friend? The Soviet people came to help them heal the wounds left by long years of war, to help them build cities and villages from the ruins, and to rebuild factories and mines.

    Wherever there is a need to bravely and systematically promote new things, you will see how good and sincere the mutual relationship between friends—ordinary technicians from both countries—is, how much they love each other, how they are linked by a great belief in the future, and how they are filled with the great thought—the advanced thought of our time.

    The sincere desire to help each other guides them towards a path of greater perfection, a path of high development, and towards new victories.

    We see that now in China, under the leadership of the working class, even the most backward tribes are acquiring cultural and socialist ideas.

    We, the Soviet people, cannot but rejoice when we read about these things: the light of a new life shines on long-darkened Tibet, soldiers of the People's Liberation Army build roads across unclimbable mountains and snowfields, and teach the laws of free China to their herding brothers; a new city is built in the Gobi Desert; irrigation canals are dug in Shandong Province; new roads are built in Xinjiang Province; schools are being established everywhere, and songs of victory praise the victorious people.

    We remember the immortal feats of the Chinese People's Volunteers in the unconquerable Korea. These feats are very dear to the Soviet people, who well understand the value of such heroism and unparalleled strength.

    The Soviet people are ready to help our Chinese friends and brothers in all respects. In the most difficult times for the Chinese people, the Soviet people sympathized with and helped them, and in the happy times of victory, they share their joy, because the Soviet people believe that a friend's cause is their own cause, and there can be no other thought.

    When the great China stood tall, life demanded a document, demanding the consolidation of the long-term and selfless friendship between our two peoples. Thus, under the wise leadership of the great leaders of the great peoples, the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance was born. The idea and scale of this treaty are unprecedented in human history.

    There have been many treaties in history: just treaties and treaties imposed by force, temporary treaties, treaties between the strong and the weak, and treaties between the strong.

    But this treaty is a treaty between two great peoples who have defeated their enemies in fierce struggles, and this treaty expresses such a determination to serve the cause of peace and such a strong will against all war provocateurs, and therefore it cannot but influence the international situation in the most favorable way for peaceful countries.

    The great principles of the Soviet state's foreign policy are fully reflected in this treaty. Deep respect for the national dignity and national rights of the Chinese people is consolidated in this treaty.

    Warm and selfless support flows between the lines of this document, which is unprecedented from the perspective of international relations. Our two peoples, united by peaceful goals to promote the new development of our brotherly countries, stand tall like giants.

    Every year, on the anniversary of the signing of this treaty, we will inevitably recall these glorious and educational events, and at the same time, we will be witnesses to the ever-changing economic and cultural progress of our two peoples, we will be witnesses to new victories on the front of national construction, and we will be witnesses to new achievements in science and art, and new developments in our cultural exchanges.

    With the help of this treaty, which serves as a powerful weapon, the boundless vast land—from the perpetually snowy Tianshan Mountains, from the vast desert regions of the Gobi to the distant, sweltering south on the borders of the Pacific Ocean and Myanmar and Vietnam—is set in motion.

    From then on, the sound of life and creation will resonate across this vast land, and construction teams, surveyors, and technicians of all kinds of production will engage in the work of transforming it. New roads will connect new cities.

    When the people of the new China say: Today's Soviet Union is tomorrow's China, this is not just a pretty saying, it is a prediction. This sentence will be realized, just as today the achievements of Soviet technology serve the liberated Chinese people as reliably.

    In 1953, the first Five-Year Plan of China's national economy began to be implemented, and the Soviet people will also help them in this great and best cause.

    I will never forget those days last year when I was in China, when thousands and millions of voices shouted in welcoming the Soviet people: Long live the eternal and unbreakable friendship of the two great peoples of China and the Soviet Union!

    I would also like to cheer with them, and emphasize two eternally glorious names: "Long live Mao Zedong!" "Long live Stalin!" (Translated by Jun Qiang) (Attached picture)

### 世界上从未有过的友谊

    世界上从未有过的友谊
    苏联保卫和平委员会主席
    作家、斯大林奖金获得者  尼古拉·吉洪诺夫
    当苏联人开始谈到中国的时候，他们不能淡漠地谈。他们激动地、非常兴奋地和热情地谈到它，像是谈到一个什么非常亲近的事物。
    苏联人贪婪地听着关于新的人民中国的故事，听中国音乐、中国歌曲，看中国电影和话剧，读中国作家和诗人的小说和诗歌。
    黄昏时，苏联的大学生们和他们的中国朋友——莫斯科高等学校的学生们——并肩站在广阔的莫斯科河岸大街上，他们欣赏着伟大的城市和奇妙的冬季的落日。在落日的衬托下，克里姆林宫的星和一些高建筑物的尖顶，在淡紫和淡蓝色的带有深红色的云彩的天空中显得更加清晰了。
    中国所发生的一切新事物，是不能不激动苏联人的。苏联人一向是注视着中国人民的英勇斗争的。中国人民在共产党领导下，在经过考验的人民领袖毛泽东的领导之下，粉碎了压迫者和刽子手的抵抗，使中国获得了自由。
    苏联人很久以前就喜爱美好的、爱好劳动的兄弟中国的人民，衷心希望他们获得彻底的胜利。胜利来到了，它非常美丽地在这样一个春天的最好的日子里来到了，这个春天虽然是日历上不曾有的，但是在人民的心灵中它燃烧起唤醒生活的巨大快乐。
    真正的朋友难道会不为朋友的这种改变而欢乐吗？苏联人来帮助他们医治长期战争所带来的创伤，帮助他们从废墟上建起城市和村庄，重新建好工厂和矿山。
    在需要勇敢地和有组织地推进新事物的各个地方，你都会看见朋友们——两国人民的普通技师们的相互关系是多么好，多么真诚相爱，他们是由对前途的伟大信念所联系在一起的，他们充满了伟大的思想——我们时代的先进思想。
    互相帮助的真诚愿望，引导他们走向更加完善的道路，高度发展的道路，走向新的胜利。
    我们看到，现在在工人阶级领导下的中国，过去最落后的部族都正在获得文化和社会主义的思想。
    我们，苏联人，当读到以下这些事情时是不能不欢喜的：新生活的光芒照到了长期昏暗的西藏，人民解放军的战士把公路修过不能攀登的高山和雪地，并把自由中国的法律教给牧民兄弟，戈壁沙漠上建立起一座新的城市，山东省开凿灌溉渠，新疆省新建公路，各处都在建立学校，胜利的歌曲歌颂着胜利的人。
    我们记得中国人民志愿军在不可征服的朝鲜的不朽功绩。这些功绩对苏联人民是非常亲切的，苏联人民非常了解这种英雄主义和无比的坚强的价值。
    苏联人准备在各方面来帮助我们的中国朋友和兄弟。在中国人民最困难的时代，苏联人曾同情和帮助他们，而在胜利的幸福时代则和他们同享快乐，因为苏联人认为朋友的事业就是自己的切身事业，不可能有其他想法。
    当伟大的中国挺起胸来的时候，生活要求有一个文件，要求巩固我们两国人民互相间长期的和忘我的友谊。这样，由伟大人民的伟大领袖的英明而产生了中苏友好同盟互助条约。这个条约的思想和规模是人类历史上空前所未有的。
    历史上有过许多条约：正义的条约和强迫接受的条约，暂时的条约，强者和弱者之间、强者和强者之间的条约。
    但是这个条约是两个曾在残酷的斗争中战胜了敌人的伟大人民的条约，这个条约表示出为和平事业而服务的这样的决心和反对一切战争挑拨者的这样的坚强意志，因而它就不能不在对和平国家最有利的情况下影响到国际局势。
    苏维埃国家对外政策的伟大原则，充分反映在这个条约中。对于中国人民的民族尊严和民族权利的深刻尊敬，在这个条约中巩固下来。
    热烈的和无私的支持，流露在这个从国际关系的观点看来是空前的文件的字里行间。为促使兄弟国家走向新的发展的和平目标所团结在一起的我们两国人民，巨人般地站立起来。
    每一年，在这个条约缔结的这一天，我们将不由自主地会回忆起这些光荣的和有教育意义的事情，同时我们将是我两国人民日新月异的经济和文化进步的见证人，我们将是国家建设战线上新的胜利的见证人，将是科学和艺术中的新成就、我们文化交流的新发展的见证人。
    借助于做为有力武器的这个条约，无垠的辽阔土地——由终年积雪的天山，由戈壁的广阔沙漠地带到太平洋和缅甸与越南的边境的遥远的暑热南方——都动起来了。
    从此，这个广阔的土地上将响起生活和创造的声音，建筑工作队、勘察者和各种生产的技师都将从事改造它的工作。新的道路将把一些新的城市连接起来。
    当新中国的人们说：今天的苏联就是明天的中国时，这并不只是一句漂亮话，这是预见。这句话将会实现，就像今天苏联技术的成就服务于解放了的中国人一样可靠。
    一九五三年，中国国民经济的第一个五年计划开始实行，苏联人民在这个伟大的和最好的事业中也会帮助他们。
    我永不会忘记去年我在中国的那些日子，在欢迎苏联人时成千成万的声音都在喊：中苏两国伟大人民的永久的牢不可破的友谊万岁！
    我也愿意和他们共同欢呼，并着重指出两个永久光荣的名字：“毛泽东万岁！”“斯大林万岁！”（君强译）（附图片）
