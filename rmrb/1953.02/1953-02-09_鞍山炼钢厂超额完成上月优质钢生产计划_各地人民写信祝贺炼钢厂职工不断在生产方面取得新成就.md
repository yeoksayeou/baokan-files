Xinhua News Agency: The workers of the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's steel plant, responding to Chairman Mao's call for "producing large quantities of high-quality steel," overfulfilled their high-quality steel production plan for January by 0.5 percent. This planned output increased by 173.5 percent compared to the same period last year, and the scrap rate decreased by 5.8 percent. In addition, the steel plant workers also successfully completed the task of trial-producing steel frame structure steel in January this year. The quality requirements of this steel are as strict as those of high-quality steel. The plant is now producing this new product in large quantities, which is urgently needed for China's basic construction.

To realize Chairman Mao's call for producing large quantities of high-quality steel and to complete the new task of trial-producing steel for factory structures, they held continuous meetings to examine the shortcomings in production and formulated plans and specific measures. To ensure the fulfillment and overfulfillment of the production plan, the plant director sometimes rushed to the site late at night to personally solve the problems that occurred in smelting high-quality steel and steel for factory structures. Zhuang Zongxun, a quality control engineer, often insisted on working 18 or 19 hours a day to take concrete charge of the trial production of new products. To ensure the quality of high-quality steel, the laboratory personnel adopted rapid analysis methods and tested the steel water every ten minutes. After receiving Chairman Mao's letter, the ingot casting workers held a swearing-in rally, determined to ensure that the quality of high-quality steel met the specifications. They selected the best molds for casting high-quality steel ingots, applied the refractory mud for the insulating caps on the molds firmly and smoothly, and paid special attention to baking them dry to avoid impurities being mixed in during casting. During casting, the workers carefully controlled the steel casting speed according to the temperature of the steel liquid, avoiding phenomena such as cracks in the steel ingots. In order to ensure timely steel tapping, the workers in the workshop worked hard to improve the turnover rate of the molds. Before December, each mold was turned over once every twelve hours, but now it has been shortened to nine hours, which has greatly contributed to the overfulfillment of the high-quality steel production plan.

Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, February 7th: People across the country have been writing letters to congratulate the workers of the state-owned Anshan Iron and Steel Company's steel plant on their great achievements on the production front. Since the steel plant created a new steelmaking record exceeding the level of capitalist countries at the end of November last year, it has received congratulatory letters from the capital, from the Korean front, and from all parts of the motherland every day. At the most, it received more than 40 letters a day. The letter writers included commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteers, commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, as well as workers, technicians, farmers, students, and literary and art workers from all over the country.

In their letters, people from all over the country enthusiastically told the steel plant workers that they had seen the prospects of the motherland's construction and the unlimited creativity of the working class, which greatly encouraged their fighting will and work enthusiasm, and strengthened their confidence in building a great motherland. The heroes who were guarding the Maryang-san position on the Korean front wrote in their letter: "Your victory and achievements make us, who are far away from the motherland and fighting on the Korean front, feel extremely happy and proud. We yearn for the beautiful future of the motherland, and we feel even more the greatness of the working class of the motherland!" After describing how they had inflicted heavy blows on the American aggressors in the past year, the letter continued: "Comrades, the American aggressors have not given up. We guarantee to defeat the enemy, and you guarantee to build Anshan Iron and Steel. For our motherland, let us work together to strive for greater victories!" All the second-year students of the metallurgy department of Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology said in their letter: "The news that you have created a new steelmaking record exceeding the level of steelmaking in capitalist countries has strengthened our confidence and determination to study our profession. In order to industrialize our country as soon as possible, we resolutely pledge to you—our future colleagues and teachers: in the future, we will be more strict with ourselves, study diligently, and grasp scientific knowledge more firmly to fulfill the tasks assigned to us by the motherland at the present stage."

These letters enthusiastically hoped and congratulated the steel plant workers on making greater achievements in 1953 to support the motherland's large-scale economic construction.

    鞍山炼钢厂超额完成上月优质钢生产计划
    各地人民写信祝贺炼钢厂职工不断在生产方面取得新成就
    据新华社讯：国营鞍山钢铁公司炼钢厂职工，响应毛主席向他们提出的“大量生产优质钢”的号召，一月份超额百分之零点五完成了生产优质钢的计划。这个计划产量比去年同期产量提高了百分之一百七十三点五，同时废品率也比过去降低了百分之五点八。此外，炼钢厂的职工在今年一月份还胜利地完成了试制钢架结构钢的任务。这种钢的质量要求，同优质钢一样严格。该厂正大量地生产这种为我国基本建设迫切需要的新产品。
    他们为了实现毛主席关于大量生产优质钢的号召和完成试制厂房结构钢的新任务，曾连续开会检查了生产中的缺点，并订出了计划和具体措施。为了保证完成和超额完成生产计划，该厂厂长有时在深夜还赶到现场亲自解决熔炼优质钢和厂房结构钢中发生的问题。质量专责工程师庄宗勋常常每天坚持十八、九个小时的工作，具体掌握新产品的试制工作。为了保证优质钢的质量，化验人员采用快速分析法，每隔十分钟就把钢水化验一次。铸锭工人在毛主席来信后，就举行了宣誓大会，决心保证优质钢的质量合乎规格。他们挑选最好的模子铸优质钢的钢锭，模子上保温帽的耐火泥，抹得又结实又光滑，并特别注意把它烤干，避免铸锭时混入杂质。铸锭时，工人们认真地根据钢液的温度，想各种方法控制铸钢速度，避免了钢锭裂缝等现象。该车间工人为了保证及时出钢，努力提高了模子的周转速度。十二月份以前每个模子十二小时周转一次，现已缩短到九小时，这对优质钢产量超额完成计划起了很大作用。
    【新华社鞍山七日电】全国人民纷纷写信祝贺国营鞍山钢铁公司炼钢厂职工在生产战线上取得的伟大成就。自从炼钢厂在去年十一月末创造超过资本主义国家水平的炼钢新纪录以后，每天都接到从首都、从朝鲜前线和祖国各地寄来的贺信。最多的时候，每天要收到四十多封。写信的人包括中国人民志愿军指战员和中国人民解放军指战员以及全国各地的工人、技术人员、农民、学生、文艺工作者等。
    各地人民在来信中都热情地告诉炼钢厂的职工说：他们看到了祖国建设的远景和工人阶级无限的创造力，因而大大鼓舞了他们的战斗意志和工作热情，增强了建设伟大祖国的信心。坚守在朝鲜前线马良山阵地的英雄们在信中写道：“你们的胜利和成就，使远离祖国、战斗在朝鲜前线的我们感到无比的高兴和骄傲，我们向往着祖国美好的将来，我们更感到祖国的工人阶级的伟大！”信中在叙述了他们在过去一年给美国侵略军以严重打击的情形后，继续写道：“同志们，美国侵略者还没有死心，我们保证包打敌人，你们包建鞍钢，为了我们的祖国，我们共同努力争取更大的胜利！”北京钢铁学院冶炼系二年级全体学生在信中说：“你们创造超过资本主义各国炼钢水平的新纪录的消息，使我们加强了学习业务的信心和决心。为了使我国早日工业化，我们坚决地向你们——未来工作上的同志和老师提出保证：今后要更加严格要求自己，踏实地学习，更牢固地掌握科学知识，实现祖国在现阶段交付给我们的任务。”
    这些来信都热情地希望并祝贺炼钢厂职工在一九五三年创造更大的成绩，以支援祖国大规模的经济建设。
