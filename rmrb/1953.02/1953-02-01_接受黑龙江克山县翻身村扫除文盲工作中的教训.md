Brief Commentary on Cultural Life:

Accept the Lessons Learned from the Illiteracy Eradication Work in Fanshen Village, Keshan County, Heilongjiang
    The illiteracy eradication work in Fanshen Village, Keshan County, Heilongjiang Province, failed due to the village cadres' blind pursuit of "model" and "banner" titles, and the erroneous leadership of the Provincial Department of Culture and Education's working group, as well as the county and district leading organs. This lesson should arouse the vigilance of cultural and educational leaders in various regions.
    The lesson of Fanshen Village tells us that the work of eliminating illiteracy must not be carried out in isolation. In carrying out this work, all aspects must be considered, first of all the economic living conditions of the masses, to see if they have the possibility of participating in learning. Chairman Mao said: "With the advent of the high tide of economic construction, a high tide of cultural construction will inevitably appear." It can be seen that cultural construction develops with the development of economic construction; it must adapt to the needs of economic construction and serve economic construction. If the objective conditions are not considered, and the work of eliminating illiteracy is blindly "rolled out across the board," one is bound to run into snags.
    The lesson of Fanshen Village also tells us that in the specific leadership of the work of eliminating illiteracy, attention must be paid to combining learning with production. If we simply emphasize cultural learning and neglect leadership in production, then the work of eliminating illiteracy will not be successful. The organizations leading production and the institutions leading illiteracy eradication work should be unified, work together in the same office, and implement unified leadership, unified division of labor, and unified planning. Only in this way can production teams become strong organizations for leading learning and production. Experience in many areas has proven that this approach is effective.
    The lesson of Fanshen Village also tells us that cadres in illiteracy eradication work must have an overall view and a mass perspective, and must always be vigilant against commandism in their work. Some cultural and educational cadres of the Heilongjiang Provincial People's Government and the Keshan County People's Government made mistakes in their work because they lacked this kind of thinking. After discovering this deviation in the village's illiteracy eradication work, although they knew that this deviation had had an adverse impact on the lives of the masses, they neither helped the village cadres correct this deviation nor reported the situation to the Party organization. Ignoring the urgent demands of the masses, they accommodated the erroneous opinions of the district cadres and blindly "rolled out" the illiteracy eradication work "across the board," which caused even greater losses to the people of the whole village.
    The issues raised based on the lessons of Fanshen Village deserve the attention of all regions. We hope that all regions will accept the lessons of Fanshen Village, earnestly examine the work of eliminating illiteracy, promote strengths, overcome shortcomings, and do this work even better.

    接受黑龙江克山县翻身村扫除文盲工作中的教训
    黑龙江省克山县翻身村的扫除文盲工作，由于村干部的盲目追求“模范”、“旗帜”称号，省文教厅工作组以及县、区领导机关的错误领导而失败了。这个教训应当引起各地文教领导干部的警惕。
    翻身村的教训告诉我们：扫除文盲工作决不能孤立地进行。在进行这一工作时，必须考虑到各方面的条件，首先是群众的经济生活条件，看他们有没有参加学习的可能。毛主席说过：“随着经济建设高潮的到来，不可避免地将要出现一个文化建设的高潮。”可见文化建设是随着经济建设的发展而发展的，它必须适应经济建设的需要，为经济建设服务。如果不问客观条件如何，盲目地把扫除文盲工作“全面铺开”，是一定会碰钉子的。
    翻身村的教训又告诉我们：在扫除文盲工作的具体领导上，必须注意把学习和生产结合起来。如果我们单纯地强调文化学习，忽视对生产的领导，那么，扫除文盲的工作是搞不好的。应该把领导生产的组织和领导扫除文盲工作的机构统一起来，合并办公，实行统一领导，统一分工，统一计划。这样才能使生产组成为领导学习和生产的强有力的组织。许多地区的经验证明，这种做法是有效的。
    翻身村的教训又告诉我们：扫除文盲工作的干部必须具有整体观念和群众观点，要时刻警惕自己工作中的命令主义作风。黑龙江省人民政府和克山县人民政府的某些文教干部因为缺乏这种思想，就在工作中犯了错误。他们在发现该村扫除文盲工作中的这一偏向以后，虽然知道这一偏向已给群众生活以不利影响；但是，他们既没有帮助村干部纠正这个偏向，也没有向党的组织反映这种情况。他们竟无视群众的迫切要求，迁就了区干部的错误意见，把扫除文盲工作盲目地“全面铺开”了，这就给全村人民造成了更大的损失。
    根据翻身村的教训提出来的问题，值得各地注意。我们希望各地接受翻身村的教训，切实检查一下扫除文盲工作，发扬优点，克服缺点，把这一工作做得更好。
