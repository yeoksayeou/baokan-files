Xinhua News Agency dispatch from New York: The February 2nd issue of the U.S. "Newsweek" openly admitted that the U.S. government is stepping up its espionage and sabotage activities against our country. The magazine's "Periscope" column stated: "Although this may be denied, the Eisenhower administration does intend to rely heavily on subversion and sabotage activities while intensifying the Cold War against the Soviet Union. Although few people know it, the fact is that the United States has already been carrying out such activities on a large scale against the Communists on the Chinese mainland. One of the reasons why this situation has been kept secret in the past is that Washington officials feared that the American public might be shocked if the fact that the United States has already adopted this 'dirty' practice were revealed."

    美国“新闻周刊”承认
    美国加紧对我国进行特务活动
    【新华社讯】纽约消息：二月二日的美国“新闻周刊”明白承认美国政府正在加紧对我国进行间谍特务破坏活动，该刊的“潜望镜”栏说：“尽管这件事可能遭到否认，但是艾森豪威尔政府的确打算在加紧对苏冷战的时候，大大地倚重颠覆活动和破坏活动。虽然很少人知道，事实是美国早已大事对中国大陆上的共产党进行着这种活动。过去这种情况之所以秘而不宣，原因之一就是，华盛顿官方害怕，如果把美国已经采取这种‘肮脏’做法的事实予以透露，那末美国公众可能将因此感到震惊。”
