    Spring Festival Visit to Military Families
    Jin Feng

    The Spring Festival of the motherland has arrived. The capital presents a scene of joy and celebration. A few days ago, people were crowding the cooperatives, vegetable markets, department stores, pastry shops, and candy stores..., busily purchasing all kinds of festive goods. New Year pictures have been hung up, new Spring Festival couplets have been pasted up, and festive red lanterns radiate a warm glow. At this happy and joyful moment, people are particularly likely to think of the defenders of their happiness – the Volunteer Army and the People's Liberation Army. In cities and villages, Young Pioneers wearing red scarves, militiamen carrying guns, and elderly grandpas and grandmas are all vying to help military families grind flour, sweep courtyards, and carry water.... Waves of gongs and drums, and teams of Yangko dancers, are offering comfort and congratulations to the glorious military families, and also sending them "Glory Lights," "Glory Plaques," and some festive goods. At this time, I visited several military families.

    I walked into the home of Grandpa Song, a well-known military family in Haidian Town. This family has three sons and two daughters who have joined the army: two are in the Volunteer Army, three are in the People's Liberation Army, covering the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Railway Engineering Corps, and the eldest son is the Party Secretary of a military factory. There are also three daughters in high school, the youngest son in junior high school, and the youngest daughter in elementary school. The old couple also have a pair of grandchildren by their side – six-year-old Xiaohong and three-year-old Xiaoguai. A month ago, the second daughter-in-law gave birth to a little girl, and the eldest daughter-in-law is still in the hospital "producing." This family, plus the eldest son-in-law (studying at the Military Academy) and grandchildren, numbers more than twenty people.

    Grandpa Song is an old postal worker who has worked for more than thirty years. He is from the Northeast and fled to the interior after the September 18th Incident. In the War of Resistance Against Japan, the War of Liberation, and the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, he successively sent his children to fight for the liberation of his class and for the independence and freedom of the motherland! He himself also participated in underground struggles and joined the Party after liberation. This family has a total of six Communist Party members and three Youth League members. In the words of the old lady, only she and the ten-year-old little girl have not joined an organization.

    This family's current life is very happy.

    Walking into the gate, you see a clean courtyard, and three bright north-facing rooms and two wing rooms. Inside the rooms, there is a large grandfather clock, large flowerpots, and a large iron bed piled high with floral silk and floral cotton cloth quilts. Next to it is a newly purchased sewing machine. The old lady is very capable and makes all the family's clothes. This year for the New Year, she sewed leather coats for herself, Xiaohong, Xiaoguai, and Grandpa. The old lady was very warm when she saw me. She was busy showing me the souvenirs brought back by the fourth son, who is in the Volunteer Air Force, and the second daughter, who is in the Railway Engineering Corps' cultural troupe – silk scarves, teacups, and diaries. She took out candy for everyone to eat, told me about her children's situations in Korea and in the military, and also chatted about a series of family matters, as if she couldn't stop talking.

    After dinner, the old couple went out to meetings: the old man went to participate in Party activities; the old lady is a street activist, busy attending two meetings – a public security and defense meeting and a military family representatives' meeting. The children were left at home. I told Xiaohong stories, played cards around the small round table, and Yazhen was reading "How the Steel Was Tempered." Xiaoguai was sleepy, and the little aunt put him on the kang, singing a lullaby in Grandpa's voice. What a warm and happy family! These children have their older brothers, sisters, uncles, and aunts on the front lines in Korea, guarding them in the skies, on the land, and in the seas of the motherland. They will be forever happy.

    The District People's Government introduced me to another famous military family member and labor model, Yang Shuqin. She is a production expert, a member of the District People's Government, and a mutual aid team leader.

    I went with Yang Shuqin to her home – Zhu Village – and we chatted very warmly along the way.

    Her husband joined the army, and there were no hands at home. The old man was sixty or seventy years old and worked as a mud bricklayer. Only she and her teenage little aunt and little uncle farmed the land together. Her family originally had thirteen mu of land, and they were allocated sixteen mu during the land reform, totaling twenty-nine mu of land. The three of them worked hard from dawn till dusk, and none of them needed substitute labor. The crops grew very well. In 1951, the district selected her as a model and awarded her two lengths of blue cloth, ten chi of white cloth, as well as a thermometer and fertilizer. Last year, after she attended the Beijing Municipal Labor Model Conference, she organized a mutual aid team of four households. In the autumn, each mu of land yielded more than 300 jin of grain. Counting the wheat harvest, each mu yielded more than 500 jin, more than half as much as before. She persuaded the team members to buy new agricultural tools and implement scientific seed selection and soaking.

    Her family has three large north-facing rooms with bright, large glass windows. A large red five-pointed star lantern hangs in front of the door, sent by the village when they came to comfort the military families. Pasted on the door is also a pair of congratulatory Spring Festival couplets: "Family members of heroes, serve as models in supporting the front," "Glorious family, take the lead on the production front." The little aunt, little uncle, and Yang Shuqin's eldest son, Fuliang, are all in school in the village and are now on vacation at home. The old man was in the room, smiling and inviting me to sit on the kang. On the kang, the third aunt, Guiqing, was reviewing the lessons of the literacy class with five or six girls from the village. They were all wearing new floral cotton-padded jackets and had small braids.

    Her family will have a good Spring Festival this year. Yang Shuqin told me that her family slaughtered a pig for the New Year, weighing 220 jin with hair, and 193 jin net weight. Sixty jin were distributed, and the rest was for their own consumption. "There are many people, and they eat a lot," she said with a smile. The New Year's noodles and yellow rice cakes have all been prepared, and mixed nuts and peanuts have also been bought. The old man led me to the back of the house, where I saw two small pigs being fed in the pigsty, weighing about thirty jin each. There was a large pile of manure fertilizer in the field.

    Grandma drove the cart back. She smiled and pointed to me: "This rubber-tired cart was awarded to Shuqin by the government last autumn, worth five or six million!" I was examining this cart when I heard a chorus of voices from the house: "Xiao Qingzi is back." It turned out that Yang Shuqin's four-year-old son, Xiao Qing, is the family's darling, and they all dote on him very much. Xiao Qing was also wearing a new cotton-padded jacket, and it was his second set. I saw that Xiao Qing was really handsome and couldn't help but praise him. His aunt said from the side: "How could he not grow up well? From childhood to adulthood, he hasn't eaten a single bite of coarse food. Grandpa dotes on him, Grandma dotes on him, and he's fed with rice and white flour. He eats at least two or three baked buns a day."

    This family is harmonious and productive, and they live a truly happy life.

    That night, Shuqin quietly told me: A month ago, she went to the Party training class to study, and it was great. Before, she was muddleheaded, only knowing how to work and eat, only knowing how to complain about being poor and suffering. Now, after listening to the Party lessons, she knows why she suffered before and what she should do in the future. Xiao Qing's father has already joined the Party. She feels that the requirements for a Communist Party member are very high, and she is still far from meeting them, so she must strive hard. After she joined the literacy class, the first book she bought was "How to Be a Good Communist."

    I returned to Grandpa Song's house, just in time to see the town government congratulating and celebrating his second daughter, Song Yaxuan. A pair of large red gauze lanterns were hung high in front of the door, and the meritorious service announcement and the "Heroic Sons and Daughters" glory plaque were also posted in the main room. A pair of large red couplets were pasted on the door: "Heroic sons and daughters, the whole family is honored," "People's model, revolutionary family." The waist drum team and the comfort team also brought Spring Festival comfort gifts of meat, vermicelli, rice, and flour. The streets and alleys were crowded with people. The old lady walked in and out happily, busily serving tea and water.

    On Lunar New Year's Eve, the public security forces stationed in the area also came to congratulate them. The room was filled with people. We all raised a glass high, wishing Chairman Mao good health, wishing good health to the old grandpa and grandma who raised this group of heroic children, and wishing the heroes even greater victories on the front lines.

    Joyful firecrackers and gongs and drums sounded, far and near, the sounds of firecrackers and gongs and drums blended into one. In the courtyard, we also set off firecrackers. "Bi bo bi bo," small sparks窜串(chuàn chuàn) upwards in strings. "Whoosh! Whoosh!" Orchid-shaped fireworks shot into the air, radiating beautiful colors. The children clapped their hands and laughed. Xiaohong thought of her second aunt on the front lines and asked me, "Auntie, when will my second aunt come back?" I told her that they would come back when they defeated the American devils, and I also told her that on that day, we would welcome the heroic uncles and aunts back in victory together, and we would listen to the victory salutes and watch the victory fireworks rise in the sky over Tiananmen Square!

    春节访军属
    金凤
    祖国的春节来到了。首都呈现一片欢乐景象。几天前，人们就挤满了合作社、小菜场、百货公司、糕饼铺、糖果店……，忙着购办各式各样的节货。年画挂起来了，新的春联贴起来了，喜气洋洋的红灯笼放射着温暖的光芒。在这幸福欢乐的时刻，人们特别容易想起自己幸福的保卫者——志愿军和解放军。在城市，在农村，带着红领巾的少年儿童队员，背着枪的民兵，上了年纪的老大爷老大娘们，都抢着给军属推磨、扫院子、挑水……。一阵阵的锣鼓声，一队队的秧歌队，在给光荣军属慰问贺喜，还送来了光荣灯、光荣匾和一些节货。在这个时候，我去访问了几家军属。
    我走进海淀镇有名的军属宋大爷家里。这一家有三个儿子、两个姑娘参军去了：两个是志愿军，三个是解放军，陆空海军、铁道兵团全有，还有一个大儿子是某军事工厂的党委书记。家里还有三姑娘在念高中，最小的儿子念初中，最小的姑娘念小学。老夫妇身边还有一对孙儿女——六岁的小红和三岁的小乖。一个月前，二儿媳又添了个小闺女，大儿媳还在医院里“生产”。这一家，加上大女婿（在军事学院学习）和外孙儿女，足足有二十几口人。
    宋大爷是工作了三十多年的老邮政工人，东北人，九一八后流亡关内。在抗日战争、解放战争和抗美援朝斗争中，他先后送出了自己的一对对儿女，为自己阶级的解放，为祖国的独立自由而战斗！他自己也参加了地下斗争，在解放后入了党。他这一家共有六个共产党员、三个青年团员，用老太太的话说，只有她和十岁的小丫头没有加入组织。
    这一个家庭现在的生活是十分幸福的。
    走进大门，就看到干净的院落，挺亮敞的三间北房和两间厢房。屋里面，摆设着大自鸣钟，大花盆，大铁床上堆满了花绸和花洋布的棉被。旁边是一架新买的缝纫机。老太太挺能干，一家的衣裳全由她做。今年过年，她给自己、小红、小乖和大爷都缝了皮大衣。老太太见我来了，挺亲热的。她忙着把参加志愿空军的老四和铁道兵团文工团的二姑娘捎回来的慰问品——丝巾、茶缸和日记本给我看，把糖拿出来大家吃，向我讲了儿女在朝鲜和部队的情况，也拉了一连串的家常，好像说不完似的。
    晚饭后，老夫妇都出去开会：老大爷去参加党的活动；老太太是街道积极分子，忙着参加两个会——治安保卫会议和军属代表会。家里就剩下孩子们。我给小红讲故事，围着小圆桌玩扑克，亚珍在看“普通一兵”。小乖困了，小姑把他抱到炕上，学着爷爷的声调唱催眠歌。多么温暖、幸福的家庭啊！这些孩子们，有他们的哥哥、姐姐、叔叔、姑姑们在朝鲜前线，在祖国的天空、陆地和海洋上保卫着他们，他们是永远幸福的。
    区人民政府给我介绍了另一位有名的军属劳动模范杨淑琴。她是生产能手、区人民政府委员、互助组长。
    我和杨淑琴一同上她家——朱房村去，一路上聊得很亲热。
    她丈夫参军去了，家里没有人手，老爹六七十岁，做泥瓦小工，家里就她和十几岁的小姑、小叔一起耕种土地。她家原有十三亩地，土地改革时分了十六亩，共有二十九亩地。三个人起早贪黑地干，全都不用代耕，庄稼长得很好。一九五一年区里选她当了模范，奖了两丈蓝布，十尺白布，还有温度表和肥田粉。去年她参加北京市劳动模范大会回来，组织了四户的互助组。秋后每亩地打了三百多斤粮食，连麦秋算上，每亩收到五百多斤，比以前多打一半。她说服组员，买了新式农具，实行科学的选种浸种。
    她家有三间大北房，大玻璃窗亮堂堂的。门前挂着大红五角灯，是村里来慰问军属时送来的。门上贴的也是一对慰问的春联“功臣家属支前工作当模范”，“光荣门第生产战线作先锋”。小姑、小叔和杨淑琴的大儿子福良都在村里上学，现在也都放假在家。老爹在屋里，笑着招呼我上炕坐。炕上，三姑桂卿正和村里五六个姑娘复习速成识字班的功课。她们一色都是穿着新花布棉袄，梳着小辫子。
    她一家今年春节可要过得好啦。杨淑琴告诉我，她家过年杀了一口猪，连毛重二百二十斤，净重一百九十三斤，分出去六十斤，余下来自家吃。“人多，吃得多哪”，她笑着说。过年的面和黄米年糕都弄好了，杂拌、花生也都买下了。老爹领我到屋后，只见猪圈里又喂着两口小猪，有三十来斤重。地里堆着一大堆粪肥。
    奶奶赶着大车回来了。她笑着指给我看：“这辆胶轮大车是去年大秋政府奖给淑琴的，值五六百万哩。”我正在打量这辆车，只听得屋里一片声叫：“小青子回来啦。”原来杨淑琴四岁的儿子小青，是全家的宝贝，都把他疼得什么似的。小青身上也穿着新棉衣，而且是第二套的了。我看小青长得真俊，禁不住称赞起来，他姑姑在一旁说：“怎么长得不好，从小到大，没有吃一口粗的，爷爷疼他，奶奶疼他，尽是大米，白面喂大的，一天少说也吃两三个烧饼饽饽。”
    这一家和和气气，劳动生产，日子过得真和美。
    当天晚上，淑琴悄悄地告诉我：一个月以前她上了党训班学习，可好哪。以前自己糊里糊涂，只知道干活吃饭，只知道怨命穷受苦。现在听了党课，才知道以前为什么受苦，以后该怎么做。小青他爸爸已经入党啦，自己觉得共产党员条件很高，自己还很不够，要努力争取。她参加速成识字后，买的第一本书就是“怎样做一个共产党员”。
    我又回到宋大爷的家里，正赶上镇政府给她二姑娘宋亚宣庆功贺喜。一对大红纱灯高高挂在门前，立功喜报和“英雄儿女”的光荣匾也贴在堂屋。大门上贴了一副大红对联是：“英雄儿女全家荣耀”，“人民楷模革命家庭”。腰鼓队和慰问队还送来了春节慰问的肉、粉条、米和面。人挤了一街一巷。老太太顶高兴的走出走进忙着招呼茶水。
    旧历除夕，驻在当地的公安部队也来贺喜。人挤满一屋子。我们都高高举起一杯酒，祝毛主席健康，祝养育了这一群英雄儿女的老大爷、老大妈健康，祝英雄们在前线打更大的胜仗。
    欢乐的鞭炮和锣鼓声响起来了，远远近近，鞭炮声和锣鼓声响成一片。到院子中，我们也放起了爆竹，“必剥必剥”小火星成串地往上窜。“嗖！嗖”，一支支兰花窜入空中，放射出美丽的色彩。孩子们拍手欢笑。小红想起了前线的二姑姑，问我：“姑姑，二姑姑什么时候回来？”我告诉他，打败了美国鬼子就要回来，还告诉他，到那一天，我们会一起迎接英雄的叔叔、姑姑们胜利回来，会一起来听胜利的礼炮轰鸣，来看胜利的礼花在天安门上空升起！
