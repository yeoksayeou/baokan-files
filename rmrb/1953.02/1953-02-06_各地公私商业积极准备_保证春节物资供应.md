Xinhua News Agency, February 5th: Following the Central People's Government Ministry of Commerce's January 24th instruction to national state-owned commercial departments to fully prepare forces and ensure the supply for the Spring Festival, various regions have earnestly organized and led this work. Many regions have convened special meetings to discuss the Spring Festival supply, as well as meetings of private business sectors and symposiums of the Federation of Industry and Commerce, to specifically study and deploy the supply work for the Spring Festival. For example, in Shanghai, under the close coordination of state-owned commerce and cooperatives, in addition to determining to supply 42,000 pigs, 2.11 million catties of hens and cured meat, and more than 26,700 catties of winter bamboo shoots and other items, as well as 4.5 million catties of sweets and melon seeds during the Spring Festival, it has also been decided to establish supply stations at key intersections during the festival and designate ten state-owned retail stores to operate non-staple food businesses during the Spring Festival to strengthen the supply work. Another example is Beijing, which has already stockpiled a large quantity of live pigs, cattle, sheep, fruits, and cooking oil, and is continuing to vigorously organize purchases and transfers. Cities such as Chongqing, Tianjin, Wuhan, and Shenyang have also fully prepared the necessary materials for the festival. Under the organization of state-owned commercial departments, many private merchants have also actively participated in the supply work for the Spring Festival. At present, in addition to vigorously organizing the transfer of festive materials, state-owned commercial departments in various regions are further inspecting the preparations for the Spring Festival supply work to ensure the sufficient supply of Spring Festival materials.

    【新华社五日讯】在中央人民政府商业部一月二十四日指示全国国营商业部门：充分准备力量，保证春节供应的指示下达后，各地都认真组织、领导了这一工作。许多地区召集了专门讨论春节供应的会议，私营商业各行业会议、工商业联合会座谈会等会议，具体研究、部署了春节的供应工作。如上海市在国营商业与合作社的密切配合下，除已确定在春节期间供应猪四万二千头、母鸡与咸肉二百一十一万斤、冬笋等二万六千七百多斤、糖果瓜子等四百五十万斤外，并决定节期在各重要路口成立供应站，指定十个国营零售商店在春节期间经营副食品业务，以加强供应工作。又如北京市现在已经储备了大批活猪、牛、羊、水果、食油，并正在继续大力组织收购、调运。例如重庆、天津、武汉、沈阳等市，也都充分准备了应节必需物资。许多私商在国营商业的组织下，也积极参加了春节的供应工作。现在，各地国营商业部门除大力组织应节物资的调运外，正在进一步检查春节供应工作的准备情况，以确实保证春节物资的充分供应。
