Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, January 1st:

    The Central Committees of the French Communist Party, the German Communist Party, and the Socialist Unity Party of Germany jointly issued a statement on January 27, calling on the people of France and Germany to unite to thwart the Bonn and Paris war treaties.

    The statement said: A new war is threatening the people of Germany and France. The purpose of the Bonn Treaty and the Paris Treaty is to establish a European aggressive army under the command of the US imperialists, revive Nazism in West Germany, and rebuild the West German Wehrmacht. The United States intends to use the Bonn Treaty and the Paris Treaty to drag West Germany into the aggressive North Atlantic Treaty Organization and turn West Germany into a base for launching new wars against the Soviet Union and the French people. This approach will inevitably lead to an arms race and deepen the poverty of the working people. The US imperialists want to use our people to realize their plan to conquer the world. Like Hitler, they preach an anti-Soviet crusade. They have found accomplices among the French and German imperialists who are selling out national interests and national independence.

    These two treaties contribute to the revival of German militarism and imperialism. German militarism and imperialism hope to gain control of Europe with the help of the United States, and once they feel they are strong enough, they will inevitably immediately re-implement their past plans of conquest. Therefore, these two treaties contain the danger of a renewed war between Germany and France.

    The statement pointed out: In order to force the implementation of their war policy under the orders of US imperialism, the reactionary imperialist forces are attempting to undermine the national resistance of our two countries and stifle the people's peace movement. That is why they are persecuting the French Communist Party and leading comrades like Duclos, as well as the German Communist Party and its chairman, Lehmann.

    The statement emphasized: The people of our two countries are eager for peace and lasting mutual understanding. The people of our two countries warmly applaud the following words of Comrade Wilhelm Pieck, President of the German Democratic Republic: "The German Democratic Republic will never allow Germans to launch a war against the French people again." The German and French people will never be mercenaries of the imperialists. They will not fight against the Soviet Union, nor will they fight against each other. The French and German people approve and support the Soviet Union's efforts for a peaceful resolution of the German question. These efforts are the result of the Soviet Union's unwavering peace policy.

    The statement then pointed out: The common goals pursued by the working people of France and Germany are: to conclude a peace treaty with Germany; to establish a peaceful, democratic, and unified Germany without Nazism and militarism; and to ensure that Germany does not participate in military alliances against another country. Our people's united struggle for peace will restore German unity and restore the security and independence of France. The existence of a peaceful, democratic, and unified Germany is the best guarantee of the security of France and other countries in Europe.

    For the people of Germany and France, in order to establish lasting peaceful relations between the two countries, it is necessary to thwart general war treaties and all other measures to prepare for aggressive wars. Our two peoples have already achieved a great victory, which has prevented the Bonn and Paris treaties from being ratified until now. As long as we strengthen our struggle, we will eventually be able to thwart these treaties.

    The statement finally called on the workers and all the people of France and Germany to work together to accomplish this historic task.

    法共、德共和德国统一社会党联合声明
    号召法德两国人民团结斗争击退战争威胁
    【新华社柏林一日电】法国共产党、德国共产党和德国统一社会党的中央委员会于一月二十七日联合发表声明，号召法德两国人民团结一致为挫败波恩和巴黎战争条约而斗争。
    声明说：一个新的战争威胁着德国和法国的人民。波恩条约和巴黎条约的目的是要在美帝国主义者指挥下成立一支欧洲侵略军，复活西德的纳粹主义和重建西德国防军。美国打算利用波恩条约和巴黎条约，把西德拖入侵略性的北大西洋公约组织，把西德变成向苏联及法国人民发动新的战争的阵地。这种做法不可避免地要产生军备竞赛并加深劳动人民的贫穷。美帝国主义者想利用我们的人民来实现他们征服全世界的计划，他们正如希特勒一样，宣扬反苏十字军。他们在出卖民族利益和国家独立的法国和德国帝国主义分子中间找到了同谋犯。
    这两个条约有助于德国军国主义和帝国主义的复活，德国军国主义与帝国主义希望在美国的援助下获得控制欧洲的优势，而且他们一旦觉得本身已经相当强大的时候，必将不可避免地立即重新实行过去的征服计划。因此，这两个条约包藏着德法两国间重新爆发战争的危险。
    声明指出：在美国帝国主义命令下的反动帝国主义势力为了要强迫贯彻他们的战争政策，正在企图破坏我们两国间的民族抵抗并扼杀人民的和平运动。这就是他们为什么对法国共产党和像杜克洛这样的领导同志以及对德国共产党和党的主席雷曼进行迫害活动的原因。
    声明强调说：我们两国人民都渴望和平与持久的互相谅解。我们两国人民都热烈地为德意志民主共和国总统威廉·皮克同志所说的下面这句话而欢呼：“德意志民主共和国决不容许德国人再对法国人民发动战争。”德国和法国人民决不作帝国主义者的雇佣兵。他们决不对苏联作战，也不相互作战。法国和德国人民赞成并支持苏联为了和平解决德国问题而作的努力。这些努力是苏联坚持不渝的和平政策的结果。
    接着声明指出：法国和德国劳动人民所争取的共同目标是：缔结对德和约；建立一个没有纳粹主义和军国主义的、爱好和平的、民主的、统一的德国；保证德国不得参加反对另一国家的军事同盟。我们人民争取和平的联合斗争将恢复德国的统一，恢复法国的安全与独立。一个爱好和平的、民主的、统一的德国的存在，就是法国安全和欧洲其他国家安全的最好保证。
    对于德国和法国人民说来，为了要建立两国间的持久和平关系，必须挫败一般性战争条约及其他一切准备侵略战争的措施。我们两国人民已经取得了一个巨大的胜利，使得波恩与巴黎条约到现在还没有被批准。只要加强我们的斗争，我们终于能挫败这些条约。
    声明最后号召法、德两国工人与全体人民共同努力，完成这个历史性的任务。
