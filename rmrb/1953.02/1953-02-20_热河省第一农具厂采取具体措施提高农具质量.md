    Rehe Province First Agricultural Implement Factory Takes Concrete Measures to Improve the Quality of Agricultural Implements

    The First Agricultural Implement Factory of Rehe Province wrote: The criticism made by Comrade Yin Zhong in the People's Daily on January 25th regarding the poor quality of the Polish-style wheel-less plow produced by our factory is correct. The main reasons for this situation are the erroneous thinking of our factory's leading cadres who emphasize quantity over quality, the lack of emphasis on producing agricultural implements among some employees, the unsound quality inspection system and quality responsibility system, and the lack of testing before manufacturing. Now our factory has taken the following measures: (1) Quality education has been conducted for employees during quality remedial training. Now employees are paying attention to promoting advanced experience in improving quality during operation, and initial results have been achieved. (2) Strengthening the inspection organization and inspection system, and determining quality inspection standards. (3) Recently, responsible cadres, technicians, and advanced production workers were organized to visit advanced agricultural implement factories to learn from advanced experiences.

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    热河省第一农具厂采取具体措施提高农具质量
    热河省第一农具厂来信：一月二十五日人民日报上尹忠同志对我厂所制波兰式无轮犁质量不好的批评是正确的。造成这种情况的主要原因是我厂领导干部有重量不重质的错误思想，部分职工有不重视生产农具的思想，质量检查制和质量责任制不健全以及制造前缺乏试验工作。现在我厂已采取下列措施：（一）质量补课中对职工进行了质量教育。现在职工在操作中注意推广改进质量的先进经验，已有了初步成绩。（二）加强检查机构和检查制度，确定质量检查标准。（三）最近组织负责干部、技术人员和先进生产工人到先进的农具厂参观，学习先进经验。
