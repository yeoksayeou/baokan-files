    Northeast China achieved significant results in basic construction last year, basically completing the tasks assigned by the state, greatly expanding the basic construction force, and gaining some preliminary experience. However, the preparatory work for basic construction last year was poorly done, the engineering quality of some units was very bad, and there was a lot of waste. There are still many problems and shortcomings in the work, and we must not be complacent or arrogant. Therefore, we should humbly learn from Soviet experts, constantly summarize experience, carry out criticism and self-criticism, examine shortcomings, and not repeat past mistakes.
    This year is the first year of the national First Five-Year Plan. The current central task is to do a good job in industrial basic construction. The entire Party in the Northeast must concentrate its efforts to complete this task entrusted by the state. Party committees and governments at all provincial and municipal levels must first conscientiously help, supervise, and inspect the heavy industrial projects in their regions that are related to the fate of the country, and coordinate, support, and help them in all aspects so that these projects can truly be done "well, quickly, and economically." This is the most important task of local party committees. Although all localities have local industries and various construction tasks, it should be clearly recognized that the most important factories and mines for national construction should be supported first. Because the construction of these factories and mines is of decisive significance to national construction; while some local industries are relatively secondary, we cannot put secondary things on the same level as things that are decisive for the fate of the country. Trade, culture, education, and other departments at the Northeast level should also consider how to cooperate with the construction of important national factories. In short, party committees and governments at all levels and departments should deploy their work around the central task of the country.
    In addition to strengthening the political and organizational leadership of basic construction departments, conscientiously organizing inspection work, and implementing the Party's policies, local party committees should currently pay attention to urging local governments and relevant departments to first do the following work:
    (1) Organize the supply of materials. Urge state-owned factories and mines, and organize local industries and private industries to complete processing and ordering tasks for basic construction departments, and regularly urge and inspect to ensure that departments undertaking processing and ordering tasks deliver goods on time and guarantee quality specifications.
    (2) Do a good job in the unified allocation of construction workers. At present, there is a force of more than 400,000 people engaged in basic construction, but in terms of regions, it is not fully adapted. Some places have too many, and some places have too few, requiring the government to do a good job in unified allocation. Everyone should have an overall concept and not think that workers cannot be moved once they are in their hands. Party organizations in various localities should reasonably guarantee the implementation of the unified allocation policy.
    (3) Governments at all levels, especially urban governments, should ensure that transportation, municipal construction, and urban planning work can well meet the requirements of basic construction.
    (4) Organize trade and cooperative departments to ensure the supply of material life for basic construction workers. This aspect has not been done well enough in the past, and we must ensure better supply in the future. The Northeast state-owned trade department should check the distribution of state-owned stores and deploy work according to the central task of the country. The suburbs of cities should develop animal husbandry and vegetable production in a planned way to ensure the supply of non-staple foods.
    (5) Organize the cultural and artistic forces of cities to serve the cultural and recreational work of basic construction workers. Harbin has good experience in this regard, which is worth learning. Various departments at the Northeast level should also pay attention to this issue.
    (6) Organize labor and health departments to cooperate with trade unions to inspect the safety and health conditions of construction sites, and urge and assist them to improve.
    (7) Assist engineering units in doing a good job in security and fire prevention.
    Regarding the issue of establishing political work organizations in basic construction departments, the experience in the Northeast region over the past year has proved that establishing political organs in basic construction departments is an important measure to strengthen basic construction work. Therefore, it should be affirmed that all engineering companies should establish political offices, and they should be strengthened. The political office is an integral part of the engineering company and should be within the company's establishment, but it also represents the party committee in doing political work and exercising the party's guarantee and supervision functions. Its task is to carry out political work, not to directly manage administrative businesses such as salaries, personnel, and welfare. Political instructors are dispatched by the political office to general construction sites, and political instructors can also be set up in construction teams at some complex construction sites. Provincial and municipal party committees should no longer set up basic construction political departments or political offices. The party committee's industrial department, propaganda department, and organization department should directly work with engineering companies and construction sites, and the basic construction section of the industrial department can be strengthened to manage daily work in this area. In short, the party committee should devote its main energy to strengthening basic construction, and all departments of the party committee should work with construction sites.
    Regarding the issue of the basic construction force to complete this year's tasks, the main issue in the Northeast region this year is not to expand the team on a large scale, but how to consolidate and improve it. We must oppose the phenomenon of blindly expanding in quantity, and we must emphasize the method of further consolidating and improving from a political, technical, and professional perspective to strengthen the basic construction force. In addition to the local party committees and governments continuing to support basic construction units in all aspects in terms of the lack of cadres, technical personnel, and special technical workers, the main thing is that basic construction departments should tap internal potential (this potential is very large), examine and correct shortcomings in their work, promote advanced experience, strengthen political work, improve the political consciousness and technical level of employees, cultivate special skills, further improve design work, construction management, and organization of labor, and further improve the labor productivity of basic construction departments.
    Regarding the issue of relying on the working class, some people currently have inappropriate understandings and views on the basic construction worker team. They believe that the basic construction workers are complex, thus reducing the degree of trust in the basic construction workers, and their education and encouragement are not enough. This is wrong. We must trust and value them, believe in their wisdom, believe in their creativity, and also believe in their enthusiasm for national construction, value their rationalization proposals, encourage their every progress, and commend the advanced figures and model deeds among them, because their interests are consistent with the interests of national industrialization. There are many new people from rural areas and small urban producers in the basic construction team. This is a fact, which only increases our responsibility to educate these new workers. Of course, we do not deny that some impure bad elements have also mixed in, but this is an individual problem, not the essential problem of the basic construction team. The essence of the basic construction team is the working class, and we should study and understand the small number of bad elements and impure elements who have mixed in, and take measures of education, transformation, and purification. Since the basic construction team itself is the working class, we must trust and value them and pay attention to their welfare and material and cultural life. Strengthening political work in basic construction departments, strengthening the political, technical, and cultural learning of basic construction workers, and strengthening the Party and League work in basic construction departments, so that basic construction workers are raised to the same political consciousness and skilled technical level as industrial workers, this is a special issue for us to implement the line of relying on the working class in basic construction departments. Since we relied on the working class to complete the task of restoring production, we must also rely on the working class to complete the task of national construction.
    Regarding learning from Soviet advanced experience, the experience of the past year has proved that it is very important to conscientiously learn and promote Soviet advanced experience. Paying attention to or not paying attention to, being serious or not being serious about learning from Soviet advanced experience is a matter of political quality. All units should carefully check their relationship with Soviet experts so that Soviet experts can play a more active, effective, and full role. At the same time, specialized institutions should be established organizationally to be responsible for collecting, researching, and promoting advanced experience.
    Regarding strengthening specific leadership, there was a bureaucratic style of leadership in basic construction work in the Northeast in the past. For example, the leading cadres of a basic construction unit in Harbin were like this: when the lower levels reported a "difficulty," he replied "overcome it," and when they reported "difficulty" again, he replied "overcome it" again. Over time, it became such a formula: the lower levels shouted "difficulty," and the upper levels replied "overcome it," and no problem could be solved. For example, in an engineering company in Qiqihar, workers did not have hot water to drink. The leadership approved the solution of providing a pot. There were many pots in the warehouse, but it still took a month to solve the problem. A middle school in Tieling County, Liaoxi, designed by an art teacher, was built on the banks of the Chaihe River, between two mountains, with beautiful scenery, but it was approved by the leadership without surveying. After the building was built, the foundation sank a lot. The art teacher did not understand construction science, coupled with the bureaucracy of the leadership, of course things would go wrong. For example, the Engineering Company of the Ministry of Trade built a joint store in the Tiexi District of Shenyang on a dried-up pond, and the auditorium of Changchun Business College was built so that the second floor could not see the stage, and so on. In order to change the above-mentioned chaotic phenomena, the leader's job should not be in the company, but should go to the site to discover problems and solve them, and hold fewer unnecessary meetings and go to the site for inspection more often. We must be conscientious, careful, meticulous, study the business, and discover and solve problems in a timely manner to ensure that basic construction is done "well, quickly, and economically" and complete the major tasks assigned to us by the country.

    林枫同志在中共中央东北局基本建设工作会议上的总结报告（摘要）
    东北去年基本建设的成绩很显著，基本上完成了国家给予的任务，大大壮大了基本建设的队伍，并摸到了一些初步的经验。但是，去年基本建设的准备工作做得很不好，有些单位的工程质量很坏，浪费不少，工作里面问题和缺点还很多，绝不能够自满和骄傲。因此应该虚心向苏联专家学习，经常总结经验，开展批评和自我批评，检查缺点，不再重复过去的错误。
    今年是国家开始五年建设计划的第一年，目前的中心任务就是要搞好工业基本建设，东北全党要集中全力来完成国家交予的这个任务。各省市党委和政府必须首先认真帮助、监督和检查自己地区里面有关国家命运的重工业工程，从各方面配合它、支援它、帮助它，使这些工程切实做到“好、快、省”。这是地方党委最重要的任务。虽然各地都有地方工业，有各种建设任务，但应明确认识首先要支援对国家建设最重要的工厂矿山。因为将这些厂矿建设好是对国家建设有决定意义的；而地方上的
    一些工业则是比较次要的，不能把次要的东西和对国家命运有决定意义的东西并列起来。东北一级的贸易和文化教育等部门，也都应考虑如何配合国家重要工厂建设的问题。总之，各地党委和政府各部门都要围绕国家的中心任务来部署自己的工作。
    地方党委除加强对基本建设部门的政治工作和组织工作的领导，认真组织检查工作和贯彻党的政策外，目前应注意督促地方政府及有关部门首先做好以下工作：
    （一）组织材料供应。督促国营厂矿和组织地方工业及私人工业为基本建设部门完成加工订货的任务，并经常督促检查，使承担加工订货任务的部门如期交货，保证质量规格。
    （二）做好建筑工人的统一调配工作。现在基本建设有四十多万人的队伍，但按地区来讲，不完全适应，有的地方多，有的地方少，需要政府做好统一调配工作。大家应该有整体观念，不要工人一到自己手里就动不得了。各地党的组织，应合情合理地保证统一调配政策的贯彻。
    （三）各级政府特别是城市政府要使交通运输、市政建设和城市的规划工作能很好地配合基本建设的要求。
    （四）组织贸易合作部门保证基本建设职工物质生活的供应。这方面过去做得很不够，今后要保证供应得更好。东北国营贸易部门应当检查一下国营商店分布的情况，根据国家的中心任务布置工作。城市郊区应有计划地发展饲畜业和菜蔬生产，以保证副食品的供应。
    （五）组织城市的文化艺术力量，为基本建设的职工文化娱乐工作服务。这方面哈尔滨有很好的经验，值得学习。东北一级各部门也要注意这个问题。
    （六）组织劳动和卫生部门协同工会检查工地的安全、卫生状况，督促和协助他们改善。
    （七）协助工程单位做好保卫工作，做好四防工作。
    关于基本建设部门建立政治工作组织问题。东北地区一年来的经验证明，在基本建设部门建立政治机关是加强基本建设工作的一项重要措施，因此应该肯定一切工程公司都要设立政治处，并且应该把它充实起来。政治处是工程公司一个组成部分，应该在公司编制之内，但它又代表党委作政治工作，实行党的保证监督职权。它的任务是进行政治工作，不是直接管理工薪、人事、福利等行政业务。一般工地由政治处派出政治指导员，有些复杂工程的工地里面的工程队，也可以设政治指导员。各省、市委不要再设基本建设政治部或者政治处，党委工业部、宣传部、组织部应该直接面向工程公司和工地进行工作，可以加强工业部的基本建设处，管理这方面的日常工作。总之，党委应把主要精力用在加强基本建设方面来，党委各部都应面向工地进行工作。
    对于完成今年任务的基本建设力量问题，在东北区今年主要不是再大量扩充队伍的问题，而是如何巩固与提高一步的问题。要反对盲目地在数量上扩大的现象，要强调用从政治上、技术上、业务上进一步巩固与提高的办法来壮大基本建设的力量。除对于基本建设单位所缺的干部、技术人员、特殊技术工人，地方党委与政府仍要从各个方面支援外，更主要的是基本建设部门要挖掘内部的潜在力量
    （这种潜在力量是很大的），检查与改正工作中的缺点，推广先进经验，加强政治工作，提高职工的政治觉悟和技术水平，培养特殊工种，进一步提高设计工作、施工管理与组织劳动力等工作，进一步提高基本建设部门的劳动生产率。
    关于依靠工人阶级的问题，目前有些人对基本建设工人队伍的认识与看法上还有不妥当的地方，认为基本建设工人复杂，因此减轻和降低了对基本建设工人的相信程度，对他们教育鼓励也就很不够。这是错误的。我们必须相信与重视他们，相信他们的智慧，相信他们的创造性，同时也相信他们对国家建设的积极性，重视他们的合理化建议，鼓励他们的每一个进步，表扬他们中的先进人物和模范事迹，因为他们的利益和国家工业化的利益是一致的。基本建设队伍中新的来自农村和城市的小生产者很多，这是事实，这只是加重了我们对这些新
    工人进行教育的责任。当然我们也不否认同时混进了一些不纯的坏分子，但这是个别问题，不是基本建设队伍的本质问题。基本建设队伍的本质是工人阶级，对混进来少数的坏分子和不纯分子应该研究了解，并采取教育改造与清洗的办法。既然基本建设队伍的本身是工人阶级，因此我们就要相信与重视他们，注意关心他们的福利与物质文化生活。加强基本建设部门中的政治工作，加强基本建设工人的政治、技术与文化学习，加强基本建设部门的党、团工作，把基本建设工人提高到与产业工人同样的政治觉悟与熟练的技术水平，这就是我们贯彻依靠工人阶级的路线在基本建设部门里面的一个特殊的问题。我们既然依靠工人阶级完成了恢复生产的任务，同样也要依靠工人阶级来完成国家的建设任务。
    关于学习苏联先进经验，去年一年的经验已经证明了：认真学习与推广苏联先进经验是非常重要的。对学习苏联先进经验注意或不注意，认真或不认真，是一个政治品质问题。各个单位要很好地检查和苏联专家的关系，使苏联专家能更积极更有效更充分地发挥作用。同时在组织上应该建立专门机构，负责搜集、研究、推广先进经验。
    关于加强具体领导的问题，过去在东北基本建设工作里面，是存在着官僚主义的领导作风。比如哈尔滨有一个基本建设单位的领导干部就是这样：下面反映一次“困难”，他答复是“克服”，再次反映“困难”，答复还是“克服”，久而久之，变成了这样个公式：下边喊“困难”，上边答“克服”，什么问题也不能解决。又比如齐齐哈尔一个工程公司，工人没有开水喝，领导上批准给解决锅，仓库里存着很多锅，结果还是拖了一个月才解决。辽西铁岭县的一个中学，经过美术教员设计，建筑在柴河之滨，两山之间，风景很好，但没有经过勘察，领导上就批准了。建筑好了以后，地基下沉很多，美术教员不懂建筑科学，再加上领导上的官僚主义，当然就要坏事。再如贸易部工程公司把沈阳铁西区联营商店修在涸水泡子上，长春商专修的礼堂二楼看不见舞台等等。为了改变上述混乱现象，领导者的工作岗位不是在公司，而应到现场去，发现问题，解决问题，少开一些不必要的会议，多到现场去检查。我们必须兢兢业业，谨慎细致，研究业务，及时发现和解决问题，才能保证把基本建设做到“又好、又快、又省”，完成国家给我们的重大任务。
