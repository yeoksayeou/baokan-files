(Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, February 24th) As early as November 26, 1952, US military aircraft violated the agreement between the two sides by bombing our No. 9 POW camp in Soonchun, which was marked with huge and obvious symbols in accordance with the agreement, injuring three POWs from the other side. General Nam Il, the chief representative of our side in the Korean Armistice Talks, lodged a serious protest on December 1, 1952. However, the other side has remained silent for three months, daring not to explain. In a letter dated February 19, 1953, the other side's chief representative, Harrison, shamelessly denied this serious crime, and shamelessly slandered and vilified our protest, which was made to safeguard humanity and the dignity of the agreement between the two sides, as a "propaganda campaign."

On February 23, General Nam Il sent a letter to Harrison, solemnly pointing out that the above-mentioned serious incident could not be concealed or whitewashed by the other side's shameless silence, denial, slander, and vilification. He demanded that the other side provide a clear explanation for the serious atrocities of bombing and strafing our POW camps nine times since the beginning of the armistice talks, killing and wounding 196 POWs from the other side, which seriously violated international law and the agreement between the two sides. General Nam Il also pointed out that the entire history of the Korean armistice talks is a record of the US side's arbitrary violation of international law and the agreement between the two sides. The US side insists on its absurd claim to detain POWs, massacres our POWs, and bombs and strafes its own POWs. The US side has unilaterally suspended the armistice talks and is increasingly seriously tearing up various administrative agreements of the armistice talks, attempting to completely destroy the maintenance of the conference area and completely break down the armistice talks. The US side's continuous crimes of violating international law and the agreement between the two sides thoroughly expose the US side's true intention to expand the Korean War. General Nam Il finally pointed out that any attempt by the US side to expand the Korean War will inevitably be met with crushing blows, and the US side will never be able to escape full responsibility for all these war crimes. The full text of General Nam Il's letter is as follows: Lieutenant General Harrison, Chief Representative of the United Nations Command Delegation:

On November 26, 1952, your side violated the agreement between the two sides by bombing our POW camp in Soonchun, which was marked with huge and obvious symbols in accordance with the agreement between the two sides, injuring three POWs from your side. After our side lodged a serious protest on December 1, 1952, regarding this serious crime, your side has remained silent for three months, daring not to explain. Now, in your letter dated February 19, 1953, you shamelessly deny this serious crime of destroying humanity, violating the agreement, and bombing your own POWs, and shamelessly slander and vilify our protest, which was made to protect the POWs in our hands and to safeguard humanity and the dignity of the agreement between the two sides, as a "propaganda campaign." In your letter, you also arrogantly attempted to restrict our right to send you letters of protest in order to evade your due responsibility for accepting our letters. All of this is obviously a clear indication of your side's attempt to deceive the world in order to further create excuses to finally and completely destroy the armistice talks. However, the serious crime of your side bombing the No. 9 POW camp in Soonchun on November 26, 1952, and injuring three POWs from your side, cannot be concealed or whitewashed by your shameless denial, slander, and rude vilification in your letter dated February 19, 1953. Since the beginning of the armistice talks alone, your side has bombed and strafed our POW camps nine times, killing 39 POWs from your side and injuring 157 POWs from your side. Your side has never made any responsible explanation for this series of serious crimes. However, shameless silence, denial, slander, and vilification cannot in the slightest way relieve your side of its full responsibility for this barbaric act that seriously violates international law and the agreement between the two sides. Your side must provide a clear explanation for the serious crime of your side bombing and strafing our POW camps on many occasions, resulting in the killing and wounding of many POWs from your side.

The entire history of the Korean armistice talks is a record of your side's arbitrary violation of international law and the agreement between the two sides. In order to obstruct the armistice talks, your side has intensified its indiscriminate bombing of peaceful towns and facilities in Korea, not hesitating to bomb and strafe your own POWs. In order to create an excuse for detaining our POWs, your side has frantically coerced our unarmed POWs and continuously massacred our POWs on a large scale. Your side has directly violated international law and the draft armistice agreement that the two sides had already reached in the armistice talks, and insisted on the unreasonable demand to forcibly detain our POWs. In order to further expand the war of aggression against Korea, your side has unilaterally suspended the armistice talks and is increasingly seriously tearing up various administrative agreements of the armistice talks, attempting to completely destroy the maintenance of the conference area and completely break down the armistice talks. It is precisely your side's continuous criminal acts of violating international law and the agreement between the two sides that have made it impossible to realize the Korean armistice, and have thoroughly exposed your side's true intention to expand the Korean War and further disrupt peace in the Far East and the world. In order to realize the urgent desire for peace of the people of the world, our side has put forward a completely fair and reasonable proposal to immediately realize the Korean armistice and hand over the issue of the repatriation of all POWs to the "Committee for the Peaceful Settlement of the Korean Question" proposed by the Soviet Union to resolve. Your side's conspiracy to tear up international law and the agreement between the two sides, and to disrupt the armistice talks in order to expand the Korean War, has aroused the anger and condemnation of peace-loving people all over the world. Any attempt by your side to expand the Korean War will inevitably be met with even more severe blows, and your side will never be able to escape full responsibility for all these war crimes.
        
        General Nam Il, Chief Representative of the Delegation of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers
        February 23, 1953

(Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, February 25th) The US side, nearly five months after suspending the Korean armistice talks, is now intensifying its sabotage of the agreement between the two sides on the conference area and other administrative agreements, because only these agreements still mark the remnants of the armistice talks, and thus hinder the US side's plan to completely strangle peace in Korea.

On the afternoon of February 22, US military aircraft again violated the agreement by intruding into the Panmunjom conference area in three consecutive batches within one hour. The weather was clear at the time, and the two batches of US aircraft that intruded even attacked our nearby positions from above the conference area. When the two sides conducted a joint investigation, even a US military policeman admitted that he had seen a US aircraft fly over the conference area, and even drew a route map of the flight himself. However, at today's liaison officer meeting, the US liaison officer completely denied what this US military policeman had said and the map he had drawn. Such shameless denial can only be interpreted as a way for the US side to intensify its sabotage of the agreement.

The recent public declaration by the US liaison officer that overflights do not violate the agreement has further aggravated the vicious intent of the US aircraft to continuously intrude into the conference area. This indicates that the US side is no longer satisfied with conspiring to sabotage, but is preparing to openly tear up the conference area agreement. However, empty denial cannot in the slightest way alleviate the responsibility of the US side. Because flying over the conference area is not only explicitly prohibited by the agreement between the two sides, but the US side has also explicitly stated that it was a violation of the agreement when it admitted on more than ten occasions in the past that aircraft had intruded into the conference area. As recently as December 28 of last year, US liaison officer McCaslin said in a letter to our side acknowledging that a US aircraft had flown over the conference area: "Expresses regret for these violations." On August 13 of last year, McCaslin also said in another letter: "If the responsible pilot can be identified, disciplinary measures will be taken."

The US side has adopted an irresponsible delaying attitude towards some other recent incidents of violating the agreement. On February 10, armed personnel under US control intruded into the conference area and set fire to it, and on February 12, they even wounded one of our military policemen in the conference area. Although our side has lodged protests and repeatedly urged explanations, the US side has remained silent. In addition, before unilaterally tearing up the agreement between the two sides on the immunity from attack of the delegation's supply convoy, the US side dispatched aircraft to strafe the vehicles of our delegation on January 21, injuring three members of our delegation. More than a month has passed since this serious provocative incident, and the US side still maintains criminal silence. This method of refusing to deal with incidents of violating the agreement and deliberately delaying them is clearly another method in the US side's plan to tear up the agreement.

Simultaneous with these provocative incidents, US Chief Representative Harrison has even hinted that the US side will continue to bomb our POW camps and massacre their own POWs. In a recent letter responding to General Nam Il's protest against the US bombing of the Soonchun POW camp, Harrison said: "I cannot seriously consider your request." General Nam Il's request to Harrison was:

"Your side strictly abides by international law and the agreement between the two sides so that similar incidents do not happen again." In his letter to Nam Il, Harrison even attempted to restrict our right to send letters of protest to the US side. Harrison is unwilling to come to Panmunjom, and the armistice talks have gone from repeated absenteeism to suspending meetings. Now he is even starting to express his unwillingness to accept correspondence from Panmunjom. Harrison's intention is clearly to completely and thoroughly disrupt the Korean armistice talks. In his letter, Harrison attempted to deceive the people of the world and shift the responsibility for refusing to stop the war, but the various facts of the US side's sabotage of the armistice have made his weak propaganda efforts completely bankrupt under General Nam Il's righteous and stern accusations in his February 23 reply.

(Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, February 25th) The incidents of US military aircraft violating the Korean armistice talks conference area agreement and intruding into the airspace of the conference area three times at 14:05, 14:40, and 15:10 on February 22 have been confirmed by the joint investigation of the security officers of both sides in the conference area. One of the witnesses, the other side's military police officer, also admitted that US military aircraft had flown over the conference area. At the liaison officer meeting on February 19, our chief liaison officer protested to the other side and demanded that the other side strictly abide by the agreement so that similar incidents would not happen again. However, the US side deliberately and thoroughly disrupted the maintenance of the conference area, and more and more shamelessly lied to our faces, claiming that the joint investigation by the security officers of both sides did not determine that the other side's aircraft did indeed fly over the conference area at that time, and that even if the other side's aircraft did fly over, it did not violate the agreement. Our chief liaison officer then cited the testimony of the military police of both sides in the conference area during the above-mentioned joint investigation, which proved that the other side's aircraft did indeed fly over at that time, exposing the US side's shameless denial on the spot. Our side also cited the clear provisions in the agreement and understanding between the two sides, proving that the overflight of military aircraft in the conference area undoubtedly constituted a violation of the agreement. Our side finally pointed out that no matter how the other side tries to deny it, the other side can never escape full responsibility for violating the agreement. At this meeting, our side once again urged the other side to quickly explain the incident of the US military aircraft attacking our delegation's vehicles and injuring three members of our delegation on January 21, as well as the incidents on February 10 and February 12, when armed personnel under US control twice intruded into the conference area and set fire to civilian houses, and openly attacked our military police, injuring one of our military police officers. However, the US side obviously had ulterior motives, and has repeatedly adopted a delaying attitude towards these serious violations of the agreement that our side has already protested, claiming that it is still conducting investigations, and has not made any explanations.

    南日将军严斥美方抵赖轰炸我方战俘营
    美方加紧破坏双方关于会场区的协议和其他行政协议
    【新华社开城二十四日电】早在一九五二年十一月二十六日，美方军用飞机破坏双方协议，轰炸按双方协议设有巨大明显标志的我方顺川第九号战俘营，打伤对方被俘人员三名。朝鲜停战谈判我方首席代表南日将军在一九五二年十二月一日就提出了严重抗议。但对方三个月来一直噤不作声，不敢交代。一九五三年二月十九日，对方首席代表哈利逊来信，竟矢口抵赖这一严重罪行，并无耻诬赖和谩骂我方为维护人道和双方协议的尊严而提出的抗议是“宣传行动”。
    二月二十三日，南日将军致函哈利逊，严正指出上述严重事件决非对方无耻的沉默、抵赖、诬蔑和谩骂所能掩饰与洗刷，并要求对方对于停战谈判开始以来九次轰炸扫射我方各战俘营，杀伤对方被俘人员一百九十六名的严重违反国际公法与双方协议的暴行，作出明确的交代。南日将军并指出整个朝鲜停战谈判的历史就是美方恣意破坏国际公法与双方协议的记录，美方坚持扣留战俘的荒谬主张，屠杀我方被俘人员，并轰炸扫射他们自己的被俘人员。美方更片面中断停战谈判，日益严重地撕毁停战谈判各项行政协议，企图彻底破坏会场区的维持，使停战谈判完全破裂。美方这种不断破坏国际公法和双方协议的罪行，彻底揭露了美方扩大朝鲜战争的真正目的。南日将军最后指出，美方扩大朝鲜战争的任何企图，将必然遭到粉碎性的打击，而美方将永远不能逃脱这一切战争罪行的完全责任。南日将军的信全文如下：联合国军代表团首席代表哈利逊中将：
    你方一九五二年十一月二十六日破坏双方协议，轰炸我方按照双方协议设有巨大明显标志的顺川战俘营，打伤你方被俘人员三名。对于这一严重罪行，经我方在一九五二年十二月一日提出严重抗议之后，你方三个月以来一直噤不作声，不敢交代。现在你一九五三年二月十九日的来信，竟矢口抵赖你方这一摧毁人道、破坏协议、轰炸你方自己的被俘人员的严重罪行，并无耻诬赖和谩骂我方为了保护在我方手中的战俘，为了维护人道和双方协议的尊严而提出的抗议是“宣传行动”。你在来信中并狂妄企图限制我方向你去信提出抗议的权利，来规避你应有的接受我方去信的责任。这一切显然是你方企图借此欺骗世人，以便你方进一步制造借口，来最后彻底破坏停战谈判的明白表示。但是一九五二年十一月二十六日，你方轰炸顺川第九号战俘营，打伤你方被俘人员三名的严重罪行，决非你在一九五三年二月十九日来信中的无耻抵赖、诬蔑和无礼谩骂所能掩饰与洗刷。仅自停战谈判开始以来，你方就曾九次轰炸扫射我方战俘营，打死你方被俘人员三十九名，打伤你方被俘人员一百五十七名。你方对这一连串的严重罪行从未作过任何负责的交代。但无耻的沉默、抵赖、诬蔑与谩骂，丝毫不能为你方卸脱对这种严重违反国际公法与双方协议的野蛮行为的完全责任。你方必须对你方历次轰炸扫射我方战俘营，以致杀伤你方被俘人员多名的严重罪行，作出明显的交代。
    整个朝鲜停战谈判的历史，就是你方恣意破坏国际公法与双方协议的记录。你方为了阻挠停战谈判，加紧狂轰滥炸朝鲜的和平城镇与设备，不惜轰炸扫射你方自己的被俘人员。你方为了制造扣留我方被俘人员的借口，疯狂胁迫手无寸铁的我方被俘人员，不断大规模地屠杀我方被俘人员。你方直接违反了国际公法和停战谈判中双方已经达成协议的停战协定草案，坚持强迫扣留我方被俘人员的无理主张。为了进一步扩大侵朝战争，你方更片面中断了停战谈判，日益严重地撕毁停战谈判的各项行政协议，企图彻底破坏会场区的维持，使停战谈判完全破裂。正是你方这种不断破坏国际公法和双方协议的罪恶行为，使朝鲜停战不能实现，而彻底揭露了你方扩大朝鲜战争，进一步破坏远东与世界和平的真正目的。我方为了实现全世界人民迫切的和平愿望，已经提出了立即实现朝鲜停战，将战俘全部遣返问题交由苏联所提的“和平解决朝鲜问题委员会”去解决的完全公平合理的建议。你方撕毁国际公法和双方协议，破坏停战谈判，以便扩大朝鲜战争的阴谋，已经引起了全世界爱好和平的人民的愤怒与谴责。任何你方扩大朝鲜战争的企图，将必然遭到更严重的打击，而你方将永远不能逃脱这一切战争罪行的完全责任。
        朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军代表团
                        首席代表南日将军
                    一九五三年二月二十三日
    【新华社开城二十五日电】美方在中断朝鲜停战谈判近五个月后，现正加紧破坏双方关于会场区的协议和其它行政协议，因为只有这些协议还标志着停战谈判的残存，因而也阻挠着美方完全扼杀朝鲜和平的计划。
    二月二十二日下午，美方军用飞机又破坏协议，在一个小时内连续三批侵入板门店会场区。当时天气晴朗，入侵的两批美机甚至自会场区上空对附近的我方阵地进行攻击。当双方进行共同调查时，连一个美方的军事警察也曾承认看到一架美机飞越会场区，而且还亲手画出飞越的路线图。但是在今天的联络官会议上，美方联络官竟完全否认这个美方军事警察说的话和绘的图。这样的无耻抵赖，只能被解释为美方加紧破坏协议的一种办法。
    最近美方联络官公开宣称飞越并不违反协议，更加重了美机连续入侵会场区的恶毒意图。因为这表示美方已不满足于阴谋破坏，而是准备要公开撕毁会场区协议了。但是空口抵赖丝毫不能减轻美方的责任。因为飞越会场区不但为双方协议所明确禁止，就是美方在过去十次以上承认飞机侵入会场区时也明确地说过那是对协议的违反。近如去年十二月二十八日，美方联络官麦卡塞在一封向我方承认美机飞越会场区的信中说：“对这些违反事件表示遗憾。”去年八月十三日，麦卡塞在另一封信上并且说：“如果可以确定应行负责的驾驶员，当采取纪律措施。”
    对最近的另一些破坏协议事件，美方采取了不负责任的拖延态度。二月十日，美方控制下的武装人员侵入会场区纵火，二月十二日更在会场区打伤我方军事警察一名。虽早经我方提出抗议，并一再催促交代，而美方却一直噤不作声。此外，美方在片面撕毁双方关于代表团供应车队免受攻击的协议前，曾于一月二十一日派遣飞机扫射我方代表团车辆，打伤我方代表团工作人员三人。对于这一严重挑衅事件，事过一月，美方仍保持着犯罪的缄默。这种对违反协议事件拒不处理，有意拖延的办法，显然是美方撕毁协议计划中的另一个办法。
    与这些挑衅事件同时，美方首席代表哈利逊更暗示美方将继续轰炸我方的战俘营，屠杀他们自己的战俘。在最近一封答复南日将军抗议美方轰炸顺川战俘营的信里，哈利逊说：“我不可能严肃地考虑你的要求。”南日将军对哈利逊提出的要求是：
    “你方严格遵守国际公法与双方协议，使类似事件不再发生。”哈利逊在给南日的信中，甚至企图限制我方向美方去信提出抗议的权利。哈利逊不愿意到板门店来，停战谈判曾经由一再逃会进而中断会议，现在他连板门店的信件来往也开始表示不愿意接受了。哈利逊的意图显然是要完全地彻底地破坏朝鲜停战谈判。哈利逊在他的信里企图欺骗世界人民，转嫁拒绝停战的责任，但是美方破坏停战的种种事实，使他这一脆弱的宣传努力，在南日将军二十三日复信里义正词严的指责下彻底地破产了。
    【新华社开城二十五日电】二月二十二日十四时零五分、十四时四十分与十五时十分，美方军用飞机又违反朝鲜停战谈判会场区协议，三次侵入会场区上空事件，已经会场区双方安全军官的共同调查所证实，作为证人之一的对方军事警察，也承认了美方军用飞机飞越会场区的事件。二月十九日双方联络官会议上，我方首席联络官向对方提出抗议，并要求对方严格遵守协议，使类似的事件不再发生。但美方蓄意彻底破坏会场区的维持，并越来越无耻地当面撒谎，诡称双方安全军官的共同调查并未确定当时确有对方飞机飞越会场区，即使对方飞机确曾飞越，也不违反协议。我方首席联络官乃引用会场区双方军事警察在上述共同调查时证明当时确有对方飞机飞越的证词，当场揭穿美方的无耻抵赖。我方并引用双方的协议与谅解中的明白规定，证明军用飞机飞越会场区毫无疑义地构成违反协议事件。我方最后指出，不论对方如何设法抵赖，对方决不能逃脱破坏协议的全部责任。在这一次会议上，我方再次催促对方迅速交代一月二十一日美方军用飞机攻击我方代表团车辆，打伤我方代表团工作人员三人的事件，以及二月十日和二月十二日，美方控制下的武装人员两次侵入会场区纵火烧毁民房，并公然袭击我方军事警察，打伤我方军事警察一人的事件。但美方显然别有用心，对这些我方早已提出抗议的严重违反协议事件，一次又一次地采取拖延态度，诿称仍在从事调查，而不作交代。
