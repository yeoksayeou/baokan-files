    Open Fire on the Barbaric Behavior of Suppressing Correspondents' Criticism

    In our country's political life, the important role of correspondents is fully proven, just as Stalin said in his conversation with the staff of the "Worker Correspondent" magazine, "They are first of all the revealers of the shortcomings of our Soviet society, the fighters who struggle to eliminate these shortcomings, and the commanders of proletarian public opinion." Through the criticism of shortcomings and errors in our various tasks by correspondents, the party newspaper not only closely connects the party newspaper with the masses and reality, consolidates the party's connection with the people, and ensures the democratization of the party and the state, but also enables the party and the people's government to understand the situation and problems in the work in a timely manner, which is convenient for improving the work. The experience of all newspapers in the past has also proved this important role of the vast number of correspondents.

    However, some people regard the correspondents as "thorns in their side" because the correspondents criticized their shortcomings or mistakes, and do not hesitate to abuse their power to suppress, attack, and retaliate. In the past three months, the "Mei Fangting Incident," "Zhu Min Incident," "Liu Shouben Incident," "Bai Chunxi Incident," and "Fu Zhongkui Incident," revealed by Shanghai Liberation Daily, Xi'an Masses Daily, Heilongjiang Daily, Shandong Dazhong Daily, and Zhejiang Daily, are a few examples of suppressing correspondents' criticism.

    These incidents show that some cadres' treatment of correspondents' criticism completely violates the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Launching Criticism and Self-Criticism in Newspapers and Periodicals" and adopts extremely despicable means. When they see criticism, they slam the table and scold; "investigate" the writer, falsely accusing them of "disorganization and lack of discipline" or "anti-leadership"; create "public opinion," using both soft and hard tactics, "individual talks," coercing "corrections"; and even take the opportunity to retaliate, not hesitating to frame good people and fabricate some "unwarranted" "counter-revolutionary" charges, hold meetings to struggle, arrest and detain. This phenomenon is absolutely intolerable.

    The reason why these suppressors of criticism dare to act so recklessly is inseparable from the weakness of some local party newspapers and party committees. They did not adopt a firm revolutionary attitude to protect the correspondents who were suppressed and attacked, and they did not dare to drag the bad deeds of the bad guys who suppressed and attacked the correspondents into the sunlight. Therefore, in order to launch an effective struggle against the barbaric behavior of suppressing correspondents' criticism, we must first correct the attitude of the party newspapers and party committees towards correspondents' criticism.

    First, the newspaper editorial department must always adopt a revolutionary attitude of warmly welcoming and actively protecting the mass criticisms reflected by the correspondents. We must not only oppose the attitude of "pushing it out" by the Zhejiang "Farmer Masses" newspaper, which forwarded the correspondents' letters of criticism to the criticized, but also oppose the bureaucratic attitude of the Heilongjiang Daily and the Shandong "Rural Masses" newspaper, which did not feel angry or support the correspondents for a long time being attacked. This bureaucratic attitude of ignoring correspondents' opinions is relatively common in newspaper editorial departments across the country, and has not been thoroughly corrected for a long time. The reason for this is that there are many difficulties in handling critical letters and manuscripts (such as the authenticity and accuracy of the criticism, etc.), but the main reason is that many editors in the editorial department regard handling critical manuscripts as a "trouble" and a "burden," fearing responsibility; especially when criticizing fairly responsible cadres, they are even more worried and dare not make public exposure. Therefore, to launch a struggle against the suppressors of criticism, the party newspaper editorial department must thoroughly correct this erroneous thinking of the editors and bravely take the responsibility of protecting the correspondents. Comrade Stalin taught us: "Protecting one's correspondents from persecution should be the responsibility of the newspaper itself, because only the newspaper can stir up a violent expository agitation to oppose reactionary obscurantism." (Conversation with the staff of the "Worker Correspondent" magazine)

    According to Comrade Stalin's instruction, the party newspaper editorial department should not only be responsible for protecting the correspondents, but also be able to stir up violent expository agitation. However, many of our party newspapers often wait until things are handled before exposing the barbaric behavior of the suppressors of criticism, and when exposing them, they lack intense agitation and profound criticism. For example, one of the most common excuses used by the suppressors of correspondents' criticism is "disorganization and lack of discipline." Then our party newspaper should not only make objective reports, but also strictly criticize it ideologically, and explain to them and all the people why correspondents, whether they are party members or non-party members, are not "disorganized and undisciplined" when writing critical manuscripts to the party newspaper. The Constitution of the Communist Party of China stipulates the rights of party members: "To participate in free and practical discussions on the implementation of the party's policies at party meetings or in party publications." "To make suggestions and statements to any organ of the party up to the Central Committee." This is, of course, without exception for every Communist Party member. In the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Launching Criticism and Self-Criticism in Newspapers and Periodicals" promulgated on April 19, 1950, it was also clearly stipulated that it is necessary to "attract the people to openly criticize the shortcomings and errors in our work in newspapers and periodicals," and it is stipulated that "no one shall abuse their power to suppress the criticism of workers and peasants correspondents in newspapers and periodicals, or retaliate against them." This is without exception not only for Communist Party members, but also for non-Communist Party members. This is the unshakable principle of our party regarding launching criticism and self-criticism inside and outside the party. Therefore, it is not "disorganization and lack of discipline" at all for correspondents to criticize anyone or any organ in the party newspaper. On the contrary, the actions of those who violate this principle and suppress correspondents' criticism are truly "disorganized and undisciplined." For example, another common excuse used by the suppressors of correspondents' criticism is that the correspondents' criticism is "undermining the prestige of the leadership." Then, our party newspaper should point out to them and all the people that the reason why they say this is not because this criticism will really undermine the interests of the country and the party, but because the ugly things they have done have been dragged into the sunlight, which is detrimental to their "dignity." We must thoroughly dig out the most dirty things in the minds of these people in order to break their excuses and make them nowhere to hide, in order to inspire the people to bravely participate in the struggle against all bad people and bad things.

    Second, party organizations at all levels must actively lead and support the work of correspondents. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China stipulates in the "Decision on Launching Criticism and Self-Criticism in Newspapers and Periodicals": "The work of workers and peasants correspondents, in addition to being led by newspapers, should also be assisted by the party organizations of the production units to which they belong. The activities of workers and peasants correspondents should be listed as one of the items for checking newspaper work and the party work of each production unit." In order to resolutely protect correspondents from persecution and eliminate the illegal and undisciplined phenomenon of suppressing criticism, the Party Central Committee also stipulated in the same decision: "If the criticized person refuses to express their attitude or attacks the critic, the Party Discipline Inspection Committee shall deal with it. The part of the above-mentioned circumstances that violates administrative discipline and laws shall be handled by the state supervision organs and judicial organs." This shows that party organizations and government organs at all levels are not only responsible for assisting correspondents in their work, but also responsible for taking effective measures to protect correspondents from persecution. Comrade Malenkov said in his report to the 19th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party: "It is wrong to think that bottom-up criticism can unfold automatically in a spontaneous way. Only when everyone who makes healthy criticism can be sure that he can get the support of our organization, and that the shortcomings he points out will be truly eliminated, can bottom-up criticism unfold and expand." Then, it is not difficult to understand that it is a basic condition for party committees at all levels to resolutely protect correspondents from being suppressed and attacked, in order to carry out bottom-up criticism. Only when correspondents are sure that they can get the support of our party organization, can bottom-up criticism in newspapers unfold; and only when those who are accustomed to suppressing and persecuting correspondents are sure that their behavior is illegal and that the party will never tolerate it, will they dare not act recklessly, and will they be able to turn to adopting a sincere attitude towards criticism and end their attempts and barbaric behavior of persecuting correspondents.

    "Persecuting workers and peasants correspondents is a barbaric act and the remnant of bourgeois habits." (Quoted from Stalin's conversation with the staff of the "Worker Correspondent" magazine) Therefore, it is impossible to completely eliminate it by relying on persuasion and education alone. At the same time, there are still many serious illegal and undisciplined cases in various places that have not been completely exposed. This requires party newspapers, party committees, and the broad masses of people and correspondents in various places to continue to carry forward the spirit of revolutionary struggle and treat those who suppress correspondents' criticism as "dead enemies of the party and carry out a relentless struggle against them."

### 向压制通讯员批评的野蛮行为开火

    向压制通讯员批评的野蛮行为开火
    在我们国家的政治生活中，完全证明通讯员的重大作用，正如斯大林在与“工人通讯员”杂志工作人员的谈话中所说的“他们首先是我们苏维埃社会缺点底揭发者，是为消灭这些缺点而斗争的战士，是无产阶级舆论底指挥官。”党报经过通讯员对我们各种工作中缺点和错误的批评，不仅密切了党报和群众和实际的联系，巩固了党与人民群众的联系，保障了党和国家的民主化，而且使党和人民政府及时了解了工作中的情况和问题，便于改进工作。过去所有报纸的经验，也都证明了广大通讯员的这种重要作用。
    但是，有一部分人就因为通讯员批评了他们的缺点或错误，而把通讯员看成“眼中钉”，不惜滥用权力实行压制、打击和报复。近三月来，上海解放日报、西安群众日报、黑龙江日报、山东大众日报和浙江日报所揭发的“梅芳庭事件”、“朱珉事件”、“刘守本事件”、“柏春溪事件”、“傅忠奎事件”等，就是压制通讯员批评的几个事例。
    这些事件表明，某些干部对待通讯员的批评，完全违反了中共中央“关于在报纸刊物上展开批评和自我批评的决定”，而采取了极其卑劣的手段。他们看到批评，拍案大骂；“追查”写稿人，诬以“无组织无纪律”或“反领导”；制造“舆论”，软硬兼施，“个别谈话”，胁迫“更正”；甚至伺机报复，不惜诬陷好人制造一些“莫须有”“反革命”的罪名，开会斗争，逮捕扣押。这种现象，是绝对不能容忍的。
    这些压制批评者所以胆敢这样胡作非为，是和某些地方党报和党委的软弱分不开的。他们对待受到压制和打击的通讯员，没有采取坚决保护的革命态度，他们不敢把压制和打击通讯员的坏人所做的坏事，拖到日光下来。因此，为了向压制通讯员批评的野蛮行为展开有效的斗争，首先就必须端正党报和党委对待通讯员批评的态度。
    第一，报纸编辑部必须对通讯员所反映的群众的批评意见，经常采取热情欢迎和积极保护的革命态度。我们既要反对像浙江“农民大众”报那样把通讯员批评信转到被批评者手里的“推出去了事”的态度，也要反对像黑龙江日报、山东“农村大众”报那样对通讯员长时间遭受打击不感觉愤恨、不加以支持的官僚主义态度。这种漠视通讯员意见的官僚主义态度，在各地报纸编辑部是比较普遍存在的，并且长时间没有得到彻底纠正。其原因固然也在于处理批评性的来信来稿有很多困难（如批评的真实性、准确性等等），但主要的原因还在于编辑部不少编辑人员把处理批评稿看作是一种“麻烦”、“包袱”，怕负责任；特别是在批评到相当负责的干部时，更有顾虑，不敢进行公开揭露。因此，要向压制批评者展开斗争，党报编辑部就必须彻底纠正编辑人员中的这种错误思想，勇敢地负起保护通讯员的责任。斯大林同志教导我们说：“保护自己的通讯员不受迫害，应当由报纸本身负责，因为只有报纸才能掀起剧烈的揭发性的鼓动，来反对反动的蒙昧主义。”（与“工人通讯员”杂志工作人员的谈话）
    依据斯大林同志的这一指示，党报编辑部不但要负责保护通讯员，而且要能够掀起剧烈的揭发性的鼓动。可是我们的不少党报对于压制批评者的野蛮行为，往往是等待事情处理后才揭发，而在揭发时，又很缺乏剧烈的鼓动和深刻的批判。例如，压制通讯员批评者最惯用的借口之一，是“无组织无纪律”。那么我们的党报就不应只作客观的报道，而应从思想上加以严格的批判，并向他们和所有人民群众说明为什么通讯员无论是党员或非党员，向党报写批评稿都不是“无组织无纪律”的道理。中国共产党党章关于党员的权利规定：“在党的会议或党的刊物上，参加关于党的政策的实施问题之自由的切实的讨论。”“向党的任何机关直至中央提出建议和声明。”这对于每一个共产党员当然是毫无例外的。一九五○年四月十九日中共中央公布的“关于在报纸刊物上展开批评和自我批评的决定”中，又明确规定，必须“吸引人民群众在报纸刊物上公开地批评我们工作中的缺点和错误”，并规定“任何人不得滥用权力压制工农通讯员在报纸刊物上的批评，或加以报复。”这就不但对于共产党员，而且对于非共产党员都是毫无例外的了。这是我们党关于在党内外展开批评和自我批评的不可动摇的原则。因此，通讯员在党报上批评任何人、任何机关，都完全不是什么“无组织无纪律”。相反的，违背这一原则而压制通讯员批评的人的行动，才是真正的“无组织无纪律”。再如，压制通讯员批评者另一个惯用的借口，就是说通讯员的批评是“破坏领导威信”。那么，我们的党报就应该向他们和所有人民群众指明，他们之所以这样说，并不是因为这种批评真的会破坏国家的和党的利益，而是因为他们自己做的丑事被拖到太阳光下面来了，有损于他们的“尊严”。我们对这些人的思想上最肮脏的东西，必须予以彻底挖掘，才能打破他们的一切借口，使他们无处藏身，才能激励人民群众奋勇参加对一切坏人坏事的斗争。
    第二，各级党的组织，必须对通讯员的工作进行积极的领导和支持。中共中央在“关于在报纸刊物上展开批评和自我批评的决定”中规定：“工农通讯员的工作，除由报纸领导外，并应由所属生产单位的党的组织加以协助。工农通讯员的活动状况，应列为检查报纸工作和各生产单位党的工作的项目之一。”为了坚决保护通讯员不受迫害，并清除压制批评的违法乱纪现象，党中央在同一决定中又规定：“如被批评者拒绝表示态度，或对批评者加以打击，即应由党的纪律检查委员会予以处理。上述情事触犯行政纪律法律的部分，应由国家监察机关司法机关予以处理。”这说明各地党的组织以及政府机关不仅有责任协助通讯员工作，而且有责任采取有效措施保护通讯员不受迫害。马林科夫同志在联共第十九次代表大会上的报告中说：“以为自下而上的批评能够以自流的方式自动展开的看法，是错误的。只有在每一个提出健康的批评的人能够确实知道他可以得到我们组织的支持，确实知道他所指出的缺点会真正予以消除的时候，自下而上的批评才能展开和扩大。”那末，不难明白，各级党委要坚决保护通讯员不受到压制和打击，是开展自下而上的批评的起码条件。只有通讯员确实知道他们可以得到我们党的组织的支持时，在报纸上的自下而上的批评才能展开；也只有当那些惯于压制和迫害通讯员的人，确实知道他们的行为是犯法的，是党所决不能容忍的时候，他们才不敢胡作非为，才有可能转向采取诚恳对待批评的态度，终止他们迫害通讯员的企图和野蛮行为。
    “迫害工农通讯员是野蛮行为，是资产阶级习气底残余。”（引自斯大林与“工人通讯员”杂志工作人员的谈话）因此，光靠说服教育还是不可能彻底消除它的。同时目前各地还有不少严重的违法乱纪事例，尚未完全被揭发出来。这就有待于各地党报、党委以及广大人民群众和通讯员，继续发扬革命的斗争精神，把那些压制通讯员批评的人，“当作党的死敌，与之进行无情的斗争”。（马林科夫）
