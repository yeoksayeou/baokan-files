Editor's Note: The fact that the leading organs of Fushan County, based on materials reported by the masses, arrested the counter-revolutionary element Zhong Jikuan, who had infiltrated the Communist Party organization and usurped the township government for three years, powerfully illustrates the importance of strengthening the handling of people's letters. Over the past three years, the masses have repeatedly accused Zhong Jikuan of his crimes to the county and district. If the county and district cadres could have humbly listened to the people's opinions, this case could have been clarified long ago. However, the leading cadres of Fushan County and the Sixth District of the county turned a deaf ear to the people's opinions, allowing reactionary elements to undermine our revolutionary cause, resulting in serious losses to the cause of the Party and the people. Their bureaucratic style has reached an intolerable level. We believe that Fushan County should continue to vigorously strengthen the work of handling people's letters and give necessary punishment to the cadres who have seriously neglected their duties in this case.

The Party and government leading organs of Fushan County, Shandong Province, organized all cadres to study the instructions of the State Council of the Central People's Government and the Shandong Provincial People's Government on strengthening the handling of people's letters and receiving people, in connection with the "Zhang Shunyou Incident" and the "Han Sheng Incident" in October last year, and began to change the bureaucratic style of neglecting people's letters. In December of last year, based on materials reported by the masses, the counter-revolutionary element Zhong Jikuan, who had usurped the township government for three years and infiltrated the Communist Party organization, was arrested.

Zhong Jikuan is a landlord in Zaolin Township, Sixth District, Fushan County, and is forty years old this year. At the age of twenty, he began to collude with local reactionary forces and bandits, oppressed the masses, and participated in the reactionary "Anqing Gang." In 1944, Zhong Jikuan infiltrated the state-owned Luqiao Store and joined the Communist Party in the same year. In 1947, when Chiang Kai-shek launched a large-scale civil war, he openly colluded with the enemy and attacked our army. He himself served as the captain of the Fourth Squadron of the puppet police brigade, threatening and luring the then village cadres Liu Shuhe, Zhang Guilin, and soldiers Shi Zhong'an, Liu Wenshan, and others to join the puppet police team as members, and seized sixteen large guns stored by our army in Zaolin Village, arming the puppet police team he led, and calculated the return of 36 mu of land that had been calculated in 1946 from the peasants. Then he went to Gugou Village in the Seventh District to carry out counter-revolutionary activities, and later handed over the armed forces to the puppet county government. After the liberation of Fushan in 1949, he returned to his hometown, wooed cadres in the village, pretended to be progressive, and often helped the village government to work, in order to cover up his crimes, and re-infiltrated the Communist Party organization. In 1950, during the land reform, he took the opportunity to become the township head and presided over the land reform. Then he carried out conspiratorial activities, wooed backward elements, formed factions, attacked activists, and systematically undermined the policies of the Party and the People's Government, alienating the relationship between the Party and the masses. He implemented attacks on cadres who adhered to justice and worked actively, adding the crime of "suspected spies" to those who fought against him, isolating these people among the masses and preventing them from playing an active role in their work. In this way, he turned the Zaolin Township government into a fortress for maintaining the landlord class and counter-revolutionary elements. For example, Chiang Kai-shek's secret agent Zhong Zhaojie led the Bandit Hu Police Brigade to rob our militia of ten rifles and more than 20,000 catties of public grain in October 1946. During the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, he was reported by the masses, but Zhong Jikuan released Zhong Zhaojie under the pretext that "the suppression of counter-revolutionaries is over, so don't mention it again." Huang Shuting, a puppet township soldier, raped women and young girls by relying on the power of the enemy in 1947 and often beat and scolded the masses. The masses hated him to the bone and demanded that the People's Government arrest him and bring him to justice, but Zhong Jikuan said that Huang was "not qualified" and released Huang again in November last year. These counter-revolutionary elements are still at large. Zhong Jikuan also often beat and scolded the masses and arbitrarily fired guns to threaten the masses. Starting from the love of the Party and the People's Government, the masses in Zaolin Township collected materials on Zhong Jikuan's reactionary behavior and sent representatives to the district and county to accuse him. From 1950 to 1952, they went to the district to accuse him four times, to the county to accuse him three times, and to the district to verbally accuse him more than ten times; however, the county and district cadres never paid attention to the accusations of the masses and delayed the investigation. District leader Zhang Xiyao said extremely wrongly: "Township cadres should be criticized less. Whoever criticizes the township and village cadres will be held responsible." Tang Honghai, a demobilized soldier from Zaolin Village, reported Zhong Jikuan's reactionary activities to the district, but was criticized by the district cadres. The district cadres said: "Although Zhong Jikuan has problems, Tang Honghai is not good either. Although Zhong Jikuan has problems, he can still do his work. Which cadre has no problems?" Under the protection of the district cadres, the arrogance of the reactionary element Zhong Jikuan became increasingly rampant. The masses were extremely dissatisfied with the government, and production enthusiasm gradually declined. Some people said: Forget it! Can the arm twist the thigh? If we sue again, I am afraid we will get ourselves into trouble! It was not until early November last year that the county leading organs, based on materials reported by the masses, sent an inspection team to the township to check the materials when Zhong Jikuan continued to carry out activities. He scolded Huang Xiuqi, the secretary of the township branch of the Youth League (because Huang had reported him to the county once), on the street, saying: "I am a party member. I handed the gun over to the enemy. You watch what happens!" He also convened a meeting of the township government committee members and the party branch (without calling the party members and cadres who had reported him to participate), and arranged for his cronies to try to attack the cadres and masses who had reported him. In November last year, under the instructions of the higher authorities, the leading organs of Fushan County inspected and strengthened the work of handling people's letters, cleared up the backlog of people's letters in the past, and took the problem of the masses reporting Zhong Jikuan as the focus. They sent Lang Xiuhua, deputy director of the People's Supervision Committee of the county, and others to organize an inspection team to go to Zaolin Township for in-depth inspection, and only then did they find out the complete facts of Zhong Jikuan's reactionary activities. With the approval of the higher authorities, Zhong Jikuan was arrested and brought to justice in December last year. After Zhong Jikuan was arrested, the masses in Zaolin Township were all delighted.

    凫山县领导干部忽视群众来信造成恶果
    该县早林乡乡政权竟被反革命分子篡夺三年最近才破案
    编者按：凫山县领导机关根据群众检举的材料，逮捕了钻入共产党组织、篡夺乡政权三年的反革命分子仲跻宽的事实，有力地说明了加强处理人民来信工作的重要性。三年中，群众曾多次向县、区控告仲跻宽的罪行。如果县、区干部能虚心听取人民意见，这一案件早就可以弄清的。但凫山县和该县六区的领导干部却对人民意见置若罔闻，听任反动分子破坏我们的革命事业，以致造成党与人民事业的严重损失。他们这种官僚主义作风，已经达到了不能容忍的地步。我们认为：凫山县应该继续大力加强处理人民来信的工作，并给此案中严重失职的干部以必要的处分。
    山东省凫山县党政领导机关在去年十月组织全体干部结合“张顺有事件”和“韩升事件”，学习了中央人民政府政务院和山东省人民政府关于加强处理人民来信和接见人民工作的指示，开始转变了忽视人民来信的官僚主义作风。在去年十二月根据人民群众的检举材料，逮捕了篡夺乡政权三年并混入了共产党组织的反革命分子仲跻宽。
    仲跻宽是凫山县六区早林乡的地主，今年四十岁。二十岁时即开始和当地反动势力及土匪勾结起来，欺压群众，并参加了反动的“安清帮”。一九四四年，仲跻宽钻入我国营鲁桥商店工作，同年混入了共产党。一九四七年蒋匪发动大规模内战时，他就公开勾结敌人，向我军进攻。他自己担任伪警察大队第四中队长，威胁引诱当时的村干部刘书河、张桂林和战士史中安、刘文善等参加了伪警察队充当队员，并把我军存放在早林村的大枪十六枝起出，武装了他领导的伪警察队，向农民们算回一九四六年被算去的三十六亩地。接着他又到七区古沟村进行反革命活动，以后又将武装交给伪县政府。一九四九年凫山解放后，他回到家乡，在村里拉拢干部，伪装进步，经常帮助村政府办公，以掩盖其罪恶，重新混入了共产党组织。一九五○年土地改革时，他又乘机当了乡长，主持土地改革。接着就大肆进行阴谋活动，拉拢落后分子，结成宗派，打击积极分子，有计划地破坏党和人民政府的政策，疏远党与群众的联系。他对坚持正义、积极工作的干部实行打击，给向他斗争过的人加上“特务嫌疑”的罪名，使这些人在群众中孤立，不能发挥工作积极性。这样，他就把早林乡政府变成了维护地主阶级和反革命分子的堡垒。如蒋匪特务仲兆节曾在一九四六年十月间带领匪湖警大队抢劫我民兵步枪十枝和公粮两万多斤，在镇压反革命时，被群众检举出来，仲跻宽却借口“镇反已过，不要再提了，”将仲兆节放走。伪乡丁黄书亭在一九四七年曾仗敌人势力强奸妇女及幼女多人，经常打骂群众，群众恨之入骨，要求人民政府逮捕法办，但仲跻宽则说黄“不够条件”，在去年十一月又将黄放跑。这些反革命分子至今仍逍遥法外。仲跻宽还经常打骂群众，随意放枪威吓群众。早林乡的群众从爱护党与人民政府出发，曾收集仲跻宽的反动行为的材料，派代表到区、县控告。从一九五○年到一九五二年的三年中，曾到区控告四次，到县控告三次，另外到区口头控诉十次以上；但是县、区干部对群众的控诉始终没有重视，一直拖延未作调查。区领导干部张西尧竟极端错误地说：“乡干部要少批评，谁把乡、村干部批评垮了谁就要负责任。”早林村的复员军人唐洪海把仲跻宽的反动活动材料反映到区，反遭到区干部的批评。区干部说：“仲跻宽虽有毛病，但唐洪海也不是好的，仲跻宽虽然有毛病，工作还能干，哪个干部没毛病呢？”在区干部的包庇下，反动分子仲跻宽的气焰日益嚣张。群众对政府极为不满，生产情绪逐渐低落。有的群众说：算了吧！胳膊还能拧过大腿去？再告，恐怕要给咱们自己找上麻烦啦！直到去年十一月上旬县领导机关根据群众检举材料，派出检查组到乡里检查对证材料时，仲跻宽仍在继续活动。他气势汹汹地在大街上骂青年团乡支部书记黄秀岐（因黄曾向县检举他一次）的母亲说：“我是党员，我把枪交给敌人啦，你看着怎么办吧！”又召集乡政委员和党支部开会（不叫检举过他的党员、干部参加），布置亲信，企图打击检举过他的干部和群众。到去年十一月，凫山县领导机关在上级指示下，检查并加强了处理人民来信的工作，清理了过去积压的人民来信，并将群众检举仲跻宽的问题作为重点，派该县人民监察委员会副主任郎秀华等组织检查组，到早林乡深入检查，才查清仲跻宽反动活动的全部事实，于去年十二月呈请上级批准，将仲跻宽逮捕法办。仲跻宽被逮捕后，早林乡群众个个称快。      　（盛太真）
