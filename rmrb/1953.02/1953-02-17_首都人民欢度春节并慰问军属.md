    首都人民欢度春节并慰问军属
    首都人民在日夜不绝的爆竹声中，愉快地过着春节。各机关、工厂、学校都放假四天。人们不断地向街头、公园、以及各种娱乐场所涌来；许多电影院、剧院的门前都挂着“客满”的牌子。城里有四十多个群众文艺剧团在分区演出。劳动人民文化宫举行“春节游园联欢大会”，有滦州影戏、曲艺、杂技、武术、洋片、电影等多种节目演出。在悠扬的音乐声中，战士、工人、学生手携手地跳着集体舞。郊区的农民们也在欢欢喜喜地庆祝春节，他们演出的节目有莲花落、踩高蹻、中幡、少林棍、花铂、献音等。北京市国营贸易公司、合作社和私营商业充分供应市民物资。在欢乐的春节中，人们把慰问信和慰问品不断地向朝鲜前线送去。同时，各界人民和许多机关的干部还组织了慰问队，敲着锣，打着鼓，去给军属拜年，送年礼，送光荣匾或光荣灯；又请军属看电影和参加联欢会。每一家军属在春节中都分外感到政府和人民对他们的爱护和尊敬。（据新华社讯）
