Thoroughly Overcome Subjectivist Errors in Economic Science
Soviet Union A. Sobolev

Editor's Note: Comrade Stalin, in his brilliant work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR," pointed out the serious errors of some Soviet economists and philosophers who viewed the laws of social development from a subjectivist standpoint, and emphasized the objective nature of these laws. On January 24th, this newspaper published Comrade Suslov's article "On Fedoseev's Two Articles," which pointed out the subjective idealist erroneous views of Fedoseev, the former editor-in-chief of the Soviet journal "Bolshevik," regarding the laws of social development. Now, Comrade Sobolev's article points out similar errors made by several prominent Soviet economists and highlights what political, economic, and scientific consequences such erroneous views can lead to. This will be helpful for the study of our country's economists and senior cadres.

The publication of Comrade Stalin's brilliant work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR" and the resolutions of the 19th Party Congress have greatly strengthened the desire of the broad masses of working people to master the fundamental principles of Marxist-Leninist theory.

The major task facing our ideological cadres is to extensively promote Marxist-Leninist theory and completely overcome various erroneous viewpoints that hinder the correct mastery of Marxism-Leninism.

Marxism-Leninism is a powerful weapon for understanding the objective world and transforming it revolutionarily. The doctrines of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin are all-powerful because they faithfully and correctly reflect the objective laws of social development, enabling us to grasp these laws and apply them to practice.

Comrade Stalin, in his work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR," comprehensively studied the laws of development of the socialist mode of production, emphasized the objective nature of these laws, and thus inflicted a devastating blow on subjectivist and idealist arguments in economic science.

Marxism teaches that the laws of political economy—whether in the capitalist or socialist periods—are reflections of objective processes that do not depend on people's will. Comrade Stalin instructed: "People can discover these laws, understand them, rely on them, and use them to benefit society, divert the destructive action of certain laws in another direction, limit their scope of action, and give other laws striving to clear a path for themselves a broad space for action. But people cannot abolish these laws or create new economic laws." ("Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR," Chinese version, page 3)

The Party leaders Lenin and Stalin consistently waged a resolute struggle against subjectivists in theory and adventurists of all kinds in politics. They pointed out that the practical activities of the proletarian party should proceed from the mature needs of the material development of society and should be guided by the recognized economic laws.

Lenin wrote: "No reform can be 'introduced,' and no one thinks of 'introducing' it, and it should not be introduced, by the commune, i.e., the Soviet of Workers' and Peasants' Deputies, unless it has become absolutely ripe economically and in the consciousness of the majority of the people." (Lenin's Collected Works, Volume 24, Russian edition, page 48)

Comrade Stalin, developing the Marxist principle on the determining role of production in social life and summarizing the practice of socialist construction in the Soviet Union, pointed out in "Dialectical and Historical Materialism":

"…In order to avoid mistakes in policy, the proletarian party must both in drafting its programme and in its practical activities proceed primarily from the laws of development of production, from the laws of economic development of society." ("Problems of Leninism," 11th edition, Russian version, page 591)

These theses of Lenin and Stalin opened up a scientific basis for the policies of the Communist Party and the Soviet state, a direction that is opposed to the subjective interpretation of economic laws.

However, some unscientific, subjective idealist views are prevalent in our literature, according to which the Soviet state seems to be able to "create," "transform," and "abolish" socialist economic laws at will. Subjectivists declare that the basic economic law of socialism can be said to be the dictatorship of the proletariat, or it can be the national economic plan. This subjective distortion of Marxist theory is fully reflected in Voznesensky's anti-Marxist book "The Soviet War Economy During the Patriotic War."

As is well known, Comrade A. Leontiev is one of the propagators of Voznesensky's anti-Marxist book and the subjective arguments in socialist political economy in our economic literature. In his pamphlets and articles, Leontiev confuses the economic role of the state with the objective laws of social development, and declares that the activities of the Soviet organs in planning the national economy are the economic laws of socialism. For example, he incorrectly interprets the views of our great teachers on the nature of socialist economic laws. In his book "Socialist Political Economy in the Works of Lenin and Stalin," he writes: "The planning of the national economy is the economic law of the socialist mode of production." (page 30 of the book) In another work, "The Nature of the Socialist National Economic System and Its Economic Laws," Leontiev asserts that socialist planning is "the most important law of Soviet economic development." Thus, the basic economic law of socialism is replaced by the "law" of planning the national economy, and the theory of political economy is replaced by economic policy.

This similar subjective view on the issue of economic laws under the socialist system is also promoted in the writings of another economist, Comrade I. Glatkov. His book "An Outline of the Construction of the Soviet Planned Economy in 1917-1918" is actually based on the theory of non-Marxist arguments, in which the system of proletarian dictatorship and the plans it formulates are portrayed as if they are the law of all laws. Glatkov attempts to add a subjectivist interpretation to the classic works of Marxism-Leninism. He writes:

"In the writings of the founders of Marxism-Leninism, the planned management of the economy is presented as a characteristic of the economic laws of the socialist system." (page 5 of the book) Glatkov believes that the main force of Soviet social development is not production, which is constrained by the operation of objective economic laws, but the Soviet state. The author asserts that "from the very beginning of its activities, the Soviet state was the source of economic movement and development." ("Economic Questions" No. 5, 1948, pages 18-19)

Comrade Kozlov also actively promoted this subjectivist view in some of his articles. In an article published in the first issue of "Economic Questions" in 1948, he wrote: "The source of movement and development in the socialist economy is the socialist state that formulates plans." (page 13) In other works, the author pointed out that the state plan is the law of development of the Soviet national economy. (For example, "Economic Questions" No. 6, 1948, page 15).

What is wrong with this argument?

The error of this argument lies in its disregard for the Marxist principle of the determining role of the economy in social development, the principle of the regularity of this development, and elevating the actions of the state, its will, and the desires of the people to the position of the primary, decisive economic law.

Comrade Stalin, in his classic work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR," pointed out that denying the objective nature of economic laws, declaring that the Soviet state is divorced from economic necessity, divorced from objective laws, and
"free," would "plunge us into the realm of chaos and chance, make us slaves to these chances, make it impossible for us not only to understand things, but even to do the most elementary things in our economic leadership because of this chaotic confusion." (Chinese version, pages 77-78)

Secondly, if planning is the economic law of socialism, and various plans are formulated by people, by the state, then it would be concluded that under the socialist system, people and the state can create economic laws at will, and can arbitrarily determine the development of society.

In fact, the possibility of planning the national economy and its enormous power stems from the fact that it is determined by the objective economic laws of socialism, and that it is necessary and depends on a certain economic foundation. Comrade Stalin taught that national economic planning can only achieve good results when it correctly reflects the requirements of the law of planned development of the national economy, and when it is in all respects suited to the requirements of the basic economic law of socialism.

Denying the objective regularity of economic development under the socialist system, asserting that economic laws can be created and eliminated by the state under socialist conditions, and that the will of the people can determine the development of society—all of this opens up avenues for adventurism and arbitrariness in politics.

Thirdly, the subjectivists deny the objectivity of social development under the socialist system, deny the objectivity of economic laws, and in essence replace necessity with chance, and eliminate the science of political economy, because if the will of the state determines everything, if people can create economic laws at will, then science has no place.

If we were to stand on the position of the subjectivists, we would "abolish the science of political economy, because without recognizing objective regularity and without studying these regularities, science cannot exist and develop. If we abolish science, we will have no way to foresee the course of events in the domestic economic life, that is, we will have no way to do even the most basic economic leadership work well." ("Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR," Chinese version, pages 77-78)

Comrade Stalin developed the principles of Marx, Engels, and Lenin on the objective nature of economic laws, while teaching that these laws should not be idolized, that society is not powerless in the face of laws, and that after recognizing economic laws, society can master them, utilize them, and learn to apply them for the benefit of society.

The vitality and powerful transformative force of the policies of the Communist Party and the socialist state do not lie, as the subjectivists assert, in the fact that this policy is the source of Soviet economic development. The relations of production that are fully in line with the nature of the productive forces are the main and decisive force ensuring the strong development of the productive forces. The state, proceeding from the needs of the material development of Soviet society, guided by recognized economic laws, can exert a great influence on the economy and benefit society and all the people. The policies of the Party and the state are scientifically based, and they themselves reflect economic necessity. Relying on recognized objective laws, the Soviet state exerts a positive influence on the economic foundation, and its policies have great organizational and transformative significance.

Comrade Stalin instructed that the Soviet regime solved the difficult task of building socialism not because it eliminated the existing economic laws and "formulated" new economic laws, but only because it relied on the economic law that the relations of production must conform to the nature of the productive forces.

After recognizing the needs of economic development, the Party crushed the adventurists of Trotsky and the capitulationists of the right, purged these agents of the domestic and international bourgeoisie, built socialism, and is now successfully leading the construction of communist society.

The Party of Lenin and Stalin proceeds from the requirements of the basic economic law of socialism and carries out its creative activities for the construction of a communist society. The characteristics and aspects of this law are to ensure the maximum satisfaction of the constantly growing material and cultural needs of the entire society by continuously increasing and improving socialist production on a highly technical basis.

The erroneous views of some economists and philosophers, namely the denial of the objective nature of socialist economic laws and the promotion of subjectivist views, have damaged the cause of Marxist-Leninist education of our cadres. These views, which are incompatible with Marxism-Leninism, should be completely and thoroughly overcome.

    彻底克服经济科学中的主观主义的错误
    苏联  阿·梭勃列夫
    编者按：斯大林同志在他的天才著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”一书中，指出那些站在主观主义的立场来看社会发展法则的一部分苏联经济学家和哲学家的严重错误，并着重说明了这些法则的客观性质。本报一月二十四日曾发表了苏斯洛夫同志所作“关于费道谢也夫的两篇文章”一文，指出苏联前“布尔什维克”杂志总编辑费道谢也夫对于社会发展法则的主观主义的唯心主义的错误观点。现在梭勃列夫同志的这篇文章又指出了苏联几位著名经济学家的类似的错误，并着重指明了这种错误观点在政治上、经济上和科学上会导致一些什么恶果。这对于我国的经济学者及高级干部的学习，都是有帮助的。
    斯大林同志的天才著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”的出版和党的第十九次代表大会的决议，大大地加强了广大劳动群众掌握马克思—列宁主义理论基础的愿望。
    我们的思想干部所面对的重大任务是广泛展开马克思列宁主义理论的宣传，完全克服有碍正确掌握马克思列宁主义的各种错误观点。
    马克思列宁主义是认识客观世界和用革命方法改造客观世界的有力武器。马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的学说无所不能，因为它忠实地、正确地反映了社会发展的客观法则，使我们有可能把这些法则掌握起来并应用到实践中去。
    斯大林同志在其著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”中，全面研究了社会主义的生产方式的发展法则，着重指出了这些法则的客观性质，也就使经济科学中的主观主义的、唯心主义的论述遭受了毁灭性的打击。
    马克思主义教导说，政治经济学法则—无论在资本主义时期或社会主义时期都一样—是不以人们的意志为转移的客观过程的反映。斯大林同志指示说：“人们能发现这些法则，认识它们，依靠它们，利用它们来为社会谋福利，把某些法则所发生的破坏作用引导到另一方向，限制它们发生作用的范围，给予其他正在争取为自己开辟道路的法则以发生作用的广阔场所。但是人们不能消灭这些法则或创造新的经济法则。”（“苏联社会主义经济问题”中文版第三页）
    党的领袖列宁和斯大林对于理论方面的主观主义者和政治方面的各种冒险主义者，一向进行着坚决的斗争。他们指出，无产阶级政党的实际活动应当从社会的物质发展方面成熟的需要出发，应当以所认识的经济法则为指南。
    列宁写道：“任何一种改革，如果在经济实况中，在大多数人民意识中都没有绝对成熟，那末，公社，即工农代表苏维埃，是决不‘施行’，决不打算‘施行’，而且也决不应该施行的。”（列宁全集第二十四卷，俄文版，第四十八页）
    发展了马克思主义者关于在社会生活中生产的决定作用的原理，总结了苏联社会主义建设的实践的斯大林同志，在“辩证唯物主义与历史唯物主义”中指出：
    “……为了在政治上不犯错误，无产阶级党在制定自己的党纲以及进行实际活动时，首先应以生产发展的规律，应以社会经济发展的规律为出发点。”（“列宁主义问题”第十一版，俄文版，第五九一页）
    列宁和斯大林的这些论述给共产党和苏维埃国家的政策开辟了科学的基础，那方针是反对主观主义的对于经济法则的解说的。
    然而在我们的文献中却流行着一些非科学的、主观的唯心论的观点，根据这些观点，苏维埃国家仿佛是可以自行“创造”，“改造”和“废除”社会主义的经济法则似的。主观主义者宣布道，社会主义的基本经济法则，可以说是无产阶级专政，也可以是国民经济计划。这种主观主义的对马克思主义理论的曲解充分反映在沃斯涅克斯基所著反马克思主义的“卫国战争期内的苏联战时经济”一书中。
    众所周知，在我们的经济文献中，阿·列昂节夫同志是沃斯涅克斯基的那本反马克思主义的书和社会主义政治经济学中主观的论述的宣传者之一。列昂节夫在他所著的小册子和论文中，把国家的经济作用和社会发展的客观规律混为一谈，宣布苏维埃机关在国民经济计划化方面的活动便是社会主义的经济法则。例如，他不正确地阐述了我们的伟大导师关于社会主义经济法则的性质的问题的观点，在他所著：“列宁和斯大林著作中的社会主义政治经济学”一书中，他写道：“国民经济计划化是社会主义的生产方式的经济法则。”（该书第三○页）在另外一篇著作“社会主义的国民经济制度及其经济法则的性质”中，列昂节夫断言说，社会主义的计划化是“苏联经济发展的最重要法则”。这样，社会主义的基本经济法则被国民经济计划化的“法则”所代替，而政治经济学理论则为经济政策所代替了。
    关于社会主义制度下经济法则问题的这种类似的主观主义的观点，在另一位经济学家—伊·格拉特科夫同志的著作中，也被宣传着。他所著的“一九一七年——一九一八年苏联计划经济建设概论”一书，实际上就是以非马克思主义的论述的理论为基础，其中把无产阶级专政制度及其所制订的计划说得好像是一切法则的法则。格拉特科夫企图给马克思列宁主义的经典作家加上主观主义的解释。他写道：
    “在马克思列宁主义奠基者的著作中，有计划地管理经济这一点是作为社会主义制度的经济法则的特征提出的。”（该书第五页）格拉特科夫认为，苏维埃社会发展的主要力量，不是为客观经济法则的作用所制约的生产，而是苏维埃国家。作者断言说，“苏维埃国家从其活动的最初起，就是经济的运动和发展的根源。”（一九四八年“经济问题”第五期第十八——十九页）
    科兹洛夫同志在他的一些论文中也积极地宣传了这种主观主义的观点。在一九四八年“经济问题”第一期所刊载的一篇文章中，他写道：“社会主义经济的运动和发展的根源，是订立计划的社会主义国家。”（第十三页）在其他的一些著作里，作者指出，国家计划是苏联国民经济的发展法则。（例如，一九四八年“经济问题”第六期第十五页）。
    这种论断的错误在什么地方呢？
    这种论断的错误，是在于它们无视了马克思主义者关于经济在社会发展中的决定作用、关于这一发展的规律性的原理，而把国家的行动，它的意志和人们的愿望提升到主要的、决定一切的经济法则的地位。
    斯大林同志在他的经典著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”中指出，否认经济法则的客观性质，宣布苏维埃国家是脱离经济的必然性，脱离客观法则而
    “自由的”，这就“会使我们陷身在混乱和偶然性的王国，使我们处在奴隶似地依赖于这些偶然性的地位，使我们不仅失去了解事情的可能性，而且简直会在这偶然性的混乱中瞎摸”。（中文版第七八页）
    其次，如果计划化是社会主义的经济法则，而各种计划都是由人、由国家编制的，那么就会得出结论说，在社会主义制度下，人和国家可以自行创造经济法则，可以随意确定社会的发展。
    实际上，国民经济计划化之所以有可能性，它之所以具有巨大的力量，因为它是由社会主义的客观经济法则所规定的，它是必需的和依靠于一定的经济基础的。斯大林同志教导说，国民经济的计划化，只有在它正确地反映国民经济有计划发展的法则的要求时，和它在各方面适合社会主义基本经济法则的要求时，才能得到良好的结果。
    否认社会主义制度下经济发展的客观规律性，断言在社会主义条件下经济法则可以由国家创造和消灭，人的意志可以决定社会的发展，——这一切都给政治中的冒险主义和专横作风开辟了活动场所。
    再次，主观主义者们否认社会主义制度下社会发展的客观性，否认经济法则的客观性，实质上就是用偶然性来代替必然性，取消政治经济学这门科学，因为，如果国家的意志决定一切，如果人们可以随意创造经济法则，那么科学就没有地位了。
    如果我们站在主观主义者的立场，会使“我们取消政治经济学这门科学，因为不承认客观的规律性，不研究这些规律性，科学是不能存在和发展的。取消了科学，我们就没有可能预见国内经济生活中事变的进程，即没有可能把那怕是最起码的经济领导工作做好。”（“苏联社会主义经济问题”中文版第七八页）
    斯大林同志发展了马克思、恩格斯、列宁关于经济法则的客观性质的原理，同时教导说，不应该把这些法则偶像化，社会在法则面前并不是无能为力的，同时在认识了经济法则之后，社会可以掌握它们、利用它们、学会应用它们为社会谋福利。
    共产党和社会主义国家的政策的生活力和强大的改造力量，并不是如主观主义者所断言，在于这个政策是苏联经济发展的根源。社会主义的完全适合于生产力性质的生产关系，是保证生产力强力发展的主要的和决定性的力量。国家由苏维埃社会物质发展的需要出发，以认识了的经济法则为指南，可以在经济上发挥巨大的影响，为社会和全体人民谋福利。党和国家的政策，是有科学根据的，它本身反映出经济的必然性。依靠着认识了的客观法则，苏维埃国家在经济基础上表现出积极的影响，它的政策具有巨大的组织的和改造的意义。
    斯大林同志指示说，苏维埃政权解决了建设社会主义这一个困难任务，并不是因为它消灭了现存的经济法则，“制定”了新的经济法则，而仅仅是因为它依靠了生产关系一定要适合生产力性质这个经济法则。
    认识了经济发展的需要之后，党粉碎了托洛茨基的冒险主义分子和右倾投降主义分子，把这些国内和国际资产阶级的代理人清除出去，建成了社会主义，现在并成功地领导着共产主义社会的建设。
    列宁、斯大林的党是由社会主义基本经济法则的要求出发，为建设共产主义社会，而进行自己创造性的活动的。这个法则的特点和方面，就是用在高度技术基础上使社会主义生产不断增长和不断完善的办法，来保证最大限度地满足整个社会经常增长的物质和文化的需要。
    一些经济学家和哲学家的错误观点，即否认社会主义经济法则的客观性质和宣传主观主义的观点，使我们干部的马克思列宁主义教育事业遭受了损害，应该完全而彻底地克服这些与马克思列宁主义全不相容的观点。
