    Many Machine Factories in East China Experience Raw Material Supply Interruptions and Partial Shutdowns
    The Main Reason is the Disconnection Between the Production Plans of Each Factory and the Production Plans of National Steel Plants
    [Our Newspaper] Many state-owned and jointly state-private machine factories in East China have experienced interruptions in the supply of raw materials, affecting the timely completion of production plans, and some machine factories have shut down partially awaiting materials.
    This year, the production tasks of state-owned and jointly state-private machine factories in East China have increased compared to last year. The planned total output value of general factories has increased by more than 70% compared to the actual total output value of last year, with the highest increase reaching five and a half times. Many factories also have the task of trial-producing new products for basic construction. However, the supply of raw materials to many factories has been interrupted, and the factories have had to put unfinished products aside. This not only affects capital turnover but will also delay the delivery dates of many urgent orders. Pujiang Machine Factory has already sent a telegram to the ordering unit requesting an extension of the delivery date; part of the Wusong Machine Factory has already stopped production awaiting materials; and many factories have been forced to disrupt production plans and use inventory raw materials for other production to avoid shutdowns.
    The main reason for the interruption in the supply of raw materials is that the production plans of the state-owned and jointly state-private machine factories in East China are not connected with the production plans of the national steel plants. Each machine factory prepared its first-quarter material allocation plan last October and it was approved by the Central First Ministry of Machine Industry. The Central First Ministry of Machine Industry also ordered each factory to directly order these materials from state-owned steel plants in various regions. However, the steel plants did not have ready-made products and generally would not be able to deliver until March or April. Furthermore, many steel materials used by the factories have not yet been ordered. Therefore, up to now, not a single kilogram of raw materials used by the machine factories in the first quarter has arrived at the factories. Secondly, the disconnection in the organizational adjustment of the East China Mechanical Industry Administrative System has also increased the difficulty of supplying raw materials. After the abolition of the East China Industrial Department, the former East China Industrial Department Management Office, which was previously responsible for supplying raw materials to the factories, was ordered to become the East China Supply and Marketing Branch of the Central First Ministry of Machine Industry. The branch is only responsible for entrusting private hardware and machinery industries with processing orders and is no longer responsible for supplying raw materials to the factories. However, no other agency is responsible for supplying raw materials to the factories. Currently, the interruption of raw material supply is a serious problem, and the Central First Ministry of Machine Industry should immediately find a solution; otherwise, the first quarter's production tasks may fail.

    华东许多机器厂原材料供应中断局部停工
    主要原因是各厂生产计划与全国钢铁厂的生产计划不衔接
    【本报讯】华东区许多国营、公私合营机器厂的原材料供应已经中断，影响了生产计划不能及时完成，部分机器厂已停工待料。
    今年华东区各国营、公私合营机器厂的生产任务比去年加重了，一般厂的计划生产总值都比去年实际生产总值增加了百分之七十以上，最多的增加到五倍半；许多厂还有试制基本建设的新产品的任务。但目前许多厂的原材料供应已经中断，各厂只好把未完工的产品搁置起来。这样不仅影响了资金周转，而且势将延误许多紧急订货的交货日期。浦江机器厂已打电报给订货单位请求延期交货；吴淞机器厂已有部分机器停工待料；许多厂为了避免停工而被迫打乱生产计划，以库存原材料进行其他生产。
    造成原材料供应中断的主要原因，是华东区各国营、公私合营机器厂的生产计划与全国各钢铁厂的生产计划没有衔接。各机器厂在去年十月就编好今年第一季度材料预拨计划，并经中央第一机械工业部批准；中央第一机械工业部并令各厂直接向各地国营钢铁厂订购这些材料。但各钢铁厂都没有现成产品，一般都到三、四月份才能交货。而各厂所用的许多钢铁材料，目前还没处订购。因此，直到现在，各机器厂第一季度所用的原材料还没有一公斤到达厂里。其次，华东机械工业行政管理系统的机构调整脱了节，也增加了原材料供应的困难。华东工业部撤销后，过去一向负责供应各厂原材料的前华东工业部经理处奉命改为中央第一机械工业部华东供销分局。该局仅负责向私营五金机器业委托加工订货，不再负责供应各厂原材料。但却没有其他机构来负责供应各厂的原材料。目前，原材料供应的中断是一个严重问题，中央第一机械工业部应即设法解决，否则，第一季度的生产任务就有可能落空。
