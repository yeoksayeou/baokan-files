    A Communist Party member (anonymous letter) from the East China Administrative Council Health Bureau wrote to Tan Zhenlin, Vice Chairman of the East China Administrative Council, reflecting the chaotic situation in the Health Bureau. Many people in the bureau are idle and have nothing to do: some play the huqin and chat during work hours; some close the door to play poker and chess. The political atmosphere in the Health Bureau is very thin.

    The reason for this phenomenon is mainly due to the bureaucratic work style of the leading cadres. Cui Yitian, the director of the bureau, is very complacent and rarely pays attention to political leadership. In every political movement, he rarely takes the lead. During the "Three-Anti" movement, his first self-criticism was written by his secretary. Although he made a self-criticism, his work style has not changed much. He often adopts an attitude of reporting only good news and not bad news, and saying yes to his superiors; he does not go deep into the grassroots or understand the situation below. He only wants to hear good words and does not want to hear "bad words." He regards some people who often offer him opinions as thorns in his side, hoping to transfer them away; he draws in some cadres who echo his views and even do nothing all day long. During this cadre transfer, he transferred away those he considered not good. He ignores many reasonable suggestions made by everyone during the "Three-Anti" movement. He says he wants the lower levels to offer opinions, but the opinions others offer are like "a stone sinking into the sea." In addition, Cui Yitian also has serious departmentalism. For example, a few months ago, the Central Personnel Department sent a letter to transfer a comrade who originally studied chemistry to work in another department, but he still hasn't let him go. This comrade comes to the office every day, just to warm himself by the fire and drink tea, with nothing to do. Cui Yitian once said to people: "The Central Committee wants to transfer cadres, but I am in East China, so I won't give them."

    Political and current affairs study among the cadres of the East China Health Bureau is not being done well. Leading cadres cannot set an example and take the lead in studying, so they are far from meeting everyone's requirements. For example, when studying Malenkov's report at the 19th Congress of the Soviet Communist Party, everyone asked the responsible comrades to make a mobilization report, but this was not allowed. There is also a lack of democratic life within the Party. When discussing issues at branch meetings, the opinions of ordinary Party members are often suppressed. Under the above circumstances, communication between superiors and subordinates is poor, people are alienated, uprightness cannot be promoted, and many people keep their opinions to themselves, not daring to raise them to their superiors, fearing retaliation and blows.

### 华东行政委员会卫生局混乱现象严重

    华东行政委员会卫生局混乱现象严重
    华东行政委员会卫生局一个共产党员写信（匿名信）给华东行政委员会谭震林副主席，反映卫生局的混乱情况。局内很多人闲着没事做：有的在工作时拉胡琴，扯乱谈；有的关起门来打扑克、下棋。卫生局里的政治空气非常稀薄。
    造成这种现象的原因，主要是由于领导干部有官僚主义作风。该局局长崔义田非常自满，很少注意政治领导。在每一个政治运动中，他很少起带头作用。“三反”运动中他的第一次检讨就是叫秘书写的。他虽则作了检讨，但工作作风并没有多大改变。他对上级往往采取报喜不报忧、唯唯诺诺的态度；对下级则不深入下层，不了解下情，只愿听好话，不愿听“坏话”。对一些常向他提意见的人则视为眼中钉，希望把他们调走；他拉拢一些随声附和的甚至饱食终日的干部。这次调动干部时，他把他认为不好的人都调走了。他对大家在“三反”运动中所提出的许多合理化建议，置之不问。他嘴里说要下面提意见，但别人提出的意见就如“石沉大海”。此外，崔义田还有严重的本位主义思想。例如，几个月以前，中央人事部来信调一位原来学化学的同志到其他部门工作，但至今还没有让他走。这位同志天天来到办公室里，只是烤烤火，喝喝茶，无事可做。崔义田曾对人说过：“中央要调干部，我在华东，就不给。”
    华东卫生局干部中的政治时事学习搞得很不好。领导干部不能以身作则、带头学习，因而远不能满足大家的要求。例如此次学习马林科夫在苏联共产党第十九次代表大会上的报告，大家要求负责同志做一个动员报告，都没有得到允许。党内也缺乏民主生活，支部大会讨论问题时，一般党员的意见往往遭到压制。在上述情况下，上下不通气，离心离德，正气不能发扬，许多人把意见闷在肚子里，不敢向上级提出来，怕报复打击。
