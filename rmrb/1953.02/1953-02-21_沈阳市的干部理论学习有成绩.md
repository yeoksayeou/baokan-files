Shenyang City's in-service cadre education, under the care and leadership of the CPC Shenyang Municipal Committee, has been improving year by year and has initially formed an education network.

Since Shenyang City resumed the academic year system in July last year on the basis of the "Three-Anti" movement, the number of participants has reached 30,114, including 32 advanced self-study groups composed of cadres at the municipal bureau level and above, totaling 264 people; 3 intermediate spare-time Party schools with 1,748 people; and 74 primary spare-time Party schools with 28,102 people. In addition, 41,253 people participated in the study of "Communism and the Communist Party," and these students will be able to enter primary spare-time Party schools by May of this year. The study atmosphere in various organs of the city is very intense. Municipal leaders insist on studying with great perseverance, grasping their own study on the one hand and actively leading general cadres to study on the other. All units influence each other and take pride in doing a good job in study.

In terms of study content, from July to early November last year, senior group and some intermediate group cadres participated in the Socialist Economic Construction Counselor Training Class held by the Northeast Bureau, studying Chapters 9 to 12 of the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union" and combining it with the study of "Lenin and Stalin on Socialist Economic Construction." Before November, intermediate spare-time Party schools studied "Social Development History," and primary spare-time Party schools generally studied "Political Common Sense." From November onwards, senior and intermediate groups successively switched to studying the documents of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union; in December, the primary group universally conveyed Comrade Malenkov's report through the senior group.

Through these studies, everyone felt that they had gained a lot. Some senior cadres reflected that this study combined the theory they had learned in the past with practical work. General cadres also believed that these studies were "both timely and practical." After studying, cadres at all levels generally understood the direction of China's industrialization, the importance of developing heavy industry, and deeply realized the importance of Chairman Mao's instruction that "the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is our best teacher, and we must learn from the Communist Party of the Soviet Union." As a result, they also strengthened their overall concept, realized that vying with the state for investment and cadres was narrow departmentalism, and realized that using state funds and manpower regardless of priority was tantamount to "dividing forces to guard every point" in military terms, which would weaken the strength of national construction and delay the speed of national industrialization. Cadres in economic departments have theoretically realized the great role of practicing economy, reducing costs, tapping industrial potential, strengthening economic accounting, strengthening capital turnover, and mastering price policies in developing industry. Some comrades said: In the past, in the matter of prices, they often cheated each other in order to compete for profits, making the product prices inaccurate. Now they know that whether the product prices are controlled correctly or not will directly affect the development of industry. Some cadres said: "After this study, the leading cadres of the municipal enterprises easily reached a consensus in determining the prices of products, and there was no longer any phenomenon of competing for profits or falsely reporting costs. In this way, the 1953 national economic plan could be completed very smoothly." For example, cadres in the commercial sector understood the great role of commerce in national industrialization, strengthening urban-rural ties, and consolidating the worker-peasant alliance, and corrected the incorrect understanding of commercial workers as "businessmen."

In addition, most senior and intermediate cadres have conducted self-study and discussion on Chairman Mao's "On Contradiction" and Stalin's "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR." As a result, when analyzing and studying work, they have learned to recognize the main contradictions and the main aspects of contradictions in their work, which has greatly enlightened them in understanding the central links of current work and improving cadres' thinking. When studying "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR," they connected it with the reality of China's economy and realized the importance of seriously studying the experience of Soviet economic construction. Because many comrades felt the great role of theory in guiding practice, their enthusiasm for learning became increasingly consolidated.

From this stage of study, we deeply realized that the leadership's attention and leading role in learning are the key to promoting the entire cadre study. Experience has proved that when leading cadres learn, it is the most powerful mobilization and call, and at the same time, it solves the problem of theoretical guidance for middle and primary-level cadres' learning. Members of the Shenyang Municipal Committee and the mayor all regard leading learning as part of their work. Li Qian, deputy director of the Industrial Department of the Municipal Committee, personally took charge when leading the study of the second part of Malenkov's report, insisted on studying by setting an example, and made a concluding speech at the end of the study, thus driving the study of all cadres. However, there are still some leading comrades who are only satisfied with organizing, and their work is still stuck in the general organization and call stage, and they do not have a sufficient understanding of the importance of realizing ideological leadership, improving cadres, and promoting work through learning. This must be corrected.

Regarding the most effective way to organize middle and primary-level cadres to conduct political and theoretical study, it is to appropriately use spare time to establish spare-time Party schools so that cadres who cannot study independently or cannot fully study Marxism-Leninism can conduct systematic learning in an orderly manner. According to Shenyang's experience, this organizational form is very popular among cadres. For example, some cadres said: "In this way, everyone can study theory well step by step and under the guidance of a certain organization."

In addition, the "Theoretical Study Room" established by the Municipal Committee is also a very good experience. Because of the theoretical study room, some people began to study specialized courses, which played a significant role in helping senior cadres to study independently and guiding middle and primary-level cadres to study, in running teacher and counselor training classes, in unifying teaching plans, supplying cadres with learning materials and teachers' teaching outlines, and answering difficult questions.

In order to consolidate the results of cadre study, it is very important to implement the learning method of combining theory with practice. In August last year, senior and intermediate group cadres in Shenyang City participated in the study of "Lenin and Stalin on Socialist Economic Construction." At that time, it was the eve of the large-scale economic construction of our country, and the vast number of cadres urgently felt the need to arm themselves with economic knowledge. After this study, many leading cadres basically broke away from the state of coping with work only by experience or piecemeal knowledge, and their learning enthusiasm also increased day by day.

At present, the problems existing in Shenyang City's cadre education work are, first of all, the group organization is not strict and the levels vary greatly, which affects the learning effect. According to experience, those with an education level of less than junior high school should focus on learning culture, supplemented by political common sense courses; those with a higher education level and some political theory foundation can be promoted to primary spare-time Party schools. Therefore, the Municipal Committee decided that from this year onwards, each unit should set up a cadre culture learning department under the spare-time Party school; at the same time, it plans to expand the intermediate spare-time Party school, so that the number will increase from more than 1,700 last year to 8,000. In this way, comrades with low cultural levels can be spared the suffering of "great effort and small gain"; some cadres with a university education level will not feel unsatisfied with studying "political common sense."

Secondly, about one-quarter to one-third of the city's more than 400 teachers in spare-time Party schools cannot meet the requirements of the students in their lectures. In the future, it is planned to improve the teaching level of part-time teachers by running teacher training classes and strengthening the "Theoretical Study Room." At the same time, the system of organizing several people to teach the same content and giving lectures on a rotational basis will be implemented, so that teachers can be familiar with their work and reduce preparation time. In order to ensure the progress of the courses in the spare-time Party school, the Municipal Committee decided that each spare-time Party school should be equipped with one or two full-time teachers in addition to part-time teachers. At the same time, it is also planned to organize a full-time lecturer group of about 20 people, mainly responsible for the courses of primary spare-time Party schools, in order to gradually reduce the courses of part-time teachers.

Thirdly, since the theoretical study of senior intellectuals (university professors, lecturers, chief engineers, engineers) has not been well resolved, it is planned to establish two to three spare-time universities under the unified leadership of the Propaganda Department of the Municipal Committee, starting in February 1953. Responsible comrades of the Northeast Bureau and the Municipal Committee will be invited to teach the courses. (Propaganda Department of the CPC Shenyang Municipal Committee)

    沈阳市的干部理论学习有成绩
    沈阳市在职干部教育，在中共沈阳市委的关怀和领导下，逐年有所改进。并已初步组成一个教育网。
    沈阳市自去年七月在“三反”运动的基础上恢复了学年制，参加学习的人数有三万零一百一十四人，其中包括市级处长以上干部组成的高级自学小组三十二个，共二百六十四人；中级业余党校三所，计一千七百四十八人；初级业余党校七十四所，二万八千一百零二人。此外，还有四万一千二百五十三人参加了“共产主义与共产党”的学习，这些学员到今年五月均可升入初级业余党校。该市各机关的学习空气都很紧张，市级领导同志都以高度的毅力坚持学习，一方面抓紧自己的学习，一方面积极带领一般干部学习，各单位互相影响，都以搞好学习为荣。
    在学习内容方面，去年七月到十一月初，高级组及中级组一部分干部曾参加了东北局举办的社会主义经济建设辅导员训练班，学习“联共党史”第九至十二章，并结合学习“列宁斯大林论社会主义经济建设”。中级业余党校在十一月以前，学习“社会发展史”，初级业余党校，一般都学“政治常识”。从十一月份起，高级与中级均先后转入联共第十九次代表大会文件的学习；初级组在十二月份则由高级组普遍传达马林科夫同志报告。
    经过这些学习，大家都感到收获很大。一些高级干部反映：这种学习使自己过去学得的理论与实际工作结合起来了。一般干部也认为这些学习“既适时，又实际”。经过学习，各级干部一般都懂得了中国工业化的方向，发展重工业的重要意义，深刻地体会到毛主席指示“联共就是我们的最好的先生，我们必须向联共学习”的重要；因而也加强了整体观念，认识到向国家争投资、争干部是狭隘的本位主义，认识到不分轻重地使用国家的资金和人力，是等于军事上的“分兵把口”，会削弱国家建设的力量，延缓国家工业化的速度。经济部门的干部更从理论上认识到厉行节约、降低成本、发挥工业潜力、加强经济核算，加强资金周转及掌握价格政策对发展工业的重大作用。有的同志说：过去在价格问题上往往为了互争利润而互相欺骗，使产品价格规定得不准确，现在知道了产品价格掌握的正确与否会直接影响到工业的发展。有的干部说：“从这次学习以后，市属企业在确定产品价格上，各单位领导干部的思想很容易的就取得一致了，不再有互争利润或虚报成本的现象。这样编制一九五三年国民经济计划时，就能很顺利地完成了”。又如商业部门干部懂得了商业对国家工业化、加强城乡联系、巩固工农联盟的重大作用，便纠正了过去把商业工作者认为是“买卖人”等不正确认识。
    此外，高级中级大多数干部对毛主席的“矛盾论”、斯大林的“苏联社会主义经济问题”都进行了自学和讨论，因而在分析研究工作时，都学会认识工作中的主要矛盾和矛盾的主要方面，这对了解当前工作中心环节和提高干部思想都有很大的启发。大家在学习“苏联社会主义经济问题”时，联系到中国经济的实际，更加认识到了认真研究苏联经济建设经验的重要性。由于许多同志感到理论对指导实际的重大作用，使自己的学习热情日趋巩固。
    从这一阶段学习中，我们深切体会到领导重视与带头学习，是推动整个干部学习的关键。经验证明：领导干部学习起来，就是最有力的动员号召，同时也就解决了中、初级干部学习的理论指导问题。沈阳市委委员及市长都把领导学习作为自己工作的一部分。市委工业部副部长李潜同志在领导学习马林科夫报告第二部分时，曾亲自掌握，以身作则地坚持学习，并在学习结束时作总结发言，因而带动了全体干部的学习。但也还有一些领导同志仅仅满足于组织起来，工作尚停留在一般的组织号召阶段，对于通过学习实现思想领导、提高干部及推动工作的重要性认识不足。这是必须纠正的。
    关于组织中、初级干部进行政治理论学习的最有效方式是恰当地利用业余时间，成立业余党校，使不能自修或不能完全自修马克思列宁主义的干部，能够循序地系统地来进行学习。根据沈阳经验，这种组织形式深受干部欢迎。如有的干部说：“这样一来大家可以按部就班地、在一定组织的指导下很好地学习理论了。”
    另外，市委举办的“理论学习室”也是一个很好的经验。由于有了理论学习室，就开始有人研究专门课程，对帮助高级干部自学和指导中、初级组干部学习，对开办教员、辅导员训练班，对统一教学计划、供给干部学习资料和教员讲授提纲，解答疑难问题等方面，都起了显著的作用。
    为了巩固干部学习成果，贯彻理论与实际相结合的学习方法是很重要的。去年八月，沈阳市高、中级组干部参加学习“列宁斯大林论社会主义经济建设”，那时正当我们国家即将开始大规模经济建设的前夜，广大干部都迫切感到要以经济知识来武装自己。经过这次学习，使许多领导干部基本上脱离了只凭经验或零碎知识应付工作的状态，学习情绪也日益高涨。
    目前沈阳市干部教育工作中所存在的问题，首先是编组不严、水平悬殊，因而影响到学习效果。根据经验，凡文化程度不足初中毕业者一律应以学文化为主，辅以政治常识课；文化程度较高且有一些政治理论基础者，可升入初级业余党校。因此，市委决定从今年起，由各单位在业余党校下办干部文化学习部；同时计划将中级业余党校加以扩大，使由去年的一千七百余人发展到八千人。这样就可以免除文化低的同志“费力大而收获小”的苦境；一些具有大学文化程度的干部也不致再感到学习“政治常识”不满足。
    其次，全市业余党校四百余教员中约四分之一到三分之一的同志讲课还不能满足学员要求。今后计划从办好教员训练班、加强“理论学习室”着手提高兼职教员的教学水平。同时实行组织若干人讲授同一内容，巡回讲授，这样可以使教员驾轻就熟，同时也减少备课时间。为了确实保证业余党校课程的进行，市委决定各业余党校，除兼职教员外还要配备一至二个专职教员。同时还拟组织一个二十人左右的专职讲师团，主要担任初级业余党校课程，以逐渐减少兼职教员课程。
    第三、由于高级知识分子（大学教授、讲师、主任工程师、工程师）的理论学习尚未得到很好的解决，计划从一九五三年二月开始，在市委宣传部统一领导下，成立二至三个业余大学，课程请东北局和市委负责同志担任。（中共沈阳市委宣传部）
