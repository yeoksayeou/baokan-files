The Supervision Division of the Shanxi Provincial Department of Finance has successively inspected the expenditure of public funds by 56 units, including the Shanxi Provincial People's Government's Department of Agriculture, Department of Health, and Department of Education. The inspection revealed that even after the Three-Anti Campaign, various units still exhibited serious violations of financial expenditure regulations and wasted state funds. The inspection also proved that it is essential for financial departments to effectively supervise the use of state funds by various departments, oppose waste, and practice strict economy.

The Shanxi Provincial Forestry Bureau expanded its public funds budget last year, but only 11 percent of the budgeted amount was spent by the end of the year. The remainder was either returned or carried over as a year-end surplus. The Provincial Department of Education budgeted 15.2 billion yuan last year for increasing classes and schools, but 9.4 billion yuan remained unallocated as of November. The department's expenditure of public funds lacked planning, with designated funds not being used for their intended purpose, violating financial discipline. Fearing that the state would freeze the remaining funds at the end of the year, the department rushed to allocate the funds. As a result, various schools spent money hastily, resulting in significant waste. Many middle schools used this money to buy pianos, record players, records, sofas, stoves, stovepipes, and gauze for use in the summer of this year, while others made up for past expenditures exceeding regulations. The equipment of the Shanxi Provincial Maternity and Child Health Hospital cannot meet the actual needs of the people. However, according to regulations, the hospital's stockpiled materials and funds could be used to add another 90 beds, which is two-thirds more than the hospital's existing beds. Based on the above inspection materials, the amount of state funds wasted by various departments reached 10 billion yuan.

The Supervision Division of the Shanxi Provincial Department of Finance was established in April 1951, but because leading cadres did not pay enough attention to financial supervision and the supervision was not strict enough, financial discipline was relaxed. After this inspection, the department will continue to conduct a comprehensive inspection of the use of funds by relevant agencies at all levels this year. (Xinhua News Agency)

    山西省财政厅检查各单位事业费开支情况
    山西省人民政府财政厅监察处先后检查了山西省人民政府农业厅、卫生厅、教育厅等五十六个单位事业费的开支情况，发现在三反以后，各单位仍存在着严重的违反财政开支制度浪费国家资金的现象。经过检查，也证明财政部门切实监督各部门对国家资金的使用，反对浪费，厉行节约，是十分必要的。
    山西省林业局去年扩大事业费预算，到年底仅支出预算数百分之十一，其余一部分退还，一部分年终结余。省教育厅去年预算增加班次、增加学校的费用一百五十二亿元，到去年十一月还有九十四亿元没有分配下去。该厅事业费开支没有计划，专款不专用，违犯财政纪律，待到年终，怕国家将这笔余款冻结，就临时赶快分配下去。结果各学校突击花钱，浪费很大。许多中学校用这笔钱买了钢琴、电唱机、唱片、沙发、灶具、烟筒和今年夏天用的纱布等，有的弥补了过去的超制度开支。山西省立妇幼保健院的设备不能满足人民实际需要，但该院积压的物资和资金，按规定却可再增设九十个床位，比该院现有床位多三分之二。根据以上检查材料，各部门浪费国家资金达一百亿元。
    山西省人民政府财政厅监察处是一九五一年四月建立的，但因为领导干部不重视财政监察工作，监督不严，使财政纪律松弛。经过这次检查后，该厅将在今年继续对各级有关机关的资金使用情况，进行一次普遍的检查。（新华社）
