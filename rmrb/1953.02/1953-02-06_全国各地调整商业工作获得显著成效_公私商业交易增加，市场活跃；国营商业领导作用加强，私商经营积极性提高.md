Since the adjustment of commercial work across the country, both public and private commercial transactions have increased, and the market has become increasingly active. According to statistics from the nine major markets of Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Qingdao, Hankou, Guangzhou, Chongqing, Xi'an, and Shenyang, the transaction volume of flour in December 1952 increased by 26.8% compared to November, rice increased by 21.5%, soybeans increased by 12.3%, calico increased by 15.5%, and corn increased by 6.6%. The total turnover of the six markets in Kaifeng, Zhengzhou, Xuchang, Luoyang, Shangqiu, and Luohe in Henan Province rose by 30.3% in December last year compared to November. The transaction volume of both public and private commercial enterprises increased simultaneously. From a national perspective, comparing December with November, the total sales volume of grain by state-owned companies increased by 26.34%, vegetable oil increased by 32.8%, coal increased by 37.2%, kerosene increased by 15.3%, and general merchandise increased by 6.1%. Regarding private commerce, according to statistics from 191 typical households in 29 major industries in Shanghai, the turnover in December last year increased by 18.32% compared to November and by 6.77% compared to the same period of the previous year. Among them, rice increased by 26.7%, local specialties increased by 45%, cotton cloth increased by 49.88%, new medicines increased by 43.62%, and hardware increased by 16.48%. The turnover of five companies including Wing On, Sincere, and The Sun increased by 67.8%, creating the highest record in three years. The turnover of private commerce in Zhejiang Province generally increased by 30% compared to the previous month.

In the situation of simultaneous increase in the turnover of public and private commerce, state-owned trade implemented the policy of focusing on wholesale, consolidated the leading position of the state-owned economy in the market; private commerce obtained a wide range of activities in the retail business, truly realizing the policy of division of labor and cooperation, with each getting what they deserved. For example, comparing the seven days before and after the adjustment of commerce by state-owned companies in Tianjin, the wholesale volume of flour increased by 82%, rice increased by two times, woolen sweaters increased by three times, and Sparrow brand towels increased by nine times, while during the same period, the total retail sales decreased by 4.4%. According to statistics from seven industries in the city, the turnover in December last year increased by 8.8% compared to November. Comparing the average daily turnover of the Baoding Department Store for a ten-day period after the adjustment of commerce with the average daily turnover for a month before the adjustment of commerce, wholesale increased by 28.3%, and retail decreased by 43.6%.

Due to the increase in public and private commercial transactions, urban and rural exchanges have become more active. The number of small-town vendors buying industrial products in secondary markets is increasing. Private merchants in secondary markets are actively going to the countryside to purchase goods and participate in material exchange meetings. This has promoted the large-scale marketing of agricultural and sideline products from farmers, turning slow-selling local products into fast-selling goods.

The business confidence of private industrialists and merchants is increasing day by day. Some private industrialists and merchants are actively increasing capital and employees, and some shops that were originally preparing to close down are actively operating their businesses.

The current problems are that some private business owners still have the idea of ​​solely relying on government loans and demanding unlimited expansion of price differences, and illegal phenomena of speculative price increases have occurred in some areas, which must be corrected. At the same time, due to the complexity of regional price differences, seasonal price differences, and quality price differences, there are still some shortcomings in the administrative management of primary markets in some areas, which need to be further rationally adjusted and improved in the future.

    全国各地调整商业工作获得显著成效
    公私商业交易增加，市场活跃；国营商业领导作用加强，私商经营积极性提高
    全国各地自调整商业以来，公私商业交易都有增加，市场日趋活跃。据北京、天津、上海、青岛、汉口、广州、重庆、西安、沈阳九大市场统计，一九五二年十二月面粉成交量比十一月增加百分之二十六点八，大米增加百分之二十一点五，大豆增加百分之十二点三，花布增加百分之十五点五，玉米增加百分之六点六。河南开封、郑州、许昌、洛阳、商邱、漯河六个市场去年十二月份总营业额比十一月上升百分之三○点三。公私营商业的成交量是同时增加的。从全国来看，以十二月和十一月比较，国营公司粮食总销售量增加百分之二六点三四，植物油增加百分之三二点八，煤炭增加百分之三七点二，煤油增加百分之一五点三，百货增加百分之六点一。从私营商业看，据上海二九个主要行业中一九一个典型户的统计，去年十二月份营业额比十一月份上升百分之一八点三二，比前年同期上升百分之六点七七。其中大米增加百分之二六点七，南货增加百分之四五，棉布增加百分之四九点八八，新药增加百分之四三点六二，五金增加百分之一六点四八。永安、先施、大新等五个公司营业额增加百分之六七点八，创造了三年来的最高纪录。浙江省私营商业营业额一般较上月增加百分之三○。
    在公私营商业营业额同时上升的情况中，国营贸易贯彻了以批发为主的方针，巩固了国营经济在市场上的领导地位；私营商业在零售业务中获得了广泛活动的场所，真正实现了分工合作，各得其所的政策。如天津国营公司调整商业前后七天比较，面粉批发量增加了百分之八二，大米增加了二倍，绒衣增加了三倍，麻雀毛巾增加了九倍，而同期中，零售销货总额却减少了百分之四点四。而根据该市七个行业的统计，去年十二月份的营业额比十一月增加了百分之八点八。保定市百货公司调整商业后一旬与调整商业前一月的每日平均营业额比较，批发增加百分之二八点三，零售减少百分之四三点六。
    由于公私营商业交易的增加，城乡交流就更加活跃了。小城镇商贩到中级市场买工业品的越来越多。中级市场的私商纷纷下乡采购和参加物资交流会。这样就促使农民的土产品大量上市，使滞销土产变为畅销货。
    私营工商业者的经营信心日益提高了。有的私营工商业者主动地增加资本，增加职工，有些原来准备歇业的商店，都积极地经营业务了。
    目前的问题是某些私营商业主还存在着单纯依赖政府贷款，要求无限制地扩大差价的思想，某些地区已发生投机涨价的违法现象，这是必须纠正的。同时，由于地区差价、季节差价、品质差价等问题比较复杂，某些地区的初级市场的行政管理上还有一些缺点，都需要今后进一步合理地加以调整和改善。
