The people who build Berlin
Ma Feng

East Berlin, like the flowers and grass in a spring field, is struggling out of the thawing soil, growing from among the withered branches and fallen leaves.

Everyone knows that at the end of World War II, the city of Berlin was scarred by the ruthless flames of war. The heinous war provoked by Hitler not only destroyed the happiness of other countries but also brought profound suffering to the German people. The German people will never forget: when the war was about to end and East Germany was about to be liberated by the Soviet army, American planes indiscriminately bombed the city, carrying out a vicious conspiracy to destroy the original construction. These merchants of death, waving the banner of anti-fascism, poured thousands upon thousands of bombs from the sky above cultural monuments, from the sky above hospitals, schools, and residential areas. Countless buildings became ruins, and countless peaceful residents were buried in the rubble.... At that time, Berlin was a city riddled with holes.

Now, the city of Berlin is rapidly changing its face. With the assistance of the great Soviet Union, the German people are using their own hands to clear away the ruins caused by the war and rebuild their capital.

In the evening, whenever we walk on the streets of East Berlin, we often see countless people working in front of the ruins of those broken walls. The temporary lights illuminate the area as if it were daytime, the earthmoving machines rumble, shovels and hoes glint under the lights, and trucks loaded with rubble come and go at high speed. Here are workers who have just left their machines; there are employees who have come out of various office buildings; there are students who have returned from school, professors, writers, artists.... Among these people are white-haired old men, children with innocent faces, sturdy young men, and beautiful girls. They have just left their work posts and immediately thrown themselves into the ranks of voluntary labor. People are rebuilding their capital with unparalleled enthusiasm. In the quiet night sky, the songs of labor and cheerful laughter are everywhere.

On Sundays, the ruins are even more lively. The crowds participating in voluntary labor, carrying red flags and singing songs, pour in from all directions. Various organizations, factories, and schools come in formation, and some come in trucks. They bring their own food and tools, as if they were attending a grand gathering. Every German person is honored to be able to participate in this historically significant voluntary labor. People from all over the country who come to Berlin, even if they only stay for one day, will take some time out to do voluntary labor. Workers and citizens of West Berlin, passing through the checkpoints of the American occupation forces and the puppet government, also come to this free land to do voluntary labor. Many international friends who come to Berlin cannot help but join in this great movement. One snowy night, we also did three hours of voluntary labor. Although the time was short and the achievements were small, it still showed the wishes of the Chinese people. Everyone is willing to contribute their share to the reconstruction of Berlin. People know that even if they only move one brick or dig one shovel of soil, it will speed up the recovery and construction of Berlin by one second. People are working hard to achieve the construction plan as soon as possible. Many people have set their own goals: to participate in one hundred shifts of voluntary labor (three hours per shift), five hundred shifts, one thousand shifts....

Seventy-eight-year-old Paul Mickel, a bricklayer, had long since retired, but he still volunteered to participate in voluntary labor. His voluntary labor certificate already records six hundred and ninety shifts, and he wants to strive to reach one thousand shifts. He said to us:

"War is the worst thing. I built houses all my life, and they were all destroyed, all destroyed!" His white beard glistened under the lights, and his face was a solemn expression. He then waved his hand in the air and said: "It doesn't matter, we will build new ones, and I believe I can still see the new Berlin!"

This old man's determination is the determination of all the people of Berlin. Berlin is changing every minute. We have visited the workers' residential area under large-scale construction more than once. Although the time interval is not long, it shows its different postures each time. This is a street named after Stalin. This street is three and a half li long. In the past, this was also a residential area for the working people. The houses were low and dilapidated, and the facilities were very simple. But in the war, it became a bombing target for American planes. Ninety-five percent of the houses were destroyed. The construction project here officially started in February 1952. In less than a year, it has completely changed its original appearance. The people of the whole country donated money, materials, and labor, which made this construction project proceed rapidly. On both sides of the wide street, construction materials are piled up everywhere, and tall scaffolding is erected everywhere. High-rise buildings are approaching completion day by day. Small trains transporting materials are running back and forth on temporary light railways, cranes, road rollers, cement mixers... are constantly turning, making a "rumbling" sound. Electric welders are emitting light blue sparks, and production news is being broadcast on loudspeakers. This is a large-scale construction site, and it is also a battlefield for labor emulation.

Architects, sculptors, bricklayers, carpenters, painters, welders... workers from all walks of life volunteered to come from all over the country, and everyone wants to contribute all their skills to the construction of the capital. Large-scale labor emulation campaigns were launched between teams, groups, and individuals, and work efficiency was constantly improving. Soviet experts have provided a lot of help in the entire construction project. Excellent Soviet architects came here to personally demonstrate and impart advanced experience. Previously, a bricklayer could lay a thousand bricks a day, but after adopting the Soviet three-person operation method, the speed increased fourfold. The workers also demonstrated a high degree of enthusiasm and creativity, new inventions and creations continued to emerge, and production records were constantly being improved. Carl Lisztow, a worker who transported bricks and tiles, improved the transportation cart, which not only reduced physical labor but also increased efficiency threefold. Construction worker Brandel invented a lightweight crane that can be moved to each floor, overcoming the difficulties of the crane's movement as the building increases in height, and thus won the title of meritorious inventor. Bricklayer Walter Mertel improved the plastering mud board and operating method, which increased work efficiency eightfold. We visited Max Schwelb, a painter who had won the title of labor model twice. He changed from painting with a brush to air-pressure spraying, which accelerated the painting work in the entire construction project several times. Schwelb is an old painter, and he told us: "There has never been such labor enthusiasm as there is now. I personally experienced that today workers are truly masters. Today, instead of making cannons, we are building the people's capital, building houses for ourselves and our friends!" He also said: "The German people resolutely oppose war, but we also understand that peace is more guaranteed only by strengthening our own strength!"

This is the reason why German workers are actively producing. They are working hard to fight for peace and also striving for their own happy lives.

The construction of Stalin Avenue fully demonstrates the prospect of a happy life for German workers. There will be various state-owned shops, cinemas, theaters, parks, sports fields and other entertainment venues on this street. And every building, every house, has modern facilities. We visited the completed Weibulweise Building, an eight-story building with a public intercom installed at the entrance, next to which are dozens of buttons with the names of the residents written on them. Pressing any button can talk to that family. More than 30 households live in this building, all of whom are outstanding production models. The elevator took us to the seventh floor, where we visited a worker's family. The husband is a construction worker, and the wife is a people's police officer. They have both gone to work. An elderly neighbor lady received us. Everything here is new, and the smell of paint is everywhere. The houses are very exquisite and practical, with bedrooms, living rooms, kitchens, bathrooms, storage rooms, and facilities such as electric lights, running water, and heating. Every house, every small place, fully demonstrates the wisdom of the architects. The top floor of this building is a rooftop garden, with many potted plants in the glass greenhouse, and several tap shower heads are installed in front of the eaves outside. In the summer, the workers can shower and sunbathe here. The old lady told us that more than 40,000 people have come to visit here, and workers and citizens from West Berlin often come to visit as well. Comrade Protmann, who accompanied us on the visit, said: "In a while, I'm afraid no one will come, because more beautiful buildings will appear!" He is from the State Construction Committee, and he told us that on Stalin's birthday, another 2,200 houses will be completed, and many workers will move to new homes again.

    建设柏林的人们
    马烽
    东柏林，像春天原野上的花草，从解冻的泥土里挣扎出来了，从枯枝败叶当中生长起来了。
    谁都知道，在第二次世界大战的末尾，柏林市被无情的战火烧伤了。希特勒挑起的罪恶战争，不仅破坏了别的国家的幸福，同时给德国人民也带来了深重的灾难。德国人民永远不能忘记：在战争就快结束，东德将要被苏军解放的时候，美国飞机在这里滥肆轰炸，进行破坏原有建设的毒辣阴谋。这批人命贩子们，打着反法西斯的旗帜，却把千千万万颗炸弹从文化古迹的上空，从医院、学校和居民区的上空倾泻下来，无数的建筑物成了废墟，无数的和平居民被埋葬在瓦砾堆中……。那时，柏林是布满了千疮百孔的城市。
    现在，柏林市正在迅速地改变着自己的面貌。在伟大苏联的援助下，德国人民正在用自己的双手，清除战争造成的废墟，重新建设自己的首都。
    傍晚，每当我们在东柏林街道上走过的时候，经常看到在那些破垣残壁的废墟堆前，有着无数的人在劳动。临时安装起的电灯，照耀得如同白昼，装土机“隆隆”地转动着，锹镢在电灯下闪闪发光，载满瓦砾的卡车来往飞驰。这里有刚离开机器的工人；有从各机关办公室走出来的职员；有放学回来的学生，有教授、作家、艺术家……。这些人当中，有白发苍苍的老人，也有满脸稚气的儿童；有壮实的小伙子，也有漂亮的姑娘。他们刚离开自己的工作岗位，马上又投身到义务劳动的行列里。人们以无比的热情重建自己的首都。在安静的夜空里，到处洋溢着劳动的歌声和愉快的笑声。
    一到星期日，各处废墟堆前更加热闹了，参加义务劳动的人群，打着红旗，唱着歌，从四面八方拥来。各个机关团体，各个工厂学校，排着队来了，坐着卡车来了。他们自己带来了干粮，带来了工具，好像是参加一个盛大的集会。每个德国人，都以能够参加这一具有历史意义的义务劳动为光荣。全国各地凡是来柏林的人，那怕只停留一天，也要抽出一点时间来进行义务劳动。西柏林的工人和市民们，穿过美占领军和傀儡政府的检查哨，也来到这片自由的天地里进行义务劳动，很多来柏林的国际友人们，也情不自禁地卷入了这一伟大运动中。在一个满地白雪的夜晚，我们也进行了三小时的义务劳动，虽然时间很短，成绩不大，但同样表示出了中国人民的心愿。谁都愿意为重建柏林献出自己的一分力量。人们都知道，那怕只搬了一块砖，掘了一锹土，都使得柏林的恢复建设工程加快了一秒钟。人们都在为争取建设计划早日实现而努力。很多人订下了自己的奋斗目标：参加义务劳动一百班
    （每班三小时）、五百班、一千班……。
    七十八岁的老人保尔·米克尔，是一位泥水匠，早已不工作了，但是他仍然自愿来参加义务劳动。在他的义务劳动证上已经记到了六百九十个班，他要争取达到一千个班。他对我们说：
    “战争是最坏的事情。我盖了一辈子房屋，都毁了，都毁了！”他的白胡子在灯光下闪动着，脸上是一付严肃的表情。他随即把手在空中一挥说：“不要紧，我们再盖新的，我相信我还能看到新的柏林！”
    这个老人的决心是全柏林人民的决心。每一分钟柏林都在变化着。我们不只一次地访问了正在大规模建设中的工人住宅区。时间虽然相隔不长，但是每次都显出了它不同的姿态。这是一条以斯大林名字命名的街道，这条街有三华里半长，以往这里也是劳动人民的住宅区，房屋是低矮破旧的，设备十分简陋。但是在战争中这里却成了美国飞机的轰炸目标。百分之九十五的房屋都被炸毁了。这里的建设工程，从一九五二年二月才正式开始，不到一年工夫，已经完全改变了原来的面貌。全国人民捐献金钱，捐献器材，捐献劳动，使这一建设工程迅速地进行着。在那宽阔的街道两旁到处堆积着建筑器材，到处竖立着高大的营造架，一幢挨一幢的高楼大厦，一天天在接近完成。运输器材小火车在临时铺设的轻便铁道上往来奔驰，起重机、压路机、水泥搅拌机……不停地转动着，发出“轰隆轰隆”的响声。电焊器迸射出淡蓝色的火光，扩音器里播送着生产捷报。这里是大规模的建设工地，这里也是劳动竞赛的战场。
    建筑师、雕塑家、泥木工、油漆工、电焊工……各行各业的劳动者，都是从全国各地自愿报名来的，谁都要在建设首都的工程中贡献出自己的全部本领。在队与队间，组与组间，个人与个人间，展开了大规模的劳动竞赛，工作效率在不断提高。在整个建设工程中，苏联专家们给予了很多帮助，苏联优秀的建筑师来这里亲自表演，传授先进经验。以前一个瓦匠一天能砌一千砖，采用了苏联三人操作法后，速度加快了四倍。工人们也发挥了高度的积极性、创造性，新的发明创造不断出现，生产纪录不断在提高。搬运砖瓦的工人卡尔·李士陶改进了搬运小车，不仅减轻了体力劳动，而且效率提高了三倍。建筑工人卜冷得尔，发明了一种轻便的起重机，可以移到各层楼上去，克服了以往楼房增高、起重机移动的困难，因而获得了功勋发明家的称号。泥水匠华尔特·梅特尔改进了抹墙泥板和操作方法，使工作效率提高了八倍。我们访问了两次获得劳动模范称号的油漆工人马克思·许维勃，他把用刷子上漆改成了用气压喷漆，使整个建筑工程中的油漆工作加速了数倍。许维勃是一个老的油漆工人，他告诉我们说：“像现在这样的劳动热情是从来没有过的，我自己切身体验到今天工人是真正当了主人了。今天不是制造大炮，而是建设人民的首都，为自己为朋友造房子！”他还说：“德国人民坚决反对战争，但是我们也懂得，只有壮大自己的力量，和平才更有保证！”
    这就是德国工人积极生产的原因。他们为争取和平而加紧工作，也为自己幸福的生活而努力。
    斯大林大街的建设，充分显示出了德国工人幸福生活的远景。这条街上将有各种国营商店、电影院、剧场、公园、运动场等娱乐场所。而每一幢大厦，每一间房子，都有现代化的设备。我们参观过已经落成的魏卜尔维赛大厦，这是一幢八层高的大楼，门口装有公用通话器，旁边有几十个电钮，上边写着住户的姓名，按那一个电钮就可和那一家通话。这幢楼房里住着三十余户，都是优秀的生产模范。电梯把我们载到了第七层楼上，我们访问了一个工人的家庭，丈夫是建筑工人，太太是人民警察，都上班去了。一位邻居老太太接待了我们。这里一切都是新的，到处飞散着油漆的香味，房舍是很精致而适用的，有寝室、会客室、厨房、洗澡间、储藏室，有电灯、自来水、暖气等设备。每一个房子，每一个细小的地方，都充分表现出建筑师们的智慧。这幢大厦的最上一层，是一个屋顶花园，玻璃暖室内摆着很多盆花草，外边的屋檐前安装着数个自来水莲蓬头，夏天的时候，工人们可以在这里淋浴、晒太阳。那位老太太告我们说，这里已经有四万多人来参观过了，西柏林的工人、市民也常常来访问。陪同我们参观的普罗特曼同志说：“等过些时日恐怕就没人来了，因为更漂亮的大厦出现了！”他是国家建设委员会的，他告诉我们说到斯大林生日，将又有二千二百间房屋落成，很多工人又要搬到新居去了。
