Xinhua News Agency, 1st. The Central Ministry of Culture has issued instructions to the cultural departments of local people's governments, requiring them to urge and assist local theatrical troupes, cultural centers, cinemas, film projection teams and other cultural undertakings to actively participate in the campaign to publicize the Marriage Law, which will be launched nationwide in March this year. The instructions specifically stipulate that state-owned theatrical troupes in various localities should include plays on marriage issues in their annual repertoire, according to the different characteristics and conditions of various types of theatrical troupes and opera genres. Private-run, publicly-assisted theatrical troupes and private theatrical troupes should be encouraged to perform some plays on marriage law publicity on a voluntary basis. After the large-scale Marriage Law implementation campaign begins in March of this year, provincial and municipal state-owned and private theatrical troupes should be organized to perform in rural areas as much as possible. Local cultural centers should organize report meetings, lectures, and symposiums according to local conditions, organize the masses to listen to the radio, read popular readings, comic strips, and pictures about the Marriage Law, hold exhibitions in combination with typical examples of the implementation of the Marriage Law in the local area, publish wall newspapers and blackboards, show slides, and organize amateur cultural groups to perform programs publicizing the Marriage Law. During the campaign, local cinemas should show films on marriage issues; film projection teams should systematically go deep into the countryside to show films and slides.

The Central Ministry of Culture has also drafted a list of plays on marriage issues for local theatrical troupes to refer to and choose from. These plays are divided into two parts: (1) Modern plays: "For Happiness" (large-scale opera), "The Person Who Can't Be Locked Up" (small-scale opera), "Between Husband and Wife" (one-act play), "Luo Han Qian" (Shanghai opera), "Zhao Xiaolan" (one-act play), "Little Son-in-Law" (Ping opera), "New Things Done in a New Way" (Henan opera), "Willow Well" (Henan opera), "Marriage" (opera), "Liu Qiao'er" (Ping opera); (2) Historical plays: "The Butterfly Lovers" (Yue opera), "Liu Yin Ji" (Sichuan opera), "The Tale of the White Snake" (Beijing opera, Yue opera versions), "Peacock Flies Southeast" (Beijing opera), "The Blue Bridge Meeting" (Jianghuai opera), "Romance of the West Chamber" (Yue opera), "The Good Little Sister-in-Law" (Shandong Lü opera), "Three Slaps on the Table" (Beijing opera).
