Leading Cadres of Liaoxi No. 1 Machine Factory Criticized Severely by Workers for Formulating Plans Based on Conservative Norms

The leading cadres of the Liaoxi No. 1 Machine Factory have been severely criticized by workers for formulating this year's production plan based on outdated and conservative norms.

The factory began formulating this year's production plan in mid-November of last year. Although it was revised three times by early January of this year, the plan was still very conservative, and the norms used were far behind the actual situation. For example, the sand-turning workshop had already switched to firing once every three days, but the factory planned to fire once every three and a half days this year; lathe operators were already producing six copper sleeves per worker, but the plan called for two copper sleeves per worker; the practical working hours for fixing rope wheels were 2.31 hours, but the plan called for 4.5 hours; the lowest practical working hours for fitter sprockets were 0.22 hours, but the plan called for two hours. When the factory's leading cadres presented this conservative plan to workshop cadres and workers for discussion, it was immediately severely criticized by cadres and workers. The workers said that this plan was a bureaucratic plan divorced from reality and could not meet the requirements of large-scale economic construction this year. Guo Jizhong, the leader of the lathe operator team, said: "They only tell us to be advanced down here, but they are conservative up there!" Wang Zhiwen, a fitter, said to the cadres of the work team sent to the factory by the Liaoxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party: "Don't mobilize the workers, go and mobilize the leading cadres! As long as the leadership can keep up, we will do whatever the plan calls for!" Wu Enxin, a lathe operator, said: "Six axes should take six hours, but they've set it at 8.4 hours, it's simply nonsense!" The workers demanded a revision of the plan. After discussing the plan to make windlass connecting rods, the workers in Liu Junqi's team immediately reduced the planned working hours from 43.5 hours to 33.5 hours and guaranteed to complete it ahead of schedule. They said: "The country's large-scale economic construction has begun. This time, when formulating the plan, we must include all the potential and tricks we know. Don't hold back like last year, trying to get extra bonuses!"

The main reason why the plan formulated by the factory's leading cadres was far behind the actual situation was their bureaucratic attitude towards enterprise management and their distrust of the power of the workers. From January to October last year, the factory failed to complete its production plan every month, and there were many problems in the management of funds and materials and the use of equipment. In early November of last year, the Liaoxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party sent a work team to the factory to help the factory's leading cadres mobilize the workers to calculate detailed accounts, check tasks, vigorously tap potential, find tricks, and promote advanced experience. As a result, production increased unprecedentedly, production efficiency increased by 1.1 times compared with before, and equipment utilization rate increased by 40 percent. The production tasks for 1952 were therefore completed ahead of schedule and exceeded the target. However, when formulating this year's production plan, the factory's leading cadres believed that these achievements were "temporary phenomena that could not be maintained." They said: the current production efficiency is high because the work team is here to promote it. If the plan is based on the current efficiency, what will happen after the work team leaves? This not only shows that they do not believe in the power of the workers, but also shows that they do not intend to actively find ways to improve enterprise management in order to consolidate and improve the existing production achievements. Precisely for this reason, they did not consider how to tap potential capacity to improve production and quality when formulating the plan. For example, if the radiator workshop added 100 sandboxes, it could increase the production of radiators by 10 to 15 boxes per day and improve product quality. Also, if the crane in the sand-turning workshop were slightly improved, production efficiency could be greatly improved. However, the factory did not consider these issues when formulating the plan.

    辽西第一机械厂领导干部
    根据保守定额制订计划受到职工严厉批判
    辽西第一机械厂领导干部根据过时的保守的定额制订今年的生产计划，受到职工群众的严厉批判。
    该厂从去年十一月中旬起就开始订今年的生产计划，到今年一月上旬止，虽然先后修改了三次，但订出来的计划还是很保守，所采用的定额远远落在实际的后面。如翻沙车间早已改为三天倒一次火，该厂订今年计划时却订为三天半倒一次；车工已经做到每个工车六个铜套，计划中却订为一个工车两个铜套；固定绳轮的实用工时为二点三一工，计划中订为四点五工；钳工链轮的最低实用工时为零点二二工，计划中订为两个工。该厂领导干部把这个保守的计划交给车间干部和工人讨论时，立即受到干部、工人的严厉批判。工人们说，这个计划是脱离实际的官僚主义计划，不能适合今年大规模经济建设的要求。车工班长郭际忠说：“光叫我们下边先进，他们却在上边保守！”钳工王之文对中共辽西省委派到该厂的工作组干部说：“你们别发动工人啦，去发动发动领导干部吧！只要领导工作跟得上，计划到哪儿我们就干到哪儿！”车工吴恩信说：“六根轴定六个工就够了，却定了八点四个工，这简直是瞎扯！”工人要求重新修订计划。刘钧起小组的工人讨论了做卷扬机拉杆计划后，马上把计划工时从四十三点五个工压缩到三十三点五个工，并保证提前完成。他们说：“国家大规模经济建设开始了。这回订计划必须把一切潜力和窍门都订上才行，别再像去年似的留后手，企图领超额奖了！”
    该厂领导干部以官僚主义的态度管理企业，同时不相信职工群众的力量，是他们订的计划远远落后于实际的主要原因。该厂去年一月到十月，每个月都没有完成生产计划，在资金、材料的管理和设备的运用上都有很多问题。去年十一月初，中共辽西省委派工作组到该厂，帮助该厂领导干部发动职工群众算细账、查任务、大力挖潜力、找窍门，推广先进经验。结果生产空前提高，生产效率比以前提高一点一倍，设备运用率提高了百分之四十。一九五二年的生产任务因此得以提前超额完成。但在制订今年的生产计划时，该厂领导干部却认为这些成绩是“一时的现象，不能保持下去。”他们说：现在的生产效率高，是工作组在这里推动的结果。如果根据现在的效率订计划，那么，工作组走后咋办？这不只说明了他们不相信职工的力量，同时也说明了他们根本不打算积极想办法去改善企业管理，以便巩固和提高现有的生产成绩。正因为这个缘故，他们在订计划时就没有考虑如何发掘潜在能力，以提高产量和质量。如暖气片车间只要增加一百副沙箱，每天便可以增加十至十五箱暖气片，并能提高产品质量。又如只要把翻沙车间的吊车稍加改进，便可以把生产效率提高很多。但像这些问题，该厂订计划时都没有考虑。
