The third redemption drawing for the 1950 First Series People's Victory Commodity Bonds was held publicly on the 1st at the Chang'an Grand Theater in Beijing. The meeting was presided over by Rong Zihe, Deputy Minister of Finance of the Central People's Government. Hao Tongsheng, representative of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and Huang Jieran, representative of the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, were invited to the meeting to conduct the drawing. Pan Zhenya, representative of the People's Supervisory Committee of the State Council of the Central People's Government, and representatives of the Financial and Economic Committee of the State Council of the Central People's Government were invited to the meeting to supervise the drawing.

At the beginning of the meeting, Rong Zihe, Deputy Minister of Finance of the Central People's Government, delivered a speech. He first reviewed the state's economic development over the past three years, explaining that the issuance of public bonds played a certain role in the fundamental improvement of the state's financial economy. Our country has begun large-scale economic construction this year. Therefore, all those who have purchased public bonds have contributed to the country. He also analyzed the essential difference between the public bonds issued by the People's Government and those issued by the Kuomintang reactionaries. At the same time, he analyzed the essential difference between the public bonds issued by new democratic countries and socialist countries and those issued by capitalist countries. He said that the public bonds issued by the People's Government are, in general, "taken from the people and used for the people," while the public bonds issued by the Kuomintang reactionaries were for the reactionary class to embezzle and make fortunes. New democratic and socialist countries issue public bonds to develop production, improve people's lives, and defend world peace, while capitalist countries issue public bonds to exploit the majority of their own people, plunder the people of other countries, and seek high profits for monopoly capitalists.

Representatives of industry and commerce from various regions and representatives of the Beijing Municipal People's Congress also spoke at the meeting.

The meeting concluded after the winning numbers were publicly announced. (Xinhua News Agency)

    折实公债第三次还本抽签大会在京举行
    一九五零年第一期人民胜利折实公债第三次还本抽签大会，一日在北京长安大戏院公开举行。大会由中央人民政府财政部副部长戎子和主持。大会邀请了中华全国总工会的代表郝桐生、中华全国工商业联合会筹备委员会的代表黄玠然到会执行抽签，并请了中央人民政府政务院人民监察委员会的代表潘震亚和中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会的代表到会监督抽签。
    大会开始时中央人民政府财政部副部长戎子和讲了话。他首先对过去三年来国家经济发展的情况作了回顾，说明了公债的发行对国家财政经济根本好转是起了一定的作用的。我们国家在今年已开始了大规模的经济建设，因此，凡是购买了公债的人都对国家有贡献。他并分析了人民政府发行的公债与国民党反动派所发行的公债有着本质的不同。同时还分析了新民主主义国家、社会主义国家所发行的公债与资本主义国家发行的公债亦有着本质的不同。他说：人民政府发行的公债总的来说是“取之于民，用之于民”的，而国民党反动派发行的公债则是作为反动阶级贪污、发财的。新民主主义国家、社会主义国家发行公债是用以发展生产、改善人民生活，保卫世界和平的。而资本主义国家发行的公债则是用以剥削本国大多数人民，掠夺其他国家人民，给垄断资本家谋取高额利润的。
    在会上讲话的还有各地的工商界代表和北京市各界人民代表会议的代表。
    大会在公开宣布中签号码后结束。（新华社）
