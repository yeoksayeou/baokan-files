It was already 7:00 PM when I entered the military dependents' production group in Yangfang Hutong Police Station, Xisi District, Beijing. The three-room northern house was brightly lit by electric lights. Several sewing machines were working busily. Several women were bent over, sewing buttonholes. More people came in, each carrying a large bundle. They gathered around the accountant's table, opened the bundles, counted the washed clothes, and checked each other's work to see who washed the cleanest and ironed the smoothest.

This production group was organized by Li Ziliang, Beijing's model for supporting the military, who overcame many difficulties. He told me that the group has three sections: sewing, washing, and buttonholing. The number of people regularly participating in production is thirty to forty, and the buttonholing section can absorb more people when there is a lot of work. From May to December of last year, the whole group earned more than 90 million yuan, improving the lives of the military dependents.

Speaking of Li Ziliang, the two hundred or more military dependents and most of the residents in the Huguosi and Yangfang Hutong police station districts of Xisi District know him. Everyone praises his "wholehearted" spirit of serving military dependents. Originally, he lived in the area under the jurisdiction of the Huguosi Police Station. He served as a district military support committee member and the director of the military support committee of his section. He carefully learned about the family circumstances of all the more than one hundred military dependents in his section: who had labor power, who didn't, who had difficulties in production and life. Based on these specific circumstances, he organized military dependents' production, introduced them to employment, or petitioned the government for subsidies, and often organized people to visit and comfort them. Later, the street where he lived was assigned to the Yangfang Hutong Police Station district, and he quickly became familiar with the family circumstances of most of the military dependents in this district, and did a good job in supporting the military.

Some of the military dependents did not have production skills, had a low level of education, and could not leave their families, making it difficult to introduce them to employment or organize production. In early 1951, Li Ziliang first organized some of them to form a military dependents' laundry group. He and Xu Manying, the street sanitation committee member, collected clothes from nearby organizations and troops every day, and then distributed them to the military dependents' homes to be washed. The spirit of the two of them running around for the military dependents every day moved many people. They automatically sent the clothes they wanted to wash to Li Ziliang's home, or introduced people to hand over their clothes to the military dependents' laundry group. As more and more clothes came in, Li Ziliang purchased soap in large quantities and distributed it to the military dependents, reducing the cost of washing. Sometimes, if some clothes were not washed clean enough, he would keep them and wash them again himself before sending them to the owner. Therefore, people were also satisfied with the work of the military dependents' laundry group. Later, some people also asked the laundry group to do some sewing and mending. There were also more and more such tasks, some of which required relatively complex skills to complete. Therefore, Li Ziliang organized five or six military dependents with sewing machines to form a sewing group. Li Ziliang was still responsible for soliciting work and distributing it to the group members to do at home. At this time, a difficulty was encountered: no one went outside to measure clothes. Li Ziliang himself learned the technique of measuring clothes and helped them do the work of going outside to measure clothes for a period of time.

In the spring of last year, the production group rented a house, concentrated the sewing machines to work, established an accounting system in the group, and everything was on track. In early September, after Beijing re-divided the district boundaries, their production group merged with the military dependents' production group of the original Yangfang Hutong Police Station, and added a buttonholing section, making the scale larger than before. The work they received also increased, and some of them were things that everyone had never done before, and no one dared to cut. Some people who had just joined the sewing group couldn't even sew waistbands and sleeves properly. Li Ziliang went everywhere to find materials to talk to everyone, encouraging them to learn the techniques well and overcome difficulties. Many people in the group had seen the East German film "Daily Bread," and he used the spirit of the German working class overcoming difficulties in construction to encourage everyone. In this way, the military dependents' skills improved quickly. Now, they are able to sew woolen clothes.

While organizing this military dependents' production group, Li Ziliang also paid great attention to introducing military dependents to employment. In the past two years, with his help, hundreds of military dependents have obtained jobs, some of whom have become people's cadres.

In daily life, Li Ziliang is also most able to care for and be considerate of military dependents. Who needs to go to the hospital to give birth, who needs to see a doctor when they are sick, whose children have reached school age and need to find a school, whose walls are broken and need to hire a plasterer, whether they are warm enough in winter, whether the house leaks in summer, and even things like building stoves and moving coffins for military dependents' families, he can help solve them in time. If he cannot solve them himself, he will report them to the district people's government. Once, he heard that military dependent Lu Zhanyuan raised many guinea pigs and couldn't find a buyer. He contacted the government's health agencies and several large pharmaceutical factories outside Qianmen and Hepingmen, and they were all sold. Military dependent Yang Yuchun's child fell ill suddenly and had no money for treatment. He went to the district people's government to open a letter of introduction and helped him send it to the hospital, and went to see him one or two times every day. During a heavy rain night last summer, he was worried about the leaks in the military dependents' houses, so he went to the military dependents' homes to check the houses in the rain until midnight, helping fourteen households move in time. When Beijing first snowed last winter, he visited sixty military dependents' households and was relieved when he saw that everyone was wearing warm cotton clothes. On the night before the Spring Festival this year (February 13), he went to the military dependents' homes to take a look. He went back to his own home only after seeing that everyone had cut meat, bought vegetables, and everything was ready.

Li Ziliang's exemplary deeds have won the sincere love and support of the masses. Volunteer Army military dependent He Wangshi said: "Speaking of Lao Li, he cares about everything. No matter what happens, if you meet him, he will make you smile!" Volunteer Army military dependent Sun old lady said: "When my husband writes to the children, he says: You must make contributions, Mr. Li takes care of my family so well." In this way, Li Ziliang has been selected as a district model for supporting the military twice, and has been selected as a Beijing model for supporting the military.

    组织军属生产，关心军属生活——记北京市优抚模范黎梓梁
    长荣
    已经是下午七点钟了，我走进北京市西四区羊房胡同派出所里的军属生产小组。一所三间大的北房，被电灯光照得通明。几部缝纫机在紧张地工作着。几个妇女在低着头锁扣眼。外面又进来了几个人，每人都夹着一个大包袱。她们围在会计员的桌前，打开包袱，清点着洗净了的衣服，并且在互相检查，看谁洗的最干净，烫的最平。
    这个生产小组，是北京市优抚模范黎梓梁克服了许多困难而组织起来的。他告诉我，小组内有缝纫、洗衣、锁缀三个部分，经常参加生产的有三、四十个人；锁缀部活多时，能吸收更多的人工作。从去年五月到十二月，全组收入了九千多万元，改善了军属们的生活。
    说起黎梓梁，西四区护国寺和羊房胡同派出所的二百多户军属和大部分居民都知道他。人人都称赞他“全心眼”为军属服务的精神。原先，他住的地方属护国寺派出所管区，他担任区优抚委员和段上优抚委员会的主任委员。他细心地了解了全段一百多户军属的家庭情况：谁家有劳动力，谁家无劳动力，谁家在生产上和生活上有困难，他就根据这些具体情况，分别组织军属生产，介绍他们就业或呈请政府补助，并经常组织人去慰问。后来，他住的街道划分到羊房胡同派出所管区，他又很快地熟悉了这个管区内大多数军属的家庭情况，把军属工作做得很好。
    军属中有一部分人没有生产技能，文化水平也低，又不能离开家庭，介绍就业和组织生产都很困难。一九五一年初，黎梓梁首先把他们的一部分组织起来，成立了一个军属洗衣小组。他和街道卫生委员徐曼莹每天到附近机关和部队中收拢衣服，再分送到组内军属家去洗。他们两人每天为军属奔走的精神，感动了许多人，他们自动把要洗的衣服送到黎梓梁家中去，或介绍人们把衣服交军属洗衣组去洗。衣服越来越多，黎梓梁便大批地购入肥皂，分给军属，减低了洗衣成本。有时，有的衣服洗得不够干净，他就留下自己重新洗过，再送给衣主。所以，人们也满意军属洗衣小组的工作。后来有的人还把一些缝缝补补的活计请洗衣小组去做。这样的活计也越来越多，有的需要比较复杂的技术才能完成。于是，黎梓梁又把五、六家有缝纫机的军属组织起来，成立了一个缝纫小组，仍旧由黎梓梁去揽活，分送给各组员在家里做。这时曾遇到一个困难：没有人到外面去量衣服。黎梓梁自己就学会了量衣服的技术，帮她们做了一个时期到外面去量衣服的工作。
    去年春季，生产小组租到了房子，把缝纫机集中起来工作，组内建立了会计制度，一切都走上了轨道。九月初，北京市重新划分区界后，他们这个生产小组和原羊房胡同派出所的军属生产小组合并，并增添了锁缀部，规模比以前更大了，接的活也越来越多，其中有些是大家都没有做过的，没有人敢裁。有些刚参加缝纫的人，连腰坎和袖子都上不好。黎梓梁就到处找材料讲给大家听，鼓励她们学好技术，克服困难。组内许多人过去都看过一次民主德国影片“每日的粮食”，他就用德国工人阶级在建设中克服困难的精神来鼓舞大家。这样，军属们的技术进步很快，现在，她们已经能够缝呢子衣服了。
    在组织这个军属生产小组的同时，黎梓梁还很注意介绍军属就业的工作。两年来，在他的帮助下，上百个军属都获得了职业，其中有的已经成了人民的干部。
    在日常生活中，黎梓梁也最能关心和体贴军属们。谁家生小孩要住医院，谁家有了病要请医生，谁家孩子到了入学年龄要找学校，谁家墙坏了要请泥水匠，冬天穿的是不是够暖，夏季房子是不是漏水，甚至军属家砌火炉、移灵柩等这些事，他都能及时帮助解决，自己不能解决的就报告给区人民政府。有一次，他听说军属陆占元养了许多荷兰鼠，找不到买主。他就到政府的卫生机关和前门外、和平门外的几家大药厂去接洽，结果都卖出去了。军属杨玉春家的小孩得了急病，没钱治疗，他便到区人民政府开了介绍信，帮他送到医院，每天还去看一、二次。去年夏天的一次大雨夜里，他耽心军属屋漏，就冒雨到军属家检查房子，直到午夜十二点，帮助十四户及时搬了家。去年冬季北京初降大雪时，他又挨户访问了六十户军属，看到大家都穿上了暖和的棉衣，心才放下。今年春节的前一天（二月十三日）晚上，他还挨户到军属家去看看。看到大家都割到肉、买到菜，一切都准备齐全，才回到自己家里。
    黎梓梁的模范事迹，获得了群众的衷心热爱和拥护。志愿军军属何王氏说：“要说老黎，什么事都上心。不管什么事情，遇到他，管叫你眉笑颜开！”志愿军军属孙老太太说：“我先生给孩子一写信就说：你要立功呀，黎先生把我家照顾得多好。”就这样，黎梓梁曾两次被选为区优抚模范，并被选为北京市优抚模范。
