We are Determined to Overcome the Disease of Weakness
Anhui Daily Editorial Department

For a long time, our newspaper has not adequately carried out criticism and bottom-up criticism, and as a result, the combat effectiveness of the newspaper has been weak, and it has not sufficiently supported the criticism of the masses, which has caused dissatisfaction among the masses. The "Review of Newspaper Work" in the People's Daily on February 1st made a profound criticism of this error, and pointed out: This error "is related to the extent to which the local Party committee supports newspaper criticism, but the editorial department obviously has a serious disease of weakness, thus abandoning or relaxing the powerful weapon of carrying out criticism in the newspaper." This criticism is completely correct. We fully accept the criticism from the People's Daily and are determined to improve our future work in accordance with the spirit of the criticism from the People's Daily.

In the past, the atmosphere of criticism in our newspaper was weak, and the combat effectiveness was not strong, which was specifically manifested in two aspects: First, there was very little criticism in our newspaper, and the firepower was not strong. For example, from October to December 1952, in addition to publishing 76 pieces of criticism and suggestion submissions in the "Letters from Readers" column, only a dozen pieces of criticism submissions were published in the news section, and among these criticism submissions, except for a few that were more profound, most of them were general criticisms, and did not seize typical bad people and bad deeds for powerful exposure. Second, the struggle was not resolute enough, and many criticisms were just "feints" with no follow-up. Some other submissions were delayed again and again, and it took a long time to see results. For example, after the former Wanbei Daily criticized Lin Jie and encountered resistance, the editorial department of the newspaper did not persist in the struggle, and it ended without resolution. From August to November 1952, a total of 140 pieces of criticism and suggestion submissions were published in the "Letters from Readers" column, and by mid-December, 119 pieces had not yet been answered. Although we conducted general investigations into these units or individuals who refused to reply, we did not seize the main issues among them and conduct serious and conscientious criticism and struggle. As the People's Daily pointed out, "For some cadres, such as the director of the Jiashan County Public Security Bureau who blamed cadres for writing submissions criticizing him for suppressing criticism, only two simple sentences were mentioned. After that, the masses were not mobilized to carry out a resolute struggle against typical bureaucracy, so until recently, the units or individuals named have not made a serious review or reply." Due to the existence of these situations, some readers have doubts about whether criticism in the newspaper is useful, which has damaged the credibility of the newspaper among the masses. For example, Xi Chunrong felt that "Anhui Daily cannot solve the problem" because his criticism of the errors in the implementation of price policies by the Wudian Office of the Native Products Company did not yield results. When he discovered the truth that the Chuxian Branch of the Native Products Company falsely reported achievements to obtain the red flag, he wrote to the People's Daily instead of Anhui Daily. This issue is very serious and should arouse our high vigilance.

The reason why criticism in our newspaper could not be carried out well in the past is inseparable from the guiding ideology of the editorial board, especially the general editorial office. First of all, the principle is not strong, ideological struggle is not carried out, and there is still an irresponsible liberal style of work. For example, in the criticism of Lin Jie, when we encountered setbacks, we compromised and did not have the courage to persist in the struggle. In November 1952, the reader Liu Xiangshan sent a letter to the newspaper reflecting Lin Jie's mistakes in insulting the Party newspaper and detaining cadres. At that time, we advocated public exposure, but Gui Linqi, the Minister of the Provincial Party Committee Propaganda Department, instructed us to hand this matter over to the Discipline Inspection Commission for investigation and handling, and did not agree to publish it immediately. Later, the reader raised opinions several times and questioned whether the newspaper was protecting Lin Jie. Although we repeatedly reflected this situation to Comrade Gui Linqi, we did not insist on the opinion of publishing immediately, so it was delayed again and again. It was not until the Huang Yifeng incident was announced that Lin Jie's problem was "brought into the sunlight." The handling of the Chang Guanghua incident also exposed our ideological struggle not being carried out and the idea of ​​conciliation. Regarding the Chang Guanghua incident, we did not grasp sufficient materials beforehand. It was not until January 24 this year that we heard that the Shanghai Liberation Daily had announced this incident. At this time, we hurriedly collected materials and rushed to write news and short commentaries, and published them together with the decision of the Hefei Municipal Party Committee Discipline Inspection Commission on expelling Chang Guanghua from the Party. At that time, we already knew that Gui Linqi and Su Yiran's handling of this case was wrong, but we still vaguely said that "certain leading comrades once made improper handling," and "it is indeed a lesson worthy of serious attention from leading organs at all levels." Although we had some opinions on the decision of the Hefei Municipal Party Committee Discipline Inspection Commission, we did not resolutely raise them at the time. These facts fully illustrate that our "disease of weakness" in critical struggle is quite serious, and we must resolutely change it in the future.

Second, the mass viewpoint is not strong, there is a lack of understanding of the situation below, insufficient concern for the suffering of the masses, and no due indignation has been aroused by the illegal and disciplinary behaviors of certain cadres. Among the letters from readers, many are exposing the illegal and disciplinary behaviors of certain cadres, but we have not paid serious attention to this issue, and have not planned to select typical events among them to publicly expose in the newspaper, and mobilize the masses to fight against bureaucracy, commandism, and illegal and disciplinary elements; but only published a small part in the "Letters from Readers" column, and the remaining letters were handed over to relevant departments for investigation and handling. Due to our insufficient attention, coupled with some chaos in the work system, many letters could not be answered in time. This has greatly harmed the enthusiasm of the people to carry out criticism in the newspaper, making the newspaper increasingly detached from the masses and detached from reality.

In order to improve work and strengthen the critical struggle in the newspaper, the Anhui Daily Editorial Committee has now convened a special meeting based on the criticism from the People's Daily to conduct a review, and has also conducted a comprehensive inspection of the work of letters from readers. At the same time, it has mobilized all staff members of the editorial department to study the "Review of Newspaper Work" in the People's Daily, and to check their own work in connection with it. We believe that the People's Daily has not only sounded the alarm for us, making us sober, but also given us great support and encouragement in terms of criticism and self-criticism. We are determined to strengthen the study of Marxism-Leninism, improve political consciousness, strengthen principles, overcome the disease of weakness, take the current struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and illegal and disciplinary violations as a starting point, resolutely implement the Central Committee's "Decision on Launching Criticism and Self-Criticism in Newspapers and Publications," so that Anhui Daily truly becomes the mouthpiece of the people of Anhui, and fulfill the glorious tasks entrusted to us by the Party and the people.

### 我们决心克服软弱病

    我们决心克服软弱病
    安徽日报编辑部
    很长时期以来，我们的报纸没有很好地展开批评和自下而上的批评，因而报纸的战斗力就显得不强，支持群众的批评不够，以致引起群众的不满。二月一日人民日报“报纸工作述评”对我们这一错误进行了深刻的批评，并且指出：这一错误“虽然和当地党委支持报纸批评的程度有关，但编辑部显然是有着严重的软弱病，因而放弃了或放松了在报纸上展开批评这一有力的武器。”这一批评是完全正确的。我们完全接受人民日报的批评，并决心根据人民日报批评的精神，切实改进我们今后的工作。
    过去我们报纸上的批评空气稀薄，战斗力不强，具体表现在两方面：首先是我们报纸上的批评很少，而且火力不强。例如一九五二年十月至十二月份除在“读者来信”栏发表过七十六件批评与建议稿外，在新闻版上只发表过十几件批评稿，而这些批评稿中，除了少数稿件批评的较深刻以外，其余大多是泛泛的批评，没有抓住典型的坏人坏事予以有力的揭发。其次是斗争不够坚决，有不少批评都是“虚幌一枪”，再没下文。另外一些稿件，则是一拖再拖，经过很长时间才能见到结果。例如前皖北日报批评林杰遭到抗拒后，该报编辑部也未坚持斗争，最后就不了了之。一九五二年八月至十一月
    “读者来信”栏一共发表过一百四十件批评与建议稿，到十二月中旬仍然有一百十九件没有得到答复。对于这些拒绝答复的单位或个人，我们虽然进行了一般的追查，但并没有抓住其中主要的问题，进行严肃认真的批评和斗争。正如人民日报所指出的，“对其中某些干部如嘉山县公安局局长责备干部不该写稿批评他压制批评的行为，只简单地提了两句。此后也没有发动群众对典型的官僚主义进行坚决斗争，因此直到最近仍不见被指名的单位或个人作出认真的检讨或答复。”由于这些情况的存在，有一部分读者就对报纸上的批评是否有用发生怀疑，这就损害了报纸在群众中的威信。例如席春荣因批评土产公司武店办事处执行价格政策的错误没有得到结果，就感到“安徽日报不能解决问题”。当他发现土产公司滁县支公司谎报成绩骗取红旗的真相时，就写给人民日报，而不再写给安徽日报了。这一问题是十分严重的，应引起我们高度的警惕。
    过去我们报纸上的批评所以不能很好的开展，和编委会特别是总编室的领导思想分不开的。首先是原则性不强，思想斗争不开展，还存在着不负责任的自由主义作风。例如对林杰的批评，当遇到挫折后，我们就妥协下来，没有再坚持斗争的勇气。一九五二年十一月，读者刘象山就曾给报社辑编来信反映林杰辱骂党报，扣押干部的错误行为。当时我们主张公开揭发，省委宣传部部长桂林栖，则指示我们把这件事交纪律检查委员会查明处理，不同意马上发表。以后读者又几次提出意见，并质问报社是否包庇林杰。我们虽一再把这情况反映给桂林栖同志，但并未坚持马上发表的意见，所以就
    一拖再拖。直到黄逸峰事件公布后，这才把林杰的问题“拉到日光下来”。对常光华事件的处理，也同样暴露了我们思想斗争不开展和调和主义的思想。对常光华事件，我们事前并未掌握到充分的材料。直到今年一月二十四日听说上海解放日报已公布了这一事件，这时我们才仓促地搜集材料，赶写新闻和短评，和中共合肥市委纪律检查委员会关于开除常光华党籍的决定一齐发表。当时，我们已经知道桂林栖和苏毅然对这一案件的处理是错误的，但我们仍然含混其词地只说“某些领导同志曾经一度作出不当的处理”，“确实是值得各级领导机关严重注意的教训”。对合肥市委纪律检查委员会的决定，我们虽有一些意见，但当时也未坚决提出。这些事实都充分说明，我们在批评斗争中的“软弱病”是相当严重的，今后必须坚决转变。
    第二是群众观点不强，对下边的情况缺乏了解，对群众的疾苦不够关心，对某些干部违法乱纪的行为，没有引起应有的义愤。在读者来信当中，有不少是揭发某些干部违法乱纪行为的，但我们并未严重地注意这一问题，有计划地选择其中的典型事件在报纸上公开进行揭发，并发动群众向官僚主义、命令主义以及违法乱纪分子进行斗争；而只是在“读者来信”栏里发表了一小部分，其余来信则都交由有关部门调查处理。由于我们重视不足，再加上工作制度中的某些混乱，就使很多来信不能及时得到解答。这就大大伤害了人民群众在报纸上进行批评的积极性，使报纸日益脱离群众，脱离实际。
    为改进工作，加强报纸上的批评斗争，现在安徽日报编辑委员会已根据人民日报的批评，召开专门会议进行了检讨，对读者来信工作也进行了全面的检查。同时并发动编辑部全体工作人员学习人民日报的“报纸工作述评”，联系检查自己的工作。我们认为人民日报不仅对我们敲了警钟，使我们清醒过来，并且在批评与自我批评方面给了我们极大的支持和鼓舞。我们决心加强马克思列宁主义的学习，提高政治觉悟，加强原则性，克服软弱病，以当前反对官僚主义、反对命令主义、反对违法乱纪的斗争为起点，坚决贯彻中央“关于在报纸刊物上展开批评和自我批评的决定”，使安徽日报真正成为安徽人民的喉舌，完成党和人民所交给我们的光荣任务。
