    Experiences Gained from the "Comparative" Test of Lightning Arresters

    We have taken a rather winding path in learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union.

    In the past, we always thought that the Soviet Union was a continental country with few thunderstorms, so the lightning arresters they manufactured might not necessarily be good. Last year, during the second quarter, when we were jointly conducting research and development of high-voltage lightning arresters with Fushun Electrical Engineering Tenth Factory, we collected drawings of the main types of lightning arresters from various countries (including the new Soviet arrester from 1952) for "comparative" testing, preparing to "draw on strengths and avoid weaknesses" to redesign. On the surface, we seemed very "objective," but in essence, this was an attitude of doubting Soviet science.

    After two months of "comparative" testing, we discovered the shortcomings of lightning arresters manufactured in capitalist countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom: Their gaps, with good voltage-time characteristics, often had very poor follow current interruption capabilities (often requiring separate follow current interruption devices), and the structure was complex, with poor performance. Soviet lightning arresters not only lacked these shortcomings, but also, because high-voltage lightning arresters used arresters of unequal voltage units strung together, they met the requirements for voltage distribution characteristics. Furthermore, they were very simple to manufacture. If the production of arresters of thirty "kilovolts" or less was successful, the entire problem of manufacturing high-voltage arresters could be solved. For example, to manufacture a sixty "kilovolt" arrester, you would only need to connect two thirty "kilovolt" arresters together.

    However, by mid-August of last year, the factory had already completed the design work for ten "kilovolt" to thirty "kilovolt" arresters according to the American "Westinghouse" design, and had already made most of the parts. If we were to change the design and prototype, it would affect the completion of production tasks. But we knew that the factory's "new" design was not only uncertain, but even if it was successfully produced, it would encounter more difficulties when mass-produced. Therefore, we insisted on the idea of changing the design and boldly made a guarantee to the factory, demanding that they abandon the past drawings and prototype according to the Soviet arrester drawings. Finally, the factory leadership accepted our opinion and completed the trial production. It is estimated that the task of manufacturing 220 "kilovolt" high-voltage lightning arresters can be completed ahead of schedule.

    Subsequently, we put the Soviet lightning arrester gaps on the medium-voltage lightning arresters produced by the Electrical Engineering Tenth Factory, which significantly improved the follow current interruption performance. The maximum allowable operating voltage reached about 150% of the original (similar to some designs of American "Westinghouse"). At our suggestion, the factory carried out the production of new gaps, which greatly improved the quality and eliminated the failure rate caused by the follow current test. Recently, we tested the medium-voltage lightning arresters trial-produced by the Nanjing Electric Porcelain Factory, which proved that their performance was not strong. We immediately changed to the Soviet honeycomb gap configuration. The test results showed that the performance had been greatly improved (it can be formally produced after the gap is redesigned). We also made suggestions to the factory leadership, stipulating that the type approval standards and design should be manufactured according to Soviet standards.

    In terms of impulse high-voltage testing, we also switched to using Soviet standards as the basis. This laid a good foundation for the manufacture of lightning arresters.

    From the "comparative" test of lightning arresters, we deeply realized the superiority of Soviet science and technology. For example, Soviet lightning arresters do not look beautiful on the outside, but their performance is unmatched by other countries. The thirty "kilovolt" arrester is a clear example, its maximum allowable operating voltage is close to twice the line operating voltage.

    The facts have taught us that if we cannot well accept the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, our research work will not have greater improvements.

    从避雷器的“比较”试验中得到的体会
    中国科学院长春综合研究所副研究员　韩朔
    在学习苏联先进经验的道路上，我们是走得相当曲折的。
    过去，我们一直认为，苏联是个大陆国，雷雨不多，所制避雷器不一定见得好。在去年第二季度和抚顺电工第十厂共同进行高压避雷器试制研究工作的时候，我们曾搜集了各国的主要型式避雷器的图样（包括苏联一九五二年新出的避雷器）进行“比较”试验，准备“取长补短”，重新设计。从表面上看来，我们好像很“客观”，实质上这是一种对苏联科学表示怀疑的态度。
    经过两个来月的“比较”试验，我们发现了美、英等资本主义国家所制避雷器的缺点：它的间隙多半是电压时间特性好的往往续流遮断能力很差（常另备有续流遮断装置），且构造复杂，性能又不好。而苏联的避雷器不仅没有这些缺点，且并因为高压避雷器用不等电压单位的避雷器串起来使用，就满足了电压分布特性上的要求；制作起来又十分简便。如果三十“仟伏”以下单位的避雷器试制成功，整个高压避雷器的制作问题即可解决。例如，要制作六十“仟伏”的避雷器时，只要把两个三十“仟伏”的避雷器连起来就行了。
    可是到去年八月中旬，工厂里已按照美国“西屋公司”的式样完成了十“仟伏”到三十“仟伏”避雷器的设计工作，而且已作出大部的零件。如要改型试作，就要影响到生产任务的完成。但我们知道，该厂的“新”设计不但没有把握，而且即或制作成功，在进行大量生产时一定会遇到更多困难。因此，我们坚持改型的主张，并大胆地向该厂提出了保证，要求放弃过去的图样，重新按苏联避雷器的图样试制。最后，工厂领导方面接受了我们的意见，完成了试制工作。估计可以提前完成制作二二○“仟伏”高压避雷器的任务。
    随后，我们把苏联避雷器的间隙配置在电工第十厂生产的中压避雷器上，使续流遮断性能获得显著提高，最高容许使用电压可达原型（和美国“西屋公司”的某种设计相似）的百分之一百五十左右。在我们的建议下，该厂进行了新间隙的生产，这样就大大地提高了质量，消灭了因续流试验而造成的不合格率。　最近我们又试验了南京电瓷厂试制的中压避雷器，证明其性能不强。我们即改以苏联蜂窝间隙配置，试验结果，性能有很大改进（一待间隙改型后便可正式生产）。我们并向该厂领导方面提出建议，定型标准和设计均按苏联标准制作。
    在冲击高压试验方面，我们也改以苏联的标准为依据。这为避雷器的制造奠定了一个良好的基础。
    从避雷器的“比较”试验中，我们深深地认识到苏联科学技术的优越性。例如，苏联的避雷器在外表上看来并不华美，但其性能则为其他国家的所不及，三十“仟伏”的避雷器就是一个明显的例子，其最高容许使用电压竟接近线路使用电压的二倍。
    事实教育了我们：如果不能很好地接受苏联的先进经验，我们的研究工作便不会有更大的改进。
