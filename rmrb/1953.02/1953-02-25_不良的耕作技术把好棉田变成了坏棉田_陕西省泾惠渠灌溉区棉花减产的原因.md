Poor Farming Techniques Turned Good Cotton Fields into Bad Cotton Fields
——Reasons for Cotton Production Reduction in the Jinghui Canal Irrigation Area of Shaanxi Province

Editor's Note: This article is compiled based on the investigation report of the "Shaanxi Province Jinghui Canal Irrigation Area Cotton Production Reduction Investigation Group" composed of the Central Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Water Resources, the Northwest Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, the Ministry of Water Resources, the Shaanxi Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry, the Bureau of Water Resources, and other relevant agencies, and the "Masses Daily" report on this issue. From this article, we can see the enormous losses that a lack of technical understanding and a generalized leadership style can cause to the country and the people. This should not only be closely noted by leading cadres in all irrigated cotton-growing areas, but also should serve as a warning to all cadres engaged in rural work across the country.

Huge Losses

Jingyang, Sanyuan, Gaoling, and Lintong counties, within the Jinghui Canal irrigation area, are the main cotton-producing areas of Shaanxi Province. The yield per unit area of cotton in this area has been quite high for more than a decade, with an average yield of approximately 70 jin of ginned cotton per mu in normal years. The quality of the cotton is also generally good, with an average fiber length of one inch and very uniform. After liberation, local farmers underwent various social reform movements and launched patriotic production increase campaigns, showing great enthusiasm for production. The irrigated cotton field area increased to 420,000 mu in 1952 (previously around 300,000 mu). However, the yield per unit area of cotton in the area has been decreasing year by year. In 1950, the average yield was more than 50 jin of ginned cotton per mu; in 1951, it decreased to 40 jin; and in 1952, it further decreased to 25 jin, which was even lower than the yield of dryland cotton in the same year. The quality of cotton also showed a downward trend. This is a huge loss for the country and for the local cotton farmers. Taking 1952 as an example: the average yield of 25 jin of ginned cotton per mu was more than 40 jin less than the usual yield. Even if calculated at a reduction of 40 jin per mu, the total reduction in production in the 420,000 mu of irrigated cotton fields would be nearly 170,000 dan of ginned cotton. 170,000 dan of ginned cotton is enough for a spinning mill with 40,000 spindles to spin for a year. Exchanging it for wheat would yield 1.36 million shi; at an average consumption of three shi of wheat per person per year, it could feed 450,000 people for a year.

In-depth Investigation

This serious problem has attracted attention from all sides. From October to December of last year, the Northwest Region and the Shaanxi Provincial agricultural departments conducted typical investigations and held forums with some cadres and model laborers in the irrigation area to preliminarily study the causes of production reduction and suggestions for improvement. In early January of this year, in order to thoroughly understand the reasons for the decline in cotton production in the Jinghui Canal irrigation area in recent years, to restore and increase cotton production in this area, and to gain experience from here to guide other irrigated cotton areas across the country, the Central Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Water Resources dispatched more than ten professional cadres to conduct detailed investigations and studies in this area. Cadres from the agricultural and water conservancy departments of Hebei, Shanxi, and Henan provinces were also invited to participate in order to exchange experiences. During the investigation, Comrade Antonov, a Soviet expert, was invited to provide guidance, and Comrade Antonov also introduced the advanced experience and scientific theories of cotton cultivation and cotton field irrigation in the Soviet Union to everyone.

Reasons for Production Reduction

The investigation team believes that although natural disasters have had a certain impact on production reduction, they have not been decisive; the main reasons for production reduction are poor cultivation and irrigation techniques and extensive field management.

According to the feedback from the majority of local farmers: the land after irrigation in recent years has "become shady and hard," especially in the lower reaches of the irrigation ditches, where the viscosity has increased even more. Farmers say: "One ox can plow two mu of dry land in half a day, but only one and a half mu of land in the upper reaches of irrigation ditches, and one and two-tenths or three-tenths of a mu of land in the lower reaches." In such soil, water infiltrates slowly and evaporates quickly after irrigation; the surface becomes slurry immediately after irrigation, and then a very thick hard crust forms after evaporation. The groundwater level has also generally risen, generally by three to ten meters. Therefore, alkali has formed in the lower-lying areas. The area of alkaline land in the entire irrigation area has reached more than 20,000 mu. The reasons for the deterioration of the soil are: (1) Continuous cropping for many years without paying attention to crop rotation. Many fields have been continuously planted with cotton for seven or eight years, or even more than ten years. One cotton field in Shao Village, Yongle District, Jingyang County, has been continuously cropped for more than thirty years. The result of continuously planting cotton on the same piece of land is that the components in the soil that are beneficial to cotton growth gradually decrease, the opportunities to restore soil aggregates decrease, and the fertility of the soil decreases. Even with careful management and increased fertilization on such land that has been continuously cropped for many years, it is difficult to increase production. (2) Not paying attention to accumulating and applying fertilizer. After dry land is converted into paddy fields, fertilization must be improved. However, for many years, this area has still been applying fertilizer according to the amount used for dry land in the past, which has resulted in only consumption and no increase in organic matter in the soil. Farmers in this area do not use artemisia stems and green grass to pad pigsties or compost manure, raise few pigs, and do not dig pits in toilets, which greatly affects the quality of fertilizer. (3) Long-term use of large-ditch flooding irrigation methods leads to nutrient loss, soil structure damage, surface soil compaction, rising groundwater levels, and alkali formation on the ground in low-lying areas. (4) Not paying attention to plowing, harrowing, and moisture conservation techniques. The masses generally have the idea of ​​relying on canal water: "What's the use of conserving moisture when a large amount of water passes the door," the autumn plowing is very shallow, and they do not pay attention to spring harrowing and moisture conservation work and mid-tillage loosening of the soil.

The cotton field management work in this area is also very extensive. Before liberation, no attention was paid to management techniques. At that time, because the years since conversion to irrigated land were few, and because cotton prices were not guaranteed and the cotton field area was small, some farmers still practiced crop rotation, so they could still obtain general yields. Although cotton planting techniques have improved since liberation, they have not been improved in response to the special shortcomings caused by soil deterioration and the tendency for old seedlings to develop while small seedlings do not. This is mainly manifested in late sowing (mostly on April 25, or even as late as early May), untimely irrigation during the growth and thinning periods (the first watering is often not done until early July), and untrimmed or poorly trimmed branches. Last year, chemical fertilizers and soybean cakes and other nitrogen fertilizers were applied as top dressing in late July to early August, and the slightly more rain in the later period promoted excessive growth, causing bud shedding, boll shedding, and late maturity.

Certain diseases and insects are bound to occur on certain crops. If crop rotation is implemented, diseases and insects will naturally decrease. Due to continuous cropping of cotton fields in this area for many years, the disasters of diseases and insects have increased year by year. In addition, the prevention and control work was not carried out in a timely and thorough manner. In 1951, it suffered from pests such as aphids and spider mites in the early stage. In 1952, it suffered from pests such as pink bollworms and cotton bollworms in the later stage. Verticillium wilt occurred widely in continuously cropped cotton fields. In addition, the uneven rainfall made the cotton excessively grow, mature late, shed buds, and shed bolls.

Shortcomings of Leadership

In recent years, when local leading cadres talked about the reasons for the decline in cotton production, they always looked for them in various natural disasters. They said that if there were no insect pests and the rainfall was not excessive, production could be increased. Facts have proved that this is not the case. Under the same natural conditions, some cotton farmers in the area still obtained higher yields. For example, Jia Jinshou, a cotton farmer in Baiyang Village, Jingyang County, implemented a series of measures such as crop rotation, deep plowing, applying more organic fertilizer, early sowing, meticulous trimming, reasonable irrigation, and thorough pest control. In 1952, he averaged 103 jin of ginned cotton per mu on five mu and seven fen of cotton fields. There were also individual mutual aid groups and farmers who obtained an average yield of 170-180 jin of ginned cotton per mu last year.

In the past, the leadership did not conduct in-depth scientific investigations and analysis of the reasons for the decline in cotton production in the Jinghui Canal irrigation area. In 1951, the Central Ministry of Agriculture, the Northwest Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, and the Shaanxi Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry sent cadres to investigate the cotton production reduction problem in this area; however, that time, they only looked at the problem from the surface phenomena and believed that the main reasons for the production reduction were "untimely pest control" and "overlapping irrigation and rainfall." Few improvement suggestions were put forward, and they were not specific.

The local governments at all levels also made general calls for action with little specific guidance in leading production work. At the beginning of each agricultural season, they would carry out propaganda and mobilization, but they neither conducted in-depth and careful investigations and studies, nor did they solve any practical problems in production for the masses. For example, they call for raising pigs and accumulating fertilizer every year, but they rarely help the masses overcome the difficulties encountered in raising pigs, and they also rarely carry out specific organizational work; therefore, there is no significant effect. In terms of pest control, they also issue general calls every year, but they do not do enough in terms of medicine and equipment preparation and technology dissemination, so they have not formed mass action, and the effect is not great.

The agricultural and water conservancy technicians in the Jinghui Canal irrigation area have also not done enough practical experimental research on the reasons for the decline in cotton production in the area in the past. Local state-owned farms, especially the Jinghui Farm, only did some breeding work and general experimental work, and did not conduct specific experimental research on the decline in cotton production in the irrigation area, so they played a very small role in local cotton production. The coordination between local water conservancy work and agricultural work is also not very close. For example, the water conservancy department should have taken the initiative to determine the specific methods for watering time and water distribution based on the water demand of crops in each growing season and the soil moisture content at that time, but they did not do so. Winter irrigation has not been widely promoted either.

Improvement Methods

From the above facts, it seems that the main reason for the annual decline in production in the Jinghui Canal irrigation area in recent years is insufficient subjective effort and errors in leadership and technical guidance. As long as improvements are made in response to the local situation, it is possible to restore the past highest yields and continue to improve them. The investigation team believes that in the future, it is necessary to persuade the masses to actively improve in the following aspects:

(1) Improve the soil and restore and increase soil fertility.

1.  Implement reasonable crop rotation and focus on promoting rotation. In the future, continuous cotton cropping should not exceed three years, and the number of mu planted with cotton per household should not exceed 60% of the total cultivated land area of the entire household (those whose number of mu planted with cotton has not reached 60% should not increase it either), in order to allow for crop rotation. Starting this year, we should vigorously promote the crop rotation system; we can advocate the following six-year crop rotation method: Cotton (3 years) → Replanted peas or barley-pea mixed planting → Wheat (2 years) → Corn or beans → Cotton. In agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups with better conditions, we should focus on promoting pasture (alfalfa) rotation; we can advocate the following eight-year rotation: Cotton (3 years) → Alfalfa (3 years, the first year is wheat-alfalfa mixed planting) → Wheat (2 years), replanted corn → Cotton. (Alfalfa is a leguminous plant with root nodules that can increase nitrogen fertilizer in the soil. Its roots grow very deep and can absorb nutrients from deep soil layers, and it can leave a large number of residual roots in the ground after harvesting, increasing organic matter in the soil and making the soil fertile.)

2.  Carry out a manure accumulation and composting movement, increase the application of organic base fertilizer, and apply top dressing reasonably. We should organize coal to be sent to the countryside, and use the artemisia stalks, green grass, etc., that the local people originally used as fuel to pad pigsties. The method of composting manure should also be improved. Each county should strive to mobilize 50% of the farmers in the county to raise pigs, repair pens, and accumulate fertilizer within two to three years. Each household should set up toilets to accumulate human manure and urine. It is recommended to feed livestock with beans and oil residue, and then use livestock manure as fertilizer, rather than using these things directly as fertilizer. It is recommended to apply base fertilizer early in conjunction with autumn deep plowing or spring plowing; guide farmers to apply chemical fertilizer reasonably, and the time for applying chemical fertilizer should not be later than July 10.

3.  Carry out autumn deep plowing and early spring shallow plowing in a timely manner. The general requirement for autumn plowing is a depth of five to seven inches, and the plowing should be left rough for the winter. When the ground thaws in early spring, shallow plowing (three to four inches, without turning the soil, only loosening the soil) should be carried out immediately, and harrowing should be carried out immediately after plowing. Harrowing should also be carried out after each rain to conserve moisture.

4.  Improve saline-alkali land. For land that has already become alkaline, drainage ditches should be opened to lower the groundwater level. During the period of minimum evaporation in winter, flooding irrigation should be carried out to wash away alkali, and other methods should be used to improve the soil. For saline-alkali land, irrigation should temporarily be mainly small-ditch irrigation.

(2) Improve irrigation technology.

1.  Improvement of the irrigation period: Strive to achieve winter irrigation of all cotton fields within two to three years to store water and conserve moisture, and strive not to irrigate in spring to maintain soil temperature and advance sowing. If there is too little spring rain and the soil moisture is insufficient, it is best to complete spring irrigation before the end of March to avoid delaying the cotton sowing period. In order to promote the early development of cotton seedlings, the first irrigation of cotton during the growing season should begin before June 20 and be completed by the end of June; the second irrigation should be carried out in early July.

2.  Improvement of irrigation methods: The ditch irrigation method should continue to be promoted and improved. The width, depth, and length of the ditches should be as reasonable as possible, not too narrow, too shallow, or too long; the water volume should not be too large, and the water surface should be 5 cm from the top of the ditch. After irrigation, carry out mid-tillage in a timely manner to prevent soil compaction.

3.  Improvement of the water distribution system: The irrigation period and water volume should be determined based on the water demand of crops in each growing season and the soil moisture content at that time, and a precise water rotation schedule should be developed. We should also maintain close contact with meteorological agencies and gradually improve weather forecasting to guide irrigation.

(3) Improve sowing, promote early seedling development, and promote early maturity; in terms of variety selection, implement field plant selection and indoor seed selection. It is recommended to expose cotton seeds to the sun for four to five days within ten days before sowing, and implement the "three openings to one cooling" method of scalding seeds to promote germination. Farms and technical guidance stations should grasp the soil temperature (sowing can be done when the soil temperature is 12 degrees Celsius), and sowing should be completed between April 15 and 25 (around Guyu), and should not be delayed. Two or three days after the seedlings have fully emerged, thin the seedlings by hand. Carry out secondary thinning when one or two true leaves emerge, and complete the final thinning before harvesting wheat. Generally, a row spacing of 1.8 to 2 feet and a plant spacing of 7.5 to 8 inches are required, and more than 4,000 seedlings per mu should be maintained. Inter-row cultivation should be carried out during the first thinning.

(4) Meticulous trimming. We should learn trimming techniques from other regions. Strive to fully implement leaf removal this year and pay attention to heading the main stem.

(5) Vigorously prevent and control diseases and insect pests. In the future, in accordance with the spirit of "prevention is more important than treatment," we should fully prepare medicines and equipment, vigorously organize the masses to carry out prevention and control, and implement it throughout the year.

(6) Strengthen scientific experimental research on soil, tillage and moisture conservation, water demand of various crops, river water sediment content, etc.

These methods must be widely mastered and effectively implemented by the masses in order to achieve practical results. The county committees of the Communist Party of China and the county people's governments of the local counties should study and formulate specific implementation plans based on the improvement suggestions put forward by the investigation team. For some of the incorrect ideas and practices existing among the local masses, we must use methods such as comparing good and bad examples to persuade and educate them, so that they can recognize the evil consequences of these practices. Generally speaking, labor is relatively scarce in the Jinghui Canal cotton production area, and each male full laborer has to bear about ten mu of cotton fields. In order to effectively promote advanced technology, it is also necessary to promote the mutual aid and cooperation movement and more widely mobilize women to participate in agricultural production.

    不良的耕作技术把好棉田变成了坏棉田
    ——陕西省泾惠渠灌溉区棉花减产的原因
    编者按：这篇文章是根据中央农业部、水利部，西北农林部、水利部，陕西省农林厅、水利局及其他有关机关组成的“陕西省泾惠渠灌溉区棉花减产考察组”的考察报告和“群众日报”对于这个问题的报道编写成的。从这篇文章里，可以看到不懂技术和领导作风的一般化，会给国家和人民造成多么巨大的损失。这不只是所有灌溉棉田地区的领导干部应当密切注意的，也是全国各地所有做农村工作的干部都应当引为警惕的。
    巨大的损失
    泾惠渠灌溉区范围内的泾阳、三原、高陵、临潼四县，是陕西省的主要产棉地区。这一带的棉花的单位面积产量，十几年间都是相当高的，一般年成每亩平均产皮棉七十斤左右。棉花的质量一般也很好，纤维长度平均都有一英寸，而且非常整齐。解放以后，当地农民经过了各种社会改革运动，开展了爱国丰产运动，生产热情是很高的；灌溉棉田面积到一九五二年增加到四十二万亩（过去在三十万亩左右）。可是，当地棉花的单位面积产量却一年比一年降低了。一九五○年平均每亩产皮棉五十多斤；一九五一年降低到四十斤；一九五二年更降低到二十五斤，比当地同年旱地棉花产量还要低。棉花质量也有下降的趋势。这对于国家、对于当地棉农都是巨大的损失。拿一九五二年做例子：每亩平均产皮棉二十五斤，比常年产量减产四十多斤。即使按每亩减产四十斤计算，四十二万亩灌溉棉田总共减产将近十七万担皮棉。十七万担皮棉，足够一个拥有四万纱锭的纱厂纺一年。拿它换麦子，可以换一百三十六万石；以每人每年平均吃三石麦子计算，可供四十五万人吃一年。
    深入的考察
    这个严重的问题引起了各方面的重视。去年十月到十二月，西北区和陕西省农业部门曾进行了典型调查，并在灌溉区召集一些干部和劳动模范开座谈会，初步研究了减产的原因和改进的意见。今年一月上旬，中央农业部和水利部为了彻底弄清楚泾惠渠灌溉区棉花近几年来减产的原因，恢复和提高这个地区的棉花产量，并从这里取得经验以指导全国其他灌溉棉区，曾派出专业干部十多人，在这个地区进行了细致的考察研究。还邀请了河北、山西、河南等省农业和水利部门的干部参加，以便交流经验。在调查时并且请苏联专家安东诺夫同志进行指导，安东诺夫同志并对大家介绍了苏联棉花栽培和棉田灌溉的先进经验和科学理论。减产的原因
    考察组认为，自然灾害对于减产虽然有一定的影响，但是并没有决定性的影响；减产的主要原因是耕作、灌溉技术不好和田间管理工作粗放。
    根据当地多数农民反映：这几年灌溉后的地“变阴变硬”了，特别是下水地（灌溉畦的下端），粘性更增加了。农民说：“一头牛一晌可耕二亩旱地，只能耕一亩半上水地，一亩二、三分下水地。”这样的土壤，灌了水渗透慢、蒸发快；刚灌水以后地面成了泥浆，蒸发了以后地面就结成很厚的硬壳。地下水位也普遍上升，一般上升了三公尺到十公尺。因此，在地势较低的地方就泛了碱。全灌溉区泛碱土地的面积已有二万多亩。土壤变坏的原因是：（一）多年连作，不讲究倒茬轮作。连种棉花七、八年甚至十年以上的很多。泾阳县永乐区邵村有一块棉田竟连作了三十多年。在同一块土地上连续种植棉花的结果，使土壤中有利棉花生长的成分逐渐减少，也减少了恢复土壤团粒的机会，减少了土壤的肥沃度。在这样多年连作的土地上，即使进行精细管理和增施肥料，产量也很难提高。（二）不讲究积肥、施肥。旱地变成水田后，施肥必须改进。但这个地区多年来仍然按照过去种旱地的施肥量来施肥，因此使土壤中的有机质只有消耗，没有增加。这个地区的农民不用蒿秆青草垫圈、沤肥，养猪少，厕所不掘坑，大大地影响了肥料的质量。
    （三）长期用大畦漫灌的方法浇水，使养料流失，土壤结构破坏，表土板结，地下水位上升和低地地面泛碱。（四）不讲究耕耙保墒技术。群众普遍存在着“大水门前过，保墒干什么”的依靠渠水的思想，秋耕很浅，也不注意春天耙耱保墒工作和中耕松土。
    这个地区的棉花田间管理工作也很粗放，解放前向不注意管理技术。那时，因为改成灌溉地的年代较少，而且因为棉花价格没有保障，棉田面积较小，有些农民还实行倒槎，所以还能得到一般的产量。解放后植棉技术虽有提高，但没有针对由于土壤变坏、发老苗不发小苗的特殊缺点进行改进。这主要表现在播种晚（大部在四月二十五日，甚至迟到五月上旬始种），生长期、间苗期灌溉不适时（第一水多在七月初才放），整枝不普遍也不精细。去年在七月下旬到八月初才施用化学肥料和豆饼等氮素肥料作追肥，加以后期雨水稍多，便促成了疯长，引起落蕾、落铃和晚熟。
    一定的病虫是要在一定的作物上发生的，如果实行倒茬轮作，病虫自然就会减少。这个地区由于棉田多年连作，病虫灾害就逐年增加。加上防治工作进行得不及时和不彻底，在一九五一年前期就遭受了蚜虫、红蜘蛛等虫害，一九五二年后期遭受了红铃虫、棉铃虫等虫害，黄萎病在连作棉田里普遍发生。再加上雨水不调，就更使棉花徒长、晚熟、落蕾、落铃。
        领导的缺点
    几年来，当地的领导干部谈到棉花减产的原因，总是从各种自然灾害方面去找。他们说，如果不闹虫害，雨水不过多，就可以增产。事实证明，并不是这样。在同样自然条件下，当地还是有一些棉农得到了较高的产量。像泾阳县白杨村棉农贾金寿，因为实行了倒茬、深耕、多施有机质肥料、播种较早、精细整枝、合理灌溉、彻底治虫等一系列的措施，一九五二年在五亩七分棉田上每亩平均产皮棉一百零三斤。还有个别互助组和农户，去年得到每亩平均一百七八十斤皮棉的产量。
    过去，领导方面对于泾惠渠灌溉区棉花减产的原因都没有深入地科学地调查分析过。一九五一年中央农业部、西北农林部、陕西省农林厅曾派出干部对这个地区的棉花减产问题进行了考察；但那一次只是从表面现象来看问题，认为减产的主要原因是
    “治虫不及时”和“灌溉和雨水重复了”。提出的改进意见很少，而且不具体。
    当地各级政府在领导生产工作中也是一般号召多，具体指导少。到了每个农事季节，他们就宣传动员一番，但既没有深入地细心地调查钻研，也就没有为群众解决生产中的任何实际问题。比如每年都号召养猪积肥，但却很少帮助群众克服养猪中碰到的困难，也很少进行具体的组织工作；因此，就没有显著的效果。在治虫方面，也是年年发一般的号召，而在药械准备、技术传授方面做得很不够，因此没有形成群众性的行动，效果不大。
    在泾惠渠灌溉区的农业、水利技术人员，在过去对于当地棉花减产的原因所作的试验研究工作也是不够实际的。当地国营农场，特别是泾惠农场，只做了一些育种的工作和一般性的试验工作，根本没有针对灌溉区棉花减产的情况进行具体的试验研究，因此对于当地的棉花生产所起的作用很小。当地水利工作和农业工作的配合也是很不密切的。比如，水利部门本来应当主动地根据各个季节作物的需水量和当时土壤的含水量，确定浇水时间和分配水量的具体办法，可是他们并没有这样做。冬灌也没有普遍地推行。
        改进的办法
    从以上这些事实看来，泾惠渠灌溉区近年来逐年减产的主要原因是主观努力不够，是领导方面、技术指导方面犯了错误，只要针对当地情况加以改进，是可能恢复过去的最高产量并且可以继续提高的。考察组认为，今后必须说服群众从以下各方面积极改进：
    （一）改良土壤，恢复并提高地力。
    一、实行合理倒槎，重点推行轮作。今后棉田连作不应超过三年，每家植棉亩数不应超过全家所有耕地面积的百分之六十（目前植棉亩数没有达到百分之六十的也不应增加），以便倒茬轮作。自今年起应大力推广倒茬制；可提倡这样的六年倒茬法：棉花（三年）→回槎豌豆或大麦豌豆混种→小麦
    （二年）→玉米或豆类→棉花。在条件较好的农业生产合作社和互助组应重点推行牧草（苜蓿）轮作制；可提倡这样的八年轮作：棉花（三年）→苜蓿
    （三年，第一年为小麦苜蓿混种）→小麦（二年），回茬玉米→棉花。（苜蓿是豆科植物，根部生有根瘤，能增加土壤中的氮肥。它的根生得很深，能把深土层的养分吸取上来，并且可以在收割后把大量残根留在地里，增加土壤中的有机质，使土壤肥沃。）
    二、开展积肥、沤粪运动，增施有机质基肥和合理施用追肥。应组织煤炭下乡，而把原来当地群众用作燃料的蒿秆、青草等垫圈，沤粪积肥方法也应当改善，各县应在二年到三年内做到发动全县百分之五十农户养猪修圈积肥。每户应设立厕所积蓄人粪尿。提倡用豆类、油渣喂牲口，然后用牲口粪作肥料，而不要把这些东西直接用作肥料。提倡结合秋季深耕或春耕，早施基肥；指导农民合理施用化学肥料，施用化学肥料的时间不应迟于七月十日。
    三、适时进行秋季深耕、早春浅耕。秋耕一般要求深度为五至七市寸，耕后立槎过冬。早春解冻时应即进行浅耕（三到四寸，不翻土，只松土），耕后应即耙、耱。每次雨后亦应进行耙、耱以求保墒。
    四、改良盐碱土地。已起碱的土地，应进行开沟排水，以降低地下水位。在冬季蒸发最少时期，应进行漫灌洗碱，并用其他方法进行土壤改良。盐碱地灌溉暂以小畦灌溉为主。
    （二）改进灌溉技术。
    一、灌溉时期的改进：争取在二、三年内达到全部棉田冬灌，蓄水保墒，争取春季不灌，以保持地温，提前播种。如春雨过少，地墒不足，必须春灌时，最好提前于三月底以前灌完，不误棉花播种期。为了促进棉苗提早发育，棉花生长期第一次灌水提前在六月二十日前开始，到六月底前轮完一遍；在七月初进行第二次灌溉。
    二、灌溉方法的改进：应继续推行沟灌法，并加以改进，沟的宽度、深度、长度要力求合理，不可太窄、太浅、太长；水量不可过大，水面距沟顶以五公分为合适。灌溉后，适时地进行中耕，以防地面板结。
    三、分水、配水制度的改进：应根据作物各生长季节的需水量及当时土壤的含水量，确定灌溉时期与水量，精密制订轮水表。还应和气象机关密切联系，逐渐做好气象预测工作，用以指导灌溉。
    （三）改进播种，提早幼苗发育，促进早熟；在选种方面，贯彻田间株选和室内粒选。提倡播种前十天以内把棉籽在阳光下曝晒四到五天，并实行“三开对一凉”的烫种催芽办法。农场及技术指导站应掌握地温（地温在摄氏十二度时即可播种），播种应在四月十五日到二十五日内完成（谷雨前后），不宜延迟。苗刚出齐后二、三日，用手间苗，出一、二个真叶时进行二次间苗，在收麦前完成定苗。一般要求行距一尺八寸到二尺，株距七寸五分到八寸，每亩保持全苗四千株以上。在第一次间苗时，即应进行行间中耕。
    （四）精细整枝。应学习其他地区的整枝技术。争取在今年全部实行去叶枝，并注意进行打群尖。
    （五）大力防治病虫灾害。今后应根据“防重于治”的精神，充分准备药械，大力组织群众进行防治，并贯彻全年。
    （六）加强关于土壤、整地保墒、各种作物需水量、河水含沙量等科学试验研究工作。
    这些办法必须使广大群众普遍掌握，切实实行，才能收到实际的效果。当地各县的中共县委和县人民政府，应当根据考察组所提出的改进意见，研究出具体的推行计划。对于当地群众中存在的一些错误思想和做法，要用好坏实例对比等办法进行说服教育，使他们认识这些做法的恶果。泾惠渠棉产区一般说来劳力是比较缺乏的，每个男全劳力平均要负担十亩左右的棉田。为了使先进技术有效地推广，还必须推进互助合作运动，并更广泛地发动妇女参加农业生产。
