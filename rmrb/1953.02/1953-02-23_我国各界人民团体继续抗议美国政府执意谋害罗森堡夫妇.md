Xinhua News Agency, February 22nd: Various people's organizations in China continue to express their protest against the U.S. government's insistence on murdering the Rosenbergs. The All-China Federation of Scientific Societies issued a statement saying: All Chinese scientific workers are extremely angry that Eisenhower, disregarding the protests of people from all countries, has refused to revoke the unreasonable judgment against the Rosenbergs. This criminal act by the U.S. government of murdering kind-hearted scientific workers demonstrates that the U.S. rulers are the culprits who strangle justice and strangle scientific culture.

The Preparatory Committee of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce also issued a statement protesting Eisenhower's decision to execute the Rosenbergs. The statement said: No sooner had Eisenhower taken office than he brazenly rejected the Rosenbergs' request to revoke the unreasonable judgment, disregarding the just protests of the people of the United States and other countries around the world. This decision is obviously a complete violation of human justice and conscience. It exposes that Eisenhower and the small reactionary clique he represents are increasingly embarking on the road of fascist bloody rule, and it will inevitably be severely condemned by peace-loving people all over the world.

    我国各界人民团体继续抗议美国政府执意谋害罗森堡夫妇
    【新华社二十二日讯】我国各界人民团体继续就美国政府执意谋害罗森堡夫妇的事件表示抗议。中华全国自然科学专门学会联合会发表声明说：全中国的科学工作者对于艾森豪威尔不顾各国人民的抗议，拒绝撤销对罗森堡夫妇的无理判决，感到极大愤怒。美国政府这种谋杀善良的科学工作者的罪恶行为，说明了美国统治者是扼杀正义、扼杀科学文化的罪魁。
    中华全国工商业联合会筹备委员会也发表声明，抗议艾森豪威尔决定处死罗森堡夫妇。声明说：艾森豪威尔一上台，竟不顾美国及世界各国人民正义的抗议，悍然拒绝罗森堡夫妇要求撤销无理判决的请求。这个决定显然是完全违反人类正义和良心的。这暴露出艾森豪威尔与其所代表的美国一小撮反动集团越来越走上法西斯的血腥统治的道路，它必将受到全世界爱好和平的人民严正的谴责。
