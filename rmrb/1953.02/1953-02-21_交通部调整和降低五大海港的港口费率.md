Xinhua News Agency, February 20th: The Ministry of Transportation of the Central People's Government, in order to promote the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas and foreign trade, has decided to comprehensively adjust and lower port fees for the five major seaports of Dalian, Tianjin, Qingdao, Shanghai, and Guangzhou, effective February 21st. In this adjustment, a total of twenty-eight port fee items will be cancelled and seventeen will be merged. The average reduction of all port fees is 45 percent, and the calculation methods for port fees in each port will be unified. At the same time, the Haihe River Project Beneficiary Fee, the Pearl River Water Conservancy Project Beneficiary Fee, and the Shanghai Port Dredging Fee will be abolished. In addition, port dues will be collected from both cargo owners and ships to provide funds for routine port maintenance. In terms of loading and unloading fees, except for Shanghai Port, all ports will eliminate night work surcharges and extra distance and height surcharges from the 21st onwards.

During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, China's seaports were divided and occupied by imperialists. They used various pretexts to extort and plunder the people. According to investigations, on the eve of liberation, the port with the most fee items had more than 170. After liberation, the People's Government simplified and reduced these several times. After this adjustment, the port fees have been reduced to six categories: pilotage fees, port dues, loading and unloading fees, berthing fees, storage fees, and service usage fees. Among these, service usage fees are only charged when cargo owners or ships need to apply for them, so the basic fee categories have been simplified to five. Port fees have also been greatly reduced.

    交通部调整和降低五大海港的港口费率
    【新华社二十日讯】中央人民政府交通部为了促进城乡物资交流和对外贸易，决定自二月二十一日起全面调整和降低大连、天津、青岛、上海、广州五大海港的港口费率。在这次调整中，共要取消二十八种和合并十七种港口费目，全部港口费率平均降低百分之四十五，并统一各港港口费率的计算方法。同时并取消海河工程受益费，珠江水利工程受益费和上海港的浚浦费，另外向货主和船舶双方征收港务费，供给经常的港务维护费用。在装卸费中，除上海港外，各港自二十一日起取消夜工加成费和加远、加高费等。
    在国民党反动统治时期，我国的海港被帝国主义分割窃据。他们用各种名目向人民敲榨勒索。据调查在解放前夕各港口费目，最多的有一百七十余种。解放后人民政府曾几次简化减少。经这次调整以后，港口的费目，已减为引水费、港务费、装卸费、停泊费、堆存费和服务使用费等六种，其中服务使用费只有当货主或船舶有需要申请时才收取，因此基本费目已简化为五种。港口费率也大大降低。
