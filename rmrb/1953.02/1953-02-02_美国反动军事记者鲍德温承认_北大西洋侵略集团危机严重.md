American reactionary military journalist Baldwin admits
The North Atlantic aggressive bloc is in serious crisis

[Xinhua News Agency dispatch] American well-known reactionary military journalist Baldwin published an article in the "New York Times" on January 12, admitting that the North Atlantic aggressive bloc is in serious crisis. Baldwin recently investigated Western European countries for three months. In the article he wrote after returning to the country, he said: "When General Eisenhower took office as President, the crisis of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization was one of the major problems first encountered by the Eisenhower administration. This crisis must be dealt with head-on, otherwise this crisis will become increasingly acute."

Baldwin pointed out that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization has already "malfunctioned" and "cracks have appeared between the allies." Due to France's fears and internal disagreements within West Germany, the core plan of the United States' preparations for war in Western Europe - the plan to arm West Germany - "has been stalled midway." He said: "There is no hope now of quickly ratifying the European Army Treaty that allows West Germany to rearm, and many military authorities believe that the European Army currently being planned is technically unworkable."

At the same time, Baldwin acknowledged that the serious economic crisis in Western European countries has made them unable to accelerate their arms expansion. Not only is it problematic for Western European countries to accelerate their arms expansion, but Baldwin also believes that "if several European countries do not continue to receive external assistance, or their domestic economic situation is not rapidly improved, they will not be economically and technically able to maintain their existing military strength." Baldwin pointed out that the issue of relying on US aid to carry out Western European arms expansion is very "difficult" and "complicated." He did not explain what this "difficulty" is, but people know that this "difficulty" lies in the fact that the United States' own strength is also stretched and unable to provide such "indefinite" "assistance" to Western Europe.

Baldwin said: From the current point of view, the crisis of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is also a "crisis of long-term failure."

    美国反动军事记者鲍德温承认
    北大西洋侵略集团危机严重
    【新华社讯】美国有名的反动军事记者鲍德温一月十二日在“纽约时报”发表一篇文章，承认北大西洋侵略集团危机严重。鲍德温最近曾到西欧各国调查了三个月，他在返国后写的这篇文章中说：“当艾森豪威尔将军就任总统的时候，北大西洋公约组织的危机是艾森豪威尔政府首先遭遇到的主要问题之一。必须迎头处理这个危机，否则这个危机将日益尖锐化。”
    鲍德温指出，北大西洋公约组织已经“发生故障”，“在盟国之间，出现了裂缝”。由于法国的恐惧以及西德内部的意见分歧，美国在西欧备战的核心计划——武装西德的计划“已在中途受到了阻滞”。他说：“现在没有希望很快地批准允许西德重新武装的欧洲军条约，而且许多军事方面的权威人士都相信，目前在计划中的欧洲军在技术上是行不通的。”
    同时，鲍德温承认西欧各国严重的经济危机已使它们无力加速扩军。不仅是西欧各国要加速扩军成问题，鲍德温并且认为，“欧洲若干国家如果不继续获得外来的援助，或者国内经济情况不予迅速的改善，它们在经济上和技术上都将不能把现在已有的军事力量维持下去。”鲍德温指出，要依靠美国援助来进行西欧备战的问题是很“困难”和“复杂”的。他没有说明这种“困难”是什么，但是人们知道，这种“困难”就在于美国自己的力量也是捉襟见肘的，无力对西欧提供这样“无限期”的“援助”。
    鲍德温说：从目前看来，北大西洋公约组织的危机也是“长期失败的危机”。
