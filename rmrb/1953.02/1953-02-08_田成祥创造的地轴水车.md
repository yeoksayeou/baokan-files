    Tian Chengxiang Creates Ground Shaft Waterwheel
    Gao Rushan
    Tian Chengxiang, a small copper craftsman from Caojiabao Village, Pingyao County, Shanxi Province, modified a Liberation-style waterwheel into a ground shaft waterwheel during last year's patriotic production increase campaign, after more than a month of painstaking research. Using this type of waterwheel to draw water from the riverbank can fully maximize irrigation efficiency, increasing the irrigated area by more than two times.
    Caojiabao Village is located along the Fen River. Previously, the farmers here used a dipper on a pole to draw water from the Fen River for irrigation, requiring three people to pass the dipper, and could only irrigate one mu of land per day. During last year's drought resistance and production increase campaign, the village's water conservancy representative Du Bingsheng, water conservancy director Meng Shengao, and others took the lead in organizing ten households to jointly purchase two Liberation-style waterwheels and install them on river-penetrating wells for irrigation. The water level of the river-penetrating wells was only five meters from the ground, making it easy for livestock to pull, but the water output efficiency of the waterwheel was low, and it still couldn't irrigate even two mu of land per day. Seeing this situation, Tian Chengxiang began to study the work of modifying the waterwheel. He first changed the single-pipe water lifting of the Liberation-style waterwheel to double-pipe water lifting, doubling the irrigation area. Although using this modified waterwheel could expand the irrigation area, it did not solve the difficulty for the masses in digging river-penetrating wells. Digging a river-penetrating well here required about two hundred labor days, and even more labor was required when encountering sand layers, with the risk of failure. Even if it was successful, the diversion canal and well platform could be washed away during a flood. In order to overcome this difficulty, Tian Chengxiang further researched and finally came up with a method of using the rotation of a ground shaft to make the water pipe directly extend into the river to lift water. He told the village cadres and the masses about this method, and immediately received encouragement and support from the cadres and the masses. Village Chairman Liu Jinshan, Communist Youth League Branch Secretary Tian Chengliang, Water Conservancy Director Meng Shengao, Water Conservancy Representative Du Bingsheng, and others actively helped him solve the difficulty of lacking funds when trial-producing the waterwheel. In this way, the first successfully modified ground shaft waterwheel was installed on the Fen River on June 15th last year, and the effect was very good after testing. Due to the action of the reduction gear, the water output of this modified waterwheel greatly increased, and it could irrigate seven or eight mu of garden land or more than five mu of dry land per day, increasing the irrigated area by more than two times compared with the original waterwheel. Now six such waterwheels have been installed in Caojiabao Village, Pingyao County, and nineteen more have been installed in other villages along the river. The Shanxi Provincial People's Government attaches great importance to this type of waterwheel and has issued a notice throughout the province, requiring areas with suitable conditions to imitate and adopt it. At the same time, a bonus of 5 million yuan was issued to Tian Chengxiang as a reward.
    The materials required to modify the ground shaft waterwheel are a ground shaft 12 to 14 feet long and 1.5 inches thick, a pair of reduction spur gears, two sets of 1.2-inch ball bearings, a copper or alloy bearing bush, and screws, wood, etc. According to local prices, the modification cost of the mechanical part of each waterwheel is about 1 million yuan. The modification method is: remove the sprocket of the Liberation-style waterwheel and replace it with a large spur gear, the large gear is in contact with the small spur gear installed at one end of the ground shaft, and the other end of the ground shaft is equipped with the original sprocket of the waterwheel. Near both ends of the ground shaft, use two sets of ball bearings to fix it on the wooden frame, and add a bearing bush in the middle (the ground shaft waterwheels in Pingyao County now do not have this bearing bush, and the ground shaft vibrates severely when rotating). Install the sprocket, water scoop, and water pipe on the wooden bracket on the riverbank, and the frame of the Liberation-style waterwheel is placed in the middle of the earth platform (the same as the well platform), and the ground shaft rotates in the dark ditch of the earth platform (built with bricks, covered with wooden boards and soil), the center distance of the two gear shafts (that is, the center distance of the waterwheel horizontal shaft and the ground shaft) is 8 inches, and the size ratio of the gears can be adjusted according to the water lifting height. If the water lifting height is about 30 feet, use two spur gears with equal diameters, that is, the speed remains unchanged; if the water lifting height is about 15 feet, use two spur gears with a diameter difference of one time, that is, a two-to-one gear ratio is obtained; if the water lifting height is about 10 feet, use two spur gears with a diameter difference of two times, that is, a three-to-one gear ratio is obtained; in this way, animal power can be fully utilized to increase the water output. Both ends and the middle of the ground shaft must be processed to be smooth where the bearing bushes are installed.
    The structure of the ground shaft waterwheel created by Tian Chengxiang is completely in line with scientific principles. This creation not only overcomes the difficulty of digging river-penetrating wells, but also expands the application range of waterwheels from drawing groundwater from wells to drawing surface water, greatly expanding the area where waterwheels can be used. More importantly, it is possible to increase the water output by using the gear speed change according to the different water levels, fully exerting the efficiency of animal power and waterwheels.
    In areas along rivers and lakes where natural rivers cannot be used for irrigation, where there are no other more advanced water lifting tools, and the water lifting height does not exceed 30 feet, this type of waterwheel can be imitated and adopted. The following points must be paid attention to when using this type of waterwheel: 1. The wooden frame should be strong and moisture-resistant, otherwise it will be deformed, affecting the straightness of the axis. 2. The earth platform should not be too small, and the drawbar should not be shorter than five feet to reduce the pulling force of the livestock. 3. The speed of the gears should not exceed the range introduced in the previous section to adapt to the traction force of the livestock. 4. If the river water rises sharply and the water flow is too fast, the water pipe should be removed to prevent the water pipe from being bent; if the river water may erode the river bank, the waterwheel should be moved inward. 5. When the water output speed increases, the original water scoop should be raised by a few inches to prevent the water from overflowing. (Attached picture)

    田成祥创造的地轴水车
    高如山
    山西平遥县曹家堡村小炉铜匠田成祥在去年爱国增产竞赛运动中，经过一个多月的苦心钻研，把解放式水车改装为地轴水车。用这种水车在河岸上汲取河水，能充分发挥灌溉的效能，把浇地面积增加两倍多。
    曹家堡村位于汾河沿岸。以前，这里的农民都是用吊杆斗子从汾河中汲水浇地，一个斗子需要三个人递传，一天只能浇一亩地。在去年的抗旱增产运动中，该村水利代表杜炳生、水利主任孟胜鳌等带头组织了十户农民伙买了两部解放式水车，安装在透河井上浇地。透河井的水位离地面只有五公尺，牲口拉着轻，水车出水效率低，每天还浇不到二亩地。田成祥看到这种情况，就开始研究改造水车的工作。他首先把解放式水车的单管提水改为双管提水，使浇地面积扩大了一倍。应用这种改装的水车虽然能扩大浇地面积，但是还没有解决群众打透河井的困难问题。这里打一个透河井约需二百个工，遇到沙层费工更大，而且有打不成的危险；即便打成了，洪水一涨，引水渠及井台也有被冲坏的可能。田成祥为了克服这一困难，又进一步作了研究，终于想出了利用地轴转动使水管直接伸入河内提水的办法。他把这个办法告诉村里的干部和群众，当即受到干部和群众的鼓励与支持。村主席刘金山、团支部书记田成亮、水利主任孟胜鳌、水利代表杜炳生等积极地帮助他解决试制水车时缺乏资金的困难。这样，第一部改装成功的地轴水车在去年六月十五日就安装在汾河边上，经过试验，效果很好。这种改装过的水车，由于变速齿轮的作用，出水量大大增加，每天可浇园地七、八亩或旱地五亩多，比用原来水车，增加浇地面积两倍多。现在平遥县曹家堡村已安装了六部这样的水车，其他沿河村庄也安装了十九部。山西省人民政府对这种水车很重视，已通报全省，要求有条件的地区仿效采用。同时还发给田成祥五十万元奖金，予以奖励。
    改装地轴水车需用材料为长十二至十四呎，粗一吋半的地轴一根，变速正齿轮一对，一吋二分的滚珠轴承二套，铜或合金的轴瓦一个和螺丝、木料等一部。根据当地物价计算，每部水车机械部分的改装费用，约需一百万元。改装办法是：把解放式水车的链轮卸下，换上一个大的正齿轮，大齿轮的下面和装在地轴一端的小正齿轮相接触，地轴的另一端则装上水车原来的链轮。在靠近地轴两端的地方，用滚珠轴承两套把它固定在木架上，中间加安一个轴瓦（现在平遥县的地轴水车都没有这种轴瓦，转动时地轴颤动很厉害）。把链轮、水簸箕及水管安装在河边的木支架上，解放式水车的机架安放在土台（和井台一样）中间，地轴在土台的暗沟内（用砖砌的，上面盖木板覆土）旋转，两个齿轮轴中心距离（即水车横轴与地轴的中心距离）为八吋，齿轮的大小比例可根据提水高度来调节。如提水高度为三十呎左右，用两个直径相等的正齿轮，即不变其转速；如提水高度在十五呎左右，用两个直径相差一倍的正齿轮，即获得二比一的变速；如提水高度在十呎左右，用两个直径相差二倍的正齿轮，即获得三比一的变速；这样，就可以充分利用畜力来增加出水量。地轴的两端及中间装轴瓦部位必须加工，全部车光。
    田成祥所创造的地轴水车的构造是完全合乎科学原理的。这一创造，不但克服了打透河井的困难，并且把水车的应用范围从打井汲取地下水发展到汲取地面水，使可以利用水车的地域大为扩展。更重要的是，能够根据水位高低的不同，利用齿轮的变速增加出水量，充分发挥了畜力和水车应有的效能。
    在不能应用自然河流灌溉，在没有其他更为进步的提水工具，提水高度不超过三十呎的沿河、湖地区，都可以仿效采用这种水车。在应用这种水车时必须注意以下几点：一、木架要坚固耐潮，否则会发生变形，影响轴线的平直。二、土台不能太小，拉杆不要短于五尺，以减轻牲口的拉力。三、齿轮的转速不要超过前节介绍的范围，以适应牲口的牵引力。四、如河水大涨，水流过急时，要把水管卸下，以免水管被冲弯曲；如河水有淘涮河岸的可能时，应把水车内移。五、出水速度加快时，应把原有的水簸箕加高几寸，以免水流溢出。（附图片）
