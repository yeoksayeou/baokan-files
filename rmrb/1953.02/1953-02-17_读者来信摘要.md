Editor's Note: Recently, we have received some readers' letters criticizing some cadres for their many wrong attitudes towards the Marriage Law. Some harbor serious feudal ideas, unwilling to accept the Marriage Law; some dare not publicize the Marriage Law; and some even deliberately distort the Marriage Law. This is a noteworthy problem. Facts have proven that enabling cadres to correctly understand the Marriage Law is one of the key factors in implementing it; if the Marriage Law cannot be correctly implemented among cadres, it is impossible to implement it among the masses. Now, we are publishing three letters from readers Guo Qian and others below, and we suggest that local Party committees and people's governments, during the publicity campaign month for implementing the Marriage Law, should first conduct systematic ideological education among cadres, and conduct specific analysis through typical examples, so that everyone can truly realize the superiority of the New Democratic marriage system ideologically, correct their wrong ideas, and lay a good foundation for further implementation of the Marriage Law.

	Correcting Cadres' Feudal Ideas is the Key to Implementing the Marriage Law
	Many Cadres in GuiSui City have Feudal Ideas on Marriage Issues
	Guo Qian's letter: Recently, the GuiSui Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China investigated the understanding of the Marriage Law among cadres in municipal-level organs, and found that the feudal ideas of cadres are still very serious.
	Some cadres still have serious ideas of male superiority and female inferiority. They believe that "officials rely on seals, tigers rely on mountains, and women cannot be separated from men"; they believe that improving the status of women will cause "yin to flourish and yang to decline, and cows to walk faster than horses," a phenomenon that is "abnormal." Many cadres beat and scold their wives.
	Many cadres do not have a sufficient understanding of the importance of implementing the Marriage Law, and therefore are indifferent to the work of publicizing and implementing the Marriage Law. Older cadres said: "I am old, and I will neither divorce nor marry in the future, the Marriage Law has nothing to do with me." General cadres also believe that implementing the Marriage Law is a matter for the Women's Federation and the court, so they allow feudal ideas to spread everywhere without exposing or criticizing them.
	It is especially worth noting that cadres of the GuiSui Municipal People's Court also lack a correct understanding of the Marriage Law. Among the thirty-eight cadres of the court who participated in the Marriage Law test, none of them answered the question "What is the New Democratic Marriage System" correctly; among the thirty-six cadres who participated in the ideological examination, thirty-three were against free love.
	This situation in GuiSui City is worthy of attention by all regions; the investigation method in GuiSui City is also worthy of reference by all regions.
	Many Cadres in Shou County, Anhui Province, Distort the Marriage Law as "Divorce Law"
	Tang Daonong's letter: Many cadres in Shou County, Anhui Province, distort the Marriage Law as the "Divorce Law." A cadre of the Shou County People's Court said to the masses when publicizing the Marriage Law: "I am here to support those who want to get a divorce; whoever wants to get a divorce should prepare the conditions." Cadres in two villages in JiangGuai Township, ShuangQiao District, even challenged each other to see which village had more divorces, considering it a sign of good implementation of the Marriage Law. In one group of 53 households in ShunNan Township, SanHe District, 13 couples divorced last year. Some couples who had always had good feelings divorced because of a momentary quarrel, and the district government approved the divorce. In addition, some cadres believe that publicizing the Marriage Law will cause "chaos in the world," so they dare not publicize it. The Shou County People's Government should pay attention to this issue, earnestly organize cadres at all levels to study the Marriage Law, reverse the cadres' wrong understanding, and correctly implement the Marriage Law.
	Some Rural Cadres in MinHou Special District, Fujian, Have Many Concerns about Publicizing the Marriage Law
	Zhang Bo's letter: Some rural cadres and propagandists in MinHou Special District, Fujian, still have many concerns about publicizing the Marriage Law: First, village cadres and propagandists who are not yet married are afraid that others will say they are looking for a spouse for themselves. Indeed, some ideologically backward peasants have ridiculed them in this way. Second, they are afraid of making mistakes in publicity and violating the law. A propagandist in LuoYuan County once said to me: "If you say something wrong about publicizing the Marriage Law, people will die, and you can't bear this responsibility." Third, they are afraid of being attacked by backward masses after publicizing the Marriage Law. If someone divorces or cancels an engagement, backward masses will say: This is the evil deed of so-and-so.
	Why do the above ideological concerns arise? I think the main reason is that the leading cadres of each county have not earnestly educated the rural cadres to correctly understand the Marriage Law, so that they know that correctly publicizing and implementing the Marriage Law will enable the broad masses of people to get rid of the harm of the feudal marriage system and create more democratic, harmonious, and united new families.
	Do Not Miss Remote Villages When Publicizing the Marriage Law
	Lian ZhiShui's letter: DongShan Village in the fifth district of XiangYuan, Shanxi, is a remote small village with only ten households in the whole village, and they live scattered. Over the years, county and district cadres rarely come here, and even the cadres of the administrative village do not come often. The villagers do not understand the Marriage Law and think that divorce is always a bad thing. Their saying is: There is only the beauty of helping people succeed, not the heart of harming people; divorcing one is always worse than marrying one. Hu GouDan and Liu YueYing in the village were married by their parents' arrangement, and they did not have good feelings for each other. They often quarreled, but they did not dare to divorce, so they both committed suicide by drowning. This is the harm of the Marriage Law not penetrating into poor and remote areas. Therefore, I suggest that local people's governments must not ignore every remote village when publicizing the Marriage Law in the future, so that the Marriage Law is truly known to every household.
	Literary and Art Workers Should Create a Large Number of Works to Publicize the Marriage Law
	Li FengShan, Pei RunPing, Liu JianPing's letter: Literary and art workers should create a large number of works to publicize the Marriage Law. In the past, some folk literary and art works powerfully exposed the evils of the feudal marriage system. For example, there is a folk song: "Eighteen-year-old sister, nine-year-old husband, I carry you to bed every day; if I call you husband, you are too young, if I call you son, you don't call me mother." This profoundly depicts the pain of women under the barbaric marriage system of "waiting for a boy to be a husband." The people's literary and art workers should more powerfully take up their weapons and create folk songs, clappers, drum lyrics, crosstalk, novels, songs, and other literary and art works that the people love to hear and see, to publicize the Marriage Law.
	The Marriage Registration System Should Be Implemented Seriously
	Wei WenTian's letter: Seriously implementing the marriage registration system is an important link in correctly implementing the Marriage Law and preventing arranged marriages, buying and selling marriages, and early marriages. Local people's governments should pay attention to this work. How can we do a good job in marriage registration? We have the following experience in WuJi County, Hebei Province:
	First, we must deeply and repeatedly publicize the benefits of marriage registration to the masses, so that the masses understand that the people's government is concerned about the marriage affairs of the people. In this way, we can correct the wrong view of some people that "marriage registration is the people's government meddling in other people's business," and make marriage registration a legal system that the broad masses of people are happy to implement. Second, the comrades who handle marriage registration must be serious and responsible, and must not be careless. During registration, they must carefully examine whether both men and women meet the conditions for marriage, whether they are both voluntary, and whether there are any cases of disguised buying and selling or parental arrangement. Some young men and women, especially young women, often dare not express their opinions because they are shy. Therefore, we must patiently educate them about freedom of marriage, tell them that marriage is a matter of a lifetime and cannot be taken lightly, and encourage them to speak their minds. In this way, some arranged marriages and buying and selling marriages can be discovered and dealt with in a timely manner, and the implementation of the principle of marriage autonomy can be effectively guaranteed.
	Editor's Note: WuJi County, Hebei Province, is correct in widely publicizing to the masses and seriously handling marriage registration work. At present, some areas have a tendency of formalism in handling marriage registration procedures. For example, reader Jiang Wu's letter reflects that many young men and women in PiSui County, northern Jiangsu, have their marriages decided by "parents' orders and matchmakers' words." Only on the day of the wedding do both parents take them to the district to register. Because the district cadres did not carry out in-depth publicity and serious examination, and some girls did not dare to speak their minds, marriage certificates were issued casually. It is hoped that the PiSui County People's Government will earnestly check and correct the above-mentioned tendencies. Other regions should also pay attention to prevent and correct similar tendencies.
	Reader Letters Processing in January
	In January, the reader letter group of this newspaper received a total of 7,444 reader letters and replies from various agencies to readers' letters, including 2,818 related to political and legal issues, 2,170 related to industrial and agricultural production and financial issues, 2,121 related to cultural and educational issues, and 335 letters of other nature. As of February 5, the handling of the letters was: 254 published in this newspaper, 1,828 individually replied to readers, 2,335 transferred to relevant agencies for investigation, handling, reply or reference, 2,050 retained by this newspaper for reference and not requiring further processing; the rest are being prepared for publication or are being studied and processed. In addition, there were 1,466 letters from family members of revolutionary soldiers seeking revolutionary soldiers, and the numbers were not included in the statistics.
	It should be especially mentioned the handling of letters related to opposing bureaucracy, opposing commandism, and opposing violations of law and discipline. In January, this type of letter accounted for a large proportion. Our handling principles are:
	(1) For letters exposing bad people and bad deeds, we publicly publish the more typical and serious events after investigation and research; general letters are transferred to the Party committees, people's governments or newspapers in relevant areas for handling.
	(2) For letters that can explain a problem after being concentrated - such as the letters from readers exposing various phenomena of suppressing criticism and the lack of democratic atmosphere in some schools after the Huang YiFeng incident was published, we are preparing to publish a comprehensive report.
	(3) For letters appealing against the handling of issues in the "Three-Anti" movement, in addition to selectively publishing accusations of retaliation for actively offering opinions to leading cadres in the "Three-Anti" movement and cases where the handling in the "Three-Anti" movement was indeed seriously wrong and has not been corrected to date, they are generally transferred to relevant agencies for reference and handling.
	(4) Many letters report bad people and bad deeds that have already been dealt with. We retain these letters for reference and do not process them further.
	(5) Reaction letters to bad people and bad deeds exposed by this newspaper: Reaction letters to the Huang YiFeng incident and the Wang ZhenHai incident, etc., have been summarized and published successively; reaction letters to other incidents are generally retained for reference, but those that raise questions or have different opinions are handled individually.
	In addition, it should also be mentioned that many readers' letters have raised many questions related to the convening of the National People's Congress, requesting answers. These questions have been transferred to the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government for research, and will be selectively answered comprehensively later. Readers from Hebei, Shanxi, Jiangsu, Hunan and other places have reported that local flue-cured tobacco, jute, cotton, tea oil and other cash crops are滞销 (lagging in sales), and we are studying solutions with the Ministry of Commerce.

### 读者来信摘要

1953-02-17
第2版()
专栏：读者来信摘要

    编者按：最近我们收到一些读者来信，批评有些干部对婚姻法的许多错误态度。有的存在着严重的封建思想，不愿接受婚姻法，有的不敢宣传婚姻法，有的甚至故意曲解婚姻法。这是一个值得注意的问题。事实证明：使干部正确认识婚姻法是贯彻婚姻法的重要关键之一；如果婚姻法在干部中还不能正确贯彻，要在群众中去贯彻是不可能的。现在我们把读者郭谦等三封来信发表于后，建议各地党委和人民政府在贯彻婚姻法的宣传运动月中，首先应在干部中进行系统的思想教育，并通过典型事例进行具体分析，使大家都能真正从思想上认识到新民主主义婚姻制度的优越性，纠正他们的错误思想，为进一步贯彻婚姻法打下良好的基础。
    纠正干部的封建思想才能贯彻执行婚姻法 
    归绥市很多机关干部在婚姻问题上有封建思想
    郭谦来信：最近中共归绥市委调查了市级各机关干部对婚姻法的认识，发现干部的封建思想还是很严重的。
    有些干部还有严重的男尊女卑思想。他们认为“官凭印、虎凭山，妇道人家离不了男子汉”；认为提高妇女地位会造成“阴盛阳衰，牛比马走得快”的“反常”现象。很多干部都有打骂妻子的行为。
    许多干部对贯彻婚姻法的重要意义认识不足，因此对宣传和贯彻婚姻法的工作漠不关心。年龄较大的干部表示：“我老了，今后既不离婚，也不结婚，婚姻法与我无关。”一般干部也认为贯彻婚姻法是妇联与法院的事，因此任凭封建思想到处泛滥，不加揭发和批判。
    尤其值得注意的是，归绥市人民法院的干部对婚姻法也缺乏正确的认识。该院参加有关婚姻法测验的三十八个干部，竟没有一人完全答对“什么是新民主主义婚姻制度”一题；参加思想检查的三十六个干部，有三十三个是反对自由恋爱的。
    归绥市这个情况值得各地注意；归绥市这种调查的方法也值得各地参考。
    安徽省寿县很多干部把婚姻法曲解为“离婚法”
    汤道农来信：安徽省寿县很多干部把婚姻法曲解为“离婚法”。寿县人民法院一个干部向群众宣传婚姻法时说：“我是来替打离婚的人撑腰的；谁要打离婚就准备条件。”双桥区江拐乡有两个村的干部竟互相挑战，比那个村里离婚的多，就算那个村的婚姻法贯彻得好。三和区舜南乡一个组五十三户，去年就有十三对离婚的，有的夫妇感情一向很好，偶因一时吵嘴，区政府也批准离婚了。另外有一些干部认为宣传婚姻法会“天下大乱”，就不敢宣传了。寿县人民政府应该重视这个问题，认真组织各级干部学习婚姻法，扭转干部的错误认识，正确地贯彻婚姻法。
    福建闽侯专区有些乡村干部对宣传婚姻法的顾虑很多
    张勃来信：福建闽侯专区有些乡村干部和宣传员对宣传婚姻法还有很多顾虑：第一、尚未结婚的乡干部和宣传员怕别人说他为自己找对象。的确有一些思想落后的农民曾这样嘲笑过他们。第二、怕宣传错了犯法。罗源县一个宣传员曾对我说：“宣传婚姻法说错会死人，这个责任可负不起。”第三、怕宣传婚姻法后会遭到落后群众的攻击。如果有人离婚或取消婚约时，落后群众就会说：这是某某人作的孽。
    为什么会发生以上的思想顾虑呢？我认为主要是各县领导干部没有认真地教育乡村干部正确地认识婚姻法，使他们知道：正确地宣传和贯彻婚姻法将使广大人民摆脱封建婚姻制度的毒害，造成更多的民主和睦团结生产的新家庭。
    宣传婚姻法时不要漏过偏僻的乡村
    连治水来信：山西襄垣五区东山上村是一个偏僻的小村，全村不过十户人，住得也分散。历年来县区干部很少到这儿来，就是行政村的干部来的也不多。村里群众对婚姻法都不了解，认为离婚总是坏事情。他们的说法是：只有成人之美，那有坏人之心；离一个总不如结一个好。该村胡苟旦和刘月英两人由父母包办结婚，双方感情不好，经常吵闹，但又不敢离婚，就都投水自杀了。这是婚姻法没有深入穷乡僻壤去的害处。因此，我建议各地人民政府今后宣传婚姻法时一定不要忽略每一个偏僻的村子，使婚姻法真正家喻户晓。
    文艺工作者应该大量创作宣传婚姻法的作品
    李凤山、裴润平、刘建平来信：文艺工作者应该大量创作宣传婚姻法的作品。过去有一些民间文艺作品曾经有力地揭露了封建婚姻制度的罪恶。如有一首民歌是：“十八大姐九岁郎，每天把你抱上床；说你丈夫你太小，说你儿子你不叫娘。”这深刻地刻划了“望郎媳”这种野蛮婚姻制度下妇女的痛苦。人民的文艺工作者应该更有力地拿起自己的武器，创作山歌、快板、鼓词、相声、小说、歌曲等人民喜闻乐见的文艺作品，来宣传婚姻法。
    应该认真执行结婚登记制度
    魏文田来信：认真执行结婚登记制度是正确执行婚姻法、防止买卖婚姻、包办婚姻和早婚的一个重要环节。各地人民政府应该重视这个工作。怎样才能做好结婚登记工作呢？我们河北省无极县有以下经验：
    首先，必须深入地、反复地向群众宣传结婚登记的好处，使群众都了解：人民政府办理结婚登记是关心人民的婚姻大事。这样，才能纠正某些人认为“结婚要登记是人民政府多管闲事”的错误看法，使结婚登记成为广大群众乐于执行的法律制度。其次，办理结婚登记工作的同志必须要认真负责，决不能马虎从事。登记时要认真审查男女双方是否都合结婚条件，是否都是自愿的，有没有变相买卖或家长包办的情形。有一些青年男女，尤其是青年妇女，往往因为怕羞而有意见不敢提。因此，必须耐心地向他们进行婚姻自由的教育，告诉他们结婚是一辈子的大事，不能马虎，启发他们说出心里的话来。这样，就能使一些包办、买卖婚姻的事件被及时发现和处理，切实保障婚姻自主原则的贯彻。
    编者按：河北省无极县向群众广泛宣传并认真办理结婚登记工作的作法，是正确的。目前有的地区在办理结婚登记手续时有形式主义的偏向。如读者江乌来信反映，苏北邳睢县有很多青年男女是由“父母之命、媒妁之言”决定了婚事，到结婚那天，才由双方家长带着到区里去登记。因为区干部没有深入宣传和认真审查，有的姑娘又不敢说心里话，就这样随便发了结婚证。希望邳睢县人民政府切实检查纠正上述偏向。其他地区亦应注意防止和纠正类似偏向。
    一月份读者来信处理情况
    一月份，本报读者来信组收到读者来信和各机关答复读者的来信共七千四百四十四件，其中有关政法问题的二千八百十八件，有关工农业生产和财经问题的二千一百七十件，有关文教问题的二千一百二十一件，其它性质的来信三百三十五件。截至二月五日为止，来信的处理情况是：已在本报刊登的二百五十四件，个别答复读者的一千八百二十八件，转请各有关机关调查、处理、答复或参考的二千三百三十五件，留存本报参考以及不需再作处理的二千零五十件；其余是准备发表或正在研究处理中的。此外，还有革命军人家属寻找革命军人的来信一千四百六十六件，数字未统计在内。
    应该特别提到有关反对官僚主义、反对命令主义、反对违法乱纪的来信的处理情况，一月份中这类来信占很大比重。我们的处理原则是：
    （一）揭发坏人坏事的来信，其中比较典型和严重的事件，我们经调查研究后公开发表；一般来信即转请有关地区的党委、人民政府或报纸负责处理。
    （二）集中后能说明一种问题的来信——如黄逸峰事件发表后读者揭发各种压制批评现象和某些学校缺乏民主空气情况的来信，我们准备综合发表。
    （三）申诉有关“三反”运动处理问题的来信，除控诉因“三反”运动中向领导干部积极提意见而遭到报复以及在“三反”运动中处理确有严重错误而至今尚未纠正的择要发表以外，一般是转请有关机关参考处理。
    （四）有很多来信报告的坏人坏事是已经作了处理的。这类来信，我们即留存参考，不再处理。
    （五）对本报所揭发坏人坏事的反应信：对黄逸峰事件和王振海事件等的反应信，我们已经综合，陆续发表；对其它事件的反应信，我们一般留存参考，但其中提出了问题或有不同意见的，则进行个别处理。
    此外，还应该提到的是：很多读者来信提出了不少有关召开全国人民代表大会的问题，要求解答。这些问题，我们已经转请中央人民政府内务部研究，以后将择要作综合答复。河北、山西、江苏、湖南等地读者反映当地烤烟、洋麻、棉花、茶油等经济作物滞销问题，我们正与中央商业部研究解决。
