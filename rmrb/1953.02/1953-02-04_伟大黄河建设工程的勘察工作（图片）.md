Survey Work for the Great Yellow River Construction Project
The Yellow River, which has been a scourge for thousands of years, will, in a few years, have huge hydroelectric power stations built on it. When these projects are completed, they will transmit large amounts of cheap power to factories, mines, and farmlands in the vast areas within hundreds of kilometers along the river. From then on, the Yellow River will no longer flood and cause harm; it will become a river that can be used for navigation and irrigation.

The upper and middle reaches of the Yellow River have many such canyons. Utilizing the excellent topography and geological conditions of these canyons, high dams can be built to construct huge hydroelectric power stations. At the same time, the artificial reservoirs similar to lakes and seas formed upstream of the dams can regulate water volume, develop navigation, and change the climate.

The construction of hydroelectric power stations is an extraordinarily complex and arduous undertaking. First, surveying and investigation must be carried out along the river. After excellent hydropower resource sites are discovered, further measurement and drilling work is conducted, and then comparisons are made to determine the location for constructing the hydroelectric power station. Over the past two years, Chinese survey personnel, after repeated investigations and studies in the steep canyons of the Yellow River, have discovered many places suitable for building large-scale hydroelectric power stations. This is a scene of survey personnel pulling ropes themselves while crossing the Yellow River.

After hiking over mountains and ridges for a whole day, the survey personnel rest beside their self-made tent.

A temporary volleyball court is built on the beach.

On the rapids of the Yellow River, survey personnel, with the help of the local people, cross to the opposite bank.

On the plains upstream of the canyon where the construction of a hydroelectric power station has been initially determined as possible, survey personnel are measuring the topography of the reservoir.

Survey personnel are observing in detail the topography around each area suitable for building a hydroelectric power station on the mountain tops on both sides of the Yellow River canyon.

Understanding the underground geological conditions is one of the most important steps in deciding on the construction of a dam. This is a scene of drilling personnel erecting a drilling rig.

Survey personnel are carrying out water depth measurement of the riverbed cross-section within the reservoir area.

    伟大黄河建设工程的勘察工作
    几千年来猖獗为患的黄河，若干年后将建设起巨大的水力发电站。这些工程完成后，将为沿河两岸数百公里以内广大地区的工厂、矿山和农田输送大量廉价的动力。从此，黄河再不会泛滥为害了，它将成为一条可以发展航运和灌溉田地的河流。
    黄河的上、中游有着许多像这样的峡谷。利用这些峡谷优良的地形和地质条件，可以修筑拦河高坝，建设巨大的水力发电站。同时在拦河坝的上游形成类似湖海的人工蓄水库后，还可以调节水量，发展航运和改变气候。
    水力发电站的建设工程是异常复杂而艰巨的。首先必须沿河进行勘测调查，等发现优良的水力资源地址，并作进一步的测量和钻探工作后，再加以选择比较，才能确定建设水力发电站的地点。两年来，我国查勘人员在黄河的陡山峡谷中，经过反复调查研究后，已发现许多适合建设大型水力发电站的地方。这是查勘人员横渡黄河时自己拉牵的情形。
