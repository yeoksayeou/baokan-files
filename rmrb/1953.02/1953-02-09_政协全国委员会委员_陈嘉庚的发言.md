    Chairman, fellow members, comrades:
    We are very honored to live in today's China, holding high the banner of Mao Zedong, and transitioning from a country that has suffered from imperialist aggression for a century to a new democratic, independent, and free country, and is now beginning large-scale economic construction.
    On the first day of this fourth meeting of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, listening to the political report by Vice Chairman Zhou Enlai, the work report by Vice Chairman Chen Shutong, and the report on the World People's Peace Congress's progress and achievements by Deputy Head Guo Moruo, has given us a further understanding of the domestic and international situation. In particular, all the narratives, analyses, and conclusions in Vice Chairman Zhou's political report are completely correct and encouraging, giving us more confidence to move forward towards victory. All the great achievements of the past three years, such as unified finance, stabilized prices, land reform, suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" campaigns, and the ideological remolding of intellectuals, have paved a smooth road for national construction. This series of great movements has been carried out by fully utilizing the spirit of Marxism-Leninism and the weapon of Mao Zedong Thought, combined with planned leadership. Thanks to the wise leadership and education of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, the level of awareness and organizational ability of the Chinese people has been greatly improved; and thanks to the sincere and fraternal assistance of the great ally, the Soviet Union, the advanced science and advanced working experience of the Soviet Union have continuously strengthened the creativity of the intelligent and hardworking Chinese people.
    This year marks the beginning of the great construction of the first Five-Year Plan. I believe that the people of the whole country, based on all the achievements and experiences of the past three years, will be able to give full play to their great enthusiasm and complete this difficult and glorious task ahead of schedule. The Central People's Government's decision to convene the National People's Congress and local people's congresses at all levels this year is to further strengthen the connection between the People's Government and the people, to make the state system of people's democratic dictatorship more perfect, and to continue to strengthen the power of resistance against the U.S. and aiding Korea, and to adapt to the requirements of national planned construction. At this National People's Congress, a constitution will be formulated to establish various political and organizational systems for the entire state of the People's Republic of China. The people of the whole country will, in accordance with the law, enjoy the right to elect and be elected in the election of people's representatives, and overseas Chinese are no exception. Most overseas Chinese live in the harsh environments controlled by imperialist countries and cannot obtain the same freedom of election as the people at home. However, hearing about the strength of the motherland in the past three years and the progress of large-scale economic construction, they will regard participating in the election of the People's Congress as the supreme glory and supreme comfort. They will also elect appropriate representatives of overseas Chinese in an appropriate manner, to meet the good intentions of our motherland's People's Government to cherish the millions of overseas Chinese.
    Our country has long been unified, except for Taiwan, which is occupied by American imperialists. Recently, the reactionary American government has repeatedly clamored to use the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops to harass our coastal areas. At best, it is just bandit-style harassment. In the two or three years I lived in my hometown in Fujian, Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops have landed on the coast of southern Fujian to harass several times, each time with at most four or five hundred people. They used to be local bandits, bullies, or escaped convicts and secret agents from this province, and they carried various new weapons, but they were immediately discovered by our army and civilians, completely wiped out, and no one was able to return. In addition to these extremely limited criminals who dare to land and harass, most of the soldiers who were forcibly taken overseas are homesick and willing to return to the motherland. They often return in groups of dozens or hundreds, and no longer want to be cannon fodder for Chiang Kai-shek. The U.S. imperialism's attempt to use this bandit army to land and harass will only suffer greater blows and lead to more failures.
    Long live the People's Republic of China!
    Long live Chairman Mao!

### 政协全国委员会委员  陈嘉庚的发言

    政协全国委员会委员
    陈嘉庚的发言主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    我们很荣幸能生活在今日的中国，高举毛泽东的旗帜，由一个百年来受尽帝国主义侵略苦难的国家，而进入新民主主义的独立自由的国家，且正在开始大规模的经济建设。
    在这次中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会第四次会议开会的第一天，听到周恩来副主席的政治报告、陈叔通副主席的会务报告、郭沫若副团长的世界人民和平大会经过和成就的报告，使我们对于国内和国际间的一切形势更获得进一步认识。特别是周副主席政治报告所有的叙述、分析和论断，都具有完全正确性和鼓励力量，使我们更有信心地朝着胜利前进。三年来的一切伟大成就，如统一财政、稳定物价，土地改革、镇压反革命、抗美援朝、“三反”“五反”和知识分子思想改造等为国家建设铺下平稳的道路。这一系列的伟大运动，都是充分运用马克思列宁主义精神和毛泽东思想的武器及有计划的领导相结合进行的。由于英明的毛主席和中国共产党领导和教育，中国人民觉悟程度和组织能力已大大提高；更由于伟大盟邦苏联真诚兄弟般的援助，苏联的先进科学和先进工作经验不断地加强了聪明勤朴的中国人民的创造力。
    今年开始进行第一个五年计划的伟大建设，相信全国人民在三年来一切成就和经验的基础上，必更能发挥其伟大积极性，提前完成了这艰难而光荣的任务。中央人民政府决议今年召开全国人民代表大会和地方各级人民代表大会，是为着进一步加强人民政府与人民之间的联系，使人民民主专政的国家制度更加完善，继续加强抗美援朝的力量，适应国家计划建设的要求。在这次全国人民代表大会上，更将制定宪法，以确立我中华人民共和国整个国家政治上和组织上的各种制度。全国人民在人民代表的选举中都将依法享有选举权和被选举权，国外华侨也不例外。华侨多数侨居于帝国主义国家所控制的恶劣环境之中，不能够获得和国内人民一样的自由的选举。但他们听到祖国三年来的强盛和大规模经济建设的进行，必以获得参加此次人民代表的选举为无上光荣和无上欣慰。并将用适当的方式选举出侨胞的相当代表，以符合我祖国人民政府爱护海外千余万华侨的美意。
    我们的国家除了台湾被美帝国主义者侵占外，早已全国统一。近日美国反动政府一再叫嚣，要使用蒋匪军来骚扰我沿海地方，充其量也不过是土匪式的骚扰而已。我在福建乡居的二、三年中，蒋匪军已有多次向闽南海岸登陆骚扰，每次至多四五百人。他们以前都是本省的土匪、恶霸或逃走的死犯与特务，并带有各种新式武器，但立即被我军民发觉，彻底歼灭净尽，无一人能够回去。除了这些极有限的死犯敢来登陆骚扰外，那些被强迫带往海外的士兵，大都思乡心切，愿意回到祖国来，他们往往数十人或数百人相机来归，再不愿为蒋贼当炮灰。美帝国主义企图利用这种匪军来登陆骚扰，只有会受到更大的打击，招致更多的失败的。
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    毛主席万岁！
