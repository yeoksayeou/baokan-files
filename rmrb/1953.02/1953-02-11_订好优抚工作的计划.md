    Finalize Plans for Preferential Treatment Work

    Around the Spring Festival, various localities are formulating their annual work plans. Rural areas should, in conjunction with the army support and preferential treatment for military families movement during the Spring Festival, formulate their 1953 preferential treatment work plans. In cities, plans should also be made during this period to assist families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel in finding employment and to provide preferential treatment to these families for the entire year, so as to improve preferential treatment work according to the plan.

    Preferential treatment work is closely related to the three major central tasks of the country this year. To carry out the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, we must strengthen preferential treatment work. To ensure the victory of the entire patriotic production increase movement, we must ensure that the land of the families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel also yields a bumper harvest. To raise the political status of the families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel, so that they can be loved by the people in this year's general election movement, we must strengthen education for the families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and demobilized soldiers. To accomplish these tasks well, detailed plans are essential.

    Therefore, governments at all levels in various localities must formulate preferential treatment work plans, with the focus on the village level. Ninety percent of the families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel are in rural areas. Only by formulating preferential treatment work plans at the village level can the preferential treatment work plans of provinces and counties avoid becoming empty promises.

    The main contents of the 1953 preferential treatment work plans in various villages should include the following points: (1) Mobilize and organize the families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel to participate in production. According to past experience in various localities, the best way is to absorb the families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel into mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives, so that they can fully utilize all their labor power, strengthen their ties with the masses, and improve their collectivist ideology and farming skills. (2) Do a good job in substitute farming. This requires improving the method of substitute farming, combining it with the organizational methods of cooperation and mutual assistance, and improving the substitute farming work. Within a township, balance the burden of substitute farming first, and avoid the phenomenon of uneven distribution. For families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel without labor, focus on ensuring that their lives do not experience difficulties. (3) Properly settle disabled revolutionary soldiers and demobilized soldiers, so that their living and production problems can be properly resolved. At the same time, give play to their excellent revolutionary qualities and work enthusiasm, and attract them to participate in various tasks in the countryside. (4) Educate the families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and demobilized soldiers, so that their political consciousness is constantly improved, fully realizing "Carry forward the revolutionary tradition and strive for greater glory," further increasing their political status, establishing greater prestige among the masses, and becoming the backbone for promoting various tasks and movements.

    How to formulate the plan well is an important issue. The following points should be paid special attention to when formulating the plan: (1) We must conduct in-depth research and be realistic, and not rely on subjective wishes. This requires that the formulated plan truly be "from the masses, to the masses." Therefore, various localities must mobilize the enthusiasm of the families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and demobilized soldiers themselves, and let them first make plans for themselves, and put forward their own difficulties and requirements, and organize the masses or their representatives to conduct evaluation and discussion. Mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives, when formulating their own plans, should pay attention to proposing specific plans to attract the families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel to join the teams and cooperatives. The plans formulated in this way become the plans of the masses themselves, and are bound to be practical and will not be unworkable. (2) The plan must be specific and clear. To what extent each task should be done, and what methods should be used to complete it, should all be stipulated in the plan. For example, on the issue of organizing the families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel to participate in mutual aid teams or agricultural production cooperatives, it should be proposed to strive to organize a certain percentage of all the families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel. In the plans of natural villages, it should be further determined which families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel should participate in which mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives. Such a plan is not only easy to implement, but also easy to check the work. (3) When formulating the plan, we should refer to the experience of preferential treatment work in 1952, especially learn from the advanced experience of many model preferential treatment workers and model families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel, model disabled revolutionary soldiers, and demobilized soldiers. This experience will be of great help to us in formulating the plan.

    More importantly, how to implement the plan. Therefore, after the plan is formulated, inspection teams must be organized regularly or through mass meetings to check the implementation of the work, promptly discover problems, and summarize experience to ensure the thorough realization of the 1953 preferential treatment work plan.

### 订好优抚工作的计划

    订好优抚工作的计划
    春节前后，正是各地制订一年的工作计划的时候，各地农村应结合春节期间的拥军优属运动，订出一九五三年的优抚工作计划，在城市中，也应在这期间订出帮助烈属、军属就业及优抚烈属军属的全年计划来，以便按照计划把优抚工作提高一步。
    优抚工作和今年国家的三大中心任务有着密切的关系。为了开展抗美援朝运动，必须加强优抚工作。为了保证整个爱国增产运动的胜利，必须保证烈属、军属的土地也得到丰收。为了提高烈属、军属的政治地位，使他们能在今年的普选运动中得到人民的爱戴，又必须加强对烈属、军属和革命残废军人、转业军人的教育。要很好地完成这些任务，没有周密的计划是不行的。
    因此，各地各级人民政府，都要订好优抚工作计划，而重点应放在乡村一级。全国烈属、军属百分之九十都在农村，只有把乡村一级的优抚工作计划订好了，省、县的优抚工作计划才不致于落空。
    一九五三年各地乡村优抚工作计划的主要内容，应包括以下几点：（一）发动与组织烈属、军属参加生产。根据各地过去的经验，最好的办法是把烈属、军属吸收到互助组与农业生产合作社去，这样就可以充分发挥他们的一切劳动力量，并能加强他们和群众的联系，提高他们的集体主义思想和耕作技能。（二）做好代耕工作。这就必须改进代耕的方式，结合合作互助的组织办法，把代耕工作提高一步。并在一乡之内，首先做到代耕负担的平衡，不要有畸轻畸重的现象。对于没有劳动力的烈属、军属，应着重保证他们的生活不发生困难。（三）妥善地安插革命残废军人与转业军人，使他们的生活与生产问题都能得到适当的解决。同时发挥他们的革命优良品质和工作的积极性，吸引他们参加乡村中的各种工作。（四）教育烈属、军属与革命残废军人、转业军人，使他们的政治觉悟不断提高，充分地做到“发扬革命传统，争取更大光荣”，使他们的政治地位更加增长，在群众中树立起更大的威信，成为推动各项工作和各种运动的骨干。
    如何把计划订好，这是重要的问题。以下几点就是订计划时应该特别注意的：（一）必须深入研究，实事求是，不能凭主观愿望。这就要求制订的计划真正是“从群众中来，到群众中去”。因此，各地就必须发动烈属、军属、革命残废军人、转业军人本身的积极性，让他们首先为自己做一番打算，并提出自己的困难和要求，同时组织群众或他们的代表进行评议讨论。互助组和农业生产合作社在制订自己的计划时，应注意提出吸引烈属、军属入组入社的具体计划。这样制订出来的计划，就成了群众自己的计划，必然切合实际，不致于行不通。（二）计划必须具体明确。每项工作要做到什么程度，采用什么办法去完成，都应该订在计划上。比如组织烈属、军属参加互助组或农业生产合作社这一问题，就应提出争取组织到全部烈属、军属百分之几十。在自然村的计划上，则更应确定组织那些烈属、军属参加什么互助组和农业生产合作社。这样的计划既便于执行，也便于检查工作。（三）订计划时，应参照一九五二年优抚工作的经验，特别是吸取许多模范优抚工作者以及模范烈属、军属、模范革命残废军人、转业军人的先进经验，这些经验对我们制订计划将有很大的帮助。
    更重要的是如何贯彻计划。因此，在计划制订后，必须经常组织检查组或通过群众会议的办法，检查工作执行情况，及时地发现问题，总结经验，以保证一九五三年优抚工作计划的彻底实现。
