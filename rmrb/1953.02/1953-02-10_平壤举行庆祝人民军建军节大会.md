Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, February 9th: Pyongyang's various circles held a grand meeting on the evening of the 7th to celebrate the fifth anniversary of the founding of the heroic Korean People's Army. Among those attending the meeting were: government leaders of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, headed by Kim Il-sung, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army; senior generals of the People's Army; heroes of the Republic; model workers in industry and agriculture; and representatives from various parties, social organizations, government organs, and all walks of life, totaling more than 1,000 people. Among the guests attending the meeting, the most prominent was the celebration delegation of the Chinese People's Volunteers. The delegation consisted of thirty-one male and female representatives, many of whom were combat heroes and meritorious models from various branches and units of the Volunteers. Also attending the meeting were Soviet Ambassador Razuvaev, Gan Yetao, Chargé d'Affaires of the Chinese Embassy in Korea, and personnel from the diplomatic missions of other brother countries.

The celebration meeting was held in the Pyongyang Underground Theater. The venue was brilliantly lit and decorated in a magnificent and solemn manner. A huge portrait of Kim Il-sung and the national flag of Korea hung on the rostrum, as well as huge portraits of Stalin and Mao Zedong and the national flags of the Soviet Union and China.

When the presidium, headed by Kim Il-sung, appeared on the rostrum, the entire audience cheered enthusiastically. After the meeting began under the chairmanship of Park Jung-ai, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party, Stalin, Mao Zedong, and Kim Il-sung were elected honorary chairmen of the meeting amidst thunderous applause and cheers.

Choi Yong-kun, Minister of National Defense of the Korean Cabinet, delivered a report at the meeting. He pointed out that since its founding five years ago, the People's Army has grown into a modern and regular army and has been tempered into a strong force capable of both offense and defense in the Fatherland Liberation War against the American aggressors. In the course of the Fatherland Liberation War, as of January 25 this year, eleven joint units and troops of the People's Army have been awarded the title of Guards for their outstanding combat achievements, 407 soldiers have been awarded the title of Hero of the Republic, and 424,828 soldiers have been awarded various medals and awards. Choi Yong-kun said: The international support of the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union is a reliable guarantee for the Korean people to defeat the American aggressors. The heroic Chinese People's Volunteers dispatched by the Chinese people have displayed incomparable heroism and courage in the struggle against the American aggressors. The joint combat of the Korean and Chinese People's Armies is a reliable guarantee of our victory: the consolidated friendship and unity of the Korean and Chinese soldiers is a force that imperialism cannot defeat with any strength. Our motherland and people will never forget the immortal feats established by the Chinese People's Volunteers in our Fatherland Liberation War.

Choi Yong-kun finally said: The American aggressors are unwilling to accept fair and reasonable armistice conditions and are actively deploying to expand the war. This situation requires all commanders and fighters of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers to be more vigilant and continue to strengthen preparations for protracted war and large-scale battles. If the enemy dares to launch a military adventure, we will respond to the enemy with a decisive blow.

Kim Chang-jun, representative of the Korean Fatherland Unification Democratic Front, delivered a congratulatory speech at the meeting.

Du Ping, head of the Chinese People's Volunteers delegation, stepped onto the podium amidst thunderous applause and delivered a congratulatory speech (full text to be published separately) on behalf of General Peng Dehuai, Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteers, and all commanders and fighters. Then, to the sound of friendly music, the representatives of the Chinese People's Volunteers delegation presented Kim Il-sung and the People's Army with a huge red brocade banner donated by General Peng Dehuai and all commanders and fighters of the Volunteers, and presented it to Marshal Kim Il-sung. Embroidered on the banner were the words "Under the wise leadership of General Kim Il-sung, advance victoriously to defend the motherland and strive for peace in the Far East and the world!" Many units of the Volunteers also presented banners separately.

The meeting finally unanimously adopted a message of salute to Stalin, Mao Zedong, and Kim Il-sung. After the meeting, the Korean People's Army Art Troupe performed celebratory programs, and Choi Yong-kun hosted a banquet to entertain the People's Army generals, combat heroes, and the Chinese People's Volunteers delegation.
