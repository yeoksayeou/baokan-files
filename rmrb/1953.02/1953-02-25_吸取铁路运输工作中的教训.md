The report published in today's newspaper on the Ministry of Railways' 1952 transportation plan being divorced from reality, blindly soliciting freight, and disrupting the national transportation plan is not only an important lesson for cadres in the railway system, but also has profound educational significance for cadres in other departments of state-owned enterprises.

When formulating the 1952 transportation plan, leading cadres of the railway system did not act according to objective needs and possibilities. Without thorough investigation and research, they lacked a correct calculation of the national transportation demand. Instead, they used subjective, crude estimates as the basis, unrealistically raising the transportation targets. As a result, the entire transportation plan was divorced from reality, causing economic and political losses to the country. Because railway transport capacity is neither a means of production nor a means of subsistence, but merely an added part of the value of social products. If the transportation plan is too large and not needed by the state and the people, then the human and technical measures prepared to achieve this overly large plan will inevitably be wasted, relatively increasing transportation costs. Therefore, from a formal point of view, this plan seems to be advanced, but in reality, it is a backward and one-sided plan, an uneconomical plan. Such a plan cannot improve the level of enterprise management; on the contrary, it will inevitably cause chaos in enterprise management.

Under the influence of the erroneous thinking represented by this plan, cadres in the railway system inevitably developed a one-sided viewpoint in implementing the plan. They simplified and vulgarized the significance of striving to complete the state's transportation tasks. They thought that completing the state's transportation tasks only required completing the figures, regardless of the quality, economic effects, or overall interests of the country. They separated quantity from quality, transportation tasks from financial plans, and local interests from overall interests. They did not investigate and understand the sources and flow of goods, nor did they adopt proper methods such as convening shipper meetings through party and government leading organs and financial departments at all levels to strengthen their understanding of transportation demand and expand sources of goods on the basis of enhancing the planning of transportation. Instead, they adopted the vulgar capitalist method of "hustling for business," spending a lot of manpower to solicit shippers, unscrupulously "striving" for loading figures, even taking on the task of sales promotion on behalf of shippers, "competing" with other departments of transportation, and lowering the loading capacity of each vehicle, etc., in order to "improve" transportation efficiency and "complete" the transportation plan. Some leading cadres, after the erroneous plan was issued, especially after many units had already made these mistakes in the implementation of the plan, still did not correct it, did not request to modify the erroneous plan, and even promoted the erroneous methods in the implementation of the plan as successful experiences, deepening and aggravating the chaos in the work.

Implementing the plan in this way lacks a spirit of responsibility for the interests of the state and the people; completing the task in this way is one-sided. To comprehensively complete the task, it is necessary not only to complete the quantity but also to ensure the quality. Completing the quantity is important, but ensuring the quality is even more important. In the implementation of the 1952 transportation plan, the railway system caused many serious phenomena of "irrationality" and "waste" precisely because it did not pay attention to the quality of transportation, which reduced the rate of planned transportation and caused great losses to the country. To comprehensively complete the task, it is necessary not only to complete the production and transportation plans but also to complete the technical and financial plans. In order to transport more goods and complete the transportation tasks, some units of the railway system even organized more than 10,000 cadres and personnel to solicit sources of goods. Just this matter alone wasted a lot of manpower and money, disrupted the work deployment, was not in line with the principles of economic accounting, and caused losses in work. To comprehensively complete the task, it is necessary not only to consider the problem from the perspective of the local tasks of the system and unit but also to consider the problem from the perspective of the overall and national interests. Leaving or violating the interests of the whole will inevitably cause extremely bad results. Some of the wrong practices adopted by the railway system in the implementation of the 1952 transportation plan precisely lacked this overall perspective.

The mistakes made by the railway system in formulating and implementing the 1952 transportation plan make us deeply realize that a work style that does not understand objective needs and possibilities and is divorced from reality is a serious enemy in planning work. If a leader is infected with this work style, they will commit serious mistakes of bureaucratism and formalism, will not be able to truly complete the tasks stipulated in the state plan, will dampen the enthusiasm and creativity of the vast number of personnel and the working people, and will cause economic and political losses, harming the cause of the state and the people. This is a lesson we must remember. We hope that the railway system, when preparing this year's plan, will not only overcome the tendency of unrealistically setting the plan too high but also strictly prevent and correct the tendency of lowering the plan, and will correctly formulate the 1953 transportation plan on the basis of accurately calculating objective needs and tapping potential.

Here we must also point out that while the strengthening of transportation planning is mainly the responsibility of the railway department, various economic departments also have the responsibility to strengthen the consignment plan and consign on time, and governments and financial leading organs at all levels have the responsibility to supervise and inspect. In the past, the phenomenon that certain economic departments and financial leading organs in certain regions did not pay attention to the preparation, implementation, and inspection of the consignment plan must also be overcome and corrected.

### 吸取铁路运输工作中的教训

    吸取铁路运输工作中的教训
    今天本报发表的铁道部一九五二年运输计划脱离实际、盲目招揽货运、打乱国家运输计划的报道，不仅对于铁路系统的干部说来是一个重要的教训，对于国营企业其他部门的干部也是有深刻教育意义的。
    铁路系统领导干部在制定一九五二年运输计划时，没有按照客观的需要和可能，不经过周密的调查研究，对全国运输的需要量缺乏正确的计算，而把主观的粗枝大叶的推测和估计当作根据，不切实际地提高了运输任务，因此使整个运输计划脱离了实际，并且在经济上、政治上给国家造成了损失。因为铁路的运输力，既不是生产资料，也不是生活资料，只是社会生产品价值的追加部分。如果运输计划大了，而不为国家和人民所需要，那么，为实现这种过大计划所准备的人力和技术措施，就必然白白地浪费掉，使运输成本相对地提高了。因而从形式上看，这个计划好像是先进的，实际上则是一个落后的片面的计划，不合经济核算的计划。这样的计划不仅不能提高企业管理的水平，相反的，它必然造成了企业管理的混乱。
    在这个计划所代表的错误思想的影响下，铁路系统的干部在执行计划时也就必然产生了片面的观点。他们把努力完成国家运输任务的意义简单化和庸俗化了。他们以为完成国家运输任务，只要完成数目字就行，可以不管质量的好坏，不管经济的效果，不管国家全局的利益。他们把数量和质量割裂开来，把运输任务和财务计划割裂开来，把局部利益和全局利益割裂开来。他们不去调查了解货源、货流的情况，通过各级党政领导机关和财经部门，采取召开货主会议等正当办法，以加强对运输需要量的了解，并在增强运输计划性的基础上去扩大货源，而是采取资产阶级庸俗的“兜生意”的办法，花费大量人力去招揽货主，不择手段地“争取”装车数字，甚至代替货主包揽推销任务，与交通运输的其他部门“竞争”，压低每辆车的装载量等等，以“提高”运输效力，“完成”运输计划。有的领导干部，当错误的计划下达后，特别是当不少单位在执行计划中已发生了这些错误之后，仍然不加以纠正，不提出请求去修改错误的计划，甚至反而把执行计划中的错误方法当作成功的经验加以推广，加深和加重了工作中的混乱。
    这样地执行计划，是缺乏为国家人民利益负责的精神的，这样地完成任务是片面的。全面地完成任务，就不仅要完成数量，而且要保证质量。完成数量固然重要，但保证质量则更为重要。铁路系统在执行一九五二年运输计划中，正是由于不重视运输质量，造成了许多“不合理”的和“浪费”的严重现象，使计划运输的比率降低，给国家造成了很大损失。全面地完成任务，就不仅要完成生产、运输计划，同时还必须完成技术、财务计划。铁路系统某些单位为了多运载一些货物，完成运输任务，竟组织了一万多干部人员去招揽货源，只就这件事来说，就浪费了大量的人力和金钱，打乱了工作部署，既不合经济核算的原则，又造成工作上的损失。全面地完成任务，就不只要从本系统本单位的局部任务出发去考虑问题，而且必须从全局和国家的整个利益出发去考虑问题。离开了或者违犯了全局的利益，必然造成极坏的结果。铁路系统在执行一九五二年运输计划中所采取的一些错误作法，正是缺乏这种全局观点的。
    铁路系统在制定和执行一九五二年运输计划中所发生的错误，使我们深刻认识到：不了解客观需要与可能、脱离实际的作风，是计划工作中严重的敌人。如果一个领导者染上了这种作风，就要犯严重的官僚主义、形式主义错误，就不可能真正完成国家计划中所规定的任务，就会挫伤广大人员和劳动人民的积极性、创造性，造成经济上政治上的损失，危害国家人民的事业。这是我们必须记取的教训。我们希望铁路系统在编制今年的计划时，既要克服不切实际的把计划定得过高的偏向，也要严格防止和纠正压低计划的偏向，而要在确实计算客观需要和发挥潜力的基础上，正确制定一九五三年的运输计划。
    这里我们还必须指出：运输计划性的加强，固然主要是铁路部门的责任，但各个经济部门也有责任加强托运计划并按时托运，各级政府和财经领导机关则负有督促和检查的责任。过去某些经济部门和某些地区的财经领导机关不重视编制执行和检查托运计划的现象，也必须加以克服和纠正。
