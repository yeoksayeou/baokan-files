    Ministry of Heavy Industry Sends Large Numbers of Cadres Deep into Lower Levels to Inspect Basic Construction Preparations

    [This newspaper dispatch] In earnest implementation of Chairman Mao's instruction at the Fourth Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference to "oppose bureaucracy in our leadership organs and among our leading cadres at all levels," the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry has dispatched working groups deep into the lower levels to inspect basic construction preparations.

    The scale of this inspection work by the Ministry of Heavy Industry is quite large. It is initially determined that the inspection will be completed in about one and a half months in general areas, and two months in remote areas. The ministry has transferred more than 250 cadres from various bureaus and departments, forming 13 inspection groups, including 11 bureau chiefs and department directors, and 30 section chiefs and division chiefs. The main basic construction units to be inspected this time are about 25, with the focus on five locations: Anshan, Fushun, Shandong, Dongchuan (Huize County), Yunnan, and northern Manchuria. After these inspection groups arrive at the local professional bureaus, they will expand the inspection force, go deep into the basic construction units, and extensively mobilize workers to launch a mass inspection campaign.

    The most important aspect of basic construction preparation is the progress of the project. Poor preparation will affect the timely completion of the construction plan. Judging from the existing materials alone, there are many problems in the preparation work of the basic construction units under the ministry. Some units lack sufficient understanding of the national construction plan and do not actively find ways to complete the task. For example, some cadres at the Shandong 501 Factory believe that "plans are emphasized every year, but most are not completed; it doesn't matter if they are not completed this year." Some units unilaterally emphasize production, affecting basic construction preparation. For example, leaders of the Dalian Chemical Plant are afraid of affecting production and have not yet concentrated the basic construction forces, and other preparations are also poorly done. Some units do have difficulties, such as the Fushun 301 Factory, whose basic construction task this year is ten times larger than last year's, not only requiring a large amount of investment, but also high technical requirements, which need to be helped to complete the task. There are also construction units that have not handled the relationship with the construction units well, and the problems cannot be solved. For example, the construction unit and the construction unit of the Shenyang Chemical Plant have different opinions, which affects the progress of the work. In addition, some leading cadres of certain units have a bureaucratic work style, do not study their work diligently, and do not truly value the plan, so the preparation work is slow. In addition, although some problems have been solved above, there are still difficulties in doing them below. For example, entrusted design and equipment ordering still have problems in terms of time and conditions. If these problems are not resolved in time, they will inevitably affect the smooth progress of basic construction.

    The ministry stipulates that each inspection group should start with key issues such as design, equipment, materials, and construction forces, discover a large number of specific problems in the preparation work, obtain the guidance and help of the local party committee, and strive to solve the problems locally as much as possible. Problems related to other ministries or other aspects should be reported to the ministry for resolution. In the process of inspection, it is necessary to expose shortcomings, launch struggles against erroneous ideas, and promptly discover and commend good deeds, so as to establish correct planning concepts among the broad masses of cadres and masses. In this way, a good foundation will be laid for completing the 1953 basic construction plan both materially and ideologically. Through this inspection work, the leading organs will further closely link up with practical work and the masses of employees, which will be of great help to improving and improving leadership work, and will also be a good self-education for the comrades in the inspection work.

### 重工业部派大批干部深入下层检查基本建设准备工作

    重工业部派大批干部深入下层检查基本建设准备工作
    【本报讯】中央重工业部认真执行毛主席在人民政协第一届全国委员会第四次会议上提出的“要在我们各级领导机关和领导干部中反对官僚主义”的指示，已派出工作组深入下层，检查基本建设准备工作。
    重工业部这次检查工作的规模是很大的，初步确定一般地区在一个半月内检查完毕，边远地区检查时间为两个月。该部已从各局、司调集干部二百五十余人，组成十三个检查组，其中有局长、司长十一人，处长、科长三十人。这次要检查的主要基本建设单位有二十五个左右，检查工作的重点为鞍山、抚顺、山东、云南东川（会泽县）和北满等五处。这些检查组到达地方专业局后，在检查工作时将扩大检查力量，深入基本建设单位，普遍发动职工，展开群众性的检查运动。
    基本建设准备工作首要的是工程进度，准备工作如做得不好将影响建设计划的及时完成。仅从现有材料来看，目前该部所属基本建设单位的准备工作中存在着不少问题。有的单位对国家建设计划认识不足，不积极地想办法完成任务。如山东五○一厂有些干部认为“年年强调计划，大都没有完成；今年完不成也没有关系”。有的单位片面地强调生产，影响了基本建设准备工作。如大连化学厂领导干部怕影响生产，还没有把基本建设力量集中起来，其他准备工作也做得很差。有的单位确实有些困难，如抚顺三○一厂今年基本建设任务比去年大十倍，不仅投资量大，而且在技术上的要求也很高，需要加以帮助，才能完成任务。还有的建设单位与施工单位的关系没搞好，问题不得解决。如沈阳化工厂建设单位与施工单位互有意见，影响了工作的进行。还有某些单位的领导干部存在着官僚主义作风，不钻研业务，没有真正重视计划，准备工作进展迟缓。另外，有些问题上边虽已解决，但下边做起来还有困难。如委托设计、设备定货等，在时间与条件上还存在问题。这些问题如不及时解决，必将影响基本建设的顺利进行。
    该部规定各检查组应从设计、设备、材料、施工力量等关键问题下手，大量发现准备工作中的具体问题，取得地方党委的指导与帮助，尽可能争取就地解决问题，有关其他部或其他方面的问题，再报部解决。在检查过程中，必须揭发缺点，向错误思想展开斗争，并及时发现与表扬好的事例，在广大干部和群众中树立正确的计划观念。这样，从物质上和思想上，为完成一九五三年基本建设计划打下良好基础。通过这次检查工作，领导机关将进一步与实际工作及职工群众密切联系起来，这对改进与提高领导工作将有很大帮助，对检查工作的同志来说，也是一次很好的自我教育。
