Comrades Chairman and members,
I express my sincere endorsement and enthusiastic support for Vice Chairman Zhou Enlai's "Political Report," Vice Chairman Chen Shutong's "Report on the Work of the Standing Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference," and Deputy Head Guo Moruo's "Report on the Course and Achievements of the World People's Peace Congress."

Vice Chairman Zhou put forward the three major tasks for 1953 to the people of the whole country in his report. This was planned after summarizing the domestic and international situations and is in line with the highest interests of the people of the whole country.

The US imperialists launched a shameful war of aggression against Korea. Under the heavy blows of the heroic Chinese and Korean People's forces, they have suffered a tragic defeat. However, the US imperialists have not learned a lesson from their defeat. They are still trying their best to expand the war. Eisenhower and Dulles' recent series of arrogant remarks and perverse actions all show that the American aggressors are not only unwilling to "call it quits" in Korea, but also attempt to make the flames of war burn more fiercely. Therefore, in order to ensure the progress of our construction cause and a happy and peaceful life, and in order to safeguard peace in the Far East and the world, we must undoubtedly continue to strengthen the great struggle to resist US aggression and aid Korea. I firmly believe that the Chinese people under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party have enough courage and wisdom, and are fully prepared and powerful enough to defeat US imperialist aggression and win the final victory in the struggle to resist US aggression and aid Korea.

The Five-Year Construction Plan, which starts this year, is the beginning of our country's great construction. For more than three years, we have cleared away obstacles and overcome difficulties, and have made full preparations for large-scale, planned economic construction, so that we can carry out construction work that is extremely large in scale from the very beginning, so that our country can gradually industrialize and steadily advance towards socialism, and meet the growing material and cultural needs of the broad masses of the people. This fact eloquently shows that the ideals that the Chinese people have dreamed of, and the reasonable aspirations of the Chinese people to get rid of poverty and ignorance, can only be realized under the leadership of the great Chairman Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist Party. It is conceivable that the announcement of the target figures for the first year of this plan will set off a boiling labor enthusiasm across the country, attracting millions of working people to work hard to complete and overfulfill the planned figures.

In our country, industrialization and democratization are inseparable and complementary. Using democratic life to ensure economic construction will make economic construction smoother and greatly reduce and avoid the serious harm of bureaucracy and commandism to economic construction. This year, the convening of people's congresses at the township, county, and provincial (municipal) levels elected by the people through universal suffrage, and then convening the National People's Congress on this basis, is of immeasurable significance. The proposal of this task in itself illustrates the superiority of our country's political system. That is to say, only the people's country allows the people to enjoy full democratic rights and truly be the masters of their own affairs. This is a major event in the political life of our people. Relying on the people's awareness and organization, and giving full play to the people's political enthusiasm, we will certainly be able to overcome the difficulties that will or may arise in this heavy and meticulous work and successfully complete the task.

As Vice Chairman Zhou said: "The three tasks before us are important and glorious." In particular, economic construction and the implementation of universal suffrage are new tasks for the people of the whole country, so there will be more difficulties. However, with the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, and with the people of all strata of the country united and working together, we will surely be able to achieve decisive victories on these three fronts.

    政协全国委员会委员
    程潜的发言主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    周恩来副主席的“政治报告”、陈叔通副主席的“中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会常务委员会关于会务的报告”和郭沫若副团长“关于世界人民和平大会的经过和成就的报告”，我表示竭诚的拥护和热烈的支持。
    周副主席在报告中向全国人民提出来的一九五三年的三大任务，是总结国内外形势之后规划出来的，是符合于全国人民的最高利益的。
    美帝国主义者发动了可耻的侵朝战争，在英勇的中朝人民部队的沉重打击下已经遭受了悲惨的失败，但是，美帝国主义者仍没有从失败中吸取教训，它仍在千方百计地扩大战争。艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯最近陆续发表的狂妄言论及其倒行逆施，在在说明美国侵略者不但不愿在朝鲜“善罢甘休”，反而企图把战火燃烧得更加猛烈。因此，为了保障我们建设事业的进行和幸福安乐的生活，为了维护远东和世界的和平，我们毫无疑问地必须继续加强抗美援朝的伟大斗争。我坚信，在毛主席和中国共产党领导下的中国人民，有足够的魄力和智慧，有充分的准备和力量，来战胜美帝国主义侵略，赢得抗美援朝斗争的最后胜利。
    从今年起开始的五年建设计划，是我们国家伟大的建设的开端。三年多来，我们扫清了障碍，排除了困难，已为大规模的、有计划的经济建设作了充分的准备，使我们能有条件来进行一开始就是规模极其宏大的建设工作，以便我们国家逐步工业化，并稳步地向社会主义前进，满足广大人民日益增长的物质和文化生活的需要。这一事实雄辩地表明：中国人民梦寐以求的理想，中国人民渴切地希望摆脱穷困和愚昧的合理愿望，只有在伟大的毛泽东主席和中国共产党领导下才能实现。可以想像，这个计划第一年度指标数字的宣布，将在全国掀起沸腾的劳动热情，吸引千百万劳动人民，为完成和超额完成计划数字而努力。
    在我们的国家里，工业化和民主化是不可分离的，是相辅相成的。用民主生活来保证经济建设，将更加使经济建设顺利进行，将大大减少和避免官僚主义和命令主义对经济建设的严重危害。在今年内，召开由人民用普选方法产生的乡、县、省（市）各级人民代表大会，并在此基础上接着召开全国人民代表大会，其意义之大是无法估计的。提出这一任务，其本身就说明了我们国家政权制度的优越性。也就是说，只有人民的国家，才让人民享有充分的民主权利，让人民真正当家作主。这是我国人民政治生活中的一个巨大事件，依靠人民的觉悟程度和组织程度，发挥人民的政治热情，我们一定能够克服这一繁重细致工作中将要出现或可能出现的困难，胜利地完成任务。
    如周副主席所说：“摆在我们面前的三项任务，是重大的，也是光荣的。”特别是经济建设和实行普选，对全国人民来说都是新的工作，因此困难也就更多。但是，有毛主席和中国共产党的领导，全国各阶层人民同心同德，一致努力，就一定能在这三条战线上取得决定性的胜利。
