Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 15th: The Soviet people warmly celebrate the third anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance. Mass rallies were held in industrial enterprises, educational institutions, and local Soviet polling stations throughout the country. At the meetings, specialists reported on the achievements of the great Chinese people in building a new life, and read out the congratulatory telegrams exchanged between Chairman Stalin and Chairman Mao Zedong. In Leningrad, reporters from the Soviet Society for the Dissemination of Political and Scientific Knowledge gave lectures on New China to workers at the Kirov Factory, students at the Mining Engineering Institute, and sailors of the Baltic Merchant Fleet. More than 700 voters in the Vasilyevsky Ostrov electoral district also listened to reports on the People's Republic of China.

These days, exhibitions about New China held throughout the Soviet Union are particularly crowded. The Moscow State Museum of Oriental Culture displays many ancient and modern Chinese cultural and artistic works. Many viewers gathered around paintings and sculptures reflecting the Chinese people's struggle for a happy life, as well as folk art expressing the Chinese people's love for Chairman Mao Zedong and Chairman Stalin. The Chinese exhibition at the Kiev Museum of Western and Oriental Art has also been a great success. Portraits of Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin, and Mao Zedong embroidered by the Chinese working people are on display there, and are very popular with the audience. Many viewers wrote down their impressions in the visitor's books of the museums, expressing their admiration for the art of the great Chinese people and their ardent desire to strengthen the friendship and cultural cooperation between the people of China and the Soviet Union.
