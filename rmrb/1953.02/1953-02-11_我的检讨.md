    My Self-Criticism
    Wen Xianglan
    My name is Wen Xianglan, and I am from Hetang Township, District 3, Lushan County. My studies are insufficient, and I am not clear about the policies of the Party and the People's Government. I only knew that being a model was glorious, but I didn't know how to play a model role. When I came to the province this time to participate in the mutual aid and cooperation training class, I still had some complacency and arrogance. Later, when someone pointed out to me that my high-yield wheat production was fake, I was very scared. At first, I wanted to talk about it, but I was afraid of being punished, afraid of being detrimental to my cooperative and myself, so I stubbornly insisted that it was a real high yield and even put forward many "high-yield" reasons. But the facts were not like that at all. The facts investigated by Kan Feng were true, and I had to soften my stance. I thought to myself, I am a member of the Communist Youth League, and I have made a mistake. How can I face people?
    The leaders of the training class helped me again and again. From their conversations, I saw that they not only did not hit me or discriminate against me, but also comforted me and advised me to study with peace of mind. I thought to myself that I really couldn't hide it anymore, so today I will talk about the root cause of this matter, firstly to warn myself in the future, and secondly so that everyone can learn a lesson from this matter.
    I organized a mutual aid group in 1950. Thanks to the leadership of the Party and my own efforts, I was elected as a model in June 1951. I was worthy of this election as a model. Because at that time, I took the lead in taking care of the families of military personnel, donating to resist US aggression and aid Korea, and promoting policies. After being selected as a model, I joined the Communist Youth League, and my work became more active. The district only praised me and did not criticize me, so I developed arrogance and complacency. In the autumn of 1951, when I participated in the labor model conference in the county, I reported that my sweet potato yield was 8,000 catties per mu. At that time, many labor models did not believe it and asked me one after another, and I had no way to answer. In fact, my one mu of sweet potatoes yielded eight carts, and the team members said that one cart was about 1,000 catties (actually less than 1,000 catties). At that time, the county and district cadres not only did not check this issue, but also said to those doubting labor models: People have produced enough, if you don't believe it, you are attacking people. Other labor models thought that anyway, the county and district were cultivating key figures, so they didn't care who was the model. Labor model He Qingfeng said:
    "Next year, I will say that my sweet potatoes yield 10,000 catties per mu, anyway, that's the trend." Later, the newspaper published the news that my sweet potatoes yielded 9,600 catties, and I didn't know what was going on. The villagers were also not satisfied with the newspaper.
    Last year, the district asked me to grow high-yield wheat, but we were not prepared, and the base fertilizer was not sufficient. The cooperative cadres all said: "Take your seven fen, and then draw two mu and three fen from Zhang Fuxing's land as high-yield land, and then add more topdressing fertilizer." District cadre Guo Wenquan personally stepped out the mu, but because the base fertilizer was insufficient, the wheat could not reach the high-yield standard. Everyone was very anxious, thinking, how could we live up to the county and district governments if we didn't achieve high yields? The thought of winning awards was also dominating me. Later, Zhang Zhixin, the agricultural section chief, said: "Anyway, for the sake of high yield, let's cheat a little!" I did not object. As a result, seventeen wheat bundles harvested from other fields were added to the wheat harvested from my seven fen of land; and one cart of wheat harvested from another plot was added to the two mu and three fen of wheat in Zhang Fuxing's field, so a total of 2,030 catties were harvested, averaging 676 catties per mu. In fact, our land could only yield a maximum of 400 catties per mu. After we reported the false materials to the district, no one came to check, and this cheated us out of an award.
    I felt very sad after doing this. I was always afraid of being discovered, and I also thought that the Party and the People's Government were so concerned about me, but I was deceiving the Party and the People's Government, which was really wrong. But I also thought: if I told the truth, I was afraid that I would not get the award, that the members of the cooperative would not understand, that the county and district leaders would attack me, and that others would look down on me. Now I know that only by speaking out can I make progress and make up for the losses of the Party and the People's Government. In addition to asking the higher authorities to punish me, I also ask the leaders of Lushan County and District to be cautious in handling such issues in the future, so as to avoid such things from happening again. I will definitely study hard and actively produce in the future, so that I can become a real high-yield model to repay the Party and the People's Government for their help, and I guarantee to the Party and the People's Government that I will never make this mistake again.

    我的检讨
    文香兰
    我叫文香兰，是鲁山县三区贺堂乡人。我学习不够，对党与人民政府的政策不明确。光知道当模范光荣，但不知道要怎样才能起模范作用。这次来省参加互助合作训练班学习时，还有些自满和骄傲情绪。以后有人对我提出我的小麦高额丰产是假的，我心中非常害怕。开始本想谈出来，但是怕受处分，怕对自己的社和自己不利，便一口咬死是真丰产，而且还提出了许多“丰产”理由。可是事实完全不是那样。阚枫调查的事实是真的，我不得不软了下来。我想着自己是一个青年团员，犯了错误，咋有脸见人呢？
    训练班领导同志再三帮助我。从他们的谈话中，我看到他们不但没有打击我和歧视我，而且还安慰我，劝我安心学习。自己想着实在不能再这样隐瞒下去了，所以我今天特把这件事的根源谈一谈，一来使自己今后警惕起来，二来大家也可以从这件事中取得教训。
    我在一九五零年组织互助组，由于党的领导和自己的努力，在一九五一年六月便被选为模范。在这次选举模范中，自己是无愧的。因为那时无论在照顾军属方面，在抗美援朝捐献方面，在宣传政策方面都起了带头作用。被选为模范后，自己又参加了青年团，工作更加积极了。区里对我光表扬不批评，我就滋长了骄傲自满情绪。一九五一年秋我在县里参加劳动模范会议时，报告了我的红薯丰收八千斤（一亩）。当时很多劳动模范都不信，纷纷问我，我没有办法答复。实际是我的一亩红薯收了八车，组员说一车大约有一千斤（实际不够一千斤）。当时县、区干部不但没有检查这一问题，而且还对那些怀疑的劳动模范说：人家打够了，不相信，就是打击人。其他劳动模范以为反正是县、区为了培养重点，管他叫谁当模范哩。劳动模范贺庆凤说：
    “明年我说我的红薯一亩收了一万斤，反正兴这。”后来报纸又登出我的红薯收了九千六百斤的消息，我也不知咋回事，村上群众对报纸也不满意。
    去年区上叫我搞丰产小麦，但我们没有准备，底肥没有加够。社里干部都说：“就以你的七分，再在张福星地里抽二亩三分为丰产地，以后多加追肥就可以了”，区干部郭文泉还亲自步了步地亩，可是由于底肥不足，麦子是达不到高额丰产标准的。大伙都很着急，以为达不到大丰产如何对得起县、区政府？又怕县、区放弃了对我社的领导。想得奖的思想也在支配着我。后来，农业股长张志信说：“反正为了丰产，咱就对点假吧！”我也未加反对。结果在我的七分地收的麦子里，加上了由别的地里收的十七个麦捆子；又在张福星的二亩三分麦子里，加上从另外一块地多割的一车麦子，这样就共计打了二千零三十斤，平均每亩六百七十六斤。其实我们的地每亩最多只能打四百斤。我们以假材料报区后，区上也无人来检查，这就骗取了一个奖励。
    做了这件事，我心中非常难过。我老怕别人发觉，又想到党和人民政府对自己如此关怀，自己反而欺骗了党和人民政府，实在太不对了。但我又想：要是说了实话，怕得不了奖，怕社员思想不通，怕县、区领导方面打击自己，怕别人看不起。现在我知道了：只有说出来才是自己的进步，才可以挽回党和人民政府的损失。我除请上级给我处分外，并请鲁山县、区领导方面今后处理这类问题必须慎重，以免再有这些事情发生。我今后一定努力学习，积极生产，使自己成为真正的丰产模范，来报答党和人民政府对我的帮助，并向党与人民政府保证：我今后一定不再犯这种错误。
