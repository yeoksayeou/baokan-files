The Shenyang Construction Workers' Winter Training Class has now entered the technical education phase.

Before commencing technical education, the Shenyang Municipal Party Committee's Basic Construction Political Department investigated the workers' demands, attitudes, and thoughts regarding learning technology. For example, skilled workers wanted to improve their skills, and second-grade workers hoped to learn blueprint reading and material cutting to be promoted to first-grade workers, but they lacked interest in learning advanced Soviet experience. General apprentices were willing to learn the advanced experience of Soviet Chang You's three-stage bricklaying method, but were unwilling to seriously learn basic operational techniques, and had a desire for quick success. After understanding these situations, the leadership combined this with political study to correct the students' learning attitudes. At the same time, they collected various advanced experience and technical materials from the former Northeast Industrial Department, the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions, and various basic construction units, and distributed them to the winter training classes to compile teaching materials. In mid-January, the Basic Construction Political Department of the Shenyang Municipal Party Committee convened responsible cadres from various winter training classes to discuss in detail the significance and purpose, content and steps, teachers, teaching materials and teaching methods of technical education, and issued instructions.

Many units made full preparations before technical education. The Winter Training Class of the Shenyang Municipal Housing Management Bureau's Engineering Company formulated a specific technical education plan with emphasis, based on the needs of the construction tasks. Last year, almost all of the company's tasks were new construction projects. This year, in addition to a quarter of new construction projects, most were larger repair projects. Based on such tasks, the company checked its existing strength and found that the focus of technical education should be to solve the difficulties of insufficient bricklayers and carpenters in repair projects, and corrected the original education plan of evenly cultivating technical strength. The company also investigated the technical conditions of the workers: how many workers have mastered two techniques, and how many apprentices and laborers need to be trained into technicians during the winter training period, and investigated the workers' learning requirements, such as the existing 200 apprentices and more than 100 laborers who are willing to learn bricklaying techniques, and they have already learned some during the construction last year. If this group of workers can reach the technician level, they will be able to solve the problem of "large tasks and small strength" in the bricklaying trade. After such an investigation and the proposal of solutions, a more practical education plan was formulated. Although these units lack experience in technical education, they have made preparations for technical education due to the importance attached by leading cadres and their reliance on the masses. Other units, however, did not pay much attention to the preparation work for technical education. They emphasized: "The start date of construction is approaching, and there is still a lot of construction preparation work to be done." They believed that "the winter training period is very short, and it is impossible to improve the technical level of workers." They did not concentrate their efforts to formulate education plans and compile teaching materials. The Winter Training Class of the Mechanical Bureau's Civil Engineering and Construction Company did not have a clear understanding of the purpose of technical education, and proposed in the education plan: "appropriately" promote advanced experience in order to "achieve the purpose of reducing costs." Some units also focused mainly on lecturing as the method of technical education. According to the situation of these units, it is impossible to implement the guiding principle of focusing on learning and promoting advanced Soviet experience and the teaching method of focusing on practical exercises and supplementing with lectures.

Furthermore: The Shenyang No. 1 Construction Company's Winter Training Class adopted technical teaching methods suitable for the needs of workers, and achieved good results.

The first phase of this class, technical education, started on February 13. Before the start of classes, some teachers collected a lot of materials and compiled teaching materials like giving lectures to school students, lecturing on "hydration" to concrete workers, lecturing on "the nature of light" to painters, and lecturing on "squaring" to carpenters. The workers could not accept it. Most of the teachers were unprepared, and only listed a few lecture outlines, some without even an outline. Therefore, after the start of classes, they had to change the teaching plan and temporarily lecture the workers on technical safety and general knowledge of blueprints. The leadership took this opportunity to urge the teachers to quickly compile teaching materials, and proposed that the teaching materials must meet the needs of the workers. According to this spirit, the teachers went to the workers' dormitories to invite old workers and discuss their own compiled teaching materials with them, soliciting opinions. The electrical teacher originally wanted to lecture the workers on the principles of electric motors and transformers, but the workers said: These things need to be learned, but unfortunately the learning time is short, and they will not be used in this year's construction. The teacher then revised the teaching plan according to the workers' opinions. The teacher lacked specific examples when lecturing on general technical principles, and also asked old workers to help supplement them. The teaching materials compiled in this way are more suitable for the workers' requirements.

The initial difficulty encountered during lectures was the inconsistency of the workers' technical and cultural levels. Generally speaking, old workers have high technical skills and low cultural levels; young workers are the opposite. After research, electrical teachers Tong Shibin and Bu Tiehan lectured twice according to the technical and cultural levels of third- and fourth-grade workers. Only six or seven of the 64 students in the class could not understand clearly, proving that this method was better. In the teaching process, methods of imagery and physical object teaching were also adopted. When lecturing on architectural drawings, the workers could not understand the sections and main surfaces, so the teacher put out an architectural model to explain. The workers said: If you had told us this way earlier, we would have understood it a long time ago. When learning various advanced experiences, the advanced producers gave demonstrations in the classroom in the morning, and the workers took turns to practice, discuss, and summarize the next day. When lecturing workers of special trades, various machines were moved out to lecture on general technical principles and practical operation.

Organizing technical research groups and learning mutual aid groups is a good way to implement the teaching plan. The technical research group is composed of first-grade technicians from each group of the same trade. They help students answer questions in learning, reflect problems in learning to the teachers, and put forward opinions on improving the content of teaching materials and teaching methods. The learning mutual aid group is composed of two workers with different technical and cultural levels helping each other. For example, electrician Gao Fengshan is 41 years old this year and originally illiterate, but now he is learning some electrical principles. His apprentice has some culture, so the apprentice teaches the master mathematics, and the master teaches the apprentice technology. Now the workers can use "Ohm's Law" to calculate electrical power. The apprentice's technology has been improved to the level of fifth- and sixth-grade workers.

    沈阳建筑工人冬训班进入技术教育阶段第一工程处教学方法好技术教育收效大
    沈阳建筑工人冬训班现已进入技术教育阶段。
    在进行技术教育前，中共沈阳市委基本建设政治部调查了工人学习技术的要求、态度和思想情况。如技术工人愿意提高技术，二级工希望学会看图下料提升为一级工，但对学习苏联先进经验缺少兴趣。一般学徒愿意学习苏长有三段砌砖法的先进经验，但是不愿认真学习基本的操作技术，有急于求成的想法。在了解了这些情况以后，领导方面便结合政治学习，端正了学员的学习态度。同时并搜集了原东北工业部、东北总工会和各基本建设单位的各种先进经验技术材料，分送各冬训班编制教材。一月中旬，中共沈阳市委基本建设政治部召集各冬训班负责干部，详细讨论了技术教育的意义和目的，内容和步骤，教员、教材和教学方法等，并发出了指示。
    不少单位在技术教育前做了充分的准备工作。沈阳市房产局工程公司冬训班根据施工任务需要，制订了有重点的技术教育具体计划。去年该公司的任务几乎全是新建工程，今年除四分之一新建工程外，都是较大的修补工程。根据这样的任务，该公司检查了现有的力量，发现技术教育的重点应该是解决修补工程中瓦工、木工不足的困难，纠正了最初制订的平均培养技术力量的教育计划。该公司同时调查了工人的技术条件：有多少工人已掌握两种技术，有多少徒工和劳动工需要在冬训期间培养成技工，调查了工人的学习要求，如现有二百名徒工和一百多名劳动工都愿意学习瓦工技术，而且他们在去年施工中已学会了一些，如果使这批工人达到技工水平，就能够解决瓦工工种中“任务大，力量小”的问题。经过这样的调查，提出解决办法，就制订出了比较切合实际的教育计划。这些单位虽然缺乏技术教育的经验，但是由于领导干部重视，依靠群众，已做好了技术教育的准备工作。另外有些单位却不很重视技术教育的准备工作。他们强调：
    “离开工日期近了，还有许多施工准备工作要做。”认为“冬训时期很短，不可能把工人技术水平提高。”没有集中力量订出教育计划和编制教材。机械局土木建筑公司冬训班对技术教育的目的认识不明确，在教育计划中提出：“适当地”推广先进经验，以“达到降低成本的目的”。还有的单位把技术教育的方法主要放在讲课上。按照这些单位的情况，就不能贯彻以学习与推广苏联先进经验为主的方针和以实际练习为主、讲课为辅的教学方法。
    又讯：沈阳市第一工程处冬训班采用了适合工人需要的技术教学方法，收到了较好的效果。
    该班第一期，技术教育是从二月十三日开课的。在开课前，有些教员搜集了许多材料，像给学校学生讲课似的编了教材，给混凝土工讲“水化作用”，给油漆工讲“光的性质”，给木工讲“开方”。工人不能接受。大部分教员则毫无准备，只列了几条讲课提纲，有的连提纲也没有。因此，开课以后，不得不变更教学计划，临时给工人讲技术保安、图纸普通常识。领导方面趁此催促教员赶紧编制教材，并提出教材必须切合工人需要。根据这一精神，教员便到工人宿舍邀集老工人和他们讨论自己编的教材，征求意见。电气教员本来要给工人讲电动机原理、变压器原理，工人们说：这些东西是需要学，可惜学习时间短，今年施工中还用不上。教员便根据工人意见修改了教学计划。教员讲一般技术原理缺少具体事例，也请老工人帮助补充。这样编出来的教材，就比较适合工人要求了。
    讲课时，最初碰到的困难是工人技术和文化水平不一致。一般说来，老工人技术高，文化低；青年工人恰好相反。电气教员佟世斌和卜铁汉研究以后，按三、四两级工人的技术和文化程度讲了两次课，全班六十四人中只有六、七人听不清楚，证明这个办法较好。在教学当中，又采取了形象和实物教学的方法。讲授建筑图纸时，工人对剖面、主面等怎么也听不懂，教员便把建筑模型摆出来讲解。工人说：你早这样讲，早就明白啦。学习各种先进经验时，上午在课堂讲解，下午由先进生产者表演，第二天由工人们轮流实习，讨论，总结。给特殊工种的工人讲课时，就搬出各种器械，讲授一般技术原理和实地操作。
    组织技术研究组和学习互助组是贯彻教学计划的好办法。技术研究组是由同一工种各小组内的一级技工组成的，他们帮助学员解答学习中的疑难，向教员反映学习中的问题，提出改进教材内容和教学方法的意见。学习互助组是由两个具有不同的技术和文化水平的工人互相帮助。如电工高凤山今年四十一岁，原来一字不识，但现在学的是一些电工原理，他的徒弟有些文化，于是徒弟教师傅数学，师傅教徒弟技术。现在工人已能用“欧姆定律”计算电功率。徒工的技术已提高到五、六级工的水平。
