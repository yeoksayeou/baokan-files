Seriously Correct Bureaucracy and Commandism
Minister of Posts and Telecommunications of the Central People's Government, Zhu Xuefan

Editor's note: The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications of the Central People's Government convened a meeting of all employees on January 31st, mobilizing all staff to conduct an in-depth review of the operational ideology and leadership style of the postal and telecommunications sector. This article is a report made by Zhu Xuefan, Minister of Posts and Telecommunications, at the meeting.

The deviations and errors that have occurred in the business operations of the postal and telecommunications sector are extremely serious and intolerable. The most serious deviation is commandism, some even developing to the point of using any means necessary. In the original Shanyin Postal and Telecommunications Bureau of Chahar Province, a rural postman divided local residents into three classes in order to promote "North China People," requiring wealthy households to subscribe to three copies, middle-class families to two copies, and the least affluent to one copy. In Leshan County, Sichuan, an old woman received one million yuan remitted by her daughter, and the post office forced her to buy 40,000 yuan worth of books and periodicals. Some places even launched a "deposit one, solicit one, sell one" campaign, such that if one could not "solicit one" or "sell one," mail would not be delivered or money would not be exchanged. Some people even threatened the masses, saying, "Not installing a telephone is not responding to the government's call." This practice created an extremely negative impact among the masses. Originally, the postal and telecommunications business policy focused on letters, distribution, telegrams, and telephones. However, some postal and telecommunications bureaus blindly developed agency purchasing businesses with most of their resources, extensively peddling commodity parcels, forcibly promoting postal cards and stamps, developing return receipts and return postage, especially persuading people to change ordinary letters to registered mail, single registration to double registration, and ordinary telegrams and telephones to urgent telegrams and telephones, in order to increase revenue. Jinzhou County, with a population of only 200,000, planned to sell 400,000 postal cards each month. The Qiqihar Postal and Telecommunications Bureau even changed all thirty-two identical telegrams from the provincial government to urgent. The result was that the main business suffered damage and the quality of work was greatly reduced. Errors in letters, newspapers, telegrams, and telephones, as well as obstacles in telecommunications lines, have increased in many places. The priority of telecommunications was originally divided into military and government, enterprise, and private in that order. Now, some places are giving priority to sending and relaying private telegrams and telephones, while delaying military and government telegrams and telephones, causing significant losses to work.

Many postal and telecommunications bureaus assigned production tasks to employees, forcing them to abandon their own work or go out to develop special businesses on holidays and during rest hours. The Nanchang Postal and Telecommunications Bureau stipulated that every non-sales staff member must sell at least ten postal cards and three newspapers every day. The Changchun Postal and Telecommunications Bureau stipulated that the dozen or so people in the secretariat had to complete the task of installing sixty or seventy telephones. In Anhui, Sichuan, Guizhou, Qinghai, and the original Pingyuan areas, employees were often subjected to wage deductions for failing to complete their "tasks." This seriously affected the work, life, and health of employees.

Although these are only some examples of the deviations and errors in the postal and telecommunications business, they are sufficient to illustrate how seriously they violate laws and regulations, undermine policies, damage the interests of the masses, and damage the prestige of the Party and the government.

The nature of the problem is very serious, and the lessons are very painful. Why did these deviations and errors occur? Why have these deviations and errors developed to such a serious extent? I think there are mainly two aspects:

First, our leading cadres have a serious single-task viewpoint. This is manifested in the fact that we have a certain degree of blindness in formulating production plans, only seeing the over-fulfillment of tasks in the two years of 1950 and 1951, only seeing the huge potential strength of society and the high production enthusiasm of employees. Therefore, when assigning tasks, we unilaterally emphasized ensuring the completion of plans, while neglecting to explain policies, failing to provide specific methods, and failing to conduct timely inspections. More seriously, we sometimes even treated wrong methods as good experiences, promoting them through the Postal and Telecommunications Gazette and the People's Postal and Telecommunications Monthly, which further fueled the development of deviations and errors below. This fully demonstrates that due to the serious single-task viewpoint and the tendency to detach from politics of our leading cadres, the correct patriotic production increase and conservation movement, and the vigorous production enthusiasm of the vast number of employees, were guided in the wrong direction. This is the reason why our leading cadres must bear major responsibility.

Second, there is a serious bureaucratic style in our leadership. Year after year, we have been busy with affairs, mired in official documents, rarely going deep into the lower levels to understand the situation, and rarely studying and discussing reports from below, failing to respond in a timely manner and provide instructions. Many rationalization proposals and advanced experiences have not been well valued, adopted, and promoted. We have insufficient understanding of the characteristics of our enterprise and cannot grasp the laws of its development. Therefore, although some deviations occurred and were discovered as early as last year, we did not recognize their breadth, depth, and harm, thinking they were isolated and accidental, or mistakenly believing they were inevitable phenomena in the development process. Therefore, we did not pay enough attention, failed to correct them effectively, or even accommodated them improperly. Our complacency has produced paralysis. In the past few years, the postal and telecommunications sector has been relatively smooth from takeover to recovery, from production to construction, and has achieved some results. We have been blinded by this situation, unable to see shortcomings, and have developed a mentality of complacency, so that we did not know that such widespread and serious deviations and errors had occurred below. The central government and the Financial and Economic Committee have repeatedly given instructions, but we have not deeply understood them. This fully proves the seriousness of bureaucracy in our leadership.

I myself bear the main responsibility for these serious deviations that have occurred in the business operations of the postal and telecommunications sector. Due to my low political level and poor grasp of policies, I have not deeply studied the business for three years, still floating on the surface, not diving down, not going deep into the field, and relying on signing and issuing official documents to handle affairs, which has resulted in such serious mistakes. This is a very dangerous and very serious bureaucratic style, which I should profoundly examine and thoroughly correct.

Our people's postal and telecommunications enterprise serves national defense construction, economic construction, and cultural construction; our task is to closely link the Party, the government, and the people, as well as the people with each other; our work is in direct contact with the people at all times and is closely related to the interests of the country and the people. Therefore, our responsibility is very great and arduous. We must have a high sense of political responsibility, a strong sense of ownership, and earnestly achieve speed, accuracy, convenience, and safety, and unify political tasks with economic tasks. Only by completing production tasks on the premise of implementing policies is it correct. Our production increase and conservation and economic accounting are built on this foundation; deviating from this foundation will inevitably lead to mistakes.

Therefore, we should concentrate our efforts, resolutely eliminate the single-task viewpoint and the single-profit mentality, and thoroughly correct bureaucracy and the practice of compulsory quotas. Now, most units and employees in the national postal and telecommunications sector have enthusiastically participated in this movement, but some units and leading cadres still believe that there is no problem there, or that the problem is not serious. This is completely wrong. Leading organizations and all employees at all levels across the country should unite, take the lead, fully promote democracy, conduct top-down inspections, and launch bottom-up criticism, to distinguish right from wrong ideologically, draw lessons, and enable everyone to move in the right direction, improve the postal and telecommunications enterprise, and welcome the country's large-scale economic and cultural construction.

    认真纠正官僚主义和强迫命令作风
    中央人民政府邮电部部长  朱学范
    编者按：中央邮电部在一月三十一日召开了全体职工大会，动员全体工作人员深入检查邮电部门的经营思想与领导作风。本文是邮电部朱学范部长在会议上所作的报告。
    邮电部门在业务经营上所发生的偏向和错误是十分严重、不可容忍的。最严重的偏向是强迫命令，有些甚至发展到了不择手段的程度。原察哈尔省山阴邮电局一个乡邮员为了推销“华北人民”，把当地住户分成三等，要有钱的订三份，中等人家订二份，最少的订一份。四川乐山县一个老太太收到她女儿汇来的一百万元，邮电局硬要她买了四万元的书刊。有的地方还开展了“投一、揽一、售一”运动，如不能“揽一”或“售一”，就不投信或不兑款。有的人甚至威胁群众说：“不装电话就是不响应政府的号召。”这种作法在群众中造成了极恶劣的影响。本来邮电业务方针是以信函、发行、电报、电话为主的。但有些邮电局竟以大部力量，盲目发展代购业务，大量兜揽商品包裹，强制推销邮简、邮票，发展回执、回贴，特别是劝人将平信改寄挂号信，单挂号改寄双挂号，将普通电报、电话改为加急电报、电话，以达到增加收入的目的。锦州县只有二十万人口，却计划每月发售四十万个邮简。齐齐哈尔邮电局竟将省府三十二份同文电报全部改为加急。其结果是使主要业务受到损害，并大大降低了工作质量。信函、报刊、电报、电话的差错，以及电信线路的障碍，在不少地方都增加了。电信的轻重缓急，本来是按军政、企业、私人依次划分的，现在有些地方竟尽先拍发、转接私人电报电话，而延误了军政电报电话，使工作受到重大损失。
    许多邮电局给职工摊派生产任务，迫使职工放弃本身工作，或在假日和休息时间，出去发展特种业务。南昌邮电局规定每一个非营业人员每天至少要推销十个邮简、三份报纸。长春邮电局规定秘书科的十几个人要完成六、七十台电话的任务。在安徽、四川、贵州、青海、原平原等地都曾发生过职工完不成“任务”，就扣工资的事情。这就严重地影响了职工的工作、生活和健康。
    虽然这只是邮电业务中的偏向和错误的一些事例，但也足以说明它是如何严重地违背法令，破坏政策，损害了群众的利益及党与政府的威信。
    问题的性质是很严重的，教训是很沉痛的。为什么会产生这些偏向和错误？为什么这些偏向和错误会发展到这样严重的地步呢？我以为主要有下列两方面：
    首先是我们领导干部存在着严重的单纯任务观点。这表现在我们在制订生产计划时带有一定程度的盲目性，只看见一九五○年和一九五一年两年中超额完成了任务，只看见社会的巨大潜在力量和职工的高度生产热情，因此在布置任务时曾片面强调保证完成计划，而忽视了交代政策，没有指示具体方法，也没有进行适时的检查。更严重的是我们有时候还把错误的方法当作好的经验，通过邮电公报、人民邮电月刊加以推广，这就更加助长了下面的偏向和错误的发展。这充分说明了由于我们领导干部有严重的单纯任务观点和脱离政治的倾向，把正确的爱国增产节约运动，把广大职工旺盛的生产热情，引导到错误的方向去了，这是我们领导干部要负重大责任的原因。
    其次是我们领导方面存在着严重的官僚主义作风。我们积年累月，辛辛苦苦，忙于事务，陷于公文中，很少深入下层了解情况，对于下面来的报告也很少研究讨论，不能及时答复和给予指示。对许多合理化建议和先进经验亦未很好重视、采纳与推广。对于本企业的特点认识不足，对于本企业的发展规律掌握不住。因此有些偏向虽然早在去年以前就已产生了，就被发现了，但对于其广度、深度及危害性认识不够，只以为是个别的、偶然的，或者错认为是发展过程中不可避免的现象，因此就重视不够，纠正不力，甚或曲予优容。我们的自满情绪产生了麻痹思想。几年以来，邮电部门从接管到恢复，从生产到建设，都比较顺利，也有些成绩。我们被这种情况蒙蔽住了，看不见缺点，产生了太平观念，以致下面发生了这样普遍、这样严重的偏向和错误还不知道，中央和财委一再指示，还没有深刻理解。这就充分证明我们领导方面官僚主义的严重。
    邮电部门在业务经营方面所发生的这些严重偏向，我本人要负主要责任。由于我的政治水平不高，政策掌握得不好，三年来对业务没有深入钻研，仍旧浮在水面上，没有钻下去，没有深入现场，靠签发公文来办事，结果便造成了这样严重的错误。这是很危险的很严重的官僚主义作风，我应该深刻检讨，彻底改正。
    我们人民邮电企业是为国防建设、经济建设、文化建设服务的；我们的任务是密切党、政府和人民，以及人民与人民之间的联系，我们的工作是时时刻刻都与人民发生直接接触，与国家人民利益息息相关的。因此，我们的责任是非常重大的，艰巨的。我们必需有高度的政治责任感，强烈的主人翁思想，认真作到迅速、准确、方便、安全，把政治任务与经济任务统一起来。只有在贯彻政策的前提下来完成生产任务才是正确的。我们的增产节约、经济核算就是建筑在这个基础之上的，离开这个基础就必定会犯错误。
    因此，我们应该集中全力，坚决肃清单纯任务观点和单纯营利思想，彻底纠正官僚主义与强迫摊派作风。现在全国邮电部门大多数单位及职工都轰轰烈烈地参加了这一运动，但有部分单位及领导干部，还认为他那里没有什么问题，或者问题并不严重。这是完全错误的。全国各级领导机构和全体职工应该一致起来，领导带头，充分发扬民主，进行自上而下的检查，展开自下而上的批评，从思想上分清是非，得出经验教训，使大家都朝着正确的方向前进，搞好邮电企业，迎接国家大规模的经济建设和文化建设。
