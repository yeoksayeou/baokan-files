    Ministry of Heavy Industry Reviews This Year's Capital Construction and Production Plans
    Criticizing Greed for Quick Success and Conservative Ideologies

    [This newspaper reports] The Central Ministry of Heavy Industry, in reviewing the 1953 plan, implemented the policy of grasping the decisive links and leveraging potential strength. In the specific engineering plans for capital construction, it criticized the practice of being greedy for quick success or spending money everywhere, in order to ensure the completion of key construction projects and major engineering works. In the 1953 plan, key investments have been determined for the construction of various major enterprises and for strengthening the capital construction forces and training cadres, accounting for approximately 80% of the total investment. At the same time, construction conditions such as design and construction forces, equipment, and materials were considered more comprehensively. In the production plan, attention was paid to leveraging the potential of enterprises, increasing production, and reducing costs in order to increase capital accumulation for national industrialization. The conservative view of setting low plans and "pleasantly" exceeding them without effort was opposed. Therefore, the vast majority of important product plans met or exceeded the state's requirements. The total output value of the 1953 plan increased by 25.6% compared to 1952, labor productivity increased by 14.7%, the cost reduction rate exceeded the state's requirements, and technical and economic norms were also improved.

    In reviewing the plan, it was found that there were two deviations in determining the engineering projects for capital construction in various units:

    First, in the allocation of investment, in addition to the main construction projects, various units also proposed many projects that were optional or could be postponed. From an overall perspective, these needed to be reduced. However, some people even became emotional about this. When reducing investment, some units even proposed reducing the main projects and retaining the non-main projects, attempting to request "additional" investment for the main projects in the future. Some units even anticipated that the proposed projects would not be approved, but still had to propose them to "try it out." Some even included projects that were originally decided not to be done in the plan. The above-mentioned erroneous practices were corrected during the plan review.

    Second, when determining the investment for construction units, some people only one-sidedly emphasized the necessity of a certain project, while not giving sufficient consideration to the possible conditions for completing the project, especially the research on resources, transportation, power, design, and production-sales balance. They even had little understanding of the situation of the construction unit. For example, the Southwest Steel Bureau proposed building the iron-smelting furnace of Factory 101 before the iron ore resource problem was resolved. The Building Materials Industry Bureau proposed building a mechanical and electrical repair factory in the Northeast, but did not give good consideration to the design forces, and had to cut this project when balancing the design forces. If such projects that were greedy for quick success, only estimating needs and not estimating possibilities, were included in the national plan, it would inevitably lead to the accumulation or even waste of a large amount of national funds, which would be very detrimental to national economic construction.

    In reviewing the production plan, it was also found that cadres at all levels still had incorrect understandings regarding the exploration of potential, especially the exploration of the reserve forces of enterprises, to increase accumulation and prepare funds for national industrialization. This was mainly manifested in three aspects:

    First, in terms of labor productivity and the number of employees, all enterprise units wanted to increase personnel and did not pay attention to increasing existing labor productivity. For example, the output of pig iron at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant in 1953 increased by 14.8% compared to 1952, but it wanted to increase the number of employees by 49.8%. Some people used the excuse that "the proportion of wages in the cost of heavy industry enterprises is not large, and employing more people is in line with the current need to train a large number of personnel" to request an increase in workers. In reality, most of the personnel that these enterprises wanted to increase were in auxiliary departments and non-production personnel, while the number of skilled workers who were truly trained to meet production needs was small. Some people also emphasized that "to improve labor productivity, a large amount of mechanization investment is needed, otherwise we can only increase personnel." They did not realize that there were many unreasonable aspects in labor organization. The revised 1953 plan powerfully illustrates this fact: it is entirely possible and necessary to start by improving labor organization to improve labor productivity. For example, Anshan Iron and Steel was able to ensure the completion of production tasks with fewer additional people after mobilization by the leadership.

    Second, there were also incorrect understandings in terms of raw material consumption and reserves. Enterprise units and management departments at all levels have not yet thoroughly and meticulously grasped and managed the raw material consumption quotas, which generally affect about 70% of the cost, and the raw material reserve quotas, which affect the circulating funds of enterprises. The planning department did not pay attention to it, the production department did not care about costs, the technical department did not think of ways to reduce consumption quotas or find substitutes, and the supply department only sought "insurance," so that from the initial plan, many consumption quotas in 1953 were actually increased. For example, the metal consumption quota for steelmaking at Anshan Iron and Steel was 1.07 in the production plan, 1.09 in the supply plan, but in reality, it only needed 1.05, and it was only reversed during the plan revision. This one item alone could save the state 20 billion yuan. The planned reserve of pyrite and ferromanganese at Anshan Iron and Steel was set at more than one year. This kind of "insurance" reserve accumulated a large amount of useful materials and funds, which could not be used in a timely manner where the state needed them most.

    Third, in terms of cost reduction and financial revenue and expenditure, it can also be seen that many people have not conducted in-depth and specific research on whether various expenses are reasonable and carefully calculated to explore potential. In fact, the potential in this area is great. For example, after analysis, the cost plan for various heavy industries could save more than 100 billion yuan in enterprise management fees and workshop expenses alone. Some enterprises also incorrectly increased the prices of materials without allocation prices and unrealistically increased transportation and miscellaneous expenses. For example, the Dalian Alkali Plant's transportation and miscellaneous expenses for each sack of soda ash supplied by the local sack factory were actually listed as 4,000 yuan, but only 2,000 yuan was actually needed. This item alone could save 5 to 6 billion yuan. The transportation and miscellaneous expenses for pit wood used by the Benxi Coal Mine were approximately 380,000 yuan per cubic meter, which was more than 200,000 yuan more than actually needed. This phenomenon is inseparable from the lack of attention paid by leaders at all levels to the issue of enterprise economic accounting.

    Now the review of the Ministry's 1953 plan has ended, and the greed for quick success in the specific engineering plans for capital construction and the conservative ideology in the production plan have been initially corrected. However, to truly implement the plan, it is still necessary for enterprise management departments and enterprise units to attach importance to mobilizing the masses to discuss and make the plan be grasped by the masses, so that the plan approved by the state can play a guiding role in actual work.

### 重工业部审查今年基本建设和生产计划  批判贪多冒进和保守思想

    重工业部审查今年基本建设和生产计划
    批判贪多冒进和保守思想
    【本报讯】中央重工业部在审查一九五三年计划中，贯彻了抓住决定环节、发挥潜在力量的方针，在基本建设的具体工程计划中，批判了贪多冒进或到处花钱的做法，以便保证重点建设和主要工程的完成。在一九五三年的计划中，已确定各主要企业的工程建设及为壮大基本建设力量、培养干部等重点投资，约占总投资的百分之八十。同时较周密地考虑了设计、施工力量及设备、材料等建设条件。在生产计划中注意到发挥企业潜力，提高生产，降低成本，以便为国家工业化增加资金积累；反对把计划订低、不费气力就可“愉快地”超过计划的保守观点，因此绝大多数的重要产品计划都达到或超过国家的要求。一九五三年的计划总产值，比一九五二年上涨百分之二十五点六，劳动生产率提高百分之十四点七，成本降低率超过了国家的要求，技术经济定额也有改进。
    在审查计划中，发现各单位在确定基本建设的工程项目时，存在两种偏向：
    第一，在投资的分配中，各单位除主要的建设项目外，还提出了很多可办可不办的或可缓办的项目。从整体来看，需要削减。然而就有人甚至为此闹情绪。在削减投资时，有些单位甚至提出削减主要项目，保留非主要项目，企图将来再要求“追加”主要项目的投资；也有的单位事先已估计到提出的工程不可能被批准，但还得提出来“试一试”；甚至有人把原来决定不做的项目，也列入计划。上述这些错误的做法都在审查计划中得到纠正。
    第二，在确定建设单位的投资时，有些人只片面地强调了某项工程的必要性，而对于完成该项工程的可能条件则考虑不周，特别是对资源、交通、动力、设计、产销平衡等问题的研究很不够，甚至对于建设单位的情况都很少了解。如西南钢铁局在铁矿资源问题未解决前，便提出建设一○一厂的炼铁炉。建筑材料工业局提出要在东北建设一个机电修配厂，但没有很好地考虑设计力量，在平衡设计力量时才不得不把这项工程削掉。这种贪多冒进、只估计需要不估计可能的项目如果列入国家计划，必然积压甚至浪费国家大量资金，对国家经济建设是十分不利的。
    在审查生产计划中，还发现了各级干部对于发掘潜力、特别是发掘企业的后备力量以增加积累，为国家工业化准备资金，还存在着不正确的认识。这主要表现在三方面：
    第一，在劳动生产率及职工人数上，各企业单位都想多增加人，不注意提高现有的劳动生产率。如石景山钢铁厂一九五三年的生铁产量比一九五二年增加百分之十四点八，但要增加职工人数百分之四十九点八。有些人以“重工业企业中的工资在成本中所占比重不大，多用几个人正符合目前大量培养人员的需要”为借口要求增加工人，实际上这些企业要增加的人员，多半是辅助部门和非生产人员，真正为适合生产需要而培养的技术工人却是少数。还有些人强调“要提高劳动生产率，就要大量的机械化投资，否则只有增加人员。”他们没有认识到在劳动组织中存在着很多不合理的地方。修正后的一九五三年计划就有力地说明了这个事实：先从改善劳动组织入手来提高劳动生产率，在目前是完全可能而且是必要的。如鞍钢就是在领导上动员以后，少增加人仍可保证生产任务的完成。
    第二，在原材料的消耗及储备方面，也存在着不正确的认识。企业单位及各级管理部门，还没有深入细致地把一般影响成本百分之七十左右的原材料消耗定额与左右企业流动资金的原材料储备定额，很好地掌握管理起来。计划部门不重视，生产部门不计工本，技术部门不想办法降低消耗定额或找代用品，供应部门但求“保险”，以致从初步计划上看，一九五三年很多的消耗定额反而提高了。例如鞍钢炼钢的金属消耗定额，在生产计划中为一点○七，在供应计划中列一点○九，而实际上只要一点○五，在修正计划时才扭转过来。只此一项，就可替国家节约二百亿元。鞍钢的硫化铁、锰铁计划储备量，规定在一年以上；这种“保险”储备，就把大量有用的物质与资金积压起来，不能及时利用到国家最需要的地方去。
    第三，在成本降低及财务收支方面，也看出不少人没有深入具体研究各种费用是否合理，精打细算发掘潜力。事实上，这方面的潜力是很大的。例如重工业各业成本计划，经过分析后，仅企业管理费、车间经费就可节省千亿元以上。还有些企业不正确地提高了没有调拨价格的物资价格，不切实际地加大运杂费开支。如大连碱厂包装纯碱用麻袋由当地麻袋厂供给，但该厂把每支麻袋的运杂费竟列为四千元，实际只需要两千元，仅此一项即可节省五十至六十亿元。本溪煤矿用坑木，每立方公尺运杂费约合三十八万元，比实际需要多列二十余万元。这种现象与各级领导对于企业的经济核算问题的不重视是分不开的。
    现在该部一九五三年计划审核工作已经结束，基本建设具体工程计划中的贪多冒进和生产计划中的保守思想得到了初步的纠正。但真正使计划贯彻下去，还需要各企业管理部门、企业单位重视发动群众讨论，使计划为群众掌握，这样才能使国家批准的计划在实际工作中起指导作用。
