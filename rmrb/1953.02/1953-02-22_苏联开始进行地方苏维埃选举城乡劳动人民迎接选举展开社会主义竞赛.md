Xinhua News Agency, February 21st: Moscow dispatch: The local Soviet elections in seven Union Republics, including the Russian Federation, will be held on the 22nd. The preparatory work for the elections of more than 82,000 local Soviets in districts, states, autonomous regions, regions, towns, villages, and residential areas in the sixteen Union Republics of the Soviet Union has been completed or is nearing completion. In the approximately two months since the Supreme Soviets of these Union Republics promulgated the election decisions in late December 1952, the Soviet people have carried out the establishment of electoral districts, voter registration, nomination of candidates for Soviet representatives, registration of candidates, meetings between candidates and voters, publicity on the experiences and achievements of candidates, and propaganda and mobilization work related to the elections, as well as socialist emulation activities launched for the elections.

	At the construction site of the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Power Station, one of the great communist construction projects, a large red banner is hung on the front of the beautifully decorated "Hydraulic Machinery Management Office of Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Project":

	"Hydroelectric Project Builders, let's all participate in the local Soviet elections on February 22nd!" The office of the residential district Soviet has been very busy these days, with voters and representative candidates constantly coming and going. Klimoshkin, the chairman of the residential district Soviet, said: "The election campaign has brought even more vitality to our already busy lives." Construction teams on the construction site have been exceeding their plans to greet the elections. The local Soviet representative candidate, driver Lomakin, the road opener Garinin, the work team leaders Sharov and Volkova, and the excavator operator Nagaev are particularly outstanding, and they have all achieved particularly high labor productivity, fully demonstrating the spirit of the outstanding sons and daughters of the Soviet Union. As dusk falls on this construction site, a sea of lights forms on the left bank of the Volga River, and propagandists are working hard everywhere. In the propaganda station, the lights illuminate the house brightly. Many voters gathered here to listen to lectures on the elections. Propagandists, like those in other parts of the Soviet Union, explained to the audience the resolutions of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Comrade Stalin's classic work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR," the Soviet election law, the achievements of peaceful labor and the improvement of material and cultural living standards in the Soviet Union, and the struggle for world peace. Because many voters cannot come to the propaganda station, the propagandists go to their homes to talk to them individually. Voters always give these enthusiastic propagandists a warm welcome. In their conversations, propagandists and voters often compare the past with the present. Two years ago, when the local Soviet elections were held, the place where the new port of the future Zhiguli Sea is currently being built was still a village with only fifty collective farm households. Today, a new city for hydroelectric builders, "Komsomol City," is growing up here. The population here is already in the tens of thousands, and the urban area is constantly expanding. Beautiful houses line both sides of Stalin Avenue. Soon, after the scaffolding is removed, the buildings of the museum, bank, post office, telegraph office, and so on will appear before people's eyes. In the place near the coast of Zhiguli, on Pioneer Street, a cultural and recreation park will be built. Propagandists and voters also talked about the problems that the elected Soviets need to solve: such as city gasification, the work of shops, public canteens, bathhouses, hairdressing, and other public utilities. In addition, propagandists also organized meetings between Soviet representative candidates and voters. For example, not long ago, the state Soviet representative candidate, the famous driver Lomakin, and the district Soviet representative candidate, the famous excavator operator Doshaev, met with voters at the club here, with more than 500 people attending.

	In the mines, at the "Mintovka" No. 4-5 mine in Gorlovka, Ukraine, miners have been continuously overfulfilling their plans for the elections since the beginning of the new year. The miners have also decided to complete the February plan by February 22nd to welcome the elections. This mine has two hundred propagandists who carry out propaganda work to voters every day. Propagandists often combine vivid examples from the region to carry out propaganda to voters. Propagandist Baulshakov said to the voters: "Two years ago, in the place where you and I live now, there were only two or three houses in total. Since then, eighteen multi-room houses, as well as cultural palaces, schools, kindergartens, nurseries, shops, and pharmacies, have been built one after another." Other propagandists said: In 1951, the first coal mining combine for steeply inclined coal seams appeared in this mine. Since then, many miners have become machine operators. In the past year, the entire mine produced 42,000 tons of high-quality coal more than planned for the state. Due to the increase in wages, miners have bought twenty-six cars and one hundred motorcycles in the past two years, and nearly fifty miners have built private houses.

	In the countryside, in Petrovsky Village, Kuibyshev Oblast, a socialist emulation campaign is vigorously underway to complete all spring plowing preparations before the election day. Propagandists often report on the competition situation and carry out mobilization at symposiums for these voters. After nightfall, after the end of the working day, bright electric lights shine from the windows of every household. The village radio station broadcasts to the residents that a voter meeting will be held in the cultural palace, and a drama will be performed after the meeting; the library will hold lectures. More than 350 propagandists are conducting propaganda to voters at propaganda stations and other places, combined with the specific situation of the village. The village has established a wide education network, and now there are a total of eighteen ordinary schools and twelve specialized schools, as well as many collective farmer training classes. Last year, the grain harvest per hectare of all three collective farms here was more than one hundred poods. In the future, after the arid land here is irrigated with water from the Kuban-Karaus River irrigation system, the yield will definitely be further increased, and the material and cultural life of the people here will also be further improved.

	In the far-flung regions, on the Kamchatka Peninsula in the Far East, election preparations are also being carried out intensely. Because many residential areas are far from the central area, one of the characteristics here is the large-scale use of communication tools. The state post office sent a large number of election documents and materials about the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union to remote locations in postal packages. In the Koryak National District, special ski teams and reindeer sled transportation teams were also organized to send election materials to remote residential areas. Another characteristic is that propagandists go to remote areas for ski propaganda tours and talk to voters about various aspects of the local Soviet elections.

	Xinhua News Agency, February 21st: TASS Moscow dispatch on the 20th: The local Soviet elections in Moscow will be held on the 22nd. The buildings of the various polling places have been decorated very beautifully, and the entrances have been decorated with lights. The Moscow Stalin electoral district is decorated particularly splendidly, where Comrade Stalin, the great leader of the Soviet state, will be elected. The various propaganda stations appear very active. Propagandists tell voters about the great achievements of the Soviet people, the wise domestic and foreign policies of Lenin and Stalin, and the struggle for peace and friendship among the peoples of all countries. The citizens of Moscow enthusiastically participate in various lectures and symposiums, and everyone talks about the reconstruction of Moscow and the tremendous changes that have taken place in the capital during the past few Stalin Five-Year Plans. More than 7,000 Moscow Oblast, city, and district Soviet representative candidates have registered in the various electoral districts of Moscow. Among them are many famous production innovators, scientists, teachers, and cultural workers, who have all won the trust of voters with their honest labor and active social and political activities.

    苏联开始进行地方苏维埃选举城乡劳动人民迎接选举展开社会主义竞赛
    【新华社二十一日讯】莫斯科消息：苏联俄罗斯联邦等七个加盟共和国的地方苏维埃选举将在二十二日举行。苏联十六个加盟共和国八万二千多个边疆区、州、专区、区、市镇、乡村和居住区等地方苏维埃的选举筹备工作已经相继结束或即将结束。自从一九五二年十二月下旬这些加盟共和国最高苏维埃颁布选举决定以来约两个月当中，苏联人民进行了成立选区、选民登记、苏维埃代表候选人提名、候选人登记、候选人与选民见面、候选人的经历功绩的宣传、以及有关选举的宣传鼓动工作和为选举展开的社会主义竞赛活动。
    在伟大的共产主义建设工程之一——古比雪夫水力发电站建设工地，装璜华美的“古比雪夫水力工程水力机械管理处”大厦正面挂着大幅红色标语：
    “水力工程建设者们，二月二十二日大家去参加地方苏维埃选举！”住宅区苏维埃的办公处这些天来非常繁忙，选民们和代表候选人们不断地进进出出。住宅区苏维埃主席克利莫希金说：“选举运动替我们已经很紧张的生活带来了更大的生气。”工地建设者们的工作队为迎接选举，纷纷超额完成计划。地方苏维埃代表候选人汽车司机洛马金、开路机手加里宁、工作队长沙洛夫和伏尔科娃、掘土机手奈加耶夫更是出类拔萃，他们都达到了特别高的劳动生产率，充分表现了苏维埃优秀儿女的精神。每当暮色降临到这个工地的时候，伏尔加河左岸形成了一片电灯的光海，宣传员们在各处紧张地活动着。在鼓动站，灯光把房子照得通亮。许许多多的选民聚集在这里，听有关选举的讲演。宣传员们像苏联其他各地一样向听众讲解苏联共产党第十九次代表大会的决议、斯大林同志的经典著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”、苏联选举法、苏联和平劳动的成就和物质文化生活水平的提高、以及争取世界和平的斗争。因为有许多选民不可能到鼓动站来，宣传员便到他们的住处去，和他们个别交谈。选民们对于这些热情的宣传员总是给以亲切的欢迎。宣传员们和选民们在谈话中时常把过去和现在作对比。两年前举行地方苏维埃选举的时候，在那目前正在建筑未来日古里海的新港的地方，还是一个只有五十家集体农户的村庄。如今，这里一个水力建设者的新城“青年团城”正在成长起来。这里居民已是数以万计了，而且城区还在不断扩大。斯大林大街的两边排列着漂亮的房子。再过不久，鹰架拆去后，博物馆、银行、邮局、电报局等等大厦就会突现在人们的眼前。在靠近日古里海岸的地方，在少先队大街，将建设起一个文化休息公园，宣传员和选民还谈到将要选出的苏维埃需要解决的问题：如城市煤气化、商店的工作、公共食堂、澡堂、理发和其他公用事业的问题。此外宣传员们还组织苏维埃代表候选人和选民见面会谈。例如不久前，州苏维埃代表候选人、著名的司机洛马金和区苏维埃代表候选人、著名的掘土机手多沙耶夫就在这里的俱乐部和选民们见了面，到会的有五百多人。
    在矿场，在乌克兰高尔罗夫卡的“民托夫卡”四—五号矿场，从新年一开始，矿工们就为了选举不断超额完成计划。矿工们并已决定在二月二十二日完成二月份计划，以此迎接选举。这一个矿场有两百个宣传员天天向选民进行宣传工作。宣传员常常结合本地区的生动实例向选民进行宣传。宣传员鲍尔夏柯夫向选民说：“两年前，在我和大家现在住的地方，一共只有两三座房子。从那时起，十八座多间住房以及文化宫、学校、幼儿园、托儿所、商店、药房一个个建立起来了。”别的宣传员说：一九五一年这个矿场出现了第一架急倾斜煤层用的采煤联合机，从那时起，许多矿工都变成了机器操使者了。过去一年，全矿场为国家超计划多生产了四万二千吨优质煤。由于工资的增加，矿工们在过去两年中，买了二十六辆汽车、一百辆摩托车，差不多有五十个矿工建造了私人住宅。
    在乡间，在古比雪夫州彼得罗夫斯基村，争取在选举日前做好全部春耕准备工作的社会主义竞赛蓬勃地进行着。宣传员经常在座谈会上向这些选民报告竞赛情况和进行鼓动。入夜以后，劳动日结束了，家家户户的窗眼里都射出明亮的电灯光。村无线电站向居民们广播说：文化宫中将要举行选民会议，会后将上演戏剧；图书馆将举行讲演。三百五十多个宣传员们在鼓动站以及其他各处，结合该村的具体情况向选民进行宣传。该村已建立起广泛的教育网，现在共有十八个普通学校和十二个专门学校以及许多集体农民训练班。去年此地全部三个集体农庄每公顷的谷物收获量是一百多普特。将来用库班—卡拉乌斯河灌溉系统的水灌溉这里的干旱土地以后，产量必将进一步提高，此地人民的物质和文化生活也必将随着进一步提高。
    在极边远的地方，在远东的堪察加半岛，选举准备工作也在紧张地进行着。由于许多居民区离中心地区很远，所以这里的特色之一是大量使用通讯工具。州邮局将大批选举文件和关于苏联共产党第十九次代表大会的材料用邮包送往边远地点。在柯里亚斯基民族专区还组织了特别的滑雪队和鹿狗车运输队，把有关选举的材料送往边远的居民区。另一个特色是，宣传员们到边远地方进行滑雪巡回宣传，就地方苏维埃选举的各方面和选民进行谈话。
    【新华社二十一日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科二十日讯：莫斯科的地方苏维埃选举二十二日就要举行了。各个投票处大厦都已布置得十分漂亮，大门前都已装上灯彩。莫斯科斯大林选区，布置得特别富丽堂皇，苏维埃国家的伟大领袖斯大林同志将在这里受选。各个鼓动站显得十分活跃。宣传员向选民讲述苏联人民的伟大成就，讲述英明的列宁—斯大林的内政外交政策，讲述为和平和各国人民的友谊的斗争。莫斯科的市民们兴致勃勃地参加各种讲演会和座谈会，大家谈论着莫斯科的改建和首都在过去几个斯大林五年计划里所发生的巨大改变。莫斯科各选区已有七千多莫斯科州、市、区苏维埃代表候选人登了记。其中有许多著名的生产革新者、科学家、教师、文化工作者，他们都以诚实的劳动和积极的社会政治活动而获得了选民们的信任。
