Fellow Chairman and Committee Members:

I fully agree with the reports of Vice Chairman Zhou, Vice Chairman Chen, and Head of Delegation Guo, and I warmly support Vice Chairman Zhou's call to complete the three major current tasks and strive for their complete realization!

Under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, the Chinese people have successfully completed various reforms and restoration work in the past three years, achieving great accomplishments and creating conditions for planned and large-scale national construction. We have now entered a new era unprecedented in history. This year will mark the beginning of the first Five-Year Plan, further realization of democratization, and continued strengthening of the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea. The people of the whole country will further unleash their enthusiasm for labor and creativity and march forward with unparalleled excitement to win great and glorious victories!

The Southwest region was liberated relatively late and suffered insane destruction by Chiang Kai-shek's defeated troops, a large number of secret agents, and millions of bandits, leaving it in ruins. In the three years since then, thanks to the correct leadership of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government and the joint efforts of the broad masses, the Southwest region has undergone various reforms and restoration work, resulting in fundamental changes.

In the early days of liberation, we first implemented the suppression of bandits, opposition to local bullies, and suppression of counter-revolutionaries. In less than a year, we wiped out the bandits and severely cracked down on bandit leaders, despots, secret agents, and counter-revolutionaries, laying the foundation for revolutionary order and bringing unprecedented stability to cities and villages, paving the way for various reforms.

Land reform was launched on the basis of this suppression of bandits, opposition to local bullies, and rent reduction and interest deposit refunds. Starting in 1951, land reform was carried out in areas inhabited by approximately 84 million people, accounting for 92 percent of the total population of the region, and follow-up review work was conducted successively. Land reform has been basically completed throughout the region. As a result, rural productive forces have been liberated, farmers' political consciousness and enthusiasm for production have been stimulated, rural people's political power and militia armed forces have been established, and more than 800,000 regular and seasonal labor mutual aid groups have been organized, bringing together more than 20 percent of the rural labor force throughout the region. Mutual aid and cooperation movements have been launched on a large scale, and agricultural production cooperatives have been steadily promoted. Generally, efforts have been made to practice intensive cultivation, strive for high yields, and last year we concentrated our efforts to overcome the spring drought, achieving the task of increasing agricultural production by 5 percent across the region. Agricultural production has exceeded the highest annual output before the war, and farmers have a large surplus of grain to sell in exchange for needed means of production and means of livelihood, giving the countryside a thriving new look.

The Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea movement, which began successively with land reform, as well as participation in the army, donations, support for the army and preferential treatment for families of soldiers, the signing of patriotic pacts, and the peace signature movement, have deeply educated the people of the entire Southwest region in patriotism and internationalism, making them more motivated and becoming a powerful driving force for various tasks and movements.

The Southwest's industrial and mining enterprises, which suffered serious damage, were rapidly restored and then underwent democratic reform. Relying on workers, improving factory management, promoting advanced experience, advocating rationalization proposals, and increasing labor efficiency have led to increased output year by year, with major industries far exceeding the highest annual output before liberation. In terms of transportation, we completed the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, which the people of the Southwest had been looking forward to for forty years, extended the arduous Kangding-Tibet Highway to Qamdo, and repaired inland waterway transportation. Industrial, mining, and transportation enterprises have also been fully restored and are developing forward.

The thriving exchange of goods between urban and rural areas, the stability of prices, and the fundamental improvement of finance and economy have improved the material and cultural living standards of the people. The vigorous "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements have increased the understanding, strengthened discipline, and changed the social atmosphere of state personnel and people of all strata.

In the field of culture and education, we have also launched ideological remolding of teachers and staff, enlightened the political consciousness of the vast number of teachers, students, and staff, and improved teacher-student relations and teaching methods. Cultural and educational undertakings have developed rapidly, with 50 percent of school-age children in the region now enrolled in school, and the number of students in universities, colleges, and secondary schools is also increasing year by year. Various cultural activities have penetrated into the military, factories, rural areas, and small and medium-sized cities, and are deeply welcomed by the masses. Mass patriotic health campaigns have greatly improved people's health conditions.

These movements were all carried out by fully mobilizing the masses, and they all concentratedly expressed the will of the people and met the needs of the people, which laid the foundation for the construction of democratic political power. The vast majority of the region's more than 19,000 townships have convened peasant representative conferences or township people's representative conferences and elected township people's governments. Provinces, counties, and cities have generally convened people's representative conferences from all walks of life, and six cities and eighty-eight counties have exercised the functions and powers of people's congresses. Various ethnic minorities in the Southwest are united in the big family of the motherland, and have established 126 ethnic autonomous regions equivalent to special districts, counties, districts, and townships, and more than 380 ethnic democratic joint governments at all levels. The convening of people's representative conferences at all levels and from all walks of life has strengthened the unity of the people, promoted the central tasks of each period, and demonstrated the superiority of the people's democratic system.

Although some difficulties and shortcomings have occurred in the process of various tasks, fortunately they have been successively completed, making it possible to join the people of the whole country in welcoming new and great tasks.

Major and urgent glorious tasks have been placed before us. In the future, we should more closely unite all ethnic groups, all democratic classes, all democratic parties, and people from all walks of life, and under the centralized leadership of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, strive with full confidence for the victorious completion of the three major tasks.

    政协全国委员会委员
    熊克武的发言主席，各位委员：
    我完全同意周副主席、陈副主席、郭副团长的报告，并热烈拥护周副主席完成当前三大任务的号召，为其彻底实现而奋斗！
    中国人民在毛主席和共产党的英明领导下，三年来的努力，胜利地完成了各项改革与恢复工作，取得了伟大的成就，为有计划的、大规模的国家建设创造了条件。现已进入历史上从来未有的新时期，今年便开始第一个五年计划，并进一步实现民主化，继续加强抗美援朝斗争；全国人民将更发挥劳动的积极性与创造性、无比兴奋地为争取伟大而光荣的胜利向前奋进！
    西南为解放较迟的地区，遭受蒋匪帮败残军队及大批特务与成百万土匪疯狂的破坏，而残破不堪。三年以来，由于毛主席及中央人民政府正确的领导和广大人民共同的努力，西南地区进行了各项改革与恢复工作，有了根本的改变。
    在解放初期，首先实行清匪、反霸与镇压反革命运动，不到一年，即将土匪肃清，严重地打击了匪首、恶霸、特务、反革命分子，奠定了革命秩序，使城市与乡村空前安定，为各项改革铺平了道路。
    土地改革便在这清匪、反霸及减租、退押基础上展开的。自一九五一年开始，在约占全区总人口百分之九十二的八千四百万人口地区进行了土地改革，并陆续作了复查工作。全区土地改革已基本完成。因而，解放了农村生产力，激发了农民的政治觉悟与生产积极性，建立了农村人民政权与民兵武装，组织了经常性与季节性的劳动互助组达八十余万个，使全区百分之二十以上的农民劳动力组织起来，大量地展开了互助合作运动，稳步地推行了农业生产合作社。一般做到了精耕细作，争取丰产，去年更集中力量战胜了春旱，达成了去年度全区农业爱国增产百分之五的任务。农业生产已超过战前最高年产量，农民有大量剩余粮食出卖以换取所需的生产资料与生活资料，使农村呈现欣欣向荣的新气象。
    与土地改革相继开始的抗美援朝运动。以及参军、捐献、拥军优属、订立爱国公约及和平签名运动，使西南全区人民深刻地受到了爱国主义与国际主义的教育而更加奋发，成为各项工作与运动的强大的推动力量。
    遭受严重破坏的西南工矿事业在迅速恢复后，进行了民主改革。依靠工人，改善工厂管理，推广先进经验，提倡合理化建议，增强劳动效率，使产量逐年增加，各主要工业远超过解放前最高年产量。在交通事业方面我们完成了西南人民四十年来所盼望的成渝铁路，将工程艰巨的康藏公路修达昌都，并修整了内河航运。工矿交通事业也已完全恢复，并向前发展了。
    城乡物资交流的畅旺，物价的稳定和财政经济的根本好转，这就增进了人民物质与文化生活的水平。雷厉风行的“三反”“五反”运动，使国家工作人员与各阶层人民提高了认识，严肃了纪律，改变了社会风气。
    在文教方面，我们亦展开了教职员的思想改造，启发了广大师生员工的政治觉悟，改善了师生关系与教学方法。文化教育事业已有迅速发展，全区百分之五十的学龄儿童已经入学，大专及中级学校学生也是逐年增加。各种文化活动已深入部队、工厂、农村及中小城市，并深受群众的欢迎。群众性的爱国卫生运动，大大地改善了人民的卫生状况。
    这些运动都是充分发动群众来进行的，都是集中地表现了人民的意志，满足了人民的要求，这便有基础展开民主政权的建设。全区一万九千多个乡，绝大部分都已召开农民代表会议或乡人民代表会议，选举了乡人民政府；省、县、市一般都召开过各界人民代表会议，已有六个市、八十八个县，代行了人民代表大会职权。西南各少数民族团结在祖国大家庭中，已经建立相当于专区、县、区、乡的民族自治区一百二十六个及各级民族民主联合政府三百八十余个。各级各界人民代表会议的召开，加强了人民的团结，推动了各时期的中心任务，表露出人民民主制度的优越性。
    各项工作在进行中虽发生了一些困难与缺点，幸皆依次告成，使有可能与全国人民一起来迎接新的伟大任务。
    重大而迫切的光荣任务已摆在我们的面前，今后当更加紧密地团结各民族、各民主阶级、各民主党派及各界人民，在毛主席及中央人民政府集中领导下，满怀信心地争取三大任务的胜利完成。
