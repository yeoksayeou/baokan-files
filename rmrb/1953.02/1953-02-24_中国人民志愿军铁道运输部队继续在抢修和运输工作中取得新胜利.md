    Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, February 23rd: Reporter Yin Bushi reports: The Chinese People's Volunteer Army Railway Transportation Troops continue to achieve new successes in repair and transportation work, and have been commended in a circular by the Volunteer Army leadership.
    According to incomplete statistics, since the beginning of January this year, the enemy has dispatched an average of more than 200 sorties per day to repeatedly carry out key bombings of railways and stations in North Korea. The total number of bombs dropped by enemy aircraft in January this year increased by two times compared to the highest month last year. In the intervals between bombings, enemy aircraft also continuously harassed, attempting to obstruct our army's repair work. However, with high degrees of heroism and wisdom, the Volunteer Army railway troops continuously repaired railways and bridges day and night, thwarting the enemy's frantic bombing attempts to cut off our army's railway transportation lines.
    Pan Chengzhong, the company commander of a certain unit, was leading his troops to carry out repairs in a certain area when he suffered serious head and waist injuries due to the explosion of a time bomb. However, as soon as he woke up from his coma, he shouted, "Comrades, hurry up and repair! Strive for time to ensure smooth railway traffic!" At this time, his entire cotton uniform was soaked with blood, and the deputy company commander persuaded him to leave the scene, but he refused. He gritted his teeth and lay on the ground, continuing to direct the troops to carry out repair work. Inspired by his heroic actions, the soldiers actively carried out repair work with high courage and wisdom under the threat of time bomb explosions, and finally completed the task ahead of schedule, allowing trains to pass smoothly in an endless stream.
    The soldiers of the ninth company of a certain unit built bridge foundations in ice water more than one meter deep. Their clothes froze into ice tubes, their skin turned purple from the cold, and their hands and feet were broken, with blood staining the ice red. However, they still insisted on completing nine hours of work.
    The famous Yang Lian Di Company, while performing the task of repairing and backfilling earthwork at a certain station, found that the frozen soil was as hard as rock due to the severe cold. A single pickaxe could only remove a small thin piece. Therefore, the soldiers actively used their brains and created new methods such as "peeling and hollowing," "continuous grass bags," and "continuous earthwork." Using these methods, they dug 380 cubic meters of earth in one day with only 110 people, completing the task three days ahead of schedule.
    Although enemy aircraft have done everything possible to bomb and destroy the railway transportation lines in North Korea this year, the Volunteer Army Railway Transportation Troops have not only completed the January 1953 military transportation plan as scheduled, but have also created the highest record in transportation efficiency.
    The leadership organ of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army issued a circular to commend the glorious achievements of the Volunteer Army Railway Transportation Troops in repair and transportation work, calling on the railway transportation troops to continue to carry forward the spirit of courage and tenacity and strive for greater victories!

### 中国人民志愿军铁道运输部队继续在抢修和运输工作中取得新胜利

    中国人民志愿军铁道运输部队继续在抢修和运输工作中取得新胜利
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十三日电】本社记者殷步实报道：中国人民志愿军铁道运输部队继续在抢修和运输工作中取得新的成就，受到志愿军领导机关的通报表扬。
    据不完全统计，今年一月上旬以来，敌人平均每天出动二百架次以上飞机对北朝鲜铁路和车站反复施行重点轰炸。今年一月份敌机投弹的总数比去年最高月份增加了两倍。在轰炸的间隙，敌机又不断进行袭扰，企图阻挠我军的抢修工作。但是，志愿军铁道部队以高度的英勇和智慧，不分昼夜地连续进行抢修铁路和桥梁，使敌人妄图截断我军铁道运输线的疯狂轰炸遭到了失败。
    某部一连连长潘成忠带领部队在某地进行抢修时，因定时炸弹爆炸，头部和腰部都负了重伤。但他刚从昏迷中苏醒过来时就高呼：“同志们赶快抢修啊！争取时间保证铁路畅通！”这时，他全身棉衣都被鲜血浸透，副连长劝他下现场，他拒绝了，他咬紧牙关躺在地上，继续指挥部队进行抢修工作。在他这种英雄行为的感召下，战士们以高度的勇气与智慧，在定时炸弹爆炸的威胁下积极进行抢修工作，终于提前完成了任务，使列车源源不绝地顺利通过。
    某部九连战士们在一公尺多深的冰水中搭桥基，他们衣服冻成了冰筒，皮肤冻得发紫，手脚也碰破了，鲜血染红了冰块，但仍然坚持做完了九个小时的工作。
    著名的杨连第连，在执行某车站抢修填挖土方的任务时，由于天气严寒，冻土坚如岩石，一镐下去只掀掉一块小小的薄片。于是战士们便积极开动脑筋，创造了“去皮掏心”、“连环草袋”、“连环土方”等新方法。他们运用这些方法，仅用一百一十个人工，在一天中就挖土三百八十立方公尺，提前三天完成了任务。
    今年虽然敌机千方百计地大肆轰炸破坏北朝鲜的铁路运输线，但志愿军铁道运输部队不仅已如期完成了一九五三年一月份的军事运输计划，而且在运输效率上创造了最高的纪录。
    中国人民志愿军领导机关通报表扬志愿军铁道运输部队在抢修和运输工作中所取得的光辉成就，号召铁道运输部队继续发扬英勇顽强的精神，争取更大的胜利！
