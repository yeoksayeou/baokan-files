Reader's Letters Excerpts:

    Promote the Rapid Learning Method for Reading Russian Professional Books
   (I)
    Pei Qing writes: Learning from the Soviet Union is a universal demand of the broad masses. The success of "Rapid Learning to Read Russian Professional Books" has opened another convenient door for learning from the Soviet Union. However, the detailed content of this rapid learning has not yet been publicly introduced. I suggest publishing a special book on the teaching materials and methods of rapid Russian learning, so that more people can carry out this type of learning.
   (II)
    Qiu Changshu writes: The rapid Russian learning experiment has been successful. Many people want to learn, but there is no opportunity yet. I suggest broadcasting Russian lectures and opening rapid Russian learning classes, and recording the lectures to sell as records, so that more people can use them to learn Russian.

专栏：读者来信摘要

    推广俄文专业书籍阅读速成学习法
   （一）
    培青来信：学习苏联已是广大群众的普遍要求。“俄文专业书籍阅读速成学习”的成功又给学习苏联开了一个方便之门。但这个速成学习的详细内容还没有公开介绍。我建议把俄文速成学习的教材、方法出版专书，让更多的人进行这种学习。
   （二）
    邱常恕来信：俄文速成学习试验成功了。很多人想学，但现在还没有机会。我建议广播俄文讲座开办俄文速成学习班，并将讲课内容录音后灌片出售，以便使更多的人可以利用它来学习俄文。
