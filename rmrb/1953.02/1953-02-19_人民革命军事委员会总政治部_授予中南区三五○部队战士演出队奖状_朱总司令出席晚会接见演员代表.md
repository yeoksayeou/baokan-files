Xinhua News Agency, 18th. The soldiers' art performance team of the 350 unit of the Central-South Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army performed nine shows for the Chinese People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Beijing, government organs, and people from all walks of life at the end of last month, and received universal praise. The General Political Department of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission of the Central People's Government specially held an award ceremony at 11:00 a.m. on February 17th in the auditorium of the General Political Department. Minister Chen Yi of the Cultural Department of the General Political Department, on behalf of the General Political Department, awarded the glorious certificate to the 350 Unit Soldiers' Performance Team. More than 300 representatives from various departments of the Military Commission's General Political Department and troops stationed in Beijing attended the ceremony. In addition to the certificate, the prizes included various musical instruments, books, and other collective and individual awards. At the meeting, Minister Chen Yi said: "The achievements of the 350 Unit Soldiers' Performance Team are the result of implementing Chairman Mao's direction of literature and art serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, and implementing the General Political Department's policy of 'comprehensively developing combat-oriented and mass-oriented cultural and artistic work.'" Chen Yi pointed out that the performance team's programs were all written and performed by the soldiers themselves, profoundly expressing life and the great ideals of the soldiers. He asked the soldiers' performance team to continue their efforts to promote mass artistic activities throughout the army.

On the evening of the 17th, the 350 Unit Soldiers' Performance Team continued to perform at Huairentang in Zhongnanhai. Commander-in-Chief Zhu, Deputy Director Xiao Hua of the General Political Department, and many leaders from various organs of the Central People's Government and the Military Commission attended the evening party. The evening party consisted of twenty programs, each of which received enthusiastic applause from the audience. During the intermission, Commander-in-Chief Zhu also met with fifteen representatives of the performance team's actors and shook hands with the soldier representatives one by one.

The members of the 350 Unit Soldiers' Performance Team include one deputy company commander, one teaching assistant, twenty-two squad leaders and deputy squad leaders, and forty-five soldiers, totaling sixty-nine people. This performance team was formed by the soldier actors from fourteen award-winning programs during the 350 Unit's "August 1st" art review last year. Now, their program has increased to twenty. Among them, "Race Dance," "Accordion Ensemble," "Learn Culture Well and Move Towards Modernization" (dance), and "Happy Cook" are the most exciting. "Race Dance" uses dance to express the theme that hard work will surely succeed and pride will surely fail; the accordion players are all young soldiers who have only studied in the accordion training class for one and a half months, and now they can use harmony to play; "Learn Culture Well and Move Towards Modernization" describes the soldiers' efforts to learn culture, work hard to train soldiers, strengthen national defense construction, and express the joyful dance of the army, navy, and air force being reviewed by Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu in front of Tiananmen Square, expressing the lofty ideals of the people's soldiers; "Happy Cook" describes the happy life of a young cook.

Before coming to Beijing, the team toured 77 performances in various troops of the Central-South Military Region, with an audience of more than 200,000 people. After the performance in Beijing, the team will continue to tour fraternal units.

    【新华社十八日讯】　中国人民解放军中南军区三五○部队战士文艺演出队，在上月底到北京向中国人民解放军驻京各部队、政府机关和各界人民演出了九场，得到普遍的称赞。中央人民政府人民革命军事委员会总政治部特于二月十七日上午十一时，在总政治部礼堂举行授奖典礼，由总政治部文化部陈沂部长代表总政治部授予三五○部队战士演出队以光荣的奖状。出席典礼大会的有军委总政治部各部和驻京各部队的代表三百余人。奖品中除奖状外，还有各种乐器、书报等集体奖和个人奖。会上，陈沂部长说：“三五○部队战士演出队的成绩，是执行毛主席文艺为工农兵服务的方向，执行总政治部‘全面开展战斗性、群众性文化艺术工作’方针的结果。”陈沂指出，演出队的节目都是战士自编自演的，深刻地表现了生活，表现了战士们的伟大理想。他要求战士演出队继续努力，以推动全军的群众文艺活动。
    十七日晚，三五○部队战士演出队在中南海怀仁堂继续演出。朱总司令、总政治部萧华副主任和中央人民政府各机关、军委各机关许多首长出席了晚会。晚会由二十个节目组成，每个节目都得到观众的热烈鼓掌。在休息时间，朱总司令还接见了演出队演员代表十五人，和战士代表们一一握手。
    三五○部队战士演出队的成员，包括一个副连长、一个助教、二十二个正副班长和四十五个战士，共六十九人。这个演出队是由去年三五○部队“八一”文艺检阅时十四个得奖节目的战士演员组成的。现在，他们的节目已增加到二十个。其中以“赛跑舞”、“手风琴合奏”、“学好文化走向现代化”（舞蹈）、“快乐的炊事员”等最精彩。“赛跑舞”是用舞蹈表达努力一定成功、骄傲一定失败的主题思想的；手风琴演奏者都是青年战士，他们只在手风琴训练班里学习了一个半月的时间，现在已能运用和声演奏；“学好文化走向现代化”是描写战士们努力学文化，努力练兵，加强国防建设，和表现陆、海、空军各兵种在天安门前受毛主席、朱总司令的检阅的快乐的舞蹈，表达了人民战士的远大理想；“快乐的炊事员”描写一个年青的炊事员的愉快生活。
