Xinhua News Agency, February 24th dispatch: According to a Vietnam News Agency report on February 22nd: The General Command of the Vietnam People's Army issued a communiqué stating: Guerrilla warfare in the Northern Vietnamese plains continues to develop, and all enemy "sweeps" have been thwarted.

The communiqué stated: French forces conducting "sweeps" in the area south of Nam Dinh on the right bank of the Red River suffered significant losses, with over 800 killed or wounded. Due to the People's Army strengthening activities on the left bank of the Red River, the enemy was forced to halt this "sweep" and move troops to the Quynh Côi and Nha Xa areas of Thái Bình Province, attempting to relieve besieged French outposts. The People's Army fought in the Quynh Côi and Nha Xa areas for two days, eliminating over 500 enemy soldiers. Simultaneously, the People's Army increased activity in the area north of Kiến Xương in Thái Bình Province, and the enemy was again forced to cease the "sweep" of Quynh Côi and Nha Xa and concentrate its forces to "sweep" the area north of Kiến Xương. At this time, the People's Army removed enemy outposts in Quynh Ngoc, Quynh Côi, Trang Kieu, and Tran Xa, cut off Highway 39 in Hưng Yên Province, and increased pressure on Ninh Giang in Hải Dương Province. This time, the enemy was again forced to turn to the Hưng Yên, Hải Dương, Thanh Miện, and Gia Lộc areas to launch an offensive. Here, the French forces were again severely hit by the People's Army and guerrillas, losing over 300 men.

In the mid-Red River region, the People's Army and guerrillas also stepped up their activities. The enemy's "sweeps" in Chí Linh, Nam Sách, Kinh Môn and four other locations were all crushed. Hundreds of enemies were eliminated in each location.

On February 3rd, the People's Army raided the French command headquarters in Nam Dinh city, killing the French major commander and many other officers.

The communiqué pointed out: Since the end of the autumn-winter offensive last year, the enemy has launched 18 consecutive "sweeps" to cope with our guerrilla warfare. All enemy "sweeps" have been thwarted. It is worth noting that the nature of these enemy "sweeps" is different from those launched after the Hòa Bình campaign in 1952. In 1952, the enemy concentrated a large number of troops and was able to "sweep" two or three counties continuously for fifteen days to a month. This year, they also concentrated a large number of troops, but they can only "sweep" one county, and they are forced to withdraw after only a few days. This fact proves that the enemy is increasingly in a passive position in the Northern Vietnamese plains.

### 越人民军在北越平原发展游击战争  连续打败法军“扫荡”

    越人民军在北越平原发展游击战争
    连续打败法军“扫荡”
    【新华社二十四日讯】据越南通讯社二十二日讯：越南人民军总司令部发表公报说：北越平原的游击战争继续发展，敌军的一切“扫荡”都被挫败。
    公报说：在红河右岸南定以南地区“扫荡”的法军，遭到重大损失，死伤八百人以上。由于人民军在红河左岸加强活动，敌军被迫停止这一“扫荡”，把部队调到红河左岸的太平省琼瑰、芽川地区，企图帮助被围的法军据点解围。人民军在琼瑰、芽川地区作战两天，歼灭敌军五百人以上。同时，人民军在太平省的建昌以北地区增加活动，敌人又被迫停止对琼瑰、芽川地区的“扫荡”，集中兵力转来“扫荡”建昌以北地区。这时，人民军拔除了琼玉、琼瑰、庄桥、陈社的敌军据点，切断兴安省的第三十九号公路，并对海阳省的宁江增加压力。这次，敌人又被迫转向兴安、海阳、清冕和嘉禄地区发动进攻。在这里，法军又遭到人民军和游击队的痛击，损失三百人以上。
    在红河中游地区，人民军和游击队也加强活动。敌人在芷灵、南策、敬门等六地的“扫荡”都被粉碎。每地都歼敌几百人。
    二月三日，人民军突袭南定城内的法军指挥部，打死法军少校指挥官和其他许多军官。
    公报指出：从去年秋冬攻势结束以来，敌人曾连续发动了十八次“扫荡”，来应付我们的游击战。敌人的“扫荡”全被挫败。值得注意的是：敌人的这些“扫荡”和一九五二年和平战役以后所发动的，性质已有不同。一九五二年敌人集中的大量兵力，能够“扫荡”二、三个县，时间连续十五天到一个月。今年，他们也集中大量兵力，但只能“扫荡”一个县，而且维持不了几天就被迫撤走。这一事实证明敌人在北越平原越来越处于被动的地位。
