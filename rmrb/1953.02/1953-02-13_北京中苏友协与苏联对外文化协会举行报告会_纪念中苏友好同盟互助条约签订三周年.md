    Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and Soviet Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries Hold Report Meeting
    To Commemorate the Third Anniversary of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance
    [Xinhua News Agency, 12th] The Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and the Soviet Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries jointly held a report meeting on the evening of the 12th to commemorate the third anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance. Minister of Railways Teng Daiyuan of the Central People's Government gave a report. More than 1,000 members of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association from various organs, organizations, factories, enterprises, and schools in Beijing attended the report meeting, including Xu Deheng, Xiao Ming, Shu Sheyu, Cao Jinghua, and Sun Xiaocun, vice presidents of the Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association. Also present at the report meeting were Zhukov, representative of the Soviet Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, Gudev, counselor of the Soviet Embassy in China, Skachkov, and more than one hundred Soviet experts and embassy staff.
    First, Shu Sheyu, vice president of the Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, spoke, saying that the anniversary of the Sino-Soviet friendship alliance is an extraordinary day in world history. Only when China and the Soviet Union join hands and stand shoulder to shoulder to defend world peace can the world have peace.
    Gudev, Counselor of the Soviet Embassy in China, said in his speech: The Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance has opened a new era in the relations between the two countries. Over the past three years, the people of the Soviet Union and China have faithfully fulfilled this treaty, forged an unbreakable friendship, and become a great force for defending world peace.
    Teng Daiyuan, Minister of Railways of the Central People's Government, gave a report entitled "The Great Contribution of Soviet Experts to the Construction of the Chinese People's Railway." He said: Over the past three years, the enthusiastic assistance of Soviet railway experts to China's railway cause has been admirable. They helped us rush to repair the Huaihe River Bridge from Guanhai to Guannei, and restored the Longhai Railway. From the Yuehan Line to the Xianggui Line, from the Xiangjiang Bridge to the Hongshui Bridge, all the railways destroyed by the Kuomintang reactionaries during their defeat were quickly repaired.
    Soviet experts have also brought us advanced experience and helped us overcome many technical and material difficulties. For example, the Tuojiang Bridge on the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, the deep gully bridges and long tunnels on the Tianshui-Lanzhou Railway, and the famous Yellow River Iron Bridge were all built under the enthusiastic guidance of Soviet experts.
    Minister Teng pointed out in his report that the Soviet government has fulfilled the treaty and transferred all the property of the China Changchun Railway to our country free of charge. The Changchun Railway has created amazing achievements in both increasing production and reducing costs, accumulating a large amount of wealth for the country, making the Changchun Railway a model railway with high efficiency, low cost, and high profit among the national railways, all of which are due to the help of Soviet advanced experience.
    Minister Teng pointed out that due to the help of Soviet experts, China's railway industry has achieved the following results in the past three years: 1. The number of tons of goods sent has increased. If 1950 is taken as 100, 1951 reached 110.5, and 1952 reached 131.6; 2. The turnaround time of vehicles has been shortened. 1951 was 3.7% shorter than 1950, and 1952 was 11% shorter than 1951; 3. The average total weight of freight trains has increased. 1951 increased by 8.6% compared with 1950, and 1952 increased by 13.2% compared with 1951.
    Minister Teng finally said: We still need to further learn from the Soviet Union in many ways to build our great motherland.
    After the meeting, the Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Choir and the singing team organized by staff of the Soviet Embassy and Soviet experts held a joint performance.

    北京中苏友协与苏联对外文化协会举行报告会
    纪念中苏友好同盟互助条约签订三周年
    【新华社十二日讯】北京市中苏友好协会和苏联对外文化协会为纪念中苏友好同盟互助条约签订三周年，在十二日晚联合举行报告会。由中央人民政府铁道部部长滕代远作报告。出席报告会的有北京市中苏友好协会副会长许德珩、萧明、舒舍予、曹靖华、孙晓邨和北京市各机关、团体、工厂、企业、学校的中苏友好协会会员一千余人。出席报告会的还有苏联对外文化协会代表茹克福，苏联驻华大使馆参赞顾德夫、司高磋以及苏联专家和大使馆人员百余人。
    首由北京市中苏友好协会副会长舒舍予讲话，他说，中苏友好同盟的纪念日是世界历史上不平凡的日子。只有中苏两国手携手肩并肩地保卫世界和平，世界才可能有和平。
    苏联驻华大使馆参赞顾德夫在讲话中说：苏中友好同盟互助条约在两国关系上开辟了一个新时代。三年来，苏中两国人民忠诚地履行着这个条约，结成了牢不可破的友谊，成为保卫世界和平的伟大力量。
    中央人民政府铁道部部长滕代远作了题为“苏联专家在中国人民铁道建设事业中的巨大贡献”的报告。他说：三年来，苏联铁路专家对我国铁道事业的热情帮助是令人感激的，他们帮助我们从关外到关内抢修了淮河大桥，修复了陇海铁路。从粤汉线到湘桂线，从湘江桥到红水桥，把国民党反动派溃败时所破坏的铁路，全都很快地修通了。
    苏联专家还给我们带来了先进经验，帮助我们克服了许多技术上和物质上的困难。如成渝路的沱江桥、天兰路很多处的深沟桥、长燧道以及著名的黄河大铁桥等，都是在苏联专家的热心指导下修建的。
    滕部长在报告中指出苏联政府已履行条约将中国长春铁路全部财产无偿的移交我国。中长路在增加生产和降低成本两方面都曾创造了惊人的成绩，为国家积累了大量的资财，使得中长路成为全国铁路中效率高、成本低、利润大的模范铁路，这都是苏联先进经验给我们的帮助。
    滕部长指出：由于苏联专家的帮助，我国铁路事业三年来取得了如下的成绩：一、货物发送吨数增高，如以一九五○年为一百，一九五一年达到一百一十点五，一九五二年达到一百三十一点六；二、车辆周转时间缩短，一九五一年比一九五○年缩短了百分之三点七，一九五二年比一九五一年又缩短了百分之十一；三、货物列车平均牵引总重增高，一九五一年比一九五○年增加了百分之八点六，一九五二年比一九五一年又增加了百分之十三点二。
    滕部长最后说：我们还需要更进一步地从多方面向苏联学习，来建设我们伟大的祖国。
    会后，北京市中苏友好协会合唱团和苏联大使馆工作人员及苏联专家们组织的歌咏队举行联欢演出。
