Strengthen Specific Leadership and Unleash the Potential of Agricultural Production in Northeast China
— A Record of the Northeast Agricultural Technology Conference
By our special correspondent Zhang Qingtai

The former Northeast People's Government's Department of Agriculture convened the Northeast Agricultural Technology Conference from January 16th to 24th. More than 100 people attended the conference, including agricultural technology cadres from the agricultural departments and bureaus of various provinces and cities in Northeast China, directors and technical experts from the Northeast Agricultural Science Institute and various provincial agricultural experiment stations, and professors from the Northeast Agricultural College and Shenyang Agricultural College. The conference studied the issue of learning from and promoting the Zhaoyuan experience, and also discussed how much agricultural production potential there is in Northeast China and how to unleash that potential. The comrades who attended the conference unanimously agreed that the main key to unleashing agricultural production potential is to improve cultivation techniques; to improve cultivation techniques, it is necessary to overcome the generalized leadership style and establish a work style that goes deep into reality and deep into the masses.

I. How much agricultural production potential is there in Northeast China?

Based on the results of careful investigation and research, it has been proven that Northeast China's agricultural production has enormous potential. This refers only to the strength that can be unleashed by mobilizing and organizing the broad masses under the current technical conditions, and does not include the strength that the state can increase through large-scale investment in capital construction (such as water conservancy projects, large-scale reclamation of wasteland, and construction of protective forest belts, etc.). At this conference, a concrete analysis was made of this enormous potential force hidden among the masses from several aspects:

(1) At present, the crops in various parts of Northeast China are generally sparsely planted, with uneven row and plant spacing and uneven density. Even under the same natural conditions, the difference in the number of plants per hectare is very large. According to surveys: the maximum number of sorghum plants per hectare is 120,000, and the minimum is only more than 30,000, while the higher and more stable yield is around 80,000; however, in various places, about 60 percent of sorghum is planted with 50,000 to 60,000 plants per hectare, about 35 percent with 40,000 to 50,000 plants per hectare, and about 5 percent with less than 40,000 plants and more than 80,000 plants. According to a survey of the three northern provinces, the maximum number of soybean plants per hectare is 350,000, and the minimum is only 100,000, of which 220,000 to 300,000 plants per hectare have higher and more stable yields. However, in various places, about 80 percent or more of soybeans are planted with 100,000 to 200,000 plants per hectare. There are also such huge disparities in the number of plants planted for other crops. Missing seedlings are even more common. According to the current general standards, an average of 15 to 20 percent of farmland in Northeast China is missing seedlings; based on the production situation in 1952, this could reduce grain production by 3 million to 4 million tons. If calculated according to the new scientific standard of rational close planting, the missing seedling rate is 30 to 40 percent; based on the production situation in 1952, this could reduce grain production by 6 million to 8 million tons. The main reasons for missing seedlings are rough cultivation, poor soil preparation, uneven soil covering, uneven sowing, unreasonable or no thinning, and damage from hoeing. In addition, the masses have a traditional habit of sparse planting, which generally causes a serious waste of land fertility.

(2) At present, the cultivation methods in Northeast China are extensive. The general depth of plowing is only about three inches. Due to long-term shallow plowing, the soil structure is poor, which is not conducive to the growth and development of crops. The old cultivation method of wide rows and large ridges in various parts of Northeast China (especially in the north) has caused a large amount of waste of land fertility. Taking only the three provinces of Heilongjiang, Songjiang, and Jilin as an example, approximately 1 million to 1.5 million hectares of effective planting area are wasted; based on the production situation in 1952, this resulted in a reduction of approximately 1.5 million to 2 million tons of grain. Facts have proven that using the old ridge cultivation method, whether large or small ridges, cannot fully unleash land fertility and increase yield per unit area. Implementing large ridge planting is more likely to cause disadvantages such as a large water evaporation surface, difficulty in implementing rational close planting, easy growth of weeds, and easy attraction of pests and diseases. In the small plots of land of the small-scale peasant economy, it is impossible to implement rational crop rotation, which has caused the phenomenon of continuous cropping. More than 1 million hectares of sorghum in western Liaoning Province are more than 70 percent continuously cropped; some cotton fields have even been continuously cropped for five, six, or even more than ten years. Continuous cropping promotes the decline of land fertility, and pests and diseases are becoming more and more serious. At the same time, due to individual management, land boundaries have not been opened, which not only affects the promotion of new agricultural tools, the reform of cultivation techniques, and the implementation of rational crop rotation, but also causes a large amount of land waste. According to a survey in Dongfeng County, there are a total of 2,500 hectares of field edges in the county, accounting for 2.2 percent of the county's cultivated land area. In addition, according to surveys by many agricultural production cooperatives such as Zhao Wenli and He Fengshan in Jilin, cultivated land has been expanded by 2 to 3 percent due to contiguous land management and the elimination of field edges. Based on this estimate, the waste of field edges in the entire Northeast region is approximately 300,000 to 400,000 hectares.

(3) Most areas of Northeast China still follow the old habit of applying manure "once every three or two years," and a large amount of manure sources have not been utilized; in many areas, people have no toilets, pigs have no pens, and horses have no sheds. Human manure is the most effective fertilizer, and at least 80 percent is wasted in the entire region, approximately 10 million tons per year; if properly mixed with soil, it can be applied to more than 2 million hectares of land. The methods of accumulating fertilizer in various places are also not good, mostly with more soil and less manure, or mixed with raw manure, and lacking reasonable stacking management, resulting in pigs rolling, chickens digging, wind blowing, sun exposure, and rain washing, causing great loss of fertilizer nutrients. According to experiments by the Northeast Agricultural Science Institute, due to this situation, fertilizer efficiency is lost by 20 to 60 percent; if human and animal manure is not padded with soil or covered with soil, and is left to stand naturally, it can lose more than 50 percent of its fertilizer efficiency in ten days. Moreover, applying manure that has not been fermented and decomposed to the ground is also one of the reasons for weeds and pests and diseases.

From the following facts, we can more clearly see how much agricultural production potential there is in Northeast China.

At present, the average yield per hectare of soybeans in Northeast China is 2,448 jin, the highest yield is 9,150 jin, and the lowest yield is only 1,200 jin. There are such large differences in the yield per unit area of other crops. This is by no means entirely determined by different natural conditions. Because under the same natural conditions, the yield per unit area of the same crop is not the same. For example, in Yongji County, Jilin Province, the natural conditions such as soil and climate are the same throughout the county, and the average yield per hectare of sorghum is 4,556 jin, but the highest yield is 7,800 jin, and the lowest yield is only 1,900 jin. The average yield per hectare of corn is 5,960 jin, the highest yield is 10,790 jin, and the lowest yield is only 2,000 jin. The average yield per hectare of millet is 3,944 jin, the highest yield is 15,542 jin, and the lowest yield is only 1,520 jin. The average yield per hectare of rice is 7,224 jin, the highest yield is 17,738 jin, and the lowest yield is only 3,100 jin. According to natural conditions, the lowest yields in various places can be increased to the level of the average yield, and the average yield can also be further improved. The emergence of a large number of new high-yield records in 1952 and the experience of Zhaoyuan in creating large high-yield areas fully prove the existence of this possibility.

Not only that, but the highest yields can continue to be improved. For example, the yield per hectare of wheat of Lan Guohuan in Songjiang was 7,218 jin in 1951, and it increased to 8,050 jin in 1952; the yield per hectare of rice of Cui Zhusong in Jilin was 12,819 jin in 1951, and it increased to 14,609 jin in 1952. Many such examples can be found in various places. From this, it can be seen that our agricultural productivity can be continuously improved.

This is a general overview of the potential that Northeast China's agricultural production can unleash under existing technical conditions. After such careful calculation, detailed investigation, and careful research by the comrades who attended this conference, they unanimously realized that if they can eliminate the causes of yield reduction in an organized and planned way, fully unleash potential, and add conditions such as the promotion of new agricultural tools and the development of the cooperative movement, the entire Northeast region can develop from increasing grain production by one or two million tons per year to increasing grain production by ten or twenty million tons per year. This means that it is entirely possible to strive to increase grain production in Northeast China by 80 to 100 percent within five years.

II. The Key to Unleashing Agricultural Production Potential in Northeast China

Continuously improving cultivation techniques is the main key to fully unleashing land fertility and continuously increasing yield per unit area. Based on the main reasons for yield reduction, the comrades who attended the conference studied specific plans for the number of seedlings to be retained, ridge width, deep plowing for drought prevention, and fertilization methods for various different crops in different regions and under different conditions. Everyone unanimously agreed that the basic requirements for improving cultivation techniques at present are equal spacing and full seedlings, rational close planting, deep plowing to conserve moisture, and rational fertilization.

(1) The central issue in improving cultivation techniques is to ensure equal spacing and full seedlings and implement rational close planting. For general short-stem crops, ensuring equal spacing and full seedlings and implementing wide sowing and close planting on ridge cultivation is a progressive and rational measure based on the old cultivation methods. Because rational close planting can not only make full use of the land, but also reduce soil moisture evaporation and inhibit weed growth. The production practice of farmers in various places has proven this point. According to a survey of seven high-yield areas in northern Liaoning, within the limit of planting 100,000 sorghum plants per hectare, for every 10,000 plants added from 30,000 plants, the yield increased by about 1,000 jin; with 50,000 plants per hectare, the yield was 5,500 jin; with 70,500 plants per hectare, the yield reached 8,300 jin; with 100,000 plants per hectare, the yield reached 10,000 jin. According to a survey in Zhaoyuan, the yield of millet planted with 100,000 to 300,000 plants per hectare did not exceed 5,000 jin; planting 400,000 to 800,000 plants per hectare showed a significant increasing trend: the yield of 490,000 plants per hectare was 5,500 jin, the yield of 600,000 plants per hectare was 7,000 jin, and the yield of 800,000 plants per hectare was 9,000 jin. According to surveys in Shuangcheng and Huachuan counties, the yield of soybeans planted with 100,000 to 150,000 plants per hectare did not exceed 4,500 jin, while the yield of 190,000 plants per hectare was 5,000 jin, and the yield of 220,000 plants per hectare reached 6,000 jin. These can prove that promoting the advanced experience of rational close planting is one of the important conditions for increasing production. Of course, rational close planting does not mean that the denser the better, but rather appropriately increasing the number of plants per unit area according to the conditions of various different crops, and trying to distribute the plants evenly, so as to make full use of land fertility and ensure that each plant occupies a certain living space and obtains good and balanced development.

When promoting rational close planting cultivation methods in various places, it is necessary to combine the experience of the masses and, according to the specific conditions of local soil, climate, varieties, fertilizers, and cultivation techniques, specifically determine the row and plant spacing and the number of plants planted per hectare of cultivated land. It is necessary to specifically help mutual aid teams or agricultural production cooperatives using new agricultural tools to earnestly implement equal spacing and full seedlings and rational close planting, and appropriately reserve "reserve seedlings" for timely replanting.

Implementing equal spacing and full seedlings and rational close planting cultivation methods has universal significance for agricultural production increase in the entire Northeast region in 1953. If it is deeply implemented in each team, each household, and each plot of land, and the phenomenon of missing seedlings is truly eliminated, even without other conditions, production may increase by 15 to 20 percent.

(2) Implementing deep plowing and improving cultivation methods are important measures to improve soil structure, increase land fertility, conserve moisture, reduce weeds, and prevent pests and diseases. To implement rational close planting, it is necessary to have the conditions for deep plowing. At present, old agricultural tools still exist in large quantities, so improving the cultivation methods of old agricultural tools is of universal significance. It is necessary to require old agricultural tools to deepen by another half inch to one inch based on the existing deep plowing. The method currently adopted by farmers in various places of deeply hoeing the ridge ditch early in the spring and then making the ridge for timely sowing should be promoted. Farmers should be persuaded to abandon extremely rough cultivation methods such as "one plow squeeze" and "leaning on the mountain hoe." In areas with thick humus soil using new agricultural tools, deep plowing of more than six inches is required, and in areas with shallow humus soil, deep plowing of more than five inches is required.

In order to improve cultivation techniques based on the old cultivation methods, the northern provinces (large ridge areas) must adopt a phased approach to shrinking ridges and increasing rows: areas with current conditions should be changed to small ridges; if there are difficulties in changing ridges, the method of widening the sowing width should be adopted to shorten the row spacing. It is not right to mechanically engage in "wide sowing and close planting" in some places, propose to change the original small ridges into large ridges, or unconditionally emphasize that ridge cultivation is superior to flat cultivation. All areas using new agricultural tools should implement flat cultivation. Regardless of the south or the north, the cooperative movement should be actively and steadily promoted to gradually eliminate the waste of field edges.

In order to loosen the soil, conserve moisture, cultivate the soil, and remove weeds, hoeing must be carried out in a timely and rational manner. In the past, various places advocated unlimited "multiple hoeing," which not only wasted labor, but also destroyed the soil aggregate structure and affected crop growth.

(3) Fully fertilizing and rationally fertilizing are effective ways to improve the soil, increase land fertility, and strive for high yields; to implement rational close planting, it is even more necessary to ensure sufficient base fertilizer. At present, the amount of fertilizer accumulated in various parts of Northeast China is still 20 to 30 percent short of the planned requirements; it is necessary to further organize winter fertilizer accumulation, study various rapid methods of fermentation (such as pouring boiling water to help fermentation, etc.), and promptly ferment the manure well, so that raw manure is no longer applied to the ground; and we should also seize the opportunity to organize the transfer of urban manure to the countryside. In terms of fertilization methods, for land cultivated with old agricultural tools, it should be advocated to change the method of universal spreading of manure to spreading manure along the ridges, so as to reduce the loss of fertilizer efficiency.

Different manures should be applied to different soil types and different crops, and different fertilization methods should be adopted. Some places misuse beef fat, soybean oil, lard, fox oil, etc. as fertilizers. There is currently no scientific basis to prove that they have any effect, and they should be corrected to avoid wasting resources in vain.

III. Improve Work Style and Strengthen Specific Leadership

In order to make the movement to unleash agricultural production potential a patriotic high-yield movement for the broad masses to improve cultivation techniques, it is necessary to improve the work style of leading cadres and strengthen specific leadership.

(1) Various places must, based on the Zhaoyuan high-yield experience and closely combined with the local high-yield experience, use detailed and specific methods such as checking the size of the land, counting the number of plants, weighing the ears, and evaluating the yield to educate the masses through facts, so as to break some conservative ideas and make the movement to promote advanced experience a self-education for the masses to improve cultivation techniques.

(2) In order to improve cultivation techniques, it is required to organize more labor and exert higher labor efficiency. To this end, various places must earnestly rectify mutual aid and cooperation organizations and further widely mobilize women to participate in production.

(3) It is necessary to formulate specific plans based on specific circumstances and implement them in a phased manner. Agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams should be the focus, and equal spacing and full seedlings, rational close planting, deep plowing to conserve moisture, and rational fertilization cultivation methods should be earnestly implemented. Special attention should be paid to universally eliminating the phenomenon of missing seedlings.

(4) Various places must immediately seize the spring plowing preparation work and conduct in-depth supervision and inspection. This is very important for whether this year's agricultural production work can be done well and whether the measures to improve cultivation techniques can be thoroughly implemented. Various places must make full material preparations and actively act according to the new requirements for improving cultivation techniques.

(5) Leading cadres must overcome the shortcomings of the "generalized" leadership style, learn from the work style of the Zhaoyuan County Committee of the Communist Party of China, go deep into the masses, go deep into reality, and turn the improvement of cultivation methods into the actual actions of millions of people.

IV. Experimental Research Must Be Closely Integrated with Reality

At this conference, the ideas and practices of some agricultural experimental research institutions that were divorced from reality and the masses were criticized. Everyone believed that experimental farms, demonstration breeding farms, and technical guidance stations should shoulder major responsibilities for promoting and guiding the unleashing of agricultural production potential. In order to better shoulder this responsibility, experimental research must be closely integrated with the production practice of the masses. The conference determined that the current experimental research institutions should focus on experimental research to improve cultivation techniques. In the past, focusing on breeding work was inappropriate. According to Michurin's theory, good cultivation techniques can cultivate excellent varieties; inferior cultivation techniques can make good varieties worse. This means that cultivation techniques are the main condition for cultivating excellent varieties, and the idea of ​​isolating breeding work and "breeding omnipotence" is wrong. (Of course, the role of excellent seeds cannot be denied.) At present, experimental research institutions should mainly study the issue of rational close planting, further summarize the experience of the masses, so as to improve on the basis of old cultivation methods. Based on different soils, crop varieties, fertilization conditions, etc., we should derive a set of scientific guidance plans for the rational plant spacing, row spacing, and number of plants per hectare of several major crops, as well as the flat close planting methods of new agricultural tools.

The current task of demonstration breeding farms should be to implement the requirements of equal spacing and full seedlings, rational close planting, deep plowing to conserve moisture, and rational fertilization in the field, and use the facts of more grain production to demonstrate to the masses. The breeding of excellent varieties should be achieved through this improvement of cultivation techniques.

One of the current tasks of agricultural technical guidance stations is to focus on guiding the masses (mainly production cooperatives and mutual aid teams) to implement the specific requirements for improving cultivation techniques. To this end, stations with conditions should try to sign technical contracts with agricultural production cooperatives or mutual aid teams to ensure that all the basic requirements of this set of improved cultivation techniques are fully realized.

    加强具体领导，发挥东北农业生产的潜力
    ——记东北农业技术会议
    本报特约记者　张庆泰
    原东北人民政府农业部在一月十六日到二十四日召开了东北农业技术会议。参加会议的有一百多人，包括东北各省、市农业厅、局的农业技术干部，东北农业科学研究所及各省农业试验场的所长、场长、技术专家，东北农学院和沈阳农学院的教授。会议研究了学习和推广肇源经验问题，又讨论了东北农业生产的潜力有多大和怎样发挥这些潜力的问题。到会的同志们一致认为：发挥农业生产潜力的主要关键是改进耕作技术；要改进耕作技术就必须克服一般化的领导作风、树立深入实际深入群众的作风。
    一、东北的农业生产潜力有多大
    根据认真调查研究的结果，证明东北农业生产具有巨大的潜在力量。这仅指在目前的技术条件下，通过发动组织广大群众就可以发挥出来的力量，还不包括国家用大量投资进行基本建设（如兴修水利、大规模开垦荒地、营造防护林带等）可以增加的力量。在这次会议上，从几个方面，对于这种蕴藏在群众中的巨大潜在力量作了具体的分析：
    （一）目前东北各地的农作物，一般是稀植的，行距株距不等，疏密不匀，就在同一自然条件下，每垧株数的差别也很大。根据调查：高粱每垧株数最多的有十二万株，最少的只三万多株，而产量较高和较稳定的在八万株左右；但各地高粱每垧种五万到六万株的大约占百分之六十，四万到五万株的大约占百分之三十五，四万株以下和八万株以上的大约占百分之五。根据北部三个省调查，大豆每垧株数最多的是三十五万株，最少的只有十万株，其中产量较高而稳定的是二十二万到三十万株。但各地大豆每垧栽植十万到二十万株的大约占百分之八十以上。其他作物种植的株数，也有这样巨大的悬殊。缺苗更是普遍现象。按目前一般的标准计算，东北各地的农田，平均缺苗一成半到二成；以一九五二年生产情况计算，可减产三百万吨到四百万吨粮食。如按新的科学的合理密植的标准计算，则缺苗三成到四成；以一九五二年生产情况计算，可减产六百万吨到八百万吨粮食。缺苗的主要原因，是耕作粗糙，整地不细，覆土不匀，播种不均，间苗不合理或不间苗，以及铲?伤害等。加以群众有稀植的传统习惯，这就普遍地造成了严重浪费地力的现象。
    （二）目前东北耕作方法是粗放的。一般农田耕深仅三寸左右。由于长期浅耕，土壤结构不良，不利于作物的生长发育。东北各地（特别是北部）的宽行大垅的旧耕作法，更造成了地力的大量浪费。仅以黑龙江、松江、吉林三个省计算，就大约浪费了有效播种面积一百万垧到一百五十万垧；以一九五二年生产情况计算，约减产一百五十万吨到二百万吨粮食。事实证明，使用旧的垅作法，无论大垅小垅，都不能充分发挥地力，提高单位面积产量。而实行大垅种植，更容易产生水分蒸发面大，不便于实行合理密植，杂草易于生长，容易招致病虫害等缺点。在小农经济的小块土地上，不能实行合理的轮作，这就造成了重槎迎槎的现象。辽西省一百多万垧高粱，其中百分之七十以上是重槎连作；有的棉田甚至重槎了五、六年到十几年。重槎促使地力衰退，病虫害也越来越重。同时，由于个体经营，未能打开地界，不仅影响了推广新农具，改革耕作技术，实行合理轮作，而且造成了大量土地的浪费。据东丰县调查，全县地畔子共有二千五百垧，占全县耕地面积的百分之二点二。另外，根据吉林赵文礼、何凤山等许多农业生产合作社的调查，由于土地连片经营，消灭了地畔子，扩大耕地达百分之二到百分之三。这样估计，东北全区仅地畔子的浪费大约就有三十万垧到四十万垧。
    （三）东北大部地区仍然因袭着“三年或二年一槎粪”的老习惯，大量粪源未被利用；很多地区还是人无厕所，猪无圈，马无棚。人粪尿是最有效的肥料，全区至少浪费百分之八十左右，每年约有一千万吨；如果适当地掺上土，就可以上二百多万垧地。各地积肥方法也不好，大都是土多粪少，或者夹杂着生粪，并且缺乏合理的堆积管理，以致猪滚鸡刨，风吹日晒雨冲，肥分损失极大。据东北农业科学研究所试验，由于这种情况，肥效损失百分之二十至百分之六十；人畜粪尿不垫土不盖土，实行自然放置，十天即可损失肥效百分之五十以上。而且粪肥不经发酵腐熟，就上在地里，更是地里杂草丛生和发生病虫害的原因之一。
    从下面这些事实，更可清楚地看到东北的农业生产潜力有多大。
    目前东北大豆的单位面积产量，平均每垧是二千四百四十八斤，最高产量是九千一百五十斤，最低产量仅一千二百斤。其他各种作物的单位面积产量都有这样大的差别。这绝不是完全由不同的自然条件决定的。因为在同一的自然条件下，同一作物的单位面积产量是不相同的。譬如吉林永吉县全县土壤气候等自然条件都一样，高粱单位面积产量平均每垧是四千五百五十六斤，但最高产量是七千八百斤，最低产量仅一千九百斤。苞米单位面积产量平均每垧是五千九百六十斤，最高产量是一万零七百九十斤，最低产量只有二千斤。谷子单位面积产量平均每垧是三千九百四十四斤，最高产量是一万五千五百四十二斤，最低产量只有一千五百二十斤。水稻单位面积产量平均每垧是七千二百二十四斤，最高产量是一万七千七百三十八斤，最低产量只有三千一百斤。按照自然条件来说，各地的最低产量都可能提高到平均产量的水平，平均产量也都可能再提高一步。一九五二年大批丰产新纪录的出现和肇源创造的大片丰产地的经验，完全可以证明这种可能性的存在。
    不仅如此，最高产量仍然可以继续提高。譬如松江蓝国焕的小麦单位面积产量一九五一年是七千二百一十八斤，一九五二年就提高到八千零五十斤；吉林崔竹松的水稻单位面积产量一九五一年是一万二千八百一十九斤，一九五二年就提高到一万四千六百零九斤。各地都可以找到很多这样的例证。由此可见，我们的农业生产力是完全可以不断提高的。
    这就是在现有技术条件下，东北农业生产可以发挥的潜力的概况。参加这次会议的同志们经过这样细算细查认真研究之后，一致认识到：如果能够有组织有计划地消灭减产的原因，充分发挥潜力，加上推广新式农具开展合作化运动等条件，全东北就可以由每年增产一两百万吨粮食发展到增产一两千万吨粮食。这就是说，争取在五年之内使东北粮食产量增加百分之八十到一倍，是完全可能的。
    二、发挥东北农业生产潜力的关键
    不断地改进耕作技术，是充分发挥地力，不断地提高单位面积产量的主要关键。参加会议的同志们根据减产的主要原因，研究了各种不同作物在不同地区、不同条件下的留苗株数、垅宽尺度、深耕防旱、施肥方法等具体方案。大家一致认为，目前改进耕作技术的基本要求是等距全苗、合理密植、深耕保墒、合理施肥。
    （一）改进栽培技术的中心问题，就是保证等距全苗、实行合理密植。一般矮棵作物，在垅作上保证等距全苗，实行宽播密植，是在旧耕作法基础上的一个进步的合理的措施。因为合理密植不仅可以充分利用土地，而且可以减少土壤水分的蒸发和抑制杂草的滋长。各地农民生产实践都证明了这一点。据辽北地区七处丰产地的调查，高粱在每垧地种植十万株的限度内，由三万株起，每增加一万株，产量即相应提高一千斤左右；每垧五万株，产量为五千五百斤；每垧七万零五百株，产量即达八千三百斤；每垧十万株，产量即达一万斤。据肇源调查，谷子每垧种植十万到三十万株的，产量都没有超过五千斤；每垧种植四十万株到八十万株的就表现了明显的增产趋势：每垧四十九万株的产量为五千五百斤，每垧六十万株的产量为七千斤，每垧八十万株的产量为九千斤。根据双城、桦川两县调查，大豆每垧种植十万到十五万株的，产量都没有超过四千五百斤，而每垧十九万株的，产量则为五千斤，每垧二十二万株的产量达到六千斤。这些都可以证明推广合理密植的先进经验是增产的重要条件之一。当然，合理密植的意思并不是越密越好，而是根据各种不同作物的情况，适当地增加单位面积上的株数，并尽量使植株分布均匀，以便充分利用地力，保证每株作物都占有一定生活领域，得到良好的均衡的发育。
    各地推行合理密植的栽培方法的时候，必须结合群众经验，再根据各地土壤、气候、品种、肥料、耕作技术等具体条件，具体决定行、株距及每垧耕地种植的株数。应该具体地帮助使用新式农具的互助组或农业生产合作社认真实行等距全苗、合理密植，并适当留出“预备苗”，以便及时进行补苗。
    贯彻等距全苗、合理密植的栽培方法，对于一九五三年东北全区农业增产具有普遍的意义。如果深入贯彻到每组、每户、每一块土地上，真正消灭了缺苗现象，即使不加其他条件，也可能增产一成半到二成。
    （二）实行深耕，改进耕作方法，是改良土壤结构，增进地力，保蓄水分，减少杂草和防治病虫害的重要措施。要实行合理密植，就要具备深耕的条件。目前旧农具还大量存在，因此，改进旧农具的耕作法，是具有普遍意义的。要求旧农具在现有深耕的基础上再加深半寸到一寸是必要的。各地农民现在采用的乘早春先深?一次垅沟，再行作垅以适时播种的办法，应该加以提倡。应该说服农民放弃“一犁挤”“靠山耲”等极为粗糙的耕作法。使用新式农具的腐植质土较厚的地区，要求深耕六寸以上，腐植质土较浅的，要求深耕五寸以上。
    为了在旧的耕作法基础上改进耕作技术，北部各省（大垅地区）必须采取有步骤地缩垅增行的方针：目前有条件的地区应当改为小垅；改垅有困难的，应采取加宽播幅的办法，缩短行距。有的地方机械地搞“宽播密植”，提出把原有小垅改成大垅，或无条件地强调垅作优于平作，是不对的。使用新式农具地区都应当实行平作。无论南部和北部，都应积极地稳步地推行合作化运动，逐渐消灭地畔子的浪费现象。
    为了松土保墒，培土除草，必须及时地合理地进行铲?。过去各地提倡从春到秋无限制地“多铲多?”，结果不仅浪费劳力，而且破坏土壤团粒组织，影响作物生长。
    （三）充分施肥、合理施肥是改良土壤、增进地力、争取丰产的有效办法；要实行合理密植，更必须保证有充分的基肥。目前东北各地积肥量按计划要求，还缺少百分之二十到三十；必须进一步组织冬季积肥，研究各种发酵的速效办法（如泼以开水帮助发酵等），及时把粪沤好，不再使生粪下地；并应抓紧组织城市的粪肥下乡。在施肥方法上，对于旧农具垅作的地，应提倡把普遍扬粪的方法改为顺垅摅粪，使肥效减少损失。
    对于不同的土质和不同的作物，应该施用不同粪肥，并采用不同的施肥方法。某些地方有乱用牛油、豆油、猪油、狐狸油等做肥料，目前还没有科学根据证明有什么效力，应该纠正，以免白白浪费物力。
    三、改进工作作风，加强具体领导
    为了使发挥农业生产潜力的运动成为广大群众改进耕作技术的爱国主义丰产运动，必须改进领导干部的工作作风，加强具体领导。
    （一）各地必须根据肇源丰产经验，并紧密结合本地丰产经验，用查弓口（量地的长度宽度）、数楂子、称穗头、评产量等细致具体的方法，通过事实教育群众，以便打破某些保守思想，使推广先进经验运动成为群众改进耕作技术的自我教育。
    （二）为了改进耕作技术，要求组织更多的劳动力和发挥更高的劳动效率。为此，各地必须认真地把互助合作组织整顿好，并进一步广泛发动妇女参加生产。
    （三）必须根据具体情况，订好具体计划，有步骤地贯彻执行。要以农业生产合作社和互助组为重点，认真实行等距全苗、合理密植、深耕保墒、合理施肥等栽培方法。要特别注意普遍地消灭缺苗现象。
    （四）各地必须立即抓紧春耕准备工作，进行深入的督促检查。这对于今年农业生产工作能否搞好，改进耕作技术措施能否彻底贯彻执行，是很重要的，各地必须根据改进耕作技术的新要求，作好物质上的充分准备，积极行动起来。
    （五）领导干部必须克服领导作风“一般化”的缺点，学习中共肇源县委的工作作风，深入群众，深入实际，把改进耕作方法变成千百万群众的实际行动。
    四、试验研究要密切结合实际
    在这次会议上，批判了农业试验研究机关的一些脱离实际脱离群众的思想和做法。大家认为试验场、示范繁殖场和技术指导站对于发挥农业生产潜力要担负重大的促进和指导的责任。为了很好地担负这个责任，试验研究必须和群众的生产实践密切结合起来。会议确定：目前试验研究机关应该以改进耕作技术的试验研究为中心任务。过去以育种工作为重点是不适当的。按照米丘林学说，良好的耕作技术，可以培育出优良的品种；低劣的耕作技术；能使好的品种变坏。这就是说，耕作技术是培育优良品种的主要条件，孤立地搞育种工作和“育种万能”的想法，都是不对的。（当然也不能因此否定优良种子的作用。）目前试验研究机关主要应该研究合理密植的问题，进一步总结群众经验，以便在旧耕作法基础上有所改进。应该根据不同土壤、作物品种、施肥条件等，将几种主要作物的合理的株距、行距与每垧株数，以及新式农具平作密植方法等，得出一套科学的指导方案。
    示范繁殖场当前的任务应该是在本场内贯彻实现等距全苗、合理密植、深耕保墒、合理施肥的要求，以多打粮食的事实为群众示范。对于优良品种的繁殖，就通过这种改进耕作技术来实现。
    农业技术指导站的当前任务之一是有重点地指导群众（主要是生产合作社和互助组）贯彻执行改进耕作技术的具体要求。为此，有条件的站应当和农业生产合作社或互助组试订技术合同，以保证这一套改进耕作技术的基本要求全部实现。
