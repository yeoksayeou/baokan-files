Xinhua News Agency, February 15th: Ignoring the protests of upright people in the United States and around the world, Eisenhower brazenly announced on the 11th his refusal to grant the Rosenbergs' request to overturn their unreasonable verdict.

The Rosenbergs, who were falsely accused of so-called "espionage" by the American judicial authorities and sentenced to death, have repeatedly stated from the beginning that they are completely innocent and that they were framed by the American judicial authorities and the FBI simply because they advocated peace and freedom. During the obviously discriminatory trial, the court could not produce any credible evidence to prove the accusations against the Rosenbergs, relying solely on the confessions of so-called "witnesses" arranged by the FBI, the purely fabricated nature of which has been criticized even by many bourgeois scholars in the United States. For example, the famous American atomic scientist Dr. Urey wrote to the "New York Times" expressing his doubts about the verdict. He said: "I find the Rosenbergs' testimony more credible than Greenglass's testimony...." Greenglass was the main "witness" in the so-called "Rosenberg case." Federal Judge Kaufman, who was in charge of the trial, admitted that Greenglass's so-called "testimony" was the main basis for his sentencing the Rosenbergs to death.

This purely framed verdict by the New York Federal Court has aroused public outrage and protests from upright people in various countries, but the American judicial organs even refused to retry the case.

In his decision, Eisenhower repeated Kaufman's absurd claims, insisting that the Rosenbergs had committed a "crime" "worse than murder," and he expressed "satisfaction" with the federal court's barbaric verdict of murdering the innocent.

Even the American bourgeois newspaper "Newsday" said that the American authorities' approach was merely "a clever way for future possible tyrants to strangle the people without abolishing the constitution."

Eisenhower's brutal decision, which disregarded justice, immediately aroused strong opposition from upright people around the world. Representatives of the American people began another round-the-clock march in front of the White House on the 14th, demanding the reversal of the unreasonable verdict against the Rosenbergs.

According to the German News Agency, Eisenhower's heinous actions aroused the anger and disgust of the people of Democratic Germany, who have put forward enthusiastic protests. The European Workers' Committee Against the Remilitarization of Germany sent a telegram on behalf of millions of European workers to Eisenhower, urging him not to commit a crime against humanity and to pay attention to the protests of peace-loving people around the world.

The Romanian News Agency reported that people from all walks of life in Romania felt strong anger at Eisenhower's decision. "Spark" newspaper published an article commenting on Eisenhower's decision, pointing out that this proves that the American ruling clique is pursuing a policy of inciting a new world war and is attempting to establish fascist rule to consolidate their rear.

According to reports from Rome, under the pressure of strong public opinion, the Vatican was forced to announce on the 12th that the Pope had received many urgent appeals asking him to intervene in the US government's anti-human crime of deliberately murdering the Rosenbergs.

    艾森豪威尔蓄意杀害罗森堡夫妇
    悍然拒绝撤销原判
    【新华社十五日讯】艾森豪威尔不顾美国国内和世界各国正直人民的抗议，在十一日悍然宣布拒绝罗森堡夫妇要求撤销对他们的无理判决的请求。
    被美国司法当局诬加所谓“间谍”罪名并判处死刑的罗森堡夫妇，从开始就一再申诉他们完全是清白无罪的，他们受到美国司法当局和联邦调查局的陷害只是因为他们主张和平和自由。在明显的歧视性的审讯过程中，法院提不出任何可信的证据来证明对罗森堡夫妇的控告，仅仅根据联邦调查局安排的所谓“见证人”的供辞，这种供辞的纯粹伪造的性质，连美国许多资产阶级学者也加以批评。例如，美国著名原子科学家尤雷博士曾写信给“纽约时报”，对判决表示怀疑。他说：“我发现罗森堡夫妇的证辞比格林格拉斯的证辞更可信些……。”格林格拉斯是所谓“罗森堡案”的主要“见证人”。负责审讯的联邦法官考夫曼曾承认，格林格拉斯的所谓“见证”是他判处罗森堡夫妇死刑的主要根据。
    纽约联邦法院这种纯粹栽赃陷害性质的判决，引起各国正直人士的公愤和抗议，但美国司法机关甚至拒绝重新审理这个案件。
    艾森豪威尔在他发布的决定里重复了考夫曼的谰调，硬说罗森堡夫妇犯了所谓“甚于谋杀”的“罪行”，他并且对联邦法院的这种谋杀无辜的野蛮判决表示“满意”。
    连美国资产阶级的报纸“新闻日报”也说，美国当局这种做法只是“使将来可能的暴君无须废除宪法便可以绞杀人民的一种巧妙办法”。
    艾森豪威尔这一蔑视正义的残暴决定立刻激起了世界各国正直人民的强烈反对。美国人民的代表十四日起又在白宫前举行彻夜不断的游行，要求撤销对罗森堡夫妇的无理判决。
    据德意志通讯社报道，艾森豪威尔的罪恶行动激起了民主德国人民的愤怒和憎恶，他们纷纷提出激昂的抗议。欧洲工人反对德国重新军国主义化委员会代表千百万欧洲工人致电艾森豪威尔，要他不要犯反人类的罪行而注意全世界爱好和平人民的抗议。
    罗马尼亚通讯社报道，罗马尼亚各界人民对艾森豪威尔的决定感到强烈的愤怒。“火花报”发表文章，评论艾森豪威尔的决定，指出这证明美国统治集团推行煽起新的世界大战的政策，正企图建立法西斯统治以巩固他们的后方。
    据罗马消息，在强烈的舆情的压力下，梵蒂冈在十二日被迫宣布，教皇曾收到许多紧急呼吁，要求他干涉美国政府蓄意残杀罗森堡夫妇的反人类罪行。
