Chairman Chen, fellow committee members:

I am entrusted by the Standing Committee to present a report on the work of the conference to the fourth session of this committee.

(1) Regarding the work of the Standing Committee

In the past year or so, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the Standing Committee has implemented the resolution of the Third Session of the National Committee on November 1, 1951: to continue strengthening the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, promote and drive forward the patriotic increase production and practice economy movement, and promote the ideological remolding movement.

In strengthening the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, in order to ensure that the Resist America, Aid Korea sub-committees at all levels obtain the cooperation and assistance of the democratic parties and people's organizations, this committee has urged the provincial and municipal consultative committees to regularly pay attention to promoting all aspects of participation in the various activities launched by the Chinese People's Committee to Resist America and Aid Korea, and with the consent of the standing committees of the people's representative conferences of each county (city), to concurrently serve as the Resist America, Aid Korea county (city) sub-committee. When the American aggressors frantically carried out germ warfare, this committee promoted consultative bodies at all levels, democratic parties, and people's organizations to actively participate in the patriotic health movement. To commemorate the first anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteers' entry into Korea to fight, this committee issued the Resist America, Aid Korea commemorative medal to the Chinese People's Volunteers and all other personnel participating in the Resist America, Aid Korea campaign in Korea. In 1952, when the second anniversary of the Resist America, Aid Korea campaign was approaching, this committee, together with the Chinese People's Committee to Resist America and Aid Korea, organized the Second Chinese People's Delegation to Korea to go deep into the front lines to comfort the heroic and victorious Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army, and to report to the People's Volunteers on the achievements of various reforms and construction in the motherland. After returning to the country, the delegation went to various places to report the heroic deeds of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army to the broad masses of the people, and conveyed the concern and messages of the Volunteers for the motherland and the people of the motherland. On this basis, the Chinese People's Committee to Resist America and Aid Korea issued instructions on continuing to strengthen the Resist America, Aid Korea work. Not long ago, when the American aggressors manipulated the United Nations to illegally pass the Indian proposal to forcibly detain Chinese and Korean prisoners of war, and conspired to undermine the armistice negotiations and expand the war of aggression, this committee, together with the democratic parties, jointly issued a statement resolutely opposing the crimes of the American aggressors and calling on the people of the whole country to continue to strengthen the Resist America, Aid Korea movement and strive for a fair and reasonable settlement of the Korean War.

In promoting and driving forward the patriotic increase production and practice economy movement, the main task of this committee has been to follow Chairman Mao's wise call and assist the People's Government in carrying out the great "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements. To this end, the Standing Committee, on the one hand, urged consultative committees at all levels to actively participate in the movement, and on the other hand, assisted the democratic parties and people's organizations to launch the movement from within. The "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" were a great and universal reform movement within the people's democratic united front. From the central to the local levels, consultative bodies at all levels, democratic parties, and people's organizations all participated in this movement without exception and received great education. This movement strictly exposed and criticized the thoughts, behaviors, and their influence of the "three evils" and "five poisons" of some staff members and the bourgeoisie, thereby further purifying and consolidating the people's democratic united front, consolidating the state's financial and economic discipline, paving the way for the patriotic increase production and practice economy movement and the large-scale construction work that began this year, and at the same time strengthening the forces of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement. However, it is impossible to completely eliminate the "three evils" and "five poisons" with just one movement, so we must constantly supervise and eliminate them to enhance the increase production and practice economy movement.

In promoting the ideological remolding movement, in January 1952, this committee issued a decision to launch a study movement for ideological remolding of people from all walks of life, and established a study committee of the National Committee as a leading body, and then decided and notified the whole country to carry out and participate in the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" as the rectification and study of 1952. In June, it announced the beginning of the study of the Common Program, and in November, it added Stalin's speech and Malenkov's report at the 19th Congress of the CPSU as study content. This year, it is planned to continue studying the Common Program, and to combine the study with the upcoming promulgation of the election law and the draft constitution. In the study, we must pay attention to coordinating with the tasks of national construction, strengthen the ability to complete business, and improve the quality of abiding by state laws and disciplines. 1952 was a year of popularizing the ideological remolding movement to all aspects and achieving great victory. The five types of people (people from democratic parties, non-party people in governments, people's organizations and consultative bodies at all levels, experts in government and enterprises, people in industry and commerce, and people in religious circles) referred to in this committee's study decision mostly participated in the "Three-Anti," "Five-Anti," and ideological remolding movements in government, schools, and enterprises, or democratic reform movements, or general study movements. Experience has proven that the method of combining free debate with criticism and self-criticism is a good study method and can be promoted. There are still some shortcomings in the study movement. The most important shortcoming is that the study committees of some provincial and municipal consultative committees have not yet been established, and these local consultative bodies should be required to establish them quickly. Secondly, the scope of learners in some places is not clear, going beyond the five types of people stipulated by this committee, or there is a lack of necessary steps and division of labor, and individual places have also experienced commandism. Based on existing experience, the five types of people referred to in the study decision, those who believe that it is more convenient to participate in the study in their work departments should not participate in the study organized by this committee and local consultative bodies, in order to facilitate integration with business and avoid duplication; those who are inconvenient to participate in the study in their work departments should still participate in the study organized by this committee and local consultative bodies. There are also some difficulties in the study movement. The biggest difficulty is that it is difficult to invite appropriate speakers and people to answer questions. This requires the local organizations of the Chinese Communist Party to help solve. The study movement is an important method for remolding thoughts, completing construction tasks, and consolidating the people's democratic united front. But to carry it out well, special attention must be paid to two points: First, distinguish the objects and, according to their needs and possibilities, stipulate the content, methods, and steps of the study; second, consultative bodies and their study committees at all levels must strive as much as possible for the leadership and assistance of the local propaganda departments of the Chinese Communist Party.

In the slogans and calls for celebrating May Day Labor Day and celebrating National Day in 1952, this committee also repeatedly emphasized the above three movements. Due to the development of the three movements, the work of the democratic parties and people's organizations has been greatly promoted. During this period, the democratic parties developed their membership by more than one to two times, further consolidating their ranks and improving the political level of their members. The preparatory committee of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, the preparatory committee of the China Islamic Association, and the preparatory office of the China Buddhist Association were also established during this period. The victorious progress of the above three movements is inseparable from the efforts of the provincial and municipal consultative committees, that is, the local committees of this committee. According to recent inspections and reports, the organization and work of the provincial and municipal consultative committees have generally improved, but the situation is still very inconsistent and can be roughly divided into three categories. The first category is better. Their work institutions are relatively sound, with an appropriate number and quality of working cadres, a certain amount of business activity funds, and especially the local leadership has given sufficient attention and support, thus establishing regular work. They have achieved considerable results in assisting the government in mobilizing the people to promote various movements and central tasks, in contacting the people, reflecting and handling people's opinions, and organizing people from all walks of life to conduct studies, and have played the due role of consultative bodies. This type of provincial and municipal consultative bodies is still only a minority at present. The second category is worse. They have carried out some work, but it is not regular enough and not comprehensive enough. This is closely related to the local leadership's lack of attention and the lack of staff. This type of provincial and municipal consultative bodies is still the majority at present. The third category is the worst. The institutions are very unsound, the cadres are few and not fixed; the meetings are not held frequently, and the meetings often become a formality; there are few regular activities, or even none at all. Although there are not many consultative bodies of this type, they should be given attention and improved by the leadership in various places. It should be pointed out that this committee's guidance and assistance to the provincial and municipal consultative committees, that is, the local committees, is also insufficient. From the results of recent inspections and reports, some of their problems, such as staffing and funding, should be appropriately handled by the central government.

The above is a brief report on several major tasks.

(2) Regarding the preparation for convening the Second Plenary Session of the People's Political Consultative Conference

Now, I will report on the Standing Committee's proposal to prepare for convening the Second Plenary Session of the People's Political Consultative Conference.

The Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, in its nature, is an organization of the national people's democratic united front (see Article 13 of the Common Program and Article 1 of the People's Political Consultative Conference Organization Law), not an organ of state power. Therefore, its existence is not affected by the convocation of the national people's congress elected by universal suffrage. The Chinese people's democratic united front is a united front led by the working class, based on the worker-peasant alliance, and uniting the urban petty bourgeoisie, the national bourgeoisie, all ethnic minorities in the country, overseas Chinese, and other patriotic elements. After the implementation of the people's congress system elected by universal suffrage, this people's democratic united front should not only continue to exist but should be strengthened. Similarly, the organization of the people's democratic united front should not only continue to exist but should be enriched and consolidated in order to fulfill its duties.

In accordance with the provisions of Article 6 of the People's Political Consultative Conference Organization Law, the Standing Committee proposes that the Fourth Session of the National Committee of this People's Political Consultative Conference make a decision to convene the Second Plenary Session of the People's Political Consultative Conference. The Standing Committee also puts forward the following specific suggestions for the preparation and convocation work:

(1) The Common Program needs to be appropriately revised. The current Common Program of the People's Political Consultative Conference is also the fundamental law of the People's Republic of China; but after the Constitution of the People's Republic of China is formulated, the basic contents of the current Common Program concerning the state's social system, political system, and the rights and obligations of the people will be incorporated into the Constitution. Therefore, the Common Program as the common program of the people's democratic united front needs to be appropriately revised.

(2) The Organization Law of the People's Political Consultative Conference also needs to be revised as necessary. In terms of its importance: Article 7 concerning the People's Political Consultative Conference's plenary session exercising the functions and powers of the National People's Congress should be cancelled; after the implementation of the people's congress system at all levels in the locality, Chapter 5 concerning the People's Political Consultative Conference's local committees, that is, local united front organizations, should be enriched; other articles should also be re-examined based on past experience and new situations, and those that need to be revised or supplemented should be revised and supplemented.

(3) On the one hand, the people's congress system elected by universal suffrage is about to be implemented. On the other hand, people from all walks of life have been organized. Therefore, the Second Plenary Session of the People's Political Consultative Conference should be composed of representatives of the democratic parties, people's organizations, ethnic minorities, overseas Chinese, and other patriotic democratic人士. The participating units and their quotas should be appropriately arranged according to the actual situation and needs, and the method of egalitarianism should not be adopted.

(4) In accordance with the provisions of Article 15 of the People's Political Consultative Conference Organization Law that the Standing Committee presides over the affairs of the National Committee, all preparatory work for convening the Second Plenary Session of the People's Political Consultative Conference (including the work of proposing amendments to the Common Program and amendments to the Organization Law) and the convocation work should be entrusted to the Standing Committee. The Standing Committee must also preside over the affairs of the National Committee until the opening of the Second Plenary Session of the People's Political Consultative Conference. To this end, we propose to expand the number of Standing Committee members and elect 23 additional Standing Committee members. We believe that under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, the Standing Committee will be able to successfully complete the tasks entrusted to it by the Fourth Session of this committee.

Chairman, fellow committee members, the First Plenary Session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and its National Committee have gloriously completed its tasks of important historical significance under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party. As the last meeting of this National Committee is being held, the climax of welcoming the three great tasks of 1953 is unfolding in front of our great motherland and great people. We believe that all the democratic parties and people's organizations participating in the People's Political Consultative Conference will more actively supervise their members, strive to victoriously complete these three great tasks, and test and improve themselves in this struggle, in order to prepare for the convening of the Second Plenary Session of the People's Political Consultative Conference.

Let us shout:

Strive for the victorious completion of the three great tasks of 1953!

Strive for the consolidation and progress of the people's democratic united front headed by Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party!

Long live the People's Republic of China!

Long live Chairman Mao!

    中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会常务委员会关于会务的报告
    ——一九五三年二月四日在中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第四次会议上的报告
    陈叔通主席，各位委员：
    我受常务委员会的委托，向本会第四次会议提出会务报告。
    （一）关于常务委员会的工作
    一年多以来，常务委员会在毛主席领导下，执行了一九五一年十一月一日全国委员会第三次会议的决议：继续加强抗美援朝运动、提倡和推动爱国增产节约运动及推动思想改造运动。
    在加强抗美援朝运动方面，为使各级抗美援朝分会取得各民主党派和人民团体的配合与协助，本会曾督促各省、市协商委员会经常注意推动各方面参加中国人民抗美援朝总会发动的各种活动，并由各省协商委员会征得各县（市）各界人民代表会议常务委员会同意，兼任抗美援朝县（市）分会的职务。当美国侵略军疯狂地进行细菌战的时候，本会曾推动各级协商机关、各民主党派和各人民团体积极参加爱国卫生运动。为纪念中国人民志愿军赴朝作战的一周年，本会曾颁发了抗美援朝纪念章给在朝鲜境内参加抗美援朝的中国人民志愿军及其他一切人员。一九五二年，当抗美援朝第二个周年临到时，本会又会同中国人民抗美援朝总会组织了中国人民第二次赴朝慰问团深入前线，慰问英勇和胜利作战的中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军，并向人民志愿军报告祖国各种改革和建设的成就。慰问团返国后，分赴各地，在广大人民面前报告了中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军的英勇事迹，传达了志愿军对于祖国和祖国人民的关怀和寄语。中国人民抗美援朝总会在此基础上，发布了关于继续加强抗美援朝工作的指示。不久以前，当美国侵略者操纵联合国非法通过强迫扣留中朝战俘的印度提案，阴谋破坏停战谈判和扩大侵略战争时，本会即会同各民主党派联合发表声明，坚决反对美国侵略者的罪行，并号召全国人民继续加强抗美援朝运动，为实现朝鲜战争公平合理的解决而奋斗。
    在提倡和推动爱国增产节约运动方面，本会主要的工作，就是遵照毛主席的英明号召，协助人民政府进行了伟大的“三反”和“五反”运动。为此，常务委员会曾一方面督促各地协商委员会积极参加运动，另一方面协助各民主党派和人民团体从其内部展开运动。“三反”和“五反”，这是人民民主统一战线内部的一次伟大而又普遍的改革运动。从中央至地方，各级协商机关、各民主党派和人民团体都无例外地参加了这次运动，并受到很大的教育。这次运动，使一部份工作人员和资产阶级之“三害”、“五毒”的思想、行为及其影响，受到了严格的揭露和批判，从而进一步地纯洁了和巩固了人民民主统一战线，巩固了国家的财政经济纪律，为爱国增产节约和今年开始的大规模建设工作铺平了道路，同时也更加强了抗美援朝运动的力量。但“三害”和“五毒”不可能靠一次运动就全部肃清，因此，我们还必须经常加以监督和扫除，以增强增产节约运动。
    在推动思想改造运动方面，一九五二年一月本会已发布了开展各界人士思想改造的学习运动的决定，并成立了全国委员会的学习委员会作为领导机构，随又决定并通知全国以进行和参加“三反”和“五反”作为一九五二年的整风学习。六月宣布开始学习共同纲领，十一月增添了联共十九次代表大会上斯大林演说和马林科夫报告为学习内容。今年拟继续学习共同纲领，并结合即将颁布的选举法和宪法草案进行学习。在学习中，我们要注意配合国家建设任务，加强完成业务的能力，提高遵守国家法纪的品质。一九五二年是思想改造运动普及到各方面并取得伟大胜利的一年。本会学习决定中所指的五类人士（各民主党派人士，各级政府、人民团体和协商机关中的无党派人士，政府和企业中的专家，工商界人士和宗教界人士），大都分别参加了“三反”、“五反”以及机关、学校和企业中的思想改造运动，或民主改革运动，或一般的学习运动。经验证明，思想的自由论争与批评、自我批评相结合的方法，是一个好的学习方法，可加以推广。学习运动中还存在着一些缺点。其中最主要的一个缺点是有些省、市协商委员会的学习委员会迄未成立，应要求这些地方的协商机关迅速把它建立起来。其次是有些地方学习者的范围不明确，超出本会规定的五类人士之外，或缺乏必要的步骤和分工，个别地方还发生命令主义现象。依据已有的经验，学习决定中所指的五类人士，凡认为在他们的工作部门中参加学习较为便利者，应不参加本会和各地协商机关所组织的学习，以利于同业务相结合并避免重复；其不便参加所在工作部门学习者，则仍参加本会和各地协商机关所组织的学习。学习运动中也还存在着一些困难。其中最大的困难，是很难请到适当的报告人和解答问题的人。这需要中共各地方组织帮助解决。学习运动是改造思想、完成建设任务、巩固人民民主统一战线的重要方法。但要进行得好，特别要注意两点：第一、分别对象，依据他们的需要与可能，规定学习的内容、方式和步骤；第二、各级协商机关及其学习委员会必须尽可能争取当地中共宣传部门的领导和帮助。
    在一九五二年庆祝五一劳动节和庆祝国庆节的号召与口号中，本会也再次地强调了上述三项运动。由于三项运动的开展，各民主党派和人民团体的工作得到很大的推动。各民主党派在此期间发展了党员一倍至二倍以上，进一步巩固了队伍，提高了成员的政治水平。中华全国工商业联合会筹备委员会、中国伊斯兰教协会筹备委员会和中国佛教协会筹备处，也都是在这个期间成立的。上述三项运动的胜利进行，是与各省、市协商委员会亦即本会地方委员会的努力分不开的。依据最近的视察和汇报，各省、市协商委员会的组织和工作一般都有进步，但情况仍很不一致，大体可分为三类。第一类较好，它们的工作机构较为健全，有适当数量和质量的工作干部，有一定的业务活动费，特别是当地领导方面给予了充分的重视和支持，因而建立了经常工作。它们在协助政府动员人民推动各项运动和中心工作上，在联系人民、反映和处理人民意见以及组织各界人士进行学习等工作上，均获得了相当的成绩，发挥了协商机关应有的作用。这类省、市协商机关在目前还只是少数。第二类较差，它们进行了部份工作，但不够经常，不够全面，这与当地领导方面重视不够和机构编制不充实是有密切关系的。这类省、市协商机关在目前还是多数。第三类最差，机构很不健全，干部既少又不固定；会议既不常开，开会又往往流于形式；经常活动很少，甚至完全没有。这类省、市协商机关虽然不多，但亟应引起各地领导方面的注意，而加以改进。应当指出，本会对于省、市协商委员会亦即地方委员会的指导和帮助，也是不够的。从最近的视察和汇报结果看来，它们中的某些问题如编制和经费等，是应当由中央加以适当处理的。
    以上是关于几项主要工作的简要报告。
    （二）关于准备召开人民政协
    第二届全体会议
    现在，我来报告常务委员会对于准备召开人民政协第二届全体会议的提议。
    中国人民政治协商会议，就其性质说，是全国人民民主统一战线的组织（见共同纲领第十三条，人民政协组织法第一条），而不是政权机关。因此，它的存在不受普选的全国人民代表大会召开的影响。中国人民民主统一战线，是以工人阶级为领导，工农联盟为基础，团结城市小资产阶级、民族资产阶级、国内各少数民族、国外华侨及其他爱国分子在内的统一战线。这样的人民民主统一战线，在普选的人民代表大会制实现以后，不仅应该继续存在，而且应该加强。同样，人民民主统一战线的组织也不仅应该继续存在，而且应该加以充实和巩固，以便履行职务。
    常务委员会根据人民政协组织法第六条的规定，提议本届人民政协全国委员会第四次会议作出召开人民政协第二届全体会议的决定。常务委员会并对于准备和召集的工作，提出如下的具体建议：
    （1）共同纲领需作适当修改。现行的人民政协共同纲领，同时即是中华人民共和国的根本大法；但在中华人民共和国宪法制定之后，现行共同纲领中有关国家的社会制度、政权制度及人民的权利和义务等基本内容，将要纳入宪法之中。因此，作为人民民主统一战线的共同纲领需作适当的修改。
    （2）人民政协的组织法也需作必要的修改，举其重要者而言：第七条关于人民政协全体会议执行全国人民代表大会职权的规定应予取消；在地方各级人民代表大会制度实现后，第五章关于人民政协地方委员会即地方统一战线组织的规定应予充实；其他各条款也要依据以往经验和新的情况，重新加以研究，有需要修改或补充的，应予修改补充。
    （3）一方面普选的人民代表大会制度即将实行，另一方面，各界人民已经组织起来，因此，人民政协第二届全体会议，以由各民主党派、各人民团体、国内少数民族、国外华侨及其他爱国民主人士的代表组成为宜。参加的单位及其名额，应依据实际的情况和需要作适当安排，不应采取平均主义的办法。
    （4）依据人民政协组织法第十五条常务委员会主持全国委员会会务的规定，应将召开人民政协第二届全体会议的一切准备工作（包括提出共同纲领修正案及组织法修正案的工作）及召集工作，付托常务委员会去进行。常务委员会并须主持全国委员会会务直至人民政协第二届全体会议开幕时为止。为此，我们提议扩大常务委员名额，增选二十三位常务委员。我们相信，在毛主席和中国共产党领导之下，常务委员会一定能够圆满地完成本会第四次会议所付托的任务。
    主席，各位委员，中国人民政治协商会议第一届全体会议及其全国委员会，在毛主席和中国共产党领导之下，已经光荣地完成了它的有重要历史意义的任务。当此本届全国委员会最后一次会议举行之际，在我们伟大祖国和伟大人民的面前，正展开着迎接一九五三年的三个伟大任务的高潮。我们相信参加人民政协的一切民主党派和人民团体会更加积极督率自己的成员，为胜利地完成此三个伟大的任务而努力奋斗，在此努力奋斗中来考验和提高自己，来准备人民政协第二届全体会议的召开。
    让我们高呼：
    为一九五三年三个伟大任务的胜利完成而奋斗！
    为以毛主席和中国共产党为首的人民民主统一战线的巩固和进步而奋斗！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    毛主席万岁！
