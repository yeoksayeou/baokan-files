    Introducing Simple Methods for Observing a Solar Eclipse
    Letters from He Lezhi and Xue Tian: On the morning of February 14th (the first day of the first lunar month), many places across the country will be able to see a partial solar eclipse. However, looking directly at it with the naked eye can injure the eyes due to the strong sunlight. What is a good way to observe it? In addition to using dark-colored glasses or using a basin of water to reflect the sun's image, we introduce the following simple methods:
    First, you can use developed photographic negatives to view through. Second, use blackened or smoked glass to observe. Third, blacken a mirror with smoke and look at the sun's reflection in the mirror. Fourth, cut a finger-thick round hole in the middle of a piece of thick paper, cover the mirror with it, and then reflect the sunlight shining on the mirror through the small hole onto a wall in a dark place (the darker the place, the brighter the reflection) (it is better for the mirror to be about two zhang away from the wall), and you can see the shape of the sun at that time. Another benefit of doing this is that it allows many people to observe at the same time.

    介绍几种看日食的简便方法
    何乐之、薛田来信：二月十四日（即阴历正月初一）早晨，全国许多地方都能看到日偏食。但直接用肉眼去看，眼睛会被强烈的阳光刺激而受伤。怎么看法好呢？除了用深颜色的眼镜或用一盆清水倒映日影外，我们再介绍以下几种简便的方法：
    第一，可以用照像底片透视。第二，用涂黑或薰黑了的玻璃片来观测。第三，将镜子薰黑，从镜中看太阳反射的影子。第四，在厚纸中间剪一个手指粗细的圆孔，盖在镜面上，然后再将照在镜面上的太阳光从小孔内反射到阴暗处（越暗越亮）的墙壁上（镜离墙约两丈远较宜），就可以看出当时太阳的形状。这样做还有一个好处，可以使很多人同时观测。
