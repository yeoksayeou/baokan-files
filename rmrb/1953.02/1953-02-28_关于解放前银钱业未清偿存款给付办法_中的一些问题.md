A few questions regarding the "Measures for Paying Unsettled Deposits of Silver and Money Shops Before Liberation"

Editor's Note: After this newspaper published the "Measures for Paying Unsettled Deposits of Silver and Money Shops Before Liberation" by the State Council of the Central People's Government on February 20, we have received many letters from readers raising some questions. We now have the General Administration of the People's Bank of China provide a comprehensive response below. Some readers have written to inquire about some detailed issues concerning registration procedures. Please consult the nearest People's Bank or the deposit bank for clarification. This newspaper will not provide individual responses.

Q: What is the basis for dividing the pre-liberation period into three stages in item 2 of the State Council's "Measures for Paying Unsettled Deposits of Silver and Money Shops Before Liberation"?

A: As stated in the measures, these three stages are divided according to "the financial changes in each period." The financial prices were basically stable before December 31, 1937, which is the first stage. The period from January 1, 1938, to August 18, 1948 (the eve of the change to the pseudo-gold yuan notes) was the second stage, during which the pseudo "legal tender" was used. From August 19, 1948, until liberation, the overall trend of the pseudo currency was towards total collapse, which is the third stage. This is a rough outline of the division of the three stages.

Q: Why is interest not calculated when repaying pre-liberation deposits?

A: For deposits made before 1937, because repayment is calculated based on silver dollars, the standard is already very generous. If interest were added, the national financial burden would be too heavy, and the payment capacity of the banks and shops would also be difficult. As for the period after the currency devaluation in 1937, the interest rate in each year could not keep up with the price increase. If repayment was calculated completely according to the historical interest rate, it would not be beneficial to the depositors. The financial industry's repayment of the principal according to the silver dollar standard is a consideration for the depositors, but the burden on the financial industry is already very heavy, and a large part of it is borne by the state. Therefore, it is reasonable to adopt the method of repaying the principal according to the silver dollar standard without calculating interest.

Q: Why is the silver dollar exchange rate used as the standard for repayment?

A: The connection between pseudo-currency and silver dollars was relatively close before the war. Before 1937, silver dollars and pseudo-currency were of equal value, and some depositors deposited silver dollars at that time. Therefore, it is more reasonable to use the current highest silver dollar exchange rate of 12,500 yuan as the repayment standard for deposits before 1937. After 1937, due to the annual depreciation of the pseudo currency, silver dollars were no longer in circulation. Therefore, it was necessary to first derive the discount of the pseudo-legal tender devaluation from the price index of each year, and then multiply it by the silver dollar exchange rate of 12,500 yuan as the repayment standard for each year.

Q: Why is a graded and decreasing repayment rate adopted for pre-liberation deposits?

A: The main spirit of the graded and decreasing payment method is to achieve comprehensive consideration. In the decreasing rate, the latter level still enjoys the amount of the previous level. For example, if a deposit was 500 yuan in 1937, the repayment rate of its own level is 70 percent, but if the first, second, third, and fourth levels enjoyed at the same time are included, then the actual repayment rate is 88 percent. Why is the range of the first level up to 200 yuan? This is because this level accounts for 80 percent of all depositors, which means that the vast majority of depositors are taken care of.

Q: Why are those with deposit amounts of more than 200 yuan not paid in full in cash, but given fixed-term and fixed-amount savings deposit certificates from the People's Bank of China?

A: Because if all the cash is paid off at once, a large amount of currency will be put into the market all at once. Therefore, the method adopted the measure of one-time repayment and phased payment, and interest is paid according to regulations. This is still beneficial to the original depositors.

Q: What is the reason for adopting different standards for clearing pre-liberation unsettled overseas remittances and domestic unsettled remittances?

A: Most of the pre-liberation unsettled overseas remittances were funds enthusiastically remitted back by overseas Chinese for the sake of patriotism during the Anti-Japanese War. At that time, the Kuomintang reactionary government took the opportunity to plunder overseas remittances. Pseudo-bureaucratic capital banks accumulated a large number of overseas remittances without paying them, causing significant losses to overseas Chinese and causing great difficulties for the lives of their families. Therefore, the People's Government gives care to overseas Chinese, and pre-liberation unsettled overseas remittances are paid according to the standard of fixed-term deposits. Domestic pre-liberation unsettled remittances are mostly due to the relocation of banking institutions or the departure of payees from their original locations, and the situation is different. Therefore, they are cleared according to the standard of current deposits.

Q: Why are the "Savings for National Construction," "Savings Bonds for National Construction," "Special Prize-Winning Savings Bonds," "US Dollar Savings Bonds for National Construction" and "Township Public Welfare Savings Bonds" issued by the Kuomintang reactionary government not repaid?

A: As everyone knows, in order to deceive the people, the Kuomintang reactionary government created various pretexts and issued the so-called "Savings for National Construction" and other five types of savings bonds through pseudo-banks, bureaus, and associations. In essence, they were government bonds and donations and taxes of the Kuomintang government, and cannot be treated as deposits, so they should not be repaid.

### “关于解放前银钱业未清偿存款给付办法”中的一些问题

    “关于解放前银钱业未清偿存款给付办法”中的一些问题
    编者按：二月二十日本报发表了中央人民政府政务院“关于解放前银钱业未清偿存款给付办法”以后，我们先后接到不少读者来信，提出了一些问题。现请中国人民银行总行综合答复于后。有一部分读者来信询问有关登记手续的一些细节问题，请向就近的人民银行或存款行庄询问，本报不再作个别答复。
    问：政务院“关于解放前银钱业未清偿存款给付办法”第二项中，把解放前时期划分为三个阶段，其根据是什么？
    答：在办法中已经说明；这三个阶段是按照“各个时期金融变化情况”来划分的。一九三七年十二月三十一日以前，这个时期的金融物价基本上是稳定的，为第一阶段。一九三八年一月一日至一九四八年八月十八日（即改用伪金元券前夕）为止，这一期间使用伪“法币”，为第二阶段。一九四八年八月十九日到解放时为止，这一期间伪币总的趋势是走向总崩溃，为第三阶段。这就是三个阶段划分的大致情况。
    问：偿还解放前存款时为什么不计利息？
    答：在一九三七年以前的存款，由于按照银元计算偿还，标准已很优厚；如再计利息，国家财政负担过重，行庄方面的偿付力量也有困难。至于一九三七年通货贬值后，各年利息赶不上物价上涨速度，如果完全按照历年利息计算偿还，对于存户并不有利；由金融业按照银元偿付本金，对于存户是照顾了的，对于金融业负担已经很重，而且其中很大一部分是由国家负担的。因此，采取本金与银元标准偿还、利息不再计算的办法办理是合理的。
    问：为什么采取以银元牌价做为偿付标准？
    答：战前伪币和银元的联系较为密切。在一九三七年以前，银元和伪币等值，而且当时有的存户也拿银元存款；因此，一九三七年以前的存款按现在银元最高牌价一万二千五百元做为偿还的标准是比较合理的。在一九三七年以后，由于伪币逐年贬值，银元不再流通，因此不得不从每年的物价指数上，先求出伪法币贬值的折扣，再乘一万二千五百元的银元牌价作为各年的偿还标准。
    问：解放前存款为什么要采取分级递减率偿还？
    答：分级递减的给付办法的主要精神是为了做到全面照顾。在递减中，后级仍享有前级清偿的金额。例如一九三七年存款五百元，按其本级的偿还率为百分之七十，但如将同时享受的第一、二、三、四级计算在内，那么，实际的偿还率为百分之八十八。第一级的幅度为什么要到二百元为止呢？这是因为这一级占全部存款户的百分之八十，也就是说照顾了绝大多数的存款户。
    问：存款金额在二百元以上者，为什么不全部给现金，而给予中国人民银行定期定额储蓄存单？
    答：因为如果一次全部付清现金，就会使大量货币一齐投入市场，因此办法中采用了一次偿还，分期给付的措施，并照章给利息。这对原存款人仍是有利的。
    问：解放前未解侨汇与国内未解汇款采取不同标准清理的原因何在？
    答：解放前未解侨汇大部分是侨胞在抗日战争期间为爱国而踊跃汇回的款项。当时国民党反动政府借机掠夺侨汇，伪官僚资本银行将侨汇大量积压而不予解付，给侨胞造成重大损失，造成侨眷生活极大困难。因此，人民政府给予侨胞以照顾，解放前未解侨汇按照定期存款标准给付。而国内解放前未解汇款大都是由于银行机构撤离或收款人迁离原地而发生，情况不同，因此按照活期存款标准清偿。
    问：国民党反动政府发行之“节约建国储金”、“节约建国储蓄券”、“特种有奖储蓄券”、“美金节约建国储蓄券”以及“乡镇公益储蓄券”等为何一律不予清偿？
    答：正如大家所知道的，国民党反动政府为了欺骗人民，巧立名目，曾经通过伪行、局、会发行了所谓“节约建国储金”等五种储蓄券，实质上系国民党政府的公债、捐税，不能当作存款处理，故不应偿还。
