The Hebei Provincial People's Government Department of Finance has seriously violated financial regulations by accumulating and misappropriating large amounts of central revenue funds, and by failing to earnestly implement the Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Central Treasury Regulations. The Hebei Provincial Department of Finance had accumulated over 181.4 billion yuan in agricultural taxes, of which 91 billion yuan was misappropriated. In 1950, the department collected over 77.4 billion yuan in agricultural tax (cotton conversion funds). From November 1951, it deposited all of it in the Hebei Provincial Branch of the People's Bank of China and obtained two months' worth of interest. When selling the cotton, the department demanded over 15.6 billion yuan in interest from the Hebei Provincial Branch of the China National Cotton, Yarn and Fabrics Corporation (the provincial corporation paid in installments when purchasing the cotton, hence the interest), of which over 10 billion yuan in interest should have been remitted to the central government. The department did not report this to the Ministry of Finance of the Central Government and instead treated it as local financial revenue. In the summer of 1951, over 7.2 billion yuan in surrogate tax payments was accumulated and misappropriated for more than seven months. Of the over 96.8 billion yuan in autumn surrogate tax payments, over 32 billion yuan was accumulated for six to seven months, over 45 billion yuan was accumulated for three months, and over 16 billion yuan was accumulated for two months. They also deposited over 6.4 billion yuan in the bank to generate interest. For the industrial and commercial tax revenue from January to October 1952, the department accumulated a portion at the beginning and end of each month. According to statistics from last October, industrial and commercial tax revenue was accumulated for one to seven days at the beginning of the month and sixteen to fifty days at the end of the month.

The central government promulgated the revised Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Central Treasury Regulations in May 1951, ordering all parts of the country to implement them starting July 1st. However, the Hebei Provincial Department of Finance and its sub-treasuries arbitrarily decided that, with the exception of industrial and commercial tax revenue, the remaining revenue would still be handled according to the province's temporary reporting and remittance methods stipulated in 1951. The reason given was that "the tax categories reported by lower levels to the Finance Department are complicated, and this department needs to classify them, which is to be responsible for the central funds." The method was as follows: the remittance of funds from provincial-level revenue departments such as the Provincial Department of Finance, the Grain Bureau, and the Monopoly Company would first be recorded in the sub-treasury under the "provisional receipts" account, and could only be remitted after the provincial-level revenue department completed the exchange procedures. The Ministry of Finance of the Central Government instructed the Hebei Provincial Department of Finance on October 16, 1951, to implement the revised Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Central Treasury Regulations. The Central General Treasury also forwarded the instructions of the Ministry of Finance of the Central Government to the Hebei Provincial Sub-treasury on October 24th. However, the Hebei Provincial Department of Finance ignored this and did not implement it until August 1952. As a result, the central tax revenue received by the provincial sub-treasury could not be remitted on its own and had to wait for the revenue departments to exchange receipts, but the revenue departments did not exchange receipts in a timely manner, leading to a serious accumulation of central funds.

Article 8 of the revised Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Central Treasury Regulations stipulates: "The receipt reports of all levels of the treasury must be filled out and submitted on the same day. The superior treasury shall summarize and remit them on the same day upon receipt and shall not accumulate them." Article 9 further stipulates: "In order to promptly concentrate treasury funds, each sub-branch treasury shall remit the treasury funds received by its subordinate collection offices and itself to the superior branch treasury by telegraphic transfer on the same day; each branch treasury shall summarize and remit them to the General Treasury on the same day." It is clear that the temporary reporting and remittance methods stipulated by the Hebei Provincial Department of Finance and the sub-treasury themselves violated the central regulations. Their so-called "responsibility for central funds" was actually an excuse for accumulating and misappropriating central tax revenue.

The main reasons for the Hebei Provincial Department of Finance's violation of financial discipline are: first, the leading cadres of the Hebei Provincial Department of Finance have serious departmentalism in their thinking and lack an overall perspective. They always want to collect more revenue for the local area in order to be more affluent. They are very eager to urge the central government to provide funds to subsidize the local area, even going so far as to send responsible cadres to the Ministry of Finance to demand them. However, they not only fail to remit the funds that the department should remit to the central government in a timely manner, but instead misappropriate them to deposit in banks to generate interest, taking advantage of the central government in various ways. Second, there is a serious lack of organization and discipline in the Hebei Provincial Department of Finance and the sub-treasury. They did not regard the Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Central Treasury Regulations promulgated by the central government as national laws, and they did not respect the instructions of the Ministry of Finance of the Central Government and the Central General Treasury. They had an attitude of self-righteousness.

The actions of the Hebei Provincial Department of Finance in violating financial discipline are serious. The province did not conduct an inspection of such serious errors during the "Three-Anti" movement. When the Ministry of Finance of the Central Government and the Finance Bureau of the North China Administrative Committee sent an inspection team to conduct an inspection, the department initially said on the surface that it welcomed the inspection by the superiors and said that the more times the superiors inspected, the greater the help to them. However, when dealing with practical issues, they showed a great lack of humility and even a confrontational attitude. This was manifested in: Ma Li, the current director of the Finance Department, and Wang Rongqing, the chief of the Accounting Section, both said that they did not understand the situation, and even used the nonsense of Liang Caichen, the "tiger" in the "Three-Anti" movement and the former deputy chief of the Accounting Section, to argue with the inspection team, and even believed that the materials on their own account books were not as reliable as what Liang Caichen said. Regarding the issue of not implementing the Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Central Treasury Regulations, they said it was because "there was no task to remit funds in 1951, so it was not necessary to implement them." They considered it "arbitrary" to criticize them for not earnestly implementing the Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Central Treasury Regulations; they called the misappropriation of central agricultural tax revenue "allocations from higher authorities"; and they called the misappropriation of central funds to deposit in banks to generate interest "...no misappropriation at all." Zhou Zhengxin, the deputy director of the Finance Department, said: "...That's right, there is localism and departmentalism in Hebei Province, but the central government's failure to allocate funds in a timely manner also contributes to the emergence of localism, and the central government should also examine this point. ...I am not clear about the meaning of the word 'misappropriation'. If Hebei Province spends central funds, spends educational and cultural expenses or enterprise investments, etc., it can be called 'misappropriation', otherwise it is not misappropriation..." Niu Yunlong, the deputy director of the Finance Department's Office, said: "The Ministry of Finance of the Central Government and the North China Finance Bureau believe that the Hebei Finance Department has two sets of accounts. But our current accounts are chaotic, which proves that there is only one set of accounts. If there were two sets of accounts, the accounts might not be so chaotic." In short, they tried every means to cover up their mistakes, emphasizing that the "materials have discrepancies" and "do not conform to the actual situation" in the inspection team's understanding to delay time. It was not until the inspection team re-verified the materials and proved that the facts were conclusive that the provincial Finance Department admitted its mistakes, conducted oral and written self-criticisms, and put forward suggestions for improvement. However, the Hebei Provincial Department of Finance's self-criticism still did not thoroughly expose the errors ideologically, especially the problem of their confrontational attitude towards the joint inspection team of the Ministry of Finance of the Central Government and the North China Finance Bureau, which was still not reviewed. The Hebei Provincial People's Government should urge the Finance Department to conduct an in-depth inspection and truly recognize this serious mistake ideologically. The Ministry of Finance of the Central Government, the North China Finance Bureau, and the People's Supervision Committee should investigate the responsibility for the Hebei Provincial Department of Finance's violation of financial discipline and give appropriate punishment to the relevant personnel.

    河北省财政厅严重违反财政制度
    大量积压和挪用应该上缴中央的款项
    河北省人民政府财政厅大量积压和挪用中央收入款项，并且不认真执行中央金库条例施行细则，严重地违犯了财政制度。河北省财政厅曾积压农业税款一千八百一十四亿余元，其中挪用的达九百一十亿元。一九五○年，该厅征收农业税（棉花变款）七百七十四亿余元，从一九五一年十一月开始全部存入中国人民银行河北省分行，并取得了两个月的全部利息。出售棉花时，该厅曾向中国花纱布公司河北省公司索取利息一百五十六亿余元（省花纱布公司购买这批棉花时陆续付款，因此需付利息），其中应上缴中央利息一百余亿元。该厅未向中央财政部报告，即作为地方财政收入。一九五一年夏征代金税款七十二余亿元，该厅积压与挪用七个多月。秋征代金税款九百六十八亿余元，其中有三百二十余亿元积压六至七个月，四百五十余亿元积压三个月，一百六十余亿元积压两个月，他们并以六十四亿余元存入银行生息。一九五二年一至十月份的工商税款，该厅在每月月初月末都要积压一部。根据去年十月份统计，月初积压工商税款一天至七天，月末积压十六天至五十天不等。中央于一九五一年五月间公布了修订中央金库条例施行细则，通令全国各地于七月一日开始执行。但河北省财政厅与分金库擅自确定：除工商税收入外，其余收入仍按该省一九五一年规定的临时报解办法执行，理由是“下级报财政厅税款名目杂乱，本厅要进行分类，这是对中央款负责”。其办法是：省财政厅、粮食局及专卖公司等系统收入的上解款，由分金库先以暂收款科目记账，待省级收入部门办理换解手续后始能上解。中央财政部曾于一九五一年十月十六日指示河北省财政厅，按修订的中央金库条例施行细则执行，中央总金库也于十月二十四日将中央财政部之指示转给河北省分金库，但河北省财政厅仍置之不理，一直拖到一九五二年八月份才执行。因此该省分金库收到的中央税款均不能自行上解，必须等待收入部门换据，但收入部门又不及时换据，因此造成严重的积压中央款的现象。修订中央金库条例施行细则第八条规定：“各级库之收款报告，均须于当日填送，上级库于收到当日，即行汇总报解，不得积压。”第九条又规定：“为及时集中库款，各支库应将所辖经收处及本身收入库款，当日信汇上级分库；各分库当日汇总汇解总金库。”很显然，河北省财政厅与分金库自行规定的临时报解办法，是违犯中央规定的。其所谓“对中央款负责”，实际上是积压与挪用中央税款的借口。
    河北省财政厅违犯财政纪律的主要原因是：第一，河北省财政厅领导干部的思想上存在着严重的本位主义，缺乏整体观念。他们总想给地方上多收入一些，以便宽裕一些。他们对于中央应补助地方之款催得很紧，甚至不惜派负责干部在财政部催要。但对该厅应解中央之款则不但不能及时上解，反而挪入银行生息，从各方面占中央的便宜。第二，河北省财政厅与分金库存在着严重的无组织无纪律现象，没有把中央公布的中央金库条例施行细则看成国家法律，对中央财政部与中央总金库的指示不够尊重，存在着自以为是的情绪。河北省财政厅违犯财政纪律的行为是严重的。该省对这样严重的错误在“三反”运动中没有进行检查。中央财政部与华北行政委员会财政局派检查组去进行检查时，该厅开始在表面上说欢迎上级对他们的检查，并说上级检查的次数越多，对他们的帮助越大。但接触实际问题时，则表现了极不虚心，甚至有对抗情绪。这表现在：财政厅现任厅长马力、会计科长王荣青都说不了解情况，又以“三反”中的“老虎”、前任会计科副科长梁采臣的胡言乱语来与检查组胡搅，甚至对自己账本子上的材料都认为不如梁采臣说的话可靠。对于没有执行中央金库条例施行细则的问题，他们说是因为“一九五一年没有上解款的任务，故不一定要执行。”对检查组批评他们没有认真执行中央金库条例施行细则，则认为是“武断”；对挪用中央农业税款，说是“上级拨款”；对挪用中央款存入银行生息，说成“……丝毫没有挪用”。财政厅副厅长周政新说：“……不错，河北省是有地方主义本位主义的，但中央不及时拨款，也助长了地方上本位主义的产生，这一点，中央也应检查。……‘挪用’二字的意义我不清楚，河北省将中央款花了，开支了文教费或企业投资等可以叫‘挪用’，否则不是挪用……”财政厅办公室副主任牛云龙说：“中央财政部、华北财政局认为河北财政厅有两套账。可是我们现在账目乱，就证明只有一套账，如果有两套账，账目可能就不乱了。”总之，他们生方设法来掩饰他们的错误，以强调检查组了解的“材料有出入”“不符合实际情况”等方法来拖延时间。直到检查组重新对证材料，证明事实确凿以后，该省财政厅才承认了错误，进行了口头的与书面的检讨，提出了改进的意见，但河北省财政厅的检讨仍没有从思想上彻底揭发错误，特别他们对中央财政部与华北财政局联合检查组有对抗情绪的问题，仍没有检讨。河北省人民政府应敦促财政厅深入进行检查，真正从思想上认识这一严重的错误。中央财政部和华北财政局以及人民监察委员会应对河北省财政厅违犯财政纪律的事追查责任，予有关人员以适当处分。
