Building in Battle
——A Visit to Albania
Kong Dongping

I. "Palace of the Guerrillas"

On a small hill near Tirana, the capital of Albania, stands a magnificent palace, once a place where reactionary rulers held sway. After liberation, the palace was renamed "Palace of the Guerrillas." Every year during festivals, the Albanian working people gather here with their beloved leaders to celebrate their holidays together.

On November 29, 1952, I accompanied General Huang Zhen, the representative of the Central People's Government of our country, to Tirana to participate in the celebrations commemorating the eighth anniversary of Albania's liberation. On this day, a grand review and demonstration parade were held in the square. In the evening, Enver Hoxha, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the People's Republic of Albania and First Secretary of the Albanian Labor Party, held a grand banquet at the "Palace of the Guerrillas" to entertain delegations from various countries. In addition to the heads of the Labor Party and government departments, labor models from various industries and agriculture, veteran revolutionary fighters, families of martyrs, and religious leaders from all over the country also attended the banquet. It was a very moving scene. The entire venue was like a big family. After the guests and hosts finished the banquet, they all held hands and formed a large circle, dancing the Albanian national dance with abandon. Workers, peasants, officers, and soldiers gathered together, singing ancient folk songs and old guerrilla songs at the top of their voices, recalling the days of heroic struggle; after singing, they embraced each other enthusiastically.

Vice Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Comrade Shehu, sat next to an old farmer who was 108 years old. He came from the Topoja mountainous region in the north. In the past, he was an old revolutionary fighter who resisted the Turks and the Zogu reactionaries (Zogu was the former king of Albania). The old man was in good spirits, but his ears were not very good. He suddenly clenched his fist with piercing eyes and said loudly: "I will not rest in peace until our one million Albanian compatriots in Yugoslavia are liberated." The old man's heart was filled with hatred for the Tito gang! On this festive night celebrating the eighth anniversary of liberation, how many Albanian residents within Yugoslavia were suffering torture in Tito's concentration camps!

The Topoja mountainous region was one of the guerrilla base areas during the anti-fascist war. Comrade Hoxha visited there not long ago. He said to a farmer named Surima: "Please tell me, what is the most important thing in your daily life?"

"We dedicate ourselves to labor, in order to make the Party stronger, and to fight as firmly and unyieldingly as in the past," Surima replied. "We will never allow anyone to invade us. Whenever you summon us, we will take up arms. You know, all of us mountain people know how to handle guns, and each of us vows to defend our motherland and defend peace."

This is the voice of the Albanian people. This is the source of the strength of this young People's Republic.

II. One Hand Holding a Gun, One Hand Building

After the end of World War II, the Albanian people began to build their own country under extremely difficult conditions. But the vicious and evil U.S. and British imperialists did not allow the Albanian people to have the opportunity to build their new lives. They colluded with all the reactionary forces around Albania—the Tito gang, the Greek royalist fascists, and the reactionary governments of Italy and Turkey—forming a four-sided encirclement and blockade against Albania. The Albanian border was lined with bases for spies and agents, where a large number of former Zogu reactionary officers, war criminals, and reactionary exiled landlords were kept. They used methods such as aerial drops and smuggling by small wooden boats to send their henchmen into Albania to incite, sabotage, and assassinate. The Tito gang and the Greek royalist fascists, with their support, constantly carried out armed provocations on the border. From 1949 to 1952, the number of land, sea, and air intrusions against Albania by surrounding enemies reached more than 920. American planes taking off from Italian bases intruded into Albanian airspace more than 300 times to drop reactionary leaflets.

However, the heroic Albanian people were not intimidated by the enemy's threats. They are an inseparable part of the powerful world peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union. The Albanian people, tested in long battles, guarded the border vigilantly with infinite loyalty to the cause of the people and peace. They are always ready to give any enemy who dares to invade their country a head-on blow. In the battle to repel a large-scale provocation by Greece in August 1949, the People's Army killed or wounded more than 150 enemy soldiers.

"To build our new life, we must hold a shovel in one hand and a gun in the other"—Comrade Hoxha's instruction has now become the slogan of action for the entire Albanian people in their struggle and work. In the villages near the border, I once again felt the vigorous fighting atmosphere like we had in the struggle in the border regions in the past. The Albanian militiamen, wearing white Islamic felt hats, bullet belts around their waists, and rifles slung across their backs, left a very deep impression on me. They are not only brave fighters defending local security and hunting down spies and agents, but also capable people on the production front. Quima Ganbo, chairman of the "Patriot" Production Cooperative in Bidnie Village near Lake Ohrid (half of the lake belongs to Albania and half to Yugoslavia), told me the story of how their village caught spies:

On March 15, 1952, it was snowing. That morning, the duty officer of the cooperative saw a dark shadow flashing across the mountain. He became suspicious and went up the mountain to look for it. Not far from the hill was a cave, and he saw the dark shadow disappear into the cave. He immediately returned to report. Only nine people were at home in our village that day. One person was sent to report to the border guards, and the rest prepared their weapons and went up the mountain to surround the cave. After a while, the troops arrived. We threw grenades into the cave.

"We surrender..." someone shouted from the cave.

"Come out and we won't kill you," the captain ordered, "Raise your hands!"

Three spies came out of the cave with their hands raised. These three guys were carrying American submachine guns, pistols, and British grenades. They confessed that they had come from Greece. Their mission was to gather intelligence, assassinate government officials, and spread rumors. This was the fifth time they had sneaked across the border, hiding in the cave during the day, preparing to be active at night....

There are many examples of ordinary people catching spies. In a neighboring village, an old shepherd lured three spies to his house to sleep, then set fire to the house, burning the spies to death in the house....

III. Transforming a Backward Agricultural Country into an Agricultural-Industrial Country

Albania's geographical conditions are indeed unfavorable for its economic construction. But geographical conditions cannot determine the fate of the people. The liberated Albanian people, under the leadership of their leader Hoxha and the Labor Party, and with the selfless and vigorous assistance of the great Soviet Union, are transforming this country, which has always been the most backward in Southeastern Europe, into an advanced and prosperous country.

Albania began its first Five-Year Plan in 1951. What we saw throughout Albania was like a large-scale factory, with workers, peasants, and all laborers carrying out intense construction according to the plan. The new hydroelectric power station on the Mati River, named after Enver Hoxha, is currently the center of construction. After completion, this power station will have a generating capacity of 20,000 kilowatts, more than four times larger than the Lenin Hydroelectric Power Station built in 1952. The high-voltage power lines erected from there will spread throughout the central cities all the way to the Stalin Oilfield. 12,000 young men and women volunteers built a new 25-kilometer-long highway along Milot to the site of the hydroelectric power station—Urz. This highway, named "Road of Light," was completed on October 16, 1952, the 44th birthday of Comrade Hoxha.

We visited the Five-Year Plan Exhibition Hall at the Palace of Culture in Tirana. There we saw the explanation written in large characters: "The main task of the Five-Year Plan in industry is: to accelerate the socialist economic construction at a faster pace and prepare the socialist foundation. At the end of the Five-Year Plan, our country will be transformed from a backward agricultural country into an agricultural-industrial country."

The exhibition also displayed detailed charts on economic construction and cultural development in the Five-Year Plan: the total investment in the national economy is 21 billion leks (one lek is approximately equivalent to 500 RMB), including 11 billion leks in industry and 8.158 billion leks in agriculture. This figure is equivalent to three times the investment in the national economy from 1946 to 1950. The charts show that industrial production in 1952 was already seven and a half times that of pre-war levels, and by 1955 it will be 339 percent of the 1950 level, which is more than twelve times the pre-war 1938 level. Agricultural output will be 171 percent of the 1950 level, which is twice that of pre-war levels. A large amount of water conservancy will be built during the Five-Year Plan. The newly dug canals will irrigate 83,000 hectares of farmland. These measures will expand the sown area in 1955 by 540 percent compared to 1950. By the end of the Five-Year Plan, the national income is expected to reach 19 billion leks, which is two and a half times the national income in 1950. The proportion of industry and agriculture in the national economy will also change. In 1938, industry accounted for 18.3 percent and agriculture accounted for 81.7 percent; in 1952, industry accounted for 52.6 percent and agriculture accounted for 47.4 percent; by 1955, industry will account for 55 percent and agriculture will account for 45 percent.

The Albanian people were once considered "the most poorly dressed people in Europe," but this statement is no longer true. Now, various beautiful and durable fabrics made of domestic cotton yarn and printed with the words "Made by Stalin Textile Factory" are sold throughout the country. This textile factory is entirely equipped with the latest Soviet-style combined textile machines. It has 21,000 spindles and produces 20 million meters of cloth annually, an average of about 20 meters per person in the country.

In terms of transportation, Albania was the only country in Europe without railways in the past. Transportation relied almost entirely on donkeys and horses. Now Albania has built four railways. With the completion of the Five-Year Plan, a new 90-kilometer-long railway will be built from the southern port of Vlora to the Mëmëlia coal mining area. Where there are no railways, road transport is also well-developed. Beautiful and comfortable buses run back and forth, connecting the cities throughout the country. Large-scale exploration and drilling projects are underway at the Stalin-Patos oil field near Mount Tomorr. Oil production is increasing month by month. In addition to the old pipeline leading to the port of Vlora, a second, larger pipeline has now been built. The new Çirik oil refinery near Mount Elbasan is also under construction.

The heroic Albanian people are tenaciously carrying out peaceful construction in a fighting posture under the environment of enemy encirclement. They deeply know that every victory they have achieved in the cause of peaceful construction is a heavy blow to imperialism and an obstacle to the warmongers' path to war.

    在战斗中建设
    ——阿尔巴尼亚访问记
    孔东平
    一、“游击队之宫”
    在阿尔巴尼亚首都地拉那附近的一座小山丘上，有一座建筑得富丽堂皇的王宫，这里过去曾是反动统治者作威作福的地方。解放以后，这座王宫已改名为“游击队之宫”。每逢年节，阿尔巴尼亚劳动人民便在这里和他们敬爱的领袖们欢聚，共同庆祝自己的节日。
    一九五二年十一月二十九日，我随我国中央人民政府代表黄镇将军前往地拉那参加了阿尔巴尼亚解放八周年纪念的庆祝典礼。这天，在广场上举行了盛大的检阅和示威游行。晚上，阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国部长会议主席、阿尔巴尼亚劳动党总书记恩维尔·霍查，在“游击队之宫”举行盛大宴会，招待各国政府代表团。参加宴会的除劳动党和政府各部门负责人外，还有来自各地的工、农业劳动模范、老革命战士和烈士家属们以及宗教领袖。这是一个十分动人的场面。整个会场就像一个大家庭。宾主们宴罢，大家都手牵着手围成一个大圆圈，纵情地跳着阿尔巴尼亚民族舞。工人、农民、军官、战士们围在一起，他们引吭高唱着古老的民歌和老游击队歌曲，回忆着英勇战斗的日子；唱罢，互相热情地吻抱不止。
    部长会议副主席谢胡同志身旁坐着一位一百○八岁的老农民。他是从北部托波伊亚山区来的。他过去是反抗土耳其和佐古反动派（佐古是阿尔巴尼亚过去的国王）的老革命战士。老头子精神很好，但耳朵不大灵了。他目光炯炯地突然握着拳头，大声地说：“我们在南斯拉夫的一百万阿尔巴尼亚同胞一日得不到解放，我死也不瞑目。”老人心中充满了对铁托匪帮的憎恨！在这庆祝解放八周年的狂欢之夜，不知有多少在南斯拉夫境内的阿尔巴尼亚族居民正在铁托的集中营里遭受酷刑！
    托波伊亚山区是反法西斯战争中游击队的根据地之一。霍查同志不久以前曾访问过那里。他向一个名叫苏里玛的农民说：“请你告诉我，在你们每天的生活中，最重要的事是什么？”
    “我们献身劳动，为了让党更坚强，像过去一样坚定不屈地战斗。”苏里玛回答说，“我们绝不容许谁来侵犯。您什么时候召唤我们，我们就拿起武器。您知道，我们山地老百姓个个都会拿枪，我们每个人都誓死要捍卫祖国，捍卫和平。”
    这就是阿尔巴尼亚人民的声音。这就是这个年青人民共和国的力量的源泉。
    二、一手拿枪，一手建设
    第二次世界大战结束之后，阿尔巴尼亚人民开始在极端困难的条件下建设自己的祖国。但是穷凶极恶的美、英帝国主义者却不让阿尔巴尼亚人民有建设自己的新生活的机会。他们纠集了阿尔巴尼亚周围的一切反动势力——铁托匪帮、希腊保皇法西斯、意大利、土耳其反动政府，形成对阿尔巴尼亚的四面包围和封锁。沿着阿尔巴尼亚边境布满了特务间谍的基地，在那里豢养着大批佐古反动派旧军官、战争罪犯和反动流亡地主。他们利用飞机空降和小木船偷渡等办法，派遣他们的爪牙潜入阿尔巴尼亚境内进行煽动、破坏和暗杀。在他们支持下的铁托匪帮和希腊保皇法西斯，不断在边境上进行武装挑衅。从一九四九年到一九五二年，周围敌人对阿尔巴尼亚陆、海、空的侵犯即达九百二十多次。从意大利基地起飞的美国飞机，侵入阿国领空投散反动传单达三百多次。
    然而，英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民并没有被敌人的恫吓所吓倒。他们是以苏联为首的强大的世界和平、民主阵营中不可分割的部分。久经战斗考验的阿尔巴尼亚人民以对人民与和平事业的无限忠诚，警惕地守卫着边疆。他们随时准备给胆敢侵犯他们祖国的任何敌人以迎头痛击。在一九四九年八月反击希腊的一次大规模挑衅的战斗中，人民军曾杀伤敌人一百五十多名。
    “建设我们的新生活要一手拿铲，一手拿枪”——霍查同志的这一指示，现在已成为阿尔巴尼亚全国人民战斗与工作的行动口号了。在靠近国境线的村庄里，我重新感到了像我们过去在边沿区斗争中的那种蓬勃的战斗气氛。头带白色回教小毡帽，腰佩子弹袋，倒背着步枪的阿尔巴尼亚民兵，给我留下极深刻的印象。他们不仅是保卫地方治安、猎捕间谍特务的勇敢战士，同时也是生产战线上的能手。奥里湖（湖的一半属阿尔巴尼亚，一半属南斯拉夫）附近比丁聂村的“爱国者”生产合作社主席奎玛·甘波，把他们村子抓特务的故事告诉了我：
    一九五二年三月十五日，下雪天。这天早晨，合作社值日员看见山上有个黑影闪过，他起了疑心，就上山去找。离小山不远有个山洞，他看见那个黑影钻进洞里去了。他马上回来报告。这天我们村里只有九个人在家，派了一个人去报告边防军，其余都准备好武器，上山包围洞子。一会，部队赶来了。我们就向洞里扔手雷。
    “我们投降……”洞里有人叫喊起来。
    “出来就不杀你们”，队长命令道：“把手举起来！”
    三个特务举着双手钻出洞来了。这三个家伙都带着美国冲锋枪、手枪和英国手榴弹。他们供认是从希腊来的。任务是搜集情报、暗杀政府负责人、散布谣言。他们这次是第五次偷过边境，白天躲在洞里，准备在夜间活动……。
    老百姓抓特务的例子很多。邻村有一个放羊的老头，把三个特务引到他家里睡觉，自己放火烧了房子，把特务也烧死在房子里……。
    三、变落后的农业国为农业—工业国
    阿尔巴尼亚的地理条件对于她的经济建设的确是不利的。但地理条件并不能决定人民的命运。解放了的阿尔巴尼亚人民，在他们的领袖霍查和劳动党的领导下，在伟大苏联无私的大力帮助下，把这个一向是东南欧最落后的国家正改造成为先进的、繁荣兴盛的国家。
    阿尔巴尼亚从一九五一年开始了第一个五年计划。我们所看到的整个阿尔巴尼亚就像一座大规模的工场，工人、农民以及所有的劳动者都按照计划进行着紧张的建设。麦蒂河畔以恩维尔·霍查为名的新水力发电站是目前建设的中心。这个发电站建成之后，发电能力为二万瓩，比一九五二年建成的列宁水电站要大四倍以上。从那里架设出来的高压电线，将遍布中部各城直到斯大林油田。一万二千名男女青年志愿劳动队员，沿着米洛特到水力发电站所在地——乌尔兹，修筑了一条长达二十五公里的新公路。这条取名为“光明之路”的公路，已于一九五二年十月十六日，即霍查同志四十四岁诞辰日完成了。
    我们参观了在地拉那文化宫举行的五年计划展览室。那里我们看到了用大字写着的说明：“五年计划工业的主要任务是：以更加快的速度加紧社会主义经济建设，准备社会主义基础。五年计划终了，我国将从落后的农业国转变为农业—工业国。”
    展览会上还陈列着关于五年计划中经济建设与文化发展方面的详细图表：国民经济方面的投资总额二百一十亿里克（一里克约合人民币五百元），其中包括工业方面的投资一百一十亿里克，农业方面的投资八十一亿五千八百万里克。这项数字相当于一九四六年到一九五○年国民经济投资的三倍。图表显示：工业生产量在一九五二年已为战前的七倍半，到一九五五年将为一九五○年水平的百分之三百三十九，即超过战前一九三八年十二倍。农业产量将为一九五○年水平的百分之一百七十一，即比战前增加二倍。在五年计划中将大量兴修水利。新凿的运河所灌溉的农田将达八万三千公顷，这些措施，将使一九五五年的播种面积比一九五○年扩大百分之五百四十。到五年计划终了时，国民收入预计将达一百九十亿里克，即比一九五○年国民收入增加二倍半。国民经济中工业与农业的比重也将发生变化。一九三八年工业占百分之十八点三，农业占百分之八十一点七；一九五二年工业五十二点六，农业四十七点四；到一九五五年，工业将占五十五，农业占四十五。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民过去曾被认为是“欧洲穿得最不好的人民”，如今这个说法已和事实不符了。现在，用本国棉纱织成的印有“斯大林纺织工厂出品”字样的各种漂亮、坚实的布料已销行全国。这个纺织工厂全部是用苏联最新式的联合纺织机装备起来的，它拥有二万一千纱锭，年产二千万公尺布，平均全国每人约可得二十公尺。
    在交通运输方面，过去阿尔巴尼亚是欧洲唯一没有铁路的国家，运输几乎全靠毛驴和马匹。现在阿尔巴尼亚已筑成四条铁路。随着五年计划的完成，将又出现一条从南部港口瓦洛拉到眉玛利亚斯煤矿区长达九十公里的新铁路。在没有铁路的地方，公路运输也很发达。美丽舒适的公共汽车来往奔驰，沟通了全国各城市间的联系。托摩里山附近的斯大林—巴托斯油田正在展开着大规模的勘测和钻井工程。石油产量逐月增加着，除旧有的通向瓦洛拉港的油管外，第二条更大的油管现在已建设起来。爱尔巴山附近的柴立克新炼油厂也正在建筑中。
                        ×××
    英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民在敌人包围的环境下，以战斗的姿态顽强地进行着和平建设。他们深深知道：他们在和平建设事业中所取得的每一个胜利，对于帝国主义都是一个沉重的打击，是战争贩子发动战争道路上的障碍。
