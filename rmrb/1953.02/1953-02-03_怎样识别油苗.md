How to Identify Oil Seeps

Editor's Note: To help the masses effectively report mineral discoveries, this newspaper will continue to invite the Ministry of Geology of the Central People's Government to answer basic knowledge about identifying various mineral deposits.

Question: How do you identify oil seeps?

Answer: Oil seeps are the phenomenon of underground petroleum or its related substances such as natural gas, paraffin wax, asphalt, etc., appearing on the surface. These substances often emerge on the surface along rock fissures or the banks of rivers, and are also easily discovered when digging water wells. Petroleum is dark brown or yellowish-brown, smells like kerosene or gasoline, and burns with a smoky flame; paraffin wax is yellowish-white, like everyday candles, and odorless; asphalt is a black solid that melts when heated; natural gas is a gas that emerges from the ground and is flammable. It should be noted that we sometimes encounter oil slick-like substances floating in water, which, when stirred with a branch, disperse into solid flakes with a brownish sediment underneath; however, if these oil slicks do not ignite or smell like kerosene when burned, they are not oil seeps.

If we discover or are certain that there are oil seeps in a location, this indicates that there may be good petroleum reserves there. We should report this as information for the national petroleum industry development plan. However, the discovery of oil seeps does not indicate the amount of reserves. Therefore, whether this oil seep has exploitation value needs to be further determined based on geological conditions and scientific and technological exploration capabilities.

    怎样识别油苗
    编者按：为帮助群众有效地进行报矿工作，本报将继续约请中央人民政府地质部解答识别各种矿藏的基本知识。
    问：怎样识别油苗？
    答：油苗是地下的石油或它的同类物如天然气、石腊、沥青等出露地表的现象。这些东西经常沿着岩石的裂缝或河流的两岸出现到地表上来，有时挖水井时也容易发现。石油是黑褐色或黄褐色，嗅之有煤油气或汽油味，燃起来火有烟；石腊是黄白色，像日常所用的腊烛一样，嗅之无味；沥青是黑色固体，遇火即熔化；天然气是地下冒出来的气体，遇火即燃烧。应该注意的是我们有时遇到水中漂浮着油花似的东西，以树枝搅动它，便散成固体薄片，而且下面有褐色的沉淀；但这些油花燃之既不起火，也无煤油味，则并非油苗。
    如果我们发现或确切知道那里有油苗，这就说明那里可能有很好的石油储藏着。我们就应该报告，作为国家石油工业开发计划的资料。但发现了油苗，却不能说明储藏量的多少。因此这个油苗有无开采价值，还有待进一步根据地质情形和科学技术勘测能力来决定。
