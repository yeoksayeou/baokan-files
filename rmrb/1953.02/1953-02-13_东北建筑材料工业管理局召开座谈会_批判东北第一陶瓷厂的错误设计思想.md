    Northeast Architectural Materials Industry Bureau Holds Symposium
    Criticizing the Erroneous Design Ideology of Northeast First Ceramic Factory
    The Northeast Architectural Materials Industry Bureau convened a symposium of engineering and technical personnel to examine the erroneous design ideology in a relatively concrete manner, focusing on the erroneous design of the Northeast First Ceramic Factory.
    Wu Guangzhi, Deputy Director of the Northeast Architectural Materials Industry Bureau, spoke first at the symposium, demanding that design departments learn from the lessons of the First Ceramic Factory's design work, conduct a comprehensive review of their work, expose various erroneous designs, and criticize various erroneous ideologies, in order to improve work and enhance design quality. At the symposium, the designers responsible for the design of the First Ceramic Factory all made self-criticisms. Li Baozi, the engineer responsible for the design of the crushing plant, said: "For the sake of convenience in construction, I designed the crushing plant in a sixteen-sided shape. However, I did not consider whether transportation would be convenient or how difficult the mechanical installation would be. After I finished the design and the workers built the factory building, it turned out that the machines could not fit in. We had to open the walls to install the machinery. This is because my irresponsibility caused a great loss of state property." The columns in the First Ceramic Factory that could be used for five hundred years were designed by Liu Quanzhang. Liu Quanzhang reviewed his design ideology at the meeting. He said: "I designed such thick columns partly because I was afraid of taking responsibility, fearing that if the columns broke in the future, I would be ‘held accountable.’ Therefore, I adopted an excessively large safety factor, making the cross-section of the columns very large. On the other hand, I completely followed the bourgeois norms to determine the safety factor of the columns. From the bourgeois point of view, such a safety factor is ‘reasonable,’ but from the working-class point of view, this is a great waste. The year before last, when I participated in the design conference of the Northeast Industrial Department, I even doubted the new design standards, believing that the safety factor stipulated by the Soviet Union was too small and too dangerous. Later, I heard my classmates talk about the advanced design of the Harbin Linen Factory, and I began to understand the superiority of the Soviet design standards. Now, as I read Soviet design work books, I have discovered the backwardness of our past designs. If I had accepted the advanced Soviet experience earlier, I would not have designed such columns that wasted state property. This is a big lesson."
    The engineering and technical personnel who participated in the symposium also criticized Zhao Guangxin's erroneous ideology, who was in charge of leading the design work of the First Ceramic Factory. Zhao Guangxin used to study electrical engineering. The higher-ups wanted him to design machinery, and he thought: "Although I haven't studied machinery, can't I still do machinery design with my abilities?" So he presumptuously accepted the task of designing the First Ceramic Factory. Before starting the design, he did not understand the ceramic production process, nor did he know how much work was involved or how many workers were needed, so he blindly proceeded with the design. Qi Jun, Deputy Director of the Northeast Architectural Materials Industry Bureau, proposed a circular crushing plant plan and sought Zhao Guangxin's opinion. Zhao Guangxin knew that the circular shape was not as good as the linear shape, but he thought: "Since the higher-ups proposed the circular shape, why should I object?" So he agreed to design it in a circular shape. In such a circular crushing plant, installing machinery is relatively difficult. Zhao Guangxin did not report this difficulty to the higher-ups. He felt: "How can a capable person like me, Zhao Guangxin, say there are difficulties?" Dominated by this conceited ideology, he made an erroneous design. When engineer Wang Zhenyu criticized Zhao Guangxin's erroneous ideology, he also made a self-criticism, saying: "In order to cater to the intentions of the higher-ups, Zhao Guangxin did not ask whether the design was correct or not, regardless of how much state property would be lost, and erroneously made the design of the First Ceramic Factory. At that time, I knew that Zhao Guangxin's thinking style was not upright, but I didn't dare to offer opinions or fight against erroneous ideology. This is an irresponsible attitude."
    The engineering and technical personnel also criticized the errors on the leadership side, and at the same time exposed the shortcomings of the Eighth Cement Plant design. Shen Jiefu said: "When designing the First Ceramic Factory, we did not consider subjective strengths and did not create careful plans or an overall design. Our leadership side, in order to rush construction, adopted the erroneous practice of designing and constructing at the same time. This blind activism caused the errors in the First Ceramic Factory's design. Today, we have not fully learned this lesson. When designing factories, we still do not pay attention to geological data and design blindly. When we make this year's basic construction plan, we still think that some geological data is unnecessary to collect. Therefore, when drilling a well, we discovered that there was rock underground and no water, so we had to redo the work. Hou Baoting, Deputy Director of the Design Department, then reviewed the shortcomings in the leadership work. He said: "When designing the Eighth Cement Plant, we still did not learn from past lessons and also made many mistakes. Civil construction and electrical aspects still did not cooperate with each other. For example, the substation has a small house. The electrical aspect designed the generator in this small house, while the civil construction aspect designed the boiler in this small house. Also, the civil construction aspect drew a line on the construction drawing without indicating what the line was. The construction side thought it was the ground level and blindly carried out the construction. As a result, the finished concrete foundation was much higher, so the excess part had to be removed. We once sent people to the Eighth Cement Plant to solicit workers' opinions on the plant's design. The workers raised more than one hundred opinions, exposing the serious phenomena of carelessness, sloppiness, and irresponsibility in our work. We inspected seventy drawings of the Eighth Cement Plant and found that fifty of them had problems. Such a design is extremely harmful to national construction." Hou Baoting requested that engineering and technical personnel seriously inspect their work, criticize erroneous ideologies, and push the design work forward.

    东北建筑材料工业管理局召开座谈会
    批判东北第一陶瓷厂的错误设计思想
    东北建筑材料工业管理局召集工程技术人员举行座谈会，以东北第一陶瓷厂的错误设计为讨论中心，比较具体地检查了错误的设计思想。
    东北建筑材料工业管理局副局长吴光治首先在座谈会上发言，要求设计部门吸取第一陶瓷厂设计工作的教训，普遍检查工作，揭发各种错误的设计，批判各种错误的思想，以便改进工作，提高设计的质量。座谈会上，负责设计第一陶瓷厂的设计人员都作了自我批评。负责设计粉碎厂的工程师李宝滋说：“我为了建筑上的方便，把粉碎厂设计成十六角型的，但我没有考虑运输便利与否，机械安装的困难如何。当我设计好了之后，工人们盖好了厂房，却放不下机器，只好把墙壁打开，安装机械。这是因为我不负责任使国家财产受到了很大的损失。”第一陶瓷厂可用五百年的柱子是刘全章设计的。刘全章在会上检查了他的设计思想。他说：“我设计这样粗大的柱子，一方面是因为自己怕负责任，怕将来柱子坏了，自己要‘沾包’，于是采用过大的安全系数，把柱子的断面弄得很大；另一面我是完全按照资产阶级的规范来确定柱子的安全系数的，从资产阶级的观点来看，这样的安全系数是‘合理的’，但从工人阶级的观点来看，这是极大的浪费。前年我在参加东北工业部的设计会议时，还怀疑新的设计标准，认为苏联规定的安全系数太小，太危险。后来，我听到同学谈到哈尔滨亚麻厂的先进的设计的情形，才初步了解苏联设计标准的优越性。现在我阅读苏联设计工作的书籍，更发现我们过去在设计中的落后现象。我如果早接受苏联先进经验，也不会设计出那样浪费国家财产的柱子了。这是一个很大的教训。”
    参加座谈会的工程技术人员还批判了领导第一陶瓷厂设计工作的赵光炘的错误思想。赵光炘过去是学电机工程的。上级要他设计机械，他想：“虽没有学过机械，但凭我这样，还干不了机械的设计吗？”他就自负地接受了第一陶瓷厂设计的任务。动手设计之前，他不去了解陶瓷的生产过程，也不晓得有多少工作量，需要多少工人，就盲目进行设计。东北建筑材料工业管理局副局长祁俊提出圆形粉碎厂的方案，征求赵光炘的意见。赵光炘明知道圆形的不如一列式的好，但他想：“既然上级提出圆形的，我何必反对呢？”因此他同意设计成圆形的。在这样的圆形粉碎厂内，安装机器是比较困难的。赵光炘不向上级反映这个困难问题，他觉得：“像我赵光炘这样的能手，能说困难吗？”在这种自高自大的思想支配之下，他做出了错误的设计。王振玉工程师在批评赵光炘这种错误思想时，也作了自我批评，他说：“赵光炘为了迎合上级的意图，不问设计正确与否，不管国家财产遭受多大损失，就错误地做出了第一陶瓷厂的设计。当时，我知道赵光炘思想作风不正派，也不敢提意见，不敢向错误思想作斗争。这是一种不负责任的态度。”
    工程技术人员对领导方面的错误，也提出了批评，同时揭发了第八水泥厂设计的缺点。沈介夫说：“设计第一陶瓷厂时，根本没有考虑主观的力量，没有做周密的计划和总体设计。我们领导方面为了急于施工，采取了一面设计一面施工的错误的做法。这种盲目积极性，就造成了第一陶瓷厂设计的错误。在今天，我们还没有完全吸取这个教训。我们在设计工厂时，仍然不重视地质资料，盲目设计。我们做今年基本建设计划时，总还认为有些地质资料是不必搜集的。因此在打井时，发现井下是岩石，没有水，只好重新返工。设计处副处长侯宝廷接着检讨了领导工作中的缺点。他说：“在设计第八水泥厂时，我们仍然没有吸取以往的教训，也犯了很多错误。土木建筑方面和电气方面依然不互相配合。例如变电所有个小房子。电气方面把发电机设计在这个小房子内，而土木建筑方面又把锅炉设计在这个小房子内。又如土木建筑方面在施工图上，画了一根线，没有注明是什么线。施工方面却以为是地平线，就盲目地施了工。结果，做好的混凝土基础高了很多，只得把高出的部分铲去。我们曾经派人到第八水泥厂，征求工人对该厂设计的意见。工人们提了一百多条意见，揭发了我们在工作中的马虎草率、不负责任的严重现象。我们检查了第八水泥厂的七十张图纸，发现其中五十张图纸有毛病。这样的设计，对于国家建设是极其有害的。”侯宝廷要求工程技术人员认真检查工作，批判错误思想，把设计工作向前推进一步。
