    An Indestructible Fortress in the Struggle for Peace and Friendship Among Nations
    People's Artist of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, Stalin Prize Winner, Conductor of the Red Flag Song and Dance Ensemble of the Soviet Army, Bao Ya. Alexandrov
    Last October, all members of the Red Flag Song and Dance Ensemble of the Soviet Army, named after A.V. Alexandrov, departed for the People's Republic of China with extraordinary excitement. In the more than twenty years since the Red Flag Song and Dance Ensemble was founded, we have toured many European countries, but this was our first visit to China.
    We will never forget the days we spent in our friendly country, the People's Republic of China, nor will we forget the warm hospitality and the excitement with which the working people of this great country welcomed us. The citizens of free China regarded us as representatives of the heroic Soviet Army, which is defending the interests and tranquility of the hundreds of millions of peace-loving Soviet people and the fraternal nations of the people's democracies. The Red Flag Song and Dance Ensemble prepared a rich program for its visit to China, which included not only songs by Soviet composers dedicated to the Soviet Army, but also works about the peaceful and constructive labor of the Soviet people. We held sixty performances in China, attended by about one million people.
    Our trip to the People's Republic of China and our meetings with representatives of various strata of the Chinese people made us aware of the enormous and truly unprecedented scale of the work related to the Chinese people's construction of a happy new life. In a very short period of time, only three years in total, this great country has achieved great achievements under the leadership of the Communist Party and its leader, Comrade Mao Zedong.
    We saw many huge people's construction projects in which thousands upon thousands of workers and peasants participated. People told us about the construction and restoration of dikes that prevented floods that had caused great damage to the national economy. We saw scaffolding everywhere, where new houses, public utilities, factories, schools and universities were being built. This nation, which has overthrown centuries of oppression, is working with great enthusiasm and strength to build a new life.
    With the development of the economy, the people's creativity is also flourishing. The working people who have obtained jobs are full of confidence in tomorrow and in the bright future of their country. They express their joy and happiness in songs and dances, in various theatrical performances, and praise the Communist Party and the Chinese people's leader, Mao Zedong, for striving for a new life for them. In almost all the cities we visited, we saw performances by various Chinese amateur art troupes, all of which have many talented artists.
    During our visit to China, we visited many interesting performances of classical and modern operas that are loved by the people. We were deeply impressed by the opera "The White-Haired Girl" performed by the actors of the Beijing People's Art Theater. These song and dance ensembles are very popular in China. The repertoire of the song and dance ensembles includes patriotic and heroic songs, some describing the selfless work of the hardworking Chinese people, some describing the construction of a new life, some describing the struggle against feudal remnants, and some describing the blows against those enemies who attempt to obstruct peace and friendly coexistence among the people and countries of the world.
    The Soviet artists received a warm and courteous reception in China. We were deeply touched by the care and attention of our friends. The mutual visits and performances of Chinese and Soviet artists are of great significance in further developing the friendship and cultural ties between the great Chinese and Soviet people. The people of the two countries are better and more deeply understanding each other's achievements in art and culture, learning from each other's good experiences, and applying them in their own work.
    For example, we learned and performed some Chinese songs in China, especially folk songs praising Mao Zedong, and Qu Xixian's "People of the World Are of One Heart." We are very happy to see that many songs written by Soviet composers, especially "Moscow-Beijing" written by Murateli to dedicate to the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people, are very popular among the Chinese working people.
    We are starting to prepare a new program, which includes works by Chinese composers and Chinese folk songs and dances, as well as works by Soviet composers. This program about the friendship between the two great nations will be performed in May this year.
    The people of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China account for almost one-third of the world's population! All good people in the world congratulate the friendship between our two strong and great nations, and they regard this friendship as an indestructible fortress in the struggle for peace and friendship among nations. This friendship marks a truly strong force in the cause of defending peace. May the friendship between these two great nations, the friendship between these two heroic nations, continue to develop and prosper! (Translated by Wen Qi)

    争取和平与各民族友好的斗争中的不可摧毁的堡垒
    俄罗斯苏维埃联邦社会主义共和国人民演员  斯大林奖金获得者苏军红旗歌舞团团长  鲍·亚·亚历山大罗夫
    去年十月，以亚·弗·亚历山大罗夫为名的苏军红旗歌舞团全体团员们，怀着异常激动的心情出发到了中华人民共和国。在红旗歌舞团成立以来二十多年的时间内，我们曾多次到欧洲各国作巡回演出，但我们访问中国却是第一次。
    我们永远不会忘记我们在我们的友邦中华人民共和国度过的那些日子，不会忘记那样热忱的招待，不会忘记这个伟大国家的劳动人民迎接我们时所怀的那种兴奋。自由中国的公民，将我们看作正在捍卫着亿万爱好和平的苏联人民与人民民主国家各兄弟民族利益与安宁的英勇苏军的代表。红旗歌舞团团员准备了丰富的节目到中国来，在这些节目里，不但有苏联作曲家献给苏联军队的歌曲，而且有关于苏联人民的和平建设性劳动的作品。在中国我们举行了六十次表演会，出席这些表演会的观众约有一百万人。
    我们在中华人民共和国的旅行以及与中国人民各个不同阶层代表的见面，使我们认识到与中国人民建设幸福新生活相关的工作底巨大的、真正空前的规模。在极短的时期内，总共不过三年，这个伟大的国家在共产党及其领袖毛泽东同志的领导下，已经获得了巨大的成就。
    我们看到了有成千成万工人和农民参加的许多巨大的人民建设工程，人们向我们讲述了防水堤坝建筑和恢复的情形，这些防水堤坝防止了曾给国民经济带来巨大损害的水灾。我们到处看到了建筑架，那里正在建造新的住宅、公用企业、工厂、学校和大学。这个推翻了多少世纪的压迫的民族，正怀着巨大的热情和力量，努力地建造着新的生活。
    随着经济的发展，人民的创作也蓬勃地高涨起来。获得了工作的劳动人民，对于明天，对于自己国家底光辉的未来，满怀着信心。他们在歌舞中，在各种戏剧演出中表达自己的喜悦和幸福，赞美为他们争取新的生活的共产党和中国人民领袖毛泽东。差不多在我们所访问的所有城市中，我们都看到了各种中国业余艺术团体的演出，这些艺术团体都拥有许许多多的天才艺术家。
    在访问中国的时期，我们参观了许多为人民所热爱的古典歌剧和现代歌剧的饶有兴趣的演出。北京人民艺术剧院演员所演出的歌剧“白毛女”给我们留下了深刻的印象。这些歌舞团在中国是非常受人欢迎的。在歌舞团的演出节目中，有那些爱国的、豪迈的歌曲，有的是描写勤劳的中国人民的忘我的工作，有的是描写新生活的建设，有的是描写和封建残余的斗争，有的是描写对那些企图阻碍人民和世界各国和平友好共处的敌人的打击。
    苏联的艺术家们在中国受到了热诚而殷勤的招待。我们朋友的关心和照顾，深深地感动了我们。中苏两国艺术家的互相访问和演出，在进一步发展伟大的中苏人民的友谊与文化联系上，是具有重大意义的。两国人民在更好地和更深刻地相互了解艺术与文化方面的成就，彼此学习好的经验，并运用在自己的工作中。
    举例说，我们曾经学会了并在中国表演了一些中国歌曲，特别是歌唱毛泽东的民歌，瞿希贤的“全世界人民心一条”。我们很高兴，看到许多苏联作曲家作的歌曲，特别是莫拉特里为献给中苏人民友谊而作的“莫斯科——北京”受到中国劳动人民极大的欢迎。
    我们正在开始准备一个新的节目单，其中有中国作曲家的作品和中国的民间歌曲与舞蹈，同时也有苏联作曲家的作品。这关于两大民族的友好的节目，将在今年五月里演出。
    苏联和中华人民共和国的人民几乎占了地球人口的三分之一！全世界善良的人们都为我们两个雄强、伟大的民族的友好而祝贺，他们把这种友谊看成为争取和平与各民族友好的斗争中不可摧毁的堡垒。这种友谊标志着保卫和平事业中真正坚强的力量。祝这两个伟大民族的友谊，两个英雄民族的友谊继续发展和繁荣！    （文杞译）
