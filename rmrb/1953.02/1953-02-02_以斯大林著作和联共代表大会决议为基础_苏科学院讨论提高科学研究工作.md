Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 1st—TASS reports: The Soviet Academy of Sciences held a conference on January 30th at the Central Club of Scientific Workers in Moscow to discuss various measures to improve scientific research work based on Stalin's work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR" and the resolutions of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Prominent representatives of the Soviet scientific community, heads of various institutes and laboratories, and representatives of higher education institutions attended the conference.

The conference was opened by Ivan P. Bardin, Vice President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences.

Alexander N. Nesmeyanov, President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, delivered a report on the tasks of the Soviet Academy of Sciences in light of the resolutions of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. He said, "To accomplish the great tasks set by the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union for the new Five-Year Plan period, the workers of all departments of the scientific community need to participate very actively in the work. In the Soviet Union, science plays a role that it has never played in the entire history of mankind." Nesmeyanov pointed out that the aspirations of Soviet scientists are to strive to utilize the Soviet Union's natural wealth, to improve the geographical distribution of industrial enterprises, to comprehensively study and develop new vast areas, and to transform nature for the benefit of the Soviet people who are building communism.

Nesmeyanov said that special attention will be paid to various fundamental issues related to opening up new prospects for the further development of science. On the basis of the latest achievements in chemistry, physical chemistry, physics, and other sciences, research on the laws governing the distribution of useful minerals will be conducted on a larger scale. Fundamental issues related to the origin, evolution, structure, and radioactivity of the Earth, cosmic evolution, and geology will occupy a particularly important place in the research work. To implement the tasks set by the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union regarding the development of the coal mining industry, it is necessary to study the theory of coal mining in deep strata and the working techniques in open-pit mines. To design highly efficient high-speed machines, scientists must adopt completely new calculation methods, new methods for determining machine stress, deformation, and vibration, and delve into the theory of the most important production processes, such as metal cutting and pressure processing. In the main departments of power engineering, Soviet scientists will concentrate their efforts on further studying the problem of establishing high-voltage systems in the Soviet Union. Regarding biological theory, the most important are: research on the laws of metabolism, research on the process of protein biosynthesis, and research on the formation of enzymes and the origin of non-cellular and cellular forms of living matter. Speaking of the achievements of social sciences, Nesmeyanov pointed out that Soviet history has raised and studied many new issues that can only be solved on the basis of Marxist-Leninist social development theory. The study of the history of the revolutionary movement of the working masses is one of the great achievements of Soviet history. In the future, the study of the development of the democratic world market and the economic cooperation between socialist and democratic countries is one of the tasks of Soviet economists. Soviet linguists must solve many of the most important theoretical problems in accordance with the guidelines put forward by Stalin's work "Marxism and Problems of Linguistics."

Nesmeyanov concluded by saying that Soviet scientists will spare no effort to fulfill the expectations of the Communist Party and the Soviet people. Soviet science will surely accomplish its historical mission and will stand at the forefront of world science.

The conference then began to discuss the various issues raised in Nesmeyanov's report.

The Soviet Academy of Sciences conference continued on January 31st.

    以斯大林著作和联共代表大会决议为基础
    苏科学院讨论提高科学研究工作
    【新华社一日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联科学院一月三十日在莫斯科科学工作者中央俱乐部举行大会，讨论以斯大林的著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”和苏联共产党第十九次代表大会的决议为基础提高科学研究工作的各种措施。到会的有苏联科学界著名的代表、各研究所和各实验室的负责人以及高等教育机关的代表。
    大会由苏联科学院副院长伊凡·普·巴尔金主持开幕。
    苏联科学院院长亚历山大·纳·涅斯米扬诺夫在会上作了报告，他就苏联共产党第十九次代表大会的决议论述了苏联科学院的任务。他说：“为了完成苏联共产党第十九次代表大会为新五年计划时期所规定的伟大任务，需要科学界所有部门的工作者都十分积极地参加工作。在苏联，科学起着它在整个人类历史上从未有过的作用。涅斯米扬诺夫指出：苏联科学家的志向是：为利用苏联的天然财富，为改进工业企业的地理分布状况，为全面研究和开发新的广大地区，为正在建设共产主义的苏联人民的利益改造自然而努力。
    涅斯米扬诺夫说：对于与开辟科学进一步发展的新远景有关的各种基本问题，将予以特别注意。在化学、物理化学、物理学和其他科学最新成就的基础上，将以更大的规模来进行关于有用矿藏分布状况的规律的研究。在与地球的起源、进化、结构和放射性有关的宇宙进化和地质上的基本问题，将在研究工作中占特殊重要的地位。为了执行苏联共产党第十九次代表大会规定的关于发展采煤工业的任务，就必须研究在地层深处采煤的理论和在露天矿场上的工作技术。为了设计效能十分强大的高速机器，科学家必须采用绝对新的计算方法、采用决定机器张力、变形和震动的新方法，和钻研关于最重要的生产过程，如金属切削、压力加工等的理论。在动力工程各主要部门，苏联科学家将集中力量进一步研究在苏联建立高压系统的问题。关于生物学理论方面，最重要的是：关于新陈代谢法则的研究和关于蛋白质的生物合成的过程的研究以及酵素的形成和非细胞形和细胞形有生物质的起源的研究。涅斯米扬诺夫在谈到社会科学的成就时指出：苏联历史学提出了并研究了许多新问题，这些问题只有在马克思列宁主义的社会发展学说的基础上才能求得解决。研究劳动群众的革命运动史是苏联历史学方面的巨大成就之一。今后，研究民主世界市场的发展和社会主义和民主阵营各国之间的经济合作是苏联经济学家的任务之一。苏联语言学家必须按照斯大林的著作“马克思主义在语言学中的问题”所提出的方针，来解决许多最重要的理论问题。
    涅斯米扬诺夫最后说：苏联科学家将不遗余力地实现共产党和苏维埃人民的期望。苏联科学必能完成它的历史任务并且将站上世界科学的第一位。
    大会接着开始讨论涅斯米扬诺夫报告中所提出的各项问题。
    苏联科学院大会一月三十一日再继续开会。
