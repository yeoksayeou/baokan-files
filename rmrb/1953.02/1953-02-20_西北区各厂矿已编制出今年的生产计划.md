Northwest Region Factories and Mines Have Prepared This Year's Production Plans

State-owned, locally state-owned, and jointly state-private factories and mines in the Northwest region have prepared their 1953 production plans. Due to the commissioning of some newly built enterprises, the number of production plan units comprehensively compiled by the former Northwest Military and Administrative Committee's Industry Department this year totals 178 (excluding 10 state-owned units), an increase of 126 compared to last year. During the process of preparing the plans this year, factories and mines universally mobilized the masses to participate and paid attention to tapping potential. Most large-scale factories and mines had preliminary experience in preparing plans for 1952 and had also rectified their original records. Generally, they were able to meet or exceed the state's target indicators, greatly improving various production quotas. The planned total value of production in the entire region this year is 79 percent higher than last year, and the quality of various products will also be improved compared to previous years. Many units have also prepared labor plans and cost plans, and some have also formulated technical organizational measures plans. According to the average calculation of the plans of 69 units, labor productivity will increase by more than 59 percent. The costs listed in the plans of 124 units are, on average, 7.39 percent lower than the estimated costs of last year.

In order to prepare this year's production plans well, the units began preparation work as early as August last year. In early November, with the participation and guidance of the former Northwest Military and Administrative Committee's Financial and Economic Committee, the former Northwest Military and Administrative Committee's Industry Department formally established a Planning Committee to centrally lead this work, and sent 12 working groups to go deep into various departments, bureaus, and key factories and mines to assist in the work. Each province also organized planning committees and working groups to go down to the factories. Most enterprises have summarized the implementation of the 1952 plan, discovered and solved some problems, and proposed advanced quotas as the basis for preparing the plan. The Yumen Oil Mine also conducted a relatively comprehensive and in-depth mass equipment inventory work, discovered potential forces, and provided reliable data for preparing the plan. All units universally studied the plan forms. Before preparing the plan, the Qinghai Provincial Department of Industry gathered more than 100 relevant cadres, studied for a week, researched and summarized past situations, and also conducted a trial compilation, so that everyone grasped the basic spirit of plan preparation. Those units that have done these preparatory work well, such as the Yumen Oil Mine and the Northwest Fourth State-owned Cotton Textile Factory, have prepared this year's plans faster and better; units that were not well prepared experienced rework and other phenomena.

The preparation of this year's plan, except for small enterprises under the special commissioner's office, generally adopted the method of formulating through mass discussion. The masses put forward many opinions and rationalization proposals in the discussion, and the leadership revised the plan according to the opinions of the masses, ensuring the advanced and practical nature of the plan, and enabling enterprise leaders and all employees to further understand plan management, and correcting the conservative thinking of some management personnel and technical personnel. For example, the Yumen Oil Mine first proposed a draft plan by the business department, the bureau chief made a mobilization report, and then cadres from the planning and design departments reported the main indicators in the draft plan to each unit, mobilized technicians and workers to discuss the parts and specific problems they were familiar with, and put forward measures to ensure the realization of the plan. The welfare plan for this year was discussed in the form of a meeting of representatives of workers' families, which educated workers and their families and increased their enthusiasm. Because the masses were truly mobilized in the discussion, the results were also greater. For example, the production plan draft proposed by the business department was lower than the production target stipulated by the higher level, but it exceeded it after discussion by the masses.

In the process of preparing the plan, many units handed the plan to the masses for discussion, but the effect was not great due to the lack of specific leadership and insufficient political and ideological education. For example, when the Ningxia Porcelain Factory discussed the plan, some workers proposed advanced quotas, but because the ideological mobilization work was not done enough, it was opposed by some people with conservative ideas, and the plan was still conservative. There were also a few factory and mine leaders who were unwilling to hand the plan to the masses for discussion at all. Some people think that "it is not easy to mobilize the masses, why do so many people need to discuss it?" Some people think that "workers do not understand the plan at all." For example, the cadre in charge of preparing the plan at the Yinchuan Power Plant believed that the old workers did not understand the performance of the new machines, and were unwilling to hand the plan to the workers for discussion.

In order to ensure the completion of this year's production plan, the former Northwest Military and Administrative Committee's Financial and Economic Committee put forward the following measures when compiling the plan: 1. Implement the economic accounting system through the production plan. Once the plan is approved, each enterprise must mobilize all employees to fight for the completion of the production plan. 2. Establish and improve the planning organization of each enterprise, organize original records, and strengthen statistical work. 3. Strengthen technical organizational measures, promote advanced experience, and plan to promote the advanced methods of the Yumen Oil Mine - implement monthly plans, deepen the planning work into workshops and groups, and carry out production according to the instruction charts. 4. Strengthen the inspection work in the process of implementing the plan and implement a system of regular inspections.

### 西北区各厂矿已编制出今年的生产计划

    西北区各厂矿已编制出今年的生产计划
    西北国营、地方国营及公私合营厂矿，已编出一九五三年生产计划。由于一些新建企业已投入生产，今年经原西北军政委员会工业部综合的生产计划单位共有一百七十八个（尚有十个国营单位未包括在内），比去年增加一百二十六个。在今年编制计划的过程中，各厂矿普遍发动群众参加，注意发掘潜力；大部分大型厂矿有了一九五二年编制计划的初步经验，又整顿了原始记录，一般地都能够达到和超过国家的任务指标，大大提高了各种生产定额。全区今年计划生产总值比去年增加百分之七十九，各种产品质量也将比往年提高。很多单位同时编了劳动计划和成本计划，有的还制订了技术组织措施计划。根据六十九个单位的计划平均计算，劳动生产率提高百分之五十九以上；一百二十四个单位的计划中所列的成本，平均比去年的预计成本降低百分之七点三九。
    为了编好今年的生产计划，各单位自去年八月份就开始了准备工作。十一月初，在原西北军政委员会财政经济委员会参加和指导下，原西北军政委员会工业部正式成立了编制计划委员会，统一领导这个工作，并派出十二个工作组，深入各厅、局及重点厂矿协助工作；各省也组织了编制计划委员会及下厂工作组。各企业单位大都对一九五二年计划执行情况进行了总结，发现和解决了一些问题，提出先进的定额，作为编制计划的依据。玉门油矿还比较全面地、深入地开展了一次群众性的设备查定工作，发现了潜在力量，为编制计划提供了可靠资料。各单位普遍学习了一次计划表格。青海省工业厅在编制计划之前，把有关干部一百多人集中起来，学习了一周，研究总结了过去的情况，还进行过一次试编，使大家掌握了编制计划的基本精神。凡是做好了这些准备工作的单位，如玉门油矿、国营西北第四棉纺织厂，今年的计划都编制得较快较好；准备不好的单位，便发生了返工等现象。
    今年计划的编制，除专署所属小型企业外，一般都是采用了通过群众讨论的方式制订的。群众在讨论中提出了很多意见和合理化建议，领导方面根据群众意见修正了计划，保证了计划的先进、切实，并使企业领导和全体职工对计划管理有了进一步的认识，纠正了某些管理人员和技术人员中的保守思想。如玉门油矿先由业务部门提出计划草案，局长作了动员报告，再由计划、设计部门干部，分别到各单位报告计划草案中的主要指标，动员技术人员和工人一起讨论自己熟悉的部分和具体问题，并提出保证实现计划的措施。用开职工家属代表会的方式，讨论今年的福利计划，教育了职工和家属，提高了他们的积极性。由于讨论中真正发动了群众，成绩也较大。如业务部门提出的生产计划草案，比上级规定的生产指标低，经过群众讨论后都超过了。
    在编制计划中，有不少单位虽把计划交给群众讨论了，但由于领导不具体，政治思想教育不够，效果并不大。如宁夏瓷器厂讨论计划时，部分工人提出先进的定额，因为思想动员工作做得不够，遭到某些有保守思想的人的反对，所订计划仍然是保守的。还有少数厂矿领导干部根本不愿把计划交给群众讨论。有的认为“动员群众不容易，何必要很多人讨论呢？”有的认为“工人根本不懂计划”。如银川电厂负责编计划的干部就认为老工人对新机器性能摸不清楚，不愿把计划交给工人讨论。
    为保证完成今年的生产计划，原西北军政委员会财政经济委员会在汇编计划时特提出下列措施：一、通过生产计划贯彻经济核算制，在计划一经批准后，各企业就要动员全体职工为完成生产计划而奋斗。二、设立和健全各企业的计划工作组织机构，整理原始记录，加强统计工作。三、加强技术组织措施，推广先进经验，有计划地推广玉门油矿的先进方法——实行月度计划、把计划工作深入车间和小组、按指示图表进行生产等。四、加强执行计划过程中的检查工作，实行定期检查的制度。
