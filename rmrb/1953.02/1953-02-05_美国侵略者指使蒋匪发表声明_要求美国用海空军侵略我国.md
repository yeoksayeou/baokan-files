Xinhua News Agency, 4th. The Chinese people's mortal enemy, Chiang Kai-shek, immediately issued a shameless statement on the 3rd, openly requesting the United States to use its naval and air forces to invade our country, after Eisenhower publicly announced that he would continue to occupy our Taiwan and instigate and assist the Kuomintang bandit gang to harass the Chinese mainland.

In his statement, traitor Chiang Kai-shek obsequiously flattered Eisenhower's unreasonable behavior of interfering in China's internal affairs and invading Taiwan as "the most reasonable and bright move by the United States." Chiang Kai-shek stated that he would faithfully act as a tool for Eisenhower's policy of "using Asians to fight Asians." He solemnly declared and guaranteed to his master that he knew that the American aggressors were afraid of suffering Japan's fate in the Second World War if they used ground troops to invade the Chinese mainland, so he vowed never to ask his master to use "ground troops" to assist in "combat." In other words, he asked the United States to use its naval and air forces to assist him in slaughtering the Chinese people.

Chiang Kai-shek's statement was obviously issued at the instigation of the American aggressors. One day before the statement was issued, US Assistant Secretary of State Allison had given specific instructions to Gu Weijun, the Kuomintang bandit gang's ambassador to the United States. In fact, in this statement, the American aggressors openly stated their conspiracy through the mouth of their lackey Chiang Kai-shek, that is, they will use their naval and air forces to continue to prevent the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan and to carry out aggressive activities against the Chinese people. This conspiracy of the American aggressors, which endangers peace in the Far East and the world, should arouse the serious vigilance of peace-loving people all over the world.

### 美国侵略者指使蒋匪发表声明  要求美国用海空军侵略我国

    美国侵略者指使蒋匪发表声明
    要求美国用海空军侵略我国
    【新华社四日讯】在艾森豪威尔公开宣布要继续侵占我国台湾，并策动和协助国民党匪帮骚扰中国大陆以后，中国人民的死敌蒋介石匪首立刻在三日发表了一个无耻已极的声明，公开要求美国用海空军对我国进行侵略。
    卖国贼蒋介石在他的声明中，把艾森豪威尔干涉中国内政、侵略台湾的无理行为，奴颜婢膝地恭维为“美国最合理而光明之举措”。蒋介石表示他将要忠实地充当艾森豪威尔的“用亚洲人打亚洲人”政策的工具。他向他的主子“郑重声明与保证”，表示他深知美国侵略者害怕用地面军队来侵扰中国大陆就要遭受第二次世界大战中日本的命运，因此，他发誓决不要求他的主子用“地面部队”来协助“作战”。换句话说，他要求美国用海空军来协助他屠杀中国人民。
    蒋介石这个声明显然是美国侵略者授意发表的。在声明发表以前一天，美国国务院助理国务卿艾利逊曾经对国民党匪帮驻美大使顾维钧作了具体指示。实际上，美国侵略者在这个声明中通过走狗蒋介石的嘴，公然说出了它的阴谋，这就是它将要使用它的海空军继续阻止中国人民解放台湾，并对中国人民进行侵略活动。美国侵略者这一危害远东与世界和平的阴谋，应该引起全世界爱好和平人民的严重警惕。
