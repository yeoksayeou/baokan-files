    The Railway Art Troupe from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, currently visiting China, gave a performance at the Youth Palace at 2:00 PM on the 14th to express their appreciation for anti-U.S. and aid-Korea workers, wounded soldiers, and their families. Among the attendees were Liu Fengqi, a hero who had twice been awarded meritorious service in the war to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea; Li Jifu, the father of martyr Li Zhenqiang, who heroically sacrificed his life while repairing a bridge in Korea; Model Aid-Korea Family Member, Granny Wang; and more than six hundred others. Before the performance, Li Qingqiu, head of the visiting Railway Art Troupe and Vice Minister of the Railway Ministry of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, delivered a speech. After recounting the selfless and heroic deeds of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the aid-Korea railway workers, he emphasized that the Korean people had seen the high degree of internationalism of the people of New China under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the wise leader Chairman Mao Zedong from the noble actions of these anti-U.S. and aid-Korea fighters. He also pointed out that this unbreakable friendship and unity between the Chinese and Korean people has become a great force for defeating the American imperialist aggressors. Representatives of the anti-U.S. and aid-Korea workers and wounded soldiers who were being honored, including Aid-Korea Hero Liu Fengqi and returned wounded soldier Ding Daxin, delivered speeches in response, unanimously expressing their determination to maintain the spirit of hard work and struggle they had displayed while working on the Korean front, to continue carrying out patriotic production in their work posts, to better conduct railway transportation work to support the Korean people, and to be ready to return to the Korean front at any time. Subsequently, members of the visiting Railway Art Troupe presented flowers to representatives of the anti-U.S. and aid-Korea workers, wounded soldiers, and their families, and performed wonderful programs. During the intermission, Head of the Troupe Li Qingqiu offered cordial greetings to Li Jifu, the 63-year-old father of Li Zhenqiang, who heroically sacrificed his life while repairing a bridge in Korea, as well as Li Lie's young nephews Li Zhonggui and Li Zhongyou, and model family member Granny Wang. Other senior leaders of the visiting Railway Art Troupe also personally attended to entertain the anti-U.S. and aid-Korea workers, wounded soldiers, and their families with fruits, tea, and snacks. The visiting Railway Art Troupe also presented Kim Il-sung Marshal commemorative badges and photos to representatives of the aid-Korea workers, wounded soldiers, and their families.
