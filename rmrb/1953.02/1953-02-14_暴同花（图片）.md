    Violent Tonghua
    Painting by Qi Ren, Edited by Xiang Yi
    (Adapted from Lin Gang's "A Peasant Family's Tragicomedy")
    Twenty-five, The couple lived together for another year, and they became more and more harmonious. They divided the work in the fields and at home; during the autumn wheat and summer harvest seasons, both men and women worked in the fields together; when threshing and rolling, the man led the work, and the woman helped. Guan Yin had also started school.
    Twenty-six, The man did most of the work in the fields, so Violent Tonghua had more time to spin and weave. The whole family had new cotton clothes for winter and single-layered clothes for summer.
    Twenty-seven, Now, Zhang Tongting is really good to his wife: If the woman wants to make shoes, the man will plant half a field of flax; if the woman is in a hurry to go to a meeting, the man will say, "I'll wash the pot." Zhang Tongting can read, and he also encourages Violent Tonghua to attend winter school.
    Twenty-eight, At this time, Violent Tonghua's mother-in-law suddenly fell ill, and she immediately volunteered to take care of her. The mother-in-law saw her daughter-in-law and understood everything. From then on, the relationship between the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law became completely good.
    Twenty-nine, The winter before last, when the central inspection team for inspecting the implementation of the Marriage Law came to Lushan, the district cadres and the township women's federation cadres helped Violent Tonghua and her family hold a family meeting. At the meeting, it was decided to unite the whole family and draw up a production plan harmoniously.
    Thirty, The Marriage Law turned a pair of enemy spouses into a good couple, and a broken feudal family into a harmonious and democratic family. Violent Tonghua gave birth to Guan Yin thirteen years ago, and last year she gave birth to a chubby baby. (The End)

    暴同花
    齐仁画　湘一编
    （根据林钢所作“一个农家的悲喜剧”改编）
    二十五、两口子又在一起过了一年多，越过越和美。地里家里，分工合作；秋麦两季，男女一齐下地；扬场放滚，男的领着做，女的搭把子。官印也早已上学了。
    二十六、地里的活大多由男的做了，暴同花就省出时间来多纺花、织布。一家子冬天棉的，夏天单的，样样都换上新的了。
    二十七、现在，张同廷对老婆可真好：女的要做鞋，男的就种了半分地麻，女的急着去开会，男的就说：“我来涮锅。”张同廷自己识字，也动员暴同花上冬学。
    二十八、这时候，忽然暴同花的婆婆病了，她马上自动去侍候。婆婆看到了媳妇，也明白过来了。从此，婆媳关系也就完全好起来。
    二十九、前年冬天，检查婚姻法执行情况的中央检查组到鲁山的时候，区干部与乡妇联干部帮助暴同花他们开了个家庭会议。会上，决定把全家合在一起，而且和和气气地订出了一个生产计划。
    三十、婚姻法使一对冤家夫妻变成了一对好夫妻，使一个破碎了的封建家庭变成了和睦的民主家庭。暴同花十三年前生了官印，去年又生了个胖娃娃。　（完）
