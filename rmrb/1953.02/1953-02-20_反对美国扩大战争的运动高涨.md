Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 19th: The General Secretary of the Indian Communist Party, Ajoy Ghosh, issued a statement calling on the Indian people to hold demonstrations to warn the American aggressors.

The statement said: "The American rulers, at the instigation of their running dog, the Kuomintang fascist bandits, are actively provoking the people's China. This action has been condemned by the world and opposed by their own partners. Under the heroic resistance of the Korean people and the Chinese People's Volunteers, these warmongering fellows are desperately trying to spread the flames of war to new regions of Asia, using Asians to fight Asians. They are threatening with blockades, forcing all countries to sever trade relations with China."

The statement emphasized: "In order to deal with the new war threat, the Indian Communist Party calls on the Indian people to unite. The Indian government must immediately and firmly demand an immediate ceasefire in Korea and warn the United States not to interfere in China. We urge all parties to unanimously raise these two demands in the grand gatherings and marches held in the Parliament and across the country. This is a matter of concern for all strata of people in our country. Let the whole country be mobilized on a large scale to oppose war on Asian soil."

The All-India Peace Council designates the 27th as "Stop Eisenhower Action Day"

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 19th: The Standing Committee of the All-India Peace Council held a meeting in New Delhi on the 14th and 15th. At the meeting, a letter to the Indian people was adopted, demanding that the Indian people and the Indian government oppose President Eisenhower's attempt to expand the Korean War, and demanding an immediate ceasefire in Korea, with the five major powers holding negotiations to discuss the issue of concluding a peace treaty.

On the 16th, the members of the Standing Committee met with the Deputy Speaker of the Indian People's Assembly, handed over the letter to the Indian people to the Indian Parliament, and expressed their hope to meet with the members of Congress separately soon to ask them to support the letter to the Indian people.

The Standing Committee decided to declare February 27th as the day for the people of India to protest against the American aggressive policy that endangers peace in Asia and the world, and suggested calling this day "Stop Eisenhower Action Day".

The Standing Committee supported the resolutions passed by the Vienna World People's Peace Congress and called on people from all walks of life in India to organize special peace conferences in the next three months. A national conference will be held at the end of May to discuss issues such as peace, the Indian economy and living standards.

The Standing Committee also issued an appeal to members of the Indian Parliament, provincial (state) assembly members, and religious leaders, asking them to participate in the peace movement.

Sunderlal condemns Eisenhower's clamor to use Chiang Kai-shek bandits to harass mainland China

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 19th: Indian newspapers recently published a statement by Sunderlal, the former head of the Indian Goodwill Delegation to China and a well-known peace fighter. The statement condemned U.S. President Eisenhower's announcement of using the Kuomintang remnant bandit gang to harass mainland China. In the statement, Sunderlal said: If Eisenhower's statement about Taiwan is just empty threats, then people may have nothing else to say, except that this statement is undignified and does not match the identity of the head of a great power. But if the United States really uses Chiang Kai-shek as a guise to invade new China, then this action will become one of the most despicable crimes committed by one country against another in history. If the American people are forced to participate in this action, then this will become the biggest stain on the United States. If the United Nations participates in this action, it will immediately lose the respect of the people of the world as soon as it does such a degenerate thing.

The statement emphasized: Any man or woman, as long as he or she has any concern for national freedom, social justice, or the dignity of human life, no matter what his or her nationality, belief, and race are, will inevitably look at this new expression of the President of the United States with horror and contempt.

In the event of such a thing happening, every freedom-loving person in the world has a sacred responsibility to give all possible spiritual and material assistance to the great Chinese people and their government who have been invaded.

Chairman of the American Labor Party of New York State and the National Labor Peace Conference condemn Eisenhower for violating his campaign promises

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 19th: The New York "Daily Worker" reported: Former U.S. Congressman and Chairman of the American Labor Party of New York State, Vito Marcantonio, accused Eisenhower in a television broadcast in New York on the 12th of not only violating his promise to end the Korean War as soon as possible during his campaign, but also letting the Chiang Kai-shek remnant bandit gang attack mainland China, which can only expand the war. Marcantonio pointed out that all the problems of the Korean War, except for the issue of exchanging prisoners of war, have been resolved. He urged an agreement on this issue. Marcantonio also commented on Eisenhower's plan to blockade China, saying that even if thousands more ships were added outside the Seventh Fleet, it would not cause significant damage to China. He said: "This fruitless blockade only means fighting with China," that is to say, the United States will fight with 475 million Chinese people, and 300 million Indian people oppose this action, and Europe also has great fear of this possibility.

The National Labor Peace Conference in New York also wrote to Eisenhower to oppose his decision on Taiwan. The letter said: "We express our opinions on behalf of millions of workers in the CIO, AFL, and independent trade unions... We are terrified to see the threat of using atomic weapons; the threat of blockading China; and the threat of using Asians to fight Asians. The brutal weapons of mass slaughter, the contempt for the lives of colored people, and further trade blockades are not tools of peace, but tools of war...

"The whole world knows that you were elected because you promised to end the Korean War quickly. There is only one way to end the Korean War: a ceasefire! Resume negotiations!"

British working class's protest movement against the U.S. expansion of the war in Korea expands

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 19th: According to the London "Daily Worker" on the 10th and 11th: Scottish miners participated in the British working class's protest movement against the U.S. policy of expanding the war to mainland China. This protest action, which is composed of various sectors of the working class, is continuing to expand. The Executive Committee of the National Union of Mineworkers (Scottish District) pointed out that Eisenhower's announced new act of aggression of using the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang in Taiwan to attack mainland China is "a threat to the British people and all peace-loving people in all countries." The Executive Committee demanded an immediate ceasefire in Korea and the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea.

New developments in the Scottish workers' "No War" movement also include: 200 miners from the Wales Greede Mine held a conference on the mine to protest Eisenhower's policies; 65 workers from the John Brown's Clyde Shipyard signed a declaration protesting Eisenhower's policies; machine workers, carpenters, cooperative organizations, and shop assistants also made protests.

In Sheffield and Rotherham, the Labor Party and trade union groups have passed 30 resolutions demanding an immediate ceasefire in Korea.

Various women's groups, including many branches of the Women's Cooperative Guild, telegraphed Churchill and local members of Parliament, asking the British government to tell the United States that Britain not only hopes to avoid taking actions that could cause further conflict but also hopes to find ways to end the Korean War as soon as possible.

James Endicott suggests declaring the 28th as Canada's day for striving for a truce in Korea

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 19th: The Canadian "Tribune" reported on the 9th: Dr. James Endicott, chairman of the Canadian Peace Congress, suggested stepping up the campaign to end the Korean War in Canada. It also suggested declaring February 28 as the National Day for Striving for a Truce in Korea. He called on the Canadian people to force the Canadian government to express its hope for an immediate truce at the United Nations.

When announcing his suggestion, he said: "On this day, those who actively participate in the cause of peace should deliver 'immediate ceasefire' letters to millions of families, asking people to visit, call, or write to their parliamentarians, and let them speak out loudly, demanding practical ways to end the Korean War."

According to the Canadian Peace Congress newspaper "Peace News," Endicott's suggestion has gained widespread support among the Canadian people. Citizens in several constituencies are trying to meet with members of Parliament in order to discuss the suggestion of a truce in Korea with them.

Millions of postcards requesting the Premier of Saskatchewan to propose an immediate truce proposal have been sent to residents of Saskatchewan.

Mrs. Eva Sanderson, Vice-Chairman of the Canadian Peace Congress, demanded in a telegram to Premier St. Laurent that the Canadian government propose a suggestion for a truce in Korea, and demanded that the remaining issues be resolved through negotiations.

    反对美国扩大战争的运动高涨
    印共总书记高士号召印度人民举行示威警告美国侵略者
    【新华社新德里十九日电】印度共产党总书记高士发表声明，号召在印度全国各地进行反对美国扩大远东侵略战争的运动。
    声明说：“美国统治者指使他们的走狗国民党法西斯匪徒积极向人民中国挑衅，这种行动已受到全世界的斥责和他们自己的伙伴的反对。在朝鲜人民和中国人民志愿军的英勇抵抗下，这些好战成性的家伙拚命想使战火蔓延到亚洲新的地区，用亚洲人打亚洲人。他们以封锁相威胁，逼迫一切国家与中国断绝贸易关系。”
    声明强调说：“为了对付新的战争威胁，印度共产党号召印度人民团结起来。印度政府必须即刻坚决要求立即在朝鲜停火，并警告美国不要干涉中国。我们吁请各党派在国会中以及在全国各地举行的盛大集会和游行中一致提出这两个要求。这是对我国各阶层人民都有关系的事情，让全国大规模地动员起来，反对在亚洲土地上进行战争。”
    全印和平理事会定二十七日为“制止艾森豪威尔行动日”
    【新华社新德里十九日电】全印和平理事会常务委员会于十四日和十五日在新德里举行会议。会上通过告印度人民书，要求印度人民和印度政府反对美国总统艾森豪威尔扩大朝鲜战争的企图，并要求立即在朝鲜停战，五大国举行谈判，讨论缔结和平公约问题。
    常务委员会的委员们在十六日会见了印度人民院副议长，把告印度人民书交给印度国会，并表示希望不久之后能分别会见国会议员，要求他们支持告印度人民书。
    常务委员会决定宣布二月二十七日为印度各地人民抗议危害亚洲和世界和平的美国侵略政策的日子，并建议称这一天为“制止艾森豪威尔行动日”。
    常务委员会拥护维也纳世界人民和平大会通过的决议，并且号召印度各阶层人民在今后三个月中组织特别的和平会议。五月底将举行全国会议，讨论关于和平、印度经济和生活水平等问题。
    常务委员会还对印度国会议员、省（邦）议会议员和宗教领袖们发出呼吁书，要求他们参加和平运动。
    森德拉尔斥责艾森豪威尔叫嚣用蒋匪侵扰中国大陆
    【新华社新德里十九日电】印度各报最近刊载了前印度亲善访华团团长、著名的和平战士森德拉尔发表的声明。声明斥责美国总统艾森豪威尔宣布利用国民党残余匪帮侵扰中国大陆的行动。森德拉尔在声明中说：如果艾森豪威尔关于台湾的声明只是虚声恫吓，那么人们也许没有什么别的话可说，只能说这种声明是没有尊严的，是和一个大国元首的身份不相称的。但是如果美国真的用蒋介石做幌子来侵犯新中国，那么这种行动将会成为历史上一国对另一国所犯的最卑劣的罪行之一。如果美国人民被迫参加这种行动，那么这将成为美国的最大污点。如果联合国参与这种行动，那么在它刚一干这种堕落的事情的时候，它将立即失去全世界人民的尊重。
    声明强调说：任何一个男子或妇女，只要对民族自由、社会正义或人命的尊严有任何关怀，不管他或她的国籍、信仰和种族有什么不同，都必然会抱着惊骇和鄙视的态度来看待美国总统的这种新的表示。
    万一发生这样的事情，全世界每一个爱好自由的人都负有神圣的责任，给遭受侵犯的伟大的中国人民和他们的政府以一切可能的精神上和物质上的援助。
    纽约州美劳工党主席和全国劳工和平会议谴责艾森豪威尔违反竞选时的诺言
    【新华社布拉格十九日电】纽约“工人日报”报道：前美国国会议员、纽约州美国劳工党主席维托·马肯托尼奥十二日在纽约的电视广播中指责艾森豪威尔不仅违反了他在竞选时所作的要使朝鲜战争早日结束的诺言，而且让蒋介石残余匪帮进攻中国大陆，这只能是扩大战争。马肯托尼奥指出朝鲜战争的一切问题，除了交换战俘问题以外都已得到了解决。他敦促在这个问题上取得协议。马肯托尼奥也评论了艾森豪威尔要封锁中国的计划，他说，即使在第七舰队以外再增调几千艘舰只，对中国也造成不了重大的损害。他说：“这种毫无结果的封锁只是意味着和中国作战”，这就是说，美国将和四亿七千五百万的中国人民作战，此外还有三亿印度人民反对这种行动，欧洲对这个可能性也怀着极大的恐惧。
    纽约的全国劳工和平会议也写信给艾森豪威尔，反对他关于台湾的决定。这封信说：“我们代表产联、劳联和独立的工会的千百万工人来发表意见……我们怀着恐惧的心理看到使用原子武器的威胁；封锁中国的威胁；和用亚洲人打亚洲人的威胁。大规模屠杀的残酷武器、对有色人种的生命的轻视以及进一步的贸易封锁，都不是和平的工具，而是战争的工具……
    “全世界都知道，你是由于允诺迅速结束朝鲜战争而当选的。结束朝鲜战争只有一个办法：停火！恢复谈判！”
    英国工人阶级反对美国扩大侵朝战争的抗议运动扩大
    【新华社布拉格十九日电】据伦敦“工人日报”十日和十一日消息：苏格兰矿工参加了英国工人阶级对美国扩大战争到中国大陆的政策的抗议运动，这个由工人阶级的各个部门所组成的抗议行动正在继续扩大。全国矿工联盟（苏格兰区）执行委员会指艾森豪威尔宣布的利用台湾蒋介石匪帮进攻中国大陆的新的侵略行为是“对英国人民以及一切国家爱好和平人民的一个威胁”。执行委员会要求立即在朝鲜停火，并从朝鲜撤退一切外国军队。
    苏格兰工人“不要战争”运动的新发展还有：威尔斯·格里德二百矿工在矿井上举行了一个抗议艾森豪威尔政策的大会；约翰·布朗斯·克莱德造船厂六十五名工人签署了抗议艾森豪威尔政策的宣言；机器工人、木工、合作社组织和店员也都纷纷提出抗议。
    在设菲尔德和罗塞翰的工党与工会团体已经通过了三十件决议，要求立即在朝鲜停火。
    各种妇女团体，包括妇女合作社公会的许多分会在内，致电邱吉尔和当地的议员们，要求英国政府告诉美国，英国不但希望避免采取足以引起进一步的冲突的行动而且希望觅致尽速结束朝鲜战争的办法。
    文幼章建议宣布二十八日为加拿大争取朝鲜停战日
    【新华社布拉格十九日电】加拿大“论坛报”九日报道：加拿大和平大会主席文幼章博士建议在加拿大加紧进行要求结束朝鲜战争的运动。并建议宣布二月二十八日为全国争取朝鲜停战日。他号召加拿大人民迫使加拿大政府在联合国表示希望立刻停战的态度。
    他在宣布他的建议时说：“在这一天，那些积极参加和平事业的人应该向千万个家庭递送‘立刻停火’的信件，要求人民访问、打电话或是写信给他们的议员，让他们大声疾呼，要求以实际可行的办法来结束朝鲜战争。”
    据加拿大和平大会的报纸“和平新闻”报道，文幼章的建议在加拿大人民中间获得广大的支持。几个选区的公民们正在设法会见议会议员，以便和他们讨论朝鲜停战的建议。
