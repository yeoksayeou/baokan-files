The Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government Accepts This Newspaper's Criticism; Punishes Responsible Personnel of the Temporary Construction Department for Indiscriminately Recruiting Workers

Following this newspaper's criticism on January 8th and 21st of the Temporary Construction Department of the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government for indiscriminately recruiting construction workers by means of increasing welfare benefits, and refusing to obey government handling, the Ministry of Railways has conducted an investigation into the matter. The Ministry believes that the facts stated in the newspaper are consistent with reality and has decided to give a warning to Wang Taifeng, the head of the Temporary Construction Department, and to criticize Guo Weixi, the head of the personnel section of the Temporary Construction Department. They are also instructed to make a public self-criticism among the department's employees and to send all the improperly recruited employees back to their original units. The Temporary Construction Department of the Ministry of Railways also submitted a letter to this newspaper making a self-criticism, admitting the mistake of indiscriminately recruiting workers and disobeying government handling, pointing out that this mistake was caused by "a purely task-oriented viewpoint, only caring about completing one's own task, and ignoring the overall interests of the state, resulting in departmentalism." It also expressed acceptance of the newspaper's criticism, guaranteed to send all the recruited workers back, and resolved not to repeat the mistake of departmentalism.

    中央人民政府铁道部接受本报批评
    处分乱拉工人的临时建筑处负责人员
    本报一月八日、二十一日批评了中央人民政府铁道部临时建筑处以提高福利待遇等手段乱拉建筑工人，拒不服从政府的处理后，铁道部已就此事作了检查。该部认为报纸所载符合事实，决定给临时建筑处处长王抬风以警告处分，给临时建筑处人事科科长郭维希以批评，并责成他们在该处员工中公开检讨，将所有抢拉的员工全部送回原单位。铁道部临时建筑处也投函本报作了检讨，检讨中承认乱拉工人和不服从政府处理的错误，指出这一错误是由于“单纯任务观点，只顾自己完成任务，不顾国家整体利益的本位主义所造成”，并表示接受报纸的批评，保证把拉来的工人全部送回，决不再犯本位主义的错误。
