Editor's Note: The Fojia Village incident published here illustrates the serious bureaucratic work style of some local leading organs, which gave bad elements who commit evil deeds an opportunity to exploit. These bad elements have infiltrated district and township governments and Party organizations, and their arbitrary harm to the people has reached its peak. If these bad elements and bureaucratic work style are not immediately eliminated with effective measures, the harm to the Party and the people will be unimaginable. We urge the Liaoning Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Government to immediately send personnel to inspect the work of Andong County and investigate those responsible for this case. In addition to the bad elements being punished by law, personnel who have committed bureaucratic errors must also be subject to administrative and Party disciplinary actions.

In 1949, a theft case occurred at the cooperative in Fujia Village, Changshan District, Andong County, Liaoning Province. Because county and district cadres shielded the bad elements in this case and severely suppressed and attacked the masses who exposed it, the masses in the village had long distrusted the policies of the Party and the People's Government, causing extremely bad effects.

The Fujia Village cooperative (now the supply and marketing cooperative) theft occurred on the night of April 28, 1949. That night, the people living in the cooperative were Dan Xisheng, the district organization committee member (then of Dongjianshan District; due to the small number of cadres, the district had no district party secretary, and Dan Xisheng was actually responsible for leading the entire district), and Song Hongbin, the cooperative manager. During the night, when Dan Xisheng went out to urinate, he found that the door was not bolted. He asked Song Hongbin why he had not bolted the door before going to bed. Song Hongbin replied that he had bolted it before going to bed, and there might be a thief, so he got up and looked around with a lamp. When he shone the light on the counter, he found Ni Zili (a Party member), the deputy village chief of the village, squatting there, acting suspiciously. Song Hongbin immediately shouted that there was a thief. Dan Xisheng fired a shot, and Ni Zili immediately rushed out the door and fled. Song Hongbin told Dan Xisheng that the person was Ni Zili, but Dan Xisheng told him to "keep it a secret" and not spread it around. The next day, Dan Xisheng announced to the masses that because it was dark, the thief was not caught, and nothing was lost from the cooperative, so let it be. After Dan Xisheng left, the cooperative staff, in order to clarify responsibility, unanimously demanded that Song Hongbin explain the truth, and Song Hongbin had no choice but to tell the truth. At that time, under the chairmanship of village chief Liu Zhongde (also chairman of the cooperative's board of directors), a complaint was filed with the district government.

Soon, district chief Wang Ji'en came to Fujia Village with people to investigate and convened a mass meeting. At the meeting, Song Hongbin and others testified that the thief was Ni Zili. At first, Wang Ji'en defended Ni Zili. Later, because the masses unanimously confirmed it, Wang Ji'en took Ni Zili and Song Hongbin back to the district government. But as soon as they arrived at the district government, Ni Zili was immediately released, while Song Hongbin was detained. Wang Ji'en personally conducted the trial of Song Hongbin, forcing him to admit that he committed the theft himself and that he had falsely accused Ni Zili. When the interrogation yielded no results, he sent Song Hongbin to the county people's court. Qu Jingtang, the cooperative accountant in Fujia Village, and others were very upset when they heard the news and wanted to file a complaint with the county leadership. When Dan Xisheng and Wang Ji'en heard about this, they arrested Qu Jingtang, Nan Yuanshan (cooperative buyer), and others one after another, tortured them, and forced them to admit that they had "conspired to steal" with Song Hongbin. Qu Jingtang and Nan Yuanshan could not bear the torture and had to admit it. Then, Dan Xisheng and Wang Ji'en rushed to Fujia Village, convened a mass meeting, announced that Song Hongbin was a "conspirator to steal," and tied up Qu Jingtang and Nan Yuanshan to be exposed to the sun. Then they sent them to the county court for sentencing. The masses in Fujia Village were even more dissatisfied. Soon, some people wanted to jointly guarantee Song Hongbin, Qu Jingtang, and others and accused the district government of wrong handling. So Wang Ji'en returned to Fujia Village and convened a mass meeting, saying that Song Hongbin and others had confessed to "conspiring to steal," and arrested more than a dozen people who insisted that Ni Zili was the real thief and subjected them to collective punishment: kneeling on broken bowls, sun exposure, head bumping, imitating wolf howls, grabbing pig feces, and eating soil and coal slag. The opinions of the masses were thus suppressed.

When the Andong County People's Court adjudicated this case, it did not summon Ni Zili, whom the masses had accused, but allowed Wang Ji'en to appear in court to coerce Song Hongbin and others to plead guilty. Nan Yuanshan admitted his original confession because he was afraid of being tortured, but Song Hongbin firmly refused to admit it, and Qu Jingtang also recanted, stating that his original confession was forced under torture. The court did not ask the reason and determined that Song Hongbin was the "principal offender" and sentenced him to two years in prison; Qu Jingtang was sentenced to one and a half years in prison; and Nan Yuanshan was sentenced to six months in prison. Although Li, the president of the court who handled the case at the time, knew that district cadres Dan Xisheng and Wang Ji'en had engaged in forced confessions, he still believed their reports.

What kind of person is Ni Zili? Why did the district cadres repeatedly shield him? According to a recent investigation by the Changshan District Committee during Party rectification, Ni Zili is a habitual thief. Ni Zili's background is unclear. He originally lived in another village and had been struggled against by the masses. He had stolen corn, large vats, and other things. He moved to Fujia Village secretly at night. Recently, Ni Zili participated in Party rectification. When explaining his problems, he falsely claimed that he had mental illness and asked for leave to go home. But the masses said that he had no mental illness at all. Ni Zili was introduced to the Party by Dan Xisheng, and Ni Zili's nephew calls Dan Xisheng "godfather." Dan Xisheng and Ni Zili had engaged in common corruption. Dan Xisheng embezzled timber in Songjia Village and stored it in Ni Zili's home. Dan Xisheng not only often beat and scolded the masses in Fujia Village, but also forced the village chief to kneel in Linjia Village. The reason why Dan Xisheng dared to act recklessly was that, in addition to being the sole decision-maker in the district, Xu Guang, then the organization minister of the county party committee (now working in the Organization Department of the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee), blindly trusted him. Cadres and masses who had worked with Dan Xisheng had reported Dan Xisheng's illegal and undisciplined behavior to the county party committee, but Xu Guang believed that Dan Xisheng had fought guerrillas and had merit, and did not pay attention to the masses' reports, nor did he give Dan Xisheng the punishment he deserved. Wang Ji'en, who jointly punished the masses in Fujia Village with Dan Xisheng at the time, was also a person who suppressed the masses and violated laws and discipline. He later had illegal and undisciplined behavior in Fujia Village, Songjia Village, Xuancheng Village, and other places. He is now the director of the Jianhua Brick Factory in Andong County.

The erroneous handling of the Fujia Village theft case had extremely bad effects locally. Some Party members in the village openly violated laws and discipline as a result. For example, when the government dispatched laborers, Party member Ji Dianzhong openly resisted. When carrying out savings, livestock insurance, and other work, many Party members openly opposed it. The masses dared not question them, calling them "people in the Party" and "untouchable." According to the masses, Ji Guang'en, the village party secretary, is also very bad. He shields counter-revolutionaries, has confused relations with women, has robbed people with guns, and arbitrarily punishes Party members who are not in his favor. Theft cases in the village also occur constantly. Recently, the supply and marketing cooperative and the seedling nursery in the village were successively stolen. It has been determined that the theft of the supply and marketing cooperative was committed by Ni Zide, Ni Zili's brother. What is particularly serious is that after the theft of the cooperative, the masses were very suspicious of the policies of the Party and the People's Government. The mutual aid and cooperation movement in Fujia Village also cannot be carried out. County and district cadres do not study the reasons for this and blindly call Fujia Village a "backward village."

The fact that the Fujia Village case has not been properly handled for a long time shows that the leading cadres in Andong County have a serious bureaucratic work style. For example, when the county court handled the case, it not only believed the false reports and made a wrong judgment, but also, when the masses revealed that there were problems with the case during the judicial reform movement, it did not re-handle it. During the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the "Three-Anti" and Party rectification movements, the masses repeatedly raised the case, but the county and district cadres ignored it, and even attacked the whistleblowers. Wang Mingjia, the deputy director of the County People's Supervision Committee and the current secretary of the Changshan District Committee, and others had heard the masses reflect that the handling of the case was wrong, but they did not insist on principled struggle. More seriously, Cui Chengxin, the former secretary of the Changshan District Committee and the current deputy director of the Organization Department of the Andong County Party Committee, actually supported the bad village cadres in Fujia Village and suppressed the criticism of the masses. Last year, someone revealed the illegal and undisciplined behavior of Ji Guang'en, the party secretary of Fujia Village. Cui Chengxin not only did not seriously investigate and deal with it, but instead went to the village to convene a branch meeting (absorbing activists from the masses to participate) and announced that it was "bad people spreading rumors" and attacking upright village cadres, and suspended the party membership of the deputy village chief who insisted on criticizing Ji Guang'en.

At present, the Andong County Party Committee and the Changshan District Committee do not know the details of the case and have not re-handled it, but the County Party Committee has decided that the County Discipline Inspection Commission, the County Party Committee Organization Department, and the County People's Supervision Committee will form an inspection team to conduct investigations.

    辽东省安东县领导干部官僚主义作风严重
    听任坏区干部包庇盗贼残害人民
    编者按：这里公布的富家村的事件，说明一部分地方领导机关有严重的官僚主义作风，给了为非作恶的坏分子以可乘之隙；这些坏分子钻入区乡政权和党的组织，任意残害人民，已经达到登峰造极的地步。这些坏分子和官僚主义作风如不立即采取有效办法予以清除，党和人民所遭受的危害将是不堪设想的。我们要求辽东省委和省人民政府立即派员检查安东县的工作，追查该案的负责人员。除坏分子应受到法律制裁外，犯有官僚主义错误的人员也必须受到行政的和党的处分。
    辽东省安东县长山区富家村在一九四九年发生合作社被盗案，因县、区干部包庇这一案件中的坏分子，严重压制并打击揭发这一案件的群众，致使该村群众长期不信任党和人民政府的政策，造成极坏的影响。
    富家村合作社（即现在的供销社）被盗案发生在一九四九年四月二十八日夜。那夜住在合作社里的有该区组织委员单希圣（当时为东尖山区。因干部少，该区没有区委书记，单希圣实际负责领导全区）和合作社经理宋洪滨。夜间，单希圣出外小便时，发现屋门没上闩，便问宋洪滨为什么睡前没有上闩？宋洪滨回答说睡前已经闩好，可能有贼，便起来提着灯寻找。当照到栏柜时，发现本村副村长倪子礼（党员）蹲在那里，鬼鬼祟祟，宋洪滨即大喊有贼。单希圣打了一枪，倪子礼即夺门而逃。宋洪滨告诉单希圣说那人是倪子礼，单希圣却要他“保守秘密”，不要外传。第二天，单希圣向群众宣布，因为天黑，没抓到贼，合作社也没丢东西，就算罢了。单希圣离去后，合作社职员为弄清责任，一致要求宋洪滨说明真象，宋洪滨只得说了实情。当时在村长柳忠德（兼合作社理事会主席）主持下，向区政府提出控告。
    不久，区长王吉恩带着人来富家村作调查，并召集了群众大会。在大会上，宋洪滨等纷纷证明贼是倪子礼。开始时王吉恩为倪子礼辩护。后来因为群众一致证实，王吉恩便把倪子礼、宋洪滨带回区政府。但一到区政府，倪子礼便立即被释放了，宋洪滨却被押了起来。王吉恩亲自行刑审讯宋洪滨，逼他承认是自己作盗，是诬告倪子礼。审问没有结果，便把宋洪滨送到县人民法院。富家村合作社会计曲景堂等听到这个消息，十分不平，要向县领导机关提出控告。单希圣、王吉恩听到后，便先后把曲景堂、南元山（合作社采买员）等抓起来，进行拷打，并逼他们承认和宋洪滨“合谋偷盗”。曲景堂、南元山受刑不过，只得承认。接着，单希圣、王吉恩赶到富家村，召开群众大会，宣布宋洪滨是
    “合谋偷盗”，并把曲景堂、南元山二人绑吊起来晒太阳，随后送交县法院判刑。富家村群众对此更加不满，不久就有些群众要联名保宋洪滨、曲景堂等，并纷纷指责区政府的处理是错误的。于是王吉恩又回到富家村召开群众大会，说宋洪滨等已供认是“合谋偷盗”，并把坚持说倪子礼是真贼的十多名群众都抓起来，实行集体处罚：跪破碗、晒太阳、碰头、学狼叫、抓猪粪、吃土煤渣等。群众的意见就这样被压制下去了。
    安东县人民法院在判决此案时，根本没有传讯群众所控告的倪子礼，却准许王吉恩出庭威逼宋洪滨等认罪。南元山因怕受刑，承认原供；但宋洪滨则坚不承认，曲景堂也翻了供，并说明原供是受刑不过被迫承认的。法院不问情由，就确定宋洪滨为
    “主犯”，判处二年徒刑；判曲景堂一年半徒刑；判南元山六个月徒刑。当时处理此案的李院长虽然知道区干部单希圣、王吉恩有逼供行为，但仍相信他们的报告。
    倪子礼是什么样的人呢？为什么区干部一再包庇他呢？据最近长山区委在整党中的调查，倪子礼是个惯盗。倪子礼的成份不明，原住在外村，被群众斗争过，曾偷过玉米、大缸等。他到富家村是夜间偷着搬来的。最近倪子礼参加整党，在交代问题时，假称自己有疯病，请假回家。但群众说他根本没有疯病。倪子礼是单希圣介绍入党的，倪子礼的侄子叫单希圣“干爹”。单希圣与倪子礼曾有共同贪污的行为，单希圣在宋家村贪污了木材，就曾寄存在倪子礼的家里。单希圣不但在富家村经常打骂群众，在林家村也曾罚村长下跪。单希圣所以敢大胆妄为，除在区里是说一不二之外，还由于当时的县委组织部长徐光（现在中共中央东北局组织部工作）对他盲目信任。和单希圣一起工作过的干部及群众曾向县委检举过单希圣的违法乱纪行为，但徐光却认为单希圣打过游击，有功，既不重视群众的检举，也没有给单希圣以应有的处分。当时和单希圣共同处罚富家村群众的王吉恩，也是个压制群众、违法乱纪的分子。他以后又曾在富家村、宋家村、宣城村等地有过违法乱纪行为。他现在是安东县建华制砖厂的厂长。
    富家村偷盗案的错误处理，在当地发生了极坏的影响。该村有的党员因此而公开违法乱纪，如政府派民工时，党员季殿忠公开抗拒。开展储蓄、牲畜保险等工作时，不少党员公开反对。群众对他们不敢过问，称他们是“在党的”，“惹不起”。据群众反映，该村支部书记季广恩也很坏，包庇反革命分子，男女关系混乱，拿着枪抢过人，随便处分和自己不睦的党员。该村盗窃案也不断发生。最近该村供销合作社和苗圃相继被盗，供销合作社的被盗案已确定是倪子礼的哥哥倪子德干的。特别严重的，是合作社发生被盗案后，群众对党和人民政府的政策十分怀疑。富家村的互助合作运动也搞不起来。县、区干部不研究此中原因，盲目地称富家村是“落后村”。
    富家村一案长时期没有得到正确处理，说明安东县的领导干部有着严重的官僚主义作风。如县法院在处理此案时，不仅轻信假报告，做出错误判决，且在司法改革运动中，经群众揭发而发现此案有问题时，也没有作重新处理。在镇压反革命、“三反”和整党等运动中，群众曾再三提起此案，但县、区干部都置之不理，甚至打击检举人。该县人民监察委员会副主任和现任长山区区委书记王明甲等，都曾听到群众反映此案处理错误，但都没有坚持原则的斗争。更严重的是前任长山区区委书记、现任安东县委组织部副部长的崔成信，竟为富家村的坏村干部撑腰，压制群众的批评。去年曾有人揭发富家村支部书记季广恩的违法乱纪行为，崔成信不但不认真调查处理，反去该村召开支部大会（吸收群众积极分子参加），宣布是“坏人造谣”，打击正派的村干部等，并把坚持批评季广恩的副村长停止了党籍。
    目前，安东县委和长山区委还不知道这一案件的详情，也没有做重新处理，但县委已决定由县委纪律检查委员会、县委组织部及县人民监察委员会组成检查组前往进行调查。（于长钦、曹科）
