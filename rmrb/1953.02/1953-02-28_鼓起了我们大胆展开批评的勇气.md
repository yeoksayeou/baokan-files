Summoned the Courage to Boldly展開 Criticism
Anshan "Worker Life" Newspaper Editorial Board

After reading the article "Anshan 'Worker Life' Newspaper Encounters Serious Obstacles from Bureaucrats in Carrying out Criticism" published in the People's Daily on February 6th in the "Review of Newspaper Work," we unanimously agreed that the criticism of us was completely correct. As the article pointed out, we failed to resolutely implement the Party Central Committee's "Decision on Launching Criticism and Self-Criticism in Newspapers and Publications" and launch a resolute struggle against those bureaucraticists who resisted and suppressed criticism. Our failure to persist in the struggle for criticism was primarily manifested in the fact that, for many criticisms reflected by the masses, even if they were correct, we dared not independently and responsibly publish them in a timely manner, but often forwarded them to relevant departments for investigation and handling, or sought the consent of those being criticized. Consequently, some that could have been published were "forwarded" by us, and some letters that should have been investigated and handled by the editorial department were lightly let go. And for "forwarded" letters that did not receive a reply for a long time (such as those concerning the Municipal Department Store, the Court, and the Transportation Department of the Iron and Steel Company), we did not bother to follow up, as if fulfilling the responsibility of forwarding the letter was enough, and whether the reply was given or whether the reply was correct was not our responsibility. In this way, the problems that the people urgently needed to solve were locked in the drawers of the bureaucraticists, which damaged the enthusiasm of the people to criticize. Our newspaper is the spokesperson for the Party and the people (especially the workers and peasants). Our Party Central Committee has given newspapers the responsibility to handle criticisms reflecting the opinions of the masses "independently," that is, "as long as newspapers and publications confirm that such criticisms are basically correct, even if they have not sought or obtained the consent of those being criticized, they should still be responsible for publishing them." (CCP Central Committee "Decision on Launching Criticism and Self-Criticism in Newspapers and Publications") However, we failed to resolutely implement the decision of the Party Central Committee and adopted an attitude of not being independently responsible. More seriously, for correspondents like worker Cao Yongkui who suffered blows because of criticism, we did not bravely give public support, but passively transferred the materials back and forth. Even when the materials were lost, we did not pursue them, and the matter was dropped. The Party Central Committee's decision pointed out: "The activities of worker and peasant correspondents should be listed as one of the items for checking the work of newspapers and the Party's work in various production units. No one shall abuse power to suppress the criticisms of worker and peasant correspondents in newspapers and publications, or retaliate against them." However, we took a non-angry and passive attitude towards the arbitrary behavior of Ma Chengde and others who abused their power to retaliate against correspondents.

The above-mentioned attitude of ignoring the criticisms reflected by the masses and failing to actively protect correspondents from persecution not only shows that our Party spirit is not strong, our mass viewpoint is weak, and our bureaucracy is serious, but also shows that we lack the courage to conduct political struggle.

Why do we lack the courage to struggle? First of all, we considered our personal gains and losses too much, fearing that adhering to criticism would be met with blows or retaliation, and fearing that future work would be difficult. Secondly, it is related to our personal political and ideological level being too low, that is, the ideological leadership of the editorial department has also been very weak in recent years, which has resulted in a very weak atmosphere of political principles in the editorial department, and criticism and self-criticism have not been carried out well, and theoretical and policy study is even worse. This is the basic reason why our editorial department cannot boldly launch bottom-up criticism in the newspaper.

Of course, another major reason why we cannot launch criticism in the newspaper is related to the leadership of the Anshan Municipal Committee of the CCP. Han Tianshi, Secretary of the Municipal Committee, wrote to us twice to restrict the issue of launching criticism in the newspaper. The result of this restriction was that a negative mood generally grew in the editorial department, and the number of criticism articles in the newspaper also decreased significantly. Now, upon inspection, we should not have treated Comrade Han Tianshi's opinions with a negative mood. Because this negative mood not only prevented Comrade Han Tianshi's mistakes in dealing with newspaper criticism from being corrected for a long time, but also affected the healthier development of various tasks in Anshan. Although we raised our opinions at the Party Newspaper Committee on January 3 this year, requesting the Municipal Committee to discuss and check the work of the newspaper in the future, regularly convene the Party Newspaper Committee, review the reporting guidelines and plans, notify the newspaper to participate in some necessary meetings, etc.; more than a month has passed since the meeting, and the Municipal Committee's leadership over the newspaper has not yet seen significant improvements.

In the future, we should learn from past lessons. In addition to continuing to actively obtain the leadership of the Party Committee, the editorial department decided to start from strengthening theoretical and policy learning and investigation and research to improve the mass character and combat effectiveness of the newspaper. At present, the editorial department has combined inspection work to launch a study on criticism and self-criticism.

This is our preliminary review. Since we have damaged the interests of the Party and made a principled error in implementing the Party's decision, we are willing to accept the punishment given to us by the Party.

    鼓起了我们大胆展开批评的勇气
    鞍山“工人生活”报编委会
    我们读了二月六日人民日报“报纸工作述评”所刊“鞍山‘工人生活’报在开展批评中遭遇到官僚主义者的严重阻碍”一文后，一致认为其中对我们的批评是完全正确的。正如该文所指出的，我们没有坚决贯彻党中央“关于在报纸刊物上展开批评和自我批评的决定”，向那些抗拒批评、压制批评的官僚主义者展开坚决的斗争。我们不能坚持批评斗争首先表现在：对许多群众反映的批评意见，即使是正确的，我们也不敢独立负责地及时加以发表，而常常是转到有关部门调查处理，或者是征求被批评者的同意。因而，有些可以公开发表的被我们“照转”了，有些应由编辑部调查处理的来信被轻轻放过了；而对“照转”的来信，长期得不到答复
    （如市百货公司、法院、钢铁公司运输部等），我们也不再去追问，好像尽到了转信的责任就行，答复与否或答复的对不对，都不是我们的责任了。这样，就使人民群众迫切需要解决的问题，被关在官僚主义者的抽屉里，而损害了人民群众批评的积极性。我们的报纸是党和人民群众（特别是工农群众）的代言者，我党中央对反映群众意见的批评，已给予报纸以“独立”处理的责任，即“只要报纸刊物确认这种批评在基本上是正确的，即令并未征求或未征得被批评者的同意，仍然应当负责加以发表。”（中共中央“关于在报纸刊物上展开批评和自我批评的决定”）可是，我们却没有坚决贯彻党中央的决定，而采取了不独立负责的态度。更严重的是，对于因批评而遭受打击的通讯员如工人曹永魁等，没有勇敢地给予公开支持，而是消极地把材料转来转去，甚至材料被丢失了，我们也没再去追究，便不了了之。党中央决定中曾指出：“工农通讯员的活动状况，应列为检查报纸工作和各生产单位党的工作的项目之一。任何人不得滥用权力压制工农通讯员在报纸刊物上的批评，或加以报复。”可是，我们却对马成德等这种滥用权利报复通讯员的蛮横行为，采取了不愤怒的消极态度。
    上述这种漠视群众反映的批评意见和没有积极保护通讯员不受迫害的态度，不仅说明我们的党性不强，群众观点薄弱，官僚主义严重，而且说明我们缺乏进行政治斗争的勇气。
    为什么缺乏斗争勇气呢？首先是我们从个人得失考虑太多，既怕坚持批评会受到打击或报复，又怕以后的工作不好做。其次，和我们个人政治思想水平太低有关的，就是：几年来编辑部的思想领导也很薄弱，致使编辑部政治原则空气很淡薄，批评和自我批评也开展得不好，理论政策学习则更差。这就是造成我们编辑部在报纸上不能大胆展开自下而上批评的基本原因。
    当然，我们在报纸上不能展开批评的另一个主要原因，是和中共鞍山市委的领导有关。市委书记韩天石对在报纸上开展批评的问题，曾两次写信给我们，加以限制。这种限制的结果就是，在编辑部普遍滋长了一种消极情绪，报纸上批评稿的数量也显著地减少了。现在检查，我们完全不应该以消极情绪来对待韩天石同志的意见。因为这种消极情绪，不仅使韩天石同志对待报纸批评的错误长期得不到纠正，而且影响了鞍山各种工作更健康地发展。今年一月三日，我们虽然在党报委员会上曾提出意见，要求市委今后讨论和检查报社工作，定期召开党报委员会，审查报道方针、计划、通知报社参加一些必要的会议，等等；但会后已经一个多月了，市委对报纸的领导还无显著的改进。
    今后，我们当接受过去的教训，除继续主动地取得党委的领导外，在编辑部决定从加强理论政策学习，和调查研究两方面入手，以提高报纸的群众性和战斗性。目前，编辑部已结合检查工作，展开关于批评与自我批评的学习。
    这是我们的初步检讨。由于我们损害了党的利益，在执行党的决定上犯了原则性的错误，我们愿意接受党给我们的处分。
