    The Pearl of the Danube – Beautiful Budapest
    Budapest is an ancient and beautiful city in Europe, located in the heart of the Carpathian Mountains, nestled on both banks of the Danube River. The Danube flows quietly like a silver ribbon, with passenger ships and tugboats whistling as they move in procession. Ancient buildings with spires are interspersed among many tall modern buildings. The green and flower-filled Margaret Island floats on the Danube's waters like a mythical fairy island. Iron-chain bridges and steel bridges span the river like scales, connecting the traffic between Buda and Pest. Budapest's geographical location, natural scenery, and beautiful urban architecture have earned it the title of "Pearl of the Danube."
    Towards the end of World War II, German fascist bandits attempted to make a last-ditch stand here. To minimize damage to this beautiful city, Comrade Stalin personally ordered the victorious Soviet army not to bombard Budapest with heavy artillery. The heroic Soviet army finally annihilated the German fascist garrison, liberating Budapest on February 13, 1945.
    The war had inflicted some wounds on Budapest, but in the eight years since the war, thanks to the efforts of the Hungarian working people, Budapest has not only been restored but has also made considerable progress in urban construction.
    Budapest's municipal construction primarily serves the working people. In worker residential areas, such as Csepel, Kőbánya, and the northern districts of Óbuda, Angyalföld, and Újpest, many three- to seven-story apartment buildings have been built, surrounded by flower gardens and parks. These apartments are generally equipped with bathrooms, gas, and heating. Municipal utilities have also developed rapidly. In Hungary's Five-Year Plan, it was decided to allocate over 160 million forints to build water pipes and sewers in the city center and suburbs. The expansion of public transport and train routes has greatly improved transportation between the city center and the outskirts.
    In Angyalföld, the children of workers have received three spacious and well-equipped primary schools, whereas previously they studied in dilapidated and dark wooden houses. A worker's cultural palace named after Rákosi, the city's largest swimming pool, and an obstetrical hospital have also been built in this district. In addition, many sunny and tall factory workshops, auditoriums, and factory clubs have been constructed.
    In the Csepel district, a place with a glorious tradition of working-class struggle, the original appearance has also been completely changed. Flat boulevards lined with trees have replaced muddy alleys, and modern residences have replaced low huts. A new primary school, a technical school for ironworkers, a workshop for apprentice practice, a new hospital, and a new sports field have also been established here. Thirty million forints have been invested in the construction of a grand cultural palace.
    Walking through the streets of Budapest, one can see the city's rapid development. Huge construction projects are underway everywhere: the construction of the People's Stadium, which can accommodate 100,000 people, the University of Engineering, and the new National Theatre have all begun, and the construction of the subway is in progress. The first subway line crossing the Danube, connecting the eastern and western parts of the city, will be completed in 1954.
    New parks are dotted throughout Budapest. Newly planted poplars and blooming flowers add a lot of beauty to the city. Every spring or summer, the entire city becomes more active. Margaret Island and the various parks in the city attract countless tourists and children. Children play their games under the ancient trees and in specially designated "sandlots," hippos and bears perform for their audiences in the zoo, and a variety of exotic flowers and plants make young students who love plants and collect specimens reluctant to leave. The new programs in the open-air theater in Tchaikovsky Park are very popular with the audience.
    Thanks to the continuous efforts of the Hungarian working people, Budapest will become more beautiful day by day. (Attached picture)

    多瑙河之珠——美丽的布达佩斯
    布达佩斯是欧洲的一个古老而美丽的城市，它位于喀尔巴阡山的中心，座落在多瑙河的两岸。多瑙河像一条银色的长带一样静静地流过，鸣着汽笛的客轮和拖船鱼贯前进；尖顶的古老建筑点缀在许多高大的现代建筑物中，满布绿荫和鲜花的马尔基特岛，像一座神话中的仙岛一样，浮现在多瑙河的水面上；一座座铁索大桥和钢桥天平似地架设在河上，连接着布达与佩斯的交通。布达佩斯的地理区位、自然风景和优美的城市建筑，使它获得了“多瑙河之珠”的称号。
    在第二次世界大战快要胜利结束的时候，德国法西斯匪徒曾经企图在这里负隅顽抗。为了使这座美丽的城市少受损失，斯大林同志曾经亲自命令胜利进军的苏联军队不以重炮轰击布达佩斯。英勇的苏联军队终于歼灭了德国法西斯守军，在一九四五年的二月十三日解放了布达佩斯。
    战争曾使布达佩斯遭受了一些创伤，但是战后八年来，在匈牙利劳动人民的努力修建下，布达佩斯不仅早已复原，而且在城市建设方面有了不少的进展。
    布达佩斯的市政建设，首先是为劳动人民服务的。在工人居住的地区，如切普尔、柯巴尼亚与城市北部的采布达、安嘉福尔与乌伊佩斯等地方，已建造了许许多多三层至七层的公寓楼房，并有花圃和公园环绕着。这些公寓房屋大都有浴室、煤气与暖气的设备。市内公用事业也有了迅速的发展。在匈牙利的五年计划中，决定拨款一亿六千多万福林来建造城中心与郊区的水管与下水道。公共车辆与火车路线的扩充，已大大地改善了中心区与郊外的交通。
    在安嘉福尔，工人的子弟们已得到了三所宽敞的、设备完善的小学，而从前他们都在破旧阴暗的木头房子里念书。一座以拉科西为名的工人文化宫，一个全城最大的游泳池和一所产科医院也已在这个区里建造起来。此外，还建造了许多阳光充足的高大的工厂车间、礼堂与工厂俱乐部。
    在切普尔区，这个有着工人阶级斗争的光荣传统的地方，也已完全改变了原来的面貌。平坦的林荫大道代替了泥泞的小巷，现代化的住宅代替了低矮的小屋。这里还建立起了一所新的小学校，一所铁工机械技术学校，一所学徒实习车间，一所新的医院和一所新的运动场。三千万福林已投资于兴建一座宏大的文化宫。
    行走在布达佩斯的街上，人们会看到这个城市迅速发展的景象。巨大的建设工程正在各处进行：可以容纳十万人的人民体育场、工程大学和新的国家剧院的建筑工程都已开始，地下铁道的建设正在进行。第一条穿过多瑙河、连接东西两部分的地下铁道线路，将在一九五四年完工。
    新的公园点缀在布达佩斯市内各处。新栽的白杨和初放的花朵给城市平添不少秀色。每到春季或夏季，整个布达佩斯就更加活跃起来了。马尔基特岛与市内各个公园吸引着无数的游人和儿童。孩子们在古老的大树下面和特设的“沙场”上做着自己的游戏，河马和大熊在动物园中给它们的观众表演，各种各样的奇花异木使爱好植物、采集标本的少年学生留恋不去，柴可夫斯基公园里的露天剧场的新节目极受观众的欢迎。
    由于匈牙利劳动人民的不断努力建设，布达佩斯将变得一天比一天更加美丽。（附图片）
