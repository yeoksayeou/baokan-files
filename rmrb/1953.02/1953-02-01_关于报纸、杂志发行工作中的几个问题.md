Answer to Readers' Questions

    Editor's Note: After the Central People's Government Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications and the General Administration of Publications issued the "Joint Decision on Improving Publication Distribution Work," readers from all over the country wrote to support this decision and also raised some questions. We have summarized these questions and requested responses from the Postal Department of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications and the General Administration of Publications. The full Q&A is now published as follows:

    Q: After the implementation of the subscription system for newspapers and magazines, where should readers subscribe?

    A: After the General Post Office distributes newspapers and magazines, readers no longer need to go through the formalities of writing letters and remitting money. They can subscribe to newspapers and magazines published throughout the country and distributed by the Post Office at the nearest post office.

    Q: Why can I only subscribe to magazines for one quarter now, and not for half a year or a year?

    A: In 1953, newspapers and magazines began to implement planned distribution. Some magazines will be adjusted, and the publication dates of some magazines will be rearranged. Therefore, only subscriptions for one quarter are being solicited temporarily. From May onwards, newspapers and periodicals will uniformly implement a "regular subscription system," and readers can subscribe to newspapers and magazines for one quarter, half a year, three quarters, or a full year, but cannot subscribe across years.

    Q: Why were some magazines no longer accepting subscriptions as early as the beginning of January in the first quarter of this year?

    A: This is because the number of subscriptions for some magazines in certain regions has reached the quota. According to the principle of planned distribution, various magazines are distributed in a certain quantity in a certain region during a certain period according to their distribution targets. Once the subscription quota is full, the solicitation of subscribers will be suspended. In the future, depending on the growth of readers' needs, new subscribers will be solicited in another quarter or year.

    Q: Why can't some magazines be supplied as much as possible at present, and subscriptions are limited?

    A: Generally speaking, the total number of various magazines currently distributed can meet the needs of readers; at the same time, many magazines are published in too large quantities, exceeding the actual needs of readers. However, why can't some readers subscribe to the magazines they need? This is because there are still some shortcomings in our distribution work: we have not conducted a good survey of the number of readers who need to subscribe to magazines by region, and distributed them according to the needed quantity; we have not understood the content and nature of the magazines, and distributed them according to the distribution targets of the magazines. Therefore, on the one hand, many magazines are distributed to readers who do not need or do not need them very much; on the other hand, readers who urgently need them cannot subscribe to magazines. In order to improve distribution work and rationally supply readers' needs, it is necessary to control the distribution quantity, implement planned distribution and subscription system, and make necessary adjustments to the current distribution situation to solve the current unreasonable phenomenon of supply and demand disconnection and production and marketing imbalance to a certain extent. Now, the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications and the General Administration of Publications are making this effort.

    Q: After the implementation of the subscription system, how are the post office and bookstores divided?

    A: The General Post Office is responsible for the general distribution of newspapers and magazines; the general distribution of irregular publications (including textbooks, general books and pictures) is the responsibility of bookstores. However, bookstores above the county level may purchase magazines from the post office for retail business; the post office may purchase irregular publications from bookstores for retail business. Local bookstores continue to handle magazine subscription work, and send the orders and payment to the local post office after receiving the subscriptions. In this way, the post office and bookstores have a reasonable division of labor, which can better do a good job in distribution work, play the due role of serving readers, and reduce duplication, waste, and confusion in work.

    Q: Why is there no discount preferential treatment method when the post office distributes newspapers and magazines?

    A: If the post office implements discount preferential treatment when distributing newspapers and magazines, then readers who subscribe to the same newspaper or magazine will be divided into a minority of readers who receive discount preferential treatment and a majority of readers who do not receive discount preferential treatment. The money paid less by the minority of readers who receive discount preferential treatment must be borne by the majority of readers who do not receive discount preferential treatment. This is unreasonable. In addition, in order to reduce the price of newspapers and periodicals and reduce the economic burden on the majority of readers, it is necessary to reduce distribution costs and simplify distribution procedures. If there is a discount preferential treatment method in the distribution work, it will complicate the procedures, waste manpower, increase expenses, and increase costs. Therefore, in the current distribution work of newspapers and magazines, there is no provision for a method of discount preferential treatment for readers.

### 关于报纸、杂志发行工作中的几个问题

    关于报纸、杂志发行工作中的几个问题
    编者按：中央人民政府邮电部和出版总署发布了“关于改进出版物发行工作的联合决定”后，
    各地读者纷纷来信拥护这个决定，同时也提出
    了一些问题。我们综合了这些问题，并请邮电
    部邮政总局和出版总署作了答复。现在将全部
    问答公开发表如下：
    问：报纸、杂志实行预订制度后，读者应该到那里去订阅？
    答：报纸、杂志由邮电局总发行后，读者可以不必再经过写信、汇款等手续，只要到最近的任何一个邮电局机构就可订到全国各地出版的、由邮电局发行的报纸和杂志。
    问：为什么现在只能预订一季的杂志，而不能预订半年或一年？
    答：一九五三年报纸杂志开始实行计划发行，有些杂志将作调整，有些杂志的出版日期要重新安排，故暂时只征订一个季度的预订户。从五月份起，报刊一律实行“定期预订制度”，读者即可预订一季、半年、三季、全年的报纸杂志，但不能跨年订阅。
    问：今年第一季中，为什么某些杂志在一月初即不再接受预订？
    答：这是因为某些杂志在一定地区的预订份数已经满额。按计划发行原则，各种杂志按其发行对象，一定时期在一定地区只发行一定数量。预订额满，即暂停征收订户。以后视读者需要的增长情形，在另一季度或年度再行征收新的订户。
    问：为什么目前某些杂志不能尽量供应，而限制订阅？
    答：目前各种杂志的总发行数，一般说来，是能满足读者需要的；同时也有不少杂志出版数量太大，超过读者实际需要。但是，为什么有些读者又订不到他所需要的杂志呢？这是因为我们发行工作上还有着一些缺点：没有很好地按地区调查需订杂志的读者数量，并根据需要数量进行发行；没有了解杂志的内容、性质，并根据杂志的发行对象进行发行。因此，一方面有很多杂志发行到不需要或不很需要的读者手中；另一方面，迫切需要的读者却订不到杂志。为了改进发行工作、合理地供应读者需要，就必须控制发行数量，实行计划发行和预订制度，并对现在的发行情况进行必要的调整，解决现在这种某种程度的供应脱节、产销失调的不合理现象。现在，邮电部和出版总署正在作这种努力。
    问：实行预订制度后，邮电局与书店是怎样分工的？
    答：报纸、杂志的总发行由邮电局负责；不定期出版物（包括课本，一般图书及图片）的总发行由书店负责。但县级以上书店得向邮电局批入杂志，经营零售业务；邮电局得向书店批入不定期出版物，经营零售业务。各地书店均继续办理杂志代订工作，收订后即将订单及刊款送交当地邮电局。这样，邮电局和书店有了合理分工，就能更好地搞好发行工作，发挥为读者服务的应有作用，减少工作中的重复、浪费和混乱现象。
    问：邮电局发行报纸、杂志时为什么没有折扣优待的办法？
    答：如果邮电局在发行报纸、杂志时实行折扣优待的办法，那末，订阅同一报纸或杂志的读者，就分为受折扣优待的少数读者和不受折扣优待的多数读者。受折扣优待的少数读者少付出的钱，就得由大多数不受折扣优待的读者来负担。这是不合理的。此外，为使报刊价格减低、以减轻广大读者的经济负担，就必须减低发行成本，简化发行手续。如果发行工作中有折扣优待的办法，就会使手续复杂，人力浪费，开支增加，成本提高。因此，现在报纸、杂志的发行工作中，就不规定有折扣优待读者的办法。
