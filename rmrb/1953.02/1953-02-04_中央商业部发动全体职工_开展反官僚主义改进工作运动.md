Xinhua News Agency, 3rd: The Central People's Government Ministry of Commerce is currently launching a movement to combat bureaucracy and improve the work of the organization. This movement began on January 27th and is expected to end in two weeks. On January 27th, Vice Minister of Commerce Yao Yilin gave a mobilization report at a general staff meeting. He first explained that 1953 is the first year of our country's large-scale economic construction, and the state has given the commercial sector's entire staff even greater and more glorious tasks. Therefore, the commercial sector must this year comprehensively implement the economic accounting system, complete the sales quota and remittance tasks, improve work, improve quality, and strive to learn and improve political and professional levels. Regarding the bureaucracy currently existing in the commercial sector, Yao Yilin pointed out that its main manifestations are in three aspects: First, cadres and employees in the organization, especially leading cadres, have not universally recognized the position and role of state-owned commerce in the market. The planning department has not undertaken the work of studying the market economy, studying the people's purchasing power, studying the balance of production and sales of commodities put into the market, analyzing market conditions, and summarizing people's needs. The commercial planning department has also failed to recognize its role, and therefore has failed to correctly arrange the work of all aspects of the Ministry of Commerce. Leaders at all levels have failed to effectively establish a responsibility system, causing the phenomenon of business being divorced from politics throughout the organization. Second, criticism and self-criticism, especially bottom-up criticism, have not been widely carried out. Leaders at all levels have not attached importance to relying on all employees to do their work well. This is manifested in the fact that leaders at all levels have not always explained the work tasks and plans clearly to all employees, mobilized everyone to discuss, modify, and supplement them, so that the tasks assigned to the Ministry of Commerce by the state become the masses' own tasks, and made organizational and individual plans. Although the criticism in the organization has improved somewhat after the Three-Anti Campaign and the Party rectification, it has not formed a system. Starting from the leadership of the ministry, many cadres have not deeply realized that the masses' criticism is a manifestation of the masses' concern and responsibility for the country. They have not adopted an upright and sincere attitude to treat criticism and improve their work based on criticism. In the past, the leadership has not regarded those who do not accept criticism or suppress criticism as the deadly enemies of the people's cause and struggled against them, and has shown a lack of clear-cut banners in front of the masses. Third, there is a serious supply system mentality in the Ministry of Commerce's organization, manifested in irresponsible reliance on superiors and a lazy style of not calculating detailed accounts. If this mentality is not corrected, it is impossible to establish a responsibility system. Yao Yilin finally pointed out that due to the fact that state-owned commercial work has achieved some successes in the past three years, leading cadres have developed a sense of pride, complacency, and self-satisfaction, dislike listening to criticism, push responsibility to objective reasons, and fail to face up to and correct shortcomings and errors. The leadership of the Ministry of Commerce also has this kind of mentality, and therefore cannot improve their work in a timely manner. Therefore, he called on all employees to launch a movement to combat bureaucracy and improve the work of the organization, to promote democracy, to boldly expose shortcomings in work, and to study methods of correction.

    中央商业部发动全体职工
    开展反官僚主义改进工作运动
    【新华社三日讯】中央人民政府商业部现正开展一个反对官僚主义改进机关工作的运动。这一运动从一月二十七日开始，预计两周后结束。一月二十七日商业部副部长姚依林在全体职工大会上作动员报告。他首先说明一九五三年是我们国家大规模经济建设的第一年，国家给了商业部门全体职工更大更光荣的任务。因此，商业部门今年必须完成全面实行经济核算制、完成卖钱额和上缴任务、改进工作、提高质量、努力学习提高政治与业务水平。关于商业部门中目前存在着的官僚主义，姚依林指出其主要表现在三方面：一，机关干部职工中，特别是领导干部，还没有普遍认识国营商业在市场上的地位和作用，计划部门还没有担负起研究市场经济，研究人民的购买力，研究投入市场的商品的产销平衡，分析市场情况，总结人民需要等工作。商业计划部门也同样没有认识到自己的作用，因而未能正确地安排商业部各方面的工作。各级领导未能有效地建立责任制，促使整个机关产生业务与政治脱节的现象。二，没有广泛地开展批评与自我批评，特别是自下而上的批评。各级领导没有重视依靠全体职工做好工作的意义。这表现在，各级领导干部没经常把工作任务和计划向全体职工交代清楚，发动大家讨论、修改、补充，使国家交给商业部的任务成为群众自己的任务，并做出机关的与个人的计划。机关中的批评，在三反运动后及整党后虽有若干改进，但没有形成一种制度，从部的领导起，许多干部没有深刻认识到群众的批评是群众对国家关怀和负责的表现。没有采取正直的诚恳的态度去对待批评，根据批评来改进工作。领导方面过去对于有些不接受批评或压制批评的人，没有当作人民事业的死敌而向其进行斗争，在群众面前表现了旗帜不鲜明。三，商业部机关中存在着严重的供给制思想，表现在不负责任的依赖上级和不算细账的懒惰作风，这种思想不纠正，是不可能建立责任制的。姚依林最后指出，由于三年来，国营商业工作有些成绩，领导干部中产生了骄傲自满和沾沾自喜的情绪，不喜欢听取批评，把责任推之于客观，不正视并改正缺点与错误，商业部领导上同样也存在着这种情绪，因而不能及时地改进自己的工作。因此，他号召全体职工开展一个反官僚主义改进机关工作的运动，发扬民主，大胆揭发工作中的缺点，并研究改正办法。
