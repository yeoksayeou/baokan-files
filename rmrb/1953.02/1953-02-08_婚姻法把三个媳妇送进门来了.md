The Marriage Law Brought Three Daughters-in-Law Through the Door
Shu Hui
In the past, in some rural areas, there was a saying that "poor and hired peasants have turned over, and their wives divorced." Is this saying correct? Let's look at the story of Zhang Sanmei's family in Houyang Township, District Three, Leping County, Jiangxi Province.

Zhang Sanmei has five sons, three daughters-in-law, two daughters, two grandsons, a mother-in-law, plus her husband and herself, a total of fifteen people. The eldest, Zhang Cai, and the third, Zhang Gui, both work in mines. The second son, Zhang Yuan, is a bridge worker. The fourth, Zhang Huo, the fifth, Zhang Xie, the youngest daughter, Ai Yun, and the third daughter-in-law, Lao Mei, are all in elementary school. The eldest daughter, Yuan Zhi, is married and is a member of the Communist Youth League. Zhang Huo and Zhang Xie are both members of the Young Pioneers. Zhang Sanmei's husband, Hu Jinghuai, is an honest and kind farmer. Her mother-in-law is over seventy years old, and her grandson is only a few months old.

Zhang Sanmei gave birth to seven boys and three girls after marrying into the family at the age of eighteen. At that time, the family of a dozen people relied solely on Hu Jinghuai for support. He farmed three and a half mu of land for the landlord and had to pay seven dan of rent a year. He farmed four mu of public land and had to pay more than two dan of grain each year. Every year, they were out of rice as soon as they put down their sickles. The children were all pale and thin, without a single good thread on their bodies. During the New Year and festivals, wealthy families slaughtered chickens, bought meat, and made sweets and fruits, but Zhang Sanmei's home was cold and empty. It didn't matter if the adults had nothing to eat, but the children would make a fuss if they had nothing. Zhang Sanmei often used turnips to coax the children:
	"Good children, don't go out, stay in the house and cook turnips to eat." Two sons and one daughter died in this bitter life.

The hard days never ended. That year, Zhang Cai was nineteen years old and just able to do some work when the Kuomintang reactionaries came to arrest him as a conscript. At that time, Hu Jinghuai was out pushing a cart, and Zhang Sanmei was the only one in charge at home. If her son was taken away, the whole family would starve to death. But they didn't have money to pay for a replacement. She thought of selling her share of the public land, but someone advised her: "Land is the foundation of life. If a child grows up, one will be conscripted. It's better to sell a child and keep the land." Zhang Sanmei tossed and turned for several nights without sleep. Sell the child, the flesh on her body, it was difficult to part with; don't sell, where would the conscription money come from? With a determined heart, she decided to sell her youngest son. The buyer looked at the child, saw that he was clever, and was willing to buy him. Three-year-old Zhang Xie understood things, and he wouldn't go no matter what, hugging his mother's leg and crying, "Mom, don't sell me." The child's cries pained the mother's heart, and the mother couldn't bear to part with the child either.

In the end, she sold the land and mortgaged the house deed for two thousand catties of grain to pay for the replacement. From then on, Zhang Sanmei's family was always in debt, and life was even harder than before. Hu Jinghuai became angry at the slightest provocation, and the eldest son angrily beat his chest, vowing to commit suicide. Zhang Sanmei shed tears in her stomach, suffering in her heart. Whenever Hu Jinghuai lost his temper, Zhang Sanmei would say, "Forget it, we don't even have enough to eat, what's the use of arguing?" She also advised her son: "It's not just our family that's suffering, everyone is the same, there will always be a day when we get out of this misery."

Zhang Sanmei also had something else on her mind: her sons were all grown up, but none of them had a wife. Thinking of her sons' marriages, Zhang Sanmei felt like she had a disease: "They're almost thirty years old, and people the same age as them have had several children, but my children are still single." The old woman eagerly hoped for a daughter-in-law, hoping every day that someone would come to be a matchmaker. However, others disliked her family's weak foundation and large number of people, and were unwilling to give her their daughters. Her aunt helped Zhang Cai find one, but she wanted four sets of clothes, two qian of gold, and eight hundred "mazi" (old currency). It didn't work out. Later, someone acted as a matchmaker for Zhang Yuan, but this time the betrothal gifts were even more expensive, including serge and spun silk, which they couldn't afford even if they sold all their possessions. It didn't work out either. Zhang Sanmei had been bitterly hoping for a daughter-in-law to enter the door, but her sons remained single.

After liberation, Zhang Cai, Zhang Yuan, and Zhang Gui all joined the workforce. During the land reform, her family was allocated nine mu of land, and their lives improved day by day. Although life had improved, her sons still hadn't married wives.

In 1950, the Marriage Law was promulgated, and soon after, it was publicized in Houyang Township. Zhang Sanmei was really happy to hear that marriage didn't involve buying and selling and didn't require money. She thought, "If it's really like this, then I won't have to worry about not having a daughter-in-law." She also especially supported the ban on child brides and told everyone she met, "Boys and girls should be treated the same, and don't ever send your daughters out to be child brides." Her eldest daughter, Yuan Zhi, had suffered a lot as a child bride in the past. When Yuan Zhi was eleven years old, her family had nothing to eat, and she was sent to the Xu family to be a child bride. Coincidentally, the Xu family's son fell ill that year, and they said it was because her "fate" was bad and sent her back to her mother's house. The following year, she was given to a camphor dealer who ran a pharmacy as a child bride. Soon after, another son of the camphor dealer was dragged off to be a conscript, and it was also said that her fate was bad, and she was sent back to her mother's house again. The third time she was given to the Li family in Xiahutou, she suffered even more. At the age of fourteen, she had to do everything from working in the fields to pumping water, and she was also beaten and scolded. Her body was pinched black and blue, and she couldn't even eat her fill. After two years in the Li family, the Li family lost a cow and several pigs died of plague, and they blamed it on her fate and sent her back to her mother's house. At this time, Yuan Zhi was already seventeen years old. Later, she found a lover herself, and the couple had a very good relationship. Now Yuan Zhi is studying new midwifery methods in the Leping County Health Center and is a member of the Communist Youth League.

Sure enough, the Marriage Law brought happiness to Zhang Sanmei's family—they married three daughters-in-law in 1951 alone. The whole family was overjoyed. Zhang Sanmei told everyone she met, "Chairman Mao helped my children get wives." Hu Jinghuai would crack a smile whenever he mentioned this. The sons, needless to say, became even more enthusiastic about production after getting married. Because of their active production and work, Zhang Cai was promoted to cadre last year.

All three daughters-in-law came voluntarily, without spending a penny. The eldest is called Zou Qiuxiang, twenty years old. She and Zhang Cai met like this: Zhang Cai had an aunt who lived in Leping Town, and whenever he went home on Sundays, he would pass through Leping Town and always visit his aunt's house. His aunt was also Zou Qiuxiang's aunt, and Zou Qiuxiang often came here to play. The two of them often ran into each other and slowly became familiar. The aunt saw that they were doing well and came to be a "matchmaker." When they got married, the two discussed that in order to save money, they wouldn't take a sedan chair or a car, but would walk. That day it happened to be raining, and they only bought a pair of rubber shoes temporarily.

Zhang Yuan's wife is called Cheng Lianqing, twenty-two years old, and she used to be a cadre of the Leping Town Street Women's Representative Conference. Their love affair lasted longer than the eldest brother's. In nine months, Lianqing made two pairs of shoes for Zhang Yuan; Zhang Yuan also bought her two sets of clothes.

The third daughter-in-law, Lao Mei, was a cowherd girl, without parents, living with her uncle. Zhang Gui used to herd cattle with her when he was little. One day, Lao Mei's uncle told Zhang Sanmei that he wanted to marry his niece to Zhang Gui. Zhang Sanmei didn't dare to agree, saying, "Now the marriages of children are decided by the children themselves." When Zhang Gui came back on Sunday, his mother told him about this, and he went to Lao Mei's place. The two met, talked, and were both willing in their hearts, but they were too embarrassed to say it. When he was about to leave, Zhang Gui said to her like this: "My family is large, if you are willing, come to my house within three days." The next day, Lao Mei really came. The family was naturally happy to see her. Seeing that she didn't have any clothes, they made her some clothes and she stayed. Because Lao Mei was only seventeen years old, not old enough to get married, they haven't gotten married yet.

The daughters-in-law entered the door the year before last, and last year they added two grandsons. Zhang Sanmei was so happy that she couldn't close her mouth. Looking at her daughters-in-law and grandsons, she would smile to herself. She often said, "If Chairman Mao hadn't issued the Marriage Law, how could my family have added five people in two years?"

Now Zhang Sanmei's family is a large family with many sisters-in-law, but the whole family is very harmonious. Zhang Sanmei is the leader of the family and leads the whole family in a criticism meeting once a week, where opinions are resolved. Doing anything and buying anything is also decided democratically. Zhang Sanmei's democratic style has been supported by the whole family.

Once, Lao Mei was lying in bed and not eating, and her mother-in-law thought she was sick and asked her what was wrong. It turned out that she had an opinion because she saw Ai Yun going to school but wasn't allowed to go herself. After this opinion was raised, Zhang Sanmei immediately agreed. The two older sisters-in-law also said, "You go to school, we'll do the housework." In the end, Lao Mei smiled. Zhang Sanmei also patiently explained some incorrect opinions. For example, Ai Yun and Qiuxiang argued a few times over picking cotton: Ai Yun said her sister-in-law didn't go to the fields; Qiuxiang said she wasn't idle at home. Although she said this, she still went to the fields later. When the family meeting was held, Ai Yun brought up this opinion again. Zhang Sanmei listened on the side, and after everyone had finished speaking, she finally said, "Sisters-in-law should help each other. Qiuxiang's belly is big, and it's really inconvenient to go to the fields. I think let her cook at home!" The others also said that she should be taken care of because her body was large. Ai Yun thought for a while and felt that everyone's words were right. Her sister-in-law was so big, and she would be out of breath from exhaustion when she picked cotton. She was not considerate of her at all and even raised opinions; besides, her sister-in-law also did a lot of work at home, wasn't it true that she had food as soon as she got home? The more she thought about it, the more she felt sorry for her sister-in-law and made a self-criticism.

Democratic life has promoted family harmony. The sisters-in-law are like real sisters. When Ai Yun and Lao Mei go to school and want to make a uniform, Qiuxiang quickly takes out her two uniforms: "Let you wear them, it's not convenient for me to breastfeed." When making shoes, one twists the rope and the other sews the soles; they also go to the fields together and return together; they are even more affectionate when eating; if there is a good dish, you let me eat it, and I put it in your bowl.

The mother-in-law and daughter-in-law are even closer than a mother and daughter. When Xiang Qiu and Lianqing gave birth, there were chickens, longan, and brown sugar. Each person ate forty or fifty eggs. When the daughters-in-law went to a meeting and didn't come back to eat, the mother-in-law put the food in the pot to keep it from getting cold. The daughters-in-law also respected their mother-in-law very much. Last year, Zhang Sanmei was ill for more than four months, and the daughters-in-law often fed her tea and soup, and emptied her chamber pot. They also stayed with their mother-in-law at night. When the illness was severe, one wiped away tears and the other called "Mom." Zhang Sanmei knew what her daughters-in-law were thinking and comforted them, saying, "Don't be sad, I'll get better."

Sometimes the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law would even joke. Zhang Sanmei said to Lao Mei, "Lao Mei, you go back, it's not allowed to have child brides now. If you stay in my house, people will say that I'm violating the Marriage Law." "No, I won't go back, I came voluntarily..." The mother-in-law saw that her daughter-in-law took it seriously and laughed. Lao Mei also shyly chuckled.

When the sons come back, it's even more lively. The couples meet and talk and laugh. Over there, Zhang Gui and Lao Mei, one burns the fire and the other cooks. Zhang Gui encourages Lao Mei to study hard and even says he will buy her a fountain pen. Over here, Zhang Cai and Qiuxiang hold the child, look at it again and again, and kiss it again and again. The old lady sees it in her eyes and laughs in her heart.

Zhang Sanmei deeply understands the benefits of the Marriage Law. Ai Yun is seventeen years old, and Zhang Sanmei is determined to let her find an object herself, encouraging her daughter to participate in social activities such as playing flower sticks and singing. In order to give her daughter more opportunities to meet young lads, she is also preparing to let Ai Yun participate in the rural opera troupe.

Last year's harvest in the fields was very good, and the three sons' monthly salaries together were more than one million. The whole family made new clothes and also made two large cotton quilts weighing twelve catties each. The small cow was replaced with a larger one, and plows and harrows and agricultural implements were all complete. They hadn't hired a master for thirty years, but last year they hired masters (carpenters and bamboo craftsmen) and added grain baskets, drying mats, and rice sieves, and repaired the carts. Zhang Sanmei and Hu Jinghuai are getting younger and younger, learning with their sons, daughters, and daughters-in-law at night. Hu Jinghuai teaches the children to calculate on the abacus and teaches everyone to sing; the children teach their mother to write and read. Sometimes the whole family has a big chorus. Although Zhang Sanmei sings out of tune, she remembers all the lyrics. The children know this, and when they forget the lyrics, they ask her, "Mom, what's the next line?" "... No longer people with sad faces." Everyone continues to sing.

Everyone who sees Zhang Sanmei's family envies them. In late December last year, at the "Model Conference for Implementing the Marriage Law" in Leping County, Zhang Sanmei's family was selected as the first-class model family in the county. People say that her family's turnaround is complete.

    婚姻法把三个媳妇送进门来了
    舒慧
    过去，在部分农村中，曾流行着所谓“贫雇农翻了身，老婆离了婚”的说法。这样说法对不对呢？请看江西省乐平县三区后阳乡张三妹家庭的故事。
    张三妹有五个儿子，三个媳妇，两个女儿，两个孙子，一个婆婆，加上她夫妻俩一共十五口人。老大长财、老三长贵，都在矿山做工。老二长源是桥梁工人。老四长火、老五长谐和小女爱云、三媳老妹在小学读书。大女圆芝已出嫁，是个青年团员。长火、长谐都是少年儿童队员。张三妹的丈夫胡景淮是一个忠厚老实的农民。婆婆七十多岁，孙子才几个月。
    张三妹十八岁过门后，一连生了七个男孩，三个女孩。那时候，一家十几口人，只靠胡景淮一个人养活。种了地主三亩五分田，一年要交七担租。种的四亩众田（公众的田），每年要交二担多谷。年年都是放下镰刀没有米。孩子个个面黄肌瘦，身上没有一根好纱。过年过节，有钱的人家杀鸡买肉，做糖做果，张三妹家却是冷冷清清。大人没吃的不要紧，孩子没吃的就闹。张三妹常用萝卜哄孩子：
    “乖孩子，不要出去，在屋里烧萝卜吃。”两个儿子、一个女儿就在这苦日子里熬煎死了。
    苦日子没完没了。那年长财十九岁，刚刚能做些事情，国民党反动派就来抓他当壮丁。那时胡景淮推车在外，家里只有张三妹当家。要是儿子被拉走，一家人就会饿死。但又没有钱顶壮丁。想把众田里自己的那份卖掉，又有人劝说：“田是养命根，孩子长大一个就要抽一个，不如卖一个孩子，留住田。”张三妹翻来覆去几晚没有睡。卖孩子吧，身上的肉，难割难舍；不卖吧，壮丁钱从何处出？心一横，决定把最小的儿子卖掉。买主看了人，见孩子长得伶俐，愿意买。三岁的长谐却懂得事，死活不去，抱住娘的腿，哭叫着：“姆妈，不要卖我。”孩子哭痛了娘的心，娘也舍不得孩子。
    最后还是卖了田，又拿房契押了两千斤谷，顶了壮丁。从此以后，张三妹家年年不离债，生活比以前更苦了。胡景淮变得动不动就发脾气，大儿子气得老捶胸，口口声声要自杀。张三妹是眼泪往肚里流，苦在心里。胡景淮一发脾气，张三妹就说：“罢了，吃都没有吃，还吵什么？”又劝儿子：“不是我们一家苦，大家都一样，总有苦出头的日子。”
    张三妹还有放不下的心事：儿子个个都大了，还没有一个有老婆的。想起儿子的亲事，张三妹心里就像有块病：“快三十的人了，人家同年的人，孩子都生了几个，自己的孩子还是光棍。”老人家盼媳妇的心切，天天希望人来说媒。可是，别人都嫌她家底子薄，人多，不愿意把女儿给她。姑妈帮长财找了一个，但要四套衣服，两钱金子，八百麻子。没说成。以后又有人给长源作媒，这次要的彩礼更多，还要哔叽、纺绸，全部家当卖光都买不起那些东西。又没有说成。张三妹一直苦苦地盼着媳妇进门，但儿子一直是单身。
    解放了，长财、长源、长贵都参加了工作。土地改革时，她家分到九亩田，生活一天比一天好起来。虽然日子过好了，儿子还是没有娶上媳妇。
    一九五○年颁布了婚姻法，不久，后阳乡就宣传开了。张三妹听说结婚不兴买卖，不要钱，心里着实高兴。她想：“要是真能这样，就不愁没有媳妇了。”禁止童养媳这一条，她也特别拥护，见人就宣传：“男孩、女孩要一样看待，千万不要把闺女抱出去当童养媳。”原来她的大女儿圆芝过去当童养媳受了很多折磨。圆芝十一岁的时候，家里没吃的，被送到徐家做童养媳。碰巧那年徐家的儿子得了病，就说是因为她的“八字”不好，把她送回了娘家。第二年又给开药铺的樟树佬做童养媳。不久樟树佬另一个儿子被拉去当壮丁，也说是她的命不好，又送回娘家。第三次给下湖头李家，更遭罪。十四岁的人，下田、车水，样样都要做，还挨打受骂。身上被拧得青一块、紫一块，饭也吃不饱。在李家过了两年，李家死了一条牛，瘟死几只猪，又怪在她的命上，送回娘家。这时圆芝已十七岁了，以后她自己找了一个爱人，夫妻感情很好。现在圆芝在乐平县卫生院学习新法接生，是青年团员。
    果真，婚姻法给张三妹家带来了幸福——一九五一年一年就娶进了三个媳妇。一家人高兴得不得了。张三妹逢人就说：“毛主席帮我孩子娶了媳妇。”胡景淮提起这件事先裂开嘴笑。儿子更不消说，结婚后生产越发起劲了。因为生产、工作积极，长财去年被提拔为干部。
    这三个媳妇都是自愿来的，没有化一个钱。大的叫邹秋香，二十岁。她和长财是这样认识的：长财有个姑妈住在乐平镇，他星期天回家从乐平镇经过，总要到姑妈家坐一坐。他的姑妈又是邹秋香的舅母，邹秋香也常来这里玩。两个人常碰在一起，慢慢地就熟了。姑妈见他们很好，便来作“介绍”人。结婚时，两人商量，为了节省，不坐轿也不坐车，走去。那天正碰上下雨，只临时买了双胶鞋。
    长源的媳妇叫程莲清，二十二岁，过去是乐平镇街妇女代表会的干部。他们恋爱时间比老大更早更长。九个月中，莲清给长源做过两双鞋；长源也给她买过两套衣服。
    三媳妇老妹是个放牛的女孩子，没爹没妈，跟着伯父过日子。长贵小时和她在一块放过牛。有一天，老妹的伯父对张三妹讲，要把侄女许配长贵。张三妹不敢答应，说：“现在儿女的亲事要儿女自己作主。”星期天长贵回来，娘把这件事告诉了他，他就到老妹那里去。两人见了面，说了话，心里都愿意，就是不好意思说出来。临走时，长贵才这样对她说：“我家人多，你愿意，三天之内就到我家去。”第二天，老妹真的来了。家里人见了自然高兴，见她没有衣服，给她做了几件衣服，就住下了。因为老妹只有十七岁，不到结婚年龄，还没有结婚。
    媳妇前年进门，去年就添了两个孙子。张三妹喜得合不拢嘴。看看媳妇，望望孙子，自己一个人都会笑。她常常这样说：“不是毛主席出了婚姻法，我家那能两年就加五口人。”
    现在张三妹家庭是一个妯娌众多的大家庭了，可是全家非常和睦。张三妹是一家的组长，一星期领导全家开一次检讨会，有意见在会上解决。做什么事，买什么东西也是民主决定。张三妹的民主作风，得到全家人的拥护。
    有一次，老妹睡在床上不吃饭，婆婆以为她有病，问她那里不舒服。原来是她见爱云上了学，没让她也去，有了意见。这意见提出后，马上得到张三妹的同意。两个嫂嫂也说：“你去上学，家里的事情我们来做。”最后老妹笑了。有些不正确的意见，张三妹也很耐心地解释。譬如为了摘棉花的事，爱云和秋香顶了几句：爱云说嫂嫂不下地；秋香说她不是在家闲着，虽然这样说，以后还是下地了。开家庭会时，爱云又把这意见提出来。张三妹在一旁听着，等大家说完了，最后说：“姑嫂要互相帮助，秋香肚子大了，下地实在不方便。我看就让她在家做饭吧！”其他的人也说，身子大了应当照顾。爱云想了想，觉得大家的话很对，嫂嫂那样大的身子，一摘棉花就累得气喘，自己一点不体贴她，还提意见；再说，嫂嫂在家也干很多活，不是回家就有饭吃吗？越想越觉得对不起嫂嫂，自己做了检讨。
    民主生活促进了家庭和睦。妯娌、姑嫂就像亲姐妹。爱云、老妹上学，想做件制服，秋香赶紧把自己的两件制服拿出来：“给你们穿吧，我穿着不好喂奶。”做起鞋来，一个搓绳，一个纳底；下地也是同去同回；吃饭时更亲昵；有点好菜，你让给我吃，我挟给你吃。
    婆媳比母女还亲。香秋、莲清生孩子，又是鸡、又是桂圆、又是红糖，光鸡蛋每个人都吃了四、五十个。媳妇开会去了，没回来吃饭，婆婆就把饭放在锅里，免得冷了。媳妇对婆婆也很尊敬。去年张三妹病了四个多月，媳妇们经常在身边喂茶喂汤，倒屎倒尿。晚上也陪着婆婆。病厉害时，这个抹眼泪，那个叫“姆妈”，张三妹知道媳妇的心事，安慰她们说：“不要难过，我会好的。”
    有时婆媳还开开玩笑。张三妹对老妹说：“老妹，你回去吧，现在不准带童养媳，你在我家，人家会说我违犯婚姻法。”“不，我不回去，我是自愿来的。……”婆婆见媳妇信以为真，笑了。老妹也不好意思地吃吃笑起来。
    儿子回来以后，更热闹。夫妻见面又说又笑。那边长贵和老妹，一个烧火，一个做饭。长贵鼓励老妹努力学习，还说买支钢笔送她。这边长财和秋香抱着孩子，看了又看，吻了又吻。老娘看在眼里，笑在心里。
    张三妹深深体会到婚姻法的好处。爱云十七岁了，张三妹拿定主意让她自己找对象，鼓励女儿参加打花棍、唱歌等社会活动。为了使女儿有更多的机会和青年小伙子接触，她还准备让爱云参加农村剧团。
    去年田里的收成很好，三个儿子一个月的工资合起来又有百来万，全家都做了新衣服，还弹了两床十二斤重的大棉被。小牛换成了大的，犁耙、农具样样都齐全。三十来年没有请过师傅，去年也请了师傅（木匠、篾匠），添置了谷箩、晒垫、米筛，修理了车子。张三妹、胡景淮越过越年轻，晚上和儿子、女儿、媳妇在一块学习。胡景淮教孩子们打算盘，教大家唱歌；孩子教妈妈写字、读书。有时全家人来个大合唱，张三妹唱得调子虽然不准，歌词可是都记得。孩子们知道这一点，唱忘了，就朝着她问：“姆妈、下一句是什么？”“……再不是愁眉苦脸的人。”大家又接着唱下去。
    张三妹的家庭，谁看了都羡慕。去年十二月下旬，在乐平县“贯彻婚姻法模范大会”上，张三妹的家庭被选为全县一等模范家庭。人们都说：她家翻身算翻彻底了。
