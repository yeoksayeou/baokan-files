Xinhua News Agency, 10th Dispatch: After concluding their unsuccessful tour of Europe, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles and "Mutual Security Agency" Director Stassen left Europe on the 8th to return to the United States. After leaving Bonn, West Germany, on the 6th, they traveled to the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg, continuing their mission, which had repeatedly encountered setbacks in Paris, London, and other places. As they began their journey home from Luxembourg on the 8th, they carried with them a pile of requests from Western European vassal states, but made no definite progress on the task of supervising "Western European unification."

According to a United Press report, after Dulles arrived in The Hague, the capital of the Netherlands, Dutch government leaders complained to him that the recent floods in the Netherlands had caused losses roughly equivalent to the amount the Netherlands had allocated this year for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's arms expansion plan. Therefore, the Netherlands would not be able to fulfill its arms expansion "obligations" this year. They also told Dulles that the Netherlands might also need "dollar aid" as a result. The Dutch government stated that it "valued" the "Western European unification" plan, but at the same time emphasized its dissatisfaction with the "high trade barriers" of the United States.

In Brussels, the capital of Belgium, Dulles was told that Belgium wanted its neighbors, France and West Germany, to effectively undertake the obligations of the "European Army" treaty before it was willing to contribute its several divisions of troops. Belgian government leaders asked Dulles to note that the Belgian government had faced fierce opposition from the Belgian people on the issue of extending military service, causing a political crisis. They told Dulles that if the "European Army" treaty were rashly approved now, the Belgian government would find itself in "the same, if not dangerous, at least embarrassing situation." According to the United Press, the Belgian government, "like other European defense group countries," demanded "a large amount of military equipment purchased with dollars" and dollar military orders.

In Luxembourg, Dulles addressed a meeting of the Western European Coal and Steel Community, repeating his threatening words, saying that for America's "unified Europe" "cause," "Europe must make important contributions." While repeating his absurd remarks, Dulles said in a lecturing tone: "If this sounds like preaching, it is also your own Bible's doctrine."

It is revealed that Dulles ordered the governments of the seven Western European countries to have a "definite expression" on the "European Army" treaty by the beginning of April at the latest, and to report to Washington separately in March and April. However, no matter how stern the U.S. special envoy was, his European tour was definitely fruitless. United Press International issued a dispatch from Luxembourg on the 8th, when Dulles left for home, stating: "Despite optimistic official statements from European governments, he (Dulles) has not received any definite guarantees from any government regarding the ratification of the stalled European Army agreement or its reactivation by any definite date."

    遭受一系列失败后
    杜勒斯等离开西欧回美国
    【新华社十日讯】美国国务卿杜勒斯和“共同安全署”署长史塔生已结束他们的不顺利的欧洲巡视，在八日离欧返美。他们在六日离开西德波恩后，又先后到荷兰、比利时、卢森堡，继续他们在巴黎、伦敦等地已经一再遭遇失败的使命。当他们八日从卢森堡开始他们的归程时，他们带了西欧仆从国家的一大堆要求，但在督导“西欧统一”的任务上，没有得到任何确切的进展。
    据合众社消息，杜勒斯到达荷兰首都海牙以后，荷兰政府首脑就向他诉苦说：荷兰最近发生了大水灾，造成的损失大约相等于荷兰今年为北大西洋集团的扩军计划拨出的钱数，因此今年荷兰将不能完成它所承担的扩军“义务”。他们还告诉杜勒斯说，荷兰因此可能还要“美元援助”。荷兰政府表示它“重视”“西欧统一”计划，但同时强调对美国“高度的贸易障碍”的不满。
    在比利时首都布鲁塞尔，杜勒斯得到的回答是：比利时要它的邻国法国和西德先切实承担起“欧洲军”条约的义务，然后才愿意把它的几师军队拿出来。比利时政府的首脑们请杜勒斯注意，比利时政府在延长兵役问题上曾经受到比利时人民的激烈反抗，造成政治危机。他们告诉杜勒斯，如果现在贸然批准“欧洲军”条约，比利时政府会陷入“同样的如果不是危险至少也是难堪的境地”。据合众社说，比利时政府“像其他欧洲防务集团国家一样”，要求得到“大批以美元购买的军事装备”和美元军事订货。
    在卢森堡，杜勒斯向正在开会的西欧煤钢联营机构的会议讲话，再一次重复他的要挟言词，他说，对美国的“统一欧洲”的“事业”，“欧洲必须作出重要贡献”。杜勒斯在重复他的谰调时，用教训的口气说：“假使这听起来好像讲道一样的话，这也是你们自己圣经中的道理”。
    据透露，杜勒斯曾勒令西欧七国政府最迟在四月初必须就“欧洲军”条约有“确切表示”，并在三四月间分别向华盛顿呈报。但是不管这位美国的钦差大臣如何横眉竖目，他的欧洲巡行是确定地没有结果。合众社八日在杜勒斯动身回国时从卢森堡发出电讯说：“尽管欧洲各国政府官方表示乐观，但他（杜勒斯）并没有从任何一国政府得到关于在任何确定的日期以前批准受到阻碍的欧洲军协定或是使之重新活动起来的确切保证。”
