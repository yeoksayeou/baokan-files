Editor's Note: Henan Daily has recently published a series of articles deeply exposing and criticizing the Lushan County leadership's fabrication of the Wen Xianglan Agricultural Production Cooperative's bumper harvest results. On January 15th, the Henan Provincial People's Government issued an order designating the units involved in this matter, such as the Henan Provincial People's Government's Department of Agriculture and Forestry, Xuchang Prefecture Office, Lushan County People's Government, and relevant personnel, to conduct public self-criticism. This approach is entirely correct. Although the facts of the Lushan County leadership's false reporting of bumper harvest results are not very common nationwide, they are by no means isolated. Leaders at all levels, rural work cadres, and model workers should boldly expose these facts and wage a serious struggle against bad practices such as making false reports, exaggerating work achievements, reporting only the good news and not the bad, and being irresponsible in their work.

In the summer of 1952, during the wheat harvest, Comrade Lü Jianzhong, a reporter from the Yangtze River Daily, and I came to Lushan. The responsible comrade of the county party committee said that the three mu of wheat fields of the Wen Xianglan Agricultural Production Cooperative in Hetang Township, Third District, had achieved a high yield of 676 jin per mu. We then went to Hetang Township together with Chang Yaozhong from the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government and Li Dapu from the Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry, who were investigating wheat production in the county. According to our understanding, the cooperative's high-yield wheat fields were divided into two plots, one of 0.7 mu belonging to cooperative chairman Wen Xianglan and one of 2.3 mu belonging to cooperative member Zhang Fuxing. The cooperative was organized after the spring plowing of 1952, and the wheat field cultivation and processing were the responsibility of each household. We decided to understand and summarize their high-yield experience household by household. High-yield household Zhang Fuxing said that his plot of land was a total of four mu, and the cultivation and fertilization had been the same every year, resulting in a good harvest every year. In 1951, the average wheat yield was over 630 old jin per mu. In 1952, 2.3 mu were selected as high-yield land, and the remaining one mu or so was estimated to have a yield no lower than this.

The next morning, we went to his high-yield field to observe. It was a relatively poor hilly land, considered to be seventh-grade land locally. The section they selected as high-yield land had no clear boundary in the middle of the field. When we asked the chairman, vice-chairman, and the landowner, they were also unclear about where the boundary of the high-yield land was. At that time, the wheat field had just been threshed, and the stubble of the adjacent fields had not been plowed, but the stubble of the "high-yield land" had been plowed away. According to general principles, in the same hilly area, if the artificial conditions are the same, the crops in the lower areas will definitely be stronger than those in the higher areas due to rainwater erosion and fertilizer accumulation. Therefore, we measured the number of plants based on the wheat stubble in the lower end (outside the "high-yield land" area). After two measurements, one was 28 plants per square foot, and the other was 31 plants per square foot. The adjacent five-fen eight-li (which we measured ourselves) ginger stubble wheat of farmer Zhang Zhizhu had 51 plants per square foot according to the measurement results. Zhang Zhizhu's wife, who was hoeing wheat stubble in the field, told us that the wheat in Zhang Fuxing's field did not grow as well as her family's, and her five-fen eight-li of land only yielded one dou (equivalent to 100 jin).

Next, we individually interviewed more than a dozen farmers. They only generally knew that the Wen Xianglan Agricultural Production Cooperative harvested 2,030 jin of wheat from three mu in 1952, but they did not know where the high-yield land was. We roughly investigated the wheat harvest in the village in 1952. It was said that because of the continuous rainy weather during the wheat flowering period, the harvest was generally not as good as in 1951, and an average of 100 jin per mu was considered a good harvest. If the high-yield land of the Wen Xianglan Agricultural Production Cooperative really averaged more than 670 jin per mu, that is to say, the yield was more than five and a half times higher than that of ordinary wheat land, then many farmers would have gone to his wheat field to see it before the harvest. But why was it that the local people at the time were unclear about where the high-yield land was?

On the afternoon of the 12th, we analyzed the above-mentioned questionable points. Li Dapu personally went to the district government and conducted research with the local leaders, and reported to the county by telephone. The district government immediately sent two cadres to the township, and Jiao, the section chief of the county government's Agriculture and Forestry Section, also rushed over at the same time. We then worked with them to see Wen Xianglan's field. The land had not yet been plowed, and the wheat stubble was much denser than Zhang Fuxing's land, and the terrain was very flat, and it was melon stubble (Note: Planting wheat after melon stubble is considered good stubble locally). We began to carefully measure the number of plants. During the measurement, we generally chose densely populated areas, and the measurement was carried out with the consent of Wen Xianglan herself (she was also present at the time). We calculated a total of four small blocks, each with an area of ​​nine square feet. The calculation result was 243,000 plants per mu. According to the average of 35 grains per spike and the weight of 1,000 grains being one liang, the yield per mu would be 531 jin. But this is obviously an inflated figure. Because: First, the calculation of the number of plants is based on dense areas as the standard, and the actual number of plants per mu will definitely not be 243,000; Second, the weight of 1,000 grains of wheat was weighed by Li Dapu and was actually only eight qian, and it was changed to one liang for the convenience of calculation; Third, the number of grains per spike is based on only ten or so wheat spikes reserved by the cooperative as specimens, and the stems are thicker than most of the wheat stubble in the "high-yield land", and the average number of grains per spike in the field will definitely not be 35. It can be concluded that the actual yield will not exceed 400 jin at most.

As time went by, the impression in my mind gradually faded. But suddenly, on October 28th, I saw the name of the Wen Xianglan Agricultural Production Cooperative in the "Henan Provincial People's Government Announces the Fourth Batch of Award-Winning Models for High Wheat Yield in 1952" published in the Henan Daily.

Why was it awarded? I immediately went to the Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry to ask. The answer I got was: Because the local county and district leaders insisted that it was a "real high yield," and they absolutely guaranteed it and took responsibility. At the time, I was extremely hesitant, could it be that they really found absolutely verifiable materials? However, when I reviewed the field investigation records at that time, I quickly came to the conclusion: The so-called "insistence" and "guarantee" were nothing more than self-deception. Because, judging from the output, the figures we investigated and estimated were only higher, not lower, and the actual output would definitely not reach the high-yield standard.

So why did the local leaders make a "absolutely true" guarantee? This may be because Wen Xianglan is a young female League member, and she is active in production, study, and work on weekdays. The leaders want to improve her prestige through high-yield awards and make her a banner among young women; or it is simply to take care of the emotions of the model, and insist on "turning falsehood into truth." If this is really the case, then someone will ask: Can we use any means to deceive the masses in order to cultivate and establish a banner? Can we ignore the feelings of local farmers in order to take care of the emotions of the labor model?

The nature of the facts is extremely serious. In order to restore the adverse effects caused by this incident to the Party and the People's Government among the masses, in order to correctly encourage and promote the patriotic enthusiasm of farmers for high yields, and in order to educate cadres at all levels who are engaged in rural production work, I suggest:

First, the Henan Provincial People's Government should seriously and solemnly handle this matter: take back the high-yield awards given to the Wen Xianglan Agricultural Production Cooperative, order the local county and district leading organs to investigate responsibility, and conduct public self-criticism. Cadres who actively helped to fabricate false high yields in the township during the wheat harvest should be punished according to the severity of the circumstances.

Second, it is recommended that the Party newspaper organize a discussion on this issue to achieve the purpose of widely educating the masses.

    鲁山县文香兰农业生产合作社小麦“高额丰产”的实况调查
    阚枫
    编者按：河南日报最近连续发表了许多文章，对河南省鲁山县领导机关捏造文香兰农业生产合作社的丰产成绩的事件，进行了深入的揭发和批评；一月十五日河南省人民政府并发布命令，指定与这件事情有关的单位，如河南省人民政府农林厅、许昌专署、鲁山县人民政府，以及有关的人员，进行公开的检讨。这种作法是完全正确的。像鲁山县领导机关假报丰产成绩的事实，在全国说来虽然并不是很普遍的，但决不是个别的。各地领导机关、农村工作干部、劳动模范应大胆揭发这些事实，向作假报告、夸大工作成绩、报喜不报忧、对工作不负责任等恶劣作风进行严肃的斗争。一九五二年夏天，正在麦收的时候，我和长江日报社记者吕建中同志一起来到鲁山。该县县委负责同志说：三区贺堂乡文香兰农业生产合作社的三亩麦田获得了每亩六百七十六斤的高额产量。我们便和正在该县调查小麦丰产情况的中央人民政府农业部常耀中、省府农林厅栗大普等一起赶往贺堂乡。据我们了解，该社丰产麦田共分两块，一是社长文香兰的七分，一是社员张福星的二亩三分。该社是一九五二年春耕以后组织起来的，麦田栽培与加工都是各户负责进行，我们决定逐户了解、总结他们的丰产经验。丰产户张福星说，他那块地共四亩，历年加工施肥都是一样，年年都得丰收，一九五一年每亩小麦平均收老秤六百三十多斤。一九五二年从中抽出了二亩三分作丰产地，其余一亩多估计产量也不会低于此数。
    第二天清早，我们便到他的丰产田里去观察。那是一块比较坏的丘陵地，在当地说来是七等地。他们抽作丰产地的那段，在地当中没有显明的边界。问正、副社长和地户，他们也弄不清丰产地的边界究竟在那里。那时，刚打完了麦场，邻近地的麦茬都未翻犁，偏偏就是“丰产地”麦茬被犁掉了。按一般道理讲，在同一块丘陵地内，如果人为条件相同，由于雨水冲刷，肥料流聚低处，低地庄稼定比高地强。因此，我们便在地势较低的一端（非“丰产地”范围），依据麦茬测定株数。经两次测量，一为每平方尺二十八株，一为每平方尺三十一株。而与该地接壤的农民张治柱的五分八厘（是我们亲自丈量的）姜茬小麦，经测量结果每平方尺五十一株。正在地里铲麦茬的张治柱的老婆对我们说，张福星地里的麦子长得并不如她家的好，而她的五分八厘地只打了一斗（合一百斤）。
    接着，我们又个别访问了十多个农民。他们都只是笼统地知道文香兰农业生产合作社一九五二年三亩小麦打了二千零三十斤，但却不知道丰产地究竟在那里。我们粗略地调查了一九五二年该村的小麦收成情况，据说因为小麦扬花期间，阴雨连绵，收成普遍不如一九五一年，每亩平均一百斤就算丰收了。如果文香兰农业生产合作社的丰产地真的每亩平均六百七十斤以上，那就是说比一般麦地产量高出五倍半还多，那么一定不要等到收获的时候，就会有很多农民跑到他的麦田里去看。但为甚么当时当地的情况却是本村群众弄不清丰产地在那里呢？
    十二日下午，我们针对以上若干可疑之点进行了分析。栗大普亲自跑到区政府与当地领导干部进行了研究，并从电话上向县里作了汇报。区政府立即派了两个干部来到该乡，县府农林科焦科长也同时赶来。我们便协同他们一起去看文香兰的那块地。这地尚未翻犁，麦茬比张福星的地稠得多，而且地势很平整，又是瓜茬（按：瓜茬种麦在当地是好茬子）。我们开始认真地测定株数，测定时一般都是选择麦茬稠密的地方，而且经过文香兰本人同意（当时她也在场）后才做。我们共计算了四小块，面积都是九平方尺。计算结果每亩为二十四万三千株。按每穗平均三十五粒，每千粒重一市两算，每亩为五百三十一市斤。但这显然是一个已经扩大了的数字。因为：第一、计算株数是以稠密的地方作标准，实际株数每亩绝对不会有二十四万三千株；第二、千粒麦子的重量经栗大普秤过，实际只八钱，为了计算方便才改作一两；第三、每穗粒数是以该社留作标本的仅有的十多个麦穗为准，秆子比“丰产地”的绝大部分麦茬都粗，大田麦穗绝不会平均三十五粒。由此可以断定实际产量最多不会超过四百斤。
    日子过的久了，脑海里的印象逐渐淡漠了。但突然在十月二十八日的河南日报发表的“河南省人民政府公布一九五二年小麦丰产模范第四批受奖名单”内看到了文香兰农业生产合作社的名字。
    究竟为什么给奖呢？我马上去问省府农林厅。得到的回答是：因为当地县区领导干部坚持是“真丰产”，他们绝对负责任保证。当时，我曾极度犹豫，莫非真的发现了可以绝对证实的材料了吗？但是，当我重新温习了当时的实况调查记录以后，很快就得出了结论：所谓“坚持”、“保证”，也不过是自欺欺人的说法罢了。因为，从产量上看，我们调查推算的数字，只高不低，实产量肯定不会达到高额丰产标准。
    那么究竟为什么当地领导干部会提出“绝对真实”的保证来呢？这可能因为文香兰是一个女青年团员，平日生产、学习、工作都积极，领导上要想通过丰产奖励，来提高她的威信，成为青年妇女中的旗帜；或者是单纯为了照顾模范的情绪，竟坚持要“弄假成真”。如果真的是这样，那么就要有人问：为了培养树立旗帜难道可以这样不择手段地去欺骗群众吗？为了照顾劳动模范的情绪难道可以不去照顾当地农民的情绪吗？
    事实的性质异常严重。为了挽回党和人民政府在群众中因此造成的不良影响，为了正确鼓舞与发扬农民的爱国丰产热情，为了教育各地领导农村生产工作的干部，我建议：
    第一、河南省人民政府应当认真严肃地处理这件事情：收回给予文香兰农业生产合作社的高额丰产奖品，命令当地县、区领导机关追查责任，并进行公开检讨。对于麦收期间在该乡主动帮助制造假高额丰产的干部根据情节轻重给以处分。
    第二、建议党报就此问题组织讨论，以达到广泛教育群众的目的。
