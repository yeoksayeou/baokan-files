Xinhua News Agency, February 22nd: The U.S. aggressors’ long-term, planned, and inhumane large-scale germ warfare in Korea has long been confirmed by various international investigation groups, especially the reports of the International Scientific Commission, as well as the confessions of captured U.S. personnel. Now, two captured senior officers of the U.S. Marine Corps First Air Wing have further confirmed that the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff planned and instructed the U.S. forces in the Far East to conduct germ warfare.

Colonel Wilbur, Chief of Staff of the U.S. Marine Corps First Air Wing, and Major Bray, Ordnance Officer of the U.S. Marine Corps First Air Wing, were captured on July 8, 1952, when their plane was shot down by ground fire from the Korean-Chinese People's Forces. After being captured, Wilbur and Bray were moved by the lenient policy of the Korean-Chinese People's Forces and have successively confessed to the fact that the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff issued instructions to General Ridgway, then Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Far East Command, in October 1951, ordering the large-scale implementation of germ warfare according to plan, as well as the various meeting contents of the U.S. Marine Corps First Air Wing regarding the specific deployment of germ warfare and its logistical support. In their confessions, Wilbur and Bray confessed that in carrying out this heinous crime, the U.S. side, fearing the solemn condemnation of just people around the world, especially emphasized various deceptive and punitive confidentiality measures, even emphasizing that the purpose of their confidentiality measures was "more importantly to prevent our own people from knowing."

    被俘美海军陆战队空军高级军官的供词
    彻底揭露美国进行细菌战
    【新华社二十二日讯】美国侵略者长期以来按照预定计划灭绝人性地在朝鲜大规模进行细菌战的滔天罪行，久已为各种国际调查团体，特别是国际科学委员会的报告以及美方被俘人员的供词所证实。现在，两名被俘的美国海军陆战队第一空军联队的高级军官更进一步地证实了美国参谋长联席会议计划并指示远东美军进行细菌战。
    美国海军陆战队第一空军联队参谋长上校许威布尔及美国海军陆战队第一空军联队军械官少校布莱所乘飞机于一九五二年七月八日被朝中人民部队地面炮火击落，二人同时被俘。被俘之后许威布尔及布莱二人在朝中人民部队宽大政策的感动之下，已先后分别供出美国参谋长联席会议在一九五一年十月向当时的美国远东司令部总司令李奇微发出指示，命令按照计划大规模进行细菌战的事实以及由此而来的美国海军陆战队第一空军联队关于具体部署细菌战及其后勤供应的各种会议内容。许威布尔及布莱二人在其供词中供出美方在进行这一恶毒罪行时，为了害怕全世界正义人类的严正指责，特别着重各种欺骗性的与惩罚性的保密措施，甚至强调他们的这种保密措施的目的“更重要的是避免使我们自己的人知道”。
