Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 3rd: The latest issue of "News" magazine published an article by Yuri Brov commenting on the situation in the new world market. Brov said: The relations between countries in the new world market are new relations based on equality, cooperation, and respect for national independence. There is no life-and-death competition or tariff war between them. On the contrary, this new market is full of an atmosphere of cooperation, mutual trust, and mutual assistance. Very abundant natural resources can fully meet the needs of the increasingly prosperous economies of the countries in this market. Expanding foreign trade is a characteristic of every country in the new world market, and the total volume of foreign trade in this market increased more than threefold between 1948 and 1952.

In 1952, 80 percent of the Soviet Union's foreign trade was conducted with people's democratic countries. In 1951, trade with the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries accounted for 92 percent of Bulgaria's total foreign trade; Romania accounted for 79 percent; Hungary accounted for 67 percent; Czechoslovakia accounted for 60 percent; and Albania accounted for 100 percent. In 1952, the total volume of Soviet trade with people's democratic countries increased by 22 percent compared with 1951.

In China's foreign trade volume in 1950, trade with the Soviet Union and people's democratic countries accounted for 26 percent. In 1951, it accounted for 61 percent, and last year it accounted for about 70 percent. The trade relations of the German Democratic Republic have also expanded similarly.

Brov then pointed out: Soviet loans are an important form of economic cooperation with people's democratic countries, especially long-term loans for purchasing Soviet-made industrial equipment and machinery. These items play a significant role in the industrialization plans of these countries. Taking Romania as an example, although Romania has abundant natural resources, it could previously only produce 1 percent of the machinery it needed, and the remaining 99 percent had to be imported from abroad. Today, Romania is developing its own machine-building industry. At the end of 1951, the production of means of production accounted for 54.4 percent of the country's total industrial production. This level has been achieved to a large extent due to the massive Soviet technical assistance.

Brov also said: Mutual assistance in science and technology is also an important form of economic cooperation between the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. The Soviet Union allows people's democratic countries to use Soviet patents, licenses, and production technologies, blueprints, etc. free of charge, helping them to start manufacturing the latest types of machinery and equipment. For example, Poland has used Soviet technology for coal mining combines, freight cars, and automobile models; Romania has used Soviet technology for drilling equipment, harvesting combines, and other agricultural machinery; Czechoslovakia has used Soviet technology for huge power units and particularly powerful molding machines, and so on.

Brov concluded by saying: Artificially isolating the "Western" market from the "Eastern" market does no harm to the new world market. On the contrary, it has the opposite effect on the capitalist world market. For the benefit of the Western economy, it is necessary to restore normal, multi-faceted trade and economic ties, especially trade and economic ties with the countries of the democratic camp.

### 民主世界市场贸易总额五年增加两倍多

    民主世界市场贸易总额五年增加两倍多
    【新华社三日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科一日讯：最近一期“新闻”杂志刊载了尤里·布罗夫评论新世界市场情况的文章。布罗夫说：新世界市场各国间的关系是建立在平等、合作和尊重民族独立的基础上的崭新关系。它们之间根本没有你死我活的竞争和关税战。相反的，这个新市场上充满了合作、互信和互助的气氛。非常丰富的自然资源可以充分满足这个市场上各国的日益繁荣的经济的需要。扩大对外贸易是新世界市场中每个国家的特点，这个市场的对外贸易总额在一九四八年到一九五二年间增加了两倍多。
    在一九五二年，苏联对外贸易中有百分之八十是与人民民主国家进行的。保加利亚一九五一年对苏联及其他人民民主国家的贸易占全部对外贸易的百分之九十二；罗马尼亚占百分之七十九；匈牙利占百分之六十七；捷克斯洛伐克占百分之六十；阿尔巴尼亚占百分之一百。一九五二年苏联对人民民主国家的贸易总额比一九五一年增加了百分之二十二。
    在中国一九五○年的对外贸易额中，对苏联和人民民主国家的贸易额占百分之二十六。一九五一年中占百分之六十一，去年占百分之七十左右。德意志民主共和国的贸易关系也同样扩大了。
    布罗夫接着指出：苏联的贷款是和人民民主国家的经济合作的一种重要方式，特别是为购买苏联制造的工业设备和机器给予的长期贷款。这些物品在这些国家的工业化计划中所起的作用是不小的。以罗马尼亚为例，尽管罗马尼亚有着丰富的天然富源，然而它从前只能生产它所需要的机器的百分之一，余下的百分之九十九都必须由国外输入。而今天，罗马尼亚正在发展它自己的机器制造工业。在一九五一年底，生产资料的生产已占全国工业生产的百分之五十四点四了。这个水平在很大程度上是由于苏联大量的技术援助才能达到的。
    布罗夫又说：科学和技术方面的互助也是苏联和人民民主国家的经济合作的一种重要方式。苏联准许人民民主国家免费利用苏联的专利权、特许证和生产技术、蓝图等等，帮助它们开始制造最新型的机器和设备。例如，波兰就利用了苏联采煤联合机、货车和汽车模型的技术；罗马尼亚利用了苏联钻探设备、收割联合机以及其他农业机器的技术；捷克斯洛伐克利用了苏联巨大的动力装置、效力特别强大的压型机的技术等等。
    布罗夫最后说：将“西方”市场和“东方”市场人为地隔绝起来，对新的世界市场毫无损害可言。相反地，它对资本主义世界市场却有着相反的效果。为了西方经济的利益，必须恢复正常的、多方面的贸易和经济联系，特别是与民主阵营国家的贸易和经济联系。
