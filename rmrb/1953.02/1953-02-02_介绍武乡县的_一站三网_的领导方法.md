    Introducing the "One Station, Three Networks" Leadership Method in Wuxiang County
    Ke Lin
    As the countryside fully enters into large-scale production, many new issues in leadership deserve attention and study – how to effectively promote advanced production experiences to strive for large-area high yields? How to organize scattered rural areas to carry out sustainable production competition movements? How to enable backward villages to catch up with advanced villages, and to achieve balanced development of all villages? The "One Station, Three Networks" leadership method in Wuxiang County has begun to offer the possibility of solving this series of problems.

    Dividing a district into several base points, with district cadres assigned responsibilities and relying on these base points to drive the general work, is a common leadership method adopted in various rural areas. However, how to regularly and systematically promote advanced experiences to strive for balanced development of work has not been well resolved in many areas. In the past, the leadership of Wuxiang County over base points also had many problems: First, some district cadres were stuck in their base points, and experiences could not get out of the village to promote the overall work; second, some cadres were running around all day, randomly visiting villages, expending effort but not doing good work; third, the selection of some base point villages was mainly based on their central location, and advanced production villages were not necessarily selected as base point villages. During the production movement in 1952, local rural work leaders more deeply felt the impact of this contradiction between point and area on production work. Therefore, starting in the spring, they began to pilot the "One Station, Three Networks" leadership method.

    "One Station, Three Networks" means taking a village with relatively good production as a station, and connecting a surrounding area of villages through a production competition network (including mutual aid and cooperation), a technology promotion network, and a Party propaganda network, to drive the backward with the advanced, and to promote the general with the typical, so that the production movement can unfold from point to area, in order to strive for balanced development of work and achieve universal high yields.

    Each of the "Three Networks" has its own organizational system and work content. Their main methods of operation are through various representative meetings, observation and evaluation, and visits and inspections, in order to coordinate with each other, disseminate experience, and advance the production movement. Here, let’s take the activity of the Yaoshanggou "One Station, Three Networks" as an example.

    The Yaoshanggou Station includes five villages: Yaoshanggou, Hanbi, Houjianao, Nan Shanghe, and Bei Shanghe. The farthest distance between the villages is eight li. The "One Station, Three Networks" leadership method began to be piloted here last spring. Their
    activity content of the "Three Networks" is as follows:

    The Production Competition Network (here called the Mutual Aid and Cooperation Network) takes the Yaoshanggou Agricultural Production Cooperative as the center, with Wang Jinyun, the director of the cooperative, as the person in charge of this network. It connects active elements in the mutual aid and cooperation organizations of the surrounding four villages, promotes production competition, and disseminates mutual aid experience through the form of mutual aid representative meetings. From the formulation of the production competition plan in the spring to the inspection and evaluation in each season, a series of activities were carried out. In addition to the three major evaluations and observations in spring, summer, and autumn, mutual aid team leaders and village cadres from various villages also frequently visited Yaoshanggou. Important meetings of the Wang Jinyun Agricultural Production Cooperative systematically included representatives of mutual aid teams from the four villages. The role of this practical demonstration is significant. Last spring, the mutual aid teams in various villages learned from the experience of Wang Jinyun's cooperative and rectified their own teams. Many teams changed from temporary teams to long-term teams, small teams merged into large teams, and new farm tools were purchased collectively. After the summer harvest, agricultural production cooperatives had been established in the villages of Bei Shanghe and Houjianao. When Bei Shanghe established its agricultural production cooperative, Wang Jinyun personally went to the village to help solve the problem of land evaluation for the new cooperative members.

    The work of the Technology Promotion Network is directly guided by the county-run farm. Shi Fusheng and Zheng Yueming, the technical instructors of the Yaoshanggou Agricultural Production Cooperative, are responsible for this network. Each village has a technical committee, and each mutual aid team has a technician. The technology network relies on these technical organizations or technicians to impart and promote new technologies. In addition to regularly holding joint meetings of technicians from various villages to exchange experiences, important technical activities of the Yaoshanggou Agricultural Production Cooperative also include inviting technicians from the four villages to visit. During the spring sowing, some villages could not grasp the soaking temperature of seeds, so they came to Yaoshanggou to learn the method of counting beans to measure time (as there are no watches in the countryside, counting 300 beans equals five minutes). When planting wheat, Shi Fusheng also went to several nearby villages to explain the benefits of close planting and methods to reduce row spacing, increase sowing width, and increase the amount of sowing. The technology network systematically organized observations and instruction on important technical activities such as spring sowing, thinning, plowing and harrowing, and fertilization. Each village had at least twenty such visits. Visitors sometimes also put forward technical improvement suggestions to advanced villages. Therefore, this kind of observation can play a role in exchanging experiences and improving technologies.

    The Party Propaganda Network is headed by Wang Laixiu, the propaganda member of the Yaoshanggou branch. It connects with various villages through methods such as propaganda network transmission stations and propaganda worker representative meetings. Sometimes, excellent propagandists from various villages are also invited to participate in meetings to deploy work and inspect work, and to exchange propaganda experiences. The frequent activities of the propaganda network are to promote the central tasks, dispel the ideological concerns of the masses, and improve the ideological awareness of the masses in various tasks. It uses propaganda tools such as blackboards, reading groups, broadcasting trumpets, and Q&A columns to carry out political propaganda and production propaganda. Wang Laixiu is an excellent propaganda talent who can compose quick rhymes. Some people call him "Li Youcai." When promoting the new-style plow this spring, he paid attention to studying the ideological concerns of the masses. Some people complained about the farm, saying that the new plow was "too heavy to carry, too heavy to hold, this is fooling the people!" The propaganda network cooperated with the technology network to organize more than one hundred people from five villages to visit Yaoshanggou to see the new plow耕地 (gēngdì -耕地), and inspected the depth on the spot, and discussed the benefits of the new plow. People in the propaganda network compiled the results of the discussion into a quick rhyme:

    "Carrying it's heavy, plowing it's light, plows deep, plows level, removes weeds, eliminates insects, more grain, guaranteed". This quick rhyme spread quickly, and the new plow sold quickly. The propaganda about the superiority of mutual aid and cooperation was even more frequent and in-depth. When Zheng Xueming's brothers in Yaoshanggou divided their family property, they dug a ditch in the middle of a six-mu (亩) plot of land. The ditch became larger and larger after rain, wasting land and labor, and the brothers often argued over the boundary. After they joined the agricultural production cooperative, the six mu of land was connected again, and the harvest exceeded any previous year, and the brothers reconciled. Wang Laixiu compiled this incident into a quick rhyme: "Land connected, hearts connected, more grain, more efficient, joining the agricultural cooperative, closer than our brothers." After propaganda in various villages, the saying "land connected, hearts connected" spread everywhere. People yearned for agricultural production cooperatives, and many mutual aid teams were preparing for the conditions to establish one. The activities of the propaganda network have essentially become the political soul of the above two networks.

    Under the promotion of the "One Station, Three Networks," the work of several villages in this base point has improved significantly in the past year. Bei Shanghe was a relatively backward village the year before last. Last year, it established an agricultural production cooperative, and the appearance of various tasks was brand new. Du Fayun, the party branch secretary of the village, said: "Having a good neighbor makes work really smooth." He said that although he was only two or three li from Yaoshanggou in the past, they did not interact with each other, and each did his own thing. Now everyone is in close contact, and the advantages of each family can be exchanged, which is a really good method. The district cadres who are stationed here also said: "Mastering the 'One Station, Three Networks' grasps all the important links in rural production, saves cadres, has a great effect, and work is easier to promote than in the past."

    Experience proves that: (1) The "One Station, Three Networks" leadership method has organized all the active elements in the countryside who can drive production.

    The "One Station, Three Networks" leadership method liberates district cadres from the leadership methods of either sticking to base points or running around, so it is possible to concentrate attention on "new things" and on the problems of backward villages. (2) Using the "One Station, Three Networks" leadership method, district cadres must pay attention to the situation of each village in the entire base point, take the time to face backwardness, and study and solve the problems of backward villages. In last year's production movement, the work of some villages was promoted by using the power of the "network," but the work of some villages has not improved enough. For example, in Hanbi Village of Yaoshanggou Station, because the party branch committee members are not united, they do not accept advanced experience as well as other villages. Therefore, if district cadres are only confused by the achievements of the "One Station, Three Networks" and do not pay attention to solving the internal problems of such villages, advanced experience will be difficult to promote, the problem of balanced work will not be solved, and the "One Station, Three Networks" will easily become a formality here. (3)

    The leadership of the "Three Networks" has not increased the number of institutions, but has simply expanded the activities of one village to several villages in the form of representative joint meetings or visits. However, this kind of connection must be determined according to work needs, and cannot be excessive. Excessive activities that disregard actual needs or do not solve any problems will instead cause losses to the work.

    This new leadership method is only beginning to be piloted in Wuxiang, and has not yet been consciously grasped by the cadres of the entire county. Although there are already thirty-two stations in the county, there are not many that truly comprehensively use the "Three Networks" to promote work. Some have good technology promotion networks, but the dissemination of mutual aid and cooperation experience is very poor; some have production competition network activities, but other effects are not great. However, judging from the situation of each station, as long as there is one "network" carrying out activities, there will be certain progress in that task.

    介绍武乡县的“一站三网”的领导方法
    克林
    在农村全力进入大生产后，领导方面遇到许多新的问题值得注意研究——如何有效地推广先进生产经验，以便争取大面积的丰产？怎样把分散的农村组织起来，开展能持续进行的生产竞赛运动？如何才能使落后村赶上先进村，使所有村庄平衡发展？武乡县“一站三网”的领导方法，开始提供了解决这一系列问题的可能性。
    把一个区划分成几个基点，区干部分工负责，依托基点推动一般，这是各地农村普遍采用的领导方法。但如何经常而系统地推广先进经验，以争取工作平衡发展，不少地区都未很好地加以解决。武乡县过去对基点的领导也存在不少问题：一是有些区干部死守基点，经验出不了村，不能推动全面；二是有些干部成天跑腿，各村乱串，费力而又作不好工作；三是有些基点村的选择，只以位置居中为主要条件，生产先进村不一定被选为基点村。在一九五二年的生产运动中，当地农村工作领导者更深刻地感到这种点面矛盾对生产工作的影响，因此，他们从春天起就开始试行了“一站三网”的领导方法。
    “一站三网”就是以一个生产较好的村为站，通过生产竞赛网（包括互助合作）、技术推广网、党的宣传网，把周围一片村庄都联系起来，以先进带动落后，以典型推动一般，使生产运动由点到面地展开，以争取工作的平衡发展，达到普遍丰产的目的。
    “三网”各有其组织系统和工作内容。它们的活动方法主要是通过各种代表会议、观摩评比、访问检查，以便互相配合，传播经验，推进生产运动。这里举窑上沟“一站三网”的活动情况为例。
    窑上沟站包括窑上沟、韩壁、侯家垴、南上河、北上河等五个村，各村相距最远为八里。去年春季开始试行“一站三网”的领导方法。他们这里的
    “三网”的活动内容是这样的：
    生产竞赛网（这里叫互助合作网）以窑上沟农业生产合作社为中心，社长王锦云为这个网的负责人。它联系周围四村互助合作组织中的积极分子，通过互助代表会议形式，推动生产竞赛，传播互助经验。从春季制订生产竞赛计划到每个季节的检查评比，进行了一系列的活动。除春夏秋三次大的评比观摩外，各村互助组长和村干部还经常到窑上沟参观访问。王锦云农业生产合作社的重要会议，都有计划地吸收四个村的互助代表参加。这种实例示范的作用是很大的。去年春天，各村互助组学了王锦云社的经验，都整顿了自己的组，不少组由临时组变为长期组，由小组合并为大组，还伙买了新农具。夏收后，北上河、侯家垴两村已成立起农业生产合作社。北上河建立农业生产合作社时，王锦云还亲到该村帮助解决新社员的土地评产问题。
    技术推广网的工作，直接受县国营农场的指导。窑上沟农业生产合作社的技术指导员史富生、郑月明为这个网的负责人。各村都有技术委员会，各互助组都设有技术员。技术网就依托这些技术组织或技术员，传授推广新技术。除定期举行各村技术员的联席会议交流经验外，窑上沟农业生产合作社的重要技术活动，也吸收四个村的技术员来参观。春播时有些村掌握不了浸种温度，就来窑上沟学习了数豆计时（农村没表，数三百豆顶五分钟）的办法。种麦时史富生还到附近几村讲解密植好处，和缩小行距、加大播幅、增加播种量的办法。春播、间苗、耕耙、施肥等重要技术活动，技术网都有计划地组织了观摩传授。这种观摩每村至少在二十次以上。参观者有时也向先进村提出技术上的改进意见，因此，这种观摩能发挥交流经验改进技术的作用。
    党的宣传网以窑上沟支部宣传委员王来秀为负责人。它通过宣传网传授站与宣传员代表会议等方式和各村联系。有时也吸收各村优秀的宣传员参加布置工作检查工作的会议，交流宣传经验。宣传网经常的活动是推动中心工作，解除群众思想顾虑，在各种工作上提高群众的思想觉悟。它通过黑板报、读报组、广播筒、问答栏等宣传工具，来进行政治宣传和生产宣传。王来秀是一个出色的宣传人材，会编快板，有人叫他是“李有才”。今春推广新式步犁时，他注意研究了群众的思想顾虑。有些群众埋怨农场，说新犁“拿不动，扛不动，这是胡弄老百姓”！宣传网就和技术网配合，组织了五个村
    一百多人来窑上沟参观新犁耕地，当场验看深度，讨论新犁好处。宣传网的人把讨论结果编成快板：
    “扛着重，犁着轻，耕的深，耕的平，又去草，又除虫，多打粮，有保证”。这个快板传的很快，新犁销的也很快。关于互助合作的优越性的宣传更为经常和深入。窑上沟郑雪明弟兄在分家时，在一块六亩大的整块地中间划了一道沟。这道沟下雨过水越冲越大，浪费土地人工，弟兄还常为地界闹气。他们参加农业生产合作社后，六亩地又联成一块，收成超过以往任何一年，弟兄也和好了。王来秀就把这件事编成快板：“土地连片人连心，多打粮食又赶工，加入农业合作社，比咱弟兄还要亲”。经过各村宣传，“土地连片人连心”的说法到处传颂，人们向往着农业生产合作社，不少互助组都准备建社条件。宣传网的活动，实质上成为以上两个网的政治灵魂。
    在“一站三网”的推动下，一年以来，这个基点几个村的工作都有显著的提高。北上河前年还是个比较落后的村子，去年成立了农业生产合作社，各种工作面貌一新。该村支部书记杜法云说：“搭个好邻居，工作真顺利”，他说，过去离窑上沟虽只两三里，可是互不来往，各干各的。现在大家联系密切，谁家的好处都能互相交流，这办法真不错。常驻这里工作的区干部也说：掌握“一站三网”，把农村生产中的重要环节都抓起来了，既省干部，作用又大，工作比过去好推动多了。
    经验证明：（一）“一站三网”的领导方法，把农村中能带动生产的积极分子全部组织起来了。
    “一站三网”的领导方法使区干部从死守基点或跑腿主义的领导方法中解放出来，因此有可能把注意力集中到“新事物”上去，集中到落后村的问题上去。（二）运用“一站三网”的领导方法，区干部必须注意全基点各村的情况，抽出时间，面向落后，研究和解决落后村的问题。在去年的生产运动中，有些村的工作运用“网”的力量推动起来了，但也有些村的工作提高得还不够。如窑上沟站的韩壁村，因为党的支部委员们不团结，接受先进经验就不如别的村。因此，区干部如果只迷惑于“一站三网”的成就，而不注意解决这样村子的内部问题，先进经验就难推广，工作平衡的问题就无法解决，“一站三网”在这里也就容易流于形式。（三）
    “三网”的领导并未增多机构，只是把一个村的活动以代表联席会或参观等方式扩大到数村去。但这种联系必须根据工作需要而定，不能过多。不顾实际需要或不解决任何问题的过多的活动，反会造成工作的损失。
    这种新的领导方法在武乡也还只是开始试行，还没有为全县干部有意识地加以掌握。全县虽已有三十二个站，但真正全面运用“三网”推动工作的为数还不多。有的是技术推广网不错，互助合作经验传播很差；有的是生产竞赛网有活动，其他作用不大。但从各站情况看，只要有“一网”进行活动，该项工作就有一定进展。
