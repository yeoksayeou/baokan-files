Response to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions from the People's Daily

    Xin Yuanxi Writes a Letter: When I was the president of the Su'nan People's Bank, I indeed wrongly suppressed Comrade Zhang Mujun's criticism and attacked Comrade Zhang Mujun. After Comrade Zhang Mujun's criticism was published in the Jiefang Daily at the end of 1951, although we conducted a self-examination, we still harbored resentment. We instructed the bank's internal publications to criticize Zhang Mujun's ideology, and we also raised the requirement of "distinguishing right from wrong and increasing vigilance" to the section and division-level cadres within the bank. Under the influence of my erroneous thinking, the anti-corruption struggle in the General Affairs Section at that time became a struggle to attack critics, causing some leading cadres in the bank to resist mass criticism. I should bear the main responsibility for these mistakes.
    Last November, the East China Branch of the People's Bank instructed me to seriously examine this mistake of suppressing criticism. However, I still lacked the necessary understanding ideologically, delayed my response, and requested the Provincial People's Supervisory Committee and the Provincial Party Discipline Inspection Committee to "investigate the facts." It was not until I studied Comrade Malenkov's report and the documents related to the Huang Yifeng incident that I gained a relatively deep understanding of my mistakes. In addition to ensuring that I will correctly treat bottom-up criticism in the future, I also request the higher authorities to impose strict punishment.

    原苏南人民银行行长忻元锡来信检讨压制批评的错误
    忻元锡来信：我在任原苏南人民银行行长时对张牧军同志的批评的确曾经错误地加以压制并对张牧军同志加以打击。张牧军同志的批评稿在一九五一年底解放日报上发表以后，我们虽作了检查，但有不满情绪。我们曾指示在行内刊物上批判张牧军的思想，并曾对行内科、股长干部提出“辨别是非、提高警惕”的要求。在我的错误思想影响下，当时总务股内反贪污斗争一度成为打击批评者的斗争，使行内某些领导干部也对抗群众批评。这些错误，我应负主要责任。
    去年十一月，华东区人民银行曾责成我严肃检查这个压制批评的错误。但我思想上还缺乏应有的认识，迟迟不作答复，并请省人民监察委员会和省委纪律检查委员会来“查明事实”。直到学了马林科夫同志的报告和有关黄逸峰事件的文件后，我才比较深刻地认识了自己的错误。除了保证今后正确对待自下而上的批评外，并请求上级给予严格的处分。
