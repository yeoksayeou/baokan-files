American Investment in India Increases

Xinhua News Agency: According to a report from the New Delhi correspondent of the Pakistani "Today" newspaper, sources close to the American "Truman Point Four Program" office in India revealed that the United States is trying every means to strengthen its economic and political position in India. The correspondent pointed out that the American Embassy in New Delhi has established a special agency to manage the work of distributing so-called "aid" from the United States to India.

In 1951 and the first half of 1952, the United States greatly increased its investment in India's major economic sectors. New Jersey-New York Mobil Oil Company and Texas Oil Company have almost obtained exclusive rights to explore for oil and build refineries in India. Several American-Indian joint ventures have been established in Indian industry. These companies are engaged in building factories and excavating mines to extract and refine strategic materials for shipment to the United States. Several American companies own 51 percent of the shares in these American-Indian joint ventures.

The United States government is providing loans to Tata Iron and Steel Company and other large Indian companies, hoping to use this to control India's metallurgical industry.

The "Today" reporter also said that the goal of the United States' policy toward India is to drive out British influence in India.

The United States Intensifies Its Seizure of British Raw Material Bases

Xinhua News Agency: In the shrinking world market, Britain is desperately resisting its covetous American "friend" to maintain and defend its position in its colonial empire. The Southeast Asian colonies are of great significance to British monopoly capitalists, because they export extremely valuable raw materials such as tin and rubber from there and obtain huge profits.

The attempt by American monopoly enterprises to take advantage of Britain's economic and financial difficulties to seize British raw material bases has threatened these high profits of British monopoly enterprises.

The British weekly "World News and Views" recently published an article discussing the economic crisis in Malaya and American pressure, which cited many facts about the Anglo-American struggle for raw materials and markets in Southeast Asia.

The weekly pointed out that as early as 1947, American monopoly capitalists used Britain's lack of US dollars to demand that Britain supply the United States with certain important raw materials from Malaya and its other colonies.

The United States, a major buyer of rubber, used many measures, such as limiting the consumption of natural rubber by American industries and developing the production of synthetic rubber, to influence world rubber prices and inflict a fatal blow on the British and Dutch groups in the rubber market.

Tin is another of the most important raw materials exported from Malaya, and it is of great value to the United States. In 1948, the United States secured lower export taxes and began hoarding tin frantically. By 1950, it had acquired 78 percent of Malaya's total tin exports, paying prices that were much lower than the general prices on the world market.

Later, American monopoly enterprises used the notorious Marshall Plan as a weapon to launch an offensive against all raw material markets. The US House Appropriations Committee openly demanded that the United States should have equal rights to invest in the colonies of countries receiving Marshall Plan "aid," and that these colonies should supply raw materials to the United States on preferential terms.

The next stage of American expansion was to invade British territories under the pretext of implementing Truman's Point Four Program. The United States government's "aid" to underdeveloped regions was conditional on American investors having the right to participate in the management of various economic sectors in these regions.

The weekly pointed out that since the arrival of the American delegation headed by John Melby in Malaya in 1950, American intrusion into Malaya has intensified. At the same time, American private companies have also begun to become increasingly "interested" in Malaya's rubber plantations and tin mines.

The Americans are also using the industrial and financial power of Japan to strengthen their expansion in Malaya and other countries in Southeast Asia.

### 美英帝国主义在东南亚地区的矛盾加深

    美英帝国主义在东南亚地区的矛盾加深
    美国增加在印度的投资
    据新华社讯：巴基斯坦“今天报”驻德里记者报道，据接近美国在印度的“杜鲁门第四点计划”办事处的消息灵通人士透露：美国正在想尽办法加强它在印度的经济和政治地位。该记者指出：新德里美国大使馆已设立了一个特别机构，管理分配美国给印度的所谓“援助”的工作。
    在一九五一年和一九五二年的上半年，美国大大地增加了它在印度主要经济部门的投资。美国的新泽西—纽约美孚油公司和得克萨斯石油公司几乎已得到在印度开采石油和建造炼油厂的专有权利。印度的工业中已有好几个美国和印度合营的公司。这些公司进行建造工厂、开掘矿山，以采炼运往美国的战略物资。有几个美国公司拥有那些美印合营公司的股份的百分之五十一。
    美国政府正在贷款给塔塔钢铁公司和印度的其他大公司，希望借此控制印度的冶金业。
    “今天报”记者又说，美国对印度的政策的目标是驱除英国在印度的势力。
    美国加紧夺取英国的原料基地
    据新华社讯：在缩小了的世界市场上，英国正在拚命抵抗它的垂涎的美国“朋友”，保持和维护它在它的殖民帝国中的地位。东南亚的属地对于英国垄断资本家具有极大的意义，因为他们从那里输出锡和橡胶这些极有价值的原料而获得庞大的利润。
    美国垄断企业想利用英国经济财政方面的困难来夺取英国原料基地的企图，已使英国垄断企业的这些高额利润受到了威胁。
    英国“世界新闻与评论”周刊最近发表一篇讨论马来亚的经济危机和美国压力的论文，文中引用了许多有关英美争夺东南亚的原料与市场的事实。
    这个周刊指出，远在一九四七年，美国垄断资本家就曾利用英国缺乏美元的情况，要求英国以马来亚和它的其他殖民地的某些重要原料供给美国。
    美国是一个主要的橡胶买主，它利用许多措施，例如限制美国工业对天然橡胶的消耗和发展人造橡胶的生产等办法，来左右全世界的橡胶价格，在橡胶市场上给英、荷集团以致命的打击。
    锡是马来亚输出的另一种最重要的原料，并且对于美国具有极大的价值。美国在一九四八年争取到较低的出口税，于是便开始拚命囤积锡。到一九五○年为止，它所收购的锡占马来亚锡的全部输出量的百分之七十八，而所付的价钱却比世界市场上一般的价格低得多。
    后来，美国垄断企业又利用恶名昭著的马歇尔计划作为武器，对一切原料市场发动了攻势。美国众议院拨款委员会曾公开要求美国应有同等权利向接受马歇尔计划“援助”的国家的殖民地投资，这些殖民地应根据优惠条件将原料供给美国。
    美国扩张的次一阶段便是借口实施杜鲁门第四点计划侵入英国属地。美国政府“援助”落后地区是有条件的，那就是美国投资家应享有参与管理这些地区各种经济部门的权利。
     这个周刊指出：自一九五○年以约翰·麦尔比为首的美国代表团到达马来亚以后，美国对马来亚的侵入愈益加强起来。同时，美国的私营公司对于马来亚的橡胶园和锡矿也开始越来越“发生兴趣”。
    美国人同时还利用日本工业和财政方面的力量，来加强他们在马来亚和东南亚其他国家的扩张。
