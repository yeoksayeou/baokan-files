Li Jianyuan, an accountant at the Tianjin Private Zhenxing Rubber Factory, devised a way to improve the rubber packing of tube water wheels, saving the state a significant amount of rubber raw materials. Initially, he drew several diagrams of improved water wheel packing and discussed them with everyone in the factory, but without result. The Tianjin Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce learned of this matter and immediately encouraged and supported him, introducing him to the former Haihe Engineering Department of the Ministry of Water Resources to understand the structure and usage of the rubber packing in the field. The responsible comrade of the Ship Repair Factory of the department also provided him with a set of iron pads and pressure plates for clamping the rubber packing on the water wheel as research materials. With the strong help and encouragement from all sides, Li Jianyuan returned to the factory to continue his research, and finally came up with a way to improve the original rubber packing using a hollow form.

The Ministry of Water Resources of the Central People's Government attached great importance to Li Jianyuan's method of improving the rubber packing. After receiving the materials of Li Jianyuan's experiment forwarded by the Tianjin Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce, the ministry immediately assigned technicians to study them and made further improvements and experiments based on his design, finally achieving success. His improvement of the water wheel rubber packing can save the country a lot of financial resources every year. Calculated based on the rubber packing used by the Liberation-style water wheels, each hollow rubber packing can save one-third of the raw materials compared to the original rubber packing. If we calculate the number of rubber packing required for the nationwide promotion of tube water wheels each year and the number of rubber packing that need to be replaced for the original tube water wheels, we can save raw materials worth 3.7 billion yuan each year. In order to make this kind of rubber packing widely used everywhere, the Ministry of Water Resources of the Central People's Government has decided to promote it nationwide. Because Li Jianyuan's transformation of the rubber packing can save the country a lot of wealth, the Central Ministry of Water Resources awarded Li Jianyuan 2 million yuan in RMB to show encouragement.

    李建远改进管子水车的皮钱
    天津市私营振兴橡胶厂的会计李建远，设法改良管子水车的皮钱，为国家节省了大量橡胶原料。最初他画了几张改良水车皮钱的图样在厂里和大家讨论，没有得到结果。天津市工商局知道了这件事情，立即鼓励和支持他，并介绍他到前水利部海河工程处去实地了解皮钱的构造和使用情况。该处船舶修理厂负责同志并供给他水车上卡皮钱的铁垫和压板一套，以作研究材料。李建远在各方面的大力帮助和鼓励下，又回厂继续研究，终于想出了用空心形式改良原有皮钱的办法。
    中央人民政府水利部很重视李建远改良皮钱的办法。该部在收到天津市工商局转到的李建远试验的材料后，即指派技术人员加以研究，并根据他的设计，作了进一步的改进和试验，最后终于获得成功。他对水车皮钱的改进，每年可以为国家节约大量资财。以解放式水车所用的皮钱来计算，每个空心式皮钱，比原来的皮钱可以节省三分之一的原料。如果拿全国每年推广管子水车所需用的皮钱数量以及原有管子水车需要更换的皮钱数量来计算，每年可节省价值三十七亿元的原料。为了使各地普遍采用这种皮钱，中央人民政府水利部已决定在全国范围内加以推广。中央水利部因为李建远对皮钱的这一改造可使国家节约大量财富，特奖给李建远人民币二百万元，以示鼓励。
