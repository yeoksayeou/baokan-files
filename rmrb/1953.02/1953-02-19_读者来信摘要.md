　　Do Not Distribute New Year Pictures Spreading Feudal Ideas
　　Editor's Note: During the Spring Festival, many New Year pictures reflecting the new social life of the people and various national constructions have been widely distributed in various places and have been welcomed by the broad masses. However, there are still some old New Year pictures containing feudal ideas that are still spreading among the masses. Our newspaper has recently received letters from readers suggesting that relevant departments should promptly deal with these old New Year pictures containing feudal toxins. These opinions are correct. The Shanghai and Tianjin Municipal Culture Bureaus should study methods of dealing with these New Year pictures with the local publishing industry.
　　
　　Some New Year Pictures Spread Feudal Superstitious Toxins
　　Comrade Hou Jizhong wrote: Recently, some of the New Year pictures sold in rural fairs and towns still contain feudal toxins, and they are spreading bad influences. For example, on a New Year picture stall in Yongbei Market, Huolu County, there is a "Twenty-Four Filial Exemplars" (produced by Shanghai Changchun Picture Company). An old gentleman looked at it and shook his head, saying that today's children are not as filial as they used to be. I suggest that the cultural authorities should take effective measures to earnestly do a good job in the publication and distribution of New Year pictures.
　　
　　Comrade Han Tongyu wrote from Jixian, Henan: Recently, I saw that the New Year pictures sold on the streets generally have political significance, but there are a few New Year pictures that are not good, such as the "True Portraits of Sages, Worthies, Generals, and Ministers," "Latest Complete Chart of Twenty-Four Filial Exemplars," and "Investiture of the Gods of the Three Religions" produced by Shanghai Changchun Picture Company. I believe that in New China, these picture books with feudal and superstitious toxins cannot be allowed to spread. I hope that the local cultural leading organs will strengthen the leadership of the publishing industry.

　　Tianjin Liansheng Paper Picture Store Actually Adds New Titles to Old New Year Pictures
　　The Propaganda Department of the Zunhua County Party Committee wrote: In the past few days, picture stores in our county have been selling many old New Year pictures with new titles and old content published by Tianjin Liansheng Paper Picture Store, such as "Liu Bei Marries" changed to "Freedom of Marriage." This New Year picture distorts the marriage system that praises the feudal dynasty as a new marriage system, which is slander against our new marriage policy. Another example is changing "Guan Yunchang Goes to a Meeting Alone" to "Resist America, Aid Korea, and Defend Our Homes and Country." This equates the righteous act of our Chinese People's Volunteers going to Korea to assist the Korean brothers in opposing the American aggressors with the wars between feudal rulers in history, completely distorting the political significance of resisting America and aiding Korea. Other old New Year pictures include changing "Mencius' Mother Moves Three Times" to "Labor is Glorious" and "The Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove" to "Rural Harvest, Seven Old Men Enjoying Themselves," and so on. We suggest that the cultural leading organs appropriately deal with this type of New Year picture.

　　Why Does Shunyi County Charge a "Bridge Toll"?
　　Gao Hongliang and others wrote: There is a Chaobai River east of Shunyi County. Originally, there was no bridge on the river, and it was very inconvenient for residents east of the river to go to the city. The Shunyi County People's Government mobilized the masses to build a bridge in October 1951, which is very good for traffic and the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas. However, a strange thing happened after the bridge was built: all passersby had to pay a "bridge toll." The county sent people to set up two posts at the west end of the bridge to sell "bridge tickets"; the price was 300 yuan per person, 500 yuan for a small donkey or cart, and more for those with more goods. Anyone who doesn't have money to buy a "bridge ticket" has to wait three hours. The local people have a lot of opinions about this, saying: The People's Government serves the people, why do we still have to pay a bridge toll after the bridge is built?

　　Reply from the Shunyi County People's Government
　　The Shunyi County People's Government wrote: The soil quality of the Chaobai River bed is not good, and the wooden bridge on the river must be dismantled every rainy season. In autumn, the government purchases wood, hires technicians, and mobilizes the masses to rebuild it. The bridge is located in a key transportation area, with frequent traffic, which is easily damaged and must be maintained and repaired at any time. Therefore, according to the spirit of using the bridge to support the bridge, the method of collecting bridge maintenance fees was stipulated, approved by the Tongxian Special District, and after explaining the significance of the fee collection to the masses through district and village cadres, it began to be implemented at the end of 1951. Under the call for increasing production and practicing economy, the higher authorities instructed that the government would no longer pay for the construction of the bridge in 1953 (the expenses for wood and technicians), so the construction costs in the future will also be paid from the bridge maintenance fees.

　　Editor's Note: We believe that Shunyi County's approach is unreasonable. We hope that the Tongxian Special District and the Shunyi County People's Government will reconsider and reasonably solve this problem.

　　Serious Shortcomings in the Work of the Hejin Post Office
　　Pan Fen and Bifeng wrote: In recent months, due to serious bureaucracy on the part of the leadership, the Hejin Post Office in Shanxi Province has made a mess of postal work.

　　The post office has four rural postal workers and one urban delivery worker. They were originally stipulated to have the urban delivery worker deliver once a day and the rural postal workers make a trip every two days, but in reality, they have not followed this rule. Yaotou in District 1 has not received newspapers for one and a half months in the last three months. The two schools in Fanjia Slope and Guocun ordered the Chinese Young Pioneers Newspaper in November and December of last year, and have not received a single copy to this day. The doctors in District 3 jointly ordered twenty copies of the Health News, and have not seen them delivered for several months. A manuscript from the District 5 Office to the Hejin Farmers' Newspaper took half a month to travel forty miles. Postal workers at the Bureau once lost twelve letters on the road in Xiuren Village, District 2, including ten letters from military dependents. Examples like ordering newspapers but not receiving them, not delivering letters in a timely manner, and losing letters are too numerous to mention. Various places have repeatedly raised opinions and criticisms to the post office, but there has been no improvement, and the masses are very dissatisfied. Su Jun, a primary school teacher in District 5, said: "The news has become history, why would people still subscribe to the newspaper?" This has greatly reduced the number of party newspapers distributed in Hejin County. Xiyaotou in the county used to subscribe to twenty-three copies of the Shanxi Farmers' Newspaper, but now they don't subscribe to a single copy. I think the Shanxi Provincial Post Office should seriously inspect the work of the Hejin Post Office and urge them to correct the above-mentioned shortcomings.

　　Main Situation of Reader Letters This Week
　　From February 2nd to 8th, the reader letter group of this newspaper received a total of 2,044 reader letters and 298 letters from various agencies responding to readers.

　　In the letters this week, letters about opposing bureaucracy, opposing commandism, and opposing violations of law and discipline still accounted for a large proportion. It can be seen that this struggle is also developing more deeply in industrial and mining enterprises; this week, there were 59 letters about this. Some letters accused leading cadres of being undemocratic in their work style, suppressing criticism, violating laws and regulations, and lacking a mass viewpoint, ignoring safety and health work; some criticized factories and mining enterprises for poor management, poor planning, and chaotic systems, which caused a large backlog of funds and equipment, seriously wasting state property. There were 26 letters on the latter, which deserves special attention today when the country is beginning large-scale construction.

　　From the reader letters, it can also be seen that the situation of stockpiling equipment and wasting materials is also quite common and serious in several major water conservancy construction sites. After this newspaper published a reader's expose on February 1st about the Henan Provincial Headquarters for Harnessing the Huai River stockpiling cement and causing serious waste, this week we continued to receive many reader letters exposing similar problems. There were three units that were exposed, and the materials that were stockpiled and wasted included various important equipment in addition to cement.

　　There were 139 letters on marriage issues this week. Many readers reflected the problems that existed in the past in implementing the Marriage Law in their localities, and the current situation of preparing for various activities for the Marriage Law Propaganda and Implementation Month, and some put forward some relevant suggestions. Some readers also exposed the illegal and undisciplined behavior of some local cadres who played with women, forced marriages, and interfered with the freedom of widows to marry, and demanded that they be seriously dealt with in conjunction with the anti-bureaucracy struggle.

　　In addition, this week we also received letters from Chang Chengjie, a reader from Dihua Special District in Xinjiang, and Pan Ronghui, a Yao reader from Zijinghe Yao Autonomous Township in Ningyuan County, Hunan, reflecting the demands of the local ethnic minority people to solve the problems of lack of school buildings and textbooks. In order to strengthen the connection between this newspaper and the people of ethnic minorities, we hope that the people of various ethnic minority areas and the cadres working in the ethnic minority areas will often write to us about the living and production conditions and requirements of the local ethnic minority people.

### 读者来信摘要

1953-02-19

专栏：读者来信摘要

    不要发行散布封建思想的年画
    编者按：在春节期间，许多反映新社会人民生活和国家各种建设的新年画已经在各地大量发行，受到了广大群众的欢迎。但是，也还有一些含有封建思想的旧年画仍旧在群众当中散布。本报近来接到一些读者来信，他们建议有关部门对于这些含有封建毒素的旧年画及时加以处理。这些意见是正确的。上海市、天津市文化局应该和当地出版业研究处理这些年画的办法。
    有些年画散布封建迷信毒素
    侯继仲同志来信：近来在农村各集镇上出售的年画，还有一部分是带有封建的毒素的，它们在散布着不良影响。例如：获鹿县永北集上一家年画摊上，有一张“二十四孝”（上海长春画片公司出品）。一位老先生看了看摇摇头说，现在的孩子们可不如过去孝顺了。我建议文化主管部门应作有效的措施，认真地作好年画的出版发行工作。
    韩同愚同志自河南汲县来信：最近我见到街上所卖的年画，一般的都有政治意义，但有少数年画是不好的，如上海长春画片公司出品的“圣贤将相真像”、“最新二十四孝全图”、“三教封神榜”等。我认为在新中国，这些有封建、迷信毒素的画片是不能允许散布的。希望当地文化领导机关加强对出版业的领导。
    天津联胜纸画店竟在旧年画上乱加新标题
    中共遵化县委宣传部来信：近几天来，我们县里的画片店出售着许多天津联胜纸画店出版的旧内容新标题的旧年画，如“刘备招亲”改为“婚姻自由”，这张年画把歌颂封建皇朝的婚姻制度曲解为新的婚姻制度，这是诽谤了我们的新婚姻政策的。又如把“关云长单刀赴会”改为“抗美援朝，保家卫国”，这是把我们中国人民志愿军志愿赴朝和朝鲜兄弟共同反对美国侵略者的正义行为，与历史上封建统治者之间的战争混为一谈，完全歪曲了抗美援朝的政治意义。他如把“孟母三迁”改为“劳动光荣”，把“竹林七贤”改为“农村丰收七老娱乐”等等的旧年画还很多。我们建议文化领导机关对这一类年画加以适当处理。
    顺义县为什么要收“过桥钱”
    高洪亮等来信：河北省顺义县城东有一条潮白河。河上原来没有桥，河东居民到城里去很不方便。顺义县人民政府发动群众在一九五一年十月修建了
    一座桥，这对来往交通和城乡物资交流都是很好的。但是，在桥修好后却出现了一件奇怪的事情：凡来往行人过桥时都要拿“过桥钱”。县里派人在桥西头设了两个岗，出售“过桥票”；票价单人三百元，小驴、车五百元，东西多的多要。谁要是没钱买
    “过桥票”，就得等三个钟头。当地群众对这件事情很有意见，都说：人民政府是为人民服务的，为什么修了桥还向我们要过桥钱呢？
    顺义县人民政府来信答复
    顺义县人民政府来信：潮白河河床的土质不好，河上木桥每年雨季必须拆除，到秋季由政府采购木材、聘用技工、并发动群众出工重建。该桥位于交通要冲，往来车辆频繁，易受损耗，必须重视护养，随时修补。因此，根据以桥养桥的精神，规定养桥费征收办法，经通县专署批准，并通过区村干部向群众说明征费意义后，在一九五一年底开始施行。在增产节约号召下，上级指示一九五三年政府不再开支该桥的修建费（木材及技工的开支），故今后修建费亦将由养桥费内开支。
    编者按：我们认为顺义县这种做法是不合理的。希望通县专署和顺义县人民政府重新考虑并合理解决这个问题。
    河津邮局工作中有严重缺点
    畔汾、碧峰来信：山西河津邮局在最近几个月来，由于领导方面存在严重的官僚主义，把邮务工作搞得一团糟。
    该邮局有四个下乡邮工，一个城市投递员。他们本来规定城市投递员每天投递一次，下乡邮工两天跑一趟，但实际上并没有按照这个规定执行。一区窑头在最近三个月内就有一个半月没有收到报纸。樊家坡和郭村两个学校在去年十一、十二月份订的中国少年报，到现在一张都没有收到。三区医生们联合订了二十份健康报已经好几个月不见送来。五区区公所给河津农民报社的一个稿件，四十里路就走了半个月。该局邮工有一次在二区修仁村的路上丢掉了十二封信，其中军属的信就占了十封。像这种订报不见报、送信不及时和丢失信件的例子举不胜举。各地曾多次向该邮局提出意见和批评，但至今都没有一点儿改进，群众很不满意。五区小学教师苏俊说：“新闻都变成了历史，人家还订报干什么。”就这样使党报在河津县的发行数量大大缩减了。该县东西窑头过去订有二十三份山西农民报，现在一份也不订了。我认为山西省邮局应对河津邮局的工作认真加以检查，并督促他们改正上述缺点。
    一周读者来信主要情况
    二月二日到八日，本报读者来信组共收到读者来信二千零四十四件，各机关答复读者的信二百九十八件。
    这一周的来信中，有关反对官僚主义、反对命令主义、反对违法乱纪的信件仍占很大比重。可以看出：这个斗争在工矿企业部门中也日益深入地开展着；这一周，关于这方面的来信就有五十九封。有的来信控告领导干部作风不民主、压制批评、违法乱纪以及缺乏群众观点、忽视安全卫生工作；有的批评厂矿企业管理不善，计划不周，制度混乱，使资金器材大批积压，严重浪费国家财富。后一种来信就有二十六封，在国家开始大规模建设的今天，这个情况值得特别重视。
    从读者来信中还可以看出，积压器材、浪费物资的情况在几个主要水利建设工程工地中也是相当普遍而严重的。二月一日本报发表了读者揭发河南省治淮总指挥部积压水泥、造成严重浪费的来信后，这一周中又连续收到不少继续揭发类似问题的读者来信。被揭发的单位有三个，积压浪费的物资除了水泥以外，还有各种重要器材。
    关于婚姻问题的来信这一周共有一百三十九件。许多读者反映了当地过去贯彻婚姻法工作中存在的问题，和目前为宣传贯彻婚姻法运动月进行各项准备工作的情况，有的提出了一些有关的建议。有些读者还揭发了某些地区干部玩弄女性、强迫结婚、干涉寡妇婚姻自由等违法乱纪的行为，要求结合反官僚主义斗争作严肃的处理。
    此外，这一周中我们还收到新疆迪化专区读者常成杰和湖南宁远县紫荆河瑶族自治乡瑶族读者盘荣辉反映当地少数民族人民要求解决学校缺乏校舍、课本等问题的来信。为了加强本报和少数民族人民的联系，我们希望各少数民族地区人民和在少数民族地区工作的干部经常把当地少数民族人民的生活、生产各方面的情况和要求写信告诉我们。
