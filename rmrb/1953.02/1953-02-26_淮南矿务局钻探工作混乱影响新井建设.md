    Huainan Mining Bureau's Drilling Work Chaos Affects New Mine Construction

    The Huainan Mining Bureau failed to complete its 1952 drilling tasks. The state required the Huainan Mining Bureau to drill 6,600 meters, but by the end of November last year, the bureau had only drilled 2,215 meters, including 405 meters of abandoned holes. Moreover, the quality of the core samples already extracted had not been checked, which seriously affected the construction progress of new mines.

    The Huainan Mining Bureau used a total of seven drilling rigs last year. Except for one drilling rig that drilled 1,073 meters, the situation with the others was very poor. The main reason is that the leading cadres of the mining bureau did not pay enough attention to the drilling work. First, they lacked the determination to transfer cadres to strengthen the drilling team. They had originally put forward a list of technical and management personnel, but when lower levels complained about production difficulties, they didn't transfer them; it was not until the end of November last year that they transferred one management person and one mechanical and electrical technician. At the same time, they did not seriously mobilize and organize other units to cooperate and support the drilling work. Therefore, some units only paid attention to production and did not actively help the drilling work. For example, when drilling workers wanted to learn from advanced experience and use yellow mud slurry, the head of the transportation section dumped the yellow mud slurry that the workers had loaded on the truck and were preparing to transport to the construction site, saying that it affected his production. Also, on one occasion, the diesel engine of a drilling rig at Bagong Mountain was waiting for diesel, but the material clerk transported the diesel to a station far from the construction site and left it there, causing the drilling rig to stop running for two days.

    The drilling work also lacked planning, and there were often phenomena of drilling blindly without distinguishing between priorities. Sometimes, when a drilling rig was drilling according to the design, the leadership suddenly thought that production wells needed to be drilled, so they ordered the drilling rig to be moved to drill production wells, leaving the drill holes needed for the construction of new mines unattended. Sometimes, the leadership suddenly wanted to explore whether there was coal in a certain place, and regardless of whether it was within the plan, they casually moved the drilling rig to drill. Sometimes, when a drilling rig had an accident, instead of actively trying to salvage it, they abandoned the drill hole and the equipment stuck in the hole.

    The leading cadres of the Huainan Mining Bureau also rarely checked and inquired about the work situation of the drilling team. In fact, the responsible cadres of the drilling team were very irresponsible in their work. They only assigned tasks, and when problems arose, they told the workers to "overcome difficulties." Drilling rigs often had accidents, and the drilling team leader always simply criticized the workers, rarely personally helping the workers solve the difficulties. Some construction sites were dozens of kilometers away from the drilling team's residence and warehouse, and the responsible cadres of the drilling team did not properly supervise the staff in charge of materials and logistics to carry out supply work, so the transportation, procurement, supply, installation, and repair work had to be completely borne by the staff at the construction site. This greatly dispersed the strength of the drilling work. Even the drilling team's technicians, because they were busy with these things all day, had little time to personally manage the drilling rigs. In addition, the construction site did not have spare parts for the drilling rigs, so as soon as an accident occurred, it affected the drilling rig for a long time. Besides, the drilling team often casually transferred workers, affecting the work and causing great dissatisfaction among the workers. One worker had been transferred three times in one month. Some workers said: "I just got familiar with this drilling rig, and they want to transfer me to another drilling rig, I really don't know how to do it." The drilling team also did not pay attention to the storage and repair of drill pipes, which the state is currently most lacking, resulting in severe losses of drill pipes. The Huainan Mining Bureau's drilling team originally had more than 1,000 meters of Japanese-style drill pipes, but they were not repaired when they were damaged, and now there are only two or three hundred meters left. Even the Soviet-style new pipes were not repaired when they were damaged, and the drill pipes and casings were thrown on the muddy ground, unattended. Forty drill pipes that were sent to the repair shop were not only not repaired, but twenty were lost. Now, nearly 200 meters of the 1,700 meters of Soviet new drill pipes have been damaged; if they are not repaired as soon as possible, it will be difficult for the seven drilling rigs to operate simultaneously this year. These problems of the drilling team have greatly affected the progress of the drilling work, but the leadership of the Huainan Mining Bureau has not paid serious attention to them.

    The Huainan Mining Bureau and the trade union are also very unconcerned about the drilling workers' lives, learning, and welfare. Some rights that production workers can enjoy are not available to drilling workers, which greatly affects the drilling workers' morale. The workers said: "Everyone says that capital construction is important, but we are hitting walls everywhere, no one cares, no one wants us."

    The Huainan Mining Bureau should immediately rectify the drilling work and change this serious chaotic situation. (Gao Xianchou)

    淮南矿务局钻探工作混乱影响新井建设
    淮南矿务局没有完成一九五二年的钻探任务。国家要求淮南矿务局钻探六千六百公尺，但到去年十一月底为止，该局仅钻探了二千二百一十五公尺，其中还包括四百零五公尺的废眼，而且还没有检查已经取出的岩心的质量，因此，严重影响了新井的建设进度。
    淮南矿务局去年共使用了七部钻机，除一部钻机钻探了一千零七十三公尺外，其余的情况都很不好。主要的原因是矿务局的领导干部对钻探工作不够重视。首先，他们对于抽调干部加强钻探队工作缺乏决心。他们原已提出一些技术人员和管理人员的名单，但下面一叫生产困难，就又不调了；直到去年十一月底才抽出一名管理人员、一名机电技术人员。同时，他们也没有认真地动员与组织其他单位配合和支援钻探工作。因此，有些单位只重视生产，不积极帮助钻探工作。例如钻探工人要学习先进经验使用黄泥浆，运输科长却把工人装在车上准备运往工地的黄泥浆倒掉，说是影响了他的生产。又如有一次八公山的钻机柴油机等着柴油用，材料员把柴油运到离工地还很远的车站就不管了，钻机因此停止运转了两天。
    钻探工作的进行也缺少计划，常常发生不分轻重缓急、盲目钻探的现象。有时钻机正在按照设计进行打钻，领导方面忽然想到生产井口需要打钻了，就命令把钻机搬去打钻生产井口，把建设新矿井需要的钻眼丢下不管。有时，领导方面忽然想要探查一下某地是否有煤，不管是否在计划之内，也就轻率地把钻机搬去打钻。有时，钻机发生了事故，他们不但不积极设法挽救，反而丢下这个钻孔和卡在孔内的器材不要了。
    淮南矿务局的领导干部对钻探队的工作情况，也很少检查过问。事实上，钻探队的负责干部对工作很不负责任。他们只是布置任务，有了问题，就叫工人“克服困难”。钻机经常发生事故，钻探队长总是单纯批评工人，很少亲自去帮助工人解决困难。某些工地与钻探队的驻地、仓库相隔几十公里，钻探队的负责干部也没有很好地督促队中负责材料和总务的工作人员进行供应工作，因此，运输、采购、供给、安装、修理等项工作，就得完全由工地上的工作人员负担。这就大大分散了钻探工作的力量。甚至就是钻探队的技长们，也因为整天忙于这些事情，很少有时间亲自掌握钻机。加以工地没有钻机零件备品，只要一出事故，就影响钻机很久不能转动。此外，钻探队常常随便调动工人，影响工作，引起了工人的很大不满。有一个工人曾经在一个月中被调了三次。有的工人说：“我刚把这部钻机摸熟一点，又要把我往另外的钻机上调，真不知道要怎样干才好。”对于目前国家最感缺乏的钻杆，钻探队也不注意保管和修理，以致钻杆损失得很厉害。淮南矿务局钻探队原有日本式的钻杆一千多公尺，但是坏了不修，现在只剩下二三百公尺了。连苏联式的新管材也是坏了不修，钻杆和套管扔在泥地上，无人保管。曾经送到修理厂去修理的四十根钻杆，不但没有修成，反而丢了二十根。现在，一千七百多公尺的苏联新钻杆已经坏了将近二百公尺；假使不及早修理，今年七部钻机同时开动将会发生困难。钻探队的这些问题，对钻探工作的进行影响很大，但是，淮南矿务局领导方面还没有加以严重的注意。
    淮南矿务局和工会对待钻探工人的生活、学习、福利等问题也很不关心。有些生产工人能享受的权利，钻探工人却得不到，大大影响了钻探工人的情绪。工人们说：“都说基本建设重要，我们可是到处碰钉子，没人管，没人要。”
    淮南矿务局应当立即整顿钻探工作，改变这种严重的混乱现象。（高先畴）
