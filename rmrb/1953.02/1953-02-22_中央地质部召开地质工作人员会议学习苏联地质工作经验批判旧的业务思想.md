Xinhua News Agency, February 21st—The Central Geological Department of the People's Government convened a national geological workers' meeting from January 20th to February 12th, focusing on systematically studying the advanced theories and experiences of Soviet geological work. Through learning from advanced Soviet experiences and connecting them with past geological work, this meeting initially criticized old business ideologies and formulated several important draft technical specifications, creating favorable conditions for completing the 1953 national geological exploration plan.

The meeting began with an opening speech by Vice Minister He Changgong. He said: This year is the first year of the national Five-Year Construction Plan, and the Geological Department is shouldering the huge and glorious task of resource exploration. Whether this task can be completed is related to the speed of national industrialization. The convening of this meeting is an important measure to complete and overfulfill the national exploration plan. Minister Li Siguang then pointed out in his report: The guiding principle of this meeting is to learn from advanced Soviet experiences and criticize old business ideologies in order to improve efficiency and ensure quality. Minister Li Siguang elaborated on the reasons why Soviet science and technology are the most advanced in the world. He said: Soviet science, including geology, has integrated the world's science and technology and has been transformed and developed in the long-term practice of socialist construction, accumulating extremely rich experience. After listening to reports from four engineers of the Geological Department on exploring copper, coal, iron, and other minerals, the meeting spent most of its time listening to and discussing nine special reports by six Soviet experts. These special reports systematically introduced the basic requirements for geological surveys and mine exploration, the classification, calculation, and evaluation of mineral reserves, the geological work necessary for mineral development, as well as a series of advanced experiences in the geological exploration of copper, chromium, coal, petroleum, hydrology, and engineering geology. These reports all provided examples of combining geological scientific theory with geological exploration practice, clearly pointing out that the main task of geological workers is to discover the mineral raw materials needed by the national economy and hand them over to the national industrial departments for use as soon as possible. To complete this task, geological work must be carried out in a certain order and should be based on scientific accuracy. In order to better discuss and study the reports of Soviet experts, the meeting organized eight categories of twenty-four groups, including ferrous metals, non-ferrous metals, non-metals, engineering geology, drilling, surveying, testing, and physical exploration. In discussing the reports, each group connected them with past work and initially exposed and criticized some old business ideologies and practices.

The situation of the meeting showed that many geological personnel scattered in the field and a large number of newly emerged young geological workers had mostly never been exposed to the advanced experience of Soviet geological work in the past. Many old geological personnel who had shouldered or are shouldering the important task of leading geological exploration teams composed of thousands of people have also initially experienced the advancement of Soviet geological work experience in their actual work. Therefore, they generally showed enthusiasm and positivity in this study. Many people reflected: "The reports of Soviet experts are not only technically very high but also have a high degree of political and ideological content." They said: "After this study, we have mastered weapons and increased our confidence in completing tasks." However, some people originally held skeptical attitudes towards advanced Soviet experience, and only after education by various facts at the meeting did they begin to change.

Based on learning from advanced Soviet experiences, the meeting organized ten draft specification groups, who, combined with China's actual situation, formulated advanced and realistic technical specification drafts such as the Geological Survey Outline, the Engineering Geology Specification Draft, the Drilling Operation Regulations, the Surveying Specifications, and the Large-Scale Rapid Analysis Assembly Line Operation Method, which will become the guidelines for geological exploration work this year.

The meeting concluded with a summary by Vice Minister Liu Jie. He said: This meeting is the beginning of responding to Chairman Mao's great call to learn from the Soviet Union, the beginning of realizing Vice Premier Chen Yun's instruction on the great transformation of geological work, and also the beginning of the business transformation and construction of geological work. He emphasized that launching a climax of learning from advanced Soviet experiences and carrying out business transformation and construction are the basic links to complete the country's major resource exploration tasks. This year, the Geological Department will organize a guided, backbone-supported, and broad-based climax of learning from the Soviet Union.

A large number of people attended the meeting, including 400 official representatives, including geological personnel and administrative leaders from the Geological Department, the Nanjing Office of the Geological Department, the Geological Bureaus of major administrative regions, various field exploration teams and survey teams, as well as representatives of drilling, surveying, testing, and physical exploration personnel, professors from the Beijing and Changchun Geological Colleges and geology departments of universities across the country, and geological personnel from various central industrial and transportation departments. Relevant departments of the Central Government and all over the country sent representatives to attend the meeting as nonvoting delegates, and the number of nonvoting delegates increased continuously from the initial 97 to 338.

    中央地质部召开地质工作人员会议学习苏联地质工作经验批判旧的业务思想
    【新华社二十一日讯】中央人民政府地质部在一月二十日到二月十二日召开了以系统地学习苏联地质工作先进理论和经验为中心的全国地质工作人员会议。这次会议通过学习苏联先进经验，联系过去的地质工作，初步批判了旧的业务思想，制订出了若干重要的技术规范草案，为完成一九五三年的国家地质勘探计划创造了有利的条件。
    会议首先由何长工副部长致开幕词。他说：今年是国家实行五年建设计划的第一年，地质部担负了巨大而光荣的资源勘探任务。这个任务能否完成，关系着国家工业化的速度。这次会议的召开，就是为了完成和超额完成国家勘探计划的一项重要的措施。李四光部长接着在报告中指出：这次会议的方针，是学习苏联先进经验，批判旧的业务思想，以提高效率，保证质量。李四光部长阐述苏联的科学技术是世界上最先进的原因。他说：苏联的科学，包括地质学在内，是综合了全世界的科学技术，而且在社会主义建设的长期实践中加以改造和发展，积累了极其丰富的经验的。会议在听取了地质部四位工程师关于探寻铜、煤、铁等矿产问题的报告之后，用大部分的时间听取和讨论了六位苏联专家的九个专题报告。这些专题报告系统地介绍了地质普查和矿区勘探的基本要求，矿产储量的分类、计算和评价，为开发矿产所必需的地质工作，以及铜、铬、煤、石油等的地质勘探和水文地质，工程地质等一系列的先进经验。这些报告都提供了地质科学理论与地质勘探实际相结合的榜样，明确地提出了地质工作者的主要任务在于发现国民经济所需要的矿物原料，并把它尽快地交给国家工业部门使用。为了完成这个任务，地质工作必须按照一定的顺序来进行，它应该安置在科学的准确的基础之上。为了更好地讨论学习苏联专家的报告，会议组织了黑色金属、有色金属、非金属、工程地质、钻探、测量、化验、物理探矿八类二十四个小组。各小组在讨论报告中，都联系过去的工作，初步揭露和批判了一些旧的业务思想和作法。
    会议的情况表明，许多散布在各地野外工作的地质人员和大批新涌进的青年地质工作者，大部分过去都没有接触过苏联地质工作的先进经验，许多担负了或正在担负起带领千百人组成的地质勘探队重任的老地质人员，在实际工作中也已初步体验到苏联地质工作经验的先进，因此他们在这次学习中，一般都表现了热情积极。许多人反映：“苏联专家的报告，不但是技术很高，而且带有高度的政治性和思想性。”他们说：“经过这次学习以后，我们掌握了武器，提高了完成任务的信心。”但是也有部分人员，原来对苏联先进经验抱着怀疑态度，直到经过会议上各种事实的教育才开始有了转变。
    会议在学习苏联先进经验的基础上，组织了十个规范草案小组，他们结合我国实际情况，制订了地质普查纲要、工程地质规范草案、钻探操作规程、测量规范、大规模快速分析流水作业法等先进的现实的技术规范草案，成为今年进行地质勘探工作的准则。
    会议最后由刘杰副部长作总结。他说：这次会议是响应毛主席关于学习苏联的伟大号召的开端，是实现陈云副总理指示地质工作大转变的开端，也是地质工作业务的改造和建设的开端。他着重指出：掀起学习苏联先进经验的高潮，进行业务改造和建设，是完成国家重大的资源勘探任务的基本环节。今年地质部要组织一个有领导的、有骨干的、广泛的学习苏联的高潮。
    这次会议参加的人数很多，其中正式代表有四百人，包括地质部、地质部南京办事处、各大行政区地质局、各野外勘探队和普查队的地质人员和行政领导干部，以及钻探、测量、化验、物理探矿等人员的代表，北京、长春两地质学院和全国各大学地质系的教授，中央各工业、交通部门的地质人员。中央及全国各地有关部门并派代表列席会议，列席人数不断增加，由最初的九十七人增加到三百三十八人。
