Xinhua News Agency, 19th: According to the Vietnam News Agency on the 16th, the General Command of the Vietnam People's Army recently issued a communique stating that, in order to relieve the besieged French forces in An Khe, the French army concentrated a large number of troops to land on the coast of Qui Nhon on January 29th. The landing French forces included seven battalions of infantry and paratroopers transferred from North and South Vietnam, most of the French air force and navy from Central and South Vietnam, and a large number of mechanized vehicles and artillery.

After landing, the French army was met with a head-on blow from the People's Army, and finally forced to hastily withdraw from Qui Nhon on February 6th. Thus, the French army's landing operation, which was touted as aiming to cover up its disastrous defeat in the An Khe area, completely failed.

The communique said that in half a month of fighting in the An Khe area, the People's Army eliminated six major French strongholds, annihilated more than seven companies of French troops, and seized a large number of weapons. The People's Army's victory in this operation in An Khe increased the pressure on the French forces in the Central and Southern Vietnamese Highlands and will advance the guerrilla warfare in this area.

The An Khe Pass is a very important stronghold. It is the gateway to the Central and Southern Vietnamese Highlands, located on Highway 19 connecting Qui Nhon to Pleiku and Kontum. Since 1948, the People's Army has fought several battles with the French army here, each attack inflicting serious damage on the French army's defense system in the highlands.

    越南人民军安溪地区战果巨大
    击退在归仁登陆的法军
    【新华社十九日讯】据越南通讯社十六日讯：越南人民军总司令部最近发表公报说，法国军队为了解救安溪被围的法军，一月二十九日曾集中了大量的军队在归仁海岸登陆。登陆的法军包括从北越和南越调去的步兵和伞兵七个营、中越和南越的法国空军和海军的大部、以及大量的机械化车辆和炮兵。
    法军在登陆后，遭到了人民军的迎头痛击，最后在二月六日被迫从归仁匆忙撤走。至此，法军所吹嘘的目的在掩饰它在安溪地区惨败的登陆战就完全失败了。
    公报说：人民军在安溪地区作战半月，共拔除法军主要据点六处，歼灭法军七个连以上，缴获大量武器。人民军这次在安溪作战的胜利，增加了对中越南部高原地区法军的压力，并将推进这一地区的游击战争。
    安溪山隘是一个很重要的据点。它是中越南部高原的门户，位于归仁通往波来古和昆嵩的第十九号公路上。一九四八年以来，人民军曾在这里和法军作战了几次，每次进攻都给法军在高原的防御体系以严重的打击。
