China National Pharmaceutical Corporation and its Subordinate Tianjin and Suiyuan Companies
Displayed Shameless Bad Faith in Supplying Equipment to National Hospitals

    According to a letter from reader Guo Rui, when the China National Pharmaceutical Corporation and its subordinate Suiyuan and Tianjin companies sold X-ray machines to the Suiyuan Provincial People's Hospital, they displayed an extremely vile business style characterized by a singular pursuit of profit and a lack of good faith. On May 2, 1952, the Suiyuan Provincial People's Hospital ordered a Soviet deep X-ray therapy machine from the Suiyuan Provincial Pharmaceutical Company for 436 million yuan, with the agreement that delivery would be in Suiyuan and that the company would be responsible for installation and transportation, with payment made after the goods arrived in satisfactory condition. The company then sent personnel to Tianjin to handle the goods. On May 20th of last year, the company called, emphasizing that payment must be made immediately, otherwise the previous agreement could not be fulfilled. The Suiyuan Provincial People's Hospital had no choice but to repeatedly petition the Provincial Financial and Economic Commission for approval and temporarily borrowed 450 million yuan, which was directly allocated to the company on May 22nd. After receiving the payment, the company promised to deliver the goods within two weeks.
    However, the company still did not deliver the goods three weeks later. The hospital negotiated with them. The person in charge of the company initially said that one of the machine's radiation tubes was broken, and later said that both were broken, asking the hospital to purchase another British Newton diagnostic machine for 470 million yuan, guaranteeing that all machine parts would be available and that delivery would still be in Suiyuan, with the pharmaceutical company fully responsible for installation and transportation. The hospital had no choice but to agree. In mid-June of last year, the person in charge of the company said that the two rectifier tubes of the machine were slightly loose, asking if the hospital would still buy it. The hospital replied that they would definitely buy the machine, but the rectifier tubes should be replaced with good ones. They then asked, "If the head office doesn't replace them, do you still want it?" The hospital replied that they would buy it even if they were not replaced, but the reason for not replacing them must be stated in writing. In late July of last year, the person in charge of the company said again: "The rectifier tubes of this machine are loose, and although the head office has stock, they will not replace them. Otherwise, you can buy a small Siemens machine, or wait for us to transfer a Soviet deep therapy machine to you in the future." The hospital was in urgent need of use and did not agree to wait for another machine. In early August of last year, the Suiyuan Provincial Health Bureau specially hired Shi Yuantong, an X-ray technician from the Peking University Medical College, to Tianjin to inspect the machine so that it could be transported to Suiyuan as soon as possible. When Shi Yuantong contacted the pharmaceutical company in Tianjin to inspect and ship the goods, Feng, the director of the company's equipment department, said: "That Newton diagnostic machine you wanted was sold to the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant Hospital in Beijing long ago. Don't think the machine is broken, many people want to buy it but can't!" Shi Yuantong made a wasted trip and had to tell the situation to the Suiyuan Provincial Health Bureau. Representatives from the Suiyuan Provincial Health Bureau, the Suiyuan Provincial People's Hospital, and the Suiyuan Provincial Pharmaceutical Company went to Tianjin one after another on August 16th of last year to negotiate. It was not until the end of September of last year that the following situation was understood: The Tianjin Pharmaceutical Company sold the Newton diagnostic machine, which was originally sold to the Suiyuan Provincial People's Hospital for 470 million yuan, to the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant Hospital in Beijing for 550 million yuan in early July of last year. When the Suiyuan representatives negotiated with the Tianjin Pharmaceutical Company, they initially refused to meet. After meeting, Meng Deli, the manager of the company, said that because the Suiyuan Provincial People's Hospital did not reply within three days, it was sold to another party. Feng, the director of the company's equipment department, insisted that the Newton diagnostic machine was never transferred to Suiyuan, but after the representatives of the Suiyuan Provincial People's Hospital found witnesses and provided evidence from various allocation accounts and telegrams, Manager Meng of the company had nothing to say and then said that he did not know about this matter and that it was entirely done by Director Feng. Director Feng still played rogue and said: "The mistake has been made, what can you do to me! Let the higher authorities handle it as they please!" Later, Manager Meng emphasized that the machine was entrusted by the China National Pharmaceutical Corporation to the Tianjin Company to receive the goods from the China Equipment Company, and it must be transferred back to the China National Pharmaceutical Corporation before being transferred to Suiyuan. The Suiyuan representatives went to talk to them again, but they ignored them. The representatives had no choice but to go to the China National Pharmaceutical Corporation. Lu, the chief of the allocation section of the China National Pharmaceutical Corporation, said that the machine had not been put into storage and would be allocated after it was put into storage. After waiting for another three days, when they went to ask him again, Chief Lu said, you should still go to the Tianjin Company to negotiate. Finally, the representatives went to the Tianjin Company again, but the Tianjin Company had no way to deal with it and only agreed to get the Newton diagnostic machine back from Shijingshan and give it to Suiyuan.
    The parts of this machine were originally complete. However, when the representatives of the Suiyuan Provincial People's Hospital inspected it, many of the main parts were missing. The representatives of the Tianjin Company said that the parts were all at the China National Pharmaceutical Corporation and could be retrieved. After the representatives went to the China National Pharmaceutical Corporation, they said that they had the parts, but they would have to be paid for separately. The hospital representatives asked why they had to be paid for separately, and they said that it would be 520 million yuan with the parts and 470 million yuan without the parts. The representatives went to Manager Meng of the Tianjin Company again to resolve the issue. Manager Meng said that the matter was wrong, and if you don't pay, you still can't take the high-voltage wire and other parts. After the representatives criticized him, Manager Meng had no choice but to agree to give the parts, but he did not decide when to give them.
    After the large parts of the machine were shipped, other main parts such as high-voltage wires, darkroom equipment, a set of equipment for gastrointestinal use, and spare parts such as X-ray tubes and rectifier tubes were still at the China National Pharmaceutical Corporation and could not be shipped. The China National Pharmaceutical Corporation pushed the city company to ship the goods, and the city company pushed the China National Pharmaceutical Corporation to ship the goods directly. After repeated negotiations, it was finally determined that the China National Pharmaceutical Corporation would ship the goods directly. However, the parts had not been delivered by the end of November of last year, so that the X-ray technician from Peking University had come to Suiyuan twice, but could not install the X-ray machine due to the lack of parts, and the machine could not serve the patients. At the end of last year, when the final accounts were about to be reported, the Suiyuan Provincial People's Hospital had no choice but to request the Suiyuan Provincial Pharmaceutical Company to write a letter of introduction and send someone to the China National Pharmaceutical Corporation to negotiate. The China National Pharmaceutical Corporation then transferred the main parts of this Newton diagnostic machine to the Tianjin Company. When the comrades of the Suiyuan Provincial People's Hospital went to the Tianjin Pharmaceutical Company to get the parts, the company re-evaluated the high-voltage wire, real-time photography equipment, and other parts that should have been included in this machine at 200 million yuan. The machine that the Suiyuan Provincial People's Hospital could originally buy for 470 million yuan now costs 700 million yuan. Several patients in Suiyuan have been unable to receive X-ray treatment, and this loss is incalculable. In order to solve this problem, the Tianjin Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce gave the Suiyuan Provincial People's Hospital a lot of help. But when will the problem be solved, they cannot answer.
    Based on the above facts, it can be fully explained that the China National Pharmaceutical Corporation and its subordinate Suiyuan and Tianjin companies, although having gone through the "Three-Anti" movement, still have serious bureaucratic style and philistine habits. Their approach can never complete the supply task that state-owned pharmaceutical companies should bear, and even less can they play a leading role in private merchants. It is recommended that the Central Ministry of Commerce and the People's Procuratorate pay attention to inspecting the work of the China National Pharmaceutical Corporation, and hope that this incident will be handled as a special case.

### 中国医药公司及其所属天津市、绥远省两公司  供应国家医院器材表现了毫无信义的恶习

    中国医药公司及其所属天津市、绥远省两公司
    供应国家医院器材表现了毫无信义的恶习
    据读者郭瑞来信揭露：中国医药公司及其所属的绥远省公司、天津市公司卖给绥远省人民医院X光机的时候，表现了单纯营利、不守信义的极其恶劣的经营作风。绥远省人民医院于一九五二年五月二日向绥远省医药公司订购苏联深部X光治疗机一部，价钱是四亿三千六百万元，说妥在绥远交货，安装运输由该公司负责，货到合格再付款。该公司就派员去天津办货。去年五月二十日，该公司打来电话，强调必须即时付款，否则不能履行前议。绥远省人民医院只得数次呈请省财政经济委员会批准，暂借四亿五千万元，在五月二十二日直接拨给该公司。该公司收到款后，答应两周内即可交货。
    但该公司三周以后仍不交货。院方向其交涉。该公司负责人起初说机器的放射管坏了一个，后来又说两个都坏了，叫医院另购英国牛顿牌诊断机一架，价四亿七千万元，并保证机器零件应有尽有，仍然是在绥远交货，安装运输完全由医药公司负责。医院只得同意。到去年六月中旬，该公司负责人说该机两个整流管微微活动，问医院买不买。院方回答这个机器一定买，但应该换成好的整流管。他们又问：“总公司要不给换，你们要不要。”院方回答，不给换也买，但必须以书面写明不换的理由。去年七月下旬，该公司负责人又说：“这个机器整流管活动，总公司虽有货但不给换。你们不然就买小型西门子机器，或者等待将来再调苏联深部治疗机给你们。”医院急于使用，不同意再等着换别的机器。到去年八月初，绥远省卫生局特聘北京大学医学院X光技师史元同到天津鉴定机器，以便早日运到绥远。当史元同到天津市与医药公司接洽验货发货时，该公司器械部冯主任说：“你们要的那部牛顿牌诊断机早又卖给别人了，不要看机器破，有很多人想买还买不到呢！”史元同白跑了一趟，只好把情况告诉绥远省卫生局。绥远省卫生局和绥远省人民医院以及绥远省医药公司各派代表，于去年八月十六日先后到天津交涉，一直到去年九月底才了解了下列情况：天津市医药公司于去年七月上旬，将原以四亿七千万元卖给绥远省人民医院的那部牛顿牌诊断机，改为五亿五千万元卖给北京市石景山钢铁厂医院。当绥远省代表向天津市医药公司交涉时，他们先是不接见，接见后，该公司孟德利经理说，因绥远省人民医院三天内没有答复，所以就另行出售了。该公司器械部冯主任则硬说牛顿牌诊断机根本没有调给绥远，但是经绥远省人民医院代表找出人证及以各方面的调拨账目和电报作证，该公司孟经理无话可答，才又说此事他不知道，完全是冯主任搞的。冯主任仍然耍无赖说：“错就错了，能把我怎么样！由上级随便处理吧！”后来孟经理强调机器是中国医药公司委托天津市公司接收中国器材公司的东西，必须调回中国医药公司后，再转调绥远。绥远省代表再找他们谈，他们就不理了。代表们只好找到中国医药公司去。中国医药公司调拨科吕科长说，机器没有入库，俟入库后再调拨。又等了三天，再去问他时，吕科长说，你们还是去天津市公司交涉吧。最后代表们再找天津市公司，天津市公司没有办法，才答应把这部牛顿牌诊断机从石景山要回来给绥远。
    这部机器的零件，原来是完备的。但绥远省人民医院代表检查时，许多主要零件都没有了。天津市公司代表说零件都在中国医药公司，去取就可以了。代表们到中国医药公司以后，他们说零件是有，但另外要算钱。医院代表问为什么要另外算钱，他们说带零件五亿二，不带零件四亿七。代表们又去天津市公司找孟经理解决，孟经理说，事情是错了，如果你们不拿钱，高压线等零件还是不能拿去。后经代表们提出批评，孟经理没有办法，才答应给零件，但又不决定什么时候给。
    当机器大件起运之后，其他主要零件如高压线暗室设备、作胃肠用的一套设备和X光管整流管等备品，仍在中国医药公司，不能起运。中国医药公司推市公司发货，市公司又推中国医药公司直接发货。后经一再交涉，才确定由中国医药公司直接发货。但直到去年十一月底，零件还未运到，以致北京大学X光技师曾两次来绥远，因缺零件也无法把X光机安装起来，不能使机器为病人服务。去年年终，决算即将上报，绥远省人民医院不得已才又请求绥远省医药公司写介绍信，派专人去中国医药公司交涉，中国医药公司又把这部牛顿牌诊断机的主要零件调拨给天津市公司。绥远省人民医院的同志到天津市医药公司去要零件，该公司把这部机器应有的高压线适时摄影器零件等又估价为两亿元。绥远省人民医院原来以四亿七千万元就可买的机器，现在却要七亿元。绥远省若干病人一直不能用X光机治疗，这个损失是无法计算的。为了解决这个问题，天津市工商局给了绥远省人民医院很大的帮助。但问题到底什么时候才能得到解决呢，他们也不能回答。
    根据上述事实，完全可以说明中国医药公司及其所属的绥远省、天津市两公司，虽然经过“三反”运动，仍然存在着严重的官僚主义作风和市侩习气，他们这种作法，绝不能完成国营医药公司应该负担的供应任务，更无法发挥对私商的领导作用。建议中央商业部和人民检察机关注意检查中国医药公司的工作，并盼把这一事件作专案处理。
