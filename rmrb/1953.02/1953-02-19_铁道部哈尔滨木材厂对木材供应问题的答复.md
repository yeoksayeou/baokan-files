    Reply from the Harbin Timber Factory of the Ministry of Railways Regarding Timber Supply Issues

    A letter from Zhu Jianhong, Deputy Director of the Harbin Timber Factory of the Ministry of Railways: In the "Reader's Letters" column on October 25th of last year, reader Yan Runde criticized our Harbin Timber Factory of the Ministry of Railways (incorrectly referred to as the Northeast Timber Factory of the Ministry of Railways in the original letter) for not supplying timber according to the production needs of the Tianjin Railway Administration's Materials Department. We are now informing you of our self-criticism and reply.

    I. When our factory obtains timber from the Northeast Forestry Department, there are restrictions on specifications, which cannot fully meet the production needs of the railway department. To this end, our factory has repeatedly raised opinions to the Northeast Forestry Department, but the problem has not been resolved. In order to solve the problem of special specifications of timber needed for repairing trains, the Ministry of Railways has recently submitted a request to the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council, but has not yet received a reply. II. Our factory allocated railway sleepers to the Tianjin Railway Administration based on the plan of the Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways and the timber supply contract signed by both parties. The Tianjin Railway Administration did send a telegram two days before the timber was sent requesting that it not be sent. However, because our factory had already placed the order, paid the advance, and requested the train cars, we had to send all the sleepers.

    III. It is indeed true that many of the timber pieces allocated by our factory were rotten. The reason for this is that the factory leadership has not provided enough education to the employees, and some on-site personnel are still careless in their acceptance work. We guarantee that we will strengthen the ideological education of our employees in the future and strictly accept timber in accordance with the quality standards stipulated by the state.

### 铁道部哈尔滨木材厂对木材供应问题的答复

    铁道部哈尔滨木材厂对木材供应问题的答复
    铁道部哈尔滨木材厂副厂长朱剑虹来信：去年十月二十五日“读者来信专页”上，读者严润德对我们铁道部哈尔滨木材厂（原批评信中误为铁道部东北木材厂）不按天津铁路管理局材料处生产需要供应木材的问题提出了批评。现将我们的检讨和答复告诉你们。
    一、我厂向东北林业部领取木材时，规格有限制，不能完全合乎铁道部门生产需要。为此，我厂曾多次向东北林业部提出意见，但问题未得解决。为了解决修车需要的特殊规格的木材问题，铁道部最近已向政务院财政经济委员会请示，但尚未得到答复。二、我厂拨发枕木给天津铁路管理局是根据铁道部工务总局的计划和双方所订木材供应合同。在发送木材的前两天，天津铁路管理局确曾来电报要求不发。但因我厂已订了货、垫付了款、并要了车皮，只得把枕木发完。
    三、我厂所拨木材中有很多是腐朽的，这确是事实。其原因是我厂领导方面对职工教育不够，部分现场在验收工作中还有马虎从事的现象。我们保证今后要加强对职工的思想教育，严格地按照国家规定的质量标准验收木材。
