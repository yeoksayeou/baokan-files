    Do Not Casually Add New Lyrics to Revolutionary Songs
    Chen Lei's letter: The rapid literacy method has been promoted with a focus nationwide, and the work of eliminating illiteracy is being carried out. In the rapid literacy teaching process, in order to facilitate learning and increase confidence in learning, everyone is happy to sing some songs. These songs mostly use existing songs and add some new lyrics. In some places, even songs praising leaders and serious songs popular in the military have been used, which is very unserious. For example, in the "Rapid Literacy Songs" published by Shandong People's Publishing House and compiled by Chen Guangde, "Writing a Letter to Chairman Mao" uses the tune of "The East is Red"; "Opening Fire on the Fortress of Characters" uses the tune of "Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention"; "Cultural Great Leap Forward" uses the tune of "Northwest Peasants Sing of Chairman Mao". I think this approach is inappropriate.
    Shandong People's Publishing House Editorial Department's Self-Criticism
    After the People's Daily Literary Group forwarded reader Comrade Chen Lei's criticism of the book "Rapid Literacy Songs," published by our publishing house in November 1952, we convened a meeting of relevant editorial cadres to seriously examine and study it, and concluded that Comrade Chen Lei's criticism of the book was correct. The book does indeed commit the error of treating solemn revolutionary songs with an unserious attitude. Therefore, we sincerely accept Comrade Chen Lei's criticism and conduct a self-criticism and handling of the errors produced by the book.
    Some of these musical scores are scores of songs praising leaders, and some are scores of famous military songs, which not only have a high reputation among the people of our country, but some also enjoy a high international reputation. Our published book "Rapid Literacy Songs" borrows the scores of these songs with a frivolous attitude, directly damaging the dignity of these songs, which is wrong.
    The reason for the above error is that we lacked serious study and research on the commentary titled "Should Seriously Treat Solemn Revolutionary Songs" published by the People's Daily on June 2, 1952. We only thought that the criticism in this commentary referred to the abuse of solemn revolutionary songs in entertainment venues, dances, and funerals, and one-sidedly believed that rapid literacy learning was combative, and it was very convenient to use these songs familiar to the masses as tools to help learning; and also believed that the newly compiled lyrics were also serious, so we published them rashly without considering it. Especially when the book was reprinted, we still did not check it and printed another 7,000 copies (a total of 24,000 copies were published), repeating the error.
    Our publishing house, from top to bottom, will not only conduct a deep self-criticism, learn from the lessons, overcome bureaucracy, strengthen the study of policy documents, and change the unserious work style to ensure that this error does not happen again, but will also immediately stop publishing the book.
    Editor's note: Reader Comrade Chen Lei's criticism of the "Rapid Literacy Songs" published by Shandong People's Publishing House is correct. We agree with the Shandong People's Publishing House Editorial Department's self-criticism and handling opinions. In various political movements and production movements, it is quite common to casually fill in the tunes of the original revolutionary songs with new lyrics to match the local and current central tasks. This is an unserious and irresponsible attitude towards those songs with solemn content. This phenomenon should be thoroughly corrected. Propaganda and education departments in various places should encourage and organize musicians and the broad masses to actively create a large number of songs suitable for new content.

### 不要随便将革命歌曲配上新的歌词

专栏：读者来信摘要

    不要随便将革命歌曲配上新的歌词
    陈雷来信：在全国范围内已经有重点地推行速成识字法，展开扫除文盲工作。在速成识字教学过程中，为了便利学习，提高对学习的信心，大家都乐意唱一些歌曲。这些歌曲，大都是利用现有的歌曲，配一些新的歌词。有些地方，竟把歌颂领袖的歌曲和部队中流行的严肃的歌曲也用上了，这是很不严肃的。例如山东人民出版社出版、陈广德编的“速成识字歌曲”中，“亲笔写信给毛主席”是用“东方红”的曲子；“向文字碉堡开炮”是用“三大纪律八项注意”的曲子；“文化大翻身”是用“西北农民歌唱毛主席”的曲子。这种作法，我认为是不恰当的。
    山东人民出版社编辑部的检讨
    我社一九五二年十一月出版的“速成识字歌曲”一书，经人民日报文艺组转来读者陈雷同志的批评意见后，我们曾召开有关编辑干部会议，认真加以检查研究，认为陈雷同志对该书的批评是对的。该书确实犯有以不严肃的态度对待庄严的革命歌曲的错误。因此，我们诚恳接受陈雷同志的批评，并对该书所产生的错误进行检讨与处理。
    这些曲谱，有的是歌颂领袖的歌曲曲谱，有的是有名的军歌的曲谱，不但在我国人民中具有高度威望，有的且享有高度的国际威望。我们出版的“速成识字歌曲”一书，以轻率的态度借用这些歌曲的曲谱，直接损害了这些歌曲的尊严，是错误的。
    所以产生上述错误，是由于我们对人民日报在一九五二年六月二日发表的题为“应严肃对待庄严的革命歌曲”的评论，缺乏认真学习研究。我们仅仅以为这一评论所批评的，是指那些在娱乐场合、舞会以及婚丧时对庄严革命歌曲的滥用，片面地认为速成识字法学习是具有战斗性的，利用这些群众熟悉的歌曲作为工具帮助学习是很方便的；又认为新编的歌词也是严肃的，因此，便不加考虑，轻率出版。尤其在该书再版时，我们依然未作检查，又印了七千册（共出版了二万四千册），重复了错误。
    我社自上而下除作深刻检讨，接受教训，克服官僚主义，加强政策文件学习，转变不严肃的工作作风，保证这种错误不再发生外，对该书即予停版。
    编者按：读者陈雷同志对山东人民出版社出版的“速成识字歌曲”的批评是正确的。我们同意山东人民出版社编辑部的检讨及处理意见。在各种政治运动和生产运动中，随便地用原来的革命歌曲的曲调填上新的歌词以配合当地当时的中心任务的情况，是相当普遍的。这是对于那些具有庄严内容的歌曲，采取了不严肃、不负责的态度。这种现象应当彻底纠正。各地宣传教育部门，应该鼓励和组织音乐工作者和广大群众积极地创作出大量适合于新的内容的歌曲来。
