The heroic Filipino people have been waging a just national liberation war for more than a decade against the enslavement of imperialism and its running dogs, and for national independence and freedom.

During World War II, Japanese fascists defeated the US troops stationed in the Philippines led by MacArthur, and American colonialists and MacArthur himself fled in a panic. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of the Philippines, the Filipino people took up the weapons abandoned by the US military and established the Philippine People's Anti-Japanese Army on March 29, 1942, in central Luzon Island, persisting in anti-Japanese guerrilla warfare. In nearly 2,000 battles, the Philippine People's Anti-Japanese Army annihilated more than 25,000 Japanese and puppet troops, and strengthened its own ranks in the struggle, establishing anti-Japanese democratic regimes in central Luzon.

In the winter of 1944, the US military returned to the Philippines. The Philippine People's Anti-Japanese Army contained the Japanese troops stationed on various islands and cooperated with the US military to capture Ormoc City, the only Japanese stronghold on the west coast, and other key areas. The US imperialists, who were bent on restoring their colonial regime, regarded the meritorious Philippine People's Anti-Japanese Armed Forces as a thorn in their side. MacArthur took on the role of suppressing the Philippine national liberation movement. He declared the Philippine People's Anti-Japanese Army an "illegal organization," suddenly disarmed it, and disbanded the democratic regimes in the anti-Japanese guerrilla areas of central Luzon. In order to suppress the Filipino people's struggle for independence, US imperialism adopted the vicious policy of using Filipinos to fight Filipinos. Through the farce of granting the Philippines "independence" in July 1946, US imperialism used the traitorous Filipino clique of Roxas and Quirino, cultivated through colonial police and Filipino traitorous politicians, landlord armed forces, and rogue gangsters, to be the vanguard in "mopping up" the anti-Japanese army. However, their so-called "all-out offensives" were all crushed by the Philippine People's Anti-Japanese Army. In 1949, the Philippine People's Anti-Japanese Army was officially renamed the Philippine People's Liberation Army. They constantly seized the Quirino puppet army's "American equipment" to arm themselves, and in the struggle, they developed and strengthened their own ranks.

In 1950, the Philippine People's Liberation Army launched three large-scale offensives in March, April, and late August, dealing a severe blow to the Quirino puppet army. Anderson, the head of the US "Military Mission" stationed in the Philippines to command the Quirino puppet army, and Connelio, the Minister of National Defense of the Philippine puppet government, were therefore dismissed.

After launching the Korean War, the US aggressors strengthened their aggression against the Philippines and drove the Quirino puppet army to carry out "sweeps" of the Philippine liberated areas time and time again. But despite this, the Philippine People's Armed Forces, which were warmly loved by the broad masses of the Filipino people, not only persisted victoriously but also continued to develop. Now, in the liberated areas of Pampanga, Tarlac, Nueva Ecija, and Bulacan provinces, people's governments elected by the people have been established, land reform has been implemented, the land of American colonialists and landlords has been confiscated and distributed to the peasants, and agricultural production cooperatives led by agricultural labor models have been established. The anti-illiteracy campaign has also been vigorously carried out in the Philippine liberated areas, various schools have been universally established, so that workers and peasants have obtained opportunities to study cultural and technical knowledge, and "Stalin University," "People's University," and "People's Military and Political University" have been established to train cadres of the Party, the army, and the people's government.

The Philippine People's Liberation Army has won the support of the broad masses of the people. The "Spark," "Liberation," and "Communist" monthly magazines published by the Communist Party of the Philippines and the Philippine People's Liberation Army, as well as various propaganda documents and leaflets, are widely circulated among the people in cities and villages.

Under the brutal rule of US imperialism and the Quirino traitorous clique, the Filipino people live a very painful life. According to official, clearly understated figures, the Philippine consumer price index in 1951 increased by 5 percent compared to 1949, while workers' monetary wages decreased by 7 percent; that is to say, in two years, the real wages of Filipino workers decreased by another 11.5 percent. According to a report on the Philippine rural situation issued by the US Mutual Security Agency, more than two-thirds of the tenant farmers and laborers in rural areas have no land. The wages of laborers are completely insecure. The number of unemployed and semi-unemployed people in the Philippines has reached 4 million, accounting for more than one-fifth of the entire Philippine population. Under the instigation of US imperialism, the Quirino traitorous clique murdered trade union leaders, set up concentration camps to imprison patriots, suppressed peasant movements with brutal methods of collective slaughter, and condoned the puppet military police and landlord armed forces to commit countless crimes. The bloody rule of the Quirino clique has aroused widespread dissatisfaction among the Filipino people. In the cities, workers often strike. In the countryside, the report on the Philippine rural situation issued by the US Mutual Security Agency also had to admit that the peasants, who account for four-fifths of the entire Philippine population, have lost all confidence in the Quirino puppet government.

US imperialists are trying to use the Philippines as a military base to control Southeast Asia and a source of cannon fodder for aggressive wars. Since October 1952, the United States has successively sent important heads of the Department of Defense, Foster, Mrs. Rosenberg, and Olmsted, to the Philippines to extort cannon fodder for the war of aggression against Korea from the Quirino clique. However, right near Clark Air Base, the most important US base in the Philippines, the Philippine People's Liberation Army frequently launches attacks. The armed struggle of the Filipino people has made the Quirino puppet army exhausted, unable to transfer a large number of troops to meet the US imperialists' demand for cannon fodder.

The victorious struggle of the Filipino people against the US colonialists and the Quirino traitorous clique powerfully proves that the strength of the US imperialists and their running dogs in the Philippines is very weak. The Filipino people's struggle for national independence and freedom is bound to be victorious. Hardy, a "expert" sent to the Philippines by the US Mutual Security Agency, had to admit in his report on the Philippine land tenancy system at the end of last year that the armed resistance of the Filipino people "threatens the survival of the Republic of the Philippines and the position of the United States in the Pacific." "This spirit of resistance, nurtured by years of poverty and struggle, cannot be suppressed by force, nor can it be pacified by appeasement."

### 菲律宾人民为争取民族独立自由而斗争

    菲律宾人民为争取民族独立自由而斗争
    英勇的菲律宾人民为反对帝国主义及其走狗的奴役统治，为争取民族独立、自由而进行的正义的民族解放战争，已经坚持了十年以上了。
    在第二次世界大战中，日本法西斯打败了麦克阿瑟率领的驻菲美军，美国殖民者和麦克阿瑟本人都慌忙逃跑了。菲律宾人民在菲律宾共产党领导下，拿起了美军遗弃的武器，一九四二年三月二十九日在吕宋岛中部成立了菲律宾人民抗日军，坚持抗日游击战争。在近二千次的战斗中，菲律宾人民抗日军歼灭了日伪军二万五千多人，并在斗争中壮大了自己的队伍，在吕宋中部建立了抗日民主政权。
    一九四四年冬，美军重回菲律宾。菲律宾人民抗日军牵制了驻守各岛的日本军队，并配合美军攻下了日军在西海岸的唯一据点欧尔摩克城及其它要地。一心要恢复殖民地政权的美帝国主义者把功劳卓著的菲律宾人民抗日武装当作眼中钉。麦克阿瑟担任了扼杀菲律宾民族解放运动的角色。他宣布菲律宾人民抗日军是“非法组织”，突然进行缴械，并解散吕宋中部抗日游击区的民主政权。为了镇压菲律宾人民争取独立的斗争，美帝国主义采取了用菲律宾人打菲律宾人的恶毒政策。美帝国主义通过一九四六年七月赐给菲律宾“独立”的丑剧，利用殖民警察和菲律宾的卖国政客、地主武装和流氓恶棍等主演的伪选举，把罗哈斯、季里诺的菲奸集团扶植起来，驱使他们作“扫荡”抗日军的先锋。但是他们所发动的所谓“全面进攻”，都一一被菲律宾人民抗日军所粉碎了。一九四九年，菲律宾人民抗日军正式改名为菲律宾人民解放军。他们不断夺取季里诺傀儡军的“美式装备”来武装自己，并在斗争中发展壮大了自己的队伍。
    一九五○年，菲律宾人民解放军在三月、四月和八月的下旬展开了三次大规模的出击，给予季里诺傀儡军以严重打击。美国派驻菲律宾指挥季里诺傀儡军的美国“军事代表团”团长安德逊和菲律宾傀儡政府的国防部部长康利容都因此而被撤职。
    美国侵略者在发动朝鲜战争之后，加强了它对菲律宾的侵略，并驱使季里诺傀儡军对菲律宾解放区进行了一次又一次的“扫荡”。但是，尽管如此，获得菲律宾广大人民热诚爱戴的菲律宾人民武装力量，不但在胜利地坚持着，而且仍然在发展着。现在，在邦邦牙、丹辘、新怡西夏和武捞干等省的解放区里，已经建立了经过人民选举的人民政府，实行了土地改革，没收了美国殖民者和地主的土地分配给农民，并建立了由农业劳动模范领导的农业生产合作社。菲律宾解放区里还大力开展了扫除文盲的运动，普遍设立了各种学校，使工人和农民都获得了学习文化和技术知识的机会，还开办了“斯大林大学”、“人民大学”、“人民军政大学”来训练党、军队和人民政府的干部。
    菲律宾人民解放军获得了广大人民的拥护。菲律宾共产党和菲律宾人民解放军出版的“火星报”和“解放”、“共产党人”等月刊以及各种宣传文件和传单都在城市和乡村的人民群众中广泛流传。
    在美帝国主义和季里诺卖国集团残酷统治下的菲律宾人民，过着十分痛苦的生活。根据官方显然低估的数字，一九五一年菲律宾消费品价格指数比一九四九年增加了百分之五，而工人货币工资却减少了百分之七；这就是说：在两年中菲律宾工人的实际工资又降低了百分之十一点五。据美国共同安全署发表的菲律宾农村情况报告中承认：占农村人口三分之二以上的佃农和雇工都没有土地。雇工的工资完全没有保障。菲律宾失业和半失业人数已达四百万人，占菲律宾全人口的五分之一以上。在美帝国主义指使下，季里诺卖国集团杀害工会领袖，设立集中营来囚禁爱国分子，用集体屠杀的残暴手段来镇压农民运动，纵容傀儡军警和地主武装犯下数不清的罪行。季里诺集团的血腥统治已引起了菲律宾人民的普遍不满。在城市里，工人常常罢工。在农村，美国共同安全署发表的菲律宾农村情况报告中也不得不承认，占菲律宾全人口五分之四的农民对季里诺傀儡政府丧失了一切信心。
    美帝国主义者力图把菲律宾作为控制东南亚的军事基地和侵略战争的炮灰取给地。从一九五二年十月以来，美国接连派遣了国防部重要头子福斯特、罗森堡夫人和奥姆斯特德等人到菲律宾向季里诺集团勒索侵朝炮灰。然而，就在美国在菲律宾的最重要据点克拉克基地附近，菲律宾人民解放军就经常出击。菲律宾人民的武装斗争，使得季里诺傀儡军疲于奔命，没法大量抽调兵力来应付美帝国主义的炮灰需求。
    菲律宾人民反对美国殖民者和季里诺卖国集团的胜利斗争，有力地证明：美帝国主义者及其在菲律宾的走狗的力量，是十分脆弱的。菲律宾人民争取民族独立自由的斗争，是必然要获得胜利的。美国共同安全署派到菲律宾的“专家”哈迪在去年底发表的菲律宾土地租佃制度问题的报告书也不得不承认：菲律宾人民的武装反抗“威胁着菲律宾共和国的生存和美国在太平洋的地位”。“这种由于经历多年的贫困和斗争所养成的反抗精神，不是武力所能打下去的，也不是怀柔政策所能平息的。”
