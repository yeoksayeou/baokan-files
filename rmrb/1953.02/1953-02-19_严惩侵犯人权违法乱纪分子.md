    Severely Punish Lawless Elements Who Violate Human Rights

    The incident in which Chang Guanghua, Deputy Director of the Hefei Municipal Public Security Bureau in Anhui Province, condoned his subordinates in the public security organs to insult performers, disrupt theaters, and even abuse their authority to arbitrarily arrest and detain cadres of the Experimental Theater, demonstrates that the criminal behavior of certain public security personnel in Hefei in violating laws and discipline and oppressing the masses has developed to an extremely serious degree. In order to strictly enforce the law and protect the legitimate rights of performers, the Hefei Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has decided to expel Chang Guanghua from the Party, and the Hefei Municipal People's Government has decided to remove him from his post and bring him to justice. This handling is entirely necessary and correct.

    Chang Guanghua is a leading cadre of the public security organs and a Communist Party member. Instead of earnestly educating his subordinates who violated the law and failing to give them a stern punishment, he adopted the wrong attitude of condoning and supporting them, and even abused his authority to infringe upon human rights by casually detaining working cadres of the theater. This is a remnant of the vile work style left over from the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang.

    The case of Chang Guanghua and others violating laws and discipline and infringing upon human rights exposes the contemptuous attitude of some public security organ cadres towards the arts and art workers: Public security personnel who cannot buy tickets can break into the theater and arbitrarily disrupt order; when checking household registrations, they can arbitrarily insult actors and arrest actors; and the deputy director of the public security bureau can arbitrarily "handcuff the theater's political instructor and send him to jail." What difference is there between this behavior and the vile behavior of Kuomintang reactionary police officers watching free shows, smashing theaters, and insulting actors? However, certain Party and government leaders in Anhui Province did not profoundly recognize the seriousness of this incident, and failed to handle it in a timely manner in accordance with the policies of the Party and the People's Government; at the forum, they actually dealt with this case with an attitude of "giving each side fifty lashes." This is actually condoning the law-breaking public security personnel, and it also reflects their indifference to the people's art.

    This lawless behavior of some public security personnel in Hefei is not an isolated phenomenon. In some areas, due to the lack of clear management systems for opera theaters and troupes by the local cultural authorities, or even the complete abandonment of leadership, allowing them to drift freely, the public security organs can arbitrarily interfere with the troupes and theaters. Some cadres ideologically despise performers, and instead of adopting a patient attitude of unity and education towards them, they adopt a coercive and crude attitude, and even act recklessly regardless of policy. This situation seriously affects the lives and performances of performers and affects the development of opera work. This is not permissible. The leading organs of public security departments in various localities should conduct ideological education for their subordinates through this incident to ensure that similar incidents do not occur again.

### 严惩侵犯人权违法乱纪分子

    严惩侵犯人权违法乱纪分子
    安徽省合肥市公安局副局长常光华纵容所属公安人员侮蔑艺人，扰乱剧场，甚至滥用职权，任意逮捕拘押实验剧场干部的事件，说明了合肥市某些公安人员违法乱纪、欺压群众的罪恶行为已经发展到极为严重的地步。为了严整法纪，保护艺人应有的权利，中共合肥市委会决定开除常光华的党籍，合肥市人民政府决定撤销他的职务并加以法办。这样处理是完全必要的、正确的。
    常光华是公安机关的领导干部，且为共产党员，对于所属违法人员，不仅不认真进行教育，不给以严正处分，反而采取了纵容和支持的错误态度，甚至滥用职权，侵犯人权，随便拘押剧场的工作干部。这是国民党反动统治所遗留下来的恶劣作风的残余。
    常光华等违法乱纪侵犯人权的案件，暴露了某些公安机关干部对于艺术事业和艺术工作者的轻视态度：公安人员买票买不到，可以闯进剧场，任意破坏秩序；查户口时可以任意侮辱演员，逮捕演员；公安局副局长可以任意将剧场政治指导员“铐起来送到牢里去”。这种行为，和国民党反动派警察老爷们看白戏，打剧场、侮辱演员的恶劣行为，有什么两样呢？但是安徽省某些党政领导干部没有深刻认识这一事件的严重性，不按照党和人民政府的政策及时加以处理；他们在座谈会上竟以双方“各打五十大板”的态度来处理这个案件。这在实际上是对犯法的公安人员的纵容，同时也反映了他们对人民艺术事业的漠视。
    合肥市部分公安人员这种违法乱纪的行为，并不是个别现象。有些地区，由于当地的文化主管机关对于戏曲剧场和剧团缺乏明确的管理制度，或是根本放弃领导，听其自流，以致公安机关对剧团剧场可以任意干涉。有些干部在思想上轻视艺人，对艺人不是采取耐心的团结教育的态度，而是采取强迫命令的粗暴态度，甚至不顾政策，胡作非为。这种情况严重地影响了艺人的生活和演出，影响了戏曲工作的发展。这是不能容许的。各地公安部门的领导机关应该通过这个事件，对所属干部进行思想教育，保证类似事件不再发生。
