Supplementary Directive of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the Work of the Marriage Law Implementation Campaign Month
(February 18, 1953)

The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government issued directives on the implementation of the Marriage Law on November 26, 1952, and February 1, 1953, respectively, stipulating that March 1953 would be the Marriage Law Implementation Campaign Month. During this campaign month, a vigorous campaign to publicize the Marriage Law and inspect its implementation should be launched throughout the country (excluding minority areas and areas where land reform has not yet been completed) to create a good start for the continued implementation of the Marriage Law in the future. Now that March is approaching, party committees at all levels must actively prepare in accordance with these two directives, and at the same time urge governments and people's organizations at all levels to carry out various preparations so as to resolutely and correctly carry out this campaign.

In preparation for this campaign month, some key experiments have been conducted in various places. The results of these experiments have proved the following two points: on the one hand, the publicity and implementation of the Marriage Law are extremely uneven across the country; in many places, not only the people, but also many Communist Party members and government workers, have not been seriously and correctly publicized and educated, and they still do not understand or have many misunderstandings about the Marriage Law and this Marriage Law Implementation Campaign, and even have resistance. However, once serious and correct publicity, education and inspection are carried out, the understanding of these cadres and the masses will change significantly. It is therefore clear that it is entirely necessary to adopt the method of the Marriage Law Implementation Campaign Month to launch publicity of the Marriage Law and inspection of its implementation; it is completely wrong to adopt a passive and skeptical attitude towards this. On the other hand, some cadres underestimate the power of feudal ideas and customs left over from the old society's marriage system. They hold impatient sentiments, attempting to solve all problems in a short period of time or in one campaign, and mistakenly apply methods such as "struggle meetings," "confession meetings," and even "household investigations," "family comparisons," "division of battle lines," and "family alignment" to solve problems, or expand the Marriage Law Implementation Campaign to general male-female relationships and family relationships, thereby causing certain social chaos and endangering the campaign's deviation from the correct track and prescribed goals. This is also wrong and must be prevented and corrected.

Lenin said, "The force of habit of millions is a most terrible force." Marriage and family issues involve every family and every individual. Feudal ideas and feudal habits in this area are something that has been deeply rooted in people's minds for thousands of years. This cannot be "eliminated" in a short period of time by crude methods, but must be gradually eliminated through continuous publicity and education work (including punishing a very small number of serious criminals) over a long period of time. The purpose of this Marriage Law Implementation Campaign Month is to universally carry out this publicity and education work, systematically criticize old ideas, old systems, and old habits on marriage issues, and establish positions for new ideas, new systems, and new customs, so that cadres and the masses can draw a clear ideological line on the issue of the old and new marriage systems.

In order to ensure that the work of this campaign month can be carried out effectively and without causing any confusion, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China hereby issues the following supplementary instructions:

1.  During the Marriage Law Implementation Campaign Month, except for proactively investigating and dealing with extremely few serious criminals among the people who have committed murder and injury due to interfering with freedom of marriage and abusing women, the focus should be on publicizing the Marriage Law among the general public. The inspection of the implementation of the Marriage Law should be limited to party committees at all levels, county, district, and township (village) cadres, courts above the county level, and personnel in civil affairs departments in charge of marriage affairs, and should not be carried out among the general public. In order to ensure that the campaign is carried out in a prepared and step-by-step manner, local staff should generally first study the Marriage Law and inspect their own implementation of the Marriage Law, then widely publicize the Marriage Law to the people, and inspect and deal with extremely few serious criminals.

2.  The above-mentioned cadres' study of the Marriage Law should involve detailed study of the full text at the county level and above, and should be conducted separately in various departments; at the district and township (village) level, the focus should be on studying the basic principles of the Marriage Law and the Marriage Law Propaganda Outline (to be published soon), and should be concentrated in district-level organs, under the guidance of county-level responsible cadres. After studying, the above-mentioned cadres should conduct inspections on the following items: (1) Have you studied the Marriage Law in the past? Do you understand it? Do you agree with it? Do you understand it and agree with it after studying it now? (2) In the past, when dealing with the people's marriage and family problems, did you correctly implement the provisions of the Marriage Law? (3) Have you ever interfered with the freedom of marriage of others? (4) Have you ever failed to rescue women who were persecuted, failed to ask about their deaths, or even participated in the persecution? During the inspection, personnel who have correctly implemented the Marriage Law should be commended; those who have made general mistakes in implementation should be criticized and corrected; those who insist on their mistakes and refuse to correct them should be given appropriate administrative sanctions; serious criminals who directly participated in the persecution of women should be handed over to the People's Court for punishment according to law. This inspection is limited to the items listed above, and should not involve these cadres' personal marriage problems and male-female relationship problems, so as not to confuse the goals of the campaign and hinder the correct development of the campaign. If these cadres have violated the provisions of the Marriage Law in their own marriage problems, they should be handled by the People's Court in accordance with the law, just like the general public, and should not be handled by party committees at all levels and other organs. In addition to the above-mentioned cadres who should study the Marriage Law and inspect its implementation, other general organs, troops, and schools should also hold reports on the Marriage Law during the Marriage Law Implementation Campaign Month.

3.  The main way to publicize the Marriage Law to the people should be for pre-prepared reporters or other selected and trained personnel to give reports on the implementation of the Marriage Law to all residents or all the masses in urban and rural grassroots units. These report meetings should be convened in batches in a way that is convenient for the masses, and the masses should not be forced to attend. At the same time, party propagandists and activists from various people's organizations should be organized to carry out led propaganda and explanation work, and wall newspapers, blackboards, loudspeakers, cultural stations, cultural centers, drama troupes, folk artists, slide projection teams, film projection teams, cinemas, radio stations, newspapers, etc. should be mobilized to cooperate. The content of the publicity should focus on the following points: (1) Explain the harm of the old marriage system and the benefits of the new marriage system, and call on men, women, old and young to unite and consciously and voluntarily support the Marriage Law. When criticizing the old marriage system, do not generally criticize local people by name; but when publicizing the new marriage system, you can commend model figures who are independent in marriage, harmonious in family, active in production, and progressive in politics. (2) Explain that the implementation of the Marriage Law is not to break up family relationships established by the old marriage system, nor is it to promote divorce. Even if their past marriages do not comply with the provisions of the Marriage Law, as long as the parties do not make a firm request for divorce, no one should interfere with them or force them to divorce. However, it should be emphasized that undemocratic and disharmonious families should improve husband-wife and mother-in-law relationships to make them democratic and harmonious families; for a very small number of couples whose relationship is very bad and cannot continue to maintain it after mediation, divorce should be granted. If people in the masses request mediation of family relationships, work groups and cadres should do their best to help improve their relationships; if there are cases that should be handled by the People's Court, they should be handled by the People's Court in accordance with the law at the request of the parties, and should not be handled by work groups or other cadres instead of the court. (3) Strictly prohibit killing or injuring women. Women, whether married or unmarried, whether satisfied with their husbands or parents-in-law, whether they want a divorce or not, and whatever their shortcomings, must have their lives and bodies protected equally, and no one is allowed to kill or injure them. Whoever kills and injures women is breaking the law and will be punished by the government. Whoever kills someone must pay with their life. (4) Call on cadres and the people to respect active revolutionary soldiers and retired revolutionary disabled soldiers, protect their marriages and families, and oppose anyone who destroys them. Other complex issues regarding marriage and family relationships should not be promoted casually during the campaign month, and no incorrect and irresponsible answers should be given casually.

4.  All Communist Party members must be active in publicizing the Marriage Law and the Party's marriage policy. In all publicity, daily speeches, and practical work in dealing with the masses' marriage problems, Party members must abide by the principles and provisions of the Marriage Law and must not violate or distort them. The Central Committee has given clear instructions on this point in its April 30, 1950, Notice to the Whole Party on Guaranteeing the Implementation of the Marriage Law. However, in the past three years, many Party members have violated the Central Committee's instructions, not only failing to actively and correctly publicize the Marriage Law to the masses, failing to criticize erroneous opinions against the Marriage Law, but also often violating the Party's instructions and state laws in their words and actions to maintain the feudal marriage system. This is completely unacceptable and violates the Party Constitution and Party discipline. In the future, if any Party member adopts this erroneous attitude again, they must be subject to disciplinary action.

5.  Marriage cases involving the people and cadres should be handled by the district people's government or the county and city people's courts in accordance with normal legal procedures. Work cadres of marriage law implementation committees at all levels and their work groups, work cadres of women's federations and other people's organizations at all levels, Communist Party members and members of the Communist Youth League should support women who have been severely persecuted and help them file lawsuits with the People's Court. District people's governments and people's courts at all levels should immediately and seriously handle appeals for freedom of marriage and accusations of interference with freedom of marriage and abuse of women, and should never allow any laissez-faire and procrastinationist bureaucratic attitudes. In order to ensure that the People's Courts at all levels can correctly and quickly handle marriage cases during and after the campaign month, and to ensure that district and township people's governments can correctly handle marriage registration, higher-level party committees and people's governments must immediately transfer and train a group of cadres with correct views to serve as judges in marriage issues and marriage registration work, or train existing personnel so that they fully understand the Marriage Law and can faithfully and correctly implement it. Personnel who still cannot correctly perform their tasks after education should be replaced.

6.  The implementation of the Marriage Law involves a very wide range and extremely complex issues. Therefore, party committees at all levels must firmly grasp the leadership of this campaign, especially maintain close contact with the countryside. If confusion and biases are found, they must be overcome at any time, and the campaign must be temporarily suspended if necessary. In places where manpower is insufficient, it is better to temporarily reduce the scope of publicity to the masses with the approval of the higher level, so as to gain experience and gradually promote it, rather than letting impatient and adventurous tendencies develop freely. If the campaign is not carried out well in some places in March and is stopped or reduced in scope or not completed midway, it should be continued after March. After the Marriage Law Implementation Campaign Month has passed, party committees at all levels should set out practical measures to ensure that the implementation of the Marriage Law is treated as a regular task in the future.

### 中国共产党中央委员会  关于贯彻婚姻法运动月工作的补充指示

    中国共产党中央委员会
    关于贯彻婚姻法运动月工作的补充指示
    （一九五三年二月十八日）
    中共中央和中央人民政府政务院在一九五二年十一月二十六日和一九五三年二月一日分别发出了关于贯彻婚姻法的指示，规定以一九五三年三月为贯彻婚姻法运动月，在这个运动月中，要大张旗鼓地在全国范围内（少数民族地区和土地改革尚未完成地区除外）开展一个宣传婚姻法和检查婚姻法执行情况的运动，以为今后继续贯彻婚姻法的工作造成良好的开端。现在三月就要到来，各级党委必须根据这两个指示，积极准备，同时督促各级人民政府和人民团体进行各项准备，以便坚决地正确地进行这个运动。
    为了准备这个运动月的工作，各地曾经进行了一些重点试验。这些试验的结果证明了以下两点，即：一方面，全国各地对于婚姻法的宣传和执行的情况是极不平衡的；在很多地方，不但是人民群众，而且有不少的共产党员和政府工作人员，由于没有对他们进行认真的正确的宣传教育和检查，他们对于婚姻法和这次贯彻婚姻法的运动还很不了解或有很多误解，甚至还有抗拒的情绪，而一经认真地正确地进行了宣传教育和检查之后，这些干部和群众的认识就有了显著的改变。由此可见，采取贯彻婚姻法运动月的办法去展开婚姻法的宣传和检查婚姻法执行的情况，是完全必要的；对此采取消极和怀疑的态度，是完全错误的。但是在另一方面，又有一部分干部对于旧社会遗留下来的婚姻制度上的封建思想和封建习惯的力量估计不足，他们抱着急躁的情绪，企图在短期内或一次运动中解决一切问题，并且错误地搬用“斗争会”、“坦白会”以至“户户调查”、“家家评比”、“划分阵线”、“家庭站队”等办法来解决问题，或者把贯彻婚姻法运动扩大到一般的男女关系和家庭关系方面去，从而引起了社会上的某些混乱，并有使运动脱离正确轨道和规定目标的危险。这也是错误的，必须加以防止和纠正的。
    列宁说，“千百万人的习惯的势力乃是一种最可怕的势力。”婚姻和家庭的问题是牵涉到每个家庭每个人的问题，在这方面的封建思想和封建习惯，是几千年来根深蒂固地存在于人们思想意识中的一种东西。这是决不能在短期内采用粗暴的办法去加以“消灭”的，而必须是在很长时间内不断地进行宣传教育工作（包括惩处极少数严重犯罪分子），才能逐步地加以清除。这次贯彻婚姻法运动月的目的，就是要普遍地进行这个宣传教育工作，在婚姻问题上系统地批驳旧思想、旧制度和旧习惯，并且树立新思想、新制度和新风气的阵地，使干部和人民群众在新旧婚姻制度问题上划清思想界限。
    为了保证这个运动月的工作能够有力地开展，又不致发生任何混乱现象起见，中共中央特作如下的补充指示：
    一、在贯彻婚姻法运动月中，除对人民群众中极少数因干涉婚姻自由、虐待妇女而致杀害人命、伤害人身的严重犯罪分子应主动地加以检查处理外，对一般人民群众应以进行婚姻法的宣传为限。关于婚姻法执行情况的检查，只限于在各级党委及县区乡（村）干部、县以上各级法院和民政部门主管婚姻事务的人员中进行，而不要在一般人民群众中去进行。为使运动进行得有准备有步骤起见，各地工作人员一般地应首先学习婚姻法并检查自己执行婚姻法情况，然后向人民群众广泛宣传婚姻法，并检查处理极少数严重犯罪分子。
    二、上述干部对于婚姻法的学习，在县级和县以上各级应详细学习全文，并应在各机关分别进行；在区乡（村）则应着重学习婚姻法的基本原则和婚姻法宣传提纲（不日公布），并应集中在区级机关，在县级负责干部指导下进行。上述干部在学习后应就以下各项进行检查：（一）对婚姻法过去是否学习过？是否了解？是否赞成？现在学习后是否了解？是否赞成？（二）过去在处理群众有关婚姻和家庭问题时，是否正确地执行了婚姻法的规定？（三）是否干涉过别人的婚姻自由？（四）对于受迫害的妇女，有无见危不救、死了不问甚至参与迫害的行为？在检查中，对正确地执行了婚姻法的人员应加以表扬；对执行中犯了一般错误的，应加以批评和纠正；对坚持错误拒不改正的，应给以适当的行政处分；对于直接参与迫害妇女的严重犯罪分子，应交人民法院依法惩处。这种检查限于以上所列各项，而不应牵入到这些干部的个人婚姻问题和男女关系问题中去，以免混乱运动的目标，妨碍运动的正确开展。如果这些干部在自己的婚姻问题上有违反婚姻法规定者，也应同一般人民群众一样由人民法院依法处理，而不应由各级党委和其他机关处理。除开上述干部应该学习婚姻法并检查其执行情况外，其他一般的机关、部队和学校，在贯彻婚姻法运动月中也应当举行关于婚姻法的报告。
    三、向人民群众进行婚姻法宣传的主要方式，应当是由预先准备好的报告员或其他经过选择训练的工作人员向城乡基层单位的全体居民或全体群众作关于贯彻婚姻法问题的报告。这种报告会应采取便利群众的分批召集的方式，不得强迫群众到会。同时应组织党的宣传员和各个人民团体的积极分子作有领导的宣传解释工作，并动员墙报、黑板报、广播筒、文化站、文化馆、剧团、民间艺人、幻灯放映队、电影放映队、电影院、广播台、报纸等加以配合。宣传内容应着重下列各点：（一）说明旧婚姻制度的害处，新婚姻制度的好处，号召男女老少团结起来，自觉自动地拥护婚姻法。在批判旧婚姻制度时，一般地不要对当地群众指名批评；但在宣传新婚姻制度时，则可表扬婚姻自主、家庭和睦、生产积极、政治进步的模范人物。（二）说明实行婚姻法并不是要拆散由旧婚姻制度建立起来的家庭关系，并不是要提倡离婚，他们过去的婚姻即使不合婚姻法的规定，只要当事人不提出离婚的坚决要求，谁也不应当去干涉他们，强迫他们离婚。但是要强调指出：不民主不和睦的家庭应当改善夫妻婆媳关系，使之成为民主和睦的家庭；对于极少数夫妇关系十分恶劣、经过调解仍无法继续维持者，应准予离婚。人民群众中如有要求调解家庭关系者，工作组和干部应尽力帮助，改善他们的关系；其中如有应由人民法院处理的案件，都应在当事人要求之下依法到人民法院去处理，而不要由工作组或其他干部代替法院去处理。（三）严格禁止杀害或伤害妇女。妇女无论已婚未婚，无论与丈夫、公婆是否互相满意，无论是否要求离婚，无论有什么缺点，她们的生命和身体都必须一律受到保护，绝对不许任何人加以杀害或伤害。谁要是杀害和伤害妇女，谁就是犯了法，就一定受到政府的惩办。谁杀了人就要抵命。（四）号召干部和人民群众敬爱现役革命军人和退役革命残废军人，保护他们的婚姻和家庭，反对任何人加以破坏。其他关于婚姻和家庭关系的复杂问题，不要在运动月中随便宣传，不要随便作不正确不负责的解答。四、全体共产党员必须是宣传婚姻法和党的婚姻政策的积极分子。党员在有关婚姻问题的一切宣传中、日常言论中以及处理群众婚姻问题的实际工作中，必须遵守婚姻法的原则和规定，不得违反或歪曲。中央在一九五○年四月三十日关于保证执行婚姻法给全党的通知中，对于这一点已有明确指示。但三年来还有不少党员违背中央的指示，不但不向群众积极地正确地宣传婚姻法，对反对婚姻法的错误意见不加批判，而且自己也常常在言论上和行动上违背党的指示和国家法令去维护封建的婚姻制度。这是完全不能容许的，违背党章和党的纪律的。今后如有党员再采取这种错误态度，必须受到纪律的处分。
    五、人民群众和干部中的婚姻案件，应当按照正常的法律手续，由区人民政府或县、市人民法院加以处理。各级贯彻婚姻法运动委员会及其工作组、各级民主妇联和其他人民团体的工作干部、共产党员和青年团员，应当支持受到严重迫害的妇女，帮助她们向人民法院提出控告。区人民政府和各级人民法院对于要求婚姻自由的申诉以及关于干涉婚姻自由、虐待妇女的控告应立即认真地处理，绝不容许采取任何放任拖延的官僚主义态度。为了保证在运动月中及以后各级人民法院能够正确地迅速地处理婚姻案件，保证区乡人民政府能够正确地办理婚姻登记，上级党委和人民政府必须立即抽调和训练一批观点正确的干部来担任婚姻问题的审判工作和婚姻登记工作，或将现有人员加以训练，使其完全了解婚姻法并能忠实而正确地加以执行。对于那些经过教育以后仍然不能正确地执行任务的人员，应加以撤换。
    六、贯彻婚姻法牵涉的范围极广，问题极复杂，因此各级党委必须抓紧对这次运动的领导，特别要和乡村密切联系，如发现混乱和偏向，必须随时克服，必要时并得暂时停止运动的进行。在人力不足的地方，宁可经过上级同意暂时缩小对群众宣传的范围，以求取得经验，逐步推广，而不要听任急躁冒险倾向自流发展。某些地方在三月间如因运动进行得不好而中途停止或缩小范围或没有完成，应在三月以后继续进行。在贯彻婚姻法运动月过去以后，各级党委应定出切实办法，保证把贯彻婚姻法工作当作今后的一项经常工作。
