The achievements of the mass "mechanization and automation" movement in the small rolling mill of the state-owned Anshan Iron and Steel Company have aroused great interest among the workers of various factories and mines in the company and some factories and mines in other regions. The workers of the factories and mines affiliated to the company have organized study visits to the small rolling mill. Many people, seeing the scenes of mechanized and automated production in the small rolling mill during the visit, praised:

"The work in the small rolling mill is so easy, you can produce by playing with the buttons!" They have carefully studied the improved parts related to their own work. Zhang Laifu, a worker at the medium rolling mill, kept asking the creator of the automatic steel turning machine in the small rolling mill questions for more than an hour. It turned out that he was studying a steel turning machine. After he understood the principle of the steel turning machine in the small rolling mill, he said happily: "I will refer to the structural principle of your steel turning machine to study, and I will definitely succeed." Many technicians have sketched various creations of the small rolling mill with pencils, preparing to use them as a reference when improving the equipment of their own factories. Cadres of the trade union and the Communist Youth League copied the significance and economic value of various creations of the small rolling mill from the diagrams and used them as propaganda materials for promoting the experience of the small rolling mill in their own factories and mines. After visiting, the responsible cadres of the factories and mines became more clear about the direction of mobilizing all employees, especially mobilizing veteran workers and technicians, to gradually transform the production process into mechanization and automation. The secretary of the Communist Party Committee of the ore dressing plant said: "The working conditions in our plant are also not good. After returning, we must mobilize the masses to use their brains and follow the road of the small rolling mill."

The rolling mills and machinery factories in Tangshan, Taiyuan, and Shenyang have successively sent people to the small rolling mill to study, or wrote letters to request the drawings of the "anti-collar disc." The Mechanical Eighth Factory and the Twenty-Second Factory under the Northeast Mechanical Administration Bureau are both led by the factory director or other responsible persons to conduct the "anti-collar disc" experiment, and both have been successfully tested. The steel produced by the Mechanical Eighth Factory using the "anti-collar disc" (6.5 mm) is finer than the steel produced by the Anshan Iron and Steel small rolling mill (the finer the steel, the more difficult it is to use the anti-collar disc), which further confirms the scientific nature of Zhang Mingshan's creation of the "anti-collar disc." The output and quality of the Mechanical Eighth Factory's rolling workshop have been significantly improved due to the installation of the "anti-collar disc"; and it has promoted the improvement of the equipment of the entire workshop, thus fundamentally improving the labor conditions. Wang Junbao, a draughtsman who used to be burned on his right leg by steel bars when working as a rolling worker, said: "If there had been an 'anti-collar disc' earlier, my leg would not have been pulled off."

    鞍山、唐山和太原等地许多工厂的职工
    积极学习鞍钢小型轧钢厂生产自动化经验
    国营鞍山钢铁公司小型轧钢厂群众性的“机械化自动化”运动所得到的成就，已引起全公司各厂矿职工和其他地区一些厂矿职工很大的兴趣。该公司所属各工厂、矿山的职工们，都有组织地到小型轧钢厂进行了学习性的参观。许多人在参观中看见小型轧钢厂机械化和自动化生产的景象，都称赞说：
    “小型轧钢厂的活多好做啊，摆弄电纽就能生产了！”他们对于和自己工作有关的改进部分，都作了细心的研究。中型轧钢厂工人张来福，拉着小型轧钢厂的自动翻钢机的创造者，问这问那，一直谈了一个多钟头。原来他正在研究一个翻钢机，他明白了小型轧钢厂翻钢机的原理之后，高兴地说：“我回去参考你们的翻钢机的构造原理来研究，一定能够成功。”很多技术人员都把小型轧钢厂的各种创造用铅笔画下草图，准备在改进本厂设备的时候做参考。工会、青年团的干部们把小型轧钢厂各种创造的意义和经济价值从图解上抄录下来，作为在自己的工厂、矿山中推广小型轧钢厂经验的宣传鼓动材料。各工厂、矿山的负责干部参观之后，对于发动全体职工，特别是发动老工人和技术人员，把生产过程逐步改造成机械化、自动化这一方向更加明确了。选矿厂中共党委会书记说：“我们厂的劳动条件也不好，回去之后一定要发动群众开动脑筋，走小型轧钢厂的道路。”
    唐山、太原和沈阳等地的轧钢厂和机械厂，已先后派人到小型轧钢厂来学习，或写信来索取“反围盘”的图样。东北机械管理局所属机械八厂和二十二厂，都是由厂长或其他负责人亲自领导“反围盘”的试验，现在都已试用成功。机械八厂利用“反围盘”轧制的钢材（六点五粍）比鞍钢小型轧钢厂生产的钢材还细（钢材愈细利用反围盘愈困难），这就更证实了张明山创造的“反围盘”的科学性。机械八厂压延车间，由于装置了“反围盘”，产量、质量都已显著提高；并促使了全车间设备的改进，因而使劳动条件得到根本的改善。过去作压延工被钢条烧坏右腿的描图员王俊宝说：“如果早有‘反围盘’，我这条腿就不会被拉掉了。”    　（新华社）
