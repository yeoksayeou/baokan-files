    The Tenant Farming Work in 1952 and Future Tasks
    Central People's Government Ministry of Interior Civil Affairs Department
    The rural tenant farming work in 1952, due to the enthusiastic response of the people nationwide to Chairman Mao's call to "increase production, practice thrift, to support the Chinese People's Volunteers," was further developed and achieved new successes.
    The first characteristic of the tenant farming work in 1952 was the significant strengthening of planning, overcoming the perfunctory phenomenon of "tenant farming for the sake of tenant farming," and greatly reducing instances of violating tenant farming policies. According to statistics from Wuxiang County, Shanxi Province, among the 3,393 households of revolutionary martyrs' families enjoying tenant farming, 80 percent had embarked on planned production. Not only were there annual and seasonal production plans, but also temporary arrangements could be made based on the overall plan and production activities, thereby overcoming the difficulties of unplanned, blind production and the lack of labor for revolutionary martyrs' families. Tenant farmers consciously included the plan in their patriotic covenants and regularly conducted inspections. More than 70 percent of villages in Wuxiang County established a "Preferential Treatment Day" system, conducting inspections and summaries every month on the preferential treatment day.
    Many areas implemented and promoted the method of revolutionary martyrs' families and tenant farmers signing tenant farming contracts. The content of the contracts generally included the amount of land to be tenant farmed, what to plant, who is responsible for tenant farming, how much fertilizer to apply, how to cultivate, and compensation terms. This enabled tenant farming work to be carried out in a more planned manner, effectively guaranteeing the yield of the land. According to a survey in Zhaodong County, Heilongjiang Province, 132 out of 239 villages signed contracts. Revolutionary martyrs' families generally reflected that "the contract farming contract is the magic weapon for tenant farmed land." Therefore, the effect of tenant farming was more significant than in previous years.
    The second characteristic of the tenant farming work in 1952 was the reduction of "labor allocation" and the development and improvement of fixed tenant farming, moving towards integration with mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives.
    There are many forms of fixed tenant farming. The first form is fixed to the household. That is, the land to be tenant farmed is allocated to each peasant household, which is responsible for cultivating it; the problem of balancing the labor burden between the peasants who should provide tenant farming services is solved by labor points or other methods. This was a more common form used in various places in 1952, which was much more progressive than "temporary labor allocation," but because it was only fixed to the household and based on individual labor, it seemed backward in the context of the development of cooperation and mutual assistance in rural areas. It is difficult to solve the problem of planned production and increasing yields, so it must be further developed.
    The second form is integration with agricultural production mutual aid teams. This is a form of tenant farming more commonly used in areas with a foundation for organization. That is, the agricultural production mutual aid team is responsible for tenant farming the land of revolutionary martyrs' families, while also absorbing revolutionary martyrs' families to participate in mutual aid teams for mutual assistance and labor exchange. The benefits of this are: first, the mutual aid team has strong labor power, can adjust labor power, and solve various difficulties, especially during busy farming seasons or in the case of rushing to plant or harvest, it has a more reliable guarantee than simply fixing to the household. Second, the mutual aid team can include the tenant farmed land in the team's production plan and carry out production in a planned manner. The team is superior to individual tenant farmers in terms of business technology and land processing. Third, it can absorb the full and semi-labor power of revolutionary martyrs' families to participate in the mutual aid team, which can overcome the meritorious service mentality and dependence mentality of some revolutionary martyrs' families and reduce the tenant farming burden on the masses. Fourth, the mutual aid team can easily carry out education on preferential treatment policies and easily exert the tenant farming enthusiasm of the masses.
    The third form is integration with agricultural production cooperatives. This is the advanced form of tenant farming organization at present. Its benefits are: first, the road taken by agricultural production cooperatives is the road of agricultural collectivization, which conforms to the direction of agricultural production development and has broad prospects. It can enhance the collective concept of revolutionary martyrs' families and the masses, and can organically link up with the country's production requirements. Second, the operating mode of agricultural production cooperatives is cooperative in nature. Under unified leadership and overall planning, the collective cultivation is unified and reasonably implemented according to the quantity and quality of the land in the whole cooperative, the types of crops, and the conditions of the people and livestock in the whole cooperative, so it can exert the potential of the land, which is far beyond the reach of other tenant farming forms. Third, agricultural production cooperatives uniformly fertilize the land in the cooperative according to actual needs, which can guarantee the yield of the land of revolutionary martyrs' families. Fourth, agricultural production cooperatives have certain public property (such as walking plows, chaff cutters, sprayers, etc.), reasonable labor, work point recording, profit distribution, rewards, public accumulation funds, and member welfare facilities, which can give play to the production enthusiasm of revolutionary martyrs' families and enable them to work as much as they can with a share of labor. Therefore, the form of integrating agricultural production cooperatives with tenant farming is a new direction, and its experience should be valued and summarized, and promoted.
    The third characteristic of the tenant farming work in 1952 was the mobilization and organization of revolutionary martyrs' families to actively participate in the patriotic bumper harvest movement, and great achievements were made. According to statistics from 29 counties in Hebei Province, revolutionary martyrs' families, revolutionary disabled soldiers, and demobilized soldiers participating in mutual aid teams accounted for about 50 percent, and Daming and Shexian reached about 80 percent. In Wuxiang County, Shanxi Province, 80 percent of revolutionary martyrs' families participated in different types of mutual aid teams, and 508 people became backbones and models in the production movement. Through organization, the labor force, especially women, among revolutionary martyrs' families, revolutionary disabled soldiers, and demobilized soldiers, invested in field production, overcoming the erroneous idea of simply relying on tenant farming relief, and increased production. Because revolutionary martyrs' families actively participated in production and their political awareness increased, there were many instances of refusing tenant farming preferential treatment. This not only reduced the tenant farming burden on the masses, but also produced many revolutionary martyrs' family labor models in the patriotic bumper harvest movement, which played a positive role in strengthening the masses' concept of supporting the families of revolutionary martyrs.
    The fourth characteristic of the tenant farming work in 1952 was the strengthening of inspection. Leading organs in various places generally conducted key inspections of tenant farming work. The inspection methods were very effective because they could be combined with the masses' production movement, with the masses' "evaluation and comparison" competition, and with solving the practical difficulties of revolutionary martyrs' families. For example, the method of Wuxiang County, Shanxi Province, for inspecting tenant farming work was to mobilize the masses to evaluate and inspect: "Look in the fields, ask at home, look at the manure piles, look at the cultivation." The method of inspection in Suiyuan Province in the spring was to organize tenant farmers to check and compare each other, the contents of which were: "Compare timely cultivation, compare the amount of fertilizer applied, compare meticulous cultivation, compare the quality of crops." Around the Dragon Boat Festival, Liaocheng Prefecture in Shandong Province launched an inspection of preferential treatment work throughout the prefecture, the contents of which were: "Check production, check tenant farming, check political status, check children's enrollment, check the resolution of special problems." This inspection method combining leadership and the masses is a good creation and should be promoted.
    Due to the development of mass "evaluation and comparison" inspections, various model deeds were recognized and emulated by the masses, and provided good preparation for the work of selecting preferential treatment models carried out in various places in the autumn and winter of 1952.
    The fifth characteristic of the tenant farming work in 1952 was the solution of the fertilizer problem for the land of revolutionary martyrs' families. This was a significant achievement of tenant farming work in various places in 1952. In solving the fertilizer problem, in addition to mobilizing revolutionary martyrs' families to accumulate fertilizer themselves, the following effective methods were adopted for those who had difficulty accumulating fertilizer and lacked fertilizer: first, help revolutionary martyrs' families dig pits and build pens, establish public toilets, and compost manure for a long time; second, mobilize the masses to donate fertilizer; third, banks and supply and marketing cooperatives lend fertilizer or pre-purchase fertilizer, giving priority to care; fourth, mobilize sheep farmers to let their sheep lie on the land of revolutionary martyrs' families. The implementation of these methods brought the amount of fertilizer applied to the land of revolutionary martyrs' families close to or reached the fertilizer application standards of local peasants, guaranteeing the yield of the land.
    Due to the close integration of the tenant farming work in 1952 with the agricultural patriotic increase production movement, the yield of tenant farmed land generally increased. According to a survey of the yield of 1,714 mu of tenant farmed land of 393 households of revolutionary martyrs' families in 41 villages in Xingtang and Fangshan counties, Hebei Province: 304 mu had higher yields than the masses, accounting for 17.8 percent; 1,315 mu had yields equivalent to the masses, accounting for 76.7 percent; 95 mu had lower yields than the masses, accounting for 5.5 percent. The majority of revolutionary martyrs' families' land in Hebei Province achieved yields no lower than the yields of ordinary peasants' land. In Wuxiang County, Shanxi Province, all 31,814 mu of tenant farmed land in the county achieved an all-round bumper harvest last year. In Zhejiang Province, the land tenant farmed in 1952 increased production by 10 to 30 percent compared with 1951. Revolutionary martyrs' families obtained more grain than in previous years and improved their lives. This greatly increased the strength for consolidating the morale of the troops, supporting the Chinese People's Volunteers, and strengthening the work of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, and also played a positive role in the country's large-scale economic construction.
    How to promote the experience of tenant farming work in 1952 and do a good job in tenant farming work in 1953?
    1. Leading organs at all levels must strengthen the education of the masses and cadres on resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea and patriotism, and should clearly recognize that doing a good job in preferential treatment work is an extremely important part of the work of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea. Tenant farming work should be regarded as an integral part of the agricultural bumper harvest movement in 1953, and should be specifically organized and led, and regularly inspected, so as to run through the whole year's production activities. It is necessary to conscientiously solve the fertilizer problem for the land of revolutionary martyrs' families, to closely combine tenant farming work with the patriotic bumper harvest movement, and to ensure the increased production of the land of revolutionary martyrs' families.
    2. Continue to deepen the education on tenant farming policies, encourage the tenant farming enthusiasm of the masses, and regard tenant farming as a glorious obligation that should be fulfilled. New areas should eliminate "blank spots" and correct the "random dispatch of troops" in the tenant farming method and the phenomenon of increasing the living difficulties of revolutionary martyrs' families due to "requiring meals" for tenant farming. It is necessary to mobilize the masses to conduct evaluation and review, and reasonably adjust the tenant farming burden surface and service surface in accordance with the preferential treatment regulations and the tenant farming methods of various provinces, and determine who should bear the tenant farming and who should enjoy the tenant farming, and prevent unreasonable phenomena such as "should be tenant farmed but not tenant farmed" and "all revolutionary martyrs' families are tenant farmed." At the same time, the phenomenon of excessively light and heavy tenant farming burdens should be appropriately resolved. In areas where there are too many revolutionary martyrs' families and the burden on the masses is particularly heavy, efforts should be made to take care of them.
    3. Continue to implement the policy of "organizing revolutionary martyrs' families to participate in production and establish family affairs," conscientiously strengthen the education of revolutionary martyrs' families, encourage them to "carry forward the revolutionary tradition and strive for greater glory," improve their political awareness, and organize them to engage in agricultural and sideline production.
    4. Strengthen the leadership of mutual aid teams, agricultural production cooperatives and tenant farmers engaged in tenant farming. Help them develop new production plans. Regularly check the implementation of their plans and solve existing problems. Special attention should be paid to summarizing the experience of agricultural production cooperatives combining tenant farming. In 1953, the work of exchanging experiences should be done more actively and timely in order to better promote the work.
    5. Cultivate models and consolidate models. The work of selecting preferential treatment models in 1952 has been carried out throughout the country, and a large number of model figures have emerged. In 1953, their regular education and assistance should be strengthened so that they can continue to play their active backbone role in the face of new tasks.

    一九五二年的代耕工作和今后的任务
    中央人民政府内务部优抚司
    一九五二年的农村代耕工作，由于全国人民热烈地响应了毛主席的“增加生产，厉行节约，以支持中国人民志愿军”的号召，得到了进一步的开展，取得了新的成就。
    一九五二年代耕工作的第一个特点，是大大加强了计划性，克服了为“代耕而代耕”的应付现象，违反代耕政策的事例大大减少。根据山西省武乡县的统计，享受代耕的三千三百九十三户的烈军属中，有百分之八十走上了计划生产。不仅有全年与季节的生产计划，而且能根据整个计划及生产活动作临时的安排，从而克服了无计划的盲目生产与烈军属无劳力经营的困难。代耕人自觉地把计划订在自己的爱国公约里，经常进行检查。武乡全县有百分之七十以上的村建立了“优抚日”制度，每月逢优抚日就进行检查总结。
    许多地区实行并推广了烈军属与代耕户双方订立代耕合同的办法。合同的内容大致为代耕多少土地，种什么，谁负责代耕，上多少粪，怎样耕种，以及包赔等项条件。这样就使代耕工作能更有计划地进行，有效地保证了土地的产量。据黑龙江省肇东县的调查，在二百三十九个村中，有一百三十二个村订立了合同。烈军属普遍反映说：“包耕合同是代耕地的法宝。”因之代耕的效果比往年显著。
    一九五二年代耕工作的第二个特点是“拨工”的形式减少，固定代耕的形式在发展与提高，并且朝着结合互助组和农业生产合作社的方向发展。
    固定代耕的形式很多。第一种形式是固定到户。即将应代耕的土地，分配给各户农民，由其负责耕种；应出代耕勤务的农民之间的劳力负担的平衡问题，另用工票或其他方法解决。这是一九五二年各地较普遍使用的形式，它较之“临时拨工”要进步得多，但因只是固定到户，是以个体劳动为基础，在农村发展合作互助的情况下，就显得落后了；它难于解决有计划生产和提高产量的问题，故必须进一步发展。
    第二种形式是结合到生产互助组。这是组织起来有基础的地区较为普遍采用的一种代耕形式。即由农业生产互助组负责代耕烈军属的土地，同时也吸收烈军属参加互助组来互助变工。它的好处是：第一、互助组劳动力强，能够调剂劳动力，解决各项困难，特别在农忙季节或抢种、抢收的情况下，较单纯固定于户有更可靠的保障。第二、互助组可以将代耕的土地订入组内的生产计划，有计划地进行生产，在经营技术、土地加工上均较单干户代耕为优越。第三、能吸收烈军属的整、半劳动力参加互助组，这样可以克服某些烈军属的功臣思想和依赖思想，减轻群众的代耕负担。第四、互助组容易进行优抚政策的教育，容易发挥群众的代耕热情。
    第三种形式是结合农业生产合作社。这是目前代耕组织的高级形式。它的好处是：第一、农业生产合作社所走的道路，是农业集体化的道路，符合于农业生产的发展方向，有广阔的前途。它可以增进烈军属与群众的集体观念，并能和国家的生产要求有机地联系起来。第二、农业生产合作社的经营方式，是合作性质的，在统一领导和全面计划下，根据全社土地的数量、质量及作物种类、全社人、畜力的情况等条件，统一地、合理地实行集体耕作，所以能发挥土地的潜在力，远非其他代耕形式所能及。第三、农业生产合作社对社内土地一律按实际需要统一施肥，能够保证烈军属土地的产量。第四、农业生产合作社有一定的公共财产（如步犁、铡草机、喷雾器等），有合理的劳动、记工、分红、奖励、公积金等制度和社员福利等设施，能发挥烈军属的生产积极性，使他们有一分劳力就能劳动一分。因此，结合农业生产合作社代耕的形式，是一个新的方向，应该重视与总结它的经验，并加以推广。
    一九五二年代耕工作的第三个特点，是发动与组织烈军属积极参加爱国丰产运动，并取得了很大成绩。据河北省二十九个县的统计，烈军属、革命残废军人、复员军人参加互助组的占百分之五十左右，大名、涉县达到百分之八十左右。山西省武乡县百分之八十的烈军属参加了不同类型的互助组，有五百零八人成为生产运动中的骨干与模范。通过组织起来，烈军属、革命残废军人、复员军人中的劳动力特别是妇女投入了田间生产，克服了单纯依靠代耕救济的错误思想，并增加了产量。由于烈军属积极参加生产和政治觉悟提高，谢绝代耕优待的事例也很多。这样不但减轻了群众的代耕负担，而且在爱国丰产运动中，涌现了很多烈军属劳动模范，对于加强群众优属观念起了积极作用。
    一九五二年代耕工作的第四个特点，是加强了检查。各地领导机关对代耕工作一般都进行了重点的检查。检查的方法，因为能够与群众的生产运动相结合，与群众的“评比”竞赛相结合，与解决烈军属的实际困难相结合，故收效很大。如山西省武乡县检查代耕工作的方法，是发动群众评比检查：“地里看，家里问，看粪堆，看耕作”。绥远省春季检查的方法，是组织代耕户互相查比，内容是：“比耕作及时，比施肥多少，比精耕细作，比庄稼好坏”。山东省聊城专区在端阳节前后，发动全专区对优抚工作进行检查，其内容为：“查生产，查代耕，查政治地位，查子女入学，查特殊问题的解决情况”。这种领导与群众相结合的检查方法，是很好的创造，应该加以推广。
    由于群众性的“评比”检查的开展，各种模范事迹为群众所公认，所效法，并给一九五二年秋冬各地所进行的评选优抚模范的工作作了良好的准备。
    一九五二年代耕工作的第五个特点，是解决了烈军属土地的肥料问题。这是一九五二年各地代耕工作的显著成果。在解决肥料问题上，除发动烈军属自行积肥外，对积肥有困难和缺乏肥料者，采取了以下的几种有效办法：第一、帮助烈军属挖坑修圈，建立公共厕所，及长期沤粪；第二、发动群众献肥；第三、银行、供销社贷肥料或预购肥料，优先加以照顾；第四、发动养羊户为烈军属卧地。这些办法的实施，使烈军属土地的施肥量接近或达到了当地农民的施肥标准，保证了土地产量。
    一九五二年的代耕工作，由于密切地结合了农业爱国增产运动，代耕土地普遍增加了产量。河北省根据行唐、房山两县四十一个村三百九十三户烈军属
    一千七百一十四亩代耕土地产量的调查：高于群众产量的有三百零四亩，占百分之十七点八；相当于群众产量的有一千三百一十五亩，占百分之七十六点七；低于群众产量者九十五亩，占百分之五点五。河北全省做到了多数的烈军属土地产量不低于一般群众土地的产量。山西省武乡县全县三万一千八百一十四亩代耕土地，去年获得了全面丰收。浙江省一九五二年代耕的土地，比一九五一年增产一成至三成，烈军属较往年获得了更多的粮食，改善了生活。这对于巩固部队情绪，支持中国人民志愿军，加强抗美援朝的工作增加了很大的力量，对于国家大规模经济建设事业也有积极的作用。
    如何把一九五二年代耕工作的经验加以推广，并做好一九五三年的代耕工作呢？
    一、各级领导机关要加强对群众和干部的抗美援朝和爱国主义教育，应该明确认识到做好优抚工作是抗美援朝工作的一个极重要的内容。要把代耕工作作为一九五三年农业丰产运动的一个组成部分，加以具体的组织和领导，并经常进行检查，以便贯穿于全年的生产活动中。要认真解决烈军属土地的肥料问题，要使代耕工作与爱国丰产运动紧密地结合起来，确保烈军属的土地增产。
    二、继续深入进行代耕政策的教育，鼓舞群众的代耕热情，把代耕视为应尽的光荣义务。新区要消灭“空白点”和纠正在代耕方式上的“乱点兵”以及因代耕“要管饭”而加重烈军属生活困难的现象。要发动群众进行评比审查，依照优抚条例和各省代耕办法的规定，合理地调整代耕负担面与服勤面，并确定那些人应负担代耕，那些人应享受代耕，防止“应代而未代”及凡“烈军属就代耕”等不合理现象。同时，应适当地解决代耕负担的畸轻畸重的现象，在烈军属过多、群众负担特重的地区，应设法予以照顾。
    三、继续贯彻“组织烈军属参加生产、建立家务”的方针，认真加强对烈军属的教育，鼓励他们“发扬革命传统，争取更大光荣”，提高他们的政治觉悟，并组织他们进行农、副业生产。
    四、加强对代耕的互助组、农业生产合作社及代耕户的领导。帮助他们订立新的生产计划。随时检查他们计划的执行情况，解决存在的问题。特别要注意总结农业生产合作社结合代耕的经验。一九五三年应把交流经验的工作做得更活跃、更及时，以更好地推动工作。
    五、培养模范，巩固模范。一九五二年的评选优抚模范的工作在全国得到了开展，出现了大批模范人物。在一九五三年应加强对他们的经常教育和帮助，使他们在新的任务面前继续发扬其积极骨干作用。
