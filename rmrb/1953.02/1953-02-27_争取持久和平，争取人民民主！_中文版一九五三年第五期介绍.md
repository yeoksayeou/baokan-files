    "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!" Chinese edition, 1953, issue 5 is now published.

    This issue contains the communique from the Central Statistical Bureau of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union regarding the results of the implementation of the 1952 Soviet national economic development plan, as well as news about the results of the implementation of the 1952 national economic plans of Poland, Hungary, and Romania. This issue publishes an editorial entitled "A Powerful New Upsurge in the Peaceful Economy of the Socialist Camp," which states: The achievements of the Soviet Union in communist construction and the continuous upsurge of the Soviet economy have had a decisive impact on the entire course of world history. Several Stalin Five-Year Plans have transformed the Soviet Union. Today, the output of large-scale Soviet industry in nine days is equal to the total output of all Russian industry in a year before the Great October Socialist Revolution. The Soviet Union now produces more electricity in one month than Russia produced in five years before the revolution. The editorial describes the achievements of the Soviet national economy in 1952 (the second year of the Fifth Five-Year Plan) and the further improvement of the Soviet people's living standards. The editorial then says: Countries that have begun to build a new life according to the Soviet example also achieved remarkable success in national economy and culture last year. The great Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and their long-tested leader Comrade Mao Zedong, have largely completed the restoration phase. New China has entered the stage of national reconstruction and has begun its first five-year plan for developing the national economy. European People's Democratic countries also achieved brilliant successes in 1952. The editorial emphasizes: It is not difficult to understand that these achievements will inevitably arouse the barbaric and vicious hatred of the rulers of the imperialist camp, who will not hesitate to adopt the most insidious, despicable, and cruel methods to oppose the countries of the socialist camp. Under these circumstances, comprehensively enhancing political vigilance, opposing all manifestations of carelessness, complacency, and paralysis, and exposing all the conspiracies of the enemies of peace—the imperialist war-mongers and their accomplices, the right-wing socialists and Tito elements—are of particular importance.

    This issue publishes in full the joint appeal issued on January 27 by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Germany, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of France, and the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany to the people of Germany and France against the ratification of the Bonn Treaty and the Paris Military Treaty.

    Important articles published in this issue include: "Laying the Socialist Material-Technical Foundation in Slovakia" by Julius Branyik, member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, and "The Great Struggle of the Italian People to Defend Democracy" by Pietro Secchia, Deputy General Secretary of the Italian Communist Party.

    This issue also publishes an article by V. Kirsanov, discussing unemployment and hunger in Tito's Yugoslavia, pointing out that the working people of Yugoslavia are increasingly strengthening their struggle against Tito's fascist tyranny and colonial enslavement.

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版一九五三年第五期介绍
    共产党和工人党情报局机关报“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版一九五三年第五期已经出版。
    本期刊载了苏联部长会议中央统计局关于一九五二年苏联发展国民经济国家计划执行结果的公报，以及波兰、匈牙利、罗马尼亚一九五二年国民经济计划执行结果的消息。本期发表题为“社会主义阵营各国和平经济的强大新高涨”的社论说：苏联在共产主义建设上的成就和苏联经济的不断高涨，对于整个世界历史的进程发生了决定性的影响。几个斯大林五年计划已使苏联焕然改观。今天，苏联大规模的工业每九天的产量就等于伟大的十月社会主义革命前夕俄国全部工业一年的总产量。苏联现在一个月生产的电力就等于革命以前的俄国五年所生产的电力。社论叙述了苏联一九五二年（第五个五年计划的第二年）国民经济的成就和苏联人民生活水平进一步提高的情况。社论接着说：按照苏联的榜样开始建设新生活的国家，去年在国民经济和文化方面也获得了显著的成就。伟大的中国人民，在中国共产党和他们久经考验的领袖毛泽东同志的领导下，已大体上完成了恢复阶段。新中国已经进入全国重新建设的阶段，已经开始了发展国民经济的第一个五年计划。欧洲人民民主国家也在一九五二年获得了辉煌的成就。社论强调指出：不难了解，这些成就必然会引起帝国主义阵营统治者的野蛮恶毒的仇恨，这些统治者毫不犹豫地采取最阴险、卑鄙和残酷的方法，来反对社会主义阵营的国家。在这种情形之下，全面地提高政治警惕，反对一切粗枝大叶、沾沾自喜和麻痹大意的表现，揭露和平的敌人——帝国主义战争贩子及其帮凶右翼社会党人和铁托分子——的一切阴谋，就有了特别重要的意义。
    本期全文刊载了德国共产党中央委员会、法国共产党中央委员会和德国统一社会党中央委员会一月二十七日发出的向德、法两国人民呼吁反对批准波恩条约和巴黎军事条约的联合号召。
    本期刊载的重要文章有：捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员尤利乌斯·布拉尼克的“在斯洛伐克奠定社会主义物质—技术基础”，意大利共产党副总书记彼特罗·谢嘉的“意大利人民保卫民主的伟大斗争”。
    本期还发表了弗·基尔萨诺夫的一篇文章，论述铁托南斯拉夫的失业和饥饿现象，指出南斯拉夫劳动人民正在日益加强他们反对铁托法西斯暴政和殖民地奴役的斗争。
