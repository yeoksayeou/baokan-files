The CCP Committees and People's Governments at all levels in the East China provinces and municipalities universally and deeply inspected the work of handling people's letters in November and December of last year, strengthening the importance attached to the work of people's letters by leaders at all levels.

After the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" campaigns last year, the political consciousness of the people was raised, and the People's Governments and CCP Committees of various provinces and municipalities received many letters from the people. Some of these letters put forward opinions on industrial and agricultural production and the improvement of social facilities, and some reported incidents of cadres violating laws and discipline, which shows the people's love and trust for the People's Government and the Chinese Communist Party. According to the results of inspections in various places, more than 80 percent of the information provided by people's letters from January to November of last year was true. For example, of the 21 letters from the people received by the CCP Putian County Committee in Fujian Province, 18 were in line with the actual situation. Of the people's letters received by the Shanghai Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau, only 3 percent did not conform to the facts. These letters not only reflected various situations, but also provided suggestions for improving the work and urged various departments to improve their work. After the Quanzhou Hospital in Fujian Province was criticized in a people's letter for not actively treating patients with acute illnesses, the leading department rectified the work of the hospital. The Fujian Provincial Federation of Trade Unions studied the people's letters in a timely manner and uncovered counter-revolutionaries lurking in the grassroots trade unions in Gutian County.

During the inspection of handling people's letters, the leading organs at all levels in East China provinces and municipalities discovered that some district and township cadres still had acts of corruption and bribery, loss of position, and coercion and commandism. In inspecting 75 people's letters, the leading organs of Yangxin County, Shandong Province, found that 31 district and township cadres were exposed and criticized, most of whom were guilty of corruption and bribery, shielding counter-revolutionaries, and oppressing the masses. People's letters from Fuyang Prefecture in Anhui Province and Jinhua Prefecture in Zhejiang Province also criticized some district and township cadres for being out of touch with the masses and "reporting good news but not bad news." To this end, the leading organs at all levels conscientiously and responsibly organized inspection teams to conduct inspections and handle cases at each level. The CCP Fujian Provincial Committee and local organizations at all levels formed 32 inspection teams to focus on inspecting 12 counties and 17 districts, and specially conducted investigations and research on major events. The CCP Huimin Prefectural Committee of Shandong Province, when focusing on the rectification of party members at the district level, used typical examples in handling people's letters as educational materials for criticizing bureaucracy and commandism. The leading organs of Yangxin County, in conjunction with the rural party rectification work, organized inspection teams to go deep into the villages to conduct inspections, and ensured that every letter from the people was accounted for and every matter was settled.

After this inspection, the leading organs at all levels in the East China provinces and municipalities equipped full-time or part-time cadres for handling people's letters, initially established systems for receiving, sending, registering, expediting, forwarding, reporting, summarizing, and inspecting, and established people's reception work. The CCP Fujian Provincial Committee decided that the provincial, prefectural, and county-level organs should establish committees for handling people's letters under the unified leadership of the Party Committee, correcting the past procrastination and backlog of handling people's letters in organizations at all levels. Responsible cadres of the CCP committees and People's Governments in many places personally approved or reviewed people's letters, and leaders of many counties and districts regularly reported the handling of people's letters to higher authorities.

    华东各省、市中共党委和各级人民政府
    加强对处理人民来信工作的检查和领导
    华东各省、市中共各级党委和各级人民政府在去年十一、十二两月，普遍深入地检查了处理人民来信的工作，加强了各级领导对人民来信工作的重视。
    去年“三反”、“五反”后，人民群众的政治觉悟提高了，各省、市人民政府和中共党委收到了很多的人民来信。这些信件有的提出了对工、农业生产和改进社会设施等方面的意见，有的检举了干部违法乱纪事件，这说明广大人民对人民政府和中国共产党的爱护和信任。根据各地检查结果，从去年一月到十一月，人民来信提供的情况百分之八十以上是确实的。譬如中共福建省莆田县委员会收到的二十一件人民来信，十八件都符合实际情况。上海市人民政府公安局收到的人民来信中，只有百分之三不符事实。这些来信不仅反映了各种情况，并且对工作中存在的问题提供了改进办法，督促各部门改进了工作。福建省泉州医院因对病人的急症不积极救治，人民来信提出批评后，领导部门就整顿了该院的工作。福建省总工会及时研究了人民的来信，破获了潜伏在古田县基层工会中的反革命分子。
    华东各省、市各级领导机关在检查处理人民来信工作中，发现在某些区乡干部中还存在着贪污舞弊，丧失立场和强迫命令等行为。山东省阳信县领导机关在检查七十五件人民来信中，发现被揭发和批评的区乡干部有三十一人，其中大多数犯有贪污舞弊、包庇反革命和欺压群众等行为。安徽省的阜阳专区和浙江省的金华专区等地的人民来信也批评了某些区乡干部脱离群众和“报喜不报忧”等错误。为此，各级领导机关都认真负责地组织了检查组，逐级进行检查和处理。中共福建省委员会及各级地方组织，组成了三十二个检查组，重点检查了十二个县和十七个区，对重大事件并专门进行了调查研究工作。中共山东省惠民地委会在集中区一级干部整党时，将处理人民来信中的典型事例作为批判官僚主义和强迫命令作风的教育材料。阳信县领导机关结合农村整党工作，组织检查组深入到村进行检查，对人民来信作到件件有交代，事事有着落。
    经过这次检查后，华东各省、市的各级领导机关对处理人民来信都配备了专职或兼职干部，初步建立了收发、登记、催办、转办、汇报、总结、检查等制度，并设立了人民接待工作。中共福建省委员会决定省、专区、县一级机关在党委统一领导下成立处理人民来信委员会，纠正了过去在各级组织中对处理人民来信的拖拉和积压现象。许多地方的中共党委会和人民政府的负责干部都亲自批办或审阅人民来信，有不少县和区的领导干部已定期向上级作处理人民来信的报告。
