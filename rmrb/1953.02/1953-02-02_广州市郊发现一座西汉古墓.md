    A Western Han Tomb Discovered in the Suburbs of Guangzhou
    A Western Han tomb was recently discovered in Shitougang, Xicun, in the suburbs of Guangzhou, and some valuable antiquities were obtained from the tomb. This tomb is six meters deep from the surface. The tomb structure is made of huge wooden pillars, estimated to weigh about 500 to 1,000 jin each. Around the coffin were placed 18 pieces of various bronzes, pottery, and lacquerware (not counting the scattered pieces). There were also four long and short swords and two halberds in the tomb. Although there was water in the tomb, the blades of the swords were still very sharp. There was also a bronze mirror, which, judging from the patterns engraved on the mirror, is a Chu mirror from the Warring States period (about 2,300 years ago). There were also some jade ornaments. According to preliminary research by the Guangzhou People's Museum and the Guangzhou Municipal Cultural Relics Preservation Committee, it is believed that this is an ancient tomb from the early Western Han Dynasty, about 2,100 years ago, and it is estimated that it may be the tomb of a military officer under Zhao Tuo, the King of Nanyue. The Guangzhou People's Museum and the Guangzhou Municipal Cultural Relics Preservation Committee are currently conducting in-depth research on these antiquities.

    广州市郊发现一座西汉古墓
    广州市郊西村石头岗最近发现了一座西汉古墓，并在墓中获得一部分有价值的古物。这座古墓，离地面六公尺深，墓廓以一根根的巨大木柱构成，估计每根木柱约重五六百斤至一千斤。棺的四周，放着各种铜器、陶器、漆器共十八件（零碎的不计）。墓里还有长短剑四把，戈二枝，墓里虽然有水，但剑锋还很锋利。另外有一面铜镜，从镜上所刻花纹鉴别，是战国时代的楚镜（距今约二千三百年左右）。另有一些玉质装饰品。据广州市人民博物馆和广州市文物保管委员会初步考据，认为这是西汉初期的古墓，距今约有二千一百年，估计可能是南越王赵佗属下武官的墓地。现广州市人民博物馆和广州市文物保管委员会正对这些古物深入研究中。
