    Political Education in Winter Training of Construction Workers in Northeast China Achieves Great Results
    Various Training Classes Are Now Preparing to Transition to the Technical Education Stage
    Through political study in the winter training, 160,000 construction workers in Northeast China have generally received relatively profound class education and patriotic education. Over the past two months, the class consciousness of the trainees has been greatly enhanced. They generally recognize the prospects of national industrialization and the great future of construction workers, clarifying the relationship between national construction and individuals. In the past, many construction workers were worried that once the buildings were completed, they would lose their jobs; some even felt that construction workers suffered too much from wind and rain, and therefore preferred to go to factories and mines for production. After political study in the winter training, these erroneous ideas have been initially reversed. They realize that their work is "laying the foundation for the country's industrialization and move towards socialism," and their enthusiasm for learning has been greatly increased. At the winter training class of the No. 1 Engineering Department of the Northeast Industrial Department, when the school first opened, people asking for leave blocked the office door, but now very few people ask for leave, and workers voluntarily request to attend Party classes and Youth League classes. They said, "We must seize the time to study, otherwise we will fall further behind the needs of the motherland, and how can we realize national industrialization!" When the winter training class of Liaoxi Province discussed "How to build the motherland well," plumber Wang Degong reviewed, "In the past, I was unwilling to teach apprentices, fearing that teaching apprentices well would starve the master. This time I realized that to build the motherland well, we must train more apprentices." After the meeting, he immediately made a plan to teach ten apprentices well this year. After the winter training class of Changchun No. 3 Engineering Department finished the lesson "The Great Motherland," many vivid examples emerged. Bricklayer Pang Fuqi originally wanted to go home, but after listening to the lesson, he felt that he would be letting down Chairman Mao and the Communist Party if he did not study hard. Not only did he settle down, but he also wrote a letter to call back two bricklayers who had gone home.
    Due to the recognition of the prospects of national industrialization and the glorious position of construction workers, the sense of responsibility as masters has also been greatly strengthened. A worker from the Nonferrous Metals Administration's winter training class said, "In the past, I always thought that only workers in smelting plants were considered working class. What kind of working class are we who are in the construction site all day long! Once the houses are built, we leave. How can we be called the masters of the country? Now I understand that the country is our own, and only by building the country well can individuals have a better life."
    In addition, many workers wrote letters of determination requesting to join the Party. Many young workers in the Anshan winter training class said, "Let's work hard, and socialism and communism will come sooner!" In addition, many workers reviewed the mistakes they made in their work last year of not paying attention to quality and being irresponsible during the study; some workers who were previously rated with high wages voluntarily requested to lower them. These examples show that the winter training political study has basically achieved the expected results, which has cultivated a group of backbones for the basic construction team in 1953, and laid the foundation for the next stage of technical education.
    The reason why the political education in winter training in the whole region has achieved such results is first and foremost inseparable from the attention and leadership of the local Party committees. Before the winter training began, the Party committees of various provinces and cities and relevant units jointly established winter training committees to uniformly lead the winter training work. Many provinces and cities also set up training classes and transferred cadres to prepare backbone forces and teachers for the winter training. After the study began, most provincial and municipal Party committees also conducted timely inspections of the winter training work in conjunction with relevant units; some provinces and cities also held meetings to exchange teaching experience, which enabled some units that did not pay attention to winter training to quickly transform; many specific problems were also resolved. Many leading cadres of provincial and municipal Party committees, such as Feng Jixin, Deputy Secretary of the Heilongjiang Provincial Party Committee, personally lectured to the winter training staff, which played a great role in ensuring the effectiveness of winter training.
    Secondly, the clear purpose of winter training political study is an important factor in ensuring the effectiveness of the study. In view of the short study time, all units initially paid attention to determining the teaching content based on the ideological situation of construction workers, generally focusing on class education and vision education. Facts have proved that this approach is correct.
    In addition, all units have also spent a lot of effort to strengthen and improve organizational leadership and teaching methods. For example, in order to ensure the effectiveness of the study, the units adopted vivid and practical teaching methods, organized workers to watch movies and visit on-site in conjunction with lectures; some units have also developed advanced methods for teachers to prepare lessons and solve the problem of insufficient counselors, so that the winter training work can be carried out smoothly even in the face of difficulties in manpower and material resources. In addition, many units have also paid attention to providing appropriate care and solutions to the welfare problems of students.
    Currently, the political study of all units is nearing completion and they are preparing to transition to the technical education stage.

### 东北建筑工人冬训中政治教育收效很大  各训练班现正准备转入技术教育阶段

    东北建筑工人冬训中政治教育收效很大
    各训练班现正准备转入技术教育阶段
    东北十六万建筑工人，在冬季训练的政治学习中，普遍受到比较深刻的阶级教育和爱国主义教育。两个月来，受训工人阶级觉悟大为提高，一般都认识到了国家工业化的前途和基本建设工人的远大前程，弄清了国家建设和个人的关系。过去很多建筑工人都担心：大楼有一天盖完了，自己就要失业；甚至有的工人觉得建筑工人风吹雨淋太苦了，因此愿意到生产厂矿去。经过冬训政治学习后，都初步扭转了这些错误思想，认识到了自己的工作正是“为祖国工业化和走向社会主义打底子”，学习情绪都高涨起来。东北工业部第一工程处的冬训班，刚开学时，请假的人堵住了办公室的门，现在已很少有人请假，工人并主动地要求上党课和团课。他们说：“得抓紧时间学习，不然就更赶不上祖国的需要，那怎么能实现国家工业化呢！”辽西省冬训班在讨论“怎样才能建设好祖国”时，水暖工王德功检讨说：“我过去就不愿教徒弟，怕教好徒弟饿死师傅，这次知道了要建设好祖国，必须多带徒弟。”会后，他马上订出了计划，今年要教好十个徒弟。长春第三工程处冬训班讲完“伟大的祖国”一课，出现了不少生动的事例。瓦工庞富起本来想回家，可是听完课以后，觉得不好好学习对不起毛主席和共产党，不但自己安下心来，并且写信把回家的两个瓦工叫了回来。
    由于对国家工业化前途和建筑工人的光荣岗位有了认识，主人翁责任感也大大加强。有色金属管理局冬训班有个工人说：“过去我总以为像冶炼厂那里的工人才算工人阶级，咱们整天在工地里算什么工人阶级啊！房子盖好，咱们就走，怎么能说是国家主人翁呢？现在才明白了国家是咱们自己的，只有把国家建设好，个人的生活才能更好。”
    另外，有很多工人写了决心书要求入党。鞍山冬训班很多青年工人讲：“咱们好好干，社会主义、共产主义就来得快一点儿！”另外还有很多工人在学习中检讨了去年在工作中不重视质量、不负责任的错误；有的工人过去工薪评高了，这次主动地要求降低。这些事例说明，冬训政治学习已基本上收到了预期效果，这就为一九五三年基本建设队伍培养了一批骨干，并且为下一步技术教育打下了基础。
    全区冬训政治教育所以收到这样的效果，首先是和各地党委的重视与领导分不开的。在冬训学习开始之前，中共各省、市委和有关单位都联合成立了冬训委员会，统一领导冬训工作，很多省、市并开办了训练班、抽调了干部，给冬训准备了骨干力量和教员。学习开始之后，多数省、市党委又联合有关单位，对冬训工作及时进行了检查；有的省、市并召开了交流教学经验的会议，使某些不重视冬训工作的单位得以迅速转变；许多具体问题也获得解决。有不少省、市委领导干部，如黑龙江省委副书记冯纪新等，亲自给冬训职工讲课，这对保证冬训学习效果起了很大作用。
    其次，冬训政治学习目的明确，是保证学习效果的重要因素。鉴于学习时间短促，各单位一开始便都注意了根据建筑工人的思想情况确定教学内容，一般都集中在阶级教育和远景教育上。事实证明，这样做法是正确的。
    此外，在组织领导、教学方法方面，各单位也都花费了不少力量来加强和改进。例如：为了确保学习效果，各单位采取了形象的、联系实际的教学方法，配合讲课，组织工人看电影、实地参观等；有些单位并研究出一些教员备课、解决辅导员不足等问题的先进方法，使冬训工作在人力、物力都感困难的情况下，得以顺利进行。另外，对学员生活福利问题，很多单位也都注意给予适当照顾和加以解决。
    目前各单位的政治学习都已近结束，正准备转入技术教育阶段。
