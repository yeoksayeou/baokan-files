    Northeast and North China farmers are tensely preparing for large-scale production in order to actively participate in the country's large-scale economic construction and strive for a bumper agricultural harvest this year.

    Since last winter, Northeast and North China have generally combined rural Party rectification work with preparations for this year's large-scale production. Party and government leading organs in various regions have educated the broad masses of farmers on the direction of agricultural development, publicized the significance of the country's commencement of large-scale economic construction, and greatly enhanced the farmers' political awareness. Party and government leading organs at all levels in North China have paid attention to deploying the production tasks for the entire year on the basis of summarizing last year's patriotic bumper harvest movement, changing the past practice of separating winter production from the coming year's production, and making preparations for this year's large-scale production one step ahead. Shanxi Province clearly put forward the policy of "transforming winter into the first quarter of agricultural production," and farmers throughout the province have universally taken active action to launch a competition to do a good job in winter production. Various regions have also paid attention to consolidating and developing mutual aid teams and agricultural producers' cooperatives in winter. More than 3,000 year-round mutual aid teams in Yushu County, Jilin Province, have been further consolidated after rectification, of which more than 900 year-round mutual aid teams were formed by merging three to five small groups. In Jie County, Shanxi Province, and other places, many mutual aid teams have grown from small to large and from stagnant to active, and some have increased public property and are preparing to expand reproduction; quite a few agricultural producers' cooperatives were newly established in Changzhi Prefecture of the province in winter.

    Paying attention to agricultural capital construction and closely integrating agricultural and sideline production is a prominent feature of Northeast and North China's preparations for this year's large-scale production. Some areas in North China began to repair land, improve soil, and build farmland water conservancy projects as early as November last year. Five counties in Shanxi Province, including Pingshun, Yushe, Wenshui, Shouyang, and Zuoquan, have repaired more than 10,000 mu of terraced fields, improved more than 45,000 mu of soil, and built more than 200 water canals, in addition to significant achievements in building reservoirs and digging wells. After the autumn harvest, farmers in Baodi County, Hebei Province, began to repair canals, completing two canals with a total length of more than 17,000 meters, which can irrigate 200,000 mu of land. Northeast China has generally paid attention to agricultural capital construction. Longhua County, Rehe Province, has dug 113 new and repaired old wells, and newly dug and renovated 68 water canals. Dongfeng County, Liaodong Province, decided to dig 3,000 wells to irrigate 15,000 hectares (1 hectare = 15 mu) of cultivated land and decided to improve 2,000 hectares of low-lying land. After these two capital construction projects are completed, grain production can be increased by 6,712,000 jin. Farmers in Taonan County, Heilongjiang Province, have used the income from sideline production to purchase more than 500 head of draught animals and more than 70 carts.

    In order to comprehensively carry out technical reforms and universally increase yield per unit area, a mass movement to promote the experience of bumper harvests in Zhaoyuan County, Heilongjiang Province, has been launched in the Northeast countryside, from cadres to farmers. Counties in Heilongjiang Province and Songjiang, Liaodong, Jilin, and other provinces have successively organized large numbers of cadres and farmer representatives to go to Zhaoyuan to study on the spot, and in combination with the characteristics of local agricultural production, put forward cultivation methods suitable for their own regions. Yushu County, Jilin Province, mobilized 3,000 mutual aid teams to "find tricks" in order to concentrate and organize systematic cultivation methods, and then promote them. The Northeast provinces are training more than 3,300 agricultural technical cadres to establish 1,000 agricultural technical guidance stations; in addition, before the spring ploughing, millions of farmers in the entire region will acquire agricultural science and technology knowledge. North China provinces are also training a large number of agricultural technicians. Hebei Province alone plans to have 10 million people directly or indirectly trained in winter and spring.

    However, at present, the preparation work for this year's large-scale production in Northeast and North China is not developing evenly. Some areas neglect leading winter production and conduct Party rectification, winter training, and investigation in isolation. Some areas focus too much on simply engaging in sideline production and neglect agricultural capital construction. These must be promptly corrected in order to lay a good foundation for a bumper agricultural harvest this year. (Xinhua News Agency)

    东北和华北农民紧张准备进行大生产
    东北、华北农民为了积极参加国家大规模经济建设，争取今年农业丰收，目前正在紧张地进行大生产前的各项准备工作。
    东北、华北各地自去冬以来，普遍结合农村整党工作，开展了今年大生产的各项准备工作。各地党、政领导机关向广大农民进行农业发展方向的教育，宣传国家开始大规模经济建设的意义，大大提高了农民的政治觉悟。华北各级党、政领导机关注意在总结去年爱国丰产运动的基础上布置今年全年的生产任务，改变了过去把冬季生产与来年生产分割开来的作法，使今年大生产的准备工作提前一步。山西省明确提出“变冬季为农业生产的第一季度”的方针，全省农民普遍积极行动起来，展开了搞好冬季生产的竞赛。各地在冬季还注意整顿和发展互助组和农业生产合作社的工作。吉林省榆树县有三千多个常年互助组在整顿后更加巩固了，其中九百多个常年互助组是由三五个小型组合并而成的。山西省解县等地许多互助组由小变大，由停滞变活跃，有些并增积公有财产，准备扩大再生产；该省长治专区冬季新成立了不少农业生产合作社。
    重视农业基本建设，使农、副业生产紧密结合，是东北、华北为今年大生产作好准备的显著特点。华北有些地区早在去年十一月就开始修整土地、改良土壤、兴修农田水利等。山西省平顺、榆社、文水、寿阳、左权等五县已修整梯田一万多亩，改良土壤四万五千多亩，修水渠二百多条，此外修蓄水池、打井等也有很大成绩。河北省宝坻县农民秋收后即开始修渠，已完成共长一万七千多公尺的水渠两道，可浇地二十万亩。东北对农业基本建设一般都已注意，热河省隆化县已打新井和修旧井共一百十三眼，新挖和整修水渠六十八道。辽东省东丰县决定打井三千眼，以灌溉耕地一万五千垧（每垧十五亩），并决定改良低洼地二千垧。这两项基本建设工作做好后，可增产六百七十一万二千斤粮食。黑龙江省洮南县农民已用副业生产的收入，买进五百多头耕畜和七十多辆大车。
    为了全面进行技术改革，普遍提高单位面积产量，东北农村从干部到农民已展开了推广黑龙江省肇源县丰产经验的群众性运动。黑龙江省各县和松江、辽东、吉林等省都先后组织大批干部、农民代表前往肇源实地学习，并结合本地农业生产的特点，提出适合本地区的耕作方法。吉林省榆树县发动三千个互助组“找窍门”，以便集中整理成系统的耕作法，然后加以推广。东北各省正在训练三千三百多名农业技术干部，以便建立一千个农业技术指导站；此外，春耕前全区将有数以百万计的农民获得农业科学技术知识。华北各省也正在大量训练农业技术人员，仅河北省就计划冬、春两季要使一千万人直接间接受到训练。
    但是，目前东北、华北各地对今年大生产的准备工作，发展得还不够平衡。某些地区忽视领导冬季生产，孤立地进行整党、冬训、调查等。某些地区偏重于单纯搞副业生产，忽视农业基本建设。这些都必须从速加以纠正，以便为今年农业丰收打下良好基础。  （新华社）
