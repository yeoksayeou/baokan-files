The armed struggle of the Malayan people against the brutal colonial rule of British imperialism and for national liberation has been going on for more than four and a half years. In the four and a half years since, the British government has spent more than two billion U.S. dollars in its colonial war against the Malayan people. It has used 140,000 British, Australian, New Zealand, Nepalese, Thai, and African troops, as well as a colonial police force of more than 380,000, and all kinds of means including jets, bombers, armored vehicles, artillery, warships, even headhunting savages and German police dogs. In the political field, the British government has also tried its best to organize various puppet institutions to deceive the people, desperately expanded espionage activities, implemented an "identity card" system to strengthen terrorist rule, and supported yellow unions to strengthen enslavement education. However, all these conspiracies and vicious means of British imperialism have been shamefully and one after another defeated in the face of the Malayan people who are resolutely fighting for national liberation.

In order to maintain its colonial rule over Malaya and continue to extract the highest profits, British imperialism sent the special agent Templer to Malaya at the beginning of 1952 to suppress the Malayan people's national liberation movement with even more cruel methods. Shortly after taking office, Templer launched "chemical warfare" against the Malayan people, spraying poison from airplanes over many areas near the jungle to destroy crops in an attempt to cut off the food supply to the Malayan National Liberation Army units stationed in the jungle. At the same time, because his plan to "strengthen military activities" was constantly subjected to powerful blows from the Malayan National Liberation Army, he vented his anger on peaceful residents and implemented the so-called "collective punishment" which aroused the indignation of the people of the world. Initially, he imposed a 22-hour curfew on all villagers in many villages, reducing the already meager food rations by half, and allowing shops to open for only two hours. Later, he became even more vicious, imposing a 24-hour curfew on the residents of some villages, prohibiting any villagers from leaving their houses, forcing villagers to fill out questionnaires and provide information, and after questioning them three times without obtaining the information he wanted, he imprisoned all the residents of the village in concentration camps and burned these villages to the ground.

According to the British colonial government's obviously understated figures, more than 500,000 Malayan people have been imprisoned in concentration camps, which means that one out of every ten Malayan people lives a miserable life in concentration camps. Every morning at six o'clock, rubber tappers are released from the iron gates of the concentration camps to work, and they are not allowed to bring a cup of sweet tea or a piece of bread, but they have to work until two o'clock in the afternoon before they can go home for dinner. When workers work in the rubber plantations, they are often searched or ambushed by British colonial military patrols, and workers are often killed innocently and female workers are raped. People in concentration camps can only get half-full rations, and because the houses are too crowded and the sanitation is too poor, epidemics often occur.

However, all these new brutal measures of Templer have not suppressed the Malayan people's national liberation movement, but have made the Malayan people even more determined to fight against the colonial system and for national liberation. With the British government's implementation of the U.S. "embargo" policy and the continuous pressure of U.S. monopoly capital on the prices of Malaya's two important exports, rubber and tin, Malaya's economic situation has become increasingly deteriorated, the people have become more impoverished, and the number of unemployed has continued to increase. Despite the British colonial government's promulgation of severe fascist anti-labor laws and intensified police terror, at the end of 1952, 10,000 workers in Singapore went on strike to demand increased wages and living allowances. Many patriotic youths have joined the people's armed forces led by the Malayan Communist Party - the Malayan National Liberation Army. The British imperialists have always said that the number of the Malayan National Liberation Army is 5,000, but after four and a half years of constantly boasting about many "victories," they recently said that the National Liberation Army has 7,000 people. This shows that the British imperialists have had to admit that the Malayan National Liberation Army, supported by the broad masses of the Malayan people, is giving the British colonial army increasingly powerful blows. A recent statement by the British colonial government admitted: "There is nothing to suggest that the Communists are not still well-equipped and able to wage war for a considerable period of time."

The Malayan people's struggle for national liberation has received enthusiastic support from peace-loving people all over the world. The Coventry Branch of the British National Union of Sheet Metal Workers, the Manchester and Salford Trades Council, and others passed resolutions in 1952 demanding that British troops withdraw from Malaya and immediately stop the colonial war being waged in Malaya. The Secretary-General of the British Peace Committee issued a statement condemning the British government's crimes of massacring the Malayan people. Hundreds of women in London held a rally to commemorate the fourth anniversary of the Malayan people's national liberation war, passing a resolution demanding an end to the Malayan colonial war and holding a demonstration. The Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference held in Beijing last October, in its "Appeal to the People of the World," "Letter to the United Nations," and "Resolution on National Independence," specifically called for an immediate end to the colonial war waged by British imperialism against Malaya. More than 300 delegates from 37 countries in the Asian and Pacific regions participating in the conference unanimously and enthusiastically supported this demand.

The unprecedented growth of the strength of the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, the brilliant achievements of New China's construction in all aspects over the past three years, and the powerful blows given to the U.S. invading army by the Chinese and Korean People's Army have greatly encouraged the heroic Malayan people in their arduous struggle.

    马来亚人民坚决反对英帝国主义的残暴殖民统治
    马来亚人民反对英帝国主义的残暴殖民统治、争取民族解放的武装斗争，已经进行了四年半多了。四年半以来，英国政府在进攻马来亚人民的殖民战争中，消耗了二十亿美元以上，使用了十四万名英国、澳大利亚、新西兰、尼泊尔、泰国、非洲军队，和一支三十八万多人的殖民警察部队，以及喷气机、轰炸机、装甲车、大炮、军舰，以至猎取人头的野蛮人和德国警犬等一切手段。在政治方面，英国政府也竭力组织各种傀儡机构以欺骗人民，拼命扩大特务活动、实行“身份证”制度以加强恐怖统治，并扶植黄色工会，加强奴化教育等。但是，英帝国主义的这一切阴谋和恶毒手段，在坚决为争取民族解放而进行英勇斗争的马来亚人民面前，都可耻地、一个又一个地失败了。
    英帝国主义为了维持它对马来亚的殖民统治，继续榨取最高额利润，在一九五二年年初派了特务头子田普勒到马来亚，以更残酷的办法来镇压马来亚人民的民族解放运动。田普勒上任不久，就对马来亚人民进行“化学战”，从飞机上向接近丛林的许多地区撒布毒药，破坏谷物，以图断绝驻在丛林内的马来亚民族解放军部队的粮食。同时，由于他的“加强军事活动”计划不断遭受马来亚民族解放军的有力打击，他迁怒于和平居民，实行引起全世界人民公愤的所谓“集体惩罚”。最初他对许多乡村的全村居民实行每天二十二小时的戒严，把本来已经少得可怜的粮食配给再减少一半，商店只许开两小时，后来更加穷凶极恶，竟对一些乡村的居民实行二十四小时戒严，不准任何村民离屋，强迫村民填调查表，供给情报，并在三度盘问而仍得不到他所要的情报后，把全村居民都关进集中营，把这些村庄烧光。
    据英国殖民政府所透露的显然缩小了的数字，马来亚人民被关在集中营里的达五十万人以上，也就是说，每十个马来亚人中就有一个被关在集中营里过着悲惨的生活。每天早晨六点钟，割橡胶工人被放出集中营的铁门去做工，不准他们带一杯甜茶或一块面包，而他们却要工作到下午二时才能回家吃饭。工人们在橡胶园里工作时，还常受到英国殖民军巡逻部队的搜查或伏击，经常有工人被无辜打死，女工被强奸。在集中营里的人们只能得到维持半饱的粮食配给，因为屋子太密，卫生设备太差，常常发生流行疫病。
    但是田普勒的这一切新的残暴手段并未能把马来亚人民的民族解放运动镇压下去，反而使马来亚人民更加坚决地为反对殖民制度、争取民族解放而斗争。随着英国政府推行美国的“禁运”政策，并受到美国垄断资本对马来亚的两种重要输出品橡胶和锡不断压低价格的影响，马来亚经济情况已越来越恶化，人民更加贫困，失业人数不断增加。尽管英国殖民政府颁布有严厉的法西斯反劳工法令，并加紧实行警察恐怖统治，但在一九五二年年底，新加坡一万工人为了要求增加工资和生活津贴而实行大罢工。许多爱国青年都去参加马来亚共产党领导的人民武装力量——马来亚民族解放军。英帝国主义者一向说马来亚民族解放军的人数是五千人，但经过四年半它不断吹嘘了许多“战果”以后，最近却说民族解放军有七千人，这表明英帝国主义者已不得不承认，在马来亚广大人民支持下的马来亚民族解放军正给予英国殖民军队以越来越有力的打击。英国殖民政府最近发表的声明承认：“没有什么可以说明共产党人不是仍然拥有充分良好的装备，而能在相当长时间内进行战争。”
    马来亚人民争取民族解放的斗争，得到全世界各国爱好和平人民的热烈支持。英国全国金属薄板制造工人工会科芬德里分会、曼彻斯特和索尔福的工会理事会等在一九五二年都通过决议，要求英军撤离马来亚，立刻停止在马来亚进行的殖民战争。英国和平委员会秘书长曾发表声明，谴责英国政府屠杀马来亚人民的罪行。伦敦妇女几百人为纪念马来亚人民的民族解放战争四周年，曾举行集会，通过决议要求终止马来亚殖民战争，并举行示威游行。去年十月间在北京举行的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议，在它的“告世界人民书”、“致联合国书”和 “关于民族独立问题的决议”中，都特别提出要求立即停止英帝国主义对马来亚进行的殖民战争。参加会议的亚洲及太平洋区域三十七个国家的三百多位代表一致热烈支持这个要求。
    以苏联为首的和平民主阵营力量的空前壮大，新中国三年来各方面建设的辉煌成就，中朝人民军队给予美国侵略军的有力打击，更是大大地鼓舞了在艰苦斗争中的英勇的马来亚人民。
