    For the Cause of Peace and Security of the Peoples of All Countries
    --February 14 Editorial of the Soviet Pravda
    Today, the Soviet people and the Chinese people, along with all progressive humanity, are celebrating the third anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance with satisfaction.
    Comrade J.V. Stalin's congratulatory message and Comrade Mao Zedong's congratulatory message have been published today.
    Comrade J.V. Stalin's congratulatory message to Comrade Mao Zedong reads as follows:
    "On the occasion of the third anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Aid, please accept my heartfelt congratulations, Comrade Chairman, and may the friendly alliance between the People's Republic of China and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics for the cause of peace and security of the peoples of all countries be further consolidated."
    Comrade Mao Zedong's congratulatory message to Comrade J.V. Stalin reads as follows:

    "On the occasion of the third anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and mutual aid, I extend my heartfelt thanks and warm congratulations to the great Soviet people, the Soviet government and to you, on behalf of the Chinese people, the government of the People's Republic of China and in my own name.
    In the past three years, the close friendly cooperative relationship between the two great allies of China and the Soviet Union has been greatly consolidated and developed. The sincere and selfless assistance provided by the Soviet government and people to the new China has not only accelerated China's economic recovery and development, but is also of great significance to the implementation of China's first five-year plan for large-scale national construction.
    I wish that the great and unbreakable friendship between China and the Soviet Union will be increasingly consolidated and developed in the cause of opposing new imperialist aggression conspiracies and defending peace in the Far East and the world."
    Since the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance came into effect, every year has clearly demonstrated the great vitality inherent in the Leninist-Stalinist principles of Soviet foreign policy. This treaty has consolidated the historically significant ties and guaranteed the further development of the deep and unbreakable friendship and alliance between the peoples of the two great powers of the Soviet Union and China; this alliance, in terms of its impact on the international situation, is unparalleled in human history. The Sino-Soviet Treaty reflects the fundamental changes that have taken place in the international situation since World War II. The broad masses of the Chinese people, fighting for their own liberation, see the Soviet state, born of the great October Socialist Revolution, as their loyal friend, their hope and their example. Thanks to the Soviet Union's defeat of German fascism and Japanese imperialism in World War II, the long and arduous struggle of the Chinese people finally achieved victory.
    The utterly corrupt reactionary Kuomintang regime was overthrown, and the Chinese people were forever freed from imperialist oppression. The People's Republic of China was founded. This historically significant victory of the Chinese people was achieved under the leadership of the glorious Chinese Communist Party and its outstanding leader, Mao Zedong.
    The victory of the Chinese revolution meant a new and most serious breach in the imperialist chain, increased the strength of democracy and socialism, further revolutionized the East, and promoted the upsurge of the liberation struggle of the peoples of various countries oppressed by imperialism.
    As a result of World War II, China and other European people's democratic countries broke away from the capitalist system and, together with the Soviet Union, formed a unified and powerful socialist camp that was opposed to the capitalist camp.
    The alliance and friendship between the Soviet Union and China is an example of a completely new kind of international relations that has never existed before and is impossible in the capitalist world. This relationship is based on the Leninist-Stalinist principles of internationalism, the principle of equal rights, close cooperation and mutual assistance, and the common desire to maintain peace and prevent imperialist aggression.
    The obligations undertaken by the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China under the treaty and agreements of February 14, 1950, have been accurately fulfilled by both sides.
    Over the past few years, the Soviet Union has supplied China with valuable industrial equipment, machinery, and important raw materials and materials worth millions of rubles to restore and develop Chinese industry. On the basis of complete equality between the two sides, the Soviet-Chinese joint companies are developing their work more and more smoothly. The Chinese people are effectively using the Soviet Union's scientific and technical experience and receiving assistance from Soviet experts. The cultural and economic ties between the two countries are growing and expanding day by day.
    China's mutually beneficial trade relations with the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries are developing rapidly. In the course of three years, China's trade volume with these countries has increased from 26 percent to 72 percent of its total foreign trade volume. China is one of the largest members of the new democratic world market. In this market, its member countries find everything they need.
    The experience of economic cooperation among the countries of the new democratic market shows that no capitalist country can provide the kind of assistance to the People's Democratic countries that the Soviet Union provides. Comrade Stalin pointed out in his brilliant work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR": "The problem is not only that this assistance is extremely cheap and technically first-rate. The problem is primarily that the basis of this cooperation is the sincere desire to help each other and to achieve a common economic upsurge."
    The recent unconditional handover of the China Changchun Railway by the Soviet government to the government of the People's Republic of China is a new and significant contribution to the cause of consolidating and developing the fraternal cooperation between the Soviet Union and China. This action once again demonstrates the Soviet Union's high respect for the national sovereignty, rights, and interests of the Chinese people.
    Relying on the friendly assistance of the Soviet Union and on the growing mutually beneficial trade relations with the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries, the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, have made tremendous achievements in transforming their country, completing important tasks of economic and cultural development, and consolidating the country's defense capabilities.
    China's unprecedented national unity has been completed. Except for the island of Taiwan, which is still occupied by American troops and Kuomintang bandits, the entire country is united under the banner of the People's Republic of China.
    In the process of building a new life, the Chinese people have become more closely united, the initiative and awareness of millions of workers have been greatly enhanced, the people's democratic united front of the Chinese people has been further consolidated, and the leading role of the Chinese working class and the Communist Party has been strengthened.
    The completion of economic recovery work, the successful implementation of land reform, the consolidation of the people's democratic regime, and the patriotic unity of the people have created favorable conditions for turning to large-scale planned national construction and for implementing the first five-year plan.
    When defining the urgent tasks of the Chinese people, Mao Zedong pointed out: "We are going to carry out great national construction, and the work before us is arduous, and our experience is insufficient. Therefore, we must earnestly learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union."
    The three years since the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Aid have clearly shown that it is fully in line with the fundamental and vital interests of the peoples of the Soviet Union and China, and that it is of great international significance.
    The Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China have absolutely no aggressive intentions. The Soviet Union and the Chinese people have consistently pursued a policy of struggling for peace and universal security.
    The whole world knows that the Soviet Union, together with the People's Republic of China and all the People's Democratic countries, has been committed in the past and is still committed to consolidating peace and universal security. The Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Aid is fully in line with this peaceful policy. The main task of the treaty is to prevent the re-aggression of Japan or any other country that is directly or indirectly colluding with Japan in aggressive acts. This noble purpose of the treaty is in line with the interests of all progressive humanity and all peace-loving people who desire peace and international cooperation.
    The great significance of the Sino-Soviet Treaty is particularly evident in the increasingly tense international situation as American imperialism intensifies its preparations for a new world war. The United States and its allies are frantically expanding their armaments. American imperialists have concluded a separate treaty with Japanese reactionaries. They are fostering Japanese militarism and turning Japan into their military base. In Korea, after breaking off the peace talks, the American aggressors continue the war and carry out activities to expand the war. American aircraft are increasingly intruding into Chinese airspace. American troops have repeatedly used bacteriological weapons against the peaceful residents of Korea and China. Bestial American troops are constantly and cruelly suppressing prisoners of war. All of this and many other acts of aggression expose the American imperialists as the instigators of a new world war and the vicious enemies of the Asian people and the people of the whole world.
    The American imperialists have repeatedly attempted to hinder China's development and its peaceful construction. But the close alliance between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, and the growing strength of the united and powerful socialist camp, are like a heavy roadblock, blocking the path of the instigators of new wars. All the aggressive plans and conspiracies of the imperialists will be shattered against this roadblock. No matter how frantic the American imperialists, the most vicious enemies of free China, become, no matter what conspiracies they play, and no matter what aggressive adventures they carry out, they cannot stop the Chinese people's powerful and invincible movement toward a bright new life.
    In order to maintain peace, defend the security of their motherland, and support the just struggle of the Korean people against the American aggressors who attacked them, the Chinese people launched a vigorous patriotic movement to resist America and aid Korea. The outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese people joined the Chinese People's Volunteers and fought heroically alongside the Korean People's Army to resist the aggression of American imperialism.
    Comrade Mao Zedong expressed the feelings of the entire Chinese people:
    "We want peace, but as long as American imperialism does not abandon its unreasonable demands and conspiracies to expand aggression, the determination of the Chinese people is to fight alongside the Korean people. This is not because we are bellicose; we are willing to stop the war immediately, and the remaining issues can be resolved in the future. But American imperialism is unwilling to do so. Very well, let us fight. American imperialism is willing to fight for however many years; we are prepared to fight with it for however many years, until American imperialism is willing to give up, and until the Chinese and Korean people have achieved complete victory."
    The imperialist warmongers, seeing the achievements of the free countries of the socialist camp growing day by day, are becoming increasingly desperate and trying to obstruct these countries from living a peaceful life. The imperialists are trying in every possible way to alienate the friendship of the free countries, carrying out slander and spreading rumors to intimidate, organizing counter-revolutionary conspiracies and provocations, and sending spies, subversives, and assassins to the countries of the socialist camp.
    The people of the countries of the camp of democracy and socialism are busy with great peaceful construction, and at the same time are constantly raising their revolutionary vigilance, guarding against the conspiracies and tricks of American imperialism, strengthening the struggle for peace, consolidating their national defense, and uniting more closely with the Soviet Union and the world's forces of peace and democracy.
    The unbreakable fraternal alliance between the Soviet Union and the Chinese people is a precious asset and great hope for all progressive and peace-loving humanity, and will play a powerful role in the cause of further consolidating the camp of peace, democracy, and socialism.
    For the peace and security of the peoples of all countries, may the eternal, great, and unbreakable friendship between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China be constantly consolidated and constantly grow!

    为了各国人民和平与安全的事业
    ——二月十四日苏联真理报社论
    今天苏联人民和中国人民，还有全体进步人类跟他们一道，怀着满意的心情庆祝苏联和中华人民共和国友好同盟互助条约签订三周年。
    约·维·斯大林同志的贺电和毛泽东同志的贺电今天发表了。
    约·维·斯大林同志给毛泽东同志的贺电说：
    “值此中苏友好同盟互助条约签订三周年之际，主席同志，请接受我衷心的祝贺，并祝中华人民共和国与苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟间为着各国人民和平及安全事业的友好同盟获得更进一步的巩固。”
    毛泽东同志给约·维·斯大林同志的贺电说：
    “值此中苏友好同盟互助条约签订三周年之际，我代表中国人民、中华人民共和国政府并以我个人名义谨向伟大的苏联人民、苏联政府和您表示衷心的感谢与热烈的祝贺。
    三年来中苏两大盟国之间的亲密友好合作关系获得了极大的巩固和发展。苏联政府和人民给予新中国的真诚无私的援助，不仅加速了中国经济的恢复和发展，而且对中国大规模国家建设的第一个五年计划的实施，更有其重大的意义。
    祝中苏两国伟大的牢不可破的友谊在反对帝国主义新侵略阴谋、保卫远东及全世界和平的事业中日益巩固与发展。”
    苏中友好同盟互助条约生效以来，每年都昭著地显示了苏联外交政策的列宁—斯大林原则所具有的伟大的生命力。这个条约巩固了具有历史意义的联系，保证了苏中两大国人民深厚的、牢不可破的友谊和同盟得到进一步发展；这个同盟，就它对国际局势的影响来说，在人类历史上是无与伦比的。苏中条约反映了第二次世界大战以后国际局势中发生的根本变化。为自己的解放而斗争的中国人民大众把诞生于伟大的十月社会主义革命的苏维埃国家看作是自己的忠实朋友、自己的希望和榜样。由于苏联在第二次世界大战中击溃了德国法西斯主义和日本帝国主义，中国人民长期艰苦的斗争最后获得了胜利。
    腐败透顶的国民党反动政权被推翻了，中国人民永远摆脱了帝国主义压迫。中华人民共和国成立了。中国人民的这一具有历史意义的胜利是在光荣的中国共产党和它的杰出领袖毛泽东的领导下获得的。
    中国革命的胜利意味着帝国主义锁链中发生了新的最严重的缺口，增加了民主与社会主义的力量，使东方更加革命化了，并促进了受帝国主义压迫的各国人民解放斗争的高涨。
    由于第二次世界大战的结果，中国和其他欧洲人民民主国家脱离了资本主义体系，与苏联一道成立了与资本主义阵营对立的、统一的、强大的社会主义阵营。
    苏联与中国的同盟和友谊是一种完全新的、从来没有过的而且在资本主义世界不可能有的国际关系的范例。这种关系的基础是列宁—斯大林国际主义原则，是权利平等的原则，是密切的合作与互助，是维护和平与阻止帝国主义侵略的共同愿望。
    苏联和中华人民共和国根据一九五○年二月十四日的条约与协定相互承担的义务被双方准确地履行着。
    这几年来苏联供给了中国数以百万卢布计的宝贵工业设备、机器、重要原料与物资，来恢复和发展中国工业。在双方完全平等的基础上，各苏中联合公司越来越顺利地发展着自己的工作。中国人民有效地利用着苏联的科学和技术经验，得到苏联专家的帮助。两国的文化和经济联系一天天成长和扩大。
    中国跟苏联与人民民主国家的互利贸易关系迅速发展着。在三年当中中国对这些国家的贸易额在它的对外贸易总额中从百分之二十六增加到了百分之七十二。中国是新的民主世界市场最大的成员国之一。在这个市场里，它的成员国找到它们所必需的一切。
    新的民主市场各国间经济合作的经验说明：没有一个资本主义国家可以提供像苏联给予人民民主国家的那种援助。斯大林同志在他的天才著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”里指出：“问题不仅在于这种帮助是极度便宜的，技术上是头等的。问题首先在于这种合作的基础，是互相帮助和求得共同经济高涨的真诚愿望。”
    最近苏联政府把中国长春铁路无偿地移交中华人民共和国政府，这在巩固和发展苏中两国兄弟合作的事业上是一个新的重大贡献。这一行动再一次表现了苏联高度尊重中国人民的国家主权、权利和利益。
    中国人民依靠苏联的友好帮助，依靠跟苏联与人民民主国家日益增长的互利贸易关系，在中国共产党和毛泽东同志的领导下，在改造自己的国家、完成经济和文化的重要任务、巩固国家的防御能力方面获得巨大的成就。
    中国空前未有的全国统一已经完成。除了中国的台湾岛还被美国军队和国民党匪帮窃据外，全国都团结在中华人民共和国的旗帜下。
    在建设新生活的过程中，中国人民更紧密地团结起来了，千百万劳动者的积极性和觉悟无比地提高了，中国人民的人民民主统一战线更加巩固了，中国工人阶级和共产党的带头和领导的作用加强了。
    经济恢复工作的完成，土地改革的顺利实现，人民民主政权的巩固，人民的爱国团结，为转向大规模的有计划的国家建设、转向执行第一个五年计划创造了有利的条件。
    毛泽东在规定中国人民的迫切任务时指出：“我们要进行伟大的国家建设，我们面前的工作是艰苦的，我们的经验是不够的，因此，要认真学习苏联的先进经验。”
    中苏友好同盟互助条约签订后的三年十分明显地说明了它是完全符合苏中两国人民的根本切身利益的，说明了它具有重大的国际意义。
    苏联和中华人民共和国完全没有任何侵略意图。苏联和中国人民一贯执行为和平与普遍安全而斗争的政策。
    全世界都知道：苏联跟中华人民共和国和一切人民民主国家在过去和现在一直致力于巩固和平与普遍安全。中苏友好同盟互助条约是完全符合这一和平政策的。条约的主要任务就是不容许日本或其他直接间接在侵略行为上与日本相勾结的任何国家之重新侵略。条约的这种崇高的目的是符合全体进步人类和一切渴望和平与国际合作的爱好和平人民的利益的。
    由于美国帝国主义加紧准备新世界大战，中苏条约的巨大意义在国际局势日趋尖锐的情况下特别明显地显示出来。美国及其同盟者正在疯狂地扩充军备。美国帝国主义者与日本反动派缔结单独条约。他们扶植日本军国主义并把日本变成他们的军事基地。在朝鲜，美国侵略者中断和平谈判之后，继续着战争，进行扩大战争的活动。美国飞机愈益频繁地侵入中国领空。美国军队一再对朝鲜和中国和平居民使用细菌武器。兽性的美国军队不断地残酷镇压战俘。所有这一切以及许多其他侵略行为都揭穿美国帝国主义者是新世界大战的挑拨者，是亚洲人民和全世界人民的恶毒敌人。
    美国帝国主义者一次又一次地企图阻挠中国的发展，阻挠它的和平建设。但是苏联和中华人民共和国的亲密同盟，统一与强大的社会主义阵营日益壮大的力量像一块沉重的拦路石，拦阻着新战争挑拨者的道路，帝国主义者的一切侵略计划和阴谋碰上这块拦路石无不粉碎。自由中国的最凶恶的敌人美国帝国主义者不论怎样暴跳如雷，不论玩弄怎样的阴谋和进行怎样的侵略冒险，都阻止不了中国人民走向灿烂新生活的、强大的、所向披靡的运动。
    中国人民为了维护和平、保卫自己祖国的安全、支持朝鲜人民反对进攻他们的美国侵略者的正义斗争，展开了轰轰烈烈的抗美援朝爱国运动。中国人民的优秀儿女参加了中国人民志愿军部队，与朝鲜人民军并肩英勇战斗，抗击美国帝国主义的侵略。
    毛泽东同志表示全中国人民的心情说：
    “我们是要和平的，但是，只要美帝国主义一天不放弃它那种横蛮无理的要求和扩大侵略的阴谋，中国人民的决心就是只有同朝鲜人民一起，一直战斗下去。这不是因为我们好战，我们愿意立即停战，剩下的问题待将来去解决。但美帝国主义不愿意这样做，那么好罢，就打下去，美帝国主义愿意打多少年，我们也就准备跟他打多少年，一直打到美帝国主义愿意罢手的时候为止，一直打到中朝人民完全胜利的时候为止。”
    帝国主义战争贩子看到社会主义阵营自由国家的成就一天天大起来，气得丧心病狂，便越来越拼命挣扎，妄图阻挠这些国家过和平的生活。帝国主义者百般离间自由国家的友谊，进行毁谤和散布谣言进行吓诈，组织反革命阴谋和挑衅，向社会主义阵营的国家派遣间谍、颠覆分子、暗杀者。
    民主与社会主义阵营国家的人民忙于伟大的和平建设，同时也不断提高自己的革命警惕性，警惕美国帝国主义的阴谋诡计，加强争取和平的斗争，巩固着自己的国防，更加紧密地与苏联和全世界和平民主力量团结起来。
    苏联与中国人民之间的牢不可破的兄弟同盟是全体进步的与爱好和平的人类的宝贵财产和伟大希望，在进一步巩固和平、民主与社会主义阵营的事业中要起有力的作用。
    为了各国人民的和平与安全，苏联与中华人民共和国之间永久的、伟大的、牢不可破的友谊不断巩固与不断增长！
