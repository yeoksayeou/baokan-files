    Minhou Huyuzhen military dependents' model Ye Wenzhang actively engages in production and also cultivates land on behalf of military dependents
    Letter from Ye Wenzhang: I am a revolutionary soldier's family member from Huyuzhen, Fourth District, Minhou County, Fujian. My second son, Ye Zhigui, is a soldier in the People's Liberation Army. In 1951, I responded to the call to resist America and aid Korea, encouraging my three nephews to join the Volunteer Army, which motivated the whole town to enthusiastically launch a military service campaign. Last year, the People's Government called for increased production and thrift, and to improve the yield per unit area. Not only did I refuse to be cared for by others, but I also cultivated land for other military dependents, contributing seventeen workdays. Under my influence, other military dependents also reversed the erroneous idea of ​​relying entirely on cultivation by others. Because of my careful cultivation, I had a bumper harvest last year, with an average yield of 1,100 catties per mu. The masses respect me very much and elected me as a model military family member.
    Now my family is both honored and living a good life. In welcoming the Spring Festival, I guarantee that I will continue to actively respond to the government's various calls, work harder, and increase the yield per unit area to repay the Communist Party and Chairman Mao for their kindness.

    闽侯扈屿镇军属模范叶文掌自己积极生产还替军属代耕
    叶文掌来信：我是福建闽侯县四区扈屿镇一个革命军人家属，次子叶枝贵是人民解放军的战士。一九五一年，我响应抗美援朝的号召，鼓励三个侄孙去参加志愿军，带动全镇热烈展开了参军运动。去年人民政府号召增产节约和提高单位面积产量，我不但不要代耕，还替别的军属代耕了十七个工。其他军属在我的影响下，也扭转了全部依赖代耕的错误思想。由于我精耕细作，去年得到了大丰收，每亩平均产量达到一千一百斤。群众对我非常尊敬，评选我为军属模范。
    现在我家既光荣，生活过得又好。在迎接春节的时候，我保证要继续积极响应政府的各项号召，更加精耕细作，提高单位面积产量，来报答共产党和毛主席的恩情。
