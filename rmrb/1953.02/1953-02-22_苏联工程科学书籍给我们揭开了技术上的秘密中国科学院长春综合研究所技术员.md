Soviet Engineering Science Books Reveal Technical Secrets to Us: Technician Liu Zhengjing, Changchun Institute of Integrated Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences

　　In September 1951, a new set of large die-casting equipment was shipped from abroad to the Shenyang Electric Plant No. 15. During installation, difficulties arose because the drawings and operating instructions had been lost. At that time, we went to the factory to assist with the installation. However, we were not familiar with such machines and could not complete the work. We had to search for various reference books, but after looking through English and Japanese books, we found nothing. Finally, we found reliable reference materials in the Soviet books "Casting Machinery" and "Die-Casting Technology," which enabled us to successfully complete the installation and test run.

　　After the machinery and equipment were installed, the Electric Plant No. 15 encountered another problem, which we were also asked to help solve. The problem was: in order to save a large amount of copper, aluminum had to be used to replace copper in the casting material when manufacturing electric motor rotors. After discussions with relevant parties, it was decided to use the die-casting method to produce electric motor rotors using pure aluminum as the casting material to save a large amount of pure copper. However, when we assisted the factory with this work, we found that pure aluminum easily absorbs iron at high temperatures, which would severely corrode the die-casting chamber components during die-casting. This caused significant difficulties for our work. At this time, we consulted Soviet books, seeking ways to overcome this difficulty. We finally found an article on "Coatings for Die-Casting Chambers." Following the methods indicated in this article, we solved this problem. After the electric motor rotor was successfully manufactured, it was discovered that aluminum sticking occurred on the mold surface during production. We used advanced Soviet methods to overcome this phenomenon. In this way, on the one hand, the trial production of die-cast electric motor rotors was completed ahead of schedule, opening up a new path for electrical engineering technology (using die-casting to save a large amount of pure copper will save the country more than 20,000 tons of grain annually), and on the other hand, electric motor manufacturing technology was improved.

　　We have preserved many English and American engineering science books, but when we consulted them to solve problems, we only found one article related to coatings in a hundred articles. Moreover, its central content only introduced the performance and uses of "colloidal graphite," with the aim of getting people to buy this product, while providing no information on manufacturing methods or data. However, when we consulted relevant Soviet books, we encountered a completely different situation. Soviet books not only provided detailed introductions to the composition, manufacturing methods, characteristics, and application methods of several coatings, but also explained which types of castings they were suitable for, etc. In the eyes of capitalists, this is a "secret" in technical competition, which they cannot tell others! For example, the famous American electric motor manufacturer "Westinghouse" only wrote a number on the coating used in die-casting rotors; it is difficult for people to find out what this number refers to.

　　"Soviet science and technology literature really solves problems!" We shouted this sentence from the bottom of our hearts. We truly recognized the characteristics and strengths of Soviet science and technology books. In order to promote advanced Soviet experience, we have translated two of the more important articles and printed them into pamphlets to send to relevant factories. Our weekly business studies also focus on introducing Soviet experience in die-casting. We have also listed necessary figures such as standard tolerances, angles, aperture, and thread for mold manufacturing in a table and posted it on the wall so that the worker comrades working with us can also learn at any time.

    苏联工程科学书籍给我们揭开了技术上的秘密中国科学院长春综合研究所技术员
  　刘正经
    一九五一年九月，沈阳电工十五厂由国外运到一套新式的大型压铸设备，安装时因图样和使用说明书都已丢失而发生了困难。当时，我们便到该厂协助进行安装工作。但我们不熟悉这样的机器，也无法完成这一工作。我们只得去找各种参考书籍，可是翻遍了英文和日文书，什么材料也没有找见。最后我们在苏联的“铸造机械”和“压铸技术”两本书内，找到了可靠的参考资料，使我们顺利地完成了安装和试车的工作。
    电工十五厂在机器设备安装完毕以后，又遇到了一个难题，这个难题也要由我们协助解决。这个难题是：为了大量地节约铜，在制造电动机转子时，铸料用的铜必须用铝来代替。经和有关各方面讨论，决定试制电动机的转子时采用压铸方法，用纯铝作铸料，以节省大量的纯铜。但我们在协助该厂进行此项工作时，发现纯铝在高温下很容易吸收铁，以至在压铸时将严重地腐蚀压射室的机件。这使我们的工作遭遇到重大的困难。这时，我们便翻阅苏联书籍，寻求着战胜这个困难的方法。我们终于发现了“压射室用涂料”一文。依照这篇文章所指示的方法，我们把这个难题解决了。电动机转子制造成功以后，又发现模具面在生产时发生了粘铝现象，我们又用苏联的先进方法克服了这种现象。这样，一方面提前完成了压铸电动机转子的试制工作，给电工技术开辟了一条新的道路（利用压铸法节省大量的纯铜，每年将为国家节省二万多吨粮食），一方面把电机制造技术提高了一步。
    我们保存着不少的英美的工程科学书籍，但是在为了解决难题来翻阅它们的时候，我们在一百篇文章里面也只找到了一篇是涉及涂料的。而且它的中心内容只是介绍“胶质石墨”的性能和用途，其目的是叫人去买这种商品，而关于制法和数据，则一无所有。可是我们在翻阅苏联的有关书籍时，却遇到了完全另外一种情况。苏联的书籍不仅详尽地介绍了数种涂料的成分、制法、特性及其使用方法，而且说明了适合于那一种铸品，等等。这在资本家看来，正是技术竞争上的“秘密”，那里可以告诉别人！例如，美国著名的电机制造厂“西屋公司”在压铸转子所用的涂料上面，只写着一个号码；人们要去查这个号码是困难的。
    “苏联的科学技术文献真解决问题！”我们从心底喊出了这句话。我们真正认识到苏联科学技术书籍的特点和长处。为了推广苏联的先进经验，我们已将两篇较重要的文章翻译出来了，并把它们印成小册子寄往各有关工厂。我们的每周业务学习，也以介绍苏联有关压铸方面的经验为重点。我们更把一些有关制造模具的标准公差、斜度、孔径、丝扣等必要数字列成表格，贴在墙上，使和我们在一起工作的工人同志也随时可以学习。
