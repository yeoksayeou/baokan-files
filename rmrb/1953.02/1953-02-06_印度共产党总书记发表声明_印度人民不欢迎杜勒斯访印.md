Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, February 5th: Communist Party of India General Secretary Ghosh recently issued a statement saying that the Indian people do not welcome U.S. Secretary of State Dulles' visit to India. Dulles is currently on his "round-the-world inspection tour."

The statement said: "Dulles' recent policy speeches clearly explain the reasons for his visit. The background to this visit is as follows: the US-British proposal on the Kashmir issue has been adopted, and attempts are being made to get Pakistan to join the Middle East 'defense' organization. Dulles' policy speeches are a provocation and insult to the Indian people, and a threat to peace and the freedom of Asia."

The statement concluded: "The hospitality of the Indian people is well-known, but their hospitality is not extended to the enemies of freedom, democracy and peace."

    印度共产党总书记发表声明
    印度人民不欢迎杜勒斯访印
    【新华社新德里五日电】印度共产党总书记高士最近发表声明说，印度人民不欢迎美国国务卿杜勒斯访问印度。杜勒斯目前正在作他的“环球视察旅行”。
    声明说：“杜勒斯最近发表的政策演说，清楚地说明了他这次访问的原因。这次访问的背景是这样的：美英关于克什米尔问题的提案已获通过，企图使巴基斯坦参加中东‘防御’组织的活动正在进行。杜勒斯的政策演说是对印度人民的一种挑衅和侮辱，是对和平和亚洲的自由的威胁。”
    声明最后说：“印度人民的好客是有名的，但是他们的好客并不是对那些自由、民主与和平的敌人的”。
