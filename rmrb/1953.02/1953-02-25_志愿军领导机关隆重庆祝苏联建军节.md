Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, February 24th: The leadership organs of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army held a grand gathering on the 23rd to warmly celebrate the 35th anniversary of the founding of the Soviet Armed Forces. General Yang Dezhi, Deputy Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, General Li Zhimin, Director of the Political Department, and Vice Marshal Choi Yong-kun, Minister of National Defense of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, all delivered speeches at the meeting.

    In his opening remarks, General Li Zhimin first expressed his highest respect on behalf of all commanders and fighters of the Volunteer Army to the great Soviet Army and Marshal Stalin, the defenders of world peace. After recounting the immortal achievements of the Soviet Army, he said: The existence and development of the Soviet Army is a serious blow to the war plots of the American aggressors and a powerful guarantee for world peace. With such an incomparably powerful army vigilantly safeguarding world peace, it is a great encouragement to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, which makes us a hundred times more courageous and confident in defeating the American aggressor troops.

    In his speech, General Yang Dezhi called on all commanders and fighters of the Volunteer Army to learn from the Soviet Army. He said that the Chinese People's Army has always regarded the Soviet Army as its glorious example. Our Chinese People's Volunteer Army is fighting heroically and arduously alongside the Korean People's Army on the Korean front against the American aggressor troops. In order to fulfill our great historical mission of resisting aggression and defending peace, further studying the advanced military science of the Soviet Army and their great patriotism and internationalism is of particular importance to us. Only by conscientiously learning from the Soviet Army can we achieve greater victories in future battles.

    Vice Marshal Choi Yong-kun expressed his heartfelt gratitude for the Soviet Army's immortal feat of liberating the Korean people from the clutches of Japanese imperialism. He said that the fact that the Korean People's Army has been able to become such a strong and modern army in just five years is inseparable from the guidance of Stalin's military science and the shining example of the Soviet Army's heroic struggle. All peace-loving people in the world regard the Soviet Army as their hope. With the direct assistance of the great Chinese people and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, and with the encouragement of the Soviet people and their army, the Korean people and the Korean People's Army will surely win the final victory in the war against aggression.

    On February 23rd, various branches and units of the Volunteer Army held commemoration meetings or forums to warmly celebrate Soviet Army and Navy Day.

    【新华社朝鲜前线二十四日电】中国人民志愿军领导机关在二十三日隆重集会，热烈庆祝苏联武装部队建军三十五周年。中国人民志愿军副司令员杨得志将军、政治部主任李志民将军和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国民族保卫相崔庸健次帅都在会上发表了演说。
    李志民将军在致开会词中，首先代表志愿军全体指挥员、战斗员，向世界和平的捍卫者——伟大的苏联军队和斯大林大元帅表示崇高的敬意。他在叙述了苏联军队的不朽功勋后说：苏联军队的存在和发展，就是对于美国侵略者战争阴谋的一个严重打击，使世界和平得到了有力的保障。有这样一支无比强大的军队正在警惕地保卫着全世界的和平，这对中国人民志愿军是一个莫大的鼓舞，使我们百倍地提高了战胜美国侵略军的勇气和信心。
    杨得志将军在演说中号召志愿军全体指挥员和战斗员向苏联军队学习。他说，中国的人民军队，一向是以苏联军队作为自己的光辉榜样的。我们中国人民志愿军正在朝鲜前线与朝鲜人民军一道，和美国侵略军进行着英勇的、艰苦的战斗。为了完成我们反抗侵略、保卫和平的伟大的历史使命，进一步学习苏联军队先进的军事科学和他们伟大的爱国主义与国际主义精神，对我们就有着特殊重要的意义。只有认真向苏联军队学习，我们才可能在今后的战斗中取得更大的胜利。
    崔庸健次帅对苏联军队从日本帝国主义的侵略魔掌中解放了朝鲜人民的不朽功勋表示衷心的感谢。他说，朝鲜人民军能够在短短五年中成为一支这样壮大的现代化军队，是和斯大林军事科学的指导以及苏联军队英勇斗争的光辉榜样分不开的。全世界爱好和平的人民都把苏联军队看成是自己的希望。朝鲜人民和朝鲜人民军在伟大的中国人民和中国人民志愿军的直接援助之下，在苏联人民及其军队的鼓舞之下，是一定能够争取到反侵略战争的最后胜利的。
    在二月二十三日，志愿军各兵种、各部队分别举行纪念会或座谈会，热烈祝贺苏联陆海军建军节。中国人民志愿军领导机关的“志愿军”报和各部队的报刊都发表纪念文字，介绍苏军情况，号召全军向苏军学习。
