Xinhua News Agency, February 24th: The full text of the confession of Major Roy H. Bley, Ordnance Officer of the First Air Wing of the United States Marine Corps, is as follows:

I am Roy H. Bley, Major in the United States Marine Corps, service number 010450, thirty-nine years old, married, with two children. My home address is 1333 Orange Avenue, Santa Ana, California, USA. I served as the Ordnance Officer of the First Air Wing of the United States Marine Corps in Korea for about five weeks, until I was shot down in North Korea on July 8, 1952.

The following facts about bacteriological warfare are written voluntarily by me.

I arrived at K-3 base in Korea on May 28, 1952, and the next day (29th) was assigned as the Ordnance Officer of the First Air Wing of the Marine Corps. The previous Wing Ordnance Officer had left for the United States in early May 1952, and the position was temporarily handled by a Master Sergeant. The ordnance NCO who was doing his work was named McGarry, and he had been in the position for several months.

On the evening of June 2nd, McGarry and I discussed routine ordnance matters in the ordnance section of the G-4 (Logistics) office. He told me the details of my duties, various problems, and procedures. That evening, he told me the main facts about the wing's ongoing bacteriological warfare at that time.

He said that VMF-513 (Marine Night Fighter Squadron 513), stationed at K-8 base, was dropping germ bombs for the Third Bombardment Wing stationed there. They had started dropping germ bombs in early 1952. The VMF-513 ordnance personnel had been trained and assisted in the use of germ bombs by special weapons personnel from the Third Bombardment Wing. The squadron's weapons were supplied directly from the K-8 base bomb depot, which was entirely managed by Air Force personnel.

Later, in March 1952, VMJ-1 (First Marine Photographic Squadron of the Marine Air Group 33) also began dropping germ bombs. The Group specifically dispatched ordnance personnel to the squadron to establish a special weapons group. Before the squadron used germ bombs for the first time, this group was given two weeks of training by an Air Force special weapons team dispatched from K-8 base. The team included two officers and six soldiers, who taught the ordnance personnel management procedures and storage, security, and other methods. After the squadron first used germ bombs, the team remained in the squadron for two or three weeks to supervise their work and continue to provide guidance.

The first batch of germ bombs supplied to the VMJ-1 squadron was requested from the Air Force 6405th Air Support Wing stationed in Daegu, and the VMJ-1 ordnance personnel—accompanied by Air Force special weapons team personnel—retrieved them from the ammunition supply squadron (543rd) warehouse of that wing in Ulsan.

Security measures were very strict, especially in the early days of using germ bombs at K-3 base (the base of the Marine Air Group 33, in Pohang, Korea). Those who understood the use of germ bombs were limited to some personnel of the Wing Headquarters, the Group Commander, the Squadron Commander, the pilots on flight missions, the Group Ammunition Officer, the ordnance personnel who formed the special weapons group, and the personnel who actually participated in the handling and loading of these weapons onto aircraft.

The supply of germ bombs was handled by the VMJ-1 special weapons group. They contacted the Air Force 6405th Air Support Wing directly with secret priority requests.

On the morning of June 5, 1952, Colonel Clark, the logistics officer of the First Air Wing of the Marine Corps, summoned me to his office. Only he and I were in the room. He asked me how familiar I was with ordnance operations. After discussing several routine ordnance matters, he hesitated for a moment, flipped through some documents on his desk, walked back and forth around his desk several times, and then said, "Bley, now let's talk about the main reason I called you here. It's to discuss the wing's special weapons program—the use of germ bombs." He leaned back against his desk and sat down again, then asked me, "Has McGarry already talked to you about it?" I replied that he had, very briefly. He then said, "In order to make you understand the latest situation regarding the use of germ bombs here, I will tell you a brief history of the previous use of germ bombs."

The Air Force began dropping germ bombs in the early winter of 1951, on the orders of senior authorities in Washington. Initially, B-29s based on Okinawa were used, followed by B-29s from the Third Bombardment Wing at K-8 base (in Gunsan, Korea). Subsequently, fighter planes were also dispatched to use germ bombs, including Marine Air Squadron 513, which was also stationed at K-8 base.

This squadron, which used F7F Tigercat aircraft and belonged to Marine Air Group 33, was used by the Air Force authorities in their bacteriological warfare program for these reasons: they were a night fighter squadron and could drop bombs safely; they were stationed at K-8 base, where they could obtain a supply of germ bombs; at the same time, the senior Air Force authorities decided that if germ bombs were to be used on a larger scale, it would be useful for the Marine Corps Air Wing and themselves to have a Marine Corps squadron do some experimentation and familiarization. This experimentation and familiarization would not only give the flight personnel experience, but also give the ordnance personnel experience in handling details and procedures to assist the Air Force special weapons personnel in the future.

The 513th Squadron began using germ bombs after New Year's Day in 1952. The VMJ-1 squadron was then included in the bacteriological warfare program in March, because: first, they were a service unit primarily engaged in photographic work, and could drop germ bombs without suspicion: they flew all over North Korea in their normal work; their base of operations—K-3 base—had special weapons personnel who could form the core of the personnel needed to manage the germ bombs.

At this point, he paused slightly, then asked me, "What is your opinion on the use of germ bombs?" I said, "Sir, it not only violates my own principles, but will inevitably leave a stain on the honor of the Marine Corps." The Colonel said that he also disagreed with the use of germ bombs, that no one in the Wing agreed with the use of germ bombs, but that we were doing so on the orders of our superiors, and there was no other way than to obey the orders we received.

Colonel Clark then told me that General Jerome, the Commander of the First Air Wing of the Marine Corps, had attended a meeting at the headquarters of the Fifth Air Force in the second half of May, where he accepted a plan. The plan would further expand the use of bacteriological weapons by the First Air Wing of the Marine Corps. After General Jerome returned to K-3 base, he convened a staff meeting. As far as I can remember, those present at the meeting included Deputy Commander General Lemson-Scribner, Chief of Staff Colonel Swiebel, Intelligence Officer Colonel Sturch, Operations Officer Colonel Winter, and himself. General Jerome had a detailed discussion of the plan and assigned work and tasks to each department. It was also decided at the meeting that I, who was scheduled to take office three days later, should be informed of the plan, because as Wing Ordnance Officer, I would have to handle many detailed matters in the logistics department.

Colonel Clark then pointed out that the target areas were also discussed at the meeting. The Joint Operations Center decided to create a contaminated zone in the enemy's rear, traversing the Korean Peninsula and including the enemy's transportation arteries.

Thus, both of our groups—Marine Air Group 33 and Air Group 12—were included in that plan, with the VMJ-1 and VMF-513 squadrons of the 33rd Group continuing on an expanded scale. The F9F (Panther) squadrons of the 33rd Group were preparing for the use of germ bombs, and were in a state of readiness, prepared to drop germ bombs once they received orders from the Joint Operations Center. Air Group 12 of the Marine Corps immediately began small-scale bacteriological warfare, dispatching aircraft to K-8 base to collect germ bombs at that base; and from there to operate until some special allocations arrived from the United States, then we could use germ bombs on a large scale, obtaining germ bomb supplies from their own bomb depot at K-6 base (Pyeongtaek).

Colonel Clark then listed several tasks he wanted me to complete as soon as possible.

Contact the 6405th Air Support Wing in Daegu and arrange a meeting with them to discuss the supply matters for the expanded use of germ bombs at K-3 base, and plan for the eventual supply to K-6 base.

Inspect the storage facilities at both K-3 and K-6 bases.

I also had to inspect the security measures for the bomb depot storing germ bombs at the 33rd Air Group, and at the same time order the ammunition officer of the 12th Air Group to prepare to strengthen security when germ bombs were transferred to that depot for supply. Colonel Clark emphasized the fact that security should be carried out with extreme caution. He emphasized that no written material should be issued by either the logistics department or the ordnance section; all instructions and supervision, except for necessary applications and reports, should be conveyed verbally. Before I left Colonel Clark's office, his last words were: "Bley, I know this is an unpleasant job, but I expect you to do your best to complete your part in this plan."

On June 9, McGarry and I drove to see the ammunition officer of the 33rd Air Group and inspected his facilities for storing germ bombs. The facilities were satisfactory. He explained to me that the germ bombs were requested directly from the Air Force by the special weapons group.

I told him that storage space should be expanded because the rate of use was about to increase, and we would probably be handling two or three times more germ bombs than before.

On June 13, I went to K-6 base to inspect the ammunition depot of the 12th Air Group and talked to the Group Ordnance Officer about his plans for storing germ bombs there in the future.

I asked him if he knew that the 12th Air Group was planning to use special weapons - germ bombs. He replied that the Group Commander, Colonel Gallo, had told him about it about ten days earlier. Colonel Gallo told him that the supply of germ bombs would not be established for several weeks. Before taking charge of the germ bomb supply at K-6 base, the Group would have to send some people to be trained in the management of germ bombs. Colonel Gallo had ordered him to select ten people from his ammunition depot personnel and send them to K-8 base, where they would be given on-the-job training by the Third Bombardment Wing. These ten people should be reliable and considered by him to be able to pass the security personnel review, but at the same time not be important personnel among his regular bomb management personnel. The aforementioned ten people were sent to K-8 base on June 11 and would stay there for about four weeks.

I made an inspection regarding storage measures and intelligence security. I talked about how the VMJ-1 squadron was obtaining germ bombs, but I told him that Colonel Clark and I would be meeting with Air Support Wing personnel in Daegu in a few days, and we would have more news for him after the meeting.

Finally, I ordered him to visit the organization system at K-3 base and, when he had time, to visit their storage methods at K-8 base.

On June 16, I flew to Daegu to discuss with the 6405th Air Support Wing the issue of increasing the supply of germ bombs to the First Air Wing of the Marine Corps. Colonel Clark was unable to go with me. The meeting was held in the office of the Wing Commander. There, I met the Wing's Ordnance Officer.

I learned that since December 1951, the 6405th Air Support Wing had been supplying germ bombs to the Third Bombardment Wing at K-8 base, initially in small quantities, but later in increasing quantities. The supply to K-3 base began in March 1952.

The Wing Commander told me that the Far East Materiel Command had notified him around June 1 that the First Air Wing of the Marine Corps would increase its use of germ bombs at K-3 base and was preparing to establish a germ bomb supply at K-6 base.

I discussed in detail with them all matters relating to application, delivery, codes, types, and reports.

We agreed that the VMJ-1 squadron would continue to request germ bombs on its own until the K-6 base germ bomb depot was established; after the depot was established, all applications from both groups would be handled by me through the headquarters of the First Air Wing of the Marine Corps. This would probably be realized around August. I conveyed all these decisions verbally to Colonel Clark and other relevant officers.

On July 7, Colonel Clark informed me that he was convening a meeting on July 10 of logistics officers, ordnance officers, and some officers of the special weapons group of the VMJ-1 squadron of the 12th Air Group of the Marine Corps and the 33rd Air Group of the Marine Corps to discuss the problems arising from the increased use of germ bombs. The next day, I accompanied Wing Chief of Staff Colonel Swiebel to K-6 base for a preliminary talk with the Ordnance Officer of the 12th Air Group. He told me that he was ready to establish a germ bomb storage facility as soon as the personnel of the group preparing to manage germ bombs had completed their training at K-8 base. This would be realized around July 12.

On the same day, July 8, 1952, while flying back to K-3 base from K-6 base with Colonel Swiebel, we flew off course and were shot down by ground fire in the rear of North Korea.

    美国海军陆战队第一空军联队军械官
    少校罗伊·赫·布莱的供词
    【新华社二十四日讯】美国海军陆战队第一空军联队军械官少校罗伊·赫·布莱的供词全文如下：
    我是罗伊·赫·布莱，美国海军陆战队少校，军号零一零四五零，三十九岁，已婚，有两个孩子。我家在美国加利福尼亚州圣安那市俄兰治大街一三三三号。我在朝鲜美国海军陆战队第一空军联队任军械官约五星期，至一九五二年七月八日我在北朝鲜被击落时为止。
    我下面谈到的关于细菌战的事实，是我自愿写出的。
    我于一九五二年五月二十八日到达朝鲜K—3基地，第二天
    （二十九日）即被派充海军陆战队第一空军联队军械官。前任联队军械官已于一九五二年五月初离职返美，所遗职务由一上士办理。替他做事的那位军械士官姓麦克加里，担任该职已经几个月了。
    六月二日晚，麦克加里和我二人在G—4（后勤处）办公室军械科讨论日常军需事宜。他将我的职务中的详情、各种问题和办事程序告诉了我。那天晚上，他把当时联队进行细菌战的主要实况说给我听。
    他说驻在K—8基地的VMF—513（海军陆战队第五一三夜间战斗机中队）正在替驻在该地的第三轰炸机联队投掷细菌弹。他们在一九五二年初已经开始投细菌弹。VMF—513的军需人员曾由第三轰炸机联队的特种武器人员给予细菌弹使用方面的训练，并予协助。该中队的这种武器均直接由K—8基地炸弹库供应，该炸弹库是全由空军人员管理的。
    后来，一九五二年三月时，VMJ—1（海军陆战队第三十三空军大队的第一海军陆战队照相中队）也开始投细菌弹了。大队特为此事派出军需人员到中队去，成立了一个特种武器组。在该中队第一次使用细菌弹之前，这批人并由从K—8基地派出的空军特种武器小组给予两星期的训练。那个小组包括军官两名和士兵六名，将管理程序和储存、保密等办法教给了这批军需人员。在中队首次使用细菌弹后，那个小组仍留在中队里两三星期，监督他们的工作并继续指导。
    供给VMJ—1中队的第一批细菌弹是向驻在大邱的空军第六四○五空中支援联队申请，并由VMJ—1的军需人员——由空军特种武器小组人员陪同——自该联队的蔚山军火供应中队（第五四三）仓库领取。
    保密办法是非常严格的，尤其是在K—3基地（海军陆战队第三十三空军大队的基地，在朝鲜浦项）使用细菌弹的初期。懂得细菌弹用法的，只有联队司令部的一些人员、大队指挥官、中队指挥官、飞行任务的驾驶员、大队弹库官、组成特种武器组的军需人员，以及实际参与搬运和把这种武器装上飞机的人员。
    细菌弹的供应由VMJ—1特种武器组办理。他们以秘密的优先申请书，直接和空军第六四○五空中支援联队接洽。
    一九五二年六月五日晨，海军陆战队第一空军联队后勤官员克拉克上校召我到他的办公室里。室内只有他和我。他问起我熟习军需业务的进度如何了。讨论了几项日常军需事务后，他踌躇了一会，把桌上一些文件翻了一遍，绕着他的办公桌来回走了几次，然后说：“布莱，现在谈我叫你到这里来的主要原因罢。是为了要讨论联队的特种武器计划——使用细菌弹。”他靠着他的办公桌重又坐下来后，问我：“麦克加里已经和你谈过了吗？”我回答道已经谈过了，很简单地谈过了。这时他说：“为了使你了解这里使用细菌弹的最近情况，我将把以前使用细菌弹的简单经过告诉你。”
    空军开始投掷细菌弹是在一九五一年初冬，奉华盛顿高级当局之命。起初使用以冲绳岛为基地的B—29型机，继之使用K—8基地（在朝鲜群山）的第三轰炸机联队的B—29型机。此后，战斗机也被派使用细菌弹，这包括也驻在K—8基地的海军陆战队第五一三空军中队。
    这个使用F7F虎猫型机的隶属海军陆战队第三十三空军大队的中队之所以被空军当局用在其细菌战计划里面，有这些理由：他们是一个夜间战斗机中队，能够很安全地投弹；他们驻在K—8基地，该处可以取得细菌弹供应；同时，空军高级当局决定：如果细菌弹要扩大规模使用时，让一个海军陆战队的中队来作些实验和熟悉一下，对海军陆战队航空队和他们自己都是很有用的。这种实验和熟悉工作，不但会使飞行人员获得经验，而且也使将来要协助空军特种武器人员办理细节事务和手续的军需人员获得经验。
    第五一三中队在一九五二年元旦后即开始使用细菌弹。VMJ—1中队接着也在三月间被列入细菌战计划之中，因为：第一、他们是以照相工作为主的勤务部队，可以投掷细菌弹而不被怀疑：他们在其正常工作中飞遍北朝鲜各地；他们的驻在地——K—3基地——有特种武器人员，可以组成管理细菌弹所需人员的核心。
    说到这里，他稍停一下，然后问我：“你对使用细菌弹的意见怎样？”我说：“先生，它不但违反我自己的原则，而且必将在海军陆战队的荣誉上留下一个污点。”上校说：他也不同意用细菌弹，联队里没有一个人同意用细菌弹，但是我们是奉上级命令这样做的，除了服从我们所奉到的命令之外，毫无其他办法。
    克拉克上校接着告诉我：海军陆战队第一空军联队司令杰罗姆将军曾于五月下半月在空军第五航空队司令部参加了一次会议，在会议上接受了一项计划。该计划使海军陆战队第一空军联队更进一步地使用细菌武器。杰罗姆将军回K—3基地后，即召开参谋会议。出席会议的，就我记忆所及，有副司令莱姆逊—斯克里布纳将军、参谋长许威布尔上校、情报官员斯特奇上校、作战官员温特上校和他本人。杰罗姆将军曾就计划作了详细的讨论，并布置了给各处的工作和任务。会上并决定须将计划通知定于三日后到职的我，因为我是联队军械官，必需处理后勤处的许多细节事务。
    克拉克上校接着指出，在会议中也讨论了目标区。联合作战中心决定在敌人的大后方造成一条沾染地带，横贯朝鲜半岛，包括着敌人的运输干线。
    这样，我们的两个大队——海军陆战队第三十三空军大队和第十二空军大队——都被包括在那计划之内了，第三十三大队的VMJ—1和VMF—513中队均以扩大的规模继续进行。第三十三大队的F9F型机（豹式）各中队则作使用细菌弹的准备，处于待命状态，准备一旦也会接获联合作战中心的命令投掷细菌弹。海军陆战队第十二空军大队的AD空中侵略者型机立即开始进行小规模的细菌战，派机到K—8基地，在该基地领取细菌弹；并从那里出动，直到某种特别的配发品从美国运到时，我们才大规模使用细菌弹，从他们自己的K—6基地（平泽）炸弹库中获取细菌弹供应。
    克拉克上校于是开列了几项他要我尽快完成的任务。
    与在大邱的第六四○五空中支援联队联系，与他们安排一个会议，讨论K—3基地扩大使用细菌弹的供应事宜，并筹划将来最后对K—6基地的供应。
    检查K—3和K—6两基地的储藏设备。
    我还得检查第三十三空军大队储存细菌弹的炸弹库的保密办法，同时命令第十二空军大队的弹库官准备当细菌弹改在该库建立供应时加强保密。克拉克上校强调一项事实，要以极大的谨慎进行保密。他着重说明：后勤处和军械科都不许发出任何书面东西；除必要的申请和报告外，所有训令与监督均由口头传达。我离开克拉克上校的办公室之前，他的最后一句话是：“布莱，我知道这是一件不愉快的差事，但是我期望你尽力完成你在这计划中的一份工作。”
    六月九日，麦克加里和我乘车去见第三十三空军大队的弹库官，并视察他那里贮藏细菌弹的设备。那些设备是令人满意的。他对我说明：那些细菌弹是由特种武器组直接向空军请领的。
    我告诉他应当扩大储藏空间，因为使用率行将增加，我们大概要经管相当于以前两三倍多的细菌弹。
    六月十三日，我到K—6基地去视察了第十二空军大队的弹库，并和大队军械官谈及他将来要在该库贮藏细菌弹的计划。
    我问他是否知道拟由第十二空军大队使用特种武器——细菌弹。他答称大队长盖洛上校约在十天前已经告诉他了。盖洛上校对他说，细菌弹的供应几周之内还不会建立。在K—6基地掌管细菌弹供应之前，该大队须派出一些人去接受管理细菌弹办法的训练。盖洛上校已经命令他从他的弹库人员中挑选十个人派到K—8基地，让他们在该基地由第三轰炸机联队施以实地见习的训练。这十个人应当是可靠的，并且经他认为能够通过保密人员审查的人，但同时又不是他的正规的炸弹管理人员中的重要人员。上述十人已于六月十一日被派到K—8基地，将在那里逗留约四星期的期间。
    关于贮藏措施和情报保密方面我作了检查。我谈述了VMJ—1中队是怎样取用细菌弹的，但我对他说，克拉克上校和我数天之内便要和空中支援联队人员在大邱开会，开会之后将有更多的消息告诉他。
    最后，我命令他去K—3基地参观该地的组织制度，并在有时间时到K—8基地去参观他们的贮藏办法。
    六月十六日，我飞到大邱和第六四○五空中支援联队商谈对海军陆战队第一空军联队增加细菌弹供应的问题。克拉克上校不能和我一同去。会议在该联队司令官办公室举行。在那里，我会见了该联队的军械官。
    我获悉：自一九五一年十二月起，第六四○五空中支援联队即把细菌弹供给在K—8基地的第三轰炸机联队，初时只供给少量，后来供给数量逐渐增大。对K—3基地的供应，则自一九五二年三月开始。
    该联队司令告诉我，远东物资供应司令部已于六月一日左右通知他，海军陆战队第一空军联队将增加其K—3基地的细菌弹用量，并且准备在K—6基地建立细菌弹供应。
    我详尽地和他们讨论了所有关于申请、交付、暗码、类型和报告的事情。
    我们同意，在K—6基地细菌弹库未设立前，VMJ—1中队将继续自行请领细菌弹；该弹库设立后，则两个大队的所有申请均通过海军陆战队第一空军联队司令部由我经办。这大概会在八月左右实现。我把所有这些决定都用口头传达了给克拉克上校和其他有关军官。
    七月七日，克拉克上校通知我，他正在召集海军陆战队第十二空军大队和海军陆战队第三十三空军大队后勤官员、军械官和VMJ—1中队特种武器组的一些军官在七月十日举行会议，讨论因增加细菌弹用量而发生的问题。第二天，我偕同联队参谋长许威布尔上校赴K—6基地，与第十二空军大队的军械官作了初步谈话。他对我说，他一俟准备管理细菌弹的小组人员在K—8基地受训完毕，他就准备建立一处细菌弹贮藏设备。这将在七月十二日左右实现。
    同日，一九五二年七月八日，在偕同许威布尔上校自K—6基地飞返K—3基地途中，我们飞错航线，在北朝鲜后方被地面炮火击落。
