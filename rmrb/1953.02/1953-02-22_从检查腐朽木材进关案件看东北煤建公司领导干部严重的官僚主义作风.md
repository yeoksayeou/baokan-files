From the Investigation of the Case of Rotten Wood Entering Customs, We See the Serious Bureaucratic Work Style of Leading Cadres of the Northeast Coal Construction Company
Supreme People's Procuratorate Prosecutor Zhang Yunwen Secretary Zhou Xinming

    The revelation of the Northeast Coal Construction Company's supply of rotten wood is by no means accidental. The leaders of the Northeast Coal Construction Company not only have a serious bureaucratic work style, but also a serious sense of arrogance and complacency. Some specific facts we encountered during the investigation of this case can fully illustrate this point.
    On July 18, 1952, when we first spoke with Liu Shizhen, manager of the Northeast Coal Construction Company, and Xie Yutian, deputy manager, Manager Liu was completely unaware of the major task of importing 500,000 cubic meters of wood. He said that he was "tiger hunting" outside during the "Three-Anti" campaign and knew nothing about this matter in the company. Deputy Manager Xie spoke vaguely about some unimportant matters and believed that there were no problems with the imported wood. Later, the company convened a meeting of the heads of the Shenyang and Harbin Coal Construction Companies to report. Because their work was not thorough enough, they could not discover any problems. In particular, they believed the false information reported by Lu Ximing, director of the Xinyang Office of the Harbin Coal Construction Company, who said that they were increasing the output rate on the premise of ensuring quality. At this time, they did not humbly accept the inspection and completely lacked a realistic and truth-seeking attitude and the attitude of facing up to their mistakes.
    Thanks to the active support and assistance of the broad masses of employees, and through repeated pilot measurements and various symposiums, many specific facts were further revealed and confirmed. For example, after the Northeast Coal Construction Company and the China Coal Construction Company signed a contract for the import of 500,000 cubic meters of wood, they put the contract on the shelf and did not seriously arrange the work in accordance with the spirit of the contract. At the managers' meeting of various provinces and cities, they did not discuss how to complete such a major task. Deputy Manager Xie Yutian only mentioned this task to everyone at the end of the meeting; he did not mention how to ensure specifications and quality. The company's business section only sent Xue Boqin and Li Yaoge, corrupt elements who were exempted from criminal punishment in the "Three-Anti" campaign, to handle such a major task. When Xue Boqin arranged the work of importing 4,000 cubic meters of wood for the Nancha Office, he only notified them by long-distance telephone and did not specifically explain the task. As a result, the quality of this batch of wood was very poor, and it was severely criticized in a letter from a reader in the People's Daily on June 25 last year after it was transported to Shijiazhuang. The Shenyang and Harbin Coal Construction Companies blindly accepted processing tasks and did not even know the quality specifications of the imported wood. The higher-ups did not specifically deploy and explain the tasks to the lower-level units, and the lower-level units did not ask the higher-level units for instructions and reports, resulting in a very chaotic implementation situation. Thirty-eight timber factories in Shenyang City were issued wood for processing by the Shenyang Coal Construction Company, but the city's Coal Construction Company did not have anyone specifically in charge of this work. The No. 2 and No. 3 Building Materials Factories under the city's Coal Construction Company were piled up with a large number of logs, but because they did not organize truck transportation well, many processing factories could not receive wood, forming a serious situation of work stoppage and waiting for materials. What is particularly serious is that under the guidance of the Northeast Coal Construction Company's erroneous management ideology, the city's Coal Construction Company actually signed a processing contract with private timber factories requiring the output rate to be increased to 90%. Some private timber factories (such as the Huaxing Factory) even increased the output rate to 97%. How could the quality of the wood cut like this not be low! Many timber factories in the city, because they could not receive processing fees, jointly wrote reports to the CPC Shenyang Municipal Committee and the Shenyang Municipal People's Government, but the leading cadres of the city's Coal Construction Company used the excuse that the Municipal Finance and Economic Committee had not approved it and dragged on for several months without paying, directly and indirectly affecting the lives of the timber factory workers, which had a very bad political impact.
    When we first arrived in Harbin, Wang Chuansheng, deputy manager of the Harbin Coal Construction Company, said: "From my point of view, less than 1% of the imported wood does not meet the specifications." Lu Ximing, director of the Xinyang Office, even said: "In the past, the worst wood we imported met the specifications of fourth-grade timber." However, after the inspection team's measurement, the facts were just the opposite. 19.1% of the wood imported by the company did not meet the specifications. The proportion of using old wood to replace new wood for import was 50.6%. Ding Baosheng, director of the company's No. 1 Timber Factory, ignored these facts and deceived himself by saying: "I don't know the quality of the old wood of public size, and the technicians below only admit that 0.5% to 0.7% is unqualified." Ding Baosheng also said to the employees: "When dealing with the people from the inspection team, talk when necessary, and don't talk when not necessary." As a result, the employees of the factory had concerns in their minds when approaching us. When we asked for a report, they couldn't produce it for a week.
    When we went deep into the forest area to understand the quality of logs, we also encountered unreasonable obstacles from some bureaucratic elements. For example, Gu Yudian, director of the Jiamusi Timber Yard, did not understand the situation below on weekdays, but at the symposium, he talked eloquently and said: "I guarantee that the quality of the logs issued by our yard will only exceed the standard and will not be reduced." In fact, 32.5% of the logs issued by the yard were unqualified. Qiao Ziying, director of the Tieli Branch of the Suihua Forestry Administration Bureau of Heilongjiang Province, claimed that he did not understand the situation and did not say a word at the meeting. The inspection team invited him to participate in the summary report meeting three times, but he said: "I will not participate in that accompanying execution meeting." These people adopted such an arrogant attitude towards the people sent by the Supreme People's Procuratorate.
    It was not until we had grasped the specific materials of several main situations in the case of rotten wood entering customs that the attitude of the leaders of the Coal Construction Company changed slightly. Lu Ximing, director of the Xinyang Office, said: "We were bureaucratic before, and we will never dare to be again." But although they said so verbally, in fact, they were still unwilling to face up to their mistakes. This is reflected in the fact that they only admit abstract and trivial errors, but deny the main and principled issues. The most prominent is that the specific facts have proved that the blind increase in the output rate and the sale of construction timber were the direct instructions and support of Xie Yutian, deputy manager of the Northeast Coal Construction Company, but Xie flatly denied it. Liu Shizhen, manager of the Northeast Coal Construction Company, said: "The facts you investigated exist, but there are discrepancies in the figures." But how much the discrepancy was, because he was relying on subjective speculation, he naturally couldn't say, so he had to say: "It's not that I don't believe the opinion of the inspection team, but because we don't understand it well, and the people below can't pass it." Now, after further inspections in Beijing, Tianjin and other places, the facts have proved that the figures we obtained in the Northeast are not only close to reality, but also quite conservative.
    Through this inspection of the rotten wood entering customs case, we have increasingly realized that bureaucracy is a hotbed for breeding various errors, a major enemy of our national construction cause, and we have also increasingly realized the importance of regularly and deeply inspecting the work of enterprise departments.

    从检查腐朽木材进关案件看东北煤建公司领导干部严重的官僚主义作风
    最高人民检察署检察员　张允文书记员　周新铭
    东北煤建公司供应腐朽木材的事件被揭发了，这决不是偶然的。东北煤建公司的领导者不仅存在着严重的官僚主义作风，而且存在着严重的骄傲自满的情绪。我们在检查该案当中所接触到的一些具体事实，可以充分说明这一点。
    一九五二年七月十八日，我们第一次和东北煤建公司经理刘士珍、副经理谢雨天等谈话时，刘经理对五十万立方公尺木材进关这样重大的任务竟莫名其妙。他说，因“三反”外出“打虎”，完全不知道公司里还有这么回事。谢副经理则泛泛地谈了一些无关紧要的话，并认为进关木材没有什么问题。以后，该公司召集沈阳、哈尔滨两市煤建公司的负责人汇报。由于他们的工作极不深入，也就不能发现问题。特别是他们相信了哈尔滨市煤建公司新阳办事处主任卢席明汇报的假情况，说他们是在保证质量的前提下提高出材率的。这时候他们并没有虚心接受检查，并且完全缺乏实事求是和正视错误的态度。
    由于广大职工群众积极支援和帮助我们的工作，通过反复地试点测量和召开各种座谈会，进一步揭发和证实了许多具体事实。例如东北煤建公司和中国煤建公司订立五十万立方公尺木材进关合同后，即把合同束之高阁，并没有认真地根据合同的精神切实布置工作。他们在各省、市经理业务科长会议上，并没有讨论如何完成这样重大的任务。副经理谢雨天只是将这个任务在会后附带向大家提了一提；对于应该怎样保证规格质量则毫未提起。该公司业务科只派了在“三反”中免予刑事处分的贪污分子薛伯钦、李耀阁去办理这么重大的任务。薛伯钦在布置南岔办事处四千立方公尺木材进关的工作时，只用长途电话通知一声完事，并没有具体地交代任务，结果这批木材的质量很坏，运到石家庄后，受到去年六月二十五日人民日报读者来信的严厉批评。沈阳、哈尔滨两市煤建公司盲目接受加工任务，对进关木材的质量规格竟不知道。上级没有向下级具体布置和交代任务，下级也没有向上级请示报告，以致执行的情况非常混乱。沈阳市有三十八家木材厂由沈阳市煤建公司发给木材加工，但该市煤建公司却没有专人担任这一工作。该市煤建公司所属第二、第三建材厂都堆积着大批原木，但因为没有很好地组织大车运输，以致很多加工厂领不到木材，形成了严重的停工待料现象。尤其严重的是，该市煤建公司在东北煤建公司错误的经营思想指导之下，竟和私营木材厂订立要求出材率提高到百分之九十的加工合同。有的私营木材厂（如华兴厂）甚至把出材率提高到百分之九十七。像这样割出来的木材，质量怎能不低！该市很多木材厂因领不到加工费，纷纷联名向中共沈阳市委、沈阳市人民政府写报告，但该市煤建公司领导干部竟借口市财政经济委员会没批准，拖着几个月不发，直接间接影响了木材厂职工的生活，政治影响很坏。
    我们初到哈尔滨时，哈尔滨市煤建公司副经理王传圣说：“从我思想上讲，进关木材不合规格的还不到百分之一。”新阳办事处主任卢席明甚至说：“过去我们进关的最差的木材也合乎四等材的规格。”但经检查组测量结果，事实恰恰相反。该公司进关木材有百分之十九点一不合规格。以陈材顶新材进关者占百分之五十点六。该公司第一木材厂主任丁宝生抛开这些事实，还自欺欺人地说：“公大号陈材质量我不知道，下面技术员只承认有百分之零点五到零点七不合格”。丁宝生还向职工说：“对检查组的人，有必要的谈，没有必要的不要谈。”以致该厂职工和我们接近时思想上有顾虑，我们要一张表报，他们搞了一个星期还搞不出来。
    我们深入林区去了解原木质量，也碰到了一些官僚主义分子的无理阻碍。如佳木斯贮木场场长顾裕典平日对下面情况不了解，但在座谈会上却夸夸其谈地说：“我保证本场发出原木质量只有超过不会降低。”事实上该场发出的原木有百分之三十二点五不合格。黑龙江省绥化林业管理局铁骊分局局长乔子英推说不了解情况，开会时一言不发，检查组三次邀请他参加总结汇报会，他竟说：“我就不参加那个陪绑会。”这些人对于最高人民检察署派去的人竟采取了这种傲慢态度。
    直到我们掌握了腐朽木材进关案件几个主要情况的具体材料后，煤建公司的领导者们的态度才稍有转变。新阳办事处主任卢席明说：“以前我们官僚主义，以后再不敢了。”但他们口头上尽管是这样说，事实上却仍是不愿正视错误。这表现在他们只是承认抽象的枝节的一些错误，而否认主要的原则性的问题。最突出的是，具体事实已经证明，盲目提高出材率和抽卖建筑材，是东北煤建公司副经理谢雨天直接指示和支持的结果，但谢却矢口否认。东北煤建公司经理刘士珍说：“你们调查的事实是存在的，但数目字有出入。”但究竟出入多少，因为他是凭主观推测，当然说不出来，于是只好说：“我不是不相信检查组的意见，而是因为我们没有很好了解，下面都通不过。”现在，又经过在北京、天津等地的检查，事实证明我们在东北得到的数字不仅接近实际，并且还是相当保守的。
    通过这次朽木进关案件的检查，我们愈加认识到官僚主义是滋长种种错误的温床，是我们国家建设事业的大敌，同时也愈加体会到经常地深入地检查企业部门的工作的重要性。
