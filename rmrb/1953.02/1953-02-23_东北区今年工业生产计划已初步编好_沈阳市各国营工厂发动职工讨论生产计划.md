Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, February 21st: The Northeast Region has initially drafted the production plan for state-owned and locally-owned state industries for 1953. According to this plan, the total industrial output of state-owned enterprises in Northeast China this year will increase by 23 percent compared to last year, and the total industrial output of local state-owned enterprises will increase by 40 percent compared to last year. The output of major industrial products will increase significantly compared to last year, with pig iron increasing by 11 percent, steel ingots by 25 percent, steel products by 32 percent, a certain special steel by 59 percent, and total power generation by 44 percent.

This year's industrial production plan in the Northeast Region is based on the needs of large-scale national construction and the possible production conditions of various factories and mines. Most of the production targets in the plan are formulated according to average advanced technical and economic norms and national task indicators. The plan's greatest feature is that, based on the problems existing in last year's production, it proposes measures to strengthen safe production, balanced production, and improve quality to ensure the comprehensive completion of the national production plan. The plan implements the policy of safe production, requiring all factories and mines to attach importance to the safety and health of workers in terms of ideology, organization, system, and equipment. All factories and mines have formulated various specific measures and guarantees. For example, in addition to carrying out extensive publicity and education among the workers, the Anshan Iron and Steel Company also runs short-term training classes for security work cadres, training security work cadres from various grassroots organizations in rotation to strengthen security work. The Northeast Electric Power Administration and its affiliated electric power bureaus guarantee the elimination of fatal accidents this year. The Administration plans to compile last year's major accidents into propaganda pictures and display them on-site in various locations to educate all electric power workers to strictly abide by various safety operating procedures and systems. For example, the Northeast Coal Mine Administration instructed its affiliated coal mine bureaus to add ventilation sections to specifically manage mine ventilation; miners are required to use safety lamps for lighting when going down the mine. Coal mine bureaus in Xi'an, Fuxin, Hegang, and other places plan to build 22 grouting fire extinguishing projects and seven water-sand filling projects to prevent gas explosions and roof collapse accidents.

The plan specifically requires overcoming the "loose at the beginning and tight at the end" phenomenon in production, and completing the production plan in a balanced and rhythmic manner. Therefore, many factories and mines have decided to vigorously promote the advanced experience of "organizing rhythmic production according to indicator charts." For example, the Northeast Nonferrous Metal Industry Administration plans to focus on promoting this advanced experience in the Huangtong Mine, Huanren Mine, and Tianbaoshan Mine, and then promote it universally after gaining experience. In the past, the tunneling work of various coal mines in the Northeast Region could not keep up with production requirements, and most coal mines lacked working faces in the pits, which often affected continuous production. This year, they plan to vigorously promote the advanced experience of "fast tunneling" to improve tunneling efficiency and ensure sufficient working faces for balanced production.

The plan strictly requires improving the quality of products, and many factories and mines have formulated specific measures. For example, all state-owned rubber factories stipulate that products that do not meet the standards will be stopped from leaving the factory. The Northeast Fourth, Sixth, and Eighth Rubber Factories originally conducted finished product inspections every few days, but now they have increased the frequency to at least one or two finished product inspections per day. The Northeast Building Materials Industry Administration decided to do a good job in mixing, measuring, and testing mixed cement materials to reverse the fluctuation of mixed cement quality and improve the quality of mixed cement. The plans of various factories and mines are now being submitted to the central competent departments for review and approval.

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, February 19th: After full preparation, state-owned factories in Shenyang City launched a comprehensive discussion among workers on the 1953 production plan in early February. Before mobilizing workers to discuss the plan, each factory first conducted publicity and education and ideological mobilization among all workers regarding the three major tasks of the country in 1953, so that the workers clearly understood the relationship between resisting America and aiding Korea and the large-scale national economic construction, the relationship between capital construction and production, and the significance of further tapping potential and ensuring the overfulfillment of the national plan. In the past, some workers believed that "large-scale construction has begun, and the resistance against America and aid Korea can be relaxed"; and some workers believed that the large-scale national economic construction was only the affair of the capital construction department and had little to do with the production department. They said, "Last year I watched the machine, and this year I still watch the machine. There is nothing large-scale or not." These erroneous ideas have been criticized in the ideological mobilization stage, and most of the workers have realized that it is necessary to further develop the increase production and practice economy movement to accumulate more funds and produce more machines to support the large-scale economic construction of the country.

After the ideological mobilization stage, the factory leaders promptly guided the enthusiasm of the workers to discuss the plan, find key tricks, and tap potential. Because the factories in Shenyang City had tapped great potential in the increase production and practice economy movement in the past two years, many workers thought that the potential had been "almost" tapped, showing blind complacency or lack of confidence. Therefore, this year, the struggle between new and old ideas among the workers in finding tricks and tapping potential is even more intense. The production task of the lead electrolysis workshop of the Shenyang Smelter this year has increased by 42 percent compared to last year. Two foremen and some workers said that it was necessary to increase the number of lead melting pots, but at the same time, many advanced workers advocated trying to improve the equipment utilization rate of the existing lead melting pots without adding equipment. At first, the two sides debated, but the ideologically advanced workers finally found a trick from studying the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, changing the operating method of loading one pot of material and discharging one pot of lead in the past to the continuous operation method of discharging lead while loading material, which doubled the daily output. After the copper smelting workshop of the factory created the "high blast smelting method for rapid copper smelting" last year, the actual recovery rate of copper reached 86 percent. This year, the national plan requires it to be increased to 88 percent. Some workers with conservative ideas thought it would be difficult, but after the struggle between new and old ideas, advanced ideas finally overcame backward ideas, and the workers found new tricks to enrich and improve the "high blast smelting method for rapid copper smelting," so that the actual recovery rate of copper reached 90.04 to 91 percent. Those factories that have done a better job in finding tricks and tapping potential have formulated their workshop, group, and individual guarantee plans more advanced, practical, and feasible, and have formulated specific technical measures plans. For example, after detailed discussion by the workers, the second workshop of Factory 53 formulated a guarantee plan to complete the annual production task 33 days ahead of schedule.

    东北区今年工业生产计划已初步编好
    沈阳市各国营工厂发动职工讨论生产计划
    【新华社沈阳二十一日电】东北区已初步编制出一九五三年国营和地方国营工业的生产计划。按照这个计划的规定，东北区今年的国营工业总生产量比去年提高百分之二十三，地方国营工业总生产量比去年提高百分之四十。其中主要工业产品的产量比去年都增加很多，计生铁增加百分之十一，钢锭增加百分之二十五，钢材增加百分之三十二，某种特殊钢材增加百分之五十九，发电总量增加百分之四十四。
    今年东北区的工业生产计划是根据国家大规模建设的需要和各厂矿可能的生产条件而编制的。计划中各项生产指标绝大部分都是按照平均先进技术经济定额和国家要求的各项任务指标制订的。计划的最大特点是根据去年生产中存在的问题，提出了加强安全生产、均衡生产和提高质量等措施，以保证全面地完成国家生产计划。计划贯彻了安全生产方针，要求各厂矿从思想上、组织上、制度上、设备上重视职工的安全和健康。各厂矿都制订了各种具体措施和保证办法。如鞍山钢铁公司除在职工群众中展开广泛的宣传教育外，并开办保安工作干部短期训练班，轮流训练各基层组织的保安工作干部，加强保安工作。东北电业管理局所属各电业局保证今年消灭死亡事故。该管理局计划将去年的重大事故编绘成宣传图画，到各地现场巡回展览，教育全体电业职工，严格遵守各种安全操作规程制度。又如东北煤矿管理局指示所属各煤矿局增设通风科，专门管理矿井通风事情；矿工下井一律改用安全灯照明。西安、阜新、鹤岗等煤矿局则计划建筑灌浆消火工程二十二件，水砂充填七件，严防瓦斯爆炸和塌顶事故。
    计划特别要求克服生产中的“前松后紧”的现象，均衡地有节奏地完成生产计划。所以许多厂矿已决定大力推广“按指示图表组织有节奏生产”的先进经验。例如东北有色金属工业管理局今年计划在黄铜矿、桓仁矿、天宝山矿三个有色金属矿重点推广这一先进经验，取得经验后再普遍推广。东北区各煤矿过去因掘进工作总赶不上生产要求，多数煤矿坑内工作面缺乏，常常影响持续生产，今年他们计划大力推广“快速掘进”的先进经验，提高掘进效率，保证有足够的工作面，以便进行均衡生产。
    计划严格要求提高产品的质量，许多厂矿订出了具体措施。例如各国营橡胶工厂规定产品质量达不到标准时，停止出厂。东北第四、第六、第八三个橡胶厂原来每隔几天进行一次成品检查，现在增加到每天至少进行成品检查一次到两次。东北建筑材料工业管理局决定做好混合水泥材料的搀和计量和化验工作，以扭转混合水泥质量的波动情况，提高混合水泥的质量。现在各厂矿的计划正在呈请中央各主管部门审核批准中。
    【新华社沈阳十九日电】沈阳市各国营工厂经过充分的准备以后，已在二月初发动职工全面地讨论一九五三年的生产计划。各厂在发动职工讨论计划之前，首先向全体职工作了关于一九五三年国家三大任务的宣传教育和思想动员，使职工群众明确地认识了抗美援朝和国家大规模经济建设的关系、基本建设和生产的关系，以及进一步挖掘潜力、保证超额完成国家计划的重要意义。过去，有些工人曾经认为“大规模建设开始了，抗美援朝可以松口气”；又有些工人认为国家大规模经济建设只是基本建设部门的事情，和生产部门没有多大关系，他们说：“去年看机台，今年还是看机台，没有什么大规模不大规模”。这些错误思想在思想动员阶段中都已受到批判，绝大部分职工都认识到：必须进一步开展增产节约运动，积累更多的资金和生产更多的机器来支援国家大规模的经济建设。
    经过思想动员阶段以后，各厂领导方面及时地把职工群众的热情引导到讨论计划和找关键性的窍门、挖潜力的方面来。由于沈阳市各厂在过去两年的增产节约运动中都曾挖掘出很大潜力，不少职工以为潜力已经挖得“差不多”了，表现出盲目自满或信心不足，因此，今年各厂职工在找窍门、挖潜力当中的新旧思想斗争就更为剧烈。沈阳冶炼厂铅电解车间今年的生产任务比去年提高了百分之四十二，有两个班长和一部分工人都说非增加熔铅锅不行，但同时也有不少先进工人主张设法提高现有熔铅锅的设备利用率，不增加设备。起初双方争论不决，但思想先进的工人终于从学习苏联先进经验中找到了窍门，把过去装一锅料出一锅铅的操作方法，改为边出铅边装料的流水作业法，使日产量提高了一倍。该厂真吹炉车间去年创造了“大风流渣快速炼铜法”后，铜的实收率达到百分之八十六，今年国家计划要求提高到百分之八十八，一部分有保守思想的职工认为有困难，但经过新旧思想的斗争，先进思想终于战胜落后思想，工人们找出新的窍门，充实与提高了“大风流渣快速炼铜法”，使铜的实收率达到百分之九十点零四到九十一。这些把找窍门、挖潜力的工作做得较好的工厂，他们的车间、小组和个人的保证计划，就订得比较先进和切实可行，并且都订出具体的技术措施计划。例如五三工厂第二车间经过职工的详细讨论，就订出保证计划，预定提前三十三天完成全年的生产任务。
