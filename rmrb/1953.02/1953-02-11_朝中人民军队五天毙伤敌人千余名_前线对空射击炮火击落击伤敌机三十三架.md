Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 10th: In the first five days of February, the Korean and Chinese People's Volunteers repelled multiple enemy incursions in several areas along the front lines.

On the morning of the 3rd, in a blocking action near Wujin-ri and Jingu-ri, northwest of Gaolangpu-ri on the western front, our forces eliminated 89 enemies and destroyed or damaged five enemy tanks and two aircraft. The enemy forces involved in this incursion were from the 1st Division of the United States Marine Corps. Following an artillery barrage, their infantry, under the cover of tanks and aircraft, approached our positions. Two platoons of enemy soldiers, advancing towards the eastern hill of Jingu-ri and the western hill of Wujin-ri, were quickly repelled by our forces. Another two platoons of enemy soldiers, attacking the northeast hill of Jingu-ri, briefly entered one of our forward positions during their second assault; however, a counterattack by our forces drove the enemy out of this position. The retreating enemy did not even have time to recover their dead.

During these five days, our night raid teams were quite active, launching more than ten attacks, eliminating over 360 enemies. On the night of the 2nd, a strong night raid team, in close coordination with artillery fire, inflicted another heavy blow on the forces of the Rhee Syngman (ROK) 12th Division, which had just been transferred to that area. In this raid, our forces eliminated over 240 enemies, destroyed five enemy tanks, and six vehicles. Our night raid team then calmly returned to its own positions after completing its combat mission. Before dawn on the 5th, another night raid team on the eastern front quickly stormed into the position of a Rhee Syngman platoon south of Gao Cheng, and in a 20-minute battle, completely annihilated a platoon of the Rhee Syngman 15th Division.

From February 1st to 5th, our mobile artillery fire on the front lines killed or wounded 736 enemy soldiers. Our anti-aircraft artillery fire on the front lines shot down 14 enemy planes and damaged 19.

    朝中人民军队五天毙伤敌人千余名
    前线对空射击炮火击落击伤敌机三十三架
    【新华社朝鲜前线十日电】在二月份头五天中，朝中人民部队在前线几个地方击退了敌人多次窜扰。
    三日早晨，在西线高浪浦里以西偏北的乌金里、金谷里附近的一次阻击战中，我军歼灭敌人八十九名，击毁击伤敌军坦克五辆，飞机二架。这次窜扰的敌人是美国海军陆战队第一师的部队。敌人在炮击之后，他们的步兵便在坦克、飞机的掩护下向我军阵地逼近。分向金谷里东山、乌金里西山进攻的两个排敌人，当时很快就被我军击退。另外向金谷里东北山进攻的两个排敌人，在第二次冲锋时一度进入我军的一个前沿阵地；但我军一个反击，便将敌人逐出这个阵地。溃退的敌人连尸首也来不及搬运回去。
    这五天中，我军的夜袭队相当活跃，出击在十次以上，计歼敌三百六十多名。二日夜间，我军一支强大的夜袭队在炮火密切配合下，使刚调到那里的李伪军第十二师的部队又遭到了一次痛击。在这次袭击战中，我军共歼敌二百四十多名，击毁敌坦克五辆，汽车六辆。当时我夜袭队在完成战斗任务后即从容回到自己阵地。五日黎明前，东线我军另一支夜袭队迅速袭入高城以南李伪军一个排的阵地，战斗二十分钟，即将李伪军第十五师的一个排全部歼灭。
    自二月一日到五日，前线我军游动炮火击毙击伤敌军七百三十六名。前线我军对空射击炮火击落敌机十四架，击伤敌机十九架。
