    The Ministry of Agriculture Again Issues a Circular
    Strictly Prevent Misuse and Accidental Injury When Using Pesticides
    The Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government recently issued a circular, again requesting all regions to strictly prevent incidents of accidental injury and misuse when using pesticides. Regarding this issue, the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government has repeatedly instructed in the past that leading cadres at all levels must pay attention, strictly control, and concentrate use, and has required all regions to establish strict inspection systems, formulate specific usage and storage methods, try to organize farmers to purchase collectively, universally impart usage and storage techniques, and seriously handle poisoning incidents. However, to date, a small number of local leading cadres still have a bureaucratic work style, and have not implemented strict control and inspection of farmers' use of pesticides, thus continuing to cause incidents of human and animal poisoning and misuse. To this end, the circular requires the agricultural departments of each province: 1. Should organize a certain number of cadres, in conjunction with local cooperatives, etc., to conduct in-depth inspections of the use, storage, and storage of pesticides in 1952, and summarize the incidents of accidental injury and misuse that have occurred, find out the causes of the incidents, and give appropriate punishment to the perpetrators to improve the responsibility of cadres. Provinces with more incidents, such as Henan, Shaanxi, Hebei, and Shanxi, should quickly make special summaries and formulate specific prevention methods. 2. The scope of use of highly toxic pesticides should be specified. For example, "1065" is currently only allowed to be used by state-owned farms, collective farms, agricultural production cooperatives, and mutual aid teams, and is not allowed to be sold to farmers who have not yet been organized to prevent drug damage. 3. Propaganda and education should continue to be carried out to explain the performance, use, and transportation, use (especially the mixing ratio), and storage methods of various current pesticides to the masses of farmers. Drug-filled utensils and seeds mixed with drugs that have not been used up must be properly disposed of. 4. The currently accumulated pesticides should be properly stored in a suitable location and designated personnel should be responsible for them. Various pesticide instructions and drug-filled equipment should be issued to the buyers along with the drugs. 5. In conjunction with relevant departments, do a good job in pesticide technical guidance through disease and pest control stations and technical guidance stations, and lay the foundation for the large-scale use of pesticides in the future.

    中央农业部再度发出通报
    使用农药时严防误伤误用
    中央人民政府农业部最近发出通报，再次要求各地在使用农药时严防误伤、误用事件发生。关于这一问题，中央人民政府农业部过去已多次指示必须各级领导干部重视，严格控制，集中使用，并要求各地建立严格的检查制度，订出具体的使用、保管办法，尽量组织农民群众集体购买，普遍传授使用、保管技术，并严肃处理中毒事件等。但是，迄今仍有少数地区领导干部存在着官僚主义作风，对农民使用农药没有实行严格的控制和检查，因而继续发生人畜中毒和误作别用的事件。为此，通报要求各省农业部门：一、应组织一定数量的干部，结合当地合作社等，深入检查一九五二年农药的使用、保管、储存情况，并把所发生的误伤、误用事件加以总结，找出事件发生的原因，对肇事人员分别给予适当处分，以提高干部的责任心。发生事件较多的河南、陕西、河北、山西等省，应迅速作出专题总结和订出具体的防止办法。二、有剧毒的农药应规定使用范围，如“一○六五”目前只准国营农场、集体农庄和农业生产合作社、互助组使用，不准卖给尚未组织起来的农民，以防药害。三、应继续进行宣传教育，把各种现用农药的性能、用途和运输、使用（特别是配合量）、保管的方法等，在农民群众中一一交代清楚。装药用具和拌过药而未用完的种子，必须妥善处理。四、目前积存的农药应选择适当地点妥为保管，并指定专人负责。各种农药说明书和装药器具，应随药发给买药人。五、应结合有关部门，通过病虫防治站、技术指导站，作好农药技术指导工作，打下今后大量使用农药的基础。（新华社）
