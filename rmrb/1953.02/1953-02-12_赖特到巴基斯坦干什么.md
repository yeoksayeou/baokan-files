What is Wright Doing in Pakistan?
	Jia Ling

The recent visit to Pakistan by U.S. Eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean Naval Commander Wright reveals that the United States is increasing pressure on countries facing the Indian Ocean, attempting to obtain military bases, and intensifying its efforts to push out Britain's traditional military dominance in the region. On January 27, Wright, during a press conference on his flagship, the USS Pittsburgh, outside the port of Karachi, undisguisedly stated that his military command would extend all the way to the Bay of Bengal. According to his schedule, he would also visit Madras and Ceylon and hold talks with political and military leaders in these areas to "obtain cooperation" in the event of so-called emergencies. He said that this would complete the task assigned to him by the U.S. government.

Wright first brought his flagship, the USS Pittsburgh, to Pakistan and boldly stated, "A look at the map shows the strategic importance of Pakistan!"

The United States is eager to find a foothold that can stand firm between the Middle East and Southeast Asia to properly connect the United States' forces invading the Middle East with the United States' forces invading Southeast Asia. Pakistan is seen by the United States as a suitable target that meets these conditions, especially since its territory is made up of two units, which can better exert this effect. As the people of the Middle Eastern countries increasingly defend peace and strive for national independence, the United States' attempt to create a "Middle East Defense Organization" has encountered many difficulties. In order to quickly piece together this aggressive organization to strengthen control over the Middle East, the United States wants to use Turkey in the west, a country already under U.S. control, and Pakistan in the east, a country the United States is intensifying its invasion of, to first prop up the framework of the "Middle East Defense Organization," and then lure Egypt and other countries to participate in the second step. The day after Wright brought his warships to Karachi, The New York Times published an editorial entitled "Pakistan and Defense," which bluntly stated: "Pakistan is indeed a bridge. A strong alliance of Pakistan, Turkey, and Egypt can change the bleak situation of the free world (referring to the imperialist and aggressive camp headed by the United States) in this region into a solid force." Wright, with this goal in mind, conducted a series of political activities other than "visits," so that Karachi reporters could not help but ask the question: As a naval commander, why did Wright run to the Khyber Pass on the Afghan border?

This conspiracy did not start with Wright. As early as the beginning of March 1951, newspapers in Karachi and Delhi revealed the United States' attempt to drag Pakistan into the Middle East aggressive bloc. In March of the same year, George McGhee, then U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern, South Asian, and African Affairs, made a round trip from the Middle East to Pakistan. At that time, the United States expressed interest in using the dispute between Pakistan and India over Kashmir to obtain military bases in northern Pakistan. Soon after, the United States expressed great interest in expanding the ports of Chittagong in East Pakistan and Karachi in West Pakistan. At the same time, under the influence of the United States, the diplomatic relations between Turkey and Pakistan suddenly became active. Turkey sent its Deputy Chief of the General Staff, Zekai Okan, to lead a military delegation to Pakistan for "sightseeing." In 1952, U.S. forces further invaded Pakistan. The infamous "Point Four Program" agreement signed in June of the same year provided a "legal" springboard for U.S. forces to invade Pakistan. Since then, American businessmen bearing the signboard of the "International Bank for Reconstruction and Development" and American "professors" holding the credentials of the "United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization" have continuously appeared in Pakistan. But even more noteworthy were two senior U.S. military officers, one was U.S. Pacific Fleet Commander Admiral Radford, and the other was U.S. Assistant Secretary of Defense (responsible for personnel and personnel work) Mrs. Rosenberg. They visited Pakistan one after another at the end of 1952, and like Wright, held a series of meetings with Pakistani military experts, and also "visited" the Khyber Pass. From these brief backgrounds, the true nature of Wright's "visit" can be seen.

In addition, U.S. imperialism also used the famine in Pakistan to put pressure on Pakistan. According to reports, Pakistan needs to import about 950,000 tons of wheat. The United States seized on this point to coerce it. In December 1952, U.S. Ambassador to Pakistan, Warren, informally expressed his insistence that the Pakistani government revise its attitude on certain matters, especially regarding the "Middle East Command."

When Wright's cruisers were sailing back and forth in front of the doors of countries along the Indian Ocean, British officials stationed in Karachi and New Delhi refused to comment on this matter. Until now, Britain still occupies a traditional superior position in Pakistan. It cannot but use its influence to prevent the invasion of Pakistan by U.S. forces. For example, in April 1951, the United States proposed to Pakistan the signing of a "Treaty of Commerce, Navigation and Friendship" between the United States and Pakistan. The requirements of the United States in this proposal included: 1. The U.S. dollar should receive the most favorable exchange rate against the Pakistani rupee; 2. U.S. imported goods should enjoy preferential tax rates absolutely equal to those of the British Empire; 3. Explicit provisions should be made to protect U.S. investment in Pakistan; 4. The visa system for Americans to Pakistan should be abolished. These demands directly threaten British interests in Pakistan. Therefore, this treaty is still an unsigned draft to this day.

The broad masses of the Pakistani people strongly oppose the aggressive conspiracy of U.S. imperialism. When Wright arrived in Karachi, it aroused the anger and condemnation of the Pakistani people. At a meeting on January 21, the Karachi Peace Committee passed a resolution firmly opposing Pakistan's participation in the Middle East aggressive bloc organized by U.S. imperialism. Many Pakistani parties and social organizations also issued joint statements demanding that the Pakistani government refuse to join this aggressive bloc and not allow those imperialists who have stained their hands with the blood of Muslim people to turn Pakistan into their military base. This public opinion, representing the broad masses of the people, is like a strong fortress lying across the path of U.S. imperialism's invasion of Pakistan, causing the conspiracy of Wright and his ilk to be met with a head-on blow.

    赖特到巴基斯坦干什么
    佳令
    美国东大西洋及地中海海军司令赖特最近访问巴基斯坦，暴露了美国正对面向印度洋的国家开始增加压力，设法取得军事基地，并且加紧排挤英国在这个地区的传统的军事优势地位。一月二十七日，赖特在喀喇蚩港口外他的旗舰“匹兹堡号”上举行记者招待会，毫无掩饰地说：他的军事指挥权将一直扩展到孟加拉湾去。按照他的日程，他还要访问马德拉斯和锡兰，并和这些地区的政治军事领袖会谈，以便在所谓紧急的状态下“取得合作”。他说，这样他才算完成美国政府给他的任务。
    赖特把他的旗舰“匹兹堡号”首先开到巴基斯坦，并且大胆放肆地说：“一看地图就知道巴基斯坦的战略地位重要！”
    美国很想在中东地区和东南亚地区之间找一个能站得稳的据点，以便把美国侵入中东的力量和美国侵入东南亚的力量适当地连结起来。巴基斯坦就是美国认为适合条件的良好目标，特别是因为它的领土由两个单元所构成，更能发挥这种作用。由于中东各国人民保卫和平、争取民族独立的运动日益高涨，美国想搞一个“中东防御组织”的企图遭遇到很多困难。为了快点拼凑成这个侵略组织来加强控制中东地区，美国就想从西边的土耳其这个美国已经控制下的国家，和东边的巴基斯坦这个美国加紧侵入的国家，先把“中东防御组织”的架子支撑起来，第二步再拉拢埃及和其他国家参加。在赖特带了他的军舰到喀喇蚩后的第二天，“纽约时报”发表的以“巴基斯坦和防御”为题的社论，就直截了当地说：“巴基斯坦确确实实是一座桥梁。一个强有力的巴基斯坦和土耳其及埃及的联盟，能够把自由世界（指美国为首的帝国主义侵略阵营）在这个地区的暗淡局面改变成为巩固的力量。”赖特就抱着这样的目的，进行了一系列的“访问”以外的政治活动，以致喀喇蚩的记者们不能不提出这样的问题：作为一个海军指挥官，赖特为甚么要跑到阿富汗边境上的开伯尔隘口去？
    这个阴谋不是从赖特才开始的。远在一九五一年三月初，喀喇蚩和德里的报纸就透露了美国企图把巴基斯坦拉进中东侵略集团。同年三月间，美国当时负责近东、南亚和非洲事务的助理国务卿乔治·麦克希曾从中东到巴基斯坦跑了一个圈子。那时候，美国表示了对于利用巴基斯坦和印度关于克什米尔问题的纠纷，在巴基斯坦北部取得军事基地的兴趣。不久以后，美国又表示对东巴基斯坦的吉大港和西巴基斯坦喀喇蚩的港口扩大工作极有兴趣。同时在美国的牵引下，土耳其和巴基斯坦的外交关系也突然活跃起来。土耳其曾派它的副总参谋长宰克·欧汗领着军事代表团到巴基斯坦“观光”。一九五二年，美国势力进一步侵入巴基斯坦。同年六月间签订的臭名远扬的杜鲁门“第四点计划”的协定，给美国势力侵入巴基斯坦修了一条“合法”的跳板。那时以后，挂着“国际复兴开发银行的招牌的美国商人和拿着联合国教育、科学、文化组织”聘书的美国“教授”不断在巴基斯坦出现。但是更值得注意的，还有两个美国高级军官，一个是美国太平洋舰队司令雷德福海军上将，另外一个是美国助理国防部长（负责兵员和人事工作的）罗森堡夫人。他们在一九五二年年底先后访问了巴基斯坦，也和赖特一样，和巴基斯坦的军事专家举行了一连串的会议，也都去“访问”了开伯尔隘口。从这些简略的背景就可以看出赖特“访问”的真正性质了。
    此外，美帝国主义还利用巴基斯坦粮荒对巴基斯坦施用压力。据公布，巴基斯坦需要输入约九十五万吨小麦。美国便抓住这点进行要挟。一九五二年十二月美国驻巴基斯坦大使华伦曾经非正式地表示坚持要巴基斯坦政府在某些事务上修改它的态度，特别是有关“中东司令部”的问题。
    当赖特的巡洋舰在印度洋沿岸国家大门前开来开去的时候，驻在喀喇蚩和新德里的英国官员对这件事都拒绝评论。直到现在，英国在巴基斯坦仍然占有传统的优越地位。它对美国势力侵入巴基斯坦就不能不运用它的影响予以阻止。例如，一九五一年四月间美国向巴基斯坦提议签订美国和巴基斯坦的“通商航海友好条约”。美国在这个建议中的要求包括：一、美元对巴基斯坦卢比应得到最优惠的兑换率；二、美国入口货物应享受和大英帝国绝对平等的优惠税率；三、明文规定保护美国在巴基斯坦的投资；四、取消美国人到巴基斯坦的签证制度。这些要求直接威胁着英国在巴基斯坦的利益。因此，这个条约一直到现在还是一张无法签字的草案。
    巴基斯坦广大阶层人民强烈反对美帝国主义的侵略阴谋。当赖特一到喀喇蚩，就引起巴基斯坦人民的愤怒和斥责。喀喇蚩和平委员会在一月二十一日的会议上通过决议，坚决反对巴基斯坦参加美帝国主义筹组的中东侵略集团。巴基斯坦许多党派和社会团体也发表联合声明，要求巴基斯坦政府拒绝加入这个侵略集团，不准那些手上染满了回教人民鲜血的帝国主义者把巴基斯坦变为他们的军事基地。这些代表广大人民的舆论就像一座坚强的堡垒横放在美帝国主义侵入巴基斯坦的道路上，使赖特之流的阴谋碰到迎面的打击。
