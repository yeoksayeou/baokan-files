    Northeast Design Units of the Ministry of Heavy Industry Examine Work and Criticize Erroneous Designs

    [This newspaper dispatch] The design units of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry system in the Northeast are now examining their design work, exposing erroneous designs, and criticizing the conservative and backward thinking of design personnel in order to improve the quality of design work. After the design companies of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry in Shenyang generally examined the shortcomings in their design work, they have begun to criticize typical erroneous designs. The design departments of the Northeast Nonferrous Metals Bureau, the Northeast Chemical Industry Bureau, and the Northeast Building Materials Industry Bureau have also examined the shortcomings and errors in their past work.

    The design companies of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry in Shenyang began their inspection work on January 17. They found that the reason why so many errors occurred in past design work was mainly because the design personnel had not yet established correct design thinking. Some design personnel used bourgeois viewpoints to carry out design. Chen Dingxin, deputy engineer of the design company's design section, only pursued formal aesthetics when designing a medium-sized motor factory, without asking about the effect. He designed the glass windows of the medium-sized motor factory in a "streamlined" style, but did not consider the equipment inside the factory. The construction department followed his design and made the windows, only to find that there were large crane beams across the middle of the windows, blocking the light. In the past, Soviet experts had suggested that when designing factory buildings, workers' locker rooms should be designed. Chen Dingxin disagreed with this suggestion, mistakenly thinking: "Workers only have a few tattered clothes, what is the point of designing locker rooms?" When Deputy Engineer Yan Zhongying was designing a medium-sized motor, he was very excited when he heard that the Electric Power Bureau advocated designing it as a steel structure. He felt: "I used to study steel structures, so now I can show off my skills." However, he did not consider that using concrete structures to replace steel structures could save the country a lot of steel. In the inspection work, he confessed: "In the past, my mind was filled with British and American technical standards, and I had no socialist economic accounting viewpoint at all."

    In the process of exposing erroneous designs, the sloppy, careless, and irresponsible work style of design personnel was also revealed. When designing the cotton cleaning workshop of the Jinzhou Textile Factory, the design company, due to the irresponsibility of the design personnel, did not carry out geological surveys and casually assumed a ground bearing capacity figure, and then made the design. Now the walls of the cotton cleaning workshop's factory building and warehouse are cracked, and the machines cannot be installed in the factory building, which affects the start of the cotton cleaning workshop. Deputy Engineer Wang Jiaying went out to collect data, worked for more than 20 days, and proposed some design data. He wrote on the design data: "For reference only." When designing, the design personnel did not dare to use his data and had to go out again to collect data, and found that there were many errors in the data he provided. He measured a cement pillar and measured the width of the pillar 10 centimeters too much. During the inspection work, the design personnel exposed Wang Jiaying's irresponsible work attitude and helped him to recognize the seriousness of his mistakes ideologically.

    The design personnel also revealed the design errors of the No. 11 Machinery Factory. When designing this factory, Assistant Engineer Wu Guangdian did not study the geological data, and regardless of the terrain, he uniformly adopted a ground bearing capacity of 25 tons per square meter. After the design was completed, it was discovered that there was silt and small ditches under the foundation, which could not withstand the pressure of 25 tons per square meter. As a result, they had to rework, wasting manpower and material resources. When designing the roof truss of this factory, he did not consider the structure of the roof truss and casually installed concrete panels. After the roof truss was built, three concrete panels suddenly fell from the roof truss, so that the workers could not work safely in the factory. After inspection, the design personnel realized that they must immediately correct this extremely irresponsible work style.

    In the process of inspecting work and criticizing erroneous ideas, the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry Design Company also inspected the situation of learning from Soviet advanced experience.

    Some design personnel reflected that although they recognized the superiority of Soviet experience and were determined to learn from Soviet experience, they had not yet learned the advanced thinking and practical work style of Soviet experts. Some design personnel used the excuse of tight tasks to not fully modify the design according to the suggestions of Soviet experts, resulting in many errors. In order to further criticize erroneous design ideas, the Heavy Industry Ministry Design Company is now comprehensively criticizing the erroneous designs of the Medium-sized Motor Factory and the No. 11 Machinery Factory, and thoroughly examining the conservative and backward ideas in the design work.

    In the inspection work, the Northeast Nonferrous Metals Bureau focused on criticizing the phenomenon of not paying attention to geological data. In the past, the bureau produced many shortcomings in design work because of a lack of correct geological data. When the bureau was building a technical school, it did not understand the underground situation in detail. After the building was built, many windows had cracks due to unbalanced pressure resistance. When the bureau was measuring the terrain map of an aerial cableway of a lead mine, it did not study it carefully. During construction, it was discovered that there were many errors in the original measured terrain map, and some elevations differed by more than eight meters. When designing a copper mine, it did not seriously collect water source data and casually stipulated the water volume as 9,000 tons, but during construction, it was discovered that the water volume was only 2,000 tons. The Northeast Building Materials Industry Bureau generally inspected the shortcomings of design work by criticizing the design errors of the No. 1 Ceramics Factory. The director and section chiefs of the bureau's design department first examined their bureaucratic style in leadership work, and the design personnel also conducted self-criticism. Recently, they will use the design errors of the No. 8 Cement Factory as an example to criticize the irresponsible work style and conservative and backward thinking of the design personnel. The Northeast Chemical Industry Bureau is also inspecting design work and has initially criticized bourgeois design thinking.

    重工业部东北各设计单位
    检查工作批判错误设计
    【本报讯】中央重工业部系统在东北的各设计单位，现在正检查设计工作，揭发错误设计，批判设计人员的保守落后思想，以便提高设计工作的质量。中央重工业部在沈阳的设计公司普遍检查设计工作中的缺点以后，已开始批判典型的错误设计。东北有色金属管理局，东北化学工业管理局和东北建筑材料工业管理局的设计部门，也检查了过去工作中的缺点和错误。
    中央重工业部在沈阳的设计公司从一月十七日起，进行检查工作，发现过去设计工作中所以发生很多的错误，主要是因为设计人员还没有树立起正确的设计思想。有些设计人员以资产阶级的观点来进行设计。设计公司设计科副工程师陈鼎新设计中型电机厂时，只追求形式上的美观，而不问效果如何。他把中型电机厂的玻璃窗设计成“流线型”的，却没有考虑厂内的设备。施工部门按照他的设计做好窗子，才发现在窗子中间，横着粗大的吊车梁，把光线都挡住了。过去苏联专家曾建议：设计厂房时，应该设计工人们的更衣室。陈鼎新不同意这个建议，错误地认为：“工人只有几件破烂衣裳，要设计更衣室干什么？”严钟英副工程师设计中型电机时，听说电工局主张要设计成钢结构的，他非常兴奋，他觉得：“过去我学的是钢结构，这一下可以显显我的本领了。”但他没有考虑到用混凝土结构来代替钢结构，可以节省国家很多的钢材。在检查工作中，他检讨说：“过去满脑子装的是英美的技术标准，根本没有什么社会主义的经济核算观点。”
    在揭发错误设计的过程中，还暴露了设计人员马虎草率、不负责任的工作作风。设计公司在设计锦州纺织厂清花车间时，由于设计人员不负责任，没有进行地质勘察工作，随便假定了一个地耐力的数字，就做出了设计。现在清花车间的厂房、仓库的墙壁都裂了缝，机器不能安装在厂房内，影响了清花车间的开工。副工程师汪家瑛到外面去搜集资料，工作了二十多天，提出了一些设计资料，他在设计资料上写道：“仅供参考。”设计时，设计人员都不敢用他的资料，只好重新到外面去搜集资料，并发现他提出的资料有很多的错误。他测量一个洋灰柱子，把柱子的宽度多量了十公分。在进行检查工作时，设计人员揭发了汪家瑛不负责的工作态度，并帮助他从思想上认清错误的严重性。
    设计人员还揭露了第十一机械厂设计的错误。在设计这工厂时，助理工程师吴光典没有研究地质资料，不管地形的情况，一律采用每平方公尺二十五吨的地耐力。设计好了之后，才发现基础下面有淤泥、小沟，不能承受每平方公尺二十五吨的压力。结果只好重新返工，浪费了人力、物力。在设计这个工厂的屋架时，他也没有考虑屋架的结构，马马虎虎安上混凝土板。盖好了屋架，三块混凝土板忽然从屋架上落下来，以致工人们不能安心在厂内工作。经过检查，设计人员们都认识到必须立即纠正这种极不负责的工作作风。
    中央重工业部设计公司在检查工作、批判错误思想的过程中，还检查了学习苏联先进经验的情况。
    一些设计人员反映出他们虽然认识了苏联经验的优越性，决心要学习苏联经验，但还没有学习到苏联专家的先进的思想和切实的工作作风。有些设计人员借口任务太紧，没有完全按照苏联专家的建议来修改设计，因而发生了很多错误。为了进一步批判错误的设计思想，重工业部设计公司现正全面地批判中型电机厂和第十一机械厂的错误设计，深入检查设计工作中的保守落后思想。
    东北有色金属管理局在检查工作中，着重地批评了不重视地质资料的现象。该局过去在设计工作中，因为缺乏正确的地质资料，产生了很多缺点。该局修建技术学校时，没有详细了解地下情况。盖好房子后，因为耐压力不平衡，许多窗户已发生裂缝。该局在测量一个铅矿的架空索道的地形图时，没有仔细研究，在施工中才发现原测量的地形图有很多差错，有的标高竟相差八公尺多。设计一个铜矿时，没有认真搜集水源资料，随便地规定水量为九千吨，但在施工时，才发现水量只有两千吨。东北建筑材料工业管理局通过批判第一陶瓷厂设计的错误，普遍检查设计工作的缺点。该局设计处处长、科长首先检讨了在领导工作中的官僚主义作风，设计人员也进行了自我批评。最近他们将以第八水泥厂设计的错误为例，来批判设计人员的不负责任的工作作风和保守落后思想。东北化学工业管理局也在检查设计工作中，初步批判了资产阶级的设计思想。
