The Huainan Mining Bureau Accepts Newspaper Criticism and Actively Strengthens Basic Construction Preparations

    This newspaper criticized the slow progress of basic construction preparations at the Fengfeng and Huainan Mining Bureaus on December 24th of last year. After seeing the criticism in the newspaper, the leading cadres of the Huainan Mining Bureau humbly reviewed their work and convened an enlarged meeting of cadres from various mines, clearly proposing that basic construction be the primary task in the future and making specific arrangements. Subsequently, the entire mine spent ten days, combined with a review of past basic construction work, conducting a mass study of basic construction policies. At present, the organizational structure for basic construction in the mine has been basically established. In addition to the original 314 cadres in the basic construction department, nearly 200 cadres have been newly transferred from production departments. In order to strengthen drilling and civil engineering work, the captains of the three engineering brigades are all cadres at the county level. The strength of the design department has also been strengthened. More than 1,400 workers have been fixed and have been undergoing centralized training since mid-December of last year. One hundred mechanical and electrical workers have been recruited from Shanghai and have already begun training. Material supply work is being prepared in accordance with the engineering plan.

    淮南矿务局接受本报批评
    积极加强基本建设准备工作
    本报于去年十二月二十四日，曾对峰峰、淮南两矿务局基本建设准备工作迟缓的现象进行了批评。淮南矿务局领导干部看到报上的批评以后，虚心地检查了自己的工作，并召开了各矿场干部扩大会议，明确提出了今后以基本建设为首要任务的方针，作了具体部署。接着，全矿以十天时间，结合检查过去的基本建设工作，开展了一次群众性的对基本建设政策的学习。目前该矿基本建设的组织机构基本上已健全起来，除原有基本建设部门的干部三百一十四人外，又新从生产部门抽调了近二百名干部。为了加强钻探、土木建筑工作，三个工程大队的大队长均由县级干部充任。设计处的力量也加强了。工人已固定了一千四百余名，从去年十二月中旬开始集中训练。机电工人从上海招来一百名，并已开始训练。器材供应工作正按照工程计划进行准备。
