Chang Guanghua, Deputy Director of the Hefei Public Security Bureau in Anhui Province, abused his power. In October of last year, he connived with subordinate public security personnel to illegally arrest leading cadres and actors of the publicly owned Experimental Theater, seriously violating human rights and violating laws and discipline. This incident has not been dealt with seriously. In January of this year, when the East China Cultural Department sent personnel to investigate, Chang Guanghua still showed no awareness of his illegal and undisciplined behavior. On January 23rd, the Hefei Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party made a decision to expel Chang Guanghua from the Party. At the same time, the Hefei Municipal People's Government also decided to remove him from his post as Deputy Director of the Public Security Bureau. The facts are as follows:

During the period when the Hefei Municipal Public Experimental Theater was privately operated, local public security personnel could not only enter the theater without buying tickets, but the theater staff also had to offer them cigarettes and tea. After it was converted to public ownership in 1951, the theater gradually corrected these past malpractices. However, some public security personnel were very dissatisfied with this improvement. During routine household registration checks, or on the street, they sometimes acted frivolously towards the female actors of the theater.

On August 24, 1952, Xue Zhendong, a detective from the Hefei Public Security Bureau, went to the Experimental Theater to buy a ticket. Because the audience was crowded, he could not buy one and was greatly dissatisfied. He entered the theater and quarreled with the theater staff, rummaged through files in the office, and even slammed the table and cursed: "A small theater dares to cross the Public Security Bureau. They're blind. Just wait and see!" At 8 p.m. the next evening, Xue Zhendong and Chen Qicai (who claimed to be a staff member of the Municipal Public Security Bureau) brought more than ten public security personnel. After drinking at the Jinling Snack Bar, they broke into the theater, falsely claiming that Wang Xiangzhen (the theater's political instructor, a Communist Party member) had promised to reserve ten seats for them. When the ticket inspector tried to stop them, they barged into the theater, shouting arbitrarily, standing and sitting randomly, disrupting the theater's order. Unsuccessful in persuading them to stop, the theater director, Huang Ning, called Chang Guanghua, the Deputy Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau. Chang said on the phone: "... Your small theater has problems. The staff looks down on the Public Security Bureau, and they need to be educated. These people in our bureau are also cheap. They don't want to watch big plays, they want to watch small plays... I'll call them back." When Xue Zhendong and others were called back by the Municipal Public Security Bureau, they threatened the theater staff saying: "You dare to make us lose face, just wait and see." The theater director reported the situation to Yang Jie, Deputy Director of the Provincial Cultural Bureau, and asked him to relay it to Su Yiran, Director of the Provincial Public Security Department (a member of the Provincial Party Committee), and Ding Jizhe, Mayor of Hefei. Mayor Ding Jizhe ordered Chang Guanghua, Deputy Director of the Public Security Bureau, to conduct an investigation. However, Chang not only failed to stop and deal with this violation of law and discipline by his subordinates, but instead blamed the Experimental Theater for looking down on the Public Security Bureau.

On the night of October 28th, Section Chief Sun of the West City Branch of the Hefei Public Security Bureau, together with police officers from the Hepingqiao Police Station, went to the dormitory of the Experimental Theater to check household registrations. Their words and attitude were very frivolous and rude, shouting everywhere: "Where do Bao Zhiyuan and Lang Min (both female actors) live?" At the same time, they used electric batons to shine on the faces of the female actors, causing dissatisfaction among the actors. When one of the actors raised an objection to them, Section Chief Sun shouted: "Arrest them! If they have any objections, let them raise them at the bureau." As a result, six people were found not to have registered their households (they had just been transferred from the art troupe, and the police station had told them to postpone household registration). They were about to be taken away. Wang Xiangzhen proposed: "They have work tomorrow. If you want to take people, I'll go with you." Section Chief Sun immediately took Wang Xiangzhen away with them and detained him at the Hepingqiao Police Station. Except for Wang Xiangzhen, who was taken away by the Municipal Public Security Bureau for interrogation the next morning, the other six people were detained until 8 a.m. the next morning before being released by the police station.

When Wang Xiangzhen was brought to the Municipal Public Security Bureau on the morning of the 29th, Chang Guanghua immediately questioned him loudly as soon as he entered the door: "Are you from that small theater? Why didn't you register your households?" When Wang explained the reasons why some cadres of the theater had not registered their households, Chang rebuked him for sophistry and cursed loudly:

"Your small theater relies on big organizations and looks down on our Public Security Bureau! This is my jurisdiction. I will immediately revoke your license and shut down your theater!" Wang immediately replied: "The theater is the people's theater. If you close it down, it will also be a loss to the country!" At this time, Chang Guanghua burst into profanity: "Damn it, handcuff him and send him to jail!" He also said: "I'm willing to resign as Deputy Director to lock you up!" Afterwards, Huang Jianzhong, Deputy Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee, and Ding Jizhe, Mayor, went to the Public Security Bureau to investigate after hearing the news, pointed out that this was a wrong act, and ordered his release. However, Chang emphasized the public security regulations and refused to comply. It was not until Su Yiran, Director of the Provincial Public Security Department, called that Wang was released. Wang was detained in the Municipal Public Security Bureau for a total of eleven hours.

After this incident occurred, Gui Linqi, Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and Su Yiran, Director of the Provincial Public Security Department, although they pointed out Chang's mistakes and ordered him to make a self-criticism, lacked sufficient understanding of the seriousness of this violation of law and discipline, and therefore did not deal with it seriously.

It was not until January 11th of this year that the East China Cultural Department sent personnel to Hefei to investigate after receiving a report, and after Yang Jie, Deputy Director of the Provincial Cultural Bureau, urged prompt handling, the provincial authorities convened a symposium of all relevant parties on January 14th. At the meeting, Chang Guanghua only admitted that he was impulsive and did not make a deep self-criticism at all. Su Yiran, Director of the Provincial Public Security Department, said that: (1) Some personnel in the public security system have incorrect views on opera performers; (2) Detaining theater staff was wrong, and Chang Guanghua should be responsible; (3) The theater's failure to register households showed a lack of attention to government laws and regulations, which was also wrong; (4) Chang Guanghua should hold a general meeting in the Public Security Bureau to make a self-criticism; the theater should also hold a meeting to make a self-criticism, and the two sides should closely cooperate in the future to resolve their differences. Finally, Gui Linqi, Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Provincial Party Committee, made a summary, expressing agreement with Su Yiran's opinion, believing that "Comrade Chang Guanghua listened to the one-sided words of a few people, acted rashly without consideration, and should bear the main responsibility and make a self-criticism. The theater is publicly owned, and the security work should be valued. The responsible comrades of the theater should closely contact the Public Security Bureau and provide them with convenience in their work. In the future, both sides should improve their relationship." The way this matter was handled is unsatisfactory. First of all, the "speech" and "summary" of Su Yiran, a member of the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Director of the Provincial Public Security Department, and Gui Linqi, Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, were undiscriminating and lacked the necessary principles; at the same time, the Party and government leading organs of Anhui Province and Hefei City did not make a serious and timely handling of the illegal and criminal acts of Chang Guanghua, Deputy Director of the Hefei Public Security Bureau, and others in violating laws and discipline and infringing on human rights. The Hefei Municipal People's Government's punishment of Chang Guanghua was merely dismissal. It was not until more than ten days after the Hefei Municipal People's Government made its decision that the Anhui Provincial People's Government ordered the judicial organs to arrest Chang Guanghua and punish him according to law.

    合肥市公安局副局长常光华违法乱纪
    纵容公安人员非法拘捕演员被撤职法办
    安徽省合肥市人民政府公安局副局长常光华滥用职权，在去年十月间，纵容所属公安人员非法拘捕公营实验剧场的领导干部和演员，严重地侵犯人权，违法乱纪。这个事件，一直没有得到严肃的处理。本年一月，华东文化部派员去调查的时候，常光华对于自己的违法乱纪行为，还丝毫没有认识。中国共产党合肥市委在一月二十三日作出了决定，开除常光华的党籍，同时合肥市人民政府也决定撤销他的公安局副局长的职务。事实经过是这样的：
    合肥市公营实验剧场在私营期间，当地公安人员去看戏非但可以不买戏票，剧场人员还要敬烟敬茶。一九五一年改为公营以后，剧场对过去陋规，逐步加以纠正。可是部分公安人员，对这种改进却非常不满。在日常查户口中，或在街上，对剧场的女演员时有轻佻行动。
    一九五二年八月二十四日，合肥市公安局侦察队员薛振东去实验剧场买戏票，因观众拥挤不曾买到，大为不满，就进入剧场和剧场工作人员发生争吵，并到办公室乱翻文件，甚至拍桌大骂：“小戏院跟我们公安局闹蹩扭，真是瞎了眼，以后瞧吧！”次日晚八时，薛振东、陈七才（自称是市公安局科员）带了十多个公安人员，在金陵小吃馆吃酒以后，闯入剧场，冒言王祥珍（剧场的政治指导员，共产党员）曾经答应留十只座位给他们，检查员制止不住，他们便闯进场子，任意叫喊，乱站乱坐，破坏剧场秩序，解劝无效。剧场主任黄宁就打电话给市公安局副局长常光华，常在电话中说：“……你们小戏院有问题，工作人员看不起公安局，要好好教育。我们局里这些人也下贱，放着大戏不看，要看小戏……我把他们叫回来好了。”薛振东等被市公安局派人叫回去的时候还用威胁的口吻对剧场工作人员说：“你们敢给我们下不去，等着看吧。”剧场主任当把这情况报告省文化局杨杰副局长，并请转告省公安厅苏毅然厅长（中共省委委员）和合肥市丁继哲市长，由丁继哲市长责令公安局副局长常光华进行检查，但常对所属人员这种违犯法纪的行为，不仅不加以制止和处理，反责怪实验剧场看不起公安局。
    十月二十八日夜，合肥市公安局西市分局孙股长会同和平桥派出所员警去实验剧场宿舍清查户口的时候，言语和态度非常轻佻恶劣，到处乱喊：“鲍志远、郎敏（均女演员）住哪里？”同时用电棒向女演员脸上乱照，引起演员不满。当时有个演员向他们提出意见，孙股长即嚷着说：“把他们逮起来，让他们有意见到局子里去提。”结果查出六个人没有报户口（刚由文工团调来，派出所曾叫他们暂缓办户口登记）便要带走。王祥珍提出：“他们明天还有工作，要带人，我跟你们去好了。”孙股长当即将王祥珍一起带走，送到和平桥派出所拘押。其中除王祥珍于天明时由市公安局提去审讯外，其余六人一直押到第二天上午八时才由派出所释放。
    王祥珍于二十九日晨被提到市公安局时，一进门，常光华即向他大声质问：“你是小戏院子里的吗？你们为什么不报户口？”王就把剧场某些干部未报户口的原因，加以说明，常斥为狡辩，大骂道：
    “你小戏院依仗大机关，瞧不起我们公安局！这是我管的地方，马上撤销你的执照，封闭你的戏院！”王当即答称：“剧场是人民的剧场，你封了它，也是国家的损失！”这时常光华竟破口大骂起来：“妈的，把他铐起来，送到牢里去！”并说：“我拼了副局长不干，也要把你关起来！”事后，市委副书记黄建中、市长丁继哲闻讯至公安局检查，指出这是错误行为，并令其释放，但常强调治安条例，拒不执行。直至省公安厅苏厅长去了电话，才将王释放。王被关押在市公安局共达十一小时。
    这一事件发生后，中共安徽省委宣传部部长桂林栖和省公安厅长苏毅然虽然指出了常的错误，并责令检讨，但对这件违法乱纪事件的严重性，缺乏足够的认识，因此一直没有加以严肃的处理。
    直到今年一月十一日华东文化部据报后派员前往合肥调查，并经省文化局副局长杨杰催请迅予处理，省当局才在一月十四日召集各有关方面举行了座谈会。在会上，常光华只承认自己是冲动，根本未作深刻检讨。省公安厅厅长苏毅然发言，认为：（一）公安系统的部分人员对戏曲艺人看法不正确；（二）拘押剧场工作人员是错误的，应由常光华负责；（三）剧场不报户口，对政府法令不重视，也是不对的；（四）常光华应在公安局召开大会作检讨；剧场也要开会检讨，以后双方要密切配合，化除成见。最后由省委宣传部部长桂林栖做总结，表示同意苏毅然的意见，认为“常光华同志听信少数人的一面之词，不加考虑，贸然行事，应负主要责任，要检讨。剧场是公营的，保卫工作应重视，剧场负责同志应与公安局密切联系，给他们工作上的便利。以后双方要搞好关系。”这件事情处理的经过情形是不能令人满意的。首先，中共安徽省委委员、省公安厅厅长苏毅然和中共安徽省委宣传部部长桂林栖，在座谈会上的“发言”和“总结”，是是非不分，缺乏应有的原则性的；同时安徽省和合肥市党政领导机关对合肥市公安局副局长常光华等违法乱纪、侵犯人权的非法恶行亦未及时作认真严肃的处理。合肥市人民政府对常光华的处分仅仅是撤职了事。安徽省人民政府在合肥市人民政府作出决定的十多天之后，才责令司法机关将常光华拘捕依法惩办。
