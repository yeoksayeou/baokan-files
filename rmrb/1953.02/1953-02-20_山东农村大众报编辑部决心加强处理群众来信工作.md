    Shandong Rural Dazhong Daily Editorial Department Resolves to Strengthen Handling of Mass Letters

    Letter from the Shandong Rural Dazhong Daily Editorial Department: We sincerely accept the criticism in the People's Daily "Readers' Letters" section on January 21st and are determined to further improve our work in handling people's letters.

    Our handling of the letters from readers Zhang Huaidao and Zhang Guanwu had shortcomings. We lacked a positive revolutionary attitude towards protecting the masses who exposed bad people and bad deeds, and we also lacked a spirit of responsibility to see this case through to the end. We published Zhang Huaidao's letter exposing the bad behavior of village chief Zhang Erzhu and others, and put forward correct opinions; however, we later rashly published a reply from the Pingyin County People's Court that was neither deeply critical nor distorted the facts. After receiving Comrade Zhang Guanwu's letter stating that he was being attacked by district and township cadres for writing the letter on behalf of Zhang Huaidao, we felt that two points in the letter were not clear enough, so we did not seriously study it and easily forwarded the letter to the Pingyin County Committee of the Communist Party of China for investigation and handling. The main reason for the above serious shortcomings is that the leading cadres of the editorial department have a weak mass viewpoint and lack serious inspection of the handling of people's letters. This bureaucratic style should be eliminated immediately.

    Now, in addition to sending cadres to Pingyin County to cooperate with the local leading organs to seriously handle this case and apologize to Zhang Huaidao and Zhang Guanwu, we have decided to take the following measures to do a good job in handling people's letters: First, the editor-in-chief and the director of the office must read important letters and assist the "Letters Group" in handling them seriously. Second, a people's letters investigation team will be established to be responsible for investigating important letters, changing the current situation of excessive forwarding of letters. Third, organize editorial staff to study relevant instruction documents on handling people's letters and receiving people's visits, and on this basis, further examine and improve our handling of people's letters.

### 山东农村大众报编辑部决心加强处理群众来信工作

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    山东农村大众报编辑部决心加强处理群众来信工作
    山东农村大众报编辑部来信：我们诚恳接受一月二十一日人民日报“读者来信专页”的批评，决心进一步作好处理人民来信的工作。
    我们对读者张怀道、张冠五来信的处理是有缺点的。我们对揭发坏人坏事的群众缺乏积极保护的革命态度，对这一案件的处理也缺乏负责到底的精神。我们发表了张怀道揭发村长张尔朱等恶劣行为的来信，并提出了正确的意见；但后来却又轻率地发表了平阴县人民法院检讨极不深刻而又歪曲事实的答复。我们接到张冠五同志因给张怀道代笔写信而遭到区乡干部打击的来信后，感到来信中有两点交代得不够清楚，就没有认真研究，轻易地将这封信转交中共平阴县委调查处理了。产生以上严重缺点的主要原因，是编辑部领导干部群众观念薄弱，对处理人民来信缺乏认真检查。这种官僚主义作风是应当立即清除的。
    现在，我们除已派干部到平阴县协同当地领导机关认真处理这一案件及向张怀道、张冠五二人作检讨外，并决定采取以下措施作好处理人民来信工作：一、总编辑与办公室主任要阅读重要来信，并协助“来信组”作认真的处理。二、增设人民来信调查小组，对重要来信负责进行调查，改变目前转出信件过多的情况。三、组织编辑部人员学习有关处理人民来信、接见人民来访的指示文件，并在这一基础上进一步检查和改进我们对人民来信的处理工作。
