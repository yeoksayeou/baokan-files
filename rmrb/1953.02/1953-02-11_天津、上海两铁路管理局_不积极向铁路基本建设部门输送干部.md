    Tianjin and Shanghai Railway Administrations
    Do Not Actively Transfer Cadres to Railway Basic Construction Departments

    Driven by their own departmental interests, the Tianjin and Shanghai Railway Administrations have failed to actively transfer cadres to basic construction departments, or have transferred cadres of poor quality to basic construction departments, which has affected the strengthening of railway basic construction forces.

    Since the Government Administration Council's Financial and Economic Committee put forward the policy of giving priority to basic construction last October, the Tianjin and Shanghai Railway Administrations have not earnestly conveyed and discussed this policy among their employees, and have not effectively mobilized employees to participate in basic construction work. Liu Guoliang, the acting director of the Tianjin Railway Administration, repeatedly emphasized that the transportation task was heavy and that many cadres could not be transferred when the Ministry of Railways drew cadres from the administration. He said, "What if the task cannot be completed if the excellent cadres are drawn away?" Under his leadership, the work of drawing cadres from the Tianjin Railway Administration was done very poorly. The Ministry of Railways ordered the Tianjin Railway Administration to draw cadres in September last year to form the 12th Survey and Design Team, but the Tianjin Railway Administration repeatedly delayed and failed to equip the personnel within the time specified by the Ministry of Railways. Later, among the personnel they transferred, 24.8 percent had participated in reactionary parties, groups, and Daomen, including two who were under surveillance. The former Taiyuan Branch of the administration, following the instructions of the Central Government, transferred two excellent Party member technicians to the 12th Survey and Design Team. When these two Party member technicians arrived at the Tianjin Railway Administration, the Engineering Department of the administration actually kept them and replaced them with two lower-quality technicians more than two months later. When the Ministry of Railways criticized the administration for not actively drawing cadres, the administration did not recognize the seriousness of these shortcomings and did not conduct a profound self-criticism.

    The Shanghai Railway Administration also delayed in drawing cadres. The Ministry of Railways ordered the administration in November last year to draw cadres before December 10 to form the 14th Survey and Design Team, but the administration has not yet formed it to this day. The administration even adopted the bad methods of "substitution" and "arbitrarily raising job titles" to cope with the task when drawing cadres. Lu Tongfu, an accountant recently transferred to the Ministry of Railways by the administration, only joined the railway work on August 2 last year. At that time, Lu Tongfu was a financial trainee. However, on November 16 last year, the administration promoted Lu Tongfu to accounting clerk, and two days later, promoted him to accountant, and then transferred him to the Ministry of Railways as an accountant drawn by the administration. Hu Yu'an was originally a technician. In order to cope with the order of the higher authorities to draw engineers, the administration promoted Hu Yu'an to engineer within a few days and sent him to the Ministry of Railways. There are also many examples of the administration using the "substitution" method to cope with the higher authorities. The administration used Li Wenjin, a fourth-class technician, to substitute for the position of telecommunications signal engineer drawn by the higher authorities; Zhang Longshan, a second-class apprentice technician, to substitute for the position of construction engineer drawn by the higher authorities; and Qiu Chengquan, a fifth-class technician, to substitute for the position of water supply engineer. The administration also transferred old, weak, and sick cadres to basic construction departments. This seriously affected the quality of the personnel of the survey and design team and hindered the survey and design work. Xu Shiwei, an engineer transferred to the basic construction department by the administration, is already sixty years old and has lost all his teeth. Xu Shiwei felt it was difficult to participate in the work of building railways. He said, "I am already sixty years old and will retire anyway. I can do whatever work the organization assigns." Until now, his work has not been determined. The Shanghai Railway Administration did not politically mobilize employees to participate in basic construction work, but sent cadres away by improper methods. The director of the Telecommunications Department of the administration said to a cadre:
    "Go! When you get to Beijing, you can work in the Design Bureau of the Central Ministry of Railways. That's great!" When this cadre arrived in Beijing and was assigned to work on-site, he said: "Our leaders said to work in the Design Bureau, why are we sent to the site? Is the organization deceiving people?" His work mood was very uneasy.

### 天津、上海两铁路管理局  不积极向铁路基本建设部门输送干部

    天津、上海两铁路管理局
    不积极向铁路基本建设部门输送干部
    天津、上海铁路管理局从本位利益出发，不积极向基本建设部门输送干部，或把质量低的干部调给基本建设部门，影响了铁路基本建设力量的增强。
    从去年十月政务院财政经济委员会提出把基本建设放在首要地位的方针后，天津、上海铁路管理局没有在职工中认真地传达和讨论这个方针，没有很好地动员职工参加基本建设工作。天津铁路管理局代理局长刘国梁在铁道部向该局抽调干部时，一再强调运输任务重，不能调出很多干部。他说：“把优秀的干部抽走了，完不成任务怎么办呢？”在他的领导下，天津铁路管理局抽调干部的工作是做的很坏的。铁道部在去年九月就命令天津铁路管理局抽调干部，组成第十二勘测设计总队，但天津铁路管理局一再拖延，没有按照铁道部所规定的时间把人员配齐。以后他们抽调出的人员，有百分之二十四点八参加过反动党、团和道门，其中还有两名受管制的分子。该局所属的原太原分局曾按照中央的指示，把两名优秀的党员技术干部输送给第十二勘测设计总队。当这两位党员技术干部到天津铁路管理局时，该局工务处竟把他们留下来，隔了两个多月后，以两个质量较低的技术人员来顶替。当铁道部批评该局不积极抽调干部时，该局还没有认清这些缺点的严重性，没有做深刻的检讨。
    上海铁路管理局在抽调干部时，也拖延时间。去年十一月铁道部命令该局在十二月十日以前抽出干部，组成第十四勘测设计总队，但该局一直到今天还没有组成。该局在抽调干部时，竟然采用“顶替”“任意提高职名”的恶劣方法来应付差事。该局最近调给铁道部的会计员陆同福，是在去年八月二日才参加铁路工作的。当时陆同福是财务练习生。但在去年十一月十六日该局就把陆同福提升为核算员，隔了两天，又提升为会计员，随即调给铁道部，作为该局抽出的一名会计员。胡玉庵原为技术员，该局为了应付上级抽调工程师的命令，在几天之内，就把胡玉庵提升为工程师，送到铁道部。该局以“顶替”的方法来应付上级的例子也是很多的。该局以四等技术员李文锦顶替上级抽调的电讯信号工程师的职名；以二等学习技术员张龙山顶替上级抽调的建筑工程师的职名；以五等技术员裘成泉顶替给水工程师的职名。该局还把老弱的、有病的干部调给基本建设部门。这样就严重地影响了勘测设计总队的人员的质量，妨碍了勘测和设计工作。该局调给基本建设部门的工程师徐师渭，已有六十岁，牙都脱落了。徐师渭感到参加修建铁路的工作很困难。他说：“我已六十岁了，反正就要退休了，听组织上分配什么工作都可以。”一直到现在，他的工作还没有能够确定。上海铁路管理局没有从政治上来动员职工参加基本建设工作，却以不正当的方法把干部送出去了事。该局电务处处长对一个干部说：
    “你去吧！到了北京，你可以在中央铁道部设计局局内工作，这多好呵！”当这个干部到了北京，被派到现场工作，他说：“我们的领导同志说在设计局局内工作，怎么又派到现场去？难道组织上还骗人吗？”工作情绪很不安。
