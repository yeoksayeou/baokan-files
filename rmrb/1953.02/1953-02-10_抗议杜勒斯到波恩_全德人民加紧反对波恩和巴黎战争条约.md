Xinhua News Agency dispatch: As U.S. Secretary of State Dulles visited Bonn on the 5th, all German people have become more vigilant and intensified their struggle against the ratification of the Bonn and Paris war treaties by the West German Federal Parliament.

    Jendretzky, First Secretary of the Greater Berlin District Party Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and member of the Presidium of the National Committee for the Reconstruction of the German Capital, delivered a speech to workers on the 3rd, exposing that Dulles' purpose in coming to Bonn was to discuss with Adenauer how to expedite the passage of the Bonn and Paris war treaties by the West German Federal Parliament. He pointed out that the German people will prevent them from bringing the crimes committed in Korea to Germany!
    The Central Committee of the German Communist Party issued a call to all West German people on the 4th, demanding that they "greet Dulles with strong protest actions as soon as his foot steps on German soil." The statement pointed out that Dulles was ordered by the Eisenhower war government to force European countries to pass the Bonn and Paris war treaties, which is against the will of the Italian, French, British, and German people. The statement said that the German people will issue a louder call than ever before, demanding the conclusion of a peace treaty, opposing the Bonn and Paris war treaties, and demanding the overthrow of the Adenauer government. Dulles' visit will only further enrage the German people, especially the German working class.
    On the eve of Dulles' arrival in Bonn, the West German people further strengthened their struggle against the Federal Parliament's third reading discussion of the Bonn and Paris treaties. Delegations from various enterprises, organizations, and people's groups continuously went to the Bonn Federal Parliament to request meetings with parliamentarians, demanding that they oppose the ratification of the Bonn and Paris treaties. The Federal Parliament receives countless letters and telegrams opposing the Bonn and Paris treaties every day.
    The West German working class has become more closely united in the struggle against the Bonn and Paris war treaties. Recently, in Schwandorf and Augsburg in West Germany, representatives of Communist, Social Democratic, Christian, and non-partisan workers in many regions and enterprises held meetings together, passing resolutions stating that they would take concerted action to oppose Adenauer's war policy and the Bonn and Paris treaties. 【Xinhua News Agency, 7th】U.S. Secretary of State Dulles and "Mutual Security Agency" Director Stassen arrived in Bonn on the 5th to continue their activities to salvage the "Western European Unity" plan, which is on the verge of collapse.

    After arriving in Bonn, Dulles held talks with West German puppet Prime Minister Adenauer and West German Social Democratic leader Ollenhauer respectively, adopting various threatening and enticing methods to force them to find ways to get the parliament to pass the "European Army" treaty, which has been delayed due to the opposition of the entire German people, in order to quickly rebuild the West German armed forces.
    According to an Agence France-Presse report of Adenauer's remarks on the 6th, Dulles has indicated to him that the U.S. government has decided, in accordance with Eisenhower's recently announced principle of tearing up international agreements signed by the U.S., to deny the German-Polish peaceful border stipulated in the Potsdam Agreement and agree that Germany will occupy the land east of the Oder-Neisse line in the future, in order to satisfy the militarist aspirations of the Bonn ruling group. At the same time, Dulles ordered Adenauer to comply with the wishes of the United States and have the "European Army" treaty passed by the deadline he set of April 1st.
    However, the responses Dulles received proved that his activities in Bonn, like his trips to London and Paris, were not satisfactory. On the same day as Dulles' meeting with Adenauer on the 5th, a United Press dispatch from Bonn stated that Dulles "did not receive definite answers" on the "decisive" issues of when West Germany would ratify the "European Army" treaty and the Bonn treaty, and whether West German troops could be established this year. United Press inferred that all Adenauer could tell Dulles was that "he would try his best within his power" to pass the "European Army" treaty. At the same time, Adenauer indicated in his remarks on the 6th that he also bargained with Dulles, saying, "German rearmament must be supported by massive financial aid from the United States."
    The fact Dulles faces is that, with the movement of the German people against the traitorous Paris and Bonn treaties rising, Adenauer is destined to continue to encounter significant difficulties in passing these two treaties in parliament. Fifteen million West German people have voted against these two war treaties. Under the pressure of the broad masses of the people, the West German Social Democratic Party has clearly stated in its meeting with Dulles that it does not dare to openly support the Bonn and Paris treaties.
    What overshadowed Dulles' "mission" was that during his one-day stay in Bonn, the German people issued angry protests. Everywhere on the streets of Bonn through which Dulles passed were slogans of "Dulles go home!" German patriots distributed leaflets with the words: "Dulles' policy is war!" In the German Democratic Republic, vast numbers of workers, peasants, and intellectuals held rallies everywhere, unanimously protesting Dulles' arrival in Bonn.

### 抗议杜勒斯到波恩  全德人民加紧反对波恩和巴黎战争条约

    抗议杜勒斯到波恩
    全德人民加紧反对波恩和巴黎战争条约
    据新华社讯：由于美国国务卿杜勒斯五日访问波恩，全德人民已更加提高警惕，加紧反对西德联邦议院批准波恩和巴黎战争条约的斗争。
    德国统一社会党大柏林区党组织第一书记、德国首都复兴建设工作全国委员会主席团委员延德里茨基三日向工人发表演说，揭露杜勒斯到波恩来的目的是与阿登纳讨论如何可以使西德联邦议院最快地通过波恩与巴黎战争条约，他指出，德国人民将阻止他们把在朝鲜所犯的罪行带到德国来！
    德国共产党中央委员会在四日向所有西德人民发出了号召，要求他们“在杜勒斯的脚一踏上德国国土时，就用强有力的抗议行动来迎接他”。声明指出：杜勒斯是奉艾森豪威尔战争政府之命，来强迫西欧各国通过波恩和巴黎战争条约的，这是违反意大利、法国、英国和德国人民的意志的。声明说：德国人民将比以往任何时候都更加响亮地发出呼声，要求缔结和约，反对波恩与巴黎战争条约，要求推翻阿登纳政府。杜勒斯的来访只会更加激怒德国人民，特别是德国工人阶级。
    在杜勒斯到达波恩的前夕，西德人民进一步加强了他们反对联邦议院三读讨论波恩与巴黎条约的斗争。各种企业、组织和人民团体的代表团不断到波恩联邦议院请求会见议员们，要求他们反对批准波恩与巴黎条约。联邦议院每天都收到无数反对波恩与巴黎条约的信件与电报。
    西德工人阶级在反对波恩与巴黎战争条约的斗争中已更加紧密地团结起来。最近在西德的施万多夫和奥格斯堡，许多地区和许多企业中的共产党、社会民主党、基督教的及无党派工人代表都曾在一起举行会议，通过了决议，表示将为反对阿登纳战争政策、反对波恩与巴黎条约而采取一致行动。 【新华社七日讯】美国国务卿杜勒斯和“共同安全署”署长史塔生于五日到达波恩，继续其挽救濒于瓦解的“西欧统一”计划的活动。
    杜勒斯抵达波恩以后就和西德傀儡总理阿登纳、西德社会民主党首脑奥伦豪尔分别举行会谈，采取种种威胁利诱手段，要他们设法强使议会通过由于全德人民的反对而迟迟未能批准的“欧洲军”条约，以便迅速重建西德国防军。
    根据法新社报道阿登纳六日发表的谈话，杜勒斯已向他表明：美国政府决定按照艾森豪威尔最近宣布的撕毁美国所签定的国际协定的原则，否认波茨坦协定所规定的德波和平边界，同意将来由德国占有奥德河—尼斯河一线以东的土地，以满足波恩统治集团的军国主义愿望。杜勒斯同时命令阿登纳必须遵照美国的意旨，在他所规定的四月一日的限期以前使“欧洲军”条约获得通过。
    但是，杜勒斯所得到的答复证明他在波恩的活动和他的伦敦、巴黎之行一样并不如意。在五日杜勒斯和阿登纳会谈的当天，合众社从波恩发出的电讯说：在西德何时批准“欧洲军”条约和波恩条约以及西德军队今年能否建立这些“决定性”问题上，杜勒斯都“得不到确切的答复”。合众社推断，阿登纳所能告诉杜勒斯的只不过是“他将在他权力范围内尽量设法”通过“欧洲军”条约。同时，阿登纳在六日谈话中表明，他还向杜勒斯讨价还价地表示：“德国重整军备必须美国在财政上大量援助”。
    杜勒斯所面对的事实是：在德国人民反对巴黎和波恩卖国条约的运动日益高涨的情况下，阿登纳要在议会中通过这两项条约注定要继续遭遇重大的困难。一千五百万西德人民已投票反对这两项战争条约，在广大人民压力之下，西德社会民主党方面已经在和杜勒斯的会谈中明白表示不敢公开支持波恩和巴黎条约。
    使杜勒斯的“使命”黯然失色的是：他在波恩仅仅一天的停留中，德国人民发出了愤怒的抗议的呼声。在杜勒斯经过的波恩街道上，到处都是“杜勒斯滚回去！”的标语，德国爱国者散发传单，上面写着：“杜勒斯的政策就是战争！”在德意志民主共和国，广大的工人、农民和知识分子到处举行集会，同声抗议杜勒斯的到达波恩。
