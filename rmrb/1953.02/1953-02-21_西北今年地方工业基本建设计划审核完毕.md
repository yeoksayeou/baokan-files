Xinhua News Agency: The Northwest Administrative Committee's Financial and Economic Committee has completed the audit of the 1953 industrial basic construction plans for the Northwest provinces and cities. In reviewing these plans, the Northwest Administrative Committee's Financial and Economic Committee strictly followed the central government's instructions, controlled investment figures, and criticized the blind thinking of some provinces and cities in industrial construction. It made necessary additions and deletions to impractical projects in the original plan based on actual needs.

　　The Northwest provinces and cities had already prepared their 1953 industrial basic construction plans by the end of last year. However, at that time, due to the lack of clear understanding of the development direction of local industries and the lack of an overall perspective among the plan compilers, the prepared plans were highly blind and exhibited a serious "setting up stalls" phenomenon. For example, when Gansu Province began compiling its plan, it proposed opening unnecessary soy sauce factories, sugar factories, etc. The Lanzhou Paper Mill, which the province planned to open, had been in preparation since 1950 but had never been approved for construction due to unfavorable conditions. After investigation, it is now known that the local raw materials for papermaking are insufficient, it is impossible to transfer pulp from other regions, and there is no market for the products, so opening it would definitely fail. However, the responsible cadres of the Provincial Department of Industry complained to their superiors, saying, "If construction had been approved in 1952, we would have earned at least 10 billion yuan." In the industrial basic construction plan compiled by Shaanxi Province, scattered basic construction projects were budgeted to cost 6 billion yuan, but little investment was made in building materials factories, resource exploration, and cadre training to serve large-scale industrial construction. The Baoji Hongwen Paper Mill had outdated equipment and very poor product quality, with a large backlog of unsold paper, but in the basic construction plan, they still planned to expand the paper mill. The industrial basic construction plan compiled by Xinjiang Province mostly did not consider the relationship between production and sales. The old flour mill in Dihua City was enough to supply the needs of the entire city's residents, but they proposed to build a new flour mill twice the size of the old one in their plan. The production cost of the Dihua Match Factory was very high, and the selling price of the products exceeded the price of matches shipped from Qingdao, but the province still planned to relocate the factory and then expand it.

　　The Northwest Financial and Economic Committee followed these principles in reviewing the industrial basic construction plans of the provinces and cities: 1. In addition to completing the projects that were not completed in 1952, actively prepare various conditions for serving large-scale industries; 2. Establish and strengthen design and construction institutions, and vigorously develop the building materials industry; 3. Develop local industries that are urgently needed by the people based on conditions. As a result of the audit based on the above principles, the industrial basic construction plans of the provinces and cities are now fully in line with the investment figures controlled by the central government. Based on actual needs, the provinces and cities have made appropriate adjustments to the investment ratio. Some have increased investment, and some have reduced investment.

    西北今年地方工业基本建设计划审核完毕
    据新华社讯：西北各省、市一九五三年的工业基本建设计划，已由西北行政委员会财政经济委员会审核完毕。在审核这些计划中，西北行政委员会财政经济委员会严格遵照中央指示，控制了投资数字，并批判了某些省市在工业建设上的盲目思想，对原计划中不切合实际的工程项目，根据实际需要，作了必要的增删。
    西北各省市早在去年年底就已编制了一九五三年的工业基本建设计划，但当时由于编制计划的人员对于地方工业的发展方向认识不够明了，缺乏全局观点，编制的计划盲目性很大，表现出严重的“摆摊子”现象。如甘肃省开始编计划时，曾提出开办不必要的酱油厂、糖厂等。该省在计划中准备开办的兰州纸厂，从一九五零年即开始筹办，因条件不具备，始终没得到批准施工。经过调查，现在才知道该地造纸原料不够，从外区调纸浆又不可能，产品也没有销路，开办起来肯定是要垮台的。但该省人民政府工业厅负责干部却埋怨上级说：“一九五二年没有批准施工，起码少赚了一百亿元。”陕西省编制的工业基本建设计划中，零星的基本建设项目就预算花费六十亿元，但关于为大工业建设服务的建筑材料厂、资源勘探、培养干部等项目，却很少投资。宝鸡宏文纸厂因设备陈旧，产品质量很差，积压了大量纸张销不出去，但在基本建设计划中，他们仍然计划再把这个纸厂扩大。新疆省编制的工业基本建设计划，大多没有考虑到产销关系。迪化市原有一座足可供应全市人民需要的面粉厂，但他们在计划中，又提出再新建一座比旧厂大两倍的面粉厂。迪化火柴厂生产成本很高，产品售价超过青岛运去的火柴价格，但该省还计划迁移厂址后再进行扩充。
    西北财政经济委员会在审核各省市的工业基本建设计划时，是按照下列原则进行的：一、除完成一九五二年未完工的工程外，应积极准备为大工业服务的各项条件；二、建立和充实设计、建筑机构，大力发展建筑材料工业；三、根据条件发展人民急需的地方工业。根据上述原则审核的结果，各省市工业基本建设计划已完全符合中央控制的投资数字。根据实际需要，各省市在投资比例上，进行了适当的调剂。有的增加了投资，有的减少了投资。
