(Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 20th) The CCP Central Committee East China Bureau convened a reporting meeting on February 5th regarding the handling of people's letters and the reception of the masses by East China-level organs. The meeting was presided over by Tan Zhenlin, Third Secretary of the East China Bureau. The meeting heard reports from responsible cadres of the General Office and Discipline Inspection Committee of the CCP Central Committee East China Bureau, the General Office of the East China Administrative Council, the People's Supervisory Committee, the East China Branch of the Supreme People's Procuratorate of the Central People's Government, the Liberation Daily, and the East China People's Broadcasting Station. These reports indicated that since the "Three-Anti" campaign, especially since the East China Bureau handled the Huang Yifeng incident, people's letters and visits have increased rapidly. For example, after the Huang Yifeng incident was handled, the Liberation Daily received more than 6,000 letters from readers in the eleven days from January 21st to 31st, double the usual amount. The work of handling people's letters and receiving the masses by East China-level organs and the organs of various provinces and cities has made considerable progress under continuous inspection and supervision. However, many organs still adopt an irresponsible attitude towards this work, and some difficulties in handling people's letters have not been properly resolved.

Tan Zhenlin, Third Secretary of the CCP Central Committee East China Bureau, gave important instructions at the meeting. He pointed out: People's letters have exposed many bad people and bad deeds to us. We must continue to grasp and deepen the inspection, and concentrate our firepower to resolutely fight against those bad elements. In handling such incidents, we must grasp the basic principle of seizing typical cases and carrying them through to the end. Criticism should be directed at organs and newspapers that adopt a conciliatory or compromising attitude or lack the courage to fight. Good deeds and good people should also be appropriately commended. In order to better handle various problems revealed in people's letters or visits, East China-level organs should, according to their respective business systems, grasp the work of promoting this work in their subordinate departments. We should also make more use of telephone inquiries and expediting, and major events should involve summoning the parties concerned to meetings or talks to improve efficiency. In addition, a joint office for handling people's letters and receiving the masses should be established to concentrate forces, unify leadership, and set up more reception rooms to achieve simplicity and speed.

Zhang Dingcheng, Fourth Secretary of the East China Bureau, emphasized in his speech: Every struggle must be carried out thoroughly. Like the Huang Yifeng incident, the East China Communications Department and the East China Transportation College must be thoroughly transformed. At present, some leading cadres have ideas and behaviors of condoning or even shielding their subordinates when they make mistakes, which must be resolutely opposed.

At the end of the meeting, Chen Yi, Second Secretary of the East China Bureau, repeatedly explained the great political significance of handling people's letters and receiving the masses. He said: The people have suffering and tell us, which shows that the people trust the Communist Party. Our Party leads such a large country, and the situation is so complicated that many things would be unknown to us without the exposure of people's letters. Only by relying on the masses, only when the people dare to speak out, can we understand the situation and do our work well. The Chinese people have carried out a long-term democratic struggle. For decades, they have overthrown the tyrannical landlord class. Now, we must carry out a resolute struggle and resolutely carry out the struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of laws and disciplines widely, deeply, and thoroughly, and never compromise. All organs, especially the Party's discipline inspection organs, people's supervisory organs, and Party newspapers, must, in this spirit, do more good things for the people and the Party, consciously and actively fight against bad people and bad deeds, especially against bad elements like Huang Yifeng, who are of bad character, powerful, and form a group.

    中共中央华东局召开汇报会议检查处理人民来信来访的工作
    【新华社上海二十日电】中共中央华东局在二月五日召开华东一级机关处理人民来信和接见人民群众工作的汇报会议，会议由华东局第三书记谭震林主持。会议听取了中共中央华东局办公厅和纪律检查委员会，华东行政委员会办公厅，人民监察委员会，中央人民政府最高人民检察署华东分署，解放日报社，华东人民广播电台等单位负责干部的汇报。从这些汇报中可以看出：“三反”以来，特别是华东局处理黄逸峰事件以来，人民来信、来访迅速增加。例如在处理黄逸峰事件后，从一月二十一日到三十一日十一天内，解放日报社收到的读者来信即有六千余件，较平时增加一倍。华东一级机关和各省、市机关的处理人民来信和接见人民群众的工作，在不断检查督促下，也有不少进步；但是，还有不少机关对这一工作仍采取不负责任的态度，处理人民来信工作中还有一些困难没有得到适当解决。
    中共中央华东局第三书记谭震林在会上作了重要指示，他指出：人民来信向我们揭发了许多坏人坏事，我们必须继续抓紧深入检查，集中火力向那些坏分子进行坚决斗争。在处理这类事件时，必须掌握抓住典型、贯彻到底的基本方针。对采取调和妥协态度或缺乏斗争勇气的机关、报纸，应当提出批评。对作得好的，对好人好事，也应适当表扬。为了更好地处理人民来信或来访中所揭发的各种问题，华东一级机关应按各自的业务系统抓紧所属部门推动此项工作。还应多利用电话询问、催办，重大事件应将当事人调来开会或谈话，以提高办事效率。此外，还应成立处理人民来信与接见人民群众的联合办公室，以集中力量，统一领导，多设接待室，作到简便迅速。
    华东局第四书记张鼎丞在讲话中着重指出：每一个斗争要开展得彻底，像黄逸峰事件，就一定要把华东交通部、华东交通专科学校彻底改造好。现在有些领导干部当他领导下的干部犯了错误时，有姑息以至包庇的思想和行为，必须坚决反对。
    会议结束时，华东局第二书记陈毅反复地说明了处理人民来信及接见人民群众的重大政治意义。他说：人民有疾苦，向我们讲，这说明人民信任共产党。我们党领导这样大的国家，情况又这样复杂，许多事情，如果没有人民来信揭发，我们是不知道的。只有依靠人民群众，只有人民敢讲话，我们才能了解情况，作好工作。中国人民进行了长期的民主斗争，几十年来，斗倒了恶霸地主阶级，现在还要作坚决的斗争，一定要把反官僚主义、反命令主义、反违法乱纪的斗争开展得又广又深又透，绝不妥协。各个机关，特别是党的纪律检查机关，人民监察机关，党的报纸，都要本着这种精神，替人民替党作更多的好事，有意识地、主动地向坏人坏事作斗争，特别是向黄逸峰那样的品质恶劣的有权有势、形成一个集团的坏分子进行坚决的斗争。
