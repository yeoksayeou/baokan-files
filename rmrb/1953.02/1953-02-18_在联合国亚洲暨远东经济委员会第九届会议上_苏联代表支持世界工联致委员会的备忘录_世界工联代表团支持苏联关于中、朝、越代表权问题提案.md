Xinhua News Agency, Wanlong: On February 10, the Ninth Session of the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East concluded its discussion on the economic situation of Asian and Far Eastern countries. Representatives of these countries acknowledged during the discussion that although their countries possess abundant natural resources and manpower, the people of these countries suffer deeply from poverty and hunger due to the plunder by colonial monopoly capital.

Representatives from Ceylon, Indonesia, and Burma all mentioned that the prices of their exported raw materials are extremely low, while the prices of their imported major equipment are very high, which hinders the development of the national economy and exacerbates unemployment and poverty.

The delegation of the World Federation of Trade Unions, attending the meeting, issued a memorandum that has been distributed to the representatives attending the meeting by the Executive Secretary of the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East. This memorandum truthfully described the difficult economic situation of Asian and Far Eastern countries and pointed out the causes of this situation.

The Soviet representative supported the demands made in the memorandum of the World Federation of Trade Unions delegation and urged the representatives attending the meeting of the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East to study the recommendations in this memorandum.

In the process of discussing the economic situation of Asian and Far Eastern countries, two proposals were put forward. The proposal put forward by the Soviet representative outlined specific measures to ensure the development of national industries in Asian and Far Eastern countries—first and foremost, heavy industry. The proposal of the Pakistani representative did not address the actual economic situation of Asian and Far Eastern countries, nor did it mention specific suggestions that could promote the development of national industries in Asian and Far Eastern countries.

Under the pressure of the US-British bloc, the Indian and Pakistani delegations opposed the proposal put forward by the Soviet delegation and supported the proposal favored by the colonial countries.

On February 11, the meeting began to discuss the reports of the Committee and its subcommittees.

Xinhua News Agency, Wanlong: The delegation of the World Federation of Trade Unions, which is attending the Ninth Session of the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East in Wanlong, Indonesia, submitted a written statement to the Chairman of the meeting after the Soviet delegation proposed to expel the so-called representatives of the Kuomintang remnants and invite representatives of the People's Republic of China to attend the meeting, and to expel representatives of the Li Seung-man clique and the Bao Dai puppet government, expressing full support for the Soviet proposals.

The statement said: The delegation of the World Federation of Trade Unions fully supports the two proposals put forward by the Soviet delegation regarding the representation of China, Korea, and Vietnam, because these proposals are correct and reasonable, and at the same time, they are in line with the wishes of the broad working people in this region.

The statement pointed out: The fact that the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China has achieved various accomplishments in the three years since the founding of the country proves that it is a government that represents the entire Chinese people and is deeply supported by the people of the whole country. The People's Republic of China adheres to a peaceful foreign policy, has established friendly diplomatic relations with many countries, and has developed trade with various countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. The role and influence of the People's Republic of China in world affairs, especially in Asian affairs, cannot be denied or ignored.

The statement emphasized: The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China is the only legal government representing the Chinese people, and it has the right to send its representatives to participate in the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East. The Kuomintang remnants, eking out an existence under the armed protection of the US government, have long been spurned by the Chinese people, and have completely lost any qualification to represent the Chinese people. The World Federation of Trade Unions believes that allowing the so-called representatives of the Kuomintang remnants to appear in the meeting place of the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East until now, while repeatedly and illegally excluding representatives of the People's Republic of China, which has 475 million people, is not only a violation of the principles of the United Nations Charter, but also contrary to the wishes and interests of the Asian people.

When talking about the issue of representation of Korea and Vietnam, the statement said: Everyone knows that the Li Seung-man regime has long been spurned by the Korean people, and its existence is only because the US government needs it. Even with the military support of the US and French ruling classes, the Bao Dai regime controls less than one-tenth of the territory of Vietnam, and even in the areas it controls, it is widely opposed by the people.

The statement concluded: In order for the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East to truly become an organization of relevant Asian countries and effectively carry out the tasks assigned to it by the people of Asian countries (especially regarding the economic development of Asian and Far Eastern countries and the improvement of people's living standards), the delegation of the World Federation of Trade Unions, representing more than 80 million organized workers, believes that it is necessary to expel the Kuomintang representatives who cannot truly represent China, invite representatives of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China to participate in the work of the committee, and expel the representatives of South Korea and Bao Dai Vietnam.

We are very disappointed with the decision made by this session to postpone the discussion of the issue of China's representation to the next session.

    在联合国亚洲暨远东经济委员会第九届会议上
    苏联代表支持世界工联致委员会的备忘录
    世界工联代表团支持苏联关于中、朝、越代表权问题提案
     【新华社十七日讯】塔斯社万隆讯：二月十日，联合国亚洲暨远东经济委员会第九届会议结束了关于亚洲和远东国家经济情况的讨论。这些国家的代表在讨论时承认：虽然他们国家拥有丰富的天然资源和人力，但由于殖民国家垄断资本的掠夺，这些国家的人民深深受到贫困和饥饿的痛苦。
    锡兰、印尼和缅甸的代表都谈到，他们出口的原料价格是极其低廉的，而他们进口的主要装备的价格却是很高的，这样就使国民经济的发展受到阻碍，失业和贫困愈来愈严重。
    出席这次会议的世界工会联合会代表团发表了一项备忘录，已由亚洲暨远东经济委员会执行秘书分发给参加这次会议的代表。这项备忘录如实地叙述了亚洲和远东国家的困难的经济情况，并指出造成这种情况的原因。
    苏联代表支持世界工会联合会代表团备忘录提出的要求，并敦促参加亚洲暨远东经济委员会会议的代表研究这个备忘录中的建议。
    在讨论亚洲及远东国家经济情况的过程中，有两个提案被提出。苏联代表提出的提案概述了保证发展亚洲和远东国家的民族工业——首先是重工业——的具体措施。巴基斯坦代表的提案没有谈到亚洲及远东国家实际的经济情况，也没有提到可以促进亚洲及远东国家民族工业的发展的具体建议。
    印度和巴基斯坦代表团在美英集团的压力之下，反对苏联代表团提出的提案，而支持殖民国所嘉许的提案。
    二月十一日，会议开始讨论委员会和小组委员会的报告。
     【新华社十七日讯】万隆消息：列席在印尼万隆举行的联合国亚洲暨远东经济委员会第九届会议的世界工会联合会代表团，在苏联代表团提出驱逐国民党残余匪帮的所谓代表并邀请中华人民共和国代表出席会议的提案和驱逐李承晚集团代表和保大傀儡政府代表的提案后，向会议主席提出书面声明，表示完全支持苏联的提案。
    声明说：世界工会联合会代表团完全支持苏联代表团所提的关于中国、朝鲜和越南代表权的两项提案，因为这些提案是正确的和合理的，同时是符合本区域广大劳动人民的愿望的。
    声明指出：中华人民共和国中央人民政府在建国以来三年多的时间中获得各项成就的事实，证明它是一个代表全中国人民、深受全国人民拥护的政府。中华人民共和国坚持和平的外交政策，已经和许多国家建立了友好的外交关系，并发展了和各国在平等互利的基础上的贸易。中华人民共和国在世界事务上特别在亚洲事务上所起的作用和影响是不能否认的，不能忽视的。
    声明强调说：中华人民共和国中央人民政府是代表中国人民的唯一合法的政府，它有权利派遣自己的代表参加联合国亚洲暨远东经济委员会。在美国政府的武装庇护下苟延残喘的国民党残余集团，早已被中国人民所唾弃，它完全失去了任何代表中国人民的资格。世界工会联合会认为，到现在为止仍然允许国民党残余集团的所谓代表出现在联合国亚洲暨远东经济委员会的会场上，而一再非法排斥拥有四亿七千五百万人民的中华人民共和国的代表出席，不但是违反了联合国宪章原则，也是和亚洲人民的愿望和利益相违背的。
    声明在谈到关于朝鲜和越南的代表权问题时说：谁都知道李承晚政权早已被朝鲜人民所唾弃，它的存在，只是因为美国政府需要它。而保大政权即使在美、法统治阶级的军事支持下，它所能控制的地区也不到越南国土的十分之一，而且就在它控制的地区内，也受到人民普遍的反对。
    声明最后说：为了使联合国亚洲暨远东经济委员会真正成为亚洲有关各国的组织，有效地执行亚洲各国人民所赋予它的任务（特别是关于亚洲及远东各国经济发展和提高人民生活水平），世界工会联合会代表团代表八千多万有组织的职工，认为必须驱逐不能真正代表中国的国民党代表，并邀请中华人民共和国中央人民政府的代表来参加委员会的工作，并且驱逐南朝鲜和保大越南的代表。
    我们对本届会议所通过的把中国代表权问题的讨论拖延到下一届会议，感到十分遗憾。
