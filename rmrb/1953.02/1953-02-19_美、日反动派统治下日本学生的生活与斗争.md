    Under the reactionary rule of the American occupiers and the Japanese Yoshida government, Japanese students are now suffering greatly.

    In the 1952 national budget formulated by the Japanese Yoshida reactionary government under the direction of U.S. imperialism, direct and indirect military expenditures accounted for 70 percent of the entire national budget, while education expenditures accounted for only 3 to 5 percent. In 1952, tuition fees at Japanese national universities doubled compared to 1951. Tuition fees at private universities were two to three times higher than those at national universities. School authorities do not allow those who cannot pay tuition on time to attend classes and even order them to withdraw from school. Currently, 50 percent of university students across Japan cannot pay tuition on time, and more than 80 percent of students have to work part-time or are even forced by life to sell their blood for one U.S. dollar per 100 cubic centimeters. The students' meals are very poor; for example, the daily caloric intake at Hitotsubashi University is less than 1,800 calories. Therefore, malnutrition is widespread among students, and the number of people suffering from tuberculosis is increasing.

    The American occupation forces have occupied more than 100 Japanese university and middle school buildings. As a result, many schools have to use mountaintops and open fields as classrooms or adopt shift teaching methods. Higher schools lack laboratories. The student self-government association of Toyo University held a meeting to protest the school authorities' neglect of students' studies and refusal to meet their reasonable demands. The Uji branch of Kyoto University originally planned to expand its campus on 50,000 tsubo (equivalent to more than 200 mu) of land near the school, but this plan had to be canceled because the "Security Forces" wanted to occupy the area.

    In Japan, the fascization of school education is already very obvious. The government forcibly adds military subjects to various university research departments. Hokkaido University recently established courses to investigate the topography of the Soviet Kuril Islands and Sakhalin. American secret agents and Japanese police often break into schools to investigate the thoughts of teachers and students. If the students rise up to oppose them, the police brutally beat and arrest them. On March 8, 1952, twenty-one progressive students at Waseda University were arrested. The school also announced that students who participated in the May Day activities would be expelled. Arrests have occurred one after another at universities in Tokyo, Hokkaido, and other places.

    Japanese students have such difficult conditions for studying, but what awaits them upon graduation is unemployment. Among the 126,000 students graduating from high schools across Japan in March 1953, 80 percent will be unemployed because they cannot find jobs. Japanese students who participate in patriotic movements or express dissatisfaction with the U.S. military are regarded as "Reds," making it even more difficult for them to find employment. In July 1952, the Japan Federation of Employers' Associations and the presidents of Hitotsubashi, Tokyo, Waseda and other universities held a symposium on student employment problems, where they put forward the condition of "preventing Reds from getting into companies to work."

    Japanese students have increasingly clearly recognized that U.S. imperialism and the Japanese reactionaries are their mortal enemies. Therefore, they have gradually realized that they must resolutely fight together with the entire Japanese people for national independence and democratic freedom, and to defend the vital rights of young students. Especially since the spring of 1952, the Japanese student movement has surged unprecedentedly. On April 28, 1952, when the reactionary Yoshida government announced that the separate peace treaty, the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," and the "Administrative Agreement" officially came into effect, students across the country declared this day as a day of national shame. They held general strikes and flew flags at half-mast to express their anger. In the struggle, Japanese students have gradually combined with the workers' and peasants' movements. In 1952 alone, 200,000 students responded to the Japanese working class's five national general strikes and held two general strikes. During the summer vacation of 1952, a large number of students went to the countryside, lived with the peasants, and experienced the peasants' suffering. Japanese students also participated in the united front of all sectors of youth to fight for the vital rights of youth. On August 14, 1952, under the leadership of the Japan Youth Fatherland Front, 282 groups selected 492 representatives and convened the All-Japan Conference for the Protection of Youth Rights in Tokyo. Universities across the country also sent their representatives to attend, putting forward hundreds of demands related to the vital rights of students. The conference passed seven resolutions, including opposing conscription, prohibiting the use of atomic weapons, and immediately stopping the Korean War. Japanese students especially oppose the conscription system of the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries, which uses young people as cannon fodder. On September 27, 1952, Tokyo students convened a city-wide student rally at Tokyo University to oppose conscription. At the meeting, the students unanimously resolved to thoroughly carry out the struggle against conscription and rearmament, and to implement this slogan among workers and peasants. Currently, under the call of the "Youth and Women's Anti-Conscription Association," students across Japan are actively collecting signatures against conscription.

    Japanese students are also enthusiastically participating in the peace movement. On December 28 and 29, 1952, the All-Japan Student Self-Government Association held its first National Student Peace Conference in Tokyo. Three hundred representatives selected by 170 units participated in the conference. The Student Peace Struggle Program formulated by the conference stipulates that the peace movement should be combined with daily struggles against the colonial system and against militaristic education, and that the peace movement should be expanded among the masses.

### 美、日反动派统治下日本学生的生活与斗争

    美、日反动派统治下日本学生的生活与斗争
    在美国占领者和日本吉田政府的反动统治下，日本学生现在正遭受着很大的苦难。
    日本吉田反动政府在美帝国主义指使下所制定的一九五二年度的国家预算中，直接和间接军事预算占了整个国家预算的百分之七十，而教育经费仅有百分之三到百分之五。一九五二年日本国立大学的学费增加到一九五一年的两倍。私立大学的学费比国立大学的学费更高出二、三倍。学校当局对不能按期缴纳学费者不允许听课，甚至勒令退学。现在全日本有百分之五十的大学生不能按期缴纳学费，百分之八十以上的学生只好半工半读，甚至被生活所迫竟以一百立方公分换一块美元的价格出卖自己的鲜血。学生们的伙食很不好，如一桥大学一天的伙食的热量连一千八百卡路里都不到。所以学生中普遍存在着营养不良的现象，患肺结核病的人数也日益增加。
    美国占领军占据了一百多所日本大学和中学的校舍，因此好多学校只好以山头和旷野作为教室或采取轮班上课的办法。高等学校缺乏实验室，东洋大学学生自治会为此曾召开会议，抗议学校当局忽视学生学业而拒绝学生的合理要求。京都大学宇治分校本拟在该校附近五万坪（相当于二百多亩地）土地上扩充校舍，可是由于“保安队”要占用这个地方，只好取消这一打算。
    在日本，学校教育的法西斯化已很明显。政府强制在各个大学研究室里添设军事课目，北海道大学最近竟为调查苏联的千岛列岛和库页岛等地的地形而设立课程。美国特务和日本警察常常闯入学校调查教师和学生的思想。如果学生们起来反对，警察就野蛮地殴打和逮捕他们。一九五二年三月八日，早稻田大学有二十一名进步学生被捕。该校校方并曾宣布，凡参加“五一”节活动的学生，就要予以退学处分。在东京、北海道等大学都曾接二连三地发生逮捕的事件。
    日本学生的求学条件是这样艰难，但在毕业时等待他们的却是失业。在一九五三年三月毕业的日本全国高等学校的十二万六千个学生中，将有百分之八十的人因找不到工作而失业。日本学生因为参加爱国运动或对美军表示不满，就被视为“赤色分子”，这样的学生就更不容易找到职业，在一九五二年七月，日本经营者团体联盟与一桥、东京、早稻田等大学的校长在举行学生就业问题的座谈会上，曾提出“防止赤色分子混进公司去工作”的条件。
    日本学生已日益清楚地认识到美帝国主义和日本反动派是他们的死敌，因此他们已经逐渐觉悟到要和全日本人民一起为要求民族独立和民主自由，为保卫青年学生切身权利而坚决斗争。特别是一九五二年春季以来，日本的学生运动空前高涨。一九五二年四月二十八日当吉田反动政府宣布单独和约、美日“安全条约”和“行政协定”正式生效时，全国广大学生宣布这个日子为国耻日，他们举行总罢课和挂半旗来表示他们的愤怒。日本学生在斗争中已逐渐和工农运动结合起来，一九五二年一年内，二十万学生曾响应日本工人阶级的五次全国性总罢工，并举行了两次总罢课。一九五二年暑假时，大批的学生下乡，与农民生活在一起，体验农民的痛苦。日本学生并参加了各界青年的统一战线，为保卫青年切身权利而斗争。一九五二年八月十四日，在日本青年祖国战线领导下，二百八十二个团体选派了四百九十二名代表，在东京召开了全日本保卫青年权利大会，全国各大学也选派了自己的代表出席，提出了几百项有关学生切身权利的要求。大会上作出了反对征兵、禁止使用原子武器、立即停止朝鲜战争等七项决议。日本学生特别反对美、日反动派利用青年当炮灰的征兵制度。在一九五二年九月二十七日，东京学生在东京大学召开全市学生反对征兵奋起大会。学生们在大会上一致决议要彻底进行反对征兵、反对重整军备的斗争，并把这一口号贯彻到工人和农民中去。目前，全日本学生正在“青年与妇女反对征兵会”的号召下，积极地征集反对征兵的签名。
    日本学生也在热烈地参加保卫和平运动。在一九五二年十二月二十八、二十九两天，全日本学生自治会总联合会在东京召开了首次全国学生和平大会。参加大会的有一百七十个单位所选派的三百名代表。大会制订的学生和平斗争纲领中规定：把和平运动与日常反对殖民制度、反对军国主义化的教育等斗争结合起来，在群众中扩大和平运动。                           （新华社）
