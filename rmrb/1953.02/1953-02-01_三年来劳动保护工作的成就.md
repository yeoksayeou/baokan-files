Achievements in Labor Protection Work Over the Past Three Years

Under the leadership and care of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, significant achievements have been made in labor protection work in factories and mines across the country over the past three years. According to statistics from the Ministry of Labor of the Central People's Government, work-related injuries and deaths among factory and mine workers nationwide have decreased year by year. Looking at the average monthly figures, death accidents in 1951 decreased by 10.7% compared to 1950, and serious injury accidents decreased by 9.6%; in 1952, death accidents decreased by 39.1% compared to 1951, and serious injury accidents decreased by 38.3% (but minor injury accidents increased).

The above achievements were primarily due to the criticism of the capitalist ideology of "valuing machines over people" and the purely task-oriented view in state-owned enterprises, the ideology of "emphasizing production and neglecting safety." In state-owned factories and mines, the idea of unifying production and safety began to be established. Second, the central industrial departments and labor administrative departments promulgated 119 relevant labor protection laws, regulations, and systems, promoting state-owned or private enterprises to improve labor protection work and safety and health conditions. For example, factories such as the Northeast 478 and 623 established sound safety education systems. New workers receive training on safety regulations from the technical security department upon entering the factory, enabling them to understand and master the knowledge and technology of safe production. They are assigned work only after passing an examination and receiving a certificate. At the same time, these factories have strict inspection systems, safety responsibility systems, and reward systems, thus basically eliminating casualties. Third, administrative leaders in state-owned factories and mines have made great efforts in labor protection construction. For example, the national coal mines have adopted mechanical ventilation in 90% of cases, which is twice as much as before liberation. Fourth, the broad masses of workers have played an active role in improving safety and health conditions. Coal mines, power industries, and postal and telecommunications trade unions have organized extensive safety production campaigns. Safety production model workers such as Shi Yuhai and Gao Wenqiao have emerged among the workers. For example, the Jiaozuo Coal Mine launched a safety production campaign, completely eliminating deaths in the first half of last year, and the work-related injury rate per 10,000 tons of coal produced decreased by 90% compared to 1949. Fifth, and particularly important, is that safety and hygiene inspections have been universally carried out under the leadership of Party committees in various places over the past three years. In the Northeast region, four to five general inspections have been carried out. Experience has proven that safety and hygiene inspections are a good way to improve labor protection work. Through inspections, the idea of attaching importance to safety is established. Some administrative leaders have discovered many problems that they did not know about in the past, and were greatly surprised, becoming alert ideologically. In particular, many urgent problems that needed to be solved were resolved through inspections. For example, in 183 factories inspected in East China last year, the masses put forward more than 460,000 opinions related to safety and hygiene, of which 60% to 70% were resolved through the efforts of the masses themselves and the assistance of administrative leaders. After the inspections in various places, many safety production regulations and systems were generally established, and the broad masses (including all workers, staff, and even leading cadres) received profound safety and health education, laying a good foundation for further improving safety and health conditions and promoting safety production campaigns.

Although labor protection work in state-owned mines and factories has achieved great results, it is still very uneven among regions, industries, and mines and factories. Some have done a very poor job, accidents still occur constantly, and the worker disease rate and absenteeism rate are still high. According to statistics, minor injury accidents increased in 1952 compared to the past, affecting the completion of production tasks. The reasons are as follows:

One, the idea of unifying safety and production has not yet been universally and firmly established. For example, on May 7 last year, a water inrush accident occurred in the Xingfeng Coal Mine in Xingyang County, Henan Province. There were signs of a water hazard in advance, and the workers suggested that it should be prevented, but the factory management not only did not adopt the suggestion but instead led the team down the mine themselves. As a result, water poured into the mine, causing serious casualties and property losses of more than 500 million yuan. This is a common ideological problem that exists not only in administrative leadership, but also among general engineering and technical personnel, and even trade union cadres and workers. The cadres of the labor administration departments have also not done enough to supervise and urge.

Two, key safety and health equipment issues have not been resolved in a planned way. Facts have proven that many accidents occur because the equipment is not good. According to incomplete statistics from the Ministry of Labor, the number of casualties caused by the lack of safety equipment accounts for 34% in some places, and even more than 40% in some places.

Three, many safety regulations and systems are not yet sound or practical. Many regulations and systems have not been implemented among the masses and remain on paper. Some units have not provided safety technology education to the masses, or the education is not sufficient. For example, the Ministry of Fuel Industry held an examination on safety operating procedures in a certain mining area. 31% of the leading cadres failed, more than 70% of the middle and lower-level cadres failed, and some trade union cadres in charge also failed. Therefore, the operating procedures cannot be implemented.

Four, excessive overtime and excessive meetings in spare time cause workers to be over-fatigued, which can also easily lead to injuries and deaths. According to statistics from the Yibin City Labor Section in Sichuan Province, the 602 Paper Mill had 10,377 hours of overtime in September and October alone last year, and workers were often mobilized for voluntary overtime.

Five, the labor protection agencies are not yet sound, there are few full-time cadres, and there is a particular lack of safety technicians.

In the private sector, under the leadership of the People's Government, the supervision and assistance of trade union organizations and the masses of workers, and the efforts of some progressive industrialists and businessmen, safety and health conditions have improved to some extent compared to before liberation. Facts have proven that the combination of production and safety not only protects the health of workers, but also benefits the capitalists due to increased production. For example, the trade union of the Jinan private Chengtong Textile Factory assisted the capitalists in improving the workshop ventilation equipment. The symptoms caused by stuffiness and heat among workers were significantly reduced, and the attendance rate increased from 85% to 98%. Workers' labor productivity has also improved, and the average output per machine in eight hours has increased from 30.5 yards to 33 yards. However, in many private enterprises, the view of "only wanting workers to work, regardless of their lives" is still expressed from time to time, labor conditions are still very poor, and work-related injuries and deaths are still very serious. For example, the Furu Well capitalist in Zigong City has always attached no importance to worker safety and purchased old boilers for use. An explosion occurred on May 10 last year, injuring and killing 15 people. Another example is the Zhongtangqiao Hengxing Renji Oil Factory in Wujin County, Jiangsu Province. In order to save money, the capitalist bought an old boiler. The workers believed it was dangerous and suggested installing a safety valve, improving the water pump, and delaying the start for two days, but the capitalist was eager to make profits, saying that it was "trial operation while thinking of ways." As a result, an explosion occurred, killing and injuring 13 workers.

From the above situation, there are still many shortcomings in labor protection work in factories and mines, and the situation in private enterprises is more serious than in state-owned enterprises. Therefore, it is necessary to vigorously implement the spirit of the National Labor Protection Work Conference and improve labor protection work to ensure the smooth progress of large-scale economic construction.

    三年来劳动保护工作的成就
    三年来，在中国共产党和毛主席的领导与关怀之下，全国厂矿企业劳动保护工作取得了很大成绩。据中央人民政府劳动部的统计，全国厂矿职工伤亡事故，逐年减少。按每月平均数字看，一九五一年比一九五○年死亡事故减少了百分之十点七，重伤事故减少了百分之九点六；一九五二年比一九五一年死亡事故减少了百分之三十九点一，重伤事故减少了百分之三十八点三（但轻伤事故则有增加）。
    所以取得以上的成绩，首先是由于对资本主义的“只重视机器不重视人”的思想和国营企业中单纯任务观点，“只重生产，忽视安全”的思想进行了批判工作。在国营厂矿企业中，开始建立了生产与安全统一的思想。第二，中央各产业主管部门及劳动行政部门，颁布了一百一十九种有关劳动保护的法令规程和制度，推动了国营或私营企业改善劳动保护工作和安全卫生状况。如东北四七八、六二三等厂建立了健全的安全教育制度，新工人入厂均由技术保安科讲解安全规程，使工人了解和掌握安全生产的知识和技术，经考试合格发给证书才分配工作；同时这些厂又有严格的检查制度、安全责任制度和奖励制度，因而基本上消灭了伤亡事故。第三，在国营厂矿企业中，行政领导方面对劳动保护建设工作尽了很大的努力。如全国煤矿采用机械通风的已达百分之九十，较解放前增加了两倍。第四，广大职工群众发挥积极作用，改进了安全卫生状况。煤矿、电业、邮电工会等都组织了广泛的安全生产竞赛运动。在工人中涌现了施玉海、高文桥等安全生产竞赛模范。又如焦作煤矿开展了安全生产运动，去年上半年全矿完全消灭了死亡事故，每产一万吨煤的工伤事故也比一九四九年减少了百分之九十。第五，特别重要的，是三年来各地在党委领导下普遍进行了安全卫生大检查。在东北地区就普遍地检查了四次至五次。经验证明，安全卫生大检查对改进劳动保护工作是一个很好的办法。通过检查建立重视安全的思想，有些行政领导干部发现了许多过去不知道的问题，大吃一惊，从思想上开始警惕起来。特别是通过检查解决了许多迫切需要解决的问题。如华东去年检查的一百八十三个工厂中，群众提出了四十六万余条有关安全卫生的意见，其中百分之六十至七十由于群众自己的努力和行政领导干部的帮助得到了解决。各地检查以后普遍建立了许多安全生产的规程制度，并且使广大群众（包括全体工人、职员以至领导干部）受到了深刻的安全卫生教育，在此基础上开展了安全生产运动，为进一步改善安全卫生状况打下了良好的基础。
    国营矿厂企业中劳动保护工作虽然获得很大成绩，但各地区、各产业、各矿厂之间还很不平衡，有的做得还很差，伤亡事故仍不断发生，工人疾病率和缺勤率还很大。据统计，一九五二年轻伤事故较前还有增加，影响着生产任务的完成。其原因有以下几点：
    一、安全与生产统一的思想，还未普遍地巩固地建立起来。如河南荥阳县荥丰煤矿去年五月七日发生透水事故，事先已有滋水的危险象征，工人们建议应当预防，但该厂管理人员不但不采纳反而自己带领下窑，结果井下出水，发生严重伤亡事故，损失财产五亿余元。这是带有普遍性的思想问题，不仅行政领导上如此，在一般工程技术人员中，甚至工会干部和工人群众中也是存在的，劳动行政部门的干部也检查督促不够。
    二、有关安全卫生关键性设备方面的问题还没有有计划地解决，事实证明有许多事故的发生，就是因为设备不好。根据中央劳动部不完全的统计，由于没有安全设备发生伤亡事故的，有的地方占百分之三十四，有的地方甚至达到百分之四十以上。
    三、许多安全规程制度还不健全、不切合实际。许多规程制度没有贯彻到群众中去，还停留在纸上。有的单位没有对群众进行安全技术教育，或教育得不够。如燃料工业部在某矿区举行了一次安全操作规程的考试，领导干部中有百分之三十一不及格，中下级干部中有百分之七十以上不及格，工会负责干部中也有不及格的。因而操作规程就无法贯彻下去。
    四、加班加点和业余时间会议过多，使工人疲劳过度，也容易发生伤亡事故。据四川省宜宾市劳动科的统计，六○二造纸厂仅去年九、十两月，加班加点即达一万零三百七十七小时，并经常发动工人义务加班。
    五、劳动保护的机构还不健全，专职干部很少，特别是安全技术人员还很缺乏。
    私营企业方面，在人民政府的领导、工会组织和工人群众的督促帮助，以及某些进步工商业者的努力下，安全卫生状况较解放前也有了一些改善。事实证明，生产与安全相结合不仅维护了工人的健康，而且由于生产提高对资方也有利。如济南私营成通纺织厂工会协助资方改善了车间通风设备，工人因闷热而造成的病症显著减少，出勤率由百分之八十五增加到百分之九十八。工人劳动生产率也有提高，每台车八小时平均产量由三十点五码增至三十三码。但在许多私营企业中，“只要工人干活，不管工人死活”的观点还时有表现，劳动条件还很恶劣，伤亡事故仍十分严重。如自贡市福如井资方一贯不重视工人安全，购买破旧锅炉使用，去年五月十日发生爆炸，伤亡十五人。又如江苏武进县中塘桥恒兴仁记油厂，资方为了省钱，买了一个旧锅炉，工人认为危险，建议安装安全阀，改善水泵，缓开两天，但资方急于图利，说是“一面试用，一面想法”。结果发生爆炸事故，死伤工人十三人。
    从以上情况来看，厂矿企业中的劳动保护工作的缺点仍然是很多的，私营企业比国营企业更为严重。因此，必须大力贯彻全国劳动保护工作会议精神，把劳动保护工作提高一步，以保证大规模经济建设的顺利进行。
