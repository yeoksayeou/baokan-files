Some Opinions on Literary and Artistic Creation
	Wu Zuguang

　　From 1937, when I began to learn writing, until before the liberation in 1949, during these twelve years I wrote more than nine multi-act plays, one one-act play, created and adapted six film scripts, and a collection of essays. These works were all performed, filmed, and published.

　　In the three years since liberation, I have almost stopped creating, only adapting and directing a film "Ode to the Red Flag", writing a Ping opera script "Cowherd and Weaver Girl", and writing some short articles.

　　In the dark days of old China, I never felt a shortage of subject matter in my creative life; on the contrary, often while writing one work, I would be brewing or completing the theme of the next work. At that time, life was full of resistance to the unreasonable social system, so my creations mostly focused on exposing and satirizing darkness and resisting oppression. Such themes were truly everywhere.

　　After liberation, my creative source seemed to be suddenly blocked. The reason is nothing more than insufficient study, a lack of life experience, and low political and ideological levels; I had a narrow vision, not only failing to see the future of reality, but also failing to see the contradictions in real life. In such a situation, the possibility of creation is very small.

　　Another reason is that my work has changed. After liberation, I took on the job of film director, and in fact and in consciousness, I was detached from writing. I couldn't write anything anyway, so this was the best way to "hide my clumsiness." On the other hand, I felt that writing outside of my film directing duties was "smuggling", a kind of undisciplined behavior? In 1951, when I accepted an invitation from a private local opera troupe to write the Ping opera "Cowherd and Weaver Girl", I asked the troupe not to put my name on the advertisement.

　　This was obviously unnecessary; the Film Bureau leadership never said that we were not allowed to engage in literary and artistic activities outside of our own tasks. Besides, it wasn't that I didn't have time; but I just didn't create, and even less did I study hard.

　　I think I should never give up on myself again; I should still create in my spare time outside of directing work.

　　After liberation, there are not a few writers who have created very little or not at all. But there are also many exceptions. Here is a good example, Mr. Lao She, who has been constantly creating. He gave us scripts like "Dragon Beard Ditch", "Fang Pearl", and "Willow Tree Well." He also had scripts that were written and rejected, revised again and again up to a dozen times and still not finalized. This shows that Mr. Lao She's creation also has many difficulties, but he has not stopped or retreated in the face of any difficulties. We should learn from Mr. Lao She.

　　In addition to the writers' insufficient subjective efforts, I think there are also shortcomings in criticism, a lack of affirmation and clear opinions, especially affirmation of the advantages. We need criticism, but we also need encouragement. Shortcomings should be pointed out, and advantages should also be affirmed. Critics should not be afraid to take responsibility, but should earnestly take on the responsibility of guiding creation.

　　For more than three years, the achievements of our literary and artistic creation have fallen far behind the demands of reality and the people. This easily reminds us of the achievements of our volunteers on the battlefield of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, the achievements of our workers in industrial construction and production, and the achievements of our liberated peasants in agricultural production. Our literature and art are for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and most writers are determined to learn from the workers, peasants, and soldiers, to go to factories, the countryside, and the troops to delve into life and transform their thinking. But in terms of creative achievements, we greatly lack the determination and courage to learn from, compete with, and even challenge the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Of course, literary and artistic works are not suitable to be compared with industrial and agricultural products; many of us have not transformed our thinking well enough, and we do not have enough familiarity and understanding of the new life and new things in the new society, and so on. But even so, even with all these difficulties factored in, our creative enthusiasm has not reached the proper height.

　　Our upsurge of literary and artistic creation must rise up. The past retreat and dull situation must be reversed. In addition to strengthening study and delving into life, should we consider changing the writers' way of life?

　　After liberation, writers have become literary and artistic cadres, taking living expenses from the government every day, and everyone's life has been guaranteed; but the government and the people have not strictly put forward any demands on us, and writers who have not created for three years have not been subjected to even slight criticism. After a day of eating and doing nothing, I often think: what is the difference between me and a loafer? Such a life may be one of the reasons for cultivating the writers' "supply system thinking."

　　Thus, I think that in order to promote the prosperity of literary and artistic creation and adapt to the needs of reality, we should consider changing the current way of life of writers. Changing the way of life of writers may be very complicated and not a simple issue; but I think first of all we should affirm: writers should maintain their lives with their creations. Creation is the result of the writer's labor, the writer's finished product. If in the future writers' royalties, manuscript fees, and performance taxes are guaranteed by the government as a system, this will be a sign of respect for labor for writers, readers, and audiences. The excellent creations of excellent writers will inevitably be loved by the masses, will inevitably win over a wide range of readers and audiences, and will inevitably receive relatively generous treatment as a result. This is what writers deserve, and it is naturally the most reasonable and practical encouragement. This encouragement will prompt writers to increase their labor. For writers who are not diligent enough, this is also a kind of stimulus.

　　For a period of more than ten years before liberation, my main income was from royalties, especially performance taxes. After liberation, I have not created anything, but I feel that the current emphasis on creative labor is obviously insufficient. Here I give my own example: In 1947, I wrote a mythological drama "Chang'e Flying to the Moon." In the three years since then, as far as I know: someone in Shanghai adapted it into a comic strip and adapted it into a Shanghai opera for performance; the Qingdao Federation of Literary and Art Circles adapted it into a Peking opera for performance; a certain theater troupe in Beijing changed the name and adapted it into a Peking opera for performance; the Liaoxi Provincial Cultural Troupe Puppet Theater team performed it as a puppet show. The authors of these adaptations and performances have all replaced them with other people's names, and there are many aspects of the changes that are worth discussing; but I myself have never even received a notice, and the rights that the author should have received are of course out of the question.

　　I think this situation is not an isolated case. To give another example, such as the most popular local opera "Little Son-in-Law." As far as I know, the characters, background, and most of the content are enough to show that this is adapted from Li Jianwu's drama "Youth." But Mr. Li Jianwu's name has never been associated with "Little Son-in-Law."

　　The rights and interests of writers should be protected. This means that the labor form of literary and artistic creation should receive the attention it deserves. This may be the beginning of changing the writers' way of life, that is, the right remedy for eliminating the writers' "supply system thinking." Doing so will inevitably require some steps and considerable time. But I believe that literary and artistic creation must be further developed and progressed after it is professionalized, which will be the driving force to promote the creative upsurge of our people's literature and art.

　　In addition, of course, there are many other things to consider. For example, some excellent writers have long assumed administrative responsibilities, and releasing them from the heavy burden of administrative affairs so that they can turn their efforts to creation is also something that should be considered.

### 对文艺创作的一些意见

    对文艺创作的一些意见
    吴祖光
    从一九三七年我开始学习写作起，到一九四九年解放以前为止，在这十二年之中我写过九个多幕话剧，一个独幕剧，创作和改编了六个电影剧本，一个散文集。这些作品都得到演出、拍摄和出版。
    在解放以后这三年多的时间，我几乎停止了创作，只改编并导演了一个电影片“红旗歌”，编写了一个评剧本“牛郎织女”，再写了一些短文。
    在旧中国的黑暗年代，在创作生活里我没有感到过题材的枯窘；相反，常常是在写作某一个作品时便酝酿或完成了下一作品的主题了。那时候生活里到处都是对不合理的社会制度的反抗，因此我的创作大都偏重在暴露与讽刺黑暗和反抗压迫这一方面。这样的题材真是俯拾即是。
    解放后，我的创作源泉好像突然堵塞了。原因没有别的，那自然就是学习不够，没有生活，政治水平、思想水平太低；目光如豆，不但看不到现实的前面，即使现实生活里的矛盾也看不出来。在这样的情况下，创作的可能性就太少了。
    另一个原因是我的工作变了。解放后我担任了电影导演的工作，事实上和意识上我是脱离了写作了。我本来就写不出东西来，这样正是“藏拙”的最好方法。另一方面，我觉得在电影导演的任务之外进行写作是不是“走私”，是不是一种无纪律的行为呢？在一九五一年我接受一个私营地方剧团的约请编写评剧“牛郎织女”时，我要求剧团在广告上不要登出我的名字。
    这显然是不必要的，电影局领导方面从来没有讲过不许我们从事本身任务以外的文艺活动。此外我也并不是没有时间；但是我就是没有创作，更没有好好学习。
    我想我再也不应该自暴自弃了，我仍应该在导演工作之外，利用剩余的时间来创作。
    解放以后，创作很少或没有创作的作家，不在少数。但也有许多是例外。这里有一个很好的范例，就是老舍先生，他始终在不停地创作。他给了我们像“龙须沟”，“方珍珠”，“柳树井”这样的剧本。他也有写成了而被否定的剧本，一改再改以至十几次修改而仍未定稿的剧本。这说明老舍先生的创作也是有很多困难的，但他在任何困难之前都没有停顿，退缩。我们应该好好地向老舍先生学习。
    除去作家的主观努力不够之外，我认为批评方面也有缺点，缺少肯定和明确的意见，尤其是对于优点的肯定。我们需要批评，更需要鼓励。缺点应该指出，优点也应该加以肯定。批评家不要怕负责任而是要切实地负起指导创作的责任来。
    三年多以来我们文学和艺术创作的成就远落在现实和人民的要求之后。这使我们很容易地想起我们的志愿军在抗美援朝的战场上的成就，我们的工人在工业建设生产方面的成就，我们的翻身农民在农业生产上的成就。我们的文艺是为工农兵的文艺，大部分作家们都决心向工农兵学习，下厂，下乡，下部队去深入生活来改造思想。而在创作的成绩方面来说，我们就大大地缺乏向工农兵学习，竞赛，以至于挑战的决心与勇气。固然文艺作品不适宜和工农业生产品相提并论；我们很多人的思想还没改造得好，对于新社会的新的生活新的事物还没有足够的熟悉和了解等等。但是即使如此，把这些困难都打在里面，我们的创作热潮还是没有达到应有的高度的。
    我们的文艺创作的热潮必需高涨起来。过去的退缩和沉闷的局面必须扭转。除去加强学习，深入生活之外，我们是否应当考虑一下改变作家们的生活方式的问题？
    作家们在解放后都作了文艺干部，每天向政府支取生活费，每个人的生活都得到了保障；而政府和人民并没有严格地对我们提出什么要求，三年没有创作的作家也没有受到那怕只是轻微的指责。饱食终日之余，我常常想到：我和二流子的区别何在呢？这样的生活未始不是养成了作家们的“供给制思想”的原因之一吧。
    这样我想到我们为了促成文艺创作的繁荣，适应现实的需要，我们应该考虑一下改变目前的作家们的生活方式的问题。改变作家的生活方式可能很复杂，不是一个简单的问题；但是我想首先我们应当肯定：作家应该以他的创作维持他的生活。创作就是作家劳动的结果，就是作家的生产成品。假如今后作家的版税，稿费，上演税都在政府的保障之下成为一种制度，这对于作家和读者观众来说就是对于劳动的重视。优秀的作家的优秀的创作必然得到群众的喜爱，必然争取到广大的读者和观众，也必然因此获得较为优厚的待遇。这是作家本份应得的，自然也就是一种最合理的最实际的鼓励。这种鼓励将促使作家增强劳动。对不够努力的作家们，这样也不失为一种刺激。
    解放前的一段十年以上的时期，我是以版税尤其是上演税为生活的主要收入的。解放以后我没有什么创作，但是我感觉着目前对于创作劳动的重视是显然不足的。这里我举我自己的一个例子来说：我在一九四七年曾经写了一个神话剧“嫦娥奔月”。这三年以来据我所知：上海有人把它改编成连环图画，改编为沪剧上演；青岛文联把它改编为京剧上演；北京某剧团改了名字并改编为京剧上演；辽西省文工团木偶剧队把它作为木偶剧上演。这些改编和演出的作者都换上了别人的名字，并且改动的地方也不少值得商榷之处；但是我本人是根本连通知都不曾得到的，作者理应得到的权益当然也就不必谈。
    这种情况我想不是个别的。再举一个例子，譬如现在地方戏最流行的“小女婿”。就我所知，剧中人物、背景、及大部分的内容都足以说明这是根据李健吾所作话剧“青春”改编的。但是李健吾先生的名字从来没有和“小女婿”发生丝毫的连系。
    作家的权益是应当得到保障的。这就是说文艺创作这一劳动形式应当得到它应得的重视。这可能成为改变作家生活方式的开始，也即是消除作家的
    “供给制思想”的对症之药。这样做必然还要经过一些步骤和相当的时间。但是我相信文艺创作必须在职业化之后才能得到更大的发展和进步，这将是促成我们人民文艺的创作高潮的推动的力量。
    此外应当考虑的当然还很多，譬如有一些优秀的作家长时期担负了行政责任的，把他们从行政事务的重压之下解放出来，使他们把力量转向创作，这也是应该考虑到的。文　化　简　讯
