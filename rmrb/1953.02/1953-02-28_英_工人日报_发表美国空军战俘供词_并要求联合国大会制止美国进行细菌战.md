Xinhua News Agency, Prague, February 27th: The London "Worker's Daily" announced on February 24th: "Every permanent delegation to the United Nations will receive the new evidence of American germ warfare in Korea now published by the 'Worker's Daily.'"

J.R. Campbell, editor of the "Worker's Daily," has printed many copies of the news that American senior officers, Colonel Schwable and Major Bley, admitted to American germ warfare, and distributed them to the 54 delegations of the United Nations, the Secretariat of the Security Council, the Secretariat of the General Assembly, and the British Foreign Secretary. In his accompanying letter, Campbell wrote: "Faced with the confessions of such senior American officers, the United Nations must act to stop this crime, or it will be condemned before the whole world as being equally guilty with the United States."

General Clark admitted that Colonel Schwable and Major Bley were real people, but denied the officers' accusations. The "Worker's Daily" published a commentary on this matter in its editorial on February 25th. The editorial pointed out that the American high command made a statement of "total denial" due to a guilty conscience. The editorial also said: "But to make thoughtful men and women believe that the United States has not engaged in germ warfare cannot be accomplished by General Clark's denial statement alone."

The editorial continued: "No one has ever denied that the United States possesses weapons for germ warfare. At the same time, no one has ever denied that the United States government is the only major power that has not ratified the 1925 Geneva Protocol outlawing germ warfare.

Furthermore, General Clark dares not deny that Colonel Schwable is the Chief of Staff of the 1st Marine Air Wing, and dares not deny that Major Bley is the Ordnance Officer of the 1st Marine Air Wing."

In response to Clark's weak slander of the confessions of the two senior American officers, the "Worker's Daily" said: "Anyone who reads these clear, concise confessions, which include many specific details, will immediately believe that they were spoken by seasoned senior figures who are accustomed to planning complex military operations.

The confessions present many dates, mention the names of the officers involved, state their ranks and affiliations, indicate the numbers of the relevant units, the types of some of the aircraft involved, and state the airports from which these aircraft took off.

Clark made no response or explanation at all regarding all of these facts. And these are all details that only an officer in Colonel Schwable's position—an officer serving as Chief of Staff—could master."

The editorial concluded: "The exposure of these facts about the American use of this most barbaric weapon in Korea should stir the conscience of Britain. We should loudly proclaim: The United Nations must stop the germ warfare against Korea!"

The "Worker's Daily" published records of Alan Winnington's long conversations with Colonel Schwable and Major Bley on the 23rd, 24th, and 25th, regarding the facts revealed in their confessions.

The French "l'Humanité", the Czechoslovakian "Rudé právo", the Czechoslovak Army newspaper "People's Defense", and the Hungarian "Szabad Nép" have all published Schwable's confession.

### 英“工人日报”发表美国空军战俘供词  并要求联合国大会制止美国进行细菌战

    英“工人日报”发表美国空军战俘供词
    并要求联合国大会制止美国进行细菌战
    【新华社布拉格二十七日电】伦敦“工人日报”在二月二十四日宣布：“联合国每一个永久代表团都将接到‘工人日报’现在发表的美国在朝鲜进行细菌战的新证据。”
    “工人日报”总编辑杰·鲁·坎贝尔已把美国高级军官许威布尔和布莱承认美国进行细菌战的消息印了许多份，分送给联合国五十四国代表团、安全理事会秘书处、大会秘书处和英国外交大臣。坎贝尔在他的附信中写道：“面对着这样高级的美国军官的口供，联合国必须行动起来制止这种罪行，不然它就会在全世界面前被斥为跟美国同样有罪。”
    克拉克将军承认确有许威布尔上校和布莱少校其人，但抵赖两个军官的指责，“工人日报”特在二月二十五日社论上就这件事发表评论。社论指出，美国高级指挥部由于心虚而发表“全盘矢口否认”的声明，社论又说：“但是要想使得有思想的男人和女人都相信美国没有进行细菌战，那不是克拉克将军一个否认声明就能办得到的。”
    社论又说：“美国拥有进行细菌战的武器，这一点从来没有人否认过。同时也从来没有人否认，美国政府是不曾批准一九二五年的宣布细菌战为非法的日内瓦议定书的唯一大国。
    此外，克拉克将军也不敢否认许威布尔上校是海军陆战队第一空军联队的参谋长，不敢否认布莱少校是海军陆战队第一空军联队的军械官。”
    “工人日报”在答复克拉克对美国两个高级军官供词的软弱无力的诽谤时说：“任何人读了这些明确扼要而包括许多具体细节的供词，立刻就会相信，这是一向惯于计划复杂的军事行动的干练的高级人物才能说得出来的。
    供词提出了许多日期，谈出有关军官的姓名，说出他们的官阶和隶属，说明有关部队的番号，有关的某些飞机的型式，并且说出这些飞机出动的机场。
    关于所有这一切事实，克拉克完全没有作答，也没有作任何解释。而这都是只有像许威布尔上校这样职位的军官——就是担任参谋长的军官——才能掌握的细节。”
    社论结语说：“这些关于美国在朝鲜使用这种最野蛮武器的事实的揭露，应该激起英国的良心。我们应该大声疾呼：联合国必须制止对朝鲜进行的细菌战。”
    “工人日报”在二十三日、二十四日和二十五日连续发表了阿兰·魏宁顿就许威布尔上校和布莱少校的供词所揭露的事实与他们长谈的记录。
    法国“人道报”，捷克斯洛伐克的“红色权利报”，捷克斯洛伐克陆军报纸“人民防线报”，匈牙利的“自由人民报”都发表了许威布尔的供词。
