    Mr. Chairman: At the past two sessions, the World Federation of Trade Unions, based on the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter and the aspirations of the Asian working class, has put forward opinions and suggestions on how to promote the independent economic development of Asian countries and improve the lives of workers and the broad masses of working people. Unfortunately, these reasonable opinions and suggestions, reflecting the wishes of millions of Asian workers, have not received due attention and adoption. We cannot help but feel deeply disappointed.
    In recent years, with the exception of the rapid economic development of countries such as the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the Mongolian People's Republic, and the severe economic damage suffered by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam due to foreign interventionist wars, the economic situation in other Asian countries has not only failed to improve in reality, but has instead deteriorated. The threat of production decline leading to the collapse of the entire national economy has deeply aroused concern and anxiety among all parties. Therefore, we, representing the World Federation of Trade Unions, which has over 80 million members and represents the interests of the world's working class, would like to reiterate our opinions and suggestions to this session.
    (1)
    In recent years, the economic situation in many Asian countries has further deteriorated, which is reflected in: the shrinking of industrial and agricultural production, the rapid reversal of import and export trade, the sharp decline in national income, and the serious development of war damage and natural disasters, forcing the people of various countries, especially the vast number of workers and peasants, to live in very tragic circumstances.
    From the statistical materials published by the United Nations Secretariat, it can be seen that the national income of economically backward countries, which account for nearly one-third of the world's population, is less than 5% of the total national income of all countries in the world. The average per capita income of the people in Southeast Asian countries in 1949 was only $50, and in some countries it was only $25. The income of workers is even more pitifully low. Even at such a shockingly low income level, it has continued to decline in recent years. According to official, and clearly underestimated figures, the price index of consumer goods in the Philippines in 1951 increased by 5% compared to 1949, while workers' monetary wages decreased by 7%, which means that workers' real wages decreased by another 11.5% in two years. According to the report of the American Bell Mission, the income of Filipino workers in 1949 could only maintain half of the minimum expenditure of their families. According to the conservative estimate of Mr. Ranson, the editor-in-chief of the "Philippine Rural Reconstruction Movement", the number of unemployed and semi-unemployed people in the Philippines has reached 4 million, accounting for more than one-fifth of the total population. For example, the average wage of Japanese workers, according to the statistics in September 1951, was less than 13,000 yen. However, based on the pre-war living standard, it would take 25,000 yen to maintain a family now. At present, the number of unemployed and semi-unemployed people in Japan exceeds 10 million. These are just typical examples, and similar situations are common in Southeast Asian countries.
    Foreign monopoly capitalists are using the existence of a vast reserve army of the unemployed to intensify the cruel exploitation of the working class in order to extract maximum profits and gather cheap cannon fodder. Workers' labor intensity is being strengthened without limit, occupational accidents are constantly occurring, workers' legitimate rights are being deprived, various anti-labor bills are being formulated one after another, and workers' reasonable struggles are being suppressed with weapons. The various freedoms and human rights stipulated in the United Nations Charter have long been abandoned and trampled upon.
    (2)
    However, many Asian countries possess abundant natural resources and a large labor force, and yet their people are in such a tragic, impoverished, and hungry situation. What is the reason?
    It must be admitted that it is only because foreign governments control the major economic lifelines of these Asian countries and are constantly strengthening their control over their entire economic, political, and social lives. Therefore, after the Second World War, the economies of these Asian countries have failed to embark on the path of independent development and industrialization as the broad masses of people had hoped.
    In recent years, in order to expand its arms race, the United States government has increasingly strengthened its plunder of various raw materials from economically backward countries. It uses its monopoly capital to control the world market, buying raw materials at the lowest prices and selling its surplus products at the highest prices. On the one hand, it uses threats and coercive methods such as stopping purchases, lowering prices, and using substitutes to deal with countries in Southeast Asia that produce raw materials, forcing these countries to export their products at low prices so that American monopoly capitalists can obtain maximum profits. On the other hand, it threatens to stop "US aid" and exerts various pressures to force these countries to sever normal trade relations with the people's democratic countries. The United States manipulates the "United Nations General Assembly" to impose illegal "embargoes" on these countries. The result of the "embargo" is that the production of Southeast Asian countries has further shrunk and national trade has sharply decreased. According to the economic report published by the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East, the world's (mainly Southeast Asia) natural rubber production in 1952 decreased by 200,000 tons compared to 1951. The total exports of individual countries in Asia and the Far East in the first half of 1952 decreased by 26% compared to the first half of 1951. The total exports of Malaya in the first half of 1952 decreased by 41% compared to the first half of 1951, and the trade balance quickly reversed from a surplus of 980 million Straits dollars to a deficit of 32 million Straits dollars. In Singapore alone, seven of the thirteen large rubber factories were forced to shut down, leaving 8,000 workers unemployed. According to the data from the Indonesian Central Bureau of Statistics, Indonesia's imports exceeded exports by more than 1.36 billion rupiahs from January to October 1952, while in the same period in 1951, there was a surplus of more than 1.0077 billion rupiahs. This not only caused the country to lose a large amount of foreign exchange and fiscal revenue, but also caused rubber factories to close down, rubber farmers to go bankrupt, and the number of unemployed to increase sharply. Thailand's treasury revenue has been greatly reduced due to the low price restrictions of the "international market" under the "rubber purchase agreement" signed with the United States, and 80% of the rubber plantations have stopped tapping. In the summer of last year, more than 90% of the southern rubber factories stopped working, and the number of unemployed rubber workers reached 30,000, accounting for 40% of the total number of rubber workers. These facts fully illustrate the deep disasters that the US "blockade" and "embargo" policies have brought to the people of Southeast Asian countries, but American monopoly capitalists have seized unparalleled huge profits from them. The price of tin was lowered ten times between April and August 1951 alone. The US Senate Tin Subcommittee admitted that American monopoly capitalists made an additional profit of $500 million in four months just due to the fall in tin prices. "Deep disasters" and "unparalleled huge profits" demonstrate the essence of the "blockade" and "embargo" policies. There is no doubt that the "blockade" and "embargo" are important reasons that directly contribute to the further deterioration of the economic situation in many Asian countries today.
    As for those "economic aids" of the United States in the name of "helping the development of backward regions in Asia and the Far East," such as the general agreement under Truman's "Point Four Program" and the bilateral agreements in the style of the "Asian Marshall Plan," even American officials and prominent American political commentators now believe that this is an American diplomatic and political weapon. All countries that accept "US aid" know very well the huge price they are forced to pay! Not only is the economic lifeline of the entire country gradually falling into the hands of the US government, and the country's internal affairs are being interfered with, but the United States is also seizing military bases in these countries and building a large number of airports, strategic highways, and other military facilities. This seriously endangers the sovereignty and independence of various countries.
    Let us take a closer look at the truth of "aid"! The United States has seized 73% of its imported strategic materials and other materials lacking in the United States from economically backward regions. And they "absorb" 44% of the total US exports. Among these American goods exported to backward countries, the total amount of inferior cotton yarn, cigarettes, and other consumer goods accounts for more than 82% of the total US exports. In 1951, 70% of US cigarette exports were to economically backward countries. The Philippines, the world-renowned origin of Luzon tobacco, is now forced to import large quantities of American cigarettes and tobacco. Indonesia, a major tobacco-producing country, was also forced to import $8 million worth of American cigarettes and tobacco in 1951, but the American machinery and tools imported into Indonesia in the same year were only worth $200,000. India imported $463 million worth of goods from the United States in 1951, of which machinery for manufacturing metals was only worth $500,000, that is, only one-thousandth. These "aids" will only make economically backward countries permanently subordinate to the United States as suppliers of raw materials and markets for export products. Truman made it very clear, "Point Four is a good deal for us (referring to the United States)...means more trade, more markets...and more raw material supplies." Of course, it also means more profits. American foreign economic policy experts Auden and Philip admit that the "development" mentioned in the official statements of American policymakers is limited to improving agricultural technology and expanding the mining industry. The American definition of "development" never includes moving towards economic independence on the basis of comprehensive industrial development.
    However, American monopoly capitalists are not satisfied with this. In implementing the policy of "American capital, Japanese industry, and Southeast Asian agriculture," they are using the so-called "US-Japan Economic Cooperation Plan" to further exploit and enslave the people of Southeast Asian countries. Under the active support of the US government, the Japanese Yoshida government formulated the "Five-Year Plan for the Development of Southeast Asia" in 1952, intending to relive its old dream of the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere." Japanese zaibatsu, acting as pawns of American monopoly capital, are starting to prepare for war and re-infiltrating many economic sectors in Southeast Asian countries. The textile industry crisis in India, Indonesia, Thailand, Burma, and other countries last year was precisely promoted by this American policy. More seriously, the US government unscrupulously turned Japan into a colony and militarized Japan as a general base for the US to carry out aggressive wars in the Far East. At present, due to the setbacks on the Korean battlefield, the US government is actively preparing to expand its aggressive war in Asia on the one hand, and is conspiring to drive "Asians to fight Asians" on the other hand. The newly appointed US President Eisenhower openly called for this. This cannot but arouse strong opposition from the people of the Far East countries who suffered from the Japanese militarist looting not long ago. The US war preparations policy and the criminal act of re-militarizing Japan have seriously harmed peace in Asia and the world and threaten the development of peaceful economies in various countries.
    (3)
    However, in some Asian countries, thanks to the efforts of the people themselves and the utilization of their own resources, and thanks to the establishment of normal economic and trade relations with peaceful and democratic countries, their industrial and agricultural production is constantly improving, people's lives are rapidly improving, and the entire socio-economy is moving forward along the path of independent and comprehensive development.
    As everyone knows, the Asian parts of the Soviet Union did not have modern industry during the Tsarist era, and even the simplest agricultural machinery was lacking in agriculture. Before the revolution, the people there lived in slavery with hunger, poverty, and no political rights for a long time. However, since the October Socialist Revolution, after more than 30 years of socialist construction, the situation is completely different. For example, in the five republics of Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, and Tajikistan, the output of large-scale industries increased 22 times between 1928 and 1951. The current power generation in these republics is three times the total power generation of the six countries of Turkey, Iran, Pakistan, Egypt, Afghanistan, and Syria. Agricultural machinery equipment has exceeded that of the most developed capitalist countries in Europe. Taking the supply of tractors as an example, the Republic of Uzbekistan has an average of 14 tractors per 1,000 hectares of cultivated land, while France only has 7 and Italy only has 4. The material and cultural life of the people has been greatly improved. At present, in the Republic of Uzbekistan, there is an average of one doctor for every 895 people, while even in a highly industrialized capitalist country like France, there is only one doctor for every 1,000 people. Every year, tens of thousands of working people in these republics take vacations in well-equipped sanatoriums and convalescent homes.
    What has surprised the people of the world is that the Chinese people, after establishing the People's Republic of China, have achieved brilliant achievements in the development of the national economy in just three years, and have begun a large-scale five-year economic construction plan this year.
    In the past three years, China's grain output has increased by 46%, cotton output has increased by 202%, and the entire agricultural output has exceeded the highest level in previous years. The total value of industrial production has more than doubled in three years, accounting for nearly 30% of the total national output value. Thousands of industrial products that used to rely on imports are now manufactured by ourselves. On the basis of rapid production development, the lives of the Chinese people have improved unprecedentedly. After implementing land reform and eliminating the feudal system, Chinese peasants have their own land. In addition, with the implementation of large-scale water conservancy and irrigation projects across the country, agricultural production has greatly developed, and their lives have gradually become prosperous. In 1951, the national agricultural surplus was estimated to be more than 800 million US dollars. In many places, the purchasing power of farmers increased by more than 50% in 1951 compared with 1950, and the purchasing power of the people across the country increased by about 25% in 1951 compared with 1950. In the past three years, the real wages of Chinese workers have increased by 60% to 120%, and various social welfare benefits are constantly improving. Labor insurance has been implemented in most factories, mines, and transportation enterprises. New workers' residences are being built in large numbers across the country. The cultural life and health care of the workers and peasants have also greatly developed. The material and cultural life of the Chinese people will undoubtedly be further improved with the development of large-scale economic construction.
    The rapid development of industrial and agricultural production in China and the continuous increase in domestic people's purchasing power have opened up broad avenues for international trade.
    Trade between China and the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries is entirely based on peace and friendship, equality and mutual benefit, and respect for each other. The Soviet Union has supplied China with a large amount of industrial equipment, which has greatly helped China's economic construction. The materials exported by China are also conducive to improving the lives of the Soviet people. This equal and mutually beneficial trade is developing rapidly between China and the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries.
    The Chinese people have a long history of trade with the Japanese people and the people of Southeast Asian countries, and there are currently all the convenient conditions for developing equal and mutually beneficial trade relations. Before the war, the total value of Sino-Japanese trade reached 340 million US dollars annually. However, due to the US control of Japan's economy and the implementation of illegal "blockades" and "embargoes" against China, trade between the Chinese and Japanese people has been greatly hindered and is almost at a standstill. After the International Economic Conference held in Moscow in the spring of 1952, representatives of the Japanese economic community broke through many difficulties and signed a trade agreement with the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade. This fully reflects the Japanese people's ardent desire to develop a peaceful economy and restore free trade. However, the US government is stepping up its interference to obstruct the realization of this wish of the Japanese people. At the end of 1952, the People's Republic of China and Ceylon signed a general trade agreement and a five-year trade agreement on the purchase and sale of rubber and rice in Beijing, which are typical examples of equal and mutually beneficial trade. This has been powerfully demonstrated by the remarks of Mr. Shen Nanaike, Minister of Commerce and Trade of Ceylon, and the opinions of newspapers. He believes that the agreement guarantees a large sales market for Ceylon's rubber, enabling Ceylon to benefit by 68 million rupees annually in terms of price. Secondly, there is a guarantee of importing rice from China with a quality better than any market, and at a price of 56 pounds per ton (the price according to the final agreement is 54 pounds), Ceylon will profit by 24 million rupees a year. In this way, the purchasing power of Ceylon's rubber has increased. At the same time, these agreements are also beneficial to China's economy. The peaceful, friendly, equal, and mutually beneficial nature of the Sino-Ceylon trade agreement stands in stark contrast to the plundering and enslaving nature of the US "bilateral agreements." These agreements have shown the real way out for the people of Southeast Asian countries who are suffering from economic deterioration due to the impact of the US "blockade" and "embargo."
    (4)
    The Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East should face up to the above-mentioned two completely opposite trends in Asia's economic development, and should take concrete steps to realize the principles stipulated in the United Nations Charter and the purposes of the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East. It should effectively "promote the economic recovery of Asia and the Far East" and "raise the level of economic life in Asia and the Far East." In order to achieve the above-mentioned goals, we believe that this session should adopt the following recommendations:
    1.  Demand the immediate cessation of the existing war in the Far East, so that the peaceful economy of Asian countries can develop normally, and that the people of various countries can live in a peaceful environment. Condemn the US government's war preparation economic policy, as well as all economic aggression against Asian and Far Eastern countries under the name of "aid."
    2.  Oppose "blockades" and "embargoes" that violate the principles of the United Nations Charter, abolish all artificial obstacles to international trade, advocate the signing of various trade agreements under the principle of equality and mutual benefit, and develop normal trade relations between countries, so as to improve the living standards of the people of Asian and Far Eastern countries.
    3.  Recommend to the United Nations that it require the governments of Asian and Far Eastern countries to effectively guarantee the various freedoms and rights of the people and trade unions, increase wages, conscientiously implement social insurance and unemployment relief, and take effective measures to improve the living conditions of workers in various countries. Organize a special committee with representatives from the World Federation of Trade Unions to conduct an impartial investigation into the increasingly deteriorating economic situation and the living conditions of workers in many Asian countries, and instruct the committee to submit its investigation report to the next session of the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East.

### 世界工会联合会代表团致联合国亚洲暨远东经济委员会第九届会议的备忘录

    世界工会联合会代表团致联合国亚洲暨远东经济委员会第九届会议的备忘录
    主席先生：在上两届会议上世界工会联合会曾根据联合国宪章的宗旨和原则及亚洲工人阶级的愿望，提出如何促进亚洲国家经济的独立发展和改善工人及广大劳动人民的生活的意见和建议，然而不幸的是，这些反映着亚洲千百万工人愿望的合理意见和建议并没有受到应有的重视和采纳，我们对此不能不感到十分遗憾。
    近年来，除了苏联、中华人民共和国、蒙古人民共和国等国家经济都有突飞猛进的发展，以及朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和越南民主共和国在外国侵略者的干涉战争中，经济受着极大的破坏以外，亚洲其他国家的经济情况不仅没有实际改善，相反的更加恶化了。生产衰退以致使整个国民经济趋于瓦解的威胁，深深地引起各方人士的关怀和忧虑。因此，我们代表拥有八千余万会员并代表世界工人阶级利益的世界工会联合会，愿向本届会议再度提出我们的意见和建议。
    （一）
    近年来亚洲许多国家的经济情况更趋恶化，这表现在：工农业生产萎缩，进出口贸易迅速逆转，国民收入锐减，加以战争的破坏和灾荒的严重发展，迫使各国人民特别是广大的工人和农民，生活在十分悲惨的境遇中。
    从联合国秘书处发表的统计材料可以看出：几乎占世界人口三分之一的经济落后国家的国民收入，其总数还不到全世界各国国民总收入的百分之五。东南亚各国人民一九四九年的每人平均收入只有五十美元，在有些国家只达二十五美元。至于工人的收入更低得可怜。就是这样低得惊人的收入水平，近年仍继续下降中。根据官方显然低估的数字，一九五一年菲律宾消费品的价格指数比一九四九年增加百分之五，而工人货币工资却减少百分之七，也就是说工人实际工资在两年中又降低了百分之十一点五。一九四九年菲律宾工人的收入，即按美国贝尔调查团的报告，也只能维持其家庭最低限度支出的一半。根据“菲律宾乡村建设运动”编辑主任兰逊先生保守的估计，菲律宾失业和半失业人数已达四百万人，占全人口的五分之一以上。又如日本工人的平均工资，据一九五一年九月的统计还不到一万三千日元。但以战前生活水平为标准，那么目前要维持一个家庭就要两万五千元。目前在日本失业和半失业的人数已超过一千万。这只不过是些典型的例子，类似的情况在东南亚各国是普遍存在着的。
    外国垄断资本家们正利用广大失业后备军的存在，加强对工人阶级的残酷剥削，以榨取最高利润，并搜罗廉价炮灰。工人劳动强度被无限制地加强着，职业事故不断发生，工人的合法权利被剥夺，接连制订各种反劳工法案，用武器镇压工人的合理斗争。联合国宪章所规定的各项自由和人权，早被弃置和践踏。
    （二）
    然而，许多亚洲国家都拥有丰富的天然资源和大量人力，而其人民竟处在这样悲惨、贫困和饥饿的境地，其原因是什么呢？
    毋庸讳言，只是由于外国政府控制了这些亚洲国家的主要经济命脉，且不断加强控制着它们的整个经济、政治和社会生活，因而，在第二次世界大战结束后，这些亚洲国家的经济并未能如广大人民的愿望，走上独立发展和工业化的道路。
    近年来美国政府为了扩军备战，日益加强其对经济落后国家的各种原料的掠夺：它利用它的垄断资本控制世界市场，以最低价格买进原料，以最高价格卖出它的剩余产品，它一方面以停购、压低价格、利用代用品等等恫吓和强制的办法来对付东南亚出产原料的各国，迫使这些国家不得不低价输出其产品，以使美国垄断资本家获得最大限度的利润；另一方面又以停止“美援”作要挟，并施行各种压力，来迫使这些国家割断和人民民主国家之间的正常贸易关系。美国操纵“联合国大会”把非法的“禁运”强加在这些国家身上。“禁运”的结果使东南亚国家的生产更加萎缩，国家贸易锐减。根据联合国亚洲暨远东经济委员会所发表的经济报告，一九五二年全世界（主要是东南亚）天然胶的产量较一九五一年减少二十万吨，亚洲及远东地区的个别国家在一九五二年上半年的输出总额较一九五一年上半年减少百分之二十六，马来亚一九五二年上半年的输出总额较一九五一年上半年减少百分之四十一，从出超九亿八千万元叻币迅速逆转为入超三千二百万元叻币，仅新加坡一地十三家大胶厂，即有七家被迫停工，使八千工人陷于失业。根据印尼中央统计局材料，印尼一九五二年一至十月入超达十三亿六千余万盾，而在一九五一年同时期尚出超十亿零七千七百万盾，不仅使国家丧失大量外汇和财政收入，且使胶厂倒闭，胶农破产，失业人数骤增。泰国因受和美国签订的“购胶协定”的“国际市场”低价限制，国库收入大减，胶园百分之八十停割。在去年夏季南部胶厂百分之九十以上停工，失业橡胶工人达三万人，占胶工总人数的百分之四十。这些事实充分说明了：美国的“封锁”、“禁运”政策，已给东南亚各国人民带来了多么深重的灾难，但美国垄断资本家却从其中攫取了无比的巨额利润。只在一九五一年四月至八月间锡价便被压低十次。美国参议院锡小组委员会承认，仅由于锡的跌价，美国垄断资本家在四个月内多获得五亿美元的利润。“深重的灾难”和“无比的巨额利润”，就表现出“封锁”“禁运”政策的实质。毫无疑问，“封锁”“禁运”就是直接造成当前许多亚洲国家经济情况更加恶化的重要原因。
    至于美国那些以“帮助亚洲及远东落后地区开发”为名的“经济援助”，如杜鲁门“第四点计划”下的一般协定以及“亚洲马歇尔计划”式的双边协定等，现在连美国的官员和美国著名政治评论家都认为这是一种美国外交武器和政治武器。一切接受“美援”的国家都十分清楚地知道，他们是被迫付出了多么巨大的代价啊！不仅使整个国家的经济命脉逐步落在美国政府手中，国家内政受到干涉，而且美国还在这些国家里攫取军事基地，大量修筑机场、战略公路及其他军事设备。这就严重地危害着各国的主权与独立。
    让我们仔细看一看“援助”的真相吧！美国从经济落后各地区攫取了其入口战略物资及其他美国所缺乏的物资的百分之七十三。而它们“吸收”着美国出口总额的百分之四十四。在这些输出到落后国家的美国货中，劣质棉纱品、香烟及其他消费品的总量占美国输出总额的百分之八十二以上。一九五一年美国出口香烟的百分之七十是输至那些经济落后的国家的。世界驰名的吕宋烟产地菲律宾，今天正被迫输入大量的美国香烟和烟草。大量出产烟草的印尼，一九五一年也被迫输入了价格达八百万美元的美国香烟和烟草，可是同年输入印尼的美国机器和工具只值二十万美元。印度在一九五一年由美国输入的价值四亿六千三百万美元的货物中，制造金属用的机器只值五十万美元，这就是说，只有千分之一。这些“援助”只会使经济落后的国家永远成为附属于美国的原料供应地和输出产品的市场。杜鲁门说得很明白，“第四点计划对我们（指美国）是很好的买卖……意味着更多的贸易，更多的市场……及更多的原料供应”。当然也意味着更多的利润。美国对外经济政策专家奥登与菲利普承认：美国政策制定人的正式声明中所提到的“发展”只限于改进农业技术和扩充采矿工业，美国对
    “发展”所下的定义总不包括在工业全面发展的基础上走向经济独立。
    然而美国垄断资本家并不以此为满足。他们在执行“资本美国工业日本农业东南亚”政策下，用所谓“美日经济合作计划”进一步剥削与奴役东南亚各国人民。在美国政府积极扶助下，一九五二年日本吉田政府制订了“开发东南亚五年计划”，打算重温其“大东亚共荣圈”的旧梦。日本财阀充当美国垄断资本的走卒开始备战，重新渗入东南亚各国的许多经济部门。去年印度、印尼、泰国、缅甸等国的纺织业危机，正是美国这种政策所促成的。更加严重的是，美国政府肆无忌惮地把日本沦为殖民地，并使日本军国主义化，作为美国在远东进行侵略战争的总基地。目前，由于朝鲜战场上的挫败，美国政府正在一面积极准备在亚洲扩大侵略战争，另一面又在阴谋驱使“亚洲人打亚洲人”。刚刚上台的美国总统艾森豪威尔就公然如此号召。这就不能不引起不久以前曾遭受日本军国主义洗劫的远东各国人民的强烈反对。美国的备战政策和重新把日本军国主义化的罪恶行为已经严重地危害了亚洲和世界的和平，并威胁了各国和平经济的发展。
    （三）
    但是，在有些亚洲国家内，由于人民自己的努力和利用了自己的资源，由于他们与和平民主国家之间建立了正常的经济与贸易关系，他们的工农业生产正在不断提高，人民生活正在迅速改善，整个社会经济正在沿着独立和全面发展的道路迈步前进。
    大家知道，苏联亚洲部分各共和国以前在沙皇时代没有近代工业，在农业方面甚至连最简单的农业机器也没有。那里的人民在革命前长期处于饥饿贫困和毫无政治权利的奴隶生活状态。但十月社会主义革命以来，三十几年的社会主义建设后，情况完全不同了。如乌兹别克、哈萨克、吉尔吉斯、土库曼和塔吉克五个共和国中，大规模工业的产量一九二八年到一九五一年之间已增加二十二倍。这些共和国目前的电力产量相当于土耳其、伊朗、巴基斯坦、埃及、阿富汗和叙利亚六个国家电力总产量的三倍。农业机械装备已超过欧洲最发达的资本主义国家。以拖拉机的供应为例，乌兹别克共和国平均一千公顷耕地面积就有十四台拖拉机，而法国只有七台，意大利只有四台。人民物质和文化生活已大大提高，目前在乌兹别克共和国，每八百九十五人平均就有一个医生，而甚至在法国这样高度工业化的资本主义国家也不过每一千人才有一个医生。每年这些共和国都有成千成万的劳动人民在设备优良的疗养院和休养所休假。
    使全世界人民感到惊讶的是，中国人民在建立了中华人民共和国以后，在短短三年中，国民经济的发展获得辉煌的成就，今年已经开始大规模的五年经济建设计划。
    三年来中国的粮食产量增加了百分之四十六，棉花产量增加了百分之二百零二，整个农业生产量已超过以往年代的最高水平。工业生产总值三年中已增加一倍多，在全国生产总值中已占将近百分之三十。上千种过去一贯依靠输入的工业品，现在已由自己制造。在生产迅速发展的基础上，中国人民的生活已空前的改善了。中国农民在实施了土地改革，消灭了封建制度以后，有了自己的土地，再加上全国巨大规模水利灌溉工程的进行，农业生产大大发展，其生活已逐渐富裕起来，一九五一年全国农业余款估计在八亿美元以上，许多地方的农民购买力在一九五一年比一九五○年提高了百分之五十以上，全国人民的购买力在一九五一年比一九五○年提高了百分之二十五左右。中国工人实际工资三年来增加百分之六十至一百二十，各种社会福利正在不断增进。绝大部分的工厂、矿山和交通企业已实行劳动保险。工人的新住宅各地正在大量修建。工农大众的文化生活、卫生保健工作均有很大发展。中国人民的物质与文化生活，无疑地将随着大规模的经济建设发展而更加提高。
    中国工农业生产的迅速发展和国内人民购买力的不断提高，为国际贸易开辟了广阔的道路。
    中国和苏联及人民民主国家之间的贸易，是完全建筑在和平友好、平等互利、尊重对方的基础上面的。苏联曾供给中国以大量工业设备，对中国的经济建设有极大帮助。中国输出的物资也有利于改进苏联人民的生活。这种平等互利的贸易正在中国和苏联及各人民民主国家之间迅速发展着。
    中国人民和日本人民及东南亚各国人民间有悠久的贸易历史，目前也存在着发展平等互利贸易关系的一切便利条件。战前中日贸易总值曾年达三亿四千万美元。可是由于美国控制了日本的经济，并对中国实施非法的“封锁”“禁运”，中日人民之间的贸易就受到极大障碍，几乎等于停顿。一九五二年春在莫斯科召开国际经济会议后，日本经济界代表冲破重重困难和中国国际贸易促进委员会订立了贸易协定。这充分反映了日本人民发展和平经济和恢复自由贸易的热烈愿望。但美国政府正在加紧干涉以阻挠日本人民这一愿望的实现。一九五二年年底，中华人民共和国和锡兰在北京先后签订的一般贸易协定和关于买卖橡胶大米五年贸易协定，是平等互利贸易的一个典型范例。锡兰商务贸易部部长沈纳那亚克的谈话和报纸舆论都有力地证明了这一点。他认为：协定保证了锡兰橡胶有一广大销售市场，使锡兰在价格上每年获益六千八百万卢比。其次有保证从中国进口品质比任何市场都好的大米，其价格每吨五十六英镑（按最后协定的价格为五十四英镑）使锡兰一年获利二千四百万卢比。这样锡兰橡胶的购买力提高了，同时，这些协定对中国的经济也是有益的。中锡贸易协定的和平友好与平等互利的性质和美国“双边协定”的掠夺奴役的性质适成一个鲜明的对照。这些协定已为正受美国“封锁”“禁运”的影响而遭遇经济恶化的痛苦的东南亚各国人民显示了真正的出路。

    亚洲暨远东经济委员会应该正视以上所述的亚洲经济发展中的两种截然相反的趋势，应该采取具体步骤以实现联合国宪章所规定的原则和亚洲暨远东经济委员会的宗旨，应该有效地“促进亚洲及远东之经济复兴”及“提高亚洲及远东之经济生活水平”。为了达到上述目的，我们认为本届会议应该通过如下建议：
    一、要求立即停止在远东的现有战争，使亚洲各国的和平经济得以正常发展，使各国人民能够在和平的环境中生活。谴责美国政府的备战经济政策，以及在“援助”名义下对亚洲及远东各国进行的一切经济侵略行为。
    二、反对违反联合国宪章原则的“封锁”和“禁运”，取消一切人为的国际贸易障碍，提倡在平等互利原则下签订各种贸易协定，发展各国间正常的贸易关系，以提高亚洲及远东各国人民的生活水平。
    三、向联合国建议，要求亚洲及远东各国政府切实保障人民和工会各项自由权利，增加工资，认真实施社会保险与失业救济，并采取有效办法改善各国工人的生活情况。组织有世界工会联合会代表参加的专门委员会，对日益恶化的许多亚洲国家的经济情况和工人生活情况进行公正的调查，并责成该委员会在明年度的亚洲暨远东经济委员会会议上提出它的调查报告书。        （新华社）
