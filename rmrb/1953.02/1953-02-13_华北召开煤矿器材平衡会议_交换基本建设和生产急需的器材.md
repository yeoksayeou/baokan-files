The North China Coal Mine Bureau held a coal mine equipment balancing conference at the end of January, exchanging urgently needed coal mine equipment worth over 5 billion yuan.

Due to a lack of planning in production management in the past, the various mining bureaus in North China have had a large amount of stagnant and over-stocked equipment for many years, accumulating a large amount of capital. On the other hand, the bureaus have not been able to purchase certain equipment in a timely manner, affecting the completion of basic construction and production tasks. These problems were largely resolved through this balancing conference. For example, the 12 tons of 1.5-inch iron plates transferred from the Datong Mining Bureau and the 18 tons of angle iron transferred from the Yangquan Mining Bureau solved the urgent need for drilling rig materials for basic construction in various mines. In addition, kerosene, paraffin wax, drill bits, etc., were also exchanged with each other.

This equipment balancing conference followed the principle of internal before external, and basic construction before production. The bureaus filled out equipment transfer-out and transfer-in cards, distinguished between priorities, and then compared them with each other to apply for exchange. In the exchange, if a certain material was needed by all mines, the above principles were also followed to distinguish between primary and secondary needs, make decisions, and then sign agreements for adjustment. This not only ensured the timely supply of equipment, but also handled a portion of the stagnant or over-stocked equipment, saving a large amount of capital for the country. The balancing conference not only solved the timely supply of equipment and accelerated the turnover of funds for the various mining bureaus, but also enabled management cadres to establish an overall concept, laying a good foundation for future balancing work.

However, this conference was not well prepared, and the various mining bureaus did not thoroughly check the equipment in their warehouses. The exchange plan was also not thorough. During the comparison of the cards, it was often found that the equipment they wanted to transfer out was the same equipment that the bureau planned to transfer in. For example, part of the equipment that the Jingxing Mining Bureau prepared to transfer out was found to be the equipment it needed in the transfer-in plan, and had to temporarily declare that it would not be transferred. On the other hand, there are still a lot of equipment in the warehouses of the various bureaus that are not needed by the coal industry but are urgently needed by other industries. These equipments were not properly handled at this conference.

    华北召开煤矿器材平衡会议
    交换基本建设和生产急需的器材
    华北煤矿管理局在一月底召开煤矿器材平衡会议，交换了相互急需的煤矿器材价值达五十余亿元。
    华北各矿务局由于过去在生产管理上缺乏计划性，以至多年来一方面各局呆滞及超贮器材很多，积压大批资金；另一方面各局又因需要某种器材而不能及时买到，影响了基本建设与生产任务的完成。通过这次平衡会议，这些问题大都得到解决。如大同矿务局调出的十二吨一分半铁板及阳泉矿务局调出的十八吨三角铁，解决了各矿基本建设迫切需要的钻探架材料。此外，还有些煤油、石腊、钻头等，也都互相进行了交换。
    这次器材平衡会议是本着先内部后外部、先基本建设后生产的原则，分别轻重缓急，由各局填写调出调入器材卡片，再互相对照，声请交换。在交换中，如果遇到一种物资为各矿都需要的，也本着上述原则分清主次，做出决定，然后订立协议书，进行调剂。这样，既保证了器材的及时供应，又处理了一部分呆滞或超贮器材，为国家节约大批资金。平衡会议不仅解决了器材的及时供应，加速了各矿务局资金的周转，而且使管理干部树立了整体观念，为今后的平衡工作打下了良好基础。
    但是这次会议由于准备不够，各矿务局对自己仓库的器材，没有进行彻底的清查。交换计划也不周密，在对照卡片中，常发现自己所要调出的器材，正是本局计划调入的。如井陉矿务局准备调出的一部分器材，在调入计划中却发现正是自己所需要的器材，只得临时声明不调。另一方面，各局仓库中还存有不少煤业不需要而为其他行业所急需的器材。这些器材，这次会议都没有进行适当的处理。
