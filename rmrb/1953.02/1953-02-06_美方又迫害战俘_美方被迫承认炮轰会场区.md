Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 5th—The U.S. side is creating new excuses to persecute our captured personnel. According to the U.S. announcement, on the morning of the 2nd, in the Pusan U.S. POW camp hospital, eight sick POWs were imprisoned for "attacking" two American soldiers "with sticks." The U.S. communique stated that these two American soldiers "entered the tuberculosis ward of the POW camp hospital to send a POW to the X-ray room," and they were "attacked" in this ward. The U.S. side's excuse for persecuting sick and wounded POWs is extremely ridiculous. People want to ask: Why didn't the U.S. send nurses from the hospital, but instead sent American soldiers to send POWs with tuberculosis to the X-ray room? It is quite obvious that the fact hidden behind this shameless excuse is that the American aggressors are inhumanly persecuting sick POWs, either using them as subjects for heinous experiments or forcing them to accept the fate of being detained.

The U.S. side also revealed that on February 1st, another of our POWs was murdered on Jeju Island under the guise of "hanging himself."

Prior to this, the U.S. side announced on January 30th that an American soldier on Geoje Island was beaten to death by a POW "while cleaning the barracks before checking the number of people," and therefore three POWs were detained. However, the U.S. side "temporarily did not announce" the name of this American soldier.

The U.S. fabrication of such lies about POWs "attacking" American soldiers is obviously an attempt to cooperate with the U.S.'s recently published absurd "intelligence report" and create excuses for continuing to massacre POWs. The U.S.'s recent atrocities in POW camps show that as Eisenhower publicly announced that he would use the Syngman Rhee's puppet troops and the Kuomintang bandits to expand the war, the U.S. has further intensified its activities to force POWs to serve as cannon fodder.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 4th—At the liaison officers meeting of both sides of the Korean armistice negotiations on February 4th, the U.S. side admitted the incident of the U.S. shelling of the Panmunjom conference area on January 23rd, in which shells exploded near the conference tent, and expressed regret. However, on the other hand, the U.S. stubbornly insisted that such incidents were caused by our positions near the conference area, attempting to use this ridiculous excuse, which has nothing to do with the conference area agreement, to deny its responsibility for violating the agreement. Our chief liaison officer solemnly pointed out that countless facts have proven the other side's continuous violation of the agreement and sabotage of the conference area, and the other side had to admit the fact that the other side shelled the conference area on January 23rd. The other side's new absurd excuse is obviously to further systematically and thoroughly destroy the various administrative agreements of the armistice negotiations. But no matter what excuse, it cannot shirk the other side's responsibility for violating and destroying the agreement.

### 美方又迫害战俘  美方被迫承认炮轰会场区

    美方又迫害战俘
    美方被迫承认炮轰会场区
    【新华社开城五日电】美方又制造新的借口迫害我方被俘人员。据美方宣布，二日早晨，在釜山美方战俘营医院中，有八名患病的我方被俘人员因为“用棍子”“攻击”两名美国士兵而被监禁。美方的公报说，这两名美国士兵“进入战俘营医院的肺结核病房中，要把一名战俘送到X光室去”，他们就是在这个病房中受到“攻击”的。美方这种迫害伤病战俘的借口是制造得极端可笑的。人们要问：美方为什么不派医院中的护士，而要派美国士兵来把患肺结核的战俘送到X光室去呢？十分明显，掩藏在这种无耻借口后面的事实，就是美国侵略者正在惨无人道地迫害生病的战俘，不是拿他们作为罪恶的实验的对象，就是强迫他们接受被扣留的命运。
    美方同时透露，二月一日在济州岛上又有一名我方被俘人员在“上吊自杀”的借口下被杀害。
    在此以前，美方在一月三十日曾经宣布说，在巨济岛上有一名美国士兵“在检查人数以前打扫营房时”被战俘打死，因此有三名战俘被扣。但是美方对这个美国士兵的姓名却“暂不宣布”。
    美方捏造这种战俘“攻击”美国士兵的谎话，显然是企图配合美方最近发表的荒谬的“情报报告”，为继续屠杀战俘制造借口。美方最近在战俘营中的暴行，说明随着艾森豪威尔公开宣布要用李承晚伪军和国民党匪帮来扩大战争，美方已经进一步加紧了强迫战俘充当炮灰的活动。
    【新华社开城四日电】二月四日朝鲜停战谈判双方联络官会议上，美方承认一月二十三日美方炮击板门店会场区，炮弹在会场帐幕附近爆炸的事件，并表示遗憾。但另一方面美方硬说此类事件是由于会场附近有我方阵地而招致的，企图借这种与会场区协议毫无关系的荒谬借口抵赖其违反协议的责任。我方首席联络官严正指出对方不断违反协议，破坏会场区的行为已经为无数事实所证明，对方也不得不承认一月二十三日对方炮击会场区的事实。对方新的荒谬藉口显然是为了要进一步有计划地彻底破坏停战谈判的各项行政协议。但无论任何藉口都不能推脱对方违反与破坏协议的责任。
