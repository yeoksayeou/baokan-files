    The Korean Sky
    By Our Special Correspondent Yang Shuo

    One day, I went to an anti-aircraft gun command post located in a large cave on a mountain top. In the evening, when I came out of the command post and went down the mountain, I was really surprised. Below the mountain, there were several places with lights flickering, without any air defense. I thought to myself: Isn't this a joke?

    A commander smiled and said, "It's a bit careless. But it doesn't matter, the enemy planes don't dare to come. If they come, we'll shoot them down for sure."

    This reminded me of many things. I remembered how rampant the enemy planes were when the Chinese People's Volunteers first crossed the Yalu River in the winter of 1950. They flew close to the mountain tops, as if walking on a flat road, their wings sometimes touching the telephone poles; when they flew overhead, they suddenly brought a gust of wind, and the snow on the ground was fanned up, covering people in a layer of snow. But what about now?

    Look at it now. At night, as soon as the bandits show their faces, a string of red fireballs spurt from the ground, like fireworks, or like fountains, densely covering the sky over North Korea, and even birds can't break through this fire net. During the day, you can see enemy planes hit by anti-aircraft fire with black smoke coming from their tails, tumbling around drunkenly, falling all the way from mid-air. If the pilots jump out with parachutes, the ground troops will be busy capturing prisoners.

    Once, our anti-aircraft artillery captured an enemy air force officer. That officer understood the ritual of surrender very well. He first raised his hands to surrender his gun, honestly put on his broken hat to let you take pictures, and then considered his words and asked: "There are a few things I don't understand. Your troops don't earn money, how can the morale be so high? How can the Chinese and Koreans be so close? I also didn't expect you to shoot so accurately."

    If we weren't accurate, we would have shot you down right away. It is indeed unexpected that our anti-aircraft gunners' skills could be trained so well. The soldiers are all from peasant backgrounds, and it is not easy to master modern weapons at first. When aiming at the beginning, they often aimed poorly. Sometimes, when they were fighting the enemy fiercely, the gun would be strange, silently jamming, or they couldn't load the shells. It really made people break out in a cold sweat! But is there anything in the world that can stump the Chinese people? Everyone practiced all day long. When they saw a crow appear in the distance, they turned the steering wheel and rushed to grab the target. Every time a malfunction occurred during combat, they didn't even feel like eating, and stayed in the snow, freezing their hands and feet, and didn't change places until they found the problem.

    I met a gunner named Yan Shukuai. His voice was hoarse when he spoke, and he was not outstanding, but his deeds were surprisingly strange. Once, the enemy attacked our artillery position, and the position was covered with dust and dirt, and nothing could be seen clearly. Yan Shukuai heard the bombs falling with a swoosh, and without hesitation, continued to grab his target. The blast of the bombs blew Yan Shukuai and several other gunners off the gun, completely buried in the soil. The medic rushed to save him, but Yan Shukuai said: "I'm fine, you should save others first." Yan Shukuai struggled to crawl out of the soil, only feeling his hands weak, his head dizzy, and his voice weakened. In a daze, he still asked:

    "How is the gun? Is it broken?" He fell after a few steps. His head and back were hit by shrapnel, and he had to go to the hospital.

    But who can stay in the hospital? He missed the gun, he missed the comrades in the company. As soon as his injury healed, he immediately ran back and got back on the gun. It's just that his arm wasn't working well, and it was very inconvenient to turn the gun. He couldn't fight. Yan Shukuai remembered what the instructor said. The instructor often said: "There are no difficulties in front of a Communist Party member." If the arm wasn't working well, then practice. He sat on the gun and turned the steering wheel, making it whir, practicing until his arm ached and he forgot to eat. The company commander was afraid that he would get exhausted, so he didn't let him practice. He practiced secretly. He got up dozens of minutes earlier than others every day and practiced for a while. At noon, he asked to be on duty during the nap and practiced for another two hours. After practicing for more than half a month, it was okay, and the gun was firing flexibly and accurately again. Who knew that one time, the commander suddenly discovered that he was deaf. How could a deaf person hear combat orders? To tell the truth, he was really clever. He agreed on a signal with the gunner behind him. If the order was to shoot to the left, the gunner would poke his left back with his knee. If it was to the right, he would poke his right back. The orders were executed so correctly, and the gun fired so beautifully, who could tell that he was deaf.

    When I met Yan Shukuai, I really couldn't help but admire his tenacious fighting spirit. Perseverance and tenacity are one of the great invincible qualities of the Chinese people. Our people have ideas and beliefs, plus this irresistible fighting spirit, what force can stop us from moving forward?

    The enemy just doesn't understand this. For a while, the enemy played another trick, specializing in using "B-29" type aircraft to bomb at night. The "B-29" type aircraft flew especially high, and the direction, speed, and time were all calculated. As soon as they flew to the place, they immediately dropped bombs without circling, wow wow like a storm, and after one plane finished dropping bombs, another plane came, and the bombing time sometimes extended to four or five hours a night. The anti-aircraft guns were firing, but the enemy planes were flying too high to hit accurately.

    The enemy was very proud, buzzing in the high sky, as if saying: See what else you can do?

    This evening, the great bombing began again. I suddenly heard someone outside shouting: "Come out and see!" I put on my shoes and ran to the courtyard.

    I saw several intersecting searchlight beams shooting from the ground, illuminating a clumsy "B-29" type aircraft. The enemy plane was flying slowly, and our searchlights slowly "escorted" it. Suddenly, a string of small red fireballs shot out from the pitch-black high sky, straight into the back of the enemy plane. Was this anti-aircraft fire? No. Why was there no sound from the anti-aircraft guns? Also, the bullets shouldn't be coming from above. Just as everyone was wondering, another string of red fireballs flew up diagonally from below, straight into the belly of the enemy plane. The enemy plane crashed, shattered into pieces, and burned into several large fires. It slowly fell down, and the searchlights illuminated this spectacle, allowing the comrades on the ground to see it clearly.

    The comrades on the ground clapped and cheered. What was going on? It turned out that our night-flying aircraft had been dispatched, and in cooperation with the searchlight troops, had revealed this skill. The Chinese People's Volunteers were so happy that they shouted:

    "Give it a string of candied haws to eat!" This night, right above our heads, our night-flying aircraft were really generous, and presented the enemy with string after string of candied haws, shooting down three "B-29" type aircraft in a row.

    Since then, the enemy has not dared to come. The Chinese People's Volunteers, like those suffering from lovesickness, often muttered: "Come on! Why aren't you coming?" But the enemy didn't dare to come.

    In North Korea, it is by many anti-aircraft gunners like Yan Shukuai, who are tenacious and persevering, and by many "little swallows" like this night-flying aircraft, who are brave and clever, and by forming a battle line with the Korean People's Army, that the peaceful sky of northern Korea is guarded. That air force officer misjudged the strength of the Chinese and Korean people, and naturally had to be shot down. Truman didn't have eyes, and deserved to be shot down. Eisenhower still hasn't woken up, you wait and see, sooner or later he will be shot down too.

    朝鲜的天空
    本报特约记者  杨朔
    有一天，我去一处设在山头大洞子里的高射炮指挥所。傍晚，我出指挥所下山时，张眼一望，可真吃了一惊。山下闪闪烁烁的，好几处露着灯火，也不防空，我心里想：这不是开玩笑吗？
    一位指挥员笑笑说：“是有点大意。不过不要紧，敌人的飞机不敢来，来了准揍掉它。”
    这使我想起许多事情。我想起一九五零年冬天志愿军刚过鸭绿江时敌机那个猖狂样子，它们贴着山头飞，像走平道一样，翅膀有时碰到电线杆子；从头顶一飞，忽地带起一阵暴风，地面积雪被扇起来，把人都埋上一层雪。可是现在呢？
    现在你瞧瞧吧，夜晚只要强盗一露鬼脸，地面便喷起一溜一溜的红火球，像焰火，也像喷泉，密密罩住北朝鲜的天空，鸟儿也突不过这张火网去。要是在白天，你可以看见被高射炮火击中的敌机尾巴上冒着股黑烟，醉咕隆咚乱翻筋头，一路从半天空摔下来。驾驶员要是用降落伞跳下来，地面部队就该忙着捉俘虏了。
    有一回，我们的高射炮兵捉到敌人一个空军军官。那个军官很懂得投降的仪式，先举手缴枪，老老实实戴上他的破帽子让你照像，然后考虑着字眼问道：“有几件事我不明白。你们部队也不挣钱，怎么士气这样高？中国人和朝鲜人怎么那样好？我
    也料不到你们会打得这样准。”
    要不准，就能一下子揍掉你啦。我们高射炮手的技术能练的这样精，也确实叫人意想不到。都是农民出身的战士，乍一掌握现代化武器，是不容易。刚开始瞄准时，常常瞄不好，有时正跟敌人打到热闹头上，那炮也怪，不声不响便卡了壳，要不就压不进炮弹去。真把人急出一头冷汗！可是，世界上还有什么事能难倒中国人民么？大家便整天练，见到远处出现一只黑老鸹，也要转动方向盘，紧忙着抓目标。每次作战发生故障，饭也没心思吃了，都留在大雪地里，冻僵手，冻僵脚，也不换地方，非找出毛病不可。
    我见到个炮手，叫阎书魁，说话时是哑嗓子，很不出奇，但是他的事迹可怪出奇的。有一次敌人袭击我们的炮阵地，阵地上打得被灰土罩严了，什么都看不清。阎书魁听见炸弹唰地落下，也不管，照样抓他的目标。炸弹掀起的暴风把阎书魁等几个炮手吹下炮来，整个叫土埋住了。卫生员赶着去救他，阎书魁却说：“我不要紧，你们先去救别人吧。”阎书魁自己扒着土挣扎起来，光觉两手发软，头发懵，说话声音也小了，在迷迷糊糊当中，还问：
    “炮怎么样？坏了没有？”走几步便跌倒了。他的头，他的后背，都被弹片打进去了，不得不到医院去。
    但是谁能在医院里躺得住呢？他想念那门炮，想念连里的同志。伤刚一好，他立刻跑回来，又上了炮。只是胳膊不灵，转起炮来很不方便。没法打仗。阎书魁想起指导员的话。指导员常说：“共产党员面前没有任何困难。”胳膊不灵就练呀。他坐在炮上，把方向盘转得呜呜转，练得胳臂发酸，忘了吃饭。连长怕他累坏了，不叫他练。他就偷着练。天天比别人早起床几十分钟，练上一气。晌午睡午觉，他要求值班，又练上两个钟头。练了半个多月，行了，炮打的又灵活，又准确。谁知有一回，指挥员忽然发现他是个聋子。聋子怎么能听作战口令呢？说来他也真乖，他和背后的炮手约好记号，口令要是喊打得偏左，背后就用膝盖顶他的左背，偏右就顶他的右背。口令执行得这样正确，炮打得又那么漂亮，谁能看出他是个聋子呢。
    我见到阎书魁时，实在不能不佩服他那种顽强的战斗精神。坚忍，顽强，正是中国人民不可战胜的伟大品格之一。我们的人民有思想，有信仰，再加上这种锐不可当的战斗精神，什么力量能阻止我们前进呢？
    敌人偏偏不明白这点。有一阵，敌人又耍另外的花招，专在夜间用“B—二九”型飞机来炸。“B—二九”型飞机飞得特别高，方向，航速，时间，都计算好，只要一飞到地方，不用盘旋，立刻投弹，哇哇像狂风暴雨一样，一架投完又来一架，轰炸的时间一夜有时延长到四、五小时。高射炮打吧，敌机飞得太高，也打不准。
    敌人可得了意，在高空嗡嗡响着，好像是说：看你还有什么办法？
    这天晚间，大轰炸又开始了。我忽然听见外边有人嚷：“快出来看哪！”我便穿上鞋跑到院子里。
    只见地面射出几道交叉的探照灯光，照着了一架笨重得要命的“B—二九”型飞机。敌机慢慢飞着，我们的探照灯便慢慢“护送”着它。突然有一串小小的红火球从漆黑的高空穿出来，直穿进敌机的背上去。这是高射炮火吗？不是。高射炮怎么没有声？再说子弹也不该从上面出现。大家正怀疑，又一串红火球从底下斜着飞上去，直穿进敌机肚子去。敌机哗地碎了，碎得四分五裂，燃烧成几团大火。慢慢往下落，探照灯就照着这片奇景，让地面的同志看了个饱。
    地面的同志都拍手叫起好来。这到底是怎么回事呢？原来是我们的夜航机出动了，和探照灯部队配合起来，露了这一手。志愿军战士乐得直叫：
    “给它一串糖葫芦吃！”这一晚间，就在我们头顶上，我们的夜航机也真大方，奉送了敌人一串又一串糖葫芦，接连打下三架“B—二九”型飞机。
    从此敌人不敢来了。志愿军像害相思病似的，常常叨念着说：“来呀！怎么不来了？”可是敌人不敢来了。
    在北朝鲜，就是由许许多多像阎书魁那样顽强坚忍的高射炮手，由许许多多像这架夜航机那样勇敢灵巧的“小燕子”，和朝鲜人民军结成一条战线，警卫着朝鲜北部的和平的天空。那个空军军官把中朝人民的力量估计错了，自然要被打掉。杜鲁门没长眼睛，活该也被打掉。艾森豪威尔还不醒悟，你等着瞧吧，早晚也要被打掉的。
