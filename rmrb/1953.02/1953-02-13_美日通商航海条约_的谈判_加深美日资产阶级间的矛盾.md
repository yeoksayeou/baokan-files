Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, February 12th: The "U.S.-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation," a tool for U.S. monopoly capital to further control the Japanese economy, is still in the negotiation stage, but it has already caused sharp contradictions between the U.S. and Japanese bourgeoisie. The dissatisfaction and opposition of the Japanese bourgeoisie to this treaty is increasing day by day.

The "Japan Federation of Employers' Associations," an organization of numerous Japanese capitalists, sent a delegation on the 6th to meet with Finance Minister Tadaharu Mukai and Foreign Minister Katsuo Okazaki of the Yoshida government, expressing opposition to relaxing Japan's current "Foreign Investment Law" in the "U.S.-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation," allowing U.S. capital to purchase shares of Japanese companies without restriction and manipulate various economic sectors of Japan. The Japanese bourgeoisie is extremely afraid that this will seriously harm their own interests. The "Japan Federation of Employers' Associations" warned that the influence of foreign capital in Japan is already very strong. If Americans are allowed to freely purchase shares of Japanese companies according to the new treaty, they "can manipulate the market for speculation" and "control basic industries and import and export companies." The delegation also requested the Yoshida government to adopt a "tough attitude" towards the United States.

At the same time, Japanese bourgeois newspapers, commenting on the "U.S.-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation" negotiations, also angrily stated that the U.S. side "completely disregarded" Japan's interests. The "Mainichi Shimbun" reflected the opinions of Japanese business circles, saying that the United States is single-mindedly trying to "dominate Japanese industry." The newspaper warned on the 8th that U.S. capital wants to use its superior position to make Japanese industry lose its ability to compete with the U.S. and dominate the Japanese domestic market. The newspaper opposes U.S. capital enjoying "national treatment" in Japan and demands resistance to the pressure of U.S. capital. The cries of resistance from the Japanese bourgeoisie have forced the American "New York Times" to admit that the intrusion of American capital has aroused numerous protests from the Japanese side.

The contradictions between the U.S. and Japanese bourgeoisie caused by the "U.S.-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation" negotiations have long been reflected within the Yoshida government. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Finance of the Yoshida government already have divergent opinions on many clauses of the "U.S.-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation" draft. The Ministry of Finance opposes relaxing the "Foreign Investment Law" and other regulations that allow U.S. capitalists to enjoy so-called "national treatment" in Japan. Despite this, the traitorous Yoshida government is still prepared to satisfy the insatiable demands of U.S. monopoly capital as much as possible. According to Agence France-Presse, the Yoshida Cabinet decided on the basic policy regarding the "U.S.-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation" at a special meeting on the 7th. Foreign Minister Okazaki said after the meeting that the Yoshida government's "new policy will facilitate U.S. investment in Japan to the greatest extent possible."

    “美日通商航海条约”的谈判
    加深美日资产阶级间的矛盾
    【新华社十二日讯】东京消息：作为美国垄断资本进一步控制日本经济的工具的“美日通商航海条约”，虽然尚在谈判阶段，但是已经引起了美、日资产阶级之间的尖锐矛盾。日本资产阶级对这个条约的不满和反对，一天天增加起来。
    会员众多的日本资本家的组织“日本经营者团体联盟”，在六日派了一个代表团去见吉田政府的藏相向井忠晴和外相冈崎胜男，表示反对在“美日通商航海条约”中放宽日本现行“外资法”，允许美国资本无限制地购买日本公司的股票，操纵日本各经济部门。日本资产阶级极怕这样将严重危害他们自身的利益。“日本经营者团体联盟”警告说：外国资本在日本的势力已经非常雄厚，如果再允许美国人按照新条约自由购买日本公司的股票，他们就“可以操纵市场进行投机”，并“控制基本的工业和进出口公司”。代表团并要求吉田政府对美国采取“强硬态度”。
    和这同时，日本资产阶级的报纸在评论“美日通商航海条约”谈判时，也愤慨地认为美方“完全无视”日方的利益。“每日新闻”反映日本工商界的意见说：美国一心想“统治日本工业”。该报在八日提出警告说：美国资本想利用它的优势地位来使日本工业丧失和美方竞争的能力，并主宰日本国内市场。该报反对美国资本在日本享有“国民待遇”，并要求反抗美国资本的压力。日本资产阶级反抗的呼声使美国“纽约时报”也不得不承认：美国资本的入侵已引起日本方面的纷纷抗议。
    “美日通商航海条约”谈判所引起的美、日资产阶级之间的矛盾早已在吉田政府的内部有了反映。吉田政府的外务省和大藏省已在“美日通商航海条约”草案的许多条款上发生了分歧的意见。大藏省反对放宽“外资法”和其他允许美国资本家在日本享有所谓“国民待遇”的规定。虽然如此，卖国的吉田政府仍准备尽量满足美国垄断资本贪得无厌的要求。据法新社报道，吉田内阁在七日的特别会议上决定了关于“美日通商航海条约”的基本政策。外相冈崎在会后说：吉田政府的“新政策将在最大可能范围内便利美国在日本的投资”。
