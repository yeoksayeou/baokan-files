    Since the World Federation of Democratic Youth and the International Student Union called on the youth of all countries to hold "Day of Struggle Against Colonial System" every year on February 21, the national liberation movement, with the active participation and support of the vast number of young people around the world, is being pushed to a new upsurge and victory year after year. The Chinese and Korean People's forces fought side by side, defeated the aggression plan of US imperialism, and deepened the crisis of the total collapse of the imperialist colonial system. The national liberation wars in Vietnam, Malaya, and the Philippines have also made significant progress. In Burma, India, Indonesia, Iran, Egypt, and other countries, the national liberation struggle is rising with world-shaking momentum. Moreover, "the national liberation movement to break free from the shackles of colonial and semi-colonial rule has developed from Asia and Africa to Latin America." (Zhou Enlai's Political Report at the Fourth Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference)
    The struggle of the people of all countries against the colonial slavery system maintained by US imperialism is increasingly becoming a powerful guarantee for world peace and has received widespread sympathy and support from peace advocates. At the Asian and Pacific Peace Conference and the World People's Peace Congress, the peace representatives unanimously condemned the war policy and aggression policy of the US imperialists, pointing out that this policy seriously threatens and destroys the independence, sovereignty, and peaceful lives of many countries, calling on the people of all countries to resolutely rise up to defend peace, oppose infringements on national sovereignty, demand an end to existing wars, withdraw foreign troops, abolish foreign military bases, and develop economic and cultural exchanges among the people of all countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. Every victory of the people of all countries in these struggles is clearly a major contribution to world peace.
    Stalin's speech at the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union gave tremendous encouragement to the struggle of the people of all countries for national independence and democratic freedom. He taught us that the bourgeoisie, which was once regarded as the leader of the nation, has now abandoned the banner of national independence and national sovereignty. They sell out national rights and independence in exchange for dollars. Therefore, the representatives of communist and democratic parties must raise this banner and advance under it. At the same time, he pointed out that because in addition to the Soviet Union as a "shock brigade," there are also new "shock brigades" of people's democratic countries, and the main enemy of the liberation movement has lost contact with the people and weakened itself, the communist, democratic or worker-peasant parties that have not yet seized power can work more smoothly and achieve victory.
    The development of the national liberation movement after the war powerfully proves Stalin's brilliant conclusion. US imperialism, on the one hand, helps the weakened British and French colonialist countries to restore their dark rule over the colonies, and on the other hand, "kills two birds with one stone" by forcing these "friends" to sell out the independence and sovereignty of their own countries and seizing the colonies and dependencies in their hands. The ruling classes of many colonies and dependencies have also succumbed to the American aggressors, abandoned the banner of national independence, and some have even openly acted as accomplices in America's aggressive wars. This makes the contradictions between imperialists, as well as the contradictions between imperialism and the colonies, increasingly acute. The working class and its vanguard—the communist, democratic, or worker-peasant parties—of the colonies and dependencies must unswervingly hold high the banner of national independence and continue to advance victoriously under it. They are increasingly fully learning from the examples of struggle and success provided by the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, increasingly closely uniting all patriots, including the national bourgeoisie, especially the broad masses of laboring peasants, consolidating and expanding the national united front, and closely uniting with the revolutionary movement of the international working class and the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, they are increasingly exerting the infinite power sufficient to defeat the forces of imperialist aggression. The victorious development of the national liberation movement sweeping Asia, Africa, and Latin America vividly confirms that Lenin's and Stalin's brilliant theory of national liberation struggle is an invincible and sharp weapon.
    Not only that, but the people of the colonies and dependencies have also seen from daily international practical life the economic prosperity of the Soviet Union, China, and other people's democratic countries, which have been freed from the shackles of capitalism, and the continuous growth of the happy lives of all ethnic groups, which is in sharp contrast to the tragic experiences of their own countries being long trapped in industrial backwardness, economic bankruptcy, and poverty under imperialist enslavement. For example, the electricity produced by the five Soviet republics in eastern Soviet Union (Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan), with a population of about 17 million, is three times the total electricity produced by Turkey, Iran, Pakistan, Egypt, Iraq, Syria, and Afghanistan, which have a population of 156 million. China was also an extremely backward country during the period of imperialist rule, but after a short three-year period of economic recovery after liberation, it began a large-scale five-year economic construction plan this year. At the recent ninth session of the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East, the Soviet representative and the World Federation of Trade Unions delegation powerfully exposed the evil consequences of the US aggression policy and war policy for many Asian countries. In order to expand its arms race, the United States, under the guise of aid from the so-called "Point Four Program," intensified its plunder of raw materials, dumping of goods, and implementation of a blockade and embargo policy on many Asian countries, hindering their trade with the Soviet Union and China, resulting in new disasters such as production contraction, trade reversal, and further deterioration of people's lives in these countries. This is an indisputable fact. Many representatives of Asian and Far Eastern countries attending the meeting also admitted that although their countries have abundant natural resources and manpower, the people suffer deeply from poverty and hunger due to the plunder of colonial state monopoly capital. In contrast, the Soviet Union, China, and other people's democratic countries are willing to expand trade with Asian and Far Eastern countries on the basis of equal rights, respect for sovereignty, and reciprocity. The five-year trade agreement between China and Ceylon for the purchase and sale of rubber and rice is a vivid example of equal and mutually beneficial trade. The Soviet representative also stated that the Soviet Union is ready to transport industrial equipment, machinery, and other goods needed for the development of industry, transportation, and agriculture in exchange for goods that Asian and Far Eastern countries have always exported, in order to promote the economic development of these countries. All these facts eloquently demonstrate that only when national independence is guaranteed, only by resolutely opposing the imperialist war policy and colonial policy, and only by striving to increase friendly cooperation with the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, is it possible to develop one's own country's economic and cultural life and maintain international peace and security. Therefore, this cannot but increasingly widely arouse the hatred of the oppressed and enslaved colonial people for US imperialism, making them more conscious and more firmly involved in the just struggle for national liberation.
    The imperialist group headed by the United States is by no means reconciled to its failure in Asia and the disintegration of its colonial slavery system, and they are struggling more and more frantically. The Eisenhower government openly clamored to expand the war of aggression aimed at enslaving the whole of Asia, intensified its coercion of its vassal states to expand their arms race with it, and attempted to use the trick of "Asians fighting Asians" to try its best to gather together a few reactionaries in Asia, first of all, to step up the rearmament of Japanese militarist forces, organize the Pacific Aggression Group, and further instruct and assist the remnants of Syngman Rhee, Bao Dai, and Chiang Kai-shek to act as its aggressive pawns. They also actively use some right-wing social democrats who betray national interests to incite nationalism and chauvinism, divide and undermine the national liberation movement. US imperialism has become the most ferocious enemy of the national liberation movement. However, the liberation struggles of the people of Korea, Vietnam, and Malaya prove that the US plan to expand the war of aggression and all its conspiracies and tricks can be completely defeated. From the experience of long-term struggle, the people of all countries have deeply realized that in order to break free from the shackles of imperialism and consolidate and expand the gains already made, they cannot compromise, succumb, or place any illusions on imperialism, but must carry out a resolute and thorough struggle to achieve it.
    With the existence of the powerful Soviet Union, China, and other people's democratic countries, with the consolidation and development of the Sino-Soviet friendly alliance, and with the continuous growth of the forces of the peaceful, democratic, and socialist camp, the national liberation struggles of the people of Asia and other countries will surely move towards victory. It is absolutely impossible for the United States and other colonial countries to save the death of the entire colonial system. The great Lenin, in an article thirty years ago ("Better Fewer, But Better"), had already foreseen: "The outcome of the struggle depends in the last resort on the fact that Russia, India, China, etc., account for the overwhelming majority of the population. And it is this majority that, during the past few years, has been drawn into the struggle for emancipation with extraordinary rapidity, so that in this respect there cannot be the slightest doubt what the final outcome of the world struggle will be. In this sense, the complete victory of Socialism is fully and absolutely assured." Lenin's prediction has become a vivid reality. The liberation movement of the people of all oppressed nations will continue to realize Lenin's scientific prophecy on a wider scale.

    高举民族独立的旗帜英勇前进
    自从世界民主青年联盟和国际学生联合会号召各国青年在每年二月二十一日举行“反对殖民地制度斗争日”以来，有全世界广大青年积极参加和支援的民族解放运动，正在一年一年地推向新的高涨和胜利的道路。中朝人民部队并肩作战，打败了美帝国主义的侵略计划，加深了帝国主义殖民体系总崩溃的危机。越南、马来亚和菲律宾的民族解放战争，也有了重大的进展。在缅甸、印度、印度尼西亚、伊朗、埃及和其他国家，民族解放斗争正以震动世界的声势日益高涨着。并且，“为了挣脱殖民地半殖民地枷锁的民族解放运动已从亚洲、非洲发展到了拉丁美洲。”（周恩来同志在中国人民政协第一届全国委员会第四次会议上的政治报告）
    各国人民反对美帝国主义所维护的殖民地奴役制度的斗争，日益成为世界和平的有力保障，并得到了和平拥护者广泛的同情和支持。在亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议和世界人民和平大会上，和平代表们都一致谴责美帝国主义者的战争政策和侵略政策，指出这个政策严重地威胁和破坏着许多国家的独立主权和和平生活，号召各国人民坚决地起来保卫和平，反对侵犯民族主权，要求结束现有的战争，撤退外国驻军，取消外国军事基地，在平等互利基础上发展各国人民之间的经济交流和文化交流。各国人民在这些斗争中的每一个胜利，显然都是对于世界和平的重大贡献。
    斯大林同志在苏联共产党第十九次代表大会上的演说，给了各国人民争取民族独立和民主自由的斗争以莫大的鼓舞。他教导我们说：曾经被当作民族的领袖的资产阶级，现在已经把民族独立和民族主权这面旗帜抛在一边了。他们出卖民族的权利和独立来换取美元。因此，共产主义和民主的政党的代表们，必须举起这面旗帜，打着这面旗帜前进。同时，他又指出：由于除了苏联这支“突击队”以外，还出现了人民民主国家这些新的“突击队”，解放运动的主要敌人，又已经失去了和人民的联系，削弱了自己，因而还没有取得政权的共产主义的、民主的或工农的政党，就能够更顺利地进行工作，并取得胜利。
    战后民族解放运动的发展，有力地证明着斯大林同志的天才论断。美帝国主义一面帮助已被削弱了的英、法殖民主义国家，重新恢复它们对殖民地的黑暗统治，一面则“一箭双雕”地既要强制它的这些 “朋友”出卖自己国家的独立主权，又要把它们手里的殖民地和附属国夺取过来。许多殖民地和附属国的统治阶级，也屈从于美国侵略者，抛弃了民族独立的旗帜，有的甚至公然充当了美国进行侵略战争的帮凶。这使得帝国主义之间的矛盾，以及帝国主义和殖民地的矛盾，日益剧烈起来。殖民地和附属国的工人阶级及其先锋队——共产主义的、民主的或工农的政党，就要义不容辞地高举着民族独立的旗帜，打着它继续胜利前进。他们越来越充分地学习苏联和各人民民主国家所提供的斗争和成功的榜样，越来越紧密地团结包括民族资产阶级在内的一切爱国者、特别是广大的劳动农民群众，巩固着和扩大着民族统一战线，并且同国际工人阶级的革命运动密切联合，同以苏联为首的社会主义阵营密切联合，他们就越来越发挥着足以战胜帝国主义侵略势力的无穷力量。席卷亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的民族解放运动的胜利发展，生动地证实了列宁、斯大林关于民族解放斗争的辉煌学说是不可战胜的锐利武器。
    不仅这样，殖民地和附属国人民还从日常的国际实际生活中，看到摆脱了资本主义枷锁的苏联、中国及其他人民民主国家经济繁荣和各族人民幸福生活的不断增长，这种情况与本国在帝国主义奴役下长期陷于工业落后、经济破产和人民生活贫困的悲惨遭遇，形成强烈的对照。例如，苏联东部拥有约一千七百万人口的五个苏维埃共和国（乌兹别克、哈萨克、吉尔吉斯、土库曼、塔吉克）所生产的电力，为拥有一亿五千六百万人口的土耳其、伊朗、巴基斯坦、埃及、伊拉克、叙利亚及阿富汗各国总共生产的电力的三倍。中国在帝国主义统治时期也是一个极度落后的国家，但解放后经过短短三年的经济恢复时期，今年就开始了大规模的五年经济建设计划。在最近举行的联合国亚洲与远东经济委员会第九届会议上，苏联代表和世界工联代表团都有力地揭露了美国的侵略政策和战争政策给许多亚洲国家带来了怎样的恶果。美国为了扩军备战，在所谓“第四点计划”的援助的掩护下，加紧它对许多亚洲国家的原料掠夺，倾销商品，并实行封锁禁运政策，阻挠它们和苏联及中国的贸易，造成了这些国家生产萎缩，贸易逆转和人民生活更加恶化等等新的灾难。这是不容争辩的事实。出席会议的亚洲和远东国家的许多代表也承认：虽然他们国家拥有丰富的天然资源和人力，但由于殖民国家垄断资本的掠夺，人民深深受到贫困和饥饿的痛苦。和这相反，苏联、中国和其他人民民主国家则愿意根据平等权利、尊重主权和互惠的原则，扩大和亚洲及远东各国的贸易。中国和锡兰缔结买卖橡胶大米的五年贸易协定，就是平等互利的贸易的生动例子。苏联代表还表示：苏联准备运送工业设备、机器以及发展工业、运输业和农业所需要的其他货物，来交换亚洲及远东各国一向输出的货物，以促进这些国家的经济发展。所有这些事实都雄辩地说明：只有民族独立获得了保障，只有坚决反对帝国主义的战争政策和殖民政策，只有争取增进和苏联及人民民主国家的友好合作，才有可能发展自己国家的经济和文化生活，维护国际和平和安全。因此，这就不能不日益广泛地引起被压迫被奴役的殖民地人民对美帝国主义的仇恨，使他们更加觉悟，更坚定地投入民族解放的正义斗争。
    以美国为首的帝国主义集团绝不甘心于它们在亚洲的失败，及其殖民地奴役制度的瓦解，他们正在愈益疯狂地进行挣扎。艾森豪威尔政府公然叫嚣要扩大旨在奴役整个亚洲的侵略战争，加紧逼迫各附庸国和它一起扩军备战，并企图用“亚洲人打亚洲人”的诡计，尽力纠集亚洲的少数反动派，首先是加紧重新武装日本军国主义势力，组织太平洋侵略集团，进一步指使和协助李承晚、保大和蒋介石残匪充当它的侵略爪牙。他们还积极利用背叛民族利益的一些社会党右翼分子，煽动民族主义和沙文主义的情绪，分化和破坏民族解放运动。美帝国主义已成为民族解放运动的最凶恶的敌人。但是，朝鲜、越南和马来亚人民的解放斗争证明：美国扩大侵略战争的计划及其一切阴谋诡计，都是完全可以打败的。各国人民从长期斗争的经历中，已经深切地体会到：要挣脱帝国主义的枷锁，巩固和扩大既得的胜利，是不能向帝国主义妥协、屈服或者寄予任何的幻想，而必须进行坚决的彻底的斗争，才能得到的。
    有着强大的苏联、中国和其他人民民主国家的存在，有着中苏两国友好同盟的巩固和发展，有着和平民主社会主义阵营力量的不断增长，亚洲及其他各国人民的民族解放斗争是一定可以走向胜利的。美国及其他殖民国家要挽救整个殖民制度的死亡，是绝对办不到的。伟大的列宁在三十年前的一篇文章（“宁肯少些，但要好些”）中，就已经预见到：“斗争底结局，归根到底是取决于俄国、印度、中国等等构成世界人口绝大多数的这种情形。正是这世界人口底大多数，最近几年来也非常迅速地卷入谋自身解放的斗争，所以在这个意义上讲来，关于世界斗争问题底最终解决，不能有丝毫的怀疑。所以在这个意义上讲来，社会主义底最后胜利是完全和绝对有了保证的。”列宁的预见已经成为生动的现实了。一切被压迫民族的人民的解放运动还将继续在更广大的范围内实现列宁的科学预言。
