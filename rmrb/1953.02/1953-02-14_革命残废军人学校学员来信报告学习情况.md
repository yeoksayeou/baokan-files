    Letters from Students of Revolutionary Disabled Soldiers Schools Reporting on Study
    Editor's Note: We often receive letters from students of Revolutionary Disabled Soldiers Schools in various places, reporting on their studies. We have selected two to publish below:
    (I)
    A letter from all the students in the junior high school department of the Hubei Provincial Revolutionary Disabled Soldiers School: After the State Council's "Decision on Strengthening Regular Education in Revolutionary Disabled Soldiers Schools" was announced, we began to conduct regular teaching. A year ago, we were still uneducated, but now we have all improved to the junior high school level. Many teachers in Wuhan schools have said that it is rare to see us achieve such great results. This is the result of the correct leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the cultivation of the people, and the enthusiastic education of the teachers.
    Although our bodies are disabled, our minds are healthy. As long as our hearts are still beating, we will serve the cause of the motherland and the people to the end. Comrade Xiong Lihui's right hand was amputated, so he used his left hand to learn to write and has now become a model student. We will definitely learn culture, theory, and technology in a fighting spirit, so that we can better serve the construction of the motherland in the future.
    (II)
    A letter from Lu Zongsheng: I am a revolutionary disabled soldier who was wounded on the Korean battlefield. I entered the Hubei Provincial Revolutionary Disabled Soldiers School in August 1951 to study. At that time, I only knew more than a hundred characters and could not write; I didn't understand arithmetic at all and didn't even recognize numbers. After this stage of study, I can now write articles of seven or eight hundred characters, and I have also learned to calculate areas in arithmetic. I have also learned geography and history, and I know that the motherland is vast and rich in resources and has a long history, which has deepened my love for her.
    I have been able to achieve such results in my studies thanks to the wise leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. I must continue to work hard, overcome the difficulties in learning, and complete the learning tasks assigned to me by the Party and the people.

### 革命残废军人学校学员来信报告学习情况

专栏：读者来信摘要

    革命残废军人学校学员来信报告学习情况
    编者按：我们经常收到各地革命残废军人学校学员来信，报告他们的学习情况，现选择两件登载于后：
    （一）
    湖北省革命残废军人学校初中部全体同学来信：政务院“关于加强革命残废军人学校正规教育的决定”公布后，我们就开始进行正规教学。一年以前我们还是大老粗，现在都提高到初中程度了。武汉市有许多学校的教员都说我们能够得到这样大的成绩，是寻常见不到的事。这都是共产党和毛主席的正确领导，人民的培养和老师们热情教育的结果。
    我们的身体虽然残废了，但我们的思想是健康的。只要我们的心还在跳动，就要为祖国、人民的事业服务到底。熊立辉同志右手被截了，就用左手学习写字，现已成为学习模范。我们一定以战斗的精神来学习文化、理论和技术，将来更好地为祖国的建设服务。
    （二）
    陆宗胜来信：我是一个在朝鲜战场上负伤的革命残废军人，一九五一年八月进湖北省革命残废军人学校学习。那时，我只认识一百多个字，还不会写；算术更不懂，连数字也不认得。经过这一阶段的学习，现在我已能写七八百字的文章，算术也学到计算面积了，我还学了地理、历史，知道祖国地大物博，历史悠久，使我更加深了对她的热爱。
    我在学习上能有这样的成绩，都是共产党和毛主席英明领导的结果。我一定要继续努力，克服学习中的困难，完成党和人民交给我的学习任务。
