Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, February 22nd: The Standing Committee of the All-India Peace Council held a meeting in New Delhi on February 14th and 15th, and passed a resolution on "Defending India's Security and Sovereignty." The resolution stated: In order for India to play an active and constructive role in defending world peace and to safeguard its own independence, it must be ensured that India's resources and manpower, its territory, its ports, airports, transit bases, and territorial waters, and other facilities are not used for war.

The resolution stated: The Standing Committee of the All-India Peace Council calls on all Indians who wish to prevent India from being drawn into war to find ways to ensure that India acts decisively for peace, defends India's security and sovereignty, and demands that the Indian government take the following urgent measures:

    I. Order the immediate closure of the Gurkha barracks and declare that transit facilities for British troops in India will no longer be granted.
    II. Foreign ships and aircraft should not be allowed to use Indian ports and airports to transport personnel and strategic materials for use against the struggle for freedom by the people of Malaya and Vietnam.
    III. Guarantee the incorporation of French and Portuguese-occupied Indian territories into the Republic of India in order to eliminate the possibility of using foreign colonies in India as military bases and transit centers.

In a resolution on the "Middle East Defense Organization," the Standing Committee of the All-India Peace Council pointed out that people from all walks of life in India are unanimously opposed to the U.S. imperialist conspiracy to drag Pakistan into the Middle East aggressive bloc. The resolution also pointed out that the Pakistan peace movement has strongly protested against this conspiracy and called for a strong propaganda campaign to show the determination of the Pakistani people to oppose joining this aggressive bloc.

The resolution stated: "The Middle East Defense Organization is part of the war plans of the U.S. and British governments, and it has been resolutely opposed by the people of the entire Middle East region. Pakistan's accession to this organization will allow foreign military bases to be established on the territory of our neighboring countries, which will bring war to India's doorstep and threaten India's own security.

    There is no doubt that some will try to use the situation created by Pakistan's accession to the Middle East bloc to intimidate India, urging it to conclude similar military agreements, thereby driving us into the center of war preparation.

    Therefore, the Standing Committee of the All-India Peace Council calls for the highest degree of vigilance to deal with the threats to our security and sovereignty, and instructs the Secretariat to maintain close contact with the peace movement in Pakistan in order to take concerted action to counter the vicious conspiracy to drag the people of the two countries into war."

    全印和平理事会常务委员会通过关于“保卫印度安全和主权”等决议
    【新华社新德里二十二日电】全印和平理事会常务委员会二月十四日和十五日在新德里举行会议，通过了关于“保卫印度安全和主权”的决议。决议说：为了使印度能在保卫世界和平方面起积极的和建设性的作用，并维护它自己的独立，必须保证不让印度的资源和人力、它的领土、它的港口、机场、转运基地和领海以及其他设施被用来进行战争。
    决议说：全印和平理事会常务委员会号召一切希望不让印度被卷入战争的印度人，设法使印度确定地为和平而行动，保卫印度的安全和主权，要求印度政府采取下列紧急措施：
    一、下令立刻封闭廓尔喀军营，宣布不再给予英军在印度的过境便利。
    二、不准外国船只和飞机使用印度港口和机场载运人员和战略物资用来对付马来亚和越南人民争取自由的斗争。
    三、保证把法国和葡萄牙所占有的印度领土并入印度共和国，以消除利用外国在印度的殖民地作为军事基地和转运中心的可能性。
    全印和平理事会常务委员会在关于“中东防御组织”的决议中指出，印度各阶层人民一致反对美帝国主义正在进行的想把巴基斯坦拉进中东侵略集团的阴谋。决议并指出，巴基斯坦和平运动对这个阴谋曾提出强硬抗议，并号召开展一个强有力的宣传运动，表明巴基斯坦人民反对参加这个侵略集团的决心。
    决议说：“中东防御组织是美国和英国政府的战争计划的一部分，它已遭受到整个中东地区人民的坚决反对。巴基斯坦加入这个组织后，将使外国的军事基地在我们邻国的领土上建立起来，这样就会把战争带到印度的大门口，威胁印度自己的安全。
    毫无疑问，有人将设法利用巴基斯坦加入中东集团后所造成的局势来恫吓印度，要它也缔结同样的军事协定，从而把我们赶进备战的中心。
    因此，全印和平理事会常务委员会号召以最高度的警惕来应付我们的安全和主权所受到的威胁，并指示秘书处和巴基斯坦的和平运动保持密切联系，以便采取一致行动，来对付想把两国人民拖进战争去的恶毒阴谋。”
