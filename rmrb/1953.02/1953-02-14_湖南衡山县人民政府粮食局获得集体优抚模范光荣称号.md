    Hunan Hengshan County People's Government Grain Bureau Receives Glorious Title of Collective Model for Supporting the Military and Giving Preferential Treatment
    Yan Min writes: Under the patriotic education, all comrades of the Hunan Province Hengshan County People's Government Grain Bureau enthusiastically did a good job in providing preferential treatment and won the glorious title of Collective Model for Supporting the Military and Giving Preferential Treatment.
    All comrades of the bureau combined preferential treatment work with their own business. During the autumn grain collection, when various grain depots in the county collected grain, the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers were given priority in weighing and storing grain, regardless of whether they arrived early or late. Usually, when families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers and demobilized soldiers came to the bureau to allocate grain, the accounting comrades always "allocate grain whenever they arrive, regardless of the time, and allocate whatever grain they need," and also often warmly comforted and encouraged the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers. When the Grain Bureau needed to hire temporary staff, it always gave priority to the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers and demobilized soldiers. Twenty percent of the assistant requisition personnel in the autumn requisition of 1952 were families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers and demobilized soldiers.
    Most of the eighteen cadres of the Grain Bureau are treated with the supply system, but during the New Year and festivals, they all competed to take out their own savings to buy gifts for the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers; they also made great efforts in the donation movement. They often wrote letters of condolence to the Volunteers; when the victory news of "July 1st", "November 1st" and Korea came, they also happily went to the homes of the revolutionary martyrs' families to express their condolences and congratulations. When the news of the victory in the Battle of Shangganling came, Comrade Cao Qingnian of the bureau immediately reported the victory to the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers.
    The comrades of the Grain Bureau’s love and care for the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers is always the same sincere and profound. Once, Comrade Long Tiecheng of the bureau returned from inspecting the work of the grain depot, and met a military family member on the road, carrying a child and a very large bag, and also carrying a large basket of things; Long Tiecheng enthusiastically helped her carry the bag and the bamboo basket, and walked sixty or seventy miles, and sent her all the way home.
    In order to do a better job in providing preferential treatment, they also included it in the patriotic pact, and often checked the implementation, supervised each other, competed with each other, and criticized each other. On December 24, 1952, they were rated as the county's collective model for preferential treatment, and received a banner that read "Supporting the Army and Giving Preferential Treatment to Families of Revolutionary Martyrs and Soldiers is Infinitely Glorious!" Now they have drafted a plan for preferential treatment work in 1953, determined to do a better job in preferential treatment.

    湖南衡山县人民政府粮食局获得集体优抚模范光荣称号
    颜敏来信：湖南省衡山县人民政府粮食局全体同志在爱国主义教育下，热情做好优抚工作，获得了集体优抚模范的光荣称号。
    该局全体同志结合本身业务进行优抚工作。秋征中全县各粮库收粮时，烈军属交粮都是优先过秤，优先入库，不管早晚，随到随收。平常烈军属和复员军人来局拨粮，会计同志不管早晚总是“随到随拨，要那里粮就拨那里粮”，还经常热情地慰问、鼓励烈军属。粮食局需要雇用临时工作人员时，总是优先任用烈军属和复员军人。一九五二年秋征助征人员，就有百分之二十是烈军属和复员军人。
    粮食局十八个干部大部都是供给制待遇，但过年、过节时都争先拿出自己节余下来的钱买礼品给烈军属；在捐献运动中也尽了很大努力。他们经常给志愿军写慰问信；在“七一”、“十一”和朝鲜的胜利消息传来的时候，还欢天喜地地到烈军属家里去慰问和祝贺。这次上甘岭战斗胜利的消息传来，该局曹庆年同志马上向烈军属报捷。
    粮食局同志对烈军属的热爱和关怀随时随地都是一样的诚挚和深切。有一次该局龙铁城同志从粮库检查工作回来，路上碰着一个军属，背着一个孩子和一个很大的袋子，还提着一大筐东西；龙铁城就热情地替她背袋子、提竹筐，走了六七十里路，一直送她到家里。
    他们为了把优抚工作做得更好，又把它订入爱国公约，经常检查执行情况，互相督促，互相竞赛，互相批评。一九五二年十二月二十四日，他们被评选为全县集体优抚模范，得到了“拥军优属，无限光荣！”的锦旗。现在他们已拟订了一九五三年的优抚工作计划，决心把优抚工作做得更好。
