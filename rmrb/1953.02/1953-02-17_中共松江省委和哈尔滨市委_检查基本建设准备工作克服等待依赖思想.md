The CCP Songjiang Provincial Committee and Harbin Municipal Committee
Inspect Basic Construction Preparations, Overcoming Waiting and Dependency Ideologies

[This newspaper report] The CCP Songjiang Provincial Committee and Harbin Municipal Committee promptly inspected and criticized the waiting and dependency ideologies in basic construction preparation work, reversing the slow progress in this area.

In late December of last year and mid-January of this year, the CCP Songjiang Provincial Committee and Harbin Municipal Committee successively conducted in-depth inspections of basic construction preparation work. The inspections revealed that the preparation work of many basic construction units was progressing very slowly, and some had no clue where to even begin. Among the leading cadres of various units, there was a widespread sense of blind optimism and reliance on others.

The basic construction task of Harbin Medical University is very heavy, with a building area of nearly 50,000 square meters. However, the school only had seven cadres in charge of basic construction. So far, they haven’t even ordered a single brick, the warehouse for storing materials has not been settled, the construction contract has been delayed, they haven’t taken the initiative to contact the design department, and no geological exploration has been carried out. Faced with such a serious situation, the school's leading cadres were unhurried, assuming that others would prepare everything for them. Another example is Factory 674, whose basic construction workload is very large, requiring a rapid strengthening of its basic construction force. However, the leading cadres of the factory only knew how to ask for help and did not make use of their own strength. They believed: "Our project is very important, so you should support us. If there are difficulties, you must help us overcome them, and if we don't have cadres, you have to send them to us." They were just shouting everywhere: "We don't have the strength! We don't have the experience! We need support!" As a result, the basic construction organization, which should have had more than 300 people, currently has less than half that number. Of the four required department heads, not even one has been appointed, and six of the fourteen sections are completely vacant. In reality, they only used one-fifth of the factory's existing strength for basic construction work, and especially the main cadres have not been transferred from production.

In response to the above situation, the Songjiang Provincial Basic Construction Committee convened a meeting of representatives from various basic construction units on January 10, focusing on criticizing blind optimism and dependency ideologies. Li Changqing, Secretary of the CCP Songjiang Provincial Committee, gave a report at the meeting. He clearly pointed out that the heavy workload and insufficient strength are common problems in the current basic construction preparation work. To solve this contradiction, cooperation and support from all sides are necessary, but the main reliance should be on self-reliance. Therefore, all blind optimism and dependency ideologies are harmful, and the result will inevitably delay the progress of basic construction. He then pointed out that in the preparation work, not only should the difficulties be recognized, but more importantly, the potential strength should be tapped and the cultivation of new forces should be emphasized. He requested that all units conscientiously implement the policy of self-reliance, actively cultivate and rapidly strengthen their own forces, proactively overcome various difficulties, and accelerate the various preparations to strive for basic construction to be carried out according to plan.

After ideological criticism, the basic construction preparation work of various units has been rapidly carried out. For example, a certain engineering college with a huge project did nothing before the meeting. After the meeting, the leading cadres of the unit immediately held a cadre meeting to examine and criticize the ideology of waiting and dependency. Then, they actively took action, transferring more than 120 cadres to strengthen the basic construction department, and signed a construction contract with the construction unit. The Deputy Director of Education personally went to Beijing to handle the procedures for appropriation and allocation of materials. Another example is Factory 123, which was criticized during the inspection. It also reversed the waiting ideology and began to improve its organizational structure. In addition to transferring a large number of cadres from production posts, two of the three factory directors were assigned to specialize in basic construction work. From the recent situation, the slow progress of basic construction preparation work in Harbin has been fundamentally changed. Important projects can be completed by the end of March for technical design and detailed construction drawings, but there are still a few units that are changing very slowly, and the relevant leading organs must promptly supervise and inspect them.

### 中共松江省委和哈尔滨市委  检查基本建设准备工作克服等待依赖思想

    检查基本建设准备工作克服等待依赖思想
    【本报讯】中共松江省委员会、哈尔滨市委员会，及时检查，并批判了基本建设准备工作中的等待依赖思想，扭转了基本建设准备工作进展迟缓的状况。
    去年十二月下旬与今年一月中旬，中共松江省委员会、哈尔滨市委员会接连深入检查了基本建设准备工作。在检查中发现许多基本建设单位的准备工作进展十分迟缓，甚至毫无头绪。各单位领导干部中，比较普遍地存在着盲目乐观和等待依赖思想。
    哈尔滨医科大学的基本建设工程任务很重，建筑面积近五万平方公尺，但该校担任基本建设工作的干部仅有七人，到现在连一块砖都没去订，储备材料的仓库还没有着落，委托施工合同迟迟不订，也不主动与设计部门取得联系，地质钻探工作也没有进行。面对如此严重情况，该校领导干部却不慌不忙，以为人家什么都会给他准备好的。又如六七四厂基本建设工程量很大，需要迅速壮大基本建设力量。但该厂领导干部只知伸手要，不去发挥自己的力量。他们认为：我们的工程很重要，你就应该支持，有困难你要帮我们克服，没有干部你得给我们派。他们只是到处叫喊：“我们没有力量呀！没有经验呀！需要支援呀！”因此，本来需要三百多人的基本建设组织，但现在实有人数连一半都不到，需要四个处长，但连一个都没配备，十四个科中有六个科空无一人。实际上他们只动用了工厂中现有力量的五分之一来做基本建设工作，特别是主要的干部还没有从生产方面抽调过来。
    针对以上情况，松江省基本建设委员会于一月十日召集各基本建设单位代表开会，着重批判了盲目乐观和等待依赖思想。会上由中共松江省委员会书记李常青作了报告，他明确指出：任务重、力量不足是当前基本建设准备工作中普遍存在的问题；要解决这个矛盾，各方面的配合与支援是必需的，但主要应靠自力更生。因此，一切盲目乐观、等待依赖思想都是有害的，其结果必然会延误基本建设的进行。接着他又指出：在准备工作中不仅应该看到困难的一方面，更重要的是要挖掘潜在力量和重视新生力量的培养。他要求各单位认真贯彻自力更生的方针，积极培养并迅速壮大有生力量，主动克服各种困难，加紧进行各项准备工作，为按计划进行基本建设而努力。
    经过思想批判，会后各单位的基本建设准备工作已迅速进行。如工程浩大的某工程学院，在会前什么也没有做，会后该单位领导干部立即召开干部会议，检查与批判了等待依赖思想，接着就积极行动起来：抽调一百二十多干部充实基本建设部门，和施工单位签订了委托施工合同，副教育长亲自到北京办理拨款与调拨材料等手续。又如在检查中曾受到批评的一二三厂，也扭转了等待思想，着手健全组织机构，除从生产岗位上抽调大批干部外，并由三个厂长中抽出两个厂长专管基本建设工作。从最近情况看来，哈尔滨市基本建设准备工作进展迟缓的情况已有基本改变，重要工程可于三月底完成技术设计与施工详图，但仍有少数单位转变得很慢，仍须有关领导机关及时进行督促检查。
