    Always a Non-Disabled Warrior
    ——Remembering Volunteer Army Sanatorium Patient Tian Kedong
    Jin Feng
    Before I even entered the room, I heard his hearty laughter. He was discussing the branch work summary with the deputy secretary of the branch. His study notes were spread out on the table, filled with dense writing, such strong and vigorous characters! It's hard to believe that this was written by hands that had lost their fingers, with only half a thumb remaining. The door was half-open, and people were constantly running in and out. An older nurse came in to get a newspaper, and he told me that this was Sister Liang. Then a young nurse ran in to see him, holding her newly issued salary, happily telling him that she was going to send some money home to her mother for the Spring Festival...
    It was immediately clear how familiar and close this Volunteer Army sanatorium patient, Comrade Tian Kedong, was with everyone here.

        A year and a half ago, when the first batch of returning Volunteer Army wounded and sick soldiers were sent to this hospital, Comrade Tian Kedong was one of the most seriously injured. On his admission registration form, his weight was only 42.5 kilograms. He was injured in the pursuit battle of Seoul. At that time, he went to the mountains to inspect the troops' air defense trenches. A napalm bomb landed near him, and the vicious flames quickly burned his head, face, and hands. Bombs, incendiary bombs, and napalm bombs continued to explode around him, and even the more than one-foot-thick snow was blown up. In the burning flames and exploding shrapnel, guard Bai Guangzhen selflessly rushed forward to rescue the beloved leader. A bomb knocked him down, and he unfortunately sacrificed himself. Another guard, He Zhifa, rushed towards Comrade Tian Kedong and saw that the leader's head, face, and hands were all charred, but he still murmured, "How well are the comrades concealed?" Along the way, he was transported by carts and cars, bumping along small and large roads. The wounds were ulcerating, and he was in so much pain that he often fell into a coma. In his coma, he still called out the names of the director and section chief, asking them to check the situation of the troops. His mind was still on the work at the front. He Zhifa listened, secretly shedding tears, forgetting his own danger, and escorting him day and night.
    When he entered the hospital, his life was in danger: his eyelids were burned away, and his eyes could not close all day; the skin of his lips was burned away, and his lips could not open, so he could only use a small rubber tube to send in a little water and juice; his ears, hands, back of his head, and neck were all burned, his neck could not turn, and his hands could not stretch out. In the past year and a half, he underwent fifteen surgeries: removing his left eyeball, repairing his right eyelid, correcting ingrown eyelashes, sawing open the ball-shaped hand bones with a small saw, repairing his lips and outer ears, and grafting skin from his legs and abdomen to his face, back of his head, neck, and hands.
    This was indescribable pain and torment. When he was carried down from the operating table, he felt that his body couldn't hold on in a semi-comatose state, and he couldn't help but call out the names of his wife and children, asking them to avenge him… But as soon as he woke up, he immediately realized that this was a sign of weakness. Communists never bow their heads in the face of any difficulty or danger. In the War of Resistance Against Japan, the War of Liberation, and the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, had he ever retreated in the face of all kinds of ferocious enemies? The pain he was suffering now was precisely so that the sons and daughters of the motherland would not suffer, wasn't it? The Party, love for the people of the motherland, and the great construction of the motherland became the infinite power that encouraged him to overcome physical pain. Although he was lying in a hospital bed, he seemed to be breathing in the fighting atmosphere of the entire world outside the window, following the rapid progress of the people of the motherland. The boiling life outside the window strongly attracted him and called to him, and his heart was also boiling. The belief in wanting to live and wanting to participate in the struggle became stronger and stronger: he must be able to work, and he must strive to go out and work as soon as possible.
    In this way, he strictly demanded of himself: to treat himself with peace of mind, to recuperate optimistically, and to resolutely improve himself during recuperation. When the wound on his right hand was not yet healed, the doctor changed his dressing and asked him to try to clamp the tweezers with his only remaining half-thumb. What a hopeful attempt this was for him! The first time, his trembling thumb didn't hold it. The second time, he gritted his teeth, endured the pain, and his trembling hand actually picked up the tweezers. It worked! This hand was not completely useless. The doctor was happy for him, and he was even more excited and immediately asked the nurse to write a letter to his wife to report the good news, and continued to intensify his training. He practiced hanging clothes, pulling curtains, opening drawers, patting pillows, turning on the heat, moving around in the room, which made the nurses laugh at him: "Comrade Tian is really like a naughty child, even with only half a thumb left, he still refuses to be quiet." He also replied with a smile: "With just this half a thumb, I still have big things to do." Indeed, he quickly tried to hold a pencil and write. Although his hand trembled and the writing was crooked, he felt infinitely happy. He saw that he had opened the door to life and work, and that he could confidently return to the ranks of the battle.
    His sanatorium life became increasingly vibrant. He not only abided by the hospital rules, but also cared very much about the sanatorium patients and hospital staff, talking to them about work, ideological, and life issues, and helping them solve them. The head nurse still had the old working style of medical personnel. Comrade Tian Kedong told her: As a leader, you should not only lead by example, go deep into the wards, and master technical leadership, but also pay attention to ideological leadership, care for the masses, and connect with the masses. He helped her analyze the ideological situation of each staff member and improve her working methods. After she participated in the land reform, she improved further. Comrade Tian Kedong encouraged her to consolidate her existing progress and continue to move forward. He pointed out to her: "Your work has gone from the office to the wards, which is the result of a change in your service perspective. In the past, you cared about the disease, but now you care about the person."
    Comrade Tian Kedong also participated in the staff's reading group, hung a large map of China and a map of the world in the living room, often gave them current events lectures, tested them, and increased their interest in learning about current events. His room was always full of people running in and out, and sometimes the staff simply occupied his room to hold meetings.
    When the Party's sanatorium branch was re-elected, Comrade Tian Kedong was elected as the branch secretary. He became even busier: organizing sanatorium patients to study, caring about their recuperation and nutrition, and ensuring that they abide by hospital rules and recuperate peacefully.
    Therefore, everyone loved this Volunteer Army wounded soldier even more. After a major surgery, the attending physician sent him flowers. After the operation, his appetite was not good, but he never complained about the food. The nurses learned from his wife and guards that he liked spicy green peppers, spicy tofu, and spicy broad bean paste. So they sometimes bought them and brought them to him. When the weather was cold, the head nurse knitted him a sweater, and the nurses sewed him shorts. He never wanted to trouble others, but the staff always quietly rushed to do it for him. The head nurse often said to him with a smile: "The Volunteer Army is really so lovely. Don't go out, stay here and be our director of nursing."
    Comrade Tian Kedong's heart was never separated from the front line. He also thought that his body might not be suitable to return to the front, but having devoted his magnificent youth entirely to the revolutionary war, the troops were like his closest relatives and the home he missed most. He always said: "Regardless of whether I can return to the front in the future, I believe that in the fighting communist cause, I will always be a non-disabled warrior!"

    永远是个不残废的战士
    ——记志愿军休养员田克东
    金凤
    还在门外，我就听到了他爽朗的笑声。他正在和支部副书记研究支部工作总结。桌上摊开着他的学习笔记，写得密密层层的，好一笔挺劲的字！真难相信这就是那双失去了手指，仅剩半截拇指的手写出来的。门半开着，不断有人跑进跑出。一个上了年纪的护士进来拿报纸，他告诉我这是梁大姐。又一个年轻的护士跑来看他，手里拿着刚发的薪水，高高兴兴地告诉他要寄些钱回家给妈妈过春节……
    一眼就看得出，这位志愿军休养员田克东同志，和这里的每个人是多么的熟悉和亲热。
        一年半以前，第一批志愿军归国伤病员送进这个医院来，田克东同志是其中伤势最重的一个。在入院登记表上，他的体重只有四十二公斤半。他是在汉城追击战中受伤的。那时他到山上去检查部队的防空壕，一颗凝固汽油弹落在他身边，恶毒的火焰迅速燃烧着他的头、脸和双手，炸弹、燃烧弹和凝固汽油弹不断在他身边爆炸，一尺多厚的白雪都被炸翻过来了。在燃烧着的火焰与炸弹片的爆炸中，警卫员白光珍舍身前来抢救亲爱的首长，一颗炸弹削倒了他，他不幸牺牲了。另一个警卫员和志发又向田克东同志飞跑过来，看到首长的头、脸和双手都烧糊了，但还喃喃地问：“同志们隐蔽得怎么样啦？”一路上，他由大车、汽车运送着，在小路、大路上颠簸着。伤口在溃烂，人疼得时常昏迷过去。在昏迷中，他还叫着干事、科长的名字，要他们检查部队情况，他一心还在惦记着前方的工作。和志发听着暗暗流泪，也忘了自身的危险，不分白天黑夜地护送着他。
    进院的时候，他的生命是危险的：他的眼皮烧去了，眼睛终日不能闭上；嘴唇皮烧去了，嘴唇不能张开，只能用一根小橡皮管送一点水和饮汁进去；耳朵、双手、后脑部和颈部全烧坏了，颈脖不能转动，双手不能伸开。在一年半时间内他动了十五次手术：摘去左眼球，补上右眼皮，校正倒生的眼毛，把长成球状的双手手骨用小锯锯开，补上嘴唇、外耳，拉下他腿部和腹部的皮肤补在他脸部、后脑部、颈部和手上。
    这是难以形容的痛苦和磨折。当他从手术台上抬下来后，他在半昏迷状态中，觉得身体挺不住了，禁不住叫起他爱人和孩子的名字，要他们为他报仇……但是，一清醒过来，他就立即意识到这是软弱的表现。共产党员在任何困难和危险面前，都是不低头的。在抗日战争、解放战争和抗美援朝斗争中，在各式各样凶恶的敌人面前，自己不是从来没有退却过吗？自己现在所遭受的痛苦，不正是为了祖国儿女不受痛苦吗？党、对祖国人民的热爱和祖国的大建设，成了鼓舞他战胜肉体痛苦的无限力量。他虽然躺在病床上，但他好像呼吸着窗外整个世界的斗争气息，追随着祖国人民一日千里前进的步伐。窗外沸腾着的生活，在强烈地吸引着他，呼唤着他，他的心也在沸腾着。想望生活、想望参加斗争的信念愈来愈强烈：一定能工作，一定争取早日出去工作。
    这样，他就严格要求自己：安心地治疗，乐观地休养，并坚决要在休养中提高自己。当他右手伤口还没有好的时候，大夫给他换药，要他试一试用他仅有的半截拇指来夹一下镊子。这对于他，是多么充满希望的尝试啊！第一次，他颤抖着的拇指没有夹住。第二次，他咬住牙，忍住疼痛，颤抖的手居然把镊子夹起了。行啦！这只手还没有完全报废哩。大夫为他高兴，他更兴奋得马上请护士给他爱人写了封信报告好消息，并且继续加紧锻炼。他练习挂衣服，拉窗帘，开抽屉，拍拍枕头，开开暖汽，在屋子里东拉西动的，惹得护士们都笑他：“田同志真像个顽皮的小孩，只剩半截拇指，也还不肯安静一下。”他也笑着回答：“就凭这半截拇指，我还要办大事情哩。”真的，他很快就尝试夹住铅笔写起字来了。虽然手尽发抖，字写得歪歪扭扭，但是他真感到无限的快乐。他看到自己打开了通向生活—工作的大门，自己可以有把握回到战斗的队伍里去了。
    他的休养生活，日渐沸腾起来了。他不单遵守院规，而且十分关心休养员和医院工作人员，和他们谈工作上、思想上、生活上的问题，并帮助他们解决。护士长还有着旧的医务人员的工作作风。田克东同志就告诉她：做一个领导者不仅应该以身作则，深入病房，掌握技术领导，还要注意思想领导，关心群众，联系群众。他帮助她分析每个工作人员的思想情况，改进工作方法。她参加土地改革回来后，更提高了一步。田克东同志又鼓励她巩固已有的进步，并继续前进。他向她指出：“你的工作从办公室深入到了病房，这是服务观点转变的结果。以前你关心的是病，现在关心到人了。”
    田克东同志还参加了工作人员的读报小组，把自己的一张中国大地图和一张世界大地图挂在客厅里，经常给他们讲时事，测验他们，提高他们学习时事的兴趣。他的屋子里总是不断有人跑出跑进，有时工作人员干脆占用他的屋子来开会。
    党的休养员支部改选时，田克东同志当选了支部书记。他就更加忙碌了：组织休养员学习，关心他们的休养和营养问题，使他们遵守院规安心休养。
    因此，大家更加热爱这个志愿军伤员。动了大手术后，主治大夫给他送鲜花。开刀以后，他的胃口不好，但是他又从来不挑口味。护士们就从他爱人和警卫员那里了解，知道他爱吃辣青椒、辣豆腐、辣豆瓣酱。于是他们有时就买了给他送来。天气冷了，护士长给他打毛衣，护士给他缝短裤。他总不愿意麻烦别人，但工作人员总是悄悄地抢着给他做了。护士长常常笑着对他说：“志愿军真是可爱极了。别出去啦，留在这里当我们的护理部主任吧。”
    田克东同志的心一刻也离不开前方。他也想到自己的身体不一定再适合回到前方去了，但是，曾把自己壮丽的青春完全贡献给了革命战争的他，提到部队，就仿佛是他最亲的亲人，最留恋的家。他总是说：“不管我将来能不能回到前方，但在战斗的共产主义事业中，我相信自己永远是个不残废的战士！”
