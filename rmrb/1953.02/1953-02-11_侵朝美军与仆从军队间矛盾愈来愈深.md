Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front Correspondent Xu Kong reports: The anti-American sentiment of the Rhee puppet army soldiers is getting higher and higher, and the contradictions between officers and soldiers in the puppet army are becoming increasingly acute.

According to the surrendered Rhee puppet army soldiers, recently, American instructors have been generally increased in the puppet army. Each company (lian) has an American lieutenant and an American non-commissioned officer. During the training period of these puppet troops, these American instructors drove Jeeps from the division headquarters to the company every day. As soon as they saw that the military actions of the puppet soldiers were a little slow, or they were "listless," they ordered the puppet army officers to beat them. Some soldiers were even beaten to the point of mental disorder. However, when fighting, these American instructors hid far behind the lines and never showed their faces on the front lines. The puppet soldiers said angrily, "If we have a chance, we must kill these Americans one by one!"

The abuse of soldiers by Rhee puppet army officers is also more severe than before. Recently, the 26th Regiment of the Rhee puppet army’s Capital Division had such an incident: on January 7, Private Hong Xinghan injured his foot, and the bone was exposed. His squad leader, in order to show his superiors that there was "no accident," did not report the incident, and ordered him to continue to stand guard and dig fortifications on the snow-covered mountains. Hong Xinghan climbed up the mountain with a stick, but no matter how he climbed, he couldn't get up. He sat on the snow and cried with his face in his hands. A soldier in the same squad took off his shoe and saw that the wound had festered. If it was not treated immediately, his entire thigh would have to be amputated in the future. So, the soldiers of this squad went to the squad leader together, and the squad leader had to report to the company commander. However, the company commander also refused to allow Hong Xinghan to go to the rear for treatment, and scolded the soldiers for "causing trouble for the company." So the squad leader returned to the team and began to punish those soldiers who sympathized with Hong Xinghan, ordering them to go out on guard at night. Four people were a little slow in their movements, so he ordered them to take off their clothes and crawl in the snow for one hour and twenty minutes, and beat each of them four times, and fined them for not eating breakfast the next morning.

A soldier surnamed Park in the 8th Division of the Rhee puppet army, because he was ill and didn't talk much, the squad leader said that he had listened to the broadcasts from the front of the Korean-Chinese People's Army and wanted to escape, so he beat him severely. Another soldier surnamed Park was singing while chopping trees, and the squad leader said that he wanted to escape in his heart and used singing to cover it up, so he also beat him severely. But after these two puppet army soldiers were beaten, the more they thought about it, the more they felt that what our army broadcast was right, so they ran over and surrendered.

Puerto Rican Soldiers Unwilling to Be Scapegoats

According to Xinhua News Agency: The brutal suppression of Puerto Rican soldiers by the U.S. military authorities has aroused widespread dissatisfaction among Puerto Ricans. According to the New York "Daily Worker," the two major Puerto Rican newspapers "El Mundo" and "El Imparcial" expressed indignation at the Puerto Rican soldiers being convicted in Korea for allegedly refusing to fight. "El Imparcial" requested that the Puerto Rican National Assembly and the U.S. Senate conduct an investigation, given the discrimination against Puerto Rican soldiers by U.S. military officers.

A leader of the Puerto Rican community in New York told a "Daily Worker" reporter: "When senior officers want to punish, the only troops punished are blacks and Puerto Ricans. You haven't seen them sentence white pilots who don't want to fly to ten years in prison." He pointed out that black soldiers in the 25th Infantry Regiment had been severely punished like the Puerto Rican soldiers.

Another Puerto Rican in New York said he believed Puerto Ricans were being used as "scapegoats for the shockingly low morale of the Allied forces in Korea." He said the Puerto Rican cases were reminiscent of the injustices framed against black soldiers by MacArthur's headquarters in 1950.

The "Daily Worker" pointed out that the news that the U.S. 65th Infantry Regiment, composed of Puerto Rican soldiers, had been driven to the front lines again has further aroused the indignation of Puerto Rican residents in New York.

The "Daily Worker" also pointed out that the Puerto Rican people oppose the U.S. war of aggression against Korea and are unwilling to serve as cannon fodder for the United States. A feature writer for Puerto Rico's "El Mundo" recently conducted a survey, and the results showed that the first hope of people from all walks of life in Puerto Rico for the new year is to end the Korean War. "El Mundo" pointed out on December 18, 1952, that the huge casualties suffered by Puerto Rican troops were the second largest total number of deaths and injuries among all countries supporting the U.S. aggression against Korea.

The "Daily Worker" said: The case of a college student named Gabriel Barrera Fuentes is an example of the Puerto Rican people resisting being conscripted to fight for U.S. imperialism. Last November, he was arrested as a "violator of the conscription law," and he is still being held in solitary confinement. His family is constantly persecuted by the FBI. Another significant event was the collective protest in 1952 of 300 conscripted Puerto Rican soldiers, who jumped into San Juan Bay from a departing troop transport ship.

### 侵朝美军与仆从军队间矛盾愈来愈深

    侵朝美军与仆从军队间矛盾愈来愈深
    李伪军士兵反美情绪愈来愈高
    朝鲜前线新华社记者徐孔报道：李伪军士兵的反美情绪愈来愈高，伪军中官兵之间的矛盾也愈来愈尖锐了。
    据投诚的李伪军士兵谈，最近伪军中普遍增加了美国教官，每个中队（连）都有一个美国尉官和一个美国士官。这些美国教官在伪军整训期间，每天坐着吉普车从师团部到中队里去，一看到伪军士兵军事动作做的慢了些，或者“精神不振”，便命令伪军军官殴打他们，有的士兵甚至被打得神经错乱。但在打仗的时候，这些美国教官就躲到很远的后方，从未在前线露过面。伪军士兵们都忿恨地说：“要有机会，非把这些美国佬一个个都打死不可！”
    李伪军军官对士兵的虐待也比以前更加厉害了。最近李伪军首都师二十六联队发生了这样一件事：一月七日一等兵洪性韩脚上负了伤，骨头都露出来了。他的分队长为了向上司表示“无事故”，不把这件事向上报告，命令他继续到积雪很深的山岭上放哨、挖工事。洪性韩拄着棍子往山上爬，但无论如何爬不上，便坐在雪地里捧着脸哭起来。同分队的一个士兵脱下他的鞋一看，伤口已经化脓，如不马上医治，将来非把整个大腿锯掉不可。于是，这个分队的士兵们一起去找分队长，分队长只好向中队长报告。可是中队长同样不准许洪性韩去后方医治，并且大骂士兵们“给中队添麻烦”。于是分队长回到队里，便动手处罚那些同情洪性韩的士兵，命令他们在夜里出去放哨。有四个人动作慢了一些，他便命令他们脱光衣服，在雪地里爬了一小时又二十分钟，并且打了他们每人四棍子，还罚他们第二天早晨不准吃饭。
    李伪军第八师有一个姓朴的士兵，因为有病不大说话，分队长就说他是听了朝中人民军队前线的广播想逃跑，把他毒打了一顿。另一个姓朴的士兵在砍树时唱歌子，分队长说他心里想逃跑，用唱歌来掩饰，也毒打了他一顿。但这两个伪军士兵受了毒打以后，越想越觉得我军广播的话很对，便跑过来投诚了。
    波多黎各士兵不愿作替死鬼
    据新华社讯：美军当局横暴地镇压波多黎各士兵的行为，引起了波多黎各人士的广泛不满。据纽约“工人日报”报道：波多黎各两家大报“世界报”和“公正报”对于波多黎各士兵在朝鲜被控拒绝作战而被判罪一事，表示愤慨。“公正报”鉴于有美国军官歧视波多黎各士兵的情事，要求波多黎各国民议会和美国参议院进行调查。
    纽约波多黎各居民领袖对“工人日报”记者说：“当高级军官要惩罚时，受惩罚的部队只有黑人和波多黎各人。你就没有看到他们给那些不愿飞行的白种飞行员判过十年徒刑。”他指出，第二十五步兵团的黑人士兵就受过像波多黎各士兵那样的重罚。
    另一位纽约的波多黎各人说，他相信波多黎各人正被用来做“在朝鲜的联军的惊人低落的士气”的替罪羊。他说，波多黎各人的案件令人想起一九五零年麦克阿瑟总部陷害黑人士兵的冤狱。
    “工人日报”指出：波多黎各士兵组成的美军第六十五步兵团又被驱往前线的消息，已更加引起纽约波多黎各居民的愤慨。
    “工人日报”并指出：波多黎各人民都反对美国的侵朝战争，不愿为美国充当炮灰。波多黎各的
    “世界报”的特写作家最近进行了一次调查，结果显示波多黎各各阶层人民对新年的第一个希望就是结束朝鲜战争。“世界报”在一九五二年十二月十八日曾指出波多黎各部队所受的巨大伤亡是支持美国侵略朝鲜的一切国家中第二个死伤总数最大的。
    “工人日报”说：一个名叫盖布里尔·巴里拉·方泰斯的大学生的案子，就是波多黎各人民抗拒被征为美帝国主义打仗的例子。去年十一月，他被当做“违反征兵法的人”而被捕，目前他还被单独监禁，他的家庭不时受联邦调查局的迫害。另一个有重要意义的事件是一九五二年波多黎各三百名被征士兵的集体抗议，他们从行将驶出的部队运输舰上跳入圣约翰海湾。
