    The North China People's Hospital, under the Central Ministry of Health, neglects basic construction projects and fails to comply with national budget regulations, resulting in significant losses of state funds. In May 1951, the Central Ministry of Health instructed the North China People's Hospital to add 200 tuberculosis beds to its existing capacity. This task was to be completed by December 1951 or January 1952. Based on this directive, the hospital submitted a budget of over 7.1 billion yuan for basic construction (building new facilities) and the purchase of medical equipment and supplies. 6.58 billion yuan was allocated that year (the basic construction funds were essentially fully allocated), and the remaining funds (for medical equipment) were allocated in full by July 1952. However, leading cadres of the hospital neglected basic construction work, resulting in inadequate planning and several design changes. The buildings were not completed until September of last year, and even by December of last year, the new beds had not been set up. This not only caused a large backlog of state construction funds but also prevented many tuberculosis patients from being admitted to the hospital sooner. Without approval from higher authorities, the hospital arbitrarily diverted approximately 100 million yuan intended for repairing existing buildings to rebuild the power distribution room and convert a corridor into a dormitory. These two projects fall under the scope of basic construction, and such actions violate financial discipline. The hospital also demonstrated significant waste in the project to replace doors and windows in the wards. Some usable doors and windows were also replaced with new ones. The demolition and replacement of doors and windows in wards seven, eight, and nine alone cost over 240 million yuan, some of which could have been avoided. As a result of the hospital's unplanned major repairs and renovations, as of October 1952, it had overspent its approved budget by over 270 million yuan. To cover the overspending, the hospital even misappropriated funds intended for purchasing medical equipment, furniture, and supplies. The hospital frequently resorted to falsely reporting, over-claiming, and inflating expenses to take advantage of the state. On October 21, 1952, the hospital submitted a budget for purchasing two X-ray machines, even though it already had five X-ray machines, which were sufficient for the hospital's needs. To justify buying new X-ray machines, the hospital claimed that three of the existing machines were broken, but upon inspection, only one small machine was broken, while the rest were functioning properly. The hospital already had an old telephone switchboard that could be used with minor repairs, but in 1952, it sought to purchase a new telephone switchboard, requiring 100 million yuan. There were many similar instances.
    The Financial Inspection Group of the Central Ministry of Finance discovered the aforementioned violations of financial discipline at the North China People's Hospital. The hospital's director, Dai Bo, and deputy director, Yan Rong, were not sincerely remorseful about their errors and even engaged in obfuscation and resisted inspection. To resolve the issues at the hospital, the Financial Inspection Group of the Central Ministry of Finance consulted with the Central Ministry of Health several times. Under the supervision of the Central Ministry of Health, the North China People's Hospital finally submitted some explanatory materials, but many of them were fabricated. The Central Ministry of Health then sent personnel to the North China People's Hospital, pointing out that the explanatory materials they submitted were inconsistent with the facts and urging the hospital's leaders to rewrite their written self-criticisms. Only then did the North China People's Hospital reluctantly offer a self-criticism. However, they made no self-criticism regarding their incorrect attitude of resisting financial inspection.
    Most of the errors discovered at the hospital occurred after the "Three-Anti" campaign. Even after the Financial Inspection Group of the Central Ministry of Finance investigated and exposed these errors, the hospital's leaders, Dai Bo and Yan Rong, still did not have a good understanding of their mistakes and continued to maintain a confrontational attitude. This egregious behavior cannot be tolerated. The Central Ministry of Health should not only order them to conduct a profound self-criticism but also impose appropriate disciplinary actions.

### 中央卫生部所属华北人民医院  忽视基本建设假报预算多领国家资金

    中央卫生部所属华北人民医院
    忽视基本建设假报预算多领国家资金
    中央人民政府卫生部所属华北人民医院，不重视基本建设工程，不遵守国家预算制度，使大量国家资金遭受损失。一九五一年五月间，中央卫生部指示华北人民医院在原有基础上增设二百张结核病床。这项任务要在一九五一年十二月或一九五二年一月间完成。该院即根据任务，提出基本建设（盖房子）和购买医疗器械与用具设备的预算七十一亿余元，当年拨款六十五亿八千余万元（基本建设款基本上已拨齐），余款（购医疗器械）一九五二年七月拨齐。但该院领导干部忽视基本建设工作，以致计划不周，几次改变设计，直到去年九月才把房子修好，但到去年十二月，还没有把新病床设立起来。这不仅造成国家建设资金的大量积压，也使许多肺结核病患者不能早日入院。该院不经上级批准，擅自将修补房屋费约一亿元，挪用来重建配电室，并把一幢走廊改为宿舍，这两项工程系属基本建设范围，这样作是违反财政纪律的。该院在更换病房门窗的工程上，也有严重的浪费现象。有些可使用的门窗也换了新的。仅七、八、九病房拆换门窗，即化费二亿四千余万元，其中有些是可以不化的。该院不按计划大修大补的结果，截至一九五二年十月份统计，已超支核定预算达二亿七千余万元。为了弥补超支数，该院竟挪用了购买医疗器械、家具、设备的费用。该院经常采取假报、多领、多报销的办法占国家的便宜。一九五二年十月二十一日该院提出购买X光机两架的预算，其实原有五架X光机，已够该院用了。该院为了买新的X光机，就说原有的X光机坏了三架，但经检查结果，仅一架小型机是坏的，其余都没有坏。该院原有旧电话交换机一台，只要稍加修理即可使用，但一九五二年又要买电话交换机，需款一亿元。类似事情还有很多。
    中央财政部财政检查组发觉了华北人民医院上述违反财政纪律的行为，该院院长戴波、副院长严荣对错误事实还不虚心检讨，并且搅来搅去，抗拒检查。为了解决该院问题，中央财政部财政检查组曾数次与中央卫生部洽商。华北人民医院在中央卫生部的督促下，才提出了若干说明材料，但其中有许多是无中生有的。中央卫生部又派员到华北人民医院，指出他们提出的说明材料不符事实，并督促院的领导干部重作书面检讨。至此，华北人民医院才勉强作了检讨。但对抗拒财政检查的不正确态度，却未做半点检讨。
    该院被检查出的错误，大部分发生在“三反”运动以后。直到中央财政部财政检查组检查揭发出来，该院领导干部戴波、严荣还没有很好的认识，并且继续持对抗态度，这种恶劣行为是不能容忍的。中央卫生部不仅应令他们作深刻检讨，并应予以适当的处分。
