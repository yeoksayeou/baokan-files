    The Northeast Administrative Committee's Financial and Economic Committee recently inspected the technical education work of construction workers' winter training in five units including the Shenyang First, Second, and Third Engineering Companies, and put forward specific opinions on how to improve technical learning during winter training. Some of these five units were preparing to transition to technical education, some had already begun teaching technical courses, and some had already finished. Based on political study, workers have a very urgent need for technical learning. However, some workers also had concerns when entering technical education. Older skilled workers were mainly afraid of increased labor quotas and too much work; some older workers expressed skepticism about advanced experience and were willing to study technical theory. Young workers and apprentices wanted to learn everything and become skilled workers all at once, and were unwilling to specialize in one skill.

    The content and requirements of technical education in the aforementioned units also varied. Some units first studied blueprints, material calculations, and material properties, and then learned advanced experience, operating procedures, quality standards, etc. Some units first studied technical theory, then learned advanced experience, and finally learned technical safety regulations, responsibility systems, etc. Still other units only learned operating procedures, quality standards, technical safety, etc., and did not learn advanced experience at all. In terms of time spent learning advanced experience, some units planned three weeks, and some units planned two weeks. In terms of teaching organization, some units formed teams according to related trades, with skilled workers and apprentices mixed in classes; some units formed independent teams according to trade, and when learning technical theory, formed classes according to technical level, and when learning advanced experience, formed groups with workers and apprentices mixed; some units formed teams according to trade and classes according to technical level. In addition, there were many questions about how to make the technical education plan truly meet actual needs. Some units relied solely on technicians to formulate plans, and administrative leaders did not intervene, so that inappropriate aspects could not be corrected in a timely manner.

    Based on the above situation, the Northeast Financial and Economic Committee put forward the following opinions on the content of technical education and teaching organization:

    I. First of all, ideological mobilization work for technical learning should be done well, workers should be mobilized to discuss the technical education plan, workers' opinions should be synthesized, and necessary supplements and revisions should be made to the plan so that it becomes a program of action to mobilize workers to actively participate in technical learning. At the same time, appropriate encouragement and criticism should be carried out according to the workers' ideological situation. However, ideological mobilization work should be combined with technical education work. It is inappropriate for some units to conduct a week of ideological mobilization in isolation when workers do not yet know the specific plan for technical education.

    II. The curriculum of technical education should generally place basic technical theoretical knowledge combined with practical operation in the forefront, which requires determining its content, requirements, and time according to the different trades and technical levels. For example, the proportion of basic technical theoretical knowledge courses should be less for bricklayers and plasterers, and more for concrete workers, carpenters, and electricians; more for senior workers of each trade, and less for junior workers. When formulating curriculum content, it is necessary to start from the workers' existing technical level and fully consider the opinions of various trades and technical workers. After the above courses are completed, advanced experience in each trade should be learned. The learning of advanced experience should be combined with the quality standards and operating procedures of each trade. This combination of the three courses should be the focus of technical education content. Therefore, it is necessary to prevent and correct two erroneous practices: First, some technicians pay too much attention to the education of basic technical theoretical knowledge when compiling teaching materials, and put the learning of advanced experience in a secondary position. Second, when learning this course, the focus is not on how to enable the vast majority of workers or even all workers to understand and use it, but on developing the inventive and creative talents of individuals, or because they have made certain improvements in the process of promoting advanced experience, they adopt a negative attitude towards the original advanced experience. In addition, the scope of application of advanced experience should be consistent. The advanced experiences pointed out at the 1952 Northeast Basic Construction Advanced Producer Representative Conference must be included in the scope of promotion; some advanced experiences within the scope of a city or an engineering company can also be included in the education plan on the principle that they are indeed likely to be promoted. Other courses such as technical safety regulations, labor discipline, and the responsibility system can finally be taught to workers in the form of reports and by summarizing the work of the past year and putting forward new requirements for this year, using concrete examples, so that they can gradually establish the habit of consciously observing labor discipline and the concept of completing national plans. The administrative side should use this summary to revise and supplement existing rules and regulations, or to establish new rules and regulations. The total study time should not exceed four weeks.

    III. In order to ensure that winter training technical education achieves the expected results, the general requirements should be: (1) The advanced experience of each trade should be understood and used by the workers of each trade. Technical workers who already know how to use it should further improve their proficiency and reform unreasonable labor organization. (2) Some workers should be mobilized in a planned way to "specialize in one and also do another," learning one type of technology in a similar trade to completely or partially solve the imbalance between various trades, but this should not be universally advocated. (3) After the technical education plan is completed, the technical level of workers should be generally raised by one level in the skills testing.

    IV. Teaching organization: Teaching organization must conform to the requirements of teaching content and appropriately create conditions for future construction. But the latter is secondary and should not be done at the expense of the teaching requirements. According to the above teaching content, when learning basic technical theoretical knowledge, generally teams should be divided by trade, and then classes should be divided by technical level within the team, so that technical workers of all levels can obtain corresponding gains (for individual trades where the proportion of theoretical courses is very small, the requirements of the next type of course can be used to organize). When learning advanced experience and quality standards and operating procedures, teams should be organized in a mixed manner regardless of technical level, and groups should be formed within the team in the form of advanced production groups. Special trades with very few people, such as chimney workers, waterproofing workers, and sheet metal workers, can be organized into teams and classes of trades similar to them, but they must be separate research groups, should have a curriculum schedule, and be assigned certain personnel to guide their learning to prevent self-study without guidance.

    In addition, the Northeast Financial and Economic Committee also suggested that the planning committees, construction engineering bureaus, and construction departments of each province and city in the Northeast, under the unified leadership of the local Party committee, seize the opportunity to check the progress of winter training technical education and require that the following problems be effectively resolved:

    I. Quickly formulate specific technical education plans that are closely integrated with reality. Leaders of each competent department must personally preside over the review and approval. If the plan has been drafted, it should be carefully studied again and discussed by the workers to make necessary supplements or revisions. The content of the plan should be determined according to the needs of the engineering tasks of each unit, and special trades should be cultivated in a planned way.

    II. Textbook issues. After each trade has basic teaching materials, several types should be compiled according to the technical requirements of each trade, and technical teachers should be involved in this work.

    III. Properly solve the teacher problem. In addition to being technically competent, teachers should also have the following conditions: (1) They must have the view of consciously serving construction workers, so that they can go deep into the masses, seriously absorb the opinions of workers, and learn from workers. (2) Teachers should accept advanced experience without reservation in their thinking, so that they can explain it without reservation and actively promote it. (3) The teaching method should be flexible, using vivid examples to illustrate problems and talking less about general principles. For this reason, a special person should be designated to help teachers prepare lessons, and at the same time, teachers should be organized to conduct trial lectures.

    IV. Appropriately and quickly resolve the procurement of tools, appliances, various models, as well as red bricks, sand, and stones needed in teaching.

    东北财政经济委员会检查冬训工作提出关于技术教育内容和教学编制的意见
    东北行政委员会财政经济委员会最近检查了沈阳市第一、第二、第三工程公司等五个单位的建筑工人冬训技术教育工作，对如何搞好冬训技术学习提出了具体意见。这五个单位有的正准备转入技术教育，有的已开始讲授技术课程，有的已经结束。在政治学习的基础上，工人对技术学习的要求都很迫切。但在进入技术教育时，部分工人也有过顾虑。老技术工人主要是怕劳动定额提高，工作太累；有的老工人对先进经验表示怀疑，愿意学习技术理论。青年工人和徒工，是样样都想学，想一下变成个技术工人，不愿意专学一门技术。
    上述单位技术教育的内容和要求也各不相同。有的单位先学图纸、工料计算、材料性能，后学先进经验、操作规程、质量标准等。有的单位先学技术理论，再学先进经验，最后才学技术保安规程、责任制等。还有的单位只学操作规程、质量标准、技术保安等，根本不学先进经验。在学习先进经验的时间上，有的单位计划为三星期，有的单位计划为两星期。在教学编制方面，有的单位按有联系的工种编队，技术工人和徒工混合编班；有的单位按工种独立编队，在学习技术理论时，按技术等级编班，在学习先进经验时，工人学徒混合编成小组；有的单位按工种编队，按技术等级编班。此外，关于如何使技术教育计划真正符合实际需要也有很多问题。有的单位仅靠技术人员制订计划，行政领导干部不过问，以致其中不恰当的地方不能及时纠正。
    根据上述情况，东北财政经济委员会对技术教育的内容和教学编制，提出了以下几点意见：
    一、首先应做好技术学习的思想动员工作，发动工人讨论技术教育计划，综合工人的意见，对计划作必要的补充和修改，使它成为动员工人积极参加技术学习的行动纲领。同时，应根据工人思想情况，进行适当的鼓励和批判。但是，思想动员工作应该和技术教育工作结合进行，有些单位孤立地进行了一个星期的思想动员，工人还不知道技术教育的具体计划，这是不妥当的。
    二、技术教育的课程，一般应将技术理论基础知识结合实际操作放在前面进行，这需要按工种及技术等级的不同，确定它的内容、要求和时间。如技术理论基础知识课程的比重，对瓦工抹灰工等应少些，对混凝土工、木工、电工等应多些；对各工种的高级工应多些，对低级工即应少些。制订课程内容时，必须从工人现有技术水平出发，并应充分考虑各工种和各级技术工人的意见。上述课程学完以后，即应学习各工种的先进经验。先进经验的学习应结合各工种的质量标准和操作规程进行。这三者相结合的课程，应是技术教育内容的重点。因此，要防止和纠正两种错误做法：第一，某些技术人员在编制教材时，过多地注意技术理论基础知识的教育，而把学习先进经验摆在次要地位。第二，在学习这一课程时，不是如何使绝大多数工人以至全体工人学懂、会用，而是在发挥个别人的发明创造才能，或者由于自己在推行先进经验当中又有了某些改进，便对原来的先进经验采取否定的态度。此外，采用先进经验的范围应求得一致。一九五二年东北基本建设先进生产者代表会议上所指出的那些先进经验，一定要列在推广的范围内；属于一个城市或一个工程公司范围内的某些先进经验，在确有把握推广的原则下，也可列入教育计划。其他课程如技术保安规程、劳动纪律、责任制等，在最后可采取报告形式和通过总结去年的工作和提出今年新的要求，以具体事例向工人进行教育，使能逐步树立起自觉地遵守劳动纪律的习惯及完成国家计划的观念。行政方面应通过这一总结来修改、补充已有的规程和制度，或订立新的规程和制度。全部学习时间，以不超过四周为宜。
    三、为了保证冬训技术教育达到预期效果，总的要求应是：（一）各工种的先进经验都应被各工种的工人学懂、会用。原来就会运用的技术工人，应进一步做到熟练，并要改革不合理的劳动组织。（二）有计划地动员部分工人“专一门、兼一门”，多学会相近工种的一种技术，使能全部或部分解决各工种间的不平衡问题，但不应普遍号召。（三）在技术教育计划完成以后，要使工人的技术等级在考工中能够普遍提高一级。
    四、教学编制：教学编制必须服从教学内容的要求，并适当地为日后施工创造条件。但后者是次要的，不能为了它而不利于教学的要求。按照上述教学内容，在学习技术理论基础知识时，一般地应按工种分队，再在队下按技术等级分班，以便使各级技术工人都能得到相适应的收获（个别工种理论课程比重很小者，可按下一种课程要求来编制）。在学习先进经验和质量标准、操作规程时，应不分技术等级混合编队，并在队内按先进生产小组的形式编组。人数很少的特殊工种，如烟囱工、防水工、白铁工等，可组织到与之相近的工种的队和班里去，但他们必须是单独的研究小组，应有课程进度计划，并派一定人员指导其学习，防止自流。
    此外，东北财政经济委员会并建议东北各省、市计划委员会、建筑工程局及各施工部门，在当地党委统一领导下，抓紧检查一次冬训技术教育进行情况，并要求切实解决下列问题：
    一、迅速制订具体的与实际密切结合的技术教育计划。各主管部门领导人必须亲自主持审定。如果计划已拟定，应再仔细研究并经工人讨论，作必要的补充或修改。计划内容，要根据各单位工程任务的需要来确定，对特殊工种要有计划地加以培养。
    二、教材问题。每一工种有了基本教材后，应按各工种的技术要求分编若干种，并应吸收技术教员参加这一工作。
    三、妥善地解决教员问题。教员除要求在技术上能胜任外，还应具备如下条件：（一）要有自觉地为建筑工人服务的观点，这样才能深入群众认真吸收工人的意见，并向工人学习。（二）教员在思想上要无保留地接受先进经验，这样才能无保留地讲解它，积极推广它。（三）教学方式要灵活，多用生动实例说明问题，少讲一般道理。为此，应指定专人帮助教员备课，同时，应组织教员进行试讲。
    四、适当地迅速地解决教学中需要的工具、器具、各类模型，以及红砖、砂、石等的采购等问题。
