Responses to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions to the People's Daily

    Central Ministry of Agriculture Issues Circular Calling on All Regions to Strengthen the Prevention and Control of Animal Plague

    People's Daily Readers' Letters Group: The "Reader's Letter Review" titled "Leadership Departments in Various Regions Should Attach Importance to the Serious Situation of Deaths of Draught Animals" was published in the "Reader's Letters" column on January 15th. Our ministry fully agrees with the suggestions regarding strengthening the prevention and control of animal plague. On January 27th, our ministry issued a circular, hoping that the agricultural and animal husbandry departments in various regions will pay special attention to this issue and earnestly carry out the following tasks: 1. Immediately inspect the recent deaths of draught animals in the local area, find out the causes, and implement effective prevention methods. 2. Organize local veterinary workers and propaganda personnel to vigorously publicize common knowledge of animal plague prevention to the peasant masses, educating farmers to improve feeding management and livestock hygiene work. 3. Strictly implement all emergency prevention and control measures in epidemic areas.

    Materials Supply Bureau of the Ministry of Railways Corrects the Shortcomings in Improper Use of Technical Personnel

    People's Daily Readers' Letters Group: On December 26, 1952, the "Reader's Letters" column of the People's Daily published a letter from reader Hou Xinghua criticizing our bureau for improperly using technical personnel. We attached great importance to this criticism and immediately held a meeting for careful study and discussion. On January 3rd, we specifically convened a symposium of technical cadres in our unit to solicit their opinions.

    As Comrade Hou Xinghua pointed out: We do have shortcomings in the use of technical personnel. For example, some civil engineers are now responsible for the distribution and supply of metal materials, engineering technicians are responsible for the supply of material plans, and those who originally studied physics and chemistry are in charge of the distribution and supply of materials such as cement and explosives; this cannot enable technical cadres to fully play their due role. Because we still have departmentalism thinking and lack an overall concept, this unreasonable phenomenon has occurred and cannot be corrected in a timely manner. In addition, we have not planned to train a group of graduating students from Jiaotong University who were assigned to our department for internship, so that they can gradually reach the level of being able to solve technical problems with materials, which is also incorrect.

    Now, the Personnel Bureau of the Ministry of Railways has adjusted some of the technical cadres of our bureau to work in the new line engineering department, and all the graduate interns from Jiaotong University have been assigned to railway factories for internships.

    Finally, it should be pointed out that Comrade Hou Xinghua believes that managing material work is merely general clerical work such as copying forms and calculating accounts, which is incorrect. The supply of materials must be combined with technology, which has been fully proven by years of work experience. In the future, the railway department's capital construction tasks will be heavy, and the required materials will be supplied by the material department. The types, properties, and specifications of these materials all need to be identified by various technical personnel.

    People's Government of Fuliang County, Jiangxi Province, Corrects the Mistake of Neglecting Forest Protection

    Comrade Editor: The criticism made by Comrades Zhao Deming and Zhou Junsong in the "Reader's Letters" column on December 26th regarding our county's neglect of forest protection is completely correct, and we sincerely accept it. This criticism has played a significant role in strengthening our forest protection work in the future. In the past, our county did not attach enough importance to forest protection work. Although there was also an organization of the Forest Protection Committee, it did not seriously carry out propaganda and education work among the masses to organize the masses to consciously protect the forests. Therefore, the situation of the masses near Baitashan arbitrarily burning and reclaiming mountain forests, causing damage to national resources, occurred.

    In order to correct the past mistakes and earnestly do a good job in forest protection in the future, our county's Agricultural and Forestry Section convened a joint meeting of the heads of the eight townships near Baitashan and the chairmen of the township peasant associations. At the meeting, each township reported and inspected the past forest protection work, and studied and arranged the future forest protection work: 1. Improve the forest protection organizations at all levels, establish forest protection committees in each township, and establish forest protection groups and joint fire-fighting teams in each village. 2. Each township is responsible for conducting extensive and in-depth publicity to the masses, prohibiting burning and reclamation, and designating Baitashan as a mountain closure afforestation area. 3. Establish a meeting system and a reporting system for inspecting forest protection work.

    In addition, we also convened a meeting of the heads of all forty-seven townships in the county to inspect and arrange forest protection work.

    对人民日报读者批评建议的反应
    中央农业部发出通报号召各地加强防治兽疫工作
    人民日报社读者来信组：一月十五日“读者来信”栏发表了“各地领导部门应重视耕畜死亡的严重情况”的“读者来信述评”。其中关于加强防治兽疫工作的建议，我部完全同意。一月二十七日，我部已发出通报，希望各地农业畜牧部门特别重视这个问题，并认真作好下列几项工作：一，立即检查当地最近耕畜死亡情形及其原因，并施行有效的防止办法。二，组织当地兽医工作者和宣传工作人员大力向农民群众宣传预防兽疫的常识，教育农民改善饲养管理和牲畜卫生工作。三，对于疫区应严格实施一切紧急防治措施。

    铁道部材料供应局已纠正使用技术人材不当的缺点
    人民日报读者来信组：一九五二年十二月二十六日人民日报“读者来信”栏发表了读者侯兴华对我局使用技术人材不得当的批评信。我们十分重视这个批评，当即开会进行慎重的研究和讨论。一月三日，我们又专门召开了一次本单位技术干部座谈会征求他们的意见。
    正如侯兴华同志所指出的：我们在使用技术人材方面是有缺点的。如有的土木工程师现在担任金属材料的分配供应工作，工程技术人员担任材料计划的供应工作，原来学理化的掌握洋灰、爆炸物等材料的分配供应工作等；这就不能使技术干部充分发挥他们应有的作用。因为我们还有着本位主义思想，缺乏整体观念，所以发生了这种不合理的现象，并且不能及时纠正。此外，我们对这次分配到本部门实习的一部分交通大学毕业学生，也没有有计划地培养他们逐渐达到能够解决材料上的技术问题的水平，这也是不对的。
    现在铁道部人事局已把我局一部分技术干部调整到新线工程部门工作，并把交通大学毕业实习生一律分配到铁路工厂实习。
    最后，应该指出：侯兴华同志认为管理材料工作仅仅是抄表报、打算盘等一般事务性的工作，这个意见是不正确的。材料供应工作必须和技术相结合，这是几年来的工作经验所充分证明了的。今后铁路部门基本建设任务繁重，所需材料都由材料部门负责供应，而这些材料的种类、性能、规格等都是需要各种技术人员加以鉴定的。

    江西省浮梁县人民政府纠正忽视护林工作的错误
    编辑同志：去年十二月二十六日“读者来信”栏发表的赵德铭、周俊松两同志对我县忽视护林工作的批评是完全正确的，我们诚恳接受。这个批评对我们今后加强护林工作起了很大的作用。过去我县对护林工作的重视是很不够的，虽然也有护林委员会的组织，但却没有认真向群众进行宣传教育工作，组织群众自觉起来护林。因此，就发生了白塔山附近群众随意烧垦山林，使国家资源遭到损失的情况。
    为了纠正过去的错误，今后切实做好护林工作，我县农林科召开了白塔山附近八个乡的乡长和乡农民协会主席的联席会议。会上各乡汇报、检查了过去的护林工作，并研究、布置了今后的护林工作：一、健全各级护林组织，各乡设立护林委员会，各村成立护林小组及联防打火队。二、各乡负责对群众进行广泛而深入的宣传，禁止烧垦开荒，划白塔山为封山育林区。三、建立检查护林工作的会议制度和汇报制度。
    此外，我们并召开了全县四十七个乡的乡长会议，检查、布置了护林工作。
