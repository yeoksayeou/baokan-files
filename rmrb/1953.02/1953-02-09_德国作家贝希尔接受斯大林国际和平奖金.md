Xinhua News Agency dispatch:

    The award ceremony for the "Strengthening International Peace" Stalin International Prize to the distinguished peace fighter and German writer Johannes Becher was held in Moscow on the 4th. Academician Skobeltsyn, Chairman of the "Strengthening International Peace" Stalin International Prize Committee, presented the gold medal and certificate to Becher. In his congratulatory speech, Skobeltsyn emphasized that his congratulations to Becher were also congratulations to all German democratic intellectuals who are struggling to defend peace and oppose the threat of war. He expressed his hope that Becher and all the German people would succeed in the struggle to defend peace and strive for Germany's reunification as a unified, peace-loving, and democratic country.

    In his acceptance speech, Becher said that he considered the awarding of the Stalin International Prize to him as the highest commendation to the German peace movement and to the German people who tirelessly work to maintain peace and for their motherland. Becher quoted Stalin as saying: "The people of the two countries, Germany and the Soviet Union, possess the greatest potential in Europe to accomplish great actions of world importance. As long as the people of these two countries show determination to fight for peace as diligently as they did during the war, then peace in Europe can be considered guaranteed." He then emphasized that the ability of the entire German nation must be used to build a unified, peace-loving, and truly humanitarian Germany as Stalin pointed out. This new humanitarian Germany has been realized in the German Democratic Republic, and in the western part of my motherland, millions of Germans feel that they are firmly connected with this peace-loving Germany.

    After exposing the plots of the American and British aggressors against Germany, Becher expressed his gratitude to the Soviet people who liberated his motherland from the rule of Hitler fascism. Becher finally declared that the German people need peace. They not only yearn for peace, but are also determined to create conditions for peace in their own country in order to live in peace with the people of all countries and establish a unified, peace-loving Germany.

    德国作家贝希尔接受斯大林国际和平奖金
    据新华社讯：以“加强国际和平”斯大林国际奖金授予卓越的和平战士、德国作家约翰尼斯·贝希尔的典礼于四日在莫斯科举行。 “加强国际和平”斯大林国际奖金委员会主席、科学院院士斯科贝尔琴将金质奖章和奖状授予贝希尔。斯科贝尔琴在致贺词时着重指出，他祝贺贝希尔，就是祝贺所有为保卫和平与反对战争威胁而奋斗的德国民主知识分子。他希望贝希尔和全体德国人民在保卫和平与争取德国重新成为一个统一的、爱好和平的民主国家的斗争中获得成功。
    贝希尔在致答词时说，他认为把斯大林国际奖金授予他，是对德国的和平运动、对那些不倦地为维护和平并为他们的祖国而工作的德国人民的最崇高的褒奖。贝希尔引用斯大林的话说：德苏“两国人民在欧洲拥有最大的潜力，以完成有世界重要性的伟大行动。只要这两国人民表现决心为和平而战，像他们在战争时那样努力，那末和平在欧洲可以认为有了保证。”他接着强调指出：德国全民族的能力，必须用于建立一个像斯大林所指出的统一的、爱好和平的、真正人道主义的德国。这个新的人道主义的德国已在德意志民主共和国实现，在我的祖国的西部，千百万德国人都感觉到他们和这个爱好和平的德国牢固地联系在一起。
    贝希尔在揭露了美英侵略者对德国的阴谋之后，对把他的祖国从希特勒法西斯主义统治下解放出来的苏联人民表示感谢。贝希尔最后宣称，德国人民需要和平。他们不仅向往和平，而且决心要在他们自己的国内创造和平的条件，以便与各国人民和平共处并建立一个爱好和平的统一的德国。
