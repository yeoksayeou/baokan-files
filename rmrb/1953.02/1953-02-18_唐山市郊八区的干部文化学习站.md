Tangshan's eighth district has a branch of the city's Cadre Spare-time Cultural School.

The eighth district is a suburban area with a total of fifty-six villages. Beizi Yuan is where the district people's government is located, and district committees, public security sub-bureaus, district cooperatives, health stations, and other agencies are also concentrated here. However, the six police stations of the public security sub-bureau and several outlets of the district cooperative are scattered outside. Due to work needs, the mobility of cadres is also very high. For example, the district committee's work teams often go down on Mondays and return to the district on Saturdays. Other departments, such as the cooperative and tax office cadres, go to market, and public security sub-bureau cadres conduct fieldwork, all of which require mobility. When there is urgent work, almost all cadres in the district have to go down to the villages.

Of the district's one hundred-plus cadres, the educational levels are very uneven, ranging from illiterate to junior high school level. Many people are transferred from the city and are accustomed to more formal cultural learning. They are very dissatisfied with completely scattered self-study or, like in general counties and districts, only listening to the teacher for one day on "study day" to finish six or seven days' worth of lessons. However, the district only has one teacher. In the beginning, classes were concentrated in Beizi Yuan, and the students reflected: "It's really tiring to travel twenty or thirty li back and forth a day." In this way, both work and study suffer. Some people also said: "Don't assign me to work in the district, once I get to the district, my studies are over."

The Propaganda Department of the District Committee and Comrade Wang Fengming, the cultural teacher, in order to solve the cultural learning problems of all cadres in the district, established learning stations based on the principle of "decentralized teaching, centralized leadership." The method is: to establish fixed learning stations in places where agencies are relatively concentrated and there are larger-scale complete primary schools nearby. A total of three learning stations were set up in the district. In areas far from the district and without agencies, temporary learning stations were set up to facilitate the learning of cadres in the work teams going to the countryside. Currently, a total of one hundred and thirty-seven cadres are participating in learning station studies, divided into five classes (including one junior high school class). There are four days of cultural classes and two days of current affairs and politics classes each week. Each day has two classes, totaling ninety minutes. Classes are generally held early in the morning (because work in the countryside is mostly carried out in the evening). In addition to one full-time teacher, the teaching is also done by primary school teachers from each learning station, with a current total of fourteen part-time teachers. The teaching progress of each station is completely unified. Cadres can study wherever they go, and the content of the study is precisely connected. Since the establishment of the learning stations, each station has been able to persist in holding classes every day. The attendance rate and homework submission rate of students have reached over 80%. The cadres are very happy, and everyone said: Before the learning station was established, sometimes work was busy and they couldn't go to the district school to attend classes, and their homework would fall behind; after the learning station was established, this problem was solved.

The Eighth District has the following experiences in running learning stations:

1.  The Party Committee's emphasis is the key to running the learning station well. For example, the District Committee studied methods and established learning stations to solve the cultural learning problems of cadres in the suburbs. Comrade Lie Dong, the Secretary of the District Committee, mobilized the cadres and said: "You must study when you work in the agency, and you must study when you go down to work. You must study wherever you go." Sun Zhemin, the Minister of the Propaganda Department, mobilized thirty-eight part-time teachers to participate in the work of the learning station and often reviewed the teachers' lesson preparation notes. Li Xiangqian, the Deputy Minister of the Propaganda Department, often got up early to attend classes and went to the agency to check on the attendance of the students. Also, the District Committee often instructed various agencies and departments not to neglect the cadres' learning when assigning cadres to go to the countryside. In addition, the District Committee can also actively solve the material difficulties of each learning station, such as mobilizing various departments to free up some tables and chairs for the district school (station).

2.  To run the cultural learning station well, it is also necessary to strengthen organizational leadership and establish a rigorous teaching system. In addition to setting up class leaders and agency learning groups to strengthen the supervision and inspection of learning, the learning station also stipulates the following systems: (1) Learning introduction letter system. That is, before the work team or individual goes down to the countryside to work, the team leader or individual obtains a learning introduction letter from the district cultural teacher (stating the grade and learning progress). And hand it over to the person in charge of the learning station that evening, so that each subject teacher can prepare lessons. (2) Weekly subject progress notification form system. The district will notify each station of the progress of each subject next week, so that part-time teachers can prepare lessons. (3) Make-up class system. From 7:00 to 8:30 pm on Friday night, the entire district will uniformly conduct make-up classes. Those who miss classes will still be counted as attending after making up the classes. (4) Student absence notification system. Every weekend, the district will notify the agency to which the students who have missed too many classes belong. (5) Monthly announcement of student attendance and monthly test scores system. The attendance of cadres in class and the monthly test scores are announced at the meeting, which is highly valued and plays a great role in promoting it. (6) Learning inspection system. Every two weeks, students hold a learning inspection meeting to check their personal learning attitude, teachers' teaching, learning committee, and district school leadership. In addition, for sick leave or leave for personal reasons, a certificate letter must be issued by the head of the agency. The system for enrollment, transfer, withdrawal, examination and promotion, and completion of studies is the same as that stipulated by the general school.

3.  It is necessary to solve the difficulties of teachers and strengthen the relationship between teachers and students. Teachers have many concerns about teaching cadres, especially in suburban branch schools; in the beginning, they often treat cadres as "superiors," fearing that they will say something wrong, and even pour tea and water for cadres when they go to class. The Propaganda Department of the District Committee and the teachers studied the characteristics of the students, called on cadres to "respect teachers and be eager to learn" and "willing to be elementary school students," and took care of the part-time teachers' own business, not allowing them to teach too many classes (no more than three hours a week).

4.  Branch schools must be equipped with one or two full-time cultural teachers who can teach junior high school courses. These teachers must also have the spirit of actively studying and enduring hardships, and they must also integrate with the cadres and part-time teachers participating in the study; otherwise, it is impossible to complete such a complex and arduous cultural teaching task.

### 唐山市郊八区的干部文化学习站

    唐山市郊八区的干部文化学习站
    唐山市八区设有市干部业余文化学校的一个分校。
    八区是一个郊区，全区共有五十六个村庄，碑子院是区人民政府所在地，区委会、公安分局、区合作社、保健站等机关也都集中在这里。但公安分局的六个派出所、区合作社的几个门市部都分散在外面。由于工作需要，干部的流动性也是很大的。如区委的工作组经常在星期一下去，星期六回区；其他部门如合作社、税务所的干部赶集，公安分局的干部搞外勤，都不得不流动。遇到突击工作时，几乎区里所有干部都要下去。
    全区一百多干部，文化程度很不齐，从文盲到初中程度的都有。许多人是从市内调来的，已习惯于较正规的文化学习。对完全分散自修、或像一般县区似地只在“学习日”听教员一天讲完六、七天的课，是很不满意的。但全区只有一个教员，开始时在碑子院集中上课，学员们反映：一天来回跑二、三十里路，真够疲乏的了。这样，工作和学习都弄不好。也有人说：“可别分配到区里工作，一到区，学习就算完了。”
    区委宣传部与文化教员王凤鸣同志为了解决全区干部的文化学习问题，根据“分散教学、集中领导”的方针，建立起学习站来。办法是：在机关比较集中而附近又有规模较大的完全小学的地方成立固定的学习站。全区共设了三个学习站。在离区较远而又没有机关的地方，为了便于下乡工作组的干部学习，又设立临时学习站。现在参加学习站学习的干部共一百三十七人，编为五个班（内有一个初中班）。每周有四天上文化课，两天上时事政治课。每天上两节课，共九十分钟。上课时间，一般都在清早（因在农村进行工作多在晚间）。授课，除设有专任教员一人外，其余皆由各学习站的小学教师兼任，现共有兼任教员十四人。各站教学进度已完全统一。干部走到那里都可以学习，学习内容也正好衔接上。自从学习站成立后，各站每天都能坚持上课。学员的出席率和交作业率都达到百分之八十以上。干部非常高兴，大家说：学习站没成立前，有时工作忙不能到区校上课，功课都拉下了；学习站成立后，这问题可解决了。
    八区在办学习站中，有这样几点经验：
    一、党委的重视是办好学习站的关键。如区委钻研办法，成立学习站以解决郊区干部的文化学习问题。区委书记列东同志动员干部说：“在机关工作时要学习，下去工作时也要学习，走到那里要学到那里。”宣传部长孙哲民同志发动了三十八位兼课教师参加学习站的工作，并经常审阅教员的备课笔记。宣传部副部长李向前同志常起早到班上听课，并去机关检查学员出席情况。又如区委经常指示各机关、部门，在分配干部下乡时，不要忽视干部的学习。此外，区委也能主动地去解决各学习站物质上的困难，如动员各部门给区校（站）腾出些桌椅来。
    二、办好文化学习站，还必须特别加强组织领导，建立一套严密的教学制度。学习站除应设立班长、机关学习小组等以加强学习的督促检查外，还规定了以下的制度：（1）学习介绍信制。即工作组或个人下乡工作前，组长或个人向区文化教员领取学习介绍信（上面写属何年级、学习进度等）。并于当晚交到学习站负责人，以便各科教员备课，
    （2）每周各科进度通知表制。区将下周各科进度通知各站，以便兼课教员备课。（3）补课制。在礼拜五晚七时至八时半，全区各地统一展开补课。缺课者补课后，仍以出席论。（4）学员缺课通知书制。每逢周末区把缺课过多的学员通知其所属机关。（5）每月学员出席情况及月考成绩公布制。把干部上课出席情况及月考成绩在会场公布，大家非常重视，推动作用很大。（6）学习检查制。每两周学员开一次学习检查会，检查个人的学习态度、教师的教学、学委及区校的领导。此外，因病因事请假，须由机关首长开证明信。入学、转学、退学、考试升级、修业等制度与总校规定相同。
    三、要解决教员的困难与密切教师和学员间的关系。教员对教干部是顾虑很多的，尤其在郊区分校里；他们开始往往将干部当成“上司”生怕讲话讲错了，甚至干部去上课，他们还斟茶倒水的。区委宣传部和教员们研究了学员特点，号召干部“尊师好学”“甘当小学生”，并照顾到兼课教员的本身业务，不要使其兼课过多（一周不超过三小时）。
    四、分校必须配备一到两个能教初中课程的专任文化教员，这些教员还要有积极钻研和吃苦耐劳的精神，并要和参加学习的干部与兼课教员打成一片，否则就不可能完成这样复杂艰巨的文化教学任务。
