    Central People's Government Ministry of Education
    Issues Order Commending Shi Xinmin as a "Model People's Teacher"
    The Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government issued a circular on February 13, officially commending Shi Xinmin, a teacher at Baocun Central Primary School in Jing County, Anhui Province, as a "Model People's Teacher." Shi Xinmin, 26 years old, was from Aimin Township, Caoxi District, Jing County. After liberation, through the education of land reform, suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, his ideological consciousness gradually improved. In 1951, he participated in a teacher training class and was assigned to work at Baocun Central Primary School in Jing County in the second half of the same year. Shi Xinmin was consistently responsible in his work, earning the love of students and the masses. On September 19, 1952, he gloriously sacrificed his life while escorting students home, rescuing a student who accidentally fell into the water. After his death, the Jing County People's Government immediately issued a burial fee of 600,000 yuan and held a mass memorial service. After receiving the report, the Anhui Provincial People's Government issued a consolation payment of 4 million yuan to Shi Xinmin's family.
    In the circular, the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government pointed out: Shi Xinmin's deeds of loving children and sacrificing himself in the face of danger fully demonstrate the excellent qualities of a people's teacher and serve as a glorious banner for educational workers, worthy of learning by teachers across the country. The circular also requires the education departments and bureaus of the people's governments of each province and city to publicize and educate middle and primary school teachers on Shi Xinmin's noble qualities of loving children and being loyal to his duties, to achieve the purpose of universally improving teachers' sense of responsibility and improving teaching work.

    明令褒奖施新民为“模范人民教师”
    中央人民政府教育部在二月十三日发出通报，明令褒奖安徽省泾县包村中心小学教师施新民为“模范人民教师”。施新民二十六岁，泾县漕溪区爱民乡人。解放后经过土地改革、镇压反革命、抗美援朝运动的教育，思想觉悟日渐提高。一九五一年，他参加了教师训练班学习，同年下半年分配到泾县包村中心小学工作。施新民工作一贯负责，获得学生和群众的爱戴。一九五二年九月十九日，他在护送学生回家途中，因抢救失足落水的学生而光荣殉职。殉职后，泾县人民政府当即发给安葬费六十万元，并召开群众性的追悼会。安徽省人民政府接到报告后，即发给施新民家属抚恤金四百万元。
    中央人民政府教育部在通报中指出：施新民平时热爱儿童，临危舍身殉职的事迹，集中表现了人民教师的优秀品质，足为教育工作者的光辉旗帜，值得全国各地教师学习。通报并要求各省、市人民政府教育厅、局将施新民热爱儿童忠于职守的崇高品质，在中、小学教师中进行宣传教育，以达到普遍提高教师的责任心和改善教学工作的目的。
