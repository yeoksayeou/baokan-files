Xinhua News Agency, Bandung: On January 30th, the Committee on Industry and Trade of the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East completed the discussion of two agenda items: the issue of transporting industrial equipment, raw materials, and semi-finished products, and the Secretariat's report on efforts to promote trade. The discussions demonstrated the great importance that Asian and Far Eastern countries attach to these issues. Representatives from those countries spoke about the need for their countries to obtain industrial equipment to develop their national industries, but the representatives pointed out that their countries could not do so because the industrial equipment they imported was very expensive, while the raw materials they exported were very cheap.

The Soviet representative, Nemchina, spoke on the first agenda item under discussion. He pointed out that for decades, colonial powers had consistently obstructed the development of national industries in Asian and Far Eastern countries, making those countries perpetually sources of raw materials and markets for colonial powers to sell their goods. Colonial powers and their monopoly capitalist groups exploited the national resources of Asian and Far Eastern countries, using their foreign trade to get rich, while harming the vital interests of the peoples of those countries.

Nemchina cited specific examples to illustrate the deterioration of foreign trade, the increase in trade deficits, and the reduction of currency reserves in many Asian and Far Eastern countries in 1951-52. In the first six months of 1951, the trade deficit of those countries was estimated at approximately $675 million. As a result of buying manufactured goods from the United States at high prices and selling raw materials to the United States at low prices, Asian and Far Eastern countries' trade deficit with the United States reached $235 million in the first six months of 1952. During the same period, the trade deficit with Britain reached $132 million.

The Soviet representative said that the United States, for its own selfish imperialist purposes, obstructed the development of trade with democratic countries by illegally implementing embargoes and blockades, which also had a very harmful impact on the foreign trade of Asian and Far Eastern countries. The United States forced Asian and Far Eastern countries to drastically reduce their trade with the People's Republic of China, thereby destroying traditional trade relations. The United States disintegrated the economies and foreign trade of those countries, making them particularly vulnerable to various speculations and market fluctuations in the world market.

The Soviet representative drew attention to the fact that the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East had not expressed opposition to the trade blockade against the People's Republic of China implemented by the United States and other colonial powers, while the task of the Economic Commission was precisely to support and strengthen economic relations between Asian and Far Eastern countries and other countries in the world.

Nemchina further pointed out that the United States and Britain had not supplied Asian and Far Eastern countries with the machinery they needed to develop their national industries in the past, and are now reducing their machinery exports to those countries.

The Soviet representative concluded by saying that the United States and other suzerain states are attempting to make those countries perpetually markets for selling their goods by reducing the shipment of basic equipment to Asian and Far Eastern countries. The Soviet Union believes that economic relations and trade with Asian and Far Eastern countries should be arranged in a manner that promotes the development of national industries and agriculture in those countries. Expanding business relations with each other and with other countries based on the principles of equal rights, respect for sovereignty, and mutual benefit is the most important condition for the smooth development of trade in those countries. The Soviet Union is ready to expand trade with Asian and Far Eastern countries, and is ready to transport industrial equipment, machinery, and other goods needed for the development of industry, transportation, and agriculture to those countries, in exchange for the goods that those countries have always exported, thereby promoting the economic development of those countries.

Indonesian newspapers reported on the work of the committee at length, especially the speech of the Soviet representative. The Indonesian "People's Daily" published an editorial saying: "The statement of the Soviet representative is of great importance to the Indonesian people, because it is in line with the demands of the Indonesian people. The Indonesian people have experienced everything that the Soviet representative said... The Indonesian people have felt how difficult it is to establish a sound national economy when their national resources are controlled and monopolized by foreign capitalist groups."

    在联合国亚洲暨远东经济委员会的工业与贸易委员会上
    苏联代表揭露殖民国家掠夺政策
    苏联准备用工业设备等帮助亚洲各国发展经济
    【新华社三日讯】据塔斯社万隆讯：一月三十日，联合国亚洲暨远东经济委员会的工业与贸易委员会已经把两项议程讨论完毕，这两项议程是：运送工业设备、原料和半制成品的问题，和秘书处关于努力促进贸易的报告书。讨论经过表明了亚洲和远东各国对这些问题非常重视。那些国家的代表们谈到他们的国家需要得到工业设备以发展他们的民族工业，但是，发言的代表们指出，他们的国家不能这么办，因为他们输入的工业设备价格很高，而他们输出的原料价格很低。
    苏联代表涅姆钦纳就讨论中的第一项议程发言。他指出：几十年来殖民国家始终阻挠亚洲和远东各国民族工业的发展，使那些国家永远是原料产地和殖民国家推销货物的市场。殖民国家和它的垄断资本集团榨取亚洲和远东各国的国家资源，利用他们的对外贸易发财，而损害那些国家各族人民的切身利益。
    涅姆钦纳举出具体例子，说明许多亚洲及远东国家在一九五一—五二年的对外贸易的恶化、入超的增加和货币准备金的减少。一九五一年头六个月中，那些国家的贸易入超估计约为六亿七千五百万美元。由于用高价向美国购买制成品、并用低价向美国卖出原料的结果，亚洲和远东各国一九五二年头六个月的对美贸易入超达二亿三千五百万美元。同期对英贸易入超达一亿三千二百万美元。
    苏联代表说：美国为了自私自利的帝国主义目的，用非法实行禁运和封锁的方法，妨碍和民主世界各国贸易的发展，这也使亚洲和远东各国的对外贸易受到极有害的影响。美国强制亚洲和远东各国激减对中华人民共和国的贸易，从而破坏传统的贸易关系。美国使那些国家的经济和对外贸易解体，使它们特别容易受到世界市场上的种种投机倒把和行情波动的打击。
    苏联代表唤起大家注意这个事实：亚洲暨远东经济委员会还没有表示反对美国和其他殖民国家实施的对中华人民共和国的贸易封锁，而经济委员会的任务正是在于支持并加强亚洲和远东各国与世界其他各国之间的经济关系。
    涅姆钦纳进一步指出：美英过去没有供给亚洲和远东各国以他们发展民族工业所需要的机器，现在并在减少对那些国家的机器输出。
    苏联代表最后说：美国和其他宗主国用减少运送基本设备给亚洲和远东各国的方法，企图使那些国家永远成为推销它们的货物的市场。苏联认为：和亚洲及远东各国的经济关系和贸易，应该用可以促进那些国家的民族工业和农业发展的态度来加以安排。根据平等权利、尊重主权和互惠的原则，扩大相互间以及和其他国家之间的商务关系，这是顺利发展和那些国家贸易的一个最重要的条件。苏联准备和亚洲及远东各国扩大贸易，准备把工业设备、机器以及发展工业、运输业和农业所需要的其他货物运到那些国家，以交换那些国家一向输出的货物，从而促进那些国家的经济发展。
    印尼报纸以许多篇幅报道了委员会的工作，特别是苏联代表的发言。印尼“人民日报”发表社论说：“苏联代表的声明对印尼人民具有极大重要性，因为那是符合印尼人民的要求的。印尼人民已体验过苏联代表所说的一切……印尼人民已感到，在他们的国家资源被外国资本集团所控制和独占的时候，要建立健全的国民经济是多么困难。”
