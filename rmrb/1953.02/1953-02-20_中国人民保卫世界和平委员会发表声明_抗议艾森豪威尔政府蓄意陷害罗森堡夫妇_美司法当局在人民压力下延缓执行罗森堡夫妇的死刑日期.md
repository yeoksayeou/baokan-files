Xinhua News Agency, February 19th -- The China Peace Committee issued a statement on the 19th protesting the Eisenhower administration's deliberate frame-up of the Rosenbergs. The full text of the statement is as follows:

    On February 11th, Eisenhower, disregarding the just protests of upright individuals in the United States and around the world, openly announced the rejection of the Rosenbergs' request to overturn their unreasonable verdict. The New York Federal Court subsequently announced that the Rosenbergs would be executed by electrocution according to the so-called "verdict" of the New York Federal Court. The Chinese people feel immense anger at this brutal crime of Eisenhower and his government, who, in contempt of human justice and dignity, are murdering good people with fabricated charges. We lodge a serious protest with the American authorities.

    Upright individuals in the United States and around the world are now continuing to demand that the U.S. Supreme Court overturn the original verdict and retry the case. We support this just demand. The U.S. government's criminal acts violating justice and humanity have aroused widespread condemnation from good people around the world. If the U.S. government persists in its criminal decision, it will only make the people of the world recognize the fascist face of the American rulers more clearly, and will more enthusiastically surge into the sacred cause of peace for which the Rosenbergs solemnly dedicated themselves.

    Xinhua News Agency, February 19th -- Popular protests have forced the U.S. judicial authorities to postpone the execution date of the Rosenbergs again. The U.S. Federal Court of Appeals in New York announced on the 17th that the execution date of the Rosenbergs would be postponed to March 30th, before which a request for retrial can be submitted to the U.S. Supreme Court.

    As previously reported, Eisenhower's announcement on the 11th that he would reject the overturning of the unreasonable verdict against the Rosenbergs immediately triggered a new wave of protest from people of all countries.

    Within the United States, the wave of protests continues to expand. Dr. Bernard Loomer, Dean of the Divinity School of the University of Chicago, wrote to Eisenhower on behalf of 2,300 Protestant ministers from various states, demanding that the Rosenberg verdict be overturned.

    抗议艾森豪威尔政府蓄意陷害罗森堡夫妇
    美司法当局在人民压力下延缓执行罗森堡夫妇的死刑日期
    【新华社十九日讯】中国人民保卫世界和平委员会十九日发表声明，抗议艾森豪威尔政府蓄意陷害罗森堡夫妇，声明全文如下：
    二月十一日艾森豪威尔不顾美国和世界各国正直人士的严正抗议，公然宣布拒绝罗森堡夫妇请求撤销对他们的无理判决的要求，纽约联邦法院并继此宣布罗森堡夫妇将按纽约联邦法院的所谓“判决”电刑处死。中国人民对艾森豪威尔及其政府这一蔑视人类正义和尊严，以捏造的罪名杀害善良人民的残暴罪行，感到莫大愤怒。我们特向美国当局提出严重抗议。
    美国和世界各国正直人士现正继续要求美国最高法院撤销原判而重新审判，我们支持这个正义的要求。美国政府的违反正义人道的罪恶行为已经引起全世界善良人民的广泛斥责。美国政府如果坚持其罪恶决定，只有使全世界人民更加认清美国统治者的法西斯面目，并且更热烈地涌入罗森堡夫妇为之庄严地献身的神圣的和平事业。
    【新华社十九日讯】人民的抗议迫使美国司法当局再次延缓对罗森堡夫妇的行刑日期。美国纽约联邦上诉法院十七日宣布把罗森堡夫妇行刑日期延到三月三十日，在这期限前可以向美国最高法院提出重审要求。
    前已报道，艾森豪威尔十一日宣布他拒绝撤销对罗森堡夫妇的无理判决的行为，立即激起了各国人民新的抗议怒潮。
   在美国国内，抗议的浪潮也在继续扩大。芝加哥大学神学院院长伯纳德·卢默博士写信给艾森豪威尔，代表美国各州二千三百名新教牧师，要求撤销对罗森堡夫妇的判决。
