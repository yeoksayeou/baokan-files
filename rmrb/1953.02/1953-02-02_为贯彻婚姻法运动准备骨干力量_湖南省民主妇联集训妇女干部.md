In order to prepare backbone forces for the Marriage Law implementation campaign, the Women Cadre School of the Preparatory Committee of the Hunan Provincial Democratic Women's Federation held its fourth cadre training class from November to December 20 last year. It trained township women representatives, as well as district and county women's federation cadres.

The training class focused on resolving the remnants of feudal ideology among the students and enhancing their understanding of the Marriage Law. When the students first arrived, most of them believed that since they were women and worked on women's issues, and often promoted the Marriage Law in rural areas, they had no remaining feudal ideas. However, after tests and informal discussions, it became clear that this was not the case. They still harbored remnants of feudal thinking. The most common was an incorrect view of women's divorce. They still held the feudal notion that "a good woman does not marry a second husband, and a good saddle does not pair with two horses" and "disapproved" of women's divorce. One district women's federation cadre used to trust a certain women's representative very much because that representative was very active in her work. However, when that women's representative confided in her about her marital pain and asked for a divorce, she changed her attitude. She thought that the women's representative was dishonest and that she shouldn't have been cultivated in the past. Therefore, not only did she not help the women's representative solve her marital problem, but she also distanced herself from her. Secondly, instead of educating and transforming men and women with improper behavior, they adopted crude methods, such as supporting militia members to "catch adulterers" and holding meetings to criticize women. Among the 277 students, 89 cadres adopted such crude methods to deal with women. Many people also opposed widows remarrying. Some even directly interfered with men and women's romances.

After these remnants of feudal thinking were exposed, the school leadership seized upon the common and serious problems, analyzed and criticized them, and improved the students' understanding. The specific method was to organize students to study and discuss the Marriage Law in group meetings and plenary sessions, analyze and criticize them in connection with practical examples, trace the root causes of their thinking, and finally point out what was wrong and why. It explained why the Marriage Law stipulated freedom of marriage and divorce, why it stipulated that widows could remarry, that women should take property with them when they divorce, and that illegitimate children should be protected, etc. After such discussion, analysis, criticism, and summary, the students' understanding of the Marriage Law was generally improved. For example, student Yang Guoshi used to take militia members to catch eight pairs of young men and women in love one night, hang signs on them during the day for "labor reform," and lock them in warehouses at night to "study the Marriage Law." When she first arrived at the training class, she thought this method was very good and effective. After discussion and criticism from her comrades, she realized that her actions were illegal.

Some students also revealed their unwillingness to do women's work. The training class then adopted the method of a typical grievance session at the plenary session to educate everyone with concrete facts. Zhang Yuming introduced her past suffering, how she begged for food, how she worked as a child bride, and how she was beaten and scolded by the landlord. When she complained, she was so sad that she sobbed, and everyone in the audience shed tears with her. After the meeting, a student from a peasant background recalled the suffering she had endured in the past and related it to the suffering of the vast number of women. She felt that her unwillingness to serve women was "forgetting her roots." Other students who were unwilling to do women's work also established a revolutionary outlook on life of fighting for the complete liberation of women "through the grievance session." They felt that if they did not think about the vast number of suffering women and do a good job in women's work in the future, they would be letting down the people.

The training class paid attention to solving ideological problems from beginning to end. Therefore, it initially eliminated the remnants of feudal thinking among the students and boosted everyone's confidence in their work. At the end of the training class, 80% of the students expressed their attitude that they must implement the Marriage Law well when they return and actively relieve the suffering caused to women by feudal marriages.

    为贯彻婚姻法运动准备骨干力量
    湖南省民主妇联集训妇女干部
    湖南省民主妇女联合会筹备委员会妇女干部学校在去年十一月到十二月二十日举办了第四期干部训练班，集训乡妇女代表会主任及区、县妇联干部，为在全省开展贯彻婚姻法运动准备骨干力量。
    训练班集中力量解决学员们的封建思想残余，提高她们对婚姻法的认识。学员入学之初，大部分都认为自己是妇女，又做妇女工作，在农村时常宣传婚姻法，没有什么封建残余思想。但经过测验、漫谈，证明并不是那样。她们仍有残余的封建思想。最普遍的是对妇女离婚的不正确看法。她们还有着所谓“好女不嫁二夫，好马不配双鞍”的封建意识，对妇女离婚“看不惯”。有一个区妇联干部，以前对一个妇女代表很信任。因为那个妇女代表工作非常积极。但是，后来那个妇女代表因向她倾诉自己的婚姻痛苦，要求离婚时，她就变了脸。她认为那个妇女代表不老实，过去不该培养她。因此，她不但不给那个妇女代表解决婚姻问题，连关系也疏远了。其次，是对作风不正派的男女不进行教育改造，而采取粗暴方式，如支持民兵“捉奸”、开会斗争妇女等。像这样采用粗暴方法对待妇女的干部，在二百七十七个学员中有八十九人。对寡妇改嫁，许多人也反对。有些还直接干涉男女恋爱。
    这些封建残余思想暴露出来以后，学校领导方面即抓住普遍的严重的问题，加以分析批判，提高学员的认识。具体作法是在小组会上、大会上组织学员学习讨论婚姻法，联系实际例子分析批判，追挖思想根源，最后指出那些是不对的，为什么不对。说明婚姻法为什么规定结婚、离婚自由，为什么规定寡妇可以改嫁、妇女在离婚时要带财产、要保护非婚生子女等。经过这样讨论、分析、批判、总结以后，学员对婚姻法的认识普遍提高了。如学员杨国士过去曾经在一天晚上带着民兵捉过八对恋爱中的青年男女，白天给他们挂上牌子“劳动改造”，晚上把他们关在仓里“学习婚姻法”。她初到训练班时，还认为这个办法很好，作用很大。经过讨论和同志们的批判，才认识到自己的作法是违法的。
    也有些学员暴露自己不愿作妇女工作的思想，训练班就采用大会典型诉苦的办法，用具体事实来教育大家。张玉明在会上介绍了自己过去受苦的情况，怎样讨饭，怎样当童养媳，怎样受地主打骂。她诉苦的时候，悲痛得泣不成声，全场的人都跟着流泪。有一个农民出身的学员在会后回想起自己过去所受的痛苦，联想到广大妇女的痛苦，觉得自己不愿为妇女服务是“忘本”。其他一些不愿做妇女工作的学员“通过诉苦会”也树立了为妇女彻底解放而斗争的革命人生观。她们觉得，今后如不为广大受痛苦的妇女群众着想，做好妇女工作，就对不起人民。
    训练班自始至终注意解决思想问题，因此初步肃清了学员中的封建残余思想，鼓舞了大家的工作信心。训练班结束时，有百分之八十的学员表明态度，回去一定要好好贯彻婚姻法，积极解除妇女因封建婚姻所造成的痛苦。
