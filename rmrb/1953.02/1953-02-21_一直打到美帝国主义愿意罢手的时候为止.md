    Fight Until U.S. Imperialism is Willing to Stop

    I. An Impenetrable Wall of Steel
    The glorious victory our army achieved in the Battle of Shangganling last October eloquently proved that our army's positions on the Korean battlefield are truly an impenetrable wall of steel, unshakeable no matter how the enemy attacks. In the past, the enemy could launch offensives on relatively long fronts and sometimes advance a little in local areas at the cost of heavy casualties; but in the Battle of Shangganling, the enemy paid the price of 25,000 casualties in a small position of three square kilometers, without advancing an inch. On January 25 this year, the U.S. aggressors launched another so-called "largest assault in more than three months" on "Triangle Hill" northwest of Tieyuan, but the result was also a complete defeat.
    Conversely, the Chinese and Korean People's forces, defending strong positions with high morale, firmly grasped the initiative and actively annihilated the enemy using a variety of combat methods such as raids, ambushes, counter-ambushes, and sniping. Even in the severe cold of minus 20 to 30 degrees Celsius in December last year and January this year, our army fought the enemy a total of 352 times, annihilating more than 26,900 enemy troops and occupying many enemy positions. In particular, our army's cold-gun and cold-cannon movement to eliminate the enemy with sniping and mobile artillery fire made the enemy on the front line afraid to raise their heads. This cold-gun and cold-cannon movement kills or wounds an average of about 300 enemies every day, throwing the enemy into a state of panic.
    This situation shows that the enemy has reached a dead end. It is neither able to break through our army's wall of steel, nor can it avoid paying heavy casualties by dragging on. The American bourgeois newspapers and "military commentators," who have always been boastful, as well as Clark, the head of the U.S. invasion of Korea, and the former commanders of the U.S. Eighth Army, Echols and Van Fleet, have had to admit that "a frontal attack on the current Chinese army's front line is out of the question" because such an attack would encounter "a terrible failure," even more serious than MacArthur's failure. They admit that "even with all the troops that can be drawn from the United States to reinforce, there is not enough strength," and even the use of atomic bombs "will not be effective."

    II. U.S. Aggressors Are Unwilling to Accept Defeat
    So, what will the United States do? Eisenhower won votes and came to power with the "promise" to "end the Korean War," which shows that the American people are unwilling to let this war of aggression against the interests of the American people continue. At the same time, as far as we are concerned, the door to ending the Korean War has always been open, as long as the United States unconditionally resumes the negotiations at Panmunjom, immediately carries out a ceasefire according to the already agreed-upon draft Korean Armistice Agreement, and then allows the "Committee for the Peaceful Settlement of the Korean Question" to resolve the issue of the complete repatriation of prisoners of war, then peace in Korea can be realized immediately. However, the Eisenhower government, in order to maintain the highest profits of the American capitalists, continues to reject peace. It tore up its "promise" and announced that it would "resolve the Korean War by military means" and claimed that it would expand the war to the entire Far East. At the same time, it unilaterally tore up the agreement on not attacking the supply vehicles of the negotiating delegation, attempting to completely destroy the Korean armistice.
    But in fact, Eisenhower the warmonger is outwardly strong but inwardly weak. When he inspected Korea before taking office, he had to admit that "there is no magic bullet that can end the Korean War." He knew that he could not win and could not continue to fight, but he still had to persevere stubbornly. Therefore, the Eisenhower government's adventurous plan to expand the war is by no means a manifestation of the strength of the U.S. aggressors, but on the contrary, it is a manifestation of its desperate struggle. This is just like the Chinese saying: "A turtle crawling on a threshold will fall no matter whether it goes forward or backward." Eisenhower's choice to expand the war will naturally make his fall even more tragic.

    III. The Incurable Disease of U.S. Military Morale
    The American president and generals are determined to continue fighting this war, knowing that they will inevitably lose. This will inevitably deepen the contradictions within the imperialist aggressive camp and between it and the American people. The American people's growing opposition to continuing the war has made the problems of insufficient U.S. troops and declining morale on the front lines increasingly serious. The latter, in particular, is what has alarmed the U.S. aggressor leaders the most.
    According to U.S. news agencies, since November of last year, desertion on the Korean battlefield has increased significantly, and has developed from individual desertions to organized collective desertions. The U.S. aggressors have used severe punishments to deal with deserters, and the military judges of each unit are busy trying deserters. They especially targeted the vassal troops, sentencing ninety-two Puerto Rican soldiers and officers who deserted to six months to ten years of imprisonment or hard labor in one instance. However, punishment cannot make American soldiers and vassal troops willingly die. Therefore, American soldiers have increasingly used more and more methods to avoid combat, some not firing their guns on the battlefield, and some simply shooting themselves. When these methods don't work, American soldiers become increasingly decadent and degenerate. According to U.S. news agencies, drug use, superstition, and crime among U.S. troops in the Korean theater have increased significantly. To drive such soldiers to fight a "victory" is just a dream.
    In order to save this dying morale, the U.S. aggressors have tried many methods: "rotation system," "hazard pay," etc. Mrs. Rosenberg, Assistant Secretary of Defense, even used the most vulgar means, promising to send some "blond-haired, blue-eyed beauties" to Korea. But these have not been effective. The U.S. Department of the Army sent a group of so-called "scientists" to the Korean battlefield to study the morale of the U.S. military. The "research" results caused the U.S. aggressors even more headaches. According to a February 1 report by International News Service reporter, Captain Littell, a psychologist who has been studying the morale of the U.S. military on the Korean front since November of last year, said that the U.S. military "front-line soldiers are governed by two completely different sets of rules." "One set is the rules issued by the military," requiring U.S. soldiers to be "ready to sacrifice at any time"; "but another set of rules, informally stipulated by his (the soldier's) squad, urges him not to sacrifice easily." The psychologist said sadly: "Soldiers understand not to take any risks."
    This "research" result vividly reveals a fundamental contradiction that can never be resolved in the U.S. aggressors' unjust war: the aggressor leaders want American soldiers to be "ready to sacrifice at any time" for the profits of Wall Street monopoly capitalists, but the soldiers who do not know why they are fighting are increasingly unwilling to die in vain—not only are they unwilling in their personal hearts, but they are also thinking of various ways to escape death in groups and squads. More and more soldiers openly, collectively, and systematically avoiding combat is the prelude to the downfall of the invading army.

    IV. All Roads Lead to a Dead End
    "A clever housewife cannot cook rice without rice." Although Eisenhower is clamoring fiercely to expand the war, his capital is so empty, his difficulties are so serious, and his contradictions are so acute, he still cannot think of a better method than his predecessor Truman.
    After being elected president, Eisenhower particularly loudly proclaimed the notorious trick of "using Asians to fight Asians." They want to rely on intensifying the expansion of the Rhee Syngman puppet army and using the remnants of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang defeated by the Chinese people to save its failure in Korea and reduce its losses. According to U.S. news agencies, the U.S. aggressors have ordered the Rhee Syngman bandit gang to put together fourteen divisions, and are preparing to have him put together another twenty divisions. In order to achieve this goal, the Rhee Syngman bandit gang has drafted 95 percent of the able-bodied men in Seoul into the army, causing every household in South Korea to be in chaos. But can such forcibly drafted men fight? Moreover, the South Korean people hate even more the dark rule of the U.S. and Rhee Syngman bandit gang and are joining the patriotic guerrilla war one after another. They are unwilling to be scapegoats for their national enemies. More and more Rhee Syngman puppet troops are defecting to our army. According to statistics from our army on the western front of Korea, the number of Rhee Syngman puppet troops who defected in one month from December 10 last year to January 10 this year is equal to two-thirds of the total number of Rhee Syngman puppet troops who defected to us in the same area from January to mid-November last year. As for wanting to rely on the Chiang bandit gang, even the U.S. congressmen and military commentators have not forgotten that he is the famous "transportation captain." Therefore, the U.S. aggressors' wishful thinking to save failure is like a drowning person grabbing at a straw.
    The U.S. warmongers still念念不忘 (constantly remember) the illusion of the MacArthur army's landing in Inchon in September 1950. Now Eisenhower is clamoring to expand the war, but he is facing our army's wall of steel, so he especially hopes to bypass the front line and launch a new so-called "amphibious landing" adventure behind our army in Korea. But have they forgotten the lesson that even though MacArthur's army landed in Inchon at that time and fought all the way to the Yalu River, it was finally defeated and retreated back to the 38th parallel? Obviously, not everyone within the U.S. ruling group is so forgetful. U.S. columnist Alsop brothers pointed out the danger of this new adventure plan in the "Washington Post" on January 16. They said that for the U.S. military to implement this plan, "it will take at least nine months to gather the necessary materials," and "the number of casualties may reach 50,000, or even more"; "the worst thing is" that this landing force may be "surrounded from both sides" by the Korean and Chinese People's forces and "fall into a tiger's mouth" and be completely annihilated.
    Of course, Eisenhower and his generals are also planning many other conspiracies and tricks, such as further plotting the Pacific aggression group, strengthening the blockade and embargo against China, and playing tricks again in the upcoming reconvened United Nations General Assembly to force its servant countries to contribute more cannon fodder to follow its adventures, and so on. But the Truman government did the same and failed. In short, the U.S. aggressors' adventurous plan to continue and expand the Korean War is bound to go bankrupt.

    V. Continue to Strengthen the Struggle to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea
    The U.S. aggressors are not reconciled to their failure. Like dying wolves, they are still struggling to take risks in their desperate situation. Therefore, we must continue to strengthen the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea. Chairman Mao instructed us at the Fourth Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference: "We want peace, but as long as U.S. imperialism does not abandon its unreasonable demands and conspiracies to expand aggression, the Chinese people's determination is to fight alongside the Korean people. This is not because we are belligerent. We are willing to cease fire immediately, and the remaining issues will be resolved in the future. But if U.S. imperialism is unwilling to do so, then so be it, let's fight on. The U.S. imperialism is willing to fight for how many years, and we are also prepared to fight with it for how many years, until the U.S. imperialism is willing to stop, until the Chinese and Korean people are completely victorious." Zhou Enlai, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, made it clear: "If the new U.S. government continues to implement the Truman government's policies, and still has no intention of resuming the Panmunjom negotiations and continues and expands the Korean War, then the Korean and Chinese people will continue to fight in this regard, and they are fully prepared. The Korean and Chinese people deeply understand that for the provocations of the imperialists, only by carrying out a resolute struggle, so that every war plan of the imperialists is crushed and every act of aggression is thoroughly defeated, can we force the enemy to stop and achieve the peace that the people long for."

    一直打到美帝国主义愿意罢手的时候为止
    一、碰不动的铜墙铁壁
    去年十月我军在上甘岭战役中取得的辉煌胜利，雄辩地证明了朝鲜战场上我军的阵地，真正是铜墙铁壁，无论敌人怎么碰也碰不动。过去敌人还能在较长的战线上发起攻势，并在付出重大伤亡代价之后，有时能在局部地区前进一点点；但在上甘岭战役中，敌人在一个三平方公里的狭小阵地上付出了二万五千人的死伤代价，却没有前进一步。今年一月二十五日，美国侵略者又在铁原西北“丁字山”发动了一次所谓“三个多月来最大的突击进攻”，结果也是一败涂地。
    相反地，守卫在强固阵地上士气高昂的中朝人民部队，却紧紧地掌握着主动权，用袭击、伏击、反袭击、狙击等多种多样的作战方式，积极消灭敌人。就在去年十二月和今年一月份零下二、三十度的那样严寒天气里，我军共对敌作战三百五十二次，歼灭了敌人二万六千九百多人，占领了敌人许多处阵地。特别是我军以狙击和游动炮火消灭敌人的冷枪冷炮运动，更打得前线上的敌人不敢抬头。这种冷枪冷炮运动，每天平均要杀伤敌人三百人左右；打得敌人丧魂失魄。
    这种形势表明：敌人已到了进退维谷的地步，既无力冲破我军的铜墙铁壁，拖下去，就不能不付出巨大的伤亡。一向大言不惭的美国资产阶级的报纸、
    “军事评论家”，直到美国侵朝战争的头目克拉克、前美军第八军军长艾奇伯格和范佛里特之流，也不得不承认：“对目前的中国军队阵线作正面进攻，是不能够加以考虑的事情”，因为这样的进攻会遭遇“惨重的失败”，甚至比麦克阿瑟的失败还要严重。他们承认：“即使用美国国内一切可以抽调的兵力去增援，还是没有足够的力量”，就连使用原子弹也“不会发生效力”。
        二、美国侵略者不甘失败
    那末，美国怎么办呢？艾森豪威尔用“结束朝鲜战争”的“诺言”骗取选票上了台，这就表明了美国人民是不愿让这个违反美国人民利益的侵朝战争继续打下去的。同时，就我们方面来说，结束朝鲜战争的大门始终是敞开着的，只要美国无条件地恢复板门店的谈判，按照已经达成协议的朝鲜停战协定草案，立即先行停战，然后再由“和平解决朝鲜问题委员会”去解决战俘全部遣返问题，那就马上可以实现朝鲜和平。可是，艾森豪威尔政府为了维持美国大资本家的最高利润，依然拒绝和平。它撕掉了自己的“诺言”，宣布要“用军事方法解决朝鲜战争”，并且声称要把战争扩大到整个远东地区。同时，它又片面撕毁了关于不袭击谈判代表团供应车辆的协议，企图把朝鲜停战彻底破坏。
    但是事实上，艾森豪威尔战争贩子是外强中干的。他在上台前巡视朝鲜的时候，就不得不承认
    “没有什么灵丹妙药可以结束朝鲜战争”。他是明知打不赢、打不下去，却还要硬撑蛮干。所以，艾森豪威尔政府扩大战争的冒险计划，绝对不是美国侵略者强大的表现，相反地却正是它绝望挣扎的表现。这正像中国俗话所说的：“乌龟爬在门坎上，进退都要摔一交。”艾森豪威尔选择了扩大战争的道路，自然会使它这一交摔得更惨重。
        三、无药可治的美军士气病
    美国总统、将军们决心继续打这个明知必败的仗，自然不可避免地要加深帝国主义侵略阵营内部和它与美国人民之间的矛盾。美国人民日益强烈地反对打下去，这使得美国兵源不足、前线士气消沉的问题，也越来越严重了。特别是后者，最使美国侵略头子们惊慌失措。
    据美国通讯社透露，从去年十一月以来，朝鲜战场上美军临阵脱逃的现象特别增多，而且由个别逃亡发展到有组织的集体逃跑。美国侵略者曾经用严刑峻法来对付逃兵，每个部队的军法官们都忙着审判逃兵。他们特别拿附庸军队来开刀，一次就把九十二个临阵逃跑的波多黎各士兵和军官判了六个月到十年的徒刑或苦役。但是，刑罚是不能叫美国士兵和附庸军自愿地去送死的。于是，美国士兵逃避战斗的方法，也就越来越多了，有的上了阵不开枪，有的干脆把自己打伤。采取了这些办法还不行的时候，美国士兵便日益颓废消沉，堕落腐化。据美国通讯社透露，朝鲜战地美军吸毒、迷信和犯罪的，都特别增多。这样的兵，要驱使他们去打“胜仗”，那只是作梦。
    美国侵略者为了挽救这样垂死的士气，曾想过许多办法：“轮换制”啦，“危险津贴”啦等等。美国国防部助理部长罗森堡夫人甚至用最下流的手段，答应送一些“金发碧眼的美女”到朝鲜去。但这些都收不到什么效果。美国陆军部又派了一批所谓“科学家”到朝鲜战场去研究美军的士气问题。“研究”出的结果是叫美国侵略者更伤脑筋的。据美国国际新闻社记者二月一日透露：从去年十一月以来就一直在朝鲜前线研究美军士气的一个心理学家立特尔上尉说：美军“前线的士兵们为两套完全不同的规则所支配着”。“一套是军方所发布的规则”，要美国士兵“随时准备牺牲”；“但是另有一套由他（指士兵）的班非正式规定的规则，则力促他不要轻易牺牲。”这个心理学家悲哀地说：“士兵们懂得了不要去冒一点点的险。”
    这个“研究”结果生动地透露出了美国侵略者进行非正义战争中永远不可解决的一个根本矛盾：侵略头子们要美国士兵为华尔街垄断资本家的利润“随时准备牺牲”，而不知为何作战的士兵们却越来越多地不愿意白白送死——不光是个人心里不愿意，而且成群成班地自己想出各种办法来逃脱死亡。越来越多的士兵们，这样公开地、集体地、有计划地逃避作战，正是侵略军队覆亡的前奏曲。
        四、条条路走不通
    “巧媳妇煮不出没有米的饭”。艾森豪威尔尽管叫嚣扩大战争叫得挺凶，但本钱是那么空虚，困难是那么严重，矛盾是那么尖锐，他想来想去还是想不出一个比他的前任杜鲁门更高明的办法。
    艾森豪威尔当选总统后，把臭名远扬的“用亚洲人打亚洲人”的诡计，特别叫得厉害。他们想靠加紧扩充李承晚伪军，利用被中国人民打败了的蒋介石残余匪帮，来挽救它在朝鲜的失败，并使自己少受损失。据美国通讯社透露，美国侵略者已经叫李承晚匪帮拼凑了十四个师，还准备要他再凑到二十个师。为了达到这个目的，李承晚匪帮把汉城的壮丁百分之九十五都抓到军队里去了，南朝鲜人民家家户户被搞得鸡飞狗走。但是，这样强抓来的壮丁能够打仗吗？何况南朝鲜人民更加痛恨美李匪帮暗无天日的统治，并纷纷参加爱国游击战争，他们是不愿替自己的民族敌人当替死鬼的。李承晚伪军向我军投诚的越来越多了。据朝鲜西线我军统计，去年十二月十日到今年一月十日这一个月中投诚的李伪军数目，等于去年一月到十一月中李伪军在同一地区向我投诚的总数的三分之二。至于想依靠蒋匪帮么，就是美国的议员、军事评论家们也没有忘记他是有名的“运输大队长”。因此，美国侵略者这个挽救失败的妄想，正像快要淹死的人抓住一根稻草一样。
    美国战争贩子们至今还念念不忘一九五○年九月麦克阿瑟军队在仁川登陆的幻景。现在艾森豪威尔叫嚣扩大战争，却又面对着我军的铜墙铁壁，于是就特别想望绕过正面的战线，在朝鲜我军后方再来发动一个所谓“两栖登陆”的新冒险。但是，难道他们已经忘记了就在那时候麦克阿瑟军队虽然在仁川登上了陆，并一直打到鸭绿江边，却终于一败涂地，退回“三八线”的教训吗？显然地，美国统治集团内部并不是所有的人都是这样善忘的。美国专栏作家阿尔索普兄弟就在一月十六日的“华盛顿邮报”上指出了这个新冒险计划的危险性。他们说，美军要实行这个计划，“集结所需物资至少要需时九个月”，而且，“死伤人数可能达到五万，甚或不只此数”；“最坏的是”这支登陆的部队可能被朝中人民部队“从两面进行包围”，“陷入老虎钳中”而被彻底歼灭。
    当然囉，艾森豪威尔及其将军们还盘算着其他许多的阴谋诡计，譬如进一步策划太平洋侵略集团，加强对中国的封锁禁运，并在即将复会的联合国大会中再耍花样，强迫它的仆从国家出更多的炮灰，跟着它冒险等等。但这一切，杜鲁门政府就是这样做过的，并且是失败了的。总之一句话，美国侵略者继续和扩大朝鲜战争的冒险计划，是一定要破产的。
        五、继续加强抗美援朝斗争
    美国侵略者对于他们的失败是死不甘心的。他们像垂死的狼一样，在山穷水尽中还是挣扎着要冒险的。所以，我们还要继续加强抗美援朝的斗争。毛主席在中国人民政协第一届全国委员会第四次会议上指示我们：“我们是要和平的，但是，只要美帝国主义一天不放弃它那种横蛮无理的要求和扩大侵略的阴谋，中国人民的决心就是只有同朝鲜人民一起，一直战斗下去。这不是因为我们好战，我们愿意立即停战，剩下的问题待将来去解决。但美帝国主义不愿意这样做，那么好罢，就打下去，美帝国主义愿意打多少年，我们也就准备跟他打多少年，一直打到美帝国主义愿意罢手的时候为止，一直打到中朝人民完全胜利的时候为止。”人民政协全国委员会周恩来副主席说得明白：“如果美国新政府仍然执行杜鲁门政府的政策，仍然无意于恢复板门店谈判而继续和扩大朝鲜战争，那么，朝中人民在这方面也将继续斗争下去，并且是有了充分准备的。朝中人民深刻地了解，对于帝国主义者的挑衅，只有进行坚决的斗争，使帝国主义者的每一个战争计划都受到粉碎性的打击，每一个侵略行动都遭到彻底的失败，才能迫使敌人罢手，取得人民所热望的和平。”
