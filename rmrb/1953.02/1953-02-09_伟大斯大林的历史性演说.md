    The Historical Speech of the Great Stalin
    Soviet Union En. Luojinuofu

    Seven years ago, on February 9, 1946, Stalin delivered a speech at the Voters' Assembly of the Stalin Electoral District in Moscow.

    In his speech, Stalin gave a brilliant Marxist analysis of the causes and nature of the Second World War. Stalin brilliantly summarized the Soviet Patriotic War, revealed that the Communist Party was the inspirer and organizer of all the victories of the Soviet people, indicated the source of the strength and invincibility of the Soviet social system and state system, and displayed the grand program of Soviet communist construction.

    This program was drafted a few months after the end of the war. At that time, the wounds of the war were still fresh, and many cities and villages destroyed by the fascist bandits were still in ruins. At that time, the American and British newspapers were filled with articles saying that the long-term decline of the Soviet economy was inevitable, and that the Soviet Union could not get rid of the post-war difficulties by its own efforts. The enemies of the Soviet people had made selfish plans to enslave the Soviet Union.

    At this time, Stalin's wisdom, like a powerful searchlight, illuminated the grand prospect of post-war development for the Soviet people - the prospect of communist construction. The leader's inspiring words aroused the people to establish new labor feats for the further consolidation of the Soviet Union's power and for the struggle for world peace.

    In the Great Patriotic War, the Soviet Union, under the leadership of the Party of Lenin and Stalin, won a victory of worldwide historical significance. This victory shows that it was the victory of the Soviet social system, a truly people's system that grew from within the people and was strongly supported by the people.

    This victory shows that it was the victory of the Soviet state system. The multi-ethnic Soviet state withstood all the tests of the war and proved to be the most vital. It grew on the basis of cultivating brotherly friendship and cooperation among all ethnic groups in the country.

    This victory shows that it was the victory of the Soviet armed forces, the glorious Soviet army - the top army of modern times. It heroically overcame all the hardships of wartime and became the victor. The Soviet army not only defended the freedom and independence of the Soviet Union, but also saved the world civilization from the fascist plague. The Soviet army was the very army that smashed the fascist German army head-on, which not long ago made the armies of European countries tremble with fear.

    It is quite obvious that if there had not been the great achievements of the Soviet people in the political and economic upsurge of the Soviet state before this, then this victory would not have been achieved.

    The highly developed socialist industry and advanced agriculture supplied the war with huge resources. The Soviet state achieved such results that it could not only supply the front with a sufficient amount of weapons, but also accumulate the necessary reserves. At the same time, the quality of Soviet weapons greatly exceeded that of the German invaders. The Soviet army not only had no shortage of food and clothing, but even had the necessary reserves.

    The Communist Party overcame all obstacles in the struggle for national industrialization and agricultural collectivization, and ruthlessly exposed all anti-Party conspiracies of the Trotskyites and rightists who attempted to sabotage the Party's policies and hinder industrialization and collectivization. "The Party," Comrade Stalin pointed out, "was neither moved by the threats of some people nor by the sobbing of others, but moved forward confidently and relentlessly. The merit of the Party lies in the fact that it did not cater to the backward elements, was not afraid of going against the tide, and always maintained its position as a leading force."

    Due to the Soviet Union's victory of worldwide historical significance, the people of a series of European and Asian countries liberated from imperialist oppression have mastered their own destiny and steadily embarked on the road of building a new free life. People's democratic systems have won and been established in Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Albania. The Chinese people have won a great victory in establishing the People's Republic of China. Due to the annihilation of the fascist army and the purging of the Hitler regime, the German Democratic Republic, which joined the camp of peace and democracy, was established.

    In his speech seven years ago, Stalin indicated the basic task of the first post-war Five-Year Plan - to restore the pre-war level of industry and agriculture, and even exceed this level to a considerable extent. Stalin indicated when mentioning the plan for a longer period that the Party decided to create a strong new upsurge in the national economy, so that the level of Soviet industry could be increased to three times the pre-war level in the next fifteen years. We must enable our industry to produce 50 million tons of pig iron, 60 million tons of steel, 500 million tons of coal, and 60 million tons of oil every year.

    The Soviet people accepted this plan, this fighting program that conforms to their vital interests.

    In the Soviet Union, a nationwide socialist competition was launched to complete the Fourth Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. The creative initiative of the Soviet people was manifested with new strength, and thus the post-war Five-Year Plan was completed ahead of schedule.

    The post-war years, for the Soviet Union, were years of great achievements in all aspects of industry, transportation, agriculture, science, culture and art. At the same time, this was also a year of further consolidation of the Soviet system, the unity of the Soviet social morality and politics and the enhancement of the friendship of all ethnic groups in the Soviet Union, and a year of further consolidation of the camp of peace and democracy.

    The war delayed the industrial development of the Soviet Union by eight or nine years.

    Due to the successful recovery and development of industry in the post-war years, the current level of industrial production has greatly exceeded the pre-war level. In 1951, the total industrial output had exceeded the pre-war level of 1940 by more than one time, while in 1952 it exceeded the 1940 level by about 1.3 times.

    The industry that manufactures the means of production has developed particularly rapidly. In his summary report on the work of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union to the Nineteenth National Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Malenkov said that the output in 1952 would be as follows: 25 million tons of milled iron, an increase of about 70 percent over 1940; 35 million tons of steel, an increase of about 90 percent over 1940; 27 million tons of rolled metal, more than double the increase over 1940; 300 million tons of coal, an increase of more than 80 percent over 1940; 47 million tons of oil, an increase of more than 50 percent over 1940; 117 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity, an increase of 1.4 times over 1940; the output of machines and equipment will exceed more than twice that of 1940.

    Socialist agriculture has achieved great achievements. In 1952, the total harvest of grain reached 8 billion poods, and the total harvest of the most important food crop - wheat - increased by 48 percent over 1940. Agriculture is constantly equipped with the most advanced technology. Specifically, the total horsepower of tractors owned by agricultural machinery stations and state farms has increased by 59 percent over the pre-war level, and the total horsepower of combine harvesters has increased by 51 percent. The total output and commodity output of meat, milk, oil, eggs, wool and leather in the entire Soviet Union have exceeded the pre-war level.

    In the Soviet Union, a grand plan to transform nature is being implemented, powerful hydropower stations are being built on the Volga and Dnieper rivers, large canals are being dug to facilitate navigation and irrigation, and protective forest belts are being established in vast areas of the country. In 1952, one of the great construction projects of communism - the Lenin Volga-Don Canal - began to open to navigation.

    Comrade Stalin's brilliant masterpiece "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR" and the historic resolutions of the Nineteenth National Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union armed the Soviet people with a grand program for communist construction. In the guidelines of the Fifth Five-Year Plan, a huge new upsurge in all departments of the national economy and culture is planned. Specifically, the level of industrial production in 1955 will increase by about 70 percent compared with 1950, and the output of industrial products in 1955 will increase by two times compared with 1940. The Fifth Five-Year Plan means that the Soviet Union has taken another big step forward on the road of development from socialism to communism.

    The grand plan predetermined by Stalin, the great architect of communism, in his historical speech seven years ago, is being realized in this way.

    The people of the world clearly see the two lines of economic development. One line is the line of continuous improvement of the peaceful economy of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. This economy does not know what a crisis is and is developing to ensure the maximum satisfaction of the material and cultural needs of the entire society. The friendly economic cooperation of the countries in the democratic camp is the characteristic of this economy.

    The other line is the line of the capitalist economy, whose productive forces are stagnant and economic crises are frequently repeated in the panic of the deepening general crisis of the capitalist system. This is the line of militarizing the economy and unilaterally developing the production sectors engaged in war, the line of bankrupting and impoverishing the majority of residents in the capitalist world, the line of competition and conflict between countries and the enslavement of some countries by others.

    The Soviet people are confidently looking to the future. It is advancing together with the entire socialist democratic camp, with the great Chinese people, the working people of the European people's democratic countries and the German Democratic Republic.

    "Now," Comrade Stalin said in his speech at the Nineteenth National Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, "from China and Korea to Czechoslovakia and Hungary, a new 'shock force' in the form of people's democratic countries has emerged - now it is easier for our party to fight, and this work is done more vigorously."

    The Soviet people unswervingly defend the cause of peace. The peace-loving people of the world received with excitement and expectation Stalin's answer to the questions raised by the diplomatic correspondent of the "New York Times," in which Stalin once again emphasized the possibility of peaceful coexistence of the two systems and the determination of the Soviet government to promote the easing of international tensions and consolidate the cause of peace.

    The strengthening of the Soviet Union's strength and the consolidation of the strength of the peace and democracy camp are the best guarantee of world peace.

    伟大斯大林的历史性演说
    苏联  恩·罗基诺夫
    七年前，一九四六年二月九日，斯大林在莫斯科城斯大林选区选民大会上作了演说。
    斯大林在演说中，对于第二次世界大战的原因及性质，作了天才的马克思主义的分析。斯大林精湛地作出了苏联卫国战争的总结，昭示了共产党是苏联人民一切胜利的鼓舞者和组织者，指示了苏维埃社会制度和国家制度的力量和不可战胜性的泉源，并展示了苏联共产主义建设的宏伟纲领。
    这个纲领是在战争结束数月后拟定的。这时，战争的创伤犹新，许多被法西斯匪徒破坏的城市和乡村依然是一片废墟。这时，美英两国的报刊充满了这样的文章，说什么苏联经济的长期衰落是不可避免的，说什么苏联不可能用自力摆脱战后的困难。苏联人民的敌人们曾给自己打好了奴役苏联的自私自利的如意算盘。
    在这时候，斯大林的英明，像强力的探照灯一样，给苏联人民照亮了战后发展的宏伟远景——共产主义建设的远景。领袖的鼓舞人心的话语唤起了人民为苏联威力的进一步巩固和为争取全世界和平来建立新的劳动功勋。
    在伟大卫国战争中，苏联在列宁、斯大林党的领导下获得了具有全世界历史意义的胜利。这个胜利说明：获得了胜利的是苏维埃社会制度，是由人民内部成长的并得到人民大力支持的真正人民的制度的胜利。
    这个胜利说明：获得了胜利的是苏维埃国家制度。多民族的苏维埃国家经住了战争的一切考验，并证明出它是最富有生命力的。它是在培植国内各族人民间的兄弟友谊和合作的基础上生长起来的。
    这个胜利说明：获得了胜利的是苏联的武装力量，是光荣的苏联军队——现代的头等军队。它英勇地克服了战时一切艰难困苦而成为胜利者。苏联军队不仅捍卫住苏联的自由和独立，而且把全世界文明从法西斯瘟疫中拯救出来。苏联军队正是把不久前还使欧洲各国军队胆战心寒的法西斯德军当头击破了的那个军队。
    十分显然，假如在这以前没有苏联人民在苏维埃国家政治和经济高涨事业中的巨大成就，那末这种胜利是不会获得的。
    高度发展的社会主义工业和先进的农业供给了战争以巨大的资源，苏维埃国家达到了这样的成绩，就是它不仅能为前线供给了数量充足的武器，而且积蓄起必要的后备品。同时，苏联的武器质量大大超过了德寇的。苏联军队的粮食和服装不仅没有任何缺乏，甚至还拥有必要的后备品。
    共产党在国家工业化和农业集体化的斗争中克服了一切横在途中的障碍，无情地揭露了企图破坏党的政策并阻碍工业化和集体化的托洛茨基分子和右倾分子的一切反党勾当。 “党，——斯大林同志指出说，——既没有为某些人的威胁所动，也没有为另一些人的啜泣所动，而是有把握地，不顾一切地向前迈进。党的功绩就在于它没有去附和落后分子，不害怕违反潮流，并始终给自己保持着领导力量底地位。”
    由于苏联的具有全世界历史意义的胜利，从帝国主义压迫下解放出来的欧洲和亚洲一系列国家的人民已掌握了自己的命运，稳步踏上了建设新的自由生活的道路。在波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、罗马尼亚、匈牙利、保加利亚、阿尔巴尼亚各国内，人民民主制度已获得胜利并确立起来。建立了中华人民共和国的中国人民获得了伟大胜利。由于歼灭了法西斯军队和肃清了希特勒制度，建立了加入和平与民主阵营的德意志民主共和国。
    斯大林在七年前的演说中指示了战后第一个五年计划的基本任务——恢复工农业的战前水平，以至于在颇大程度上超过这个水平。斯大林在提到更长一个时期的计划时指示说，党决定造成国民经济强大的新高涨，使苏联工业水平能够在最近十五年内提高到战前水平的三倍，必须使我们工业能每年出产生铁五千万吨，钢六千万吨，煤炭五万万吨，石油六千万吨。
    苏联人民接受了这个计划，这个符合于他们切身利益的战斗纲领。
    在苏联，展开了为提前完成第四个五年计划的全民性的社会主义竞赛。苏联人的创造性主动精神以新的力量表现了出来，因而提前完成了战后五年计划。
    战后的年代，对苏联来说，是在工业、运输、农业和科学、文化艺术一切方面获得重大成就的年代。同时，这也是苏维埃制度进一步巩固、苏维埃社会道德政治的统一与苏联各族人民友谊增强的年代，是和平和民主阵营进一步巩固的年代。
    战争使苏联的工业发展耽搁了八、九年。
    由于工业在战后几年中的顺利恢复和发展，现在的工业生产水平大大超过了战前水平。在一九五一年工业总产量已超过一九四零年战前水平一倍以上，而在一九五二年则比一九四零年约超过一点三倍。
    制造生产资料的工业发展得特别迅速。马林科夫在苏联共产党第十九次代表大会上所作的关于苏联共产党中央委员会工作的总结报告中说，一九五二年的产量将如下：铣铁二千五百万吨，约比一九四零年增加百分之七十；钢三千五百万吨，约比一九四零年增加百分之九十；压延金属二千七百万吨，比一九四零年增加一倍多；煤三亿吨，比一九四零年增加百分之八十多；石油四千七百万吨，比一九四零年增加百分之五十多；电力一千一百七十亿瓩时，比一九四零年增加一点四倍；机器和设备将超过一九四零年产量的两倍多。
    社会主义农业获得了重大成就。一九五二年，谷物的总收获量达八十亿普特，而最重要的粮食作物——小麦——的总收获量比一九四零年增加了百分之四十八。农业不断地用最完善的技术来装备着。具体地说来，农业机器站和国营农场所拥有的拖拉机的总马力比战前水平增加了百分之五十九，联合收割机的总马力增加了百分之五十一。整个苏联的肉类、乳类、油类、蛋类、羊毛和皮革的总产量和商品产量，都已超过了战前水平。
    在苏联，正实行着改造自然的宏伟计划，在伏尔加河和第聂伯河上建设着强大的水电站，开凿着便利航运和灌溉的大运河并在国内广大地区内建立防护林带。在一九五二年，共产主义伟大建设工程之一——列宁伏尔加河—顿河运河已开始通航了。
    斯大林同志的“苏联社会主义经济问题”这部天才名著和苏联共产党第十九次代表大会的历史性决定，以共产主义建设的宏伟纲领武装了苏联人民。在第五个五年计划的指示中，预定国民经济和文化
    一切部门的巨大新高涨。具体地说来，一九五五年工业生产水平将比一九五零年约增加百分之七十，
    一九五五年的工业产品的产量将比一九四零年增加两倍。第五个五年计划意味着：苏联在从社会主义走向共产主义的发展道路上，又迈进了一大步。
    共产主义的伟大建筑师斯大林在七年前的历史性演说中所预定的宏伟计划，就是这样地实现着。
    全世界人民清楚地看到经济发展的两条路线。一条路线是苏联和各人民民主国家和平经济不断提高的路线，这个经济不知危机为何物，并且为保证最大限度地满足整个社会的物质和文化需要而发展。民主阵营各国家的友好经济合作就是这个经济的特征。
    另一条路线是资本主义经济的路线，它的生产力停滞不前，在资本主义体系总危机日益加深的恐慌中，经常重演经济危机。这是使经济军事化和从事战争的生产部门片面发展的路线，是使资本主义世界大多数居民破产和贫困化的路线，是使各国互相竞争和冲突以及一些国家奴役另一些国家的路线。
    苏联人民正信心百倍地注视着未来。它正和整个社会主义民主阵营一道，正和伟大的中国人民、欧洲各人民民主国家及德意志民主共和国的劳动人民
    一道向前迈进。
    “现在，——斯大林同志在苏联共产党第十九次代表大会上的演说中说，——从中国和朝鲜直到捷克斯洛伐克和匈牙利，已经出现了人民民主国家形式的新‘突击队’——现在我们的党进行斗争是比较容易了，这种工作也做得更是蓬蓬勃勃了。”
    苏联人民始终不渝地保卫着和平事业。全世界的爱好和平的人民满怀兴奋和期望地领会了斯大林对“纽约时报”外交记者所提出的问题的答复，斯大林在这个答复中再次着重指出了两个制度和平共处的可能性和苏联政府促进缓和国际紧张形势及巩固和平事业的决心。
    苏联实力的增强与和平民主阵营力量的巩固是全世界和平的最好保证。
