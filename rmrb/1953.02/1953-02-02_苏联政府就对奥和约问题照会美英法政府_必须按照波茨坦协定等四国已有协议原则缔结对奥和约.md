Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 28th: The Soviet government sent notes to the governments of the United States, Britain, and France on January 27 regarding the issue of concluding an Austrian treaty, responding to the notes sent to the Soviet Union by the three governments on January 12. The notes from the United States, Britain, and France, based on the so-called United Nations General Assembly resolution of December 20, 1952, on the Austrian question, suggested convening a meeting of deputy foreign ministers in the near future to discuss the Austrian treaty issue.

The Soviet note first pointed out that raising the Austrian question in the United Nations and making a resolution on this issue are both illegal. According to Article 107 of the United Nations Charter, handling the Austrian question is not within the jurisdiction of the United Nations, but entirely within the jurisdiction of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France. The four countries bear obligations to Austria due to past agreements they have signed.

The note then pointed out that the Soviet government had repeatedly suggested to the governments of the United States, Britain, and France that the work of drafting the Austrian treaty be accelerated based on the principles of the agreements already reached by the four governments. This draft treaty is based on the 1943 Moscow Declaration, the Potsdam Agreement, and the decisions made by the four foreign ministers' meeting in June 1949 on important political and economic issues concerning Austria. However, the US government and the British and French governments avoided accepting the above-mentioned suggestions from the Soviet government and attempted to replace the Austrian treaty with a so-called "Brief Treaty," thereby continuing to obstruct the conclusion of the Austrian treaty.

The note solemnly pointed out that the so-called "Brief Treaty" does not conform to the decisions of the Potsdam Conference and other agreements reached by the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France on the Austrian question. The "Brief Treaty" does not stipulate how to restore Austria to a truly independent and democratic country, nor does it guarantee the democratic rights and freedoms of the Austrian people. On the contrary, it gives Austria ample opportunity to restore the fascist regime and utilize Austria to implement the aggressive plans of the North Atlantic Group.

The note pointed out that in order to quickly conclude the Austrian treaty, the Soviet government clearly stated in the three notes sent to the governments of the United States, Britain, and France on January 18, August 14, and September 27, 1952, that the Soviet government was willing to participate in the four-power representatives' meeting on the Austrian question. At the same time, the Soviet government believes that it is necessary to first clarify whether the US government and the British and French governments are willing to withdraw their proposed suggestions for an Austrian "Brief Treaty" and complete the review of the Austrian treaty. Regarding this issue, the Soviet government has not yet received a reply from the US government or the British and French governments, and the US, British, and French governments still avoid answering the above-mentioned question raised by the Soviet government in their notes of January 12.

The Soviet note finally reiterated the position clearly expressed by the Soviet government in the above-mentioned three notes, which is that the Soviet government is willing to participate in the four-power representatives' meeting on the Austrian question, but it must know in advance that the three governments agree to withdraw the "Brief Treaty."

    苏联政府就对奥和约问题照会美英法政府
    必须按照波茨坦协定等四国已有协议原则缔结对奥和约
    【新华社三十一日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科二十八日讯：苏联政府于一月二十七日就缔结对奥和约问题照会美、英、法三国政府，答复三国政府在一月十二日致苏联的照会。美、英、法三国的照会根据所谓一九五二年十二月二十日联合国大会关于奥地利问题的决议，建议在最近期间召开讨论对奥和约问题的外长助理会议。
    苏联的照会首先指出：在联合国中提出奥地利问题和就这个问题作出决议都是非法的，因为处理奥地利问题，按照联合国宪章第一百零七条的规定，并不在联合国权限之内，而是完全在苏、美、英、法四国权限之内的事情，四国由于过去所签订的协定而负担了对奥地利的义务。
    照会接着指出：苏联政府曾一再向美、英、法三国政府建议，根据四国政府所已经取得的协议的原则，加速完成草拟对奥和约的工作。这一和约草案以一九四三年莫斯科宣言、波茨坦协定以及一九四九年六月四国外长会议关于奥地利重要政治与经济问题所作的决定为根据。然而，美国政府和英法两国政府避不接受上述苏联政府的建议，而企图以所谓“简要条约”代替对奥和约，从而继续阻挠缔结对奥和约。
    照会严正地指出：所谓“简要条约”是不符合波茨坦会议的决定以及苏、美、英、法四国就奥地利问题达成的其他协议的。“简要条约”没有规定如何使奥地利恢复为一个真正独立、民主的国家，没有保证奥地利人民的民主权利和自由，反而给予奥地利以恢复法西斯政权的充分机会，并利用奥地利来实行北大西洋集团的侵略计划。
    照会指出：为了迅速缔结对奥和约，苏联政府在一九五二年一月十八日、八月十四日和九月二十七日致美、英、法三国政府的三个照会中曾明白表示：苏联政府愿意参加四国代表关于奥地利问题的会议，同时，苏联政府认为，必须首先弄清楚，美国政府及英、法两国政府是否愿意撤回它们提出的对奥“简要条约”的建议并完成审议对奥和约的工作。关于这个问题，苏联政府直到现在还没有接到美国政府或英、法两国政府的答复，美、英、法三国政府在一月十二日的照会中仍然避而不答苏联政府所提出的上项问题。
    苏联的照会最后重申苏联政府在上述三次照会中所明白表示过的立场，就是：苏联政府愿意参加四国代表关于奥地利问题的会议，但必须事先知道三国政府同意撤回“简要条约”。
