Introducing "The Basic Principles of Darwinism"
Compiled by the Genetic Breeding Experiment Museum of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Beijing Agricultural University. Published by The Commercial Press. Zhou Jianren

The preface and a foreword of the book explain that this book is compiled based on the lectures prepared by Soviet experts for the "Darwinism Research Class."

The upper volume of this book is divided into two parts besides the introduction. The first part is "The Struggle for Evolutionary Ideas Before Darwin," which is a brief history of evolutionary theory before Darwin. It starts from the Greek era and ends with the 19th-century Russian evolutionists. Among them, the theories of Buffon, Lamarck, and Saint-Hilaire are introduced in more detail.

The second part is "Darwin's Basic Theory." It starts with the British social background of the era when Darwin engaged in research, and then introduces and explains the variability, heredity, artificial selection, natural selection, and the struggle for existence mentioned in Darwin's "On the Origin of Species." It concludes with the evaluation of Darwinism by the founders of Marxism-Leninism. The arrangement is very clear.

The lower volume of this book is also divided into two parts, namely the third and fourth parts. The third part is "The Basic Method of Studying the Biological World Under the Light of Darwinian Theory." It starts with proving evolution from paleontology, and then talks about the proof of evolution in anatomy, embryology, etc. The work of Pavlov and others is also mentioned. These narratives provide more detailed evidence for the theory of evolution.

The fourth part is "Michurin's Theory is the Highest Stage of Development of Biological Science." It mainly narrates the basic principles of Michurin's theory and the achievements of Academician Lysenko. It provides a dialectical materialist explanation of the unity of organisms and living conditions, the true meaning of metabolism, and the essence of heredity and variability.

Darwinism originated in capitalist countries (England). However, in capitalist countries, it has been distorted and subjected to various malicious attacks. Especially in the United States, many states prohibit the teaching of Darwinism in schools. Several years ago, a young teacher named Scopes in Dayton was accused, convicted, and punished for teaching the scientific fact that humans evolved from apes. Its absurdity went to such an extent!

In the Soviet Union, however, Darwinian theory is very popular and valued. Lenin praised Darwin as "establishing biology on a completely scientific basis for the first time," and Stalin also said that his and Lamarck's "evolutionary method made biological science stand up" (original book, page 331). This book also highly praises Darwin, saying that he paved the way for Marx's statement that "philosophers have only interpreted the world in various ways, but our task is to change the world!" (original book, page 4)!

It should be pointed out that this book does not simply repeat Darwinian theory. Not at all. It promotes the correct parts of Darwinism and criticizes and corrects the erroneous parts. Regarding Darwin's mistakes, the most well-known is that he introduced Malthus's population theory into his theory. This book refutes the fallacy that the population increases geometrically and food only increases arithmetically, thus leading to overpopulation. It also points out that Darwin's view that intraspecies struggle is the most intense is not in line with the facts. This book cited Lysenko's novel theory. The facts also show very clearly that the escape instinct of pikas is used to escape the pursuit of animals such as cats and foxes, and is not used for struggles between individuals of the same species; the sharp claws and teeth of tigers and leopards are used to capture other animals and are not used to deal with individuals of the same species.

Although Darwin himself declared that the term struggle for existence contained a metaphorical meaning (showing that he himself felt that this term was not very appropriate), when it came to the "excessive" reproduction of organisms, he used words like "only to be suppressed by destruction suffered in a certain period of life" (original book, page 144) to "explain" it. Therefore, his description easily leads others to see the biological world as a place of cruel competition. This book clearly points out that this description is wrong, and at the same time corrects the erroneous views arising from it. The book says: "Thus, Darwin described the scene of this destruction, a description that far surpassed the bravest fantasies of artists or poets. The nature he described is not clear and good, not the peaceful scene of nature that we usually see, but makes us surprisingly discover a terrible chaos, where all organisms are mixed and entangled in a cruel and deadly battle, and every organism must step over the corpses of millions of its kind to enter life." (original book, page 144)

This book criticizes this shortcoming in Darwinian theory by saying: "Darwin, when he was confused by Malthus's 'theory,' completely ignored that in many examples of the natural selection quoted in 'On the Origin of Species,' over-reproduction and the competition caused by over-reproduction do not play any role." (original book, page 146). "Darwin himself felt that he could never understand the problem of the life of species. He wrote: 'The reasons that prevent the natural tendency of each species to increase in number are very obscure.'" (original book, page 148).

These shortcomings in Darwinian theory have certain social roots. This book correctly analyzes Darwin's class background and the historical environment in which he lived, explaining that the contradictions and shortcomings in Darwinian theory "are related to the harmful influence of bourgeois ideology on great natural scientists" (original book, page 239). In capitalist society, cruel competition and the system of human exploitation dominate. Therefore, the prevailing ideas in this capitalist society are easily reflected in Darwin's biological works.

The above-mentioned shortcomings, errors, and social roots in Darwinian theory are only the most well-known. In addition, there are some more specialized issues that are less frequently mentioned, and I will also talk about them here.

The question Darwin personally fought against his enemies was whether species change or remain unchanged. He strongly affirmed the universality of variation in organisms first. But he only believed that the variability and heredity of organisms are natural facts in nature, and he thought it was not easy to understand their origin and essence, so he did not go further to investigate.

Darwin's feeling that the nature of variation is not easy to understand is clearly related to the lack of clear understanding of the relationship between organisms and the surrounding living conditions. Although Darwin believed that external conditions could cause changes in organisms, he sometimes believed that external conditions only had the effect of a spark when the primer burns on organisms. In addition, Darwin clearly saw that the variation of organisms had both slow gradual changes and sudden leaps, but he believed that the creation of new species was mainly due to gradual changes plus the struggle for existence and selection. In his book "On the Origin of Species," he fought against special creation on the one hand, and on the other hand, he repeatedly quoted Leibniz's erroneous statement that "there are no leaps in nature," thus filling the book with the meaning of this statement. Darwin regarded the variation of the biological world as a general continuous small individual variation. His battle against the special creation theory was victorious, but it was also flawed. Because of this, idealistic opposition took the opportunity to invade. The Soviet Michurin and Lysenko actively developed Darwin's thoughts. While developing his thoughts, they also corrected his flawed side. This book narrates the theories of Michurin and Lysenko, explaining that the heritable variation of organisms is produced under changed living conditions, which is not different from Darwin's opinions; but they have taken a step further, explaining that heredity, as a characteristic of organisms, is not only closely related to metabolism, but also that the heredity of organisms is only the type of metabolism of that organism. Different organisms have different modes of metabolism, and therefore have different natures, that is, heredity. The organism and the environment are a complete unity. But past biology did not recognize this. If this is recognized, if it is recognized that the organism becomes its own (that is, internal things) by assimilating external things to form its body, then it can be recognized that if external conditions change, organisms will naturally change. At the same time, the principle that the type of metabolism changes and the nature of the organism also changes becomes very clear. Heredity not only inherits the similarity between generations of organisms, but also inherits the difference between generations.

I said earlier that Darwin's struggle with special creation was mainly about whether species change or not, and had not yet gone deeply into the question of how species can vary. The task of solving this problem fell on the shoulders of the Soviet Michurin and Lysenko, and they have basically achieved victory.

In Darwin's era, the idealism that supported special creation was defeated, but there were still idealists who inherited the anti-progressive side and retreated to the second line of defense. This is the Weismann-Morgan school. They said that "genetic material" is basically unaffected by the outside world, is independent of the body, and is immutable. They believe that: "Even if the individual changes under the action of external environmental conditions, this change cannot affect the history of the species" (original book, page 483). Obviously, this is opposed to Darwin's theory. Michurin biology does not recognize the existence of special genetic material in organisms, just as there is no other sweet substance in sugar. "According to Michurin's theory, ... the change in the hereditary characteristics of an organism is always only due to the change in the development of the organism under the influence of the external environmental conditions that it assimilates."
(original book, page 484) Michurin used all his scientific power to further defeat the idealism that advocated the immutability of genetic material, and made further development of Darwinism.

Another thing that is of great importance to the development of Darwinism is the clear understanding of the nature of species. Darwin believed that the main variations of organisms are only slow, gradual, and without jumps. The evolution resulting from this variation is also only quantitative and not qualitative. This theory of gradual change also influenced Darwin's incorrect understanding of species. Darwin believed that only individuals with variations exist in nature, and the name "species" was imagined for various conveniences. He believed that the name of a species is nothing more than representing a group of individuals that are very similar to each other, and there is no essential difference from the name of a variety. The so-called variety only refers to types with less significant differences and less stable traits. In other words, "he did not regard the species as a unified whole, but as the total number of individual individuals. These individuals seem to only realize all life processes in order to preserve their individual lives, so struggles and competition inevitably occur between them." (original book, page 538).

Soviet advanced biology, however, views species and varieties in this way. First of all, it believes that species are formed by qualitative changes. Species are the links in the chain of the biological world, a qualitatively special stage, and a stage in the historical development of the biological world. Varieties are also not transitional intermediate types or steps from this species to other species, they are actually the form of existence of species. Species containing many varieties can obtain various adaptations and prosperity. As mentioned earlier, the new correct theory does not recognize intraspecies struggle. Further understanding that the relationship between individuals within a species and individuals outside a species is qualitatively different. Just like individuals of the same species can pollinate each other. The same is true between varieties.

Since Darwinism has the above-mentioned shortcomings and errors, why should we introduce it? Because Darwin indeed has immortal achievements in history.

Darwin's scientific achievement lies in his scientific explanation of the rationality of organisms adapting to the conditions of their living environment. Lenin said: Darwin's work finally drove God out of nature, and biological science stood up. Darwin explained that the modern organic world is the result of long-term historical development, in which there is no power of God to intervene. Darwin's book "On the Origin of Species" is a historical landmark in the development of biological science, and it led biological science to a new era. Engels wrote in evaluating the great development of biological science in the 19th century: "It should be pointed out that Darwin powerfully struck at the metaphysical view of nature, because he proved that all modern biological world - plants and animals, and therefore man, too - is the product of a continuous process of development for millions of years." (original book, page 231) Darwin's explanation of the surrounding organic world is basically correct. He spontaneously applied the idea of development completely, and he correctly explained the historical development process of the organic world. This book praises him for proving that species are produced by other species, "and also proved that the biological world has its own history, its own past, present, and future. This is one of the immortal contributions of Darwin's theory." (original book, page 574) Stalin also classified Darwin as one of the people "who can destroy the old and create the new regardless of any obstacles and regardless of everything" (original book, page 231).

"Biological science has always been a battlefield for sharp ideological struggles throughout its entire history. Now, in the era of the struggle between two worlds, the conflict between the materialist and idealist worldviews in the biological science community is particularly obvious. Recently, two diametrically opposed directions have formed: one direction is the materialist advanced Michurin direction, whose name is named after the great Soviet scholar and its founder, Michurin. The other direction is the reactionary, idealistic Weismann direction, whose founders are the bourgeois biologists Weismann, Mendel, and Morgan."
(original book, page 482) This says that in the two camps fighting for Darwinism, there is only one truth, and it is only on one side. The materialist progressive Darwinism - that is, the creative Darwinism that has been promoted and corrected - is real science, and the idealistic anti-progressive Weismannism is empty false science. Natural scientists must firmly learn true science and not learn empty false science.

I said earlier that this book praises Darwin, saying that he paved the way for Marx's statement that "philosophers have only used various methods to explain the world, but our task is to change the world." Michurin, Lysenko, and their supporters have taken a step further and have truly carried out the work of transforming nature.

The above is a simple introduction to the contents of the book. I will also say a few words about the translation. Some time ago, an agricultural professor wrote to me and told me that he had checked four English-Chinese dictionaries and all translated rye as naked barley; therefore, some books translated from Russian also translated rye as naked barley. This is probably because they checked the Russian-English dictionary and then translated according to the English-Chinese dictionary. This book, however, is translated correctly.

But there are some translations that are still debatable. For example, Oleaeuropaea is usually translated as olive or European olive. But this book translates it as olive tree, which is easy to confuse with the olive tree that grows edible green fruit. On page 146, when talking about Darwin's calculation of the reproductive rate of elephants, the translation says: "In its two hundred years of life, it produces three pairs of baby elephants (between the ages of thirty and ninety) ..." But Darwin's "On the Origin of Species" says that elephants start to reproduce at the age of thirty and produce six baby elephants between the ages of thirty and ninety and live to one hundred years old. Other books also say that elephants can live to one hundred and twenty years. The number "two hundred years" seems a bit large, and I suspect it is a printing error. The meaning of six baby elephants and three pairs is also different. Elephants only give birth to one calf per birth, so if you say three pairs, there is a possibility of misinterpretation as three births with twins each time. In addition, there are some typos. For example, the white spirit bird on page 181 is thought to be an error for lark. The seaweed on page 185 is thought to be an error for algae. The canine family on page 132 should be an error for the canine genus. And so on.

Also, this book is called compilation instead of translation, but it does not explain what kind of changes have been made to the original work, which needs to be explained.

    介绍“达尔文主义基本原理”
    中国科学院遗传选种实验馆、北京农业大学编译  商务印书馆出版  周建人
    本书的前言及一篇序文说明，本书系根据苏联专家给“达尔文主义研究班”编写的讲义而编译的。
    本书上册除绪论以外，分作二编。第一编是“达尔文以前的时期为进化观念的斗争”，也就是达尔文以前的进化说简史。从希腊时代讲起，到十九世纪俄国的进化论者为止。其中，对于布丰、拉马克、圣提雷尔的学说介绍得比较详细。
    第二编是“达尔文的基本学说”。从达尔文从事研究时代的英国社会背景讲起，接下去把达尔文“物种起源”里所讲到的变异性、遗传性、人工选择、自然选择、生存斗争等加以介绍和说明。最后以马克思列宁主义创始人对于达尔文主义的评价来结束。条理是很清楚的。
    本书下册也分作二编，即第三编和第四编。第三编是“在达尔文学说照耀下研究生物界的基本方法”。从古生物学上证明进化讲起，依次讲了解剖学、胚胎学等等方面对于进化的证明，中间也讲到了巴夫洛夫等的工作。这些讲述给进化论举出了比较详细的证据。
    第四编是“米丘林学说是生物科学发展的最高阶段”。主要是讲述了米丘林学说的基本原理和李森科院士的成就。对于生物体与生活条件的统一性、新陈代谢作用的真实意义、遗传性及变异性的本质等等，都作了辩证唯物论的说明。
    达尔文主义原产生于资本主义国家（英国）。但在资本主义国家里，它却被歪曲，并遭到种种恶毒的攻击。特别是在美国，有许多州禁止学校里讲授达尔文主义。若干年前，达顿地方有一位名叫斯哥布的青年教师，讲了人从猿猴类进化而来这一科学事实，竟被控诉、判罪和处罚。其无理以至于此！
    在苏联却正相反，达尔文学说是极受欢迎和重视的。列宁曾给达尔文以“把生物学第一次建立在完全科学的基础上”的好评，斯大林也曾说他和拉马克的“进化的方法使生物科学站立起来了”（原书三三一页）。本书也极推崇达尔文，说他给马克思的“哲学家们仅仅用过各种方法来解释世界而已，但是我们的工作是要改造世界”（原书四页）这句话开辟了道路！
    应该指出，本书并不只是把达尔文学说单纯地复述了一遍。完全不是这样。它把达尔文主义里正确的部分加以发扬，错误的部分加以批判和纠正。关于达尔文的错误，大家最熟知的，就是他把马尔萨斯的人口论引导到他的理论里来。本书批驳了人口照几何级数增加，食物只照算术级数增加，因此要演成人口过剩的谬论。并指出达尔文认为种内斗争是最剧烈的意见是不合事实的。本书曾引证了李森科的新颖理论。事实确实也表示得十分明白，如鼠兔的逃避本能，系用于逃避猫及狐狸等动物的追逐，而完全不用于同种个体间的斗争；虎豹的尖利的爪牙，系用以捕捉别的动物，而完全不是用来对付同种的个体的。
    达尔文虽然自己声明过，生存斗争一语含有比喻的意思（可见他自己也感觉到这用语不大适当）。但讲到生物生殖“过繁”的时候，就有“只有用生活中某一个时期遭受消灭才能够抑止的”（原书一四四页）一类的话来“解释”。因此，他的描写又很容易叫别人把生物世界看作一个残酷角斗的场所。本书明确地指出这种描写是不对的，同时也就纠正了由此而来的错误看法。书中说：“于是达尔文描写这种消灭的景象，这种描写远胜于美术家或者诗人的最勇敢的幻想力。他所描写的自然界并不是清朗而良善的，并不是我们通常所看到的和平景象的自然界，而使我们很惊异地发现一种可怕的混乱，在那里一切生物混合而纠缠在一个残酷致死的战斗中，每一个生物进入生活中都要跨过千百万与其同类者的尸体。”（原书一四四页）
    达尔文学说中的这种缺点，本书这样批评说：“达尔文在他迷惑于马尔萨斯‘理论’的时候，完全忽略了在‘物种起源’所引证的自然选择发生作用的许多例子中，繁殖过盛和因繁殖过盛而引起的竞争并不起任何作用”（原书一四六页）。“达尔文自己也感觉到他始终不能明了种的生命的问题，他写过：‘阻止每一个种数目增加的自然趋向的原因，是非常模糊的。’”（原书一四八页）
    达尔文学说中的这些缺点，是有一定的社会根源的。本书很正确地分析了达尔文的阶级出身和他所处的历史环境，说明达尔文学说中的矛盾和缺点“与资产阶级思想意识对伟大的自然科学家有害的影响是有关系的”（原书二三九页）。在资本主义社会中，残酷的竞争和人剥削人的制度占着统治地位。因此，这种资本主义社会中流行的观念，就很容易反映到达尔文的生物学著作里去。
    上面所说到的一些达尔文学说中的缺点、错误及其社会根源，只是最为人所熟知的。此外还有若干比较专门的，较少为人提及的，也顺便在此谈一谈。
    达尔文亲身和敌人作战斗的问题，就是物种变还是不变。他坚强地首先把变异是生物的普遍性这一个问题肯定下来。但他只认为生物的变异性与遗传性是自然界中很自然的事实，而对其起源和本质，则以为不容易认识，因而就没有进一步去查究。
    达尔文觉得变异的性质不容易认识，这分明是和生物体与周围的生活条件之关系没有明白了解有关的。达尔文虽相信外界条件能使生物发生变化，但有时候却又认为外界条件对于生物体只有像引物燃烧时候火花那样的作用。另外，达尔文明明看到生物的变异有缓慢的渐变，也有急遽的飞跃，但他认为新种的造成主要是由于渐变加上生存斗争与选择作用。在他的“物种起源”一书中，他一方面与特创说作着斗争，而另一方面又反复引用来布尼兹的“自然界中没有飞跃”这句错误的话，因而使书中充满了这话的意思。达尔文把生物界的变异看作是一般连续不断的微小的个体变异。他对特创说作战是胜利的，但同时也是有缺点的。正因为这样，唯心论的反对论就乘机侵入了。苏联的米丘林和李森科积极地发挥了达尔文的思想。和发展他的思想的同时，也纠正了他的有缺点的一面。本书叙述了米丘林李森科的学说，说明了生物体的能遗传的变异是在改变了的生活条件下面产生的，这意见与达尔文的意见没有什么不相同；但他们更推进了一步，说明作为生物体的特性的遗传性，不特与代谢作用密切相关连，而且生物的遗传性也只是该生物的代谢作用的类型。不同的生物有不同的代谢作用的方式，也就有不同的本性即遗传性。生物体与环境是整个的统一体。而过去的生物学却没有认识到这一点。如果认识了这一点，认识了生物体由于同化外界的东西而成为自身的东西（即内在事物），以构成其身体，那末，就能认识如果外界条件发生变化，生物当然也会发生变化这个道理了。同时，代谢作用类型发生变化，生物的本性也就发生变化的道理，也就很明白了。遗传性不仅遗传着生物前后世代的相似，也遗传着前后世代的相异。
    我前面曾说到达尔文与特创论的斗争主要只是物种变不变的问题，还没有深入说到种怎样能够变异的问题。关于解决这个问题的任务，却落在苏联的米丘林、李森科身上，而且基本上已经获得胜利了。
    在达尔文的时代，支持特创论的唯心论是失败了，但是仍有唯心论者，继承了反进步的一面，退守了第二条防线。这就是魏斯曼、莫尔干一派。他们说“遗传物质”是基本上不受外界的影响的，对身体是独立的，不变的。他们认为：“纵使个体在外界环境条件的作用下改变了的话，但是，这种改变不能影响种的历史”（原书四八三页）。显然，这与达尔文的理论是对立的。米丘林生物学不承认生物体中存在着特别的遗传物质，正如糖中不存在着另外一种甜的物质一样。“按米丘林学说，……有机体遗传特性的改变，永远仅仅是由于有机体在它所同化的外界环境条件影响下发育的改变。”
    （原书四八四页）米丘林用他的全部科学的力量进一步击败了主张遗传物质不变的唯心论，使达尔文主义获得进一步的发展。
    还有一种对于达尔文主义的发展具有极重要意义的，是对于物种的性质的明确认识。达尔文认为生物的主要变异只是缓慢的，逐渐的，而没有跳跃的。由这种变异产生的进化，也是只有量变而没有质变的。由于这种渐变的理论，也就影响了达尔文对于种的不正确的认识。达尔文认为自然界中只存在着具有变异的个体，“种”这名称是为了种种方便想像出来的。他认为种的名称不外表示一群彼此很相像的个体，与变种这一个名称本质上没有什么区别，所谓变种，不过指区别比较不显著，性状比较不稳定的类型罢了。换一句话说，即“他把种没有看成一个统一的整体，而把它当作个别个体的总数，这些个体好像仅仅为了保存它们个体的生命而实现一切的生命过程，因此它们彼此之间就不可避免地发生斗争和竞争。”（原书五三八页）
    苏联先进生物学对于种和变种却作这样看法。首先认为种由质变而形成。种是生物界链索的环节，是质上特殊的阶段，是生物界历史发展的阶段。变种也不是过渡的中间型或由此种变为他种的阶梯，它实在是种的存在形态。包含许多变种的种，能够获得多方面的适应和繁荣。前面已经说过，新的正确的学说不承认种内的斗争。进一步认识种内个体与种外个体间的关系有质的不同。如同种间的个体植物能互相授粉。变种间也是如此。
    达尔文主义既有上述的缺点和错误，为什么还要介绍它呢？因为达尔文在历史上确实有着不朽的功绩。
    达尔文的科学功绩在于他科学地解释了有机体对其生活环境条件适应的合理性。列宁说过：达尔文的著作最后把上帝从自然界赶走了，生物科学才站立了起来。达尔文说明了现代的有机界就是长期历史发展的结果，其中并没有任何上帝的力量来干涉。达尔文的著作“物种起源”在生物科学的发展中是一个历史标志，从此把生物科学引向新的时代。恩格斯在评价十九世纪的生物科学的伟大发展时写道：“应该指出达尔文强有力地打击了形而上学对于自然界的看法，因为他证明了所有的现代的生物界——植物和动物，因而人也在中——是继续千百万年发展过程的产物。”（原书二三一页）达尔文所建立的对周围有机界的解释，基本上是正确的。他完全自发地应用了发展观念，他正确地说明了有机界的历史发展过程。本书称赞他证明物种由别一些种产生，“同时也证明了生物界有它自己的历史，有它自己的过去、现在和将来。这就是达尔文理论的不朽功劳之一。”（原书五七四页）斯大林还曾经把达尔文归之于“能够不顾任何阻碍，不顾一切，摧毁旧的创造新的”（原书二三一页）这一类人。
    “生物科学在它全部的历史过程中，始终是一个尖锐思想斗争的战场。现在，在两个世界斗争的时代中，在生物科学界中唯物与唯心世界观的冲突，表现得特别明显。在最近形成了两个背道而驰的方向：一个方向为唯物的前进的米丘林方向，它的名称以伟大苏联学者、它的创始人米丘林为名的。另一个方向为反动的、唯心的魏斯曼方向，它的创始人为资产阶级的生物学家魏斯曼、孟德尔、莫尔干。”
    （原书四八二页）这里说了在为达尔文主义而斗争的两个阵营里，真理却只有一个，只在一面。唯物论的进步的达尔文主义——即指发扬与纠正过的创造性的达尔文主义——是真实的科学，唯心的反进步的魏斯曼主义是空虚的假科学。自然科学者要坚决地学真科学，不学空虚的假科学。
    我在前面曾说过，本书推崇达尔文，说他给马克思的“哲学家们仅仅用过各种方法来解释世界而已，但是我们的工作是要改造世界”这句话开辟了道路。米丘林、李森科及其拥护者已更进了一步，切切实实地进行了改造自然的工作了。
    上面把本书内容作了一个简单的介绍。还有译名方面亦顺便说一点。前些时有一位农学教授，来信告诉我说，他曾查过四种英汉字典，都把黑麦（Rye）译作裸麦；因此有些从俄文译来的书上，也把黑麦译为裸麦。这大概是查了俄英字典，然后再照英汉字典翻译的缘故。本书却是译得对的。
    但另有一些译名仍有可商榷的地方。例如Oleaeuropaea通常被译为阿列布或洋橄榄。但本书却将它译为橄榄树，这就易与生长食用青果的橄榄树混淆。一四六页上讲到达尔文计算象的生殖率时，译文说：“在它二百年的生命中它产生三对小象（在三十岁到九十岁之间）……”。但达尔文的“物种起源”里说，象三十岁开始生育，到九十岁，这中间生产小象六只，活到一百岁。他书亦有说象能活一百二十年的。“二百年”这个数字似大了一些，疑是排错的。生小象六只和三对意义亦不相同。象每产只生一只，如说三对，有误解为生三次每次双生的可能。此外，还有一些错字。例如一八一页的白灵鸟想系百灵鸟之误。一八五页上的水草想系水藻之误。一三二页上的犬科应系犬属之误。等等。
    还有，本书不称翻译而称编译，但没有说明曾对原著有何种改动，须加说明。
