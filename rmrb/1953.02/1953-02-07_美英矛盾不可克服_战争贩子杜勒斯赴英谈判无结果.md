Xinhua News Agency, London, 6th: U.S. Secretary of State Dulles and "Mutual Security Agency" Director Stassen, who are currently rushing through Western Europe, encountered an even more embarrassing cold reception in London than they did in Paris. After fruitless negotiations, Dulles and Stassen left Britain for Bonn, West Germany, on the 5th.

Dulles arrived in London from Paris on the 3rd, just as Eisenhower's decision on the Taiwan issue was causing a stir in Britain. An Associated Press dispatch from London described: "Dulles arrived in London at a time when Anglo-American relations were quite tense."

Under these circumstances, Dulles' original mission to force Britain to join the US-manufactured "European Defense Community" became even more unsatisfactory. United Press reported on the 4th: "Dulles and Stassen came to discuss Britain's contribution to European unity and the European army, but the situation turned into a case where the American representatives wanted to talk about European issues, while Britain was most concerned about Asian issues." As for the "European Defense Community" that Dulles specifically came to pull Britain into, due to fear of strong opposition from the British people and the serious threat to the interests of the British ruling class itself, Eden reiterated in the talks that Britain refused to participate, but was only willing to maintain contact. This attitude, according to United Press, was to "actually obtain the benefits of association without having to assume any responsibility."

Even before Dulles and Stassen went to London, the British showed indifference to these Wall Street envoys. When they first arrived in Europe, the British official news agency excerpted a commentary from the "Economist" magazine, an important mouthpiece of the British ruling class, criticizing Dulles' urging of vassal states in his speech on January 27th. The "Economist" magazine, in response to Dulles' threat to Britain, France, and other countries, said: "Dulles' policy is to force Britain to become a formal member of a West European federation, but Dulles' policy will be met with failure." This magazine, which has always flattered its American masters, this time plucked up the courage to say:

"There is absolutely no possibility of persuading" Britain to participate in the so-called European "alliance" planned by the United States. "American hints of possibly withdrawing aid to Europe will not only fail to make Britain willing to fully participate in Europe, but will only increase Britain's caution."

It was noted that when Dulles and his party arrived in London, British Foreign Secretary Eden did not even go to welcome them. Not only that, but the representative of the British Foreign Office who went to the airport to greet these American dignitaries was not even a cabinet-level official. This incident apparently angered the Americans. The Scripps-Howard newspaper chain in the United States specifically published an editorial entitled "Lack of Courtesy," expressing a torrent of complaints about this British reception.

The brief communique issued after Dulles and Stassen held day-long talks in London with British government leaders such as Churchill and Eden, as well as the information that was revealed, indicated that although Dulles' trip to Europe was mainly to urge the Western European vassal states to complete "European unification" as soon as possible, especially to pressure Britain to comply, the meeting turned into a quarrel between the US and Britain over the contradictions and divisions between the two countries in various regions of the entire capitalist world. The "European unification" issue that Dulles expressed the most concern about did not yield any concrete results. Even Dulles himself had to admit after the end of the talks that the hope of success for his mission was only "a little more than 50%."

    美英矛盾不可克服
    战争贩子杜勒斯赴英谈判无结果 【新华社六日讯】伦敦消息：目前正在匆匆巡视西欧各国的美国国务卿杜勒斯和“共同安全署”署长史塔生，在伦敦遭到了比他在巴黎遭到的更难堪的冷遇。在一场无结果的谈判之后，杜勒斯与史塔生已于五日离英前往西德波恩。
    杜勒斯三日从巴黎飞抵伦敦，正当艾森豪威尔所宣布的关于台湾问题的决定在英国引起骚动的时候。美联社伦敦电描写道：“杜勒斯正是在英美关系相当紧张的时刻来到伦敦。”
    在这种气氛之下，杜勒斯原来要迫使英国加入美国制造的“欧洲防务集团”的差事就更不如意了。合众社四日消息说：“杜勒斯和史塔生本来是来和英国商谈英国对欧洲统一及欧洲军的贡献的，但是情况却变成了美国代表想要谈欧洲问题，而英国最关心的却是亚洲问题。”至于杜勒斯专门来拉英国参加的“欧洲防务集团”，由于害怕英国人民的强烈反对以及对英国统治集团本身利益的严重威胁，艾登在会谈中重申英国拒绝参加，而只愿保持联系。这种态度，照合众社的说法，是想“实际上不必承担任何责任而可以获得联合的好处”。
    还在杜勒斯和史塔生没有去伦敦以前，英国人对这些华尔街的钦差大臣就表示了冷淡。当他们刚到欧洲时，英国官方的新闻处摘发了英国统治集团的重要喉舌“经济学家”杂志的一篇评论，抨击杜勒斯在一月二十七日演说中对仆从国家的吆喝。“经济学家”杂志针对杜勒斯向英、法等国所发的威胁说：“杜勒斯的政策就是迫使英国成为西欧联邦的一个正式成员，但是杜勒斯的政策将遭遇失败。”这个一向谄媚美国主人的杂志这次鼓足了勇气说：
    “绝对没有可能说服”英国参加美国所策划的那种所谓欧洲的“联盟”。“美国暗示可能撤销对欧洲的援助，非但不能使英国愿意全面参加欧洲，反而只能增加英国的谨慎。”
    有人注意到，在杜勒斯一行抵达伦敦时，英国外相艾登竟没有去欢迎，不仅如此，英国外交部到机场迎接这些美国贵宾的代表甚至还不是阁员级的官员。这件事显然使得美国人老羞成怒。美国斯克里浦斯—霍华德系报纸专门发表了一篇题为“没有礼貌”的社论，对于英国这种接待大发了一通牢骚。
    杜勒斯和史塔生在伦敦与邱吉尔、艾登等英国政府首脑会谈整日后发表的简短的会议公报以及透露出来的情况表明，虽然杜勒斯欧洲之行主要是为了鞭策西欧仆从国家从速完成“欧洲统一”，其中特别是压迫英国就范，但会议却成了美英关于两国在整个资本主义世界各个地区中的矛盾和分歧的争吵，而杜勒斯表示最关心的“欧洲统一”问题却没有得到任何具体结果。甚至杜勒斯本人在结束会谈后也不得不承认，他的使命成功的希望还不过“五成以上”。
