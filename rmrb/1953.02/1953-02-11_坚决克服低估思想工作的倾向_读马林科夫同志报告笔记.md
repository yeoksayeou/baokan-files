Resolutely Overcome the Tendency to Underestimate Ideological Work
——Notes on Reading Comrade Malenkov's Report
Sun Dingguo

	In the third part of the summary report made by Comrade Malenkov at the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, he analyzed various important issues of the Party's work. In his report, Comrade Malenkov gave great importance to the Party's ideological work. He said: "Ideological work is the primary responsibility of the Party, and neglecting this work may cause irreparable damage to the interests of the Party and the state. We must always remember that any weakening of the influence of socialist ideology is a strengthening of the influence of bourgeois ideology." Comrade Malenkov criticized one of the many shortcomings of the Party's work as "many Party organizations underestimate the importance of ideological work, therefore, this work falls behind the Party's tasks." He pointed out: "The task of the Party organization is to resolutely eliminate this harmful tendency to underestimate the importance of ideological work, and to strengthen ideological work in all aspects of the Party and the state, and to relentlessly expose all manifestations of ideas that run counter to Marxism."

	The issue raised by Comrade Malenkov here is not only one of the important guarantees for the Soviet Communist Party to lead its country from socialism to communism; but also has realistic guiding significance for the current ideological work of our Party. We should regard it as an extremely important component of learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, just like economic work.

	Under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, our Party has always placed the Party's ideological work in the primary position. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "As long as we can grasp the science of Marxism-Leninism, trust the masses, closely unite with the masses, and lead them forward, we are fully capable of overcoming any obstacles and defeating any difficulties, and our strength is invincible." (See "The Current Situation and Our Tasks") This is exactly the case. Under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, our Party has long adhered to the revolutionary critical spirit of Marxism-Leninism, waged a tenacious struggle against all anti-Marxist-Leninist ideologies, and achieved the victory of the Chinese revolution. Our Party's ideological work has created extremely rich experience both in mass education work and in Party branch education work; and there have been many new developments in this area since the founding of the People's Republic of China. Today, the ideological work of Party organizations seems to be more mass-based than ever before.

	However, can we say that there are no problems in the ideological work of our Party organizations? Can we say that our ideological work has completely adapted to the requirements of the Party's political tasks and organizational tasks, that is, completely meets the requirements of the people of the whole country? No! That is not the case. We should see another aspect of the ideological work of Party organizations, that is, the harmful tendency to underestimate the importance of ideological work, as pointed out by Comrade Malenkov, which exists within our Party.
                    ××××
	The manifestations of our Party's underestimation of the role of ideological work are by no means isolated. Many comrades mistakenly believe that theory cannot solve practical problems and adopt a passive attitude towards theoretical study. The political and ideological education of the working class since the national liberation has not been entirely satisfactory. One of the most prominent shortcomings is that for a period of time, we generally did not systematically conduct education on communism and the Communist Party among the working masses. Some leading cadres of factories and mines even dared not publicize communism and the Communist Party among the working masses, and dared not publicize that the working class's mass organization - the trade union - must accept the leadership of the Communist Party; but only one-sidedly publicized purely welfare viewpoints (of course, paying attention to workers' welfare is a very important work), and simply used the method of issuing bonuses to promote workers' production. This approach is not beneficial to improving the class consciousness of the working masses. This makes it difficult for the working masses to understand the fundamental truth that the national interest under the leadership of the working class is the greatest interest of the working class. This cannot establish the working class's sense of ownership on the ideological foundation of communism. The purely welfare viewpoint is an ideological manifestation of "economism," and on the ideological foundation of "economism," it is impossible to produce the working class's true sense of ownership. It should be pointed out that this is an ideological tendency of trade unionism that was once sharply criticized by Lenin and has always been opposed by our Party.

	Regarding political and ideological education work in rural areas, we should also admit that after the land reform, our education on the socialist future of the vast number of peasants was not popular and in-depth enough. This is not only manifested in the fact that after the land reform, the "Li Sixi-style" "retreat" thinking among rural activists and cadres has grown anew in some areas and has not been overcome in time; it is also not only manifested in the fact that some places have not closely combined the bumper harvest movement in rural areas with patriotic education, but also in the fact that some comrades have not promptly conducted mutual aid and cooperation education for rural party members and peasants after the land reform. And this education is precisely one of the most basic contents of rural political and ideological education after the land reform. Because many people have ignored this education, they are surprised by the serious situation of new class differentiation in rural areas (of course, this is an inevitable situation) and make the work fall into a passive position.

	In universities and middle schools, we also see serious phenomena of weak political and ideological education work. There is a tendency among some students to despise political education, and a small number of people with political problems in individual schools are responsible for the ideological education of young people. Some natural science research institutions also allow people who oppose materialism to openly or secretly resist the advanced theories of Pavlov or Michurin, and some people are even clamoring for the fallacy that "scientists do not understand philosophy, and philosophers do not understand science. It is impossible to argue clearly, so it is better to live in peace with each other," and have not been duly criticized. In literary and art circles, there have also been erroneous tendencies to accommodate bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideas, and there is also the so-called slogan of "closer unity and bolder creation," which in essence is to abandon the leadership of proletarian ideology on the literary and art front. The production, screening, and propaganda of the movie "The Life of Wu Xun" has long become the most prominent example known to all.

	Regarding ideological education within the Party, especially the work of conducting relatively systematic Marxist-Leninist education for party members and probationary party members, there is still a very infrequent phenomenon. For example, the director of the study committee of the Northwest Construction Engineering General Administration Preparatory Office adopted a bureaucratic attitude towards cadre study, saying "It doesn't matter if you can't understand it." After the shocking "Ji Kaifu incident" and the shocking "Zhang Shunyou incident," some people continued to develop their bureaucratic and commandist erroneous behaviors. One of the reasons why some of our party members repeatedly repeat the same type of mistakes they have made is because they still lack Marxist-Leninist education.

	In short, the tendency to underestimate ideological work that Comrade Malenkov pointed out in his report as existing within the Communist Party of the Soviet Union also exists within our Party, and is even more serious.

	The reasons for this phenomenon are certainly multifaceted, but as Comrade Malenkov said: "Underestimating the importance of ideological work is largely the result of some of our leading cadres not striving to improve their awareness, enrich their Marxist-Leninist knowledge, and absorb the historical experience of the Party."

	Here, we naturally think of what Comrade Mao Zedong said in the article "The Position of the Chinese Communist Party in the National War": "Generally speaking, all Communist Party members with considerable research ability should study the theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, study the history of our nation, and study the current situation and trends of the movement; and educate those party members with lower cultural levels through them. In particular, cadres should focus on studying these, and Central Committee members and senior cadres should especially intensify their studies. A political party that guides a great revolutionary movement cannot achieve victory without revolutionary theory, historical knowledge, and a deep understanding of the actual movement." Comrade Mao Zedong here does not place the theoretical study of Marxism-Leninism by the Party's leading cadres in a general position, but in a special position. What does this mean? This means that the responsible cadres of the Party have the responsibility to implement the Party's policies, and without the study of Marxism-Leninism, it is impossible to deeply understand the Party's policies, and therefore it is impossible to accurately grasp the Party's policies; the responsible cadres of the Party should not only demand lower-level cadres in their work, but also lead and educate lower-level cadres ideologically. It is true that there are some leading workers in our Party who are loyal to the Party and active in their work, but the work they lead often has little effect, or even a very bad effect. What is the reason for this? It should be admitted that this is due to the fact that these comrades have not resolutely implemented Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions on earnestly studying the theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin. These comrades have never paid much attention to the Party's ideological work, and they have ignored the guiding significance of theory for practice. They often only pay attention to work, but not to study, so that they turn study and discussion meetings into work discussion meetings. They have the erroneous view that study and work are opposed to each other. They are "busy with their hands" on the one hand, and "idle with their brains" on the other. The work method of focusing on routine tasks and the ideological method of empiricism firmly bind the minds of these comrades and cannot be freed. Precisely because they do not yet understand the importance of ideological work, they rarely think about how to strengthen the Party's ideological work among the masses. These comrades have not yet deeply understood that as a leading cadre of the Party, it is far from enough to have only general class consciousness and revolutionary enthusiasm. We also need to have a higher level of class consciousness under the guidance of the scientific theory of Marxism-Leninism. The higher the level of awareness based on scientific theory, the more stable the grasp of the Party's policies, the stronger the work efficiency; the more powerful the grasp of the Party's ideological work, the faster the political progress of cadres and the masses. This truth has been fully proven by many experiences within the Party.

	Recently, theoretical study for senior cadres has been widely launched throughout the country. The number of senior cadres participating in the study of Comrade Stalin's "Economic Problems of Socialism in the Soviet Union" and the documents of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, as well as the depth reached in the study, are unprecedented in the Party, and many model units and model comrades have emerged. The great results of this study movement can be expected, and it will inevitably greatly help the further strengthening of the Party's ideological work.

	Our country is currently starting the large-scale construction of the Five-Year Plan. This huge construction has given all ideological workers of the Party a major historical task: requiring all ideological workers to be good at serving it and to conduct arduous struggles for its complete victory. The greater the victory of economic construction, the higher the requirements for ideological construction. Without the victory of Marxist-Leninist ideological construction, there can be no victory in socialist economic construction. More than fifty years ago, Lenin said: "...It can only be like this: Is it the bourgeois ideological system? Or the socialist ideological system? There is no middle ground here... Therefore, any contempt for and any abandonment of the socialist ideological system is to strengthen the bourgeois ideological system." Lenin's famous saying has long become an unwavering pointer for the ideological workers of the Soviet Party. And for the ideological workers of our Party, this is also an extremely valuable instruction. Although our country is still a New Democratic country, and our country's culture is still a New Democratic culture; however, the New Democratic system is a component of the world proletarian socialist revolution. Therefore, our ideological work must adhere to the socialist ideological system and conduct an irreconcilable struggle against the bourgeois ideological system. The experience of our country over the past three years has told us that if we do not use the Marxist-Leninist world outlook as a tool for observing the destiny of the country, and do not use the scientific theory of Marxism-Leninism to educate the Party's cadres and people, our country cannot achieve such great victories as it has today. Didn't we encounter the antagonism between bourgeois reformist ideas and proletarian revolutionary ideas in the construction of our country? The antagonism between "peaceful land distribution" and class struggle manifested in the land reform, the antagonism between unprincipled leniency and principled leniency manifested in the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the antagonism between the viewpoint of worshipping Europe and America and the acceptance of advanced Soviet experience manifested in economic construction, and the antagonism between reformist ideas and revolutionary ideas manifested in the criticism of "The Life of Wu Xun," all of which, if there had been no victory of proletarian revolutionaryism and no victory of Marxism-Leninism, would have caused great losses to the country and the people!

	The ranks of our Party's ideological workers are not only insufficient in number, but also in quality - our Marxist-Leninist cultivation level is also very uneven and not high enough. We should bravely admit that the Party's ideological front still lacks the revolutionary fighting spirit of Marxist-Leninist criticism it should have. The remaining tendencies of dogmatism and formalism have not been completely overcome in our ranks. This cannot but be said to be one of the important reasons why the Party's ideological work lags behind the Party's political tasks. Therefore, strengthening the study of Marxism-Leninism by the Party's ideological workers has become one of the important conditions for strengthening the Party's ideological work. Only when the Marxist-Leninist ideological level of the Party's ideological workers is improved can we more powerfully carry out the Party's propaganda and mobilization work to improve the ideological cultivation of communists and improve the political vigilance and political consciousness of workers, peasants, and intellectuals. "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy" (Chinese version No. 176) wrote in the article "The Invincible Power of Marxist-Leninist Theory": "To improve the ideological work level of the Communist and Workers' Parties, it is impossible to imagine not systematically, persistently, and deeply studying the classic works of Marxism-Leninism, and not openly and boldly publicizing the important viewpoints of contemporary advanced theory to all audiences from all forums every day. The more deeply the Party's cadres accept these viewpoints, the more they can apply them to the practice of specific environments, the higher the level of the Party's ideological work, and the more effective the propaganda of Marxist-Leninist ideas carried out among the masses. To achieve this, it is only possible to adopt a creative rather than formal and dogmatic learning attitude when drawing on the priceless treasure of Marxist-Leninist ideas." This should become one of the best mottoes for the ideological workers of our Party.

    坚决克服低估思想工作的倾向
    ——读马林科夫同志报告笔记
    孙定国
    马林科夫同志在苏联共产党第十九次代表大会上所作的总结报告的第三部分中，分析了党的工作的各个重要问题。马林科夫同志在他的报告中对于党的思想工作，给予了极大的重视。他说：“思想工作是党的首要职责，不重视这种工作就可能给党和国家的利益造成无法弥补的损失。我们必须时刻记住，社会主义思想影响的任何削弱，都是资产阶级思想影响的增强。”马林科夫同志批评了党的工作的许多缺点之一就是“许多党组织低估了思想工作的重要性，因此，这种工作就落在党的任务后面”。他指出：“党组织的任务，在于坚决消灭这种低估思想工作之重要性的有害偏向，并在党和国家的各个环节中加强思想工作，不懈地揭露一切与马克思主义背道而驰的思想的表现。”
    马林科夫同志在这里所提出的问题不仅是苏联共产党领导自己国家从社会主义过渡到共产主义的重要保证之一；而且对于目前我们党的思想工作说来，同样地也是具有现实的指导意义的。我们应该把它如同经济工作一样，作为学习苏联先进经验的极为重要的组成部分之一。
    我们党在毛泽东同志领导下，从来就是把党的思想工作放在首要地位的。毛泽东同志说：“只要我们能够掌握马克思列宁主义的科学，信任群众，紧紧地和群众一道，并领导他们前进，我们是完全能够超越任何障碍与战胜任何困难的，我们的力量是无敌的。”（见“目前形势和我们的任务”）事实正是这样。我们党在毛泽东同志领导之下，长期地坚持着马克思列宁主义底革命的批判的精神，与一切反马克思列宁主义的思潮进行了顽强的斗争，取得了中国革命的胜利。我们党的思想工作，无论在群众教育工作以及在党的支部教育工作中都创造了极为丰富的经验；中华人民共和国成立以来，在这一方面更有许多新的发展。在今天看起来，党组织的思想工作已经是比任何时期都带有广大的群众性了。
    但是，能不能说我们党组织的思想工作没有问题了呢？能不能说我们的思想工作已经完全适合于党的政治任务和组织任务的要求，也就是完全符合于全国人民的要求了呢？不！不是这样。我们应该看到党组织的思想工作的另一个方面，这就是我们党内所存在着的如同马林科夫同志所指出的低估思想工作的重要性的有害偏向。
                    ××××
    我们党内低估思想工作作用的表现完全不是个别的。许多同志错误地认为理论不能解决实际问题，对于理论学习采取消极态度。全国解放以来对于工人阶级的政治思想教育工作，就是不能完全令人满意的。其中最突出的缺点之一就是曾经有一个时期，我们在工人群众中系统地进行共产主义与共产党的教育一般是不够的。甚至有的工厂、矿山的领导干部，不敢在工人群众中宣传共产主义和共产党，不敢宣传工人阶级的群众组织——工会必须接受共产党的领导；而只是片面地宣传单纯福利观点（当然注意工人福利是非常重要的工作），单纯使用发给奖金的办法，去推动工人进行生产。这种做法对于工人群众阶级觉悟的提高并无好处。这样就会使工人群众难于认识在工人阶级领导下的国家利益就是工人阶级的最大利益的根本道理。这样就不能把工人阶级主人翁的觉悟建立在共产主义的思想基础之上。单纯福利观点是“经济主义”的思想表现，而在“经济主义”的思想基础之上，是不可能产生工人阶级的真正主人翁的觉悟的。应该指出：这是一种为列宁所曾经尖锐批判过的而且是我们党历来反对过的工联主义的思想倾向。
    关于农村的政治思想教育工作，我们也应该承认，在土地改革以后，我们对于广大农民的社会主义前途的教育是不够普及和深入的。这不仅表现在土地改革后，农村积极分子及干部中的“李四喜式”的“退坡”思想，在某些地区有了新的滋长，未能及时克服；也不仅表现在有的地方对于农村的丰产运动没有和爱国主义的教育紧密地结合起来，而且也还表现在土地改革后有些同志没有及时地向农村党员和农民进行互助合作的教育。而这种教育，恰恰是土地改革后的农村政治思想教育的最基本的内容之一。因为许多人忽视了这个教育，才会对于农村中新的阶级分化的严重情况（当然这是一种不可避免的情况）感到惊讶，并使工作陷于被动。
    在大、中学校中，我们也看到政治思想教育工作薄弱的严重现象。部分学生中存在着一种轻视政治教育的倾向，个别学校中曾有少数政治上有问题的人担负着对青年的思想教育工作，某些自然科学研究机关也听任反对唯物主义观点的人在或明或暗地对抗着巴夫洛夫或米丘林的先进学说，甚至还有人在叫嚷着“科学家不懂哲学，哲学家也不懂科学，那是吵不清楚的，还是相安无事为妙”的谬论，而没有受到应有的批判。在文艺界中也曾经发生过迁就资产阶级和小资产阶级思想的错误倾向，还有所谓“更亲密的团结，更勇敢的创造”的口号，其实质也就是放弃无产阶级思想在文艺战线上的领导权。电影“武训传”的摄制、放映和宣传，更早已成为人所共知的最突出的例子。
    关于党内的思想教育，特别是对党员和候补党员进行比较系统的马克思列宁主义教育的工作，仍然存在着极不经常的现象。例如，西北建筑工程总管理处筹备处学委会主任，对于干部学习就采取了“学不懂就算了”的官僚主义的态度。在惊人的“纪凯夫事件”和惊人的“张顺有事件”之后，竟然还继续有人在发展着他们的官僚主义和命令主义的错误行为。我们的某些党员同志一次又一次地重复自己所曾经犯过的同类性质的错误，其原因之一，就是由于他们还缺乏马克思列宁主义的教育。
    总之，马林科夫同志报告中所指出的，在苏联共产党内所存在着低估思想工作的倾向，在我们党内也同样地，而且是比较更严重地存在着。
    产生这种现象的原因，固然是多方面的，但是也正如马林科夫同志所说：“低估思想工作的重要性在很大程度上是我们一部分领导干部没有努力提高自己的觉悟、充实马克思列宁主义的知识和吸取党的历史经验的结果。”
    在这里，我们很自然地会联想到毛泽东同志在“中国共产党在民族战争中的地位”一文中所说的一段话：“一般地说，一切有相当研究能力的共产党员，都要研究马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的理论，都要研究我们民族的历史，都要研究当前运动的情况和趋势；并经过他们去教育那些文化水准较低的党员。特殊地说，干部应该着重地研究这些，中央委员和高级干部尤其应当加紧研究。指导一个伟大的革命运动的政党，如果没有革命理论，没有历史知识，没有对于实际运动的深刻的了解，要取得胜利是不可能的。”毛泽东同志在这里不是把党的领导干部对于马克思列宁主义的理论学习放在一般的地位之上，而是放在特殊的地位之上来处理的。这是什么意思呢？这就是说，党的负责干部是负有贯彻党的政策的责任的，而没有马克思列宁主义的学习，是不可能深刻地理解党的政策，因而也不可能准确地掌握党的政策的；党的负责干部不应只在工作上要求下级干部，而也应该在思想上领导和教育下级干部。我们党内确实有一部分领导工作者，他们对党是忠诚的，工作是积极的，但是，他们所领导的工作，却往往是效果不大，甚至于效果很不好。这原因究竟在那里呢？应该承认，这是由于这些同志还没有坚决地贯彻毛泽东同志关于认真地学习马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林理论的指示的结果。这些同志向来是不十分注意党的思想工作的，他们忽视了理论对于实践的指导意义。他们往往是只注意工作，而不注意学习，以至把学习讨论会变成工作讨论会。他们存在着学习与工作对立的错误观点。他们一方面是“手忙脚乱”，一方面又是“头脑清闲”。事务主义的工作方法，经验主义的思想方法，死死地束缚着这些同志的思想而不能解脱。正是由于自己还不懂得思想工作的重要，他们也就很少想到如何加强党在群众中的思想工作。这些同志至今还没有深刻地了解：作为党的一个领导干部来说，仅仅具有一般的阶级觉悟和革命热情，还是远远不够的。我们还需要具有更高的在马克思列宁主义科学理论指导下的阶级觉悟。这种建立在科学理论基础上的觉悟程度越高，掌握党的政策就越稳，工作效率也就越强；掌握党的思想工作越有力，干部和群众的政治进步也就越快。这个道理已被党内的许多经验所完全证明了。
    最近全国普遍开展了高级干部的理论学习。参加学习斯大林同志“苏联社会主义经济问题”和苏联共产党第十九次代表大会文件的高级干部的数量，以及在学习中所达到的深度，都是党内空前未有的，并涌现出了不少的模范单位和模范同志。这个学习运动的伟大成果是可以预期的，它必然大大有助于党的思想工作进一步的加强。
    我们的国家目前正在开始大规模的五年计划的建设。这个巨大的建设赋予了党的一切思想工作者以重大的历史任务：要求一切思想工作者，要善于为它服务，并为它的彻底胜利而进行艰苦的斗争。经济建设的胜利越大，对于思想建设的要求也就越高，没有马克思列宁主义思想建设的胜利，就不可能有社会主义经济建设的胜利。列宁在五十多年前就说过：“……只能是这样：是资产阶级的思想体系呢？还是社会主义的思想体系呢？这里没有什么中间的道路……因此，对于社会主义思想体系的任何轻视与任何离弃，都是加强资产阶级思想体系的。”列宁的这个名言，早就成了苏联党的思想工作者坚持不渝的指针。而对于我们党的思想工作者说来，这同样是极其宝贵的指示。虽然，我们的国家还是新民主主义的国家，我们国家的文化还是新民主主义的文化；但是，新民主主义制度，是属于无产阶级社会主义世界革命的组成部分的。因此，我们的思想工作就必须坚持社会主义的思想体系，并对于资产阶级的思想体系，进行着不调和的斗争。我国三年来的经验已经告诉了我们：如果不以马克思列宁主义的世界观作为观察国家命运的工具，不以马克思列宁主义的科学理论教育党的干部和人民，我们的国家就不能够取得像今天这样伟大的胜利。难道在我们国家的建设工作中，不曾遇到资产阶级改良主义的思想和无产阶级的革命主义思想的对抗吗？在土地改革中所表现出来的“和平分田”与阶级斗争的对抗，在镇压反革命中所表现出来的无原则的宽大与有原则的宽大的对抗，在经济建设中所表现出来的崇拜欧美的观点与接受苏联先进经验的对抗，在“武训传”的批判中所表现出来的改良主义思想与革命主义思想的对抗，这一切如果没有无产阶级革命主义的胜利，没有马克思列宁主义的胜利，就将给国家和人民造成多大的损失！
    我们党的思想工作者的队伍，不仅在数量上表现了人手不多，而且还表现在质量上——我们的马克思列宁主义的修养水平，也是十分不高和不齐的。我们应该勇敢地承认，党的思想战线还缺乏应有的马克思列宁主义的批判的革命的战斗精神。教条主义和公式主义的残余倾向，在我们的队伍里还没有完全被克服。这不能不说是党的思想工作落后于党的政治任务的重要原因之一。因此，加强党的思想工作者对马克思列宁主义的学习，就成了加强党的思想工作的重要条件之一。只有党的思想工作者的马克思列宁主义的思想水平提高了，才能更有力地进行党的宣传鼓动工作，来改善共产党员的思想修养，提高工人、农民和知识分子的政治警惕性和政治觉悟。“争取持久和平，争取人民民主”（中文版一七六期）在“马克思列宁主义理论的无敌力量”一文中写道：“要提高共产党和工人党的思想工作水平，就不能设想不去系统地、坚持地、深刻地学习马克思列宁主义经典著作，不去每天从一切讲坛上向一切听众公开而大胆地宣传当代先进理论的重要论点。党的干部接受这些论点越是深刻，就越能把它们应用到具体环境的实践中去，党的思想工作水平就越高，在群众中进行的马克思列宁主义思想的宣传就越有效。而要做到这一点，只有在汲取马克思列宁主义思想的无价宝藏时，采取创造性的而不是形式的和教条主义的学习态度。”这应当成为我们党的思想工作者最好的座右铭之一。
