Liaoxi Province: In the process of mobilizing workers and staff to discuss production plans in some state-owned and local state-owned factories and mines, the leading cadres, due to their lack of deep understanding of the importance of formulating production plans this year and their lack of faith in the working class, failed to earnestly conduct propaganda and education among the workers and staff, and mobilize them to tap potential, resulting in formalistic phenomena. Before the discussion of the plan at the Yangzhangzi Mine, there was insufficient preparation. The administrative leaders simply announced the production targets at the factory management committee meeting and then handed them over to the workers for discussion. At the beginning of the plan discussion, the workers were relatively serious and raised some specific questions, but no one was responsible for studying and solving them, which dampened the workers' enthusiasm. When individual workers reflected that the state's targets were too high, the leading cadres of the mine did not patiently persuade and explain to the workers, but instead used a commanding tone, saying, "That's just the way it is, it won't work if you don't complete it, this is the law of the country!" As a result, the workers became even more afraid, fearing that if the plan was set too high and they couldn't complete it, they would end up in "court." The leading cadres of the Fourth Paper Mill simply announced the production plan at the workers' congress and then let the workers discuss it. Because the workers did not understand the importance of discussing the plan or the methods of discussion, they were not very enthusiastic. The workers regarded the discussion of the plan as a burden, and few people put forward rationalization proposals. Even if someone did, the leading cadres ignored them. The Liaoxi Tannery simply announced the plan to the workers and that was it. The trade union did not even know about the discussion of the plan, so after the plan reached the groups, the workers could not put forward any opinions, and the entire factory's plan was "approved" in this way.

In addition, it was also discovered in the discussion of the plan that some factories and mines lacked a comprehensive view of fulfilling the state plan. For example, most factories and mines in Jinzhou only discussed the total output value plan, but not the quality, cost, variety, and other plans.

The Liaoxi Daily published a short commentary entitled "Oppose Bureaucracy and Formalism in Planning," pointing out that mobilizing the masses to discuss plans is to further tap potential, find shortcuts, promote advanced experiences, and make the plans more advanced and improved, so as to create and accumulate more wealth for the country; and through mass discussion, the national plan is truly transformed into the masses' own plan. Therefore, in the discussion of plans, we must oppose bureaucratic and formalistic practices. Because only plans that have been carefully discussed and formulated by the masses are truly advanced plans that can fully unleash industrial potential.

    辽西省部分国营厂矿领导干部缺乏依靠群众思想
    讨论生产计划中产生形式主义的偏向
    【本报讯】辽西省部分国营和地方国营厂矿，在发动职工群众讨论生产计划中，由于领导干部没有深刻地认识到今年制订生产计划的重要意义，缺乏依靠工人阶级的思想，没有能认真地对职工进行宣传教育，发动职工挖掘潜力，所以产生了形式主义的现象。杨杖子矿在讨论计划前，没有作充分准备，只是在工厂管理委员会上由行政领导干部宣布了生产指标，接着就交给职工讨论。在讨论计划之初，工人们比较认真，提出了一些具体问题，但却没有人负责去研究和解决，这就打击了工人的积极性。有个别工人反映国家指标高，该矿领导干部不是耐心地向职工进行说服解释，却用命令的口吻说：“就是这么多，不完成不行，这是国家法律！”这样一来，使得工人更害怕了，只怕计划订高了完不成进“法院”。第四造纸厂领导干部只是在职工大会上宣布了生产计划，就让工友们讨论，因为职工不了解讨论计划的重要性和讨论的方法，所以劲头都不大，工人们把讨论计划当成负担，很少有人提出合理化建议，即使有人提出来，领导干部也不闻不问。辽西制革厂只是把计划向工人宣布一下就完了，工会连讨论计划的事都不知道，所以计划到小组里后，工人们也提不出什么意见来，就这样“通过”了全厂计划。
    另外，在讨论计划中，也发现了有些厂矿缺乏全面完成国家计划的观点，如锦州市大部分厂矿只讨论了生产总值计划，对质量、成本、品种等计划却没有讨论。
    辽西日报为此发表了题为“反对订计划当中的官僚主义和形式主义”的短评，指出发动群众讨论计划，是为了进一步挖潜力、找窍门，推广先进经验，使计划更加先进、更加提高，为国家创造和积累更多的财富；并通过群众讨论，把国家计划真正变成群众自己的计划。因此，在讨论计划当中，我们就要反对那种官僚主义与形式主义的做法。因为只有经过群众认真讨论和制订的计划，才是真正能充分发挥工业潜力的先进计划。
