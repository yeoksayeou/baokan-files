    Xinhua News Agency, 3rd: Vietnam News Agency reported on the 2nd: The Vietnam People's Army is intensifying operations in the plains of North Vietnam, crushing all French "mopping-up" operations. In Nam Dinh province, local People's Army forces and guerrillas fought French troops attacking Gia Trang and Vu Xa villages. After nine hours of combat, the People's Army repelled the attack by approximately 2,000 French troops supported by 75 motorcycles and 15 aircraft, annihilating 280 French soldiers. From January 9th to 15th, the People's Army also crushed several enemy "mopping-up" operations in the south of Giao Thuy district, killing 135 French soldiers and wounding 14.

    In Thai Binh province, the People's Army removed the French stronghold of Quynh Coi on January 17th, killing and capturing 180 French soldiers and seizing all their weapons.
    Xinhua News Agency, Prague: The French newspaper "L'Humanité" published on January 26th a letter from Rabet, a municipal council member of Pierrefitte-sur-Seine, to the city's mayor, the Communist Loucher Friville, calling for opposition to the war of aggression against Vietnam. Mr. and Mrs. Rabet are deeply grieved because their son recently died on the battlefield in Vietnam.

    "L'Humanité" published an editorial saying: Nothing illustrates the issue better than this. The whole nation considers the war against Vietnam to be a crime, and the whole nation is condemning this war. The editorial pointed out that the French people's sentiment against this unjust colonial war has been rising. This war has prompted the French bourgeois authorities to persecute outstanding peace fighters like Henri Martin, Alain Le Leap, Guy Ducoloné and their comrades. The authorities have taken these unconstitutional measures in an attempt to make the people support this unpopular war. But this only confirms to the French people the fact that the French government feels it necessary to "clean up" its rear because it is conducting such a war. Such a foreign war fosters domestic fascism.

    "L'Humanité" finally called on the French people to further strengthen unity, strengthen action, and force the bourgeoisie to end this war.

    越南人民军粉碎法军进攻
    法国“人道报”呼吁结束侵越战争 【新华社三日讯】据越南通讯社二日讯：越南人民军在北越平原加紧作战，粉碎法军的一切“扫荡”。在南定省，人民军地方部队和游击队与进攻嘉庄和武赛村的法军作战。经过九小时的战斗，人民军击退了这支由七十五辆摩托车辆和十五架飞机支援的约二千名法军的进攻。歼灭法军二百八十人。一月九日到十五日，人民军又在交水县南部粉碎敌军的几次“扫荡”，打死法军一百三十五人，打伤十四人。
    在太平省，人民军在一月十七日拔除了琼瑰的法军据点，毙俘法军一百八十人，缴获全部武器。 【新华社布拉格讯】法国“人道报”一月二十六日发表了塞纳省彼埃尔菲特市市政委员拉贝写给该市市长、共产党人卢歇·弗里维的信，呼吁反对侵略越南的战争。拉贝夫妇因为他们的儿子最近在越南战场上牺牲，非常悲痛。
    “人道报”发表社论说：再也没有什么比这件事情更能说明问题了。对越南作战，全国人民认为是罪恶，全国人民都在谴责这个战争。社论指出，法国人民反对这个非正义的殖民战争的情绪已日益高涨，这个战争已促使法国资产阶级当局迫害像亨利·马丁、阿兰·勒里普、居伊杜科朗这样卓越的和平战士和他们的战友们。当局为了力图叫人民拥护这个不得人心的战争才采取了这些违反宪法的措施。但是这正好向法国人民证实了这件事实，即法国政府因为进行了这样的一个战争，才感到有“肃清”它的后方的必要。这样的一个国外战争培植了国内的法西斯主义。
    “人道报”最后号召法国人民进一步加强团结，加强行动，迫使资产阶级结束这个战争。
