    Northeast Party and Government Rural Work Departments Decide to Universally Promote the Zhaoyuan County High-Yield Experience
    [This Newspaper News] The Rural Work Department of the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and the former Agricultural Department of the Northeast People's Government jointly invited comrades from the Rural Work Departments of the CPC Provincial Committees of the Northeast Provinces and the Agricultural Departments of the Northeast Provincial People's Governments, as well as responsible comrades from some county committees and county governments, to a forum from January 16th to 18th to specifically study the issue of promoting the Zhaoyuan County high-yield experience. In addition to reporting on the situation at the meeting, the focus was on discussing whether the Zhaoyuan high-yield experience could be promoted in areas outside Heilongjiang Province and how to carry out the promotion work. Many county comrades introduced their typical experiences in this regard and criticized and examined their incorrect understanding of the Zhaoyuan experience. During the meeting, Comrade Lin Feng, First Deputy Secretary of the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, gave important instructions.
    The facts in various parts of Northeast China show that the Zhaoyuan high-yield experience is applicable to all parts of Northeast China. The problem lies in whether the leading cadres, especially the county leading cadres, have understood the essence of the Zhaoyuan high-yield experience, studied and researched the farming techniques of Zhaoyuan County, and conscientiously summarized the local high-yield experience and combined it with the Zhaoyuan experience.
    Many county comrades used sufficient facts at the meeting to illustrate this point. In Acheng County, Songjiang Province, the leadership initially had different opinions on whether the Zhaoyuan high-yield experience could be promoted locally. Some believed that it could be fully promoted, some believed that it could not be promoted at all due to different soil conditions, and some believed that it could be tried; but none of these three views were based on sufficient evidence. In order to solve this problem, they started by investigating and summarizing the local high-yield experience. After investigation and summary, it was found that all the groups and households that achieved high yields implemented wide sowing, thinning, and seedling protection, which was basically consistent with the Zhaoyuan experience. This confirmed that the Zhaoyuan experience could be fully promoted in Acheng. Yongji and Jiutai in Jilin Province, and Dongfeng and Liaoyuan (Xi'an) in Liaodong Province also adopted the same method and came to the same conclusion. Moreover, there are already many farmers' sayings that describe the reasons for increased and decreased production, which are consistent with the Zhaoyuan experience. Comrades from the Rural Work Department of the CPC Rehe Provincial Committee believed that the high-yield technical experience of Zhaoyuan County also needed to be fully promoted in Rehe Province. The natural conditions in Rehe Province and Heilongjiang Province differ greatly, and it has always been believed that farming is relatively meticulous; however, according to surveys, general crops in Rehe Province are still short of seedlings by 20 percent. Many groups and societies that achieved high yields last year did so because they improved cultivation techniques, with full and good seedlings. For example, the cotton of the Huang Yuanling Agricultural Production Cooperative, which produced 841 catties per mu (Northeast mu, equivalent to 1.5 city mu), was still short of seedlings, with only 5,680 plants per mu; if it could reach 8,000 plants per mu, it would be entirely possible to obtain a yield of more than 1,000 catties.
    Many county comrades used concrete and vivid facts to illustrate the great impact of the Zhaoyuan high-yield experience on the current rural work after it was accepted by the peasants. The implementation of the Zhaoyuan cultivation method must have a corresponding organizational form. Therefore, the promotion of the Zhaoyuan cultivation method has promoted the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement. Before the Spring Festival, many farmers voluntarily requested to rectify and improve the mutual aid teams, which had never happened in the Northeast before. According to statistics from eight counties in Songjiang Province, 9,000 mutual aid teams (accounting for more than 30 percent of the total number of mutual aid teams in the eight counties) have been rectified, expanded in scope, improved various systems, and formulated high-yield plans for implementing the Zhaoyuan cultivation method, actively carrying out winter sideline production and material preparations for this year's production. In Yongji County, Jilin Province, many farmers who had always worked independently voluntarily sought partners to organize mutual aid teams. In Zhangshan Village, the fourteenth district of this county, no one had ever collected manure, and there was not a single toilet in the whole village, and manure and urine were lost. Now they have automatically built toilets. After the Zhaoyuan experience was promoted at the county labor model conference, farmers' confidence in increasing production has greatly increased, and they feel that there is a future in the countryside.
    After the leading ideology was clarified, how can the work of promoting the new cultivation method be carried out? After extensive discussions at the meeting, it was unanimously agreed that the general working style must be changed, the mass line method must be adopted, the masses must be penetrated, and farmers must be educated using detailed and specific methods such as counting plant mouths and weighing ear heads. This is the first crucial step in making farmers believe that land has the potential to increase production. Comrades from Longjiang County, Heilongjiang Province, used two different stages of promotion work to illustrate this issue. They began to deploy the promotion of the Zhaoyuan experience work last October, and they talked about it at every meeting; but because it was just a general call, they did not take action for more than two months. After November, the leading cadres changed their working style and used concrete examples, first using the method of checking stubble, weighing ear heads, calculating plant mouths, and calculating detailed accounts to educate district and village cadres; after the district and village cadres understood and learned this method, they also used the same method to educate farmers. As a result, this work was carried out throughout the county. By the end of last December, 40,000 people in the county had studied the Zhaoyuan cultivation method, and it had greatly promoted winter work. Comrades from Yongji and Jiutai in Jilin Province, Acheng in Songjiang Province, and Liaoyuan and Dongfeng in Liaodong Province also unanimously introduced this experience in their speeches and affirmed this practice.
    However, at present, some areas lack a correct understanding of the Zhaoyuan experience, and many areas have only made general appeals, and only a few counties have really taken action. Doubting whether the Zhaoyuan experience can be promoted in this area is the main ideological obstacle at present. This is because they have neither studied the Zhaoyuan experience nor seriously investigated and summarized the local high-yield experience. In addition, some people believe that the Zhaoyuan cultivation method is an experience based on the old cultivation; in the future, a large number of new agricultural tools will be promoted, and promoting the Zhaoyuan experience is a retrogression. This idea is a one-sided view that opposes the promotion of the Zhaoyuan experience to the promotion of science and technology. They did not realize that the Zhaoyuan experience has solved the key problem of increasing agricultural production in Northeast China, and it is of great significance for the current universal increase in production (the area currently using new agricultural tools is still very small); and promoting the Zhaoyuan experience is also laying the foundation for the future promotion of new technologies and the use of animal-drawn farm implements. In addition, some people have a blind complacency, believing that the Zhaoyuan experience is nothing, and this area also has it, so there is no need to promote Zhaoyuan's. They did not realize that Zhaoyuan has made a systematic summary of the farmers' high-yield experience, and has a year of practical experience. Learning from the Zhaoyuan high-yield experience can avoid detours. Of course, the Zhaoyuan experience is not perfect, and all regions must combine it with local experience and supplement it in the process of promotion.
    Comrade Lin Feng made a concluding speech at the forum. He pointed out that all regions should thoroughly implement the spirit of the Northeast Bureau's Rural Work Conference, and called on all regions to do or basically do the main preparatory work for this year's agricultural production in February. Because there will be other important work to do after March, if too much important work is squeezed together, it will not be done well, and affecting production preparation will affect a year's production. Therefore, rural party rectification must be well combined with production preparation work. He criticized various erroneous ideas about promoting the Zhaoyuan experience, and emphasized that the essence of the Zhaoyuan experience should be learned. He said: "In particular, the working methods and leadership style of the Zhaoyuan County Party Committee are worth learning from. They went deep into the masses, learned from the masses, summarized the experience of the masses, and then promoted it, implementing Chairman Mao's instructions of 'from the masses, to the masses' and 'concentrate and adhere to it'. If this issue is clarified, there will be development in the promotion, and it will not be mechanically transported." He called on all rural work cadres to become experts in leading agricultural production, earnestly study, specifically lead, and work with the vast number of farmers to strive to complete this year's production increase task.

### 东北党、政农村工作部门开会决定  普遍推行肇源县丰产经验

    东北党、政农村工作部门开会决定
    普遍推行肇源县丰产经验
    【本报讯】中共中央东北局农村工作部、原东北人民政府农业部，一月十六日至十八日联合邀集中共各省省委农村工作部、东北各省人民政府农业厅的工作同志和部分县委、县政府负责同志举行座谈会，专门研究了推行肇源县丰产经验问题。会上除汇报情况外，着重讨论了肇源丰产经验在黑龙江省以外的地区能否推行、怎样开展推广工作等问题。许多县的同志介绍了这方面的典型经验，并且批判和检讨了对肇源经验的错误认识。会议期中，中共中央东北局第一副书记林枫同志做了重要指示。
    东北各地事实说明了，肇源丰产经验对全东北各地都是适用的，问题在于领导干部特别是县领导干部是不是领会了肇源丰产经验的实质，学习和研究了肇源县的耕作技术，并认真地总结本地的丰产经验，把它和肇源经验结合起来。
    许多县的同志在会上用充分的事实说明了这一点。松江省阿城县领导方面在开始时对肇源丰产经验能不能在本地推行意见是不一致的，有的认为完全可以推行，有的认为土质不同根本不能推行，有的认为可试试看；但这三种看法都没有充分根据。为了解决这个问题，他们就从调查、总结本地丰产经验入手。在调查、总结以后，发现凡是获得丰产的组、户，都是实行了宽播、间苗、保苗的，和肇源经验基本一致。这证实肇源经验完全可以在阿城推行。吉林省的永吉、九台，辽东省的东丰、辽源（西安）等县，也是采用同样的方法，得到了同样的结论。而且农民中早已有许多农谚叙说增产减产的原因，和肇源的经验相吻合。中共热河省委农村工作部的同志认为肇源县的丰产技术经验在热河省也完全需要推行。热河省和黑龙江省自然条件相差极大，而且一向认为耕作已比较细致；但是，根据调查，热河省一般作物都还缺苗百分之二十。去年许多获得高额产量的组、社，都是因为改进了栽培技术，苗全、苗好。例如每亩（东北亩，合一·五市亩）产八百四十一斤的黄元龄农业生产合作社的棉花，也还是缺苗的，每亩只有五千六百八十棵；如果能够每亩达到八千棵，完全有可能得到千斤以上的产量。
    许多县的同志用具体生动的事实说明肇源丰产经验被农民接受了以后对目前农村工作的巨大影响。实行肇源耕作法必须有相适应的组织形式。因之，肇源耕作法的推广，促进了互助合作运动的发展。春节还未到，许多农民都自动要求整顿、提高互助组，这在东北是历来没有的事。据松江省八个县的统计，已有九千个互助组（占八县互助组总数的百分之三十以上）进行整顿，扩大了范围，健全了各种制度，并订立了实行肇源耕作法的丰产计划，积极进行冬季副业生产和今年生产的物质准备。吉林省永吉县有许多从来都是单干的农民，自动找对象组织互助组。这个县第十四区张山村从来没人拾粪，全村没有一个厕所，粪、尿都流失了。现在已自动修起了厕所。在县劳动模范大会上宣传了肇源经验后，农民增产信心倍增，感到在农村有了奔头。
    在领导思想明确以后，怎样才能把推行新耕作法的工作开展起来呢？会上做了广泛的讨论以后，一致认为：肇源县委去年一年的工作经验和许多县份的事实都证明了，必须转变一般化的工作作风，采取群众路线的方法，深入群众，用数弓口、秤穗头等细致具体的方法教育农民。这是使农民相信土地有增产可能性的首要一环。黑龙江省龙江县的同志用推广工作的两个不同阶段说明了这个问题。他们去年十月就开始布置推行肇源经验工作，每次会议必讲；但因为只是一般号召，两个多月始终未行动起来。十一月以后，领导干部转变了作风，用具体的实例，首先用查槎子、秤穗头、算弓口、算细账的方法教育区村干部；区村干部领会了并学会了这一方法后，也运用同样方法教育农民。结果，这一工作便在全县开展起来了。到去年十二月底，全县已经有四万人学习了肇源耕作法，而且大大地推动了冬季工作。吉林省的永吉、九台，松江省的阿城，辽东省的辽源、东丰等县的同志，在发言中也都一致介绍了这项经验，肯定了这种作法。
    但是，目前有些地区对于肇源经验还缺乏正确的认识，有不少地区只做了一般号召，真正行动起来的还是少数县份。怀疑肇源经验是否可在本地区推行，是目前的主要思想障碍。这是因为既未学习肇源经验，也未认真调查、总结本地丰产经验。除此之外，还有些人认为肇源耕作法是在旧耕作基础上的经验；将来要大量推广新农具，推行肇源经验是开倒车。这种思想是把推行肇源经验和推广科学技术对立起来的片面观点。他们没有认识肇源经验解决了目前东北农业增产的关键问题，对当前普遍增产有重要意义（目前使用新农具的面积还很小）；而且推行肇源经验也正是给今后推行新技术、使用马拉农具打下基础。另外还有些人有一种盲目自满情绪，认为肇源经验没有什么，本地区也有，不必推行肇源的。他们没有认识到肇源已把农民的丰产经验作了系统的总结，并且有一年实践的经验，学习肇源丰产经验可以少走弯路。自然，肇源经验也并不是圆满无缺的，各地在推行中必须和本地经验相结合，加以补充。
    林枫同志在座谈会上做了总结讲话。他指出各地要很好贯彻东北局农村工作会议的精神，号召各地必须在二月份把今年农业生产的主要准备工作做好，或基本上做好。因为三月以后又有别的重要工作要做，重要工作挤多了便做不好，影响了生产准备就要影响一年的生产。因此农村整党必须和生产准备工作很好地结合起来。他批判了对推广肇源经验的各种错误思想，强调指出要学习肇源经验的实质。他说：“特别是肇源县委的工作方法和领导作风，值得大家学习。他们深入群众，向群众学习，把群众的经验总结起来，然后推广下去，执行了毛主席‘从群众中来到群众中去’‘集中起来坚持下去’的指示。这个问题弄通了，推广中就能有发展，而不致于机械搬运。”他号召所有农村工作干部要成为领导农业生产的内行，认真钻研，具体领导，和广大农民在一起，努力完成今年的增产任务。
