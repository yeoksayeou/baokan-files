Xinhua News Agency, Prague, February 12th: A report in the London "Daily Worker" on February 7th stated that British Labour groups, trade unions, dockworkers and workers in other sectors continue to protest Eisenhower's policy of expanding the war.

	The Southwark branch of the Electrical Trades Union has called on the Labour Party to urge all its affiliated groups to protest to the US Embassy against Eisenhower's actions.

	The Hayes branch of the Electrical Trades Union has demanded that "the British government not participate in any adventure of the American madmen."

	The Tottenham Trades Council has issued a petition calling on the government to make it clear to the Americans that Britain will never fight against China under any circumstances.

	Electrical workers at the St. Pancras tobacco factory in London telegraphed Foreign Secretary Eden, expressing surprise at this American action which "seriously endangers world peace." They also telegraphed the Trades Union Congress, urging it to "protest to the government on behalf of the British working people."

	The South London District Committee of the Amalgamated Engineering Union declared: "Under no circumstances will our people participate in expanding the war."

	The 15th branch of the London East District of the National Amalgamated Furnishing Trades Association, representing four thousand workers, expressed dissatisfaction with Eisenhower's actions.

	The Manchester District Branch of the Amalgamated Society of Woodworkers and the Enfield Branch of the Anglo-Chinese Friendship Association have also lodged similar protests.

	A delegation of 50,000 dockworkers from London, Liverpool and Manchester went to the House of Commons on February 6 to present their views to the members of Parliament. They pointed out that the unemployment of the dockworkers is inseparable from the US efforts to wage war against China. They said that allowing Chiang Kai-shek's pirates to operate freely would bring the current limited trade with China to a standstill.

    英国工人继续抗议艾森豪威尔扩大战争政策
    【新华社布拉格十二日电】二月七日伦敦“工人日报”消息：英国工党团体、工会、码头工人及其他部门的工人群众继续抗议艾森豪威尔扩大战争的政策。
    电气工会的南港分会要求工党敦促它所属的一切团体，向美国大使馆抗议艾森豪威尔的举动。
    电气工会海伊斯分会要求“英国政府不参与美国疯子的任何冒险”。
    托顿哈姆工会理事会发出了请愿书，要求政府明白告诉美国人，不论在什么情况下，英国绝不对中国作战。
    伦敦圣潘克拉斯纸烟工厂的电气工人致电外交大臣艾登，对于美国这种“严重地危害世界和平”的行动表示惊讶。他们并致电职工大会，促请它“代表英国劳动人民向政府提出抗议”。
    混合机器工会伦敦南区委员会宣布说：“不论在什么情况下，我国人民绝不参与扩大战争。”
    全国家具业职工联盟伦敦东区第十五分会代表四千工人，对艾森豪威尔的行动表示不满。
    木工联合会曼彻斯特区分会和英中友好协会恩菲尔德分会也都提出了同样的抗议。
    伦敦、利物浦和曼彻斯特五万码头工人的代表团于二月六日到下议院向议员们陈述意见。他们指出：码头工人群众的失业和美国极力想对中国作战的行动是分不开的。他们说，如果容许蒋介石的海盗自由行动的话，将使目前对中国的有限的贸易陷于停顿。
