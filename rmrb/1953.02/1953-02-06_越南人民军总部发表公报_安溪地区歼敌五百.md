Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, February 5th: Vietnam News Agency reported on the 3rd: The General Headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army issued a communiqué stating: The People's Army troops recently achieved new victories on the An Khe front. After removing the French military strongholds of Ju An and Xiu Shui and intercepting a French reinforcement battalion near Ju An, the People's Army also removed the French military stronghold of Meng Gu, east of An Khe, on January 21st.

The French army was forced to transfer artillery and paratrooper units from North and South Vietnam for reinforcements. On January 24th, the People's Army intercepted a French paratrooper battalion on Highway 19 between Kon Tum and An Khe, wiping out one of its companies and routing another two companies.

According to incomplete statistics, the People's Army, in twelve days of fighting on the An Khe front, killed and captured more than 500 enemy soldiers. The People's Army seized seven artillery pieces and mortars, more than 134 automatic rifles, more than 300 rifles, four armored vehicles, and a large amount of military supplies.

The communiqué pointed out: The victory in An Khe is proof of the great progress made by the People's Army in central and southern Vietnam in attacking enemy strongholds and intercepting enemy reinforcements. At the same time, it forces the enemy to transfer reinforcements from other fronts to fight the People's Army, further dispersing the enemy's main force and placing them in a more passive and embarrassing position.

    越南人民军总部发表公报
    安溪地区歼敌五百
    【新华社五日讯】越南通讯社三日讯：越南人民军总司令部发表公报说：人民军部队最近在安溪战线获得了新的胜利。在拔除居安、修水两个法军据点和在居安附近截击法国援军的一个营以后，人民军在一月二十一日又拔除了安溪以东的法军据点蒙谷。
    法军被迫从北越和南越抽调炮兵和伞兵部队前往增援。一月二十四日，人民军在崑嵩——安溪的第十九号公路上截击法军的一个伞兵营，歼灭它的一个连，击溃另外两个连。
    据不完全的统计，人民军在安溪战线作战十二天，打死和俘掳了敌军五百名以上。人民军缴获大炮迫击炮七门、自动步枪一百三十四支、步枪三百支以上、装甲车四辆和大量军事物资。
    公报指出：安溪的胜利是中越南部人民军在进攻敌人的坚固据点和截击敌人的增援部队方面有很大进步的证明。同时，它迫使敌人从其他各战线抽调援军来和人民军作战，使敌人的主力更加分散，并陷于更加被动和窘迫的地位。
