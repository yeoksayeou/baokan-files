Xinhua News Agency, January 31st: The United States is intensifying the rebuilding of Japan's aggressive armed forces.

The embryo of the notorious Japanese military establishment is being reformed in the form of the so-called "National Safety Agency," established in August 1952. In order to accelerate the rebuilding of this new Japanese military establishment, the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries have drastically increased the "National Safety Agency's" budget. In the 1952 fiscal year, it was more than 59.1 billion yen, while in the 1953 fiscal year, the allocated budget for the "National Safety Agency" has increased to 83 billion yen.

Currently, the main force of the "National Safety Agency" is the "National Safety Force," reorganized from the "Police Reserve Force." It has 110,000 personnel, organized into five divisions - four "regional units" and one "area unit." Due to concerns about opposition from the Japanese people and the difficulty of recruiting soldiers, the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries have not yet been able to realize their plan to increase the "National Safety Force" to 180,000 or even 300,000 personnel. They are currently concentrating on strengthening the "National Safety Force," especially the newly established "area unit." This "area unit" has established a tank battalion, a howitzer battalion, a heavy mortar battalion, and a machine gun battalion, and is equipped with anti-aircraft guns. American weapons are constantly being shipped to Japan. According to "U.S. News & World Report," the United States recently handed over 200 tanks and 210 howitzers to Japan, and plans to give Japan another 200 tanks and 150 artillery pieces.

The naval force under the "National Safety Agency" is the so-called "Maritime Safety Force," which currently has more than 7,500 personnel and 88 ships.

According to the "U.S.-Japan Ship Lease Agreement," the United States has begun to transfer its 18 escort frigates and 50 landing craft to Japan in batches, which are expected to be completed in April. In order to operate these ships, the "Maritime Safety Force" plans to increase its personnel by 3,000. The "Maritime Safety Force" plans to use this strength to first establish a joint fleet composed of three fleets. Not only that, according to the "Asahi Shimbun," the Yoshida government is negotiating with the United States to lease several 4,000-ton destroyers from the United States again in 1953. At the same time, the Yoshida government is also preparing to allocate 13 billion yen to build ships for the "Maritime Safety Force."

The work of rebuilding the air force is receiving more and more attention from the Yoshida government. Kimure Tokutaro, the director of the "National Safety Agency," recently stated publicly in Osaka that rebuilding the air force is the "focus of Japan's future national defense." In the 1953 fiscal year, the "National Safety Agency" will use 2.3 billion yen to purchase 100 light aircraft and 24 helicopters from foreign countries. At the same time, Japan's aircraft industry is also reviving under the support of the United States. In addition to contracting the repair of U.S. Air Force aircraft, it has begun to manufacture aircraft. Recently, the Japanese aircraft manufacturing industry is petitioning the government, requesting to undertake the construction of the 100 light aircraft that the "National Safety Agency" plans to order from foreign countries.

At the same time as accelerating the rebuilding of Japan's aggressive armed forces, the militarist spirit of militarism is being openly advocated by the Japanese authorities. Kimura Tokutaro openly preached that "restoring the moral code implemented before the war in accordance with the edict issued by Emperor Meiji to seek the guiding spirit for the new Japanese army" is "appropriate." It is obvious that the Japanese militarist remnants under the patronage of the United States are thinking about making a comeback and once again harming the Far East.

### 美国指使日本军国主义分子  加紧重建日本侵略军

    美国指使日本军国主义分子
    加紧重建日本侵略军
    【新华社三十一日讯】美国正在加紧重建日本的侵略军队。
    恶名昭彰的日本军部的胚胎已在重新形成，这就是一九五二年八月间成立的所谓“保安厅”。美、日反动派为了加速重建这一日本的新军部，已将“保安厅”的经费急剧增加。在一九五二会计年度是五百九十一亿多日元，而在一九五三会计年度中决定拨给“保安厅”的经费已增加到八百三十亿日元。
    目前“保安厅”的主要部队是由“警察后备队”改编的“保安队”。它拥有十一万人，编为五个师——四个“管区队”和一个“方面队”。由于顾虑日本人民的反对和征募兵员的困难，美、日反动派现在还没有能够实现它们的将“保安队”增加到十八万人以至三十万人的计划。它们目前正在集中力量充实“保安队”，特别是其中新成立的“方面队”的装备，这一“方面队”已经建立了坦克营、榴弹炮营、重迫击炮营和机关枪营，并配备有高射炮。美国武器还在源源运到日本。据“美国新闻与世界报道”说，美国最近已交给日本二百辆坦克和二百十门榴弹炮，并打算再给日本二百辆坦克和一百五十门大炮。
    “保安厅”属下的海军部队就是所谓“海上警备队”，它目前拥有兵员七千五百多人和八十八艘舰艇。
    根据“美、日船舶租借协定”，美国已开始分批将它的十八艘护航快舰和五十艘登陆艇移交给日本，预料将在四月间移交完毕。为了运用这些舰艇，“海上警备队”计划增加兵额三千人。“海上警备队”准备以这样的实力首先成立一个由三支舰队组成的联合舰队。不仅如此，据“朝日新闻”透露：吉田政府正在与美国进行谈判，准备在一九五三年再向美国租借若干艘四千吨级的驱逐舰。同时，吉田政府也准备拨款一百三十亿日元为“海上警备队”建造舰艇。
    对于重建空军的工作，愈来愈受到吉田政府的重视。“保安厅”长官木村笃太郎最近在大阪公开表示，重建空军是日本“今后国防的重心”。“保安厅”在一九五三会计年度中将以二十三亿日元向外国购置一百架轻型飞机和二十四架直升飞机。同时，日本的飞机工业也在美国的扶植下复活中。它除了承包修理美国空军飞机的工程以外，已在开始制造飞机。最近日本的飞机制造业正在向政府请愿，要求承造“保安厅”准备向外国订购的一百架轻型飞机。
    和加速重建日本侵略武装的同时，军国主义黩武精神正在为日本当局公开倡导。木村笃太郎就公然鼓吹说：“恢复战前按照明治天皇发布的诏令的路线而实施的道德法规，以为新的日本军队寻求主导的精神”是“适当的”。事情很明显，在美国扶植下的日本军国主义残余分子所念念不忘的正是东山再起，重新为祸远东。
