Comrades:
　　At the First National Organizational Work Conference of the Party held the year before last, Comrade Liu Shaoqi made an assessment of the overall situation of our Party, stating: "Our Party is great, glorious, and correct; it is unprecedented in Chinese history." This assessment is entirely correct. For thirty-one years, under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, our Party led the people of the whole country in a vigorous Great Revolution, overthrowing the reactionary rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism, achieving a great victory, and gaining rich and mature experience in struggle, cultivating a large number of excellent cadres, and winning the sincere support of the people of the whole country. This shows that the positive and healthy factors within our Party are fundamental, primary, and dominant.
　　However, problems still exist within our Party, and rather serious negative and unhealthy phenomena still exist in the life of our Party organizations. Although this is not the main aspect of our Party's situation, these problems must attract our serious attention. In the past, we did not expose this aspect sufficiently. In the past year, the great "Three-Anti" Movement and the Party Rectification Movement have revealed a large number of negative and unhealthy phenomena existing within our Party, making our understanding of these problems much more profound than in the past. Recently, in Comrade Malenkov's report at the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, a sharp and profound criticism was made of some negative and unhealthy phenomena existing within the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. This report is of great help to us. In our Party, not only do the problems pointed out by Comrade Malenkov exist, but they are even more widespread and serious than those he pointed out. Therefore, I believe that we should use Comrade Malenkov's report as a weapon to seriously analyze these serious problems existing within our Party, mobilize the whole Party, and launch a resolute and tenacious struggle against these phenomena in the Bolshevik spirit.
　　What are the negative and unhealthy phenomena existing in the life of our Party organizations?
　　First, criticism and self-criticism, especially bottom-up criticism, have not been fully developed, and the phenomenon of suppressing criticism is still quite widespread and serious.
　　Generally speaking, our Party has always attached importance to criticism and self-criticism. Comrade Mao Zedong, in many of his instructions, has repeatedly emphasized the importance of this issue. In the practice of our Party life, we have indeed paid attention to this issue. The successive rectification movements, Party rectification movements, and the "Three-Anti" Movement in the previous period were all large-scale and in-depth movements of criticism and self-criticism. Each such movement has played an important role in raising the awareness of the entire Party and every Party member. This achievement must be affirmed. However, in the life of our Party, shortcomings still exist in the issue of criticism and self-criticism. That is, criticism and self-criticism are not regular enough, especially the lack of regular bottom-up criticism. Therefore, after the movement is over, many shortcomings and errors that have been severely attacked in the movement "resurface" and re-emerge, even developing to a more serious extent. Some people secretly rejoice by grasping this kind of pattern of ours. Whenever a certain movement comes, they make preparations in many ways and pretend to be very active and sincere, as if they are truly engaged in a relentless struggle against all erroneous tendencies. They can even tearfully confess at the meeting, admitting all their mistakes. However, when the movement is over and everything is "calm," they return to their old ways, throwing their self-criticism aside and doing whatever they want. Obviously, without regular criticism, especially bottom-up criticism, and without the supervision of the masses, we cannot fight against such people. Without regular criticism, especially bottom-up criticism, and without the supervision of the masses, even good communists may become bad.
　　Within our Party, many people are very unaccustomed to criticism from below, from the masses. Many people have such a wrong idea: they can accept criticism from superiors, but not from subordinates; they can accept criticism from the Party, but not from the masses. These people believe that they should only be responsible to their superiors, and can be irresponsible to their subordinates and the masses; they believe that their work should not be subject to the supervision of the masses, and therefore, they can ignore the opinions of the masses.
　　It should be pointed out that the phenomenon of adopting a bureaucratic attitude of ignoring the opinions and criticisms of the masses is not isolated or a minority, but is quite widespread and serious. There are many such examples. We will only cite the extremely bad attitude taken by certain leading organs towards letters from the masses to illustrate this problem. The Shandong Provincial People's Government has accumulated more than 70,000 letters from the masses, and ordinary counties have accumulated more than 300 letters. Chang'an County, Shaanxi Province, has accumulated more than 1,100 letters from the masses. In Fuzhou City, according to the results of inspections by only seventeen departments, more than 3,285 letters from the masses have been accumulated. The 110 letters from the masses accumulated in the Xindian District of the city have been accumulated by three district chiefs over a long period of time. According to incomplete statistics from thirty-one organs in Shanghai, more than 22,000 letters from the masses have been accumulated. Many complaint boxes are filled with letters from the masses, and because they have not been opened for years, they are exposed to the sun and rain, and many are illegible. This is a serious phenomenon that cannot be tolerated.
　　Adopting an attitude of ignoring criticism from below, from the masses, is a manifestation of suppressing criticism. Another, and more serious, manifestation of suppressing criticism is persecuting and retaliating against critics. These behaviors exist extensively among district and village cadres, and their behaviors are often carried out with the support of their superiors. For example, the intolerable attitude of the Teng County Party Committee of Shandong Province in handling the serious criminal behavior of the cadres of Zhao Wangtang Village in Jining County is representative of many similar phenomena. The cadres and militiamen of Zhao Wangtang Village, led by Wang Shukun and Wang Shushen, have committed numerous crimes, and the masses hate them to the bone, saying they are "more vicious than the Japanese invaders." However, the Teng County Party Committee believed that Wang Shukun and others "had made contributions in the past," and that doing these bad things was not the responsibility of the village cadres, but the conspiracy of the landlords, and even arrested Sun Huaitang and his son and others who reflected the criminal facts of Wang Shukun and others. Even when the Shandong Branch issued a telephone notice to release these three people, it still refused to comply. It was not until the branch repeatedly criticized them that they were gradually forced to correct this error. It can be seen from this incident that since the Teng County Party Committee takes such an attitude towards the opinions of the masses, it is only natural that such serious problems as Zhao Wangtang Village have not been resolved for a long time. What is even more noteworthy is that this kind of behavior of persecuting and retaliating against critics also exists among some intermediate and even senior cadres. The "Ji Kaifu Incident" in Wuhan City, which we dealt with in the early stage of the "Three-Anti" Movement, is a typical example. In addition, we can cite many such things. The recent incident of Huang Yifeng, Minister of Communications of East China, retaliating against critics is also one of them. The above-mentioned are only a part of the phenomena of retaliating and attacking critics, which is a relatively open and crude part. Some people (including some senior cadres) also retaliate against critics, and even persecute them, but they are unwilling to take this open and crude method of retaliation. What they take is another—a hidden method. That is, when a cadre criticizes him, he thinks of various ways and finds various excuses to "fix" this cadre, and can find many reasons at work and move many "principles" to cover up his retaliatory behavior, so that the person he "fixes" knows that he is suffering retaliation, but cannot speak out. Some honest and selfless cadres are often hit because of this, so that in the end, they are squeezed out of a place. I think we must no longer tolerate this extremely damaging phenomenon to the interests of the Party. It should be pointed out that this is also an illegal act, and everyone who loves the cause of the Party should launch a ruthless struggle against this behavior. Comrade Malenkov said: "The view that bottom-up criticism can unfold automatically in a free-flowing manner is wrong. Only when everyone who raises healthy criticism can be sure that he can get the support of our organization, and can be sure that the shortcomings he pointed out will be truly eliminated, can bottom-up criticism unfold and expand." These words are very profound for us. Obviously, when a person wants to expose and criticize a certain bad phenomenon, knowing that what he will get is not support, but retaliation and persecution, his confidence and courage will certainly be reduced. If we cannot prove with practical actions that we resolutely support critics, even if we issue many calls, it will not have any effect.
　　Therefore, we must "treat those who hinder the development of criticism of our shortcomings, suppress criticism, and persecute and retaliate against critics as deadly enemies of the Party, and wage a ruthless struggle against them" (Malenkov). It should be clearly pointed out that the act of suppressing criticism and persecuting and retaliating against critics is a violation of Party discipline and an illegal act. For Party members who have committed this kind of error, no matter how senior the cadres are, they must be given strict Party disciplinary sanctions, even to the point of expulsion from the Party. These incidents and the Party's decision on punishment should be publicly announced in the newspapers to educate the vast number of Party members and the people.
　　Regularly protecting the criticism of the masses and promoting the spirit of the masses to dare to put forward criticism are necessary conditions for promoting the progress of our Party and the prosperity of the country. Comrade Stalin told us: "Of course, we cannot demand that criticism be 100% correct. If the criticism comes from the bottom up, then even if the criticism is only 5%-10% correct, we should not despise it." In fact, if we demand that every criticism of the masses be 100% correct, it would be tantamount to strangling the criticism of the masses. Comrade Stalin said: "...As long as you try to put forward this requirement, you will block the mouths of thousands and tens of thousands of workers and worker correspondents who are willing to correct our shortcomings but sometimes are not good at expressing their meaning correctly. This is a dead end, not self-criticism." He also said: "If you require their criticism to be 100% correct, then you will eliminate any possibility of criticism from below, any possibility of self-criticism." But it is necessary to know that many of the criticisms of the masses are correct; even if some are not completely correct or incorrect, we must pay attention to them. This is the principle that Comrade Mao Zedong often tells us: "The speaker is not guilty, and the listener should be warned." Failure to abide by such a principle in dealing with the criticisms of the masses is a crime against the Party.
　　Second, the phenomenon of lack of organization and discipline is still very serious, especially the phenomenon of not reflecting the shortcomings in work and "reporting good news but not bad news" is very serious.
　　Since the Party Central Committee issued the instructions on strengthening the system of requests for instructions and reports and opposing anarchism and lack of discipline in 1948, great achievements have been made, and the degree of organization, discipline, and unified concentration has been greatly improved throughout the Party. Therefore, it guaranteed the victory of the national liberation war and the victory of various social reforms and economic recovery work since the national liberation. However, it must be pointed out that, up to now, the phenomenon of lack of organization and discipline has not been completely overcome, and many phenomena of lack of organization and discipline are still constantly occurring.
　　Particularly serious, and also the most harmful to the Party, is the phenomenon of only reflecting the achievements of work to superiors, but not talking about the shortcomings in work, "reporting good news but not bad news," and "concealing evils and promoting good." In many places and many departments, problems exist in the work, even serious problems, but they rarely report to superiors. Since some leading organs do not do enough systematic inspection of work, some people take advantage of this weakness to exaggerate the achievements of their work, and try to cover up the shortcomings as much as possible. Sometimes they also talk about some shortcomings, but only lightly. Therefore, the reported situation often differs greatly from the actual situation. Even when some problems have been discovered by superiors and they are asked about them, they are unwilling to present the true situation in full, but only report a part that has to be said, and try to cover up what can be covered up. What is particularly dangerous is that the leading comrades of certain Party committees and certain departments have become accustomed to such serious violations of Party discipline and do not feel that there is anything wrong with doing so.
　　This phenomenon of "reporting good news but not bad news" can be divided into two types: (1) Due to bureaucratic work style, they do not investigate, do not study, and do not understand the real situation. They report to superiors whatever the subordinates report. (2) Knowing that there are shortcomings and problems in the work, they intentionally conceal them, fearing that superiors will find that their work is not done well, which will be detrimental to themselves; if someone reports these shortcomings and problems to superiors, they try to cover up and shirk responsibility as much as possible.
　　Both of these phenomena are extremely wrong and intolerable. The latter is even worse than the former. Those who cover up the shortcomings of work are not concerned about the interests of the people. What they are concerned about is their own "reputation," "prestige," and the "impression" of their superiors on themselves. Therefore, when serious shortcomings or errors occur in the work, they do not try to find out the truth, let alone seriously correct them. But when others reflect that there are problems or errors in their work, they immediately investigate: "Who reflected it?" They can spend a lot of effort to investigate who said bad things about him to his superiors, and then treat the person who reflected the true situation as an enemy. A further development of this error is writing false reports. Those who write false reports do not write reports based on the actual situation of the work. The purpose of their writing reports is to deceive the trust of their superiors. Therefore, they have many things in their pockets, and they have whatever they want. Whatever the superiors like, they take out.
　　Of course, some "false reports" are not completely unfounded. Some people know that fabricating false reports that are completely unfounded is too dangerous. Therefore, they always find a little "basis," or even reluctantly create a few "typical examples," and then promote and expand them. But they themselves know very well that these "typical examples" and these "bases" cannot represent the true situation of the work. The reason why they do this is just to prepare to find some reasons to prevaricate when their false reports are exposed.
　　We must never condone and tolerate this serious violation of Party discipline, the corruption and disintegration of the Party's combat effectiveness, and the destruction of the Party's unified concentration. "The Party requires all Party members, especially leading cadres, to be loyal and honest, and to conscientiously fulfill their responsibilities to the Party and the country. The Party cannot trust those who harm the interests of the country in action, attempt to play tricks on the government, and deceive the Party and the country. Any behavior that deceives the Party and the country, no matter what method is adopted, and any attempt to deceive, whether it is concealing the truth or distorting the truth, can only be regarded as an extremely serious crime against the Party." (Malenkov) Some leading cadres also say in words that they should be loyal and honest to the Party, but their actual actions are another matter. The Party must treat such people with severe measures. If they cannot sincerely admit their mistakes and truly correct these mistakes, the Party should remove them from their leading positions and give them the punishment they deserve, even to the point of expulsion from the Party.
　　In the past, we were too accommodating and "caring" to some cadres who made mistakes. When a cadre made a mistake, they were often forgiven because this cadre "had made contributions to the revolution in the past." In this way, the seriousness of Party discipline was undermined. We must resolutely overcome this shortcoming. It should be emphasized that our Party has only one discipline, and both ordinary Party members and leading cadres are equally bound by it. Anyone who violates Party discipline should be subject to the punishment they deserve under the same principles. It is absolutely not allowed to have any accommodation and indulgence because of someone's qualifications and status. Absolutely no one is allowed to cover up the mistakes they have made now by pretending to have "made contributions in the past."
　　In the future, in addition to strictly implementing Party discipline, strengthening Party life and education for Party members, and strengthening top-down inspection of the implementation of Party policies and resolutions; we must also pay special attention to developing bottom-up criticism, fully promoting democracy, and placing the Party's organization and Party's work under the supervision of the vast number of Party members and the masses. To achieve this, we will inevitably encounter many difficulties, and only if we make great determination and resolutely lead the vast number of Party members and the masses to wage a tenacious struggle against various obstructing forces can we effectively overcome the above-mentioned various bad phenomena of lack of organization, lack of discipline, and violation of laws and regulations.
　　Third, there are serious weaknesses in our work of selecting cadres and understanding cadres, and there are tendencies of "qualification theory," "valuing talent over virtue," and "nepotism." The phenomenon of using bureaucratic and formalistic methods to look at cadres only from the surface and lacking in-depth investigation of cadres is extremely common.
　　First of all, there is the issue of the criteria for selecting cadres. There should be only one criterion for selecting cadres, that is, the criterion of "both virtue and talent" put forward by Comrade Mao Zedong, and there should not be any other criteria. "Virtue" is a cadre's political quality, and "talent" is a cadre's professional ability. The two aspects must be combined and cannot be neglected.
　　This criterion is originally very clear, but in many places and many departments, it is often not followed when selecting cadres. Many places and many departments still first determine a cadre's job position based on the cadre's qualifications and history. Therefore, some phenomena are created: a cadre has good political quality and professional ability, and is suitable for holding a certain position, but is not appointed to hold that position because he is not qualified enough; at the same time, another cadre has neither the political quality nor the professional ability as the former cadre, and is not very suitable for that position, but is reluctantly appointed to hold that position because he is old, and the work is of course lost. Obviously, in order to constantly push the Party's cause forward, we must break this wrong "qualification theory," boldly promote those outstanding young cadres who have "both virtue and talent," give them support and help, and enable them to competently take on their job positions; for those cadres who are qualified but progress very slowly, we should spur and urge them to continue to move forward; and for those who have a long history of struggle, although they have made some contributions to the revolutionary cause, but due to arrogance and complacency, do not seek progress, "eat their fill all day long, and have nothing to do," have lost their political sensitivity, and are therefore no longer suitable for the leading positions they hold, they should be removed from their existing leading positions and assigned to do another job that they can do well.
　　Another erroneous tendency in the work of selecting cadres is the idea of valuing talent over virtue. This erroneous idea is very serious among the leading cadres of many economic departments. For example, some leaders of economic departments believe that cadres with "both virtue and talent" do not actually exist, so they say: "When two cadres are together, one has talent and the other has virtue, and it's enough to put them together." Some said: "I am bold and dare to use people. Historical and political problems are things of the past, and they will not be counter-revolutionary now." Others said: "Those with virtue but no talent engage in Party-masses work, and those with talent but no virtue engage in administration." Some arbitrarily modify the Party's principles for selecting cadres, and some even put forward the erroneous principle of "three points for politics and seven points for business."
　　Due to the existence of such erroneous ideas, many people regard "technology" and "education level" as the only conditions for selecting cadres, and do not pay attention to investigating a cadre's political quality at all. Some leaders trust those old personnel who have not undergone serious ideological transformation and political investigation, and only think that they have technology and high education level, and mainly rely on these people to do their work, so that the work is not done well, erroneous ideas and styles are also developed, and even some bad elements occupy the leading positions of certain departments, causing serious losses in work. During the "Three-Anti" Movement, from the central government to various provinces and cities, many departments exposed serious phenomena of impure cadres. Although there are many reasons for this, the emphasis on business ability alone and the neglect of political quality are the most important reason among all the reasons.
　　This is certainly not to say that whether a cadre has a certain professional ability is irrelevant to the cause of the Party; on the contrary, we should attach great importance to the improvement of cadres' professional ability. Since the economic recovery period has ended ahead of schedule, and large-scale economic construction has begun, the vast number of cadres will gradually be fixed in professional work. Therefore, it is very important for the Party to seriously guide our cadres to study their professions and guide them to learn what they do not know or are not familiar with. If this is not done, all construction plans will become empty talk on paper. Experience in recent years has proved that learning a specialized skill is indeed not an easy task. One must have the spirit of "hanging one's head from the beam and stabbing one's thighs with an awl," and have the determination to overcome all difficulties in order to gradually learn it. Judging from the results of cadres studying their professions in recent years, there are three different situations: The first type of people have really worked hard, so they have drilled into it; the second type of people have worked a little, but it is not enough. They have drilled in a little, but it is very superficial; the third type of people have not worked hard, so they have not drilled in at all, and they are still completely ignorant. The first type of people should be encouraged and helped to continue to move forward; the second type of people should acknowledge their progress, but at the same time point out their shortcomings and urge them to catch up; the third type of people should be severely criticized, and if they still have not changed and progressed, they should be asked to give up their seats and replaced by other people who are willing to work hard to study, and they cannot be allowed to continue to delay the work.
　　However, after a cadre has "drilled into" a certain business, we must pay attention to preventing another tendency, that is, the tendency of "only asking about business, not asking about politics." The aforementioned tendency of "valuing talent over virtue" when selecting cadres is a manifestation of being out of touch with political tendencies. When these comrades have concentrated all their energy on a certain business, their attention to the general direction and political principles may gradually decrease. If they are not given attention in time, their vision will gradually become narrow and short-sighted. They will forget the overall situation, forget the general situation and tasks, and only see the part of the business they are engaged in. Therefore, their work may deviate from the Party's policies and guidelines and make political errors. Comrade Stalin taught us: "In any department of state work and Party work, the higher the political level and the degree of Marxist-Leninist consciousness of the staff, the higher the work itself, the more effective it is, and the more effective the results of the work; conversely, the lower the political level and the degree of Marxist-Leninist consciousness of the staff, the more delays and failures in the work, and the staff themselves will become more and more short-sighted petty people, degenerating into some people who only seek immediate interests, and they will be more likely to degenerate and change their minds—this should be regarded as a theorem." ("Problems of Leninism" Chinese edition of the Moscow Foreign Language Publishing House, page 782) The responsibility of the Party leadership lies in constantly reminding these comrades, sharply opposing all tendencies to get out of politics, and constantly improving their political level and the degree of Marxist-Leninist consciousness. Only in this way can we help these comrades truly do their business well.
　　There is another more dangerous phenomenon in the work of selecting cadres, that is, some leaders leave the Party's principles and quote their relatives, friends, and fellow villagers. There are many such things. Here, we only need to cite the fact that Tang Yunchao, the former Minister of Labor of Northeast China, introduced as many as forty-two landlords, capitalists, old policemen, traitors, and suspected special agents to the labor department. This has made many Party organizations and government agencies a harmonious group, lacking political atmosphere, unsound organizational life, unable to develop criticism and self-criticism, and even covering up each other. In such circumstances, some honest cadres with ideological ability are often excluded and attacked.
　　Secondly, our work of understanding cadres is not done well enough. The phenomenon of using bureaucratic and formalistic methods to understand cadres is extremely common. Many organizational departments only recognize a cadre based on a cadre's resume and archival materials, which is of course not enough. But the main shortcoming is that some leading organs only recognize a cadre based on the report a cadre makes to his superiors, based on the superficial achievements of a cadre's work—the number of completed tasks; instead of recognizing a cadre from direct contact with the cadre, from checking his work, from his method of completing tasks, the quality of work, and the actual results. Therefore, some bad cadres are considered good cadres by their superiors because they can make reports and show the achievements of their work—many of these achievements are exaggerated or obtained by violating policies and coercive orders; on the contrary, those cadres who are down-to-earth, bury themselves in work, and conscientiously implement the Party's policies may be considered by their superiors to be bad cadres and incapable cadres. Obviously, this is a very dangerous phenomenon.
　　In order to overcome this phenomenon, in addition to the leading organs of the Party at all levels having to gradually but resolutely adopt the method of directly contacting cadres and adopting the method of checking the actual work of cadres to understand cadres, we should also pay attention to understanding cadres from below and from the masses. Even if we have done some work to understand cadres in the past, we have learned more from above and rarely paid attention to the opinions of the masses at the lower level. However, without these opinions, our understanding of cadres is incomplete. The views of the leaders and the views of the masses both have certain limitations. Only when we know the views of both parties, and after research and analysis, combine the views of both parties can we get a complete understanding of a cadre.
　　Fourth, there are still quite serious bureaucratic and formalistic styles in many leading organs of the Party and the government. The phenomena of coercive orders and being out of touch with the masses that are common in the lower-level organizations of the Party and the government have not yet been overcome.
　　The "Three-Anti" Movement of last year achieved great success. In this movement, the problems of corruption and waste among many staff members at the four levels of the special zone, province and city, large administrative region, and central government were basically resolved, and the bureaucratic problem of many leaders and organs being separated from the masses was also basically resolved. But if we think that bureaucratism is no longer a serious problem in the leading organs of the Party and the government because of these achievements, it is not appropriate.
　　Facts have proved that the bureaucratic and formalistic style is quite serious in many leading organs of the Party and the government. The characteristics of this bureaucratism and formalism are: not understanding the real situation below, not understanding and not caring about the suffering of the masses, not proceeding from the objective actual conditions to consider and decide their work, but often proceeding from the untrue situation, not distinguishing the urgency and importance of the work, but only considering and deciding their work based on subjective wishes. Therefore, the work tasks put forward are often too many, too heavy, and too urgent, making the lower level very tense and busy, and "exhausted," and unable to do the work well. In addition, when arranging work, they simply emphasize the need to "complete the task," and do not clearly and specifically explain the policy boundaries to the lower level, and do not clearly and specifically explain the work style and methods; after arranging the work, they rarely check it, only satisfied with the superficial achievements of the work reported by the lower level, and do not pay attention to the actual effect of the work; only see the good aspects of the work, and do not see the bad aspects of the work; only pursue quantity, and do not pay attention to quality; in this way, it has promoted the "purely task-oriented" view and the coercive style of the lower-level organizations and lower-level cadres, turning many good things into bad things, causing losses to the interests of the people, and damaging the connection between the Party and the masses.
　　Some leading cadres, although verbally opposing the bureaucratic and formalistic style, are actually committing bureaucratic and formalistic errors. They do not go deep into the lower level, do not understand the situation, and do not check the work, so they are easily led to believe some "reporting good news but not bad news" reports, are easily deceived by some superficial achievements of the work, and are therefore easily generate a kind of blind optimism, thinking that the work is good, the achievements are great, and although there are shortcomings, they are not worth special attention. Therefore, they are lax, paralyzed, and careless, and do not know what serious problems have occurred below. Often some problems have developed very seriously below, and the leading organs do not know at all, or although they know some, they do not regard it as an important problem, resulting in the long-term existence and continued development of many phenomena that seriously damage the interests of the people.
　　Some leading cadres have high enthusiasm and good wishes. They are willing to do more good things for the masses, but because they are infected with a bureaucratic style, they do not pay attention to how to do these things well in a practical way, do not understand how to follow the mass line, and do not understand how to consult with the masses to do things. As a result, it is the opposite of their wishes, and the actual effect of the work is very bad. Instead of doing good things for the masses, they have increased the suffering of the masses. Obviously, for such leading cadres, the Party cannot forgive them because they have the wish to do good things for the masses. Because the Party does not judge whether a leading cadre has completed the task assigned to him by the Party based on his wishes, but judges whether he has completed the task assigned to him by the Party based on the actual results of the work of the region or department he leads. It should be pointed out that no matter how high their enthusiasm and how good their wishes are, as long as they have not removed the bureaucratic style from their bodies, the Party has the responsibility to seriously educate them, severely criticize them, and if they still cannot make up their minds to correct and continue to cause losses to the people, the Party should give them the punishment they deserve, and even remove them from their leading positions.
　　Closely related to the above-mentioned bureaucratism and formalism are the phenomena of coercive orders and being out of touch with the masses in the district and township organizations of the Party and the government and in some county organizations. This phenomenon is still extremely common and serious. In many places, there are also serious phenomena of coercive orders in agricultural production, patriotic health campaigns, and other work that directly benefits the masses. Under the control of this bad style, such work as organizing the masses to dig wells to fight drought, promoting good varieties, issuing agricultural loans, and giving vaccinations, which are closely linked to the current practical interests of the masses, will also cause great pain to the masses and make the masses complain. There are many such facts, which must be said to be a very serious problem.
　　In addition, in many places, the phenomena of district and township cadres and some county cadres violating laws and regulations, attacking criticism, protecting counter-revolutionaries, and framing good people are also extremely serious.
　　The existence of these phenomena seriously harms the interests of the people, distorts the Party's policies, and damages the connection between the Party and the masses. Obviously, this is an extremely bad anti-people style, which is absolutely incompatible with our Party's style. In terms of its social roots, this style is a reflection of the reactionary style of the reactionary ruling class dealing with the people (that is, the Kuomintang style) in our Party and the government. To fight against this bad style is not only a major issue at present, but will also be a major issue for a long period in the future.
　　The existence of this style is directly related to the impure composition and impure ideological style of many lower-level organizations and lower-level cadres.
　　This shows that we have not conducted reviews of cadres at all levels, especially cadres at the county, district, and township levels, or that the review work has not been done very well. This also shows that the Party rectification work at the county, district, and township levels has not achieved the due results, and has not carried out the struggle against commandism and the elimination of law-breaking and discipline-violating elements in the Party rectification. In addition, there is an important reason, which is what was mentioned earlier, that there is still serious bureaucratism in many leading organs of the Party and the government. Many higher-level leading organs do not understand the suffering of the people, do not understand that there are many commandism and law-breaking and discipline-violating bad people and bad things among the cadres at the county, district, and township levels, or although they have some understanding of these bad people and bad things, they turn a blind eye, do not arouse indignation, and do not feel the seriousness of the problem, and therefore do not take active measures to support good people, punish bad people, promote good things, and eliminate bad things, so that these serious phenomena can exist and develop. At the same time, many higher-level organs only ask lower-level organs for tasks and figures, but cannot clearly and specifically explain policies to lower-level organs, and draw a line between what should be done and what should not be done; cannot clearly and specifically teach lower-level organs how to carry out certain work; do not pay attention to checking work, and do not pay attention to mobilizing Party members and the masses to carry out bottom-up criticism, which further promotes the phenomena of commandism and being out of touch with the masses.
　　Therefore, we cannot regard the problems of coercive orders and being out of touch with the masses in the lower-level organizations of the Party and the government as only problems of these organizations themselves, but must link these problems with the bureaucratism and formalism in the leadership. And only by seriously correcting the bureaucratism and formalism of the leading organs can we further thoroughly correct these errors of the lower-level organizations of the Party and the government.
　　Comrades: I believe that the four problems mentioned above are the main negative and unhealthy phenomena that exist in the life of our Party organization. An important reason why these phenomena have existed in our Party organization for a long time is, as Comrade Malenkov said, that "the importance of ideological work has been underestimated." That is to say, "Party organs have weakened their attention to the Party's organizational work and ideological work, so in many organizations of the Party, this work has become unattended." The phenomenon of "the Party not managing the Party" that Comrade Mao Zedong spoke of in 1948 has not yet changed or has not changed much.
　　In order to further consolidate our Party, strengthen the connection between the Party and the people, eliminate the phenomenon of neglecting the Party's organizational work and ideological work, improve the Party's work level, and completely eliminate the negative and unhealthy phenomena existing in our Party organization, we must take some active and effective measures. The five tasks of consolidating the Party mentioned by Comrade Malenkov are also applicable to our Party. In order to be more

    为消除党组织内的消极的和不健康的现象而斗争
    ——一九五三年一月七日在中共中央直属机关干部学习会上的报告
    安子文同志们：
    在前年召开的党的第一次全国组织工作会议上，刘少奇同志曾对我们党的总的情况作了估计，就是：“我们的党是伟大的、光荣的和正确的；是中国历史上从来没有过的。”这个估计是完全正确的。我们党三十一年来，在毛泽东同志的领导下，率领全国人民进行了轰轰烈烈的大革命，打倒了帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的反动统治，得到了伟大的胜利，并取得了丰富的成熟的斗争经验，培养了大批优秀的干部，获得了全国人民的真诚支持。这就说明了：在我们党内积极的健康的因素，是基本的、主要的，占统治地位的。
    但是在我们党内还存在着问题，在我们党组织的生活中还存在着相当严重的消极的和不健康的现象。这虽然不是我们党的情况的主要方面，但是这一方面的问题必须引起我们严重的注意。我们过去对于这一方面，还揭发得很不够。近一年来，伟大的“三反”运动和整党运动，大量地揭露出我们党内所存在的消极的和不健康的现象，使我们对这方面问题的认识比之过去是深刻得多了。最近在苏联共产党第十九次代表大会上马林科夫同志的报告中，对苏联共产党内所存在的一些消极的和不健康的现象作了尖锐而深刻的批判，这个报告对我们有极大的帮助。在我们党内不仅同样存在着马林科夫同志所指出的那些问题，而且还比他所指出的更为普遍、严重。因此，我认为应该以马林科夫同志的报告为武器，对我们党内存在的这些严重问题加以认真分析，发动全党，用布尔什维克的精神对这些现象展开坚决、顽强的斗争。
    在我们党组织的生活中存在着那些消极的和不健康的现象呢？
    第一、批评与自我批评，特别是自下而上的批评，还没有充分展开，压制批评的现象还相当普遍、严重。
    一般来讲，我们党对批评和自我批评一向是重视的。毛泽东同志在他很多的指示中，曾一再地强调指出这个问题的重要性。在我们党的生活的实践中也确实曾经注意了这个问题，历次的整风、整党运动和前一时期的“三反”运动，都是大规模的深入的批评和自我批评运动，每一次这样的运动对全党和每个党员都起了重要的提高作用，这种成绩是必须加以肯定的。但是在我们党的生活中，在批评与自我批评的问题上还存在着缺点，这就是批评与自我批评的经常性不够，特别是缺乏经常的自下而上的批评，因而运动过去之后，很多在运动中已遭到痛击的缺点和错误，又“死灰复燃”，重新抬头，甚至在更严重的程度上发展起来。有些人就是以摸住我们这样一种规律而暗自得意。他们每当某一个运动来到的时候，就多方进行准备，并且装得很积极，很诚恳，好像真正是在和一切错误倾向进行无情斗争，甚至可以痛哭流涕地在大会上作检讨，承认自己的一切错误，但是当运动过去之后，一切已经“风平浪静”的时候，他们就又恢复了老样子，把自己的检讨扔到一边，想怎样做就怎样做。很显然，没有经常性的批评，特别是自下而上的批评，没有群众的监督，我们就无法和这样的人进行斗争。而没有经常性的批评，特别是自下而上的批评，没有群众的监督，即使好的共产党员也可能变坏的。
    在我们党内，很多人对于来自下边、来自群众的批评是很不习惯的。很多人有这样一种错误的思想：可以受上级的批评，但不能受下级的批评；可以受党的批评，但不能受群众的批评。这些人认为自己只应该对上级负责，对下级、对群众就可以不负责；认为自己的工作可以不受群众监督，因而对群众的意见可以置之不理。
    应该指出，对于群众的意见、群众的批评采取置之不理的官僚主义态度的现象，并不是个别的或少数的，而是相当普遍严重的。这种例子是很多的。我们在这里只举出某些领导机关对群众来信所采取的极端恶劣的态度就可以说明这个问题。山东省人民政府积压群众来信达七万多件，一般的县均积压三百多件。陕西长安县积压群众来信一千一百多件。福州市，仅根据十七个部门检查的结果，即积压群众来信三千二百八十五件，该市新店区积压的群众来信一百一十件，是经过三任区长长期积压下来的。据上海市三十一个机关不完全的统计，即积压群众来信两万两千多件，很多的检举箱塞满了群众来信，因积年不开，任日晒雨淋，很多已字迹难辨。这是决不能容忍的严重现象。
    对于来自下边、来自群众的批评采取置之不理的态度是压制批评的一种表现。压制批评的另一种，也是更加严重的一种表现是对批评者进行迫害和报复。这些行为在区、村干部中大量地存在着，而他们的这种行为又往往是在他们的上级的支持下进行的。比如山东滕县地委在处理济宁县赵王堂村干部严重的犯罪行为时，所采取的不可容忍的包庇态度，就是许多同类现象的代表。赵王堂村的干部和民兵，以王树坤、王树申为首罪恶累累，群众恨之入骨，说他们“比二鬼子还厉害”。但滕县地委却认为王树坤等“过去有功”，认为做这些坏事并不是村干部的责任，而是地主的阴谋活动，并且将反映王树坤等罪恶事实的孙怀堂父子等三人逮捕，甚至在山东分局电话通知释放这三人的时候，仍然抗不执行。直到分局一再批评，才逐渐被迫纠正了这一错误。从这件事情中可以看出，既然滕县地委对群众意见是采取这样的态度，像赵王堂村这样严重的问题长期得不到解决也就是很自然的了。更值得注意的是，这种对批评者施行迫害、报复的行为，在某些中级甚至高级干部中也存在着。“三反”初期我们所处理过的武汉市的“纪凯夫事件”就是一个典型例子。此外，我们还可以举出很多这样的事情，最近发生的华东交通部长黄逸峰对批评者施行报复的事件也是其中的一个。上边所说到的这些只是对批评者施行报复、打击的现象的一部分，这是比较公开、粗暴的一部分。有些人（包括某些高级干部）对批评者同样施行报复、甚至进行迫害，但他们不愿意采取这种公开、粗暴的报复办法，他们所采取的是另外一种——隐蔽的办法。即是当一个干部对他提出批评之后，他就想种种办法，找种种借口来“整”这个干部，并且可以找很多工作上的理由，搬很多“原则”来掩饰自己的报复行为，使被他“整”的人明知是在遭受报复，但讲不出口来。有些正直无私的干部，往往因为这样遭到打击，以至最后，从一个地方被排挤出去。我想我们对于这种极端损害党的利益的现象绝不能再容忍下去。应该指出，这同样是一种犯法行为，每一个爱护党的事业的人都应该向这种行为展开无情的斗争。马林科夫同志说：“以为自下而上的批评能够以自流的方式自动展开的看法，是错误的。只有在每一个提出健康的批评的人能够确实知道他可以得到我们组织的支持，确实知道他所指出的缺点会真正予以消除的时候，自下而上的批评才能展开和扩大。”这些话对我们是非常深切的。很显然，当一个人想要揭露和批评某种不良现象的时候，知道他所得到的将不是支持，而是报复和迫害，他的信心和勇气当然会要降低。我们如果不能用实际行动来证明我们对批评者的坚决支持，即使发出多少号召，也不会发生什么作用的。
    因此，我们必须“把那些阻碍对我们的缺点展开批评、压制批评及对批评者实行迫害与报复的人，当作党的死敌，与之进行无情的斗争”（马林科夫）。应该明确指出，压制批评及对批评者实行迫害与报复的行为是一种违犯党纪的行为，也是一种犯法的行为。对于犯有这种错误的党员，不管是多么高级的干部都必须给以严格的党的纪律的处分，直到开除其党籍。这些事件和党的处分决定应在报纸上公开宣布，以教育广大的党员和人民群众。
    经常保护群众的批评，发扬群众敢于提出批评的精神，这是促进我们党的进步和国家的兴旺的必要条件。斯大林同志告诉我们说：“当然，我们不能要求批评百分之百的正确。如果批评是从下而上来的，那末即使这个批评只是百分之五——十正确，我们也不应当加以轻视”。事实上，如果我们要求群众的每一件批评都要百分之百的正确，就会等于扼杀群众的批评。斯大林同志说：“……只要把这个要求试提出来，你们就会塞住成千成万愿意纠正我们的缺点但有时候还不善于正确地表达自己意思的工人、工人通讯员底口。这便是死路，而不是自我批评。”又说：“如果你们要求他们的批评百分之百正确，那末你们就会消灭任何来自下面的批评的可能性、任何自我批评的可能性。”但必要知道，群众的批评很多是正确的；即使有些不完全正确或不正确，我们也是必须加以注意的。这就是毛泽东同志所经常告诉我们的原则：“言者无罪，闻者足戒。”不遵守这样的原则去对待群众的批评，就是对党犯罪。
    第二、无组织无纪律的现象仍然很严重，特别是不反映工作中的缺点、“报喜不报忧”的现象十分严重。
    一九四八年党中央发出关于加强请示、报告制度，反对无政府、无纪律现象的指示以来，已经取得了重大的成绩，在全党范围内，组织性、纪律性和统一集中的程度都大大提高了一步。因此，保证了全国解放战争的胜利，保证了全国解放以来各种社会改革工作和经济恢复工作的胜利。但是，必须指出，直到今天为止，无组织无纪律的现象并没有完全克服，很多无组织无纪律的现象仍在不断发生。
    特别严重的，也是对党危害最大的一种现象，就是对上级只反映工作的成绩，而不讲工作中的缺点，“报喜不报忧”，“隐恶扬善”。很多地方很多部门在工作中是存在着问题的，甚至存在着严重的问题，但很少向上级报告。由于某些领导机关对工作的系统检查做得十分不够，有些人就利用这个弱点，将自己工作的成绩加以渲染扩大，对缺点则尽量掩饰，有时候他们也讲一些缺点，但只是轻描淡写的。因此，报告的情况与实际情况往往有很大出入。甚至当某些问题已为上级所发觉，向他们查问的时候，他们也不愿把真实情况全盘拿出，只是把不得不讲的一部分报告上来，能掩盖的还要尽量掩盖。特别危险的则是某些党委和某些部门的领导同志对这样一些严重的违犯党的纪律的现象竟习以为常，不觉得这样做有什么错误。
    这种“报喜不报忧”的现象又可以分为两种：（1）由于官僚主义作风，不调查，不研究，不了解真实情况，下级报告什么，就照样给上级报告什么。（2）明知工作中有缺点、有问题，却有意隐瞒，唯恐上级发现自己的工作做得不好，对自己有所不利；如果有人向上级反映了这些缺点和问题，则尽量掩盖和推脱责任。
    这两种现象都是极端错误的，不可容忍的。后一种比前一种尤为恶劣。这种掩盖工作缺点的人，对人民群众的利益，是并不关心的，他们所关心的只是自己的“名誉”、“威望”和上级对自己的“印象”。因此，当工作中发生严重的缺点或错误的时候，他们并不去追查清楚，更不要说去认真纠正，但当别人反映他们的工作中有问题、有错误的时候，却要立即追查：“是谁反映的？”他们可以下很大的功夫调查是那个人向上级说了他的坏话，然后，用对待敌人的态度来对待这个反映了真实情况的人。这种错误的进一步发展就是写假报告。写假报告的人不是根据工作的实际情况来写报告。他们写报告的目的是为了骗取上级的信任。因此，他们口袋里装的东西很多，要什么有什么。上级喜欢什么，他就拿出什么来。
    当然，有些“假报告”也并不是全无根据的。有些人知道编造那种全无根据的假报告是太危险了。所以，他们总是多少找一点“根据”，甚至勉强制造几个“典型”，再加以鼓吹和扩大。但是他们自己心里很清楚，这些“典型”，这些“根据”，并不能代表工作的真实情况。他们所以要这样作，只是准备当他们的假报告被揭穿之后，还多少能找一点理由来搪塞。
    对于这种严重地违犯党的纪律，腐蚀和瓦解党的战斗力，破坏党的统一集中的现象，我们绝不应该予以姑息和容忍。“党要求全体党员，特别是领导干部，要忠诚老实，要认真履行他们对党和国家的责任。党是不能信任那些在行动上危害国家的利益，企图对政府耍手腕，欺骗党和国家的人的。任何欺骗党和国家的行为，不论采取的是什么方式，任何欺骗的企图，不论是隐瞒真相也好，歪曲真相也好，都只能被认为是极严重的违害党的罪行。”（马林科夫）有些领导干部，他们在口头上也说应该对党忠诚老实，但是他们的实际行动却是另一回事。对这样的人，党必须用严厉的办法来对待他们。如果他们不能诚恳地承认自己的错误，并确实改正这些错误，党就应该把他们从领导岗位上撤掉，并予以应得的处分，直到开除其党籍。
    我们过去对某些犯错误的干部迁就、“照顾”太多了。当某一个干部犯了错误之后，常常以这个干部“过去对革命曾有过贡献”，而加以原谅。这样，就损害了党的纪律的严肃性。这个缺点，我们必须坚决加以克服。应该强调这样一点：我们的党只有一个纪律，不论是普通党员或领导干部都同样要受它的约束，任何人违犯了党的纪律，都应在同样的原则下，受到应得的处分，绝对不允许因某一个人的资格和地位，而有任何迁就与姑息。绝对不允许任何人假借什么“过去有功”而掩盖他现在所犯的过错。
    今后，除严格执行党的纪律，加强党的生活和对党员的教育，加强对党的政策和决议执行情况的自上而下的检查外；还必须特别注意开展自下而上的批评，充分地发扬民主，把党的组织、党的工作放在广大的党员和群众的监督之下。要作到这一点，一定会遇到很多困难，只有我们下了很大的决心，并坚决地领导广大党员和群众对各种阻碍力量进行顽强的斗争，才能有效地克服上述各种无组织、无纪律和违法乱纪的恶劣现象。
    第三、在我们挑选干部和了解干部的工作中存在着严重的弱点，存在着“资格论”、“重才不重德”和“任人唯亲”的偏向。用官僚主义和形式主义的办法，只从表面现象来看干部，对干部缺乏深刻考察的现象极为普遍。
    首先是挑选干部的标准问题。挑选干部的标准只应有一个，就是毛泽东同志提出的“德才兼备”的标准，而不应该是任何其他的标准。“德”就是一个干部的政治品质，“才”就是一个干部的业务能力，两方面必须结合而不可偏废。
    这个标准本来是很明确的，但很多地方和很多部门在实际挑选干部时往往不是按照这个标准来进行的。很多地方和很多部门还是首先根据干部的资格、历史来确定一个干部的工作职务。因此，就造成这样一些现象：一个干部政治品质与业务能力都很好，并适合于担负某种职务，只是由于资格不够，而不委任他去担负那个职务；同时另一个干部政治品质和业务能力都不如前一个干部，并且对那个职务也不甚适合，只是由于他的资格老，就勉强委任他去担负那个职务，结果工作当然受了损失。很明显，为了不断地把党的事业推向前进，我们就必须打破这种错误的“资格论”，大胆提拔那些“德才兼备”的后起的优秀干部，给他们以支持和帮助，使他们胜任地担负起自己的工作职务；对于那些资格虽老但进步很慢的干部则应该加以鞭策和督促，使他们继续前进；而对那些虽然有长期的斗争历史，虽然对革命事业有过一些贡献，但由于骄傲自满、不求进步，“饱食终日，无所用心”，已经丧失了政治的敏感，因而不再适合于他们所担任的领导职务的人，则应该把他们从现有的领导岗位上撤换下来，分配他们去做另一种他们所能够胜任的工作。
    在挑选干部工作中的另一种错误倾向，是重才不重德的思想。这种错误思想在许多经济部门的领导干部中是很严重的。比如有些经济部门的领导者认为“德才兼备”的干部实际上是没有的，因此说：“两个干部在一块，一个有才，一个有德，凑起来就行了。”有的说：“我胆子大，敢用人，历史政治问题是过去的事，现在不会反革命了。”还有的说：“有德无才搞党群，有才无德搞行政”。有的就任意修改党的挑选干部的原则，有的甚至提出了“三分政治，七分业务”的错误原则。
    由于存在着这样一些错误思想，很多人就把“技术”、“文化程度”当作挑选干部的唯一条件，而根本不去注意考察一个干部的政治品质。有些领导者信任那些没有经过认真的思想改造和政治考察的旧人员，仅仅认为他们有技术、文化程度高，就主要依靠这些人来做工作，因而使工作做不好，错误的思想和作风也发展起来，甚至使一些坏分子占据了某些部门的领导职务，造成工作上的严重损失。在“三反”运动时，从中央到各省、市，很多部门暴露出严重的干部不纯的现象，其原因虽然很多，但单纯重视业务能力，忽视政治品质则是各种原因中的最重要的一个原因。
    这当然不是说，一个干部是否具有一定的业务能力，对党的事业是无关紧要的；恰恰相反，我们对干部业务能力的提高应该予以十分重视。由于经济的恢复时期已提前结束，大规模的经济建设已经开始，广大的干部都将逐渐在专业的工作中固定下来。因此，党必须认真指导我们的干部去钻研业务，指导他们去学会自己不懂得的或不熟悉的东西，这是十分重要的。做不到这点，一切建设计划都将成为纸上空谈。近几年来的经验证明，学会一门专门的本领确实不是一件容易的事情，必须有“头悬梁，锥刺股”的精神，有决心克服一切困难，才能逐渐学会。就近几年来干部钻研业务的成果来看，有三种不同的情形：第一种人，真正下了苦功，因此钻进去了；第二种人，下了一点功夫，但很不够，钻进去一些，但很肤浅；第三种人，没有下什么功夫，因此，根本没有钻进去，仍然是一窍不通。对第一种人应该鼓励，并帮助他们继续前进；对第二种人应该承认他们的进步，但同时指出他们的缺点，并督促他们加速赶上；对第三种人应该予以严厉批评，如果他们仍然没有转变和进步，就叫他们把位子让出来，用另外一些愿意下苦功钻研的人去代替他们，而不能让他们继续贻误工作。
    但是当一个干部已经对某种业务“钻进去”之后，我们就必须注意防止另外一种倾向，这就是“只问业务，不问政治”的倾向。前边所说的那种在挑选干部时“重才轻德”的倾向，就是脱离政治倾向的一种表现。当这些同志已经把全部精神集中到某种业务上的时候，他们对总的方向，对政治原则的注意力就可能逐渐减少，如果不及时提起注意，他们的眼光就会逐渐变得狭小近视起来，就会忘记了全局，忘记了总的形势和任务，而只看到自己所从事的那一部分业务。因而他们的工作也就可能离开党的政策、方针，在政治上发生错误。斯大林同志教导我们说：“在国家工作和党工作任何一个部门中，工作人员的政治水准和马列主义觉悟程度愈高，工作本身也愈高，愈有成效，工作的结果也愈有效力；反过来说，工作人员的政治水准和马列主义觉悟程度愈低，工作中的延误和失败也愈多，工作人员本身也会愈加变为鼠目寸光的小人，堕落成为一些只图眼前利益的事务主义者，而他们也就愈易蜕化变节，——这要算是一个定理。”“（列宁主义问题”莫斯科外国文书籍出版局中文版第七八二页）党的领导的责任，就在于不断地提醒这些同志，尖锐地反对一切脱离政治的倾向，不断地提高他们的政治水准和马克思列宁主义觉悟程度，只有这样，才能帮助这些同志真正把他们的业务办好。
    挑选干部工作中还有一种更危险的现象，就是有些领导者离开党的原则，引用自己的亲戚、朋友和同乡故旧。这种事情是很多的，这里我们只举前东北劳动部长唐韵超介绍到劳动部门的地主、资本家、旧警察、叛徒、特务嫌疑犯达四十二人之多的事实就够了。这样就使得不少党的组织和政府机关中一团和气，缺乏政治空气，组织生活不健全，批评与自我批评展不开，甚至相互包庇。在这样的情况下，往往使一些正直的有思想能力的干部遭到排斥和打击。
    其次，是我们了解干部的工作做得非常不够。用官僚主义和形式主义的办法去了解干部的现象极为普遍。很多组织部门只是根据一个干部的履历表，和档案材料来认识这个干部，这当然是很不够的。但最主要的缺点是，某些领导机关只是根据一个干部向上级所做的报告，根据一个干部所做工作的表面成绩——完成任务的数字，来认识这个干部；而不是从和这个干部的直接接触中，从检查他的工作中，从他完成任务的方法、工作的质量和实际结果中来认识这个干部。因此，有些不好的干部由于他会做报告，会显示他工作的成绩——这种成绩有很多是夸大的或者是用违犯政策、强迫命令的办法取得的——而被上级认为是好干部；相反地，那些脚踏实地，埋头工作，认真执行党的政策的干部倒可能被上级认为是不好的，没有能力的干部。很显然的，这是一种很危险的现象。
    为了克服这种现象，除各级党的领导机关必须逐步地但是坚决地采用与干部直接接触的方法，采用检查干部的实际工作的方法去了解干部以外，还应该注意从下边、从群众中去了解干部。我们过去即使做了一些了解干部的工作，也是从上边去了解的多，很少注意到下层的群众的意见。但是，缺乏这一方面的意见，我们对干部的了解就是不完整的。领导的看法和群众的看法都有一定的局限性，只有当我们知道了两方面的看法，并经过研究分析之后，把两方面的意见结合起来，才能够得到对一个干部的完整的认识。
    第四、在很多党和政府的领导机关中还存在着相当严重的官僚主义和形式主义的作风。在党和政府的下层组织中普遍存在的强迫命令、脱离群众的现象还远未得到克服。
    去年的“三反”运动取得了极大的成绩。在这个运动中基本上解决了专区、省市、大行政区和中央四级许多工作人员中的贪污、浪费两个问题，也基本上解决了许多领导者和机关群众相脱离的这一部分官僚主义的问题，但是如果因为有了这些成绩，就认为在党和政府的领导机关中，官僚主义已经不是一个严重的问题，那就不妥当了。
    事实证明，官僚主义和形式主义的作风，在我们很多党和政府的领导机关中是相当严重的。这种官僚主义和形式主义的特点是：不了解下边的真实情况，不了解和不关心群众的疾苦，不是切实地从客观的实际条件出发，来考虑和决定他们的工作，而往往是从不真实的情况出发，不分工作的缓急轻重，而只凭主观的愿望，来考虑和决定他们的工作。因此，提出的工作任务往往过多、过重，而且要求过急，使下边十分紧张、忙碌，到处“疲于奔命”，而不能做好工作，加以在布置工作的时候，只是简单地强调要“完成任务”，不明确具体地向下级交代政策界限，不明确具体地交代工作作风与工作方法；在布置工作之后又很少进行检查，只满足于下级所报告的工作的表面成绩，而不注意工作的实际效果；只看到工作中好的方面，看不到工作中坏的方面；只追求数量，不讲究质量；这样，就助长了下层组织和下层干部的“单纯任务观点”和强迫命令作风，把很多好事办坏，使人民群众的利益遭到损失，并使党与群众的联系受到破坏。
    有些领导干部，虽然口头上也在反对官僚主义、形式主义的作风，但实际上他们正犯着官僚主义和形式主义的错误。他们不深入下层，不了解情况，不检查工作，所以很容易听信一些“报喜不报忧”的报告，很容易被一些工作的表面成绩所迷惑，也就很容易产生一种盲目的乐观情绪，认为工作是好的，成绩是大的，缺点虽然也有，但并不值得特别注意，因而松懈麻痹，粗心大意，不知道下边究竟发生了一些什么样的严重问题。往往有些问题在下边已发展得十分严重，领导机关还根本不知道，或者虽然知道一些，但并没有看做是一个重要的问题，结果使很多严重损害人民群众利益的现象，长期存在并继续发展下去。
    有些领导干部，热情很高，愿望很好，他们愿意给群众多办一些好事，但因为他们沾染了官僚主义的作风，不注意怎样切实地把这些事情办好，不懂得走群众路线，不懂得和群众共同商量来办事，结果和他们的愿望恰好相反，工作的实际效果很坏，不是给群众办了好事，而是增加了群众的痛苦。很显然，对于这样的领导干部，党并不能因为他们有给群众办好事的愿望而加以原谅。因为党并不是根据一个领导干部的愿望来判断他是否完成了党所交给他的任务，而是根据他所领导的那个地区或部门的工作的实际结果来判断他是否完成了党所交给他的任务。应该指出：不管他们的热情多高、愿望多好，只要他们还没有去掉自己身上的官僚主义作风，党就有责任认真地教育他们，严厉地批评他们，如果他们还不能下决心改正，并继续造成人民群众的损失，党就应该给他们以应得的处分，以至把他们从领导岗位上撤换下来。
    和上述的官僚主义、形式主义作风有密切联系的，是党与政府的区、乡组织和一部分县的组织强迫命令、脱离群众的现象。这种现象还是极为普遍、严重的。许多地方在农业生产、爱国卫生运动等直接为群众谋利益的工作中也存在着严重的强迫命令现象。在这种恶劣的作风支配下，像组织群众打井抗旱、推广优良品种、发放农业贷款、打防疫针等这样一些和群众当前的现实利益紧密结合的工作，也会造成群众极大的痛苦，也会闹得群众叫苦连天。这种事实很多，不能不说是一个十分严重的问题。
    此外，在很多地方，区、乡干部和一部分县干部违法乱纪、打击批评、包庇反革命、诬陷好人等现象也是极端严重的。
    这些现象的存在，严重地危害了人民群众的利益，歪曲了党的政策，破坏了党与群众的联系。很显然，这是一种极恶劣的反人民的作风，是和我们党的作风绝不相容的。这种作风就它的社会根源来讲，就是反动统治阶级对付人民的反动作风（也就是国民党作风）的残余在我们党和政府内的反映。和这种坏作风进行斗争，不仅在目前是一个重大问题，而且在今后一个很长的时期内也将是一个重大问题。
    这种作风的存在，与很多下层组织、下层干部成份不纯和思想作风不纯是有直接关系的。
    这说明了我们对各级干部，特别是对县、区、乡三级干部还没有进行过审查，或者是审查工作做得还很不好。这也说明了县、区、乡三级整党工作还没有取得应有的成效，还没有在整党中开展反对命令主义和清除违法乱纪分子的斗争。此外，还有一个重要原因，就是前边所说到的，在很多党和政府的领导机关中还存在着严重的官僚主义。很多高级的领导机关不了解人民群众的疾苦，不了解县、区、乡三级干部中存在着许多命令主义和违法乱纪的坏人坏事，或者虽然对于这些坏人坏事有一些了解，但是熟视无睹，不引起义愤，不感觉问题的严重，因而不采取积极的办法去支持好人，惩治坏人，发扬好事，消灭坏事，使这些严重的现象得以存在和得以发展。同时很多上级机关只向下级要任务、要数字，而不能明确具体地向下级交代政策，划清该做的事情与不该做的事情的界限；不能明确具体地教给下级进行某种工作的方法；不注意检查工作，不去认真发动党员、群众开展自下而上的批评，这就更助长了命令主义、脱离群众的现象。
    因此，我们不能把党和政府的下层组织的强迫命令、脱离群众的问题，只看作是这些组织本身的问题，而必须把这些问题和领导上的官僚主义、形式主义联系起来看。并且只有认真纠正了领导机关的官僚主义和形式主义，才有可能进一步彻底纠正党和政府的下层组织的这些错误。
    同志们：我认为以上所说的四个问题，就是我们目前党组织的生活中所存在的消极的和不健康的主要现象。这些现象之所以在我们党组织内长期存在的一个重要原因，正如马林科夫同志所讲的，是“低估了思想工作的重要性”。这就是说，“党机关削弱了对党的组织工作与思想工作的注意，因此，在党的许多组织里，这种工作变得无人管了。”毛泽东同志在一九四八年所讲的“党不管党”的现象，至今还没有改变或没有多大的改变。
    为了进一步巩固我们的党，加强党与人民群众的联系，消除忽视党的组织工作和思想工作的现象，提高党的工作水平，彻底消灭在我们党组织内所存在的消极的和不健康的现象，我们必须采取一些积极的有效的措施。马林科夫同志所讲的巩固党的五项任务对我们党也是适用的。为了更加适合我们党的具体情况，我认为应该规定出下述几项办法：
    一、在党内，在一切基层组织内，在党校和党的训练班内，在一切党报党刊上，在党的一切会议上，进行有系统的教育，使全体党员认识这些现象对党和人民事业的危害，认识到容忍这些现象是与党的原则、党员的义务不相容的，必须坚决地为消除这些现象而进行积极的工作和斗争。
    二、党委、党报、党的纪律检查委员会要用一切方法保证发扬党内民主，展开自我批评和自下而上的批评，以此作为检查党委工作和党报工作的重要标准之一。严惩并公布压制批评和对批评施行报复的人。配合国家的选举，在党内认真地实行民主的选举。
    三、对无组织无纪律现象继续进行坚决的斗争，不放松任何一件事来进行纪律教育，严格党的各项制度，加强党的纪律检查委员会的工作。
    四、改善干部工作的方法，有系统地宣传和遵守党的挑选干部的正确原则，尽量把挑选干部和检查执行情况的工作结合起来，并使之真正成为领导工作的主要点。
    五、准备在今年进行一次以反对官僚主义、反对命令主义、反对违法乱纪为重点的整风运动。加强监察机关的工作。使各级干部认识在分配工作、使用干部时必须同时交代工作方法和工作纪律。
    六、加强党的思想工作。一切党的组织必须把思想工作放在首要地位。巩固整党教育的成果，建立经常的支部教育。巩固对联共十九次代表大会文件学习的成果，建立经常的干部教育。防止在经济建设高潮中忽视政治工作，防止削弱党的宣传机关。任何党员和党的组织都必须负起向群众宣传解释党的主张的义务。
