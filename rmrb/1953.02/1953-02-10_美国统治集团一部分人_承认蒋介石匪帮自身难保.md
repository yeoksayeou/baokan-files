Xinhua News Agency, February 9th—Eisenhower's attempt to use the Kuomintang bandit gang as a tool to attack the Chinese people has not only aroused opposition from all over the world, but even some people in the U.S. ruling clique believe that if the U.S. does this, it will not harm China but will make Chiang Kai-shek a transportation captain for China again.

After the news that Eisenhower was about to employ the Kuomintang bandit gang, U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Bradley believed that whether the Kuomintang bandit gang could attack the mainland in the "near future" was "still questionable." Prior to this, Bradley had testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that the Kuomintang bandit gang "not only lacks jets, warships, and tanks, but also lacks basic necessities such as shoes." He admitted that the Kuomintang bandit gang not only lacked the ability to attack the Chinese mainland, but also apparently could not even hold the island of Taiwan. According to the Associated Press, American "military experts" also warned against "placing too much hope" in the Kuomintang bandit gang. They said, "It is still a long way off for Chiang Kai-shek to launch a full-scale offensive against the Chinese Communists, and at best we can only expect them to carry out some hit-and-run attacks." The U.S. "Washington Post" even published a commentary entitled "Chiang Kai-shek - Transportation Captain," saying, "If we plan to give Chiang more supplies and let him attack the Chinese mainland, then he may become a transportation team for the Communist Party. He played this role in the past when fighting the Communist Party, so the Communist Party called him their transportation captain."

British Labour MP Bevan also felt the same way. He expressed his opinion in London on the 4th, believing that if the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang launched an "adventure" against the Chinese mainland, it would mean that the United States would continue to supply it with a large number of weapons. He said, "Of course, the Communist Party will get these things." India's "Delhi Express" said, "It is ridiculous to say that Chiang Kai-shek has the military strength to launch an offensive against the Chinese mainland." Britain's "Times" pointed out that the United States' employment of the Kuomintang bandit gang would only make the Chinese people more closely united. The newspaper said: "Chiang Kai-shek is regarded in China as a reactionary exile force, and all successful revolutions have shown that there is nothing more capable of uniting the people closely around the revolutionary leader than the threat of interference by exiles supported by other countries."

Even the Kuomintang bandit gang does not believe that they can bear Eisenhower's orders. According to Agence France-Presse, some members of the Kuomintang bandit gang in Tokyo, Japan, revealed that the Kuomintang bandit gang "did not want to make this decision so quickly" because "the Kuomintang army had not even completed the preparations for a small-scale offensive against the Chinese mainland." But, as the "Christian Science Monitor" said, the United States decided to "regard Chiang Kai-shek as a useful tool of their own policy, rather than regarding the U.S. military power as a tool of Chiang's policy." Eisenhower decided to use this tool to scare the Chinese people first, but he not only did not scare the Chinese people at all, but scared the U.S. ruling clique itself and their running dog Kuomintang bandit gang.

### 美国统治集团一部分人  承认蒋介石匪帮自身难保

    美国统治集团一部分人
    承认蒋介石匪帮自身难保 【新华社九日讯】艾森豪威尔企图拿国民党匪帮充当进攻中国人民的工具，不仅已经激起了全世界的反对，就是美国统治集团中的一部分人也认为如果美国这样作不但对中国无损，并将使蒋介石再度变成中国的运输大队长。
    在艾森豪威尔将要起用国民党匪帮的消息传出以后，美国参谋长联席会议主席布莱德雷认为国民党匪帮是否能在“最近将来”进攻大陆，“尚属疑问”。在此以前，布莱德雷曾经在参议院外交委员会上作证说，国民党匪帮“不但缺少喷气机、兵舰与坦克，而且还缺少像鞋子之类的基本必需品”。他承认国民党匪帮非但没有能力进攻中国大陆，而且显然还保不住台湾岛。据合众社报道，美国的“军事专家”们也发出警告说，对国民党匪帮不要“抱太多的希望”。他们说，“蒋介石对中共进行全面的进攻还是很遥远的事，我们充其量只能够期望他们进行一些打了就跑的袭击。”美国的“华盛顿邮报”更以“蒋介石—运输大队长”为题发表评论说，“如果我们计划给蒋更多供应品，让他袭击中国大陆，那么，他便可能变成共产党的运输队。他在过去和共产党作战时，就起过这种作用，因此，共产党把他叫做是他们的运输大队长。”
    英国工党议员比万也有同感。他在四日在伦敦发表意见，认为如果蒋介石匪帮向中国大陆发动“冒险”，将意味着美国继续以大量武器供应给它。他说，“当然，共产党将得到这些东西的。”印度的“德里快报”说，“如果说蒋介石有军事实力向中国大陆发动攻势，那是荒谬可笑的”。英国的“泰晤士报”指出，美国起用国民党匪帮，只会使中国人民更加紧密团结起来。该报说：“蒋介石在中国被认为是反动的流亡势力，而一切成功的革命经过都说明：没有比流亡者在其它国家的支持下进行干涉的威胁，更能够使人民密切地团结在革命领袖的周围了。”
    就是国民党匪帮也不相信自己承当得起艾森豪威尔的命令。据法新社报道，在日本东京的国民党匪帮中有人透露，国民党匪帮“并不希望这样快就作出这个决定”，因为“国民党军队连小规模进攻中国大陆的准备工作也没有完成”。但是，正如“基督教科学箴言报”所说的，美国决定“把蒋介石看作他们自己政策的有用工具，而不是把美国的军事力量看作蒋的政策的工具”。艾森豪威尔决定首先拿这个工具来吓唬中国人民，可是他不仅丝毫吓不着中国人民，反到吓着了美国统治集团自己和他们的走狗国民党匪帮。
