    Strengthen Technical Guidance on Manure Accumulation and Application
    At present, the situation of manure accumulation and application in rural areas across the country is still characterized by insufficient quantity and unsatisfactory quality. Therefore, universally increasing fertilizer and improving fertilizer quality remains a crucial factor in increasing agricultural production.
    The key to the current manure accumulation campaign is to promote high-yield experience and strengthen technical guidance. When high-yield experience is promoted, and farmers realize that rational application of fertilizer can indeed increase production, they will actively and voluntarily accumulate manure. After many places in Northeast China promoted the Zhaoyuan high-yield experience, many farmers actively explored fertilizer sources and delivered manure to the fields early, breaking the old habit of not delivering manure before the Spring Festival. Strengthening technical guidance is even more necessary. This is because: First, many farmers originally believed that excessive fertilization would cause crops to lodge and grow excessively; some "high-yield fields" did indeed reduce production last year or failed to complete their high-yield plans for this reason. If the principle of applying fertilizer in stages and classifications is not told to the peasant masses, it will be impossible to break their conservative thinking on this issue. Second, without technical guidance, farmers will not know that different crops require different fertilizers, what different effects different fertilizers have, when crops need what fertilizers, what things can be used as fertilizers, what is suitable as base fertilizer, and what is suitable as top dressing. Without knowing these things, they will discard things that can be used as fertilizer and apply things that cannot be used as fertilizer to the land. This will waste manpower and material resources and fail to achieve the goal of increasing production. Third, without technical guidance, the quality of fertilizer cannot be improved. Many farmers do not know that fertilizer should be fermented, or do not know how to ferment fertilizer, do not know that the fertilizer effect will be lost when plant ash and human and animal manure are put together, and that the fertilizer effect will also be lost if human and animal manure is not padded with soil or covered with soil. In this way, much fertilizer will be wasted.
    To promote high-yield experience and strengthen technical guidance, leading cadres must first study technology. The general technical knowledge of manure accumulation and application is not very profound, and the general county and district cadres are fully capable of mastering it. As long as they are willing to learn, they can learn. Now the spring plowing season is coming soon. Manure accumulation and delivery is one of the main preparations for spring plowing, and we should quickly seize the time and do it well. We must learn agricultural technology and strengthen specific leadership, and we should take the preparation work for this year's spring plowing as a good start.

### 加强对积肥施肥的技术指导

    加强对积肥施肥的技术指导
    目前全国各地农村积肥、施肥的情况仍然是数量不足、质量不高；因此，普遍地增加肥料和提高肥料质量，还是提高农产品产量的一个十分重要的因素。
    当前开展积肥运动的关键是推广丰产经验和加强技术指导。推广了丰产经验，农民认识到合理增施肥料确实能够增产，就会积极地主动地积肥。东北许多地方推广肇源丰产经验后，很多农民就积极开辟肥料来源，并且提早把粪送到了地里，打破了春节以前不送粪的旧习惯。加强技术指导更是非常必要的。这是因为：一、许多农民本来就认为多施肥庄稼会倒伏、会疯长；去年有些“丰产田”也确实因此减产了，或未完成丰产计划。如果不把分期分类施肥的道理告诉给农民群众，就不可能打破他们在这个问题上的保守思想。二、不进行技术指导，农民就不知道不同的作物需要不同的肥料，不同的肥料有些什么不同的作用，作物什么时间需要什么肥料，什么东西可以做肥料，什么宜于作基肥，什么宜于作追肥。不知道这些，就会把能作肥料的东西抛弃了，把不能作肥料的东西上到了地里。这就会浪费人力物力，达不到增产的目的。三、不进行技术指导，就不能提高肥料质量。许多农民不知道肥料应当经过发酵，或者不知道怎样使肥料发酵，不知道草木灰和人畜粪尿放在一起会损失肥效，人畜粪尿不垫土不盖土也会损失肥效。这样，也就把许多肥料浪费了。
    要推广丰产经验和加强技术指导，领导干部首先要学习技术。积肥、施肥的一般的技术常识并不是怎么深奥的，一般的县区干部完全能够掌握它。只要肯学，就能学会。现在春耕时节很快就要到了。积肥送粪是春耕的主要准备工作之一，应该赶快抓紧，把它做好。我们要学习农业技术，加强具体领导，就应把今年的春耕准备工作做为一个很好的开端。
