Reader's Letters Abstract

    Suggest that the Central Ministry of Light Industry and other units pay attention to hop cultivation.
    Zhu Mei writes: Hops are a climbing plant and an important raw material for brewing beer. In the past, all the hops needed for brewing beer in our country were imported from foreign countries, requiring a large amount of foreign exchange every year. In 1951, Wang Wanzhong, a resident of Liuba County, Shaanxi Province, reported to the government that there were wild hops in the county. The China Monopoly Corporation sent someone to investigate. After research, it was proved that the hops produced in this area are the best red vine variety in the world, and can be used with slight cultivation and improvement. The company also planned to invest jointly with several state-owned breweries in the fourth quarter of 1952 to cooperate with local farmers in cultivation. Later, due to the separation of production and sales of the monopoly business, the plan failed to materialize. The China Monopoly Corporation had to print and distribute the analysis report of Chinese wild hops to various central departments for reference, hoping to attract everyone's attention. However, no response has been received since the report was sent out. I hope that the Central Ministry of Light Industry, the Ministry of Agriculture, and the Shaanxi Provincial People's Government will pay attention to this new discovery and cultivate this plant in a planned way.

专栏：读者来信摘要

    建议中央轻工业部等单位重视酒花培植工作
    朱梅来信：酒花是一种攀旋植物，是酿造啤酒的重要原料。过去我国酿造啤酒所需的酒花全部靠外国进口，每年需要支出很大的一笔外汇。一九五一年，陕西留坝县居民王万中向政府反映该县有野生酒花，中国专卖事业公司曾派人前往调查，经过研究证明，该地所产酒花系世界上最好的红蔓品种，稍加培植、改良即可使用。该公司并计划在一九五二年第四季度由几个国营啤酒厂联合投资，与当地农民合作进行培植。后因专卖事业产、销分开，计划未能实现。中国专卖事业公司只好将中国野生酒花分析报告印发中央各部门参考，希望引起大家的重视。但报告送出后，至今仍没有得到任何反应。我希望中央轻工业部、农业部和陕西省人民政府对这
    一新发现加以重视，并有计划地对这种植物进行培植。
