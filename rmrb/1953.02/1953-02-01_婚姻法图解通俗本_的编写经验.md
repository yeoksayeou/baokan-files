    Experience in Compiling the "Illustrated Popular Edition of the Marriage Law"
    East China People's Publishing House
    The "Illustrated Popular Edition of the Marriage Law" published by our publishing house has been welcomed by a wide readership since its publication in November 1951. By November 1952, 18,362,000 copies had been printed. This, in addition to demonstrating the urgent need of the broad readership for political and cultural materials, also shows that this book is relatively well-suited to the needs of the readership. In order to better improve our future work, we would like to introduce our experience in compiling this book.
      The Compilation Process
    In the spring of 1951, the "Illustrated Popular Edition of the Regulations on the Punishment of Counterrevolutionaries," compiled and printed by our publishing house, was warmly welcomed by the broad masses. Many readers requested that we compile and print other important policies and laws into illustrated popular editions. At this time, it happened to be the first anniversary of the promulgation of the Marriage Law. Local inspections of marriage issues after the promulgation of the Marriage Law revealed that the phenomena of not implementing the Marriage Law and not studying the Marriage Law were still very serious. Therefore, in August, we officially decided to compile and print the "Illustrated Popular Edition of the Marriage Law."
    Initially, without carefully studying the compilation methods, we completely followed the experience of compiling the "Illustrated Popular Edition of the Regulations on the Punishment of Counterrevolutionaries," providing simple and concise explanations of the meanings of the regulations, along with explanations of the definitions of words. During the compilation process, we realized that such a compilation would inevitably become an explanation of the regulations for the sake of explaining the regulations. The Regulations on the Punishment of Counterrevolutionaries mostly involved specific standards for sentencing; the issues were clear, and there was no need for much explanation. However, the popularization work of the Marriage Law must involve issues of ideological understanding. This is because the influence of feudal ideas left over from feudal society on the people did not completely disappear with the elimination of the feudal economic foundation. Only by publicizing the Marriage Law while also dispelling the incorrect ideological understanding of marriage issues among the masses can the masses ideologically distinguish between the new and old marriage systems and can the Marriage Law be truly accepted by the masses. But after such a revision, it seemed repetitive and tedious, and it still could not solve the ideological understanding issues and specific problems among the masses. For example, Article 2 of the Marriage Law involves how to handle bigamy and concubinage before the implementation of the Marriage Law, whether one can remarry if one cannot have children, how to handle child brides before the implementation of the Marriage Law, why it is necessary to prohibit interference with the freedom of widows to marry, how to handle children and property when widows remarry, and why it is prohibited to demand money or property through marriage relationships. These issues cannot be explained clearly if only a popular explanation of the regulations is given. Therefore, the compilation method of this manuscript was finally determined: in addition to providing popular explanations of the wording of the regulations, all issues involving ideological understanding were marked with subheadings for key explanations; some specific issues were explained according to relevant documents.
    The first draft was completed on August 20. It was first given to comrades in the Current Affairs and Political Popularization Section for their opinions, then reviewed and revised by the leadership. The original manuscript was then mimeographed and sent to relevant departments in East China for review; several copies were also sent to the People's Publishing House, not only for their review but also for them to forward to relevant central departments for review. At the same time, the First Section of the Art Editing Department of our publishing house organized comrades from the Shanghai Artists Association to provide illustrations. Starting from October 8, the illustrations of the manuscript were published continuously in the "Liberation Daily" to solicit readers' opinions.
    The opinions of the relevant departments in East China were collected by the end of September, and the opinions of the relevant central departments were collected by the end of October. They all provided many extremely valuable opinions. Among them, what was particularly important was the point that this manuscript should focus on publicity from a social and political perspective. Based on this instruction, we added a preface, explaining the great political significance of implementing the Marriage Law. The places that originally focused on explaining from the perspective of life phenomena were then supplemented and rewritten, focusing on explaining from a political and essential perspective. For example, in explaining why the feudal marriage system should be abolished, the original explanation did not point out the close connection between the feudal marriage system and the entire feudal social system, but only explained it in isolation from the husband-wife relationship and the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law relationship. Therefore, it was impossible to explain the basic spirit of the Marriage Law clearly. After further revisions, the political and ideological content of this book was greatly strengthened.
    Finally, the proofs were sent to the Propaganda Department of the East China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and the People's Publishing House for approval, and it went to press on November 19, 1951.
    The Impact of the Book
    By November 1952, 18,362,000 copies of the "Illustrated Popular Edition of the Marriage Law" had been printed. According to incomplete statistics, it was reprinted by fourteen newspapers and periodicals across the country; several women's federations and propaganda departments wrote to us requesting permission to reproduce the illustrations into large posters; many masses posted the reproduced illustrations in factories, neighborhoods, streets, and store windows; many local women's federations, Youth League branches, trade unions, and people's schools used the book as teaching material to organize study and discussion.
    According to the collected mass feedback, this book has penetrated the masses and has played a certain role in the current political life of the people. In particular, women who have suffered the most from feudal marriage persecution have shown a high degree of love for the book. According to Dong Yingzhen, the cultural and educational committee member of Pandun Township, Minhou, Fujian, the number of women who bought this book accounted for more than 70% of the total number of books sold in the township. They paid for the book with the money they earned from fishing and growing vegetables. After Guo Saiying bought the book, she asked someone to explain it to her, and she forgot to cook while listening. She said: "Marriage is a major event for us. I cannot be half-informed." Wang Guihua, a woman, said: "In the past, it was difficult for us women to live under the old marriage system. Today, with the Marriage Law, we have someone to support us. I will buy this book even if I have to go hungry."
    Many rural cadres believe that this book has regulations, explanations, and uses comparisons between new and old marriages to explain things clearly and profoundly. Many propagandists and women's federation cadres reported that with this book, they have powerful materials for publicizing the Marriage Law. An old woman cried when she heard someone explain this book. It turned out that two of her daughters had sacrificed their lives under the unreasonable feudal system. She said: "This book is right and reasonable. I will never dare to arrange my children's marriages again. I will also buy a copy to help publicize it."
    This book has helped the masses solve marriage problems. Many young men and women, after studying this book, broke through the shackles of feudal families, publicly announced their legitimate love affairs, and abolished unreasonable marriage contracts; children of divorced parents received the support they deserved; the bad habit of early marriage was corrected; and the mistaken idea of treating the Marriage Law as a divorce law was criticized.
    A Few Experiences
    In the process of compiling, we have also gained some experience. First of all, when compiling popular readings, attention should be paid to explaining from the essence and from a political perspective; only in this way can the readings have strong political and ideological content. In the early stages of compiling this book, it was mistakenly believed that in order to make it easy for the broad masses to accept, it was necessary to explain from the perspective of life phenomena. However, if the Marriage Law is not publicized from a political and essential perspective, and if it does not emphasize the active role of the implementation of the Marriage Law in social reform, it is impossible for the broad masses to realize the great political significance of the Marriage Law, and it is impossible to educate the broad masses to consciously and actively rise up and fight against the feudal marriage system and the remnants of feudal ideology.
    Secondly, the popularization of national policies and laws is a very serious task, and a very serious and prudent attitude must be adopted. Even the explanation of a single word or sentence should be based on evidence, and no supplementary explanations can be made without authorization for the sake of being specific. Because the publishing house has no right to interpret the content of the law. Moreover, many provisions can only make principled regulations. If specific supplements are added, it will lead to omissions and not only fail to solve the problem but also cause confusion in the thinking of the masses.
    Thirdly, the leadership of the superiors, the concern and help of the branch and relevant departments are the main reasons why this book can have high quality and also the main reasons for confidence in compiling this manuscript.
    Finally, when compiling a popular reading, in addition to clearly recognizing the target audience of this reading, it is also necessary to clearly recognize the purpose of compiling this reading. Only in this way can a reading be suitable for the needs of a certain audience. It should be known that there is no shortcut in any work, and even if successful experience is used, it is necessary to use one's brains to study whether it is suitable for the specific situation and should make bold creations according to the specific situation.

    “婚姻法图解通俗本”的编写经验
    华东人民出版社
    我社出版的“婚姻法图解通俗本”，自一九五一年十一月出版以来，获得广大读者的欢迎。到一九五二年十一月为止，已印行了一千八百三十六万二千册。这除了说明广大读者对政治文化需要的迫切外，并说明这本书还是比较适合读者需要的。为了更好地改进我们今后的工作，特在此将编写这本书的经验作一个介绍。
      编写的情况
    一九五一年春，本社编印的“惩治反革命条例图解通俗本”受到了广大群众的热烈欢迎。很多读者要求我们把其他重要的政策法令也编印成图解通俗本。这时，恰逢婚姻法公布后的一周年，各地检查婚姻法公布后的婚姻问题，发现不贯彻婚姻法、不学习婚姻法的现象，还十分严重。于是在八月份，我们就正式决定编印“婚姻法图解通俗本”。
    最初，我们没有认真研究编写的方法，就完全依照编写“惩治反革命条例图解通俗本”的经验，把条例意义作简单扼要的说明，另作字义解释。在编写过程中，发觉这样的编写，势必变成了为解释条例而解释条例。惩治反革命条例多是具体的量刑标准，问题明确，用不着多作说明。但婚姻法的通俗化工作，一定要涉及思想认识问题。这是因为封建社会遗留下来的封建思想给予人们的影响，并不是随着封建的经济基础的消灭而一下子都消灭掉的。只有宣传婚姻法，同时又解除了群众中对婚姻问题不正确的思想认识，才能使群众在思想上划清新旧婚姻制度的界限，才能使婚姻法真正为群众所接受。但是经过这样改写以后，又显得重复囉囌，而且还不能解决群众中的思想认识问题和具体问题。如婚姻法第二条，就涉及婚姻法实行以前的重婚、纳妾如何处理，不生育是否可以再娶一个老婆，婚姻法实行前的童养媳如何处理，为什么要禁止干涉寡妇的结婚自由，寡妇改嫁时孩子和财产如何处理，为什么禁止借婚姻关系问题索取财物等。这些问题如仅按照条例作通俗解释，是不能解释清楚的。因此，最后才确定了该稿的编写方法：除对条例作词句上的通俗解释外，凡涉及思想认识问题，都标出小题目作重点解释；一些具体的问题，则根据有关的文件作解释。
    初稿在八月二十日完成，先交时事政治通俗科的同志提供意见，又经领导上审查修改，然后将原稿油印，送请华东有关部门审查；并寄人民出版社数份，除请他们审查外，并由他们转请中央有关部门审查。同时，由本社美术编辑部第一科组织上海美协的同志配图。从十月八日起，先将该稿的图画部分在解放日报连续刊载，征求读者意见。
    华东有关部门的意见在九月底收齐，中央有关部门的意见在十月底收齐。他们都提供了许多极宝贵的意见。其中特别重要的，是指出本稿应着重从社会政治意义上进行宣传。根据这个指示，我们加写了一篇前记，说明贯彻婚姻法的重大政治意义。对其他原先着重从生活现象来说明的地方，则重加补充改写，着重从政治上、本质上来解释。如讲解为什么要废除封建婚姻制度，原来的解释中没有指出封建婚姻制度与整个封建社会制度的密切联系，而只孤立地从夫妻关系、婆媳关系去讲解，因此就不可能把婚姻法的基本精神讲解明白。又经过了修改，本书的政治思想内容，是大大地加强了。
    最后把清样送请中共中央华东局宣传部及人民出版社批准，于一九五一年十一月十九日付印。
    本书的影响
    “婚姻法图解通俗本”到一九五二年十一月为止，印行了一千八百三十六万二千册。根据不完全的统计，全国各地有十四个报纸、刊物转载；好几处妇联及宣传部门来信要求我们允许他们把图解复制成大张的宣传画；很多群众把复制的图文，张贴在工厂、里弄、街道、商店橱窗中；不少地方妇联、青年团支部、工会、民校把本书当作教材，组织学习讨论。
    根据已经搜集到的群众反映，这本书已深入到了群众中间，并已在当前人民政治生活中，起了一定的作用。特别是受封建婚姻迫害最重的妇女，对该书表现了高度的热爱。据福建闽侯潘墩乡文教委员董应珍说，妇女购买这本书的数字占该乡销出书的数字的百分之七十以上。她们以摸鱼、种菜所得来的钱付书款。妇女郭赛英买得这本书后，请人为他讲解，听得忘了做饭。她说：“婚姻是我们的大事，不可让我一知半解。”妇女王桂花说：“过去我们妇女在旧婚姻制度下难做人，今天有了婚姻法，有了撑腰人，这本书我饿肚子也要买一本。”
    很多乡村干部认为，这本书有条例，又有讲解，并用新旧婚姻的对比来说明，真是谈得清楚深刻。不少宣传员、妇联干部反映，他们有了这本书，就有了有力的宣传婚姻法的材料了。一个老大娘听人讲解这本书时，竟哭泣起来。原来她有两个女儿在不合理的封建制度下牺牲了生命。她说：“这本书讲得真对，真有道理，以后我再也不敢包办儿女的婚事了。我还要买一本帮助宣传。”
    这本书帮助群众解决了婚姻问题。许多青年男女，在学习了这本书后，突破了封建家庭束缚，公开宣布自己正当的恋爱，废除了不合理的婚约；父母离婚后的子女得到了应得的抚育；早婚的恶习得到了纠正；把婚姻法当成离婚法的错误思想也得到了批驳。
    几点体会
    在编写过程中，我们还获得了一些体会。首先，编写通俗读物，应注意从本质上、政治上来作解释；只有这样，才能使读物具有强烈的政治思想内容。在编写这本书的初期，错误地认为要使广大群众易于接受，就必须多从生活现象出发来解释。但是，宣传婚姻法如果不从政治上、本质上来解释，如果不着重说明婚姻法的实行对社会改革所起的积极作用，就不能使广大群众认识到婚姻法的重大政治意义，也就不能教育广大群众自觉地、积极地起来和封建婚姻制度及封建残余思想做斗争。
    其次，国家政策法令的通俗化工作，是一件十分严肃的工作，必须采取十分严肃审慎的态度。那怕是一字一句的说明，都应该有所根据，绝不能因要求具体而擅自做补充说明。因为出版社无权解释法律的内容。而且许多条文也只能作原则性的规定，如加以具体的补充，反倒挂一漏万，不但不能解决问题，反倒会造成群众思想的混乱。
    再次，上级的领导、支部和有关部门的关心和帮助，是使这本书所以能有较高质量的主要原因，也是使编写此稿具有信心的主要原因。
    最后，在编写一本通俗读物时，除了要明确认识这本读物的读者对象外，同时要明确认识编写这本读物的目的。只有这样，才有可能使一本读物适合一定读者的需要。要知道，任何工作都没有捷径，即使运用成功的经验，也必须开动脑筋，研究是否适合具体情况，并应根据具体情况作大胆的创造。
