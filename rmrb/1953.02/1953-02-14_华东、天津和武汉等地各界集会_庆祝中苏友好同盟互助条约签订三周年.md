The East China Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and the Shanghai Sino-Soviet Friendship Association held a celebration meeting on the evening of February 12 to celebrate the third anniversary of signing the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Aid. More than 2,000 representatives from people's organizations and democratic parties in East China and Shanghai attended the celebration. Soviet Consul General in Shanghai, Shchetili, Vice Consul Velikiy Khazhin, Soviet experts who are helping China with construction in East China and Shanghai, as well as the head of the Hungarian People's Republic Exhibition preparation in Shanghai, Heide Ni, and Hungarian experts were also invited to attend.

Chen Yi, President of the Shanghai Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, delivered the opening speech at the celebration meeting. He said that the development of the international situation and the increasing consolidation of Sino-Soviet friendship in the past three years have proved that the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Aid has made a great contribution to the cause of world peace. In the three years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, great achievements have been made in various tasks, and these achievements are inseparable from the assistance of the Soviet people. We must follow Chairman Mao's instructions and strive for the further consolidation and development of the Sino-Soviet alliance. Shu Tong, Vice President of the East China Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, explained in detail and vividly with specific examples that the Soviet Union's assistance to our country is selfless. He said that when celebrating the third anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Aid, we must learn from the Soviet Union, especially the experience of Soviet economic construction and national defense construction. We must carry out the movement of learning from the Soviet Union with specific content in various work positions, and strive to complete and overfulfill the 1953 national construction plan.

Shchetili was invited to speak. He said: The three years after the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Aid demonstrated the great strength of the Sino-Soviet alliance in consolidating the cause of world peace. This force is a serious obstacle to the attempt of American imperialism and other imperialists to realize their aggressive plans. He said that the Soviet people are welcoming the news of the Chinese people's progress towards the road of building a new life with joy and excitement. The Soviet people sincerely hope that the great friendship between the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union will be further consolidated and developed. At this time, the audience stood up and cheered "Stalin - Mao Zedong" for several minutes. The congress finally passed a congratulatory telegram to Chairman Stalin.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, February 13th – More than 300 representatives from all walks of life in Tianjin gathered at 2 pm on the 12th to warmly celebrate the third anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Aid. Huang Huoqing, Vice President of the Tianjin Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, spoke. He said: The people of Tianjin have a deep understanding of the Soviet Union's fraternal and selfless assistance to China's construction. In the past three years, the Soviet Union has sent many outstanding experts with rich experience to help us. They have unreservedly imparted their advanced experience to us in various construction positions, and have made very outstanding contributions in all aspects of construction. Soviet expert Marishev put forward more than 90 suggestions for improving equipment and operation in the Tianjin Steel Plant. This is one of the main reasons why the output of Tianjin Steel Plant in 1952 was nearly 30 times higher than in 1949. Soviet expert Zadorozhny worked in the Tianjin Railway Bureau for several days and nights and put forward 22 improvement suggestions, which played a great role in improving the work of the bureau. He went on to say: In the past three years, the friendly cooperation between the Chinese and Soviet peoples has developed rapidly. Through various publicity activities, the Tianjin Sino-Soviet Friendship Association has continuously improved its members' understanding of the significance of Sino-Soviet friendship and the prospects of socialism. In the past three years, the number of members in the city has reached 830,000, an increase of 11 times compared with 1949. The city has published 200,000 copies of various books publicizing the Soviet Union and 1 million copies of newspapers. The total number of people participating in large-scale publicity activities directly organized is nearly 3 million. About 33,000 people in the city are studying Russian in their spare time or have registered to study Russian. He concluded: Today, on the occasion of celebrating the third anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Aid, we must respond to Chairman Mao's call to learn from the Soviet Union with practical actions, and strive to launch a climax of learning from the Soviet Union in the city.
