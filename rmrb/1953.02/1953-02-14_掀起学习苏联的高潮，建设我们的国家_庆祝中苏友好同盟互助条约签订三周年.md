	Launch a High Tide of Learning from the Soviet Union and Build Our Country
	—Celebrating the Third Anniversary of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance
	The great Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance, signed in Moscow on February 14, 1950, marks its third anniversary today. The enormous role this treaty has played over the past three years fully demonstrates that the strength of the solidarity between the Chinese and Soviet people, encompassing 700 million people, is invincible.
	The facts of the past three years prove that the strength of this great fraternal alliance is a decisive guarantee for peace in the Far East and the world, a tremendous inspiration to all oppressed nations and all peace-loving people around the world, and a fatal blow to the war policies of the imperialist aggressive bloc. People remember that the imperialist center of aggression, Washington, felt great unease the day after the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance was signed. Senator Ferguson, a Republican from the United States, stated, "This alliance severely undermines our position in Asia. The announced treaty will have an effect throughout the Far East." However, the invincible power of the unbreakable solidarity between our Chinese and Soviet peoples, which has already emerged and will continue to emerge, is far beyond what the imperialists can estimate.
	In the past three years of practical experience, the Chinese people have deeply recognized that the profound friendship of the great Soviet people, under the leadership of Comrade Stalin and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, towards our people is beyond words. Comrade Mao Zedong rightly said in his speech on February 17, 1950, when he left Moscow: "The full understanding and deep friendship established on the basis of the fundamental interests of the Chinese and Soviet peoples is beyond words. People can see that the unity of the Chinese and Soviet peoples, which has already been fixed by treaty, will be permanent and indestructible. No one can separate it. And this unity will not only inevitably affect the prosperity of China and the Soviet Union, but will also inevitably affect the future of mankind, and affect the victory of peace and justice in the world." This is indeed the case. The great alliance between the Chinese and Soviet peoples has changed and will continue to change the balance of power between the imperialist aggressive camp and the peaceful democratic camp. It has greatly limited and disrupted the imperialist aggression plans in the past three years, and in the future, as the strength of China and the Soviet Union continues to grow rapidly, it will surely play a greater role in the cause of world peace.
	In the process of our country's economic recovery, countless facts have proven that Soviet aid is of paramount importance to us. Everyone knows that after the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance, the Soviet government provided loans to our country on preferential terms, and a large number of Soviet experts were invited to our country to help us quickly repair railways such as the Jinghan and Yuehan Railways, quickly build railways such as the Chengyu and Tianlan Railways, quickly complete the first phase of the Huai River harnessing project and the Jingjiang flood diversion and other water conservancy projects, quickly complete the construction of the Tanggu New Port, quickly eradicate the plague in Inner Mongolia and other places, and introduce various advanced Soviet experiences to us without reservation, which has led to a series of reforms in production technology and business management in many industrial sectors in our country, and achieved great results. With selfless labor and self-sacrificing spirit, Soviet comrades have motivated and cultivated a large number of activists and labor models in our working class, creating favorable conditions for our country's large-scale five-year plan construction in the future.
	The Soviet government's gratuitous transfer to our country on December 31, 1952, of all rights to jointly manage the China Changchun Railway and all property belonging to this railway is a new and vivid proof of the great friendship of the Soviet Union to our country. In his speech at the signing ceremony of the final protocol for this transfer, Comrade Zhou Enlai said: "The Chinese people will never forget this brotherly friendship and assistance from the Soviet people… This completely new type of brotherly cooperation between our two countries is undoubtedly a brilliant example unparalleled in the history of international diplomacy."
	The facts of economic cooperation and mutual assistance between the Soviet Union and our country vividly demonstrate what Comrade Stalin pointed out in "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR": "The experience of this cooperation shows that no capitalist country can give the people's democracies real and technically proficient assistance as the Soviet Union does. The issue is not only that this assistance is extremely cheap and technically first-rate. The issue is primarily that the basis of this cooperation is a sincere desire for mutual assistance and the achievement of common economic uplift. As a result, there has been a high rate of industrial development in these countries." The Chinese people should especially thank Comrade Stalin and thank the Soviet Union, because we have only received completely first-rate and technically proficient friendship and assistance from the Soviet Union. This is unprecedented in the entire history experienced by the Chinese people. During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, people saw the so-called "aid to China" from the United States, which was entirely to satisfy the greed of American monopoly capitalists to exploit the Chinese people. The imperialists and the Kuomintang reactionaries did their best to destroy China's industry, so that when China was liberated, our industrial base was still very pitiful. Only after liberation did we have the opportunity to quickly restore the national economy, and starting this year, we have been able to struggle according to plan and step by step for the industrialization of our country.
	In order to realize the industrialization of our country, the most important thing before us is to learn from the Soviet Union. Comrade Mao Zedong called on us at the Fourth Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference:
	"We must learn from the Soviet Union. We are going to carry out great national construction, the work before us is arduous, and our experience is insufficient. Therefore, we must earnestly learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. Whether inside or outside the Communist Party, old or new cadres, technicians, intellectuals, as well as workers and peasants, we must sincerely learn from the Soviet Union. We must not only study the theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, but also study the advanced science and technology of the Soviet Union. We must launch a high tide of learning from the Soviet Union throughout the country to build our country."
	This call from Comrade Mao Zedong is of great importance to the construction of our country's five-year plan, which is now beginning. We should quickly launch a systematic movement to learn from the Soviet Union throughout the country. We must understand that in order to guarantee the victory of our country's construction work, on the one hand, there is the sincere and selfless assistance of the Soviet Union, and on the other hand, there is our sincere learning from the Soviet Union, and these two aspects are indispensable. The latter aspect is even more important than the former. Because the construction of our country is, after all, our own business. No matter how much the Soviet Union helps us, if we ourselves do not strive to learn various knowledge in the construction undertaking, so as to do our work well, then our construction plan will never be realized automatically.
	To learn from the Soviet Union, this is affirmed, so we must learn humbly, learn with determination, and overcome any difficulties in learning. Our people's revolution was successful by learning from the Soviet Union. Since the difficulties of the past have been overcome, the difficulties of the future will of course be easier to overcome. The Chinese people are good at learning, which is one of our excellent historical traditions. Comrade Mao Zedong, in "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship," traced the experience of our people in modern times in learning from foreign countries: "Since the failure of the Opium War in 1840, advanced Chinese, through untold hardships, have sought truth from Western countries. Hong Xiuquan, Kang Youwei, Yan Fu, and Sun Yat-sen represented a group of figures who sought truth from the West before the birth of the Communist Party of China. At that time, progressive Chinese read any book as long as it contained new ideas from the West. The number of students sent to Japan, Britain, the United States, France, and Germany reached an astonishing level. The imperial examination system was abolished and schools were established throughout the country like bamboo shoots after a spring rain, striving to learn from the West." But this learning never graduated, because "the teachers always invaded the students," and the students' situation became more and more miserable. This continued until 1917 when "the salvo of the October Revolution brought us Marxism-Leninism. The October Revolution helped advanced elements all over the world, including China, to use the proletarian world outlook as a tool to observe the destiny of the country and to reconsider their own problems. Taking the road of the Russians—this is the conclusion." This conclusion is a historical conclusion. Guided by this historical conclusion, our people resolutely took the road of the Russians, which made the face of the Chinese revolution take on a completely new look. We drove away those "teachers"—the imperialists—who always invaded us, won the victory of the revolution, and established a people's democratic country. We found a true teacher and friend in adversity—the Soviet Union. It is a country that has eliminated class exploitation and is building communism, so it is sincere and selfless. Its radiance illuminates our path forward, and illuminates the future of all mankind. In this way, how can we not strive to learn from the Soviet Union, and what difficulties can stop us!
	In the three years since the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance, we have learned a lot of advanced experience from the Soviet Union, and our country has been progressing at an unprecedented speed. In the future, as long as we follow Comrade Mao Zedong's call, launch a high tide of learning from the Soviet Union throughout the country, and sincerely learn more revolutionary theories from the Soviet Union, learn all advanced science and technology, we will surely be able to victoriously complete the plan for national construction and steadily move towards the lofty goals of socialism and communism.

    掀起学习苏联的高潮，建设我们的国家
    ——庆祝中苏友好同盟互助条约签订三周年
    伟大的中苏友好同盟互助条约，于一九五零年二月十四日在莫斯科签订之后，到今天三周年了。这个条约在这三年间所已经发生的巨大作用，充分地显示了包括七万万人口的中苏两国人民团结的力量是不可战胜的。
    三年的事实证明，这个伟大的兄弟同盟的力量，对于远东和世界的和平是一个决定性的保障，对于全世界被压迫民族和一切爱好和平的人民是一个极大的鼓舞，对于帝国主义的侵略集团的战争政策是一个致命的打击。人们记得，在中苏友好同盟互助条约签订的第二天，帝国主义侵略中心的华盛顿就感到了极大的不安。美国共和党参议员福开森就发表谈话说：“这个同盟严重地打击了我们在亚洲的地位。已公布的条约在全远东都会发生效力。”但是，我们中苏两国人民牢不可破的团结所已经发生并将继续发生的无敌的力量，还远远不是帝国主义者所能够估计得到的。
    中国人民在三年的实际体验中，深深地认识了伟大的苏联人民，在斯大林同志和苏联共产党的领导下，对于我国人民的深厚友谊是难以用言语来形容的。毛泽东同志在一九五零年二月十七日离开莫斯科时的演说说得对：“在中苏两大国人民根本利益的基础上所建立起来的充分了解与深厚友谊，是难以用言语来形容的。人们可以看得见：业已经过条约固定下来的中苏两大国人民的团结将是永久的、不可破坏的。没有人能够分离的。而这种团结，不但必然要影响中苏两大国的繁荣，而且必然要影响到人类的将来，影响到全世界和平与正义的胜利。”事实正是这样。中苏两大国人民的伟大同盟，已经改变了并将继续改变帝国主义侵略阵营和和平民主阵营的力量的对比。它已经在过去三年中大大限制了和破坏了帝国主义的侵略计划，而在今后，随着中苏两国力量的继续迅速增长，必将对世界和平事业发挥更伟大的作用。
    在我国经济恢复的过程中，无数的事实都已经证明，苏联的援助对我们具有头等的重要性。人人都知道，在中苏友好同盟互助条约签订之后，苏联政府就以优惠条件贷款给我国，大批的苏联专家应邀来到我国，帮助我们迅速修复了京汉、粤汉等铁路，迅速建成了成渝、天兰等铁路，迅速完成了第一期治淮的工程和荆江分洪等水利工程，迅速完成了塘沽新港的建设工程，迅速扑灭了内蒙古等地的鼠疫，并将苏联的各种先进经验无保留地介绍给我们，引起了我国许多企业部门在生产技术和经营管理方面的一系列的改革，获得了很大的成绩。苏联的同志们以忘我的劳动和自我牺牲的精神，带动和培养了我国工人阶级的大批积极分子和不少的劳动模范，为我国今后大规模的五年计划的建设创造了良好的条件。
    苏联政府在一九五二年十二月三十一日将共同管理中国长春铁路的一切权利和属于这条铁路的全部财产无偿地移交给我国，是苏联对我国伟大友谊的新的生动的证明。周恩来同志在这一移交的最后议定书签署仪式上的讲话中说：“中国人民对苏联人民这一兄弟般的友谊援助将永志不忘。……我们两国之间的这种完全新型的兄弟般的合作关系，毫无疑义地是国际外交史上无可比拟的光辉榜样。”
    苏联和我国在经济上的合作互助的事实，生动地证明了斯大林同志在“苏联社会主义经济问题”中所指出的：“这个合作的经验表明，没有一个资本主义国家能像苏联那样给予各人民民主国家以真正的帮助和技术精湛的帮助。问题不仅在于这种帮助是极度便宜的，技术上是头等的。问题首先在于这种合作的基础，是互相帮助和求得共同经济高涨的真诚愿望。结果，在这些国家中便有了高速度的工业发展。”我国人民应该特别感谢斯大林同志，感谢苏联，因为我们只有从苏联才得到了完全头等的、技术精湛的友谊援助。这在中国人民所经历的全部历史中是空前未有的。在国民党反动统治时期的中国，人们曾看到美国的所谓“对华援助”，那完全是为了满足美国垄断资本家剥削中国人民的贪欲。帝国主义和国民党反动派极力摧残中国的工业，以致在中国解放的时候，我们的工业基础还非常可怜。仅仅在解放以后，我们才有可能迅速恢复了国民经济，并且从今年开始能够按计划地、有步骤地为我们国家的工业化而奋斗。
    为了实现我国的工业化，摆在我们面前的头等重要的事情，就是向苏联学习。毛泽东同志在中国人民政协第一届全国委员会第四次会议上号召我们：
    “要学习苏联。我们要进行伟大的国家建设，我们面前的工作是艰苦的，我们的经验是不够的，因此，要认真学习苏联的先进经验。无论共产党内、共产党外、老干部、新干部、技术人员、知识分子以及工人群众和农民群众，都必须诚心诚意地向苏联学习。我们不仅要学习马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的理论，而且要学习苏联先进的科学技术。我们要在全国范围内掀起学习苏联的高潮，来建设我们的国家。”
    毛泽东同志的这个号召，对于我国正在开始的五年计划的建设，具有极大的重要性。我们应该在全国范围内迅速展开有系统地学习苏联的运动。我们必须懂得：为了保证我们国家建设工作的胜利，一方面是苏联对我们真诚无私的援助，一方面是我们向苏联诚心诚意的学习，这两方面是缺一不可的。而后一方面比前一方面更为重要。因为我们国家的建设毕竟是我们自己的事情，无论苏联怎样援助，如果我们自己不努力学会建设事业中的各项知识，从而把我们的工作作好，那末，我们的建设计划总是不会自动实现的。
    要学习苏联，这是肯定了的，因此就必须虚心地学、决心地学，要克服学习中的任何困难。我国人民的革命，就是学习苏联才成功了的，过去的困难既然克服了，今后的困难当然就更加容易克服。中国人民是善于学习的，这是我们优良的历史传统之一。毛泽东同志在“论人民民主专政”中追溯我国人民近代学习外国的经验时说：“自从一八四○年鸦片战争失败那时起，先进的中国人，经过千辛万苦，向西方国家寻找真理。洪秀全、康有为、严复和孙中山，代表了在中国共产党出世以前向西方寻找真理的一派人物。那时，求进步的中国人，只要是西方的新道理，什么书也看。向日本、英国、美国、法国、德国派遣留学生之多，达到了惊人的程度。国内废科举，兴学校，好像雨后春笋，努力学习西方。”但是这个学习老是不能毕业，因为“先生老是侵略学生”，学生的情形愈来愈悲惨了。这样一直到了一九一七年，“十月革命一声炮响，给我们送来了马克思列宁主义。十月革命帮助了全世界的也帮助了中国的先进分子，用无产阶级的宇宙观作为观察国家命运的工具，重新考虑自己的问题。走俄国人的路——这就是结论。”这个结论是历史的结论。我国人民以这个历史的结论为指导，坚决地走俄国人的路，才使中国革命的面貌焕然一新。我们把那些老是侵略我们的“先生”——帝国主义赶跑了，取得了革命的胜利，建立了人民民主的国家。我们从患难中找到了真正的先生和朋友——苏联。它是已经消灭了阶级剥削、正在建设共产主义的国家，因此，它是真诚无私的。它的光辉照亮着我们前进的道路，照亮着全人类的未来。这样，我们又怎么能够不努力学习苏联，又有什么困难能够阻挡我们呢！
    中苏友好同盟互助条约签订的三年来，我们已经从苏联学到了不少先进的经验，我们的国家已经以空前的速度在进步着。今后只要我们依照毛泽东同志的号召，在全国范围内掀起学习苏联的高潮，诚心诚意地向苏联学习更多的革命理论，学习一切先进的科学技术，我们就一定能够胜利地完成国家建设的计划，稳步地向着社会主义和共产主义的远大的理想目标前进。
