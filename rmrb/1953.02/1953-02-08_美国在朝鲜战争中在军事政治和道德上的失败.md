The Korean People's Army, fighting closely alongside the fraternal Chinese People's Volunteer Army for the independence of the motherland and world peace, welcomes the fifth anniversary of its founding with victories in military, political, and moral terms.

The entire course of our three-year Fatherland Liberation War shows that the U.S. imperialist plan to colonize Korea and turn it into a Far East military base for aggression against China and the Soviet Union has been shattered. It has suffered heavy blows in military, political, and moral terms.

On June 25, 1950, U.S. imperialism, according to a pre-determined plan, directed the Syngman Rhee puppet army (hereinafter referred to as the Rhee puppet army) to suddenly attack the democratic base of our motherland, the area north of the "38th Parallel."

However, the young Korean People's Army, after being suddenly attacked by the Rhee puppet army, did not panic or hesitate, but annihilated the enemy invading the area north of the "38th Parallel" on the spot, and launched a counterattack with doubled strength, liberating Seoul on the third day, and reaching the distant South Sea and the banks of the Nakdong River in just two months.

The U.S. Army, Navy, and Air Force, which were hurriedly transferred to the Korean front due to the failure and collapse of the Rhee puppet army, not only failed to stop our army, but even the U.S. 24th Division, which the enemy boasted about, was annihilated in the Daejeon area, and the division commander was captured.

After the U.S. military was compressed into a small area east of the Nakdong River, U.S. imperialism投入了100,000 troops and gathered 30,000-40,000 remaining soldiers of the Rhee Syngman army to conduct desperate resistance. They faced the serious danger of being driven from the Nakdong River bridgehead into the sea.

Therefore, U.S. imperialism mobilized all the technically and numerically superior forces that it and its vassal states could投入 into the Korean War, and carried out the Incheon Landing Operation.

As a result, the military situation changed, and there was a significant difference in the balance of power between the enemy and us. The Korean People's Army made correct plans for this and carried out a strategic retreat. U.S. imperialism drove its own and its vassal states' mercenaries to frantically attack north of the "38th Parallel." The enemy's ground forces even temporarily ventured to the banks of the Yalu River and Changjin Lake.

Our motherland encountered a serious crisis, and the Chinese border was directly threatened. Under this situation, the great Chinese people could not ignore the threat to their own country's independence and security, nor could they stand idly by in the dangerous situation of the Korean people, who had close ties with them in history and had formed a fraternal friendship with them in a long struggle against a common enemy. Shouting the slogan of "Resist America, Aid Korea," they sent their outstanding sons and daughters—the Volunteer Army—to the Korean front.

The participation of the fraternal Chinese People's Volunteer Army (hereinafter referred to as the Volunteer Army) strengthened the confidence and combat effectiveness of the Korean People's Army. The joint operations of the Korean People's Army and the Volunteer Army became a great force that the aggressors could not resist. This transformed the military situation. Due to our powerful blows, the enemy left many corpses on the banks of the Cheongcheon River and Changjin Lake, and then retreated south of the "38th Parallel." U.S. imperialism had to turn to defensive warfare.

After that, U.S. imperialism invested a large number of troops and military equipment on a narrow front, and frantically launched large-scale so-called "Summer Offensive" and "Autumn Offensive," but each time it suffered heavy blows. Its adventurous schemes were thwarted, and up to now, the front line has been fixed near the "38th Parallel."

Thus, from the sudden attack launched by U.S. imperialism against our Democratic People's Republic of Korea on June 25, 1950, all the large-scale adventurous offensives that followed, in which it recklessly used its soldiers' blood, were declared a failure due to the heavy blows suffered by our young People's Army and the powerful Volunteer Army.

U.S. imperialism and its accomplices have lost more than one million troops and consumed a large amount of military equipment and war expenses from the beginning of the war to the present.

After U.S. imperialism's repeated adventurous offensives suffered failures, it is conducting defensive warfare in the place where they started the war of aggression, at the cost of such huge losses.

It can be seen from this that U.S. imperialism has suffered obvious military failures.

The military adventures of U.S. imperialism in the Korean War have repeatedly suffered failures, and its military strength has been significantly weakened.

U.S. imperialism has suffered huge losses in manpower and material resources in the past war.

Not only that, but its losses are gradually increasing from small to large. From December 1951 to May 1952, the average number of enemies we annihilated per month was 9,029. This number gradually increased, and by October 1952, it had increased to 63,841. That is to say, the enemy's losses in one month in October 1952 exceeded the total losses of the enemy in the half year from December 1951.

Related to this are the frequent changes of U.S. military generals, the loss of many generals and colonels, including thousands of combat pilots, and the overall low morale of U.S. soldiers, all of which show the weakening of U.S. imperialist military strength in the Korean War.

The weakening of U.S. imperialist military strength in the Korean War can also be seen from the decline in its combat quality. From October 14 to the end of November 1952, in the so-called "Kimhwa Offensive," Van Fleet投入了 the 7th U.S. Division and the 2nd and 9th puppet divisions, a total of three divisions, against two highlands covering only three square kilometers guarded by only two companies of Volunteer Army warriors. In addition, more than 100 tanks and the U.S. Eighth Army's artillery general reserve team, which are not normally used, were mobilized, with an average of 63 sorties of aircraft per day, sometimes up to more than 250 sorties per day.

In this way, with four to five battalions attacking 20 to 30 times a day, an average of more than 24,000 shells were fired every day, with a maximum of nearly 300,000 shells. U.S. imperialism wanted to compensate for the decline in quality with quantity.

The weakening of U.S. imperialist military strength in the Korean War can also be seen from its deceptive slogan and plan of "using Asians to fight Asians." In order to implement this plan, the traitor Syngman Rhee accepted U.S. dollars and frantically sold South Korean youths to U.S. imperialism as cannon fodder. U.S. imperialism is forcibly conscripting and training South Korean youths, and has begun to replace U.S. troops on the front lines with Rhee puppet troops, and is planning to bring as many Japanese bandits and Chiang Kai-shek's remnants to the Korean front as possible. This shows U.S. imperialism's consistent trick of "using other people's hands" and "enriching oneself"; it also shows the U.S. imperialist's sinister conspiracy to replace the U.S. troops near the "38th Parallel" for new adventures; and it also shows that the reserve force of U.S. imperialism in the Korean War has almost dried up. If it does not use the Rhee puppet army, Japanese bandits, and Chiang Kai-shek's remnants to supplement it, the U.S. military cannot attempt any new adventures and it is difficult to continue the war in Korea.

In the Fatherland Liberation War, the Korean People's Army and the Volunteer Army shattered the enemy's attempts, causing huge losses to the enemy's forces and military equipment. At the same time, they have continuously grown and strengthened their own forces. The Korean People's Army is no longer the Korean People's Army of June 25, 1950. The Korean People's Army has become a more modernized and powerful army in terms of quantity, quality, and technology in the solemn flames of the Fatherland Liberation War.

At the same time, the Volunteer Army has also been further tempered in the just war, has become more organized and equipped, and is more proficient in modern warfare. In the battle, we have grown and strengthened our own strength in this way, while U.S. imperialism has gradually weakened its military strength.

From this, it can also be seen that U.S. imperialism has suffered obvious military failures.

In the Korean War, U.S. imperialism also suffered failures in military art.

All the facts in the war prove that the U.S. imperialist strategic plan, which overestimates its own strength and underestimates the strength of the other party, is dangerous for itself.

All the facts in the war prove that American generals are stupid guys. In unforeseen situations and unfavorable conditions, the commanders of U.S. imperialism are completely incompetent.

All the facts in the war also prove the unreality of the U.S. imperialist clamor that so-called "technological superiority" determines the fate of the war and the strategy and tactics of relying the entire fate of the war on so-called "technological superiority."

The Korean People's Army and the fraternal Volunteer Army not only defeated the so-called "technological superiority" of U.S. imperialism with their outstanding tactics and noble moral spirit, and exposed the falsehood of their propaganda that a technological advantage determines the fate of the war, but also gradually defeated and surpassed the enemy's "technological superiority" with their own technology. This has caused undisguised depression among American generals.

Why? This is because the American generals clearly know that American soldiers cannot fight without the cover of airplanes and tanks; if an element of technological superiority is deprived, everything is over.

From the failure in military art, U.S. imperialism has also suffered obvious military failures.

The military failure of U.S. imperialism can also be seen from the fact that the robbers themselves now openly refuse to adopt the plan of quick victory.

Two years and eight months ago, when U.S. imperialism drove the Rhee puppet army to attack the area north of the "38th Parallel," Syngman Rhee, a U.S. imperialist lackey, clamored that the "Northward Expedition" would be completed in three days, and bluffed that they would eat lunch in Pyongyang and dinner in Wonsan. But the world knows that the Korean People's Army liberated Seoul in three days, and the Syngman Rhee traitorous gang collapsed like a gambling den. In October 1950, MacArthur drove his soldiers to attack north of the Cheongcheon River, boasting that the Korean War would be over before Christmas; but MacArthur himself fled the Korean front before Christmas. American soldiers also died in large numbers on the Korean front in 1952 Christmas for the profits of American billionaires.

Today, American generals even boast about maintaining the "38th Parallel."

U.S. imperialism's having to accept the great Soviet Union's proposal to start Korean armistice negotiations, as well as talking about its "limited offensive," also shows that the robbers have fallen into an unexpected abyss.

All the above facts show that the military failure of U.S. imperialism in the Korean War is conclusive; and in front of the people of the world, it exposes that the United States is not as powerful as the robbers themselves have advertised, but rather a "paper tiger." The "myth" about the strength of the U.S. military has also been exposed and trampled on the Korean front under the steel-like feet of the heroic Korean People's Army and the great Chinese people's sons and daughters—the Volunteer Army warriors.

General Kim Il-sung, the respected leader of the Korean people, said: "The truth that the U.S. military is carrying out armed intervention in Korea under the banner of the United Nations, and that the U.S. vassal states are participating in this intervention under its compulsion, is being revealed. This is a serious political failure for the U.S. imperialists."

U.S. imperialism attempted to conceal its aggressive truth under the banner of the United Nations and to isolate the Korean people with the banner of the United Nations. However, the Korean War proved that the U.S. imperialists' dream of "the Korean people invading Korea" did not convince the just people of the world; they cannot isolate the people who are fighting for their freedom and independence with any deception and trickery.

The era when imperialist robbers arbitrarily invaded other countries and enslaved other people is over.

In the just Fatherland Liberation War, the fraternal solidarity of our country with the great Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other people's democratic countries has been further consolidated. The Korean people, who are fighting for the freedom and independence of their motherland, have received the support and sympathy of the peace-loving people all over the world.

U.S. imperialism launched the Korean War, originally intending to defeat the young Korean People's Army in one fell swoop, thinking that they could easily conquer the Korean people by threatening them with airplanes, warships, cannons, and atomic bombs.

In this way, U.S. imperialism mobilized the so-called "United Nations Army" of nineteen countries to the Korean front, launching various crazy offensives from the ground, air, and sea.

However, the Korean War proved that the people who rely on the strength of the world's democratic camp, led by the great Soviet Union and the great People's Republic of China, and who are fighting to defend their freedom and independence with its fraternal assistance, cannot be subdued by any threats and disasters.

The Korean People's Army was not only not defeated, but further strengthened its own strength, giving a fatal blow to U.S. imperialism and its vassals. The Korean people were not only not subdued, but further united around the Korean Workers' Party, the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and the respected leader General Kim Il-sung, each step further consolidating their confidence in victory, and resolutely fighting the enemy with doubled hatred and enmity.

On the contrary, U.S. imperialism, due to its criminal acts in Korea, aroused the hatred and condemnation of the people all over the world, and its internal contradictions have become more acute.

Now the robbers' "alliance" is a method of concealing contradictions, but the U.S. imperialist order to its vassal states to send more troops to the Korean front has not been obediently implemented, and "disrespectful attitudes" of the vassal states towards their masters have gradually begun to appear in the United Nations.

The internal situation in the United States itself is no better than this. The failure of U.S. imperialism in the Korean War, and the increasingly heavy burden of various forms of war imposed on the American people, have aroused the dissatisfaction and new awareness of the American people, and have gradually further led the American people to the conclusion that the only way out of the war is to end the war and the determination to fight for peace.

The center of world reaction, the world's gendarme—U.S. imperialism, when instigating the Korean War,妄想 to suppress the revolutionary Korean people, and then turn Korea into a base for them to intimidate the oppressed people of the East, deprive them of their achieved results, and extinguish their liberation movements.

However, the atrocities of U.S. imperialism in the Korean War first aroused the hatred of the people under U.S. imperialist occupation and other oppressed people. The Korean people's struggle for the freedom and independence of their motherland has formed the banner of the national liberation movement of the oppressed people.

In this way, U.S. imperialism has suffered unexpected results not only in military terms, but also in political terms.

U.S. imperialism calls itself the "world leader," the "defender of freedom and civilization," and promotes and forces people to accept the so-called "American way of life."

However, the Korean War exposed the various masks of U.S. imperialism and thoroughly revealed its hypocrisy and deception. U.S. imperialists are reactionaries far exceeding Hitler and Tojo, butchers, robbers, and beasts wearing human masks. Various facts in the war process prove these.

In the twenty-one days from July 11 to 31, 1952, American aerial bandits dropped more than 18,000 various bombs such as napalm bombs, mine bombs, fragmentation bombs, and time bombs on the cities of Pyongyang, Wonsan, and Chongjin alone.

Most of the enemy planes appearing in the Korean airspace are attacking peaceful cities and rural areas that have no military targets, and are slaughtering peaceful residents.

The American butcher Clark肆行 committed such atrocities, and publicly clamored last August that he would carry out destructive destruction from the air on 78 cities in our country.

In fact, our cities and larger rural areas had already been completely destroyed by American aerial bandits before Clark made his clamor.

Clark's clamors only meant mass slaughter of peaceful residents who lived in the rubble of destroyed buildings and lived in the earthen caves on the ruins.

More than 400 enemy planes indiscriminately carried out the most inhumane bombing and machine gun strafing since the war on the destroyed city of Pyongyang and its surrounding areas on July 11 and 12, 1952, before dawn, resulting in the destruction of more than 1,600 earthen caves of peaceful residents and the slaughter of more than 6,000 women, old people, and children.

U.S. imperialism wantonly destroyed the valuable facilities such as power plants, factories, schools, and hospitals built by the labor of our people, and barbarously burned the precious historical relics created by our ancestors with blood and sweat and talent.

The crimes of U.S. imperialism are not only these. In order to save its disastrous defeat and exterminate the Korean people and massacre the Chinese people, U.S. imperialism even used poison gas bombs and bacteriological weapons.

Hating humanity is the dominant ideology of U.S. imperialism. Slaughtering the Korean people and the Asian people is the plan of U.S. imperialism.

During the period of temporary occupation by U.S. imperialism in 1950, it massively massacred the residents of the northern half, and in Sinchon County, which has a population of only 100,000, it massacred 35,000 men, women, old people, and children.

Now, they are killing our captured personnel on Geoje Island, Jeju Island, and Bongam Island every day, using them for experiments with chemical and bacteriological weapons.

However, these atrocities of U.S. imperialism cannot discourage the Korean people and cannot thwart their unyielding fighting spirit. The various atrocities of U.S. imperialism can only make the moral spirit of the Korean people more high-spirited.

On the contrary, the advocates and practitioners of hating humanity—U.S. imperialism—not only made themselves ugly beasts, but also morally degraded the majority of young people in the United States and its vassal states.

The U.S. imperialists, wearing human masks, have become enemies of mankind in this way, arousing the anger and condemnation of the people all over the world. U.S. imperialism also suffered a failure in morality in the Korean War.

The moral spirit of the army comes from the soldiers' confidence in the justice of the war and the legitimacy of their work. Comrade Stalin, in the period of the Soviet Patriotic War, compared the mental state of the Red Army and the German army and said: "The morale of our army is higher than that of the German army, because our army is defending the motherland against foreign invaders and believes that its cause is just; while the German army is carrying out a war of aggression and plundering other people's countries, and cannot believe that its despicable deeds are just even for a minute."

U.S. imperialism cannot expect the noble moral spirit of its own army at all. Therefore, U.S. imperialism "educates" and encourages its soldiers with the despicable actions of hating humanity and betrayal, robbery, atrocities, greed, and depraved enjoyment of other nations and races; obviously, such an army cannot be loved and trusted by the people. The U.S. military has not only become an object of hatred for the Korean people and the friends of the Korean people, but also is unpopular among its "allies" and lackeys. The British army originally fought in mixed operations with the U.S. military, but due to the contradictions between the U.S. military, the British Commonwealth Division was organized to carry out its mission independently after the Fifth Campaign. In addition, not only do the puppet soldiers resent the U.S. military and American advisors, but there are also deep contradictions between the U.S. military officers, American advisors, and puppet military officers. These contradictions and the aggressive acts of U.S. imperialism have gradually made some of the Rhee puppet military officers and soldiers realize who their real enemy is, and are fueling their rebellious sentiment.

The U.S. military, which cannot have a noble moral spirit, cannot but become a cowardly army. The American generals drive the armies of other countries to deal with the most dangerous situations on the Korean front, but let the American army take the lead in the flight. Although the total number of enemy losses and the absolute number of U.S. military losses are gradually increasing, the fact that the proportion of U.S. military losses in the total number of enemy losses is gradually decreasing also shows the above situation.

In the half year from December 1951 to May 1952, the loss ratio of the U.S. military in the average total loss number of the enemy each month was 46.9%, but it decreased every month, reaching 38.9% in October 1952. The bravery of American generals and officers is only "bravery" against women, unarmed residents, and the captured personnel detained in their prisoner-of-war camps.

An army without noble moral qualities will have extremely low morale when it encounters difficult situations. The morale of the U.S. military and its lackeys, who are trapped in the quagmire from which they cannot extricate themselves on the Korean battlefield, has been extremely low. Therefore, Van Fleet and Syngman Rhee even staged a comedy in which their wives were dispatched to the east and west lines to cheer up the low morale of the front-line soldiers in order to restore the low morale of the front-line military personnel. At the same time, U.S. imperialism created the so-called "point system" in order to change the military's desire to go home. That is to say, let the soldiers who have obtained 36 points return home (outpost duty is 4 points, front-line squadron duty is 3 points, duty in the rear area 50 kilometers from the front line is 2 points, and other general duty is 1 point). U.S. imperialism uses this method to deceive its own soldiers who do not want to fight but only want to go home alive, and to make them do the more points of outpost duty and front-line squadron duty, which in fact is to lure them to walk towards the graveyard.

The soldiers of the Korean People's Army and the fraternal Volunteer Army believe that the war they are waging is a just war, and they believe in the legitimacy of their cause, so they have a noble moral spirit, and their morale is getting higher and higher as they fight. The young Korean People's Army is called the heroic army by the people all over the world; the fraternal Volunteer Army is not only respected and loved by the Korean people but also by the people all over the world as a just army. At the same time, the friendship and unity forged in blood between the soldiers of the Korean People's Army and the Volunteer Army are as solid as steel.

All these facts mean the failure of the ideology of hating humanity and selfishness based on the "American way of life," and at the same time show that we have also won in moral terms.

The military, political, and moral failures suffered by U.S. imperialism in the Korean War are by no means accidental.

So, what is the basis for this? That is:

First, it is the miscalculation of the U.S. imperialists. General Kim Il-sung, the respected leader of the Korean people, pointed out regarding the miscalculation of U.S. imperialism: "First, they did not estimate the infinite will and determination of the Korean people to defend their freedom and independence; second, they did not estimate the selfless fraternal assistance of socialism and the people's democratic countries; third, they did not estimate the new form of proletarian internationalist assistance when the fraternal Chinese people extended a helping hand to the Korean people in a difficult and dangerous period and sent their volunteer army to Korea."

Second, U.S. imperialism has lost its political and moral foundation.

Comrade Stalin predicted the inevitable failure of German imperialism and its army in World War II, saying: "In its moral degradation, the German aggressor has long lost humanity and has fallen to the level of beasts—this situation alone also shows that they have plunged themselves into inevitable destruction."

Today, the same can be said for U.S. imperialism, which far exceeds the beastly Hitler in the Korean War.

The war being waged by U.S. imperialism is a war of aggression, that is, an unjust war.

Comrade Stalin said about the Korean War: "It is also difficult to make the soldiers believe that the United States has the right to defend the security of the United States in the territory of Korea and on the border of China, while China and Korea do not have the right to defend their security in their own territory and on their own borders. Therefore, this war is unpopular among American and British soldiers.

It is very clear that if the soldiers believe that the war they are being forced to wage is extremely unjust, if the soldiers therefore only perform their duties formally on the front lines, neither believing that their mission is just nor having enthusiasm, then even the most experienced generals and officers will fail."

Third, it is the internal fragility of U.S. imperialism.

After World War II, U.S. imperialism became the advocate, organizer, and head of various aggressive "alliances" and "groups."

However, due to the intensification of contradictions between its allies, these "alliances" and "groups" cannot but be regarded as pavilions in the desert that will collapse at a gust of wind. U.S. imperialism has forcibly occupied South Korea, Taiwan, the Philippines, Japan, West Germany, etc., attempting to turn them into bases for dominating the world. However, these "bases" cannot but be regarded as volcanoes on the eve of the eruption that will frighten U.S. imperialism.

U.S. imperialism is forcing the people of other countries and the young people of its own country to bleed in the Korean War in order to further fill the money bags of American billionaires, make its own people more impoverished, and establish a fascist system in all aspects of domestic life; therefore, it cannot but be believed that U.S. imperialists are a "paper tiger."

Fourth, it is the weakness of U.S. imperialism in strategy and tactics.

U.S. imperialism fully exposed this weakness in the Korean War.

The shameful military, political, and moral failures suffered by U.S. imperialism in the Korean War are very clear and by no means accidental.

However, U.S. imperialism does not accept the lessons of the harsh reality whip, does not want to admit its failure, and is now frantically planning new adventures.

However, as General Kim Il-sung, the respected leader of the Korean people, said: "There is no doubt that their new attempts are destined to go bankrupt in the same way, and will again end with the disgrace of their organizers and advocates."

If the U.S. imperialists do not abandon their intention to invade our motherland, then, as the liberator, teacher, and closest friend of the Korean people—the great Comrade Stalin—said: "The Korean War can only end with the failure of the interventionists."

    美国在朝鲜战争中在军事政治和道德上的失败
    朝鲜人民军总参谋长  南日
    为祖国独立和世界和平而与兄弟般的中国人民志愿军部队紧密地并肩作战的朝鲜人民军，以在军事、政治和道德上的胜利，迎接着自己的建军五周年。
    我们祖国解放战争三年来的全部过程表明，美帝国主义企图把朝鲜殖民地化、并变它为侵略中国和苏联的远东军事基地的计划已被粉碎。它已在军事、政治和道德上遭到沉重的打击。
    一九五○年六月二十五日，美帝国主义依照预定计划，指使李承晚伪军（以下简称李伪军）突然进攻我们祖国的民主基地“三八”线以北地区。
    但是年青的朝鲜人民军在受到李伪军的突然攻击后，却毫不慌张、毫不踌躇地把侵入“三八”线以北地区的敌人就地消灭，并以加倍的力量展开了反击战，在第三天就解放了汉城，在不过两个月的期间就到达了辽远的南海和洛东江边。
    因李伪军的失败和崩溃而被忙乱地直接调到朝鲜战线的美国陆海空军，不但不能挡住我军，而且连敌人自夸的美二十四师也在大田一带被歼灭，师长被俘掳。
    在美军被压缩到洛东江以东的狭小地区以后，美帝国主义投入十万兵力，并聚集三、四万李承晚残兵进行了拼命的抵抗。他们曾面临着从洛东江桥头堡上被赶到海里的严重危险。
    因此，美帝国主义便动员了自己和它的仆从国家可以投入朝鲜战线的在技术和数量上占优势的全部兵力，举行了仁川登陆作战。
    由此军事情势起了变动，敌我力量的对比发生了显著的差别，朝鲜人民军对此作了正确的策划，进行了战略撤退。美帝国主义驱使着自己及其仆从国的雇佣兵疯狂地向“三八线”以北进攻。敌人的地面部队甚至暂时冒险地到达了鸭绿江边和长津湖畔。
    我们祖国遇到了严重的危机，中国国境直接受到了威胁。在这种情势下，伟大的中国人民对于对自己祖国的独立和安全的威胁，不能置之不理，对在历史上和自己关系密切、而且在为反对共同敌人而长久斗争中和自己结成了兄弟般的友谊的朝鲜人民的危险处境，也不能袖手旁观。他们高喊着“抗美援朝”的口号，把自己的优秀儿女——志愿军部队派到朝鲜战线。
    兄弟般的中国人民志愿军（以下简称志愿军）的参战，加强了朝鲜人民军的信心和战斗力。朝鲜人民军和志愿军的并肩作战，成为侵略者无法抵御的伟大力量。这样就转变了军事形势。敌人由于我们的强有力的打击，在清川江边和长津湖畔丢下很多尸体，接着又败退到“三八”线以南去了。美帝国主义不得不转而进行防御战。
    其后，美帝国主义在狭小的战线上投入了大量的兵力和军事装备，疯狂地大规模地发动了所谓“夏季攻势”、“秋季攻势”，但是每次都受到了沉重的打击。它的冒险图谋被挫败了，到现在为止战线
    一直固定在“三八”线附近。
    这样，美帝国主义从一九五○年六月二十五日对我们朝鲜民主主义人民共和国开始进行突然进攻时起，毫不珍惜自己士兵们的血而疯狂地接连进行的大规模的冒险进攻，都因遭受我们年青的人民军和强大的志愿军的沉重打击而宣告失败。
    美帝国主义及其帮凶从战争开始到现在损失了一百万以上的兵力，消耗了大量的军事装备和战争费用。
    美帝国主义在反复进行的冒险进攻遭受失败以后，就以这样的巨大损失作代价，在他们开始发动侵略战争的地方进行着防御战。
    由此可见，美帝国主义遭受了明显的军事失败。
    美帝国主义在朝鲜战争中的军事冒险每一次都连续遭受失败，它的军事力量显著地削弱了。
    美帝国主义在过去的战争过程中，遭到了巨大的人力物力的损失。
    不但如此，它的损失并逐渐在由小到大。一九五一年十二月到一九五二年五月，我们歼敌数字每月平均是九、○二九名，这个数字逐渐向上增加着，到一九五二年十月，就增加到六三、八四一名，就是说敌人在一九五二年十月一个月的损失，超过了敌人从一九五一年十二月起的半年中的损失的总数。
    与此有关的是美军将领的频繁更换，包括数千名战斗飞行员在内的很多将校的损失，美军士兵全面的士气低落等，也都说明了美帝国主义军事力量在朝鲜战争中的削弱。
    美帝国主义在朝鲜战争中军事力量的削弱，也可从它的战斗质量的低落上看出来。一九五二年十月十四日至十一月底，在所谓“金化攻势”中，范佛里特对只不过两个连的志愿军勇士们守卫着的三平方公里的两个高地，投入了美第七师和伪军第二师、第九师等三个师的兵力，此外还动员了一百多辆坦克和一般情况下不使用的美第八军的炮兵总预备队，平均每天出动六十三架次飞机，有时一天出动到二百五十多架次。
    这样，以四个至五个营的兵力每天进攻二十次到三十次，每天平均发射炮弹二万四千多发，最高达到将近三十万发。美帝国主义想这样地以数量来弥补质量的低落。
    美帝国主义在朝鲜战争中军事力量的削弱，从其所谓“用亚洲人打亚洲人”的欺骗口号和计划中也可以看出。为了实行这个计划，卖国贼李承晚接受了美元，在疯狂地把南朝鲜青年卖给美帝国主义作炮灰。美帝国主义强制征募和训练着南朝鲜青年，已开始用李伪军替换在前线的美军部队，并策划着要尽可能把更多的日本强盗和蒋介石残兵拉到朝鲜战线。这表现了美帝国主义“借人之手”、“中饱私囊”的一贯伎俩；也说明了美帝国主义企图把“三八”线附近的美军撤换下来作新的冒险的凶恶阴谋；这并且表明在朝鲜战争中美帝国主义后备力量已差不多枯竭了，如果不用李伪军、日本强盗和蒋介石残兵来补充，美军就无法试图进行任何新的冒险，难于在朝鲜继续进行战争。
    在祖国解放战争中，朝鲜人民军和志愿军粉碎了敌人的企图，使敌人的有生力量和军事装备遭受巨大损失。同时已使自己的力量不断地成长壮大了。朝鲜人民军已经不是一九五○年六月二十五日的朝鲜人民军了。朝鲜人民军在庄严的祖国解放战争火焰里，数量、质量和技术上都已成为更加现代化的强大军队了。
    同时，志愿军也在正义的战争过程中得到进一步的锻炼，组织、装备得更健全，并对现代化的战斗更加熟练了。在战斗中我们使自己的力量如此地成长壮大，而美帝国主义却使自己的军事力量渐渐衰弱了。
    由此也可见美帝国主义遭受了明显的军事失败。
    在朝鲜战争中美帝国主义在军事艺术方面也遭到了失败。
    战争过程中的一切事实都证明，美帝国主义过高估计自己力量、过低估计对方力量的战略计划，而这对他们自己是危险的。
    战争过程中的一切事实证明美国将军们是些愚蠢的家伙。在不能预料到的情况和不利的条件下，美帝国主义的指挥官们是完全无能的。
    战争过程中的一切事实同时也证明了，美帝国主义叫嚣着的所谓“技术优势”决定战争命运，把战争的整个命运依靠所谓“技术优势”的战略战术的非现实性。
    朝鲜人民军和兄弟般的志愿军不但用自己卓越的战术和高尚的道德精神，打垮了美帝国主义的所谓“技术优势”，揭穿了他们以一个技术优势决定战争命运的宣传的科学根据的虚伪性，而且也在逐渐以自己的技术打垮和胜过敌人的“技术优势”。这使美国将军们产生了不可掩饰的苦闷。
    为什么呢？这是因为美国将军清楚地知道：美国士兵们没有飞机和坦克的掩护，就不能打仗；如果一个技术优势的要素被剥夺了的话，一切就都完了。
    从军事艺术方面的失败看来，美帝国主义也遭受了明显的军事失败。
    美帝国主义在军事上的失败，从强盗们自己现在也公开拒绝采用速战速决计划的事实中，也可以看出。
    两年又八个月以前，当美帝国主义驱令李伪军向“三八”线以北地区进攻时，美帝国主义的走狗李承晚曾叫嚣着三天完成“北伐”，虚张声势地说：在平壤吃午饭，在元山吃晚饭。但是举世皆知，朝鲜人民军三天工夫解放了汉城，李承晚卖国匪帮像赌博场似地崩溃了。一九五○年十月麦克阿瑟曾驱使自己的士兵向清川江以北进攻，吹嘘说在圣诞节前结束朝鲜战争；但是圣诞节前麦克阿瑟自己却从朝鲜战线逃跑了。美国士兵们在一九五二年的圣诞节，也在朝鲜战线为美国亿万富翁们的利润而大批死亡。
    到了今天，美国将军们甚至还为维持着“三八”线而夸耀。
    美帝国主义的不得已接受了伟大的苏联关于开始朝鲜停战谈判的提议，以及大谈其“有限攻势”等，也说明强盗们已陷入意料之外的深渊。
    以上的一切事实，都表明美帝国主义在朝鲜战争中的军事上的失败，是确凿的；并在全世界人民面前，暴露了美国不但不像强盗们自己所宣传的那样强大，相反的，美国只不过是一个“纸老虎”。关于美军强大的“神话”，也已在朝鲜战线被戳穿、被践踏在英雄的朝鲜人民军和伟大的中国人民的子弟——志愿军勇士们的钢铁似的脚底下了。
    朝鲜人民的敬爱领袖金日成将军说：“美军在联合国的旗帜下，在朝鲜进行武装干涉，和美国的仆从国家在它的强迫之下参加着这个干涉的真相的被揭穿，这就是美帝国主义者在政治上的严重失败。”
    美帝国主义企图在联合国的旗帜下，掩饰其侵略真相，用联合国的旗帜来孤立朝鲜人民。但是朝鲜战争证实，美帝国主义者的“朝鲜人民侵略朝鲜”的梦呓，没有使世界公正的人们相信；他们用任何欺骗和戏弄，也孤立不了为自己的自由和独立而战斗的人民。
    帝国主义强盗们任意侵略别国奴役别国人民的时代，已经过去了。
    在正义的祖国解放战争过程中，我国和伟大的苏联、中华人民共和国及其他人民民主国家的兄弟般的团结，已进一步巩固。为自己祖国的自由独立而斗争的朝鲜人民，获得了全世界爱好和平人民的支持和同情。
    美帝国主义发动侵朝战争，本来打算一举击溃年青的朝鲜人民军，以为用飞机舰炮和原子弹威胁朝鲜人民，就可以轻易地把朝鲜人民征服。
    这样，美帝国主义动员了十九个国家的所谓“联合国军”，到朝鲜战线，从地面、空中和海上，进行各种疯狂进攻。
    但是，朝鲜战争证实了依靠以伟大苏联和伟大的中华人民共和国为首的世界民主阵营的力量，受着它的兄弟般的援助，而为捍卫自己的自由独立而战斗的人民，是任何威胁和灾难所不能屈服的。
    朝鲜人民军不但没有被打垮，反而进一步加强着自己的力量，给了美帝国主义及其仆从们致命的打击。朝鲜人民不但没有被屈服，反而进一步团结在朝鲜劳动党、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府和敬爱的领袖金日成将军的周围，每进一步都更加巩固着胜利信心，怀着加倍的憎恶和敌忾挺身和敌人决战。
    与此相反，美帝国主义由于它在朝鲜的犯罪行为，激起了全世界人民的憎恶和斥责，它内部的矛盾已更加尖锐化。
    现在强盗们的“同盟”是掩蔽矛盾的方法，但是美帝国主义叫其仆从国家往朝鲜战线派遣更多军队的命令，并没有被驯服地实行，联合国中渐渐开始出现着仆从国家对其主子的“不逊的态度”。
    美国本身的内部情况，也不比这种情况好些。美帝国主义在朝鲜战争中的失败，和强加在美国人民群众头上的越来越重的各种形式的战争负担，激起了美国人民的不满和新的觉悟，并渐渐地进一步地引导着美国人民倾向于战争的唯一出路是结束战争的结论和为和平而战斗的决心。
    世界反动的中心、世界的宪兵——美帝国主义，在挑拨朝鲜战争时，妄想镇压革命的朝鲜人民，然后把朝鲜变为它们恫吓东方被压迫人民，剥夺他们已取得的成果，和扑灭他们解放运动的据点。
    但是，美帝国主义在朝鲜战争中的暴行，首先引起了在美帝国主义强占下的人民和其他被压迫人民的憎恶。朝鲜人民为祖国的自由和独立的斗争，形成了被压迫人民民族解放运动的旗帜。
    就这样，美帝国主义不仅在军事方面，而且也在政治方面，遭到了意料之外的结果。
    美帝国主义自称为“世界的领导者”、“自由和文明的拥护者”，并宣传和强迫人接受所谓“美国生活方式”。
    但是，朝鲜战争揭穿了美帝国主义的各种假面具，并彻底地揭露了它的虚伪和欺骗行为。美帝国主义者是远超过希特勒和东条的反动派，是屠夫，是强盗，是戴上人类面具的野兽。战争过程中发生的各种事实证明着这一些。
    从一九五二年七月十一日到三十一日的二十一天中，美国空中强盗仅对平壤、元山和清津市，就投下了一万八千多颗凝固汽油弹、地雷弹、破裂弹和定时弹等各种炸弹。
    出现在朝鲜领空的敌机，大部分是袭击没有任何军事目标的和平城市和农村的，是屠杀和平居民的。
    美国屠夫克拉克肆行了这样的暴行，并曾在去年八月公开叫嚣说要对我国七十八个城市从空中加以毁灭性的破坏。
    其实，我们的城市和较大的农村，在克拉克发出叫嚣以前，业已被美国空中强盗完全破坏了。
    克拉克这些叫嚣，只是意味着大量屠杀那些生活在被破坏了的建筑物瓦砾中和生活在废墟上的土窟中的和平居民。
    敌机四百多架在一九五二年七月十一日到十二日，天没有亮，就对已被破坏了的平壤市及其周围一带，滥施了战争以来最惨无人道的轰炸和机枪扫射，结果有一千六百多所和平居民的土窟被毁，有六千多名的妇女、老人和儿童被屠杀。
    美帝国主义肆无忌惮地炸毁了由我们人民的劳动建设起来的发电所、工厂、学校、病院等宝贵设施，野蛮地烧毁了我们祖先用血汗和才能造成的珍贵的历史遗物等。
    美帝国主义的罪行，不仅仅是这些。美帝国主义为了挽回它的惨败，灭绝朝鲜人民，虐杀中国人民，甚至于还使用着毒气弹和细菌武器。
    憎恶人类是美帝国主义的支配思想。屠杀朝鲜人民和亚洲人民是美帝国主义的计划。
    美帝国主义在一九五○年暂时强占时期，大量地屠杀了北半部的居民，仅在只有十万人口的信川郡，就屠杀了男女老少三万五千人。
    现在，它们在巨济岛、济州岛和蜂岩岛，每天屠杀着我方被俘人员，利用他们作化学武器和细菌武器的试验。
    但是，美帝国主义的这种种暴行，是不能使朝鲜人民灰心，是不能挫折他们的不屈不挠的斗志的。美帝国主义的各种暴行，只能使朝鲜人民的道德精神更加昂扬。
    与此相反，憎恶人类的鼓吹者和实践者——美帝国主义，不仅使自己成为丑恶的野兽，而且使美国及其仆从国家的多数青年在道德上堕落。
    戴着人类面具的美帝国主义者，就这样地成了人类的敌人，引起了全世界人民的愤怒和斥责。美帝国主义在朝鲜战争中，在道德上也遭到了失败。
    军队的道德精神，是由军人对于战争的正义性质和自己工作的正当性的信心而来的。伟大的斯大林同志在苏联卫国战争时期，把红军和德军的精神状态作对比说：“我国军队底士气比德国军队的高，因为我军是在捍卫祖国反对外寇，并且相信自己的事业是正义的；而德国军队则是进行侵略战争和掠夺别人国家，甚至一分钟也不能相信自己的卑劣事情是正义的。”
    美帝国主义是丝毫不能期待自己军队的高尚的道德精神的。所以，美帝国主义以憎恶人类的思想和对其他民族与人种的背义、抢劫、暴行、贪欲和堕落的享乐等卑鄙的行动，来“教育”和鼓舞着自己的士兵；显然，这样的军队是不能受到人民的爱护和信赖的。美国军队不仅成了朝鲜人民和朝鲜人民的朋友们的憎恶对象，而且在它的“同盟军”和走狗中也不得人心。英国军队原来是与美军混合作战的，但由于和美军之间的矛盾，从第五次战役以后，才组织英联邦一师来独立执行任务。此外，不但伪军士兵们怨恨美军和美国顾问们，而且连美军军官美国顾问和伪军军官们之间也都存在着深刻的矛盾。这些矛盾和美帝国主义的侵略行为，使一部分李伪军官兵也逐渐认识到谁是自己的真正敌人，助长着他们的起义情绪。
    不可能具有高尚道德精神的美国军队，不能不成为懦怯的军队。美国将军们在朝鲜战线驱使其他国家的军队应付最危险的场合，在逃窜时却让美国军队带头，敌人的总损失数字和美军损失的绝对数字，虽然都在逐渐增加，但是美军损失数字在敌人总损失数字中所占的比率，却在逐渐降低，这一事实也说明了上述的情况。
    从一九五一年十二月至一九五二年五月的半年中，美军在敌人每月平均的总损失数字中所占的损失比率是百分之四十六点九，但每月都在降低，到一九五二年十月是百分之三十八点九。美国将军和军官们的勇敢，只不过是对妇女、空手的居民和被扣留在它们战俘营内的被俘人员的“勇敢”。
    没有高尚道德品质的军队，一碰到困难的情况，士气就要极其低落。在朝鲜战场上陷入无法自拔的泥坑里的美军及其走狗们的士气，已经极端低落了，因此范佛里特和李承晚甚至演出了为了要挽回前方军人的低落的士气而使自己的妻子出动到东、西线去打气的喜剧。同时，美帝国主义为了要转变军人
    一心想回家的念头而创造出所谓“点数制”，这就是说，让取得了三十六点的士兵回国（前哨勤务是四点，前线中队勤务是三点，离前线五十公里的后方地区的勤务是二点，其他一般勤务是一点）。美帝国主义就是以这种方法来欺骗不愿意打仗而只想活着回家的自己士兵们，使他们作点数多的前哨勤务和前线中队勤务，事实上是引诱他们向坟地走去。
    朝鲜人民军和兄弟般的志愿军将士们，认为自己进行着的战争是正义的战争，他们相信着自己事业的正当性，所以他们有着高尚的道德精神，他们的士气越战越高涨。年青的朝鲜人民军，被全世界人民称为英雄的军队；兄弟般的志愿军不仅被朝鲜人民而且被全世界人民当作正义的军队来加以尊敬和爱护。同时，朝鲜人民军将士和志愿军将士们，以血结成的友谊和团结，像钢铁一样地巩固了。
    这一切事实，都意味着根据“美国生活方式”的憎恶人类的思想和损人利己主义的失败，同时表明我们在道德方面也胜利了。
    美帝国主义在朝鲜战争中遭到了军事、政治和道德上的失败，决不是偶然的。
    那么，其根据是什么呢？那就是：
    一、是美帝国主义者的失算。朝鲜人民敬爱的领袖金日成将军，对于美帝国主义的失算曾指出：“第一、它们没有估计到朝鲜人民保卫自己的自由和独立的无限的意志和决心；第二、没有估计到社会主义和各人民民主国家无私的兄弟般的援助；第三、没有估计到在朝鲜人民处在艰难和危险的时期，兄弟般的中国人民向朝鲜人民伸出援助的手，把自己的志愿军派遣到朝鲜的无产阶级国际主义援助的新形态。”
    二、是美帝国主义丧失了政治—道德的基础。
    伟大的斯大林同志在第二次大战中预言德国帝国主义者及其军队的不可避免的失败说：“德国侵略者在其道德退化中，早已丧失了人性，降到了野兽地步，——单是这种情形也就说明，他们已使自己陷于必然灭亡的境地。”
    今天对于在朝鲜战争中远超过希特勒野兽的美帝国主义，同样地也可以这样说。
    美帝国主义进行着的战争，是侵略战争，即非正义的战争。
    斯大林同志关于朝鲜战争曾说：“要使士兵们相信：美国有权利在朝鲜领土上和中国边境上保卫美国的安全，而中国和朝鲜却没有权利在它们自己的领土上和它们自己的国境上保卫它们的安全，这也是很困难的。因此，这个战争在美英士兵中是不得人心的。
    这是很清楚的，如果士兵们认为强迫他们进行的战争是极端非正义的，如果士兵们因此而在前线上只是形式上执行职务，既不相信他们的使命合乎正义，也没有热情，那末就是最有经验的将领和军官也要失败的。”
    三、是美帝国主义的内部脆弱性。
    美帝国主义在第二次大战以后，成了各种侵略“同盟”和“集团”的提倡者、组织者和头目。
    但是，这些“同盟”和“集团”由于其同盟者相互之间矛盾的尖锐化，不能不看作是一刮风就要倒塌的沙漠上的楼阁。美帝国主义强占了南朝鲜、台湾、菲律宾、日本、西德等，企图变之为制霸世界的基地。但是，这些“基地”，不能不看作是必将吓倒美帝国主义的爆发前夜的火山。
    美帝国主义在朝鲜战争中，强使别国的人们和本国的青年们流血，来进一步装满美国亿万富翁们的钱袋，使本国人民更加零落，并在国内生活的各个方面建立了法西斯制度；因此不能不认为美帝国主义者是一只“纸老虎”。
    四、是美帝国主义的战略战术上的弱点。
    美帝国主义在朝鲜战争中完全暴露了这个弱点。
    美帝国主义在朝鲜战争中，在军事、政治和道德上遭到的可耻失败，很清楚，决不是偶然的。
    但是，美帝国主义不接受严峻的现实鞭子的教训，不想承认自己的失败，现在又疯狂地策划着新的冒险。
    但是，正如朝鲜人民的敬爱领袖金日成将军所说的一样：“毫无疑问，他们的新的企图，是同样地要破产的，并将要再以其组织者们和提倡者们的丢丑而告终。”
    如果美帝国主义者竟不放弃侵略我们祖国的意图，那么，必将像朝鲜人民的解放者、导师和最亲近的朋友—伟大的斯大林同志所说的那样：“朝鲜战争便只能以干涉者的失败而告终。”
