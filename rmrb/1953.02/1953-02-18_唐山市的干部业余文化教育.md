Tangshan City's Amateur Cultural Education for Cadres
I. Brief History, Overview, and Achievements

Since liberation, a large number of worker and peasant cadres have been transferred to Tangshan. These cadres have been tempered by revolutionary struggles to a certain extent, but their cultural level is low. After entering the city, they could not perform their work competently and often felt pessimistic and disappointed. In order to meet the needs of national construction, the Tangshan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, based on the instructions of the North China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party to establish cadre cultural supplementary schools, founded the city's cadre amateur cultural school in April 1949. At the beginning, there were 672 students and 16 teachers, with 4 part-time teachers. At that time, students were divided into three classes, A, B, and C, according to their cultural level, and no junior high school class was established. In early September 1949, the Municipal Committee decided to adopt a large-scale, regular, and long-term approach to running the school, and the number of students increased to 2,535. The number of schools increased to nine. In order to unify leadership, a general school headquarters was established in October. Since then, Tangshan's cadre amateur cultural education has advanced along the lines of "centralized schooling and long-term planning."

After that, the urban area and factories and mines gradually expanded, the number of cadres increased, and the amateur cultural schools also expanded accordingly. By last December, the schools had increased to 19 branch schools (including four suburban branch schools). A total of 8,189 cadres were enrolled, divided into 151 classes, including 68 junior high school classes and 83 primary school classes. There were 113 full-time faculty members and more than 90 part-time teachers (mostly current primary and secondary school teachers). In addition, there are plans to establish two senior high school experimental classes.

Tangshan City's amateur cultural school has gone through five semesters from its establishment to the present. In the first semester, five junior primary classes graduated in September 1949, with a total of 137 people. In the second semester, five senior primary classes graduated in April 1950, with a total of 160 people; eleven junior primary classes, with a total of 264 people. In the third semester, twelve senior primary classes graduated in February 1951, with a total of 294 people. In total, 17 senior primary classes graduated, with 454 students; 16 junior primary classes, with 404 students. Up to now, excluding those who entered middle school classes or dropped out midway, 1,755 people have improved from primary school to junior high school level; 1,050 people have improved from illiteracy or semi-illiteracy to senior primary school level. By the end of last year, one junior high school class graduated, with about 50 people; this summer, two junior high school classes will graduate, with about 80 students; by the end of this year, three junior high school classes will graduate, with about 160 students.

The cadres have gained a lot from participating in cultural studies. Those who were illiterate or knew very few characters before the start of school (April 1949) can now read newspapers and documents, write ordinary letters, work plans and work reports, and some can even write work summaries of three or four thousand words, and can basically use punctuation marks. Those who did not know Arabic numerals or only knew addition before the start of school have now learned the four arithmetic operations of integers and decimals, percentages, interest, and proportions, and can apply them to their work; a few have also learned algebra. Through geography studies, many people know the area, products, transportation, and natural conditions of the motherland, and further appreciate the loveliness of the motherland. Through the study of history, they have a preliminary understanding of the laws of social development, the deeds of revolutionary struggles of past generations, and the great creations and inventions of the working people, thus further understanding the greatness of the people of the motherland. Secondly, due to the improvement of the cadres' cultural level, their working ability and ideological level have also made significant progress. For example, Comrade Lin Zhuguo, director of the Tangshan Municipal Grain Depot directly under the city, could not take notes and only knew how to write Arabic numerals in arithmetic before entering the cadre amateur cultural school; after more than two years of study, he now has no worries about taking records, writing work plans, summaries, bookkeeping, and accounting. The grain depot has never had anyone write work summaries, but now there are summaries every month, and the work of the agency has also been significantly improved. Comrade Li Changlin, director of the health center, was an administrator when he first arrived in the city and did not even know Arabic numerals, but after more than two years in school, he now knows the four arithmetic operations of fractions and percentages and dares to write articles, so he is competent and happy in his work. Some cadres of the Huaxin Textile Factory are now participating in technical (business) studies, and they realize that learning mathematics is of great help to learning technology. Many cadres have greatly improved their confidence in their work due to the improvement of their culture and work ability, and they have also developed more in political thought. When they first entered the city, some pessimistic sentiments among the worker and peasant cadres, such as the argument that "worker and peasant cadres are no longer popular," were no longer heard.

Secondly, the amateur cultural school itself has also grown and developed, such as cultivating and improving dozens of cultural teachers (two-thirds of the teachers have improved in quality by one level compared to when they first came to the cadre amateur cultural school, that is, those who could originally teach junior primary and senior primary schools can now teach senior primary and junior high schools). It has accumulated and disseminated some experience in cadre amateur cultural schools; and has compiled some textbooks. For example, the school has successively compiled six volumes of arithmetic textbooks, three volumes of Chinese textbooks, and one volume of supplementary Chinese textbooks, which solved the difficulties in the teaching work of cadre amateur cultural schools, especially the arithmetic textbook ("Arithmetic Textbook for Staff") has been adopted by cadre schools throughout Hebei Province.

II. School System, Curriculum, Study Time, and Class Arrangement

School System: From October 1951 to the present, a six-year system has been adopted. The first three years are equivalent to ordinary complete primary school, and the last three years are equivalent to ordinary junior high school. The Municipal Committee stipulates that all cadres whose cultural level is not sufficient for junior high school graduation must participate in cultural studies.

Curriculum: The primary school part (i.e., the first three years) only studies Chinese and arithmetic. The junior high school part (the last three years) studies six subjects: Chinese, algebra, geometry, geography, history, physics, and chemistry.

In order to enable students to concentrate on their studies, the curriculum adopts simultaneous progress with fewer subjects (now it is planned to conduct single-subject studies), with no more than two subjects at the same time each week (excluding political classes).

Study Time: The six years are divided into twelve semesters, with eighteen weeks of classes each semester. There are four days of classes each week, with two classes each day for a total of ninety minutes. In addition to four days of cultural classes each week, there are also two days to study current affairs and politics (sometimes the Municipal Committee organizes large classes, but now most agencies organize their own studies). In order to adapt to the cadres' working hours, classes are divided into morning classes (early in the morning) and evening classes (after dinner), which are selected by the cadres participating in the study.

Class Arrangement: The cultural level of cadres and staff is very inconsistent, and the literary and scientific levels of the same person are often unbalanced. In addition, the study time is divided into morning and evening classes, so class arrangement has become an extremely complex and meticulous task, and it is also an extremely important link in whether cadres can study well. Tangshan City's cadre amateur cultural school has initially found the way to arrange classes through several years of exploration. That is to arrange various classes according to the specific circumstances of the students. Those with balanced literary and scientific levels are assigned to ordinary classes (regular classes), and those with unbalanced literary and scientific levels are assigned to mixed classes (the above two types of classes are the main classes). For a small number of people whose literary and scientific levels differ greatly, a cross-class system is adopted. And for those who still lack systematic knowledge in a certain subject, they can also only take a certain course. Sometimes single-subject classes are also opened, specifically for some people to improve a certain course, and then enable them to be assigned to ordinary classes.

Class Arrangement Method: When the cadre amateur cultural school was first established, class arrangement was based on the original cultural level and the class to which they intended to enter as filled in the enrollment form. However, the results of this arrangement often did not match the actual level of the students. Later, a test-based class arrangement method was tried, but because the answers could not completely match their actual level, the effect was not good. After several explorations, a trial listening class arrangement method is now adopted. That is, after the school and the students study together, they are introduced to a class of the same level for testing, and the class is determined within one or two weeks. In this way, the classes can be basically arranged within two weeks, and the requirements of the students are met (when too many students enroll at the same time, the individual understanding will be worse. Now we are studying the use of a combination of reference to the original cultural level and the class to be entered, examination and trial listening to conduct class arrangement).

Textbooks:

Chinese Textbooks: The primary school part adopts the "Language Textbook for Amateur Schools for机关 Cadres" Volumes 1 to 6 compiled by the Office of the Party Committee Directly Under the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. The junior high school part adopts the "Intermediate Chinese Textbook for Vocational Amateur Schools" Volumes 1 to 6 compiled by the Beijing Worker-Peasant Education Society. Arithmetic adopts the "Arithmetic Textbook for Staff" Volumes 1 to 6 compiled by this school. Algebra and geometry are based on the Northeast junior high school textbooks and are compiled by the school itself. Subjects such as geography, history, physics, and chemistry are based on the People's Publishing House junior high school textbooks and are streamlined for selective reading. Among them, geography and history are both taught and compiled. Students in the first and second grades of primary school (who are still illiterate, semi-illiterate, or close to non-illiterate) will all promote the rapid literacy method. The time saved after rapid literacy (saving about two semesters) will be appropriately increased in the junior high school part with courses in nature and health.

III. Organization and Leadership - Teaching Organization and Teaching System

Before August 1950, Tangshan City's cadre amateur cultural school was directly led by the Municipal Committee. After August 1950, it was led by the Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education. The general school headquarters has one principal and one vice-principal, concurrently held by the mayor and the director of the Bureau of Culture and Education, respectively, and a full-time dean of education. The general school headquarters has two sections (teaching affairs section, general affairs section) and one office (secretary's office). The branch schools are responsible for the cadre cultural studies in their respective regions. Each branch school has a director and a dean of education (or central teacher), teachers, and teaching affairs officers.

Teaching Organization and Teaching System: Because cadres study in their spare time, phenomena such as absenteeism, tardiness, and failure to submit assignments are prone to occur. These must be corrected and prevented in a timely manner. Now, in addition to the class teacher and class leader in each class, there is also an agency tutoring teacher, that is, the teachers are grouped into the agencies to tutor the students' studies. Students in the same agency also form agency groups to supervise each other and help with make-up classes. In addition, regulations on enrollment, transfer, withdrawal, and leave of absence, attendance and periodic sending of absence notices to various agencies for commendation and criticism, and examination regulations (monthly exams twice per semester, final exam once) have been formulated. Finally, at the end of the semester, grade reports are sent to various agencies, which are then forwarded to the students themselves through the agency party committee or branch. These systems play an important role. Since the establishment of the teaching organization and system, Tangshan City's cadre amateur cultural school has achieved great results, increasing the student attendance rate from 60% to 85%.

IV. Several Experiences

Over the past three years, there have been the following main experiences:

1. The leadership's attention is an extremely important condition. In this regard, the Tangshan Municipal Committee and the Municipal Government have done a good job. For example, when the cadre amateur cultural school was first established, the Municipal Committee clearly put forward the policy of "centralized schooling, long-term planning, special personnel responsible, fixed funding, steady progress, and meticulous teaching and learning," which gave the cadre amateur cultural school a direction to follow. The Municipal Committee reviewed the work plans and summaries of the cadre amateur cultural school every year, every quarter, and even every month and put forward opinions. The Propaganda Department of the Municipal Committee also carefully reviewed the compiled textbooks. Responsible comrades of the Municipal Committee and the Municipal Government often spoke at the opening or summary conferences of the cadre amateur cultural school. For example, Comrade Li Liguo, secretary of the Municipal Committee, instructed at the student enrollment resumption conference: "It is not responsible enough to the revolution if you do not work hard to learn culture." He also proposed:

"Responsible persons of agencies must ensure that work and study time do not infringe on each other." The party committees and administrative leaders of various agencies have come up with many ways to ensure cultural studies. For example, education committee members of various agency branches are responsible for promoting cadres' theoretical, cultural, and professional studies, and learning is one of the contents of branch life group reviews and agency appraisals. Administrative leaders take the initiative to resolve the contradiction between cadres' study time and work time. Some responsible comrades of agencies actively take the lead in participating in cultural studies, which has played a great role in promoting them. For example, Zhang Jianji, director of the winery, studied very well and was rated as a model student. Zhang Yisheng, president of the bank, studied humbly and diligently. Driven by them, all the comrades in the agency also studied very enthusiastically. Finally, the provincial and municipal leaders helped the cadre amateur cultural school solve the problems of teachers, funding, and necessary equipment.

2. It is necessary to adhere to the policy of regularization. Although cadre cultural studies are amateur, the policy of long-term planning, establishing a school system, and special personnel being responsible proposed by the Tangshan Municipal Committee is necessary. The purpose of running amateur cultural education is to fundamentally solve the problem of improving the culture of in-service cadres. At present, it is to enable cadres who do not yet have a junior high school graduation level to reach the junior high school graduation level, and in the future, we will try to improve it as much as possible. Secondly, having a definite school system and various levels of classes can enable cadres to gradually improve. Third, there are many convenient conditions in the city (such as concentration, convenient transportation, etc.), and unified leadership can be carried out under possible conditions, which is convenient for opening various classes and improving business. Fourth, there must be special personnel responsible for school affairs, hire enough full-time teachers, and have certain funding and equipment (such as office buildings, books, simple physical and chemical instruments, and wall charts, etc.).

3. It is necessary to correct the various wrong ideas of students, teachers, and school cadres in a timely manner. Some cadres lack confidence in learning and often use "old age and bad memory" as an excuse. Some regard learning as a "political treatment" and think that it is a "demotion" if they cannot participate in theoretical studies after learning culture, or feel "ashamed" to study with subordinates. Some think, "We are busy enough with work, how can we have time to study?" After starting to study, the following problems often occur: many people have the idea of aiming high "rather high than low" in class arrangement, but a few people want to save effort (or avoid theoretical studies) and have the idea of "rather low than high." Some also have an impetuous mood of eagerness to achieve success, and become discouraged when encountering difficulties. Some only care about listening to lectures and do not care about reviewing, and are unwilling to submit assignments. In teacher-student relations: some students look down on teachers, thinking that teachers' political level is too low, some question teachers face to face, and some deliberately find strange words from the dictionary to make it difficult for teachers. On the teacher's side, because they are mostly newly recruited intellectuals, they have many misconceptions about teaching in cadre amateur cultural schools, about students, and about teaching methods at the beginning. They are generally lack of confidence, afraid of teaching cadres, and say that cadres are not easy to "serve," "teach and try, if it fails, just leave." They dare not urge students who do not submit assignments; during exams, they pretend not to see students copying from books. Some look down on cadre amateur cultural schools and students, thinking that this kind of school is not formal after all, and it is better to teach in ordinary schools; they superficially fear and inwardly despise students, and when they hear opinions, they ridicule: "You have no culture, but you are picky!" Even individual teachers cover their noses with towels as soon as they enter the classroom, saying that the students are dirty. In addition, in teaching, they prefer to teach new cadres (mostly former students) rather than old cadres, thinking that old cadres are "stupid"; they always think more about those with some cultural foundation when compiling textbooks, arranging classes, and teaching classes. In addition, they generally have many bourgeois viewpoints in their thinking, and even some people still have the influence of reactionary thoughts. At the beginning, school staff often think that there are too many difficulties. In response to the ideological situation of different objects and different stages mentioned above, the leadership must constantly conduct ideological education to ensure teaching effectiveness. For example, it should be emphasized to students that cultural technology is not good in order to meet the tasks of economic construction. They are called upon to study culture seriously, respect teachers and study hard, and "put down their airs and be primary school students." It is emphasized that learning culture should progress steadily and insist on reviewing and homework, etc. Explain to the teachers the great significance of teaching cadres to learn culture, call on them to teach the lessons well, and take the initiative to approach and help the students. Pay attention to teachers' political study and ideological transformation, and absorb them to participate in cadres' political theory study. Help them in their work, and often approach and care for them in their daily lives. Explain to the school staff the great significance of running cadre cultural schools, and often help them solve difficulties.

4. Strengthen teaching research and combine with the characteristics of students to improve teaching quality.

Students are in-service cadres, basically adults, with a lot of work experience, strong comprehension, busy work, less study time, and they want to apply what they have learned. Therefore, teaching must grasp the principles of "less but refined" and the spirit of "rapid success." As far as the curriculum is concerned, it is not advisable to study many subjects at the same time ("simultaneous progress with multiple subjects"), at most two subjects at the same time. Focus on quality, not form. In terms of teaching progress, a linear upward method should be adopted, and overlaps should be avoided where subjects are connected (such as the overlap between junior high school arithmetic and primary school arithmetic), and repetitions should be avoided between units. In terms of teaching methods, we should link theory with practice and apply what we have learned. For example, after teaching students how to write letters in Chinese class, they should practice writing letters more. Teaching mathematics also emphasizes how to apply it in actual life and work.

Experience has proved that one of the most effective ways to improve teaching is to establish and strengthen teaching and research groups in each subject, and emphasize strengthening business learning and collective lesson preparation. This has played a great role in improving teachers' professional and ideological level, and in uniting teachers with teachers and teachers with students.

V. Existing Problems

There are still two problems in Tangshan City's cadre amateur cultural education: First, some cadres are too busy with work and often miss classes, and they fail to graduate on time every year (5% of the whole school cannot be promoted on time), and they urgently request to enter rapid middle school. Second, there is a lack of a set of cultural textbooks suitable for in-service cadres.

    唐山市的干部业余文化教育
    一、简史、概况、成绩
    唐山自解放后，调进了大批工农干部。这些干部经过一定的革命斗争的锻炼，但是文化水平低，进入城市以后，工作不能胜任，多感到悲观失望。中共唐山市委会为适应国家建设事业的需要，根据中共中央华北局建立干部文化补习学校的指示，于一九四九年四月创办了全市干部业余文化学校。开始时学员共六七二人、教员十六人，兼任教员四人。当时按学员文化程度分为甲乙丙三个班级，未设立初中班。一九四九年九月初，市委决定采取大规模的、正规化的、长期打算的办学方针，学员增加到二五三五人。学校增加到九处。为了统一领导，于十月间又成立了总校部。自此，唐山市干部业余文化教育就沿着“集中办学、长期打算”的方针迈进。
    此后，市区和厂矿逐渐扩大，干部增多，业余文化学校也随之日益扩大。到去年十二月已增加到十九个分校（包括四个郊区分校）。入学干部共八一八九人，分为一五一班；内初中六十八班，小学八十三班。专任教职员一一三人，兼任教员九十余人
    （多是现任中、小学教员）。此外，并计划设立高中实验班两班。
    唐山市业余文化学校从办学到现在已经过了五个学期。第一学期在一九四九年九月毕业了五个初小班，共一三七人。第二学期在一九五○年四月毕业了五个高小班，共一六○人；十一个初小班，共二六四人。第三学期在一九五一年二月毕业了十二个高小班，共二九四人。以上共计毕业高小十七个班，学员四五四人；初小十六个班，学员四○四人。截至目前为止，除中途入中学班和退学者外，由小学提高到初中程度的有一七五五人；由文盲、半文盲提高到高小程度的有一○五○人。到去年年底，有一个初中班毕业，约五○人；今年暑假将有两个初中班毕业，学员约八○人；到今年年底将有三个初中班毕业，学员约一六○人。
    干部在参加文化学习中收获是很大的。在开学前（一九四九年四月）不识字或识字很少的，现在都能阅读报纸、文件，能写普通书信、工作计划与工作报告，有的还能写三、四千字的工作总结，并基本上能运用标点符号。在开学前不识阿拉伯字码或仅会加法的，现在都学会了整数与小数四则、百分法、利息与比例，并能运用到工作上去；有少数还已学到代数。通过地理学习，许多人知道了祖国的面积、物产、交通和自然形势，进一步体会到祖国的可爱。通过历史学习，初步知道了社会发展规律、历代人民革命斗争的事迹以及劳动人民的伟大创造与发明，从而进一步了解到祖国人民的伟大。其次，由于干部文化水平的提高，他们的工作能力与思想水平也有了显著的进步。如唐山市直属粮库主任林柱国同志入干部业余文化学校前，不能作笔记，算术只会写阿拉伯字码；经过二年多的学习，现在作记录、写工作计划、总结、记帐、算帐都不发愁了。粮库一向没有人写工作总结，现在每月都有总结了，机关工作也得到显著提高。卫生事务所所长李长林同志，才进城时担任管理员，连阿拉伯字码也不会，但入校二年多，现在分数四则和百分法都会了，文章也敢作了，因而对工作也胜任愉快了。华新纺织厂的一些干部，现在都参加技术（业务）学习，他们体会到学了数学对学技术帮助很大。不少干部由于文化与工作能力的提高，大大地提高了工作信心，在政治思想上也开展多了。初进城时，在工农干部中一些悲观情绪如“工农干部吃不开了”的论调再也听不到说了。
    其次，业余文化学校本身也壮大发展了，如培养与提高了几十位文化教员（有三分之二的教员比才来干部业余文化学校时质量提高了一级，即原来能教初小、高小的现在能教高小、初中了。）积累与传播了干部业余文化学校的一些经验；并选编了一些教材。如：该校曾先后编出了六册算术课本、三册国文课本、一本语文补充教材，给干部业余文化学校教学工作解决了困难，尤其是算术课本（“工作人员算术课本”）已为河北全省干校采用。
    二、学制、课程、学习时间、编班
    学制：自一九五一年十月到现在，都是采取六年制。前三年相当于普通完小，后三年相当于普通初中。市委规定凡文化水平不够初中毕业的干部都要参加文化学习。
    课程：小学部分（即前三年）只学语文、算术两科。初中部分（后三年）学语文、代数、几何、地理、历史、理化等六科。
    为了使学员集中精力学习，课程采用少头并进（现拟单科进行），每周同时不超过两门（除政治课外）。
    学习时间：六年中分为十二个学期，每学期上课十八周，每周有四天上课，每天上课两节共九十分钟。每周除上四天文化课外，尚有两天时间学习时事政治（有时由市委集中上大课，现多由各机关组织学习）。为适应干部的工作时间，上课分为早班（清早）与晚班（晚饭后），由参加学习的干部自己选定。
    编班：干部和工作人员的文化水平很不一致，同一个人的文、理科程度也多不平衡，加之学习时间又有早班、晚班的区分，所以编班就成为一种极其复杂、细致的工作，同时也是关系干部能否学习好的极其重要的一环。唐山市干部业余文化学校经几年来的摸索，已初步找到了编班的门径。这就是要根据学员的具体情况编为多种多样的班次。文理程度平衡的编入普通班（正规班），文理科程度不平衡的编成混合班（以上两种班是主要的班次）。对少数文理科程度相差很大的人采用跨班制。而对某一科尚缺乏系统知识的，也可以只选修某一门课程。有时还开单科班，专为一些人提高某一课程，然后使他们能编入普通班。
    编班的方法：干部业余文化学校初办时，编班是根据学员入校填表所填原来文化程度及拟入班级分别编入的。但这样编的结果，多不符合学员的实际程度。后来又试行测验编班办法，但因答卷并不能与其实际程度完全一致，效果也不好。经过几次摸索，现在采取试听编班方法。就是校方和学员研究后，介绍进入和他程度相同的班里试验，并在一、两周内确定班级。这样，在两周内就可基本上将班次编好，并满足了学员的要求（在学员同时入学的太多时，个别了解就要差了。现正研究采用参照原文化程度及拟入班级、考试与试听三者结合起来的办法进行编班）。
    教材：
    语文教材：小学部分采用中共中央直属机关党委办公室编“机关干部业余学校国语课本”第一至六册。初中部分采用北京市工农教育社编“职工业余学校中级语文课本”第一至六册。算术采用本校编写的“工作人员算术课本”第一至六册。代数、几何皆以东北初中课本为蓝本，由学校自编。地理、历史、物理、化学等科都以人民出版社初中课本为蓝本精简选读。其中地理、历史并边讲边编。小学一、二年级各班学员（尚属文盲、半文盲或接近非文盲），都将推行速成识字法。速成识字后所省下来的时间（约节省两学期），在初中部拟适当增加自然、卫生的课目。
    三、组织领导——教学组织和教学制度
    唐山市干部业余文化学校在一九五○年八月前，直接由市委领导，一九五○年八月后，改由市文教局领导。总校部设有正副校长各一人，由市长与文教局长分别兼任，另设有专职的教务长一人。总校部设两科（教务科、总务科）一室（秘书室）。分校负责各该地区的干部文化学习，每分校设有主任与教务主任（或中心教员），教员与教务干事。
    教学组织与教学制度：由于干部是在业余时间学习，缺课、迟到、不交作业的现象是很容易产生的。必须及时加以纠正与防止。现每班除了每一班设有级任教员、班长外，并设立机关辅导教员，即把教员分组到机关去辅导学员学习。同一机关内的学员也组成机关小组，以互相督促并帮助补课。此外还制订了入学、转学、退学及请假制度，考勤和按期向各机关发送出缺席通知单以进行表扬和批评的制度，考试制度（每学期举行月考两次、期考一次）等，最后，在学期终了时向各机关发送成绩通知单，通过机关党委或支部再转交学员本人。这些制度都起着重要的作用。唐山市干部业余文化学校自建立教学组织与制度后，已收到很大的效果。使学员出席率从百分之六十提高到百分之八十五。
    四、几点经验
    三年以来，有以下几个主要经验：
     1、领导方面的重视是极重要的条件。在这点上，唐山市委与市政府是做得较好的。如：干部业余文化学校刚办时，市委就明确地提出了“集中办学，长期打算，专人负责，经费固定，稳步前进，精教细学”的方针，使干部业余文化学校有了方向可循。市委对于干部业余文化学校每年每季甚至每月的工作计划与总结都加以审查并提出意见。市委宣传部对编写的教材也认真审阅。市委、市政府负责同志经常在干部业余文化学校开学或总结大会上讲话，如市委书记李力果同志在学员入校复课大会上指示：“不努力学习文化，就是对革命不够负责。”他并提出：
    “机关负责人要保证工作与学习时间互不侵犯”。各机关党委与行政领导方面都想了很多办法保证文化学习。如各机关支部教育委员负责推动干部的理论、文化、业务学习，把学习作为支部生活小组检讨与机关鉴定内容之一。行政负责人主动解决干部学习时间与工作时间的矛盾。有些机关负责同志积极带头参加文化学习，起了很大推动作用。如酒厂厂长张建基同志学习很好，被评为学习模范，银行行长张逸生同志学习虚心努力，由于他们的带动，全机关的同志也都学得非常起劲。最后省、市的领导方面帮助干部业余文化学校解决了教员、经费及必要的设备问题。
     2、必须坚持正规化的方针。干部文化学习虽是业余的，但唐山市委提出的要长期打算、确立学制、专人负责的方针，是必要的。办业余文化教育的目的，是要从根本上解决在职干部的文化提高的问题。目前是使尚未具备初中毕业程度的干部达到初中毕业水平，今后还要尽可能再加以提高。其次，有确定的学制与各种不同程度的班次，才能使干部逐步提高。第三，城市中有很多便利条件（如集中、交通便利等），在可能条件下可统一领导，以便于开办各种班级与提高业务。第四，必须有专人负责校务，聘请足够的专任教员，并有一定的经费与设备（如办公的房屋、图书、简单理化仪器和挂图等）。
     3、必须及时纠正学员、教员、学校干部的各种错误思想。有些干部对学习缺乏信心，常以“年纪大，记性坏”为借口。有的把学习当成“政治待遇”，以为自己学文化不能参加理论学习是“降级”，或感觉和下级一起学习“丢人”。有的认为
    “工作忙的够呛，那有功夫学习？”待学习起来后，又往往发生以下的问题：不少的人对编班存在着好高骛远“宁高勿低”的思想，但也有少数人图省劲（或逃避理论学习）存在“宁低勿高”的思想。有的还产生急于求成的急躁情绪，遇到困难，又灰心丧气。还有些人只顾听讲不顾复习，不愿交作业。在师生关系上：有些学员看不起教员，认为教员政治水平太低，有的当面质问教员，有的故意从字典中找些怪字难教员。在教员方面，因他们多是些新招聘来的知识分子，开始对在干部业余文化学校教学、对学员以及在教学方法上都存在很多错误认识。他们较普遍的是缺乏信心，怕教干部，说干部不好“伺候”，“教教试试，砸锅就走”。学员不交作业，也不敢催；考试时，学员抄书，装没有看见。有的对干部业余文化学校和学员看不起。认为这种学校总不是正式的，不如教普通学校好；对学员则表面怕内心瞧不起，听到提意见，就讽刺：“没有文化，还挑肥拣瘦的！”甚至有个别教员一进教室就用手巾堵住鼻子，说学员脏。还有些人在教学中愿教新干部（多是原来的学生）不愿教老干部，认为老干部“笨”；编教材、编班、教课也总是多给有些文化基础的着想。此外，他们在思想上还较普遍地存在着许多资产阶级观点，甚至有些人还残存着反动思想的影响。学校工作的干部，开始也往往认为困难太多。针对以上不同对象、不同阶段的思想情况，领导方面必须不断进行思想教育，才能保证获得教学效果。如应对学员强调说明为了迎接经济建设的任务，没有文化技术不行。号召他们认真学习文化，尊师好学，“放下架子，当小学生”。强调学习文化要稳步前进，坚持复习与作业等。对教员说明教干部学文化的重大意义，号召他们把课教好，主动接近与帮助学员。要注意教员的政治学习与思想改造，吸收他们参加干部的政治理论学习。在业务上帮助他们，在日常生活中经常接近他们，关心他们。对学校工作干部要说明办干部文化学校的重大意义，并经常帮助他们解决困难。
    4、加强教学研究，结合学员特点来提高教学质量。
    学员是在职的干部，基本上都是成人，工作经验多，理解力强，工作忙，学习时间少，学了就要求应用。因此教学须掌握“少而精”的原则和“速成”的精神。就课程来说，不宜同时并学很多科目（“多头并进”），至多同时学两门。着重质量，不求形式。在教学进度上，应采取直线上升的办法，学科与学科衔接的地方应避免重复（如初中算术与小学重复等），单元与单元之间避免反复。在教学方法上应联系实际、学以致用。如国文教了写信的方法，就让学员多练习写信。教数学也强调如何在实际生活与工作中的应用。
    经验证明，改进教学最有效的办法之一是成立与加强各科教研组，强调加强业务学习与集体备课。这对教员业务与思想水平的提高，教员与教员间、教员与学员间的团结上都起了很大的作用。
    五、存在的问题
    唐山市干部业余文化教育中还存在两个问题：第一、有些干部工作太忙，经常缺课，年年留级（全校不能按时升级的占百分之五），他们迫切要求入速成中学。第二、缺乏一套适合在职干部的文化教材。
