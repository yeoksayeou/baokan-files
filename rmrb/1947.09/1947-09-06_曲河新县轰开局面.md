Grasp Land Concentrated in the Hands of Traitorous Overlords; The People Yearn for Emancipation

　　Quhe New County Breaks Through
    [Report from this newspaper in the Jilu豫 region on the 4th] The land reform movement in Quhe County (newly designated county), a newly liberated area located along the Yellow River, north of Fengqiu City and south of Changyuan City, is developing rapidly and enthusiastically. From July 7th to 26th, within twenty days, 300 out of 400 villages in the county broke through. For the past ten years, the county has been under the bloody rule of puppet, miscellaneous, and stubborn elements, and land has been concentrated in the hands of a few landlords and local bullies. Zhao Zhenduo (from Huanglingji), a puppet bandit leader, has concentrated more than 30 mu of land over the years. Liu Fengtong (from Liuguangji) has concentrated more than 30 mu. Liang Huazhi, the puppet township head of Wulou in Lanfeng (puppet district chief during the Japanese occupation), has 100 mu. In Youfang Village, in the Third District, the entire village has 160 households and 20 mu of land. Among them, five landlord households own 15 mu of land, while 130 poor and impoverished peasant households average less than two mu per person. The landlords' ruthless exploitation and suppression have made it impossible for the vast number of poor peasants to survive, generating a strong desire for economic and political emancipation. After liberation, all the county cadres entered the area on July 7th, and in just four days, by the 11th, 40 villages had broken through. The masses were distributed over 2,000 dan of grain. On the first day of entering the area, the cadres went to various villages to encourage the masses to distribute grain and property. Zhou and Yang villages near Liuguangji organized themselves that very night and elected representatives to carry out joint actions. The enthusiasm of the vast number of peasants was so high and the movement developed so rapidly that it was unexpected. Due to the high morale of the masses, all the county cadres decided to make every effort to break through the situation in the entire county. Taking Liuguangji as the center, they attacked in four directions: west, east, south, and southeast, advancing ten li every day, truly distributing property and grain wherever they went. The western route reached the Yellow River bank east of Chenqiao on the fourth day. On July 18th, the enemy gathered small groups in the Huanglingji area to struggle desperately. Our army launched a mopping-up operation on the 21st. After the enemy was eliminated, more than 100 villages distributed floating wealth. At this time, the masses in the entire Quhe County had begun to take action. Representative conferences were held in the First and Third Districts, and general representatives have been elected in the Panheji area. The fruits have also been preliminarily and rationally distributed. Currently, preparations are being made to distribute land.

    【本报冀鲁豫四日电】位于黄河沿岸封邱城北长垣城南的曲河县（新划县）新解放区土地改革运动迅速热烈开展。自七月七日至二十六日二十天中，全县四百村有三百村轰开局面。该县十年来受伪杂顽血腥统治，土地集中到少数地主恶霸之手。伪匪头子赵振铎（黄陵集人）数年来集中土地三十余顷，刘凤桐（留光集人）集中三十余顷，兰封武楼伪乡长（日寇在时伪区长）梁化之百顷。三区油房村全村一百六十户，二十顷地，其中五户地主占有土地十五顷，每人平均二亩以下之贫农与赤贫一百三十户。地主无情的剥削与镇压，广大的贫苦农民已无法生活，产生强烈的经济政治翻身要求。解放后，全县干部于七月七日进到该地，至十一日仅四天，已有四十余村打开局面。群众分到粮食二千余石。干部进境第一日即分赴各村，启发群众分粮分财。留光集附近周、杨二庄当天夜里即组织起来，并选出代表，实行联合行动，广大农民情绪之高，运动开展之迅速，出乎意外。由于群众情绪高涨，全县干部决定以全力打开全县局面。以留光集为中心，向西、东、南、东南四路进攻，每日前进十里，真是走到那里，财粮分到那里。西路于第四日已到陈桥以东之黄河岸上。七月十八日，黄陵集一带敌集结小股垂死挣扎，我军乃于二十一日展开扫荡战，敌被肃清后，又有百余村分了浮财。此时曲河全县群众已开始行动，我在一、三区召开了代表大会潘合集一带已选出总代表，果实亦已初步合理分配，目前正准备进行分配土地。
