　　【本报太行十一日电】Under the frantic extortion of Yan's puppet regime, which declared "Rather let a hundred old people starve to death than let one soldier starve," more than ten villages of refugees have been forced to flee to our Yuci liberated area. The refugees have spontaneously organized political power and armed forces to resist the tyrannical rule of Yan's puppet regime. Since the summer harvest, the people of the Third District of the county, after fleeing to the liberated area, have witnessed the land reform eliminating feudalism and the peasants turning over, which has further aroused their anger to settle scores and take revenge on the treacherous landlords. They have successively requested the democratic government to arm them to fight back for revenge and settlement. More than ten villages of refugees immediately organized two democratic joint village offices and armed forces with ×× people. On the night of the 22nd of last month, the first democratic joint armed force first advanced into Xiaojianan and Dongshuang villages for guerrilla activities, captured three landlords including Gao Geta, and seized four heads of livestock. Everyone excitedly said: "Our livestock is being fed in our troughs again! We will also take back the wheat fields to plant wheat and survive the famine!" The second democratic joint armed force also penetrated into Gong Village on the night of the 27th, captured Zhang Jidog, the landlord and special agent's running dog, and his brother from Yangliang Village, and immediately handed them over to the masses of Yangliang Village for disposal. Now these two refugee armed forces are frequently active along the railway line and behind enemy lines, combining with the masses to crack down on Yan's puppet plainclothes activities.

　　Also: The people in the Yan-controlled areas, unable to bear Yan's puppet regime's extortion, are desperately resisting tyranny. In Haocun village, west of Yuci Road, an old man named Hao killed three enemies with a kitchen knife. The old couple, named Hao, lived in poverty, with only five dou of wheat in their home, but unexpectedly, on August 10th, they were "requisitioned" by Yan's puppet regime, and the old couple had nothing to eat or drink and cried bitterly. The next day, the old couple had to go to the fields hungry and picked up wheat for three or four days (the local people were not interested in production due to Yan's puppet regime's extortion, and the harvesting was rough). Just over two dou that had been picked up were all taken away by the township office. Old man Hao was indignant and silent, sharpened his kitchen knife overnight, ran to the township office, and hacked to death the pseudo-instructor and special agent of the village township office and left. The township head and township police immediately chased after him, and the old man stood upright and cursed: "Come on, you sons of bitches! Even if it's my old life, I can exchange it for a few!" He slashed the township head half to death with a knife, and the old man also died heroically on the spot. The local masses secretly said: "Cats don't climb trees unless they're in a hurry, and rabbits don't bite unless they're in a hurry. Yan Xishan is forcing us to rebel!"

　　榆次农民逃奔我区组织武装回去复仇
    【本报太行十一日电】在阎伪“宁饿死一百个老百姓，不饿死一个兵”的疯狂勒索下，已有十余村难民被迫逃来我榆次解放区。难民已自动组织政权武装，抵抗阎伪暴政。夏收以来，该县三区人民，逃至解放区后，目睹土地改革消灭封建，农民翻身，更加激起向奸霸地主清算复仇的怒火。纷纷向民主政府要求武装起来打回去报仇清算。十多个村难民，当即组织起两个民主联合村公所及武装××人。上月二十二日夜，第一民主联合武装，首先挺进小伽南和东双村游击活动，捉回地主郜圪塔等三人，夺得牲口四头。大家兴奋的说：“咱的牲口又喂在咱的槽上了！咱还要夺回麦地种麦渡荒！”第二民主联合武装，亦于二十七日夜深入巩村，捉回杨梁村地主特务狗腿张计狗兄弟二人，当即交给杨梁村群众处理。现这两支难民武装，经常活跃铁路沿线及敌后，结合群众打击阎伪便衣活动。
    又：不堪阎伪勒索的阎管区人民，拚死抗暴。榆次路西郝村，郝姓老汉，以厨刀杀敌三名。该老汉老俩口，穷困渡日，家里仅有五斗麦，不意在八月十日被阎伪“征走”，老俩口当下无吃无喝，号啕痛哭。次日老俩口只好饿着肚子到野外拾了三四天麦子（当地人民因阎伪勒索，无心生产，收割粗糙。）刚拾的二斗多，又被乡公所悉数倒光。郝老汉愤慨不语，连夜磨快厨刀，跑到乡公所，将该村乡公所伪指导员，特务员乱刀砍死而去。乡长、乡警觉即追，老汉直立大骂：“狗日们来，就是我这条老命，能换几个换几个！”一刀又将乡长劈了个半死，老汉亦当场壮烈牺牲。当地群众都暗暗的说：“猫不急不上树，兔不急不咬人，阎锡山逼的非造反不行！”
