	From Beasts to Humans
	A Record of Confessions by KMT Officers Liberated in Military Academies
	Mei Cun
	Following a month of ideological education, the class consciousness of the ××× liberated and defected lower-ranking KMT officers in the Military and Political University rapidly advanced. They unanimously recognized that the only way forward was to forever follow the Communist Party and completely eliminate Chiang Kai-shek. They first launched a movement to recount their suffering and confess their crimes. Some recounted suffering, but most confessed crimes. From these confessions, they came to understand everything:

	Yang Yuying, a secretary in the regimental headquarters of the 2nd Regiment, 1st Brigade, 1st Division of Hu Zongnan's army, studying in the Second Brigade, wept bitterly, saying: "During the encirclement and annihilation of the Central Plains Military Region, I used a stone to smash a wounded New Fourth Army soldier to death... This comrade had no quarrel with me! Why was I so inhuman!..."

	Wang Yikong, a sergeant who defected from the 32nd Division, pounded his chest and stamped his feet, crying: "My name isn't Wang Yikong, my name is Beast! ... I joined the Kuomintang and the Red Gang in the Central Army, and shamelessly raped more than fifty civilian women. When stationed in Hubei, I robbed seven poor people on the road... I served in the old army for over twenty years, and for those twenty years, I did nothing but inhuman things!..."

	Li Yuanchun, a plainclothes soldier in the 2nd Machine Gun Company, 2nd Battalion, 8th Regiment, 3rd Brigade of the Reorganized 3rd Division, tearfully confessed that when he was a soldier in the 3rd Platoon, 1st Company, 109th Regiment of the 19th Division, stationed in Liuyang, Hunan, he raped a respectable woman to death. When he was a squad leader in the 9th Platoon, 3rd Battalion, 16th Regiment of the 74th Division, stationed in Guangxi, he led his entire squad to rape three fifteen or sixteen-year-old girls to death, and also robbed and buried a Jia chief alive. When he was a squad leader in the Special Service Regiment of the Military Police Department, stationed in Yangshupen, Chongqing, he raped a sixteen-year-old female student. When he was a soldier in the cavalry company of the 62nd Division, he robbed and beat a passing civilian to death. When he was a soldier in the anti-aircraft artillery team of the Air Defense School, he deliberately destroyed a village. When he was a soldier in the 2nd Machine Gun Company, 2nd Battalion, 8th Regiment, 3rd Brigade of the Reorganized 3rd Division, during the attack on Dayang Lake, he collaborated with others to burn down the houses of the people in Lijiazhai, smashing jars, ladles, pots, and bowls… He stole some of the hundreds of barrels of sesame oil from the privately-run oil mill, poured the rest on the street, smashed a small child to death with a stone, and cut off his ears. He used grenades to kill the civilians hiding in the cave…

	He cried out frantically, "...My sins are too numerous! I'm not human at all, I'm a beast!..." Some, during their intense confessions, slapped their own faces wildly, swelling them up, and banged their heads against the wall...

	After confessing their crimes, they began to discuss: "Where did these sins come from? Why did we commit so many crimes?..." After recalling and discussing, from the endless facts of Chiang Kai-shek deceiving, obscuring, poisoning, and harming them, they said, "We were all innocent youths, but once we entered Chiang Kai-shek's army, we became covered in filth. Chiang Kai-shek gave us this!"

	Li Yuanchun recalled: "My family was in Hunan. When I was little, the landlord seized our house and land. My father worked as a laborer, and my mother, sister, and I did odd jobs for others. The Red Army came to our hometown and distributed houses and land to us. I also joined the children's corps. Later, the Central Army came and confiscated our houses and land. They dragged my sister to the county government, and when she refused to be humiliated, they strangled her to death with a rope. They arrested my father and put him in jail. I didn't dare stay at home, so I ran away and became a soldier... My original intention in joining the army was to avenge my sister and father, but who knew I would be blinded and used by the enemy!" Wang Jinhu, a lieutenant platoon leader of the 21st Regiment of the 72nd Yan Army Division, cried after confessing his crimes: "At home, I couldn't live because of the exploitation and oppression of the landlords. I joined the army to seek revenge, but who knew that over the years, not only did I not get revenge, but I became a tool against the people!..."

	He recognized the enemy who had destroyed and harmed him, and therefore, he loved the Communist Party, which had saved them and led them onto the path of light, even more. As Li Yuanchun said: "I have only been on the side of the Eighth Route Army for a few months, and I already understand what it means for the army and the people to be one family, and what it means to love the people. I don't visit the homes of ordinary people unless I have to. When I see the women of the common people, I am well-behaved and no longer have evil thoughts. When I see the villagers, I address them respectfully as uncle and aunt, and I am very friendly. When I borrow something, I don't allow myself not to take it. I always write a note when I borrow it, and compensate for any losses. When I have time, I also help the villagers grind grain, carry water, plant crops, and harvest... Why have I now been transformed from a beast back into a human? It is the Communist Party that educated me and made me a human being! It is the Communist Party that saved me!..."

	In a letter to the school leaders, the liberated officers of the Second Team of the Second Brigade said: "Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan deceived us and made us do many bad things! They made us criminals of the nation and enemies of the people, and made us lose our future... Fortunately, the Communist Party liberated us and gave us a way out... Looking back on the past... we are sorry to the Communist Party, sorry to the People's Liberation Army... We shed tears and cried bitterly! We now confess to the people and the Communist Party, and confess all our mistakes and sins to the organization, and tell our dear mother—the Communist Party—that we recognize our benefactor as Chairman Mao, and our enemy as Chiang Kai-shek, that bastard grandson!..."

	They recognized the enemy and the benefactor, and therefore, they expressed their determination and took oaths.

	For example, Ding Zhaonan, a sergeant clerk of the mountain artillery battalion of the 129th Brigade of the 47th Division, and more than thirty other liberated officers, used knives to carve blue characters the size of a finger on their arms: "Oppose America, Oppose Chiang, Eliminate the Chiang Bandit!" Many other teams also carved the same words. Almost every liberated officer, at the company's determination meeting, in front of Chairman Mao's portrait, automatically bit his middle finger and wrote a blood letter to the Communist Party organization, expressing his determination to eliminate the Chiang bandits and perform meritorious service for the people. And, immediately turn determination into action. In addition to confessing to the Communist Party about their participation in the Jiang Yan's party and secret service organizations, they also eagerly handed over: party cards, military academy diplomas, letters of appointment, travel permits... etc., to show that they severed all ties with Jiang Yan and were closely aligned with the Communist Party.

	Some comrades also handed over their only money and property to support the front lines and enhance the strength to defeat Chiang Kai-shek. For example, Wang Yikong handed over nineteen rounds of pistol bullets and the quilts, clothes, and 22,000 yuan in legal tender he brought from the old army. He even pulled out his gold tooth and handed it over to support the front lines. Another example is Wang Naidong, a lieutenant platoon leader of the 2nd Platoon, 1st Company, 1st Battalion, 2nd Regiment of Hu Zongnan's "World's First Division," who, when handing over his gold ring weighing six or seven qian, which he had saved for many years, said excitedly to everyone: "I will hand it over to sell more bullets and use them to overthrow Chiang Kai-shek!"

    由禽兽变成人
    军大被解放蒋军军官诉罪记
    梅村
    军政大学×××名解放和起义过来的蒋军下级军官，经过一个月的思想教育，阶级觉悟，都迅速提高了一步。一致认识到：只有永远跟着共产党，彻底消灭蒋介石，才是自己的唯一出路。他们首先展开了诉苦诉罪运动。有的诉了苦，但大部份是诉了罪。从诉罪中认识了一切：
    在二大队学习的胡宗南第一师第一旅二团团部书记杨毓英痛哭着说：围歼中原军区时，我曾用石头砸死了一个新四军的负伤战士，…………这个同志与我没仇呀！我为什么这样没人性啊！………。
    三十二师起义过来的军士王一孔，挺胸跺足地哭着说：“我不叫王一孔，我叫禽兽！…………我在中央军里参加了国民党，红帮，无耻地奸淫的老百姓妇女在五十个以上，光在湖北驻防时，就劫路抢光了穷苦群众七人…………我在旧军队干了二十多年，这二十多年，做的净不是人事！…………”
    整三师三旅八团二营机枪二连便衣李元春，哭着忏悔他在十九师一百零九团一营三连当兵，住防湖南浏阳时，曾奸死了一个良家媳妇，在七十四师十六团三营九连当班长住防广西时，曾率领全班，奸死三个十五六岁的少女，并抢劫、活埋一个甲长，在军警部特务团当班长驻防重庆杨树盆时，曾强奸十六岁的女学生，在六十二师骑兵连当兵时，曾抢劫、打死一个过路的老百姓，在防空学校高射炮队当兵时，曾故意炸毁一个村庄，在整三师三旅八团二营机枪二连当兵，进攻大杨湖时，曾协同其它人把李家寨老百姓的房子烧光，缸、瓢、锅、碗，…………砸碎，把民营油坊的几百桶香油，抢走一部份，把剩下的倒在街上，把一个小孩子用石头砸死，还割去耳朵。把藏在洞里的老百姓，用手榴弹炸死…………。
    他疯狂地哭叫着说：“……我的罪恶太多了！我根本就不是人，我是禽兽！……”有的当激烈忏悔时，没头没脑地打自己脸，把脸打成肿的，把脑袋朝墙上碰……。
    诉罪后，他们又展开讨论：“我们这些罪恶是那来的？我们为什么曾犯这样多罪？……”经过回忆，交谈，从举不完的蒋介石欺骗、蒙蔽、毒化、残害他们的事实中，他们说“自己都是青青白白的青年，一进到蒋介石的军队，就染上了一身肮脏，这是蒋介石给我们的！”
    李元春回忆着说：“我家在湖南，小时，房子地被财主夺去，父亲给人打月工，母亲、姐姐、和我，给人家做零活，红军到我们家乡，曾分给我们房子、地，我也曾参加了儿童团，后来，中央军去到那里，没收了我们的房子地，把姐姐拉到县政府，侮辱不从，用绳子勒死，把父亲抓到监牢里，我不敢在家，跑出来当兵，……我当兵的志愿，本来是为姐姐、父亲报仇的，谁知被蒙住了眼，反为仇人利用了！……”阎军七十二师二十一团少尉排长王金虎，诉罪后哭着说：“我在家因受地主压榨剥削，没法过日子，为了报仇才参加军队的，谁知，几年来，不但仇没报，反而变成了反人民的工具！……”
    他认清了摧残陷害自己的仇敌，因之，对挽救他们走了光明的共产党，就更加热爱。如李元春说：“我来到八路军这边才几个月，我已经懂得什么是军民一家，什么是爱民了。我没事不到老百姓家串，见了老百姓妇女，规规矩矩，再不生邪念，见了老乡，称伯道娘，亲亲热热，借东西，不允许不拿，借必打条子，损失了赔偿，有空还帮助老乡们推磨、担水、种地、秋收、……我现在为什么又由禽兽变成人了？这是共产党把我教育成人的！这是共产党救了我！……”
    二大队二队解放军官给校首长的信中说：“蒋介石阎锡山蒙蔽着我们使我们做了许多坏事！使我们成了民族的罪人，人民的公敌，使我们丧失了前途，…………幸而，共产党解放了我们，给我们一生路，……回想过去，……对不起共产党，对不起人民解放军，……我们流下眼泪，痛心地哭啊！我们现在向人民及共产党忏悔，把全部的错误、罪恶，坦白给组织，告诉亲爱的妈妈——共产党，我们认清了恩人是毛主席，仇人是蒋介石王八蛋狗孙子！……”
    他们认清了仇人，认清了恩人，因而，纷纷表示决心，宣誓。
    如四十七师一百廿九旅山炮营文书上士丁兆南等三十多位解放军官，用刀子在臂上刻着指头那么大的蓝字：“反美、反蒋、消灭蒋贼！”其它队刻同样字的也很多。几乎每一个解放军官，都在连队的决心大会上，在毛主席像前，自动咬破中指，写血书呈给共产党的组织，表明自己消灭蒋贼，为民立功的意志。并且，立即把决心变成行动。除把自己参加蒋阎的党派特务组织，向共产党坦白外，还争先恐后地交出了：党证、军校毕业证书、委任状、路条……等以表示他们割断与蒋阎的一切连系，都紧密靠近共产党。
    还有些同志，把自己仅有的钱财，也交公支援前线，以增强打败蒋介石的力量。如王一孔交出手枪子弹十九粒及由旧军队带来的被子、衣服及二万二千元法币，甚至把镶的金牙也拔掉，交出来支援前线。又如胡宗南“天下第一师”一旅二团一营二连的中尉排长王耐东，把自己保存多年的六七钱重的金戒指交公时，曾向大家激动地说：“我把它交出来，多卖几粒子弹，拿去打倒蒋介石！”
