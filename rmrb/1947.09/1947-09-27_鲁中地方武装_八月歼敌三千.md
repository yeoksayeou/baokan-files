In the last ten days of the month, the military and civilians of Central Shandong encircled and suppressed the remaining "Home-Coming Corps" retreating to the border area of Xin (Tai), Lai (Wu) and Meng (yin), and annihilated more than 1,000 of them in the area east of Huangzhuang Beishidian. The local army also took the initiative to pursue a certain detachment of the Chiang bandit transportation and liaison troops between isolated strongholds. On August 1st, they annihilated more than 60 Chiang bandits behind Lishan, destroyed 5 cars, and seized more than 10,000 kilograms of rice. On the 23rd, a platoon of the detachment ambushed a unit of the 83rd Division of Chiang bandits on the Yi-Meng Highway, killing or wounding more than 100 enemies below the battalion commander in half an hour, and seizing some ammunition and mules and horses.
