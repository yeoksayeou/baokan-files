　　Correspondence
  　No. 26
    To Comrades Correspondents in various places: Our counter-offensive army is annihilating the Chiang bandits, and good news is frequently reported. Please mobilize urgently to cooperate with the propaganda campaign for the great counter-offensive. On the one hand, strive to publicize the victory news to the masses, and at the same time, seize the opportunity to report on this movement. The reporting content can focus on: 1. The situation of carrying out the great counter-offensive propaganda in a county, a district, and a village, the reactions and expressions of the masses; 2. The actual actions of the masses in various places and the party, government, military, and civilian organs in supporting the front line; 3. Condolences and care for the families of the commanders and fighters of the counter-offensive army, the militiamen on the expedition, and the families of the laborers (such as solving their production difficulties, etc.). In addition, it is hoped that you will conduct in-depth interviews with the families of the commanders and fighters, militiamen, and laborers who are on the expedition, and organize them to write letters to comfort their relatives. Such letters can be sent to this newspaper to be forwarded to the front or sent to Handan Radio Station to be conveyed to the front (the station now has a special program to broadcast the condolence messages from the families of the soldiers to the front).
