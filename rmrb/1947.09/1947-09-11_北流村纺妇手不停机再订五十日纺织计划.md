[Report from the newspaper office in Licheng] After summarizing the hoeing campaign, the women of Beiliu Village, in order to increase production and supplement the harvest shortfall caused by the drought, held a village-wide women's weaving meeting under the leadership of the spinning hero group. Taihang spinning hero Liu Zhongjing said, "We have summarized the second hundred-day weaving plan. We did a lot of work in the fields and also spun 930 jin of cotton, wove 4,684 chi of cloth, and exchanged it for 30 dan of grain. This time, let's have another fifty-day weaving plan. Except for the winter change of seasons, we will exchange the rest for grain to make up for the reduced harvest due to the drought." His correct statement raised everyone's enthusiasm for weaving. The following thoughts were discovered in the discussion: Lu Xian'e could originally spin ten jin of yarn, but he only ordered eight jin because he was afraid of losing face if he didn't complete it on time. Wang Yinqun could originally spin twelve jin of cotton, but he saw that others were ordering less, so he also ordered less. He thought it was enough to wear! The key to breaking through these thoughts was to master the method of specifically breaking through specific thoughts. For example, Zhang Xiaju used accounting to break through Lu Xian'e's thoughts. Wang Yinqun's thoughts were also broken through under the influence of Wang Xueping's plan to weave 500 chi of cloth and spin five jin of yarn in fifty days, and he ordered a plan to spin twelve jin of cotton himself. After breaking through these thoughts, at the same time, the slogan "Sell cloth, not cotton, weaving makes the family rich, except for the seasonal change, exchange the rest for grain" was put forward, which encouraged everyone's enthusiasm and smoothly ordered the plan. Wang Gai said, "Although I am old, I help my man feed the livestock at home. In these fifty days, I will spin fifteen jin of cotton." In such a warm situation, all the women in the village did their best to order, determined to achieve the three major combinations without disconnection in these fifty days. A total of 195 women (excluding those who are sick and living at their mother's home) will spin a total of 1,170 jin of cotton and weave a total of 6,670 chi of cloth. The five weaving teams in the village are all launching revolutionary and fraternal challenges to each other. Currently, weaving in the village is in full swing.

　　北流村纺妇手不停机再订五十日纺织计划
    【本报黎城讯】北流村经过总结抢锄运动后，该村妇女为了增产，以纺织来补充旱灾的歉收，在纺英集团的带头下，全村召开了全体纺妇会。太行纺英刘仲景说：“咱总结了第二个百日纺织计划，上地做了好多活，还纺了九百三十斤花，织了四千六百八十四尺布，还换了三十石粮，咱这次再来个五十天纺织计划，除了冬季换季外，剩余的都换成粮食，来补充旱灾的少收数。”在他的正确说法下，提高了大家对纺织的情绪，在讨论中发现了以下几种思想：路先娥本来自己能纺十斤线，他才订了八斤，原因是怕到期完不成丢了人。王引群本来能纺十二斤花，他看到别人订的少，自己也订少，他认为够穿就算啦！这些思想的打通，主要是掌握了具体思想具体打通的办法，如路先娥的思想，张夏菊用算帐方式给他打通，王引群的思想在王雪平的计划五十天织布五百尺，纺线五斤的影响下他自己也订了纺十二斤花计划，经打通这些思想，同时提出：“卖布不卖花，纺织把家发，除了把季换，其余换成粮”的口号，鼓舞了大家情绪，顺利的订开了计划，王改说：“我虽老了，在家帮帮男人喂牲口，在这五十天里我纺花十五斤”，在这样热烈的情况下，全村的纺妇都尽自己的力量来订，决心在这五十天内，一定要做到三大结合不脱节。共妇一百九十五人，（除病在娘家住的不在内）共纺花一千一百七十斤，共织布六千六百七十尺，全村五个纺织大队，各队与各队都开展革命友爱挑战，现该村纺织正热火朝天的行动起来。（北流通讯组东魁、文秀）
