Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 8th. Comprehensive report: The 76th Annual Conference of British Trade Unions opened in Southport, western England, on the 1st and closed on the 5th. The characteristic of this conference lies in the Labour government's eagerness to stabilize its political foundation, which is being shaken by the economic crisis, and it does not hesitate to adopt "extremely important cadres" (Agence France-Presse, 1st) and various deceptions against the conference participants. Bevin stated in his speech on the 3rd: "People condemn me, saying that I want to bind us to the United States, good heavens! Now I ask you to fight for independence in the factories. I hope Britain is independent of both East and West." Bevin also said: "The British government will implement its guarantee to demobilize all wartime enlisted personnel by the end of 1948." Bevin's speech aroused fierce criticism from left-wing elements in the trade union. According to a Reuters report on the 4th, the left-wing proposed: "Britain should establish mutually beneficial trade and commercial relations with all democratic countries in Europe and the Soviet Union," and "resist the dollar oppression in the Truman-Marshall Plan," and other motions. Although these motions were rejected by Bevin and his supporters, the strength of the left-wing opponents made Bevin so fearful that "the vote was taken by a show of hands, without counting the votes." The debate on the immediate nationalization of the steel industry on the 4th also demonstrated the division within the Labour Party. The faction headed by Bevin, Morrison, Attlee, and others in the Labour Party authorities insisted that implementing steel nationalization during the economic crisis was an "unwise move," because implementing the bill would anger American "friends," lose any possibility of new American loans, and greatly offend the Conservative and Liberal Party bosses in the steel industry. Therefore, a popular "rumor" in Britain says: Under internal and external pressure, "the British cabinet is planning to abolish the bill" (Agence France-Presse, 5th). However, in the vote on this issue on the 5th, out of a total of 7,210,000 votes, there were still 2,360,000 or 32.7 percent of the votes against it, insisting on the immediate nationalization of steel. When the conference opened on the 1st, although the conference passed a resolution requesting miners to stop absenteeism and increase work, the number of striking miners in southern Yorkshire increased from 30,000 at the end of last month to 60,000 on the 5th. Under the leadership of their newly elected strike leaders, the strikers, ignoring the obstruction of the original union leaders, insisted on fighting against increasing working hours.

　　执行反动政策陷入经济危机
  　英工党内部分裂加深左派力主与苏建立互惠贸易
    【新华社陕北八日电】综合报导：英国职工会第七十六届年会，一日于英格兰西部之南港开会，于五日闭幕。此次会议之特点，乃在工党政府亟图稳定其由经济危机而形动摇的政治基础，竟不惜对大会与会者采取“极重要的干部”（法新社一日电）及各种哄骗。贝文于三日发表演说称：“人们谴责我，说我想把我们束缚于美国，天哪！现在我请求你们在工厂里为独立而奋斗。我希望英国对东方西方都独立。”贝文并称：“英国政府将实行其保证，到一九四八年底解除一切战时入伍的人员”。贝文的演说，引起职工会中左翼分子的猛烈抨击。据路透社四日电，左派提出：“英国应与欧洲一切民主国家及苏联建立互惠贸易与商业关系”，并“抵抗杜鲁门马歇尔政策中的美元压迫”等议案，此等议案虽为贝文及其拥护者所否决，但左派反对者的力量竟使贝文如此恐惧，“表决采取了举手方式，未计票数。”四日关于钢铁业立即实行国有化问题的辩论，亦表现了工党内部的分裂。工党当局中以贝文、摩里逊、艾德礼等为首的一派，坚持在经济危机中实行钢铁国有为“不明智之举”，因为实行该法案既将震怒美国“朋友”，失掉美国新贷款的任何可能，且会大大冒犯钢铁业的保守党及自由党老板。因此英国流行的“谣言”说：在内外压力下，“英内阁正拟废止该法案”（法新社五日电）。但五日在对这一问题的表决中，在七百二十一万票总数中，仍有二百三十六万或百分之三十二点七的反对票，它们坚持立即实行钢铁国有。一日开会时，大会虽通过决议，要求矿工停止旷工而增加工作，但是约克郡南部的矿工罢工者，则自上月底之三万人增至五日的六万人，罢工者在其新选的罢工领袖领导下，不顾原来工会领袖的阻挠，坚持为反对增加工时而斗争。
