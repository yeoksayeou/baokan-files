　　Wounded Soldiers Have a Home
  　Introducing the Political Work of a Field Hospital under the Taiyue Military Region
    The No. 1 Field Hospital of the Taiyue Military Region was originally formed by merging the No. 3 and No. 5 hospitals of the Taiyue First Military Subdistrict. In the spring of last year, influenced by the idea of peace, many hospital staff members requested demobilization, transfer, retirement, and return home. They were perfunctory in their work and lacked a serious and responsible spirit. Furthermore, some convalescents became arrogant and even beat and scolded staff members after being admitted, which further increased the staff's unease and dissatisfaction. This led to some comrades developing "retaliatory" thoughts, believing that convalescents were "mischievous" and that only by giving them a hard time could they be managed. As a result, the relationship worsened, and the work became more difficult. Later, after the party and cadres of No. 1 Hospital, along with all comrades, studied the ideological conditions of the convalescents and staff, the leadership first focused on examining itself, believing that the fundamental reason was the staff's lack of a clear understanding of the idea of "serving the convalescents." After this was changed, unprecedented results were achieved: (1) 99.34% of the convalescents returned to their units (excluding the disabled). (2) The mortality rate of sick and wounded soldiers, with a relatively large number of seriously injured and sick soldiers admitted, decreased from 5% to 2.8%. (3) There were no desertions among the staff throughout the year. The main experiences were:

    I. Clearly Establish the Idea of "Serving the Convalescents" to Enhance the Staff's Sense of Responsibility and Enthusiasm

    The rectification of the relationship between staff and convalescents began with the hospital organizing a forum for staff and convalescents, focusing on self-criticism and explaining the past lack of spirit of "serving the convalescents," and asking the convalescents to offer their opinions. Touched by this spirit, the convalescents also reviewed their wrongdoings and offered some suggestions for improving the work. From then on, the relationship was indeed improved considerably, making the staff feel deeply: "As long as you care about the convalescents, you don't have to worry about others being unreasonable; it's still your own fault for not serving the convalescents well." Morale gradually stabilized. The Party Committee of No. 1 Hospital, based on the mood of the masses at the time, and after deliberation by the branches and the masses, launched a learning and competition movement throughout the hospital on "serving the convalescents." Individuals all formulated competition plans, and the leadership summarized the criteria for model nurses and model cooks. Last summer, during the political rectification, the unhealthy tendencies under the influence of the idea of "peace" were cleared up and overcome. For example, comrades in the cooking班 said: "I work actively because I realize what Chiang Kai-shek is good for." Those individuals with serious problems who refused to correct their mistakes were subjected to mass criticism meetings and were punished. Model workers were also commended, and everyone learned from the good examples. As medical assistant Zhao Dongzhi said: "It's not easy to find bad people in this hospital."

    On this ideological basis, everyone specifically analyzed and studied the psychological and ideological conditions of the convalescents, proposing that they should be diligent and patient in explaining, understanding, and comforting. Individuals and departments all formulated work plans. For example, one person in the cooking班 had to cook for nearly thirty people, and also had to ensure the variety of food; for example, one catty of rice and noodles per person per day, one catty of vegetables, twelve taels of tofu, three taels of vermicelli, and meat (seven taels) every three days, special pot of chicken soup, egg soup, oil tea, dumplings, and small pot of non-repetitive meals within four days. Despite such heavy tasks, the cooking班 did not complain, and fearing that the food would not suit their tastes or meet their nutritional needs, they often solicited opinions from the wards; for example, cooking班 leader Gao Jianzhang sat by the bed of Convalescent × one day, bringing up various nutritious foods and asking for the convalescent's opinion. The convalescent initially did not want to eat, but Comrade Lao Gao did not give up and still earnestly asked what he wanted to eat. The wounded soldier then said, "I'm afraid to bother you, I want to eat yam millet porridge." Comrade Gao quickly returned to the kitchen, made it, and brought it to him. No. 1 Hospital realized that the food of the convalescents was a very important issue, and specially organized a life research group, which met every ten days, with the attending physician, political instructor, logistics officer, cooking班 leader, director of the management committee, and adjustment committee member (the latter two were selected from the convalescents) participating, specifically studying methods to ensure that the food of the convalescents was both in line with their tastes and in line with the doctor's prescriptions.

    Doctors and nurses specifically organized technical research meetings, combining past practical experience, and studying new treatment methods, cultivating seventeen nurses with relatively high skills, researching while treating, reducing a lot of the suffering of the convalescents. It was also stipulated that nurses should report the wounded and sick soldiers' illnesses, psychological attitudes, diet, and bowel movements to the doctor every day, so that the doctor could be familiar with the situation and prescribe the right medicine. Therefore, many convalescents were very grateful. Doctors and convalescents achieved harmony in their emotions. Each nurse took care of more than fifteen wounded and sick soldiers, day and night, and even when they were beaten and scolded, they would still explain it well. For example, nurse Wang Yueying was beaten and scolded for advising Convalescent × (company commander) not to eat snacks, but the nurses could all understand the convalescents: "Because they are in pain, they are prone to being irritable."

    II. Promote the Spirit of Unity and Fraternity and Implement Large-Scale Mutual Assistance

    Because everyone was determined to do a good job, the staff achieved unprecedented unity and highly promoted the spirit of class fraternity and mutual assistance, which further enhanced the enthusiasm of the staff. Each person's work plan in the cooking班 included helping the nurses, such as helping the nurses to fetch water to the ward. Cooks Liu Jianye and Xiao Wanshi took a few pieces of clothing from the convalescents to the ward every day and helped wash them when they had time, sometimes helping to work the night shift. The nursing班 helped the cooking班 carry water and cook, and helped them to learn to read, so that some comrades in the cooking班 felt that they were making rapid progress. When someone was sick, everyone warmly comforted, cared for, and consoled them. Political work cadres often helped nurses fetch water, fetch food, carry urine pots, clean the wards, and carry luggage. When convalescents were newly admitted, all the staff concentrated on helping to change their dressings. The mutual assistance between the staff, especially the spirit of mutual assistance of the cadres and political work personnel, moved the lightly wounded soldiers to help the staff with a lot of administrative and party work, which later formed mutual assistance and self-governance among the convalescents. Initially, lightly wounded soldiers helped seriously wounded soldiers, and old convalescents helped newly admitted ones fetch water, fetch food, wash faces and feet, lead charcoal to make fires, and vacate empty rooms to welcome and transport them. Then, it went from mutual assistance in life to mutual assistance in thought. When convalescents had shortcomings, they would educate themselves without waiting for the staff to criticize them, which made the staff and convalescents more united and friendly, and慰勞ed each other (the staff once raised 24,000 yuan to慰勞 the wounded and sick soldiers, and the wounded and sick soldiers also launched large-scale慰勞 to the staff six times in the past year and a half, individually sending their beloved items and talking to the staff). The convalescents felt that leaving the staff was like leaving their relatives. Under such a spirit of unity and fraternity, the hospital staff all felt competent and happy.

    III. Encourage the Convalescents' Sense of Honor and Progress; Organize the Convalescents to "Manage Themselves"

    In the past, many staff members in No. 1 Hospital believed that hospital work could not be done well. Since adopting a set of methods to solve problems from the ideological and organizational aspects, all the difficult problems have been solved easily. The methods they adopted were:

    First, they learned that although some of the convalescents had a sense of achievement and did not obey management, they also learned that there were some party members, activists, and heroes and models among them who were willing to make progress. They first put forward the education of "one family," that hospitalization is not staying in a hotel, and introduced the hospital's situation and regulations. Then, they encouraged the convalescents to "study well," and proposed that fighting well and convalescing well are considered completely good. They encouraged activists and hero model comrades, "Heroes are fighting on the front line, and models are convalescing in the rear." The branch also asked party members to ensure that they recuperated in peace, guaranteed to abide by the hospital regulations, consolidated and encouraged morale. And announced to everyone that their good and bad performances during the recuperation period would be introduced to the original unit,促使ing everyone to consciously study well.

    Secondly, the convalescents were organized,编按rooms into班, and编按wards into排, the班排长was selected by the branch after deliberation and democratic selection, and the recuperating cadres were编组 separately. If the班排长was a party member, he was generally elected as the party group leader or branch committee member, so that the administrative and party organizations tended to be consistent and did not make the organization complicated.

    Then, a management committee of convalescents was democratically elected, which became the highest power organization for convalescents to manage themselves. Under the leadership of the branch, it was also consistent with the organization of the branch committee. On the one hand, it managed the convalescents, and on the other hand, it assisted the administrative and party work of the hospital. The hospital sent a deputy political instructor through the branch to realize the leadership of the convalescents, and he was also one of the members of the management committee.

    The management committee solved everyone's problems from the ideological aspect more than from the organizational aspect, and mostly influenced everyone with the exemplary behavior of the management committee members, party members, and activists, and used a democratic, reasonable, and patient persuasion attitude to deal with the problems among the convalescents. The management committee comrades班排长, were not only able to understand the mood of the convalescents themselves, but also understood some of the hospital's situations and difficulties, so they solved many difficult problems:

    1.  Persuade more from the perspective of the convalescents' own interests, "As long as we convalescents have a good attitude towards the staff, the staff will be better to us. Don't beat or scold the nurses, otherwise the nurses will not dare to come to the ward, and everyone will suffer."

    2.  Convalescents are prone to施下马威 when they are first admitted to the hospital. At this time, old convalescents and lightly recuperating people go to greet the newly admitted ones, warmly invite them, and give them warmth, which can often change the attitude of the new wounded soldiers. For example, when a排长 was transferred to a hospital, he came fiercely and was in an abnormal mood. Later, he was warmly greeted by convalescent排长 Jia Xiaotuo, who was attentive, even helping him wash his face and feet, and cover the quilt together at night. The moved排长 said, "Everyone is the same, I guess you came to recruit me." After the attitude of a排长 improved, he was given a critical conversation, "You were angry when you first came, which is not good for your wound. Our instructor was also injured and came down, so your attitude is not good!" A排长 accepted the criticism and later performed very well. Xin Xi, the logistics officer of the Twenty-third Regiment, came to treat scabies, and often went out to pick up waste炭 to ask everyone to bake scabies, and often persuaded everyone: "We can rest when we fight on the front line, but the nurses don't have a day off for 365 days a year."

    3.  Carry out mass criticism and self-criticism, and educate individuals with poor performance. For example, Jia Pijin, a liberated soldier from the Thirteenth Brigade, was caught and brought back after deserting. After deliberation, everyone criticized him for confessing his mistakes and made a guarantee that he would not desert in the future. Under the mass-loving ideological mutual assistance, Comrade Jia Xiaotuo dispelled a certain liberated soldier's fear of us, and consolidated a certain soldier who was about to desert. And the convalescents themselves uncovered the case of special agents disintegrating our army's soldiers deserting, automatically worked the night watch, strictly checked pedestrians, and brought back three deserters. Last year, in the anti-desertion, anti-gambling, and anti-theft and sale of public property and other bad tendencies, the convalescents solved many problems themselves, and finally made the convalescents' upright spirit rise, and even if there was still evil spirit, it could not grow.

    In short, since No. 1 Hospital has implemented the mass line, the leadership has appeared to have a way. The staff and convalescents are united, and the enthusiasm for work has also been highly developed. Since then, hospital work has also appeared to be very good, and significant results have been achieved. This experience proves that some comrades think that hospital work is difficult to do well, which is unfounded. (Political Department of the Military Region)

　　负伤战士有了家
  　介绍太岳军区野战医院一所政治工作
    太岳军区野战医院一所，原系太岳一分区三、五两所合并而成。去年春季，由于和平思想的影响，医院人员多要求复员转业、退伍回家。对工作采取敷衍了事，缺乏认真负责的精神。再则，有些休养员入院后多居功傲慢，甚至打骂工作人员，又增加了工作人员的不安和不满。由此产生某些同志的“报复”思想，认为休养员“调皮捣蛋”，只有整他一整才有办法，结果关系更坏，工作更难做，后来经过一所的党、干部，全体同志研究了休养员与工作人员思想状况，领导上首先着重检查自己，认为基本原因是工作人员“为休养员服务”的思想不明确，经改变后取得空前成绩：（一）休养员百分之九十九·三四归队（除残废外）。（二）伤病员死亡率在重伤病员入院较多的条件下，从百分之五减少到百分之二·八。（三）工作员全年无逃亡。其主要经验为：
    一、明确树立“为休养员服务”的思想提高工作人员的责任心和积极性
    整顿工休人员关系开始是由所方布置召开了工休人员座谈会，着重自我检讨批评，说明过去“为休养员服务”精神不够，要休养员提出意见。休养员在这种精神感动之下，亦检讨了自己的不对，并提出一些改善工作的意见。从此关系确实改善了不少，使工作人员切实感到：“只要自己关心休养员，不怕别人不说理，还是怪自己为休养员服务不好”。情绪渐趋安定。一所的党委根据当时群众的情绪，又经过支部与群众酝酿，发动了全所“为休养员服务”的学习和竞赛运动，个人都订出了竞赛计划，领导上又归纳成模范看护员、模范炊事员的条件。去夏进入政治整训，学习了时事，“和平”思想影响下的不良倾向，得到清理和克服；如炊事班同志说：“我工作积极，因为我认识到蒋介石是干啥吃的”。对个别有错不改问题较严重的，则进行群众批评会，并受到了处分。又表扬了模范工作者，大家都向好的学，正如医助赵东治说：“这个所里不容易有坏人”。
    在这样思想基础上，大家具体分析研究了休养员的心理思想状况，提出应该任劳任怨，耐烦解释，体贴安慰。个人和部门都订出工作计划；如炊事班一人要做将近三十个人的饭，还要保证了伙食调剂；如大锅一米一面，每人每天一斤菜、十二两豆腐、三两粉条，每三天一次肉（七两），特锅鸡汤、蛋汤、油茶、饺子，小锅四天内不吃重饭。这样繁重任务，炊事班并无怨言，且恐怕不合口味与营养，经常的病房征求意见；如炊事班长高建章同志有一天坐在×休养员床边，将各种有营养的吃食提出来征求该休养员意见，该休养员开始不想吃，老高同志放不下心，仍很恳切的询问究竟想吃啥，该伤员才说：“怕你麻烦，我想吃山药蛋米汤”。高同志很快回厨房做好端去。一所认识休养员的伙食是个非常重要的问题，专门组织了生活研究小组，十天开一次会，有主治医生、政指、事务长、炊事班长、管理委员会主任、调剂委员（后两个是休养员中选出）参加，具体的研究办法，求得休养员的伙食既合乎他们的口味，又合乎医生的规定。
    医生看护员同志专门组织了技术研究会，联系过去实际经验，进行对新治疗法的学习，培养出十七个技术较高的看护员，一面研究，一面进行治疗，减少休养员不少痛苦。还规定看护员每天向医生汇报伤病员病势、心理态度、饮食便尿情况，使医生能熟悉状况对症下药。因此好多休养员都非常感激。医生与休养员情感上取得了融洽。看护员每人招呼了十五个以上伤病员，日夜不休，有时挨打骂还很好的去解释，如看护王月英为劝×休养员（连长）不吃零食而被打骂，但看护员同志都能体谅休养员：“因为有了痛苦，容易发躁”。
    二、发扬团结友爱精神实行大互助
    由于大家一心要把工作做好，工作人员达到空前团结，高度发扬了阶级友爱互助精神，这又使工作人员的积极性更加发挥。炊事班每人工作计划中有帮助看护员的项目，帮助看护员打水到病室。炊事员刘建业、萧万士每天到病房拿上休养员几件衣服抽空帮洗，有时帮助值夜。看护班帮助炊事班挑水做饭，帮助识字，使炊事班有些同志感觉自己进步快了。有人病了，大家热烈的去安慰照顾慰劳。政工干部经常帮看护员打水、打饭、端提尿盆、打扫病房、搬运行李。当休养员刚入院时全体工作人员集中帮助换药，工作人员之间的互助，尤其是干部政工人员的互助精神，感动了轻伤员帮助工作人员做了不少行政与党的工作，后来形成休养员互助自治，开始是轻伤员帮助重伤员，老休养员帮助新入院者打水打饭，洗脸洗脚，领炭生火，腾出空房，迎接搬运。接着就由生活上的互助到思想上的互助，休养员有了缺点，不待工作人员去批评，他们自己就进行了教育，这就使得工作人员与休养员之间更加团结友爱，互相慰劳（工作人员曾有一次集款二万四千元慰劳伤病员，伤病员去年大半年也发动大的慰劳工作人员六次，个别的送自己心爱物、找工作人员谈心）。使休养员感到离开了工作人员，好象离开了亲人一样。在这样团结友爱的精神下，医院工作人员都感到胜任愉快。
    三、鼓励休养员荣誉心和前进心　组织休养员“自己管理自己”
    过去一所许多工作人员，都认为医院工作是无法作好的。自从采取了从思想上组织上去解决问题的一套办法之后，一切难解决的问题都迎刃而解了。他们采取的办法是：
    首先了解了休养员中虽有居功思想，不服管理；同时也了解到其中有一部分党员积极分子和英雄模范，这些同志是愿意上进的，即先提出：“一家人”的教育，住院不是住店，介绍院方情况与院规，然后鼓励休养员“学好”，提出打仗好、休养好才算完全好。鼓励积极分子英模同志，“前方打仗是英雄，后方休养是模范”。支部又要求党员保证安心休养，保证遵守院规，巩固与鼓舞情绪。并且向大家宣布，在休养期间好坏表现，都向原部队介绍，促使大家自觉学好。
    其次将休养员组织起来，按室编班，按院编排，班排长由支部研究酝酿田民主选出，把休养的干部另行编组。班排长如是党员，一般被选为党的小组长、支委，使行政与党的组织趋于一致，不使组织庞杂。
    接着便民主产生休养员的管理委员会，成为休养员自己管理自己的最高权力组织，在支分部领导下，又与支分部委员会组织一致，一方面管理休养员，另方面又协助所部行政与党的工作，所部派副政指经过支部去实现对休养员的领导，他也是管委会委员之一。
    管委会从思想上解决大家问题，多于从组织上解决问题，多半从管委会委员、党员积极分子的模范行为去影响大家，用民主评理，耐心说服的态度去处理休养员中的问题。管委会同志班排长，既能体贴休养员本身的心情，又会谅解医院某些情况与困难，所以他们解决了好多难以解决的问题：
    １、多从休养员利害关系去劝说“只要我们休养员对工作人员态度好，工作人员会对我们更好。不要打骂看护员，否则看护员会不敢来病室，反苦了大家。”
    ２、休养员初入院容易施下马威，此时由老休养员、轻休养员去招呼初入院的，殷勤招待，给以温暖，往往可以改变新伤员的态度。如某排长转院到一所时，来势凶凶，心情反常，后由休养员排长贾小脱同志热忱招呼的，无微不至，甚至帮助洗脸洗足，晚上合盖被子。感动的某排长说：“大家都是一样，想必你来招护呢。”待某排长态度好转后，对他进行带批评性的谈话：“你初来时就生气，对你伤口多不好，我们指导员也是负伤下来的，这样的招呼你，你的态度可不好呀！”某排长接受了批评，后来表现甚好。二十三团事务长辛喜同志是来治疥的，经常外出拾废炭要大家烤疥，经常劝导大家：“我们在前方打仗还可休息，人家看护员一年三百六十五天是没有一天闲着的。”
    ３、开展群众性的批评与自我批评，对个别表现较差的，进行教育。如十三旅一个被解放战士贾丕金开小差被发觉抓回来，经过酝酿，由大家批评他坦白认错，并提出保证今后不开小差。在群众热爱的思想互助下，贾小脱同志解除某解放战士对我们害怕的疑团，巩固了某一个将开小差的战士。并由休养员自己破获特务瓦解我军战士开小差的案件，自动值夜放哨，严格盘查行人，捉回三个逃兵。去年在反逃亡，反赌博，反盗卖公物等不良倾向中，休养员自己解决了不少问题，终于使休养员正气上升，邪气即使还有，亦不能滋长。
    总之，一所的政治工作自从实行了群众路线，领导上就显得有办法。工作人员与休养员就团结一起，工作的积极性亦高度发挥了。从此医院工作亦显得非常好做，并取得了很显著的成绩。这个经验可以证明有些同志认为医院工作很难作好，是毫无根据的。（军区政治部）
