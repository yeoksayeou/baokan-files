　　Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 7th. The Northeast Democratic Allied Army has launched a large-scale military training and technical study campaign. Turned-over peasants from various regions, who joined the Democratic Allied Army after the summer offensive, have made rapid technical progress during the training. In a certain unit's machine gun company, more than half of the new soldiers can now throw grenades beyond 35 meters. Zhou Wuren, a new soldier from a certain company who only participated in combat for eleven days, scored twenty-seven rings with three consecutive shots in live ammunition shooting, earning high praise. A certain unit has been practicing siege tactics, attacking bunkers, diligently and assiduously, making great progress. In a certain company of this unit, the time required to blast through four obstacles at a distance of eighty meters was initially eleven and a half minutes, but now it only takes one minute and three seconds, setting a new record. Furthermore, another unit of the Democratic Allied Army has issued a "Call to Promote Technical Study," urging "everyone to come up with ideas and everyone to think of solutions" to further master various modern tactics. They are organizing the large number of technically skilled soldiers and talented commanders in the army to conduct research and improve technology. Currently, this unit has organized various talents into groups and established a research committee to launch a technical study campaign.
