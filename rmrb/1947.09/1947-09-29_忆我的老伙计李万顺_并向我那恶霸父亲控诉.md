    Remembering My Old Mate Li Wanshun
    And Accusing My Bully Father

    My old mate Li Wanshun, never had a good life. He started working as a long-term laborer for my family at the age of thirty-nine, and he worked for forty years, until he was in his seventies, literally worked to death!

    I don't know what year of the Guangxu reign it was, but because the times were bad, my father saw that he was desperately poor and took the opportunity to grab him, agreeing that he would work as a long-term laborer for my family. The amount of wages was never mentioned; it was enough to keep him from starving. For the first few years, he would still give him seven or eight strings of cash a year, then five or six strings, three or four strings, less and less each year. Later, it slowly disappeared. My father didn't say he would give it, and he didn't dare ask for it. Until he died, he endured forty years of hardship in vain.

    Speaking of my father, he was a notorious "evil man" in the local area. As they say, "One stomp of his foot shakes all four streets." Everyone was afraid of him. He acted recklessly in the village, hitting whoever he wanted and scolding whoever he wanted. Out of the thousands of people in the village, you couldn't find many who hadn't been beaten or scolded by him. If anyone resisted, he would wield knives and guns. If he couldn't win in a private fight, he would see you in court, spending a few coins at the yamen gate to have people arrested. As for his "slave" Li Wanshun, that goes without saying.

    Li Wanshun suffered all kinds of abuse from my father throughout his life. I remember the black welts from whippings on his skinny body, and the hard lumps from being hit with wooden sticks on his graying head. These were all painful marks etched on him by my father. In these forty years of animal-like existence, he was kicked and beaten every day, with few days off in the year. If the courtyard wasn't swept clean today, he would be beaten; if he didn't hear a summons tomorrow, he would be beaten. Out of 360 days a year, there were very few days when he wasn't. Especially in the later years, my father beat him particularly hard, and his scolding was particularly harsh. He would say aggressively, "If you don't work, get out!" Li Wanshun had thought about "getting out," but when he wanted to "get out" in the first twenty years, my father demanded that he repay the "getting out money" (money for food eaten, work missed, etc., but he didn't give him any of the wages he should have earned). So he didn't dare "get out." These years, his beard had turned completely white, and his back was bent! In this way, he endured day after day, year after year, until he died.

    Although Li Wanshun labored like an ox and endured my father's abuse, he loved us brothers as if we were his own sons. My mother had many children and couldn't take care of them all, so I grew up with Li Wanshun. He would take me during the day, and he would hold me to sleep at night. He took care of me when I pooped and peed. He spent the few coins he had saved up over the years on me. I remember when I was a child, when I woke up crying in the middle of the night every day, he would always take some peanuts and candy from under his pillow and put them in my hands. More than ten years passed, and I grew up, but his tragic situation remained unchanged.

    Last year in Fengzhen, I received a letter from a friend saying that he had died six years ago. My father spent five yuan to buy a thin wooden coffin and buried him in the paupers' graveyard. What was my father's heart made of?! The hearts of landlords are too cruel! After reading the letter, I pondered for a long time. I felt that such tragedies were not limited to this one case. I want to seek justice for Li Wanshun! I want to avenge the many oppressed working people in the world!

    Last year, I sent a letter to the masses in the village, saying that the affairs of the family should be handled entirely by the masses. However the masses want to handle it, I raise both hands in sincere support! In particular, the forty-year deep hatred of Li Wanshun must be avenged! The forty years of wages must be fully taken out, and my family must sweep the tomb and offer sacrifices to Li Wanshun's spirit every festival. As for whether my father should be killed or skinned, it is all up to the masses to decide. (Reprinted from Jin Sui Daily)

    忆我的老伙计李万顺
    并向我那恶霸父亲控诉
    老伙计李万顺，一辈子没好活过，他从三十九岁上就到我家抗长活，一直抗了四十年，抗到七十几岁，活活地抗死了！
    不知是光绪几年来，因为年头不好，我父亲看见他穷的要死，就乘机抓了一把，应下他给我家抗长活，工钱多少根本没提，只管他一碗饭饿不死他就算了。开头几年，每年还给他个七吊八吊的，以后五吊六吊，三吊四吊，一年比一年少，后来慢慢地没有了，我父亲不说给，他也不敢要，一直到他死，整整四十年的苦，算白白地受过去了。
    提起我父亲本是当地出名的“恶人”，所谓：“一跺脚四街动”，人人都怕，在村里胡作非为，愿意打谁就打谁，愿意骂谁就骂谁，全村几千口人，没有受过他打骂的找不出几个来，谁要反抗，就耍刀子动枪，私场打不赢，官场上见，往衙门口花上几个钱，就把人押起来。对于自己的“奴隶”李万顺，那就更不消说了。
    李伙计一辈子受尽了我父亲的虐待，我记得在他枯瘦的身上有皮鞭抽打的黑道子，在他苍白发的头上，有木棒打下的硬圪＠，这都是我父亲给他刻下的痛苦的痕迹。在这四十年的牛马生活中，一天假被踢过来打过去，今天院子没扫净也挨打，明天呼唤没听见也挨打，一年三百六十天，很少有几天空过去。特别后几年我父亲打他特别狠，骂也特别刺耳，一开口就气势汹汹地说：“你不干，你滚蛋！”李伙计也曾经想“滚”过，可是当在前廿年要“滚”的时候，因为我父亲要他偿还“滚钱”（吃的饭钱，误下的工钱等，但他应赚的工钱却一点不给）。所以没敢“滚”。这些年满脸胡子都苍白了。腰也弯下了！就这样，一天天的忍，一年年的受，一直忍受到死。
    李伙计虽象牛马一样地劳动，并受着我父亲的虐待，但他对我们弟兄都象对自己的儿子那样痛爱。我母亲孩子多，照顾不来，所以我从小就是跟着李伙计长大的；白天他引上我要，夜里他抱着我睡，拉屎撒尿都是他一手照管，他把他多年积攒下的几个钱都为我花费了，记得我小时每天半夜里醒来哭叫的时候，他总是从他枕头底下掏些花生、糖塞在我的手里，十几年过去了，我长大了，而他的悲惨的境遇仍然没有改变。
    去年在丰镇，接到朋友的来信，说他在前六年就死去了，我父亲花了五块钱买了口薄木棺材把他葬在乱人坟里。我父亲的心是怎样长的？！地主的心肠太残忍了！我看完信，沉思了半天，我觉得这样的惨事绝不止这一件，我要为李伙计伸冤！我要为世上许多被压迫的劳动人民报仇！
    去年我已给村里的群众去了信，家的事完全由群众处理，怎样处理怎样是，我举两只手竭诚拥护！特别是李伙计四十年的深仇要报！四十年的工钱要完全拿出来，并且每逢节日由我家的人给李伙计扫墓祭灵，至于我父亲该杀该刮全由群众发落。（转载晋绥日报）
