Gaoyi Cadres Take the Lead in Overcoming Famine
Saving Cotton Clothing to Reduce the People's Burden

[This newspaper's Gaoyi dispatch] Responding to the call to overcome famine and determined to be good oxen for the masses, Gaoyi cadres have launched a movement to support the front lines by saving food and clothing. All 70 comrades of the county government are each saving half a set of cotton clothing and all vegetable money, plus half a jin of rice. Each person is collecting two jin of dried wild vegetables (some have already exceeded this amount), and collectively reclaiming 70 mu of wasteland, preparing to plant wheat (already plowed twice). In terms of daily life, they are exchanging rice and wheat for sorghum (now eating white flour once a week). In terms of individual production, some are helping each other spin cotton, and others are rushing to repair ginning machines to prepare for ginning cotton, planting small plots of land, etc. Everyone guarantees to achieve self-reliance during the famine, save one person's life, not increase the burden on the masses, and be a good ox for the masses. More than 40 cadres from the first and fourth districts (党政民武：Party, government, civilian, and military) are saving all their cotton clothing and vegetable money to support the front lines. The fourth district will not spend public grain from October onwards, and will solve the problem through self-sufficiency through production. In order to increase production enthusiasm, a two-eight profit sharing system has been established. All cadres in the first and fourth districts have set production plans, with each person reclaiming half a mu to one mu of wasteland, preparing to plant wheat. In order to combine production with work, those with more than three people at fixed bases now cook their own meals, not troubling the masses. In the future, the base will be the unit, mastering the plan, and comparing work, comparing production, and being a good ox for the masses will be regarded as a meritorious service regulation. Everyone is very enthusiastic and vying to be a good ox for the masses.

[This newspaper's Yushe dispatch] Since the call to save and overcome famine was put forward, teachers in this county have actively responded. Starting in August, various high primary schools and school districts have discussed saving and overcoming famine. In addition to organizing students to reclaim wasteland, plant autumn vegetables, and search for wild vegetables, high primary school principals and teachers, in order to defeat the disaster, reduce the burden on the people, overcome the current difficulties, and ensure supplies to the front lines by digging out old roots, have voluntarily proposed salary reductions to save and lower the standard of living. A total of 142 high primary school principals and teachers are reducing the amount of salary rice received from the masses by a total of 2,408 jin per month. Some started in August, and some started in September. More than ten teachers and principals have also reported the savings of their seniority pay. If this salary reduction is calculated on a half-year basis, the people of Yushe will pay 14,848 jin less rice (equivalent to more than 80 shi).

    节约棉衣减轻民负
    【本报高邑讯】响应渡荒号召，决心给群众当好牛，高邑干部开展了支援前线节约衣食运动。县政府全体同志七十名，每人节约半套棉衣及全部菜金米半斤，每人打二斤干野菜（现在有的已超过），集体开荒七十亩，准备种麦（现已耕了二遍）。生活上把米麦换成高粮吃（现在一星期吃一顿白面），个人生产上有的互助纺花，有的赶修轧车准备轧花，种小块地等，大家保证在灾荒中作到自立更生，并救活一个人，不加重群众负担，做群众一个好牛。一、四两区党政民武四十余名干部节约全部棉衣菜金，支援前线。四区从十月份起不开支公粮，由生产自给解决，为了提高生产情绪，又规定了二八分红制，一、四区全体干部均定出生产计划，每人开荒半亩到一亩，准备种麦。为使生产与工作结合，现在固定基点三人以上者自己做饭，不麻烦群众，今后以基点为单位，掌握计划，把比工作、比生产、给群众当一个好牛作为立功条例，大家情绪很高，争相给群众做好牛。
