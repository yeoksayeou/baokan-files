　　Guerrillas Active in the Suburbs
　　Chiang's Army in Yan'an Disturbed Day and Night

Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 5th—People's guerrilla warfare is raging around Yan'an. Soldiers of the 6th Company of the 14th Heavy Artillery Regiment of Chiang's army, isolated in Dongguan Qingliang Mountain, are in constant panic, and more than 50 have already deserted. In the second half of August, guerrillas in the Fengfu District north of Yan'an annihilated a squad of Chiang's army on the Yan'an-Suide highway. Guerrillas south of Yan'an annihilated a security post of the enemy. Guerrillas in Yanchuan, east of Yan'an, fought an average of once a day for ten days. A total of 31 Chiang's soldiers were captured alive, and another 19 were killed or wounded. During the same period, the guerrillas damaged highways, bridges, and power lines many times, making the rear traffic of Chiang's army, which was deeply trapped north of Suide, extremely difficult.

　　游击队活跃近郊
  　延安蒋军日夜不安
    【新华社西北五日电】延安周围燃遍人民游击战火。孤悬东关清凉山的蒋军重炮第十四团第六连士兵，日夜惶惶不安，已逃跑了五十多人。在八月下半月，延安以北丰富区游击队在延（安）绥（德）公路上歼蒋军一个班，延安以南游击队歼敌保安所一处，延安以东延川游击队在十天内平均每天作战一次，各地共活捉蒋军三十一名，另毙伤其十九名，在同期间，各游击队破坏公路、桥梁及电线多次，使深陷绥德以北的蒋军后方交通极感困难。
