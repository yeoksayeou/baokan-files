Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st: New York - Major characteristics of an economic crisis – declining production – are rapidly maturing in the United States. According to statistics from the US Department of Labor, the production index for July has fallen to 178 (based on the 1935-39 average as 100, with the highest index in March of this year being 190), marking the fourth consecutive month of production decline. It is noteworthy that the production decline is accelerating. March saw a 4% drop compared to April, May saw a 5% drop, June saw a 7% drop, and July saw a more drastic 12% drop. Machine production and non-ferrous metal production have declined successively. Textile production has suddenly fallen to its lowest level since December 1945. "US News" magazine, commenting on the production decline in the second quarter of this year, stated: "A comparison of prices and production reveals the weakness of the boom, as the so-called boom is merely a rise in prices." The magazine darkly stated that the real test of the "price boom" will occur before the end of this year. Exports supporting the boom have passed their peak and fundamentally declined in June. The "price boom" continues to deplete domestic purchasing power. The magazine concludes: "Considering various factors, the boom can no longer be sustained, and it will likely decline from now on."

　　经济危机特征日益显露
  　美国生产加速跌落
    【新华社陕北一日电】纽约讯：经济危机的主要特征——生产跌落正在美国迅速成熟中。据美劳工部统计，七月份生产指数已跌至一七八（按此系以三五至三九年的平均数为一百计算，今年三月最高指数为一九○），为生产连续下跌之第四个月。值得注意者，为生产之跌落，在加速进行，三月份比较四月份跌百分之四、五月份跌百分之五，六月份跌百分之七，七月份更惨跌百分之十二。机器生产，非铁金属生产等均相继下落，纺织品之生产已突然跌至四五年十二月以来的最低水平。“美国新闻”周刊在评论今年第二季的生产下降时说：“将物价与生产作一比较，即暴露出景气的弱点，因为所谓景气不过是物价上涨而已。”该刊暗淡地称，“物价景气”的真正考验将在今年年底以前发生。支持景气的输出已越过顶点而在六月根本下降。“物价景气”继续使国内购买力凋敝。该刊结论称：“考察各种因素，景气已不能再维持，今后恐怕要走下坡路了。”
