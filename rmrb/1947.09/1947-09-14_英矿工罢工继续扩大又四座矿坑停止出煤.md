Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, September 11th: London dispatch: The strike of 60,000 miners in South Yorkshire, England, has spread to West Yorkshire, where four mines stopped coal production on the 8th. A Ministry of Commerce spokesperson stated on the 5th that even if the 60,000 miners in Yorkshire immediately returned to work, it would be too late to prevent many textile and machine factories from closing for two or three days each week. Although the Labor government has been trying its best to demand and threaten the workers to return to work, it is still to no avail. According to an Associated Press report, although workers in all the strike areas held a meeting on the 5th to consider the issue of returning to work, every participant only said, "This time, we firmly support Grimethorpe." (Note: Grimethorpe mine was the first to start this major strike.) They also stated that they could not dig extra coal for two days a day as required by the National Coal Board. Furthermore, according to British official statistics released on the 10th, due to the strike, Britain lost 327,000 tons of coal last week (August 31st to September 7th). This figure is more than 10 percent of England's usual total output.

　　英矿工罢工继续扩大又四座矿坑停止出煤
    【新华社陕北十一日电】伦敦讯：英约克郡南部六万矿工的罢工，已波及约克郡西部，该地四座矿坑于八日起停止出煤。商务部发言人五日曾称：即使约克郡六万矿工立即复工，要使很多纺织及机器工厂不致每周关门两三天，已为期过晚。工党政府虽竭力要求并威胁工人复工，但仍无济于事。据美联社讯，五日全部罢工区域工人虽曾举行会议考虑复工问题，但与会的每一个工人都只说：“这一次坚决支持格林姆索波尔。”（按格林姆索波尔矿坑为此次大罢工之首发者）并称：他们不能如全国煤业局所要求的每日额外挖煤两天。又：据十日公布的英国官方统计，由于罢工结果，上星期（八月三十一日到七日）英国所损失的煤炭达三十二万七千吨，这数字较英格兰通常总产量百分之十还多。
