    Yangyi Military Dependents Write to Encourage Sons Going to War:
    Down with Chiang Kai-shek, Return Home Victorious!
    [Our Dispatch] Hearing the news of the People's Liberation Army's great counter-offensive, everyone in Yangyi Town, Wu'an who had suffered under the traitor Chiang Kai-shek was overjoyed, and the families of the soldiers at the front were especially happy. Because the counter-offensive, victory, and reunion with loved ones were closely linked. Therefore, among the batch of letters from military dependents to the front-line troops received by the Yangyi Town government these past few days, almost every one had phrases like "Down with Chiang Kai-shek before returning home." In people's minds, Chiang and the American imperialists and Wang Jingwei were exactly the same, and only by overthrowing Chiang Kai-shek could they enjoy peace.
    The nineteen-year-old fiancée of An Yuzhu, a soldier from the East Street, had her family repeatedly notify Da Zhu's father, An San, to ask him to quickly call Yuzhu back to get married. An San sent a letter to Yuzhu on the 17th of this month explaining this matter. The next day, news of the great counter-offensive came, and he immediately consulted with his daughter-in-law and wrote another letter saying: "The woman I mentioned to you before is also very healthy. She was very happy when she heard the news of the great counter-offensive, and told you to defeat Chiang Kai-shek before coming back to get married."
    Lu Rong, a forty-nine-year-old military dependent from West Street, was extremely strong-willed. Eight years ago, he sent his eighteen-year-old son, Lu Xian, to join the army, and he has had no news since, nor does he inquire. When rumors in the street said that his son had probably already sacrificed himself, he simply pretended not to hear them. He said, "Since I sent him to join the army, I have this firm determination, and I don't care whether he lives or dies." This spring, after completely overturning the old order, he became even more resolute. On the 18th, when he heard the news of the great counter-offensive, he put down the dinner he was holding and inquired all over the street. From other military dependents, he learned that Lu Xian had previously joined the 385th Brigade, 14th Regiment, and was worried that it had been reorganized. So he immediately found someone to write a letter to the military region headquarters saying: "I hope you will take the trouble to check. If Lu Xian is still alive, tell him to quickly write a letter back. And tell him: the family has now been allocated two and a half mu of good land, a total of eighteen mu, which is enough to eat. The six broken houses have also been replaced by twelve good houses, which are very spacious. The village cadres and the masses treat us very well, and his second and third younger brothers and I can all work, so there is no financial difficulty at all. There is no need to worry about anything. Tell him to fight hard in the great counter-offensive outside, defeat Chiang Kai-shek, and then come home."
    Du Yuanming, a fifty-seven-year-old man, had his wife starve to death before the "July 7th" Incident, and he would shed tears whenever he talked about it. Not long after the Eighth Route Army arrived in Yangyi, he personally sent his eldest son, Du Shuntian, to join the army. Last winter, he finally turned things around, and this spring he sent his second son to join the army. A daughter who could cook and sew for him was also married off, leaving only a twelve-year-old third son with him. Although the masses "supported" his family with more than a dozen houses, ten mu of land, and a donkey, and he felt very prosperous and glorious, he was inevitably sad at times because he was nearly sixty and his sons were not yet married. The day before he heard the news of the great counter-offensive, he had just written a letter to his eldest son saying: "I don't worry about anything about you being away from home, but not getting you a wife is always a weight on my heart." Hearing about the great counter-offensive, he immediately realized the mistake in this letter: "My son is on the front line of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia border region engaged in the great counter-offensive, and writing such a letter will make him anxious!" So he immediately ran to the post office, wanting to retrieve the letter. But it was too late, the letter had already left. He immediately wrote another letter saying: "I heard that you were very active in production and combat before and received rewards from superiors (a message from my son's last visit). In the future, you should actively participate in the great counter-offensive, defeat Chiang Kai-shek, eliminate the great scourge for the people, make great contributions, and come back victorious." He also wrote in detail about the family's turnaround, telling his son not to worry at all. He said, "When my son sees how determined his father is, he will feel at ease."
    To encourage his third son, Dou Dexing, to concentrate on the great counter-offensive at the front, forty-eight-year-old Dou Jinxiu, in addition to reporting that the bad land at home had been replaced with good land and other changes, also specially reported to him that "your elder brother used to smoke opium, but now he has reformed and found a twenty-two-year-old partner, opened a steamed bun shop, and your mother and I have no worries." He concluded by saying: "If the Eighth Route Army hadn't come, your brother couldn't have changed; if you hadn't joined the army, our family wouldn't have received so many preferential treatments. You must fight hard in the counter-offensive outside!"
    Fifty-year-old Guo Mingchen wrote to his son Guo Dongyuan, telling him that "the family has been allocated another three mu of top-quality land and added six good houses this spring," and then specially asked the scribe to note a sentence: "These houses and land all belonged to Meng Xiangqi's family." Because Meng was a local tyrant and landlord who had used high-interest loans to swindle the family of its only six mu of land, his family had lived in a land temple for three years because of this, his children had to work as long-term laborers, and he himself worked short-term jobs for others, until the Eighth Route Army came to reclaim this six mu of land. Now, mentioning that the newly allocated houses and land all belonged to Meng's family, his son would naturally be especially happy and fight even harder. (Er Dong)

    阳邑军属函勉出征子弟
    打倒蒋介石
    胜利再回家
    【本报讯】听到人民解放军大反攻的消息，武安阳邑镇上一切受过卖国贼蒋介石灾害的人都高兴，前方将士的家属们更是格外高兴。因为反攻、胜利和骨肉团圆紧紧联结着。所以阳邑镇公所这几日收到的一批批发往前方部队的军属信件中，几乎每一件都有“打倒蒋介石再回家”之类的语句。在人们心目中，蒋美和汪是一模一样的东西，只有打倒蒋介石才能享太平。
    东街出征军人安玉柱的未婚妻，年已十九，家里一再通知大柱的父安三，请他赶快叫玉柱回来完婚。安三即于本月十七日给玉柱发信说明此事。次日，大反攻消息传来了，他马上商得儿媳同意，又写一信说：“以前给你说的媳妇，她身体也很健壮，她听到大反攻消息很高兴，叫你打倒蒋介石再回来结婚。”
    西街四十九岁的军属吕荣，性子极刚强。八年前送他十八岁的儿子吕贤出去参了军，至今没有音信，也不查问。街上风言风语说他儿子大概早牺牲了，他也只当没听见。他说：“我既叫他参军，我就有这坚决心，死活我不在乎。”今春彻底翻身，就更坚决了。十八号听到大反攻的消息，他却放下端在手里的晚饭，满街打听起来。从别的军属口中探悉吕贤以前参加的是三八五旅十四团，又怕已经改编。于是马上找人写了一封信给军区司令部说：“希望你们费心给查一下，如果吕贤还在人世，就叫他赶快写封信回来。并且告诉他：家里现在又分到二亩半好地，一共十八亩了，满够吃了。六间破房也换成了十二间好房，住着很宽绰。村里干部群众待俺很好，我和他二弟三弟又都能劳动，生活上没一点困难，什么也不用结记，叫他在外好好大反攻，打倒蒋介石再回家。”
    杜元明，一个五十七岁的老头。“七七”以前老婆子就饿死了，一说起来就要掉泪。八路军到阳邑不久，就亲送大儿杜顺天参了军。去冬才翻身，今春又送二儿参了军。一个能替他做饭缝洗的女儿也出嫁了，跟前只有十二岁一个三子。虽然群众“拥护”家里十几间房，十来亩地，一个驴，生活很丰裕，自己也觉得过得很光荣。但因年近花甲，儿子均未成亲，不免有时难过。听到大反攻消息的前一日，他刚刚给他大儿写了封信说：“你在外我什么也不结记，就是没给你娶个媳妇，总是块心病。”听说大反攻，他马上觉察了这封信的错误：“我儿正在陕甘宁前线大反攻，写这样信他该不心焦哩！”于是立即跑到邮局，想索回此信。可是晚了，信已走了。他马上另写一信说：“听说以前生产作战都很积极，得到上级奖赏（儿子上次来的口信），以后更要积极参加大反攻，打倒蒋介石，为人民除大害、立大功、胜利了再回来。”又把家里翻身情形详细写上，叫儿子一点不用挂念。他说：“孩子见爹这样坚决，他就安心了。”
    四十八岁的窦锦秀为鼓励他三儿子窦德兴在前线安心大反攻，除报告家里坏地都换成好地等翻身情形外，并特别报告他“你大哥以前吸料面，现在已改邪归正，又结了个二十二岁的对象，闹了个蒸馍铺，我和你娘心里一点没忧愁了。”结语说：“要不是八路军来，你哥可也改不了；要不是你参军，咱家也受不上这么多优待。你在外可要好好反攻哩！”
    五十岁的郭明辰写信告诉他儿子郭东元“家里今春又分了三亩上好地，添了六间好房”以后，特别叫代笔者注明一句：“这房地都是孟祥麒家的。”因为孟是以前用高利贷讹光他仅有的六亩地的恶霸地主，他家曾因此到土地庙住过三年，孩子出外住长工，自己给人家打短工，一直到八路军来才夺回这六亩地。现在一提到新分房地都是孟家的，儿子自然格外痛快，打得更有劲了。（而东）
