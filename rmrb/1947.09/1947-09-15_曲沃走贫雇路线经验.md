　　Taiyue, 12th (Our Newspaper) The land reform movement in Quwo has created the experience of following the poor and hired peasant line. This experience is now being used to promote a comprehensive movement: (1) Cleanse the bad elements from the village cadres, so that the poor and hired peasants dare to rise up. For example, the village chief of Guocun drank wine at the landlord's house, which affected the masses' reluctance to act. The Pingwang village office even gave travel permits to landlords, allowing them to escape. Only after the removal of dissenting elements from the village cadres did the movement develop. When Beizhao village initially mobilized the poor and hired peasants, everyone was afraid of being shot in the back by special agents. Later, it was discovered that the village office secretary was a henchman of the special agents, constantly threatening the masses. He was immediately detained, and only then did the poor and hired peasants dare to approach the cadres and boldly rise up in struggle, using them as the backbone to unite all the poor people in the village. Thirteen villages in the Third District unanimously demanded the removal of bad elements from the village cadres. (2) The poor peasants are the bones, the middle peasants are the flesh. The poor and hired peasant backbone must unite with the middle peasants and struggle together. As the county-wide movement began to deepen, differences of opinion arose between the poor and hired peasants and the middle peasants in many villages. The middle peasants said, "The landlords have been beaten, swept out the door, and it's much worse than last year, so we can stop the struggle." But the poor peasants said, "The landlords still have hidden wealth, their prestige hasn't been beaten down, and on the surface we've divided some things, but in reality we're much worse off than the middle peasants!" In this situation, Fangcheng and Shangchen villages did a better job. All issues were first discussed and passed by the poor and hired peasant小组, and then meetings were held with the middle peasants to study together, and then the poor and hired peasants met again to discuss in order to get through to the middle peasants' thinking. For example, Zhao Heng, a landlord in Fangcheng, was a college student who was often away from home and was amiable, so the middle peasants thought he was a good person and were unwilling to struggle against him. But the poor peasants firmly said, "If his father didn't exploit people, how could he have gone to college? Now that his father is dead, the property he manages is all our blood and sweat, how can we not struggle against him?" Only in this way was the thinking of the middle peasants broken through, and the struggle unfolded.

　　曲沃走贫雇路线经验
    【本报太岳十二日电】曲沃土改运动中，创造走贫雇路线经验。现正以此种经验，推进全面运动：（一）清洗村干部中的坏分子，贫雇才敢起来。如郭村村长在地主家喝酒，影响了群众不敢动。平望村公所。更给地主开路条，让其逃跑。清洗了村干部中的异己分子，运动才发展起来。北赵村开始发动贫雇时，大家都怕特务打黑枪，后来才发现村公所书记是特务爪牙，时常威胁群众，当即将其扣起，贫雇才敢接近干部，大胆的起来斗争，并以他们为骨干，联络了全村的苦人。三区十三个村庄，一致要求清洗村干部中的坏分子。（二）贫农是骨，中农是肉，贫雇骨干，必须团结中农、一块斗争。当全县运动开始走向深入之际，许多村庄贫雇与中农意见发生分歧，中农说：“地主也打了，扫地出门了，比去年厉害的多了，可以停止斗争了”。而贫农则说：“地主还有内财，威风还没打下去，表面上我们分了些东西，实际上比中农差得很远！”在此种情况下，方城与上陈村，是作的较好的。他们一切问题，均先经贫雇小组讨论通过，然后再与中农开会共同研究，贫雇再开会讨论，以打通中农思想。如方城地主赵恒，是个大学生，过去经常在外，对人和气，中农便认为他是好人，不愿斗争。而贫农却坚决的说：“他父亲不剥削人，他如何能念起大学，现在他父亲死了，他所经管的财产，都是咱们的血汗，怎么不该斗？”这样才打通中农的思想，展开了斗争。
