　　It's Because the Work Wasn't Done Well, Don't Blame the Masses for Being Backward
  　Puyang Chengguan Launches Self-Reporting
    [Our Newspaper, Ji-Lu-Yu, 5th Dispatch] At a conference of 400 village cadres and activists in Puyang Chengguan District, a report on the re-examination work revealed that each district had "air raid shelters," a deceptive tactic set up by landlords. The leadership then raised the question, "Who is to blame for the air raid shelters?" Some village cadres immediately said, "There are air raid shelters because there are landlords." Some said, "Why did we have to starve to death during the famine years, and they didn't put a single thing in our houses?" But other members said, "Can't blame the landlords entirely, we didn't report it in order to store the landlord's things?" This sparked a heated debate. Later, one comrade said, "Storing the landlord's things and not reporting it, it's because our mobilization work was not in place, we can't blame the masses for being backward. Weren't we afraid of hitting the landlord's lackeys in the past?" Ma Futong said, "This is a deceptive trick set up by the landlords to create internal contradictions and try to destroy the peasant association!" Most of the cadres clarified their thinking and agreed to not hit the "lackeys" when they went back, and discussed several specific methods for self-reporting: (1) First, mobilize and persuade at the members' meeting, saying that being in the "air raid shelter" was a conspiracy of the landlords, and that they would not hit the "lackeys" in the future, and that they could perform meritorious service by self-reporting. (2) Hold group meetings to clear up thinking. (3) Hold family meetings to mobilize. (4) Understand the object and mobilize individually. After the meeting, the whole district launched a heated propaganda war, but a few cadres did not fully accept the spirit of meritorious service and self-reporting. The re-examination of West First Street and North Fifth Street adopted the method of household investigation, causing panic among the masses throughout the street, and nothing could be found. East First Street and West Third Street accurately understood the situation after the masses and activists detained the landlords. Under the pressure of the masses, the landlords reported a lot of things, and at the same time, they mobilized the masses to actively self-report. On the first night, 200 families self-reported, and they were commended the next day. During the three-day movement, the ideological awareness of the masses was greatly improved, and the things reported exceeded several times the first re-examination. In the whole district, 638 households self-reported, accounting for one-third of all members. Individual streets reached more than one-half.

　　是工作没有作到不能怨群众落后
  　濮阳城关开展自报
    【本报冀鲁豫五日电】濮阳城关区在四百村干积极分子大会上，汇报复查工作，发现各区都有地主布置下的迷魂阵“防空洞”。领导上即提出“防空洞怨谁”？部分村干即提出“有地主才有防空洞。”有的说：“怎么灾荒年时咱要饿死，他一点东西也不在咱家放呢？”但另一部分会员却说：“不能全怨地主，为了存地主东西不报呢？”引起大家热烈争论，后来一个同志说：“给地主存东西不报，是咱的动员工作不到，不能怨群众落后，过去不是打狗腿打怕了吗？”马福同说：“这是地主摆的迷魂阵，叫咱内部矛盾，想将农会打垮！”大部分的干部思想明确了，同意回去不打“狗腿”，并讨论出几种自报具体办法：（一）首先在会员大会上动员说服，当“防空洞”是中了地主的阴谋诡计，以后不打“狗腿”了，可以自报立功。（二）小组会讨论，打通思想。（三）开家庭会议动员。（四）了解对象，个别动员。会后全区即展开热烈的宣传战，但少数干部，未完全接受立功自报的精神，西一街与北五街复查，采取户查的办法，造成全街群众惶恐不安，查不出东西来。东一街、西三街是群众和积极分子精确了解情况后，将地主扣押起来，地主在群众压力之下，报出了好多东西，同时发动群众主动自报。头一晚上就有二百家自报，第二天便表扬。三天运动中，群众思想觉悟大大提高，报出东西，超过一次复查的几倍。全区自报者六百三十八户，占全会员三分之一。个别街达二分之一以上。
