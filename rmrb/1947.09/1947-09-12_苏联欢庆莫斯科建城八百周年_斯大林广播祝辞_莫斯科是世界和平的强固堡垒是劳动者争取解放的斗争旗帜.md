Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 9th: Moscow dispatch: On the 7th, the day of the 800th anniversary of the founding of Moscow, Stalin specially broadcast his congratulations to the citizens of Moscow, saying: Today, our entire country commemorates this significant day with love and respect because Moscow has made great contributions to the motherland. Not only has it historically liberated the motherland three times from the invasions of the Mongols, Poles, and French, but more importantly, it has become the cornerstone that unites various previously disunited cells into a single nation under a single government. Moscow's contribution to the motherland does not stop there. Since Moscow, according to the will of the great Lenin, was declared the capital of the motherland, it has become the standard-bearer of the new Soviet era. Now, Moscow is not only the inspirer of building a new Soviet social and economic order, but also the pioneer of the worldwide laboring people's movement to strive for liberation from the capitalist slavery system. Now, Moscow is not only the inspirer of building a new Soviet democracy but also the banner for the struggle of all laboring people and all oppressed races and nations throughout the world to liberate themselves from the rule of financial oligarchs and imperialism. Undoubtedly, without this policy, Moscow could not have become the organizational center of friendship among all ethnic groups and fraternal cooperation within our multi-ethnic country. Now, Moscow is not only the founder of building a new way of life for the laboring people of the capital (without poverty, without the tragic sight of millions of poor people and unemployed), but it is also a model for capitals around the world in this regard. One of the biggest sores of major cities in Europe, Asia, and America is the existence of slums. Moscow's contribution lies in completely eliminating slums and moving the people of Moscow from cellars and huts into the high-rise buildings of the bourgeoisie and into well-equipped houses built by the Soviet government. Finally, Moscow's contribution lies in being a pioneer in the struggle for friendship and lasting peace among the people of the world and a pioneer against the inciters of new wars. For imperialists, war is the most profitable business. It is not surprising that their agents are trying in every way to provoke new wars. Moscow's contribution lies in tirelessly exposing the instigators of new wars and uniting all peace-loving people in the world under the banner of peace. Everyone knows that the peace-loving people of the world are watching Moscow with hope, recognizing it as the capital of a great peace-loving power and a strong bastion of peace. Because of these contributions, our entire nation today commemorates the 800th anniversary of the founding of Moscow with such love and respect.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 9th: Moscow dispatch: On the 7th, Moscow celebrated its 800th anniversary in a peaceful and solemn atmosphere under clear and bright skies. The people of Moscow have been working hard for months to welcome this festive day. Thousands of new buildings were completed before the festival, and 250,000 meters of streets have been repaved with asphalt. As the festival arrives, this ancient city of 800 years seems like a young girl in her prime, surrounded by fragrant flowers and colorful decorations. Soviet People's Armed Forces Minister Bulganin ordered a 20-gun salute to celebrate, and congratulatory messages from home and abroad poured in like snowflakes. Mayors of more than 30 foreign capitals such as Paris, Rome, Ottawa, and Budapest personally participated in the grand ceremony. On the same day, Moscow held numerous grand gatherings. The official commemorative meeting was held in the Grand Theater on the afternoon of the 6th. The meeting presented Stalin with a letter of tribute signed by 3,605,859 Muscovites. On the morning of the 7th, a meeting was held on the square in front of the City Soviet to commemorate Yuri Dolgoruky, the founder of Moscow, and a foundation stone laying ceremony was held for Dolgoruky's monument. Vavilov, President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, said in his speech: Eight hundred years ago, Dolgoruky came to the wilderness on the banks of the Moscow River and began to build a small castle, never dreaming of such a bright and splendid future. On the same day, foundation stone laying ceremonies were held for eight skyscrapers in Moscow, the tallest of which has 32 floors and is the tallest in Europe. In addition, athletes from major cities in the Soviet Union held a sports parade and a sports meeting at the Dynamo Stadium. 100,000 actors, singers, dancers, and musicians performed grand songs, dances, and music in various parks and squares, and the music filled the entire city. Muscovites took their guests to travel around the city, which was crowded and unprecedentedly grand. There were more than 14,000 mobile canteens temporarily selling ice cream, fruits, and sandwiches. After nightfall, fireworks lit up the sky, and electric lights were brightly lit. Garlands and neon lights were intertwined around the Kremlin's two-kilometer-long outer wall. Citizens held torches and various wreaths and photos and paraded in teams throughout the night.

　　苏联欢庆莫斯科建城八百周年
  　斯大林广播祝辞
  　莫斯科是世界和平的强固堡垒是劳动者争取解放的斗争旗帜
    【新华社陕北九日电】莫斯科讯：七日当莫斯科建城八百周年纪念日之际，斯大林特向莫斯科市民广播其祝辞称：今天我们全国都满怀热爱和尊敬，来纪念这一有意义的日子，因为莫斯科对祖国具有伟大的功绩。它不仅在历史上曾从蒙古人、波兰人与法国人的侵略中三次解放了祖国；而且首先在于它已经成为这样的基石，即团结各个曾经是不团结的细胞于单一国家之内，并受单一政府领导。莫斯科对于祖国的功绩，还不仅于此，自从莫斯科按照伟大列宁的意志宣布为祖国的京城以后，它已成为新的苏维埃时代的旗手了，而现在莫斯科又已不仅是建设新的苏维埃社会、经济秩序的鼓舞者，而且同时是全世界劳动人民从资本主义奴役制度中争取解放运动的先驱了。现在莫斯科不仅是建设新的苏维埃民主主义的鼓舞者，而同时是全世界一切劳动人民，一切被压迫种族和民族从金融寡头和帝国主义统治下求得解放的斗争的旗帜了。毫无疑义，没有这种政策，莫斯科就不可能成为各族人民友谊以及我多民族国家内友爱合作的组织中心。现在莫斯科不仅是建设京城劳动人民新的生活方式（没有贫穷，没有成百万贫民与失业者的悲惨景象）的创始者，它乃是全世界各国京城在这方面的模范。欧亚美各国大都市的最大的毒疮之一，就是贫民窟的存在；莫斯科的功绩，在于它完全消灭了贫民窟，并使莫斯科人民从地窖与茅屋中搬进资产阶级的高楼大厦，搬进苏维埃政府所建筑的设备完善的房子里去。最后，莫斯科的功绩，在于它是争取全世界人民友谊与持久和平的斗争的先驱，是反对新的战争煽动者的先驱。对于帝国主义者，战争是最有利可图的买卖。他们的代理人正在尝试用各种方法挑拨新的战争，是毫不足奇的。莫斯科的功绩，就在于他不倦地揭发新战争的煽动者，并将全世界一切爱好和平的人民团结在和平的旗帜之下。大家都知道，全世界爱好和平的人民，正满怀希望注视莫斯科，认之为伟大的爱好和平的强国首都，是和平的强固堡垒。因为这些功绩，所以我全国人民今天以这样的热爱与尊敬来纪念莫斯科建城八百周年。
    【新华社陕北九日电】莫斯科讯：七日，莫斯科于晴光明丽中，以和平庄严之姿态欢渡其建城八百年佳节。莫斯科人为迎接此一佳节已辛勤工作数月之久，数千新厦均于节日以前完工，二十五万公尺之街道已改铺沥青。当佳节来临时，此一八百年之古城，似青春盛妆之少女，簇拥于香花彩饰中。苏联人民武装部长布尔加宁命令鸣礼炮二十响志庆，国内外贺电多如雪片。世界名城如巴黎、罗马、渥太华、布达佩斯等三十余个外国首都之市长，都亲自参与盛典。当天莫斯科举行无数盛会，正式之纪念大会于六日下午在大歌剧院举行，大会向斯大林呈上有三百六十万五千八百五十九个莫斯科人署名之致敬书。七日上午，市苏维埃前广场上举行大会，纪念莫斯科创始人尤里·杜哥尔鲁克，并举行杜氏纪念碑之奠基典礼。苏联科学院院长瓦维洛夫致辞称：八百年前，杜氏临莫斯科河上荒山野岭之间，开始建立一小小城堡，当时没有梦想有如此光辉灿烂之前途。同日在莫斯科有八座摩天大楼行奠基典礼，其中最高者达三十二层，高度为全欧之冠。此外来自苏联各大城市之体育家，特举行体育检阅，并在狄那摩运动场举行运动会。十万演员、歌唱家、舞蹈家与演奏家，则在各公园、广场作盛大之歌舞与音乐表演，乐声散满全城。莫斯科人携其嘉宾，倾城出游，熙来攘往，盛况空前。临时出售冰淇淋、水果、与三明治之流动食堂，达一万四千余处。入夜以后，焰火烛空，电炬通明。花环与霓虹灯交织环绕于克里姆林宫长达二公里之外墙上，市民高举火炬及各种花圈、照片、结队游行、通霄达旦。
