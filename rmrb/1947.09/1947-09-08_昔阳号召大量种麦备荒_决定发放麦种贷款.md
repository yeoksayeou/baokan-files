　　【Report from Xiyang】In order to overcome the famine, the Xiyang County Committee and County Government have called on the masses to plant wheat extensively and expand wheat fields in preparation for the lean season next summer. The county has also decided to allocate 300 shi of wheat seed and 10 million yuan in loans (previously mistakenly reported as 1 million yuan) to solve the wheat seed shortage. Specifically, District 1 will receive a loan of 2 million yuan and 100 shi of wheat seed; District 2 will receive a loan of 1.2 million yuan and 50 shi of wheat seed; District 3 will receive a loan of 1.4 million yuan and 50 shi of wheat seed; District 4 will receive a loan of 2 million yuan and 50 shi of wheat seed; District 5 will receive a loan of 600,000 yuan; District 6 will receive a loan of 800,000 yuan and 30 shi of wheat seed; District 7 will receive a loan of 500,000 yuan; and District 8 will receive a loan of 1 million yuan and 20 shi of wheat seed. The focus of the loans is primarily on areas where wheat planting has been limited in the past. Districts 5 and 7 will mainly rely on their own adjustments. The target beneficiaries are newly emancipated households who are unable to afford wheat seed due to difficulties, especially the families of military personnel, cadres, and honored veterans. The villages must ensure that they are provided with wheat seed, and the cadres must take responsibility. The loan method will be implemented through cooperatives. Village cadres will discuss and approve loans to the masses, combining the loans with the masses' own funds. The cooperatives will make unified purchases to ensure that the funds are used to buy wheat seed. Cooperatives are strictly prohibited from using the loans for other production purposes. Any violation of the loan principles or unauthorized diversion of funds will be severely dealt with by the government. Cadres should be responsible for overseeing the implementation and promoting the wheat planting campaign through meritorious service. (Ziyou, XinYing)
    【Report from Pingding】Due to the drought, the famine in Pingding has become a serious certainty. Currently, in Districts 1 and 2 alone, more than 7,000 people have no food and are only eating wild vegetables to survive. In order to provide timely relief, the County Government has decided to allocate 100 shi of relief grain to District 1 and 40 shi to District 2, and is actively organizing the masses to engage in production for self-salvation and conserve resources to overcome the famine. There are currently several methods for overcoming the famine: in Dongxibaian Village, District 1, men are organized to carry loads of sandstone; along the public road in Qian Suohuang and Dong Suohuang, the masses are organized to do small-scale trading and open restaurants, earning ten thousand yuan a day; in Quanjiashan, the masses are organized to sell coal using 70 head of livestock, making a trip every three days and yielding 3 shi and 5 dou of corn. The women in the village weave at home while tending to the seedlings in the fields. In this way, the masses of Guojiashan are organized for production to overcome the famine, setting a model village example for the entire county. At the same time, the cadres and masses of the whole village have put forward the slogan "Production and conservation to overcome the famine, long-term planning to pass the time," and the masses have a high level of enthusiasm for production.

    【Report from Pingding】The famine is severe, and the autumn harvest has sharply decreased. The living standards of the County Government agencies have been greatly reduced. Currently, each person eats only 18 liang of rice per day, saving 7 liang, mainly by eating wild vegetables. The same treatment is given to all outside visitors. All agency personnel have consciously stopped smoking cigarettes. At the same time, office work is stopped every afternoon, and cadres and staff are mobilized to reclaim wasteland. After five or six days, more than five mu of land have been reclaimed, and all of it has been planted with autumn vegetables. There are also plans to continue reclaiming wasteland for planting wheat.

　　昔阳号召大量种麦备荒
  　决定发放麦种贷款
    【本报昔阳讯】为了渡过荒年，昔阳县委会及县政府已号召群众大量种麦，扩大麦田，准备明年夏季青黄不接，县里并决定抽出三百石麦种及一千万元贷款（前误为一百万元），解决麦种困难。计一区贷款二百万元，麦种一百石；二区贷款一百二十万元，麦种五十石；三区贷款一百四十万元，麦种五十石；四区贷款二百万元，麦种五十石；五区贷款六十万元；六区贷款八十万元，麦种三十石；七区贷款五十万元；八区贷款一百万元，麦种二十石。贷的重点主要是过去种麦少的地区，五、七区基本依靠自己调剂，对象着重扶助新翻身户，因困难无力解决麦种，特别是军干属、荣誉军人，村里一定保证给种上麦，干部要负责。贷的方式，通过合作社，由村干部讨论批准供贷给群众，结合群众自己的钱，由合作社统一购买，保证买成麦种，坚决禁止合作社把贷款用在其它生产上，如违犯贷款原则，私自转移用途，受政府严格处理，干部应负责掌握，通过立功开展种麦运动。（子由、新颖）
    【本报平定讯】由于天旱，平定灾荒已成严重定局，现下仅就一、二两区就有七千多人没有饭吃，只吃野菜渡饥，县府为及时救济，特决定拨救济粮一区一百石，二区四十石，积极组织群众生产自救，节约渡荒。现有几种渡荒办法：一区东西白岸村男人组织担挑担沙锅。前锁簧、东锁簧沿公路线，组织群众做零星买卖，开饭铺，每天进洋万元；全家山群众组织七十头牲口卖煤炭，三天内一趟即出玉茭三石五斗。该村妇女在家纺织，捎带锄地里苗子，这样一来，郭家山群众组织生产渡荒，在全县说来已成模范村。同时全村干群提出“生产节约来渡荒，长期打算过时光”的口号，群众生产情绪很高。（克勤）
    【本报平定讯】灾荒严重，秋收锐减，县府机关生活大大减低，现每人每天吃十八两米，节约七两米，主要是吃野菜，对一般外来客人亦同样待遇，全体机关人员都自觉的断绝了吸纸烟。同时每天下午停止办公，干杂人员一齐出动开荒，经五、六天时间，开地五亩多，现已全部下种秋菜，还计划继续开荒种麦。（克勤）
