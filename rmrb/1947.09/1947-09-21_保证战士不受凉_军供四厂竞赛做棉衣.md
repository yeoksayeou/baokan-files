A monthly summary showed an average daily dyeing of 20,000 square feet (ten people), exceeding the previous month's average of 14,000 square feet by 40 percent. In the tailoring team, Song Qiucheng tailored 150 cotton-padded jacket fronts on average each day, Liu Tonglu averaged more than 163 pieces, and Comrade Song Enlei tailored 115 sets of cadre clothing per day, winning the factory's highest tailoring record.

Wang Qi, the leader of Group 7, and Wang Fa worked even when sick, turning on the lights at night to finish what they couldn't complete during the day, achieving a maximum record of 25 sets per day on a "One-Five" machine. The average output per machine was more than 19 and a half sets per day. Comrade Guo Shouwen of Group 5 created the factory's standard quality in July, and also increased the quantity to 15 sets. In August, the quantity steadily increased to 18, 20, and 22 sets, influencing the comrades in the group to work with a hundredfold enthusiasm.
