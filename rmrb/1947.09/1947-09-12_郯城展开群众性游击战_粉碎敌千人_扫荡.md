Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, September 9th: In the Tancheng border area of southern Binhai, newly emancipated peasants, in coordination with local armed forces, launched mass guerrilla warfare, crushing an enemy "mopping-up" operation involving over a thousand troops. On August 13th, a unit of the 28th Division of the Chiang Kai-shek army and the "Returning Home Corps," totaling over a thousand men, launched a multi-pronged incursion into the Xu Tao and Shu He districts. One route, with over six hundred men, crossed the Shu River at dawn and advanced towards Shan Zuokou, encountering fierce resistance from working teams and militiamen along the way. Emancipated peasants in all villages fired guns from all directions. By 3:00 PM, the enemy, in a panic, dragged nine carts of looted grain and clothing westward in a sorry state. Militiamen and working teams closely pursued them. The enemy took refuge on the western ridge of Guye Mountain, where they were met with a head-on attack by a unit of Tancheng, resulting in the capture of all nine carts of looted materials, which were returned to their original owners. This route of the enemy suffered over ten casualties. Another route, with over four hundred men, invaded the Shu He district on the same day. As they crossed the Shu River south of Longmen, they were met with resistance from the militiamen, resulting in eight enemy casualties. On the 14th, an enemy battalion, in coordination with two platoons of the puppet county contingent, advanced southward in two routes. When they crossed the river from Da Wangzhuang, the militiamen and working teams flexibly shifted to the enemy's flanks to strike, causing the two routes of the enemy to misunderstand each other and fire at each other with machine guns and small cannons for two hours, resulting in mutual casualties. By noon, the enemy fled back. On the 15th, the Tancheng County Working Team, taking advantage of the victory, launched an attack deep into the Chiang-occupied area, recovering over ten villages and covering the masses in carrying out re-examination.
