　　World Democratic Forces Increasingly Unite and Grow Stronger
  　U.S. Panic Increases Isolation and Sinks Deeper
    The unity, consolidation, and development of world democratic forces, and the panic, isolation, and decline of international reactionaries, are the main characteristics of international events this week, precisely becoming a microcosm of the basic trends in the post-war international situation.

    The growth of world democratic forces is primarily reflected in the development of the World Federation of Democratic Youth. In a short period, the federation has added five million new members, and now it unites 48 million members from 57 countries, fighting for democratic peace and youth welfare. According to the executive committee of the federation this week, it is actively preparing to convene the Far East Youth Conference in Indonesia in mid-October, which will vigorously encourage and unite the youth in various parts of the Far East who are bravely fighting for independence, democracy, and peace. Secondly, the current Hungarian government, after victoriously crushing the traitorous conspiracy of former Prime Minister Nagy, a ringleader of the reactionaries, the new democratic regime has become even more consolidated. The whole country has now been swept into the upsurge of the democratic election of the parliament, which has caused the U.S. reactionaries' shameless interference to suffer a tragic fate of bankruptcy. Thirdly, the Greek Democratic Army launched a comprehensive offensive against the Greek traitorous government forces, and in just five days, they liberated the territory occupied for half a year like an autumn wind sweeping away fallen leaves. This great victory of the Greek Democratic Army caused the traitorous government to collapse. Fourthly, the Indonesian people's determination to persist in the national self-defense war to the end has won further sympathy and support from the world. The International Brigade, composed of our compatriots, Indians, and Filipinos, was established in Indonesia this week. They vowed to fight alongside the Indonesian people and heroically dedicate themselves to Indonesia's just war. Moreover, the movement within the Netherlands sympathizing with Indonesia and opposing its government's war of aggression has also been expanding daily.

    In addition, in the past week, the rapid progress of Soviet industrial construction and the near completion of a bumper harvest throughout the Soviet Union, the successful implementation of planned economies in the new democratic countries of Southeast Europe, the remarkable achievements of democratic construction in North Korea, and the continued deepening of the struggle of organized workers in the United States against anti-labor laws, all mark: The sunshine of freedom must break through the clouds and shine on the earth.

    The head of the international reactionaries, U.S. imperialism, plagued by the approaching economic crisis, is greatly panicked and anxious to see this situation. Therefore, it continues to disrupt things wantonly, actively assists reactionary forces in various countries, and intensifies the implementation of expansionist policies in a last-ditch struggle. After giving Chiang Kai-shek a prescription, Wedemeyer rushed to Japan and Korea, determined to intensify the cultivation of Japanese militarism and organize the South Korean puppet government, vainly attempting to establish a "Japan-Chiang-Korea anti-Soviet line" to "prevent communism in the Far East." The U.S. government insisted on convening a preliminary meeting of the eleven Far Eastern countries for a peace treaty with Japan alone, in order to manipulate the majority and obtain a legal status for monopolizing Japan. For the "Chiang Kai-shek" of Greece - Tsaldaris, on the one hand, it is preparing active armed assistance, and on the other hand, it wants to pull out a "liberal" Sophoulis to strengthen the reactionary forces in Greece. Even when its Bulgarian godson, Petkov, is about to be executed, it must make a life-saving cry. At the same time, the United States is intensifying its expansion into Europe and further extending into Egypt, the sphere of influence of Britain, instigating Egypt to demand the withdrawal of British troops in order to drive out British forces from Egypt completely. However, the U.S. attempt to save a group of lackeys it has fostered are all incurably ill. The U.S. media's comments on Wedemeyer's statement on leaving China reflect that the U.S. big bourgeoisie's China policy has fallen into a deep contradiction that it must aid Chiang Kai-shek, but aiding Chiang Kai-shek cannot save him from failure. The re-organized Tsaldaris cabinet in Greece (Sophoulis did not dare to take office because he "believed that the guerrillas could persist"), had to helplessly watch it "inevitably collapse" (Greek Democratic Army broadcast). They can only stare at the soon-to-be-executed Petkov. The expansion to Europe and the attempt to monopolize Germany and Japan have resulted in: European countries "growing suspicion and dissatisfaction with the Marshall Plan;" the end of the German industrial level meeting without any major agreement; the Soviet Union again rejecting the U.S. proposal, demanding that the Four Foreign Ministers' meeting be held first to discuss the peace treaty with Japan; and Britain declaring that it "will protect its interests in the Pacific," and so on.

    This superficial show of force by the United States is clearly a manifestation of its "outward strength but inward weakness" and "desperation." The facts of the week prove that the more its muddy feet try to pull upwards, the deeper they sink.

### 世界民主力量日益团结壮大　美国恐慌孤立泥足越陷越深

　　世界民主力量日益团结壮大
  　美国恐慌孤立泥足越陷越深
    世界民主力量的团结、巩固和发展，国际反动派的恐慌、孤立和没落，这是一周来国际事变的主要特征，恰好成为战后国际时局基本趋势的一个缩影。
    世界民主力量的壮大，首先表现在世界民主青年联盟的发展。在短短时期内，联盟增加了五百万新盟员，现在它已团结了五十七国中的四千八百万盟员，为民主和平及青年福利而斗争。据本周该联盟执委会宣布，目前正在积极筹备于十月中旬在印尼召开远东青年代表大会，这对正在为独立民主和平而英勇奋斗的远东各地青年，将起着有力的鼓舞和团结的作用。其次，匈牙利现政府在胜利粉碎反动派头子前总理纳基的叛国阴谋后，新民主政权已更趋巩固。目前全国已卷入了国会民主选举的热潮，这使美国反动派的无耻干涉惨遭破产的悲运。再次，希腊民主军对希卖国政府军发动了全面的攻势，仅在五天内，即如秋风扫落叶地解放了半年来被侵占的土地。希腊民主军的这一大胜利，使卖国政府因而垮台。再次，印尼人民决心坚持到底的民族自卫战争，博得了世界更进一步的同情与支援。由我国侨胞、印度人和菲律宾人所组成的国际纵队，本周已在印尼成立。他们宣誓和印尼人民并肩作战，英勇地献身于印尼的正义战争。而荷兰国内同情印尼反对本国政府的侵略战争运动也已日见扩大。
    此外，在过去一周中，苏联工业建设的突飞猛进和全苏接近完成的大丰收，东南欧新民主国家计划经济的胜利进行，北鲜民主建设的显著成就，以及美国内有组织工人反对反劳工法斗争的继续深入等等，都标志着：自由的阳光一定要冲破云雾普照大地。
    为经济危机日益迫近所苦的国际反动派头子美国帝国主义，看到这种情况，大为恐慌和着急。因此仍继续大肆捣乱，积极帮助各国的反动势力，加紧实行扩张政策，来作一番垂死的挣扎。在跟蒋介石开了一张药方之后，魏德迈又赶到日本和朝鲜，决计加紧培育日本军国主义，并组织南鲜傀儡政府，妄想成立什么“日蒋韩反苏阵线”，以“防止远东的共产主义。”美国政府则坚持单独召开远东十一国对日和约预备会，以便操纵多数，为独占日本取得合法地位。对于希腊的“蒋介石”——曹达利斯，一方面准备积极武装援助，一方面又想拉出一个“自由主义”的索福利斯来加强一下希腊的反动势力。甚至当其保加利亚的干儿子皮特可夫将被处绞刑时，也要作一番救命的叫嚣。同时美国又加紧向欧洲扩张，并进一步伸入英国的势力范围埃及，嗾使埃及要求撤退英国驻军，以便把英国势力从埃及全部赶出去。但是美国企图挽救它所豢养的一群走卒，又都是病入膏盲无可救药。美国舆论界对魏德迈离华声明的评论，反映了美大资产阶级的对华政策，已陷入非援蒋不可，但援蒋又不能挽救其失败的深刻矛盾中。在希腊重新组成的曹达利斯内阁（索福利斯因为“相信游击队能坚持”而不敢上台），又只好眼睁睁看它“不免崩溃”（希民主军广播）。对即将处死的皮特可夫，也只得瞪着眼睛罢了。对欧洲的扩张，对德日的独占企图，招来的结果是：欧洲各国“对马歇尔计划疑虑与不满的增长；”德国工业水平会议的无重大协议而结束；苏联再次拒绝美国建议，要求先开四外长会讨论对日和约；以及英国声言“将保护太平洋上之利益”等等。
    美国这种表面上的张牙舞爪，显然是它“外强中干”和“狗急跳墙”的表现。一周来的事实证明：它的泥足越想往上拔，结果反是越陷越深。
