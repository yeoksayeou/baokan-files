Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 28th. The rampant and unbridled situation of the bureaucratic capital of the Kong and Song families continues to be exposed due to internal conflicts and mutual attacks within the Four Big Families. According to an article titled "The Headquarters of Wealthy Capital: Shanghai’s Calin Building" published in the Kuomintang-affiliated Tianjin Quanxing Daily on August 27th: "Yangzi Jianye Company and Jialing Enterprise Company, both belonging to the Kong family, are located in the Calin Building. This magnificent Calin Building was originally the property of the Jewish businessman Hardoon. After the Japanese surrender, Kong Xiangxi purchased it with 4,000 gold bars (equivalent to 8 billion in Chiang currency at the time). The former is located on the fourth floor, with Kong’s son, Kong Lingkan, as the general manager, and the latter is on the second floor, with Kong’s daughter, Kong Lingyi, as the general manager. Song Ziwen's brother, Song Ziliang, also established Fuzhong Company in Shanghai, competing with the Kong family. The imported goods they deal in range from large items like automobiles and hardware to small items like bras and sanitary napkins, truly encompassing everything. Others cannot obtain foreign exchange, but the owners of Yangzi and Fuzhong can apply for foreign exchange as easily as reaching into a pocket. Others face import restrictions when purchasing foreign goods, but they have official import licenses. At a time when foreign exchange reserves are extremely scarce, they can still import luxury goods in large quantities to enrich themselves, while the requests of general private importers for production materials are ignored. Some say that the combined wealth of the Kong and Song families is enough to solve the financial difficulties of the state (referring to the KMT-controlled areas) for a year. Not to mention anything else, the capital of Yangzi and Fuzhong alone amounts to 1 billion US dollars. They have wealth and power, and are well-informed. With just a few telephones, they control the entire market of China (referring to the KMT-controlled areas), and each time they monopolize and manipulate the market, it resembles a tortuous detective novel. They do not appear in person, and we cannot see their magic hands, but it is this huge trust that is actually controlling our fate. A large part of the reason we are suffering so much is due to these two wealthy families." The article does not mention the "Sino-American Industrial Company" jointly run by Chiang Song Meiling and Chennault, which is even larger than the Kong and Song companies, nor does it mention the Taiping Xingye Company of the Chen brothers, obviously attempting to conceal the heinous crimes of the Chiang Kai-shek family and the Chen brothers in sucking the blood of the people.

    盗窃外汇中饱私囊
    孔宋官僚资本猖獗
    【新华社陕北廿八日电】孔宋两家族官僚资本猖獗横行情形，由于四大家族内部矛盾，互相攻讦而继续暴露。据国民党系统的天津全星报上月二十七日载“豪门资本大本营上海迦陵大楼”一文称：“孔家杨子建业公司与嘉陵企业公司，俱设在迦陵大楼。这个富丽堂皇的迦陵大厦，原为犹太富商哈同产业，日本投降后，孔祥熙以四千条金条（合当时蒋币八十亿元）购置。前者设在四楼，由孔的儿子孔令侃当总经理，后者设在二楼，由孔的女儿孔令仪任总经理。宋子文之弟宋子良也在沪设了一家孚中公司，和孔家互争长短，他们经营的进口商品中，大如汽车、五金材料，小如奶罩、月经带，真是烟波浩渺，无所不容。别人没有外汇，扬子和孚中的主人申请外汇如探囊取物，别人采购外货还有输入的禁止，而他们则有堂皇的输入许可证。在外汇基金极度贫困的时候，还可以大量输入奢侈品，获利以饱私囊，而一般民营进口业输入生产器材的请求，却被搁置不理。有人说孔宋二家之财产之和足够解决一年国家（指蒋区）财政困难。别的不说，单拿扬子和孚中二家公司的资金来说，就有十亿美金。他们有财有势，消息灵通，就凭几只电话控制了全中国（指蒋管区）的市场，而每一次他所垄断、操纵的风潮，则很象一部曲折离奇的侦探小说。他并不出面，我们也看不见他的魔掌，但实际掌操我们命运的，却正就是这个庞大的托辣斯。我们之所以过得这么苦，一大半是要这二家豪门负责的。”该文未提及规模更超过孔宋公司的蒋宋美龄与陈纳德合办的“中美实业公司”，亦未提及二陈家族的太平兴业公司，显然企图掩饰蒋介石家族与二陈家族吮吸人民脂血的万恶罪行。
