Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 4th: Combining the grievance campaign with killing the enemy and striving for merit, a certain unit of the Liaodong Democratic Allied Army has achieved significant success in its troop education work. This has attracted great attention from various units here. The Northeast Daily, in an editorial entitled "The Direction of Troop Education," called it: "This is a revolution in troop education. It truly embodies Chairman Mao's thought of educating troops, that is, coming from the masses and going to the masses. It is the most vivid and powerful education for consolidating troops, transforming thinking, and improving combat effectiveness. This is not just a matter of education methods, but a matter of the direction and line of troop education." The editorial uses this example to solve two problems, namely the main content of current troop education and how to conduct troop education. Chiang Kai-shek's civil war of selling the country has raised domestic class contradictions to a very deep and acute level. This is the primary major event in China's current political life. Troop education must first clarify the truth and essence of this fact and explain why we must resolutely carry out the patriotic self-defense war. In this way, the troops' combat courage will be improved. This education cannot be achieved by a few simple motivational slogans, wartime propaganda, or abstract preaching methods. A certain unit in Liaodong adopted the method of mass grievance, using the facts of the masses' personal experiences to present a picture of the tragic oppression and exploitation suffered by the working people and the ironclad evidence of the enemy's crimes, explaining the origin of this pain and hatred, and naturally focusing it on the reactionary group headed by Chiang Kai-shek. Thus, personal hatred is closely linked with class consciousness, and personal demands are closely linked with collective demands, so that everyone can deeply, clearly, and easily understand the nature of the current war and the individual's due position, attitude, and role in this war. This also lays a solid foundation of class consciousness for the campaign to establish merit. The editorial also pointed out that the education of a certain unit in Liaodong has opened up a broad road for troop education, using their own experience to educate themselves, and using the experience of the masses to educate the masses. It turns education from a rigid affair monopolized by a few people into a lively mass movement. It hopes that all units will understand this experience and further develop it.

Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 4th: Li Boqiu, the political commissar of the unit in Liaodong who led the combination of the grievance campaign and the campaign to kill the enemy and establish merit, stated in his article "Several Understandings of Class Education for Troops": To enlighten the basic consciousness of the soldiers from real life and to clarify the class position is the foundation of troop education. Political teaching materials such as textbooks or temporary speeches alone cannot fundamentally transform the soldiers. The so-called "for the people, for the tasks of superiors," etc., become abstract dogmas. However, in the past troop education, there was less starting from the class and the real suffering of the people, and more textbooks and other teaching materials. This has resulted in more passive criticism of various tendencies, and too little active establishment of class consciousness. As a result, it only played a suppressive role and did not get a fundamental solution. The reason for these phenomena is that many cadres, especially political cadres, come from small and middle-bourgeois backgrounds and do not deeply understand the cruel oppression of the reactionary ruling class. On the contrary, they sometimes retain some exploitative class consciousness. In addition, some comrades who came from workers and peasants have been in the revolutionary ranks for a long time and do not deeply understand these oppressions. Therefore, they believe that grievance is only needed by new comrades and that it is only a matter of method and manner. However, facts have proved that after the initial resolution of the problem of class consciousness, everything has taken on a new look. For example, when fighting, they propose to avenge themselves and their parents and establish merit. The frankness movement can reveal a large number of materials. Unlike the past empty shouts of quickly putting down the burden and being lenient, the spirit and attitude are different. The problem of unity between new and old comrades is also resolved, as well as supporting the government, cherishing the people, and observing mass discipline. For example, some classes proposed to resolutely not live in landlords' houses; bad elements were also exposed, and the troops were consolidated. Cadres, veteran fighters, and leading organs have also been further tempered in Party spirit, and the spirit of leadership and work has been transformed. Grievance education has truly achieved mass education of the masses, mass education of oneself, officers teaching soldiers, and soldiers teaching officers, mutually enlightening and mutually developing, which is by no means comparable to all dogmatic lectures and boring speeches.

Xinhua News Agency, Liaodong, 4th: Zhao Xuzhen was the political instructor of the former Ninth Company of a certain unit in Liaodong. He played a great role in the class education of the unit this time. Under his education, more than 50% of the soldiers in the entire company established merit. He usually does not use textbooks for education, but mainly pays attention to the mood of the troops and what to teach based on the surrounding situation, and implements class education in practical education. Once, when the troops were stationed in a certain place, a tenant farmer named Zhang had a cotton-padded jacket that he had worn for six or seven years. The cotton was in clumps, and it was patched up with layers of stitches. Zhao Xuzhen took the tattered cotton-padded jacket to class to conduct education on the inequality between the rich and the poor and class oppression. He also told about his father's eyes being blinded by the police and the poverty of his family, which moved the soldier Zhao Hongshan to tears. The other soldiers were also moved and said: We are determined to change the tattered cotton-padded jacket for the poor. Once, the company sang, and the villagers all ran to listen. When they sang the song "Who Supports Whom?", the landlords who came to listen to the singing all slipped away one by one. Zhao Xuzhen immediately gave a lesson on how landlords exploit peasants, exposing the evil of landlords as bloodsuckers. On another occasion, when the unit was counterattacking the enemy, an old man in his seventies or eighties told them many crimes of the Chiang Kai-shek troops. Based on the old man's words, he compared the two different armies, explaining that the Democratic Allied Army is the people's own soldiers who serve the people wholeheartedly, while the Chiang Kai-shek troops are tools of the reactionary group that exploits and oppresses the people. Once, when the unit was stationed in Ankoutown, the district chief was very concerned about the troops, but his own life was extremely difficult. There was only an old, tattered quilt on the kang. Zhao Xuzhen took the soldiers to visit the district chief's bedroom, and everyone was very moved. At the same time, he asked liberated soldiers to talk about the corrupt lives of Chiang Kai-shek's officials, and Zhao made a good comparison of the essence of the Chiang Kai-shek government and the democratic government. At a merit award conference, an old lady in her seventies or eighties gave a red flower to the combat hero Wang Yongtai and presented him with a big rooster. Zhao Xuzhen gave a topic for discussion: "When Wang Yongtai is holding the big rooster, what are your thoughts?" The soldiers offered their opinions one after another, believing that it is an unparalleled honor to establish merit and be loved by the people. A liberated soldier said: "Establishing merit as the Eighth Route Army is more glorious than being an official. Watch us in the next battle."

　　诉苦教育与杀敌立功运动结合进行
  　辽东我军阶级觉悟提高
    【新华社东北四日电】辽东民主联军某部以诉苦运动与杀敌立功相结合，在部队教育工作中获得重大成就，已引起此间各部队的极大重视，东北日报在以部队教育的方向为题的社论中称为：“这是部队教育的革命，是真正体现了毛主席教育部队的思想，即从群众中来到群众中去，是巩固部队改造思想，提高战斗力最生动最有力的教育，这不单是教育方法问题，而是部队教育的方向与路线问题。”社论作为这一范例解决了两个问题，即部队教育当前的主要内容及如何进行部队教育。卖国内战中的蒋介石把国内阶级矛盾提高到非常深刻尖锐的程度，这是中国当前政治生活的首要大事，部队教育首先就要把这个事实的真相和本质说清楚，把为什么要坚决进行爱国自卫战争的道理说清楚，这样部队的战斗勇气就会提高，这一教育不是几句简单鼓动口号或战时的宣传品或抽象的说教方法所能做到的。辽东某部是采取了群众诉苦的方法，用群众亲身经历的事实把一幅劳动人民所遭受的悲惨压迫剥削的图画，和敌人的罪恶的铁证摆在大家面前，说明了这个痛苦仇恨的由来，而很自然的集中在以蒋介石为首的反动集团身上。从而使个人仇恨与阶级觉悟，个人要求与集体要求紧紧结合起来，使大家很深刻很明确很容易领会了现在战争的性质和个人在这个战争中应有的地位、态度和作用。这也就给立功运动打下了坚固的阶级觉悟的基础。社论并指出辽东某部的教育给部队教育开辟了宽广的道路，是用自己的经验教育自己，用群众的经验教育群众。把教育从少数几个人包办的死板事情变为生龙活虎的群众运动，希望各个部队领会这一经验，并使之得到更完善的发展。
    【新华社东北四日电】领导辽东某部以诉苦运动与杀敌立功运动相结合的该部政委李伯秋“在对部队阶级教育的几点领会”一文中称：从现实生活中启发战士们的基本自觉和弄清阶级立场，这是部队教育的基础。仅仅课本上的或临时讲话等政治教材等，并不能使战士得到本质的改造，所谓“为了人民，为了上级任务”等等也就成了抽象的教条的东西，但在过去部队教育中，却是从阶级和人民的现实痛苦出发的少，而课本上的教材等多，这也就产生了消极的批评各种倾向多，而积极的去树立阶级的自觉则太少。结果只起了一个压制的作用，得不到根本解决。产生这些现象的原因在于干部特别是政工干部的中小资产阶级出身的多，没有深刻领会到反动统治阶级的残酷压迫，相反还有时保留一部分剥削阶级意识，另外一部工农出身同志，长期在革命队伍中，对这些压迫也领会不深刻，因而认为诉苦只是新同志才需要，并认为只是一个方法方式问题。而事实证明，经过初步解决了阶级自觉问题，一切就面貌为之一新，如打仗时就提出了为自己为父母报仇立功，坦白运动就能坦白大批材料，与过去空喊快放下包袱呀！宽大呀就在精神上态度上都不相同，新老同志团结问题也解决，及拥政爱民遵守群众纪律也解决了，如有的班提出坚决不住地主的房子；坏分子也暴露了，部队巩固了。干部老战士和领导机关也在党性上得到了进一步的锻炼，领导和工作精神得到了改造，诉苦教育正是达到了群众教育群众，群众教育自己，官教兵，兵教官，互相启发互相开展，决非一切教条上课枯燥讲话所能比。
    【新华社辽东四日电】赵绪珍是辽东某部前九连的政治指导员，此次该部的阶级教育中他所起的作用很大，全连在他的教育下，战士立功的达百分之五十以上。他平时进行教育不用课本，主要是注意部队中的情绪和其周围的情况有什么教什么，在实际教育中贯彻了阶级教育。一次部队驻某地时，姓张的佃户有件棉袄穿了六七年，棉花成团，补绽垒垒，赵绪珍就带着破棉袄上课，进行穷富不平，阶级压迫的教育，并说出自己父亲眼睛被警察打瞎，家里穷困的情形，感动得战士赵洪山哭了，其他的战士们也都感动的说：要决心为穷人换破棉袄。某次该连唱歌，老乡们都跑来听，当唱“谁养活谁”这只歌时，跑来听唱的地主都一个个溜走了，赵绪珍立刻就上了一次地主如何剥削农民的课，揭露地主吸血鬼的罪恶。另一次该部于反击敌人时，一个七八十岁的老太爷向他们诉说了许多蒋军的罪恶，他便根据这位老太爷的话，进行了两种不同军队的比较，说明民主联军是全心全意为人民服务的人民自己的子弟兵，而蒋军则是剥削人民，压迫人民的反动集团的工具。又一次该部驻于安口镇，区长对部队很关心，自己生活则极艰苦，炕上只铺一床旧破被，赵绪珍带战士们去参观区长的卧室，大家都很受感动，同时叫解放战士讲蒋军官吏贪污腐化的生活，赵便把蒋记政府与民主政府的本质作了一个很好对比。在一次立功受奖大会上，一个七八十岁的老太太给战斗英雄王永泰带红花，并献给他一只大公鸡，赵绪珍就出题讨论：“当王永泰抱着大公鸡的时候，你有什么感想？”战士们纷纷提意见，认为立了功，得到人民爱戴是无上的光荣，一个解放战士说：“八路军立了功比当官的都光荣，下次战斗看咱的。”
