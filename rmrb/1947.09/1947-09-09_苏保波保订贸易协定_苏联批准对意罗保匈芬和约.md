　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 5th: Moscow News: The Soviet Union and Bulgaria have signed two economic agreements, one of which is the Soviet Aid to Bulgaria Reconstruction Agreement signed in Moscow on August 23rd. It stipulates that the Soviet Union will provide Bulgaria with power stations, metals, fertilizer factories, and coking equipment, and provide technical assistance related to the construction of these enterprises. The second is a trade agreement between the two countries for this year and next year, stipulating that the Soviet Union will exchange metals, oil, paper, machinery, textile raw materials, and daily necessities for Bulgaria's ore, tobacco, and agricultural products. According to Sofia News: Bulgaria and Poland signed a trade agreement in the Bulgarian capital on the 1st, stipulating that the trade volume between the two parties will reach 17 million US dollars each.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd: Reports from various sources: On the 29th of last month, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union approved the peace treaties with Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland, which were signed in Paris last October. It also notified the United States, Britain, and France to exchange instruments of ratification with each other within a few days. The Soviet Union and Britain are scheduled to hold the exchange on the 1st. The people of Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland were "overjoyed" after learning of this news. Italian right-wing elements feared that the withdrawal of American and British troops would increase the difficulty of their rule, but the broad masses of the people welcomed it, believing it to be "clear evidence of the Soviet Union's adherence to the policy of international cooperation." London also "expressed gratitude" for this.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd: Moscow News: On August 30th, the Pravda published an editorial commenting on the Soviet Union's ratification of the five-nation treaties, stating: The ratification of the treaties indicates that the state of war between the Soviet Union and these countries has legally ended and eliminates all obstacles to the development of further international relations between them. The final form of the treaties largely conforms to the democratic demands of these countries, such as opening up the path for the development of democracy and construction, but their future still depends on whether these countries have the sincerity to break with their past. For example, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and other countries have resolutely chosen a new path, but the efforts of the Italian ruling group to eliminate the remnants of fascism in their country are truly doubtful. The editorial continued: "The treaties are not perfect, but this is the best treaty that can be obtained through multilateral negotiations. It is an example of solving complex post-war political issues. Only through international cooperation can such problems be solved. The principles of the Yalta and Potsdam agreements have now triumphed again. Currently, the United States is trying its best to repeat the attempt to command others and destroy international cooperation when formulating the peace treaties with Germany, Japan, and Austria, but this is doomed to failure. The Soviet Union will continue to resolutely fight for democratic peace, world security, and lasting cooperation between all countries, large and small."

### 苏保波保订贸易协定　苏联批准对意罗保匈芬和约

　　苏保波保订贸易协定
  　苏联批准对意罗保匈芬和约
    【新华社陕北五日电】莫斯科讯：苏联与保加利亚业已签订二项经济协定，其一为八月二十三日日在莫斯科签订的苏联助保复兴协定，规定苏联以电力站、金属、肥料工厂，以及炼制煤焦之装备供给保国，并给予此种企业建设有关之技术上援助。其二为两国在今明两年的换货协定，规定苏联以金属、石油、纸张、机器、纺织原料及日用品，交换保国的矿砂、烟草与农产品。另据索菲亚讯：保加利亚与波兰已于一日在保京签订贸易协定，规定双方换货额各达一千七百万美元。
    【新华社陕北三日电】各方讯：上月二十九日，苏联最高苏维埃主席团批准去年十月在巴黎签字之对意、罗、保、匈、芬五国和约。并照会美英法三国于数日内互相交存批准书。苏英两国已定于一日举行。罗、保、匈、芬四国人民得悉此项消息后“举国欢腾”。意大利右派分子恐惧因美英驻军之撤退而增加其统治之困难，但广大人民咸表欢迎，认为系“苏联坚持国际合作政策之明证”。伦敦方面对此亦“表示感谢”。
    【新华社陕北三日电】莫斯科讯：八月三十日，真理报发表社论，对苏联批准五国和约评称：和约之批准，表明苏联与它们在法律上之战争状态从此终结并消除彼此间发展进一步国际关系之一切障碍。和约之最后形式大体上符合各该国之民主要求，如各该国开辟发展民主与建设之大道，但其前途仍须视各该国是否有与其过去决裂之诚意，如罗、保、匈等国已毅然抉择新道路，而意大利统治集团消灭其国内法西斯残余之努力，实令人怀疑。社论继称：“和约并非完美无疵，但此已为多方谈判所能得出之最佳条约。乃解决战后复杂政治问题之范例，唯有国际合作，始能解决此种问题。雅尔达与波茨顿协定之原则，现已再度胜利。目前，美国在拟订德、日、奥和约时，尽力想重演号令他人与破坏国际合作的企图，但这是注定要失败的，苏联将继续为民主的和平、世界安全与大小各国持久合作而坚决斗争。”
