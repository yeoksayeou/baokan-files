Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 11th: The people of Pingchuan in Jinzhong fought for two months, crushing the Yan army's grain-grabbing offensive. The heavily damaged and exhausted Yan army has completely retreated to the Pu-Lu line. The local armed forces of the People's Liberation Army took advantage of the victory to pursue and attack, destroying the Yan army's Xia'ao Village stronghold, 15 li northwest of Qingyuan County, on August 25th, and repelling a platoon of its reinforcements. On the 28th, they crossed the Fen River and annihilated 20 members of Yan's "Struggle Group" in Jiajiazhai, 20 li southeast of Taiyuan County. On the 2nd of this month, they annihilated a company of the Yan army's 70th Division within 20 minutes, 8 li east of Fenyang City, killing and capturing more than 50 people, including the company commander. This large-scale grain-grabbing offensive by the Yan army began in late June, involving 27 regiments, approximately one-half of its remaining total force. The local armed forces of the People's Liberation Army, in coordination with the broad masses of the people, rose up to fight against the grain grabbing, engaging in more than 60 battles. In the Battle of Xiaoyi Town, south of Wenshui, on July 4th alone, they completely annihilated more than 2,000 men of the 216th Regiment of the Yan army's 72nd Division (this division was almost completely wiped out, and its designation was recently cancelled, and the division commander, Ai Ziqian, was dismissed). The militia of Fenyang, Xiaoyi, and Pingyao, Jiexiu counties killed, wounded, and captured more than 320 Yan soldiers in 149 battles. The militia in various places also widely adopted landmine warfare. In Fenyang County alone, 19 explosions killed or wounded more than 40 Yan soldiers. After being looted by the Yan army, the villages in Pingchuan were scenes of devastation, with families ruined and people dying everywhere. Most residents can only fill their hunger with immature melons and beans because the summer harvest crops were robbed or ruined. The Party, government, army, and people of Fenyang held a public memorial service for the heroes who died in the fight against grain grabbing and commended the meritorious personnel. At the meeting, all the soldiers and civilians vowed to avenge the victims and fight to the end to eliminate the Jiang-Yan bandits.

　　晋中平川人民奋战两月
  　粉碎阎伪抢粮进攻
    【新华社晋绥十一日电】晋中平川人民奋战两月，粉碎阎军抢粮进攻。遭受重创和疲惫不堪的阎军，已全部败退向蒲路沿线。解放军地方武装并乘胜跟踪追击，于八月二十五日一举毁灭清源县西北十五里之阎军下凹村据点，并击退其援军一个排。二十八日更渡越汾河，在太原县东南二十里歼灭贾家寨阎记“奋斗团”二十人。本月二日复在汾阳城东八里处，于二十分钟内，歼灭阎军七十师一个连，毙俘连长以下五十余人。此次阎军大规模抢粮进攻，始于六月下旬，动用兵力达二十七个团，约占其残存总兵力二分之一。解放军地方武装在广大群众配合下奋起反抢粮，前后共作战六十余次，仅七月四日文水以南孝义镇一役，即全歼阎军七十二师二一六团二千余人（该师因被歼殆尽，最近番号被取消，师长艾子谦撤职）。汾阳、孝义及平（遥）介（休）三县民兵在一百四十九次战斗中，则毙伤俘阎军三百二十余人。各地民兵并会广泛采取地雷战，仅汾阳一个县在十九次爆炸中，即毙伤阎军四十余人。平川各地经阎军洗劫后，村村一片惨景，到处家破人亡，多数居民因夏收作物被抢光或糟塌，现只能以尚未完全成熟之瓜豆充饥。汾阳党政军民特于日前公祭反抢粮死难英雄及嘉奖反抢粮功臣，会上全体军民誓为遭难人民复仇，消灭蒋阎匪贼而战斗到底。
