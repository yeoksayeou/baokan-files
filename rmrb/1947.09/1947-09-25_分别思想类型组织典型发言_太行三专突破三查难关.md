    Organizing Typical Speeches Based on Different Ideological Types
    Taihang Third District Breaks Through the Three Investigations Barrier
    [This newspaper reports] In order to improve the class consciousness of cadres, thoroughly criticize landlord ideology, and lay the foundation for the re-examination this winter, the Taihang Third District Commissioner's Office stopped work for a week starting from September 3rd, concentrating its efforts on carrying out the investigation of class and investigation of ideology movement. After Commissioner Hou gave a report pointing out the direction of the investigation, all comrades began to reflect on the ideological changes and work performance since the land reform. After two days, it was discovered that most comrades could not reflect deeply: Cadres from landlord backgrounds held a wary attitude, fearing they would be purged, so they dared not expose themselves. Cadres from petty-bourgeois backgrounds believed that they neither exploited others nor were directly exploited by others, and that they could accept the general principles of land reform, feeling there was nothing to investigate, and taking a spectator attitude towards the movement. Cadres from worker and peasant backgrounds felt that they were the ones who had been liberated, holding the idea of investigating others and refusing to reflect on themselves. Based on this situation, the leadership organized typical speeches, which broke the wary attitude, rectified attitudes, and began to seriously and conscientiously investigate. After three more days of personal reflection and exposure, and group criticism, the movement gradually deepened, exposing the following different types of thoughts: Cadres from landlord backgrounds mainly could not separate themselves from their families. Some reflected on losing their wives to struggle sessions and losing themselves, some planned to retaliate against village cadres because their families were struggled against, some reflected that they had donated land to escape struggle, and some even had thoughts of a regime change, stubbornly clinging to the landlord class stance and refusing to let go. Some emphasized that the masses did not take good enough care of them and should not sweep them out the door, and so on. Cadres from petty-bourgeois backgrounds reflected on pitying landlords, agreeing with liquidation but disagreeing with killing, fearing that excesses would cause misunderstandings among middle-of-the-roaders, and holding neutral thoughts of not caring about the movement, demonstrating countless ties with the landlord class. Cadres from worker and peasant backgrounds reflected on: acting as air-raid shelters for landlords due to unclear ideological boundaries. For example, Comrade ×× hid more than 2,000 yuan for a landlord, and also reflected on being restless in work, being emotional, wanting to wear good clothes, and looking down on their original wives after being liberated and becoming cadres, etc. After reflecting, their thoughts became clearer, and most comrades realized that in the past, they had in many ways stood on the landlord's side and opposed the peasants, as well as taken the stance of seniority, made personal problems, and complained, damaging the interests of the masses through their thoughts and actions, and began to turn their backs. Based on this situation, the leadership called on cadres from landlord backgrounds to strictly separate themselves from their families in terms of stance, ruthlessly betray their own class, and move towards the workers and peasants. Petty-bourgeois cadres should wash away their dirty things, learn the hardworking and simple style of worker and peasant cadres, and help worker and peasant cadres improve their culture, and unite with workers and peasants in terms of thoughts and emotions. Cadres from worker and peasant backgrounds should abandon the decadent and hedonistic thoughts they had picked up, as well as the petty-bourgeois habits, and should quickly return to the workers and peasants. During the investigation movement, the Finance and Grain Department also found feudal landlord Liu Ruishan, who evaded struggle and refused to bow his head to the masses, and has been handed back to the masses in his village for handling. The appearance of the organization has since been completely renewed, and they are now planning to further launch a movement to wholeheartedly serve the people and perform meritorious deeds.

    分别思想类型组织典型发言
    太行三专突破三查难关
    【本报讯】太行三专署为提高干部阶级自觉，清算地主思想，打下今冬复查基础，特于九月三日起停止办公一周，集中力量进行查阶级查思想运动，经侯专员做报告指出检查道路，全体同志开始反省土改以来的思想变化与工作表现，经过两天时间，发现大部同志反省不下去：地主出身干部抱有戒心怕自己被清洗掉，因此不敢暴露。小资产阶级出身干部，认为自己既不剥削人，又不直接受人剥削，土改大道理都能接受，感觉无啥可查，对运动旁观态度。工农出身干部，更觉得自己是翻身户，抱着查别人的思想，不肯反省自己。领导上根据这情况，组织了典型发言，才打破戒心端正态度，严肃而认真的检查起来。又轻过三天个人反省暴露，小组批判，运动才逐渐深入，暴露出以下几种不同类形的思想：地主出身干部，主要是个人与家分不开，有的反省出老婆被斗丢了自己的人，有的家庭被斗打算对村干部报复，有的反省献田是为了逃避斗争，甚至还有存在着变天思想，死抱地主阶级立场不肯放松，有的强调群众对他照顾不够，不应扫地出门等。小资产阶级出身干部，则反省出怜悯地主，清算可以，打死不对，怕过火了引起中间人士误会，与对运动不关心的中立思想，表现了与地主关系的千丝万缕。工农出身干部则反省出：因思想界限不明，给地主当防空洞。如××同志替地主隐藏两千余元，又反省出工作不安心，闹情绪，想穿好衣服，翻身当干部后看不起家庭原来老婆等。经反省思想清醒起来，大部同志认识到自己过去许多地方是站在地主立场而反对农民，以及摆老资格闹个人问题发牢骚等，损坏了群众利益的思想行动，开始调过屁股。领导上根据这情况，号召地主出身干部，在立场上与家庭严格分开，无情背叛本阶级而走向工农。小资产阶级干部洗掉自己肮脏东西，学习工农干部坚苦朴素作风，并帮助工农干部提高文化，与工农在思想情绪上结合一起。工农出身干部，抛弃沾染上的腐化享乐思想，以及小资产阶级习气，而应赶快回到工农。在检查运动中财粮科又查出逃避斗争死不向群众低头的封建地主刘瑞山，已交回本村群众处理。机关面貌从此焕然一新，现正在计划进一步开展全心全意为民立功运动。（青野、统兴、武强）
