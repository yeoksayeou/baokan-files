The second session of the United Nations General Assembly has officially begun. Over the past week, the international reactionaries, led by the United States, and their big and small lackeys have been doing their utmost to incite and undermine the United Nations both inside and outside the assembly. In his speech, Marshall even openly expressed his determination to amend the UN Charter and further undermine this international organization that safeguards world peace and justice. The representatives of fascist Greece, Argentina, and the traitor Chiang Kai-shek played the ugliest roles as three clowns tailing behind their American master at the meeting. The head of the Soviet delegation, Vyshinsky, in response, delivered a "startling speech," sharply criticizing and rejecting Marshall's conspiracy to undermine the United Nations, thoroughly exposing the American monopoly capital group's "planned engagement in propaganda for a new war" and the conspiracy of "new war provocateurs"; and powerfully proposed: to prohibit or severely punish the propagators of new war. Vyshinsky reiterated the Soviet Union's consistent policy: resolutely oppose any attempt to shake the United Nations, and resolutely lead the struggle to defend peace against new war provocateurs.

The Soviet representative's powerful call to defend peace has shaken the world, both terrifying the provocateurs of a new war, who exclaimed "Oh, my God! Oh, my God!", and winning the warm praise and response of peace-loving countries. The Syrian representative believed that this was "a blow to the head" for the reactionaries, the Polish representative pointed out that "all countries in the world are eager for peace," and that "creating an atmosphere of war preparation is the enemy of peace," and the Lebanese representative called it "a major contribution to the United Nations"; these indicate how concerned and eager the people of the world are for peace, and how deeply they detest the provocateurs of war.

The economic and political crisis in Western Europe has continued to develop over the past week. This is particularly evident in the nationwide strike movement of millions of agricultural and industrial workers in Italy. This movement began on the 8th of this month, and has become increasingly tense due to the participation of 810,000 steelworkers nationwide in a 48-hour demonstration strike on the 18th, and the launch of nationwide marches and demonstrations on the 20th. An Italian Communist Party spokesperson stated on the 18th that the Italian working class's strike movement was a mass "reprimand" to the Gasperi cabinet, which is implementing the "reliance on the Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan" (according to the Associated Press). The leaders of the Italian Communist Party and the Socialist Party have demanded the resignation of the Gasperi government and its replacement by a government composed of appropriate representatives of various democratic parties. Strikes in France are still continuing.

The struggle against high prices has also spread to the mainland of American imperialism. On the 16th, the CIO annual meeting in Ohio demanded the restoration of price controls, and the CIO authorities in Rhode Island and New York City, the American Communist Party's "Worker's Daily," and other organizations have also put forward similar demands. Protests against high prices by various groups are increasing daily. American monopoly groups are attempting to transfer the losses caused by various countries' restrictions on imports of American goods, the accumulation of domestic surplus goods (whose value has now reached 37 billion US dollars), and the decline in production (down 12 percent in July compared to March) to the domestic working class by raising prices (according to the 16th, US prices have soared by 62.3 percent compared to last year); and they are also attempting to make a huge profit before the outbreak of the economic crisis. However, the result of this attempt will not only arouse resistance from the working class and the vast number of consumers, but will also inevitably accelerate the arrival of the crisis.

The strike movements in France and Italy are essentially struggles by the people of France and Italy against their respective authorities' reliance on American aid and obstruction of domestic democratic reforms. Its development proves that the movement of the people of Western Europe against American imperialism is growing.

This situation, coupled with the approach of the crisis in the United States itself, has alarmed the American authorities, who are urgently seeking solutions. On the 15th, a senior US official exclaimed that the United States should urgently aid the authorities in France and Italy, who are about to collapse, in order to avoid the rupture of the balance of power in Western Europe and the Mediterranean. But since America's "aid" must infringe upon the sovereignty and interests of these countries, and since the likes of Ramadier and Gasperi are increasingly despised by the people of their respective countries, then even if the United States has some "aid," it will, like any "aid" in the past, never be able to save their fate.

The convocation of the Third Congress of the French-Soviet Trade Union Committee is a symbol of the strong solidarity of the European working class. The congress decided to further strengthen the ties and cooperation between the trade unions of the two countries; and adopted resolutions of great significance to the world labor movement, resolutely resisting the reactionary offensive against workers, exposing war profiteers, strengthening the unity of the working class, and resolutely struggling for world peace and social progress. This resolution of the congress will further strengthen the close cooperation between the workers and the entire people of France and the Soviet Union, consolidate the strength of the united struggle of the two peoples, and also point out the direction of struggle and the goals of struggle for the people of Europe and all trade union organizations.

### 联大苏代表痛斥战争挑拨者  西欧经济政治危机继续发展

    联大苏代表痛斥战争挑拨者
    西欧经济政治危机继续发展
    第二届联合国大会正式揭幕了。一周来，以美国为首的国际反动派及其大小喽罗，在会内外极力进行破坏联合国的煽动。马歇尔在其演说中，更赤裸裸表示决心修改联合国宪章，并进而破坏这一维护世界和平正义的国际机构。法西斯希腊、阿根廷及卖国贼蒋介石的代表，在会上扮演了尾随美国主子之最丑恶的三个小丑。苏代表团长维辛斯基对此特发表了“惊人的演说”，尖锐抨击和拒斥了马歇尔破坏联合国的诡计，彻底揭发美国独占资本集团“有计划从事新战争的宣传”，以及“新战争挑拨者”的阴谋；并有力地提出：禁止或严厉惩罚新战争宣传者。维辛斯基重申了苏联的一贯政策：坚决反对任何动摇联合国的企图，坚决领导为保卫和平反对新战争挑拨者而斗争。
    苏联代表这一保卫和平的有力召唤，震动了全世界，既使新战争的挑拨者胆战心惊，发出了“天啊！天啊！”的惊叫，又博得了爱好和平各国的热烈称颂和响应。叙利亚代表认为这是给了反动派“当头一棒”，波兰代表指出：“世界各国都热望和平”，“制造备战空气是和平的敌人”，黎巴嫩代表称之为“对联合国一大贡献”；这些表明了世界人民对和平是如何关切和渴望，对战争的挑拨者又是如何深恶痛绝。
    西欧经济政治危机一周来继续发展。这特别表现在意大利数百万农业工业工人全国规模的大罢工运动。这一运动开始于本月八日，由于十八日全国八十一万钢铁工人参与四十八小时的示威性停工，以及二十日全国游行示威的发动，更急趋紧张。意共发言人十八日称：意大利工人阶级的此项罢工运动，乃是对执行“依恃杜鲁门理论与马歇尔计划”（美联社语）的加斯贝利内阁，作了一种群众的“斥责”。意共及社会党领袖已要求加斯贝利政府辞职，代之以由各民主党派的适当代表所组成的政府。法国的罢工则仍在持续中。
    反对物价高涨的斗争，亦波及美国帝国主义本土。十六日俄亥俄州产联年会要求恢复物价管制，罗德岛州及纽约市的产联当局，美共工人日报等，亦纷纷提出同样要求。各团体反物价高涨的抗议正逐日增加。美国垄断集团企图以抬高物价（按十六日美物价已较去年飞涨百分之六十二点三）将各国对美货入口的限制、国内过剩货物的堆存（其价值现已达三百七十亿元）及生产跌落（按七月份较三月份跌落百分之十二）等损失，转嫁于国内劳工阶级身上；并图在经济危机爆发以前，先捞一把超额利润。但是，这个企图的结果，不仅引起劳工阶级及广大消费者的抵抗，并必然促进危机的加速到来。
    法意罢工运动在本质上是法意人民反对该国当局依赖美国援助及阻挠国内民主改革的斗争。它的发展，证明西欧人民反对美帝国主义的运动在日益扩大中。
    这种形势加上美国本身危机的逼近，使美国当局惊慌之余，急谋解救之策。十五日美某高级官员惊呼美国应紧急援助将倒之法意当局，以避免其西欧与地中海均势的破裂。但美国之“援助”既然非侵害各该国之主权与利益不可，而拉马第与加斯贝利之流又日益为各该国的民众所唾弃，那么，美国纵有若干“援助”，亦将如过去之任何“援助”一样，决不能挽救他们的命运。
    法苏职工委员会第三届大会的召开，是欧洲工人阶级坚强团结的标帜。大会决定进一步加强两国职工会的联系与合作；并通过了对世界工人运动有重要意义的决议，全力反抗反动派对工人的攻势，揭露战争贩子，加强工人阶级的团结，为世界和平及社会进步而坚决斗争。大会的这一决议，将更加强法苏两国工人和全体人民的亲切合作。更巩固两国人民团结斗争的力量，也为欧洲人民和一切职工团体指明了斗争方向和奋斗目标。
