Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 21st. The Hague dispatch: Dutch public opinion expresses extreme disappointment and indignation at the "aid" from the United States, which is like a castle in the air. After the United States refused to accept the report compiled by the so-called "European Economic Cooperation Committee," the Handelsblad newspaper wrote in an editorial: "Just as Marshall was giving a speech in Washington, saying that Europe needed urgent aid, Clayton poured cold water on the representatives of the sixteen European countries who compiled the report in Paris." Therefore, the newspaper concluded: "Optimistic dreams are over." The newspaper "De Waarheid" published an article entitled "A Great Failure in Paris," which stated: "The United States hopes to turn the sixteen countries into huge markets for selling American industrial products. Our people demand: stop the policy of kowtowing to Marshall and Bevin, and we must implement our own national policy."

    【新华社陕北二十一日电】海牙讯：荷兰舆论对于空中楼阁的美国“援助”极表失望与愤慨。美国拒绝接受所谓“欧洲经济合作委员会”所编的报告后，汉得尔斯布拉得报著论说：“正当马歇尔在华盛顿讲演，说需要给欧洲以紧急援助时，克来顿却在巴黎给编制报告的欧洲十六国代表泼了一盆冷水。”因此，该报结论说：“乐观的梦想完蛋了。”瓦尔海德报以“大失败在巴黎”为题著论说：“美国愿望将十六国都变成出卖美国工业产品的巨大市场。我们的人民要求：制止在马歇尔与贝文面前叩头政策，必须实行我们自己民族的政策。”
