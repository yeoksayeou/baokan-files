　　Instructions from the CCP Jiluyu No. 1 Prefectural Committee:
  　Re-examine and Recover Land, Distribute to Peasants Before Autumn
    [Report from our Jiluyu office on the 9th] The No. 1 Prefectural Committee issued instructions calling on all counties to distribute the land found during the re-examination to the peasants before the autumn harvest. The Prefectural Committee held an activist meeting on August 9 to summarize the re-examination work. The meeting learned that this re-examination movement paid more attention to seizing floating wealth and not enough attention to land, and that the land found was not distributed in a timely manner. The Prefectural Committee specifically pointed out: The land found must be distributed to the peasants before the autumn harvest so that the peasants can benefit from the autumn harvest and prepare for planting wheat.

　　冀鲁豫一地委指示
  　复查收回土地秋前分交农民
    【本报冀鲁豫九日电】一地委发出指示，号召各县在复查中，查出的土地，应在秋收前分到农民手里。地委会于八月九日召开活动分子会议，总结复查工作。会中了解到这次复查运动，多注意搞浮财，对搞土地注意不够，且查出之土地，亦未及时分配。地委会特指出：查出之土地，一定在秋收前要分到农民手里，以便农民得到秋收并准备种麦。
