　　Promoting Zhang Fuyuan's Mutual Assistance Writing Method
  　Yushe Develops a Worker-Peasant Correspondent Network
    [Our Newspaper, Yushe News] Yushe's reporting work has greatly developed in terms of organization and quantity. In particular, mutual assistance in writing has been very successful, and the quality of稿件 (gaojian - contributions) has also improved compared to before. Organizationally, the county relies on the Joint Office to organize a seven-person Correspondence Committee; the secretarial offices of each district, with the participation of the district head and political commissar, have established correspondence guidance groups of seven to eight people; the villages have Propaganda and Education Committees, with the branch secretary serving as director, combined with correspondence mutual assistance groups, to promote the entire county. In total, there are 22 county and district cadre correspondence groups with 124 people, and 50 village-level cadre and hero-peasant correspondence groups with 215 people, totaling 339 people, of whom 229 are illiterate or have a rudimentary understanding of writing. Most villages have established peasant correspondence networks, but they are not yet widespread enough. Some worker-peasant cadres are still afraid to write due to their lack of education. In order to strengthen correspondence work, a discussion was held at the county and district cadre meeting on August 30. First, the ideology and reporting stance were examined. Zhang Chang, the Public Security Bureau Chief, said, "I have participated in the revolution for ten years, and I have never written a contribution to the Party newspaper, which is laughable. I have vanity. From now on, I am determined to write." Deputy County Head Shi said, "The small ones don't want to write, and the big ones are afraid of using their brains. It's a matter of determination." Yan Erhuo, the Fourth District Party Committee Secretary, said, "There are many illiterate cadres in my district. We must learn from Zhang Fuyuan's mutual assistance in collective writing." Shi Yuwei, the Second District Party Committee Secretary, said, "I haven't written in eight years. I am no good myself, yet I am vain and I even satirize those who write contributions as not being practical." Tian Qiansheng, Deputy District Head of the First District, said, "When I write contributions, I always think about how to write to suit the taste of the newspaper. My position is not clear. I only write about phenomena and cannot report on the real actions of the masses." The meeting also introduced mutual assistance experiences: Zhang Fuyuan, an illiterate veteran cadre and District Party Committee member, organized a correspondence mutual assistance group in Xishan Village, First District, consisting of teachers and six village cadres. He said, "Work requires research, and writing requires mutual assistance. Whenever I do a central task, I always write a contribution. We all study the materials, I speak and the teacher writes, we write about what we do, and how we do it. After writing, everyone reviews and revises it. Writing clarifies the experience, promotes the work, and helps me to recognize many characters. Now I can write simple reports. It really kills three birds with one stone." Yang Yinlong, a cadre with a rudimentary understanding of writing, said, "I don't recognize many characters and don't have the confidence to write. Later, our Second District formed a mutual assistance group. They did the writing collectively, and after writing, everyone reviewed it. It was published with my name on it. With mutual assistance, we can write good contributions." After discussion, everyone agreed that Zhang Fuyuan's worker-peasant and intellectual mutual assistance was good, and that anything could be done as long as there was mutual assistance. This could greatly develop the worker-peasant correspondence network and gradually improve quality. It was unanimously proposed to learn from Comrade Zhang Fuyuan's spirit of writing contributions and to work together. Finally, Comrade Hao Gang, the County Party Committee Propaganda Minister, comprehensively proposed: (1) Writing contributions should be regarded as one of the tasks, as one of the standards for meritorious service. (2) Launch a Zhang Fuyuan worker-peasant and intellectual correspondence mutual assistance group movement. (3) We must strictly pay attention to the authenticity of the news, continue to check for "empty words" in the news, and each level should be responsible for reviewing the correspondents, with the county uniformly issuing correspondent certificates. (4) Each person should write at least two contributions per month and send them to various newspapers. (Gang Xian, Zhimin, Youcheng)
    [Our Newspaper News] Director Zheng of the Political Department of the Military Region Supply Department, at the mobilization meeting for studying land reform on August 29, once again called on everyone to start writing contributions. In this movement to study land reform, conduct class investigation, and investigate ideology, we should quickly reflect typical materials of introspection and practical experience in learning. Political workers should regard this as one of their important tasks. He also mobilized political work cadres in various units to write at least three contributions per month, which should be reported as a work item at the end of the month. (Bing Hong)

　　推广张福元互助写稿办法
  　榆社发展工农通讯网
    【本报榆社讯】榆社通讯报导工作，在组织上与数量上有很大发展，特别是通讯互助成绩很大，稿件质量也较前提高。在组织上，县依托联合办公室组织通委会有七人；各区的秘书室由区长政委参加，成立了通讯指导组，七人至八人；村有宣教会，支委任主任，结合通讯互助小组，以此为核心推动了全县。总计县区干部通讯组共二十二组、一二四人，村级干部英雄农民通讯组五十组、二一五人，共三三九人，其中不识字与粗通文字的，即有二二九人，大部村建立了农民通讯网，但还不够普及。一部工农干部因没文化水还不敢写。为加强通讯工作在八月卅号的县区干部会上，进行讨论。首先检查思想与报导的立场，公安局长张昌说：“我参加革命十年了，也没动笔给党报写过个稿，让人笑话，有虚荣心，今后要决心写稿。”石副县长说：“小的不想写，大的怕费脑筋，是决心问题。”四区委书记阎二货说：“我区文盲干部多，要学习张福元互助集体写。”二区委书记石玉维说：“我八年没动笔，自己不行还虚荣，还讽刺写稿人不实干。”一区副区长田谦生说：“自己写稿总想的是如何写才合报社的口味，立场不明确，只写现象，不能报导群众真实行动。”会上又介绍了互助经验：一字不识的老干部区委张福元，在一区西山村组织通讯互助组，有教员和村干部六人组成，他说：“工作要研究，写稿要互助，我每做一中心工作总要写稿，大家研究材料，我说教员写，干啥写啥，怎干就怎写，写起大家审查、修改，写稿明确了经验，推动了工作，帮助我识字不少，现能写简单汇报，真是一举三得。”粗通文字干部杨银龙说：“咱识字不多，没信心写，后俺二区组成互助小组，集体研究他们执笔，写好大家审查带上我的名字登出来了，互助起能写好稿。”经讨论大家都认为张福元的工农与知识互助好，只要互助甚也能办，这样可大大发展工农通讯网，又能逐渐提高质量。一致提出要学习张福元同志写稿精神，互助起来干下去。最后有县委宣传部长郝刚同志综合提出：（一）写稿要当成工作之一，当成立功标准之一。（二）开展张福元工农与知识通讯互助组运动。（三）我们要严格注意新闻的真实性，要继续检查新闻中的“客里空”，并由各级负责进行审查通讯员，由县统一印发通讯员证。（四）每月每人至少写两个稿送给各个报纸。（岗先执笔、志敏、有成）
    【本报讯】军区供给其政治部郑主任，在八月二十九号动员学习土地改革的大会上，再次号召大家动笔写稿。在这次学习土改进行查阶级查思想运动中，应迅速反映典型的反省材料与学习中的实际经验。政工人员应看成是本身重要工作之一。并动员各单位政工干部每月至少写稿三篇，月终应作为一项工作汇报。（炳鸿）
