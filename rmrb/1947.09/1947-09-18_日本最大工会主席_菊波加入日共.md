　　Japan's Largest Union Chairman
  　Kikunami Joins the Japanese Communist Party
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th. Tokyo dispatch: Kikunami Katsumi, chairman of Japan's largest trade union, the "Industry Union Federation," has joined the Japanese Communist Party. Kikunami is a famous leader in the Japanese labor movement and enjoys high prestige among the workers. From August 1946 to July of this year, he served as the chairman of the "Industry Union Federation," which has more than two million members. He is currently a member of the left-wing Central Labor Council. He has repeatedly broken through MacArthur's high-pressure policies to organize Japanese workers to oppose MacArthur and the reactionary measures of the Japanese government under his wing. The general strike in October 1946, especially the plan for the August 2nd two-million-worker strike to overthrow the cabinet this year, were initiated by him. Kikunami admires the Japanese Communist Party very much. In his statement after joining the party, he said: "I firmly believe that the Communist Party is the only party that sincerely wants to improve the welfare of labor." Kikunami's glorious joining of the Japanese Communist Party shows that the Japanese Communist Party's influence among the working class has greatly increased.

　　日本最大工会主席
  　菊波加入日共
    【新华社陕北十四日电】东京讯：日本最大工会“产业组合联合会”主席菊波克己，已加入日本共产党。菊波（ＫＩＲＵＮＡＭＩ）为日本职工运动的著名领袖之一，在工人群众中有很高威信，自一九四六年八月至今年七月荣任拥有二百余万会员的“产联”主席，现任左翼中央劳工评议会委员。他曾屡次冲破麦克阿瑟的高压政策，组织日本工人反对麦氏及其卵冀下之日本政府的反动措施。一九四六年十月大罢工，特别是今年二日之二百万工人倒阁总罢工之计划，都是在他发动下进行的。菊波对日共仰慕备至，他在入党后之声明中说：“我深信共产党是唯一真诚要为劳工增进福利的政策。”菊波之光荣加入日共，说明了日共在工人阶级中之影响大为增长。
