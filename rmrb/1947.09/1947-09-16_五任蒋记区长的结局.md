The fate of five Chiang Kai-shek appointed District Chiefs

Sanyu District in eastern Nantong is a nationally renowned second-tier cotton producing area. After the Chiang Kai-shek troops occupied Sanyu Town, they successively appointed five district chiefs, who exploited and oppressed the people. The result was: three died at the hands of the people, and two fled in fear of punishment. The first district chief, Huang Qiming, bribed Yang ＠, the former Chiang Kai-shek county magistrate of Nantong, with 3 million yuan in Chiang Kai-shek currency before taking office at the end of October last year. He began by killing more than 200 farmers, and then, taking advantage of the cotton harvest, he robbed and cut cotton, making a fortune. Li Mo'an, the commander of the First Pacification Area of Chiang Kai-shek's army, also became greedy and dismissed Huang for investigation. Huang then confessed: "I didn't keep it all to myself, I also sent 300 million to County Magistrate Yang." Upon hearing this, Li became even more jealous of Yang ＠, and Yang fled upon hearing the news. Huang Qiming took the opportunity to send another 200 million to Li to settle the matter. After that, Huang also absconded with the money. The vacant post was contested by Wei Chao and Guo Yipei. Guo won because he bribed Li Mo'an and Xu Mojia, the commissioner of Chiang Kai-shek's Fourth Special District, more. However, only five days after Guo took office, the People's Liberation Army first captured Sanyu Town. Guo went to Nantong the day before and luckily escaped. Afterwards, Guo hurriedly requested to resign repeatedly and fled in panic. The third one was Wei Chao. When Wei took office, he saw the town was full of slogans such as "Robbers of cotton, beware of your heads". One night, the people's armed forces attacked Sanyu Town. Wei woke up in panic, got into a car, and attempted to escape. When he approached the river, he was finally captured and executed by the local farmers. The fourth district chief, Huang Shidong, only dared to stay in office for three days, and then the original fourth district chief, Tang Jingzong, took over as the fifth district chief. On the first day of taking office, he was aggressive, conscripting laborers and seizing grain, wantonly gathering. Huang Shidong, the former fourth district chief, was jealous and brought a large sum of money to Sanyu Town to partner with Tang in collecting cotton. However, on the third day, the People's Liberation Army came to Sanyu Town again, shot and killed Tang Jingzong, and captured Huang Shidong and handed him over to the local people for public trial and execution by firing squad.

　　五任蒋记区长的结局
    南通东部三余区，是全国著名的第二产棉区。蒋军侵占三余镇后，曾连委五任区长，鱼肉人民。结果是：三个死在人民手里，两个畏罪潜逃。第一任区长黄启明在蒋记前南通县长杨＠献贿三百万元蒋币后，于去年十月底接事。一开始就残杀农民二百多，复乘棉花登场，连抢带割，大发横财。蒋记第一绥靖区司令李默庵，也垂涎三尺，当将黄撤职查办。黄乃供称：“非我独吞，尚有三亿元相送杨县长。”李闻之更嫉妒杨＠，杨闻讯，即溜之大吉。黄启明乘机另送二亿元给李息事。此后黄亦卷款潜逃。遗下肥缺，有魏超、郭义培二人争夺，因郭对李默庵与蒋记第四专署专员徐谟嘉纳贿较多获胜，但郭到任刚五天，解放军首次攻克三余镇，郭于前一日往南通，侥幸漏网，事后，郭慌忙再三请求辞职，溜之大吉。第三任轮到了魏超，魏到任时，看见全镇贴满了“抢棉花的强盗，当心你的头脑”等标语。一个晚上，人民武装袭入三余镇，魏以睡梦中惊醒，慌忙坐上汽车，企图逃脱，当其驶近江边时，终被当地农民捉获处决。第四区长黄士东到任仅三天，就不敢再干，由原四任区长汤景宗出任第五区长。到任第一天，其势汹汹，拉夫抢粮，肆行聚原四任区长黄士东见了眼红，乃挟巨款至三余镇，要与汤合股收棉花。可是第三天，解放军又再度来到了三余镇，当将汤景宗击毙，将黄士东捉获交当地人民公审枪决。
