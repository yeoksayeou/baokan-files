　　Lincheng Fifth District Cadres and Masses Guarantee Sufficient Manure for Military Dependents' Wheat Planting
    [Report from this newspaper, Lincheng] To guarantee sufficient manure for military dependents' wheat planting, the Fifth District launched a movement to cut thorny twigs and scrape grass soil. After the district-wide Great Meritorious Service campaign, cadres and masses alike felt that performing meritorious service for the people was truly glorious. Everyone discussed that while they had rendered meritorious service, they must not forget the bloodshed of the soldiers at the front, and they must do a good job in supporting the front lines and taking good care of the families, achieving thorough preferential treatment for military personnel. Therefore, under this ideology, villages began to act one after another, rushing to cut thorny twigs and scrape grass soil, making a lot of manure, forming a mass movement throughout the district. Zhao Maijia, a meritorious hero from Haozhuang Village, led his mutual aid team and influenced the six mutual aid teams in the entire village, actively cutting thorny twigs with people carrying them and mules hauling them. The militia mutual aid team challenged other teams in the village to compete for merit, each person carrying more than three loads a day, and at least two loads, exceeding the achievements of the general masses. Within a day, 48 people cut more than 15,000 catties of thorny twigs. This influence motivated even Cui Gongtian, who was usually not very active, and Wang Qunzhi, who was lazy, to participate. Not only did they go themselves, but they also brought their livestock, collecting fertilizer for military dependents every day without fail. When retired soldiers saw the spirit of the masses, they also took the initiative to cut green fertilizer for military dependents. Cadres in Dianshang Village took the lead, and District cadre Comrade Wei Xuan personally led the masses to cut thorny twigs in the eastern mountains, even carrying a load of 140 catties back. Hero Wang Fengzhen carried a load of 180 catties, and the masses said: We must learn from the heroes. In Zhaozhuang Village, men cut thorny twigs, and 28 women also participated. Other women proposed that while they could cut thorny twigs, they would scrape grass soil at home to produce more fertilizer, ensuring that they fulfilled their task of providing preferential treatment to military personnel and guaranteeing manure for military dependents. Men and women throughout the district vigorously collected fertilizer. After the green fertilizer was carried back and distributed to military dependents by the village, the masses carried the thorny twigs to the fields of the military dependents to compost fertilizer. In order to guarantee the task of 40 loads of fertilizer for irrigated land and 20 loads for dry land for military dependents, Zhao Maijia provided meals and also stayed overnight in the fields of military dependents for two nights. After district-wide inspection, a total of 15,000 loads of thorny twigs were cut and composted for fertilizer, and more than 3,600 loads of miscellaneous fertilizer were accumulated by women within three days. Each military dependent household's land reached the level of 40 loads of fertilizer for irrigated land and 20 loads for dry land. Zhu Duizi, a military dependent from Haozhuang, said with emotion: "This year's preferential treatment for military personnel couldn't be better. In the drought, they gave military dependents priority in planting and weeding. Now they are so busy, but the masses are giving priority to cutting thorny twigs and composting manure. There is really nothing to say, I can only tell my children to fight the enemy well!" (Shu Tong)

　　临城五区干群保证军属种麦粪足
    【本报临城讯】保证军属种麦粪足，五区割荆芽、刮草土，形成运动。全区大贺功后，干部、群众都觉得为民立功，真是非常光荣。大家谈到立了功可要忘不了前线战士的流血，咱们要做好支援前线。好好照顾家属，做到彻底优军。因此各村在这一思想下，先后都动起手来，抢割荆芽刮草土，多多沤粪，形成了全区的群众性的运动。郝庄村立功英雄赵麦甲带起自己的互助拨工大队，并推动影响起全村六个拨工大队，人担骡驮的积极抢割荆芽，民兵互助队为了争功与全村各队挑战，每人一天多的三担，少的两担，超过一般群众的成绩，一天内四十八人抢割荆芽一万五千多斤。这一影响，把在平时不大积极的崔公田、懒散的王群芝等，也推动起来，不但人去，还赶上自己的牲口，一天不隔的给军属集肥，荣退军人看到群众这种精神，自己也主动给军属割青肥。店上村干部带头，区干部魏选同志亲自带领群众去东山割荆芽，回来还担一百四十斤的担子。英雄王逢珍一担子担一百八十斤，群众说：咱们要向英雄看齐。赵庄村男子割荆，二十八个妇女也参加，其他妇女提出他们能割荆芽，咱就在家刮草土多搞粪料，一定尽到咱们优军的任务，保证军属有粪便。全区男女都大力集肥，他们将青肥担回来经村分配军属后，群众各自将荆芽就给军属担到地头上沤肥来。赵麦甲为了保证军属水地上粪四十担、旱地二十担任务，自己管饭，又给军属卧了两夜地。经过全区检查，在三天内共割荆芽沤肥一万五千担，妇女堆杂肥三千六百余担。每户军属土地，水地均达上粪四十担，旱地二十担的水平。郝庄军属朱对子感动的说：“今年优军再好不能，天旱先给军属点种，还给锄苗，现在这样忙，群众又先给割荆芽、沤粪，真叫没话说，只好叫孩子好好打敌人吧！”（树桐）
