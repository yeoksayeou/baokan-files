　　Captured Chiang Soldier Wu Qiyun Confirms:
  　Chiang Troops Breached the Guanmeng Embankment
    【Xinhua News Agency, Jinji Luyu, 9th】 Wu Qiyun, a soldier of the Zhao Zhenting unit of the Kaifeng Chiang Army guerrilla force, who was captured by the People's Liberation Army in northern Henan for participating in the breaching of the Guanmeng Embankment, confessed: He is a native of Qian'ewan, 28 years old this year. On August 17th, his affiliated Chiang troops were stationed in Haizhuang. That night, they were ordered to breach the Guanmeng Embankment two miles north of Xinzhuangji. The Yellow River water burst forth, and they held the breach, preventing local people from approaching, while notifying Henan to send troops to cross north. The masses in Quhe County in the Liberated Area repeatedly tried to block the breach but were dispersed by gunfire. Chiang's troops, including the Wang Xuwu and Liang Dai units in Fengqiu, and nearly a thousand local reactionary miscellaneous forces such as pseudo-township security regiments from Changyuan Dache, took advantage of the flooding to loot extensively in the Quhe area, detaining and killing many people. Five representatives of the masses from the Third District and Sanyoupo who went to petition and block the embankment were also detained, and the representatives from Huxi and Huanglingji were brutally murdered. By the 18th, the water level had risen sharply, and villages south of Huanglingji had become a watery expanse.
