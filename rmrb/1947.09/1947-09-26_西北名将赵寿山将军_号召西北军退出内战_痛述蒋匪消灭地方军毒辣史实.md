Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 21st—General Zhao Shoushan, a famous general of the Northwest Army, was overjoyed to hear the news that the 38th Army of the Northwest Democratic Allied Army, led by General Kong Congzhou, had crossed the Yellow River with the Jinan People's Liberation Army to advance into the Chiang-controlled areas. He expressed his fervent hope for the soldiers at the front: to defeat the bandit chiefs Chiang Kai-shek and Hu Zongnan, continue to fight alongside friendly forces, persevere, and perform meritorious service for the people. Zhao also spoke on the painful historical lessons of the Northwest Army and its future, calling on all local armies currently driven by Chiang Kai-shek on the Northwest battlefield to quickly awaken, withdraw from the civil war, and stand on the side of the people. Zhao first recounted Chiang Kai-shek's conspiracy to eliminate the 38th Army he had created, saying, "After the start of the War of Resistance Against Japan, Chiang Kai-shek divided and used my troops, attempting to use the trick of 'burning Hulukou Valley' to allow the Japanese to eliminate them. The 17th Division was divided and usurped, shrinking from its original strength of more than 13,000 to only 3,000. In 1944, he used the vicious trick of 'luring the tiger away from the mountain' to transfer me to the nominal post of Commander-in-Chief of the Third Army Corps, while assigning Zhang Yaoming, a confidant of Chiang Kai-shek, to command the 38th Army. Fortunately, the unit escaped death and, led by General Kong Congzhou and others, revolted in western Henan and entered the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Liberated Area, forming the 38th Army of the Northwest Democratic Allied Army. They joined hands with the People's Liberation Army led by the Chinese Communist Party and, when Japan surrendered and Chiang Kai-shek launched the civil war, went to the front line of the self-defense war, participating in the battles of Shangdang, Pinghan, and Jinan." At this point, Zhao excitedly summarized the growth of the army he had witnessed, saying, "When I passed through Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu, I witnessed that the 38th Army had undergone a complete transformation under the enthusiastic care and help of the army and people in the Liberated Area. The unit had expanded fourfold compared to before, its equipment had been strengthened, and it had learned Mao Zedong's strategies and tactics to a considerable extent. The quality and combat effectiveness of the unit had greatly improved, and its morale was extremely high. Now, it is participating in the Yu-Shaan Liberation War along with the Jinan Liberation Army and has achieved brilliant results. In the future, it will continue to fight alongside the Liberation Army for the liberation of the Great Northwest and the realization of an independent, democratic, free, and happy New China." Zhao then spoke in a tone of deep regret about the current plight of other local armies in the Northwest, such as Lu Dachang's troops in Gansu, Gao Guizi and Zuo Shiyun's troops in Shaanxi, and the Four Ma's troops in Qinghai and Ningxia, who have either been largely eliminated by Chiang Kai-shek or are in the process of being eliminated. He said, "Although Shaanxi army general Gao Guizi obeys Chiang Kai-shek and Hu Zongnan's orders meticulously, his 17th Army has been eliminated to the point where only one regiment remains, and military power has fallen into the hands of He Wending, a confidant of Chiang Kai-shek and Hu Zongnan. Gao himself only enjoys the nominal title of 'Deputy Director of the Xi'an Pacification Headquarters.' Chiang Kai-shek and Hu Zongnan have adopted even more sinister and vicious methods against the Four Ma's of Qinghai and Ningxia, such as using barbarians to control barbarians, supporting younger brothers to destroy older brothers. For example, they bought off Ma Bufang, attacked Ma Buqing, assigned the latter's troops to the former, and even gave the chairmanship to Ma Bufang, eventually forcing Ma Buqing to go to Gansu to become a 'gentleman of leisure.' Ma Hongkui and Ma Hongbin of Ningxia were also provoked and alienated, regarding each other as enemies. Therefore, although they are called the Four Ma's, in reality, only two remain. During the reorganization last year, the two cavalry divisions of Qinghai Ma were reduced to one regiment, while the 36th Division under Hu Zongnan's direct control, although also reorganized, was expanded to three regiments per brigade and four battalions per regiment. Now, Chiang Kai-shek and Hu Zongnan are inducing the Ma family armies of Ningxia and Qinghai to attack the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, serving as sacrifices for Chiang Kai-shek's civil war. In this summer's Longdong campaign, the original 81st Division of Ma Hongbin was severely punished by the Northwest Liberation Army, and most of it was annihilated, leaving only the remnants of the division and brigade headquarters and less than a thousand scattered soldiers who had lost their weapons. Ma Bufang's 82nd Division also suffered heavy losses, with more than a thousand casualties." Zhao finally stated emphatically, "History and facts make it very clear that armies that betray the people and attack the people have only the prospect of being eliminated, while armies that face the people and fight for the interests of the people have a bright future. All local armies on the Northwest battlefield who have been deceived and driven by Chiang Kai-shek and Hu Zongnan should quickly awaken, withdraw from the quagmire of civil war, and come over to the side of the people. This is the only way to save the country, save the people, and save yourselves."

    西北名将赵寿山将军
    号召西北军退出内战
    痛述蒋匪消灭地方军毒辣史实
    【新华社西北二十一日电】西北军名将赵寿山将军，闻悉西北民主联军第三十八军孔从周将军所部随同晋南人民解放军南渡黄河，挺进蒋管区作战的捷报，欢欣异常，并对前线健儿寄予热切希望：为打倒蒋胡匪首，继续与友军并肩作战，再接再厉，为人民立功。赵氏并就西北军的惨痛历史教训及其前途，发表谈话，号召目前西北战场上一切为蒋贼驱策的地方军赶快觉醒，退出内战，站到人民方面来。赵氏首述蒋贼阴谋消灭其手创的三十八军的经过，称：“蒋贼于抗日战争开始后，即将我部分割使用，企图以‘火烧葫芦峪’的诡计让日寇来消灭。十七师被分化、纂夺，竟从原有之一万三千余人削弱至仅存三千余人。民国三十三年复以‘调虎离山’毒计，调我住空头的第三军团军总司令，而以蒋贼心腹张耀明来统率三十八军。幸而该部死里逃生，在孔从周将军等率领下，在豫西起义，开入晋冀鲁豫解放区，成立西北民主联军第三十八军，与中共所领导的人民解放军携手合作，并在日寇投降，蒋贼发动内战时，开赴自卫战争前线，参加上党、平汉、晋南诸战役”。至此，赵氏兴奋地概括其亲见该军的壮大情形说：“当我路过晋冀鲁豫时，目睹三十八军在解放区军民热诚的爱护与帮助下，面目已焕然一新，部队较前扩大了四倍，装备亦已加强，且相当的学会了毛泽东的战略战术，部队素质和战斗力大大提高，士气极为旺盛。现又随同晋南解放军参加豫陕解放战争，并获致辉煌战果。今后自将继续与解放军一道，为解放大西北与实现独立、民主、自由、幸福的新中国而奋斗到底。”赵氏继以沉痛惋惜语气，谈及目前西北其他地方军如甘肃之鲁大昌等部，陕西之高桂滋、左世允等部，及宁青四马等部或大部被蒋贼消灭或正在被消灭中的惨状说：“陕军将领高桂滋虽对蒋胡奉命唯谨，但其十七军已被消灭至仅余一个团，军权亦已落入蒋胡亲信何文鼎之掌握，高本人仅享有‘西安绥署副主任’的空头名义。蒋胡对青（海）宁（夏）的四马，更采取了以夷制夷，扶弟灭兄等的阴险毒辣办法，如收买马步芳，打击马步青，将后者的部队编给前者，把主席也给了马步芳，最后逼得马步青跑到甘肃去当‘寓公。’宁夏马鸿逵、马鸿宾也被挑拨离间，相互视若仇敌，所以名为四马，实则只剩了两马。迨至去年整编时，青马两个骑兵师被缩编为一个团，而胡之嫡系钟松所辖之三十六师虽也同样整编，却扩大为每旅三个团，每团四个营。现在蒋胡又诱使宁青马家军来进攻陕甘宁边区，替蒋贼当内战的牺牲品。今夏陇东战役中，原马鸿宾的整八十一师遭西北解放军严重惩罚，大部被歼灭，仅余师部和旅部残存人员及不足千余名并丢光了武器的散兵。马步芳的整八十二师也受重创，损失千余人。”赵氏最后力称：“历史和事实说得非常清楚，背叛人民，进攻人民的军队只有被消灭的前途，而面向人民，为人民利益而战的军队，就有光明的前途。西北战场上一切受蒋胡欺骗驱使的地方军应赶快觉醒，退出内战泥坑，投奔到人民方面来。这是救国家、救人民、也是救自己的唯一出路。”
