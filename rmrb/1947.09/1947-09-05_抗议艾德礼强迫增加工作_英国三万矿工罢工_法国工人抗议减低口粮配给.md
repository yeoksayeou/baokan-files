　　Protesting Attlee's Forced Increase in Work
　　British Miners Strike
　　French Workers Protest Reduced Rationing
Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 31st: London dispatch: British miners are beginning to respond to Attlee's measures to control workers and force them to increase work with strikes. As of the 29th, approximately fifteen mines in the southern Yorkshire, the largest coal-producing area in Britain, have been shut down, with 30,000 miners striking to protest the decision by the National Coal Board and the chairman of the Miners' Union to force them to expand the coal mining area; at the same time, they are supporting the 2,700 miners at the Grimethorpe mine in the county who were dismissed for striking against increased work. On the walls of the Grimethorpe mine, drawings of gallows have appeared, with the words "Hang Lawther" written on them. This so-called chairman of the Miners' Union had denounced the workers' protests as "not just evil but simply insane." According to a Reuters dispatch on the 29th, this strike is causing a daily loss of 35,000 tons of coal. And this is at a time when Britain cannot save even a single basket of coal. On the same day, personnel from the National Coal Board stated that miners in all 150 mines in the area were in danger of becoming involved in this protest strike. The strike has thrown the Labour cabinet into a panic, and the Labor Bureau and the Coal Board are urgently holding meetings to discuss ways to prevent the strike from expanding.
　　
Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st: Paris dispatch: According to a decision by the French cabinet, starting today, the French people's food ration has been reduced to only 200 grams per day (approximately 5 liang and 3 qian and 6 fen in Chinese measurement). Bakeries in Paris have also been ordered to close for two days a week. After the cabinet announced this decision on the 27th of last month, it immediately aroused dissatisfaction among the lower and middle classes of the French people. The French General Confederation of Labor and the Railway Workers' Federation, at the request of the workers, protested to Ramadier on the 30th of last month against reducing workers' food rations. The Brest arsenal, coffee shops in Paris, the Baby factory in Batignolles, railway workers in Rouen, and others have all gone on strike to protest the authorities' decision to reduce rations.

　　抗议艾德礼强迫增加工作
  　英国三万矿工罢工
    法国工人抗议减低口粮配给
    【新华社陕北三十一日电】伦敦讯：英国矿工开始以罢工来回答艾德礼管制工人及强迫增加工作的措施。迄二十九日止，英国唯一最大产煤区约克郡南部的大约十五个矿场已行停闭，三万矿工罢工抗议全国煤业局及矿工同盟主席强迫他们扩大挖煤面积的决定；同时声援该郡格利姆索尔波矿场因罢工反对增加工作而被解雇的两千七百名矿工。在格利姆索尔波矿场的墙壁上，已出现绞架的画图，上写“绞死劳瑟”，因此一所谓矿工同盟的主席，曾斥工人的抗议为“不只是罪恶简直是精神错乱”。据路透社二十九日电称：此项罢工每日损失煤炭三万五千吨。而这正是英国连一筐子煤都节省不下来的时候。同日全国煤矿局人员称：该区一百五十个矿场的矿工有全部卷入此种抗议性罢工的危险。罢工已使工党内阁手忙脚乱，劳工局与煤矿局紧急开会讨论防止罢工扩大的办法。
    【新华社陕北一日电】巴黎讯：根据法国内阁的决定，自本日起，法国人民的粮食配给已减为一天仅有两百格兰姆（按约合中国五两三钱六分）。巴黎的面包店并被命令每周关门两天。内阁上月二十七日宣布这一决定后，立即引起法国中下各阶层人民的不满。法国总工会与铁路工人联合会应工人要求于上月三十日向拉马第提出抗议反对减低工人口粮配给。而布勒斯特兵工厂。巴黎的咖啡店，巴吞的贝比工厂，卢昂铁路工人等均以罢工抗议当局的减低口粮决定。
