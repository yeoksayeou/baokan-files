Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, September 3rd: Moscow dispatch: The Soviet Union's second reply rejecting the U.S.'s unilateral convening of a Japanese peace treaty conference was delivered to the U.S. government on August 29th. The reply, in response to Marshall's note of August 13th regarding the convening of an eleven-nation conference to draft a peace treaty with Japan, stated: The Soviet government believes that the United States has no reason to oppose the prior discussion of the issue of convening a conference to draft a peace treaty with Japan by the Council of Foreign Ministers of the Four Powers, because the Potsdam Conference resolution established the Council of Foreign Ministers to carry out the necessary preparatory work for resolving treaty issues. This resolution is by no means limited to European peace treaty issues. The Council of Foreign Ministers includes a Chinese representative, which proves its qualification to resolve the Japanese peace treaty issue. This point has been acknowledged by the U.S. government, but in the memorandum of August 13th, it is attached with an arbitrary reservation, namely, the so-called "the Council of Foreign Ministers may be used to prepare the Japanese peace treaty, but only with the consent of all member states." The Soviet government cannot accept this reservation at all. The reply continued: The Soviet Union, Britain, and China have a special relationship with the post-war situation in Japan. The Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference in 1945 stipulated that the Four Powers participate in the Allied Council for Japan; and the resolutions of the Far Eastern Commission in Washington must be unanimously agreed upon by the Four Powers. The Soviet government cited this resolution in its previous note, but the U.S. government did not respond to it in its reply of August 13th. In view of the above circumstances, the Soviet government reserves the position stated in its reply of July 22nd and insists that the issue of convening a Japanese peace treaty conference must first be discussed by the Council of Foreign Ministers including representatives from the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and China.

　　美国妄图片面召开对日和会
  　苏联二次复文拒绝
    坚持维护四国外长事先讨论原则
    【新华社陕北三日电】莫斯科讯：苏联二次拒绝美国片面召开对日和约会议之复文，已于八月二十九日送达美国政府。该复文在答复马歇尔八月十三日关于召开十一国会议，以草拟对日和约问题之照会时称：苏联政府认为：美国没有理由反对由四强外长会议预先讨论召开草拟对日和约会议的问题，因波茨顿会议决议建立外长会议，是要它实现解决和约问题的必要准备工作。此决议决非只限于对欧洲之和约问题。外长会议包括中国代表在内，因此证明了它有资格解决对日和约问题。此点虽已为美国政府承认，然在八月十三日之备忘录中，却附有武断的保留即所谓“外长会议得用以准备对日和约，但须经所有会员国之同意”。苏联政府完全不能接受这种保留。该复文继称：苏、英、中对战后日本局势有特别关系，一九四五年莫斯科外长会议协议，规定四强参加盟国对日委员会；而且华盛顿之远东委员会之决议，必须由四强之一致同意。苏联政府在其上次之照会中，曾引述此项决议，而在美国政府八月十三日之复文中，对此则未作任何答复。鉴于上述情形，苏联政府保留其七月二十二日复文中所表明之立场，坚持召开对日和约会议之问题，必先经过包括苏美英中四国代表之外长会议讨论。
