　　[Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 17th] The Chiang Kai-shek bandit propaganda organs have recently spread rumors that Madame Sun would participate in the puppet National Assembly "election" in Guangzhou.

I have no intention of engaging in any political activities to participate in the (Chiang) government.

    【新华社陕北十七日电】蒋匪宣传机关近散布所谓孙夫人将在广州参加伪国代“竞选”之谣言，孙夫人宋庆龄女士对此已郑重否认。据合众社上海十六日电引宋女士声明称：“此种传闻完全不确。我并无任何从事政治运动以图参加（蒋）政府的意图。此外，我想这种消息是从广州发出来的，而我在广州既不是“代表”，也不是正式居民。”
