Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th. Comprehensive reports indicate that all 2,000 employees of the Shanghai American-owned Electric Power Company launched a unanimous strike and demonstration on the 23rd to protest the illegal arrest by the Shanghai Chiang bandit authorities of six people, including Wu Kewen, an employee of the Electric Power Company and a union official, on the 20th. To take care of the lives of the citizens, the workers still tried their best to supply electricity to users during the strike. On the evening of the 23rd, the entire group marched to the gate of Chiang's Social Bureau to hold a demonstration, demanding the immediate release of the arrested employees. However, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang used suppression to deal with the demands of the workers and masses, and arrested six more employees. On the 24th, Xuan Tiewu threatened that "suspected elements will continue to be arrested." At the same time, Shen Ding, the director of the Labor Department of Chiang's Social Bureau, also howled that "no absenteeism or strikes will be allowed during the general mobilization period," fully exposing the hideous faces of the fascist bandits. Under the multiple tortures and oppressions of the Chiang bandit authorities, the workers' strike to fight for personal freedom lasted for 24 hours. Another report: Employees of the French Tram Company who were laid off during the war also held a demonstration on the 24th and surrounded the company, demanding reinstatement. They were suppressed by Chiang's police. One worker was stabbed by the police with a bayonet, but the laid-off employees insisted on fighting and were not moved. Finally, the company was forced to allow all workers to be reinstated.
Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 26th. The Tianjin Ta Kung Pao revealed that stall vendors in Beiqian Town, Ninghe County, Jidong, held a market strike in late August to oppose the Chiang bandits' extortionate levies. The more than 30 stall vendors in the area mostly retail snacks, and their income is only enough to make a living, but the tax burden includes more than a dozen items such as "county expenses," "clothing expenses," "county subsidies," "wheat public grain," "town expenses," "bao-jia expenses," "conscription fees," and "self-defense fees," with each stall needing to pay hundreds of thousands of yuan per month. On August 27, they were notified of a "county business subsidy fee," with more than 30 stalls needing to pay a total of 30 million yuan per quarter. The vendors, unable to bear it, demanded a reduction or exemption. The Chiang bandit authorities, under the pretext of "resisting the payment of public funds," arrested Chen Xidong, a cloth vendor. The vendors were in an uproar and unanimously went on strike. The Chiang bandit authorities were forced to reduce the tax to one million yuan per month, and the situation temporarily calmed down.

    上海电力公司大罢工
    【新华社陕北二十六日电】综合各方报导：上海美商电力公司全体职工二千人，于二十三日起全体一致罢工及游行示威。以抗议上海蒋匪当局于二十日非法逮捕电力公司职工、工会职员吴可文等六人。工人为照顾市民生活，虽于罢工期间仍尽量以电力供给用户。二十三日晚全体列队前往蒋记社会局门前举行示威，要求立即释放被捕职工，但蒋家匪帮竟以镇压对付职工群众之要求，当又逮捕职工六人，二十四日宣铁吾并威胁称：“嫌疑分子将续予逮捕”；同时，蒋记社会局劳工处长沈鼎亦狂吠“总动员时期决不容许怠工罢工发生”，充分暴露法西斯匪徒们的狰狞面貌。在蒋匪当局多方摧残与压迫下，工人为争取人身自由之罢工仍坚持了二十四小时之久。另讯：法商电车公司战时被解雇雇员亦于二十四日举行示威，并包围该公司，要求复职，当遭蒋记警察之压迫，一工人被警察用刺刀刺伤，但被解雇雇员仍坚持斗争不为所动，最后迫得该公司允准工人全体复职。
    【新华社晋察冀二十六日电】津大公报透露：冀东宁河县属北堑镇摊贩，为反对蒋匪勒索摊派，曾于八月底举行罢市斗争。该地摊贩三十余家，多零售小食，收入仅能糊口，而捐税负担却有“县经费”、“服装费”、“县补助费”、“小麦公粮”、“镇经费”、“保甲经费”、“征兵费”、“自卫费”等十余种，每月每一摊竟需出款数十万元。八月二十七日又通知“县营业补助费”，三十余家每季共需缴纳三千万元，摊贩以力不能胜，要求减免。蒋匪当局竟以“抗交公款”罪名，捕去布贩陈喜东，摊贩哗然，一致罢市。蒋匪当局被迫减低该税为每月一百万，始暂告平息。
