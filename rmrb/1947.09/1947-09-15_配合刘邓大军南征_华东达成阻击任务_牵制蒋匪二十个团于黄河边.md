　　In Coordination with Liu and Deng's Army in their Southern Expedition
  　East China Completes Blockade Mission
  　Restraining Twenty Chiang Bandit Regiments on the Banks of the Yellow River
    [Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 12th] Delayed news: A portion of the East China People's Liberation Army, in coordination with Liu and Deng's army in their southern expedition, from August 3rd to 12th, blockaded the Chiang army's 5th, 75th, and 84th divisions and other units reinforcing western Shandong in the area of Wenshang and Yuncheng. After ten days and nights of fierce fighting, the blockade mission was accomplished, drawing nearly twenty regiments of Chiang's troops to the area where the Yellow River, Dongping Lake, and the Grand Canal intersect (north of Liangshan), like a herd of stupid cattle with rings through their noses, passively taking a beating, in a dilemma of advancing or retreating. In the continuous battles, the People's Liberation Army defeated the many with the few, killing over 500 enemies, including Wu Longjiang, the battalion commander of the 1st battalion of the 600th regiment of the 200th brigade of the 5th division (reorganized from the original 5th army), capturing over a hundred enemy soldiers, and seizing ten machine guns, three submachine guns, and dozens of rifles. Furthermore, the strength of seven battalions of the 5th division was shattered.
