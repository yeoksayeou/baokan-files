(Report from our Anyang correspondent) On the 13th of this month, Chiang Kai-shek's bandit army's 40th Division, in coordination with Liu Lexian's troops, totaling over 2,000 men, advanced in several directions towards our Checun, Liusi, Shenjiagang, and Qugou areas, attempting to seize grain on a large scale. Our front-line militia, work teams, the masses, and troops cooperated and fought back valiantly, launching an anti-grain-grabbing struggle against the enemy. That evening, our militia from the Fifth and Eighth Districts, in coordination with the 52nd Unit, a portion of the masses, district and village cadres, all mobilized and struck behind enemy lines in villages such as Shaocun, Liusi, and Qugou, laying landmines everywhere. The next day, over 20 enemy soldiers were killed or wounded by the mines, terrifying the enemy and preventing them from moving freely. On the roads, they wrote "Beware of Landmines" around any newly disturbed earth. They dared not come out after dark, concentrating their troops in the Liusi and Checun areas, fearing annihilation by us. We roamed every village at night, ambushing the enemy everywhere, writing slogans, posting notices, and spreading news of victories to the masses, exciting the broad masses behind enemy lines and enhancing their confidence in the victory of the anti-grain-grabbing struggle.

The Wang Panliu's persistent fight in the Eighth District, repelling three enemy encirclements, further demonstrated the heroic spirit of the cadres and militia. On the 16th, the militia of Nanguxian, in coordination with the 52nd Unit, attacked the enemy's sentries in the west of Chenjiajing and Qugou during the day, killing or wounding several. On the 16th, the county work team and the militia of the Eighth District, under the leadership of Comrades Liu Renchang and Niu Linsheng, went deep behind enemy lines to Meiyuanzhuang and Qijiazhuang, killing one enemy soldier who was seizing grain, while the rest fled. The masses warmly welcomed them. They then went to Shenjiagang Village and annihilated 14 enemies sent by the Deputy Township Chief of Wanjin Township to seize the masses' grain, creating a brilliant result of attacking behind enemy lines. The militia of the Seventh District also attacked behind enemy lines, harassing the enemy. The liberated masses in border areas such as Xiahan, Liusi, and Qugou were all transferred and organized, launching a fierce anti-grain-grabbing struggle against the enemy. They adopted the method of "enemy advances, we advance (behind enemy lines); enemy retreats, we advance," seizing every opportunity to rush-harvest. For example, on the 15th, as soon as the enemy retreated from Qugou, our militia and troops, regardless of day or night, led the masses to rush-harvest. In Xiahan, Qugou, and other villages, under armed cover, Political Commissar Gao and District Chiefs Wang and Li personally led more than 400 people to rush-harvest over 70 large cartloads in two nights. The militia of the Fourth District, combined with the masses, rush-harvested more than 360 mu in three days. In summary, in four days, there were no less than 20 frontal engagements and more than 12 activities behind enemy lines, killing or wounding more than 60 enemy soldiers (including over 30 killed or wounded by landmines), capturing seven enemies alive, severely striking the enemy's arrogance in seizing grain, and enhancing the confidence in the victory of the anti-grain-grabbing struggle among the masses in the border areas. The masses and militia cooperated well in an organized manner during the transfer. The militia did not leave the masses, and the people did not leave the armed forces. After the transfer, they did not move far from their own areas, still monitoring the enemy in the border areas, understanding the situation, and seizing every opportunity to rush-harvest. For example, as soon as the enemy left Qugou on a certain day, the militia led the masses to follow and rush-harvest. The main reasons for achieving these victories are:

1.  Cadres took the lead, with determination, confidence, and boldness to go deep behind enemy lines. When the enemy advanced, we advanced; when the enemy retreated, we advanced. The militia were active behind enemy lines everywhere, forcing the enemy to concentrate their forces as soon as it got dark, not daring to come out, which further facilitated our activities.

2.  Good combination with the masses behind enemy lines, relying on and trusting the masses, boldly going deep behind enemy lines to support the masses and eliminate harm (such as the killing of grain-grabbing enemies in Zhidu, and the annihilation battle in Shenjiagang), making the masses more trusting of us, relying on us, and even automatically sending us information and leading the way. Two young people from ×× village even helped us fight guerrillas.

3.  Landmine explosions played a certain role. In the first two days, over 30 enemy soldiers were killed or wounded, terrifying the enemy and preventing them from acting rashly. (Communication Group of the Military Affairs Committee)

(Report from our Tangyin correspondent) On the 9th, over a hundred men under Wang Huaimi, carrying two machine guns and one small cannon, came to our area of Longhua and Mufo to seize grain and conscript soldiers. At 11:00 AM, they were repelled by our Independent Detachment of the Work Team. The enemy counterattacked twice, reoccupying Longhua and Mufo, and advanced towards Baijiaying. Our Independent Detachment immediately organized a second offensive, using hand grenades to defeat the enemy. We pursued them directly to the enemy's base in Hua'erzhuang Village, burning down seven blockhouses, killing two enemies. The masses applauded and cheered. An old lady, seeing the blockhouses emitting smoke, said, "Look there, they're burning bricks for us!" This initial victory in defending the autumn harvest was praised by the County Headquarters.

(Report from our correspondent) On the morning of September 10th, after breakfast, a part of the enemy and puppet troops from Yuanshi, with a force of about one battalion, came to Songcao, Wangzhuang, Jian'an, and other villages to seize grain. The militia of Gaoyizhuang, in order to protect the autumn harvest, assisted the militia of the Seventh District of Yuanshi in combat. They ambushed the enemy on the kiln between the west of Jian'an Village and the east of Wangsong Village. The enemy tried to encircle us in a fan shape, but after our militia's resistance, they immediately collapsed and retreated. We wounded two enemy soldiers and safely withdrew from the position. Only the director of our Military Affairs Committee suffered minor injuries. (Production News)

    到处袭敌遍地埋雷
    安阳军民英勇护粮
    汤阴独立支队护粮连捷
    【本报安阳讯】本月十三号，安阳蒋匪军四十师配合刘乐仙部共两千余人，分数路向我车村、流寺，申家岗，曲沟一带进犯，企图大肆抢粮。我前线民兵武工队群众与部队配合，奋起应战，与敌展开反抢粮斗争。当晚我五、八区民兵配合五二部及一部群众、区村干部、一齐出动，打到敌后邵村、流寺、曲沟等村，遍地埋设了地雷，第二天即炸死伤敌二十余人，炸的敌人胆战心惊，不敢行走，在路上每见新土地一圈，写上“小心地雷”，天黑即不敢出来，把兵都集中到流寺、车村一带，怕被我消灭。我们黑夜遍游各村，到处袭敌，写标语、贴布告，向群众宣传胜利消息，兴奋了敌后广大群众，提高了反抢粮斗争的胜利信心。
    八区王潘流的坚持战，打退敌人三次包围，更表现干部民兵英勇精神。十六日南固现民兵配合五二部白天到陈家井西曲沟，打死伤敌人哨兵数名。十六日县武工队、八区民兵在刘仁昌、牛林生二同志领导下，深入敌后梅元庄、戚家庄活动，打死抢粮敌一名，其余逃窜，群众热烈欢迎。又到申家岗村，将万金乡副乡长派来抢收群众谷子的十四个敌人击毙，创造敌后出击光耀战果。七区民兵也曾出击敌后，袭扰敌人，夏寒、流寺、曲沟等边沿区翻身群众都转移出来，进行了组织，与敌展开激烈的反抢粮斗争，他们采取了敌进我进（到敌后），敌退我进的干法，抓紧一点空隙，进行抢收。如十五日曲沟敌人刚一退走，我民兵部队即不分昼夜，带领群众前去抢收。夏寒、曲沟等村在武装掩护下，高政委，王、李二区长亲自带领群众四百余人，两夜抢收七十余大车。四区民兵结合群众，三天中即抢收三百六十余亩。总结四天中正面作战不下二十来次，敌后活动十二次之多，杀伤敌人六十余名（内有地雷炸死伤三十余人），活捉敌人七名，痛击了抢粮敌人的凶焰，提高了边沿区群众反抢粮斗争的胜利信心。群众民兵转移有组织互相配合的好，民兵不离群众，老百姓不离武装，转移出后，没远离自己地区，仍在边地监视敌人，了解情况，随时随地抽空都可抢收，如×日曲沟敌人一走，民兵带领群众跟踪抢收。取得这些胜利的主要原因：
    一、干部带头，有决心、有信心、大胆深入敌后，敌进我进，敌退我进，民兵到处活跃敌后，使敌人天一黑便将兵力集中起来，不敢出来，这样更便利了我们的活动。
    二、与敌后群众结合好，依靠相信的群众，大胆深入敌后，给群众撑腰除害，（如置度打死抢粮敌人，申家岗的消灭战）使群众更相信我们，依靠我们，以至自动的给我们送情报、带路，××村的两个青年，还帮助我们打游击。
    三、地雷爆炸起了一定作用，头两天敌人即被炸伤亡三十余人，炸的敌人胆战心惊，不敢随便行动。（武委会通信组）
    【本报汤阴讯】九号敌王怀秘部下百余人，携机枪两挺小炮一门，到我地区隆化木佛抢粮抓丁，上午十一点被我武工队独立支队击退。敌人又二次反扑，重占隆化木佛，向白家营前进，我独立支队即二次组织进攻，用手榴弹打垮敌人，我直追至敌人驻地花耳庄庄，烧掉炮楼七座，毙敌二名，群众拍手欢迎，老太太瞧见炮楼冒烟说：“看那里给咱烧砖哩！”这初次保卫秋收战的胜利，荣获县指挥部的表扬。（汤阴小报）
    【本报讯】九月十日早饭后，元氏敌伪一部，约有一营兵力到宋曹、王庄、建安等村抢粮，高邑庄民兵为了保护秋收，援助元氏七区民兵作战，在建安村西、王宋村东中间之窑上，给敌以当头射击，敌人向我取扇面包围，经我民兵阻击，当即溃退，我打伤敌人二名，安全撤出阵地，我仅武委会主任微带小伤。（生产报）
