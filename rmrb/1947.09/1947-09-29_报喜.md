　　On the 20th at dusk, the messenger delivering the newspaper had just entered the Fengyu Village Elementary School gate when the teachers and students all snatched the Xinhua Daily. "Hey! Our army's large-scale counteroffensive has begun!" After a burst of excitement, the students immediately formed a good news reporting team to spread the news to the farmers' homes. The villagers had just returned from sowing wheat. The good news team entered the home of Li Erhu, a liberated old peasant. Old Man Li hurriedly offered them seats, "What's the matter? Tell us quickly." "Reporting good news!" The students waved the newspaper happily in front of Old Man Li's face. The old lady, daughter-in-law, and daughter Hehua, who were shelling beans on the side, dropped their beans and all squeezed over at once. Old Man Li said, "Hehua, light the lamp quickly!" Student Zhang Yuhuai unfolded the newspaper with a flourish. Old Man Li smiled, his face full of wrinkles: "Ah! Words as big as walnuts." The old and young women stared at the newspaper without blinking. After reading a section, they all happily said, "We're about to hit Nanjing!" Everyone laughed. The old lady said, "Oh my, oh my, we'll be too happy to sleep tonight." Old Man Li said, "Tomorrow I will sow another four mu of wheat to contribute as military grain." He faced the students and his family and said, "If you don't uproot Chiang Kai-shek, that big turnip, we poor people will be under his rule forever, hahahaha..."

　　The good news team walked out of the gate, and before they could go to each household, they were surrounded by people in the street with lanterns and torches, packed in tightly.

    报喜
    二十号黄昏，送报的交通员刚走进风峪村高小大门，师生们一下就都把新华日报抢去了。“嘿！我军大举反攻开始。”大家热闹了一气，同学们马上组成报喜小组，到各农家去报喜。老乡们种麦刚回来。报喜小组进了翻身老农李二虎家，李老汉急忙让坐，“什么事，快给咱拉拉吧。”“报喜哩”。同学们拿着报在李老汉脸前高兴的晃了几晃。正在一边撕豆荚的老太太、媳妇、闺女荷花，丢开豆荚，一下子都挤过来了。老汉说：“荷花快点灯！”同学张玉怀一往开展报，李老汉笑的满脸圪皱皮：“呀！核桃大的字。”老少娘们眼不打转的盯着报纸。念罢一段，都高兴的说：“快打到南京啦！”大家都笑了。老太太说：“哟哟呀，今黑夜咱可高兴的万万睡不着。”李老汉说：“我明天还要多种它四亩麦，好交军粮。”他脸向着同学和家里的人们说：“你不说刨了蒋介石这个大蔓菁，咱穷人可就要永辈坐朝廷，哈哈哈哈……”
    报喜小组走出大门，简直是来不及去各家户，可就让街上的人们灯笼火把的给围了个水泄不通。
