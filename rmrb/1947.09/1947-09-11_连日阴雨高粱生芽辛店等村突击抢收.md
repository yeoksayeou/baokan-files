Continuous Rain Causes Sprouting in Sorghum; Xindian and Other Villages Rush to Harvest
[Our newspaper's report from Southern Hebei, 9th] Recently, due to excessive rain, sorghum is sprouting. The masses in Xindian and Taozhai are rushing to harvest. In Weixian County, the mutual aid group of Lü Huairen in Xindian Village had all their sorghum knocked down by a violent wind and rain. Consequently, the entire village began a massive rush to harvest the sorghum, saying, "Everyone knows to harvest at seven or eight tenths ripeness. Since the weather isn't clear, let's harvest quickly!" After discussion, everyone went to the fields and managed to harvest ten mu of sorghum in one and a half days. This time, it has been continuously overcast for seven days, and many sprouts have grown on the sorghum in the fields. Those who started late felt they were at a disadvantage and also began rushing to harvest. The mutual aid group of labor hero Wang Dianchen in Taozhai Village, Qiu County, discussed the autumn harvest and said, "Most of the sorghum is ripe, so we must rush to harvest it to prevent reduced yields due to excessive rain." They decided that out of the group's thirteen people, the number engaged in sideline occupations would be reduced from three to two, leaving two people to feed the livestock and cook, while the remaining nine would all go to the fields to rush the autumn harvest. Their group has a total of one hundred and forty-three mu of sorghum and millet, requiring four hundred and twenty-nine labor days and fifty-two oxen days. The nine people can complete the rush harvest, including bringing the firewood home, in ten days.

　　连日阴雨高粱生芽辛店等村突击抢收
    【本报冀南九日电】最近雨多，高粱长芽，辛店、桃砦群众突击抢收中。威县辛店吕怀仁互助组，因一场狂风暴雨把高粱都吹倒了，于是全村就大量抢收高粱，都说：“谁不知道七分熟，八分收，天又不晴，快收吧！”经过讨论，就都下地，一天半突击收完十亩高粱。这次一直连阴了七天，地里的高粱长了很多芽子，下手晚的人都觉着吃了亏，也都进行抢收。邱县桃砦村劳动英雄王殿臣的互助组，讨论秋收，都说：“高粱大部熟了，得赶快抢收，以防雨多歉收。”决议全组十三个人，搞副业由三个人减成两个人，留两个人喂牲口做饭，其余九个人全部下地突击秋收。他们组共有高粱、谷子一百四十三亩，得用四百二十九个人工、五十二个牛工，收割到柴草回家，九个人十天就可突击完。
