Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th: TASS issued a statement from Moscow on the 28th, pointing out that the Chiang government's closure of the port of Dalian violates the provisions of the Sino-Soviet Treaty. The statement reads as follows: "Chinese newspapers have published news of the Chinese Executive Yuan's decision to close the port of Dalian and that foreign ships without special permission from the Chinese authorities are not allowed to enter the port. TASS is authorized to declare on this news in the Chinese newspapers: In accordance with Article 4 of the Sino-Soviet Treaty concerning the port of Dalian: Before the conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan, the port of Dalian is under the jurisdiction of the regime established in the Lushun Naval Base area. Even though, due to certain situations not caused by Soviet actions, the port of Dalian has not been open to trade and navigation for all countries as stipulated in the Sino-Soviet Treaty of August 1945, Soviet ships have the undeniable right to enter the port under the aforementioned provisions." (Note: The Chiang government announced the "blockade of the port of Dalian" on the 21st of this month, prohibiting any ships from entering or leaving without its permission. A week before this, the US government had requested the Soviet Union to "open Dalian" on the 14th.)

    蒋介石封闭大连港　违反中苏条约规定
    【新华社陕北三十日电】塔斯社二十八日自莫斯科发表声明，指出蒋政府封闭大连港口一事，乃违反中苏条约规定。声明文如下：“中国报纸上刊载中国行政院决定封闭大连港，及未经中国当局特许之外国船只不得进入该港之消息。塔斯社奉命就中国报纸此项消息声明：遵照苏中条约有关大连港的第四条：在对日和约缔订前，大连港受建立于旅顺口海军基地区的政权管辖，纵然由于若干并非苏联行动引起的情势，大连港迄未如一九四五年八月苏中条约所规定是对一切国家开放贸易和航行，但是苏联船只根据上述条款，有无可争辩的进入该港之权利。”（按：蒋政府曾于本月二十一日宣布“封锁大连港”，禁止未经其许可的任何船只进出。在这前一周，美政府曾于十四日要求苏联“开放大连”。）
