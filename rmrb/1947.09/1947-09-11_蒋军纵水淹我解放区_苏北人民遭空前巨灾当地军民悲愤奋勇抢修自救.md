Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 8th: A reporter from the Northern Jiangsu branch revealed the heinous crime of the Chiang-puppet troops in Huaiyin-Haizhou deliberately creating a major flood in sixteen rivers in the region (Note: The Huaihai Liberated Area is located south of the Longhai Railway, north of the Yanhai River, and between the Grand Canal and the Yellow Sea), inundating eight-tenths of the area. They stated that since July, the Shuh River, Yi River, Shajian River, Liutang River, Chaimi River, and other large and small rivers, sixteen in total, have successively burst their banks, with as many as twenty-six major breaches. Among these, eighteen breaches, accounting for seven-tenths of the total, directly resulted in major disasters due to the sabotage and obstruction by Chiang-puppet troops. The methods of destruction employed by the Chiang-puppet troops were fourfold: First, deliberate breaching for flooding. On July 9th, Chiang's 51st Division, 41st Brigade stationed in Xin'an Town, eastern section of Longhai Railway, taking advantage of the post-rain surge in the Shuh River, breached the embankment east of the town, causing the river water to flow southwest through Zhaodun Lake directly into the Luoma River, turning an area of more than twenty miles east-west and fifty miles north-south along the river into a watery expanse. On the 19th of the same month, Chiang-puppet troops at the Shizibao (Cross Bridge) of the Huaiyin-Shuyang Highway dug a two-hundred-zhang breach in the left bank of the Dajian River embankment. The masses attempted to repair the breach three times but were obstructed by the Chiang-puppet artillery fire from the north bank of the river. The resulting flood inundated 180,000 mu of fertile land in Chaimihe and other areas, where the water level was a zhang deep on the plains. Two days later, the Chiang-puppet troops in the area breached the embankment again, this time by thirty zhang. Second, building dams to block the flow. Within the territory of Guanyun, the downstream and estuaries of the Chaimi, Dongmen, Hanyang, and Chi Rivers were all blocked by the Chiang-puppet troops, causing the river to overflow after heavy rains. Thirty-five out of thirty-seven townships in the county were inundated, resulting in the most severe disaster in decades. Third, obstructing dike repairs. For instance, the masses usually repaired the Jinjiakou sluice gate of the Liutang River in Huaiyin before the annual floods. This summer, construction was impossible due to shooting by two hundred Chiang-puppet troops from Lianshui. The masses had no choice but to build a dike at Dingzigou downstream, but on August 7th, the Liutang River surged, bursting through the Jinjiakou sluice gate, and the new dike at Dingzigou was immediately washed away. Several attempts by the masses to repair it were unsuccessful, and a large area between the Yang River and Liutang River was flooded. Fourth, seizing relief supplies, failing to provide assistance during danger, leading to major disasters. Last summer, the Chiang troops stationed in Dongmei and Xinpu blocked the drainage of the Liutang River and Shuh River into the sea, causing a major flood in the area. To this day, several sections of the Mu River and Yi River are still occupied by the Chiang-puppet troops. Although they possess a large quantity of UNRRA-supplied water conservancy equipment and materials, they are engaged in corruption at all levels and disregard many dangerous projects. This spring, the democratic government made great efforts to repair the dikes, but they were destroyed by frequent "sweeps" by the Chiang-puppet troops, causing the breaches from last autumn to become major disasters again this summer. The reporter stated: Under the urgent call of the democratic government, two million military personnel and civilians in the nine counties of Huaihai are now fighting the floods with tenacious spirit. Flood prevention teams are organized in all dangerous areas, patrolling the dikes day and night. When a breach is discovered, gongs are sounded to alert the nearby villages to gather for rescue and embankment construction. When the Shajian River in Chuancheng District of Sixian County burst at night, more than eighty people from Minsheng and other three villages braved the storm, jumped into the water, and dug mud by hand to form a one-li-long earthen levee to block the river water. Disaster victims in Suqian, Guanyun, and other counties are actively organizing production for self-relief, repairing dikes and preventing floods on one hand, and fishing on the other, and preparing seeds for autumn vegetables to be sown as soon as the water recedes. Lianshui called on everyone to prepare one hundred catties of vegetables to survive the famine, and areas with lighter disasters sent buckwheat and vegetable seeds to areas with severe disasters. The Central County Committee of the First County of Huaihai of the Communist Party of China called on party members to perform meritorious service for the people in disaster relief.

　　蒋军纵水淹我解放区
  　苏北人民遭空前巨灾当地军民悲愤奋勇抢修自救
    【新华社华中八日电】苏北分社记者揭露淮（阴）海（州）蒋伪军制造该区（按淮海解放区位于陇海路南盐河以北，运河、黄海之间）十六条河大水灾，淹没该地区十分之八面积之残暴罪行称：七月以来，沭河、沂河、砂碱、六塘、柴米等大小十六条河相继决堤，较大决口达二十六处。其中直接受蒋伪军破坏阻扰而成巨灾者十八处，达全部决口十分之七。蒋伪军破坏方式有四种：其一、为决堤放水。七月九日陇海东段新安镇蒋军五十一师四一旅乘雨后沭河暴涨之际，于镇东路塘决堤，河水向西南经赵墩湖直奔骆马河，沿河东西二十余里、南北五十里尽成泽国。同月十九日，淮（阴）沭（阳）公路十字桥蒋伪军将大涧河左河口堤挖了二百余丈，群众三次抢险均为河北岸蒋伪炮火所阻，大水所至，柴米河南平地水深一丈。二日后该地蒋伪军又决堤三十余丈，淹没蒲塘等十八万亩良田。其二、为打坝阻流。灌云境内柴米、东门、涵养、池河等下游及入海口尽为蒋伪军堵塞，以致大雨后，水溢河床，该县三十七个乡中三十五乡一片汪洋，灾情严重为数十年来所未有。其三、为阻挠修堤。如淮阴、六塘河每年总泛前群众照例堵修金家口水闸，今夏因遭涟水二百蒋伪射击无法兴工；群众不得已乃改于下游丁字沟筑堤，但八月七日六塘河水大涨，夺金家口水闸而出，丁字沟新堤即为冲倒。群众几次抢险无效，洋河、六塘河间大地区被淹没。其四、把持救济物资，见险不救，致酿成巨灾。去夏盘踞东每、新浦之蒋军阻塞六塘河、沭河排水入海，曾造成该区大泛滥，迄今沐河，沂河等仍有数段为蒋伪占踞，彼等虽把有联总大批量兴建水利器材与物资，但却上下贪污，置多处险工于不顾。今春民主政府曾以大力修堤然为蒋伪频繁“扫荡”所破坏，以致去秋决堤处今夏又成巨灾。记者称：淮海九县二百万军民在民主政府紧急号召下，现正以顽强精神与洪水搏斗。各险工地带均组织防水队，日夜巡逻河堤，发现缺口即鸣锣告警，齐集邻近乡村救援堵筑。泗沭县川城区砂碱河黑夜决口时，民生等三村八十余群众冒狂风暴雨，跳入水中用手挖泥，打成一里长之土埝，挡住河水。宿迁、灌云等县灾民积极组织生产自救，一面打堤防水，一面捕鱼，并预备好秋菜种子，待水一退即行播种。涟水号召每人备好蔬菜一百斤渡荒，灾轻区纷以荞麦，菜种赠送灾重区。中共淮海第一县中心县委会号召党员在救灾中为人民立功。
