　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 5th. News from the United States confirms that in the eyes of American imperialists, China - including the Northeast and Xinjiang - has become a "strategic zone" that American imperialists are determined to obtain. Based on the demand to destroy China, American imperialists are prepared to expand assistance to the traitor Chiang Kai-shek in carrying out the civil war and slaughtering the Chinese people. According to a special dispatch from New York by the Central News Agency on the 1st, citing a report from Nanjing by New York Times reporter Liebermann, "Although Wedemeyer has publicly criticized the Chiang Kai-shek regime, it is no secret that China, especially Manchuria, is economically and politically extremely important to the US Pacific strategy." Liebermann cited the following points to explain China's strategic importance to the United States, fully exposing the ferocious face of American imperialism in destroying China, namely, first, "Manchuria is located next to US-occupied Japan," which American imperialists covet; second, "Manchuria and Xinjiang are possible fighter bases on the way to the Soviet Union's industry and the important Lake Baikal," revealing the secret of the United States seizing Xi'an, Lanzhou, Dihua and other places as communist bases; third, "China possesses a rich treasure of manpower," and American imperialists vainly attempt to turn the 480 million Chinese people into its colonial slaves; fourth, "In addition to Manchuria's resources, mainland China also possesses many important strategic materials, such as tungsten, antimony, tin, and possibly molybdenum," proving that American imperialism's aggression against China is comprehensive; fifth, "China also has rich market potential," and the United States wants to turn China into a colonial market. Liebermann pointed out that, based on the above reasons, the United States is considering strengthening its assistance to Chiang Kai-shek.

　　美垂涎中国战略基地
    必将扩大援蒋打内战
    【新华社陕北五日电】来自美国消息证实，在美国帝国主义者心目中，中国——包括东北及新疆在内——已成为美帝国主义必欲得之而后甘心的“战略地带”。基于灭亡中国的要求，美帝国主义者准备扩大援助卖国贼蒋介石进行内战，屠杀中国人民。据中央社一日自纽约发专电所引纽约时报记者莱柏门自南京报导称：“虽然魏德迈曾公开抨击蒋介石政权，但是中国特别是满洲对美国太平洋战略在经济上和政治上极关重要却非秘密”。莱柏门举出如下几点来解释中国对美国战略的重要性，充分暴露出美帝国主义灭亡中国的凶恶面目，即第一、“满洲位于美国占领的日本之侧”，美帝国主义者对之垂涎三尺；第二、“满洲与新疆是到苏联工业和重要的贝加尔湖的航线途中可能的战斗机基地”，道出了美国攫取西安、兰州、迪化等地为共军基地的秘密；第三、“中国拥有丰富的人力宝藏”，美帝国主义妄图把四亿八千万中国人民变为它的殖民地奴隶；第四、“除满洲的富源以外，中国本部还拥有许多重要战略物资，如钨、锑、锡可能还有钼”，证明美帝国主义对华的侵略是全面的；第五、“中国并有丰富的市场潜力”，美国要把中国变为殖民地市场。莱柏门指出，基于上述理由，美国正在考虑加强对蒋介石的援助。
