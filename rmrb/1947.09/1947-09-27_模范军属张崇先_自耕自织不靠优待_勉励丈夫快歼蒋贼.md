    Model Military Dependent Zhang Chongxian
    Farming and Weaving Independently, Not Relying on Preferential Treatment
    Encouraging Husband to Quickly Annihilate Chiang's Bandits
    [This newspaper's report from Licheng] Zhang Chongxian, a model military dependent from Dongguan, District One, married Yang Fushan in June 1943. The following year, she encouraged her husband to join the army. Although she was alone at home and not physically strong, she frequently worked in the fields and refused to be idle. Last year, after the land reform, she was allocated four fen of vegetable plot, which she always watered herself. She often worked with the mutual aid team in the fields, doing what she could on her own without asking for help. During the drought, she exchanged labor with the mutual aid team to water more than one mu of corn. To overcome the famine, she organized six women to cultivate one mu of wasteland, which has been planted with rapeseed. Last autumn, she organized five women to harvest more than two mu of sorghum for Anti-Wang Bing. This autumn, she plans to not only harvest her own four and a half mu of land but also help Wang Bing with his harvest. This spring, she bought a loom and wove more than eight zhang of cloth. She said, "I have no difficulties at all, and I don't have to worry about food and clothing. This year, I must achieve 'three parts farming, one part surplus.'" She came from a poor family and has a high level of class consciousness. Last year, during the land reform, the masses selected her as an activist. Recently, she also joined the night spinning group, spinning three liang of cotton each night. She often writes to her husband. In a letter she wrote during the August 1st Army Day commemoration, in addition to describing how the masses at home cared for military dependents, she also said that she hoped they would cross the Yellow River and quickly eliminate Chiang Kai-shek, and protect the fruits of our liberation. She is kind to people and upright in her daily life. The villagers all agree that Zhang Chongxian is truly a model military dependent. (Hong Sheng, Xiao Jiao, Wei Xin)
