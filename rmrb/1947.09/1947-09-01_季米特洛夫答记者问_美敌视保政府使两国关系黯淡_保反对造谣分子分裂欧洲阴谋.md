Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, August 28th: Sofia dispatch: On the 23rd, Bulgarian Prime Minister Dimitrov, in reply to questions from Mr. Peace, a reporter for the American Saturday Evening Post, stated: Current Bulgarian-American economic and political relations are not good, but it is hoped that they can be improved. The United States has so far sealed up Bulgaria's pre-war assets in the United States, preventing Bulgaria from using them to purchase machinery and other industrial products from the United States. The American political representative in Bulgaria, Barnes, is hostile to the Bulgarian government and acts as an advisor to the reactionaries. This greatly reduces the credibility of the United States among the Bulgarian people and darkens bilateral relations as a result. Dimitrov strongly stated that Bulgaria is eager to establish normal and friendly diplomatic relations with the United States and expand trade relations between the two countries, but cannot accept political constraints detrimental to sovereignty as a condition for exchange. In response to a question about what role Bulgaria can play in European reconstruction, Dimitrov said that Bulgaria will engage in promoting trade cooperation between Eastern and Western Europe and resolutely oppose splitting Europe into Eastern and Western blocs, therefore refusing to participate in the Paris Conference convened by Bevin and Bidault. Bulgaria has no intention of participating in the fabricated "Eastern European Group," such as the "Balkan Group," the "Slavic Group," and the "Danube Group," by rumor-mongers. Regarding Bulgaria's future prospects, Dimitrov said: Bulgaria may transition to socialism without going through the dictatorship of the proletariat, but this depends on the attitude of various capitalist countries towards Bulgaria.

　　季米特洛夫答记者问
  　美敌视保政府使两国关系黯淡
    保反对造谣分子分裂欧洲阴谋
    【新华社陕北二十八日电】索菲亚讯：二十三日，保总理季米特洛夫答复美国星期六晚邮报记者皮斯所提之问题称：目前保美经济、政治关系均欠良好，但希望能获改善。美国迄今仍封存保国战前在美资产，使保国不能用其向美国购买机械与其他工业品。美国驻保政治代表巴恩斯敌视保政府，而为反动派充作顾问，这大大降低美国在保国人民中之信誉，使两国关系因之黯淡。季氏力称：保国亟愿与美国建立正常友好之邦交，扩大两国贸易关系，但不能接受有损主权之政治束缚以为交换条件。季氏于回答保国对欧洲重建能起何等作用时称：保国将从事促进东西欧在贸易方面之合作，并坚决反对将欧洲分裂为东西二集团，因此拒绝参加贝文与比道尔所召开之巴黎会议。保国无意参加造谣分子臆造之“东欧集团，”诸如“巴尔干集团”、“斯拉夫集团”、“多脑河集团”等。关于保国前途之展望，季氏说：保国可能不经过无产阶级专政而过渡到社会主义，但这须视各资本主义国家对保国之态度如何而定。
