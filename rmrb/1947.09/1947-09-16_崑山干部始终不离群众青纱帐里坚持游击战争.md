[Reported by this newspaper from the Jilu豫 area on the 14th] The Kunshan County guerrilla force, under the harassment of Chiang's Fifth Army and Wu Huawen's puppet troops, totaling more than 30,000 men, continues its work as usual. Government orders are implemented without obstruction, the people's hearts are stable throughout the area, and revolutionary order is good. From August 7th to 18th, Chiang's Fifth Army and Chiang's puppet army Wu Huawen's one division, totaling more than 30,000 men, again invaded the triangular area south of the Yellow River and west of the Grand Canal. Comrade Zhu Hua, Secretary of the Kunshan Sixth District Party Committee, and the head of the Sixth District, led the cadres to steadfastly hold their ground until the enemy retreated. Before the enemy's large army arrived, they ideologically determined to persist in guerrilla warfare. First, they properly arranged for the elderly and weak and established a militia backbone platoon, scattering during the day and concentrating at night. When a certain unit of our army blocked Chiang's Fifth Army from advancing, the Sixth District was surrounded on three sides by the enemy. In the green crops, enemy shells flew over their heads, but they calmly held their ground, not eating a single meal for three days. After our army completed its blocking mission and transferred, all the villages in the Sixth District were occupied by the enemy. They moved between the tall sorghum fields of various villages, persisting in the struggle, and their determination to coexist with the people became even stronger. They secretly spread government orders to various villages, stabilizing the people's hearts. They joined forces with the militias from the southeast of Huangzhuang to the low-lying area and Zhouzhuang and other villages. They immediately built small sheds with sorghum leaves in the sorghum fields as temporary command posts. At that time, they received news that the enemy was seizing grain in the villages, and the landlord had the militia squad's cattle taken away by the enemy. They immediately told the militia to return to the village and convey the district headquarters' order to every household: "Those who aid the enemy will be killed without exception!" And they told the militia to tell the landlord of the village: "If the militia squad's cattle are not brought back, we will knock you down!" The next day, the landlord did indeed ask for the cattle back. At night, they secretly entered various villages and openly told the landlords: "The district is not gone, whoever dares to do bad things, be careful!" Therefore, none of the landlords in the entire district dared to act recklessly. The masses were extremely excited and told each other: "Our district is not gone, don't be afraid!" Therefore, the people's hearts were stable throughout the district, and government orders could still be implemented without obstruction. The masses saw with their own eyes the hard struggle of our guerrilla force, fearing no sacrifice and protecting their interests. They were greatly moved and secretly sent watermelons to the sorghum fields to express their condolences. Then the enemy carried out "mopping-up" operations, but with the cover and assistance of the broad masses, the "mopping-up" operations failed again. On August 18th, before most of the enemy had retreated, they convened a village cadre reunion meeting in the entire district to arrange for capturing small groups of enemies, and the people's enthusiasm became even higher.

[Reported by this newspaper from the Jilu豫 area on the 14th] The Yuncheng Fifth District guerrilla force, adhering to the principle of "the enemy advances, we advance," carried out land distribution during guerrilla activities. On August 11th, when the enemy troops jointly attacked Yuncheng, they pushed the cadres of our Fifth District out of the district, but they sneaked back in that night, adhering to the principle of "the enemy advances, we advance." When the first batch of enemies had not completely left, and the second batch had not followed up, our guerrilla force seized the gap to carry out land reform work. Land reform struggles were launched in one-third of the administrative villages in the district, clearing out 16,843 catties of floating wealth and grain, and seven carts. Then the second batch of enemies passed through the border and retreated south. The cadres of the Sixth District persisted in the struggle from beginning to end, grasped the rural position, suppressed the bad elements, and defended the interests of the broad masses.

　　崑山干部始终不离群众青纱帐里坚持游击战争
    【本报冀鲁豫十四日电】＠山县游击队，在蒋五军及吴逆化文三万余人袭扰之下，仍照常坚持工作，政令推行无阻，全区人心稳定，革命秩序良好。八月七日至十八日，蒋五军及蒋伪军吴逆化文一个师共三万余人，再次侵入我黄河以南运河以西之三角地带，我＠山六区分委书记朱华同志和六区区长，率领干部始终坚持阵地，直至敌人撤退为止。他们在敌大军来到以前，即从思想上确定坚持游击战的决心，首先将老弱安插好，并成立了民兵精干排，白天分散，晚上集中。当我大军某部阻击蒋五军前进时，六区三面受敌包围，他们在青纱帐内，敌方炮弹从头顶飞过，他们仍沉着坚持阵地，三天未吃到一顿饭。我大军完成阻击任务转移之后，六区全部村庄，都被敌人占领，他们便辗转于各村庄之间的高粮地内坚持斗争，与人民共存亡的意志更加坚定，且秘密向各村传布政令，稳定民心。他们在黄庄东南至洼地里和周庄等村之民兵汇合，立即在高粱地里用高粱叶搭成小棚，作临时指挥部，当时得到消息敌人在村里抢粮，地主并将民兵班的牛给敌拉走，他们立即告诉民兵，回村挨家传达区部命令：“如有资敌者，决杀不侥！”并让民兵告诉该庄地主：“民兵班的牛如不拉回来，一定敲掉你！”第二天地主果然将牛要了回来。夜里秘密进入各庄，公开告诉地主说：“区里没有走，谁要坏了当心点！”因此全区地主，无一敢蠢动者，群众兴奋异常，互相传告说：“咱区里没有走，不要怕！”因而全区人心稳定，政令仍能推行无阻。群众亲眼看到我游击队艰苦奋斗，不怕任何牺牲、保护他们的利益，大受感动，均偷偷送西瓜到高粱地内慰问。接着敌人即进行“清剿”，但我游击队在广大群众的掩护与帮助下，“清剿”又告失败。八月十八日，大部敌人尚未退走，他们即召集了全区的村干团圆会，布置捉小股敌人，群众情绪更加高涨。
    【本报冀鲁豫十四日电】郓城五区游击队，坚持敌进我进方针，在游击活动中进行分田。八月十一日，敌军一路合犯郓城时，将我五区干部，压出了区境，但当晚又钻了进去，坚持了敌进我进方针，当敌人头批未走完，二批没跟上时，我游击队即抓紧空隙，作土改工作，在全区三分之一的行政村中开展土改斗争，清理了浮财粮食一万六千八百四十三斤，大车七辆。接着第二批敌人过境南退，六部分干部始终坚持了斗争，掌握了农村阵地，镇压了坏分子，保卫了广大群众利益。
