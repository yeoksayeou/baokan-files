    A Certain Commander Comments on the Eastern Hebei Victory:
    A Head-On Blow to Chen Cheng
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, September 27th] A frontline commander of a certain unit of the Hebei-Chahar-Rehe-Liaoning People's Liberation Army, commenting to reporters on our army's battle on the 16th, in which the enemy's 93rd Army's Provisional 22nd Division and part of the Provisional 50th Division were annihilated, said: This victory was a kick in the backside to Chen Cheng, who had just taken office. After Du Yuming was kicked out and Chen Cheng came in, in order to save the military crisis in the Northeast, he attempted to launch a partial offensive to protect the only lifeline connecting the Northeast to North China, the Beining Railway. Therefore, starting from September 6th, he advanced from Jinzhou to Shanhaiguan in three routes towards our Eastern Hebei and Western Liaoning base areas. The left route, originating from Suizhong, consisted of the main force of the Provisional 50th Division's First and Second Regiments (reorganized from the Northeast Security Force's First District), advancing towards Lishugoumen. The central route was the Provisional 60th Division (also reorganized from the Security Force), advancing from Xingcheng towards Xintaimen. The right route, from the Jinzhou line via Hongluoxian and Jiangjiatun, was the main force of the 93rd Army's Provisional 22nd Division, advancing towards Xintaimen, attempting to use Jiangjiatun, Xintaimen, and Lishugoumen as bases to advance westward. The three routes of Chiang bandits arrived at the aforementioned locations on the 7th. The 93rd Army's Provisional 22nd Division, in preparation for a long-term "mopping-up" operation, specially transported a large amount of grain and ammunition from Jinzhou to Jinxi by train to Yangzhangzi. Each route also brought along local bullies, landlords, hooligans, beggar gangs, and other bandits, committing all kinds of evil deeds wherever they went, including rape and looting. After learning of the enemy's intention, a part of our powerful field army marched rapidly, day and night, to rescue the people. Starting at dawn on the 14th, our army took the initiative to concentrate its forces to fiercely attack the Chiang bandits at Lishugoumen on the left route. The battle ended at 5:00 PM, inflicting a devastating blow on the enemy's Provisional 50th Division, annihilating more than 2,000 enemy troops. We captured 628 enemy soldiers, killed and wounded over 400 enemy soldiers, and captured Zhang Weishi, the head of the reactionary landlord armed suppression team. Our encircling forces, arriving near Yangzhangzi, arrived one after another at 11:00 AM on the 16th. The general offensive was launched at 2:00 PM, and by 3:30 PM, the main positions on the east and west sides of the enemy were captured, breaking down their entire defense system. The bandit army's camp immediately appeared chaotic. Our army then launched a joint attack on the huge and fortified buildings of the Yangzhangzi factory. The enemy troops breaking out were annihilated and captured by our first, second, and third encirclement forces. The battle ended at noon. In total, this campaign killed and wounded over 1,000 enemy soldiers and captured 3,560 enemy soldiers. Together with the Lishugoumen battle, a total of 4,602 enemy soldiers were annihilated and captured. This battle was our first blow to Chen Cheng, completely and thoroughly crushing the "offensive" he personally arranged. The American weapons captured in this battle can equip two more full regiments of our army.

    某指挥员评热东大捷称
    是给陈诚当头一棒
    【新华社东北二十七日电】冀察热辽人民解放军某部前线指挥员，对记者评述我军十六日歼敌九十三军暂二十二师及暂五十师一部之战斗经过称：这一胜利是给新上任的陈诚屁股上踢了一脚。自杜聿明滚蛋、陈诚来后，为挽救其在东北的军事危机，企图以局部主动出击，保护它东北通华北的唯一输血管北宁路，乃自九月六日从锦州到山海关，分三路向我热东辽西根据地进犯，其左路出自绥中，是东北保安队第一区部队改编的暂五十师主力第一、二两团，向梨树沟门进击，中路是暂六十师（亦系保安队改编），由兴城向新台门进犯，右路由锦州之线经红螺岘、江家屯为九十三军暂二十二师主力向新台门进击，企图以江家屯、新台门、梨树沟门三处为基点，向西推进。三路蒋匪于七日到达上述地点，九十三军暂二十二师为准备长期“扫荡”，特从锦州到锦西用火车送来大批粮食、弹药到杨仗子，各路并随带恶霸地主、流氓、花子队等匪帮，所到之处奸淫抢掠，无恶不作，我强大野战兵团一部得悉敌此一企图后，即以急行军，连夜奔驰，前往解救人民，十四日拂晓起，我军主动集中兵力猛击左路梨树沟门蒋匪，下午五时结束战斗，当予敌暂五十师两千余人予以歼灭性打击，我俘敌六百二十八名，毙伤敌四百余名，活捉了反动地主武装清剿队队长张维实。我到达杨仗子附近的迂回部队于十六日十一时先后赶到，下午二时发动总攻，三时三十分即将敌东西两面主要阵地攻占，将其整个防御体系打烂，匪军阵营立时呈现紊乱，我军乃接连向杨仗子工厂的巨大强固建筑物合击，匪军突围部队分别被我第一、第二及第三包围部队歼俘，战斗正午结束，合计此役毙伤敌一千余人，俘敌三千五百六十人，连梨树沟门战斗共歼俘敌四千六百零二人。此次战斗是我们给陈诚的第一棒，干脆而彻底的粉碎了他亲自所安排的“出击”。此次战斗中，所缴获的美国武器又可装备我军两个整团。
