Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 24th. Comprehensive news reports that the black market exchange rate for the US dollar in Shanghai has risen sharply. Although the Central Bank's base exchange rate for the US dollar remains at 42,500 Chiang currency to one US dollar, the black market exchange rate for the US dollar suddenly jumped from 48,000 to 54,000 yuan in the afternoon of the 22nd, an increase of about 13 percent in two hours. According to the Associated Press and Reuters, the reasons for the sharp decline in Chiang currency are: first, the Chiang government's financial crisis is developing, and Chiang currency is constantly expanding. Recently, there have been widespread rumors in the market that the Chiang government is about to issue new banknotes with denominations of 20,000 and 50,000 yuan; second, the foreign exchange depletion crisis continues to develop, and the supply of US dollars and US dollar drafts cannot meet the demand. The Associated Press quoted Shanghai financial circles as saying: "This surge, which plunged the money market into chaos, was long overdue." Because of this chaos, their trust in the Central Bank's use of "open" market exchange rates to curb black market exchange rates in the past month has completely disappeared. According to a Central News Agency dispatch from Guangzhou on the 23rd, the Guangzhou Hong Kong dollar market price is also like a runaway horse. The opening price on the 23rd was 8,280 Chiang currency to one Hong Kong dollar, but it soared to 9,080 yuan at noon, and even the evening market fell slightly to 8,900 yuan. Amid the plummeting Chiang currency, gasoline, kerosene, lubricating oil, fuel oil, etc. have all risen sharply in recent days.

Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 23rd. Tianjin News: Professors Fan Hong, Xiang Da, Rong Zhaozu, Yang Ren, Yang Ximeng, Cai Shuhang, Fei Qing, Yu Pingbo, and more than 30 others from Peking University jointly sent a letter to President Hu Shi, stating that their chalk-dust teaching careers have reached a desperate situation that is difficult to maintain, requesting improved treatment. The original letter lamented the miserable situation of the education sector in the Chiang area, stating: "Our monthly income cannot sustain half a month's living expenses, let alone the educational expenses of our children, and even less so the upcoming harsh winter. What kind of life is this? Unable to eat enough, with only the most basic working equipment, we are powerless and afraid that we will hardly be able to continue working."

    上海美钞再度猛涨
    蒋币市场陷于混乱
    【新华社陕北二十四日电】综合消息，上海美钞黑市猛烈上涨。中央银行美汇基准价虽仍为四万二千五百元蒋币兑一美元，美钞黑市却于二十二日午后由四万八千元突跃至五万四千元，两小时内约涨百分之十三。据美联社路透社透露：蒋币暴跌原因，一为蒋政府财政危机日益发展，蒋币不断膨胀，最近市面盛传蒋政府即将发行票面两万元与五万元的新钞；其次为外汇枯竭危机继续发展，美钞及美金汇票供不应求所致。美联社引上海金融界之言称：“这种使货币市场陷于混乱的暴涨是早该到来的”。由于这种混乱，他们于过去一月中对于中央银行以“公开”市场汇价来制止黑市汇价的信任已完全消失。另据中央社广州廿三日电称：广州港币市价亦如脱缰之马，二十三日开盘为八千二百八十元蒋币兑一港币，中午竟高涨为九千零八十元，晚市稍跌亦高达八千九百元。在蒋币暴跌声中，汽油、火油、机油、燃料油等连日均告猛涨。
    【新华社晋察冀二十三日电】津报讯：平北大教授樊弘、向达、容肇祖、杨人、杨西孟、蔡枢衡、费青、俞平伯等三十余人，联名致函校长胡适，以粉笔生涯已至难于维持之绝境，要求改善待遇，原函伸诉蒋区教育界的凄惨状况称：“我们一个月的收入不能维持半个月的生活，谈不到子女的教育费用，更谈不到应付即将到来的严冬，这是一种什么生活？吃不饱，仅有起马的工作设备，我们力不从心，恐怕也难继续工作”。
