    Military Supply Garment Factory No. 1 Workers Correct Their Stance
    Advise Families Not to Retain Feudal Remnants
    [Our Newspaper's Dispatch] During the land reform education process, worker Zhang Ruixiang (from Shangqin, Changzhi County) clarified his class stance and demanded that the masses be mobilized to thoroughly settle accounts with his family. He persuaded his mother not to retain feudal remnants. In a letter to the village cadres, he wrote: "My brother used to be a puppet Baozhang (chief of a 'bao,' a unit of ten households under the Nationalist government), extorting flour and grain from the masses and embezzling a lot. Now I stand on the revolutionary position and request the Farmers' Association director not to be lenient, but to mobilize the masses to thoroughly settle accounts with my family." In a letter to his mother, he said: "Now we have entered a new society, we must eliminate old ideas and change old mindsets. I advise mother not to be muddle-headed anymore. My brother embezzled the masses' property in the past, now we should return our houses and land to the masses, and should no longer retain feudal remnants. In the future, our family's livelihood will be solved by productive labor, and we will re-establish a revolutionary family." Following this, worker's family member Wang Gainv was greatly moved and persuaded her brother to reveal hidden possessions. In a letter, she wrote: "My sister-in-law is sheltering her maiden family's satin quilts, clothes, and bundles. I hope you persuade my sister-in-law to quickly take them out and send them back to Kangzeng Village, Lucheng (her maiden family's village) and hand them over to the masses! Don't make any more 'air raid shelters'!" After the above letters were read out at the workers' congress, everyone was further educated. Subsequently, comrades Song Zicheng, Li Zhanbiao, Cheng Anbang... automatically picked up their pens and wrote letters, sending three or five letters to the post office every day.

    劝家庭不留封建尾巴
    【本报讯】军供被服一厂，在土地改革教育过程中，工人张瑞祥同志（长治县上秦人）明确了阶级立场，要求发动群众彻底清算家庭；劝说母亲不留封建尾巴，向村干部的去信中写着：“我哥过去当伪保长，抽白面剥削群众粮、款，贪污很多，我现在站在革命立场，要求农会主任不要客气，发动群众，向我家作彻底的清算。”寄给他母亲的信中说：“现在到了新社会，铲除旧思想，改换旧脑筋，劝母亲不要再糊涂，我哥过去贪污群众的财物，现在、应该把咱家房屋地土归还群众，不应再留封建尾巴，今后咱家生活靠生产劳动解决，重新建立革命家庭”。接着工人家属王改女大受感动，劝哥揭开防空洞，信中写道：“我嫂包庇她娘家缎子被面、衣裳、包袱，希望你劝我嫂赶快拿出来送回潞城康增村（她娘家村）交给群众吧！千万不要再作‘防空洞’啦！”以上信件在职工大会上宣读之后，进一步的教育了大家，随后宋子成、李占标、成安邦………同志自动提笔在写信，每日三封五封不断的送进邮局。
