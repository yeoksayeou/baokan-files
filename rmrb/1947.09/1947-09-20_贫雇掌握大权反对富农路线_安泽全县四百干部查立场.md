　　The following was transmitted from Taiyue on the 18th of this month by this newspaper: Anze County conducted a thorough investigation into the poor and hired peasant line of 400 cadres and activists throughout the county. At the conference on August 22, a comprehensive examination of stance and ideology was launched, revealing that the land reform movement in many villages had followed the rich peasant line. For example, cadres in Duogou Village confessed: "The poor and hired peasants of Duogou have not yet received their fruits. Some poor peasants still rely on selling firewood for a living, and some even go hungry. The fruits of struggle over the past few years are still there, untouched. This is because our footing has not been on the side of the poor and hired peasants." Shiqu Village confessed: "In the past, we feared that the poor and hired peasants would make high demands, and we were unwilling to give fruits to those who herded cattle, fearing that if they got the fruits, no one would herd cattle for us anymore. Today, we realize that this is forgetting our roots and following the rich peasant line." Wang Qingyuan from the Sixth District confessed: "In the past, we were afraid that the poor and hired peasants would criticize us cadres at meetings, and we were also afraid that they would rise up, beat the landlords to death, and cause trouble." Cadres from Sangqu Village said: "In the past, we did not mobilize the poor and hired peasants, but ordered them to rise up. If they didn't, we would scold them. How could this mobilize the poor and hired peasants?" An activist from Wenzhou Village more frankly admitted his mistake, saying: "I told a hired worker to go to a meeting, and when he didn't go, I assigned him to a long and arduous task. This is the wrong stance." Comrades from the Sixth District confessed: "In the past, we simply regarded the mass line as the minority obeying the majority, so we all acted according to the opinions of the middle peasants. Today, we realize that without the poor and hired peasants, we cannot eliminate feudalism." Subsequently, all the cadres and activists in the Seventh District proposed: "When we go back, we must ensure that the poor and hired peasants are well-fed and clothed, and hand over the power to them." After four days of self-criticism and discussion, a fierce ideological struggle against the rich peasant line was launched. Everyone unanimously and firmly stated: We must stand on the side of the poor and hired peasants, serve the poor and hired peasants, uphold the interests of the poor and hired peasants in everything, meet the demands of the poor and hired peasants, and cultivate poor and hired peasant backbones to seize power.

　　贫雇掌握大权反对富农路线
  　安泽全县四百干部查立场
    【本报太岳十八日电】安泽全县四百干部与积极分子检查雇贫农路线。八月二十二日的大会上，展开了立场与思想大检查，发现不少村庄土改运动走了富农路线。如多沟村干部检讨说：“多沟的贫雇至今仍未分得果实。有几个贫农至今仍以卖柴为生，有的甚至饿着肚子；几年来斗争的果实都还在那里放着，这都是我们的脚跟没有站在贫雇的立场上。”石渠村检讨说：“过去思想上存在着怕贫雇要求高，不愿给放牛的分果实，惟恐他们得了果实就没有人给放牛了。今天才觉悟这是忘了本的富农路线。”六区王清元检讨说：“过去咱就怕贫雇开会提咱干部的意见，还怕他们起来打死地主，闯下乱子。”桑曲村干部说：“过去咱就不是发动贫雇，而是命令他们起来，如不起来，就骂一顿。这怎样能将贫雇发动起来？”文州村一个积极分子更坦白的承认错误说：“我叫一个雇工去开会，他不去，我就派他去支长差，这是立场不对。”六区同志检讨道：“过去将群众路线单纯认成了少数服从多数，因此皆按中农意见行事。今天才认识到没有贫雇，就不能消灭封建。”接着七区全体干部与积极分子提出：“我们回去要使贫雇农吃饱穿暖，将大权交给他们。”经过四天的检讨与讨论，于是展开了激烈的反富农路线的思想斗争。大家一致坚决表示：脚跟要站在贫雇立场上，为贫雇服务，处处拥护贫雇利益，满足贫雇要求，培养贫雇骨干掌握大权。
