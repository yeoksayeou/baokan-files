　　Linshan Drama Troupe Achieves Significant Results in Merit Campaign
　　Sun Keming
　　This spring, while performing in Taihang, the Linshan Drama Troupe of Tunliu, Taiyue, saw that merit campaigns were being enthusiastically carried out everywhere they went. They immediately focused on studying and discussing this, and decided to launch this movement within the troupe, starting with praising and pursuing past merits. Beginning in Xipo, Lucheng, in early May, they simultaneously toured and performed while carrying out the praising and pursuing of merits. This lasted about half a month. During these two weeks, everyone talked about the merits they had achieved in the troupe. Based on the length of their work and the size of their contributions, merits were evaluated separately. Comrades with great merits stated that they would work even harder in the future, not be complacent, and add merit upon merit. Comrades with small merits stated: they are not afraid of not having merits now, but they are afraid of not working hard in the future. In the process of pursuing and evaluating merits, Comrade Chen Lizhu's contributions were the greatest, and the entire troupe recorded a major merit for him. At the end of May, after the troupe returned to the county, they reported on their work to the leadership, and based on the instructions from the leadership, they deeply discussed "For whom do we establish merits, and how do we establish merits?" They also set a one-month merit-making plan for initial experimentation. Significant results have been achieved from June 6th to July 1st. First of all, in terms of business, the second half of "Officials Force the People to Revolt" and small plays such as "Steaming Dry Food," "Miscalculating the Abacus," "Failure to Quarrel," and "Production Mass Enlistment" were staged. Economically, the troupe established its own household, farming sixty-seven mu of land, laying the foundation for a home. In supporting the front line, they helped military families hoe 137 mu of land, carried 79 loads of water, wrote 7 letters, comforted the front line with 38 books, and donated 15,000 yuan. Many model figures have emerged in the merit campaign. They went from having no merit to having merit, from being not proactive to being proactive, and from not studying to studying. After everyone's evaluation, Zhang Guizhi was awarded a major merit for learning, Qiao Tianbao was awarded a major merit for labor, Li Yucheng was awarded a major merit for troupe affairs and mass relations, and Li Shangyuan was awarded a major merit for enduring hardship; in addition, Guo Baosong (a famous old artist from Shangdang) had always had ideological problems in the past, showing off his seniority and not working or studying, and he was also awarded a merit this time. Generally speaking, everyone in the troupe has contributed. Through this merit campaign, the work of the entire troupe and the political ideology of the comrades have been improved. Because of the troupe's past, especially this month's, achievements in business, ideological transformation, and mass viewpoint, the county government specially awarded the Linshan Drama Troupe a major merit.

　　麟山剧团立功运动获得显著成绩
    孙克明
    太岳屯留麟山剧团，今春在太行演出时，看到所经各地都已热烈开展了立功运动，便立即抓着研究讨论，决定在剧团内也展开这一运动，首先从表功追功做起。自五月初在潞城西坡开始，一面巡回演出，一面进行表功追功。时间约半个月。在这半月内，大家都谈了各人在剧团中立过的功劳，根据工作时间的长短和功劳的大小，分别评功。功大的同志，表示今后更加努力，不骄傲自满，功上加功；功小的同志提出：不怕现在没有功，但怕今后不努力。在追功评功过程中，以陈立柱同志功劳最大，全团给他记了一大功。五月底剧团回县后，向领导上汇报了工作情况，又根据领导上的指示，深入讨论了“为谁立功，怎样立功”？并订出一个月的立功计划，先行试验。自六月六号起至“七一”止，已获显著成绩。首先在业务上，排出了“官逼民反”后半本，及“蒸干粮”“错打算盘”“闹不成”“生产大参军”等小剧。在经济上建立了剧团家务，种地六十七亩，打下安家基础。在支援前线上，帮助军属锄地一百三十七亩，担水七十九担，写信七件，慰劳前线书三十八本，献金一万五千元。并在立功运动中涌现出很多模范人物，他们从无功到有功，从不积极到积极，从不学习到学习。经大家评选，在学习上张贵枝记大功一次，在劳动上乔天保记大功一次，在剧务和群众关系上李育昌记大功一次，在吃苦耐劳上李上元记大功一次；其余，如郭保松（上党有名的旧艺人），过去一向思想不通，摆老资格，不劳动；不学习，这次也记了功。全团一般地说每人都有功。经过这次立功运动，全团工作及同志们的政治思想都提高了一步。县政府因为剧团过去特别是这一月来，在业务上，思想改造和群众观点上的成绩，特给麟山剧团记大功一次。
