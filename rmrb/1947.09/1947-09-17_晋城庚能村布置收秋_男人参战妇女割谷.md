　　Taiyue (This newspaper) Dispatch, 15th: Jincheng Gengneng Village is preparing for the ripening of millet and sorghum. With a large number of male laborers supporting the front lines, it is necessary to organize women and other semi-able-bodied people to engage in the autumn harvest and planting. Branch Secretary Sun Qunsuo discussed this with Women's Federation Chairman Zhou Youfang. On the 15th, a village-wide women's meeting was convened to discuss the matter. Wang Lanxiang said, "Men are at war, women will shoulder the burden." Zhao Zimi's group proposed: "Our group will completely harvest our own grain, not letting the men harvest a single stalk." Consequently, many enthusiastic solutions were discussed: (1) All 73 able-bodied women and 60 semi-able-bodied women in the village will be fully organized to rush the autumn harvest; (2) Two semi-able-bodied people will be left in each courtyard to be responsible for cooking and taking care of children; (3) Each group will completely harvest its own grain, not letting the men harvest a single stalk; (4) Each group will select one person to evaluate merit and record contributions, in preparation for electing heroes after the autumn harvest; (5) After harvesting the grain, all able-bodied people in each group will immediately move to work in fields in Pancha, Dang Shengkou, Da Geta and other places, while semi-able-bodied people will switch to cutting grain, threshing, and bundling grain stalks; (6) Those who can carry manure will carry manure and deliver it. On the 7th, Sun Qunsuo convened all mutual aid team members to discuss the expansion of wheat fields and other issues, and decided: (1) To plant 400 mu more wheat this year (last year it was 800 mu); (2) To ensure 30 loads of manure and 20 carts of animal manure are applied per mu; (3) To ensure good record-keeping and promotion, and that contributions are recorded and commended. The entire village has now been mobilized, busy sharpening sickles, compacting threshing floors, and preparing all autumn harvest and planting tools.
    Taiyue (This newspaper) Dispatch, 15th: Fushan female labor hero Zhao Meiying taught more than a hundred women how to plow and plant. Female labor hero Zhao Meiying, using the old hero Shi Zhenming's plowing and planting formula: "When plowing, look at the coulter; when harrowing, look at the ox's head; when sowing seeds, use a seeder with eight holes; if the swing is too large, the seeds won't come out; if the swing is too small, all the seeds will come out," taught the women of various villages how to plow and plant. On the second day of a certain month, she taught Guan Xiuying how to plow in Fan Village's Qiliman Gully. At first, Xiuying plowed crookedly, as if she was spreading maggots. Zhao Meiying followed and plowed two passes, personally correcting her, and also taught her "lai lai dada" (commands to direct livestock). At this time, passersby on the mountain road saw this and laughed, saying, "With this, Chiang Kai-shek will be plowed away." Xiuying was also very happy to hear this. Zhao Meiying taught 32 women in Fan Village how to plow in this way. These 32 people then taught 61 others, and now a total of 93 women have learned how to plow, and have plowed 1,510 mu of wheat fields. On the 2nd of this month, at the county's wartime production commendation conference, the women of Fan Village received awards, and their energy was even greater. They pledged to return to the village and teach another 60 women how to plow. Under the promotion and cultivation of Zhao Meiying, another eight women in Guan Xiuying's brigade learned how to plow. Eight women in villages such as Shicheng, Yangcunhe, and Pangjiahang have also learned how to plow. The women also said, "Learning to work in the fields means we don't have to rely on men."

　　晋城庚能村布置收秋
  　男人参战妇女割谷
    【本报太岳十五日电】晋城庚能村谷子、高粱将要成熟，但在大批男全劳力支援前线之下，必须组织妇女与其他半劳力投入秋收秋种。支部书记孙群锁，便与妇联主席周友芳研究。十五日，召集全村妇女大会讨论，王兰香说：“男人参战去，女人来负担。”赵子密小组就提出来：“咱们小组的谷子，完全自己割，不让男人割一根。”于是，热烈的讨论出许多办法：（一）所有全村妇女全劳力七十三人，半劳力六十人，完全组织起来突击收秋；（二）每院留两个半劳力，担负作饭、看小孩等工作；（三）各组的谷子，完全自己割，不让男人割一根；（四）各组选一人评功、记功，准备秋后选举英雄；（五）割完谷子，各组全劳力立即转到盘槎、挡牲口、打圪塔等地里活，半劳力转入切谷、打场、捆谷草；（六）能担粪的担粪送粪。七日孙群锁，又召集了全体互助组组员讨论了扩大麦地等等问题，决定了：（一）今年多种麦子四百亩（去年为八百亩）；（二）保证每亩上粪三十担，畜粪二十车；（三）作到记好传好，有功就记就表扬。现全村已全部动员起来，忙着磨镰、压场，准备一切秋收、秋种工具。
    【本报太岳十五日电】浮山女劳动英雄赵美英，教会一百多个妇女犁地下种。女劳动英雄赵美英，以老英雄石振明的犁地下种口诀：“犁地看托头，耙地看牛头，降籽八只眼的猴；大摆小不摆，籽儿不出来。小摆大不摆，籽儿都出来。”教会了各村妇女犁地下种。×月二日她在范村七里漫沟教关秀英犁地，起初秀英歪歪扭扭的耩，好似窜蛆，赵美英跟着犁了两遍，亲自给她改正，并且教会她“来来达达”（指挥牲口的口号），这时山坡大路上的行人见了，哈哈大笑说：“这一下，可把蒋介石犁掉了。”秀英听了也很高兴，赵美英就这样教会了范村三十二个妇女犁地，这三十二个人又教会了六十一个，现共有九十三个妇女学会了犁地。犁出麦地一千五百一十亩。本月二日，县战勤生产功臣大会上，范村妇女得到奖励，劲儿更大了。她们保证回村再教会六十个妇女犁地，在赵美英的推动培养下，关秀英大队又有八个妇女学会犁地。史城、杨村河、庞家行等村，也有八个妇女学会犁地。妇女还说：“学会地里活，不靠男人做。”
