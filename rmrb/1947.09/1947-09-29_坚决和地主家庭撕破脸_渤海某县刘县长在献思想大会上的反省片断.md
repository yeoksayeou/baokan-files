Editor's Note: This article is excerpted from the Bohai Daily. Comrade Liu's family was originally a large landlord with four to five hundred mu of land and engaged in business. Later, they declined, but still lived a landlord's life. After being struggled against, Comrade Liu was initially quite dissatisfied, resenting the villagers and cadres for not taking care of him. Later, he made a reflection at the county party committee meeting and, with the help of comrades, he finally came to understand. The following is his understanding and reflection on the landlord family.

After the repeated help of comrades, I have gained a preliminary understanding. What issues have I thought through? First of all, the issue of whether or not it was right to struggle against me. My family is a landlord, and a major air-raid shelter for landlords. Especially when tracing back to its roots, its sins are numerous and cannot be revealed. How could this not be struggled against? The second is the issue of family affection. My own weakness is that I am sentimental. But I thought about it again. When I was about the same age as my sisters when I was a child, my mother pampered me. When I fought with my sisters, regardless of whether I was right or wrong, she would always beat my sisters. When I returned home for the second time after the War of Resistance, I was very enthusiastic, but the family had changed. My mother said, "You rarely come home, and when you do, you bring bad luck!" My wife said, "Go wash up quickly, you look like a stray dog!" I felt cold, but I thought they had suffered some grievances at home, so I would bear with a few harsh words. What stimulated me the most was that when I was sick at my aunt's house that year, my wife also fell ill when she went to see me. My mother came to see me and brought fifty yuan of puppet money. I said, "What can you do with fifty yuan? When my sister was sick, she sold all the grain for the year to treat her!" My mother said, "I didn't ask you for money, are you asking me for money?" I felt that the mother-son relationship was nothing more than that! She doesn't care if you die when she thinks you are useless. Conversely, my mother was good to my sisters again. When my sisters got married, she sold eleven mu of land. My sister's family is a puppet township chief and has businesses in Qingdao. My mother often said, "Are we counting on you? We would have died long ago if we were counting on you! We are counting on your sister!" But after Li Lianxiang was beaten, the family suddenly turned nice to me. My sister's family was completely cleaned out in the struggle, and she came to me when I happened to be home. My mother scolded my sister and said, "Are we counting on you? We are counting on your brother." I was furious at the time, thinking that the mother-son relationship was nothing more than that!

The relationship between husband and wife is the same. My wife always said to me, "Poor Eighth Route Army, Poor Eighth Route Army, how many devils have you killed?" When there was a struggle, she would say, "Today you struggle against this person, tomorrow you struggle against that person, saying that Li Lianxiang is not good, are you any better?" When her family was struggled against, she would say, "That matter with my family, won't you write a letter? What's the use of having you as a son-in-law?"

Speaking of the father-son relationship, my child is only four years old and calls me "Black Dad." I said, "Why do you call me Black Dad?" The child said, "You don't buy me flowered pants and jackets!" Therefore, I realized that this feudal society is very dirty. If you don't tear off the mask, people will tear it off long ago! Who has affection for whom is just thinking of using them. There is no such thing as affection, except for the genuine affection in the revolutionary camp. It's all nonsense. From here, I suddenly realized what the affection in a feudal family is! Today, if they need you, it's affection and love. Tomorrow, if they don't need you, you can die! My mother used to say, "I don't care if you die, who told you to get sick!" What is she doing today? She rides her little donkey and says everywhere, "I am the mother of ××!"

After I thought it through, I wrote a letter to the peasant association in my village, expressing my attitude, resolutely supporting the peasants in turning over, and severing relations with my family. Comrade Zheng Wen returned from home and said that my mother often went to the county and district to bail people out based on her status as a family member of a soldier. She even went to bail out a traitor who had tried to kill me. The district all said, "The air-raid shelter in the Shi Jie family is extremely large!" When I heard this, I was even more furious. I wrote a letter to my mother, which said, "You are a landlord, you are a sinner, and now you are sheltering landlords and traitors, adding sin upon sin, relying on the influence of a soldier's family, selling out the interests of the masses, and selling out most of my glorious history of the past few years. Therefore, I solemnly declare that I will forever sever my mother-son relationship with you. From now on, if you promote that I am your son again, that is a great insult to me, and I will sue you according to the law..."

Today, in front of the Party and all comrades, I regard this letter as my oath. From now on, I will resolutely break with the feudal family! To support the peasant's struggle for emancipation!

### 坚决和地主家庭撕破脸——渤海某县刘县长在献思想大会上的反省片断

    坚决和地主家庭撕破脸
    ——渤海某县刘县长在献思想大会上的反省片断
    编者按：这篇文章是从渤海日报摘录的，刘同志家庭原是四五百亩地的大地主，并有买卖，后来衰落了，但仍过地主生活。被斗后，刘同志起初颇为不满，懑怨村群众及干部不照顾，后来在县委会上作了反省，得到同志们帮助，算是想开了，下面是他对地主家庭的认识和反省。
    经过同志们再三帮助，我算初步觉悟了。我想开了些什么问题呢？首先是该斗不该斗的问题，我家是个地主，又是地主的大防空洞，特别叙起根子来，罪恶累累，更不能见人，这个怎么不该斗呢？再一个是家庭感情问题，我本身弱点重感情，可是我又想了想，我小时和我姊妹差不多大，母亲对我娇生惯养，和姊妹打仗，不管有理无理，照例是打我姊妹一顿。我抗战后第二年回家一趟，本来热情很高，可是家庭变了，母亲说：“你轻易不来家，家来净丧闷俺！”老婆说：“你上坑赶紧洗洗，你看浑身象野狗味一样！”自己感到冷酷了，但还想他们在家受了些冤屈，熊两句就熊两句吧。对我刺激最厉害的是那年我病在姑母家，老婆去看我也病倒了。母亲来看我，拿了五十元伪钞去，我说：“你拿五十元钱来够作什么呢？我妹妹生病时把全年粮食都卖了，给她治病！”母亲说：“我没和你要钱，你还和我要钱吗？”我当时觉得母子关系不过如此！她觉得你没用处时，你死她也不管。反过来我母亲对我姊妹又好了，姊妹出嫁，卖了十一亩地；姊妹家是个伪乡长，在青岛还有买卖，母亲常说：“俺指着你吗？俺指着你早死了！俺是指着你妹妹呀！”但自打了李连祥后，家庭突然对我转好了，我妹妹家斗了个净光，这时她家来我也正回家；我母亲把妹妹骂了一顿，又说：“俺指着你吗？俺是指着你哥哥。”我当时火了，心里想，母子感情不过如此！
    夫妇关系也是一样，我老婆见了我老是说：“穷八路，穷八路，打了几个鬼子？”一闹斗争她又说：“今天斗这个明天斗那个，说人家李连祥不好，你好，你好！”她娘家被斗就说：“俺娘家那事，你不写个信吗？要你这女婿有啥用？”
    再说父子关系，我小孩才四岁，叫我“黑爹”，我说：“你为什么叫我黑爹呢？”小孩说：“你不给我买花裤花袄！”因此，我想到这个封建社会肮脏的很，你撕不破脸皮，人家早撕破脸皮啦！谁和谁有感情，就是想利用谁，无所谓什么感情；除非革命阵营有真正的感情外，那都是胡说。从这里我恍然大悟，认识了封建家庭的感情是什么东西！今天用着你就是情、就是爱，明天用不着你，你死了也活该！我母亲过去说：“你死了也不管，谁叫你病来！”今天怎样呢？她骑着小毛驴，到处说：“我是××的娘啊！”
    我想开后，给俺庄农会写了一封信，表明态度，坚决支持农民翻身，和家庭断绝关系。郑文同志从家回来，他说我母亲常以军属地位到县区去保人，一个曾企图杀害我的汉奸，她也去保他，区里全说：“世杰家里那个防空洞可大极了！”我一听更火了，我给我母亲写了一封信，上头说：“你是地主，你是罪人，现在又掩护地主汉奸，罪上加罪，依仗抗属势力，出卖群众利益，并将我几年光荣历史出卖大部，因此，我郑重声明，永远与你脱离母子关系，从今后如果你再宣扬我是你儿子，那是对我莫大污辱，我将依法起诉……”
    今天在党和全体同志面前，把这封信，当作我的誓词，从今后，坚决和封建家庭撕破脸。为农民的翻身斗争撑腰！
