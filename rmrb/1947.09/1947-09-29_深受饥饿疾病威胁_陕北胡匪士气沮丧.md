Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 26th: After the Chaikou battle, this reporter patrolled the battlefield. In the mountainous areas northeast of Yan'an, which had been occupied by the bandit troops, the eye could see rectangular exposed pits. Each squad had one, with a circular fortification built at the four missing corners. Inside the enclosure was spread wheat straw, and everywhere were raw corn cobs and pumpkins. Piles of excrement and urine made the place dirty and foul-smelling. The bandits curled up in these pigpens every night, enduring the cold autumn nights of the Northwest plateau. This year, northern Shaanxi suffered from summer drought and autumn flooding. The bandits, exposed to the elements, endured wind and rain, and many suffered from dysentery and malaria. According to prisoners, this time the large forces were trapped, and when they encountered rain and rising water, they were in a terrible state. Two days before the Chaikou battle, on September 12, when the 12th Brigade of the 17th Division was encamped on both sides of the Xiuyan River, 30 miles south of Qingjian, a sudden wind and rainstorm occurred in the middle of the night, and a mountain torrent surged down. When the soldiers woke up from their exhausted sleep, more than 30 people and more than 100 mules and horses from the 35th and 36th Regiments had been washed away, and even the light and heavy mortars on the pack animals were washed away by the flood. However, on the 14th, the People's Liberation Army launched a swift and courageous general offensive, scattering the dense bandit troops and causing them to flee in panic. On the second day of the Chaikou battle, at dawn, when the People's Liberation Army was cleaning up the battlefield, they found a machine gun thrown at the entrance of a cave, and someone inside the cave shouted for help. The People's Liberation Army soldiers used five long ropes to pull the people up. It turned out to be Hu Wenzhou, the squad leader of the 6th Squad of the Machine Gun Company of the 35th Regiment of the 12th Brigade of the bandit army, and Private Li Jichang. According to them, "They were squeezed and fell in the dark and ran away in a hurry, the cave was five zhang deep, and they were unconscious at the time." In this terrifying and embarrassing escape, the morale of the Hu army was extremely low. The reporter obtained half a page of a family letter from the corpse of a soldier of the 55th Brigade of the 38th Division of the Hu army, which read: "The trip to northern Shaanxi is the first time in my life of more than 20 years that I have tasted the hardships of life." Therefore, he said that he had "seen through the mortal world" and vowed to desert and "return south" home.

Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 27th: The Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops, who have been left far behind by the Northwest People's Liberation Army and are at a loss for what to do, are deeply threatened by hunger and disease and their morale is extremely low. According to the Chiang Kai-shek army prisoner Wang Youjin, "The Suide Military Hospital has recently starved to death more than 200 wounded soldiers. Earlier this month, more than 400 wounded soldiers, who had not eaten a grain of rice for three days, staggered and cried in the hospital and on the streets." From August 28 to September 6, the 3rd Company of the 1st Battalion of the 72nd Regiment of the 24th Brigade of the 76th Division had starved to death or died of illness 11 people, and 16 people had deserted, leaving only 50 or 60 people in the company, a reduction of 27 people in ten days. In addition, the People's Liberation Army recently seized a batch of letters, in which Tang Junzhuang, an officer of the 90th Division Transportation Regiment, said in a letter to his friend: "For more than ten days, we have been eating millet and pumpkins, and sometimes we can't eat anything at all. Especially recently, all the food has been delivered by plane, but the flatbreads that are dropped are moldy and smelly and cannot be eaten. If I am lucky enough to get out of the mountains, I will resolutely ask for leave and not do it." The political workers of the 1st Division even cried in their letters to their relatives and friends: "Trapped far away in northern Shaanxi, the danger is extraordinary. I am looking for another way to survive."

    深受饥饿疾病威胁
    陕北胡匪士气沮丧
    【新华社西北二十六日电】岔口战斗后，记者巡行战场，在延安东北六十公里地区胡匪侵占过的山野里，触目皆是一块块长方形的露出坑。每班一块，四缺口处筑着一个圆形工事，围墙里面铺着麦秸，到处是生玉米棒子和南瓜。屎尿成堆，脏臭难闻。胡匪每夜就蜷缩在这种猪圈里，度过西北高原寒冷的秋夜。今年陕北夏旱秋涝，胡匪露宿旷野饱尝风雨，患痢疾和患虐疾的特别多。据俘虏供称，这次大部队陷入重围，又碰上阴雨涨水，狼狈不堪。岔口战斗前两天，即九月十二日，十七师十二旅在清涧南三十里铺秀延河两岸露宿时，夜半突然狂风暴雨大作，山洪汹涌而来，士兵们从疲惫的睡梦中惊醒时，三十五及三十六两个团已被冲走三十多人和一百多头骡马，连驮子上的轻重迫击炮也被大水推走了。解放军却在十四日以神速勇猛之势开始总攻，打得密集的胡匪抱头鼠窜，乱成一堆，谁也找不到谁。在岔口战斗第二天拂晓，当解放军打扫战场时，发现一个洞口丢着一挺机枪，洞内有人呼喊救命。解放军战士用五条长绳才把人吊上来，原来是胡匪十二旅三十五团机枪连六班班长胡文周和一等兵李继昌。据他俩说：“是在黑夜仓惶逃跑中被挤跌进去的，洞深五丈，当时都昏迷过去了。”在这种恐怖狼狈的败逃中，胡军士气极度沮丧。记者获得胡军三十八师五十五旅一个士兵尸体上半页家信，上面写着：“陕北之行实一生二十余年来首次尝尽人生之苦辛”。因此他说已“看破红尘”，发誓要开小差“南返”回家了。
    【新华社西北二十七日电】被西北人民解放军远远抛在后面进退失据的蒋胡匪军，深受饥饿，疾病死亡的威胁，士气极为沮丧。据俘虏蒋军王有金说：“绥德伤兵医院最近已饿死伤兵二百多人，本月初另有四百多伤兵因三天未进粒米，都跄地在院内和街上哭闹不休。”七十六师廿四旅七十二团第一营第三连从上月二十八日至本月六日，已饿死病死十一人，逃跑十六人，仅剩下五六十人的一个连，十天内即减员二十七人。另解放军近缴获信件一批，其中九十师运输团军官唐俊壮在致其友人的信中说：“十余日来吃的是小米南瓜，有时甚至什么都吃不到，特别是最近粮食全靠飞机投送，但投下的大饼都霉臭得不能吃。弟如幸能出山，便坚决请假不干。”第一师的政工人员更在信中向其亲友哭诉：“远困陕北，危险异常，正图他途，以求活命。”
