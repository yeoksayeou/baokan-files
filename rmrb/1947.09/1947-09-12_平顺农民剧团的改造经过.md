　　The Transformation of the Pingshun Peasant Drama Troupe
　　Li Zhuomin
    Editor's note: The Pingshun Peasant Drama Troupe was commended at the Taihang Third District Commissioner's Office Drama Troupe Conference on July 9th, mainly because the troupe's recent activities have been quite adapted to the rural environment, carrying out drama propaganda deep in the mountain villages. Although this article's introduction to the troupe's experience is not comprehensive, it can still be used as a reference for various regions.
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
　　Although the peasant drama troupe paid attention to the creation and rehearsal of new dramas from the very beginning of its establishment in July 1945, because most of the actors were from old performers, they always felt that performing old dramas was their forte, so the performance of old dramas often outnumbered new dramas. For the performance of old dramas, there were "a large pile of costumes and props," and some old-fashioned people with backward thinking didn't want to carry their bedding, so at least four or five livestock had to be used for each trip, which added a burden to the drama performing village. In addition, there was also the idea of making money at that time, so a single performance cost tens of thousands (referring to last winter); and individual actors were arrogant and had a bad work style, refusing to go on stage without eating white flour for lunch...

　　However, the drama troupe mainly operated in rural areas, and Pingshun is a county with many mountains and valleys, with scattered villages more numerous than concentrated villages, small villages more numerous than large villages, and mountain villages more numerous than flat villages; how could such a large and pompous drama troupe meet the needs of the county's masses? Livestock carrying the boxes could not walk the small roads on the eastern mountains, so scattered villages could not see the performances, and small villages could not afford such a large performance price and could not see them either. Although large villages could barely see one or two performances a year, the number of large villages was too small. As a result, the drama troupe spent more than half a year at home, the actors felt very depressed, and their lives were difficult, and they didn't know whether they were considered separated from production or not; and some villages provided the actors with millet as war service labor, but because the actual division of labor was small, even the millet for war service labor was not enough, and the actors' enthusiasm was even smaller. The masses were naturally dissatisfied due to the above reasons. The leadership also felt that the drama troupe faced numerous difficulties and was not easy to solve for a while. General cadres also considered the drama troupe a burden. Thus, the objective situation told us that if we didn't transform quickly, it would be difficult to continue.

　　At this time, the leadership proposed: "Be determined to transform and change to a small drama troupe, with a maximum of no more than thirty people, and everyone must learn to perform dramas and play music, perform more small dramas and fewer large dramas."

　　At first, the actors' thinking was not clear. First, they felt that shrinking from large to small was a disappointing thing. Second, they felt that it seemed that completely abolishing old dramas at the moment could not fully meet the tastes of the masses. Third, they felt that not writing the performance price would make life very difficult; in particular, they felt that not performing large dramas was too stingy and not enjoyable enough. So there was a lot of discussion. But on the other hand, everyone also knew that it wouldn't work if they didn't transform. When performing in Xincheng and other places, the masses in the Sixth District reflected: "The peasant drama troupe can never be seen on the eastern mountains, it's better to simply cancel it!" All kinds of situations fully illustrate the masses' dissatisfaction with the drama troupe. Under this trend, there was only trial transformation.

　　So in early June, the applicable actors were flexibly concentrated, and small dramas such as "Persuading to Return to the Team," "Way Out," "Wrong Calculation," and "Persuading the Woman to Be Satisfied" were rehearsed. After the "July 1st" meeting, they took the government's letter of introduction and went to the countryside with their luggage and curtains, combining with drought resistance and famine preparation to carry out free publicity.

　　During this tour, the drama troupe only asked the masses to provide meals (the actors ate whatever the masses ate) and did not ask for performance prices. They performed dramas at night and helped the masses in the fields during the day. And in four or five days, they performed in three or four villages. In addition to marching every day, literate comrades also wrote slogans and drew cartoons along the way. After arriving at the village, they combined with the village's work to perform. For example, when they arrived at Gelianpu Village, they saw that the famine was already very serious. One family was still eating noodles in the morning. According to the masses, this family usually didn't save money. The drama troupe performed "Wrong Calculation" that night, and after the curtain closed, the village cadres also spoke on stage. In addition, seeing a twenty-three-year-old girl who wanted to marry freely, but her parents didn't allow it, and at the same time seeing that some places still bound women's feet and looked at dates for engagement... and other phenomena, they performed "Xiao Erhei's Marriage," which had not been performed for many days. Furthermore, because some backward masses in Gouge Village went to the Five Dragon Cave to fetch water and pray to the gods due to the long drought, they immediately composed "Anti-Superstition" clapper talks. Doing this, they gained unexpected results.

　　First of all, the masses no longer regarded them as an old opera troupe, but treated them with the attitude of a work team. The masses in Dongqingbei said: "This is a propaganda team! We couldn't understand the dynasty emperors they used to sing about, but now they are performing real people and real things in front of us, the words are easy to understand, and the things are easy to understand. This is our own drama troupe performing our own things!" A cadre in × Village also said: "The drama troupe's performance in our village is better than our ten days of meetings, and it's a great help to us!" The actors' thinking also changed. They said: "Looking back today, it's all because our thinking was not clear in the past and our practices were wrong. If we were like today, who would still look at us as actors!"

　　Secondly, the masses on the eastern mountains had never seen the drama troupe perform. This time, the drama troupe went there themselves with their luggage and curtains. They performed in Junlaoyan, Gelianpu, and other places. The masses, even women carrying children, from twenty or thirty miles away, rushed to sit at the bottom of the stage early. When the drama started, it was either silent or unanimous cheers. After one act was finished, they shouted: "Quick, do another one!" After the break, the actors went to eat, and the masses ate dry food under the stage, so crowded that they couldn't move. The masses' enthusiastic enthusiasm for watching the drama was something the drama troupe actors had never seen before. So although everyone ate bran soup and vegetable water, and climbed mountains and ridges with their luggage on their backs, they were indescribably happy in spirit.

　　From this performance, the actors' wrong ideas such as "big drama craze," "making money," "not being able to leave old dramas now," "the masses want to see us as actors"... were broken. Now everyone feels very happy. They said: "As long as we solve the problem of food and clothing, there will be no problems. Let's quickly compile short and concise dramas!" So there is such a harvest because the drama troupe changed to short and sharp this time, facing the rural areas and going deep into the masses, going deep into the mountain villages, and at the same time immediately compiling clapper talks to carry out publicity. We think this practice proves that the above road should be the road for the future development of the Pingshun Drama Troupe.

　　Now the staff of the drama troupe has been streamlined, in principle, there are only thirty people. In the future, it will be divided into two small propaganda teams, and when necessary, they will be concentrated to perform, which will greatly enhance the drama troupe's flexibility and mobility. They also plan to feed a donkey, which can be used to carry things when they are concentrated, and can also be lent to the villagers for use after arriving in the village. When not needed, they can engage in transportation and production. They also plan to plant some land for agricultural production to enrich and establish the drama troupe's housework, etc.

　　平顺农民剧团的改造经过
    李卓民
    编者按：平顺农民剧团曾在七月九日太行三专署剧团会议上得到表扬，主要的原因是由于该团最近活动相当地适应了农村环境，深入到山庄窝铺中进行戏剧宣传。本文对于该团经验介绍虽不全面，但仍可供各地参考研究。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    农民剧团虽然自四五年七月一开始成立就注意了新剧的创作与排演，但因演员多出身于旧艺人，总觉得演旧剧拿手，所以旧剧的出演常常多于新剧。旧剧的出演，“行头箱把”一大堆，加之有些思想落后的旧把式不想背铺盖，于是出门最低限度必须用四、五头牲口，这负担便加在演剧村的身上了。再加上当时还有个赚钱的想法，所以演一台戏动辄几万（指去年冬）；而且个别演员自高自大，作风不好，不吃上顿白面就不登台………。
    但是剧团主要是活动于农村，而平顺又是个多山多沟的县，是分散村多集中村少，小村多大村少，山庄多平村少的县；以这样庞大派头的剧团如何能满足本县群众的要求呢？牲口驮上箱不能走东山上的小路，所以分散村不能看到，小村花不起那样大的戏价，也看不到。大村虽然一年中勉强能唱一两次，但大村为数就太少了。因此造成剧团一年在家住多半年，演员感到非常苦闷，而且生活又困难，也不知自己算个脱离生产，还是不脱离生产；并且有些村子给演员出战勤变工小米，但因实际分工很少，连变工小米也出不够，演员的劲头就更小了。群众因上述原因，自然不满意。领导上也觉得剧团困难重重，一时不好解决。一般干部也认为剧团是个累赘。于是客观情况告诉，再不赶快改造，将难于继续下去了。
    就在这时，领导上提出：“决心改造，改成小型剧团，人数最多不超过三十人，每人都要学会演剧又会音乐，多演小型剧少演大型剧。”
    开始提出来演员思想弄不通。第一是觉得由大缩小，是件败兴事。第二觉得当下就取消了旧剧，似乎还不能尽合群众口味。第三觉得不写戏价，生活上要大大吃苦；特别是感到不演大剧实在小气，又不过瘾。于是议论纷纷。但是另一方面，大家也深知不改造不行，象在新城等地演出时，六区群众反映：“东山上永看不到农民剧团的戏，不如干脆取消了它”！种种情况，充分说明群众对剧团的不满，在此趋势下，就只有试行改造了。
    于是在六月初，将应用的演员灵活集中，排出了“劝归队”“出路”“错打算盘”“劝妇满”…………等小型剧。在“七一”会后，拿上政府的介绍信自己背着行李幕布下乡，结合抗旱备荒进行义务宣传。
    在这次巡回演出期间，剧团只要群众管饭（群众吃啥演员吃啥），不要戏价。晚上演戏，白天帮助群众下地。并曾在四、五天内，演出三四个村子，每天除行军外，沿途识字的同志还写标语，画漫画。到了村子以后，与村上工作结合演出。如到圪联铺村，见到灾荒已经很严重，一家上午还吃面条，据群众说这家往常日就不节省。剧团黑夜便演出“错打算盘”，闭幕后村干部又登台讲了话。另外见一个二十三岁的闺女要自由结婚，家里父母不允许，同时又看到有的地方仍给妇女缠足，订婚看日子………等现象，就演出多日未演的“小二黑结婚”。再因构各村部分落后群众因天久旱不雨，到五龙洞去取水求神，便又即时编出“反迷信”等快板鼓词。以上这样一干，得到了出乎演员意外的收获。
    首先群众已不再把他们当旧戏班子看，而以对工作员的态度来对待他们了。东青北的群众说：“这是宣传队呀！过去唱的那一朝一帝咱懂不得，现在演的是眼前的真人真事，话也好懂，事也好懂，这才是咱自己的剧团演咱自己的事呢”！×村干部也说：“剧团来咱村演一次戏，比咱开十天会都强，对咱帮助可大！”演员的思想也起了变化，他们说：“今天回想起来，都是怨咱过去思想不通，作法不对，要象今天这样，谁还能当戏子看咱”！
    其次，东山上群众从来没见过剧团演戏，这次剧团自己背行李、幕布去了，在军老岩、圪联铺等地出演，附近二三十里地远的群众，甚至妇女抱着孩子早早地赶来坐满台底，一开戏，不是鸦雀无声，就是同声喝采，演完了一幕就高呼：“快，再来一个”！休息后，演员去吃饭，群众便在台底下吃干粮，挤的走不开路。这种群众热烈观剧的热情，是剧团演员从未见过的。所以虽然大家吃的是糠汤菜水，背上行李爬山越岭，但精神上却是说不完的愉快。
    从这次出演中打破了演员们的“大剧迷”“赚钱”“当下离不了旧剧”“群众要当戏子看咱”…………等错误思想。现在大家觉得非常痛快，他们说：“咱只要把吃穿问题解决了，啥问题也没有了，快编短小精干的戏吧”！所以有这样的收获，就是由于剧团这次改为短小精悍，面向农村深入群众，深入山庄窝铺，同时即时的编写快板鼓词进行宣传，我们想这次实践证明，以上这条道路应是平顺剧团今后发展的道路。
    现剧团人员精简后，原则上只有三十人，今后分为两个小型宣传队，必要时集中起来出演，这样会大大增强剧团的灵活性机动性。他们还计划喂头毛驴，一旦集中时驮东西，到村后尚可借给老乡用。用不着时，运输搞生产。并计划种些地进行农业生产，充实与建立剧团家务等等。
