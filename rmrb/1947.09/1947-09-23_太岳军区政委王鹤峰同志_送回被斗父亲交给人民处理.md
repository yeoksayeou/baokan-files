    Taiyue Military Region Political Commissar Comrade Wang Hefeng
    Sends His Accused Father Back to Be Handled by the People
    [Report from our newspaper in Jilu Yu on the 20th] Comrade Wang Hefeng, Political Commissar of the Taiyue Military Region, firmly stood his ground, sending his accused father back to be handled by the masses. Comrade Wang Hefeng is from Wang Zaolin, Kunwu Third District. His family was an old landlord family. His father, Wang Peiyong, usually oppressed and exploited the poor, and the masses had long wanted to struggle against him; however, they felt he was a military family member and did not struggle. During this review, with the support of district cadres, Wang Peiyong was struggled against, and some floating wealth was seized. He was released after obtaining personal and financial guarantees. After this, he fled to the Taiyue Military Region to hide. Comrade Hefeng, upon seeing his father, expressed a very serious attitude, advising his father to return home. After three days, on August 10th, he sent a special person to escort his father back. He also personally wrote a letter to the district cadres: "Responsible comrades of the district cadres: My father, Wang Peiyong, is an object of struggle. Now, in order to escape the struggle, he has fled to my place. In order to prevent him from slipping through the net, I have strongly persuaded him to return. I am now sending someone to escort him back to the district. You can handle his problem without any worries, according to his specific situation and the opinions of the masses. I can only firmly support and approve of the masses' just liberation actions, and I have no (nor should I have) any opposing opinions." After receiving the letter, the Third District Committee issued a special call for all district cadres to learn from Comrade Wang Hefeng's stance of safeguarding the interests of the masses, and his unwavering position.

    太岳军区政委王鹤峰同志
    送回被斗父亲交给人民处理
    【本报冀鲁豫二十日电】太岳军区政委王鹤峰同志，立场坚定，送回被斗父亲，交群众处理。王鹤峰同志昆吾三区王枣林人，家庭为老地主，父亲王培雍平日压迫剥削穷人，群众早想斗争他；但觉得他是军属，没有斗。这次复查中，在区干的撑腰下，把王培雍斗了，清算出来一部浮财，让他取了人保财保释放。此后他跑到太岳军区去隐避。鹤峰同志见他的父亲，表明很严肃的态度，劝他父亲回家。经过三天工夫，于八月十日派专人将他父亲送回。并亲笔给区干写了一封信：“区干负责同志：我父王培雍是个斗争对象，现因逃避斗争，跑至我处，为了使他不致漏网，我已大力说服他回去。今派人将他押送回区，你们可根据他的具体情况与群众意见毫不顾虑的处理他的问题。我只有坚决拥护与赞成群众的正义的翻身行动，而没有（也不应有）任何反对的意见。”三区委会收到信后，特号召全区干部学习王鹤峰同志这种维护群众利益、坚定不移的立场。
