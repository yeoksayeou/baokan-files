Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th: Moscow dispatch: Soviet industrial production achieved brilliant successes in August. The significant victory in the fuel industry, in particular, has provided the necessary conditions for various industries and transportation for the winter. Oil production in various regions has exceeded the plan. The output of newly opened oil fields in the east has increased by more than a quarter compared to August of last year, proving that new oil areas are developing rapidly. Electricity production has also increased by nearly one-fifth compared to August of last year. Workers in Leningrad initiated a socialist competition to complete this year's production plan before the 30th anniversary of the October Revolution, and workers across the country responded enthusiastically. Seven districts in Leningrad had already exceeded the previous month's plan by 40% by the end of August. Eight districts in Moscow have completed the September plan, and 112 industrial sectors have completed the annual plan for this year. Other industries completed the August plan in mid-August. The total production volume of Moscow City and Oblast in the first eight months of this year increased by 26% compared to the same period last year. Railway workers have victoriously completed the grain transportation work, which has become exceptionally difficult due to the unprecedented bumper harvest this year, and the large amount of raw materials, fuel, and equipment for winter storage for various industries has also been transported. Continuous innovation has further improved productivity. A youth work team led by Anna Kuznetsova, a female worker at a Moscow automobile factory, improved the production process using original working methods, and the work team completed the 1950 plan in mid-August. This method enables the factory to increase automobile production without adding new workers and equipment. Therefore, it has been emulated by the Stalin Automobile Factory and many other factories. Soviet Automobile Industry Minister Yatopov has issued a special commendation and called for the widespread launch of the Kuznetsova-style production movement.

  　创新方法改进生产现已完成五年计划
    【新华社陕北十四日电】莫斯科讯：苏联工业生产在八月份又获辉煌成就。尤以燃料工业的重大胜利，已为各工业及运输业提供过冬的必要条件。各地石油生产都已超过计划，东部新开油田之产量比去年八月增加四分之一强，证明新油区正飞速发展。电力生产亦较去年八月增加几及五分之一。列宁格勒工人发起在十月革命三十周年纪念日前完成今年生产计划之社会主义竞赛，全国各地工人奋起响应。列城七个区八月底已超过上月份计划百分之四十。莫斯科八个区已完成九月份计划，并有一百一十二个工业部门已完成今年全年计划。其他工业均在八月中旬完成八月份计划。莫斯科市及州今年八个月的总生产量，较去年同期增加百分之二十六。今年因空前大丰收而骤形艰巨之谷物运输工作，铁路工人已胜利完成，各工业储藏过冬的大量原料、燃料与器材也已运输完竣。不断从事新发明，已更加提高生产率。莫斯科一汽车工厂之女工安娜·库斯尼佐娃领导下的青年工作队，用独创的工作方法改进生产过程，竟使该工作队在八月中旬就完成了一九五○年的计划。此种方法能使该工厂增加汽车出产而无须增加新工人与装备，因此已被斯大林汽车工厂及许多其他工厂所仿效。苏联汽车工业部长亚托波夫已特令嘉奖，并号召广泛展开库斯尼佐娃式的生产运动。
