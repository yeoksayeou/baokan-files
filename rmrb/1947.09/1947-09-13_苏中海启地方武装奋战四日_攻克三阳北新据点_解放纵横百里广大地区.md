Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 11th: The local armed forces of the People's Liberation Army in the Su (zhou) Zhong (area of Jiangsu Province) Hai (men) Qi (dong) region of Jiang (Kai-shek)-occupied Suzhong, eliminated Chiang's and puppet troops in the area, and captured seventeen important strongholds, including Sanyang and Beixin. They killed over 120 Chiang soldiers, including a Major General Staff Officer Zhao (name to be verified) from the Chiang army's "Suppression" Headquarters. They captured alive over 733 officers and soldiers, including Chiang's Jiangsu Provincial Security 6th Column, 1st Battalion Deputy Chen Wende, and Qidong Security Battalion Commander Wu Zhongxian, seizing a large amount of supplies. The battle began on the 13th of last month, first driving out the Chiang and puppet troops from the Hai Fu Town and other strongholds that had penetrated our central area. Then, on the 15th, they moved south along the Haiqi Highway. Wherever they pointed their spears, the enemy fled in full force, and Sanyang, Beixin, Xingang, and others were quickly recovered. The Liberation Army then took advantage of the victory and marched overnight towards the ports of Chuanbin and Sanhe along the Yangtze River. The Chiang and puppet troops fled in panic into the river. We then waved our hands and removed the satellite strongholds on the periphery of Long (Longzhen, Qidong County), such as Gaojia Town and Yujia Village, compressing the Chiang and puppet troops into Maozhen (Maozhen, under the jurisdiction of Haimen County) and Huilong. There was no trace of the enemy for hundreds of miles. In an attempt to reverse the critical situation, the enemy gathered the fleeing Chiang and puppet troops and reoccupied Sanyang, Xingang, and Beixin. However, they immediately fell into our large encirclement. After four days of siege from the 20th to the 24th, all the defending enemies in these three strongholds were annihilated.
