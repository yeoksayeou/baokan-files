　　Suzhong Expands Political Offensive
　　Disintegrating Eight Hundred Chiang Bandits
　　Desertions Among Chiang Bandit Officers Increasing Daily
　　【Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 13th】Following the victory at Ye Ting City, Suzhong and surrounding areas are expanding their political offensive, accelerating the shaking and disintegration of Chiang's forces. Verified reports indicate that in the past month, over eight hundred soldiers have defected with their weapons or deserted, the majority of whom have been assisted by district and township democratic governments to return to their home villages. On August 23rd, at the Fu'an stronghold in Dongtai, nine Chiang soldiers were bathing in the river when they went to the north bank to pick melons. In the melon field, they found a leaflet that read, "The Northeast direction is the only way out with the New Fourth Army." After discussing it for a long time, they collectively ran towards the northeast. Along the way, the common people pointed them in the direction of the New Fourth Army. The remnant troops of Chiang's 49th Division, who reoccupied Sanyu Town in Nantong, saw two hundred soldiers desert in six days. Of these, one hundred and fifty were assisted by the democratic government to return home. Bao Hui, a squad leader of Chiang's army in the town, led his entire squad of eight men, carrying five rifles and over three hundred rounds of ammunition. When they saw our cadres, they immediately took out our leaflet from their pockets and read, "Chiang's army brothers are welcome to return with their weapons; two thousand catties of grain will be rewarded for dragging a machine gun, and four hundred catties for a rifle." After reading, he smiled and said, "This time, we brought five rifles, so we have travel expenses to go home!" On another occasion, seventeen Chiang soldiers in the town brought a machine gun and eleven rifles. When the communications platoon of Chiang's 237th Regiment went out to repair electric wires, the deputy squad leader pretended to borrow a bamboo pole from the common people and ran away. The platoon leader sent three soldiers to chase after him, but the deputy squad leader turned around, waved, and shouted, "Those who want to desert and go home, follow me!" The three soldiers also went with him and never returned. The wind of desertion among Chiang's army has even spread to middle and lower-ranking officers. The second battalion commander and machine gun company commander of the Xu Rong remnant troops of the independent regiment under Chiang's 83rd Division deserted together. After Hao Pengju's remnant troops were annihilated, they were even more terrified. Yang Shubin, the instructor of the machine gun and artillery company of the third battalion and eighth regiment of the third division of that unit, and three others, defected with their weapons. According to them, "Most soldiers only hope to become prisoners of war sooner rather than later."
　　【Another dispatch】A person from Nantong reported that soldiers of the 105th Brigade of Chiang's 49th Division, fearing being transferred to the Northeast, cried out when boarding a ship in Tianshenggang, "Rather die here than die in the Northeast!" and threw themselves into the river with their weapons, causing the soldiers to resonate and jump into the river to escape, numbering over a hundred. The ship was forced to return to shore.
　　【Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 13th】In the battle of the Central China Liberation Army to capture Yancheng, issues seven and eight of volume two of Chiang's Ministry of National Defense Gazette were seized, containing a partial list of the names of Chiang's military organs and units' fugitive officers from February and March of the thirty-sixth year, totaling four hundred and eighty officers below the rank of lieutenant general. Among them, only fifty-three deserted from September of the thirty-first year to July of the thirty-fifth year, before Chiang Kai-shek launched the full-scale civil war, averaging one per month. From July of the thirty-fifth year to February of the thirty-sixth year, three hundred and eighty-three deserted during the civil war, averaging forty-eight per month, which is more than forty-one times the average monthly desertion rate before the civil war. The time of desertion of the remaining forty-four is unclear. Among the fugitive officers were Wang Yi, the lieutenant general garrison commander of a certain place, Zeng Guanghan, the major general director of the military headquarters, and Jiang Guangqi, the major general inspector of the former Third War Zone, covering three hundred and ninety units, mostly Chiang Kai-shek's direct line troops. The reasons for the desertions were mostly "lack of firm will," "desertion in the face of battle," "fear of combat," and "abandonment of duty and absconding." The locations of desertion were mostly on the front lines of the civil war.

  　瓦解蒋匪八百
  　蒋匪军官逃亡日增
    【新华社华中十三日电】叶挺城大捷后，苏中各地扩展政治攻势，加速蒋内动摇瓦解，据查实者近月来携械来归与逃散者已达八百余名，大部经区乡民主政府资助回籍。八月廿三日东台富安据点有九个蒋军在河里洗澡时上北岸摘瓜吃，在瓜田里拾到“往东北方向是新四军才是出路”的传单，他们商量了半晌后就集体向东北跑，沿路老百姓都指点他们往新四军去的道路。重占南通三余镇之蒋四九师残部，六天中即逃亡二百余名，其中经民主政府资助回乡者一百五十余名，该镇蒋军班长鲍辉率全班八人，携枪五支，子弹三百余发，见到我干部时即在袋里拿出我之传单念道：“欢迎蒋军兄弟携械来归，拖机枪一挺赏粮二千斤，步枪一支四百斤。”念后他笑着说：“这次拖来五支步枪，回家盘缠有啦！”另一次该镇蒋杂十七人携来机枪一挺，步枪十一支。蒋二三七团通讯排出动修理电线，二班长借到老百姓家找竹杆为名，拔腿逃亡，排长叫三个士兵去追，那班长回头招手高喊：“愿开小差回家的跟我来。”三个士兵也就跟着一去不返了。蒋军逃风甚至已漫延至中下级军官，蒋八十三师所部独立团徐容残部二营长和机枪连长即联袂逃亡。郝逆鹏举残部于其一师被歼后，更惶惶不可终日，该部三师八团三营机炮连指导员杨树彬等四人携械来归，据谈：“大多数士兵只希望早些当俘虏。”
    【又电】据南通来人谈称：蒋四九师一零五旅士兵因怕调往东北，在天生港乘轮起航时，一士兵流泪大呼“死到东北去不如死在这里，”带枪投江，引起士兵共鸣，相率跳江逃亡者达百数十名。航船被迫回驶靠岸。
    【新华社华中十三日电】华中解放军攻克盐城之役，缴获蒋记国防部公报第二卷第七、八两期，内载三十六年二、三两月份通缉蒋记各军事机关部队逃亡官佐姓名清册一部分，计有中将以下四百八十名。其中三十一年九月至三十五年七月蒋贼发动全面内战以前，逃亡者仅五十三名。平均每月一名；三十五年七月至三十六年二月，内战中逃亡者达三百八十三名，平均每月四十八名，较内战前每月逃亡数超过四十一倍。其余时间不明者，四十四名。逃亡官佐中计有某地中将守备司令王毅，军部少将处长曾光汉，前三战区少将督察蒋光启等，包括三百九十个单位，绝大部分系蒋嫡系部队。逃亡原因，大部为“意志不坚”、“临阵脱逃”、“畏惧作战”、“弃职潜逃”等，逃亡地点，大半在内战前线。
