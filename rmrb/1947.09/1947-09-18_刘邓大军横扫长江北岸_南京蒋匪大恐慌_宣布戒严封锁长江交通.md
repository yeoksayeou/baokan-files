Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th. The People's Liberation Army's Liu and Deng army is sweeping forward along the northern bank of the Yangtze River, causing panic among Chiang Kai-shek's bandits in Nanjing. According to Associated Press reports from Nanjing on the 14th and 15th: Because there were originally no "Nationalist troops (Chiang bandits)" in the vast areas north and south of the Yangtze River, Chiang Kai-shek urgently transferred a "considerable number" of his naval vessels, including Japanese reparations ships, from Shanghai to the upper reaches of the Yangtze River west of Nanjing. The Chiang family's Railway Administration also ordered armored vehicles to patrol the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway. A spokesman for the Chiang bandit Nanjing River Defense Command also confirmed that traffic on the Yangtze River in the suburbs of Nanjing and upstream of Nanjing has been blocked, prohibiting residents on and near the river in Nanjing from activity between 9:00 PM and 6:00 AM. Martial law took effect on the 13th. Chiang's military "strategists" are all nervously speculating whether Liu and Deng's army will go straight to central Jiangxi, or continue south to establish a new base in Guangxi.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 15th. According to a French News Agency report from Nanjing on the 14th: The Communist army (People's Liberation Army) is now only fifty miles (equivalent to one hundred and fifty Chinese miles) from Nanjing. The military authorities (Chiang bandits) here have ordered martial law to be implemented along the Yangtze River area in Nanjing district after 9:00 PM.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th. The Chiang bandits in Shenyang are in extreme panic due to fears that the Northeast Democratic Allied Army will launch a "sixth largest offensive." According to the Associated Press: The city gates are half-closed every day, and after noon, merchants are only allowed to enter, not to leave. Chiang's army and police are frantically conscripting laborers to rush to repair fortifications, and sentries are densely deployed on the streets and around the city. At night, the Chiang bandits become extremely nervous, mistaking every bush and tree for an enemy soldier, and often fire dense artillery shells at the outside of the city, causing a great commotion with gunfire, and the whole city is in panic. Market prices are soaring, and recently red sorghum has skyrocketed to 400 yuan per catty (equivalent to 5,200 yuan of Chiang currency) or more. Ordinary citizens can only drink two thin bowls of porridge a day, and rice riots have occurred in Shenyang, with several incidents occurring every day recently.

Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 16th. While Chiang's bandit lackeys are panicking and shouting that the Democratic Allied Army is "about to launch its sixth offensive," the morale of the Chiang bandits trapped in isolated points and lines in the Northeast is even lower, and they are fleeing one after another. The fleeing trend is most prevalent in the southern section of the China Changchun Railway. Many soldiers openly stated: "There is nothing to do." The 14th Regiment of the Pseudo-Northeast Security Fifth Detachment, originally with more than 500 soldiers, now has only more than 300 soldiers left, and only 70 soldiers remain in one of its battalions. A squad of the pseudo-security team stationed in the western suburbs of Liaoyang recently went out to repair power lines and deserted completely. The Chiang army along the Dashiqiao, Yingkou, and Haicheng lines is generally developing a "the boat follows the rudder, the grass follows the wind" mentality. There have also been three or four desertion incidents in these three strongholds since August. Chiang's army in Hebei-Chahar-Jin-Liao is also experiencing a strong desertion trend. Soldiers of the 266th Regiment of the 13th Army of Chiang's bandits who escaped from Gubeikou said: After the Chiang bandits in that area heard the news of the establishment of the Liangguang Column of the Liberation Army, the soldiers who had been captured from various parts of Liangguang were even more eager to escape. The 226th Regiment originally had more than 400 new recruits, and more than 200 deserted. Yu Chongjun, a deserter from the 21st Division of the 92nd Army of Chiang's bandits entrenched in the Linyu area, said: A squad that was captured from Tongxian and replenished into the transportation company of the unit deserted completely. Incomplete statistics of the unit in June and July show that a total of 95 platoon leaders and lower deserted. According to Chiang's bandit secret documents seized by the Liberation Army during the Kangbao and Huade operations: "Zhang Jinhua, the squad leader of the 9th Company of the 91st Regiment of the 31st Division of the Provisional Third Army, and soldiers Guo Zhengyi and others, deserted with a machine gun while on sentry duty. Wang Yuxi, the company commander of the New Cavalry 11th Regiment, led 43 soldiers with 4 machine guns, 27 rifles, and 48 war horses to mutiny at their station."

    【新华社陕北十六日电】人民解放军刘邓大军沿长江北岸横扫前进，使南京蒋匪手足慌乱，据美联社十四、十五两日自南京报导：因为长江南北广大地区原先并无“国军（蒋匪）”，故蒋介石飞调其“相当数量”的海军船只，包括日本赔偿舰船在内，由上海急驶南京以西的长江上游。蒋家铁路管理局亦下令以装甲车巡逻沪宁铁路。蒋匪南京江防司令部发言人亦证实：南京近郊与南京以上的长江上游交通实行封锁，禁止南京江上与近郊的居民在夜晚九时至清晨六时之间活动，戒严于十三日生效。蒋军的“战略家”们都很紧张地纷纷揣测：刘邓大军或将直下江西中部，或继续南进，在广西建立新根据地。
    【新华社陕北十五日电】据法国新闻社南京十四日电称：共军（人民解放军）现距南京仅仅五十哩（合一百五十华里）。此间军事当局（蒋匪）已下令下午九点钟以后南京区长江一带实行戒严。

    【新华社东北十六日电】当蒋贼奴才连日惊叫民主联军“即将发动第六次攻势”的哄乱声中，困守东北各孤立点线的蒋匪士气更加低落，纷纷逃亡。其中以中长路南段各地逃风最盛，许多士兵都公开表示：“已无啥干头。”蒋伪东北保安第五支队十四团，原来士兵五百多人，现只剩下三百多人，其中一个营跑的只剩下七十人。驻辽阳西郊一带之伪保安队一个班，日前出外修理电线，全部哗散。大石桥、营口、海城一线的蒋军，普遍滋长着“船随舵转草随风”的心理，该三据点自八月份来发生的逃跑事件亦有三、四起。冀察晋辽各地蒋军风逃亦盛，从古北口逃出的蒋匪十三军二六六团士兵称：该地蒋匪听到解放军两广纵队成立的消息后，原由两广各地抓来的士兵逃心更切，其二二六团原有四百余名新兵，逃跑二百余。盘踞临榆一带的蒋匪九二军二十一师逃兵于宠君称：从通县抓去补入该部运输连的一个班全部逃亡，该部在六、七月内不完全统计：共逃排长以下九十五名。另据解放军于康堡、化德作战时缴获的蒋匪秘密文件中日供：“暂三军卅一师九一团第九连一班长张金华及士兵郭正义等四人，于放哨时携机枪一挺逃亡。新骑师十一团连长王玉玺率士兵四十三名携机枪四挺、步枪二十七支、战马四十八匹于驻地哗变。”
