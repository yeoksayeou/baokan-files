    Wu'an Seventh District Arranges Harvesting and Planting
    Plans to Expand Wheat Fields by Over Ten Thousand Mu
    [Our Newspaper's Report] On the 22nd of this month, the Seventh District of Wu'an arranged for autumn harvesting and wheat planting at a district-wide village cadre meeting. The wheat planting plan aims to reach over 40,000 mu (total cultivated land in the district is over 79,000 mu), exceeding last year's 26,000 mu by 14,000 mu. In Yangyi, out of more than 110 qing of cultivated land, it is planned to plant wheat on 70%, approximately 80 qing. The ten villages in the Berlin base point plan to reach 60% (in previous years, at most, half was planted). The upper half of the district has newly built a lot of irrigated land, planning to expand from 30% last year to 50%. According to statistics from 33 villages in the district, from the beginning to the end of the month, farmers have utilized the gap between weeding and autumn harvest to compost 260,000 loads of fertilizer. Including previously accumulated human and animal manure, sheep manure, wheat bran, sesame cake, and vegetable seed manure, generally, each mu of wheat land can receive 15 loads. Last year, Yangyi had at most 10 loads per mu; this year, it can reach 15 loads. Some preferential land of revolutionary martyrs' families can even reach 20 loads. According to farmers in the town, the masses are more actively engaged in collecting fertilizer this year than in any previous year. Many people are sweeping street soil, collecting manure, digging wet soil (livestock urine) on the roads, scraping grass, and collecting old manure. One reason is that farmers have generally been allocated wheat land; another reason is that mutual aid groups are playing a greater role than in the past, focusing tightly on this task. Some farmers worried that planting too much wheat would affect the planting of cotton and grain next year, but most farmers believed that based on the experience of this spring, with rain in the dog days, planting more wheat, and then planting more mung beans and corn, could also result in good harvests.

    [Our Newspaper's Wu'an Report] In Nanhe Village, Wu'an Ninth District (one of the model production villages) where Zhang Xigui, the second-class labor hero of the Taihang District, is located, since the beginning of this month, the masses have generally been actively accumulating fertilizer by utilizing the gap between the third weeding and the autumn harvest. Members of various mutual aid groups are going to the slopes in groups of three or five to cut artemisia, dig grass, and even scrape the turf from the cracks in the rocks. Statistics from the 6th to the 12th of this month show that over 6,000 loads (over 12,000 dan) of new fertilizer have been composted. Many farmers are scraping wall soil to compost fertilizer. In the first group alone, four or five households have already started scraping. The farmers said this is a "wall-changing movement," "We live in liberated houses (landlords' houses) and we must also have liberated walls." It is said that this kind of old wall soil is a very good fertilizer; the wall soil from three rooms is enough to plant one mu of wheat, which can yield one or two more dou. The leadership is preparing to call for a widespread wall-changing movement. Because in addition to accumulating fertilizer, the new walls are also clean and sanitary. The mutual aid group in this village plans to plant 15 qing of wheat on 29 qing of land (out of the village's total of 31 qing), which is 3 qing more than before. Each mu of land is expected to receive 15 loads of fertilizer, including both new and old. The great autumn harvest is still more than half a month away, and farmers are still intensifying their efforts to accumulate fertilizer. (Guo Dianbang)

    武安七区布置收种
    计划扩大麦田万余亩
    【本报讯】本月廿二日武安七区在全区村干大会上布置秋收、种麦。种麦计划要达到四万亩以上（全村耕地共七万九千多亩），较去年之二万六千亩超过一万四千亩。阳邑一百一十多顷耕地，则准备以百分之七十种麦约八十顷。柏林基点十个村准备达到百分之六十（往年至多种一半），上半区就新修水地不少，准备由去年之百分之三十扩大到五十。该区卅三村统计，月初至月终，农民利用锄苗后至秋收空隙，已沤肥有廿六万驮。连上旧积之人畜粪、羊粪、麦糠、麻饼、小菜籽粪，一般能达到每亩麦地十五驮。阳邑去年至多每亩十驮，今年可达到十五驮。抗属麦地有些可上至二十驮。据该镇农民谈，今年群众闹粪比以往任何年闹的紧。扫街土的、拾粪的、在大路上挖湿土（牲口尿）的、刮草皮、搜集陈粪的很多。一个原因是农民普遍分得麦地，另一原因是互助组比过去都起作用，抓的紧。有些农民怕种麦多了影响明年种棉、谷，大部农民则根据今春经验，伏天有雨多种麦，明年麦收了，多种些绿豆、玉茭也未尝不能好收。（而东）
    【本报武安讯】太行区二等合作英雄张喜贵所在的武安九区南河底村（生产模范村之一）从本月初开始，群众普遍利用锄过三遍苗后到秋收的空隙，积极积肥。各互助组成员三五成群，到坡上去割蒿、刨草、连石头缝里的草皮都刨了。本月六日至十二日统计，已沤新粪六千多驮（一万二千多担）。有许多农民正在刮墙土沤粪。仅第一组即已有四、五户开始刮。农民说这是换墙运动，“住了翻身房（地主房子）还要有翻身墙。”据说：这种旧墙土是很好的肥料，三间房的墙土够种一亩麦，能多打一、二斗。领导上正准备号召一个普遍的换墙运动。因为除了积肥外，新墙也干净、卫生。该村互助组二十九顷地（全村三十一顷），准备种十五顷麦（比以前多三顷），每亩地预计连新带旧可上十五驮粪。大秋收尚须半月多才到，农民现仍在加紧积肥。（郭殿邦）
