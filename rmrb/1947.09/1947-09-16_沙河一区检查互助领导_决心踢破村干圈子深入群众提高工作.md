　　Shahe First District Checks on Mutual Aid Leadership
  　Determined to Break Through the Village Cadre Circle, Go Deep into the Masses, and Improve Work
    [Report from our newspaper in Shahe] All cadres in the First District, in checking the problems of leadership style in organizing mutual aid, made profound reflections and self-criticisms, and gained much in terms of transforming their work style in the future. At the beginning, everyone believed that the reason why mutual aid organizations could not be rapidly improved was the fault of the village cadres, saying that they were not working hard enough or actively enough. But when asked to talk about the details of a village or a team, they were stumped. Comrade Fan Yujin said, "For that joint defense of mine, I only knew that the mutual aid in Hewan Village was good, and that Southwest Gully was not good, but I couldn't say exactly how it was good and how it was bad." Some could give a general idea, saying that the mutual aid was very lively and vigorous, and that work points and equivalent exchange were implemented, but how did his team become lively? What problems occurred in the team? How were they solved? Who benefited from the equivalent exchange, and who suffered losses? What were the reactions of each team member? These questions were difficult to answer clearly. Then everyone recalled that the reason why mutual aid could not be rapidly developed was not only the fault of the village cadres, and from then on, they examined themselves. After everyone's self-criticism and speeches, they found that there were still some problems with their leadership style, the specific manifestations and roots of which are as follows: 1. Administrative orders, simplistic style: The main reasons for this style are as follows: The first is the desire to show off; Niu He said: "In order to want the higher-ups to say that I am good, to show off a bit, I order the cadres and the masses in the village to organize quickly, to make it as fast as possible, as lively as possible, but in reality it is empty, and mutual aid cannot be consolidated." Xu Wenxiang said: "Seeing that other villages are organized, I also urge the cadres to do it quickly, and criticize them if they are slow." The second is that they only dislike the masses for being backward, but they do not personally take the lead, nor have they ever gone to a team to help. When they see that people have not done well, they get angry. The third is to try to catch a big one, and when they go to a village, they want to do all the work in the whole village at once, and all the labor in the whole village must be organized, and they cannot leave behind the lonely, widowed, and lazy, and they also demand that it be done quickly, so they have to resort to coercion and command. The big one was not caught, and the small one was not done well either. 2. Not completely serving the masses, but following the cadre route: The specific manifestation is that once something is arranged, everything is fine. Many comrades make this mistake, the work is superficial, and only done on the cadres. Shi Qiyun said: "When helping the masses hoe the ground, I don't go to the team, I just hoe with the cadres for a while, and even if I understand something, it is only what the cadres say." Xu Wenxiang heard that Li Sini's team had collapsed while working in Wangjian Village, so he asked the village cadres to solve it for him. After two days, he asked the village cadres what was going on, and the village cadres said that there was nothing, so he just perfunctorily let it go. The same is true for collecting materials. When the district holds a meeting, they are busy holding cadre meetings and team leader meetings in the village to collect materials. They all say that everything is perfect, without any problems. They don't participate in team meetings, so how can they understand clearly? Shi Zhengyun said: "Some of the masses' homes are not very clean, so we don't want to go to their homes to eat. We have really forgotten what our past class origin was." Niu He said: "In the home of × cadre, we eat noodles with a layer of eggs on top, and we feel happy eating it. In the homes of the masses, we eat corn buns and drink vegetable soup, and we don't feel comfortable, so how can we talk to them about more problems? How can we understand the masses this way?" 3. Running-aroundism and bureaucratism: Some people wear a straw hat and carry a stick, running from this village to that village, and then from that village to this village. As a result, neither village is done well, and the situation in neither village is clearly understood.
    After the self-criticism, everyone discussed how to go deeper. Fan Yujin said: "When I returned home, I went to the fields and saw clearly whether the crops were growing well or badly. When I saw that the grape seedlings needed to be thinned, I immediately started working and knew how much I had done. When leading mutual aid at work, if I don't go up the mountain to eat dates or look for sweet melons, and I don't personally do it, how can I understand clearly? In the future, leading mutual aid must be like being in my own home to be able to do it well. Sometimes, the team leaders work hard all day, but we force them to hold meetings and report on the situation. Isn't this a problem of not going deep?" Peng Shuangchou said: "Cui Guangyun participated in the mutual aid team in Zuocun and worked like the team members, and the work was done well. The situation is understood, and he also earned a portion of wages in grain. We must do this in the future." Niu He said: "It is not enough for us to just hoe the ground and carry stones with the masses. We must also pay attention to understanding the thoughts of each team member, how to summarize and spread any achievements and experiences, and how to solve problems. We must pay attention to solving them at all times." An Yuqin said: "In the past, I only thought that others could go deep because they were capable. Now I see that it is a problem of using their brains. In the future, we must use our brains more to think about problems." Finally, Political Commissar Li proposed: "Work must not only go deep, but also use our brains more. Disliking the masses for being unclean and eating poorly is even more of a phenomenon of being divorced from the masses. We must correct this in the future, get closer to the masses, understand problems, and solve problems, so that our production and mutual aid work can be done quickly." (Kui Lin)

### 沙河一区检查互助领导　决心踢破村干圈子深入群众提高工作

　　沙河一区检查互助领导
  　决心踢破村干圈子深入群众提高工作
    【本报沙河讯】一区全体干部在检查组织互助中的领导作风问题中，都作了深刻的反省和自我检讨，对今后改造作风上，得到不少收获。开始大家认为互助组织不能迅速提高的原因，都是村干部的过，说他们不努力、不积极，但是让自己谈一个村或一个组的详细情况时，就傻了眼。范雨金同志说：“我那联防，光知道河弯村的互助好，西南沟不好，到底怎样好，怎样不好，我就说不上来了。”有的也能说个大概，互助的很热闹，很起劲儿，实行了工票和等价交换，但是他组怎样热闹起来的？组里都发生过些什么问题？怎样解决的？等价中那些人沾了光，那些人吃了亏？各个组员都有些什么反映？这些问题就很难完全答复清楚了。于是大家都回想起来，互助不能迅速发展的原因，不光是村干部的过，从此便检讨到了自己头上。经大家的检讨和发言后，找出自己的领导作风上还有些毛病，其具体表现和根源有以下几个：一、行政命令，简单作风：造成这种作风的主要原因有以下几点：第一是落好思想；牛和的说：“为了想让上级说自己好，露一鼻子，到村里就命令干部和群众，赶快组织，搞的越快越好，越热闹越好，但实际上是空的，互助不能巩固。”徐文祥说：“见别村组织起来，自己也就催着干部快搞，搞的慢了就批评。”第二是光嫌群众落后，但不亲自下手领导，也没到一个组里去帮助过。看见人家没搞好，就发了脾气。第三是想捉个大的，到那个村里就想把全村工作一下子搞好，全村所有的劳力都要组织起来，又不能剩下孤寡懒汉，还要求搞的快，结果是非强迫命令不可，大的没捉住，小的也没搞好。二、不是完全为群众服务，而是走了干部路线：具体表现在布置一下就万事大吉了，不少同志犯这个毛病，工作漂浮，只作到干部身上。石起云说：“帮助群众锄地，不到小组里去，光和干部们云锄一会，纵然了解些啥，也是光从干部嘴里说的。”徐文祥在王渐村工作听说李四妮组垮了台，就让村干部去给他解决一下，过了两天问村干部是怎样一回事，村干部说没有啥，于是就马马虎虎的过去了。收集材料也是这样，区上召开会的时候，就在村里忙着开干部会，组长会，收集材料，他们都说的一面光，没一点毛病，小组会也不参加，这怎样能了解清楚呢？石正云说：“有些群众家里不大干净，咱就不想到他家去吃饭，真是忘了自己过去是啥出身成份了。”牛和的说：“在×干部家里吃的是面条，上头还放一层鸡蛋，自己吃着就痛快。到群众家里吃的是谷面窝窝，喝的菜汤，心里就不大顺当，那还想和他们多谈些问题，这样怎么能了解群众呢？”三、跑腿主义和事务主义，有的人背上个草帽，手里拿一根棍这村跑到那村，那村又走到这村，结果是那个村也没搞好，那个村情况了解也不清楚。
    检讨以后，大家又讨论了怎样深入的问题，范雨金说：“我回到家，到地里去看了看，那块庄稼长的好赖都知道的清楚，见了葡苗该间苗了，就马上下手干起来，做了多少我都知道。到工作岗位上和群众去锄地，不是上山坡去吃枣，就是去找甜瓜吃，自己没亲自下手，怎能了解清楚呢？以后领导互助，非和在自己家里一样，才能深入搞好。有时候，组长们热熬熬的干一天，咱硬叫上人家开会报告情况，这不是不深入的毛病吗？”彭双丑说：“崔光运在左村参加了互助组和组员们一样干，工作搞好了。情况都了解，人家还赚了一部工资米，咱们以后也要这样办。”牛和的说：“咱们光和群众锄地抬石头还不行，还得注意了解每个组员的思想，有了什么成绩经验怎样总结传播，有了问题怎样解决，必须时刻注意解决”。安玉琴说：“从前我只认为别人能深入是有能力，现在我看是用脑筋的过，咱们以后非多用脑筋想问题不行。”最后李政委提出：“工作不但要深入，而且还要多用脑筋，嫌群众不干净、吃的赖，那更是脱离群众的现象，以后一定改正，更多的接近群众了解问题，解决问题，咱们的生产互助工作才能很快的搞好。”（奎林）
