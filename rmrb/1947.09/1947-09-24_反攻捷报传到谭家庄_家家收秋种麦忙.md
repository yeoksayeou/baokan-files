Reports of victory are blossoming everywhere. The special edition announcing the start of the counter-offensive reached Tan Family Village in Chaocheng on the 14th. At that time, the young and strong were busy harvesting in the fields, but at noon, when the women delivered the meals, they brought the news to the fields. In the evening, the loudspeakers on the rooftops called for a meeting. Drums and gongs shook the earth, beating loudly in the square. The children's corps whistles blew from east to west, and people crowded into the square.

The sounds of gongs and drums began to stop, and the working comrades explained the news in detail again, and called on everyone to cooperate with the counter-offensive and plant more wheat. When he said that Commander Liu had reached the banks of the Yangtze River, more than a thousand li away from here, the masses stirred with excitement.

He recalled that last year, when everyone had ground white flour to prepare for a good year, old Chiang Kai-shek had advanced to Guancheng and attacked the edges of the villages. Everyone was preparing to flee to the sunny slopes with their livestock. Old Man Tan Laosan, who sold cabbage, was captured by Chiang's army on his way back from the market that day and forced to be a porter. Later, he was asked to change into a yellow military uniform in the company. Tears welled up in his eyes: "General, I am a farmer, and my family of five depends on me!" He knelt down and begged to be allowed to return, but he was only beaten senselessly with rattan canes. It took him half a month to sneak back, and even now his body is still marked with scars.

Remembering this hatred, he touched his scars and roared at the meeting: "Old Chiang, if I catch you, I, this old man, will skin you alive!" The village head also returned from a meeting in the district. He reported to everyone an urgent task: to support the front line with 4,000 jin of counter-offensive grain within three days (Note: Advance borrowing of autumn public grain), with 1,000 jin to be completed tomorrow. This sudden event caused a stir among many people. It would be easy to prepare wheat, but how could they get enough millet in time? The millet was still in the fields, and not all of it had been harvested. Moreover, due to the drought this spring, millet could not be planted, and everyone planted corn. Only a few families had planted millet.

The village head thought: to complete this task, only those who planted millet could lend it out first. So he said to the masses: "I have two mu of millet planted, which can be divided into two cloth bags. I will harvest and thresh it tomorrow and lend it out first." This was like lifting the lid, and it was like a swarm of bees buzzing. Some could thresh one or two bags, and some had one or two dou of old millet stored, and they all offered to lend it out. In a moment, a total of twenty-two cloth bags were borrowed, exceeding the task. The next day, men and women, old and young, launched a surprise harvest on the fields and threshing grounds, and excited筒sounds were heard everywhere.

The discussion on planting wheat began on the evening of the 17th. This evening, the loudspeaker only broadcast once, and everyone crowded into the square, rushing over with their bowls before they had finished their soup. The meeting began with the village head and the agricultural association chairman explaining that to cooperate with the counter-offensive and support the front line, more wheat must be planted. Then everyone began to discuss.

Old Man Tan Laosan stood up and said: "I'll set up a challenge, who dares to compete with me? Last year, I planted four mu of wheat on my seven mu of land. This year, after the land reform, I got six more mu, for a total of thirteen mu. I have to plant eleven mu of wheat. I will plow deep and plant well, so the livestock can have plenty of feed." After he finished speaking, a 25-year-old young man named Chen Guangjiang walked up to Old Man Tan and said: "We'll compete with you. I have a total of nine mu of land, including the land I was given. I have to plant eight mu of wheat, and I guarantee to complete it by the 15th day of the eighth lunar month."

"We guarantee to complete it by the 14th!" Tan Laosan roared again, beating his chest, saying: "I'll have my wife and children push the mill to grind flour, so we can free up the livestock!" "We'll also have our wives and children pull it!" Chen Guangjiang also chimed in. Groups competed with groups, and people competed with people, and the shouts became a cacophony. It was not until midnight, after the autumn plowing and wheat planting plans for each group and individual were recorded, that the meeting was dismissed.

After Chen Guangjiang returned home, he did not sleep soundly all night. Sometimes he got up to light a cigarette, or go to check on the livestock, always thinking about how to win the model title and beat Old Man Tan Laosan. He thought that for three generations, his family had never had a good day. His father was beaten until he vomited blood for picking up an ear of grain from the landlord. During the famine years, he was so hungry that he had to flee to Jinan City, and he never had a good cotton-padded coat to wear in winter. Now, after the land reform, he had cotton-padded coats and land. He suddenly thought about how to plow the field deep, how to hold the plow straight and level, and when the seedlings grew up, he had to hoe them three or four times, not letting a single weed stay in the field.

At this time, his wife woke him up from his dream: "Hey, you should get up and plow the fields!" He woke up from his dream, jumped up, and went to harness the livestock. When he pulled the plow into the field, Old Man Tan had already plowed three furrows. Old Man Tan was just laughing inside. Chen Guangjiang whipped the livestock, saying as if complaining and comforting: "Uncle Three, watch, I'll catch up with you!"

    反攻捷报传到谭家庄
    家家收秋种麦忙
    【本报冀鲁豫二十二日电】捷报都四面开了花，反攻开始的号外，在十四日就传到朝城谭家庄。这时，青壮年都忙地里收割，但到晌午时分，妇女去送饭的时候，把消息带到地里，到晚上屋顶上的广播筒叫开会了，锣鼓震天动地，在广场上大打大擂，儿童团的哨音从东头吹到西头，人都挤到场上来。锣鼓声开始停止了，工作同志再把消息详细说了一遍，并号召大家配合反攻，要多小麦。当他说到刘司令打到长江边，离这里有一千多里路的时候，群众兴奋的轰动起来。记得去年大家都磨了白面准备过个好年的时候，老蒋开到观城、打向村庄的边缘，大家都为着牲口准备向阳彀跑，卖白菜老汉谭老三那天赶集回来，在半路被蒋军捉去当了挑夫，后来又叫他到连里换了黄军衣，他目眶里的泪水只汪汪的往下流：“老总”俺是庄稼人，俺家五口子靠俺一个人呢！”他跪下去乞求放他回去；但那就只是用藤条没头没脑的抽打。过了半个月，他才溜了回来，直到现在他的身上还给印着伤痕。这时他记起这仇恨，摸摸伤痕之后，在会场上咆哮起来：“老蒋呀，要是捉住你，我老汉要剥你的皮”。村长到区里开会也回来了。他向大家报告一个紧急任务：三天内要支援前线四千斤反攻粮（按：预借秋季公粮），明天一日必须完成一千斤。这突然起来的事情，引起许多人骚动，要是准备麦子倒容易，但要小米怎能来的及呢？现在谷子都在地里，还没有全割回来，况且今春天旱谷子种不上，都种了玉蜀黍，种上谷子的仅几家可数。村长心里想：这个任务要完成，只有种谷子的先借出来。于是他向群众说：“我种有二亩谷子，能分二布袋，明天割回来打了，先借出来。”这象掀开了盖，就象蜂子一样闹起来，有的能打一布袋二布袋，有的存老谷一斗二斗，都报借出来。一刻工夫，共借二十二布袋，超过了任务。第二天地里场上男女老少突击收获，到处听到兴奋的筒声。
    十七日晚开始讨论种麦的问题了，这天晚上，广播筒只广播一遍，大家都挤到场上来，还没有喝完汤就端着碗赶来。会议开始、先由村长、农会长说明配合反攻支援前线要多种麦的事情后，大家就酝酿起来。还是老汉谭老三站起来说：“我立个擂，谁敢和我比赛？我去年七亩地种四亩麦子，今年翻了身，又分了六亩，共十三亩，我得种十一亩麦子，我要犁得深种得好，给牲口多吃料。”大家等他说完，一个廿五岁的青年陈光江，走到老汉的面前说：“咱和你比赛，我连分的地共九亩，我得种八亩麦子，保证阴历八月十五完成”。“咱保证十四日完成”，谭老三又咆哮起来，打着胸口说：“咱叫老婆小孩推碾子磨面，腾出牲口来；”“咱也叫老婆孩子去拉他！”陈光江也抢着要。组与组比赛，人与人比赛，叫喊声闹成一片。直到半夜，把各组个人比赛秋耕种麦的计划记好之后，才散会。
    陈光江回家之后，一夜没有睡熟，有时起来打火抽一抽烟，或去看看牲口，心里老想着怎样能夺得模范，赢了老汉谭老三。他想着从祖三辈以来都没过一天好日子，父亲因拾地主一穗庄稼，被打的吐了血，荒年时饿得没法就逃到济南城里，一辈子过冬也没得一件好棉袄穿。现在翻了身，棉袄有了、地也有了。他忽而又想田怎样犁得深、手要把犁扶正扶平，苗长起来的时候，要锄三遍四遍，不让一根草留在地里。这时小他娘把他从梦中叫醒：“小他爹！朦胧啦，你该起来犁地了吧！”他从梦中惊醒，跳起来就去套牲口，当他把犁拉到地里的时候，老汉见他才来谭老三早犁了三沟，老三，只是肚子里笑，陈光江鞭一鞭牲口，似埋怨似安慰的说：“三爹看吧，我赶得上你！”
