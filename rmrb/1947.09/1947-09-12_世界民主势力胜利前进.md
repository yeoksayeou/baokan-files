Title: The Victory and Advancement of World Democratic Forces

　　The past week has seen democratic forces gain significant victories in various parts of the world.
　　
　　The first piece of heartening news is the unprecedented victory of democratic forces in the Hungarian elections. The Hungarian Communist Party has gloriously become the largest party in parliament, giving a resounding slap in the face to the American and British reactionaries who unreasonably interfered beforehand. This demonstrates that the evil hand of American and British reactionaries is absolutely incapable of stopping the forward development of democratic forces. Secondly, the full-scale offensive of the Greek Democratic Army continues its victorious advance. Starting from its northern base, the offensive spearhead is pointed towards the central and southern heartland of Greece, with the vanguard reaching eighty kilometers northwest of Athens. Wherever their military prowess reaches, the enemy is routed. Under the power of the Democratic Army's growing offensive, the Greek reactionaries and their Yankee bosses are panicked, descending into chaos. The Tsaldaris one-party dictatorial cabinet, barely formed, is already teetering; this forces American imperialism to hastily send another envoy to Greece, attempting to salvage the "current predicament of Greece."
　　
　　Within the United States, Britain, and France, this week saw the outbreak of vigorous workers' movements against the reactionary measures of their respective governments. On Labor Day in the United States, hundreds of thousands of workers held magnificent rallies and parades, staging a general demonstration against anti-labor laws. The struggle of the American working class against anti-labor laws has deepened and won initial victories. Many large enterprise capitalists have now been forced to refrain from invoking the law. This anti-labor measure, condemned as "the first step towards American-style fascism," has encountered insurmountable difficulties. British miners, in response to the authorities' reactionary policy of "eat less and work more," have begun a considerable strike movement. As of the 5th, the number of participants in the strike has reached 60,000, and the coal lost due to the strike is calculated at 60,000 tons per day. Many mines have therefore closed. Although the Labour government is running around and appealing, the strike movement continues to expand. In France, the large-scale strikes and demonstrations held by workers against the reduction of food rations have spread from Paris to the whole country, with workers angrily shouting, "Ramadier get out!" This has frightened Ramadier so much that he has had to ask the parliament for another vote of confidence. Although the united reactionaries allowed Ramadier to barely obtain the parliament's confidence with a pitiable number of votes, the foundation of the current government has been increasingly shaken by the widespread dissatisfaction of the masses and the current difficulties.
　　
　　On the other hand, Anglo-American relations are also a noteworthy international event of the past week. In order to get rid of the "first time in four hundred years that there is no way" (Bevin's words) of difficulty, the British Labour government had fantasized about getting help from the United States, but the result was a complete failure. In desperation, Bevin even naively asked to "redistribute" the gold in the vaults of the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank, but only added material for the arrogant American master to joke about. The U.S. Treasury Department spokesman even sarcastically said: "If Britain wants gold, it can come to the United States to buy it, at thirty-five dollars an ounce." Currently, the United States regards Britain's difficulties as an advantage to raise the price of "aid" to Britain; U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Lovett said on the 3rd that Britain should produce more daily consumer goods instead of producing tools of production; and Tyden, a big capitalist who traveled in Western Europe for four months, even advocated that "Britain should welcome American entrepreneurs and let them take important positions." On the other hand, in order to overcome the dollar crisis, Britain has launched a movement to boycott American goods and is discussing with members of the British Empire to establish a customs union to resist the dumping of American goods and to enhance its bargaining position with the United States.

### 世界民主势力胜利前进

　　世界民主势力胜利前进
    这一周来，民主势力在世界各处又获得了显著的胜利。
    头一件振奋人心的大事是民主势力在匈牙利大选中获得了空前的胜利，匈共已荣膺国会第一大党，这对事前无理干涉的美英反动派，还了一记响亮的耳光。说明美英反动派这只魔手是绝对不能阻止民主力量向前发展的。其次，希腊民主军的全面攻势，仍在继续胜利进军中。以北部根据地为起点，攻势箭头指向中南部希腊心脏地区，前锋已抵雅典西北八十公里，军威所至，敌人披靡。在民主军壮大攻势的威力下，希腊反动分子及其花旗老板惊慌失措，步步混乱，曹达利斯一党独裁内阁刚刚组成，即摇摇欲坠；这迫使美帝国主义赶紧又派了一个巡按使到希腊去，企图挽救“希腊当前的困窘形势”。
    在美英法国内，本周内开始爆发了反对各该国政府反动措施的轰轰烈烈的工人运动。九一美国劳动节那天，美国数十万工人举行了雄壮的集会游行，对反劳工法进行了一个总示威。美国工人阶级反劳工法的斗争，已日益深入并赢得初步胜利，现在许多大企业资本家已被迫不敢引用该法案。这一被斥为“走向美国式法西斯主义的第一步”的反劳工措施，已遭遇到了不可克服的困难。英国矿工为对抗当局“少吃饭多做工作”的反动政策，已开始了相当规模的罢工运动。截至五日止，参加罢工的已达六万人，因罢工而损失的煤日以六万吨计，许多矿坑因此关门，目前工党政府虽奔走呼号，但罢工运动仍在继续扩大中。法国工人反对减低口粮所举行的大罢工与示威游行，已从巴黎蔓延全国，工人们愤激地高呼：“拉马第滚蛋！”这吓得拉马第不得不要求议会再作一次信任投票。虽然反动派的联合一致使拉马第侥幸以极可怜的票数获得议会信任，但现政府的基础已因群众的普遍不满与当前的重重难关而日益动摇。
    另一方面，英美关系也是过去一周值得注意的国际事件，英国工党政府为了摆脱“四百年来第一次没有办法”（贝文语）的困难，曾幻想从美国得到援助，但结果却碰得焦头烂额，在无可奈何中，贝文竟天真地要求把美国联邦准备银行金库中的黄金“重新分配”，但只是为骄横的美国主人增添了开玩笑的资料，美财政部发言人甚至挖苦的说：“英国如要黄金，可以到美国来买，一盎司三十五美元。”目前英国的困难已被美国视为有利条件，用以提高对英“援助”的索价；美副国务卿罗维特三日谈话即表示英国应多生产日常消费品，而不生产生产工具；而曾在西欧作四个月旅行之大资本家泰登甚至竟主张“英国应欢迎美国企业家，并让他们担任重要的职位。”另一方面，英国为了克服美元危机，已发起一个抵制美货运动，并与大英帝国各成员商磋订立关税同盟，以对抗美货之倾销，并图增强其对美讨价还价之地位。（九月九日）
