Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd: Regarding the United States' insistence on unilaterally convening a one-sided preliminary peace conference with Japan, a Xinhua News Agency reporter made the following comments on the second anniversary of Japan's surrender.

It must be pointed out that discussing the convening of a preliminary peace conference and drafting a peace treaty with Japan at this time must be based on the fundamental principle stipulated in previous international conferences: that the drafting of treaties with defeated countries should first be subject to unanimous agreement among the major powers. If this principle is not adopted, or is overturned under any pretext, then many of the decisions made at the Potsdam Conference regarding Japan, especially the decision to prevent Japan from endangering the world again, as well as the victory won by the Chinese people through eight years of resistance with enormous sacrifices (including 41 million disaster victims), and the demand to no longer be threatened or invaded by Japan, will not be guaranteed in any way. We absolutely disagree with and oppose the United States unilaterally convening the eleven-nation preliminary conference in violation of this principle. The United States' insistence on this proposition only proves that it is attempting to overturn the Four-Power Agreement in order to exclusively occupy Japan, and then to indulge Japan in invading China and bringing disaster to the Far East. The various facts of the United States fostering the resurgence of Japanese fascist reactionary forces in the past two years have provided sufficient evidence for our explanation.

It is absolutely necessary for the four major powers, China, the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom, to first discuss and draft a preliminary peace treaty in order to thoroughly eradicate the resurgence of Japanese fascism. However, before the establishment of a democratic coalition government, the Chinese representatives attending the conference must be generated from among the Chinese people, and in particular, must include representatives of the people of the liberated areas who made the greatest sacrifices and contributions during the eight years of resistance (they resisted more than 60% of the Japanese army and almost 100% of the puppet troops in China). Without the participation of representatives from the liberated areas, any "Chinese delegation" cannot represent the Chinese people, and the Chiang Kai-shek clique is absolutely not qualified to represent the Chinese people to participate in the peace conference with Japan.

Ever since Chiang Kai-shek betrayed the revolution during the Great Revolution, he has been the number one pro-Japanese traitor: he was the one who sold out the Northeast on September 18th; he was also the one who sold out North China by signing the Tanggu Agreement and other agreements on May 31st; during the War of Resistance, he was passive and negligent in resisting Japan, while actively opposing the people and attacking the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army; he colluded with the Japanese Wang Jingwei regime, sent troops to surrender to the enemy, and even sent representatives to secretly communicate with Japanese representatives such as Kayan Changzhi in Hong Kong before its fall. Chiang Kai-shek's blood ties have nothing to do with the Chinese nation, but his relationship with Japanese fascism is very close.

Therefore, as soon as Japan surrendered, Chiang Kai-shek shouted "love your enemies," treated the war criminal Okamura Neiji as a distinguished guest, invited him to command the civil war, and left a large number of Japanese troops in China to massacre the people. He never said a word against the United States' support for Japan. He obeyed the orders of his American masters to supply Japan with raw materials such as coal, iron, and salt, and to open up Sino-Japanese trade. He remained unmoved by the justice, calls, and public opinion of the Chinese people in opposing this. At a time when the United States unilaterally advocates convening a preliminary peace conference with Japan, he hurriedly agreed, and further advocated amending the veto power, in order to please the public enemies of the Chinese nation, American imperialism and Japanese fascism. Chiang Kai-shek has done everything that the Chinese people are heartbroken about.

In this way, the traitorous clique that alienates itself from China is not qualified to talk about any peace treaty with Japan; similarly, the American imperialist government, which helps the Chiang Kai-shek butcher regime to massacre and attack the Chinese people and completely ignores the public opinion of the Chinese and world people, has no right to stubbornly and unilaterally convene any kind of "peace conference with Japan" for its own purposes.

The Chinese people fought a bloody war against Japanese imperialism and the traitor Wang Jingwei for eight years in order to win national independence. Now, they are still fighting a life-and-death struggle against the traitor Chiang Kai-shek, who is directly supported by American imperialism, for national independence, democracy, and peace. The Chinese people have an unshakable belief that since the power of the people can overthrow Wang Jingwei, who was supported by Japanese imperialism, and Japanese imperialism itself, then the people will certainly have the power to completely end Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous rule, completely smash the Japanese fascists' attempt to re-invade China, and completely drive their backstage boss, American imperialism, out of China. We are confident that the arrival of our victory is not far away. If the US and Chiang Kai-shek still insist on going their own way on the Japanese issue, arbitrarily convene a peace conference, and arbitrarily conclude a peace treaty, planting the seeds of a century of disaster for the Chinese people, then in the final reckoning, the Chinese people know how to deal with it.

### 记者评论对日和会问题力称　蒋介石无资格参加会议  美国单独召开和会违背四国一致协议

　　新华社记者评论对日和会问题力称
  　蒋介石无资格参加会议
    美国单独召开和会违背四国一致协议
    【新华社陕北三日电】对于美国坚持单独召开片面的对日和约初步会议问题，新华社记者于日本投降两周年纪念日作如下评论。
    必须指出，目前来谈召开对日和约的初步会议和草拟对日和约，就必须根据历次国际会议规定对战败国草拟和约应首经强国一致协议的基本原则。如果这原则不被采用，或在任何借口下加以推翻，则波茨顿会议对日本的许多决定，特别是使日本不能再危害世界的决定，与中国人民八年抗战以巨大牺牲（其中灾民就达四千一百万）换来的胜利，以及不再受日本威胁侵略的要求，就不会有任何保障。我们绝对不同意而且反对美国违背这一原则而片面的召开十一国初步和会。美国坚持这一主张，只是证明她企图推翻四强协议，借以独占日本，进而放纵日本侵略中国为祸远东。两年来美国扶植日本法西斯反动势力再起的种种事实，已为我们这一说明提供了充分的证据。
    由中、苏、美、英四强首先讨论并草拟初步和约，为着彻底根除日本法西斯的东山再起，乃是绝对必要的。不过出席会议的中国代表，在民主联合政府未成立之先，必须由中国人民中间产生，特别是必须有抗战八年中牺牲最重，贡献最大（它抗击了在华百分之六十以上的日军和几乎百分之百的伪军）的解放区人民代表参加。如果没有解放区人民代表参加，则任何“中国代表团”决不能代表中国人民，而蒋介石集团是绝对没有资格代表中国人民来参加对日和会的。
    蒋介石从大革命时期叛变革命起，一直是亲日卖国的头号汉奸：九一八出卖东北的是他；五月三十一日签订塘沽协定以及其它协定，出卖华北的也是他；抗战期间对抗战消极怠工，而积极反对人民，与进攻八路军、新四军的是他；与日汪勾结，派兵投敌，以至在香港沦陷前派代表在香港与日本代表如萱野长知之类秘密往还的，统统都是他。蒋介石身上的血缘与中华民族毫无关系，与日本法西斯关系却是密切得很。
    所以，蒋介石在日本刚一投降就大喊“要爱敌人”，把战犯冈村宁次待为上宾，请他指挥内战，把大批日军留在中国屠杀人民。对美国扶植日本，他从未说过半句话。美国主子要他将煤铁盐等原料供应日本，要他开放中日贸易，统统照办。中国人民的正义与呼声与舆论反对，他是毫不动容。在目前美国片面主张召开对日初步和会的时候，他就连忙赞成，并且更进一步主张修改否决权，借此讨好中国民族的公敌美帝国主义与日本法西斯蒂。凡一切中国人民所痛心疾首的事情，蒋介石件件都做了。
    这样，自外于中国的卖国集团既无资格谈任何对日和约；同样的帮助蒋介石屠夫政权屠杀与进攻中国人民与完全无视中国与世界人民公意的美国帝国主义政府，也绝没有权利一意孤行单独的召开什么御用的“对日和会”。
    中国人民为了争取民族独立，对日本帝国主义和汉奸汪精卫血战了八年，如今仍旧为了民族的独立民主与和平，正对美帝国主义直接支持的卖国贼蒋介石作殊死斗，中国人民有一坚定不移的信念，即是人民的力量既然可以打倒日本帝国主义支持的汪精卫与日本帝国主义本身，则人民也必定可以有力量彻底结束蒋介石卖国统治，彻底粉粹日本法西斯蒂重新侵略中国的企图，并彻底将其后台老板的美帝国主义驱逐出中国。我们确信自己胜利的到来，已不在远了。美蒋如果仍要在对日问题上一意孤行，擅开和会，擅订和约，为中国人民埋下百年祸根，那末在最后清算时，中国人民是知道如何处理的。
