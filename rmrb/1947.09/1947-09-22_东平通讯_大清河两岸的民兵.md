    Dongping Correspondence
    The Militia on Both Banks of the Daqing River
    Yang Baming
    When the enemy's main force, the 73rd and 12th Corps, invaded Dongping, the militia formed a working team, armed with two machine guns, and, together with the militia Bao Tiandui [Protect the Fields Team], confronted the enemy on the northeastern edge of the county. On August 2nd, the enemy's vanguard of over 20 men advanced to Hanshantou. Six militiamen guarding the mountain, led by Captain Bu Qingchen, concentrated their fire and repelled them. Then, the enemy attacked with a company. Our six warriors found their positions and, from their high vantage point, wounded two enemies, causing the enemy to collapse immediately. The third time, the enemy surrounded the mountain and attacked with greater force. Because the mountain was small and offered no cover, the six warriors took the initiative to break through the enemy's encirclement and cross the Daqing River to the south. The river was very deep. Militiaman Fu Changxue lost all his clothes, and his ammunition bag fell into the water. He immediately hooked it with his leg and held it and his rifle above his head. Upon reaching the shore, he excitedly pointed to his wet rifle and said, "I didn't have any land for most of my life, and I barely managed to get over nine mu. I would rather die than be a coward." Militiamen Li Mingji and Liu Panchong didn't have time to cross the river and hid in the crops. On that day, the villages on the north bank of the Daqing River were all occupied by the enemy. Seeing that they were surrounded, they hid in the fields, eating raw corn when they were hungry and drinking the yellow water from sorghum leaves. They were soaked by the rain, but they still proudly said, "We'll squat here and see what kind of fruit you bastards bear!" They persisted for seven days and five nights, and whenever there was an opportunity, they would sneak out to fight guerrilla warfare. Another militia working team south of the Daqing River, and a unit of working teams from each district, totaling about 500 people, under the leadership of Director Hu of the County Armed Forces Committee, set up a defense line more than 50 li long on the south bank of the Daqing River from Beida Bridge to Nanchengzi. They built shore defense works on the Daqing River embankment, and the self-defense forces and children's corps also participated in standing guard and keeping watch. Militiamen without guns carried red-tasseled spears and set up earthen cannons. The cannoneers said triumphantly, "If the enemy dares to cross the river, I'll sink his boat with one shot!" To mislead the enemy, they carried two machine guns to the east to fire for a while, and then to the west to fire for a while. The enemy bombarded our machine gun positions with artillery. Our militia sharpshooter, Wu Kaiyuan, jumped out of the fortifications to strike the enemy, and a volley of gunfire made the enemy afraid to raise their heads. The enemy just fired randomly to the east and west, and four Chiang Kai-shek planes shuttled back and forth along the shore, but to no avail. After fighting for a day and a night, the enemy dared not advance or cross the river. At night, the militia saw two gourd-like objects floating on the river surface, slowly coming south. Upon closer inspection, they turned out to be enemies crossing over to launch a surprise attack. The militia fired machine guns at the water targets, and two heads sank into the river in response. The secret crossing plan failed again. The next day, the enemy became enraged and concentrated their artillery fire on several crossing points, such as Liuze and Mazhuang. The militia used the ringing of a bell as a signal to retreat, and Wu Taoyuan as the assembly point to make plans for "the enemy advances, we advance," and safely withdrew after persisting for a certain period of time. Although the enemy fired hundreds of artillery shells, we suffered no casualties, but killed and wounded more than ten enemies. The "National Army" main force, which Chiang Kai-shek boastfully touted, retreated in defeat under the blows of our small number of militiamen.

    东平通讯
    大清河两岸的民兵
    杨八明
    东平翻身农民，在敌人主力七十三军十二军侵占时，民兵组成的武工队，带机枪两挺，会同民兵保田队，在县境东北边缘，迎击敌人。八月二日，敌人先头部队二十余人，进到韩山头，守山六个民兵，在卜庆辰队长领导下，集中火力，将其击退。接着，敌人又来了一个连进攻，我六名勇士，各找阵地，居高临下，打伤了两个敌人，敌人马上溃败。第三次敌人又将山头包围，集中更大的力量进攻，因山头不大，又没隐蔽，六位勇士，便主动冲破敌人包围南渡大清河，河水很深，民兵傅昌学衣服都丢掉了，子弹袋刚落到水里，他马上用腿勾住，连枪一块顶到头上，上得岸来，兴奋的指着湿了的枪说：“我多半辈子没有地，好容易弄了九亩多，死也不能成一个怕死的家伙呀。”民兵李明吉、刘盘中两人，没来得及过河，就躲在庄稼地里。当天大清河北岸的庄子，都被敌人占满了，他们看到周围都是敌人，就在地里隐避，饿了吃点生玉米，喝了就喝高粱叶上的黄水，下雨了，淋得全身湿透，但他们仍然很自豪的说：“咱蹲在这里，看你个龟孙到底结个什么果？”就这样坚持了七天五夜，一有空隙，他们就钻出来打游击。另一在大清河南的民兵武工队，及各区一部武工队约五百余人，在县武委会胡主任领导下，把大清河南岸从北大桥到南城子，布置了五十多里长的防线，在大清河堤上筑了守岸的工事，自卫队、儿童团也参加了站岗放哨。没有枪的民兵，便扛上了红缨枪，摆上了土炮，炮手得意的说：“敌人敢过河，我一炮就打沉他的船！”为了迷惑敌人，将两挺机枪扛到东头打一阵，又到西头打一阵，敌人用炮轰击我机枪阵地，我民兵射击手吴开元便跳到工事外边，去打击敌人，一排枪打得敌人不敢抬头。敌人光是东一炮，西一炮，乱打一阵，四架蒋机在岸边来往穿梭，但毫无办法，打了一天一夜，敌人不敢前进，也不敢过河，夜里民兵看到河面上漂着两个葫芦似的东西，慢慢往南来，仔细看时，原来是渡过来偷袭的敌人，民兵对水上目标，连发机枪，两个脑袋应声沉入河中，偷渡计划，又告失败了。第二天敌人恼羞成怒，集中炮火向流泽、马庄等几个渡口猛击，民兵便以敲钟为撤退记号，以吴桃园为集合地点再作敌进我进的计划，坚持到一定时间，便安全转移了。敌虽然打了几百发大炮，但我们并没一个伤亡，却打死打伤了十多个敌人，蒋军妄自吹嘘的“国军”主力，却在我少数民兵的打击下，垂头败兴而退。
