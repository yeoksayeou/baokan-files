　　[Our newspaper's dispatch from the Jilu豫 region on the 10th] Bo Ping has created a model example of distributing the fruits of labor in the process of implementing the movement of speaking out about suffering, self-reporting merits, and unity, which has become the working direction of the entire county. Li Zhao's Village in the ninth district, which created this model example, is recognized as a model village for distributing fruits. It was awarded a glorious plaque at the Hero Model Conference. In the village's distribution of fruits, it first convened a meeting of the poor peasant league to discuss how to distribute the fruits and fill the poverty gaps. It was decided to use the method of "comparing exploitation" to get through the thoughts of the middle peasants. Then, a general meeting of all farmer members was convened. First, poor peasant member Sun Baoqing spoke out about his suffering. He spoke of how he "carried a burden for three generations and even sold his daughter in years of famine," and couldn't help but burst into tears, causing the entire audience to weep for him. Eighteen or nineteen poor peasants then spoke out about their suffering. Later, the middle peasants also spoke out about their suffering. In comparing their suffering with the poor peasants, the middle peasants realized that the poor peasants suffered more than the middle peasants, and the middle peasants had more possessions than the poor peasants. For example, middle peasant Li Yanping, with a family of five and fifteen mu of land, had an older brother who was a landlord who would not lend him grain when he was hungry, forcing him to go outside the customs. After speaking of his suffering, he realized that the middle and poor peasants are one family, all exploited by the landlord, and reported the things his brother had placed in his house, along with more than two thousand catties of wheat. After speaking out about and comparing suffering, the middle peasants realized that the poor peasants suffered the most and should receive a larger share of the fruits, while the middle peasants should receive less or nothing. This changed the past confused ideas that the poor peasants were "close relatives" and the middle peasants were "stepchildren." Middle peasant Li Qingchun said, "The poor peasants do not exploit the poor. The landlords exploit them and make them poor, and then they exploit us. We unite to fight the landlords. When we distribute the fruits, we middle peasants don't want to share." Therefore, ×× households of middle peasants voluntarily gave up their share of the fruits, and the fruits were distributed among the village's fifty-seven poor peasant households. Twenty reviewers were selected to convert all the items into prices, totaling one million five hundred and forty thousand yuan. Then, based on the economic situation of each poor family, the amount was reviewed and approved, and money tickets were issued to them. They used the money tickets to buy things, buying whatever they lacked. Whoever should receive more bought first, and when the things they bought were enough to reach the amount they should receive, they stopped buying. One poor peasant family, Li Guilin, with seven people and no land, received eighteen mu of land and shared a cow with four families. This time, they were supposed to receive more than 80,000 yuan and bought fifteen pieces of clothing, two large jars, a cart, a mill, a leather suitcase, and a cotton gin. The least amount received was also five thousand yuan. After the distribution of fruits, the middle and poor peasants jointly ate a unity meal, slaughtering two pigs. Because the middle peasants had contributed to the struggle and did not want the fruits, and also worked actively, the poor peasants commended and congratulated the middle peasants. In the evening, an entertainment party was held.

　　博平李招按庄
  　贫雇中农比比苦团结公平分果实
    【本报冀鲁豫十日电】博平在贯澈诉苦自报立功团结运动中，又创造分配果实的模范范例，成为全县的工作方向。创造这一范例的九区李招按庄，被公认为分果实的模范村。荣获英模大会光荣匾之奖励，该村在分果中，首先召开贫民团会议，讨论如何分果实，填穷坑。决定用“比剥削”办法，打通中农思想，接着召集全体农会员大会，先由贫农会员孙宝庆诉苦，诉苦到他：“扛活了三辈子，遇荒年又把女儿卖给了人家”，不禁嚎啕大哭，全场为他落泪。贫农接着诉苦的有十八、九个。后来中农也诉苦。中农在与贫农比苦中，认识到贫农比中农受苦大，中农的家当比贫农强。如中农李延平五口人十五亩地，他亲哥是地主，借粮食就不借给。饿得他下了关外，他在诉苦后认识到中贫农是一家，都受地主剥削，便报出他哥哥放在他家的东西，与两千多斤麦子。诉苦比苦后，中农认识到贫农受的苦最大，应多分果实，中农应少分或不分。改变了过去贫农是“亲的”，中农是“后的”等糊涂思想。中农李庆春说：“贫农不剥削穷的。地主把他们剥削穷，再就剥削咱，咱们联合斗地主，分果实时咱们中农不要分。”于是××户中农自不要果实，有果实由全村五十七户贫农分，并选出二十个评议员，把所有的东西都折成价，共一百五十四万元，再按每家贫富的经济状况，将数目评议好，发给他们钱票，用钱票去买东西，少啥买啥，谁应分的多，谁先买，买的东西凑够了应分的数，就不买了。一家贫农李桂林，七口人没地，分了十八亩地，四家合分一条牛，这次应分八万多元，买了十五件衣服，两口大缸，一辆大车，一个磨，一个皮箱，一架棉花车子。最少的也分到了五千元。分完果实后，中贫农共同吃了一顿团结饭，杀了两口猪，因中农斗争有功，不要果实，还积极干，贫农又给中农立功贺功，晚上又开了个娱乐晚会。
