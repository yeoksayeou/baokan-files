　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th: New York dispatch: Prices in the United States continue to rise. According to Agence France-Presse, Washington, 10th, the cost of living index has doubled compared to 1939. A report released by the US Department of Labor on the 12th also stated that the skyrocketing wholesale prices of 900 items have created a new post-war record, an average increase of 27% compared to last year. The Associated Press's wholesale price index for 35 items, with the pre-war period as 100, reached 191.58 on September 5th, compared to only 140.6 a year ago. The high cost of living has caused widespread resentment among the American people, but Republican Senator Taftshamelessly said: "The solution to the high cost of living is to eat less." (Associated Press, 13th report) The US President's Council of Economic Advisers will again warn in its report to be submitted next month: "The current phenomenon of soaring prices will inevitably lead to economic collapse; if the current trend of rising prices and inflation is not curbed, price controls should be restored."
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 8th: According to TASS, New York, 6th: The New York Herald Tribune revealed that the US President's Council of Economic Advisers will soon submit a report to Truman, warning of the "serious economic difficulties" currently facing the United States. It is reported that the report will be in stark contrast to the committee's previous optimistic reports. Some economists on the committee believe that the ominous signs currently foreshadow a future economic situation that is not a "moderate price drop" but rather the signs of the great crises of 1922 and 1929. They said: This economic crisis may erupt within the next one to four years. The report will state that the price increase policies adopted by major US companies will accelerate the arrival of the crisis.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th: New York dispatch: A mass meeting at Madison Square Garden on the evening of the 11th, sponsored by the "Progressive Citizens of America," aimed to counter the current trend towards fascism and reaction in the United States. 22,000 people participated, and the atmosphere was extremely enthusiastic. Wallace delivered a speech stating: If the Democratic Party continues to be a party of war, a party of high prices and depression, then the people must have a new party of freedom and peace. The entire audience responded with prolonged cheers.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th: New York dispatch: Former US Vice President Wallace delivered an important speech to the Progressive Citizens of America at Madison Square on the evening of the 11th, sharply exposing the essence of the Truman administration's domestic and foreign policies. Wallace said: "Reactionaries are creating a hysterical fear of the Soviet Union and communism, but their real fear is democracy, and the result is that the American people suffer from high prices and economic instability." "This is a great sin in a world that can no longer withstand another war." Wallace reiterated his belief from a speech he gave in the same place a year ago, stating: "Capitalism and communism can coexist peacefully." Wallace strongly attacked the Truman administration's foreign policy, saying: "The current foreign policy of the United States is nominally a bipartisan policy, but in reality, it is guided by the ideas of former President Hoover, implemented by reactionary Wall Street bankers, and headed by Secretary of State Marshall, who is trained in the military." Regarding domestic issues, Wallace strongly criticized Truman and Dewey's vigorously advocated universal military training program and the so-called national loyalty order to purge communists from public office, as well as the Taft-Hartley anti-labor law. Wallace called on American progressives to unite and achieve results at the Democratic National Convention next June. Wallace declared: If the Democratic Party cannot do so, we will surely have a new party of freedom. Regarding China, Wallace said: "We cannot ignore the aspirations of the Chinese people."

　　美国物价飞涨人民普遍怨愤
  　华莱士痛斥杜鲁门
    【新华社陕北十四日电】纽约讯：美国物价继续上升，据法新社华府十日讯，生活指数已较一九三九年增加一倍。美劳工部十二日公布之报告中亦称，九百种物品批发价格之飞涨已造成战后新纪录，较去年平均涨百分之二十七。美联社所制之三十五种物品批发价格指数，以战前为一百，九月五日即高达一九一点五八，一年前仅为一四○点六。物价之昂贵，已引起美国人民之普遍怨愤，但共和党参议员塔虎脱则无耻地说：“解决生活费高涨的办法是少吃一些。”（美联社十三日报）美总统经济顾问委员会将于其下月提出之报告中再度警告：“目前之物价腾贵现象，终不免引起经济崩溃；如果目前的物价高涨与通货膨胀趋势不予制止，即应恢复物价管制。”
    【新华社陕北八日电】据塔斯社纽约六日讯：纽约先驱论坛报透露，美总统经济顾问委员会最近将向杜鲁门提出报告，警告以美国现所面临的“严重经济困难”。据悉，该报告将和该委员会以前的乐观报告截然相反，该委员会若干经济学家认为，目下险恶象征所预示的未来的经济情势不是“温和的跌价”，而是一九二二年和一九二九年大危机的征兆。他们说：这种经济危机可能在今后一年至四年内爆发。该报告将说明，美国各大公司所采取的涨价政策，将加速危机的到来。
    【新华社陕北十六日电】纽约讯：“美进步公民协会”十一日晚主催的麦迪逊广场群众大会，旨在反击美国当前走向法西斯与反动的趋向，参加者达二万二千人，情绪至为热烈。华莱士曾发表演说称：如果民主党继续是一个战争的党，物价高涨与萧条的党，则人民必须有一个自由与和平的新党时，全场对此报以历久之欢呼。
    【新华社陕北十三日电】纽约讯：美前副总统华莱士十一日晚在麦迪逊广场向美国进步公民大会发表重要演说，尖锐地揭露杜鲁门政府的内外政策的实质。华氏称：“反动分子造成对苏联与对共产主义之歇斯的里亚恐惧，但他们真正的恐惧则为民主，其结果使美国人民身受物价高涨与经济不稳之苦。”“此在不能再承受另一次战争之世界上，实为莫大罪过。”华氏重申其一年前在该地演说中之信念称：“资本主义与共产主义可以和平共存。”华氏严词攻击杜鲁门政府外交政策说：“美国目前之外交政策，名义上为两党政策，实则系由前总统胡佛之思想为引导，并由华尔街反动银行家所执行，而以受军事训练之国务卿马歇尔为其首脑。”论及内政问题时，华氏力斥杜鲁门与杜威所极力赞成之普遍军训计划和所谓自公共职务中清洗共产党之效忠国家命令，以及塔虎脱哈特莱之反劳法案。华氏号召美国进步人士团结一致，并于明年六月民主党大会中获致结果。华氏声称：民主党如不能如此，我们必将有自由之新党。关于中国，华氏称：“我们不能漠视中国人民的热望。”
