Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 6th. News workers and the masses here have begun to investigate "Keli Kong" (Empty Talk). The Jin-Cha-Ji Daily recently published three letters from readers exposing factual inaccuracies in reporting. The editors have replied, expressing sincere acceptance and gratitude, and requesting readers to "continue to report" and "raise issues at any time" so that they can "strive to overcome them in future work." Readers pointed out that in the news "Recovering Wangdu and Dingxian," published in the newspaper on August 3rd, it was stated that Dingxian was also recovered in one day. In fact, the enemy sneaked into Dingxian on July 24th and fled in less than an hour. Furthermore, regarding the "Enemy Advancing North from Shijiazhuang, a Total of Four Regiments, Have Also Fled Back, Xin'an Has Been Recovered, and There Are No Enemy Traces on the North Bank of the Hutuo River," published on July 29th, readers pointed out that Zhengding City had not yet been recovered at that time, and the city was located on the north bank of the Hutuo River. The troops fleeing north were two regiments of the 7th Brigade of Chiang's 6th Division and nine squadrons of the Security Police Brigade. The enemy never even reached Xin'an Station this time.

　　晋察冀新闻界及群众
  　开始查“客里空”
    【新华社晋察冀六日电】此间新闻工作者及群众已开始查“客里空”。晋察冀日报最近登载了三封揭发报导失实的读者来信，编辑已复信表示诚恳接受与感谢，要求读者“继续检举”，“随时提出”。以便“在今后工作中努力克服”。读者指出该报八月三日刊登之“收复望都定县”消息中，称定县亦为一日所收复，事实上七月二十四日敌窜入定县不及一小时即窜去。又该报七月二十九日所登之“石庄向北伸进之敌共四个团兵力亦已窜回，辛安已收复，滹沱河北岸已无敌踪”，读者指出当时正定城尚未收复，该城即在滹沱河北岸，而北窜者系蒋军六师七旅之两个团与保警大队九个中队。辛安车站此次敌根本就未到过。
