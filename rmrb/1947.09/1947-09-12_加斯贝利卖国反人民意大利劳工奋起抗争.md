Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 10th: Rome dispatch: One of the characteristics of the Italian political situation in August is the General Confederation of Labor's active opposition to the reactionary measures of the Gasperi cabinet. Since Gasperi's dictatorship three months ago, the gap between Italian prices and the living standards of the working people has widened. Under the authorities' continuous price increases and laissez-faire policies regarding black market activities, electricity prices have risen by 100 percent, kerosene by 20 percent, and tobacco by 25 percent in three months. Since July, however, the cost of living has only increased by about 30 percent. In order to protect the lives of workers, the General Confederation of Labor requested the government in July to adopt a differential rationing system for bread and other flour-based foods, and to confiscate 60 percent of the grain imported privately by merchants for distribution to impoverished people. To protest the Gasperi government's refusal to respond to this request, 152,000 workers in Turin went on strike for two days starting August 19. On August 22, 50,000 workers in the province of Brescia went on strike. Textile, chemical, and metallurgical workers in Naples and Florence also launched similar strikes protesting the excessive cost of living. On August 21, Vittorio, the secretary of the General Confederation of Labor, declared that if the authorities continue to delay their response, the General Confederation of Labor will lead the working people of the whole country to rise up and fight. That evening, the Gasperi Council of Ministers hurriedly discussed the General Confederation of Labor's proposal and decided on certain economic measures, such as forcing importers to allocate 5 percent of their imported goods to the poor, and increasing the monthly ration of sugar and kerosene, but did not mention the differential rationing system. On August 23, Gasperi delivered a radio address stating that differential rationing was "impossible" and reiterated that Italy "cannot revive without American loans," thus revealing his determination to sell out the country and oppose labor. In response to Gasperi's provocation, the General Confederation of Labor issued a declaration on August 27, calling on the people of the whole country to actively participate in the crusade against high prices and speculation. The declaration stated: The time has come to end the system of wantonly profiting from the poverty of the people and the difficulties of the motherland.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 10th: Moscow dispatch: Ms. Dilisha Nosi, a member of the Italian General Confederation of Labor delegation and a member of the Italian Constituent Assembly, (Note: The delegation arrived in the Soviet Union on the 26th of last month at the invitation of the Central Council of Trade Unions of the Soviet Union) told TASS reporters on the 5th that since its establishment in January 1945, the Italian General Confederation of Labor has increased its membership by 2.5 million and now has 7 million workers and civil servants. There are 57 trade unions under the General Confederation of Labor. The General Confederation of Labor's struggle to defend the basic interests of the people has been deeply supported by the Italian working class. The General Confederation of Labor has won an increase in unemployment benefits for workers from 50 lira to 200 lira; however, the families of the unemployed are still in starvation, and the number of unemployed people has reached 2.5 million. The Italian ration is only 200 grams (approximately 5.36 taels) per day. Although the working class is actively participating in the restoration work, the restoration of Italian industry is very difficult under the constraints of the American and British occupation forces and the supervision of the American police.

　　加斯贝利卖国反人民意大利劳工奋起抗争
    【新华社陕北十日电】罗马讯：八月份内意大利政情的特点之一，是总工会积极对抗加斯贝利内阁之反动措施。加斯贝利专政三个月以来，意大利物价与劳动人民生活水平之间的悬殊日益加大。在当局连续的涨价措施及放任投入黑市的政策下，三个月内电费涨百分之百，煤油涨百分之二十，烟草涨百分之二十五。而自七月份以来，生活费则仅增约百分之三十。为保障工人的生活，总工会于七月间要求政府采取对面包等面粉食物的差额配给制，并将商人私人进口粮食没收百分之六十分配给贫困的民众。为抗议加氏政府对此要求的拒不作答，都灵十五万两千工人于八月十九日起罢工两天，八月二十二日布里西亚省五万工人实行罢工，那不勒斯及佛罗伦萨的纺织业、化学业及冶金业工人亦发动了同样的抗议生活费用过昂的罢工。八月二十一日，总工会书记维特利奥宣称：如果当局再拖延不复，则总工会即将领导全国劳动人民起来斗争。当晚，加氏部长会议即赶忙讨论总工会的建议，并决定若干经济措施，如强迫进口商以进口货百分之五分配予贫民，增加每月食糖与煤油的配给量等，但是不提差额配给制。八月二十三日，加斯贝利发表广播演说称：差额配给是“不能实现的”，并再次强调意大利“没有美国贷款就没有复兴”，而表明其卖国与反劳工的决心。为回答加斯贝利的挑衅，总工会于八月二十七日发表宣言，号召全国人民积极参加反对高价及投机的十字军。宣言称：现在是结束利用人民贫困及祖国困难而恣意获利之制度的时候了。
    【新华社陕北十日电】莫斯科讯：意大利总工会代表团团员、意国立宪议会会议员第利沙·诺西女士，（按该代表团系应苏联职工会中央的邀请，于上月二十六日抵苏访问）五日接见塔斯社记者称：意总工会自一九四五年一月成立以来，会员已增加两百五十万，现拥有七百万工人及公务员；在总工会下所属工会达五十七个。总工会为保卫人民大众基本利益的斗争，已深受意国工人阶级之拥戴，总工会已为工人争得失业补助金由五十里拉增至二百里拉；但失业者的家庭现仍陷于饥饿，失业人数达二百五十万人。意国口粮配给每日仅两百格兰姆（约合五两三钱六分），虽然工人阶级正积极参加恢复工作，但在美英占领军及美国警察监督的束缚之下，意国工业的恢复甚感困难。
