Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, September 17th: Comprehensive reports indicate that although "this year's harvests in various rice-producing areas are quite discouraging" (Associated Press), Shanghai rice prices continue to surge. On the 15th, each dan [unit of weight] rose to 630,000 yuan, and on the 16th, it reached 650,000 yuan, exceeding any previous record. This also affects the soaring prices of various other goods, especially export commodities such as soybeans, textiles, and raw silk, which are about to be exported. The black market dollar has also risen to a multi-week high of 48,500 yuan. The soaring rice prices in Shanghai are clearly directly related to the rapid development of Chiang Kai-shek's military crisis. According to the United Press, one of the reasons for the high rice prices is the rumor that the Chiang government will collect a large amount of military rice. It is said that the Jiangsu Chiang-controlled provincial government alone plans to collect 80,000 dan of military grain in Wuxi. Another reason is said to be that a large number of rice-transporting ships will be requisitioned for military use. At the same time, Wuwei and other major rice-producing areas under Chiang Kai-shek's control are now battlefields, which is also one of the reasons for stimulating rice prices. The serious situation of continuous soaring rice prices "has caused panic in the Shanghai market," making the Chiang Kai-shek authorities flustered. The Chiang government's Ministry of Food has urgently ordered the Jianghai Customs to "report all rice, wheat, and flour transported from various provinces and cities along the Yangtze River to other coastal provinces and regions for sale. It must be approved by the Ministry, otherwise, it will be regarded as smuggling." The Shanghai Chiang Kai-shek Garrison Headquarters has also ordered a ban on Shanghai grain exports. Chiang Kai-shek's special agents have been dispatched to extort money from the people, and many rice merchants have been arrested in Shanghai in recent days. However, the result is still ineffective. According to the Associated Press, "The (Chiang) municipal authorities seem powerless to stop this dizzying rise." It is believed that the rising rice prices in Shanghai will continue to develop.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, September 19th: Shanghai Ta Kung Pao reports: The cigarette industry, one of Shanghai's major industries, is on the verge of collapse due to the dumping of American cigarettes, high costs, declining sales, and difficulties in capital turnover. Currently, the cost of each case of cigarettes is 5 million yuan, but the selling price is only 4 million yuan, with an average loss rate of 20%. Many factories have closed down because they cannot maintain operations. Of the 73 large and small cigarette factories originally in the city, only 32 remained by June. Even these factories are operating at only 50% capacity. Currently, less than five factories can continue to operate every day, and most cigarette factories only operate three or four days a week. The highest production in April was more than 123,000 cases, which decreased to more than 94,000 cases in May. However, the business of the British American Tobacco Company's Shanghai Yi Zhong Cigarette Factory is developing rapidly, and it is about to restore its pre-war advantage. Before the war, the ratio of the total output of Yi Zhong and Chinese cigarette factories was seven to three. After the end of the Anti-Japanese War, it was one to ten, and now it has rebounded to three to seven. Furthermore, Shengbenji Department Store, a fairly large-scale department store in Shanghai, with a total of three branches, has also been unable to maintain operations due to huge losses. The company's average monthly gross profit from January to May this year was more than 180 million yuan, but its expenditure was more than 300 million yuan. The sluggishness of Shanghai's industry and commerce is even admitted by Gu Bingyuan, director of the Economic Administration Department of the Chiang-controlled Social Bureau: "Various industries in the city have reached a stage of decline, and although the Dragon Boat Festival has passed, the Mid-Autumn Festival will be a difficult time for industry and commerce."

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, September 19th: According to the Central News Agency Shanghai, on the 18th, the Chiang Kai-shek Central Bank again raised the benchmark price of the US dollar to 42,500 Chiang coins for one US dollar. Compared with the benchmark price of 40,500 yuan on the 12th, the Chiang currency has depreciated by about 5%. At the same time, the exchange rate of the pound sterling was also adjusted from 122,000 Chiang coins for one pound sterling to 125,000 yuan.

    蒋匪战事惨败残暴勒索军粮
    上海米价飞腾上涨
    美货充斥各业遭遇中秋难关
    【新华社陕北十七日电】综合消息：虽谓“今年各产米区的年景都很阻饶”（美联社），但上海米价仍继续猛涨，十五日每担升至六十三万元，十六日更达六十五万元，超出过去任何时期的纪录。并影响其他各种货物等尤其是行将出口的大豆、纺织品、生丝等出口货的飞涨。黑市美元也涨至数周来之最高峰四万八千五百元。上海米价暴腾，显与蒋匪军事危机之急剧发展直接有关。据合众社称：米价高涨的原因之一，系由于传出了蒋政府将征收大量军米的消息，据称仅江苏蒋记省政府即准备在无锡征收八万担军粮。另一原因据说是大批运米船只将被征充军用。同时蒋匪主要产米区之无为等地现为战场，亦为刺激米价之一原因。米价连日飞腾的严重情形“已引起上海市场的恐慌”，使得蒋匪当局手忙脚乱，蒋政府粮食部已急令江海关，“凡沿长江各省市米、麦、面粉如运出长江口外至其他沿海省区销售，一律须经该部核准，否则以私运论罪”。上海蒋家警备司令部也已下令禁止上海粮食出口。蒋匪特务纷纷出动乘机勒索人民，沪市近数日来已有许多米商被捕。但结果仍无效，据美联社称：“（蒋）市政府当局似乎无力制止这种令人头昏眼花的上涨。”咸信上海米价涨风还得继续发展。
    【新华社陕北十九日电】沪大公报讯：为上海主要工业之一的卷烟业由于美烟倾销，成本高昂，销路衰退与资金周转困难，而日陷绝境。现卷烟每箱成本须五百万元者，售价仅四百万元，平均亏蚀率达百分之二十，许多工厂因不能维持，纷纷倒闭。全市原有大小烟厂七十三家，至六月只剩三十二家，即连这些工厂其开工率亦只有百分之五十。现每天能继续开工者已不到五家，大部分烟厂每周只开工三四天。生产率最高的四月份产量为十二万三千余箱，五月份即减至九万四千箱，而英美烟草公司的上海颐中烟厂业务却日益发达，眼看就要恢复到战前的优势，战前颐中与华商各烟厂总产量的比例是七比三，抗战结束后为一与十之比，现已回升到三与七之比。又讯：沪市规模相当巨大的盛本记百货公司，共有总支店三家，近亦以亏蚀甚巨，无力维持，该公司自本年一月至五月份平均每月毛利为一亿八千余万，但支出却为三亿余元。沪市工商业之不景气，即连蒋记社会局经济行政处长顾炳元亦供认：“本市各业已至凋敝阶段，本年端节虽已渡过，中秋将为工商业之难关”。
    【新华社陕北十九日电】据中央社上海讯：十八日蒋记中央银行又将美汇基准价提高为四万二千五百元蒋币换一美元。较十二日之基准价四万零五百元，蒋币又贬值约百分之五。同时英镑汇率也由十二万二千元蒋币换一英镑调整为十二万五千元。
