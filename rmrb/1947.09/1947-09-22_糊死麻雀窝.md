    Smother the Sparrow Nests

    To the Editor:
    The autumn harvest is approaching, but sparrows are eating the grain everywhere, and their numbers are alarming, no less than locusts. We now present the damage to several plots of grain land near Weijiazhuang Village, Third District, Lucheng: Wei Yusheng (all following names are Wei), Hailong, Yuansheng, Xueke, Wenbao, Mingsai, Jubao, Jincai, Xiaotu, and nine other households have a total of fourteen and a half mu of grain land. Because of the frequent autumn rains, the crops are growing very well, and it is estimated that each mu can yield at least two and a half shi (market shi). The yellow rice is almost within reach, but it has been terribly ravaged by the sparrows through pecking and trampling. Five households (with nine and a half mu of land) did not bother to watch and fight them off. The landowners have already despairingly said, "It's all eaten up!" If this continues until the harvest, at least two-thirds will be lost, estimated at a reduction of fifteen shi and eight dou. Even for the four households who have people specifically watching the fields (five mu of land), it is estimated that production will be reduced by half, about six shi (approximately two shi, one dou, and eight sheng). Moreover, one person watches one plot of land until the harvest, requiring a half labor force for one month, totaling fifteen workdays. As a result, they still cannot prevent half of the crop from being eaten.
    Therefore, we propose a solution: call on everyone to quickly rise up and exterminate the sparrows. The sparrows all live in the cracks of the walls of houses and cave dwellings. They all return to their nests at night. Therefore, take advantage of the darkness to seal the entrances with thin mud, and you will suffocate them in their nests. This is a fundamental solution. Many cadres and ordinary people want to do this, but they worry that their own efforts will be in vain. As Wei Zihong, the technical director of Weijiazhuang, said: "This is a very good method, but if others don't do it, sparrows from other villages will fly here." We hope the leadership will pay attention to this, promote it everywhere, have every household do it, and every village engage in it, launching a "handful of mud" campaign to exterminate sparrows and protect the grain.

    糊死麻雀窝
    编辑同志：
    现在秋禾将熟，但各地又普遍发生小麻雀吃谷，数目惊人。不亚蝗虫。现仅把潞城三区魏家庄村边的几块谷地被害情形介绍如下：魏玉胜（下皆姓魏）海龙、元胜、学科、文保、明赛、聚宝、进财、小秃等九户共谷地十四亩半；因秋雨多，长的都很好，估计每亩最低能收二石五（市石）眼看黄米到口边了，可是被小麻雀连啄带蹬、糟踏惨重。内有五户顾不上去看打（九亩半地），地户已经绝望的说：“吃完啦”！这样吃到收割止，至少损失三分之二，估计减产十五石八斗。就以有人在地专门看的四户说，也要减产一半，五亩地约合六石（前后二石一斗八升）并且一块地一个人一直看到收割，共须一个月的半劳力计折工十五个，结果还不免被吃一半。
    因此我们提出一个办法：呼吁大家赶快起来灭雀。小麻雀都住在屋子的窑墙皮缝里，天一黑都要归巢，所以趁天黑时用稀泥把口糊了，就把他闷死在窑里。这是根本办法，许多干部群众都想这样干，就是怕光自己干不顶事，如魏家庄技术主任魏子洪说：“这是个顶好办法，可是别人不闹，这里除了外村又飞来了。”希望领导上注意，推动各地，户户干，村村搞，开展一把泥运动灭绝麻雀保卫粮食。
