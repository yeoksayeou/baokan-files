Some people in northern Shaanxi believe that the annihilation of the Thirty-Sixth Division by the Communist forces in the Northwest theater and the annihilation of the Seventy-Fourth Division in Shandong in May are of equal significance. In the Northwest theater, the Thirty-Sixth Division had a unique sense of pride, looking down on even Hu Zongnan's direct First Division and Ninetieth Division. In the past few months, the Northwest People's Liberation Army annihilated the Thirty-First Brigade, the One Hundred Thirty-Fifth Brigade, the One Hundred Sixty-Seventh Brigade, etc. Some prisoners at the time even said, "You can defeat us, but you can't defeat the Thirty-Sixth Division." The officers and soldiers of the Thirty-Sixth Division also boasted, "The Liberation Army can annihilate other troops, but they can't annihilate us." Therefore, the Thirty-Sixth Division became the most arrogant and狂妄main force of Chiang Kai-shek and Hu Zongnan's offensive against the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region. As such, Hu Zongnan always gave them the most important and difficult tasks.

On August 20th, in no more than seven or eight hours, the Thirty-Sixth Division was completely annihilated at Shajiadian, north of Mizhi (the Twenty-Eighth Brigade of the division stationed in Yulin was spared this time, fortunately avoiding destruction), taking about the same amount of time as the annihilation of Chiang's One Hundred Thirty-Fifth Brigade south of Wayaobao in mid-April. That morning, the division was cut into several sections by the Liberation Army and surrounded. At 1:00 PM, the Liberation Army headquarters issued the following order to the front lines: "The annihilation of the Thirty-Sixth Division is the beginning of the strategic counter-offensive in the Northwest theater and the beginning of the recovery of Yan'an and the liberation of the Great Northwest. We call on the frontline commanders and fighters to fight bravely and complete the combat task of annihilating the Thirty-Sixth Division before dusk today." This order was immediately met with heroic actions and intense artillery fire on the front lines. After two or three hours of fierce fighting, the Thirty-Sixth Division headquarters and the command posts of its One Hundred Twenty-Third and One Hundred Sixty-Fifth Brigades were captured by the People's Liberation Army. The enemy's combat organization immediately fell into chaos, and except for a few who fled in panic, the rest were annihilated. Hao Keyong, the battalion commander of the First Battalion of the Three Hundred Sixty-Seventh Regiment of the One Hundred Twenty-Third Brigade, said, "An hour before I was captured, I was still with Brigade Commander Liu (Liu Ziqi). At that time, your artillery fire was very fierce, and we had no idea what to do. After that, he disappeared." It was not until Hao was captured and reached the rear of the Liberation Army that he learned that his Brigade Commander Liu had also been captured.

During the Anti-Japanese War, the Thirty-Sixth Division was often stationed in the Luochuan area, serving as the front line for anti-communism, specifically harassing the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region. The anti-communist education in the troops was also the most thorough. Since the offensive against Yan'an in March of this year, the Thirty-Sixth Division has made continuous long-distance marches within the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region. In early June, the division marched from Yan'an and Anse to the Jingbian area, and then immediately made a forced march back to Bao'an, passing through the large forest area on the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia border, and returning to Guanzhong in late June. In early July, the division again went west from Guanzhong to eastern Gansu, then passed through the large forest again, arriving in Jingbian in early August. At this time, it suddenly received an order from Hu Zongnan to "reinforce Yulin," a total journey of more than three hundred li, to be reached in three days. Fearing annihilation by the Liberation Army on the way, the division detoured northeast from Jingbian out of the Great Wall, dragging on for three days in the desolate and uninhabited border area. Along the way, planes dropped a pitiful and rotten amount of food. The soldiers marched desperately on empty stomachs during the day and camped on the beach at night; the livestock had no fodder at all. On the evening of the third day of "reinforcement," when they were still sixty or seventy li away from Yulin, Hu Zongnan ordered them to "rush to Yulin overnight." That night, all the livestock could not move due to days of starvation, and all the supplies and ammunition were unloaded. The soldiers were forced to carry them separately, and the livestock walked empty. After dragging themselves to Yulin in this way, the soldiers were already very tired and exhausted, but they were ordered to go south to Zhenchuanpu, saying that they would "join forces with the northward-bound Nationalist troops." But when they arrived at Zhenchuanpu and advanced from Jia County, intending to join forces with the northward-bound "Nationalist troops," they were annihilated by the People's Liberation Army. Battalion Commander Hao Keyong recalled, "At that time, we saw dense ranks of you (referring to the Liberation Army) behind us and initially thought it was the troops heading north to join us."

The Thirty-Sixth Division was one of Hu Zongnan's "elite troops." After reorganization, the division had three brigades, with 33,000 men. However, this time, one division headquarters and two brigades were annihilated. Except for a few hundred who escaped, only 7,000 men remained. Yi Zhicheng, the battalion commander of the Four Hundred Ninety-Third Regiment of the One Hundred Sixty-Fifth Brigade, said that the regiment originally had more than 2,600 men, but now there are only about 1,200 men, and most of the others have deserted. When the division was annihilated, each company had a maximum of one hundred men, and a minimum of fifty or sixty men, with a common number of seventy or eighty men. The Thirty-Sixth Division was an assault force that Hu Zongnan had trained for a long time. Hu's troops often boasted, "If the Thirty-Sixth Division can't capture a position, no other troops can." However, under the iron fist of the Northwest People's Liberation Army, the Thirty-Sixth Division was also easily defeated!

Despite Chiang Kai-shek and Hu Zongnan's anti-communist education, the Thirty-Sixth Division's fighting will is not strong now. According to Yi Zhicheng, "We often hear your news and know that officers who lay down their arms are very safe, so we are not afraid at all when we come over, and the soldiers are even less afraid. We understand your policy of treating prisoners well." Hao Keyong also said, "You are with the common people, but we don't know anything about the situation. Fighting in the liberated areas, we really have no confidence." They were very dissatisfied with Hu Zongnan's commanders. Hao Keyong said, "We went through the big forest twice, and each time it took five or six days. The order was for me to go in and suppress the bandits, but there was nothing inside. Not to mention fighting, we didn't even have water to drink. Many soldiers collapsed from thirst and had to run ten or twenty li to find water and pour it on them to wake them up. The superiors (referring to Hu Zongnan) didn't understand the situation and issued orders blindly, causing the brothers to suffer unjustly. Therefore, our morale is getting worse and worse, and our confidence is getting lower and lower." (Xinhua News Agency, northern Shaanxi, 2nd)

Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 2nd: Li Gang, former brigade commander of the 167th Brigade of Chiang's army, Li Jiyun, brigade commander of the 31st Brigade, Mai Zongyu, acting brigade commander of the 135th Brigade, and 14 other officers at the rank of colonel and above, who had been liberated earlier, jointly sent a telegram to Liu Ziqi, brigade commander of the 123rd Brigade of the 36th Division of Chiang's army, and other officers and soldiers who had been captured. The original telegram roughly stated: "We heard that you have been liberated, and you may be feeling frustrated and fearful all day long, but we are deeply happy for you. Because since we came to the liberated area, we have been treated with great kindness, enjoying physical freedom and a happy life. We are no longer tools for Chiang Kai-shek to oppose the people, nor are we scavengers for American imperialism to invade China. We have been freed from the infinite shackles of our hearts and minds, and we have recognized the correct path of the Chinese nation's liberation cause. We sincerely hope that you will put aside your troubles, join hands and work together to realize our country's independence, freedom, democracy, and peace."

　　三十六师被歼经过
    陕北若干人士认为，西北战场共歼灭蒋军三十六师和五月份山东歼灭七十四师有同样意义。在西北战场蒋军中，三十六师有着独特的骄傲，他们对胡宗南嫡系的第一师和九十师都是瞧不起的。过去几个月来，西北人民解放军歼灭了三十一旅、一三五旅、一六七旅等等，当时有些俘虏也说：“你们能解决得了我们，却解决不了三十六师”。三十六师的官兵也自吹：“解放军可以歼灭别的军队，却歼灭不了我们。”所以，三十六师成为蒋介石胡宗南进攻陕甘宁边区的最骄横狂妄的主力；因此，胡宗南始终给他担任最重要最困难的任务。
    八月二十日，先后不过七、八小时，三十六师在米脂北沙家店全军覆没（该师驻榆林之二十八旅此次未来幸暂免于灭亡），与四月中旬瓦窑堡南蒋军一三五旅被歼所费的时间差不多。该日上午，该师被解放军截成数段，团团包围。下午一点钟，解放军司令部对前线发了如下的命令：“消灭三十六师是西北战场由战略防御转为战略反攻的开始，是收复延安解放大西北的开始，特号召前线指战员勇敢作战，务于本日黄昏前完成歼灭三十六师的战斗任务。”这一命令立刻为前线英勇的行动与热烈炮火所响应，经过两、三个钟头激战，三十六师师部及其一二三旅、一六五旅的指挥阵地即被人民解放军攻破，敌战斗建制立形混乱，除少数落荒而逃外，余均被歼。一二三旅三六七团一营营长郝克永说：“被俘前一点钟，我还和刘旅长（刘子奇）在一起，当时你们炮火非常猛烈，我们毫无主张，以后他即不见了。”直到郝被俘到了解放军后方，才知道他的刘旅长原来也被俘了。
    在抗日战争时期，三十六师经常驻防洛川一带，担任反共最前哨，专门对陕甘宁边区进行窜扰，部队中反共教育也最深。今年三月进攻延安以来，三十六师在陕甘宁边区内作了连续的长途来游行。六月初，该师由延安、安塞游行到靖边地区，立刻又急行军折返保安，钻过陕甘宁边界之大森林区，于六月下旬回到关中。七月初，该师又由关中西出陇东后，再钻过大森林，于八月初到了靖边，这时突然奉胡宗南命令“增援榆林”，全程三百余里限三日赶到。怕在途中被解放军歼灭，该师由靖边东北绕道出长城，在荒无人烟的塞外拖了三日，沿途田飞机投掷一点少得可怜同时又腐烂的食物，士兵饿着肚子白天拼命赶路，夜间在沙滩里宿营；牲口则根本没有草料。“增援”第三日黄昏，离榆林尚有六、七十里胡宗南又命令其“连夜赶到”。这一夜所有牲口因数日不食而拖不动了，全部辎重弹药都卸了下来。强令士兵分开背起，牲口则空着走。这样拖到榆林后，士兵们已十分疲惫困乏，但又奉令南下镇川堡，说是“与北上国军会师”。但等他们到镇川堡回葭县前进欲与北上“国军”会师时，就被人民解放军歼灭了，郝克永营长回忆说：“当时我们看到后面就上你们（指解放军）密集的队伍，开始还以为是北上与我们会师的部队呢。”
    三十六师是胡宗南“劲旅”之一，整编以后的编制全师三个旅，有三万三千人。但是这次被歼一个师部两个旅，除数百人逃走外，其余只有七千人。一六五旅四九三团营长易至诚说：该团原有二千六百多人，但现在只有一千二百人左右，其他大部逃亡了。该师被歼时，每连最多一百人，少则五、六十人，普通只有七、八十人。三十六师是胡宗南长期专门训练的攻击部队。胡军中经常自吹说：“三十六师攻不下的阵地其他部队也没有办法。”然而在西北人民解放军的铁拳下，三十六师也不堪一击啊！
    尽管蒋介石、胡宗南的反共教育，三十六师的战斗意志现在并不强，据易至诚说：“我们常听你们的消息，知道以前放下武器的军官很安全，因此我们过来时一点不怕，士兵更是不怕，你们优待俘虏的政策我们是了解的。”郝克永也说：“你们和老百姓一起，我们则情况一点不晓得，在解放区里打仗，我们实在没有把握。”他们对胡宗南的指挥官非常不满，郝克永就说：“我们钻过两次大森林，一进去就是五六天，命令是要我进去清剿，可是到了里面什么鬼也没有，自己不用说打仗，连水都没得喝，许多士兵因干渴倒下了，还得跑一、二十里找水回来灌醒他们，上面（指胡宗南）情况不了解，闭着眼睛下命令，害得弟兄们吃冤枉苦头，因此我们的士气是越来越不行，信心越来越差了。”（新华社陕北二日电）
    【新华社西北二日电】前经解放之蒋军一六七旅旅长李＠岗、卅一旅旅长李纪云、一三五旅代旅长麦宗禹等将校级军官十七人，联名致电被俘之蒋军卅六师一二三旅旅长刘子奇以下官兵。原电略称：“闻兄等被解放，在兄等或懊丧莫名，恐惧终日，但弟等都却深为兄等庆幸。因弟等来解放区后，倍受优待，身体自由，生活愉快，既不做蒋介石反人民的工具，也不做美帝国主义侵略中国的清道夫，解除了内心与精神上的无限桎梏，认识了中华民族解放事业的正确道路。甚愿兄等摈除烦恼，携手共进，为实现我国的独立自由民主和平而奋斗。
