　　Village Office and Cooperative Combined
　　Yang'an Tries New Leadership Method
　　[Report from our Taiyue Office on the 5th] Yang'an Village, Qin County, has created a new leadership method combining the cooperative and the village office. First, the cooperative and the village office are combined, with the production director concurrently serving as manager, the finance and grain officer as accountant, the secretary as bookkeeper, the village chief managing the oil mill, and the village police running errands outside. All eight mutual aid teams in the village are also directly led by the cooperative, with cooperative staff participating in labor in each team. The subsidies and expenses for the two schools in the village are provided by the cooperative. Teachers use extracurricular time to organize cooperative members to educate out-of-school children and mutual aid team members from nearby small villages to read newspapers and learn to read and write, achieving a planned and organized coordination of various tasks of the village office, cooperative, mutual aid teams, and schools. Secondly, village cadres lead all kinds of work in the village through the cooperative, enabling the cooperative to systematically coordinate with the central tasks of each period. When it came to conscription work in February of this year, Duan Quanze, the manager of the cooperative, led seven staff members to join the army, influencing forty-five young people in the village to collectively enlist. During the spring plowing, the cooperative organized a shock spring plowing team, with the manager and deputy manager each leading a group to help military families sow 128 mu of land. Also, due to disputes over the use of farm tools among the teams at that time, disunity arose. The cooperative then solved the problem of farm tool difficulties for them, distributing eight manure buckets, twenty-seven carrying poles, and one plow and one harrow to each team. During the slack season, the cooperative organized a large transportation effort, earning 298,500 yuan. In weaving, the cooperative also provided flower loans to the teams through the village and sent people to Wuyuan, Tunliu, to exchange flowers for cloth for the women. During the land measurement and assessment, seven members of the cooperative participated in the measurement and assessment. Staff members within the cooperative proposed that one person should be as productive as two people, so that neither the measurement and assessment nor the cooperative's own work was delayed. Due to the implementation of this new leadership method, the cooperative itself is also expanding day by day. On June 15th, after summarizing half a year's work and distributing dividends, the number of members increased from 476 to 582, and the fund increased from the original 995,400 yuan to 2,700,000 yuan. After deducting equipment expenses and 28% dividends, the net profit was 796,300 yuan. In the future, they will continue to implement the combination of cooperative and mutual aid teams to lead the masses in agricultural and sideline production.

　　村公所和合作社结合
  　杨安试行新领导方法
    【本报太岳五日电】沁县杨安村，创造合作社与村公所结合的新领导方法。首先合作社与村公所结合上，由生产主任兼经理，财粮兼会计，书记兼算帐、村长搞油坊，村警跑外头。全村八个互助组，亦由合作社直接领导，合作社职员参加到各组去劳动，村里两个学校的津贴花费，都由合作社供给，教员抽课外时间，组织合作社的人到附近小庄教育校外儿童与互助组成人读报认字，作到了村公所、合作社、互助组、学校各种工作有计划有组织的配合进行。其次，村干部通过合作社领导全村各种工作，使合作社有计划的配合每个时期中心工作进行。今年二月，要参军工作时，合作社经理段全则带领七个职员参军，影响了全村四十五个青年集体参军。春耕时，合作社组织了个突击春耕大队，由正副经理各带一组，帮助军属下种一百二十八亩。又因当时各组争用农具，引起不团结。合作社遂为他们解决农具困难，给各组分粪桶八担，挑头二十七付，耧犁各一张。农闲季节。合作社就组织大运输一次，赚洋二十九万八千五百元。纺织上亦由合作社给组联村贷花，及派人到屯留吾元给妇女用花换布。在丈评地亩时，合作社七人参加丈评，合作社内职员提出一人顶二人，使丈评与合作社本身工作均未耽误。由于实行了这个新的领导方法，合作社本身也在日益扩大，在六月十五日，总结半年工作分红后，社员由四七六增加到五八二人，基金由原来九十九万五千四百元增加到二七○万元，除花费设备费及二八分红外，净赚洋七十九万六千三百元，今后他们要继续贯澈合作社与互助组结合，领导群众农副业生产。
