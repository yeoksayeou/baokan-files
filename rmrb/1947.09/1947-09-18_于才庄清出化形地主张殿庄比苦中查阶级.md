　　[Report from this newspaper's Ji-Lu-Yu Office on the 16th] During the joint review by six villages including Yu Caizhuang in the Third District of Zhuxian, the metamorphosed landlord Wang Yuanting was exposed and handed over to the masses for public trial. Landlord Wang Yuanting of Yu Caizhuang used to oppress and exploit the poor. Du Gongyu Tingxiang was stabbed by Yu Yuanting with a knife for asking for his wages. Later, due to his extravagant eating and drinking, his family situation declined, but he was still wealthier than the average masses. After the change, he burrowed into the anti-Japanese camp and worked in the judicial department of the Dong'a Democratic Government, again abusing his power for personal gain, arbitrarily assigning cattle and carts to pull things and do business for himself. Later, he was transferred to work in Chaocheng, where he continued to be corrupt and extort, and was fired. After returning home, he still suppressed the masses by claiming that he had worked and that he was a family member of a martyr (his daughter worked elsewhere). His wife also burrowed into the women's association as director, acting like a tyrant. During the land reform, he shielded landlords, kept over 30 mu of wheat seedling land for himself, and wanted two cows. He took one-third of the assets from the struggle. During the initial review, only a millstone was more valuable. Wang Yuanting's wife took a fancy to it and said, "Don't divide this millstone, let me keep it." He often said, "Don't look at how much I want, my whole family is resisting Japan." No one dared to offend him. During this joint review by six villages, Wang Yuanting's wife wanted to be a review committee member because she was the director of the women's association. Director Ma of the joint association mobilized the masses and supported them, and the masses dared to speak out about Wang Yuanting's past sins. It has now been decided to hold a mass meeting for the masses to settle accounts.
　　[Report from this newspaper's Ji-Lu-Yu Office on the 16th] The masses in Zhang Dianzhuang in the Sixth District of Qiyu investigated class status by comparing suffering. After the masses' complaint meeting in the village, they were divided into groups to assess class status, allowing middle peasants, poor peasants, and extremely poor peasants to stand in three groups. However, some masses suggested that this was unfair. After discussion, everyone agreed that they should compare suffering and life history to assess class status. At that time, Zhang Yuting stood up and said, "My family of five has two mu of land. We went to Guandong to work as laborers and begged for food. We still don't have a house and still live in someone else's house." After he finished speaking, Jia Changxing compared himself to him and said, "I have been working as a laborer for three generations. I have been working as a laborer until now, over forty years old, and I only have five mu of land. My mother has never eaten pure grain, and she has eaten all kinds of chaff and vegetables. We have never eaten wheat during the New Year. I don't even have a wife. You only talk about being poor and suffering, but you used to have twenty or thirty mu of land, and you spent it all on eating and drinking. You have a wife, and you also have children. You are much better than me." Later, after evaluation by the masses, Zhang Yuting was a bankrupt landlord, and Jia Changxing was extremely poor. After comparing suffering, some were changed from poor peasants to extremely poor, and some were changed from extremely poor to middle peasants, and sixteen households of landlords and rich peasants were found.

　　于才庄清出化形地主张殿庄比苦中查阶级
    【本报冀鲁豫十六日电】筑先三区于才庄等六个村联合复查时，清出化形地主王元廷，交群众公审。于才庄地主王元廷，过去压迫剥削穷人，都工于廷香因为向他要工钱，曾被于元廷用刀子刺伤。后来由于他大吃二喝，家境下降，但仍较一般群众的生活富裕。改变后，钻进抗日阵营，在东阿民主政府作司法工作，又假公济私，随便派牛派车给自己拉东西、做生意。后来调到朝城工作，仍是贪污勒索，被开除。回家后，仍以自己做过工作，及抗属名义（女儿在外工作）压制群众，他老婆也钻进妇会当主任，称王称霸。土改时包庇地主，斗出三十多亩麦苗地都自己留下，并要两条牛，斗争的资财被他占了三分之一。这次开始复查时，只一盘水磨比较值钱，王元廷老婆看中了，说：“这盘水磨别分啦，我留下吧。”他常说：“你别看俺要的东西多，俺全家抗战哩。”群众谁也不敢惹他。这次六个村联合复查时，王元廷老婆以自己是妇会主任，要当复查委员。联合会马主任发动群众，撑腰作主，群众才大胆说出王元廷过去的罪恶，现决定开大会由群众清算。
    【本报冀鲁豫十六日电】齐禹六区张殿庄群众由比苦中查阶级。该村群众诉苦大会后，分组评阶级，让中农、贫农、赤贫分三伙站队；但有的群众提出这样不公平。经大家讨论，一致意见是要比苦，比生活历史，来评阶级。当时张玉亭站起来说：“我家五口人，二亩地，到过关外扛活，要过饭，至今没有宅子，还住别人的房子。”他说完后，贾长兴便和他比起来说：“我三辈子扛活，我扛活到现在四十多岁了，才要了五亩地。母亲没吃过净粮食，什么样的糠菜也吃过。过年没吃过麦子。我连个媳妇也没有。你光说穷受苦，你从前二卅亩地，都让你吃喝花了，你有媳妇，也有儿女，你比我强多了。”后来由群众评议，张玉亭是破落地主，贾长兴是赤贫。经过比苦后，有由贫农划到赤贫的，也有由赤贫划到中农的，并查出地主富农十六户。
