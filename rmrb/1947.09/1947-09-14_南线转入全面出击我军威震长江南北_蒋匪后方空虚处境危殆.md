Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 12th. The nationwide counter-offensive of the People's Liberation Army has now begun. The military and political situation in China has thus entered a new stage. This is the result of the PLA implementing a full-scale offensive on the southern front. Following the strategic counter-offensives launched by the PLA in the Northeast, Rehe, Eastern Hebei, the northern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, Zhengtai, Southern Shanxi, and Northern Henan, the southern front has launched a full-scale offensive as the overall civil war in China enters its second year. The PLA's southern front offensive, to date, includes the following main components:
	(1) The Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Field Army under Generals Liu Bocheng, Deng Xiaoping, Xu Xiangqian, and Li Xiannian, has moved south across the Yellow River, Longhai Railway, and Huai River, and has advanced to the Dabie Mountains area of Southeastern Henan, Eastern Hubei, and Western Anhui. This army crossed the Yellow River in western Shandong on June 30th. In July, it annihilated nine and a half brigades of Chiang's army in southwestern Shandong. On August 7th, it marched south. On the 11th, it crossed the Longhai Railway, successively recovering and liberating Ningling, Suixian, Zhecheng, Boxian, Huaiyang, Shenqiu, Xincai, Xiangcheng, Shangcai, Linquan, and Xixian cities. In the latter half of the same month, it crossed the Huai River, and successively recovered and liberated Gushi, Guangshan, Jingfu, Huangchuan, Macheng, Lihuang, Liuan, Luotian, Huoshan, and Shucheng cities and many towns and vast rural areas.
	(2) The Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Field Army under Generals Chen Geng, Xie Fuzhi, Han Jun, Qin Jiwei, and Kong Congzhou, has moved south across the Yellow River and Longhai Railway and has advanced to the western Henan area. After liberating southwestern Shanxi from early April to early June, this army withdrew to the Taiyue area for rest and preparation. On August 23rd, it crossed the Yellow River near Yuanqu in southern Shanxi, successively liberating Xinan, Mianchi, Yiyang, Luoning, Songxian, and many towns and vast rural areas.
	(3) The East China Field Army under Generals Chen Yi, Su Yu, Chen Shiqu, Tang Liang, and Ye Fei, has moved west across the Tianjin-Pukou Railway and the Grand Canal, and has followed the Liu-Deng army in advancing to the southwestern Shandong area. After attacking the pseudo-Wu Huawen army in the Chengwuxian area in late August, this army annihilated the entire 57th Division of the enemy, under the command of Duan Linmao, at Shatuji, east of Heze and south of Yuncheng, on the 8th of this month.
	(4) The Northwest Field Army under Generals Peng Dehuai, He Long, Xi Zhongxun, and Wang Shitai, has launched a counter-offensive from northern Shaanxi. This army annihilated one enemy brigade on the outskirts of Yulin in early August, then moved south, annihilating the enemy's 36th Division under Zhong Song in the Shajiadian area north of Mizhi on the 20th of the same month. In the latter half of the same month it advanced rapidly southwards, and has now reached the Yanchuan-Yongping line. The enemy forces under Liu Kan and Dong Zhao are lagging behind, still near Qingjian, exhausted and panicked, fearing us like tigers.
In addition, in northern Jiangsu, in the Henan-Anhui-Jiangsu border area, in northern Henan, and in southern Shanxi, the People's Liberation Army is also actively launching offensives. The Northern Jiangsu Liberation Army also annihilated the entire 1st Division of the pseudo-42nd Army Group on August 12th, recovering Yeting City (Yancheng).
Thus, at the beginning of the second year of the civil war, the entire southern front situation, from northern Jiangsu in the east to Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia in the west, has fundamentally changed. Like the northern front, it has shifted to an increasingly large-scale counter-offensive.
Since the outbreak of the nationwide civil war in July of last year, the focus of Chiang's army's offensive has always been on the southern front. In July of last year, Chiang's regular army used 31 brigades in the Jiangsu-Anhui border area, 25 brigades in the Central Plains Liberated Area, 37 brigades in Shandong (excluding southwestern Shandong), 28 brigades in Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan (including southwestern Shandong and southern Shanxi), and 19 brigades in Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia, a total of 130 brigades, accounting for more than two-thirds of the total strength of Chiang's army attacking the liberated areas, which numbered 193 brigades.
Since then, although Chiang's army has suffered repeated heavy blows, with more than 67 regular army brigades at or above battalion level being annihilated in the first year of the civil war alone (including 39 entire brigades and 9 division headquarters), Chiang's army has continued to increase and replenish its forces, maintaining more than 150 brigades from January to August this year, accounting for more than 70% of its total strength attacking the liberated areas. Among them, those attacking the East China Liberated Area (eastern Shandong Tianjin-Pukou Railway and northern Jiangsu) reached more than 80 brigades, and those attacking the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region reached more than 30 brigades. Therefore, the southern battlefront has become the two battlefields with the most concentrated Chiang army forces in the country.
After the Central Plains People's Liberation Army under General Li Xiannian successfully completed the strategic task of containing Chiang's army and successfully withdrew to the Jiangsu-Anhui border area, the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia border area, and the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan border area, Chiang Kai-shek has been attempting to use a so-called key offensive to force the two wings of the southern front's Liberation Army across the Yellow River, but Chiang Kai-shek has never been able to realize his ambition. After the full-scale counter-offensive of the Liberation Army on the southern front, this attempt has been shattered.
The beginning of the second year of the war has pushed the front line on a huge scale to the place where the first year of the war began - the Yangtze River basin - and quickly turned important cities such as Xinyang, Wuhan, Anqing, Hefei, Luoyang, and Xi'an in the rear of Chiang's army into threatened front lines.
The large-scale offensive by the Liberation Army on the southern front has proven to be completely beyond the expectations of the arrogant Chiang Kai-shek and his various command departments and American advisors. They foolishly interpreted Liu Bocheng's army's actions as a so-called "failed attempt to cross north, so they fled south," as an attempt to "flee west across the Ping-Han Railway," saying that Chen Geng's army went south to "meet Liu Bocheng," and that only "pacification operations" remained in Shandong, and that "the communist bandits in northern Shaanxi have been wiped out." All a bunch of nonsense, actually a panicked mess, flustered and at a loss.
Under these circumstances, they were first forced to transfer more than a dozen brigades from the east of the Shandong Tianjin-Pukou Railway, three or four brigades from Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia, and more than a dozen brigades from the Henan and southern Shanxi and Yangtze River defense forces, in an attempt to block the Liberation Army's rapid advance into the Central Plains and the Yangtze River. However, the vast majority of them fell behind the Liberation Army.
Chiang's army, which was deeply trapped in Jiaxian and Mizhi areas in northern Shaanxi, only realized that they were in a dangerous situation when they discovered that the Northwest Liberation Army was attacking them from the south. Chiang's army, which is deeply trapped in the east of the Shandong Tianjin-Pukou Railway, is still blindly taking risks in the coastal areas of Jiaodong (north of Jiaoji Railway) and Binhai (south of Jiaoji Railway) even now.
According to military reports, the Liberation Army's southbound forces are mighty, entering undefended areas, and gaining a large amount of booty at a very small cost from the weak enemies scattered in various places. They have been warmly welcomed by the masses in various urban and rural areas because they have driven out the various local "Little Chiang Kai-sheks" who dominated one side. The people, who have been in the dark hell of Chiang's army, Chiang's government, and Chiang's party for a long time, universally praise the well-disciplined Liberation Army as their "savior."

　　南线转入全面出击我军威震长江南北
  　蒋匪后方空虚处境危殆
    【新华社陕北十二日电】人民解放军的全国性反攻今已开始，中国军事政治形势从此进到一个新的阶段，这是解放军在南线实行全线出击的结果。紧接着东北、热河、冀东、津浦北段、正太、晋南、豫北等地解放军举行战略性反攻之后，正当中国的全面内战进入第二年的时候，南线开始了全线出击。解放军的南线出击至目前为止，包含以下几个主要部分：（一）刘伯承、邓小平、徐向前、李先念诸将军所部晋冀鲁豫野战军，南出黄河、陇海路、淮河，已进至豫东南、鄂东、皖西的大别山地区。该军系于六月三十日在山东西部渡过黄河。七月在鲁西南连歼蒋军九个半旅，八月七日向南进军。十一日越过陇海路，先后收复与解放宁陵、睢县、柘城、亳县、淮阳、沈邱、新蔡、项城、上蔡、临泉、息县等城。同月下旬渡过淮河，又先后收复与解放固始、光山、经扶、潢川、商城、麻城、立煌、六安、罗田、霍山、舒城等城及许多市镇和广大乡村。（二）陈赓、谢富治、韩钧、秦基伟、孔从周诸将军所部晋冀鲁豫野战军，南出黄河、陇海路，已进至豫西地区。该军在四月初至六月初解放晋西南以后，即撤回太岳地区休整准备。于八月二十三日起在晋南垣曲附近南渡黄河，先后解放新安、渑池、宜阳、洛宁、嵩县及许多市镇和广大乡村。（三）陈毅、粟裕、陈士渠、唐亮、叶飞诸将军所部华东野战军，西出津浦路、运河，已继刘邓部进至鲁西南地区。该军于八月下旬在城武地区打击了伪吴化文部以后，于本月八日在菏泽以东、郓城以南之沙土集歼敌整五十七师段霖茂全部。（四）彭德怀、贺龙、习仲勋、王世泰诸将军所部西北野战军，由陕北反攻。该军于八月初旬在榆林外围歼敌一个旅，然后南下，于同月廿日在米脂以北沙家店地区歼敌整三十六师钟松部，又于同月下旬向南急进，现已达延川永坪之线，而刘戡、董钊等部敌军则落在后面，尚在清涧附近，肌疲恐慌，畏我如虎。此外，在苏北，在豫皖苏边区，在豫北，在晋南，人民解放军亦积极出击。苏北解放军并于八月十二日歼灭了伪四十二集团军第一师全部，收复叶挺城（盐城）。由此，在内战第二年的开始，东起苏北、西起陕甘宁的整个南线形势已经根本改变。与北线同样转入日益扩大的反攻。从去年七月全国内战爆发以来，蒋军进攻的重点始终是在南线，去年七月间蒋军正规军使用于南线者计为苏皖边区三十一个旅，中原解放区二十五个旅，山东（不包括鲁西南）三十七个旅，晋冀鲁豫（包括鲁西南和晋西南）廿八个旅，陕甘宁十九个旅，共一百三十个旅，占当时蒋军进攻解放区总兵力一百九十三个旅的三分之二以上。此后，南线蒋军虽连遭痛击，在内战第一年内，仅营以上正规军即被歼六十七个旅以上（内卅九个整旅、外九个师部），但蒋军仍继续增加和补充兵力，在今年一月至八月期间，始终保持一百五十几个旅，占其进攻解放区总兵力百分之七十以上。其中进攻华东解放区（山东津浦路东和苏北）者曾达八十几个旅，进攻陕甘宁边区者则达卅几个旅。因此南线的两冀成为全国蒋军兵力最集中的两个战场。在李先念将军所部中原人民解放军胜利完成牵制蒋军的战略任务，并分别胜利撤往苏皖边区、陕甘宁边区、晋冀鲁豫边区以后，蒋介石就一直企图用所谓重点攻势，把南线解放军的两翼逼过黄河，但是蒋介石一直没有能实现他的企图。在南线解放军全线反攻以后，这个企图已被粉碎。战争第二年的开始，已把战线以巨大规模推到战争第一年开始的地方——长江流域，并使蒋军后方的信阳、武汉、安庆、合肥、洛阳、西安等重要城市，迅速变为受威胁的前线。南线解放军的大举出击，已证明完全出于骄傲的蒋介石及其各指挥部和美国顾问的意料之外。他们愚蠢地解释刘伯承军的行动是所谓“北渡不成而南窜”，是企图“越平汉路西窜”，说陈赓军南下为“接应刘伯承”，又说山东只剩下了“绥靖作战”，“陕北共匪业已肃清”，一派胡言乱语，实则慌做一堆，仓惶失措。在这种情况下，首先被迫由山东津浦路以东调出十几个旅，由陕甘宁调出三四个旅，另由豫北、晋南和长江守备部队中调出十几个旅，试图拦阻向中原和长江疾进的解放军。但是绝大部分都落在解放军之后。深陷陕北葭县、米脂地区的蒋军，在发觉西北解放军已由南面向他们攻击的时候，才知道自己是处于危险的境地。深陷山东津浦路以东的蒋军，甚至直到现在还在向胶东（胶济路北）、滨海（胶济路南）沿海地区作盲目的冒险。据军方报告，各路南下解放军，浩浩荡荡，乘虚直入，如入无人之境。他们从分散各地的薄弱敌人手中，得到代价极小的大量俘获。他们由于为人民驱除了称霸一方的各个地方性的“小蒋介石”，而受到各地城乡群众的热烈欢迎。久处蒋军蒋政蒋党黑暗地狱中的人民，普遍称颂纪律严明的解放军为自己的“救星”。（附图片）
