　　Discussion on "Labor Shares in Land Evaluation"
　　Deng Ping
　　The "New Method of Labor Shares in Land Evaluation and Mutual Aid" was reported by the People's Daily reporter group on August 14th regarding Donggou Village in Shahe. The content and specific method are: "After democratic evaluation, based on each person's land conditions such as distance and quality, the required labor is determined. The land owner issues the same number of work points, which are kept by the team leader as each person's expenditure. Then, through democratic evaluation, based on each person's and livestock's labor strength and skill level, the work points earned per day are determined. It is also stated that good labor can earn extra points. After a day's work, the team leader pays the corresponding work points. Finally, based on the number of work points in hand, those with more contribute to those with less. This is each person's income." "According to this method, efficiency is increased by one-half compared to individual labor." Because it is a new situation and a new phenomenon, it has also attracted my curious attention. I have repeatedly studied this news item many times and have the following understandings, which I present for research:

　　First, regarding the method itself, I personally believe that the method itself is relatively scientific because it is a combination of "piece-rate work" (evaluating according to different land and crops) and "time-rate work" (calculating work based on different labor and a certain amount of time). It is a further development of the simple, primitive "labor exchange" and "piece-rate work." Because it is a product close to scientific principles, its implementation can indeed play a significant role, especially in villages with a good foundation in production work. It can leverage everyone's production enthusiasm and creativity under different conditions, avoiding generalization problems. It can improve labor efficiency and labor skills, because more work earns more points, and less work earns fewer points, making those with strong labor and skilled techniques even stronger and more skilled, while those with weak labor and insufficient skills also have the confidence to catch up. It also facilitates the summarizing of experience, the timely discovery of labor experts and activists, and the timely settlement of wage procedures, avoiding some disputes arising from wage issues. These are all good aspects and successful aspects of this method. But on the other hand, there are also aspects worth studying:

　　According to the reporter's report, the basic contradiction that has existed in Donggou Village for the past three or four years is the three issues of scientific life arrangement, equivalent exchange, and voluntary combination. Because these three most fundamental issues have not been resolved or have not been resolved well, things have been very unsatisfactory for several years. It collapses and is reorganized, and after organization, it is about to collapse again, hindering the further development and improvement of production mutual aid. These factual difficulties undoubtedly must be resolved through thorough, comprehensive, and systematic democratic discussion and research. Facts have also proven that these three major principles are closely linked and indispensable. Judging from the situation reported by the reporter, it seems that the problems that already existed in Donggou Village have disappeared after the implementation of the "Labor Shares in Land Evaluation" method, and that no problems will occur in the future. The conclusions reported, such as "the long-unresolved weeding disputes have also been easily resolved," "can maximize the production enthusiasm of team members," and "can always clarify the benefits of mutual aid and are easy to consolidate," illustrate this point. In fact, the implementation of the "Labor Shares in Land Evaluation" method can only solve the problems of "equivalent exchange" and "work calculation." As for the "life arrangement" issues on "years of weeding disputes" and "weeding sooner or later," and the "voluntary combination" issue, they need to be resolved by other methods, not by this method alone. Moreover, in fact, even if the "equivalent exchange" (which is also very important) problem is solved well, without solving the particularly important "scientific life arrangement" and "democratic voluntary combination" problems, even if the equivalent exchange and work calculation are done well (relatively speaking), and the production enthusiasm of the team members is temporarily boosted, and the production enthusiasm of the team members is improved to a certain extent within a certain time limit, it cannot be said that all problems have been solved. The solution to all problems depends on whether the overall life arrangement is scientific and whether the combination is democratic and voluntary. Here, I do not deny the many gains of Donggou Village after the implementation of the "Labor Shares in Land Evaluation" method, but only raise it for research!

　　Secondly, the reporter's report is only limited to the situation during the summer weeding period. From this, it can be seen that there is no such method during the spring plowing and sowing period. How can we solve the "life arrangement" problem and the "democratic voluntary combination" problem in different periods along with this method, and further formulate different wages for different periods? Then this method will not only be applicable to the summer weeding period, but can also be applied to any farming season. However, the reporter pointed out: "In the weeding time alone, 286 workdays are saved," "Efficiency is actually increased by one-half compared to individual labor." There are two issues to be raised for research: First, how many households are there in Donggou Village? How much population and land? How much full labor and livestock labor? The reporter's report is unclear. Second, generally speaking, each mu of mountainous land requires an average of about 10 to 11.5 workdays of human and animal power per year (including embankment reinforcement, edge repair, fertilizer delivery, spring plowing and sowing, summer weeding, harvesting...etc. the entire process), while each mu of flat land requires an average of about 6.5 to 9 workdays of human and animal power per year. If we take a small village of 50 households, more than 300 mu of land, and about 100 laborers as the minimum, saving more than 200 workdays per season cannot really be regarded as improving labor efficiency by one-half. In fact, how much labor efficiency is improved cannot be accurately calculated based on the labor results of one period alone. Take weeding itself as an example! The first weeding requires more work due to intensive cultivation (of course, labor will also be saved), while the second and third weeding save even more labor because of the foundation laid by the first weeding. If we draw conclusions based on the results of the second and third weeding, then it will not be very accurate. Therefore, it must be calculated based on the entire labor process throughout the year.

　　Thirdly, regarding the issue of cultivating land for military families, from the reporter's report that "military family land is also evaluated, and the entire team contributes work points, and finally, according to each person's land and labor burden," there is also a need for research. Because military families include well-off rich peasant households, relatively good middle peasant households, and not-so-good poor tenant farmer households, the cultivation should be determined according to these actual situations, and should not be borne by everyone in a general way, especially not by the team alone. According to the experience of many places, the following cultivation method is generally adopted: Based on the standard of 10 points per workday, the rich peasant households of military families contribute work points at 6/10 or 4/10, the middle peasant households contribute work points at 4/10 or 2/10, and the poor peasants or tenant farmers can be exempt from contributing work points, with completely voluntary cultivation. As for the remaining work points that are less than 10 points, they are all borne by the entire village according to the amount of land and population. The work points that should be paid by the poor tenant farmers are also borne by the entire village. Those who participate in cultivation, regardless of who they are cultivating for, can receive the full wage for the day. The implementation of this cultivation method has the following advantages: It does not let everyone suffer losses, nor does it let the team suffer losses, nor does it let individuals suffer losses. I personally believe that the true meaning of preferential treatment for military families lies here. This method can be used for reference.

　　Finally, based on the above aspects, I would like to raise the following questions for research:

　　I. The issue of scientific life arrangement—that is, the adaptation of collective labor to natural conditions:

　　Rushing to plant, rushing to weed, and rushing to harvest are the three most tense links in the annual agricultural life, and they are the concentrated expression of different lives in different seasons. It is also at this time that collective labor often conflicts with individual interests, and it is an emergency moment when things are most complicated and problems are most likely to occur. If this natural condition conflicts with collective labor at this time, then the organizational form of collective labor will be broken and decomposed. Many places have successively proved this point, and the lessons of Donggou Village over the years especially prove this point. According to the experience of various places, in order to avoid the occurrence of problems, it is necessary to democratically discuss and scientifically and carefully arrange the order of life according to natural conditions. For example, when sowing, the order of sowing should be based on whether the land is drought-resistant, far or near, and whether it is exposed to wind. When weeding, determine the order based on the size and density of the seedlings. When harvesting, determine the urgency based on whether the crops are ripe and whether they are exposed to wind. Mountainous land, aquatic land, mountain ditch land, flat land, flat slope land, and river beach sandy land are also closely related to the above arrangements.

　　II. The issue of labor division and cooperation—that is, leveraging collective labor to improve production efficiency and production technology:

　　Appropriately arranging life and allocating labor based on the strength and skill level of labor is an effective way to leverage collective labor and improve production efficiency and production technology. According to the experience of various places, places that save the most labor and have done well in agriculture and sideline industries mostly use this method (of course, not blindly copying it). The specific method is: through democratic discussion, allocate labor according to the needs of agricultural life. For example, organize more labor for those with concentrated land, and organize less labor for those with dispersed land. Due to the dispersion of land in mountainous areas, it is advisable to disperse labor, while in flat areas with concentrated land, it is advisable to concentrate labor; this should be the case for spring plowing, sowing, weeding, and harvesting. In addition, different skilled labor should be allocated according to different agricultural lives, such as those who plow the land specialize in plowing the land, those who harrow the land specialize in harrowing the land, those who deliver fertilizer specialize in delivering fertilizer, and those who plant seeds specialize in planting seeds. This flexible use of labor, organization of labor, and division of labor and cooperation can not only leverage the strengths of one person, but also save more labor for sideline activities.

　　III. The issue of democratic and voluntary combination: Because today it is basically collective labor based on an individual economic foundation, the combination must be completely voluntary and the leadership of the team must be democratic, otherwise it will inevitably fail. Regarding this, various places have gained experience, and Donggou Village has also gained experience. Here I only raise a few questions for research: First, people or households with similar land, similar habits, and compatible feelings should be combined with each other, because this is relatively easy to combine and easy to consolidate. Second, people or households who do not want to participate in the mutual aid group should be allowed not to participate, and on the other hand, use examples of actual benefits to influence and promote them, so that they can solve and correct the errors in their own views from within their own minds. Third, encourage more and criticize less, and promote the ideological consciousness of certain people from the aspect of encouragement, so that they can transform themselves. Fourth, it is necessary to take care of the individual interests of each specific team member (such as weddings and funerals, visiting relatives (necessary), sending guests, and other trivial household affairs, etc.), so that they feel that the mutual aid group has freedom and does not feel any distress of unfreedom. Fifth, during rest or work time (in general), absolutely avoid meeting forms that are sufficient to hinder the interests of the masses. All problems should be resolved as much as possible while working; at the same time, democratically discuss and stipulate some (absolutely not too many) meeting forms and systems that are readily accepted and implemented by everyone. Sixth, model figures and activists who emerge during different periods should be promptly rewarded and commended, and used as the direction of action for a certain period.

### 关于“劳力入股土地评分”之商榷

　　关于“劳力入股土地评分”之商榷
    邓平
    “劳力入股土地评分互助新办法”是八月十四日人民日报记者团对沙河东沟村的报导，内容和具体办法是“经过民主评议，按照每个人土地远近好坏等条件，确定需工多少，由地的主人出同数的工票，交组长保存，作为每个人的支出。再经民主评议，按照每个人及牲口的劳动强弱，技术高低，确定作一天顶工多少；并说明劳动得好，可以加分，劳动一天，组长即付给应得工票，最后视手中工票多少，长入短出，这是每个人的收入”。“按此方法，实较个体劳动提高效率二分之一”。因为是新情况，新事物的出现，也引起了我好奇眼光的注视，我曾把这篇新闻反复的研究了许多次，有如下认识，特提出供研究：
    首先谈到办法的本身，我个人认为这种办法的本身是比较科学的，因为它是“以活计工”（根据不同的土地及农作物评分），和“以时计工”（根据不同的劳力和一定的时间计工），两个办法的总和，是单纯的原始的“以工换工”“按活计工”的进一步发展，由于它是近乎科学的产物，实行起来，确乎能发挥不少的作用，尤其是在素有生产工作基础的村庄，如能使在不同的条件下，发挥大家的生产积极性与创造性，避免了一般化的毛病。能提高劳动效率和劳动技术，因为多做能多顶分，少做能少顶分，使得劳力强而技术熟练者更强更精，而劳力弱技术不够熟练者亦有信心迎头赶上。同时也便于总结经验，随时发现劳动中的能手和积极分子，也便于及时清理工资手续，避免因工资问题而产生的一些纠纷。这些都是好的，是本办法成功的方面。但另一方面，却也有值得研究之处：
    根据记者同志的报导，东沟村近三四年来一直存在着的基本矛盾，是科学的生活安排，等价交换和自愿结合的三个问题，因为这三个最根本的问题没有获得解决或者解决的不甚好，所以几年来搞得非常不如意，垮了又重新组织，组织起来又要垮，阻碍了生产互助的进一步发展与提高。这些事实上的困难，无疑问的必须经过民主的彻底的周密系统的讨论研究后，方能获得解决；事实也证明，这三大原则问题是紧密结合着的，缺一不可。据记者同志所报导的情况来看，好象是东沟村自实行“劳力入股土地评分”办法后，已经存在着的问题没有了，以后不会发生什么问题；从报导的几点结论来看，如“多年来未解决的锄苗纠纷，也迎刃而解，”“能提高组员最大的生产积极性，”“能随时明确互助的好处，容易巩固”等，即是说明这点。事实上，“劳力入股土地评分”办法之实行，只能解决“等价交换”和“计工”问题，至于“几年来的锄苗纠纷”“先锄后锄”上的“生活安排”问题，和“自愿结合”问题，就需要用旁的办法来解决，而不是这个办法所能完全解决的问题了。而且事实上光解决了“等价交换”（这也是很重要的）问题，而没有解决尤其重要的“生活科学安排”和“民主自愿结合”两个问题，纵然因等价交换和计工问题搞的好（也是相对的），而一时鼓舞了组员们的生产情绪，在一定时间一定限度上提高了组员们的生产积极性，然而这还不能说是已解决了一切问题，而一切问题的解决却要看全盘生活安排得是否科学以及结合得是否民主自愿两个问题而定了。在这里我并不否认东沟村实行“劳力入股土地评分”办法后的许多收获，而仅是提出来研究罢了！
    其次，记者同志的报导，仅只是限于夏季锄苗时期的情况，从此可以看出，在春耕、下种时期是没有这个办法的，何如随同这个办法解决了各个不同时期的“生活安排”问题，和“民主自愿结合”问题，更进一步的订出不同时期的不同工资，那么，这个办法不独适用于夏锄时期，而且可爰由于任何一个农时了，不过记者同志提出：“仅锄苗时间，即省工二百八十六个”，“实较个体劳动提高效率二分之一”，这里有两个问题要提出研究：第一、东沟村究竟多少户？人口土地多少？全劳力和牲口劳力多少？记者报导是不明白的。第二、一般说山地每亩每年平均（包括垒岸，修边堰，送粪，春耕下种，夏锄，收割……等全部过程）所需人力和畜力约十个工至十一个半工左右，平地每亩每年平均需人力和畜力约六个半至九个工左右，若以最小的一个五十户，三百多亩土地，一百个左右的劳力的小村庄来说，每季省二百多个工，实在不能算作是提高二分之一的劳动效率。而事实上，劳动效率的提高多少，单就一个时期的劳动结果来计算，那是不够准确的，就以锄苗本身来说吧！锄苗的第一次，因是精耕细作，费工一定较多（当然也要省工），第二、三次因有了第一次的基础，当然省工更多，若以第二、三次的结果而得出结论，那么就不是很准确了，因此，必须根据全年全部劳动过程去计算。
    再次，关于军属地的代耕问题，从记者同志报导之“军属地同样评分，由全组出工票，最后按照每个人的土地劳力担负来看，也有研究之为要，因为军属家庭有很好的富农户，有比较好的中农户，也有不很好的贫佃农户，代耕就需要根据这些实际情况决定不同的代耕办法，不能一概都由大家担负，尤其不应单由小组担负。根据许多地方的经验，大体上都是采用这样的代耕办法，按每日十分顶一工的标准，军属之富农户按十分之六或十分之四出工票，中农户按十分之四或十分之二出工票，贫农或佃户则可不出工票，完全义务代耕。至于其余的不足十分的工票，则全由全村按土地人口多寡分别担负，贫佃农户所应付出的工票，也同样由全村担负，参加代耕的人，不管是与谁家代耕，一律可以得到每日的全工资。实行这个代耕办法的结果，有这样的好处，即既不让大家吃亏，也不让小组吃亏，更不让个人吃亏。我个人认为优待军属的真实意义是在这里，这个办法很可以借鉴。
    最后，仅就上面几个方面再提出如下若干问题以供研究：
    一、科学的生活安排问题——即是集体劳动与自然条件适应的问题：
    抢种，抢锄，抢收，这是全年农事生活中最紧张的三个环节，是各个不同季节不同生活的集中表现，集体劳动常常与个体利益发生矛盾也就是在这个时候，是事情最复杂、问题极容易发生的紧急关头，如果这时这种自然条件与集体劳动发生冲突，那么集体劳动的组织形式就要破裂分解，不少的地方已先后证明了这点，而东沟村多年来的教训尤其证明这点。根据各地经验，为了避免问题的发生，必须民主讨论，科学的慎重的根据自然条件安排先后生活，如下种时，应根据土地之耐旱与否？远近和当风与否的先后秩序去下种。锄苗时，根据苗的大小稀稠的程度确定先后。收割时，根据庄稼成熟与否？当风与否而定缓急。山地、水地、山沟地、平地、平坡地、河滩沙地等与上述先后安排亦有密切关系。
    二、劳力的分工合作问题——即是发挥集体劳动提高生产效率与生产技术的问题：
    根据劳力的强弱与否，技术的熟练与否，而适当的安排生活，配备劳力，是发挥集体劳动，提高生产效率和生产技术的有效办法。根据各地的经验，省工最多，农业、副业搞得很好的地方，多半是爰用了这种办法（当然不是教条搬运）。其具体作法是：经民主讨论，按照农事生活的需要配备劳力，如土地集中者，组织较多的劳力，土地分散者，组织较小的劳力，山地因土地分散，宜分散劳力，平地土地集中，宜集中劳力；春耕、下种、锄苗、收割皆宜如此。另外，应根据不同的农事生活，配备不同的熟练劳力，如犁地的专门犁地，耙地的专门耙地，送粪的专门送粪，点籽的专门点籽等。这样的灵活运用劳力，组织劳力，分工合作的办法，既能发挥一人一技之长，又能省出更多的劳力从事副业活动。
    三，民主自愿结合问题：因为今天基本上还是个体经济基础上的集体劳动，所以在结合上必须是完全自愿的，在小组领导上也必须是民主的，否则必然要失败。关于这种，各地都有了经验，东沟村也同样有了经验。我在这里只提出几个问题研究：第一，应根据土地相近，习惯相近，感情相投的人或户相互结合，因为这样是比较容易结合而且也容易巩固的。第二，不愿参加互助组的人或户，应让其不参加，从另一方面用实际利益中的例子去影响它，推动它，使它从思想内自己去解决和纠正自己观点上的错误。第三，多鼓励，少批评，从鼓励方面去推动某些人的思想自觉，使其自己转变。第四，必需照顾到每个具体组员的本身利益（如婚丧嫁娶，走亲戚（必要的）送客人，以及其它的一些零细家务事等），使它感到互助组是有自由的，不感到有什么不自由的苦恼。第五，在休息或工作时间里（一般的）应绝对避免足以妨碍群众利益的会议形式，一切问题尽可能采用一面工作一面解决的办法；同时经民主讨论规定一些（绝对不能太多）为大家所乐于接受和执行的会议形式和制度。第六，对各个不同时期产生的模范人物、积极分子，应及时的奖励与表扬，并作为定一时期的行动方向。
