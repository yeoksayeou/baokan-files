Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 7th: Paris dispatch: On the afternoon of the 5th, Paris was in a state of general strike. Under the call of the General Confederation of Labor and the Christian Trade Unions, 500,000 workers in various industries in Paris held a general strike for several hours, protesting the Ramadier government's decrees to raise prices and reduce rations, and demanding that Ramadier get out. According to Agence France-Presse, at 3:30 pm on the 5th, the iron gates of the Paris underground railway station were tightly closed, and trains and cars were stopped. From 4:30 pm to 8 pm, post offices stopped working, and at 4 pm, all workers in steel, construction, chemical, and leather factories stopped working. Organized workers and many government employees and department store clerks started marching from various places to the Place de la Concorde at 5 o'clock. The marchers held up flags with the words "We want bread!", "Down with the fraudsters!", "Ramadier resign!" Between the slogans of "Protest against rising prices," "Reduce rations," "Oppose the government's economic policy," the chorus of the Internationale echoed through the streets of Paris. Leaders of the trade unions addressed the demonstrating workers, urging them to take emergency measures to stop the soaring prices, demanding an increase in food rations, and fulfilling the agreement of August 1 between the General Confederation of Labor and the Employers' Federation to increase wages.

　　Simultaneously with the demonstration led by the General Confederation of Labor, the Christian Labor League also led its members in another mass demonstration at the "Palais de Montretout," making the same protests to Ramadier. The strike in Clermont-Ferrand was also rapidly expanding on the 5th. The printing department of the Bank of France, the city's transportation companies, and newspaper offices decided to strike for 48 hours on the 6th to protest the reduction of rations. In Nantes, western France, due to the threat of a wave of strikes, the authorities have assembled troops to protect the city government.

　　Under the impact of the wave of workers' strikes across France, Ramadier was forced to ask the parliament for a fifth vote of confidence. The result of the vote on the 5th was 292 to 243 in favor of confidence. However, the proportion of those who opposed Ramadier had increased from 42.7 percent on July 4 to more than 45 percent, and the majority he won had decreased from 84 votes in the same period to 49 votes. His supporters are less than half of the total number of 586 members of parliament (two votes short).

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 6th: Comprehensive report: The French political situation is swaying in the face of the dollar crisis and the serious situation of workers opposing the reduction of rations. The Ramadier government's expectation that American loans would increase French production has resulted in France facing fierce competition from American capital. Last year, the import surplus was approximately 1.29 billion US dollars, and this year it will reach 1 billion US dollars, equivalent to the US dollar loan that Loeum brought back from the United States last year. This situation has forced French Minister of National Economy Philip to issue a statement to reporters the other day expressing "pessimism about the French situation" (TASS dispatch on the 1st), pointing out that due to the shortage of dollars, French imports from the United States in the next six months will be reduced from 450 million US dollars to 293 million US dollars. Imports of gasoline, textiles, leather, metals and ores, newsprint and livestock feed have all been stopped. 80 percent of the above goods came from the United States. There are rumors in Paris that, in order to avoid further deterioration of the economic situation, the Ramadier authorities will once again beg the United States for new "aid" that is not worth the loss. At the same time, on the domestic front, it announced a reduction in people's rations; this made "the faces of the French pale; because the 200-gram bread ration is 70 grams less than during the German occupation" (Associated Press, August 31). In addition to the reduction of meat and the lack of two-thirds of the required coal in the next six months, the lives of the French people will be further deteriorated. On the other hand, Ramadier also approved an average increase of 10 percent in prices to protect the profits of big capital at the expense of the French people. This policy has aroused the indignation and dissatisfaction of the French working people, and a new wave of strikes by the working class has swept across the provinces. The Peng Qiao automobile factory in Dobre and Dijon, the automobile factory in Lyon, the Brest Naval Shipyard, the Michelin tire factory in Clermont-Ferrand and many other factories, the textile factories, wineries and steel mills in Reims, etc., are continuing to expand strikes and demonstrations. On September 2, symbolic strikes were held throughout France for one day, and the workers unanimously demanded that the original 250-gram ration be maintained, opposed the increase in prices, and demanded that the contract signed by the trade union and the National Federation of Employers on August 1 be fulfilled (stipulating a general wage increase of 11 percent, but was blocked by Ramadier and has not yet been implemented). The General Confederation of Labor and its affiliated trade unions have also held meetings to call on workers and employees to protest the authorities' decree to reduce rations and demand a change in this anti-labor economic policy.

　　法政府投靠美国结果经济更恶化
  　巴黎工人总罢工  要求拉马第滚蛋
  　罢工浪潮已席卷全国各地
    【新华社陕北七日电】巴黎讯：五日下午，巴黎处于总罢工中。在总工会与基督教职工会的号召下，巴黎各业工人五十万人举行数小时的总罢工，抗议拉马第政府之提高物价与减低口粮法令，并要求拉马第滚蛋。据法新社报导：五日下午三时半，巴黎地下电车站之铁栅紧闭，火车汽车均停驶。下午四点半至八点，邮局停止办公，整四点各钢铁、建筑、化学及皮革等工厂的一切工人都停止工作。有组织的工人与许多政府雇员及百货商店的店员，整五点开始由各地向桑德马广场进发，游行者高举旗帜，上书“我们要面包！”“打倒欺诈的家伙！”“拉马第辞职！”在“抗议提高物价”，“减低口粮”，“反对政府的经济政策”的口号声停歇之间，国际歌的齐唱荡漾巴黎街头。职工会的领袖们向示威的工人们发表演说，敦促采取紧急措施制止物价高涨，要求增加食物配给量，履行总工会与厂主联合会八月一日增资的协定。
    与总工会所领导的示威大会同时，基督教劳工联盟亦率领其盟员于“德·蒙脱里宫”举行另一群众示威大会，对拉马第作同样的抗议。克勒蒙腓隆城的罢工，五日亦迅速扩大中。当地之法国银行印刷部门，城市各运输公司及报馆，定六日罢工四十八小时，抗议减低口粮。法国西部之南特城，由于罢工怒潮的威胁，当局已集合军队保护市政府。
    在法国各地工人罢工大浪冲击下，拉马第被迫向议会要求作第五次信任投票。五日就会投票结果，以二九二对二四三获得信任。但反对拉马第的比例已由七月四日的百分之四十二点七，增长为百分之四十五点以上，他所争得的多数，则自同期的八十四票降低为四十九票。他的信任者已不足议会议员总数五八六席之半（差两票）。
    【新华社陕北六日电】综合报导：法国政局飘摇于美元危机与工人反对减低口粮的严重境况中。拉马第政府期望美国贷款以增加法国生产的结果，使法国在美国资本的猛烈竞争下；去年入超约达十二亿九十万美元，今年则将达十亿美元，等于去年勒鲁姆自美带回的美元贷款。这种情势，迫使法国民经济部长菲立普日前在记者会上发表“对法国情况表示悲观”的声明（塔斯社一日电），指出由于美元的短缺，法国此后半年内自美的输入，将自四亿五千万美元减至二亿九千三百万美元。汽油、纺织品、皮革、金属及矿砂、印报纸及牲畜饲料的进口，已一概停止，上述货物百分之八十来自美国。巴黎风传，为避免经济形势的进一步恶化，拉马第当局将再次出颜向美乞讨得不偿失的新“援助”。同时，在国内一方面宣布减低人民口粮；这使“法国人面色苍白；因为二百格兰姆的面包配给量，较德国占领时还少七十格兰姆”（美联社八月三十一日）。加之肉类之减少与今后半年内缺乏所需煤炭之三分之二，将使法国人民的生活更形恶化。另一方面，拉马第又批准物价平均增加百分之十，以牺牲法国人民来保障大资本利润。这种政策，激起法国劳动人民的愤慨与不满，工人阶级的新的罢工浪潮已席卷各省。督布与第戎两地的彭吉奥汽车工厂，里昂的汽车工厂，布勒斯特的海军兵工厂，克勒蒙腓隆的米芝宁轮船工厂及其他许多工厂，里姆斯的纺织工厂、酿酒厂及炼钢厂等的罢工与游行示威，正继续扩大。九月二日法国各地并举行象征罢工一天，工人们一致要求保持原有二百五十格兰姆的口粮配给，反对提高物价，并要求履行为工会与全国厂主联合会于八月一日所签订的合同（规定一般工资增加百分之十一，但为拉马第所阻，迄未实施）。总工会及所属各业工会亦纷纷集会，号召工人与雇员抗议当局减低口粮法令，并要求改变这种反劳工的经济政策。
