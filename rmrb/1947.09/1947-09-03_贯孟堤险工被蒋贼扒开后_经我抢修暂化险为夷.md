　　Xinhua News Agency, Jinji Luyu, 1st: A reporter stationed along the Yellow River reports: After Bandit Chiang dug open the Guànmèng (the unified structure of the embankment where Guàntái is located) Embankment Hazard, the water level at Máojīndù in the upper reaches of the Yellow River suddenly rose by more than ten feet on the morning of the 26th. By the 30th, the water at Táochéngpù in Zhangqiu County (newly established county, located east of Shòuzhāng) in Jiluyu had risen rapidly by 1.2 meters, and is continuing to rise, potentially reaching 2 meters, re-creating the emergency situation of the full trough on August 2nd. The reporter specifically interviewed the person in charge of the Yellow River Commission, who said: "Bandit Chiang dug open the Guànmèng Embankment Hazard. Through the all-out emergency rescue efforts of the military and civilians in our area, we rushed to prepare stone and straw materials day and night, repairing wave nests at any time and any place, temporarily averting danger. The people of the liberated areas will continue to fight against the sabotage of Bandit Chiang with all their strength to defend against the Yellow River floods. However, if Bandit Chiang continues to break the embankment and create dangers by taking advantage of the rising water, then they will bear all responsibility for the submergence of residents along the river."
　　Xinhua News Agency, Jinji Luyu, 30th: Our reporter reports that it was a long-planned scheme for the Chiang army to dig up the dangerous sections of the Guàntái Qián'éwān etc., diverting the Yellow River northwards. Since March 15th of this year, Bandit Chiang, for the first time, took advantage of our unfinished embankment repairs and blocked the Huāyuánkǒu, causing the Yellow River to suddenly advance into its old course, attempting to flood the liberated areas. During the peach flooding period, thanks to the people's desperate rescue efforts, a major disaster was fortunately avoided. At the end of July, as the major flood season arrived, the water level rose sharply, and Bandit Chiang again dug工事 (works) and six deep trenches all over the Chángyuán Embankment, causing the embankment to lose its barrier function. Furthermore, at the Zhūkǒu, Línkǒu and other dangerous sections, bridge ropes were cut, and the Liúzhuāng Gāocūn and other dangerous sections were controlled, preparing to release water. Fortunately, the people of the liberated areas rushed to repair the 1,800-mile embankment day and night, blocking the Yellow River's attack, and Bandit Chiang's conspiracy temporarily failed again. On the 15th of this month, the water level suddenly increased by 58.7 meters, the second water rise after the major flood. Seeing an opportunity, Bandit Chiang chose the Guàntái Qián'éwān and other dangerous sections that had breached in the 23rd year of the Republic of China, digging open hundreds of feet, diverting the Yellow River northwards, attempting to use the massive flow to scour our Yellow River's northern bank embankment, submerging all villages along the river, and destroying the unprecedented bumper harvest this year for the people of Jiluyu for more than ten years. "Chiang Kai-shek is the disaster," the people can see clearly. Transforming anger into strength, they are making every effort to defend against the Yellow River floods. Chiang Kai-shek thinks that the raging Yellow River will submerge the people of the liberated areas, he forgets that since the people of the liberated areas have the power to defeat Chiang Kai-shek, of course, they can also mobilize all their strength to defeat the Yellow River.

　　贯孟堤险工被蒋贼扒开后
  　经我抢修暂化险为夷
    【新华社晋冀鲁豫一日电】驻黄河沿岸记者报导：蒋贼挖破贯孟（即贯台所在该段大堤之统构）堤险工后，二十六日上午黄河上游茅津渡水势突涨一丈余，至三十日冀鲁豫张秋县（新设县，位寿张以东）陶城铺水已急涨一公尺二寸，现正续涨中，可能涨至二公尺，重现八月二日满槽之紧急局面。记者为此特走访黄委会负责人，据称：“蒋贼扒开贯孟堤险工，经我区军民全力抢险，星夜赶办石料秸料，随时随地修补浪窝，暂告化险为夷。解放区人民将继以全力与蒋贼破坏作斗争，以防御黄水，但蒋贼如利用水涨继续破堤出险，那么他们将负淹没沿河居民的一切责任。”
    【新华社晋冀鲁豫三十日电】本社记者报导，蒋军挖断贯台前鹅湾等险工，引黄北流，这在蒋介石是蓄谋已久的事。自今年三月十五日蒋贼第一次乘我修堤未竣，堵死花园口使黄水突进故道，图淹解放区。桃泛期中，经人民死力抢救，幸未成巨灾。七月底进入大泛，水势猛涨，蒋贼又在长垣堤上遍挖工事和六道深沟，使大堤失去屏障作用。更在朱口、临口等险工割断桥绳，控制刘庄高村等险工，准备放水，幸解放区人民日夜赶修了一千八百里大堤，挡住了黄水袭击，蒋贼阴谋又一次暂告失败。本月十五日水位突增五十八公尺七寸，此为大泛后第二次的涨水，蒋贼见有机可乘乃选择了曾在民国二十三年决口的贯台前鹅湾等险工，挖破百丈，引黄北流，企图用大流冲刷我黄河北岸大堤，淹没沿河一切村庄，破坏今年冀鲁豫人民十余年所未有的大丰收。“蒋介石就是灾难”，人民是看得清清楚楚的。他们化愤怒为力量，正尽一切努力防御黄水，蒋介石只以为滔天黄水便会淹没解放区人民，他忘了解放区人民既然有力量战胜蒋介石，当然也能动员全力来战胜黄水。
