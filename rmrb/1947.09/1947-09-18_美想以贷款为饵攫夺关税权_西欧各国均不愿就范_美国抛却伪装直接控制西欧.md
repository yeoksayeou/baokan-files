Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th. Paris dispatch: The work of the "European Cooperation Committee" and the "Marshall Plan" have both encountered significant difficulties. Since the opening of the "European Economic Recovery Conference" on July 15th, the "Cooperation Committee" has been working amid doubts and disappointments. The original plan was to produce a report before September 1st, explaining the economic situation of the 16 participating countries to the United States and how to implement the "Marshall Plan" in order to obtain "aid loans" from the United States. This work has been postponed twice. When the first postponement was announced until September 15th, the United States was very anxious and sent Undersecretary of State Clayton and State Department advisor Kennan to hold an open meeting with the executive committee of the "Cooperation Committee" on August 30th. During the meeting, the executive committee of the "Cooperation Committee" raised three major questions: (1) How much loan can the United States give to each country in the next four years? (2) Western Europe is in extreme economic distress. Can the United States provide "aid" as soon as possible? (3) Some countries disagree with establishing a "European Customs Union" for the United States to monopolize the European market. Is the United States willing to compromise on this issue? As a result, the two sides were deadlocked. After receiving Kennan's report on the meeting on September 5th, the U.S. State Department set up a new trap, claiming that it would convene a special session of Congress to discuss quickly granting loans to the 16 countries. Deputy Secretary of State Lovett also spread the word that the United States needed to "aid Europe" immediately. Clayton even claimed that $2 billion should be loaned to the countries first to get through the winter crisis. The purpose was to use this as a condition to force the 16 countries to reduce their request for $29 billion in loans from the United States over the next four years; and to force them to agree to establish a "European Customs Union" that would lose economic independence, as a basic guarantee for U.S. loans. However, Western European countries were unwilling to submit, and the United States became furious. On the 11th, Clayton publicly criticized the "Cooperation Committee's" report as "a store order list, not a 'mutual assistance' plan, which the United States cannot accept." Twelve hours later, although most countries of the "Cooperation Committee" were forced to declare their willingness to study the establishment of one or more customs unions, Sweden, Switzerland, Norway and other countries immediately expressed their refusal to participate. Bevin and other experts also decided on the 12th to postpone the work of the "Cooperation Committee" indefinitely.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th. Moscow dispatch: An Izvestia diplomatic observer recently commented on the new conspiracy of the United States to directly control the economies of Western European countries, saying: "Now, from the point of view of American monopolists, the time has come to abandon pretense. The American business journal 'Business Week' openly announced that the Marshall Plan has come to an end, and another new plan is taking its place, that is, the direct control of European recovery by the United States. The publication revealed: 'The new plan will require sending 4,000 to 5,000 American experts to Europe.'" If so, these "experts" are still going to Europe to implement the "Truman Doctrine," for example, "expert" Handerson went to reorganize the Greek government, "expert" General Oliven determined the security needs of Turkey, and some "experts" are going to "rebuild the French economy." In short, we see that American monopoly capitalists are taking advantage of the economic difficulties of Western European countries and are nakedly imposing the "Truman Doctrine" and the "Marshall Plan" on Western European countries.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th. Paris dispatch: The U.S. imperialist's act of taking advantage of the fire, clamoring for a "new" plan to openly and directly control the economies and administrations of Western European countries has aroused dissatisfaction among French public opinion. The French newspaper Libération expressed dissatisfaction with the "investigation" conducted by the United States in France, pointing out that "American congressmen are conducting 'unscrupulous and meticulous' investigations." It also revealed the conspiracy of the United States to change the time of French elections, saying: "We should remember that our municipal elections are to be held before the U.S. Congress holds the 'Aid to Europe Plan' debate. American congressmen are also very concerned about the outcome of the election." The Volontaires Progressistes pointed out that "the municipal election has become a big gamble. U.S. Ambassador to France Caffery had talks with Ramadier, advising him to 'delay the election at all costs until the arrival of U.S. aid, at which time it would be beneficial to "solve all problems."'" Le Matin accused the United States of even interfering in French diplomacy.

### 美想以贷款为饵攫夺关税权　西欧各国均不愿就范　美国抛却伪装直接控制西欧

　　美想以贷款为饵攫夺关税权
  　西欧各国均不愿就范
  　美国抛却伪装直接控制西欧
    【新华社陕北十六日电】巴黎讯：“欧洲合作委员会”的工作与“马歇尔计划”已同遭重大困难。自七月十五日“欧洲经济复兴会议”开幕后，“合作委员会”即在疑虑与失望中工作。原定计划于九日一日以前制成一项报告，向美国说明与会十六国之经济情况及如何实施“马歇尔计划”，以求取美国之“援助贷款”，此一工作已两度宣布延期。在第一次宣布延期至九月十五日以前时，美国甚形焦急，曾派副国务卿克莱顿与国务院顾问基南于上月三十日与“合作委员会”的执行委员会举行公开会谈，会谈中“合作委员会”执委提出三个大疑问：（一）美国在今后四年中究能给予各国若干贷款；（二）西欧经济已困窘万分，美国是否能及早“援助”；（三）若干国家不同意为美国垄断欧洲市场而建立“欧洲关税同盟”，美国是否对此问题愿意让步。结果，双方陷于僵局。美国务院在本月五日接获基南对此次会谈之报告后，布置了一个新的圈套，扬言将召开国会特别会议，讨论迅速给予十六国贷款。美副国务卿罗维特也散布空气，说美国需要立即“援助欧洲”。克莱顿并声言应先贷款二十万万美元给各国，以度今冬危机。其目的，是以此为条件，要十六国减低他们对美国要求今后四年贷款二百九十亿美元的数目；并迫使他们答应建立丧失经济独立的“欧洲关税同盟”，作为美国贷款之基本保证。但西欧各国均不愿就范，美国对此恼羞成怒，克莱顿于十一日公开批评“合作委员会”的报告为“乃商店定货单，而非一‘互助’计划，美国不能接受”。十二小时后，“合作委员会”大部分国家虽曾被迫声明愿意研究成立一个和数个关税同盟，但瑞典、瑞士、挪威等国随即表示拒绝参加。贝文及其他专家们亦于十二日决定将“合作委员会”工作无限延期。
    【新华社陕北十六日电】莫斯科讯：消息报外交观察家顷评论美国直接控制西欧各国经济的新阴谋称：“现在，从美国独占家的观点看来，抛却伪装的时间已经到了，美国商界的机关刊物‘商业周刊’公开宣布称：马歇尔计划已经寿终正寝，而另一新计划正取而代之，即由美国直接控制欧洲的复兴。该刊泄露：“新计划将需要派四千到五千美国专家去欧洲。”假若如此，这些“专家”们仍然是为奉行“杜鲁门主义”而去欧洲，例如“专家”汉德生去改组了希腊政府，“专家”欧利文将军决定了土耳其安全的需要，还有一些“专家”要去“重建法国经济”。总而言之，我们看到美国独占资本家利用西欧各国经济困难的窘迫，正赤裸裸地在把“杜鲁门主义”与“马歇尔计划”强加诸西欧各国身上。
    【新华社陕北十六日电】巴黎讯：美帝国主义乘火打劫，叫嚣公开直接控制西欧各国经济与行政之“新”计划已引起法国舆论的不满。法国解放报对美国在法所进行的“调查”表示不满，它指出“美国议员‘在进行毫无顾忌与无微不至的’调查。”并透露美国企图改变法国选举时间的阴谋称：“我们应该记得我们的市区选举是要在美国会举行‘援欧计划’辩论之前举行的，美国议员们也同样地对选举的结果表示十分关切。”义勇军进步报指出，“市区选举已成了一个大赌博，美驻法大使卡佛利曾与拉马第会谈，劝他“不惜以一切代价，拖延选举。直至美国援助到来之时为止，那时就有利于‘解决一切问题’。”晨报则指责美国甚至干预法国外交。
