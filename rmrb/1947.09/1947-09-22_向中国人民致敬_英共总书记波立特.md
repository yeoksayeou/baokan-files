    A Salute to the Chinese People
    Harry Pollitt, General Secretary of the Communist Party of Great Britain
    Comrade Harry Pollitt, General Secretary of the Communist Party of Great Britain, specially wrote an article in commemoration of "May Day" to pay tribute to the CCP and the Chinese people. This article was only recently received and is translated and published as follows:

    The democratic forces of China and Britain are increasingly confident and are stepping up their efforts to achieve a rapid victory. A year ago, all slanders were thrown at the head of the British Communist Party. Today, judging from the voting situation in Parliament, trade unions and other working-class meetings, our party's peace and economic policies have gained increasingly wide support, and even the government has to express its admiration for the work of our party comrades in industry. The harm of American capitalists to the future of our country and other countries, and to American workers, is increasingly recognized by people. Nowhere is this American harm more evident than in China. The struggle of Chinese workers, peasants and all progressive people to resolutely strive for an independent and democratic China has greatly excited the British people. More and more British people are realizing that the future peace and prosperity of Britain is closely linked to the victorious struggle of the Chinese people against domestic reaction, corruption and foreign oppression. The Sino-US Commercial Treaty turns China into a US colony; the US military's refusal to withdraw from China and its harm to the peace-loving Chinese people; the US's reckless provision of aid to the Kuomintang ruling clique to carry out civil war, devastate the Chinese people, and maintain its dictatorial rule; all this has aroused the anger of the British people.

    On behalf of the British Communist Party, I extend warm fraternal greetings to the Chinese Communist Party and all the Chinese people who are striving for independence! I am convinced that the Chinese people will soon achieve victory!

    向中国人民致敬
    英共总书记波立特
    英国共产党总书记波立特同志，为纪念“五、一”特撰文向中共和中国人民致敬。此文最近才收到，兹译载如下：
    中英两国民主力量信心日增，正加紧努力争取胜利的迅速到来。一年前，一切诽谤都扔到英国共产党的头上了。今天，从议会、职工会和其他的工人阶级会议的表决情形来看，我党的和平与经济政策，已得到日益广泛的拥护，就是政府也不得不对我党同志在工业中的工作表示赞扬。美国大资本家对我国及其他国家的前途，和对美国工人的危害，已日益为人们所认识。美国的这种危害，没有别处再比在中国表露得更明显了。中国工人、农民和一切进步人士坚决争取独立民主的中国的斗争，使英国人民已非常兴奋。广泛的英国人民，愈来愈认识到，英国未来的和平与繁荣，是和中国人民反对国内反动、腐败及外来压迫的统治的胜利斗争紧密联系着的。中美商约把中国变为美国的殖民地；美军驻华不撤，并危害和平的中国人民；美国对国民党统治集团滥施援助以进行内战摧残中国人民，而维持其独裁统治；这一切，激起了英国人民的愤怒。
    我代表英国共产党，向中国共产党和争取独立的全体中国人民致热烈的兄弟的敬礼！我深信中国人民不久就将获得胜利！
