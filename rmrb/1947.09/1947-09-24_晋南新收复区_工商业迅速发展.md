    Newly Recovered Areas of Southern Shanxi
    Rapid Development of Industry and Commerce
    [This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch of the 22nd] Industry and commerce in the newly liberated areas of Southern Shanxi are developing rapidly. Originally on the verge of collapse under the devastation of the Japanese invaders and Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan for more than ten years, they have been rapidly restored with the support of the democratic government since our army liberated the area in April. In Xinjiang city, there were 379 commercial firms before the war, but after the devastation, only 280 remained, and the situation was extremely bleak. After liberation, the number rapidly increased to 485, an increase of 106 compared to before the war, and an increase of 205 compared to when the enemy and the stubborn were in power. In Zhai Dian Town, Jishan, the number increased from 85 to 132, and in Yi's City, the number increased from 43 to 87, and the number of vendors increased from 45 to 83. The development of handicrafts is even faster. The number of cigarette factories in Xinjiang has increased from one to 22, and the cotton weaving industry has increased from 41 to 82.

    工商业迅速发展
    【本报太岳二十二日电】晋南新解放区工商业迅速发展。原在日寇与蒋、阎十余年的摧残下已奄奄待毙，自我军四月解放后，经民主政府的扶植，得到迅速恢复。新绛城内战前商号有三百七十九家，后被摧残余下二百八十家，异常萧条。解放以后，迅速发展到四百八十五家，比战前增加一百零六家，比敌顽在时增加到二百零五家。稷山翟店镇由八十五家增至一百三十二家，猗氏城由四十三家增至八十七家，摊贩由四十五家增至八十三家。手工业方面发展更快，新绛卷烟厂由一家增至二十二家，棉织业由四十一家增至八十二家。
