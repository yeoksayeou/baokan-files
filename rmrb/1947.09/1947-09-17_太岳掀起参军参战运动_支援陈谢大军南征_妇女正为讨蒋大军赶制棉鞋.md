　　【This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch, 14th】To support the Chen-Xie Army's southern expedition, all counties in this region have launched a massive campaign to join the army, participate in the war, and support the front lines. According to statistics from more than 30 villages in Yangcheng and Meng counties alone, more than 370 emancipated peasants enthusiastically signed up and rushed to the front lines in two days. After the news of the victory in the southern expedition came, the youths from various villages in the first district of Yangcheng rushed to the district office to sign up, which was overwhelming for a time. After District Chief Chen arranged the order of registration, they registered village by village, one by one. Zhou Youcang, an emancipated peasant from Shahe Village, and others had just returned from carrying salt from Wenxi. Hearing that the district office was registering for the army, they hurriedly put down their loads, not even caring about eating, and rushed to the district to sign up, covered in sweat. Participating in the war and supporting the front lines has become a conscious action of the masses. In addition to the first batch of 20,000 people who went on a long expedition with the army, a second batch is being prepared. Sun Tongsuo, the secretary of the Yuneng Village branch in Jincheng, has already led the second batch of civilian laborers in the village, and everything is ready, just waiting for the order to come down. The militia in the front and rear constantly communicate, mutually agreeing to eliminate scattered enemy soldiers and secret agents. The reply from the militia crossing the river in Yuanqu said: "We are clearing bandits in the ×× mountains. Please cooperate with the militia staying at home to search for the remaining bandits and consolidate Yuanqu." Women have been making cotton shoes for the army crossing the river. They said: "The weather is getting cold, and we have to make them well and send them across the river." In Sba Lian Maoling Village, Jiyuan, the fourth class has made 150 to 160 pairs and has been selected as the county's top-quality shoes. Among them, Zhang Jinyu, an old lady in her fifties, was originally ill, but when she heard that the army had crossed the river and won the counter-offensive, she immediately cheered up and immediately got up to make a pair. The rear organs have also launched enthusiastic donation campaigns, donating money, silver, and clothes to support the front. Jincheng County alone has automatically tightened its expenditures to support the front, saving more than 14,900 yuan per month. Cadres at all levels also donated clothes and food. The former county magistrate and section chiefs, etc., will not receive clothes from now on until Chiang Kai-shek is overthrown and a new China is established. Cadres and cooks in various departments and sections, such as Yang Xiaogui, etc., do not receive cotton clothes, and some have not received public grain for seven months, four months, and three months. Wen Yin prepares his own coal and kerosene for three months in winter. Li Jianlin, the secretary of the Communist Party branch in the Third District, and 16 other cadres voluntarily donated their entire year's public grain, vegetable money, and clothes. Fourteen teachers in Changzhuang, Shangxia Zhang, and other places also do not eat a single grain of public grain. This movement is continuing to move forward.

　　太岳掀起参军参战运动
  　支援陈谢大军南征
  　妇女正为讨蒋大军赶制棉鞋
    【本报太岳十四日电】为支援陈谢大军南征，本区各县掀起巨大的参军参战支前运动，仅阳城、孟县卅余村统计，两天内即有翻身农民三百七十多人踊跃报名，投奔前线。南征胜利消息传来后，即有阳城一区各村青年赶到区署驻地，抢着报名，一时应接不暇，后经陈区长按排好报名次序后，一村挨一村、一个挨一个的报了名。沙河村翻身农民周有仓等，刚从闻喜担盐回来，听说区所正在报名参军，就急忙放下担子，饭也顾不上吃，满头大汗，赶到区上报名。各地参战支前，更成为群众的自觉行动。除第一批二万人随军远征外，又准备下第二批。晋城庾能村支部书记孙铜锁，已领导村里第二批民夫，一切已经准备妥当，只等命令下来。前后方民兵并不断通讯，互约消灭得贼散兵特务。垣曲过河民兵的回信说：“我们在××山上清剿土匪，请留在家里的民兵配合搜捕残匪，巩固垣曲。”妇女已为过河的大军赶制棉鞋，她们说：“天气已凉了，作好还要送过河去呢。”济源社八联毛岭村四大中，就做起一百五六十双，并且被选为全县上等鞋。其中五十多岁的老太太张金玉本来有病，但他听说大军过河反攻胜利，登时精神振奋，立刻起来争着做了一双。后方各机关同样掀起了热烈的献金、献银、献衣支前运动，仅晋城县府自动紧缩开支，支援前线，每月即节省一万四千九百余元，各级干部亦献衣献食。原县长及各科长等从今起不领衣服，直到打倒蒋介石建立新中国为止。各部科干部及炊事员杨小贵等不领棉衣，其中有七个月、四个月、三个月不领公粮者。文印冬三月的煤炭灯油自备，三区中共分委书记李建林等十六个干部自动献出全年公粮菜金、衣服。常庄、上下掌等十四位教员，亦不吃一颗公粮，这一运动正继续向前发展着。
