Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, urgent telegram, 22nd: The Northwest People's Liberation Army, pursuing the bandit troops of Hu Zongnan fleeing south from the Sui (Suide) Qing (Qingjian) line, intercepted the enemy in the Chakou area, 60 kilometers northeast of Yan'an, from the 14th to the 16th, crushing four whole brigades of Hu's mobile forces. Preliminary statistics show that the number of enemies killed, wounded, and captured has reached 4,000 to 5,000.

Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, urgent telegram, 22nd: Hu Zongnan's mobile force, led by Liu Kan and Dong (surname), consisting of five brigades and one regiment, suffered a disastrous blow in the Chakou area between Yan'an and Yanchuan. On the 14th, Hu's army, consisting of five brigades, one independent regiment, two division headquarters, and two corps headquarters, fled back to Yan'an from Yanchuan and was intercepted by our army in the Chakou area. The battle broke out on the morning of the 14th. The entire enemy force mentioned above was concentrated in a small area of less than 15 li both vertically and horizontally in Guanzhuang and Shangliujiahe, with air cover. Our army defeated the 12th Brigade and the 48th Brigade of its 17th Division on the 14th. The fighting stopped at midnight that day due to rain. On the 15th, the two sides confronted each other on the front lines. On the 16th, our army again defeated the 55th Brigade of its 38th Division and the 78th Brigade of its 1st Division; however, the fighting stopped again due to hail and rainstorms. When only one brigade of the enemy remained unattacked, another division of Hu Zongnan came from Qinghuabian to reinforce them, allowing the defeated enemy to escape in a panic. When our army advanced on all fronts, the artillery fire shook the sky, and the enemy was in a state of panic, with chaotic formations, scrambling to escape. The mountain gullies were packed with multiple columns, and the mountains were covered with people running for their lives, discarding light and heavy weapons, clothing, shoes, and hats everywhere. On the 16th, one of our battalions captured more than 60 enemy soldiers at one time, belonging to the serial numbers of five enemy brigades. Hu's army was terrified and only cared about escaping, not having time to contact its own planes, resulting in being bombed and strafed by Chiang's planes. When they hurriedly used white cloth to display liaison signals and busily blew bugles to assemble their troops, the troops had just gathered for a short time when our army's sharpshooters had already selected these targets and fired continuously, hitting the target with every shot, causing heavy casualties to the enemy. During these three days, most of the enemy troops ran out of food and water. According to several prisoners, only officers could eat two or three corn cobs (yujiao) a day for the past three days, and most of the soldiers had to dig raw potatoes and pick raw green beans on the mountains to satisfy their hunger. Occasionally, being able to eat "three-ingredient rice" cooked with potatoes, pumpkins, and corn was considered a great happiness. One squad of bandits even fought to eat "three-ingredient rice" and did not have time to escape when our army approached, and their hands were red and swollen from being scalded while grabbing food when they were captured. Hu Zongnan's mobile forces, after being struck by us this time, have become terrified and demoralized.

    陕北我军追击回窜延安之敌
    击溃蒋匪四个整旅
    初步统计歼匪已达五千
    【新华社西北二十二日急电】西北人民解放军追击由绥（绥德）清（清涧）一线南逃的胡宗南匪军，自十四日至十六日，在延安东北六十公里之岔口地区阻击该敌，击溃胡匪机动兵力四个整旅。据初步统计，毙伤俘敌已达四、五千人。
    【新华社西北二十二日急电】胡宗南机动兵力由刘戡、董某率领的五个旅又一个团，在延安、延川间的岔口地区，受到惨重打击。十四日胡军五个旅一个独立团两个师部及两个军部，由延川向延安回窜，在岔口地区被我军阻击。战斗于十四日晨暴发，在关庄、上刘家河纵横不足十五里的狭小地区中，集中了上述敌军之全部，并有飞机掩护。我军于十四日击溃其十七师之十二旅与四十八旅。是日夜半，因此雨停止战斗。十五日双方在阵地对峙。十六日我军又击溃其第三十八师之五十五旅与第一师之七十八旅；但战斗又因冰雹及暴风雨而停止。当敌人只剩下一个旅没有挨打时，胡宗南的另一个师由青化砭都来接应，溃敌得以狼狈逃走。当我军各路挺进时，炮火震天，敌恐慌万状，队形混乱，争先恐后夺路而逃，山沟中挤成多路纵队，山岭上则是漫山遍野，各自奔命，轻重武器及衣物、鞋、帽到处乱丢。十六日，我军某营一次俘虏的六十几个敌军中，即有属于敌五个旅番号的士兵。胡军惊破了胆，只顾逃命，跑得来不及与自己的飞机联络，以致遭到蒋机轰炸扫射。等到慌忙用白布摆出联络符号，忙着吹号集合队伍，队伍刚集合起来不多时，我军神炮手又早已选好这些目标，连连发炮，炮炮命中，使敌军大量伤亡。这三天中，敌军大部断粮、断水。据若干俘虏谈，三天来只有军官一天才能吃两三个玉米棒子（玉茭），大部分士兵只好在山上挖生洋芋，摘生豆角充饥。偶尔能吃到洋芋、南瓜与玉米煮的“三鲜饭”的就算大幸福，有一班匪军为争吃“三鲜饭”甚至在我军打到跟前时亦来不及逃避，他们被俘时双手均因抢饭而烫得红肿。胡宗南的机动兵力，经我此次打击，已弄得丧魂落魄。
