Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, 4th: A certain unit of the Jin-Sui Liberation Army, starting with the examination of landlord ideology in one squad, developed into a campaign where all soldiers of poor background stood up to clear out landlord ideology and class dissidents, enabling soldiers of poor and hired peasant backgrounds to begin to rise up and become the backbone of the unit. During a six-month period when the squad was working independently outside, it was manipulated by class dissident Li Weidi, who concealed property for landlords and resisted the masses. The squad included four members of poor peasant background, three of whom had already received land in their families, but their class consciousness was vague, and they regarded landlords as ordinary "fellow villagers." After the leadership discovered this, they immediately recalled the squad to conduct self-criticism, and the leading comrades enlightened them to arouse reflection among the soldiers of poor peasant background. Soldier Wu Gangfu recalled that his father had worked as a hired laborer his whole life, and he himself had worked odd jobs at home for many years, yet remained destitute. Comparing his previous life with the happy circumstances after joining the army, he burst into tears. Squad leader Zhao Youwan reflected that he had not recognized the true face of the landlord in the past and had been controlled by the deputy squad leader Li Weidi, causing the entire squad to be deceived by the landlord. The examination revealed that the majority of soldiers had a low level of awareness and had not deeply realized that landlords were the enemy of the people's army in the past, which led to many people being lazy and undisciplined at work, and even deserting. In order to get through to the soldiers' thinking, the leadership submitted the squad's problems to the company's military conference and to discussions in each squad, calling on soldiers of landlord and rich peasant background to liquidate their original ideology, and on poor, hired, and middle peasant soldiers to sweep the dust off their faces. At the meetings, soldiers of poor peasant background reversed their past behavior, speaking the most and speaking with force, while soldiers of landlord and rich peasant background appeared depressed. The leadership gained a deeper understanding from this, discovering that there had been a bias in the class line of army building in the past, and that these active soldiers today were precisely the soldiers who had been consistently regarded as "clumsy and incapable" in the past. Therefore, they further mobilized the soldiers to re-examine their class composition, and as a result, among the 49 people participating in the meeting, 11 were found to be of landlord and rich peasant background, who had previously filled out their forms as poor or middle peasants. It was also discovered that many landlord and rich peasant elements had been promoted to cadres; four of the aforementioned 11 were cadres. However, very few of those from poor backgrounds had been promoted; only two out of 25. For example, poor peasant soldier Zhang Gaofu had been a Communist Party member before joining the army in 1937, and he was still a soldier. However, Li Weidi, who colluded with landlords, was quickly promoted to deputy squad leader after joining the army in 1943. At the same time, it was also found that landlord and rich peasant elements deserted the most, while very few poor soldiers deserted. In the past, the responsibility for reading the newspaper and "political education" was placed on landlord and rich peasant elements, who mostly read interesting news, while reading very little about news and opinions that could raise the soldiers' awareness. After this review, the leadership boldly mobilized poor and hired peasant soldiers to expose the crimes of class dissidents and degenerates in the company, and then, with poor and hired peasant soldiers as the backbone, united with middle peasant soldiers, adjusted cadres, and adjusted the composition of each squad, giving the company a completely new look.

　　晋绥某部清算地主思想调整成份
  　贫雇战士成为部队骨干
    【新华社晋绥四日电】晋绥解放军某部从检查一个班的地主思想着手，发展到全部贫苦出身的战士起来清算地主思想和阶级异己分子，使贫雇农成份的战士，开始抬头成为部队的骨干。该班在出外单独工作的半年期间，被阶级异己分子李维弟操纵，为地主隐蔽财产，对抗群众。班内有贫农成份四人，其中三人的家里已分到土地，但阶级意识模糊，把地主也看成是一般的“老乡”。领导上发现后，即将该班调回作检查工作，领导同志在旁启发引起贫农成份战士的反省。战士吴刚福回忆父亲当一辈子长工，自己在家也揽工多年，却一贫如洗，把以前的和参军后的生活愉快情形对比一下，落下泪来。班长赵有万反省过去未认清地主面目，被副班长李维弟控制，全班上了地主的当。从检查中看出大部分战士觉悟程度较低，过去未深刻认识地主是人民军队的敌人，因而许多人工作疲蹋散漫，发生逃亡。为打通连队战士思想，领导上就将该班问题提交连队军人大会和各班讨论，号召地主富农成份的战士清算其原来思想，贫雇中农战士打扫脸上的灰尘。在会上，贫苦农成份的战士一反过去面目，发言最多，讲话有劲，而地主和富农成份的战士则表现消沉。领导上从此又得到更深刻的启示，发现过去建军的阶级路线有偏向，今天这些活跃的战士，正是过去一贯被认为是“笨手笨脚没有能力”的战士。于是进一步发动战士重新审查阶级成份，结果在参加开会的四十九人中，发现地主和富农成份十一人，过去都填写为贫农或中农，而且查出许多地主富农分子被提拔为干部，上述十一人中即有干部四人；但贫苦成份被提拔的很少，二十五人中只有二人；例如贫农战士张高夫民国二十六年参军前即为共产党员，现在还是当战士；而勾结地主的李维弟在三十二年参军后，却很快被提拔为副班长。同时并发现地主富农分子开小差最多，而贫苦战士开小差的很少。过去将读报“政治教育”责任放在地主富农分子身上，读的大多是些趣味性的消息，而对于提高战士觉悟的消息和言论却读得很少。经此检讨后，领导上就放手发动贫雇农战士揭发该连阶级异己分子和蜕化分子的罪恶，进而以雇贫农战士为骨干，团结中农战士，调整干部，调整各班成份，使连队面目焕然一新。
