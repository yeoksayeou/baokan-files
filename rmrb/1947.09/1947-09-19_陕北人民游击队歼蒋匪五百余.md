　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 15th: The Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region local forces and guerrilla units, on the 10th, along the way from Jia County to Suide, tracked and pursued the 431st Regiment of the 144th Brigade of Chiang Kai-shek's 74th Division, which abandoned Jia County and fled south. First, in the Sunmujiagou area, about 80 miles south of Jia County, at the cost of four wounded and three dead, they routed the regiment and annihilated the entire assault regiment that was supposed to meet them, capturing over 300 men, including the deputy commander of the assault regiment. Subsequently, in the area from Jizhengdian to Thirty Li Pu and Yihezhen, east of Suide, they killed or wounded another 200 of the enemy fleeing south. A total of one rocket launcher, six 60mm mortars, over twenty grenade launchers, thirty machine guns including Canadian machine guns, four American carbines, over 60,000 rounds of ammunition, and one radio station were seized. Note: The Assault Regiment was originally called the "Luochuan Guerrilla Force," later renamed the "Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region People's Self-Defense Army," and was under the command of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit Shaanxi secret service. It had harassed Yan'an, Anse, and Suide, often acting as the vanguard force for Chiang Kai-shek's bandits' invasions, burning, killing, raping, and looting everywhere, incurring the deep hatred of the masses.

  　歼蒋匪五百余
    【新华社陕北十五日电】陕北人民地方部队与游击队，十日在葭县至绥德途中，跟踪追击弃葭县南逃的蒋匪七十四师一四四旅四三一团，首于葭县以南约八十余里孙木家沟地区，以伤四亡三人的代价，击溃该团，并将接应该团的突击团全部歼灭，俘突击团副团长以下三百余人。继又于吉征店至绥德以东三十里铺及义合镇一线，毙伤续向南逃之敌二百人，先后共缴获火箭炮一门、六零炮六门、掷弹筒二十余个、机枪及加拿大机枪三十挺、美式卡宾枪四支、弹药六万余发、电台一座。按：突击团原称“洛川游击队”，后改为“陕北人民自救军”，受蒋匪陕西特务机关指挥，曾骚扰延安、安塞、绥德各地，常作蒋匪进犯时的先头部队，到处烧杀淫掠，群众恨之入骨。
