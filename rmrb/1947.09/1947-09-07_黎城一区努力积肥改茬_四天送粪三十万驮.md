　　Licheng First District Strives to Accumulate Fertilizer and Change Crops
  　Four Days of Delivering 300,000 Loads of Manure
    [Reported by our newspaper from Licheng] In order to expand wheat planting, accumulate more fertilizer and change more crops, increase production to overcome the famine, and support the front lines in eliminating Chiang Kai-shek, the First District, after holding a cadre heroes and activist meeting at five base points throughout the district on August 24th to mobilize, now the entire district is in a fervor of composting, scraping wasteland, and sweeping road soil. According to statistics from 33 administrative villages in the district, more than 700,000 loads of fertilizer have been accumulated. In the six days after the base point meeting on August 24th alone, the entire district composted 167,200 loads of wheat bran and road soil fertilizer, scraped wasteland and cut artemisia to compost 70,300 loads (excluding pen manure, latrine manure, and sheep manure). After the rain on August 25th, labor heroes Wang Fengqi and Wang Jinming from Xia Village immediately convened a meeting of mutual aid team leaders, studied how to take advantage of the wet ground to accumulate more fertilizer. In one day, they accumulated a total of 9,750 loads of wheat bran, pen manure, and soil. The entire village accumulated 13,275 loads of pen manure, 3,390 loads of sewage and latrine manure, and bought 2,011 oil cakes, guaranteeing 30 loads of fertilizer per mu. Taking advantage of the gap when the flooded ground could not be plowed twice, they organized the village's labor and livestock to transport fertilizer. Three people drove six animals, one person loaded, and two people delivered. The masses called it a "three-shift rotation," transporting oil cakes to distant fields and fertilizer to nearby fields. Now, 13,200 loads of fertilizer have been completely transported to the fields before the dry weather. At the fertilizer accumulation meeting in Yanzi Village, labor hero Wen Mixian said: "Accumulating fertilizer is like accumulating gold. Farming without fertilizer is like doing business without capital, it is fundamentally impossible." His group has 240 mu of land, planting 60 mu of regular wheat, and will change 70 mu of crops, guaranteeing 45 loads of fertilizer per mu. Labor hero Zhang Wanghu from Xi Wu said: "Wheat likes loose soil, fertile soil. Deep plowing and applying more fertilizer are essential." He himself planted eight mu of wheat land and has already composted 400 loads of fertilizer, guaranteeing 50 loads of fertilizer per mu. Under the promotion of labor hero Fan Jinde in Hongjing Village, the entire village will guarantee 45 loads of fertilizer per mu. The district's wheat land (regular crop) is 27,638.9 mu. According to the existing 700,000 loads of fertilizer, each mu has been fertilized with an average of 26 loads. It is planned to change crops on more than 8,000 mu of wheat (accounting for 60% of the district's land together with the regular wheat land), still short of 164,000 loads of fertilizer (calculated at 25 loads per mu for changing crops). By the time of wheat planting, 200,000 loads of fertilizer can be accumulated, averaging more than 25 loads per mu for the entire district's regular and changed wheat crops. Statistics for the four days after the rain on August 25th show that more than 337,000 loads of fertilizer have been transported to the fields. (Ren Qing, Man Lin)
