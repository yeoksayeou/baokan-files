    Linjin: Two Thousand People in Linjin Report Vengeance Against Chiang Kai-shek's Secret Agents
    [Report from Linjin by this newspaper] Following the anti-"Oil Mill" and anti-local tyrant struggles, over a hundred natural villages in Linjin County have launched a struggle against secret agents. On August 28th, over 20,000 people in the entire county held a vengeance rally against the secret agents, mourning the four martyrs who sacrificed themselves for the people, including Chang Zhennan, the vice chairman of the South Dachen Farmers' Association, who was killed by secret agents. After Chang's death, the people of South Dachen said: "Losing Chang Zhennan is as painful as losing eyesight for the people of South Dachen." During the rally, Chiang Kai-shek's planes attacked, and the assembled masses did not have time to evacuate, resulting in the death of fourteen people by gunfire. After the planes left, the masses immediately gathered again, their old and new hatreds further increasing their anger, saying: "We will not have good days until we eliminate the big and small Chiang bandits." Then, County Chief Ji first reported the crimes of the recently captured secret agents Yao Jianseng, Yan Jiaen, and four others: "They organized bandits and secret agents to rob the Third District, and a few days ago they killed Chang Zhennan, the vice chairman of our South Dachen Farmers' Association..." After the report, he called on the masses to avenge their hatreds. Under the anger of the masses, the six secret agents paid their blood debt. After the meeting, the people of South Dachen discussed: "Today, we have finally avenged Comrade Chang Zhennan." (Du Bo)
