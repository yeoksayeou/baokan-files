　　Xiyang County Committee Calls for
　　Mass Wheat Planting to Remedy Famine
　　[Report from our newspaper in Xiyang] Our county has suffered successive severe droughts, hailstorms, and wind disasters, with most of the crops withered and dying, leading to a severe famine. Even without further damage, we can only expect to harvest 30% of the usual yield. To effectively overcome the famine and lay a foundation for next year's planting, besides implementing several measures such as transportation, conservation, vegetable sowing, and gathering wild vegetables, the County Committee has specifically called for mass wheat planting. We must seize the opportunity and utilize organizational strength to carry out the following tasks: 1. Prepare wheat fields and cultivate the land. In addition to existing wheat fields, we should expand wheat acreage, repair field edges and build embankments. Fields where crops have withered due to drought can be replanted with wheat. It is required that each person plant half a mu of wheat. 2. Various localities should seize the opportunity to vigorously compost artemisia, prepare potash fertilizer, dig up barren soil, and dismantle kang soil to immediately prepare fertilizer for wheat fields. 3. Wheat seed regulation. To ensure wheat seeds are not affected, the county has allocated one million yuan in loans to be lent to cooperatives for purchasing wheat seeds. In addition to county loans, each cooperative can find its own ways to further regulate and ensure that wheat seed supply is not restricted. The above work should be combined with the weeding campaign before autumn, and it is required to universally weed once before autumn. This will not only promote the early maturity of grain but also ensure the fullness of the grains, striving for an effective way to overcome the famine. (Ziyou, Xin Ying)

　　昔阳县委会号召
  　大量种麦补救灾荒
    【本报昔阳讯】本县连遭严重的旱雹风灾，大部禾苗苦死，形成严重的灾荒，如再不受其它损害，也只能收到三成，为有力的渡过灾荒，并给明年下种打下生活上的基础，除进行运输、节约、撒菜、打野菜等几种办法弥补外，县委曾特号召大量种麦，抓紧时机，发挥组织力量，来进行以下几件工作；一、准备麦田和整理麦地，除旧有麦地外，应扩大麦地，刨边垒堰，已旱枯死的田禾，可改种麦，要求每口人达到种麦半亩。二、各地抓紧时机，除掉卧外，可大力沤蒿粪、火串粪、刨荒土、拆炕土等，立即准备麦地肥料。三、麦种调剂。为使麦籽不受到影响，县里抽出一百万元贷款，贷给合作社，购买麦种，各合作社除县贷款外，可自己设法再加调剂，保证不受到麦籽的限制。以上工作并结合秋前的锄苗运动，并要求秋前普遍锄苗一次，一面能促进粮食的早熟，一面能使粮食上的饱满，求得有力的渡过灾荒。（子由、新颖）
