　　Songshuping Cooperative Prepares Nineteen Shi of Wheat Seeds
    [Reported from Zuoquan by this newspaper] On the 25th of last month, taking advantage of the rainy weather, Songshuping held a meeting of cadres above the mutual aid team leader level to discuss plans for cutting artemisia, collecting mountain manure, and planting wheat. After discussion, in addition to the regular wheat fields, potato fields and bean fields should be used to catch up and plant wheat. The whole village will reclaim another thirty mu of wasteland, expanding wheat fields by one hundred mu. To solve the problem of wheat seed shortages, cooperative leader Comrade Li Rulin bought back four shi of wheat seeds from Wu Xiang. The masses herded their goats in Wu Xiang, earning three dou of wheat every night, and earned fifteen shi of wheat in two months. A total of nineteen shi of wheat seeds were prepared. In the autumn, households borrowing wheat will repay one jin of black beans in exchange for one jin of wheat seeds. This solved the wheat seed difficulty and provided feed for the goats.

　　松树坪合作社备麦籽十九石
    【本报左权讯】松树坪在上月二十五日趁天下雨，召开了互助组长以上干部会议，讨论割蒿打山粪种麦计划。最后讨论，除正茬麦地外，山药蛋地小豆地都要赶茬种麦，全村再灭荒三十亩，扩大麦田一百亩。合作社长李如林同志，为了解决麦籽困难，到武乡买回麦籽四石，群众果实羊在武乡卧地，每夜赚麦三斗，两个月赚麦十五石，共准备麦籽十九石，到秋后借麦户还一斤黑豆顶换一斤麦籽，这样解决了麦籽困难，又有了羊料吃。（秀曾、玉田）
