Overview of the News Industry in the Jinji Luyu Region
    Under the direct leadership of the Central Bureau, the news and communication undertakings in the Jinji Luyu region have become a unified news force throughout the region. Compared with the separate activities of various regions during the Anti-Japanese War, the scale and business have greatly developed.
    The General Branch of this region was established at the beginning of last year, with four branches under it: Taiyue, Taihang, Jinnan, and Jiluyu. Every day, it provides news and articles to the People's Daily published by the Central Bureau and the Taiyue Xinhua Daily, Taihang Xinhua Daily, Jinnan Daily, and Jiluyu Daily published by the party committees of various regions. At the same time, it sends articles to the Xinhua General Branch in northern Shaanxi. The above five newspapers are all printed in letterpress, with a circulation of more than 10,000 copies, becoming the most important spiritual food for the people of the entire region. The Taiyue branch has two sub-branches, Yuebei and Jinnan, both of which send articles by radio. The Taihang branch maintains close contact with 126 county and district mimeographed newspapers and 6,200 correspondents in Taihang, and has received strong support from the joint offices of party committees and governments at all levels. The communication network has a solid mass base, so the reports are relatively timely and excellent. The Jinnan branch has 1,457 correspondents, receiving an average of 3,000 to 4,000 submissions per month. The Jiluyu branch has seven sub-branches and 48 county communication stations in the entire Jiluyu region, receiving about 3,000 submissions per month. Recently, the Yellow River branch and the Henan General Branch have been established, both equipped with radio stations. The former operates along the Yellow River, reporting on the flood situation and the heroic deeds of the people repairing dikes. The latter goes deep into the south bank of the Yellow River to report on guerrilla warfare and land reform.
    In the past year, this region has successively established the Jiluyu Front Reporter Group, the Tongpu Front Reporter Group, the Yubei Front Reporter Group (established jointly with the troops), and the Jinnan Front Reporter Group (established when the Kuomintang army invaded Daming), and organized the broad masses of commanders and fighters to write articles, reporting on the patriotic self-defense war in this region in a timely manner. At the same time, it put forward the policy of "basing itself on this region and serving 30 million people," and strengthened the reporting of local work. The general branch and sub-branches have now established local broadcasting, sending 2,000 words to the four regions every day, conveying the instructions of the Central Bureau, the Border Government, and the Military Region, and exchanging work experiences and people's creations from various places. The general branch recently directly dispatched a local reporter group, carrying a radio station to patrol Taihang and Jinnan, to reflect the current central work. The Handan Radio Station has been established for a whole year, and its business has improved day by day, which is a major undertaking for external publicity in this region, with a large audience in the Kuomintang-controlled areas. From the anniversary on September 1, the station will reform its programs, increase local reports, and continue to rebroadcast the broadcasts of the Shaanxi Radio Station daily.

　　晋冀鲁豫新闻事业概况
    晋冀鲁豫区新闻通讯事业在中央局直接领导下已成为一支全区性的统一的新闻军，较之抗战期间各区单独活动的分割状态，规模与业务均有巨大发展。
    本区总分社于去年年初成立，下有太岳、太行、冀南、冀鲁豫四个分社。每日以电讯及稿件供给中央局出版之人民日报及各区党委出版之太岳新华日报、太行新华日报、冀南日报、冀鲁豫日报。同时向陕北新华总社发稿。上述五种报纸均系铅印，发行额皆在一万份以上，成为全区人民最主要的精神食粮。太岳分社下设岳北、晋南两支社，均以电台发稿。太行分社与太行一百二十六种县区油印小报与六千二百名通讯员保有密切联系，并得到各级党委、政府联合办公室之大力支持，通讯网获有雄厚的群众基础，因而报导比较及时、出色。冀南分社拥有一千四百五十七名通讯员，每月平均可收到来稿三千至四千件。冀鲁豫分社在冀鲁豫全区设有七个支社和四十八个县通讯站，每月可收到来稿三千件左右。近更成立黄河支社与河南总支社，均配有电台。前者活动于黄河沿岸，报导汛情及修堤人民的英勇事迹。后者深入黄河南岸地区，报导游击战争土地改革。
    一年来，本区曾先后成立冀鲁豫前线记者团，同蒲前线记者团，豫北前线记者团（与部队共同成立），冀南前线记者团（蒋军入侵大名时成立），并组织广大指战员写稿，及时报导了本区爱国自卫战争。同时提出：“立足本区，为三千万人民服务”的方针，加强了地方工作报导，现总分社已成立地方广播，每日向四个地区发二千字，传达中央局、边府、军区之指示，交流各地工作经验及人民创造。总分社最近又直接派遣一地方记者团，携带电台巡行于太行、冀南，以反映当前中心工作。邯郸广播电台已创立一整年，业务日有改进，为本区对外宣传一大事业，拥有蒋区广大听众，该台自九月一日周年纪念日起，改革节目，增加地方性之报导，并仍按日转播陕北广播电台之广播。（新华社晋冀鲁豫一日电）
