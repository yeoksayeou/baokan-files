　　Hebei Village Promotes "One Six Nine"

　　Hot Water Seed Soaking, More Manure Application

　　Sowing Done Entirely with Two-Legged Seed Drills

　　[This newspaper, Pingshun News] In the fifth district, Hebei Village retained 156 mu of wheat stubble fields, 31 mu of small mung beans, and 5.4 mu of flax, all sown with wheat; 6.2 mu of millet fields were also sown with wheat, totaling 198.6 mu of wheat. This year, due to emphasis on technology, benefits were obtained. The crops are now growing very differently from the surrounding villages. The technology committee is conducting further research. Based on the fact that there was rain during the mid-summer period, the wheat harvest next year is bound to be abundant, so a technology meeting was specifically convened to study fertilizer. The village has a total of 3,000 dan of sheep manure, which can fertilize 30 mu of land; 100 piles of wasteland were reclaimed, with an average of 50 dan per pile, and each pile was further irrigated with 4 dan of night soil. Two piles per mu can fertilize 50 mu. Livestock in the whole village accumulated 600 dan of manure in two months, fertilizing 6 mu of land; various miscellaneous fertilizers amounted to 1,100 dan, fertilizing 11 mu of land; sheep bedding was brought in from neighboring villages, covering 13 mu. Influenced by the example of Wang Anfu, director of the Armed Committee, who did not sleep at noon and went to the hillside to collect sheep manure, all the elderly men and children in the village launched a sheep manure collection campaign, and have now collected 8 shi, which can make 120 dan of night soil, enough to fertilize 60 mu of land. Leaving 25 mu for catch cropping, the plan is to cut 8,000 jin of artemisia; if that is not enough, methods such as using green manure as padding and oil-treating wheat will be used to supplement. Labor hero Jiao Fuxi wants to experiment with bean fertilizer, applying 1.5 dou of black beans per mu. The beans are crushed, soaked in boiling water, and dried in the sun, then the fertilizer is applied before sowing the wheat, which can replace 150 dan of fertilizer. Research on wheat sowing technology: There are many weeds in the fields now. If the wheat seedlings don't grow well next spring, the grain harvest will be reduced. Taking advantage of the damp ground, children are mobilized to collectively weed the fields for two days, and 32 mu have been weeded; the embankments have been reinforced for 35 zhang in three days. Hot water seed soaking is implemented, and all wheat sowing is done with two-legged seed drills. 120 mu of "One Six Nine" wheat variety is being promoted, and a merit-making campaign is being launched to promote fertilizer accumulation. The plan is to plow 50 mu three times, and 100 mu with plow behind plow, all deep plowing and meticulous cultivation, with technology being studied everywhere. (Zhang Jian)

　　河北村推广一六九
  　温汤侵种多上粪
  　下种全用两腿耧
    【本报平顺讯】五区河北村留正茬麦地一百五十六亩，小绿豆三十一亩，胡麻五·四亩，都赶种麦，谷地赶茬六·二亩，共种麦子一百九十八亩六分。今年因重视技术，得到利益，现在庄稼长的和周围村大不一样，技术委员会更加研究。根据今年中伏有雨，麦子明年一定丰收，特召开技术会研究肥料，村上共有羊粪三千担，能上地三十亩，改荒一百堆，每堆平均五十担，每堆再用四担圊肥灌了，每亩地上两堆，可上五十亩，全村牲口两个月积肥六百担，上地六亩，各种杂肥一千一百担，上地十一亩，请来外村羊卧地十三亩。在武委会主任王安富晌午不睡觉，到山坡上拾羊粪的影响下，全村老汉儿童都展开拾羊粪运动，现已拾八石，能造圊肥一百二十担，可上地六十亩。留下赶茬二十五亩，计划割蒿八千斤，再不够用，则用绿肥垫地及油滚麦子等办法补足。劳英焦伏喜要试验上豆肥，一亩上一斗半黑豆，把豆碾破，用开水一浸晒干，先下肥再种麦，能顶一百五十担肥。研究种麦技术：现在地里的野草很多，明春麦苗不长，少收粮，现趁地湿，发动儿童集体到地里去拔两天，拔了三十二亩，三天打了岸边三十五丈。实行温汤浸种，种麦全部用两条腿耧种。推广一六九小麦一百二十亩，并开展立功运动推动积肥，计划犁三遍的五十亩，犁套犁的一百亩，全部深耕细作，处处研究技术。（张健）
