【This Newspaper, Taiyue, 8th】The Second District of Yishi, along with the development of the liberated masses' armed forces, villages have spontaneously organized militia self-defense teams, liberation teams, armed groups, etc., to protect the interests of the liberated masses. Activists in Gaojiazhuang called for the organization of a militia, and immediately more than [unclear number] people joined, concentrating many broadswords, spears, and homemade guns, and requesting the government to issue rifles. After struggling against the landlords, the masses in Xichenyao Village believed in their own strength and also organized a self-defense corps, carrying weapons day and night, checking pedestrians inside and outside the village, clearing household registrations, and covering the struggle, making it impossible for special agents to infiltrate. Taihezhuang, a small village of more than fifty households, also organized a self-defense team. The captain, Cheng Jianjia, said: "If the special agents dare to come, we will take care of them!" In addition, Chenzhuang, Jiazhuang, East and West Zhang, Baicun, Nanwangzhuang and other villages have also successively organized peasant armed forces and launched a direct land war with Chiang Kai-shek's special agents.

【This Newspaper, Taiyue, 8th】The masses in Siwang Village, Wanquan, launched a fierce land war with Chiang Kai-shek's special agents. After the activists Xue Anqing and Xue Liduan were assassinated by Chiang Kai-shek's special agents, the masses did not retreat in fear. The land still had to be divided, and the landlords still had to be struggled against, so they organized their own armed forces. On the night of the 17th of last month, more than ten Chiang Kai-shek special agents attempted to surround and capture activists. Xue Gongyi and Xue Zhangui were on guard on the roof, and after discovering them, they beat gongs to warn the whole village and fought the special agents. Another group of special agents went to surround Xiang Liwen, Xiang Musheng, etc., but were also discovered. At this time, gunshots rang out everywhere, driving the special agents away in a panic. The next day, the liberated peasants celebrated their victory and expanded their armed forces. The county gave a special circular of commendation, calling on all villages to learn from Siwang Village, resolutely suppress special agents, and defend liberation.

【This Newspaper, Taiyue, 8th】Since participating in the divisional commendation meeting, the heroic Xing Sanyuan and Cheng San's underground work team of the Lingshi Geziwang have been working harder to avenge Comrade Weiqing, a member of the Chinese Communist Party County Committee in the county. From the 1st to the 9th of last month, they fought five battles and won five victories in nine days, totaling: seventeen enemy regular soldiers killed, wounded, and captured, three rifles seized, more than one hundred and fifty rounds of ammunition, three hundred and forty-five catties of wheat, and one pillbox destroyed. In particular, on the 9th, using the "excavation" tactic, they attacked the enemy stronghold of Lijiashan and surrounded it on three sides, capturing four enemies alive and seizing three rifles, with no casualties on our side.
