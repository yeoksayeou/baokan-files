　　The Newspaper of the British People –
　　An Introduction to the Daily Worker
　　A National People's Newspaper
　　In Swinton House, near the bustling Trafalgar Square in London, a small group of people record and help compile modern British history every day. None of them are important figures in the current government, but whether in Westminster (the seat of the British Parliament) or in various government departments, no one is more devoted to measuring British policy from the perspective of results and the welfare of the people of the world. Their profession is journalism, and their product is the Daily Worker – the mouthpiece of the British Communist Party.
　　The Daily Worker has now become a recognized national newspaper. It competes with the entire plutocratic press to gain influence. Labour Party leaders regard it as an opponent to the Labour Party's organ, the Daily Herald, but read it carefully. Ministers and members of Parliament pay attention to every criticism or suggestion it makes. The three copies of the Daily Worker in the House of Commons reading room are rarely unoccupied. Trade union leaders study strategies from it, and workers like its excellent labor correspondence. Foreign news agencies often quote it. Its coverage of foreign affairs is as well-informed as those of major newspapers with "ministerial backgrounds." Its features are both lively and informative. It now publishes two sheets daily, with a circulation of 100,000 copies, and 130,000 copies every Saturday.
　　Growing and Strengthening Through Hardship
　　The Daily Worker has reached its present position after a road of arduous struggle. On New Year's Day 1930, with the help of workers, shop assistants, and intellectuals, it was finally born in the form of a small octavo newspaper after overcoming various technical difficulties. Its predecessor was the British Communist Party's weekly organ. On the third day after its publication, it encountered resistance from newspaper wholesalers and could not enjoy the distribution conditions enjoyed by other major newspapers. However, the founders of the Daily Worker did not lose heart; they carried out a tenacious battle. They divided London into twenty-four districts and sent twenty-four people in trucks every day to deliver newspapers. Distribution manager Castro still recounts stories of bloodshed here and there when recalling the difficult days of the past. During the Popular Front period in 1935, the British Communist Party launched a major campaign to build the party newspaper, adding machines, supplementing personnel, and calling on party members to distribute newspapers. In 1936, it reached a record of 500,000 copies daily and 1.2 million copies every weekend.
　　During World War II, the Daily Worker was severely tested. Home Secretary Morrison closed the Daily Worker on January 21, 1941, without a court trial. On April 16 of the same year, a Nazi incendiary bomb hit and completely burned down the newspaper's building. The enemies of the newspaper clapped their hands and laughed, saying: The Daily Worker is dead. But the facts proved that they laughed too early. The Party launched and organized a mass movement to revive the Daily Worker and received a strong response from the British people. Trade unions, cooperatives, intellectuals, and even the Labour Party and the Trades Union Congress sent telegrams to the Home Office, demanding the lifting of the ban. On August 26, 1942, Morrison was finally forced to lift the ban. After only ten days of hard preparation (buying machines, finding personnel), the Daily Worker reunited with its readers on September 7.
　　In order to make the Daily Worker a first-class national newspaper with a large circulation based on modern news technology, it was changed to a cooperative shareholding system at the end of 1945, with each share costing one pound and each person allowed to purchase a maximum of two hundred shares. People subscribed very enthusiastically. George Bernard Shaw bought the maximum limit of two hundred shares with a check for two hundred pounds. There were also many other famous investors.
　　The Party Fights for Its Newspaper
　　In Britain, the trustification of newspapers is no less than in the United States. Nine major newspaper magnates control the vast majority of newspapers. Technically, the Daily Worker cannot compete with them. However, the Daily Worker has its own characteristics and develops according to the favorable conditions that come with these characteristics.
　　Forty-three-year-old editor-in-chief Rust used concise, matter-of-fact words to state the development rules of the Daily Worker:
　　The first rule: "The Party must fight for its newspaper. Cachin attributed the victory of L'Humanité (organ of the French Communist Party) to the Party fighting for it. Workers, intellectuals, and party workers go out to sell newspapers."
　　The second rule: "The Party obviously cannot sell a bad newspaper. Every new reader of the Daily Worker must be won over. Reading the Daily Worker is an important political transformation for this reader, but it is not enough to just sell the newspaper to the reader; they must also be won over and retained. This is the task of doing good work."
　　The British Party has always attached importance to the needs of the Party newspaper. The Party often sends a member of the Politburo to serve as editor-in-chief. The Party's first consideration is the political leadership of the newspaper, and the Party has never thought of entrusting the newspaper to just an experienced journalist. Rust is now a member of the Politburo of the British Communist Party. He is a self-taught journalist, of working-class origin, has worked in trade unions, and served as the first secretary of the British Communist Youth League.
　　Rust's Newspaper Experience
　　Rust has rich experience in running newspapers; he has done any kind of work in the Daily Worker. He often summarizes his experience in a concise tone:
　　"Journalism is an industry that requires learning." "The basic point of doing a good job in journalism is to quickly reflect facts, issue news, and at the same time, impart the correct point of view so that readers know what is happening in the world."
　　Rust divides Communist journalism into three issues:
　　"First and most importantly, to politically know and understand what is happening." This requires constant vigilance and attention, and applying Marxism to objective reality.
　　"Second, to write it in a style that the people truly love to see and hear." In his view, expressing problems is also one of the basic problems in journalism.
　　"Third, news and information should be published in conjunction with the correct point of view."
　　Rust said: The key to solving these problems lies in the unity of Marxist theory and journalistic skills.

### 英国人民的报纸——工人日报介绍

　　英国人民的报纸——
    工人日报介绍
  　全国性的人民报纸
    在伦敦闹市金十字路附近的一座斯温吞大厦里，每天有一小班子人在纪录和帮助编制英国的近代史。他们之中没有一个人是现政府的要人，但无论在威斯敏特（英国会会址所在地）或政府底各部中，都没有人比他们更虔诚于从结果、从世界人民福利的观点来衡量英国的政策，他们的职业是新闻工作，他们的产品是工人日报——英国共产党的喉舌。
    工人日报现在已成公认的全国性报纸。它和整个富豪们的报纸竞争以争取影响。工党要人们把它看作是工党机关报每日先驱报的敌对者，但却细心地阅读它。部长们和国会议员注意它每一条批评或建议。下院阅览室中的三份工人日报很少闲空着。职工会负责人从它上面研讨战略，工人则喜欢它的卓越劳工通讯。外国通讯社经常引用它。它的外交问题通讯和那些有“部长背景”的大报一样地灵通。它的特写既生动而又翔实。它现在每日出两张，销行十万份，每星期六销十三万份。
    在艰苦中成长壮大
    工人日报之达到今天的地位，是经过一段艰苦斗争的道路的。一九三○年元旦，在工人、店员和智识界集资帮助下，它在克服种种技术上困难之后终于以八开小报的形式诞生了。它的前身是英共的机关周刊。在它出版后的第三天，就遇到批发报商的抵制，不能享有其他大报所享有的发行条件。但是工人日报的创建者们并不灰心，他们进行了坚韧的战斗。他们把伦敦分为二十四个区，每天派二十四个人乘着卡车去送报。发行经理卡斯特罗在回忆当年艰苦日子时，仍不时说出这里流血那里流血的故事。一九三五年人民阵线时，英共发动了一个建设党报的大运动，添置机器，充实人员，号召党员散报。一九三六年，它曾达到每日销五十万份，每周末销一百二十万份的纪录。
    在二次大战中，工人日报受到了严重的考验，内政大臣摩利逊于四一年一月二十一日不经法庭的审讯，封闭了工人日报，同年四月十六日，纳粹燃烧弹命中并完全焚毁了报馆的房屋。报纸的敌人们拍手欢笑说：工人日报死亡了。但是事实证明他们笑得太早了。党发动和组织了一个争取工人日报复活的群众运动，并得到英国人民的有力响应。职工会、合作社、智工界，甚至工党和职工大会都纷纷致电内政部，要求取消禁令。四二年八月二十六日，摩利逊终于被迫取消禁令。经过短短十天的艰苦筹备（买机器，找人员），工人日报又于九月七号和它的读者重聚了。
    为了使工人日报在现代新闻技术基础上成为一个有广大销路的第一流的全国性报纸，它在一九四五年底改为合作社股份经营制度，每股一金镑，每人最多购二百股。认购的人非常踊跃。萧伯纳以二百镑的支票买了最高的限额——二百股。其他名流投资者也很多。
    党为它的报纸战斗
    在英国，报纸的托拉斯化并不下于美国。九家大报阀握有绝大部分的报纸。在技术上，工人日报是不能和它们竞争的。然而工人日报有它自己的特点，并根据与这些特点而俱来的有利条件向前发展。
    四十三岁的总编辑鲁斯特以简洁、实事求是的词句说出工人日报的发展规律：
    第一条规律：“党必须为它的报纸而战斗。加善曾把人道报（法共机关报）的胜利归功于党为它而战。工人、知识分子和党的工作者走出大门去卖报。”
    第二条规律：“党显然不能去卖一种不好的报纸。必须争取工人日报每一个新读者。阅读工人日报就是这个读者政治上重要的转变，但光是卖报给读者还是不够的，还必须赢得他们和保持他们。这是做好工作的任务。”
    英国党一贯重视党报的需要。党经常派一位政治局委员去担任总编辑。党首先考虑的就是报纸的政治领导，党从来没有想把报纸付托给只是一个有经验的新闻工作者。鲁斯特现在就是英共的政治局委员。他是一个自学成功的新闻工作者，工人出身，做过职工会工作，并且担任过英国共产主义青年团的第一任书记。
    鲁斯特的办报经验
    鲁斯特有丰富的办报经验，他做过工人日报中的任何一样工作。他常以简洁的口吻总结他的经验说：
    “新闻工作是一门行业，需要学习”。“做好新闻工作的基本一点是迅速反映事实，发出新闻并同时赋以正确的观点，使读者知道世界上发生了什么事情。”
    鲁斯特把共产主义的新闻工作分作三个问题：
    “第一和最重要的是在政治上知道和理解发生了什么事情”。这需要不断的警觉和留心，并把马克思主义运用到客观现实上去。
    “第二是以人民真正喜见乐闻的风格把它写出来。”在他看来，表现问题也是新闻工作中基本问题之一。
    “第三是发表新闻和消息时应同时结合以正确的观点。”
    鲁斯特说：解决这些问题的关键在于马克思主义理论和新闻技能的统一。
