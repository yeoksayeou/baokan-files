Xinhua News Agency, Jinji Luyu, 16th - The people in the guerrilla areas on the south bank of the Yellow River in Jiluyu warmly welcome the East China People's Liberation Army under the command of Generals Chen, Su, Chen, Tang, and Ye, advancing into the Luxinan area. Wherever the army went, the masses delivered water and food, welcoming and seeing them off on both sides of the road, and donating comfort goods one after another. Lu Juhe, a liberated farmer from Xiangshan Village, Sixth District of Dong'a, donated 500 yuan as soon as he heard that he was comforting the East China counter-offensive army. When his wife heard about it, she rushed to the village office and said, "Let me donate 600 yuan!" The village cadre said, "Your old man already donated it, you don't need to donate!" She said, "Liberation is not just for him, I have also been liberated." The village offices of various villages were crowded with people donating labor goods to the army. On August 20th, the garrison of a certain headquarters of the East China Field Army was crowded with thousands of representatives of the masses from various places carrying comfort items.
　　This newspaper, Jiluyu, 16th - On the 11th of last month, more than 40 stretchers from the Fourth District of Nanfeng, led by Li Luhe, the deputy of the county brigade, and comrades Ma Zhancheng, went south to transport the wounded. After the task was completed, they crossed the river at the Luo Lou Ji Shan Ding Lou three ferry. The enemy arrived soon after, and enemy planes strafed in the air. In an emergency, Comrade Jiang Yuji, a supplier, proposed using the dugout canoe method to cross the river. Comrades Li Luhe and Ma Zhancheng then gathered everyone to discuss the method of crossing the river, but everyone expressed doubts and looked embarrassed. In the midst of the silence, the squad leader of the Li Tai Village in the team volunteered to take the lead in the experiment. At the same time, several activists were willing to go into the water with the squad leader for the experiment. Then, eleven beams were exchanged for a small donkey carrying supplies. Touching the wood, they jumped into the water. A group of water heroes floated in the turbulent torrent, and quickly reached the north bank. They broke through Chiang Kai-shek's so-called natural barrier for 400,000 troops and created a miracle. After they returned to the south bank, the comrades on the south bank bundled beams and stretcher bed sticks into rafts. Li Luhe and Ma Zhancheng distributed and arranged them in order, without any confusion. Everyone entered the water. In about three hours, all of them reached the north bank without any loss. All 685 stretcher bearers crossed the dangerous Yellow River safely without any loss.
　　This newspaper, Taiyue, 15th - From 6 pm on the 12th, the Taiyue area was completely shaken by the news of the all-out counter-offensive. Everyone was talking about it, especially the telephone of the Taiyue Xinhua Branch, which was busy reporting the news to various places and organs all day long. The next day, the good news from Dabie appeared on Yangcheng Street. That night, the Xiguan Village Office held a meeting. All the cadres and masses expressed their willingness to support the front line with practical actions, and to plant and harvest the land of military dependents and the families of conscripted laborers first. Originally, the village stipulated that 500 mu of wheat should be planted, and it was agreed to increase it to 800 mu. Song Changqing, a retiree from Yue Zhuang, hurriedly wrote a congratulatory letter to Pan, the company commander of the first company of the 39th Regiment, with whom he had fought together before and who is now at the front. He said, "I am so happy that you have won such a great victory. It is a pity that I have been disabled six times and cannot personally participate in the great counter-offensive. I can only write to wish you more victories and make more contributions to the people!" At this time, more than a thousand civilian laborers from Qinyuan who had followed the army south happened to return to Yangcheng and were immediately surrounded by people, asking them about the situation of fighting across the river. The civilian laborer Yang Haiyou said: "As soon as our army crossed the Yellow River, Chiang's bandit soldiers ran away in panic. Those who could not run were either killed or captured alive. The Longhai Railway was confiscated by us!" At this time, the listeners happily said: "In the past, Chiang's bandits wanted to attack us, but now we have attacked them!" Yang Yiren compared it and said: "Chiang's bandits are like a dilapidated house that cannot be repaired. We are like a newly built courtyard wall. We have already laid the foundation and erected the pillars. Our troops crossing the Yellow River is like taking down the beams and pillars of Chiang Kai-shek's dilapidated house again!" Various organs are enthusiastically carrying out class investigation and ideological investigation. After receiving this news, they became even more excited. In addition to sending telegrams of congratulations, the enthusiasm for learning has become even higher.

　　黄河南岸群众抬水送饭
  　欢迎华东反攻大军
    【新华社晋冀鲁豫十六日电】冀鲁豫黄河南岸游击区人民，热烈欢迎陈、粟、陈、唐、叶诸将军所部华东人民解放军挺进鲁西南地区。大军所至，群众送水送饭，夹道迎送，并纷纷捐献慰劳品。东阿六区香山村翻身农民卢聚合，听说慰劳华东反攻军，马上捐了五百元，他老婆知道后，连忙跑到村公所说：“我捐六百元吧”！村干说：“你小他爹早捐啦，你不用捐了”！她说：“翻身不只他自己翻身，我也翻了身。”各村村公所门前拥挤着捐献劳军物品的群众。八月二十日，华东野战军某司令部驻地，聚集来自各地的担着慰问品的群众代表达数千人。
    【本报冀鲁豫十六日电】上月十一日，南峰四区四十多付担架，由县大队副李鲁和同马占中二同志带领南下运送伤员，当任务完成之后，在罗楼基山丁耧三渡口渡河，敌人随后赶到，敌机亦临空扫射。在紧急情况中，忽有供给员姜玉吉同志提出用独木渡河办法，李鲁和马占中同志便召集大家商讨渡河办法，但大家都表示怀疑，面有难色。正在沉闷之际，该队李台村分队长自报奋勇，愿首先带头试验，同时又有几位积极分子愿与分队长先下水试验，于是以驮给养的一匹小驴换得十一根梁木，摸着木头跳入水中，在波浪滔天的洪流中，漂着一群水上英雄，很快便到达了北岸，他们冲破了蒋介石所谓要当四十万大军的天险，创造了奇迹。他们返回南岸后，南岸的同志便纷纷用梁木和担架床棒捆成木筏，由李鲁和马占中同志分配排好次序，丝毫不乱，全体入水，约三小时，全体毫无损失的到达北岸，全队六百八十五名担架队员，无一损失，安全渡过黄河天险。
    【本报太岳十五日电】从十二日下午六时起，太岳区完全为全面大反攻的消息所震动，话无不以此为内容，尤其太岳新华分社的电话机，整日忙着给各地各机关报告消息。第二天阳城街上就出现了大别的捷报。当夜西关村公所召开会议，全体干部群众表示要用实际行动来支援前线，对军属与参战民夫家属的地，要先种先收。原来该村规定种麦子五百亩，公议增加到八百亩。岳庄荣退人宋长青，连忙给来从前一起战斗过、现在前方的三十九团一营一连潘连长写祝贺信，他说：“你们打了这样大的胜仗，真叫我高兴，可惜我挂了六次彩残废了，不能亲身参加伟大的大反攻，只好写信祝你们多打些胜仗，为人民多立些功劳！”此时又恰巧随军南下的沁源千余民夫返回阳城，立刻被人所包围，问他们打过河去的情形，民夫杨孩有说：“我军一过黄河，蒋贼兵马吓得乱跑，跑不了的，不是打死，便是活捉，陇海铁路都被我们没收了！”这时听的人高兴的说：“过去蒋贼想打到咱这来，现在反被咱打过去了！”杨伊人比方着说：“蒋贼就象一间破烂不能收拾的房子，我们就象新修一座院墙，已打好基地，竖了柱子，咱部队打过黄河，就象把蒋介石的烂房子又下了梁，又下了柱！”各机关正在热烈的进行查阶级查思想，得到这个消息后，更为兴奋，除发电祝贺外，学习情绪更加高涨。
