    Renzhuang Women Pick Late Cotton Flowers
    [This newspaper, Licheng News] When the Renzhuang Technical Committee was studying the final cotton trimming techniques, it accepted past experiences. Everyone unanimously proposed that they must pick the late cotton flowers this year. Technician Shen Baoquan said: "We suffered a loss last year because we didn't pick the late cotton flowers. We didn't pick much cotton, and we delayed planting another crop after autumn. We couldn't get into the fields to plant this year." After discussion, the conclusion was that on the White Dew solar term, all unopened cotton flowers should be picked clean, so that the strength of the cotton could be concentrated, resulting in more large bolls, the cotton would be good and quickly open, and we could quickly harvest it all, plant another crop, and next year's crops would grow well. The next day, the technical instructors of each team convened women's meetings to promote the benefits and techniques of picking late cotton flowers. Because the men were busy planting wheat and couldn't spare the time, the women were mobilized to pick them. The women immediately supported this. Activist Yang Ying said, "If we pick the late cotton flowers well, we can also spin good yarn!" A total of fifty-seven women in the village were organized into eight groups, and they picked very carefully, completing the picking of 120 mu of cotton fields in two days.

    多产早收纺好线
    仁庄妇女打晚花
    【本报黎城讯】仁庄技委会研究最后一次修理棉花技术时，接受了过去经验，大家一致提出今年一定要打晚花。技术员申保全说：“去年没打晚花，可吃亏啦，花也不多摘，耽搁秋后也没垡下茬，今年种地出不来。”大家研究结果，是白露节，把没开的花全部打净，棉花力量集中，能多结几个大圪桃，花又好又快硼，早早收净，就能垡下茬，明年庄稼也能长好。第二天各队技术指导员，就召开妇女会宣传打晚花的好处和技术，因男人种麦赶不上，发动妇女打，当即得到妇女的拥护，积极分子杨英说：“打好晚花咱还能纺好线哩！”全村共五十七个妇女，组织了八个小组，打的很细致，在两日内就打了棉花一二○亩。
