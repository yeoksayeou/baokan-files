    [This newspaper's Taihang dispatch of the 24th] The Taihang PLA Officer Training Regiment was extremely excited to hear that the People's Liberation Army had begun a major counter-offensive. In recent days, it has spontaneously launched a campaign to accuse and seek revenge against the Chiang Kai-shek ruling clique, hoping to achieve self-reform as soon as possible, stand with the people, and end the criminal rule of the traitor Chiang Kai-shek. Lower-ranking officers from military backgrounds were greatly saddened and angered when recalling the historical experiences of their families. Liu Desheng, a second lieutenant and deputy platoon leader of the Eighth Company of the 146th Regiment of the 49th Brigade, was from Tongshan, Jiangsu. During the great famine of 1919, his entire family had no grain to eat. His brother was shot dead by the landlord with a shotgun for digging up rapeseed in the field of the landlord Wu Da. Liu's sister-in-law worked as a hired laborer at the home of landlord Wu Laoqi and was forced to hang herself after being raped by the landlord. Afterward, Liu's mother died in hunger and indignation. Finally, Liu Desheng had no other way to survive, so he sold his sixteen-year-old sister to a Fujian rice merchant for seven yuan. From then on, his family was scattered. He followed his father to Xuzhou City and worked as a blacksmith for eight years. Later, he wandered around Kaifeng and other places. In 1936, he finally decided to join the army to make a living. It was not until the year before last that he was promoted to deputy platoon leader. Liu Desheng, who had endured more than ten years of hardship in the military, burst into tears when he spoke about this. He gritted his teeth and said: "I have lived for forty-five years, and today is the first time I have spoken out about my pain. I understand that I must fight Chiang Kai-shek desperately to be human!" At this time, all the PLA officers in the audience shed tears of sympathy and were extremely indignant. Private Yuan Zhenghe recounted the tragic death of his mother, who was shot by the Han traitor Zhang Lanfeng's troops during the Anti-Japanese War. He sobbed and said: "My mother died beside me, and her blood stained my whole body red." He was a conscripted soldier in 1944. At this time, the crying of the puppet soldiers in the audience became louder. An out-of-staff captain of the Third Provisional Column wiped away his tears with his sleeve and shouted: "Cry, comrades! Pour out all your grievances in front of your relatives, turn grief into strength, and avenge your parents! The time has come for us to unite with the people and tear Chiang Kai-shek into a thousand pieces!" After speaking out their grievances, especially the lower-ranking officers from military backgrounds, their awareness was greatly raised. Liu Juncai, a second lieutenant attached to the headquarters of the Third Provisional Column, said: "If I hadn't been liberated, if I had been shot dead on the front line, wouldn't I have died in vain?! I didn't know who I was dying for, and I didn't know why I was dying!" He also said to the instructors kindly: "In the past, I thought the Communist Party belonged to you, but now I personally feel that the Communist Party belongs to all the Chinese people. Only by relying on the Communist Party can I avenge my grievances."
    [This newspaper's Taihang dispatch of the 22nd] Since late August, the Taihang PLA Officer Training Regiment has continued to graduate officers in batches. To date, more than 1,200 PLA officers who have graduated from the regiment and returned to their hometowns. Among them are Xie Maoquan, brigade commander of the 140th Brigade of the 70th Division; Liu Guangxin, brigade commander of the 119th Brigade of the 64th Division; Yang Xianming, brigade commander of the 104th Brigade of the 47th Division; Song Tielin, commander of the 543rd Regiment of the 181st Brigade of the 55th Division; and Wang Suiqing, commander of the 6th Regiment of the Third Provisional Column, and other generals and colonels, totaling more than 150 people. Before leaving, each PLA officer formulated plans to avenge Chiang Kai-shek and make contributions to the people, based on their own circumstances. A second lieutenant platoon leader from a military background who had only a rudimentary knowledge of literacy often silently recited the People's Liberation Army's policy of leniency during his study time. When he spoke to the reporter, he recited the ten specific contents of the policy of leniency fluently and could explain every word. He said: "If Chiang Kai-shek forces me to do it again this time, I will unite with others to publicize our policy and write it down and paste it out at night. I will do it secretly." At the farewell, many officers gave speeches with tears in their eyes, urging each other: "When we go back to reunite with our parents, wives, and children, do not forget the Communist Party and the kindness of the liberated area people towards us."
