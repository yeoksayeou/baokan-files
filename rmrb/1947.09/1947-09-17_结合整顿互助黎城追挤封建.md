　　[This newspaper's report from Licheng] Licheng integrates the rectification of mutual aid to pursue and squeeze out feudalism. After the large-scale emancipation movement last winter and the review movement carried out throughout the county this year in conjunction with production, the economic foundation of the landlords has been basically destroyed, and they have also suffered a serious blow politically. However, their thinking has not truly succumbed to the peasants. They are drilling everywhere, attempting to take the opportunity to counterattack the peasants and maintain their parasitic life. Certain departments in the revolutionary camp, especially economic organs and sideline production, have become the "air raid shelters" for landlord secret agents. Landlords at home are also wandering outside, seeking easy jobs and earning money to eat and drink extravagantly due to lax management. Those who participate in mutual aid teams earn a lot of peasant wages because they have little land. Wang Guonan, a landlord in Xiazhuang, earned more than 600 jin of rice in wages in addition to five months of labor exchange. Some secret agent landlords even conspired to sabotage. Liu Changgui, a secret agent landlord in Beiliu, organized the murder of village cadres. The peasants were very dissatisfied with the above. After being emancipated economically, they further demanded that the landlord class be suppressed in thought and action under the control of the peasants themselves. The leadership boldly approved the peasants' demand to step on the backs of the overthrown landlords. In the production rectification and mutual aid over the past half month, a county-wide movement to squeeze out feudalism has been launched; nine public-owned stores, one hundred and four cooperatives, six schools, and most villages have been involved in this movement, squeezing out two hundred and four landlord secret agents, and strictly managing them in the mutual aid teams. In addition, 420,000 Jichaopiao, 740 silver dollars (silver dollars are only from five villages' statistics), 30 shi of grain, 85 jin of cotton, and other things have been recovered. The main experiences in the movement are:

　　1. Thoroughly implementing the mass line to create a conscious mass movement: To subdue the landlords ideologically and carry out control, it is necessary to fully mobilize more than 90% of the peasants. Therefore, it is very important for us to rely on the branch and the poor peasant hired laborer activists from the investigation of class, investigation of thought, and investigation of performance to mobilize the masses. The masses in the city's shops checked the implementation of the public security agreement and found that the landlord Li Liangbi was slippery on both sides, trying to escape the supervision of the public security team at home and in the shop. The leadership put forward: "Who does this kind of thing?" The masses immediately realized that "This is what landlord secret agents do." Then they checked the history of these guys and discussed: "Why did these guys, who have always been bad, come to our shops and cooperatives?" The masses immediately realized that landlord secret agents were looking for cooperatives and shops to hide. They were determined to squeeze out these "rotten meat." This determination arose from the understanding of the essence of the landlords, thus finally isolating the secret agent landlords. The method of Xiazhuang started from checking the performance of the landlords in production. The peasants mutually pointed out the sabotage activities of the landlords. Everyone realized that the past hope that the landlords would "change three times and turn nine times" was a wrong understanding. The bad ones must be strictly controlled. Facts in some areas have proved that only through in-depth ideological mobilization can a conscious movement of the masses to squeeze out feudalism be quickly and powerfully formed.

　　2. After more than 90% of the peasants are fully mobilized, strict management should be given to the stubborn landlord secret agents who conspire to resist the peasants, without giving them any freedom and democracy. An attitude of winning over should be adopted towards the secondary feudal objects and the not-too-bad young men and women and children of the main objects' families. In short, different treatments should be given to different objects. The peasants in various places put forward two major laws for the bad landlords: one is to cancel their right to govern. Everything in the village government has nothing to do with the landlords. For example, Beiliu clearly stipulates that landlord secret agents have no right to speak, vote, elect, or be elected, and unconditionally obey the command of the peasants. They are told to do what they are told to do, and they cannot do what they are not told to do. They are not given any democracy, only the reasonable obligation to obediently serve the peasants through labor and continue to repay debts. The other is to let them solve the problem of food and clothing by laboring for the peasants to repay debts. For example, in Xihuangxu, each landlord is required to cultivate one mu of land for the military dependents as a wartime burden, and the remaining land of the military dependents without labor is cultivated by the landlords, who are responsible for feeding them and carrying water for the military dependents without labor. The wages of landlords are generally reduced everywhere (compared with the labor exchange wages of peasants). If the above two major laws are violated, the peasant court will handle them by itself. This management method greatly improves the production enthusiasm of the peasants and consolidates the mutual aid teams.

　　3. One of the characteristics of the development of the feudal squeezing movement is the combination of squeezing, pursuing, and managing, that is, the departments where the landlord secret agents are located squeeze outward, the local masses pursue outward, and the mutual aid teams in various places strictly manage them. In this way, the three forces unite to carry out a pursuit war against the landlords, which is very powerful. The feudal squeezing in the city first starts with each shop squeezing outward from its own department, breaking the idea that "squeezing ourselves will damage business" from the consistent thoughts and actions of the landlords. For example, after the county cooperative concretely checked and studied the thoughts and actions of the landlord Hai Song, it felt: "We have to squeeze him out quickly!" But it is not enough to rely on our own department to squeeze him out, so we also launched a mass struggle. Finally, after being cleaned out, the village immediately sent someone to call him back to the village and strictly manage him, blocking the loophole for the secret agent landlords to drill. There are also some landlord secret agent housewives who take the opportunity to jump into the ranks of the peasants through remarriage to act as tyrants, even bringing three or four children or even grandchildren, the oldest being over twenty years old. This is a kind of speculation. After the peasants became aware of this, they also treated these people as landlords for management.

　　结合整顿互助黎城追挤封建
    【本报黎城讯】黎城结合整顿互助追挤封建。经过去冬大规模翻身运动与今年全县普遍结合生产进行的复查运动，地主经济基础基本上被摧垮，政治上亦受到严重打击，但其思想并未真正向农民屈服，到处钻空，企图乘机向农民反攻与维持其寄生生活。革命阵营中某些部门尤其是经济机关与副业生产，成为地主特务的“防空洞”，在家地主亦因对其管理不严，而借搞副业为名，在外流逛，讨轻头，赚下钱大吃大喝。参加互助组的则因其土地少，大赚农民工资。霞庄地主王过南五个月变工外，尚赚工资米六百余斤。更有些特务地主阴谋破坏，北流特务地主刘长桂组织谋杀村干部。以上这些，农民非常看不过眼，在经济上翻身之后，进一步要求将地主阶级从思想行动上压束在农民自己手掌中。领导上即大胆批准农民在被打倒的地主背上踏一脚的要求，半个月来的生产整顿互助中，展开全县性的挤封建运动；有九个公营商店，百零四个合作社、六个学校与大部村卷入这一运动，挤出二百零四个地主特务，严格管理在互助组中。并追出四十二万冀钞，七百四十元银洋（银洋仅五个村统计），三十石粮食，八十五斤棉花等东西。运动中的主要经验为：
    一、贯澈发动群众观点造成群众自觉运动：要从思想上压服地主，并进行管制，就必须将百分之九十以上的农民全部充分的发动起来，因此我们上下一致，依靠支部与贫佃雇积极分子从查阶级查思想查表现中来发动群众就很重要。城内商号群众从检查对治安公约执行中，查出地主李良弼是两头滑，在家与商号均设法借故逃脱治安组监督，领导上提出：“谁们才这样干？”群众一下就认识到“这样都是地主特务。”跟着又检查了这些家伙历史，并讨论了：“这些家伙一贯坏为啥来我们商店与合作社？”群众马上认识到地主特务是找合作社商店当隐身草。决心挤掉这些“烂肉”，这一决心是从对地主的本质认识中产生的，因此也就最后孤立了特务地主。霞庄的办法是从检查地主生产中的表现入手的，农民相互提出了地主的破坏活动，大家认清了过去希望地主“三移九转”是认识错了，对坏的一定要严格管制，若干地区事实证明，只有经过深入的思想发动，才能迅速有力的形成广大群众挤封建的自觉运动。
    二、百分之九十以上的农民充分发动起来以后，对阴谋反抗农民的顽固地主特务给予严格管理，不给其任何自由与民主，对次要的封建对象与主要对象家庭不太坏的男女青年儿童采取争取态度，总之不同对象不同对待。各地农民对坏地主提出两条大法：一条是取消其当政权，村政一切与地主无干，比如北流明确规定地主特务没有发言权、表决权、选举与被选举权，无条件听从农民指挥，叫他干啥他干啥，不叫他干啥就不能干啥，不给以任何民主，只有服服贴贴向农民劳动服务继续还债的合理义务。再一条是让他们从向农民劳动还债中解决衣食问题。如西黄须让每个地主向军干属义务代耕一亩地作为战勤负担，无劳力军干属其余地让地主耕种管他饭吃，并由其负责给无劳力军干属担水。各地普遍降低地主工资（与农民变工工资）。如果违犯以上两条大法，由农民法庭自行处理。这种管理办法，大大提高了农民生产情绪，并巩固了互助组。
    三、挤封建运动发展特点之一是挤、追、管三结合，即地主特务所在部门向外挤，当地群众向出追，各就各地互助组严格管，这样子三种力量联合向地主进行追击战，非常有力。城内挤封建首先是各商店由本部门向外挤，从地主一贯的思想行动中打破：“自己先挤营业受损失”的思想。如县联社具体检查研究了地主海松思想行动以后，觉得：“可得赶快挤哩！”但只靠自己本部门挤还不够，又发动了群众性的斗争。最后清洗出去，马上由村上派人叫回村去，严格管理起来，杜塞了特务地主钻空。还有些地主特务主妇借改嫁跳入农民中作威作福，甚至随带有三、四个孩子以至孙子，大的达二十余岁，这是一种投机，对这些人，农民此次觉悟起来后，同样当作地主去管理。　　　　（联合办公室、杨柯）
