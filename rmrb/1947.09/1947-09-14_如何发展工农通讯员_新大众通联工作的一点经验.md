These experiences are from the past, and some are already outdated. Currently, the entire region needs to develop worker-peasant correspondents on a large scale. New experiences are waiting for everyone to explore. Writing these down is just for reference.

I. Acknowledge Correspondents as Superiors

To develop and organize worker-peasant correspondents to write, the editors and those doing liaison work must first clarify this point: they are serving the worker-peasant correspondents, and the correspondents are the masters of the newspapers and magazines. Those of us who hold pens are their subordinates and helpers. If this idea is not properly established, nothing can be discussed. Take two small things as examples: worker-peasant correspondents' manuscripts often have crooked handwriting. As a manuscript reader, you must be patient and meticulous in reading and discovering problems. When writing back to the correspondents, you must write carefully and not carelessly. The correspondents' writing may be irregular because they are just learning to write, and we can understand it. If our writing is sloppy and careless, they won't understand it, and even good suggestions will not be accepted. There are many such things. If we don't clarify the idea of serving the masses, which for liaison workers means first serving the correspondents, it is easy to assume a "superior" attitude and become detached from the masses. Because we are constantly talking about guidance, telling them how to write and how to interview, we often make the mistake of not being humble enough towards the worker-peasant correspondents and not respecting their manuscripts enough. To put it more seriously, this is a matter of attitude and also a matter of standpoint.

II. Encourage Correspondents' Enthusiasm for Writing

Many worker-peasant correspondents are afraid of writing at first. Some think they lack knowledge and can't even speak fluently, so how can they get published in the newspapers? Some even think that writing is something that people with "cultural knowledge" do. To break through the "timidity" of the correspondents, we must first make them understand that newspapers and magazines are run for them; they must run it themselves, because all work must be done through them, and to exchange experiences in work, everyone must write. Writing is not difficult; if you can speak, you can write. Writing is the best learning, and the more you write, the faster you will improve. As long as they write the first article, whether it can be used or not, the manuscript reader must find the good points to encourage them; the liaison person must reply immediately, asking them to write again. For worker-peasant correspondents' manuscripts, do not limit their length. In fact, they cannot write long articles. Some writing a thousand words or so are already sweating profusely, unlike ordinary writers who like to say empty words and nonsense.

III. Establish "Mutual Aid Groups"

Shortly after the launch of "New Masses," it was noted that district and village cadres were busy with work and had little time to study. It was difficult for them to learn to write at once. It was proposed that those who could write should try their best to act as recorders for comrades who had material but couldn't write. At that time, this phenomenon was common in villages: those who could write a few words were mostly far from the work, and their writing was often empty talk; worker-peasant comrades were creating material every day, and they were the headquarters of all manuscripts, but they couldn't write. In order to break the mystery of "articles," we also excerpted some speeches from poor peasants at grievance meetings and group meetings, and sent the publications containing these speeches to those comrades. This made everyone clearly understand that what they said was a manuscript, and "articles" were not mysterious at all. Some correspondents worried about not learning the writing format. "New Masses" also proposed: there is no format for writing. Write how you do your work, and it's okay to write it as a letter. These letters are articles, as long as you make your own opinions clear.

IV. Correspondence Groups

Because "New Masses" had few staff and few people went out, it limited the assistance in helping correspondents organize correspondence groups. In places with groups, in addition to helping them with mutual writing, we repeatedly put forward such an opinion: do not only write for "New Masses." Most of the manuscripts for "New Masses" focus on writing about a relatively complete event. Some worker-peasant comrades have just started writing, and they are not used to writing like this. It is easier to learn to write news. We encourage them to write news and help them transfer manuscripts. Those suitable for the local county newspaper are transferred to the local county, and those suitable for the People's Daily and Xinhua Daily are transferred to these two newspapers. This enables the materials of each person in the correspondence group to be written as much as possible, so that they will not feel that organizing a correspondence group is meaningless if they have not been affected by writing several articles.

V. Supplement, Supplement, and Supplement Again

Worker-peasant correspondents are different from ordinary writers. They ask you to modify their manuscripts and correct typos. Many people don't care whether the manuscript is used or not, they just hope "to make a suggestion." In addition, the manuscripts used by "New Masses" generally do not have a strong sense of timeliness; therefore, for many manuscripts, the manuscript reader sees that they are not perfect, that one place is not clear, and that another place needs to be supplemented, they will send it back to the correspondent and ask him to supplement those materials. Some manuscripts are supplemented three or four times before being put together and rewritten. In this way, on the one hand, the manuscript is perfected and enriched, and on the other hand, the correspondent slowly learns to investigate, research, and analyze.

VI. Give More, Take Less

District and village cadres are busy with work. At first, they are enthusiastic about writing. They plan to write a certain number of articles a month. At this time, you must earnestly tell them that you should write as many manuscripts as you have materials, and don't write if you don't have materials. When they are busy with work and don't send manuscripts for several months, you should still write to them and contact them as usual. Help them solve difficulties and problems as usual, and sometimes send them some books and periodicals that are helpful for writing. "Give more, take less" can be said to be a rule for developing worker-peasant correspondents, because they can only write about the work they do, and once they have finished writing one thing, they have nothing to write; at the same time, they urgently need help to improve their culture, and they often write to ask for help in solving difficulties in life and study.

After its launch, "New Masses" also clarified this point: this publication is for workers, peasants, and soldiers, and it must be run by the workers, peasants, and soldiers themselves. The more people come, the better. Otherwise, it will revert to a magazine run by a few literati. Therefore, we attach great importance to liaison work. To contact the masses, we must do a good job in liaison work. For every worker-peasant comrade who has raised a question to the publication, written a letter, asked about an illness, or donated money for books and newspapers to comfort the army, we try our best to turn him into a reader and into the master of the publication—a correspondent.

VII. Find People Who Have Contact with the Masses

In addition to regularly paying attention to the questions raised by each correspondent comrade, their composition, their past and present work, and the situation in their work area, the liaison department of "New Masses" pays more attention to how the correspondent connects with the masses. In the work of sending books and newspapers to comfort the army, we promptly pay attention to the activists in the factory, village, and organization. Some worker-peasant correspondents do not know how to write at first, but they are very enthusiastic about organizing others to write for "New Masses" and subscribe to "New Masses." We also regard these comrades as the backbone. In the past, we repeatedly asked correspondents to expand the scope of writing, but it had little effect, because some of them had no contact with the masses at all, or even stood on the opposite side; some of them did not have enough contact, and there was no way to expand the scope of writing. Only in every movement can we find those who have contact with the masses, can the scope of writing be expanded, and can everything, reader conferences, communication networks, etc., have a foundation.

VIII. Still Need to Go Further

Now, some villages and farmers' associations have organized their own correspondence groups. The more thorough the land reform, the more widely the communication network with worker-peasant comrades as the backbone will develop. How to adapt to their needs and make "New Masses" a publication truly run by the vast number of workers, peasants, and soldiers is something we are still exploring. Here, what we have already felt is that "New Masses" is still in the form of a book. Because it is a book and the publication time is long, there is still a step to be taken to timely reflect the works and opinions of worker-peasant correspondents and to timely solve the problems they raise. Therefore, we are now considering how to further solve this problem.

　　如何发展工农通讯员
  　新大众通联工作的一点经验
    冯诗云　章容
    这些经验是过去的，有的已经过时了。目前，全区都要大规模发展工农通讯员，新的经验还待大家来摸索，把这些写出来，只是供大家作个参考。
    一、要承认通讯员是上级
    要发展组织工农通讯员来写稿，编辑的人与作通讯联络工作的人，首先就要明确这一点：自己是给工农通讯员服务的，通讯员才是报纸、刊物的主人，我们这些拿笔杆子的，是他们的下级、伙计。这一点想法摆不正，一切都无从谈起。就拿两件小事来说：工农通讯员来稿，弯弯扭扭的字多，作为一个看稿的人，就得耐心细致的去看，去发现问题；回头给通讯员写信时，自己却要规规矩矩的写，不能潦草。通讯员写得不规矩，是他才学写，我们是可以认的；我们写得马虎潦草，他就认不得，再有好意见，他也就接受不了。又如，工农通讯员很直爽，稍有不对他就要提个意见，有些误会的地方，就只能慢慢解释，不能也在信上发一通脾气。诸如此类的事情很多，如果不把为群众服务，在通联的人来说，就是首先为通讯员服务这一个思想明确，就最容易摆“上级”架子而脱离群众。因为，我们天天都在那里谈指导，叫怎样写如何采访，往往会犯对工农通讯员不够虚心，对他们的稿子不够尊重的毛病。说得重一点，这是态度问题，也是立场问题。
    二、鼓励通讯员写稿热情
    好多工农通讯员，开头都怕写稿。有些认为自己肚里没墨水，连话都讲不顺溜，怎样能上报？有的更认为写稿是那些有“文化水”的人干的。要打破通讯员们“小胆”的这一关，首先就要使他们明了报纸、刊物就是给他们办的；还要他们自己来办，因为一切工作都要通过他们来做，做工作要交流经验，大家就要来写稿。写稿并不困难，能说就能写。写稿就是最好的学习，稿子写得多，自己进步也才快。只要他写了第一篇，不管能用不能用，看稿的人就要找出好的地方来鼓励；通联的人，就要马上回信，要求他再写。对工农通讯员的稿子，不要限制他的长短，事实上，他是写不长的，有的写上千把字，已经满头大汗，不象一般写稿的人，好说些空话、废话。
    三、成立“互助组”
    “新大众”创刊不久，注意到区村干部工作忙，学习时间少，一个时候都要学会写稿，还有困难。便提出能写的人，尽力给有材料写不出的同志当纪录。当时，一般村里都有这种现象：能写几个字的多半同工作离得远，写起搞来空话多；工农同志天天在创造材料，他们就是一切稿子的大本营，可是写不出。我们为了打破“文章”的神秘性，还摘录了一些诉苦会、小组会上贫苦农民的发言，并把登这些发言的刊物，寄给那些同志。使大家确实明白，他们说出来的话就是稿，“文章”并没有什么神妙。有些通讯员耽心学不会写稿的格式，新大众又提出：写稿就没有什么格式，工作怎么做的你就怎么写，写成信也行，这些信就是文章，只要把自己的意见说清楚就好了。
    四、通讯小组
    新大众因为人手少，外出的人不多，限制了帮助通讯员组织通讯小组。有小组的地方，除了帮助他们如何互助写作，曾经反复提出这样一个意见：不要单给新大众写稿。新大众的稿子，大半偏重于写一件比较完整的事情，有些工农同志才开始写稿，他是不惯于这样写的。比较容易学习的还是写新闻，我们就鼓励他写新闻，帮助他们转稿，适合本县报纸的转给本县，适合人民日报、新华日报的，就转给这两个报纸。使通讯小组里各个人的材料，都能尽量写出来，不致于连写几篇都没有影响，感觉得组织通讯小组也没啥来头。
    五、补充补充再补充
    工农通讯员不同一般写文章的人，他们要求你修改他的稿子，改正错字。有许多人并不在于稿子用不用，他们只希望“能提个意见”。加上新大众用的稿一般说时间性不太强烈；所以，有许多稿，看稿的人见着写得不完善，那一个地方不明确，那一个地方还要补充，就给通讯员再寄回去，请他补写那些那些材料，有的稿子补写三、四次，才拿来合在一起重新编写。这样，一方面使稿子完善充实，一方面也就使通讯员慢慢学会调查、研究、分析。
    六、给得多要得少
    区村干部工作忙，起初写稿劲头大，自己订计划一个月要写多少篇，这个时候要恳切的向他们说，有多少材料写多少稿，没有材料就不要写。他们工作忙起来，几个月不来稿，还是要照旧给他们写信联系。有困难、有问题照样帮助他们解决，有时还可寄一些对写作有帮助的书刊去。“给得多要得少”，可以说这是发展工农通讯员的一条法则，因为他们只能写他们做的工作，写完一件便没有写的了；同时，却迫切要求帮助他提高文化，生活、学习上碰到困难，也常写信来要求解决。
    新大众在创刊以后，也明确了这样一点：就是这个刊物是办给工农兵看的，就必须要工农兵自己来办，来的人越多越好。不然，便会回复到几个舞文弄墨者办的同人杂志去。所以，把通联工作看得很重要，要联系群众，就要做好通联工作。凡是给刊物提了个问题，写过一封信，问过一回病，给书报劳军捐过一笔钱的工农同志，我们便尽量想法把他变成读者，变成刊物的主人——通讯员。
    七、找同群众有联系的人
    新大众通联科除经常注意每个通讯员同志提出的问题，他们的成份，过去与现在的工作，他那个工作地区的情形，更注意通讯员如何同群众联系。在书报劳军工作里，我们便及时注意了该工厂、村里、机关中的积极分子。有些工农通讯员起初不会写稿，但却很热心组织别人给新大众写稿，订新大众，这些同志我们也一样看作是骨干。从前我们曾屡次要求通讯员扩大写稿范围，起的作用很小，因有的根本就同群众无联系，甚至站在相反的一方面；有的也联系得不够，写稿的范围是没有办法扩大的。只有在每一个运动里，找寻那些同群众有联系的人，写稿范围才能扩大，一切读者会、通讯网等等，也才有基础。
    八、还要进一步
    现在有些村里，农会里面已经自己组织了通讯小组，土地改革越彻底，以工农同志作骨干的通讯网，一定会更普遍的发展起来，如何来适应他们的需求，使新大众真正变成广大工农兵办的刊物，我们还在摸索。这里，已经觉得的，就是新大众还是一本书的形式，因为是书，出版的时间又长，要及时反映工农通讯员的作品和意见，要及时解决他们提出的问题，毕竟还差着一步。所以，现在我们正在考虑着如何能更进一步解决这个问题。
