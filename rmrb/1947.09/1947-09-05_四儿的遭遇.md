　　The Ordeal of Si'er
  　(An Interlude During the Liberation of Yuncheng)
    Guo Qiang
    "Comrade: I am thirsty, I need medicine. I was hit by a cannonball last night in the city. My name is Si'er, from Diao Village, south of Xiao Pi Kou."
    I asked him, "Why did you go to the city? How did you get hit by a cannon? Why didn't you hide?"
    Then he began to pour out his story:
    "The Chiang Kai-shek troops' lackeys at Xiao Pi Kou, when they heard that Liu Bocheng's army had crossed the Yellow River, panicked and fled south overnight. They grabbed me as they passed our village, seized a cart and a big ox, and dragged me to the city with curses and beatings. They only gave me some thin gruel to drink every day, and no fodder for the ox; it was almost starved to death! Every day, I had to haul dirt clods, tear down houses, and haul bricks and timber to reinforce the bunkers on the city walls, regardless of whether I was hungry or exhausted. If I was a little slow, they would either beat me with sticks or kick me. These beasts are not Chinese; they are more vicious than the Japanese devils. When the Eighth Route Army came to attack the city, they forced us villagers to stand at the entrances of the bunkers, and even forced us to stick our heads out of the bunker openings to watch. If we saw the Eighth Route Army coming up from the trenches, we had to report it, or they would shoot us.
    I stood on the bunker, watching and watching. Soon, comrades came up one after another. But I didn't snitch. The bastards asked me, 'Have they come up?' I said, 'They haven't come up.' I thought to myself, even if I'm beaten to death, I can't tell them. Anyway, both big Chiang and little Chiang don't want us to live. I just hope you come up quickly and kill these bastards to avenge us. Just then, a cannonball hit, wounding my leg and back. I cried out, 'I've been hit!' and crawled down below. Soon after, you came up. Then I had courage. I shouted, 'Don't shoot, I'm a civilian! They forced me to stand guard, and I was hit by a cannonball. They are inside, and there's a heavy machine gun in there!' Later, comrades shouted that the Eighth Route Army would treat prisoners of war leniently and not kill those who surrendered. Six bastards and a machine gun crawled out of their tortoise shells. I found a walking stick, led the ox that was almost starved to death, and followed the comrades, escorting those bastards, out of the west gate, and came here to you."

　　四儿的遭遇
  　（解放郓城中的小插曲）
    郭强
    “同志：我渴，我要上药，我是昨夜在城里被炮弹打了的，我叫四儿，萧皮口南面刁庄的。”
    我问他：“你为什么到了城里，怎么给炮打伤了，你怎么不藏起来呢？”
    接着他便滔滔不绝地叙说着他的遭遇：
    “萧皮口蒋军爪牙们，听到刘伯承大军渡过了黄河，便急得连夜南窜，路过俺庄将俺抓走，抢了一辆大车、一条大牛，连骂带打将我带到城里，每天只给喝点糊涂，牛不给草料，快饿死啦！天天替他拉土块、拆房子、拉砖拉木头，加修城上的碉堡，不管你饿死累死，稍微慢一点，不是棒打，就是脚踢。这些畜牲不是中国人，比日本鬼子还毒。八路军来攻城时，他们硬逼着俺们老乡站在炮楼洞口了着，还硬逼着把头伸出炮楼口外瞧着，看到八路军从壕里上来就报告，不报告就枪毙。
    我站在炮楼上了着了着，一会儿同志们一个跟一个上来了。但我没有啃，龟孙们问我：“上来没有”，我说：“没有上来，”我心里想，打死我也不能说。反正大老蒋，小老蒋都不叫俺们活的，我只盼着你们快上来杀死这些龟孙，给俺们报仇。就在这时候，一个炮弹打来，打伤了我的腿和背膀，我叫了一声：“招着了”就爬到下面去了。不一会儿，你们上来了，这时我有胆了，我嚷着，不要打，我是老百姓，他们逼着我放哨，叫炮弹打着了，他们在里边，那里还有挺重机关枪呢！后来，同志们喊八路军优待俘虏，缴枪不杀，六个龟孙，一挺机枪，钻出了乌龟壳。我找了一根拐棍，牵着这条快饿死的牛，跟同志们，押着那些龟孙，一块出了西门，便到你们这里来了。
