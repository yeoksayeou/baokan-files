　　The Japanese Bandits' Methods of Slaughtering the People:
  　Chiang Kai-shek Shamelessly Applies Them
    [Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] Recent documents seized by our army from Chiang Kai-shek's Ministry of National Defense prove that after Chiang Kai-shek invited the Japanese war criminal in the invasion of China, Okamura Neiji, to be his military advisor and directly ordered Okamura to participate in the command of his troops to slaughter the Chinese people; he also completely inherited the mantle of the Japanese bandits in tactics, advocating the so-called "pacification strategy guerrilla warfare" and "operational essentials in areas occupied by bandit gangs," etc., which were deeply hated by the military and civilians in the liberated areas during the Anti-Japanese War and repeatedly suffered heavy blows.

    The first document, "Pacification Strategy Guerrilla Warfare" (Extremely Confidential, Reference Material Sui No. 6, compiled and printed by the Second Department of the Ministry of National Defense on January 30th, Republic of China Year 36), is a complete copy of the methods used by the Japanese bandits after 1942 for "Dare-to-Die Corps" and "Special Garrison Units." It mainly involves using armed special agents and secret agents in combination to carry out disguised surprise attacks, ambushes, assassinations, sabotage, and attacks on our local armed forces and local governments in enemy-held guerrilla areas or border areas, destroying our local organizations, and looting materials. The Chiang side admitted in the document that "the origin of the strategic warfare method is that during the War of Resistance, the enemy bandits suffered from the harassment of the guerrilla teams, so in September of the 32nd year of the Republic of China, the enemy's North China Special Garrison Unit successfully researched a countermeasure." The document stipulates that before implementing the "Pacification Strategy Guerrilla Warfare," each person must carry as much ammunition, lighting, three to five days of dry food, a set of civilian clothes (the style should be suitable for the environment of the combat area, and the quality should be old), and tools for disguise, such as farm tools, vehicles, etc." "After the action begins, all should change into civilian clothes, and weapons can be secretly transported by soil carts, horse carts, etc., in groups of three or five, and advance to the designated gathering point. When passing through cities, they should enter the city from different directions, but should try to avoid passing through cities and villages; the time of departure should be at dawn, the action should be at night, and during the day they can lie in ambush in sheltered places," and fight in the following ways, namely: "1. Encircling and ambushing (including simple ambushes and luring enemy ambushes), 3. Other strategic guerrilla warfare methods, namely: 1. Forming small groups of three to five people, often ambushing in villages infiltrated by bandit gangs or on their roads, to carry out shooting or capture; 2. Using strategic propaganda to restrain bandit gangs, so that they dare not abandon the villages they occupy, or lure them to our predetermined combat location, and then annihilate them; 3. For bandits who use tunnels to fight, they can first be chased into the tunnels, and then dig up the tunnels to attack them."

    The second document, "Operational Essentials in Areas Occupied by Bandit Gangs" (Extremely Confidential, Reference Material Sui No. 5, December of the 35th year, compiled and printed by the Second Department of the Ministry of National Defense), lists various methods such as inspecting residents and searching for materials and weapons. Not only is the method completely copied from the Japanese bandits' "sweep and tick-off essentials" (this document has been seized by us many times in the anti-sweeping operations after 1942), but also the writing style and format are no different. The examples cited are also facts from the Japanese bandits' sweeps of our Jin-Cha-Ji and Ji-Zhong areas during the War of Resistance, which shows that the document was indeed written by Japanese war criminals and regarded as a treasure by the Chiang army.

　　日寇屠杀人民办法
  　蒋贼悍然加以运用
    【本报特讯】最近我军在作战中缴获之蒋记国防部两项文件证明，蒋介石在请出日本侵华战犯冈村宁次作为其军事顾问，并直接令冈村参与其部队指挥，以屠杀中国人民之后；在战术方面亦完全继承了日寇的衣钵，提倡所谓“绥靖谋略游击战法”，“奸匪盘据地区内作战实施要领”等等在抗日战争中为解放区军民所深痛恶绝而屡予惨重打击的毒恶办法。
    其第一项文件：“绥靖谋略游击战法”（极机密，参考资料绥字第六号在民国三十六年一月三十日国防部第二厅编印），是完全抄袭了日寇在一九四二年以后“挺身队”、“特别警备队”所用的一套办法，主要是以武装特务与秘密特务结合进行化装奇袭、伏击、暗杀、破坏、打击我敌后游击区或边沿区之地方武装与地方政权，破坏我地方组织、抢劫物资。蒋方在文件内供认“谋略战法之来由，是抗战期间敌寇苦于奸匪游击队之滋扰，乃于民国卅二年九月由敌寇华北特别警备队研究成功的一种对策。”该项文件内规定在实施“绥靖谋略游击战法”之前，各人必须尽量携带足弹药、灯火，三至五日干粮，一套便衣（式样须适合作战地区环境，品质宜旧），及化装所用之工具，如农具车辆等”。“行动开始后，全部改着便衣，兵器可用土车、马车等秘密载运，三三两两，分组前进至规定地点集合。如通过城市时，应由不同之方向进城，但应尽量避免通过城市及村落；出动时间宜在拂晓，行动宜在夜间，日间可潜伏于荫蔽地点，”而以下列方式作战，即：“一、包围、伏击（包括单纯伏击与诱敌伏击），三、其他谋略游击战法，即：一、编成三至五名之小组数，常伏于奸匪潜入之村内或其通路旁，实施射击或捕捉；二、以谋略宣传牵制奸匪，使其不敢放弃所盘据之村落，或将其诱至我方预定作战地点后，再事歼灭；三、对于利用地道作战之匪，可先将其追入地道，再掘开地道攻击之。”
    其第二项文件：“奸匪盘据地区内作战实施要领”（极机密，参考资料绥字第五号，三十五年十二月国防部第二厅编印），则列举检查居民，搜查物资武器等各种办法，不但在方法上完全抄袭日寇的“扫荡抉剔要领”，（这一文件曾在四二年以后的反扫荡中为我多次缴获），而且在文法体裁上也并无二致。其中举例亦均系抗战期间日寇扫荡我晋察冀、冀中等地时之事实，足见该项文件确系出于日本战犯之手笔，而为蒋军奉为枭臬的。（政苍）
