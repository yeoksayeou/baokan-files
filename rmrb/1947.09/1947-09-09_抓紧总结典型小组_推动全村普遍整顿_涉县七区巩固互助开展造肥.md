　　Grasp Tightly the Summation of Model Groups
    Promote Universal Rectification in the Entire Village
  　Seventh District of She County Consolidates Mutual Aid and Develops Fertilizer Production
    [This newspaper, She County news] The Seventh District, amidst the tense hoeing of seedlings, is universally integrating rectification of mutual aid teams, the main methods being: on the basis of the original mutual aid, arrangements were made for current hoeing of seedlings and other aspects of life, and a movement was launched, then, during the movement, in-depth rectification of individual model teams was carried out. In villages with a mutual aid foundation, individual teams are summarized and rectified to promote universal rectification in the entire village; in villages with a poor mutual aid foundation, the main focus is on summarizing and rectifying individual good model teams to educate the masses to organize. The content of the rectification: mainly summarizing achievements and experiences to break the masses' confused ideas about mutual aid, promoting democracy, carrying out self-criticism movements, resolving all outstanding issues within the team, and truly achieving voluntary and democratic combination. In most villages in the district, mutual aid teams were dissolved and recombined once. After rectifying mutual aid, summarizing the production achievements of the first half of the year, and selecting models, a banner for getting rich was established, greatly stimulating the production enthusiasm of the masses, and the masses' thinking on getting rich became clear. For example, when the production achievements of the first half of the year were announced at a mass meeting in Taizhuang, and models were selected, Wei Shuangming said: "I didn't participate in mutual aid, so I have no fame or gain." Wei Meisu said: "I loafed in the mutual aid, harmed myself, didn't get any dividends, and even had to pay six catties of rice as a wage." Most of the masses reviewed and said: "Who knew that transportation would cost 1.4 million yuan this year? The cooperative often asks us to transport, and we even argue with them and don't want to go. From now on, we must listen." Zhang Jiuxiang's team in Dagang believed that mutual aid was a trick of the superiors, and they were just going through the motions for the convenience of business trips; after summarizing the production of the first half of the year, they finally realized that organizing is a good way to get rich. On the basis of such clear enrichment ideas, the masses are seizing the opportunity to implement equal exchange. Work points are universally used, and the method of "fixed division, flexible evaluation" is implemented. Taizhuang, Baichan, Dagang and other villages created a system of unified labor exchange and unified dividend distribution combining agriculture, sideline occupations, and wartime service, and seized the masses' enthusiasm for organizing, developing mutual aid teams in large numbers, from point to surface, from strongman teams to whole-family mutual aid, from mutual aid to mutual aid cooperatives. For example, Hougou developed from two teams to six teams, and all forty-one male laborers participated in mutual aid; in Taizhuang, Huaigeta, and Baichan, originally only men participated in mutual aid, but this time more than one hundred and eighty female laborers also joined the men's teams, and Wenhe and Baichan developed from mutual aid to ten small cooperatives. Baichan has six small cooperatives with shares of 380,000 yuan, earning 120,000 yuan in sideline occupations during seedling hoeing. Ninety-six percent of the households and eighty-three percent of the population in the district participated in mutual aid teams.
    Among them, ninety-six percent of the male laborers and seventy-four point three percent of the female laborers have been organized. From the broad scope and grand scale of the above organization, how to consolidate it regularly in the future is a very important issue. In terms of consolidation, the main measures taken by various villages are to use labor rationally in a planned and organized manner, to find various production avenues for the remaining labor force, to implement unified dividend distribution, to continue production according to the seasons, and to implement summary education to consolidate. For example, after the male laborers in Xijun hoed the first time, there were more than 600 mu left unhoed, so they organized eighty women and eleven old men to complete it, and ninety-one male laborers went to Pingshun to sell their labor, earning 990,000 yuan in twelve days. Huaigeta has a total of eighty-two laborers who went out to sell their labor for ten days, earning 436,000 yuan, and organized sixty women at home to hoe 100 mu of seedlings, plant seedlings in 475 mu, and reclaim 8.3 mu of wasteland. In the entire district, 364 people from eleven villages went out to sell their labor, earning a total of 640,000 yuan, and 667 female laborers and 64 semi-laborers worked at home, hoeing 138 mu of seedlings, planting 4014.7 mu, pulling 64 mu of turnips, and weeding 120 mu. Most of the sideline industry villages implemented the method of unified labor exchange and unified dividend distribution for agriculture and sideline industries, such as the unified labor exchange and four-layer dividend distribution for agriculture, sideline industries, and wartime service in Taizhuang. In Taizhuang, Hezhang, and Baichan, forty-four men and fifteen women were commended for their achievements in hoeing and pulling seedlings. After summarizing and consolidating, they immediately launched a manure making and firewood gathering campaign, gathering a total of 113,000 catties of firewood, cutting 250 loads of wormwood fertilizer, and collecting 600 loads of road fertilizer. The movement is currently underway. After rectifying mutual aid, there has been great development in the new leadership style of cadres. For example, Wei Hongzhang and Wei Changxun in Taizhuang used to only choose typical laggards and launch surprise (struggle) mass meetings to educate the masses. Because their style was not simple, the masses would hide when they saw the two of them, and everyone's work ability could not be brought into play. After rectifying mutual aid, they launched commendations, learned to go deep into work style, and promoted democratic leadership methods, praising the good and active aspects, improving everyone's morale, and promoting work. The director of the Taizhuang Women's Federation used to just talk without acting, but this time she took the lead in pulling seedlings, leading seven women to cross the river to pull seedlings; Feng Weishi in Hezhang, who used to be called "Talking Cadre" by others, now does every job first, leads everyone, and then talks. In general, cadres are learning to do it themselves first, and then promote it to everyone. Xu Taikuan in Xi＠ is an example of the new style. (Yuan Cun, Chun Fang, Yuan Dong)

　　抓紧总结典型小组
    推动全村普遍整顿
  　涉县七区巩固互助开展造肥
    【本报涉县讯】七区在紧张锄苗中，普遍结合进行整顿了互助组，主要方法：在原互助基础上按排布置了当前锄苗等生活，开展了运动，然后在运动中深入个别典型小组整顿。在有互助基础村，由个别组总结整顿，推动全村普遍整顿；在互助基础差的村，主要是总结整顿个别好的典型组，去教育群众组织起来。整顿内容：主要是总结成绩与经验，来打破群众对互助的糊涂观念，发扬民主，开展检讨运动，解决组内一切遗留问题，真正做到民主自愿结合。全区大部村庄，互助组解散重新结合了一次。经过整顿互助，总结前半年生产成绩，评选模范，树立了发家致富的旗帜，大大刺激了群众的生产情绪，群众的发家致富思想明确了。如台庄在群众大会上公布前半年生产成绩，评选模范时，魏双名说：“咱没参加互助没名没利。”魏美苏说：“咱在互助里偷懒，自己弄了自己，红利没分上，倒出了六斤工资米。”大部群众检讨说：“谁知今年运输会用一百四十万元，人家合作社经常叫去运输，还和人家抗嘴，不愿去，今后可要听话哩。”大港张九祥小组，认为互助起来是上级手腕，为了出差便利，便应付公事；经过总结前半年生产，终于认识了组织起来是发家致富的好门路。群众在这样明确发家致富的基础下，抓紧贯澈等价交换。普遍运用工票，实行死分活评办法。台庄、白芟、大港等村，创造组织起来农副业战勤三大结合统一变工统一分红制，并抓住群众要求组织起来的热劲，大量发展互助组，由点到面，由门头好汉组到全家互助，由互助到互助合作社大队。如后沟由两个小组发展到六个小组，四十一个男劳力全部参加了互助；台庄槐圪塔白芟原来是男人互助，这次一百八十余妇女劳力也参加了男人小组，温和白芟由互助发展到十个小型合作社，白芟六个小型社，股金三十八万元，在锄苗中的副业赚十二万元。全区百分之九十六的户数，百分之八十三的人口都参加了互助组。
    其中百分之九十六的男劳力，百分之七十四点三的女劳力都已组织起来。从以上组织起来面的广，规模的宏大来说，今后如何经常巩固起来，就是很重要的问题了。巩固上，各村主要采取了有计划有组织的合理使用劳力，给剩余劳力找各种生产门路，实行统一分红，不断按季节生产，实行总结教育来巩固。如西峻男劳力在家锄过头遍，剩下六百余亩没串，组织八十个妇女、十一个老汉来完成，九十一个男劳力到平顺卖工，十二天挣洋九十九万元。槐圪共八十二个劳力，出去卖工十天，挣四十三万六千元，组织起来六十个妇女在家锄苗一百亩，串苗四百七十五亩，灭荒八·三亩。全区十一个村出去卖工三百六十四个，共挣洋六十四万元，在家妇女劳力六百六十七个，半劳力六十四个，锄苗一百三十八亩，串地四千零十四亩七分，拔萝卜六十四亩，拔草一百二十亩。其副业村庄大部实行了农副业统一变工统一分红办法，如台庄农副战勤统一变工，四层分红。台庄、合漳、白芟三村锄苗拔苗立功的男四十四个，女十五个。经过总结更加巩固，紧接着开展了造粪打柴运动，共打柴十一万三千斤，割蒿粪二百五十担，沤路粪六百担，现运动正在开展。经过整顿互助，干部新的领导作风有很大发展，如台庄魏鸿章、魏常勋过去唯一领导方法是选择典型落后，大会突击（斗争），教育群众由于作风不单，群众看见他二人便躲起来，大家工作能力不能发挥，经过整顿互助开展了表模，学习了深入工作作风，发挥了民主领导方法，表扬好的、积极方面，提高大家情绪，推动工作。台庄妇会主任在先也是光说不动，这次拔苗中首起模范，带领七个妇女过河拔苗；合漳冯维世，先前别人叫他“说嘴干部”，现在每个工作先干，带领大家，然后再说，一般干部都学着自己先干，再去推动大家，西＠徐太宽就是新作风的榜样。（元存、春芳、元栋）
