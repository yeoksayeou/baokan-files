　　Wu'an's Hand-painted Posters and Banners
    Zhang Yiying
  　I. How These Posters Came to Be
    In the struggle, the farmers of Wu'an took out the "flag and umbrella escorts" from the landlords' homes. These things used to be used by the landlords for show during weddings and funerals. The boards were square, with the words "Silence" written on them. The flags were painted with dragons and looked quite majestic. Now, the farmers pasted their slogans, songs, rhythmic verses, and cartoons on them and spread them around the villages, turning them into "hand-painted posters" and "banners."
    In January 1946, the joint struggle in Chengnan Township in Wu'an opened up the situation, and the farmers won an initial victory. In order to unite their strength, Yehe Village in the Third District painted the eight oxen and various fruits seized from the big landlord Meng Linshan on the hand-painted poster. They also turned Meng Linshan's means of exploitation into a rhythmic verse and wrote it below. For example: "Meng Linshan is a living閻王, hiding a knife in his smile to kill the poor. His words are as sweet as honey, but he has knives and spears in his belly..." Tonghui Base Point also drew the 600 piculs of grain reduced in rent, bag by bag, on the poster, and wrote about the exploitation of Yue Wuchang by the landlord Yang Tiren, and the masses' slogans, such as: "With land in the village, set up boxes and cabinets, so that wives and children will not suffer. If you want to have a good time, you have to hold another struggle meeting. How the landlord eats, let him spit it out. Drive the landlords into the temples. Don't be afraid of being hit on the head by a fan, don't be afraid of being flooded when crossing the river. Unite, and our strength will be great, and we will overthrow the big tyrant! Going to Guandong or Henan is not as good as making suggestions through struggle!" etc. They beat gongs and drums and spread the word in the base point villages. Wherever these posters and banners were carried, the masses followed. This is how the hand-painted posters and banners came to be.
    II. Read What Others Have, Write Your Own – A Constant Flow to Promote Work
    After the posters were created, they were sent from the base point villages to the surrounding villages. After arriving in a village, they were handed over to the village's propaganda department, which was led by the Party branch secretary or propaganda committee member, and which included various heroic models from the land reform production movement and primary school teachers who volunteered (six to eight people). The village propaganda department read the posters, extracted the materials, and was responsible for spreading them to the masses. After discussion by everyone, the primary school teachers wrote the drafts and pasted them up as well. In this way, the work of their own village was passed on from village to village, and then back to the base point village. The base point village then extracted the important information and passed it on to the county office. In this constant flow, the work of a base point village was greatly promoted.
    III. As Soon as the Hand-painted Poster Arrives in the Village, It Is Broadcast Immediately
    The hand-painted posters and banners have become base point newspapers. Currently, the whole county is paying attention to this matter. As soon as the hand-painted poster arrives in a village, the village's blackboard newspaper and loudspeaker broadcasting station immediately use the time of the farmers' association meeting to disseminate the information on the hand-painted poster. In this way, it is very flexible and timely. The hand-painted poster is like a news agency, sending manuscripts to the blackboard newspapers and broadcasting stations in each village.

　　武安的板报与旗报
    张一英
  　一、这报怎办起来的
    武安农民在斗争中，把地主家里的“旗伞执事”都拿出来了，这些东西，过去是地主们过红白喜事摆架子用的，板是方形，写有肃静字样，旗上则画着龙，颇为威风，而今农民把自己的口号、歌子、快板、漫画贴上去，在村子里传起来，成了“板报”与“旗报”了。
    四六年正月，武安城南乡联合斗争轰开了局面，农民获得了初步胜利，为了联合力量，三区野河村把斗争大地主孟林善的八条牛及各种果实画在板报上面，又把孟林善剥削人的手段，编成快板，写在下面。如：孟林善活阎王，笑里藏刀杀穷人，说出话来甜如密，肚子里边有刀枪……，同会基点也把减租六百石粮一布袋一布袋画在上面，还写着，地主杨体仁剥削岳五昌的事情，和群众的口号，如：有了庄子地，摆下箱子柜，孩子老婆不受罪，若要过好时光还要再开斗争会，地主怎样吃，让他怎样吐，把地主赶在庙里头，打破头不怕扇子扇，过河不怕大水淹，联合起来力量大，斗倒大恶霸！走关东下河南，不如斗争提意见！等……。他们打着锣鼓，在基点村传，这种报扛到那里，群众便跟到那里，板报和旗报，就这样办起来了。
    二、看了人家的，写上自己的，川流不息，推动工作。
    这报办起来以后，从基点村出发，沿村转送，到村后交给村里的宣传部，那宣传部是支书或宣委领导的，吸收翻身生产运动中的各种英雄模范参加，小学教员义务教员参加（六人至八人），村宣传部看了，把材料摘录下来，负责传到群众里去，又经大家讨论，由小学教员执笔写成稿子也贴上去，如此把自己村里的工作一个村一个村的传过去，又转回基点村，基点村再把重要的摘录下去，转到县办公室里去，如此川流不息，一个基点村的工作便很好的推动起来了。
    三、板报一到村里，马上便广播出去了。
    板报、旗报成了基点报，目前全县里都注意起这件事了，板报一到村里，各村的黑板报、喇叭广播台，马上便利用农会开会的时间把板报上的东西传播出去，这样，非常灵活、及时，板报好象通讯社，向各村的黑板报、广播台发稿了。
