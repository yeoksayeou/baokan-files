[This report from the Jilu豫 [Jilu Yu] region:] In the Zhuxian review movement, the union of poor and rich villages to "fight tigers and eat meat together" has become the demand of all poor peasants. Ni Guantun in the first district is a rich village, but the land in the surrounding villages of Ni Guan, Zhang Bingtang, Qie Mazhuang, Chenzhuang, and more than ten other villages largely belong to the landlords of Ni Guantun. Therefore, many tenants in these villages are very poor. When the masses studied how the landlords of Ni Guantun became wealthy, some older people could even point out which land originally belonged to tenants from which villages before they gave it to the landlords. Even the poor peasants of Ni Guantun village said: Our village landlords really got rich by exploiting the outside villages. The landlords dug soil from us and the poor peasants in the outside villages, digging us all into big pits and small pits, and then using that soil to build a high mound in Ni Guantun. Now, it’s time to flatten this high mound and fill the pits from where the soil was dug. Fill the big pits more, and the small pits less. Also, the villages surrounding Liu Daozhi village are mostly small, poor villages. The poor peasants of Lühutong and Zhangmu villages, which have no landlords, said: The land of the landlords in the north and east of Liu Daozhi village was mostly taken from our two villages. In the past, most of us in these two villages were debtors to the landlords of Liu Daozhi. The principal generated interest, and the interest generated more principal, and in the end, they took our land. Therefore, the masses in the poor villages demanded a joint struggle with the rich villages to divide the fruits of victory. Secondly, the poor peasants in the rich villages also made the same demand. Because they feel their own strength is too small to form a force on their own, it is difficult to firmly unite with the middle peasants to fight the landlords. For example, in Liu Daozhi village in the first district, there are only less than ten poor peasant families out of more than one hundred households. In the past, it was a puppet stronghold, with strong feudal forces. It has always been a blank slate village, specializing in creating clan conflicts with other villages and opposing joint struggles. But this time, the poor peasants in the village unanimously demanded to unite with other villages. They said: The more united poor peasants there are, the greater the strength will be. Then we can fight the landlords, and the middle peasants will no longer rely on the landlords and look down on us. Wang Si, a poor peasant in Haizi village in the sixth district, because he was looked down upon in his own village, he went to Guandi Temple, Wu Tang, Xiao Zhuang, and Li Zhuang to unite more than fifty poor peasant households and formed a three-review committee, forming a large independent force. The regimes of the five villages were also taken over, and a joint administrative village was established. The branch was also merged into one, with unified plans, unified actions, and unified distribution of the fruits of victory. However, some cadres are afraid to unite poor and rich villages, fearing clan conflicts, believing that the majority of the masses in rich villages do not want to unite. Facts have proven that although clan conflicts have occurred in the past in joint struggles between poor and rich villages, that only happened when the middle peasants were under the control of the landlords. For the poor peasants, uniting is exactly what they demand. Now, each district is boldly supporting them, letting the masses discuss freely, establishing poor peasant backbones, and launching a joint review movement of ("fight tigers and eat meat together") in a planned manner according to the demands of the poor peasants to solve the problems between poor and rich villages.

　　联合斗争是贫农要求
  　筑先贫富村团结大复查
    【本报冀鲁豫八日电】筑先复查运动中，穷富村联合，同打虎，同吃肉。成为全体贫农的要求。一区倪官屯，是个富村，但周围倪官、张炳堂、茄马庄、陈庄等十余村的土地，大都是倪官屯地主的。因此这一带村庄，当佃户的很多都很穷，群众研究倪官屯地主怎样发家的，有些上年纪的人还可能指出那些地原是那庄佃户变给地主的，连倪官屯本村的贫农都说：俺村地主真是剥削外村发的家，地主在俺身上和在外庄贫农身上挖了土，把俺们都挖成了大坑小坑，挖到倪官屯来培成一个高＠堆。现在就该把这个高＠堆铲平，把从那里挖来的土，再填到那里去，大坑多填，小坑少填。又刘道之村周围，也多是小穷村，吕胡同张幕两村都没有地主，这两村的贫农说：刘道之村北村东地主的土地，很多是要的俺两庄的，俺两庄过去大部分都当过刘道之地主的债户。本添利，利添本，结果把地都拿去了。因此贫村的群众，要求与富村联合斗争，分果实。其次，富村的贫农，也同样的这样要求。因为他们嫌自己力量太小，不能单独形成力量，就难去坚定与团结中农斗地主。象一区刘道之村，一百多户，贫农不到十家。过去是伪据点，封建势力很强，始终是白板村，专门与外村闹宗派矛盾，反对联合斗争，但这次村里贫农，一致要求与外村联合，他们说：联合的贫农越多，力量就越大，那就能与地主干，中农就不再靠着地主，瞧不起俺了。六区海子村贫农汪四，因本村看不起他，于是他到关帝庙、吴堂、小庄、李庄联合贫农五十多户，成立三复查委员会，形成了一个大的独立力量，五个庄的政权，也都接收过来，建立起联合行政村，支部也合成一个，统一计划，统一行动，统一分果实，但有部分干部不敢使贫富村联合，害怕闹宗派矛盾，认为富村的大多数群众不愿意联合，事实证明，过去在贫富村联合斗争中，虽闹过宗派矛盾，但那只是中农在地主掌握之下，才发生的，对于贫农，联合起来正是他们的要求，现在各区正大胆撑腰，放手让群众讨论，树立贫农骨干，有计划的根据贫农要求，开展（同打虎，同吃肉）的联合复查运动，解决贫富村问题。
