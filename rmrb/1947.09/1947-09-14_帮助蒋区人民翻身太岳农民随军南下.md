Taiyue Peasants Join the Army to Go South to Help People in Chiang Areas Overturn Their Lives

[This newspaper, Taiyue, 13th dispatch] From Jincheng, Yangcheng, Yicheng, Xiangling and other ten counties, there are tens of thousands of peasants' expedition teams and stretcher teams who have turned over a new leaf, following Chen Geng's army south across the south bank of the Yellow River. When the news of the expedition across the river reached Shangge Village in Qinshui, Wang Shiguang, a farmhand by birth, was eating. He quickly took his meal to the village office and registered as the first one. He said, "We must work hard to climb to the top of the mountain and eliminate Chiang Kai-shek." After speaking, he turned around and mobilized Guo Zhongxian and Li Chunming. The boatmen along the Qin River crossings, after receiving this news, wanted to show their skills on the Yellow River and send the army across the river. The boatmen of Hetou and Liushan villages in Yangcheng, in order to ensure the army's successful crossing, specially went to the People's Hospital in the city to check their physical condition and selected 36 qualified boatmen. Wei Lieyuan bought thousands of yuan worth of medicines (prepared for temporary illnesses). Daxu Village in Jiyuan originally planned to mobilize 15 people to participate in the war and cross the river, but as soon as it was proposed, 20 people signed up, wanting to fight across the river. In Quwo, an old man, already in his sixties, signed up three times to fight across the river. He said, "I have turned over a new leaf, I cannot but help the people on the south bank to turn over a new leaf!" But he was finally rejected. But he still said, "I am old, but my legs are still fast and my eyes are still bright, I can't cook a meal!" More than 3,000 people in Jincheng jointly signed a meritorious service guarantee before departing to the front line: resolutely complete the task and return after winning the battle. Pan Shunhe of the Yangcheng famous militia hero Ye Mingzhu Company confidently proposed, "I was a meritorious person in the Jinan Campaign, and I will also strive to be a model squad in the Henan Campaign!" This huge team that has turned over a new leaf is marching mightily towards the south of the Yellow River. Just passing through a certain place in Yangcheng took two days and two nights. Along the way, they also received the welcome and send-off from the people everywhere. Everyone said, "This is our victorious army!" On August 14th, when some people passed the Dahe River in Pingtou Village, Yangcheng, the river water surged. Zhang Deshun, the village chief of Pingtou Village, mobilized the boatmen in the village, a total of 38 people, to help the participating team cross the river. It took three full days. Among them, three Gaoping militiamen refused to let the boatmen send them. They were washed away by the flood after walking less than twenty steps. At this time, the boatmen Zhang Renyi, Zhang Yongquan, and others quickly jumped to the river bank and rescued them from the backwater. When the Gaoping militiamen offered money, the boatmen flatly refused, saying, "We are also doing it to defeat Chiang Kai-shek. You are making contributions on the front line, and we are making contributions on the water." Now they have victoriously crossed the Yellow River and are fighting side by side with the troops.

    【本报太岳十三日电】晋城、阳城、翼城，襄陵等十县，有×万翻身农民远征队、担架队，相随陈赓大军南征黄河南岸，在过河远征消息传到沁水上阁村时，雇农出身的王世官，正在吃饭，连忙端着饭去到村公所，报了第一名，他说：“要努力爬上山顶，消灭蒋介石”，说完，又转身去动员了郭忠贤、李春明。沿沁河各渡口的水手，在得到这一消息后，要在黄河上一献身手，送大军过河。阳城河头、刘善两村的水手，为了保证部队胜利过河，特别到城内人民医院检查体格、挑选合格的卅六名水手，魏烈远买数千元药品（准备临时生病用的），济源大许村原计划上号召十五人参战过河，谁知刚提出来，就有二十人报名，要打过河去，曲沃有一个老汉，已经六十多岁，三次报名要打过河去，他说：“我翻了身，我不能不帮助南岸人翻身”！可是终于被拒绝了。但他还在说：“我年纪大，可是腿还快、眼还明，不能作个饭！”晋城三千余人，在出发前线时，共同立下立功保证书：坚决完成任务，打胜仗回来。阳城著名民兵英雄夜明珠连的潘顺合，很有把握的提出来，“在晋南战役中当了功臣，在河南战役中同样要争个模范班！”这支巨大的翻身队伍，浩浩荡荡，向黄江南去，仅在阳城某地经过就走了两天两夜，沿路上他们同样得到了各地人民的欢迎与欢送，大家说：“这就是咱们的胜利军！”八月十四日，有些人经过阳城坪头村的大河时，河水暴涨，坪头村长张德顺就把村里的水手动员起来，共计三十八人，帮助参战队过河，整整三天，其中有三个高平民兵，不让水手送，走不到二十步远，就被暴水冲走了，这时水手张仁一、张永全等，眼急腿快跳到河岸上，回水头去救了出来。高平民兵给钱时，水手一口谢绝了，并说：“我们也是为了打败蒋介石，你们在前线立功，我们在水上立功”：现在他们已胜利的渡过了黄河，与部队并肩战斗着。
