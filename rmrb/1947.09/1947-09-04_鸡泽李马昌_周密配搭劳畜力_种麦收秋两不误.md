	Careful Coordination of Labor and Animal Power
	Ensures Both Wheat Planting and Autumn Harvest
	[Our News Team, 2nd dispatch] Farmers in Li Machang Village, Jize County, are actively preparing for wheat planting in response to the County Committee's call to plant wheat. Villagers unanimously agree that the biggest challenges this year are the lack of fertilizer and animal power. The village is currently discussing how to overcome these difficulties. The mutual aid team led by Labor Hero Chang Dongtang has a total of over 2.6 hectares of land, with 1.06 hectares dedicated to wheat planting. The team has 2.5 units of animal power, each capable of plowing and harrowing an average of 0.2 hectares per day. At this rate, it would take 20 days to complete the 1.06 hectares of wheat land. Team members felt that "this year, just plowing and harrowing will delay the wheat planting." The final solution agreed upon was: (1) To combine wheat planting with the autumn harvest. During the autumn harvest, all animal power would be dedicated to plowing, and another animal would be purchased. This would allow them to plow and harrow each field once in 15 days, finishing 8 days ahead of schedule. (2) Women and children would be recruited to participate in the autumn harvest, with male laborers only doing heavy work (such as transportation, pulling sorghum stalks, and corn). The remaining male laborers would form teams to pull seed drills, and the children's corps would pull rollers (leaving the animal power completely free). This way, they could sow 1.3 hectares per day, completing the task in eight days. After this discussion, Li Hongchang happily said, "I was worried about not having enough animals, but with this plan, I don't have to worry anymore!" During the discussion of fertilizer, everyone agreed that this was the most difficult problem. Hero Chang Dongtang, who is planting over 2 hectares of wheat, currently has only seven cartloads of manure. At half a cartload per 0.067 hectares, he can only fertilize 0.93 hectares. He cannot figure out how to fertilize the remaining 1.07 hectares. He calculated that buying fertilizer would cost too much money. He can only rely mainly on women and children to start an intensive green manure composting campaign. With over twenty days left before wheat planting, there is still time to compost green manure. Male laborers will also participate in manure accumulation during their remaining time, ensuring that each person accumulates one large cartload. (Zhu Bo)

	[Our News Team, 1st dispatch] "If it rains during the hottest days of summer, plant more wheat." The masses in Jize County are seizing this favorable condition, preparing for wheat planting in a tense but happy atmosphere. The County Committee called on the entire county to plant wheat on 60% of the arable land, with each person striving to plant 0.2 hectares and harvest 25 kilograms of wheat next year. Farmers are taking advantage of the half-month break before the autumn harvest to plow and sun the land (reserved for wheat). The entire county has already plowed the land more than twice, and the early autumn crops have been weeded four times, while the late autumn crops have been weeded three times. Farmers are responding to the Party's call by adding another weeding, which not only benefits the autumn crops but also retains moisture in the soil, making it easier to plant wheat. Farmers call this "nourishing the soil." In the plains, the autumn harvest and wheat planting are often intertwined. This year, there are many late seedlings, and if not organized well, it will affect wheat planting. Villages are actively reorganizing mutual aid teams and organizing labor, paying special attention to "recruiting women and children to rush the autumn harvest" and "cut a piece when it's ripe." After plowing a piece of land once and harrowing it twice, wheat can be planted immediately. The two major difficulties in planting wheat in the county are gradually being resolved. First, the lack of fertilizer. It is estimated that the existing manure is only one-third of what it was before the Anti-Japanese War, averaging less than half a large cartload per 0.067 hectares. The leadership has put forward the slogan "Each person accumulate one large cartload of manure," mobilizing the masses to dig more manure pits. Before the autumn harvest, when women and children are not busy, they are also mobilized and organized to become the main force in manure accumulation. Elementary schools are dismissing students early, instructing children to sweep street soil and collect dirty objects to put into the manure pits, which will then become fertilizer. Second, there are too few cattle. The existing number of cattle has not yet reached "one cow per 6.7 hectares," which is still half of what it was before the war. The leadership is calling on mutual aid teams planting 4 hectares of wheat to add a cow, mainly relying on everyone pooling their money to buy them. Banks will also issue large loans to help farmers. There is currently a concern about adding cattle. The reason is the lack of fodder. There is a shortage of fuel in the plains, and much of the grain straw is burned as firewood. The leadership is making every effort to build cooperatives, preparing to transport coal in large quantities after the autumn harvest to support farmers and free up grain straw specifically for feeding cattle. Farmers are very excited about this plan and are actively pooling shares to buy cattle. It is estimated that the county can add thousands of cattle before the end of the year. (Li Zhuang)

　　鸡泽李马昌
  　周密配搭劳畜力
  　种麦收秋两不误
    【本报记者团二日电】鸡泽李马昌村农民，响应县委会种麦号召，积极准备种麦工作。该村农民一致认为：今年种麦最困难的问题是缺肥料和畜力。日前全村正进行关于克服上述困难的讨论，劳动英雄常东堂亲自领导的互助组，共两顷六十余亩地，一顷五十九亩均种麦。全组共两个半畜力，每个畜力平均每天犁耙各三亩，一顷五十九亩麦地，需要二十天才能完成，组员都感觉到“今年光犁耙地就把种麦时间耽误过去了”。最后，讨论克服的办法：（一）种麦秋收结合进行。秋收中畜力完全腾出来犁地，另外再买一个牲口。这样十五天即可犁耙各一遍，提前八天完成。（二）吸收妇女儿童参加秋收，男劳力仅做一些重活（如运输、拔高梁秸、玉茭等），剩出男劳力合伙拉耧，组织儿童团拉砘子（畜力可完全剩余出来），每天能耩二十亩，八天即可耩完。经过这样讨论后，喜的李洪昌说：“我光为没有牲口上愁，这么一算计，可不发愁了。”最后讨论肥料问题时，大家认为这是最困难的问题。英雄常东堂种三十多亩麦子现在才有七车粪，每亩以半车粪计算，才能上十四亩麦地，其余十六亩麦地想不出办法来。他计算买肥料用钱太多，只能以妇女儿童为主，突击沤青肥。目前距种麦还有二十余天，沤青肥还来的及，男劳动力抽剩余时间也参加积肥，保证每人积一大车。（朱波）
    【本报记者团一日电】“伏天有雨多种麦”，鸡泽群众抓紧这个有利条件，紧张而愉快的进行种麦准备。县委号召全县百分之六十的耕地种上麦子，每人争取种三亩，明年收麦五大斗。农民们乘着秋忙以前半个月的间隙，赶犁晒地（留麦地）。现全县晒地都已犁过两遍以上，早秋已锄过四遍，晚秋亦已锄过三遍。农民们即响应党的号召，又开始加锄一遍，不但有利秋禾，且可保留地中水分，便利种麦，农民称之为“养垧”。平原秋收与种麦常常搅在一起，今年晚苗又多，如组织不好，将会影响种麦。各村现正积极整顿互助、组织劳力，特别注意“吸收妇女儿童抢秋”“黄一块，割一块”。在＠地上犁一遍，耙两遍后，马上即可种麦子。该县种麦的两大困难，正逐步解决中。第一，肥料缺乏。据估计，现有粪土，只相当抗战前的三分之一，每亩平均不到半大车粪，领导上提出“每人积粪一大车”的口号，发动群众多挖粪坑，秋收前妇女儿童不忙，也动员组织她们成为积肥主力，各小学提早放学，领导儿童扫街土，拾脏物投于粪坑，即成肥料。第二，耕牛太少，现有耕牛尚未达到“顷地一牛”，比战前仍少二分之一。领导上号召种六十亩麦地的互助组，添到一牛，主要依靠大家伙买，银行亦将发放大批贷款，帮助农民。现在对于添牛，有个顾虑。原因是缺乏草料，平原燃料缺乏，许多谷草都被当作柴火烧了，领导上正多方建设合作社，准备于秋后大批运煤，支援农民，腾出谷草，专作喂牛之用，农民听到这个计划，情绪极高，纷纷集股购买，估计年前全县可添牛千头。（李庄）
