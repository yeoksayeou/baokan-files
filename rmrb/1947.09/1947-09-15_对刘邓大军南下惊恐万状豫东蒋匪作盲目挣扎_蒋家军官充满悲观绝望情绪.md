Xinhua News Agency, Central China Front, August 20th: (Delayed) After Liu and Deng's army crossed the Yellow River and repeatedly annihilated Jiang's troops, the Jiang's military and political forces in eastern Henan were terrified and frantically increased troop conscription and grain levies in an attempt to save the critical situation. In Guocun Town, Shangqiu County (the county has a total of 200 "bao" units), six soldiers were conscripted in June, seven in July, and as many as seventeen in August. In Ningling County, 20 soldiers were conscripted from each "bao" at the end of July. In Xiangcheng, Huaiyang and other places, one must bring one's own gun to be conscripted. The tricks of Jiang's conscription are endless. The Jiang's county governments of Shangqiu and Ningling ordered the people to send grain to the city within a time limit. As soon as the grain was unloaded, the grain senders and carts were all arrested. In mid-July, 800 to 900 audience members were arrested at once in the new theater in Shangqiu city. Jiang's bandits also sneaked into the liberated areas of Zhecheng to surround villages and arrest all the young and middle-aged people. In Bogang, Xiaowuji and other villages, 10 to 50 people were arrested each time. There is no limit to the amount of grain and money apportioned by the Jiang's military and political forces. Before the first installment is paid, the second one is levied. The military police who are urging the payment of grain and money point their guns at the people and say, "As long as the Eighth Route Army does not come, you will have to pay every day." Recently, when Jiang's military and political organs conscript troops and apportion grain, they require the people to pay cash in lieu of soldiers and grain. The people are talking: Jiang's bandits are terrified when they hear that Liu and Deng's army is advancing south. They want cash so they can take it with them when they flee. The people of eastern Henan are already full of anger at this brutal crime. They say, "The Liberation Army has begun its counter-offensive. What are we waiting for? Shouldn't we rise up quickly?"

Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 13th: Li Tiemin, division commander of the 1st Division of the 42nd Army of Jiang's army, Li Huaide, regimental commander of the 1st Regiment, and Zheng Shude, regimental commander of the 3rd Regiment, who were captured by us in the Ye Ting City (Yancheng) battle, told reporters about their training in the Nanjing Jiang's Army Officer Training Corps. They all said that most of the trainees were defeated generals from various battlefields, full of pessimism and decadence. When discussing how to deal with the mobile warfare of the Liberation Army, everyone was helpless, saying: "The National Army does not cooperate, the intelligence is unclear, the masses do not support us, reinforcements are not available, and morale is low, while the Communist Army is the opposite, which is really difficult to deal with." In the end, the chairman of the meeting could not make a summary, and only said humorously: "In short, the strengths of the Communist Army are the weaknesses of our army. If we take its strengths and make up for our weaknesses, we can win." Everyone couldn't help but smile wryly. Jiang also repeatedly emphasized in his many speeches: "Learn from the enemy (referring to the Liberation Army) the advantages to eliminate the enemy." Therefore, the entire officer training corps discussed the advantages of the Liberation Army. Senior officers who had been in contact with the Liberation Army were invited to speak at the group meetings, but later they thought, "It's too good to talk about the Communist Army and shake the morale of the army," so important officials of the Ministry of National Defense stood up to reprimand them. But in the end, it was concluded that the Communist Army has many advantages, but there is no way to "learn from the enemy". When discussing how to improve morale, the officers listed insurmountable difficulties such as the soldiers' (referring to Jiang's army) malnutrition, mental decadence, the wounded and sick could not be cured, rewards and punishments were unclear, they were afraid of death in battle, and generally officers wanted to retire and return home, and bad politics affected the military. For this reason, the Ministry of National Defense had to issue a paper-based solution: if the soldiers' life is hard and their morale is low, it is stipulated that: "The division commander should approach the soldiers once a month, the regimental commander should approach them once a week, the battalion commander should approach them every two days, and the company commander must approach the soldiers every day." Another way to avoid being annihilated is: "It is not allowed to break through, it is not allowed to rely on foreign aid, and we must independently and autonomously die for the Party, and so on. But before long, Li Tiemin, Li Huaide and others who had been trained became prisoners of the Liberation Army with their entire division in Ye Ting City.

　　对刘邓大军南下惊恐万状豫东蒋匪作盲目挣扎
  　蒋家军官充满悲观绝望情绪
    【新华社中原前线八月二十日电】（迟到）刘邓大军南渡黄河迭歼蒋匪后，豫东蒋匪军政惊慌万状，更加疯狂的派兵抓丁及征收粮款，企图挽救危局，商邱县郭村镇第十保（该县共二百保）六月份派兵六名，七月份七名，八月份竟又派十七名之多。宁陵县七月底每保一次派兵二十名，项城、淮阳等地派一个兵还要自带一支枪。蒋匪抓丁的花样更是层出不穷，商邱、宁陵蒋匪县府，勒令民众限期到城关送粮，粮食刚刚倒下，送粮人和粮车一齐被抓走了。七月中旬，在商邱城内新戏院子一次就捉走了观众八九百人。蒋匪并窜到柘城解放区围住村庄把所有青壮年都抓走，在伯岗、小吴集等村每次捉走十余人到五十余人不等。蒋匪军政摊派的粮款就没有数目，头一次的没缴完，第二次的又派来了。催粮逼款的军警拿枪对着老百姓说：“八路军一天不来，你们就得缴一天。”蒋匪军政机关在最近抓兵派粮都要老百姓交现款顶丁顶粮。老百姓纷纷议论：蒋匪听到刘邓大军南渡，个个提心吊胆，他们要了现款，这是预备逃跑的时候好带走，豫东人民对此残暴罪行，早已满怀怒火，他们说：“解放军开始反攻了，咱老百姓不赶快起来干还等啥时候？”
    【新华社华中十三日电】叶挺城（盐城）战役为我生俘之蒋四十二集团军一师师长李铁民、一团团长李怀德、三团团长郑树德等与记者谈及他们在南京蒋记军官训练团受训情形时，咸称：大部受训学员为各战场败将，充满悲观颓丧情绪，在讨论如何应付解放军运动战时，大家都没有办法，说：“国军不配合，情报不明，群众不拥护，增援不上，士气低落，而共军则一切相反，实难应付。”最后会议主席也作不出总结来，仅滑稽地说：“总之共军的长处就是我军的短处，取其所长，补我所短，则可以制胜。”全体不禁哑然失笑。蒋在屡次训话中亦再三强调：“学习敌人（按指解放军）优点去消灭敌人。”于是整个军官训练团都讨论起解放军的优点来了，凡和解放军接触过的高级军官都在小组会上被邀讲话，但后来又认为：“把共军讲得太好了动摇军心，”因而国防部要员又起而申斥。可是讨论到最后还是共军优点甚多，至于如何“学习敌人”则苦无办法。在讨论如何提高士气时，军官们列举士兵（按指蒋军）营养不良，精神颓废，伤病员不能治愈，赏罚不明，临阵怕死，一般军官都想解甲还乡，及政治不良，影响军事等等无法克服困难。为此，国防部只得颁布了一个纸上空文的解决办法：如士兵生活苦，士气不振，则规定：“师长每月接近士兵一次，团长每星期接近一次，营长每两天一次，连长则须天天与士兵接近。”再如避免被歼的办法是：“不准突围，不能依靠外援，要独立自主的死守党等等。但是曾几何时，受过训的李铁民、李怀德等即与其全师人马在叶挺城作了解放军的俘虏。
