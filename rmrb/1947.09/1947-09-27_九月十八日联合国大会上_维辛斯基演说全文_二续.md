    The Greek Question

    The first question is the question of the threat to the independence and territorial integrity of Greece. The full discussion of this question should be reserved for the General Assembly to hold a discussion in accordance with the established procedures. The Soviet delegation believes it is only necessary to point out that there is no basis for raising this question. The accusations made by the American delegation against Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and Albania are completely arbitrary and without any evidence. These accusations go even further than the conclusions of the majority of the United Nations Greece investigation team, to the extent that they did not receive the support of nearly half of the members of the investigation team. Moreover, as long as one examines the figures on which these conclusions are based with a little more seriousness, these accusations cannot withstand any criticism. It is not difficult to prove that the report of the majority of the Greek investigation team on the so-called Greek question is full of contradictions and vulgar distortions, which renders the conclusions of this majority meaningless.

    The Korean Question

    As for Korea, Mr. Marshall presented the question in such an arbitrary and erroneous manner, claiming that the lack of results in the work of the Soviet-American Joint Committee on Korea was the responsibility of the Soviet side, and proposed suggestions that obviously violated the Moscow Agreement on the Korean issue reached by the three foreign ministers in December 1945, which stipulated that the United States and the Soviet Union were jointly responsible for preparing to resolve the issue of unifying Korea into an independent democratic state. Mr. Marshall's new proposal violates the obligations undertaken by the United States and is therefore erroneous and unacceptable. Instead of abiding by the Moscow Agreement on Korea and taking steps to implement the methods stipulated in the agreement, and then submitting these methods to the joint discussion of the United States, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and China, the US government prefers to violate its own obligations and attempts to use the prestige of the United Nations General Assembly to cover up its unilateral and absolutely unjust actions. The Soviet Union cannot agree to this violation of the aforementioned agreement on Korea and will insist on rejecting Mr. Marshall's proposal, which is completely contrary to the obligations undertaken under the Three-Power Agreement on Korea.

    The Interim Committee's Proposals

    Now, let's talk about the issue of the Interim Committee that "constantly pays attention to the work of the General Assembly" and decides on "permanent" affairs. Mr. Marshall proposed the establishment of a permanent committee of the United Nations General Assembly under the name of the Interim Committee on "Peace and Security." Despite the reservation in the American proposal that the committee should not discuss issues that should mainly be discussed by the Security Council and special committees, the proposal raises suspicions that the attempt to establish an interim committee is nothing more than a poorly disguised attempt to replace the Security Council and circumvent the Security Council. The committee's power to review situations and disputes that undermine friendly relations is none other than the power specifically stipulated for the Security Council in Article 34 of the United Nations Charter. For this reason alone, the transfer of these powers to any other body (regardless of the name of this body) would inevitably and directly violate the United Nations Charter. The Soviet delegation cannot agree to this and will resolutely oppose it. I repeat, if the American delegation submits the above-mentioned new proposals or old proposals in disguise requesting the United Nations General Assembly to review them, the Soviet delegation is willing to reserve the right to make a more detailed analysis of these proposals when these issues are actually discussed, and will insist on rejecting these proposals, believing that this is contrary to the main purposes and objectives of the United Nations, and accepting these proposals can only undermine the very foundation of the United Nations itself.

    Soviet Proposal Opposing Propaganda for a New War

    The Soviet delegation believes it is necessary to submit to the General Assembly the issue of measures against propaganda for a new war, which is of great importance. More than two years have passed since the United Nations Charter was signed in San Francisco and subsequently ratified by fifty-two countries. It marked the beginning of the activities of the new international federation. This organization set itself the task of ensuring peace and security for all countries and developing and strengthening international cooperation to assist the economic and social progress of all countries. Tracing back to the time when the United Nations Organization was established, it was precisely when the main enemy of the democratic countries—Hitler's Germany—had been defeated, and Japan's defeat was approaching. The attempt of these public enemies of mankind to establish world hegemony suffered a complete failure. This was the result of the historic victory of the democratic countries, led by the alliance of Britain, the Soviet Union, and the United States. The two traditional hotbeds of war have been destroyed, and we hope to be sure that they are destroyed forever, to be sure that the task of completely disarming Germany and Japan will be thoroughly completed, and that these countries will no longer threaten the freedom-loving countries with war and aggression. We hope to be certain that the aggressor countries have learned the severe lessons of the past World War II, and that these lessons are by no means meaningless. Moreover, the fate of the aggressors who suffered severe punishment in the last war will indeed become a terrible warning to those people who, regardless of their guarantees to promote friendly relations among countries and strengthen peace and security throughout the world, are secretly or openly preparing for a new war. The war hysteria, stirred up by the efforts of certain countries, first and foremost the military and expansionist elements in the United States, is constantly expanding and becoming increasingly threatening. Newspapers (mostly American and those countries that obediently follow the United States—such as Turkey) are already conducting a frantic propaganda offensive, the purpose of which is to influence world opinion to support the war. All instruments of psychological pressure, such as newspapers, magazines, radio, and movies, are being used for this purpose.

    The United States Vigorously Promotes a New War as an Excuse for Expansion Plans

    This propaganda for a new war is being carried out under various and ever-changing slogans and excuses. However, no matter how different these slogans and excuses may be, the essence of all the propaganda is only one, namely, to use this as an excuse for the mad race of American armaments (including atomic weapons), and as an excuse for the unrestricted efforts of the powerful groups in the United States to implement expansion plans (permeated with the same ideas as the past world hegemonies). American newspapers are doing their utmost to preach a new war and demand that the people prepare for a new war as effectively and as early as possible. A large number of newspapers and magazines (mostly American) clamor for a new war every day, systematically imposing this decadent and degenerate psychological pressure on public opinion in these countries. The warmongers are conducting this propaganda under the guise of strengthening national defense forces and opposing the danger of war (which is said to be "threatening them" from some countries). Propagandists and warmongers are doing their utmost to use all means to scare the politically ill-informed people with the myth and vicious fiction about the so-called Soviet Union's preparations to attack the United States. Undoubtedly, they are fully aware that they are lying. The Soviet Union has no intention of attacking any country. The Soviet Union is using all its strength for the post-war reconstruction work in the war-torn areas and in the border areas generally damaged by the war, as well as for the work of restoring and further developing its national economy. The propagandists and warmongers who are active in the United States, Turkey, Greece, and certain other countries clearly know that in the Soviet Union, the people there—workers, peasants, and intellectuals—unanimously condemn all attempts to provoke a new war. Indeed, in the Soviet Union, in a country that is engaged in peaceful construction work, concentrating on peaceful labor, and devoting great efforts to the restoration of the devastated areas and the strengthening and further development of its national economy, which was damaged by the heavy blows of the war imposed on the Soviet Union by the Hitler bandits, it is completely impossible to prepare for war.

    九月十八日联合国大会上
    维辛斯基演说全文  二续
    希腊问题
    第一个问题是对希腊的独立和领土完整之威胁的问题。这个问题的充分讨论，当留待大会照既定程序举行讨论的时候。苏联代表团认为只需指出：提出这个问题是没有任何根据的。美国代表团所提出的对南斯拉夫、保加利亚和阿尔巴尼亚的攻击是完全武断和没有任何证据的。这些谴责比联合国希腊问题调查团大多数的结论还更进一步，以至得不到该调查团近一半团员的支持。而且只要稍为认真查查这些结论所根据的数字的话，这些谴责，就经不起任何批评。不难证明，希腊调查团大多数对所谓希腊问题的报告是充满了矛盾和粗俗的歪曲，使这大多数的结论失去了任何意义。
    朝鲜问题
    至于朝鲜，马歇尔先生这样十分武断与错误地提出问题，竟说朝鲜苏美联合委员会工作的无结果责在苏方，并且提出显然违反一九四五年十二月三外长对朝鲜问题所达成的莫斯科协定，该协议规定美苏两国共同负责准备解决统一朝鲜为一独立民主国家的问题。马歇尔先生的新建议是违反美国所担任的义务，因此是谬误而不能接受的。美国政府不是遵守莫斯科关于朝鲜的协定，采取步骤以实现该协定所规定的办法，然后将这些办法交与美、苏、英、中四国共同讨论，美国政府不这样做，却宁愿违背本身的义务，并企图以联合国大会的威信来掩护它片面的、绝对不公正的行动。苏联不能同意这种对上述关于朝鲜的协定之违背，并将坚持拒绝完全与根据三强朝鲜问题协定所担任的义务背道而驰的马歇尔先生的建议。
    临委会的建议
    现在讲到“经常注意大会工作”，并决定“永久性”事务的临时委员会问题。马歇尔先生建议以“和平与安全”临时委员会的名义设立一个联合国大会常驻委员会。尽管美国建议中有这样的保留：该委员会不得讨论主要应由安理会与特别委员会负责讨论的问题，但是该建议引起了这样的怀疑，即成立临时委员会的企图不是别的，只是拙劣伪装的、代替安理会和避开安理会的企图而已。该委员会审查损害友好关系的情势和争端的职权，也不是别的，正是联合国宪章第三十四条所特别规定的安理会的职权。单就这一理由，这些职权如果转移给其他任何机构（不管这机构的名称是什么），就必然明显而直接地违反联合国宪章。苏联代表团对此是一定无法同意的，并且要坚决反对的。我再说一遍，假若美国代表将上述新建议或改头换面的旧建议提出要求联合国大会来审议，苏联代表团愿意保留权利，当这些问题作实际讨论时再对这些建议作更详细的分析，并且将坚持拒斥这些建议，认为这与联合国的主要宗旨与目的背驰，接受了这些建议只能破坏联合国本身的基础。
    苏联建议反对新战争宣传
    苏联代表团认为有必要向大会提出关于反对新战争宣传底措施这一具有巨大重要性底问题，这种宣传在若干国家正在加强进行中。自从联合国宪章在旧金山签字，随后又经五十二国批准以来，两年多的时光已经消逝了。它标志了新国际联合会活动的开端。这个组织给自己规定的任务，是保证各国和平与安全及发展与加强国际合作，以协助各国的经济与社会进步。追溯联合国组织成立的当儿，正是民主国家的主要敌人——希特勒德国——已被击溃，日本的失败已经接近的时候，这些人类公敌想建立世界霸权底企图遭受彻底的失败，这是以英、苏、美联盟为首的民主国家底历史性胜利的结果。两个传统的战争策源地已经摧毁了，我们希望能够确定它们是永远被摧毁了，确定完全解除德、日武装的任务将被澈底完成，而这些国家将不致再以战争与侵略来威胁爱好自由的国家。我们希望能够确定：侵略各国在过去的第二次大战中所学到的严酷教训，确非毫无意义的。而且，在上次战争中遭受严厉惩罚的侵略者的命运，确将成为对于那些人们的可怖警告，那些人不顾他们所承担的促进各国的友好关系和加强全世界和平与安全的保证，秘密或公开地进行新战争的准备。某些国家首先是美国的军阀及扩张主义分子的努力所煽起的战争歇斯底里病，还在不断地扩张，而且愈来愈具有威胁性了。报纸（大部分是美国的以及那些驯顺地跟在美国后面的国家——例如土耳其）早已在进行疯狂的宣传攻势，其目的则在影响世界舆论去赞助战争。一切具有心理压力的工具，例如报纸、杂志、无线电与电影都正被利用着进行这一目的的活动。
    美国极力宣传新战争作为扩张计划的借口
    这种新战争的宣传正在各种各样变化百出的口号与借口下进行着。可是，不管这些口号和借口如何的不同，全部宣传的本质却只有一个，即以此作为在美国军备（包括弹子武器）的疯狂竞赛的借口，作为使美国有势力集团无限制地力图实行扩张计划（浸透着与过去世界霸权的同一思想）的借口。美国报纸用尽气力宣讲新战争，并要求人民尽量有效和尽量早地去准备应付新战争。很大一部分报纸与杂志（多数是美国的）天天叫嚣新战争，有计划地把这种腐朽堕落的心理压力加诸于各该国的舆论。战争贩子们进行这种宣传，这是在加强国防力量及反对战争危险（据说有些国家“威胁着他们”）的叫嚣底伪装下进行的。宣传家与战争贩子竭力使用一切方法，以关于所谓苏联准备进攻美国的神话和恶毒的虚构去吓唬那些政治上消息很不灵通的人民。毫无疑义，他们十分清楚知道：他们是在说谎。苏联决没有打算进攻任何国家，苏联正把所有力量用在战争破坏地区及一般地受到战争损害的边疆的善后工作，以及恢复和进一步发展它的国民经济的工作上。在美国以及土耳其、希腊和某些其他国家中活跃的宣传家与战争贩子们清楚知道，在苏联，那里的人民——工人、农民及知识分子都一致谴责挑起新战争的一切企图。真的，在苏联，在从事于和平建设工作，聚精会神从事于和平劳动，把大力用之于被破坏地区的恢复工作及加强并进一步发展其因希特勒匪徒强加于苏联的战争之沉重打击而损伤了的国民经济的国家中，准备战争那是完全不可能的。（待三续）
