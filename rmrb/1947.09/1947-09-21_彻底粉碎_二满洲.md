    Zhou Baozhong, a general who persisted in the Northeast Anti-Japanese War for fourteen years and is now the chairman of the Jilin Province Democratic Government, wrote this article for Xinhua News Agency on the 16th anniversary of the "September 18th" Incident.
    On September 18, 1931, Japanese fascists opened fire on the Chinese people in Shenyang. The traitorous government of Chiang Kai-shek, adhering to a policy of surrender, issued a no-resistance order, and the rivers and mountains of the Northeast quickly changed color. But Chiang Kai-shek, whose traitorous crimes surpassed those of Qin Hui and Wu Sangui, even dared to shamelessly advocate "internal pacification before resisting foreign aggression," and even issued orders: "Those who speak of resisting Japan will be killed." At this time, Chiang Kai-shek intensified his attacks on the People's Red Army, which advocated resisting Japan, and massively arrested patriotic youths who were unarmed, plunging the people of the Northeast into the miserable and dark plight of becoming slaves in a completely colonized territory. However, the people of the Northeast were unwilling to be subjugated people. As soon as the September 18th Incident occurred, they violated Chiang Kai-shek's surrender and no-resistance policy, and under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, spontaneously rose up to resist Japan. In Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces, they organized youth volunteer armies and peasant guerrillas, launched the uprising of the National Salvation Army in the Yanbian area, and mobilized workers, peasants, and educated youth, causing the Liaoning People's Self-Defense Army to expand rapidly. However, it is painful to say that in the early stages of the development of the anti-Japanese movement in the Northeast, the Kuomintang reactionaries were afraid of the growth and strengthening of the people's anti-Japanese armed forces. Therefore, they colluded with the Japanese invaders, playing the role of spies in the anti-Japanese camp, paralyzing and softening the then-burning anti-Japanese national salvation struggle. Due to the despicable and treacherous behavior of the Kuomintang reactionaries, more than 300,000 Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army soldiers were dispersed by 50,000 Japanese troops centered on the Domon Division. Many Kuomintang members mixed in the anti-Japanese ranks, such as Ma Zhanshan, Ding Chao, and Sun Chaoyang, openly surrendered and became high-ranking officials in the puppet Manchuria. Others absconded with huge sums of money, most notably Ma Guobin, the nephew of Wan Fulin; some led large numbers of troops to flee to Xinjiang and the interior, abandoning the anti-Japanese camp.
    Although the Kuomintang reactionaries used various methods to undermine the anti-Japanese movement of the people of the Northeast, and the Chiang government continued to sell out the anti-Japanese war in Rehe, concluded the Tanggu Truce, and sold out North China, isolating the anti-Japanese struggle in the Northeast from the interior, this only aroused deeper resentment among the people of the Northeast against Chiang Kai-shek and his then master – the Japanese invaders. On the contrary, the spirit of the Chinese Communists sacrificing and struggling for national survival, and their advocacy of resisting Japan and saving the country, gained greater faith among the broad masses. In 1933, the Northeast Organization of the Communist Party of China accepted the famous "January 26th" instruction. All Party members and members of the Communist Youth League in the Northeast stood on the side of the people, persisted in resisting Japan and saving the country, created people's armed forces, implemented an anti-Japanese united front, and were determined to carry out a long-term guerrilla war. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, various parts of the Northeast formed vast mass local organizations – Anti-Japanese National Salvation Associations. In southern Manchuria, the Panshi Guerrilla Force – the First Army of the People's Revolutionary Army – was formed; in Yanbian, the East Manchuria Guerrilla Force – the Second Army of the People's Revolutionary Army – was formed; in eastern Jilin, the Anti-Japanese Allied Army, centered on the Ning'an Guerrilla Force, was formed; and on the basis of the Rehe Guerrilla Force, the Third Army of the People's Revolutionary Army was formed. In 1934, the Kou Shan Guerrilla Force was used as the backbone to form the Fourth Army of the Anti-Japanese Allied Army; the Jidong Allied Army was reorganized into the Fifth Army of the Anti-Japanese Allied Army; the Tangyuan Guerrilla Force was reorganized into the Sixth Army; and the Raohu Guerrilla Force was reorganized into the Seventh Army. These armies were completely under the consolidated leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, and the composition of the combatants was also improved. The sons and daughters of workers and peasants with a high degree of national consciousness actively participated. Seventy to eighty percent of the Anti-Japanese Allied Army's sharp light and heavy weapons were seized from the Japanese invaders in battle. Not only were they equipped with infantry, but they also had a large number of cavalry and a certain number of artillery, appearing and growing with a brand-new posture. The characteristics of such anti-Japanese armed forces were: relying on the masses, protecting the interests of the masses, having strong organization, strict discipline, brave fighting, and skillful guerrilla tactics. The reckless Japanese invaders, deeply celebrating that they had obtained the help of the Kuomintang and that they had eliminated the anti-Japanese army based on the old army, thought that nothing would happen from then on and shouted the slogan of "establishing a Wangdao Paradise in Manchuria." But from that time on, from the triangular zone of the Changbai Mountains in the south, across the old eastern border road, north to both sides of the Mudanjiang and Songhua Rivers, and east to the left bank of the Wusuli River, including sixty-nine counties, the Japanese invading army was subjected to increasingly heavy blows from the people's anti-Japanese army every day and every night. The wilderness of the Northeast abandoned thousands and thousands of white bones of the Japanese invading army every year, and loyalty towers of the "Imperial Army" were erected everywhere. These all reflected the great struggle of the Chinese people for national survival and exposed the symbol of the inevitable death of the Japanese invaders. The "August 1st" Declaration issued by the Chinese Communist Party in 1935 further enhanced the confidence of the people of the Northeast in resisting Japan, and at the same time, it received the support of the Chinese Armed Self-Defense Committee and patriotic organizations and patriotic people in the interior. The strength of the Northeast people's resistance to Japan was further strengthened, and the organization and leadership of the Anti-Japanese Allied Army were unified into eleven armies and one independent division in terms of establishment. In order to meet the incident, in accordance with the instructions of the CPC Central Committee on July 5, 1936, the Anti-Japanese Allied Army was reorganized into three armies to determine three aspects of guerrilla warfare in order to more effectively contain and attack the Japanese invaders when they launched a large-scale invasion of the interior. In 1936 and 1937, the vanguard troops of the First Route Army crossed the South Manchuria Line and attacked western Liaoning, crossing the Yalu River and Tumen River four times and attacking eastern Korea, causing unexpected blows to the Japanese invaders. The Third Route Army crossed the Lesser Khingan Mountains to the west and opened up guerrilla warfare on the Heilongjiang Plain. The Western Expedition Army of the Second Route Army entered and exited eastern Harbin, shaking Jilin, Changchun, and Harbin. Just as the Japanese invaders clamored, it turned the Three Rivers Province of the Japanese invaders into a "Communist Paradise." When the July 7th War broke out, the puppet Manchurian army, awed by the prestige of the Anti-Japanese Allied Army, and the puppet army's 18th, 21st, 22nd, 28th, 36th, and 38th regiments, as well as the "Jingan Army" and "Police Brigades," etc., rebelled in whole battalions and divisions in the puppet Tonghua Province and puppet Sanjiang Province to resist Japan, making the Japanese invaders exhausted and increasing their losses. However, due to Chiang Kai-shek's passive resistance after July 7th and repeated failures, the Japanese invaders were still able to concentrate a large number of troops in the Northeast, which affected the arduous struggle of the people of the Northeast. From 1931 to 1933, the Japanese regular army invading the Northeast was 50,000, while from 1934 to 1937 it increased to 400,000, from 1937 to 1938 it was 500,000, from 1939 to 1941 it was 700,000, and from 1942 to 1944 it increased to 33 army corps and 14 mixed brigades, totaling 1 million. The increasing number of Japanese troops year by year shows the difficult environment of the Northeast people's anti-Japanese struggle. After 1938, the Japanese invaders adopted increasingly severe rape, murder, arson, looting, consolidation of villages, strengthening of walls, and clearing of fields, turning thousands of miles of rural areas into barren land. In such a difficult situation, the Communists and the backbone troops of the Anti-Japanese Allied Army still adhered to the banner of resisting Japan and saving the country with national integrity and the glory and pride of the Communists, in the icy and snowy conditions and when ammunition and food were exhausted. In 1944, when the Japanese invaders were carrying out the so-called "Trans-Continental Operation" and Chiang Kai-shek was lingering behind Wang Jingwei, the Northeast Anti-Japanese Allied Army still launched guerrilla warfare in the lower reaches of the Songhua River and the Nenjiang Plain, constantly carrying out short-term attacks to strike the Japanese invaders.
    When the Soviet Union declared war on Japan and the Red Army sent troops to the Northeast, the CPC organized and led the Anti-Japanese Allied Army to mobilize the people everywhere to strike the Japanese invaders, coordinate with the Red Army in combat, and join forces with the Eighth Route Army and New Fourth Army troops that came to Rehe and eastern Hebei to eliminate the remaining Japanese and puppet forces in the Northeast, collect the hidden armed forces of the Japanese and puppets, and form the people's own soldiers of the Northeast – the Democratic Allied Army, to shoulder a new historical mission.
    The above ironclad historical evidence fully shows that in the fourteen years after the fall of the Northeast, only the Communists and the Anti-Japanese Allied Army endured hardships, were brave and outstanding, and persisted in the anti-Japanese struggle; only they were the saviors of the suffering people of the Northeast. However, the great traitor and great national traitor Chiang Kai-shek's fascist clique, who handed over the beautiful rivers and mountains of the Northeast to the enemy, attempted to "receive" the so-called "sovereignty" from the people of the Northeast after "August 15th." They inherited the mantle of Japanese and puppet rule, used American weapons and aircraft to harass and bomb the people of the Northeast everywhere, intensified the implementation of the puppet Manchurian baojia system, joint responsibility, special agents, conscription, dispatch of laborers, and various economic plunders, corruption, and exorbitant taxes, turning the Chiang-occupied areas of the Northeast into a "second Manchuria" that everyone cursed.
    Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the people of the Northeast carried out land reform, achieved true liberation politically and economically, and had a reliable and powerful armed Democratic Allied Army. We are determined to work with the liberated areas and the People's Liberation Army throughout the country to completely eliminate all Chiang troops invading the Northeast, completely crush the second Manchuria in the Chiang-occupied areas, and strive for the victory of the patriotic land protection and self-defense war in the entire Northeast.

    彻底粉碎“二满洲”
    周保中
    按：周保中将军坚持东北抗日战争十四年，现任民主政府吉林省主席。本文系于“九一八”十六周年纪念日特为新华社而作。
    一九三一年九一八，日本法西斯在沈阳向中国人民开炮了。而蒋介石卖国政府抱定投降政策，颁布不抵抗命令，东北河山很快的全部改色。但卖国罪恶超过秦桧、吴三桂的蒋介石，竟敢又下贱无耻的倡言：“攘外必先安内”，甚至下命令：“言抗日者杀”。此时蒋介石一面加紧进攻主张抗日的人民红军，一面大肆捕杀赤手空拳的爱国志士青年，使东北人民陷入完全殖民地化的奴隶牛马的悲惨黑暗的苦境。但是，东北人民不愿做亡国奴，九一八事变一开始，就违反着蒋介石的投降和不抵抗的卖国政策，在中国共产党领导下，自动奋起抗日，在吉黑两省组织了青年义勇军和农民游击队，发动了延边一带的救国军起义，动员了工农群众和知识青年，使辽宁民众自卫军迅速扩大。然而说来令人痛心，在东北抗日运动发展的初期，国民党反动分子就害怕人民抗日武装的成长壮大，于是他们就与日寇勾结，在抗日营垒里起着奸细的破坏作用，麻痹和软化当时正在燃烧着的抗日救国斗争。由于国民党反动分子这种卑鄙的叛卖行为，三十余万的东北抗日义勇军，遂为以多门师团为中心的日寇军五万人所击散。许多混在抗日队伍里的国民党分子，如马占山、丁超、孙朝阳等并公开投降，成为伪满洲国的达官显贵。其他则有的卷骗巨款潜逃，最显著的如万福麟的外甥马国宾；有些率领大批队伍相率逃往新疆和内地，脱离抗日阵营。
    虽然国民党反动分子用各种方式破坏东北人民的抗日运动，蒋政府又复继续出卖了热河的抗战，订结塘沽协定，出卖华北，使东北抗日斗争与内地相隔绝。但这只能引起东北人民对蒋介石及其当时主人——日寇更深的愤恨。相反的，中国共产党人为民族争生存而牺牲奋斗的精神，与抗日救国的主张，在广大群众中获得更高的信仰。一九三三年中共东北组织接受了著名的“一二六”指示，东北全体党团员，站在人民方面，坚持抗战救国，创造人民武装，实行抗日统一战线，决心进行长期游击战争。东北各地在中共领导下，组成广大群众的地方组织——抗日救国会。在南满编成了磐石游击队——人民革命军第一军，在延边组成东满游击队——人民革命军第二军；在吉东组成了以宁安游击队为中心的抗日同盟军，在热河游击队的基础上编成人民革命军第三军；一九三四年以寇山游击队为骨干编成抗联第四军；把吉东同盟军编为抗联第五军；汤源游击队编为第六军；饶虎游击队编成第七军。这些军队完全获得中国共产党的巩固领导，战斗员的成份也改善了，有高度民族自觉的工农子弟都积极的参加。抗联犀利的轻重武器，十之七八是在战斗中自日寇手中夺来。不但装备有步兵，而且有大量的骑兵和一定数量的炮兵，以崭新的姿态出现和成长。这样的抗日武装，其特点为：依靠群众，保护群众利益，组织坚强，纪律严整，作战勇敢，有巧妙的游击队战术。鲁莽的日寇，深庆得到国民党的帮助，在他们消灭了以旧军队为基础的抗日军之后，以为从此无事，便喊出了“建立满洲国王道乐土”的口号。但是从那时开始，南起长白山脉的三角地带，横过旧东边道，北到牡丹江、松花江两岸，东达乌苏里河左岸，包括六十九个县份，日寇侵略军每天每夜受到人民抗日军所给与的越来越重的打击。东北原野年年抛弃着日本侵略军的上千累万白骨，遍地树立起“皇军”的忠灵塔，这都是反映着中国人民为民族争生存的伟大斗争，暴露着日寇侵略者的必趋死亡的象征。一九三五年中共发表的“八、一”宣言，更增强了东北人民抗战的信心，同时得到中国武装自卫委员会及内地爱国团体爱国志士的赞助。东北人民抗日的力量更见加强了，在建制上统一了，抗日联军的组织领导编成十一个军和一个独立师。为了迎接事变，依照中共中央一九三六年七月五日的指示，把抗联各军分编为三个路军，确定三个方面的游击作战，以便在日寇大举侵略内地时，更有力的牵制日寇，打击日寇。一九三六到三七两年，一路军的挺进部队，曾过南满线，进击辽西，先后四次渡过鸭绿江、图门江，袭入鲜东，使日寇遭受意外打击。三路军越过了小兴安岭西，开辟了黑龙江平原的游击，二路军的西征军进出哈东，震撼了吉长和哈尔滨。正象日寇所叫嚣的一样，使日寇三江省变为“共党乐士”。当七七抗战爆发前后，伪满军慑于抗联的声威，伪军十八、二十一、二十二、二十八、三十六、三十八各团及“靖安军”“警察大队”等，在伪三江省伪通化省区，整营整师的起义反戈抗日，使日寇疲于奔命，加重其损失。但由于蒋介石七七后之消极抗战，步步失败，使日寇仍能大量集中兵力于东北，影响了东北人民的艰苦斗争。一九三一到三三年侵略东北的日本正规军为五万人，而一九三四到三七年更增加到四十万人，一九三七到三八年为五十万人，一九三九到四一年为七十万人，一九四二到四四年增加到三十三个兵团、十四个混成旅，为百万人。就日军逐年增加的数目字，就可以说明东北人民抗日斗争的艰苦环境。一九三八年以后日寇采取了越来越厉害的奸淫烧杀抢掠，归屯并户、坚壁清野，几千里农村变为一片荒土。就在这样的艰难局面下，共产党人和抗联的基干部队，依然以民族气节，与共产党人的光荣自豪自励，在冰天雪地、弹尽粮绝的情况中，坚持着抗日救国的旗帜。一九四四年当日寇进行所谓“横贯大陆作战”，蒋介石正徘徊于汪精卫幕后的时候，东北抗联仍展开了松江下游与嫩江平原的游击战，不断的作短促攻袭，以打击日寇。
    到了苏联对日宣战，红军出兵东北，中共组织领导着抗联，到处发动人民打击日寇，武装配合红军作战，并与来到热河和冀东的八路军部队新四军部队会师，肃清东北日伪残余，收缴日伪潜伏的武装，编成了东北人民的子弟兵——民主联军，担负起新的历史使命。
    以上这些历史的铁证，充分说明东北沦陷后的十四年中，只有共产党人和抗日联军含苦茹辛，英勇卓绝，坚持着抗日斗争；只有他们是苦难的东北人民的救星。但是将东北大好山河拱手让敌人的大汉奸大卖国贼的蒋介石法西斯集团，却于“八一五”后企图从东北人民手中“接收”所谓“主权”。他们继承了日伪统治的衣钵，使用美械、美机，对东北人民到处袭扰轰炸，变本加厉的实行伪满的保甲、连坐、特务、抓壮丁、派劳工、施行各种经济掠夺，贪污腐化，横征暴敛，把东北蒋占区变成人人痛骂的“二满洲”。
    东北人民在中国共产党领导之下，实行了土地改革，得到了政治上经济上的真正翻身，并且有了可靠的强大的武装民主联军，我们坚决与全国解放区和解放军一起，誓必彻底消灭进犯东北的全部蒋军，彻底粉碎蒋占区的二满洲，争取全东北爱国保田自卫战争的胜利。
