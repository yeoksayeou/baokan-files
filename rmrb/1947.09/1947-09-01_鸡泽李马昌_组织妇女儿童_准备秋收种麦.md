Jize Li Machang

	Organizes Women and Children to Prepare for Autumn Harvest and Wheat Planting

	[Our correspondent reported from Handan on the 30th] The peasants of Li Machang in Jize are paying special attention to absorbing women and children to participate in the autumn harvest and wheat planting, in order to solve the difficulty of labor shortage. Li Machang Village has a total of 3,170 mu of land and 541 people, of which only 84 are male full laborers and 63 are male half laborers. On average, each laborer has to harvest and plant nearly 30 mu of land (including those on business trips). Bu Dongtang, the labor hero of the village, led his group and calculated that it would take 26 days to complete the autumn harvest, which would definitely affect the wheat planting. Everyone was panicked. Li Hongchang said: "If we only harvest the autumn crops, we won't be able to plant wheat (meaning we won't be able to manage it)!" Chang Dongtang patiently led everyone in a detailed discussion and found that mobilizing women and children to participate in the autumn harvest could solve the difficulties (women do light work, planting millet, sowing seeds, and trimming sorghum heads, which is equivalent to one male full laborer). The group has a total of 13 female full laborers. If everyone is mobilized to participate, the autumn harvest can be completed in eight days. At this time, everyone's enthusiasm was raised. Li Wensheng said: "Last year, Li Jun's five mu of corn was plowed by others, but he still hadn't finished harvesting it, and he didn't plant wheat; this year, if we don't help each other and don't let women participate, who knows when we'll finish harvesting!"

	[Our newspaper reported from Taiyue on the 30th] In order to implement the great production policy, Qinshui County held a meeting of cadres from all systems from the 5th to the 20th of this month to summarize and check the work of this period. Due to the county-wide campaign of labor hero Wang Sanguan and the promotion of experience created by the county and district work teams in Longquan, Wangjiayuan, Han Hong and other base points, 191 administrative villages in the county have generally organized mutual aid groups. 12,550 male full laborers have been organized, accounting for 68.6 percent, and 8,509 half laborers have been organized, accounting for 44.5 percent. 20,775 female full laborers have been organized, accounting for 38.5 percent. Due to such a comprehensive implementation of organization, the third hoeing has been generally completed. Of the 98,352 mu of millet and corn land in the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth districts, 70,977 mu have been hoeed three times (statistics at the end of July). However, among these mutual aid groups, only 18 villages such as Longquan and Caiyanyuan have relatively sound systems of free combination, labor rating, and work point tickets. In order to consolidate mutual aid and production in the future, the meeting decided to continue to carry out the Wang Sanguan campaign to overcome formal mutual aid and consolidate one group at a time. Before the autumn harvest, a grass cutting campaign should be launched, requiring each village to cut all the grass within five li of the field edges. Each male full laborer should strive to cut 10,000 jin, and half laborers 5,000 jin. Secondly, expand the area of wheat land and do not waste any mature land. When the autumn harvest comes, harvest a piece as it ripens. Also, prepare firewood to light fires to avoid frost when frost occurs.

  　组织妇女儿童  准备秋收种麦
    【本报记者图卅日电】鸡泽李马昌农民准备秋收种麦时，特别注意吸收妇女儿童参加，解决劳力缺乏的困难。李马昌村共三千一百七十亩地，五百四十一口人，其中仅有八十四个男整劳动力，六十三个男半劳动力，平均每个劳动力要收种近三十亩地（出差的在内）。该村劳动英雄部东堂领导他组经过具体计算，需要二十六天才能收完秋，一定要影响种麦。大家都着了慌。李洪昌说：“光收秋吧，麦子不要种啦（意思顾不过来啦）！”常东堂耐心的领导大家细细讨论，发现动员妇女儿童参加秋收，可以解决困难（妇女做轻活，种谷子、点种、削高梁头，顶一个男整劳力）。该组共有十三个女整劳动力，如全体动员参加，秋收八天即可完成。这时大家情绪提高了，李文生说：“去年李俊的五亩玉茭，别人都犁过来了，他还没有收完，麦子就没有种上；今年要不互助，不叫妇女参加，说不定啥时才收割完哩！”（朱波）
    【本报太岳三十日电】沁源为贯澈大生产方针，本月五日至二十日，召开全县各系统干部会议，总结检查这一时期工作，由于全县开展了劳动英雄王三官运动，及县区工作组在龙泉、王家园、韩洪等基点创造经验的推动，全县一百九十一个行政村，普遍的组织起互助组，一万二千五百五十个男全劳力已组织起百分之六十八点六，半劳力八千五百零九人，组织起百分之四十四点五，妇女全劳力二万零七百七十五人，组织起百分之卅八点五。由于这样的全面的实行了组织起来，普遍作到锄三遍，三、四、五、六区总共谷、玉茭地九万八千三百五十二亩中，锄过三遍的就有七万零九百七十七亩（七月底统计）。但在这些互助组中，能自由结合，按劳力评分，工差票制度比较健全的，则只有龙泉、猜宴园等十八个村。在今后巩固互助及生产上，会议决定，继续开展王三官运动，克服形式的互助，要组织一个，巩固一个。秋收前要开展割蒿运动，要求各村把五里以内地边的蒿都割尽，男全劳力每人争取割一万斤，半劳力五千斤。其次是扩大麦地面积，不荒一分熟荒，到秋收时，熟一块，收一块。并准备下柴火，以备遇霜时点火避霜。
