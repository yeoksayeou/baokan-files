Lessons from the Collapse of the Xiaotun Mutual Aid Group
    Zhang Zhen

    The mutual aid organizations in areas like Qiuxian County were once very well-known in both Qiuxian County and the Fourth District. They were prominently reported in the newspapers in the past; however, for two years, people have stopped mentioning them because they have collapsed! In the spring of 1944, Sun Xingjia's transportation team returned to the village and responded to the government's call by organizing two long-term labor teams and several short-term labor teams. They jointly plowed their own land and ate government grain (the district determined Xiaotun to be the key village for disaster relief in the entire district). At this time, the masses of Xiaotun knew that "whoever participates in mutual aid plowing will be loaned grain to eat." All five mutual aid groups adopted the method of "exchanging land" for work. The group did not calculate work points, and after plowing the land, they would report to the village office to receive grain. At that time, in order to satisfy their hunger, no one would complain about taking a loss or advantage. Even if there was some unfairness, the masses would forgive it, saying, "Our village is poor, and the district is giving us special consideration!" After the autumn harvest, the village bought seven oxen, some bought by the long-term and short-term labor teams, and some bought by landlords and rich peasants. At the county labor hero conference, Sun Xingjia was selected as the top labor hero in the county and was awarded a top-quality ox.

    In the winter, the entire district launched a land redemption and democratic struggle, but the leadership still determined that Xiaotun should implement the mutual aid policy. At this time, every farmer in Xiaotun had questions in their mind—"Whoever does not participate in mutual aid is an independent operator," and "Our village will not engage in struggle!" Although the masses felt that attending meetings was troublesome, no one could say anything because not participating in mutual aid would make them an "independent operator." Landlord Sun Fengde saw that the struggles in other villages were very fierce and thought that he would inevitably be struggled against sooner or later, so he "voluntarily" took out ten sacks of grain and handed them over to the village office, attempting to ease the masses' demands for struggle. Not two days later, the village spread the word that "whoever participates in mutual aid can eat grain."

    In the spring of 1945, Xiaotun established a power organization—the Mutual Aid Cooperative, with five mutual aid brigades under it. The organization committee member of the cooperative was the landlord Sun Fengde, Sun Xingjia became the head of the cooperative, and Sun Jiayan was the inspection committee member, all concurrently serving as brigade leaders. At this time, there was a shortage of oxen, and the demand for human-powered mutual aid was very urgent. The entire village was divided into seventeen mutual aid groups. After the establishment of the Mutual Aid Cooperative, the group leaders would go to the cooperative every night to record accounts. After the Labor Mutual Aid Cooperative was established, Sun Xingjia led his group to Liu Zhigu, more than ten li away from Xiaotun, to reclaim wasteland for three days, bringing their own food and seeds, planting without compensation. Even now, the people of Liu Zhigu often say, "If it weren't for Sun Mazi from Xiaotun, we would have starved to death."

    Later, the Second District was merged into the First District, and the county committee cadres left this base point village. Chen Shan, the accountant of the Labor Cooperative, was also transferred to teach at Panguanzhai. From then on, the masses discussed in small groups, and some said, "We've worked for nothing for two years, and we still don't understand!" Some said, "The work points earned can only be sold to cadres for half the price, and they still don't want them!" Chen Zhiqing said to everyone he met, "I owe one work point, and the cooperative couldn't wait a moment, they absolutely had to have it. I worked as a long-term laborer, but no one asked about it. I wanted to sell my one thousand yuan work point to the cooperative for five hundred yuan, but they didn't want it!" Some said, "If we get an ox to work for us for one day, we can't repay them even in two days." Some said, "Cadres don't work, and their land isn't barren!" Under these circumstances, the Xiaotun Mutual Aid Cooperative collapsed.

    The Xiaotun Mutual Aid Cooperative existed for more than two years from its establishment to its collapse. Why did it suddenly collapse? The main reason was that the masses demanded mutual aid during the disaster. The leadership also paid attention to helping Xiaotun do a good job in mutual aid. While other villages were engaged in struggle, Xiaotun was focused on production. Landlords and rich peasants grasped the leadership, and the cooperative head Sun Xingjia became a simple task executor. Landlords set the price of oxen labor particularly high, and poor peasants universally reflected that "Households with oxen would have their land weeded first before our own land could be weeded when owing labor to others!” The poor peasants suffered too much. Once the disaster passed and the poor peasants realized that this was an endless cycle of losses, they were unwilling to engage in mutual aid. A few cadres took advantage of the situation, causing disunity and dividing into factions. Upright cadres were envied, while a few cadres with incorrect and coercive work styles thrived, such as Chen Shanyan as accountant, only managing the finances himself, while the members cultivated all of his land.

    This year, the leadership started to rectify again in July. After two months of reorganization, seven mutual aid groups were reorganized based on the voluntary combination of the masses, including thirty-eight full laborers and fifteen oxen. Two groups were opened to grind flour, and one group to gin cotton. After several months of mutual aid and increased production, seventy-one more manure pits have been dug, and the whole village has accumulated 432 cartloads of manure and 338 cartloads of grass manure. The original nineteen oxen have increased to twenty-one, the original nine pigs have increased to twenty-three, and the original seven sheep have increased to thirty. The leadership is educating the masses with the reasons for the past collapse, and the mutual aid groups are now being reorganized and expanded.

    小屯互助垮台的教训
    张贞
    邱县等地的互助组织，在邱县和四分区都曾经是非常响亮的，报纸上过去很突出的报导过它；但是二年以来，人们再不提起它们因为已垮台了！三十三年春，孙兴甲动输队回村后，响应了政府的号召，组织了两个长工队，数个短工队，合伙犁自己的地，吃政府的粮食（区上确定小屯为全区的救灾重点村），这时小屯的群众都知道“谁互助拉犁，就贷给谁粮食吃。”五个互助组都采取了“兑地”的做活办法，组里不计工，犁了地就报告村公所领粮食。当时为了顾嘴，吃亏沾光都不说，这时有些不公平，群众都会原谅的说：“咱村穷，区里特别照顾咱村！”秋收后，村里买了七头牛，有些是长、短工队买的，有些是地主富农买的。县里开劳英大会时，小孙兴甲被选为全县的第一名劳动英雄，奖了一只头号大牛。
    到了冬天，全区闹起赎地及民主斗争，领导上仍确定小屯贯澈互助的方针。这时小屯每个农民脑子里都装着问题——“谁不参加互助，谁就是独立营”，及“咱村不叫斗争！”群众虽都感觉光开会实在麻烦，但不参加互助就成了“独立营”，谁也不能说啥。地主孙凤德看了别村斗争非常厉害，他想早晚脱不了挨斗，就“自动”拿出了十口袋粮食，交给了村公所，企图缓和群众斗争的要求。不两天，村上又传出了“谁互助谁能吃粮食”的论调。
    三十四年春，小屯建立起来了一个权力组织——互助社，下设五个互助大队，社里的组织委员是地主孙凤德，孙兴甲当了社长，孙贾彦为检查委员，都分头兼职大队长。这时牛力缺乏，人力互助的要求非常迫切，全村分为十七个互助组。有了互助社以后，小组长每天晚上向社里记帐去。劳动互助社成立后，孙兴甲曾领导的那伙到距小屯十多里的刘之固，开荒三天，自带吃食自带种籽，白果白种，直到现在，刘之固的人们还常说：“咱村没有小屯孙麻子，非饿死不可。”
    以后二区并入一区，县委干部都离了这个基点村，劳动社的会计陈善也被调到潘官砦教学去了，从此以后，群众都三三两两的细细讨论，有的就说：“咱他妈的白干活二年，也不能明白明白！”有的说：“长的工票赔一半卖给干部，人家还嫌不中呢！”陈之清见人就说：“咱欠一个工，社里一时不等，非要不行，咱长工，人家就不问了，我这一个一千元的工票，五百元卖给社，人家还不愿意要呢！”有的说：“这牛工给咱做一天活，咱两天也还不清人家。”有的说：“干部都不做活，他们的地也没荒！”在这种情况下，小屯的互助社即垮台了。
    小屯的互助社从成立到垮台，有二年多的历史，为什么突然垮台了呢？主要的原因是，当时群众在灾荒下，要求互助。领导上也注意了帮助小屯搞好互助。当时别村在斗争，小屯却闹生产，地主富农掌握了领导权，社长孙兴甲成了单纯的任务执行者，地主把牛工定的特别高，贫农普遍的反映：“人家有牛的户，欠人家的工，锄地时先将有牛户的地锄完，才能锄自己的！”贫农吃亏太大。一旦灾荒过去，贫农觉悟这样吃亏没头时，就不愿互助了，少数干部又从中取巧，闹不团结，分成了几派，正派的干部受嫉妒，少数强迫命令作风不正的干部，倒非常吃得开，如陈善言任会计，自己光管管财，组员就全部将他的地耕种了。
    今年领导上又从七月份下手整顿，经过了两个月整理，在群众的自愿结合下，又重新组织七个互助组，内包括三十八个整劳力和十五头牛，又开两个组磨粉，一个组轧花，经过几月的互助增产，现已多掘粪坑七十一个，全村积肥四三二车，草粪三三八车，原有一九头牛，现增至二一头，原有猪九口，现增至二三口，原有羊七，增够三十个，领导上正以过去垮台的原因，教育群众，互助组现正整理扩大中。
