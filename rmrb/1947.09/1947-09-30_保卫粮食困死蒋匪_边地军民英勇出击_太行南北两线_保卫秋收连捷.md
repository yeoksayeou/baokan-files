    [This newspaper's Taihang dispatch, 29th] The autumn harvest defense battle in the border areas on both the north and south sides of Taihang is being fiercely launched. On the southern front, Chiang's troops continue to be transferred south, and the remnants of the enemy besieged in "isolated islands" are gathering local bandits to plunder grain and conscript soldiers everywhere. The enemy in Anyang has planned to seize 500,000 catties of grain and conscript 15,000 people in the area. Since the 13th of this month, the enemy has concentrated its forces and begun to set out in multiple routes, extending to our border areas to establish temporary grain-grabbing strongholds. The struggle of the military and civilians in Anyang to protect grain has been widely launched (see page 2 of this newspaper on the 27th for details). The militia and local armed forces of Yexian (newly established county) east of Anyang took the initiative to strike against the Chiang bandits who were seizing grain. On the night of the 4th of this month, the county brigade, in coordination with the militia of the Third District and a part of the Zhangnan Brigade, fiercely attacked the enemy's rice and flour garrison, killing the deputy captain of the plainclothes team, Li Guobiao, and seven others, seizing ten long and short guns and more than 500 rounds of ammunition, and 480,000 yuan in bandit currency. The local masses engaged in the autumn harvest were greatly encouraged. The militia of the Third District, which supported the autumn harvest in the border areas, also publicized the news of the victory of the Southern Expeditionary Army everywhere, launching a political offensive in the forward areas. On the 2nd, the cadre team and the working team of the Second District of the county learned that more than 30 members of the "Returning Home Corps" were seizing grain in Lian Village, and immediately rushed to surround the enemy, intercepting all the seized grain and materials, killing and capturing nine enemies. Since the beginning of the month, the entire county has annihilated more than 50 Chiang bandits seizing grain in ten days. Two battalions of the 125th Brigade of the 47th Division of the Chiang bandits south of the Daokou-Qinghua Railway, together with parts of the pseudo-People's Self-Defense Forces of Xiuwu, Huojia, and Wuzhi, have been conducting "encirclement and suppression" in our Xiuwu, Huojia, and Wuzhi triangular area since the 29th of last month, attempting to destroy our regime in the area and drive out our local armed forces that have persisted in the area, attempting to seize grain and conscript soldiers on a large scale on both sides of the Daokou-Qinghua Railway. Thanks to the successive victories of our Chen-Xie army heading south, and the persistent internal decentralized operations of the local armed forces of Xiuwu, Huojia, and Wuzhi, we have completely crushed the enemy's "encirclement and suppression" attempt by the 9th of this month. After the victory against "encirclement and suppression" south of the Daokou-Qinghua Railway, the Chiang bandits trapped in the Xiuwu, Huojia, and Wuzhi area have become increasingly clear in their conspiracy to seize grain. Currently, the enemy in Xiuwu is constantly committing crimes north of the Daokou-Qinghua Railway, and attempting to occupy Wuliyuan (north of Xiuwu) as a grain-grabbing stronghold. Our grain-protecting armed forces active on both sides of Daokou-Qinghua are organizing a comprehensive counterattack, ambushing the Chiang bandits on that line. On the northern front, the entire 7th Brigade of the Chiang bandit 6th Division (formerly reorganized from the 3rd Army) stationed in Shimen has been seizing grain in the area north and east of Shimen since the 8th of this month, and has now transferred to the area southwest of Shimen, directly cooperating with Wei Yonghe's pseudo-bandits in Yuanshi to seize grain. At present, the party, government, army, and civilians in Yuanshi County, under the slogan of "seizing the autumn harvest to support the great counteroffensive," have begun a large-scale autumn harvest. On the 9th, the military and political organs of the county organized more than 50 villages of liberated peasants, each carrying sickles and carrying poles, led by village cadres, with militiamen and peasant association members as the backbone, and under the armed protection of the troops, adopted the method of seizing, harvesting, and cutting while fighting, and harvested more than 100 mu of autumn grain from the treacherous landlords who fled to Zhitun and Nanbailou in the suburbs of Yuanshi City, encouraging the liberated peasants on both sides to seize and divide the fields, and established secret guerrilla armed forces for the masses in the border areas. On the 12th of this month, the Yan bandit 49th Division stationed in the Yuci-Shouyang section of the Zhengtai Railway, combined with the 213th Regiment of the 71st Division and a part of the local special agent armed forces, invaded Shouyang City and Qinquan (west of Yangquan), and on the 14th, they fled back to the Qingping and Huangdan (both northwest of Shouyang) area in a panic. This probing offense by the enemy has completely exposed its conspiracy to seize grain in the western section of the Zhengtai Railway. Under the slogan of "strike first to gain the upper hand," the large-scale armed grain seizure in our Jinzhong area has also begun.
