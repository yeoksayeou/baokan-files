    The People's Local Corps and mass guerrilla forces in the Taihang area, after General Qin Jiwei's troops left Taihang and crossed the Yellow River to the south, have actively coordinated with the great counter-offensive, launching fierce attacks on the Chiang Kai-shek bandits entrenched around various points and lines in this area, both north and south.
    On the Yubei battlefield, when our army was heading south, the enemy quickly pieced together troops to be sent south as reinforcements, desperate to save themselves. Our Taihang local corps and guerrilla forces, active on both sides of the Pinghan and Daoqing lines in northern Henan, launched attacks on the Chiang Kai-shek bandits everywhere. On the 6th of this month, a unit of more than 1,000 men from the 38th Division of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits stationed in Jiaozuo launched an attack on Baishan, Shangtun, and other places northwest of Jiaozuo. We intercepted them at Shangtun Village, wiping out 45 enemies in one fell swoop. On the 8th, more than 1,000 enemies from Jiaozuo attacked the Dajiazuo area again. A part of our main force wiped out more than 170 enemies at Guitun. We captured 5 machine guns and more than 30 rifles and horse rifles. On both sides of Pinghan, the mass armed forces combined with land distribution to wage an increasingly vigorous guerrilla war. After the masses in Yexian (newly established county east of Anyang) proposed "persist in place, armed land distribution," they immediately advanced into the enemy's rear and launched guerrilla warfare. Since the Liu-Deng army went south, the army and people of the county have fought valiantly behind enemy lines for more than 40 days, eliminating more than 1,300 Chiang Kai-shek bandits and despots. Relying on Huixian, the guerrilla armed forces that advanced into the enemy's rear in Xinxiang have opened up a vast base area behind enemy lines, stretching east to Jixian, Weihe River, west to Huoxian, and south to the Daoqing line, with more than 120 villages and more than 100,000 farmers. The people's guerrilla armed forces frequently appear openly in the Huanggang area, eight miles from the suburbs of Xinxiang.
    On the northern front, local corps and guerrilla groups also launched active offensives to provide strong support for the southward counter-offensive army. On the 26th of last month, our local guerrilla corps launched an offensive against the periphery of Shijiazhuang, and captured Nantongye, a satellite stronghold 30 miles from Shijiazhuang. On the 11th of this month, Wei Ni Yonghe's troops stationed in Yuanshi City attempted to build blockhouses in Chichi Village north of the city to expand their territory. They were annihilated by a part of our local main corps, with more than 30 enemies wiped out and 2 machine guns and more than 30 rifles captured. At present, the struggle in this area is still deadlocked in Yuanshi, an isolated city, and the Dachehang area on the periphery of Shijiazhuang.
    In the Pingchuan area of Yuci, Taigu, and Qixian in Jinzhong, various mass guerrilla armed forces, including militia and work teams, often use sniper fire combined with landmine warfare to direct the enemy into minefields with sniper fire. The militia in the Fourth District of Taigu eliminated more than 40 enemies in two instances. The annihilation of more than 400 Yan-puppet soldiers of the Ninth Column between Taigu City and Yangyi on the 27th of last month was a particularly brilliant battle example. At present, the increasingly tense and acute autumn harvest defense war of the mass guerrilla warfare has been launched in various places.

    太行南北各线人民地方武装
    配合大反攻猛击蒋匪
    【本报太行十七日电】秦基伟将军所部离太行南渡黄河后，太行区人民地方兵团及群众游击武装，为积极配合大反攻，南北各线均予困守本区周围各点线之蒋匪以猛烈打击。
    在豫北战场上，当我军南下前后，即迅速拚凑部队南调救死。活跃在豫北平汉、道清两侧之我太行地方兵团及游击武装，则到处对蒋匪展开打击。本月六日，驻焦作蒋匪三十八师一部千余人，向焦作西北之柏山、上屯等地进犯，我于上屯村截击，一举歼敌四十五名。八日，焦作敌千余人，又犯大贾作一带，我主力一部于贵屯歼敌百七十余名，我缴获机枪五挺，步马枪三十余支。平汉两侧，群众武装结合分田的游击战争益形蓬勃开展。邺县（安阳东新设县）群众提出“就地坚持，武装分田”后，随即挺进敌后，展开游击战。自刘邓大军南下后，该县军民敌后奋战四十余天，已消灭蒋匪奸霸一千三百余。以辉县为依托，挺进新乡敌后之游击武装，已开辟了东起汲县、卫河、西抵获取、南迄道清线的广大敌后根据地，拥有百廿余村庄，十余万农民，人民游击武装经常公开出没于新乡城郊八里之黄岗一带。
    北线方面：各地方兵团及游击集团，亦展开主动出击，给南下反攻大军以有力配合。上月二十六日，我地方游击兵团向石门外围发动攻势，当将距石门三十里之卫星据点南铜冶攻克。本月十一日，驻元氏城之魏逆永和部，妄图到城北之池村修碉堡，扩张地盘，当遭我地方主力兵团一部歼灭三十余名，缴获机枪二挺，步枪三十余支。目前该地区之斗争，仍胶着在元氏孤城及石门外围大车行一带。
    晋中榆（次）太（谷）祁（县）平川地带之民兵、武工队各种群众游击武装，冷枪结合地雷战，经常以冷枪指挥敌人陷入雷阵，太谷四区民兵两次即歼敌四十余。上月二十七日在太谷城至阳邑之间，歼灭阎伪九纵队四百余人，尤为光辉战例。目前各地群众游击战争更加紧张尖锐的秋收保卫战，已在各地展开。
