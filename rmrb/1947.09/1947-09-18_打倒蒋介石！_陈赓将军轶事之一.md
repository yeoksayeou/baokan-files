　　"Down with Chiang Kai-shek!"
	One of General Chen Geng's Anecdotes
	Ge Ma Ji
	General Chen Geng once saved Chiang Kai-shek's life during Chen Jiongming's rebellion. This is probably known to everyone. However, a few years later, Comrade Chen Geng was wounded in the anti-encirclement war. While staying in Shanghai to do underground work, he was arrested by Chiang Kai-shek, who put him in prison.

	Comrade Chen Geng knew that this "Chairman Chiang" would definitely use the excuse of "repaying kindness" to lure him into surrendering. That kind of "repayment," which would require him to betray the people, was more terrible than killing him. So, as soon as he entered the prison, he asked for a pen, ink, and some paper. After the paper and pen were brought, he filled every piece of paper with: "Down with Chiang Kai-shek!" The jailer was so frightened when he saw it that his eyes changed. He took the paper away, but then Chen Geng wrote all over the walls:
	"Down with Chiang Kai-shek!"
	"Down with Chiang Kai-shek!"

	Chiang Kai-shek found it difficult to speak, so he tried to corrupt his spirit by sending a beautiful woman into his cell every day. But this still couldn't soften General Chen's strong and unyielding spirit.

	Chiang Kai-shek became impatient and switched to a tougher approach. One day, he ordered his men to drag Comrade Chen Geng out, pointed a gun at his temple, and said, "Surrender or not!"... "One, two, three,"...

	"No!" General Chen replied decisively.

	Chiang Kai-shek was still not willing to admit defeat. He pushed Comrade Chen Geng alone into a room. That room was filled with pistols, daggers, poison..., and they said to General Chen, "Either surrender or commit suicide!" But General Chen laughed and said, "Ha! You're wrong. A Communist Party member will never surrender, but will never commit suicide easily either."

	Finally, Chiang Kai-shek personally took the stage and wanted to talk face-to-face, bringing Comrade Chen Geng to his office and waiting for him to come out and talk. Comrade Chen Geng lay on the sofa, and as he heard Chiang's footsteps approaching, he picked up a newspaper to cover his face, reading and cursing loudly at the same time.

	"Chiang Kai-shek, you son of a bitch, your actions are completely those of a traitor!"

	Chiang Kai-shek walked in, pretended not to hear, sat down, and recited his standard Chiang platitudes. Then he took out a surrender statement and asked Comrade Chen Geng to sign it. But General Chen grabbed it and tore it to pieces. Chiang's furious eyes were about to explode when, fortunately, Qian Dajun walked in, and the matter was diverted again. Not long after, Comrade Chen Geng received secret instructions and help from the Party and finally escaped from Chiang's clutches.

	More than ten years later, General Chen Geng has already led a mighty People's Liberation Army across the Yellow River. Chiang Kai-shek is bound to fall before the People's Liberation Army.

　　“打倒蒋介石！”
    陈赓将军轶事之一
    戈马记
    陈赓将军，曾在陈炯明叛变之役，救了蒋介石一命，这恐怕世人都知道的事情了。但在不几年后，陈赓同志因反围剿战争时负伤，留居上海作地下工作时，被蒋介石逮捕了，蒋介石却把他下了监狱。
    陈赓同志知道这位“蒋委员长”一定要借口“报恩”来诱他投降，而那种“报恩”，要他叛变人民，是比杀戮还可怕的。所以一进监狱，他就要求给他拿一枝笔墨和几张纸来。纸笔拿来以后，他在每张纸上都写满了：“打倒蒋介石”。狱卒一看吓得变了眼，把纸拿走了，他又把满墙都写的是：
    “打倒蒋介石，”
    “打倒蒋介石。”
    蒋介石不好开口了，就想腐蚀他的精神，每天送一个漂亮女人进牢里来，可是这依旧软化不了陈将军的坚强不屈精神。
    蒋介石急了，就换了一套硬的办法。一天，他命人把陈赓同志拖出去，用手枪指着太阳穴说：“投降不投降！”……“一、二、三，”……
    “不，”陈将军斩钉截铁的答复了他。
    蒋介石还不服输。又把陈赓同志一个人推进一间屋子里去。那屋里摆得有手枪、短刀、毒药………，他们对陈将军说：“或者投降，或者自杀！”可是陈赓将军笑了，他说：“嘿！你们想错了，一个共产党员是决不会投降的，可是也决不会轻易自杀”。
    最后，蒋介石就亲自出马，要当面谈话，把陈赓同志带到他的办公室里，等着他出来谈话。陈赓同志躺在沙发上，他听着蒋的脚步声，快走近了，就拿起一张报挡着脸，一边读着，一边破口大骂。
    “蒋介石，狗日的，所作所为，完全是个卖国贼！”
    蒋介石走进门来，装作没有听见，坐下来，谈了一遍蒋八股，然后掏出一张自首书来，要陈赓同志签字。但陈赓将军抓过来一把就撕碎了，蒋的牛屎火眼看正要发作，恰巧钱大钧走了进来，才算又岔开了。不久以后，陈赓同志得到党的秘密指示和帮助，终于越狱逃出了蒋的魔手。
    十多年后的今天，陈赓将军已经率领一支雄壮的人民解放军跨过黄河，蒋介石在人民解放军面前，是非倒不可了。
