　　"Old fellow! Old fellow..."
　　We shouted at the door for a long time, but no one answered. We arrived at night, and seeing the desolate state of the village, we knew that the "disaster troops" had just left. The comrades had been waiting impatiently for a long time.
　　The door was made of five or six small boards put together. After shouting for another ten minutes or so, an old woman in her thirties or forties came out.
　　"What are you doing?"
　　"Old lady, don't be afraid, we are the Eighth Route Army, we want to stay in your house," Squad Leader Cao said to her gently:
　　"The 'disaster troops' never stayed in my broken house when they were in our village. You don't mind it being so bad, do you?" She pointed to the broken house on the west side with a dissatisfied look. We went inside and settled down. She busied herself in the yard, moving the iron washbasin and broken broom to her own house (the east room), and she blocked the door from the inside with a dustpan and sieve.
　　The next day, the comrades of the Sixth Squad got up early to sweep the yard. Old Cao went to the door of the landlord's house:
　　"Old fellow! Old..." Before he could finish speaking, the old lady quickly came out to stop him, afraid that Old Cao would enter her room.
　　"What are you doing?" she replied hastily:
　　"Lend me your bucket to use."
　　"I don't have one, I have to borrow water from outside."
　　"Lend me your broom so we can sweep the yard!"
　　"I don't have one, you can find one in the yard!" she replied, showing that she didn't want to be bothered.
　　"Didn't you take it back to this room last night?" Old Cao's words left her speechless, so he took the opportunity to explain to her. He also said: "Seeing that the yard is so dirty, bring the broom and let's sweep it quickly!" Only then did the old lady slowly go into the room and bring out the broom.
　　"Don't break it, I only have this one old thing."
　　"Don't worry! Don't worry! We'll pay you for a new one if it breaks."
　　The other comrades were watering the yard and tidying up the interior. Everyone worked together and soon filled the landlord's water tank, and carried several loads of dirt, rubble, and tiles out of the yard. After we finished cleaning, we returned the things to the neighbors and the landlord. The old lady was too embarrassed to take the broken broom back into the house, and pointed to the base of the west wall, saying:
　　"Just put it there!"
　　This landlord had two grown children, the older one was only nineteen years old, who went outside to chop firewood all day, and a young daughter-in-law who was probably only seventeen years old, who rarely came out of the yard. These days, the old lady had to bring her food to the room. During the day, the old lady often sat at the door, which was blocked by a winnow, afraid that someone would enter her room.
　　One evening, Old Cao ran back from the company headquarters, jumping and shouting, and said to everyone:
　　"The higher-ups have assigned a three-day mass work plan to..." Old Cao explained the mass work plan to everyone in great detail, and everyone was confident in being a model of mass work, starting with getting through to the landlord's thinking. The next day, before dawn, everyone started to carry out the plan. In the evening, everyone came back from helping the masses with their work. The old lady asked her eldest son, Song Panniu, to serve Old Cao rice. Her face was full of smiles as she said:
　　"You are really good! Since you came five or six days ago, everything has been clean, and you carry water and water the garden for us, and you speak so nicely. Why did such good people become soldiers?"
　　"The Eighth Route Army is all so good, the Eighth Route Army is working for the people. If you don't believe it, go and see the west; the poor people in the base areas have all turned over, received land, and been allocated houses, and are no longer subject to the exploitation and oppression of the landlords..." Before Comrade Gao Cunzhu could finish speaking to her, the old lady interrupted and asked:
　　"I heard that there is a Women's Rescue Association in the base area, what does it do?"
　　Old Cao was always good at talking. When he heard the old lady asking Cunzhu, he hurriedly interjected:
　　"The Women's Rescue Association stands up for women, so they are not oppressed by their mothers-in-law. Men and women talk about equality, and organize women to help each other in production..." The sixteen or seventeen-year-old daughter-in-law, who had been cooped up at home for many days and couldn't stand it any longer, heard her mother and Old Cao talking about women's affairs, and secretly walked out of the yard, sitting behind her mother's butt. From then on, she dared to say half a sentence to the comrades, and in this hot weather, she no longer wanted to be stifled in the narrow thatched hut.
　　One day, after morning exercises, everyone sang songs and came back. They were washing their faces in the yard when the landlord's daughter-in-law came out of the east room wearing clean coarse cloth floral clothes and with a big braid, her face full of smiles. Everyone was a little surprised, and secretly praised her in their hearts:
　　"What a talent! Why did she have a dirty face a few days ago?"
　　Today, she has braided her hair. The comrades still couldn't figure out the reason. Old Cao was a good talker, and he couldn't hold back the words in his stomach, so he asked gently:
　　"Sister-in-law, why didn't you comb your hair today?"
　　The girl glanced at him, smiled shyly, and answered naively:
　　"I am just a daughter, now I am not afraid of you anymore!"

　　媳妇变成了闺女
    赵佩珩
    “老乡！老乡……”
    我们喊了半天门，就是不见吭声，我们是晚上赶到的，看村里那股荒凉劲，就知道是“遭殃军”刚走，同志们可早等的不耐烦了。
    这门子是五六块小板合起来的，好容易又喊了十几分钟的样子，才走出来了一位三四十岁的老大娘，
    “做甚哩？”
    “老大娘不要害怕，我们是八路军，要到你这里住住房，”曹班长温和的对她说：
    “遭殃军在俺村的时候，永没有住过俺这破房子，你们不嫌赖了住哇！”她含着不满意的样子用手指给西边的破房子说。我们便进去了，我们住下来，她便在院中东一头西一头地忙着，将铁洗脸盆、破扫帚、一趟一趟都搬到自己的房子里（东屋），她并且在里面用簸子、簸箕、将屋门挡住。
    次日六班同志们早早起来打扫院子，老曹走到房东的门口：
    “老乡！老……”不等他把话说完，老大娘很快的出来拦着了，恐怕老曹进了她的屋，
    “做甚哩？”她慌忙的答道：
    “借你水桶使使。”
    “俺没有，俺吃水还得去外边借哩。”
    “拿你的扫帚咱把院子扫扫吧！”
    “俺没有，你从院里找吧！”她表现出嫌麻烦的样子回答着。
    “昨天晚上你不是拿回这个屋子了吗？”老曹这一句话说的她无话可答，便乘势给她解释了一番。又说：看这个院子这样脏，拿扫帚来咱赶快扫扫吧！这老大娘才慢慢地走进屋内将扫帚拿了出来；
    “你们可不要给咱坏了，咱就这一个破格茬。”
    “不怕！不怕！坏了赔你个新的。”
    其他同志都在用水泼院子，整理内务，大家一齐动手，一会儿将房东的缸担满了，院子里的灰土、瓦砾、往外边挑了好几担，我们打扫完了将东西送还了邻居和房东，老大娘再不好意思将破扫帚拿到屋内，指着西墙根说道：
    “就放在那里哇！”
    这房东有两个大孩子，大的才十九岁，整天到外边砍柴火，一个小媳妇大约不过十七岁的样子，很少走出院子来，这几天还得老大娘给她往屋里端饭，白天这老大娘经常坐在箕箩挡好了的门口只怕有人进了她屋里。
    一天晚上老曹又蹦又跳的由连部跑回来向大家说道：
    “上级布置了三天群众工作计划要……”老曹给大家把群众工作的计划谈的非常详细，大家都有信心当群众工作的模范，首先从打通房东思想作起。第二天天不亮，大家都按照计划进行起来。晚上，大家由外边帮助群众做活回来，老大娘让她的大孩子宋盘牛给老曹盛饭，她的脸上堆满了笑容说：
    “你们实在好呀！自你们来了五六天啦，那里都是干干净净的，又给担水，又给浇园，说话又好，你们这样好的老百姓怎样当了兵来？”
    “八路军都是这样好，八路军是给老百姓办事哩，你不信去西边看看；根据地里的穷苦老百姓都翻了身，得到土地，分到了房子，再不受地主的剥削和压迫了。……”高存珠同志还未给她说完，老大娘又插嘴问道：
    “听说根据地有妇救会哩，那是干甚哩呀？”
    老曹从来就好说话，听见老大娘又问存珠哩，便急忙插嘴道：
    “妇救会是给妇女作主，不受婆婆压迫，男女讲平等，组织妇女互助搞生产；……”十六七岁的小媳妇，在家里闷了好多天实在待不住了，听见她娘和老曹谈妇女的事情，便偷偷地走出院中，坐在她娘的屁股后边，从此以后她才敢和同志们说一半句话，这样热的天气她再也不肯闷热在窄小的茅屋里了。
    一天出罢早操，大家唱着歌回来，正在院中洗脸，房东的小媳妇穿了干净的粗布花衣裳，梳了个大辫子由东屋内走出来，脸上堆满了的笑容，大家都有些惊奇，心里都暗暗的称赞她：
    “好人才呀！为什么前几天弄了一脸肮脏呢？”
    今天，她梳成了大辫子了，同志们始终摸不透原因何在，老曹是好说话的人，话在肚里便蹩不住，他轻轻的问道：
    “大嫂你今天怎么没有梳起头来？”
    这个姑娘瞅了他一眼，笑了一笑羞得红了脸，天真的答道：
    “俺就是闺女，如今俺不怕你们啦！”
