　　Taihang Fifth Prefectural Committee
  　Instructions to Defend the Autumn Harvest
    [Our newspaper Taihang, 1st dispatch] On the 25th of last month, the Taihang Fifth Prefectural Committee issued instructions to the counties bordering northern Henan to defend the autumn harvest. It stated firstly: The autumn harvest is approaching, and the stubborn puppet troops and "homecoming corps" are trapped in strongholds, facing supply difficulties. They will inevitably plunder grain on a large scale, and the grain struggle will once again become a major link in the struggle between the enemy and us. If the grain is not properly defended, it will increase our difficulties in production and weathering the famine. This year's autumn harvest struggle will be more intense, acute, and prolonged than any previous year, and its significance is even greater. We must deeply understand this and take vigorous action, waging fierce guerrilla warfare to defend the autumn harvest. Secondly, the county committees should divide the work between the front and rear, organize strong front-line headquarters and guerrilla corps, strive for the initiative, and launch a comprehensive offensive against the enemy, reaching the enemy's flanks and rear, destroying puppet township and bao offices, attacking small enemy armed forces, capturing scattered grain-grabbing personnel, disrupting enemy order, and thwarting enemy grain-grabbing plans. Thirdly, local armed forces should combine with the militia to cover the masses in reaping, threshing, drying, and storing grain as they go, resolutely suppressing grain-grabbing traitors and bullies. Fourthly, during the defense of the autumn harvest, launch a merit-based competition, regularly summarize achievements, and promptly commend and model exemplary individuals.

　　太行五地委
  　指示保卫秋收
    【本报太行一日电】上月二十五日太行五地委及早向豫北边沿各县发出保卫秋收指示。首称：秋收将到，顽伪及“还乡团”困守据点，供应困难，必然要大肆抢粮，粮食斗争又成为敌我斗争主要一环，粮食保卫不好，就会增加我们生产渡荒的困难，今年秋收斗争，将会比任何一年都要紧张、尖锐、长期，意义更为重大，我们必须深刻认识，紧张的行动起来，为保卫秋收进行猛烈的游击战争。其次，县委应前后方分工，组织强有力的前方指挥部及游击兵团，争取主动，对敌开展全面攻势，到敌人侧翼后方，摧毁伪乡、保公所，打击敌人小股武装，捕捉零星抢粮人员，打乱敌人秩序，粉碎敌抢粮计划。第三、地方武装应结合民兵，掩护群众随收、随打、随晒、随藏，坚决镇压抢粮奸霸。第四、在保卫秋收中，开展立功竞赛运动，定期总结，及时表功表模。
