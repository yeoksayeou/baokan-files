    Jia Juyou Comprehensively Organizes Labor
    Men, Women, Old and Young All Work Together to Complete Sowing Early
    [Report from Changzhi by this newspaper] The Guxian Village in the Second District held a mass meeting of the entire village on September 18th to commend the Jia Juyou group for comprehensively organizing labor, seizing the time and completing the replanting of wheat two days early, promoting the village's harvesting and planting work. At the meeting, Jia Juyou, a model mutual aid group member, spoke about his experience: "After the higher authorities proposed a rush to sow, our group discussed it, and the emancipated activists eagerly put forward slogans. Jing Baosheng said: 'Everyone should be careful to guard against continuous cloudy days.' Fan Laibao said: 'There is a lot of rain in autumn, so let's hurry up and plant wheat,' which promoted the comprehensive organization of our group. The whole group has thirty female full laborers, eighteen male full laborers, two old men, and three children. After everyone's research and scientific division of labor, four men are in charge of driving eight animals to plow the land, calculating five points of work per mu; three men and three children are in charge of driving three animals to sow wheat, calculating two points of work per mu; five men are in charge of carrying manure, carrying nine loads of nine catties of rice per day in far away fields, and near fields are converted according to the distance of the distant fields; two old men and four women are in charge of cutting grass to feed two animals, carrying three catties of rice per day. Five men and five women are in charge of breaking up clods and clearing field edges and corners, calculating six points of work per two mu; twenty-one women are in charge of cutting 32 mu of millet in three days, thirteen points per mu for sparse millet, fifteen points for dense millet, and eighteen points for carrying, and the distribution with the family is 20% and 80%. Originally, we planned to complete 118 mu of wheat in ten days, but after comprehensive organization, we completed it in seven days. Those who cut millet also participated in changing the wheat, striving to finish sowing two days early." After the speech, everyone applauded enthusiastically to commend them. Each group is learning from the Jia Juyou group and comprehensively organizing labor to rush to plant wheat and harvest autumn crops. (Zhenhua, Guxian Correspondent Group)
