　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 6th. A comprehensive report:

　　Bevin delivered a speech at the 76th annual meeting of the British Trades Union Congress in Southport on the 3rd, demanding that the United States redistribute its gold holdings. This speech has aroused "stirred" reactions from all sectors of the United States (Reuters, 4th). Bevin stated: The current situation in Britain is that "for the first time in four hundred years, Britain has no way to deal with goods, money, and coal production." However, the gold stored in the Federal Reserve Bank's vault at Fort Knox in Kentucky, USA, is worth 21.765 billion US dollars, accounting for more than 90% of the world's existing official reserves. Bevin stated: This is the real reason for the current financial difficulties of countries ravaged by war. He also stated: "Gold should be redistributed to these countries to increase their consumption power, instead of being stored in a useless place." British officials reported on the 4th: Before making the above speech, Bevin had an informal conversation with the US Ambassador to Britain, Douglas, regarding this proposal. On the 4th, in a 70-minute meeting with US congressmen who are currently investigating the economic situation in Britain and Western Europe, Bevin also elaborated on his plan. Because, in Britain's view, the redistribution of American gold is a component of the Marshall Plan for aid to Europe. However, Bevin's speech aroused excitement in the United States. Spokespersons from the US Congress stated on the 4th that they "absolutely do not express any opinion" on Bevin's request. Financial figures in Fort Knox stated that they did not know what value this proposal had. On the 4th, Washington D.C. newspapers and the Wall Street Journal unanimously ridiculed Bevin's proposal as a "prank," believing that it could not solve the economic crisis in Western Europe. US Treasury Secretary Snyder suddenly stated: "America's gold is America's business." A spokesperson for the US Finance Committee even declared: "If Britain wants gold, it can come to the United States to buy it at $35 an ounce."

　　贝文想要美国黄金美资本家反唇相讥
    【新华社陕北六日电】综合报导：贝文三日在南港英国职工会七十六届年会上发表演说，要求美国重新分配其所据有的黄金。此项演说已引起美国各方面“骚动”的反应（路透社四日电）。贝文称：目前英国的形势是：“四百年来第一次英国在货物、金钱与煤产上没有办法。”但是在美国肯塔基州陆军要塞诺克斯堡联邦准备银行金库中所存有的黄金，价值则达二百十七亿六十五百余万美元，约占世界现有正式准备金百分之九十强。贝文称：这是受战争蹂躏各国目前财政困难的真正原因。并称：“黄金应重新分配于这些国家，以增加他们的消费力，而不应保存于无用之地”。英官方人士四日讯：贝文作上述演说前，曾将此项建议与美驻英大使道格拉斯作非正式的交谈，而四日在与刻正调查英国与西欧经济情况的美议员七十分钟会议中，贝文亦曾详述其计划。因为在英国看来重新分配美国的黄金，是马歇尔援欧计划组成部分。但贝文的演说引起了美国的激动，美国各院发言人四日称：他们对贝文的要求“绝对不表示任何意见。”诺克斯堡财政界人士则表示不知此建议倒底有什么价值。华府四日各报及华尔街日报则对贝文建议一致讥之为“恶作剧”，认为它并不能解救西欧的经济危机。而美财长斯奈德则忽然称：“美国的黄金是美国的事情。”美财委一发言人甚至声明：“英国如要黄金，可以到美国来买，一盎司三十五美元。”
