    Double Hero Liang Madou Becomes a Correspondent for This Newspaper
    To the Comrades of the Correspondence Section of the People's Daily:

    I received the letter you sent me, and I am very happy. In the old society, I didn’t dare to speak my mind in front of others; no one treated me like a human being. I lived under people's feet for more than thirty years. The Communist Party saved me and made me a human being. You wrote to me asking me to be a correspondent for the Party newspaper, and I have long been willing, but because I don't recognize many characters and I don't have enough material, I am very ashamed. In the future, I will definitely write down everything the masses in my village do in the production movement, writing down everything I see, "writing how things are done," and honestly writing to the Party newspaper about the creations of the masses. I think "as long as you do it, you can do it well, and if you do it well, you will gain experience." Because I am an old rough farmer, I hope you will often write to help me progress.
    With
          Respectful Greetings,
          Liang Madou, on the night of September 15th, in Licun Gou
    (I can't write, this is what I said and asked someone else to write for me.)

    双英雄梁马斗当本报通讯员
    人民日报通讯科各同志：
    你们给我捎的信收到了，我很高兴，旧社会我话说不在人前头，没人把我当人看待，在人家脚底下活了三十多年，共产党把我救活成了人。你们来信，叫我当党报的通讯员，我早就愿意，不过因为我一来不识几个字，二来材料也不够，这是很惭愧的，以后我一定要把我村群众在生产运动中的一切活动，有一点写一点，“怎样做怎样写”，老老实实把群众的创造给党报写去，我以为“只要干就能干好，干好就有经验”。因为我是个农民老粗，希望你们常来信帮助我向前进步。  致以
          敬礼
          梁马斗  九月十五夜于李村沟
    （我不会写，这是我说求别人给我写的。）
