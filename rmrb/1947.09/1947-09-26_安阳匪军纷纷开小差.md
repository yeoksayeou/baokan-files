    An Yang News: Chiang's puppet troops inside the city are deserting extensively because they feel the general trend is against them. From August 1st to the 17th alone, the Taihang Fifth Military Subdistrict's reception center alone received 25 deserters from the 40th Division (remnants). The number of those who were not received or did not pass through this place far exceeds this number. The reasons for their desertion are nothing more than: First, they cannot get enough to eat. According to regulations, each person is supposed to receive 25 liang of rice (or flour) daily by the new scale. After deducting for weight loss and embezzlement, each person can only eat two small bowls of rice per meal; eating flour means only two bowls of thin porridge. If soldiers run away from the company, the superiors will also deduct provisions as punishment, for example, if ten soldiers run away, they will deduct the provisions for twenty or thirty soldiers, so that everyone cannot get enough to eat. For example, the special service team of the 39th Brigade of the division only averaged 13 liang of rice per person per day because too many soldiers had run away. As for the vegetable allowance, according to regulations, it is 400 yuan of Nationalist currency per person per day. A catty of pumpkin costs 2,000 yuan, so there is no question of eating vegetables, oil, or salt. Even though they are not full, they still have to perform duties, drill, and renovate fortifications as usual. Second, they cannot stand the oppression of the bandit officers: the beating and scolding system is very severe. For example, Liang Jincai, a deserter from the special service company of the 39th Brigade of the division, said: "I am a new recruit in the squad, and all the work of fetching water and sweeping the floor in the squad is my responsibility. In the morning, I have to fold the squad leader's quilt and fetch water for washing his face. At night, I have to make the bed for the squad leader. When eating, the thick porridge is always for the squad leader and the veteran soldiers. If the squad leader and veteran soldiers do not take a second bowl, the new recruits dare not take a second bowl. A little carelessness will result in beatings and scolding. I am illiterate. Every time the squad leader hit me, I would draw a line on the wall. After a month, there were seventeen lines on the wall. The company and platoon commanders also beat me a lot. Later, I really couldn't stand it anymore. One night, the squad leader came back from visiting a prostitute while I was on guard. I made up my mind that I would rather stab one person to death and run away than die in vain. So, when he opened the door, I stabbed the squad leader to death with a bayonet. Then I jumped over the three-zhang-high city wall and ran away." Third, they are all poor peasants and small vendors who were conscripted. Their families depend on them for a living. They have never fought in a war. Especially after our army's siege of Anyang, they felt the intensity of our army's artillery fire. Therefore, they felt that if they did not run away to save their lives early, they would die sooner or later, so they might as well run away early. (Ze Bo)

    安阳匪军纷纷开小差
    【本报安阳讯】城内蒋伪因感大势已去，逃亡现象甚盛就自八月一日至十七日十七大中，仅太行五分区一个收容所即收容四十师（残部）逃兵廿五名，其他未被收容或未经此地者，远超此数。他们逃亡的原因不外乎：第一、吃不饱。照规定每人每日大米（或面）新秤廿五两，脱秤，克扣后，每人一顿只能吃两小碗饭；吃面只能喝两碗稀糊糊。如果连里跑了兵，上面还扣给养，比如跑十个兵，就许扣廿个三十个兵的给养，叫每个人都吃不饱，以示惩罚。如该师三十九旅特务队，就因为跑的兵太多，每人每天只平均吃到十三两米。至于菜金，照规定每人每日蒋币四百元，南瓜就两千元一斤，所以就谈不到吃菜吃油盐更不用提了。吃不饱，仍要照常摊勤务、出操装修工事。第二、受不了匪官压迫：打骂制度非常厉害，如该师三十九旅特务连逃兵梁进才谈称：“咱在班里是个新兵，所有班里打水、扫地，都是咱的事，早起要给班长摺被子，打洗脸水，晚上要给班长铺床，吃饭时，稠的尽着班长和老兵吃，班长老兵不盛第二碗，新兵不敢盛第二碗。稍一不慎就打骂交加。咱不识字，班长打我一次，我在墙上画一道，一月下来，墙上整整画了十七道；连排长也不少打我。后来实在受不下去了，夜里班长嫖窑子回来，正当我的岗，我下了决心，宁可刺死一个跑了，也不零受死，就趁着开门的时候，一刺刀把班长刺死了。就此跳出三丈高的城墙跑了。第三、他们都是被抓来的贫苦农民和小贩，家里指望他们过活，没打过仗，特别经过此次我军围困安阳，感到我军炮火的猛烈，因之觉得不早逃活命，迟早是一个死，不如早跑。（泽博）
