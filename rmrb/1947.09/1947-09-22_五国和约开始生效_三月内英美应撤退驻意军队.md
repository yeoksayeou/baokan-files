    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 19th. Reports from all sides: The Allied treaties with Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland were officially announced to take effect from the 15th. The state of war in law with the five former Axis satellite countries has thus officially ended. The ceremony for depositing the instruments of ratification of the treaties was held separately in Moscow and Paris on the 15th. The treaty with Italy is deposited in France, while the treaties with Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, and Finland are deposited in the Soviet Union. According to the treaty, within ninety days of the treaty's entry into force, Britain and the United States must withdraw their troops stationed in Italy, and the Soviet Union must also withdraw its troops stationed in Bulgaria. However, in order to maintain traffic in the Soviet-occupied zone of Austria, the Soviet Union still has the right to station troops in Hungary and Romania.

    三月内英美应撤退驻意军队
    【新华社陕北十九日电】各方讯：盟国对意、罗、保、匈、芬五国和约，正式宣布自十五日起生效，对五个前轴心卫星国法律上之战争状态，从此正式告终。和约批准书交存仪式于十五日在莫斯科巴黎两地分别举行，对意和约存于法国，对匈、罗、保、芬四国和约则存于苏联。按和约规定，在和约生效九十天内，英美两国必须撤退其驻意军队，苏联亦撤退其驻保军队。但为维持奥境苏占区交通，苏联仍有权驻军于匈、罗两国。
