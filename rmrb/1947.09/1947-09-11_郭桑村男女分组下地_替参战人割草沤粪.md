　　【Jilu Yu Daily News, 9th】 Xinggu and Guo Sang villages in the third district of Gaoling have achieved remarkable results in combining production with war support. After Guo Sang Village provided stretchers, the masses, in order to solve the difficulties of the families of those fighting at the front and the stretcher bearers, decided that all men and women militia members in the village would be divided into groups led by cadres to launch a two-day surprise attack to cut thatch, solving the difficulties of fertilizer accumulation for the families of soldiers and stretcher bearers. As a result, each group set a competition plan to strive to be a model. The women's group led by Guo Renni's wife cut enough thatch for two large carts in one morning. Li Xinming's squad of fifteen people cut 16,000 catties in two days, enough to accumulate 450 carts of manure, which solved the wheat planting problem for the families of soldiers and stretcher bearers, and the entire village was in high spirits. Xinggu Village Primary School, under the principle of "integrating theory with practice, serving the masses," participated in production labor. All 106 students in the school freely formed into groups of three to five people to weed the fields for the farmers participating in frontline war support work. Everyone had four or five blisters on their hands but still did not rest. In ten days, they hoed a total of 140 mu of autumn seedlings and also helped the families of soldiers, workers, and martyrs hoe 93 mu of land. During breaks, they discussed and studied issues, such as the attitude they should have towards tilling land on behalf of others, combining study with production, and agricultural knowledge. They worked in the morning and afternoon every day, and in the morning they conducted production reviews, commending the good and criticizing the bad. At the seven-day summary, Wang Dingfeng, Wang Lanru, and other groups were selected as model groups because they hoed the land well and quickly and discussed the issues thoroughly. Female students Wen Xiumin and Liu Ruiying were selected as labor models.
