Taiyue, September 11th (Our Newspaper) - Zhang Wenhong, a resident of Songyu Village, Qinshui County, and his two brothers, who had been living separately for ten years, have now re-established cohabitation in order to realize their plan for economical production. The three brothers separated as early as 1937 and have been living apart for a full ten years. Recently, because Zhang Wendou was working in the district and Zhang Wenhong was working in the coal mine cooperative, they were unable to take good care of their families. On the 24th of last month, Zhang Wendou returned from the district and convened a family meeting, inviting all the village cadres to participate. The three families made profound reviews of their past shortcomings. Then, Zhang Wendou's wife, Wei Aiqing, proposed: "We must live together to prosper!" Zhang Wenlie's wife, Yi Zhonglian, immediately interjected with a smile: "I have long wanted to live together. The government is calling for thrift this year. Our family doesn't save much by living apart. As the saying goes, 'One pot wastes water, two pots waste rice,' and 'When three people are of one mind, yellow earth can turn into gold.' Cohabitation means more people and more strength, and there are ways to prosper." Under these circumstances, all nine members of the family said, "This is a good idea." So, they officially implemented cohabitation and made a precise plan for thrift and prosperity:

The whole family cultivates a total of 26 mu of land. Zhang Wenlie participates in the war a lot and is responsible for 15 mu. Zhang Wenhong is responsible for 5 mu due to his work in the coal mine, taking into account both public and private affairs. The two sisters-in-law, Yi Zhonglian and Wei Aiqing, are each responsible for 3 mu. Zhang Wendou is working in the district and is not responsible for any land. This year, due to drought and poor harvests, it is estimated that they can produce 33.2 shi of grain, which, at an average of 3 dou per person per month, is only enough for the whole family to eat for the whole year. As for all the expenses for oil, salt, coal, cotton, and children's stationery (two children are in school), they are still short of 115,000 yuan. Therefore, they decided that in the second half of the year, in addition to the 82 workdays spent on agricultural production, the remaining workdays would be entirely devoted to textile and transportation. In addition to participating in the autumn harvest and wheat planting, Zhang Wenlie guarantees to earn 60,000 yuan by the end of the year through transportation and other sideline production. Zhang Wenhong guarantees to earn 30,000 yuan by taking advantage of spare time for transportation. Zhang Wendou guarantees to earn 20,000 yuan. In addition to participating in agricultural production and carrying water to make shoes, Yi Zhonglian guarantees to spin four taels of cotton per day, weave six bolts of cloth throughout the year, and earn 24,000 yuan. Hauling coal and transportation earns 30,000 yuan. Wei Aiqing, because she has a small child, does not transport, but guarantees to spin two taels of thread per day in addition to cooking, weave five bolts of cloth throughout the year, and earn 20,000 yuan. The 67-year-old mother, in addition to taking care of the child, spins one tael of thread per day and earns 20,000 yuan throughout the year. Secondly, the three families invested 38,900 yuan in the cooperative, which can generate 60,000 yuan in dividends. Eggs can generate an income of more than 10,000 yuan. The total income is 274,000 yuan. After deducting 115,000 yuan for miscellaneous expenses, there is still a surplus of 159,000 yuan. Each member of the family saves two liang of rice, and at the end of the year, they save 180 jin of rice, which can provide the whole family with 20 days of sustenance during lean times. Finally, Zhang Wendou and Yi Zhonglian were elected as the head and deputy head of the family, with the man in charge of external affairs and the woman in charge of internal affairs. They also jointly formulated a family covenant: 1. Persist in long-term thrift and oppose waste; 2. No fighting, no arguing, be willing to examine oneself, and offer suggestions to each other; 3. The head of the family must be democratic and consult with everyone on matters; 4. Each should do his or her best, cooperate, and complete the task with a 20-80 split in profit (80% for the public, 20% for the individual); any excess beyond the task belongs to the individual; 5. Hold a meeting every half month to report and commend.

　　张文洪弟兄召开家庭会议
  　十年分家再合居节约增产能发家
    【本报太岳十一日电】沁水松峪村已分居十年之张文洪兄弟三人，为实现节约生产计划，又实行合居。三人远在民国二十六年就分居，至今已整整十年，近因张文斗在区上工作，张文洪在煤窑合作社，以致照顾家庭不周全。上月二十四日张文斗从区上回来，召开家庭会议，并邀请村干部全体参加，三家把过去的毛病都作了深刻的检讨，随即张文斗女人卫爱卿提出：“要同居过活，才能发家”，张文烈女人奕仲莲立刻满脸带笑的插嘴说：我早已有心同居，政府今年号召节约，自家人口节约不多，俗话说“一锅费水，两锅费米”，“三人一条心，黄土变成金”，“合居人多力量大，发家有办法”，在这样情况下，全家九口人都说：“这个意见好”。于是正式实行合居，作了个精确的节约发家计划：
    全家共种地二十六亩，张文烈参战多，负担十五亩，张文洪因在煤窑工作，在公私兼顾下负担五亩，奕仲莲，卫爱卿妯娌二人各负担三亩，张文斗因在区里，不负担。今年因天旱歉收，预计能产粮三三·二石，按每人每月平均三斗计算，只够全家全年食用，至于一切油、盐、煤、棉花儿童文具（两个儿童念书）等花费，尚短洋一一五○○○元，所以他们决定后半年除农业生产用工八十二个外，其余余工完全搞纺织、运输。张文烈除参战秋收种麦外，保证年底运输和搞其他副业生产赚洋六万元。张文洪保证乘空运输赚洋三万元，张文斗保证赚洋二万元，奕仲莲除参加农业生产和担水做鞋外，保证每天纺花四两全年织布六匹赚洋二万四千元。驮炭运输赚洋三万元，卫爱卿因有小娃，不运输，保证做饭外，每日纺二两线全年织布五匹赚洋二万元。六十七岁老娘除看娃，每日纺一两线全年赚洋二万元，其次三家在合作社入股三万八千九百元，可收入红利六万元。鸡蛋可收入洋一万元以上，共计收入洋廿七万四千元，除弥补零费十一万五千元，尚余洋十五万九千元全家每人节约二两米，年底节约米一百八十斤，可供全家渡荒廿天。最后选张文斗、奕仲莲为正副家长，男管外女管里，并共同订出家庭公约：一、要长期节约，反对浪费；二、不争斗，不吵嘴，要虚心检讨，互相提意见；三、家长要民主，有事和大家商量；四、各尽其能，分工合作，完成任务二八分红（公八私二），超过任务归自己；五、半月开一次会，汇报表功等。
