Plain County recently held a teachers' training class. Due to the in-depth study of current affairs education, Tian Baojun, Li Dianxiu, Li Dongjin, and 83 others, who were Three Youth League members deceived and misled by Chiang's special agents in the past, as well as Liu Hongjie, Ma Xingren, Wei Xiangjiu, and 32 others, who were Kuomintang members, and Liu Yushui, Shao Huailin, Wang Jingao, and 3 others, from "gray organizations," began to awaken. They jointly sent a telegram accusing Chiang Kai-shek of his crimes, which read in part: "During the Anti-Japanese War, Chiang Kai-shek embraced a policy of non-resistance and plotted to harm the country by expanding the party and building up his army. He exhausted all means of intimidation, bribery, and shameless tactics, spreading his claws everywhere, causing us to be deceived and misled by him until today. Fortunately, our government rescued us from our mistakes, and taking advantage of the training opportunity, through painstaking persuasion and mobilization, we finally recognized the truth. Recalling our past actions, we betrayed the country and violated the people... Thinking of Bandit Chiang's use of special agents to deceive the youth in order to continue his bloody rule, causing the Chinese people to suffer displacement and pure youth to go astray... We are heartbroken and filled with grief and indignation. We hereby inform our compatriots across the country and democratic people around the world that we will use all our strength to deal with Bandit Chiang, demand blood debts from Bandit Chiang, dedicate ourselves to the patriotic self-defense war, and fight to the end for China's independence, peace, and democracy."
