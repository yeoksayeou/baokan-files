Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, September 25th: The American imperialists' plan to train Chiang Kai-shek's troops in Taiwan is being actively pursued. The Chiang bandits are attempting to use Taiwanese youth who were forcibly conscripted by the Japanese invaders to serve as cannon fodder. According to a Taipei dispatch from the Hong Kong Hua Shang Pao, cited by TASS from Nanjing on the 23rd, the Wedemeyer mission, after inspecting the ports of Keelung and Kaohsiung and other important land and air force bases in Taiwan, expressed general "satisfaction." The mission has agreed to Chiang Kai-shek's suggestion to actively train troops in Taiwan, and a concrete plan has been drafted and will soon be implemented. According to senior officials of the Taiwan Garrison Command, training will begin in October of this year, covering the army, navy, and air force. The first batch of trainees will be 200,000 Taiwanese youths aged 20 to 25, most of whom served in the Japanese special navy during the South Pacific campaign. Other trainees include aviation pilots called the "Army Volunteer Corps," who previously received flight training on Hainan Island. American officers and Japanese experts who have joined American citizenship will be responsible for army and air force training, while Japanese instructors will conduct navy training. According to reliable sources from Kaohsiung, southern Taiwan will be used as a military training base, and the headquarters commanding the training of troops will be moved to Tainan. According to another report from the newspaper, visitors from Taiwan stated that due to military setbacks in the Northeast, the (Chiang) government decided to transfer the reorganized 21st Division from Taiwan to North China, to be replaced by the Youth Army's 205th, 201st, and 202nd Divisions. The order has been issued, and the reorganized 21st Division will be transported as soon as the Youth Army arrives at the end of September. It is widely believed that the three Youth Army divisions "taking over" are also receiving American training and equipment.

    美日在台训练蒋匪
    图迫台湾青年充当炮灰
    【新华社陕北二十五日电】美国帝国主义在台湾训练蒋军之计划正积极进行中，蒋匪企图利用曾被日寇强迫服役的台湾青年充当炮灰。据塔斯社南京二十三日引香港华商报台北消息称：魏德迈代表团视察台湾基隆、高雄两港及其他重要陆空军基地后，大体表示“满意”，该团已同意蒋介石关于在台湾积极训练军队的建议，具体计划业已拟就，即将付诸实施。据台湾警备司令部高级官员谈称：训练将于今年十月开始，训练范围包括海陆空军。第一批受训者为年在二十至二十五岁之台湾青年二十万，彼等多数曾服役于南洋作战的日本特种海军中，其他受训者有被称为“陆军义勇队”的航空驾驶员，彼等以前曾在海南岛受过飞机驾驶训练。陆空军训练由美国军官及加入美国籍的日本专家担任，海军训练则由日本教官进行。据来自高雄可靠消息称：台湾南部将充作训练军队基地，指挥训练军队的总部将移往台南。据该报另一消息称：台湾来人谈，（蒋）政府因东北军事失利，决定将整编二十一师自台湾调往华北，而由青年军二○五、二○一、二○二三个师接防。现命令已下，一俟九月底青年军抵达后整编二十一师即行运送。众信“接防”的青年军三个师亦系接受美式训练及装备者。
