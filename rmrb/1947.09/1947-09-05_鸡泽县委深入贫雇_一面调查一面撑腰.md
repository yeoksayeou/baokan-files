[Transmitted by this newspaper reporter group on the 3rd] The Jize County Committee is conducting in-depth investigations into the extent of the peasants' emancipation, studying the problems left over from last year's review, and preparing for the major review this winter. Comrade × went to the villages of Futudian and Dongliuxia to visit poor peasants: "Have you thoroughly turned yourself over?" They all said, "We have turned over, we are stronger than before." Their words implied some dissatisfaction. Comrade × further visited the homes of poor peasants and found that a poor peasant named Gao with a family of four still lived in two thatched houses, with only two tattered quilts. Last year's review only allocated them 80 jin of grain, a cabinet, and half a room. He also visited six other poor peasant households, who similarly had not changed their houses. Comrade × asked the village cadres about these phenomena. Some village cadres said, "These people are very backward, they don't attend meetings, and they dismantled half of the house that was given to them." Comrade × then went to find the poor peasants. The son of a poor widow was sick and had no money for medicine, and was very worried. Comrade × cordially comforted her and advised her to boldly take her son to see a doctor and take medicine: "If you have no money, I will help you find a solution." He established a relationship with the old woman. She provided a lot of information, confirming Comrade ×'s initial impression was correct. Comrade × found the village cadres and said, "These people may have some minor problems, but we are responsible for reforming these people's problems and helping them to turn over, not ignoring them." "If their awareness is not enough, we are primarily responsible. In the past, we have not provided enough help to these people." "Our cadres have also gained too many fruits of struggle, should they also be considered backward?" These words helped these cadres increase their desire to reflect on themselves and reduced their resistance to direct, in-depth investigation and research by higher authorities among the poor and hired peasants. Comrade × then approached the hired peasants, using casual conversation to ask them how their lives were, how much land they were cultivating. After slowly becoming familiar, he asked, "How is your life compared to the landlords' lives?" The poor peasants began to talk about their grievances: "The three or five of us are not as good as one landlord's family!" "Even though I have a lot of land, I would trade five mu of my land for one mu of the landlord's, I guarantee I can make it work." Comrade × saw that there were quite a few problems and asked the village cadres to convene a meeting of more than 20 poor and hired peasant households. First, he supported everyone: "The army is our army, the county magistrate is working for the masses, what is there to be afraid of! You can say anything, don't hold back." Then, based on his own painful experience of working as a hired laborer for ten years, he enlightened the class consciousness of those present. They became courageous and provided many materials on the incomplete elimination of landlords and the unfair distribution of fruits of struggle. Comrade × advised them to go back and hold a family meeting to think carefully about what other materials they might have forgotten for a while. At this time, everyone's courage had been built up, and they no longer worried about retaliation from the cadres. One day, Comrade × was chatting casually at the home of hired laborer Wang Erhu when another hired laborer, Hei San, also came. The two men encouraged each other, recounting many grievances. Comrade × seized the opportunity and encouraged them: "Go and connect the poor people, collect more materials, and prepare for the struggle after the autumn harvest. From now on, everyone will decide on both the struggle and the distribution of the fruits of struggle." Comrade ×'s method of in-depth work among the poor and hired peasants not only obtained a large amount of materials, but also directly prepared the ideological ground for the major review this winter. When he talked to reporters about his main experience, he said: To conduct investigations, we must widely collect reflections from all aspects, the more the better; but we must take the opinions of the hired and poor peasants as the final basis. The investigation must not be limited to the circle of village cadres, nor can we completely abandon them, but we must use the relevant materials obtained from the investigation to educate them. Comrade ×'s investigation found three main problems: First, the landlords were not thoroughly struggled against. On average, each landlord retained good land that the poor people said "five mu could not be exchanged for one mu", and there were many internal possessions left over, with furniture and other items still richer than the peasants. Second, the poor and hired peasants were not thoroughly emancipated. Some said that they had a lot of land in terms of numbers, but the quality was poor. Some people's land was actually still the landlord's. The landlord heard the news of the struggle and "gave" the land to honest poor and hired peasants in advance, but the documents could not be "found". These peasants unconsciously became the landlord's "air raid shelter", making it even more difficult to turn over. The furniture, clothing and other items obtained by the poor and hired peasants were too few, and some were still borrowed from the landlords. Third, the cadres obtained more fruits of struggle, and there were some phenomena of protecting the landlords. According to the Jize County Committee, the above problems must be resolved in the major review this autumn by uniting all the peasants in the struggle against the landlords. According to past experience, as long as we truly and boldly grasp the eight characters of "poor and hired, let go, democracy, and fairness", the struggle will definitely be successful. (Zhuang)

　　鸡泽县委深入贫雇
  　一面调查一面撑腰
    【本报记者团三日电】鸡泽县委深入调查农民翻身程度，研究去年复查中遗留问题，给今冬大复查作准备。×同志到了浮图店、东柳下两村访问贫苦农民：“你们翻透了身没有？”他们都说：“翻身了，比过去强啦。”言中颇有不满足之意。×同志进一步去访问贫农家庭，发现一个姓高的贫农四口人仍住两间草房，只有两条破被，去年复查只分了八十斤粮食、一个立柜和半间房子。又访问了六户贫农，同样没有换房子。×同志以这些现象去问村干部，有些村干部说：“这些人都很落后，开会不到，分给他半间房子自己拆了”。×同志又去找来贫农。一个贫苦寡妇老太婆的儿子病了，没钱吃药，正在发愁。×同志亲切的慰问她，劝她大胆的给儿子看病吃药：“没有钱，我帮你想办法。”和老太婆建立了感情。她供给了许多材料，证实×同志最初的印象是对的。×同志找到村干部说：“这些人都可能有点小毛病，咱们是改造这些人的毛病，帮他翻身，不是不管他。”“他们觉悟不够，我们首先负责。过去我们对这些人的帮助非常不够。”“咱们干部也有多得斗争果实的，这叫不叫落后？”一席话说得这些干部助长了反省自己的要求，减低了对上级直接深入贫雇调查研究的抵抗情绪。×同志再去接近雇贫，采用闲扯的方法，问他们生活如何？种多少地？慢慢谈熟了，又问：“你们的生活比地主的生活怎么样？”贫农们开始谈起自己的委曲：“咱们三家、五家还不如地主一家！”“我的地看着不少了，我用五亩换地主一亩我保险干。”×同志看着问题相当多，让村干部召集了二十多户贫雇农开会，首先给大家撑腰：“军队是咱们的军队，县长是给群众办事的，还怕什么！有什么话都可说出来，一点不留。”接着就以自己当过十年雇工的痛苦经历，启发到会者的阶级觉悟。他们勇敢起来了，当场提供了许多地主消灭不彻底、果实分配不公的材料。×同志劝他们回去开个家庭会，好好想想，看还有些什么材料一时没有想到。这时大家的勇气都已鼓起，不再顾虑干部报复了。一天，×同志正在雇工王二虎家中闲谈，另一个雇工黑三也找来了。两个人你一言我一语的互相启示着，诉出许多委曲。×同志乘着热劲，鼓励他们：“去把穷人串通起来，再多搜集些材料，准备秋后斗争，今后不管斗争和分果实，都由大家作主。”×同志这种深入贫雇的工作方法，不但获得大量材料，而且直接给今冬复查作了思想准备。他对记者谈其主要经验时说：作调查要广泛搜集各方面的反映，越多越好；但是要以雇贫意见为最后的依据。调查绝不能限制在村干部的圈子里，也不可完全撇开他们，要以调查得来的有关材料对他们进行教育。×同志这次调查发现的主要问题有三种：第一、地主斗的尚不彻底。每人平均留有穷人所谓“五亩都换不到一亩”的好地，内财遗留很多，家具等物仍较农民丰富。第二、贫雇翻身不透。有的在数目上说土地已经不少，但质量较坏，有些人的土地实际上仍是地主的，地主听到斗争风声，事先把地“送”给老实贫雇，但是文书找“不到了”，这些农民不自觉的当了地主的“防空洞”，翻身更加困难，贫雇所得家具、衣服等物太少，有些还是地主借给的。第三、干部分得果实多，并有若干包庇地主的现象。据鸡泽县委谈；以上问题，都要在今秋大复查时团结全体农民一致对地主斗争中解决。根据过去经验，只要真正大胆的掌握住“贫雇、放手、民主、公道”八个大字，斗争一定会搞好的。（庄）
