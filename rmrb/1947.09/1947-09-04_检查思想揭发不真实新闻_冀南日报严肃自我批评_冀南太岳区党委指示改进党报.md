　　Inspect Thoughts and Expose Untrue News
  　Ji'nan Daily Conducts Serious Self-Criticism
    Ji'nan-Taiyue District Party Committee Instructs Improvement of Party Newspaper
    [Ji'nan, September 2nd Dispatch from This Newspaper] As the "September 1st" holiday and the second anniversary of the Ji'nan Daily's resumption of publication approach, the Ji'nan Daily and the Ji'nan Xinhua Branch have begun to examine their stance and work style. Preliminary findings reveal a serious "speculative" phenomenon. Whether in the work of editors and reporters or in the reports of correspondents, whether the news is commendatory or critical, there are untrue and irresponsible facts such as catching shadows based on hearsay and one-sided exaggeration. In the editorial work, a few facts were expanded to represent the whole. The materials on production mutual aid from five or six villages in five counties of the Fourth Special District were summarized as "universal production mutual aid in the Fourth Special District." In broadcasting manuscripts from the head office and branch offices, the review of individual new areas and individual old areas was combined into "new and old areas restart struggle and carry out review." Reports of soaking rain in some areas were reported as "general rains in southern Hebei." The Ninth Sub-district suffered from severe drought without rain, and the masses were tensely engaged in drought resistance and famine preparedness. When we received such manuscripts, we thought there had been a general soaking rain, so we subjectively deleted the word "drought resistance" and changed it to "thrift" in preparation for famine. In our interview work, we reported the resolutions discussed by the masses as the actions of the masses. For example, the masses in Ganji, Weixian County, discussed ways to save money by abstaining from smoking and alcohol, but it was reported as action. The establishment of a new village in Jize (Xin Fengzheng and Happiness Village) was hearsay and did not happen. In the reports of correspondents, the report about Qi Xishun, the director of the Farmers' Association in Mishijie, Linqing Third District, moving his home was an exaggerated report. The incident of the "Ji-Lu-Yu Store" stationed in Linqing eating and drinking extravagantly during the New Year festival was also untrue. When Nangong sent out stretchers, district cadre Zhang Xixuan did not go on the expedition, but the report said he did. The project of managing the river in Renxian County was completed in five days instead of ten, and Jia Fengling from Zhaolou Village in Jingxian County carried 70,000 jin of soil in one day, and each elementary school student dug 20,000 jin per day, which is hard to believe. Another example is a correspondent in Guangzong reported how Wang Chaozhu led the formulation of a wheat harvest plan and combined it with the merit campaign, but after sending a reporter to investigate, it turned out to be untrue, and Chaozhu was not even at home at the time (this manuscript was not adopted). The above is just what is known; there must be many more undiscovered untrue news stories. The reason for these phenomena is that some comrades only want their manuscripts to be published in the newspaper, lacking a sense of responsibility to the people and the Party. In particular, the editorial work is rough and careless, and they do not carefully handle each manuscript with a serious spirit of responsibility to the Party and the people, which allows some untrue news to enter the territory of the Party newspaper.
    [Ji'nan, September 2nd Dispatch from This Newspaper] The Ji'nan District Party Committee put forward opinions on improving the Party newspaper on the "September 1st" holiday. It called on all news professionals and Party newspaper correspondents in the district to use the weapon of self-criticism to examine the Party newspaper (including local and county small newspapers), and called on the entire Party to mobilize and cooperate with the broad masses to supervise the news reports of the Party newspaper. Those who report untruthfully and whose stance is unstable will be exposed and reported, and a mass inspection movement will be launched. It also called on Party committees at all levels to earnestly cultivate a large number of worker-peasant correspondents (including poor peasants, emancipated leaders, and district and village cadres) in this review, so that the Party newspaper can truly become a powerful weapon that comes from the masses and can effectively guide and promote work.
    [Taiyue, September 2nd Dispatch from This Newspaper] The Propaganda Department of the Taiyue District Party Committee, in order to further improve the Party newspaper, issued a call on "September 1st": (1) All county and district small newspapers, the Taiyue Xinhua Daily, and all comrades engaged in news work should universally launch a movement to examine their thoughts, examine our remaining landlord thoughts, and examine our "speculative" style. (2) Implement the spirit of the whole Party running newspapers and the masses running newspapers, everyone should write, actively contribute, and expand our communication network, especially to develop and train worker-peasant-soldier correspondents, so that our Party newspaper can better combine with reality and better serve the masses.

### 检查思想揭发不真实新闻　冀南日报严肃自我批评  冀南太岳区党委指示改进党报

　　检查思想揭发不真实新闻
  　冀南日报严肃自我批评
    冀南太岳区党委指示改进党报
    【本报冀南二日电】冀南日报及冀南新华分社于“九一”节及冀南日报复刊二周年将临之际，开始检查立场与工作作风，初步发现严重的存在着“客落空”现象，无论在编辑、记者工作中及通讯员的报导中，无论属于表扬或批评的新闻，都有捕风捉影、道听途说、片面夸大等不真实不负责任的事实。在编辑工作中，曾将少数的事实扩大为全体。四专署五个县五、六个村生产互助的材料，即综合为“四专区普遍生产互助”。在播发总分社的稿子中，曾将个别新区与个别老区的复查综合为“新老区重起斗争开展复查”。部分地区的落透雨，报导为“冀南普降甘霖”。九分区苦旱不雨，群众正紧张抗旱备荒，当我们收到此类稿件时，以为普落透雨了，即主观的删去“抗旱”字样，改为“节约”备荒。在我们采访工作中，曾将群众讨论的决议报导为群众的行动。如威县干集群众节约戒烟酒，仅仅讨论出办法，便报导为行动了。鸡泽建立新村（新风正与快乐村）则是道听途说，并无其事。在通讯员同志的报导中，如报导临清三区米市街农会主任齐西顺搬家一稿，其事实即系夸大报导。过年节时驻临清“冀鲁豫商店”大吃大喝一事，也不确实。南宫出担架时，区干张熹轩亦未出征，但报导　却说他去了。任县治河十天工程五天完成，景县赵楼村贾凤龄一天担土七万斤，每个小学生每天挖两万斤等，事实很难令人相信。又如广宗一通讯员报导王朝柱如何领导订出麦收计划及与立功运动结合，后经派记者调查，并无其事，且朝柱当时还未在家（此稿未采用）。以上所述，仅为已知者；未经揭露的不真实新闻，当还很多。所以产生这些现象，其原因就是在某些同志思想上只是单纯的为求报纸刊发自己的稿件，缺乏对人民、对党负责的精神，特别是编辑工作粗枝大叶，没有严重的以对党对人民负责的精神精细的处理每一篇稿件，致使某些不真实的新闻钻进了党报的地盘。
    【本报冀南二日电】冀南区党委于“九一”节提出关于改进党报意见。号召全区一切新闻工作专业者及党报通讯员，以自我批评的武器，来检查党报（包括地、县小报），号召全党动员与配合广大群众，监督党报的新闻报导。对报导失实及立场不稳者，予以揭发检举，开展群众性的检查运动。并号召各级党，在此次复查中，认真培养大批工农通讯员，（包括贫苦农民、翻身领袖、区村干部）使党报真正成为从群众中来，而又能切实指导与推动工作的有力武器。
    【本报太岳二日电】太岳区党委宣传部，为了进一步办好党报，特于“九、一”发出号召：（一）各县区小报，太岳新华日报以及全体从事新闻工作的同志，普遍展开一个检查思想运动，检查我们残存的地主思想，检查我们“客里空”作风。（二）贯彻全党办报、群众办报的精神，大家动笔，踊跃写稿，扩大我们的通讯网，尤其是要发展与培养工农兵通讯员，使我们的党报更好的与实际结合，更好的为群众办事。
