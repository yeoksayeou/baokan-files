　　Four Forms of Mutual Aid Production Among Xingtai Citizens

　　Xingtai City has organized citizens' mutual aid production, creating four forms of mutual aid suitable for urban characteristics and the needs of citizens. (1) Zhang Zhihua's Four-Person Production Department: Consisting of four people. In the past, each had different occupations. Starting from the first month of the lunar year, they borrowed 100,000 yuan from the bank and started a scrap collection stall together. Each of the four people has their strengths. Zhang Zhihua is upright and can unite everyone; Guo Jinde is very familiar with commercial business; Li Laohei is honest and reliable, best at watching the stall; Xu Zhenshen is diligent in running errands. The four people cooperated wholeheartedly, and by April, it had grown to 800,000 yuan. The four reached an agreement that they would not withdraw shares from the profits, but use the profits as capital, determined to expand the business. Seeing what the farmers needed at the market, they supplied those goods. When the production season arrived, they changed from a scrap stall to selling iron goods such as plowshares. After Yangquan was recovered, they went to sell iron pots, which was very profitable. This group also went to support small mutual aid groups. Some groups had small capital and were unable to cover their expenses when buying goods themselves, so they bought on their behalf without any charge, only charging some freight. They bought cheap goods and often wholesaled them to other groups. If the groups did not have cash, they could pay back after making money. Within the group, a bonus and criticism system was established, so everyone was very united. The characteristic of this group is that it completely combines capital, technology, and labor, self-employed and self-managing, leveraging everyone's strengths and converting their business according to market needs at any time. (2) Fan Zhongtian's Peace Production Department: Led by Fan Zhongtian, the director of the Militia Committee of Malu Street, composed of many militiamen. These people were all rickshaw workers in the past, but have now changed careers. All twenty-one people contributed some money as shares, the amount being very small. Eight people manage the daily business in the department, and the department provides meals. Each person receives a monthly salary of two dou of rice, and the profits are divided on a 20/80 basis (the eight people share 20%, the department gets 80%). The others run their own small businesses, such as scrap collection stalls. If individuals have financial difficulties, the department helps solve them. The characteristic of this mutual aid group is that it can concentrate the small capital of poor citizens to operate larger-scale production, and use collective strength to help private production. (3) Fan Lianzeng's Mutual Aid Group: Led by Fan Lianzeng, consisting of three small hemp rope shops. In the past, the three families each set up their own rope stalls. Now, they have a unified stall, and two people sell the goods of the three families at the market. This saves fifty-four man-days per month, which are used for spinning rope, and can earn an extra 39,000 yuan per month. The mutual aid group collectively purchases raw materials, saving labor and money. Everyone works together, helping and competing with each other. Fan Qian increased production from seven or eight jin of rope per day to twelve or thirteen jin. And in mutual assistance, they improved their technology. Its characteristic is that it fully utilizes the effectiveness of labor and technical cooperation, and can gradually move towards capital cooperation. (4) Malu Street People's Cooperative: After the citizens were emancipated, they widely raised funds to establish a cooperative, which is operated by dedicated personnel. Sixty-eight households have already invested 3 million yuan. Its main role is to help the orphaned, widowed, elderly, and young who have no labor force, as well as poor citizens who do not know how to run a business, solve their living problems, absorb their emancipation money to generate profits, and then use capital transportation and sales methods to help them spin cotton or set up small stalls to ensure their lives. In the past six months, Xingtai's mutual aid production has gradually shown that it is the best production method for citizens. Malu Street has a total of 681 households, and 40 groups have been organized, with more than half of the households participating. According to the existing materials, as long as the leadership is proper, it will gradually develop. (Li Zhuang)

　　邢台市民的互助生产四种形式
    邢台市组织市民互助生产，已创造四种适合城市特点及市民需要的互助形式。（一）张桎华的四合生产部，共四个人。过去各有不同的职业，从正月起，向银行贷款十万元，合伙摆一个破烂摊。四个人各有所长，张桎华为人正派，能团结大家；郭金德对商业业务非常熟悉；李老黑忠厚老实，看摊子最好；许振善亲跑外。四个人同心合作，到四月，发展到八十万元，四个人取得协议，赚了钱都不抽股，将利作本，决心把生意闹大。他们看着赶集的农民需要什么，就办什么货。生产季节到了，改摆破烂摊为贩卖犁铧等铁货。阳泉收复了，他们去贩铁锅，非常赚钱。这个组又去扶植小互助组。有些组本钱小，自己出去办货，赚的钱还不够盘费，他们即无代价的代买，只收一些运费。他们买了便宜货，常常批发给其他小组，小组没有现钱，可以赚了钱再还帐。在组内则建立了分红奖励及批评制度，因此大家非常齐心。这个组的特点，是把资本、技术、劳力完全结合起来，自东自伙，发挥大家所长，随时根据市场的需要，转换自己的业务。（二）范中天的和平生产部，由马路街武委会主任范中天领导许多民兵组成。这些人过去都是洋车工人，现在都转了业，二十一人都入了些钱股，数目很小。有八个人在部里经营日常业务，部里管饭。每人月支工资米二斗，赚的钱二八分红（八个人共分十分之二，部得十分之八），其他人各自经营自己的小职业。如摆破烂摊等，各人资金发生困难，部里帮助解决。这种互助组的特点，是能集中贫苦市民微小的资本，经营比较大的生产。并以集体的力量帮助私人生产。（三）范连增的互助组，由范连增领导三个小麻绳铺组成。过去三家各摆各的绳摊，现在一个总摊，过集两个人伙卖三家的货。每月能省五十四个人工，用以纺绳，每月可多赚三万九千元。互助组集体购买原料，省工又省钱，大家在一起工作，互助竞赛。范牵由过去每人每天纺七、八斤绳，增至十二、三斤。并在互相帮助中，提高了技术。它的特点是，充分发挥劳力技术合作的效能，可逐渐走向资本的合作。（四）马路街平民合作社。市民翻身后，广泛召募资金成立合作社，由专人经营，已有六十八户入股三百万元。它的主要作用，是帮助无劳力的孤寡老幼及不会经营的贫苦市民解决生活问题，吸收他们的翻身款生利，再以资金运销等方法，帮助他们纺花或摆小摊，以保障他们的生活。半年以来，邢市的互助生产已逐渐显示出它是市民最好的生产方式，马路街共有六百八十一户，已经组织起四十个组，参加户数在二分之一以上。照现有材料看来，只要领导得法，它是会逐步发展的。（李庄）
