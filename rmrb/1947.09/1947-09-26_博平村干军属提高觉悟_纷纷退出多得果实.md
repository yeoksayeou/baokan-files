Boping Village Cadres and Military Dependents Raise Awareness, Voluntarily Return Excess Gains

[This newspaper's Ji-Lu-Yu dispatch dated the 24th] Since Boping County's model hero conference in mid-August, which established Li Zhao'an Village's "comparing poverty and complaining about suffering," the middle peasants have consciously decided not to divide the fruits, and the poor peasants have been helping the middle peasants achieve merit. The method of distributing fruits based on "what's lacking, what's supplemented," breaking down class distinctions, has become the county's direction for filling poverty pits and distributing fruits. In various villages, large numbers of village cadres, activists, and military personnel have voluntarily returned excess gains. Yu Qinghang, the instructor of Liang Village in the Fifth District, was extremely poor. Previously, he had filled more than middle peasants. This time, in the "comparing poverty and complaining about suffering" process, before some poverty pits were even filled, he voluntarily returned 2.5 mu of land that he had gained in excess. Influenced by his exemplary actions, military dependent Lu Zhaocheng also returned 8.5 mu of land that he had been allocated in excess. In Zhu Qihu Village in the Fourth District, the fruits of the previous struggle totaled 286 mu, 9 cows, and 8 carts. The village chief, Zhu Shangde, and 10 other village cadres divided 101 mu of land, 4 cows, and 5 carts, and also secretly divided 8 bundles. The reports from advanced villages at the hero conference greatly enlightened them. After returning to the village, they held a three-day self-criticism meeting, criticizing that the reason why the village's work had not been good in the past was because the village cadres had divided too many fruits, so the masses were naturally not motivated to work. Thus, the village cadres' thinking was cleared, and they decided to return the excess gains. At the farmers' meeting, Village Chief Zhu Shangde took the lead and announced, "In the past, I divided five mu of land and one bundle in excess. Today, I am taking out all the excess gains. Everyone can decide how to deal with me." Following this, 10 village cadres voluntarily returned the excess gains, which also prompted three militiamen to confess. Niu Yongze, a military man from Niuzhuang in the Tenth District, had a family of four and was allocated more than 19 mu of land. This time, after his son returned from the army, when the father and son were chatting about their family's emancipation, they learned that the land had yielded 28 bags of grain, which was more than enough for the family of four to eat. Others had only been allocated 3 mu of land, and some people's poverty pits had not yet been filled. Yongze thought, "We are eating our fill now, but we can't forget our poor brothers." The father and son's thoughts were aligned, and they contributed 3.8 mu of land at the district's activists' meeting. Liu Farui, the chairman of Luozhuang in the Tenth District, reflected when he returned the excess gains at the mass meeting, "In the past, I was very selfish and thought that I was the one leading the struggle, so I could take more. The members only received 30 jin of grain each, while I took 450 jin. Now, in the comparing poverty and complaining about suffering process, my suffering is not even as great as others. I should not have taken more, so I firmly decided to distribute the excess gains to the masses." After the village cadres and military dependents voluntarily returned the excess gains, it greatly excited the masses.

    博平村干军属提高觉悟
    纷纷退出多得果实
    【本报冀鲁豫二十四日电】博平自八月中旬全县英模大会树立李招安庄比贫诉苦，中农自觉不分果实，贫农给中农立功，打破等级，以缺啥补啥的分果实办法，成为全县填穷坑分果实的方向后，各村普遍出现大批村干、积极分子、军人自觉的退出多占果实。五区梁庄村指导员于清航，是个赤贫，以前填的比中农还高，这次在比苦诉苦中，有的穷坑还没填，他自动的退出多占的土地二亩半。在他的模范行动影响下，军属卢昭成也退出多分的土地八亩半。四区朱齐胡村，上次斗争的果实共二百八十六亩，九头牛，车八辆，村长朱尚德等十个村干便分了一百零一亩地，牛四头，车五辆，还偷分了八个包袱。在英雄大会上，先进村的汇报给他们的启迪很大。回村后，召开了三天的检讨会，检讨出过去咱庄上工作不好是因为村干多分果实，群众当然不起劲干。于是村干思想打通了，决定退出多占果实。在召开农民大会上，村长朱尚德第一带头自报：“过去我多分了五亩地，一个包袱，我今天把多占的果实都拿出来了，大家愿意怎样处理就处理我。”接着十个村干都自觉退出多占果实，又引起三个民兵自报。十区牛庄军人牛永泽，四口人，共分得十九亩多地。这次他儿从队伍回来后，在爹俩拉着翻身家常时，知道地里打了二十八布袋粮，一家四口人吃不了，别人又分三亩地，有些人的穷坑还未能填。永泽想咱吃饱饭啦，可不能忘掉穷兄弟。爹俩思想通了，在全区积极分子会上献出三亩八分地。十区罗庄的会长刘法瑞在群众会上退出多占果实时，反省说：“过去我自己自私心很大，认为是我领导着斗出来的东西，可以多要点，会员们每个人才分卅斤粮食，我独吞了四百五十斤。现在在诉苦比苦中我的苦还没别人大，我不应该多要，因此我坚决把多占果实分给群众。”在村干军属自报退出多占果实后，引起群众很大的兴奋。
