  　Cleanses Elements Who Betrayed the People
    [Our Dispatch] The Ji-Lu-Yu Postal Bureau recently dismissed Wang Jian, who shielded landlords and suppressed the masses, and handed him over to the masses for handling. Wang Jian is from Sheping. He started working in 1939 and is currently a line inspector in the district bureau. His family composition changed from a bankrupt landlord to a poor peasant. During the land reform, he was allocated 21 mu of land, 300 jin of red grain, 500 jin of wheat, and a lot of utensils, bricks, and beams. His grandfather was a Qing dynasty military scholar who often frequented officialdom to frame cases, a typical figure of the ruling class. His mother was the daughter of an executioner and a female tyrant in the village. His third younger brother served as a puppet soldier and seized a wife while in the Third Detachment, also a petty tyrant. Wang Jian not only did not repay the many fruits he received from the masses but turned around to defend the landlords and bite the masses. He gave his gun to his third brother to intimidate the masses, so his mother and third brother, posing as family members of revolutionary soldiers, relied on Wang Jian's "power" to run rampant in the village and act arbitrarily. Wang Jian was also as close as family with Wang Mingrang, a landlord in the village, because Wang protected his family from losses when Wang was in the Central Army in the past. Wang Jian was deeply grateful and wanted to "repay kindness with kindness," proposing: "You protected me before, and I will definitely protect you in the future." When the democratic government asked Wang to be tried, Wang used this to write protection letters to shield the landlord from attending government training. Wang Jian also went home privately on July 23rd, listened to his mother's one-sided story, and supported Wang Mingrang in suppressing the mass movement. The masses were very afraid of him, giving preferential treatment to resistance soldiers during festivals, giving each family three jin of meat, and secretly giving him 28 jin of pork. His mother still complained that it was too little and had bones. Therefore, the masses at that time reflected: "Others have triple insurance, but Wang Jian has quadruple insurance: the traitor team, the Third Detachment, the Central Army, and the Eighth Route Army." The masses hated him to the bone. As the land reform movement deepened, the masses' awareness increased, and they first struggled against Wang's family. Wang Jian himself was still not aware of the situation. The bureau decided to dismiss him and hand him over to the masses for handling, and issued instructions to the entire region to show strict punishment for violating discipline and safeguarding the interests of the masses.

　　冀鲁豫邮局
  　清洗背叛人民分子
    【本报讯】冀鲁豫邮政局，最近已将包庇地主镇压群众的王健撤消工作交群众处理。王健社平人，一九三九年即参加工作，现任区局干线检查员，家庭由破落地主降为贫农成份。土改中还分得土地二十一亩，红粮三百斤，麦子五百斤，及用具、砖、梁等甚多。他祖父是个前清武秀才，经常走官场架案子，是一个典型的统治人物，母亲是个刽子手的女儿，在村内则是女恶霸，他三弟当过伪军，在三支队时抢了一个媳妇，也是一个小恶霸。王健得到群众的许多果实不但有恩不报，不积极改造自己家庭，反而回过头来，维护地主咬群众，把自己的枪给了他三弟威吓群众，于是他母与三弟以抗属自居，依仗王健之“势力”在村内横行霸道，任意胡为。王健并与该村地主王明让亲如一家人，因王某在过去当中央军时，曾保护过他家庭未受损失，王健感恩非浅，要“以恩报恩”，提出：“以前你保护我，以后我一定保护你”。当民主政府叫王某受审时，王某就用以写保护掩护地主不到政府受训。王健并于七月二十三日私自回家，听其母一面之词，给王明让撑腰镇压群运，群众非常害怕他，过节优抗，每家肉三斤，暗暗地给他二十八斤猪肉，他母亲还嫌少，嫌有骨头，所以当时群众反映出：“别人三保险，只有王健是四保险：汉奸队、三支队、中央军、八路军”。群众恨之入骨，在土改运动逐步深入中，群众觉悟提高，先对王之家庭进行斗争，王健本人在此情况下仍不觉悟，该管理局遂决定撤消工作交群众处理外，并训令全区，以示严惩纪律，维护群众利益。（陈彬）
