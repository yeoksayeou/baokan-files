    Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 26th. The local armed forces of Liaoji Province, active along the Liao River on the western side of the Changchun-Dalian Railway, advanced into Tieling on the 14th and attacked the Kuomintang-puppet troops at Shuangshuzi. After four hours of fighting, they defeated a part of the enemy's New Sixth Army and the Tieling puppet security force, totaling more than 200 men, killing and wounding over 40 enemy soldiers, including a company commander and below, and capturing 13. On the 3rd, our unit penetrated the enemy's rear in the Sanmianchuan area of Faku, severely打击 ("severely struck") the reactionary landlord armed force "Lianzhuanghui," killing over 30 bandits and puppets. A unit of the Inner Mongolia People's Self-Defense Army, on August 28th in the Gongzhutun area on the west bank of the Liao River, defeated over 300 men from the Xinmin County Security Brigade, capturing over 50 and killing and wounding 16.

    Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 26th. Desertion is rampant among the Kuomintang troops in the southern section of the Changchun-Dalian Railway. The 49th Army of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits, recently reinforced in the Northeast, also showed a strong trend of fleeing before being annihilated. One company of the 314th Regiment of its 105th Division, originally with more than 150 soldiers, is now left with less than 60. When the 29th Regiment, belonging to the 8th Security Zone of the Kuomintang-puppet Northeast, was transferred from Anshan to Tieling for reorganization, more than 60 of its 120 soldiers in one company deserted. In the areas of Jidong, Fengrun, and Luanan, more than 1,000 Kuomintang-puppet soldiers have defected to the Liberated Areas under the political offensive and "wiping out the black spots" efforts of our army. According to deserters, "Chiang's army has not yet received winter clothing this year, and the summer clothes worn by ordinary soldiers are already tattered." They also said, "Officers often deduct soldiers' pay in the name of 'dining together'. Soldiers are dissatisfied, and desertion is increasing day by day."

    Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 26th. In the deepening movement to dig out bad roots in various parts of the Northeast, Kuomintang special agents, bandit leaders, and local bullies hiding in the countryside are constantly being dug out by the peasants who have turned over. Wang Hongbin, commander of the Kuomintang bandit Northeast Advance Army Column, was recently dug out in the Taha District of Longtong County, Nenjiang Province. Liu Changren of the Third Detachment and Zou Weifu, a former councilor of the "剿赤军" ("Anti-Red Army") in Hebei Province, and over 30 others were also dug out. In the process of digging out bad roots, the ill-gotten wealth of the local bullies uncovered in just nine villages exceeded 10,000,000 yuan, and more than 500 *qiang* (a unit of land measurement) of black land and more than 300 *qiang* of green crops were found and distributed to the poor masses.
