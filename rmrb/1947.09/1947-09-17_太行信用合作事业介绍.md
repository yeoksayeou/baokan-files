　　Introduction to the Taihang Credit Cooperative Enterprise
　　Taihang Branch

This year, rural credit lending work in the Taihang region has seen significant development. The number of credit cooperatives in the entire region has grown from only 56 last year to 609 now. The total capital has reached 250 million yuan. According to statistics from 477 credit cooperatives in 25 counties, the total grain and cash deposits of the masses amount to 118.77 million yuan in silver dollars. The credit cooperatives in the entire region have issued a total of 400 million yuan in loans, playing a significant role in organizing mass production and overcoming famine. The seven credit cooperatives in Shahe have lent a total of more than 30.41 million yuan in silver dollars to the masses. The masses have bought back 196 head of livestock, 24 carts, repaired 27 carts, bought 9 waterwheels, repaired 13, and bought sheep, pigs, weaving machines, cotton gins, spinning wheels, and agricultural implements, greatly invigorating rural finance.

The emergence and development of credit cooperation is the result of a long process of exploration. Before the establishment of credit cooperatives, some cooperatives that had close ties with the masses, and individual members of mutual aid societies, when they had difficulties, would request interest-free assistance from the cooperatives. For example, the Xiahe Village Cooperative in Wuxiang lent a total of 1.00 million yuan in silver dollars to the masses 150 times from May of last year to April of this year, including 229,000 yuan for individuals to buy livestock, 348,000 yuan for mutual aid societies to buy livestock and other items, 50,000 yuan for five households to hold funerals and six households to get married, and 300,000 yuan for the masses to pay for medical treatment, buy cloth, transportation, travel expenses for official business and participation in war, and daily miscellaneous expenses. However, the cooperative's funds belong to a portion of the masses (members), and widely providing interest-free assistance to the masses makes the members feel dissatisfied. This gave rise to the concept of interest. For example, the Weijiazhuang Cooperative in Lucheng stipulated that interest would be charged at half a percent per month for loans exceeding one month. In the cooperative, sometimes when turnover was difficult, some would also ask the masses for assistance or loans. The masses, possessing savings in money and goods, were also willing to lend to the cooperative to avoid waste and the trouble of safekeeping. For example, the masses in Huangluzhan, Xiyang, deposited goods worth 430,000 yuan in silver dollars into the cooperative in half a year. This type of deposit is in the nature of pooling idle funds. This was the germination of the credit cooperative.

Bank loans also greatly promoted the credit business. In the past, loans were simply issued with a focus on key areas. In the last two years, it has been discovered that the best way to accurately use loans to develop production and achieve this goal is to conduct investigations and research to understand the production funds of the masses, and the best way to achieve this goal is to issue loans through village cooperatives. This was the beginning of cooperatives handling credit lending. From the above two aspects of exploration, both leaders and the masses deeply realized that "developing production requires the establishment of credit cooperation."

At present, there are basically two types of credit cooperatives: First, establishing a credit department within the cooperative, but this must be a cooperative with the correct business direction. Its source of funds is partly from the cooperative, partly from the bank (issuing loans on behalf of the bank), and mainly relies on absorbing idle funds from the masses. It is a component of the cooperative, but the funds are independent and the business is specialized. The cooperative provides assistance when it has difficulties, but its business is generally consistent with that of the cooperative. Second, operating independently and raising shares separately. The main source of funds is absorbing idle funds from the masses. This type of credit cooperative is suitable for market towns and areas formed by the combination of natural economies. Because these areas have more developed industry and commerce, it is easier to trade goods, and the masses have higher demands for deposits and loans. It is not easy to organize in general rural areas.

The experience of the past year has proved that the business direction of credit cooperatives should be to fully organize mass production. This is reflected in two aspects. First, in organizing deposits, absorbing the masses' savings of real objects and cash, to make the best use of things, to profit from all aspects of organizing mass production, and to open up sources of deposits. For example, the North Zhang Village Credit Cooperative in Shahe organized the masses to make military shoes and uniforms, and the wages earned were deposited into the credit cooperative. A certain village credit department in Gaoyi organized 100 women to spin and weave, earning 100,000 yuan, all of which went into the credit cooperative. The Baichi Village in Huguan organized more than 20 primary school students to pick up scrap iron from nearby iron factories during their spare time, sell it, and deposit the money into the credit cooperative, making themselves completely self-sufficient for tuition fees. Second, in terms of lending, for example, the Dongfengren Credit Cooperative in Xiyang absorbed a large amount of grain deposits from the masses and quickly lent it to the masses to buy livestock and organize transportation to earn money to repay the loans.

The operating principle of credit cooperatives should be everyone gathering shares, everyone operating, and everyone using. Everything should proceed from the actual interests of the masses, and everything should be discussed and decided by the masses. For example, in the interest rate issue in credit activities, many places have adopted the method of discussing and specifically deciding on the basis of local production conditions and borrowing habits. The practice of Cixian, Huixian, and Wu'an counties in the Fifth Special District is: generally adopting demand deposits, regardless of time, depositing and withdrawing in small amounts, not afraid of trouble, guaranteeing credit, which is very popular among the masses. In this summer's saving and disaster preparedness, the Huangshan Village Credit Cooperative in Huguan adapted to the demands of the masses and re-stipulated the method of storing grain and cotton. The principle is to deposit what you take out, but the interest rate has been increased. The monthly interest rate for storing cotton is half a tael per catty, with a term of three months, and the monthly interest rate for storing grain is six and a half catties per hundred catties, also limited to three months, which the masses are also very satisfied with.

　　太行信用合作事业介绍
    太行分社
    太行农村信用借贷工作今年有很大发展。全区信用社去年只有五十六个，现在已发展到六百零九个。资金达二万万五千余万元。据二十五县四百七十七个信用社统计，群众存粮存款共合洋一万万一千八百七十七万元。全区信用社共发放贷款四万万元，在组织群众生产渡荒中起了极大作用。沙河七个信用社，共贷给群众大洋三千零四十一万余元，群众共买回牲口一百九十六头，大车廿四辆，修大车二十七辆，买水车九部，修十三部，买羊、猪、织布机、轧花车、纺花车及农具等大大活泼了农村金融。
    信用合作的产生与发展，是经过长期的摸索过程。当信用社未成立前，有些与群众关系密切的合作社，群众个人与互助社有困难时，曾要求合作社无利借助。如武乡下合村合作社，去年五月到今年四月，共借助给群众一百五十次共大洋一百万元，其中用于私人买牲口的二十二万九千元，互助社买牲口及其他东西，用大洋三十四万八千元，有五户办丧事、六户结婚，共借洋五万元，借给群众医病、买布、运输、支差参战盘费及日用零支等大洋三十万元。但合作社资金是部分群众（社员）的，广泛地无利给群众借助，社员就感不满，这样就产生了利息关系，如潞城魏家庄合作社规定，借钱超过一月者以分半计息。在合作社，有时周转不通，也有的向群众要求借助或借贷的时候，群众保有积存钱物，为避免浪费与保管麻烦，也愿借给合作社，如昔阳黄路站群众半年内存入合作社的钱物合洋四十三万元。这种存物，即是汇集游资的性质。这便是信用社的萌芽。
    银行的贷款对于用信事业也有很大的推动作用。过去只是有重点的单纯发放贷款，最近两年才摸索到，只有先进行调查研究，了解了群众生产资金情况，才能将贷款准确的用到发展生产上，达到这一目的最好的办法是把贷款通过村合作社去发放，这便是合作社办理信用借贷的开始。从以上这两方面的摸索，使领导与群众，都深深体会到“发展生产，必须建立信用合作”。
    目前的信用社基本上有两种类型：一，在合作社内建立信用部，但这必须是业务方向正确的合作社。其资金来源是由合作社抽出一部、银行出一部（替银行发贷款），主要靠吸收群众游资。它是合作社的一个组成部分，但资金是独立的、业务亦是专营的。在其有困难时，合作社给以帮助，但它的业务一般也是与合作社一致的。二，单独经营，单独集股。资金来源主要是吸收群众游资，这种信用社，宜于集镇及自然经济联合组成的区域。因为这些地区，工商业较发达，物资吞吐较容易，群众存款与放款的要求较高。一般农村是不易组织的。
    一年来的经验证明了，信用社的业务方向，应是全力地组织群众生产。这表现在两个方面。一是在组织存款上，吸收群众积存的实物与现款，达到物尽其用，从各方面组织群众生产获利，开辟存款来源。如沙河北掌村信用社，组织群众做军鞋、军衣，所得工资都存入信用社。高邑某村信用部组织一百个妇女纺织，赚洋十万元，全入了信用社。壶关百尺村组织小学生二十余人，课余到附近铁厂拾漏铁，卖了将钱存入信用社，学费完全自给。二是在放款上，如昔阳东丰稔信用社大量吸收群众存粮，很快又贷给群众买牲口，组织运输，赚钱还贷款。
    信用社的经营路线应是大家集股，大家经营，大家使用。一切从群众实际利益出发，一切是群众讨论决定。比如信用活动中的利息问题，许多地方都是采取了按当地生产情况、借贷习惯，由群众讨论，具体决定。五专区磁县、辉县、武安等县的做法是：一般的采取活存、不拘时间，零存零支，不怕麻烦，保证信用，群众甚为欢迎。壶关黄山村信用社，在今夏节约备荒中，即适应群众要求，重新规定了存粮存花的办法。原则是存什取什，但利息提高了，存花每斤月息半两，期限三月，存粮每百斤月息六斤半，亦限三个月，群众也很满意。
