    Jinnan Military Region Orders Subordinates
    Investigate Class and Ideology
    [This newspaper's Jinnan dispatch, 23rd] The military region has issued a training order to its subordinates, calling for investigations into class and ideology, and participation in land reform. The instructions are summarized as follows: 1. From cadres to soldiers, from within the Party to outside the Party, conduct a thorough inspection. Through speaking bitterness, awaken class consciousness and thoroughly reflect on the landlord-rich peasant standpoint, or the petty-bourgeois all-people ideology. Do not tolerate any cadres becoming emotional or failing to do their work. 2. Conscientiously examine class background and distinguish class origins. To a small number of people who have joined the Party organizationally but not ideologically, who are Communist Party members in name but landlords and rich peasants at heart, call on them to lay down their burdens and start their engines. Resolutely purge opportunists who have sought refuge in the army, rear institutions, factories, health departments, and production departments. The instructions concluded by pointing out: in addition to ideological education, discipline must be guaranteed. It also stipulated that the entire army must assist the local masses in carrying out a reinvestigation, and no troops or individuals are allowed to obstruct the reinvestigation or interfere with transportation of supplies.

    冀南军区训令所属
    查阶级查思想
    【本报冀南二十三日电】军区训令所属，查阶级、查思想参加土改。指示略称：一、从干部到战士，从党内到党外，开展大检查，通过诉苦启发阶级觉悟，彻底反省地主富农立场，或小资产阶级的全民思想，不姑息任何干部闹情绪或不干工作。二、认真审查成份，甄别阶层出身。对少数人在组织上入党而思想上没有入党，身为共产党员心为地主富农，号召放下包袱，开动机器；对投机分子，找防空洞混入部队、后方机关、工厂、卫生部门、生产部门坚决清洗。指示最后指出：除思想上教育外，还要看纪律作保证，并规定全军必须帮助驻地群众进行复查，任何部队或个人不准阻挠复查，干涉前运。
