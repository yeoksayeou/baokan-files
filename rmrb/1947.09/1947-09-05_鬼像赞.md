The following four “Eulogies of Ghost Images” are reprinted from the “Big Park” supplement of the Shanghai Ta Kung Pao on June 2nd. The first, "King Yama," describes Chiang Kai-shek's fascist dictatorship and tyranny. The second, "Judge," vividly portrays the ugly faces of senior officials in the Chiang government, including a group of people from the Youth Party and the Democratic Socialist Party who joined the Chiang government and had longed for official positions for many years. The third, "Ox-Head and Horse-Face," refers to Chiang's henchmen, Chen Cheng, Hu Zongnan, and others. The fourth, "Little Ghosts," refers to the special agents and lackeys raised by Chiang Kai-shek, who swagger everywhere and extort money from the people at will. This poem reveals the general public's hatred and disgust for the bandit Chiang in the KMT-controlled areas. We reprint it here for our readers to enjoy. – Editor

    I. King Yama

    Occupying the Ghost Mansion of the Underworld,
    Reigning as King in Yama's Hall.
    Not minding the darkness of Hell,
    I remain high above.
    Sword trees, knife mountains, oil cauldrons,
    Skinning, bone-crushing, and disembowelment,
    All kinds of torture as commonplace,
    Resist as you may.

    II. Judge

    Learning phrases and allusions,
    Specially flattering the powerful and clinging to dragons.
    Skilled in manipulating words to help evil,
    Gaining favor from King Yama.
    With a slavish and foolish appearance,
    Actually, wearing official robes calmly,
    Acting tough by bullying the weak,
    Truly a bastard of a ghost.

    III. Ox-Head and Horse-Face

    Holding steel forks and iron rods,
    Protecting the Underworld together,
    Worthy of being called the two loyal generals of the ghost kingdom,
    Relying entirely on brute force.
    Originally beasts in human clothing,
    Calling themselves outstanding,
    But pity their unformed features,
    Inevitably marring their dignity.

    IV. Little Ghosts

    Growing this ghost face,
    No harm in scaring people everywhere.
    Often stalking single travelers at night,
    Throwing stones randomly.
    As long as you offer half a string of paper money,
    Meat, fish, and eggs as a triple sacrifice,
    I guarantee disaster will retreat and fortune will arrive,
    Everything will go smoothly.

    一、阎王
    霸住阴曹鬼府，阎罗殿内称王，不嫌地狱暗无光，我自高高在上。剑树刀山油鼎，剥皮敲骨抽肠，百般刑罚当家常，任你如何反抗。
    二、判官
    学会之乎者也，专门附凤攀龙。舞文弄墨惯帮凶，博得阎王恩宠。一脸奴才蠢相，居然袍笏从容，狐假虎威逞英雄，真是鬼儿杂种。
    三、牛头马面
    手执钢叉铁棒，双双保定幽冥，堪称鬼国二干城，全靠一身蛮劲。本是衣冠禽兽，自称头角峥嵘，但怜眉目不成形，未免有伤端正。
    四、小鬼
    长就这张鬼脸，无妨到处吓人，时时黑夜逐单身，石块乱抛一阵。只要半刀钱纸，肉鱼鸡蛋三晕，包君灾退福临门，诸事一帆风顺。
