Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, September 9th. Jiang government's Minister of Education, Zhu Jiahua, went to Peiping, Tianjin, and Shenyang in the middle and late part of last month under the guise of inspecting various schools. He deployed Party and Youth League secret agents in various places, attempting to suppress the student movement after the autumn. He was resisted by students everywhere and surrounded by students three times, resulting in extreme embarrassment. According to Tianjin newspapers, on the 22nd of last month, after Zhu inspected Northeastern University in Shenyang and was about to leave by car, students tightly closed the gate and surrounded the car, refusing to let it go. Zhu had no choice but to get out of the car and return to the president's office. Students then surrounded the president's office, shouting slogans. The student union and two representatives from each department immediately put forward requests for guaranteeing academic freedom, calculating public expenses based on the price index, improving the treatment of professors, and improving library and instrument facilities. While Zhu was surrounded by students and reluctantly answering, two cars of Chiang's police and military police suddenly drove into the school, attempting to suppress them. The students' emotions became even more激昂，insisting on an immediate response to all their demands. Zhu was forced to order the police and military police to withdraw outside the school and agreed to all the students' demands one by one, before he could escape in a flustered manner. On the 15th of last month, when Zhu was inspecting Peking University in Peiping, he was surrounded by students from Peiping Normal College, who demanded that Zhu solve the problem of the college's reconstruction in person. Zhu dared not talk to the students and slipped away through a side door under a pretext. On the 16th, he was surrounded by students at Tsinghua University again. Zhu was unable to escape and was forced to meet with the students. Because Zhu was frightened by being surrounded by students repeatedly, the banquet on the evening of the 16th was also temporarily relocated.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, September 8th. According to Peiping and Tianjin newspapers, under the dual pressure of the Jiang government's abolition of the public-funded student system and soaring prices, students in Peiping and Tianjin are enthusiastically launching a self-salvation and aid-to-study movement. The Tianjin Student Aid Committee was established in the late part of last month, with participants from 39 units of universities, middle schools, and vocational schools. Currently, they are conducting street charity sales, fundraising performances, concerts, and other fundraising activities. The aid-to-study movement in Peiping is also in full swing. When students sold aid-to-study badges, soap, and candy on the streets, citizens expressed deep sympathy and scrambled to buy them. On the 22nd of last month alone, they raised 180 million yuan in Chiang currency. The Jiang government broke its promise and abolished the public-funded student system, forcing a large number of students to drop out of school, and then妄图進而剥夺平津学生此一自救运动于后. On the 23rd of last month, the head of the Peiping municipal government even insulted the students' great self-salvation movement as "resembling beggars" and demanded that they "respect the law (!), and stop immediately." On the 28th, Chiang's Tianjin Mayor Du Jianshi also falsely accused this as "affecting social order" and demanded "the cessation of the movement." This conscienceless act of the Jiang government has aroused widespread indignation among students in Peiping and Tianjin.

　　朱家骅布置特务镇压学运
  　被平沈学生三度包围
  　平津学生展开自救助学运动
    【新华社陕北九日电】蒋政府教育部长朱家骅，上月中下旬赴平、津、沈各地，借视察各校为名，布置各地党团特务活动，企图镇压秋后的学生运动，在各地均遭到学生反抗，且三度为学生包围，窘态百出。据津报讯：上月二十二日朱氏在沈阳东北大学视察后登车正欲离去，学生紧闭大门抱围汽车不放行，朱氏无奈下车折返校长室，学生又包围校长室高呼口号，该校学生自治会及各院代表二人，当即提出保障学术自由，公费按物价指数计算，改善教授待遇，改善图书仪器设备等要求。朱氏在学生包围下俯首答复时，校外突驶来蒋家警察宪兵两车企图镇压，学生情绪更趋激昂，坚持全部要求当场答复，朱氏被迫下令警宪退出校外，并一一答允学生要求，始狼狈脱身而去。上月十五日朱氏在平视察北大时，被北平师院学生包围，要求朱氏当面解决师院复大问题。朱氏不敢与学生交谈，借词从旁门遁去。十六日在清华大学时又被学生团团围困，朱氏无法脱身，被迫与学生晤面。朱氏因迭被学生包围后胆战心惊，十六日晚宴会亦临时易地举行。
    【新华社陕北八日电】平津报讯：在蒋政府取消公费生制度与物价高涨两重压迫下，平津学生热烈展开自救的助学运动。津市学生助学委员会已于上月下旬成立，参加工作者遍及大中学暨专科学校三十九单位，目前正展开街头义卖募捐、演剧、音乐会等筹募工作。平市助学运动亦正普遍进行中，学生在街头义卖助学章、肥皂、糖果时，市民对此深表同情争相购买，仅上月二十二日一天内即募得蒋币一亿八千万元。蒋政府自食诺言取消公费生制度，迫使大量学生失学于前，复妄图进而剥夺平津学生此一自救运动于后。上月二十三日平市府负责人竟污辱学生此种伟大自救运动为“形同乞丐，”要“遵重法令（！）迅速停止。”二十八日蒋记津市长杜建时亦诬蔑此为“影响社会秩序，”要“停止该项运动”，蒋政府此种丧尽天良的行径，已在平津学生中激起普遍愤慨。
