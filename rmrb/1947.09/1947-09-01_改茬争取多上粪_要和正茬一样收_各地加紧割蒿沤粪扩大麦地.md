　　Change Crops and Strive to Apply More Manure
　　Aim for the Same Harvest as Regular Crops
　　Various Regions Hasten to Cut Artemisia and Compost Manure to Expand Wheat Fields
　　[This Newspaper Reports] In order to increase production and compensate for this autumn's poor harvest, various regions, while summarizing hoeing and seedling management, immediately arranged for accumulating manure and planting wheat to expand wheat fields, proposing that people should not fail the land, and the land should not fail the people, and that clever craftsmanship is not as good as applying more manure. They began to cut Artemisia and grass in large quantities to compost manure. In the second district of Pingshun, under the leadership of labor hero Li Shunda, everyone discussed accumulating manure and increasing production, saying, "Without fertilizer, it is impossible to increase grain production. Now you can see whose land lacks manure, and the crops are turning yellow. Look at Shunda's land; no matter which plot it is, it is dark and fertile. Shunda is right; land without fertilizer truly benefits from listening to the hero's words and doing things right." Wei Lixing, a 55-year-old man, also happily said, "Without fertilizer, it won't work. Although Artemisia hasn't grown much this year due to the drought, as long as we hurry up, it's still possible. I must complete the plan to cut 50 bundles." Then, each group and each person set out a plan. The whole village, with 41 male laborers (including semi-laborers), would cut 1,950 bundles of Artemisia. Li Shunda, Yang Laide, and others would each cut 100 bundles. In Chuandi Village, the first district, when setting a 20-day manure accumulation plan, some said: Due to the drought, the Artemisia on the slopes and riverbanks hasn't grown, so we can't cut enough. Labor hero Guo Yu'en immediately proposed that the less we can cut, the more we have to cut; the less we can do, the more we have to do. His group of 12 laborers would each cut 12 bundles of Artemisia, totaling 240 bundles. In the first ten days, they would use hoes to dig up grass and turf on both banks, and in the next ten days, they would cut Artemisia, taking time to pad mule and cattle pens, build kang soil, and scrape wall skin. After this enlightenment, everyone set out a plan, with each laborer guaranteeing to collect 400 loads of fertilizer. At the same time, the wage issue was resolved. For example, in Nansai, the second district of Pingshun, during the discussion on manure accumulation, some people complained that the Artemisia was too tender and the compost was not strong enough. Some said, "This year, the Artemisia hasn't grown due to the drought, so cutting it is not worth it. Cutting 30 to 40 catties of Artemisia a day only gets six catties of rice in wages, which is not as good as using the wages for cutting Artemisia to buy some sheep manure!" Based on these situations, it was pointed out when it was most appropriate to cut; in another 20 days, it would be time to plant wheat and harvest autumn crops, and there would be no time to cut Artemisia, so it was necessary to cut it early in a planned way, otherwise, it would inevitably be cut less. After discussion, the wage issue was reduced to four and a half catties of rice, and after unanimous agreement, a plan was set out. From the first day of the seventh lunar month to the fifteenth, all 34 full and semi-laborers in the village would cut 60,500 catties, and they would also cut Artemisia for the military and martyrs' families for one day of voluntary work. Lucheng's fourth district held a meeting on August 12th, proposing to accumulate a large amount of manure, expand wheat fields, do everything for grain, and strive to grab another handful next summer. However, the manure accumulated at home was used for topdressing. Without fertilizer, people deceive the land, and the land deceives the stomach, and grain production cannot be increased. Therefore, the masses were mobilized to make a sudden rush to cut Artemisia, scrape turf, dig high legs, build kang holes, and sweep road soil. As the saying goes: When the broom sweeps, the manure pile grows long. At the same time, in the autumn harvest, preparations were made to plant more changed crop wheat and apply more manure, striving for the same harvest as regular crops, and to inspect and eliminate wasteland, breaking the view of underestimating bad land. Whoever plants it this year will not be burdened for one year. Therefore, Zhang Huangyan cadres guaranteed not to leave a single point of wasteland. On the afternoon of the 13th of this month, 23 villages including Songcun Qiubi suffered a hailstorm, and grain production was greatly reduced. Cadres and the masses were pessimistic and disappointed. After the district called for help and neighboring villages comforted them, they immediately organized again and set out a plan: to immediately cut and compost the crops that were hit and had no harvest, and prepare to plant wheat; to pull out and replant rapeseed and mustard greens for those that were not badly hit; to support the seedlings for those that were lightly hit; and at the same time, to cut a large amount of Artemisia to accumulate manure and eliminate wasteland, preparing to plant a large amount of wheat, and to set out other production and saving remedial measures. The masses said: "Not afraid of how serious the disaster is, only afraid that the Communist Party will not mobilize." Taibei in the second district of Licheng and Qiushuyuan in the third district also specifically calculated the accounts for cutting Artemisia and accumulating manure in order to increase the wheat harvest next summer. Miao Zhen, a militia member from Nanying Village in the third district of Cixian, took the lead, cutting four large carts of grass in one day, which promoted the masses to cut more than 100 carts in one day on the second day. The mutual assistance method was that whoever cut it wanted it, and used car labor to pay back artificial labor, with great enthusiasm.

　　改茬争取多上粪
  　要和正茬一样收
  　各地加紧割蒿沤粪扩大麦地
    【本报讯】为了增加产量，补助今秋歉收，各地于总结锄苗时，紧接布置积肥种麦扩大麦田，提出人不亏地，地不亏人，巧造做不如多上粪，开始割蒿和草大量沤粪。平顺二区大地都在劳动英雄李顺达领导下，讨论积肥增产，都说：“没肥就是不能增加粮食，现在就能看出谁的地没粪，庄稼苗就发黄了，看人家顺达的地，不管那块都是黑乌乌的，顺达说的对，没肥的土地，真是听上英雄话，事情做不错。”五十五岁的老汉魏李兴也高兴的说：“没肥算不行，今年天旱蒿虽没长起，只要抓紧点还可以。我一定要完成割五十捆的计划。”接着每组每人都订出计划，全村四十一个男劳力，（半劳力在内），割蒿一千九百五十捆、李顺达、杨来德等都要割一百捆。一区川底村，在订二十天积肥计划时，有的说：天旱坡蒿岸蒿都没长起来，割不上。劳动英雄郭玉恩当即提出越割不上越得割，越搞不上越得搞、他组里十二个劳力每个割蒿十二捆，共二百四十捆，前十天用镢锄两岸草掀草坯，后十天割蒿，抽出时间多垫骡牛圈打炕土掀墙皮。经过这样启发，都订出计划，每个劳力保证搞肥四百担。同时解决了工资问题，如平顺二区南赛，在讨论积肥时有些人嫌蒿太嫩，沤粪不壮实，有的说：“今年天旱蒿没长起，割起来不上算，一天割上三四十斤蒿就得六斤工资米，还不抵用割蒿的工资卧上些羊肥哩！”根据这些情况，指出啥时割才合适，再过二十天要种麦收秋，就顾不上割蒿了，必须有计划的早割，否则非少割不可。工资问题经过讨论，降低到四斤半米，意见一致后订出计划，从阴历七月初一到十五日，全村三十四个全半劳力要割六万零五百斤，还要全体给军、烈属割一天义务蒿。潞城四区八月十二号召开会议，提出大量积肥，扩大麦田，一切为了粮食，争取明夏再抓一把。但家中积肥都上了追肥，没有肥料人哄地皮，地哄肚皮，增产不了粮食。于是发动群众突击割蒿、刮草皮、挖高脚、打炕洞、扫道土，俗语说：扫帚响，粪堆长。同时在秋收中准备多种改茬麦多上粪，争取和正茬同样收，并检查消灭荒地，打破轻视坏地观点，今年谁种上，一年不负担，故漳黄研干部保证不留一分荒地，宋村邱壁等二十三村本月十三号下午遭受雹灾，产粮大为减少，干部群众悲观失望，经过区上号召帮助，邻村安慰，即又组织起来订出办法：把打得没一点收成的庄稼立即割了沤粪，准备种麦，把打得不行的拔掉补种油菜、芥菜，轻的进行扶苗，同时大量割蒿积粪消灭荒地，准备大量种麦，并定出其他生产节约补救办法。群众都说：“不怕灾荒多严重，只怕共产党一发动。”黎城二区台北，三区秋树垣，也都为增加明夏麦收，具体算帐割蒿积肥。磁县三区南营村民兵苗珍起了带头作用，一天割草四大车，推动了群众第二天一天就割了一百余车，互助办法是谁割谁要，用车工还人工，劲头很大。
