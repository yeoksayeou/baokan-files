　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 10th: Washington dispatch: The U.S. imperialists, betraying the resolutions of the Moscow Conference and unilaterally convening a four-power conference to discuss the Korean issue, suffered a setback due to the Soviet Union's refusal. According to a statement from the U.S. State Department on the 8th, the four-power talks on the Korean issue, originally scheduled for September 8th, have been "postponed."
  　
　　Countries Restrict Imports of American Goods, U.S. Exports Continue to Plummet

　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 8th: Washington dispatch: U.S. exports experienced another alarming drop in July. According to a report released by the U.S. Department of Commerce's Bureau of Statistics on the 5th, U.S. exports in July totaled $1.15 billion, a 7% decrease from June's $1.24 billion, and a sharp 19% drop from May's $1.42 billion, the highest export month after the war. This marks the second consecutive month of decline in U.S. exports after a long period of steady post-war growth. The sharp decline in exports is mainly due to the fact that capitalist countries are reducing and restricting the import of American goods in order to conserve their depleted dollar reserves. According to a Reuter's dispatch from London on the 7th, it is estimated that the mere result of the decision by Britain, France, and Australia to cut imports of American goods will cost the United States $1 billion in business in the coming months. Other countries, such as Mexico, Brazil, Uruguay, Argentina, and Peru in South America, have successively announced the prohibition of imports of American radios and luxury goods; it is reported that Canada and Italy will also be forced to take measures to restrict the import of American goods. Secondly, the United States itself will find it difficult to continue its current export levels. U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Anderson acknowledged in his speech in New Mexico on the 5th that, due to the severe corn crop failure this year and the lack of dollars in various countries, it is impossible for U.S. agricultural products to continue last year's export levels. He also stated that "export plans must be greatly reduced." According to a TASS dispatch on the 7th, "the sharp decline in U.S. exports will have a more unfavorable impact on the already emerging crisis in the U.S. economy."
    
　　Anti-American Sentiment Among the British People is Growing Daily

　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 12th: London dispatch: Anti-American sentiment among the British people is growing daily. Progressive Labor MP Crossman and others have recently vehemently criticized the United States as "a complete imperialist country." Famous British writer Taylor forcefully stated: "American capitalism and free enterprise are the biggest enemies of democracy." He strongly criticized the authorities' reactionary policy of attempting to rely on American aid to overcome the economic crisis. The weekly "New Statesman and Nation" has repeatedly warned, demanding that Britain "not be drawn into the whirlpool of American economic turmoil." The Reynolds News believes that "it is absolutely necessary for Britain to get rid of the non-discriminatory unequal clauses advocated by the United States," and strongly advocates "concluding long-term trade agreements with those countries whose economies and British supply and demand are compatible." Even the conservative London Times has issued a warning, saying: "The United States is currently helping to expand the division of Europe by supporting reactionary anti-Soviet elements, which will cause fatal damage to Britain." According to a British Observatory poll, the percentage of British people who expressed friendliness towards Americans was about 58% in 1945, but fell to 21% last year, and the current percentage is probably even lower. For example, in London, four out of six people express unfriendliness towards the United States.

　　Contradictions Between the United States and Latin America Become More Obvious

　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 12th: Rio de Janeiro dispatch: Brazil's Mass Forum newspaper commented on the conclusion of the Pan-American Conference, saying: Although Marshall did his best, the United States gained nothing at the Pan-American Conference except for some paper effects. The newspaper pointed out that the military issues, which the United States had heavily promoted in advance, were not even included on the agenda (Note: In order to "reduce conference difficulties," the so-called Pan-American military standardization plan was not dared to be proposed). Due to various difficulties and fear of opposition from various countries, the United States had to politically abandon the idea of an "anti-communist alliance." Economically, the conference fully exposed the contradictions between the United States and Latin American countries, namely blatant imperialism on one side, and poverty and economic backwardness on the other.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 12th: Agence France-Presse, Bogota, 11th: An "anti-U.S. imperialist demonstration" took place in the capital of Colombia on the 11th. The demonstrators were students from various schools in Bogota. When the procession reached the front of the U.S. Embassy, they became agitated and overturned and damaged one car belonging to the U.S. Embassy. The demonstration was triggered by the U.S. State Department's unreasonable protest after granting the Colombian shipping company priority in exporting coffee in the ships of that country, which aroused opposition from the students and widespread dissatisfaction in Colombia. The cable also stated that Bogota's radio and newspapers declared that the Colombian people are determined to oppose the monopoly of foreign financial capital in order to defend national independence.

### 美国日趋孤立　四国共商朝鲜问题美国阴谋受挫

　　美国日趋孤立
  　四国共商朝鲜问题美国阴谋受挫
    【新华社陕北十日电】华盛顿讯：美帝国主义背弃莫斯科会议决议，擅自召开四国会议讨论朝鲜问题之阴谋企图，因苏联拒绝已遭挫折。据美国务院八日宣称：原定于九月八日举行之四强商谈朝鲜问题会议，决定予以“延期”。
  　各国限制美货入口美国输出继续猛跌
    【新华社陕北八日电】华盛顿讯，美国输出七月份又有惊人的下跌。据美商务部统计局五日报告称：美七月份出口总值为十一亿五千万元，较六月份之十二亿四千万元跌落百分之七，较战后最高出口月五月份之十四亿二千万元猛跌百分之十九。是为美国出口经战后长期稳步上升后连续下跌之第二个月。输出之锐减，主要由于资本主义各国为节约其枯竭的美元外汇减少与限制美货之入口所致。据美联社伦敦七日电估计，仅仅由于英法与澳洲三国决定削减美货入口的结果，美国今后数月中即将损失十亿元的生意。其他如南美之墨西哥、巴西、乌拉圭、阿根廷、秘鲁等国均已先后宣布禁止美国收音机及奢侈品之入口；加拿大与意大利闻亦将被迫采取限制美货入口措施。其次，美国本身亦难于继续其现在的输出水平。美农业部长安德逊五日在其新墨西哥州演说中，承认由于今年玉蜀黍的严重歉收及各国之缺乏美元，美国农产品不可能继续去年的输出水平。并称“输出计划必须大大减少”。据塔斯社七日电估计，“美国输出急剧下降，将更不利地影响危机已露端倪的美国经济”。
    英国广大人民反美情绪日增
    【新华社陕北十二日电】伦敦讯：英国广大人民的反美情绪正日益增长。英工党进步议员克罗斯曼等，近极力抨击美国“是一个十足的帝国主义国家。”英名作家泰勒力称：“美国的资本主义与自由企业，是民主的最大敌人。”他力斥当局企图依赖美国援助以克服经济危机的反动政策。“新政治家与民族”周刊一再提出警告，要求英国“不被卷入美国经济紊乱的漩涡。”雷诺新闻认为“英国有绝对必要去摆脱美国所说的不歧视的不平等条款，”力主“与那些在经济上和英国供求相应的诸国缔结长期贸易协定。”甚至保守的伦敦泰晤士报也提出警惕说：“美国目前正在以支持反动的反苏分子的方式，帮助扩大欧洲的分裂，此举将对英国造成致命的伤害。”另据英观察所民意调查，对美国人表示友善的英国人，在一九四五年约为百分之五十八，去年则跌至百分之二十一，目前的百分比当更低落。例如在伦敦，六个人中对美国表示不友善的便有四个。
  　美与拉丁美洲矛盾更加露骨
    【新华社陕北十二日电】里约热内卢讯：巴西大众论坛报评泛美会议的结束称：马歇尔虽然竭尽全力，但美国在泛美会上除了得到一些纸上效果外，结果仍是一无所得。该报指出：美国事先大事宣传的军事问题，甚至根本没有列入议事日程，（按：美国为了“减少会议困难”，所谓泛美军备标准化计划即未敢提出）。由于各种困难与害怕各国的反对，美国在政治上不得不放弃“反共同盟”的念头。在经济上，会议充分暴露出美国与拉丁美洲各国间的矛盾，即一面是露骨的帝国主义，一面是穷困和经济落后。
    【新华社陕北十二日电】法新社波哥大十一日讯：哥伦比亚京城十一日发生“反美帝国主义的示威游行。”参加示威者为哥京各校学生。队伍在行至美大使馆门前时，情绪激动，推翻与损毁美大使馆汽车各一辆。示威原因为美国务院在哥出口商予该国轮船公司装运咖啡之轮船以出口优先权后，竟提无理的抗议，此事激起了学生的反对与哥伦比亚普遍的不满。该电又称：哥京无线电与报纸均宣称：哥国人民决心反对外国财政资本的垄断，以保卫国家的独立。
