Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th. While Jiang bandit forces are depleted in the rear due to the civil war, popular uprising armed forces in Jiang bandit-controlled provinces such as Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, Sichuan, Kang, Yunnan, and Guizhou are rising up and operating. According to extremely incomplete materials revealed by Second District newspapers, the sporadic activities of the people's army since May are as follows: In the vicinity of Hujia Bridge in Fengxian County, Jiangsu, on May 29th, over 50 members of the popular uprising armed forces attacked Jiang bandit self-defense forces; in Zhangyan near Jinshan, on May 28th, a force of over 40 members of the people's army wearing grass-green uniforms and carrying new-style weapons appeared. People's armies are active in Changshu, Zhenjiang, Danyang, Wujin, Yangzhong, Jurong and other counties, and the Jiang local government is at a loss. In May, several hundred naval militiamen chased two Jiang family grain transport naval vessels in the Maqiu Mountain area of the Jiangsu sea. After the Jiang Navy Department sent warships to rescue them, the two grain ships were able to escape. The Taihu People's Army currently has more than 60 steel-plated ships, which frequently patrol the lake. After seizing more than 200 rifles from Jiang bandit Zhang Ya-liu's troops on May 14, the Siming Mountain People's Army of Zhejiang Province sent a detachment to feign an attack on Zhuangshi in Zhenhai on June 3 to contain them. Another detachment attacked the Pengwang Temple police in the county, seizing more than a dozen long and short guns and all ammunition. In addition to being active in Jixi, Taiping and other counties north and south of the Huangshan Mountains, the Anhui Southern People's Army is also active in the six counties of Wuhu and other counties in the sixth administrative region of the province, causing chaos among the Jiang bandit authorities in the region. The Jinggang Mountain People's Army on the northern foot of Jinggang Mountain on the border of Jiangxi and Hunan, the Yongxing and Lianhua areas in Jiangxi, and the Chaling and You County areas in Hunan, includes the "Monkey Team" led by Duan Zhicheng, the "Climbing Team" of Duan Yansheng and another "No Heaven Team". The first two units have a large number of people and guns and are often active in the Jiehualong area, capturing passing Jiang bandit officers and soldiers. Jiang bandits regard the area as a dangerous area. The Nanchang-Jiujiang highway in the south of the province is often threatened by the People's Army. On June 12, two buses of the Second Transportation Office of the Jiang family's Ministry of Transportation were intercepted by more than 30 members of the People's Army eight miles north of Dean, capturing Zhao Peixi, director of the Jiang-controlled Jiangxi District Direct Taxation Bureau, an official from the Transportation Office, and four escorting soldiers, seizing four guns and a large amount of supplies. The People's Army ordered the captured Jiang officials and soldiers to carry the spoils of war and triumph calmly. The Qu Bohai unit of the People's Army on the border of Sichuan, Guizhou, Hunan and Hubei is growing stronger day by day. After the Jiang army's year-long "military suppression" failed, it recently carried out so-called "political suppression," which also failed. In the border areas of Yunnan and Guizhou, popular uprisings have broken out in Zhanyi, Pingyi, Luoping, Shizong, Xuanxian and other counties in Yunnan, and Xingyi, Panxian, Shuicheng, Xianning and other counties in Guizhou, forcing the 6th Regiment of the Jiang family's Air Force Special Service Brigade stationed in the area to join forces with the county governments in May. They built bunkers along the highways and at various passes in an attempt to defend themselves. The popular uprising in Xikang is still brewing and developing. The Jiudao area from Chengdu to Ya'an is entirely threatened by the People's Army.
