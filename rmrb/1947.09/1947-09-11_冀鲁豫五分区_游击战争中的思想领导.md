　　Jiluyu Fifth Military Sub-district
  　Ideological Leadership in Guerrilla Warfare
  　(I) Clearly Uphold the Regional Thought
　　When the self-defense war began last year, everyone thought that in half a month, a month, or at most three months, our army would be able to control the Longhai Railway, and southwestern Shandong would become the central area. There was no preparation for a long-term, brutal guerrilla war. After the Dayang Lake battle, the enemy invaded north with a large force and successively occupied Dingtao, Dongming, and Heze. Especially after the Junan campaign, the Qi-Kao area (central area) was squeezed out during the enemy's mopping-up operations. The attempt to re-insert it failed, and the entire southwestern Shandong, except for a small area in eastern Dingtao, was chaotic, with many armed cadres, militia family members, piled up in the Nanhua area. On the one hand, cadres were waiting for the main force to conquer the country, and on the other hand, they regarded the occupied areas as pitch black, retreating and fleeing became the main trend at that time. The Jia Zhuang meeting of the district party committee, in response to this actual situation, analyzed the situation in the occupied areas, emphasized the favorable conditions for persisting in the region, and called on cadres and armed forces to persist in the region. Some cadres even openly stated, "Ideological work cannot be done." However, the leadership resolutely put forward, "Persisting in the region and persisting in guerrilla warfare is a revolutionary task; we must persist whether ideological work is done or not." It was also pointed out that: 1. "The problem is not whether we can persist, but whether we will persist." At the meeting, strict discipline was also announced, "Without the approval of the higher authorities, anyone who arbitrarily withdraws from the region or leaves their post will be punished." Because the leadership resolutely "persisted in the region" and severely punished those who violated discipline and retreated and fled, it blocked the back door for cadres to retreat and flee, and established a clear concept of "persisting in the region." To this day, whenever the enemy conducts mopping-up operations, the cadres in the central area put forward "Defending the territory is our responsibility" as their slogan; at the same time, the leadership divided the areas and personally took the lead in inserting into the occupied areas, persisting in the most tense environment. In this way, although the cadres' persistence was not entirely conscious, they all inserted back to persist in the struggle, thus reversing the retreat and fleeing trend. 2. Recognizing the seriousness of ideological enemies. The seriousness of cadres' ideological enemies can be clearly seen in a simple statistical material. From the beginning of the guerrilla war to the second attack on the Longhai Railway, the number of cadres in each county had decreased, but according to general statistics, 80% of the lost cadres were due to ideological wavering and escape. From this point of view, the enemy is not terrible; what is truly terrible is the ideological confusion of cadres in a severe environment. In the past, there was no investigation, no research, no prevention, no ideological struggle against this kind of ideological enemy, and fear and wavering were not opposed as enemies. This was a major shortcoming of the leadership. This is just as the Liberation Daily editorial "On the War Situation" pointed out: The enemy is not terrible; our enemy is mainly ideology: fearing the enemy, fearing difficulties, retreating and fleeing, personal calculations, small group mentality... lack of organization, disregard for discipline, etc., and pointed out: "As long as we can defeat the enemy ideologically, we will certainly be able to climb the mountains and move towards victory." This editorial made us clearly recognize the importance of ideological enemies and solving ideological problems, which greatly educated the cadres. At that time, the Propaganda Department of the District Party Committee issued a "Study the 'On the War Situation'" notice, but because of the environment, it did not play a big role except in individual counties.
    (II) Nanhua County Learning, Appraisal, and Merit-Recognition Campaign
    Before March of this year, the environment in Nanhua County was better than in other counties in the Fifth Military Sub-district, but the vast majority was still in a state of guerrilla warfare. The three districts of Pinglu, Xihe, and Dehua were often squeezed. The ideological problems of cadres were very serious. They retreated in the struggle against the enemy, made many demands in life, caused disunity, opposed the leadership, etc. The sub-committee was entangled in these trivial problems all day long, and had no confidence or way to solve the problem from the ideological and fundamental standpoints. After seeing this situation, the county party committee realized that it was not enough to fight against the enemy; it was also necessary to reorganize internally and "start the machine." They first issued a notice to study "On the War Situation" and convened a joint meeting of branch secretaries to explain the importance of studying and to arrange for the study of "On the War Situation" and to reflect on their own thoughts. However, the sub-committee's ideology was not opened up, so after receiving the instructions, some took out "On the War Situation" to read it twice, and some simply put the study notice in their pockets without even conveying it to the members of the sub-committee. The first study instruction thus failed. During the New Year, the county committee re-discussed the study issue, reviewed the reasons for the failure of the first instruction, and issued a second instruction, clarifying the three steps of the study: The first step is to study the documents, relate them to reality, and conduct discussions and reflections. The second step is for everyone to make an appraisal. The third step is to select people's meritorious heroes, and the county committee will convene a meeting of people's meritorious heroes, and convene a meeting of sub-committee secretaries to convey the information, and then print and distribute "On the War Situation," "The War Situation Begins to Change," "The Cultivation of Communist Party Members," "On Revolutionary Heroism" and other study documents, and establish merit evaluation committees at all levels. At the same time, the county government took the lead in conducting experiments and broadcasting the experience in "Nanhua Newsletter." Finally, the county party committee went to various districts to help implement the study. With resolute implementation, the study campaign was finally launched. In this study and reflection, there were great gains. First of all, ideologically, they recognized the current situation, finally broke the illusion of peace, clarified the long-term nature of guerrilla warfare, and eliminated the enemy in their minds. During the Lunar New Year, appraisals were conducted. After the armed work team members reflected, they reported their merits. Based on the reflection and merit reporting, the sub-committee made an appraisal, which was agreed upon by the individual as the final decision. After reflection and appraisal, each district, agency, brigade, and district team elected meritorious heroes. At the hero conference convened by the county party committee, they reported their merits, everyone selected meritorious heroes, reported them in the newspaper, and implemented material rewards. After the cadres studied and reflected, personal problems were reduced, internal unity was strengthened, and energy was concentrated on fighting against the enemy. They recognized the glory of meritorious role models, promoted initiative, and had a promoting effect on guerrilla warfare, anti-reckoning, and later land reform. A new atmosphere was shown among the cadres.
    (III) Dongming and Nanhua's Merit-Recognition and Thought Examination
    In March of this year, after the Yellow River returned to its old course, the enemy wanted to control the Yellow River, and first conducted continuous mopping-up operations in the Dongming and Nanhua areas, and then set up strongholds and bunkers along the river. There were a total of four brigades of enemy regular troops along the Heze-Dongming and Heze-Junan highways in Heze and Dongming cities. In addition, there were one or two thousand people in the puppet county brigades, security police teams, and local armed forces. The puppet baojia and ganshui organizations were also established in most villages. At this time, our guerrilla warfare implemented two kinds of insertions: one was the mobile cadre team composed of the Southeast Brigade leading some cadres from various districts, and the other was a small group of three or four people, inserting completely secretly. In early May, in five days of insertion, there were nine battles, and the army transferred or attacked the enemy at night. Local comrades returned to the district to understand the situation, capture and kill bad guys, and had to cope with combat during the day, which was very tiring. On the fourth day, a regiment of the enemy's main force attacked us, and the brigade divided into two groups to retreat. The brigade headquarters and local personnel "let the sheep go" (meaning scattered) and ran for more than ten miles, and encountered the returning militia at Qiaokou, and the brigade drove them away. Some cadres in Dongming scattered and fled alone. That night, two companies of the brigade and the cadre team from Dongming and Nanhua inserted outwards, and their morale was very panic-stricken. After breakfast, they arrived at the Ban Yuan embankment northeast of Dingtao and encountered the enemy's mopping-up operation again. The troops were attacked again, and the cadres "let the sheep go" again, running in two directions, and only gathered together until it was dark. The morale of some cadres was low, and they complained about the superiors. According to the situation of the cadres, in order to rectify their thoughts and improve their morale, they combined the summary of work in the cadres and launched an ideological examination centered on merit recognition. The first step was to let everyone vent their grievances and express as much opinions as possible on the leadership among the cadres. The second step was to summarize the work and review whether the insertion was a victory or a failure. The leadership always emphasized the victory aspect of the insertion and specifically compared our victories and losses during the group discussion of cadres. They clearly recognized that they fought nine battles, killed and wounded 30 rogue Ru Zibin, and effectively attacked Ru Zibin. The district department captured and killed 17 puppet Baozhang, famous fugitive landlords, and settlement leaders, which was a major blow to the enemy's pseudo-order that was being established and a great excitement to the masses, and partially stopped the enemy's intensified settlement and killing of the masses; while our total casualties were only six or seven people. It was a victory. The third step was to report good merits. The Nanhua cadre team did a better job in this matter. All the cadres expressed in public at the merit reporting meeting what they considered to be meritorious deeds in the tense and dangerous environment. They overcame the fear at the time and turned it into pride. After the cadres reported their merits, others supplemented them. After the merit evaluation committee of the cadre team evaluated the merits, the merit evaluation committee organized by the Southeast Workers' Committee unified the evaluation. There were 16 meritorious cadres and brigades in Dongming and Nanhua counties. There were four individual merits, and the number of people who received commendation for group merits was about twice as many. The fourth step was to examine the thoughts. After the merit evaluation, they further reviewed the thoughts of each person during the insertion. The cadres in Dongming did a better job in this work. Everyone reviewed their own ideological changes from the time they entered to the time they came out. The central issue was to investigate the "let the sheep go" thought. From the reflection, three typical examples can be cited: When a district chief reflected on the situation, his idea was to follow the brigade, because the brigade had combat effectiveness, and could hold the village if necessary, and then transfer at night. A section chief reflected that his idea was to be neither too far nor too close to the brigade, not in front or behind. If he was too far away, he would not be able to cope if he encountered the returning militia. If he was too close, the enemy's machine guns and artillery would target the brigade, which would be dangerous. A cadre who ran away alone and came back reflected that at that time, he estimated that the situation was serious today, and the team must collapse, so he might as well go further as soon as possible. When the enemy searched for people in the future, he would hide himself in the wheat field in the distance, and then run out at night. From these typical reflections, everyone realized that at that time, the ideas were different, the actions were inconsistent, and the superiors could hardly avoid "letting the sheep go" no matter how much they grasped. At the same time, they saw that all those who estimated that the situation was serious and slipped away alone encountered danger and suffered losses, and some only returned after a few days, throwing away their guns. Therefore, everyone realized that: cadres only care about themselves and ignore the group in an emergency. This is a personal plan, and the collective concept is weak, and they further recognized the enemy in their own thoughts. Finally, the cadre team reviewed and punished two people who freely escaped and lost their weapons. After these processes, the cadres' morale stabilized. The conference summarized the work, commended the meritorious heroes, and issued merit certificates, and everyone was in high spirits. After the meeting, the brigade soldiers said: "Chase after the enemy when you see them, and chasing them is a merit!" The cadres organized a team to insert back into the area, and at the same time, in the cadre team, they re-analyzed the situation in the eastern and southern areas and made ideological preparations for the re-insertion.

### 冀鲁豫五分区　游击战争中的思想领导

　　冀鲁豫五分区
  　游击战争中的思想领导
  　（一）明确坚持地区思想
    去年自卫战争开始，大家认为半月、一月至多三个月，我军即可控制陇海路，鲁西南就会成了中心区。对于长期的残酷的游击战争根本没有准备。大杨湖战斗以后，敌人大兵北犯，连续占领定陶、东明、荷泽，尤其是鄄南战役以后，齐考地区（中心区）于敌人扫荡时被挤了出来，复程插入又失败了，整个鲁西南除定东小块地区外，许多武装干部民兵家属，堆积在南华地区，混乱异常。干部思想一方面是等待主力打天下，一方面是把沦陷区看成一团漆黑，退却逃跑，成了当时主要倾向。地委贾庄会议，针对这种实际情况，分析了沦陷区形势，强调了坚持地区有利条件，号召干部武装坚持地区，有的干部，竟公开提出“思想打不通。”但领导上坚决提出“坚持地区坚持游击战是革命任务，通也得坚持，不通也得坚持”；又指出：一、“不是能坚持不能坚持的问题，是坚持不坚持的问题。”在大会上，又宣布了严格纪律，“没有上级批准，随便退出地区，或随便脱离工作岗位者，一律要受处分。”由于领导上“坚持地区”斗争坚决处分了不守纪律、退却逃跑分子，就堵死了干部退却逃跑的后门，树立了明确的“坚持地区”观念。直到今天，每当敌人扫荡时，中心区干部就提出“守土有责”，作为自己的行动口号；同时领导上又分开地区，亲自领头插入沦陷区，在最紧张环境下坚持。这样干部坚持虽然不是全部自觉，也就都插回去坚持了斗争，因此扭转了退却逃跑的大湾子。二、认识思想敌人的严重性。干部思想敌人的严重性，可以一个简单统计材料中明显的看出来。从游击战争开始到第二次陇海路出击，各县干部数量上都有削弱，但一般的统计，损失的干部中，百分之八十是因为思想动摇逃跑的。从此看来，敌人并不厉害，真正厉害的是在严重环境下干部的思想混乱。而过去对这种思想敌人，没调查，没研究，没防范，没有展开思想斗争，没有把恐惧动摇思想情绪当敌人一样反对，这是领导上一个大缺陷。这正如解放日报社论“论战局”所指出：敌人并不可怕，我们的敌人主要是思想，惧怕敌人，惧怕困难，退却逃跑，个人打算，小集团主义……没有组织，不守纪律等等，并且指出：“只要我们思想上能战胜敌人，我们就一定能够爬上山头，走向胜利。”这社论使我们清楚的认识了思想敌人与解决思想问题的重要性，对干部教育很大。当时地委宣传部曾发出“学习论战局”的通知，不过因为环境关系，除个别县份外，并没有起很大作用。
    （二）南华县学习，鉴定立功表模运动
    在今年三月以前，南华环境比较五分区其他县和，但绝大部分，仍是游击状态。平陆、西河、德化三个区，常常被挤压。干部思想问题很严重，在对敌斗争上退缩，生活上提出很多要求，闹不团结、反对领导等。而分委会整天被这些零碎问题缠绕不清，没信心与办法从思想上、基本立场上去解决问题。县委看到这种情况后，认识到光对敌斗争不行，还必需整理内部，必需“开动机器”。他们首先发了学习“论战局”的通知，并且召开了分书联席会，说明学习的重要，布置学习“论战局”与反省自己思想。但分委思想没有打通，所以接到指示以后，有的拿出“论战局”来读两遍，有的干脆把学习通知装了腰包连分委委员都没有传达。第一次学习指示，就这样落空了。过新年时，县委会重新讨论了学习问题，检讨了第一次指示落空的原因，发出了第二次指示，明确了学习的三个步骤：第一步是学习文件，联系实际，展开讨论，进行反省。第二步要每个人作鉴定。第三步选人民功臣，由县委召开人民功臣会议，召开分委书记会议传达，接着又印发了“论战局”“战局开始变动”“共产党员修养”“论革命英雄主义”等学习文件，成立了各级评功委员会，同时首先以县政府为首，作了试验，在“南华通讯”上广播了经验。最后县委又分别到各区帮助贯澈学习，在坚决贯澈下，学习运动终于开展了。在这次学习反省中，有很大收获。首先思想上认清了目前时局，最后打破了和平幻想，明确了游击战争的长期性，肃清了脑子里的敌人。旧历年关，进行鉴定。武工队员反省后，并进行报功，根据反省及报功，分委作出鉴定，经过个人同意，作为最后决定。经过反省鉴定，各区各机关及大队、区队都选举了功臣，在县委召开之英雄大会上，自己表功，大家选功，登报表扬，并施行物质奖励。干部学习反省以后，个人问题减少了，内部团结了，对敌斗争精力集中了。认识了功臣模范的光荣，发扬了积极性，对于游击战与反倒算及后来土改都有推动作用，干部中表现出新气象。
    （三）东明南华的立功查思想
    今年三月，黄河归故以后，敌人想控制黄河，首先对东明南华地区进行了连续扫荡，接着沿河设立据点碉堡。在荷泽东明两城荷考、荷鄄两条公路共有敌正规军四个旅番号。此外伪县大队、保警队、区地武装等一两千人。并且伪保甲及杆子会，也在大部村庄建立了。这时，我们的游击战争，是施行两种插入；一种是东南大队带领各区部分干部组成之随车干部队插入。一种是三四个人的小组，完全秘密插入。五月初插入五天，作战九次，黑夜军队转移或袭击敌人。地方同志回区了解情况，捕杀坏蛋，白天又要应付情况作战，非常疲劳。第四天敌主力一个团，对我进攻，大队分为两股撤退。大队部及地方人员“放了羊”（打散的意思）跑了十几里，到桥口又遇到还乡团，大队将其赶跑。东明部分干部，单独逃散，当夜大队两个连，与东明南华干部队向外插，情绪已甚恐慌。早饭后到达定陶东北半援堤，又遇到敌人扫荡，部队又遭袭击，干部又“放了羊”，跑成两下，直到傍黑才集合起来。部分干部情绪低落，埋怨上级。根据干部情况，为了整理思想，提高情绪，在干部中结合总结工作，开展了以立功为中心检查思想。第一步让大家发牢骚，在干部中对领导上有何意见尽量发表。第二步总结工作，检讨这次插入是胜利还是失败，领导上对这次插入，始终强调其胜利方面，在干部分组讨论时，也具体比较了我们的胜利和损失，清楚的认识到作战九次，毙伤还乡团三十余，有力的打击了鲁逆子彬。区部捕杀伪保长著名逃亡地主倒算头子十七名，对敌人正在建立的伪秩序是个大打击，对群众是个大兴奋，使敌人正在加紧的倒算杀害群众行为部分停止；而我们连伤带亡不过六、七人，这是胜利。第三步是报好立功，这件事南华干部队作的比较好，全体干部把自己在紧张危险环境里认为有功绩的事，都在报功会上当众发表。克服了当时的恐惧情绪，变为自豪。干部自报以后，旁人加以补充，经过干部队评委会评功，最后由东南工委会组织的评委会统一评，东明南华两县功臣干部与大队共十六个，个人功四个，团体功受表扬的人数约多一倍。第四步查思想，评功后进一步检讨在插入期间，各人的思想。这件工作，东明干部作的比较好，每个人检讨在插入期间，各人的思想。这件工作，东明干部作的比较好，每个人检讨自己从进去到出来中间的思想变化，中心问题是查“放羊”思想。从反省中，可以举出三个典型：一个区长反省发生情况时，他的想法是跟着大队，因大队有战斗力，必要时可坚守砦子，到晚上再转移。一个科长反省他的想法是要离大队不远不近，不前不后。远了前方碰上还乡团没法应付，近了敌人机枪炮都以大队为目标，有危险。一个跑散单独回来的干部，反省当时他估计今天情况严重，队伍一定要垮，不如趁早走远些，将来敌人搜索时，要找人的地方，自己隐蔽在远处麦地里，晚上再向外跑。从这几种典型反省中，大家认识到当时想法不同，行动不一致，上级再掌握也难免“放羊”。同时看到凡是估计情况严重单人溜的，都遇到危险，吃了亏，有的几天才回来，把枪扔了。因此大家认识到：干部一到紧急时只管个人，不顾团体，这是个人打算，集体观念薄弱，进一步认识了自己思想上的敌人。最后干部队评议对两个自由逃散丢掉武器的予以处分。经过这些过程，干部情绪稳定了，大会总结工作，表扬了功臣，发功劳证，大家情绪很高。会后大队战士说：“见了敌人就追，追上就是一功！”干部组织一个小组插回地区，同时在干部队中，又重新分析东、南地区情势，作好了再次插入的思想准备。
