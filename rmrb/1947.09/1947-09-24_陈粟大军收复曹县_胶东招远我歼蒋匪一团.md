    Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 22nd: The Chiang Kai-shek bandits invading Jiaodong suffered a severe blow from the People's Liberation Army. On the afternoon of the 18th, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits invaded Zhaoyuan in three routes. The 166th Brigade of the 8th Division of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits on the central route was intercepted by the Liberation Army in the Jituo area southwest of Zhaoyuan. After a night of fierce fighting, one regiment of the enemy was annihilated, crippling the brigade's combat effectiveness. The 103rd Brigade of the 8th Bandit Division on the northern route and a unit of the 9th Bandit Division on the southern route were also defeated at the same time. Since the 3rd of this month, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits have blindly and adventurously attacked the Jiaodong liberated areas, and have been besieged and severely attacked by the local military and civilians everywhere. Our army has successively annihilated more than 3,200 Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Pingdu City, Fenghuang Mountain, Nantoutougou in Yexian County, Lingshan, northern Jichu, and Jiedian.

At 12:00 noon that day, the entire 87th Regiment of the 52nd Brigade of the 28th Division of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Laicheng drove south with six trucks to the north of Yanzhuang. At the same time, the entire 18th Regiment of the 6th Brigade of the 75th Division of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Xintai also escorted 30 trucks transporting supplies to Yanzhuang. Our local corps immediately surrounded them and, after three hours of fierce fighting, defeated the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, capturing 120 people below the company commander level and seizing 20 trucks loaded with military supplies.
    Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 22nd: A unit of the Tancheng local armed independent regiment fought against a regiment of Chiang Kai-shek's regular army for a whole day and finally won a complete victory. On the 13th of this month, a regiment of the 80th Brigade of the 18th Division of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits set out from Lijiazhuang in Linyi and went straight to the Malingshan and Shangzhuangsi areas. Our army maneuvered to the enemy's rear, causing the enemy to find nothing. When they retreated, our army rose up to attack fiercely, fighting from dawn to dusk, killing and wounding more than 60 enemies, who fled in embarrassment. Our army pursued for more than ten miles and returned with a complete victory. All the people's property looted by the bandit army along the way was recovered and returned to the original owners. The Binhai Military Region issued a commendation order to the unit for its mobile operations of defeating the many with the few.
