The Experience of the Production Increase Campaign in Changshi Factories

    I. Democratic Management: Factory leaders must trust the masses and implement democratic management in factories. Work plans should be discussed and determined by the workers to be effective. For example, the manager of Yishengcheng reviewed last year's work and found that he subjectively set wages lower than other factories (one dou of rice), which caused eleven workers to quit. Later, he let the workers solve the problems themselves (wages, bonuses, etc.), and the workers' morale was very high. They felt that they were the owners of the factory and were very concerned about the factory's work, thus breaking the subjectivity of the leadership.

    II. Launching a Factory-Wide Mutual Teaching and Learning Movement: (1) Mutual learning between masters and apprentices. For example, Hua Qiang and Ren Tiancheng respected Yang Fulu (who had excellent skills), a new technical worker. Yang taught his skills to them, and Ren Tiancheng often told him revolutionary principles. The two gave full play to their strengths and exchanged knowledge. Cui Chunjing of the carpet department of Yishengcheng taught his apprentices, and the apprentices taught new apprentices. In the morning, they are students; in the afternoon, they are teachers. (2) Active elements help backward elements. For example, when Cui Heipang, the leader of the carpentry section of Yishengcheng, implemented the half-bonus system, Shen Baocun was afraid of losing money and not getting a bonus and wanted to earn a fixed wage. Cui Heipang talked to Lao Shen at night, saying, "As long as we work hard, we can make money, so what are we afraid of not getting a bonus? If you just want to earn a fixed wage, if the factory really loses money, won't people want to shut it down?" He straightened out Lao Shen's thinking, and Lao Shen actively started working. Heipang had a bad temper, and Lao Shen also pointed it out to him and asked him to change. Heipang was very happy to accept it.

    III. Transforming Leadership and Improving Technology: (1) Studying needs and improving technology. For example, the skilled workers in knitting and weaving towels at Yishengcheng are able to adapt to market needs, which is a major condition. If the socks aren't selling, quickly weave vests; if the cloth isn't selling, change to weaving blankets. (2) Scientifically calculating costs and implementing the two-profit policy. Yishengcheng and Hua Qiang achieved unified use of funds, overcoming the shortage of funds. Economic openness allowed workers to understand the factory's difficulties. When they were not making money, they not only did not ask for wages, but also tried their best to improve production. Hua Qiang's workers divided up five thousand yuan in two months. They were not discouraged and started researching weaving blankets on the iron loom. (3) Unified organization, mobilizing labor, division of labor leadership. Yishengcheng, Jiefangchi, and the Mass Printing Factory all did this. The entire factory has a works manager responsible for equipping and mobilizing technical personnel and specifically dividing up the daily work leadership, such as the lithography department and the letterpress department. This can give full play to the workers' persistence, avoid wasting labor, and also allow time for agricultural production. (Changshi United Office)

　　长市工厂增产运动经验
    一、民主管理工厂领导上要相信群众，实行民主管理工厂，工作计划要通过工人讨论订出，才会有效。如义合成经理，检查去年工作，因自己主观定工资比其它厂少（一斗米），有十一个工人不干了。以后他放手让工人自己解决问题（工资、分红等）后，工人情绪很高。他们感到自己是厂里的主人，非常关心厂的工作，这样打破了领导上的主观。
    二、开展全厂互教互学运动：（一）师徒互学，如华强、任天成对一个新来的技术工人杨福禄（技术很好）很尊重，杨就把自己的技术教给他，任天成又常给他讲革命道理，两人各尽所长，互相交流。义合成毯子部崔春景是他教给徒弟，徒弟再教新徒弟，晌午是学生，下午是先生。（二）积极分子帮助落后分子。如义合成木工部组长崔黑胖实行半分红制时，有个申保存怕赔钱分不上，想赚死工资，黑夜黑胖对老申谈，只要咱好好干，就能赚钱还怕分不上，赚死工资，要工厂真的赔了，人家不就要收拾吗？把老申思想打通积极起来干了，黑胖脾气不好，他也给提出来让他改，黑胖很高兴接受了。
    三、改造领导提高技术，（一）研究需要和改进技术。如义合成针织和织布织毛巾工人技术老练，能适应市场需要，就是主要条件，洋袜不快织背心，布不快就改织线毯。（二）科学计算成本，执行两利政策。义合成、华强做到了资金统一使用，克服了基金不足，经济公开使工人了解厂内困难。当不赚钱时，不但不要工资，而在生产上还尽力想法改进，华强工人两个月分了五千元，他们并不灰心，按起铁机研究织毯子。（三）统一组织调动劳力分工领导，义合成、解放池、群众印刷厂等都是这样做的，全厂有工务长，负责配备调动技术人员，日常工作具体分工领导，如石印部、铅印部等，这样能发挥工人持久，又不浪费劳力，还能抽假搞农业生产。（长市联合办公室）
