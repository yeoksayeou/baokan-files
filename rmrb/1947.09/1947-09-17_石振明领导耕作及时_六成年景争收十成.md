　　Shi Zhenming Leads Timely Cultivation
  　Striving for a Ten-Tenths Harvest in a Six-Tenths Year
    [This Dispatch from Taiyue, 15th] The United Mutual Aid Team led by Taiyue labor hero Shi Zhenming, due to timely cultivation, estimates that a ten-tenths harvest can be achieved in a year that would normally yield six-tenths. Firstly, in the spring, they plowed and planted early. Ninety-five percent of the land successfully established seedlings. During the drought in June and July, Shi Zhenming promptly proposed, "When it's dry, hoe the seedlings more to withstand water for irrigation." The entire team followed this, and the autumn seedlings were hoed three times. They also actively dug ditches, set up water lifts, and carried water for irrigation. The "Golden Queen" corn still grew to over ten feet tall, and other corn varieties were also five or six feet tall, with large, yellow ears. Although the mountain slopes suffered more severely from the drought, the average yield for both mountain and river-bottom land is estimated at six-tenths. Furthermore, by planting special crops and replanting after rain, an additional four-tenths of income was generated. For example, 67.5 mu of indigo were planted, producing over 650 jin of dye, which can be exchanged for wheat at a rate of 1.2 dou per jin, equivalent to 780 shi of fine grain. After the thorough rain, the entire team also planted 2,919 mu of buckwheat and 999 mu of vegetables, which have now been hoed twice and fertilized with diluted manure. Therefore, combining everything, a ten-tenths harvest can be achieved. Now, under the call of the old hero, the entire team is hoeing the crops again—for a total of four hoeings.

　　石振明领导耕作及时
  　六成年景争收十成
    【本报太岳十五日电】太岳劳动英雄石振明领导的联合互助大队，由于耕作及时，估计六成年景可作到十成收。首先在春天早耕早种，百分之九十五的地，都捉住了苗，六、七月间天旱时，石振明又及时提出“天旱多锄苗，顶住用水浇”。全大队照着实行，秋苗普遍锄过三遍，并且积极开渠、架秤杆、担水浇。金皇后玉茭仍长到一丈多高，其他玉茭也都是五、六尺高，谷穗又大又黄，虽然山岭坡地受旱较重。和河下地平均起来，估计可收六成，又因为种特种作物，及落过雨后进行了补种，增加了四成收入。如种蓝六十七亩五分，已打靛六百五十多斤，以每斤换麦子一斗二升计，可换细粮七百八十石。落透雨后，全大队又种荞麦二千九百一十九亩，种菜九百九十九亩，现已锄过两遍，并用稀大粪奶过，因此折合起来，可以作到十成收成。现在，又在老英雄号召之下，全大队又把庄稼锄了一遍——共锄四遍。
