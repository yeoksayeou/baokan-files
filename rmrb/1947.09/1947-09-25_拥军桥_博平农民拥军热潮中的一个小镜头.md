    Yongjun Bridge
    A Small Scene from the Bo Ping Peasants' Support-the-Army Upsurge
    Wen Li

    Chenjiapu is a village with a low-lying terrain beside the Bo-Liao Highway. After several heavy rains, the village was surrounded by large patches and pits of water. From the highway to the village, although only half a li, one had to wade through water puddles as deep as the armpits. On September 1st, just as it was getting dark, the district military station sent word that troops would be passing through the area. The farmers in the village office began to discuss it. Chen Fengsheng seemed to remember something important, and he said worriedly, "The troops coming to our village have walked hundreds of miles, their sweaty feet will be crossing cold water, I am afraid their feet will get sick."

    Someone suggested that it would be best to build a bridge. In the end, everyone felt that this matter had to be discussed with all the villagers. The broadcasting horn was used, and soon a dark crowd gathered in front of the office. Chen Fengsheng announced the proposal to build a bridge, and immediately the crowd began to buzz:

    "We have been emancipated, the troops, working hard, isn't it all for us! The comrades travel thousands of miles, how can we bear to let them wade through the water, what's the big deal about building a bridge!"

    Liu Bao'an, an activist who had been emancipated, said, "In the past, we suffered and were poor, what could we expect to be emancipated without the Eighth Route Army? I will first take out a newly distributed sapling."

    The people's enthusiasm for supporting the army was great, and the proposal to build a bridge was quickly passed. As soon as the meeting was adjourned, it became lively. Some demolished doors, some carried bricks, and the poor peasant Liu Taiheng jumped over a ten-foot-wide ditch, carried a door, and ran into the water. Liang Chuanshan ran quickly home and took out an orange tree, ... Many hands make light work, and in just half an hour, two small pontoon bridges were built. The people who built the bridge stood on the newly built Yongjun Bridge, happily and proudly talking and laughing:

    "It's very strong, it's safe for two or three thousand people to pass!"

    "The world has really changed a lot. If Chiang Kai-shek's grandson's troops come, we will definitely make them disappear."

    The night was still quiet, and the people who built the bridge had returned to the village. At the head of the Yongjun Bridge, only a farmer's association member was carrying a lantern, quietly waiting for the arrival of the People's Army. The emancipated farmers waited until midnight, and the troops really came. Dozens of farmer representatives from the whole village welcomed the soldiers like welcoming relatives. The comrades of the troops stepped on the "Yongjun Bridge" built with wooden boards by their enthusiastic efforts, and seeing the enthusiastic faces of the farmers, they were so moved that they didn't know what to say. One comrade patted Liu Shengtai on the shoulder and said:

    "You have worked hard, we are really one family!" Liu Shengtai nodded happily and said:

    "Our Eighth Route Army is risking their lives and shedding blood for the people all day long, it is nothing for us to put in a little effort, this is just to show a little bit of the heart of the whole village."

    拥军桥
    博平农民拥军热潮中的一个小镜头
    文力
    陈家铺是博聊公路旁一个地势很洼的村庄，连着几场大雨，村子周围积了成片成坑的水。从公路到村里，虽只半里路，也得淌过深到腋下的水洼。九月一日天刚黑的时候，区兵站传来了消息，部队要从这一带路过。村办公处里的几个农民，便议论起来，陈凤升象想起了一件大事，他很发愁地说：“到咱村里来，部队同志走几百里路的汗脚，一过凉水，就怕脚生毛病”。
    有人提议最好能搭个桥，最后大家觉得这事得和全村群众商量，广播筒叫过，不久办公处前边黑压压挤满了一群人。陈凤升向大家宣布了搭桥的提议，马上人群里便酝酿起来：
    “咱翻身啦，部队同志，辛辛苦苦，还不是为咱！同志们一走几千里，咱怎忍心叫人家淌水，搭桥只费点力气算啥！”
    翻身积极分子刘保安说：“过去咱受气受穷，没有八路军咱指望啥翻身，我先拿出新分的一棵小树来。”
    人们的拥军劲头很大，搭桥的提议很快的通过了。一说散会，马上便热闹起来了。有的拆门，有的搬砖，贫农刘泰恒一步跃过丈宽的水沟，扛起一扇门，就往水里跑。梁传善飞快的跑到家，拿出一条橙子来，…………。人多手快，不过半个时辰，两座小浮桥，便搭好了。修桥的人们，站在新筑的拥军桥上，高兴而自得的谈笑着：
    “挺结实的，过三几千人保险不要紧！”
    “世道真大变啦，若是老蒋的龟孙队伍来，咱准玩个小鬼不见面”。
    夜间依然是静静的，修桥的人们都回村了，在拥军桥头，只有一个农会员挑着一盏灯笼，静候着人民军队的来临。翻身农民们，一直盼到半夜时分，队伍真的来了。全村几十个农民代表，象迎亲人似的，把子弟兵迎到村里，部队的同志们踏着他们热心的用木板搭成的“拥军桥”，看到农民们一幅幅热情洋溢的面孔，感动的不知怎么好，一个同志拍着刘盛泰的肩膀说：
    “你们辛苦了，咱真是一家人！”刘盛泰高兴的点着头说：
    “咱八路军为老百姓整天拼命流血，咱费点力气，算不了啥，这只是表表全庄上的一点心意”。
