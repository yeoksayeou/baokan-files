    Zhao Village Launches Propaganda Counter-Offensive
    Inspects Village-Wide Work on Supporting the Military
    [Reported by this Newspaper] After the news of the counter-offensive reached Zhao Village in Wu'an, the entire village was stirred. Several blackboard bulletins were crowded with noisy and excited people. On the third day (September 18th), new slogans like "Our army crosses the Yangtze River, Chiang bandits have no plan," "The front launches a major counter-offensive, the rear turns itself inside out!" "Down with Chiang Kai-shek, build a new China!"... were plastered all over the walls of the village streets. A cartoon was painted on the wall at the entrance of the village, depicting the magnificent scene of the People's Liberation Army's major counter-offensive, which terrified Chiang Kai-shek on the city walls of Nanjing. Another map showed arrows pointing towards the Yangtze River basin, marking the great rivers and mountains of the motherland, which would largely fall into the hands of the People's Liberation Army. These vivid and concrete facts greatly increased the entire village's confidence in defeating Chiang Kai-shek. The shock propaganda team of the village-based organization club also conducted door-to-door propaganda. At the village-wide farmers' association meeting, a comprehensive introduction to the victorious situation was given. Consequently, all the villagers—fathers and wives—wrote letters to the front lines, encouraging their sons and husbands to bravely kill the enemy and not to return until Chiang's bandits were defeated. On the evening of September 18th, all the village cadres held a meeting to inspect the village's work on supporting the military, ensuring that this year's autumn harvest and wheat planting would be carried out better to support the brothers fighting on the southern expedition front.

    赵庄宣传大反攻
    检查全村优军工作
    【本报讯】反攻消息传到武安赵庄后，全村群众都轰动了，几处黑板报前，挤满了嘈杂兴奋的人群，第三天（十八日）“我军过长江，蒋匪无主张”，“前方大反攻，后方翻透身”！“打倒蒋介石，建设新中国”！……等崭新的标语，已爬满了全村各街的墙壁，在村口的墙壁上画着一幅漫画，人民解放军大反攻的伟大阵容，已使南京城头上的蒋介石吓得魂不附体了，而另一幅地图上的箭头，正指向长江流域。标志出祖国的大好河山，将大部入于人民解放军之手。这些生动而具体的事实，更使全村群众打倒蒋介石的胜利信心，大为提高。驻村机关俱乐部的突击宣传组，又挨户挨门进行了宣传。全村农会大会上，又作了全面胜利形势的介绍，于是全村群众们父亲们妻子们都纷纷写信寄往前线，鼓励自己的儿子丈夫，勇敢杀敌，不打倒蒋匪，不要回来。十八日晚，全村干部又举行会议，检查全村优军工作，要保证今年在秋收种麦中，更好的作好优抗工作，来支援南征前线作战的弟兄们。（驻村民运组、毛）
