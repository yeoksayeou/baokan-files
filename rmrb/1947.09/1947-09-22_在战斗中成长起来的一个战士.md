A Warrior Who Grew Up in Battle

On the second afternoon of the advance, I met Private Jia Youlin from the Third Squad, a joyful reunion after a long separation.

As the sun set, the troops marched out of the village of ××. Suddenly, from afar, someone urgently called out, "Old Wang, Old Wang, it's been quite a while since we met!"

"Ha, little Youlin!" I exclaimed in surprise and quickly went to meet him. When I shook his hand, I noticed that his right hand was injured.

Youlin's face flushed red. He seemed to have a lot to say, but at that moment, he couldn't utter a single word.

I asked him, "Kid, where did you get injured?"

"I was injured in the battle to eliminate the Second Rapid Column. It's nothing serious!"

He paused briefly and then said:

He also heard that our team was going "out to fight", in recent days he was constantly thinking that this was the time to liberate the hometown of our poor brothers (referring to liberated soldiers); unexpectedly, he grabbed my arm and said:

"Old Wang, I want to go back with you now!"

"Good comrade, your valuable spirit should be reported to higher authorities! I think it's better for you to fully recover from your injury before going back, right?"

"Good comrade, good comrade, I'll get better, even if the wound isn't healed when I go back—it'll heal on the way!"

As usual, I used an exaggerated tone to comfort him, but I didn't expect his childish temper to flare up again. He spoke even faster than picking beans. But I calmly continued:

"Good comrade, I'm no longer working in our regiment. Don't you remember seeing me visit your company the other day?"

The kid was stunned by my words and immediately let go of me weakly. At that moment, I felt a little regretful for being so blunt, causing him such great disappointment; but "spilled water is hard to recover." Helpless, I could only stall for a while and spend some time comforting him.

As we said goodbye, Youlin said affectionately, "I'm sorry, Old Wang, I can't give you a salute!"

I walked quite a distance, and the kid was still gazing at me eagerly, no, gazing at the front. His words and actions fully revealed how our glorious wounded comrades, on the eve of the great counter-offensive, were missing their troops and dedicating themselves to the complete liberation of their class brothers.

When I thought about how quickly Jia Youlin had progressed in just a few months of fighting, I couldn't help but feel delighted.

Last September, Jia Youlin was assigned to the × squad. At that time, his mood wasn't high. Joining the army just happened to coincide with a battle, which made his thoughts even more confused—he wanted to desert, but then he was afraid of not being able to find his way back.

During the ×× rectification, the superiors called for "sharpening the knives to kill the fat pigs" (referring to fighting Chiang Kai-shek's Fifth Army). Youlin understood that there would be another battle. He scratched his head and thought, "Kill the enemy, but what if the enemy kills me?!" ... After thinking it over, he still didn't dare to run away.

A few days later, sure enough, there was going to be a battle. Enemy shells rained down like a string of pearls. Youlin climbed into the trench, his heavy head never daring to lift up. The squad leader encouraged him at this time: "The enemy fires cannons at night, it's blind firing and not accurate. I've dealt with artillery before, don't be afraid!" Youlin was just about to calm down when enemy machine guns swept fiercely over. He was at a loss again. The squad leader said nonchalantly, "Comrade, don't be afraid, listen, 'swoosh, swoosh'! Those bullets are far away! Look, I'm standing here, and I'm not afraid! If the bullets go 'plop, plop,' that means they're hitting right in front of you, then you have to be careful!" Just as the squad leader finished speaking, a wave of enemies counterattacked their squad's position. Youlin threw a grenade, but it didn't explode. The squad leader asked him:

"Did you pull the pin?" He said:

"No!"

At this moment, the squad leader pulled the pins for him one by one, and Youlin threw eighteen grenades in one go. The enemy was terrified, running away with their tails between their legs. Youlin laughed and said to the comrades in the squad, "So it turns out the enemy is also afraid of death. I thought I was the only 'scaredy-cat'!"

The weather was very cold, and it was snowing. After being besieged by us for two days, the enemy began to retreat. At this time, the squad leader hit two enemies with two shots—giving Youlin an example, and designated a target for him to try a shot. Youlin had never fired a gun before. He braced himself and fired a shot. The squad leader asked him, "Are you afraid?" Youlin said, "No!" He fired another twenty rounds in a row. After the victory, he said in surprise, "So it turns out fighting is nothing. I heard before that fighting was terrible!"

Although Youlin had learned a set of combat skills, he was still terribly afraid of enemy planes. Once, the squad leader told him, "Planes aren't scary, they shoot forward. If it comes from the east, you stick close to the east wall of the communication trench; if it comes from the west, stick close to the west wall." The plane "completed its mission" and left. The squad leader found the traces of the machine gun fire and taught Youlin, "The plane's machine gun fire is deafening, but its effectiveness isn't great. Look, the bullets are still more than a zhang away," Youlin paced it out, and it was indeed accurate.

After many battles, Jia Youlin not only gradually mastered military techniques but also displayed his intelligence and wisdom; his fear gradually disappeared. I remember once, in a battle, the troops were hidden behind a house in the south end of the village, and eight enemy machine guns were blocking them. A soldier climbed onto the wall to look out. Youlin immediately stopped him, "Comrade, be careful, don't be needlessly injured; if we have fewer casualties, we'll have more strength." The soldier listened to him, and he continued, "When we charge, we must be like tigers descending the mountain; when we hide, we must be like the girls in the embroidered building!"

A little while later, the regimental commander issued an attack order. The company commander suddenly led the troops to charge from South Street. At this time, the enemy's firepower came like a storm. Youlin saw a wall on the east side of the road and immediately suggested to the company commander, "The best defense is a good offense. Quickly dig through this wall, it won't cause casualties and it will allow us to fight a good battle." The company commander listened to him, and the troops were able to safely move up from there.

When the enemy broke through, Youlin used his skilled "Type 99" rifle, "Bang, bang," firing two shots, and the enemy turned around and ran. The enemy ran fast, but Youlin chased even faster. The enemy drilled into a series of courtyards, and Youlin blocked the gate and shouted, "Hand over your guns quickly, or we'll kill you all." At this time, the enemy obediently put all the guns on the ground. Youlin captured a total of twenty-six people and seized fifteen rifles, as well as two heavy machine guns.

    在战斗中成长起来的一个战士
    进军的第二天下午，遇见了三班战士贾有林，久别重逢。心里该是多么地高兴啊。
    夕阳西沉，部队走出了××村口，忽然由远方有人紧促叫了一声：“老王，老王，可好些日子没见面啦！”
    “哈，小有林！”我惊讶了一声，飞快的迎上去，当我同他握手时，才发现他的右手负了伤。
    有林的脸涨红了，他肚里象装了许多要说的话，但这时他连一句也吐不出嘴来。
    我问他：“小鬼，你在那里负了伤”？
    “消灭第二快速纵队战斗中负的伤，不碍事”！
    他稍停了停又说：
    又听说咱们队伍要“打出去”，近日来我心肝眼儿直在想算，这正是解放我们穷兄弟（指解放战士）家乡的时候；冷不防他挽住了我的胳膊又说：
    “老王，现在我要跟你回去”！
    “好同志，你这种宝贵的精神，应该给你上报呢！我看现下你还是把伤口完全养好了回去妥当些？”
    “好同志，好同志，我就要好，彩口不到回去——在路上就好啦”！
    我照例用夸张的口气来安慰他，没想到他的小孩子脾气又犯了，他的说话比拾豆儿还快呢。但是我又平心静气说下去：
    “好同志，我已不在咱团工作了，你日前还见我到你们连里去玩吗”！
    小鬼听了我的话，顿时茫然了，随着他软溜溜地松开了我。这时我有些懊悔，不该这样生硬，使他过重的失望；但又是“复水难收”。无奈何，只好拖延了一下，费了些口舌安慰他。
    我们告辞了，有林亲切的说：“对不起，老王，我不能给你敬个礼”！
    我走了好远，小鬼还在眼巴巴地望着我，不，是望着前方。他的言语动作，充分的流露着，在大反攻的前夜，我们光荣的负伤同志，是怎样在怀念着他的部队，怎样在为了阶级弟兄的彻底解放而献身自己的一切呢。
    当我联想到，贾有林在短短的几个月战斗中，进步如此的快，我的心里不由地又欣喜起来。
    去年九月间，贾有林补充到×班，当时他的情绪就不高。刚参军恰巧遇上了战斗，因这他的思想更是混乱——想开小差，以后怕摸不着路没敢跑。
    ××整训当中，上级号召：“磨快刀，杀肥猪”（指打蒋家五军），有林明白又要打仗了，他抓耳挠脑的想“杀敌人呐，假若敌人杀死我怎办”！？………以后想来想去，还是没敢跑。
    过了几天，果然要打仗了，敌人的炮弹，连珠似的打来，有林爬上战壕里，沉甸甸的一颗头，永远抬不起来。班长这时给他壮胆：“敌人夜间打炮，是瞎打没准，我从前打过炮，不要害怕”！有林才待镇定下，敌人的机枪猛烈的扫过来，他又不知所措；班长满不在乎的说：“同志，不用怕，你听，‘嗖、嗖’！那子弹还远咧！你看我在这里立着，都不怕！如果子弹‘噗，噗’的响，那是打在眼前啦，就得当心咧”！班长刚说完这话，一股敌人向他班阵地反扑上来，有林打了一颗手榴弹没响。班长问他：
    “拉线来没有”？他说：
    “没有”！
    这时班长给他一个一个的拉线，有林便一口气投了十八个炸弹。敌人惊惶丧胆，屁滚尿流的跑了，有林笑着和班里同志说：“原来敌人也怕死，我以为光我是个‘怕死鬼’”！
    天气很冷，天下雪，敌人经我两天的围困，开始撤退。班长这时，两枪命中两个敌人——给有林来了个例子，又指定目标叫他试打一枪；有林没有打过枪，他硬撇着气打了一枪，班长问他“怕不怕”！有林说：“不怕”！接连又打了二十发子弹。战斗胜利后，他惊喜的说：“闹了半天，原来打仗没有啥，从先听说打仗可怕哩”！
    有林虽说学会了一套战斗本领，但提起敌人的飞机，还是惧怕的了不得，一次班长告诉他：“飞机并不怕，它是往前打枪的，从东来你靠交通沟的东墙；从西来，靠西墙”。飞机“完成任务”走了。班长找到机枪打过的痕迹，教导有林说“飞机机枪打的震耳，效力并不大，你看子弹距离还有一丈多远”，有林步了步，果真不差。
    经过了多次战斗，贾有林不但逐渐的能掌握了军事技术，并且发挥了他的聪明智慧；恐惧心理随着也就消逝了。记的，一次战斗，部队隐蔽在村南头一座房子后面，敌人有八挺机枪封锁着他们，一个战士爬到墙上了望，有林马上制止他：“同志小心点，不要无故伤亡；少伤亡一个，我们就多一份力量”。这个战士听从了，他又接上说：“冲锋时我们要象猛虎下山；隐蔽时，要象绣楼上的姑娘”！
    一会儿，团长下了攻击命令，连长蓦地带领部队，从南街冲杀，这时敌人的火力象暴风雨似的扑来，有林看见路东有道墙，马上建议给连长：“先下手为强，后下手遭殃，赶快挖通这道墙，一不会伤亡，二能打好仗”。连长听了他的话，部队果然安全地从这里运动上去。
    敌人突围时，有林用他熟练的“九九”式步枪，“叭，叭”的打了两响，敌人扭头就跑。敌人跑的快，有林追的更快，敌人钻进一串院里，有林就卡死大门高喊：“赶快交枪吧，不然就把你们统统打死”。这时敌人驯服的把所有的枪放在地上。有林一共俘虏了二十六名，缴获了十五枝步枪，还有两挺重机枪。
            一九四七、八、二十。
