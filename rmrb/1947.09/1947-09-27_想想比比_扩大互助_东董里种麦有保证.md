    "Think, Think, Compare, Compare" Expands Mutual Aid
    Guaranteed Wheat Planting in Dongdongli, Eastern Dong
    [Our Newspaper Reporter Team, 25th Dispatch] Guangzong’s Dongdongli Village has largely completed preparations for wheat planting and will begin sowing around the autumnal equinox. This year, the village plans to plant over 3,760 mu of wheat, approximately half of all arable land. All sun-exposed land has been plowed three times, and manure has been delivered to the fields. Currently, they are rushing to plow the wheat fields. Some mutual aid groups concentrated with poor peasants lack livestock and cannot complete the plowing of the wheat fields on their own. The entire village is implementing a large-scale labor exchange between groups to ensure that all plowing is completed before the autumnal equinox and sowing is not delayed. This year, the village is planting a quarter more wheat than last year. Furthermore, this year’s late seedlings require more effort for autumn harvesting. Therefore, the ability to manage the wheat planting preparations in an orderly manner is due to many cadres and peasants saying in unison: "We have rectified mutual aid and held 'Think, Think, Compare, Compare' meetings, which has cleared everyone's minds." Prior to the autumn harvest, the village had rectified the mutual aid groups once. At that time, the village had forty-two groups, but one hundred and fifty-six households had not yet participated in mutual aid. Among them were some households that had been struggled against and some old middle peasants, but the majority were the elderly, widowed, poor peasants, and military dependents. The reasons why these people had not yet participated were investigated separately. It was found that the elderly, widowed, and poor peasants originally wanted to participate, but they were afraid of not meeting the requirements and being embarrassed. Military dependents without labor hoped that others would cultivate the land on their behalf. If the problems of these two groups could not be resolved in a timely manner, they might not be able to plant their wheat. In order to include these people, the cadres convened a joint meeting of mutual aid group leaders, explaining that they should "open their doors wide" to the poor, widowed, elderly, and military dependents and help them plant their land, benefitting them with odd jobs and labor exchanges. At the same time, a joint meeting of non-group households was held, telling the poor, widowed, and elderly: "If you want to plant land, you must participate in mutual aid. You will definitely not encounter any obstacles if you want to participate, but you must exchange labor properly." To military dependents, they said: "In the future, preferential treatment for military families will include issuing work tickets. If you participate in mutual aid and work, the saved work ticket rice is your own." After these two meetings, the cadre group leaders took the lead in connecting and guiding both parties to meet, participate voluntarily, and welcome mutual aid. The groups quickly expanded to fifty-two. Out of the entire village of three hundred and fifty-two households, only twenty-two households that had been struggled against and thirteen households of military dependents who had not yet changed their minds did not participate. The labor force in each group was unequal, so it was decided to have a large-scale labor exchange between groups for plowing. Groups with strong oxen and sufficient livestock first rushed to plow their own land, then immediately helped groups with insufficient livestock. Each mu of wheat land in the village "strived to apply an average of one large cart of manure." Some groups were short of this amount, so they immediately launched a fertilizer production campaign, using green grass and composted manure, quickly composting two hundred and ninety large carts. On August 30th, each group held a "Think, Think, Compare, Compare" meeting, comparing this year's and last year's harvests, comparing participation and non-participation in mutual aid, comparing more hoeing and less hoeing, comparing manure application and no manure application... Through comparison, the masses clearly understood that this year's harvest was not as good as last year's, yielding only fifty to sixty percent of the harvest. To have enough to eat and use, they had to plant more wheat. Households who had joined mutual aid early calculated their accounts, noting that by participating in mutual aid, autumn crops were hoeed five or six times, and they saved labor to engage in sideline occupations, earning money to buy livestock and apply more manure. New participants recalled the difficulties they had before joining. In this way, educating and inspiring each other, both new and old households were clear that they must rely on mutual aid to plant this year's wheat well. On the 6th of this month, a production inspection team composed of more than eighty cadres from various villages in the first district arrived in Dongdongli, conducting in-depth visits to peasant households to learn about mutual aid experience, inspect wheat planting preparations, and examine conservation efforts. During informal discussions, they introduced the various production situations in their own villages, observed each other, and provided a strong impetus and stimulus to both parties. When the cadres were leaving, they said: "You are doing a very good job, let's meet at the end-of-September summary!" The cadres and masses of Dongdongli, seeing them leave, quietly encouraged each other: "We must plant the wheat well, so as not to lose face at that time." (Li Zhuang)

    “想想比比”扩大互助
    东董里种麦有保证
    【本报记者团二十五日电】广宗东董里村，种麦准备已大致就绪，秋分前后即可开耧下种。该村今年拟种麦三千七百六十余亩，约当全部耕地二分之一，所有晒地都犁过三遍，粪已送到地里，目前正赶犁麦地，有些贫农集中的互助组牲口缺乏，麦地单靠自己，无法犁完，全村即实行组与组大变工的办法，保证在秋分前全部犁好不误下种。该村今年比去年多种麦子四分之一，今年晚苗又多秋收费力，所以能够井井有条的把种麦准备工作搞好，许多干部和农民都异口同声的说：“我们整顿了互助，又开过想想比比会，大家的思想都通了。”在秋收前该村曾整顿过一次互助组，当时全村有四十二个组，尚有一百五十六户没有参加互助，其中有一部分被斗户和老中农，大部分是孤寡贫农和军属干部们，分头调查这些人尚未参加的原因，发现孤寡贫农本来都想参加，就是害怕自己不够条件闹难看，没劳力的军属则指望别人代耕，这两部分人的问题如不能及时解决，他们的麦子就有种不上的可能。为了收这些人，干部们召开互助组长联席会，说明对于贫农孤寡及军属要大开其门”，帮助他们种上地，他们以作零活变工，对自己也有好处。同时又召开了组外户联席会，向贫农孤寡说：“你们要种上地，就得参加互助，你要参加一定不会碰钉子，但是要好好给人家换工。”对军属说：“今后优军发工票，你参加互助，作了活省下工票米是自己的。”开完这两个会，干部组长即出头串通，引导双方碰头，自愿参加，欢迎互助，一下发展到五十二个。全村三百五十二户，只有二十二户被斗户及十三户还没有想开的军属群众没有参加。各组劳力不等，决定组与组犁地大变工，长牛的组及畜力够用的组，先把自己的地突击犁好，立即帮助畜力不够用的组。该村麦地每亩“争取平均上粪一大车”，有些组不足此数，马上掀起一个造肥运动，用青草及沤粪，很快沤了二百九十大车。八月三十日，各组分别召开“想想比比会”，以今年和去年的年景对比，参加互助与不参加互助对比，多锄与少锄对比，上粪与不上粪对比，……从比较当中，群众明确了今年年景不如去年，只有五、六成收，想够吃够用，必须多种麦子。早参加互助户给自己算帐，参加了互助，秋庄稼都锄了五、六遍，还省出人工搞副业，赚下钱买牲口，也就多上了粪。新参加户回忆自己未参加以前的困难。这样互相教育互相启发，新老户都明确要依靠互助，把今年的麦子种好。本月六日，一区各村干部八十多人组成的生产检查团，到达东董里，深入农家访问互助经验，检查种麦准备和节约情况；并在漫谈中，介绍自己村庄各种生产情形，相互观摩，给予双方有力的推动和刺激。那些干部们临走时说：“你们搞得很好，九月底总结时见面吧！”东董里的干部和群众，看见他们走了，悄悄的互相勉励：“一定要把麦子种好，免得那时候丢人。”（李庄）
