　　Defend the Yellow River from Breaching
  　Yellow River Commission Calls for Creating New Methods
    [Our Correspondent in Hebei-Shandong-Henan, 11th] The Yellow River Commission, after studying the experiences of various counties in guarding the dikes and plugging leaks during the first major flood, issued instructions calling on county repair and defense sections to accept these experiences and continue to create new methods in order to accomplish the glorious task of "guaranteeing the Yellow River does not breach." The instructions pointed out: Guarding the dikes and plugging leaks must be led by cadres. Experiences must be communicated to those guarding the dikes regularly. For the masses participating in flood fighting and flood prevention on the dikes, education and mobilization work must be carried out in a timely manner, and brave squads should be established to make them the main force of emergency response. Water inspection must be constant, day and night. Do not underestimate small leaks, and have a planned and organized system to fix water inspectors to certain sections for inspection to clarify responsibilities. Leadership must absorb experience, carefully study experience, and pay attention to signs.
    [Our Correspondent in Southern Hebei, 12th] The masses of Wei County brave the rain to repair dikes, ensuring the autumn harvest for the people on both sides of the Zhang River. During the heavy rains in mid-August, the Zhang River swelled violently and became extremely dangerous. After the county government heard the news, County Chief Wang personally went to the dikes to inspect and mobilized nearly 30,000 people to repair the dikes in the rain on August 15th. The morale of the masses was very high. Everyone was soaked, carrying mud, or scooping mud from the water. Although they repeatedly slipped and fell, covered in mud, they got up and continued to work from morning to night, without a single complaint. They repaired all the dikes within the territory, ensuring a worry-free autumn harvest.

　　保卫黄河不决口
  　黄委会号召创造新办法
    【本报冀鲁豫十一日电】黄委会研究第一次大泛中，各县守堤堵漏经验，特发出指示，号召县修防段，接受经验，继续创造新办法，以完成“保证黄河不决口”的光荣任务。该指示指出：守堤堵漏必须有干部带头，对守堤的人须经常传达经验，对于参加上堤抢险防泛之群众，要及时进行教育鼓动工作，建立奋勇组，使之成为抢险的主力。查水必须经常，不分昼夜，切勿轻视小水，并有计划有组织将查水人员固定起来，分段清查，以明确责任，领导上须吸收经验、细心研究经验及注意征候。
    【本报冀南十二日电】魏县群众冒雨修堤，漳河两岸群众秋收得保障。八月中旬的几日大雨，漳河暴涨，危险万分，县上闻讯后，王县长即亲自到堤上视查，并一面动员近三万群众，于八月十五号冒雨抢修堤岸，群众情绪非常高涨，每人都“汤”着水抬泥土，或从水中捞泥，虽然屡次滑倒混身是泥，爬起来还干，从早到晚，没有一人说句怨言，将境内堤岸全部修好，秋收无虑。
