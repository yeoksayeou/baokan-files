　　Rapid Development of Chickenfoot Production
    [Report from our reporter group on the 1st] Several figures demonstrate the amazing speed at which Chickenfoot County is recovering from the wounds of war. It is expected that within two years, all aspects of productivity will exceed pre-war levels. Before the War of Resistance, the county averaged one pig per ten households. Now, it averages three pigs per ten households. The right to raise pigs, previously enjoyed exclusively by landlords and rich peasants, has been transferred to the hands of the peasants. Before the War of Resistance, the county had about 8,000 head of draught animals. By the time the Japanese surrendered, only 1,900 head remained. Over the past two years, the emancipated peasants have pooled their resources to buy animals, and now the number has reached more than 3,300. By the end of the year, it is expected to increase by at least another thousand, equivalent to more than half of the pre-war level. In the past six months, women have earned 4.26 million catties of rice through spinning and weaving, doubling the pre-war level. Before the war, leaching salt was illegal. Now, with the strong promotion of the democratic government, peasants have earned 750,000 catties of rice from it in the past six months. Due to excessive wartime damage to agricultural implements, especially carts and waterwheels, the increase has been slower, as peasants prioritize the more urgent need for draught animals. Fertilizer is about half of what it was before the war due to the reduction in livestock. However, peasants have overcome some difficulties by organizing labor for deep plowing and meticulous cultivation, resulting in an estimated agricultural income of 35.58 million catties of fine grain this year, which is equal to the harvest of a normal year before the war. The improvement of the peasants' lives can be seen in the rapid increase in the number of schools. Before the war, the county had just over thirty primary schools with over two thousand students. Now, there are ninety-nine schools, and the number of students has also tripled compared to before the war, with many being children of poor peasants. During the War of Resistance, most of Chickenfoot County was occupied by the enemy and suffered severe enemy disasters. In 1942, it suffered a flood, in 1943 a drought, and in 1944 an insect plague. The peasants suffered great loss of life, and the vitality of the society was greatly damaged. Now, not only have the enemy disasters become a thing of the past, but also various natural disasters have not caused havoc because the government has led the peasants to handle them properly. This year, Chickenfoot County used 100,000 laborers to dig rivers and repair canals, eliminating the annual floods and turning 30,000 mu of dry land into paddy fields. More than 500 wells were dug, repelling the attack of the drought. In the middle of the month, many villages discovered rapidly spreading locusts. The government led the masses day and night to fight them, quickly eliminating them and saving at least 3,000 mu of ripening autumn crops. These are all things that could never be done before the war, and were also difficult to do before the land reform. This winter, the county will launch a large-scale review campaign. Based on the effectiveness of last year's land reform, feudalism has been completely eliminated, and after the peasants have obtained better production conditions, the recovery work will be even more rapid. There is no doubt that in two years, it will exceed the pre-war production level. (Li Zhuang)

　　鸡泽生产迅速发展
    【本报记者团一日电】几个数字显示了鸡泽恢复战争创伤的惊人速度，预期两年后在生产力的一切方面，均将超过战前水平。抗战前全县平均十户喂一口猪，现在平均十户喂三口，地主与富农独享的养猪权利，已转移到农民手中。抗战前全县耕畜约八千头，日寇投降时，只剩下一千九百头，两年来翻身农民全力集资伙买，现在已达三千三百余头，至年底至少尚可增加千头，相当战前二分之一强。半年来，妇女纺织赚米四百二十六万斤，较战前增加一倍。战前淋盐是犯法的事，现经民主政府大力提倡，半年来农民依靠它赚了七十五万斤米。农具因战时毁损过多，特别是大车、水车，农民区别缓急，不如耕牛需用迫切，增添较慢。肥料因牲畜减少，较战前约缺一半，但农民以组织劳力深耕细作等方法，克服了若干困难，以致今年农业收入，估计可达细粮三千五百五十八万斤，已等于战前平常年景的收获量。农民生活的改善，可由学校飞跃增加一事显露端倪。战前全县共有小学三十余所，学生两千余人，现在则有学校九十九所，学生亦较战前增加三倍，且多为贫苦农民的子弟。鸡泽全境在抗战期间大部为敌侵据，遭受严重敌灾，四二年又遭水灾，四三年再遭旱灾，四四年复遭虫灾，农民死亡甚大，社会元气大伤，现在不但敌灾已成过去，各种天灾亦因政府领导农民处置得宜，终未酿成祸患。今年鸡泽挖河修渠，共用十万劳力，免除历年水患之外，并使三万亩旱地，变成水田。挖井五百余眼，击退旱灾的袭击。月中许多村庄发现＠蝗蔓延极速，政府昼夜领导群众扑打，迅速消灭，估计至少保住将熟秋禾三千亩，这些都是战前从来作不到，土地改革前也很难作到的。该县今冬将掀起大规模复查运动，根据去年土地改革的功效，封建彻底消灭，农民获得更好的生产条件后，恢复工作，必将更加迅速，两年后无疑会超过战前生产水平。（李庄）
