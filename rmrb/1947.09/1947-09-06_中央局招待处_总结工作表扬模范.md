　　Central Bureau Reception Office
  　Summarizes Work and Commends Models
    [Our Newspaper's Report] The Administrative Section of the Organization Department of the Central Bureau convened a general meeting of all cadres and miscellaneous personnel on August 24th to summarize the work of the Reception Office and commend model workers. First, Section Chief Liu of the Administrative Section reported on the changes in work over one year and nine months, focusing on the development process of the Central Reception Office from nothing to something, from small to large; starting in the winter of 1945 with five cadres, five miscellaneous personnel, a kitchen knife, and a bellows, it has developed to the point where it now controls over 10 million yuan in assets, has cultivated a group of cadres, and has guaranteed the food, clothing, housing, and transportation of 7,000 visiting cadres, family members, and children. The main reason for this is that Party member cadres have brought into play their creativity and initiative. When the organization was first established, the higher authorities provided supplies in kind, and there was no foundation at all. Therefore, from the beginning, it was proposed to "start a fire and repair the stove" and do it ourselves; office equipment was borrowed as much as possible, and before the New Year, an ox was bought with an 8,000 yuan loan, and the private savings of the staff were collected to form over 10,000 yuan. The things that were not eaten by the storage room were taken out to open a small cooperative, everyone worked together, the male comrades went out to engage in transportation, and three female comrades at home managed it, mainly Comrade Feng Congyu, the storekeeper. Every market day, they moved things to the street to sell. At the New Year's Eve party, it was summarized that the cooperative had been open for twenty-seven days and had earned more than 50,000 yuan. From then on, the organization laid a foundation, bought mules and carts for transportation, planted vegetable gardens, opened a lumber mill, raised pigs, ground flour, sprouted bean sprouts, and made tofu. The current assets of several million yuan were built on this spirit and foundation. In the course of the work, sixteen model workers such as Qu Shiying, Zhao Yong, and Shi Enxiang emerged. Following this, Section Chief Xiao of the Cadre Section pointed out: We must value our work, be proactive and enthusiastic, be self-disciplined and treat others kindly, and pay attention to both material and spiritual care. Comrades from various units attending the meeting spoke one after another, putting forward many valuable experiences. After everyone's discussion, it was finally unanimously agreed that the Central Reception Office's guarantee of clothing, food, housing, and transportation is not a trivial matter, but a part of the cadre's work. The flexible implementation of the system, solving material difficulties, while not neglecting spiritual comfort, the combination of the two can make cadres feel the warmth of the Party, and directly help the cadre work of the Organization Department.

　　中央局招待处
  　总结工作表扬模范
    【本报讯】中央局组织部行政科于八月二十四日，召开全科干杂人员大会，总结招待处工作，表扬模范。首由行政科刘科长报告一年零九个月的工作变迁，着重说明了中招处由无到有，由小到大的发展过程；开始于四五年冬，五个干部，五个杂务人员，一把菜刀、一个风箱，发展到现在已掌握一千万元以上的家当，培养了一批干部，保证了七千来往干部家属小孩的衣食住行。其中主要原因，是党员干部发挥了创造性积极性。机关初成立时，上级以实物供给，一点底子也没有，所以一开始即提出盘火修坑自己动手；机关用具尽量借用，过年以前，以八千元借款买了一条牛，又把工作人员的私人积蓄集起一万多元，将保管室吃不完的东西拿出来，开一小合作社，大家一齐动手，男同志出去搞运输，家里有三个女同志管理，以保管员冯从瑜同志为主，逢集搬到街上卖东西，在新年晚会上总结了一下，合作社开了二十七天，赚了五万多元。从此机关打下了底子，买下骡子、大车搞运输、种菜园、开木厂、养猪、磨面、生豆芽、作豆腐，现在的千把万元家务就是在这样精神和基础上搞起来的。工作过程中，出现了曲世英、赵涌、施恩祥等十六位模范工作者。继由干部科萧科长指出：要重视自己的工作，要主动热情，克己待人，物质照顾与精神照顾等，均应注意。与会各单位同志相继发言，提出了不少宝贵经验，经过大家座谈，最后一致认为：中招处保证衣、食、住、行不是琐碎事务，而是干部工作的一部分。机动的执行制度，解决物质困难，同时不忽略精神安慰，二者结合就能使干部感受到党的温暖，也就直接帮助了组织部的干部工作。（凌新）
