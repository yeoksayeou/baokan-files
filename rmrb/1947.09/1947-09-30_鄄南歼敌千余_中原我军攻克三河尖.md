Xinhua News Agency, East China Second Front, 18th: Late news: From the 10th to the 14th of this month, a unit of the East China People's Liberation Army, in the blocking battle at Chugai (near Wang Laohu) south of Juan (cheng) in southwestern Shandong, killed or wounded more than 1,300 Chiang Kai-shek bandits at a very small cost. On the 10th, the People's Liberation Army cut off the connection between Wang Laohu and the Fifth Army of Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Xinzhuang and Gaozhuang with lightning speed, and attacked Chiang Kai-shek's reinforcement troops along the Chugai-Tangguantun line. After four days and nights of fierce fighting, the enemy suffered heavy casualties. On the 14th, the 96th Division of the Fifth Army came to aid from afar and launched a fierce attack on Chugai, blindly bombarding the People's Liberation Army positions with more than 30 heavy artillery pieces, and using five airplanes to assist in the battle. The People's Liberation Army calmly fought back. One company of a certain battalion repelled four charges by the Chiang Kai-shek army. Zhao Yunliang, the deputy platoon leader of the seventh company of the battalion, led a squad and another group to carry out a blasting operation against a Chiang Kai-shek company in the temple courtyard northeast of Tangguantun. Within five minutes, all the enemies were blasted to death in the courtyard. In the afternoon, another company of the battalion attacked the Chiang Kai-shek army from the east and west. Amidst the explosion of hand grenades by the People's Liberation Army warriors, rows of Chiang Kai-shek soldiers fell. Within 100 meters of the front line of Chugai, hundreds of corpses were left behind. In this battle, the People's Liberation Army only sacrificed four people and wounded thirty-two. A portion of military supplies was seized.

Xinhua News Agency, East China East Front, 26th: On the 20th, a unit of the People's Liberation Army intercepted a total of five regiments from parts of the Chiang Kai-shek army's 28th Division and 83rd Division fleeing south along the Zhucheng-Juxian highway in the northeast area of Juxian County north of the Bin River. That evening, they captured Chengjiazhuang north of Zhaoxian, annihilating all the defending enemies. A total of more than 100 enemies were killed or wounded, 75 were captured alive, and six light machine guns, four submachine guns, and 47 rifles and carbines were seized.

Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains Front, 28th: Following the recovery of Gushi County, a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army captured Sanhejian, a supply depot of the Chiang Kai-shek army 120 li northeast of Gushi, on the 24th. Five hundred rounds of mountain gun shells, 1,500 rounds of mortar shells, more than 10,000 bombs, and many other assets were seized. Sanhejian is a navigation hub on the Chiang Kai-shek army's supply line from Bengbu to Shangcheng. This time it is controlled by the People's Liberation Army, which poses a great threat to the Chiang Kai-shek army in the Dabie Mountains area. The Chiang Kai-shek army in Shangcheng is now in a difficult situation.

Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains Front, 28th: When the People's Liberation Army annihilated the 29th Regiment of the New 10th Brigade of the invading Chiang Kai-shek army's 58th Division in the Zhongpu area west of Shangcheng on the 19th of this month, Wu Shaozhou, the commander of the Chiang Kai-shek army's 85th Division, led two brigades to frantically harass the Zhubeidian and Nanya Port areas 14 li southeast of Huangchuan from Guangshan on the west road in Huangchuan on the 23rd, in an attempt to reinforce the 58th Division in Shangcheng. By the 25th, the enemy's right wing broke through resistance in the Hushanzhai (10 li west of Shuanglun River) and areas west and north of it. The left wing harassed Shuanglun River (60 li southeast of Huangchuan). The People's Liberation Army immediately gave the enemy a head-on blow. By the morning of the 26th, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits had suffered heavy casualties and collapsed across the board, fleeing to Huangchuan. The People's Liberation Army is now pursuing the victory.

    鄄南歼敌千余
    中原我军攻克三河尖
    【新华社华东西二线十八日电】迟到消息：本月十日至十四日，华东解放军一部于鲁西南鄄（城）南楚垓（在王老虎附近）阻击战中，以极少代价毙伤蒋匪一千三百余名。十日解放军以迅雷之势，切断王老虎与辛庄、高庄蒋匪第五军之联系，并在楚垓、唐官屯一线打击蒋匪增援部队，激战四昼夜，予敌以惨重杀伤，十四日，第五军九十六师远道来援，复向楚垓猛攻，以三十余门重炮向解放军阵地盲目轰击，并以飞机五架助战。解放军沉着应战，某营一连击退蒋军四次冲锋。该营七连一排副赵云亮，率一班又一个组向唐官屯东北庙院中之蒋匪一个连进行爆破战，在五分钟内，将敌全部炸毙于院内。下午，该营另一连分东西两路夹击蒋军，在解放军勇士的手榴弹爆炸声中，蒋军成排倒下，楚垓阵地前沿一百米达内，即遗尸数百具。是役解放军仅牺牲四名，伤三十二名。缴获军用品一部。
    【新华社华东东线二十六日电】廿日解放军一部于滨北莒县东北地区截击沿诸城、莒县公路南窜之蒋军二十八师、八三师各一部共五个团，于当晚攻克招贤以北之程家庄，将守敌全歼灭，计毙伤敌百余名，生俘七十五名，缴轻机枪六挺，冲锋枪四挺，长短枪四十七支。
    【新华社中原前线二十八日电】继收复固始县城之后，解放军某部又于二十四日一举攻占固始东北百二十里之蒋匪军补给要点三河尖，缴获山炮弹五百发，迫击炮弹千五百发，炸弹万余发，其他资财甚多。按三河尖为蒋匪军由蚌埠到商城补给线上之航运要点，此次为解放军所控制，对大别山一带之蒋匪军威胁甚大，商城蒋匪军现已处于困境。
    【新华社中原前线二十八日电】当解放军于本月十九日在商城以西之中铺地区歼灭进犯蒋匪军五十八师新十旅之二十九团后，蒋军八十五师师长吴绍周率两个旅于二十三日由潢川光山分西路向潢川东南十四里之朱陂店、南亚港地区疯狂窜扰，企图增援商城之五十八师。至二十五日敌右翼破阻于斛山砦（双轮河西十里）及以西以北地区。左翼则窜扰双轮河（潢川东南六十里）解放军即予该路敌以迎头痛击，至二十六日晨，蒋匪遭到大量杀伤，全线溃败，纷纷向潢川逃窜，现解放军正乘胜追击中。
