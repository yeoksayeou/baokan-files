　　East China People's Liberation Army
  　Luxi Annihilation of Enemy First Division
  　Seven Enemy Brigades Encircled in Northern Shaanxi

    Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 9th (delayed dispatch): On the 8th, the East China People's Liberation Army, in the Battle of Shatuji, east of Heze, Luxi, annihilated the entire Nationalist Army's 57th Division in one fell swoop. The results are still being tallied.

    Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 12th (urgent dispatch): The Northwest People's Liberation Army has overtaken the enemy retreating in panic from the northern Shaanxi front and occupied Yongping Town, 75 kilometers northeast of Yan'an, on the morning of the 11th, cutting off the retreat of Hu Zongnan's bandit troops. After the 36th Division, one of Hu's three main forces, was annihilated north of Mizhi, the seven brigades of Hu's First Army and 29th Army on the northern front were terrified and hurriedly retreated from Suide, Qingjian, and other places towards Yan'an, building fortifications along the way to provide cover for their retreat. The People's Liberation Army, taking advantage of the victory, pursued closely, making it difficult for the enemy to move an inch. Since August 24th, they have only retreated less than 100 kilometers in fifteen days. The sudden appearance of the People's Liberation Army behind enemy lines has left the seven brigades of Hu's army in a dilemma, trapped in the Qingjian area along the Yan'an-Yulin highway, facing the fate of annihilation.

  　鲁西歼敌一师
  　陕北敌七个旅陷重围
    【新华社华东前线九日电】（迟到）华东人民解放军八日于鲁西菏泽以东之沙土集战斗中，一举歼灭蒋军整五十七师全部，战果正清查中。
    【新华社西北十二日急电】西北人民解放军大军已超过由陕北北线仓惶后退之敌，于十一日晨占领延安东北七十五公里之永坪镇，切断胡宗南匪军之归路。自胡军三大主力之一的第三十六师在米脂北被歼后，北线之胡军第一军及二十九军等部七个旅惊恐万状，忙由绥德、清涧等地向延安撤退，沿途修筑工事，轮番掩护撤退。人民解放军乘胜紧紧追击，逼得敌军寸步为难，自上月二十四日以来，十五天内仅逃退不及一百公里。此次解放军大军之突然出现于敌后，已使该部胡军七个旅进退维谷，在延（安）榆（林）公路之清涧一带陷入重围，面临覆没的厄运。
