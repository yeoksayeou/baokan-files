Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 22nd. A Central News Agency report from Nanjing on the 19th stated: Sefenni, one of the American military police perpetrators of the Nanjing Massacre, was pronounced "not guilty and released" by the "U.S. Military Tribunal" on the afternoon of the 19th. The Nanjing Massacre occurred on the evening of August 1st when our compatriots Tu Shouben and Ge Fatian were pushed into the river and drowned by military police Sefenni and Alrui at Zhonghe Bridge. After the massacre, the American imperialists, intimidated by the Chinese people's public outrage, held a so-called "court-martial." Alrui, one of the perpetrators, was sentenced to "life imprisonment" on September 2nd. The verdict was sent to Washington for review, temporarily appeasing the Chinese people's public anger, attempting to repeat the trick of Pearson's retrial and acquittal in the future. Sefenni's evidence of murder, like Alrui's, was irrefutable. The fisherman Yin Ruisheng, who witnessed the massacre and was called to testify, clearly pointed out in the U.S. military court: "Both victims were pushed down by the two men" (Central News Agency, Nanjing, August 16th). Even the superiors of the two perpetrators, Captain Bomaer, the American advisory group's military police captain, admitted: "After investigation by the U.S. military, sufficient evidence has been obtained regarding the crimes of the two U.S. servicemen" (Associated Press, Nanjing, August 3rd). The American imperialists' pronouncement of the murderer Sefenni as "not guilty" once again exposed the hideous face of American imperialism.

    南京惨案凶手美竟宣判无罪
    【新华社陕北二十二日电】据中央社南京十九日讯：南京惨案美宪兵凶手之一的赛芬尼，十九日下午已被“美军军事法庭”宣判“无罪释放。”按南京惨案系发生于八月一日晚上，我国同胞土守本、葛发田在中和桥被宪兵赛芬尼，阿尔锐两人推下河中溺毙，惨案发生后美国帝国主义者慑于中国人民公愤，举行所谓“军法审判”，凶手之一的阿尔锐已于九月二日宣判“无期徒刑”，判决结果送华盛顿复审，以暂时缓和中国人民公愤，企图将来重演皮尔逊复判无罪的把戏。赛芬尼的杀人罪证如同阿尔锐一样是确确凿凿的，目睹惨案被传作证的渔夫殷瑞生曾在美军法庭上明确指出：“二被害者均系被二人所推下”（中央社南京八月十六日电）。甚至两凶手的上司美国顾问团宪兵队长波马尔上尉亦曾承认：“美军方面经调查后，对该二美军人之罪状已获得充分之证据”（合众社南京八月三日电），美国帝国主义者宣判杀人犯赛芬尼“无罪”，又一次暴露了美国帝国主义者的狰狞面目。
