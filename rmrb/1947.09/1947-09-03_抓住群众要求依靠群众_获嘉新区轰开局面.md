　　Grasp the Masses' Demands, Rely on the Masses
　　Huojia New District Opens Up a New Situation
　　[Report from our newspaper in Huojia] After the Battle of Northern Henan, all the county's cadres marched in with great strides on July 17th, covering the vast countryside from the Yellow River in the south to Daoqing in the north, from the Mu (Luandian) Xiu (Wuwu) highway in the west to the Pinghan Railway in the east (formerly Xiu Huowu). In the past half month, more than sixty administrative villages in the county have opened up a situation of anti-traitor revenge and land reform, developing more than two thousand peasant association members, training more than three thousand six hundred poor and active elements, and more than two hundred young people have joined the militia. Three districts have established their own district cadres teams of liberated peasants. The enemy's machine guns, more than three hundred rifles, and more than five thousand rounds of ammunition were seized. Poor peasants were distributed 1,677 catties of wheat, 2,338 mu of land, more than 100 houses, as well as clothing, quilts, furniture, cloth, cotton, and other items, benefiting more than 5,000 households, laying the foundation for holding guns and dividing fields in the future. The reasons for their success are: First, they acted from the very beginning: In practice, they completely kicked away the old set of rules, boldly approving the revolutionary actions of the masses in moving the property of landlords and traitors. First, use administrative power, the cadres personally went to seal the doors, and called on the masses to move things, and immediately distribute them according to the poor farmers' request. During the distribution process, the cadres explained the victorious situation to the masses, firmly expressed their determination to help the masses stand up, and enlightened the masses that the fruits of their liberation were their own. After ideological awareness was further achieved through complaints and root tracing, everyone believed that doing so was reasonable and legal, and they would act immediately. For example, Liu Yilin, a hired worker in Wangdao Village, came to the meeting as soon as he heard that the cadres had sealed Ji Wantong's door. After being allocated houses and land, he immediately moved his family into the new house, overjoyed. Experience has proven that whoever does not understand the need to resolutely and quickly distribute the property of landlords and traitors to meet the urgent needs of the masses; whoever lags behind the demands of the masses will not be able to open up a new situation in the new district. Second, universally train hired and poor peasants to quickly and universally deepen the movement. While moving the assets of traitors, a large number of poor and hired active elements were discovered and concentrated for training, so that the movement was universally deepened. First, the cadres cordially comforted them for the oppression and suffering they had suffered during the rule of the stubborn puppets, which touched the class hatred of the masses. Then, with the guidance of the leadership, a complaint movement was formed. After training, Jiang Village immediately distributed more than 90 mu of land to 40 poor peasants, using facts to tell them: Water flows thousands of miles back to the sea, and our land has returned to our hometown. After these active elements returned to the village, they understood the class boundaries, clarified the direction, and boldly colluded to divide the fields "all in one pot," and the movement was universally launched. Third, rely on the masses to solve difficulties. This time, Huojia lacked an unprecedented number of cadres in carrying out work in the vast new district. For example, the base point in Jiang Village had only one cadre, and there was no foundation for past work. The enemy harassed the area three to five hundred times a day with constant gunfire. However, it was still able to quickly open up the situation. Jiang Village was opened up in eight days, and peasant associations and militia groups were established. This is because we firmly grasped the demands of the masses, jumped down resolutely and bravely, relied on the masses, and quickly satisfied the masses' desire to stand up. Therefore, we quickly gained a firm foothold after we arrived. The cadres in Huojia clarified this point ideologically, and as soon as they entered, they quickly dispersed, each heading to their positions, facing the masses. Few people were heard asking for cadres or weapons from above. They found everything among the masses. (Silin)

　　抓住群众要求依靠群众
  　获嘉新区轰开局面
    【本报获嘉讯】豫北战役后，全县干部于七月十七号大踏步挺进，南起黄河，北至道清，西起木（栾店）修（武）公路，东至平汉路，的广大乡村（原修获武），半个月来全县六十多个行政村已轰开反奸复仇土地改革的局面，发展了两千多名农会会员，集训贫苦积极分子三千六百余人，二百多青年参加了民兵，三个区建立起翻身农民自己的区干队。缴获敌机枪一挺，步枪三百余支，子弹五千余发。贫苦农民分麦子一千六百七十七斤，土地两千三百三十八亩，房子一百多间，及衣服被子家具布匹棉花等多件，得利群众达五千余户，打下了今后持枪分田的基础。他们获得这一成绩的原因：一、一开始就行动起来：在做法上完全踢开了旧的一套，大胆批准群众搬运地主奸霸财产的革命行动。先运用行政权力，干部亲自动手封门，号召群众搬东西，根据贫苦农民要求按穷接口立即分配。在分配过程中，干部向群众说明胜利形势，坚决表示帮助群众翻身决心，并启发群众翻身果实是自己的，思想觉悟再经过圪吵追根以后，大家认为这样做合理合法，理直气壮，就会立即行动起来。如王道村一个雇工刘已林，一听干部封了吉万通的门就赶来开会，分得房地后，他立即将全家搬进新房，欣喜若狂。经验证明：谁不懂得坚决迅速分配地主奸霸财产，满足群众迫切要求；谁就会落后于群众要求之后，那就不会打开新区的局面。二、普训雇贫农迅速普遍深入，在搬运奸霸资财同时即发现大批贫雇积极分子，集中训练，使运动普遍深入。首先由干部亲切慰问他们在顽伪统治时，所受压迫痛苦，触动群众的阶级愤恨，再加领导的诱导就形成诉苦运动。蒋村在训练后，立即分配九十多亩土地给四十户贫苦农民，用事实告诉他们：水流千里归四海，咱的地又回老家来。这些积极分子回村后，懂得了阶级界线，明确了方向大胆的串通分田“一锅煮”，运动就普遍开展起来。三、依靠群众，解决困难。获嘉这次在广大新区开展工作，干部空前缺乏。如蒋村基点只有一个干部，过去工作又无基础，敌人每天三五百出扰枪声不断，然而，仍能迅速打开局面，蒋村在八天中就轰开，并成立了农会与民兵小组，这是由于我们紧紧抓住了群众要求，坚决勇敢的跳下去，依靠群众，迅速满足群众翻身渴望的缘故，因此我们去后很快就牢稳的立住了脚。获嘉干部在思想上明确了这一点，一进去就迅速撒开，各奔阵地，面向群众，很少听到有人向上要干部要武装，他们在群众中，找到了一切。（思林）
