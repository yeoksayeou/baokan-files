    Comrades Xu Xiangqian, Bo Yibo, and Others
    Send Condolences to Xu Fanting's Family
    [This Newspaper] The close comrades-in-arms of the late Comrade Xu Fanting, Xu Xiangqian, Bo Yibo, Wang Shiying, Rong Wusheng, Lei Renmin, and others, have sent a telegram of condolence to Comrade Xu's family, stating: "Upon hearing the grievous news of Comrade Fanting's passing away on the 12th of this month, we are filled with immense sorrow and regret. Comrade Fanting devoted his life to the revolutionary struggle, overthrowing the Qing Dynasty, suppressing Yuan Shikai, opposing Yan Xishan and Chiang Kai-shek, and throughout the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War behind enemy lines and the past two years of the National Patriotic Self-Defense War, he consistently stood on the side of the people, brimming with patriotic fervor and unwavering integrity, a loyalty that is truly worthy of our admiration. Now, as our mighty army advances southward, scoring victories in the counter-offensive, and the Chiang family dynasty is on the verge of collapse and demise, to lose such a veteran revolutionary general before witnessing the joyous moment is indeed a great loss for our nation and country. We extend our deepest condolences and request that you restrain your grief."

    电唁续范亭家属
    【本报讯】此间续范亭同志生前亲密战友徐向前、薄一波、王世英、戎伍胜、雷任民等，顷电唁续同志家属称：噩耗传来，惊悉范亭同志，于本月十二日病逝，不胜哀惜，范亭同志一生为革命奋斗，推翻满清，讨伐袁世凯，反对阎锡山、蒋介石，及在敌后八年抗战与二年来民族爱国自卫战争中，始终站在人民方面，满腔热血，气节昭然，忠贞耿耿，诚堪我辈钦敬。今在我大军南下，反攻告捷，蒋家皇朝即将崩溃灭亡之时，不睹笑颜，竟失一革命老将，实为我民族国家一大损失。谨致悼唁，并请节哀。
