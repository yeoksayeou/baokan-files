Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 7th: Moscow dispatch: On the third, the second anniversary of the victory over Japan, *Pravda* published an article sternly condemning the U.S. plot to monopolize Japan, stating: The Soviet Union's participation in the war against Japan and the elimination of the shock troops of the Japanese Army—the Kwantung Army—played a decisive role in accelerating the victory of the war against Japan. Although the issue of concluding a peace treaty with Japan is becoming increasingly important, it is too early to say that peace in the Far East has been established; this responsibility should be borne by the U.S. occupation forces in Japan. The work of the U.S. military occupation authorities shows obvious signs of the influence of Washington's aggressive expansionists. The U.S. authorities are directly violating the Potsdam Declaration and are trying to turn Japan into a satellite state, making it play a supporting role in implementing U.S. expansion plans. This clearly explains why Japan is requesting to have more than 100,000 army, navy, and air force personnel. The U.S. authorities are implementing large-scale military engineering projects in Japan, especially airport engineering projects, and are demanding the establishment of strategic bases in mainland Japan and neighboring Ryukyu and Ogasawara Islands. The United States is opening up Japan's foreign trade, attempting to seize Japanese raw materials and investment markets. The United States is also stubbornly excluding other Allied countries from resolving the issue of reparations; without consulting other countries, it has arbitrarily allocated 30 percent of Japan's industrial equipment as reparations. The United States not only wants to preserve Japan's military and industrial potential but also wants to deprive other Asian countries of industrial equipment, thereby perpetuating their colonial and semi-colonial status. Under the protection of the occupation authorities, Japanese militarists who are hidden underground and disguised as "democrats" are secretly planning a comeback. The newspaper continued: On the issue of the peace treaty with Japan, the United States has also implemented the same unilateral action policy, convening an eleven-nation conference to draft a peace treaty with Japan without discussing this issue with other major powers; ignoring the interests of other major powers that once eliminated Japanese aggressors and bear the main responsibility for peace. Under pressure from the United States, Britain was forced to abandon its independent policy on the peace treaty with Japan. The newspaper concluded: For the sake of peace and security, it is necessary to thoroughly disarm Japan's militarism militarily and economically and to democratize Japan.

　　苏军对日作战具有决定意义
  　真理报斥美独占日本
    为和平安全应使日本民主化
    【新华社陕北七日电】莫斯科讯：三日为对日胜利二周年纪念日，真理报著论严斥美国独占日本之阴谋称：苏联参加对日作战与铲除了日本陆军之冲锋队——关东军，对于加速对日战争之胜利，起了决定性的作用。虽然缔结对日和约问题日趋重要，但是要说远东和平已经建立，那是太早了；这种责任应由日境美占领军担负。美军占领当局的工作，显示出华盛顿侵略扩张分子影响的显明迹象。美国当局直接违背波茨顿宣言，正在试图变日本为卫星国，使之扮演实行美国扩张计划的配角。这就清楚地说明了为什么日本要求应有十万余人的陆、海、空军。美国当局正在日本实施大规模的军事工程计划，特别是机场工程计划，并要求在日本本部与邻近的琉球与小笠原岛等地建立战略基地。美国开放日本对外贸易，企图攫取日本原料与投资市场。美国还顽固地排除其他盟国解决赔偿问题；未经与他国协商，就擅自以百分之三十的日本工业装备拨作赔偿。美国不仅要保存日本的军事与工业潜力，而且要剥夺其他亚洲国家的工业装备，从而延续它们殖民地与半殖民地状况。在占领当局庇护下，隐藏地下和伪装“民主分子”的日本军国主义分子，正在暗中筹划卷土重来。该报继称：在对日和约问题上，美国也实行了同样的片面行动政策，不与其他强国讨论这一问题，就擅自召开十一国会议草拟对日和约；忽视曾经铲除日本侵略者并对和平负有主要责任的其他强国的利益。在美国的压力下，英国被迫放弃它关于对日和约的独立方针。该报结语称：为和平与安全计，需要彻底解除日本军国主义的军事与经济武装，并使日本民主化。
