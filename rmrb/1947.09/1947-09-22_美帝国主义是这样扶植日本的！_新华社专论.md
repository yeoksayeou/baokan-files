Xinhua News Agency Special Commentary

Reportedly, on May 6th, MacArthur met with Japanese Emperor Hirohito, who expressed concern about the clause in the new constitution that abolishes war. MacArthur immediately told Hirohito that he "is willing to work for Japan's security as he works for America's security." This news shocked international observers. The head of the information section of the Japanese Foreign Ministry, who served as an interpreter during the meeting, was dismissed for leaking the information (see the August 12th issue of the Tianjin Dagong Daily). This short piece of news perfectly illustrates what American imperialism, represented by MacArthur, has been doing in Japan for over a year.

Although the Moscow Conference in December 1945 decided that Japan would be governed by the Far Eastern Commission of the Allied Powers and the Allied Council for Japan of the four major powers, American imperialism, disregarding everything, created a situation where "the occupation of Japan is handled solely by the United States." Japan has become a paradise for American imperialists. The American military government enjoys the complete obedience of the Japanese people and the huge occupation costs taken from them. From early April last year to the end of March this year, a total of 39 billion yen was used; from early April this year to the end of March next year, the budget is 27 billion yen, accounting for 20-30% of Japan's total budget.

However, MacArthur's efforts in Japan over the past year have mainly been aimed at turning Japan into a solid base for its expansion and anti-Soviet activities. MacArthur has not only fostered reactionary ruling forces and retained large-scale industrial and military bases in Japan, but has also engaged in direct military preparations.

From the beginning, MacArthur retained the reactionary Japanese regime. Since 1946, MacArthur's attitude has become increasingly blatant. As a result, the Japanese reactionary military and financial groups joyfully eliminated their doubts and felt that "MacArthur" was the same as their Emperor. Thus, they became increasingly closely linked to MacArthur, and MacArthur was able to completely "govern" the Japanese people through their government. According to Wang Yunsheng, the chief editor of the Dagong Daily, who returned from Japan in March, "The Allied Headquarters often does not use instructions when issuing orders to the Japanese government, but uses methods of conveying or indicating," which shows how smoothly it operates. This situation was true during the cabinets of Kijuro Shidehara and Shigeru Yoshida, which were organized by war criminals, and has not changed even after the recent rise of the Socialist Party's Tetsu Katayama cabinet, which was promoted by the United States as "democratizing Japan." In the words of Tatsu Morito, a right-wing theorist of the Socialist Party, the characteristic of the Socialist Party is precisely to follow the occupation policy of the Allied forces.

MacArthur also tried every means to preserve and consolidate the economic foundation of the Japanese reactionary forces. MacArthur's "reform of the land system" resulted in preserving the economic position of 730,000 of the 1.07 million landlords in Japan. The control of monopoly capital in Japanese rural areas remains undamaged. Therefore, in fact, it is intended to further accelerate the capitalization of Japanese agriculture without hindering the interests of landlord capitalists. MacArthur's "dissolution of the Zaibatsu" is, in form, merely "dissolving several monopolistic large enterprise groups, allowing them to continue to exist as individual enterprises." MacArthur has continuously transported various aid to Japan from the United States, including large amounts of food, in order to barely stabilize the Japanese government and maintain it in a situation where the Japanese economy is almost in chaos and "rice riots" are occurring.

The ultimate goal of American imperialism is to make Japan its military base. Therefore, it supports a reactionary ruling force suitable for American imperialism in politics, and colludes with Japanese financial groups in industry to preserve and develop Japan's light and heavy industries and economic power.

MacArthur, using Japan's food difficulties as an excuse, implemented a so-called policy of supporting Japanese light industry. In textiles alone, Japan was allowed to retain 4 million spindles, producing 800 million pounds of cotton yarn annually, and it is estimated that at least 500 million pounds can be exported. MacArthur also stipulated that countries purchasing industrial products from Japan must supply Japan with their important raw materials. Recently, he introduced the establishment of an agreement between Japan and Australia, with Australia importing wool worth 300 million US dollars into Japan. It is said that exporting only 50% of the textiles can exchange for 500 million US dollars. The American branch of the Pacific Association wants to launch a movement to restore Japan's production of low-priced goods for sale to various countries. At the same time, MacArthur has decided to restore Japan's international private trade starting from August 15th. The role and impact of this can be seen from the reaction of the Shanghai Shen Bao and the English-language Continental Daily News. The Shen Bao editorial stated: "The early restoration of Japan's private trade will promote the restoration of Japan's control over the Far Eastern economy and the revival of Japan's military aggression." The English-language Continental Daily News stated: "This is a dream of economic penetration into parts of its former empire that have been lost."

Regarding MacArthur's cultivation of Japan's military industry, Chinese national capitalist Li Zhuchen made a shocking revelation, namely that MacArthur demanded 1 million tons of soda ash from the Chinese government, nominally for civilian food, but in fact precisely for preserving the raw materials for Japan's alkali manufacturing industry, which produces 450,000 tons annually. Li stated: The use of the alkali manufacturing industry in heavy industry is essential for ironmaking, steelmaking, aluminum production, sawmaking, tungsten production, and gunpowder, and the demand is extremely large. In light industry, it is also indispensable for rayon, artificial wool, glass, textiles, papermaking, dyeing, refining gasoline, soap, and even monosodium glutamate. If the alkali industry can be preserved, various chemical industries can develop accordingly. In modern industry, the chemical industry is the absolute mainstream. Therefore, the prosperity of Japan's chemical industry is the future gunpowder keg.

The widely anticipated issue of Japanese reparations is a particularly sharp exposure. Regarding this issue, MacArthur has acted unilaterally from beginning to end, disregarding Soviet opposition. They have successively drafted three plans: the informal plan of American experts in March of last year, the plan of American special envoy Pauley, and the plan of Streck, a specialist sent by the American military. The Pauley plan is relatively authoritative. According to this plan, Japan's steel production can maintain a production volume of 3.5 million tons per year, and the capacity of machine tools and thermal power plants can also maintain half of the pre-war level. The textile industry will be completely retained. In terms of heavy industry, Japan will still be the only heavy industry country in the Far East. In terms of light industry, Japan will still be the only country in the Far East with dumping power. The Japanese financial groups are not only not being forced to disappear, but their position is being guaranteed. However, MacArthur also stated that the Pauley plan was too "harsh," and the "generous" Streck plan emerged in response. This plan has never been announced, and it is said to be only 30% of the amount of compensation proposed by Pauley. It is generally estimated that MacArthur will adopt a compromise solution between the two. The decisive factor in the issue of reparations is the so-called minimum level of peacetime industry to maintain economic life. Some advocate using 1941 as the standard, Japan demands using 1920 as the standard, but the result is to determine 1930-1934 as the standard. That is, according to the 1930 industrial standards, the proportion of each sector is as follows: machine industry 21%, chemical industry 19%, textile industry 18%, food industry 10%, metal industry 8%, electrical 5%, and other 19%. In addition, the demolition of factories is entirely determined by MacArthur, and no allied country is allowed to visit or investigate. It is said that they are all of relatively poor standards. In the words of the Dagong Daily editorial: "This industrial scale is military equipment," then Japan is completely preserved at a level sufficient to carry out imperialist aggressive war.

MacArthur's direct military preparations are equally active and blatant. Reporters who visited Japan in March revealed the following shocking facts: "The Yokosuka naval port has not been completely destroyed, and the Kobe base is intact. A steel factory in Kobe manufactures ships and guns for the navy, and its scale is as large as a steel city. It is not listed for compensation and demolition, and the factory also has six branches, which are probably all preserved. Japan's police are world-famous and have not been touched. A huge fishing fleet roams the sea, and there are millions of veterans in the countryside with overt and covert organizations. Once something happens, they are all armed forces." (March 27th Tianjin Dagong Daily) Many military police have infiltrated the police stations to carry out activities. Police with special high-level ruling ideology have infiltrated the Ministry of Justice. The Japanese martial spirit of Jujutsu is still publicly praised by the US military. Not long ago, the Soviet Pravda revealed that the US occupation authorities were recruiting former Japanese pilots in Hokkaido, the islands of Shikoku, Saitama, and various districts of Tokyo, and training them at airports in Buzo, Kumagaya, and Ota. Night pilots are specifically trained in Saitama. These pilots are paid as much as 10,000 yen per month, all paid by the US side. Also, Japanese police are now searching everywhere, pretending to search for war criminals, but in fact registering former Japanese military personnel. (See Tianjin Dagong Daily, May 13th) The US side has strongly denied this news. In fact, the Allied Headquarters had announced in mid-April that Northwest Airlines and Pan American Airlines were allowed to take various necessary preliminary measures in Japan to implement their plans. According to this plan, Japan's post-war domestic aviation industry will be operated by the United States, and the US is currently training Japanese ground crew and radio operators, most of whom are former Japanese Air Force personnel. (See Wenhui Daily, April 20th) Rumors are circulating in Tokyo that "Japan will newly form an army to fight alongside the United States" (See Tianjin Dagong Daily, April 19th).

Recently, Japan has become arrogant and is clamoring for joint US-Japan administration of the Ryukyu Islands, fishing rights in the Kuril Islands, Sakhalin Island, and Southern Sakhalin, special immigration rights in Taiwan, and that Japanese police should be equipped with machine guns... Japanese fascists are speeding down the road to restoration, and American imperialism will rely on such a Japan to, as the Hong Kong Wah Shang Daily said, "begin a new situation of aggression."

    美帝国主义是这样扶植日本的！
    新华社专论
    报载五月六日麦克阿瑟曾与日皇裕仁会谈，裕仁表示因新宪法有废止战争之条款而忧虑，麦克阿瑟即告裕仁，渠“愿为日本安全而努力，一如其为美国安全努力。”此项消息震动了国际视听，会谈时充翻译的日外务省情报科长乃以走漏消息被撤职（见八月十二日津大公报）。这一条短短的消息，恰好说明了美帝国主义以麦克阿瑟为代表，一年余来在日本的作为。
    虽然一九四五年十二月莫斯科会议决定日本受之一盟国的远东委员会和四强的盟国对日委员会管制，但实际上却被美帝国主义不顾一切的造成了“占领日本归美国一手包办”的局面。日本成了美帝国主义者的乐园，美国军政府享受着日本人的百般恭顺，享受着取自日本人民的庞大占领费，去年四月初到今年三月底，共用三百九十亿日元；今年四月初到明年三月底，预算二百七十亿日元，占日本总预算的百分之二、三十。
    但麦克阿瑟年余以来在日本的经营，主要的是想把日本变成其扩张和反苏的坚固基地，麦克阿瑟在日本不但扶植了反动统治势力，保留大规模的工业与军事基地，并且进行了直接的军事准备。
    麦克阿瑟自始即保留了日本的反动政权，从一九四六年以来，麦克阿瑟的态度日益露骨，于是日本的反动军阀财阀集团欢然消除了疑虑，都觉得“麦帅”和他们的天皇一样，于是他们和麦克阿瑟愈来愈结合得紧，于是麦克阿瑟得以完全通过他们的政府来“治理”日本人民。据大公报主笔王芸生三月自日本归来后说：“盟总对日本政府下指令经常是不用指令，是用转告或示意的方式”，可见其运用之得心应手。这种情形，在战争罪犯所组织的币原内阁、吉田内阁时代固然如此，就是在最近被美国宣传为“日本民主化”的社会党片山哲内阁上台以后，亦毫无改变。用社会党右派理论家森户辰雄的话来说，社会党之特点正在于遵循盟军的占领政策。
    麦克阿瑟并且想尽一切办法为日本反动势力保留和稳固其经济基础，麦克阿瑟所指令的“改革土地制”，其结果保全了占全日本一百零七万地主中七十三万的较小地主之经济地位，日本农村中独占资本的控制力依然无损，因此实际上是想在不妨碍地主资本家利益的范围内，更加速日本农业的资本主义化而已。麦克阿瑟所指令的“解散财阀”，从形式上看，也不过是“把几个独占性的大企业联合组织予以解散，使它们以个别的企业形态继续存在。”麦克阿瑟不断从美国运输各种接济给予日本，包括大量粮食，以勉强稳定日本政府，在日本经济几几陷于混乱“米骚动”时起的情况下，能够继续维持。
    美帝国主义的最后目的，是要日本成为它的军事基地，因此在政治上支持一个适合美帝国主义的反动统治势力，并在工业上与日本财阀勾结，保留和发展日本的轻重工业和经济势力。
    麦克阿瑟曾以日本粮食困难为借口，实行所谓扶植日本轻工业的政策，即纺织一项便给日本保留了四百万锭子，年产棉纱八万万磅，估计至少可以输出五万万磅。麦克阿瑟并规定凡是向日本购买工业品的国家，都要把自己的重要原料供给日本，最近曾介绍日澳成立协定，澳洲输入日本之羊毛价值三万万美金，据说纺织品只出口百分之五十，便可以换回五万万美金。而太平洋协会美分会想发起一种运动，欲使日本恢复生产低廉货物售与各国同时，麦克阿瑟已决定自八月十五日开始恢复日本的国际私人贸易，其作用与影响从上海申报和英文大陆报的反应可见。申报社论说：“提早恢复日本私人贸易，势将促成日本统治远东经济之恢复和日本军事侵略之复活”。英文大陆报称：“此乃梦想经济深入其前帝国已失之部分。”
    关于麦克阿瑟培植日本的军需工业，中国民族资本家李烛尘氏作了一个惊人的揭露，那就是麦克阿瑟向中国政府索取赚一百万吨，名为民食，实则恰为保全日本制碱工业年产四十五万吨原料之用。李氏称：制碱工业之用途在重工业方面，如炼铁、炼钢、制铝、制锯、制钨、火药均属必需，且需量极大。在轻工业方面，如人造丝、人造羊毛、玻璃、纺织、制纸、染色、精制汽油、肥皂乃至味精，亦均为不可缺之必需品。碱业能保全，即各种化学工业均能相应发展，现代工业，化学工业实占绝大主流，故日本化学工业之盛兴，即为未来之火药库。
    举世瞩目的日本赔偿问题，尤属尖锐的暴露。关于该问题，麦克阿瑟自始至今都是独断独行，不顾苏联反对，他们先后拟具了三项计划：一是去年三月美国专家们的非正式计划，二是美国特使鲍莱的计划，三是美国军部派出的专员施特莱克的计划。鲍来计划是比较有权威的，按照该计划，日本钢铁生产量可以保持年产三百五十万吨的数额，工作机械，火力发电所的能力，也能保持战前二分之一的程度，纺织工业则将全部保留。这样，在重工业方面说来，则日本仍将是远东惟一的重工业国家；从轻工业方面来看，日本也仍将为远东惟一具有倾销力的国家。对于日本财阀，不但并不促使其消灭，反而确保了他们的地位。但麦克阿瑟还表示鲍莱计划太“苛刻”，“宽大”的施特莱克计划乃应运而起，该计划始终未宣布，据传仅及鲍莱所拟赔偿额百分之三十，一般估计麦克阿瑟将采两者之间的折衷方案。在赔偿问题上起决定作用的是所谓维持平时经济生活的最低和平工业的水准问题，有人主张以一九四一年为准，日本要求以一九二○年为准，结果却决定以一九三○年——三四年为准。即依一九三○年工业标准推算，各部门所占比例如下：机器工业百分之二十一，化学工业百分之十九，纺织工业百分之十八，食品工业百分之十，金属工业百分之八，电气百分之五，其他百分之十九。加之拆迁工厂全由麦克阿瑟决定，任何盟国不许参观和调查，据说都是标准较差的。照大公报社论的话说：“这个工业规模就是军备”，那么日本是被完全保留在一个足以进行帝国主义侵略战争的水准上了。
    麦克阿瑟直接进行的军事准备，同样积极而露骨。三月间赴日参观的记者们透露了如下的令人惊骇的事实：“横须贺军港还未尽毁，神户基地完好无恙，神户一个制钢厂，给海军造船造炮，规模之大，象一座钢铁城，并未列入赔偿拆迁之列，这工厂还有六个分厂，大约也一致保留了。日本的警察是世界有名的，原封未动。庞大的渔船队，驰骋海上，还有几百万退伍军人在乡间存在着明的暗的组织，一旦有事都是武力”。（三月二十七日津大公报）许多宪兵混进了警察署活动，特高统治思想的警察，又混进了司法省，日本武士道精神的柔术，还受到美军的公开赞美。不久前，苏联真理报揭发美占领军当局在北海道、四国之群岛琦玉、东京各区招集前日本飞行员，在布佐、熊谷、太田等机场加以训练。在琦玉并专门训练夜间飞行员，此等飞行员之月薪高达一万日元，均由美方发给。又日本警察现在各处搜查，佯为搜捕战犯，实则为登记前日本军事人材。（见五月十三日天津大公报）对于这项消息，美方曾力加否认，其实盟总早在四月中旬已宣布了准许西北航空公司及泛美航空公司为实行其计划，在日本作各种必要之初步措置。根据该计划，日本之战后国内航空业，将由美国经营，且美方刻正训练日本之地勤人员，及无线电报务员，大部为前日本空军人员。（见四月二十日文汇报）在东京流传着“日本将新编军队，随同美国作战”的谣言（见四月十九日津大公报）。
    近来日本竟以有恃无恐在叫嚣什么日美共管琉球，什么斯岛页岛和南库页岛的渔权，什么台湾的特殊移民权，和什么日本警察要用机关枪装备………等，日本法西斯正在复辟的道路上飞奔，美帝国主义将借重这样的一个日本，象香港华商报所说：“开始侵略的新局面”。
