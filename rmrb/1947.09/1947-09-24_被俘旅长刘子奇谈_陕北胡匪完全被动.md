    Captured Brigade Commander Liu Ziqi Talks About
    How the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Bandits Were Completely Passive

The news that the entire 36th Division, one of the three most active main forces of Hu Zongnan's anti-communist and anti-people campaign, had been annihilated in northern Shaanxi, and that Major General Liu Ziqi, brigade commander of the 123rd Brigade, had been liberated, caused a sensation at the officers' reception center of the Liberation Army here. The strength of the Liberation Army and the decline of Hu's army became the topic of conversation among Hu's army officers. Li Jiyun, brigade commander of the 31st Brigade of the 27th Division, laughed and shouted, "Ha, I guessed it right, he really came!" Because the staff of the reception center had previously talked to them about the movements of Hu's army in northern Shaanxi, Li predicted at the time: "Hu's army will definitely be wiped out, and someone will come here." Tu Jian, deputy brigade commander of the 167th Brigade of the First Division, and Liu Jiezhen, brigade chief of staff, also agreed with this prediction. He Ganlin, acting commander of the 368th Regiment of the original Liu Ziqi unit, interjected and joked: "Now I have to return to the established organization." In addition to their excitement, they, along with Li Kun, brigade commander of the 167th Brigade, and 17 others, signed a telegram to welcome Liu Ziqi. When Liu Ziqi arrived at the reception center on September 2, everyone surrounded him and introduced how they had been treated favorably and felt spiritually happy after being liberated. He Ganlin said even louder: "I came first to prepare for the brigade commander, to find a place to live, and now that it's ready, the brigade commander has also come." Everyone asked about the war situation in northern Shaanxi, and Liu Ziqi replied: "My brigade was ordered this time to rush to support Yulin overnight. More than 500 soldiers died or deserted due to hunger, thirst, and fatigue. The livestock could not get fodder and nearly 100 died. Along the way, we slept on the mountain tops at night. During the rainy season, our clothes were thin, and there were no tarpaulins or raincoats. Soldiers either fell ill from the cold, starved, or deserted. How could such troops withstand the attacks of the Eighth Route Army!" When talking about the situation of Hu's army, Liu appeared very depressed. He said: "We in northern Shaanxi are often ordered to run around, bumping around, taking care of this place when it's urgent, and then going there when it's urgent, completely passively." At this time, someone ridiculed Hu Zongnan's clumsy command, and Liu said seriously: "It's not Hu Zongnan who commands, we are completely under the command of the Eighth Route Army." Then Liu narrated that Hu Zongnan had strictly blocked the news. Before the troops arrived in northern Shaanxi, they were only allowed to read the Central Daily News. After arriving in northern Shaanxi, they were not allowed to know anything about the situation, and they were used as puppets to fight and die. Before the annihilation of the 167th Brigade in the Battle of Panlong Town, the average soldier did not know that the 135th Brigade of the 15th Division and the 31st Brigade of the 27th Division had been wiped out. After the Battle of Panlong, it was different, because Panlong was Hu's bandit's main supply station, and not only food, ammunition, and summer clothes, but even needles and thread were lost. Soldiers were still wearing cotton clothes in the summer, walking barefoot when their shoes were broken, and could not even get needles and thread. So they inquired each other, discovered all the secrets, and learned that the 167th Brigade was annihilated in solid fortifications. From then on, the morale of Hu's army plummeted and could not be salvaged. Amidst the ridicule, someone asked about Liu's fighting spirit before he was liberated, and he replied: "I had long been prepared to be a prisoner!" Liu also ridiculed Jiang thief's suicide discipline, saying: "If anyone should commit suicide, it should be Chiang Kai-shek and Hu Zongnan. They have lost so many brigades and still haven't committed suicide, why should we bother!"

    被俘旅长刘子奇谈
    陕北胡匪完全被动
    【新华社晋绥十八日电】胡宗南反共反人民最积极的三大主力之一整三十六师在陕北被歼，一二三旅少将旅长刘子奇被解放的消息，轰动了此间解放军官招待处。解放军的强大和胡军的没落，成了胡军将校的谈话主题。二十七师三十一旅旅长李纪云笑着嚷道：“哈，我估计对了，他果然来了！”因为招待处的工作人员事先曾和他们谈过陕北胡军的动向，当时李预言：“胡军一定被消灭，某也将来此。”第一师一六七旅副旅长涂健、旅参谋长柳届春亦赞和着这个预言。原刘子奇部三六八团代团长何干林插进来打趣说：“这下我可要归还建制了。”他们在兴奋之余，配合一六七旅旅长李ｋūｎ＠①岗等十七人签名致电欢迎刘子奇。九月二日刘子奇到了招待处，大家就围上去介绍各人被解放后受优待及精神上的愉快情形。何干林更大声说：“我先来是给旅长做前站、号房子，现在准备好了，旅长也来了。”大家询问陕北战况，刘子奇答道：“我这个旅这次奉命连夜赶去增援榆林，团兵因为饥渴疲劳，死亡和逃跑了五百多人。牲口吃不上草料，倒掉近一百头。一路上夜间露宿山头，雨季里，衣服单薄，又没有牛皮帐和雨衣，士兵不是冻病、饿坏，就是逃跑，这种部队怎经得起八路军的打击呀！”谈到胡军处境时，刘显得很沮丧，他说：“我们在陕北常是奉命东奔西拉，来回乱碰，这里紧顾这里，那里紧又到那里，完全处于被动地位”。这时有人讥笑胡宗南的指挥拙劣，刘正经地说：“那里是胡宗南指挥的，我们完全是受八路军指挥了。”接着刘讲述胡宗南曾经严格封锁消息，部队没到陕北前只准看中央日报，到陕北后什么情况也不让知道，把他们当木偶似的去作战送死。在蟠龙镇战役一六七旅被歼前，一般士兵都不知道十五师一三五旅和二十七师三十一旅被消灭的消息。蟠龙之役后，可不同了，因为蟠龙是胡匪主要补给站，不但食粮、械弹、夏衣，连针线也都损失光了。士兵在夏天仍着棉衣，鞋子破了光着脚走，针线也领不到。于是互相探问，发觉了全部秘密，并且得悉一六七旅是在坚固的工事里被消灭的。从此胡军士气一落千丈，不可收拾。讥笑中有人问起刘被解放前的斗志，他应声答道：“我早就准备当俘虏啦！”刘并嘲笑蒋贼的自杀纪律说：“要自杀就该叫蒋介石、胡宗南去自杀，丢了这么多旅还不自杀做什么，我们才犯不着呢！”
