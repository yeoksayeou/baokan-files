　　A Boat
　　—A Story of the Pinglu Militia
　　Cheng Man

　　The water flow at Jianping Ferry is very narrow, and the two sides often shout to each other:
　　“Hey—we won’t attack you, and you shouldn’t attack us either. We are all common people. Those who keep fighting are sons of bitches! How many Eighth Route Armymen are there anyway?”
　　“There are plenty of Eighth Route Armymen, staying in every village. If you're common people, why are you working for the reactionaries!”
　　“………………”
　　After saying that, the "@,@” gunfire from across the Yellow River would ring out a few more times.

　　In the past, the river at Jianping Ferry was full of small fishing boats and oil skins. A boat that could carry thirty people was a rarity. Recently, the enemy on the opposite shore has been using more than a dozen carpenters, and also a forge, "ding-da, ding-da" all day long. After more than twenty days of construction, a boat has not yet been completed, and the masses are a bit alarmed. As the boat nears completion, the people within thirty li of the river are uneasy day and night. Villagers near the shore move out of their villages every night.

　　At this time, district cadres and the county government were discussing defense plans. The masses also sent representatives to the county government, saying: "The stubborn police chief of our county, Xing Huaiyi, is from our Third District. After he crossed the river, leading a police squad, he has been secretly crossing the river to rob along the riverbank. The son of Li Guangyao, a landlord with 200 mu of land in our Third District, is also in that squad, and his nephew is Xing's adjutant. This boat is a joint effort between Xing's bandits and the Shanzhou Security Regiment. This boat can hold 150 people. It's about to be finished. If they come to grab food and settle old scores, how can we bear it? Hurry up and send troops!"

　　Two days later, the rotation warfare militia returned from battle on June 15th. The hopes of the masses were all pinned on them. However, the masses considered them to be not regular troops, and seeing that majestic boat being launched, they were still worried and dared not sleep at home at night.

　　That night, the militia planned to steal it across the river. But, at dawn the next day (the 16th), the militia on the riverbank reported: "Two small boats were added to the sides of the big boat last night."

　　The morning mist dissipated, and a fiery red sun hung in the clear sky. Only then did it become clear that what looked like small boats on both sides of the big boat were not small boats, but fortifications built by the enemy on the shore. These fortifications were built by the enemy to protect the big boat when it crossed the river.

　　The militia waited for night to steal the boat, but, in the evening, the enemy dragged the boat ashore. The plan to steal the boat was shattered. Everyone discussed a new plan—to burn it. But a Molotov cocktail could not be found for the time being, and with the enemy watching, it was difficult to set fire to that solid and large boat with other things. So, it was decided to "explode" it.

　　Sailor militiamen Wang Suimeng and Hai Geng enthusiastically prepared two large iron mines and six hand grenades, ready to cross the river. On the night of the 18th, a row of militiamen took the mines and hemp ropes and sent them to the shore. In addition, five groups of covering troops were divided on both sides of the ferry to provide cover. In the pitch-black night, they were just waiting for the explosion of the iron mines.

　　Those two swimming experts, crossed the dangerous Yellow River, reached the opposite bank, felt the hull of the boat, dug open the sand under the bottom of the boat, tied the mines and hand grenades together, and put them in place. Each of them pulled a rope and jumped into the water with joy. Floating in the middle of the river, the rope tightened, and they pulled forward with all their might. Suddenly, there was a "boom," and people within a dozen miles around were awakened from their dreams. The enemy on the opposite bank, panicked, thinking that the Eighth Route Army had crossed the river with a large army, immediately raised their cannons and machine guns, blindly bombing until the sun rose over the mountains.

　　However, apart from consuming ammunition, they gained nothing, leaving them only the broken remains of the big boat. (Attached picture)

　　一只船
    ——平陆民兵故事
    程漫  作
    尖坪渡的水流很窄，两岸经常喊着话：
    “喂——我们不打你们，你们也不要打吧，咱们都是老百姓，再打的就是忘八蛋，八路军有多少哟？”
    “八路军可多哩，各村住的满满的，你们是老百姓为啥当顽固呀！”
    “………………”
    说罢，黄河对岸＠、＠的枪声又响几响。
    在尖坪渡的河上以前尽是小鱼船，油包，能载三十个人的船只，即是罕见的了。近来对岸渡口上敌人用了十多个木工，还有一付铁炉，整日里“叮哒”“叮哒”的，造了二十多天了，一只船还没有做成，群众可就有些惊慌起来了。船快造成了，离河三十里内的老百姓，日夜不安，靠近岸边的村民，每到夜晚就转移出了村子。
    这时区干部和县府商讨防守计划，群众也派代表到县府说：“咱县的顽警察局长邢怀义就是我们三区人，他过了河，带着警察队，一直在河沿岸偷渡过来抢劫，我们三区有二百亩地的老地主李光耀的儿子，也在那队伍里，还有他的侄儿是邢匪的副官，这次造船就是邢匪与陕州保安团合伙在干。这只船能容一百五十人，快造完啦，要过来抢粮、倒算，怎么得了，赶快调队伍吧！”
    过了两天，轮战队民兵于六月十五日参战回来了，群众的希望全寄托在他们的身上，然而群众认为他们不是正规大军，看见那只雄纠纠的大船下水了，仍是提心吊胆，夜晚不敢睡在家里。
    当夜民兵们计划着渡过河将它偷过来，但到次日（十六日）拂晓，河岸上的民兵来报告说：“大船的两旁昨夜增加了两只小船”。
    晨雾消散，清朗朗的天空里悬起了火红的太阳，这才侦察清了大船两旁的不是小船，而是敌人在岸上修筑了两道工事；在迷雾中看去却和小船似的，这工事是敌人准备着要掩护大船过河来才修的。
    民兵们等着天黑了偷船，但，傍晚时，敌人将船拖上岸了，偷船的计划这一下给打碎了，大家又商讨着新的计划——要烧它，但是一时找不到个燃烧弹，用别的东西，在敌人的监视下，对那只坚实而庞大的船，是很难烧起来的，于是就决定了“爆炸”。
    水手民兵王随梦与海更二人兴致勃勃地准备好了两颗大铁雷，六颗手榴弹，准备过河，在十八日的晚上，一排民兵带上雷与麻绳将他俩送至岸边，另外，在渡口两旁分了五股掩护部队掩护。在漆黑的夜里，他们只等着铁雷的爆炸了。
    那两个水上能手，横渡过天险的黄河，上到对岸，摸到船身，便挖开了船底下的沙土，将雷与手榴弹系在一起，安置妥当，每人拉了一条绳子，便欣然地跳进了水里。浮至河当中，绳子一紧，他俩猛力向前一拉，顿时“轰隆”的一声雷鸣，周围十余里的人们，都从梦中惊醒了。对岸的敌人，仓惶而起，深以为八路军大军过河了，即抬起大炮，架上机枪，盲目地直轰至太阳出山。
    然而他们除了消耗弹药以外，没有收获到什么，留给他们的只是那只大船破碎的遗体。（附图片）
