　　Organizing Scoring Within Mutual Aid Teams
  　The Creation of Burden Reduction in Beiliu Village

    [This newspaper's report from Licheng] Beiliu Village in the Second District combined wheat planting mutual aid with scoring. The village put the evaluation of production and assignment of work points into the mutual aid teams, discussing and preparing during the day while repairing wheat fields and planting wheat, and conducting evaluation and work point assignment at night. Their slogan was: "Do not delay production by even a bit, do not let the masses waste a single work day." "The affairs of the masses should be handled by the masses." This boosted everyone's morale. The results of this method trial are as follows: (1) Group evaluations are fair and reasonable because everyone in the group understands the soil color and quality of the land, ensuring a fair evaluation. (2) It neither delays production nor wastes manpower, forming a mass-based evaluation where the masses handle their own affairs. Compared to the past where 27 people, including evaluators and cadres, were involved in the work point assignment, it saves 108 work days based on a four-day period. (3) The village has many special products and scattered pits. In the past, pit inspection and evaluation required 52 work days (two days) and was still insufficient. This year, it only took half a day to summarize and announce the results, which the masses said were very accurate after seeing them, saving a total of 40 work days. (4) Mass-based scoring, communicated by the teams, allows the masses to understand the methods of converting to grain, deductions, and scoring. Everyone participates in the calculations, overcoming the past issue where the masses who lost work days did not understand the process. (Huan Qing, Wen Xiu)

　　互助组内组织评分
  　北流村整顿负担的创造
    【本报黎城讯】二区北流村结合种麦互助，进行评分。该村将评产整分放到互助组里，白天修麦地种麦，捎带酝酿，黑夜评议整分。他们口号是：“不耽误一点生产，不让群众浪费一个工。”“群众的事要群众来干”。鼓舞了大家的情绪，这一办法试行的结果，有以下几种好处：（一）分组评议公道合理，因本组人都了解地的土色与土质，一定能评议的公道。（二）既不耽误生产，又不浪费民力，形成群众的事让群众来干的群众性评议，与过去各评议员与干部共二十七人的整工对比，以四天工夫计，省工一百零八个。（三）本村特产很多，坑道分散，过去验坑评议需工五十二个（两天）还不够充足，今年只误半天，已总结公布出来，群众看后都说很对，共省工四十个。（四）群众性算分，由小组传达，群众了解折谷、扣除、算分办法，大家事大家来算，克服过去误工群众不懂做法。（浣清、文秀）
