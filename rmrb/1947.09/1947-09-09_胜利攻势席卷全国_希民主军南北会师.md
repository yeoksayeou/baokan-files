Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, September 4th: Athens dispatch: The offensive of the Greek Democratic Army has swept the nation. According to a communiqué issued by the Democratic Army on August 31st, the Democratic Army continues to actively engage in combat throughout the country. In northeastern Greece, a powerful detachment of the Democratic Army liberated the Levithianthos residential area in the Komotini region, and severed the railway trunk line between Alexandroupolis (an important port on the Turkish-Greek border) and Komotini. In the Florina region of northern Greece, the Democratic Army forces are continuing their victorious advance. In the Peloponnese (i.e., the Morea Peninsula) region of southern Greece, the Democratic Army is attacking the enemy stronghold of Tsitaina and is engaged in fierce battles in the Messinia region. In western Greece, fierce fighting continues in the Epirus mountain region.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, September 7th: Athens dispatch: The Greek Democratic Army continues to advance throughout the country. In central Greece, a unit of the Democratic Army advancing from both the north and south towards the central Pindus Mountains has occupied eight villages and joined forces. The Democratic Army seized a large amount of military equipment and weapons abandoned by the Royalist bandits and captured 50 enemy soldiers. A crack unit of 1,500 Democratic Army soldiers advancing south through Epirus also joined forces with the southern guerrillas in Achilleios on the 3rd. Near the city of Lamia, the Democratic Army captured three villages. In the Peloponnese, the Democratic Army broke through enemy resistance and occupied the village of Langadia in the Kynouria region. From August 26th to the end of August, the Democratic Army killed or wounded 1,120 enemy soldiers and captured 94 enemy soldiers.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, September 4th: Athens dispatch: In a commentary on the formation of a cabinet by Greek American favorite Tsaldaris, the Greek Democratic Army's radio broadcast said firmly and confidently, "If the last seven-party coalition failed to suppress the Greek people, then Tsaldaris alone can do even less." The broadcast pointed out, "Only by overthrowing the political rule imposed on Greece by the United States and Britain, stopping foreign interference, and forming a government with a broad mass base composed of equal democratic forces nationwide, is there a way to escape the current chaos and civil war in Greece." According to reports, within the ruling clique of the Greek petty monarchy, the recent development of the Democratic Army's offensive has plunged them into greater panic and confusion. After forming a single-party cabinet, Tsaldaris is increasingly isolated, and even royalist newspapers are calling it a "disaster government" and an "unfortunate premature infant."

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, September 7th: Athens dispatch: The morale of the Greek Royalist fascist army is very low in the face of the victorious offensive of the Democratic Army. The Greek reactionaries, in order to save their dangerous situation, are resorting to prisons and gallows. In addition to establishing a concentration camp on Crete for "unstable" officers, the Greek government has recently established special courts to try government officers and soldiers who refuse to fight the guerrillas. Dozens are sentenced to death or life imprisonment every day. Greek Emperor Paul III issued an order similar to a "mobilization order" on the 3rd, announcing military censorship of the press, suspending constitutional provisions regarding freedom of the press, and prohibiting strikes by civil servants, but the Greek people regard this order as worthless. The Civil Servants' Union has announced a strike starting on the 4th, with the slogan "Rather die in the streets than in the office."

　　胜利攻势席卷全国
  　希民主军南北会师
    【新华社陕北四日电】雅典讯：希腊民主军之攻势已席卷全国。据民主军八月三十一日公报称：民主军续在全国积极作战。在希腊东北部，民主军强大支队解放科摩替尼区之雷维第安德居民区，并切断亚历山大罗波斯（土希边境重要港口）与科摩替尼之铁路干线交通。在希北之爱地萨的佛罗里那区，民主军部队正继续胜利挺进中。在希南之波罗奔尼萨（即摩里亚半岛）区，民主军正攻击敌据点希塔内亚，并在麦新纳区进行激战。在希西，激战仍在爱匹鲁斯山岳地区进行中。
    【新华社陕北七日电】雅典讯：希民主军在全国继续进军，在希腊中部，自南北两路向宾都斯中部前进之民主军某部，占领村庄八处后都已会师。民主军缴获大量保皇党匪徒遗弃的军备与武器，并俘敌五十名。通过爱匹鲁斯南下之民主军精锐部队一千五百人，亦于三日在阿希洛与南部游击队会师。拉米城附近民主军攻占村庄三处。在波罗奔尼萨，民主军击破敌人抵抗占领克诺利区之兰加第亚村。自八月二十六日至八月底，民主军毙伤敌一千一百二十名，俘敌九十四名。
    【新华社陕北四日电】雅典讯：希民主军广播在评论希腊美国宠儿曹达利斯组成内阁时，坚定而充满信心地说：“如果说上次七党联合都未能镇压住希腊人民，那么曹达利斯一人就更不能有何作为。”广播指出：“只有推翻美英加诸希腊的政治统治，停止外国干涉，全国民主力量平等地组成有广泛群众基础的政府，乃是摆脱目前希腊混乱与内战的唯一途径。”按希腊小皇朝统治集团内部，最近在民主军攻势发展下，更陷于恐慌与混乱中，曹达利斯在组成一党内阁后，益在孤立，甚至保皇派报纸亦称之为“灾难政府”与“不幸的早产婴儿。”
    【新华社陕北七日电】雅典讯：希保皇党法西斯军队在民主军胜利攻势下，士气十分颓丧。希反动派为挽救其危险局势，乃求助于监狱及绞架。希政府除已在克里特岛建立一“不稳”军官的集中营外，最近又设立特别法庭，审讯拒绝和游击队作战的政府军官兵，每日被判死刑无期徒刑者常达数十起。希儿皇帝保罗三日更颁布类似“动员令”的命令，宣布新闻实行军事检查，停止宪法上关于出版自由之规定，禁止公务员罢工，但希腊人民视此命令如同废纸。公务员联合会仍宣布自四日实行罢工，他们的口号是“宁死于街上，不死于办公室。”
