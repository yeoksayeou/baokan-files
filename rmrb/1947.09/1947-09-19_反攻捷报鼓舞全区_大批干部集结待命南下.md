　　Xinhua News Agency, Jinji Luyu, 17th: Since the news of the nationwide counter-offensive was broadcast from northern Shaanxi, the excitement and jubilation in towns and villages throughout the Jinji Luyu region have been like the situation two years ago during the counter-offensive against the Japanese invaders. Cadres in various places have enthusiastically responded to the Central Committee's call and actively requested their superiors to go south and work in the most glorious positions in the provinces north of the Yangtze River. The first batch of ×× people has already departed, and now the second batch of ×× people has gathered and is standing by. When Xu Qinglou and 17 other workers from the Jinan Military Region's repair shop bid farewell to their fellow workers, they all said with joy, "See you at the Hanyang Arsenal!" Mr. Gao Yanliu, a democratic personage from Henan currently residing in the Taiyue region, told reporters, "Good! Good! The people of Henan have a way out! They will rise up to capture Liu Maoen (the Kuomintang's Henan Province Chairman) and all the big and small bastards who run rampant in the countryside, and realize the 'land to the tiller' policy." On the streets of Yangcheng, in addition to the victory reports displayed on large colorful paper, many shops also filled their billboards with victory news.

　　Taiyue, 16th: Upon hearing the news of the great victory of Liu and Deng's army, Liu Zhong and Wang Hefeng, leaders of the Taiyue Military Region, sent a special telegram on behalf of the people of the entire region to Liu, Deng, and all the commanders and fighters to congratulate them. The original telegram is as follows:

　　With your victorious march, a new situation of a comprehensive counter-offensive has been opened up. The people of Taiyue, upon hearing the news of your sweeping through the Central Plains, reaching the Dabie Mountains, and fighting to the Yangtze River, are filled with joy throughout the region. On behalf of the people of the entire region, we congratulate you and actively take action to support the southern expeditionary army and fight for the early overthrow of Chiang Kai-shek's evil rule.
