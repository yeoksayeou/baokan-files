Small Stories from Behind Enemy Lines
　　Unyielding and Indomitable
　　Hero's Certificate Enrages Chiang's Bandit Troops
Wang Chuanjin is the militia platoon leader of Xiaowu Village, District Three, @ Mountain. He is 25 years old this year and was selected as a blasting hero at the last militia conference. On August 13th, he led three militiamen in activities in Xiwang Village. Unfortunately, they were captured by the enemy. The enemy wanted to get some information from him, so they gave them food and drink and asked about the whereabouts of the troops. Wang Chuanjin said angrily, "I don't know anything! Kill me if you want, I'm the blasting team leader!" The other three insisted that they were stretcher-bearing laborers. When soft tactics failed, the enemy interrogated them with clubs and bayonets. Wang Chuanjin was beaten to the point of death and revived four times, but he didn't say a word. Finally, he thought he was going to die anyway, so he might as well die a heroic death. He took out the blasting merit certificate hidden in his clothes, which enraged the enemy, who grinned and asked, "Hero! How many Central Army soldiers have you killed?" "Eight!" Wang Chuanjin replied sharply. After saying his last words, the enemy tied him to a tree and stabbed him to death with bayonets. When the three militiamen escaped under the cover of night, they saw Wang Chuanjin's bloody corpse hanging on the tree, as if he was smiling and saying, "I died gloriously!"

　　Don't Say Anything Even if You're Beaten to Death
Xiao Heitou of Fancun, @ Mountain, is only sixteen years old and a poor member of the Children's Corps. This time, when the enemy came to Fanzhuang, Xiao Heitou didn't have time to escape and was tied up by the enemy. They beat him from the west end of the village to the east end, and from the east end to the west end, asking him for guns and telling him to point out the door of the village cadres. Xiao Heitou thought that he had already suffered, and if he said anything, someone else would suffer too. So he simply said, "I don't know." "Good Eighth Route Army brat, if you don't talk, we'll beat you!" Xiao Heitou was beaten unconscious. His sixty-year-old father, Cai Xiangting, wanted to run to the enemy and beg for mercy, but when he walked to his child, who had been beaten speechless, he said sternly, "You are my child, you can't say anything even if you're beaten to death." The enemy was furious and plundered all of Xiao Heitou's family's belongings, even smashing the water tank and leaving nothing behind. But they never got a word out of him.

　　敌后小故事
  　坚贞不屈
  　取出英雄证　气煞蒋匪军
    王传金是＠山三区小吴庄的民兵班长，今年廿五岁，上次民兵大会上被选为爆炸英雄。八月十三日，他领的三个民兵在西旺村活动，不幸被敌人捕去，敌想在他口中得些材料，好好的给他们吃喝，问他们部队去向，王传金就愤愤的说：“啥也不知道！要杀就杀，我是爆炸组长！”他三个咬定是抬担架的民夫。敌人用软法失败了，就用棍子刺刀审讯，王传金被殴打死复活四次，但均未说出一句话，最后他想反正是死，不如死个痛快，随把衣裳里隐藏着的爆炸功劳证拿出来，气得敌狞笑着问：“英雄！你杀了几个中央军？”“八个！”王传金厉声回答。说完最后一句话，敌人即把他捆到树上，用刺刀穿死了。当那三个民兵星夜逃出时，还见王传金的尸骨血肉模糊的挂在树上，他好象微笑着说：“我死的光荣！”
    打死也别说
    ＠山范村的小黑头，今年才十六岁，是个贫穷的儿童团员，这次敌人到了范庄，小黑头没跑得及，被敌人捆绑起来，从村西头打到东头，从东头打到村西头，问他要枪，叫他指村干的门，小黑头想反正自己已受了，再说别人又多一个遭殃的，于是就干脆说：“不知道”，“好个八路羔子，不说就揍！”小黑头被打断了气。他六十岁的父亲蔡向亭想跑来向敌人哀求，但当他走到被打得不会说话的孩子面前时，反而声色俱厉的说：“你是我的孩子，打死也不能说。”敌人恼了，把小黑头家的财物掠夺一尽，连水缸也打破不留。但他终没得到一句话。
