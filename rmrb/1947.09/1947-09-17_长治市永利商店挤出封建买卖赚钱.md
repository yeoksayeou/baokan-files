Changzhi City Yongli Store
Squeezes Out Feudal Business Practices to Make Money
[This report from Changzhi] Before Changzhi City's Yongli Store squeezed out feudalism in the first half of the year, the partners were not united, and business was not vigorous. In the first half of the year, they only earned 150,000 yuan. After a review meeting, it was pointed out that the accountant, Li Xiaoqing, was a feudal landlord. When the manager went out to buy goods, he showed off and acted rudely to the partners, who all had opinions about him, leading to low morale. After Li Xiaoqing was squeezed out in the Changzhi City store's campaign to eliminate feudalism last month, the store's partners became energized. In two meetings, they reviewed why they hadn't made money in the first half of the year, and then they formulated a production and savings plan. The partners voluntarily reduced their monthly wages by 1.75 *shi* of rice, and their production enthusiasm was very high. They also pledged to complete the annual production task in the second half of the year. In August alone, they earned more than 600,000 yuan.
