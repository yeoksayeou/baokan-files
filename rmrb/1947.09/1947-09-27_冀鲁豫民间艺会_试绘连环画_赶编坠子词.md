[This newspaper's Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region dispatch, dated 22nd of this month] On the 15th of this month, upon hearing the news of the great counter-offensive, every member of the Folk Art Federation cheered and eagerly prepared themselves, expressing the working attitude they should adopt to strive for victory in the future: Cartoonists Gao Huailin and Zhang Shouchun are busy trying to draw comic strips of the great counter-offensive, using pictures to illustrate the situation of the counter-offensive. The "Zhui Zi" performers Xiao Guangshang, Zhou Yuanlan, and Director Shen Fu are actively composing new lyrics for the great counter-offensive. Many comrades are intensifying their learning of the newly composed lyrics, preparing to expand propaganda. In particular, Wang Jing, an old artist in his sixties who had requested leave to return home, and Wang Luobin, a comrade who is blind, upon hearing the news of the great counter-offensive, braved the rain and rushed back to the office day and night, not letting go of a moment of time, to study singing. At present, male and female comrades in each team are seizing the time to work hard in order to welcome this new and great victory of the counter-offensive.
