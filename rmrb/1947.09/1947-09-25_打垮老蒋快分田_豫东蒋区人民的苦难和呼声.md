　　(I) The Disaster of the People in the Chiang-Controlled Areas
　　While traveling south with a certain unit of Liu Deng's army, this reporter passed through areas well-known for suffering from floods, droughts, locust plagues, and the scourge of Tang (Tang Enbo) in eastern and southeastern Henan, including Sui County, Huaiyang, Runan, and Zhengyang. For several years, most of the people have fled to escape disaster. After the Japanese surrendered, Chiang Kai-shek's tyrannical rule followed closely, seizing men for conscription and forcing grain levies, making life unbearable. The villages the reporter passed through were mostly dilapidated, with a third of the fields lying barren and uncultivated. There were very few young and middle-aged people in the countryside, and the women, children, and elderly were all emaciated from hunger. Livestock was also rarely seen. According to residents in various places, most of the young and middle-aged men have been seized by Chiang's bandits to serve as soldiers, and those who remain have mostly fled with their livestock. In Wangtun Township, thirty miles southwest of Huaiyang, the reporter watched more than twenty people sitting on the ground, crying and complaining to the commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army about the atrocities of Chiang's bandits. They said: There was a drought in the 30th year of the Republic of China (1941), and locust plagues from the 31st to the 33rd years (1942-1944), and then floods in the 34th and 35th years (1945-1946). During the locust plagues, more than thirty people starved to death in the village. But Chiang's bandits disregarded the life and death of the people, and exorbitant taxes and levies increased rather than decreased. This year's land tax has already been collected twice. In the spring, seventeen catties of wheat per mu were paid, plus 1,500 yuan in Chiang currency. During the wheat harvest, another thirteen catties of wheat per mu were paid, plus 2,000 yuan, and more will be collected in the autumn. As for other donations and taxes, such as military wheat, substitute wheat purchases, food wheat for the township office, sesame, beans, military grass, military supplies, shoes, socks, firewood, etc., there are many kinds, and their amount exceeds several times the regular tax. Of the 130 households in the village, twenty able-bodied men were conscripted last year, and five more are to be taken recently, and they must also bring five guns. Wang Zhong, 55 years old, said, "I have never seen a year where grain is collected several times. Anyway, whenever they want to issue a slip with a red stamp, it's an official matter, and you have to give it. If you don't, you will be locked up. Chiang Kai-shek, you bastard, you are so heartless. In our village, Wang Mancang had a bad harvest in the 32nd year (1943), and he hadn't eaten for several days. He was starving to death, but the township office still sent people to demand payment. Wang really couldn't afford it, and they strangled him to death." Wang Zhong finally sighed and said, "At this time, you can't make a living by farming."
　　(II) The People Welcome the People's Liberation Army
　　When the southward army passed through the Chiang-controlled rural areas near the Yu-Wan-Su Liberated Area in the Qiao County area, there were already slogans posted such as "Chairman Mao is the savior of the Chinese people" and "Welcome the People's Liberation Army." The reporter stayed in the home of a man surnamed Wang in Weitinglou, northwest of Minquan. There was only an old woman, her daughter-in-law, and a small grandson in the family. Her family of five rented ten mu of land from the landlord, and had to pay half of the harvest as rent. In the summer alone, they paid Chiang's bandits seventeen catties of wheat per mu. Now they bring back sorghum from the fields that is not yet ripe to eat; but when she heard that the People's Liberation Army had arrived, she quickly ground half of the only two dou of wheat she had to feed the army. Her man in his sixties and her son both volunteered to lead the way for the People's Liberation Army. The old woman was busy boiling water and cooking for us, and said, "Our Eighth Route Army is good, they don't beat or scold people, they buy and sell fairly. The last time Chiang's troops passed by here, we all ran away. They were like wolves, rummaging and eating everything, and before they left, they grabbed chickens, twisted their heads off, and stuffed them into their pockets." Tian Fengzhen from Tianlou Village, Huaiyang, is 62 years old, with a wife and son at home. He has eight fen of land of his own, but because he owed the landlord in his village 1,000 yuan, the landlord wanted 20,000 in return. Last year, he sold his only eight fen of land; now he rents one mu of land (equivalent to two city mu) from others, and has to pay eight dou of rent every year. He said: The harvest for a year is only enough to pay the rent, and he can only earn some money by weaving mats out of straw. He said: Last year, Chiang's army grabbed him to repair fortifications for a month, and he was beaten every day. His legs were swollen from the beating. He slept for two months when he came back, and the whole family was starving and crying. When he heard about the situation of the peasants turning over in the Liberated Areas, he was so happy that he almost jumped up. He quickly asked, "When will you divide the land for us? You quickly defeat Old Chiang, that grandson of a turtle."
　　(III) Don't be Chiang's Bandit, Be the Eighth Route Army
　　In Song Shao Village, southwest of the county seat, 81-year-old Song Shengtian has a family of five, and used to cultivate ten mu of land with only one son. Since the year before last, he has been ordered three times to send his only son to become a soldier. Each time, the old man stubbornly resisted the township office, who arrested him, held him in confinement and severely beat him. Last year he was confined for more than twenty days, and he couldn't move for half a month after he came back. Each time he had to sell land, hire someone to replace him, or send money to the township office to settle the matter. Mentioning these things, the old man choked, pointing to his half-pants that revealed his buttocks, and said: "Poor people can't live here. The rich families in our village have six sons, but they don't have to provide soldiers; the people here are all like my old bones, black and thin, without even a bit of meat. We have long heard from people who do business to the north that the Eighth Route Army is good, and that poor people have turned over there. You came to avenge us poor people. If I were a few years younger, I would be a turtle grandson if I didn't join the Eighth Route Army." Yes, the young people here are taking active actions to join the People's Liberation Army to turn over and take revenge. On August 25th, when we were staying in Qilin Village, Zhengyang County, a 22-year-old young peasant voluntarily ran to ask to join our army. His name is Chen Zhenhan, from Wangdian, Zhengyang County. Within a month, he had been conscripted three times by the bailiff, and he had escaped twice. On the 24th day of the sixth lunar month, he was sitting and enjoying the cool at the door when the bailiff grabbed him and told him to become a soldier. He was so angry that he picked up a bench and beat the bailiff to death. He fled to his relatives' home to hide; when he heard that the People's Liberation Army had arrived, he voluntarily ran to join. He said: "No one among the people here wants to be Chiang's soldier and die for him. If you stay here, many people will join the Eighth Route Army." People everywhere helped our army grind flour, boil water, and cook with unparalleled enthusiasm. On a dark night, while it was raining, when we passed through Litun and Pengzhuang Villages in Huaiyang County in the middle of the night, the village entrances were filled with water vats, buckets, and basins. Many bowls were placed on tables by the roadside, lit with lamps, and forty or fifty male and female peasants were gathered there, busy serving water to the soldiers. They said: "Because yesterday, the Chiang army's security regiment went to the countryside to seize laborers and soldiers, we all hid. We heard that you came, so we came back. We didn't prepare anything, just boil some water to show our sincerity." The wealthy families here are the same, welcoming the People's Liberation Army. When our army left Renzhuang, Runan, the 61-year-old mother of Ren Guanhua, who is a small landlord, burned incense and prayed in front of the idol, saying: "God bless you to live here for a long time and have a peaceful life. Chiang's troops want soldiers and money, making it impossible for us to live."

    打垮老蒋快分田
    豫东蒋区人民的苦难和呼声
    张铁夫
    （一）蒋管区人民的灾难
    记者随刘邓大军某部南下途中，穿过雎县、淮阳、汝南、正阳等豫东、豫东南一带有名的受过水、旱、蝗、汤（汤恩伯）灾害的地区，数年来，人民大多四出逃难。日寇投降后，紧接着又来了蒋贼的暴虐统治，抓丁逼粮，横征暴军，弄得民不聊生。记者所经之村庄都残破不堪，田地三分之一荒芜未耕，农村中青壮年极少，妇孺老弱皆因饥饿面黄肌瘦；牲畜也很少见到。据各地居民说：大部青壮年已被蒋匪抓去当兵，剩下来大多牵着牲口逃跑了。记者在淮阳西南三十里之王屯乡，看着二十多个群众围坐在地上，向人民解放军指战员哭诉蒋匪暴行。他们说：民国三十年旱灾，三十一至三十三年连遭蝗灾，三十四三十五年又被水淹，闹蝗灾时，村里就饿死了三十余人。但蒋匪不顾人民死活，苛捐杂税有增无减，今年征地税，已收了两次，春天每亩地交十七斤麦子，外加一千五百元蒋币，收麦子，每亩又交十三斤麦子，外加两千元，到秋里还要收。至于其他捐税什么军麦、代购麦、乡公所的伙食麦、芝麻、豆子、军草、军料、鞋袜、柴草等种类繁多，其数目超过正税数倍。该村一百三十户人，去年抓去了廿个壮丁，最近又要去五个，还要带上五支枪。五十五岁的王忠说：“我从没见过一年要完几次粮的，反正啥时想要开个条子盖个红印就是公事，你就得给，不给就要关起来。蒋介石王八蛋，真太没心肝。我们村里王满仓，三十二年收成不好，几天没有吃饭，饿的快死了，但乡公所还派人来要款，王实在出不起，被他们一把勒死了。”王忠最后叹气说：“这时候指望种地是活不成了。”
  （二）人民欢迎解放军
    南下大军通过瞧县一带，靠近豫皖苏解放区的蒋区农村时，那里已张贴着“毛主席是中国人民的救星”、“欢迎人民解放军”等标语。记者住在民权西北魏亭楼一家姓王的家里，家里只有一个老太太和他儿媳妇，一个小孙子。她家五口人，租种地主十亩地，要把收获的一半交租，只夏季每亩就给蒋匪交了十七斤麦子，现在她们把地里还未熟透的高粱弄回来吃；但当他听说人民解放军来了之后，赶忙把仅有的二斗麦子磨了一半送给军队吃。她六十多岁的男人和她儿子都自动给解放军带路去了。老太太一边忙着给我们烧水做饭，一边说：“咱八路好，不打人不骂人，公买公卖，老蒋的队伍上回从这里过，我们都跑了，他们象狼一样，啥都翻着吃了，临走还提着小鸡子把头一拧装到口袋里带走了。”淮阳田楼村田丰珍，六十二岁，家里一妻一子，自己有八分地，因欠本村地主一千元债，地主要还两万，去年他便把仅有的八分地卖了；现在租种人家一亩地（合二市亩），每年要交八斗租子。他说：一年收成仅够交租，只能赚些秸编席子卖。他说：去年蒋军抓他去修了一月工事，天天挨打，腿被打肿了。回来睡了两个月，饿的全家人只是哭。当他听到解放区农民翻身的情形时，他高兴的几乎跳起来，他连忙问：“你们啥时候给俺分地呢？你赶快把老蒋这龟孙都打完吧”。
  （三）不当蒋匪当八路
    该县城西南宋劭村，八十一岁的老汉宋生田五口人，过去种十亩地，只有一个儿子。自前年至今三次要抽他独子去当兵，每次都是老头子硬顶着乡公所把他抓去关禁闭毒打。去年被关禁闭二十多天，回来半月不能动，每次都是卖了地雇人顶替或给乡公所送钱才了事。提起这些事，老汉哽咽的指着他露着屁股的半截裤子说：“在这里穷人活不了，俺村老财家有六个儿子，反倒不出兵；俺这里百姓都象我这老骨头一样，又黑又瘦，连一点肉也没了，我们早就从往北边做生意的人听说八路军好，你那里穷人都翻了身，你来了给俺穷人报仇吧。我要是再年青几岁，不参加八路军是个龟孙”。是的，这里的年青人在用积极的行动参加人民解放军翻身报仇。八月廿五日，我们住在正阳县凄林村时，一个廿二岁的年青农民，自动跑来要求参加我军。他名叫陈振韩，正阳县王店人，一月内他曾被保长抓丁三次，两次他都逃掉了。阴历六月廿四日，他正在门口坐着乘凉，保丁一把抓住他要他去当兵，他气极了，拿起板橙一下子打死×保丁，自己逃到亲戚家里躲起来；听说人民解放军来了，便自动跑来参加。他说：“这里老百姓谁也不愿给老蒋当兵送死，要是你们住下来，一定有很多人参加八路军。”各地群众都以无比的热情，帮我军磨面、烧水做饭。在一个漆黑的夜晚，天还下着雨，我们夜半通过淮阳县李屯、彭庄村时，村头上摆满了水缸、水桶、水盆，路边桌子上放着许多碗，点着明灯，四五十个男女农民围在那里，忙着给战士端水喝。他们说：“因为昨天城里蒋军保安团下乡抓夫、抓军，我们都躲了，听说你们来了，我们才回来，没准备啥，烧点水表示我们的心意。”这里富人家也一样，欢迎人民解放军。我军离开汝南任庄时，任冠华六十一岁的母亲是个小地主，他在神像面前烧香祷告说：“老天爷保佑你们长住在俺这里过安生日子，老蒋队伍要兵要款，弄得俺不能活了。”
