[This report from our newspaper in Taiyue, dated the 5th] Workers, peasants, and soldiers are all one family. Units, factories, and organs throughout the region are actively purging targets of struggle and blocking "air-raid shelters." Amidst the surging wave of land reform in the entire region, Comrade Yuan Congrui, a staff officer of a certain unit of the Jinan Field Army, after examining his thoughts, heard that the masses in his village were carrying out struggles. He immediately returned home and handed over his landlord family to the masses, saying, "All the assets of my family are from exploiting everyone. Now I hand over all the property to you." The masses were overjoyed and repeatedly praised: "The Eighth Route Army is good, soldiers and farmers are one family." A certain unit passed through Liu Ming Village in Anyi and discovered that landlords were transferring things. They detained both the people and the things and handed them over to the masses. Soldiers of a certain unit, while standing guard, captured three targets of struggle and handed them all over to the masses. Cadres of a certain unit also helped the cadres of Dongwangdi Village in Anyi with their work. All the employees of the Taiyue Ruiji Cigarette Factory discovered that Wang Zizhe, a target of struggle, had infiltrated the factory this spring, stealthily taking the position of deputy manager. He had consistently engaged in sabotage and incited discord. After his crimes were exposed by workers and apprentices, the leadership immediately allowed all employees to thoroughly struggle against him, and finally handed him over to the masses. Now the factory's trade union has proposed: "From now on, we will not accept a single target of struggle and will thoroughly investigate and squeeze out feudal elements." The Directly Subordinate Transportation Station of the Taiyue Trading Company originally thought that all the transporters were from worker and peasant backgrounds, but after seeing the district party committee's instruction to block landlords' "air-raid shelters," they actively inspected the inside and also found four targets of struggle: Jiao Gougou, Guo Mantang, Zhao Wan'di, and Zhao Chenhe. Transporter Wang Sanfa said, "No wonder our team has always been disunited. It turns out that these targets of struggle were causing trouble. Last year, when we were transporting goods in Yicheng, these targets even stole things." Transportation Captain Liu Honghe said very firmly: "The places led by Chairman Mao must cleanse targets of struggle. The government belongs to the people, let's see where they can run." Li Xiaoxiong, a landlord, infiltrated the Zhaocheng Sanmin High School and took on production work. In one year, in addition to making a mess of the school's production, he also incited discord between the masses and the school. This time, after all the teachers and students studied land reform, they first purged Li Xiaoxiong from within the school. Under the righteous indignation of all the teachers and students, a struggle was carried out, and he was handed over to the masses for handling.

　　坚决站在人民方面
  　太岳各机关堵塞防空洞
  　彻底扫清隐蔽地主
    【本报太岳五日电】工农兵都是一家人，全区部队、工厂机关积极清洗斗争对象，堵塞“防空洞”。在全区农民轰轰烈烈的土改运动的浪潮中，晋南野战兵团某部参谋原丛瑞同志，经过检查思想后，听到本村群众闹斗争，立即回家把他的地主家庭，交给群众说：“我家全部家产都是剥削大家的，现在将全部财物交给大家。”群众喜得连称：八路军好，兵农是一家。某部从安邑留名村经过，发现地主向外转移东西，连人带东西一齐扣住，交给群众。某部战士站岗放哨，连查住三个战斗对象，皆交给群众。某部干部并帮助安邑东旺底村干部工作。太岳瑞记烟厂全体职工，发现斗争对象王子哲于今春钻入该厂，窃任副经理职位，一贯破坏挑拨离间，其罪恶被工人学徒揭露后，领导上即允许全体职工彻底斗争，最后并交给群众。现该厂工会提出：“今后不收一个斗争对象，彻底查挤封建。”太岳贸易公司直属运输栈，原以为全体运输员，皆是工农出身，但在看到区党委堵塞地主“防空洞”的指示后，便积极检查内部，亦查出斗争对象焦苟苟、郭满堂、赵晚弟、赵陈河四人。运输员王三发说：“怪不得咱们队里老不团结，原来就是这伙斗争对象在捣鬼。去年在翼城运货，这伙对象还偷东西。”运输队长刘红合很坚决的说：“毛主席领导的地方，都要清洗斗争对象，政府是人民的，看他往那里跑。”赵城三民高，混进了地主李小雄担任生产工作，一年中除将学校的生产闹的一塌糊涂外，并挑拨群众与学校的关系，此次全体师生学习土改后，首先从学校内部清洗了李小雄，在全体师生的义愤下，斗争了一场，交给群众处理。
