    Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 24th—The military and civilians in Yidong County, Luzhong District, have launched a comprehensive offensive against the Chiang-occupied areas on both sides of the Qing (zhou) Lin (yi) Ju (xian) Lin (yi) Highway, combining military, political, and transportation tactics. In early August alone, they fought 64 battles, killing or wounding 33 Chiang bandits, capturing 51 alive, and disintegrating 160, seizing a large amount of ammunition. More than 10,000 people repeatedly destroyed over 200 li of the Qing (zhou) Lin (yi) and Ju (xian) Lin (yi) highways. What the Chiang bandits repaired during the day, the masses destroyed again at night, causing great difficulties in the transport and supply of bandits invading the Bin Hai area. The military and civilians of the county also used methods such as surrounding strongholds and shouting to persuade Chiang bandits to seek a way out as soon as possible. In one village, more than 80 Chiang bandits fled overnight, and 80 soldiers from the new recruit regiment of the 83rd Division of the Chiang bandits in Heyang also deserted together.

    Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 24th—The Lunan District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently issued instructions, calling on the entire Party and army to take action together to resolutely complete land reform in guerrilla warfare. The instructions emphasized: It is necessary to overcome the erroneous idea that "land reform cannot be carried out in guerrilla areas." It called on all comrades participating in the land reform work to take up guns, fight when the enemy comes, and distribute land when the enemy leaves. All backbone regiments, county and district armed work teams must participate in land reform work. At the same time, in the land reform, it is necessary to guide the masses from wanting land to protecting land, participating in armed struggle, using poor and hired peasants as the backbone, establishing county detachments, district companies, township armed work teams, and village guerrilla groups to suppress landlord bandit activities, protect the interests of farmers, and consolidate rural positions, so that armed struggle and land are closely linked. Finally, it repeatedly pointed out: Due to the arrival of the great counter-offensive situation, the enemy is forced to disperse, and most of the Lunan area has been restored. It is a good time for land reform, and it must be accelerated, doing one village at a time until all are done well.

    In addition, the Lunan District Committee has transferred more than 30 cadres to form a land reform work team to work in Feixian County. The work team is also equipped with capable armed forces to distribute land and fight at the same time, supporting the land reform movement.

    鲁中沂东县军民展开军政交结合攻势
    【新华社山东二十四日电】鲁中区沂（水）东县军民以军事、政治、交通，三者结合之攻势，向青（州）临（沂）莒（县）临（沂）公路两侧蒋占区，展开全面出击，仅八月上旬，即作战六十四次，毙伤蒋匪三十三名，生俘五十一名，瓦解一百六十名，缴获大批弹药。并有万余群众反复破击青（州）临（沂）莒（县）临（沂）两公路二百余里，蒋匪白天修了，群众夜间再破，使东犯滨海之匪，运输补给遭受极大困难。该县军民更以包围据点喊话等方式劝导蒋匪早寻生路。某村蒋匪八十余人一夜间全部逃散，河阳蒋匪八十三师新兵团亦有八十人相率逃亡。
    【新华社山东二十四日电】中共鲁南区党委顷发布指示，号召全党全军一齐动手，在游击战争中坚决完成土地改革。指示强调指出：要克服“游击区不能做土改”的错误观念。号召一切参加土改工作同志必须拿起枪杆，敌来作战，敌去分田，所有基干兵团，县区武装武工队都要参加土改工作。同时在土改中，必须引导群众由要田到保田，参加武装斗争，以贫雇农为骨干，建立县大队、区中队、乡武工队、村游击小组，镇压地主匪特活动，保护农民利益，巩固农村阵地，使武装斗争与土地紧密结合。最后反复指出：由于大反攻形势到来，敌人被迫分散，鲁南地区大部恢复，是土地改革的好时机，务须加紧进行，有一村作一村，直到全部作好为止。
    又讯：鲁南区党委已抽调三十余干部，组成土改工作团，开赴费县地区工作。该工作团并配有精干武装，一面分田，一面打仗，支持土改运动。
