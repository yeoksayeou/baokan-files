Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 10th. Du Genzhao, squad leader of a certain squad under General Wang Zhen, has been promoted to company political instructor due to his outstanding leadership. For two and a half years, no one in his squad has deserted, making him a model for consolidating troops. The squad has followed the army on expeditions to the south and north, advancing from Yan'an to Guangdong, and breaking through from the Central Plains to return safely to the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region. They have also participated in the current battle to defend the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region and liberate Northwest China. In the arduous environment of long marches and battles, Du Genzhao has always united the entire squad like a family. In 1934, when the troops broke through the heavy blockade of the Japanese invaders and went south to Zaoyang County, Hubei, Du Genzhao was transferred from an infantry company to an artillery company as a squad leader. All the squad members, except for the deputy squad leader, were new recruits who had just been liberated. During continuous marching and fighting, they felt they could not endure the hardship. Du Genzhao explained the nature of the People's Army and why they were fighting to the new recruits during the march, constantly encouraging them. In the Dingbashan victory, the squad's soldiers had been liberated for only eight days, but each became a heroic and outstanding People's Fighter. In the breakout from the Central Plains in July of last year, the situation was urgent, and the roads were rugged. Livestock could not carry the artillery, so Du Genzhao carried the gun barrel on his back throughout the march. When the troops entered the high mountains and ridges of the Qinling Mountains in southern Shaanxi, Du Genzhao was transferred to the rear guard of an infantry company to take in stragglers. He often carried two or three rifles for the wounded and sick soldiers, and even carried a machine gun on his shoulder during long marches. When the troops advanced to the desolate Taibai Mountain, the superiors called on everyone to bring their own pots to cook. Du Genzhao carried two pots by himself. When the whole squad was on military sentry duty during encampments, he would go down to the river to fetch water and firewood, cook the meals, and deliver them to the mountain for everyone to eat. When the troops broke through the Xi'an-Lanzhou Highway and crossed the Longhai Railway, they marched three hundred and sixty li in two days and nights. Du Genzhao let his comrades rest and cooked meals and baked dry rations for everyone. He even marched barefoot himself, taking off his shoes to give to comrades who had no shoes. He loves the soldiers, and the soldiers love him. Everyone unanimously recognizes him as a People's Hero who never bows to difficulties. Du Genzhao is thirty years old this year and came from a hired worker's background.

　　人民英雄杜根照
  　荣获巩固部队模范
    【新华社晋绥十日电】王震将军所部某班班长杜根照由于他杰出的领导，两年半以来全班没有一个人开小差，成为巩固部队的模范，现已跃升其为连指导员。该班曾随军南征北战，由延安挺进至广东，又从中原突围安返陕甘宁边区。并参加这次保卫陕甘宁边区解放大西北之战。在长期行军作战的艰苦环境中，杜根照一贯把全班团结得象一家人。三十四年部队突破日寇重重封锁，南下至湖北枣阳县时，杜根照由步兵连调到炮兵连当班长，全班除副班长外，都是刚被解放过来的新战士。在连续行军和战斗中，他们感觉吃不下苦，杜根照就在行军中向新战士解释人民军队的本质和为什么而战，不断鼓励他们。丁拔山胜利战斗中，该班战士被解放不过八天，但个个都成了英勇出色的人民战士。去年七月中原突围之战，情况紧急，道路崎岖，牲口不能驮炮，杜根照一路背着炮身行军。部队进入陕南秦岭的高山重岭，杜根照被调任步兵连后卫担任收容，他经常替伤病员背着两三支步枪，长行军时更肩的机枪。部队向荒无人烟的太白山进发，上级号召自己带锅煮饭，杜根照独自担了两口锅。宿营时全班担任军事哨，他就下河挑水打柴，做好饭送到山上给大家吃。部队突破西兰公路冲过陇海铁路时，两昼夜急行军三百六十里，杜根照让战友休息，自己替大家做饭烙干粮，并且自己光着脚行军，把鞋子脱给没有鞋的战友穿，他热爱战士，战士也热爱他，大家一致公认他是从不向困难低头的人民英雄。杜根照今年三十岁，雇工出身。
