　　Snippets from the KMT Area
    ◇ Another tragic incident of American soldiers killing our compatriots occurred in Tianjin. According to the Tianjin Republican Daily, on the 5th of last month, a carpenter named Tang Tianxun was shot and killed by American soldiers stationed near the Chinese warehouse on Dagu Road while passing by.
    ◇ When the KMT troops in Andong and Tonghua withdrew, they deceived and took away more than 900 students, who are now detained in the "Student Reception Center" in Fushun. This place is called a "reception center," but it is actually a disguised concentration camp. Among every twenty students, there is a special agent student carrying a pistol to monitor them. If their words and actions are slightly displeasing, they are charged with "dissident activities" and subjected to punishment. Some have disappeared as a result. The living conditions in the "reception center" are extremely harsh. Each person receives only 300 KMT-issued circulation notes for food per day, and with heavy deductions, students cannot even fill their stomachs. At night, they sleep on the ground with only three pounds of straw. Many suffer from illnesses.
    ◇ The KMT government is preparing to restore and implement in a new form the fascist military training system, which has always been opposed by students, within its controlled areas, as a supplementary source to make up for the large losses of officers in the anti-people civil war. According to a TASS Shanghai dispatch on the 4th, citing the News Daily: The (KMT) Ministry of National Defense has drafted a plan to divide the country into several military districts for compulsory military training. The plan stipulates that middle school graduates will receive one year of military training and be appointed as second lieutenants when they serve in the military. University students will receive three months of military training and be appointed as first lieutenants.

　　蒋区零讯
    ◇天津又发生美军枪杀我同胞惨案。据天津民国日报讯：上月五日木匠唐天勋行经大沽道中国仓库附近时，即被驻该地之美军开枪击毙。
    ◇安东、通化蒋军撤退时，骗走学生九百余名，现均扣押在抚顺“学生收容处”中。该处名为“收容”，实则一变相集中营，每二十名学生中即有一佩带手枪的特务学生监视，言行稍一不合胃口，即被按上“异党活动”罪名，加以刑罚，有人因此失踪。“收容处”生活极苦，每人每日火食费仅发蒋记流通券三百元，再加上重重克扣，学生无法裹腹。夜间仅以稻草三斤席地而睡，患病者甚众。
    ◇蒋政府准备在其统治区域内恢复并以新的形式实行一向为学生反对的法西斯军训制度，作为其在反人民内战中军官大量损耗的补充来源。据塔斯社沪四日电引新闻报讯：（蒋记）国防部已拟定划分全国为若干军区的强迫军训计划。计划中规定中学毕业生受军训一年，服兵役时以少尉阶级任用。大学生受军训三个月，以上尉阶级任用。
