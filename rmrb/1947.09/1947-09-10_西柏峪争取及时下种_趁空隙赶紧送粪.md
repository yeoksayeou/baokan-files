　　Xibayu Strives to Sow Seeds in Time
  　Seizes Opportunity to Quickly Deliver Manure
    [This newspaper's report from Licheng] Most of the masses in Xibayu felt that after three or four rains in the past few days, the ground was too wet to enter, so they could only do odd jobs at home. The leadership saw this problem and convened a meeting of mutual aid team leaders, team leaders, cadres, and heroes on the morning of the 31st to discuss what we should do when the ground is wet. Liu Cheng'er said, "The ground is too wet to enter, the roads are slippery, and even manure can't be moved. Nothing can be done." Political Director Li Xiaoshou said, "The weather is getting late. The 24th is White Dew. We must plant wheat in our village by the end of White Dew to avoid being late. There are only half a month left. Most of the wheat fields have not been repaired, most of the double-plowed wheat fields have not been plowed, and fertilizer has not been transported to the fields. If we don't seize the time, I'm afraid it will be mixed with the wheat harvest in autumn. Either the sowing will be thin, or the embankments will not be repaired well, which will hinder deep plowing and fine cultivation to increase grain production." Hero Li Laohu said, "Although the ground is wet and the road is slippery, we must move manure. If not, we should first move it to the edge of the field. The slope is too slippery for livestock to go up. First, move it to the fields around the village without uphill or downhill slopes. If we don't do it, when the weather clears and the wheat fields are plowed, there will be no time to transport fertilizer." After a heated discussion, everyone realized that time was tight and that we should not become lax later after being diligent at first. So, the whole village changed shifts, no livestock was idle, and they actively took action. They transported fertilizer in three shifts, with three people driving six animals. In this way, one team saved three workdays a day. In three and a half days, thirty-eight animals transported 2,500 loads of fertilizer, and six teams saved a total of sixty-three workdays. The remaining labor force repaired wheat fields and scraped embankments. (Xibayu Correspondent Team Jianwen, Deming)

　　西柏峪争取及时下种
  　趁空隙赶紧送粪
    【本报黎城讯】西柏峪大部分群众，觉着这几天下了三两次雨，地里湿的不能进人，只能在家里做小零碎生活。领导上看出这个问题，就在三十一号上午召集互助组长、队长、干部、英雄，讨论地湿我们做甚生活，刘成儿说：“地湿不能进人，路上滑，连肥也不能搬，甚生活也做不得。”政治主任李小瘦说：“天气是不早啦，二十四就是白露，白露尾咱村麦总得种上才不晚，只有半个月光景了，麦地大部分没修理好，二犁麦地多数没有犁，肥也没有运到地里，天又不断下雨耽误，咱们如不抓紧时间，恐怕和赶小麦收秋弄在一起，不是薄种，就是修不好边堰，这对深耕细作增加产粮是有妨碍的。”英雄李老虎说：“虽然地湿路滑也得搬粪，不行先搬在地边，坡儿滑上不得牲口，先往村左右没有上下坡的地里搬，要不干，天晴了犁开麦地就没时间运肥了。”经过热烈的讨论，大家在思想上知道时间是紧张了，不要弄成了先松后紧，于是就全村大变工，不闲一个牲口，积极行动起来，并以倒三班运肥，三个人赶六个牲口，这样一天一组就省三个工，三天半共三十八个牲口运肥二千五百驮，六个组共省工六十三个，剩余劳力修麦地，刮边堰。（西柏峪通讯组建文、德明）
