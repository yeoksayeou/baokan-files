　　Fugitive Traitors and Tyrants in Yongnian City
  　Gnaw on Leather Shoes Out of Hunger
    [Report from this newspaper in Yongnian] Yongnian City has become a dead city under the strict blockade and encirclement by our army and people. The more than two thousand puppet bandits and more than three thousand fugitive landlords, despots, and puppet affiliates who are stubbornly defending the city walls are as thin as withered wood due to hunger. They are only relying on airplanes that cannot solve the problem to eke out a living. Each person eats twelve taels of rice per day, which is only ten taels after removing the soil. If the planes don't come, they will immediately go hungry. The leaves and Tribulus terrestris seedlings have all been eaten. The small fish, small insects, and aquatic plants in the moat could still be found nearby before, but now those without small boats cannot eat them anymore.
    Those evil landlords are getting even less rice, and they are so hungry that they have no choice but to exchange the silver ingots and gold they have been hoarding for food. One silver ingot (fifty taels) can only be exchanged for fourteen catties of red grain, and two silver ingots (one hundred taels) can only be exchanged for sixteen catties of wheat. A gold ring weighing two qian can only be exchanged for four catties of rice. Two cigarettes cost one silver dollar, and even buying a handful of aquatic plants costs 500 yuan in legal tender. A puppet soldier who escaped said: "Landlords have to go hungry even with silver ingots. At the worst times, they even eat the soles of their leather shoes." (Zhaochen)

　　永年城内逃亡奸霸
  　肚饿无米啃吃皮鞋
    【本报永年讯】永年城在我军民的严密封锁围困下，已成死城。孤守城垣二千余伪匪和三千余逃亡地主恶霸伪属们，已饿得瘦如枯柴。只是依靠不能济事的飞机，苟延残生。他们每人每天吃十二两大米，除土外不过十两，飞机一不来马上就饿肚，树叶、疾藜苗、都吃光了。城壕里的小鱼、小虫、水草，以前在近处还能摸到一些，现在没有小船的也吃不上了。
    那些恶霸地主们领到的大米更少，饿得没办法，将保藏多年的元宝、金子换粮食。一个银元宝（五十两重）仅换十四斤红粮，用二个银元宝（百两重）仅换麦子十六斤，二钱重的金戒指仅换四斤大米，两枝纸烟银元一块，就是买一把水草也得法币五百元。逃出的伪军说：“地主有了元宝也得挨饿，最利害的时候把皮鞋的底子都吃了。”（朝臣）
