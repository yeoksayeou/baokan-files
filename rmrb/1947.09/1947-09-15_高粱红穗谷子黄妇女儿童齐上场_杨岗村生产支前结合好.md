　　Sorghum Red Spikes, Millet Golden, Women and Children All Take to the Field
  　Yanggang Village Combines Production and Supporting the Front Well
    [Report from this newspaper, Ji-Lu-Yu, 13th] In Shou Zhang's Yanggang Village, women and children are all working together, combining support for the front with production. At the end of August, the young and strong men in the village all went to the embankment. The sorghum had red spikes and the millet was all golden, and it was time to harvest. The whole village held a meeting to discuss: the village has more than 90 mu of sorghum. What to do with the autumn harvest? The result of the discussion was that the village chief, the Farmers' Association chairman, the Women's Association chairman, and the Youth League director would each lead the children. Everyone would volunteer to complete one mu per day. The old ladies would stay at home to look after the children and cook, and the students, in addition to cutting sorghum, would also carry more than 100 loads of water every day, thus ensuring the smooth completion of the village's production work. In Liangcheng Township's Beimen Village, more than 70 young women, more than 40 members of the children's corps, and more than 30 members of the sisters' corps also formed mutual aid organizations to help the military families and the masses repairing the embankment to harvest the autumn crops. First, they registered how much sorghum each household had and divided the work. They completely harvested all the sorghum in one day, and the enthusiasm of the masses was extremely high.

    【本报冀鲁豫十三日电】寿张杨岗村妇女儿童齐动手，支前、生产结合好。八月底该村青壮年都上了堤，高粱红穗谷子全黄，已到收割时候，全村开会商量：全村九十多亩高粱，秋收怎么办？讨论结果，由村长、农会长、妇女会长、青年主任分头带领儿童，大家自报每人每天完成一亩，老太太在家看孩子、做饭，学生除砍高粱外，每天还挑一百多担水，因而使全村生产工作顺利的完成。良城镇北门村青年妇女七十多人、儿童团四十多人、姐妹团三十多人，也成立了互助组织，帮助军属及支前修堤群众秋收。先登记每户有多少高粱分工去作，一天内把所有的高粱完全收割完，群众情绪异常高涨。
