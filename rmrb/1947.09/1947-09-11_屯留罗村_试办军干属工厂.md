　　Trial Operation of Military Cadre Dependents' Factory
　　[Our Newspaper Taiyue, 8th dispatch] Tunliu Luo Village has successfully trialed a military cadre dependents' textile factory, solving various difficulties for the military cadre dependents. Luo Village has 82 military cadre dependents households. Their land, water, and firewood are all taken care of by mutual aid teams. Because the residences are scattered, the work of giving preferential treatment to military families is inconvenient. In addition, the husbands of some young women constantly send letters home asking their families to seek education and progress. In February of this year, under the advocacy of labor hero Guo Yutang, a military cadre dependents' textile factory was trialed, absorbing 21 military cadre dependents women to participate. A factory director and an accountant were democratically elected, and they were divided into three textile groups. All tools and textile funds were initially borrowed from the cooperative. From February to May, the profits earned, after deducting costs such as capital, food, and construction, could still be distributed as dividends. The principle is distribution according to labor, with the most receiving 1.5 shi of millet and the least receiving 4 dou of millet. Now the textile fund is completely self-sufficient. In addition, all 21 people have learned to spin cotton, and two-thirds of them have learned to weave cloth using hand-pulled shuttles. Zhang Hua, a cadre's dependent, said: "Before the factory was established, I was very depressed at home alone. When there was work to do, I didn't want to do it when I thought of my man. Since coming to the factory, everyone talks and laughs together, does more work, and also learns to read." Wang Chunxiang, a 14-year-old martyr's dependent, can spin four taels of cotton and weave five feet of cloth every day, and takes time to learn to read. She can now read the second volume of primary school textbooks. In her spare time, she also makes shoes and trousers for the soldiers at the front. She said: "My father sacrificed on the front line for the revolution. I must avenge my father, make more military shoes, let our troops wear them, and drive Chiang Kai-shek to the East China Sea to feed the turtles."

  　试办军干属工厂
    【本报太岳八日电】屯留罗村，试办军干属纺织工厂成功，解决了军干属各种困难。罗村有军干属八十二户，他们的土地、吃水、烧柴均由互助组照管，因住家分散，优军工作感到不便，再加上一些年青妇女的丈夫不断来信要家属求学进步，今年二月间，在劳动英雄郭玉堂倡导下，试办了个军干属纺织工厂，吸收军干属妇女二十一人参加，民主选出厂长、会计各一人，分三个纺织小组，一切工具及纺织基金，最初由合作社借给。自二月至五月，所获利润除本和伙食建设费等开支外，还能分红。原则是按劳分红，多的分到一石五斗小米，少的也分到四斗小米，现在纺织基金已完全可以自给。此外，二十一人都学会了纺花，其中有三分之二学会用手拉梭织布。干属张花的说：“工厂没成立时，我一人在家很苦闷，有活时想起男人也不想做，自到工厂后，大家一块说说笑笑，又多做了活，还识了字。”十四岁的烈属王春香每天能纺花四两、织布五尺，并抽时识字，现已能念通初小课本第二册，抽空还给前方战士做鞋做裤，她说：“俺爹为革命在前线上牺牲了，我一定给俺爹报仇，多做几双军鞋，给咱部队穿上，把蒋介石赶到东海里喂王八。”
