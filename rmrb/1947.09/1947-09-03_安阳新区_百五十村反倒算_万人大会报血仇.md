　　Anyang New District
　　150 Villages Reverse Land Reform
　　Ten Thousand Person Rally Announces Blood Feud
　　[Report from this newspaper] The newly recovered area of Anyang is currently vigorously carrying out a "reverse land reform" revenge movement. After a thorough review of the past leadership's insufficient support and freedom for the peasants, it was loudly proposed that the masses must be supported, and the demands of the masses must be resolutely met; those landlords, secret agents and special operatives who used black guns to shoot at us, we will shoot at them with bright guns, if they kill our whole family, we will kill their whole family. This firm support attitude powerfully encouraged the peasants in the new district to reverse the decisions of the land reform and take revenge, a movement to avenge blood debts. Therefore, in the first three days of this month, more than 150 villages in the new district of the whole county were involved in the reverse land reform movement. Landlords and secret agents who reversed land reform in various villages were tried by the people. On the night of August 5, the Second District arrested all the more than 60 landlords and secret agents who reversed land reform in the whole district. The masses in various villages were extremely excited and marched in the streets in teams at dawn, shouting "Execute the ringleader of the reversal of land reform, ××, execute the black gunner ××!" Radio stations in various villages also broadcast this victory message to the masses. The ringleaders and black gunners who had committed heinous crimes were immediately publicly tried and executed. Secondary elements returned everything they had taken back in the reverse land reform, even a single thread. The enthusiasm of the masses was unprecedentedly high. On the same day and night, village militia cadres in the Third District gathered, and the entire district was divided into five large armies, arresting 158 landlords, special agents and black gunners who had reversed land reform in 32 villages. Every militia cadre solemnly swore: "Anyone who lets go of a traitor or tyrant will be punished the same." On the 6th, reverse land reform revenge public trials were held in various villages, completely handled by the peasants themselves. The guys hated by the masses were executed on the spot. The Jiang Village Joint Defense in the Sixth District held a rally of 10,000 people on the 6th, where 32 leading culprits who reversed land reform were tried and executed by the masses. The Fucheng, Mashui, and Shuangquan Joint Defenses held even larger public trials of 20,000 peasants. More than 30 villages took action, and many landlords, under the power of the peasants, automatically returned the things they had taken back in the reverse land reform to the masses. The revenge movement against traitors and the reversal of land reform in more than 30 villages in the border areas of Qu and Sipanmo in the Fifth District was also launched in the same way.
