    Liberated from Suffering, Gaining Democracy and Freedom
    The People of Western Henan Welcome Our Army
    Liberated Chiang Soldiers Eager to Fight Back Home
    [Xinhua News Agency, Western Henan Front, 22nd] Special correspondent Mu Xin reports: The people of Central Plains, who have suffered from the four calamities of water, drought, the Yellow River, and Tang (Enbo), warmly welcome the liberating army. Before our army crossed the river, news had already spread secretly among the masses, telling each other. After our army crossed the river, the masses lined the streets to welcome us, preparing tea and noodle soup. An old woman named Yao from Shixiang Township, Xin'an County, said excitedly: "When the stubborn KMT fled this morning, the Bao trưởng and local bullies also ran away. Now that you've come, no one dares to bully us anymore." Especially in those areas that had been liberated and then re-occupied by Chiang Kai-shek's bandits, the people are now shedding tears of relief, reminiscing about the benefits of the Liberation Army, and cursing the crimes of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits. A woman surnamed Lü from Hengzhi said: "Last time I won a lawsuit in the democratic government, but as soon as you left, I lost my case. Now my grievances can be redressed." She grabbed a female comrade and told her about the suffering inflicted on her by the collusion between the local bullies and the Baojia trưởng, and couldn't help but shed tears. The masses stopped our army and cried about how Chiang Kai-shek's bandits had harmed members of the farmers' association in Zhuyuan. Along the way, many military dependents were waiting for their relatives at their doors. When a certain army arrived at a certain group, Comrade Xue Wenkui was discovered by his relatives and was immediately surrounded by men, women, old and young, asking all sorts of questions. An old gentleman of seventy-eight years old watched the scene of family reunion with envy; his child was originally in Chiang Kai-shek's army, and after being captured by us, he joined the Liberation Army. This time, even though he was only five miles away from the village, he didn't come home to see him. The old gentleman said: "Life in the army must be better than at home." When our vanguard liberated Xin'an, the thirty-five farmers imprisoned by Chiang Kai-shek's bandits for owing grain and corvée were overjoyed to hear that our army had arrived. The liberating army brought freedom and hope to the suffering compatriots in the Central Plains.

    [Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 21st] As the news of the victorious southern expedition of Liu, Deng, Xu, and Li's armies spread, Chiang Kai-shek's officers became even more panicked, while the soldiers hoped that the Liberation Army would liberate their hometowns as soon as possible. Li Jimou, the lieutenant station chief of the radio station of the 57th Division of the Chiang Kai-shek's reorganized army, who was liberated in the Shatuj Village, Luxi, told reporters: "The Central News Agency boasted every day that Liu Bocheng was encircled and annihilated and had no choice but to flee to the Dabie Mountains. The more it boasted, the more uneasy our (referring to Chiang Kai-shek's army) morale became. Because who doesn't know that Liu Bocheng went south only after winning several battles in southwestern Shandong? South of the Longhai Railway, our strength is weak, so we cannot stop him. Especially the senior officers, when they heard this news, were even more panicked and pessimistic, anticipating that Chiang's regime would collapse soon, and their high positions and generous salaries would not last long. Soldiers whose homes are in provinces such as Jiangxi, Hunan, and Sichuan, especially those who were formerly in the Soviet areas, are even more welcome to Liu Bocheng to cross the Yangtze River as soon as possible, so that they can get land. A newly liberated soldier from Hubei told reporters with great excitement: "I heard that the Eighth Route Army entered the Dabie Mountains, and I was so happy that I couldn't sleep half the night. Several of my fellow villagers said that we should quickly join the Eighth Route Army and fight back to our hometowns to get land."

    [Xinhua News Agency, Ji-Lu-Yu, 17th] More than two hundred officers of the Liberation Army of Guangdong and Guangxi origin, including Liu Chu and Liang Fuqian, former company commander of the 459th Regiment of the 153rd Brigade of the 63rd Division, and others from the Ji-Lu-Yu Military and Political University, were overjoyed to learn that the People's Liberation Army had launched a large-scale counter-offensive and that their hometowns would soon be liberated. They sent a telegram to the Two-Guangdong and Guangxi Column to congratulate them, stating: We vow to join your army after we graduate, liberate Guangdong and Guangxi, and atone for our crimes by doing meritorious service to repay the people.

    豫西人民欢迎我军
    被解放的蒋兵渴望打回老家
    【新华社豫西前线二十二日电】本社特派记者穆欣报导：饱受水、旱、黄、汤（恩伯）四灾的中原人民热烈的欢迎解放大军。在我军渡河前，群众中已暗传消息，奔走相告，我大军过河后，沿途群众夹道欢迎，准备了茶水、面汤。新安县属石乡镇的一位姓姚的老太太兴奋的说：“上午顽固逃时，保长恶霸也跟上跑了。你们一来，再没有人敢欺侮我们了。”特别在那些曾经解放而后又遭蒋匪侵占的地区，人民如今都流着欣慰的泪，追怀着解放军的好处，咒骂着蒋匪的罪恶。横峙的一吕姓妇女说：“上次我在民主政府打胜了官司，你们一走我的官司就输了，如今我的冤仇又能报了。”她拉住女同志诉说恶霸勾结保甲长给她的苦痛，不禁下泪，群众拦住我军哭诉蒋匪在竹园残害农会会员。一路上许多军属都倚门等待亲人，某军行至某组时，薛文魁同志被他的亲戚发现，立即被男女老幼围了起来，问长问短。旁边一位七十八岁的老先生羡慕的望着亲人团聚的情景；他的孩子原在蒋军中，被我俘虏后就参加了解放军，这次离村五里路都没有回家看看，老先生说：“队伍里一定比在家还好啊。”当我先头部队解放新安时，关在蒋匪狱中的三十五个欠粮欠丁的农民听到我大军来到，莫不欣喜若狂，解放大军给苦难中的中原同胞，带来了自由和希望。
    【新华社华东前线二十一日电】刘邓徐李大军胜利南征消息传播所及，蒋匪军官更加惶恐不安，士兵则盼望解放军早日解放他们的老家。此次鲁西沙土集被解放之蒋匪整编五十七师师部电台上尉台长李基谋对记者谈称：“中央社天天吹嘘刘伯承被围歼，不得已流窜大别山。它越吹得凶，我们（按指蒋匪军）军心就越不安。因为谁不知道刘伯承是在鲁西南打了好几次胜仗才往南去的。在陇海路以南，我们力量单薄，就无法阻挡。尤其是高级军官听到这些消息，更是惶惶不安，悲观万分，预感到蒋家天下快垮台了，自己的高官厚禄不会久长。家在江西、湖南、四川等省的士兵，特别是过去曾是苏区的，更欢迎刘伯承赶快打过长江去，好分得土地。一个刚获解放的湖北籍士兵眉飞色舞地告诉记者：“我听说八路军打进大别山，高兴得半夜没有睡着觉，我们几个同乡都说，我们赶快参加八路军打回老家去吧，好分田地。”
    【新华社冀鲁豫十七日电】冀鲁豫军官教导团粤、桂籍解放军官、原六三师一五三旅四五九团上尉连长刘楚、梁福谦等以下二百余人得悉人民解放军大举反攻，家乡解放有日，欣喜若狂，特致电两广纵队祝贺，内称：誓愿学成之日参加贵军，解放两广，将功折罪，以报人民。
