Short Commentary:

    The military and civilians in the border areas of the entire region, with the brave posture of a major counter-offensive, are conducting an intense and acute grain protection and harvesting struggle to trap the Chiang bandit troops on their "isolated islands." They have already achieved great victories. A new common characteristic demonstrated in the struggle is that everyone has seized the extremely favorable situation of a comprehensive victory in the counter-offensive and the wavering morale of the Chiang bandit army. They have fiercely attacked and advanced into the enemy's rear, taking the initiative to crush the bandit's rear order, thus achieving great victories with small forces. However, the Chiang bandits will inevitably make a desperate struggle. Therefore, the next stage of the struggle will be more tense and complex. It is even more necessary to implement this guiding ideology to strive for a comprehensive victory in the struggle. It is necessary to recognize the essential characteristics of the enemy's irremediable difficulties (few soldiers, lack of food, and popular opposition), to see through the enemy's paper tiger facade, and to make persistent efforts to trap it and starve it to death! The organization of enemy rear advances to protect the autumn harvest in Anyang and other places has created successful precedents. Their experience can be used as a reference and promoted in various places.

    An important aspect of the grain protection and harvesting struggle is to combine it with the masses' demands for unity, eliminating feudalism, and protecting (the distributed) land. The masses in the border areas of Pingyao and other places have realized from their own personal experience that: if you want to have a good autumn harvest, you must first eliminate treacherous bullies and bad elements. Therefore, the leadership must adopt a firm and clear policy, resolutely suppress the treacherous bullies and bad elements among the landlords, and combine the rush harvesting with the distribution of land and autumn crops. At the same time, in the grain protection struggle, attention should be paid to discovering and cultivating poor peasant backbones, in order to establish a strong leadership in the distribution of autumn crops and land, and to ensure the complete victory of grain protection and land distribution.

    再接再厉困死蒋军
    争取护粮斗争的全面胜利
    全区边地军民，正以大反攻的勇猛姿态，为困死“孤岛”的蒋匪军，而进行紧张、尖锐的护粮抢收斗争，且已获得很大胜利，斗争中表现出的一个新的共同的特点，是大家都抓紧了全面胜利反攻，蒋匪军心动摇这个极有利的形势，猛打猛冲，向敌后进军，主动打垮匪贼后方秩序，因而能以小兵力获大胜。但蒋匪必作垂死挣扎，故今后一段斗争，将更紧张复杂，就更必须贯澈这一领导思想，以争取斗争的全面胜利，就必须认识敌人的困难无法补救（兵少粮缺及群众反对），群众有急切的护粮要求（有的甚至已组织了自发的护粮斗争）等本质的特点，看穿敌人纸老虎的假威风，再接再厉，困死它，饿死它！安阳等地组织敌后进军保卫收秋已创造了成功的先例，他们的这一经验，可供在各地参考推行。
    护粮抢收斗争中的一个重要环节是要与群众的团结自己、消灭封建、保卫（分得）土地的要求相结合。平遥等地边地群众已从自己的切身体验中认识到：要想好好收秋，必先消灭奸霸坏蛋。因此领导上必须采取坚定明确的方针，坚决镇压地主中的奸霸坏蛋，结合抢收，开展分田分秋。同时在护粮斗争中，要注意发现与培养贫农骨干，以便树立分秋分田中的坚强领导，保证护粮与分田的完全胜利。
