　　Visiting the Handan Broadcasting Station
    Yi Ding
    Your reporter recently visited the Handan Broadcasting Station. The overall impression the station gave me was of vibrant energy and youthful spirit. This impression comes from the combination of their innovative creations and earnest work.

    I entered the broadcasting studio at a little after 7:00 PM, and it was broadcasting various programs from the Shaanbei Xinhua Broadcasting Station. Sky-blue electric lights illuminated the large room. The floor was covered with a patterned carpet, the ceiling was covered with pleated white homespun cloth, and the four walls were covered with grayish-white felt, a local product. These local products were used to construct soundproofing and echo-prevention equipment. The only furnishings in the room were a broadcasting table, a microphone, and a plush-cushioned chair, waiting for the broadcaster to arrive. Next door was the music broadcasting studio, which contained a piano and some percussion instruments. Another room housed the machinery, which was all finely crafted American equipment that had been "transported" to the Liberated Areas by the Chiang bandits. Today, they are working for the people in the Liberated Areas, together with the base area's felt, homespun cloth, and other materials, in the hands of the workers. In another transmitting room, the neon lights on the transmitter were flashing. After visiting the broadcasting studio and the machinery room, I went to visit the editorial department. They broadcast 15,000 characters of news and other reports every day. In addition to the Xinhua News Agency's telegrams, the sources of manuscripts also include the People's Daily, general and branch agencies, various district newspapers and periodicals, and letters from correspondents. In this regard, Comrade He Wei from the Taiyue Branch, and Comrades Zhang Peili and Liu Baorong from the Taihang PLA Officer Training Corps, Comrade Wang Haitao from the Jinnan PLA Officer Training Corps, Comrade Peng Chang from the Military Region Political Department, as well as newspaper correspondents from various organs and troops, have made great efforts for the radio station. They are now planning to improve the liaison organization and further develop communication work. From September 1st, they will strengthen the introduction of various constructions in this Liberated Area, such as urban construction, culture and education, production, support for the front line, and the new look of the countryside after land reform. According to them, they especially welcome typical reports of a city, a school, a company, a village, etc.

    In order to take care of the needs of Chiang's army officers and their families among the listeners, they broadcast the names of Chiang's army officers who laid down their weapons in Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu every day, as well as letters to relatives and friends. They are also preparing to introduce some articles by PLA officers and accusations against Chiang Kai-shek by Chiang's army officers, as well as life after laying down their weapons. Over the past year, the voice of the Handan Radio Station has spread to major cities in the Chiang-controlled areas. The people in the Chiang-controlled areas rely on it to obtain light and hope. In October of last year, the broadcast was temporarily suspended due to a machine failure. During the machine repair period, young people in Beiping sent letters asking when it would resume broadcasting as soon as possible. After the restoration, they requested to increase the time and increase the comments because, under Chiang Kai-shek's dark rule and deceptive propaganda, they could only find encouragement and comfort from our voices by the radio. In addition, Chiang's army officers also listen widely. A major source of knowing our various policies for Chiang's army officers who laid down their weapons is listening to the radio. Captain Liu Shanben of the Air Force and his air force friends who came to the Liberated Area one after another found a way out from the radio and resolutely turned to the Liberated Area. Domestically, all field army brigades and above in this area listen on time, and publish small newspapers based on the broadcast. Today, when the army is going deep into the Chiang area to fight, the radio station is even more important for the supply of spiritual food to them. Before Commander Liu went on the expedition, he earnestly warned the radio station personnel: "I hope you work hard to ensure that the troops hear your voices every day." The report on local work has also begun to play a certain role. For example, in April, the news of Liu Gaiying, a woman from Tunliu County in the Taiyue Liberated Area, joining the war on behalf of her husband, was broadcast. Tunliu's mimeograph publication "Rural Culture" published the incident under the title "Biography of Liu Gaiying Spreads Nationwide." This made Liu Gaiying herself more active, and local women also put forward the slogan of "Learning from Liu Gaiying." The comrades of the editorial department pointed out the future of the radio station in its development over the past year. They said that the service targets of this station mainly started with listeners in major cities in the Chiang-controlled areas and Chiang's army officers, but later, due to the needs of our army, the special broadcasting time for our army was increased from 7:00 to 8:30 PM on August 1st. From the Tunliu incident, we got another inspiration: If the technical conditions are quite adequate, using it to spread experience and promote work is the fastest and most effective way in today's inconvenient transportation situation. We hope to work together with all parties to create this condition and use this powerful tool for local work."

### 访问邯郸广播电台

　　访问邯郸广播电台
    一丁
    记者最近访问了邯郸广播电台、该台给我的整个印象是活力充沛而富有年青气概。这种印象，来自他们新颖的创造和严肃的工作的总和。
    走进播音室是下午七点多，正在转播着陕北新华广播电台的各种节目。天蓝色的电灯光照明了这宽大的房间，地上铺着织花地毯，天花板钉着皱折的白土布，四壁钉的是本地特产的灰白色毛毡，就用这些土产品构成了隔音和防止回声的设备。室内陈设只有一张播音桌，一架送话器，一把绒垫的椅子，静待播音者的到来。隔壁是音乐播音室，里面有一架钢琴，一部分打击乐器。另一间是机器间，这些机器都是精制的美国装备，而经过蒋贼“运输”到解放区来的。今天正和根据地的毛毡、土布等一同在解放区的工作者手中为人民服务。在另一间发射室里，发射机上的霓虹灯正在闪耀。参观了播音室与机器间之后，就去访问编辑部，他们每天播送一万五千字新闻和其他报导，稿源除新华社的电报外，就依靠人民日报、总分社、各区报纸、刊物和通讯员的函稿，在这一方面太岳分社的何微同志，太行解放军官教导团的张培礼、刘宝荣两同志，冀南解放军官教导团的王海涛同志，军区政治部彭长的同志，以及各机关部队的报纸通讯员，对电台都尽了很大的力。现在正计划着健全通联机构，更进一步的开展通讯工作，从九月一日以后，将要加强对本解放区各种建设的介绍，如城市建设、文化教育、生产、支援前线、土改后的农村新面貌等等，据他们说，特别欢迎一个城市、一个学校、一个公司、一个村等等的典型报导。
    为了照顾听众中蒋军军官及其家属的需要，他们每天播送着晋冀鲁豫放下武器的蒋军军官的名单和给亲友的家信。还准备介绍一些解放军官文章和蒋军军官对于蒋贼的控诉，与放下武器后的生活等。一年来邯郸电台的声音已传遍蒋管区各大城市，蒋管区人民依靠她得到光明和希望，去年十月因机器发生故障一度停播，在修理机器期间，北平青年纷纷来信询问，盼能早日恢复。及至恢复后，他们又要求增加时间，增加评论，因为他们在蒋介石的黑暗统治与欺骗宣传下，只有在收音机旁从我们的声音里才能找到鼓励与安慰。此外，蒋军军官也普遍收听。放下武器的蒋军军官之所以能知道我们各种政策，收听广播是一个主要来源。空军刘善本上尉及其以后陆续来解放区的空军朋友，都是从广播中找到出路，毅然投向解放区。对内说，本区野战军旅以上部队都按时收听，并根据广播出版小报。在大军深入蒋区作战的今天，电台对他们精神食粮的供给更有其重要意义，刘司令员出征前曾对电台人员谆谆告诫：“我希望你们好好工作，保障部队每天听到你们的声音”。对地方工作的报导，也开始起了一定的作用。比如：四月间曾广播太岳解放区屯留县妇女刘改英代夫参战的新闻，屯留的石印刊物“乡村文化”就把这件事登了出来，标题是“刘改英传名全国”。使得刘改英本人更加积极，当地妇女也提出了“学习刘改英”的口号。编辑部的同志们，就电台一年来发展，指出了它的前途。他们说，本台服务对象开始主要是蒋管区各大城市的听众及蒋军军官，但后来因本军的需要，所以又从八月一日增加了七时至八时半的专门对本军播音时间。从屯留这件事，又给我们一个启示：如果技术条件相当具备，利用它来传播经验推动工作，在今天交通不便情况下是最迅速而有效的。希望与各方面共同创造这个条件，把这有力工具用到地方工作上来。”
