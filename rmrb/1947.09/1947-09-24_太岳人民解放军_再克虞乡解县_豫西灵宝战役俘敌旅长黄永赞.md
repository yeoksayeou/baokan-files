    Taiyue People's Liberation Army
    Recaptures Yuxiang and Jiexian
    Lingbao Campaign in Western Henan Captures Enemy Brigade Commander Huang Yongzan
    [Xinhua News Agency, Jinji Luyu, 22nd] Late news: A unit of the Taiyue Liberation Army re-recaptured the two cities of Yuxiang and Jiexian on the 11th (Note: The two cities of Yuxiang and Jiexian were occupied by the Chiang bandits on the 6th of this month). The Chiang bandit troops defending the city fled back to Yuncheng. The Liberation Army besieging Linfen captured the Goose House stronghold 25 miles south of Linfen city on the 10th. On the 11th, the enemy's 30th Division in the city attacked south, attempting to recapture Goose House. They were severely attacked by our forces, who defeated them and pursued them all the way to Jiade Village, 15 miles south of Linfen city, annihilating the entire machine gun company of their 80th Regiment, killing and capturing over 220 enemy soldiers, including the Deputy Regiment Commander of the 89th Regiment, capturing one mortar, two 60mm guns, and nine light and heavy machine guns.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Western Henan Front, 22nd] On the 12th, in our Liberation Army's battle to annihilate the enemy's New First Brigade of the 76th Division in Lingbao, the brigade commander Huang Yongzan, who disguised himself and attempted to escape, has been captured by us. Huang Yongzan fled when the city fell, hiding with his guards in Quwo Village south of Lingbao, but was immediately captured by Zhang Laiwang, a 17-year-old militia member who participated in the battle, and the medic Sheng Zaitang. Huang put on an act, falsely claiming to be a "Sichuan opium merchant," attempting to deceive them. However, this imposter with a Zhejiang accent claiming to be "from Sichuan" quickly gave himself away. During questioning, he insisted on "playing dead," but was already pale with fear and trembling all over. The militia were about to escort him away when he immediately fell to his knees, begging for "mercy." Only after he learned that the captured Deputy Brigade Commander Hu Bingrui and others were safe did his expression become somewhat calmer. When he arrived at the prisoner concentration area, this brigade commander, who had been begging for mercy, actually put on airs again and displayed his disgusting arrogance upon seeing his colleagues who shared his fate. However, those subordinates no longer respected him, putting him in an extremely awkward situation. The people present couldn't help but laugh. That pathetic appearance was truly worthy of being a disciple of the Chiang bandit. Huang Yongzan is from Zhuji, Zhejiang, and a student of the third class of the Huangpu Military Academy.

    太岳人民解放军
    再克虞乡解县
    豫西灵宝战役俘敌旅长黄永赞
    【新华社晋冀鲁豫二十二日电】迟到消息：太岳解放军某部十一日再度收复虞乡、解县两城（按虞乡、解县两城系本月六日为蒋匪侵陷），守城蒋匪窜回运城。围困临汾之解放军十日攻克临汾城南廿五里之鹅舍据点，十一日城内敌三十师南犯，企图夺回鹅舍，遭我痛击，将敌击溃，并乘胜直追至临汾城南十五里之贾得村，将其八十团之机枪连全部歼灭，共毙俘敌八十九团副团长以下二百二十余名，缴迫击炮一门，六○小炮二门，轻重机枪九挺。
    【新华社豫西前线二十二日电】十二日我解放灵在歼敌七十六师新一旅战斗中，化装潜逃之该旅旅长黄永赞已被我俘获。黄永赞于城陷时潜逃，和他的卫士躲在灵南的曲沃村里，但立即就被十七岁的参战民兵张来望与卫生员盛再堂捉住了。黄氏装模作样的诡称是“四川烟客”，企图蒙混过去。但是这个满口浙江腔的“老家四川”乔装者，很快就露出了马脚。在盘诘时，他还一味要“死狗”，但是已经吓得面无人色，浑身发抖，民兵要把他解走。他立刻两腿瘫软的跪倒在地，口里连呼“饶命”。一直等到他得知被俘的副旅长胡秉锐等安在时，神情才比较安静下来。到了俘虏集中的某地时，这位曾经连呼饶命的旅长一见到与他同一命运的僚时，竟又装腔作势大摆其臭架子。但是那些僚属已经不卖他的帐，已至弄得窘态百出。在场的人不禁失笑，那一幅穷三相，不愧是蒋贼的门生。黄永赞是浙江诸暨人，黄埔三期学生。
