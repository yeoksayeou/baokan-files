Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 4th: TASS reports: Soviet international commentator Kudryavtsev published an article in "News" on the 2nd, titled "The Japanese Question in Sino-American Relations." The article stated: "In the past six months, certain changes have been detected in the US Far East policy. After the complete failure of the Marshall 'mediation' mission, American monopoly capitalists have begun to show clear signs of annoyance, because their investments in the 'China adventure' have not produced rapid and definite results, that is, have not obtained appropriate benefits. They expressed their disappointment through Marshall and later Wedemeyer, because the fact is that their money has disappeared into the flames of war or into the large pockets of corrupt Kuomintang leaders for several years. The feeling of greed makes them reconsider this again and turn their attention elsewhere. There is no official statement regarding the new trend in US Far East policy, because this would be detrimental to the prestige of the US among Chinese officials. However, it is no coincidence that the US Undersecretary of the Army and Secretary of Commerce Harriman made statements urging that Japan should be revived first, as they insisted that Japan is the 'industrial factory of East Asia.' Until July of this year, at least the Chinese (Chiang Kai-shek's) newspapers still pretended not to know the new trends in US policy. After making many promises and guarantees about Sino-American friendly relations, the United States is instead assisting the country that caused China decades of suffering, which is unbelievable, but that is indeed the case. The United States has openly stated that Japan should have priority over China in terms of economic revival. This attempt by the United States is mainly to turn Japan into a US 'subsidiary company' at the expense of China's economic and political interests. The United States did not wait for the conclusion of the peace treaty and unhesitatingly granted Japan loans of 400 to 500 million US dollars. American businessmen even consider this a good investment and are prepared to increase the loan to 600 million US dollars. Although Japan's revival initially appears in the form of expanding its East Asian trade, China's national interests bear the brunt of Japanese aggression, thus requiring that Japan's revival does not become a threat of military aggression against China. It is not without reason that the Chinese business community has risen up to oppose the US authorities' declaration to restore Japan's foreign trade before the conclusion of the peace treaty (i.e., from August 15th). However, American monopoly capitalists do not consider the national interests of China in this matter, but instead, under the guidance of the United States, enable Japan to expand trade to China. US loans and credit loans to Japan are transferring the 'American spirit' into the Japanese economy and helping to lay a solid foundation for it. It is foreseeable that Japan's future development will mainly take the form of expanding its foreign trade. The British Empire and the Australian market will obviously refuse the import of Japanese textiles, because this will cause a serious situation for Lancashire (British textile industry center) textile exports. Therefore, Japan's old market—China—will remain open, and American monopoly capitalists can also profit from the cheap dumping of Japanese textiles. In addition, in order to establish their dominance in East Asia, monopoly capitalists do not object to using Japan's old commercial relations. Naturally, this will be an irreparable blow to the Chinese textile industry, because the Chinese industry has not yet recovered after the war and is suffering from the chaos of the Chinese economy. The United States has not paid attention to the interests of its wartime allies, not only in the textile industry, but as is well known, the US government has repeatedly revised the Japanese reparations plan, and this unilateral action actually harms the interests of its allies (including China). US policy toward Japan has aroused increasing anxiety among the general public in China. The reason why the Kuomintang betrays Chinese interests to support US policy is because the Kuomintang reactionaries have to sacrifice national interests for their narrow class interests. In their anti-democratic struggle, they have become very dependent on the 'aid' of American reactionaries; therefore, they will not hesitate to sacrifice China's national independence and the people's interests. This situation is not only the case now, but will also be the same in the future."

　　独占资本在华赌博无结果
  　美加紧扶植日本财阀
    消息报论美远东政策新趋势
    【新华社陕北四日电】塔斯社讯：苏联国际评论家库得利亚赛夫，二日在消息报发表“中美关系中的日本问题”一文，该文称：“在过去半年内，美国远东政策发现了某些改变。马歇尔‘调停’使命完全失败后，美国独占资本家已开始表现明显的烦恼征象。因为他们在‘中国冒险事业’中的投资并未产生迅速与确实的结果，也就是未获得适当的利益。他们以马歇尔及后来的魏德迈为喉舌，发出失望的声音。因为事实是数年来他们的金钱已在炮火或在国民党腐败领袖们的大荷包里消失了。爱财的感觉使他们对此再三考虑，并将其注意力转向他方。美国关于远东政策的新趋势，并无正式声明；因为这将有害于美国在中国官方人士中的威信。然而恰在这个期间，美陆军部次长与商务部长哈立曼发表声明，敦促应首先复兴日本，这绝不是偶然的。如他们所坚称，日本是‘东亚的工业工厂’。到今年七月为止，至少中国（蒋家）报章仍伪装不知道美国政策的新趋势。在对中美友谊关系镊了许多诺言与保证之后，美国却反而援助使中国遭受数十年痛苦的国家，这是不能令人相信的事情，但事实确是如此。美国已公开谈论，在经济复兴方面，日本应比中国有优先权。美国此种企图，主要是在牺牲中国的经济政治利益下，把日本变为美国的‘辅助公司’。美国并未等候和约的缔结，便毫不犹豫的予日本以四亿到五亿美元贷款。美国商人甚至认为这是一种很好的投资，已准备将贷款提高到六亿美元。日本的复兴，在初期虽以扩展其东亚贸易的形势出现，但中国民族利益首当日本侵略之冲，因而要求日本复兴不致成为对华军事侵略之威胁。中国工商界起而反对美当局在缔结和约以前（即自八月十五起），恢复日本对外贸易的声明，当然不是没有理由的。然而美国独占资本家对此问题，并不顾及中国民族利益，反而在美国的指导下，使日本能向中国扩展贸易。美国给日本的贷款及信用贷款，在把‘美国精神’移入日本经济中，并协助其打稳基础。可以预见，日本将来的发展，主要是以扩展其对外贸易的形式出现。大英帝国与澳洲市场显然将拒绝日本纺织品的进口，因为这将使兰开夏（英国纺织业中心）纺织品出口遭遇严重局势。因此，日本的老市场——中国——仍将开放，而美国独占资本家也可以在日本纺织品廉价倾销中谋利。此外，独占资本家为建立他们在东亚的统治，也不反对利用日本商业上的旧关系。自然，这对中国纺织工业将是无可挽救的打击，因为中国工业在战后尚未恢复，并正受着中国经济混乱的影响。美国毫未注意其战时盟国的利益，这不仅在纺织工业一点上如此，如所周知，美政府已屡次修改日本赔偿计划，此种片面行动，实际上也损害其盟国（包括中国在内）的利益。美对日政策在中国一般人士中已引起日益增进的焦虑。国民党之所以出卖中国利益来拥护美国政策，是因为国民党反动派为其狭隘的阶级利益不得不牺牲国家民族利益。他们在反民主的挣扎中，已经十分依赖美国反动派的‘援助’；因此就不惜牺牲中国民族的独立与人民利益了。这种情形，不仅目前如此，今后亦将一样。”
