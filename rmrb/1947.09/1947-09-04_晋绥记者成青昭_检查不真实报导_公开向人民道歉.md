Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, 1st. The author of the untrue news story, "Female Guerrilla Captain Li Guifang," Cheng Qingzhao, recently published a review in the Jin-Sui Daily regarding his interview and writing process. He stated: Before the Sui-Bao Campaign, while heading north with the army, I injured my leg and was recuperating in a field hospital in Youyu County. There, I met a middle-aged woman who mentioned that she had previously served as a guerrilla captain in the Liangcheng, Helin, and Qingshuihe areas of Suiyuan. She was wounded and returned to the rear for recuperation. I found this material very novel, and the next day I talked to her in detail. She then talked about how she broke away from her feudal family to join the revolution, how she fought against Japanese spies to persist in her work, and how she ambushed the enemy, etc. I recorded what she said and read it back to her after writing it. She had no objections. At the time, I had personal thoughts of competing for merit and fame, fearing that others would find out about the material and go to interview her. Therefore, I did not think or investigate carefully, only paying attention to the advantages Li Guifang talked about. I did not discover from her behavior that she was "botching things up" and lying. After writing it, I did not give it to the county负责人 [fùzé rén, person in charge] to look at, nor did I think to do so. I also did not think that I should be honestly responsible to the Party newspaper, and consider for the newspaper editors that they are unable to investigate the facts in the稿子 [gǎozi, manuscript], and I sent it out triumphantly. Therefore, I should bear the main responsibility for this untrue report and apologize to the people.

  　检查不真实报导　公开向人民道歉
    【新华社晋绥一日电】被揭露的不真实新闻“女游击队长李桂芳”作者成青昭，顷在晋绥日报发表其采访此写作的检讨称：在绥包战役前随军北上途中，我因摔伤了腿在右玉县野战医院休养中遇到一位中年的妇女，她提到她过去曾在绥远之凉城、和林、清水河一带当过游击队长，因挂彩回后方休养。我觉得这材料很新颖，第二天又找她详谈，于是她就谈她如何摆脱封建家庭而参加革命，如何与日寇特务斗争坚持工作，如何伏击敌人等等，我把她说的记录下来，写好后曾念给她听过，她没意见，当时我怀着争功夺利的个人想法，深恐别人知道了材料去采访，因此就毫不加思索调查，只注意李桂芳谈的优点，没从她举止中发现她“拆烂污”说谎骗人，写好后没交给县上负责人看，也没有这样去想，也没有想到应老老实实向党报负责，替报纸编辑设想，他们是不能对稿子中的事实进行调查的，就洋洋得意的寄出去了。因此对这篇不真实的报导，我应负主要的责任，并向人民道歉。
