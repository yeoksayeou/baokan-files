    Mobile and Brave, Defending the Land Reform
    Li Fang Militia Team Wins Second Award
    [Our newspaper’s dispatch from Qixian] Since the county launched the "one hand with a gun, one hand for land distribution" campaign, Li Fang, an armed cadre of the Sixth District, led a small armed work team of 30 militiamen from several villages behind Beiling. On the night of September 4th, in heavy wind and rain, they rushed to the Shifosi area of the Third District to undertake the task of protecting the land reform and capturing landlords. They guarded the enemy at Shiheya. On the night of the 9th, a team from Junxian tried to sneak up on the militia sentries but were discovered and driven away. On the morning of the 10th, Comrade Li Fang heard gunfire in the Wei Xian and Hedong area, and he led the entire team to Jinzhuang. The enemy was trying to cross the river, so he ambushed the militia along the edge of Jinzhuang village. As soon as the enemy crossed the river, a volley of gunfire erupted, killing and wounding one enemy each. The enemy was scattered by the militia, and we chased them for seven li. In this battle, a total of three enemies, including a squad leader, were killed or wounded, and two were captured alive. We seized one Guangzao light machine gun and one rifle, with no casualties on our side. The County Command immediately issued a notice throughout the county commending them, and all team members were credited with a major merit, and collectively awarded 50 jin of grain and a towel each. This is their second award. During the protection of the wheat harvest, they, along with the cadres from the Third District, with just over 30 people, repelled an enemy grain-grabbing team of one battalion, and received an award from the county magistrate. Now, Li Fang's armed work team has become a model for the entire county. He is mobile and brave, and the militiamen are willing to be with him. The militiamen all say: "Follow Hei Li Fang, and do your work with confidence, you can't go wrong!" The assembly team nicknamed him "Black Tiger." (Ren Jie)
