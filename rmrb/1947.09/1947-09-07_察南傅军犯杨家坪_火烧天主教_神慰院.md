　　Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region, 5th: Fu Zuoyi massed approximately two divisions' worth of troops in Chahar South. These included the 35th Army's New 31st Division, part of the Provisional 3rd Army's Provisional 17th Division, and units of unidentified numbers. On August 25th, they launched an attack on Yangjiaping (under the jurisdiction of Zhuolu), located outside the Great Wall on the border of Hebei and Chahar, via three routes from Zhuolu and the areas south of it: Fanshanbao and Taohuabao. On the 29th, the Fu bandits scurried to Kongjian, located eight li from Yangjiaping. That evening, the bandits dispatched plainclothes teams who broke into Yangjiaping and set fire to the Catholic "Divine Consolation Home" ("Shen Wei Yuan"), which had a history of over 40 years. Fortunately, the People's Liberation Army bravely fought to extinguish the blaze, and only five rooms of the home were destroyed. On the morning of the 31st, under the cover of intense artillery fire, the Fu bandits sneaked into Yangjiaping, looted the home's property, and then burned the entire complex to the ground. The fire raged for a whole day, and the flames could be seen from dozens of li away. Yangjiaping is located 330 li west of Beiping. The "Divine Consolation Home," also known as the "Atonement Monastery," is one of only two such homes in China, built by foreign missionaries during the Eight-Nation Alliance. It is a large complex with over 300 Chinese and foreign priests and monks. Fu's bandits' attempt to burn the home before occupying the area clearly demonstrates a conspiracy to confuse the public in order to slander the military and civilians of the liberated areas.

　　察南傅军犯杨家坪
  　火烧天主教“神慰院”
    【新华社晋察冀五日电】傅作义集结其在察南之三十五军新三十一师，暂三军暂十七师一部及不明番号部队共约两师之众于八月二十五日自涿鹿及其以南之矾山堡、桃花堡三路出动，会犯冀察界上长城外之杨家坪（属涿鹿）。二十九日傅匪窜至距杨家坪八里之孔涧。当晚该匪竟派出便衣队，突入杨家坪纵火焚烧该地具有四十余年历史的天主教“神慰院”，幸经解放军奋勇扑救，仅焚毁该院房屋五间，三十一日晨，傅匪即在猛烈炮火掩护下窜入杨家坪，将该院财物抢掠一空，然后将该院全部烧毁，大火延烧竟日，数十里外均可望见火光。按杨家坪位于北平以西三百三十华里处，该地“神慰院”亦称“苦修院”，为中国仅有的两个神慰院之一，为八国联军时外国教士所建者。规模宏大，现有中外籍神父、修士三百余人。傅匪此次于攻占该地前企图焚毁该院，显为阴谋混淆视听，以便中伤解放区军民。
