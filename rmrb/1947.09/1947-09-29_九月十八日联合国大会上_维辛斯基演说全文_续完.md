September 18th Speech by Vyshinsky at the United Nations General Assembly
Continued

Who are the Warmongers?

This is where the propaganda for a new war is being cultivated in the United States, advocated not only by prominent representatives of powerful American industrial and military circles, powerful publications, and important politicians, but also by official representatives of the American government. Among them, the most enthusiastic promoters of a new war are those who have close ties to trade, industrial, and financial trusts, concerns, and monopolies. It is no accident that I do not need to name them all; it is enough to name a few. Of course, this is not about their personal opinions or qualities, but mainly about those social groups, institutions, and industrial, technical, and scientific organizations, because these people represent the will and interests of these groups.

First, on May 17, during the U.S. House of Representatives' discussion of the proposal to allocate funds to "aid" the governments of Greece and Turkey, Congressman Dorn made a shameless statement that could be described as that of an obstinate warmonger. He said that $400 million cannot subdue the Soviet Union, but only by means of a powerful air force, bombing the Soviet Union's potential industrial areas, the Ural industrial zone, and other vital areas, can the Soviet Union be subdued.

Second, the chairman of the National Association of Manufacturers, Jorden, slandered the Soviet Union. According to this arrogant man, the United States should produce a large number of atomic bombs and use them quickly, regardless of whether there is reason to believe that a certain country is producing such armaments.

Third, former U.S. Ambassador to Bulgaria, Earl, made a provocative statement before the House "Committee on Un-American Activities," saying that the United States must immediately use atomic bombs against countries that refuse to accept the U.S. proposed supervision plan. He threatened his audience with the Soviet Union's "submarine-launched jet bombs," insisted on secretly expanding the most terrible weapons, and insisted on notifying the Soviet Union that when the first atomic bomb fell on American soil, the United States would destroy every village in the Soviet Union. He insisted on using atomic bombs against the Soviet Union.

Fourth, Congressman Eaton, Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, wrote in "The American" magazine, "We can still resist the Soviet Union psychologically now. If not, we should crush it by force."

Fifth, Senator McMahon, Chairman of the U.S. Congressional Atomic Energy Joint Committee, declared in Congress that if an atomic war is inevitable, the United States should strike first and drop atomic bombs. In another speech, he said that if an agreement on international control of atomic energy cannot be reached, the United States has four possibilities to choose from: 1. Store a large number of atomic bombs; 2. Launch a war immediately; 3. Establish an international control agency aside from the Soviet Union; 4. Determine the effective date of international control and declare that countries that do not obey the control will be guilty of aggression.

Sixth, Illinois Senator Brooks shamelessly declared in the Senate on March 12 this year that if the United States had heeded the advice of the Republican Party before the war and allowed Germany to destroy Russia, then Truman's plan would not be necessary. He also said that the United States helped the Soviet Union during the war, and now the United States may be forced to fight the Soviet Union.

Seventh, General Dean, former head of the U.S. military mission to the Soviet Union, said in his book that the United States should plan to engage in combat plans to deal with special situations that may arise in the event of war with the Soviet Union.

Eighth, according to reports, Harwood, chairman of the U.S. Cutler-Hammer Industrial Corporation, said that atomic bombs are useless weapons because they destroy a very large amount of property, not just human bodies. This same Harwood shamelessly declared at a meeting of the American Experts Association in Milwaukee that although it may seem cruel, if we must have war, then the standard weapon we must possess is a weapon that only kills human lives. In future wars, the use of such weapons can eliminate the need for large-scale restoration of countries and property at great expense.

Ninth, Dulles gave a speech in Chicago on February 10 this year, urging a tough diplomatic approach to the Soviet Union. He asserted that if the United States abandons this approach and hopes for the possibility of reaching some kind of compromise with the Soviet Union, then war is inevitable. In the same speech, he boasted that since the fall of the Roman Empire, no country has possessed as much material superiority as the United States. He urged the United States to use this advantage to achieve its goals.

The significance of these speeches is obvious, that is, to promote anti-Soviet war, either explicitly or implicitly. This is a provocative attempt to divert people's attention from the real warmongers, and with the deceptive slander of so-called "worldwide social revolution"; and they calculate that the audience is stupid and will easily believe their kind of crazy talk, in order to cover up their instigating and provocative activities.

New War Drummers - The American Publishing Industry

If the environment requires it, we can also talk about the situation of the American press and publishing industry conducting propaganda for a new war. Many reactionary American newspapers are controlled by news giants such as Morgan, Rockefeller, Ford, Hearst, and McCormick, who are also not behind the reactionary politicians who incite war. Morgan controls magazines such as "Time," "Life," and "Fortune," which are published by the well-known "Time Publishing Company," and among the largest shareholders are "Brown Brothers Harriman & Co." As everyone knows, the largest capitalists in the United States are also the owners of a large number of publications. They control many magazines, newspapers, and news releases, and have their own publishing agencies to penetrate the book market with printed materials. All these publications follow the will of their bosses, vigorously carry out propaganda for launching a new war, and in this spirit, do everything possible to fabricate and distort false statements, with the intention of inciting hatred against the Soviet Union and other new democratic countries in Eastern Europe. The pages of these newspapers and magazines are filled day and night with provocative calls, demanding attacks on other countries, insisting that these countries endanger American security; although these newspapers and magazines and their owners know that no one intends to attack the United States. The United States has no danger in this regard. As an example, it is easy to cite examples, such as the New York Herald Tribune and other similar publications that mainly belong to the Hearst system, systematically publishing all possible provocative articles, instilling in their readers the impression that "if Europe collapses or falls under the control of the Soviet Union, military action will be necessary." There are indeed quite a few such remarks. But the main thing that should be pointed out is not that there are such remarks, but that these remarks have not encountered proper refutation, which further encourages them to engage in increasingly provocative activities. All these newspapers are completely controlled by the owners of the newspaper companies and, according to instructions, use their words as expressions of public opinion, pretending to be the mouthpiece of the American people's feelings, thoughts, and desires. However, it can be confidently said that the American people, like the people of other democratic countries, are opposed to suffering the pain of a new war when the old war wounds on their bodies have not yet healed. However, in most cases, people have no possibility of stating their needs and desires in millions of books and magazines. Naturally, this situation facilitates the propagandists and instigators of new wars, who use their advantageous position to harm the interests of peace-loving people. At the same time, a few words should be said about the new war propaganda carried out by various scientific institutions and universities. This point can be mentioned in the recently published collection of papers by Naru University entitled "Supreme Weapon," in which a group of learned authors, when discussing atomic weapons and the use of controlling atomic energy, came to the conclusion: "The most effective way to prevent a new war at present is to truly have the ability to launch an atomic war immediately upon receiving notification." The book describes various atomic wars under the guise of scientific objectivity, and states that if the U.S. Air Force "can start using bases in northern Canada, the distance to Soviet cities will be greatly shortened." Thus, "this can use our bases to destroy a large number of large cities in any other major power." In this so-called "Supreme Weapon" (atomic bomb) book, a group of American authors deliberately ambiguously stated: "If we (meaning the Americans) cannot eliminate the threat by pre-emptive strikes before the threat is realized, (that is, to do something that our constitution explicitly prohibits), then we are destined to be destroyed by atomic attacks..." This book, under the guise of various "scientific" discussions, talks about the dangers of "unilateral action by one or another major power," and claims that any "unilateral action" in the future is more likely to come from the Soviet Union. This argument leads to this provocative conclusion: "The serious danger facing the United States is that on a clear day, the Soviet Union may launch a sudden war against us (meaning the United States) without warning." The above excerpts from the book are enough to illustrate how mottled the ways and methods of American propaganda for a new war against the Soviet Union are.

The propaganda for a new war is accompanied by demands for the production of the most brutal weapons. What extent has this propaganda reached? This can be judged from a report published in the "Chemical & Engineering News" magazine, which openly promotes all the convenient and murderous benefits of germ warfare in a chapter entitled "Science and Civilization." An article in "Army Ordnance" magazine on new toxins is also promoting germ warfare. According to the magazine, 50 million yuan has been spent to study this new toxin. In the words of the author of the article, this expenditure is completely worthwhile because one ounce of the new toxin is enough to kill 180 million people. Anyone who talks about this kind of so-called "scientific literature" will recognize how despicable the activities that the instigators and propagandists of new wars are developing in order to form an atmosphere that shocks the minds of the people with war cries.

Anti-Soviet Propaganda by American Warlords

The psychological state caused by this propaganda spread by reactionaries around the world among social figures, and especially felt in the American sphere of influence, can be proved by the article published by British journalist Vernon Bartlett in the London News Chronicle in early August this year. This article has the following very meaningful lines: "A person, upon arriving in the area under the rule of MacArthur's headquarters, found himself on Okinawa; on his way to Japan, he was deeply shocked by the tone of the American newspapers' use of the Soviet Union. American soldiers cannot be blamed for concluding that the war against the Soviet Union is only a matter of months after reading these newspapers. If the Japanese do not pay attention to this almost hysterical psychological state, they are probably fools." This report is as important as the report in Newsweek, which published an article by its diplomatic editor, Cluen, who recently returned from Japan. Cluen said: American generals in Japan are systematically inducing Japanese soldiers to believe in the urgency and necessity of an anti-Soviet war. Cluen reported that a number of Japanese "kamikaze" pilots have arrived in the American model, claiming that they are prepared to participate in the new anti-Soviet war they have heard has already begun. Cluen pointed out: "The Japanese may welcome the possibility of fighting the Soviet Union, and the Japanese army, maintained and supplied by the United States, may be dispatched... The U.S. Marine Corps will land in almost any possible place, while Japan will enjoy security under the protection of American superior air and naval forces. These threatening and important facts explain why the peace conference with Japan without Soviet participation is considered insignificant." From this, it can be seen that the United States has been systematically conducting war propaganda for a long time. The main directions of this propaganda are as follows: (1) Fear the Soviet Union as a powerful country, which is said to aim to dominate the world and prepare to attack the United States, and do everything possible to use various slanders, fabrications, provocative anti-Soviet scolding propaganda, and repeatedly express fear of the Soviet Union. (2) Openly promote increased armaments, further improvements in large numbers of weapons, with no intention of limiting them, let alone prohibiting the use of atomic weapons. (3) Openly call for an immediate attack on the Soviet Union, while carrying out provocative attempts, on the one hand, saying that the Soviet Union's military power is strong to intimidate people, and on the other hand, according to the war instigators, the Soviet Union is weak militarily after World War II and has not fully recovered, so persuade everyone of the necessity of taking advantage of the current situation. (4) The war psychology stirred up and instigated by the American warlords and expansionists is maintained in American society by all possible means.

American Progressive People Oppose War Propaganda

The progressive people of the United States see this and make various efforts to expose the war preparations currently being carried out in the United States and to sober up those who harbor war madness. These American progressives and some progressive newspapers exposed the war preparations being carried out in the United States due to the instigation of military groups and various reactionary groups. For example, Kimdon, chairman of the "American Progressive Citizens Association," wrote in the New York Times on this issue: The center of all this propaganda is the high-ranking militaristic-minded officials of the Army and Navy Department, the members of the House and Senate who listen respectfully to the clamor for war, the leaders of monopoly enterprises, and representatives of certain churches. Kimdon went on to say: The military hopes to create some kind of incident as an excuse to drop atomic bombs. The American "Mercury" magazine, in its February issue this year, analyzed the plans prepared by the U.S. Army for World War III, and this article said: "Industrial preparations are the key to all current government plans in Washington, where the possibility of World War III has been taken into account." Because this conclusion was made by the American military authorities such as Patterson, Royal, and other army leaders, this article has special significance. What is said above fully proves that the main instigators of propaganda and incitement of new wars are the reactionary groups in the United States. They only pursue selfish interests and are prepared to plunge humanity into a world war that devastates humanity for these interests. The American reactionaries are not isolated in these activities, they are supported by their followers in other countries, who are busy forming military and political, or just political, Western, Northern, or other groups.

Warmongers in American Political Circles

Here, mention should be made of certain speeches by British politicians, who are indeed not as resolute as their American partners, but act silently, but their alarmed spirit is the same. Everyone remembers Churchill's Fulton speech, where he mentioned "the overall strategic ideology," as Marshal Stalin said in his important conversation, this British former prime minister did "dangerous activities, intending to sow seeds of discord among the allies and hinder their cooperation." Marshal Stalin emphasized at this point that "Mr. Churchill's line is the line of war, calling for an anti-Soviet war." We all remember that Churchill opposed the United Nations organization as a union of various language nationalities, but only as a union of English-speaking nationalities, which imitated Hitler's example. Hitler started to launch a war by declaring racial theories as a method, declaring: "Only the German people are an excellent nation." We also remember other points in the Fulton speech, with which Churchill carried out incitement and anti-Soviet slander. Little Churchill, as an echo of Old Churchill, broke the record of war mongers with a statement made in Sydney on September 3. The Churchill family's remarks themselves are only of interest to a few people, but because they are a sign of the despicable deeds that some British people are carrying out, they are opposed to the cause of peace and are directly moving towards organizing a new war, whether it is repeating the form of the infamous Churchill's invasion of the Soviet Union, or any other form. Therefore, it should also be mentioned that the Anglo-American Joint Chiefs of Staff are still continuing to perform their duties in Washington. As is well known, the British representative in this Joint Chiefs of Staff is a military delegation led by General Morgan, and the American representative is a military delegation led by Admiral Leahy. This Joint Chiefs of Staff, which was established to unify military operations against Germany and Japan, still exists even though the war ended two years ago, and no one knows its purpose!

Provocative Clamors of Turkish and Greek Reactionary Newspapers

There is no need to list the many facts in this regard about the inexcusable and unrestrained lies and provocations that have been carried out in Turkey for a long time, and the propaganda inciting an anti-Soviet war. Turkish reactionary newspapers are trying to keep pace with American reactionary newspapers; there is a Russian proverb that describes this situation: "The horse runs in front, the lobster follows behind, the horse has hooves, the lobster only has two pliers" (according to this Russian idiom, it is similar to the Chinese saying "the fox borrows the tiger's power"). Turkish newspapers spread anti-Soviet slanders every day, saying "the Soviet Union plans to occupy Turkey" (the "Bashan" newspaper), provocative predictions that "the allied countries will strike the Soviet Union from the Turkish coast" (the "Democracy" newspaper). The Turkish press incites the Turkish people to prepare for war, while exaggerating American power, asserting that it is inevitable to participate in an anti-Soviet war. An article published by the infamous "Canhumin" newspaper by a man named Davel shamelessly and explicitly declared that war is "the only way to get Moscow on the right track"; the "Ulus" newspaper expressed its agreement, and the deputy editor said: "The time has matured for the United States and Britain to take further decisive action." Yalsin, the editor of the "Tan" newspaper, which is notorious for provocative activities, also followed suit. Last September, he wrote: "The time has come to invite the Soviet Union to hold frank talks at a conference table with atomic bombs hanging over its head." He demanded that the Soviet Union be issued an ultimatum and declared: "If they do not agree to establish a new international order, atomic bombs will fall on their heads." This Yalsin recently wrote that an ultimatum is the only language to talk to Moscow and demanded that "the world be united against the Soviet Union." Some writers also expressed similar provocative opinions, such as Ediz, a writer for the Turkish reactionary newspaper "Ergenekon," Professor Netlin, a member of the Congressional Foreign Affairs Committee, and so on. These provocative clamors are strongly supported by the Greek reactionary newspapers, especially the "Elikon Ima" newspaper, which recently published an article saying: "Tell the Soviet Union not to forget that the Soviet Union's main oil source in Baku is only within 100 kilometers, very close at hand." And all this is carried out publicly under the public eye without being condemned. These are the conspiracies of the enemies of peace, inciting new wars for their own selfish interests, attempting to profit from new wars that bring new disasters and misfortunes to humanity. This movement to incite new wars will undoubtedly be severely and resolutely condemned by millions of people.

Soviet Proposals to Ban Propaganda for New Wars and Implement Disarmament Decisions

The Soviet government believes that the conscience of all nationalities in the world cannot tolerate this situation. They shouldered the entire burden of the Second World War not long ago, and paid with their blood for the suffering and destruction inflicted by the war on peace-loving people. The Soviet delegation, on behalf of the Soviet government, declares that the Soviet Union believes that the urgent task of the United Nations organization is to take measures to ban the propaganda for new wars that is currently being carried out in some countries, especially in the United States. Therefore, the Soviet delegation requests the adoption of the following recommendations:

(1) The United Nations organization should condemn the criminal propaganda for new wars carried out by reactionaries in some countries, especially in the United States, Turkey, and Greece; they openly demand attacks on peace-loving democratic countries through newspapers, radio, movies, and public speeches, spreading various fabrications and lies to carry out this propaganda.

(2) The United Nations organization should consider that allowing (not to mention supporting) this propaganda for new wars, which will inevitably lead to a third world war, is a violation of the obligations of the member states of the United Nations. The charter requires "developing friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples, and taking other appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace," rather than endangering international peace, security, and justice. (Article 11, Paragraph 2 of the Charter)

(3) The United Nations organization should consider it necessary to urge the governments of all member states to prohibit propaganda for new wars in any form, and to punish those who violate it. And take measures to prevent and stop war propaganda, because this harms society and threatens the vital interests and welfare of peace-loving humanity.

(4) The United Nations organization should reaffirm the need to implement the General Assembly's decision on reducing armaments on December 14, 1946, and the General Assembly's decision on January 24, 1946, on prohibiting countries from using atomic weapons and other armaments that massively destroy humanity as soon as possible. And the United Nations organization should consider that implementing these resolutions is in the interests of all peace-loving humanity and constitutes the most violent blow to propagandists and instigators of new wars.

Comrade Stalin said in his congratulatory message to Moscow: Moscow is the pioneer in striving for lasting peace and friendship among all nations in the world, and the pioneer in opposing the instigators of new wars. These words of the leader of the Soviet people have gained a deep response in the hearts of all loyal and progressive people around the world. The Soviet Union is determined to spare no effort to strive for the victorious completion of this great task. (End of full text. The subtitles were created by the New China News Agency editor)

    九月十八日联合国大会上
    维辛斯基演说全文  续完
    谁是战争贩子？
    这就是在美国培育新战争宣传的地方，这种宣传的倡导者不但是有势力的美国工业界军界的著名代表，不但是有势力的出版物和重要政客，而且也是美国政府的官方代表。在他们当中，新战争的特别热烈鼓吹者是那些贸易工业及财政托辣斯、康采伦及独占资本有密切联系的人物，这并非偶然的事。我认为没有必要一一指明他们，只要举出一些来就够了，这当然不是谈论他们个人，他们个人的意见和个人的品质等等，而主要的是谈论那些社会集团、机构及工业技术与科学团体，因为这些人正是代表这些团体的意志与利益的。
    第一、五月十七日美众院讨论拨款“援助”希、土政府的建议时，众议员多恩发表堪称为顽固的战争贩子的无耻声明，他说：四亿美元不能驾驭苏联，而只有借助于强大的空军，及轰炸苏联潜在的工业地区和乌拉尔工业区及其他生命攸关的地区，才能制服苏联。
    第二、全国工业会议主席约尔登曾诽谤苏联；按这位骄横的人所谈，美国应当生产大量原子弹，并迅速使用，不管是否有根据相信某国正在生产这种军备。
    第三、前美驻保加利亚公使亚尔在众院“反美活动调查委员会”上发表挑拨性的声明说：美国须立即使用原子弹对付拒绝接受美国所提监督计划的国家。他以苏联的“潜水艇施放喷射炸弹”恫吓其听众，坚主秘密扩展最可怖的武器，并坚主通知苏联：当第一颗原子弹投落在美国境内的时候，则美国将摧毁苏联的每一个村庄。他坚主用原子弹对付苏联。
    第四、美众院外委会主席伊顿在“美国人”杂志著文称：“我们现在还能在心理上抵抗苏联，假如不行，我们应以武力粉碎它。”
    第五、美国会原子能联合委员会主席参议员麦克马洪在国会上宣称：如果原子战争不可避免，则美国应先下手投掷原子弹。他在另一次演说中说：如果不能获致国际共管原子能的协议，则美国有四种可能性可以撰择：一、存储大量原子弹；二、立即发动战争；三、撇开苏联设立国际管制机构；四、确定国际管制生效日期，并宣布不服从管制的国家即犯侵略之罪。
    第六、伊里诺斯州参议员布鲁克本年三月十二日在参院演说中毫不知耻的宣称：假如美国当初注意共和党战前所作的劝告，并容许德国去摧毁俄罗斯的话，那么，目前杜鲁门的计划就没有必要了。他又说：战时美国帮助苏联，而现在美国可能被迫与苏联作战。
    第七、前美国驻苏军事使团团长第安将军在其所著一书中称：美国应筹划从事作战计划，以对付一旦与苏联作战所可能造成的特别情势。
    第八、据报载：美国科特勒汉姆工业股份公司董事长哈伍德称：原子弹是没有什么用处的武器，因为它摧毁极大量的财产，而不是仅仅消灭人类的躯体。就是这位哈伍德在密尔窝基的美国专家协会会议上无耻地声称：虽然说来似乎残酷，但假如我们必须战争，那么我们所必须拥有的标准武器，就是只杀戮人类生灵的武器。在未来战争中，使用这种武器可以免除以浩大的费用大规模复兴国家与财产的必要。
    第九、本年二月十日杜勒斯曾在芝加哥发表演说，敦促对苏采取强硬的外交方针。他断言：如果美国放弃这种方针，并指望与苏联有达成某种妥协的可能性，则战争当不可避免。他在同一演说中大吹法螺，说自从罗马帝国覆亡以来，再没有一个国家象美国一样握有大量物质上的优势。他敦促美国利用此种优势而达到它的目的。
    这些演讲的意义是明显的，就是或暗或明地鼓吹反苏战争。这是一种挑拨的企图，意图使人们不注意真正的战争贩子，和以所谓“全世界社会革命”的欺骗毁谤；并且他们盘算听众是蠢笨的，会轻易相信他们这一类狂言呓语，这样来掩饰他们煽惑挑唆的活动。
  新战争吹鼓手——美出版界
    如果环境需要，还可以谈一谈进行新战争宣传的美国报界出版界情形。许多的美国反动报纸都掌握在摩根、洛克菲勒、福特、赫斯特、麦考米克等新闻巨头手中，他们亦并不落于煽动战争的反动政客之后。摩根控制着“时代”“生活”“幸福”等杂志，其出版者为著名的“时代出版公司”，且最大的股票持有人中有“布朗兄弟哈里曼公司”等。如所周知，美国最大的资本家也就是大量出版物的所有者，他们控制了许多杂志、报纸、新闻稿，拥有自己的出版机关，以文字印刷品侵入书报市场。所有这一切出版物都秉承其老板的意旨，猛力进行发动新战争的宣传，并以此种精神尽一切可能捏造歪曲虚构的言论，存心想达到煽起憎恨苏联及其他东欧新民主国家的目的。这些报纸杂志的篇幅上日以继夜的满载着挑拨性的呼叫，要求进攻其他国家，硬说这些国家危害美国的安全；虽然这些报章杂志及其主人明知没有人打算进攻美国。美国在这方面并没有什么危险。作为一个例证，人们不难举出例子，如象纽约先驱论坛报及其他类似的主要是属赫斯特系的出版物，有系统的刊载一切可能的挑拨文章，对其读者灌注“若欧洲一旦崩溃或陷于苏联控制之下，则军事行动将有必要”的印象。这一类的言论实在为数不少。但是应该指出的主要事情，不在于有这类的言论一点，而是在于这类言论并未遇到正当的驳斥，这便更加鼓励他们从事日新月异的挑拨。所有这些报纸都完全控制在各报业公司的主人手中，并遵照嘱咐将其文字运用当作舆论的表现，装作是表现美国人民感情、思想、愿望的喉舌。然而可以泰然的说，美国人民一如其他民主国家人民一样，是反对在身上旧的战争创痛未愈之时，再受新战争的创痛的。然而在大多数场合，人民没有可能在出版数百万册的书报杂志中申说他们的需要与愿望。自然，这种情形便利了新战争的宣传者与煽动者，他们利用自己有利的地位损害爱好和平人民的利益。同时应该对各科学机关与大学所进行的新战争宣传说几句话，这一点可以提到最近那鲁大学出版的以“无上武器”为名的论文集，其中一群博学的作者于谈论原子武器与控制原子能之使用时，竟至得出这种结论：“现有的阻止新战争的最有效方法即是真正在一接获通知立即有发动原子战争的能力。”该书在科学的客观态度的假面具下描述各种不同的原子战争，并谓，假若美国空军“能开始利用加拿大北部的基地，则与苏联城市的距离将大为缩短。”从而“这就能利用我们的基地摧毁其他任何一强国的大批大城市。”在这本所谓“无上武器”（原子弹）书中，一群美国作者故意暧昧的说：“假若我们（即指美国人）将来不能在威胁尚未实现之前先发制人的打击而消灭威胁，（这就是说要干一下我国宪法所确切禁止的事情），则我们是被注定毁灭于原子的进攻之下……。”这本在各种“科学”讨论的掩饰下的书籍说到“此一或彼一大国片面行动”的危险，并称将来若发生任何“片面行动”，则较可能是来自苏联。这种论点得出这样挑拨性的结论：“美国面对着的严重危险在于在某一个晴朗的日子，苏联可能毫无警告的突然发动对我们（指美国）的战争。”上面摘引的该书片断已足够说明美国宣传首先对苏的新战争的方式与方法是如何斑驳陆离。
    新战争的宣传伴随着生产最凶残的武器的要求，这种宣传已经到了什么地步，这从“化学与工程新闻”杂志上刊载的一项报告就可以判断，这报告在名为“科学与文明”的一章中竟公开宣传细菌战争的一切便利杀人的好处。“陆军兵器”杂志中一篇关于新毒素的论文也同样是宣传细菌战争的，据该杂志称，为研究此种新毒素已花费了五千万元。用该文作者的话来说，这笔花费是完全值得的，因为一盎斯新毒素即足可杀死一亿八千万人。谈到这类所谓“科学文献”的人都会认清，新战争的煽动者与宣传者为了形成以战争的狂喊震惊人民的心魂的气氛，而在发展着多么卑污的活动。
    美国军阀的反苏宣传
    由反动派在全世界散播的这种宣传，在社会人士中所造成的，并特别清楚地在美国的势力范围内所感到的心理状态，可由英国记者维尔农巴·尔莱特今年八月初在伦敦新闻纪事报上发表的论文所证明。这一论文有下述很有意味的这么几行：“有一个人在一到达麦克阿瑟指挥部统治底下的区域时，发现自己是在冲绳岛上；在他去日本路上时，就深为美国报纸上对苏联用语的腔调所震惊。美国士兵在读过这些报纸后便得出对苏战争只是几个月内的问题之结论，是不能怪他的。假如日本人不注意这种近乎歇斯底里的心理状态，他们恐怕是傻子。”这一报导与新闻周刊之报导同等重要，该刊发表了其新近自日本归来的外交编辑克伦的论文。克伦说：在日本的美国将军们正有计划诱导日本军人，使他们相信反苏战争的迫切和必要性。克伦报导说：好些日本的“神风”飞行员到了美国机型，宣称他们准备参加他们听说已经开始了的新的反苏战争。克伦指出：“日本人或将欢迎对苏作战的可能性，而且由美国维持供给的日本陆军或将出动……美海军陆战队将在几乎任何可能的地方登陆，同时日本将在美国优越的空海军保护下享受到安全。这些具有威胁性的重要事实，说明了为什么对日和会没有苏联参加是被认为毫不在乎的。”由此可见，美国有系统地进行战争宣传，好久以来早已如此了。这种宣传的主要方向如下：（一）恐惧苏联为一有力的强国，据说它的目的在于统治世界并准备进攻美国，尽一切可能用各种毁谤的捏造以及挑拨性的反苏谩骂宣传和反复申说对苏联的恐惧。（二）公开宣传增加军备，进一步的改进大批武器，而丝毫无意于限制，更不要说禁止原子武器的使用。（三）公开召号立即进攻苏联，同时进行挑拨性的企图，一方面说苏联的军事力量强大以恐吓人，另一方面按战争挑拨者的意见，在第二次世界大战后，苏联在军事方面是衰弱的，还没有完全恢复，因此要说服大家利用目前情势的必要性。（四）由美国的军阀和扩张主义分子所鼓动和煽起的战争心理，以一切可能的方法保持在美国社会中。
  美国进步人民反对战争宣传
    美国的进步人民看到这点，并以各种努力来揭发现在美国所进行的战争准备，和使怀有战争狂的人头脑清醒过来。这些美国的进步人士与部分进步报纸，揭发了由于军事团体和各种反动团体的鼓动正在美国进行着的战争准备。例如：“美国进步公民协会”主席金登在纽约时报对此问题写道：这一切宣传的中心，便是陆海军部踞于高位的具有军国主义头脑的官员，对战争的叫嚣恭谨聆听的众参两院议员和独占企业领袖以及某些教会方面的代表。金登继称：军界希望能制造某种事件作为借口投掷原子弹。美国“水星”杂志在今年二月份的一期中分析美国陆军方面为第三次世界大战而准备的计划，这论文说：“工业上的准备是目前政府在华盛顿的一切计划的关键，在那里，已经考虑到第三次世界大战的可能性了。”因为这个结论是美国军事当局如柏德逊、罗雅尔及其他陆军领袖作出的，因此这篇论文便具有了特别的意义。上面所说，完全证明了，宣传和挑拨新战争的主要的煽动者乃是美国的反动集团。他们只追求自私的利益，并准备为了这些利益而把人类投入蹂躏人类的世界战争之中。美国反动派在这些活动当中并不是孤立的，他们受着他们在其他国家的追随者的拥护，这些追随者正忙于组成军事与政治或仅只是政治的西方、北方或其他的集团。
    美国政界中的战争贩子
    在这里应当提及英国政界人士的某些演说，这些人士的确不象他们的美国伙伴那样说得坚决，而只是默默地行动，但其惊惶的精神是一样的。每个人都记得邱吉尔、富尔顿演说，在那里，他提到过“总的战略思想”，正如斯大林大元帅在其重要谈话中所说的，这位英国前首相干的“危险的活动，打算在盟国间散布不和的种子，并妨碍他们的合作”。这一点上斯大林大元帅着重指出过，“邱吉尔先生的路线是战争的路线，号召反苏战争”。我们都记得，邱吉尔反对联合国组织为各种不同语言的民族之联合，而只是英语民族的联合，这是仿效希特勒的榜样。希特勒开始发动战争就是以宣布种族理论为方法，宣称：“仅有德语人民才是优秀民族”。我们也记得富尔顿演说中其他各点，邱吉尔即凭着这以进行煽动和反苏污蔑。小邱吉尔作为老邱吉尔的应声虫，于九月三日在悉尼发表声明，打破了战争贩子的纪录。邱吉尔家族的发言本身只使少数人感到兴趣，但是因为它们是某些英国人士正进行着的卑劣勾当的征兆，他们反对和平事业，并且是直接走向组织新的战争，无论是重复臭名昭著的邱吉尔对苏进军的形式，或者任何其他形式。因此也应提及这种事实，即英美联合参谋部至今仍然在华盛顿继续执行职务。如所周知，这个联合参谋部里英方代表为摩根将军率领的军事代表团，美方代表为李海海军上将所率领的军事代表团。这个为了统一对德及对日军事行动而建立的联合参谋部，虽然远在两年以前战争已告结束，却仍继续存在，谁也不知道它的目的何在！
    土希反动报纸的挑拨性叫嚣
    对土耳其好久以来就进行的不可原恕的毫无约束的谎言与挑拨、煽动反苏战争的宣传，这里没有必要列举这方面的许多事实。土耳其反动报纸力图与美国反动报纸并驾齐驱；俄国有句谚话描述这种情形：“马在前面跑，龙虾后面跟，马有蹄，龙虾只有两个钳”（按这一俄国俚语略近中国俗话“狐假虎威”之意）。土耳其报纸天天散布反苏污蔑，说“苏联计划占领土耳其”啦，（“巴山”报），挑拨性的预言“联合国家将从土海岸打击苏联”啦（“民主”报）。土耳其报界煽动土国人民准备战争，同时夸大美国力量，断言必须参加反苏战争，无可避免。臭名昭著的“堪胡因”报所发表的一个叫达维尔的论文，无耻露骨地宣称，战争是“使莫斯科走上正当途径的惟一方法”；“乌鲁斯”报表示附议，该报副主笔说：“美国及英国采取更进一步决定行动的时机已经成熟了。”以挑拨活动而臭名远扬的“坦”报主笔雅尔辛也起而效颦，去年九月他写道：“邀请苏联在头顶上挂有原子弹的会议桌上举行坦白会谈的时机到了。”他要求致苏联以最后通牒，并宣称：“假如他们不同意建立国际新秩序，原子弹将纷纷落在他们的头上。”这个雅尔辛最近写道：最后通牒是用来向莫斯科谈话的唯一语言，并要求“联合全世界以反对苏联。”某些撰稿人也发表相似的挑拨性意见，例如土耳其反动报纸“尔根勒空”的撰稿人艾迪兹，国会外委会委员尼特林教授等。这种挑拨性的叫嚣受到希腊反动报纸强力的支持，特别是“伊利空·伊马”报，日前该报发表论文称：“叫苏联不要忘了，苏联在巴库的主要油源只在一百公里以内，近在咫尺之间。”而所有这一切众目睽睽之下公然进行未受到谴责。这些就是和平之敌人的阴谋，为了他们自私的利益煽动新的战争。企图在以带给人类以新的灾难与不幸的新的战争中获取利益。这种挑拨新的战争的运动无疑地将遭到千百万人民严厉而坚决的谴责。
    苏联建议取缔新战争宣传及履行裁军等决定
    苏联政府认为，全世界各族人民的良知决不能容忍这种情势，他们担负不久以前第二次世界大战的全部重担，用他们的鲜血偿付战争所给与爱好和平人民身上苦难和破坏。苏联代表团代表苏联政府宣称：苏联认为联合国组织的紧急任务就是采取措施，以取缔现正在某些国家首先是美国所进行的新战争的宣传。因此，苏联代表团提请通过下列建议：
    （一）联合国组织应谴责在若干国家内特别是在美、土、希国内的反动分子所进行的新战争之罪恶宣传；他们通过报纸、广播、电影及公开演说，明目张胆要求进攻爱好和平的民主国家，散布种种捏造妄言以进行这种宣传。
    （二）联合国组织应认为：允许（更不必说支持）此种势将不免要造成第三次世界大战的新战争的宣传，就是违反联合国各会员国所负的义务。宪章要求“在尊重各民族平等权利与自决原则之基础上发展各国友好邦交，并采取其他适当措施以增强普遍和平”，而不是要求危害国际和平安全与正义。（宪章第十一条第二款）
    （三）联合国组织应认为必须敦促各会员国政府禁止在任何形式下进行新战争的宣传，违者即予以惩处。并采取措施，防止及制止战争的宣传，因为这是危害社会及威胁爱好和平人类生存攸关的利益与福利的。
    （四）联合国组织应重申必须及早履行联大一九四六年十二月十四日缩减军备的决定，以及一九四六年一月二十四日联大关于禁止各国使用原子武器及其他大量摧毁人类的军备的决定。并且联合国组织应认为履行这些决议系符合于一切爱好和平人类的利益，而构成对新战争宣传与煽动者的最猛烈的打击。
    斯大林委员长在致贺莫斯科的祝词中说：莫斯科是争取永久和平与全世界各民族友谊的先驱，是反对新战争煽动者的先驱。苏联人民领袖这些言辞，在全世界一切忠诚进步人民的心中获得了深深的响应。苏联坚决不遗余力争取胜利地完成这一伟大任务。（全文完。小题是新华社编者拟的）
