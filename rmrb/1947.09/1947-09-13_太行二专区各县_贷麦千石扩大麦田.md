　　Taihang Second Special District Counties
  　Loan of 1,000 Shi of Wheat to Expand Wheat Fields
    [Our Newspaper, Taihang News] Various counties in the Second Special District are vigorously supporting the expansion of wheat fields, and sowing has begun in various places. The special district has suffered from drought and hail, and a poor harvest in the entire district is a foregone conclusion. It is estimated that the average yield is only about 40% of a normal year. In order to survive the famine next spring, in addition to supplementing production through sideline occupations and handicrafts, all counties are seizing the opportunity to vigorously expand wheat fields. In addition to the 100,962,200 yuan in agricultural loans recently issued by the Special Commissioner's Office, an additional 1,100 shi of wheat has been allocated to support wheat planting in various places, and has now been distributed to various counties. Cooperatives in various places are going to Wuxiang and Xiangyuan, wheat-producing areas, to purchase wheat seeds on behalf of the masses. According to accurate statistics, the wheat fields in the Second Special District can be increased from 732,164.6 mu last year to more than 908,000 mu, which will play a significant role in surviving the famine next spring. According to incomplete statistics from 220 villages in ten districts of He, Zuo, Wu, Ping, Xi and other counties in August, 59,573.73 mu of uncultivated and newly reclaimed land have been eliminated. Most of these places are prepared to plant wheat. The White Dew solar term has arrived, and preparatory work has been largely completed. Sowing has begun in various places, and more than 5,000 mu of land in Heshun had been sown by the end of August. (Pi Yu, Xinghua)
    [Our Newspaper, South Hebei, 11th] Strive for early planting and increased harvesting of wheat, with Dong Dongli, Guangzong, busy turning over soil and delivering fertilizer. The village plans to plant 2,567 mu of wheat. Under the leadership of labor model Wei Baoqun and others, mutual aid teams are using all their manpower and livestock to plow the land twice and deliver fertilizer. They feel that the accumulated fertilizer is not enough, so many people are also dismantling kang (heated brick beds) and buying soybean cake and rapeseed cake with sideline dividends. Military dependent Li Genniang has never planted wheat before, but this year she has also set aside six mu of wheat land and will convert two mu of stubble land to wheat, delivering nine cartloads of fertilizer to the land and buying 200 jin of rapeseed cake. On average, each mu of wheat land in the whole village receives at least 1.5 cartloads of fertilizer. Because the mutual aid of manpower, livestock, and agricultural tools has been adjusted, the difficulty of planting wheat has been resolved. As Liu Yankuo said: "Without mutual aid, the wheat land of the poor could not be plowed so promptly." The mutual aid teams are now planning a major change of work for autumn harvesting and wheat planting.

　　太行二专区各县
  　贷麦千石扩大麦田
    【本报太行讯】二专区各县大力扶助扩大麦田，各地并已开始播种。该专区遭受旱灾、雹灾，全区歉收已成定局，估计平均仅有四成多年成，为渡过明春灾荒，除在副业手工业上生产弥补外，各县均抓紧大力扩展麦田。专署除于最近贷出一万万零九百六十二万二千元农贷款外，近又增拨一千一百石麦子，扶助各地种麦，现已分至各县。各地合作社纷到产麦区武乡、襄垣给群众代购麦种。据精确的统计：二专麦田可由去年的七十三万二千一百六十四亩六分，增加至九十万八千余亩，这对渡过明春灾荒将起重大作用。据八月份和、左、武、平、昔等县十个区二百二十个村的不完全统计，已消灭生熟荒五万九千五百七十三亩七分三。这些地方大部准备种麦。白露已至，准备工作均已大体就绪。各地都已开始下种，八月底以前和顺已有五千余亩土地下种。（丕玉、兴华）
    【本报冀南十一日电】争取麦地早种多收，广宗东董里翻土送粪忙。该村准备种麦二五六七亩，在劳动模范卫保群等领导下，各互助组正以全部人畜力翻二遍地和送粪，他们把所积的肥送到地里，还觉着不够，很多人又动手拆炕，并以副业红利买豆饼、菜子饼等。军属立根娘从来没种过麦，今年也晒（留）了六亩麦地，还要把二亩茬子地改种麦，把九大车粪送到地里，又买了二百斤菜子饼。全村麦地，每亩平均至少上一车半粪。由于互助人畜力农具调剂开了，解决了种麦困难，如刘言可说：“若不互助，穷人麦地可不能犁的这么及时。”现各互助组正计划秋收、种麦大变工。
