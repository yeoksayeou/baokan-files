    Expanding Wheat Fields by Utilizing Conditions
    Water Shortage in Shangyu Village
    [This newspaper, Xiangyuan news] Shangyu Village, in the First District, originally had over 4,000 mu of land, including over 302 mu of wasteland in the river bend due to water erosion. After the enemy occupied Xiangyuan in 1938, they forced the peasants to perform corvée labor to build blockhouses, leaving over 300 mu of good land barren for several years, without being reclaimed. Last month, the county party committee called for the expansion of wheat fields. Comrade Hao Zhongbao, the village party secretary, and all party members led the entire village's peasants to reclaim the wasteland. In seven days, they reclaimed 288 mu of eroded wasteland. There were originally over 900 mu of wheat stubble, and now over 800 mu have been planted, with an average of 45 dan of fertilizer applied per mu.
