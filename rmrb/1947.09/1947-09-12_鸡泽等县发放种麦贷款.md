　　Jize and Other Counties
　　Loan Distribution for Wheat Planting
　　[Our newspaper's report from Southern Hebei, 10th] To solve the difficulties of the masses with plowing cattle, seeds, and fertilizer, Ji County, Longping, Yaoshan, and Jize have provided huge loans to support the masses in planting wheat. Ji County loaned 30 million yuan and called for a widespread mole cricket catching campaign before planting to eliminate a major pest to wheat seedlings after planting. Longping and Yaoshan focused on lending 10 million yuan, which is expected to buy 50 head of cattle, enabling the plowing of an additional 3,000 mu of land, and buy 43,000 jin of wheat seeds, enough to plant over 7,100 mu of wheat land. Jize loaned 20 million yuan, which can buy 222 head of cattle, striving for two to three plowings of all wheat land, achieving deep plowing and careful cultivation for a bumper harvest next year.
　　[Our newspaper's report from Southern Hebei, 10th] Qi Zhi County, due to consecutive years of natural disasters, is vigorously reclaiming wasteland to compensate for the lack of harvest. In July, they have reclaimed 12,370 mu of wasteland, all planted with late seedlings and autumn vegetables, and are continuing to reclaim more land in preparation for planting a large amount of wheat. In Malan Village, there are fifteen qing of wasteland. Nearby villages organized manpower and animal power, helping each other in a concentrated effort, and have now reclaimed more than ten qing of wasteland. All thirty-three qing of wasteland in the seventh district have also been completely reclaimed. To reward this effort, the government stipulates that wasteland farmers who cultivate the reclaimed land will be paid wages in rice (15 jin of millet per day for two livestock) according to the number of labor service rice owed, to be paid after the autumn harvest if they cannot afford it now; those who rent the wasteland will not pay land rent or bear burdens for three years. The County Committee calls on cadres in all districts to specifically lead this work, ensuring that all wasteland is reclaimed before autumn and that wheat planting is not delayed.
