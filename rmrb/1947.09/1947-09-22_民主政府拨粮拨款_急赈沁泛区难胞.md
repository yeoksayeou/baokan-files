    Democratic Government Allocates Grain and Funds for Emergency Relief to Flood Victims in the Qin River Area

    [This newspaper's Taihang dispatch, 27th] After the Jiang bandits in Wuhi broke the Da Fan dike of the Qin River on August 14th, the local democratic government immediately telegraphed the Taihang Administrative Office and sent personnel to carry out post-disaster relief and pacification. The investigation revealed that the floodwaters spread as wide as thirteen li. Thirty-five villages in Xiuwu and eighteen in Wuhi were flooded and destroyed. In the above two areas alone, the number of affected people totaled 24,723, and over 55,260 mu of nearly ripe crops were washed away. Recently, the democratic government has been assisting the masses in blocking villages and diverting water. The floodwaters have receded to a width of four li. The Xiuwu democratic government, in addition to allocating 150 shi of grain to relieve the disaster victims who are unable to live, has also distributed 6 shi of vegetable seeds to the masses for emergency sowing to compensate for the losses of this year's autumn harvest. The Wuhi democratic government allocated 20 shi of grain. The Fourth Administrative Office has also allocated 30,000 jin of relief grain and loans of 7 million yuan to the disaster areas in the two counties to restore women's spinning and weaving, prepare for wheat planting, and carry out production for self-relief. The local military and political authorities plan to organize the masses to start rebuilding the dike after the water recedes this autumn.

    【本报太行二十七日电】武陟蒋匪于八月十四日掘开沁河大樊堤后，当地民主政府即一面电告太行行署，一面派员前往进行善后安抚。调查结果，洪水出泛，宽达十三里，修武被淹毁村庄三十五个，武陟十八个。仅上述两地受灾群众，共两万四千七百二十三人，冲毁即将成熟之庄稼五万五千二百六十余亩。近日来民主政府正协助群众堵村、堵水，漫出水势，已落至四里宽。修武民主政府，除已拨粮一百五十石救济当下无法生活之灾民外，并发给群众六石菜籽突击撒种，以补本年秋收损失。武陟民主政府拨粮二十石。四专署对该两县受灾区，亦分拨救济粮三万斤，贷款七百万元，以恢复妇纺，准备种麦，进行生产自救，当地军政当局计划秋后水小时组织群众动工复堤。
