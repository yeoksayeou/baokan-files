Steadily Supporting the Masses
	Suqiu Village in Ningnan Conducts Thorough Re-examination and Struggles Against Landlords
[Our Newspaper, Jinnan, 8th Dispatch] Educating village cadres, supporting the masses, recognizing that landlords can feign ignorance, and promptly breaking down sentiments of pity and complacency, the re-examination in Suqiu Village, Second District of Ningnan, is proceeding step by step, deepening the struggle. The village underwent a major campaign last year, but the landlords’ floating assets, brick houses, and good land were left untouched. At the “July 7th” Memorial Meeting, more than forty activists from the poor and hired peasant class recalled their past suffering and unanimously felt that they still lacked cattle, farm tools, and housing, and that their liberation was incomplete. They demanded that all eleven large landlord households be detained and a second investigation be conducted. The leadership then approved the masses’ request. Over the past month and a half, over 11,300 silver dollars have been uncovered. There are also nine silver ingots, sixty-seven jars of copper coins, eight hundred and forty-two pieces of gold and silver artifacts, more than two thousand eight hundred articles of clothing, more than six thousand five hundred feet of cloth and silk, more than two thousand pieces of farm tools and wooden implements, more than ten thousand catties of grain, and two hundred and six brick houses. At the beginning of the movement, due to the leadership’s lack of decisiveness during last year’s major campaign, village cadres did not follow the mass line and were corrupt and distributed the fruits unfairly. The masses reflected, “Sparrows follow bats in flight, straining their eyes but unable to eat.” The leadership then conducted class education among the cadres, calling on them to perform meritorious service in the re-examination. The director of the peasant association reflected, “Last year, seeing other villages engaging in struggle, our village also engaged in struggle, just to go through the motions.” Most of the cadres reflected that they had drunk the landlords’ wine last year and had not been ruthless enough, and they resolved to perform meritorious service to atone for their sins. Furthermore, following the masses' opinions, the militia captain Wang Dongze, who had colluded with the landlords last year and remained unrepentant this year, was dismissed from his post, and the masses became more confident and assertive. The peasant association representative Guan Shuanzi, who had accepted bribes from the landlords last year and was still delivering food to the landlords during the re-examination, was also dismissed. When some cadres’ family members and military dependents tried to interfere again as they had done last year, the masses simply replied, “The struggle will continue until it is thorough; you can't interfere!” Then the interrogation team first pursued the wealthy landlord Feng Laoyong, who had fled with eighteen silver ingots during last year’s campaign. Initially, only three hundred silver dollars were recovered, but when he could no longer deny it, he revealed two thousand two hundred silver dollars and a piece of silver. At this time, the propaganda team convened a meeting of all the masses and announced this. Only then did the masses realize that he had been feigning poverty by telling his wife and children to gather firewood. Next, they launched a comparison of housing, land, and living standards, completely breaking the “almost the same” mentality. Then, they questioned the landlord Wang Fuxing. At first, he admitted to five hundred silver dollars and two pieces of silver. During the interrogation, he pretended to beg his mother, saying, "Do you want your son, or do you want the silver?" His mother also pretended to say, "I want my son!" Then she fished out two pieces of silver from the well. Everyone thought it was thorough, so they stopped pursuing. Later, the two hundred and eighty silver dollars he had buried in the pigsty were unearthed by the pigs. After the masses discovered this, they detained his mother again and recovered eight hundred silver dollars. From the landlord Guan Zhixin's house, seven hundred and sixty dollars were recovered. The masses thought there was nothing left. When they were cleaning things up, they found more than three thousand silver dollars under the floor tiles of the house. Guan Zhixin, fearing that the masses would continue to pursue him, ran to the temple and pretended to be crazy. Some people felt sorry for him; later, however, another two hundred and fifty silver dollars and a jar of copper coins were recovered. The landlord Feng Xiaoxi begged for food for several days, seemingly truly poor. Later, however, three carts of bundles and furniture were cleared out of his house. Everyone transported the property of the eleven landlord households with nine large carts for several days, piling it up in the courtyard and houses. Some people felt that there was much more than last year, and some became complacent again. The leadership then introduced the landlords’ methods of concealment, pointing out that if the “air raid shelters” were not dug out, the liberation would not be thorough. They used the facts to awaken the class consciousness of the silent masses, so that they would ideologically separate themselves from the landlords. On the other hand, they also pressured the landlords to say who they had stored things with. The landlord Song Lingzhao told his wife that he had stored bundles at the home of the village deputy Zhang Gouzi, the deserter Feng Xiao×, and the poor peasant woman Xiao Jiu. With these facts, the masses were repeatedly educated: "Liberation means liberating your thoughts; don't be fooled by the landlords." "Sooner or later you will not be able to escape, it's better to report it sooner." Two days later, more than thirty people reported, bringing out more than one hundred and fifty bundles, all of which were silks and jewels. At this point, the masses became more aware of the landlords’ conspiracies. Currently, thirty men and women struggle targets from the landlord class are being detained together to continue the investigation.

　　步步给群众撑腰
  　宁南素邱村复查深入斗透地主
    【本报冀南八日电】教育村干，给群众撑腰，认清地主能装蒜，及时打破怜悯自满思想，宁南二区素邱村复查，步步深入。该村去年大动，对地主的浮财砖房好地，都没动。“七七”纪念会上，四十多名雇贫积极分子翻身回忆中，一致感到还是没牛、农具、房，翻身不透，要求把十一户大地主一齐扣押，二次追查。领导上遂批准群众要求。个半月来，已查出银元一万一千三百多元。元宝九个，铜子六十七罐，金银器八百四十二件，衣服两千八百多件，布匹绸缎达六千五百多尺，农具木器两千多件，粮食一万余斤，砖房二百零六间。运动初时，由于去年大动领导上不够放手，村干不走群众路线，贪污并多分果实。群众反映：“麻雀跟着蝙蝠飞，熬眼吃不了物”，领导上在干部中进行阶级教育，号召在复查中立功。农会主任反省：“去年见别村斗，自己村就斗，为的应付公事。”大部分干部，都反省了去年喝了地主的酒，没下狠心，决心立功赎罪。又遵照群众意见，把去年运动中和地主勾搭、今年仍不觉悟的民兵队长王东泽撤职，于是群众就腰硬气壮了。把去年受地主贿赂，复查中又给地主送饭的农会代表管拴子罢免了。当一些干属、军属又象去年一样上场管事，群众干脆回答：“斗净为止，你管不了！”接着审讯股首先追向去年运动中带十八块元宝逃跑的大地主冯老永。开始只追出了银币三百元，后见抵赖不过，乃说出银元两千二百元，银子一部。这时宣传股召开全体群众会宣布。群众才觉悟他过去叫老婆孩子拾柴，全是装蒜。继之展开比房、比地、比生活，“差不多”思想完全打破，接着追问地主王复兴。开始说出了五百银元、两块银子。在追问中，他向他娘装腔哀求道：“你要儿，还是要银子。”他娘也装着说：“我要儿！”乃从井里捞出两块银子，大家认为彻底，便不再追。后来他埋在猪圈里二百八十块银元，却被猪弄出来，群众发觉后，又把他娘扣住，追出八百块银元。地主管之信家，追出七百六十元。群众以为没有了，清理东西时，从屋地砖下发现了三千多块银元，管之信怕群众再追，跑到庙里装疯，有人怜惜；后来却又追出银元二百五十元，铜子一罐。地主冯小喜要饭数日，好象真穷，后来又从他家清出包袱、家具三车。大家把十一户地主的财物用九辆大车搬运了数日，堆积满院满屋，有些人觉得比去年多得多，又有些自满。领导上即介绍地主隐蔽方式，提出挖不掉“防空洞”，翻身翻不透，以事实启发不吭气群众的阶级觉悟，使之在思想上与地主分家；另方面并逼问地主，在谁家存有东西。地主宋伶照老婆说出在村副张狗子、逃亡战士冯小×及贫农妇女小九家，存有包袱。以此事实，再三教育群众：“翻身翻思想，不上地主当。”“早晚脱不了，还是早报好”。两天后，自报者三十多人，搞出一百五十多个包袱，都是绸绫珍宝。至此群众更加认识地主阴谋，现已将三十户斗争对象男女，一齐扣押，继续追查。
