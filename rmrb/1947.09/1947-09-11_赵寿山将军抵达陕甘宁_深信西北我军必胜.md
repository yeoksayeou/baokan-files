Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 7th. General Zhao Shoushan, a famous general of the Northwest Army and former Commander-in-Chief of the Third Group Army of the Kuomintang, arrived safely in a certain area of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region on the 1st from the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Liberated Area. Lin Boqu, Chairman of the Border Region Government, and Ma Mingfang, Deputy Secretary of the Northwest Bureau of the CPC, held a banquet to welcome him. Regarding the Northwest war situation, Zhao stated his views to reporters: "Hu Zongnan's troops invading the border region are bound to be annihilated in the mountains of northern Shaanxi. The people of Guanzhong call his army 'tofu army'. How can an army with such poor quality, poor training, no combat experience for many years, coupled with strategic errors and popular opposition everywhere, not fail?" Zhao recalled that when Hu Zongnan attacked Yan'an this spring, Hu asked him: "What do you think about me attacking Yan'an?" At that time, General Zhao asked Hu Zongnan in return: "What will you do if you can't take Yan'an?" Then he jokingly said: "The Communist Party will definitely 'let' you have Yan'an, attract your troops into the interior, and launch guerrilla warfare everywhere to eliminate you!" General Zhao continued: "Now the fact is exactly like this, and I firmly believe that the People's Liberation Army is bound to win. Because the army and people in the liberated areas know that they are fighting for their own survival, which is the basic condition for defeating Chiang Kai-shek." Although Zhao had traveled a long distance, he was still in high spirits. He has now been reunited with his wife, Ms. Huang Juren, who arrived in northern Shaanxi three months ago after traveling from the KMT-controlled area, as well as his son and daughter-in-law who were originally in northern Shaanxi. Zhao also stated that the people of his hometown, Guanzhong, under the oppression of Hu Zongnan, have reached the end of their tolerance and are rising up to resist grain requisition, tax collection, and conscription. Zhao expressed his determination to join hands with the people of the liberated areas to eliminate Hu Zongnan.

　　赵寿山将军抵达陕甘宁
  　深信西北我军必胜
    【新华社西北七日电】西北军名将前国民党第三集团军总司令赵寿山将军，已于一日由晋冀鲁豫解放区安抵陕甘宁边区某地。边府林伯渠主席、中共西北局副书记马明芳等特设宴欢迎。赵氏就西北战局对记者发表观感称：“胡宗南进犯边区的军队，必将覆灭于陕北的山地，大关中老百姓把他的军队叫“豆腐军”，象这种素质不好，训练又差，多年没打过仗，再加上战略错误以及人民又到处反对的军队，还能不失败吗？”赵氏追溯今春胡宗南进攻延安时，胡曾问他：“我要打延安你看怎样？”当时赵将军反问胡宗南：“你打不下延安可又怎么办？”随后他又诙谐的说：“共产党一定会把延安给你‘让’出来，把你的军队吸引到内地，到处展开游击战消灭你！”赵将军继称：“现在事实恰巧就是这样，我深信人民解放军是必胜的。因为解放区军民都知道为自己生存而战，这是战胜蒋介石的基本条件。”赵氏虽经长途跋涉，精神仍极健旺，现已与其三月前由蒋管区辗转来陕北的夫人黄居仁女士及原在陕北的公子媳妇重获团聚。赵氏并称：他的故乡大关中人民在胡宗南的压榨下，现已忍无可忍，正纷起抗粮抗捐抗丁，赵氏表示决与解放区人民携手一道消灭胡宗南。
