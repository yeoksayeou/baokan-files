　　[This newspaper, Taiyue, 21st dispatch] On the 19th, people from all walks of life in Taiyue held a rally in Yangcheng to celebrate the People's Liberation Army's large-scale counter-offensive and to send off over a thousand newly liberated soldiers from Yangcheng to join the counter-offensive front lines. Over ten thousand people attended, all extremely excited. Especially the family members who came from all over to see off their husbands or sons enlisting felt unparalleled glory and joy, and were respected everywhere. The rally began at 3 PM. Over a thousand newly liberated soldiers, holding high red plaques with the four characters "Kill the Enemy and Render Meritorious Service," entered the venue, immediately followed by thunderous applause and cheers: "Celebrate the People's Liberation Army's great counter-offensive, support the front lines with practical actions!" "Good men go to the counter-offensive front lines to kill old Chiang!" This stirred up the cadres and masses present, who enthusiastically proposed to make mutual guarantees with those going to the front lines, render meritorious service in the great counter-offensive, and submitted written pledges of meritorious service. In his opening speech, Director Niu of the Administrative Office, in addition to reporting the good news of the counter-offensive's victory, put forward several calls to everyone: (1) Fully support the front lines, not only to cross the Yellow River, but also to eliminate the remaining white spots such as Yuncheng and Linfen in our area. (2) Boldly and resolutely implement land reform, which is the foundation for the victory of the great counter-offensive. (3) Strive for production, eliminate wasteland, plant more wheat, and step up textile and transportation. (4) All agencies must further investigate class and ideology, clarify their own positions, and adapt to the requirements of the new situation. Model army family member Wang Yuan then instructed the new soldiers going to the front, saying: "For the victory of the great counter-offensive to come soon, we must endure hardship and be hardworking, obey orders, abide by discipline, and complete our tasks!" At this time, the crowd shouted: "We will not return home until old Chiang is killed!" The new soldiers submitted pledges of meritorious service to their villages and families. The pledge of all the new soldiers in the Fourth District read: "We will wholeheartedly render meritorious service for the people, and we will resolutely not return home until the Chiang bandits are killed and all of China is liberated!..."

　　[This newspaper, Hebei-Shandong-Henan, 17th dispatch] After the news of the nationwide great counter-offensive reached the border region, students of the Second Middle School launched a wave of joining the army, with 114 registering to join. The Second Middle School is a middle school in the Third Sub-district, and their hometowns are mostly in enemy hands, with their elders suffering the trampling and massacre of the Chiang bandits. Therefore, when the news of the great counter-offensive arrived, everyone was extremely excited. In order to strengthen the counter-offensive forces, they shouted the slogans "It is glorious to join the army, protect the fields and avenge revenge" and rushed to sign up to join the army, with 134 people joining. Before leaving, everyone unanimously stated that they would resolutely fight to the end to overthrow Chiang Kai-shek!"
