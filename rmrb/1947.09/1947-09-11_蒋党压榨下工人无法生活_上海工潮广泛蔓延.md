Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 8th. Workers in Shanghai, in their struggle to improve their treatment and seek survival, have broken through the Chiang Kai-shek clique's reactionary measures prohibiting strikes, and the situation is becoming increasingly intense. According to delayed reports from Shanghai newspapers: Shanghai's lead-printing workers and printing workers, objecting to the results of the "Labor-Management Arbitration Committee's" assessment of index disputes, which stipulated that living allowances for workers and their families must be issued at 85% or 90% of the living index formulated by the Chiang government, rose up in opposition and launched a general strike on July 14th. Although the special agent boss Wu Kaixian shouted that "a sudden strike is truly illegal," and the Chiang clique's mayor Wu Guozhen also ordered the police bureau to crack down on this "illegal action," the workers still persisted in the strike for as long as four days. Immediately following this, more than 300 unemployed workers from the French-owned tram company, due to the failure to obtain a result in their demand for reinstatement guarantees, went en masse to the lawn of the company's head office to engage in a hunger strike, camping in the open. Although the Chiang clique's police bureau sent red riot control vehicles to suppress them, the unemployed workers were unmoved. From 4:00 PM on the 18th to 3:00 PM on the 19th, after persisting for an entire day, the Chiang clique's police bureau agreed to negotiate with the management, and the workers left. At the same time, unemployed workers from the Jiangnan Shipyard also petitioned again, demanding a swift resumption of work. Waiters at the International Hotel also surrounded the hotel's personnel section chief, a certain Mr. Wu, on the 21st to demand the revocation of a transfer order. In addition, according to incomplete materials disclosed by other newspapers, from the middle of July to the end of that month, in just half a month, labor disputes caused by wages, the cost of living index, and layoffs have swept through a wide range of industries, including tea and kitchen workers, dock workers, shipping, silk weaving, wax food, machinery, silver jewelry, the British-owned tram company, civil aviation, and the mechanical staff of shipping companies. Zhao Banfu, the head of the Chiang clique's Shanghai Labor Office, who is famous for suppressing the labor movement, was also helpless and was forced to resign, claiming to be "seriously ill."

　　蒋党压榨下工人无法生活
  　上海工潮广泛蔓延
    【新华社陕北八日电】上海工人为改善待遇求生存之斗争，已冲决蒋党禁止罢工之反动措施而益趋高涨。综合沪报迟到消息：沪铅印业工人印刷业工人以“劳资评断会”对指数纠纷评断结果，竟规定工人及家属之生活津贴须按照蒋政府御制之生活指数八五折或九折发给，群起反对，并于七月十四日举行总罢工。特务头子吴开先虽大呼“遽行罢工，实不合法”，蒋记市长吴国桢亦下令警察局取缔此项“非法行动”，但工人仍坚持罢工达四日之久。紧接着有法商电车公司失业工人三百余人，因要求复职保证未获结果，全体至该公司总写字间之草坪上露宿绝食斗争，蒋记警局虽开来红色警备车弹压，但失业工人丝毫不为所动，自十八日下午四时起至十九日下午三时，坚持一整天后，蒋记警局允与资方谈判，工人都离去。同时江南造船所失业工人亦再度请愿；要求迅速复工，国际饭店待应生亦因反对调职，于二十一日包围该饭店人事科主任吴某要求收回成命。加上其他报纸披露的据不完全材料，综计自七月至中旬至该月底止短短半个月内，因工资的生活指数、解雇等纠纷而引起之工潮已席卷茶厨工人，码头工人及轮船业，丝织业，蜡味业，机器业，银楼业，英商电车，民航和航轮机职工等广阔范围。以镇压工运闻名之蒋记上海劳工处长赵班斧对此亦束手无策，被迫借名“患病甚重”，坚决辞职。
