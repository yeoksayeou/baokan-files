　　Licheng Xia Village Masses
  　Inspect Landlords' Production Performance, Heighten Vigilance and Strictly Control Them

　　[This report from Licheng] The Xia Village has gained experience in rectifying mutual aid and managing landlords. After the land reform, peasants had land to cultivate and wanted to develop their families through production. However, special agent feudal landlords not only did not actively engage in production and keep pace with the peasants, but also exploited loopholes to sabotage. Among the forty-four households who were struggled against in the village, nine households, including Wang Guitang, sought opportunities to sabotage and counterattack the peasants. Thirty-five households, including Li Shu'ao, were not convinced in their hearts. To avoid being struggled against, they obediently followed the peasants' command in their work. Wang Zhaoduan and others infiltrated small-scale cooperative sideline production to seek easy tasks. Therefore, this year's mutual aid is more complex and difficult to lead than any other year. Wang Wensheng, the mutual aid team leader, said: "I have been leading mutual aid for four or five years, but this year is the most difficult. It really makes people worry." Now, I would like to present some experiences in rectification:

　　1. Rely on poor and hired peasants, inspect the landlords' performance, and enlighten the peasants' class consciousness. First, convene a meeting of branch party members, poor peasants, hired peasants and activists to examine the landlords' performance in the past six months and raise vigilance. For example, Wang Wensheng's team of sixteen households included three feudal landlords and four laborers. The poor peasant meeting revealed the landlords' sabotage activities. Wang Baocang, a liberated peasant, said, "When weeding, I said I couldn't keep up because I didn't have enough labor. The landlord Wang Quan then said: 'If you divide up a few more acres, you won't be afraid of wasteland. Who told you to divide the fruits? Like me, I earn work points and don't leave any land barren.'" Wang Jing said: "When we give mutual aid to the landlords, we work honestly, but they always give us thin gruel instead of real food." Changfang said: "He deliberately didn't spread fertilizer evenly and deliberately broke the hoe handle." He Juhai said: "The landlords used to exploit our blood and sweat, and now they are still exploiting us. The special agent landlord Wang Zhaoduan admitted last winter that he would pay back the debt with labor. Now he has infiltrated the small-scale cooperative, and we still give him work to carry night soil and fertilizer, doing the work for him. He can never pay back the blood and sweat debt in his lifetime, so he seeks easy work and doesn't sweat. I can never be satisfied with this." There are many similar problems in each team. Everyone unanimously realized that the special agent landlords are still not reconciled and will sabotage whenever they have the opportunity.

　　2. Peasants examine themselves and determine to strictly control the landlords. Then the peasants examined their own attitudes towards the landlords. Wang Fengqi said: "I used to think of the landlord as a person. After he admitted his mistakes last winter, he should work hard and undergo some changes. We treated him honestly, but who knew he would still actively sabotage? The enemy is always the enemy. Treating him as one of our own will lead to great losses. Make him carry big buckets of night soil and do heavy work, so he can taste the bitterness of the peasants." Wang Kuanxing said: "No matter how well the landlord says, he has a knife hidden in his heart. We used to not be able to ask him about the livestock and often pushed the mill ourselves. He even said that Kuanxing would only push the mill in his lifetime. I was really sad. Let him try it too." Wang Tianwen said: "We didn't pay attention to him before, but we must strictly control him from now on. He can't move around freely without a travel permit. The surplus work from sideline production can't be distributed as dividends. Those engaged in sideline production should be squeezed out and transferred to agriculture." Everyone agreed with his opinion.

　　3. One team promotes the whole village: First, Wang Jinming's team studied methods to isolate the worst guys, forbidding them from borrowing things, making them feel difficult, and then discussing conditions when they come to ask. First, four households, including Wang Guonan, were isolated. Wang Fuyan and others came to admit their mistakes and made guarantees, and then they were accepted back. On August 28th, Wang Wensheng's team was rectified, and all the team leaders and activists came to visit and learn. There were more than fifty people in total, and they exposed the special agent landlords' conspiracies and tricks one by one. When questioning the special agent landlord Wang Guitang's thoughts, he said that his thoughts were backward and that he had special agent thoughts. When asked who asked him to be a special agent, he answered Chiang Kai-shek. He stubbornly resisted and did not reason. The peasants combined reasoning with sticks and beat him hard, which truly vented their grievances. They resolutely refused to let him go unpunished and forced him to admit that he would obey the peasants' transfer and command. He had to get a travel permit to go out more than one li. The surplus labor could not be distributed as dividends. His wages were generally six jin of rice per day, but they were reduced to three jin of rice per day. Wang Pei admitted his mistake and made a guarantee, allowing him to continue reflecting in the team, with the same reduction in wages. The second morning, Guitang and his son, with their pain and injuries, called on people to go to the fields. The peasants said, "They are born with cheap bones." This method promoted the whole village, and each team was rectified together. Wang Jinming's team even squeezed the special agent landlord Wang Zhaoduan out of the small-scale cooperative and made him participate in agricultural labor, and also made him spread manure, requiring diligent work. Finally, a meeting of liberated peasants was held to summarize, which further consolidated everyone's thinking. This kind of rectification laid a solid foundation for the autumn harvest movement and winter production. (Wang Changqun et al.)

  　检查地主生产表现提高警惕严加管制
    【本报黎城讯】霞庄村整顿互助管理地主，取得经验。土地改革后，农民有了地种，要求生产发家。特务封建地主们，不但不积极生产跟上农民走，而且在钻空破坏，全村被斗争者四十四户，有王贵堂等九户是瞅空破坏，向农民反攻，李叔敖等三十五户心中不服。为免出事挨斗，做活上服从了农民指挥。王兆端等钻入小型合作副业生产讨轻头。因此今年的互助比任何一年都复杂、难领导，互助组长王文生说：“我领导了四五年互助，数今年难干哩，真把人愁死啦。”现将整顿的几点经验提出：
    一、依靠贫雇，检查地主表现，启发农民阶级觉悟。首先召开支部党员贫雇积极分子会议，检查地主半年来的表现，提高警惕。如王文生组十六户有三户封建地主，四个劳力，在贫雇会上检查出地主破坏活动；翻身农民王保仓说，“锄地时说了个没劳力赶不上，地主王铨就说：再多分几亩就不怕荒地啦，谁叫你分果实来，象我又赚工票又不荒地。”王京说：“咱给地主互助是老老实实干，人家给咱物谷故总吃稀。”长芳说：“他撒肥故意不撒匀，故意折断铣把。”何聚海说：“地主过去剥削咱血汗，现在还剥削，特务地主王兆端去年冬承认劳动还咱债，他现在钻到小型合作社，咱还工给他担圊运肥做生活，血汗债他一辈也还不了就讨轻活就不出汗，对这我死也不能满意。”各组类似以上问题很多，大家一致明确认识了特务地主还不死心，有空就进行破坏。
    二、农民检讨自己，确定严格管理地主。接着农民又检讨自己对地主的态度，王逢奇说：“我以前想地主他是个人，去年冬承认以后要好好干，该有个三移九转，咱是老老实实对待他，谁知道他还积极破坏，敌人啥时也是敌人，当成自己人即要吃大亏。担圊叫他担大桶，做重活，尝农民的苦。”王宽兴说：“不管地主说的怎样好，心里装着一把刀，咱过去问不出人家牲口，常是人推磨，他还说宽兴一辈就会推，我真伤心，叫他也得试试。”王天文说：“咱以前不注意他，今后总得严格管理起来，出门开路条不能随便活动，副业剩余工不能分红，搞副业的挤出来转上农业，大家都同意他的意见。
    三、一组推动全村：首先是王金明队研究办法，统一孤立最坏家伙，不准给他借东西，使他感到困难，来找再讲条件，先孤立出王过南等四户，王富彦等来找承认了错误，提出保证，又收下了他。八月廿八日，整顿王文生小组，各组长和积极分子，都来参观学习，共有五十多人，一一揭发特务地主阴谋诡计，追问特务地主王贵堂思想时，他说我思想落后，我是特务思想，问谁叫你当特务来，答蒋介石，他顽皮抵抗不讲道理，农民讲理结合棍棒痛打一顿，才真出了冤气，坚决不让他自流，承认服从农民调动指挥，出外一里即得开路条，剩余劳力不能分红，工资一般六斤米他降为每工三斤米。王培承认错误提出保证，让他在组继续反省，工资同样降低。第二早贵堂父子带的痛伤，叫人上地，农民们说：“天生是贱骨头”。这种办法推动了全村，各组一齐整顿。王金明队更把特务地主王兆端挤出小型合作社，参加了农业劳动，并让他多摊勤工，最后召开翻身农民会总结，更巩固了大家思想，这种整顿给收耕运动和冬季生产打下坚实基础。（王长群等）
