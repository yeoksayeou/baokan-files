　　Huguan Chengguan Women Exquisitely Craft Military Shoes

    [Report from our newspaper in Huguan] When the cadres and women of Chengnan Street heard about making military shoes, they immediately prepared the raw materials to welcome this task. The village deputy and those in charge of finance and grain actively dyed cloth, and Li Genshun, the manager of the cooperative, specially sent someone to Changzhi to buy hemp. When women like Cheng Junze and Wang Chunze heard about making military shoes, they stayed up day and night at home washing cloth shirts and making padded vests. After the district formally assigned this task, Shen Lianze (female), the deputy director of the militia, and Wang Renmin, the chairman of the Women's Salvation Association, actively led the women in studying how to carry out this work. Shen Lianze also proposed: "This time, the military shoes must be good, fast, and fair." During the discussion, military family member Cheng Haidong said: "Making military shoes is not for others, but for ourselves. Our children and men are protecting us in the front, so we should make the military shoes well." Women like Wang Chunze said: "I was very happy when I heard about making military shoes, so I quickly prepared things at home and strived to finish first. If the Eighth Route Army hadn't come, we wouldn't be where we are today." After everyone's discussion, the following methods were studied: In terms of raw materials, the township office is responsible for purchasing cloth, hemp, and cloth shirts, and all raw materials are concentrated in the township office. In terms of production, there is a division of labor and cooperation, and collective production. All the women in the village are actively working, and the division of labor is based on individual work ability. Those who can do something do it, such as the elderly twisting ropes, those good at mending shoes mend shoes, and those good at laying soles and uppers lay them, so that everyone can make the best use of their talents, and the shoes are made well and quickly. It was also decided to use a work-point method to ensure fairness. After the discussion, the women were very enthusiastic. After calculation, twenty-six pairs of military shoes can be completed in seven days, but the women proposed: Work day and night and strive to complete them in five days. (Liang Bi, De Fu)

　　壶关城关妇女精工细制军鞋
    【本报壶关讯】城北街干部妇女听到要做军鞋时，即连忙准备原料，迎接这一工作。村副、财粮等人都积极染布，合作社经理李根顺同志专派人到长治买麻。妇女程俊则、王春则等听到做军鞋，即日夜在家洗布衫打背子。这一工作由区正式布置后，民兵副主任申连则（女）与妇救主席王仁民等即积极领导妇女研究这一工作如何进行，申连则并提出：“这次军鞋要好要快要公道”。在讨论中军属程海东说：“做军鞋不是给别人做，是给咱自己做哩，咱的孩子男人在前方保卫咱，咱应把军鞋做好才对。”王春则等妇女都说：“我听到做军鞋，心里很高兴，就赶快在家准备东西，争取先完成，不是八路军来，咱还能到这地步。”这样经过大家讨论，研究出以下办法：原料上，布麻布衫都由公所负责购买，将原料都集中到公所。制做上，分工合作，集体制做。全村妇女都在积极做，按个人做活能力分工，能干啥干啥，如老年人搓绳，缮鞋好的缮鞋，铺底帮好的就铺，这样人尽其才，做鞋又好又快。并决定折工办法，保证公道。讨论后，妇女情绪很高，经过计算二十六对军鞋，七天能完成，但妇女们提出：日夜加工，争取五天完成。（良弼、德富）
