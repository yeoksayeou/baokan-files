　　Northeast News Undertaking
　　In the past year, the news undertaking in the Northeast Liberated Areas has had more than twenty large and small newspapers, fifteen Xinhua News Agency branch offices, seven spoken-word radio stations, more than a thousand journalists, and a large number of correspondents. They have made great contributions to the Patriotic Self-Defense War, land reform, and various production and construction endeavors in the Liberated Areas.
　　The Northeast Daily now has more than 300 news cadres and has gradually become the guiding center for the entire Northeast Liberated Area in terms of politics, ideology, and work. After the Democratic Allied Forces withdrew from Andong and Tonghua, the South Manchuria news workers persisted in the Changbai Mountains, carried out the struggle against the enemy, and some went deep into the enemy areas and border areas to carry out communication work and maintain the publication of newspapers. In May of this year, the Liaodong Daily was successfully re-published. In the past six months, news cadres in Jicha Jinliao and other places have also persisted in the struggle against the enemy with a heroic attitude. The business of the largest newspaper in the area, the Masses Daily, has gradually expanded, and its prestige has increased day by day. The Xinre Liao Bao in the eastern Rehe area has continuously improved its business in an extremely difficult environment behind enemy lines, and has been awarded commendations by the higher-level Party committee. The Ji Re Cha Bao in the Ji Re Cha area has been in a tense environment of frequent wars, insisting on publishing in northern Hebei, and has now exceeded one hundred issues. The West Manchuria Daily and the newspapers in the provinces and regions of Hejiang, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Mudanjiang, eastern Hebei, and Liaoji have all achieved results in reflecting the lives of the masses, exchanging local land reform experiences, and training news cadres, among which the New Heilongjiang Daily's writing is particularly easy to understand, and it has played a great role in educating emancipated farmers and training worker-peasant correspondents.
　　The publication of a large number of private newspapers and foreign language newspapers is a characteristic of the news undertaking in the Northeast Liberated Area. For example, in Harbin alone, there are the Harbin Gazette, Noon News, Harbin Industry and Commerce Daily, Dahua Daily, and Russian and Polish newspapers. Wangye Temple also has the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Newspaper, a national newspaper in Mongolian and Chinese.
　　The work of news agencies in the Northeast Liberated Area is also gradually being improved. Now, under the Northeast General Branch of the Xinhua News Agency, there are five branch offices in West Manchuria, Liaodong, Jilin, Ji Cha Re Liao, and eastern Hebei, and eight sub-branch offices. After the Democratic Allied Forces withdrew from Xinglong in September last year, the Redong Sub-branch moved into the mountains and forests with an area of more than seventy miles, and insisted on spreading the news of victory while living on extremely scarce cornmeal and vegetable paste, and helping the masses prepare for war and cultivate the land. Xinhua News Agency special correspondents Liu Baiyu, Yang Geng, Hua Shan, and other military reporters have successively interviewed with the army over the years, lived with the soldiers on the front line, and completed reporting tasks. The field branch of the Democratic Allied Forces' corps has also been established one after another. Dozens of military newspapers published by the headquarters' Self-Defense Daily and various divisions and regiments can promptly introduce combat experience and commend heroic models, which are extremely popular among the vast number of commanders and fighters. In addition to the re-establishment of Andong, the voices of Harbin, Jiamusi, Mudanjiang, Yanji and other radio stations have been broadcast daily for many years, and are familiar to many listeners at home and abroad.

　　东北新闻事业
    一年来东北解放区新闻事业已拥有二十余家大小报纸，十五个新华通讯社分支社，七家口语广播电台，千余名新闻工作者以及广大通讯员。在爱国自卫战争、土地改革及解放区各种生产建设中作了伟大的贡献。
    东北日报现有三百多新闻干部，已逐渐成为全东北解放区在政治上，思想上，工作上的指导中心。南满新闻工作者于民主联军撤离安东及通化后，始终坚持长白山脉，展开对敌斗争，有的深入敌区及边沿区开展通讯工作，保持报纸的出版，今年五月终将辽东日报胜利复刊。冀察晋辽各地新闻干部在过去半年中，亦以英勇姿态坚持对敌斗争，该区最大报纸群众日报，业务已逐渐扩大，威信日高。热东地区新热辽报，曾在极端艰苦的敌后环境下不断改进业务，获得了上级党委的记功奖励。冀热察地区的冀热察报，一直处于战争频繁的紧张环境中，坚持在平北出版，现已逾百期。西满日报及合江、吉林、黑龙江、牡丹江、冀东及辽吉各省区报纸对反映群众生活，交流各地土改经验与培养新闻干部方面均有成绩，其中尤以新黑龙江报文字通俗，对于教育翻身农民及培养工农通讯员起了极大作用。
    大量民营报纸与外文报纸之出版，是东北解放区新闻事业的一个特点，如哈尔滨市一地即有哈尔滨公报、午报、哈尔滨工商日报、大华日报及俄文波兰文报等，王爷庙并有蒙汉文之民族性报纸内蒙古自治报。
    东北解放区的通讯社工作，亦逐渐建全。现在新华社东北总分社以下拥有西满、辽东、吉林、冀察热辽、冀东五个分社及八个支社。热东支社于去年九月民主联军撤离兴隆后，即迁入七十余里方圆的山林中，以极稀少之棒子面和野菜糊口，坚持传播胜利消息，并帮助群众备战与耕作。新华社特派记者刘白羽、杨赓、华山及各随军记者等年来逐次随军采访，与第一线将士共同生活，完成报导任务。民主联军各兵团野战分社亦次第成立，总部自卫报及各师团出版之数十种部队报纸，均能及时介绍作战经验，表扬英雄模范，极受广大指战员的欢迎。广播电台除安东恢复不久外，哈尔滨、佳木斯、牡丹江，延吉等电台的声音年来每日广播，已为国内外许多听众所熟悉。（新华社东北一日电）
