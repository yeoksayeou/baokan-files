    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th. Less than a month after Wedemeyer left China, American imperialists, under the guise of "advisors" and "experts," have begun to implement a comprehensive plan to supervise and control various departments of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang to subjugate China. According to a TASS dispatch from Nanjing on the 18th, citing a report in the Nanjing Cheng Bao (transliteration): American advisors began working in various departments of the (Chiang bandit) Ministry of National Defense on September 11th. The report pointed out that the American advisory group originally had several teams, whose task was to coordinate their activities with various departments of the (Chiang bandit) Ministry of National Defense. However, this was a separate group. This relationship has now changed, and the advisors are now working directly in the (Chiang bandit) Ministry of National Defense. The report continued to state that after Christmas (December 25th), the United States will begin assisting in the training of Kuomintang troops in Taiwan. In addition, according to a Central News Agency special dispatch from New York on the 18th, Roscoe Pound, Dean of Harvard Law School, is scheduled to arrive in China on the 19th "to serve as an advisor to (Chiang's) Minister of Judicial Administration, Xie Guansheng, and be responsible for revising and reforming the Chinese legal code." It should be noted that prior to this, on August 22nd, Arthur N. Young, an American financial expert, had already arrived in Shanghai to serve as an advisor to the Chiang bandit Central Bank's "Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee."
