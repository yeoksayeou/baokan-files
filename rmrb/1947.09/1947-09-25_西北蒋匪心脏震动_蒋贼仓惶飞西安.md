Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 23rd. According to an Associated Press dispatch from Nanjing on the 21st, Chiang Kai-shek flew to Xi'an, a strategic location in the Northwest, on the 20th for a one-day "trip". It is widely believed that Chiang Kai-shek's hurried flight to Xi'an is clearly related to the serious military crisis currently facing the Northwest Chiang bandits. The Northwest People's Liberation Army has repeatedly intercepted fleeing Hu bandits in the vicinity of the Yan'an area, and the enemy's entire front has collapsed. The troops of Chen Geng and others in western Henan liberated Bao County, Guanzhong on the 12th, and after liberating Shan County on the 17th, they have directly knocked on the important gateway to Xi'an, the heart of the Northwest Chiang bandits. The prestige has reached the point where the entire Guanzhong region is shaken. According to a United Press reporter's dispatch from Nanjing on the 19th, "Martial law has been declared throughout Shaanxi Province." Wherever Chiang Kai-shek flies to, his bad luck follows him.

    西北蒋匪心脏震动
    蒋贼仓惶飞西安
    【新华社陕北二十三日电】据美联社二十一日南京消息：蒋介石于二十日曾飞赴西北战略要地西安作一日之“旅行”。众信蒋介石此次慌忙飞赴西安，显系与西北蒋匪目前所遭遇的严重军事危机有关。西北人民解放军于密迩延安地区一再截击溃逃胡匪，敌整个战线陷土崩瓦解局面，而豫西陈赓等蒋军所部大军，于十二日解放宝，关中，十七日解放陕县之后，已直叩西北蒋匪心脏西安重要门户的天险，声威所至，三秦震动。据合众社记者十九日自南京报导称：此时“陕西全省都已宣布戒严”。蒋介石飞到那里，他的倒霉也跟到那里。
