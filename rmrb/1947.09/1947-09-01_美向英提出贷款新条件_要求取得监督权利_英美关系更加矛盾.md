　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 29th. London Dispatch: According to a report from the New York correspondent Birch of the News Chronicle, the United States has recently proposed one of its new loan conditions to Britain, similar to the new loan conditions that Wedemeyer proposed to Chiang Kai-shek in China: that is, demanding the right to "supervise" the use of the loan. The reporter stated: "The United States opposes investing dollars in any nationalized industries that they deem ineffectively managed and demands supervision over the use of the loan." The reporter also stated that the United States had suggested sending coal experts to Britain. Britain is "determined not to accept additional dollars with many 'strings' attached. This is a very important contradiction and will entangle Anglo-American relations in the near future."
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 29th. New York Dispatch: Mrs. Manning, a British Labour Party MP who arrived in the United States from Britain on the 24th for a six-week speaking tour, stated at a press conference here that, in her prediction, if the United States requires Britain to relax its nationalization plan in order to provide further assistance to Britain, it will definitely cause strong resistance from all political groups in Britain; because this will be widely regarded as interference in British internal affairs. Mrs. Manning also stated that rumors that the United States intends to loan Franco a large sum of money and intends to build a huge air force base in Spain have shocked many British people.

　　美向英提出贷款新条件
  　要求取得监督权利
  　英美关系更加矛盾
    【新华社陕北二十九日电】伦敦讯：据此间新闻纪事报所载该报驻纽约记者柏奇日前的报导，美国最近提出对英新的贷款条件之一，一如魏德迈向中国蒋介石所提之新贷款条件：即要求取得“监督”贷款用途的权利。该记者称：“美国反对将美元投资到他们认为管理无效的任何国有化的工业中，而要求监督贷款的使用”。记者并称，美国曾建议派遣煤众专家赴英。而英国则“决心不接受另外附有许多‘束缚’的美元，这是一个很重要的矛盾，并将使最近将来的英美关系纠缠不清”。
    【新华社陕北二十九日电】纽约讯：二十四日由英抵美作六周旅行演说之英工党议员曼宁夫人，顷在此间招待记者会上称：据她预测，如美国要英国工业放松国有化计划，才更进一步援助英国，定会引起英国一切政治集团的强烈反抗；因为这会被普遍地认为是对英国内政的干涉。曼宁夫人并称：传闻美国拟大量贷款佛朗哥，并拟在西班牙建筑巨大空军基地，许多英国人对这极为震惊。
