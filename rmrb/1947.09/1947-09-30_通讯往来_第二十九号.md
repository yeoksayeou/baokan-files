    Correspondence

    No. 29

    Comrade Sun Jun of the Anyang Office!

    It is good that you are closely monitoring the current reports on protecting the autumn harvest in the border areas. In addition to organizing existing materials from the county's small newspapers, it is hoped that you will combine this with the current great counter-offensive propaganda campaign. Focus on reflecting the new facts and experiences of our army and people, inspired by the victory of the counter-offensive, launching a mass political offensive against the isolated islands occupied by Chiang, disintegrating the enemy and puppets, and protecting the land and distributing the autumn harvest. In reflecting the guerrilla warfare of encircling the enemy, it is hoped that you can also closely link it with the current situation of the great counter-offensive, reflecting the spirit of our army and people bravely killing the enemy. Comrade Liu Cun of Lucheng:

    This year, you have continuously reported on the exemplary reports of the two heroes, Liang Ma Dou, leading the masses to develop production and become rich, establishing a production banner. This is of great significance. With the arrival of the autumn harvest, please make a summary of the achievements of the peasants in Licun Gou who have turned over and "followed Liang Ma Dou" and "turned the poor ditch into a rich ditch", and concretely reflect the situation. We look forward to it! To the Changzhi Office and fellow correspondents:

    Your county is vigorously organizing men, women, and auxiliary laborers to participate in the autumn harvest and autumn plowing, ensuring early cleaning of the land and threshing grounds. Please provide continuous reports on the scale, achievements, and experiences and lessons learned, whether successful or unsuccessful, of the autumn harvest, autumn plowing, and autumn wheat campaigns. It is also hoped that you will focus on reflecting the situation of the army, martyrs' families in terms of substitute harvesting and cultivation and the establishment of household affairs, focusing on typical figures!
      
      The Editorial Department Correspondence Section

    第二十九号
    安阳办公室孙军同志！
    你们密切注意当前边地保卫秋收报导很好，除了组织县小报现有材料外，希结合当前大反攻宣传攻势，集中反映我军民在反攻胜利鼓舞下，向蒋占孤岛展开群众性政治攻势，瓦解敌伪，保田分秋的新事实与经验，在反映围困敌人游击战争方面，希亦能与当前大反攻形势密切联系起来，反映我军民奋勇杀敌的气概。潞城柳村同志：
    今年你们连续报导双英雄梁马斗领导群众生产发家，树立生产旗帜典型报导方法，意义很大，秋收到来，请把李村沟翻身农民，“跟上梁马斗”“把穷沟变成富沟”的情形，作出成绩总结具体反映为盼！长治办公室及通讯员同志：
    你县正大力组织男女、辅劳参加秋收、秋耕做到提早地净、场光，对于秋收、秋耕、秋麦运动规模、成绩与成功或失败的经验教训，均请作连续的报导。对军、烈属的代收代耕与建立家务情形，亦希抓住典型人物集中反映！
