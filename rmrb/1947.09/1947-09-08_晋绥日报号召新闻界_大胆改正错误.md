Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, 5th: Jin-Sui Daily and the Jin-Sui Xinhua Main Branch published an editorial on "September 1st" entitled "More Humbly, More Bravely, and More Thoroughly Expose and Correct Errors," calling on journalists to continue to use a solemn spirit of self-criticism to more deeply examine and expose errors. The editorial pointed out: Many comrades whose errors have been exposed have openly and seriously conducted self-criticism and self-examination to the readers. However, there are still a few comrades who, to this day, are unable to bravely admit the errors that have been exposed to the readers, and some refuse to publicly examine themselves or make statements to the Party newspaper under various pretexts. This shows that there are still stumbling blocks on the road of advancing the "Keli Kong" movement. The editorial emphasized: The exposure of untrue news and "Keli Kong" does not distinguish between leaders, editors, authors, reporters, and correspondents. Openly exposing errors is for the sake of improving work. Some people have mentioned the need to prevent using "Keli Kong" to oppose "Keli Kong." This is not something to worry about. Our exposure of errors is to be responsible to the people. When exposing the errors of others, we must adopt the principle of "curing the sickness to save the patient" and adopt a serious and responsible attitude. Comrades whose errors have been exposed should adopt the attitude of "correcting mistakes if we have them, and being encouraged if we don't." We should not avoid seeking medical treatment for fear of illness. We must also resolutely expose and criticize the mistakes of others. In our self-examination, we must trace the roots and examine whether our position is wholeheartedly on the side of the peasants? Have we severed all ties with the landlords? Are there still personal plans? Have we devoted ourselves to studying and striving to be proficient in our own work? Have we adopted a pragmatic, meticulous, and precise style for news interviewing, writing, and editing? Have we completely eliminated bad habits such as hearsay, catching shadows, and being overambitious? Only in this way can we advance the anti-"Keli Kong" movement to victory.

　　晋绥日报号召新闻界
  　大胆改正错误
    【新华社晋绥五日电】晋绥日报及晋绥新华总分社于“九一”节以“更虚心更勇敢更彻底的揭露以改正错误”为题发表社论，号召新闻工作者继续以严正的自我批评精神，更深入的检查与揭发错误。社论指出：许多被揭露过错误的同志已公开严肃的向读者进行了自我批评与检讨。可是，还有少数同志直到今天还不能勇敢向读者承认已被揭露的错误，有的则借口各种理由拒绝公开向党报进行检讨或声明。这说明在检举“客里空”运动的前进路上，还存在着绊脚石。社论强调：揭露不真实新闻与“客里空”是不分领导、编辑、作者、记者和通讯员的，公开揭发错误，是为了改进工作。有人提到要防止以“客里空”反对“客里空”，这是不必顾虑的，我们揭露错误，是对人民负责。在揭发别人错误的时候，必须是抱“治病救人”的方针，采取严肃负责的态度；而被揭露了错误的同志，则应抱“有则改之，无则加勉”的态度，不应讳疾忌医，对别人的错误也要坚决负责揭露与批评。在检讨中，必须追根检讨我们的立场是否全心全意站在农民方面？是否和地主割断了一切联系？是否还有个人打算？对本身的业务是否埋头钻研力求精通？对于新闻采访写作和编辑是否采取了实事求是，细致精确的作风？是否完全革除了道听途说捕风捉影，好高骛远等的坏作风？只有这样，我们才能把反“客里空”运动推进到胜利。
