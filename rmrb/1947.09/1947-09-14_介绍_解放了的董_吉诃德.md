Introducing "Don Quixote Liberated"
Wang Chun
Lu Lunacharsky, translated by Qu Qiubai, with a postscript by Lu Xun, published by Xinhua Bookstore

According to Mr. Lu Xun in his "Postscript" to this book, the original book was printed in 1922. "That was six years after the October Revolution, when all sorts of rumors against the Soviet Union were rampant, trying their best to slander it; those who revered the spirit, loved freedom, and advocated humanity were mostly dissatisfied with the autocracy of the party members, thinking that the revolution not only could not revive the world, but had turned into hell. This play is the general answer to these theorists." Mr. Lu Xun's concise introduction has indeed clearly stated the purpose of this book. That is, this book is the general answer to "many thinkers and writers who criticized the October Revolution"; and we are introducing this book to everyone to give a general answer to many comrades who are shouting "terrible" at today's mass movement.

What do these comrades say? Their thoughts, represented by Don Quixote in this book, said for them: "One should use the love of the new world to fight against the violence of the old world. Now... you are the violent ones, and they are the oppressed... It is you yourselves who want to be like the autocratic demons, not me who is saying this to you." And how does the author answer? The revolutionary leader Derigo answers Don Quixote like this: "Yes, we are autocratic demons, we are dictators. Look at this sword—see it?—it is as accurate in killing people as the nobles' swords; but their swords kill people for the sake of the slave system, and our swords kill people for the sake of freedom. It is difficult to change your old head. You are a good person, and good people always like to help the oppressed. Now, we are the oppressors in this short period. You fight with us. We must also fight with you, because our oppression is for the sake of ensuring that no one in this world can oppress anyone soon." Mr. Lu Xun said: "This is a very clear dissection." Then, we don't need to say anything more.

From our studies, we know that besides the Derigo type of person, there are also the ghosts of three people in this book lurking dimly in our camp. One is Don Quixote, because, as mentioned above, he advocates "using the love of the new world to fight against the violence of the old world"; his "conscience" says, oppose the revolution! Because they are too inhumane! Although Derigo told him: "I have no time to listen to this nonsense. The war for the greatest happiness is going on, and we must win and suppress the enemy, otherwise, the enemy will defeat us and our hopes. Everything is for victory! Let the weak-willed go to hell, or go to see God. The nobility and the common people cannot forgive each other. It is either water or fire; it is either us or them." However, this is useless, and Quixote eventually rolls over to the counter-revolutionary side; and he does so based on his "conscience," or, in the words of Baratassa criticizing him, his "most charitable and benevolent thoughts"! And these "thoughts," this "conscience," this "humanitarianism," are abundant in our ranks! We always hope that everyone will not eventually become a "weak-willed person" or a Don Quixote-style "good person," ruining the revolution.

Another is Baratassa mentioned in this book, who is Derigo's assistant and the second revolutionary leader; however, he also has weaknesses: his background is an intellectual, as Mr. Lu Xun said, he "still loves Quixote, is willing to vouch for him, and insists on being his friend"; finally, when facts prove to Don Quixote that he has caused great disaster for the revolutionary people, even Quixote himself feels that it is better to leave, but he still reluctantly says: "I pity you, Don Quixote. Maybe, I will risk vouching for you." This means that he wants to be Quixote's guarantor, letting him stay in the revolutionary ranks, as long as Quixote no longer expresses that terrible "compassion"; however, Quixote does not agree, Quixote says, I cannot guarantee that I will not "save people" again. Precisely because Baratassa has this intellectual's unique characteristics of "being considerate of others," "forgiving people's motives," etc., he is seen through by the counter-revolutionary organizer Moore, who says that he is a "student," "without backbone"; and the realization of the counter-revolutionary conspiracy is precisely achieved by attacking from this weakness! We must never let ourselves go without examination; the higher a person's IQ and cultivation, even it can be said that the more familiar a person is with "theory," the bigger this hole in him will be; "far less 'mechanical' than the peasants, but in those people's eyes, the peasants are also 'stubborn,' and it is impossible to open up a 'leak'."

The third is Miss Stella in this book. This princess will not come over to our side, but rather we have her masses here! She is the representative of the "charitable figures" of the ruling class (what is called "kind" landlords in the land reform) that some of our comrades are thinking about. When the counter-revolutionary plotter Moore mistreats Quixote, she sympathizes with Quixote, and she also sympathizes with many oppressed people, sympathizing with "inferiors"; she scolds Moore, scolding their lives as the lives of beasts, and she cannot stand their atrocities to the point of fainting several times. However, she later married Moore, and she wants to do everything for the existence of her own class—we specifically point out these three people, hoping that our fellow readers will compare themselves and be vigilant, and examine themselves.

The play is written well, and there is no need to say more. And more importantly, the thoughts and actions of these characters are all naturally developed, they had to be like that, and could only be like that. For example, Don Quixote's participation in the counter-revolutionary conspiracy, in his own words, was really just doing things that his own "conscience" dictated to him, and he did not intend to unite with the counter-revolution; so when Derigo asked him: Do you intend to "oppose us together with the aristocratic bandits?" he still said: "Even if I am alone, I must oppose all violence." This is the truth, it comes from his "self-confidence," he is overly "confident" that he will not cooperate with the counter-revolution; however, he does not understand what is called "the inevitability of objective development." The author neither forgives his actual counter-revolutionary behavior, nor falsely accuses him of deliberately doing evil, or willingly surrendering to evil people. But only in this way is the lesson to us greater, and we must estimate the reliability of this "self-confidence" lower, so as not to become sinners of the people and still be unrepentant until death.

According to Mr. Lu Xun, he translated the first act of this play; the second act and after were continued by Comrade Qu Qiubai; later, Comrade Qiubai also revised and translated the first act, and the entire manuscript was given to Mr. Lu Xun for a year. In the then Jiang-controlled area, it was of course impossible to publish it. Later, it was finally printed, and he specially wrote a postscript, but in the full text of the postscript, he had to avoid mentioning the name of Comrade Qu Qiubai. This article is now copied from the complete works of Lu Xun and attached to the end of the book.

The author, Lunacharsky, was the late Soviet People's Commissar for Education, and Comrade Qu Qiubai was one of the great leaders of the Chinese Communist Party who sacrificed himself. Taking their book as a reference for our class examination, stance examination, and thought examination today, and using it as a mirror for us to reflect on ourselves, is the most appropriate thing to do.

　　介绍“解放了的董·吉诃德”
    王春
    卢那察尔斯基著  瞿秋白译  鲁迅后记新华书店发行
    据鲁迅先生在给此书写的“后记”里面讲，原书是以一九二二年印行的。那“正是十月革命后六年，世界上盛行着反对苏联的种种谣诼，竭力企图中伤的时候；崇精神的，爱自由的，讲人道的，大抵不平于党人的专横，以为革命不但不能复兴人间，倒是得了地狱。这剧本便是给与这些论者们的总答案。”鲁迅先生这几句简明的介绍，的确已经把这书的宗旨说得清楚。就是这书是给与“许多非议十月革命的思想家、文学家”的总答案；而我们介绍大家都来读这本书，也是为的给予许多对今天的群众运动叫唤“糟得很”的同志们做一个总答案。
    这些同志们怎么讲呢？他们的思想代表董·吉诃德在这书上替他们说过了：“应当用新世界的慈爱，去对抗旧世界的强暴。现在………你们是强暴的人，而他们是被压迫者了。……………这是你们自己要和专制魔王一样，不是我来说你们的。”而著者是怎样答复呢？革命领袖德里戈是这样回答董·吉诃德：“是的，我们是专制魔王，我们是专政的，你看这把剑——看见吧？——它和贵族的剑一样，杀起人来是很准的；不过他们的剑是为着奴隶制度去杀人，我们的剑是为着自由去杀人。你的老脑袋要改变是很难的了。你是个好人，好人总喜欢帮助被压迫者。现在，我们在这个短期间是压迫者。你和我们来斗争吧。我们也一定要和你斗争，因为我们的压迫，是为着要叫这个世界上很快就没有人能够压迫。”鲁迅先生说：“这是解剖得十分明白的。”那么，我们也就用不着再来多说什么了。
    从学习中间，我们知道了除了德里戈型的人物，也还有这书上的三个人的鬼魂是在我们的阵营内若明若暗的徘徊着。一个就是董·吉诃德，因为如上所说，他主张“用新世界的慈爱，去对抗旧世界的强暴”；他的“良心”说，反对革命吧！因为他们太不人道！虽然德里戈给他讲了：“我没有功夫听这些废话。为着最伟大的幸福的战争正在进行着，要胜利，要镇压敌人，不然，敌人就要打倒我们和我们的希望。一切都为着胜利！意志薄弱的人，请他们去见鬼好了，或者去见上帝好了。贵族和平民不能够互相饶恕的。不是水，就是火；不是我们，就是他们。”然而这也没有用，吉诃德到底还是滚到反革命那边去；而他那样作，却是一本着他的“良心”，或者用巴拉塔萨批评他的话说，那叫做他的“最慈善的最仁爱的念头”！而这“念头”，这“良心”，这种“人道主义”，我们的队伍中却竟有的是！我们总希望大家不至于终究做一个“意志薄弱的人”，或者做一个董·吉诃德式的“好人”，给革命坏下事。
    另一个就是这书里提到的巴拉塔萨，他是德里戈的助手，是第二革命领袖；然而他也有弱点：他的出身是个智识分子，就如鲁迅先生所说，他“始终还爱着吉诃德，愿意给他去担保，硬着做他的朋友”；最后，当事实给董·吉诃德证明自己替革命的人民造下了大祸的时候，连吉诃德自己也感到只有走开的好了，而他却还依依恋恋的这样说：“我可怜你，董·吉诃德。也许，我来冒险担保你吧。”意思是说他想做吉诃德的保人，让他还留在革命队伍里，只要吉诃德再不发那种可怕的“慈悲”；然而吉诃德不，吉诃德说，我不能保证我自己再不“救人”。就因为巴拉塔萨有这种智识分子特有的“会替人设想”、“会原谅人的动机还好”等等特点，所以就被反革命的组织家谟尔却识透了，说他是“学生子”，“没骨头”；而反革命阴谋之得以实现，也就正是打从他这个弱点突击进去的！我们绝不可放过自己不去审查，越是智商修养高的人，甚至可以说越是“理论”讲得熟的人，他身上的这个洞子就越大；“远不象农民那样‘机械’，但在那些人看来，农民却也‘死硬’，挖不开‘漏口’。
    第三个是这书上的斯德拉小姐，这位公主倒不至于会跑到我们这边来，而是说我们这里有着他的群众！她就是我们一些同志所念念不忘的统治阶级的“慈善人物”（在土改中就是所谓“善”老财）的代表。当反革命的主谋者谟尔却作践吉诃德的时候，她同情吉诃德，她也同情许多被压迫者，同情“下人”；她骂谟尔却，骂他们的生活是野兽的生活，她看不惯他们的兽行几至于晕死了好几回。然而她后来和谟尔却结了婚，她要为她自己的阶级的存在而干出一切——我们特别指出这三个人来，希望读者同志们对照自己来警惕一番，检点一番。
    剧本写的好，是不需要多嘴说什么的。而更重要的则是他的这些人物的思想行动，都是自然发展下去的，是不得不那样，而且只能那样的。即如董·吉诃德之参加反革命阴谋，在他自己说来，也实在只是在做他自己的“良心”所支配着他的事情，并没有安心和反革命联合；所以当德里戈问他：你打算“同着贵族的匪徒一块儿来反对我们吗”的时候，他还是这样说：“我就算只有一个人，可是，一定要反对一切强暴。”他这话，是真话，是出于他的“自信”，他过分“自信”他不会和反革命合作；然而他不懂得什么唤做“客观发展的必然”。作者既不饶恕他实际的反革命行为，但也不冤枉他说他居心作恶，或者甘心投降恶人。但是惟有这样，才对我们的教训意义更大，我们千万也要把这种“自信”的可靠性估计得低一些，免得做了人民的罪人而还至死不悟。
    据鲁迅先生说，这剧本第一场他曾译过；第二场以后是瞿秋白同志续译的；后来秋白同志又连第一场也改译了，全稿交鲁迅先生放了一年，在当年的蒋管区，当然没法出版。后来总算印出来了，他又特别写了一篇后记，但在后记全文上，还不得不避开瞿秋白同志的名字不谈。现将此文从鲁迅全集内抄出，附在书后。
    著者卢那察尔斯基，是已故苏联人民教育委员长、瞿秋白同志是中国共产党牺牲了的伟大领导者之一，拿他们这本书，作我们今天查阶级、查立场、查思想的参考读物，用作我们反省自己的一面镜子，这是最恰当没有的。
