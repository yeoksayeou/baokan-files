[Report from our newspaper in Southern Hebei on the 17th] Various areas in Southern Hebei are continuing to eliminate pests during the autumn harvest to protect the harvest. In Weixian County's Fourth District, over ten thousand sparrows were caught in ten days. In Jingxian County's Second District, 180,000 "big-eyed thieves" (a type of insect) were caught in three days. In Enxian County's Third District, rice seedlings were infested with locust nymphs, but they were completely eliminated in five days, saving 34,000 mu of seedlings. In Yixian County's Fourth District, over 4,000 pigeons were also mobilized to be killed. The masses in Shu Jin and Bocun, Zaoqiang County, said, "Big-eyed thieves are like landlords, they are all parasites." A cadre in Dong Dongli Village, Guangzong County, called on the masses, saying, "Bring out the energy you used to fight Chiang Kai-shek to catch big-eyed thieves, because they are going to kick away our rice bowls." Other areas have eliminated mole crickets, sparrows, and house mice in the thousands and tens of thousands, showing the masses' extremely high enthusiasm for eliminating pests. Recently, armyworm infestations were discovered in the first and second districts of Jize County, the fifth district of Yongnian County, the fifth district of Feixiang County, and the first and third districts of Cheng'an and Ci counties. The masses call them "sticky worms," which resemble silkworms, have red heads, and turn black when they grow up. When Jize County called for their elimination, some people thought it was "Heaven's will" or "divine worms," and the more they tried to eliminate them, the more there were. Others were afraid of trampling on the crops, and some said, "We don't have them in our fields, and as soon as we catch them, they run to our fields!" After careful calculation, it was pointed out that "eliminating pests is protecting our rice bowls, and superstition is harming ourselves!" Therefore, a total mobilization of manpower was implemented. The county magistrates of Jize and Yongnian personally led the masses. An old lady in Xizhuang said, "I used to burn incense and kowtow to the worms, but the more I did, the more there were. Now I don't burn incense and I've finished them off." A village cadre in Southwest Village, Cheng'an County's First District, called on the masses, saying, "Our village's harvest is not bad this year. We're about to get the food in our mouths, but now the worms are stealing it from us. Do you think the worms eating the crops will lead to a lean year? Are we fighting the worms or not? In the past, before liberation, everyone was unlucky when there were pests. Can we do that this year?" After everyone discussed it, they unanimously expressed their determination to mobilize for a total elimination of pests. Men did not do business, women did not spin cotton, and adults and children all worked together. Seven or eight tenths of all infested land has already been eliminated. In Nangong County, the worms on ten qing of land were wiped out in three days. In the third sub-district of the third district of Cheng'an and Ci counties, there were many worm eggs on the rice leaves in each village, so they launched a campaign to remove the rice leaves. The worm eggs on twenty-six qing of land in Liu Ganzhuang and other three villages have been eliminated.
