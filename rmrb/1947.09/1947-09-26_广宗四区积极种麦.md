    Guangzong Fourth District Actively Plants Wheat
    [Our newspaper reporter group, 24th dispatch] This year, wheat planting in Guangzong Fourth District accounts for one-third of the 76,850+ mu of land currently under cultivation in the district. At present, farmers have plowed and harrowed all the wheat planting land (sun-dried wheat land three or four times, autumn stubble land twice), and most of the fertilizer has also been delivered. The farmers in Nan Sanlizhuang have done a good job in preparing for wheat planting and are currently catching mole crickets and drying wheat seeds. The masses in Zhao Jiazhai used loans to open flour mills, accumulated more than 150 cartloads of fertilizer, enough fertilizer for 150+ mu of land, enabling 45 newly emancipated farmers to plant more than 650 mu of wheat. The village cadres first lent their own livestock to farmers without labor to plow and harrow the land, influencing other households with cattle, and calling on the masses to freely combine and help each other plant wheat. With mutual help, all 1,100 mu of wheat land in the village was plowed and harrowed, and fertilizer was delivered to the fields. The masses in the brick kiln who had no livestock voluntarily organized to pull plows, saying, "If we plant one more mu this year, we will harvest one hundred more jin next year, and we will never go hungry again!" The village currently cultivates more than 4,200 mu of land, and this year, wheat planting will reach more than 50%. Currently, only a small amount of fertilizer remains to be delivered to the fields. (Zhu Bo)

    广宗四区积极种麦
    【本报记者团二十四日电】广宗四区今年种麦，占该区现种地七万六千八百五十余亩的三分之一，目前农民将全部种麦地犁耙完（晒麦地三、四遍，秋茬地二遍），大部肥料也都已送完。南三里庄农民种麦准备工作做好，目前正在捉蝼蛄，晒麦种。赵家寨群众以贷款开粉坊，积肥一百五十余车，净有一百五十余亩地的肥料，使四十五户新翻身农民能种六百五十多亩麦子。该村村干部先将自己的牲口借给无劳力的农民犁耙地，来影响其他有牛户，并号召群众自由结合互助种麦。该村在互相帮助下，一千一百亩麦地全部犁耙掉了，肥料也都送到地里。砖窑无牲口群众自动组织起来拉犁，他们说：“今年多种一亩，明年多收一百斤，再也不会挨饿了！”该村现种地四千二百多亩，今年种麦到百分之五十以上，现在仅剩少数的肥料未送到地里。（朱波）
