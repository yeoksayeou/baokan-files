    In accordance with the Treaty of Peace with Italy
    Southern Troops Enter Southern Two Districts
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 21st] Belgrade dispatch: Yugoslav troops began moving into the Istria and Slovenia regions on the 15th, the day the Treaty of Peace with Italy went into effect, to take over the defense duties of the American and British occupation forces. They entered the city of Pula on the 15th and completed the entire takeover on the 16th. The people of both countries cheered and welcomed the Southern troops, with Yugoslav flags and portraits of Tito hanging everywhere in the cities and villages, and mass rallies were held. The Southern Ministerial Conference, at Tito's request, has allocated special funds for the reconstruction of the two regions. Yugoslavia has thus increased its territory by 7,400 square kilometers and its population by 500,000.

    依照对意和约规定
    南军进驻南部两区
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】贝尔格莱德讯，南斯拉夫军队已于十五日对意和约生效日起运驻伊斯特里雅区及斯洛文尼亚区，接替美英占领军防务，十五日开入波拉城，十六日完成全部接收，两国人民夹道欢呼，迎接南军，城市乡村遍悬南斯拉夫国旗及铁托肖像，并纷纷举行群众大会。南部长会议应铁托之请，已拨特别款项为复兴两区之用。南斯拉夫因此已增加领土七千四百平方公里及人口五十万人。
