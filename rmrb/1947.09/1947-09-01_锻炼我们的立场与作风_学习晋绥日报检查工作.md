Cultivating Our Standpoint and Style
    Learning from the *Jin Sui Daily* Inspection Work
    Xinhua General News Agency Editorial Department

    The main distinguishing feature between the people's news undertaking and the reactionary class news undertaking is standpoint and style. Our standpoint is to serve the people, first and foremost the workers, peasants, and soldiers who constitute the vast majority of the population. Our style is to seek truthfulness, that is, to tell the people the truth about things; it is to seek depth, that is, our news and commentary must be well-written, based on investigation, research, and analysis, and capable of explaining problems and solving problems for the people. This standpoint and this style are inseparable. Such a standpoint and such a style are what we have always advocated.

    After the War of Resistance Against Japan and the two years of struggle for peace and democracy, the people's news undertaking has developed into a powerful army. It is a powerful ideological combat weapon in the people's liberation movement. It has the largest circulation, the most widespread influence, and the fastest reflection, and is therefore most closely connected with the masses of the people. This army must be well-trained in order to effectively serve the people. In the current stage of domestic war and the great land reform movement, this weapon must be further strengthened to help the people defeat the enemy. In the past, various liberated areas have made some efforts to improve the work of the news army, and have already achieved some results, but there has been no public mass inspection work like that carried out by the *Jin Sui Daily* starting in late June. Therefore, the *Jin Sui Daily's* anti-"*Ke Li Kong*" movement this time is of historical significance in the construction of the people's news undertaking, and it is not only meaningful for Jin Sui, but also for other liberated areas.

    According to the initial inspection results of the *Jin Sui Daily* this time, on the one hand, it was discovered that there was a serious, irresponsible, and impractical "*Ke Li Kong*" style in news reporting and other links of news work; at the same time, what is more noteworthy is the discovery of the issue of class standpoint in news work. This is a major gain in the Jin Sui land reform. In the past, we have not only continuously carried out standpoint education in our news work, but also achieved very obvious results. But generally speaking, this mainly concerned the standpoint in the struggle against imperialism, big landlords, and the big bourgeoisie; less specific attention was paid to the standpoint in the relationship between peasants and landlords on the land issue. This is because in the past the land issue was limited to rent and interest reduction, and had not penetrated into the general equal distribution of land; on the other hand, the reason for this phenomenon is of course also related to the class origin of the members of our news army. The news army, which is mostly composed of petty-bourgeois intellectuals, can easily have a clear-cut standpoint in the struggle against imperialism, big landlords, and the big bourgeoisie; but in the relationship between peasants and landlords, some of them may have a blurred standpoint, because most petty-bourgeois intellectuals are related to the land. The fact that reporter Ai Bo described "landlords" as "middle peasants" and forced the masses to return the fruits of struggle requires us to be highly vigilant. We should be indignant at such people, and everyone should work hard to raise our news army's standpoint a step further.

    The *Jin Sui Daily* also inspected the following rather serious phenomena, namely, fabricating "heroic models" out of thin air in writing, hearsay in interviews, catching shadows based on wind, arbitrarily deleting and changing without basis in editing work, and carelessness in translation, telegraphic editing, and proofreading. This kind of non-serious and non-refined style is an extremely bad style. The ideological source of this bad style lies in the fact that some comrades are still diligently planning for personal reputation, status, power, treatment, interests, and other so-called "personal achievements," and are still unable to work wholeheartedly and down-to-earth for the people; another source is old habits. Some of the revolutionary petty-bourgeois intellectuals in the news army have brought with them the bad habits of the declining feudal class, such as arrogance, laziness, empty talk, complacency, and perfunctoriness, and are indifferent to the people's cause and lack enthusiasm. This kind of decadent, unpromising individualism and selfish habits have caused and are causing continuous losses to the people's news undertaking, and we must resolutely wage an irreconcilable struggle against it. Generally speaking, although the above phenomena do not occupy a dominant position in our news army, they are still very harmful to the people's cause. All of our news workers must realize that if we do not make up our minds to correct these shortcomings, we will decline and degenerate; in other words, we will become detached from the people. So, what should we do to transform ourselves? The *Jin Sui Daily* has already provided a preliminary correct method, which is to conduct public, mass, and thorough inspections. In the future, units, departments, and individuals that have done well should be publicly commended; those that have done badly should be publicly criticized and reprimanded, and should be urged by the masses to correct their mistakes; comrades who have conscientiously corrected their mistakes should be welcomed, and we should unite with them well; those who persist in their mistakes should be unreservedly removed from their posts until they are willing to correct their mistakes before they are reappointed. Some people may think that this will strike at cadres, but in fact this is the most effective way to care for cadres and educate cadres to truly progress. Because our news undertaking belongs to the people, and it is also often and openly meeting the people, if there are shortcomings in our ranks, it is like blemishes on a person's face, which are visible to everyone. Therefore, we must openly correct our mistakes in order to maintain the prestige of the people's news undertaking and its cadres among the people. There will be no real prestige if open errors cannot be openly corrected. There will still be prestige if open errors can be openly corrected.

    The news work units, departments, and individuals in all liberated areas should universally and thoroughly examine their own standpoints and styles in a public and mass way, and should launch a universal learning movement from this. Some people emphasize technical learning very much, but they must know that only on the basis of a correct standpoint and style can technology be meaningful to the people. Class standpoint is the foundation of everything. If the standpoint is correct, the style will truly become upright, and there will be a serious and responsible attitude, so as not to be careless and perfunctory; also, only then can we strive for refinement and carefully analyze, so as not to parrot others and be satisfied with half-baked knowledge. Only in this way can we regularly, resolutely, and soberly study and judge the enemy, and not be frightened by the enemy's false voices or deceived and blinded. Only in this way can we neither obliterate nor exaggerate our own achievements, and be less likely to be confused by false achievements. Only in this way can we have the true courage to face up to our own shortcomings, so as not to be numb and indifferent, and even less to whitewash peace and cover up defects.

    Our Party is already the Party on which all the hopes of the Chinese people are placed, the Party that has the power to determine the political situation in China, and the Party that already has a high prestige internationally. 330 million people in China have been liberated. As the mouthpiece of the Chinese Party and the Chinese people, the people's news undertaking and its staff should use this as a standard to carry out their own transformation.

　　锻炼我们的立场与作风
    学习晋绥日报检查工作
    新华总社编辑部
    人民的新闻事业区别于反动阶级新闻事业的主要标志，是立场与作风。我们的立场是为人民服务，首先为占人口最大多数的工农兵服务。我们的作风是求真实，就是以事情的真实情形告诉人民；是求精深，就是我们的新闻与评论必须写得好，经过调查、研究、分析，能够为人民解释问题与解决问题。这种立场与这种作风，两者是不能分离的。这样的立场，这样的作风，是我们向来所提倡的。
    经过抗日战争和两年来争取和平、民主的斗争，人民的新闻事业已发展成为一支强大的军队，它是人民解放运动中一个有力的思想战斗武器，它的发行最大量，影响最普遍，反映最迅速，因此与人民群众最密切。这一支军队必须练好，才能有效地为人民服务。在目前国内战争阶段与土地改革大运动中，更须加强这一武器，帮助人民战胜敌人。过去各解放区都曾作过一些改进新闻军的工作，而且已有若干成绩，但是如象晋绥日报六月下旬开始的这样公开地群众性的检查工作，则没有做过。所以晋绥日报这次的反对“客里空”运动，在人民新闻事业建设过程中是有历史意义的，而且不但对晋绥一地有意义，对其他解放区同样有意义。
    根据晋绥日报此次初步检查结果，一方面发现了新闻报导及新闻工作其他环节中有严重的、不负责任、不实际的“客里空”作风；同时更加值得注意的是发现了新闻工作中的阶级立场问题，这是晋绥土地改革中一大收获。过去我们新闻工作中不仅不断进行过立场教育，而且也已收到极明显的效果。但一般地说，这主要的是关于在反帝、反大地主、大资产阶级的斗争中的立场问题；在土地问题上农民与地主关系中的立场问题，则较少具体注意。这是因为过去土地问题还限于减租减息，没有深入到普遍的平分土地；另一方面所以有这种现象，当然还与我们新闻军的成员的阶级出身有关。绝大部分由小资产阶级知识分子组成的新闻军，在反帝、反大地主、大资产阶级的斗争中，立场很容易鲜明；而在农民与地主关系中，却有一部分立场会模糊，这是因为小资产阶级知识分子大半与土地有关。记者艾柏把“地主”说成“中农”，并强迫群众退还斗争果实，这一事实须要我们大加警惕。对于这种人，应有愤慨，大家努力把我们新闻军的立场锻炼提高一步。
    晋绥日报又检查出来了下列的相当严重的现象，即是写作上凭空制造“英雄模范”，采访上的道听途说，捕风捉影，编辑工作中的并无根据任意删改，译电校对等工作的马马虎虎等等。这种不认真，不精致的作风，是极坏的作风。产生这种坏作风的思想根源，在于有些同志还在兢兢于个人名誉、地位、权力、待遇、兴趣等所谓“个人成就”的打算，还不能全心全意脚踏实地地为人民工作；另外一个根源是旧习惯，新闻军里革命的小资产阶级知识分子中，有一些人还带来了没落的封建阶级那种自高、懒惰、清谈、苟且、敷衍等坏习惯，对于人民事业应付旁观，缺乏热情。这种没落的、没有前途的个人主义思想与自私的习惯，对于人民新闻事业造成了而且造成着不断的损失，须要我们坚决起来与之作不调和的斗争。上面这些的现象，一般地说，虽在我们新闻军中已不占统治地位，但仍大有害于人民事业的。我们全体新闻工作同志必须认识，如果我们不下决心改正这些缺点，我们就会下降，就会退化；换句话说，就会脱离人民。那么就要来进行改造呢？晋绥日报已经提供了初步的正确的方法，就是公开地、群众性地、彻底地进行检查。以后凡是作得好的单位、部门及个人，应受到公开的表扬；作得坏的，应受到公开的批评、指责，而且应以群众力量督促其非改正错误不可；认真改正了错误的同志，应受到欢迎，我们应当很好的团结他们；对于那些坚持错误的，应当毫无保留地撤消他们的职务，直到他们愿意改正错误时才再任用他们。也许有人以为这样会打击干部，其实这正是爱护干部，教育干部真正进步的最有效的方法。因为我们的新闻事业是属于人民的，而又是经常地公开地与人民相见的，我们的队伍中有缺点，好象人的脸上有污点，是人所共见的。因此必须公开改正错误，才能保持人民新闻事业及其干部在人民中的威信。有了公开错误不能公开改正，就不会有真正威信。有了公开错误能够公开改正，就仍然会有威信。
    各解放区的新闻工作单位、部门及个人，均应普遍在公开的群众性的方式下，彻底检查自己的立场与作风，要由此开展一个普遍的学习运动。有些人很强调技术学习，他们就必须知道只有在正确的立场与作风基础之上，技术对于人民才有意义。阶级立场是一切之本，立场正确了，作风才会真正正派起来，才能有认真负责的态度，不至于马虎从事、敷衍塞责；也才能力求精致、细心分析，不至于人云亦云，自满于一知半解。只有这样，才能经常坚决地清醒地研究敌人、判断敌人，不致被敌人虚声吓倒与欺骗蒙蔽。也只有这样，才能对我们自己的成绩既不抹煞，也不夸大，更不易为假成绩所迷惑。也只有这样，才能有真正的勇敢来正视我们自己的缺点，不至麻木不仁、熟视无睹，更不致粉饰太平，包庇缺陷。
    我们的党已经是中国人民一切希望所寄托，已经有力量决定中国政局的大党，在国际上已有很高的威信。中国已经有一万万三千万人民获得解放，作为中国党与人民耳目喉舌的人民新闻事业及其工作人员，应以此为标准来进行自己的改造。
