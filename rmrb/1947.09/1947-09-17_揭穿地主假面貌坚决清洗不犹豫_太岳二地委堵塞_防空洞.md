　　【Our Newspaper Taiyue, 15th dispatch】 The Taiyue CCP Second District Committee and the Second Administrative Office have resolutely blocked the landlords' "air-raid shelters" and have initially purged 37 targets of struggle. The Production Committee of the Second District Committee, from July 20th to August 10th, over 20 days, purged 37 targets of struggle from production units such as the joint store, flour mill, eatery, gristmill, and transport team, and handed them over to the masses for handling. At the beginning of the purge, many comrades had ideological difficulties. Some believed that these people were capable, and purging them would affect production; others believed that it would not be too late to hand them over when the masses demanded it; some even wanted to protect the landlords. The Production Committee steadfastly led discussions and inspections of operations. Some comrades only realized the truth after going to various places for investigation. For example, Zhou Jixing, the manager of the water mill, was a feudal force in Jianxia Village. In 1945, he served as the deputy village chief in Nanliang Village, Xiangling, and was corrupt, causing the masses to hate him to the bone. In order to escape the struggle by the masses, he participated in the production work of the organization. After becoming the manager of the water mill in April of this year, his accounts were unclear, and he embezzled 480 jin of white flour and over 600 jin of bran. Niu Mianzhang was a local tyrant from Xiacun Village, Yicheng. Also in order to escape struggle, he squeezed into the transport team to drive carts and make money by privately carrying goods. The masses had reported him to the organization several times, but he was never handed over. The other targets of struggle were either corrupt or organized small cliques to sow discord and carry out various acts of sabotage. After these targets of struggle were purged, the morale of the production personnel in each unit immediately improved. All cadres and personnel of the Second Administrative Office, in order to completely block the "air-raid shelters" of the landlord class, first conducted land reform studies, putting forward: (1) Studying the firm stance of the poor and hired peasants, and eliminating all feelings of pity for the landlords; (2) All staff members participate in the local mass movement to examine their own thoughts with the actions of the masses.

　　揭穿地主假面貌坚决清洗不犹豫
  　太岳二地委堵塞“防空洞”
    【本报太岳十五日电】太岳中共二地委与二专署，坚决堵塞地主“防空洞”，已初步清洗出斗争对象三十七人，二地委生产委员会自七月二十日起至八月十日二十天中，从联合商店、粉坊、饭坊与磨坊、运输队等生产单位中，清洗斗争对象三十七人，交给群众处理。在开始清洗时，很多同志思想上打不通，有的认为这些人能干，清洗了会影响生产；有的认为等群众要了，再给也不迟；甚至有的还想包庇地主。生委会坚定不移地领导着讨论与检查业务，一些同志在分赴各处调查后，才恍然大悟了，如水磨上的经理周继兴，是涧峡村的封建势力，三十四年曾在襄陵南梁村当村副，贪污腐化，群众恨之入骨，他为逃避群众斗争，才参加了机关生产工作，今年四月在水磨里当经理后，帐目不清，贪污白面四百八十斤，麸子六百余斤。牛绵章是翼城下村的恶霸，也是为逃避斗争，钻入运输队、赶车私带货物赚钱，群众曾向机关提出几次，均未交出。其他的斗争对象，不是贪污、便是组织小集团挑拨离间，进行种种破坏行为。这些斗争对象被清洗后，各单位生产人员情绪立刻提高。二专署全体干部人员，为彻底堵塞地主阶级“防空洞”，先进行土改学习，提出：（一）学习贫雇的坚定立场，取消对地主的一切怜悯心理；（二）全体工作人员皆参加驻地群众运动，以群众的行动来检查自己的思想。
