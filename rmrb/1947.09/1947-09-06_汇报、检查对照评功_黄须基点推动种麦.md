[Reported from the newspaper's Licheng office] The Huangxu base area in the Third District, consisting of five villages, held a meeting on August 27th attended by 57 cadres, male and female activists from the entire base. The meeting involved inspecting and summarizing weeding, arranging wheat planting. Each village left one responsible cadre at the base to report on the work of their village, while the rest participated in inspection teams, divided into five groups (about ten people per group), to inspect weeding, manure accumulation, plowing wheat fields twice, spinning, and weaving in each village. Then, based on the reports of each village and the inspection team reports, everyone was allowed to criticize and evaluate. As a result, Zaozhen was credited with great achievement. Regarding wheat planting, Zaozhen village organized typical households of emancipated peasants, such as Zheng Jincang, to formulate plans for increasing production, saving, and supporting the front lines. After explicit discussion in the poor peasant and tenant meetings, they united with middle peasants to formulate plans for accumulating manure, plowing wheat land twice, and expanding wheat fields to increase grain. Teams and squads issued competitive challenges, creating a movement. The entire village plans to plant 1161 mu of regular wheat this year. After inspecting manure piles, 28,470 loads of manure have been accumulated, an average of 24.3 loads per mu. They plan to convert 494 mu of stubble land to wheat. Xihuangxu was selected as second in weeding, earning two minor merits. In preparation for wheat planting, they first convened a meeting of poor peasants and hired laborers to assess their assets and estimate this year's harvest, realizing that there was a shortfall in increasing grain and that it was necessary to accumulate more manure, expand wheat fields, and increase grain production to concentrate efforts on supporting the front lines. They also discussed that after the drought in the first half of the year, there might be flooding in the second half, coupled with a leap year, and the early cool weather. From now until the White Dew Festival, there are only eleven days, a very short time. Half of the double-plowing of wheat land has not been completed, and most of the fertilizer has not been transported to the fields. They put forward the slogan: It is better to plant wheat early than late, plant wheat early, and the wheat will grow nine stalks (better to rush the drought than be late, if it's late the weather is cool and it comes out slowly, less wheat will be harvested). The entire village has 875.8 mu of regular wheat land, and 21,913 loads of manure have been accumulated, an average of 25 loads per mu. They plan to convert 216.5 mu of stubble land to wheat. Together with Shangzizhen, Changyuan, and Donghuangxu, the five villages have a total of 6058.7 mu of regular wheat, and 144,854 loads of manure have been accumulated, an average of 23.8 loads per mu. A total of 1836.8 mu are planned for conversion of stubble land. The entire base point has a unified plan: focus on continuing to accumulate manure, striving for 25 loads of manure per mu for regular wheat, and 15 loads of manure per mu for converted land; plow regular land three times, convert land once, complete the second plowing and transport all the manure within ten days before the White Dew Festival, plant 169 wheat varieties within five days after the festival, and complete planting regular wheat within the next ten days.

[Reported from the newspaper's Gaoyi office] At the cadre meeting of Zhang Village base point in the First District this month, after each village reported on production, mutual aid, thrift, preparations for famine, and the combination of labor and military affairs, the cadres did not trust each other and raised questions at the meeting, starting a debate. For example, Songjiazhuang reported that the Zhizhiping group in their village was good at production, implemented equal value exchange, and used distribution tickets. In drought resistance, all the women and children made a sudden attack to push water carts for ten days. There were two good spinning groups that often spun flowers together. In terms of thrift, some households in the village did not cook rice at noon and ate pumpkin tips. Hao Ming held a family meeting to discuss savings, and the whole family of five only ate 1.8 dou of wheat, 2 dou of sorghum, and 3 sheng of rice in two months. They also used a carpenter for a few days, saved the wheat they didn't eat, and sold it for more than 40,000 yuan to buy a donkey. At this point, cadres from Northwest Camp, East Taying, and other villages all agreed very much and suggested: This way, you can save several donkeys a year. The women's cadre from East Taying said anxiously: "People have said that production is mutually aided and women push water carts, but we can't say what our village has achieved." Therefore, everyone suggested: It's not enough to just talk, you have to look at the actual situation and conduct inspections. Inspection methods: One is mutual visits by the masses, and the other is that each village and system selects three people to form a unified inspection team at the base point. On the 27th, district cadres personally led the team to each village for inspection, and finally conducted discussions. At the evaluation meeting, it was unanimously agreed that Songjiazhuang was the best of the five villages in the entire base point. Just in terms of mutual aid and spinning, mutual aid was frequent, the organization was consolidated, there was a Hao Ming model group, and the masses dared to use cadres; other achievements were also obvious. Second was Wangjia Village, where the explosion movement had great results, with mines all over the streets and lanes, so that special agents could not enter the village. In addition, they gathered a lot of wild vegetables, and every family gathered them, with the roofs full of drying vegetables. The whole village has dried more than 2,000 jin of wild vegetables, and it is still ongoing. The achievements and shortcomings of other villages were also discussed one by one. This inspection had a great effect in promoting the movement. Everyone said: "The inspection is almost the same as what was talked about in the report." East Taying also suggested that they should work hard in the future, and if they could not become a model, they should not fall behind. (Song Cheng, Quan Ming, Zhen Yu)

　　汇报、检查对照评功
  　黄须基点推动种麦
    【本报黎城讯】三区黄须基点共五个村，于八月二十七日召开全基点干部男女积极分子五十七人会议，检查总结锄苗，布置种麦，除各村留一负责干部在基点汇报本村工作外，其余都参加了检查队，分五个小组（每组十人左右），赴各村检查锄苗、积肥、犁二犁麦田、纺织等工作，然后根据各村汇报，及检查队汇报对照，让大家批判评选，结果枣镇立了大功。关于种麦问题，枣镇村是组织对翻身农民郑进仓等典型户，订出增产、节约、支援前线刨老根计划，经贫佃会议明确讨论后，团结中农，订出积肥犁二犁麦地与扩大麦田增粮计划，组与组队与队提出竞赛挑战，造成运动。全村今年计划种正茬麦一千一百六十一亩，经过检查肥堆，已积肥二万八千四百七十驮，每亩平均二十四点三驮，准备改茬麦四百九十四亩。西黄须在锄苗上被选为第二，立了二小功，种麦准备上，首先召开了贫雇会，算家当，及估计今年收成，了解在增粮上是有了窟窿，必须多积肥，扩大麦田，多增粮，集中力量支援前线刨老根。又讨论前半年遭了旱灾，后半年可能再涝，再加以闰年，天凉早，从现在至白露节，仅十一天，时间很短，二犁麦地还有一半没犁，肥大部没运到地，提出口号：种麦宜直不宜晚，早点直麦，麦支九股（赶旱不赶晚，迟了天凉出的慢，少打麦）。全村正茬麦地八百七十五点八亩，已积肥二万一千九百十三驮，每亩平均二十五驮，计划改茬麦二百十六点五亩。连上子镇、长垣、东黄须五个村共正茬麦六千零五十八点七亩，已积肥十四万四千八百五十四驮，每亩平均二十三点八驮，共计划扩大改茬一千八百三十六点八亩。全基点统一计划：重点继续积肥，争取正茬麦每亩上二十五驮肥，改茬每亩上十五驮肥；正茬普遍犁三次，改茬犁一次，白露前十天犁完二犁，运完肥，交节后五天种完一六九小麦，后十天种完正茬麦。（安顺、富巧、有德、木林、飞龙）
    【本报高邑讯】本月中旬一区张村基点干部会议上，各村汇报生产互助节约备荒劳武结合后，各干部都互不相信，当会提出质问，展开争论。如宋家庄汇报他村生产数志平组好，实行了等价交换，使用分票，抗旱上全体妇女儿童突击推水车十天，纺织有两个好组，经常在一块纺花；节约上村里有些户晌午锅里不下米，吃南瓜尖，郝明开了家庭会，讨论省俭后，全家五口两个月只吃了一斗八升麦，二斗高粱，三升米，中间还用了几天木匠，省下麦子没吃，卖成四万多元买了个驴。至此，西北营、东塔影等村干部均甚赞成，提出意见说：这样一年能节约几个驴。东塔影妇女干部急的说：“人家生产互助，妇女推水车都说了，俺村有成绩就是说不出来。”由此大家提出：光说不算，要看实际，要进行检查。检查方法：一种是群众相互访问，一种是每村各系统共选三人，基点统一成立检查队。廿七号由区干部亲自带领到各村去检查，最后进行讨论，评议会上一致认为全基点五个村宋家庄最好，只互助纺织来说，互助经常，组织巩固，有郝明模范组，群众敢使用干部；其他成绩也很明显。其次是王家村爆炸运动成绩大，大街巷道遍地是雷，使特务不能进村，另外打野菜特别多，家家都打，房上晒满，全村已晒成干野菜两千多斤，现仍在进行。别村的成绩缺点也一一提出讨论，经过这次检查，作用很大，推动了运动，大家说：“检查后和汇报谈的差不多。”东塔影并提出今后要好好干，成不了模范也不能落后。（宋诚、全明、振玉）
