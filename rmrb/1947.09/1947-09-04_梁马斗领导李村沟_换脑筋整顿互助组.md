Liang Madou Leads Licun Gully
Changing Mindsets to Rectify Mutual Aid Teams
    Liang Madou led the masses of Licun Gully to rectify mutual aid teams. In eight days, they gained some experience:

    Large Account Settlement, Immediate Cash Payment
    The rectification of mutual aid in Licun Gully began with a large account settlement, clearing forty days of wartime service, and the unpaid wages of the preferential treatment for military dependents from spring to the present in the mutual aid teams over five months. Labor vouchers were issued for wartime service and preferential treatment for military dependents, which were quickly settled. However, the mutual aid team accounts were difficult to clear. Most teams had not settled accounts immediately from spring to the present. Some families had made immediate cash payments, while others had partially cleared their accounts through mutual exchange. Some teams hadn't even calculated at all, resulting in a muddled mess.

    Why hadn't the five-month period been settled and paid immediately? Everyone said, "Farmers all over the world are one family; it's unseemly to be too particular." Upon closer examination, the thoughts of each class were different: 1. Of the fourteen mutual aid teams, eight team leaders were middle peasants (including three rich middle peasants), and six team leaders were new middle peasants. Among the fourteen team leaders, five were activists in the land reform movement, and eight were non-activists. One, called Liu Guoji, was known by the masses as a "fake activist," a rich middle peasant. Last spring, the problems between farmers had just been resolved, and as soon as mutual aid was called for, 90% of the masses organized. Each team selected people who were "good at speaking and reporting" to be team leaders, most of whom were middle peasants. This spring, the masses demanded the disbandment and reorganization of the teams, but the cadres were afraid to let go. The problems of mutual aid were resolved in part, and one and a half teams were disbanded. Individual team members jumped around to different teams, but the team leaders remained unchanged. These middle peasants were afraid of paying wages and unwilling to settle accounts. When Liang Madou suggested clearing accounts, Liu Guoji said, "Farmers all over the world are one family; what's the point of delaying work?" During the day, he said, "It delays production"; at night, he said, "Lighting lamps and burning oil, the nights are short." 2. Every team had cadre activists (poor peasants and farmhands) participating. However, because the fruit distribution was based on who had the problem, each person received an average of seven mu of land, while cadres received an average of ten mu. The cadres were afraid that settling accounts would require them to pay rice, which they couldn't afford, so they were also unwilling to settle accounts. 3. Some households, using their own labor and livestock to cultivate their own land, didn't suffer much loss or gain much advantage. They thought that organizing was better than farming in the old society, so they didn't bring up any issues. 4. Those who were supposed to earn wages had complaints. Erlin, with two laborers, felt he was losing out because only one laborer went to the mutual aid team. He kept complaining that he was at a disadvantage, and others called him "selfish." Because the wages hadn't been settled and paid immediately, it was even more difficult to discuss converting labor days into wages. Over time, everyone felt they were losing out. The leadership exposed the "fear of paying wages and unwillingness to settle accounts" and the "overly tolerant thinking," proposing that "tolerance, tolerance, the more you tolerate, the worse it gets!" It took a full five days to clear the accounts and make immediate cash payments. During the clearing of accounts, the issue of converting labor days into wages and leadership problems were raised.

    Guichou's donkey, Fawang's ox. During the account settlement, the donkey was more confusing than the ox, earning two dou of rice more. Guichou complained about losing out. Pangrou was a well-known good wheat harvester in the village. Because labor days weren't converted into wages, he always harvested with his wife. The team members of Wei Laoer's team complained that the team leader wasn't leading. One team was divided into two groups. Each team raised some issues, but most people were unwilling to speak up out of consideration for relationships.

    Bold Disbandment, Free Hands, Voluntary
    The leadership, considering the masses' demand for reorganization in the spring and the change in the composition of the team leaders, acted out of consideration for relationships at the time, thinking that people were unwilling to speak their minds. Liang Madou boldly proposed disbanding the teams, calling on everyone to "state their conditions, share their innermost thoughts, and reorganize voluntarily." Liu Guoji, afraid of not being a team leader, said, "My team won't disband." The team members stood up and said, "Don't be subjective; everyone wants to disband." Xia Ma clapped his hands and said, "Right!" After the mutual aid teams disbanded, people on the street were trying to guess what others were thinking, and everyone stated their conditions. Wei Bingquan said, "My condition is to settle accounts every day, not allowing any discrepancies." Jin Shun said, "If we want to do well in organizing our own mutual aid team, everyone should be in charge." Lao Rong said, "Some people feel pain as soon as they have to pay wages, getting upset. I won't work with them." Quanlin was quick-witted, running around the street but not joining a team, which worried him. He said, "I raise a big black donkey, but I can't find a team?" Erlin said, "Even if you raise an elephant, it won't work if you don't match hearts!" Quanlin went to examine himself. After Liu Guoji's team disbanded, he asked to join Suozi's team, but all the team members opposed it. He then went to find Pangrou's team, but Pangrou said, "You're good at speaking, only saying nice things. You have points when you look up and plans when you look down. This team is full of honest people; we don't buy your stuff." He looked for four teams in a row, but none of them wanted him. Guangxiu, who was also sharp-tongued, quick-witted, selfish, and self-interested, was also isolated.

    After a whole day of deliberation, by the second night, eight teams were completely voluntarily organized. Four teams had not disbanded but expanded their number of households, such as Erlin's team, which implemented the division of labor and the conversion of labor days into wages, expanding from eleven households to thirteen households. Four new teams were established. Six of the eight newly selected team leaders were poor peasants, and six were activists in the land reform movement.

    Self-Criticism, Changing Mindsets
    When everyone was sharing their innermost thoughts, on the one hand, they were trying to understand others' thoughts, and on the other hand, they were examining themselves. When stating conditions, on the one hand, they were letting others state their conditions, and on the other hand, they were stating their own conditions. Quanlin said he was a big black donkey. Others said even having an elephant wouldn't work. He couldn't join any team, so he examined himself (in the past, he resented anyone who criticized him). He said at the meeting, "I am selfish and don't obey the organization. I am quick-witted and lazy. If I join a team, I must change my bad habits." Everyone allowed him to join the team because they saw that he recognized his faults. Huaixi was lazy and couldn't join a team either. He also made a guarantee at the meeting: "I am a lazy person and afraid of getting up early. I need others to wake me up every day. From now on, I will get up early without needing others to wake me up. If I can't change, everyone can kick me out of the team." Erlin's team was generally recognized as a better team leader. Erlin also made a self-criticism, saying, "In the past, I was the only one in charge. From now on, everyone will be in charge. As the team leader, I hoed my own land twice before others, leaving others' seedlings to wither." Village Chief Wei Fusheng also examined himself, saying, "In the past, the conversion of labor days was unfair. My youngest daughter pulling millet was counted as one laborer, women were also counted as one laborer, and men were also counted as one laborer. From now on, I will make the conversion of labor days fair." Lao Rong only said, "I was active in the past, and I will be even more active in the future." The meeting was filled with self-criticism. Many people who had never spoken at meetings before made self-criticisms, continuing until dark.

    Expand Wheat Fields, Strive for a Full Harvest
    After the rectification of mutual aid, everyone's spirits were high. Madou said, "In the old society, the crops in the fields were patchy, with one section separated from another. This year, with mutual aid, everything is the same dark color and the same height. Only a few families didn't participate in mutual aid, and their crops are growing particularly poorly. If it weren't for mutual aid, could the crops grow so well? The Major Heat season showed a 70% yield, and mutual aid nurtured eight qing of seedlings. The second cultivation was completed by the second dog day, striving for a 90% yield. Now we see a 90% yield. After rectifying mutual aid, we will weed again, striving for a full harvest."

    The wheat field will be expanded from eight qing to thirteen qing, accounting for 40% of the village's land. Currently, 7,100 cartloads of manure and 600 containers of night soil have been created for the wheat fields. The manure will exceed last year's by 50%, striving for increased wheat production next summer. During the land reform movement, everyone said, "Follow Liang Madou to thoroughly overturn society." Now everyone is saying, "Follow Liang Madou to turn the poor gully into a rich gully." (Liu Cun)

　　梁马斗领导李村沟
  　换脑筋整顿互助组
    梁马斗领导李村沟群众整顿互助组，前后八天时间，取得一些经验：
    大算帐，现过现
    李村沟整顿互助一开始就是大算帐，清算四十天参战勤务，五个月优抗来自春天到现在互助组未清的工资问题。战勤优抗都发有工票，很快算清，互助组帐却难算清。大部分组从春天到现在是算帐不过现，有的几家过了现，几家拨拨兑兑没过清，有的组根本未算，弄成糊涂帐。
    为什么五个月的没有算清过了现呢？大家都说“天下农民是一家，皮皮薄薄不好看”，细研究起来，各阶层的心思不一样：一、十四个互助组，有八个组长是中农（其中有三个富中农），有六个小组长是新中农。十四个组长有五个翻身运动中的积极分子，八个非积极分子。一个叫刘过季，群众叫他“假积极分子”，是个富中农。去年春天，农民之间的问题刚解开圪塔，一号召互助，就有百分之九十的群众组织起来，各组选了“能说会道、能汇报”的人当组长，其中大部是中农。今年春天群众要求散组重新结合，干部不敢放手，解互助圪塔解决了一部份问题，散了一个半组，各组组员个别的跳了跳组，组长却原封不动。这些中农怕出工资不愿算帐，梁马斗提出意见要清帐，刘过季说：“天下农民是一家，误这工干什？”白天算，他说：“耽误生产”，黑夜算，他说：“点灯、熬油、夜短。”二、每个组都有干部积极分子（贫雇）参加，由于分果实时是谁的问题谁得，群众每人平均分七亩地，干部则平均十亩地，干部怕算帐出工资米，家里没底出不起，也不愿算帐。三、有些户自己的劳畜力种自己地也吃不了多大亏，也讨不了多大便宜，组织起来比旧社会种好了，也不提个什。四、该赚工资的有意见，二林两个劳力，嫌吃亏，只一个劳力去互助组受，他一直喊吃了亏，别人说他“自私自利。”因为工资还没算清过现，所以折工就更谈不到，时间长了，大家都觉得吃了亏。领导上揭破了“怕出工资不算帐”思想和“涵厚思想，”提出“涵厚，涵厚，越弄越臭！”用了整整五天时间，才把帐目算清现过现，在清算帐目中，提出折工问题和领导问题。
    贵丑的驴，发旺的牛，算帐时驴比牛糊涂，多赚了二斗米，贵丑提出吃亏；胖肉是村上挂了号的好割麦家，因为不折工他总和婆娘们相跟着割，魏老二组的组员提出组长不领导，一组分成两小组，各组都提出一些意见，但大部分问题却讲情面不愿提。
    大胆解散放手自愿
    领导上考虑到春天群众要求重新结合，和改变小组长的成份，当下讲情面，心想散嘴不愿说，梁马斗大胆提出散组，号召大家，“拿条件，碰心事，重新自愿结合。”刘过季怕当不成小组长说：“我这组不散”，组员们起来说：“你不要主观，大家都愿散”。瞎马则拍手说：“对！”互助组散了以后，整天街上的人都在各访心思话，各人拿各人的条件。魏丙全说：“我的条件是当天开帐，分毫不让。”金顺说：“咱组织自家的互助组，要想搞好，大家当家。”老荣则说：“有些人一出工资就心疼，气歪了，我就不和他一块互助。”全林是个活得脑，满街乱转就是不上个组，急得他说：“我喂个大黑驴还找不上个组？”二林说：“那怕你喂个象，碰不对心事不行！”全林就去检讨自己。刘过季组散了，他要求参加锁子组，全体组员都反对，他又去找胖肉组，胖肉说：“你能说会道，光说漂亮话，抬头是点，低头是计，这组都是老实人，不买你的货。”一连找了四个组，没有一个组要他，光秀也是又尖薄又嘴快自私自利的小组长，也被孤立出来。
    经过一整天的酝酿，到第二天半夜，完全经过自愿组织起来八个小组，有四个组未散扩大了户数，如二林组实行了划分活计，计工折工，由十一户扩大到十三户，新成立四个小组。八个新选的小组长，有六个贫农，有六个翻身运动的积极分子。
    自我批评换脑筋
    大家在碰心事时，一方面是摸别人心事，另方面是检讨自己，拿条件一方面是让别人拿条件，另方面是拿出自己的条件。全林说自己是个大黑驴。别人说有个象也不行，他到处入不了组就检讨自己（以前谁说他，他恼恨谁），他在大会上检讨说：“我自私自利不服从组织，我是个活得脑好懒，进来组一定要把毛病改了”，大家看他认识了自己的毛病才允许他参加组。怀喜是懒汉，也入不了组，他也在大会上提出了保证：“我是懒汉怕早起，天天用别人叫，以后我要早起不用别人叫，改不了大家踢我出组。”二林组是大家公认较好的组长，二林也进行了自我批评说：“以前我是一个当家，以后是大家当家，我当组长把自己的地先锄了两遍，别人苗荒了。”村长魏福盛也检讨起来：“以前折工不公道，我小女拔谷顶一个劳力，妇女也顶一个劳力，男人还顶一个劳力，以后一定把折工搞公道。”老荣只说：“过去我就积极，今后更要积极”。大会争着进行自我批评，许多从来不在大会发言的都进行了自我批评，一直到天黑。
    扩大麦田，争取十成收
    整顿互助以后大家情绪很高，马斗说：“旧社会地里庄稼有黑有黄，一隔一圪截；今年互助起来，一样黑，一样高。只有几只家没参加互助，长的分外歹；要不是互助双成家，庄稼能长那么好？大暑看有七分景，互助起来奶了八顷苗，二伏锄完二遍地，争取到九成景，现在看到九成，整顿了互助，再刮一遍草，争取十成收。”
    麦地准备由八顷扩大到十三顷，占全村土地的百分之四十，现造成麦地粪七千一百车，圊粪六百圪桶，粪要超过去年百分之五十，争取明年夏季增产麦子。翻身运动时大家都说：“跟上梁马斗翻身要翻透。”现在大家都说：“跟上梁马斗，穷沟变富沟”。（柳村）
