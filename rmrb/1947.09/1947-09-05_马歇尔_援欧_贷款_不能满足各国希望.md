Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 31st - Paris dispatch: The so-called "European Cooperation Committee" has been working for more than a month. Besides filling out a survey of the Western European countries' economies for a report to the United States, the recent discussion has centered on how much loan to ask from the United States. According to a New York Times correspondent in Paris on the 25th, the committee representatives felt uneasy when discussing this issue. According to these representatives, either trade relations with Eastern Europe must be restored, or the United States must lend Western European countries between $28 billion and $30 billion in the next four years, and then $4 billion annually after four years, in order to achieve "revival" in Europe. This kind of desire has been shattered by "private warnings" from the United States. According to a Daily Mail correspondent in New York, the United States believes that the sixteen member states of the "European Cooperation Committee" must reduce the above loan budget by one-third, preferably one-half. Otherwise, the U.S. Congress will definitely reject the U.S. "Aid to Europe" "Marshall Plan." The Washington Observer believes that Marshall may even refuse to submit his plan to Congress "unless Britain and its neighbors reduce their spending and tighten their belts even more."

　　马歇尔“援欧”贷款
  　不能满足各国希望
    【新华社陕北三十一日电】巴黎讯：所谓“欧洲合作委员会”工作已一月有余，除填制了一个向美国报告的西欧各国经济调查表外，最近讨论的中心是向美国要多少贷款。据纽约时报驻巴黎记者二十五日报导：委员会代表在讨论这一问题时，深感不安；据这些代表们说：或者必须与东欧恢复贸易关系，或者今后四年内美国必须贷予西欧各国二百八十亿美元至三百亿美元，四年以后每年又须贷予四十亿美元，才能使欧洲“复兴”。此种愿望，已为美国“私下警告”所粉碎。据英国每日邮报驻纽约记者报导，美国认为“欧洲合作委员会”的十六会员国，必须把上述贷款的预算减低三分之一，最好是二分之一。否则美国国会定将否决美国“援欧”的“马歇尔计划”。华盛顿观察家认为，马歇尔甚至可能拒绝将其计划提交国会，“除非英国及其邻国减低他们的支出，并更加束紧他们的裤带。”
