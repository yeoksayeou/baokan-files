　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 10th: Paris dispatch: The strike wave in France continues to expand. Following the 500,000-person mass demonstration in Paris, on the 8th, a strike and demonstration storm swept through southern, central, and northern France. In the southern city of Nîmes, the trade union announced a 24-hour strike that day and held a demonstration, submitting a protest declaration to the local government. In central Clermont-Ferrand, 20,000 automobile factory workers stopped work after 10,000 milk workers had already gone on strike. In the northwest, dockworkers in Le Havre also announced a strike on the same day and called on merchant ship employees to participate in a people's protest rally. The strike by railway workers in Lille in the north had developed into a general strike in the area on the 8th. Canal navigation in the north has ceased, and dockworkers and warehouse workers in Lille have all taken to the streets to participate in a large parade. In the northeast, 20,000 workers in Sainte-Marie-aux-Mines held a demonstration on the 8th to protest against the bread shortage. In addition, French cemetery caretakers have also joined the strike movement since the 5th. The General Secretary of the Paris District Trade Union and Communist, Henri Raynaud, denounced the current government on the 5th, saying: The efforts of the French working class to bring production to 90 percent of pre-war levels have been used by the Ramadier authorities to increase the profits of capitalists. The price of bread in September has increased by 128.5 percent compared to November last year. Ramadier agreed that Germans in the French-occupied zone of Germany could receive 500 grams (every 100 grams equals 2.68 taels) of bread per day, while French people are only allowed 200 grams. All these measures are taken under the orders of the United States and violate the interests of France.

　　法国罢工浪潮席卷南北各地
    【新华社陕北十日电】巴黎讯：法国罢工浪潮仍继续扩大中。继巴黎五十万人大示威后，八日罢工与示威风暴又席卷法国南部、中部及北部，南部尼姆城职工会那一天宣布罢工二十四小时，并举行示威，向当地政府提出抗议宣言。中部克勒蒙腓隆汽车工厂两万人继一万牛奶工人罢工之后，亦停止了工作。西北部哈佛尔港码头工人也于同日宣布罢工，并号召商船职员参加人民抗议大会。北部里尔铁路工人的罢工，在八日已发展成该地之总罢工。北部运河航行已停止，里尔的码头工人及仓库工人，一齐奔向街头，参加大游行。东北部圣地两万工人八日亦举行反对面包荒的示威游行。此外法国墓地看守人亦于五日起卷入罢工运动，巴黎区职工会总书记共产党人恩那弗五日斥责现政府称：法国工人阶级使生产达到战前水平百分之九十的努力，却被拉马第当局用来增加了资本家的利益。九月面包价格已较去年十一月增加了百分之一百二十八点五。拉马第同意在德境法占领区内的德国人一天可以得到五百格兰姆（每一百格兰姆合二两六钱八分）的面包，而对法国人却只允予两百格兰姆。这一切措施皆秉承美国的命令，而违背了法国的利益。
