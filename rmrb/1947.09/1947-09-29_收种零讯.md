　　Gleanings from Harvest and Planting Reports
    Sanwang Village Expands Wheat Fields
    Interplanting Seven *Qing* of Cornfields
    [This newspaper's dispatch] In Wu'an, Sanwang Village has a total of 21 *qing* and 40 *mu* of land. It plans to plant 16 *qing* and 50 *mu* with wheat. In order to complete this task, seven *qing* of cornfields need to be interplanted. According to past experience in interplanting wheat: First, it's earlier than plowing and planting wheat; one *mu* of land can yield five *dou* of grain, while plowing and planting the same land yields only two *dou*. As the saying goes, early interplanting of wheat leads to one seed sprouting into nine shoots and eighteen branches, also saving seeds. Second, there's no need for animal-drawn plows, solving the difficulty of livestock and making the autumn less busy. Third, interplanting one *mu* of wheat requires two *xiang* of labor, while plowing and planting wheat requires two workdays, also breaking the late-planting idea that "wheat isn't afraid of being late, only afraid of fertilizer being late." Currently, all eight major mutual aid teams in the village, with 120 male laborers and 150 female laborers, are hoeing the fields three times while interplanting wheat. According to reports from various teams on the 12th, they have already interplanted five *qing* of wheat, with two *qing* of cornfields remaining. They will complete everything by the 13th of this month. (Geng, Zengyu)
    Military University Fully Mobilized
    Assisting in Harvesting 1700 *Mu*
    [This newspaper's dispatch] The entire Military University, in the midst of extremely busy graduation preparations, squeezed out time to help local people with the autumn harvest. Since the Political Department of the university issued instructions at the end of August, with the active efforts of all comrades, from the 7th to the 10th, the four major *zhongdui* (graduation companies helped for one day, non-graduation companies for two days, and the office for three days) participated with a total of 2,775 workdays, harvesting 449.2 *mu* of millet, 563.6 *mu* of sorghum, 100 *mu* of corn, leveling 333 *mu* of stubble, transporting crops from 172.2 *mu*, hauling over 100 carts of manure, and harvesting beans and pulling sesame from 88.6 *mu*, totaling over 1,700 *mu*. During the assistance, the villagers sent water and cooked food, offered jujubes and boiled corn for the soldiers to eat, all of which the soldiers declined.

    @tou Village Calculates Possessions, Plants More Wheat to Compensate for Poor Harvest
    [This newspaper's dispatch from Xiyang] Cadres in @tou Village, in the First District, after calculating their possessions, recognized the severity of the disaster. They went to various groups to conduct household-by-household calculations and group-by-group planning, launching a challenge competition, creating a manure accumulation and wheat planting campaign. Within seven days, they accumulated coal ash fertilizer, smoked soil fertilizer, phosphorus soil fertilizer, and, including the manure and pen manure at home, a total of 24,086 *dan*. They have now determined to plant 410 *mu* of wheat, with an average of 58 *dan* of fertilizer applied per *mu*. Each person is guaranteed to plant two *da dou* of vegetables, with wild vegetables collected to supplement any shortfall, and wasteland is being reclaimed in preparation for sowing spring vegetables next year. They have also organized transportation to compensate for the poor harvest. (Xinying)
    Huguan Town Increases Production and Supports the Front
    After Finishing Regular Planting, Rush to Change Crops
    [This newspaper's dispatch from Huguan] The people of the town are actively responding to the county party committee's call to increase production, overcome the famine, and support the front line by planting wheat in a rush. Within seven days, all 350 *mu* of regular crops were planted with wheat, and 185 *mu* of changed crops have also been planted. Last year, only seven *mu* of 169 wheat were planted. This year, the original plan was to promote 225 *mu*, but now 281 *mu* have been planted. Military families apply an average of 73.5 *dan* of fertilizer per *mu*, while the masses apply an average of 58 *dan* (green manure is also calculated using a unified *ge@①* fertilizer conversion). Sorghum, bean, and other crop lands are to be changed to wheat planting. The main reasons for the rapid and successful completion of this movement are: First, accurate calculation and rational use of people, fertilizer, and livestock for plowing. Men and women working together, and leading cadres taking the lead in promoting the village's work quickly. Second, the universal rectification of mutual aid groups during the movement also played a major role in promoting wheat harvesting. (Huguan Town Working Group)
    Men, Women, and Children All Work Together
    Planting Wheat and Harvesting Grain Simultaneously
    [This newspaper's dispatch from Taiyue, 27th] Under the call for men and women to rush to plant and harvest together, various counties are actively harvesting grain and planting wheat.

Beiliu Village doesn't let anyone be idle or any livestock rest. In twenty days, they finished planting wheat, and starting from the 19th, they harvested 2,000 *mu* of grain in four days and threshed it in two days. They are now starting to plant wheat. Yuwu Village, after rectifying the mutual aid groups, rushed to plant wheat. The original wheat land was over 3,700 *mu*, and they plan to expand it by another 1,600 *mu*. The original wheat land in Jiazhuang was 993 *mu*, and they will expand it by another 105 *mu*. Starting from August 30th, they planted 130 *mu* in five days.

    三王村扩大麦田
    玉茭地串种七顷
    【本报讯】武安三王村全村土地二十一顷四十亩，计划种麦十六顷五十亩，为了完成这个任务，有七顷是玉茭地需串种。根据过去串麦的经验：一、比犁地种麦早，一亩地能打粮五斗，同样地犁地种麦只能打粮二斗。俗话说早串直麦，一籽九股十八叉，又省种籽。二、不用牲口人拉犁解决了牲口困难、到秋天也不十分忙。三、串一亩麦用工两晌，犁地种麦需两个工，也打破了“麦子不怕晚，光怕粪来晚”的晚种思想。现全村八个大互助组，男劳力一百二十，女劳力一百五十，一面锄三遍地、一面串麦子，据十二号各组汇报，已串麦子五顷，玉茭地还余二顷，本月十三日全部完成。（庚、增玉）
