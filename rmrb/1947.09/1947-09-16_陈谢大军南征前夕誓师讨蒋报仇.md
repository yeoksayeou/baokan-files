　　Xinhua News Agency, Jinji-Luyu, 14th—Before the southern expedition of Chen, Xie, Han, Kong, and Qin's army, a certain unit held a public memorial service for the families of martyrs who died during the difficult times, and a meeting to avenge Chiang Kai-shek. The venue was plastered with portraits of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang with bloodied mouths, with the large characters "Chiang Kai-shek, the Man-Eating Demon," written on them. The walls were covered with accusation letters written by all the commanders and fighters of the team to denounce Chiang Kai-shek. The soldiers held the spirit tablets of their deceased relatives, solemnly offered them at the memorial shed, and then held a public memorial service. First, Political Commissar Dong reported that 91 family members of soldiers in the unit had been killed by Chiang Kai-shek bandits, and more than 300 families had been forced into bankruptcy. After recounting the tragic deaths, Political Commissar Dong said with grief and indignation: "We have poured out all our grievances, found the root of our suffering, and realized that Chiang Kai-shek is our great enemy. Now, we must take revenge!" When liberated soldier Lü Guangqing spoke, he burst into tears. He said: "There is simply no way for poor people to survive in the Chiang-controlled areas. My father was killed by Chiang Kai-shek. I will not close my eyes in death if I do not avenge my father's death!" After Yang Daming recounted how his mother was forced to jump into a well by the landlord, he firmly stated: "My family has been liberated. I will resolutely follow the Communist Party to liberate the brothers who are still suffering under Chiang Kai-shek's oppression!" The slogan "Cross the Yellow River, eliminate Chiang Kai-shek, and liberate all of China" shook the entire venue. Finally, the entire venue swore: "(1) We will not go home until Chiang Kai-shek is overthrown! (2) We will not go home until the feudal despots are eliminated! (3) We will not go home until the people of the whole country are liberated! (4) We will not go home until we have made contributions to the people!"
　　Also: Before the departure of a unit of the Taihang Field Army, a conference of meritorious heroes was held on August 10th, and farewells were given to the people of the border area. More than 500 heroic veterans competed to submit plans to kill the enemy to the Party Committee, and solemnly and excitedly took oaths to the people. Qin Qizhong, a famous and outstanding commander of Taihang, and Han Shouhong, a banner bearer of the mass line, wrote in their joint plan: "This time we go out, we will more humbly study tactics, summarize experience, educate ourselves, improve our combat effectiveness, and win glory for the Taihang soldiers!" The meritorious service company that rushed to the top of Bo'ai City in fifteen minutes guaranteed to seize a heavy machine gun and capture 20 Chiang soldiers alive in the shortest possible time. The old fighters of Taihang said: "We have been looking forward to this day for so many years of revolution. We are not good men of Taihang if we fail to conquer the country and liberate the people of the whole country!" The liberated soldiers from Henan and Shaanxi were even more excited beyond words, rushing around with bayonets fixed on their rifles, gritting their teeth and saying: "Chiang Kai-shek, the traitor, and the village chiefs and bailiffs, the days of revenge are coming for you! See where you can escape?!"

    【新华社晋冀鲁豫十四日电】陈、谢、韩、孔、秦南征大军出征前，某部举行公祭艰难军属、讨蒋复仇大会。会场贴着张着血口的蒋介石匪徒画像，上写“吃人魔王蒋介石”大字，四壁贴满全队指战员写的讨蒋控诉书。战士们抱着被难亲人灵位，沉痛的供上灵棚，然后举行公祭。首由董政委报告该部被蒋贼杀害的军属计九十一人，被逼得倾家荡产的三百余人，在历述被害惨状后，董政委悲愤的说：“我们倒尽了苦水，找着了苦根，认清了蒋介石就是我们大仇人。现在，我们要报仇！”解放战士吕光清讲话时，痛哭失声。他说：“蒋管区就根本没有穷人的活路，我的父亲被蒋介石杀了，我不报杀父之仇，死也不合眼！”杨达明诉完他母亲被地主逼得跳井的情形后，坚决表示：“我家已解放了，我要坚决跟着共产党去解放还在受蒋介石压迫的弟兄！”“打过黄河去，消灭蒋介石，解放全中国”的口号，震撼全场。最后全场宣誓：“（一）不打倒蒋介石不回家！（二）不消灭封建恶霸不回家！（三）不解放全国人民不回家！（四）不为民立功不回家！”
    又：太行野战军一部出征前，于八月十日召开功臣大会，并告别边区人民。五百余英雄功臣竞以杀敌计划呈交党委，庄严兴奋地向人民举行宣誓。太行著名优秀指挥员秦启忠、群众路线旗手韩守红，在他们的联合计划中写着：“这次打出去，我们要更虚心研究战术，总结经验，教育自己，提高战斗力，为太行子弟兵争光！”十五分钟冲上博爱城头的功臣连，保证在最短期间缴重机枪一挺，活捉蒋军二十名。太行老战士们说：“革命这么多年，盼的就是这一天。打不下江山，解放不了全国的人民，就不算太行山的好汉！”河南、陕西籍的解放战士更是兴奋得难以言状，端着上了刺刀的步枪冲来冲去，咬着牙说：“蒋介石汉奸，乡长保长小子们，向你们报仇的日子可到了吧！看你往那里逃？！”
