　　Women and Children Challenge Fertilizer Accumulation
    [Report from our correspondents on the 1st] Chang Lanxiu, a female labor hero from Limachang Village in Jize, is leading the women and children of the entire village in accumulating fertilizer. When the farmers of the village discussed wheat planting, they discovered a severe shortage of fertilizer. The female hero Chang Lanxiu proposed creating manure primarily by women, children's groups, and sisters' groups, calling on each person to guarantee the production of one large cart. On the 27th of this month, the village women's association, children's groups, and sisters' groups held separate meetings to plan fertilizer production. The women's association, with a total of 110 people, planned to produce 120 carts of fertilizer. The sisters' group proposed to produce enough for 40 carts. The children's group planned to produce 60 carts. When the children's group and sisters' group challenged the women's association, they heard that the women's association was making 120 large carts, and they unanimously agreed to increase it by another 50 large carts. The women's association proposed that if they lost, they would make a new hat for each member of the children's group and a new schoolbag for each member of the sisters' group. If the children's group lost, each person would chop 50 jin of firewood for the women's association. The sisters' group said, "If we don't complete 60 large carts of fertilizer, each person will spin half a jin of thread for the women's association." After the meeting, the leader of the women's group in the front street immediately led the women to dig manure pits, and they dug one in the afternoon. The children's group was divided into groups for cutting grass, digging pits, and pushing soil, actively engaging in fertilizer production. Lan Zhaoniang from the east street, leaning on a crutch, pulled green grass. Under her influence, the 14 women in her group repaired seven manure pits in one day (including two old ones). Women in the west street used past grain storage caves and converted them into six large manure pits. In one day, the entire village created 38 manure pits, estimated to produce 95 carts of manure. The slogan "Strive to make a great contribution in fertilizer production" is filled in the entire village. (Zhu Bo)

　　妇女儿童挑战积肥
    【本报记者团一日电】鸡泽李马昌村女劳动英雄常兰秀，领导全村妇女儿童积肥。该村农民讨论种麦时，发现肥料非常缺乏，女英雄常兰秀提出以妇女、儿童团、姐妹团为主造圊肥，号召每人保证造一大车。本月廿七日，该村妇会儿童团姐妹团分别集会，计划造肥问题妇女会共一百一十人，计划造肥一百廿车。姐妹团提出，要造够四十车。儿童团计划造六十车。儿童团与姐妹团向妇会挑战时，听说妇会造一百二十大车，他们一致通过再增加五十大车。妇会提出如果输了，给儿童团每人做一顶新帽子、给姐妹团每人做一个新书包。儿童团如果输了，每人打五十斤烧柴给妇会。姐妹团说：“如果完不成六十大车肥料，每人给妇会纺半斤线子。”会议结束后，前街妇女组长马上领导着妇女掘粪坑，一下午就掘成了一个。儿童团分成割草、掘坑、推土等小组，积极进行造肥。东街兰召娘，拄着拐棍拔青草，她这组的十四个妇女，在她的影响下，一天修好七个粪坑（内有两个旧的）。西街妇女利用过去的藏粮洞，改成六个大粪坑。全村经一天时间，造圊肥三十八坑，估计可出九十五车圊肥，“争取在造肥中立一大功”的口号，充满全村。（朱波）
