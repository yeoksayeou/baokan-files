　　Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 17th: Late news: A certain unit of the East China People's Liberation Army annihilated more than 800 enemy troops with a small force on the He (Ze) Ju (Ye) highway at Huangzhenji (west of Shatuji) on the 1st of this month, creating a model of short-range interception and outflanking victory. On September 1, Chiang's bandit 68th Division 241st Regiment, entrenched in Wanglou (southwest of Shatuji) and Huangzhenji, colluded with the puppet security regiment to invade Guanzhuang, Pangzhuang and other places east of Huangzhenji. The PLA immediately intercepted them, and the bandits collapsed. A certain battalion of the PLA immediately pursued the fleeing bandits with one part of its force, and another part quickly outflanked the flanks and rear of the Chiang bandits, heading straight for the bandit nest in Wanglou. The enemy guarding a platoon abandoned their position after a brief engagement and fled. The PLA then crossed two ditches and a deer fence, seized the east gate of Huangzhen, and as soon as the firepower was deployed, the defeated bandits had scurried back to within 100 meters of the east gate. The PLA immediately launched a surprise and fierce strafe, forming a front and rear pincer attack with the PLA pursuing the fleeing bandits. In an instant, more than 300 Chiang bandits were left dead, and more than 500 were captured alive, recovering Huangzhenji, capturing a mountain gun, two mortars, six small guns, and eleven light and heavy machine guns.

　　Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 17th: Late news: On August 29, a certain unit of the East China People's Liberation Army routed the entire 68th Regiment of Chiang's bandit 88th Division, which had advanced from Cao County to invade Hanzhuang and Caizhuang, northwest of Cao County in southwestern Shandong. More than 500 enemies were killed and wounded, and more than 70 enemy troops, including a company commander, were captured. Six 60mm guns and hand cannons, and seven light machine guns were seized.

　　Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 17th: The East China People's Liberation Army Headquarters has just issued Public Communique No. 24, announcing the results of the complete annihilation of Chiang's bandit Reorganized 57th Division at Shatuji: A total of more than 8,000 officers and soldiers, including the division commander Duan Linmao (major general), the division political director Li Tiqing (major general), Wang Lizhi (deputy brigade commander of the 60th Brigade (formerly the 4th Provisional Brigade)), Luo Jueyuan (brigade commander of the 117th Brigade, major general), and Zhang Yubin (deputy brigade commander, senior colonel) were captured alive, and more than 2,000 were killed or wounded, totaling more than 10,000. Six Japanese-style howitzers (previously mistakenly reported as eight), two field guns, and a total of 100 mountain guns, mortars, etc., 181 grenade launchers, 590 light and heavy machine guns of various types, 3,649 long and short guns, 1,656 rounds of various shells, more than 400,000 rounds of various bullets, and a large number of military supplies were seized.

　　Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 17th: A unit of the East China People's Liberation Army, in coordination with the great counter-offensive, launched counter-attack battles in the Binbei area of Shandong. Starting from the 10th, the Chiang bandit 64th Division 156th Brigade, which had invaded Weixian and occupied Weicheng, was first compressed into a corner of the city and inflicted casualties with fierce artillery fire. At the same time, troops were divided into two groups to intercept the Chiang bandit 83rd Division and 28th Division, which had invaded Panshihe north of Rizhao, and the 64th Division 131st Brigade, which had invaded Daxiaodakou north of Zhucheng. After two days and nights of fierce fighting, more than 2,000 enemies were eliminated and more than 100 were captured, forcing another part of the bandit 64th Division, which had gathered in the Gaomi area to invade Jiaodong, to rush south for support. The Chiang bandit's plan to attack Jiaodong has been obstructed.
