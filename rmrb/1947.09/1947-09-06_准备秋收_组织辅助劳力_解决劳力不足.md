　　Preparing for the Autumn Harvest
  　Organizing Auxiliary Labor
  　Solving Labor Shortages
    [Our Newspaper] With the grain ears turning yellow, how to organize forces to prepare for the autumn harvest has become the central issue currently. The Taihang Second Special District Commissioner's Office summarized one of its experiences as: as long as auxiliary labor (women, children, and old men) are mobilized to the production front, the so-called labor shortage problem will cease to exist. The summary stated: When arranging production this spring, the lack of labor was said to be a major problem everywhere, and wasteland was likely a common phenomenon. At the time, we didn't dare boldly propose eliminating wasteland, only striving not to let land go to waste. The masses educated us and revised our plans. In Heshun, 63% of the labor force went to participate in the war, organizing 1,637 women, children, and old men, and within half a month, 400,000 mu of land were completely sown. In Zuoquan's Seventh District, 78% of the auxiliary labor force was organized, saving 14,838 workdays in half a month. Furthermore, the organization of auxiliary labor generated surplus labor, strengthening intensive cultivation and the integration of sideline occupations. Last year, Huyukou Village in Xiangyuan's Fourth District planted 4 mu of indigo and 5 mu of tobacco; this year, it planted 25 mu of indigo and 30 mu of tobacco, a six-fold increase compared to last year. Experience proves that semi-auxiliary labor is a potential and abundant force for productive labor and a source of replenishment for the labor army. The ironclad facts have shattered all old concepts—that the old cannot mount horses, the young cannot draw bows, and women are useless, etc. In fact, a skilled hand can't keep up with many people and horses. Everyone has work to do, and the old and young are not idle. The masses of Wen Yuan in Heshun said: "This year, fewer people planted earlier and more decisively." Yuan Shuangxi, an old man from Zuoquan, said: "Last year, I worked for eight-tenths of a share, but this year, I plow for ten-tenths of a share. I get older every year, but I earn more shares every year."

    【本报讯】谷穗发黄，如何组织力量准备秋收，成为当前中心问题。太行二专署总结经验之一为只要将辅助劳力（妇女儿童老汉）动员到生产战线上去，所谓劳力缺乏问题就不存在了。该总结称：今春布置生产时，各地叫劳力缺乏是大问题，荒地可能是普遍现象。当时不敢大胆提出消灭荒地，只提争取不荒地。群众教育了我们，修正了我们的计划。和顺百分之六十三的劳力去参战，组织妇女儿童老汉一六三七一人，半月内四十万亩地完全下种。左权七区组织辅助劳力百分之七十八，半月内省工一四八三八个。又因组织辅助劳力产生了剩余劳力，加强精耕细作及副业结合。襄垣四区虎峪口村去年种蓝四亩，烟五亩；今年多种蓝二十五亩，烟三十亩，比去年增加六倍。经验证明半辅劳力是生产劳动的潜在雄厚力量，是劳动大军的补给源泉，铁的事实粉碎了一切旧观念——老的不能上马，少的不能拉弓，妇女不顶事等。其实好手赶不上人马多，人人有活做，老少没闲人。和顺温源群众说：“今年人少种的早又干脆。”左权原双喜老汉说：“去年劳动顶八分，今年掌犁顶十分，岁数一年比一年老，顶分一年比一年多。”
