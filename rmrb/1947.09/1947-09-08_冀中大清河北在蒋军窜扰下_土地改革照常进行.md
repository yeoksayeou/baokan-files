　　Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 2nd: Despite the harassment of Chiang Kai-shek's troops, land reform in the Daqing River area of ​​Hebei Province, Central Hebei, is proceeding as usual under the victorious development of guerrilla warfare. In more than 120 villages including Gu'an City and Xigong Village, the mobilization of the masses has begun under the cover of the county brigade. Farmers in eight villages, including Sixingzhuang and Nangong Village, have initially gained liberation. Chiang Kai-shek's continuous "mopping-up" operations have been crushed. When the 4th Division of Chiang Kai-shek's 13th Army crossed the Daqing River last month, it was stubbornly resisted by the brigade, resulting in over 20 deaths. Masses in villages such as Sixingzhuang, Xiluzhuang, and Caizhuang calmly distributed the fruits of the liquidation amidst the artillery fire. When transferring, they also took the targets of struggle away to continue the liquidation. Villages in Ba County and Rongcheng County, coordinated with landmines, tunnels, and militia field operations, persisted in defending villages, persisted in working, and took in fleeing Chiang Kai-shek puppet soldiers. The postal lines in the area are still open. Postal workers, despite the tense war situation and the constant possibility of encountering the enemy, continue to deliver mail. Recently, the Central Hebei Military Region issued a special order commending the heroic soldiers and civilians in the Daqing River area. The order stated that since August 4th, the local armed forces have killed and captured more than 420 Chiang Kai-shek soldiers, especially the Daxing and Xiong County Brigades and the militia in areas such as Xincheng, Xiong County, and Ba County, whose achievements are excellent. The order calls on the soldiers and civilians in various regions to make persistent efforts and thoroughly defeat Chiang Kai-shek's "mopping-up" operations. Additionally, the "Central Hebei Report" published an editorial titled "Salute to the Soldiers and Civilians of the Daqing River Area," stating, "It is not easy for the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries to piece together troops, and their dream of securing the Pingjin-Bao triangle area will definitely not be realized."
    Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 30th: Border region ordnance workers are supporting the front line with their energetic labor production competition. One factory has completed several times the artillery shell production of the same period in the past in the last ten days. The production of worker Dong Guokui in a certain factory has exceeded 300% of the original plan. Now, working overtime has become a common practice in various factories. Li Wanming, a worker in a certain factory, works from morning to late at night before returning to the dormitory, working overtime for as long as 99 hours in a month. Female workers Liu Sumei and Li Zhihui in another factory are unwilling to rest even on holidays and Sundays, and work as usual.
