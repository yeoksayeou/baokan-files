　　Zhang Xuesi's "September 18th" Speech
  　The People of Northeast China Have Sufficient Strength
  　To Eliminate Chiang Kai-shek's Bandit "Second Manchuria" Rule
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northeast China, 18th] On the eve of the sixteenth anniversary of the "September 18th" Incident, our reporter paid a special visit to Zhang Xuesi, the anti-Japanese general and current Vice Chairman of the Northeast Administrative Committee, who made a speech stating: The day when the people of Northeast China will settle accounts with the traitor Chiang Kai-shek's bandits and take total revenge is not far off. The large-scale counter-offensive by the People's Liberation Army inside the passes powerfully encourages the 40 million compatriots in Northeast China to redouble their confidence and accelerate the complete elimination of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang's brutal "Second Manchuria," and to repay the blood debt of the past fourteen years. Vice Chairman Zhang continued: The democratic regime in the Northeast Liberated Areas has undergone the test and training of land reform and self-defense wars over the past two years. In the past year, it has mobilized and organized nearly 500,000 people to serve the war, fully supporting the farmers' just land struggle. Therefore, it can take root among the people and form a strong contrast to the heinous rule of the "Second Manchuria," becoming the place where the people in the Chiang-controlled areas pin all their hopes. The ten million people who have regained their freedom during the summer offensive are now engaged in a fierce struggle to liquidate and take revenge by distributing land. The rear areas are responding to the great victories of the Democratic Allied Forces by thoroughly eliminating feudalism, striving for production, and fully supporting the front lines. Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang, in collusion with American imperialism, is supporting Japanese warlords and financial groups, attempting to extend their bloody claws into Northeast China once again and create a second "September 18th." However, the strength of the people of Northeast China and the entire Chinese people is now very different from what it was sixteen years ago. The people of Northeast China have the confidence and the strength to completely and thoroughly eliminate Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang in Northeast China outside the Shanhaiguan Pass, and further actively prepare to support the liberation struggle inside the passes from all aspects. It can be predicted that the people of Northeast China will inflict continuous and severe blows on the bandits, while we will become stronger and more powerful day by day. Finally, Vice Chairman Zhang said: I am a son of the people of Northeast China. On the sixteenth anniversary of the "September 18th" Incident, I cannot help but think of my brother, General Zhang Xueliang, the leader of the Northeast Army who advocated resistance against Japan; he has been imprisoned by Chiang Kai-shek's bandits for ten years, and there are countless parents, brothers, and sisters in Northeast China who are being killed, devastated, and humiliated by Chiang's bandits and have not yet been liberated. I and all the people of Northeast China resolutely demand the complete elimination of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang's "Second Manchuria" rule, to avenge our parents, brothers, and sisters, and liberate all the people of Northeast China. Only in this way can General Zhang Xueliang, who advocated resistance against Japan, and the countless imprisoned patriotic and democratic individuals, gain freedom.

　　张学思氏“九一八”发表谈话
  　东北人民具有充分力量
  　消灭蒋匪“二满洲”统治
    【新华社东北十八日电】“九一八”十六周年的前夕，本社记者特走访抗日将领、现东北行政委员会张学思副主席，承其发表谈话称：东北人民清算卖国贼蒋介石匪徒和总复仇的日子已为期不远了，关内人民解放军的大举反攻，有力的鼓舞着东北四千万同胞以百倍的信心，加速彻底消灭蒋家匪帮暴虐的“二满洲”，讨还十四年的血债。张副主席继称：东北解放区的民主政权已经历了两年来土地改革与自卫战争的考验和锻炼，过去一年中动员与组织了将近五十万的人民为战争而服务，以全力支持了农民正义的土地斗争，因此能在人民中日益生根而与“二满洲”的万恶统治形成了强烈的对比，并成为蒋区人民一切希望寄托的所在。夏季攻势中重睹天日的一千万人民，现正进行着猛烈的清算复仇分地斗争，后方地区则以彻底消灭封建，努力生产，全力支援前线来回答民主联军伟大的胜利。蒋家匪帮勾结美帝国主义扶植日本军阀财阀，企图把血腥的魔爪再一次的伸入东北，制造第二个“九一八”，但是东北人民和全中国人民的力量已经和十六年前大不相同了，东北人民有信心而且有力量把东北蒋家匪帮全部彻底的消灭在山海关外，并进而从各方面积极准备支援关内的解放斗争。可以预言：东北人民将予匪徒以连续不断的严重打击，而我们则一天比一天的坚强和壮大。最后张副主席谈称：我是东北人民的子弟，在“九一八”十六周年的今天，我不能不想起我的哥哥——力主抗日的东北军领袖张学良将军；他被蒋介石匪徒监禁已经十年，而全东北更有千千万万正在遭受蒋匪杀害摧残凌辱的父母兄弟和姊妹现在还未解放，我和全东北人民一致坚决要求彻底消灭蒋介石匪帮的“二满洲”统治，为我们的父母兄弟姊妹复仇，解放全东北人民，只有这样，主张抗日的张学良将军和千千万万被监禁的爱国民主人士，才能获得自由。
