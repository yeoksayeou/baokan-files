Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, 6th: Li Jingquan, Secretary of the CCP Jin-Sui Sub-bureau and Political Commissar of the Jin-Sui Military Region, called on the entire Party and Army in Jin-Sui to launch an anti-"Keli Kong" movement at the "September 1st" Journalist Day evening party, to correct their work style and temper their class stance. He emphasized: Keli Kong exists not only in the journalistic field, but also in every work department; at the same time, Keli Kong is inseparable from Gorlov (the arrogant general in the play "Front"). Keli Kong writes for Gorlov, and Gorlov exists everywhere in the Party, the government, and the army, but in different forms. It is good that the newspaper openly exposed the shortcomings and errors in journalism. We can study whether the regimes in many of our regions are new regimes or old regimes? Is our Party very pure? How much have we done to serve the peasants? In the past few years, we engaged in production campaigns, 80% large-scale mutual aid, the May 1st Great Reclamation, and model projects. How much achievement did we actually make? What kind of life are the poor peasants living? Everyone can think about it. Many landlords and despots still rule the peasants everywhere. Yangjiaqu in JingLe County, was once called a "model village." Four evil landlord brothers all infiltrated the Party. Some became district cadres, and some became village cadres. They directly and indirectly killed more than forty people. Isn't this as serious as Gorlov losing a battle? But in the past, we couldn't see these things. An arrogant Gorlov plus a lying Keli Kong caused us to suffer a great defeat. Therefore, I propose to extend the anti-Keli Kong campaign to all departments and corners of the Party, government, army, and people, and call on everyone to conduct self-criticism. Those who falsely report situations to claim credit and be complacent should openly admit their mistakes. Secondly, Political Commissar Li pointed out that in our work, there are not only problems like Keli Kong and Gorlov, but also problems like Kang Shuxin and Ai Bo (Kang was a landlord element who sabotaged land reform and was purged by the Jin-Sui Daily, and Ai was a reporter who shielded landlords and suppressed peasants). The former is a problem within the revolutionary ranks, and the latter are class alien elements who have infiltrated the revolution, which is the main aspect we are attacking today. Today, there are still facts of landlords usurping the Party and seizing power in some places. Only by overthrowing these people can the peasants be liberated. Only by reversing bad ideological positions can we correct our mistakes. Only by honestly serving the people can we implement the land reform policy, and only then will the peasants support our Party and persevere in the struggle to the end. We welcome those who abandon the reactionary class stance. If anyone insists on the landlord stance, we will resolutely expel them from the Party.

　　晋绥党委号召党政军各部门
  　严格实行自我批评
    推广反“客里空”运动改正工作作风
    【新华社晋绥六日电】中共晋绥分局书记兼晋绥军区政治委员李井泉，于“九一”记者节晚会上号召晋绥全党全军展开反“客里空”运动，改正工作作风，锻炼阶级立场。他着重指出：客里空不仅新闻界有，而且各个工作部门都有；同时客里空和戈尔洛夫（“前线”一剧中老大自满的将军）是分不开的，客里空是替戈尔洛夫执笔的，戈尔洛夫在党内、政府内、军队内也到处都有，不过表现形式不同。这次报纸公开揭发新闻工作中的缺点和错误是好的，我们可以研究一下我们不少地区的政权是新政权还是旧政权？我们的党是不是很纯洁？替农民服务了多少？我们前几年搞生产运动，搞百分之八十的大变工，搞五一大开荒，搞模范，到底有多少成绩？贫苦农民过的什么生活？大家可以想一想，许多地主恶霸还到处统治着农民，静乐央家曲过去也称为“模范村”，一家恶霸四兄弟都混进了党内，有的当了区干部，有的当了村干部，他们就直接间接害死了四十几个人，这和戈尔洛夫打败仗还不是一样地严重吗？但是我们过去对这些看不见，自满的戈尔洛夫加上一个说谎话的客里空，使我们打了大大的败仗。所以我提议把反客里空推广到党政军民各个部门各个角落去，号召大家进行自我批评，凡邀功自满假报情况的应公开承认错误。其次李政委又指出，在我们的工作中不仅有客里空与戈尔洛夫一类的问题，而且还有康舒新、艾柏一类的问题（按康是被晋绥日报清洗的破坏土改的地主分子，艾是包庇地主打击农民的记者），前者是革命队伍内部的问题，后者是混入革命里的阶级异己分子，是我们今天主要打击的方面；今天有些地方还存在着地主篡党篡政的事实。只有打倒这些人，农民才能解放；反掉坏思想立场，我们才能改正错误。老老实实地为人民服务，才能贯彻土地改革政策，农民才会拥护我党，坚持斗争到底。对于放弃反动阶级立场的人，我们表示欢迎；如果有人坚持地主立场，我们就坚决开除他的党籍。
