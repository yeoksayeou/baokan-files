[Taiyue, 8th of this month] Gaoping Duoze Village has proposed to "accumulate manure equivalent to 1.5 mu of land for every mu of wheat field." Therefore, starting from the 18th of last month, the village organized all male and female full and semi-laborers. Within five days, they cut over 25,000 jin of thorns, which can be applied to 47.5 mu of wheat land. Next year, the yield per mu can be increased by 2 dou. Niu Yinghai said: "To have good crops, you need deep plowing and sufficient manure. As long as we plow more and apply more manure, we can harvest more grain." Now, everyone has proposed to guarantee planting 2.5 mu of wheat per person and is actively rushing to plow the wheat fields. All 82 mu of wheat fields in the village have been plowed twice and are now being plowed for the third time.

    【本报太岳八日电】高平朵则村，提出“每亩麦地要积亩半地的粪”。所以自上月十八日起，将全村男女全半劳力组织起来，五天内割荆二万五千余斤，可上麦地四十七亩五分，明年每亩可增产二斗，牛迎孩说：“庄稼要好，犁深粪饱，只要我们多犁多上粪，就能多打粮”。现在大家又提出保证每人种麦二亩五分，正积极赶犁麦地，全村八十二亩麦地已全部犁过两遍，正赶犁三遍。
