    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, September 25th: Pyongyang dispatch: General Shtykov, head of the Soviet delegation to the Soviet-American Joint Commission on Korea, recently issued a statement to the press, exposing the US plot to undermine the Soviet-American Joint Commission. He stated: "Before the two delegations discussed the draft joint report proposed by both delegations, the US delegation suggested that the commission need not compile a joint report (note: the suggestion to draft a joint report was originally proposed by Marshall and later agreed to by Molotov). The US delegation did not seriously discuss the drafts proposed for compiling an acceptable joint report, but nitpicked and emphasized the differences between the drafts, striving to hinder all possibilities of compiling a joint report, thereby using this as an example to prove that the commission could not reach an agreement." The statement condemned the various plans recently proposed by the US delegation as "actually perpetuating the current state of division in Korea, which is a serious danger to the Korean people." The statement concluded: "The Soviet Union insists that the two delegations must accurately and fully implement the Moscow resolution on Korea and the Molotov-Marshall agreement. Only in this way can the Joint Commission effectively complete the task of establishing a unified provisional Korean democratic government, which the Korean people eagerly desire."

    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, September 25th: To cater to the interests of its American masters, the Chiang Kai-shek government is now actively preparing to open trade with southern Korea, which is under US control. According to a dispatch from the Central News Agency in Nanjing on September 24th, citing the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission: the commission received an order from the Chiang family's Executive Yuan as early as June, stipulating that Sino-Korean trade be partially opened. "Merchants" residing in Korea were allowed to apply for import of goods, except those prohibited from import, and all could be reported for tax payment and release after the issuance of the order. As for the detailed measures for the official opening of Sino-Korean trade, the Chiang family's Ministry of Foreign Affairs must first seek the opinions of the United States before finalizing them. As southern Korea is currently a major base for smuggling a large number of Japanese goods into China for dumping, the actual effect of the so-called opening of Sino-Korean trade is nothing more than facilitating the large-scale dumping of Japanese goods into China, enabling them to thoroughly crush China's national industry.

    美国欲使朝鲜永久陷于分裂
    苏方发表声明斥责
    【新华社陕北二十五日电】平壤讯：朝鲜苏美联合委员会苏代表团团长西地科夫将军近向报界发表声明，揭发美国破坏苏美联合委员会的阴谋称：“双方在讨论两代表团所提的共同报告草案前，美代表团即建议委员会不必编纂共同报告（按草拟共同报告之建议，原由马歇尔提出，后经莫洛托夫同意者），美代表团不郑重讨论为编纂可能接受的共同报告而提出的草案，而吹毛求疵强调草案间的分歧，力求阻碍编纂共同报告的一切可能性，从而以此为例证明委员会不可能获致协议。”该声明斥责美代表团最近所提的各种计划，“实际上是使目前朝鲜分裂之情形永久延续下去，这对朝鲜人民实有严重危险。”声明最后称：“苏联坚持两代表团必须确切而完全实施莫斯科关于朝鲜之决议，和莫洛托夫马歇尔协议的愿望，只有如此，联合委员会才能有效地完成朝鲜人民渴期之至的统一临时朝鲜民主政府之任务。”
    【新华社陕北二十五日电】蒋介石政府为适应其美国主子利益，现又积极准备开放对美国控制下南部朝鲜之贸易。据中央社南京二十四日电引侨委会消息：该会早于六月间即接蒋家行政院电令，规定部分开放中韩贸易，允准旅韩“商人”于该电令发出后，所申请之进口物品除属于禁止进口者外，一律可报差纳税放行。至于正式开放中韩贸易之详细办法，则须由蒋家外交部先征求美国意见之后，再行订出，按朝鲜南部现为大量日货走私至中国倾销之大本营，故所谓开放中韩贸易，其实际作用，亦不过是更方便于日货大规模对华倾销，使其得以彻底粉碎中国的民族工业。
