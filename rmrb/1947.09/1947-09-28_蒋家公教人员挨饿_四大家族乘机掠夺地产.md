Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th. Chiang Kai-shek's inflation policy has resulted in continuously rising prices, forcing millions of lower- and middle-ranking public employees in Chiang-controlled areas into starvation. According to a Central News Agency dispatch from Nanjing, when Chiang's bandit Legislative Yuan met on the 15th, some "Legislative Yuan members" put forward a temporary motion demanding that the Chiang government provide "living loans for public employees." The proposal revealed that "most of the public employees who are members of the (Chiang) government are struggling in famine every day." Therefore, they demanded that Chiang's four major banks grant loans to maintain their livelihoods on the condition that public employees use "real estate as collateral." In other words, public employees who have exhausted their efforts for Chiang Kai-shek and still cannot get enough to eat, must ultimately offer their "real estate" to the banks of the four major families as "collateral" to beg for living loans. However, even this proposal has not yet yielded results and is still "under review" in the Chiang bandit government's bureaucratic departments.
Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 21st. Under the monopolistic rule of the China Salt Company, a bureaucratic capitalist enterprise of the Chiang Kai-shek gang, salt fields in North and Northeast China have generally reduced production. According to the Tianjin Ta Kung Pao and Central News Agency, the company owns more than 290,000 mu of salt fields in North China, but so far, the output is only more than 2.2 million dan, less than one-third of the estimated output of 7 million dan this year. In Northeast China, there are more than 500,000 mu of salt fields, but this year only 2.7 million dan can be produced, only one-eighth of the annual production capacity of 20 million dan.

    蒋家公教人员挨饿
    四大家族乘机掠夺地产
    【新华社陕北十八日电】蒋介石的通货膨胀政策造成物价不断上涨的结果，迫使数以百万计的蒋管区中下级公教人员陷于饥饿。据中央社南京电，蒋匪立法院十五日开会时，即有若干“立法委员”提出临时动议，要求蒋政府举办“公教人员生活贷款”，该提案透露：“为（蒋）政府组成分子的公教人员，今日大多数均日在饥荒之中挣扎”，因此要求蒋匪四大银行在公教人员以“房地产为抵押品”的条件下，准予贷款维持生活。就是说：为蒋介石出尽气力仍不得一饱的公教人员，到头来尚要拿出“房地产”给四大家族的银行做“抵押品”以乞求生活贷款。然而就是此项提案亦尚无结果，仅在蒋匪政府官僚衙门“审查中”。
    【新华社陕北廿一日电】在蒋家匪帮官僚资本的中盐公司垄断统治下，华北东北盐田普遍减产。据津大公报及中央社消息透露：该公司在华北占有盐田达二十九万余亩，迄今产量仅二百余万担，不足预计今年产量七百万担之三分之一。东北方面有盐田五十余万亩，本年仅能生产二百七十万担，仅为每年生产力二千万担的八分之一。
