Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 21st. A CCP spokesperson today sternly condemned the Canadian government for announcing the aid of 150 aircraft to Chiang Kai-shek at the instigation of American imperialism. According to an Ottawa dispatch from the Associated Press on the 16th, a Canadian government spokesperson stated on the 15th: "The Canadian Department of External Affairs has agreed to have the Canadian War Assets Corporation sell 150 twin-engine Mosquito aircraft to the Chinese government (referring to the Chiang government)." The Canadian government spokesperson attempted to conceal the Canadian government's actions in assisting Chiang's bandit gang in the civil war, claiming that this sinful transaction was a "commercial act" negotiated in 1945; that Canadian policy "does not prohibit the sale of military arms to belligerent countries"; and that "these 150 aircraft will not be enough to determine a military issue," etc. The CCP spokesperson pointed out: The Canadian government's sophistry is shameful, and this action by the government is clearly an open act of hostility towards the Chinese people; at the same time, it also demonstrates that the government has become a despicable appendage and accomplice of American imperialism. This reactionary behavior by the Canadian government will inevitably damage Sino-Canadian friendship and inevitably arouse strong opposition from the Chinese people and the Canadian people. However, this despicable behavior by the Canadian reactionaries cannot save the fate of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang; it can only lead to one result: that the Canadian reactionaries are nakedly exposed before the Canadian people and the people of the world as enemies of world peace and justice, and as lackeys of American imperialism.

    加拿大充当美国走狗援蒋内战
    中共发言人严厉指斥
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】中共发言人今严厉指斥加拿大政府在美帝国主义授意下，宣布以一百五十架飞机援助蒋介石一事。据美联社渥太华十六日电，加拿大政府发言人十五日称：“加拿大外交部已同意由加拿大战争资财公司卖给中国政府（指蒋政府）一百五十架双引擎的蚊式机。”加拿大政府发言人企图掩饰加政府帮助蒋匪内战的行为，说什么这个罪恶买卖是一九四五年即行商议的“商业行为”；说什么加拿大的政策“是不禁止以军火武器出卖给作战国家”；以及“这一百五十架飞机将不足以决定一个军事问题”等等。中共发言人指出：加拿大政府的诡辩是可耻的，该政府这一行动显然是公开与中国人民为敌；同时，也表示出该政府已成为美国帝国主义的卑鄙的附庸与帮凶。加拿大政府的这种反动行为，必然破坏中加友谊，必然引起中国人民和加拿大人民的强烈反对。但是加拿大反动派这种卑鄙的行为，决不能挽救蒋介石匪帮的命运，它只能引起一个结果，就是：加拿大反动派在加拿大人民与世界人民的面前，赤裸裸的暴露自己是世界和平与正义的敌人，是美国帝国主义的走狗。
