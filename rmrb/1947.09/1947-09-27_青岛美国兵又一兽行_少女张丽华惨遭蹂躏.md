Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 25th: The day after the U.S. imperialist military tribunal in Nanjing declared the murderer, U.S. soldier Sefenni, not guilty, another bestial act occurred in Qingdao, where three U.S. soldiers gang-raped a Chinese woman, leaving her on the verge of death. According to an Associated Press dispatch from Beijing on the 24th, citing a local Qingdao newspaper report, Ms. Zhang Lihua (transliteration), only seventeen years old, was forcibly gang-raped by three U.S. Marines on the street late at night on the 20th. When the police found her, the victim was in a semi-conscious state, her mouth stuffed with cloth to prevent her from screaming. After the incident, the U.S. Marine Corps military police forced the victim to accept 20 U.S. dollars, attempting to settle this tragedy with this insulting act towards a Chinese compatriot. Newspapers in Beijing have published this horrific and inhumane act by U.S. soldiers as a front-page headline.
