　　[This article was] transmitted by this newspaper. Vice Chairman Rong of the Border Region Government visited the Yellow River project on the 31st of last month and extended cordial greetings to the dike workers and flood victims, expressing satisfaction with the projects along the Yellow River. Vice Chairman Rong encouraged the cadres and the masses serving on the Yellow River to make persistent efforts to strengthen flood prevention work and crush the Jiang bandit's plot to flood the liberated areas.
    Xinhua News Agency, Jinji Luyu, 11th: Since the great Yellow River flood, Communist Party members and cadres in Fan County along the river have taken the lead in joining shock brigades and leading the masses in rescue efforts. The branches in the fifth district held党员 meetings, and all Party members pledged to the Party to achieve the following four points: (1) Ensure that all Party members participate in the flood-fighting shock brigade. (2) Ensure timely supply of materials needed on the dike. (3) Ensure that male party members go to the dike to prevent floods, and female party members lead the masses to undertake all logistical support tasks. (4) Party members, under any circumstances, sacrifice everything of their own to complete the task. When the northeast of Jiang Village in the second district was flooded on August 28, the willow branches and stalks were washed away by the water. Five people, including Shi Yubin, the deputy commander of the district, Ge Huaiwen, the head of the engineering section, and Chu Maoxiang, the head of the rescue team, volunteered to go into the water and persisted in working in the water up to their necks for two hours, finally turning the dangerous situation into a safe one. When 47 villages near the river were flooded in the third district, Deputy District Chief Li personally led the crew to rescue the victims, salvaging supplies on the one hand and resettling the old, weak, women and children to safe areas north of the dike on the other. When the sand dike from Kou Village in the south to Wangmianzhuang in the north in the fifth district was in danger, cadre Zhang Dianxing and other members of the assault team led more than ten assault team members to repair a 150-meter-long stalk broom, making the dike safe. Since going to the dike, Zhang Dianxing has personally gone into the water to explore the bottom, led the way in driving piles, distributing soil and moving materials, sometimes without sleeping all night. He is recognized by the whole district as a first-class model flood prevention cadre.
