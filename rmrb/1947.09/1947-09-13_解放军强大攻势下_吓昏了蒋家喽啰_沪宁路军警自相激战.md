　　Liberation Army's Powerful Offensive Terrifies Chiang's Gangsters
  　Military Police on Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Fight Each Other
    【Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 10th】 Due to being terrified by the powerful offensive of the People's Liberation Army, a comedy of mutual fighting between railway police and civil defense forces recently occurred on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway in the Chiang-controlled area. According to an Associated Press dispatch from Shanghai on the 8th, newly established railway police and civil defense soldiers on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway at a certain station in western Shanghai opened fire on each other for two hours on the night of the 7th. Both sides believed the other to be Communist troops or armed rebels, so the firepower of both sides became increasingly fierce, and each side hurriedly requested reinforcements from their superiors. The special express train to Nanjing was also stopped for one to one and a half hours. As for the details of how this comedy "began, how it ended, and the number of casualties, etc., are not yet known."

　　解放军强大攻势下
  　吓昏了蒋家喽啰
  　沪宁路军警自相激战
    【新华社陕北十日电】由于被人民解放军强大攻势所吓昏，蒋区沪宁路近发生一路警与民防队自相激战的喜剧。按美联社上海八日电报导，沪宁路新成立的路警与民防队士兵，在沪西沪宁路某车站，于七日夜互相开火达两小时之久，双方皆以为对方为共军或民变武装，所以双方炮火均愈来愈凶，并各自急忙向其上峰请求援军。开往南京的特别快车也被停顿了一小时至一小时半之久。至于此一场喜剧“如何开始，如何结束及伤亡人数等详情尚未获悉。”
