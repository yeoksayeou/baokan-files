    【Benbao Jinan Twenty-third Dispatch】Those who don't have enough to eat will be given to, and the peasants harvest the crops of landlords and estates. In the fourth district of Ningnan, 581 households of landlords and rich peasants have been seized one after another. The autumn harvest is in full swing. After discussions by village groups, it was decided that all the autumn crops of the landlords should be harvested by the farmers' association and distributed to the peasants. Whoever harvests it will own it entirely. Based on the quality of the autumn harvest, each household will receive a maximum of three mu. When the farmers' association distributes the fruits of the harvest, those who received too much will return the surplus, and those who received too little will be compensated, to meet the needs of the poor peasants. The distribution must be discussed in detail by the groups, and no one can take charge of it single-handedly. In the second district of Qinghe, after the poor people's training returned to the villages on September 8th, each village discussed how to deal with the crops in the fields after the landlords were seized. Everyone believed that the crops of the landlords should be harvested by the poor, and those who did not have enough to eat should be given to. The village cadres then led the poor people to harvest, and everyone was extremely excited.

    宁南分秋
    【本报冀南二十三日电】谁没吃的就分给谁，农民收没地主秋庄稼。宁南四区先后扣起地主富农五百八十一户，秋收正紧，各村群众经小组讨论，决定地主的秋苗一概归农会收割，分给农民。谁收都即全部归谁，根据秋苗收成好坏，每户最多不超过三亩，待农会分果实时，长退短补，满足贫农要求。分配须经过小组详细讨论，任何人不能包办。清河二区九月八日贫民集训回村，各村即讨论扣押起地主，地里的庄稼如何处理？都认为地主的庄稼应由穷人收割，谁没吃的就分给谁，村干即率领各贫民去割，大家兴奋异常。
