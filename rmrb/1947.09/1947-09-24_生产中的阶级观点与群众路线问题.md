    The Qiu County Party Committee convened a district secretary meeting on the 17th to review the leading ideology of past production work. The meeting was convened with the motivation that in the past, it was always believed that the masses had many concerns in their thinking—such as “fear of joining the collective,” “fear of struggle,” and “fear of burden”—so their production enthusiasm was not high. However, this year, under the conditions of extreme shortage of animal and human power in Qiu County, all cultivated land was hoed once, generally more than before the war. Spare labor was also used to develop sideline industries. The surplus from sideline industries was used to add many fertilizers and livestock. In the first and fourth districts alone, 540 head of cattle, 3,932 pigs, and 2,097 sheep were added, and 5,325 mu of wasteland were reclaimed. The fourth district alone increased its grass fertilizer by 12,900 carts. The number of mutual aid groups in the third district increased by 134 compared to last year. Last year, there were still seven or eight villages in the first district without mutual aid; this year, only two villages remain. This situation shows that the past estimate of the masses' ideological concerns needs to be reconsidered.

    The meeting first studied who exactly had these concerns. Many facts show that the general poor peasants not only were not “afraid of struggle,” but even under the circumstance of the expanded burden this year, when they had just acquired land and had to bear the burden, they did not feel the burden was heavy, and their production enthusiasm was still very high. These concerns only existed in the middle peasant and above components. In Dagoutou, the struggle was more thorough, the feudal forces were basically defeated, and the middle peasants actively participated in the struggle without being harmed themselves. Now the production enthusiasm of both the middle and poor peasants is very high. Although it is a rich village, there is no selling of alcohol or meat on the streets. In Xiaogoutou, during the struggle, the target was not aimed at feudalism, and greater efforts were made to deal with bandit leaders. The rich peasants seized the leadership, and the land reform was extremely incomplete. This year, the production enthusiasm of the middle and poor peasants is not high, there is a lot of selling of alcohol and meat, and waste is serious. The contrast between these two villages shows that if the poor peasants cannot thoroughly turn over, their production enthusiasm will not be high, and therefore they cannot bring up the middle peasants, because only when the poor peasants are active can the middle peasants be stabilized.

    The attendees studied the issue of leadership in detail. The leading cadres of Zhendongbao are mainly poor peasants. They respond to the instructions of higher authorities very resolutely and lead the masses in production very diligently. This village's production achievements are very good. For example, the leaders of Xinzhuang are all middle peasant and above components. They can quickly and beautifully provide statistics when asked for by higher authorities, but they cannot exert efforts to lead the masses in production. This village's production achievements are quite poor.

    In villages where land reform is not thorough, the landlords are not thoroughly struggled against, their prestige has not fallen, and they often talk nonsense and provoke incidents, which has a great impact on the peasants. However, in villages where the struggle is thorough, the landlords are completely defeated, the middle peasants have dispelled the idea of a change of regime, and they can closely rely on the poor peasants. The active production of the poor peasants brings up the middle peasants.

    The meeting then concluded that the concerns mentioned above are only the thoughts of some middle peasants and well-to-do middle peasants. In villages where the struggle is thorough, the demands and actions of middle peasants to develop production and become wealthy are very significant.

    Why did we once regard these concerns as the thoughts of the "masses"? The county and district cadres carefully examined the reasons. In a word, the leadership style was not deep enough. In the past, the leadership did not pay attention to going deep among the poor peasants, and approached mostly village cadres. Many of the village cadres were of middle peasant origin, and they often described their own thoughts as the thoughts of the masses. Many of the county and district cadres were also of middle peasant origin, so they were particularly easy to understand and accept these reflections. Individual well-to-do middle peasants, “afraid of struggle” and “afraid of joining the collective,” often inquired about these things with the district cadres, thus replacing the general with individual cases. The poor peasants, having no concerns, did not speak up and honestly buried themselves in production. Because we did not particularly approach them, we became blind to this positive factor after land reform.

    This situation created a bad consequence. There was a “frame” in thought that "the masses have many ideological concerns," and we often went to specifically collect such materials, hoping to solve problems based on them. The more such materials there were, the less visible the positive factors of the masses became. We were intimidated by the negative and had no positive foundation, so naturally we could not solve the problems. This is why some cadres were unwilling to lead production work and felt that leading production was not interesting. Consequently, some problems also occurred in the guideline of "developing production." We did not fully recognize the demands of the poor peasants and the majority of middle peasants to organize, and we did not dare to actually affirm that organizing is the only way to increase production (especially in Qiu County, an area that has experienced severe disasters and where the vitality of society has not yet recovered). We proposed the guideline of “organizing is okay, not organizing is also okay, as long as production is increased.” This guideline, detached from organizational guarantees, is difficult to achieve.

    In the previous period, the leadership emphasized deeply leading production. Many district-level cadres helped the poor peasants with farm work in the fields and lived with them. These positive factors among the poor peasants were slowly discovered. Many examples of middle peasants relying on poor peasants to actively produce also increasingly emerged. Cadres relied on them to organize mutual aid to "increase production," and obtained some significant achievements. The interest in doing production work immediately increased.

    The attending cadres also studied how to break through the thoughts of this part of the middle peasants and well-to-do middle peasants. After analyzing specific facts, they unanimously agreed that the past educational method of purely persuasion starting from thought itself would not work. During the re-examination, we should pay attention to absorbing them to participate in the struggle. Educate them in the struggle that land reform is "struggling against feudalism," not "struggling against shortcomings," or "struggling against the wealthy." The clearer the class nature in the struggle, the more at ease the middle peasants will be. They will know that they are not feudal, and thus can break the initial concern of "fear of struggle." In production, the poor peasants must grasp the leadership. If the poor peasants work hard in production without any concerns, they can influence and promote the middle peasants to follow. And commend the models of middle peasants who develop production and become wealthy at any time to educate and stimulate other middle peasants. Mutual aid should be greatly developed (because this is the demand of the poor peasants and the majority of middle peasants). The leadership should consciously cultivate several typical examples, carefully calculate accounts to clarify the benefits of mutual aid, absorb those who have not participated to participate, and transform those with shortcomings and problems. Thoroughly implementing the mass line is the basic method, absorbing the active opinions and factors of the majority of poor peasants and middle peasants, and using these opinions as the basis to promote the few who cannot understand. In short, the most powerful method to transform concerned middle peasants is factual education. Let the poor peasants and the unconcerned middle peasants show them the facts, and they will consciously catch up.

    Finally, everyone further discussed a principle: In the future, when judging the thoughts and appeals of the masses, we must first distinguish which class they belong to? Are they universal or the concerns of a few? Think about why these people have these appeals and thoughts? Go deep to the root and then draw a conclusion. The study of ideological problems should go deep among the poor peasants, relying on them to understand the situation of the middle peasants and other classes. This is our class perspective and mass line in our work.

    生产中的阶级观点与群众路线问题
    李庄整理
    邱县县委于十七日召开区书会议，检讨过去对生产工作的领导思想。会议在这样的动机下召开，即过去总认为群众在思想上有许多顾虑——如“怕归伙”、“怕斗争”、“怕负担”等，所以生产情绪不高，而今年邱县在畜力人力非常缺乏的条件下，把全部耕地一般的较战前多锄了一遍，还腾出劳力发展副业，以副业盈余添置许多肥料和牲口，仅一、四两区即增添耕牛五百四十头、猪三千九百三十二只、羊二千零九十七只、开荒五千三百二十五亩。四区只草肥就增加了一万二千九百车。三区的互助组，比去年增加一百三十四个。去年一区还有七、八个村没有互助，今年只剩下了两个村庄。这个情况说明，过去对于群众思想顾虑的那种估计，实有重新考虑的必要。
    会议首先研究上述那些顾虑究竟存在于什么人的身上？许多事实说明：一般贫农不但不“怕斗争”，即在今年负担面扩大，才获得土地就要负担的情况下，也并没有感到负担重，生产情绪还是很高，这些顾虑只存在于中农以上的成份中。大郭头斗争较彻底，封建势力基本垮了，中农积极参加了斗争，自己没有受到损伤，现在中贫农生产情绪都很高，虽是一个富村，街上没有卖酒卖肉。小郭头斗争时，没有把目标对准封建，用了较大的力量做土匪头子，富农纂夺了领导权，土改极不彻底，今年中贫农生产情绪都不高，卖酒卖肉的很多，浪费现象严重。这两个村庄对比，说明贫农不能彻底翻身，生产情绪就不会高，因此也就不能带起中农，因为只有贫农积极了，才能稳定中农。
    到会者详细研究领导权的问题，镇东堡领导干部主要是贫农，他们响应上级号召非常坚决，领导群众生产非常努力，这个村的生产成绩很好。如辛庄的领导者都是中农以上成份，上级问他们要个统计来得快而漂亮，但是却不能用力领导群众生产，这个村的生产成绩就相当坏。
    在土改不彻底的村庄，地主斗的不透，威风未倒，经常胡说八道，挑拨造事，对农民影响极大；但在斗争彻底的村庄，地主完全垮了，中农也就打消了变天思想，而能紧紧的依靠贫农，贫农积极生产就把中农带起来了。
    会议于是得出结论：上面说的那些顾虑，只是一部份中农和富裕中农的思想，在斗争彻底的村庄，中农生产发家的要求与行动都是很显著的。
    为什么过去一度把这些顾虑看作“群众”的思想呢？县区干部们详细检讨原因，一句话，领导作风不够深入，过去领导上不注意深入贫农，接近的多是村干部，村干部中农成份很多，他们常常把自己的思想说成是群众的思想，县区干部中农成份也相当多，对于这些反映也就特别容易了解与接受，个别富裕中农“怕斗”“怕归伙”，常向区干部们打听这些事情，遂把个别情况代替了一般，贫农没有顾虑不说话，老老实实埋头生产，就是因为没有特别接近他们，所以对于土改后这种积极因素，竟至弄得熟视无睹。
    这种情况造成了一种恶果，思想上有了个“群众有许多思想顾虑”的框子，常常去专门搜集这种材料，希望据以解决问题。这种材料越来越多，群众的积极因素越来越看不见，被消极的吓住，没有积极的作基础，自然解决不了。一部份干部不愿意领导生产工作，觉得领导生产没有兴趣，就是这个原故。在“发展生产”的方针上，也因而发生了。一些问题，没有充分认识贫农及大部中农组织起来的要求，也就不敢在实际上肯定组织起来是增加生产（特别在邱县这种经过严重灾荒，社会元气还未恢复的地区）的唯一道路，而提出“组织起来也行，不组织起来也行，只要增产就行”的方针，这种方针脱离了组织保证，也就难于实现了。
    前一时期，领导上强调深入领导生产，许多区级干部到地里帮助贫农作活，和他们生活在一起，贫农中这些积极因素慢慢被发现，中农依靠贫农积极生产的许多事例，也与日俱增的显现出来，干部依靠他们组织互助“增加生产”，获得一些显著成绩，搞生产工作的兴趣马上就提高了。
    到会的干部们，又研究怎样打通这一部份中农及富裕中农的思想，分析了具体事实以后，一致认为过去那种从思想本身出发，单纯说服的教育方法不行，在复查的时候，应注意吸收他们参加斗争，从斗争中教育他们土改是“斗封建”，不是“斗缺点”，“斗有”，斗争时的阶级性越明确，中农越安心，他们自己会晓得自己并非封建，因此可打破“怕斗争”的初步顾虑。在生产中一定要贫农掌握领导权，贫农自己毫无顾虑的努力生产，即可影响与推动中农跟上走，并随时表扬中农生产发家的模范，以教育与刺激其他中农，互助要大量发展（因为这是贫农及大部中农的要求），领导上有意识的培养若干典型，勤算帐以明确互助的好处，吸收未参加者参加，并改造有缺点有问题者。贯澈群众路线是基本的方法，吸收贫农中农中大多数的积极意见与因素，以这些意见为根据，推动少数想不通者。总之，改造有顾虑的中农，最有力的方法是事实教育，让贫农及无顾虑的中农拿出事实让他们看看，他们就会自觉的赶了上来。
    最后，大家进一步讨论了一条原则：今后判断群众的思想与呼声，要首先区别是那个阶层的？是普遍的还是少数人的？想想这些人为什么有这种呼声与思想？深入追根再下结论，研究思想问题应该深入到贫农中，依靠他们了解中农与其他阶层的情况，这就是我们工作中的阶级观点与群众路线。
