　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 12th: Rome dispatch: The wave of general strikes by Italian workers protesting the authorities' reactionary economic policies is spreading rapidly. As of the 11th, the number of strikers has exceeded 1.1 million. Following the general strike in mid-August, 800,000 workers in the industrial area of the Po River basin in northern Italy, under the leadership of the Italian General Confederation of Labor, launched another strike on the 8th to protest the authorities' economic policies and high prices. In response to the general strike by 800,000 workers in the Po River basin, 300,000 agricultural workers, technicians, and clerical staff in northern Italy also joined the strike on the 11th, demanding the abolition of reactionary economic policies and improved treatment for the starving. The labor unrest has spread to all sectors of agriculture in northern Italy. Many agricultural strikers in the provinces of Piedmont, etc., have stated that they want to harvest the rice, but they only want to transport it to relieve the poor and are unwilling to hand it over to the landlords. The strike of 800,000 people in the Po River basin has already alarmed the heads of the ruling Christian Democratic Party's guiding committee, who hurriedly convened an emergency meeting on the 9th to discuss countermeasures. The committee called the strike an "offensive by left-wing parties." An Associated Press dispatch on the 9th stated: "The pressure from the left-wing parties (i.e., the Communist Party and the Socialist Party), which were ousted from the cabinet in May, is increasing on the De Gasperi authorities." The dispatch also revealed the panic of the US ambassador to Italy, De Gasperi's backstage boss, stating that the embassy "will launch a slogan and radio contest to promote American 'aid' to Italy, offsetting the pressure from the left," in an attempt to save De Gasperi's crumbling rule. However, the wave of strikes is rising daily, causing extreme anxiety to US imperialism. According to a United Press dispatch: "The situation in Italy has now become Marshall's top priority." The dispatch also revealed that the US ambassador to Italy has warned Washington: "The Italian situation is not a matter to be considered in months, but an urgent matter to be decided in weeks," and strongly advocated: "Using force to deal with it" when necessary.

　　意工潮飞速增涨百余万人大罢工
    【新华社陕北十二日电】罗马讯：意大利工人抗议当局反动经济政策的大罢工风潮，正飞速蔓延中，迄十一日止，罢工人数已突破一百十万人。继八月中旬的大罢工后，在意大利总工会领导下，意大利北部波河流域工业区八十万工人于八日再举罢工义旗，抗议当局的经济政策及物价高涨。为响应波河流域八十万工人的大罢工义举，北意三十万农业工人、技师及书记人员，又于十一日参加罢工，要求废止反动的经济政策和改善饥饿的待遇。工潮已扩及北意农业的一切部门。毕尔蒙等省的许多农业罢工工人都表示：他们要收获稻米，但他们只愿将这些稻米运去救济穷人，而不愿交与地主。波河流域八十万人的罢工，就已使专政的基督教民主党指导委员会的首脑们惊慌失措，急忙于九日召开紧急会议，商讨对策。该委员会称：此次罢工为“左翼党派的攻势”。美联社九日电称：“今年五月被摒除出阁的左翼党派（按即共产党与社会党）对加斯贝利当局的压力日益增长。”该电并泄露加斯贝利的后台主人驻意美大使的慌乱称：使馆“将发起一个标语与广播的竞赛，以宣传美国对意的‘援助’，抵销左翼的压力”，企图以此拯救加斯贝利摇摇欲坠的统治。然而罢工浪潮却日益高涨，更引起美帝国主义的极度焦急。据合众社电：“意国局势现已成为马歇尔的第一项大问题”。该电并透露：美驻意大使已向华府提出警告：“认为意大利局势非数月内考虑之问题，而系数周间决定之迫切事项。”并力主：在必要时“施用武力对付”。
