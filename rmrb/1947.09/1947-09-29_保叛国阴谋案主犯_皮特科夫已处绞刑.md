Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 25th: Sofia dispatch: Petkov, the chief culprit in the Bulgarian treason conspiracy case and former leader of the Agrarian Union, was executed by hanging in Sofia on the 23rd. After being sentenced to death on August 16th, Petkov appealed again, but the Sofia Court of Appeal upheld the original verdict after a retrial. The reactionary political organization led by Petkov, the Agrarian Union, was also dissolved by a special meeting of the Bulgarian National Assembly. From the time of Petkov's appeal to the retrial, the governments of the United States and the United Kingdom jointly lodged unreasonable protests with the Soviet government several times, demanding a tripartite trial of the Petkov case in an attempt to save Petkov's life. After the Soviet side insisted on the principle of non-interference in internal affairs and sternly refuted them, their treacherous plot failed.

    保叛国阴谋案主犯
    皮特科夫已处绞刑
    【新华社陕北二十五日电】索菲亚讯：保加利亚叛国阴谋案主犯，前农民联盟领袖皮特科夫，已于二十三日在索菲亚被处以绞刑。皮逆于八月十六日被叛死刑后，曾再度上诉，经索菲亚上诉院重审后仍维持原判。皮逆领导之反动政治组织农民联盟亦经保国民议会特别会议决定解散。自皮逆上诉至复审期间，美英两国政府曾数度向苏政府联合提出无理抗议，要求三国会审皮案，企图为皮逆救命。经苏方坚持不干涉内政之原则，而予以严正驳斥后，奸计未售。
