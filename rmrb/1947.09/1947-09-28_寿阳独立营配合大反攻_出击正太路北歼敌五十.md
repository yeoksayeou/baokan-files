    Shouyang Independent Battalion Cooperates with the Great Counter-Offensive, Attacks North of the Zhengtai Railway, Annihilating Fifty Enemies
    [Our Newspaper Taihang, 22nd Dispatch] The Shouyang Independent Battalion, a banner of guerrilla warfare in central Shanxi, in order to cooperate with the southward counter-offensive army, at 6:00 PM on the 18th, raided the Yan bandit stronghold of Bailintou (northeast of Yuci) north of the Zhengtai Railway. After a half-hour of fierce fighting, the stronghold was captured, and a part of the Yan bandit "Revenge Team" was annihilated. At around 7:00 PM, more than 30 members of the "Struggle Regiment" stationed in Shitie Town came to reinforce, but they were also routed by us. It is estimated that 20 enemies were killed or wounded, and more than 30 were captured alive. Two small cannons, one light machine gun, seven rifles and carbines, and 15 head of livestock were seized. We suffered no casualties, our enemy's losses were zero to fifty.
