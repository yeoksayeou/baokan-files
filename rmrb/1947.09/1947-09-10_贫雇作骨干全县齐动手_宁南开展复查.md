　　【Jinan, Hebei, 8th Dispatch】Ningnan has entered the re-examination phase. Following the county-wide district cadre conference, on August 21st, the districts convened village-level meetings of poor and hired peasant activists. They swore oaths before Chairman Mao's portrait, and the Fourth District even drank "united heart wine." Everyone swiftly returned to their villages, and at midnight, upon a signal, they simultaneously captured targets for struggle. Every village achieved victory, with a total of 2,378 landlord and feudal rich peasant households detained county-wide, with no more than five escaping the net. All landlord households were sealed, and cadres and the masses beamed with joy. At dawn, the Fourth District held celebration meetings in every village, reading out the proclamation of offering "stolen goods" (items stored for landlords), emphasizing that offering "stolen goods" was honorable and would be recorded positively, while concealing "stolen goods" was shameful and would be recorded negatively. Good members should establish merit for the farmers' association, and those who reported "stolen goods" for traitors and collaborators could have their "traitor" label removed and their "black skin" peeled off. A wave of offering "stolen goods" immediately swept through the villages. It was also clearly stated that re-examination and production should not be neglected; production would take place in the fields in the morning, and re-examination in the afternoon. In the arrest of landlords, the militia demonstrated a firm class stance. The landlord of Fengjiatai village attempted to bribe the militia to escape the people's justice. When militia member Zhang Quanji captured Chu Kuiduo, Chu Kuiduo's mother said in a mean tone, "Quanji, hold my child for me, so I can tighten my waist," and attempted to hand over a pair of gold bracelets. Enraged, Quanji slapped them away and immediately reported it to the farmers' association. "Mad dogs under heaven all bite 'people.'" Landlords from other villages hiding in this village were also to be captured. That evening, Gengzhuangqiao detained Chu Jingui, a large landlord from Houxinlizhuang, Qi Jingfu, a landlord from Longping, and a landlord from Zaoyuan. The next day, villages exchanged landlords, truly demonstrating that "poor people under heaven are of one heart, and landlords cannot move a single step." The militia strictly managed the landlords. Cunning landlords, knowing they were doomed, indulged in excessive eating and drinking, and some wrote letters using children to send to relatives and friends to help them disperse their property. Upon discovery, each village immediately established an impartial "guard squad," detaining the landlord's entire family, old and young. Except for going to the toilet, no one was allowed to leave the house, cry and whine pretending to be innocent, receive visitors, ask others to intercede, or cook their own food; meals were cooked in large pots, and each person was given four ounces of rice per meal. Everything the landlords owned was the blood and sweat of the masses, so the masses said, "Giving them four ounces is already too much; when we begged for food, they wouldn't give us a single bit." Upon detaining the landlords, a movement to recover stolen goods was launched, calling for self-reporting and self-offering. The masses of Zhao village immediately handed over half a room of packages hidden for the landlord. The "Thoroughly Liberated Committee" was established in the East Wang three towns of the Fourth District, divided into an "Fruits Group" for the clear-cut, an "Guard Class" that knows no mercy, a "Sweep Team" that does not recognize relatives, a "Interrogation Class" that is hard-hearted, an "Stolen Goods Retrieval Team" which checks every house, and a "Record Good-Record Bad Group" based on fair sixteen ounces, each with specific responsibilities. On the night of the 21st, one hundred and thirty-three landlord and feudal rich peasant households were captured overnight in East Town. With the Re-examination begun, on the 23rd, in one day East Town recovered 110 silver dollars, 10,300 catties of wheat, 727 quilts and packages, and many other miscellaneous items from the homes of six landlords. After ideological breakthroughs, a movement to return stolen goods was launched. Thirty-three households in East Town were registered as standing up positively, and twenty-nine people handed over 480 quilts, clothes, and packages. Tian Guirong and Lu Dakui offered a mule and over 10,000 Jicha banknotes. Song Erpang and He Laosuo found a landlord's ox and a hardware store, and each was awarded a certificate of merit. The director of the public security officer was deemed insufficiently responsible and was immediately recorded negatively. One hundred and fifty-three households in West Town and South Town reported that twenty-three households had stored landlords' belongings, including fifty-eight packages, nine hundred silver dollars, seven gold rings, three gold pendants, and thirty-six pearls.
