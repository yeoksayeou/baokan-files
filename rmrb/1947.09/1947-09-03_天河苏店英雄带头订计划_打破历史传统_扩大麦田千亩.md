[From Our Changzhi Correspondent] In the past, Sudian in Tianhe rarely grew wheat. Those who did plant wheat only cultivated a small plot, and some families didn't grow it at all. Although progress has been made since liberation under the government's call, the following ideas still exist: (1) Sudian had "one mu of garden worth ten mu of field," belittling wheat planting and valuing garden cultivation; (2) Wheat doesn't grow well in Changzhi; (3) Changzhi is prone to hailstorms, and people are afraid of damage; (4) Some people are simply too lazy to move, using excuses like being too busy with harvesting hemp, processing indigo, and watering cabbage. Therefore, accumulating fertilizer and planting wheat hasn't been taken seriously. Tianhe hero Cao Linshui, after rectifying mutual aid, put forward his wheat planting plan for the work-exchange team at the commendation meeting, saying: "Our team originally had 220 mu of wheat land, and we will add another 100 mu. I have this experience: planting wheat on mountain slopes doesn't necessarily mean less grain. Because mountain slopes have high grass and many thorns, plowing the land three times a year after planting wheat prevents the grass from growing. When the grass comes out in the spring, the wheat is already big, so the wheat can grow very well. On decent land, one mu can yield one dan. We plan to reclaim twenty mu of wasteland for wheat planting, and we have already reclaimed thirteen mu. Each mu of land will be fertilized with at least sixty loads of manure. This way, we estimate we can harvest one hundred dan of wheat in the spring, which can help us get through the lean season." After his merit-based plan was discussed in various groups, it was decided that the entire village would expand wheat fields by 200 mu, accounting for one-half of the original area, which can harvest 200 dan of wheat. Each household will increase its income by an average of one shi, four dou, and six sheng, and each person will increase their income by three dou, four sheng, and two ge, enough for a month's consumption. Regarding fertilizer accumulation, in addition to the existing 10,260 loads and 1,500 loads of night soil, there are still 150 mu of land lacking fertilizer. A goal has been set to accumulate another 10,000 loads of fertilizer, and an effort is currently underway to achieve this, with a target completion date of the fifteenth day of the lunar calendar, and delivery to the fields. Under the leadership of Sudian hero Bi Eryun, it was proposed that other areas are suffering severe disasters, and our harvest here has also been reduced. Is it enough to just economize? After discussion, everyone agreed that we must expand production. The whole village decided to convert 720 mu of hemp land, millet land, yam land, and alfalfa land, which together with the previous land, expands the wheat fields by more than a thousand mu. At the same time, it was proposed that we must apply at least half as much fertilizer as last year. (Sheng Xiu, Han Qing, Ling Yi, Qing He)

[From Our Changzhi Correspondent] The entire county has generally finished weeding the autumn seedlings three times. Each district held an enlarged meeting of more than 1,500 district and village cadres and activists on the 8th and 9th of last month to mobilize fertilizer accumulation and increased production, expand wheat fields, and rectify mutual aid. All villages in the county have universally launched the above three major movements. In the third district, Beixianquan, under the active promotion of party members in the branch, launched a fertilizer accumulation campaign. Branch Secretary Song Jinfa personally visited his own group to understand their thoughts and calculate the labor-saving benefits, educating everyone. The group members clarified the benefits of mutual aid. After rectifying mutual aid, they discussed how to increase production. His group has fifteen full and semi-able-bodied laborers. Except for two who sell eggs as a sideline, one carpenter, and three coal sellers responsible for plowing wheat land, the rest are all focused on accumulating fertilizer. They also established a method of recording work points and rewarding dividends: cutting 120 jin of Artemisia annua counts as one work point, scraping ten cartloads of wall soil counts as one work point. Transportation is handled within the group, and in addition to rewarding 20% of the profits, the labor is divided 80/20 between the labor force and the cooperative, and the carpenter earns seven parts labor and three parts dividends. After these specific methods were stipulated, his group scraped sixty cartloads of wall soil in half a day. After Branch Secretary Song Jinfa introduced his group's methods to the entire village, he also led the entire village to accumulate fertilizer. According to two-day statistics, 2,470 cartloads of wall soil and 980 jin of Artemisia annua were cut. In Xingzhuang Village, in the third district, Jia Dasheng's group collectively accumulated fertilizer and collectively distributed manure, ensuring that even the land of widows had fertilizer. In seven days, they cut 5,100 jin of Artemisia annua. The method is to first evaluate and assign work points for the tasks, and issue the corresponding amount of vouchers for what has been done. Widows are engaged in weaving for work exchange, and manure is distributed according to the vouchers. After rectifying mutual aid and summarizing the mid-year production evaluation and awarding models, Beisongbi village set a production increase plan, reclaiming fifteen mu of wasteland and cutting 2,000 jin of Artemisia annua in three days from the 16th to the 18th. It also promptly commended four models of fertilizer accumulation and increased production, which rapidly promoted the fertilizer accumulation movement throughout the village. Regarding production increase, Taiyizhen in the fifth district immediately discussed how to increase production after weeding the seedlings three times. The masses discussed and said: "This year there is more rain, so next year's wheat will yield more." A plan was formulated to plant more wheat and accumulate more fertilizer, ensuring that not a single mu of land is left idle. Last year, the village had 180 mu of wheat land, and this year it will double to 360 mu, increasing fertilizer by forty dan per mu, guaranteeing up to one hundred dan. After discussing production increase, Baocun in the third district plans to plant 97 mu of 169 wheat this year, more than double last year's wheat land, and plans to plant 620 mu this year. In Zifang, in the first district, influenced by Ma Qirong's group increasing production and reclaiming thirty mu of wasteland, the whole village converted 200 mu of hemp to wheat. The Beisai district discussed expanding wheat fields, and six villages set a production increase plan, expanding 2,030 mu of wheat fields. Zhangtou Village proposed to plow one more time this year. Statistics from the 10th to the 20th show: in ten days, four villages accumulated 23,080 jin of fertilizer and cut Artemisia annua, scraped 2,470 cartloads of wall soil, and composted 4,400 dan of wasteland. Increase production: Statistics from ten villages show that they have reclaimed 45 mu of wasteland and expanded wheat fields by 2,850 mu. The achievement of these results is mainly due to the leading role of branch party members and heroic models, which vigorously promoted the fertilizer accumulation and production increase movement.

　　天河苏店英雄带头订计划
  　打破历史传统　扩大麦田千亩
    【本报长治讯】天河苏店历史上不多种麦，种麦子的，一户也仅种几分，甚至有的就干脆不种。解放后虽在政府号召下，进展不小，但思想上还存在有：（１）苏店“一亩园十亩田”，轻视种麦，重视种园地；（２）长治就不长麦子；（３）长治容易下冰雹，怕打掉；（４）还有人懒的不想动弹，借口现在杀麻打靛浇白菜顾不来等，所以积肥种麦就没有当成会事。天河英雄曹林水，在整顿互助后，贺功大会上，订出他的变工大队种麦计划，说：“我们队里原有麦地二百二十亩，再加一百亩，我有这个经验：山岭地种麦并不少收粮，因为山岭地草地高圪针多，种上麦子一年犁上三遍，草长不起来，春天草出来，麦子大了，所以麦子很能长好，差不多的地，一亩就能打一石，我们计划开荒种麦二十亩，现开成了十三亩，每亩地至少上肥六十担，这样春天估计能收一百石麦子，就能渡过青黄不接之时。”经过他的立功计划，在各组展开讨论，订出全村要扩大麦田二百亩，占原有二分之一，能收麦子二百石，每户平均增加收入一石四斗六升，每人平均三斗四升二合，能够一月吃。积肥方面，原有一万零二百六十担，圊一千五百担，还空一百五十亩地肥订出再积肥一万担为奋斗目标，现已突击干起来，并订出阴历十五日完成，并送到地里。苏店在英雄毕二云领导下，提出别的区域灾荒很严重，咱们这里基本上也降低了收成，光节约行不行？大家讨论，一致认为要扩大生产，全村订出改麻地、黍地、山药蛋地、小兰地七百二十亩，连前共扩大麦田千余亩，同时提出一定比去年多上一半肥。（生秀、汉清、令意、清河）
    【本报长治讯】全县秋苗普遍锄完三遍，各区先后于上月八、九两天，召开了一千五百余人的区村干部、积极分子，扩大会议，动员积肥增产，扩大麦田，整顿互助，全县所有村庄普遍开展了以上三大运动。三区北仙泉在支部党员的积极推动下，开展了积肥运动，支书宋金发同志亲手先从自己小组进行访心思，算省工帐，教育了大家，组员明确了互助互利，经过整顿互助后，讨论如何增产。他组有全半劳力十五个，除二个贩鸡蛋做副业外，一个木匠，三个卖煤负责犁麦地，剩下全部突击积肥。并订出折记工、奖励分红办法：割一百二十斤蒿为一工，刮十大车墙土为一工，运输吃组内，赚利除十分之二奖励外，劳八资二分社，木匠赚下是工七农三分红。经这些办法具体规定后，他组半天刮墙土六十车。支书宋金发同志组办法给全村介绍后，又领导全村突击积肥，据二天统计，刮墙土二千四百七十车，割蒿九百八十斤。三区幸庄村，贾大盛组集体积肥，集体分粪，做到了寡妇地里也有粪，七天割蒿五千一百斤。办法是先把活的工评订起来，做了多少，发多少分票，寡妇是纺织变工，分粪时按分票分。北宋壁经过整顿互助，总结半年生产评选表模后，全村订出了增产计划，从十六到十八三天开了荒地十五亩，割蒿二千斤；并及时的表扬积肥增产模范四名，这样使全村的积肥运动迅速的开展起来。增产方面，五区太义镇锄完三遍苗后，立即就讨论如何增产，群众纷纷议论说：“今年雨水多，明年麦多收”。订出了多种麦，多积肥计划，保证不闲一亩地，去年全村有麦地一百八十亩，今年要增加一倍，共种三百六十亩，每亩增肥四十担，保证上到一百担。三区鲍村讨论增产后，今年要种一六九小麦九十七亩，麦地超过去年二倍还强，今年要种六百廿亩。一区紫坊在马起荣组增产开荒三十亩的影响下，全村改麻种麦二百亩。北塞小区讨论扩大麦田，六个村订出增产计划，扩大二千零三十亩麦田。漳头村提出今年要多犁一遍，从十号到二十号，十天的成绩统计：四村积肥割蒿二万三千零八十斤，刮墙土二千四百七十车，薰荒四千四百担。增产：十个村统计，开荒四十五亩，扩大麦田二千八百五十亩。这些成绩的获得，主要是支部党员英雄模范的带头及表模使积肥增产运动猛烈开展。（联合办公室）
