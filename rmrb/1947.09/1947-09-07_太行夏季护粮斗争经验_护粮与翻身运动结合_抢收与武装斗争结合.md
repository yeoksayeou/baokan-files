　　Taihang Summer Grain Protection Struggle Experience
  　Combining Grain Protection with the Turn-Over Movement
    Combining Seizure with Armed Struggle
    [Reported from Taihang on the 4th of this month] With the autumn harvest approaching and the enemy besieged in "isolated island" strongholds like Taiyuan, Shijiazhuang, Anyang, Xinxiang, and Jiaozuo, facing a severe grain supply crisis, this autumn's grain protection struggle is bound to be even more complex and acute. Here is a review of the summer grain protection struggle experience in this region for reference in the upcoming autumn grain protection struggle. This summer, in the newly recovered areas, the grain protection struggle was integrated with the peasant turn-over movement. Addressing the demands of the impoverished peasants and farm laborers on the front lines of hunger, slogans such as "Anti-Traitor Great Purge" and "Distributing Wheat and Land Again" were put forward. After mobilizing the backbone of the poor peasants and farm laborers, cadres or work teams relied on base points to convene mass meetings, supporting the masses and making decisions for them, clearly telling the masses: the land and wheat belong to us peasants, and future harvests will go into our mouths and our granaries. The masses immediately arrested the landlords, settling accounts in the morning and harvesting wheat in the afternoon. The masses happily organized their own militia, saying: "Young people should hold the enemy at the front, and we, men and women, will work together to harvest." This achieved the integration of grain protection and the turn-over movement. In the occupied areas temporarily invaded by the enemy, armed work teams were organized to penetrate deep into the inner lines, unite with the masses, resolutely suppress landlords who sought to reverse the land reforms, write slogans, and carry out political offensives: "Anyone who attempts to take back a grain of wheat from the peasants will have their head cut off." In the KMT-controlled areas, we should organize riots for emergency harvesting, calling on the peasants: "If you don't seize the harvest, you will starve to death; those who want to live, follow me!" and organize guerrilla forces to coordinate and support the KMT areas, containing the grain-grabbing enemy. In the border areas, we can organize a combination of labor and military force, with the militia and the masses exchanging labor and land, disrupting the harvest. The militia is responsible for the front line, and the masses are responsible for the rear line. The militia in the rear line or hinterland can organize a large number of guerrilla work teams to rush to the front line and cooperate with the armed grain protection actions. When there is no conflict, everyone seizes the harvest; when there is war, the seizure team immediately becomes a combat team. Tactically, we should widely use landmines combined with sniper warfare, hornet warfare, joint defense warfare, etc. In short, make the enemy afraid to act rashly. In addition, in the armed struggle, we must seize the time and take the initiative, organize widespread attacks, and preemptively strike the enemy, disrupting their plans and deployments. We mainly rely on a well-trained armed force to penetrate deep into the "security zones," destroy the puppet organizations, and disrupt the enemy's administrative organization, preventing it from coordinating with the enemy's grain grabbing, thereby hindering the enemy's actions. After we have gained the initiative, we should quickly shift the focus of the struggle to the enemy's heartland, preventing the grain protection struggle from becoming bogged down in the guerrilla zone.

　　太行夏季护粮斗争经验
  　护粮与翻身运动结合
    抢收与武装斗争结合
    【本报太行四日电】秋禾即将成熟，在困守太原、石门、安阳、新乡、焦作等“孤岛”据点之敌人，粮食供应严重恐慌下，今秋护粮斗争势必更加复杂化与尖锐化。现将本区夏季护粮斗争经验回顾一下，以供今秋护粮斗争参考。今夏在新收复区，护粮斗争是和农民翻身运动结合在一起的。针对当时辗转在饥饿第一线的贫雇农民要求，提出了“反奸大清算”、“分麦又分田”等口号，发动贫雇骨干后，干部或工作组即依托基点，召开群众大会，给群众撑腰作主，明白告诉群众：地和麦，都是咱们农民的，以后的收成，就要进咱的嘴，入咱的囤。群众立刻把地主都扣起，上午清算，下午就割麦。群众高兴的组织了自己的民兵，说：“年轻人到前方好好顶住敌人，咱男女齐下手收割。”做到了护粮与翻身结合。被敌人暂时侵占的沦陷区，组织武工队深入内线，结合群众，坚决镇压倒算地主，写标语喊口号，进行政攻，“谁要倒算农民一粒麦，我们就割他一颗头。”在蒋管区，应组织暴动抢收，号召农民“不抢收就要饿死，要活命的跟我来！”并组织游击武装，前往蒋区配合支援，牵制抢粮敌人。边地护粮斗争中，可组织劳武结合，民兵群众变工换地，打乱收割，民兵负责前沿地带，群众负责后一线。后一线或腹地民兵，可大量组织游击拨工队，赶赴前沿，配合护粮武装行动，无事大家抢收，一有战争，抢收队即变为参战组。在战术上，应大量采用地雷结合冷枪战、黄蜂战、联防战等。总之，使敌人不敢轻举妄动。此外，在武装斗争上，一定要争取时间，争取主动，组织广泛出击，预先打击敌人，打乱其计划布署。主要靠精干武装深入“治安区”，摧垮伪组织，使敌伪行政组织机构秩序混乱，不能发挥配合敌抢粮作用，以利我牵制敌人行动。待我争取主动后，即应迅速把斗争焦点推向敌之腹心区，不使护粮斗争胶着在游击地带。
