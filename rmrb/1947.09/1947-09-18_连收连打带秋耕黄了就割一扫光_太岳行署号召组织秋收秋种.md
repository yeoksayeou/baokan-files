(From our newspaper Taiyue, 16th) The Taiyue Administrative Office today issued a call to combat heroes, labor heroes, and all cadres in the region, urging them to immediately mobilize and organize the autumn harvest and autumn planting. It stated: We must organize. Cadres at all levels of the government and the people, all kinds of labor experts, and emancipated heroes should actively participate in labor mutual aid, expand the labor force, and mobilize all auxiliary labor, including women, children, and the elderly, to form a large army of labor mutual aid and actively participate in the autumn harvest and wheat planting work. The land of military dependents and martyrs' families, as well as militiamen and laborers on expeditions, should be given priority and harvested and planted on time. At the beginning of the autumn harvest, arrangements should be made as early as possible according to the maturity of the crops. Strict division of labor should be implemented for harvesting, carrying, and threshing according to the size of the labor force and harvesting skills, from the combination of people to the combination of courtyards, the combination of land, and the combination of threshing grounds. When wheat planting arrives, the elderly and oxen should be the center. When sowing, stubble should be the center. Various mutual aid brigades and mutual aid groups should at this time be transformed into temporary wheat planting groups for a concentrated planting effort. In areas lacking seeds, the government and cooperatives should do everything possible to coordinate and exchange wheat seeds. In order to encourage the expansion of wheat fields, the decision to eliminate fallow land and not impose burdens within one year should be effectively publicized. Strengthen the combination of labor and military affairs, and launch an autumn harvest and wheat planting defense war, truly achieving "grab a little grain, return a little blood," and "take a grain of rice, lose a life." In the new areas where land reform is underway, some time should also be set aside for autumn cultivation and harvesting, so as not to miss the farming season. It then pointed out: Leaders at all levels should regard the autumn harvest and wheat planting as the central task, vigorously organize a concentrated effort. All organs, groups, and schools should organize forces to help the masses in nearby villages with autumn harvest and wheat planting free of charge. In short, we must seize the time, vigorously organize the autumn harvest and wheat planting work, launch a mass meritorious service campaign, mobilize individuals and soldiers, villages and villages, units and units, mutual aid groups and mutual aid groups to establish meritorious service plans, and launch a meritorious service competition to successfully complete the autumn harvest and wheat planting tasks.
