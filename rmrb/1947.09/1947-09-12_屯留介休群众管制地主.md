　　【This dispatch from Taiyue, 10th】The masses in Jiexiu and Tuntun in northern Yue strictly control the landlords and those who are struggled against, to prevent rumors, sabotage, and even assassination. The Jiexiu masses, recalling that over the past year, many treacherous and hegemonic landlords organized "Struggle Groups" and "Revenge Teams," brutally murdering over a hundred cadres and emancipated peasants, have come to recognize the reactionary and vicious nature of the landlords. Therefore, they are implementing control over the landlords and those who are struggled against. The measures are: (1) The landlord must provide a bond and find a guarantor to ensure that no problems arise; (2) No landlord is allowed to go near enemy strongholds; (3) Landlords must obtain approval from the Farmers' Association and a travel permit before leaving the village, and if they do not return after the expiration date, the peasant congress will deal with them severely; (4) In the event of enemy activity, the landlord must be transferred first; (5) During the control period, no landlord has civil rights and must unconditionally accept the control of the peasants. Several landlords in the original village of Tuntun were engaging in suspicious activities and trying to evade labor service by infiltrating various organs and production departments. The Farmers' Association convened a membership meeting on the 23rd of last month to discuss measures for controlling landlords. Everyone unanimously decided: (1) All landlords should be organized into groups and strictly controlled. If they want to go out, they must ask the group leader for leave. Emancipated peasants Gao Yunting and others were elected as control group leaders; (2) The Farmers' Association and the control group leaders should regularly check the number of men and women in the landlord's family; (3) When a landlord goes out, the travel permit should clearly state "struggle target" so that peasants can monitor their actions everywhere.

　　屯留介休
  　群众管制地主
    【本报太岳十日电】岳北介休、屯留群众严格管制地主斗争对象，防止造谣破坏甚至暗杀。介休群众回顾一年不少奸霸地主组织了“奋斗团”“复仇队”，惨杀了百余干部与翻身农民，认识了地主的反动毒辣。因此对地主斗争对象实行管制，办法是：（一）地主必须具结，找保人，保证其不出任何问题；（二）不许任何地主到敌据点附近；（三）地主出村必须经农会批准，发路条才可行动，如过期不归者，则由农民大会严格处理；（四）有敌情，地主必须先转移；（五）管制期间，任何地主没有公民权，并得无条件接受农民管制。屯留原村几个地主，与人鬼鬼捣捣的，并钻进各机关生产部门逃避支差，农会于上月二十三日召开会员大会，讨论管制地主办法大家一致决定：（一）将所有地主皆编入小组，严格管制，如要出门必须向小组长请假。翻身农民高云亭等被选为管制小组长；（二）农会与管制小组长要经常检查地主家庭男女人数；（三）地主出门，路条上并写清为“斗争对象”，以便农民到处监视其行动。
