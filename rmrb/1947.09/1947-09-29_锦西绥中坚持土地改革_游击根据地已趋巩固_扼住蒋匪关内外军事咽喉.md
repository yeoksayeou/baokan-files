Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 27th. Our correspondent recently commented on the situation of the guerrilla base areas in Jinxi and Suizhong, west of the Beining Railway, a key military area and industrial center of Chiang Kai-shek's troops outside Shanhaiguan, amidst the victories in eastern Rehe and western Liaoning: Suizhong and Jinxi counties in the eastern Rehe and western Liaoning sub-districts of our Hebei-Chahar-Rehe-Liaoning liberated area are important military areas for Chiang Kai-shek's troops inside and outside Shanhaiguan and a base for invading eastern Rehe. They are often garrisoned by one to three divisions of enemy troops, dotted with strongholds, and subjected to frequent "sweeps." Large and small bandits, reactionary landlord armed groups, secret societies, and beggar gangs also frequently harass the area, making the struggle extremely brutal. Over the past year, the armed forces in this area have combined with the people, persisted in guerrilla warfare, carried out land reform, mobilized the masses, and created solid guerrilla base areas, paving the way for the two recent great victories.

    Jinxi is close to Jinzhou and, along with Huludao, is an important military area for Chiang Kai-shek's troops, surrounded by large and small strongholds. In addition to the enemy's regular army, there are also more than twenty gangs of bandits, including those led by He Jingxing and Hou Guobin, as well as beggar gangs, and open or secret societies from Xingcheng and Chaoyang, constantly harassing the Jinxi area in coordination with the enemy. This area is a junction of Jinzhou, Lingyuan, Xingcheng, Jinxi, and Chaoyang counties, with convenient external transportation. There are highways to Chao(yang), Ling(yuan), and Ye(baishou). During the enemy puppet era, Jinxi was a second-class industrial area. In mid-May of last year, after the Liaoxi Detachment captured Xinlümen, cadres mobilized the masses in the area to open up base areas and continuously fought with enemy troops, bandits, beggar gangs, etc. They twice crushed the enemy's "sweeps" in December last year and January this year, and also captured the Nanpiao stronghold. After conducting a major review and expanding the army in April this year, the troops have become increasingly strong, the base areas have become increasingly consolidated, and have expanded to seven districts and 197 administrative villages. Land reform has been carried out in more than 80 villages, and 14,000 mu of land has been returned to impoverished farmers. After the masses obtained land, their enthusiasm for joining the army was extremely high. Over the past year, the total number has reached more than 1,400. The soldiers and civilians have fought a total of 350 battles. Yang Qingqi, the head of the county detachment, is not afraid of hardship and is brave and resourceful, and has established a reputation in the Jinxi area. Small groups of Chiang Kai-shek's troops, secret societies, and beggar gangs are all terrified.

    Suizhong is one of the border counties of the eastern Rehe and western Liaoning sub-districts. Our guerrillas were active there during the War of Resistance Against Japan. Now our democratic decrees can reach the coast of the Bohai Sea. The county governs eight administrative districts, and land reform has been carried out in 150 villages. After entering the major review in March this year, the masses have gained great victories. According to statistics from 26 villages, they have obtained 5,600 mu of land and 300 head of draft animals. During the review, 35 villages organized labor exchange teams, and 11 villages established cooperatives. Under the slogan of defending the fruits of liberation, the masses actively joined the army. Over the past year, more than 1,300 people have voluntarily joined the main force.

    The important reason for the creation and growth of the base areas in Jinxi and Suizhong counties is that they have persisted in land reform, boldly mobilized the masses, and constantly cultivated new forces. Their characteristic is to implement the idea of "counties not leaving counties, districts not leaving districts," closely combining land reform with military struggle, and earnestly cultivating and educating activists to form fighting fortresses with village branches as the core. As a result, the base areas have a foundation, and when the time is right, they can cooperate with the main force to annihilate the enemy in large numbers and cut off the Beining Railway, the main supply line for Chiang Kai-shek's troops inside and outside Shanhaiguan.

    锦西绥中坚持土地改革
    游击根据地已趋巩固
    扼住蒋匪关内外军事咽喉
    【新华社东北二十七日电】本社记者顷于热东、辽西两次大捷声中，评述关外北宁路西侧蒋匪军事要地工业中心之锦西、绥中我游击根据地形势称：我冀、察、热、辽解放区热东、辽西分区之绥中、锦西两县，为蒋匪关内外军事要冲，向我热东侵犯的基地，经常驻有敌军一个师至三个师，据点林立，“扫荡”频繁，大小土匪，反动地主武装集团、伙会及花子队等，亦时出骚扰，斗争局面异常残酷。一年来，该区武装与人民结合，坚持游击战争，进行土地改革，发动群众，创造坚固游击根据地，为此次两获大捷铺平了胜利的道路。
    锦西靠近锦州，与葫芦岛是蒋匪军事要地，外围大小据点林立，除敌正规军外，尚有贺景星、侯国斌等大小股匪及花子队以下二十余股，及兴城、朝阳各地之公开或秘密伙会等，不断配合敌人骚扰锦西地区。该区为锦州、凌源、兴城、锦西、朝阳五县之结合地带，对外交通便利，至朝（阳）凌（源）叶（柏寿）均有公路，在敌伪时代，锦西为二等工业区。去年五月中旬，辽西支队攻下新吕门后，干部即发动该区群众，开辟根据地，并连续与敌军土匪花子队等周旋转战，曾于去年十二月及今年一月间两次粉碎敌人的“扫荡”，并且打下了南票据点。今年四月进行大复查与扩军后，部队日益壮大，根据地亦日趋巩固，并扩展至七个区，一九七个行政村，有八十多村进行了土地改革，一万四千亩土地归还了赤贫农民。群众得地后，参军情绪极高，一年来总数达一千四百余人，子弟兵共作战三百五十次，县支队长杨清起不怕艰苦，英勇机智，在锦西地区已打出了威风，小股蒋匪及伙会、花子队等莫不闻风丧胆。
    绥中是热（东）辽（西）分区边沿县之一，抗战时期即有我游击队活动，现在我民主政令可直达渤海边，全县共辖八个行政区，已有一百五十个村进行了土地改革，今年三月进入大复查后，群众得到胜利果实很大，据廿六村统计，即得地五千六百亩，耕畜三百头，复查中有三十五个村组织了拨换工，十一个村成立了合作社，在保卫翻身果实的口号下，群众积极参军，一年来自愿参军而涌入主力者达一千三百余人。
    锦西、绥中两县根据地的创建与成长，其重要原因，是坚持了土地改革，放手发动群众，不断生长新力量，其特点为贯澈“县不离县，区不离区”的思想，土地改革与军事斗争密切结合，认真培养与教育积极分子，形成村支部为核心的斗争堡垒。因而根据地就有了基石，时机一到，就能配合主力大量歼灭敌人，截断蒋匪关内外主要补给线北宁路。
