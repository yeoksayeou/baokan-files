    Jinnan District Party Committee and Administrative Office
    Send Congratulations to the Southern Expedition Soldiers
    [This newspaper's Jinnan dispatch, 18th] Upon hearing the victorious start of the great counter-offensive, the Jinnan District Party Committee and the Jinnan Administrative Office specially send a congratulatory telegram to Generals Liu, Deng, Chen, and Xie, and all the commanders and fighters of the Southern Expedition. The District Party Committee's telegram stated: "Under the wise strategic and tactical principles of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, after severely annihilating the Chiang bandits who invaded our border area, you marched south, captured dozens of cities in succession, and directly attacked the vital pass of Tongguan and the banks of the Yangtze River, liberating vast areas of the Central Plains. Millions of people in the Chiang-controlled areas have been able to escape from the bloody abyss created by the Chiang bandits. While celebrating victory, the people of Jinnan vow to go all out to deepen land reform, step up production and thrift, mobilize the people to actively participate in the war and join the army, and earnestly take care of military families, first helping them with the autumn harvest and wheat planting. The whole people will wholeheartedly support you in striving for the complete victory of the great counter-offensive and overthrowing Chiang Kai-shek's evil rule as soon as possible." The Administrative Office's telegram stated: "We are delighted to hear that our army, with the force of a thunderbolt, crossed the river and advanced into Huai, pressing the Yangtze River in the south and approaching Tongguan in the west, liberating vast areas of eastern Henan, Hubei, Anhui, and western Henan one after another, saving tens of thousands of compatriots from hanging upside down. The autumn harvest in Jinnan is in full swing, wheat planting is prepared, and the preferential treatment for families of soldiers and the substitute plowing are very enthusiastic. The land reform re-examination is gradually unfolding, and cadres heading south are being concentrated. The manpower and materials needed by the front will be continuously supplied. We hope you will focus on killing the enemy and do not worry about the rear, and end Chiang’s rule as soon as possible so that the whole country can be liberated."
