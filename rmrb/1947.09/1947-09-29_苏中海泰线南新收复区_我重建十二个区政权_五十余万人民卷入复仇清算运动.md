Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 27th—Local armed forces from the four counties of Rugao, Taizhou, Taixing, and Jingjiang, south of the Subei Hai'an-Taizhou Highway, advanced towards the Chiang-occupied areas east of the Liangtai and Rugao-Xingang Highways. After removing more than 30 strongholds, they have re-established democratic governments in twelve districts across more than 3,000 square *li* of territory. More than 500,000 people have become involved in the revenge and liquidation movement to achieve liberation. More than 900 village cadres followed the army into their liberated hometowns and universally established peasant associations, militia, and other self-defense organizations with their elders and brothers, revitalizing the rural areas after being looted by Chiang and his puppets. In a certain area of Rugao, more than 1,000 people publicly tried the local tyrants Lu Guosheng and Zhang Mingliang, and confiscated the ill-gotten gains of the pro-Chiang elements with the most heinous crimes and distributed them to the victims. More than forty villages in the Shizhuang District have been involved in re-investigation. In Tai County's Yagu District, a full-scale high tide has been set off after breaking through the model village of Sunzhuang. In a certain township in the Hainan District, 700 *mu* of fertile land were recovered in five days, and more than 100 poor peasants and farm laborers were elected into various leading organizations.

Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 27th—To persist in the anti-"mopping-up" campaign and to welcome the great counter-offensive, farmers in Zhuting (renamed from Ganyu) and other counties in the Binhai District voluntarily requested to expand their armed forces. In Ju County alone, more than 2,000 people joined the district squadrons. The district squadrons in various areas have rapidly and substantially expanded. In the entire Binhai District, the militia has grown to over 70,000. Large numbers of women have also joined the militia. According to statistics from the four counties of Ju County, Rizhao, and Zhuting, more than 10,000 women have participated.
