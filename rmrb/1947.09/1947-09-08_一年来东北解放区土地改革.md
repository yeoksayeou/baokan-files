　　Land Reform in the Northeast Liberated Areas Over the Past Year
　　The Situation of Land Concentration in the Northeast During the Enemy and Puppet Regime

　　Even before the "September 18th Incident," land concentration in the Northeast was higher than in other provinces within the Great Wall. After the Northeast was occupied, the Japanese invaders continued to rule the countryside through the original feudal forces. The ruling institutions of the county, village, and hamlet police, secret agents, Concordia Society, Agricultural Promotion Association, cooperatives, rationing offices, etc., were all controlled by landlords. At that time, in the rural areas of the Northeast, apart from the "Development Lands" and "Manchurian Development Lands" forcibly seized by the Japanese invaders, which accounted for about 10% to 15% of the total cultivated land in the Northeast, and the "private lands" of the Japanese, the remainder was still in the hands of the landlord class. According to statistics, large landlords, who accounted for 3% to 4% of the population, occupied 40% to 50% of the total cultivated land, while poor and landless peasants, who accounted for 60% to 80% of the population, only occupied 20% to 30%. Farmers lived a miserable life of being poorly clothed and fed year after year. After the Chiang Kai-shek troops occupied the Northeast, this situation of land concentration remained unchanged, except for turning the "Manchurian Development Lands" and "Development Lands" into "National (Chiang Kai-shek) Lands." Therefore, in the areas liberated by the Northeast Democratic Allied Army and where democratic regimes were established, the vast number of simple and honest farmers enthusiastically demanded the return of their land and launched a vigorous land reform movement.

　　12,000 Cadres Go to the Countryside

　　In the first year after the "August 15th" liberation of the Northeast—"July 7th" of 1946—the Northeast Central Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party issued a decision to implement land reform, approved the farmers' demand for the return of land, resolutely supported the farmers, mobilized 12,000 cadres, and organized millions of work teams to go deep into the countryside to assist farmers in carrying out the struggle to turn themselves over. Among the cadres, the urban mentality was overcome, and the idea that rural work comes first and the peasant movement comes first was established. In the work of going to the countryside, two lines emerged: one was to live in the homes of landlords and rich peasants, eating well, living well, dressing well, and being well entertained, hearing that everything was good in the village, but the farmers looked askance; the other was to live in the homes of poor peasants, living and talking with them, and enlightening and educating them. But the former line was quickly corrected. The movement began with the large-scale distribution of the "Development Lands" and "Manchurian Development Lands" of the enemy and puppets, and the launching of retaliatory liquidation struggles against traitors and secret agents. Subsequently, the distribution of land from landlords and local tyrants accelerated the movement forward by leaps and bounds, widely igniting the flames of land distribution and opening up the land reform situation in the Northeast Liberated Areas. By the end of 1946, approximately 4.2 million farmers had recovered 3.3 million hectares (1 hectare = 10 mu) of land, and preliminary organizations such as farmers' associations and militias had been established, giving the remnants of the enemy and puppets and feudal landlords an initial blow.

　　"Half-Baked Phenomena in Land Reform"

　　After the land reform movement in the second half of 1946, although the farmers obtained a considerable amount of land, there were few areas where the movement had not been initiated at all, but in most areas the movement was very incomplete, and there was a serious "half-baked rice" phenomenon, which manifested itself in: the prestige of the landlords and local tyrants was not overthrown, and they continued to rule the farmers in various ways and to varying degrees, threatening and attacking the masses and forcing them to return the fruits of their struggle. The masses were not truly mobilized, and they thought that land distribution was "an order from above" and "an allocation from the government." Even in some areas where struggles were ostensibly launched, they only struggled against those far away and not those nearby, against land but not people, against the small but not the big, with open distribution but secret non-distribution, and even after the land was distributed, the masses did not know which plot was which or which room was which, which was practically equivalent to no distribution at all. During the movement, no true activists from the masses emerged, and some landlord lackeys even impersonated activists and usurped the leadership of the movement. The basic reason for the "half-baked" state was that the leadership dared not boldly let go, did not implement the mass line, and made the mistake of coercion, commandism, and taking everything into their own hands. At the end of last year, the Northeast Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party put forward the slogan of eliminating "half-baked rice," mobilized cadres at all levels to overcome the thinking of not daring to boldly let go, boldly questioned their own work, concentrated their efforts in the "half-baked" areas, checked the root causes of the "half-baked" symptoms, went deep into the poor and hired peasants to investigate and visit, made friends with them, improved their level of awareness by means of accounting and the facts of the oppression and exploitation suffered by the peasants, discovered truly poor and young activists from among them, took the lead in uniting the middle peasants, defeated the "turnover" (restoration) activities of the landlords, cleansed the bad cadres, reorganized the farmers' associations and militias, and firmly grasped the leadership in the hands of the poor and hired peasants. After more than a month of hard work, breakthroughs were made in the base areas, experience was gained, and a solid foundation was laid for eliminating "half-baked" areas.

　　"Continuing to Eliminate Half-Baked Rice in Spring Plowing"

　　At the beginning of this year's spring plowing, the Harbin East District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party selected Sheshan Gang in Bin County as a base point to find a way to combine the elimination of half-baked rice with the production movement. The experience gained was that thoroughly solving the land problem by cooking the "half-baked rice" was the key to promoting spring plowing, and only by thoroughly solving the land problem could the production enthusiasm of the masses be improved. Therefore, the new working policy was determined: to intensify the elimination of half-baked rice before spring plowing, to prepare for production in the elimination of half-baked rice, and to continue to cook the half-baked rice after the start of spring plowing without hindering production. The slogan of "Uprooting the Roots of Poverty and Establishing the Roots of Wealth" was put forward to encourage the masses, correct the waste of struggle fruits, and help purchase livestock and farm implements. In addition, production mutual aid education was carried out in the peasants' united struggle to overcome the difficulties of turned-over peasants lacking livestock. Due to this combination with the production struggle, not only was the slogan of "Not Leaving New Wasteland Unplanted" realized, but also wasteland was opened up and the cultivated area was expanded. By mid-June, the areas where half-baked rice had been cooked reached 30% to 50%. In these areas, the land problem had been basically solved, the remnants of the enemy and puppets and feudal forces had been further destroyed, and the superiority of the basic masses had been established. As for the areas where half-baked rice had not been cooked, due to the influence of the cooked areas, the removal of bad cadres, the determination of land rights in spring plowing, etc., great changes had also taken place compared to the past: the distributed land, houses, livestock, and grain had indeed reached the hands of the peasants, the phenomenon of open distribution but secret non-distribution basically no longer existed, there were not many bad cadres in power, the thinking of changing the world had been eliminated, and the peasants did not believe the landlords' rumors. However, there were still problems such as landlords leaving good land, leaving more land, and not moving floating wealth and hidden wealth. The feudal forces had not been completely defeated, and the cadres still had the idea of being two-faced.

　　Deepen the Struggle to Dig Up Treasures

　　In the land reform of the past year, general areas took too much care of the landlord class, and the land, livestock, and houses left were both more and better than those of the masses. The poor were only "sleeping on their sides" (half turned over). Therefore, during the "hoeing and tilling" period, there was a widespread shortage of grain, and the problem of "not being able to eat enough and not being able to hoe the land well" arose. However, the landlords had a lot of grain hidden in their homes, preferring to let it rot rather than give it to the masses to eat. The masses then put forward the slogan of deepening the struggle to dig up treasures and completely destroying the feudal forces. This treasure-digging movement began in Hailun County, Heilongjiang Province, in June this year, and spread to all parts of northern Manchuria in less than a month. This movement was larger in scale, more powerful, more fruitful, and more devastating to the landlords than any previous struggle. According to incomplete statistics from Wuchang, Zhuhe, and other six counties in Songjiang Province in mid-July, floating wealth worth a total of 20 billion yuan was unearthed, including more than 105 jin of gold. After the masses recovered this blood debt, they completely solved the difficulties of eating grain and livestock in production, settled down their families, and generally achieved two hoeings and two tillings, and up to four hoeings and four tillings. The economic foundation of the landlords was finally defeated. This movement is now being carried out in depth everywhere. At present, the land reform in the Northeast Liberated Areas has put forward the following goals: except for newly recovered areas, the entire region is required to completely eliminate half-baked rice and thoroughly solve the land problem by the end of this year.

　　Major Gains of Land Reform in the Northeast Over the Past Year

　　After a year of vigorous land reform movement in the Northeast Liberated Areas, the rule of the feudal forces has been basically destroyed. The poor peasants who have been groaning under the feudal tyranny of the landlord class for thousands of years have been liberated politically and economically and have become the masters of their own land again. As of statistics in July this year, there were 6,290,824 landless and land-poor peasants in the Northeast Liberated Areas (including the eight provinces of Jilin, Heilongjiang, Nenjiang, Liaobei, Songjiang, Mudanjiang, Hejiang, and Liaoning, and Rehe Province). They obtained 5,031,908 hectares (1 hectare = 10 mu) of land, averaging 8 mu of land per person. According to incomplete statistics from the five regions of Liaobei, Songjiang, Hejiang, Jilin, and Mudanjiang, the peasants recovered 59,152 head of livestock, 1,046,286 shi of grain (1 shi = 500 jin), and 156,151 rooms from the landlords and local tyrants; the value of the floating wealth (gold, silver, clothing, miscellaneous items) recovered was several times greater than the total value of the land recovered, and the number of people who benefited accounted for more than one-half to two-thirds of the total number of peasants. After the peasants turned over, their production enthusiasm doubled. About 70% to 80% of the peasants in the region generally participated in mutual aid groups, and production efficiency increased by one-fifth compared with previous years. The entire region completed plowing 10 days earlier than in previous years, sowing a total of 13,114,000 hectares of cultivated land, expanding the cultivated area by more than 10%, or more than 1.4 million hectares, compared with last year. The area of wheat land accounted for one-quarter of the total cultivated land, an increase of 10% over previous years. The political gains are even greater than the economic gains. The peasants' awareness has been raised, and their fighting enthusiasm for defending their victorious fruits and defeating the Chiang Kai-shek bandit's offensive is rising day by day. Hundreds of thousands of turned-over peasants are flocking to the main force of the Democratic Allied Army and local armed forces in batches. In the tense land reform and production movement, they actively support the front line. Over the past year, more than 390,000 people have participated in the war, forming 43,000 stretchers and 86,000 carts. During this year's summer offensive by the Democratic Allied Army, some of the masses who participated in the war traveled thousands of miles with the army and fought for three months, and their enthusiasm remained high. The turned-over peasants in the Northeast are now consciously fighting for their own interests, which is a guarantee of the inevitable victory of the Democratic Allied Army.

### 一年来东北解放区土地改革

　　一年来东北解放区土地改革
  　敌伪统治时期东北土地集中的情况
    “九一八”以前东北土地即较关内各省集中，东北沦亡后，日寇经过原有的封建势力继续统治农村，县、村、屯的警察、特务、协和会、兴农会、合作社、配给所等统治机构，都由地主掌握。当时东北农村土地除了经日寇强占的约为东北总耕地百分之十到十五的“开拓地”、“满拓地”及日本人的“私有地”外，余则仍操在地主阶级的手里。据统计占人口百分之三到四的大地主，即占有全耕地百分之四十到五十，而占人口百分之六十至八十的无地少地的贫雇农，则仅占百分之二十到三十。农民终年过着衣不蔽体、食不果腹的悲惨生活。此种土地集中的情况，在蒋军侵占后，除将“满拓地”、“开拓地”变成“国（蒋介石）有地”外，并无丝毫的改变。因此，经东北民主联军解放而建立了民主政权的地区，广大淳朴农民即热烈要求收回自己的土地，展开了轰轰烈烈的土地改革运动。
    一万二千个干部下乡
    “八一五”东北光复后的第一年——一九四六年“七七”，中共东北中央局发布了实行土地改革决定，批准了农民收回土地的要求，坚决为农民撑腰，动员一万二千个干部，组织数百万个工作团，深入农村，协助农民进行翻身斗争。在干部中克服了城市观念，确立农村工作第一，农民运动第一的思想。在下乡工作中，并产生了两条路线：一是住在地主、富农家里，吃好、住好、穿好、招待好，听到的是村里一切都好，但农民却侧目而视；一是住在贫农群众家里，和他共同生活、谈心，启发教育。但前一条路线很快被纠正了。运动开始是大量分配敌伪的“开拓地”和“满拓地”，对汉奸特务进行复仇清算斗争，继之即分配地主恶霸土地，运动便大踏步的向前发展，广泛烧起了分土地的烈火，轰开了东北解放区土地改革的局面。到了一九四六年底，约有四百二十万农民，收回了三百三十万垧（每垧十亩）的土地，初步建立了农会、民兵等组织，给敌伪残余及封建地主以首次打击。
    “土地改革中的夹生现象”
    经过了一九四六年下半年的土地改革运动，农民们虽然获得了数量不少的土地，完全没有开辟运动的白地是不多了，但大多数地区运动很不彻底，严重存在着“夹生饭”的现象，表现在：地主恶霸的威风没有打倒，他们仍用各种方法在各种程度上继续统治着农民，并威胁打击群众退还果实。群众没有真正发动起来，对于分土地以为是“上面的命令，”“官家的配给，”即使有些地区表面上也掀起了斗争，但都是斗远不斗近，斗地不斗人，斗小不斗大，明分暗不分，甚至分了地以后群众还不知道地是那一块，房是那一间，实际上等于没有分。在运动中，没有产生群众真正的积极分子，甚至有些地主狗腿冒充积极分子，篡夺了运动的领导权。“造成夹生”状态的基本原因，在于领导上不敢大胆放手，没有贯彻群众路线，犯了强迫命令，包办代替的毛病。在去年年底中共东北局就提出了消灭夹生饭的口号，动员各级干部，打通不敢大胆放手的思想，大胆怀疑自己的工作，集中力量在夹生地区，检查夹生症结所在，深入贫雇农中去调查访问，和他们做朋友，以算帐方法，及农民身受的压迫剥削事实，提高他们觉悟程度，从中发现真正贫苦的青年积极分子，带头团结中农，打败地主的“翻身”（复辟）活动，洗刷坏干部，重组农会、民兵，把领导权牢固地掌握在贫雇农手里。这样经过一个多月的艰苦工作，突破基点取得经验，给消灭“夹生”地区造成了稳固的基础。
    “在春耕中继续消灭夹生饭”
    今年春耕开始，中共哈东地委选择宾县射神岗作为基点，寻求消灭夹生饭与生产运动结合的方法，得出经验是煮熟“夹生饭”彻底解决土地问题，是推动春耕的关键，只有彻底解决土地问题，才能提高群众的生产情绪。因此确定新的工作方针是：在春耕前加紧消灭夹生饭，在消灭夹生饭中去准备生产，春耕开始后在不妨害生产条件下继续煮熟夹生饭。提出了“拔掉穷根安富根”口号鼓励群众，纠正浪费斗争果实，帮助购置牲口农具等，此外在农民团结斗争中，进行生产互助教育，克服翻身农民缺乏畜力等的困难，由于这样与生产斗争的结合，不但实现了“不扔新荒全部种上”的口号，而且开了荒扩大了耕地面积，煮过生饭的地区到六月中为止，则已达百分之三十到五十，这种地区土地问题已基本解决，敌伪残余封建势力已进一步摧毁，基本群众的优势已经确定。至于未煮夹生饭的地区，由于煮熟地区的影响，坏干部的撤换，春耕中地权的确定等，也与过去发生很大的变化：分配的土地、房屋、牲口、粮食确实到了农民手里，明分暗不分的现象基本上不存在，坏干部当权的不多了，变天思想消除了，地主造谣农民都不相信了。但是还存在着地主留好地，多留地，浮财底财未动等问题，封建势力并未彻底打垮，干部还存在两面光的思想。
    深入斗争挖财宝
    过去一年土地改革中，一般地区对地主阶级照顾太多，留的土地、牲口、房屋都较群众又多又好，穷人只是“侧睡”（翻半个身）着，因此在“铲趟”期间普遍遇到粮食困难，“吃不饱肚、铲不好地”的问题。而地主家里却藏着很多粮食，宁可沤烂，也不肯给群众吃。群众于是提出深入斗争挖财宝，彻底摧毁封建势力的口号。这一挖财宝运动今年六月开始于黑龙江海伦县，不及一月即普遍于北满各地。这一运动规模之大，威力之猛，收获之多，给地主打击之重，均超过以往的斗争。据松江省五常、珠河等六县七月中旬不完全统计，起出浮物共值二百亿元，其中金子一项即达一百零五斤之多。群众追回这笔血债之后，完全解决了生产中的吃粮、牲畜等困难，按下了家底，普遍做到两铲两趟，多至四铲四趟，地主的经济基础则最后被打垮。现在这一运动正在各地深入开展。目前东北解放区土地改革已提出了这样的目标：除新收复区，全区要求在今年年底以前全部消灭夹生饭，彻底解决土地问题。
    一年来东北土地改革的主要收获
    东北解放区经过了一年轰轰烈烈的土地改革运动，基本上摧毁了封建势力的统治，几千年来呻吟在地主阶级封建淫威下面的贫苦农民，在政治上经济上获得翻身，重新成为自己土地的主人。截至今年七月统计，东北解放区（包括吉林、黑龙江、嫩江、辽北、松江、牡丹江、合江、辽宁等八省及热河一省）已有六百廿九万零八百二十四个无地少地的贫苦农民。获得土地五百零三万一千九百零八垧（每垧十亩），平均每人得地八亩。另据辽北、松江、合江、吉林、牡丹江五个地区不完全统计，农民从地主恶霸手里收回牲口五万九千一百五十二头，粮食一百零四万六千二百八十六石（每石五百斤），房屋十五万六千一百五十一间；收回浮财（金、银、衣服、杂物）比收回土地的全部价值还大数倍，获得果实的人数，占全体农民二分之一至三分之二以上。农民翻身后生产情绪倍增，全区约有百分之七十至八十的农民普遍参加了互助组，生产效率较往年提高五分之一；全区耕田较往年提早十天种完，共计播种耕地一千三百十一万四千余垧，比去年扩大耕地面积百分之十以上一百四十余万垧，麦地面积占总耕地四分之一，较往年增加百分之十。在政治上的收获比经济上更大，农民觉悟提高了，对保卫自己的胜利果实，击败蒋贼进攻的战斗热情正日益高涨，数十万翻身农民成批涌入民主联军主力及地方武装，在紧张的土地改革及生产动运中，积极支援前线，一年来参战群众已达三十九万余人，组成担架四万三千付，大车八万六千辆。在民主联军今年夏季攻势中，有些参战群众随军跋涉数千里，转战三个月，情绪始终高涨。东北翻身农民现在是自觉的为自己的利益而战，这就成为民主联军必胜的保证。
