　　Good Husbands and Sons March to Kill Chiang Kai-shek Bandits
  　Great Victory Excites Every Family
  　Taiyue Military Dependents Write Letters to the Front to Congratulate the Victory
    [This newspaper, Taiyue, 16th dispatch] The victory news of Chen Geng's southern expeditionary army spread, boosting the morale of the entire army. The military dependents of the expeditionary army wrote letters to their husbands and grandsons to congratulate them. The Taiyue Xinhua Daily received more than twenty letters from military dependents in one day, requesting them to be forwarded to their husbands fighting on the front lines. Xiao Pu, from Shuiguo Village, Yangcheng, who had personally seen her husband off, wrote in a letter to her husband: "Since we parted in Nuan Yan Village, the villagers and I have been looking forward to your victory news every day. Sure enough, the victory news has arrived, and you can imagine how happy I am. You have shed blood and sweat and made great contributions to the people of Henan. This is glorious, and even I am glorious. Your Bao Shan baby and I are both doing well. Please write back in detail about your victory news..." Guo Xiaohe, a military dependent from Liqiu, after receiving the victory news, hurriedly asked someone to write a letter to his grandson, Yi Xue, saying: "This time you crossed the Yellow River and quickly recovered five cities. The whole family is happy. Now our autumn seedlings have been weeded by the mutual aid group, and the village cadres are planning to take care of plowing the land for us so that we can plant more wheat. There are no difficulties at home. Your younger siblings are all studying and making rapid progress, so I hope you don't worry. The whole family's hope for you is when you will defeat Chiang Kai-shek and when you will come home..." Zhao Lanying, a woman who loves her husband, also asked someone to write a letter to her man, telling him that there were no difficulties at home, that the enthusiasm for production was very high, that she had woven five or six lengths of cloth, which could be exchanged for some grain and cotton clothing, and that the villagers had also taken care of weeding the land, congratulating her husband on winning more battles and making more contributions to the people at the front.
    [This newspaper, Jinan, 16th dispatch] Yuan Dynasty village cadres take the lead in solving the problem of fertilizer for military dependents to plant wheat. The Huazhuang Village in the Third District organized twenty-six mutual aid groups, which have made great achievements in weeding seedlings and other production in the past. In the recent fertilizer accumulation campaign to prepare for wheat planting, they have shown special concern for solving the fertilizer difficulties of military dependents. Communist Party member Zhang Hongxu led the entire team to build three toilets for military dependents in one night and collected manure for military dependents in turns. In twenty days, he made fertilizer for military dependents eighteen times. Zhang Qihuai stepped on manure for military dependents fifteen times in twenty days, and Zhang Zhenyuan stepped on it five times. Hu Qingzhu, Hu Jiugan, and other groups made fertilizer for military dependents several times. In total, the entire village made sixty cartloads of fertilizer for military dependents in twenty days. The From-Good-to-Excellent Women's Mutual Aid Group cooperated with male and female students to make fertilizer for military dependents once every three days. The group leaders, Feng Renzhi and Fu Jinfang, guarded the well to draw water. Elementary school students also rushed to participate after school, all willing to strive to be exemplary in supporting the military in solving the fertilizer difficulties of military dependents. Shang Xiuxiang, the head of the sisters' regiment in Tianliu Village, Third District, took the lead in jumping into the manure pit of military dependents to step on manure. Zhang Guilian carried water thirty-five buckets twice. Male and female elementary school students were not to be outdone and stepped on twenty-four pits of manure for military dependents at once.
