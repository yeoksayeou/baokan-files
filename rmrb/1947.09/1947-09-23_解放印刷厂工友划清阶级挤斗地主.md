    Liberation Printing Factory Workers
    Draw Clear Class Lines and Squeeze Out Landlords
    [Our News] The Changzhi Liberation Printing Factory is conducting a squeeze-out of feudalism. At the beginning of the squeeze-out of feudalism, they encountered such antagonistic sentiments as: fear of losses to the factory, frequently working and living together, and embarrassment. Niu Sanbao grazed sheep and did odd jobs from childhood, living in the factory. Wang Qiyuan is his nephew and a landlord who still looks down on him. Starting from this hatred of one person, they guided everyone to recognize that it was a matter of the landlord class against the workers and peasants, and thus everyone changed. The trade union first rectified its organization, with individuals discussing their family history, and everyone determined class composition. The membership cards, worker ID cards, and armbands of the landlord members were taken back, and their expulsion from membership was announced. Then they launched a bitter complaint and exposed the crimes of the landlords' sabotage: Niu Sanbao said: "I couldn't eat enough or dress warmly from childhood, grazing sheep and doing odd jobs as a worker. Only when the Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army came, did I marry and turn myself around." Han Chougou said: "The landlords exploited and ruled, starving my child to death in a year of famine!" At this time, the workers' emotions were mobilized, and the leadership supported the workers, calling on them to consciously rise up, defend their factory, and eliminate the landlord class. Landlord Li Lizi (a special agent), Wang Qiyuan, Wang Youwang whose family had been struggled against, Tian Migou, Wang Sangen, etc., were squeezed out to carry out struggle. Landlord and special agent Li Lizi committed extremely serious crimes, making statements about the change of dynasties, conducting investigation work, the masses did not answer him when he addressed them as "Mr.", he wrote in the newspaper that a hundred brigades of Chiang's army had been wiped out, but wrote it as two hundred, and refused to typeset or publish manuscripts from the staff newspaper criticizing feudalism, etc., which the masses hated to the bone. Li Lizi was executed on the spot by the masses. Wang Qiyuan was sent back to the village to be dealt with by the masses. After the remaining three, who had been "cut off their tails" by the masses, were given suggestions by the workers, they confessed on the spot, and finally were treated by separating from their families in thought and action. Some workers who were very backward in the past have completely transformed after distinguishing classes in this movement. After squeezing out feudalism, the whole factory took on a completely new look. The typesetting room did three days' work in two days, and everyone's morale was particularly high. (Workers' Life)

    解放印刷厂工友
    划清阶级挤斗地主
    【本报讯】长治解放印刷厂进行挤封建。挤封建开头就遇到：怕工厂受损失，经常在一块工作生活，不好意思等对抗情绪。牛三保从小放羊打短工，住工厂，王启元是他外甥，是个地主，现在还看不起他，从这仇恨一个人，诱导大家认识了是地主阶级对工农的问题，这样大家转变了。工会先整顿组织，由个人谈家庭历史情况，大家决定阶级成份。把地主会员职工证纠察队背章收回，宣布开除会籍。接着诉苦揭露地主破坏罪恶：牛三保说：“从小吃不饱，穿不暖，放羊打短工当工人。只有共产党八路军来了，才结婚翻了身。”韩臭狗说：“地主剥削统治，灾荒年饿死我小孩！”这时工人情绪发动了，领导上给工人撑了腰，号召工人自觉起来，保卫自己工厂，肃清地主阶级。地主李力子（特务）王启元，家被斗争过的王有旺，田迷狗、王三根等被挤出来开展斗争，地主兼特务李力子罪恶极大，造变天之言，作调查工作，群众不叫他先生不答话，写报消灭蒋军一百个旅，写成二百个，职工报挤封建稿不排、不登等，群众恨之入骨，李力子当场被群众处决。王启元送回村交群众处理。下余这三个被群众割过尾巴的，工人给他们提了意见后，当场坦白，最后处理和家庭思想行动分家。有些工人过去很落后，这次在运动中分清了阶级，完全转变了。挤封建后全厂面目焕然一新。排字房两天作了三天的工作，大家的情绪特别高。  （职工生活）
