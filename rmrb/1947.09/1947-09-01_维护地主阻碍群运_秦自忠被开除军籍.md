　　Maintaining Landlords and Obstructing Mass Movements
　　Qin Zizhong Expelled from Military Service
　　[Our Newspaper's Report] Qin Zizhong, the squad leader of the Third Squad of the First Company of the Linzhang Brigade, a native of Dahuo Village in Cheng'an, had served as a puppet soldier. He joined the army in 1942 and made little progress. In February of this year, he returned home due to illness. He frequently ate and drank with bad elements at home. When the masses struggled against his family's landlord, Qin Wen, he used his mother to disrupt the meeting, causing the masses' morale to decline. At the same time, he demanded excessive gains from the struggle and deliberately quarreled with village cadres, attempting to defeat the active elements in the village and suppress the masses. Therefore, he was legally expelled from military service and handed over to the government for handling.
　　Xiao Erpang, the director of the Women's Association of Yan Village in the Third District of Hengshui, was dismissed by the masses for shielding landlords. After Erpang was elected as the director of the Women's Association, her work appeared active on the surface, but when struggling against the landlord Si Hong's family, she helped Si Hong's wife secretly transport and disperse items. She secretly informed Si Hong's family about the secret meetings of the village women's association and hid materials for Si Hong's family. Despite repeated education and criticism from village cadres, Erpang remained unrepentant. The masses therefore dismissed her and investigated the materials hidden for the landlord.
