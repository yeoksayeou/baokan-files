Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 27th. The rapid decline of the Chiang currency continues to accelerate. According to a Reuters dispatch from Shanghai on the 25th, the black market price of US dollars in Shanghai surged again on the 25th from around 55,000 yuan since the 22nd to 58,000 yuan. Amidst the soaring black market for US dollars, the Chiang family's Central Bank Stabilization Fund Committee raised the benchmark exchange rate for US dollars by 3,500 yuan to 46,000 yuan to one US dollar on the 26th. However, the black market price of US dollars subsequently rose even higher, reaching a peak of 60,000 yuan, more than 30 percent higher than the Central Bank's "open" market exchange rate. This decline in the Chiang currency not only affects the prices of imported goods, which are most sensitive to the currency market, but also causes huge losses to export merchants due to the large difference between the black market price and the "open" exchange rate. Since the Chiang government revised its foreign exchange measures on August 17, the entire effort has failed within a month. During this period, the black market price of US dollars has risen by 50 percent, and the Central Bank's "open" market has also risen by nearly 20 percent, while prices have risen by 50 to 100 percent.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 28th. According to a Central News Agency dispatch from Chongqing on the 27th, prices in Chongqing have been rising sharply in the past month, especially since the 21st of this month. White rice rose from 235,000 yuan per dan on the 20th, an increase of 16 percent, to 272,000 yuan per dan. 20-count yarn rose from 14.2 million yuan per piece to 17.6 million yuan. Among export goods, tung oil rose by 24 percent, reaching 720,000 yuan per dan; white silk also rose from 30 million yuan per dan to 41 million yuan, an increase of 37 percent.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 27th. The deficit in foreign trade in the Chiang-controlled areas increased sharply in July. According to a United Press dispatch from Shanghai on the 25th, the Chiang regime's customs has just released statistics showing that imports in the Chiang-controlled areas reached an unprecedented high in July, totaling 721 billion yuan, equivalent to US$60.083 million (calculated at the then official exchange rate of 12,000 yuan per US dollar). Exports declined to 236.9 billion yuan, equivalent to US$19.75 million. Exports were less than one-third of the value of imports, with a total deficit of 481.1 billion yuan, a loss of more than US$40 million in foreign exchange, doubling the deficit of 266.5 billion yuan in June. The largest increase in imports in July was cotton, cotton yarn, and cotton thread, valued at 199 billion yuan. The total value of imports increased by 36 percent compared to June. Among export goods, oils, tea, wax, and other items decreased sharply. The value of tea alone fell from 10 billion yuan in June to 2 billion yuan in July. The total value of exports decreased by more than 13 percent compared to June. According to the customs report, the sharp increase in imports is still due to the massive dumping of American goods. The total value of American goods imported through the port of Shanghai in July alone reached 298.329955 million yuan, overwhelmingly ranking first among imports from all countries.

    蒋币惨跌如马脱缰
    美汇扶摇直上六万元
    蒋管区七月份入超五千亿
    【新华社陕北二十七日电】蒋币狂跌风潮继续急骤发展。据路透社上海二十五日电报导，二十五日上海美钞黑市价格又由二十二日以来的五万五千元左右猛涨至五万八千元。美钞黑市暴涨声中，蒋家中央银行平衡基金委员会于二十六日又将美汇基准价提高三千五百元定为四万六千元蒋币兑一美元，但美钞黑市价格随之更扶摇直上而达六万元高峰。高出中央银行“公开”市场汇价百分之三十以上。此一蒋币跌风不仅影响对货币市场反应最的入口货价格直趋上涨，同时出口商人也因黑市价格与“公开”汇率差额过大而蒙受巨大损失。按自八月十七日蒋政府修改外汇办法以来，为时月余全部破，在此期间美钞黑市上涨百分之五十，中央银行“公开”市场也上涨几达百分之二十，同时物价已上涨百分之五十到百分之百。
    【新华社陕北二十八日电】据中央社重庆二十七日电：近一月来重庆物价直线上升，本月二十一日以来尤甚。白米由二十日每市担二十三万五千元，上涨百分之十六而达每担二十七万二千元。二十支纱每件由一千四百二十万元升至一千七百六十万元。出口货中，桐油上升百分之二十四，每担达七十二万元；白丝也由三千万一担升至四千一百万元，涨百分之三十七。
    【新华社陕北二十七日电】蒋管区七月份对外贸易入超急剧增高。据合众社上海二十五日电报导：蒋记海关顷发表统计，蒋区七月份进口货物空前高度，共值蒋币七千二百一十亿元，合美金六千零八万三千元（以当时官价美汇率一万二千元计算），出口货则衰退至蒋币二千三百六十九亿元，折合美金一千九百七十五万元，出口不及入口货值的三分之一，入超共达货币四千八百十一亿元，损失外汇达四千余万美金。较之六月份入超蒋币二千六百五十亿元又增高一倍。七月份进口货增加最多者为棉、棉纱及棉线，其值一千九百九十亿元，进口总值较六月份增高百分之三十六，出口货中则以油类、茶叶、蜡等锐减，其中茶叶一项自六月份之一百亿降为七月份之二十亿元，出口总值较六月份减少百分之十三强。入口骤增原因，据该海关报告透露，仍由于美货的大量倾销，仅上海口岸七月份美货进口总值即达二千九百八十三亿二千九百九十五万五千元，为进口各国货的压倒第一位。
