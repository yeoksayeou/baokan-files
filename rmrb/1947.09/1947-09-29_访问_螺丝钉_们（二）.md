    How to Fatten the Pigs

    I came out of Minister Zhang's house and hadn't walked far when I met a man in his forties leading a group of pigs. The pigs were so obedient, following him all the time. When I asked his name, I realized he was Qin Xiaoshan, the old comrade who ensured that every comrade in the Political Department could eat two catties of pork a month.

    He is from Gantou Village, Lincheng, with an apron tied around his waist, the apron speckled with food stains. He has the pure, honest, and utterly loyal face of a farmer.

    I followed him to the pigsty and squatted beside it, talking about raising pigs. He said that because the place was narrow and there were few troughs, he had arranged two places for the pigs: one for sleeping and one for eating. When feeding, they were divided into two shifts, one in the early morning and one in the evening.

    "You think pigs are very dirty, right? You still have to teach them hygiene!" Old Qin said interestingly: "If you teach the pigs good hygiene, they will gain weight. In winter, people are afraid of the cold, and pigs are also afraid of the cold. Don't feed them when they are shivering from the cold. Feed them when the sun has been shining for half the day and it's warm. Feed them again in the afternoon, halfway through the afternoon. In summer, people are afraid of the heat, and pigs are also afraid of the heat. The first meal should be fed before breakfast when it's cool. If you feed them late, they'll be too busy panting."

    "February and March are good for feeding pigs." Old Qin continued, "At other times, you have to worry all the time. Feeding pigs is like raising children. They can't talk, so everything depends on people to manage." In summer, pigsties should be washed more often. This year, there is a drought, and there is no river in this village, so I splash water on them. Water must also be splashed in the pigsty, otherwise it will be too dry, and the dust will choke their stomachs when the pigs breathe, making them prone to illness."

    "How many years have you been raising pigs?"

    "I started raising them in 1941, six or seven years now."

    "Are you satisfied with this job?"

    "I'm just afraid of not doing this job well." Old Qin said seriously, "You think, so many people in our organization rely on these pigs to improve their lives. The leaders have entrusted this burden to us, and we can't shirk it. Since we've taken it on, we have to be worthy of the public. In the first half of this year, we slaughtered more than forty large pigs, averaging over a hundred catties each. We'll have to do that much again in the second half of the year. My burden is not light!" He showed a proud and happy expression on his face.

    When asked about his family matters, he was very indifferent, but he was still concerned about his son who had been lost since 1943, like losing his mother. He said, "I only have one thought now, to settle the child down. I'm old now and don't want to find a partner. I'll be satisfied as long as the child grows up. But Commander Liu said, don't go home this year, do a good job and defeat Chiang Kai-shek. I listened and said, that's very good, that's how it should be done! We'll postpone our affairs and do revolutionary work first."

          A Silent Worker

    Comrade Niu Shouchéng is a silent worker! I went to look for him several times, but I couldn't find him. But everyone knows his deeds. Comrade Meiling told me that when the cadres were being evaluated for merit, he received 100% of the votes for a first-class merit.

    "The century of the people gives merit to the people, which is the supreme glory." This is the inscription Liu Bocheng gave to the "Merit Book". Comrade Niu Shouchéng has made first-class contributions to the people in his "lower-level" work.

    Comrade Niu is in charge of distribution, and has always been faithful to his duties. In the organization's merit campaign, this advantage has become even more brilliant. He said: "Distribution work is a part of political work, and it is an indispensable bridge from the masses to the masses." He doesn't see it as a purely technical, self-inflicted annoyance. Instead, he does this work with a cheerful mood. He said that every document has its own value, and there are many valuable experiences in it. The leaders have spent a lot of effort writing them, and a lot of money printing them. If those who do the distribution work can't distribute them well and in a timely manner, it's the same as not using them, and the promotion and improvement of the entire work will be affected. Because of this, he doesn't simply issue the documents and consider it done. Instead, he gives it careful consideration and planning. Whenever a document is delivered to him, he always looks at its content, nature, and quantity, and how to distribute it appropriately. This can avoid waste and ensure that each document plays its due role.

    "Being tired of one's job," and "the grass is always greener on the other side," is a common problem, right? But everyone who mentions Niu Shouchéng's seriousness, love, and dedication to his work is full of admiration. When sending large batches of documents to the post office, he was afraid of damaging them, so he did not hesitate to use his own bedding to wrap them well. After doing this many times, his quilt was cut with many holes by the rope, but he said that it didn't matter if the quilt was broken, but if a word or a sentence was worn off the document, it would cause big trouble.

    This year, the workload has become even heavier, more than double that of last year. After dinner, many comrades were walking in the streets or outside the village, but he was still working silently at home. In the hot summer weather, he was bundling books, dripping with sweat. The rope rubbed many blood blisters on his hands, but he didn't say a word of complaint. According to statistics, from March to July of this year alone, a total of more than 108,000 books were issued, bundled into eight or nine hundred bundles. Other newspapers and magazines such as "Military and Political Correspondence", "Comrade-in-Arms News", picture albums and "People's Warrior", totaling 58,000 copies, and 50,000 leaflets were distributed. When our Liu-Deng army victoriously crossed the river, he was busy sending the books to the front, and he was very anxious. From waking up in the morning, he kept bundling until late at night. After working so hard for a week, the heavy and urgent task was finally completed victoriously.

    访问“螺丝钉”们（二）

    怎样把猪喂肥
    我从张部长家里出来，走了没有多远，碰见一个四十多岁的人，领着一群猪过来了。猪，那么听话，跟着他一直在跑。一问他的名字，我才知道他就是保证政治部每个同志每月能吃二斤猪肉的功臣——秦小山老同志。
    他是临城岗头村人，腰里扎有围裙，围裙上饭点斑斑。醇朴，老实，忠诚十足的农民面孔。
    我跟着他一起到喂猪的地方，蹲在猪圈旁边，谈起喂猪的事情。他说因为地方窄狭，猪槽子少，给猪弄了两个去处，一个叫猪睡觉，一个叫猪吃饭。喂的时候分两班，一班每天早喂，一班晚喂。
    “你看猪很肮脏吧？还得给猪讲卫生呢！”老秦有趣的说：“给猪讲好卫生，猪才能长胖。冬天，人怕冷，猪也怕冷，冻得它浑身打抖擞的时候不要喂，老阳晒到半天晌，暖和了才喂。下午也在半后晌来喂。夏天，人怕热，猪也怕热，头一顿饭要在早饭前趁凉爽来喂。喂得晚了，热得它光顾得喘气了。”
    “二八月好喂猪。”老秦继续说道：“别的时候，要时时刻刻操心。喂猪也象养小孩，它不会说话，全凭人来经管。”夏天，要叫猪圈多洗澡。今年天旱，这村没有河，我就给它往身上泼水。猪圈里也得泼水，要不，太干燥了，猪一呼吸，尘土就会呛到它的肚里，容易生病。”
    “你喂了几年猪了？”
    “四一年就喂起，六七年了。”
    “你满意这工作吗？”
    “我光怕这工作做不好。”老秦严肃的说：“你想，咱机关这么多人，全凭这些猪改善生活哩。首长把这担子交给咱，咱也不能不担。咱既然担上啦，就得对起公家。今年半年杀了四十多个大猪，平均每个都杀一百来斤。后半年还得这么多。我的担子不轻啊！”他脸上表现出骄矜而愉快的颜色。
    问起他的家常事来，他很淡漠，不过对于他四三年象死了母亲的因而流落在外的儿子还牵着他的心肝他说：“我如今只有一条心，把小孩安插好，咱老了，也不想找个对象啦，只要孩子长大，啥都满意了。可是刘司令员说，今年不要回家，好好搞工作，打垮蒋介石。我听了，我说很好，该这样办！咱的事情往后推推，先做革命工作。”
          默默的工作者
    牛守诚同志，是个默默的工作者吧！我去找他几次，没有找见。但他的事迹，人人知道，梅岭同志告我说，干部评功的时候，百分之百的投票给他立一大功。
    “人民的世纪为人民立功，就是无上的光荣。”这是刘伯承将军给“功劳簿”上的题词，牛守诚同志就在他的“下层”工作上，给人民立了头等功勋。
    牛同志是做发行工作的，一向忠实于自己的职务。在机关立功运动中，这个优点更加光辉灿烂了。他说：“发行工作是政治工作的一部分，是从群众中来、到群众去不可缺少的桥梁。”他不把它看成单纯的技术，自找苦恼。而是用愉快的心情去做这工作。他说每一样文件都有它一定价值，里面有很多宝贵经验，首长们费了很大心血编写出来，又用很多的钱印出来，假如做发行工作的不能很好的及时的把它发下去，就等于没有用，整个工作的推进与提高，就要受到影响。正因如此，所以他对自己的工作不是单纯的发下就算了事，而是经过很周详的考虑和计划，每逢文件发到他手里，他总要看看它是什么内容性质，数量多少，如何分发才适当。这样就可以避危浪费，使每一个文件都起了它应起的作用。
    “在行厌行”，“这山看见自那山”，这是个通病吧？但牛守诚同志对于工作的认真、热爱、钻研，谁提起来，都是敬佩不止的。大批文件送给邮局时，他怕把文件磨坏了，不惜用自己的褥单，夹被也要把文件包好。次数多了，他的被子被绳子勒了好多窟窿，但他说被子破了没有什么，文件磨掉一个字，一句话！就会出大乱子。
    今年，工作更加繁重了，比起去年增加到两倍以上。晚饭后，许多同志在街上或村外散步，他一个人仍在家里不吭气的工作着。夏天天气酷热，他满头滴着汗在捆扎着书包。绳子把手上磨了好些血泡，他没有说一句怨言。据统计，仅从今年三月到七月，共发出书籍十万八千多册捆了八、九百捆。其他如“军政往来”，“战友报”及画报，“人民战士”等报纸杂志，共发出五万八千份，传单五万份。在我刘邓大军胜利渡河的时候，他忙于把前方的书籍发出去，心里很着急，从早上起床，一直捆到深更半夜，这样忙了一个礼拜，繁重而紧急的任务，终于胜利的完成了。
