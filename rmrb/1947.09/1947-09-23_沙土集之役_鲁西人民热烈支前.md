    Battle of Shatushiji
    People of Western Shandong Enthusiastically Support the Front
    [Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 21st] The people of Western Shandong enthusiastically supported the East China Field Army in annihilating the enemy at Shatushiji. When a certain company of the People's Liberation Army entered a village on the outskirts of Shatushiji to fight, the grain in the village had already been looted by the Chiang bandits, but the village cadre said: "It doesn't matter, our village still has wheat hidden. We have five stone mills, each grinding fifty catties, five fives are two hundred and fifty, enough for the comrades to eat!" After saying that, he ran outside the village to notify the masses to go home and take out the buried wheat. A large amount of white flour was milled overnight. When another unit of the People's Liberation Army approached Shatushiji, the commander asked the farmer who was leading the way to go home earlier, but the farmer solemnly refused and asked to join the battle, saying: "Our army is fighting, and you want me to go home? Can't I carry a gun with the comrades? I am a militiaman in our village." After the People's Liberation Army stormed into Shatushiji, the masses in the town actively cooperated in searching for and arresting Chiang bandits. An old man braved the artillery fire and found a company commander of the People's Liberation Army and reported: "Come quickly, comrade! A battalion commander is hidden under my bed!" The People's Liberation Army immediately found the battalion commander and a telephone. After the victory of the battle, the masses in nearby villages were overjoyed and rushed to transport the captured artillery and spoils of war in ox carts, with gunshots constantly ringing along the way.

    沙土集之役
    鲁西人民热烈支前
    【新华社华东前线二十一日电】鲁西人民热烈支援华东解放军沙土集歼敌。当解放军某连进入沙土集外围某村作战时，该村室内粮食已被蒋匪抢光，但村干说：“不要紧，俺庄还藏有麦子，有五盘磨，每盘推五十斤，五五二百五，满够同志们吃的了！”说罢就跑到村外通知群众回家取出埋藏的麦子，大批白面遂连夜磨好了。当解放军另一部逼近沙土集，指挥员让带路的农民早点回家，那位农民却庄重的拒绝，并要求参战说：“咱的军队打仗啦，还叫我回家，我跟同志们背枪不行吗，我在俺村是民兵。”当解放军突入沙土集后，该镇群众更积极协同搜捕蒋匪，一位老人并冒着炮火找到解放军某连长报告：“快来！同志，俺家床底下藏着一个营长呀！”解放军当即搜出该营长和一架电话机。战斗胜利结束后，附近各村群众欢欣若狂，纷纷赶着牛车来搬运缴获的大炮和胜利品，沿路枪声不绝。
