    Tai Gu Independent Regiment
    Commends Six People's Fighters
    Bai Daoming and Zhang Zukan, clerks of the Tai Gu Independent Regiment, usually bury themselves in their work with pens, doing writing work. Every battle they actively participated in, resolutely and bravely, holding hand grenades and charging ahead with the soldiers. In the battles of Sigua and Xinglin, they chased the enemy with hand grenades, shouting "Hand over your guns, hand over your guns and we won't kill you." Seeing the situation was not good, the enemy handed over their guns, and they disarmed two or three guns barehanded. In combat operations, they also wrote slogans, distributed leaflets, and shouted slogans to win over the puppet soldiers. Guo Zhenxi and Duan Yu'er, scouts of the regiment headquarters, usually do reconnaissance work. In battle, they charged ahead with the soldiers. The two of them obtained a total of seven rifles and one machine gun in three battles. Each battle also involved communication work. In battle, it was inconvenient for the messengers to deliver messages in military uniforms, so the scouts had to deliver the messages. In the Xinglin battle, they delivered messages three times and even encountered the enemy, chasing them for a while. When the battle started, they bravely charged and fought fiercely, gaining three more guns and two prisoners. Feng Zi'an, a barber of the first and second companies, also served as deputy squad leader in the company. Zhang Yuxiang also served as a messenger in the company and actively worked as a barber. The two of them not only shaved the heads of the company members, but also shaved the heads of the comrades in the regiment headquarters. Whenever they were free, they would go without hesitation whenever they were asked to shave heads. In battle, they were very brave, obtaining two guns in three battles. The above six comrades are all revolutionary outstanding fighters with both literary and military skills, serving three positions in one, worthy of everyone's learning.

    太谷独立团
    表扬六位人民战士
    太谷独立团文书白道明、张祖堪平时拿起笔来埋头苦干，作的是动笔杆工作，每次战斗也都积极参加，并坚决勇敢，手拿着手榴弹和战士们一样冲锋在前，在四卦和杏林战斗中拿着手榴弹追击敌人，喊着“交枪，交枪不杀。”敌人看势不好，就交了枪，他们赤手得枪两三支。在战斗行动中还写标语、散传单、喊口号，争取伪军。团部侦察员郭珍喜、段玉儿平时作的是侦察工作，在战斗中和战士们一样冲锋在前，他俩人在三次战斗中共得步枪七枝，机枪一挺，每次战斗还担任通过工作，在战斗中通信员穿着军衣送信不方便，就得侦察员送信，杏林战斗，他们连送三次信，还和敌人遭遇，追了他们一顿。战斗开始，他们勇敢冲锋，猛冲猛打，又得了三支枪，两个俘虏。一、二连理发员冯自安，在连队兼任副班长，张玉祥在连兼任通信员，并积极担任理发员，他二人不但光给连上剃头，还给团部同志们剃头，只要他有空，随时叫他们剃头，不说二话就去了。在战斗中他们非常勇敢，三次战斗共得枪二支。以上六同志都是文武双全，一顶三职的革命优秀战士，值得大家学习。
