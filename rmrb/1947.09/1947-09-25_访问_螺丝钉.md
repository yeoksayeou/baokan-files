    Visiting the "Screw"
    Yuming
    I visited several "screws" in the military region's political department. They worked silently in every corner, giving off light and heat, without complaint, not talking about enjoyment, and not caring about status or reputation. Seeing them, I couldn't help but feel a deep respect.
  I. Two Vegetable Growing Experts
    On September 6th, I went to participate in the Merit Celebration Conference of the Military Region Political Department. As soon as I arrived, I heard many comrades proudly say that their food was guaranteed: first, they didn't have to worry about not having vegetables to eat, and second, they didn't have to worry about not having meat to eat.
    This is no simple matter! The political department's canteen unit has many guests coming and going, with no fewer than one or two hundred people eating regularly. Calculated over the whole year, they need 120,000 catties of vegetables and have to slaughter seventy or eighty large pigs. But this astonishing number has been resolved. Their food is very good, and now they can eat tomatoes and Napa cabbage every day. These good dishes, which other units can only eat when entertaining guests or at banquets, have become commonplace here. Who deserves the most credit for this work? Old Peng, Old Zhao, and Old Qin should give themselves a thumbs up.
    First, let's talk about Old Peng and Old Zhao.
    Old Peng's name is Peng Jinsheng, and he is an "old revolutionary." He is not tall, and although he wears an old army uniform that is neither green nor yellow, his body is strong and sturdy. He is the person in charge of the vegetable garden at the agency's residence. After dinner in the afternoon, he led me to visit his vegetable garden.
    Ah! What big tomatoes! Upon entering the tomato garden, I saw piles of tomatoes, peeking out from the green leaves, red, pink, and green, a beautiful sight.
    How big is a tomato? Old Peng said with a smile that almost every one weighs about a catty, and the largest weighs three catties. Although the land is small, the tomato production is quite large, and they can eat them heartily every day and for a long time.
    Old Peng is an old hand at growing vegetables, and he has been engaged in this business since 1941. He has a clear understanding of the temperament of general vegetables. He bent down and casually picked a tomato fruit and interestingly began to talk to me about the principles of growing tomatoes. He said, "If you want tomatoes to grow well, the first secret is to choose good seeds. As the saying goes, 'a big mother makes a fat son,' which is absolutely true. Our comrades have a problem, which is that they only like to 'eat fresh.' Leaving seeds from hair tomatoes is best. The earlier the seeds are left, the earlier they will bear fruit and the sweeter they will be next year. If you eat 'fresh' and leave the seeds late, they will also be late next year. Another secret is to prune the leaves. Tomatoes grow suckers, like people going astray. If you go astray, you are energetic, but you can't do proper things well. If tomatoes grow too many suckers, they won't bear fruit or will bear less."
    Passing through the tomato field, I saw a white expanse from afar. I asked Old Peng, "Is that our Napa cabbage?" Old Peng said, "Others can't grow them like that."
    Upon closer inspection, they were indeed well-grown, with leaves larger than a cattail fan, and the wrapped hearts were no smaller than basketballs. I pressed them with my hand, and they were all hard. Old Peng said that each one weighs six or seven catties, even ten catties. Then we went to see the eggplants, pumpkins, peppers... nothing was not enviable. Old Peng and his three partners cultivated a total of eight acres and six points of land. The annual production task is 30,000 catties of vegetables. In the past six months, they have already handed in 580 catties of wheat and 12,500 catties of vegetables. Calculated, they have exceeded the task by more than 3,700 catties.
    He achieved so much in production, but he never talked about how hard he worked. But the facts tell everyone that his efforts have been poured into the vegetable garden. In the first half of the year, the weather was severely dry, and he and his partners watered the land day and night. In two months, they watered a total of more than 84,000 buckets of water and applied more than 80,000 catties of fertilizer. In this long period of 180 days, they only rested for two days.
    Let's talk about Old Zhao, who is on par with Old Peng. He runs a vegetable garden in Handan. But unfortunately, I didn't meet him. His achievements can only be seen from the merit book. Although the text is brief, his work enthusiasm and vigor leap off the page. It reads: "Comrade Zhao Zihong is the leader of the Handan irrigated land production team. He cultivated 18 acres of land. He took the lead in land preparation, sowing, and cultivation. When the vegetables were ripe, he actively sought relationships to sell them. Every day, he carried a vegetable load of 120 catties and walked eight li to Handan City. Sometimes he made two trips a day, leaving before dawn and returning at ten o'clock. After eating, he immediately went to work in the fields, working until dark. At night, he also helped with weeding and feeding livestock. He often slept less than three hours a night and then carried vegetables to sell. If he couldn't sell them all at once, he had to shout along the streets, without feeling ashamed at all. In half a year, he sold about 10,000 catties of vegetables. Sometimes his shoulders were swollen from the pressure, but he still persisted in his work. The villagers said, 'Old Zhao, you are fifty years old, and you still have such great spirit. You really have two good legs!' Old Zhao replied, 'This is my task, and it is right to do so.'"

    访问“螺丝钉”
    毓明
    我访问了军区政治部几个“螺丝钉”。他们在各个角落里，默默地工作着，有一分热，发一分光，没有怨言，不讲享受，不计地位名誉。我见了他们，不禁肃然起敬。
  一、两个种菜能手
    九月六日，我去参加军区政治部的贺功大会。一到那里就听到许多同志自豪的说，他们的伙食有保证了：一不愁没菜吃，二不怕没肉吃。
    这不是个简单的事情！政治部机关伙食单位，客人来来往往很多，经常吃饭的不下一、二百人，全年计算下来，须用菜十二万斤，杀七八十条大猪。但这个惊人的数目解决了。他们的伙食很好，现在每天能吃到西红柿和回子白。别的机关请客或会餐时才能吃到的这些好菜，在这里却成了家常便饭。这个工作谁的功劳最大呢？老彭、老赵和老秦应该伸出他们的大拇指。
    先说老彭和老赵。
    老彭叫彭金生，是个“老革命”。个儿不高，虽穿着一绿不绿、黄不黄的旧军衣，身体结实强壮。机关驻地的菜园负责人就是他。下午吃罢晚饭，他带领着我去参观他的菜园。
    啊！好大的西红柿！进到西红柿园内，只见一堆一堆的西红柿，从绿叶丛里闪露出来，红的粉红，绿碧绿，红绿掩映，煞是好看。
    一个西红柿有多大呢？老彭笑嘻嘻说，差不多每个都在一斤左右，顶大的还有三斤重。地少出产的西红柿可不少，每天痛痛快快的吃，还可吃很长一个时期。
    老彭是个种菜的老干家，从四一年起就干起这门营生。他对于一般蔬菜的脾气，都摸得清清楚楚。他弯下腰去，顺手撇下一个西红柿果子跟我有趣的讲开种西红柿的道理，他说：“要想西红柿长得好，头一个妙诀就是选好种子，常言道，母大儿肥，一点不错。咱们同志有个毛病，就是光好‘吃鲜’，头发西红柿，留种子最好，种子留得越早，第二年越结得早，越甜。吃了‘鲜’，留种子晚了明年也就越晚了。再一个妙诀就是打叶子。西红柿长杈子，好象人走邪路，走邪路劲头大，一走邪路就办不好正经事，西红柿长的杈子多了，就不结或少结西红柿了。”
    穿过西红柿地，很远就看见白花花的一片，我问老彭“那是咱们的果子白吗？”老彭说：“别人的长不了那样。”
    到跟前一看，长得果然体面，叶子比蒲扇还大，裹好的心儿比篮球不小，我用手捺了捺，都是硬梆梆的。老彭说每个都是六七斤，十来斤。接着去看茄子、南瓜、辣椒……没有一样不令人羡慕。老彭和他们三个伙伴，共种了八亩六分地，全年生产任务是三万斤菜，半年以来，他们已经交了五百八十斤麦子，一万二千五百斤菜，折算下来，已超过任务三千七百多斤了。
    生产成绩这么大，但他没有说过自己如何辛苦。但事实告诉大家，他的心血都灌注到菜园里了。前半年天气亢旱，他跟他的伙伴没明没黑的浇地，两个月工夫，共浇了八万四千多戽子的水，还上了八万多斤粪。在这一百八十天的漫长时间里，他们仅仅休息了两天。
    再说和老彭并驾齐驱驱老赵，他是在邯郸经营着菜园的。但遗憾的是没有见面，他的成绩，只能从功劳簿上去看，文字虽然简短，他的工作热情，毅力，生龙活虎的跃然纸上。那上面写道：“赵子洪同志，是邯郸水地生产班长，种了十八亩地，整地、下种、栽培，都是带头干，菜熟了，积极找关系出售，每天担着一百二十斤重的菜担子，往邯郸市走过路程八里，有时一天两趟，天不亮就走了，到十点钟才回来，吃罢饭后，即连忙到地里工作，一直工作到天黑。晚上还帮助锄草、喂牲口。经常夜里睡不到三个钟头，又担着菜去卖了。如果不能一下卖完，还得沿街叫喊，毫不感到丢人。半年共卖菜一万斤左右。有时他的两肩压得肿了，还是一样的坚持着工作。村里老乡说：“老赵你五十岁了，还有这大精神，你真是两只好腿呀！”老赵回答道：“这是我的任务，这样干是应该的。”
