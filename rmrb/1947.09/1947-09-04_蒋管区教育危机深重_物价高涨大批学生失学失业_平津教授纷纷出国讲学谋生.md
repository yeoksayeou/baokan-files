Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 2nd. Comprehensive reports from Beiping and Tianjin: The problems of being out of school and unemployment are plaguing students in Beiping and Tianjin. Of the 451 graduates from Peking University and 296 from Tsinghua University this year, more than two-thirds have not found jobs. Less than one-tenth of the graduates from Beiping Normal College have found teaching positions. At Yenching University, the employment problems of the majority of 110 graduates remain unsolved. Female graduates are even more troubled, as Chiang's agencies refuse to employ women. Tuition fees in large, medium, and small schools in Beiping and Tianjin have increased sharply amidst soaring prices. The miscellaneous fees for private Yenching University have jumped from 150,000 Chiang currency units last semester to 900,000. According to a unified decision by the Beiping Private Middle School Association, high schools are allowed to charge 400,000 to 450,000 Chiang currency units, and junior high schools 300,000 to 350,000. Elementary schools are allowed to charge a maximum of 200,000 Chiang currency units for lower grades and 250,000 for upper grades. Currently, education in the Chiang-controlled areas has effectively become the privilege of the children of wealthy landlords. Since Chiang's Ministry of Education brazenly abolished the public funding system for students, students in pre-university programs at national universities in the Beiping-Tianjin area have formed the "Joint Association for Striving for the Continuation of the Public Funding System for Universities" to protest to Chiang's Ministry of Education in order to maintain their studies. The association has also sent representatives south to contact students in Nanjing and Shanghai. Students in pre-university programs at Jiaotong University and Wuhan University will respond, and they plan to organize a national joint organization to fight for the restoration of the public funding system. Under the pressure of soaring prices and political oppression, professors from universities in Beiping and Tianjin are going abroad to teach one after another. Tang Yongtong, Dean of the Faculty of Arts at Peking University, Wang Jingxi, Head of the Department of Biology, and Deng Siyu, Professor of the Department of History, have already gone abroad. Xiang Da, Professor of the Department of History, and Yang Simeng, Professor of Economics, are waiting for their flights. Professors who have completed their sabbatical leave and are due to return to school are unwilling to return to the country due to the high prices and difficult living conditions in Beiping and Tianjin. Under these circumstances, the faculty at universities in Beiping and Tianjin are feeling strained. Peking University is already short of professors for Chinese History and Western History courses.

　　In the plight of being out of school, unemployed, and unable to make a living, students in Beiping and Tianjin are flocking to the liberated areas of Chahar, the Northeast, and Central Hebei via the Ping-Sui Railway, the Bei-Ning Railway, and Tianjin, seeking a bright future.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 2nd. The inflation and soaring prices caused by Chiang Kai-shek's anti-people civil war have deprived most students of the opportunity to attend school. According to a report from United Press, Shanghai, 31st: After the summer vacation, most students in Shanghai will be deprived of the opportunity to enroll in school. This semester, tuition fees in various schools still exceed the maximum limit set by Chiang's Shanghai Bureau of Education. Elementary school fees are 650,000 Chiang currency units, junior high school fees are 950,000, high school fees are 1,500,000, and universities charge over 2,000,000. The "Committee for Maintaining Students' Rights to Continue Their Education" has emerged in Shanghai, demanding that private schools reduce their fees by 30 percent.

　　蒋管区教育危机深重
  　物价高涨大批学生失学失业
    平津教授纷纷出国讲学谋生
    【新华社陕北二日电】综合平津报讯：失学与失业问题正困恼着平津学生。本届北大毕业生四百五十一人，清华二百九十六人，皆有三分之二以上未找到职业。北平师院毕业生找得教师职位的不足十分之一。燕大一百一十人，职业问题大半数未解决。女毕业生更为烦恼，因蒋记各机关均拒用女性。平津大、中、小学的学费在物价高涨中激增。私立燕大的学杂费由上学期的蒋币十五万一跃而为九十万元，据平市私立中学联合会统一决定，高中规定收费蒋币四十至四十五万元，初中三十至三十五万元。小学方面则规定初小以廿万元，高小以二十五万元为最高额。平市各校伙食如北大、清华及一般私立中学每月均为四十万元，目前蒋管区教育实际上已成为富豪地主子弟的专利品。自蒋家教育部悍然取消公费生制度后，平津区国立大学先修班学生为维持学业计，已组成“争取继续大学公费制度联合会”向蒋政府教育部抗争。该会并已派出代表南下与京、沪学生联络，交大、武大先修班学生均将响应，并拟组织全国性的联合组织为坚持恢复公费制度而斗争。在物价高涨与政治压迫下，平津各大学教授纷纷出国讲学，北大文学院院长汤用彤，生物系主任汪敬熙、史学系教授邓嗣禹等已先后出国，史学系教授向达，经济学教授杨西孟等正在候机中。休假期满，返校的教授，亦因平津物价高涨生活不易而不愿返国，在此情形下，平津各大学师资已感桔据，北大中国史与西洋史一课已缺教授。
    在失学失业无法生活的困境中，平津学生正纷纷经平绥、北宁铁路及天津分赴察哈尔、东北及冀中解放区寻求光明出路。
    【新华社陕北二日电】蒋介石反人民内战所造成的通货膨胀与物价飞腾，剥夺了大部分学生就学的机会，据合众社沪三十一日讯：暑假过后，上海大部分学生将被夺去入学机会。本学期各校收费，仍超过蒋记沪教育局规定之最高限额，小学收费为蒋币六十五万元，初中为九十五万元，高中为一百五十万元，大学则在二百万以上。沪市已出现“维护学生继续求学权利委员会”，要求各私校收费减低百分之三十。
