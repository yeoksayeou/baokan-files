    Taihang Third Administrative Office Directs Counties to Do a Good Job of Supporting the Military Dependents During the Mid-Autumn Festival
    [This newspaper's Taihang dispatch] The Third Administrative Office instructed all counties to do a good job in supporting military dependents during the Mid-Autumn Festival, and to celebrate the victory of our army with work achievements: 1. This year, during the Mid-Autumn Festival, in order to reduce the burden on the people and society and fully support the front lines, in general, gifts should not be given to military dependents, military dependents should not be invited to dinner, and no donations should be made. The focus should be on solving the difficulties of insufficient labor for wheat planting, fertilizer accumulation, autumn harvesting, and autumn plowing, so as to achieve early harvesting, early threshing, and early plowing. At the same time, we should persuade and mobilize the military dependents to work themselves and strive to be models. We have also made many achievements in this work, and countless models have emerged. For example, Yang Lingli, a model military dependent from Huguan, Qin Fusheng, a retired soldier, Zhang Chongxian, a model military dependent from Licheng, Shen Junlan, a model military dependent from Lucheng, Li Laishuan, a model military dependent from Pingshun, × Si Nu, a model military dependent from Changzhi, and Jin Wenli, a retired soldier, emerged in the spring plowing, summer harvesting, and weeding campaigns. We should cultivate more models in this autumn harvest and autumn plowing to improve the work further. 2. Hold a forum for military dependents, revolutionary martyrs' families, and retired soldiers during the Mid-Autumn Festival to solicit their opinions on the substitute farming work and propose improvement measures. 3. After the autumn harvest and autumn plowing work is completed, the specific circumstances of helping and giving preferential treatment should be written in a letter and informed to the soldiers at the front. (Tong Xing, Wu Qiang)
    [Xinhua News Agency Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu, 24th] Taihang Licheng, Wuzhi, Zuoquan and other counties give preferential treatment to the families of cadres who have gone south, and decided to launch a movement to support military dependents before the Mid-Autumn Festival. The Zuoquan County government stipulates that the families of all cadres above the village level in each system who have gone south should be treated preferentially in accordance with the preferential treatment regulations for the military. Each district and village should establish files for cadres transferred out, and select key cadres to be personally managed by designated personnel, so as to be familiar with the cadres' situation and help solve difficulties in a timely manner. Licheng issued instructions a few days ago, ordering all villages to help the families of revolutionary martyrs and cadres with autumn harvesting and wheat planting through mutual aid teams. Wuzhi once held a county-wide meeting of district and village civil affairs cadres, deciding that each village should cultivate land on behalf of the families of military cadres who have no labor force.

    太行三专署指示各县
    中秋做好拥优工作
    【本报太行讯】三专署指示各县于中秋节做好拥优工作，用工作成绩庆祝我军胜利：一、今年中秋节为了减轻人民社会负担，全力支援前线，一般的不给军属送礼，不请军属吃饭，不捐款，而重点应放在解决种麦积肥秋收秋耕劳力不足之困难，做到先收先打先耕。同时我们应说服动员军烈属自己劳动，争取模范。我们在此工作上也做出不少成绩，涌现出无数的模范。如在春耕夏收锄苗运动中涌现出壶关模范军属杨岭利，荣退军人秦福生，黎城模范军属张崇先，潞城模范军属申俊兰，平顺模范军属李来拴，长治模范军属×四女，荣退军人晋文礼等。在这次秋收秋耕中更大量的培养模范，把工作提高一步。二、中秋节召开军烈属荣退军人座谈会，征求他们在代耕工作上的意见，提出改进办法。三、秋收秋耕工作结束后，应将帮助优待具体情形写信告知前方战士。（统兴、武强）
    【新华社晋冀鲁豫二十四日电】太行黎城、武陟、左权等县优待南征干部家属，并决定中秋节前展开拥优军属运动。左权县府规定各系统村级以上南征干部家属一律按优军条例优待。各区村建立外调干部卷宗，并选定主要干部专人亲自管理，以便熟悉干部情况，及时帮助解决困难。黎城日前发出指示，令各村通过互助组，帮助军烈干属收秋种麦。武陟曾召开全县区村民政干部会议，决定各村要为无劳力军干家属代耕。
