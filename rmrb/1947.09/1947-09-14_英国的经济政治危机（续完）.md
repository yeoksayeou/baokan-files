　　The Economic and Political Crisis in Britain (Continued and Completed)
    Qi Sheng
    However, what added fuel to the fire of Britain's dire economic situation was Bevin's unwavering adherence to the Conservative Party's foreign policy. Churchill's principles were: to hate the Soviet Union, support European reactionary forces, and strive to restore the world domination of the British Empire. To this end, Bevin could disregard his country's financial difficulties, spending as much as £150 million on the fascist Greek civil war, and tens of millions of pounds supporting the French and Dutch colonial wars against Vietnam and Indonesia, and subsidizing the troops of General Anders, the Polish exile who had long been reduced to a bandit gang. And in order to maintain its excess troops, Britain not only spent four or five hundred thousand manpower in the country to produce military supplies, but also consumed most of the American loans.
    Not only that, while implementing its reactionary foreign policy, the Labor government also fantasized that the United States could help Britain's recovery. Under Britain's plea for help, the Anglo-American financial agreement, which had been negotiated for years and was concluded in mid-July last year, made the Labor authorities believe that they could safely survive until 1950. Now, only a year later, the destructive effect of this agreement on the British economy has been so great that it has become a major factor in precipitating the current British crisis.
    According to this agreement, the United States cancelled $15 billion in debts owed by Britain under the Lend-Lease Act during the war, and gave Britain a loan of $3.75 billion. However: (1) After the agreement was signed, the United States immediately abolished price controls, causing Britain's loans to lose nearly half of their value. (2) Due to the terms of the loan, Britain was forced to increase its purchases from the United States after the loan was devalued (the so-called "non-discrimination against American goods" - according to the Associated Press on August 21, Britain's purchases from the United States in the first five months of this year reached more than 500 million US dollars, exceeding Britain's exports during the same period by three times). And under the "free convertibility of the pound" clause, Britain not only lost its foreign exchange control outside the sterling area, but also allowed its scarce dollar reserves to flow out steadily. On the one hand, Britain had to pay its trading partners the dollars it lacked (because all countries were experiencing a dollar shortage), and on the other hand, Britain had to use dollars to increase its purchases of high-priced American goods - this is the "assistance" that the Anglo-American financial agreement gave to Britain.
    Since July, Bevin, harboring the illusion of "leading" Europe and "strengthening" Britain's economic position, has "grasped both hands" on the Marshall Plan proposal and actively campaigned for the American plan. He even disregarded Britain's own long-term interests, obstructing the conclusion of the Anglo-Soviet trade negotiations, believing that as long as there was the "Marshall Plan," Britain would have everything. However, the United States thwarted his emotions with the news that "Congress will not consider aid to Europe under the Marshall Plan this year" and the "Ruhr Plan" that excluded British power. While he was puzzled, the economic crisis that shook Britain's international status suddenly arrived.
    　　　×　　　　　　　　　　　×　　　　　　　　　　　　×
    Due to sluggish exports, Britain's annual trade deficit of around $3 billion could only be paid for by foreign loans, and the loans were about to run out. In the 14 months from July last year to August this year, the Labor government spent $3.85 billion of its $4.25 billion in foreign loans (including $500 million in Canadian loans). The remaining US loan is only 400 million US dollars, but it is still frozen by the United States. What will a Britain that cannot live without imports and exports use to pay for its future imports?
    To cope with this situation, the Attlee government announced its "economic war" plan on August 6, and passed the "Power Act" in the House of Commons on the 12th. However, this plan mainly uses the method of increasing the burden on the working class and reducing the living conditions of the people in the country to make up for the country's deficit, and is unwilling to thoroughly reduce the army and change the wage and profit policy, which itself contains many unfavorable factors. No matter how deeply rooted the deception of the British Labor Party leaders is, British workers will never starve themselves to work more efficiently for the capitalists' profits.
    Bevin then appealed again to his American friends, asking for new loans. But on the American side, it was believed that the more serious the British economic crisis, the more beneficial it would be to the United States. Therefore, US Treasury Secretary Snyder has recently stated several times that he would not discuss the issue of new loans to Britain. On the British press side, it has been rumored that the United States has indicated that if Britain accepts (1) maintaining the status quo of its German occupation forces, (2) revising or delaying the domestic industrial nationalization policy, (3) agreeing to US control of the Ruhr Plan, (4) keeping the original loan conditions unchanged, (5) allowing the United States to supervise the use of the loan... and other conditions, then the United States may consider the issue of new aid to Britain. The reason why the Anglo-American meeting to revise the loan conditions, which opened on August 18, ended without results was because these conditions made Britain afraid to continue the talks. The only result of the week-long talks was that the United States approved Britain's suspension of its obligation to freely convert the pound. However, this suspension of convertibility resulted in countries restricting trade with Britain, and its development will further worsen Britain's economic situation. The recent large-scale flight of British private capital under the private assistance of American capital, and the large-scale withdrawal of deposits from British banks by American pound depositors, is an ominous sign.
    The future situation will mainly depend on whether the British coal production plan (4 million tons per week) can be successfully implemented, and the degree and speed of foreign aid that Bevin's foreign policy can achieve. But in any case, before the above conditions appear, Britain's current crisis may have to encounter a further stage of deterioration.
    　　　　　　×　　　　　　　×　　　　　　　×
    The Labor government's inability to revive Britain's post-war economy, and its single-minded reliance on the United States, adopting a foreign policy of leading the wolf into the house, has not only led to the current economic crisis and the decline of Britain's international status, but also greatly weakened its domestic political base. After Attlee's plan to overcome the crisis was announced, he immediately found that the opponents in his party "have increased in number more than the number of people gathered by the 'opposition' before." Last November, the Labor Party members of the House of Commons who were called "rebels" by Attlee for opposing Bevin's foreign policy, today face the Labor government with a two-fold increase in number of 150, accounting for more than one-third of the Labor Party members of the House of Commons. Attlee had no choice but to convene a secret Labor Party caucus meeting on August 11 to stabilize the situation. At the meeting, Bevin for the first time stated that he also "supported the policy of disarmament." When asked to state the Labor government's attitude on the immediate implementation of the nationalization of the steel industry, many cabinet members who opposed the implementation of the law did not dare to insist on it head-on, but had to propose a compromise method for voting. Although their method of "strictly controlling the steel industry before it is actually nationalized" was barely passed, this did not ease the dissatisfaction in the slightest (81 votes were in favor of the compromise, while 77 votes were against, and as many as 100 people abstained). The left-wing's call to abandon the current policy of relying on the United States and immediately resume Anglo-Soviet trade negotiations is now so deeply supported by the British people that the Labor authorities have no choice but to make various concessions on the surface, declaring that "we cannot build our plans on the illusion of American aid." and emphasizing that we must "rely on our own efforts." And according to a Reuters dispatch on August 11, the Labor Party "left-leaning" group, including some fierce critics, will continue to exist in the form of an organized committee during the parliamentary recess (August 14 to October 20). Obviously, if the economic situation continues to deteriorate, and if there is no change in the Labor authorities' domestic and foreign policies, then this kind of division within the Labor Party will inevitably develop further.
    　　　　　　　×　　　　　　　　　×　　　　　　　　×
    Under the economic crisis, on the one hand, domestic dissatisfaction is growing, and on the other hand, American "friends" are trying to take the opportunity to swallow Britain, where is the Labor government going?
    Britain's post-war policy of relying on the United States is rooted in Britain's subjective political ambitions and actual economic difficulties. Britain's attempt to restore the already declining trend of the British Empire, due to the extreme decline of its economic capabilities, unilaterally hopes for American aid; while on the American side, due to its greatly expanded productivity during the war (its production equipment is about twice that before the war), the demand for markets after the war is extremely urgent, and it has long coveted the British Empire's colonies and affiliated countries all over the world. Britain's begging is nothing less than a piece of mutton delivered to the mouth of the American wolf. The history of Anglo-American relations in the past two years is actually the history of the United States setting traps for Britain. Now Britain's real crisis has begun, and the Americans have not only not provided any assistance, but have instead reached out to demand the power to interfere in Britain's internal affairs. Anglo-American relations have indeed reached a crisis point.
    On the other hand, the development of the British crisis will inevitably promote the American crisis. After Britain announced a reduction in imports on August 6, Singapore, Australia, and South American countries such as Chile and Argentina have all announced similar measures. After Britain suspended the free convertibility of the pound, this measure to restrict imports will inevitably become a trend in the current situation where the dollar crisis is sweeping various countries. This will inevitably affect the United States more powerfully and violently in addition to affecting Britain. Under this situation, the United States will definitely become more and more eager to tighten Britain's neck in order to find an escape for its own economic crisis. Although, based on political considerations of saving capitalism and not allowing Britain to go in a direction contrary to American tradition (as was the case when the Anglo-American financial agreement was debated and passed in the US Congress), the United States may still provide new loans to Britain conditionally, but Uncle Sam's attempt to further control Britain will inevitably fail, because he cannot overcome the resistance of the British people. In any case, any possible new "aid" from the United States to Britain, given the historical facts, will not only not improve Britain's economic situation, but on the contrary, it will inevitably lead to the development of Anglo-American contradictions to an even more unmanageable level, and promote the change of the current international relations.

　　英国的经济政治危机（续完）
    齐生
    然而为困窘的英国经济形势火上加油的，还是贝文所坚守不渝的保守党外交政策。邱吉尔的原则是：仇视苏联，支持欧洲反动势力，力图恢复大英帝国的世界统治。为此贝文可以不顾其国家财政的困难，为希腊的法西斯开支数达一亿五千万镑的内战费，并以数以千万计的金镑，支持法荷反对越南与印尼的殖民战争，及津贴早已沦为匪帮的波兰流亡将军安德斯的部队。而为维持其过剩军队，英国不仅在国内耗费四五十万的人力去生产军需品，而且耗费掉大部美国贷款。
    不仅如此，工党政府在执行其反动的外交政策同时，还幻想美国可以援助英国的复兴。在英国求救下，谈判经年而于去年七月中告成的英美财政协定，曾使工党当局以为从此可以安然渡过一九五○年。现在时间仅隔一年，这个协定对英国经济的破坏作用竟如是之大，以致成为促成目前英国危机的一大因素。
    根据这个协定，美国勾消了英国战时所获租借法下债务中的一五○亿美元帐目，并给予英国三十七亿五千万美元贷款。可是：（一）在协定签字之后，美国马上取消了物价管制，使英国借款损失了近一半的价值。（二）由于贷款的条件，英国被迫必须在借款贬值之后，增加对美的购买（所谓“不歧视美货”——据美联社八月二十一日电，英国今年头五个月在美购货达五亿美元以上，超过同期英国之输出三倍）。而且在“英镑自由兑换”条款下，使英国不仅失去其英镑集团之外汇控制，并使其短缺的美元头寸，源源外流。一方面英国必须向其贸易对方付出自己所缺少的美元（因为各国都闹美元荒），另方面英国必须用美元增加对高价美货的购买——英美财政协定所予英国的“援助”，就是如此。
    七月以来，贝文又怀着“领导”欧洲、“加强”英国经济地位的幻想，“双手握紧”马歇尔援欧的建议，积极为美国计划奔走。他甚至不顾英国本身的长远利益，阻挠英苏贸易谈判的达成协议，满以为只要有了“马歇尔计划”，英国就有了一切，可是美国则以“国会年内不会考虑按马氏计划而作的对欧援助”的消息，及排除英国权力的“鲁尔计划”等挫折他的情绪，而当他纳闷之际，震撼英国国际地位的经济危机却骤然而至。
    　　　×　　　　　　　　　　　×　　　　　　　　　　　　×
    输出不振，以致英国年达三十亿美元左右的入超，只能依赖国外贷款支付，而贷款又即将告罄，去年七月迄今年八月的十四个月内，工党政府自其四十二亿五千万美元的国外贷款中（其中包括加拿大贷款五亿美元），用去了三十八亿五千万美元。美国贷款现仅余四亿美元，但是还被美国冻结了。一个没有输入就不能输出，也就不能生活的英国，将以什么来支付其以后的输入呢？
    艾德礼政府为应付此种形势，八月六日宣布了他的“经济战争”计划，并于十二日在下院争取通过了“权力法”。然而这个计划，主要以加重工人阶级负担、降低国内人民生活条件的方法，来弥补国家的亏空，而不愿彻底缩减军队及改变工资与利润政策，其本身就包含了许多不利的因素。英国工党头目的欺骗作用不论如何根深蒂固，英国工人绝不会饿着肚皮为资本家的利润增加工作效率的。
    贝文于是再次向其美国朋友呼吁，要求新的贷款。但在美国人方面，却认为英国经济危机越严重，越对美国有利。因此美财长斯奈德最近几次声明，不谈对英新贷款问题。而英国报界方面，则纷纷传出，美国表示，如果英国接受（一）保持其德国占领军现状，（二）修改或延缓国内工业国有化政策，（三）同意美国控制鲁尔计划，（四）原来贷款条件保持不变，（五）允许美国监督贷款之使用………等等条件，则美国可以考虑对英新援助问题。八月十八日召开的英美修改贷款条件的会议之所以无结果而中止，就因为这些条件使英国不敢谈下去。双方会谈一周，所得唯一结果，仅是美国批准了英国暂停英镑自由兑换义务之履行。可是这一停兑，结果是招致各国限制对英贸易，其发展将更恶化英国的经济形势。最近英国私人资本在美国资本私人援助下的大量外逃，及美国英镑存户之大量向英国银行提取存款，该是一个不吉之兆。
    今后的形势，主要将取决于英国煤产计划（周产四百万吨）是否能顺利实现，及贝文外交政策所能争取到的国外援助之程度与速度。但无论如何，在上述条件出现以前，英国当前的危机，可能还要遭遇一个进一步恶化的阶段。
    　　　　　　×　　　　　　　×　　　　　　　×
    工党政府复兴英国战后经济的无能，及其一心依附美国，采取引狼入室的外交政策，既招致了目前的经济危机及英国国际地位的降落，又使其在国内的政治基础大见削弱。当艾德礼克服危机计划宣布之后，他立即发现他党内的反对者“较以前‘反对派’所纠合的人数增多不少”。去年十一月因反对贝文外交政策而被艾德礼称之为“反叛者”的下院工党议员，今天以人数两倍的增长有一百五十名，约占工党下院议员三分之一强），面对工党政府。艾德礼不能不在八月十一日召开工党秘密党团会议，稳定形势。在会议上贝文首次表示，他也“拥护裁军政策”。当要求工党政府对立即实行钢铁工业国有问题表示态度时，许多反对实行该法的阁员，也不敢作正面坚持，而不能不提出折衷办法要求表决。他们的“在钢铁实际国有以前，对其加以严格管制”办法，虽获勉强通过，但是这并没有丝毫缓和不满的情绪（投票的八十一票赞成折衷案，而七十七票反对，弃权者则达一百票）。左派要求丢弃现行依赖美国政策，及立即恢复英苏贸易谈判的呼声，现在竟如此深受英国人民的赞助，迫使工党当局不能不在表面上作各种迁就的姿态，声明“不能把我们的计划建基于美国援助的假相上。”并强调要“自力更生”。而据路透社八月十一日电讯，包括某些激烈批评者的工党“向左”集团，在国会休会（八月十四至十月二十日）期间，并将以有组织的委员会形式继续存在。显然，经济情况如继续恶化，工党当局之内外政策如无改变，则工党内部此种分裂形势将必更加发展。
    　　　　　　　×　　　　　　　　　×　　　　　　　　×
    在经济危机底下，一方面，国内不满情绪日益增长，另方面美国“朋友”企图趁机吞没英国，工党政府何去何从呢？
    战后英国依附美国的政策，根源于英国主观的政治野心及实际的经济困难。英国恢复大英帝国已倒颓势之企图，由于其经济能力的极度衰败，竟单方面希望美国之援助；而在美国方面，由于其战时大大膨胀了的生产力（其生产设备较战前约增两倍），战后对于市场的要求正极其迫切，它早就垂涎英帝国遍天下的殖民地与附属国。英国的乞求，不啻一块羊肉送到美国恶狼的嘴边。两年来英美关系的历史，实际上就是美国对英国布设圈套的历史。现在英国真正的危机开始了，美国人不但未作任何援助，反而先伸手要求干涉英国内政的大权。英美关系确实到了危机点。
    另方面，英国危机的发展，必然促进美国的危机。八月六日英国宣布减少进口后，新加坡、澳洲、以及南美之智利阿根庭等国，均先后宣布同样措施。在英国停止英镑自由兑换后，这种限制进口的措施，在目前美元危机遍袭各国的情况下，势将成为风潮。这必然于影响英国之余，更有力且猛烈地影响美国。在这种形势下，美国紧勒英国颈项以图为自己的经济危机找求逃脱，定然愈趋愈急。虽然，依据拯救资本主义及不使英国走向与美国传统相反之途的政治考虑（象英美财政协定在美国会辩论通过时那样），美国也许还可能有条件地对英作新的贷款，但是山姆大叔进一步控制英国的企图，必遭失败，因为他无法克服英国人民的抵抗。无论如何，美国对英的任何可能的新“援助”，鉴于以往的史实，不但不会改善英国的经济形势，相反，必致英美矛盾发展到更加不可收拾，而促使目前的国际关系的改观。（一九四七年八月下旬）
