Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, September 11th: Reports from all sides indicate that since the Partition of India Memorial Day on August 15th, riots and bloodshed in India have continued to escalate, and major cities are now in a state of unprecedented chaos. According to a United Press report on the 9th, the Indian-Muslim conflict in New Delhi has resulted in approximately 10,000 casualties. Trucks loaded with corpses can be seen passing through the streets daily, and the city falls into a terrifying atmosphere of arson, looting, and murder every night. Since the end of last month, the number of people killed in mutual killings in the Calcutta urban area alone has reached thousands of Indian, Muslim, and Sikh people. Disturbances in Bombay are also expanding. The sounds of gunfire and bomb explosions are frequently heard every evening after dusk, and the riots have even spread to Karachi, the capital of Pakistan. According to an official Pakistani statement on the 9th, more than 3,000 people died in the conflict on the 8th. Approximately 2,000 non-Muslims continue to flee the city every day. The Prime Ministers of India and Pakistan issued an order on the 9th: all Indian and Muslim believers who participate in murder, looting, and arson will be executed on the spot. Suppression teams from the two autonomous regions of India and Pakistan are constantly rushing to riot areas for reinforcement. Major cities in New Delhi are now under military emergency martial law.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, September 11th: Moscow News: The Soviet "Labor Daily" recently published an article by Stolyarov commenting on British policy towards India, stating that the "transfer of power" implemented by Britain in India still adheres to the old trick of divide and rule. While formally relinquishing governance, it actually maintains control over the fate of India. Britain is extremely concerned with grasping the main economic lifelines and military of India as much as possible, but ignores the Indian people's request to withdraw troops stationed in India. This partition plan is based on different religious beliefs and divides India into two countries, Hindu and Muslim, so Indian-Muslim conflicts are more intense than before. Stolyarov analyzed the reasons why Britain implemented the "transfer of power," saying: "The crux of the matter is that after the end of World War II, Britain realized that it could no longer maintain its rule in India by force, so it played this last trick." The article continued: "After the establishment of the two autonomous regions of India and Pakistan, tens of millions of Indian people are fighting for their true independence and democracy. The Indian labor movement has played a prominent role in opposing the Indian-Muslim conflict instigated by British imperialism and its lackeys. Trade unions are organizing volunteer teams and mediation committees to conduct extensive propaganda. Even in Calcutta, the heart of the mutual killings, trade unions were able to quickly stop the fights provoked by provocateurs and restore peace. For the unity of India and Islam and the expulsion of British imperialist forces, the majority of progressive people in India are waging a struggle to the end.

　　英帝国主义煽动印回冲突
  　骚乱血案不断扩大
  　印度职工会组义勇队奋勇调解
    【新华社陕北十一日电】各方讯：自八月十五日印度分治纪念日以来，印度骚乱血案不断扩大，现各大城市已呈显空前之混乱状态。据合众社九日讯：新德里印回冲突造成一万人左右之伤亡，每日可见满载死尸之拖车过街，该城入夜即陷入纵火、抢劫、谋杀等恐怖气氛中。自上月底迄今，仅加尔各答市区，在自相残杀中，牺牲即已数千名印回及锡克族群众。孟买市的骚扰亦扩大中，每日黄昏后该城枪击声与炸弹爆炸声时有所闻，骚乱甚至扩至巴基斯坦首都喀剌嗤。据巴基斯坦官方九日声明称：在八日冲突中，死亡者在三千名以上。首都非回族每日有二千人左右继续离城逃亡。印度斯坦与巴基斯坦总理于九日下令：凡参加杀人、强掠及纵火之印回教徒一律就地处决。印、巴两自治领之镇压队不断赶赴骚乱区增援，新德里各大城市现处于军事紧急戒严状态中。
    【新华社陕北十一日电】莫斯科讯：苏联劳动报顷刊载斯托尔雅洛夫评述英国对印政策之论文称：英在印度实行的“权力转移”，仍是恪守分而治之的老一套。在形式上放弃统治权，但实际上则仍保持对印度命运的控制。英国极关心尽可能将印度主要经济命脉和军事抓到自己手里，但对印人所要求的撤退驻印军队则加漠视。这一分治计划是基于不同的宗教信仰而把印度分裂成印度教和回教两国，因而印、回冲突比以前更加激烈。斯氏分析英国实行“权力转移”的原因称：“症结在于二次世界大战结束后，英国深知不能再用武力维持在印度之统治，于是搞了这最后一着。”该文继称：“在印度斯坦和巴基斯坦两自治领成立后，数千万印度人民正为他们真正的独立和民主而奋斗。印度职工运动在反对英帝国主义及其走狗煽起的印、回冲突中，起了卓越的作用。职工会正在组织义勇队和调解委员会，进行广泛宣传。职工会甚至能在自相残杀中心地区的加尔各答，曾非常迅速地阻止挑拨者所挑起的格斗，并恢复和平。为印回两教的统一和驱逐英帝国主义势力，印度大多数进步人士进行坚持到底的斗争。
