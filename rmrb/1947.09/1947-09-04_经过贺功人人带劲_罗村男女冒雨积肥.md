(Reported by our newspaper from Taiyue on the 2nd) Luo Village, Tunliu Fifth District, a complete administrative village (five natural villages), held a meritorious service celebration meeting for over 500 people on the 10th of last month. At the meeting, they summarized their achievements in cutting artemisia and composting manure in the past five days, laying the foundation for increased production next summer. After the cadres' meeting on the 15th, the mutual aid groups in each natural village, every household and every individual, set out plans for cutting artemisia and composting manure to earn merit. Although it had been raining continuously for several days, more than 400 men, women, and children in the village still wore straw hats and carried burlap bags, determined to complete their plans despite the rain. By the 20th, they had composted 100,287 loads of manure. According to experienced old farmers, applying 40 loads of manure per mu can increase production by 4 dou. This manure can be applied to 2,582 mu of land, potentially increasing production by 1,032 shi and 8 dou. At the meeting, five special-class merit holders, including Guan Suo, who exceeded their artemisia cutting plans and were able to organize everyone to cut artemisia and compost manure, were selected and awarded a merit flag. Other merit holders received prizes. Finally, everyone set out their meritorious service plans for the next month, continuing to concentrate their efforts on cutting artemisia and composting fertilizer, ensuring that each mu of wheat land receives 60 loads of manure and each person plants one mu of barley. This can increase the production of wheat land by 1,653 mu. They will strive to hoe three times in late autumn. Each village will ensure that all workers, blacksmiths, and all working personnel are involved in this movement. Women guarantee to increase the number of hand-cranked machines by 30 and accelerate 110 spinning wheels before the meritorious service celebration meeting on September 19th, and 70 people will learn to use shuttle looms to weave cloth. Everyone unanimously declared: "Let's compete again at the next meritorious service celebration meeting."

(Reported by our newspaper from Jinnan on the 1st) "Accumulate fertilizer to increase production and harvest more wheat." The mutual aid brigade of Lao Ying Yuluo Shan in Xishage Ta, Jixian County, is preparing to plant 360 mu of wheat, guaranteeing three large carts of manure per mu. They have already accumulated 740 carts of manure and plan to accumulate another 168 carts. Their experience is to pour water after livestock are herded out of the pens, and if the pig manure is not used up, leave it and use rainwater to compost it. The manure heats up and ferments easily. They said with great confidence in accumulating fertilizer: "Look at the good wheat seedlings in our fields next year!" As early as when hoeing seedlings, the masses in Wubei Village, Guangzong, vigorously accumulated fertilizer in preparation for planting wheat. The entire village has a total of 160 households, raising 185 pigs, and digging 150 manure pits. In more than a month, they accumulated a total of 3,120 large carts of fertilizer. The entire village has a total of 1,412 mu of wheat land, with an average of two large carts of manure per mu. According to the masses, each mu can yield an additional 60 jin of wheat with enough manure. According to this calculation, the entire village can harvest an additional 85,920 jin of wheat.
