Xinhua News Agency, Jicha Rehe Liao, 21st. Since mid-July, the people's armed forces in Chahar Province have taken the initiative to attack and opened up a vast guerrilla area stretching from Kangbao in the north to Zhangbei in the south, running through Baoyuan (newly established county) and the Left Banner of Taibus Temple, further expanding and consolidating the two grassland areas in the north and south. In one month, from July 20th to August 20th, they fought 17 battles, killing, wounding, and capturing a total of 461 enemy soldiers below the rank of company commander. They seized 6 machine guns, over 100 rifles and short guns, and over 10,000 rounds of ammunition. They destroyed 12 pseudo-civilized townships belonging to the Jiang-Fu bandit Kangbao and Shangdu counties, and 3 important strongholds such as Baimiaotan and Damiao, annihilating a team of Zhang Xuanqing's "Chahar Provincial Infantry Security Forces" of the Jiang bandits in Baimiaotan, and seriously attacking Renqin Daoerji's department of the Mongolian traitor Buriat Banner, who had just fled from Duolun to Mala Ga. At the moment, the Jiang-Fu bandits are short of troops and are in a state of panic, unable to attend to all tasks.
