　　Beiping and Shanghai Newspapers Comment:
    Chiang Clique's International Status Declines Daily, Japan Will Again Threaten China
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 6th] Beiping's semi-official "Chronicle" and Shanghai's "Ta Kung Pao" acknowledged that under Chiang Kai-shek's rule, China's international status is declining daily. According to an Associated Press dispatch from Beiping on the 3rd, the Chronicle, on the second anniversary of Japan's formal surrender, fiercely criticized China (Chiang government) for having lost its position as one of the four or five great powers. The newspaper stated: Judging from Wedemeyer's mission to investigate China and Korea, it is evident that China's (KMT-controlled areas') status is no higher than that of Korea. Korea is not independent, but at least there is no hunger or civil war there. According to a TASS dispatch from Shanghai on the 5th, the Ta Kung Pao stated in an editorial: Due to the support of the United States, Japan's threat to China is increasing day by day. The newspaper stated: "When China rose and then declined, Japan rose again. Japan's unconditional surrender has truly proven to be an unprecedented act of humility, yet there are still some people (referring to the United States) encouraging and protecting Japanese militarism and conservative forces." The newspaper also stated that the current dangerous situation in the Far East is caused, on the Chinese side, by the Kuomintang authorities' unwillingness to "seek democracy and unity after the war and immediately begin national construction."

　　北平上海报纸评称：
    蒋党国际地位日低日本又将威胁中国
    【新华社陕北六日电】北平半官方的“纪事报”与上海“大公报”承认在蒋介石统治下中国之国际地位日形低落。据美联社北平三日电，纪事报于日本正式投降二周年纪念日，猛烈抨击中国（蒋政府）已失去在四强或五强之一的地位。该报称：从魏德迈之中韩调查使命看来，足见中国（蒋管区）的地位并不比朝鲜高。朝鲜不是独立的，但至少那里没有饥饿，没有内战。另据塔斯社上海五日电，大公报于社评表示：由于美国的扶植，日本对中国的威胁刻又与日俱增。该报称：“当中国起而复衰的时候，日本又东山再起。日本无条件投降已经真正证明是一种史无前例的谦卑行为，仍然有若干人（按指美国）的鼓励和庇护日本军国主义以保守势力。”该报并表示，目前远东危险局势之造成，在中国方面是由于国民党当局不愿意“在战后求得民主与统一，并立即着手建设国家”所致。
