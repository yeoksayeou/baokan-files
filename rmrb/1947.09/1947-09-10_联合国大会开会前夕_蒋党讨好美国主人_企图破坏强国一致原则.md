　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 6th. A Reuters reporter reported from Nanjing on the 1st that Wang Shijie, the Foreign Minister of the Chiang government, would call for a swift convocation of a peace conference with Japan at the UN General Assembly. Regarding the voting procedure for the peace treaty with Japan, Wang Shijie stated: "China (Chiang government) will support a two-thirds majority voting system and oppose the veto power." Reuters' report was hastily denied by the Central News Agency on the 2nd, but Wang Shijie's remarks in Beijing on the 5th fully revealed the Chiang government's intention to curry favor with American imperialism on the issue of the peace treaty with Japan. Wang stated when discussing his attendance at the UN General Assembly: "I will take this opportunity to go to New York to maintain contact with the leaders of countries directly related to the resolution of the peace treaty with Japan." Regarding the Chiang government's reply in July to the US invitation to attend the preparatory meeting for the peace treaty with Japan, he stated: "China (Chiang government) is willing to make some concessions on the veto power for the proposed meeting." According to the same Reuters report, the Chiang government is also attempting to collude with Japan through the relationship of the peace treaty with Japan, forming an American, Japanese, and Chiang system to replace the past Japanese, Manchukuo, and Wang Jingwei system, willingly becoming the number two running dog of American imperialism against the democratic forces of the Far East people. A high-ranking official of the Chiang government told Reuters reporters: "China (Chiang government) hopes that Japan, under the thorough training of the Allied (American) Supreme Commander, may become part of a solid anti-communist defense line."
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 6th. On the eve of the convening of the United Nations General Assembly, the Chiang government is prepared to undermine the United Nations' five-power consensus agreement voting procedures in order to please its American masters. According to a United Press report from Shanghai on the 3rd, citing the Shanghai News and the China Morning Post's Nanjing dispatches: "The Chinese (Chiang) government has been meticulously studying the veto power issue, which is expected to be the main topic of the United Nations General Assembly. China, which enjoys one of the five national veto powers, supports a compromise between the current provisions of the United Nations Charter and the small countries' proposal to completely abolish the veto power." Wang Shijie also stated to the press in Beijing on the 5th: "The Chinese (Chiang) government believes that the solution to this major issue lies in reaching a general agreement on the rational use of the veto power," "The Chinese (Chiang government) is fully prepared to respect the reasonable restrictions imposed by the General Assembly on the use of the veto power" (Central News Agency). It is reported that the Chiang government appointed Wang Shijie as the chief representative to the United Nations General Assembly on the 30th, and Wang is scheduled to fly to the United States from Shanghai today.

  　企图破坏强国一致原则
    【新华社陕北六日电】路透社记者一日自南京报导，蒋政府外长王世杰将在联合国大会号召迅速召开对日和会。在对日和约表决程序上，王世杰曾表示：“中国（蒋政府）将拥护三分之二多数表决制而反对否决权。”路透社此一报导，中央社慌忙于二日出而否认，但王世杰五日在京谈话中已充分透露蒋政府在对日和约问题上讨好美国帝国主义的用心，王氏在谈及出席联合国大会时表示：“本人将假此赴纽约之便，与对日和约之解决直接有关之各国领袖保持接触。”谈及蒋政府七月间答复美国邀请出席对日和约预备会议复文内容称：“中国（蒋政府）愿对拟议中的会议之否决权作某种让步。”又据路透社同上电透露，蒋政府并企图通过对日和约关系与日本勾结，构成美、日、蒋体系，代替过去日、满、汪体系，甘心做美帝国主义反对远东人民民主势力的第二号走狗，蒋政府一高级官员对路透社记者称：“中国（蒋政府）希望日本在盟（美）军最高统帅部的彻底训练下，可能成为反共产主义的坚固防线的一部分。”
    【新华社陕北六日电】在联合国全体大会召开前夕，蒋政府已准备破坏联合国五强一致协议的表决程序，以讨好其美国主人。据合众社沪三日电引上海新闻报及中国晨报南京专电称：“中国（蒋）政府一直在缜密研究预料将为联合国大会主要议题的否决权问题，享有五国否决权之一的中国，赞成在联合国宪章现行条款与小国所提完全废除否决权的意见之间采取折衷方案。”王世杰五日在京对报界的谈话亦称：“中国（蒋）政府认为解决此一重大问题实系于就否决权之合理使用一点能获致一般性之协议”，“中国（蒋政府）完全准备尊重联大对否决权之使用加以合理限制”（中央社）。按蒋政府已于三十日任命王世杰为出席联合国大会首席代表，王定今日由沪飞赴美国。
