          —Editor

When the Three Checks Movement started, I always thought that my family was a liberated household and there was nothing to check. But when I really checked, I found that I had become a "bomb shelter" for the landlord class. Therefore, I am willing to write down the whole process and my understanding today as a reference for everyone to check their own thoughts.

I. How I Became a Bomb Shelter

After my family was liberated, I also lived in school. At this time, I still wanted to find a wife. But because I had the idea of ​​loving the rich and disliking the poor, I didn't want to find a poor family. I wanted to find someone stronger than me, and I also wanted her to be educated. At that time, I felt that the daughters of rich people looked good and obedient, so I found such a wife.

Someone had talked to me about this wife before the mass movement (during the War of Resistance), but she was unwilling, especially because her family looked down on me because my brothers were numerous and our family property was small. At that time, the landlord class had not yet been threatened by this farmer's bomber, so naturally there was no need to find me as a bomb shelter. When the mass movement was in full swing, the landlord class felt the need to find a bomb shelter to hide, so she was willing to marry me again. At this time, I thought she looked up to me and was very happy, but I didn't understand that I had become her bomb shelter.

II. My Father-in-Law's Conspiracy and Tricks

My father-in-law treated his daughter as a piece of fat meat and used her to seduce cadres everywhere. When a county cadre was sick, he asked his daughter to take gifts to visit him, wanting to use marriage as a pretext to seduce the cadre and make him a bomb shelter for his family. After searching everywhere, he found me. I remember that when I married his daughter, he said, "I only have one son, this is my only seedling. If I am beaten to death by others (referring to the peasants), you must take care of him until he grows up..." At that time, my class stand was unstable, and I easily stood on his side, agreeing to take care of the son of the counter-revolutionary landlord class, so that he could avenge his father when he grew up. This was completely standing on the landlord class's position. Thinking about it today, I feel very scared.

III. Is My Wife Closer to Me or to Her Father?

In the past, I didn't analyze my wife with a class perspective. I felt that she was so-so to me. In fact, she regarded me as a bomb shelter and was not really close to me. For example, when we got married, she insisted that I wear city-made cloth clothes. Although I was liberated, I didn't have city-made cloth. When I gave her coarse cloth, she said, "If you have coarse cloth, can't you exchange it for city-made cloth?" I succumbed to her and exchanged the cloth that my mother had spun day and night, which could make three sets of clothes, for the city-made cloth that could only make one set of clothes. Think about it, if she really married me and was close to me, would she force me like this? Conversely, she was worried every day that her father would be beaten to death by the peasants, and she was unhappy all day because of this. Look! Who is she closer to? Isn't it very clear?

IV. Unwilling to Say My Father-in-Law is a Landlord

Because I had a blood relationship with the landlord class, I didn't want others to say that my father-in-law's family was a landlord, so I explained it to people like this: "My father-in-law's family is not a landlord who rents out land, but just a tail-cutter household..." This was protecting the landlord class, unwilling to let people know that I was a bomb shelter, and willing to keep the secret so that the landlord class could hide better. Everyone, look, this is such a serious landlord class ideology!

V. Their Position is Very Clear

As I said just now, if my wife's father was beaten to death by the peasants, she would definitely show unhappiness. Is it just a superficial unhappiness? She is close to her father, so she hates the peasants and opposes the peasants. You say, isn't their position clearly standing on the landlord class's side? And I myself was also a little uneasy because of this, afraid that beating her father would affect her, and if she had problems, I was afraid that it would affect me. Look how closely I was connected to the landlord class. Isn't this standing on the landlord class's position?

VI. Originally to Consolidate the Bomb Shelter

After getting married, I felt that she was okay to me, but I didn't realize how good I was to her, nor did I realize that she was good to me because I had become her bomb shelter. Because you, this bomb shelter, can temporarily hide her family, so she is nicer to you and cherishes you more. My wife really expressed her willingness to be good to me forever, seemingly afraid that I would divorce her. At that time, I thought that she might be loyal to me, and she was willing to be good to me forever, so I could only see her advantages, saying that she had a forward-looking heart and progressive demands, and she would definitely be transformed. In reality? She was consolidating my bomb shelter, meaning: As long as the peasants' land reform movement doesn't pass, you will hide my family for a day, and you must hide them well. For example, she said: "You don't contact my family enough." This means: "You, this bomb shelter, have to hide my family even better. I am good to you for this." But I still thought that she and I had a good relationship, which is really problematic when I think about it. Now I feel that my bomb shelter must be dug open, otherwise the peasants' plane should bomb me, the "bomb shelter", together.

VII. Recognizing This is the Enemy

Although I realized that it must be dug, and if it wasn't dug, I would be destroyed along with it, I still showed irresolution and lack of decisiveness when digging. For example, my father-in-law asked me to find a job for his son before. Although I refused, I still thought in my heart: Am I afraid of causing dissatisfaction with my father-in-law's family, and my wife will not be good to me? This means that I have not yet recognized my wife and father-in-law's family as enemies of the revolution. If I were a revolutionary, they would also be my enemies, so I did not dare to break with them, for fear of offending them. This is also because I had been a bomb shelter for them and stood on their position. If I can truly recognize that the landlord class's wife and father-in-law are indeed class enemies, then I will see that this enemy is even more powerful than the enemy in front. They are always in front of you, so if you don't recognize them as enemies, you will suffer a great loss.

VIII. Cutting off All Ties vs. Divorce

I thought like this! To separate from the landlord class, I must cut off all ties with my father-in-law's family and never associate with them, but I don't have the courage to resolutely divorce my wife.

Some comrades advocate divorce! But I also thought, would divorce solve the problem ideologically? That is to say, the bomb shelter has not been dug open, but only the shelterer has been pulled away from the entrance of the cave. Can it be guaranteed that no one will come to hide again? This cannot be guaranteed. So today, the key to the problem is not cutting off all ties or divorce or not, but the problem of resolutely reflecting on one's thoughts. If we truly recognize in our minds that being a bomb shelter is inappropriate, and we dig open the bomb shelter and hand everything over to the peasants to handle, will the people hiding inside sit still? Can the peasants not know how to deal with the people inside?

IX. The Key Lies in the Wife

As I said just now, the key is the wife, that is to say, this bomb shelter was built by the wife herself. In addition to hiding herself, she also asked her whole family to hide. Now, no matter what, the bomb shelter is dug open, and no one can hide. I think my father-in-law, mother-in-law, etc., are all bullshit, but I always have some lingering feelings for my wife, so this is the key.

The problem is to see who she follows at this time. Does she follow her parents to find another bomb shelter or counterattack the peasants? Or does she resolutely bow her head to the peasants? If she can resolutely bow her head to the peasants and ask the peasants to examine her crimes, she will have a chance to be transformed. This is a matter of life and death, and everything depends on her own choice.

X. Exposing My Wrong Worldview

I married the landlord's daughter, knowing that she was from the landlord class, but I felt that her father was a bad person, and she was not necessarily a bad person; holding the reactionary worldview of so-called "picking fruits instead of cutting down trees." Today, I think that I was completely standing on the landlord class's position. I think that a peasant-born person marrying a landlord's daughter must consider: How did they come together? Has the landlord class's daughter progressed? Has she stood on the peasant's position? The result of my examination is not so, but it is the peasant who has stood on the landlord class's position! Therefore, we comrades who marry the landlord class's daughters must be vigilant and treat her as a class enemy. As for whether she can be transformed and progress, it all depends on her. If she is determined to transform, the peasants will allow her to transform. If she is unwilling, the peasants will deal with her even more. No matter what, we must have a clear understanding in our minds and not be their bomb shelters anymore.

### 再不给地主女儿当“防空洞”（三查反省笔记）

    再不给地主女儿当“防空洞”（三查反省笔记）
    这是一篇反省笔记，作者总算坦白地写出了自己思想上的问题，但他究竟解决得对不对呢，还望大家讨论。
          ——编者
    三查运动开始时，自己总以为自己家里是翻身户，没有什么可查。可是真的一查，发现自己竟当了地主阶级的“防空洞”。所以我愿把整个过程和我今天的认识写在下面，作为大家查自己思想时参考。
    一、怎样当了防空洞
    自己家里翻了身后，自己也住了学校，这时还想找个老婆。但由于我有嫌贫爱富的思想，不愿找穷人家，愿找个比咱强的，还要求是念过书的。当时觉得有钱人家的闺女长的好看也顺当，结果就找到了这样一个老婆。
    这个老婆在群众运动前（抗战时期）也有人给我谈过，可是人家不愿意，特别是她家里嫌咱弟兄们多家产少看不起咱来。那时候地主阶级还没有被这架农民的轰炸机威胁，自然也就没有找我这座防空洞的必要。到了群众运动轰轰烈烈展开的时候，地主阶级感到须要找个防空洞隐蔽一下，所以人家又愿和咱结婚了，这时自己以为人家是看起咱来了，觉得很高兴，不了解是当了人家的防空洞。
    二、老丈人的阴谋诡计
    我老丈人把他闺女当作一块肥肉到处勾哄干部，有一个县干部病了，他叫他闺女拿上礼物去打看，想以和他结婚为名来勾哄上杆，给他家当个防空洞。在到处乱找之后就找到了我。我记得，在我和他闺女结婚时他曾说：“我只有一个小子，这是我的一苗根，如果我叫人家（指农民）打死了，你要给咱照顾他长大……”。当时自己的阶级立场不稳，就很容易地站到人家那面去了，答应了照顾反革命地主阶级的儿子，以便将来成人长大后，给他父亲报仇。这样完全是站到了地主阶级立场，今天想起来很觉可怕。
    三、老婆是和咱亲还是和人家爹亲？
    我过去没有拿阶级眼光来分析自己的老婆，觉得马马糊糊她对自己还可以。实际上人家是把自己当成了防空洞，其实并不和自己真正亲。如在结婚时，就非问我要穿市布衣服不行。咱虽然翻了身可是还没有市布，给人家粗布，人家说：“你有粗布就换不成市布？”自己却向人家屈服，把自己的娘连明澈夜纺织下能做三身衣服的布，给人家换了仅能做一身衣服的市布。你想，人家如果真心和咱结婚，和咱亲的话，还会这样逼坑咱吗？反过来说人家却每天在耽心她爹怕被农民打死，因这成天不高兴，你看！这到底和谁亲呢，不就很明白了吗。
    四、不愿说丈人家是地主
    由于咱和地主阶级结了血肉的亲戚，就不愿让别人说自己的丈人家是地主，所以给人这样解释：“俺丈人家不是出租土地的地主只是个割尾巴户……”。这是袒护地主阶级，不愿叫人知道自己这个防空洞，愿保守好秘密以便叫地主阶级隐蔽得更好。大家看，这是多么严重的地主阶级思想意识呀！
    五、人家的立场很明显
    刚才说过，如果我老婆爹被农民打死，人家一定是表现不高兴，难道就只单是一个表面的不高兴吗？人家就是和人家爹亲，所以就痛恨农民，反对农民。你说这，人家的立场还不是明显的站在地主阶级方面上吗？而我自己也因此有些不安，怕打死她爹影响到她，她有了问题又怕影响到我，你看和地主阶级连的多紧，这还不是站到了地主阶级立场是什么？
    六、原来是为了巩固防空洞
    结婚后自己感到人家对自己还可以，而没有认识清自己对人家如何好，也没有认识清是因为自己做了人家的防空洞，人家才对你好，因为你这个防空洞暂时能隐蔽住人家，所以人家对你好些，爱护你些。我老婆真曾表示愿永远和我好，似乎是怕我和她离婚。当时自己想，可能她对我就是忠实，就是愿和我永远好到底，因此自己只能看到她的优点，说她有前进心，有进步要求，一定好改造。实际呢？人家是为了巩固咱这个防空洞，意思就是说：只要农民土改运动一天没过去你就把俺一家隐蔽一天，并且要隐蔽好。比如人家说：“你和俺家里联系的不够。”这就是说：“你这个防空洞还得把我家隐蔽得更好一些。我和你好就是为了这。”可是自己还认为人家是和咱处的好感情好哩，想起来真成问题。现在我感觉到，我这个防空洞非挖开不可了，要不然农民这个飞机就应该连我这个“防空洞”一齐炸了。
    七、认清这是敌人
    虽然认识到非挖不行，不挖也要连自己炸坏，但自己在挖时还表现了不坚决与不干脆。如俺丈人在前时候叫我给他儿子找工作，自己虽然拒绝了，可是心里还这样想：怕不怕引起丈人家的对我不满，我老婆和我不好呢？这就是说还没有把自己的老婆与丈人家认成是革命的敌人，如果自己是个革命者的话，也是自己的敌人，因此还不敢和他们决裂，唯恐得罪了人家，这也是由于给人家当过防空洞，站到人家立场上的原故。如能真正认识到地主阶级的老婆与丈人确是阶级的敌人，那就会看出这个敌人比前方的敌人还厉害，他成天在你跟前，所以你如果不认清他是敌人的话，你就会吃大亏。
    八、一刀两断与离婚
    自己这样想！要想和地主阶级分家必须和丈人家一刀两断，永不交往，可是又没有勇气和老婆坚决离婚。
    有的同志主张干脆离婚！可是我又这样想离了是不是思想上就解决问题了呢？就是说这个防空洞没有挖开，而只是把防空者从洞口上拉走。这样是不是就会没有人再来隐蔽呢？这是不敢保证的，所以说今天问题的关键不是一刀两断与离婚不离婚的问题，而就是思想上下决心反省的问题。如果咱的思想上真正认识了作防空洞的不应当，把防空洞挖开了，一切交农民处理，这样防空洞里面隐蔽的人还会坐着不动吗，农民还能不知如何处理里面的人吗？
    九、关键在于老婆
    刚才说过关键是老婆，就是说这个防空洞是老婆自己出力打下的，打下是除她自己隐蔽外，还叫自己全家隐蔽。现在不管怎样，防空洞是挖开了，谁也隐蔽不住了。丈人丈母等等，自己倒觉得扯蛋，而对老婆总有些留恋，所以说这就是个关键。
    问题就是在这时候看她跟谁。跟上她爹娘再去找防空洞或向农民反攻呢？还是下决心大胆的向农民低头。如果她能决心向农民低头，叫农民审查她的罪行的话，就有改造的机会。这是个生死关头，一切在于她自己的选择。
    十、揭发自己的错误人生观
    自己和地主闺女结婚，明知道人家是地主阶级，可是自己觉得她爹是坏人，她不一定也是坏人；抱着所谓“摘果子而不是砍树”的反动人生观。我今天想起我这完全是站到了地主阶级立场，我觉得一个农民出身的人和一个地主闺女结婚，这就必须考虑：到底是怎样合到一块儿的？地主阶级的闺女进步了吗？站到农民立场上来了吗？”我检查的结果不是如此，而正是农民站到了人家地主阶级立场上了！所以说我们和地主阶级闺女结婚的同志必须提高警惕，把她当作阶级敌人看待；至于她能不能改造与进步全在于她。下决心愿改造的话，农民会允许她改造，不愿的话农民更会处理，不管怎样我们思想上要认识清，不要再作了他们的防空洞。
