Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th: Rome dispatch: The wave of large-scale strikes by Italian workers protesting the authorities' economic policies and soaring prices has spread from Northern Italy to the entire nation. The leaders of the Italian Communist Party and Socialist Party have recently decided to hold a national demonstration and march against high prices on September 20th. As of the 12th, the number of strikers has surged to 1.6 million. According to a TASS dispatch on the 14th, "The possibility of a national strike has emerged." The strike by forestry employees has begun throughout Italy. Workers and staff at Italian cement plants, which produce 60% of the nation's cement, have joined the strike. The strike by 18,000 textile workers in the central city of Prato has received the support of a general strike by all workers in the city. Major industrial centers and ports such as Genoa and Livorno have successively held one-day general strikes and grand demonstrations and protests. The Italian Metallurgical Industry Workers Union, due to the factory's refusal to reduce working hours from September 14th in order to accommodate 200,000 unemployed metallurgical workers, has issued a "warning that a nationwide strike will be held." The strike by agricultural workers in the provinces of the Po River basin in Northern Italy has lasted for six days as of the 14th and is continuing to expand. Vigilance groups in strike alert zones are preventing landlords from sabotaging strike activities, and conflicts between striking workers and landlords and their lackeys have occurred in many areas.
