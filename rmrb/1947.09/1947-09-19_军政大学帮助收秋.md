　　Military and Political University Helps with Autumn Harvest
    [Our Newspaper] In order to help local masses rush the autumn harvest and wheat planting, so as to move into land review, all cadres and students of the Military and Political University, despite their extremely busy schedules approaching graduation, devoted three days to fully cooperate with local masses in rushing the autumn harvest. On August 30th, the Political Department of the University instructed all brigades to conscientiously implement this work, and stipulated that graduating students should help for one day, and undergraduates should help for two days. Organ cadres and administrative personnel should appropriately increase their time depending on the circumstances of their unit. The instructions also pointed out: (1) Cooperate with local cadres to conduct a good survey of the target groups, ensuring no waste of labor and no assistance to targets of struggle. (2) Cherish the masses' grain and tools, and do not accept compensation from the masses. (3) Pay attention to publicizing the masses and collecting their opinions and feedback on land reform during the assistance process. (4) Pay attention to discovering model figures and units, and commend and reward them at any time. After the instructions were issued, all units responded enthusiastically and turned this instruction into a movement. The directly subordinate team of the university, under the direct influence of the university leaders, showed great enthusiasm. Many comrades participated despite being sick, and some continued working without rest despite having several blisters on their hands. On the first day, they helped the masses cut down sorghum stalks and harvest millet on 57.4 mu, and hauled 20 carts of manure. Currently, the entire university is actively helping. (Jiè Shān)

　　军政大学帮助收秋
    【本报讯】军政大学为了帮助当地群众突击秋收种麦，以便转入复查，全校干部学员在将临毕业的百忙中，抽出三天的时间，全力协同当地群众突击秋收。八月三十日校政治部指示各大队要认真执行这一工作，并规定毕业学生帮助一天，未毕业的学员帮助两天。机关干部事务人员要根据单位情况酌量增加时间，指示中并指出：（一）协同地方干部把对象调查好，保证不浪费劳力，不帮助斗争对象。（二）爱护群众粮食及工具，不要群众报酬。（三）在帮助中注意宣传群众，收集群众对土地改革的意见与反映。（四）注意发现模范人物及单位，随时表扬奖励。指示发出后，各单位热烈的响应，把这一指示造成了运动，校直属队在校首长直接影响下，劲头很大，很多同志带病参加，有的手打了几个泡不休息，第一天便帮助群众割倒高粮槎、收谷子五十七亩四分，拉粪二十车，目前全校正在积极帮助中。（介山）
