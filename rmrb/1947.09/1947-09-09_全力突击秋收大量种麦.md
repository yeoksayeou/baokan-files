　　Go All Out for the Autumn Harvest and Plant Wheat on a Large Scale

　　The White Dew solar term has arrived, and the season for the intense autumn harvest and wheat planting has begun.

　　This year's autumn harvest is the victorious result of the entire region's military and civilians undergoing intense self-defense warfare and land reform, and overcoming disasters such as drought, insects, and hail. From the beginning of spring plowing and sowing to the summer harvest and weeding, we have experienced a complex and arduous process. Some areas have consistently faced heavy war duties; especially in many areas, since spring, the rainfall has been erratic, and sowing has been affected by drought, which has added great difficulties. However, all these difficulties have been overcome under the full mobilization of leading organs at all levels in our region. We have applied and developed organization, achieving the dual goals of participating in the war and production without neglecting either, and victoriously completing spring plowing and sowing, summer harvesting and weeding. Moreover, under the severe threat of drought, we have demonstrated a high degree of organization and tenacity, seizing the opportunity to rush-plant and replant, and overcoming the potentially greater disaster that the weather could have caused. Now that the autumn harvest has arrived, we should attach great importance to this achievement, fully organize a concentrated effort for the autumn harvest, and fully recognize that in many areas this year, the autumn grain harvest is poor, and we should also organize large-scale wheat planting.

　　This year's autumn harvest and wheat planting are taking place as the development of the war situation is approaching a full-scale counter-offensive. Our entire region's military and civilians are using all their strength to prepare for the great counter-offensive, and the autumn harvest and wheat planting are precisely to prepare a solid material foundation for the great counter-offensive. At the same time, the current situation in our region is very complex. Except for areas such as western Shandong, northern Henan, and southern Shanxi, which are still tense war zones, enemies in some marginal areas are preparing to frantically seize grain; many core areas are experiencing disasters and need to expand wheat fields, but harvesting and planting simultaneously will inevitably cause difficulties with labor and animal power; and in some new areas, due to incomplete emancipation, wasteland needs to be eliminated, and there is a lack of experience in organizing. In particular, many areas are seriously threatened by floods. The traitor Chiang Kai-shek once decided to breach the dikes of the Yellow River and Qin River, and we are using huge manpower to protect the dikes and prevent floods. This means that whether it is the autumn harvest or wheat planting, or coping with war, overcoming disasters, and preventing river flooding, whether it is marginal areas or core areas, whether it is old areas or new areas, it will all be very tense and very busy.

　　In order to overcome the above-mentioned difficulties amidst extreme tension and busyness, lay a good material foundation for the great counter-offensive, cherish grain, defend grain, harvest well, store well, and plant wheat on a large scale, this should be the important task of our entire region's military and civilians at present. We should make separate efforts in ideological mobilization and organizational work according to the different requirements of different regions.

　　First of all, in the border areas, we should actively respond to the joint instructions of the Border Region Government and the Military Region to protect the autumn harvest and plant wheat on a large scale, grasp the struggle of dividing fields, rushing the harvest, and protecting grain, combining "dividing fields, dividing the autumn harvest" and "protecting fields, protecting the autumn harvest," that is, combining the autumn harvest war and land reform, and promoting the experience of combining labor and military affairs during the eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan and the struggle of protecting wheat, protecting fields, dividing wheat, and dividing fields during this year's summer harvest. Harvest quickly, store quickly, plant as we harvest, and plant as we store, so as to achieve the dual goals of war, production, and land reform without neglecting any. We should resolutely guard against complacency, raise our fighting spirit, not let the enemy grab a single grain, and starve and trap the enemy to death, so as to ensure the victory of the grain protection struggle.

　　Core areas should fully recognize the importance and urgency of the autumn harvest and wheat planting, continue to rectify mutual aid, organize all labor and animal power, make accurate calculations, arrange appropriately, and mobilize all forces to rush the harvest and planting. New areas, especially disaster areas, must eliminate cultivated wasteland and plant wheat. Experience has shown that during the production season, ignoring the demands of the masses and focusing solely on other work (even if it is very important work), delaying agricultural time will cause unnecessary losses in production. In this tense and busy autumn harvest and wheat planting, we should concentrate our efforts to go deep among the masses to lead and organize, and launch a large-scale autumn harvest and wheat planting movement, truly achieving fast harvesting, fast planting, more cultivation, more planting, and achieving both the autumn harvest and wheat planting without neglecting either. In areas with poor harvests, we should promote the masses' active demands and positive factors for surviving the disaster through production, and through the masses' inspection and calculation, create a conscious and automatic upsurge of planting as we harvest. Ensuring the central link of the autumn harvest and wheat planting is to mobilize auxiliary labor, with men, women, old, and young working together. Past experience has proven that auxiliary labor is a potential and strong force in production labor, and is the source of supply for the labor army. This force should be fully utilized during the autumn harvest. At the same time, the leadership should recognize the difficulties that emancipated masses may encounter in wheat planting, especially in areas with poor harvests, such as the lack of seeds, fertilizers, and animal power, and should earnestly help organize coordination to avoid temporary difficulties that may hinder the completion of the plan. In addition, we should organize technical research, pay attention to intensive cultivation and fine work, and promote wheat planting technology. For example, the masses in Taihang regard the "169" excellent variety as "prosperity wheat" and vigorously promote it; all regions should also attach importance to seed selection.

　　Comrades, leading cadres at all levels, comrades, commanders and fighters of the entire region's troops, comrades of various armed work teams and militia, and all heroes who killed the enemy, heroes who overturned the old order, and labor heroes: We hope that you will add merit to merit, promote the spirit of fighting together with the masses to overcome difficulties in the past, break through all difficulties in the autumn harvest and wheat planting, and ensure the victorious completion of protecting grain, the autumn harvest, and wheat planting. We should clarify ideologically that this victory is inseparable from the victory of the full-scale counter-offensive.

　　全力突击秋收大量种麦
    白露已届，紧张的秋收与种麦的季节已经到来了。
    今年的秋收是全区军民经过紧张的自卫战争与土地改革和战胜旱、虫、雹等灾的胜利成果。自春耕播种开始以至夏收锄苗，都经历了复杂艰苦的过程，有的地区始终战勤繁重；特别在不少地区自春迄夏，雨水失调，下种遇旱，更增加了很大困难。但所有这些困难，在我全区各级领导机关的全力动员下面克服了，运用与发展了组织起来，做到了参战生产两不误，胜利完成了春耕下种、夏收锄苗。而在旱象严重威胁下，更发挥了高度的组织性与顽强性，抓紧了抢种补种，战胜了天时可能造成的更大灾荒。现秋收已届，我们应十分重视这一成果，全力组织突击秋收，并充分认识今年不少地区秋粮歉收，还应组织大量种麦。
    今年的秋收和种麦是处在战局的发展已逼近全面反攻的情况下面，我全区军民正运用一切力量准备大反攻，而秋收种麦正是给大反攻准备雄厚的物质基础。同时我区目前的情况是十分复杂的，除鲁西、豫北、晋南等地仍是紧张的战区外，若干边沿区敌人正在准备疯狂抢粮；不少腹心区存在有灾荒，需要扩大麦田，但收种并进，劳畜力一定要发生困难；而某些新区由于翻身不彻底，荒芜土地需要消灭，又缺乏组织起来的经验；特别是很多地区正遭水灾严重威胁，蒋贼曾决溃黄河、沁河河堤，我正以巨大人力护堤防水。这就是说，要秋收要种麦，又要应付战争，克服灾荒，预防河水泛滥，不论边沿区，腹心区，不论老区新区，将都是十分紧张，十分忙迫的。
    为了克服上述十分紧张繁忙中的困难，给大反攻打下很好的物质基础，爱护粮食，保卫粮食，收好，藏好，大量种麦，应为我全区军民当前的重要任务。并应根据不同地区的不同要求，分别努力思想动员和组织工作。
    首先在边沿区，应积极响应边府及军区保卫秋收大量种麦的联合指示，抓紧分田、抢秋与护粮斗争，把“分田、分秋”、“保田、保秋”结合起来，也就是秋收战争与土地改革结合起来，发扬抗战八年劳武结合与今年夏收中保麦、保田、分麦、分田的斗争经验，快收、快藏，随收、随种，做到战争生产土改三不误。应力戒麻痹，提高斗志，不让敌人抢走一粒粮，饿死和困死敌人，以保证护粮斗争的胜利。
    腹心区应足够认识秋收与种麦的重要性及紧迫性，继续整顿互助，组织所有劳畜力，精确计算，适当的安排，动员一切力量突击收种。新区，尤其是灾区，一定要消灭熟荒，种上麦子。经验证明：在生产季节，不顾群众要求，专忙于其他工作（即便是十分重要的工作），贻误农时，便会造成生产上不应有的损失。在这次紧张繁忙的秋收种麦中，应集中力量深入群众领导组织，掀起一个大规模的秋收种麦运动，真正做到快收、快种、多耕、多种，秋收种麦两不误。歉收地区，应发扬群众生产渡荒的积极要求与积极因素，通过群众的检查计算，造成自觉自动地随收、随种的热潮。保证秋收种麦的中心环节是动员辅助劳力，男女老少一齐动手。历年的经验证明：辅助劳力是生产劳动潜在的雄厚力量，是劳动大军的补给源泉，秋收中更应充分发挥这一力量。同时在领导上应认识翻身群众在种麦中可能遇到的困难，特别是歉收地区，如种子肥料与畜力的缺乏，应认真帮助组织调剂，避免临时困难，妨害计划的完成。此外，应组织技术研究，注意精耕细作，发挥种麦技术，象太行群众把“一六九”优良品种视为“发家麦”大力推行；各地也都应重视选种。
    各级领导干部同志，全区部队指战员同志，各地武工队民兵同志，以及所有杀敌英雄、翻身英雄、劳动英雄们：希望你们功上加功，发扬过去与群众一起斗争克服困难的精神，突破秋收种麦中的一切困难，保证护粮秋收种麦的胜利完成。应在思想上明确起来，这一胜利是与全面反攻的胜利不可分离的。
