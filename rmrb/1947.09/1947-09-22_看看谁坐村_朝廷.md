See Who Sits in the Village "Court"
Ye Feng

I went to the city to deliver a letter,
Passing by Siguo Village in the Second District,
I heard the sound of gongs and drums,
I thought: this must be,
Everyone, after turning over, singing opera,
Or else, it must be:
The brothers are doing well,
Playing music to celebrate a wedding.
× ×
Entering the street and walking forward,
The sound of gongs and drums grew closer,
Looking up, I was shocked:
A person wearing a tattered shirt,
With a stubbly beard half an inch long,
A face the color of eggplant,
Wearing a red rope on his body,
Looking like a criminal,
Look at him, slowly,
Taking one step, hitting the gong,
Taking two steps, sighing,
As if he hadn't eaten enough,
As if suffering pain in his heart...

The drummer followed closely,
Beating vigorously,
Like an official receiving an order,
Shouting loudly:
"His nickname is Chou Ding,
He wants to divide more of the fruits of struggle..."
× ×
The streets were lined with people,
Everyone was discussing,
I was strange, couldn't figure it out,
My feet felt unsteady,
I squeezed inside to listen,
Uncle Goat Beard said:
"Chou Ding is the poorest of the poor,
No house, no land, bare-backed."
Brother Red Eyes said:
"Chou Ding was given three rooms,
The roof has holes that show the stars."
× ×
The militia carrying a rifle,
Patted his chest and said clearly:
"If I were the errand boy,
I wouldn't beat the drum or say a word,
Speaking of it, it's really against my conscience,
All poor people under heaven are one family!"
Uncle Bald Head said:
"I know this matter clearly,
The evaluators discussed for eight whole days,
They put in a lot of effort!?
Today, they decide on this opinion,
Tomorrow, they'll revise and change it again,
Some say: the active in the struggle should get more,
Some say: the cadres should get more for their hard work,
Some say: the middle peasants and poor peasants should divide equally,
Everyone humming and hawing,
Another eight days won't clear things up,
The village chief was furious when he heard,
He opened his mouth and gave an order:
No need to discuss this matter any further,
Whoever gets what should take what,
Whoever says a word will be criticized!
If criticism doesn't work, we'll parade them!!
Look, we've made an example of Chou Ding."
× ×
Grandpa White Hair got anxious,
Shouting angrily:
"The village chief's ears don't work,
He doesn't listen to our poor's reflections,
The village chief has no eyes,
He doesn't see what the poor are like."
× ×
At this time, there was,
A middle-aged man in fine cloth,
Shaking his head and saying clearly:
"Everyone should ask themselves,
The village chief is doing things for us..."
Before he could continue,
Everyone shouted together:
"The village chief is doing things for you!"
"You are a middle peasant, you are happy!"
"Will the fruits of struggle be divided!?"
"We are suffering from hunger and rain!"
I grabbed the crux of the matter and said:
"The poor households suffer more than us,
The fruits should be given to them first."
Everyone said in unison: "That's fair!"
I said: "The middle peasants and poor peasants are one family,
We don't ride horses or sit in sedan chairs,
Everyone must turn over completely,
Turn over and live a good life."
× ×
Everyone was happy to hear this,
I hurried off to deliver the letter.
I left Siguo Village,
Thinking about this matter in my heart,
I decided to go to the city to send a letter,
And tell the county leaders,
To see who sits in the village "court"?
(Note) "Crux" means the key issue in the Yubei people's dialect.

### 看看谁坐村“朝廷”

    看看谁坐村“朝廷”
    叶枫
    我进城里去送信，
    路过二区泗沟村，
    只听锣鼓喧天响，
    我思想：这又是，
    大家翻身唱戏文，
    要不然，一定是：
    哥儿们光景好过了，
    吹吹打打娶新人。
    ×  ×
    进了大街往前行，
    锣鼓声响步步近，
    抬头一看吃一惊：
    一位穿件破衫人，
    圪茬胡子长半寸，
    脸皮茄子一样青，
    身上披条红绳绳，
    好象是个犯罪人，
    你看他，慢吞吞，
    走一步，打下锣，
    走两步，唉一声，
    好似没有吃饱饭，
    好似苦事痛在心。……
    打鼓的紧相跟，
    咚咚咙咙可吃劲
    象位当差接官令，
    直着脖子喊连声：
    “他小名，叫丑丁，
    斗争果实想多分。………”
    ×  ×
    大街两旁站满人，
    一个个议论纷纷，
    我奇怪，闹不清，
    双脚不觉站不稳，
    钻在里边听一听，
    山羊胡伯伯说：
    “丑丁是个最穷的穷人，
    没房没地赤背身。”
    红眼睛哥儿讲：
    “分给丑丁三间房，
    房顶窟窿露星星。”
    ×  ×
    扛着枪杆小民兵，
    拍拍胸膛说得清：
    “要是我当跑腿的，
    不擂鼓也不吭声，
    说起来，真亏心，
    天下穷汉一家人！”
    秃脑瓜叔叔说：
    “这事情，我摸的清，
    评议员评了八天整，
    人家可也费了心！？
    今天，决定这意见，
    明日，重改又换新，
    有的说：斗争积极要多分，
    有的说：干部辛苦应多分，
    有的说：中贫赤农一样分，
    七嘴八舌乱哼哼，
    再开八天也闹不清，
    村长一听气愤愤，
    嘴巴张开下命令：
    这事不用多讨论，
    分给谁啥就要啥，
    谁要吭声叫反省！
    反省不好叫游行！！
    你看制了咱丑丁。”
    ×  ×
    白头爷爷发了急，
    气气呼呼吼连声：
    “村长耳朵不管用，
    不听咱赤贫的反映，
    村长没有长眼睛，
    不看咱赤贫是啥光景。”
    ×  ×
    这时候，有一位，
    穿身细布中年人，
    摇摇脑袋说分明：
    “各人心中要自问，
    村长给咱办事情。……”
    不等他，往下讲，
    大家轰轰说一阵：
    “村长给你办事情！”
    “你是中农心高兴！”
    “斗争果实分不分！？”
    “咱们受饥挨雨淋！”
    抓住圪节我说啦：
    “赤贫户比咱受苦大，
    果实要先尽他们分。”
    大家齐说：“这公平！”
    我说：“中贫赤农是一家，
    骑马坐轿没有咱，
    大家都要翻透身，
    翻身来过好光景。”
    ×  ×
    大家听了都高兴，
    我忙撤腿去送信。
    我走出了泗沟村，
    心中转着这事情，
    决定进城送个信，
    讲给县上领导听，
    看看谁坐村“朝廷”？
    （注）“圪节”即问题关键豫北人民土话。
