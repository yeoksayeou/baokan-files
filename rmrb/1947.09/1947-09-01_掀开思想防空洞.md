This article was originally a special contribution to the "New Masses" monthly magazine, issue 42. It not only provides enlightenment on eradicating landlord ideology during land reform, but also benefits journalists in correcting their stance and investigating "Kremlin air raids." Therefore, we have obtained the consent of the magazine's editor to publish it here in advance. – Editor

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
Since studying the land question, I have realized that there is still a feudal tail in our homes—in many of our troops, institutions, organizations, schools, and all public-operated industrial and commercial departments. This is a strange phenomenon, an extremely contradictory joke. We are leading the revolution, so how can we let the landlord class use us as "air-raid shelters"? We are calling for cutting off the tail, so how can we let the feudal tail hide behind our own backs? The political direction of revolutionary organizations must be unified, and the ideological front must be healthy. This shelter must be dug up, and this tail must be cut off.

The tail first hides in the minds of some people. This manifests as two types of thinking, which can be further distinguished into five kinds of statements:

Some comrades here have reflected relatively well and frankly state that they are standing on the landlord's position. Because their statements are nothing more than the following three:

First, they find reasons for the landlord class, defend them, and exonerate them. For example, they say, "It is a fact that landlords exploit people, but it was legal in that era; they only did something legal, but today it is being liquidated as a crime. Isn't that wrong?" They never think that the masses would say, "It is also legal to struggle against landlords today. We are only doing something legal, so why do you have opinions?" As for whether any peasant ever recognized the landlord's exploitation as "legal" at that time, they don't even think about it. For example, they say that this landlord resisted Japan, that landlord did good deeds; they never say that the landlord resisted Japan while eating rent, while the peasants not only produced rent for them but also resisted Japan ten times more. Nor do they say that a charitable landlord is like a "good robber" who robs you of 100,000 yuan in cash and then gives you five yuan for travel expenses, while the peasants are like the robbed travelers. For example, they are always lowering the family background of one landlord after another, saying that this one can only be considered a "managing landlord," that one can only be considered a rich peasant or even a well-to-do middle peasant; but they never mention that this group of hired laborers has not yet settled down, and that group of poor peasants has not yet eaten their fill. When Zhao Village in Wu'an celebrated the Beginning of Autumn Festival, the cooperative specially slaughtered a pig, planning to let the liberated masses have a good meal; this also aroused their feelings, saying that the landlords of the past dare not even buy half a catty of meat today, which is worthy of sympathy; but a large number of households claiming to be liberated could not even afford four ounces, and they were not surprised at all. In short, they will find reasons for the landlord class, whether it is for the entire landlord class or for a specific landlord, they can always come up with a lot of defense arguments, fully proving that they should not be struggled against. They think hard, argue laboriously, face the landlords, and have no peasants in their eyes. If they were really allowed to speak thoroughly and boldly, the best thing would be to completely abolish the mass liberation movement.

Second, they look for clauses in policies and regulations, fully wanting to use legal means to struggle on behalf of the landlord class. They once pulled out some regulations from the 1930s, once searched through some rules and regulations from the 1940s, as well as what proposals from that year, and what decisions from that time; they can also remember those clauses in the regulations and decisions that are beneficial to the landlords by heart and explain them thoroughly. But they never see that one item or that item that does not care enough for the peasants, thinking it worthy of revision. They always want to find a few of these, to restrict the peasants, protect the landlords, and block the tide of the movement, so that nothing will happen from then on.

Third, they look for shortcomings in the work: they open their eyes and ears to collect the faults in the mass movement; when they collect them, they use them as attack materials, pretending to raise them as questions in a doubtful tone. If someone explains that this is not a fault, they are greatly discouraged; if someone agrees that this is a fault, they publicize it vigorously; if they really seize something wrong, then they openly gloat, saying, "What do you know? Your district and village cadres also have embezzlement! Some of your basic masses also waste the fruits of struggle!" In short, they are experts in attacking the masses and merchants in peddling shortcomings. They do not mention a word about the achievements of the mass movement, because in their eyes, what we call achievements is what they call even greater "heartbreak." They cannot be confused with those who sincerely study and improve the shortcomings of the work. Moreover, they mistakenly believe that we will abandon the mass movement once because of their shouts and mockery, or greatly correct it according to their wishes.

The above is one type. This category has no beautiful name to say, only to be called landlord ideology, based on what they themselves admitted in reflection, that they are standing on the landlord's position. And this ideology is incompatible with the revolution. It is not appropriate to let this kind of thinking hide in our homes, in the minds of some of our family members. Whether it is for the benefit of the revolution or for the progress of these comrades, this tail needs to be cut off. Only by removing these thoughts can the ideology of the revolutionary ranks be pure, and the combat effectiveness of revolutionary organizations can be strengthened; if they always adhere to this kind of thinking, they will not be willing to go with us to fight against feudal forces.

The second type has a different flavor. They claim to be standing on the position of "middle figures," and are also distinguished into two kinds of statements:

One is to say that our mass movement is too "uncivilized", too "crude", and not enough to enter the halls of elegance, such as beating people, even beating people to death, they are "well-intentioned" supporters of the revolution, just afraid of "bad influence", afraid of "middle figures" disliking us for being crude, afraid of scaring away "enlightened gentry". But they are never afraid that the masses will leave us, and never afraid that if we really "civilize" ourselves, the masses will dislike us for being too civilized, and the clumsy carriers of dung buckets will not be able to keep up. They only see that "civilization" is important, and it is terrible that "civilized people" dislike us; but they never see that the masses are the majority, and it is even more terrible that the masses abandon us. According to them, it is best for us to also implement something like "political tutelage", and wait until the "crude people" are trained to be "civilized" before doing anything; or simply not do anything, because once we do it, the "crude people" can only use "crude methods", and they will inevitably shout "It's terrible." As for the question of how the true contrast between this "roughness" and that "civilization" is, they don't even think about it.

The other is some supra-class dreamers who want to realize a "heaven of happiness for all mankind" out of thin air. They say that they follow the revolution because the revolution advocates freedom, fraternity, and equality; because the revolution is building a new society of peace, democracy, and happiness; in short, because the revolution is "beautiful", "pleasing", and has no "uncomfortable" phenomena. But today it is not like this; landlords are being investigated everywhere, feudal tails are being found everywhere, and it is getting deeper and wider, "as if there is no end at all." Everywhere there are bloody battles, pain, trials, and also death; so they, like the two sages of Boyi and Shuqi in ancient times: Their "weak hearts" could not bear it, and they criticized us for "using violence to replace violence," which made them feel that they "could not escape this world of struggle." Their specific proposition is that the revolution should stop at "revolutionizing equality", and now it is "too much"; the revolution should be based on "persuasion", and now it is "too hard". In short, they are the White-Clothed Avalokiteśvara of "compassionate salvation," the Red Cross that does not distinguish between friends and enemies; it is a pity that they were born in the wrong world, could not find the true Buddha and Jesus, but came to join the Marxist-Leninist party. This is generally called "humanitarianism" or "compassionate viewpoint", but in reality, it is precisely the objective ally of the landlord class and a major obstacle to the mass movement. Regarding the liquidation of this kind of thinking, we cannot say much at once. For this reason, we have specially reprinted the book "Liberated Don Quixote" translated by Comrade Qu Qiubai. In that book, Don Quixote, who is even more of an "incarnation of compassion and justice" than these comrades, ended up participating in a counter-revolutionary prison break conspiracy based on his "compassion and justice" and doing a "compassionate cause" that sabotaged the revolution! Balatasa, the revolutionary intellectual who was truly transformed, was moved by Don Quixote's "compassion and justice" because of a soft heart, and as a result, caused endless sins for the revolution, killing tens of thousands more people. After this book is printed, I hope that every comrade will take a look at it as soon as possible and truly evaluate the so-called "humanitarianism" and "compassionate viewpoint" - not to evaluate how much their "compassion and justice" are worth, but to estimate how many "crude people" this set of things will "compassion" and how much revolutionary cause will be "justice".

But no matter what, the above two kinds of arguments, whether of the same type or different factions, are ultimately performing the task of the "air-raid shelter" for the feudal tail. This must also be clarified quickly. We cannot continue to let these comrades always complain "it's terrible," nor can we wait for these "good people" to "compassionate" out some terrible "achievements" before saying anything.

In addition to these "dark caves" and tails in thought, there is also the concrete work of hiding the objects of struggle and sheltering landlord's materials. They probably also divide this into several steps:

The first step is to try to "rescue" the entire landlord class, and all the above-mentioned "theories" are for this purpose. But this will not work, because the masses have not stopped because of these moans or loud appeals.

So the second step is to try to "rescue" their own families. We don't actually object to rescuing, as long as these comrades take the revolutionary path of transforming the old family into a new family, but they don't, they never think of doing this. They only think of escaping when the time comes, wanting his plan to make his landlord family stand alone when the entire landlord class should collapse; or to easily win the name of "enlightened" and become a respected figure without going through the rough hands and feet of the masses. However, this is generally useless, and the masses are comfortable with "crude and clumsy" and do not accept those clever plans.

So the third step is to try to move those who have been struggled against into the organs, calling them family members, and asking for care. This has become a practical problem here. But this is absolutely impossible. We are not a reception center for the objects of struggle at all, not to mention that. The important thing is that the masses have prescribed good ways out for the entire landlord class; if there are no prescribed ones, we can help the masses to prescribe them; but we can never find a different way of life for a certain landlord outside the mass line, or even live more comfortably than others.

At the same time, there is a fourth step, that is, to tamper with things, steal and leak gold and silver treasures, secretly pack up, hang on to their legs, and never want to move forward.

Naturally, these specific things must also be handled specifically. But in the end, we must also explain one point: we are conducting the study of the land question, which means that all of us who participate in the study basically do not oppose land reform; therefore, what we have talked about for a long time about "digging holes and cutting tails" is also said in the attitude of our own family; and the focus is on transforming the thinking of these comrades. If the thinking is transformed, the actions are changed, the position is changed, and the family members and treasures are sent away, then there is no problem, the study is considered successful, and we do not want to simply expel a few people and cut off the path of advancement for any comrade. As for those guys who are the objects of struggle who are themselves sinful, everything said here does not apply to them, so let them go, and it has nothing to do with what is discussed in this article.

### 掀开思想防空洞

　　掀开思想防空洞
    王春
    此文原系“新大众”月刊第四十二期特约稿，不仅对于土改中肃清地主思想有所启发，即对于新闻工作者端正立场，清查“克里空”亦有所裨益，故特商得该刊编辑同意，提前发表于此。　　　　　　　　——编者
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    学习土地问题以来，知道还有一段封建尾巴插在我们家里——在我们的许多部队、机关、团体、学校及一切公营工商事业部门里。这是怪现象，这是极端矛盾的笑话。我们领导革命，怎么又让地主阶级把我们当作“防空洞”？我们号召割掉尾巴，怎么又让封建尾巴藏在我们自己的脊背后？革命组织的政治方向必须统一，思想阵线必须健康。此洞必须掘，此尾巴必须割。
    尾巴首先藏在一些人们的头脑里。这表现为两类思想，而又可区别为五种言论：
    我们这里有几个反省较好的同志，率直说出他们站的是地主立场。因为他们的言论，不外下列三种：
    一是替地主阶级找理由，替他们辩护，开脱。譬如他们是这么说：“地主剥削人是事实，但这在那个时代是合法的；人家不过做了点合法的事情，今天却当作罪恶来清算，岂非不应该？”他们却从没想到群众会这么说：“今天斗争地主也是合法的，我们不过做了点合法的事情，那为什么你偏要有些意见呢？”至于就是在那个时候，有那一个农民曾经承认过地主的剥削“合法”，这他们更不去想了。又譬如他们说：这个地主抗日，那个地主行善；他们却从不说地主是吃着租子抗日，而农民却是又替他们生产租子又比他多抗了十倍的日，他们也不说行善的地主正象劫了你十万元现金再发给你五块钱路费的“好强盗”一样，而农民却正做了那个被劫的旅客。又譬如他们总在替一个一个地主降低家庭成分，说这个只能算“经营地主”，那个只能算富农乃至富裕中农；却从不见他们说这一批雇农还没有安住家，那一群贫农还没有吃饱饭。武安赵庄过立秋节的时候，合作社特为杀了一口猪，打算叫翻身的群众吃上一顿好饭；这也引起他们的观感来了，说过去的地主今天连半斤肉也不敢买了，可见值得同情；但是还有一大批号称翻身之户却连四两也没有能够买得起，他们竟并未大吃一惊。总而言之，他们是会替地主阶级找理由的，无论是就整个地主阶级来说，无论是就那一个具体的地主来说，他们总都能说出一大堆辩诉词，充分证明是不该斗争的。他们思索劳神，论证费力，面向地主，目无农民。要真让他们彻底大胆讲论的话，那就最好是根本取消群众翻身运动。
    二是向政策法令找条文，充分想替地主阶级运用合法斗争的手段。他们曾经搬出过一九三几年的什么条例，曾经翻查过一九四几年的什么章则，还有那一年的什么什么议案，那一次的什么什么决定；他们还能把那些条例决定上头有利于地主的词句记得烂熟，讲得精透。但他们就从不曾看到那一条那一项有些关照农民不够的地方，认为值得修正。他们总想找到这么几条，把农民限制住，把地主保障住，把运动的潮水一闸闸死，从此没事。
    三是找寻工作的缺点：他们洗了眼睛耳朵在搜集群众运动中的毛病；搜集到了，作为攻击的资料，假装着用怀疑的口吻作为问题提出来。有人说明了这不是毛病，他大为泄气；有人同意了说这就是毛病，他大肆宣传；真要是被他抓住了什么毛病，那就公然幸灾乐祸一番，说“怎么样？你们那些区村干部也有的贪污吧！你们那些基本群众也有人浪费斗争果实吧！”总之，他们是攻击群众的专门家，是搬弄缺点的杂货商。他们对于群众运动的成绩，一字不提，因为在他们看起来，我们所谓成绩，就是他们所谓更大的“伤心之事”。他们和诚心诚意研究改进工作缺点的人完全不能混为一谈。他们并且误以为我们会因他们的这些叫唤、讥笑而一旦放弃群众运动不干，或者大大的照他们的意思纠正一番。
    以上是一类。这一类别无美丽名称可说，只能照他们自己在反省中承认了的，站的是地主立场，唤它做地主思想。而这思想是和革命不相容的。让这种思想藏在我们家里，藏在我们家的一些人的头脑里，这不妥。不管是对于革命的利益来说，对于这些同志的进步来说，这段尾巴都需要割。把这些思想割除出去，革命队伍的思想才能纯洁，革命组织的战斗力才能加强；他们要是一直坚持着这种思想，是不肯和我们一道去向封建势力作战的。
    第二类另是一种味道，他们自称已站的“中间人士”的立场，又区别为两种言论：
    一种是说我们的群众运动的方式太“不文明”，太“粗”，太不足以登大雅之堂，譬如说打人，甚至于打死人，他们是“好心好意”拥护革命的人，就是怕“影响不好”，怕“中间人士”嫌弃咱粗野，怕吓跑了“开明士绅”。但是他们却从不怕群众离开了咱，从不怕咱真要“文明”起来，群众也会嫌弃咱太文明，弄得粗手笨脚的担粪桶们追随不上。他们只看见“文明”是重要的，“文明人”嫌弃起咱来是可怕的；却从看不见群众是占多数的，群众丢下了咱是越发可怕的。照他们说来，那咱最好也是实行什么“训政”之类，等到把“粗人”训“文明”了再干；或者是根本就不用干，因为一干起来，“粗人”总只能使用“粗法”，还是免不了他们要叫唤“糟得很”。至于这“粗暴”与那“文明”的真正对比程度到底怎样等问题，在他们更是想也不去想的了。
    一种是一些超阶级的想凭空实现“全人类幸福天堂”的梦幻家。他们说他们之所以追随革命，是因为革命是提倡自由、博爱平等的；是因为革命是建设和平、民主、幸福的新社会的；总而言之，是因为革命是“美”的，是“叫人愉快”的，是没有“不舒服”的现象的。然而今天却不是这样；到处追究地主，到处找封建尾巴，而且越来越深越广，“好象根本就没有个完”。到处有血肉的搏战，有痛苦，有审判，也有死亡；于是他们象古时的伯夷、叔齐两圣贤一样：“稚弱的心灵”受不住了，批评我们是“以暴易暴”，叫他感到“没法逃开这斗争的人世”。他们的具体主张是革命以“革平”为止，而现在则“太过”；革命以“劝说”为主，而现在则“太硬”。要之，他们是“慈航普渡”的白衣大士，是不分敌友的红十字会；就可惜他们错生了世界，找不着真正的释迦、耶稣、却来投奔了马列主义的政党。这一般说来叫做“人道主义”或“怜悯观点”，而实实在在却正也是地主阶级客观上的同盟军，是群众运动的大阻力。关于清算这种思想，一时是不能说得很多的。为此，我们特别翻印了瞿秋白同志译的“解放了的董·吉诃德”这本书。在那本书上，那位比这些同志更是“慈悲正义的化身”的董·吉诃德，结果是根据他的“慈悲正义”参加了反革命的越狱阴谋，做了破坏革命的“慈悲事业”！那位真正改造过了的革命智识分子巴拉塔萨，由于一个软心，被董·吉诃德的“慈悲正义”所感动，结果替革命造下了无穷罪孽，多死了几十万人。这本书印出后，希望每个同志赶紧看一下，把那种所谓“人道主义”“怜悯观点”等等，切实估价一番——倒还不是估价他们的“慈悲正义”值多少，而是须得估计这一套东西会“慈悲”掉多少“粗人”的性命，会“正义”掉多少革命的事业。
    但是不管怎么说，以上这同类型异派别的两种论调，总归都也是担任着封建尾巴的“防空洞”的任务的。这也必须赶快澄清。我们不能一直让这些同志们老嫌“糟得很”，也不能等这些“好心人”“慈悲”出什么可怕的“成绩”来再说。
    除开思想上这些“暗洞”和尾巴。就是具体的在做掩藏斗争对象和掩护地主物资的工作。这他们大概也分着几个步骤：
    第一步是设法“抢救”整个地主阶级，上述“理论”种种就都是为此。然而这不行，因为群众并未因这些唧唧哼哼或是大声疾呼而歇手不干。
    于是第二步便设法“抢救”自己的家庭。抢救，我们其实也并不反对，只要这些同志们采取是革命的改造旧家庭为新家庭的道路，然而他们不是，他们从来也不想这么作。他们只是事到临头才想法逃脱，想因他的计策而使他为地主家庭在整个地主阶级该塌台的时候巍然独存；或是独免于经过群众的粗拳笨脚之手，而轻易博个“开明”之名，还做被尊重的人物。不过这也大体都没有用上，群众安于“粗笨”，竟不去接受那些巧妙方案。
    于是第三步便是设法把那些斗争过的人搬到机关里来，名之曰家属，还要叫照顾。这在我们这里已成了现实问题。然而这恰恰又是绝对不行的。我们根本就不是斗争对象的收容所，这还不提。要紧的是群众替整个地主阶级有规定好了的出路；没有规定好的，我们还可以帮群众去规定；我们却断断不能在群众路线以外，另外给某个地主找寻一种与众不同的什么生活方法，甚至是生活得比旁人都舒服。
    并行不悖的还有第四步，那就是捣腾点东西，偷漏些金银财宝，暗暗卷包，挂住自己的腿，死也再不想前进一步。
    对于以上这些具体事情，自然也都得具体处理。不过临了我们还得说明一点：我们是在进行土地问题的学习，这就是说凡是我们参加学习的这批人，基本上都算是不反对土地改革的；所以我们谈了半天的“刨洞割尾巴”的话，也是用对自家人的态度来说的；而所侧重的，则是改造这些同志们的思想。思想改造了，行动改变了，转换了立场，送走了家眷和财宝，就是没问题的同志，学习就算成功，我们并不想简简单单革除几个人出去，断绝那一个同志的上进之路。至于那些本人就是罪恶的斗争对象的家伙们，连这些说的一切都谈不上，就让他去好了，与此文所谈不干。
