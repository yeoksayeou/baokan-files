　　Cadres in Organs Directly Under the Border Region Study Land Reform
  　Cadres' Ideology Takes a Step Forward
    Chairman Yang Calls on Everyone to Thoroughly Transform Their Thinking
    [Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] Cadres in the organs directly under the Border Region Government began a study movement of checking fields, checking class status, and checking ideology from mid-June. All workers and miscellaneous staff in each unit were involved in this study movement. Chairman Yang Rong personally took action to guide it. At the beginning, everyone thought, "I very much agree with land reform and there is no problem." Those whose families were struggled against also said that their thinking had been straightened out long ago and they had no objections. Some comrades who were far from home even felt that they had nothing to do with land reform, and it didn't matter whether they were struggled against or not, and there were no problems. After a week of such discussions, most people only studied in terms of principles and theories, and could not relate it to themselves. Later, some groups created the method of "sharing family matters," adopting an open approach where each person reported their family's economic situation and personal background, the situation of their family being struggled against, and their own views, thoughts, and expressions. Class status was checked during the sharing of family matters. Some traced back to three generations of ancestors, and the enthusiasm for study soared. Some who previously thought they were middle peasants now re-examined themselves and found they were rich peasants. Some who thought they were rich peasants were found to be landlords. Some even thought they were well-to-do middle peasants, but were first found to be rich peasants, and finally found to be managing landlords. After two weeks of sharing family matters, the Study Committee, in order to further improve, proposed in early July to deeply examine ideology and actions, so as to achieve ideological awareness in every comrade. During this period, most comrades examined themselves in a relatively detailed and in-depth manner, but another group of comrades disagreed with checking actions. They believed that this would only lead to an examination of comrades whose families were being struggled against. Some were afraid of revealing their landlord tails during the study. Some outside cadres considered themselves "floating elements" and found it difficult to examine themselves thoroughly. Some reflected halfway and gave up, or did not admit to being landlords. These thoughts hindered the deepening of the movement. In response to this situation, in order to open up everyone's thinking, the Study Committee organized another typical demonstration report meeting, where a comrade with landlord status and a comrade with middle peasant status gave demonstration reports of self-reflection. Chairman Yang personally mobilized everyone, pointing out that the purpose of land reform study was to transform thinking and eliminate landlord class consciousness. Therefore, he called on everyone to have a serious attitude towards study, sincerely help each other, develop free thinking, boldly expose themselves, and seek solutions one by one in order to gradually improve themselves. After this meeting, the enthusiasm for study in various units became even higher. After listening to the report, one comrade from the ×× unit re-examined his own history and exposed things he had never said before. Comrades from middle peasant backgrounds who previously thought they had no problems now felt that they also had problems. Struggle targets were found among the workers in the ×× unit, and their "revenge" thinking was also found. Li Pin-san's niece, a big traitor from Wu'an, who was hiding in the ×× unit, was also found. In the ×× unit, it was reflected that some people had kept burdens for the struggle targets stationed in the village; some had used other people's names to write letters to local governments to arrange for their landlord families to escape, and demanded the distribution of struggle fruits; some had built air-raid shelters for landlords because they had married the landlord's daughter. During the complaints of the miscellaneous personnel of the Border Region Government, it was also found that a vicious landlord was selling drugs. This stage continued for more than a month, and many comrades had begun to clarify their positions. However, some comrades still emphasized that their families were enlightened and that they had made contributions to the anti-Japanese war and should be taken care of; or they felt that some "hooligans" and those who had been "puppet soldiers" in the past were also struggling against their families, and they could not understand this ideologically. Some used the phrase "deviations in the mass movement are inevitable," and therefore believed that their families should not be struggled against, so those who were struggled against were deviations in the movement; some raised the question of whether the masses could not be mobilized if their families were not struggled against? Or whether the masses could not be mobilized if their father was not beaten to death, etc. After clarifying the essence of exploitation, that landlords were all bloodsuckers, distinguishing between landlord thinking and proletarian thinking, and exposing the crimes of their families' past rule and oppression of the masses, the statements such as "enlightened," "take care of," "deviations," "hooligans," and "should not divide their family's property" were all resolved.

    However, because the development of free thinking in the movement was not enough, and the self-reflection and opinions of other comrades emphasized hard criticism and "chasing after ideology," the method of enlightening and guiding, scientifically researching and exploring, and then clarifying the truth was not used enough, so some comrades had ideological concerns and did not dare to boldly and thoroughly expose their thoughts. Therefore, in the most recent period, a phenomenon of stagnation has appeared in the study. In order to thoroughly implement the study policy of transforming ideology, Chairman Yang made another enlightening report on thoroughly implementing land reform study and transforming ideology at the Border Region cadres' conference on August 24. He called on every comrade to thoroughly and deeply transform their own thinking and change their own stand in order to wholeheartedly serve the people as a good long-term worker for the masses. He also pointed out that some comrades had not participated in land reform in the past and had not been tempered by the mass movement, and they should make up for this shortcoming in the study. If you do not transform your thinking well and cannot serve the people wholeheartedly, then the masses will not approve of you. Chairman Yang continued to point out: Now all regions are actively preparing for a major counter-offensive, and the front line is engaged in tense and arduous combat, while we in the rear have heard that some comrades are still making a lot of trouble, making demands, creating disunity, and making trouble with cadre relations. This is very inconsistent with the situation on the front line and should be reflected upon and reviewed. When the self-defense war began last year, discipline was emphasized, which made many cadres obey the opinions of the masses and implement the interests of the masses, greatly improving the mass viewpoint and mass line. Now we must still emphasize organizational discipline, and all important systems must be maintained and implemented, and cannot be messed with, arbitrarily ignored, or destroyed. Some comrades think that making trouble is their "privilege," which should be eliminated in today's tense struggle. Now war and land reform are so important, and the scale of the mass movement is so large. If you cannot see these things, and only see your own small circle and forget the demands of the masses, this is a degenerate thought and must not be allowed. Therefore, everyone must conduct land reform study well and improve their work.

    According to Chairman Yang's report and the previous stage of study, the Study Committee decided to re-launch free thinking, boldly let go, and say whatever you want, so that ideological problems can be solved consciously. This movement is now developing in depth.

　　边直各机关学习土地改革
  　干部思想提高一步
    杨主席号召大家彻底改造思想
    【本报特讯】边府直属各机关干部从六月中旬起，即开始了查田、查阶级、查思想的学习运动，各单位工杂人员全部卷入这一学习运动中。杨戎主席更亲自动手，进行指导。开始时，大家都认为“自己很同意土地改革，没啥问题。”家庭被斗争的，也说思想早打通了，没有意见；有些离家远的同志，更认为自己与土地改革无关，斗不斗都没关系，也没问题。这样讨论了一星期，大都只在原则理论上研究，联系不上自己。以后有的小组创造出“摆家常”的方法，采取开门见山，各人报告家庭经济情况与个人出身历史，家庭被斗争的情形自己的看法想法和表现。在摆家常中进行查阶级，有的追根到祖宗三代，学习情绪顿形高涨。过去有的认为自己是中农的，现在重新检查出是个富农，认为是富农的，查出是地主，甚至有的认为是富裕中农的，第一次查出是富农，最后又查出是经营地主。摆家常进行了两个星期，学习委员会为了更提高一步，又于七月初提出深入查思想查行动，以达到每个同志的思想自觉。这一期间，大部同志检查得比较细致深入，但另一部分同志却不同意查行动。他们认为这只能形成对几个家庭被斗的同志的检查；也有害怕在学习中检查出自己地主尾巴的；有的外来干部则自认是“游离分子”，不好检查，深入不下去；有的反省一半，中途而废，或者不承认是地主。这些思想都阻碍着运动的深入。根据这一情况，为打开大家思想，学委会又组织了一次典型示范报告会，由一个地主成份与一个中农成份的同志作了反省示范报告。杨主席又亲自进行动员，指出土地改革学习的目的，是改造思想，肃清地主阶级意识，因此号召大家要严肃学习态度，互相诚恳帮助，开展自由思想，大胆暴露自己，一一求得解决，才能逐步提高自己。这次会议后，各单位学习情绪更加高涨。××单位一位同志听了报告后，重新反省自己历史，把过去都未说过的事情暴露了出来；原来认为自己无问题的中农出身同志，现在觉得自己也有问题了。××单位工人中检查出斗争对象，也检查出他们的“报仇”思想，××单位中隐藏着的武安大汉奸李品三的侄媳，也被检查出来。××单位中反省出有为驻村斗争对象保存的包袱；有私用别我名义向地方政府写信以安插自己逃避出来地主家庭，并要求分配斗争果实；也有因为娶了地主女儿，以致为地主作了防空洞。边府杂务人员诉苦中，还查出了贩卖毒品的恶毒的地主。这一阶段继续了一个多月，许多同志已开始明确了立场。但还有部分同志强调自己家庭开明，强调自己抗日有功，应该照顾；或者认为有些“流氓”及过去当过“伪军的”也来斗争自己家庭，思想上想不通；有的则利用“群众运动中偏向不可避免”的一句话，因而认为自己家庭不该被斗争，所以被斗争者乃是运动中的偏向；有的提出是否不斗争我家就发动不了群众？或者不打死我父亲就发动不了群众等等问题。当在明确了剥削的本质，地主都是吸血鬼，分清地主思想与无产阶级思想，暴露出自己家庭过去统治压迫群众的罪恶之后，什么“开明”、“照顾”、“偏向”、“流氓”、“不应分自己家庭的财产”等说法就跟着解决了。
    但是由于在运动中开展自由思想还不够，自我反省与别的同志提意见着重了硬的批判与“追思想”的方式，对启发诱导，科学研究探讨然后达到辩明真理的方法运用不够，因此使有些同志思想上存在着顾虑，不敢大胆净尽的暴露思想。因此在最近一个时期，学习上又表现了一种迟滞的现象。为了彻底贯彻改造思想的学习方针，杨主席于八月二十四日又专在边直干部大会上作了一次贯彻土地改革学习，改造思想的启发报告，号召每个同志要彻底深入改造自己的思想，改变自己的立场，以达到全心全意为人民服务作群众一个好长工。并指出有些同志过去未能参加土改，未受群众运动锻炼，现在应当在学习中来补救这一缺陷。如不好好改造思想，不能全心全意为人民服务，那么群众是不会批准你的。杨主席继续指出：现在各地正积极准备大反攻，前方正紧张艰苦的作战，而我们在后方的，听说有些同志还在大闹情绪，闹要求，闹不团结，闹干部关系，这是和前方情况很不谐和的，是应当反省检讨的。去年自卫战争开始时，曾强调提出过纪律，使许多干部服从了群众意见，执行群众利益，大大提高了群众观点与群众路线。现在我们仍须强调组织纪律，一切重要制度必须维护执行，不能乱来，任意忽视破坏。有些同志认为闹意见是自己的“特权”在今天这样紧张的斗争中应当予以清除。现在战争、土改如此重要，群运规模如此宏大，如看不到这些，只看到自己的小圈子，忘了群众要求，这是蜕化思想，是要不得的，因此大家必须好好进行土改学习，并把工作提高。
    学习委员会根据杨主席的报告，与前一段的学习情况，决定重新开展自由思想，大胆放手，有啥说啥，这样才能自觉的解决思想问题。现这一运动正深入开展。
