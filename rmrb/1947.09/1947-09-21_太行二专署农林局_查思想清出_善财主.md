    Taihang Second Special District Agricultural and Forestry Bureau
    Investigates Ideology and Clears Out "Benevolent Landlord"
    The Second Special District Agricultural and Forestry Bureau squeezed out the "benevolent landlord" Zhao Huaiqian and Hao Jinyu, Zhao Quanheng, and other three people. Zhao Huaiqian was a big landlord from Sipu Temple, Zuoquan. During the land reform, he played tricks, pretended to be enlightened, and offered all his property, so he was not struggled against by the masses. However, he hid all his belongings. Last year, he sneaked into the Agricultural and Forestry Bureau to work. His father became a teacher at Zuoquan Second High School (and his wife is the daughter of the big landlord Cao family in Xiguan). From then on, he stayed far away from the sight of mass struggle and burrowed into a safe haven. Last spring, he kept 200,000 Jichaos in custody for his father-in-law (the Cao family in Xiguan). Because he was cunning and slippery, he confused some of the masses, who called him a "benevolent landlord." Zhao colluded with backward elements in the Rural Affairs Bureau, attacked and ridiculed activists, seized upon the weaknesses of the leadership, and deliberately exaggerated and spread destruction. This time, during the investigation of ideology and class, the truth was revealed. Hao Jinyu is from Changcheng, Zuoquan. Before the war, he worked for 16 years taking photos in churches in Shanghai, Peiping, and Taiyuan. Last spring, dissatisfied with the masses' liquidation of his bully landlord problem, he sneaked into the organization as a production worker. Zhao Quanheng, during this land reform study, did not change his landlord stance at all. Everyone said: "Let them all get out!"
          (Li Fenglin, Li Qin)
    [Our newspaper's Shouyang dispatch] The entire teaching staff of this county, during the training period, carried out "investigating class," "investigating ideology," "squeezing out feudalism," and "squeezing out traitors and spies." It started on September 3rd and ended on the 10th. Four traitors and spies, including Hao Pimo, were squeezed out. Nine feudal landlords, including Pang Dejin, were squeezed out, and two ingots of silver (fifty taels each), one gold ring, one tael of opium, one watch, more than three hundred silver dollars, clothes, grain, and many other items were seized and immediately handed over to the masses for disposal. Through "clarifying ideology," "drawing clear lines," and "defining class," many feudal ideas, old work styles, arrogance, seniority, disregard for organization, dissatisfaction with land reform, retaliation against peasants, compromise and capitulation, monkism, hooliganism, corruption, and hedonistic thinking were discovered. After everyone's ideological awakening and mutual assistance, everyone finally understood that with these old feudal ideas existing, educational work could never be done well.

    太行二专署农林局
    查思想清出“善财主”
    二专农林局，挤出了“善财主”赵怀谦及郝晋瑜、赵权衡等三人。赵怀谦左权寺坪大地主。土地改革中，耍手腕、装开明，将全部财产献出，未被群众斗争，却隐藏了全部内物，去年混入农林局工作，他父亲到左权二高当教员，（老婆又是西关大地主曹家女儿）从此，远远躲开群众斗争视线，钻进了保险洞。去年春，给其岳父（西关曹家）保管冀钞二十万元，因为他诡诈、滑头，迷糊了一些群众，称他为：“善财主”，赵在农村局拉拢落后，打击讥讽积极分子，抓住领导弱点，有意夸大，宣传破坏。这次在查思想、查阶级中，露出了真相。郝晋玉，左权长城人，战前，与教会在上海北平、太原照相十六年。去年春不满群众清算他的恶霸问题，混入机关当生产员。赵权衡此次土改学习中，毫不改变地主立场，大家说：“让他们一齐滚蛋”。          
          （李枫林、李沁）
    【本报寿阳讯】本县全体教员，在集训期间，进行了“查阶级”“查思想”“挤封建”“挤奸特。”于九月三号开始，十号止。挤出了奸特郝丕模等四人。挤出封建地主庞得金等九人，并搞出元宝两个（每个五十两），金戒指一个，鸦片一两，手表一个，白洋三百余元，衣服粮食及其它甚多，并即交与群众处理。“查清思想”、“划清界线”、“明确阶级”，查出了不少的封建思想、旧的作风、自高自大、摆老资格、目无组织、对土地改革不满、向农民报复、妥协投降、和尚主义、流氓腐化、享乐思想等，经大家思想自觉，互相帮助，最后大家明确，有此种旧的封建思想存在，教育工作决不能搞好。（正衡、俊生、鹏飞、立三）
