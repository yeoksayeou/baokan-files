    Zhao Zhuang Military Dependents Write Letters to Their Sons and Brothers, Celebrating Their Meritorious Service in the Southern Campaign
    [This Newspaper's Dispatch] After the news of the People's Liberation Army's full-scale counter-offensive and the victory of Liu and Deng's army sweeping across the Yangtze River against Chiang Kai-shek's bandits reached Zhao Zhuang in Wu'an, the military dependents throughout the village were extremely excited. They wrote letters to the People's Daily and Handan Radio Station, requesting that the letters be quickly forwarded to their husbands, brothers, and sons who were on the Southern Campaign. A virtuous wife, Jin Di, wrote to her husband, Jin Jinke, with great pride, saying: "In February of this year, we already bought a piece of land. The village also exchanged two good houses for us. Our land in Yangshugang has also been exchanged for the good land of the landlord Ju Zi in Xigou. A few days ago, when the fruits of the liberation were distributed, the village gave us preferential treatment with three mu of land, plus two fen of irrigated land and 30,000 yuan. Now our family has ten mu of land. The irrigated land is cultivated by ourselves, and the rest is cultivated by the village on our behalf. Your Kui and I are both doing well. Kui is studying at the village school every day and already understands 'Chairman Mao is the savior, and Chiang Kai-shek is the root of all evil.' When he comes back from school, he jumps around and helps me cook. He fully understands why you left home (to uproot Chiang). Don't worry about anything, just focus on fighting Chiang's bandits outside!" Zhang Yun wrote to her husband, Jin Wutang: "Dearest Husband: You have performed great services for the people in the months since crossing the river, and I feel very honored. The autumn harvest is coming soon at home. This autumn, our family's harvest is expected to be 80% to 90%, yielding seven or eight shi of grain. After deducting food and clothing expenses, there will be several shi left over. Our family's land is cultivated by Yang Tiancai, Yang Fuyi, Kong Quanxi, and Yang Shuanyi, who are honest and reliable people, as you know. There is no need to worry about any work. Yang Changcun fetches water for us every day, and the village carries coal for us, so there are no difficulties at all. Your Zengke can already smile and call 'Mama.' Guozi came back from school today and wants to compete with you: she studies, you kill the enemy, and after Chiang Kai-shek is defeated, the whole family will come together to summarize and evaluate." The young wife of soldier Yang Caisheng, Yang Xiangting, reported good news to her husband: "You have reached the Yangtze River, and the villagers are congratulating you. I want to report good news to you. In April of this year, your little daughter was born. The villagers all say that she looks like her mother and has her father's eyes. Don't miss home, just intensify the fight against Chiang's bandits. When you return victoriously, your little daughter will call you 'Daddy.'" Zhao Hengyi wrote to his son Zhao Wang, who was on the expedition: "My son, be informed: Your father is healthy, and the whole family is safe, so don't worry. I hope my son understands the great cause, advances bravely, and annihilates Chiang's bandits in one breath. After the victory, return home gloriously and reunite with your family to enjoy the joys of family life." A young brother wrote to his brother Jin Donglin, who was on the Southern Campaign: "Our family has been allocated five mu of land, 30,000 yuan, and a mule. Life is not difficult at all. Brother! You are expanding the liberated areas on the front line, and this autumn I will expand wheat planting in the rear to fully support you. Last year, our family planted four mu of wheat, and this autumn our family will increase it to seven mu."
    There were also many other letters from mothers to their children, brothers to brothers, and mothers-in-law to sons-in-law, all filled with encouragement and excitement, and eagerly hoping that they would bravely kill the enemy and return to reunite as soon as possible.
    [This Newspaper's Dispatch] After the news of the People's Liberation Army's large-scale counter-offensive reached Sanwang Village on the evening of the 15th, the masses throughout the village were extremely happy and said, "Chiang Kai-shek is about to be finished, and the world is ours." At that time, the district was arranging to raise public funds, which were to be completed on the 17th. The masses of Sanwang Village handed in all 210,000 yuan on the morning of the 16th. When handing in the money, everyone also said: "Taking time to dig canals for one day per person will earn back this 210,000 yuan." After the women heard this news, they spun cotton with even more energy at night. Everyone in the village was beaming with joy, and the children were helping the military dependents carry water and collect firewood busily. People like Wang Shuanhe are now preparing to write letters to the front line on behalf of the families of revolutionary martyrs, urging the soldiers to focus on fighting old Chiang. Liberated peasants Wang Zengjin and Zengyu said, "The fighting on the front line is energetic, and our production is even more energetic. We dare to guarantee that the army will not have any difficulties with food, clothing, and pocket money." (Geng)
