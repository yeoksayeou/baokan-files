    Trade Union Communication Group

  　I. Market Conditions and Prices:
    Grains: Grain prices in the border region generally declined steadily. Taihang and Taiyue experienced a sharp rise in late July and early August due to drought: In Jin(cheng), Chang(zhi), She(xian) and other places, millet reached 170 yuan per jin (斤 - approx. 500g). After widespread rain, grain prices in various places gradually decreased. From the 14th to the 18th in Jincheng, millet dropped from 119 yuan to 87-85 yuan, wheat from 120 yuan to 110 yuan, and corn from 90 yuan to 55 yuan. On the 27th, the price of millet remained unchanged, while wheat fell to 86 yuan. In Changzhi, on the 10th, millet was 100 yuan per jin, wheat was 114 yuan, and corn was 57 yuan; on the 27th, millet was 81 yuan, wheat was 86 yuan, and corn was 52 yuan, with each grain decreasing by half compared to the end of July. In Shexian, from the 3rd to the 25th, millet decreased from 130 yuan to 100 yuan; wheat from 127 yuan to 106 yuan; and corn from 123 yuan to 70 yuan. After the 17th in Yangyi, also affected by price drops in other areas, prices decreased: millet from 145-160 yuan to 110-130 yuan; corn from 110 yuan to 95-90 yuan; wheat remained at 125 yuan, unchanged on the 27th. In the northern counties of Lincheng in the Taihang First District, such as Gaoyi, Zan, Yuan, and Jing, grain prices were particularly high before the 20th due to late rainfall. After rainfall on the 23rd, grain prices continued to decline. Gaoyi initially turned back, with millet at 4200 yuan, wheat at 3900 yuan, and corn at 2900 yuan, each grain decreasing by 300-400 yuan per big dou (大斗 - a unit of volume). Xingtai experienced a rise after an initial drop: in the first ten days of the month, millet was 119 yuan per jin, corn was 94 yuan, and black beans were 114 yuan, with each grain dropping by about 15 yuan; from the 14th to the 25th, due to rain and less grain entering the market, prices rose: millet was exceptionally high at 150 yuan per jin, wheat at 134 yuan, and corn at 116 yuan. As the source of grain in Handan continued to increase, in addition to the continued arrival of eastern grain, miscellaneous grains from Quzhou, Weixian, and other places also came in large quantities from the 12th to the 20th (approximately over 40,000 jin per day), causing prices to fall: corn fell from 100 yuan (from the 5th to the 11th) to 80-78 yuan; during the same period, red sorghum fell from 93 yuan to 75 yuan, wheat remained at 118 yuan, and rice was 104 yuan-145 yuan. From the 25th to the 27th, due to rain and less grain entering the market, prices rose slightly: millet was 153 yuan-115 yuan, wheat 120 yuan-122 yuan, corn 86-84 yuan, and red sorghum 80-75 yuan. In southern Hebei, prices generally declined steadily. In Nangong and surrounding areas, due to lack of rain and the impact of rising grain prices in central Hebei, the price of miscellaneous grains rose once. On the 4th, red sorghum rose from 85 yuan to 95 yuan, millet rose from 80 yuan to 92 yuan, and red sorghum reached 100 yuan. On the 24th, the prices of various grains began to stabilize. In Linqing in the first ten days of the month: millet fell by 71 yuan per jin, millet was 87 yuan, and corn was 59 yuan, a decrease of 10-6 yuan compared to the beginning of the month. From the 14th to the 25th, millet rose again to 87 yuan and then fell to 78 yuan, and red sorghum was 50 yuan. In the old liberated areas of Hebei-Shandong-Henan, rain prevented grain from being transported out, and prices declined steadily and were lower than other regions. In Puyang, from the 8th to the 18th, millet was 53-50 yuan per jin, and wheat was 53-50 yuan. On the 18th, red sorghum was 36 yuan. During the same period, rice was 406 yuan per jin and red sorghum was 30 yuan in Zhangnan, Huilong, Chuwang, and other places. In the new Yellow River district, grain prices rose slightly due to the war. In Pandu, Yunbei, on the 2nd, wheat was 2100 yuan per dou and red sorghum was 1400 yuan, with each grain rising by 500-600 yuan compared to July.
    In the friendly neighboring liberated areas around the border region, grain prices were rising due to lack of rain. In Fuping, Hebei-Chahar-Hebei region, from the 28th to August 7th, millet rose by 10,000 yuan per dou, wheat rose by 6,000 yuan, and corn rose by 3,000 yuan. In the Jin-Sui region in late July, millet in Xingxian rose from 58,000 yuan to 110,000 yuan per dou, and wheat rose from 60,000 yuan to 88,000 yuan. Hebei Central and Bohai also experienced fluctuations; Xinji experienced a sharp rise on August 21st: wheat rose by 2,500 yuan per dou, millet rose by 1,000 yuan, and red sorghum rose by 3,000 yuan, now it has stabilized. From the 1st to the 9th in Dezhou, millet rose from 42 yuan to 58 yuan, and corn rose from 38 yuan to 52 yuan. In the KMT-controlled areas: Due to the transport of grain from the south to the north and the flow of northern floating capital to the south, the soaring prices have temporarily subsided. From the 5th to the 22nd in Tianjin, millet fell from 2,800 yuan to 2,600 yuan per jin, rice fell by 1,000 yuan compared to July to 5,500 yuan, and Shou Tong flour fell by 15,000 yuan to 185,000 yuan. In Jinan on the 20th, soybeans were 2,700 yuan per jin, a decrease of 1,000 yuan, and wheat was 2,350 yuan, remaining stable. However, after the KMT government announced new measures for import and export trade and foreign exchange management on the 17th, export goods in South China rose sharply, and consumer goods followed suit. In Hangzhou, raw silk rose from 16.94 million yuan to 19 million yuan per dan, tea rose from 300,000 yuan to 500,000 yuan per dan, and tung oil rose from 620,000 yuan to 800,000 yuan per day. Grain, flour, and cooking oil in Shanghai also rose by thousands to 120,000 yuan.
    Cotton: Since August, cotton prices have generally been weak and sales have been slow: Jiyuan and the opposite bank of Hebei-Shandong-Henan stopped exporting due to military operations. In Taiyue in early August, cotton was 550 yuan in Yicheng and 840 yuan in Guodao. In Jiyuan, cotton was 1,200 yuan per jin at the beginning of the month, 900-850 yuan on the 10th, and 850-800 yuan on the 20th. In Puyang, cotton was 730-720 yuan per jin in the first ten days of the month; and 600 yuan on the 18th. In southern Hebei, affected by the relatively relaxed import and export management in Dezhou, cotton in Lin(qing), Xia(jin), and Heng(shui) all turned to Dezhou for export, resulting in a sluggish cotton market and weak prices in the inland. In Linqing, good cotton was 540-570 yuan per jin and lower-grade cotton was 500 yuan from the 5th to the 26th, with a total transaction volume of over 150,000 jin in one week, a decrease of half compared to the past. Due to poor sales on the east and west lines, cotton in Handan also became quiet. Good cotton: 540 yuan on the 5th, with a daily transaction volume of over 2,400 jin. The price remained unchanged from the 12th to the 18th, with an average transaction volume of several hundred jin per day. The price rose slightly to 560 yuan per jin from the 15th to the 20th, with a daily transaction volume of over 2,000 jin, sold to Changzhi. The price fell to 530 yuan from the 21st to the 26th, with a daily transaction volume of several hundred jin. In Changzhi in the first ten days of the month, cotton prices were still high due to local people's need for cotton for textile: 750 yuan-650 yuan per jin, only retail sales were possible. The price rose to 780-770 yuan on the 18th, sold to Tunliu, Jincheng, and other places. On the 27th, cotton from Zhaocheng, Taiyue, entered the market at a low price (600 yuan per jin), affecting the price of cotton in Han(dan) and Wu(an): good cotton in Wu'an was 750 yuan-700 yuan per jin, still sold in retail. After the 25th, the price in Xingtai fell from 630 yuan to 600 yuan. The price in Yangyi fell from 650 yuan to 630 yuan on the 27th.
    In Dezhou since August, the cotton market has been unusually active due to smooth exports, with cotton from southern Hebei entering the city at over 500 bales per day. The price rose from 320 yuan to 380-370 yuan per jin (North Currency) in the first ten days of the month. Cotton in central Hebei was quiet: In Hejian, the price continued to fall from 6,100 yuan to 5,700 yuan (border region currency) from the 13th to the 24th, and in Xinji, the price rose from 3,600 yuan to 4,000 yuan (border region currency) from the 7th to the 21st.
    Native Cloth: Native cloth sales have generally been narrow this month, initially fast, then slow, and prices have been weak. In Handan from the 1st to the 4th, Guangping cloth flooded the market, and customers from Changzhi came to purchase in bulk, making the cloth market active. Good cloth was 260 yuan per chi (尺 - approx. 1/3 meter) (hereinafter the same), with a daily transaction volume of over 15,000 chi; since the 12th, there were more goods but fewer buyers, and the price fell to 250 yuan. The price rose again to 270 yuan on the 15th, with a daily transaction volume of over 20,000 chi - 15,000 chi. The market began to weaken on the 16th, and it became even slower by the 27th: due to less eastern cloth entering the market because of rain, the retail price was still firm at 270-290 yuan. In the Taihang area, since August, cotton prices have risen while cloth prices have not, resulting in a sharp decline in textile profits. Taking the cloth and cotton prices in Shexian as an example: in the spring, each jin of cloth (approximately 7.5 chi) could be exchanged for 4.5 jin of cotton, but now it can only be exchanged for 2.5 jin. Eastern cloth was 260 yuan on the 17th, and second-grade cloth was 220 yuan. On the 25th, the price fell to 250 yuan - no one wanted local cloth at this price. In Changzhi, the price fell from 250 yuan to 230 yuan per chi on the 12th, rose again to 270 yuan on the 17th, and fell to 250 yuan on the 25th. In Yangyi, the price was 1,700-1,800 yuan per jin in the first ten days of the month, but it fell to 1,600-1,580 yuan on the 23rd.
    In the friendly neighboring liberated areas around the border region, cloth prices also rose due to rising grain prices: In Xinji, central Hebei, Gaoyang cloth rose from 33,000 yuan to 36,000 yuan per piece on the 21st. In Xingxian, Jin-Sui, native cloth rose from 110,000 yuan to 120,000 yuan per piece in late July. Weaving machine cloth in Linxian was 130,000 yuan.
    Leather and Fur Emerged: In early August, leather and fur activities took place in Xingtai and Zaoying, Zaoqiang; on the 10th, in Xingtai, processed leather: white sheepskin was 2,700 yuan per piece, with 2,700 pieces transacted, and black sheepskin was 1,500 yuan per piece, with 1,700 pieces transacted. On the 11th, in Handan, processed leather: black sheepskin was 1,500 yuan, white sheepskin was 2,700 yuan, and purple sheep (@(jin)) was 300 yuan, each cargo exported through Daying. Cold sheepskin in Daying was 4,000 yuan, and mid-range sheepskin was 2,600 yuan.
    Salt: In early August, due to a price drop in Dezhou, the price rose from 520 North Currency to 560, and because rain fell in various places one after another, the amount of salt arriving varied, and prices fluctuated accordingly: In Linqing, the price once reached 120 yuan per jin on the 5th, 110 yuan on the 8th, with a daily transaction volume of over 10,000 jin, all sold to Handan. The price was 100 yuan on the 17th and 108 yuan on the 26th. In Handan, prices were also relatively flat and fast at the beginning of the month due to rising prices in Linqing: 150 yuan per jin on the 5th, with a daily transaction volume of over 8,000 jin, 158 yuan on the 11th, and 155 yuan from the 14th to the 27th, with a daily sales volume of several hundred jin to over 1,000 jin. In Changzhi, the price was 206 yuan per jin from the 10th to the 11th, a decrease of 9 yuan, 200-220 yuan on the 17th, and a decrease to 200 yuan on the 23rd. Salt prices were higher in northern Yue, in mid-August: 250 yuan in Jincheng and 280 yuan in Guodao. Along the Tongpu railway line, salt prices were particularly low due to the enemy dumping Lu salt in southern Shanxi to exchange for grain: Lu salt flowed into Jiyuan, and salt prices fell sharply in mid-August, from 280 yuan to 230 yuan per jin. In summary, salt prices were stable.
    Foreign Goods: Since August, foreign goods, except for pigments, have generally experienced price increases and fast sales, especially paper, soda ash, and sugar: Linqing, from the 8th to the 25th. Paper continued to rise from 14,000 yuan to 23,000 yuan. On the 16th, white sugar once reached 2,250 yuan, now it is 2,100 yuan, and brown sugar is 2,000 yuan-1,800 yuan, an increase of 500-400 yuan compared to July 27th. Soda ash is 1,100 yuan, a doubling compared to the beginning of July. Dawn matches are 52,000 yuan, an increase of 2,500 yuan compared to the first ten days of the month. The average daily transaction volume of foreign goods is over 10 million yuan, with matches and sugar accounting for 56% and paper and pigments accounting for 44%. In Handan, from the 5th to the 27th, soda ash continued to rise from 850 yuan to 1,300 yuan, white sugar rose from 1,950 yuan to 2,800 yuan, and brown sugar rose from 1,600 yuan to 2,160 yuan. Match prices were still stable, around 55,000 yuan per case. The average daily transaction volume was over 6 million yuan in the first ten days of the month and 7-5 million yuan in the middle ten days. Sugar was sold to Pengcheng, Wu'an, and other places in the first ten days of the month, and to Cheng'an and surrounding areas in the middle ten days. Reasons for the price increases: (1) The KMT's blockade intensified; (2) Due to the war, the enemy and bandits robbed roads, making transportation difficult; (3) Prices in the KMT-controlled areas rose: White sugar in Tianjin rose from 750,000 yuan to 800,000 yuan in the first ten days of the month, and sugar in Jinan has already risen to 1.5 million yuan.

    II. Financial Situation:
    Exchange Rates in This Region: In southern Hebei, prices were flat and weak in the first ten days of the month: In Linqing, the Jin Exchange (per 10,000 yuan of KMT currency) fell from 670 to 610-620 yuan from the 1st to the 13th; the Tianjin Exchange was 710 yuan. In Nangong, the Tianjin Exchange was 628-630 yuan from the 1st to the 22nd, rising to 660 yuan on the 10th, then falling to 650 yuan. The reason for the decline: Cotton exports and foreign exchange transactions shifted to Dezhou. KMT Currency Exchange Rates: In the Taiyue New District, most of the KMT currency was traded on the black market. In Xinjiang on the 18th, the rate was 1:10. In Yicheng in early August, the rate was 1:17. In Jiyuan on the 15th, the rate was 1:10-11.5. In Taihang, the rate was 1:15 in Anyang and 1:15 in Gaoyi from the 11th to the 14th. Gold Prices: Gold prices in this region rose due to the influence of enemy-controlled areas; at the beginning of the month, the black market price in Xinjiang, southern Shanxi, reached 290,000 yuan. Gold prices in Luoyang soared, and merchants from Jiyuan purchased gold with 300,000 yuan of local currency. On the 22nd in Handan, the black market price rose to 160,000-170,000 yuan. Merchants from Xingtai and Yicheng went to the KMT-controlled areas to purchase goods, carrying gold, and the enemy's purchase price in Linfen also rose. On the 19th, the black market price in Xingtai was 180,000-200,000 yuan, and in Yicheng on the 10th, it was 220,000 yuan.
    Friendly Neighboring Liberated Areas: In Hejian, central Hebei, 1.3 million yuan of gold was exchanged out and 1 million yuan (border region currency) was exchanged in on the 24th. KMT-controlled Areas: In Luoyang, the black market price was 4.5-5 million yuan on the 10th, 3.2 million yuan in Xi'an at the beginning of the month, 3.1 million yuan in Linfen in the first ten days of the month, 2.6-2.7 million yuan in Jinan on the 4th, and rose to 2.9 million yuan on the 20th, and 2.35 million yuan in Xinxiang on the 20th.
    Exchange Rates Between Local Currency and Various Currencies in Friendly Areas: On the 21st in Hengshui, the ratio between local currency and border region currency was 1:8.3, the ratio between local and North currency in the eastern line of southern Hebei was 1.4:1-1.9:1, and in the Yellow River area, it was 2 yuan:1. On the 10th in Anze, the ratio between local currency and Western Peasant Bank currency was 1:16, and in Guodao, it was 1:15.

    外货：八月来外货除颜料外，一般价升销快，尤以盘纸，碱面、糖类为著：临清八日——二十五日。盘纸由一四○○○元，续升为二三○○○元，十六日白糖曾达二二五○元，现为二一○○元，赤糖二○○○元——一八○○元，较七月二十七日前上五升○○元，——四○○元，碱面一一○○元，较七月初上升一倍，黎明火柴五万二千元，较上旬涨二五○○元，外货每日平均成交千余万元以上，其中火柴、糖类占百分之五六，纸张、颜料等占百分之四四。邯郸五日——二十七日，碱面由八五○元，续升为一三○○元，白糖由一九五○元，升为二八○元，赤糖由一六○○元升为二一六○元，火柴价尚平，每篓五五○○○元左右，上旬每日平均成交六百余万元以上，中旬七百——五百万元不等。火柴、糖类亦占大宗。糖上旬销彭城、武安等地，中旬销成安一带。上涨原因：（一）蒋区封锁加剧；（二）战争关系，敌顽劫路，运输困难；（三）蒋区货涨：天津白糖上旬由七五万元涨到八十万元，济南糖已涨一五○万元。
    二、金融情况：
    本区汇价：上旬冀南平疲：临清一日——十三日济汇（每万元蒋币）六七○下跌为六一○——六二○元；津汇七一○元。南宫一日至二十二日津汇六二八——六三○元，十日升为六六○元，后跌为六五○元，下跌原因：如棉花出口，外汇交易转移德州所致。蒋币行情：太岳新区蒋币大部打入黑市，新绛十八日一比一○，翼城八月初一比一七，济源十五日一比一○——一一、五。太行十一日——十四日安阳一比一五，高邑一比一五。金价：本区金货因受敌区影响价升；月初晋南新绛黑市曾达二九万元，洛阳金价狂涨，来济源商人以三○万本币收买。邯郸二十二日黑市涨到一六——一七万元，邢台、翼城商人赴蒋区购货携金，又临汾敌收买价涨，十九日邢台黑市一八——二○万元，翼城十日二二万元。
    友邻解放区：冀中河涧二十四日黄金兑出一三○万元，兑入一○○万元（边币）。蒋管区：洛阳十日暗市四五○万——五○○万元，西安月初三二○万元，临汾上旬三一○万元，济南四日二六○——二七○万元，二十日上涨为二九○万元，新乡二十日二三五万元。
    本币与友区各种货币比值：衡水二十一日，本与边比为一比八点三，冀南东线本北比为一点四比一一—一点九比一，黄河南为二元比一。安泽十日本比西农为一比一六，郭道为一比一五。
