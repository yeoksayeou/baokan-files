　　Changzhi City Forms People's Court
　　Publicly Try and Execute Chiang Kai-shek Special Agents

　　[Report from Changzhi City, this newspaper] The case of Cao Wanling and Wang Debin, the chief and deputy directors of the Chiang Kai-shek special agent office in Handan-Changzhi, has been thoroughly investigated by the city's Public Security Bureau since its exposure last October. On the afternoon of August 30th, over three thousand workers and shop assistants from Changzhi City gathered at Hero Square to hold a joint public trial meeting of industry and commerce, electing six people including Manager Cui of Long Mao Xing and Director Song of the trade union to form a People's Court. After Director Song explained the significance of the meeting, Section Chief Wang of the Public Security Bureau announced the crimes of the accused: 1. Cao Jinpeng, the leader of the 6th detachment of the Kuomintang special agents stationed in Anyang, contacted Wang Debin and Cao Wanling in July last year. Cao and Wang then sent people to Anyang to make contact and also contacted Wang Ziquan, a puppet army leader, accepting the special agent task: under the guise of businessmen, they would organize a Handan-Changzhi special agent work team office in Changzhi City, receiving a monthly living allowance of 30,000 yuan (customs gold units). 2. When the mass movement began last winter, they encouraged the targets of struggle, saying, "Don't be afraid, the Chiang Kai-shek army is coming soon, and then we can settle accounts and get everything returned to us." They spread propaganda that the Eighth Route Army's words could not be trusted and that they would not stay in Changzhi for long. 3. They developed a special agent network, recruiting over ten people in Changzhi City and seven in Pingshun, assigning them destructive tasks. 4. When apportioning business burden taxes after the autumn, Wang Debin, using his position as a cadre of the Chamber of Commerce, privately doubled the burden, causing some merchants to be unable to afford it and subsequently close down, attempting to create opposition between merchants and the government. 5. During the soaring prices, the criminal took the opportunity to borrow one million yuan from the bank, buying large quantities of market cloth to raise prices, increasing the price of each foot of homespun cloth by five yuan, hoarding and speculating, creating unprecedented price increases, and also buying large quantities of gold and silver from Jincheng to sell to the enemy area. 6. During the movement, Wang Debin, from his position as a production member of the special commissioner's office, specialized in issuing travel permits, allowing dozens of major struggle targets and special agents such as Yu Xinzai and Li Baojun to escape to places like Beijing and Anyang. 7. When he was the acting manager of Yu Ji, he provoked the relationship between the special commissioner's office and the judicial section, telling the judicial section that "the special commissioner's office does not allow investment in Yu Ji (in reality, he did not allow it)." He also embezzled 600,000 yuan of public funds, preparing to seize control of all of Yu Ji's finances under favorable conditions and abscond with a large sum of money to defect to the enemy.

　　Finally, the presidium called on everyone: "Speak out your grievances, voice your complaints." Shop assistant Zhao Duxing jumped out of the crowd and went to the stage, angrily recounting that when he was a shop assistant at Yu Ji in the past, Wang Debin, in his position as manager, provoked discord in his marital relationship, attempting to cause a divorce. A worker from Daxing Freight Store complained that Cao Wanling used his position as deputy manager to suppress employees and provoke disunity. Once, because the shop assistant did not sweep the snow off the top of his chamber pot in winter, he scolded him severely. Another time, he scolded a new shop assistant for shaking the light bulb a few times when opening the electric door. At this time, many shop assistants continued to complain, and the masses' hatred for the special agents could no longer be endured, shouting: "Hand over the special agents for us to deal with ourselves!" The presidium immediately approved the masses' request. The workers' militia on the stage immediately threw the two special agents off the stage to the east and west sides, and the masses rushed up, and the two special agents received the punishment from the people.

　　长市组成人民法庭
  　公审处决蒋特要犯
    【本报长治市讯】蒋特邯（郸）长（治）办事处正副主任，曹万岭、王德彬破坏案，自去年十月破获后，经市公安局多方侦查审讯，现已告大白。长市工人店员三千余人，于八月三十日下午齐集英雄场，召开工商联合公审大会，选出隆茂兴崔经理、工会宋主任等六人为主席团组成人民法庭。由宋主任说明开会意义后，公安局王股长宣布该人犯罪状为：一、住安阳之国特第六分队长曹锦奉，在去年七月间和王德彬曹万岭取得联络，曹、王即派人到安阳接头，并和伪军头子王自全取得联系，接受特工任务是：以商人为名，在长市组织邯长特务工作队办事处，每月领生活费三万元（关金）。二、当去冬群运开始时，他们鼓励斗争对象说：“不要害怕，蒋军快来了，那时可进行倒算，把东西全部给咱们退回”。宣传八路军不算话，在长治住不久。三、发展特务组织，在长治市已发展有十余人，平顺七人，分别布置了破坏任务。四、秋后派营业负担税时，王德彬利用商会干部地位，私自将负担数增加一倍，致使一些商人出不起，而倒闭关门，企图造成商人和政府对立。五、物价暴涨时，该犯乘机到银行货款一百万元，大量收买市场花布，抬高市价，每尺土布抬高市价五元，囤积居奇，造成空前的物价暴涨，并由晋城收买大批黄金、白银卖往敌区。六、运动中王德彬从专门开路条，（是专署生产员）放跑大斗争对象和特务于新斋、李保钧等数十人，到北平、安阳等地。七、在予记任经理时，挑拨专署和司法科的关系，对司法科说“专署不让往予记投资（实际是他不让）。”并贪污公款六十万元，准备在有利条件下，掌握全部予记的经济，大量携款潜逃投敌。
    最后主席团号召大家：“有苦诉苦，有冤申冤。”店员赵杜兴从人群中跳出走上台去，愤恨的诉出他过去在予记当店员时，王德彬以经理地位，挑拨他夫妇关系不睦，企图造成离婚。大兴货栈伙友诉出曹万岭利用副经理地位，打击职员，挑拨相互团结，一次因冬天店员给他提夜壶没有把上面的雪扫净，他就痛痛的骂了一顿。一次因开电门，把电灯摇恍了几下，也把新来的小店员骂了一顿。这时仍有好多店员继续诉苦，台下群众对特务的愤恨再也不能忍耐了，喊出了：“将特务交给我们自己处理！”主席团立即批准了群众的要求，台上的工人纠察队，随手将二特务仍下台的东西两侧，台下群众蜂涌而上，二特务得到了人民对他的惩罚。（王澎、王迅、岳龙）
