　　Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains Front, 12th: The Liu-Deng army has launched an offensive on the eastern front in recent days, capturing four cities in succession in the southwest of Chaohu Lake, and is now pressing towards Hefei, the capital of Anhui Province, controlled by the Chiang bandits. The army liberated Huoshan on the 4th and Shucheng on the 8th. The Chiang bandits fled in panic, and our army seized a large amount of spoils. On the 11th, Tongcheng and Lujiang county towns were captured in one fell swoop, killing dozens of bandits below the rank of company commander, capturing one company commander and more than 50 soldiers, and seizing two machine guns, more than 40 rifles, and a large amount of wealth.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains Front, 14th: A certain unit of the Liu-Deng army, which penetrated deep into eastern Hubei, continued to advance south after liberating Luotian county town, and liberated Xishui (i.e., Qishui) county town on the banks of the Yangtze River on the 11th. The Chiang army guarding the city fled in panic. The People's Liberation Army has good discipline and a far-reaching reputation. When it marched into the city in formation, the masses of the whole city welcomed it on both sides of the street, and order was quickly restored to normal.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains Front, 8th: Arriving Late: The People's Liberation Army under the command of Generals Liu Bocheng, Deng Xiaoping, Xu Xiangqian, and Li Xiannian, after annihilating nine and a half brigades of the Chiang army in southwestern Shandong, set off from Yuncheng and Juye on August 7th according to the original plan for a southern expedition. After twenty-one days and a journey of more than a thousand miles, they arrived victoriously in the Dabie Mountains on August 27th. As of September 6th, they had successively recovered the county towns of Shanxian, Ningling, Suixian, Zhecheng, Boxian, Huaiyang, Shenqiu, Xincai, Xiangcheng, Shangcai, Linquan, Xixian, Gushi, Guangshan, Huangchuan, Macheng, Lihuang, Lu'an, Huang'an, and Luotian, as well as important towns such as Mamuyu, Popi River, Zhutangdian, Songbu, and Yeji. Since the army set off on August 7th, it swept away more than 20 Chiang and puppet strongholds on both sides of the Longhai Railway, controlled more than 120 miles of railway, and captured a battalion of the 21st Brigade of the 88th Division of the Chiang army, as well as the security regiments of Luyi, Sui County, and Ningling, and Wan Xiangchun, the former Major General Deputy Division Commander of the 127th Division of Ningling County, totaling more than 3,000 people. The army crossed the Longhai Railway to the south on the 11th, and then crossed the Yellow Flood Area, which was 30 miles wide, and crossed important rivers such as the Wo River, Sha River, Ying River, Hong River, Ru River, and Huai River. When crossing the Ru River, it defeated the Wu Shaozhou unit of the 85th Division of the Chiang army, which had occupied the bridgehead position before us, inflicting heavy casualties. The army crossed the river safely and advanced into the Dabie Mountains with irresistible force. Gushi was liberated on the 24th, Guangshan was captured on the 27th, and Huangchuan, an important town in southeastern Henan, was captured on the 28th. The Chiang army dared not hold on firmly and fled in panic; the panic and shake-up of its military morale can be seen from this. Shangcheng was captured on the 29th. Macheng and Songbu to its southwest were captured on the 31st. Lihuang city was liberated on September 2nd, annihilating the 564th Regiment of the 188th Brigade of the 46th Division of the Chiang army and more than 1,000 members of the Lihuang Security Team; Lu'an city was captured on the same day. Huang'an was captured on the 4th. Luotian was captured on the 6th. (Attached picture)
