　　Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains Front, August 28th (Delayed Dispatch) The counter-offensive army under Generals Liu Bocheng and Deng Xiaoping has victoriously reached the Dabie Mountains. After crossing the Yellow River and eliminating nine and a half brigades of the Chiang army, the Liu-Deng army, following the original plan, began this great historical feat, a heroic southern expedition. Departing from between Yuncheng and Juye in southwestern Shandong on August 7th, the army overcame all difficulties along the way, taking twenty-one days, traversing over a thousand li, crossing the Longhai Railway, wading through the Yellow River flooded areas, passing major rivers such as the Wo River, Sha River, Ying River, and Hong River, and finally forcing the Ru River and rushing across the Huai River to reach its destination. The army was irresistible, successively liberating eleven county towns including Ningling, Suixian, Zhecheng, Boxian, Huaiyang, Shenqiu, Xincai, Xiangcheng, Shangcai, Linquan, and Xixian. When crossing the Ru River, the 85th Division of the Chiang army, under Wu Shaozhou, occupied the ferry crossing before us, attempting to block our advance. A portion of our army, with swift and courageous action, captured the bridgehead position, covering the safe passage of the main force; and routed Wu Shaozhou's unit, killing and wounding many enemies, and seizing dozens of truckloads of ammunition. The Yellow River flooded area was as wide as thirty li, with villages submerged in water, the army wading forward, mud up to the knees. All such obstructions by the Chiang army and natural obstacles were overcome one by one. The people along the way, unable to bear the Chiang family's tyranny, were overjoyed to see the liberation army, either recounting their grievances, acting as guides, or building bridges and supporting boats, giving the southern expedition army great encouragement and help.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains Front, August 30th (Delayed Dispatch) The Liu-Deng army, entering the Dabie Mountains with irresistible force, has successively liberated Gushi, Guangshan, Huangchuan, and Shangcheng. Wherever the army went, the Chiang army's morale wavered, and they fled at the sound of the wind. The Liberation Army liberated Gushi on August 24th, Guangshan on August 27th (Note: Guangshan was the first county town seized by the Chiang army from the People's Liberation Army after the ceasefire agreement took effect on January 13th of last year), and Pipi River to its southwest, capturing more than eighty scattered soldiers of the 56th Division of the Chiang army fleeing from Huangchuan, and seizing small cannons and machine guns. On August 28th, the important town of Huangchuan in southeastern Henan was captured. Shangcheng was captured on August 29th. At this moment, the Liberation Army has re-entered the Dabie Mountains and entered the liberated area from which it was forced to withdraw in July of last year, only a year and two months apart. As early as after the failure of the Great Revolution in 1927, the Dabie Mountains, located at the junction of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui, was one of the base areas of the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, the predecessor of the People's Liberation Army. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the New Fourth Army relied on this area to establish the Hubei-Henan-Anhui Anti-Japanese Base Area. This time, the Liberation Army arrived amidst the people's fervent expectations in the mountains, and the elders welcomed them along the road, expressing their deep concern, their first sentence being: "Our troops have returned."

　　刘邓大军长驱南进胜利到达大别山区
  　连克立煌六安麻城等八县城
    【新华社中原前线八月廿八日电】（迟到）刘伯承、邓小平两将军所部反攻大军，已胜利到达大别山区。刘邓大军自横渡黄河，歼灭蒋军九个半旅以后，即按照原定计划，开始此一伟大的历史壮举，英勇南征。计于八月七日从鲁西南郓城、钜野间出发，排除前进途中一切困难，历时二十一天，行程千余华里，横跨陇海铁路，涉越黄泛区域，通过涡河、沙河、颖河、洪河等重要河流，最后强渡汝河，抢渡淮河而到达目的地。大军所向披靡，先后光复宁陵、睢县、柘城、亳县、淮阳、沈邱、新蔡、项城、上蔡、临泉、息县等十一座县城。渡汝河时，蒋军八十五师吴绍周部先我占领渡口，企图阻我前进。我军一部以迅速勇猛动作，攻占桥头阵地，掩护大军安然渡过；并将吴绍周部击溃，杀伤敌人甚众，缴获弹药数十车。黄泛区宽达三十余华里，村庄淹在水中，大军涉水前进，泥深及膝。凡此种种蒋军之阻挠与天然之障碍，均经一一克服。沿途人民不堪蒋家暴政，一见解放大军，莫不欢欣鼓舞，或伸诉冤苦，或担任响导，或搭桥撑船，予南征大军以极大之鼓励与帮助。
    【新华社中原前线八月三十日电】（迟到）以破竹之势进入大别山区之刘邓大军，先后解放固始、光山、潢川、商城等四城，大军所至，蒋军军心动摇，闻风而逃。解放军计于八月二十四日克固始，二十七日克光山（按：光山为去年元月十三日停战协定生效后，蒋军从人民解放军手中抢夺之第一座县城），及其西南之泼皮河，俘获自潢川逃来之蒋军五十六师散兵八十余，缴小炮机枪各三。二十八日克豫东南重镇潢川城。二十九日克商城。刻解放军已重新挺进大别山，并进入去年七月被迫撤离之中的解放区，前后相距仅一年又两个月。远在民国十六年大革命失败以后，位于豫鄂皖交界之大别山处，即为人民解放军前身的工农红军根据地之一。抗战期间，新四军更曾依托此地区创立鄂豫皖抗日根据地。此次解放军在山区人民热切盼望之中到达，父老夹道欢迎，殷切慰问，他们第一句话就是：“我们的队伍回来了”。（附图片）
