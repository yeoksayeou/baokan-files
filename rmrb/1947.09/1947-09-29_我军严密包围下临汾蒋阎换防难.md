Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 27th: Under the impact of the Chen-Xie army's southern campaign, Hu Zongnan was anxious to withdraw the troops besieged in Linfen, but Yan Xishan was unable to take over the defense, resulting in repeated urgings and an embarrassing situation. The four regiments of the 30th Division of Hu's army in Linfen originally planned to break through from the land and escape to Ji County first. Its division headquarters led two regiments and sneaked to the area west of Xiangling on the 7th, but was severely attacked by the Taiyue Liberation Army, forcing them to shrink back into the city. They urgently changed to airlift. On the 21st, Xi'an dispatched planes to transport two regiments, and urged Yan to quickly send troops to take over the defense. However, Ling Shi, the southernmost stronghold of the Yan-occupied area in southern Shanxi, is less than 100 kilometers away from Linfen, but it is separated by the three cities of Huo County, Zhao City, and Hongdong controlled by the Liberation Army, making it unattainable for Yan. In late last month, Wang Jingguo personally led two regiments to venture south, but as soon as they entered the area between Jiexiu and Lingshi, they were intercepted and forced back by the Taiyue Liberation Army. Yan then changed his strategy and sent more than 80 company and platoon-level officers disguised as deserters and released prisoners, attempting to sneak into Linfen along the Tongpu Railway. However, due to the strict vigilance of the militia sentries, Yan's troops were captured one after another. A certain village militia in the Third District of Hongdong captured the commander of their armored vehicle and a company and platoon commander in one day. Yan was extremely anxious and is now piecing together three regiments of the remnants of the 46th Division, 73rd Division, and 45th Division stationed in Jiexiu, which were defeated in the central Shanxi plain, intending to use these remnants to open a passage to the south.

Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 27th: The Yan bandits' "government-in-exile" and defeated armed forces from Hongdong, Zhao City, and other counties who have fled into the isolated city of Linfen in southern Shanxi are facing increasing difficulties in life under the continuous attacks and encirclement of our local corps and guerrillas, and are making a living by looting. A certain merchant in Gao Gu Dian on the outskirts of the city was robbed of property worth 800,000 yuan one night at the end of last month, and Wu Village's grocery store and restaurant were also looted. The looting has spread to the internal ranks of the Yan bandits. A certain plainclothes agent robbed 250,000 yuan in cash, but was robbed by another Yan soldier surnamed Du. The pseudo-district public office in the Second District fought fiercely with each other due to unequal distribution of spoils. The Zhao City security police team robbed grain everywhere, but all the gains were pocketed by the officers. For example, 150 shi of wheat was robbed in Puan Village at one time, but more than half of it was sold off halfway, while the soldiers often had no shoes to wear and walked barefoot. Therefore, there were more and more cases of desertion with weapons. The team originally had more than 160 people, but now there are few left. The masses on the outskirts of the city, unable to bear the harassment of the Yan bandits, rose up to resist, and three Yan bandits have already been disarmed by the masses. Mu Sen, the pseudo-county magistrate of Zhao City, was frightened by the激忿 of the masses and dared not step out of the city gate, and the captain of the "revenge team" also claimed to be "recuperating" and refused to show his face.

This newspaper, Taiyue, 26th: Jia Zhenmin, the special agent district chief of Wanquan Second District, was captured alive, and a movement to dig out the "bottom line" was launched. On the 2nd of this month, the Chiang army in Yuncheng harassed Yi (Shi) and Linjin, and the various stubborn special agents trapped in Yuncheng took the opportunity to destroy land reform and set up many special agent "bottom lines" in the Second District. Our Second District cadres and the masses cooperated with the local armed forces to carry out a general campaign to eliminate special agents and dig out the "bottom line." At 8:00 a.m. on the 4th, more than 30 armed special agents were defeated in Dong Yaozhuang, and after the special agent district chief Jia Zhenmin was captured alive, the local masses combined with the land reform movement to launch a movement to dig out the "bottom line." In five days, Chen Yanzhuang, Dong Yao, and other villages have dug out nine people and put forward anti-spy discipline such as not leaving bad people.

    我军严密包围下临汾蒋阎换防难
    【新华社晋绥二十七日电】在陈谢大军南征震撼下，胡宗南急欲将困守临汾的部队撤走，阎锡山却接防不上，一催一急，窘态百出。临汾胡军三十师所属四个团，原拟从陆上突围先逃往吉县，其师部率两个团七日曾窜抵襄陵以西地区，当遭太岳解放军兜头痛击，被迫缩回城内，乃急改空运，二十一日已由西安派机运走两个团，并紧催阎贼迅速派队接防。但晋南阎占区最南据点灵石虽近距临汾不及百余公里，中间却横隔着解放军控制下的霍县、赵城、洪洞三城，致阎贼可望而不可及。上月下旬，王靖国亲率两个团冒险南下，甫入介休、灵石中间地区，即被太岳解放军迎阻迫退。阎贼乃改派营连级军官八十余人，化装为逃兵及被释俘虏，企图沿同蒲路分散潜往临汾。但民兵岗哨严密，阎军纷纷落网，洪洞三区某村民兵一天内即捕获其装甲车队长及营连长各一名。阎贼焦急万状，现正拚凑由晋中平川败退之四十六师、七十三师及驻介休之四十五师等残部三个团，意欲以残兵败将打开一条南下的通路。
    【新华社晋绥二十七日电】逃入晋南孤岛临汾城之阎匪洪洞、赵城等县“流亡政府”及残败武装，在我地方兵团、游击队连续打击与围困下，生活日益困难，以抢劫糊口。城郊高古店某商人于上月尾一夜被劫财物值价八十万元，吴村杂货铺及饭馆亦被洗劫一空。抢风已发展至阎匪内部，某便衣抢得二十五万元现款，但被另一杜姓阎军抢走。二区伪区公所则因分赃不均，而互相凶殴。赵城保警队四出抢粮，但所得均为军官中饱，如一次在普安村抢麦一百五十石，中途即被粜出过半，而士兵却常无鞋穿，赤脚走路，因此携械逃跑者日多，该队原一百六十余人，现已所余无几。城郊群众不堪阎匪骚扰，奋起抗击，已有三名阎匪被群众缴械。赵城伪县长穆森慑于群众之激忿，不敢步出城门，“复仇队”队长亦声言“养病”拒不露面。
    【本报太岳二十六日电】万泉二区活捉特务区长贾振民，展开挖“底线”运动。本月二日，运城蒋军出扰猗（氏）、临晋等地、困居运城之各县杂顽特务，便乘机四窜破坏土地改革，在二区按下不少特务“底线”，我二区干部与群众配合地方武装，普遍进行清剿特务挖“底线”。四日晨八时，在东姚庄击溃武装特务三十余人，活捉特务区长贾振民之后，当地群众即结合土改运动，掀起了挖“底线”运动，五天中陈阎庄、东姚等村，已挖掉九名，并提出不留坏人等反特纪律。
