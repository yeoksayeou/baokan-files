　　Continuing the Victory of the Summer Grain Struggle
  　Launching the Autumn Harvest Defense Movement
    Wu Guangtang
    This year, in the Summer Grain Defense Struggle in various parts of Taihang, widespread victories were achieved. Under slogans such as "Starve Chiang Kai-shek to death, don't let Chiang Kai-shek seize a single grain of wheat" and "Defend the grain for the counter-offensive victory," all Party, government, military, and civilians, men, women, young, and old, were involved in the struggle to "protect wheat and protect fields" and "distribute wheat and distribute fields." We truly achieved quick harvesting, quick threshing, quick drying, and quick storage; a mass-based rush harvesting movement of "all at once" in harvesting, threshing, drying, and storing. The reason we were able to achieve victory in the Summer Grain Struggle, in addition to the active combat of troops, militia, and work teams to strike the enemy, and the heroic struggle of cadres leading the masses, adhering to their posts, mobilizing the masses, and sharing life and death with the masses, which deserves great praise, is due to the following main experiences, which should continue to be promoted:
    1. The grain protection struggle must be combined with the peasant emancipation movement: In the newly recovered areas, we immediately proposed "anti-traitor liquidation" and "distribution of wheat and distribution of fields" (such as in Ye County), with cadres leading and supporting the masses, quickly launching a village-by-village, county-wide peasant emancipation movement. This combined opposition to enemy plunder with the recovery of their own hard-earned money; in the temporarily occupied areas, the grain protection struggle was combined with anti-reversal of accounts (such as in Qinbo). Experience has shown that protecting wheat for autumn planting is the best time to reverse accounts. The masses were mobilized to seize back the wheat that landlords had taken back through reversals of accounts, arresting and suppressing the ringleaders of the reversals, and further developing the movement to consolidate the results; in general border areas, the masses, after being mobilized, proposed "protect wheat and protect fields" (Yutai, etc.), not allowing the enemy to seize a single grain, defending the fruits of emancipation, and defending their own hard-earned money. Precisely because the grain protection struggle was closely combined with the peasant emancipation movement, making the anti-plunder and the protection of the masses' interests completely consistent in action, the grain protection struggle became a conscious and voluntary mass movement. This experience should be clarified in the leadership's thinking and continue to be promoted in the Autumn Harvest Defense.
    2. Grain protection is an armed struggle of the whole people, and a widespread mass-based guerrilla war must be launched to achieve victory. During this year's summer harvest, under the slogan of "protect grain and protect life," guerrilla warfare was widely launched. Not only did regular troops, local regiments, work teams, and militia directly participate in this struggle, but the masses also directly supported and became involved, becoming a mass struggle. The troops proposed: "One hand holds a gun, the other holds a hoe." The First Sub-district annihilated a company of Wei Yonghe's troops at the outset; the Taiyuan militia won six battles out of six; other local battalion soldiers, work teams, and militia all launched movements to kill enemies, perform meritorious service, protect wheat, and rush the harvest, inflicting significant casualties on the enemy and achieving many victories. In the organizational work of combining labor and military affairs, many experiences were also created: the militia covering the masses rushing the harvest; the militia and masses exchanging labor and land; organizing guerrilla work teams; everyone rushing the harvest when there was nothing to do, and when there was fighting, the rush harvest immediately turned into a combat group. In terms of tactics: landmine warfare, sniper warfare, hornet warfare, joint defense warfare, and tunnel warfare were all used more skillfully, making the enemy dare not act rashly and inflicting heavy casualties. In the Chiang Kai-shek-controlled areas, where the Chiang Kai-shek clique was squeezing the people, uprisings were organized to rush the harvest under the slogan of "rather starve than be robbed, follow me if you want to live" (such as in the urban area of ​​Huo Lu); militia from the hinterland also went to support, fully demonstrating the great unity of the army and the people, and the unity of the front and the rear. The mass guerrilla war made the enemy beaten everywhere and running into walls everywhere, completely in a passive position.
    3. Seize the time and seize the initiative. In the Summer Grain Struggle, we took the initiative completely. At the beginning, we proposed the action slogan of "strike first, gain the upper hand, and seize the initiative" (such as in Taiyuan). In armed struggle, we organized active and extensive offensives, pre-emptively striking the enemy, disrupting their plans, and confusing their steps. We organized capable armed forces to penetrate their "security areas," and smash their puppet organizations (such as in Tangyin), creating a state of political paralysis, making them unable to use their administrative power, creating a chaotic order, to contain the enemy's actions, making them unable to attend to both ends, seizing the initiative, and pushing the struggle into the enemy's heartland (Qinyang, Huo Lu, etc.), breaking the passive situation of the grain protection struggle being stuck in the enemy's mobile connecting areas. In the mass rush to harvest, it was proposed: "Ripen a piece, cut a piece, cut a grain, thresh a grain" (Fourth Sub-district). We had been rushing the harvest for four days, and the enemy only began to move out (Second Sub-district), causing the enemy to loot in vain. Some areas completed the surprise attack overnight, catching the enemy off guard (such as the urban area of ​​Qinyang). The rush to harvest and transport grain everywhere was done with a high degree of seizing the time and seizing the initiative. One area, one day, one night, or at most five days, completed the entire task. Many areas combined with mass movements, harvesting in the morning, struggling in the afternoon, and dividing in the evening, coming quickly and fiercely, catching the enemy, puppets, and landlords off guard, completely in a passive position. It was precisely because we took the initiative, and the emancipation movement and guerrilla war were launched everywhere, showing great momentum, further exciting and inspiring the morale of the masses, and winning back many people who had fled. At the same time, after the victory of the rush harvest, we quickly transported the grain to the hinterland, did a good job of clearing the fields, established a guerrilla living order, and prepared for a long-term struggle. This is an important step that cannot be missing to achieve the victory of the struggle. Any complacency or fluke, without preparing for a long-term struggle, is harmful and should be overcome.
    4. Promoting the grain protection struggle with a campaign of meritorious service and model commendation: It was generally proposed in the army: "Protecting grain and killing enemies to perform meritorious service for the people." It was proposed among the masses: "Protecting the counter-offensive grain, protecting your own blood and sweat" and "Supporting the front line and performing meritorious service for the people." The Second and Fourth Special Districts formally promulgated reward measures for the summer harvest struggle, which played an active and encouraging role for both the army and the people, and promoted the enthusiasm of the army and the people to fight together, and many heroes and models emerged. When summarizing, Taiyuan selected 172 cadres, battalion soldiers, militia, and mass heroes and models from districts and villages; under the encouragement of the meritorious service campaign in the First District of Jiaozuo, 396 mu of wheat were harvested in five days and five nights, and 82 models were selected, ranging from 72-year-old men to 12-year-old children, and immediate encouragement and commendation were given, with flowers and celebrations, which greatly encouraged the emotions of the masses. Cadres at all levels were also involved in the movement, leading the masses to rush the harvest, demonstrating the heroic spirit of sharing weal and woe with the masses and adhering to the struggle. Comrade Cheng Jie, secretary of Taiyuan County, personally led the militia to the Seventh District, fighting and rushing the harvest. He encountered danger several times; Comrade Li Fuqing, the deputy secretary, led the masses to rush the harvest despite his illness. Comrade Li Jiacheng, the head of the First District of Qinyang, led the masses to rush the harvest directly into the urban area. Liu Sanyang, who resisted the enemy with 300 men and died heroically in Wuzhi, was posthumously awarded the title of head of the Xiaogao District by the masses, and the town of Xiaogao was renamed Sanyang Town. Comrade Chen Xinlin of Boai requested to join the Communist Party before his death. The above heroic deeds, which can be sung and wept, all demonstrated the determination of cadres and the masses to adhere to the struggle together, greatly excited the masses, and played a great role in the victory of the grain protection struggle.
    5. Strengthening unified leadership and launching a comprehensive grain protection struggle are also important conditions for the victory of the grain protection struggle: Experience has proven that only when the Party, government, military, and civilians have consistent thinking and unified steps can victory be guaranteed. In this year's Summer Grain Struggle, the unity of all systems and the unity of the army and the people in the unified struggle were fully demonstrated. The troops not only fought but also helped the masses rush the harvest. The troops in northern Henan proposed: "One hand holds a gun, the other holds a sickle," "shedding blood and sweat," and the masses praised them as the world's first army; the troops in the northern front won the battle and also helped with the harvest, and the masses presented a banner of "war production, uniting the masses"; the troops of the Fifth Sub-district, in the midst of intense training, used their rest time to help the masses in Tangyin rush the harvest for five days, harvesting 50,000 mu of wheat; among the masses, the hinterland supported the border areas, and more than 200 militiamen from Shahe went to Huo Lu to support the protection of wheat; the militia in the hinterland of the Second Sub-district also went to the border areas to support, fighting when the enemy came, and rushing the harvest when they didn't; the mountainous areas of Xiuwu, Wuzhi, and Jiaozuo supported the plains; under the slogan of "not letting the bandits rob a single grain," the masses in the Second and Third Districts of Qinyang helped the masses in the urban area complete the rush harvest; the stretcher teams of the participating militia on the front line of northern Henan (Counties Ci, Hui, She, etc.) launched a rush harvest and love-the-people movement, helping the masses in the border areas rush the harvest, and all the stretcher teams became rush harvest teams, and the commendation committee became the production committee, unified leadership, and launched a competition to love the people and help the harvest, helping to cut wherever they went; In the Second Sub-district, in Yutai and other places, the industrial, commercial, and trade systems also actively participated in purchasing and regulating grain to help the masses protect the grain; faculty, staff, and students of colleges and universities in Qinyang and Boai also participated in the harvest assistance movement. All of this shows that the grain protection struggle is an armed struggle of the whole people, and it is also the main content of guerrilla warfare. Under the unified leadership of consistent thinking and unified steps, closely connected with the interests of the masses, the masses were fully mobilized, and the victory of the struggle was achieved.
    Although the summer harvest has been successfully completed, a more complex and cruel struggle to defend the autumn harvest is about to come. At present, around our region, the military victories have caused the enemy to shrink and stubbornly defend themselves in a few tortoise shells such as Taiyuan, Shijiazhuang, Anyang, Xinxiang, and Jiaozuo, which are like isolated islands, and the northern front has suffered serious natural disasters, and the puppets and diehards need grain more urgently. Taiyuan and Shijiazhuang are already feeling the grain panic, crying out "die of coal if not of grain." Our victory in defending the autumn harvest will give the enemy greater difficulties. Therefore, the enemy will inevitably loot grain more frantically regardless of life or death, making the autumn harvest struggle more complex and acute. However, we have the foundation of the victory of the Summer Grain Struggle, we have seized the time to mobilize the masses, and the continuous military victories have further encouraged the masses' will to fight and their confidence in victory. As long as we make good use of the experience of the Summer Grain Struggle, mobilize the masses on the basis of defending the interests of the masses, combine the masses' demands for revenge, emancipation, armed grain protection, and life protection, launch a mass-based guerrilla war, seize the time, seize the initiative, widely organize according to the principle of combining labor and military affairs, the hinterland supports the border areas, the rear supports the front, and launch a comprehensive autumn harvest defense movement under unified leadership, we will surely be victorious.

　　继续夏粮斗争的胜利
  　开展保卫秋收运动
    武光汤
    本年太行各地保卫夏粮斗争中，普遍取得了胜利，在“困死蒋贼，饿死蒋贼，不让蒋贼抢走一粒麦”及“保卫反攻胜利粮”等口号下，全体党政军民，男女老少，都卷入了“保麦保田”“分麦分田”的斗争中；真正做到了，快收、快打、快晒、快藏；收打晒藏一齐光，“一锅煮”的群众性的抢收运动。我们在夏粮斗争中，所以能取得胜利，除了部队、民兵、武工队主动作战打击敌人；干部领导群众，就地坚持，发动群众与群众同生共死的英勇斗争，值得大加表扬外；还有以下几点主要经验，应继续加以发扬：
    一、护粮斗争必须与农民翻身运动相结合：在新收复区一开始即提出“反奸清算”“分麦分田”（如邺县等地），干部领导撑腰作主，很快即开展了村村点火全县冒烟的分麦分田翻身运动，使反对敌人掠夺与收回自己血汗结合起来；被敌人暂时侵占的沦陷区，护粮斗争与反倒算相结合（如沁博等地），经验证明，保麦种秋是反倒算的最好时机，发动群众被地主倒算回去的麦子抢收回来，逮捕与镇压倒算头子，进一步开展运动，巩固成果；一般边沿区，群众经过发动，则提出“保麦保田”（榆太等地），不让敌人抢走一粒粮，保卫翻身果实，保卫自己血汗，正因把护粮斗争与农民翻身运动密切结合在一起，使反掠夺与保卫群众利益在行动上完全一致，护粮斗争便成为自觉自愿的群众运动，这一经验，应该在领导思想上明确起来，在保卫秋收中继续加以发扬。
    二、护粮是全民的武装斗争，必须广泛的开展群众性的游击战争才能取得胜利。今年夏收中，在“保粮保命”的口号下，普遍的开展了游击战争，不只正规军、地方兵团、武工队、民兵直接参加这一斗争，而群众也直接支援与卷入了进去，成为群众性的斗争。部队提出：“一手拿枪，一手拿锄”。一分区一开始即歼灭魏永和部一个连；太谷民兵曾六战六捷；其他各地营兵、武工队、民兵、都开展了杀敌立功护麦抢收运动，与敌重大杀伤，取得不少胜利，仅太谷半个月地雷杀敌达一百二十八名。在劳武结合组织工作上，亦创造了很多经验：民兵掩护群众抢收；民兵群众换工换地；组织游击拨工队；无事大家抢收，一有战事，抢收即变为参战组。在战术上：地雷战、冷枪战、黄蜂战、联防战、地道战等，都运用的更加熟练，使敌人不敢轻举妄动，并给予重大杀伤。蒋顽压榨的蒋管区，在“不抢饿死，要活跟我来”的口号下（如获鹿城关区），组织暴动抢收；腹地民兵亦前往支援，充分表现了军民大团结，前后方一条心，群众性的游击战争，使敌到处挨打、到处碰壁，完全处于被动。
    三、争取时间，争取主动。在夏粮斗争中，我们完全采取了主动。一开始即提出：“先下手为强，争取主动”的行动口号（如太谷等地）。在武装斗争上，组织主动的广泛出击，预先予敌人以打击，打乱其计划，混乱其步骤，组织精干武装深入其“治安区”，打垮其伪组织（如汤阴等地），造成政治麻痹状态，使其无力运用其行政力量，造成混乱秩序，以箝制敌之行动，使其首尾不能相顾，争取主动，把斗争推向敌之腹心（沁阳获鹿等地），打破了护粮斗争胶着在敌我游行衔接地区的被动局面。在群众抢收上则提出：“熟一片、割一片、割一粒、打一粒”（四分区），我们抢收已四天，敌人才开始出动（二分区），使敌人抢掠扑空。有些地区一夜即突击完成，使敌人措手不及（如沁阳城区）。各地的抢收运粮都在高度的争取时间争取主动，一个地区一天一个晚上，最多五天即全部完成任务。好些地区与群运相结合，早上收、午上斗、晚上分，来的快、来的猛，使敌伪地主一时措手不及，完全处于被动。正是由于我们采取了主动，翻身运动与游击战争到处开展，表现声势浩大，更加兴奋与鼓舞了群众斗志，争取回不少逃亡出去的人。同时我们在抢收胜利后，把粮食很快运到内地来，做好空室清野，建立游击生活秩序，准备长期坚持斗争，这是贯澈斗争胜利不可缺少的重要步骤，任何麻痹侥幸，不做长期斗争准备，都是有害的，应该注意克服。
    四、以立功表模运动推动护粮斗争：在部队中普遍提出：“护粮杀敌为民立功”，在群众中提出：“保卫反攻粮，保卫自己血汗”“支援前线，为民立功”。二专四专都正式颁布了夏收斗争奖励办法，对部队群众都起了积极鼓舞作用，发扬了军民一起斗争的积极性，涌现了不少功臣模范。太谷在总结时，即选出区村干部、营兵、民兵、群众功臣模范一百七十二人；焦作一区、在立功运动鼓舞下，五日五夜收麦三百九十六亩，选出上至七十二岁老汉，下至十二岁儿童模范八十二人，并做到了即时鼓励，即时表扬，献花庆贺，给群众情绪很大鼓舞。各级干部也同样卷入了运动，带领群众进行抢收，表现了与群众同甘共苦，坚持斗争的英勇精神。太谷县书程节同志，亲自领导民兵到七区，又打仗，又抢收。曾数次遇险；分书李福庆同志带病领导群众抢收。沁阳一区长李嘉诚同志领导群众直接抢收到城关。武陟刘三阳抗敌三百壮烈牺牲，群众追赠他做小高区长，并将小高镇易名为三阳镇。博爱陈鑫林同志临死要求加入共产党，以上这些可歌泣的英勇事迹，都表现了干部与群众一起坚持斗争的决心，大大兴奋了群众，对护粮斗争的胜利，起了很大作用。
    五、加强一元化领导，开展全面的护粮斗争，也是护粮斗争胜利的重要条件：经验证明，必须党政军民思想一致，步调统一，才能保证胜利。本年夏粮斗争中，充分表现了各系统的团结一致、军民一致的一元化斗争。部队不只打仗，还帮助群众抢收。豫北部队提出：“一手拿枪，一手拿镰”，“流血又流汗”，群众誉之为天下第一军；北线部队打胜仗，又助收，群众献给“战争生产、团结群众”的锦旗；五分区部队在紧张的练兵中，利用休息时间，帮助汤阴群众抢收五天，收麦五万亩；在群众中，则腹地支援边地，沙河二百余民兵到获鹿支援保麦；二分区腹地民兵也到边地支援，敌来就打仗，不来就抢收；修武、武陟、焦作山地支援平地；沁阳二三区群众在“不让土匪抢走一粒粮”的口号下，帮助城区群众突击收完；豫北前线参战民兵担架队（磁、辉、涉等县）开展抢收爱民运动，帮助边沿区群众抢收、全体担架队，变成了抢收队，评功委员会，变成生产委员会，统一领导，开展爱民助收竞赛，走到哪里，帮助割到哪里；二分区榆太等地，工商贸易系统，也积极参加收购调剂粮食，帮助群众护粮；沁阳、博爱高校教职员学生，也参加了助收运动。这都说明护粮斗争，是全民的武装斗争，也是游击战争的主要内容。在思想一致步调一致的一元化领导下，与群众利益紧接在一起，充分的发动了群众，取得了斗争的胜利。
    夏收虽然胜利渡过，但更加复杂的惨酷的保卫秋收的斗争行将到来。目前本区周围，在我军事胜利中，使敌紧缩的困守在形同孤岛的太原、石门、安阳、新乡、焦作等几个乌龟壳里，而北线又遭严重灾荒，伪顽需要粮食更加迫切，太原、石门已感粮食恐慌，惊呼“不死于粮食必死于煤炭”，我们保卫秋收的胜利，将给敌人以更大的困难。因此，敌人必然会更疯狂的不顾死活的掠夺粮食，使秋收斗争更复杂化与尖锐化。但我们有夏粮斗争胜利的基础，争取时间发动了群众，军事的不断胜利，更加鼓舞了群众的斗争意志与胜利信心。只要我们很好的运用夏粮斗争的经验，发动群众在保卫群众利益的基础上，结合群众复仇、翻身，武装保粮、保命的要求，开展群众性的游击战争，争取时间，争取主动，根据劳武结合的原则，广泛的组织起来，腹地支援边地，后方支援前方，在一元化领导下，开展全面的保卫秋收运动，我们一定能胜利的。
