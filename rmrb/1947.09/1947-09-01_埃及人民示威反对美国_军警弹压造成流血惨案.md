  　Military Police Suppression Causes Bloody Tragedy
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 27th: Cairo dispatch: Brazil's suggestion in the Security Council to resume British-Egyptian negotiations without the Security Council taking direct action has in recent days aroused nationwide demonstrations and protests in Egypt, with the masses shouting "Down with the United States." On the 22nd, Egyptian Prime Minister Nokrashy urgently telegraphed from the United States to suppress all mass movements, and bloody tragedies have occurred in various places due to the suppression by the military police. On the 22nd alone, in Cairo, more than 100 people were killed and injured, and the leader of the Muslim Brotherhood, Banna, was also injured. In other places such as Alexandria and Port Said, the casualties among demonstrators shot by military police were even more tragic.

　　埃及人民示威反对美国
  　军警弹压造成流血惨案
    【新华社陕北二十七日电】开罗讯：巴西在安理会上建议恢复英埃谈判而无须安理会出诸直接行动一案，连日来已激起埃及全国膨湃汹涌之示威抗议游行，群众高呼“打倒美国。”埃总理诺克拉希二十二日自美急电镇压一切群众运动，各地均发生因军警弹压而起之流血惨案。仅二十二日在开罗一地，群众死伤即达百人以上，回教兄弟会领袖班纳亦因而受伤。其他各地如亚历山大与塞得港，示威群众被军警枪击伤亡者尤为惨重。
