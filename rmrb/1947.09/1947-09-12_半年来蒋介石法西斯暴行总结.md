　　Summary of Chiang Kai-shek's Fascist Atrocities in the Past Six Months
　　Hu Maode
　　It has been six months since Chiang Kai-shek expelled the delegation of the Chinese Communist Party in early March. Chiang Kai-shek expelled the CCP delegation with the aim of turning the KMT-controlled areas into a dark abyss, and to carry out even more inhumane massacres of the people in those areas. In the past six months, Chiang Kai-shek, relying on American blood transfusions, has accumulated an astonishing blood debt to the people in the KMT-controlled areas. According to extremely incomplete statistics from newspapers and news agencies in the KMT-controlled areas, from the beginning of March to the present, more than 42,529 innocent people have been arrested by Chiang Kai-shek's military police, secret agents, and American military police, and more than 20,420 have been brutally beaten, injured, or killed. These atrocities have occurred in 27 cities, including Nanjing, Shanghai, Beijing, Tianjin, Chongqing, Chengdu, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Kaifeng, Guiyang, Fuzhou, Suzhou, Jinan, Guilin, Xuzhou, Changchun, Shenyang, Zhangjiakou, Taiwan, Huaiyin, and Weixian. The number of victims in Xi'an, Lanzhou, Kunming, Hangzhou, Jinhua, and Nanchang are unknown and not included in the above statistics.

　　Chiang Kai-shek's fascist atrocities in the past six months can be roughly divided into two periods: The first period was the bloody suppression of the people in the KMT-controlled areas' opposition to the American policy of subjugating China, the movement to expel American troops, and the Taiwan people's autonomy movement in March and April. As a prelude to this period, the fascist police district system, mutual guarantee law, and joint liability law were widely implemented in various parts of the KMT-controlled areas in January and February of this year. The pretext for the arrests during this period was "checking household registrations," but in reality, it was an attempt to eliminate all patriotic and democratic forces in its ruling area after the expulsion of the CCP delegation, in order to carry out more unbridled traitorous, dictatorial, and civil war policies. The arrests and atrocities began in Beijing, then Shenyang, and from Shenyang to Chongqing, Qingdao, Tianjin, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Fuzhou, and other places. By the end of April, more than 26,455 people had been arrested and more than 20,000 had been injured or killed during this stage. The most cruel was the bloody suppression of the Taiwan people's autonomy movement. According to a written statement issued by leaders of the Taiwan Association in Beijing and the Association of Taiwanese Students, "More than 80,000 people in Taiwan were massacred, and more than 20,000 were seriously injured. Under the rule of Japanese warlords, the Taiwanese people had never seen such a bloody massacre" (United Press, Shanghai, April 11). Taiwan had the highest number of victims during this period, followed by Qingdao and Beijing, with over 6,000 in each of the first two locations, and over 2,000 in the latter.

　　Chiang Kai-shek's murderous claws extended to students, workers, professors, journalists, cultural figures, businessmen, members and leaders of the Democratic League, and even civil servants of Chiang's administrative agencies. Among the well-known figures arrested and killed were Zhang Zhihe, a member of the Central Committee of the Democratic League; Fu Dingyi and Wang Zhixiang, old professors in Beijing; Song Feiru, a specialist on Japanese issues and the director of the Taiwan People's News; Zeng Minzhi, the interviewing director of the Chongqing edition of the Ta Kung Pao; Li Kang and Tang Hongren, the chief and deputy interviewing directors of the Democratic League newspaper; Zhang Yifeng, the manager of the China and Foreign Publishing House; and Yu Ruqi, the director of the Beijing branch of Chiang's Executive Relief Administration.

　　American imperialists have not only repeatedly encouraged and supported Chiang Kai-shek's inhumane and barbaric massacre materially, but have even directly helped the perpetrator. When the Chiang Kai-shek clique bloodbathed Taiwan and killed people enthusiastically, Truman announced on April 27 that he would hand over 271 American ships and floating docks to his adopted son. Forty officers of the Chiang family army also went to the United States to study "detective techniques." In June, when Chiang Kai-shek's cruel massacre aroused condemnation from Chinese and foreign public opinion, and even Chiang Kai-shek's former American advisor, Owen Lattimore, telegraphed Chiang Kai-shek to stop the massacre, the U.S. State Department announced on June 28 that it would sell 130 million rounds of ammunition to the Chiang government at a low price, fueling his murderous flames. As the All-China Students' Federation recently pointed out in its declaration: the arms and ammunition used by Chiang Kai-shek to massacre the people are all supplied by the United States. The brutal killing of three students from Wuhan University by Chiang's secret agents using American-made Dum-Dum bullets is a prominent example of countless tragedies. Not satisfied with cheering and fueling the flames from the sidelines, American imperialists even directly collaborated with Chiang Kai-shek to arrest and massacre the Chinese people. The two major arrests in Qingdao on March 9 and Tianjin on March 16 were carried out jointly by American military police and Chiang's military police under the pretext of "arresting those who oppose the American policy toward China" (TASS, Shanghai, March 16). On May 4, when students in Shanghai marched past Avenue Joffre, American military police assisted and colluded with Chiang's police to arrest students. Recently, in his statement leaving China, Wedemeyer rebuked the Chiang Kai-shek clique for being "muddle-headed and incompetent." In fact, he was blaming Chiang Kai-shek for not killing enough people and not being cruel enough, which prevented him from successfully achieving his goal of subjugating China.

　　The second period was from May to the end of June, during which the student and people's movements against hunger, civil war, and oppression in the KMT-controlled areas were brutally suppressed. The atrocities started in Beijing and then spread to major cities such as Shanghai, Nanjing, Kaifeng, Guangzhou, Chengdu, Chongqing, Hankou, Guiyang, Fuzhou, and Lanzhou. During this period, more than 13,527 people were arrested and more than 415 were killed or injured. Guangzhou had the most arrests, with over 3,000, followed by Shanghai with 2,600, Hankou with 1,900, and Guiyang with 1,800. The massacres perpetrated by Chiang Kai-shek in Beijing and Tianjin on May 20 and the Guangzhou massacre on May 21, resulted in the immediate arrest and massacre of 399 people on the spot in those three locations, shocking the world. Since June, Chiang Kai-shek's fascist atrocities have continued. For example, in August, "more than 2,000 innocent people were arrested in Northeast China on the pretext of being 'communist suspects' and sent to concentration camps in Hankou" (Associated Press, Shanghai, August 15).

　　The cruelty of Chiang Kai-shek's bloody massacre of the people exceeded that of the beasts Hitler and Mussolini. During the May 20th demonstration of 5,000 students in Nanjing, he dispatched more than 10,000 soldiers, police, secret agents, and special agents, using American-style submachine guns, pistols, water cannons, and clubs to massacre unarmed petitioning students. He even used cavalry to try to disperse the students' demonstration. On that day, ribs were broken, eyes were blinded, and blood was shed, resulting in 123 deaths and injuries. In May, more than ten people had their eyes gouged out by Chiang's secret agents in Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin. Innocent arrested people were secretly killed or imprisoned in concentration camps, "subjected to various tortures, such as pouring cold water, electric chairs, and strangulation with wet towels" (see Zhang Lianzhen's article "I Accuse" in the Shanghai English-language Millard's Review in April). Farmers around the Tianning Temple concentration camp in Changzhou, Jiangsu, said: "The sound of screams can be heard all night long. It is estimated that two to three hundred people are killed every day, and corpses are piled up, exposed in the wilderness" (Xinhua News Agency, Central China, April 23).

　　However, Chiang Kai-shek and American imperialism's attempt to suppress the Chinese people, who refuse to be subjugated, with bestial torture and massacres cannot be realized. On the contrary, this only shows that the crisis of the American and Chiang rule in China has deepened. On April 10, when Chiang Kai-shek inspected the Youth Army in Shanghai, he dared not walk in broad daylight, but first drove to Longhua Airport, then flew to Jiangwan Airport, and then drove from Jiangwan to Hongkou. This shows to what extent this traitor, hated by the people, was timid and guilty! The more Chiang Kai-shek and American imperialism kill and arrest people, the more they arouse the resistance of the Chinese people who are fighting for survival. Even in the Nanjing massacre on May 25, the students bravely seized the weapons of Chiang's military police and resisted. On June 10, 1,500 students in Beijing gathered at Peking University and swore: "The only way to achieve Chinese democracy is to use our blood to defeat the dictator." In the joint edition of Peking University's various student association wall newspapers, "Our Attitude," it was advocated to settle accounts with Chiang Kai-shek for his crimes of civil war. At the end of June, in the seventh issue of the Shanghai Wen Cui Cong Kan public opinion poll, 299 people, accounting for more than 98% of the total of 303 people, advocated thoroughly defeating the Kuomintang reactionaries and realizing lasting peace. The blood debt that Chiang Kai-shek and American imperialism owe to the Chinese people will be repaid in double. And the day of total reckoning is not far away.

　　半年来蒋介石法西斯暴行总结
    胡懋德
    自三月初蒋介石驱逐中共代表团瞬届半年了。蒋介石逐退中共代表团，目的即在把蒋管区变成一片漆黑，更惨无人道的屠杀蒋管区人民。在过去半年中，倚赖美国输血的蒋介石，已积欠了蒋管区人民一笔惊人的血债。据蒋管区报纸及各通讯社极不完全的材料统计，从三月初到现在，无辜人民遭受蒋介石军警宪特及美宪兵逮捕的在四万二千五百二十九人以上，惨遭殴打伤亡的在二万零四百二十人以上。暴行遍及京、沪、平、津、渝、蓉、汉、穗、汴、筑、榕、苏州、济南、桂林、徐州、长春、沈阳、张家口、台湾、淮阴、潍县等二十七城市，其中西安、兰州、昆明、杭州、金华、南昌被害人数未悉，未列入上述统计。
    这半年来蒋介石的法西斯暴行，大致可划分为两个时期：第一个时期，是其三、四月间对蒋区人民反对美国亡华政策、驱逐美军运动暨台湾人民自治运动的血腥镇压。作为这一时期的先声，是今年一、二月间蒋区各地普遍推行了法西斯的警管区制和联保法、连坐法。这个时期逮捕的借口是“检查户口”，实际上是企图在驱逐中共代表团之后，在其统治区域内肃清一切爱国民主力量，以便更肆无忌惮的卖国独裁内战。逮捕暴行首先开始于北平，继而沈阳，由沈阳而重庆、青岛、天津、上海、广州、福州等地。至四月底为止，这一阶段被捕人数二万六千四百五十五人以上，伤亡在二万人以上。其中最残酷的要算血洗台湾人民自治运动。据台湾旅京协会、台籍学生协会等领袖发表书面声明称：“台湾八万余人被屠杀，两万余人负重伤，在日本军阀统治下，台湾人从未见过这样的流血屠杀”（美联社四月十一日沪电）。此时期被害人数以台湾为最多，其次为青岛、北平、天津，前两地各为六千余人以上，后者则在二千人以上。
    蒋介石杀人血爪遍及学生、工人、教授、记者、文化界、商人、民主同盟盟员及领袖，甚至蒋家行政机构的公务员亦在其内。其中知名人士如民盟中委张志和、北平老教授符定一、王之相、日本问题专家台湾人民导报社长宋斐如、大公报渝版采访主任曾敏之、民盟机关报正副采访主任李康、唐弘仁、中外出版社经理张亦风、蒋家行总北平分署署长于汝祺等均在被捕被害之列。
    美国帝国主义者对于它的走狗蒋介石这种惨无人道的野蛮屠杀，不仅一再在物质上予以鼓励支持，甚至直接出手帮凶。当蒋介石集团血洗了台湾，杀人杀得起劲的时候，杜鲁门就在四月二十七日宣布以美舰艇二百七十一艘及浮动船坞交给其干儿子，蒋家军官四十名也到了美国研究“警探术”。六月间当蒋介石的残酷屠杀激起中外舆论谴责，甚至蒋介石前美籍顾问拉铁摩尔亦电蒋介石停止屠杀暴行时，美国国务院就在六月二十八日宣布以一亿三千万发子弹廉售与蒋政府，助长其杀人凶焰。如同全国学联最近在宣言中指出：蒋介石用以屠杀人民的武装弹药全由美国供给，武汉大学三个学生被蒋特用美制达姆弹惨杀，即为无数惨案中显著的一例。美国帝国主义者在旁喝采加油还不以为足，还要直接协同蒋介石逮捕屠杀中国人民。三月九日青岛及三月十六日天津两次大逮捕，是美宪兵在“逮捕反对美国对华政策者”的借口下，与蒋家宪兵共同执行的（塔斯社三月十六日沪电）。五月四日沪学生游行路经霞飞路时，美宪兵帮凶，协同蒋警逮捕学生。最近魏德迈在其离华声明中，呵斥蒋介石集团“颟顸无能”，事实上也就是责备蒋介石杀人还不够多，还不够残暴，使其亡华目的不能顺利实现。
    第二个时期是五月至六月底对蒋管区学生、人民反饥饿、反内战、反压迫运动的野蛮镇压。暴行首自北平开始，继而蔓延上海、南京、开封、广州、成都、重庆、汉口、贵阳、福州、兰州等各大城市。这一时期，被捕人数在一万三千五百二十七人以上，死伤在四百一十五人以上。捕人最多计广州为三千人以上，上海二千六百人，汉口一千九百人，贵阳一千八百人。五月二十日蒋介石在京津的大屠杀，和五月二十一日的广州大屠杀，三地当场被逮捕屠杀即达三百九十九人，使全世界为之震骇。自六月以后，蒋介石的法西斯暴行是一直进行的，例如八月间即在东北以“共产党嫌疑犯罪名逮捕二千余无辜人民，押送汉口集中营”（美联社八月十五沪电日）。
    蒋介石血腥屠杀人民的残酷程度，较之野兽希特勒和墨索里尼有过之而无不及。在南京五月二十日五千学生大游行中，他出动了一万以上的军、警、宪、特，用美式冲锋枪、手枪、水龙、木棍屠杀徒手请愿学生，甚至用骑兵企图冲散学生的示威行列，当日被打断肋骨，打瞎眼睛、鲜血淋漓，因而死伤者达一百二十三人。五月间京、沪、津三地被蒋特刺瞎眼睛者即在十人以上。处置无辜被捕者是秘密杀害或囚诸集中营中，“以各种毒刑，如灌冷水、电椅、以湿水毛巾绞头等酷刑拷打”（见四月份沪英文密勒士评论报张莲珍“我控诉”一文）。江苏常州天宁寺集中营周围农民谈：“惨号之声彻夜可闻，估计每天杀人在二三百以上，尸骨累累，暴露郊野”（新华社四月二十三日华中电）。
    但是蒋介石以及美帝国主义，要以兽性的毒刑和屠杀来压服不甘做亡国奴的中国人民的企图是无法实现的，恰恰相反，这只是表示美蒋在华统治的危机更深刻化了。四月十日当蒋介石在沪检阅青年军时，他不敢在光天化日之下走路，而先坐车至龙华机场。再坐飞机至江湾机场，再由江湾坐车至虹口，足见这个为万民所憎恨的卖国贼胆怯心虚至何种程度！蒋介石以及美帝国主义愈是杀人捕人，就愈发激起中国人民死里求生的反抗。就是在五月廿五日南京大屠杀中，学生们已经英勇的抢夺蒋家军警的武器予以反抗，六月十日北平学生一千五百人在北大集会宣誓：“获致中国民主的唯一办法是用我们的血打独裁者。”在北大各社团壁报联合版“我们的态度”一文上主张清算蒋介石内战的罪恶。六月底沪文萃丛刊七辑民意测验答案中，主张彻底打垮国民党反动派，实现持久和平者达二百九十九人，占总数三百零三人百分之九十八以上。蒋介石及美帝国主义所积欠中国人民的血债，将要加倍偿还。而总清算的日子已不远了。
