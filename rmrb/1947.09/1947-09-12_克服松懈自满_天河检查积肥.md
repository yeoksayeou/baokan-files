　　Overcoming Laxity and Complacency
　　Tianhe Inspects Manure Accumulation
　　[Our newspaper Changzhi News] After the northern and southern Tianhe areas of the Second District proposed applying 60 loads of fertilizer per mu to half of the wheat fields, in order to avoid empty promises and ensure plans are fulfilled, a manure accumulation inspection campaign was launched on the 30th of last month, based on mutual aid teams. The following thoughts were discovered: (1) "Good Enough" mentality. Wang Pangou said: "Our team is good enough, no need to accumulate more manure or reclaim wasteland"; the Cao Linshui brigade generally reflected: "It's almost enough, we'll just plant it when the time comes." (2) Complacency. Song Shuangfu said: "Our team won't need until August 5th, we can finish planting by the 25th of this month." (3) Every man for himself. Wang Genban relied on his livestock, saying: "I can plant these three or two mu of wheat before August 5th, I can finish planting it in less than 20 days, I'll just sprinkle some night soil when the time comes." (4) Dislike of the high wage-grain cost for mutual aid teams, unwilling to plant wheat. Many widowed and labor-less households, because they cannot afford wages, do not plant much wheat. Fu Wang's wife and others said: "We want to plant wheat, but we can't afford the wage-grain." (5) Habitually not fertilizing wheat fields after crop rotation. Ren Gaize (Lai Cheng's wife) said: "We've never fertilized this wheat field after crop rotation, we just rotate the crops." It was found that all 203 mu of crop-rotated wheat land in the whole village were not planned to be fertilized at all. Due to the existence of these ideas, the manure accumulation work was relaxed. After discovering these ideological problems, the ideas were straightened out by conducting thorough inspections of each group based on their specific situations with precise calculations. After the labor hero Cao Linshui Brigade inspected, it was discovered that there was still no fertilizer for 66 mu of wheat land. Group member Wang Genban's planting of three mu of rotated land just for sending manure, plowing, and planting would take more than ten days, and everyone would have to help to complete the planting. After inspection, everyone did the math and straightened out the "good enough" and complacent thoughts, eliminated the "every man for himself" mentality, and actively prepared wheat field fertilizer. The wage-grain was reduced from six jin four liang old scale to five jin new scale, and plowing was reduced from twelve jin old scale to six jin new scale. Many widowed and labor-less households happily said: "Now we can plant wheat." As for the problem of not fertilizing stubble wheat land, labor hero Cao Linshui talked about his experience in planting wheat the year before: Tianhe used to be unable to grow wheat, just changing some stubble wheat, because without fertilization, one mu would only yield one or two dou. When Changzhi was liberated, I listened to the government and had the worst mu of land grazed by sheep for two half-days, applying ten loads of night soil, and when the wheat was harvested, it yielded one shi four dou old scale. After he said this, everyone actively prepared fertilizer for the stubble wheat land. Through accumulating fertilizer, another 618 mu of wheat fields were expanded. Southern Tianhe has 482.8 mu of wheat land, with a new addition of 214 mu, already having 27,980 loads of wasteland miscellaneous manure, 1,920 loads of human manure, and 1,670 jin of oil cake. The existing fertilizer can be applied to 513 mu of land, still lacking 1,698 loads of fertilizer. It is planned to accumulate 7,650 loads of wasteland manure, 160 loads of human manure, and 340 jin of oil cake. The labor hero Cao Linshui Brigade, with 66 mu of land, plans to accumulate 4,480 loads of wasteland manure and 400 jin of oil cake, with 80 loads of wasteland manure per mu. Under his promotion and influence, the entire village is challenging themselves, working hard to complete the manure accumulation in five days. (Han Lin, Sheng Xiu, Ling Yi)

　　[Our newspaper Licheng News] On September 2nd, the Xiwu Village in the First District convened a meeting of cadres, heroes, and mutual aid team leaders to inspect the wheat planting preparation work. After the team leaders reported, it was found that more than 460 mu of wheat land had not been plowed twice, and some fertilizer had not been transported to the fields. The whole village has accumulated 29,800 loads of fertilizer for a total of 1,160 mu of wheat land, averaging 25 loads of fertilizer per mu. Everyone said that the fertilizer was too little, and it was not enough even for the regular stubble wheat land. The whole village still has to plant 600 mu of rotated stubble, which must be planted thinly. Labor hero Zhang Wanghu said: "Planting without fertilizing is a waste of labor. As the saying goes: People fool the land, the land fools the stomach. Planting more rotated stubble requires more fertilizer." Everyone launched a discussion and proposed to accumulate another batch of fertilizer, striving to apply 35 loads of fertilizer per mu. The five brigades are to accumulate another 10,000 loads, mainly relying on scraping wasteland and composting artemisia. Each group proposed to completely eliminate native wheat. The 1,160 mu of wheat in the whole village will be completely planted with 169 wheat. The seven members of the technology committee will distribute specific guidance to each team and group, and carry out uniform warm water seed soaking to do the wheat planting technology carefully. Deputy Village Chief Han Xingwang said: "Seeds soaked in salt water do not grow mold. When people sow seeds, it is best not to use a three-legged drill, because the ridges are narrow and cannot grow. 169 wheat should be planted thinly and early. If it is planted late and densely, the ears will be small, the grains will be small, and the awns will not open, making it difficult to thresh." Political Director Sun Laohu said: "Last year I planted 169 wheat, without two legs, using a plow to plow wider ridges, first sow the wheat seeds, then spread the fertilizer, and then harrow it flat, so that the fertilizer can be used on the wheat seedlings. It grew very well this summer!" After everyone discussed and deliberated for a while, they unanimously agreed that 169 wheat should be planted early rather than late, thinly rather than densely. Each team made precise calculations and decided to sow the seeds in advance, completely finishing the planting around the White Dew solar term. (Ren Qing, Zhitian, Chang Xin)

　　克服松懈自满
  　天河检查积肥
    【本报长治讯】二区南北天河提出麦田二分之一每亩施肥六十担后，为了不放空炮，计划不落空起见，特于上月卅一日以互助组为单位，开展积肥检查运动，发现有这样几种思想：（一）差不多思想。王胖狗说：“我们组差不多啦，不用再积肥薰荒啦”；曹林水大队普通反映说：“差不多了，到种时种上就算”。（二）自满思想。宋双富说：“我组不用说到八月初五，这月二十五日就能种完”。（三）各顾各的思想。王根板仗凭自己有牲口，说：“我种这三、二亩麦还等到八月初五日，不到二十日就种完啦，到种时洒上些圊就行”。（四）嫌互助组工资米高，不愿种麦。很多孤寡无劳力的户，因出不起工资，就不多种麦，富旺妻等说：“想种麦，就是出不起工资米”。（五）习惯上改茬麦地就不上肥，任改则（来成老婆）说：“咱这改茬麦地就没上过肥，调调茬就行”。统计全村改麦地二百零三亩就根本没打算上肥。由于存在这几种思想，就放松了积肥工作，发现这些思想问题后，根据各个思想情况，用精确计算各组深入检查，打通了思想。劳动英雄曹林水大队检查后，发现还有六十六亩麦地没肥料，组员王根板种三亩改三亩光送粪、犁地、下种就得十来天，还得大家来帮助才能种完。经检查，大家算了一下帐，才打通了差不多与自满思想，消除了各顾各的思想，积极准备麦地肥料，工资米由老秤六斤四两降低到新秤五斤，犁地老秤十二斤降低到新秤六斤。很多孤寡无劳力户才高兴的说：“这咱就能种麦了”。至于茬麦地不上肥问题，劳英曹林水说了说他前年种麦经验：咱天河从前就不能种麦，就是改些茬麦，因不上肥一亩只打一斗二斗，我在长治解放时，听上政府的话，把最坏的一亩地用羊群站了两晌，上了十来担圊粪，收麦时打了老斗一石四。经他这样一说，大家才积极准备茬麦地肥料，通过积肥料，又扩大麦田六百十八亩。南天河有麦地四百八十二点八亩，新增二百十四亩，已有荒杂粪二万七千九百八十担，大粪一千九百二十担，油饼一千六百七十斤，现有肥料能上地五百十三亩，尚缺肥料一千六百九十八亩，准备积荒粪七千六百五十担，大粪一百六十担，油饼三百四十斤。劳动英雄曹林水大队，地六十六亩，准备积荒粪四千四百八十担，油饼四百斤，荒粪每亩八十担。全村在他推动影响下，都提出挑战，鼓着劲要五天完成积肥。（韩林、生秀、令意）
    【本报黎城讯】一区西仵村于九月二号召开干部英雄互助组长会议，检查种麦准备工作。经各组长汇报后，检查尚有四百六十余亩麦地没有犁过二犁，还剩一部分肥没有运到地里。全村共积肥二万九千八百驮，共麦地一千一百六十亩，每亩平均上肥二十五驮，大家都说肥少，都运到正茬麦地还不多，全村还要种六百亩改茬麦，就得薄种。劳动英雄张王虎说：“种地不上肥，白白多误工，俗话说：人哄地皮，地哄肚皮。多种改茬必须多上肥。”大家展开讨论，提出再积一批肥，每亩争取上肥三十五驮，五个大队要再积一万驮，主要依靠刮荒、沤蒿。各组提出要彻底消灭土小麦。全村一千一百六十亩麦完全种一六九七技术委员会七个人，分配各队各组具体指导，统一进行温汤浸种，把种麦技术精细做好。副村长韩兴旺说：“种籽经过盐水浸，不生霉，人下种时最好不用三条腿耧种，垅窄长不起来。一六九小麦宜稀宜早种，种的迟了稠了穗头小，籽粒小，撑不开麦芒又难打。”政治主任孙老虎说：“我去年种一六九，没有两条腿，用犁耕的垅宽点，先溜麦种，后溜肥，然后耢平，肥劲都能使在麦苗上，今年夏天长的可是好哩！”大家酝酿讨论了一会，一致认为一六九，宜早不宜晚，宜稀不宜稠，各队精确做了计算，要提前下种，白露前后完全种完。（任卿、芝田、长欣）
