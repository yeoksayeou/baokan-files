　　Military Region's Training Regiments Implement Lenient Policy
  　Release Two Thousand Captured Officers
  　And Provide Sufficient Travel Expenses Based on Distance
    [Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper] Military Region News: In order to implement our army's lenient policy, help captured Chiang army officers escape the bitter sea of civil war, and answer the officers' demands to fight for the establishment of an independent and democratic new China by overthrowing the reactionary rule of the Chiang family, our military region has, from June to the end of August this year, successively graduated officer trainees. Among the released officers, 432 voluntarily joined the People's Liberation Army, 314 entered our military and political schools to continue their studies and were willing to stay and work in our army. A total of 2,183 were unwilling to be cannon fodder for the Chiang gang again, but were burdened by their families and had no choice but to return to their original homes in the Kuomintang-controlled areas. The rest, whose families were in the liberated areas, have also returned home to live in peace.

    Since the beginning of June, People's Liberation Army officers studying in the training regiments of our military regions have continuously graduated. On June 7, a training regiment of a certain military region first held a graduation ceremony. The People's Liberation Army officers themselves decorated the venue, displayed their past academic achievements, and exhibited many fake passes they had previously attempted to forge to desert, hidden documents and party membership cards, and candid materials about their personal class and history, as well as declarations of withdrawal from the Kuomintang, etc., a dazzling array that clearly showed the process of their ideological progress. These things that they had previously kept secret were now voluntarily brought out.

    The People's Liberation Army officers from Taihang and Taiyue held a grand graduation ceremony followed by a lavish meal. Our cadres personally participated in the reception and toasted them for their safe return home. They all received varying amounts of travel expenses depending on the distance, some as much as hundreds of thousands of legal tender. Before leaving, the military officers from the Taiyue Training Regiment held a farewell meeting with our cadres. Due to the harmonious relationship they had enjoyed in the past, many officers shed tears of farewell.

    When the People's Liberation Army officers of a certain training regiment graduated, the regimental headquarters returned the belongings that had been kept for them, not only returning the items to their original owners, but also compensating for any losses. One officer's fountain pen was lost, and he was compensated with 100,000 legal tender. A certain officer had three gold bars (weighing more than two taels) which he had hidden away for fear of losing them when he first joined the regiment. Later, they were found and handed over to the regimental headquarters for safekeeping. When they were returned to him upon his departure, he was moved to tears and said: "I thought these taels of gold had been confiscated. Even if I had been given a receipt, I wouldn't have believed it. I never expected that they would be returned to me. The Communist Party really keeps its word." When the People's Liberation Army officers headed south, our cadres saw them off to the north bank of the Yellow River. When they boarded the boat, they were reluctant to part, and many shed tears silently. They waved goodbye until the boat reached the middle of the river.

    Many of the officers released this time were not only lieutenants, but also many colonels; not only from miscellaneous troops, but also a considerable proportion from Chiang's direct line troops (such as the 3rd Reorganized Division); not only military cadres, but also political personnel, including many members of the special agent organization "People's Service Corps." This shows the leniency of the People's Liberation Army. As long as the captured officers abandon their anti-people stance, they are treated with a kind attitude. These facts not only expose Chiang's lies and deceptions about the People's Liberation Army setting up "assassinations," "live burials," and "forced conscription," but also clarify the captured officers' doubts about our policies and dispel the wrong estimate that People's Liberation Army "neither kills, nor releases, nor uses" captured officers. Therefore, after this large batch of officers graduated, not only the new officers, but even those who had not studied well in the past and continued to train, had very high morale, vowing to study hard and hoping to graduate soon to serve the people.

　　军区各教导团执行宽大政策
  　释放两千被俘军官
  　并按路程远近发给足够旅费
    【本报特讯】军区消息：为了执行我军宽大政策，帮助被俘蒋军军官脱离内战苦海，及答复军官们为摧垮蒋家反动统治建立独立、民主的新中国而斗争的要求，我军区自今年六月以后到八月底止陆续学成毕业的解放军官中，自动参加解放军工作者为四百三十二名，入我军政学校继续学习而愿留我军工作者为三百十四名，不愿再给蒋党当炮灰，但为家庭眷属所累不得已仍回蒋管区原籍者，共达二千一百八十三名，其余的是家在解放区的也已回家安生。
    六月初以来，在我各军区教导团学习之解放军官不断毕业。六月七日，军区某教导团首先举行毕业典礼，解放军官自己布置会场，展览过去学习成绩，陈列了许多过去企图开小差伪造的假路条、隐藏的证件及党证，对个人阶级及历史的坦白材料及退出国民党的声明书等，琳琅满目，明确的显示出他们的思想进步过程。这些过去他们讳莫如深的东西，现在都自动拿出来了。
    太行太岳的解放军官们，在隆重的毕业典礼后举行丰盛的会餐。我干部亲自参加招待，为祝他们平安回家而干杯。按路程的远近，都领到多少不等的路费，有多至法币数十万元者。太岳教导团参军军官临走前与我干部开话别会，由于过去相处情感的融洽，不少军官惜别而落泪。
    某教导团解放军官毕业时，团部发还代他们保存的财物时，不仅物归原主，有损失的亦给予赔偿。一个军官的钢笔丢了，赔法币十万元。某军官的三条金子（重二两多）刚入团时因怕没收藏了起来，后被查出交团部保存，临走时发还了他，他感动得落泪说：“这几两金子我以为是被没收了，纵然给我收条，我也不信，想不到会退给我，共产党真是说话算话。”解放军官们向南走时，我干部送到黄河北岸，他们上船时别情依依，不少的人潜然泪下，船到河心了他们还挥手作别。
    这次被释的军官很多，不仅有尉级军官，而且也有不少校级军官；不仅有杂牌部队的，而且蒋嫡系部队的（如整三师的）也占了相当比重。不仅有军事干部，而且有政治人员，即特务组织“人民服务总队”的队员亦有多人被释。这可见人民解放军的宽大，只要被俘军官放弃反人民立场，无不以与人为善的态度对待。这些事实，不仅揭破了蒋贼说解放军设“暗杀”、“活埋”、“强迫参军”种种造谣欺骗，而且也澄清了被俘军官对我政策的疑虑，消除了解放军官“不杀不放不用”的错误估计。因之，在这次大批军官毕业之后，不仅新来军官，即使过去学习不好继续锻炼的也好，学习情绪都非常高涨，发誓要好好学习，希望很快学好毕业来为人民服务。（花淳）
