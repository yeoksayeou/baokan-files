How to Lead the Participating Masses
    He Xiang Wen Da
    During the Jinnan Campaign, each county's participation work had many innovations, which are introduced below:
    (I) Several issues that counties, districts, and villages should continue to pay attention to:
    Experience has shown that the rear area masses should pay great attention to solving the production difficulties of the families of participating masses. If this problem is solved well, the participating masses will have high morale; conversely, no matter how hard the participating cadres work in leading the laborers, they will feel difficulty. Qinshui worked hard in this regard, so no one ran away in two months of participation, and the same was true in Fushan.
    How to take care of the production of participating laborers? Various places have the following methods: First, the unification of work points and labor tickets. In Fushan and Qinshui, production at home is equivalent to one point, while participation in the war outside is worth an extra two li, or the targets for taking care of the production of each family are determined before the participating masses set off, so that they can feel at ease as soon as they leave. Second, after the participating masses complete their tasks and return home, labor tickets should be settled in a timely manner, and both labor and grain can be returned. This is the universal demand of the vast participating masses. Third, if there are no mutual aid groups in the new district, administrative supervision should be used to solve the problem. Secondly, the government and the masses must send comfort groups or mass representatives in a timely manner to comfort the front line in person, bring home letters to tell them about the production situation at home, and what the village hopes he will do in the front. Doing so is very effective. The morale of the laborers in Anze and Yangcheng used to be uneasy, and many people wanted to go home to see their production. Just as the comfort groups from each county arrived at the front, bringing many home letters, the morale of the laborers immediately stabilized, and from this, they enthusiastically discussed how to continue to perform meritorious service. After that, the morale of the laborers never fluctuated greatly. In addition, attention should also be paid to the ability and prestige of cadres. It is best for the county magistrate (positive or deputy) or section chief of each county to directly lead the laborers of the whole county. Yangcheng was personally led by County Magistrate Zhang Tianyi, which solved many problems and consolidated participation. As for district and village cadres, they should pay attention to avoiding mutual agency and concurrent positions, so as not to make the task difficult to implement. At the same time, it cannot be ignored that epidemic prevention and health work are important. Ideally, there should be a doctor for every 133 people in the laborer organization. The main treatment is acupuncture, followed by necessary pills, powders, and elixirs. According to this experience, the number of sick laborers suffering from dysentery, malaria, cholera, colds, and falls reached 15 to 30 percent of the total number of people. Without doctors, it would be impossible to deal with so many patients. Finally, clerks and cooks should also be appointed, otherwise it will increase everyone's fatigue. According to general experience, there should be a clerk for every 30 people, and a cook for every 10 people, so as not to increase everyone's fatigue.
    (II) Experience in leading participating masses:
    First of all, it is about ideological education. The most basic thing is to raise class consciousness and mobilize the masses to speak out about their grievances. Old districts can adopt the method of recalling the past, and recognize the significance of participation in the war from the complaints. Some emancipated masses speak out negatively due to lack of labor, but after speaking out about their grievances, they realize that "landlords are the roots of Chiang Kai-shek, and Chiang Kai-shek is the head of the landlords," and the problem is solved. After Fushan spoke out about their grievances, the phenomenon of participating masses running away was completely eradicated. The basic masses who participated in the war in Jiang County became activists in the land reform. The newcomers felt that the original participating masses understood many principles and made great progress. Everyone regarded participation in the war as a training class, and they called the glorious certificate of participation a graduation diploma; secondly, they should constantly spread the news of victory and organize the masses to discuss it, point out the future of victory, and encourage everyone's enthusiasm to achieve thoroughness. Third, mutual assistance, friendship, and unity education should be carried out, which is even more important in difficult environments. This kind of education is most effective for farmers who are away from their hometowns for the first time, especially for the wounded, the sick, and the weak.
    In terms of education methods, in addition to meetings, lectures, and discussions, the most effective method is to compile various teaching materials and model figures or deeds into ditties and clapper talks, and spread them among the masses, so that these ditties and clapper talks are widely popular among the masses. This kind of dissemination is fast and also becomes cultural entertainment, enlivening the mood.
    In addition, the quality of life is very important to the morale and physical strength of the participating masses. Some counties only pay attention to saving money and only eat rice every day without vegetables, resulting in many sick people. On the contrary, Fushan paid attention to improving life. In addition to the supplies provided, they engaged in some production during the rest period, and the public and private were clearly distinguished. The life was very good, with meat several times a month, the fewest sick people, and high morale. Therefore, one should not simply save money and affect the work. At the same time, someone should check the sleeping situation every night, especially since most laborers sleep in the open air due to the hot weather and are easily susceptible to cold. This should be checked at any time to ensure that they are covered well, so as not to get sick and tired; if they are already sick or there are a large number of sick people, they should be treated in a concentrated manner to avoid affecting participation. The best way is to separate the types of sick people, and doctors treat them collectively, which can not only give play to the doctor's expertise, but also study and improve business.
    Life should be tense and regular, getting up, washing, and exercising on time to activate physical strength and do some necessary military education at the same time. Eating, meeting, attending classes, playing games, and sleeping can also improve the morale of the laborers, increase knowledge, and cultivate the habit of collective life.
    (III) From commending models to promoting the general, to challenge competitions, launch a meritorious service campaign.
    The challenge competition meritorious service plan was initially unacceptable to the general masses, and even if the leadership did it, it was just a formality. According to experience, pay attention to commending activists at the beginning, preferably once every ten days or eight days, and then elect models for commendation. When the masses really elect models, the masses will pay attention; and only the models elected by the masses will be honored by everyone. After having models, we can establish a banner and direction for the masses to learn from, and on this basis, we can use the existing activists as the backbone to launch a competition for meritorious service. After this commendation, most of the counties had 90 percent of the people making meritorious service plans, and they were implemented very well; if the meritorious service plan was made at the beginning, it would mostly become a formality. In each battle, there are many heroic model deeds among the participating masses, and we should seize the gaps to evaluate the merits. The evaluation methods vary from county to county. Some record scores according to the performance table, and some evaluate according to each person's overall performance. In the law of merit evaluation, the beginning is generally not very attentive, and almost all are meritorious ministers. Later, in the merit comparison, some improved and some declined. At this time, everyone became particularly serious.
    The task of the leadership is to correct various incorrect personal ideas based on the actual thinking of the masses, establish righteousness, and carry forward the spirit of selflessness; in addition, the outstanding or first-class meritorious ministers selected must be the direction of the participating masses, so we cannot only look at one thing, but look at the whole picture. After the merit evaluation, some masses reviewed "Knowing this way of merit evaluation, I shouldn't have eaten the green onions of the common people, and shouldn't have defecated everywhere, etc." This is a great education for the masses. Secondly, the commendation and encouragement of meritorious ministers should not be relaxed. In this collective meritorious service, the counties awarded banners by the Logistics Headquarters were: Zhaocheng, Jiang County, and Fushan; the districts and villages that won the award banners were the third and fourth districts of Qinshui and the Feiling Village of Anze. The tasks between counties are different, so the standards are also inconsistent. Generally, the county rewards and commends, and the special ones are issued meritorious service certificates by the Logistics Headquarters. Jiang County issued a glorious "Participation Certificate" to each person, writing the advantages and achievements of the participants on it, which is of great educational significance to the participating masses next time. What is worth promoting is the cultural method of the masses in Jiang County, which is that the original laborers tell the new laborers about their experiences and precautions. Let the new laborers immediately know how to work hard, so the Logistics Headquarters awarded Jiang County the award banner of "Model of Participation in the New District".
    (IV) Helping the local masses in production and strictly enforcing mass discipline.
    Due to the long gaps in the war, the laborers of each county actively and freely helped the local masses in production, helping to turn the land, plow the land, plant the land, thresh the land, cut grass, cut wheat, and cut alfalfa, etc., covering more than 10,000 mu, an average of two mu per participating laborer, and carried out the full tank campaign as soon as they arrived in one place, cleaning the streets and checking discipline. Because the mass discipline was implemented better, the masses made good meals for the laborers when they left. The local masses reflected, "Your base is good. The laborers don't have soldiers to watch them, and they don't run away! The central army locks the laborers in the house, and they will all run away!" "The Eighth Route Army is good, and the people are just as good." This has created favorable conditions for publicity. However, there are also many individual backward elements who burn the firewood of the villagers indiscriminately. If these problems are not paid attention to, it will have a great political impact on us. Therefore, mass discipline is a problem that everyone should pay attention to. Also, due to good discipline and helping the masses in production, they are loved by the local masses. This is also a great encouragement to consolidate the morale of the laborers, making everyone feel the glory of being supported by the people and the honor of serving the people.
    In addition, necessary military education must be carried out. Generally, such as air defense concealment, marching communication, passing passwords, using terrain, assembling in formation, etc., and then rehearse their own operations according to different tasks, such as how the stretcher should be carried so that the wounded will suffer less pain. There are also many experiences in this regard: such as walking fast with small steps for serious injuries; walking fast with wide steps for minor injuries; head injuries facing forward, uphill head facing forward, downhill head facing backward. How to prevent moisture when transporting ammunition, etc., should be carried out in the field.
    (V) Leadership method:
    Mass participation is an arduous task, and leading this work is also an arduous task. Therefore, the leading cadres must first take the lead, endure hardship first, enjoy happiness later, and in times of danger, they should influence the masses with exemplary actions that do not avoid danger, especially village cadres. For example, Shi Guandeng, the model squad leader of Jiang County, usually helped the sick, worked hard in front, and cared about everyone's life. During the war, he personally went to the front to deliver ammunition and think of ways for the masses. He returned four or five times through enemy fire threats, and as a result, he completed the task best. No one in the entire squad deserted or got lost. Secondly, pay attention to cultivating active elements and backbones, promptly understand the thoughts and emotions of the masses, relieve ideological concerns, and grasp the leadership principle of more commendation and less punishment. It is worth mentioning the combination of political mobilization and disciplinary orders, because the completion of the participation task is mainly on the battlefield. The situation at that time does not allow us to solve everyone's thinking, and it is also impossible to solve all the thinking. Therefore, in addition to improving the political awareness of the masses and encouraging their emotions, they must also develop the habit of obeying orders. In wartime, on the one hand, they must rely on their own courage and composure to give the masses ideas, think of ways, and support them; on the other hand, they must have organization to listen to orders. When the situation is urgent and the masses are afraid, the leader's attitude and orders are very important. For example, the Qinshui Squadron was digging fortifications in Nanguan, and the enemy rushed out. Due to the composure and wit of the squadron leader, everyone did not run away, and no one was injured. On the contrary, running around would cause casualties. (Taiyue Branch)

　　怎样带领参战群众
    鹤祥　文达
    在晋南战役中，各县参战工作都有很多的创造，兹介绍于后：
    （一）县区村应继续注意的几个问题：
    经验证明，后方群众应大力注意解决参战群众的家庭生产困难，这一问题解决的好，参战群众就情绪高；反之，不管参战干部在带领民夫的工作上怎样努力，也会感到困难。沁水在这方面努力了，因而参战两月无一人逃跑，浮山也是如此。
    如何照顾参战民夫的生产，各地有如下办法：一、工票、差票之统一。浮山、沁水均是在家生产顶一分，在外参战多顶二厘或在参战群众未出发前即把照顾各该家庭生产的对象确定好，使之一出发就安心。二、参战群众任务完成回家后，应及时结算差工票，还工还粮均可。这是广大参战群众的普遍要求。三、新区如无互助组，应由行政上督促解决。其次政府和群众须适时的派出慰问团或群众代表。亲上前线进行慰问，带上家信告诉他们家中的生产情形，及村里希望他在前方做些什么。这样做，收效很大。安泽、阳城的民夫情绪过去呈现不安，许多人想回家看自己的生产。适值各该县的慰问团到了前方，带来了不少家信，民夫情绪马上安定了，并由此而热烈的讨论如何继续立功的问题，此后的民夫情绪，从未发生过大的波动。此外，还应注意干部的能力与威信，最好各县县长（正或副）或科长直接率领全县民夫，阳城由张天乙县长亲自带领，解决了不少问题，巩固了参战。至于区村干部，则应注意避免互相代理兼职，免得任务不易贯澈。同时不可不注意的是防疫卫生工作，民夫组织中最好是一百三十三个人即有一个医生，主要治疗是刺针，其次是必要的丸、散、丹之类的药品。根据这次经验，民夫中生病痢疾、虐疾、霍乱、感冒、跌伤，竟达总人数的百分之十五到三十，如果没有医生，对这许多病人，将是无法处理的。最后事务员及伙夫也应有一定的人担任，否则是会影响工作。根据一般经验，三十个人须要一个事务员，十个人应有一个伙夫才不至于增加大家的疲劳。
    （二）带领参战群众的经验：
    首先是关于思想教育，最基本的是提高阶级觉悟，发动群众诉苦，老区可采用回忆过去的方式，从诉苦中认识参战的意义。有些翻身群众，因缺乏劳力说二话，但经过诉苦后，认识了“地主是蒋介石的根，蒋介石是地主的头”，问题便得到解决。浮山经过诉苦，参战群众的逃跑现象就此根绝。绛县参战回去的基本群众，成为土改中的积极分子，新来的人觉得原来的参战群众都懂了许多道理，进步很大，大家把参战看成是个训练班，他们把光荣参战证明书叫作毕业文凭；其次是时常传播胜利消息，并组织群众讨论，指出胜利的前途，鼓舞起大家的劲头达到如何彻底的目的。第三、应进行互助友爱团结教育，这在艰苦的环境里边更重要。特别对伤员病号及力弱的人，更须注意这样的一种教育，对于初次远离家乡的农民作用最大。
    在教育的方式上，除开会讲解讨论外，最有效的办法是把各种教材及模范人物或事绩编成小调快板，传播到群众中去，使这种小调快板广泛的流行在群众中，这样传播既快、同时又成为了文化娱乐，活跃情绪。
    另外生活好坏，对参战群众的情绪、体力关系都很大。有些县里只注意节约，每天只吃米，不吃菜，结果病号很多。相反浮山注意了改善生活，除了下的给养外，在休整期间，作些生产，公私分明，生活很好，每月吃几次肉，病号最少，情绪也高，因之不应单纯节约，而影响了工作。同时对于睡觉，每晚也应有人检查，特别是由于天热，大部民夫露天睡容易受凉，这应随时检查，盖好盖的，免得生病受累；如已生病或发生大批病号，即应突击治疗，免得影响参战。最好的办法，是把病号种类分开，医生集体治疗，这样既能发挥医生之专长，也能互相研究提高业务。
    生活要紧张，有规律，按时起床、洗脸、出操，一面活动体力，一面作些必要的军事教育。吃饭、开会、上课、游戏、睡觉，同样可提高民夫情绪，增加知识，锻炼集体生活的习惯。
    （三）从表扬模范推动一般，到挑战竞赛，展开立功运动。
    挑战竞赛立功计划，开始一般的群众接受不了，即使领导上做了，也是形式。根据经验，开始注意表扬积极分子，十天八天最好进行一次，然后选举模范，进行表扬。真正让群众选举模范时，群众就会注意；也只有群众选举的模范，大家才都会光荣。有了模范之后，才能树立起群众学习的旗帜和方向，在这个基础上，以旧有的积极分子为骨干，即可展开竞赛立功。这次大部县经过表扬后，都是百分之九十的人订了立功计划，而且贯澈的都很好；如开始即订立功计划，大都流于形式。每个战役，参战群众中都有许多英勇模范事迹，应抓紧空隙进行评功。评的办法各县不一，有的按成绩表记订分数，有的按各人全部表现评。在评功的规律上，开始一般的不很注意，差不多都是功臣，后来在比功中有的提高，有的下降，这时大家才特别认真起来。
    领导上的任务是根据群众思想实际，纠正各种不正确的个人想法，树立正气，发扬大公无私的精神；另外在选出的特等或一等功臣中，必须是参战群众的方向，所以不能单看一件事，而要看全面。评功后，有的群众检讨“知道这样评功，不该拔吃老百姓的葱，不该到处大便等等”，这对群众是个很大的教育。其次对功臣的表扬与鼓励，也不可放松。这次集体立功中，经后勤司令部奖给锦旗的，县有：赵城、绛县、浮山；区村得奖旗的有沁水的三、四区，安泽的飞岭村。县与县之间任务不同，所以标准也不一致，一般的由县奖励表扬，特殊好的由后勤司令部发给功臣奖状，绛县发给每人一张光荣“参战证明书”，把参战者的优点及成绩都写在上面，这样对下次参战群众的教育意义很大。值得提倡的是绛县群众的文化办法，它是由原来民夫给新来民夫讲经验及注意事项。使新来民夫马上知道该如何努力，因此后勤司令部即奖给绛县“新区参战模范”的奖旗。
    （四）帮助当地群众生产中，严格群众纪律。
    由于战争空隙较长，各县民夫都积极的无代价的帮助当地群众生产，帮助翻地、犁地、种地、打场、割草、割麦、割苜蓿等约在一万亩以上，平均每一参战民夫二亩，以及每到一地即进行满缸运动，打扫街道，检查纪律，由于群众纪律执行的较好，民夫临走，群众给民夫作好饭，当地群众反映说：“你们根据地就是好，民夫没兵看，也不跑！中央军把民夫锁到房子里，也要跑光！”“八路军好，尽管的老百姓也这样好。”这就造成了宣传的有利条件。但也有不少的个别落后分子，乱烧老乡柴，这些问题如不注意，对我之政治影响很大，所以群众纪律是一般的都应注意的问题，又因由于良好纪律和帮助群众生产，而受到当地群众的爱戴，这对巩固民夫情绪上，也是很大的鼓励，使每人感到人民拥护的光荣，和为人民服务的荣誉。
    此外还须进行必要的军事教育。一般的如防空隐蔽，行军联络、传口令、利用地形、集合站队等，再根据不同任务演习自己的作业，如担架怎样走伤员才会减少痛苦。这也有很多经验：如重伤走快脚步小；轻伤快走迈开步；头部负伤头朝前，上坡头朝前，下坡头朝后。运输弹药如何防潮等等，都应进行实地演习。
    （五）领导方法：
    群众参战是个艰苦任务，领导这一工作也是个艰苦工作。所以领导干部首先是以身作则，吃苦在前，享福在后，危险时更应以不避危难的模范行动去影响群众，特别是村干部更应如此。如绛县模范分队长史观登，平时帮助病号，劳动在前，关心大家生活。战时亲身到前边送弹药，给群众想办法，通过敌火力威胁往返四、五次，结果完成任务最好，全分队没有一个逃亡或走散的。其次注意培养积极分子骨干，及时的了解群众思想情绪，解除思想顾虑，掌握多表扬少处分的领导原则。值得提出的是政治动员与纪律命令的结合问题，因为参战任务的完成，主要是在战场上，当时情况不允许我们解决所有人的思想，同时也不可能全部思想得到解决，所以除平时提高群众的政治觉悟、鼓舞其情绪外，还要养成服从命令的习惯，在战时一面靠自己的勇敢沉着，给群众出主意、想办法，撑腰壮胆；另方面必须有组织听命令，当情况紧急、群众恐惧的时候，领导者的态度命令都很重要，如沁水中队在南关挖工事，敌人冲出来，由于中队长的沉着机智，大家没跑，也没一人受到损失；相反的因乱跑则会受到伤亡。（太岳分社）
