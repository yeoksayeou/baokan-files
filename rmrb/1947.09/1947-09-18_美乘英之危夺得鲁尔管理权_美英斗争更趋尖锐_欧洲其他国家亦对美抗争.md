　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th: Comprehensive reports: The Anglo-American Washington Ruhr coal production conference, which had been delayed for a month, has finally forced the British representatives to yield to American power. On the 10th, London and Washington simultaneously announced the Anglo-American Ruhr talks agreement, declaring: (1) The United States will acquire the British management rights over the Ruhr coal mines on an "equal footing"; (2) Britain will postpone its nationalization plan, and the ownership of the Ruhr coal mines will remain with their original owners (80 percent of which belong to Germans); (3) The United States will provide US$25 million worth of steel within the next six months to maintain and repair mine equipment; (4) Efforts will be made to improve Ruhr coal production with American technology, so that it can increase production to more than 400,000 tons per day by the end of next year. However, according to various sources, the United States has taken advantage of Britain's deep economic crisis to seize the Ruhr Administration, which will result in an increasingly acute struggle between Britain and the United States for control of the Ruhr, and will arouse resistance from other European countries against the United States. According to an Agence France-Presse report on the 11th, Londoners made "unfavorable criticisms" of this and feared that "the control of German steel factories and international trade will gradually fall into the hands of the United States." The Netherlands and Luxembourg, which hold partial property rights in the Ruhr coal mines, are deeply disturbed by the US-British agreement. Luxembourg Prime Minister Dupong declared on the 11th: "We hope to obtain compensation from Germany without suffering losses"; and stated that the control of the Ruhr should be jointly decided by the six countries of Britain, the United States, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg. The Netherlands also sent notes to Britain and the United States on the 11th, requesting that "Dutch interests" be protected.

　　美乘英之危夺得鲁尔管理权
  　美英斗争更趋尖锐
  　欧洲其他国家亦对美抗争
    【新华社陕北十四日电】综合报导：拖延一月之久的英美华府鲁尔煤产会议，顷已迫使英国代表屈膝于美国之威力下。十日，伦敦与华府同时公布英美鲁尔会谈之协议，宣布：（一）美国将以“对等地位”取得英国对鲁尔煤矿的管理权；（二）英国延搁其国有化计划，即将鲁尔煤矿的所有权仍归其原来主人（其中百分之八十属于德国人）；（三）今后半年内由美国提供两千五百万美元的钢以保持与修复矿井装备；（四）尽力以美国技术改进鲁尔煤产，使其能于明年年底增加产量至每日四十万吨以上。但是据各方消息透露：美国趁英国经济之深重危机而攫取了鲁尔管理局，结果将促使英美争夺鲁尔的斗争益趋尖锐，并引起欧洲其他国家对美国的抗争。据法新社十一日讯，伦敦人士对此作了“不佳的批评”，且恐惧“德国钢铁工厂和国际贸易的控制，将逐渐落入美国之手。”在鲁尔煤矿中握有部分产权的荷兰与卢森堡，对美英协议深感不安。卢首相杜邦十一日宣称：“我们希望从德国取得赔偿，而不遭受损失”；且表示：鲁尔的管制应由英、美、法、比、荷、卢六国联合决定。荷兰十一日亦照会英美两国，要求维护“荷兰的利益”。
