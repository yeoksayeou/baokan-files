    Poor Peasants in Jing County Investigate Old Accounts: Metamorphosed Landlord Reveals Ugly Form

    [Our newspaper's report from Southern Hebei on the 25th] "Investigate the old accounts, check the class status," revealed a metamorphosed landlord. Liu Weizhang and Liu Weiqing, brothers and landlords from Longxing Village, Third District, Jing County, owned two qing of land in the past and have always ruled the entire village. In order to continue to control village affairs, Liu Weizhang served as the accountant of the village office. During the mass movement last year, in order to conceal his landlord status and escape struggle, he deliberately participated in labor, and on the one hand, pretended to work actively, using personal feelings to win over some backward village cadres. During this re-investigation, the masses and village cadres had a very vague understanding of him, and only took out seven or eight mu of land and that was it. The work team raised the issue of investigating old accounts and checking class status in the poor peasant groups, and each group began to deliberate. The Su Xitang group said: "When you mention old accounts, we understand. His family's famous 'Harmony' brand was one of the best in our street. At the time of the incident, he still had more than two qing of land. In the past two years, he saw that the poor people were about to turn over, so he sold land, pretended to work, and participated in the peasant association, pretending to be a middle peasant. Look at what he eats, wears, and lives in, does that look anything like us? We must give him fire and ice together and resolutely fight him again." All groups unanimously proposed: "This time, we must fight him until he reveals his true colors!" The masses' thinking was cleared, but some village cadres still believed that he had contributed to the office. After in-depth mobilization, they admitted their right-leaning tendencies and launched a struggle against the landlord Liu Weizhang. Li Xiang, a landlord from Xiaoying, Sixth District, Linzhang, had pawned or sold more than one qing of land before the mass movement, scattering it all. He ran a music shop, and if he treated cadres for illness, he didn't charge for medicine. He would say to people on the street: "Comrade ×× is on good terms with me." Therefore, he was able to sneak into the peasant association, running around and pretending to be active. When distributing the fruits of victory and determining class status, he insisted on distributing the fruits of victory according to the poor peasant standard. At that time, the masses said one after another: "Li Xiang doesn't have any land now, how can he be considered a poor person?" Some said: "He exploited us two years ago, we have to settle accounts with him." The unanimous opinion was to detain Li Xiang and first clear out his hidden wealth. On the same day, they found a large gun, a pistol, 1,700 silver dollars, and 40 shi of grain (including 30 shi that were almost rotten into mud), and several boxes of clothes from his house. Many people became even more angry when they saw these things of his, and said: "The landlord is really hateful! He even rots his own grain and competes with the poor for grain."

    景县贫农查老帐
    化形地主现丑形
    【本报冀南二十五日电】“查老帐、看成份”，查出化形地主。景县三区隆兴村地主刘维章、刘维清弟兄二人，过去有地两顷，历来统治全村。刘维章为继续掌握村政，任村公所司帐员。去年群运时，为掩饰其地主面目、逃避斗争，故意参加劳动，一面假装积极工作，利用私人感情，拉拢一些落后村干。这次复查中，群众、村干都对他认识很模糊，只拿出七八亩地就完了。工作队在贫农小组中提出查老帐看成份，各组酝酿起来。苏西堂小组里说：“提起老帐，咱明白了，他家有名的‘和顺’字号，在咱街上是数一数二的户，事变时还有两顷多地，这二年他看到受穷人要翻身，又是卖地，又是装干活，又是参加农会，充中农、看他吃的、穿的、住的，那一点象咱呢？咱给他冰火不同炉，得坚决重斗。”各组一致提出：“这回非斗的他露出原形不可！”群众思想打通了，但部分村干仍认为他办公有功。经深入动员，才承认了自己右倾，遂向地主刘维章展开斗争。临漳六区小营地主李香，群运前把一顷多地，有的典当、有的出卖，都疏散开。他开着乐铺，凡给干部治病，吃点药不要钱。在街上逢人便说：“××同志都和我相好。”因此得以混入农会，他跑前跑后，假充积极。当分果实评定成份时，他硬要按贫农分果实，当时群众纷纷提出：“李香这才没地，能算穷人？”有的说：“前二年他还剥削咱哩，这咱总得给他算算帐。”一致意见扣起李香，先清浮财。当天从他家弄出大枪一支，手枪一支，银元一千七百块，四十石粮食（内有三十石快沤成泥了），衣服数箱。很多群众见到他这些东西，更加气愤，都说：“地主真可恨！把自己的粮食都沤啦，还给穷人争粮食。”
