(Our newspaper's report from Southern Hebei on the 22nd) In late August, the ninth district of Wei County suffered continuous gales and torrential rains, affecting thirty-four villages throughout the district. Crops were damaged, and according to the masses, the lost grain "wouldn't be enough to cover the public grain quota!" A total of 11,105 mu of crops were flooded, with water depths reaching four chi in some places. The leadership mobilized efforts to drain and salvage the harvest. In three days, six villages salvaged 1,200 mu of crops from the mud. The Zhuang village mobilized all 220 people aged ten to fifty, with each person salvaging half a mu per day. Village Chief Xiao Liang personally organized eleven mutual aid teams, with specific divisions of labor. 150 people were dedicated to working in the water, using ladders tied to door panels, with some people撈的撈 (scooping?) and some冲的衝 (rinsing?). Women, children, and the elderly were responsible for moving, drying, and delivering food. In one day, all 500 mu of flooded land were harvested. Under the leadership of An Jingwen and Li Qiao, 320 women in Ganji built a dike four chi high, six chi wide, and nine zhang long in half a day. Thirty-six women salvaged nine mu of millet and sorghum, influencing more than 200 poor peasant households in the entire town to spontaneously organize and salvage the harvest. Chengcun Village, being closest to the river, built a more than two li long wall, preventing the entire village from being flooded. In Chengu Village, nine major roads were flooded. Labor hero Liu Jinshan solved the problem of transporting crops by carts during the autumn harvest by demolishing wall heads and changing small roads into large roads.
