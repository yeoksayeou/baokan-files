Xinhua News Agency, Jin察冀 (Jin-Cha-Ji) 16th Telegram: In coordination with the overall large-scale counter-offensive, the Jin-Cha-Ji Liberation Army, after recovering Xin Town on the bank of the Daqing River on the 9th, destroyed the strong fortification line of the Chiang bandits along the Daqing River and crossed the river to carry out suppression. After two days and nights of fierce fighting, Xiong County was recovered. Two battalions of the 94th Division of the 16th Army of the bandits and more than 100 members of the Xin Town puppet security police were annihilated. In addition to those killed and wounded, more than 1,000 bandits including the deputy battalion commander and below were captured, and 15 infantry guns, mortars, and 60 mortars, 6 anti-tank guns, 63 light and heavy machine guns, and more than 800 rifles were seized. Xiong County was the first county town invaded and occupied by the bandit army that had sneaked north across the Daqing River on the 6th of last month.

Xinhua News Agency, Jin察冀 (Jin-Cha-Ji) 16th Telegram: Delayed news: A unit of the Jin-Cha-Ji Liberation Army captured Songlindian, an important stronghold of the Chiang bandits south of Zhuozhou County on the Pinghan Railway, on the 6th, and all the bandits guarding the area were annihilated. On the 7th, the Liberation Army again attacked the periphery of the river, recovering bandit strongholds such as Shilipo, Nanguobu, and Nanbeiyizhuang, and once captured the east and south gates of Laishui. Two companies of the 13th Regiment of the 5th Division of the 94th Army of the bandits were annihilated. In this battle, more than 500 bandits were killed or wounded, and more than 300 were captured.

Xinhua News Agency, Jin察冀 (Jin-Cha-Ji) 16th Telegram: From the end of July to the beginning of this month, according to incomplete statistics from various lines in Jin-Cha-Ji, a total of more than 2,300 Chiang, Yan, and Fu bandit troops were killed, wounded, or captured. After the Liberation Army captured and successively recovered Xiong County on the 9th, the Chiang bandits' attempt to ensure the Pingjinbao (Beijing-Tianjin-Baoding) triangular area has been seriously hit. For more than a month, the focus of the struggle in this area has been on the Pingjinbao triangular area. On the 6th of last month, the entire 16th Army of the Chiang bandits (missing one regiment), two regiments of the 43rd Division of the 94th Army, and local puppet bandits totaling more than 30,000 people invaded the area in several routes, and successively invaded and occupied Xiong County, Yongqing, Baxian, Xin Town and other places on the 6th, 7th, and 8th. The local armed forces and militia of the Liberation Army persisted in fighting fiercely from the suburbs of Beiping in the north to the bank of the Daqing River in the south, blocking and annihilating the bandit army everywhere. The local armed forces of Daxing repelled the offensive of two regiments of bandits several times in mid-last month, annihilating more than 80 of them. The armed peasants who had been liberated in various counties won five battles and five victories on the Pingda (name) highway near Niutuo (north of Ba County), also annihilating more than 80 of them. As of the 9th of this month, the local armed forces and militia in the area had annihilated a total of more than 920 Chiang bandits. At the same time, the local armed forces and militia of the Liberation Army on both sides of the Chaonan and Pinghan lines, in order to cooperate with the anti-"mopping up" operation north of the Daqing River, launched a wide-ranging attack on Chaonan, PingSui, and PingHan in mid-last month, also annihilating more than 900 Chiang and Fu bandit troops, and destroying three bandit military vehicles. The Pingbao (Beijing-Baoding) transportation has been cut off. For more than a month, the guerrilla warfare along the Beining line between Pingjin (Beijing-Tianjin) and the outskirts of Shijiazhuang and Taiyuan has also been active. On the 1st of this month, a certain local armed force in Jizhong killed or wounded more than 30 bandit troops near Rongcheng on the outskirts of Baoding. The puppet bandits in Yindingzhuang and Shangzha, two strongholds east of Baoding, were also driven out. After the Yan bandits invaded Shouyang City in the western section of Zhengtai last month, the local army and people also rose up to attack the enemy, annihilating more than 70 bandits near Lingjing on August 31.
