Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 14th. The Chiang bandit's direct line, the Reorganized 57th Division, annihilated in Shatuji, Luxi, was formerly the Assault Regiment of the 32nd Army of the Third War Area under Zhu Tong. It was initially commanded by Li Mo'an and formed in 1941 under the guidance of Dennis, the head of the British Military Delegation to China. It was equipped with British weapons, which aroused the jealousy of Chiang Kai-shek's American father, and American supplies were stopped. From 1944, this unit continuously attacked our New Fourth Army's Zhejiang East Column, and in June 1945, it was almost completely annihilated by the New Fourth Army in the Xindeng and Xiaofeng areas. In September 1945, it was renamed the 98th Army, under the jurisdiction of the 123rd Division and the 124th Division, and later renamed the Provisional 3rd Division and the Provisional 4th Division, and changed to Japanese equipment. In December of the same year, under the internal war deployment of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits, the army passed through Jinghu and headed north to Xuzhou and Haizhou. The 117th Division, originally under the 97th Army, was assigned to the division. In March 1946, it was reorganized into the 57th Division. Its Provisional 3rd Brigade was completely annihilated in the Subei campaign in December. Its Provisional 4th Brigade was renamed the 60th Brigade this year (using the number of the 60th Brigade of the annihilated Chiang 69th Division). Most of the division was cowering in Haizhou. After the annihilation of the Reorganized 46th Division and the 73rd Division in the Laiwu Campaign in February this year, Chiang Kai-shek's bandits transferred the division to invade the Lunan Liberated Area. The division commander, Duan Linmao, was afraid of being annihilated if he went north, and ordered local social figures to come forward and falsely plead for them to stay. In June, the division invaded the Yilu mountainous area again. When the Liu-Deng army crossed the river to attack, the division reinforced Luxi. Although the division showed considerable combat effectiveness in previous contacts with our army, it is now in a state of low morale, coupled with Chiang Kai-shek's erroneous strategic guidance. As expected by the division commander Duan Linmao, the entire division was finally wiped out in Shatuji.

　　蒋匪五十七师介绍
    【新华社华东前线十四日电】在鲁西沙土集被歼之蒋匪嫡系整编第五十七师，其前身为祝同第三战区三十二集团军之突击总队，初由李默庵指挥，系于一九四一年在英国驻华军事代表团团长顿尼斯指导下组成，装备有英式武器，当时曾引起蒋匪美国爸爸醋意，停上美国的供给。自一九四四年，该部即不断进攻我新四军浙东纵队，四五年六月在新登、孝丰地区几为新四军全部歼灭。四五年九月改称九十八军、辖一二三师、一二四师，后改称预三师、预四师，并改为日式装备。同年十二月在蒋匪内战部署下，该军经京沪北开徐（州）海（州）两地，原属九十七军之一一七师，拨归该师建制。四六年三月整编为五十七师，其预三旅于十二月宿（迁）北战役中已被全歼，其预四旅于今年二连改称六十旅（用被歼之蒋六十九师之六十旅番号）。该师大部蜷缩苟安于海州一线，今年二月莱芜战役整四十六师七十三师被歼后，蒋匪调该师进犯鲁南解放区时，该师师长段霖茂惧怕北上被歼，曾命令当地社会人士出面伪作挽留，六月间该师复进犯沂鲁山区。刘邓大军渡河出击，该师又增援鲁西，在与我军历次接触中，该虽表现相当战斗力，但现因士气衰颓，与蒋介石的战略指导错误，果不出该师师长段霖茂所料，终于在纱土集全师覆没。
