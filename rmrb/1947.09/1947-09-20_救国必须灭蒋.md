　　The September 18th Incident is upon us again. The suffering Chinese people can never forget this day of suffering. Because even sixteen years later, even after the victory against Japan, not only is the new aggressor, American imperialism, threatening us, but also the old aggressor, the perpetrator of the September 18th Incident, Japanese imperialism, is about to make a comeback as a pawn of American imperialism.

　　Why is the American aggressor able to霸 occupy the land of victorious China? Why is defeated Japan able to make a comeback? Regarding the first question, we cannot help but think of Chiang Kai-shek's hateful policy of leading a wolf into the house. Regarding the second question, we especially cannot help but think of the entire history of Chiang Kai-shek's shameful relationship with Japan over the past sixteen years. In the past sixteen years, there have been three periods in Chiang-Japan relations: From the September 18th Incident in 1931 to the July 7th Incident in 1937 was the first period, characterized by non-resistance and "Sino-Japanese amity." From the July 7th Incident to the Japanese surrender in 1945 was the second period, characterized by passive resistance and "saving the nation through a roundabout way." In these two periods, the Japanese aggressors certainly bullied the Chinese people first and foremost. However, Chiang Kai-shek was also bullied quite substantially. Therefore, the Chinese people, disregarding past grievances, gave him an opportunity to redeem himself during the Xi'an Incident. Who knew that this would be a case of judging a petty man with the heart of a gentleman? The ungrateful Chiang Kai-shek still prioritized anti-communism and anti-the people; even in 1944 when the entire world was on the counter-offensive, only he was driven from Henan to Guizhou by the Japanese in one breath, causing an uproar at home and abroad, he still prioritized anti-communism and anti-the people. Until the Japanese surrender, people thought that Chiang Kai-shek this time would definitely show the prestige of one of the "Big Four Leaders" towards this dead tiger. Chiang Kai-shek's followers were especially waiting for this move to prove that all the attacks on this "national hero" were originally slanders by the "traitorous party." But precisely at this time, history made a finishing touch; Chiang Kai-shek was still anti-communist and anti-the people first. Therefore, not only did he recognize American imperialism as his new father, but he also unequivocally respected his old father—the Japanese imperialism that had already been defeated but was adopted by American imperialism—as an uncle, in order to jointly preserve the reactionary fortress in the Far East. In the past two years, the face of the Chinese people has been completely lost by Chiang Kai-shek; Chiang Kai-shek's heart has also been seen through by the Chinese people! In principle, China is a member of the Four Allied Powers' Council for Japan, and it was the country that fought Japan earliest and longest, was invaded by Japan first, was devastated most severely, and was threatened most greatly. Even if other things could be conceded in post-war international affairs, at least the thorough elimination of Japanese reactionary aggressive forces could not be conceded under any circumstances. However, Chiang Kai-shek's very first act at the time of Japan's surrender was to announce so-called tolerance and benevolence towards Japan, which was to retain Japanese troops and Japanese spies to participate in the Chinese civil war. Chiang Kai-shek still treats the number one war criminal, former "Commander-in-Chief of the China Expeditionary Army" Neiji Okamura, as an honored guest; recently, he also invited the top-level aggressors, former President of the South Manchuria Railway Yosuke Ayukawa, and former Governor of Taiwan Hasegawa, to Taiwan. And he is even more supportive of MacArthur's laissez-faire policy towards many war criminals in Japan, allowing them to be at large, even reassuming important positions. Chiang Kai-shek's "control Japan" representative is actually controlled by the United States, that is, Japan. After the Japanese police killed Chinese people in Japan, the United States announced that the Japanese were innocent and the Chinese should leave the country, and Chiang Kai-shek raised his hand in agreement; the United States asked China to allow the Japanese to come to Chinese territorial waters to fish, and Chiang Kai-shek raised his hand in agreement; the United States wanted to restore Japanese industry, and Chiang Kai-shek offered salt and other raw materials; the United States wanted Japanese industry to occupy the Chinese market, and Chiang Kai-shek forcibly passed and implemented the restoration of Sino-Japanese trade. Japanese aggressive elements, encouraged not only by MacArthur but also by Chiang Kai-shek, are becoming more and more ambitious, and now they are openly trying to control the funds of overseas Chinese in Japan, to obtain special privileges in Taiwan, and so on. Look! The infinite suffering of the sixteen years since the September 18th Incident, the countless heads during the eight years of the War of Resistance against Japan, all flowed away, this is the inevitable result of the Chinese reactionaries colluding with the American reactionaries and the Japanese reactionaries. Dog feces cannot be gilded, and there are groups of writers in Chiang Kai-shek's court who specialize in telling lies, and they are completely unable to defend this. Can the Chinese people recognize such a traitorous national traitor like Chiang Kai-shek as representing our country to discuss compensation issues and treaty issues? Can the Chinese people endure such a traitorous national traitor like Chiang Kai-shek to rule our solemn and enthusiastic great nation that defeated the aggressors? But cry as you may, scold as you may, as long as you don't eliminate Chiang Kai-shek for one day, he will still stand on the head of the Chinese people, playing his role as a traitorous national traitor. The matter is so clear! If all patriotic people in China do not want to be slaves of a conquered nation again, if they want to save themselves and save the country, they have no choice but to unite and eliminate Chiang Kai-shek, and hand over the Japanese war criminals and civil war criminals to the people for trial. There is no other way out.

　　Today, the Chinese people have made their final determination to rise up and eliminate Chiang Kai-shek. The Chinese People's Liberation Army has launched a counter-offensive to the area between the Yangtze and Huai Rivers, and the complete demise of the traitorous national traitor Chiang Kai-shek, the complete liberation of the Chinese people, and the complete independence of the Chinese nation are not far away. Today is September 18th, we look forward to the future with excitement, but looking back at the past, the harm Chiang Kai-shek has caused to our country over the past sixteen years, how many detours we have taken, how many injuries our compatriots have suffered, we cannot help but feel grief and indignation. Chiang Kai-shek, the reactionary head of the Chinese landlords and capitalists, is of course completely selfish and disregards the life and death of the country, the nation, and the people. Today, we want to ask: Chiang Kai-shek's army officers and soldiers, Chiang Kai-shek's government staff, and the ordinary members of the Kuomintang, for whom are you risking your lives today, for whom are you working so hard? You are Chinese people, Chinese blood flows in your veins, what is there to be happy about if Chiang Kai-shek succeeds in selling out the country? Chiang Kai-shek, Soong Tzu-wen, Kung Hsiang-hsi, Chen Li-fu, Zhang Qun, Chen Cheng and their cronies and relatives, corrupt officials, and local bullies have made fortunes from selling out the country, they have concentrated the blood and sweat of your elders and your compatriots, concentrated your own and your compatriots' bodies, to fight the civil war of selling out the country, what benefits are there for you? The communists are outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese nation, struggling hard and sacrificing heroically for the country and the people; after the victory of the People's Liberation Army, the only ones who will be unlucky are the American aggressors, the Japanese aggressors, and the Chinese financial groups, warlords, corrupt officials, and local bullies; what is there to be afraid of for you? For the sake of our disaster-ridden beloved motherland and beloved compatriots, for your own sake, awaken quickly, stand on the side of the people, overthrow Chiang Kai-shek as soon as possible, establish a patriotic, democratic, non-corrupt government as soon as possible, and establish an independent, free, and prosperous country. (September 18th)

### 救国必须灭蒋

　　救国必须灭蒋
    九一八又来了，苦难的中国人民，至今不能忘记这个苦难的日子。因为虽在十六年以后，虽在抗日胜利以后，不但新的侵略者美帝国主义是威胁着我们，并且老的侵略者、九一八的凶犯日本帝国主义也作为美帝国主义的爪牙，又要卷土重来了。
    美国侵略者，为什么会霸在胜利了的中国的土地上？战败国的日本，为什么又会卷土重来？对于第一个问题，我们固然不能不想到蒋介石引狼入室的可恨政策；对于第二个问题，我们尤其不能不想到十六年来蒋介石与日本可耻关系的全部历史。十六年来，蒋、日关系有三个时期：一九三一年的九一八，至一九三七年的七七，是第一期，其特点是不抵抗和“中日亲善”。七七至一九四五年的日本投降是第二期，其特点是消极抗战和“曲线救国”。在这两个时期中，日本侵略者当然首先是欺负中国人民。但是，把蒋介石也欺负得着实可观，因此中国人民，曾经不念旧恶，在西安事变的时候，给他一个将功赎罪的机会。谁知这竟是以君子之心度小人之腹，忘恩负义的蒋介石，还是反共反人民第一；甚至在一九四四年全世界都反攻了，惟有他被日本人一口气，从河南赶到贵州，中外哗然，他还是反共反人民第一。直到日本投降，人们以为蒋介石这一回对于这只死老虎定然要显一显“四大领袖之一”的威风了；蒋介石的党徒们，特别等待这一手，好证明一切对于这个“民族英雄”攻击，原来都是“奸党”的污蔑。但是偏在这时，历史来了个画龙点睛；蒋介石依然是反共反人民第一。因此之故，不但认了美帝国主义做新爸爸，而且对于他的旧爸爸——对于那个已经失败了、但又为美帝国主义所收养了的日本帝国主义，也毫不含糊地尊以叔侄之礼，以便共同保存远东的反动堡垒。这两年来，中国人民的颜面算是给蒋介石丢完了；蒋介石的心肝，也是给中国人看透了！按理说，中国是四大战胜国对日委员会的一分子，又是打日本最早最久，受日本侵略最先，摧残最惨，威胁最大的国家，对战后的国际事务，即使其他都可以让步，至少对于彻底消灭日本反动侵略势力，是万万不能让步的。但是蒋介石在日本投降时的劈头一条，就是宣布对日本的所谓宽容仁爱，就是留用日军和日本特务参加中国内战。蒋介石把第一号战犯、前“支那派遣军总司令”冈村宁次，至今奉为上宾；最近又把第一等侵略分子、前满铁总裁鲇川义介，前台湾总督长谷川请到台湾。而他对于在日本国内的许多侵华战犯，更是附和麦克阿瑟的放任政策，听其逍遥法外，甚至重踞要津。蒋介石的“管制日本”代表，实际上是为美国、亦即日本所管制。美国在日本警察打死中国人民以后，宣布日本人无罪、中国人出境，蒋介石举手赞成；美国叫中国让日本人到中国领海来捕鱼，蒋介石举手赞成；美国要恢复日本工业，蒋介石奉送食盐和其他原料；美国要日本的工业占领中国市场，蒋介石强迫通过和实行恢复中日贸易。日本侵略分子不但在麦克阿瑟、而且也在蒋介石的鼓励之下，得寸进尺，现在已经公然要控制华侨在日本的资金，要在台湾获得特权等等了。看吧！九一八以来十六年间的无限辛酸，抗日战争八年间的无数头颅，一一付之流水，这就是中国反动派跟美国反动派、日本反动派互相结合的必然结果。狗屎不能镀金，蒋介石朝廷中尽有成群的专说谎话的文人，对此完全无法辩饰。中国人民能够承认象蒋介石这样的汉奸卖国贼代表我们的国家去讨论什么赔偿问题、和约问题吗？中国人民能够忍受象蒋介石这样的汉奸卖国贼来统治我们庄严热烈战胜侵略者的伟大民族吗？但是痛哭由你痛哭，笑骂由你笑骂，只要你一天没有消灭蒋介石，他就还是站在中国人民头上，做他的汉奸卖国贼。事情就是这样明明白白！中国一切爱国人民如果不愿再当亡国奴，如果要自救救国，就只有团结起来，消灭蒋介石，把日本战犯与内战战犯，一起交给人民审判。除此以外，再无别的出路。
    中国人民今天已经下定最后决心，起来消灭蒋介石。中国人民解放军已经反攻到江淮河汉之间，眼看汉奸卖国贼蒋介石的完全覆亡，中国人民的完全解放，中华民族的完全独立，已经不远了。今天是九一八，我们展望将来，固然满怀兴奋，但是回顾过去，十六年间由于蒋介石的为害我们的国家，走了多少弯路，我们的同胞遭了多少伤残，不能不悲愤交集。蒋介石这个中国大地主、大资本家的反动头子，当然是彻底自私自利，不顾国家民族人民的死活的。我们今天要问一问：蒋介石军队的官兵，蒋介石政府的职员，国民党的普通党员们，今天究竟是为谁卖命，为谁辛苦为谁忙？你们是中国人，你们血管中流的是中国人的血，蒋介石卖国成功，对你们有什么可喜？蒋介石、宋子文、孔祥熙、陈立夫、张群、陈诚及其一批喽＠亲属、贪官污吏、土豪劣绅们发了卖国财，他们集中了你们父老和你们同胞的血汗，集中了你们自己和你们同胞的肉体，来打卖国的内战，对你们有什么好处？共产党人是中华民族的优秀儿女，为了国家和人民艰苦奋斗、英勇牺牲；人民解放军胜利以后，倒霉的只是美国侵略者，日本侵略者，中国的财阀、军阀、贪官土吏；对你们又有什么可怕？为了我们多灾多难的亲爱的祖国和亲爱的同胞，为了你们自己，快快觉悟，站到人民方面来，早早打倒蒋介石，早早建立一个爱国的、民主的、不贪污的政府，建立一个独立的自由的富强的国家。（九月十八日）
