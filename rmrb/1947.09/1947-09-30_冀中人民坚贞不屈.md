Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 28th: The Chiang Kai-shek-puppet troops rampaging in the Tianjin-Baoding triangle area are perpetrating unprecedented massacres, but the heroic and unyielding deeds of the people are also emerging endlessly. When Wulong Village in Gu'an County was surrounded by Chiang's troops in late last month, Han Zhilu, the director of the village's armed committee, was unable to retreat in time. Alone, armed with a rifle, he fought valiantly against a large enemy force for a whole day. The enemy's despicable attempts to force him to surrender and "capture him alive" were thwarted. He finally killed and wounded several enemies before heroically sacrificing himself in battle. After Qugou Town in the same county was occupied, Pang Yizhai, the town's grain director, became extremely angry when he saw the slogans insulting Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu written by Chiang's troops. He immediately changed them to "Liu-Deng's army is marching south to annihilate nine and a half enemy brigades." After being arrested, the enemy tried to force him to hand over public grain in exchange for his life. However, Pang died under torture, and the enemy only obtained the words "I don't know." Furthermore, an elderly man surnamed Zhang from Shatufa in the same county, whose two sons, Zhang Xie and his younger brother, both joined the People's Liberation Army, was forced by the enemy to call his sons back. The old man angrily said, "They are right to fight Chiang Kai-shek, I cannot call them back." This steadfast old man was actually buried alive. Furthermore, when our army recovered Wujiatai, north of Xinzhen City, on the 9th of this month, four corpses were found in the residential house used as the regimental headquarters of the 1st battalion of the 281st regiment of the 94th division of Chiang's 16th Army, which they had not had time to conceal. The victims were all local farmers. One had his chest and abdomen cut open with bayonets, and his internal organs were spilling out. A bloody human heart had been removed and placed next to the pit. Another had his head split in two, blood flowing all over the room. The corpses were scattered, and the horrific scene was appalling!

    冀中人民坚贞不屈
    【新华社晋察冀二十八日电】窜扰平津保三角地区蒋伪，残杀空前，而人民英勇斗争至死不屈事迹，亦层出不穷。固安五龙村于上月下旬被蒋军包围，该村武委会主任韩治禄未及退出，单人枝枪与敌大队奋战达一日，敌人迫其投降与“捉活的”的卑劣企图均破产，终于杀伤敌人后英勇战死。该县渠沟镇被占后，镇上粮秣主任庞义斋一见蒋军涂写之侮蔑毛主席、朱总司令标语，愤怒异常，立即将其涂改为“刘邓大军南下歼敌九个半旅。”被捕后，敌迫其交出公粮免死。但庞终死于毒刑，而敌人只获得“不知道”三字。又该县沙土垡张姓老人，其子张写二弟兄二人均参加解放军，敌迫其叫回儿子，老人愤然说：“他们打老蒋作得对，我不能叫他们回来。”此坚贞之老人，竟被活埋。又本月九日我军收复新镇城北吴家台时，在蒋军十六军九四师二八一团一营营部所住民房内，发现其未及掩盖之死尸四具。被惨杀者均为当地农民。其一胸腹为刺刀剥开，五脏流出，一颗血淋淋的人心已被摘下放在坑边，另一头颅被劈为二，血流满室，尸体纵横，惨状令人发指！
