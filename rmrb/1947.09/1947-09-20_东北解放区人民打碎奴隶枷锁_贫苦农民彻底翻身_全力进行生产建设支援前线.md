Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 18th—The 33 million people in the Northeast Liberated Areas are recalling and commemorating the 16th anniversary of the "September 18th Incident" with unforgettable feelings and active deeds. Sixteen years ago, under the surrender policy of the great traitor Chiang Kai-shek, the four northeastern provinces were handed over to the enemy, and the people of the Northeast experienced 14 years of tragic slave life. After "August 15th," they were liberated and established a democratic regime. The liberated areas, which account for 90% of the total area of the Northeast, have undergone a new look through two years of struggle to crush the remnants of the enemy and puppets, implement land reform, and adhere to the patriotic self-defense war, and are gradually being consolidated and strengthened. Impoverished peasants, who had groaned under the feudal tyranny of the landlord class for thousands of years, have achieved emancipation politically and economically, and have become the masters of their own land again. Among them, 6.29 million landless and land-poor peasants have obtained 5.03 million hectares of land. Village regimes in the central areas are now basically in the hands of emancipated peasants. The broad masses have taken up guns and stamps of power; thus, the peasants' production enthusiasm has been greatly improved. Approximately 70% to 80% of the peasants in the entire region have universally participated in mutual aid groups, and production efficiency has increased by one-fifth compared with previous years. The entire region completed plowing ten days earlier than in previous years, the cultivated area increased by more than 1.4 million hectares compared with last year, and the wheat area accounted for one-quarter of the total cultivated land, an increase of 10% compared with previous years. The peasants' awareness has also been greatly enhanced, and their fighting enthusiasm for defending their victorious achievements and defeating Chiang's bandit gang's offensive is rising day by day. Hundreds of thousands of emancipated peasants have flocked into the main forces of the Democratic Allied Army and local armed forces in batches. For example, in the new districts of southern Manchuria, the mass emancipation movement has sparked a wave of enthusiasm for joining the army. In Benxi and Panshi alone, more than a thousand young people volunteered to join the army in one day. Chen Xiangde, an old man from Xinbin, personally led his two sons and one grandson to sign up for the army. In the midst of the intense land reform and production movement, emancipated peasants sent good people, good horses, good grain, and good guns to the front lines. In the past year, more than 590,000 people have participated in the war effort, forming 43,000 stretchers and 86,000 carts. During the Democratic Allied Army's summer offensive this year, some people who participated in the war effort traveled thousands of miles with the army, fighting for three months, and their enthusiasm remained high. The urban masses, who account for one-third of the Northeast Liberated Areas, are no less enthusiastic in supporting the front. The Harbin people's plan for 200,000 pairs of military shoes was completed by the end of August and exceeded by 30,000 pairs. Women in Jiamusi City are rushing to make 250,000 sets of cotton clothes for the Democratic Allied Army, and 60,000 sets have been completed. The people of the Northeast are now consciously fighting for their own interests and enthusiastically supporting the army. And during this autumn harvest season, the rear military regions have ordered all troops to help the masses with the autumn harvest for three days, specifically implementing mutual assistance between the army and the people.

　　In the past two years, the construction of industry, commerce, railways, and culture in the Northeast Liberated Areas has also made considerable progress. Industrial and mining enterprises in various places have been restored one after another, and coal production has exceeded that of the puppet Manchukuo era. The liberated areas have abundant coal supply. Light industries related to people's livelihood, such as flour, textile, leather, and papermaking, have sufficient raw materials. Since the beginning of summer, they have been producing in a concentrated manner to support the front lines. The democratic government has also vigorously supported private textile industries. For example, in Qiqihar alone, the number of textile households has increased from more than 3,000 to more than 7,000 in half a year. In some areas, the problem of clothing can now be self-sufficient. The miserable situation in the rural areas of the Northeast during the puppet regime, where several family members wore one pair of pants, is gone forever. The transportation and postal and telecommunications industries have also played a significant role in serving the people and production. Railways, accounting for 69.6% of the total railway lines in the Northeast, with a length of more than 6,600 kilometers, extending east to Suifenhe, west to Manchuria, and north to Jiamusi, are now open to traffic without obstruction. The postal routes, with a length of more than 9,200 kilometers, half of which were newly built after liberation, did not have postal routes in rural areas during the puppet Manchukuo era. Now, larger villages and towns have postal agencies. Telegraph and telephone lines, with a length of more than 6,400 kilometers, connect the large and small cities of the Northeast like a spider web, with rapid transmission and low prices, which are convenient for merchants and travelers. In more than 10,000 large, medium, and small schools in the entire region, more than 925,000 students are receiving democratic education, and the number of children of emancipated people seeking education is increasing day by day. Cultural publishing is becoming increasingly developed. The Northeast Bookstore in Harbin has published more than 200 kinds of famous works in recent years, with more than 1.25 million copies. The Northeast Daily is the most popular newspaper among the masses, with a daily circulation of more than 40,000 copies. Other medium-sized daily newspapers, such as Liaodong, Ximan, and Jilin, have circulations of more than 10,000 copies. Commerce in various cities has also developed. For example, Qiqihar now has more than 3,000 stores, twice as many as at the beginning of liberation. In the past, urban commerce was a market for speculative capital. Now, it has completely changed from the past, adopting the policy of "serving the peasants and the war in the city, and supplying the peasants with cheap daily necessities and agricultural tools." Recently, stores in various places have purchased and transported large quantities of cloth and daily necessities in preparation for selling them to the peasants for the winter. In the past two years, the ever-expanding Northeast Liberated Areas have established a rudimentary form of a new democratic China in all aspects, laying a solid foundation for liberating the entire Northeast and supporting the overall counter-offensive victory of the People's Liberation Army.

　　东北解放区人民打碎奴隶枷锁
  　贫苦农民彻底翻身
  　全力进行生产建设支援前线
    【新华社东北十八日电】东北解放区三千三百万人民以不能忘怀的心情和积极的行动，来回忆和纪念“九一八”十六周年。十六年前东北四省在大汉奸蒋介石投降政策下拱手送敌，从此东北人民就经历了十四年悲惨的奴隶生活。“八、一五”后获得解放并建立民主政权。占东北全面积百分之九十的解放区，经过两年来粉碎敌伪残余的斗争、实行土地改革与坚持爱国自卫战争已面目一新，并正逐渐巩固壮大。几千年来呻吟在地主阶级封建淫威下的贫苦农民，在政治上、经济上获得翻身，重新成为自己土地的主人，其中有六百二十九万无地少地农民，获得土地五百零三万垧。中心地区乡村政权已基本掌握在翻身农民手中，广大群众拿起枪把子、印把子；农民的生产情绪因而大大提高。全区约有百分之七十至八十的农民普遍参加了互助组，生产效率较往年提高五分之一，全区耕田较往年提早十天完成，耕地面积较去年增加一百四十余万垧，麦地面积占总耕地四分之一，较往年增加百分之十。农民觉悟亦大为提高，对保卫自己胜利果实，击败蒋贼进攻的战斗热情正日益高涨。数十万翻身农民成批涌入民主联军主力及地方武装，如南满新区群众在翻身运动中，掀起了参军热潮，单本溪、盘石两地，一天自动参军之青年即达千余人，新宾老人陈橡德并亲率二子一孙报名参军。在紧张的土地改革及生产运动中，翻身农民将好人、好马、好粮、好枪送往前方。一年来参战群众已达五十九万余人，组成担架四万三千付，大车八万六千辆。在民主联军今年夏季攻势中，有些参战群众随军跋涉数千里，转战三个月，情绪始终高涨。占东北解放区三分之一的城市群众，支前热情亦不后人，哈市人民二十万双军鞋计划，已于八月底完成并超过三万双。佳木斯市妇女为民主联军赶制二十五万套棉衣，现已完成六万套。东北人民现在是自觉的为自己的利益而战，热烈拥护军队，而当此秋收季节，后方各军区已责成各部队一律帮助群众秋收三天，具体实行军民互助。
    两年来东北解放区工、商、铁路、文化等建设也有长足的进步。各地工矿业已次第恢复，煤的产量也超过伪满时代，解放区用煤充裕无缺。与民生有关的面粉、纺织、皮革、造纸等轻工业，原料充足，入夏以来，均为支援前线而突击生产。民主政府更大力扶助民间纺织，如齐齐哈尔一地，半年间纺户由三千余增至七千余，若干地区穿衣问题已可自给自足，敌伪统治时代东北农村一家数口穿一条裤子的惨状，已一去不返。交通邮电事业在为人民与生产服务也起了很大作用，占全东北铁路线百分之六十九点六的长达六千六百余公里的铁路，东至绥芬河、西达满洲里、北抵佳木斯，均已通车无阻。长达九千二百余公里的邮路，其中二分之一为解放后新建，伪满时代农村不设邮路，现较大村镇均有邮政代办所。电报电话线长达六千四百余公里，把东北大小城市密如蛛网般的联结一起，拍发迅速，价格低廉，商旅莫不称便。全区一万余所大中小学校，计有九十二万五千余学生得受民主教育，翻身人民子弟求学者日增。文化出版事业日益发达，哈市东北书店年来出版之各种名著即达二百余种，一百二十五万余册。报纸以东北日报最受群众欢迎，日出四万余份，其余如辽东、西满、吉林等十余家中型日报，销路均在万份以上。各都市之商业均有发展，如齐齐哈尔现有商店三千余家，较初解放时增加两倍。过去城市商业为游资投机市场，现均一变过去，采取以“城市为农民和战争服务，供给农民以廉价的日用品及农具”的方针，最近各地店家均纷纷购运大量布匹及日用品，准备售予农民过冬。两年来日益扩大的东北解放区，已在各方面建立了新民主中国的雏形，打下了解放整个东北以及支援解放军全面反攻胜利的稳固基础。
