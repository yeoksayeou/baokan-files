    Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, Urgent Telegram, 22nd: On the eve of the six-month anniversary (September 19th) of our army's withdrawal from Yan'an, a military spokesperson of the Northwest People's Liberation Army Headquarters, at a location 40 kilometers from Yan'an, commented to reporters on the significant changes in the Northwest war situation over the past six months. In the past six months, the Northwest People's Liberation Army has annihilated eight brigades or more of the Kuomintang regular army, with a total of over 50,000 enemy troops eliminated, including those annihilated in regiments and smaller units, transforming the Northwest war situation from strategic defense to strategic counter-offensive. The spokesperson pointed out that this enormous victory contains rich and vivid content, demonstrating that our army is growing stronger day by day, while the enemy is becoming weaker and heading towards decline. At the time of the victory in Qinghuabian, Yan'an, on March 25th, our army only annihilated one enemy brigade headquarters and one regiment. By the time of the Yangma River victory in Zichang (i.e., Anding) on April 14th, our army was able to block the offensive of nine enemy brigades and annihilate one entire brigade. During the Panlong victory on May 2nd, more than 8,000 enemy troops stubbornly defended strong fortifications but were completely annihilated under our powerful siege. In the Huanxian battle on June 16th, the 81st Division suffered a devastating blow. By the time of the Shajiadian victory in Mizhi on August 20th, the Kuomintang army, with nine and a half brigades advancing north in three routes, had its elite 36th Division annihilated by our army in one fell swoop. And this time, in the pursuit of the retreating Kuomintang army in the Chaikou area of Yanchuan, we blocked five enemy brigades, one regiment, two division headquarters, and two army headquarters, and routed as many as four brigades after three days of fighting. When Chiang Kai-shek and Hu Zongnan mobilized 34 brigades to invade the border region and occupy the empty city of Yan'an, the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries held "celebration meetings" in various Kuomintang-controlled areas, as if their dying dog lives had obtained a miraculous cure. The Chiang-Hu bandit chiefs were indeed intoxicated by the occupation of Yan'an,妄想妄想 to eliminate the Northwest People's Liberation Army within "three months." But three months passed quickly, and today, six months later, it is not the People's Liberation Army that has been eliminated, but Chiang Kai-shek and Hu Zongnan's bandit army. In the past six months, one-third of Hu's direct lineage has been annihilated by our army. Under the fierce attacks of our army, the enemy troops in various units have suffered very serious attrition. Six months ago, Hu's elite 36th Division, 165th Brigade, had more than 10,000 men, and other brigades also had around 8,000 men; but when this brigade was annihilated at Shajiadian, it had only more than 3,000 men. The decline in the enemy's combat effectiveness is also quite astonishing. This time, the enemy at Chaikou was so numerous that when besieged by us, they collapsed like sheep encountering tigers. Hu Zongnan has repeatedly boasted that he would seek a decisive battle with our main force. But in reality, Hu Zongnan only dared to concentrate his main force for "encirclement and suppression," specializing in massacring women and children and plundering the people's property. When approaching our army, knowing that our main force was nearby, he fled east and west,不敢决战daring not engage in a decisive battle. Chiang Kai-shek and Hu Zongnan have repeatedly and shamelessly propagated that they have "driven" the People's Liberation Army "across the Yellow River" and that northern Shaanxi has been "completely cleared." In fact, it is not others who are about to be "cleared," but only Hu Zongnan himself. The result of the Chaikou campaign proves that Hu Zongnan's downfall is not far away. The spokesperson pointed out that the victory in the Northwest theater is even more importantly manifested in the great coordination it has provided to other theaters, promoting the rapid development of the national counter-offensive. When the Chiang-Hu armies were invested in the Northwest theater, General Chen Geng launched an offensive in southwestern Shanxi in early April and liberated vast areas of southwestern Shanxi in 29 days. Our army's move to lure the enemy northward, pulling all of Chiang-Hu's mobile forces into the narrow area of northern Shaanxi, created a favorable situation for General Chen Geng's army to cross the Yellow River to the south and liberate Henan and Shaanxi. Now Xi'an is in imminent danger, and Hu Zongnan is already in a panic. Time is only half a year, and the changes are so rapid. It is not difficult to imagine that Hu Zongnan's doomsday is not far away, and the liberation of the Great Northwest is about to be realized.

    西北我军半年歼敌五万余
    胡宗南匪军末日已近
    西安刻正告急大西北解放在即
    【新华社西北廿二日急电】正是我军退出延安半年（九月十九日）的前夕，西北人民解放军总部某军事发言人于离延安四十公里之某地，向记者评述半年来西北战局的大变化。半年来西北人民解放军共歼灭蒋军正规军整团以上八个旅，连团以下被歼者共约五万余人，使西北战局由战略防御转入战略反攻。该发言人指出：这个巨大的胜利，包含着丰富生动的内容，显示着我军日益壮大、敌军则愈战愈弱，日趋衰亡。在三月廿五日延安青化砭胜利时，我军仅消灭敌军一个旅部和一个团。四月十四日子长（即安定）羊马河胜利时，我军即能阻击敌九个旅的进攻，而消灭其中一个整旅。五月二日蟠龙胜利时，敌八千余人顽守坚固工事，亦在我强力围攻下全部就歼。六月十六日环县战斗，八十一师受我歼灭性打击。到上月二十日米脂沙家店胜利时，蒋军以九个半旅三路北犯，被我军一举歼灭其精锐的三十六师。而此次追击南退之蒋军于延川岔口地区，阻击敌五个旅另一个团两个师部及两个军部，经三天战斗击溃其四个旅之多。当蒋介石胡宗南动员三十四个旅侵入边区和占领延安空城时，蒋介石反动派曾在蒋管区各地开什么“庆祝会”，好象他们垂死的狗命从此得到了起死回生的灵丹妙药一样。蒋胡匪首的确曾因占了延安而冲昏头脑，妄想“三个月”内消灭西北人民解放军。但三个月很快就过去了，到六个月后的今天，被消灭的不是人民解放军，而是蒋介石胡宗南的匪军。半年来胡军嫡系已被我歼灭三分之一。在我军猛烈打击下，敌军各部减员非常严重，半年前胡军精锐三十六师一六五旅有一万余人，其他各旅亦在八千人左右；但该旅到沙家店被歼时，仅有三千多人。敌军战斗力的下降，其速度亦颇惊人。此次岔口之敌如此众多，被我围攻时，竟如羊群遇虎，溃不成军。胡宗南曾多次夸口说，要找我军主力决战。但实际上胡宗南只敢集中主力进行什么“清剿”，专事屠杀妇孺，劫掠百姓财物，待接近我军时，明知我主力近在咫尺，却东逃西躲，不敢决战。蒋介石、胡宗南曾一再无耻宣传他们已把解放军“赶过黄河”，陕北已“完全肃清。”事实上正要被“肃清”的不是别人，而只是胡宗南自己。岔口会战的结果，证明胡宗南的覆没已经不远。发言人指出：西北战场的胜利，更重要的还是表现在对其他战场起了伟大的配合作用，促成了全国大反攻的迅速开展。当蒋、胡军投入西北战场后不久，陈赓将军于四月初即在晋西南展开攻势，二十九天即解放晋西南广大地区。我军此次诱敌北进，把蒋、胡机动兵力全部拉到陕北北部的狭小地区，又给陈赓将军的大军南渡黄河、解放豫陕，造成了有利的形势。现在西安已经告急，胡宗南已经手忙脚乱。时间不过半年，变化如此之快，不难想象胡宗南的末日已经不远，大西北的解放就要实现了。
