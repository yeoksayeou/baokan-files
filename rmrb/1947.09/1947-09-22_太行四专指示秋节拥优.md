    Taihang Fourth Administrative Region Issues Instructions
    Support the Military Dependents Well During the Mid-Autumn Festival
    [Reported by this newspaper] In order to strengthen the work of supporting the military, the Taihang Fourth Administrative Office convened a meeting of civil affairs section members from various counties in late August, specifically to discuss the work of giving preferential treatment to military dependents and honorably discharged veterans, and to study the work of supporting the military during the Mid-Autumn Festival. It was decided that before the Mid-Autumn Festival, all localities should convene meetings of honorably discharged veterans and village education directors respectively to discover model figures and deeds among village cadres, military dependents, and honorably discharged veterans. During the Mid-Autumn Festival, commendation and model selection activities should be carried out, and military dependents and honorably discharged veterans should be organized to give opinions to cadres and the government in order to strengthen relations.
