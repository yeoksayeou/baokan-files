　　【Report from Taihang】With the Mid-Autumn Festival approaching, the Taihang Second Administrative District, in order to further improve the work of supporting the army, issued instructions to all counties on September 8, calling for a widespread support-the-army inspection to inspire the masses to recognize the importance of support-the-army work from the basis of class consciousness, and to form a mass support-the-army movement. Through this movement, the following tasks will be completed: 1. Summarize the work of substitute farming, based on the poor harvest caused by this year's drought, to give specific accounts to military dependents and demobilized soldiers, combined with famine relief education, to encourage thrift and further build up households. 2. Launch a concentrated effort to accumulate fertilizer, prepare to help veterans and families of soldiers with wheat planting and autumn harvesting. According to the specific conditions of each region, organize labor to concentrate on composting green manure, collecting manure, beating kang soil, sheep bedding, and other fertilizer accumulation methods to solve fertilizer difficulties and overcome the previous bad habit of only substitute farming without applying fertilizer. And encourage military dependents, families of martyrs, and veterans to actively participate. 3. Around the Mid-Autumn Festival, mobilize families, the masses, and cadres to write letters to the front lines, reporting on their substitute farming situation and family situation. 4. Families of cadres on expedition must also be convened to meetings and enjoy the same treatment as military dependents. The names of cadres on expedition should be collected by district and county, their family situations understood, and compiled into a register as a basis for regular care.
