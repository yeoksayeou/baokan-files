    【This newspaper, Jinnan, 19th dispatch】 After the masses in Houxinlizhuang, Ningnan, exposed the big landlord, Chu Jingui, from the Juxing Store of the Production Section of the Gengzhuangqiao Administrative Office, the Directors Meng and Wang of the Administrative Office immediately sent a letter to the Ningnan County Party Committee and the Houxinlizhuang Farmers' Association, expressing their attitude to resolutely support the peasants. The letter stated: Landlord Chu Jingui is to be immediately expelled by the Juxing Store and handed over to the masses of Houxinlizhuang for struggle and liquidation. The masses can search as much as possible for all property and shares hidden in the Juxing Store, and they are completely free to dispose of them. The attitude of the store manager, Zhao Yinbao, in protecting the landlord has been ordered by the Juxing Store headquarters to be inspected, strictly punished, and even dismissed. At the same time, Zhao Yinbao was ordered to ensure that all the landlord Chu Jingui’s property in the store be handed over to the masses, apologize to the masses, and accept criticism from the masses. The Administrative Office expressed its regret for the occurrence of this incident, as it had not been detected beforehand, causing the landlord to be hidden in our public store. It also stated that if similar incidents occur in various places in the future, the local masses can handle them with full authority, and the Administrative Office will never protect them.
    【This newspaper, Jinnan, 19th dispatch】 The public stores in Handan City are investigating and squeezing out feudal elements. In the in-depth re-investigation, many landlords and local bullies infiltrated Handan City and hid in public stores through various relationships. In order to cooperate with the mass movement and ensure the purity of the public stores, the Municipal Public Security Bureau, in conjunction with the Public Store Committee, held a meeting of cadres above the group leader level to clarify their thinking by studying the policy situation and determined: (1) to ensure a thorough investigation within the store; (2) to help other stores clean up thoroughly; (3) to immediately hand over anyone discovered to the Public Security Bureau for return to their original place of residence. After seven days of work, 61 landlords and children of those who had been struggled against were discovered in 11 public stores, including 10 managers and deputy managers. Comrade Hu Xingshou, the supervisor of the Taiji General Store and director of the Public Store Committee, personally went to Shexian County to investigate the situation of the managers of two branch stores. At first, the masses did not dare to mention it, because they were managers of Taiji, riding horses when they went out, which was very impressive. Later, they said: "The landlord was overthrown, and he went on horseback again after joining the public store. If he is not struggled against, he is an ordinary person; once he is struggled against, he gets on horseback. The landlord has turned over, from underground to on horseback." After understanding the situation, they immediately completed the formalities, checked their internal property, and found 200 silver dollars and 280,000 Jichaos from the two, which were sent to the Municipal Public Security Bureau and forwarded to their place of origin to be handed over to the masses. Manager Guo of Dafeng personally took the lead in investigating his store and found that the father-in-law of a branch cadre had been hiding for several months to escape the struggle. After the investigation, he was sent to the Public Security Bureau and forwarded to his place of origin. Manager Wang of Tongjigong personally took the lead and studied land reform with three cadres, and the cadres' thinking was clarified, squeezing out six struggle targets from a small unit.
