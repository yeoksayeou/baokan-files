　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 6th: Soviet Academician Varga recently gave a special lecture here on "The Marshall Plan and the US-British Economies." He began by pointing out that the Marshall Plan is a direct continuation of Truman's expansionist policy. Varga stated that the plan's external objective is to transform the new democratic countries of Eastern Europe into ordinary capitalist countries; to form a Western European bloc under US leadership; and to restore Germany's economic and military power with US capital, incorporating western Germany into the Western European bloc. Varga strongly asserted that the Marshall Plan's motivation is not humanitarianism, but for the benefit of US monopoly capital. The United States is currently experiencing a "boom," but the result of high prices (double pre-war levels) and falling wages (industrial workers' wages down 10 percent) has led to a rapid accumulation of goods, with inventories now reaching 37 billion dollars. The purpose of the Marshall Plan, which proposes exporting American goods through state-backed credit loans, is to maintain the domestic "boom." However, Varga believes that the Marshall Plan cannot save the United States from a crisis. He said: "According to the Marshall Plan, the United States may export another 5 to 6 billion dollars worth of goods through credit loans, but this will not prevent a crisis. The current total annual output of the United States is about 200 billion dollars. Even if the crisis is not severe and production only decreases by 15 percent, which is 30 billion dollars, how can 5 or 6 billion dollars save the US economy?" Discussing the British economy, Varga pointed out that the current British crisis is characterized by the fact that it lost most of its investment during the war. In 1938, Britain's foreign investment income was 170 million pounds, while in 1946 it was only 50 million pounds. This crisis is a result of the Labor government and the British bourgeoisie continuing their imperialist policies despite the weakening economic foundation. In 1938, military spending accounted for only 7 percent of national revenue, while in 1947 it accounted for 11 percent. However, Varga believes that the main reason for the British crisis is the very harsh conditions of the US loans. Britain now needs new loans, and the US conditions will undoubtedly be even harsher, requiring the cession of the Ruhr and the cessation of British industrial nationalization. Varga emphasized the profound contradictions between European countries and the United States, especially between Britain and the United States. He concluded that the Marshall Plan, in terms of its main objectives, has failed. It has encountered strong resistance not only in Europe but also within the United States. He said that loans to one or several countries are not something that Marshall or Truman can decide; it requires the approval of Congress, and Congress will not convene until January 1948. In 1948, the United States will elect a president, the entire House of Representatives, and one-third of the Senate. Before Congress approves the plan, it will naturally consider the opinions of the American people.

　　瓦尔加论马歇尔计划与美英经济
    【新华社陕北六日电】莫斯科讯：苏联大学士瓦尔加顷在此间作“马歇尔计划与美英经济”的专题讲演。他首先指出：马歇尔计划是杜鲁门扩张政策的直接继续。瓦氏称：该计划的对外目的，在于使东欧新民主国家变成普通资本主义国家；组成美国领导下的西欧集团，并以美国资本恢复德国经济军事力量，把德国西部包括到西欧集团内。瓦氏力称：马歇尔计划的动机不是人道主义，而是为了美国独占资本的利益。美国目前正经历着“景气”，然物价高涨（倍于战前）与工资跌落（产业工人工资跌百分之十）的结果，已造成货物之迅速堆积，存货现已达三百七十亿元。马歇尔计划提出以国家信用贷款方式输出美货之目的，即在于维持国内“景气”。但瓦尔加认为，马歇尔计划并不能挽救美国的危机。他说：“依照马歇尔计划，美国可能以信用贷款方式再输出五十至六十亿元货物，但这并不能阻止危机。现在美国每年生产总值约为二千亿元，即是危机不严重，而生产也只降低百分之十五，即三百亿元，那么五十或六十亿元如何能挽救美国经济呢？”论及英国经济时，瓦尔加指出：目前英国危机的特点是它在战时损失了投资的大部，三八年英国国外投资收入是一亿七千万镑，四六年则仅及五千万镑。这种危机，乃是工党政府与英国资产阶级不顾经济基础削弱仍图继续其帝国主义政策的结果。三八年军费只占全国岁收百分之七，四七年则占百分之十一。但瓦尔加认为：英国危机主要原因则是美国贷款条件十分苛刻。英国现在又要新贷款，美国的条件无疑将更苛刻，它将要求让出鲁尔，停止英国工业国有化。瓦尔加着重指出欧洲国家与美国间，尤其是英美间的深刻矛盾。他结论说：马歇尔计划就其主要目的说来，已遭失败。它不仅在欧洲，而且在美国国内都遭到坚强的反抗。他说：对一国或数国贷款，不是马歇尔或杜鲁门能决定的，它要经国会的批准；而国会要到四八年一月才开会。四八年美国要选举总统及众院全部及参院三分之一，国会批准之前，自然要考虑美国人民的意见。
