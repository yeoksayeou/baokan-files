　　Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 8th. The Yimeng Mountain area people's guerrilla armed forces bravely fought behind enemy lines, cooperating with the main force to smash the Chiang army's key offensives. In July and August, they killed and captured more than 1,400 Chiang Kai-shek troops and puppet soldiers. Most of the Yimeng Mountain area, spanning over 300 li, has been recovered. Counties such as Yi (Shui) South, Yi (Shui) East, and Mengshan (newly established county northeast of Feixian) have quickly transitioned to re-examination. Since the area turned to the enemy's rear in late June, the people's armed work teams have frequently appeared in the suburbs of Mengyin, Xintai, and Yishui counties, as well as near the highways of Xin (Tai) Da (Wen), Yi (Shui) Meng (Yin), and Si (Shui) Meng (Yin), to strike at Chiang's troops and puppets and protect the masses from counter-reckonings. A portion of the local armed forces has steadfastly defended the Da Gu, Ban Gu, Nanbei Dai Gu area, directly pinning down four divisions of the Chiang army's main force on the front. The enemy has repeatedly assembled forces of more than one division to invade, but they have been bravely repelled by the defenders, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy. In mid-July, the eastern local armed forces cooperated with the Nanma and Linqu blocking battles, effectively blocking the enemy reinforcing Yishui from Xintai, forcing them to pay a considerable price, and only being able to crawl more than ten li in a day. The western local armed forces penetrated the Culaishan area, opening up the situation for persistence in the western part of the Yimeng area. A portion even advanced to the side of the Jinpu Railway, intercepting Chiang's troops between Tai'an and Ziyang. After months of fighting bravely behind enemy lines, a certain county's armed work team has developed from not having machine guns to possessing more than 50 machine guns, and frequently attacks the Chiang-controlled borders of neighboring counties. In late August, the Mengyin armed work team, in cooperation with the local armed forces, formed a more than 40-li encirclement in the Mengyin Tanbu, Jiagushi, and Houtumiao area, completely annihilating the Chiang-appointed sixth district office, five township offices, and liberating more than 40 villages. They also took advantage of the victory to capture @Yanggu and other places, capturing 36 enemy soldiers. On the Linyi to Yishui highway, although the enemy has set up transportation camps along the way to protect the road, they dare not go beyond five or six li around the strongholds.
    Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 8th. The Yi (Shui) North militia heroically resisted the Chiang army that invaded Yi (Shui), Bo (Shan), Qing (Zhou), Lin (Yi) and other places. As of August 10, there were more than 250 large and small battles in one month, capturing 84 Chiang Kai-shek soldiers and "Returning Home Corps" armed Chiang secret agents, killing and wounding 47 enemy soldiers below the rank of company commander. The enemy was forced to not establish a Chiang-puppet regime in a single village, and all landlords dared not engage in counter-reckoning or restoration. A regiment of Chiang's 25th Division was besieged by our militia in the Chaishanshi area and could not contact Chiang's army in Yicheng. Individual soldiers who went to the surrounding villages to find food were captured alive within ten days.
