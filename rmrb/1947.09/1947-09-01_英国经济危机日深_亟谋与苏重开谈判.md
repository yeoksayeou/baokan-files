Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 27th -- Comprehensive reports: In recent weeks, the British Cabinet has held two emergency meetings to discuss dealing with the economic crisis. According to various dispatches, the current crisis has become increasingly urgent due to the suspension of the convertibility of the pound sterling into US dollars, announced on the night of the 20th. The second emergency cabinet meeting on the afternoon of the 25th, after listening to the report of the British Chief Representative to the United States, Edie (Mr. Edie returned to Britain from the United States on the 25th) on amending the terms of the loan, discussed the international reaction to the suspension of convertibility measure. This was one of the main topics of the meeting. Agence France-Presse reported on the 21st that European countries would stop shipping grain to Britain after the pound sterling was suspended. According to a United Press dispatch on the 25th, US grain exports to Britain may be reduced by 25% or 50%, and there are also reports that Argentina will stop shipping most of the meat needed by Britain. The Swedish government had originally planned to hold trade negotiations with Britain on the 26th, but it has now postponed the announcement of the suspension of the pound sterling. The Swedish National Bank announced on the 21st that it would stop buying pounds and cancel the commercial banks' right to trade US dollars and pounds (the bank's pound deposits in July reached 25 million pounds, but it is now forced to be unable to convert them into US dollars). Another topic of the emergency meeting was the issue of food imports, because once US food exports to Britain are reduced, the food rations, which have already made the British population suffer from insufficient rations, will have to be reduced again. The meeting discussed how to resume British coal exports to Europe as soon as possible in exchange for food imports. However, since the 21st, negotiations between the British Cabinet, the National Coal Board, and the executive committee of the miners' trade union on extending miners' working hours to increase coal production have not yet reached an agreement. According to an Agence France-Presse dispatch on the 25th, ministers also discussed resuming trade negotiations with the Soviet Union at the cabinet meeting. The agency said: Although this news has not been confirmed, it is "increasingly credible. Because since the pound sterling was suspended against the US dollar, Britain has had to look for important import sources outside the dollar area, and at the same time, a considerable number of Labour Party leftists (including Crossman and Mikardo) are firmly in favor of reopening negotiations with the Soviet Union."
    
Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 29th -- According to Agence France-Presse, London: An authoritative source in London revealed on the 27th that the British Ambassador to the Soviet Union has repeatedly suggested to Soviet Foreign Trade Minister Mikoyan to eliminate the reasons that prevented the previous trade negotiations between the two countries from reaching an agreement, and to clear the way for the early resumption of negotiations. British Trade Minister Cripps also discussed the resumption of British-Soviet trade negotiations with Soviet Ambassador to Britain, Zarubin. Well-informed sources in London said on the 26th that Britain and the Soviet Union had both put the issue of resuming trade negotiations between the two sides at the forefront. The well-informed source also said that as a result of the depletion of dollar assets, Britain has been excluded from the British market, and she will try to obtain food and raw materials from the Soviet government. If negotiations resume, Cripps will be appointed as the head of the British delegation.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 27th -- London News: British public opinion has recently fiercely criticized the Labour Party authorities' policy of relying on US aid, and criticized the United States' overbearing attitude as if it were the head of the family. A Renault News editorial on the 25th said: "If we think that unreliable dollar transfusions can maintain our national independence and international status, as a country, we are deceiving ourselves." The newspaper called on Britain to "dismiss the fantasy that it will one day regain some of the dollars that Britain depends on." The newspaper said: "We are dealing with American monopolists who control the atomic economy; this country does not need our exports and prevents us from making long-term agreements with countries that need our exports." The newspaper pointed out that the only hope for Britain to escape the cyclical dollar crisis and the inevitable American crash is to "enter into particularly long-term trade agreements with countries that are prepared to contract with us." The Standard Evening News editorial on the 22nd, referring to the suspension of the pound sterling against the US dollar, said: "Britain has become no different from a poor dependent of the United States, and under the loan agreement, the British people are no longer the head of the family."

　　英国经济危机日深
  　亟谋与苏重开谈判
    【新华社陕北二十七日电】综合报导：近周来英国内阁已两度召开紧急会议，研讨处理经济危机的事宜。据各方电传，目前之危机，已因二十日夜所宣布之英镑暂停兑换美元措施而日趋紧急。二十五日下午第二次紧急内阁会议，于听取赴美谈判修改贷款条件之英首席代表伊地（伊氏系于二十五日自美返英）报告后，即讨论此项停兑措施之国际反应。此为会议主题之一。法新社二十一日电称：镑元停兑后，欧洲各国将停止以粮食运英。据合众社二十五日传称：美国输英粮食可能减少百分之二十五或百分之五十，而阿根廷也有停止以英国所需要大部肉类运英的消息，瑞典政府本拟于二十六日与英举行贸易谈判，刻也因镑元之停兑宣告延期。瑞典国家银行二十一日宣布停止购买英镑，并取消给予商业银行美元英镑交易之权利（按该行七月份英镑存款达两千五百万镑，现被迫不能兑换美元）。紧急会议的另一主题为粮食输入问题，因一旦美输英粮食减缩，则目前业已使英人口粮不足的粮食配给，不得不再行减少，会议讨论如何尽快地恢复英煤对欧之输出，以换取粮食入口。惟自二十一日以来，英阁与全国煤业局及矿工职工会执委三方面关于延长矿工工作时间以增加煤产之谈判，迄未获致协议。据法新社二十五日电，内阁会议上，各大臣并曾讨论与苏联恢复贸易谈判事。该社称：此讯虽未证实，然却“越发可信。因为自英镑停兑美元以来，英不能不向美元以外地区寻找重要的入口来源，同时又因为相当多的工党左派（包括克罗斯曼与米卡尔多）均坚主与苏重开谈判”。
    【新华社陕北二十九日电】据法新社伦敦讯：二十七日伦敦权威方面透露，英驻苏大使曾数次向苏对外贸易部长米高扬建议，要求消除使上次两国贸易谈判未能获致协议的原因，而给早日重开谈判扫清道路。英商务部长克利浦斯也与苏驻英大使查罗滨，就恢复英苏贸易谈判事进行商讨。二十六日伦敦消息灵通人士称：英苏均已将恢复双方贸易谈判问题放在最前列。该消息灵通人士并称：英国因美元资财枯竭的结果，已被摒弃于英国市场之外，她将企图自苏联政府获取食物与原料。如谈判恢复，克利浦斯将被任为英代表团团长。
    【新华社陕北二十七日电】伦敦讯：英舆论界近激烈抨击工党当局之依赖美国援助政策；并抨击美国俨如家主般的专横。雷诺新闻二十五日社论称：“假如我们以为靠不住的美元输血就能维持我们的国家独立与国际地位，作为一个国家，那是我们欺骗自己。”该报呼吁英国“打消有一天会再获得英国所依赖的一些美元的空想”。该报称：“我们正与控制着原子经济的美国垄断家交涉；这个国家不需要我们的出口货，并且阻止我们和那些需要我们的出口货的国家订立长期协定。”该报指出：使英国免于循环的美元危机和不可避免的美国暴跌的唯一希望，是“与那些准备与我们订约的国家订立特别长期的贸易协定。”标准晚报二十二日社论论及英镑暂停兑换美元时称：“英国已无异于成为美国的贫穷的依附国，在贷款协定下，英国人民再不是一家之主了。”
