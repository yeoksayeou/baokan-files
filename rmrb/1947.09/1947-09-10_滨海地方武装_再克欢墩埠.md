　　Local Armed Forces of the Binhai Area
  　Recapture Huandunbu
    The Binhai Military Sub-district's main armed force, in coordination with local militia and work teams, attacked the enemy's important stronghold of Huandunbu on the Lin (Yi) Qing (kou) road on the night of the 12th of last month. The defending enemy, a company of the 44th Division and more than 200 members of the "Home Return Corps," fled upon hearing the news. Huandunbu was recaptured (Note: This area was liberated by the East China Liberation Army on June 26th, but was later reoccupied by Chiang's troops). Another local armed force captured Zhuang Wang Tang on the same day, capturing more than 60 members of the "Home Return Corps." In the morning of the same day, an enemy platoon from Shahe invaded west of Caozibu and was routed by our army, with 15 enemy soldiers killed, wounded, or captured. Currently, there are no enemy traces in the vast area between Huandunbu and Shahe. In total, in the early part of August, the main armed forces in various parts of Binhai took the initiative to attack the enemy, engaging in more than ten battles of varying sizes, killing or wounding 101 Chiang's soldiers and "Home Return Corps" members, capturing 105 alive, seizing 19 field artillery vehicles, and a portion of other firearms and materials.
