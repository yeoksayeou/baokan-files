　　[Our Newspaper, Taiyue, 10th Dispatch] Yang Zhanglai from Han Hong, Qinyuan, relying on poor and hired laborers as the backbone, developed mutual aid with great success and was selected as a district model. Comrade Yang Zhanglai, a poor peasant of shepherd and hired laborer origin, deeply realized the importance of unity and mutual aid among poor and hired peasants during the land reform. At the beginning of spring plowing, he said, "I want to follow Shi Zhenming's path of production mutual aid, from poverty to wealth." He first mobilized the poor peasants Duan Maosheng and Yang Maohai to work together. The three of them did the work of four people in one day. He then used the benefits of this mutual aid to mobilize poor peasants such as Li Wenlin and Guo Liansheng. In less than ten days, it had grown to thirteen people, and everyone elected Yang Zhanglai as the group leader. During sowing, Liu Jinnu and Li Fuwang in the group had problems with food and drink and asked to withdraw from mutual aid to work as hired laborers. Yang Zhanglai then launched everyone in the group to collect firewood twice, selling it for a total of 8,430 yuan, buying two *shi* of corn, and lending it to Liu Jinnu and Li Fuwang, solving the problem. Soon, problems arose again in the group: Yang Quansheng's wife, Zhang Gui'e, quarreled with her father-in-law, which made Yang Quansheng feel down. Liu Jinnu's wife also proposed to divorce Liu. Comrade Yang Zhanglai personally went to each house and persuaded them earnestly, finally reconciling the two families. From then on, people who were unwilling to participate in mutual aid came to participate, and the labor force in the whole group increased to twenty-nine people. Yang Quansheng's wife, Zhang Gui'e, and Jinniu's wife also participated in the mutual aid group. Even grandmothers, grandfathers, and children were organized to hold plows, cook, deliver meals, and feed pigs, from individual mutual aid to family mutual aid. Yang Zhanglai, Ji Changrui, and Yang Laizhen's whole family, men and women, participated. Now, there are a total of ninety-six people, men, women, old and young. In order to consolidate mutual aid, they also used their spare time to organize transportation, and have now earned 178,167 yuan. They also established a credit cooperative, lending money to help everyone solve their difficulties during the busy farming season, and the group members can also share dividends. During the slack farming season, they use capital to engage in sideline businesses. Now the credit cooperative fund has reached 500,000 yuan. Everyone borrows when they need it and saves when they don't, which has played a great role in consolidating mutual aid.

　　互助依靠贫雇不断扩大巩固
  　杨张来领导好当选全区模范
    【本报太岳十日电】沁源韩洪杨张来，依靠贫雇为骨干，发展互助，成绩很大，被选为全区模范。扬张来同志是牧工、雇工出身的贫苦农民，在土地改革中，他深刻认识到贫雇农民团结互助的重要，春耕开始时，他说：“我要走石振明生产互助、由贫变富的路。”首先动员了贫苦农民段茂胜、杨茂孩两人，在一块动弹，三个人一天干了四个人的活，他又拿这互助的好处，去动员了李文磷、郭连生等贫苦农民，不到十天便发展到十三人了，大家选杨张来当组长。下种时，组内刘金牛、李福旺吃喝成问题，要求退出互助，去打忙工，杨张来就在组内发动大家打两次柴，共卖八千四百三十元，买了两石玉茭，借给刘金牛和李福旺，把问题解决了。不久组内又发生了问题：杨全生的女人张贵娥和他翁翁吵架，弄得杨全生情绪不高，刘金牛的女人也提出要跟刘离婚。杨张来同志便亲到各家苦口相劝，终于把两家的事和解了。从此不愿参加互助的人，都来参加了，全组劳力增加到二十九人，全生的女人张贵娥和金牛的女人都参加了互助组，连老婆婆、老汉汉以及儿童们，也都组织起来托犁拐、做饭、送饭、喂猪，由一人互助发展到全家互助。杨张来、吉昌瑞、杨来贞全家男女都参加了，现在男女老少共发展到九十六个人。他们为巩固互助，又利用余工组织运输，现在已经赚了十七万八千一百六十七元。还成立了个信贷合作社，农忙时将款贷去帮助大家解决困难，组员还能分红，农闲时用资本去搞副业，现在信贷社基金已达五十万元，大家紧用就贷，不紧就存，对巩固互助起了很大作用。
