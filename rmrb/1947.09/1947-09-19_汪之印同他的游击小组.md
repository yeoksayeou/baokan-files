　　Wang Zhiyin and His Guerrilla Squad
  　Ji Lu Yu Correspondent
    After the enemy's third occupation of Yuncheng, Comrade Wang Zhiyin and his guerrilla squad, Li Quanjing, Shan Mengrui, Ren Tingsan, and Li Yitao, a total of five people, continued to persist in the area, fighting guerrillas against the enemy and implementing the distribution of land with guns. Comrade Wang had already been recognized as a model for his persistence in guerrilla warfare during the enemy's first two occupations of Yuncheng. This time, he was holding out in the Dan'gai sub-district. The Dan'gai sub-district has × villages, with the closest village being eight li from the city, while the area surrounding Yuncheng city was filled with enemies. The five of them appeared on Dan'gai street the day after the enemy occupied Yuncheng. The masses, seeing their own people, hadn't left and excitedly grabbed their hands, urging them, "Don't leave! Don't let the cowards come and scare us!" That afternoon, four "Homecoming Legions" heard that the guerrilla squad was in the village and fled in panic. On the 3rd of this month, a dozen or so enemies went to Wangying, three li from Dan'gai, to loot. Wang then led his guerrilla squad there. As they reached the east gate, they saw five or six hundred laborers being lined up by two enemies, while the rest of the enemies were sitting around the roadside drinking. Old Wang thought that throwing grenades would hurt the laborers, so he fired a few shots at the drinking enemies. Hearing the gunshots, the enemies fled in a panic, and the laborers took the opportunity to escape. The masses all said, "If you hadn't come, we would have been ruined!" On the 4th, they drove away the enemies who went to Luying to loot. The enemies demanded conscripts from each village, ten from each jia (ten households), as well as 2,000 jin of wheat, 50 jin of oil, 50 jin of salt, 5,000 jin of grass, and 30 chicks, and gave them two days to organize a puppet regime, with a secretary and a bao chief for each village. Based on this, Wang Zhiyin and the others went to each village to hold meetings, ensuring that no one would become a puppet village chief. The notes issued by the enemies were all sent to the district for the district to handle. All the villages executed this well, and the enemies gained nothing. The masses all said, "The higher the mountain, the more prominent the plain." On the 5th, Wang Zhiyin's squad went to Luying to hold a meeting. As they entered the village, more than twenty enemies had just returned from Liuli and surrounded them. The Dan'gai militia, hearing the news, immediately came with guns, and the enemies fled in a hurry.

　　汪之印同他的游击小组
  　冀鲁豫通讯
    在敌人第三次占领郓城以后，汪之印同志和他的游击小组李权敬、单孟瑞、任廷三、李义套共五人，仍是坚持地区，和敌人打游击，执行了拿枪分田。汪同志在敌人前两次占领郓城时，都因坚持游击战而获得了模范，这次他是在单垓小区坚持。单垓小区有×个村，离城最近的村有八里地，而郓城城周围却住满了敌人。他们五人是在敌人占领郓城后第二天便出现在单垓街上，群众看见了自己人，还没走，兴奋的拉着他们的手嘱咐说：“你们可别走啦，不要让孬种来吓唬俺！”那天午后，有四个“还乡团”听说游击小组在村里，吓得张慌的逃走了。本月三日，有十几个敌人到离单垓三里地的王营抢东西，而汪便带领他的游击小组前去，他们刚到东门时，看见五、六百民夫正由两个敌人吆喝着站队，其余敌人都在路旁围坐吃酒。老汪想如果掷手榴弹会伤害民夫的，于是朝着吃酒的敌人打了几枪，敌人一听枪声，仓慌逃窜，民夫们也乘机逃散。群众都说：“不是你们来，俺们都毁了！”四日又打跑了去鲁营抢东西的敌人，敌人向各村要壮丁，每甲（每甲十户）十名，另外麦子二千斤，油五十斤、盐五十斤、草五千斤、小鸡三十个，并限两日内组织起伪政权，每村一书记、一保长。根据这些，汪之印等便到各村开会，保证谁也不准当伪村长，敌人开的条子，一律送到区，由区处理，各村都执行得很好，敌人毫无所获。群众都说：“越有高山，越显平地”。五日那天，汪之印小组到鲁营去开会，一进村，刚从六里回来了二十多个敌人，把他们包围，单垓民兵闻讯，马上持枪赶来，敌人慌忙逃窜。
