What Should Be Noted When Planting Wheat?
	Xi Fengzhou
	This year, we need to plant a large amount of wheat. Before sowing, there are some preparatory works that need attention. How should we pay attention to them?
	First, prepare the wheat seeds. As the saying goes, "Rather starve my mother than eat the seed grain," which shows that seeds are a major concern for farmers. However, it is now the White Dew season. According to investigations, many people still do not have wheat seeds, especially the newly emancipated farmers. With increased land, they did not save enough wheat seeds in the first half of the year. If appropriate adjustments and solutions are not made, it will hinder wheat sowing and cause irreparable losses! According to past experience, the way to solve the seed difficulty is, for small quantities, to organize the masses to borrow and exchange in neighboring villages or within the village. For large quantities, it is best for the cooperatives to solve it uniformly. In the past, cooperatives in various regions played a significant role in adjusting seeds. Some regions also use a portion of public grain to subsidize the shortage of wheat seeds, which is also an adoptable method. No matter what method is used to solve the seed problem, it is necessary to strictly select wheat seeds to prevent or reduce wheat diseases next year. This is because the yellow dwarf disease (yellow rust) of wheat was prevalent in this region the year before last. The loss of wheat due to this disease was the most serious in more than 60 years. This year, black dwarf disease (bunt) of wheat has occurred again in some areas, and the loss is not small. After two years of widespread observation and proof, Baiheshangtou wheat has the strongest resistance to yellow dwarf disease. This wheat is also known as Duck Beak wheat in the Xingtai area. In order to prevent yellow dwarf, it is really necessary to promote it. Last year, all awned wheat varieties had poorer resistance to yellow dwarf disease, especially Xiaobaimang wheat, which was more susceptible to yellow dwarf disease. Some fields only yielded a few liters per mu. Attention should be paid to selection when planting wheat this year. Black dwarf disease of wheat is transmitted by germs through the seeds. When planting wheat this year, it is necessary to select wheat that has not suffered from black dwarf disease as seed. If you can master the hot water seed treatment technique, disinfecting the wheat seeds with hot water can further prevent the occurrence of black dwarf disease of wheat.
	Second, prepare more fertilizer and apply base fertilizer, because wheat has a long growing period. After sowing, it will continue to develop, produce more tillers, and form more ears. If the base fertilizer is not applied or is insufficient, the "tillering ability" of the wheat will weaken, and the yield will be greatly reduced.
	When wheat encounters sufficient rainfall during its growth period, the effect of the base fertilizer will be even greater. According to the wheat harvest experience in the Taihang District in 1944, wheat fields with sufficient base fertilizer often yielded twice as much as those without base fertilizer. The tense autumn harvest is approaching, so seize the gap before autumn to step up the preparation of fertilizers and apply a large amount of base fertilizer!
	Third, all land that is to be planted with wheat should be plowed and harrowed in a timely manner, so that it can be quickly sown in the event of timely rainfall. This will prevent the delay of wheat sowing due to poor land preparation. This year, because of the large amount of replanting of autumn vegetables, as long as there is rain, wheat can be intercropped in general vegetable fields and wide-row late autumn crops.
	"Good rain in the dog days makes for good wheat planting." This saying is correct, but it should not be misunderstood that a large amount of wheat cannot be planted this year if there is no heavy rain in the dog days. As long as there is rain at the time of wheat planting this year and in the coming winter and spring, the wheat will still have a good harvest. Moreover, people who have been planting wheat for a long time also have this experience.

### 种麦应注意些什么？

　　种麦应注意些什么？
    席凤洲
    今年要大量种麦，在播种以前，有些准备工作需要注意。应怎样注意呢？
    要准备麦种，俗语说：“饿死老娘，不吃种粮”，说明种子是农家一件大事。可是，现在已到了白露节，据调查有很多群众还没有麦种，特别是新翻身的农民，土地增加了，前半年没有留下很多麦种，如果不加以适当调剂与解决，就会妨碍小麦下种，造成不可补偿的损失！据过去经验，解决种子困难的办法，如果是小的数量，可以组织群众在邻村或本村互借互换。要是大的数量，最好由合作社统一解决。因过去各地合作社，对于调剂种子，曾起了很大作用。有些地区抽用公粮一部补助麦种的不足，也是可采用的办法。无论用什么办法解决麦种，都需要严格的选择麦种，防止明年小麦不生病害或少生病害，因本区前年普遍发生小麦黄疸病（黄锈病），小麦因这种病害的损失，为六十余年以来最严重的一次。今年部分地区又发生小麦黑疸病（黑穗病），损失也不小。经过两年的普遍观察和证明，白和尚头小麦是抗黄疸病最强，这种小麦在邢台一带又名鸭子嘴小麦，为了防止黄疸，实有推广的必要。去年凡是带芒小麦，抗黄疸病均较差，尤其是小白芒麦生黄疸病更怕人，有的一亩地才打了几升，今年种麦时就需要加以选择。小麦的黑疸病，是病菌经过种籽传染的，今年种麦时，要选择没有生过黑疸病的小麦作麦种。如果能掌握温汤浸种的技术，把麦种用热水消消毒，更能防止小麦黑疸病的发生。
    要多准备肥料上底粪，因为麦子的生长期很长，种下以后，还要继续发放、多起头、多结穗。如果不上底粪或底粪上的不足，将来麦子的“分蘖力”就会变弱，在产量上也要减少很大的收成。
    麦子在生长期间，遇到雨水充足，底粪发挥的作用更要大。按太行区四四年的麦收经验，上足底粪的麦田，常比不上底粪的麦田，产量上增加一倍。现在紧张的秋收，将要到来，要抓紧秋前的空隙，加紧准备肥料，大量上底粪！
    凡是准备种麦的土地，应及时耕好耙好，一遇应时天雨，就可很快下种，不会因土地准备不好，延迟了小麦的下种。今年的一般秋庄稼，因下种时期不同，形成过早或过晚的收获时，这样，就需要一面收秋，一面送粪翻地，一面突击种麦。
    今年因为补种的秋菜很多，只要有了雨，一般的菜地和宽行的晚秋庄稼，都可以套种小麦。
    “伏里有雨好种麦”，这句话说的是对的，但不能误认为今年伏天没大雨就不能大量种麦了，只要今年种麦时和今冬明春有雨，麦子同样会收成很好，而且，过去久种麦的人，也有这样的经验。
