Strictly Check Stance and Style
    Today is "September 1st" (likely referencing a specific anniversary or event in China), and our newspaper publishes the Xinhua News Agency's editorial "Learning from the Self-Criticism of the Jin-Sui Daily" and the General Editorial Department's special article "Tempering Our Stance and Style." These two documents are of historical significance for the construction of the people's news undertaking. The general spirit of these documents is to call on all journalists to immediately engage in a self-transformation study movement, use the weapon of open self-criticism to thoroughly examine and correct the stance of every journalist in the land reform, overcome all improper styles, and better train our news army so that it can better serve the people.
    All our region's journalists should respond to this call with great enthusiasm and immediately conduct a rigorous self-examination.

    It should be clearly recognized that in the land reform movement, due to the failure to face up to the just actions of the peasants, the failure to attach importance to absorbing the just demands of the peasants (especially the poor peasants), the loss of stance, or the instability of stance, speaking up for the landlords, and affecting the thorough emancipation of the peasants, all exist more or less in our news interviews and editing work. Writing things that are clearly not beneficial to the peasants as if they are very beneficial to the peasants; writing things that the peasants (especially the poor peasants) do not agree with as if all the peasants fully agree, such as the landlord's land donation in Boyan, Wu'an last autumn, which was strongly opposed by the villagers after it was published; even exaggerating the facts, fabricating things out of thin air, reporting things that only happened in a few villages as things that happened in a region, such as a certain branch reporting that the entire region had restarted the review and re-examination, but in reality, the region was only carrying out sporadic re-examinations. This kind of irresponsible and unrealistic "from the armchair" style is also quite serious, some are even very serious, and there are also individual degenerate elements who stand on the opposing side, attack the peasants, or steal the fruits of the masses' struggle. Now, the movement to check stance and check ideology has spread to all departments and corners in the whole region. Our journalists must seize the opportunity to check carefully and conscientiously, and must not ignore it. Whoever ignores it will fall behind.

    This inspection, on the one hand, relies on the true consciousness of journalists, carries out self-examination and mutual examination, earnestly digs out the air-raid shelters in thought and action that are connected with the landlords, and earnestly confesses the facts and thoughts that are affected by the landlord's ideology, making it impossible for them to serve the people well, and even harming the interests of the peasants; on the other hand, it is necessary to learn from the experience of the Jin-Sui Daily, launch an open, mass, and thorough inspection. All "from the armchair" phenomena and untrue reports that lose their stance should be publicly subjected to sharp liquidation and exposure by the people of the entire region. Our hope is that the people's newspapers should be handed over to the people for review. We should sincerely accept all the opinions raised by the people, and we should humbly review all the criticisms and accusations made by the people. Anything that harms the interests of the people should be publicly admitted to the masses. Because our newspapers and every journalist are the people's servants, they should be handed over to the people for supervision and identification. Any psychology of fearing open self-criticism should be overcome. The newspaper's correspondents are also the people's servants and should actively participate in this inspection movement, conduct introspection and self-examination among the masses, and organize the masses to inspect our region's news work.

　　严格检查立场与作风
    今天是“九一”节，本报发表了新华社社论“学习晋绥日报的自我批评”及总社编辑部专论“锻炼我们的立场与作风”两个对于人民新闻事业建设具有历史意义的文献，这两个文献的总的精神，是号召所有新闻工作者立即投入一个改造自己的学习运动，运用公开的自我批评的武器，彻底检查与端正每一个新闻工作者在土地改革中的立场，克服一切不正派的作风，把我们这一支新闻军队锻炼得更好，使它更好的为人民服务。
    我全区新闻工作者应以高度的热情，响应这一号召，立即进行对自己的严格检查。
    应明确认识，在土地改革运动中，由于不敢正视农民的正义行动，不重视吸收农民（特别是贫农）的正义要求，失掉立场，或立场不稳，为地主张目，影响了农民彻底翻身，都在我们的新闻采访与编辑工作中或多或少的存在；把明明对农民无利的事情，写成了对农民十分有利的事情；把农民（特别是贫农）不同意的事情，写成全体农民十分赞同，如去秋武安伯延地主献田，登出后该村农民十分反对；甚至夸大事实，无中生有，把只是几村的事情，报导为一个地区的事情，如某分社报导全区重起复查，实际该区尚只进行零星复查，此种不负责任，不实际的“客里空”作风，表现得也相当严重，有些还十分严重，个别站在敌对立场，打击农民，或窃取群众斗争果实的堕落分子，也不是没有。现全区查立场、查思想运动，已普及到各部门各角落，我新闻工作者一定要把握时机，仔细的查，认真的查，千万不能漠视无睹，谁漠视谁就会掉队。
    这一检查，一方面依靠新闻工作者真正的自觉，开展自我检查与相互检查，认真挖掉思想上、行动上、与地主有联系的防空洞，并认真坦白由于地主思想影响，使自己不能为人民很好服务，甚至损害农民利益的事实与思想；另外一方面，要学习晋绥日报的经验，发动公开地群众性地彻底地检查。一切“客里空”现象和丧失立场的不真实报导，都应公开让全区人民予以尖锐的清算与揭发，我们希望是，人民的报纸，应该交给人民审查，凡人民对我们提的意见，我们都应予以诚恳接受，人民对我们的批评和检举，我们都应虚心检讨，凡损害人民利益的，都应公开向群众承认错误。因为我们的报纸及每一个新闻工作者都是人民的勤务员，应该交给人民监督与鉴定，任何畏惧公开自我批评的心理，都是应该克服的。报纸的通讯员，也是人民的勤务员，在这次检查运动中应积极参加，在群众中进行反省检讨，并组织群众对我区新闻工作的检查。
