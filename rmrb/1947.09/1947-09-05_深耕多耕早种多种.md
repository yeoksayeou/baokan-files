Deep Ploughing, Multiple Ploughing, Early Planting, Multiple Planting

[Report from this newspaper in Licheng] After the Fourth District's summary of hoeing and seedling enhancement for increased production, in order to actively prepare for expanding wheat fields and compensating for lean years, and to enable every household to reach the goal of "耕三余一" (cultivating three and saving one); in order to powerfully support the front lines, the Shiban base point convened a meeting of key village cadres on the 27th to study how to carry out fertilizer accumulation methods and improve planting techniques for increased production. During the discussion, Bai Chuanhe, the political director of Shiban, said, "Plant wheat early, the earlier the wheat is planted, the greater the harvest, and the earlier it can be harvested." He also said, "Peaches and apricots fill the fields, locust flowers come next summer. This year's locust flowers are plentiful, and next year's wheat will surely be abundant." Yang Jiyuan, the political director of Pingtou, said, "People deceive the land, the land deceives the belly, wheat eats a plough. Wheat fields must be well, thoroughly, and deeply ploughed in order to grow better crops and harvest more grain." In this way, everyone's ideas and demands for early planting, multiple planting, multiple ploughing, and deep ploughing were unified. Duan Yongfu, the village chief of Songhou, said, "This year's spring was deep, and autumn will surely be cool early, so wheat should be planted during the White Dew solar term. In order to harvest more grain, we will plant 190 mu this year." According to statistics from the ten villages of the Shiban base point, the wheat field will be expanded by 2,505 mu. After everyone clarified the ideas of increasing production through multiple ploughing, deep ploughing, early planting, and multiple planting, they further studied fertilizer accumulation methods and improved techniques, putting forward the slogan: "Doing business without capital, farming without fertilizer is just messing around." The discussed methods are: (1) Cut artemisia and edge grass, push weeds and reclaim wasteland, mix them with soil, and water them with night soil to make them easier to rot; (2) Pick seeds of Vitex negundo, stir-fry them in a pot, and grind them to a pulp. When mixed with night soil, the effect is greatest. One seed of Vitex negundo can yield as much oil as a copper coin. Two sheng per mu is enough; (3) Collect cow dung, dry it in the sun on rocks, and smoke it with white grass or cypress branches to make fertilizer that is both drought-resistant and can absorb shade; (4) Cut cypress branches, dry them in the sun, stir-fry them until dry, and grind them into powder. This can kill insects, loosen the soil, and has hot fertilizer properties. It is suitable for cold and low-lying areas at the foot of the hills. Three dou per mu is required; (5) Scrape soil from the edges of the fields to cover the land. As the saying goes: "Soil overturns soil, hitting stone five times;" (6) Other general methods include sweeping street soil, piling sheep manure, composting wasteland, diligently padding the pens, accumulating more sewage, scraping wasteland, sweeping pigeon manure, oil cakes, beating kang soil, night soil compost, which are suitable for flat land. Technically, for changing valley land to wheat, first harrow it once, spread fertilizer, then plough it again, and then plant. Corn land is harvested late, so use dibbling to plant, planting along the rows, and using a one-legged seed drill. However, before planting, it is necessary to universally hoe once to ensure that there are no weeds in the field, making it easy to plant. Especially for corn land, because it is not ploughed, the last hoeing must be deep, and the corn root holes should be dug out less, forming a flat and slow heap shape to prevent eddies from excessive rain and weak wheat seedlings. Whether planting on fallow or changing crops, a two-legged seed drill is used. The wheat is well-ventilated, which can increase the yield, and corn and other crops can be planted again next year. This solves the masses' concerns that if the wheat fields are expanded, there will be no autumn fields to plant next year. The ploughing technique should be one lengthwise ploughing and two crosswise ploughings to thoroughly plough the land. Soak the seeds with salt water, two qian of salt per dou of water, float up the blighted ones and remove them, cool them, then soak them in warm water for five minutes, cool them, then soak them in boiling water, and then cool them. Then, for a small dou of wheat seeds, use four liang of wine to rub them. This is drought-resistant, the stems are hard, and the wheat skin is thin, which is most suitable for land at the foot of the hills, and can yield two more dou per mu. Another soaking method is to rub each dou of wheat with half a jin of rosin after soaking, but it should not be left overnight, and should be rubbed as it is planted. This can kill insects and loosen the soil. At present, the fertilizer accumulation and production increase movement has been widely carried out in the base point. Houjia Village plans to accumulate 11,825 loads of fertilizer in half a month, and Shiban plans to accumulate 6,250 loads of fertilizer; Langou cuts 400 bundles of artemisia a day, which can compost 800 loads; Shiban carries 120 loads of sheep manure and 80 loads of composted wasteland a day.

　　深耕多耕早种多种
    【本报黎城讯】四区在锄苗增产总结后，为了积极准备扩大麦田，补救歉收年成，使家家户户达到耕三余一奋斗方向；为有力支援前线，石板基点于二十七日召开了各村主要干部会议，研究如何开展集肥办法与提高下种技术的增产运动。在讨论中石板政治主任白川合说：“早点直麦，麦早种上，收成大，也能早收，”又说：“桃杏满下田，槐花来年夏。今年的槐花很多，明年的麦子必定丰收。”平头政治主任杨积元说：“人哄地皮，地哄肚皮，麦吃一张犁。麦地好好多多深耕，才能长更好庄稼，多打粮食。”这样集中起大家早种、多种、多耕、深耕一致的思想要求，松后村长段永富说：“今年春深，秋必凉早，交白露节就要种麦，为了多打粮食，今年要种一百九十亩。”石板基点十个村统计，扩大麦田二千五百零五亩。大家明确了多耕深耕早种多种的增产思想以后，又进一步研究积肥办法，提高技术，提出口号：“做买卖没本，种地没肥是打混。”讨论出办法是：（一）割蒿割边沿，推杂草推荒，和土拌了，用圊肥浇了，容易腐烂；（二）采荆籽，用锅炒了，磨烂，使圊拌起来，力量最大，一个荆籽能油一个铜元大，每亩二升就行；（三）把牛粪拾在石岩晒干，和白草，或柏枝，熏成肥，既耐旱又吃阴；（四）把柏枝割回晒干，炒干，碾碎，既能杀虫，又能松土，肥性热，宜上地冷的岭脚地，下洼地，一亩须三斗、（五）刮沿土垫地，俗语说：“土倒土打石五；”（六）其他一般扫街土，堆羊肥，沤荒，勤垫圈，多积污水，刮荒，扫鸽子肥，油饼，打炕土，圊堆肥，宜上平阳地。技术上，谷地改麦首先耙一次，撒下肥，再耕一次，后再种上。玉茭地收获迟，用点种，顺行栽，与一条腿耧种法，但在下种前必须普遍锄一次，保证地里没草，易于下种，特别玉茭地因不耕，最后的一锄要深锄，玉茭根圪洞要刨的少一些，成平漫堆形，防止雨多漩涡，麦苗不旺。种正、改茬都使用二条腿耧，麦既通风能多打，明年又能改种玉茭与其他作物。这样解决了群众怕麦田扩大了，明年没有秋田种的顾虑。耕的技术，要一顺耕，二横耕，才能耕透地。用盐水浸种，一斗水二钱盐，把秕的浮起捞去，凉干，再使温水浸五分钟，凉干，再使开水浸，再凉干后，一小斗麦籽用酒四两，搓一下，这样抗旱，杆硬，麦皮薄，最宜于岭脚地，每亩能多打二斗。另一种浸法，浸种后，每斗麦用半斤柏油搓一下，但不敢停夜，要随种随搓，这样既能杀虫又能松地。现在基点积肥增产运动已普遍开展，后家庄计划半个月积肥一万一千八百二十五驮，石板计划积肥六千二百五十驮；岚沟一天割蒿四百捆，能沤八百驮；石板一日担羊肥一百二十担，沤荒肥八十驮。（崇岐、树培）
