Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 7th. The Mizhi County People's Militia, in conjunction with the Workers' Militia, searched the high mountains and deep gullies to capture defeated soldiers of Chiang Kai-shek's 36th Division from the Shajiadian annihilation battle. From the 22nd to the 23rd of last month, they killed and captured 144 officers and soldiers, including Li Shuji, the radio station chief of the division headquarters, and seized 19 light machine guns. Another militia group recovered two mountain guns in the Shajiadian area.

Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 7th. Frontline reporter Wu Ren reported: After Chiang Kai-shek's 36th Division was annihilated, the reporter patrolled the battlefield. On the five to six *li* stretch from Changxinzhuang to Nizigou, he witnessed wheat, beans, flour, and salt looted by the bandits from the peasants, discarded everywhere in the mountain gullies and river embankments. Broken iron pots, water tanks, and burnt doors, windows, and chests were scattered all over. The crops on the south hill of Nizigou were trampled and eaten bare by Chiang Kai-shek's livestock. But even the most brutal villains were cowardly and shameful. On the same road, the bandits abandoned piles of backpacks, military pots, complete firearms and ammunition, and telecommunications equipment, as well as pumpkin slices that had not been put into the pot and pancakes that had not had time to be eaten. The corpses of Chiang Kai-shek's soldiers were lying haphazardly among them, each with a flowered back and chest to the ground, which was clearly the final punishment they received when they fled backwards. The reporter encountered groups of People's Liberation Army soldiers, who were all singing and laughing, carrying the mountain guns sent by the 165th Brigade. An old man was leading a prisoner. He said: "I saw him sneaking around in the mountains, and when I asked him who he was, he took out more than 100,000 yuan to ask me to let him go. As soon as I heard it, I understood. I told him to come with me, and he was so scared that he started crying." As he was saying this, the prisoner burst into tears again. This scene reminded me of the desperate wails of the wounded Chiang Kai-shek soldiers abandoned by Chiang Kai-shek's army in the mountain gullies when the battle had just ended last night. A Chiang Kai-shek officer who had laid down his weapons said seriously: "In the future, when you defeat Hu Zongnan until he is about to collapse, Hu Zongnan will cry even louder than this."

　　米脂县人民游击队
  　捕捉三十六师溃兵
    【新华社陕北七日电】米脂县游击队联合工人游击队，搜查高山深沟，捕捉沙家店歼灭战中蒋军三十六师溃兵，从上月二十二日至二十三日，已毙俘该师师部电台长李树吉以下官兵一百四十四名，缴获轻机枪十九挺。另一游击小组在沙家店地区搜获之山炮两门。
    【新华社西北七日电】前线记者午人报导：蒋军三十六师被歼后，记者巡行战场，从常新庄到泥子沟五、六里的路上，目睹山沟河堤到处抛弃着匪徒们从农民处掠夺来的麦子、豆子、面粉和食盐，遍地是破碎的铁锅、水缸以及烧焦了的门、窗、箱柜。泥子沟南山的庄稼，被蒋军牲口践踏啃食殆尽。但是最残暴的恶棍也懦怯得可耻，在同一条路上，匪徒们遗弃着成堆的背包、军用锅、完整的枪械弹药和电讯器材，并有未及上锅的南瓜片和没顾得上吃的烙饼。蒋军的尸体横七竖八地交杂其间，一个个都是背上带花胸部贴地，这分明是他们向后逃命时所得到的最后的惩罚。记者遇到成群的解放军战士，他们都唱着笑着，抬运着一六五旅送来的山炮。一个老乡解着一个俘虏走来，他说：“我在山上见他鬼鬼崇崇，问他是什么人，他掏出十几万元来叫我放走他，我一听就明白了，叫他跟我走，他就怕的哭起来，正说着，那个俘虏又一把鼻涕一把眼泪的大哭起来。这情景使我想起昨晚上战斗刚结束时，被蒋军遗弃在山沟里的蒋军伤兵绝望的嚎哭。一个放下武器的蒋军军官正经地说：“将来你们把胡宗南打得快垮时，胡宗南会哭的比这更难听哩。”
