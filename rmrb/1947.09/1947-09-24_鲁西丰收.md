Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 17th. A field reporter reports: Autumn crops in the Luxi Plain areas that were not affected by the Yellow River floods have yielded a bumper harvest. This year, Luxi has had favorable weather, with sorghum growing to over twelve feet tall, yielding an average of 300 jin per mu. Millet grows so deep it reaches the neck, with yields reaching 300 to 500 jin per mu, a good harvest unseen in years. Farmers harvest amidst the rumble of artillery fire. When encountering enemy situations, they hide in the thickets and maneuver with the Chiang bandits. After repelling the Chiang bandits, they drive four-wheeled carts fully loaded back home. Now, farmers are rushing to prepare provisions for the People's Liberation Army's counter-offensive.

    鲁西丰收
    【新华社华东前线十七日电】野战记者报导：鲁西平原未遭黄河水灾地区秋禾丰收。今年鲁西各地风调雨顺，高粱高长丈二，每亩平均收获三百斤，谷子深可及颈，每亩收获达三百至五百斤，为数年来未有之好年景。农民于隆隆炮声中收割，遇有敌情，便隐身树丛，与蒋匪周旋，待击退蒋匪即驾四轮大车满载而归。现农民均纷纷为解放军赶办反攻粮草。
