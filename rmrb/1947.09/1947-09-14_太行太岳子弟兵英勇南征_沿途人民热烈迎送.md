　　Xinhua News Agency, Jinji Lu Yu, 12th: Belated news: The troops under General Qin Jiwei of the Jinji Lu Yu Field Army of the People's Liberation Army held a grand oath-taking rally for the southward march on August 15th in a certain area of Taihang. Tens of thousands of representatives from all walks of life in Taihang and commanders and fighters of the troops gathered on the boundless plains. The people of Taihang presented silk banners as high as two zhang (approx. 6.6 meters), inscribed with "Taihang sons and daughters tie long tassels, cross the river southward to bind the azure dragon," waving proudly in the air. In the dim morning light, General Qin Jiwei and representatives from all walks of life reviewed the troops on horseback. Political Commissar Huang Zhen led the troops in taking an oath: "Serve the people wholeheartedly, bravely encircle and annihilate the enemy, not let a single enemy escape, love the people, help the people in the KMT-controlled areas to stand up, support land reform, eliminate Chiang Kai-shek, and establish an independent, peaceful, and democratic New China." Then General Qin Jiwei spoke, pointing out: "Today we swear to march south, Chairman Mao has given us an even greater task: to open up a new battlefield, fight out, annihilate the enemy, and liberate the fathers, brothers, and elders in the KMT-controlled areas." At this time, the slogan "Fight out!" resounded like thunder across the fields. Subsequently, Commander Lu Lin of the Taihang Military Region encouraged everyone to bravely complete the new task and guaranteed that the Taihang soldiers and civilians had the full strength to defend and expand the Taihang Liberated Area and protect the fruits of the people's liberation, and to support the front lines of the great counteroffensive. Comrade Du Runsheng of the Administrative Office represented six million people in guaranteeing that everyone would completely stand up, establish good households, and use all their strength to support the front lines. Deputy Commissioner Liu of the Fourth District proposed on the spot: I am willing to personally lead the laborers and militiamen to follow everyone and fight out. Wherever you go, we will follow. At this time, thunderstorms arrived, and the old cadres and old soldiers recalled that on the day of the oath-taking ceremony for the anti-Japanese war ten years ago, there was also such a thunderstorm, symbolizing the arrival of the revolutionary storm, and everyone felt even more excited.
　　
　　【People’s Daily, Taiyue, 13th】On the thousand-li road leading to the Yellow River, men and women of all ages in Taiyue, supporting the old and carrying the young, joyfully sent off Chen Geng's army southward. Every twenty or thirty li along the way from Yicheng to Jiyuan, there were reception stations. In addition, each village voluntarily set up tea stations and prepared meat dishes and white flour to treat their own soldiers marching south. Villages such as Yanshan in Yangcheng had already cleaned up their houses and yards a few days ago and vacated the main rooms to accommodate the troops. A few days ago, as soon as they learned that the troops had arrived, Yanshan Village formed teams and beat gongs and drums to welcome them from afar. Wang Xiaoqiao from Shangyi and others waited until dark and still did not see the troops arrive, so they lit lanterns and kept receiving them three li away from the village at Dachitou. The public blackboard newspaper in Nanciying published a special welcome issue, and there were also large slogans eight feet high and three feet wide, and from afar, one could see the words "Welcome the People's Liberation Army, cross the Yellow River," and so on. When the troops passed through Baijian Village, because the road was slippery after the rain, female heroine Zhang Mingqian and his wife hurriedly led the way, and their son automatically carried coal and earth from home to pave the road. On the same day, the iron pots of the Gaoping militiamen were broken, and the local people automatically sent them three. As soon as the troops entered the village, they scrambled to invite them to live in their houses. After the troops settled down in Yanshan, the men helped to settle the livestock, and the women fetched water, cooked meals, mended and washed clothes, and carried a pig and two loads of chickens and fruits. In the evening, a welcome and farewell meeting was held. When the troops set off, men and women helped carry luggage and backpacks, and held hands with their soldiers, reluctant to part. They sent them off one or two li away, and then met another village welcoming and sending them off. One village after another, one group after another, finally separated with "We wish you a victory and return, and meet again after defeating Chiang Kai-shek." In Jiyuan, along the Yellow River, a large amount of firewood, rice, noodles, meat, and vegetables had been prepared. In the third district alone, 30,000 people were working day and night to grind flour, etc., grinding 125,000 jin in one day and one night, and preparing 80,000 jin of firewood. In particular, the boatmen along the Yellow River have prepared furniture for crossing the river. Huang Xishi from Shaogong said, "I don't know anything else, but I've been playing with boats since I was a child." Therefore, the boatmen heroes of Du Balian wanted to compete with the boatmen who sent Liu and Deng's army across the river: "They proposed crossing the river in three minutes and seizing the first boat." In addition to serving tea and water, women also accompanied the army to send firewood to far away places. Zhao Zhulian, Li Fenglian and other twenty women from Linshan personally carried firewood, crossed the five-li-high mountain, crossed the half-person-deep river, and sent it to the reception station thirty li away, and everyone was busy welcoming and sending off until they reached the Yellow River.

　　太行太岳子弟兵英勇南征
  　沿途人民热烈迎送
    【新华社晋冀鲁豫十二日电】迟到消息：解放军晋冀鲁豫野战军秦基伟将军所部，于八月十五日在太行某地举行誓师南征大会，太行各界代表来宾及该部队指战员数万人，汇集在一望无垠的平原上，太行人民献锦旗高达二丈，上书“太行子弟结长缨，跨河南征缚苍龙”，凌空招展。在晨光熹微中，秦基伟将军及各界来宾代表纵马阅兵后，由黄镇政委领导所部宣誓：“全心全意为人民服务，勇敢的包围歼灭敌人，不让一个敌人逃跑，爱护人民，援助蒋管区人民翻身，拥护土地改革，消灭蒋介石，建立独立和平民主的新中国。”继由秦基伟将军讲话，指出：“今天誓师南征，毛主席已把更重大的任务交给我们：开辟新战场，打出去，歼灭敌人，解放蒋管区的父老兄弟。”此时全场“打出去”的口号有如雷鸣声震原野。接着太行军区鲁林司令员慰勉大家勇敢去完成新的任务，并保证太行军民完全有力量保卫与扩大太行解放区及保卫人民翻身果实，支援大反攻前线。行署杜润生同志代表六百万人民保证使人人翻透身，建立好家务，用一切力量支援前线。四分区刘副专员当场提出：愿亲自带领民夫民兵跟着大家打出去，你们到那里，我们跟到那里。此时雷雨交至，老干部老战士们回忆十年前抗日誓师出征那天，也是这样雷雨，象征着革命风暴的来临，大家愈感兴奋。
    【本报太岳十三日电】在通达黄河的千里道路上，太岳各地男女，扶老携小，欢送陈赓大军南渡，从翼城到济源等地沿路每隔二十里或三十里，均设有招待站，此外各村又自动设立茶水站及准备下肉菜、白面，为自己南下的子弟兵饯行。阳城岩山等村，已在前几天就将自己房院整理清洁，并让出正房来，要留部队住。早几天一得到部队已经到来，岩山村便结队打着锣鼓远迎。上义王小巧等到天黑还不见部队到来，便点上灯笼，一直接到离村三里地的大赤头。南次营的大众黑板报上出欢迎特刊，又有了八尺高、三尺宽的大标语，远远就看到“欢送人民解放军，打过黄河”等字样。部队经过白涧村时，因雨后路滑，女英雄张明遣夫妇，急忙带路，儿子自动从家里抬煤土垫路。当天高平民兵跌坏了铁锅三口，当地老百姓便自动送他们三口。部队一进村后，争相邀请住自己的房。岩山待部队住下后，男人帮着安置牲口，妇女找来烧水作饭补洗衣服，又抬了一口猪和两担鸡与水果。晚上开欢迎欢送大会，在部队起程时，男男女女都帮着担行李，背背包，和子弟兵拉着手，依依不舍。送至一、二里地外，接着又碰另一村迎接送行，一村接一村，一伙送一伙，终于在“祝你们打胜仗回来，打败蒋介石再见面”下分别了。沿黄河的济源，已准备好大量柴火米面肉菜，仅三区有三万人在日夜赶着磨面等工作，一天一夜就磨了十二万五千斤，准备柴火八万斤，特别是沿黄河的水手已准备下过河的家具。捎公黄习时说：“别的不会，可是玩船从小到现在。”于是，杜八联的水手英雄要与送刘邓大军过河的水手比一比：“提出了三分钟过河，抢渡第一船。”妇女除招待茶水，并随军到远处送柴火。临山妇女赵株莲、李凤莲等二十余人，亲自担了柴火，翻过五里高的大山，渡过半人深的大河，送到三十里地外的招待站上，一直到黄河边上，个个忙着欢迎，又忙着欢送。
