　　Shahe First District Strives for Simultaneous Harvesting and Planting
  　Plans Large-Scale Intercropping
    [Report from this newspaper, Shahe] At a cadre meeting in the First District, methods to increase the ability to survive the famine next year were discussed. The most effective method is to plant wheat on a large scale this year. Based on past wheat planting, the entire district can plant 60 percent of wheat fields this year, and strive to exceed that. Specific plans: In the rear area, foxtail millet will be harvested starting in early August (lunar calendar). Wheat fields should be plowed twice completely. There is little land in the rear, but there are many livestock and sheep, so there is no shortage of fertilizer. The Daqian Joint Defense has already prepared 50 dan of manure per mu of wheat land, and it can be planted around August 25th (Cold Dew). In the front area, millet will not mature until the end of August. Harvesting and plowing together, wheat planting will be delayed until the Frost's Descent period. Planting wheat too late will not only reduce the harvest, but it is also unknown if there will be any harvest at that time. If everyone rushes to plant at that time, it will not be possible to plant everything. Therefore, the only way is to intercrop some timely wheat in the millet ridges first (this part of the millet field needs to be hoed three times). It is better to act early. The villages of Xielu and Jian'ao have experience in intercropping. First, they dig ditches in the millet ridges, apply base fertilizer, and sow the wheat seeds and bury them. When the autumn millet is harvested, the wheat will also emerge. After cutting the millet, use a hoe to shovel up the stubble, and topdressing can also be applied. It is planned to intercrop 30 percent, and the remaining 30 percent will be plowed and planted as harvesting proceeds. Mobilize labor from the rear to support the disaster area on a large scale, and a concentrated plowing of land for wheat planting can be completed in advance, before the Frost's Descent period. In addition to human and animal manure, the district's 900 mu of indigo stalks have been composted into fertilizer, which can also strengthen 900 mu of wheat land. Turning the roots of the original indigo land will also be very beneficial. There is a shortage of manure in the front, so we are now rushing to cut artemisia and collect vitex seeds to make fertilizer. In addition to preparing some seeds ourselves, the cooperative is trying to purchase good wheat seeds from other villages, and a emulation campaign is also planned.
    In addition, the five villages in the Wanquan River defense area of the Third District have formulated a plan to guarantee the planting of 25 qing of straight wheat. Dong Gequan Village requires each household to plant at least five mu in the millet ridges (also small millet seedlings). Because the defense villages start cutting grass and composting fertilizer after hoeing three times, each laborer must compost enough fertilizer for two mu of wheat land. The masses said, "Planting wheat without fertilizer is just a waste of time." (Quan Ren)
    [Report from this newspaper, Xiyang] In late August, the Fifth District convened an expanded cadre meeting at the district and village levels, proposing to plant wheat on a large scale to make up for the famine. After discussion, everyone decided to set different wheat planting requirements according to different villages: First, villages that have a habit of planting wheat, such as Taishang, Min'an, and Hexia, etc. (ten villages), require each person to plant one mu, with a total of 3,417 people, guaranteeing the planting of 3,417 mu of wheat. Second, villages that generally plant wheat, such as Zhangjiazhuang, Nanzhuang, Donggou, and Xiabiguan, etc. (four villages), require each person to plant eight fen, with a total of 2,525 people, guaranteeing the planting of 2,020 mu of wheat. Third, villages that plant very little wheat, such as Kucheng, Taoqu, and Gaoluo, etc. (eight villages), require each person to plant half a mu, with a total of 6,146 people, guaranteeing the planting of 3,073 mu of wheat. Fourth, villages that have no habit of planting wheat at all, such as Liugou, Zhaibei, and Xiaodongyu, etc. (nine villages), require each person to plant three fen of wheat, with a total of 3,893 people, guaranteeing the planting of 1,169.9 mu of wheat. The above-mentioned areas in the entire district plant a total of 10,579.9 mu of wheat. It is estimated that each mu will yield five dou next year, for a total of 5,020 shi, which can help survive for more than a month. Regarding the wheat seed problem, in addition to the masses adjusting it themselves, the cooperative is responsible for purchasing it. The district office saves five shi of wheat and lends it to the masses. Now, everyone is vigorously accumulating fertilizer and carrying out various preparations. (Ziyou, Xinying)

　　沙河一区争取收种两不误
  　计划大量就拢插种
    【本报沙河讯】一区干部会上，讨论增加明年渡荒力量的办法，只有今年大量种麦最为有效，根据过去种麦情况，今年全区可种百分之六十的麦田，并争取超过，具体计划：后半区大谷子，阴历八月初即开始收割，种麦地要全部犁两遍；后边地少，牲口和羊很多，肥料不缺，大欠联防每亩麦地已准备好五十担粪了，到八月二十五（寒露）前后即可种完。前边小苗到八月底才能成熟，连收带犁，赶种麦就到霜降节了，种麦太晚，不但收成减少，到那时还不知有没有，都挤到那时，也种不过来，因此唯一办法是在谷垄内先插种一部应时麦子（这部谷地要锄三遍），先下手为强，抓住一点是一点。卸路、渐凹两村群众过去插种有经验，先把谷垄里挑成沟，上了底粪，撒进麦籽埋好即可，等到收秋麦子也就出来了，割了谷子用锄把茬铲起，还能上追粪。计划插种百分之三十，其余百分之三十随收随犁随种。发动后边人畜劳力大量支援灾区，突击犁地种麦，可以提前完成，在霜降以前即可种完。肥料除人畜肥外，全区九百亩靛秆已沤成肥，还能壮九百亩麦地，原种靛地根翻下去也很壮。前边粪缺，现即突击割蒿，采荆籽造肥。种籽除自己准备一部外，合作社想法到外村购买好麦种，并计划掀起一个立功竞赛运动。
    又三区万泉河防五个村已订出计划，保证种直麦子二十五顷，东葛泉村每户最少要往谷垄里种五亩（也是小谷苗），因防村于锄罢三遍就下手割草沤粪，每个劳力要沤二亩麦地的粪，群众说：“种麦不上粪，就是瞎胡混。”（全仁）
    【本报昔阳讯】五区在八月下旬，召开区村扩干会议，提出大量种麦弥补荒歉，经大家讨论决定，按不同村庄订出不同的种麦要求：第一、过去有种麦习惯的村庄，如台上、民安、河下等十村，要求每口人种一亩，共三千四百一十七口人，保证种三千四百一十七亩麦。第二、过去种麦一般的村庄，如张家庄、南庄、东沟、霞碧观等四村，要求每口人种八分，共二千五百二十五口人，保证种二千零二十亩麦。第三、过去种麦很少的村庄，如库城、桃躯、皋落等八个村，要求每口人种半亩，共六千一百四十六口人，保证种三千零七十三亩麦。第四、过去根本没有种麦习惯的村庄，如柳沟、寨背、小东峪等九村，要求每口人种麦三分，共三千八百九十三口人，保证种一千一百六十九亩九分麦。以上全区共种麦一万零五百七十九亩九分，估计明年每亩地收五斗，共能收五千零二十石，能渡一个多月荒。麦种问题，除群众自行调剂外，并由合作社负责购买，区公所节约麦子五石，也借给群众，现正在大量积肥与进行各种准备中。（子由、新颖）
