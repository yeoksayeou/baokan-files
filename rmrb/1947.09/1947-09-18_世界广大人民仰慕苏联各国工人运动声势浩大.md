　　On the eve of the opening of the Second United Nations General Assembly, the international reactionaries, led by the United States, are trying to stir up a countercurrent to amend the United Nations Charter and overturn the veto power, in order to undermine this international organization that maintains post-war peace. But in the Soviet Union, the whole nation is celebrating the 800th anniversary of the founding of its capital, Moscow. Grand rallies and parades are being held everywhere in the Soviet Union, overflowing with joy and singing the praises of a new life of peace, democracy, and freedom. On that day, Stalin delivered an important congratulatory speech, powerfully pointing out that Moscow "is the vanguard in the struggle for friendship and lasting peace among the people of the world, and the vanguard against the instigators of a new war." This shows how resolute and full of confidence the Soviet Union's policy of defending post-war peace and opposing the reactionaries' instigation of war is. At the same time, the Soviet working people are welcoming this festival with new victories in production, making a significant contribution to the cause of world peace. The production plan for August has once again been greatly exceeded as usual, and many factories have already begun to engage in next year's production. Many workers have even created miracles on the production front. Kusni Tzova, a female worker in a factory in Moscow, ingeniously invented a new method of improving the technological process. Under her leadership, a work team has gloriously completed the entire new Five-Year Plan. Currently, the Kusni Tzova movement is being carried out in various factories in the Soviet Union, which is a guarantee for the early and victorious completion of the new Five-Year Plan.
　　The Soviet Union's resolute policy of defending peace, as well as the labor enthusiasm of the country's people who love their motherland at the risk of their lives, has become the hope of mankind and has won the deep sympathy and admiration of the broad masses of people in the world. Recently, progressive individuals and groups from many countries, such as the Italian Women's Delegation, the delegation of the French General Confederation of Labor, the famous French writer Agong, and the Mexican social leader Mancy Siddon, have continued to flock to the Soviet Union for visits. The number of British people who want to strengthen friendship with the Soviet Union is also increasing. According to a poll conducted by the London "Observatory," in London alone, four out of six people expressed pro-Soviet sentiments. At the same time, the number of people who expressed goodwill towards the United States has dropped from 58 percent in 1945 to 21 percent last year. This reflects the expansion of Soviet influence and how the people of the world are eagerly looking forward to justice and peace.
　　Following the large-scale strikes in Britain and France, Italy has also seen an outbreak of a large-scale strike movement by 1.2 million workers in the past week to protest the reactionary economic policies and soaring prices of the authorities. The scale of the strike has alarmed the American master of the reactionaries. The US ambassador to Italy even advocated that "force should be used against" it if necessary. At present, US imperialism is creating excuses to enable the US occupation forces to stay in Italy for a long time, in order to save the reactionary rule of Italy, which is teetering on the brink of collapse. In the past week, the strike wave in Britain and France has continued.
　　On the other hand, the Anglo-American Ruhr coal production conference, which has lasted for quite a long time, has announced a joint communiqué of the so-called agreement. The masters of Wall Street expressed their arrogant satisfaction; but London showed great panic and shock. People in financial and political circles were shocked that "the control of German steel factories and international trade will gradually fall into the hands of the United States"; public opinion also issued "unfavorable criticisms," and explained that because the Labour government's dream of fantasizing about American aid to save its economic crisis has not awakened, and the pressure exerted by the United States took the opportunity, although it forced Britain to accept the American plan and let the United States "share equally" the management rights of the Ruhr coal mines, this "agreement" under pressure, and the series of adverse consequences it will produce, will make the Anglo-American struggle around this issue more complicated. At the same time, this agreement has also caused resistance from the Netherlands, Luxembourg, and other countries that have partial interests in the Ruhr coal mines, and they have expressed their opposition and demanded to participate in the control of the Ruhr. Here, it must be pointed out that the anti-American sentiment of the British people is growing day by day. The "Observatory" poll mentioned above is an example. British Labour Party progressive parliamentarians Crossman and the famous writer Taylor have also recently tried their best to criticize the United States, denouncing it as "a complete imperialist country" and "the biggest enemy of democracy." In addition, the United States' attempt to abandon the decision of the Moscow Conference and strive to monopolize North Korea has run into a serious nail. Under the solemn rebuttal and refusal of the Soviet government, the United States had to "announce a postponement" of the four-nation conference discussing the Korean issue, which it had convened without authorization, thus making a fool of itself.

### 世界广大人民仰慕苏联各国工人运动声势浩大

　　世界广大人民仰慕苏联各国工人运动声势浩大
    当第二届联合国大会开幕的前夕，以美国为首的国际反动派，正图掀起一股修改联合国宪章推翻否决权的逆流，以破坏这一维护战后和平的国际机构。但在苏联，全国人民正狂欢庆祝其首都莫斯科建城八百周年纪念，全苏各地到处举行盛大的集会游行，它们洋溢着喜悦，为和平民主自由的新生活而高歌。当天，斯大林发表了重要祝词，有力指出：莫斯科“是争取全世界人民友谊与持久和平斗争的先驱，是反对新战争煽动者的先驱。”这显示苏联保卫战后和平与反对反动派挑拨战争的政策，是如何坚决而充满信心。同时，苏联劳动人民则以生产的新胜利来迎接这一节目，来对世界的和平事业作一番重大的贡献。八月份的生产计划又照例大大超过了，许多工厂已开始从事明年的生产了，许多工人更创造了生产战线上的奇迹，莫斯科某工厂的女工库斯尼佐娃，她天才地发明了改进技术过程的新方法，在她领导下的一个工作队，已经光荣地完成了整个新五年计划。目前，苏联各工厂正开展库斯尼佐娃运动，这是新五年计划提前胜利完成的保证。
    苏联坚决保卫和平的政策，以及该国人民奋不顾身热爱祖国的劳动热情，已成了人类希望之寄托，博得了世界广大阶层人民的深切同情与仰慕。最近许多国家内的进步人士和团体，如意大利妇女代表团、法总工会代表团、法名作家阿贡、墨西哥社会领袖曼西西登等，不断涌向苏联访问。要求与苏加强友谊的英国人亦日益增多，根据伦敦“观察所”的民意调查，在伦敦一地，六个人中就有四个人表示亲苏的。同时对美国表示亲善的已由一九四五年的百分之五十八，降至去年的百分之二十一。这反映了苏联影响的扩大和世界人民如何热望着正义与和平。
    继英法国内的大罢工后，过去一周意大利又爆发了一百二十万工人的大罢工运动，以抗议当局反动的经济政策与物价腾贵，其声势之浩大，已引起了反动派的美国主子的恐慌，美驻意大使竟主张在必要时不惜“施用武力对付”；而目前美帝国主义正制造借口，使美占领军能长驻意大利，借以挽救意反动派摇摇欲坠的统治。一周来，英法国内的大罢工风潮，仍在持续中。
    另一方面，延续颇久的英美鲁尔煤产会议，公布了双方所谓协议的公报，华尔街主人表示了骄横的满意；但伦敦则表现了极大的恐慌与震动，金融界与政界人士震慑于“德国钢铁工厂和国际贸易之控制，将逐渐落入美国之手”；舆论也纷纷发出了“不佳的批评”，还说明了由于工党政府幻想美国援助以挽救其经济危机之梦未醒，以及美国趁机所施的压力，虽迫使英国接受了美国的计划，让美国“平分”鲁尔煤矿的管理权，但这种压力下的“协议”，及其所将产生的一连串恶果，将使英美围绕在这一问题上的暗斗，益趋复杂。同时，这一协议也招致了在鲁尔煤矿中握有部分利益的荷、卢等国的抗争，它们纷纷表示反对，并要求参加鲁尔的管制。这里必须指出，英国人民的反美情绪正日益增长中，前引“观察所”民意调查即为一例，英工党进步议员克罗斯曼等及名作家泰勒诸人，近亦竭力抨击美国，斥为“十足的帝国主义国家”“民主的最大敌人”。此外，美国背弃莫斯科会议决定、力谋独占朝鲜的企图，碰到了一个严重的钉子。在苏联政府的严正驳斥和拒绝下，美国擅自召开讨论朝鲜问题的四国会议，已不得不自讨没趣的“宣告延期”。
