　　New Form of Farmer's Power
  　Guanmenkou Establishes Farmers' Committee
    [From our newspaper in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Region, 18th] Guanmenkou Village in Shouzhang County recently established a Farmers' Committee to take overall charge of the entire village's administration. The committee is composed of five farmer representatives and is divided into departments for Director, Citizen Affairs, Social Affairs, Armed Forces, and Distribution. The original various political and civil organizations have all been abolished, and power is concentrated under the leadership of this committee. The establishment of the Farmers' Committee is to establish the absolute power of the farmers. Its formation first underwent a thorough citizen registration process, stipulating that those who oppress people, exploit people, and deliberately antagonize farmers have no citizenship rights, and that only those who are oppressed and exploited are citizens. The farmers' association groups conducted screening from household to household, person by person. During the review of class status, the farmers not only gained a clearer class understanding of the landlords who had already been liquidated, but also identified and liquidated four hidden, unliquidated bankrupt landlords and eleven rich peasants. Having thus drawn clear class boundaries and further clarified the concept of who are enemies and who are friends, the farmers decided to permanently isolate the base landlord class from the farmers' social circle and deny them citizenship rights, expelling two landlords who had infiltrated the regime and one who was working as a primary school teacher. Rich peasants, according to their degree of exploitation, were temporarily granted a probationary period of citizenship ranging from one to seven years, during which time the farmers would exercise control and periodically check their thoughts and actions. After citizen registration, in order to implement the administrative power to control landlords, the farmers felt it necessary to expand the power of the farmers' association, transforming it from a mass organization into a form of political power, so as to fully realize the political aspirations of the farmers, and thus decided to abolish the original various construction organizations and uniformly establish the Farmers' Committee.

　　农民掌权的新形式
  　关门口成立农民委员会
    【本报冀鲁豫十八日电】寿张关门口村，近成立一农民委员会，总揽全村行政。该会系由五个农民代表组成，内分主任及公民、社会、武装、分配等部，原有各种政民机构，均行裁撤，集权于此委员会领导。农民委员会的建立，系为树立农民的绝对权力。其形成先经过一周密的公民登记、规定凡压迫人剥削人蓄意与农民为敌的无公民权，凡受压迫受剥削的人才是公民，由农会小组逐户逐人进行甄别。农民们于复查阶级中，不仅对于原来已被清算地主获得更加明确的阶级认识，对于隐蔽着未被清算的四户破落地主和十一户富农也挑剔出来，而进行清算。如此划清阶级界线，在进一步明确敌我观念时，农民们决定把卑劣的地主阶级永远隔绝于农民社会圈外，不给予公民权利。把二个混进政权、一个当小学教师的地主清洗出去。富农则按照其剥削程度，暂给予一年到七年的公民候补期，在此期间，由农民实行控制，定期检查其思想行动。公民登记之后，农民为贯澈控制地主的行政力量的实施，觉得须扩张农会权力，使之由一群众团体形式变为一政权形式，才能充分实现农民的政治愿望，乃决定废弃原来各种建设组织，统一成立农民委员会。
