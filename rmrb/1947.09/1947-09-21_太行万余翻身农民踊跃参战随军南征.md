    More Than Ten Thousand Emancipated Peasants in Taihang
    Eagerly Enlist and Follow the Army Southward
    [From our correspondent in Taihang, 15th] As General Qin Jiwei's troops of the People's Liberation Army crossed the Yellow River southward, more than ten thousand emancipated peasants in Taihang eagerly joined the army to participate in the war. When the mobilization order for participation reached the villages, cadres and masses were all excited. Many villages quickly convened forums and had enthusiastic discussions. Slogans such as "Go south to dig up the old roots and overthrow the old generals for a great emancipation!" and "Peasants all over the world are one family, helping the peasants in the KMT-controlled areas to achieve great emancipation" inspired the vast numbers of cadres and masses, who eagerly signed up. Deputy Commissioner Liu of the Fourth Special District, Political Work Minister Li Rong of the Third Military Subdistrict Committee, Qinyang County Chief Ren Xiaofeng, and Bo'ai County Chief Li Hanruo personally led the masses to the front lines. More than 110 cadres at the district level and above signed up to participate. The number of masses mobilized reached 10,900. When crossing the Yellow River to the south, everyone said, "In order to overthrow Chiang Kai-shek, we are not afraid of crossing the Yellow River, we are not afraid of the length of time, we will follow the army wherever it goes!"
