　　Licheng County Government Instructs Villages to Take Good Care of Families of Cadres Going South

　　[Report from Licheng] As the Mid-Autumn Festival of Supporting the Army and Cherishing the People approaches, it coincides with the busy production season of rushing to plant wheat and preparing for harvesting. The Licheng County Government has twice instructed all villages to earnestly help the families of military martyrs and cadres in production. The main points are: 1. In order to increase production and survive the famine, mobilize the families of military martyrs and cadres to plant more wheat, and help them plant all the crops before the White Dew solar term through mutual aid, ensuring that the fertilizer application reaches the level of ordinary people. 2. Expand the scope of exchanging labor in mutual aid groups as much as possible, and encourage women, children, and the elderly of military martyrs and cadres to participate in certain production according to their physical strength. 3. Families of cadres going south should be well organized to participate in production such as spinning and weaving to ensure that they do not suffer production losses due to famine, maintain the living standards of ordinary people, and be given comfort. The instructions call on cadres, heroes, models, and activists to take the lead in setting an example and ensuring implementation. (Shuanlong, Yang Ke)
