　　Commemorate September 1st, Implement the Spirit of Serving the People!
　　Today, we journalists in the liberated areas are greeting our own festival with a hundredfold spirit of enterprise. On this day, we should review our own ranks, plan how to improve our business, increase our weapons, so as to more effectively serve the people, serve the patriotic self-defense war, serve the land reform, and defeat the enemy. On this day, we extend our sincere condolences and comradely salute to the news warriors arrested by the dictatorial and traitorous government in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, and to those news colleagues and overseas Chinese reporters who despise the enemy's cruel persecution and always adhere to the cause of national independence, peace, and democracy! For the sake of our country's news undertakings, we journalists in the liberated areas are willing to join hands and encourage each other with advanced news colleagues in the Kuomintang-controlled areas and overseas.
　　As manifested in the field of news, just like in other fields, the liberated areas and the Kuomintang-controlled areas are two completely different worlds. Even under the wartime conditions of the patriotic self-defense war, the news undertakings in the liberated areas are thriving; while the Kuomintang-controlled areas, filled with despicable "muddleheadedness" and inhumanity, the news undertakings are being devastated, withering and declining. The dictatorial traitors fear the people's righteous voice the most. The only things allowed to exist in the Kuomintang-controlled areas are the various government-controlled newspapers of the four major families, the party hacks' news agencies, and fascistized newspapers, and a few self-proclaimed "liberal" ones, such as Ta Kung Pao, which are in essence sycophantic newspapers that make small complaints but sing great praises, and are used as tools to suppress, intimidate, and deceive the broad masses of the people. In our liberated areas, a completely different picture is presented: the people enjoy complete freedom of patriotic speech, private newspapers (there are seven in Harbin alone) are not subject to any restrictions, and have received various assistance from the democratic government. Our news work is developing rapidly, and at the same time, it is gaining the sincere love of the broad masses of the people; this is because it has the following characteristics: a clear people's stand, an extremely responsible attitude of serving the people, and a pragmatic style. Only in this way can our news and communication undertakings become a powerful ideological education and ideological combat weapon in the people's liberation movement. After eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan and two years of patriotic self-defense battles, we have established a complete set of news agencies, communication networks, and newspapers serving the people in the liberated areas, from the broadsheet daily newspapers in various major strategic areas to the new quarto daily newspapers in various sub-districts, county letterpress, lithographic or mimeographed newspapers, village blackboard newspapers, as well as letterpress, mimeographed newspapers or handwritten wall newspapers in troops, institutions, schools, and trade unions; and surrounding and supplying these newspapers is a vast communication network from all aspects, from farms to workshops, from towns to remote areas. On the front lines of the patriotic self-defense war, our reporters are charging into battle alongside the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, and many reporters have already shed blood and sacrificed their lives, becoming our heroes. Our news undertakings have thus gained the heartfelt love and support of the broad masses of the people. Because the Communist Party, the liberated areas, and the People's Liberation Army have become the place where the people of the whole country place their hopes today, our news undertakings in the liberated areas not only reflect and guide the work of the liberated areas, not only conduct a nationwide intense propaganda struggle with the reactionaries, but also occupy a very important position in the national political life, constantly affecting the evolution of the Chinese situation and influencing the trends of world opinion. It can be said that the great achievements of the news undertakings in the liberated areas are the glory and model of the Chinese people's news undertakings.
　　Of course, the achievements of the news undertakings in the liberated areas have not been easily obtained. Every step of it is marked with blood and has undergone arduous struggles. The reason it has such a large scale, pragmatic style, and strong spirit is because it has been fighting under the inspiration and banner of Chairman Mao. The most prominent and concrete manifestation of Mao Zedong Thought in our news undertakings is the spirit of always serving the people. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, all the newspapers of the Kuomintang fled at the first sign of the enemy, and could not exist without relying on the safe cities in the rear; but at this time, our news workers advanced into the occupied areas, penetrated deep behind enemy lines, and published hundreds of daily newspapers in the war environment, where materials were scarce, and under the enemy's cruel "mopping-up" and "suppression" operations, creating and expanding the people's communication network. Our news workers shared life and death with the farmers behind enemy lines, breathing, and fighting together. In this way, we finally learned how to overcome difficulties, how to make the latest propaganda technology take root and grow in the poorest and most backward rural environment. Facts have proved that our news workers were not intimidated by the difficulties at that time, but rather, because they were with the people, they underwent long-term training, and had a clearer position, a richer vitality, and therefore more devoutly dedicated all their energy to the countryside, to the workers and peasants who account for 90% of the total population. This spirit of always serving the people earnestly has given our news undertakings a prospect of infinite vastness and magnificence. In this "September 1st" festival, in order to increase the strength of our news work, we call on reporters and colleagues in the liberated areas, the Kuomintang-controlled areas, and overseas Chinese to study Mao Zedong Thought and strive to become excellent soldiers under the banner of Mao Zedong!
　　Our news workers in the liberated areas have already experienced and are experiencing profound ideological training. From the eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Japanese surrender to the patriotic self-defense war, the national united front has changed from including Chiang Kai-shek to expelling Chiang Kai-shek and striving to end this reactionary rule because American imperialism has replaced Japanese imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek has replaced Wang Jingwei; at the same time, our land policy has also changed from rent reduction and interest reduction to equal distribution of land. Therefore, the situation in the country has changed; because 90% of the peasants are experiencing a great turn-over liberation, complex new problems and a large number of new things have appeared. At this time, our news workers must, in their thinking: First, thoroughly eliminate any idea of peaceful coexistence with the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique; in this great patriotic self-defense war, firmly stand on the side of the people, and dare to sacrifice and shed blood for the sake of burying the people's enemy Chiang Kai-shek; second, resolutely serve the people, the peasants, for the implementation of land reform and the elimination of feudal exploitation, and resolutely fight for the protection of the interests of the peasants. The land reform movement and the patriotic self-defense war are a profound ideological training for our news workers throughout China. We call on every colleague, whether in the liberated areas or the Kuomintang-controlled areas, domestic or overseas Chinese, to deeply examine their own thoughts and positions in the great tide of land reform in the motherland, in the great cause of thoroughly ending Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous rule, so as to further implement the spirit of serving the people.
　　We know that there are still many shortcomings and weaknesses in the work of how news workers in the liberated areas are implementing the work of serving the people. Especially in the process of the land reform movement, our work and even our thinking are still lagging behind reality, such as failing to fully integrate with the masses, and therefore failing to play the due role in reporting on the struggles of the masses. Individual reports are even divorced from or contrary to the facts; there are still many "armchair strategists" in our ranks. This phenomenon deserves our serious vigilance. We must strictly examine our work to see whether it conforms to and implements the mass line. At the same time, we must also overcome the following erroneous biases in our thinking: one is that news undertakings can only be run by relying on a few cadres with high cultural level and good writing skills. The existence of this wrong idea is the reason why the news organizations in some of our regions still retain a fondness for cadres like Ai Qing. This idea will inevitably make it difficult to transform existing news cadres. On the other hand, so-called writing skills are even more divorced from the masses, encouraging new-style imperial examinations, abandoning the basic masses, forming the social basis for the emergence of "armchair strategists" and the "air-raid shelters" for decadent literati of feudal remnants. If this bias is allowed to run rampant, our cause will degenerate and be divorced from the people. Another erroneous bias is that news undertakings may transcend any historical social changes; that is to say, in the land reform movement, it can still use its original, century-old, outdated institutions, styles, and communication methods to work. It must be clear that land reform is changing the entire Chinese society, and our news undertakings must still be thoroughly transformed in the land reform movement, especially our communication work, which must rely on activists among the basic masses who are constantly living with the masses, as the backbone, to massively develop worker-peasant correspondents, making them a grass-roots organization that can speak for the majority of people. The implementation of the spirit of serving the people, as well as the establishment of a worker-peasant communication network composed of grass-roots activists, can guarantee the necessary mass line in the field of news work, and can guarantee that the ideologically transformed news cadres can be supervised by the masses and serve the masses on this basis. This will surely make the news work in our liberated areas take on a new look, not only will it improve the quality of work, but also greatly advance our cause, and greatly advance our cause's connection with the people and service to the people. Contrary to the reactionary Chiang family newspapers, the future of our news undertakings in the liberated areas is infinitely vast and infinitely bright.

　　纪念九一，贯澈为人民服务的精神！
    今天，我们解放区的新闻工作者，正以百倍奋发的精神来迎接本身的节日。在这一天，我们应该检阅本身的队伍，计划如何提高我们的业务，增加我们的武器，以便更有效地服务人民，服务爱国自卫战争，服务土地改革，与战胜敌人。在这一天，我们对蒋区那些被独裁卖国政府拘捕的新闻战士，和那些蔑视敌人惨酷迫害、而始终坚持祖国独立和平民主事业的新闻同仁与侨胞记者，遥致恳切的慰问与战友的敬礼！为着我国人民新闻事业，我们解放区的新闻工作者，愿与蒋区和海外的新闻先进同仁携手并进，共相策励。
    表现在新闻领域方面，犹如表现在其他领域方面一样，解放区与蒋管区是截然不同的两个世界。虽在爱国自卫战争的战时景况下，解放区的新闻事业正在欣欣向荣；而充满卑鄙“颟顸”、人兽系列的蒋管区，新闻事业则正备受摧残，凋零枯萎。独裁卖国贼最惧怕人民的正义呼声，自下蒋管区容许存在的就只有四大家族的各种御用报，党棍的通讯社，与法西斯化的报章，和少数自命为“自由主义”的，如大公报之流，而实质则是小牢骚大捧场的帮闲报纸，并被用来作为镇压恫吓和欺骗广大人民的工具。在我们解放区，则呈现另一种完全不同的图景：人民享有完全的爱国的言论自由，民营报纸（单哈尔滨就有七家）未受任何限制，而且得到了民主政府的种种帮助。我们的新闻工作日趋发展，同时获得广大人民的衷诚爱护；这是因为它具有如下的特点，即：明确的人民的立场、为人民服务的极负责的态度与实事求是的作风。唯其如此，我们的新闻通讯事业成为人民解放运动中一个有力的思想教育与思想战斗的武器。经过八年抗日战争和两年爱国自卫战斗的锻炼，我们解放区已建立起一整套为人民服务的通讯社、通讯网和报纸，由各个大战略区的对开日报起，到各个分区新四开日报、县的铅印、石印或油印报，村的黑板报，以及部队、机关、学校与职工会的铅印、油印报或手抄壁报；而围绕和供应这些报纸的，是广大的由各方面、由农场到作坊、由城镇到穷乡僻壤的通讯网。在爱国自卫战争的火线上，我们的记者正在和解放军的战士一同在冲锋陷阵，而已经有不少记者流血牺牲，成为我们的英雄。我们的新闻事业，就这样得到广大人民的衷心爱护和支持。由于共产党、解放区和人民解放军今天已成为全国人民希望寄托的所在，我们解放区的新闻事业，就不但反映和指导解放区的工作，不但与反动派进行全国性的紧张的宣传斗争，而且已经在全国政治生活中占了十分重要的地位，经常影响着中国时局的演变，影响着世界舆论的动向。可以说，解放区新闻事业的伟大成就，乃是中国人民新闻事业的光荣与模范。
    自然，解放区新闻事业的这种成就，决不是轻易得来的。它的每一步都印着血迹，都经过艰难困苦的奋斗。它之具有如此壮大的规模、求实的作风和坚强的气魄，乃是因为它一直在毛主席的感召与旗帜之下奋斗的。毛泽东思想最突出最具体地反映在我们新闻事业上的，就是始终为人民服务的精神。抗日战争时期，国民党所有的报纸，敌踪未至已望风而逃，非依大后方的安全城市便无法存在；可是我们的新闻工作者，在这时候，却向沦陷区挺进，深入敌后，在战争环境，物资奇缺，以及敌寇残酷“扫荡”、“清剿”的情况下，出版了百数十种日刊，创造了并扩大了人民的通讯网。我们的新闻工作人员与敌后农民同生死共患难，一同呼吸，一同战斗。这样，我们终于学会了如何克服困难，如何将最新式的宣传技术在最穷乏落后的农村环境下生根长大。事实证明，我们的新闻工作者不但没有被当时的困难所吓倒，反而因为它与人民在一起，经受长期的锻炼，而有了更明确的立场，有了更丰富的生命力，并因而更虔诚地捧其全部精力献给农村，献给占全人口百分之九十的工农大众。这种始终认真为人民服务的精神，就使我们的新闻事业面对着一片无限辽阔壮丽的远景。在这“九一”节中，为增加我们新闻工作的力量，我们向解放区、蒋管区、海外侨胞的记者同仁号召，大家都来学习毛泽东思想，努力成为毛泽东旗帜下的优秀战士！
    我们解放区的新闻工作者是已经经历了和正在经历着思想上的深刻锻炼。由八年抗战，日本投降到爱国自卫战争的过程中，民族统一战线已因美帝国主义代替了日本帝国主义，和蒋介石代替了汪精卫，便由包括蒋介石改变为逐出蒋介石，并为结束这反动统治而奋斗；同时我们的土地政策也已由减租减息改变为平分土地。因此，全国的形势变了；由于百分之九十的农民正在经历着大翻身的解放，复杂的新问题与大量的新事物出现了。在这时候我们的新闻工作者，在思想上就必须：第一，彻底肃清任何与蒋介石反动集团和平共处的思想；在这伟大的爱国自卫战争中，坚决站在人民方面，敢于为着葬送人民公敌蒋介石而牺牲、而流血；第二，坚决为人民、为农民，为贯彻土地改革与消灭封建剥削服务，坚决为保护农民的利益而斗争。土地改革运动与爱国自卫战争，对于我们全中国的新闻工作者乃是一个思想上深刻的锻炼。我们号召每一个同仁，无论是解放区的或蒋管区的，国内的或侨胞的，都要在祖国土地改革的大浪潮中，在彻底结束蒋介石卖国统治的大事业中，深刻的检查自己的思想与立场，以便进一步贯彻为人民服务的精神。
    我们知道，解放区内的新闻工作者都在如何贯彻为人民服务的工作中间，还存在着许多的缺点和弱点。特别是在土地改革运动过程中，我们的工作甚至思想还落在现实的后面，如未能完全与群众打成一片，因而未能在报导群众争斗中间发挥应有的作用。个别的报导甚至还与事实脱节或与事实相反；我们的队伍中还存着许许多多“客里空”。这种现象值得我们严重警惕。我们必须严格检查我们的工作，看它是否符合和贯彻群众路线。同时我们在思想上还须克服如下几种错误的偏向：一种是认为新闻事业唯有依靠少数的文化水平高和写作技术好的干部才办得通。这种错误思想的存在，就是我们某些地区的新闻组织对艾柏一流干部尚加留恋的原因。这种想法必然使改造现有新闻干部成为困难。而另一方面，所谓写作技术，就更与群众脱离，鼓励了新式科举，抛弃了基本群众，形成产生“客里空”的社会根据与封建残余堕落文人的“防空洞”。如放任这种偏向，我们的事业就会退化而脱离了人民。另一种错误偏向，则认为新闻事业可能超乎任何历史性的社会变革之外；就是说，在土地改革运动中，它仍然可以运用其原有的、百年不变的、陈旧的机构、作风和通讯方法来工作。必须明白土地改革正在改变着整个中国社会，我们的新闻事业在土地改革运动中仍然必须加以彻底改造，特别是我们的通讯工作，必须依靠基本群众中和群众不断生活在一起的积极分子，以之为骨干，来大规模发展工农通讯员，使之成为能代表大多数人说话的基层组织。为人民服务的精神的贯彻，以及以基层积极分子组成的工农通讯网的建立，才可以保证新闻工作领域内必需的群众路线，才可以保证思想上改造过了的新闻干部在这基础上得到群众的监督而又为群众服务。这样就必定使我们解放区的新闻工作面目一新，不但将提高工作的质量，而且将把我们的事业大大推进一步，将我们的事业与人民的联系和为人民的服务大大推进一步。与反动的蒋家报纸相反，我们解放区的新闻事业的前途是无限远大无限光明的。
