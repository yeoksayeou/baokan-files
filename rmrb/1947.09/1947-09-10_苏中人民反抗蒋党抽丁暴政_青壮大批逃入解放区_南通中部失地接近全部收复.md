Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 7th: Chiang Kai-shek's conscription tyranny in Central China has met with heroic resistance from the people everywhere. According to the Nantong Republican Daily, after Chiang's "General Mobilization Order," the Kuomintang's Sudong Garrison District (i.e., the 49th Division's defense area), only in Nantong, Rugao, Haimen, and Qi'en and other Kuomintang occupied points and lines, planned to conscript 6,180 men. Currently, in the past month, more than 2,000 young and middle-aged people have been seized in Dongtai, Rugao, and Nantong counties. Even the old, weak, and disabled are being seized. A Kuomintang document seized by the People's Liberation Army in the Sanyu battle last month stated: "...Even if someone is lame, as long as they can be cured, they can supplement the shortfall." Under this tyranny, tragedies have occurred repeatedly, and the people have risen up in resistance. In Bihua Township, Nantong, two brothers surnamed Mou were both to be conscripted. Their pleas to the township chief were ineffective, and out of despair over leaving their elderly parents with no one to care for them, the two committed suicide by hanging themselves. Their elderly father, feeling that life was not worth living, chased after the Kuomintang township chief with a kitchen knife, saying, "I want your life." He struck the township chief on the head, killing him, and also slashed the head of the Jia chief. The Kuomintang township chief was forced to hastily announce a postponement of conscription. A certain Bao chief was subjected to a beating by dozens of people who rose up in anger against Kuomintang conscription personnel. Young people in the Kuomintang-occupied areas are now fleeing to the liberated areas. More than 300 people have fled near Huangqiao in Taixing, many of whom have voluntarily joined the people's armed forces to take revenge on Chiang Kai-shek. In a certain district of Taizhou, more than 40 people jointly enlisted in the army, saying, "Rather than being seized by the reactionaries and sent to their deaths, it is better to take up guns and fight." Even those young and middle-aged people who were unfortunately seized and drafted into the Kuomintang army were unwilling to be cannon fodder for traitors. In the battle of Jinjiazhuang in Taixian, more than 100 conscripted new recruits killed their platoon leader and staged a glorious uprising on the battlefield. Three conscripted youths who spent six days in the Kuomintang army organized 32 new recruits from Anhui and fled to the liberated area together. More than 250 able-bodied men in Xinmin Township, Nantong, all fled overnight. Our democratic government has established "Conscription Protection and Escape Reception Centers" in the border areas to support the anti-conscription struggle of young people in the Kuomintang-controlled marginal areas and help them solve their difficulties. In other news, the Kuomintang army in Qingdao has begun implementing a plan to seize 6,000 men. The price of buying a conscript in Qingdao has now risen to between 5 million and 10 million Kuomintang dollars.
Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 7th: In central Nantong, which Chiang Kai-shek designated as a "mopping-up experiment zone," 400,000 patriotic soldiers and civilians have, through nine months of heroic struggle, recovered nine-tenths of all lost territory. Last November, Chiang Kai-shek gathered more than 4,000 troops and established more than 30 strongholds in the area, dividing it into 11 small blocks. Our liberated area was reduced from 32 townships to two townships, and all 42 towns and cities were occupied. However, the people's armed forces persisted in their original self-defense struggle. By February of this year, the military and civilians in the area, in coordination with the Suzhong People's Liberation Army, launched their first counterattack on the Li (Fort) and (Tea) lines, launching extensive attacks and removing most of the Kuomintang strongholds. They also mobilized the masses to conduct land reform re-investigations and carry out the struggle against rent collection and anti-Pa Tian (land that had been taken back by the peasants was seized again by the landlords, locally called "Pa Tian"), recovering lost land in 21 townships. At the same time, they penetrated deep into the Kuomintang-occupied areas, disintegrated a large number of pro-Chiang elements, and the people's confidence in victory was even greater. Beginning in early May, Chiang Kai-shek successively implemented so-called "rigid mopping-up," "five-day encirclement," "key garrison mopping-up," and "repeated sweeps," but was repeatedly crushed. Finally, he adopted the inhumane "bloody mopping-up," which further aroused the people's anger for revenge. A large number of young people poured into the guerrillas and local armed forces, successively capturing key towns such as Qi'an and Jinyu, and recovering lost land in seven more townships, causing the enemy's "bloody mopping-up" to fail again. By this time, a vast area of 14 towns and cities and 30 townships was controlled by the people. In total, in nine months, more than 1,500 Kuomintang troops were annihilated, more than 400 local Chiang Kai-shek elements were disintegrated, and the people's armed forces were six times larger than before.

　　苏中人民反抗蒋党抽丁暴政
  　青壮大批逃入解放区
    南通中部失地接近全部收复
    【新华社陕北七日电】蒋贼在华中的抓丁暴政，已到处遭到人民的英勇反抗。据南通民国日报透露：在蒋贼“总动员令”下后，蒋记苏东师管区（即四十九师防区）仅南通、如皋、海门、启能等蒋占点线，即拟定抽丁六千一百八十名。现东台、如皋、南通三县月来已被抓青壮年达二千名以上。甚至老弱残废也在被抓之列，上月三余战斗中被解放军缴获之蒋方文件称：“……跛脚的只要能医得好，亦可补充不足额。”在此种暴政下，惨案迭出，人民纷起反抗。南通碧华乡某姓兄弟俩将全被抽去，向乡保长哀求无效，以老父母无人养活，悲苦之余，两人同时悬梁自尽。其老父愤不欲生，手提菜刀追扑蒋保长说：“要你抵命，”当头一刀将保长劈死，甲长亦被拦腰砍了一刀。迫得蒋记乡长慌忙宣布延期抽丁。某保曾有数十群众奋起痛打蒋家抽丁人员。蒋占区青年现正纷纷逃来解放区，泰兴黄桥附近已逃出三百余人，其中很多人员自动参加人民武装，向蒋贼复仇，泰州某区即有四十余人联名参军，他们表示：“与其被反动派抓去送死，不如拿起枪来拚。”即不幸被抓而被编入蒋军之青壮年，亦不甘心为卖国贼当炮灰。泰县金家庄战斗中，一百余被抓新兵曾在战场上打死排长举行光荣起义。三个被抓青年在蒋军中待了六天，即组织了三十二个安徽籍新兵一齐逃来解放区。南通新民乡二百五十余壮丁一夜全部逃光。我民主政府已在边区设立“保丁、逃命招待所”，支援蒋管区边缘区青壮年的反抓丁斗争，帮助其解决困难。另讯：青岛蒋军开始实行抓丁六千名之计划，现青市买丁一名市价已涨到需蒋币五百万元至一千万元不等。
    【新华社华中七日电】蒋贼划为“清剿实验区”的南通中部，四十万爱国军民经九个月英勇苦斗，已恢复全部失地十分之九。去年十一月蒋伪曾集结四千余兵力在该地区扎下三十余据点，分割成十一个小块，我解放区由三十二个乡紧缩成两个乡，四十二个市镇全部被占。但人民武装始终坚持原地自卫斗争。至今年二月，该地军民配合苏中解放军首次反击李（堡）与（茶）线，展开广泛出击，将蒋伪据点大部拔除。并发动群众进行土改复查，开展反收租、反扒田（农民收回之田地又被地主夺去，当地叫做“扒田”）斗争，恢复了二十一个乡的失地，同时深入蒋占区，瓦解大批附蒋分子，群众胜利信心更高。五月初起、蒋伪先后实行所谓“硬性清剿”、“五天会剿”、“重点驻剿”、“反复扫荡”，又连遭粉碎，最后乃采取灭绝人性之“血洗清剿”，但更激起人民复仇怒火，大批青年涌入游击队与地方武装，连克骑岸、金余等重镇，又恢复七个乡的失地，使敌之“血洗清剿”又告破产。至此，十四个市镇与三十个乡的广大地区控制在人民手中，总计九个月中共歼蒋伪一千五百余，瓦解土蒋四百余，人民武装则较前扩大六倍。
