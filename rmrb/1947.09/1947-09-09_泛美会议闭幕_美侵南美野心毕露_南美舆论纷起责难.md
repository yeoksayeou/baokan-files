　　Pan-American Conference Concludes
　　U.S. Ambitions to Invade South America Fully Exposed
　　South American Public Opinion Rises Up in Condemnation
　　[Comprehensive Xinhua News Agency dispatches] The Pan-American Conference, which began in Brazil on August 15th, concluded on the 2nd after the signing of the so-called "Rio de Janeiro Treaty." According to Agence France-Presse, the closing occurred amidst an atmosphere of "weariness" among the delegates. The main content of the treaty, ostensibly for the signatory nations to use military force to "jointly defend against aggression from the North Pole to the South Pole" (note: British Canada, Danish Greenland, etc., are also included in the so-called "American security zone"), is in reality the first loss of national sovereignty for South American countries. Although the conference was largely controlled by the United States, the "lingering echoes" of South American countries' dissatisfaction with the United States could still be heard. The most obvious of these were the proposals by Cuba and other countries to add clauses on economic cooperation and mutual assistance and the prohibition of economic aggression to the treaty, and the proposal by Argentina that defensive actions require the consent of all countries. After the above two proposals gained the support of Chile and other countries, U.S. Secretary of State Marshall was quite uneasy. On the 19th, after meeting with the Chilean Foreign Minister, Marshall went alone to the residence of the Argentine Foreign Minister, knocked on the door, and offered himself for a conversation that lasted one hour. Subsequently, the two proposals were rejected on August 22nd and 25th. Regarding the former, the United States arrogantly notified the conference that "economic issues should be left for discussion in Bogota (the capital of Colombia) next January." Regarding the latter, Marshall proposed a "compromise" on the issue of voting procedures, namely that collective action would be binding after being approved by a two-thirds majority, but countries that did not agree would not be forced to supply troops. This cunning suggestion would in fact still allow the United States to overstep its authority and take over the internal and foreign affairs of other countries.
　　The United States' policy towards the Pan-American Conference has aroused strong opposition from public opinion in various American countries. According to a dispatch from Rio de Janeiro: the newspaper "大众论坛" (Dàzhòng Lùntán - "People's Tribune") published an interview with Prestes (note: Prestes is the General Secretary of the Brazilian Communist Party, who enjoys high prestige among the Brazilian people and is known as the "Hero of Hope") in which he commented: Only the unity of the major powers can bring peace. "The so-called continental bloc not only cannot guarantee peace, but can also harm peaceful cooperation between countries. Promoting Pan-Americanism, which calls for cooperation between exploiters and the exploited, is merely a mask to conceal the aggression of American imperialism against oppressed Latin America." The Cuban newspaper "呼声报" (Hūshēng Bào - "Voice") declared: This conference "threatens the sovereignty of Latin American countries. On the one hand, the United States demands that South American countries contribute to the war effort, while on the other hand, it restricts the import of goods from these countries, such as sugar from Cuba, coffee from Central America, and minerals from South America." The newspaper continued: "What Latin America needs are machines and merchant ships to implement industrialization and develop agriculture, but the United States only provides them with weapons." Many newspapers in Mexico condemned the country's reactionaries for supporting the militarization of Latin America, and the Chilean conservative group also issued a declaration opposing overly close relations with the United States, which would harm their interests. The Argentine government's semi-official newspaper "克利提加" (Kèlìtíjiā - "Crítica") severely condemned the United States' "continental bloc" policy, calling it "damaging to national sovereignty and weakening the United Nations." The article also stated that the American representatives were "greatly alarmed" by this criticism. The Canadian newspaper "大众论坛" (Dàzhòng Lùntán - "People's Tribune") pointed out: The American countries are now impoverished, and instead of providing economic assistance, the United States wants them to "strengthen their armaments." Brazilian newspapers sharply criticized the United States' so-called "military aggression threat" clamor. "奥希报" (Àoxī Bào - "Oxi") stated: "The purpose of this clamor is 'to consolidate the rule of American trusts.'" The newspaper pointed out: The attack of Wall Street tycoons on the Western Hemisphere is encountering growing resistance.

### 泛美会议闭幕　美侵南美野心毕露　南美舆论纷起责难

　　泛美会议闭幕
  　美侵南美野心毕露
  　南美舆论纷起责难
    【综合新华社电讯】八月十五日起在巴西举行之泛美会议于二日签订所谓“里约热内卢条约”后，据法新闻社讯，已于各代表深感“厌倦”气氛中闭幕。该约主要内容表面上为缔约国以武力“共同防御自北极至南极”（按英国之加拿大，丹麦之格陵兰等地亦被列入所谓“美洲安全区”内）所受之“侵略”，实际则系南美各国国家主权之首次丧失。会议虽在美国多方把持下，但南美各国对美国不满之“余音”，仍充耳可闻。其中最明显的，即古巴等国所提在条约中加入经济合作互助及禁止经济侵略条款一案和阿根廷所提采取防御行动须经全体国家同意一案。以上两案于获得智利等国之支持后，美国务卿马歇尔曾颇为不安。马氏十九日在会见智利外长后，又独自赴阿根廷外长住所，敲门自荐，谈话一小时。以后两案于八月廿二、二十五两日竟先后遭否决。关于前者美国专横地通知大会，“经济问题应留待明年一月在波哥大（哥伦比亚首都）讨论。”关于后者，表决程序问题，马歇尔则提出“折衷”办法，即集体行动经三分之二多数同意后即具有约束力，但对未同意国家不强求其供应军队。这一狡猾建议实际上将仍是美国越俎代庖，包办其他国家的内政外交。
    美国对泛美会议的政策，引起美洲各国舆论的强烈反对。据里约热内卢讯：“大众论坛”报发表普列特（按：普氏为巴西共党总书记，在巴西人民中威信极高，誉为“希望的英雄”）对记者的谈话，评称：只有各大国的一致，才有和平。“所谓大陆集团，不但不能保障和平，反足损害各国间之和平合作。宣扬剥削者与被剥削者合作的泛美主义，只是掩饰美帝国主义向被压迫的拉丁美洲进攻的假面具而已。”古巴呼声报宣称：这一会议“威胁了拉丁美洲各国的主权。美国一方面要求南美各国对战争有所贡献，他方面则限制各国物产的入口，如古巴的糖、中美的咖啡和南美的矿产。”该报继称：“拉丁美洲需要的是机器及商船，以便实行工业化和发展农业，但美国却只供给他们以武器。”墨西哥很多报纸谴责该国反动派支持拉丁美洲的军事化，而智利的保守分子集团亦发表宣言，反对和美国关系过密，以致损害他们的利益。阿根廷政府半官方机关报“克利提加”报严厉谴责美国的“大陆集团”政策，称之为“损害国家主权，并削弱联合国机构。”该文并称：美国代表对于这一批评“大为惊恐”。加拿大“大众论坛”报指出：美洲各国现已一贫如洗，美国不但不予经济援助，反要各国“加强军备”。巴西报纸尖锐抨击美国所谓“军事侵略威胁”的叫嚣。奥希报称：“这种叫嚣的目的‘乃在于巩固美国托辣斯的统治’”。该报指出：美华尔街大亨对西半球的进攻，正遇到增长的抵抗。
