    People's Performing Arts Troupe Carries Out Three Checks
    Squeezing Out Hidden Traitorous Landlords and Local Tyrants
    [This Dispatch] The People's Performing Arts Troupe, during its land reform study, purged Shen Qingjiang, a traitorous landlord and local tyrant. Shen Qingjiang is from Ziluocun village in Wu'an. His family was of the declining landlord class (due to his father's opium addiction and squandering). However, he still possessed more than 50 mu of land, six mu of garden, and more than 30 rooms of houses. Many of his relatives were big landlords, traitors and local bullies. He grew up in his maternal uncle's house (his uncle was a major local tyrant in Shahe), and was influenced by the landlord family, bullying poor people, and becoming a hooligan. After the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, under the instructions of his uncle, he participated in organizing the landlord armed forces, and later served as a puppet Baochang for two years, forcing the people to build seven bunkers and dig blockade trenches for the enemy. In 1943, he joined the puppet East Asia Allied Autonomous Army as a tax accountant and collector, a probationary second lieutenant staff member in the Propaganda Section, a lieutenant platoon leader in the Model Company, and a captain adjutant, participating in six enemy mopping-up operations. In the months before Japan's surrender, he infiltrated our ranks, using his revolutionary position to put on a military uniform and return to the village, demanding that the village cadres release his uncle and the secret agent and local tyrant uncle-in-law who attempted to shoot our district cadres. His family, under the guise of being military dependents, was not only not liquidated by the masses, but also received the fruits of the struggle. After joining the performing arts troupe, he served as a civil affairs cadre, and once wrote a letter home feigning progress to avoid a more serious struggle, and threatened the village cadres with his important position. This "Three Checks" movement revealed that he was a traitor hidden in the revolutionary ranks, waving the banner of revolution to maintain his landlord interests. Under the righteous indignation of all comrades, he was purged, and his crimes will be dealt with by the masses of his village.

    人民文工团三查开展
    挤出暗藏奸霸地主
    【本报讯】人民文艺工作团在进行土改学习中，清除出奸霸地主——申清江。申清江是武安紫罗村人，家系破落地主（因其父抽白面败坏的）。但至今还留有五十多亩地，六亩园子，房子三十多间。他的亲戚多是大地主兼汉奸恶霸，他自小是在他舅家长大的（舅父是沙河大恶霸），受地主家庭的熏陶，欺侮穷人，流氓成性。抗战爆发后，受其舅父指示，参加组织地主武装，后又当了两年伪保长，曾强迫老百姓替敌人修碉堡七座与挖封锁沟。四三年又参加伪东亚同盟自治军做税务会计兼征收员、宣传处准尉科员、模范连中尉排长、上尉副官等职，参加过敌人的六次扫荡。在日本投降前几个月他混进了我们的队伍，借着革命的职位穿上军服回到村里，要求村干部释放其舅父及企图枪杀我区干部的特务恶霸姨丈。他的家庭以军属名义不但没有被群众清算，还分得了斗争果实。到文工团后，曾担任民运干事，曾假意写信回家，表示自己进步，以逃避更严重之斗争，并以自己负重要职务来威胁村干部。此次三查运动查出，原是一个隐藏在革命队伍中，打着革命的旗帜以维护其地主利益的奸霸。在全体同志正义的激愤下，将他清洗，他的罪恶将由其本村群众去处理。
