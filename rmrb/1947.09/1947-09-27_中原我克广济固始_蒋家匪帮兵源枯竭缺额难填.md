Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains Front, 23rd (Delayed Dispatch): A unit of the People's Liberation Army under Liu and Deng captured Guangji County in eastern Hubei on the 14th. The defending enemy fled in panic. The results of the battle are pending investigation.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains Front, 25th: A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army recaptured Gushi County seat in one fell swoop on the night of the 22nd, wiping out a part of the Chiang bandit troops, capturing more than 40 prisoners, seizing more than 100 long and short guns, 1,000 mountain gun shells, 30,000 rounds of ammunition, and more than 100 *shi* of grain. This city was first captured by us on August 24th and was subsequently voluntarily evacuated.

　　Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 25th: Documents seized from the Chiang side in Shatuji prove that Chiang's bandit troops are running out of soldiers and it is difficult to fill vacancies. Zheng Zhangjun, the first section chief of the military affairs department of the 57th Division, in an early April memo to his division commander and deputy division commander, stated that the 60th Brigade (i.e., the 4th Provisional Brigade) was short 1,376 men, the 117th Brigade was short 2,007 men, and the directly subordinate units were short 400 men, for a total shortage of 3,783 men. However, Chiang's "Army Headquarters" only allowed 1,500 men to be replenished. As a result, the division formed the so-called "Henan-Anhui Recruitment Corps" in early May, led by Wang Huazhong, to forcibly conscript soldiers everywhere. However, reports of "difficult recruitment" came like snowflakes from various counties. For example, in a late May telegram from Wang Huazhong to Duan Linmao, it was stated: "Recruitment in Yongcheng and Xia邑 Counties is very difficult because the urban suburbs and rural areas are occupied by treacherous bandits (note: falsely referring to the Liberation Army)." Furthermore, in a June 16th memo from the division's military affairs department to the division commander and deputy division commander, it was stated: "Wang Huimin's 'recruitment' detachment has only 'recruited' five men as of the end of May." Even if some were fortunate enough to be captured, escorting and guarding them was a major problem. For example, Wang, the regimental commander of the division's special service regiment, reported that Yin Hanqing, the director of the "recruitment" office in Hao County, reported that Hao County had "recruited" more than 100 new soldiers, but due to the weak military strength and the unrest in the county, it was difficult to escort them. Furthermore, Wang Huazhong stated in a June 26th telegram to Duan Linmao: "The 'recruited' new soldiers are very unstable, and it is difficult to command them. The cadres are unwilling to go." He continued: "Platoon Leader Li cannot command the soldiers and is only left with twelve men. The rest have all fled."

    中原我克广济固始
    蒋家匪帮兵源枯竭缺额难填
    【新华社中原前线二十三日电】（迟到）刘邓所部人民解放军一部，十四日攻克鄂东之广济县城，守敌闻风逃窜，战果待查。
    【新华社中原前线二十五日电】人民解放军某部，于二十二日夜一举再克固始县城，歼蒋匪一部，俘四十余名，缴长短枪百余枝，山炮弹一千发，子弹三万发，粮食百余石。按该城于上月二十四日为我首次攻克，其后曾主动撤出。
    【新华社华东前线二十五日电】沙土集缴获蒋方文件中证明蒋贼兵源枯竭，缺额难填，五七师军务处第一课课长郑章俊，于四月初给其正副师长的签呈，统计该师六十旅（即预四旅）缺额为一千三百七十六名，一一七旅缺额为二千零七名，直属队缺额为四百名，共缺三千七百八十三名。而蒋贼“陆军总部”仅允补充一千五百名。于是该师乃于五月初旬由王化中负责组成所谓“豫皖招募总队”四出抓丁。但结果是各县“招募困难”的报告，如雪片飞来。例如五月下旬王化中给段霖茂的电文中称：“永城、夏邑二县配募，区城郊与乡间均有奸匪（按：诬指解放军）盘据，招募十分困难。”又该师军务处六月十六日给正副师长的签呈中称：“王惠民‘招募’大队截至五月底止仅‘募’到五名。”即使能侥幸抓到一些，押送、看管又大成问题。如该师特务团团长王某呈报毫县“招募”处处长尹汉卿回报称：毫县新兵已“募”百余，但因兵力薄弱，县境不宁，实难押送。又王化中六月二十六日给段霖茂电称：“所‘募’新兵甚不巩固，统率困难，干部都不愿前去。”继称：“李排长不能统率士兵，仅剩下十二名，余均潜逃。”
