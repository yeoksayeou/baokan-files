　　Xiyang Overcomes Complacency
  　Diversified Wheat Planting Starts Early
  　Manure Accumulation and Crop Rotation Intensified
    [Report from our newspaper in Xiyang] After the County Party Committee issued a call to vigorously plant wheat, the masses in various places responded enthusiastically. During the discussion of wheat planting in Dongguan, two thoughts were discovered: (1) Zhao Lianhe said, "I do want to plant, but planting too little won't do much good. If I plant more, I'm afraid I'll have a hard time!" (2) Wang Youwei said, "Wheat must be planted by the Autumn Equinox to catch up with the next crop, but if we cut the green crops, wouldn't that be a waste!" Most of the masses were complacent and also found it troublesome. Then, Li Yu'ao said, "That year, I planted three mu of wheat during the Cold Dew period. Everyone said it wouldn't take! But it yielded one stone and six dou, and I even squeezed in a crop of millet, yielding two bags." Li Jinhu said, "People are made of iron, and food is steel. Without manure, the land won't yield grain. As long as we can apply more manure, it's not too late to plant during the Cold Dew period." Zhao Yongqing said, "Two seasons are always better than one. Planting wheat on the sunny slopes is successful nine out of ten years." Finally, everyone proposed to calculate the family's resources. The entire street has 1,500 mu of land. Assuming a 30% yield, it can produce 450 stone of grain, averaging four dou per person, enough to get through the winter. At this point, everyone unanimously recognized that early wheat planting could provide food sooner, and they actively formulated plans. The street leader's family plans to plant 1.5 mu per person. Military dependent Miao Shutian's mother will exchange a dou of millet she saved for wheat seeds. The entire street, with twelve groups and 489 people, will plant 172 mu of wheat, averaging 0.35 mu per person (due to the limited land in the urban area), and has prepared 15 stone of wheat seeds, needing only three more stone to be enough. Each mu has accumulated 30 dan of fertilizer. Li Yu'ao's group has already organized labor and livestock to deliver manure to the wheat fields for three days. Under the call of the new hero Tian Chouren in Dongfengren, it was proposed to plant one mu of wheat per person. The cooperative is responsible for adjusting wheat seeds. The entire village has now reclaimed 96 mu of wasteland and has 116 mu of large, astringent wheat land, which has been plowed twice and plans to be plowed twice more. It is also planned to plant 142 mu of wheat to catch up with the next crop, achieving one mu of wheat per person. Guo Wu Brigade in Beitou Village has prepared 11.5 mu of wheat land and reclaimed 15.5 mu of wasteland. Xizhuang has prepared 45 mu of land, and Puzhou has also prepared 121 mu, accumulating 2,253 dan of fertilizer. Qianzhuang has also accumulated 2,361 dan of fertilizer, enough to fertilize 120 mu of wheat land. Wheat planting campaigns have been launched in various places. (Ziyou, Xin Ying)

　　昔阳打破麻痹
  　多种麦早接嘴
  　纷纷积肥改茬
    【本报昔阳讯】县委发出大力种麦的号召后，各地群众纷纷响应。东关在讨论种麦中，发现两种思想：（一）赵连和说：“我倒想种，可是种的少了不顶事，多种点吧，又怕喝了苦水”！（二）王有为说：“秋分麦入土，要想赶茬，就得把青庄稼割了，那不毁啦”！大部群众都很麻痹，又嫌麻烦。接着李玉鳌说：“我那年寒露种了三亩麦，都说不沾啦！结果打下一石六斗，还赶了一季黍，打上两口袋”。李金虎说：“人是铁头饭是钢，上不上粪土打不下粮。只要能多上粪，赶寒露种上也不迟”。赵永庆说：“两季总比一季强，阳坡点麦，十年九得。”最后大家提出算家当，全街一千五百亩地，按三成年景计算，能打四百五十石粮，每口人平均四斗，顶好的能吃过冬。这时大家才一致认识早种麦来年能早接嘴，纷纷订出计划。街长家每口人要种亩半，军属苗树田妈，把节约下的一斗黄米换成麦种。全街十二个组，四百八十九口人，种麦一百七十二亩，每人平均三分半（因城关地少），准备麦种十五石，再有三石就够种了；每亩积肥已达三十担，李玉鳌组已组织劳畜力送麦地粪三天。东丰稔在新英雄田丑仁的号召下，提出每口人种麦一亩，合作社负责调剂麦种，现全村开熟荒九十六亩，有大涩麦地一百一十六亩，已普翻两次，准备还翻两次，并计划再种赶茬麦一百四十二亩，达到每口人一亩麦。北头村郭五大队，已准备麦地十一亩半，开荒十五亩半。西庄准备了四十五亩地，铺沟也准备了一百二十一亩，并积肥二千二百五十三担，前庄也积下二千三百六十一担肥，能上麦地一百二十亩。各地均开展了种麦运动。（子由、新颖）
