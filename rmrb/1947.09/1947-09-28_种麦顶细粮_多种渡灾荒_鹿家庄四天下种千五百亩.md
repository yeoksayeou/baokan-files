    Plant Wheat, The Best Grain
    Plant More to Overcome Famine
    Luciazhuang Plants 1,500 Mu in Four Days
    [This newspaper, Changzhi News] After settling accounts, Luciazhuang got through to the masses, everyone wants to increase their wheat fields. At a meeting on the 7th of this month, Li Zhaocai said, "Our village suffered a hailstorm and only harvested 30-40% of the autumn crops. After being swept by a strong wind, it looks like famine is right in front of us. Planting wheat is like planting the best grain. In '43, planting more wheat saved people from the famine; it was a major thing." Everyone enthusiastically discussed planting more wheat. Cui Hutou said, "I only plant three mu of wheat every year. This year I'll plant ten mu of good quality wheat." Qin Tongcheng said, "This year I have the land; my team will also convert twenty mu of valley land to wheat." Ping Panghai said, "I benefited from planting wheat last year; everyone should plant more. What the government says is never wrong." Cui Huhai said, "There are advantages to planting wheat during the White Dew season. Early planting allows for more seedlings and a bigger harvest. Planting wheat before the White Dew allows roots to grow deep underground, and the seedlings emerge early and are resistant to winter frost." After mobilization, the whole village organized to rush the planting of wheat. One team was more motivated than the other, completing the planting of over 1,500 mu in four days.

    种麦顶细粮
    多种渡灾荒
    鹿家庄四天下种千五百亩
    【本报长治讯】鹿家庄从算帐打通了群众思想，都要增加麦田。本月七号开大会，李招财说：“咱村受冰雹灾只收三四成秋，又经过刮了一场大风，看灾荒就在眼前摆着，种麦顶细粮，四三年就是多种麦渡灾荒救活人顶了大事”。大家热烈讨论多种麦，崔虎头说：“我每年只种三亩麦子，今年种十亩好壕麦”。秦同成说：“今年有垧，我组谷地也要改上二十亩麦子”。平胖孩说：“我去年种麦沾了光，大家多种吧，政府说话没有差”。崔虎孩说：“白露种麦有好处，早种发苗能多收，白露以前种上麦，在地下扎的根深，上来早冬天又耐冻。”经动员后全村组织起来突击种麦，一组比一组劲头大，四天种完一千五百余亩。
