    Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 21st -- The Northern Jiangsu People's Liberation Army held a victory celebration rally with over 20,000 soldiers and civilians in a certain area behind enemy lines on the 6th of this month. At the rally, Political Commissar Cao announced on the spot the news of the victorious southward advance of the Liu-Deng and Chen-Xie armies, and the commencement of a nationwide counter-offensive. He forcefully pointed out: "The current issue in Northern Jiangsu is no longer just how to persevere, but to prepare to recover lost territories and expand the liberated areas." He called upon the entire army to guard against arrogance and impetuosity, further improve combat techniques, win more major victories like the Ye Ting City battle, eliminate the KMT bandits in Northern Jiangsu, and advance towards the KMT-controlled areas! The participating soldiers and civilians, stirred by the call for a major counter-offensive, immediately responded with thunderous applause and cheers. The venue of the victory celebration was magnificently and solemnly decorated. Various light and heavy weapons seized from the KMT bandits were densely lined up. The PLA soldiers were in high spirits, and the men and women of the masses were all dressed in new clothes, beaming with joy. More than 200 combat heroes at all levels were commended. The Baozi Brigade, which won the title of "Ye Ting Unit," and seven special-class heroes were personally awarded by Commander Chen amidst military music. The rally concluded with a cavalry performance of bayonet drills, rescue operations, and horseback tactics. In the evening, five stages simultaneously presented a grand performance to celebrate.

    Also, Northern Jiangsu People's Liberation Army Commander General Chen Qingxian, at a cadre meeting on the 14th, called on the entire army to welcome the major counter-offensive. He pointed out that the Northern Jiangsu People's Liberation Army had established many merits in persisting in the patriotic and self-defense struggle behind enemy lines. In the future, it should continue its efforts, improve its thinking, strengthen political work, eliminate guerrilla habits, build a stronger and more regular people's army, continue to work hard to restore the lost territories of Northern Jiangsu, and cooperate with the Chen-Su (粟) army of East China in a major counter-offensive. All the cadres attending the meeting were in high spirits.
