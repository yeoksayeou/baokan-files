A Record of Qinshui Civilians Accompanying the Army on the Southern Expedition

The glorious people of Qinshui have created earth-shattering glorious deeds more than once. As early as five years ago, they created the famous "Siege of Qinshui City" war. This time, accompanying the army on the southern expedition, they completed another glorious mission.

They are sufficient to represent the high level of awareness and strong will of the people in the liberated areas. No matter how many difficulties there were along the way, they were all solved by them one by one, and the task was successfully completed.

On the day before departure, the original plan was for a five-day mission. Later, because the army was about to cross the Yellow River to the south, they did not hesitate at all because they had not made long-term preparations, nor because they were far away from their hometown. They resolutely took on the task of carrying shells and bullets to accompany the army southward, discussing along the way: "This is glorious, this is glorious!"

Yes, because no long-term preparations had been made, difficulties were encountered from the beginning. Xin Zhuang's Duan Qishun's shoes were so tattered that he could not walk, and he had already worn a piece of his heel off. During the day, the captain said, "Go back!" Others also said, "Qishun, your shoes are no good, and your feet are hurt. Go back!" However, Duan Qishun got angry. He firmly said, "No, we must complete the task. The people of Qinshui are not afraid of hardship." There were many people like this, and they all stuck to their posts.

When crossing the Yellow River near Shaoyuan, the river was flooding, and the water was rapid and large. The team had already gone ahead for a long time, and there could be no more delay. Everyone jumped into the river. Yang Kuisheng and another person carried eight shells and could not stand firm. They were knocked down by the flood along with the shells. At this time, a man named Yang Hai quickly jumped into the water and rescued both of them, but the shells had already sunk to the bottom of the river. It was also dark. At this time, their captain said: "The people have been rescued, forget about the shells," and found a village to stay in. But Yang Hai thought in his heart: "These eight shells are to be carried to the front line to fight Chiang Kai-shek, how can they be lost like this? They must be sent to the front!"

The next morning, Yang Hai quietly went down to the river to feel for the shells. The water was still so rapid and so deep, but Yang Hai jumped in alone and finally felt out the shells one by one. In the end, he even felt out his shoes and dry food bag. When others went to look for him, Yang Hai was carefully wiping the shells dry!

When crossing the Yellow River, it was raining, and the thirty-mile road soaked everyone like drowned chickens, but they did not show any signs of retreating. Everyone safely reached the river bank and crossed over boat by boat.

It was when the Fifth Detachment was crossing the river that one of the boats suddenly hit a reef. The bottom of the boat hit a bowl-sized hole, and Yellow River water poured into the boat. At this time, even the boatmen, who had been through many storms, became anxious. Seeing that more and more water was coming in, the boat was gradually sinking. But someone had a flash of inspiration and shouted, "Take off your clothes and stuff them in!" At this time, everyone rushed to take off their clothes and stuffed the hole. The ammunition and people safely crossed to the other side of the Yellow River.

After landing on the south bank, two things happened: one was that American bombers often strafed or dropped bombs overhead, but the civilians were not intimidated. On the contrary, they became more courageous, and had to travel fifty li every day to catch up with the team.

The other thing was: Chiang Kai-shek's vicious propaganda. They said that the Communist Party wanted to kill, set fire, and practice communism of wives, especially that all the old people over fifty years old would be killed. The purpose was to deceive everyone and create a no-man's land. Some people here knew about the People's Army, and still stayed. Those who didn't know saw the actual actions of our army and civilians and woke up as if from a big dream. They said: "Damn them, still playing tricks even when they are about to die..."

There is a story about the Third Detachment. This is what happened to them in Shimen Gully. They walked into a courtyard, and the door was tightly locked. Later, they found three old people in the straw shed, an old couple and a pregnant daughter-in-law. When they saw the civilians, they trembled all over. The comrade in charge of the Third Detachment quickly explained to them in person. At first, they didn't listen, but later, seeing that these people were so kind and peaceful, for example, if they borrowed a bowl, they would definitely wash it clean before returning it. Although there were big pears on the pear tree in the yard, no one picked one. They also helped feed the cattle. Especially after they settled down, they found that the woman was about to give birth, and it was inconvenient for her family of three to live in one room, so they quickly vacated a room. As it happened, the baby was born right after moving in. Therefore, the whole family gratefully said: "This is really an army of the people. If it were the Central Army, let alone vacating a room, who knows what would have happened!"

Along the way, the suffering people told us their innermost thoughts, and bitterly accused the landlords of their crimes. An old hired worker in Liang Village said that his son had worked for others as a clerk for more than ten years, and later was conscripted by the landlord as a soldier. He didn't dare to ask for him back, and only asked the landlord to calculate a few years of wages, but was scolded by the landlord. He said: "Now that our team has come, we must take revenge!" Another poor intellectual wrote a poem. The first two lines said: "People meet, crying and laughing!" It truly describes the scene at that time.

Another family of five only ate a handful of wheat for a meal, mixed with bitter vegetables for soup. Their clothes couldn't cover their bodies, exposing their flesh, and they looked sad all day long. When the Qinshui civilians were about to return, an old man cried sadly and said: "The People's Army is so good, they still let you go back. My son was drafted into the Central Army thirty-one years ago, and has not returned to this day!" After he finished speaking, tears welled up in his eyes. They bid farewell to that fellow villager with tears in their eyes. Before that, they had sent the ammunition to the front line, and the next day they captured Xin'an City.

    沁源民夫随军南征记
    光荣的沁源人民，曾不止一次的创造了惊天动地的光荣事迹。远在前五年，便创造了著名的“围困沁源城”的战争，此次随军南征，又完成了一次光荣的任务。
    他们是足够代表解放区人民的高度的觉悟与坚强的意志的，无论沿途有多少困难。都被他们一一解决了、胜利的完成了任务。
    在出发前一天，原来计划五天的任务，后来因为大军要渡河南下，他们并不因为没有作长期的准备，并不因为远离家乡，而有半点犹豫，坚决的担起炮弹、子弹随上大军南下，一路上议论着：“这是光荣的，这是光荣的！”
    是的，因为没有作长期准备，一开始就碰上了困难，辛庄段启顺的鞋实在破烂的不能走了，已经把脚后跟磨烂了一块。白天队长说：“你回去吧！”其他人也说：“启顺，你的鞋不行了，脚也打坏了，回吧！”可是，段启顺生气了，他坚决的说：“不，一定要完成任务，沁源人就不怕吃苦”，象这样的人很多，他们都坚持着自己的岗位。
    在邵源附近渡黄河时，河正下来了，水又急又大，队伍已经在前方走了好久了，不能再耽误了，大家跳下河去。杨魁生两人担了八颗炮弹，站不住脚，连人带炮弹被大水冲倒了，这时，就有个叫杨孩的赶忙跳下水去，把两个人都捞了起来，可是炮弹已经沉到河底了，天也黑了，这时，他们的大队长说：人救起来了，炮弹算了，就找个村住下了。可是杨孩心里想：“这八颗炮弹，是要担到前线去打蒋介石的，怎么能这样丢了呢？一定要送到前方去！”
    第二天大早，杨孩一个人悄悄的下河去摸炮弹了，水仍是那样的急，而又那样的深，但杨孩一个人跳进去，终于把炮弹一颗一颗的摸了出来，最后连鞋子干粮袋也摸了出来，等别人去找他时，杨孩正在小心的擦干炮弹哩！
    将过黄河的时候，天下着雨，卅里地路上把每个人淋的象落汤水鸡，但他们并不表示退缩，大家都安然的到了河岸，一船一船的渡过去。
    就是五中队过河时，有一只船忽然碰到了礁石上，船底碰了碗大的窟窿，黄水往船里冒进来，这时，连久经风浪的船夫也着急起来，眼看水越进越多，船渐渐往下沉了，可是有人急中生智的叫喊着“脱下衣服塞”，这时大家都抢着脱衣服，把窟窿塞住了，弹药和人都安全的渡到黄河对岸。
    上了南岸就遇上两件事情：一件是美式轰炸机经常在头顶扫射或丢炸弹，但是，民夫们没有被吓退，相反更英勇了，每天起马得赶五十里地，要追上队伍。
    另一件事情是：蒋介石的恶毒宣传，他们说共产党要杀人放火，共产共妻，尤其是说要把五十岁以上的老人都要杀完，其目的是要把所有的人都欺骗走，造成无人区，这里有些人是知道人民军队的情形的，仍旧留下了，不知道的人，看见了我们军民的实际行动就好象从大梦中醒过来样的回来了。他们说：“狗日的们，临死还捣个鬼………。”
    这里三中队有件事，这是他们在石门沟所发生的。他们走进一个院子，门紧锁着，后来在草房里找出三个老百姓来，老两口和一个怀孕的媳妇，他们见了民夫们，浑身抖擞着，三中队的负责同志连忙亲自给他解释，起初他们不听，后来见到这些人和和气气的，比如借了碗一定洗净才还，院里梨树上虽然结了大梨子，可是没有一个人去摘一颗，又帮助喂牛，尤其是在住下后，发现人家的媳妇快生孩子了，他家三口人住一个房不方便，赶快腾了一间出来，恰巧住进去就生下孩子了。因此全家感激的说：“真是老百姓的队伍，要是中央军，别说腾房，不知出什么事情呢！”
    沿路上苦人们向我们诉说心底话，痛诉地主的罪恶，梁村有个老雇工诉说他儿子给人家当了十多年伙计，后来又替地主当壮丁抽走了，他也不敢要人，只向地主算几年工钱，还被地主骂了一顿。他说：“这次咱们队伍来了，可要报报仇呢！”另一个穷知识分子作了一首诗。第一二两句说：“百姓相见，哭笑相连！”确实描写了当时的情景呵。
    另有一家老百姓五口人，一顿饭只吃升把麦子，拌苦苦菜作汤，衣服盖不住，露出肉来，整天哭丧着脸，当沁源民夫要往回返时，有一位老百姓伤心的哭着说：“人民军队就是好，还叫你们回，我儿三十一年给中央军支差走了，到现在也没回来！”他说完泪水已夺眶而出了，他们忍泪与那个老乡告别了，在这以前他们把弹药送到了前线上，第二天就打下了新安城。（太岳新华社电）
