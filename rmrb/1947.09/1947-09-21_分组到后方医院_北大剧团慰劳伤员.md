    Grouped to Rear Hospitals
    Peking University Drama Troupe Comforts the Wounded
    [This Dispatch] Since arriving at the rear hospitals of the military region, the Experimental Drama Troupe of the Art College of Peking University has toured and performed at the General Hospital and the Second and Fifth Branch Hospitals. They have been deeply welcomed by the wounded and sick comrades and the recuperating comrades of the honor guard brigade. On August 9th, in order to cooperate with the hospital in welcoming the major reception mission, the entire troupe formed five teams, with an additional central team, under the direct leadership of troupe leader Guang Weiran, and published an oil-printed "Glory" three-day journal, actively carrying out the work of stabilizing the emotions of the newly wounded soldiers. They helped with management work in various wards, washing faces, feeding, and emptying bedpans for the wounded comrades, or carrying the wounded to the toilet, sometimes moving the wounded comrades to tears. Songs were heard in the wards. Recitations and clappership were especially welcome. In particular, the publicity about the new therapies played a great role, whereas in the past this was a tricky problem for the hospital, because the wounded did not understand the miraculous effects of the new therapies and often felt dissatisfied. Each team, although only a dozen people, organized evening parties one after another, performing small operas. For the seriously wounded, they held indoor a cappella performances, giving the wounded a lot of comfort. They also assisted the hospital in organizing the wounded into classes, platoons, and companies, and establishing clubs in each ward and company. Wall newspapers were also established one after another. Taking time off, they also went to mobilize and organize the villagers to help with the hospital work; they personally took the lead in launching a blood-stained clothing washing campaign. Now, the Second Hospital's reception mission has been successfully completed. Now, the third team, under the leadership of deputy troupe leader Lü Ban, has gone to work at the Third Hospital.

    分组到后方医院
    北大剧团慰劳伤员
    【本报讯】北方大学艺术学院实验剧团，自抵军区后方医院后，曾巡回出演于总院及二、五分院。深待伤病同志及荣誉大队休养同志的欢迎。八月九日为配合院方迎接大收容任务。全团组成五个分队，另设一中心组，在光未然团长直接领导下，出刊一油印“光荣”三日刊，积极展开安定新伤员情绪的工作。他们在各个病房中帮助管理工作，给伤员同志洗脸、喂饭、端屎尿盆，或者背着伤员到厕所去，有时伤员同志感动得流泪。病房中，歌声相闻。朗诵快板，受到特别的欢迎。尤其关于新疗法的宣传，在从前，这是院方颇感棘手的问题，因为伤员不了解新疗法的神效，常感不满。这次的宣传与推动，起了很大的作用。每分队虽仅十余人，都相继组织晚会，演出小型歌剧。对重伤员则举行室内清唱，给伤员不少安慰。他们又协助院方，把伤员按班排连组织起来，在各所各连成立俱乐部。墙报也纷纷建立起来了。抽暇又去发动与组织驻村群众，帮助医院工作；曾亲自带头展开洗血衣运动。现在，二院入收容任务已胜利完成。现第三分队，在吕班副团长领导下，又往三院工作。
