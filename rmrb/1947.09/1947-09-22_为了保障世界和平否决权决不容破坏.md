    *Pravda* Publishes Article

    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th—Moscow Dispatch: *Pravda* recently published an article by Mikhailov, "On the Veto and Its Opponents," stating that due to Austria's proposal, the issue of restricting the use of the veto has been brought up again on the agenda of the United Nations General Assembly. Recently, some American, British, and French newspapers have clamored that the veto is the greatest "scourge" invented by the Bolsheviks, with the aim of making the American, British, and Soviet representatives on the Security Council "neurasthenic." In reality, it is not only the Soviet Union that cares about the veto, but all member states of the United Nations. It was not the Soviet Union, but Roosevelt who proposed having the veto power. However, because the Soviet Union adopted the veto, the Security Council has not become a rubber-stamp body for approving the imperialist policies of certain powerful nations. Thus, those fanatical imperialist politicians have proposed to "revise" and "restrict" the veto, if they cannot abolish it altogether. They slander the Soviet Union's voting against proposals that are harmful to peace and the security of all the world's peoples as an "abuse" of the veto. In fact, thanks to the Soviet veto, the United States and Greek fascists have been prevented from shifting their provocative actions on the northern border of Greece onto other countries. The Soviet Union's use of the veto is not only not a violation of the principle of equality among UN member states, but precisely safeguards the rights of small countries and protects them from imperialist aggression.

    为了保障世界和平否决权决不容破坏
    【新华社陕北二十日电】莫斯科讯：真理报顷发表米哈洛夫论文“论否决权及其反对者”称：由于奥国的提议，限制使用否决权的问题又被提到联合国全体大会的议事日程上了。最近一部份美英法报纸叫嚣着否决权是布尔什维克所发明的最大“祸害”，其目的要使安理会中美英代表“神经衰弱。”实际上，关心否决权的，不只苏联而是联合国全体会员国，倡议有否决权的不是苏联而是罗斯福。然而，由于苏联采用否决权的原故，安理会没有变成批准某些强国帝国主义政策的盖印机关，于是那些疯狂的帝国主义政客们，便提出了如不能取消至少也要“修改”和“限制”否决权。它们把苏联投票反对那些有害于和平与全世界各族人民安全的事业的提案，污蔑为“滥用”否决权。事实上，幸亏苏联的否决，才阻止了美国与希腊法西斯想把在希北边界的挑拨性行动推到其他国家的身上。苏联使用否决权，不但不是破坏联合国会员国平等的原则，而且恰恰是保障了各小国的权利与免受帝国主义侵略。
