　　Protect the Autumn Harvest and Plant Wheat Extensively
    【Reported by this newspaper】In order to protect the autumn harvest and plant wheat extensively, the Border Region Government and Military Command recently issued a joint directive to governments at all levels, military regions, and corps, calling for an unprecedented effort to successfully complete this urgent task. The full text of the directive will be published in this newspaper and broadcast by the New China News Agency branches to various regions. No separate document will be issued. It is hoped that military, government, and civilian personnel in all areas will pay attention to and earnestly implement it. The original text of the joint directive is as follows:
    This year's autumn harvest is the victorious fruit of the entire region's military and civilians after a severe self-defense war, land reform, and overcoming disasters such as drought, insects, and hail; it is the material foundation for preparing for a comprehensive counter-offensive and launching a large-scale production campaign next year. Due to the crop failures in many areas, coupled with the consumption of ten years of war and the current intense patriotic self-defense war, difficulties in labor and livestock have been created, making this year's autumn harvest task even more arduous. It must be especially noted that the enemy, the landlords, secret agents etc in the border areas and those besieged by us, will definitely use all means to sabotage our autumn harvest and autumn plowing, and to seize grain and conscript men. Therefore, our military and civilians throughout the region must make unprecedented efforts, carry forward the following experiences, and successfully complete this urgent task.
    I. Combine Labor and Military Affairs, Harvest and Store Quickly: All agencies and troops in border areas and guerrilla areas should vigorously assist the masses in distributing fields and autumn crops, protecting fields and autumn crops, and guarding grain and conscripted men. Combine land reform with the autumn harvest, and distributing land must not delay the autumn harvest. The military and the people as one, widely develop labor-military mutual aid teams, organize village, district, and county-level joint defense of farming and harvesting, holding a gun in one hand and a sickle in the other, blockading strongholds, and attacking the enemy to protect the autumn harvest. Rush to harvest, rush to transport, rush to thresh, rush to store, ensuring that the enemy does not seize a single grain or capture a single able-bodied man or a single livestock.
    II. Organize All Labor Force, Harvest and Plant Quickly: Mobilize all labor force, including men, women, the old, and the young, as well as livestock, organize them, and harvest, plow, and plant simultaneously; and, according to the local climate and the maturity of crops, organize mutual support in a planned way, and adjust labor and livestock to remedy the difficulty of the lack of labor and livestock. Achieve no delay in harvesting, plowing, and planting; achieve no delay in both production and war.
    III. Plant Wheat Extensively, Eliminate Wasteland: Due to the crop failures in many areas, the entire region must universally strive to plant wheat extensively and strive to eliminate wasteland; this is especially important in disaster-stricken areas. In some places where autumn seedlings are planted late, intercropping of autumn land should be promoted to avoid delaying wheat planting. You must know that missing one season delays the whole year.
    IV. Agencies and Troops Should Help with Harvesting and Planting: All kinds of agencies and troops must help the masses in their stationed areas with the harvesting and planting campaign, especially helping military families, disabled veterans, and emancipated masses who lack manpower and livestock with harvesting and planting. Local governments should organize the collection, cultivation, and planting on behalf of military families and disabled veterans to solve their difficulties and stabilize the morale of the troops going to war; but they must also be mobilized to participate in the autumn harvest and wheat planting campaign together. In addition to besieging and attacking the enemy to protect the autumn harvest, the field troops in the border areas should also seize the gaps in the war to help the masses with farming and harvesting; and mobilize civilian laborers to work for the masses for a short period. It is strictly forbidden to waste the people's labor, stop unnecessary errands, and implement the Central Bureau's instructions on saving the people's labor.
    V. Pay Special Attention to Strict Prevention of Floods: The bandit Chiang intentionally floods the people in the liberated areas to alleviate his military straits; he decided on August 14th to breach the Da Fan Dyke of the Qin River in Wuzhi, causing the people of Wuzhi and Xiuwu to suffer devastating floods. He also dug up the Huanghe Guanmeng Dyke belonging to Changyuan on August 15th, diverting the Yellow River water northward, attempting to destroy our unprecedented bumper harvest in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region in ten years. Fortunately, our military and civilians made vigorous efforts to rescue the situation, turning danger into safety. There is no doubt that the bandit Chiang will continue to use rising water to carry out sinister schemes. We must be a hundred times vigilant, the military and civilians should cooperate, carefully protect the dikes, rush to harvest and plant, and carefully store grain, and defeat any conspiracy of the traitors. Other areas prone to flooding should also pay attention to prevention and not be negligent in the slightest.
    This year's autumn cold is early, and the time for harvesting and wheat planting is very tight, and it is combined with the intense war and land reform, the task is very heavy. All military and civilians must be a hundred times more vigilant, stop unnecessary work, send a large number of cadres, go deep into the masses and deep into the border areas, combine the troops with the masses, widely carry out the merit-making competition movement, and complete the autumn harvest, wheat planting, and protection of the autumn harvest. Any phenomenon of neglecting the interests of the masses and being lax and negligent should be criticized or punished.

　　边府暨军区联合指示所属
  　保卫秋收大量种麦
    【本报讯】边区政府暨军区为保卫秋收及大量种麦，顷向各级政府、各军区、各兵团发布联合指示，号召以空前努力胜利完成此一紧急任务。该指示由本报全文发表及由新华总分社播送各地，不另行文，希各区军政民注意切实执行：联合指示原文如下：
    今年的秋收是全区军民经过严重的自卫战争与土地改革和战胜旱、虫、雹等灾的胜利成果；是准备全面大反攻和开展明年大生产运动的物质基础。由于不少地区的灾荒歉收，加以十年战争的消耗，和当前爱国自卫战争之剧烈，造成劳力畜力的困难，使今年秋收任务更加重了。尤须看到边沿区和被我围困的蒋阎顽伪地主特务，一定要以一切办法破坏我之秋收秋耕及抢粮抓丁。为此，我全区军民必须空前努力，发扬以下经验，来胜利的完成这一紧急任务。
    一、劳武结合，快收快藏：边沿区及游击区之各机关部队，要大力帮助群众分田分秋，保田保秋，护粮护丁。土改与秋收结合，分田不误秋收。军民一体，广泛发展劳武结合的互助组，组织村区县的耕收联防，一手拿枪，一手拿镰，封锁据点，打击敌人，以保卫秋收。抢收抢运，抢碾抢藏，做到不让敌人抢走一粒粮食和抓走一个壮丁与一匹牲口。
    二、组织一切劳力，快收快种：动员男女老幼全部劳力及畜力，组织起来，边收边耕边种；并根据各地气候及庄稼成熟的早晚，有计划的组织相互支援，调剂劳畜力，以补救劳畜力缺乏的困难。作到收耕种三不误；作到生产战争两不误。
    三、大量种麦，消灭荒地：由于不少地区的灾荒歉收，全区必须普遍争取大量种麦，争取消灭荒地；在灾荒区尤为重要。有些地方秋苗种得晚，要提倡秋地串种，以免误了种麦。须知错过一季，便耽误一年。
    四、机关部队，帮助收种：各种机关部队，一律须帮助驻地群众的收种运动，特别要帮助缺乏人力畜力的军属荣誉军人翻身群众收种。各地政府要很好的组织对军属荣誉军人的代收代耕代种，以解决其困难，安定出征军心；但亦必须动员他们一齐参加秋收种麦运动。边沿区之野战部队除围困打击敌人保卫秋收外，还应抓紧战争空隙，帮助群众耕收；并动员民夫为群众打短。严禁浪费民力，停止不必要的支差，贯彻中央局节约民力的指示。
    五、特别注意严防水灾：蒋贼蓄意水淹解放区人民，以济其军事之穷；已于八月十四日决溃沁河之武陟大樊堤，使武陟修武人民惨遭淹没。又曾于八月十五日扒开长垣属之黄河贯孟堤，引黄河水北流，企图破坏我冀鲁豫十年未有之大丰收。幸经我军民奋力抢救，始化险为夷。无疑问，蒋贼是会利用水涨继续下毒手的。必须百倍警惕，军民协力，小心护堤与抢收抢种，更要妥为藏粮，击破卖国贼之任何阴谋。其他易致水灾的地区，均应注意防范，勿稍疏忽。
    今年秋寒较早，收割种麦之时间是十分紧迫的，又与剧烈的战争和土地改革相结合，任务十分繁重。全体军民必须百倍紧张起来，停止不必要的工作，派遣大批干部，深入群众深入边缘区，结合部队与群众，广泛的开展立功竞赛运动，完成秋收种麦与保卫秋收。任何漠视群众利益松懈玩忽的现象，应该受到批评或处罚。
