    The Honor Plaque Should Be Hung on One's Own Door
    Jia Qingshan
    Comrade Li Jinwang, the branch secretary of the Special Service Company directly under the brigade, recounted a heartbreaking story during the recent grievance-airing movement. He immediately made a request to his superiors: "Please hang the honor plaque for the family of a revolutionary soldier on my own door." His superiors granted this reasonable request.
    It turns out that Li Jinwang's real name was Yang Guixiu. He was truly a member of the Yang family, from Beitianzhang Village in the first district of Xiangyuan. Because his family was poor, his father owed the landlord Li Tuhai of Majiazhuang one shi of rent. Although the interest exceeded four times the rent, the rent could never be repaid. However, there were four or five children in the family. Li Tuhai's family had no children, only a foolish daughter who wasn't worth much, so foolish she couldn't even comb her hair or do any work. Because of this, he intentionally pressured old Yang for the rent, and in the end, old Yang really couldn't produce a single grain of rent. He then slowly said a set of words, pretending to care for him:
    "If you really can't pay it back, you have four or five children. Just give me one, and you won't have to pay me rent anymore, and your burden will be lighter. The child won't suffer hunger or cold in my house."
    What could old Yang do? The rent had to be paid, and although the child was his own flesh and blood, he had to give him up. Gritting his teeth, he gave Yang Guixiu to Li Tuhai as a son. From then on, Yang Guixiu changed his name and surname and was called Li Jinwang.
    That's not all. Li Tuhai had a second wish: to marry his unmarriageable little daughter to this adopted son, so that everything would be settled. Therefore, he forced Yang Guixiu to marry his daughter. At this time, Yang Guixiu was already nineteen years old, and he knew right from wrong, but because he said no, he was scolded by Li Tuhai:
    "You want to go to heaven, but you can't! You follow me, so you have to listen to me."
    Yang Guixiu held his nose and got married, truly shedding tears in his stomach, unable to express his suffering. Besides working as a servant for the Li family, he also had to serve his wife by combing her hair every day.
    Later, Yang Guixiu found his own way out and joined the Eighth Route Army. The "Honorary Military Family" plaque was hung on the door of Li Tuhai's house. Yang Guixiu didn't think much about it originally, but he often thought about how he became someone else's son, took someone else's surname, and didn't even have the freedom to marry the woman he wanted. These things made him secretly sad, until the grievance-airing movement was launched in the army, and he was finally able to tell everyone his grievances.
    After airing his grievances, Yang Guixiu felt lighter, and his thoughts became much clearer. He thought, "We were poor at home, suffering from the oppression and exploitation of the landlord Li Tuhai. He told us to be his son, and we had to be his son; he told us to be his son-in-law, and we had to be his son-in-law; he told us to take the name Li, and we didn't dare to use the name Yang. Now that we've come out to make revolution, the landlord Li's house is hanging an honor plaque. All the advantages in the world are taken by the landlords!"
    The more he thought about it, the more sad he felt, and the more angry he became. Finally, he made up his mind to sever his father-son relationship with the landlord Li Tuhai, divorce the landlord's daughter, abandon the name the landlord gave him, and reclaim his real name, Yang Guixiu. The honor plaque should also be hung on his own door.

    光荣牌要挂到自己门上
    贾青山
    旅直属特务连的支部书记李金旺同志，在最近的诉苦运动中，诉说了一段伤心事，他马上向上级提出一个要求：“请把我革命军人家属的光荣牌，挂到我自己家的门上去”。上级允许了他这个合理的要求。
    原来李金旺名字叫杨贵秀，千真万确的是杨家的子孙，他是襄垣一区北田章村人，只因家贫，他父亲短了马家庄地主李土孩的一石租，上利虽超过了租子的四倍，租老是还不起，可是家里却有四五个孩子，李土孩家没有孩子，只有一个不够数的傻闺女，傻的连头也不会梳，活也不会做，因为这也有意的向老杨逼租，逼到最后，老杨实在拿不出一颗租子，他才慢条斯理的说了一套假装关心他的话：
    “你实在还不起的话，你家孩们四五个，只要你给我一个，你租子也不用还我了，担子也轻些，孩子在我家不能叫受一点饥寒。”
    老杨有什么办法呢，租子人家非要不行，孩子虽是自己的骨肉，也不得不给人家割下，咬着牙把杨贵秀给了李土孩当儿，从此杨贵秀改名换姓，就叫了李金旺。
    这还不说，李土孩还有第二个心愿，要把嫁不出门的小闺女，嫁给这讨来的儿，这样一来后事就都办妥啦，因此他又迫着杨贵秀和他的女儿结了婚，这时杨贵秀已是十九岁的人了，什么好坏不懂得呢？只为说了个不字，便遭到李土孩的一顿臭骂：
    “你想上天，可是由不得你了，跟了老子，就得听老子的话。”
    杨贵秀捏着鼻子结了婚，真是眼泪往肚里流，有苦难言，除了给李家当伙计，每天还得服侍老婆梳头。
    后来杨贵秀找着自己的出路，参加了八路军，李土孩家的门上，挂起了“光荣军属”的牌牌来了。杨贵秀对这原也没去多想，只是常常想着自己当了别人的儿，姓了别人的姓，娶个老婆也没有自己的自由，这些事，使他只有暗自伤心，直到部队里开展诉苦运动时，他才算把这苦衷对大家诉了出来。
    诉了苦的杨贵秀，心里轻快了，一些思想也觉得开朗得多了，他想到“咱在家是个穷人，受尽地主李土孩的压迫和剥削，叫咱当儿、就当儿，叫咱当婿，就当婿，叫咱姓李，不敢姓杨，咱出来革命了，他姓李的门前又挂上光荣牌，世上的便宜都被地主占完了。”
    他越想越伤心，越想越生气，最后下了决心，和地主李土孩脱离父子关系，和地主的闺女离婚，抛弃地主给他的名字，重新把自己的真名杨贵秀唤起来，光荣牌也要在自己门上挂起来。
