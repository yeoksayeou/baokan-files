Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, September 24th: New York dispatch: The United Nations General Assembly concluded its general debate from the 19th to the 22nd. Representatives from various countries delivered speeches, expressing their attitudes towards various issues of the General Assembly. According to a report by Zhukov, a Pravda special correspondent at the UN General Assembly on the 22nd, "The Soviet Union's opinions on various issues, as expounded by Vyshinsky, firmly seized the initiative of the General Assembly and became the center of the Assembly's work."

The head of the Belarusian delegation, Kiselev, pointed out in his speech on the 19th that the UN's work in the past year had failed to achieve important resolutions such as universal disarmament, atomic energy control, the severance of relations between member states and Spain, and the extradition and punishment of war criminals. He demanded that the current General Assembly pass a resolution to ensure the true implementation of these resolutions. He reminded the Assembly with the following facts: the Dutch invasion of Indonesia, the fascist terror in Greece, the civil war in China, the existence of the Spanish fascist government, and the latent fascist forces in Germany and Japan. He then concluded: "The international reactionary forces that once supported Hitler and Mussolini have no intention of abandoning their struggle against the democratic and progressive forces." He solemnly declared that Belarus opposed any modification of the United Nations Charter and the veto power, opposed the establishment of a so-called "Interim Committee on Peace and Security" to replace the functions of the Security Council, and resolutely demanded the punishment of new war propagandists headed by the United States.

Yugoslav representative Simic also opposed the establishment of the "Interim Committee on Peace and Security," and condemned the US and Britain for launching and supporting the Greek civil war while shifting responsibility to Greece's neighbors, demanding the withdrawal of foreign troops from Greece. On the same day, Swedish representative Undén demanded that all countries be united in spirit and action. He said: "No amendment to the Charter can replace the essential element of peace, which is the harmony and cooperation of the major powers." Indian representative Pandit pointed out that the attempt by certain major powers to form opposing blocs has caused concern among people around the world. She believes that "the Charter should not be arbitrarily amended today." Representatives from Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Lebanon, and Syria expressed dissatisfaction with the Palestine partition plan, sharply criticized the US policy of supporting Jews, and warned that Arab countries would have no choice but to rise up in self-defense if necessary. The Syrian representative also emphasized that "the US and the Soviet Union should cooperate" and advocated that "amendments to the veto power must be agreed upon by the five powers."

British representative McNeil openly defended Marshall's actions to undermine the United Nations in his speech, and "sang in harmony" with the United States on the Greek issue, disarmament, and other issues. French representative Bidault's attitude was ambiguous in his speech. On the one hand, he said that he was "willing to fully study the proposal to amend the veto power," and on the other hand, he said: "The amendment of the Charter is not the solution to the problems we face."

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, September 21st: London dispatch: The London Daily Worker's Paris correspondent reported: At 7 pm on the 17th, Marshall held a private meeting with Bidault after the UN General Assembly. Marshall hinted to Bidault that the United States could provide France and Italy with some form of loan, but Bidault had to support the US proposal at the UN General Assembly to establish an "Interim Committee on Peace and Security" in order to undermine the United Nations, and guarantee that the French government would not accommodate communists. The rumored "Franco-Italian Customs Union" is also related to this type of loan.

    联大结束一般性辩论
    苏联意见掌握主动权
    【新华社陕北二十四日电】纽约讯：自十九日至廿二日之联合国大会已结束一般性之辩论。会上各国代表分别发言，表示对联大各项问题之态度。据真理报联大特派记者朱可夫二十二日报导称：“维辛斯基阐述的苏联对各项问题之意见，牢牢地掌握了大会的主动权，成为大会工作的中心。”白俄罗斯代表团团长基雪列夫在十九日的演辞中指出，过去一年的联大工作，没有实现普遍裁军、原子能管制、各会员国与西班牙绝交、战犯之引渡与惩处等重要决议，并要求本届大会通过议案，保证这些决议的真正执行。他以下列事实提醒大会：荷兰对印尼的进攻、希腊的法西斯恐怖、中国之内战、西班牙法西斯政府之存在以及德日法西斯力量之潜存等，然后下结论说：“曾维护希特勒与墨索里尼的国际反动力量，无意放弃其对民主进步力量之斗争。”他严正的声明：白俄罗斯反对任何对联合国宪章及否决权的修改，反对成立代替安理会职权的所谓“和平安全临时委员会”，并坚决要求惩处以美国为首的新战争宣传者。南斯拉夫代表西米克亦反对成立“和平安全临时委员会”，并斥责美英发动与支持希腊内战而将责任卸于希腊邻国之行为，要求撤退希腊的外国军队。同日，瑞典代表恩登要求各国精神及行动都须团结，他说：“任何宪章的改变，都不足代替和平之要素，此项要素即为各大国之和谐与合作。”印度代表潘迪特夫人指斥某些大国企图组成敌对集团，已引起全世界人民的顾虑。她认为“今天不应任意修改宪章”。萨地阿拉伯、埃及、黎巴嫩与叙利亚等国代表，不满于巴勒斯坦分治计划，尖锐抨击美国支持犹太人之政策，并警告称：阿拉伯国家于必要时，只有起而自卫。叙利亚代表且强调“美苏应合作”，主张“修改否决权必须得到五强之同意”。英代表麦克纳尔在演说中公开为马歇尔破坏联合国之行动诡辩，并在希腊问题上，裁军等问题上，与美国“合唱”。法代表比道尔演说中态度模棱，他一方面表示“愿充分研究修改否决权之建议”，另一方面又说：“宪章之修正并非我们面临问题之解决方法。”
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】伦敦讯：英工人日报驻巴黎特派员称：十七日午后七时，马歇尔在联大会后与比道尔举行私人会谈。马氏示意比道尔，美国可给予法、意两国以某种形式的贷款，但要比道尔支持美国为破坏联合国而在联大所提设立“和平安全临时委员会”之建议，并保证法政府不容纳共产党人。传闻中的“法意关税同盟”，当亦与此种贷款有关。
