　　Research on Mutual Aid in Mending Pots at Chongyi Base Point
    Han Huan, Shi Chang
  　I. The Origin of Mutual Aid
    The Chongyi base point in Wu'an includes six administrative villages: Nanzhuang, Chongyi, Dabeizhuang, Xiaobeizhuang, Beixizhuang, and Nanxizhuang. Mending pot carriers account for more than 50% of the total number of households. Among them, Chongyi had more than 400 households before the war, and could send out more than 200 carriers, involving three to four hundred people at its peak. In Nanxizhuang, mending pot households account for more than 80%, making it the most common sideline activity for the masses. During the enemy occupation, due to blockades and destruction, those who went out could not return, and most of them stopped working at home. After liberation, the masses were busy with emancipation and participating in the war. After obtaining land, they also felt a lack of labor, so there was no major development. This year, in April and May, when there was a drought, they restarted organizing in conjunction with drought prevention and famine preparation, but there were the following three difficulties: (1) The village lacked labor, and going out to work affected the work in the village and increased the burden on others, so people could not go out casually; (2) No one was responsible for participating in the war and supporting the front after individuals left; (3) After emancipation, people had land, but no one to cultivate it after they left. After discussion in mid-May, three principles for mutual aid with agriculture were determined: (1) According to the labor ratio of each village, one-tenth to one-fifth of the young and middle-aged laborers were drawn, and semi-auxiliary laborers were freely absorbed, with one carrier organized according to two to three people; (2) For short-term activities within half a month, semi-auxiliary laborers were organized into carriers to nearby areas. They could return home when busy and not delay farming, and there were no restrictions; (3) For long-term activities in remote areas, lasting from one month to three months, the mutual aid group would uniformly organize, combining agriculture and sideline occupations, changing work points and dividing profits. By mid-June, the villages were generally organized. According to statistics: Chongyi had 56 people, Beixizhuang 10 people, Nanxizhuang 2 people, and Dabeizhuang 10 people, earning a profit of 2 million yuan in one month (some have not yet returned, not included in the statistics).

    II. Organizational Methods in Various Villages
    Beixizhuang sent out five carriers, ten people, earning 660,000 yuan in silver. The mutual aid group arranged for each household of those who went out to cultivate eight mu of land on their behalf. Upon their return, each carrier would be compensated 20,000 yuan from the total profit for the labor of cultivation. The remaining land was managed by the mutual aid group, but the wages were paid by the returning members after profit sharing. The profit sharing ratio was that after deducting the 20,000 yuan wage for cultivation from the total profit, the net profit was divided equally between the group and the returning members. Nanxizhuang drew one labor force from ten people, forming one carrier. In 33 days, they earned 170,000 yuan in silver. The group cultivated the land of those who went out on their behalf, and the returning members paid wages after profit sharing. The group was responsible for supporting the front. The total profit was divided with the group receiving 30% and the returning members 70%. Dabeizhuang had five carriers, ten people. The group was responsible for the land. One month of carrier furniture generated a profit of 1,000 yuan. The profit was divided with the group receiving 30% and the returning members 70%. Chongyi First Street engaged in short-term activities with 17 people. Individuals found their own relationships, entrusting others to cultivate the land and support the front. The profits earned belonged to them, and were not shared with the group. They only paid the cultivators, such as the mutual aid group stipulating six jin of rice per day for wages, so when finding someone to cultivate, they would give seven or eight jin of rice per work day, or give some more money. Sun Suozhu’s joint group in Fourth Street had 34 full and semi-laborers, equivalent to 22.5 full laborers. They drew three full laborers and five and a half semi-laborers, organized three carriers, and stipulated that for each full laborer who went out, the group would cultivate seven mu of land on their behalf, and for each semi-laborer, five mu. It was further stipulated that the wage for cultivating each mu was two and a half jin of rice, and the wage for hoeing was fifteen jin (or two and a half work days). The wages were deducted from the total profit of mending pots. The group was responsible for the remaining land, but the wages were paid by the returning members after profit sharing. The group was also responsible for supporting the front. The net profit was divided with the group receiving 60% and the returning members 40%. If there were three full and semi-laborers, the full laborer would receive 40% and the semi-laborer 30%. If there were two, the full laborer would receive 60% and the semi-laborer 40%. For example, Sun Maogang’s carrier consisted of one full laborer and two semi-laborers, earning 160,000 yuan in 40 days. The group first deducted 10,000 yuan for cultivation wages, leaving 150,000 yuan. The group received 90,000 yuan (60%) and the returning members 60,000 yuan (40%). The 34 full and semi-laborers in the entire group (equivalent to 22.5 full laborers, including those who went out, shared the profits uniformly), with each full laborer averaging 4,000 yuan and each semi-laborer 2,000 yuan. The three who went out, the full laborer received 24,000 yuan plus the uniformly distributed profits, totaling 28,000 yuan, and each semi-laborer received 18,000 yuan plus the uniformly distributed profits, totaling 20,000 yuan. In Fifth Street, the land of those who went out was cultivated by the mutual aid group on their behalf, and the group also took over supporting the front. Upon return, the profits were divided with the group receiving 30% and the returning members 70%. The wages for cultivating the land and supporting the front were paid by the returning members from their share of the profits.

    III. Research on Several Issues
    The Chongyi base point is a new district, and the mutual aid organization has no foundation. The combination of agriculture and sideline occupations is just beginning. Based on the above situation, the following issues in mending pot mutual aid are proposed for research:

    (1) Mending pots is a running-around business. One can travel to several villages and dozens of miles in a day, and then go to different villages and different roads the next day (sometimes one can stay in a village for three or two days, but rarely). Therefore, the time spent going out must be quite ample. According to the calculations in Chongyi base point in June, running to nearby neighbors is not as profitable as running to distant places, and the closer the neighbors, the less work there is, and the less profit there is. Running long distances requires more and more people, and the farther the distance, the longer the time required. Due to such a condition, when changing work and helping each other with others, it is more complicated than other short-term transportation and picking and cutting. In addition to a small number of people who run to nearby neighbors and can flexibly balance agriculture and sideline occupations by going out when there is nothing to do and returning when there is something to do, most of those who go out to distant places must go through longer periods of arrangement. Using a contracting method, such as the land of the family who goes out is several mu, the mutual aid group contracts to cultivate it, stipulating the number of work days and wages, and settling the account upon return. Or a method of combining cultivation and profit sharing, such as when everyone has the technology and can go out, the group discusses and draws a certain amount of labor to go out, and the group cultivates the land at home on their behalf. The profits are distributed according to a ratio of 30/70, 20/80, 40/60, etc., or redistributed after deducting wages. Mutual benefit is achieved between the group and those who go out. The profit sharing ratio is determined according to the technical conditions and the degree of labor shortage. When there is a shortage of technology, the profit sharing ratio of those who go out should be increased. When there is a shortage of labor, the interests of those at home should be appropriately taken care of, and the contracting wages or profit sharing ratio should be increased. It is not appropriate to emphasize one party or remain unchanged regardless of the situation. (2) The issue of wages for cultivating land and supporting the front on behalf: Because mending pots is a running-around and uncertain business, there is no certainty in the profit, sometimes high, sometimes low. If the group cultivates land and supports the front on behalf without pre-determining a certain wage ratio and relying solely on profit sharing, it will sometimes be unreliable. It is necessary to stipulate wages for cultivating land and to increase the wages for cultivation. For example, if others receive six jin of rice, the wage for cultivation is stipulated to be seven or eight jin, etc., so that the group has a guarantee for cultivation. Those who go out earn more, and even if they earn less, they will not lose money after deducting wages. This is also a way to take care of both ends. Some do not stipulate wages or find someone to be responsible, resulting in those who go out not being able to return, and others being unwilling to cultivate on their behalf, forming a situation of neglecting one thing and losing another, affecting production. (3) The issue of rewarding surplus labor and giving play to the role of surplus labor: From the mutual aid materials of Chongyi base point, there is no mention of rewarding the surplus labor within the group and giving greater play to the initiative of the surplus labor. Therefore, the following situations still exist within the group: First, after those with less labor and more land go out, the group is responsible for the cultivation of the land, and the burden on the group is increased according to the general wages, and the surplus labor cannot go out again. The wages for cultivating land are not equal to the profits from sideline occupations. Although some have already increased the wages for cultivation and adopted profit sharing, the distance to equivalence is still far away when everyone has the technology and can go out, causing those with more labor and less land to suffer. Second, after those with more labor and less land go out, there is not much land at home, and the group can cultivate it with only a few laborers. In some cases, there are people at home who can cultivate it. The group does very little or no work, and purely shares the profits of those who go out. The group benefits from those who go out invisibly. Third, after the profits are shared within the group, the interests of those with more land and fewer people and those with less land and more people are not equal. There is no distinction between high and low, and the profits are shared equally, causing those with more labor and less land to suffer. Those with less labor and more land use the labor of others in the group on their own land, and also receive sideline profits, forming a double profit. Fourth, there are also differences between those who go out to mend pots and share profits within the group, those who pick and cut at home and keep the profits for themselves, those who go on long-term journeys and belong to the group, those who go to nearby neighbors for short periods and belong to individuals, and those who go out and stay at home, mend pots and pick and cut, and go on long and short journeys. This affects the emotions of those who go out and creates an imbalance and lack of unity in the use of labor within the group. How to further accurately calculate, reward surplus labor, and seek unified use of surplus labor, and the reasonable distribution of profits, is an important issue for achieving future sideline development.

　　崇义基点补锅互助的研究
    韩寰　世昌
  　一、互助的起源
    武安崇义基点，包括南庄、崇义、大北庄、小北庄、北西庄、南西庄六个行政村，补锅担子占总户数百分之五十以上，其中崇义战前四百多户，最多时能出担子二百多付，三四百人；南西庄补锅户占百分之八十多，是群众最普遍的副业活动。敌占期间，因遭封锁破坏，出去的不能回来，大部停顿在家。解放后群众又因忙于翻身、参战，在取得土地后劳力又感缺乏的情况下，也没有大的发展。今年四五月时天旱不雨，结合防旱备荒，重新开始组织，但有以下三种困难：（一）村上劳力缺乏，劳力外出影响村中工作，加重别人负担，不能随便外出；（二）个人走后参战支差没人负责；（三）翻身有了土地，走后没人耕种。五月中经过讨论，确定与农业互助三个原则：（一）按各村劳力比例，青壮年抽十分之一到五分之一，半辅劳力自由吸收，一条担子按二人到三人组织；（二）短期活动半月以内，以半辅劳力组织担子到邻近地带，忙时回家不误耕种，亦不加限制；（三）长时间远地活动，一月至三个月，由互助组统一组织，农副结合，变工分红，六月中各村便普遍组织起来。据统计：崇义五十六人，北西庄十人，南西庄二人，大北庄十人，一月得利二百万元（有一部分尚未回来，未统计在内）。
    二、各村的组织办法
    北西庄出五付担子，十个人，赚洋六十六万元。由互助组给出外人每家代种八亩地，回来时由得利总数中一条担子补偿代种工资两万元，下余土地互助组管种，但工资由出外人分红后付给。分红比例是红利总数除每条担子抽付代种工资两万元外，净利组内和出外人各得一半。南西庄十人抽一劳力，一条担子，三十三天赚洋十七万元，出外人土地由组内代种，出外人回来分红后交付工资。支差参战组内负责，总红利按组内三分、出外人七分分红。大北庄五条担子、十个人，土地组内负责，担子家具一月出利一千元，红利按组内三分出外人七分分红，崇义一街短期活动，十七人，由个人各找关系，托人代种地代支差，回来得利归自己，不给组内分红，只给代种人报酬，如工资互助组规定一天六斤，找人代种时就一工给七斤或八斤米，或多给些钱，四街孙所柱联合组，全半劳力三十四人，折合全劳力二十二个半，抽出三个全劳力，五个半劳力；组织担子三付，规定出外全劳力一人由组内代种土地七亩，半劳力代种五亩，每亩又规定种上工资米二斤半，锄好工资米十五斤（或者两个半工），工资由补锅总红利中扣除，下余土地组内负责，但工资由出外人分红后付给，支差参战亦由组内负责，净利按组内六、出外人四分红。出外人全半劳力如系三人，再按全劳力一人得四分，半劳力一人得三分分配；如系两人即按全劳力六分，半劳力四分分红。如孙毛缸一条担子一个全劳力两个半劳力，四十天赚回十六万元，组内先除去种地工资一万元，下余十五万元，组内按六得九万元，出外人按四得六万元、全组全半劳力三十四个（折全劳力二十二个半，出外人在内，统一分红），每一个全劳力平均得四千元，半劳力得两千元，出外三人，全劳力得两万四千加上统一分红共得两万八千元，半劳力每人一万八千加上统一分红共得两万元。五街出外人土地由互助组代种，支差参战亦由组内顶工，回来红利按组内三出外七分红，种地工资和支差工米，由出外人分红内付还。
    三、几个问题的研究
    崇义基点是新区，互助组织没有基础，农副结合只是开始，根据以上情况，补锅互助中还有以下几个问题提出研究：
    （一）补锅是一种跑腿营生，一天就可以走几个村子，几十里路，第二天又是另换村子，另走路（有时也能在一个村中住三两天，但很少），因此出外时间就要相当充裕才行，根据崇义基点六月份的计算，跑近邻的都赶不上跑远处的利大，而且近邻越跑越没活，得利也就越少，跑远路就须越来越多，越远时间也就须要越长。由于有着这样一个条件的关系，在和别人变工互助时，就和其他的短期运输、拾砍不同，就要更加复杂。除了小部分跑近邻的可以根据情况，没事就出有事就回，灵活变动农副兼顾外，大部远出的就都须经过较长时期的安排。用包工办法，如出外人家中土地若干亩，由互助组包种，规定工数和工资，回来算帐。或代种结合分红办法，如遇大家都有技术，都能出外时，就由组内讨论，抽出一定劳力出外，家里土地组内代种，红利按比例三七、二八、四六等分配，或者除去工资再分配，组内出外互相有利，分红比例根据技术条件和劳力缺乏程度决定，技术缺时，应提高出外人的分红比例，劳力缺时，即应适当照顾在家人的利益，提高包工工资或分红比例。不根据情况，强调一方，或者一成不变都不合适。（二）代种土地代顶支差参战的工资问题：由于补锅是一种跑腿不定的营生，在获利的把握上也就没有一定，有时高，有时低，组内代种地代支差，如不预先确定一定的工资比例，单纯依靠分红，有时就要靠不住，规定代种地有工资，和提高代种工资是必要的，如别人六斤米，代种规定七斤、八斤等，使组内代种有了保证，出外人赚多多得，赚少了除开工资外也赔不了，也是一种两头照顾的办法。有的不规定工资，也不找人负责，结果出外不能回来，别人又不愿代种，形成顾此失彼，影响生产。（三）奖励剩余劳力，发挥剩余劳力作用问题：从崇义基点的互助材料看来，还没有提到对于组内剩余劳力的奖励，发挥剩余劳力更大的积极性。因此组内还存在着以下情况：第一、劳力少土地多的人出外后，土地耕种组内负责，按照一般工资，组内负担加重，剩余劳力不能再行外出，种地工资和副业利润不等，虽然有的已经提高代种工资和采取分红，但在大家都有技术，都能外出的情况下，距离等价仍然很远，而使劳力多地少的人吃亏。第二、劳力多地少的人出外后，家里土地不多，组内只用少数劳力就能种了，有的是出外人家里有人就能种了。组内出工很少，或不出工，净分出外人的红利，组内无形中沾了出外人的便宜。第三，分红到组内后，地多人少，地少人多中间的利害关系也不相等，不分高低，一样分红，劳力多地少的人就吃了亏，劳力少地多的人，自己土地在组就使用了别人的劳动，又得到副业利润，形成一种双重得利。第四、还有出外补锅得利组内分红，在家拾砍就归个人，长期远路归组内，短期近邻归个人，出外在家、补锅拾砍、远路近邻、长期短期中间也有了差别。影响了出外人的情绪和形成组内劳力使用上的不平衡，不统一现象。如何进一步的精确计算，奖励剩余劳动和求取剩余劳力的统一使用，利润的合理分配，是取得今后副业发展的重要问题。
