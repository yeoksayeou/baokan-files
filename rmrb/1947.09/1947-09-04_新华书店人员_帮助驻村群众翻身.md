Xinhua Bookstore Staff Help Villagers Overthrow Landlords

[This Newspaper News] Xinhua Bookstore staff are actively participating in the village-based emancipation movement. Since the beginning of this year, writer Comrade Zhao Shuli has frequently assisted in the village mass movement work. When improving the relationship between cadres and the masses and mobilizing cadres to "wash their faces" (confess their mistakes), he often patiently explained things to resolve ideological obstacles for some cadres and activists, even working for four or five nights in a row. During this re-examination movement, Comrade Zhao, along with comrades Guo Yong, Zhao Dexin, Li Shuqin from the bookstore, and the bookstore's editor-in-chief Comrade Wang Chun, participated from beginning to end. They constantly reasoned with the masses, supported them, and struck at the landlords; they participated in village meetings at all levels, helping village cadres. The bookstore's club even called on all comrades in the bookstore to vigorously support the mass movement. When the bookstore participated in mass struggle meetings, there were strict rules: no shouting or pushing, no being called away arbitrarily, so as not to shake the atmosphere of the meeting. Comrade Wang Chun further called on everyone to solemnly help the masses in their struggle, and absolutely oppose a "going to a temple fair" mentality. This also influenced other organizations stationed in the same village. Before the masses dug "air raid shelters," comrades from the bookstore's printing plant discovered two jars of wheat hidden by the landlord in the adobe bed in the house they were staying in (a house where the landlord had been struggled against last year). They immediately reported this to the farmers' association, and the masses took it away. This made the masses truly realize that the landlords still had a lot of things, and their fighting spirit was ignited. At this time, the club also instructed all comrades to carefully observe the actions of each landlord and landlord's family. After the "air raid shelter" digging movement began, the bookstore informed the village of the situation of each landlord's family, and some comrades even discovered three hidden bundles and other materials hidden by the landlords. All of this facilitated the work of the masses and helped the cadres and activists. At present, this group of comrades from the bookstore have become one with the village cadres, jointly planning work, promoting the movement, and their relationship with the masses is even closer.

  　帮助驻村群众翻身
    【本报讯】新华书店人员，积极参加驻村翻身运动。作家赵树理同志，今年以来，经常帮助驻村的群运工作。在改善干群关系，动员干部洗脸时，他为了解决某一些干部和积极分子的思想圪塔，常给他们耐心的解释，甚至一连搞四、五黑夜。在这次复查运动中，赵同志带同书店的国涌、赵德新、李书芹等同志和书店总编辑王春同志，都自始至终的参加了。随时给群众讲理撑腰，打击地主；参加村中各级会议，给村干部帮忙。书店俱乐部更号召全店同志大力支援群众运动。书店参加群众斗争大会时，都定有纪律：不许乱嚷乱挤，不许随便叫走，以免动摇会场空气。王春同志更号召大家要严肃的帮助群众斗争，绝对反对赶庙会心理。这点并影响了同驻一村的其它机关。在群众还未挖“防空洞”之前，书店印刷厂同志在驻房内（是个去年被斗地主的房子）的土炕里发现地主偷藏的两缸麦子，马上报告农会，由群众取去。这就使群众真正认识到地主东西还多，斗劲激发了起来。俱乐部这时还布置各同志，都要细心察看各个地主房东的行动。挖“防空洞”运动开始后，书店给村上谈了各个房东的情况，更有的同志发现了地主暗藏的包袱三个及其它物资等等。这些都便利了群众的工作，帮了干部和积极分子的忙。目前书店这一批同志已与村干部们打成一片，一道计划工作，推进运动，与群众关系，更加密切。（书店通讯组、毛）
