　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd. According to a TASS report citing the Shanghai Ta Kung Pao on the 29th: The Chiang government has issued an order to all shipping companies to have all their ships requisitioned for "war purposes" (meaning anti-people civil war purposes). Furthermore, according to a United Press report from Shanghai on the 1st: at least twenty to thirty merchant ships, each weighing approximately 3,000 tons, have now been requisitioned for military transport. “The requisition of some ships did not involve orders from the Ministry of Transportation, but rather forced departures under the duress of National Army officers wielding pistols, regardless of insufficient fuel and supplies.” The requisition of these ships has caused serious disruption to coastal transportation and navigation to Taiwan. Thousands upon thousands of people in Hong Kong are now waiting for months to purchase ship tickets. Private shipping in China has already been on the verge of collapse in recent years due to the heavy military burden imposed by the Chiang government and the oppression of state-run shipping by bureaucratic capital, and will be unable to sustain itself in the future.

　　蒋党强征船只充当内战军运
    【新华社陕北三日电】据塔斯社引沪大公报二十九日消息：蒋政府已通令各轮船公司将因“作战目的”（按即反人民内战目的）而征用其所有船只。又据合众社一日沪讯：现至少已有二十到三十只重约三千吨的商船被征充军运。“若干船只之征用并无交通部命令而在国军军官手枪驱逼下，不管燃料及供应品之不足被强迫开行的。”该项船只之被征用，已使沿海运输及与台湾间之航行，发生严重混乱，香港现正有成千成万的人为购船票，已空等达数月之久。按中国民营航业，年来因受蒋政府繁重军差与官僚资本的国营航业之压迫，本已日陷绝境，今后更将无法支持。
