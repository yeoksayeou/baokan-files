    Huangnian Strives for Equal Harvests from Both Main-Season and Replanted Wheat
    Rectify Mutual Aid to Advance Planting
    [Report from Lucheng by this newspaper] On the night of the 11th, Huangnian in the Fourth District convened a mass meeting of over 800 villagers to discuss wheat planting, rectifying mutual aid, and preparing for the autumn harvest. Wei Genxi from North Street said: "Our group originally had 93 mu of wheat land. Due to the spring drought this year, the wheat harvest was poor, and the autumn seedlings suffered from four disasters: drought, flood, wind, and hail, resulting in a 30% reduction in yield. We will not have enough grain to eat next spring. To supplement the grain shortage, our group will expand the wheat fields by 90 mu this year, totaling 183 mu. The fertilizer for the main-season wheat land is already prepared, with an average of 45 dan of dry manure per mu. The replanted wheat land will be entirely fertilized with night soil, guaranteeing that the replanted wheat will yield as much as the main-season wheat." They pledged to complete all planting before the 15th day of the eighth lunar month, with the slogan "Plant as soon as possible, regardless of the season; advance planting for replanted wheat to ensure it yields as much as the main-season wheat next year." Even before the corn stalks are harvested, they will be planted in alternating rows. Zhang Jinjiang from Middle Street said: "The wages in my group have not yet been settled, and I am very dissatisfied. Recently, I have not wanted to participate in mutual aid with them. After tonight's group discussion, the wage accounts will definitely be settled tomorrow. As long as the wages are settled, I guarantee that my group will complete planting before the 15th day of the eighth lunar month. Because autumn needs to come early in a dry year, we should quickly launch a concentrated effort." Each group is now rectifying the mutual aid teams, formulating plans to advance planting, and striving for equal harvests from both main-season and replanted wheat. Before the 15th day of the eighth lunar month, they guarantee to complete planting. The next day, the Zhu Fulong group in South Street had already planted 12 mu of wheat in one day.

    [Report from Shexian by this newspaper] On the 18th, the Seventh District of Shexian held a meeting of district and village cadres to discuss launching the autumn harvest and wheat planting campaign. Based on the mutual aid situation in the district over the past six months, it was pointed out that to launch this campaign, it is first necessary to conduct inspections from top to bottom and from bottom to top. Through inspections, it should be determined whether the mutual aid organizations are sound and whether there are shortages of seeds and farm tools. In the inspection and summary process, mutual aid should be rectified. Villages with narrow organizational coverage should compare the benefits of organizing with those of not organizing to mobilize them to organize. The focus of rectifying mutual aid is to summarize achievements and enhance the members' confidence in mutual assistance and mutual benefit. Second, village cadres must provide specific leadership, understanding the general situation in the village through personal inspection and visiting exemplary groups to resolve the masses' ideological problems, breaking the masses' mentality of wanting to rest early after planting, and arranging the time specifically. Third, with more people comes greater strength; mutual aid should be expanded, and efforts should be made to make the best use of everyone's talents without wasting labor. Mutual aid should be fair, with equal pay for equal work. In short, large-scale labor exchange should be promoted, with labor exchange between groups and throughout the village. The production committee should provide in-depth leadership, unified command, control labor use, and coordinate to solve difficulties. Fourth, the wheat planting area should be expanded by calculating the expected harvest. All arable land should be planted with wheat, aiming for 85% to 90% coverage. On dry land in the paper industry area, 20 to 25 dan of manure should be applied; on irrigated land, 40 to 50 dan. In non-paper industry areas, manure should be spread and raked in once, with intercropping; 30 dan on dry land and 60 dan on irrigated land. In terms of deep plowing and careful cultivation, the land should be harrowed four times, and land turning should be encouraged. A campaign of meritorious service should be launched. After the research, the district and village cadres went to the countryside to rectify mutual aid and promote the autumn harvest and wheat planting. (Zhidong, Yuancun)

    【本报潞城讯】四区黄碾，十一号黑夜召开全村八百余人群众大会，讨论种麦、整顿互助、准备秋收等工作。北街卫根喜说：“我组原有麦地九十三亩，因今年春旱麦子歉收，秋苗又受了旱、涝、风、雹等四灾，减收了十分之三，明年春天粮食不够吃，为了补助粮食的不足，今年全组扩大麦田九十亩，共一八三亩，现在正茬麦地肥料已经准备好，每亩平均上干粪四十五担，改茬麦地完全用圊粪，圊粪上改茬，保证顶住正茬”。在阴历八月十五前保证全部下完种，口号是能种就种，不等节令，改茬提前下，下年顶正茬。未割玉茭苗，串垄即栽下。中街张金江说：“我的组现在工资还未清理，我心很是不满，最近我就不想和他们到一块互助，经过今天黑夜小组讨论，明天一定把工资帐清理了，只要工资清理好，保证我小组在八月十五前能种完，因旱年秋需早，应赶快突击搞。”各组现在正在整顿互助组，订计划提前下种，争取正改茬一样收。在阴八月十五前保证种完，第二天南街朱富六组，一天已种麦十二亩。（宏太、书神、来存、中央、申习）
    【本报涉县讯】涉县七区，于十八日召开区村干部会议，讨论开展秋收种麦运动。根据全区半年来互助情况，指出要开展这一运动，首先要由上而下由下到上的进行检查，通过检查去看互助组织的建全否，和种籽农具的缺数，在检查总结中整顿互助。组织起来面窄的村，用组织起来与不组织的利益比较，把面窄村组织起来，整顿互助重点是总结成绩，提高组员的互助互利信心。其次村干要具体领导，自己经过检查了解村里一般情况，深入典型小组，解决群众思想问题，打破群众嫌种的早消停心理，把时间作具体按排。第三，人多力量大，要扩大互助，同时要做到人尽其才，不浪费劳力，互助要公道，折工等价。总之提倡大变工，组与组全村大变工，生产委员会要深入领导，统一指挥，掌握劳力使用，调剂解决困难。第四，种麦面积，要通过算年景，扩大麦田。一切能种的地都种上麦，要求种到百分之八十五到九十。上粪在纸业区旱地上到二十担到二十五担，水地上到四十担至五十担。非纸业区要洒一遍粪搂一遍，串种，旱地上到三十担，水地六十担。深耕细作上，地耙四遍，提倡翻地，开展立功竞赛。经研究后，区村干部即下乡整顿互助，推动秋收种麦。（之栋、元存）
