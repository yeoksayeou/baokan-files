Setting Policy Based on Mass Demands
Qiu County Increases Autumn Grain Production
[Our Correspondent Group, 23rd Dispatch] After being struck by the great famine of 1933, most villages in Qiu County have still not recovered. This year's wheat harvest was also poor due to drought. In the first half of the year, the County Committee promptly called on the entire county to launch an increase production campaign, proposing "taking agriculture as the main focus and carrying out sideline production to achieve the goal of increased production." However, the leadership was not very clear on how to proceed specifically. This joint meeting of branch secretaries specifically studied this issue and reached a consensus. Attendees, based on their experience in practical work, clearly proposed that "to increase production, we must develop sideline production with agriculture as the mainstay, and use sideline production to support agricultural production." Many villages were unable to add or raise draft cattle for the long term due to the lack of sideline production. However, liberated peasants in villages with sideline production, such as Nanliu Village, Lishengzhuang, and Xiangchenggu, largely solved this difficulty with sideline dividends. Qiu County has a severe shortage of fertilizer. Farmers produced some green manure and also bought some bean cake and cottonseed cake as fertilizer with sideline dividends. Many mutual aid groups and mutual aid teams opened oil mills and flour mills, which also accumulated a considerable amount of fertilizer. The mutual aid group in Nanliu Village relied on more than a dozen flour mills to accumulate more than 620 large carts of fertilizer in one month. According to incomplete statistics from three districts, the county has 16,841 mu of wasteland. Thus, the question of "deep plowing and careful cultivation?" or "expanding cultivated area?" became an urgent problem to be solved. The western part of Qiu County has more black soil. For example, after a rainfall of four fingers deep, it is wet in the morning, dry in the afternoon, and becomes extremely hard at night. This is one of the most difficult types of land to cultivate. Before the famine, each laborer in the west cultivated an average of 30 mu, and the entire family had to work during busy farming seasons, sometimes even needing to find help. Now, a full laborer cultivates an average of 50 to 60 mu, and a draft cattle cultivates an average of over 120 mu. They already feel overwhelmed without reclaiming wasteland. The eastern half mostly has sandy soil, which the masses call "trade land," which will not grow well without enough fertilizer. Today, the masses do not have the strength to apply a lot of fertilizer. Therefore, reclaiming wasteland to expand the cultivated area is not the most urgent demand of the masses. Generally, the masses today most hope to cultivate the existing land well. When the County Committee called for increasing production, it proposed hoeing the autumn seedlings one more time, which was universally done throughout the county. According to experienced farmers, "hoeing one more time can yield an extra five catties of grain." The county's 419,000 mu of autumn seedling land can yield an estimated increase of over 2 million catties of grain. Li Shumei of Lishengzhuang, due to timely cultivation and ample fertilizer application, saw her per-mu yield exceed the general harvest by two to three times this year. The above facts prove that we should "expand the cultivated area on the basis of cultivating the existing land well," and not forcibly expand the cultivated area, which would affect the cultivation of the existing land.

How exactly can the goal of increased production be achieved? The attendees unanimously believed that "organizing is the only good way to increase production." Poor peasants have only just turned over and have not fully caught their breath. They have more land than before (an average of five to six mu per person), and they face considerable difficulties in cultivation. They lack livestock, farm tools, and fertilizer. In the past, when they had less land, they could take time to do small business or carry a burden to earn a living. Today, they do not have that time in the fields. All of this shows that it is difficult for poor peasants to cultivate their land well if they are not organized. Middle peasants have more labor, but they cannot cultivate all of their land well if they are not organized. Therefore, they all have the demand to be organized, which also shows that only by "organizing" can we talk about increasing production. The mutual aid team led by Yonghua in Xiangchenggu has a total of 27 households, including 25 poor peasant households. In the first half of this year, they cultivated all the land of the team well and also engaged in sideline production with surplus labor, earning a dividend of 2.9 million yuan, with each household receiving more than 100,000 yuan, and they also added a head of livestock, supporting agricultural production.

    根据群众要求订出方针
    邱县秋粮增产
    【本报记者团二十三日电】邱县经过三十三年大灾荒的袭击，大部村庄直到现在仍未恢复元气，今年麦收又因天旱歉收，县委会于上半年，及时的号召全县展开增产运动，提出“以农业为主进行副业生产，达到增产的目的。”但是究竟怎样具体进行，领导思想上还不十分明确，这次分书联席会上，专门研究这个问题，获得一致的意见。到会者以个人在实际工作中的体验，明确的提出“要想增产，必须以农业为主的发展副业，而又以副业生产支援农业生产”。好多村庄因没有副业生产，不能添置与长期喂养耕牛，而有副业生产的南刘村、李省庄、香城固等村翻身农民，大部以副业红利解决了这个困难。邱县肥料奇缺，农民造了部份青肥，另以副业红利买了一部份豆饼、棉籽饼作肥料，许多互助组、互助大队开设油坊、粉坊，也积了相当数量的肥料。南刘村互助组即依靠十余座粉坊，一个月内积肥六百二十多大车。该县荒地，根据三个区不完全统计，达一万六千八百四十一亩，于是“深耕细作呢？”“扩大耕地面积呢？”就成了个亟待解决的问题。邱县西部多黑土地，譬如落了四指深的雨，早晨湿上午干，晚上就硬的不能硬了，这是一种最难种的土地，灾荒前，西部平均每个劳动力种三十亩，农忙还需全家下地，有时候并得找人帮助，现在一个整劳力平均种五、六十亩，一个耕牛平均合一百二十亩以上，不开荒地已经感觉种不过来了；东半就多沙地，群众称之为“买卖地”，上粪少了就长不好，今天群众尚没有力量上好多粪，因此开荒扩大耕地面积，还不是群众最迫切的要求，一般群众今天最希望的是，将现有的地种好。县委号召增加生产时，提出秋苗多锄一遍，全县都普遍的做到了。据有经验的农民谈：“多锄一遍能多收五斤粮食。”全县秋苗地四十一万九千余亩，约可增粮二百万斤以上。李省庄李书梅因耕种及时与上粪多，今年每亩产量超过一般收成二、三倍。以上事实证明应该“在做好现有土地的基础上，去扩大耕种面积”，而不能强行扩大耕种面积，影响把现有耕地种好。
    究竟怎样具体达到增产目的？到会者一致认为“组织起来是增产的唯一好办法。”贫农才翻身，还未完全喘过气来，土地比过去多了（每人平均合五、六亩），耕种上的困难也相当多；缺乏牲口农具及肥料，过去地少可抽出时间作小生意或担个担子，赚钱糊口，今天地里没有那些时间了。这一切都说明贫农如不组织起来，他们的土地很难种好，中农劳力较多，但不组织起来地也不能全部种好，因此都有组织起来的要求，也说明了只有“组织起来”才能谈得上增产。香城固在永华领导的互助大队，共二十七户，内有二十五户贫农，今年上半年把全大队的地种好，还以剩余劳力搞副业，赚红利二百九十万元，每户分到十几万元，又添置牲口一头，支援了农业生产。
