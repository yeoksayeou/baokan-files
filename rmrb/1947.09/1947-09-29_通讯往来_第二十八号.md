    Comrade Liu Yin of the Propaganda Department of the Jinnan Third Prefectural Committee:
    Please report to us on the current autumn harvest situation in each county of the Third Sub-district, and the achievements in overcoming disaster, poor harvests, and expanding wheat fields. We hope you can write a comprehensive introduction to the experience of how your region completed the autumn harvest early in conjunction with wheat planting, in order to promote the current harvest and cultivation movement.
    Xingtai Office:
    The report on the Xingtai Dasebi crop competition movement reflects your new creation in summarizing production and promoting mutual aid methods. Please continue to report on the crop competition movement, the development in new and old areas, and summarize the experience in this regard. According to your county's recent work deployment, we hope you will report continuously on the achievements of the old areas in summarizing production through crop competition and improving mutual aid to increase production, as well as the gains and experiences of the new areas in actively launching the elimination of wasteland, increasing production, and expanding wheat fields after calculating the annual harvest.
    Shahe County Office and Comrade Correspondents:
    It is very good that you have been able to seize the opportunity to mobilize the masses, compete in the autumn harvest, and uniformly organize labor in the autumn harvest and wheat planting, and rely on one district and one village to conduct continuous reporting in a timely manner. Please continue to report on the achievements of these districts and villages in summarizing the autumn harvest and entering the wheat planting season to expand wheat planting, as well as the experience of improving mutual aid in autumn cultivation. We also hope to receive a comprehensive report on the achievements and systematic experience of the county's autumn harvest and wheat planting organization in assisting labor.
