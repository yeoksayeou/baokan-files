　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 27th: Cairo dispatch: American influence has recently rapidly extended to Egypt, attempting to replace Britain's position in Egypt. U.S. loans to Egypt have reached the final stage. The Egyptian army has ordered a large number of U.S. equipment, and, contrary to the past practice of employing British advisors, has unprecedentedly employed American advisors. The Egyptian delegation is currently in Washington conducting important negotiations with the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff. The U.S. Embassy in Cairo has recently been authorized to establish a radio station in Egypt and publish propaganda publications. Egyptian Prime Minister Nokrashy has publicly stated that after the British withdrawal, the Egyptian army will be under the command of American experts; and former Prime Minister Sidky even suggested extending the American oil pipeline in Arabia to Egyptian ports. In order to further compel the complete withdrawal of British forces from Egypt, at the instigation of the United States, and under pressure from the masses led by the Wafd Party domestically, Egyptian Prime Minister Nokrashy filed a complaint against Britain to the Security Council at the beginning of this month, demanding that British troops immediately withdraw from the Nile River basin, Sudan, and other parts of Egypt, and terminate its rule in Sudan. According to the London "Middle East News Letter" on the 20th, Nokrashy's demand to stage an anti-British drama "precisely caters to the interests of the United States, and further increases the United States' influence on all aspects of Egyptian life, which will sacrifice Britain." At the same time, the United States really does not want the Security Council to directly handle the matter, so it instructed Brazil at the Security Council to suggest "resuming British-Egyptian negotiations without the Security Council taking direct action." The United States has also formally suggested that the United States come forward to "mediate the British-Egyptian dispute." The Cairo Al-Ahram newspaper commented on the 24th: "This mediation is a cunning attempt to exert influence and pressure."
　　
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 27th: Rome dispatch: According to the "Unità" newspaper, Italian Foreign Minister Sforza and Greek Foreign Minister Tsaldaris met on the 19th, which was "a prelude to establishing closer relations between Italy, Greece, and Turkey and forming a Mediterranean group dominated by the United States." The London News Chronicle revealed that the Italian-Greek talks were held at the suggestion of Marshall. Athens is now rumored to be organizing an "Italy-Greece-Turkey group." This move is closely related to the Truman Assistance Program. The newspaper also stated that the U.S. State Department is attempting to include Iran and Arab countries in this group as well. This move shows that the expansion of U.S. imperialism has greatly penetrated into areas that have always been within Britain's sphere of influence.

　　美国排挤英国独霸中东
  　利用贷款控制埃及
    策动意希土成立“地中海集团”
    【新华社陕北二十七日电】开罗讯：美国势力近向埃及迅速伸展，力图取英国在埃地位而代之。美国对埃贷款已进行至最后阶段，埃及陆军已订购大批美国装备，并一反过去任用英国顾问之习惯而破天荒任用美国顾问。埃政府所派出之使团刻正在华盛顿与美参谋总部进行重要谈判。美驻开罗大使馆近已获准在埃建立无线电台，并发行宣传刊物。埃总理诺克拉希曾公开宣称，在英国撤出后，埃军将受美国专家的指挥；而前总理席德基甚至建议伸展美国在阿拉伯之油管至埃及港口。为了进一步压迫英国势力完全撤出埃及，在美国嗾使下，埃总理诺克拉希并慑于国内由莘夫脱党所领导的群众压力，已于本月初向安理会提出对英国之控诉，要求英军立即从尼罗河流域、苏丹及埃及其他各地撤退，并终止在苏丹之统治。据伦敦“中东新闻信”二十日揭露：诺克拉希大演反英戏的要求，“恰迎合于美国的利益，更增长美国对埃及生活各方面的影响，这种增长势将牺牲英国。”同时，美国实在不愿安理会直接处理此事，故又指使巴西在安理会建议，要求“恢复英埃谈判，而无须安理会出诸直接行动。”美国并正式建议由美出面“调停英埃纠纷”。二十四日开罗亚尔巴拉报对此评称：“这一调停是施以影响与压力的狡猾企图。”
    【新华社陕北二十七日电】罗马讯：据“团结报”载息，意外长史佛卓与希外长曹达利斯曾于十九日会谈，此为“建立意大利、希腊与土耳其间更密切关系和成立美国独霸地中海集团的前奏”。伦敦新闻纪事报透露，意希会谈是在马歇尔提议下举行的。雅典现正风传组织“意大利——希腊——土耳其集团”的动议。这一动议与杜鲁门援助计划有密切的关系。该报并称，美国务院企图将伊朗与阿拉伯国家亦包括在此集团之内。此举显示，美帝国主义的扩张已大大深入至一向是英国势力范围的区域了。
