    Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 26th: Late news: Model reporter Song Dake of the East China Front reported (posthumous manuscript) the heroic deeds of thirteen heroes of the People's Liberation Army who persisted in the Wang Laohu front line position in the Yun(cheng) South Blockade Battle, fiercely attacked the stubborn enemy, and won the victory, stating: On September 4th, when the battle began, the crack main force of Chiang Kai-shek's Fifth Army and Two Hundredth Division, equipped entirely with American weapons, concentrated dozens of large and small cannons to bombard the People's Liberation Army's positions. For a time, the peach forest in front of the position was filled with shrapnel. As soon as the artillery fire stopped, an enemy force three times our size rushed towards the peach forest. At this critical moment, thirteen heroes, including first-class combat hero Wei Quanyou and special-class meritorious service member Wen Yong, immediately jumped out of their positions, stood tall on the wall, and repelled four fierce enemy assaults in a row, inspiring everyone's determination to hold the position. Among them, combat models Liu Peihe, Cui Xitai, and Wan Yingen resisted an enemy company, preventing the enemy from advancing a single step. When the enemy's main force fiercely attacked the Wuxiaodongmen position, Wei Quanyou, Qi Wenyong, Zhang Yongquan, and others bravely jumped onto the wall amidst the artillery fire and fiercely swept the enemy with automatic weapons. At the most critical moment, Wei Quanyou threw grenades while loudly calling on the heroes: "As long as we are here, the enemy will not get in!" All the heroes were full of confidence, throwing grenades one after another. Chen Youfu persistently defended the southeast gate with a Canadian-style rifle; machine gunner Zhang Guode single-handedly annihilated more than twenty enemies. Due to the tenacious resistance of the thirteen heroes, the four assaults of the enemy's two battalions were all defeated with injuries, and our army's position stood firm, thus determining the victory of the entire blockade battle.

    郓南阻击战中的十三英雄
    宋大可同志遗稿
    【新华社华东前线二十六日电】迟到消息：华东前线模范记者宋大可报导（遗稿）解放军十三位英雄在郓（城）南阻击战中坚持王老虎一线阵地痛击顽敌、赢得胜利的英勇事迹称：九月四日当战斗开始时，全美械装备的蒋匪精锐主力第五军第二百师以数十门大小炮集中向解放军阵地轰击，一时阵地前沿桃树林为弹片砍落满地。炮声刚停，三倍于我之敌已扑至桃林。当此紧急关头，甲等战斗英雄魏全友，特等功臣文勇等十三位英雄，即首先跃出阵地，雄踞围墙上，一连打退敌人四次凶猛冲锋，鼓舞了大家坚守阵地决心。其中战模刘培合、崔西泰、万银根三人抗击敌人一个连，使敌未能前进一步。当敌主力猛扑戊小东门阵地时，魏全友、齐文勇、张勇全等在炮火中奋身跳上围墙，以自动火器猛扫敌人。魏全友于最紧张时，一面猛掷手榴弹，一面大声号召英雄们：“只要我们在，敌人进不来！”各英雄皆信心百倍，把手榴弹一排排地扔出去。陈友福以一支加拿大式始终坚守东南门；机枪手张果得一个人歼敌二十余名。由于十三位英雄的顽强抗击，使敌人两个营的四次冲锋均负伤败退，我军阵地屹立未动，因而决定了整个阻击战斗的胜利。
