　　Taihang Implements New Treatment Methods
  　Injured Soldiers Quickly Return to Ranks
    [This newspaper's Taihang dispatch on the 27th] Since the No. 1 clinic of the Taihang Fourth Military Subdistrict Health Department implemented new treatment methods, the number of injured soldiers returning to their units has surged. After the Daoging railway line battle in northern Henan in July, within five weeks, the number of injured soldiers who were cured and discharged from the hospital and returned to the front lines accounted for half of all injured soldiers. The remaining half is expected to be discharged from the hospital by mid-September. The reasons for such rapid recovery of the wounded are mainly: 1. Strict disinfection. Disinfection is thorough. Instruments for changing dressings, gauze strips, bandages, and cover cloths are all steamed and disinfected for six hours. Each forceps is used for only one wound and then disinfected with alcohol. 2. Change dressings less frequently. Avoid stimulating new muscles to allow them to grow quickly. Among the soldiers discharged this time, the most frequent changes were seven times, once every five days, and the least frequent changes were three times, once every ten days, and they were all cured. Comrade You Ji, a fighter from the 20th unit, had a severe arm injury, but he was cured after only four dressing changes. When he was discharged from the hospital and returned to his unit, he happily said to the director, "The new treatment is really good. During the great counter-offensive two years ago, my leg was broken by artillery fire. I had dressings changed every day and stayed in the hospital for three whole months before I was discharged. This time the injury was even more serious, but it was completely healed in less than half a month.” The treatment of bone fractures has also been very effective since the adoption of plaster bandages. The surgical method of surgery has also been greatly reduced, allowing the fragmented bones and muscles of many injured soldiers to grow together, greatly reducing the rate of disability. Two percent of the personnel who recovered and returned to the team this time were disabled. Now all the medical staff in the clinic are working day and night to carefully research and strive to further reduce the mortality and disability rates of the wounded in the Great Counteroffensive and quickly return to the team to ensure the victory of the front line.

　　太行实施新疗法
  　伤员迅速归队
    【本报太行二十七日电】太行四分区卫生处一所，实施新疗法以来，伤员归队数激增。七月豫北道清线战役后，五个星期内，治愈出院重返前线的伤员，即占全部伤员的半数，其余一半，预计在九月中旬，当可全部出院。伤员能如此迅速痊愈原因主要是：一、消毒严密、换药用具、纱条、绷带、盖口布等，均经六小时蒸溜消毒，每把摄子，只换一个伤口，即用酒精消毒。二、少换药，不使新生肌肉受刺激，使其得有迅速生长机会。这次出院的伤员中，最多的换七次，每五天换一次，最少者换三次，每十天换一次，即全部治愈。二○部战士游吉同志，胳膊炸伤很重，仅换药四次，即已治愈。他出院归队时，高兴的向所长说：“新疗法就是好，前年大反攻时，我腿上被炮弹创破些皮，天天换药，整整住了三个月才出院，这次伤又重，还不到半个月就好光了。”骨折伤的治疗法，自采用石膏绷带法，收效亦很大，施行医疗手术上的开刀法，亦大为减少，使许多伤员伤处碎骨和肌肉长在一起，大大减少了残废率，这次伤愈归队的人员中，就有百分之二残废。现全所医务人员，正日以继夜悉心研究，争取在大反攻中，更多减少伤员的死亡和残废率，并迅速归队来保证前线的胜利。
