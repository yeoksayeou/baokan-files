　　Military University Political Department Directive
  　Entire School to Participate in Harvest Assistance
    [This newspaper's report] The masses in the area where the Military University is located have entered the autumn harvest, and after the autumn harvest, the re-examination movement will begin. In order to assist the masses in quickly completing the autumn harvest and launching the re-examination, the Political Department of the Military University issued a directive to all units of the school on August 30th, instructing them to devote a certain amount of time, amidst the intense graduation work, to helping the masses with the autumn harvest. The time allocation stipulates: graduating students one day, non-graduating students two days, and office cadres and staff can increase the number of days appropriately based on the situation of their unit. The directive specifies the following points for attention: (1) Coordinate with local cadres to conduct thorough investigation and understanding work, and allocate and adjust labor power in an organized and planned manner, without wasting manpower and animal power, and in particular, organize all labor power in the village with our help. (2) The main targets of assistance should be revolutionary martyrs, military personnel, and families of workers without labor power, as well as elderly, weak, orphaned, and widowed peasants who have been emancipated. No assistance should be given to landlords. (3) Cherish the masses' farm tools and crops, and do not accept any remuneration from the masses. (4) Pay attention to publicizing to the masses and collecting their feedback. The focus of publicity is: the victory of the year of patriotic self-defense war, the crimes of Chiang and the US, continuing to eliminate feudalism, eliminate landlords, increase production and practice thrift, and support the front lines. After receiving the directive, all units have carried out in-depth mobilization, ensuring thorough implementation, and some units have selected dates and are preparing to start taking action immediately.
