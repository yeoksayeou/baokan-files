    Yuebei First Special District Directs All Localities to Grasp Autumn Harvest, Autumn Planting, and Autumn Plowing
    [This Dispatch from Taiyue, 25th] In the situation of a large number of laborers supporting the front, in order to do a good job in the upcoming autumn harvest, autumn planting, and autumn plowing, the Yuebei First Special District Office specifically instructs leaders at all levels to pay attention to the following five points: 1. Leaders at all levels should recognize the importance of the autumn harvest, autumn planting, and autumn plowing period, and must take urgent action, constantly supervise and inspect, and meticulously organize. They must also educate the masses that problems can only be solved through organization. Wheat fields must be plowed three times, harrowed once, and have sufficient fertilizer applied, striving to complete planting around the Autumn Equinox. The autumn harvest should be a tense, concentrated effort to shorten harvesting time. Autumn plowing should guarantee one plowing, with autumn harvesting and autumn plowing being carried out simultaneously, correcting the old habit of plowing only after the autumn harvest is completed. 2. We must strictly organize and appropriately adjust animal power, appropriately resolve the wages for plowing cattle. In the three tasks of autumn harvest, autumn planting, and autumn plowing, animal power should be squeezed out as much as possible for planting wheat and plowing the land. Under mutually beneficial conditions, resolve the issue of making and raising cattle. 3. Combine the rectification of mutual aid teams with the extensive expansion of labor organization, assigning clear divisions of labor to all full and semi-laborers in a planned way. Women and semi-laborers can be used extensively in all three tasks of autumn harvest, autumn planting, and plowing the land. During this period, women's spinning should be temporarily suspended, and they should vigorously participate in this work. Children in elementary schools should also be organized to participate in wheat planting and autumn harvesting. 4. Under such an organization, the production of resistance soldiers, war support laborers, militiamen, and cadres must be done well, with work points recorded accurately, to be settled when they return. 5. In border areas, a high degree of vigilance should be maintained to strictly prevent Yan Xishan's troops from seizing grain. Implement a combination of labor and military affairs to protect the autumn harvest, planting of wheat, and plowing of autumn land.
