    Xiang Tishui Takes the Lead in Unburdening Himself
    Promoting Village-Wide Financial Rectification
    [This newspaper, Huguan dispatch] At the Third District cadres' meeting, the District Committee called for the rectification of village finances. Xiang Tishui, the Party Branch Secretary of Shili Village, believed that rectifying village finances was a very important task, but he himself still had two public items at home. After returning home from the meeting, he felt as if he was carrying a heavy burden all the way. After returning to the village, he first convened a branch committee meeting to discuss how to rectify village finances, and raised the question of whether the cadres themselves also had burdens. For a long time, no one dared to speak. Xiang Tishui said, "I do have something I am sorry about to the masses. I still have a public single-strip cloth bag at home. I must take it out, otherwise it will always be a burden, and I won't feel comfortable." After he spoke, other branch committee members also said, "I have also been uneasy, and wanted to say something but was shy." After discussing this at the Party member meeting, it encouraged the Party members to also talk about many things. On August 30th, a village-wide mass meeting was held. Xiang Tishui first reported and put down his burden and washed his face. Then, the Party members took the lead in reporting all public property, which influenced the villagers to voluntarily report public property. The emancipated peasant Xiang Laixing jumped up and said, "Xiang Tishui! You really deserve to be called a model. If it were the old Zhongxiao (landlord) in the past, we wouldn't even dare to carry things for them. Today you can say things that others don't know, I really admire you." The whole village rectified property worth more than forty piculs of millet, and the relationship between the Party and the masses became even closer.

    向提水自放包袱
    推动全村整理财政
    【本报壶关讯】三区干部会上区委号召整顿村财政，十里村支书向提水认为整理村财政是个很重要的工作，可是自己家中还有两件公物。会后返家时，一路上觉着自己好象背了一个很重的包袱。回村后他首先召开了支委会议，讨论如何整理村财政，并提出咱们干部是否也有包袱？好久没人敢说、向提水说：“我可有一件对不起群众的事，我家里还用着公共的一条单一条布袋，我要拿出来，不然终久是包袱，心里不痛快。”经他一谈，其他支委也说：我也一直不放心，又想说又害羞。这样在党员大会上谈了后，推动了党员也谈出好多东西。八月三十号召开全村群众大会，向提水先报了，放下包袱洗了脸，接着党员带头将所有公物报出后，影响了全村群众纷纷自报公物，翻身农民向来兴跳起来说：“向提水！你真称得起模范，要是过去的老忠孝（地主），咱给人家提提也不敢，今天你能把别人不知道的东西说出来，我真赞成你”。全村共整出价值四十余石小米的财物，且使党与群众的关系更加密切了。
