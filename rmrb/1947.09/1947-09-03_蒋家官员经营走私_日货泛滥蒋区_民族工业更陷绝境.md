  　民族工业更陷绝境
    【新华社陕北三十一日电】据塔斯社上海二十九日电引新民报报导，大规模日货近从美国控制下的朝鲜南部及日本源源私运入中国（蒋管区），情况异常严重。另据路透社同日沪电称：大量日货正倾销于天津，而且当做美货出卖；标有“美国制造”的日本玩具与毛织品，正以最低的价格出卖。按据各方消息证实，经营走私者主要为蒋家官员，在美货日货大量倾销及大规模走私的情况下，民族工商业已陷绝境。
    【新华社陕北三十一日电】蒋管区由于外汇新条例所引起的物价涨风，现仍在各地继续发展。据美联社及合众社报导：一月余未曾变动的上海黑市外汇价格，廿八日突作螺旋上升。黑市货币商喊价美金一元合法币四万八千元，较前此四万元左右上升了百分之二十。与美钞上涨相呼应各地进出口货亦均继续上涨。上海每担大米已自四十万元突涨至四十八万元，一日之间亦上升百分之二十。又据中央社二十八日消息，南京“中国”“中央”两空航公司已向蒋政府交通部呈请，自二十九日起各线客货运价一律增加百分之百。出口货世界闻名的杭州茶叶，市场价格亦骤涨不已，且形成有行无市现象。众信各地物价还要继续上涨。
