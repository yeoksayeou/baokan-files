　　Remarkable Victories in Our Region Since July
  　3,500 Enemy Officers Captured
  　Two Brigade Commanders of the Same Unit Captured Three Times
    [Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] Military Region Political Department News: Since our army crossed the Yellow River to the south in July, four enemy reorganized divisions, totaling nine and a half brigades, were annihilated in July alone, with a huge number of captures. If we include the enemy annihilated and captured in the Taihang and Taiyue regions, a total of more than 3,500 enemy officers of general, colonel, and lieutenant ranks were captured.
    According to incomplete statistics, the enemy generals captured include: Lieutenant General Chen Yiding, commander of the Reorganized 70th Division; Major General Luo Zhedong, deputy commander; Major General Xie Qinghua, brigade commander of the 140th Brigade of the Reorganized 70th Division; Lieutenant General Li Mingya, deputy commander of the Reorganized 55th Division; Lieutenant General Song Ruike, commander of the Reorganized 66th Division; Major General Guo Yulin, chief of staff; Major General Tu Huantao, brigade commander of the 185th Brigade of the Reorganized 66th Division; Major General Wang Shiqiao, brigade commander of the 199th Brigade; and Major General Zhang Honghui, head of the Henan Northern Henan special service (nominally the magistrate of Bo'ai County). The above includes three lieutenant generals and six major generals, totaling nine.
    The enemy field-grade officers captured include: Colonel Xu Hongcheng, chief of staff of the 141st Brigade of the Reorganized 32nd Division; Colonel Wang Runpu, chief of staff of the 149th Brigade; Colonel Bi Guanyi, director of the 29th Brigade of the Reorganized 55th Division; Colonel Chen Zhijing, director of the news office of the Reorganized 70th Division; Colonel Liu Xueji, chief of staff of the 139th Brigade of the Reorganized 70th Division; Colonel Luo Shishen, commander of the 279th Regiment of the 140th Brigade; Colonel Wang Jianquan, commander of the 457th Regiment of the 153rd Brigade of the Reorganized 63rd Division; Colonel Zeng Boqun, commander of the 459th Regiment of the 153rd Brigade; Colonel Wang Kaishi, deputy chief of staff of the Reorganized 66th Division; Colonel Wang Shijie, director of the military affairs office; Colonel Luo Zhen, director of the news office; Colonel Pang Shuping, chief of staff of the ×× Brigade of the Reorganized 66th Division; Colonel Li Zhuquan, commander of the 37th Regiment of the 13th Brigade; Colonel Zheng Wenyi, commander of the 38th Regiment of the 13th Brigade; Colonel Ma Jia, chief of staff of the 185th Brigade; Colonel Luo Yuteng, commander of the 553rd Regiment of the 185th Brigade; Colonel Li Chisheng, commander of the 555th Regiment of the 185th Brigade; Colonel Ke Zhu, deputy brigade commander of the 199th Brigade; Colonel Yang Runsheng, battalion commander of the 16th Engineer Regiment of the Ministry of National Defense; and Wang Dingchen, air force major pilot. The above includes 19 colonels and one air force major; including 366 lieutenant colonels, majors, and lieutenants.
    A total of more than 3,100 enemy company-grade officers were captured.
    Due to our army's victorious annihilation battles, some enemy units have been annihilated twice after being replenished after the first annihilation, and quite a few field-grade and company-grade officers have been captured twice. Among senior generals, for example, Xie Maoquan, the brigade commander of the 140th Brigade of the Reorganized 70th Division, was captured in the Jinyu Campaign in January this spring; in July this year, when the Reorganized 70th Division was completely annihilated, Xie Qinghua, the brigade commander of the 140th Brigade (a close confidant of Chen Cheng, sent after Xie Maoquan was captured), was again captured in Dawangzhuang on July 14; only half a year apart. Xie Qinghua was once captured in the Lunan Campaign this spring, but was released under our army's lenient policy due to disguise and concealment. This capture is the second time.
    Under the iron fist of the People's Liberation Army, the fact that the same unit has been annihilated twice (such as the 140th Brigade), and two brigade commanders have been captured three times (although Xie Qinghua may not have been a brigade commander when he was first captured), this fact should serve as a serious lesson to the senior generals of the Chiang army: Whoever conducts the anti-people civil war cannot escape being captured or annihilated; and if they do not quickly withdraw from the civil war, there will be a second and third time!

　　七月份以来我区战果辉煌
  　俘敌军官三千五百
  　同一番号两个旅长三次被俘
    【本报特讯】军区政治部消息：自七月我大军南渡黄河以来，七月一个月中歼敌四个整编师，计九个半旅，俘获极多。若连太行太岳歼敌俘获统计，共俘敌将校尉级军官佐达三千五百余名。
    据不完全的统计，俘敌将官：整七○师中将师长陈颐鼎，少将副师长罗哲东；整七○师一四○旅少将旅长谢清华；整五五师中将副师长理明亚；整六六师中将师长宋瑞珂，少将参谋长郭雨林；整六六师一八五旅少将旅长涂焕陶，一九九旅少将旅长王士翘；豫北特务头子（名义为博爱县长）少将张宏惠。以上中将三名，少将六名，共九名。
    俘敌校级军官：整三二师一四一旅上校参谋长徐鸿成，一四九旅上校参谋长王润圃；整五五师二九旅上校参谋主任毕贯一；整七○师新闻处上校处长陈止敬；整七○师一三九旅上校参谋主任刘学基，一四○旅二七九团上校团长罗时审；整六三师一五三旅四五七团上校团长王鉴泉，一五三旅四五九团上校团长曾博群；整六六师上校副参谋长王开石，军务处上校处长王时洁，新闻处上校处长罗桢；整六六师××旅上校参谋长庞淑平，十三旅三七团上校团长李竹泉，十三旅三八团上校团长郑文颐，一八五旅上校参谋长马甲之，一八五旅五五三团上校团长罗玉滕，一八五旅五五五团上校团长李炽生，一九九旅上校副旅长柯竹；国防部工兵第十六团上校营长杨润生；空军少校驾驶员王鼎臣。以上上校十九名，空军少校一名；连中校少校军官佐共计三百六十六名。
    俘敌尉级军官共计三千一百余名。
    由于我军胜利大歼灭战，致敌军部队有第一次被歼后补充二次又被歼灭者，校尉级军官二次被俘者已发现出不少。高级将领中如整七○师一四○旅长，今春一月金鱼战役中谢懋权被俘；今年七月整七○师全歼中，一四○旅旅长谢清华（是陈诚亲信，谢懋权被俘后派去者）又于七月十四日被俘于大王庄；前后相距仅只半年时间。谢清华今春在鲁南会战中曾一度被俘，被俘后由于伪装隐蔽，在我军宽大政策下侥幸被释，此次被俘是第二次。
    在人民解放军的铁拳下，所出现的同一番号两次被歼（如一四○旅），两个旅长被俘过三次（虽谢清华第一次被俘时不一定是旅长），这一事实，蒋军高级将领应作为严重教训：谁进行反人民的内战，被俘被歼是逃不脱的；而且如果不赶快退出内战的话，还有第二次第三次！（花淳）
