    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th: According to Tianjin newspapers: Guo Moruo, a prominent leader in China's cultural circles, and his family are struggling to survive in Shanghai due to soaring prices.

It is generally recognized that Mr. Guo is a literary giant of his generation, revered worldwide.

　　蒋介石迫害文化界
  　郭沫若氏卖字谋生
    【新华社陕北三十日电】据津报讯：我国文化界著名领袖郭沫若全家困居上海，在物价高涨下无以聊生，近由友人建议卖字维持家用。分对联、扇面、招牌等，润格自三万元至二十四万元不等。一般咸认郭先生一代文豪，举世共仰，目前竟被迫鬻字维生，足见蒋介石统治下上海文化界生活的艰窘。
    【新华社陕北三十日电】美联社南京二十八日讯：南京报纸十二家今晨未能出版，原因为印刷工人于资方拒绝关于增加工资百分之八十，并提高九月份底薪之要求后举行罢工。
