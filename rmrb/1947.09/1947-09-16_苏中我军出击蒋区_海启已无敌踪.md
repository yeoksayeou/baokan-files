　　Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 14th: A reporter from the Suzhong Branch summarized the glorious victory of the Suzhong local regiments' large-scale attack on the Chiang-occupied areas in August, stating: The great victory of the Ye Ting City Campaign in Northern Jiangsu (August 7th to 12th) forced the Chiang bandits to temporarily halt their "encirclement and suppression" of Suzhong. Our local regiments in various districts took the opportunity to launch widespread attacks on the adjacent Chiang-occupied areas, eliminate local Chiang armed forces, and recover large swaths of lost territory. The local armed forces of the Ninth District (Tongzhou, Rudong, Haimen, and Qidong areas), starting from the 13th, fiercely swept the Haimen-Qidong highway, capturing more than ten strongholds including Jiulong, Yuelai, and the Second Factory. More than 800 Chiang bandits fled to Sanyang and Xingang upon hearing the news, attempting to prolong their lives. Our local armed forces took advantage of the victory and pursued, annihilating them in one fell swoop at a cost ratio of twenty-five to one in terms of enemy and our losses. Chiang bandits in the remaining strongholds fled in panic, so that within a hundred miles of the current Haimen-Qidong county borders, there was no trace of the enemy. The local armed forces south of the Haimen-Taizhou line advanced simultaneously from the east and west; one route pointed towards Taixing, capturing the central stronghold of Xuanjiabao, a major town occupied by the Chiang bandits for more than a year, and more than twenty surrounding strongholds on the 15th. Our forces then attacked the Taixing-Huangqiao, Rugao-Huangqiao, and Haian-Taizhou communication lines, once even entering the important town of Jiangyan. By this point, the vast people in this area of more than three thousand square miles had regained their liberation. Another route crossed the east side of the Rugao-Xingang highway, which had been controlled by the Chiang puppets for nine months, capturing eight strongholds including Chemahu and Lijiabao. The local armed forces of the Second District (Xingbei, Qintong, and Gaoyou areas) launched an offensive directly under the city of Dongtai, entering Xipu Town, only about one kilometer west of the city, on the 17th. In total, in August, Suzhong eliminated seventy Chiang bandit strongholds, annihilated and captured 2,335 Chiang bandits, seized eighty-four light and heavy machine guns, 1,150 rifles and short guns, and a large amount of ammunition and military supplies.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 14th: A certain commander of the Suzhong Ninth District (under the jurisdiction of Nantong, Rudong, Haimen, and Qidong counties) recently spoke to reporters about the significance of the local armed forces' victory in capturing important places such as Sanyang and Xingang in late August, annihilating more than 800 Chiang puppets, pointing out four points: (1) Since we annihilated more than 500 enemies in Lingdiangang on May 30th, the Chiang bandits hurriedly transferred the 306th and 314th Regiments to strengthen the defense of Haimen and Qidong, and established the Tongzhou, Rudong, Haimen, and Qidong "encirclement and suppression" headquarters, with Qiao Wenli, commander of the 79th Brigade of the 49th Division, serving as commander. They occupied Sijiaba and used the 235th Regiment under this brigade to conduct "key encirclement and suppression" of Haimen and Qidong. Under the resistance of our army and people, they did not succeed. By the middle of August, after the great victory in Ye Ting City, the 235th Regiment fled north in panic, and the soldiers and civilians of Haimen and Qidong took the opportunity to counterattack, successively recovering many important towns such as Jiulong, the Second Factory, Sanyang, and Xingang, so that there was no trace of the enemy within a hundred miles, making the Chiang puppets' "encirclement and suppression" conspiracy during this period completely bankrupt. (2) Sanyang Town is an important town in eastern Haimen, with solid fortifications, and the enemy was confident that it could hold it, but it was captured by us in one fell swoop. This proves that not only is the Chiang puppets' "encirclement and suppression" ineffective, but even if they want to carry out "key defense," it is not easy to achieve, "making the Chiang puppet army's morale unprecedentedly shaken." (3) The local Chiang bandits entrenched in Sanyang and Xingang were the most hated reactionary armed forces of the people. For example, Lu Fengshan, the district chief of the Fourth District of Haimen, had slaughtered more than 400 patriotic people. This time, they were wiped out in one fell swoop, eliminating a great scourge for the people, laying a favorable foundation for the rapid resumption of work and long-term persistence in the future. (4) Although the enemy's fortifications were extremely strong, our army only resolved the battle after a short period of attack, and the ratio of enemy to our losses was twenty-five to one, marking the increasing improvement of the local armed forces' combat effectiveness.

　　苏中我军出击蒋区
  　海启已无敌踪
    【新华社华中十四日电】苏中分社记者综述八月份苏中地方兵团向蒋占区大举出击获得辉煌胜利称：苏北叶挺城战役大捷（八月七日至十二日），迫使蒋匪暂时停止对苏中之“清剿”，我各分区地方兵团乃乘机向邻近各蒋占区展开广泛出击，铲除土蒋武装，收复大块失地。九分区（通、如、海、启地区）地方武装，从十三日开始，猛烈扫荡海（门）启（东）公路，连拔久隆、悦来、二厂等十余据点，蒋匪八百余人闻风逃至三阳、新港，企图苟延残喘。我地武复乘胜追击，以敌我损失二十五比一之代价，将其一举聚歼。其余据点蒋匪惊惶逃窜到现海（门）启（东）县境纵横百里，无一敌踪。海（门）泰（州）线南地方武装东西两矛头同时并进；一路指向泰兴，于十五日攻克被占年余之蒋匪中心据点宣家堡重镇及其周围二十余据点。我复乘出击泰（兴）黄（桥）、如（皋）黄（桥）及海（安）泰（州）等交通线，一度攻入姜堰重镇。至此，该地区三千余方里内之广大人民，乃重获解放。另一路跨越被蒋伪控制达九个月之如（皋）新（港）公路东侧，连下车马湖、李家桥等八据点。二分区（兴北、溱潼、高邮地区）地武攻势直达东台城下，十七日攻入该城西仅约一公里之西濮镇。总计八月份苏中共拔除蒋匪据点七十处，歼俘蒋匪二千三百三十五名，缴轻重机枪八十四挺，长短枪一千一百五十支，及大批弹药与军用品。
    【新华社华中十四日电】苏中九分区（辖南通、如东、海门、启东四县）某司令顷对记者畅谈该区地武于八月下旬连克三阳、新港等要地，歼蒋伪八百余人之胜利意义，指出四点：（一）自五月卅日我于灵甸港歼敌五百余后，蒋匪忙调来三○六、三一四两团加强海启防务，并成立通、如、海、启“清剿”指挥部，以四十九师七十九旅旅长乔文礼充当指挥官，盘踞四甲坝以该旅所属二三五团对海启作“重点清剿”，在我军民奋起抵抗下，迄未得逞。至八月中叶挺城大捷，二三五团仓惶北调，海启军民乃乘机反击，先后光复久隆、二厂、三阳、新港等重镇多处，纵横百余里内无敌踪，使蒋伪这一时期之“清剿”阴谋，全部破产。（二）三阳镇为海门东部重镇，工事坚固，敌自信可以固守，但为我一举攻克。证明蒋伪不但“清剿”无效，即欲作“重点防御”，亦不易得，“使蒋伪军心，空前动摇。（三）盘踞三阳、新港之土蒋，为人民最痛恨之反动武装。如蒋匪海门四区区长陆凤山即曾屠杀爱国人民四百余。此次将其一网打尽，为人民除了大害，对迅速进行恢复工作及今后长期坚持，打下有利基础。（四）敌工事虽极坚固，但我军只经短时间攻击，即解决战斗，且敌我损失比例为二十五比一，标志着地方武装战斗力之日益提高。
