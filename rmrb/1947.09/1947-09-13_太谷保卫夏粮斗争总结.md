　　Summary of the Taigu Wheat Harvest Protection Struggle
    Taigu County Command  Compiled by this newspaper's archives

    Taigu has always been the area where the struggle to protect grain on the border of the Second Sub-district of Taihang is most intense. Before this year's wheat harvest, the dying Yan Xishan regime, in order to prolong its miserable existence, formulated a grain-grabbing plan that even they themselves found hard to believe, attempting to plunder 125,645 *shi* of wheat from the entire county (including the west of the road) – in fact, the total wheat produced in the county was no more than two-fifths of this amount. To carry out this plan, the enemy painstakingly made various preparations. With Yang Cheng, commander of Yan's puppet 9th Column, and the stubborn county head as leaders, they formed a huge and complex so-called "Grain Protection Committee," using the puppet 9th Column as the backbone, combined with the local armed "Security Police Brigade" and the "Revenge Struggle Group" composed of counter-revolutionaries as auxiliaries, to carry out armed plunder. However, under the firm determination of the party, government, army, and people of Taigu County to "protect and defend the victory grain," in just over half a month, 100,000 mu of wheat fields were all harvested. Yan's puppets paid the price of hundreds of people (together with the sub-district troops, about 700 enemies were killed, wounded, or captured in the summer grain struggle), and grabbed – including what the fleeing landlords transported – 2,948 *shi* of wheat.
    
    Solving Problems by Unifying Thinking

    Before the summer harvest, in light of the development of the overall situation of the enemy-us struggle this year, extensive ideological mobilization was carried out among cadres, soldiers, militiamen, and the masses, and the importance and seriousness of this year's grain protection struggle were fully estimated and analyzed. Protecting the wheat harvest was recognized as a strategic task to defeat the enemy, breaking the idea among the masses that each household should only harvest their own wheat and sweep the snow from their own doorsteps. In addition to ideological education, the main thing was to organize activists to take the lead. In areas bordering the enemy, the government would organize support forces to rush the harvest, and then distribute the grain to the households that had been allocated land. At that time, because the wheat harvest was poor and wages were too high, only the wage for harvesting one *mu* was proposed during the rush harvest, and the question of how to thresh, transport, and store was not resolved. As a result, the supporters only cared about harvesting, and those being supported were afraid of losing out if they harvested without being able to thresh, transport, and store the grain at the same time, so they were unwilling to let others harvest. Therefore, the leadership lowered wages to the general market price or below, and at the same time made it clear that supporting the harvest was the same as participating in the war, and that harvesting, threshing, transporting, and storing were all equally meritorious and should enjoy the same treatment. This solved the problem of harvesting, threshing, storing, and transporting being carried out simultaneously. When preparing for war and storing grain, the masses were afraid of the trouble of moving the grain back and forth, and special agents spread rumors that grain taken to the mountains would be thrown into the tiger's mouth. The leadership immediately explained that those with few hands could transfer the grain with the help of the whole village, and that as long as it was for consumption and not smuggling, it would be allowed to pass after proof, exposing the special agents' shameless rumors.

    Unified Leadership, Mutual Assistance and Major Support Between New and Old Areas
    
    In the mutual assistance and major support between the new and old areas, according to the region, the new area took the lead, absorbing the old area to form four district joint command, unifying the use of forces. Cadres took the lead, calculating manpower and animal power, calculating work, and calculating time. The old area, according to all the manpower and animal power and the number of grain received by each grain station, and the number of manpower and animal power needed to support the new area villages, made unified plans and deployments; the new area, according to the existing mu of wheat fields in each village in this area, in addition to organizing the manpower and animal power of this village to participate in the rush harvest, how much support force was needed. The allocation and use of manpower and animal power (harvesting, threshing, transporting, and storing), and the division of time zones, all needed to be studied and organized together in advance to avoid delays and mistakes. However, this summer, this leading institution did not play its due role in each district. The key was that when the county leadership mobilized and deployed the summer harvest, it did not absorb the participation of old area cadres, only made a written instruction once. The main leading cadres of the old area did not participate in the leading institution from beginning to end. The general consequence was that the old area cadres did not have a deep understanding of the importance of the rush harvest, and did not regard it as a unified effort for the whole county, but simply as a help. Ping Shun District also did not pay enough attention to this leading institution. The central task for the old area was simply to hope for support, and did not actively absorb old area cadres to study the work together. As a result, the old area cadres were not involved in this movement, the new area cadres were tense and tired but did not play a big role. Although it was corrected and transformed, the work was still affected.

    The rush harvest organizations in each village generally have the following types: The most common is to organize small-scale labor exchange by household. One is to organize rush harvests by household, absorbing support forces. The third is to adopt the form of large-scale labor exchange in the whole village, dividing the rush harvest according to each person's specific situation, and uniformly adjusting labor and animal power. There are also two forms of labor-military combination: one is that the militia provides cover, and the masses rush harvest by household. The other is that the militia combines with the youth self-defense team on the side of the village facing the enemy, monitoring the enemy on one side and rush harvesting on the other side. Some organized armed labor selling teams. The old area's support for the new area can be divided into two parts. At the beginning, it was based on the principle of voluntariness, organizing a team by village, led by village cadres. However, due to lack of full mobilization and the leadership of cadres, it became chaotic when encountering the enemy, and the work efficiency was not high. In addition, due to the lack of understanding of the situation in the plains, and the inability to properly improve their lives, complaints arose. In order to speed up the assault, the leadership once again carried out mobilization, calling for participation in the war. In the organization, the organizational form of participation in the war was adopted. A sub-team was compiled with the main village as the unit, led by district cadres, and village cadres participated. A group of four people carried out harvesting, bundling, and transportation simultaneously, and stipulated methods and disciplines for transfer and retreat; the other part was to organize voluntary transportation, generally according to the amount of grain received in the district, with the grain station as the organizational unit, dividing the area and organizing the average manpower and animal power for voluntary transportation. In the first district, after dividing the voluntary transportation area, the amount of voluntary transportation was defined according to the manpower and animal power to complete the work.

    Labor-Military Combination Actively Seeks Out the Enemy's Weaknesses

    In protecting the summer harvest, armed struggle is the decisive key. According to the specific circumstances, various labor-military combination methods are adopted, or the armed forces actively seek out the enemy's weaknesses to eliminate the enemy's living forces, creating combat gaps to facilitate the masses' rush harvest; or the militia takes the lead, extending to areas bordering the enemy, monitoring and blocking the enemy, and covering the masses' rush harvest; or the armed forces and militia hold guns in one hand and sickles in the other, helping the masses' rush harvest. The key to victory in the middle lies in "striking first." When the enemy has not yet started to grab grain, actively ambushing the enemy's weaknesses, lowering the enemy's morale for grabbing grain, and disrupting the enemy's grain-grabbing deployment, then mastering the enemy's laws, and continuously attacking the enemy in one place with emphasis, so that they dare not act rashly, facilitating the rush harvest of the masses in this area, and the troops can transfer to another place to attack the enemy, while combining militia guerrilla activities with landmine warfare, making the enemy confused and unable to find the law of our army's activities.

    In militia activities, this struggle proves that the widespread development of landmine warfare is one of the best tactics. Combining landmines with cold guns and ambushes, creating a variety of tactics: The first type is offensive, extending to the vicinity of the enemy's strongholds, and the necessary routes for the enemy to grab grain, pre-ambushing troops to inflict casualties, the militia in the seventh district did the best. The second type is to select the area where the enemy is突击 to arrange a landmine阵, combined with cold gun warfare, to attack the invading enemy, the fourth and fifth districts used more. The third type is to carry out mass landmine warfare, everyone comes up with ideas, everyone lays mines, and every household lays mines, so that wherever the enemy goes, landmines bloom everywhere. The fourth district did the most widely. In the past month and a half, a total of 208 landmines were exploded, killing and wounding 256 enemies, accounting for 60 percent of the total number of killings, injuries, and captures.

　　太谷保卫夏粮斗争总结
    太谷县指挥部  本报资料室整理
    太谷一向是太行二分区边地保粮斗争最激烈的地区，今年麦收前，垂死的阎顽政权为了拖延狗命，曾制定了连他们自己也难以相信的抢粮计划，企图在全县境内（包括路西）掠夺麦子一二五、六四五石——事实上全县所产麦子也不过此数的五分之二。为了进行这一计划，敌人也煞费苦心地做了各种准备工作，以阎伪九纵队司令杨诚与顽县长为首，组成了庞大复杂的所谓“护粮委员会”，以伪九纵队为骨干，结合地方武装“保警大队”及倒算分子组成的“复仇奋斗团”为助，进行武装抢掠。然而，在太谷全县党政军民“保护反攻胜利粮”的坚定斗志下，仅仅半个多月，十万亩麦田已全部抢收完毕，阎伪支付了数百人的代价（连同分区部队，在夏粮斗争中，共毙伤俘敌七○○人左右），抢走——连同逃亡地主运走的——麦子二九四八石。
    解决问题打通思想
    夏收前根据今年整个敌我斗争形势的发展，首先在干部、营兵、民兵、群众中做了广泛的思想动员，把今年护粮斗争的重要性和严重性都做了充分的估计和分析，把保卫麦收当做战胜敌人的战略任务来认识，打破群众中谁家麦子谁家收的各扫门前雪观念。除了进行思想教育外，更主要的是组织积极分子带头，在接敌地区便以政府面目出现组织支援力量抢收，事后再把粮食分给分田户。当时因为麦子歉收，而且工资过高，在抢收中只提出割一亩多少工资，未解决打运藏怎么办，以致支援者只管割，被支援的怕割了不能同时打运藏而受损失，所以不愿让割。于是领导上一面压低工资到一般市价或低于市价，同时明确了支援就是参战，割、打、运、藏都是一样立功，应享受同等待遇，这样才解决了割、打、藏、运同时进行的问题，在备战藏粮时，群众怕来回搬运麻烦，特务又造谣说粮食上了山就送进了虎口。领导上当即说明人手少的以全村互助代为转移，往下运时只要是吃不是走私，经过证明就通行无阻，揭穿了特务的无耻造谣。
    统一领导新老区互助大支援
    在新老区的互助大支援中，根据地区，以新区为主，吸收老区组成了四个区联合指挥部，统一使用力量，干部带头，计算人畜力，计算工作，计算时间，老区根据所有的人畜力及各个粮站收粮的数目，及支援新区那些村需要的人畜力数目，统一筹划调动；新区则根据本区各村现有麦田亩数，除组织本村人畜力参加抢收外，还需要多少支援力量。人畜力的分配使用（割、打、运、藏）、时间地带的划分，都需事先共同研究，共同按排组织，才能避免误时误事。但今夏这一领导机构在各区尚没有发挥其应有的作用。关键在于县领导上动员布置夏收时，未吸收老区干部参加，只做了一次书面指示，老区主要领导干部没有自始至终参加领导机构，普遍产生的后果是老区干部对抢收的重要性认识不深刻，没有把它当做全县统一的，而是单纯的帮助观点。平顺区对于这一领导机构也重视的不够，中心工作对老区是单纯希望支援，没有主动吸收老区干部共同研究工作，结果是老区干部没有卷进这一运动，新区干部紧张疲累而发挥效力不大，虽经纠正转变，工作仍受影响。
    各村抢收组织，一般有以下几种：最普遍的是以户为单位，组织小型变工。一种是以户为单位，吸收支援力量进行抢收。第三是采用全村大变工的形式，根据各个人的具体情况分工抢收，劳力畜力统一调剂。还有劳武结合的两种形式：一种是民兵掩护，群众以户为单位抢收。另一种是民兵结合青年自卫队在本村接敌方面，一面监视敌人一面抢收，群众在村另一面抢收，有的组织武装卖工队。老区对新区的支援可分两部分，开始以自愿为原则，以村为单位组织一个队，由村干领导，但由于缺乏充分动员和干部的领导带头，一遇敌情就混乱起来，工作效率不高，加之对平川情况不了解，生活不能适当改善便发生怨言。领导为加紧突击，再次进行动员，以参战任务作号召，在组织上也采取了参战的组织形式，以主村为单位编一个分队，区干部带领，村干部参加，四人一小组，割、捆、运同时进行，规定出转移退却办法和纪律；另一部是组织义运，一般是按照本区收粮数目，以粮站为组织单位，划分地区，平均组织人畜力义运，在一区则是划分义运地区后，根据人畜力规定义运数量，完成工作。
    劳武结合主动找寻敌人弱点
    在保卫夏收中，武装斗争是决定的关键，根据具体情况，采取各种劳武结合方式，或以武装部队主动找寻敌人弱点，消灭敌人有生力量，创造战斗空隙便于群众抢收；或以民兵为主，伸向接敌地区，监视阻击敌人，掩护群众抢收；或以武装部队民兵一手拿枪一手拿镰，帮助群众抢收。中间致胜的一环，在于“先下手为强”，当敌人抢粮还没有开始时，主动伏击敌人弱点，压低敌人抢粮士气，打乱敌人抢粮布署，然后掌握敌人规律，有重点的连续打击一地敌人，使其不敢蠢动，便利这一地区群众的抢收，部队即可另转一地打击敌人，同时结合民兵游击活动与地雷战，使敌人迷惑找不到我军活动规律。
    在民兵活动中，这次斗争证明普遍开展地雷战是最好的战法之一，以地雷结合冷枪伏击，创造多种战法：第一种是进攻性的，伸到敌人据点附近，及敌人抢粮出发必经之路，预伏部队，予以杀伤，七区民兵作得最好。第二种是选敌人突击的地带布置地雷阵，结合冷枪战，打击进犯敌人，四、五区使用较多。第三种是开展群众性的地雷战，大家出主意，人人埋雷家家埋雷，使敌人所到之处，地雷到处开花。以四区作得最普遍。一个半月来总计爆炸地雷二○八颗，毙伤敌人二五六名，占杀伤俘总数百分之六十。
