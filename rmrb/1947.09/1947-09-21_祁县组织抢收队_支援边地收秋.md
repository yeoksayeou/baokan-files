    Qi County Organizes Harvesting Teams
    to Support Border Area Autumn Harvest

    [Our Newspaper's Report] The First District of Qi County, after receiving instructions from the county, discussed and studied them with district cadres, and then went to various villages to mobilize and organize support teams for the border area's autumn harvest. Under the slogan "Farmers all over the world are one family," the masses recognized that the rear should help the front, and that if the front-line masses have nothing to eat or drink, the rear cannot live well either. After their thinking was cleared, they discussed how to organize. First, they accepted the lessons from this summer's support for the harvest, when the production difficulties of the support team's families were not well resolved, resulting in most people thinking about supporting their husbands by doing odd jobs. After discussion, this time the difficulties were resolved first, with mutual aid teams providing guarantees, and combined with the merit campaign for organization.

    In terms of personnel organization, people who were smart and capable from each village were selected, and some people volunteered to participate.

    On September 4th, 350 harvesting team members gathered at the district government's location. The entire district organized a large team, divided into four platoons. District cadres served as platoon leaders, and village cadres served as squad leaders. Several dozen militiamen formed an armed harvesting team to go deep into the enemy area for harvesting. They departed early on the 5th. (Hao Sheng, Han Hui)

    [Another Dispatch] The front-line harvesting started before the 6th of this month. Participants included the First District harvesting team and local masses, totaling five platoons, with armed cover. The method is that the able-bodied people go to the fields to harvest, carrying it to the ××× transfer station, where cadres at the station mobilize local women, children, and old men to peel the corn (corn husks). After peeling, a transportation team (livestock) transports it to the storage location. After a night of harvesting, more than 30 mu of corn were harvested (equivalent to more than 70 dan), and the team's morale was very high. Each person traveled more than 50 li back and forth, crossing the river six times. Many local women also actively participated, especially two people from Qianzhuang who fell into the river while crossing, getting wet all over but still harvesting three times, staying up all night. Everyone is very enthusiastic and continuing to work.

    祁县组织抢收队
    支援边地收秋
    【本报讯】祁县一区接到县里指示，经区干部讨论研究，即分头下各村动员，组织支援边地抢收队。在“天下农民是一家”的口号下，群众认识了后方应帮助前方，前边群众没有吃喝，后边也不能好活，思想打通后，就讨论如何组织，首先接受了今夏支援抢收，没很好解决支援队的家庭生产困难，结果形成大部份人的支夫打短工思想。经讨论，这次首先解决了困难，有互助组作了保证，并结合立功运动来组织。
    在人员组织上，是选择各村精明强干的人，还有部份人是自报参加。
    九月四号，即有三百五十名抢收队在区公所驻地集中，全区组织了一个大队，下设四个中队，各中队有区干部担任中队长，各村干部任班长，并有民兵数十名，组成一个武装抢收队，深入到敌区抢收，五号早已出发。（郝胜、韩惠）
    【又讯】本月六日前方抢收已开始，参加者有一区抢收队和当地群众共五个中队，并有武装掩护，做法是全劳力到地里抢，背到×××转运站，由站的干部发动当地妇女、儿童、老汉剥皮（剥玉茭皮），剥后即有转运队（牲口）运到保存地点。经过抢收一夜，计抢回玉茭三十余亩（可折七十余石，），大队情绪很高，每人往返五十余里，过河六次。当地群众有不少妇女也积极参加，特别是前庄两个群众过河跌到河里，浑身湿了也抢收了三次，一夜未合眼，大家劲头很大，现继续进行。 
   （祁县战斗报）
