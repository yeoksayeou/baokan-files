    Border Region Postal Headquarters Calls on Employees to Support the Counter-Offensive; Everyone Strives to be a "Flying Courier" to Deliver Letters Between the Front and Rear
    [This Newspaper's Report] Just as the speed improvement campaign in the Border Region Postal Service had concluded and a technical improvement campaign was vigorously unfolding, news of our five-route army's full-scale counter-offensive arrived, greatly inspiring the employees. Over a hundred military postal workers from the Hebei-Shandong-Henan and Hebei-Henan areas, as well as the Taihang region, have already followed Liu and Deng's army south. The Taiyue District Bureau chief personally led over thirty staff members and the Taihang Military Postal Bureau to follow Chen and Xie's army across the river to closely connect the front and rear and to open up new postal work in the newly liberated areas. The Border Region Postal General Bureau and the Postal Workers' Union have issued urgent instructions to the entire region, calling on all employees to immediately take action, cooperate with the full-scale counter-offensive, persevere, increase speed, and vigorously launch a technical improvement competition. First, quickly resolve river obstructions and immediately overcome all stagnation caused by the rainy season to ensure on-time delivery. Second, deeply improve rural postal work, save civilian labor, and increase speed. Third, general mail must obey military mail and proactively help military mail solve all difficulties. Fourth, launch a technical improvement competition, eliminate all errors, and strengthen postal speed. Fifth, combine work with class examination and ideological examination, enhance class consciousness, create more "flying couriers" and "motorized" technical experts, fully utilize the functions of the people's postal service, and strengthen the counter-offensive. Upon hearing the news of our army's counter-offensive, the Border Region Postal School was filled with joy, unanimously shouting: "We must clear our minds, quickly let go of burdens, accelerate the completion of our studies, and welcome new work positions." Many local cadres who were previously unwilling to leave home said: "The so-called difficulties in leaving home were all personal enjoyment issues. Now we have cleared our minds, and for the sake of the counter-offensive, we should abandon personal interests and obey the organization's allocation in everything. We are willing to be transferred anywhere."
    [Another News Item] The Border Region Postal General Bureau and the Postal Workers' Union recently sent a telegram of greetings to all employees of the Liu-Deng and Chen-Xie Field Army Postal Bureaus, stating: "We are infinitely moved by your southward journey with the army and the triumphant news that has arrived. We hope you will work hard, bravely and tenaciously complete your tasks, build the people's postal service in the new areas, and serve the people of the new areas. We all pledge to be your backing, and together we will fight to defeat the Chiang bandits and liberate all of China as soon as possible." (Nong, Sutang)
