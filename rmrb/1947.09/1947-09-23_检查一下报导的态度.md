    Examine the Reporting Attitude
    Bomín
    [Our Newspaper] Comrade Bomín from the Taihang Administrative Office sent a letter examining reporting methods, excerpts of which are presented below for joint study: (1) First, there are many lengthy summary reports and few timely news reports. In fact, most of our comrades spend a lot of time working in the countryside. As long as they pay attention to observation and consciously collect and sort out information, they can provide the Party newspaper with many news articles. But why is this area so poorly done? The main reason is that we have a tendency to not value news reporting ideologically, believing that we don't need to write general news because there are plenty of people who do that. We should only devote ourselves to more mature and complete research and reporting on a movement or a problem. In a word, we have a "greedy" mentality, so even if some materials could be used as news, we cannot report them in time. (2) When we delve into a problem, we often isolate it, lacking a comprehensive observation and research of all aspects related to the problem. In order to organize a problem, we only collect materials from this one side, so sometimes we can only say what the problem itself is like, but cannot see how it relates to other aspects and the entire work (or at least the explanation is insufficient). For example, when we organize the experience of auxiliary labor, we only analyze and study the problem itself, without explaining well how it relates to the overall mutual aid relationship in the local area. In fact, the mutual aid foundation, the degree of labor shortage, and the equivalent value, wages, etc., related to this vary from place to place, which gives rise to various influences on the organization of auxiliary labor. We have not paid enough attention to this aspect. (3) There are more introductions of relatively successful experiences, or more praise (relatively speaking, there are also many that should be praised but have not been), and fewer introductions of failures and lessons, and less appropriate criticism. In fact, there are many successes, but there are also many failures. At the same time, some successful experiences are often gained through several failures. If they can be introduced appropriately, it will be beneficial to promoting the work. In terms of criticism, it seems today that as long as we are factual, start from the good intention of improving our work, and criticize appropriately, it will become "bitter medicine," which is completely different from deliberately finding fault and maliciously attacking. As for how much "empty talk" exists in our past communications, because the cadres have not yet returned, we cannot conduct a collective inspection. We plan to conduct a more in-depth inspection when the cadres are all together in the future.

    检查一下报导的态度
    渤民
    【本报讯】太行行署渤民同志来信，检查报导方法，现摘录如下，俾共同研究：（一）首先是长篇总结性的报导多，而及时的新闻报导少。其实我们大部份同志下乡工作时间很多，只要是留意观察和有意识的搜集和整理，便会供给党报很多的新闻稿件，但为什在这一方面做的很差呢？主要原因是我们思想上存在着不重视新闻报导的倾向，认为一般新闻用不着我们动手，写的人多得很，我们只应致力于一个运动或一个问题较为成熟与完整的研究，报导，一句话，我们有“贪大的”思想，因此，分明有些材料很可以作为新闻材料，也不能及时报导出去。（二）我们在深入一个问题时，往往成了孤立一个问题，缺乏和这一问题有联系的各个方面作全面的观察，研究，为了整理一个问题，就只搜集这一面的材料，所以有时只能说出这一问题本身是如何？而看不出它和其它方面及整个工作的关系如何？（至少也是说明的不足），比如我们整理组织辅助劳力经验，也是只就问题本身加以分析研究，没有很好说明它和当地整个互助关系如何？事实上各地互助基础，劳力缺乏程度及与此有关的等价、工资等均有不同，这都给予组织辅助劳力上以种种影响，我们恰恰就在这一方面注意不足。（三）介绍较为成功的经验多，或是表扬多（比较而言，也有不少应表扬而未注意表扬的），而介绍失败教训少，适当的批评少。事实上成功的固然多，而失败的却也不少，同时，某些成功的经验往往也是在经历了若干失败中得来的。如能恰如其分的介绍出来，对工作推动是有好处的。在批评方面，今天看来，只要我们合乎事实，从善意的改进工作出发，批评得当，就会成为“苦口良药”，这完全不同于专找岔子，恶意攻击。至于我们过去的通讯中存在着“客里空”的成份究有多大，因目前干部还未回来，不能进行集体检查，拟在将来干部凑齐时再作较为深刻的检查。
