　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, August 28th: A radio broadcast from Yogyakarta on the 25th stated that an International Brigade composed of overseas Chinese, Indians, and Filipinos sympathetic to the Indonesian people's liberation movement has been formally established in Indonesia. Indonesian military authorities have made decisions regarding the time and place for the International Brigade to fight alongside the Indonesian army to resist Dutch aggression. It is understood that 400 people have joined the International Brigade. The Overseas Chinese Volunteer Army recently organized in Solo will cooperate with the International Brigade.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, August 28th: Chenggong Lake News: On the 26th, the Security Council passed a new Polish proposal with an overwhelming majority of ten votes, namely, the Security Council reaffirmed the ceasefire order and demanded that both the Dutch and Indonesian sides abide by it. The day before (the 25th), the Security Council passed a proposal by Australia and Chiang's representative with seven votes to zero, resolving to appeal to the governments of all member states of the Security Council to have their Consuls-General stationed in Batavia report to the Security Council on the implementation of the ceasefire order. The Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, Colombia, and Poland abstained. Soviet representative Gromyko pointed out: "The United States is vigorously supporting the Chinese (Chiang) and Australian proposal, aiming to play a new conspiracy, because there are only five countries' consuls in Batavia: China (Chiang), France, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Switzerland, among which France, the United Kingdom, and the United States completely maintain the Netherlands, while Switzerland is not a member of the United Nations." The Soviet Union's amendment to establish a committee by the Security Council to monitor the implementation of the ceasefire received seven votes in favor. However, under the instigation of the United States, France unreasonably used its veto power to reject it, which further exposed the United States' conspiracy to continue to protect the Netherlands from undermining the ceasefire order and launching a major offensive against the Indonesian liberated areas.

　　国际纵队在印尼成立
  　与印尼军并肩作战抵抗荷军
    安理会通过波兰新建议重申停战令
    【新华社陕北二十八日电】据日惹二十五日广播称：由同情印尼人民解放运动之华侨、印度人及菲律滨人所组成的国际纵队已在印尼正式成立，印尼军事当局对于国际军与印尼军并肩作战以抵抗荷兰侵略之时间及地点，已有所决定。据悉参加国际纵队者已有四百人。最近在梭罗组织之华侨志愿军，将与国际军合作。
    【新华社陕北二十八日电】成功湖讯：二十六日安理会以十票之压倒多数通过波兰所提之新建议，即由安理会重申停战令，并要求荷印双方恪守此令。在此前一天（二十五日），安理会以七票对零票通过澳洲及蒋代表之提议，决议吁请安理会各会员国政府驻巴城总领事向安理会报告停战令实施情形。苏、英、哥伦比亚及波兰弃权。苏代表葛罗米柯指出：“美国极力支持中（蒋）澳提案，旨在玩弄新的阴谋，因巴城仅有中（蒋）、法、英、美及瑞士等五国领事，其中法、英、美三国完全维护荷兰，而瑞士则非联合国会员。”苏联所提由安理会成立委员会监视停战实施情形之修正案，获得七票赞成。但在美国之嗾使下，竟被法国无理使用否决权而否决，此益发暴露了美国仍图庇护荷兰破坏停战令大事进攻印尼解放区之阴谋。
