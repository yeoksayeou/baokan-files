Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, September 24th: TASS, New York, September 22nd: Despite the yelping and barking of newspapers controlled by American monopoly capital, liberal newspapers are able to accept some of Vyshinsky's views from his speech at the UN General Assembly. The afternoon newspaper's editorial on the 20th stated: No reader of an American newspaper and no one familiar with the government's current policies can deny the fact that there are many people, both inside and outside the government, who are deliberately inciting public opinion to prepare for war against the Soviet Union; however, the Soviet Union has not initiated any attempt to incite public opinion against the United States. The newspaper also believes that Vyshinsky's exposure of warmongers like Brooks and Earl is beneficial to peace. The Soviet Union has good reason to protest the creation of a war atmosphere by U.S. government officials, such as Secretary of Commerce Harriman, who recently demanded war against the Soviet Union in Seattle. The afternoon newspaper also believes that, as Vyshinsky said, Dulles represents a small but powerful group that is creating a war psychology out of hostility, either to restore Germany's war industrial potential under that pretext, or to genuinely prepare for war, or to achieve both goals simultaneously. The newspaper calls for the removal of new war instigators like Dulles from government positions and demands that U.S. government officials show some "self-restraint" and express sincerity in international cooperation.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, September 23rd: United Press, Philadelphia: Wallace, in a speech here on the 19th, exposed Truman's clumsy tactics of creating a "crisis atmosphere," stating that Truman's order for Secretary of Defense Forrestal to take office early was "a shocking event in the creation of a hysteria movement in the United States" (note: Truman issued the order on the 17th while returning home aboard the battleship Missouri, the same day as Marshall's speech at the UN General Assembly). Wallace pointed out: Truman said "the international situation is critical" and ordered Forrestal to take office, but refused to discuss this critical issue, which is the lowest form of creating fear.

    美自由主义报纸评称：维氏揭露战争贩子对于和平大有裨益
    【新华社陕北二十四日电】塔斯社二十二日纽约讯：维辛斯基在联大的演讲，尽管美国独占资本控制下的报纸在狺狺狂吠，然而自由主义的报纸却能接受维氏的某些意见。二十日下午报的社论称：没有一个美国报纸的读者和熟悉政府现行政策的人，能够否认这件事实，即是有很多在政府内外的人，居心煽动舆论准备对苏战争；但苏联却并没有发动舆论反美的企图。该报又认为维氏暴露布鲁克斯与欧尔等战争贩子，对于和平是有益的。苏联很有根据的抗议美政府官员制造战争空气，例如商务部长哈里曼不久前即在西雅图要求对苏作战。下午报又认为诚如维氏所说，杜勒斯代表一个狭小然而却有势力的集团，他们敌意制造战争心理，以借口恢复德国战争工业潜力，或真正准备战争，或是同时要达到这两个目的。该报要求革除新战争挑拨者杜勒斯这类人的政府职位，要求美政府官员表现一点“自制”，并在国际合作中表示诚意。
    【新华社陕北二十三日电】合众社费城讯，华莱士十九日在此发表谈话揭露杜鲁门制造“危急空气”的拙劣手法称，杜鲁门命令国防部长福莱斯特尔提前就职，乃“在美国制造歇斯特里亚运动中之一项惊人事件”（按杜氏命令系于十七日乘密苏里战舰返国途中发出，是日亦为马歇尔在联大演说之日）。华氏指出：杜鲁门谓“国际情势危急”而令福氏就职，然又拒绝讨论此项危急问题，此实为制造恐惧之最低劣手法。
