　　Marching to the North Bank of the Yangtze River to Undertake a Glorious Mission
  　Cixian Masses Cheer on Southern-Bound Cadres

[Report from Cixian] To welcome the arrival of the new situation, more than seventy district and village cadres from Cixian marched south on September 12th. The county magistrate and county secretary were at the front lines and missed the chance to send them off, but wrote a letter halfway saying: "You are going to cross the Yellow River and go south to fight against the traitor Chiang Kai-shek, and help the oppressed peasants in the Chiang-occupied areas to stand up. This is the glory of the Cixian Party and the people of Cixian... The Party is responsible for guaranteeing the solution to your difficulties and problems, please rest assured, and wish you a safe journey. We will meet in the Yangtze River area in the future!" On September 12th, all the personnel of the agencies and schools stationed in Pengcheng came to see them off. Especially when the masses heard that their own cadres were going to cross the river to help the peasants stand up, about 2,000 people, including workers, peasants, women, students, and merchants, were stirred up early in the morning, even forgetting to eat breakfast. The streets were plastered with slogans such as "Salute to the resolute and brave Southern-Bound Cadres" and "Southern-Bound Cadres are good cadres who serve the masses." When the Southern-Bound cadres were seen off outside Wenchang Pavilion, they shouted in unison: "Southern-Bound Cadres are our excellent cadres, we will support you with production and thrift in the rear," "We are responsible for any difficulties in the family, your parents are our parents..." Comrade Yu Xiushan, the representative of the Southern-Bound cadres, replied on the stage: "You continue to re-investigate and thoroughly liberate yourselves in the rear. We will respond to you with practical actions in the South, thoroughly defeat Chiang Kai-shek, the bullies, and the landlords, and help the Southern peasants stand up. We will not go home until the Southern peasants have stood up." Amidst the cheers of gongs and drums, they marched south happily. (Chen Yifeng)

[Report from the Hebei-Luyu Area, September 17th] The news of the national counter-offensive has spread, and all the rear agencies here are encouraged and excited. On the evening of the 12th, when this newspaper's radio station received the New China News Agency's editorial and news report on the "National Counter-Offensive," all the radio station personnel worked hard and sent the telegram to the editorial department in the middle of the night. The comrades in the editorial office prepared the report before dawn. After the printing bureau and newspaper factory received the newspaper manuscript and the task of printing 2,000 copies of the newspaper and 10,000 copies of the news bulletin, all the worker comrades worked all night with unprecedented tension. Comrade Zhang ＠shan worked day and night without closing his eyes to create a map of the counter-offensive situation. The newspaper's editorial board held an emergency meeting at 10:00 am to study the counter-offensive situation and the overall work policy of the newspaper, and decided to first launch a study of the current situation within the newspaper, eliminate the vague views on the understanding of the situation, examine the ideology and rectify the position, and formulate the policy of action for the entire newspaper from the bottom up, in order to cooperate with the national counter-offensive with practical work achievements. According to the spirit of the editorial board, the various departments of the communication department immediately arranged the interview and reporting work after the arrival of the counter-offensive. After the office reported the news of the counter-offensive to the village cadres, the whole village immediately held a mass meeting to report the news of the counter-offensive, discuss the autumn harvest and wheat planting work, and decided to increase the area of wheat planting to ensure the food supply for the counter-offensive troops. Each family also made a wheat planting plan and launched a wheat planting mutual assistance competition. The newspaper office allocated all the livestock to help the masses pull plows and cultivate the land. The post office held an emergency meeting overnight and put forward the slogan of "One is worth ten, a hundred is worth ten," calling on all postal workers in the area to take urgent action to complete the following tasks: (1) Further implement rapid movement, try every means to overcome the difficulties of transportation in the rainy season, and restore night shifts where possible. (2) Local post offices should also obey military postal tasks. Wherever the troops are stationed, the local post office should take the initiative to contact the military post office and try every means to solve all the difficulties of the military post. (3) Collect a part of the read newspapers in a planned and organized way and distribute them to the guerrilla areas, newly liberated areas, cities and large towns. Actively cooperate with local propaganda and education departments to write blackboard newspapers and use loudspeakers to broadcast the news of victory to the countryside at any time. (4) Carry out a campaign to check the position and improve the fast mail service.
