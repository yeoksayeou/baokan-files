　　Man Can Conquer Nature
  　A Cross-Section of Mutual Aid Production in Nanliu Village
    Li Zhuang
    For four years, Nanliu Village in Qiuxian County has engaged in mutual aid production, defeating enemy sabotage and overcoming natural disasters, and this year it is expected to achieve a surplus of 30% after paying the rent. This short history is full of stories of the arduous, persistent, and indomitable struggles of poor peasants.

    This is a barren village, surrounded by sand on three sides and low-lying land on the other, making it impossible to harvest crops in drought, flood, or wind. The locals call it "flying sand and thin soil." The village originally had 525 people and 2,639 mu of land. Four or five landlords owned almost 681 mu of good land, accounting for 60% of the total, while poor and very poor peasants had basically no good land, making life very difficult.

    In 1931, there was a drought and no wheat could be planted; in 1932, there was a drought and no autumn crops could be planted. Later, some late seedlings were planted, but they were hit by hail. People began to die of hunger, and a cholera epidemic broke out in the autumn, causing even more deaths. Those who were fortunate enough not to collapse mostly fled; by the spring of 1933, only forty people remained in the entire village.

    The Communist Party urgently called on and led the masses to "overcome famine through mutual aid production." The spring of 1933 was also the most severe period of the famine. The district head of the democratic government came to Nanliu Village and led the masses to establish a long-term labor team and two short-term labor teams, beginning an unprecedented era of mutual aid production.

    The long-term labor team consisted of seven people, all extremely poor bachelors. The government provided each person with two jin of grain per day, and the seeds were also provided by the government. Mutual aid was implemented through the "exchange of land." Everyone pooled their land, using the person with the most land as the standard. Those with less land were compensated from the village's wasteland to meet the standard. A total of 210 mu were planted. Before the famine, the village had 70 livestock, but at this time there were none. Plowing the land could only be done by people pulling the plow. The seven people ate together in a large pot, producing during the day, with four people grinding grain into flour in the evening, two people digging wild vegetables in the fields, and one person cooking. The two short-term labor teams consisted of a dozen people, whose families were slightly better off than those in the long-term labor team. The government provided each person with 28 liang of grain per day, which they supplemented with their own food to eat at home. The method of "exchanging land" and cultivation was the same as that of the long-term labor team.

    The enemy began a major "mopping-up" operation on the Dragon Boat Festival, forcing Nanliu Village to "maintain order." The Communist Party branch led the masses in a resolute struggle against the enemy, preventing them from taking a single grain of food. Sowing continued during the "mopping-up" operation. When the enemy got too close, they would put down their farm tools, carry the seeds on their backs and run, then circle back and continue planting.

    When the seedlings grew to about a foot high, a plague of locusts suddenly appeared, devouring the early seedlings in an instant. People's spirits were temporarily depressed. The Communist Party called on the peasants to persevere, "replant to save lives." The will to survive and the assistance of the Party and the government enabled the peasants to regain their resolve, fighting the locusts and eating them, and carrying out a second round of emergency planting.

    The government also led the organization of a transportation team, using dividends to relieve the disaster. A thirteen or fourteen-year-old boy from the long-term labor team was selected to transport goods. Apart from his own food and drink, the dividends were distributed to the team. The budding combination of agriculture and sideline production was thus generated.

    The autumn harvest that year was not bad. The long-term and short-term labor teams both distributed grain equally. The disparity in value was obvious, but one or two people could not cultivate the land alone, and collective plowing was necessary. In order to survive the famine, the peasants had no time or possibility to come up with methods for recording work points or converting labor. However, the power of mutual aid was clearly evident.

    After the autumn harvest, the village bought nine cattle, some purchased jointly by members of the long-term and short-term labor teams, and some purchased by the landlords themselves. The county held a labor hero conference, and the Nanliu Village long-term labor team was awarded the title of model team and given a large, fat ox.

    On October 14th, the enemy in Weixian County suddenly attacked Nanliu Village, looting all the cattle and remaining clothing. Having had the experience of overcoming difficulties through collective struggle in the previous period, the peasants were not intimidated by the enemy and remained resolutely opposed to "maintaining order." The democratic government provided each person with 50 jin of mung beans as capital and opened seven vermicelli mills. People ate bean dregs and sold bean flour to make money, which played a decisive role in helping Nanliu Village overcome the famine and survive the winter. The vermicelli mills were operated by the labor teams, and the money was shared collectively. The complete integration of agriculture and sideline production became a unique characteristic of the mutual aid movement in Nanliu Village. Even now, there are no mutual aid groups that engage solely in agriculture or sideline production.

    In the winter, people who had fled the famine returned one after another. The village had 208 people, and although there was bran mixed in the rice, they could eat their fill.

    In the spring of 1934, the peasants reduced rent and interest for the landlords, recovering more than 200 mu of land and more than 1,000 jin of grain. In particular, they collected more than 60 mu of wheat seedling land. Victory after victory, the peasants who had suffered so much were extremely excited. In the struggle, they established a peasant association consisting of 22 people. The distribution of the fruits of labor was not based on problems, but all the poor were given a share, with the very poor receiving more.

    As the population increased, the long-term and short-term labor teams dispersed, and members found partners to form mutual aid groups. Everyone had been through hardship and had their lives saved by mutual aid. Sharing their experiences made it easier to get others to understand. At this time, the village still had no cattle, so plowing the land had to be done by people pulling the plow. Mutual aid was still essential, and seven groups were formed at once. The seven people from the long-term labor team were distributed to each group, and to this day, these people are still the backbone of mutual aid. Among these people, Yuan Zhaolin, the first labor hero of Qiuxian County, emerged.

    After mutual aid had been practiced for a while according to the old methods, some people began to complain: "So-and-so is missing work, but will get the same amount of grain in the future. It's not fair, it won't work!" Everyone felt this problem, and it became the focus of discussion in the village. Some people said: "Don't worry, record how many shifts everyone works, and distribute grain according to the records in the future." Yuan Zhaolin absorbed this suggestion and compared it with the experience he had learned from other areas at the labor hero conference. He first implemented the shift recording method (accounting method) in his own group. Whoever worked a shift was given a small work point. The number of work points used on his land and the number of work points he had worked in the group were recorded, and the shortfall was made up in the future. The accounting method increased the flexibility of mutual aid production. Anyone with urgent business who needed to miss work could ask the group leader for leave, without feeling constrained. Those who worked more received more grain and did not suffer losses. Other groups saw that this method was good and adopted it after a dozen days.

    That year, both the wheat and autumn harvests were bountiful, and the number of livestock increased to 28. People no longer ate bran, but still had to eat bean dregs. When planting wheat, some people raised many objections to the accounting method: "I'm illiterate, and I don't know if others are fiddling with the accounts, I'm just afraid there will be problems!" "My skills are good, how can someone else's shift be worth the same as mine? It's a bit unfair!" Yuan Zhaolin, seeing this problem, put a lot of effort into thinking: "How can we make it beneficial to everyone?" Whenever he had time, he would discuss this issue with everyone, learning from this person and learning from that person. Finally, he created a work point system, with detailed regulations on how to convert labor. People were evaluated by everyone based on their physical strength and technical skill, and given a work point score. They could increase their score if they improved, and if they were not good at this kind of work but good at that kind of work, they could change. When cattle and people worked together to plow the land, the cost of cattle labor was higher and the cattle's share was set higher. When weeding and harvesting in the autumn, the cost of manual labor was higher and the human share was set higher. The amount of labor used on land that was far away and had a lot of weeds was more than that used on land that was close and had few weeds. Sideline production, building houses, making clothes... all had specific scores set according to rural customs. Wartime service and substitute farming were all resolved within the mutual aid group, and were given the same score.

    The work points were kept by the group members themselves. They received one work point for each shift worked. The procedure was simple, and even if they were illiterate, they would not be deceived. This work point method was basically the same as the mature work point accounting and labor conversion methods in other regions. Finally, the problems of equal value and trouble were solved. Nanliu Village has been using it to this day, and no shortcomings have been found. Specifically, it is reflected in the fact that the peasants all like it.

    In the winter of that year, a review was conducted and another landlord was overthrown. The peasants recovered an oil press, a house, and more than 50 mu of land.

    In 1935, people continued to return, and the village increased to 94 households. The number of livestock gradually increased, and people no longer had to pull the plow. Two thousand seven hundred mu of land were planted (slightly more than before the famine, due to the purchase of land from other villages). Unfortunately, the wheat harvest was poor, and the autumn seedlings were flooded, resulting in only 30% to 40% of the normal harvest. There was not enough grain to eat, so in the winter they concentrated their efforts on sideline production, adding three vermicelli mills, two cotton gins, and a mill. The peasants voluntarily saved money, and bean dregs became the main food, saving grain to buy cattle and support agriculture.

    In the autumn and winter, land reform was launched, and the remaining landlords were finally overthrown. Several feudal rich peasants were also stripped of their tails. The peasants recovered 17 rooms, 62 mu of land, and many pieces of furniture and trees. Each person filled in at least four and a half mu of land.

    Like a snowball rolling, the number of mutual aid groups increased to 12 in the past year. The vast majority of the village's labor force participated in mutual aid.

    In the first month of 1936, taking advantage of the slack farming season, the mutual aid groups were reorganized, and last year's accounts were fully settled. Historical reasons and the scientific work point system made the peasants deeply aware of the benefits of mutual aid. Everyone was willing to continue mutual aid, but some people felt that they were not suited to their groups. Village cadres and labor heroes understood that "dogs match fur, people match eyebrows, and compatibility leads to longevity." After all other problems were solved, "compatibility" became even more important. Everyone knew that "if you can talk things over, everything is easy to handle." Therefore, they proposed "free association" and "free group jumping." The masses elected ten upright and prestigious labor heroes and activists as banners. Through their connections, they found compatible people and deliberated for five days, forming twelve groups. More than 90% of the village's full and part-time labor force joined the mutual aid groups. Agriculture and sideline production remained fully integrated, and under the influence of the men, the women also developed ten textile groups.

    The village also established a production committee, formulated household plans and village-wide production plans, and further coordinated cooperation in all aspects.

    This year, the number of cattle increased to 35, still almost half of what it was before the famine. There was drought followed by flooding, and the millet was planted twice. There was more land than before the famine, but less labor. Each laborer had to cultivate an average of 32 mu of land. In terms of natural conditions, everything was still worse than before the famine. However, because of full-scale organization, not only was a considerable amount of wartime service labor saved, but all the autumn seedlings were hoed one or two times more. Sideline production earned a dividend of more than 5.76 million yuan in five months, which, when converted into grain, was enough to feed the entire village for 115 days. Fertilizer is a major problem in the plains, especially in disaster areas. This year, Nanliu Village concentrated its efforts on collecting manure from the vermicelli mills, buying livestock to collect manure, and using ash and green grass to make manure. The amount of fertilizer accumulated has reached 2,270 cartloads, nearly one large cartload per mu, far exceeding the current general level.

　　人能胜天
  　南刘村互助生产纵断面
    李庄
    邱县南刘村互助生产四年，打败敌祸战胜天灾，今年可望达到耕三余一。这段不长的历史中，充满贫苦农民艰忍卓绝，百折不挠的斗争故事。
    这是一个贫瘠的村庄，三面环沙，一面是洼地，旱、涝、刮风都不能收。老百姓叫作“飞沙薄地”。全村原有五百二十五口人、二千六百三十九亩土地、四、五户地主几乎占有六百八十一亩好地的百分之六十，贫农和赤贫基本没有一亩好地，生活是很苦的。
    三十一年天旱，未能种上麦子；三十二年天旱，没有种上秋庄稼，后来种上一些晚苗，又被雹子打了，人们开始因饥饿而死亡，秋天霍乱流行，死人更多，幸而没有躺倒的则大部逃亡；到三十三年春天，全村剩了四十个人。
    共产党紧急号召与领导群众“互助生产渡荒”，三十三年春天也是灾荒最严重的时候，民主政府的区长到了南刘村，领导群众成立了一个长工队，两个短工队，开始了历史上从来没有过的互助生产。
    长工队七个人，都是极贫的光棍汉，政府每天贷给一个人两斤粮食吃，种籽也是政府贷的。互助采用“兑地”的办法，每个人把自己的土地都积起来，以土地最多的一人为标准，地少的从全村的荒地中补足标准数，一共种了二百一十亩。灾荒前，全村有七十个牲口，这时候一个也没有了，种地只能人拉犁，七个人伙吃大锅饭，白天生产，晚上四个人磨谷子面、两个人到地里挖野菜、一个人作饭，两个短工队共有十几个人，都是家中情况比长工队稍好些的，政府每人每天贷给一个人二十八两粮食，参加者以这些粮食配上自己贴补的一些，在自己家里吃饭，“兑地”和耕种的方法，都与长工队相同。
    敌人在端午节开始大“扫荡”，强迫南刘村“维持”。共产党支部领导群众和敌人坚持斗争，没有被敌人拿走一颗粮食，下种在“扫荡”中继续进行，敌人离他们很近了，放下农具背上种籽就跑，转个圈子回来再种。
    苗子长到尺把高，突然发生蝗虫，早苗一晌而光，人们的情绪一度沮丧。共产党号召农民们再接再厉，“补种救命”求生的意志和党与政府的援助，使农民们重新坚定起来，打蝗虫吃蝗虫，进行第二次抢种。
    政府又领导组织运输队，以红利救灾，长工队抽出一个十三、四岁的少年运输，除了他自己的吃喝，红利归队中分，他的地由其他六个人代种。萌芽的农副结合就此产生了。
    这一年秋收不坏，长工队、短工队都是平均分粮，不等价是很显然的，但是一两个人不能种地，非集体拉犁不可，为了渡荒活命，农民们来不及与不可能想出记工、折工的办法，互助的力量却很明显的看出来了。
    秋后，村里买了九头牛，有些是长、短工队的成员伙买，有些是地主自己买的。县里召开劳英会，南刘村长工队获得模范队的称号，奖了一头大肥牛。
    十月十四日，威县敌人突袭南刘村，将耕牛及仅存的衣物全部抢去，农民们有了前一段集体奋斗克服困难的经验，没有被敌人吓倒，仍然坚决不“维持”，民主政府就贷给每一个人五十斤绿豆作本钱，开了七座粉坊，人吃豆渣，卖粕粉赚钱，对南刘村渡荒过冬起了决定的作用。粉坊由工队经营，卖了钱伙分，农副彻底结合，成为南刘村互助运动的一点特点。直到现在，仍没有单搞农业或副业的互助组。
    冬天逃荒在外的人陆续回来，全村有二百零八个人，饭里米渗糠，但是可以吃饱了。
    三十四年春天，农民们向地主减租减息，收回二百多亩土地，一千多斤粮食，特别是收集了六十多亩麦苗地，胜利加胜利，饱受熬煎的农民们兴奋极了，在斗争中建立了包括二十二个人的农会，分果实不按问题，是穷人都分，赤贫分的多些。
    人多了，长、短工队分散，成员们自找对象，成立互助组。大家都是过来人，靠互助救了命，现身说法，比较容易打通其他人的思想。这时村里还没有牛，种地就得人拉犁，还是非互助不可，一下成立了七个组，长工队里的七个人在每个组中分了一个，到今天这些人还是互助的骨干，这批人当中，产生了邱县第一名劳动英雄袁兆林。
    按照过去的办法，互助了一段时间，有些人就嚷嚷开了：“某人缺了工，将来一样分粮食，不公道，不行！”大家都感觉到了这个问题，一时成为村里议论的中心。有些人就说：“这不怕，谁作几晌给他记上帐，将来照帐分粮。”袁兆林吸收了这个意见，和自己在劳英会上吸收的其他地区经验对照起来，先在自己组里实行了记晌法（记帐法），谁到一晌给谁记一小工，看他的地用了多少工，他在组中作了多少工，将来长得短补。记帐法增加了互助生产的机动性，谁有要紧事情，一定要误一下工，可以向组长请假，不致感到拘束；多作了工的得到粮食，也不吃亏，其他组看着这个办法好，十几天后都采用了。
    这一年，麦、秋两季丰收，牲口增至廿八头，人们已不吃糠，但是还得吃豆渣。种麦时，有些人对记帐法又提出许多意见：“我不识字，别人上花帐，我不知道，光怕有点问题！”“我的把式好，某人一晌怎么能顶我一晌？有点不公！”袁兆林看着这个问题，大下工夫用脑子：“看怎么能对大家都有好处？”有时间就和大家拉扯这个问题，学你这一点学他这一点，最后创造出工票制，细密的规定折工办法，人按劳力强弱、技术好坏，由大家评议出顶工分数，进步了可以增作，这种活不行作那种活很好时，可以改变。牛与人变工犁地时，牛工贵牛分订得高些。锄草秋收时，人工贵人分订得高些。地远草多的地所用工数，比地近草少的多些。副业、盖房、作衣服………都按照农村习惯订出具体分数。战勤、代耕都在互助组中解决，同样顶分。
    工票由组员自己保存，作一工给一票，手续简便，不识字也不会受骗。这种工票办法，和其他地区成熟的计工、折工办法基本上一样。最后解决了等价与麻烦的问题。南刘村一直应用到今天，还没有发现有什么缺点，具体表现在农民们都喜欢他。
    这年冬天复查，又斗倒一户地主，农民们收回一座油房、一座房子和五十多亩地。
    三十五年，仍有人陆续回来，全村增至九十四户，牲口渐多，已经不用人拉犁了，种了两千七百亩地（比灾荒前增加一些，是买了外村的）。不幸，麦季收成不好，秋苗又被水淹了，只有三、四成收，粮食不够吃，到冬季集中全力搞副业，增加三个粉房，两架弹花弓和一座磨房，农民们自动节约，豆渣成为主要食品，省下粮食购买耕牛，支援农业。
    秋冬揭土地改革，最后斗倒残余地主，几户封建富农也割掉尾巴，农民们又收回房屋十七间、土地六十二亩和许多家具、树木，每个人最少填平到四亩半地。
    象雪球打滚一样，互助组在去年一年中，发展到十二组，全村绝大部分劳力都参加了互助。
    三十六年正月里，乘农闲整顿互助，把去年的帐目总结算一下，欠粮的最后还清。历史的原因和科学的工票法，使农民们都深刻的认识到互助的好处，谁也愿意继续互助下去，但是有些人觉得不对心思，村干部和劳动英雄们懂得“狗对毛皮人对眉眼，心投意合能长远”，在其他问题都解决以后，“对心思”就更重要了。谁都知道“说得来，什么都好办”，于是提出“自由结合”、“自由跳组”，由群众选出十个正派有威信的劳英和积极分子作旗号，通过他们串连找对心思人，酝酿串连了五天，结成十二个组，全村全半劳力的百分之九十以上，都到了互助组里，农副业仍然完全结合，妇女们在男人影响下，也发展到十个纺织组。
    村里又建立了生产委员会，订立了按家计划和全村生产计划，各方面的互相配合，更趋协调。
    今年耕牛增加到三十五头，比灾荒前仍少几乎二分之一。先旱后涝，谷子种了两遍，地比灾荒前多了，劳力少了，每个劳力平均要种三十二亩地，从自然条件上说，一切还不如灾荒以前，就是因为全面组织起来，不但省出数目相当庞大的战勤劳力，还把所有秋苗都多锄了一遍到两遍。五个月副业赚红利五百七十六万余元，买成粮食，够全村吃一百一十五天。肥料在平原特别在灾区是个大问题，南刘村今年集中精力在粉房集粪、买牲口集粪、用灰土和青草造粪，所积肥料已达二千二百七十车，几合每亩一大车，远远超过现有的一般水平。
