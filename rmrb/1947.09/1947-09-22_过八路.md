    The Eighth Route Army Arrives
    Jie Qing
    "The Eighth Route Army is coming, the Eighth Route Army is coming," the orioles (note) who arrive from the south at the beginning of summer, call out all day long, so clearly and so loudly.
    The villages around Jialing Town (under the jurisdiction of Xiangcheng County) all heard this cry. When the head of the baojia system wasn't around, people would stop what they were doing and say, "What is this oriole calling about? It sounds so nice." "What's it calling? It's calling 'The Eighth Route Army is coming, the Eighth Route Army is coming.' It's been calling all summer, haven't you heard? Sometimes it also calls 'Kill the bachelors, kill the bachelors'" (in the local area, wealthy and powerful people who oppress the people are called bachelors). And as usual, someone would add:
    "Will the Eighth Route Army really come?"
    "The oriole is a spiritual bird, it doesn't talk nonsense. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, didn't it keep calling 'Down with Japan, kill the enemy, kill the enemy' when it saw something it didn't like? After calling for two years, it brought about the surrender of Japan."
    And so, they would start talking, one person saying that someone's son had been conscripted into the army again, another saying that the town head had called someone's daughter to help with "work"...
    In the end, everyone was worried that if the oriole kept calling for two years before the Eighth Route Army arrived, the people would not be able to survive, because Old Chiang was oppressing the people even more cruelly than the Japanese. But unexpectedly, just a few days after the beginning of autumn, the Eighth Route Army came to Jialing.
    The Eighth Route Army arrived at dawn. By the time the people found out, the villages around Jialing were all full of soldiers. The town head and the security regiment had run away with their tails between their legs.
    This army truly lived up to its reputation. It was very kind to the people, returning everything it borrowed, buying and selling fairly, and cleaning the houses and courtyards thoroughly.
    This army was truly strong and powerful, so exciting, so lovable! People gathered around the Eighth Route Army, talking about this and that, not wanting to work in the fields, not wanting to eat, and even no one paid attention to the calls of the oriole anymore.
    (Note) Both orioles and "kanbuchas" (a type of black bird) are small birds that sing well. They come from the south at the beginning of summer and leave after autumn. Orioles are yellow in color. Kanbuchas are black, with long forked tails.

    过八路
    解清
    “过八路，过八路”，立夏黄鹂（注）从南方来了，就成天这样叫，叫得多清楚，多嘹亮。
    贾岭镇（项城县属）一带的村庄都听到了这叫声。当保长不在跟前的时候，总有人停下手里的活，说：“这黄鹂叫的是啥事？叫得多好听”。“叫啥？叫过八路，过八路呵。叫了一夏天啦，你还没听见过，有时候它也叫杀光棍，杀光棍”（按当地老百姓称有钱有势，欺压百姓的人叫光棍）。也照例有人接着说两句：
    “八路军到底来不来呀？”
    “黄鹂这鸟是灵鸟呀，可不胡说乱道。抗日时候看不岔（注）不是叫打倒日本，杀敌，杀敌吗？叫了两年，就把个日本打投降了”。
    如此你一言我一语的就谈论起来了。这个人说谁家的儿子又被抓走当兵啦，那个人说某家的闺女被镇长叫去帮忙“做活”了……
    最后大家都一致耽心，要是黄鹂也叫两年八路才来，那老百姓都活不成了，因为老蒋苦害老百姓比日本人还厉害。可没想到立罢秋不几天，八路军就来到贾岭了。
    八路军是黎明时候来的，等老百姓知道了，贾岭这一片的村子都住得满满的。镇保长都跟保安团挟着尾巴跑了。
    这队伍真是名不虚传，待老百姓可和气，借啥东西还啥东西，公买公卖，把屋子，院子都打扫得干干净净的。
    这队伍真是兵强马壮，多叫人兴奋，多叫人喜欢呀！人们围着八路军转来转去，说这说那，地不想下，饭不想吃，甚至连黄鹂的叫声也没有人去理了。
    （注）黄鹂和看不岔都是善叫的小鸟，立夏从南方来，秋后走。黄鹂色黄。看不岔色黑，尾长而分岔。
