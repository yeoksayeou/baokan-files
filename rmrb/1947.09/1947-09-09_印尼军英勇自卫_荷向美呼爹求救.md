Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 5th: Batavia dispatch: The Indonesian army continues to wage heroic and tenacious resistance. In the past week, they have inflicted continuous blows on the invading enemy in various parts of Java, frustrating the Dutch offensives in Solo and Magelang in Central Java. The Dutch offensive in West Java has also met with strong resistance from the Indonesian army and people. Because the Indonesian people are adhering to a protracted war of self-defense, the Netherlands is greatly alarmed. On the one hand, it continues to transport war materials and troops to Indonesia for reinforcement. On the other hand, it does not hesitate to kowtow and cry to America for help, showing its extreme weakness and incompetence. According to Agence France-Presse, the Dutch ambassador to the United States declared on the 28th of last month: "The Netherlands will insist on demanding the minimum assistance from the United States under the Marshall Plan." Cleeffens even wagged his tail and begged US Deputy Secretary of State Lovett, saying, "As long as we can walk on our own, we will definitely not say: Daddy, carry me!"

　　印尼军英勇自卫
  　荷向美呼爹求救
    【新华社陕北五日电】巴达维亚讯：印尼军继续展开英勇顽强的阻击战，过去一周在爪哇各地予犯敌以不断打击，使荷军在爪哇中部的梭罗和马格朗的攻势受挫，荷军在西爪哇的进攻亦受到印尼军民的坚强抵抗，由于印尼人民坚持持久的自卫战，使荷兰大感恐慌，一面继续运送作战物资及军队赶赴印尼增援，一面不惜叩头呼爹向美国求救，显示其已极度软弱无能，据法新闻社讯，荷驻美大使于上月二十八日宣称：“荷兰将根据马歇尔计划坚持要求美国的最低援助”，克利芬斯竟向美国副国务卿罗维持摇尾乞怜说：“只要我们能自己走路的时候，我们就一定不会说：爸爸你带带我吧！”
