The examination covers individual performance in land reform over the past year, reflecting on the individual's ideological and material connections with the landlord class (including family, relatives, and various relationships). It is stipulated that the first week will be for individual reflection, collecting materials, and mutual inspiration; the second and third weeks will be for individual reflection reports and group discussions, unfolding debates, clarifying right and wrong, and making a summary for each person. After individual reflection, a major review of work over the past year will be conducted, openly discussing and exposing all facts that do not conform to the standpoint and the mass line, and formulating a plan to transform all work.
　　Furthermore: Concurrent with the examination of positions, the General Branch and the Taihang Branch are jointly studying the principle of establishing the communication network on the basis of poor peasant backbone, and are now collecting materials from various sources. Special personnel have been dispatched to Beiliu Village in Licheng and Wangjinzhuang in She County for field investigations and research, preparing to create experience during the review.
