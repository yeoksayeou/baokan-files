Important Announcement from the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region Government

　　Recently, some individuals have been impersonating this government, forging the government's official seal and travel permits, and engaging in reckless behavior in × place, deliberately undermining the government's authority. In addition to being punished according to law, from now on, regardless of who it is or what documents they carry, if they engage in illegal activities or their behavior is suspicious, they should be arrested and interrogated immediately. We hope that all military and government organs, militia sentries, will pay close attention to this matter! September 1st.
