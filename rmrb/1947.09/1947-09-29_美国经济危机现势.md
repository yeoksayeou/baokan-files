    The Current Situation of the American Economic Crisis
    1.  Unprecedented prosperity sows the seeds of disaster

    The American economy has generally experienced eight years of prosperity from 1939 to the present. During the war years, huge war needs and government orders guaranteed the unlimited expansion of production. During the war, American industrial production more than doubled, and heavy industrial production expanded more than two and a half times, twice the rate of the last World War:

    American Wartime Industrial Production Expansion Index Table - This table is quoted from Varga's "On Anglo-American Economic Relations"
    Year　　　　　Total Industry　　　　　Production Tools (including munitions)
    1941　　　　　　162　　　　　201
    1942　　　　　　199　　　　　273
    1943　　　　　　239　　　　　360
    1944　　　　　　238　　　　　353

    As soon as the war ended in 1945, American industrial production quickly fell from its wartime peak. However, due to the purchasing power accumulated by the American people during the war, the needs of capitalistic countries with insufficient production for American goods, and Germany's exit from the world trade market, American post-war production continued at a relatively high level:

    Year　　　　Total Industry　　　Durable Goods　　　Non-Durable Goods　　　　Minerals
    1945　　　　203　　　274　　　　166　　　137
    1946　　　　170　　　292　　　　163　　　138
    Dec. 1945　　161　　　284　　　　154　　　126
    Feb. 1946　　148　　　136　　　　162　　　134
    Oct. 1946　　182　　　214　　　　169　　　144
    Mar. 1947　　190　　　　——　　　　　——　　　　——

    (Note) The above two tables use the average of 1935-1939 as the base (100).

    From the above table, it can be seen that: (1) American post-war industrial production has dropped considerably, but has been trending upward since February 1946; (2) The drop in post-war production is mainly in the durable goods heavy industry sector, because this sector is most affected by the reduction in government military orders; (3) Post-war production continues to be at a higher level than before the war. Its production accounts for 60 percent of the current capitalist world production, while in 1929 it only accounted for 48 percent.

    The difference between American wartime prosperity and post-war prosperity lies in the fact that the latter is mainly built not on the expansion of production, but on the basis of rising prices. American monopoly capital has brazenly raised prices after the war, carrying out its monopoly price exploitation on domestic and foreign consumers, so that the post-war profits of monopoly capital have not only not decreased due to the reduction in production, but have instead created a deformed expansion. The wealth of the United States and even the entire capitalist world is rapidly flowing into the vaults of Wall Street:

    Table of Net Profits of American Companies During and After the War (After Tax) - Compiled based on the afternoon newspaper of December 16, 1945 and Xinhua News Agency dispatches
    Year　　　　　Actual Net Profit　　　　　Increase Multiple
    1940　　　　　7 billion yuan　　　　　212
    1941　　　　　9 billion yuan　　　　　272
    1942　　　　　10 billion yuan　　　　　303
    1943　　　　　11 billion yuan　　　　　333
    1944　　　　　10 billion yuan　　　　　303
    1945　　　　　9 billion yuan　　　　　272
    1946　　　　　15 billion yuan　　　　　454
    First Half of 1947　　　　　————　　　　　909

    (Note) This table uses the average of 1936 to 1939 as the base (100). The multiple for the first half of 1947 is estimated based on various telegrams. According to Citibank's August 1947 bulletin, the profits of 451 American companies in the first half of this year were 1.59 billion yuan, compared to only 790 million yuan in the same period last year.

    However, according to the periodic problems of capitalism, the higher the profits and the greater the expansion of production, the larger the gap between production and the market. Once the market shrinks and profits cannot be realized, a crisis will strike. The post-war prosperity of the United States, due to its nature of raising prices and exhausting the purchasing power of the domestic people, has an even greater danger in the seeds of disaster it breeds. In fact, American industrial production has not only crossed its wartime peak, but has also crossed its normal peak and begun to decline. The main reason for the decline is the shrinking of the domestic and international markets.
    
    2.  The Shrinking of the Domestic Market

    The American domestic market is now much smaller than it was at the end of the war, which will be the main condition for the arrival of the crisis (according to statistics from the Department of Commerce, domestic consumption in the United States accounted for about 64 percent of its total output in 1946). This is first reflected in the severe drop in workers' real wages due to soaring prices. Regarding the price increase, according to the very conservative figures released by the US Department of Labor, the average level in mid-June of this year was 157.1 compared to the average level of 1935-1939, that is, an increase of 57.1 percent. However, recent Agence France-Presse figures say that it has doubled. Based on the halving of the purchasing power of the dollar and the loss of half of the British loan, the price of American goods after the war has at least doubled. However, the increase in wages is far behind the increase in prices. According to the research results of economic expert Nathan, hired by the Federation of Industrial Organizations at the end of last year, American workers' real wages fell by 21 percent from January 1945 to October 1946. But in reality, workers' real wages fell by at least 30 percent in 1946 alone. In the first half of this year, workers' real wages fell by another 5 percent; From this, it can be seen that the actual wages of American workers have now fallen by at least 35 percent. (Note: The 30 percent drop in workers' real wages in 1946 is quoted from Allen's article on the American economic crisis in January of this year. The 5 percent drop in the first half of this year is quoted from the statistics of the Labor Research Association, that is, prices rose by 18 percent and wages increased by only 13 percent on average in the first half of this year.)

    Secondly, the wartime savings of the working people have been exhausted. Originally, the wartime savings of the workers were not much, and four-fifths of it was in the hands of capitalists. The savings were mainly in the form of war and victory bonds, totaling 147 billion yuan, of which only 20 billion were Class E small-denomination bonds that workers could purchase. But it is precisely these bonds that have been exchanged, indicating that the wartime savings of the broad masses have been exhausted.

    The shrinking of the domestic market is also reflected in the reduction of government orders. According to estimates by the Department of Commerce, government orders accounted for 42 percent of total US production in 1945, reduced to 19 percent in 1946, and will be reduced by another 60 percent in 1947 compared to 1946.

    Finally, the uneven distribution of national income in the United States is also a reason for the shrinking of the domestic market. The degree of this inequality is still developing. For example, the proportion of wages and salaries accounted for 72 percent of the national income in 1945, but dropped to 46 percent in 1946.

    The shrinking of the domestic market will inevitably lead to sluggish sales and increased inventories. According to Varga's recent estimate, US inventories have reached a huge amount of 37 billion yuan.

    3.  The Decline in Exports

    American exports during and after the war have expanded dramatically. The average export from 1935 to 1939 was 2.87 billion yuan, the import was 2.36 billion yuan, and the average trade surplus was 510 million yuan. During the war, due to the surge in exports, the trade surplus also increased rapidly, reaching 10.3 billion yuan in 1944. Last year, US exports were 15 billion yuan and the trade surplus was over 10 billion yuan. In the first half of this year, exports were 7.5 billion yuan and imports were 2.8 billion yuan. The trade surplus was 4.7 billion yuan. If exports maintain the current level, the trade surplus for the whole year will also be close to 10 billion yuan; adding about 3 billion yuan in US foreign investment and other labor service income, the deficit owed by the world to the United States will reach a huge 13 billion yuan annually.

    However, it should be emphasized that the expansion of American exports can only delay the arrival of the crisis to a certain extent, and cannot fundamentally solve the crisis problem. Last year, the total export was 15 billion yuan, accounting for only 7.3 percent of its total production value of 205 billion yuan. The Marshall Plan attempts to further expand exports by 5 billion yuan to 6 billion yuan annually, but it can only account for about 9.3 percent to 10 percent of the production value. According to Stassen's estimate in his conversation with Stalin, American exports cannot exceed 15 percent of its production in the future.

    More seriously, the current export level of the United States has encountered difficulties in maintaining it. The impoverished capitalist world, unable to balance the huge deficit of 13 billion yuan per year, has triggered a dollar shortage crisis. British Foreign Secretary Bevin's speech on September 3 also pointed out that 90 percent of the world's gold reserves are locked in the Federal Reserve Bank vaults at Fort Knox, a military fortress in Kentucky, and issued a roar for redistribution. According to the Department of Commerce, the total gold and dollars owned by the capitalist world was only 20 billion yuan at the beginning of this year. After decreasing by 1 billion yuan in the second quarter of this year, it is now only 19 billion yuan.

    The expansion of American exports is inseparable from its economic expansion policy. Harvard University economics professor Pierson pointed out in his book "The Role of the United States in the World Economy" that the United States is accustomed to "over-exporting" in international trade, and is accustomed to using methods such as dumping and gold devaluation to encourage exports and implement its policy of "turning neighbors into beggars." But the result of this policy will inevitably lead to countries that are unwilling to be beggars rising up to launch struggles to resist and limit the purchase of American goods, thereby shrinking the international market for American goods.

    The fact is that, due to the dollar crisis and the start of limiting the purchase of American goods by countries such as Britain, France, and Australia, American exports have experienced "the first major interruption." It fell by 13 percent in June compared to May, and fell more sharply by 19 percent in July, and the downward trend seems to be just beginning. This sharp drop in exports will greatly accelerate the arrival of the American economic crisis that is maturing.

    4.  The Beginning of Production Decline

    Under the shrinking of the domestic market and the decline in exports, American industrial production has been unable to maintain its original level and began to decline in April of this year:

    This Year's American Industrial Production Decline Index Table - Statistics from the Federal Reserve Board
    Month　　　　　Total Industry　　　　　Decline Index
    March　　　　　190　　　　　　——
    April　　　　　186　　　　　　4 percent
    May　　　　　185　　　　　　5 percent
    June　　　　　183　　　　　　7 percent
    July　　　　　178　　　　　　11 percent

    From this, it can be seen that American industrial production has been declining for four consecutive months, and is in a vertical decline. If a production drop of 10 percent is generally considered to be the beginning of a crisis, then this drop in American industrial production may indicate that the crisis has already begun. Of course, as Varga pointed out, "a more accurate determination will have to wait until later." But in any case, the post-war prosperity of the United States is over. "US News" magazine recently said: "Examining various factors, prosperity cannot be maintained, and it is feared that it will go downhill in the future."

    As for the degree of the impending American economic crisis - whether it is like the 1921 crisis (production fell by 18 percent) or the 1929 crisis (production fell by 46 percent)? It is still too early to offer a definite opinion now. But when considering this issue, two points are worth noting, namely, first, due to the concentration of American capital, the large output, and the high labor rate, the crisis is likely to become serious after it occurs; second, the economic crises and difficulties of capitalist countries led by Britain have already begun before the American economic crisis, which will play a major role in promoting and deepening the future American crisis.

    美国经济危机现势
    １、空前的景气种下了灾难的种子
    美国经济从三九年到现在，大体上已经历了八年的景气时期。在战争年代里，庞大的战争需要和政府定货，保证了生产的无限制扩张，战时美国工业生产增加了一倍以上，重工业生产更扩大了两倍半，增加的速度是上次世界大战时的二倍：

    四五年战争一结束，美国工业生产便从其战时高峰迅速跌落。但由于美国国内人民战时所积累起来的购买力，生产不足的资本主义各国对美货之需要，以及德国之退出世界贸易市场，使美国战后生产仍继续在相当高的水平之上：
    美战后工业生产消长指数表——联邦准备局统计年份　　　　全部工业　　　耐用品　　　非耐用品　　　　矿产四五年　　　　二○三　　　二七四　　　　一六六　　　一三七四六年　　　　一七○　　　二九二　　　　一六三　　　一三八四五十二月　　一六一　　　二八四　　　　一五四　　　一二六四六年二月　　一四八　　　一三六　　　　一六二　　　一三四四六年十月　　一八二　　　二一四　　　　一六九　　　一四四四七年三月　　一九○　　　　——　　　　　——　　　　——
    （注）以上两表以一九三五——三九年之平均数为基数（一○○）。
    由上表可以看出：（一）美国战后工业生产跌落颇多，但自四六年二月后，又趋上升；（二）战后生产之跌落主要是在耐用品重工业部门，因为这一部门受政府军事定货减少的影响最重；（三）战后生产仍继续在较战前为高之水平上。其生产占现在资本主义世界生产百分之六十，而一九二九年则只占百分之四十八。
    美国战时景气与战后景气的不同，在于后者主要不是建筑在生产扩大，而是在物价高涨的基础上。美独占资本战后放肆地抬高物价，对国内外消费者实行其独占价格的超额剥削，因此独占资本的战后利润不但未因生产之缩小而减少，反而更造成畸形膨胀之势。美国全国乃至全资本主义世界的财富，都急剧地流到华尔街的金库里：
    美国各公司战时战后纯利（抽税后）表——根据一九四五年十二月十六日下午报及新华社电讯编成年　份　　　　　纯利实数　　　增加倍数四○年　　　　　七○亿元　　　　二一二四一年　　　　　九○亿元　　　　二七二四二年　　　　一○○亿元　　　　三○三四三年　　　　一一○亿元　　　　三三三四四年　　　　一○○亿元　　　　三○三四五年　　　　　九○亿元　　　　二七二四六年　　　　一五○亿元　　　　四五四四七年上半年　　————　　　　九○九
    （注）此表以一九三六至三九年之平均数为基数（一○○）。四七年上半年之倍数系根据各方电讯估计。据花旗银行四七年八月份公报，美今年上半年四五一家公司的利润是十五亿九千万元，去年同期仅七亿九千万元。
    然而，依照资本主义的周期毛病，利润愈高，生产愈扩大，则生产与市场间的缺口也愈大，一旦市场缩小，利润不能实现，危机便袭来了。美国战后景气由于其抬高物价绞尽国内人民购买力的性质，它所孕育着的灾难种子，危险性就更大。事实上，美工业生产不但已越过其战时顶点，而且已越过其平时顶点，开始下降了。下降的主要原因，便是国内市场与国际市场的缩小。
  ２、国内市场的缩小
    美国国内市场现在较战争结束时是大大缩小了，这将是促使危机到来的主要条件（根据商务部的统计，四六年美国内消费量约占其总产量百分之六十四），这首先表现在工人实际工资由于物价飞涨而造成之严重跌落。关于物价上涨情形，据美劳工部公布的极保守的数字，今年六月中旬为三五至三九年平均水平的一五七点一，即是说，涨了百分之五十七点一，但最近法新社的数字则说是涨了一倍，根据美元购买力贬低一半和英国贷款损失一半等情况判断，美国战后物价至少涨了一倍。但工资的增加却远落在物价之后。据产业工会联合会去年年底聘请经济专家纳森氏研究结果，美工人实际工资自四五年一月到四六年十月，跌了百分之二十一，但实际上，工人实际工资仅四六年即至少跌了百分之三十，今年上半年，工人实际工资又跌落了百分之五；由此可见，美劳工实际工资现在至少是跌了百分之三十五。（注：四六年工人实际工资跌百分之三十，引自爱伦今年一月论美国经济危机一文。今年上半年跌百分之五，是引劳工研究协会的统计，即今年上半年物价上涨百分之十八，工资平均只增加百分之十三。）
    其次，是战时劳动人民储蓄的耗尽。本来劳工的战时储蓄就不多，它的五分之四都握在资本家手中，储蓄的形式主要是战争与胜利公债，共达一四七○亿元，其中只有二○○亿是Ｅ类小股债券，是劳工所能购买的，但正是这类公债，去年已被兑换一空，表示广大群众的战时储蓄业已耗尽。
    国内市场之缩小还表现在政府定货之减少。据商务部估计，政府定货四五年占全美生产的百分之四十二，四六年减至百分之十九，四七年较四六年将更减少百分之六十。
    最后，美国国民收入分配之不均，也是国内市场萎缩的一个原因。这种不均的程度，现在仍在加剧发展。例如工资与薪水比例四五年占全国收入的百分之七十二，四六年即降至百分之四十六。
    国内市场之缩小，必然形成销售的呆滞，与存货的增多。据瓦尔加最近的估计，美存货已达到三百七十亿元的巨额了。
  ３、输出的下降
    美国战时与战后的输出有急剧的扩大。三五至三九年的平均输出是二十八亿七千万元，输入是二十三亿六千万元，平均出超是五亿一千万元。战时，由于输出激增出超也迅速上涨，四四年即达一○三亿元。去年美输出一五○亿元出超在一百亿元以上。今年上半年输出七十五亿元，输入二十八亿元。出超四十七亿元。如果输出维持现在水平，则全年出超亦将及百亿元；加上美国在外投资与其他劳务收入约三十亿元，则全世界欠美国的赤字将年达一三○亿元之巨。
    但应当强调指出，美输出之扩大只能在某种程度上延缓危机的到来，不能根本解决危机问题。去年总输出是一五○亿元，只占其生产总值二○五○亿元的百分之七·三，马歇尔计划企图每年再扩大输出五○亿元至六○亿元，但也只能占生产总值百分之九·三至百分之十左右。照史塔生在与斯大林谈话中所估计的，美国今后输出不可能超过其生产的百分之十五。
    更严重的是，美国现在的输出水平已发生维持不了的困难。贫困化了的资本主义世界，因无法平衡每年一三○亿元的巨大赤字，而爆发了美元缺乏的危机。英外相贝文九月三日的演说，也指出世界黄金准备百分之九十都被锁在肯塔基州陆军要塞诺克斯堡的联邦准备银行金库中，而发出重新分配的吼声。资本主义世界所拥有的全部黄金及美元，据商务部的统计，今年年初只有二百亿元，在今年第二季又减少十亿元之后，现在只有一百九十亿元了。
    美国输出之扩大是与其经济扩张政策分不开的，哈佛大学经济学教授皮森在其“美国在世界经济中之作用”一书中指出，美国在国际贸易上惯于“输出过多”，惯于以倾销、金元贬值等办法，鼓励输出，实行其“变邻国为乞丐”的政策。但这种政策的结果，终必引起不愿做乞丐的国家，起来掀起抵制与限购美货的斗争，从而缩小美货的国际市场。
    事实是，由于美元危机和英、法、澳等国的开始限购美货，美国输出已发生“首次重大的中断”。六月份较五月份跌了百分之十三，七月份更猛跌百分之十九，而且跌落趋势似正方兴未艾。这种输出的剧跌。势将大大加速正在成熟中的美国经济危机的到来。
  ４、生产跌落的开始
    在国内市场缩小与输出下降之下，美国的工业生产已不能维持其原来水平而于今年四月开始下降了：
    今年美国工业生产跌落指数表——联邦准备局统计月份　　　　全部工业　　　　跌落指数三月　　　　　一九○　　　　　　——四月　　　　　一八六　　　　百分之四五月　　　　　一八五　　　　百分之五六月　　　　　一八三　　　　百分之七七月　　　　　一七八　　　　百分之十一
    由此可见，美国工业生产已连续跌了四个月，而且是在垂直下降中。如果一般以生产跌落百分之十即可算危机开始的话，那么美国工业生产的这种跌落，可能表明危机已经开始。当然，正如瓦尔加所指出的“更确切的断定，要等到稍后才行”。但无论如何，美国战后景气已经完结。“美国新闻”周刊最近也说：“考查各种因素，景气已不能维持，今后恐怕要走下坡路了。”
    至于迫近的美国经济危机的程度如何——是一九二一年式的（生产跌百分之十八）还是一九二九年式的（生产跌百分之四十六）？现在要提出确定的意见尚属过早。但在考虑这个问题时，有两点是值得注意的，即第一，由于美国资本之集中，产量之大，劳动率之高，危机发生后，容易趋向于严重；第二，以英国为首的资本主义国家的经济危机与困难，已经先美国的经济危机而开始了，这对于促进和加深美国未来的危机，将起重大的作用。
