　　【Changzhi Dispatch from this Newspaper】Last month, on the afternoon of the 13th, in the new district's Purple Village of the First District, groups of cadres and villagers went from field to field, visiting each other's crops to see whose autumn harvest was better. Ma Leicheng, due to ideological issues, was unwilling to hoe diligently, so his good land grew yellow sorghum resembling "foxtails." Ma Hailin and Ma Qizun's three plots of land grew dark green and lush, better than they had ever grown before. Qizun said, "This year, mutual aid hoeing was done three times to achieve this growth. It's really worth the effort!" He couldn't stop smiling. Chang Shui's one and a half mu of garden land, after diligent work, grew exceptionally well. This year, he harvested three seasons: garlic, scallions, and cabbage, each selling for 100,000 [currency units]. Ji Panghu's hillside land was hoed three times and grew as tall as the land on the plain, with large sorghum ears. Ma Sanfu's three mu of land, newly allocated this year, grew excellent corn. Everyone walked and talked, saying, "The labor was truly worthwhile, and mutual aid groups are really useful! Could it have grown this well without mutual aid!" They couldn't bear to leave the crops, happily saying, "The people have turned over, and so has the land!" Before this, livestock and textiles were competing fiercely in the streets. Eighty-five animals, fully tethered in a large arena, drew crowds of men and women as if attending a fair, cheerfully evaluating and pointing. After watching and comparing, each group started discussions. "Is mutual aid good or not?" Ma Qizun said, "This year, with mutual aid, the entire village saved 1,600 workdays just on weeding. In the past, we always hired people to weed our village, and there was still wasteland. This year, there wasn't a single mu of wasteland, and the 761 mu of sorghum were weeded three times, with two-thirds of the corn weeded three times. The garden land has no weeds and has yielded three harvests. Could we have done this without mutual aid?" Gen Xiao said, "Mutual aid has greatly benefited me. My old man is sixty-five years old, and in the past, planting and harvesting were always late every year. This year, participating in mutual aid, the work is faster, and the sorghum was weeded three times, growing into good crops!" Wu Cun then said, "Our group has 219 mu of land and twenty-one households. The land was weeded three times, saving 204 workdays. Transport purchased six animals, and the mill earned 150,000 [currency units]. Don't you think mutual aid is good?" Everyone said, "Everyone benefits from mutual aid!" Next, fifteen model workers, including Ma Qizun, were selected, and each household received a production model plaque, greatly boosting the production enthusiasm of the entire village. The mutual aid groups were reorganized, combining voluntarily. Twenty-six groups became twenty-three groups, and everyone in the village, except for eight target households of struggle, were combined. Currently, the entire village is carrying out a manure collection campaign. There were originally ninety mu of wheat fields, and this year, they will expand by seventy mu, reclaiming thirty mu of wasteland.
