Having made a mistake, correct it immediately
Taiyue Branch Office Calls
An'yi News Was Wrong

[Report from our newspaper] The Taiyue Branch Office, due to errors in the An'yi manuscript, has sent a telegram to the head branch office for correction and self-criticism. The original telegram is as follows: “Urgent: Head Branch Office: The article on the famine in An'yi published on the 12th (appearing on page 2 of this newspaper on the 14th) was a mistake; it concerned Tunliu. The branch office has conducted a self-criticism for this error, which was not only careless but also a case of mistaken identity. Firstly, the comrade in the liaison department registered the manuscript incorrectly, mistakenly registering Tunliu as An'yi. When the editor was processing the manuscript, doubts arose. The current focus of work in An'yi is land reform, so the comrade from the transportation department investigated and insisted it was An'yi. The editor still suspected that even if there was famine relief, there couldn't be such great achievements. But they only focused on the significant propaganda value of this manuscript and proceeded with editing. For the sake of 'completeness' and 'rushing,' they casually added that famine relief was being carried out simultaneously, and that the wasteland created during the enemy and puppet regime was being completely eliminated. It wasn't until yesterday afternoon that we received a small newspaper from Tunliu and discovered the methods for famine relief described therein, which, upon comparison, turned out to be from Tunliu. Therefore, this time there was a problem. On the one hand, it was carelessness; on the other hand, there was insufficient spirit of seriousness and responsibility in the work, and we even added unnecessary details." (Taiyue Branch Office, 10th)

    有了错误马上检讨
    太岳分社来电
    安邑新闻错了
    【本报讯】太岳分社因安邑稿子理有误，特电总分社作更正，并作自我检讨，原电如下：“急：总分社：十二日（刊于十四日本报二版）所发安邑灾荒一稿，系屯留之误，分社为此作了检讨，不仅是粗枝大叶，又犯了“客里空”。首先此稿由通联科同志登记错了，误将屯留登记为安邑，当时编辑处理此稿时曾发生怀疑，安邑目前工作中心为土地改革，即交通部科同志调查，他们坚持是安邑，编辑仍怀疑即是有灭荒决不能有如此大的成绩，但只注意到这一稿件对外宣传作用甚大，即着手编辑。为“圆满”与“突击”就随便加上了同时进行灭荒，把敌伪统治时期造成的荒地消灭干净。直至昨日下午接到了屯留小报，发现了上面有灭荒的办法，对照后原来就是屯留的。所以这次出了毛病，一面是粗枝大叶，另一面是对工作上严肃负责的精神不够，还随便添枝加叶。”（太岳分社十日）
