Southward! Overthrow Chiang Kai-shek!

    The Wu'an County Party Committee recently called on district and village cadres to cross the Yellow River southward to support the front lines and mobilize the masses in the Chiang-controlled areas. In Berlin Village, Seventh District alone, seven people volunteered to go. Because there were too many, one was persuaded to stay in the village, and two more were persuaded to stay at the county level.

    Guo Zonghua, forty years old, said to the responsible comrade in the county who was trying to dissuade him: "It's not like I have to be a cadre all the time. I can go to the South and cook, feed horses, and do odd jobs!" He is a stubborn man who "would rather break than bend." He speaks loudly. Some time ago, he supported the front in Anyang and earned a first-class merit in mobilizing the masses in the war zone, without taking any outside wealth. This time, upon hearing the news of the great counter-offensive, he immediately signed up to go south: "I have no worries at all, let me sign up first!" He told his wife: "You don't have to worry about anything, just take care of the children." Another person who was dissuaded was Li Jiansheng, a twenty-four-year-old youth. Like Guo Zonghua, he felt ashamed and disappointed when told not to go: "People are sending us off with gongs and drums, it's a moment of glory, what will it look like to go back?" Returning from the county to the district, he kept complaining until the district promised them, "Next time we transfer people, we'll give priority to you," and only then did they return to the village. "Going south, going south, it's really hard to go south!" they sighed.

    Coming out and then going back is indeed too disappointing. If you look at the scene of the masses in Berlin sending these people off to the south, you will understand why this feeling is inevitable.

    When the masses in West Berlin and Front Berlin heard that Zhu Qichang, Liu Chengyong, Guo Zonghua, and others had signed up to go south to participate in the great counter-offensive and overthrow Chiang Kai-shek, they immediately sent 300 or 500 yuan for travel expenses, cigarettes, handkerchiefs, and leather bags. For travel expenses alone, Front Berlin sent 60,000 yuan, and West Berlin sent 50,000 yuan. When the cadres said, "Don't be too wasteful," the gift-giving stopped, but they still competed to invite those going south to their homes for dinner. Cadres and those who signed up in Upper Berlin dissuaded the masses from offering dinners, but the travel expenses reached 90,000 yuan. This was also stopped halfway. Retired soldier Pei Kuiyuan gave his military uniform to those going south, saying: "When you see this uniform, it's like seeing me; I was disabled fighting Chiang Kai-shek and can't go. You continue the fight, the enemy in the South is very weak, I know." A woman gave the departing soldiers two pairs of newly made shoes, telling them to "change into them when it rains."

    After a farewell meeting with men, women, old and young in the whole village, they beat gongs and drums to see them off out of the village. The departing could not be persuaded to turn back, all the way to more than half a mile south of the village, where they gave a final word of encouragement on the edge of a field ridge: "Don't worry about anything at home, don't be controlled by anyone, work hard, overthrow Chiang Kai-shek and have a great reunion." The departing stood on the field ridge and expressed to the whole village once again: "Revolutionize well, we won't return to Berlin until Chiang Kai-shek is overthrown."

    There are good reasons why these people are so willing to go south and why the masses are so enthusiastic in sending them off. Take Guo Zonghua, for example: during the Kuomintang rule, he had not a single room or plot of land. For most of his life, he either rented land or worked as a temporary worker, picking up scraps and chopping wood to make a living. Now, he not only has more than ten mu of land and a house, but also a donkey, a wife, and children. And the masses all know and remember: in the Chiang Kai-shek era, especially in the early years of the War of Resistance, there were a dozen "commanders" from Chiang's family living in Berlin alone. Even ten soldiers could be counted as a large team, directly levying grain and money and dispatching labor in the village. The local landlords Wang Songshan, Liu Tingkui, Liu Dezhi, and others, relying on the power of the Chiang family, arbitrarily raped women, cursed and beat people, sold shoddy flour, collected rent and conscripted labor with guns, and people had to do it even on an empty stomach. If the masses hadn't been quickly driven away, they would have all died. The evil landlords Wang, Liu, etc., all followed Chiang's army to take "official" positions. What about the masses? When they mention Chiang Kai-shek, they hate him as much as they hate these thugs. Some time ago, when the militiamen went to Anyang to participate in the war, the masses told them to "capture Wang Songshan, Liu Tingkui, and that gang of dog commanders and bring them back for public trial." This time, they are going south to overthrow Chiang Kai-shek and eradicate the root of the evil. Who wouldn't be happy and jump for joy?!

    Li Jiansheng's mother was a little sad. Others advised her: "Just think of it as your child running off to Guanwai for two more years. But you couldn't turn yourself around by going to Guanwai, this time you have to turn yourself around completely!" His father said: "We used to go to Guanwai, afraid of the rich people stopping us to demand debts, not even daring to see people; now the masses are sending us off with gongs and drums, what more glory could we want!" "We've endured all kinds of hardships, what's this!" Zhu Qichang's mother was a little sad, but his twenty-one-year-old young wife said to him: "What am I afraid of when he's gone!"

    The will to "Go South and overthrow Chiang Kai-shek!" has replaced people's ordinary feelings of separation. This united strength will be completely irresistible to Chiang Kai-shek and his American masters.

    南下，打倒蒋介石！
    武安县委最近号召区村干部渡黄河南下，支援前线，发动蒋区群众，光七区柏林村就有七个人自动报名前去。因为太多，在村里就劝回去一个，到县里又劝回来两个。
    四十岁的郭宗华，在县里负责同志劝阻他时说：“我又不是总得做干部哩，到南边做饭喂马干啥杂活也行嘛！”他是一个“宁折不‘克的’（弯）”的大脾气人，说话一片声响，前些时在安阳支援前线，发动战地群众中立过头等功，没抓过一点外财。这次听到大反攻消息，马上报名南下：“我啥顾虑也没有，叫我先报！”他告诉他老婆：“你啥也不用结记，把小孩打置好就行。”另一被劝阻的人叫李建生，是一个二十四岁的青年，也和郭宗华一样，一说不叫去就觉得丢了人败了兴：“人家锣鼓喧天欢送出来，光荣了一场，回去象个啥？”从县回到区，还是叨叨不休一直到区里答应他们“下次再调人先尽你们去”，这才回村。“南下南下，真是难下！”他们叹息着。
    出来再回去，确实是太扫兴了，请看一下柏林群众欢送这些人离村南下时的情景，你就会想到这种心理是必然的。
    西柏林和前柏林群众一听到朱其昌、刘成勇、郭宗华等报名南下是要参加大反攻，打倒蒋介石，马上就三百元五百元的送路费，送纸烟、手巾、皮包，光路费一项，前柏林送了六万，西柏林送了五万。在干部说到“不可太浪费”时，送礼停止了，却又争着拉南下者到家里吃饭。上柏林干部与报名人劝阻了群众的请吃饭，路费却送到九万元。这也是半路止住的。退伍军人裴奎元把他带回来的一身军衣送给南下者说：“你们看见这衣服，就和看见我一样；我为打蒋介石残废了，不能去了，你们接着干吧，南边敌人空虚得很，我知道。”一个女人把刚做好的两双鞋送给了出征者，叫他们“下了雨换着穿”。
    全村男女老幼开过欢送大会之后，又大敲锣鼓出村欢送，出发者劝也劝不回去，一直到村南半里多，又在一个地堰边最后一次叮嘱出发者：“一点不用结记家，家里一点不受制、好好工作，打倒蒋介石大团圆。”出发者站在地堰上再次向全村表示：“好好革命，打不倒蒋介石不回柏林。”
    这些人这样乐意南下，以及群众如此热烈欢送，是有充份理由的。就说郭宗华吧：国民党统治时期房无一间，地无一垄，半生多不是租地，就是当短工，拾砍渡日，现在不仅有了十来亩地和房子，还有了驴，娶了老婆，生了孩子。而群众也都知道、都记得：蒋介石时代，特别是抗战初年，蒋家光住在柏林的“司令”就有十来个，有十个兵也可以算个大队，直接在村派粮款、派差。村中大地主王松山、刘廷魁、刘得志等仗着蒋家威势，任意奸淫妇女，骂人打人卖料面、提着手枪收租拉差，饿着肚也得干哩。如果说群众还没跑完死完，就是因为他们很快被赶跑了。王、刘等恶霸地主、都跟着蒋军坐“官”去了。群众呢？一提到蒋介石就象提到这些恶棍一样，恨得咬牙。前些时民兵到安阳参战，群众就嘱咐他们“把王松山、刘廷魁和那伙狗司令们捉回来公审”。这次南下要打倒蒋介石、拔除老祸根了，谁不高兴得直跳？！
    李建生家娘有些难过，别人劝她：“就当成孩子再跑两年关外吧。可是，到关外翻不了身，这回可要彻底翻身了！”父亲说：“咱以前去关外，怕人家老财拦住要帐，连人都不敢见；现在群众打上锣鼓欢送咱，还要怎光荣哩！”“咱啥苦也吃过了，这算啥呀！”朱其昌家娘有点难过，二十一岁的年轻媳妇对他说：“他走了，有我怕啥！”
    “南下，打倒蒋介石”的意志代替了人们平常的离情别绪，这种众志成城的力量，将是蒋介石和他的美国老子完全不能抗拒的。
