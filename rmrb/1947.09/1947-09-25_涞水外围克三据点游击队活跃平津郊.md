Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, September 22nd: From September 6th to 8th, a portion of our local armed forces in western Hebei successively captured three enemy strongholds on the periphery of Laishui city: Shigezhuang, Xiaxinzhuang, and Wenxinzhuang, destroying more than twenty pillboxes, capturing forty-seven enemy soldiers, killing or wounding more than sixty, and seizing two machine guns and twenty-nine rifles.

Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, September 23rd: Guerrilla warfare is active in the suburbs of Beijing and Tianjin. The Wanliang (newly established county combining parts of Wanping and Liangxiang) Revenge Detachment, operating deep in the KMT-controlled areas, had, by August 15th, completely destroyed all the puppet "Joint Defense Villages" in the villages under Wanping's jurisdiction south of Beijing, killing or wounding fifty enemy soldiers. The Jinwu (newly established county combining parts of Tianjin and Wuqing) Work Team captured two enemy vehicles and twelve enemy soldiers on the Wang (Qingtuo) Shuang (kou) highway west of Tianjin and north of Shenglai, seizing a batch of documents. They also drove out puppet bandits from the strongholds of Sanguangxia and Yupokou north of Wangqingtuo.

Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, September 22nd: The People's Armed Forces Department of the Jin-Cha-Ji Military Region recently issued a commendation to the militias of Baxian, Guan, Jinwu, and Shengfang for their persistence in guerrilla warfare north of the Daqing River and their outstanding achievements. From August 8th to 15th of last month, the militias of these four counties annihilated a total of 400 KMT bandits, forcing the bandits to remain isolated in their strongholds. During this period, the Baxian militia fought thirteen independent battles, killing, wounding, or capturing seventy-four enemy soldiers, and forcing the bandits from the North and South Mengzhen of the county to retreat, preventing the enemy troops occupying Baxian city from expanding and establishing strongholds. The Jinwu militia twice foiled the "encirclement and suppression" operations of enemy puppet forces of two regiments or more in the Liutang and Erli areas. The Guan and Shengfang militias extensively used landmine warfare, preventing the enemy troops in Shengfang and other places from venturing out to harass and plunder grain.
