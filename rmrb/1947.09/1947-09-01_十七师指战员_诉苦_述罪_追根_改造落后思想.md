　　Seventeenth Division Commanders and Fighters:
　　Pour Out Grievances, Confess Sins, Trace Roots
　　Transforming Backward Thinking
　　[This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch, 30th] The Seventeenth Division of the 38th Army of the Northwest Democratic Allied Army launched a "Pour Out Grievances," "Confess Sins," "Trace Roots," and "Enter the Roll of Honor" movement to raise the class consciousness of commanders and fighters. The pervasiveness and depth of this movement is unprecedented. Even the so-called "dead corners" of administrative personnel and cadres from landlord backgrounds have been drawn into this movement. It has four characteristics: First, having learned from previous experiences of pouring out grievances, cadres are truly playing a leading role in the movement, driving the soldiers into the upsurge. Second, after in-depth mobilization, commanders and fighters from landlord backgrounds launched the "Confess Sins" movement. Most cadres with high political awareness openly confessed and exposed the crimes of their families in oppressing and exploiting the poor. Comrade Liu Jimin, head of the communications section, was one of the best in "Confessing Sins," which enlightened the soldiers and caused some soldiers from hired peasant backgrounds to pour out all their grievances. Third, it united people from middle peasant backgrounds. By pouring out grievances and tracing roots, they initially said, "We haven't suffered much exploitation, nor have we exploited anyone. We don't have any grievances to pour out, nor sins to confess." After using accounting methods to find grievances, they realized that middle peasants in the Jiang-controlled areas had suffered from conscription, levies, and heavy tax oppression, and only then did they recognize that Jiang Z贼 (literally "Jiang thief", a term of abuse for Chiang Kai-shek) was their enemy, and clarified their class stance. Finally, after digging out the roots of suffering, the "Enter the Roll of Honor" movement was launched through ideological examination and resolution examination. Each person's resolutions and plans were discussed and reviewed by the masses to see if they were true or false, and if they were true, they were entered into the Roll of Honor. Fourth, the inspection was very detailed. For example, Liu Chengshan, a fighter in the 2nd Machine Gun Company, said while on guard duty at night, "I can go home without a travel permit." When it was discovered that he had thoughts of going home, he was not allowed to enter the Roll of Honor and underwent further ideological reflection. Those who were not qualified to enter the Roll of Honor were given a "probationary period," the length of which was determined according to the situation. Those who performed well during the probationary period could be entered into the Roll of Honor in advance. This kind of checking of thoughts and resolutions, like rectification and appraisal, has greatly transformed the backward thinking in the troops.

　　十七师指战员
  　诉苦·述罪·追根
  　改造落后思想
    【本报太岳三十日电】西北民主联军三十八军十七师，为提高指战员阶级觉悟，全军掀起了“诉苦”、“述罪”、“追根”与“上光荣簿”运动。此次运动的普遍深入，为空前未有。向来所谓“死角”的事务人员，地主成份的干部，同样卷入了这一运动。其特点有四：首先是接受了历次的诉苦经验，干部在运动中，真正起带头作用，推动战士卷入热潮。其次，地主成份出身的指战员，经过深入动员后，展开了“述罪”运动，大部政治觉悟高的干部，均当众坦白和揭发了自己家庭压迫剥削穷人的罪恶，通讯股长刘纪民同志，是“述罪”中最好的一个，由此启发了战士，使一些雇贫农出身的战士，倒尽了苦水。第三是团结了中农成份出身的人，诉苦刨根，开始他们说：“咱没受过甚剥削，也没剥削过人，没有啥苦诉，也没有罪述。”经用算帐方式找苦，找出中农在蒋管区被征兵、征款受尽捐税压榨，才认清了蒋贼是自己的仇人，明确了阶级立场。最后在刨苦根后，由思想检查、决心检查中，展开了上光荣簿运动，各人的决心计划由群众讨论检讨，看是真是假，真的就上光荣簿。第四检查非常细致，如某个机二连战士刘成山，晚上站岗时说：“我不要路条能回家。”被查到有回家思想，就不能上光荣簿，再进行思想反省。没资格上光荣簿者，给以“候补期”，日期依情况决定，在候补期表现好的，可提前上光荣簿。这种查思想查决心和整风鉴定一样，大大改造了部队中的落后思想。
