　　Using Grievances to Resolve Ideological Problems
  　A Report on Learning Experiences at the Military University
    Mei Cun
  　I. From Sympathizing with Landlords to Venting Grievances
    The trainees in the Fourth Squad of the First Detachment were all squad and platoon-level cadres from the 38th Army and various columns. After a week of "exposing thoughts," it was discovered that their prevalent thinking was: sympathizing with landlords, believing that struggling against landlords was wrong; missing their wives and fearing death, and these two were combined into homesickness; and still holding some dissatisfaction with the revolutionary troops…
    After studying the situation, the leadership believed that the key to the ideological problem lay in sympathizing with landlords, and a blurred class consciousness. The thoughts of missing their wives, fearing death, and homesickness all stemmed from this. As long as this main problem was solved, the remaining problems would be resolved without effort.
    How can this problem be solved? According to the experience of the school's two pre-education periods, the best way is still to carry out a class grievance-venting movement.
    At the beginning, we first gave topics and asked everyone to have discussions: Should landlords be struggled against? Are there good people among the landlords?… As preparation for the grievance-venting.
    At this time, several people, in the discussion, recalled the past and tearfully vented their grievances in the class. Therefore, we seized this opportunity to find the one who vented the best and made a model report to lead the way. Then, the cadres went separately to find comrades from poor backgrounds, talked to them individually, enlightened and guided them to recognize and recall the oppression and exploitation they had suffered in the past, and encouraged them to boldly vent their grievances. And according to the ideological mood of the detachment, the possible situations, and timely proposed slogans, such as: "People don't shed tears unless they are heartbroken, tell your bitterness to a confidant!" "Pour out every drop, the suffering of the poor cannot be exhausted!" "Other people's suffering is our own suffering, listen to others, think about yourself!" "Pour out the bitter water and recognize the enemy!"... After these steps, the tide of grievance-venting was set off!
    II. When the Bitter Water is Poured Out, the Eyes Become Clear.
    Many comrades were venting while crying, telling about the painful exploitation and oppression they had suffered from landlords in the past.
    For example, Comrade Zhao Tianxun said: "My family was in western Henan. In a year of famine, I was a soldier away from home. The landlord secretly sold my wife and sister to a big tyrant. My wife became the tyrant’s first wife, and my sister became his concubine!..."
    A comrade from western Henan said: "The landlord exploited my family and made us poor. Sixteen members of the family starved to death, leaving only me. I herded sheep for the landlord. The landlord broke my head with a stone, and I almost got killed by him!..."
    Comrade Xu Zhian said: "The landlord got my father drunk with wine, dismembered him into eighteen pieces, and raped and occupied my mother, aunt, and sister. Later, he forced my mother to death!..."
    Some people who vented grievances cried until they lost their breath; some cried and fell to the ground, passing out... The listeners, regardless of cadres, classmates, or staff, were all tearful.
    After such a venting, the confused understanding of the landlords was corrected. Some even gritted their teeth and said: "Now I understand that landlords should not only be fought against, but also killed!" "Kill them all! A thousand cuts and ten thousand scrapes cannot compensate for the lives of the peasants!" "I can't wait to bite them a few times!" "When I go back, even if it's my own uncle, I will peel off a few layers of his skin!" The leadership also guided everyone to understand the policy that the landlord class cannot be physically eliminated, and everyone also admitted it. However, from then on, everyone's eyes became clear, and everyone said: "All crows under heaven are black, there are no good landlords!"...
    III. We Will Not Go Home Until Chiang Kai-shek is Eliminated
    After everyone vented their grievances, they traced the root of the bitterness to the landlords; further, they traced it to Chiang Kai-shek, who is the root of the landlord class, and the hatred deepened. Everyone wanted to take revenge on the landlord class and on Chiang Kai-shek! To thoroughly eliminate the landlord class, and the old root of the landlord, Chiang Kai-shek, in order to liberate themselves, and even all Chinese compatriots who are oppressed and exploited like themselves, and completely turn themselves over.
    Therefore, in their letters to the school leaders and detachment leaders, they unanimously expressed: "We have recognized who the class enemy is, and we are determined to fight to the end for the revolution under the banner of the Party and Chairman Mao! ...In battle, we must show the spirit of sacrificing ourselves for the Party and the people!"
    The thoughts of fearing death, missing wives, and homesickness all vanished, replaced by a single shared thought and will: "We will not go home until Chiang Kai-shek is eliminated."
    IV. The Passionate Shouts
    After venting grievances, not only did their eyes become clear, but a new spirit was also焕发起来 (a difficult concept to translate directly - 'radiated' or 'blossomed'). Many comrades let out passionate shouts:
    Zhang Baogui, who used to have complaints about the Party and did not work hard, cried loudly after venting his grievances: "Mother! You died so bitterly! ...Now, the Communist Party is my own mother! ...I didn't work hard in the past, I didn't avenge you properly, I'm really sorry for you...!"
    Lu Jingwen also cried loudly and said: "Mother! (His mother was forced to death by the landlord) I didn't work hard in the past, I didn't want to study, everyone else was working, but I just didn't want to do it! ...I'm sorry for you!..." He cried until he fainted four times.
    Xu Zhian, recalling that he had embezzled 80,000 yuan of public funds in the front, fell to the ground, pounding his chest with his fists, and frantically scratching the ground with both hands, banging his head everywhere, crying from day to midnight, repeatedly shouting: "Mother! I'm sorry for you! Party, I'm sorry for you!..."

　　用诉苦解决思想问题
  　军大学习经验报导
    梅村
  　一、由同情地主到诉苦
    一大队四队的学员，都是三十八军及各纵队来的班排级干部。经过一周的“暴露思想”，发现他们普遍的思想是：同情地主，认为斗争地主不应该；想老婆，怕死，二者又结合成为想家；对革命部队还多少有点不满……
    领导上研究后，认为思想关键，在于同情地主，阶级觉悟模糊；想老婆，怕死，想家等思想，都是从这里来的。只要解决了这个主要问题，其余问题，便不攻自破了。
    怎样才能解决这个问题呢？根据学校两期预料教育的经验，最好的办法，还是开展阶级诉苦运动。
    开始，我们先出题目，叫大家坐谈：地主该斗不该斗？地主中间有没有好人？……作为诉苦的酝酿准备。
    这时有几个人，在座谈中，引起了过去的回忆，痛哭流涕的在班里诉起苦来。于是，我们抓紧这个机会，找诉得最好的，作示范报告带头。接着干部又分头找出身贫苦的同志，个别谈话，启发、诱导他们认识和回忆过去所受的压迫剥削，鼓励他们大胆诉苦。并根据队上的思想情绪，可能发生的情况，及时提出口号，如：“人不伤心不落泪，有苦诉给知心人！”“有一碗，倒一碗，穷人苦楚诉不完！”“人家的苦，就是自己的苦，听听人家，想想自己！”“倒净苦水，认清敌人！”……经过这些步骤后，诉苦的浪潮，便掀起来了！
    二、苦水倒出来，眼睛明亮了。
    许多同志，都是边哭边诉的，诉出了自己过去受过地主惨痛的剥削与压迫。
    如赵天训同志说：“我家在豫西，灾荒年，我当兵在外，地主把我老婆，妹妹，偷偷的卖给一个大恶霸，我老婆当了人家的大婆，妹妹当了人家的小婆！……”
    豫西的同志说：“地主把我家剥削穷，全家十六口，饿死了十五口，只剩我一个，给地主家放羊，地主用石头打破我的头，我险些儿也叫他打死！……”
    徐治安同志说：“地主用酒把我爹灌醉，大卸了十八块，又强奸、霸占了我的母亲，姑母，姐姐，后来，又把我母亲逼死！……”
    诉苦的人，有的哭断气；有的哭得栽倒地上，昏过去；……听的人，不管干部，同学，事务人员，都哭得泪汪汪的。
    经过这样一诉，对地主的糊涂认识，都纠正了。有的甚至咬牙切齿地说：“这下我可明白了，地主不但该斗，应该杀光！”“都杀了！千刀万刮，也抵不住农民的命！”“我恨不得咬他几口！”“我回去，就是亲大爷，也要剥他几层皮！”领导上又诱导大家了解政策，不能肉体消灭地主阶级，大家也承认了，可是，从此以后眼睛都亮了，大家都说：“天下老鸦一般黑，地主就没有好的！”……
    三、不消灭蒋介石不回家
    大家诉了苦，追苦根追到地主身上；进一步又追到蒋介石身上，蒋介石是地主阶级的总根子，仇恨更深了。大家要向地主阶级要向蒋介石报仇！要彻底消灭地主阶级，和地主的老根子蒋介石，以求得解放自己，以至全中国和自己一样受压迫剥削的同胞，彻底翻身。
    于是，他们给校首长及大队首长的信中，一致表示着：“我们认识到阶级敌人是谁了，我们决心在党和毛主席的旗帜下，为革命奋斗到底！……在战斗中，要为党为人民，拿出牺牲自己的精神来！”
    怕死，想老婆，想家等思想，都云消雾散了，代替的只有一个同一的思想和意志：“不消灭蒋介石，誓不回家。”
    四、激愤的呼喊
    诉苦以后，不独眼睛明亮了，一种新的精神也焕发起来了，许多同志发出了激愤的呼喊：
    张保贵，过去对党有牢骚，不好好干工作，诉苦后，大哭着叫喊：“娘啊！你死的好苦啊！……如今，共产党就是我的亲娘啊！……我过去不好好工作，没好好为你报仇，真对不起你啊……！”
    路景文也放声大哭着说：“娘啊！（他娘被地主逼死）我过去不好好工作，不愿学习，人家都干活，我偏偏不干！……我对不住你啊！…”直哭的断了四次气。
    徐治安，回想起自己在前方，曾贪污公款八万元，栽倒在地，用拳头敲着自己的心窝，又用双手疯狂的抓着地，头到处乱碰着，从白天哭到半夜，连声叫着：“娘啊！我对不起你呵！党呵，对不住你啊！……”
