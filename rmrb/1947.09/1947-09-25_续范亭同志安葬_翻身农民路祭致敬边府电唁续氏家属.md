Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 22nd: The Jin Sui Border Region solemnly held Comrade Xu Fanting's funeral under strict security in a certain location in Lin County on the 18th of this month. The Director of the Jin Sui Border Region Administrative Office, representatives from all walks of life, representatives from various Lin County organizations, and liberated peasants from nearby villages all rushed to attend the funeral procession. Chairman Mao sent a telegram from northern Shaanxi expressing condolences and sending wreaths and elegiac couplets. The elegiac words were: "For national liberation, for the liberation of the class, the cause is about to be completed, why did you die, sir? With the breadth of mind of clouds and water, with the integrity of pine and cypress, such a model is suddenly lost, everyone is filled with grief!" Comrade Wu Yuzhang personally presided over the memorial ceremony. Along the route that the coffin passed through various villages, peasants offered roadside sacrifices one after another, set off firecrackers to pay their respects, and erected many plain-colored memorial arches inscribed with elegiac words such as: "Hardworking old folks are heartbroken," "The parent official of the poor," etc. Many liberated peasants competed to carry the coffin and canopies, and participated in the funeral with grief. After the masses arrived at the cemetery, the peasant ranks first offered sacrifices, and finally representatives of various organizations offered sacrifices. The coffin was then lowered into the tomb amidst solemn and mournful music.

[Our Newspaper] Yang and Rong, Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Border Region Government, sent a telegram of condolences to the family of Comrade Xu Fanting, stating: Director Xu joined the revolution early in his life and contributed to the country. After the September 18th Incident, he was even more indignant at the Kuomintang's betrayal of the country and harm to the people, and performed self-immolation in front of Sun Yat-sen's Mausoleum. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, he traveled through the enemy's rear battlefields, dedicated himself to the country, and gave his life for the people, causing the traitors and puppets to lose their courage. Now, as the nationwide counter-offensive is beginning and the bandit Chiang is about to die, your death is the greatest loss to the people of the entire country. The aspirations of Director Xu will be completed by the united efforts of the people of the entire country.

    续范亭同志安葬
    翻身农民路祭致敬边府电唁续氏家属
    【新华社晋绥二十二日电】晋绥边区本月十八日于临县某地禁严隆重举行续范亭同志葬礼，晋绥边区行署主任、各界代表，临县各机关代表及附近各村翻身农民均赶来参加送葬。毛主席由陕北来电致唁并送花圈挽联。挽词为：“为民族解放，为阶级翻身，事业垂成，公胡之死？有云水襟怀，有松柏气节，典型顿失，人尽含悲！”吴老玉章同志亲临主祭，灵柩经过沿途各村，农民纷纷路祭，放鞭炮致敬了并扎设许多素色牌坊，上书：“勤苦老百姓伤心”，“穷人的父母官”等挽词，许多翻身农民争抬棺材、帐幔，含悲参加葬仪。群众抵达墓园后，首由农民行列致祭，最后各机关代表致祭毕，灵柩遂在悲壮的哀乐中落墓。
    【本报讯】边区政府杨、戎正副主席电唁续范亭同志家属称：续主任早岁参加革命，功在国家。九一八后更因愤懑蒋党卖国害民，曾于中山陵前剖腹。抗战中辗转敌后战场，为国献身，为民舍命，使奸伪丧胆。现正值全国大反攻开始，蒋贼死亡在即，君尔逝世，实为全国人民之最大损失。续主任之遗志，全国人民当一致努力的于完成。
