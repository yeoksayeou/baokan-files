　　Calculate Deficiencies and Make Up Shortfalls, Save and Survive the Famine
  　Zhang Lianyun Makes a Plan to Promote the Whole Village
    [Our newspaper's dispatch from Jinan, Hebei, 13th] "Calculate deficiencies and make up shortfalls, produce and save" is Zhang Lianyun's famine survival policy. Zhang Lianyun is the chairman of the Farmers' Association of Qianbo in the Fifth District of Wuyi. The drought in the village is very serious, and the masses are preparing to face a famine year. Zhang Lianyun said to the other village cadres: "We must lead the masses to survive the famine. The cadres must first make a famine survival plan so everyone can see it." He first convened a family meeting and made a famine survival plan: This year he planted eleven mu of corn, estimating that it would yield at most three, four, or five jin. Two mu and four fen of millet, which would yield one or two hundred jin. Half a mu of sorghum, yielding fifteen jin, plus six fen of peanuts, eight fen of cotton, and one mu of radish and vegetables. All the crops collected would be equivalent to 114 jin of coarse grains, totaling 594 jin of grain. With six people in the family eating one jin of coarse grain per day, it wouldn’t even last until the lunar new year. At this point, Lianyun recalled the situation in the spring of 1932, when they hadn't eaten grain for more than ten days. He felt very uneasy. He calculated that from July 15th of this year to the end of April next year, the family would need at least 1975 jin of grain. After deducting the harvest, there would still be a deficit of 1381 jin until the next wheat season. Lianyun felt even more troubled. What should he do? As long as the deficit of 1381 jin of grain was solved, they could survive the famine. He finally came up with a plan: first, the whole family would continue to save. Each person would eat twelve liang a day, supplementing the insufficient amount with vegetables and tree leaves. He gritted his teeth and said, "If we tighten our belts, we can get through this. I'll start eating like this tomorrow." This way, they could save 570 jin of grain in ten months. During the New Year, they would give less gifts when visiting relatives and save another 20 jin. They would exchange cotton oil for hemp seeds, and he himself would quit smoking. When going to markets or shops, he wouldn't eat food from home, and counting one hundred days, he could save 75 jin. In total, eight items could save 785 jin. Lianyun felt somewhat relieved. After calculating the savings, there was still a shortage of 596 jin of grain. He said, "Let's work hard to produce. If production is good, we'll eat more. If production is bad, we'll tighten our belts again." His seventy-year-old father would spin thread. Besides cooking, weaving cloth, and doing odd jobs, his wife would weave two pockets a month, earning 100 jin of rice in ten months. The two children would cut grass and collect firewood. He himself would buy and sell pockets in the Bohai region, making one trip a month, carrying forty pockets each time. After deducting food and drink, earning 50 jin of rice per trip wouldn't be a problem. By the next wheat season, he could earn at least 500 jin. Lianyun calculated the income, expenses, savings, and production, and said, "Enough, enough! I'm not worried anymore. I'll definitely follow this plan and start implementing it tomorrow." He finally smiled and said to everyone he met, "My family won't starve to death!" He planned to use his own plan to promote the whole village, determined to ensure that everyone in the village could successfully survive the winter and spring famine.

　　算缺补缺节约渡荒
  　张连云订计划推动全村
    【本报冀南十三日电】“算缺补缺，生产节约”这是张连云的渡荒方针。张连云是武邑五区前泊的农会主任，该村旱灾很严重，群众都准备着过荒年，张连云对别的村干说：“咱得领导群众渡荒，当干部的先作渡荒计划，叫大家伙看看。”他首先召开了家庭会议，订出渡荒计划：他今年种了十一亩棒子，估计最多能收三四五斤，谷子二亩四分，能收一二○斤，半亩高粱，收十五斤，还有六分花生、八分棉花、一亩萝卜小菜，全部收来的约合杂粮一一四斤，总共能收粮食五九四斤，全家六口每人每天一斤粗粮，还吃不到阴历年。这时连云回想起卅二年春天，十几天没吃粮食的情境，心情很乱，他推算从今年七月十五到明年四月底，全家食用最少也得开支一九七五斤，除去收成，到明年麦季，还差一三八一斤。连云心里更着难了，怎么办呢？只要解决这一三八一斤粮食的亏空，就能渡过灾荒，他终于想出了办法：第一步、全家继续节约，每人一天按十二两吃，不够用菜和树叶去补充，他咬着牙说：“紧紧腰带，就能过得去，明天我就开始这么吃”，这样十个月能节省粮食五七○斤。过年时走亲戚弄干折礼，再节省二○斤。棉油用麻子换，自己坚决戒烟，赶集上店不吃饭。冬衣抽出四十斤，秋后自己跑买卖，不吃家里的饭，按一百天算，省七五斤。总计八项能节约七八五斤。连云心里有些轻松了，节约算帐后，还差五九六斤粮食，他说：“努力生产吧，生产的好了，多吃点，生产不好再紧腰。”七十岁的父亲就纺络线，老婆除做饭织布收拾零活以外，每月织两条口袋，十个月赚一○○斤米，二孩割草拾柴、自己再到渤海区贩买口袋，一月一趟，每趟担四十条，除吃喝外，赚五十斤米不成问题，到明年麦季，最少赚五○○斤。连云算了算收入、开支、节约、生产后说：“够了，够了，心里不捣蒜了，一定按照这计划作去，明天就执行。”他最后笑了，见人就说：“我家人这就饿不死啦！”他准备从他自己的计划推动全村，坚决要使全村人都能胜利的渡过冬春的灾荒。
