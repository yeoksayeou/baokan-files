Qingdao's harbor is dotted with American warships, the city is awash with the Stars and Stripes, and U.S. military checkpoints are everywhere. Qingdao has effectively become a colony of American imperialism, and our compatriots groan and moan under its oppression and plunder. Those well-fed American soldiers revel in the land of disaster they have created with their own hands. They exploit the poverty of our compatriots in the Jiang area to insult the personality of the Chinese people. They are happy to embrace a prostitute on the street for a low price, or ask a ragged beggar to stand for a photo, sending it back to the United States to promote their "prestige" in ruling China. Sometimes they even embrace so-called "jeep girls" and make a spectacle of themselves in the street. They possess all privileges, can watch plays without buying tickets, ride buses without paying, can use electric shocks privately when they are happy, enjoying the miserable cries of the Chinese people, can kick and punch Chinese compatriots, and use the Chinese people as bloody targets for bayonets or pistols, killing people without paying for their lives. Up to now, more than hundreds of our compatriots have been killed in Qingdao. Whenever Chinese compatriots are beaten and killed by U.S. soldiers, Jiang's officials either turn a deaf ear or come forward to defend the U.S. military. They usually try their best to ingratiate themselves, lest their American masters be unhappy. All the houses near the U.S. military camps are ordered to be demolished, and the Nanhai coast and the Qiao Zhan area, originally a good place for cooling off, are designated as a U.S. naval landing area and are forbidden to enter. The American merchants in Qingdao know better than the former Japanese merchants how to use the convenience of their rulers to engage in exploitation and extraction. American ships have become transportation tools for dumping American goods. The Kuomintang's Four Big Families' violent plundering of the people is a division of labor for the American aggressors. After they "took over" thousands of billions of yuan of factory materials from the Japanese invaders in Qingdao, which were plundered from the people's blood and sweat, they used the mountains of finished products and raw materials obtained without cost to compete with private industrial and commercial enterprises for profits. For example, the Jiang family's Zhongfang Company, which "took over" 350,000 spindles, monopolizes the cotton yarn market to attack the national industry, which has been devastated by American goods and is already on its last breath. Recently, the Qilu Enterprise Company, which was initiated by Zeng Yangfu, a member of the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang, consists of more than ten large factories "taken over" from the Japanese, such as the Qingdao Beer Company, the Taiyang Rubber Factory, the Dongya Flour Factory, and the Qingdao Nitric Acid Factory, with a total capital of hundreds of billions of yuan.

Under the economic plunder and oppression of Jiang and the U.S., about 300 private industrial enterprises have gone bankrupt or are on their last breath. The Huashang Match Factory, which used to have 20,000 workers, has almost completely shut down. The ice production of Qingdao Refrigeration Company was 70 tons per day last year, but this year it is 8 or 9 tons per day, only one-tenth or two-tenths of last year. In June alone, 38 dyeing and weaving factories declared bankruptcy. According to statistics at the end of last year, there were more than 8,700 private businesses in Qingdao, with a total capital of about 3.78 billion yuan. Even if the Jiang currency depreciates a hundred times compared with last year, it is not comparable to the Four Big Families' property in Qingdao. But after this year's intensified bankruptcy, most of them have half-closed their doors, and some have closed their doors and windows and become street vendors. In July alone, dozens of shops in the rubber, hardware, and general merchandise industries went bankrupt.

The population of Qingdao and its affiliated districts and villages is 700,000. According to the recent announcement by the Jiang-controlled Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, there are 100,000 unemployed workers. The pitiful unemployed people and their families huddle in small shacks, barely covered, filling their bellies with bran, vegetables, bark, and grass roots. More than 80% of the citizens' living standards have long fallen to the point of eating mixed grains. Therefore, although American goods are cheap, there are not many customers. Qingdao has lost its past beautiful scenery. The market is as desolate as a dilapidated temple. Social order has fallen into chaos and terror. It is pitch black at night, with sporadic gunfire, and pedestrians are reluctant to walk. Those active at night are the large number of pitiful prostitutes forced by life, the thieves who take risks, and the lawless American soldiers.

However, the Chinese people will never be willing to be slaves of a foreign country. The endless atrocities of the U.S. military have aroused widespread resistance among the compatriots in Qingdao, especially in the lower classes. The rickshaw pullers have united with their colleagues. When they encounter U.S. soldiers who refuse to pay for the ride and even commit violence, they will collectively surround and resist. U.S. soldiers who commit violence and beat people will encounter dense stones and fists from Chinese compatriots on the street. (Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 11th)

　　青岛殖民地相
    陈湘
    青岛港口星罗棋布地泊着美国军舰，市上飘扬着星条旗和密布着美军岗哨。青岛实际已成为美国帝国主义的殖民地，同胞们在其压迫掠夺下呼号呻吟。那些饱食终日的美军，在他们一手造成的灾难的土地上自得其乐。他们利用蒋区同胞的穷困来侮辱中国人民的人格，他们高兴用低廉的代价在街头搂抱着一个妓女，或者叫一个褛褴乞丐站着让他们拍照，寄回美国去宣扬他们统治中国的“威风”，有时更拥抱着所谓“吉普女郎”当街出丑。他们拥有一切特权，看戏可以不买票，坐车可以不给钱，高兴时可以私用电刑，听中国人民的惨号声作乐，可以拳打脚踢中国同胞，拿中国人民作为刺刀或手枪的血靶子，杀人不须偿命。到现在为止，我国同胞在青岛被杀害者在数百以上。每当中国同胞在遭受美军殴打杀害时，蒋家官员不是装聋作哑，便是出面为美军辩护。平时更刻意奉承，唯恐美国主人不欢，在美军军营附近的民房一律勒令拆除，原为纳凉胜地的南海沿及桥栈一带，则被划为美海军登陆处禁止入内。青岛的美商比过去的日本商人更懂得利用其统治者的便利，从事剥削榨取，美舰已成为美货倾销的运输工具。而四大家族对人民强暴的掠夺，是美国侵略者的分工，他们在青岛“接收”日寇掠自人民血汗的数千亿元工厂物资后，便利用无代价取得的堆积如山的制成品和原料，与民营工商业争利，例如“接收”纺锤三十五万锭的蒋家中纺公司，垄断棉纱市场，以打击遭受美货摧残业已奄奄一息的民族工业。最近以蒋党中执委ＣＣ曾养甫出面筹设的齐鲁企业公司，即以“接收”日产的青岛啤酒公司、太阳胶皮厂、东亚面粉厂、青岛硝酸厂等十余家大工厂组成，其资本额共达数百亿元。
    在蒋、美经济掠夺压迫下，三百家左右民营工业陷于破产或奄奄一息，过去拥有二万工人的华商火柴厂，几已全部停歇。青岛冷藏公司冰块，去年日产七十吨，今年日产八、九吨，仅及去年十分之一·二。在六月份一月内，染织厂即有卅八家宣告停业。据去年年底的统计，青市民营商号原有八千七百余家，资本总额约三十七亿八千万元。如以蒋币较去年贬值百倍计算，也抵不上四大家族在青市的财产；但经过今年加剧的破产，大多已半掩其门，好些已关上门窗变为摊贩。仅以七月份而论，就有橡皮、五金及百货业数十家商店倒闭。
    青市及其附属各区乡人口共七十万人，据蒋记市工会最近公布，失业工人就有十万，可怜的失业者，和他们的家属衣不蔽体的瑟缩在狭小的棚屋里，以糠菜及树皮草根充饥。百分之八十以上的市民生活水平早已降至改食杂粮，因此美货虽然价廉，但顾客已不多了。青岛已经失去过去明媚的风光。市面象破庙一样冷落。社会秩序陷入混乱与恐怖中，入夜一片漆黑，冷枪时起，行人裹足，夜间活动的是被生活所迫的大量可怜的妓女、挺而走险的行窃者，与无法无天的美军。
    但是中国人民决不甘心做亡国奴，美军层出不穷的暴行，在青岛同胞，特别在下层社会中已经激起广泛反抗，黄包车夫已经和同业们团结起来。遇到坐车不给钱还要行凶的美军便集体包围反抗，行凶打人的美军，会遇到街头中国同胞密集的石块与拳头。（新华社山东十一日电）
