　　Cui Village Gully Masses Raise Awareness
  　Jointly Struggle Against the "Sun Zhen Society"
    [Our Newspaper Tangyin News] After an intense movement against counter-settlement and "eating from the same pot" in five villages in Cui Village Gully, Tangyin West, the masses' awareness was raised, and a large-scale struggle against the landlord-feudal organization Sun Zhen Society was launched. The Sun Zhen Society is a mass organization of special agent landlords who ruled peasants in seven or eight counties around Tangyin. Its old nest is in Cui Village Gully. For more than ten years, the special agent landlords established armed teams, using it to suppress "bandits" and guard their homes, cruelly harming the peasant masses who suffered greatly. During the July Great Movement last year, the leadership thought that the masses' awareness was not enough at the time, so it was shelved. This year, after the Henan-North campaign, work in the village resumed, and after the masses regained their freedom, they thought of the crimes of the Sun Zhen Society, and said that this debt would be a problem sooner or later if it was not settled. The leadership recognized the mistake of waiting last year, and according to the masses' level of awareness, took the anti-counter-settlement a step further and launched the struggle against the Sun Zhen Society. Because the Sun Zhen Society had been using superstition to treat diseases for more than ten years, and most of the masses were also in the society, the struggle against the Sun Zhen Society was different from the struggle against landlords. The leadership affirmed the method of mobilizing the masses through confession and surrender, and pointed out the Sun Zhen Society's crimes of harming the people, killing people, arson, and murdering agricultural association members and plotting to kill village cadres last year. Let the peasants discuss in groups what the agricultural association did and what the Sun Zhen Society did, and called on the agricultural association members to confess themselves before talking about others. One by one, they confessed and complained, saying that they were "fooled by the landlords," and accused the crimes of the landlord spies Wang Xian, Wang Gedou (grandson of the traitor Wang Quanhuai), and others. Finally, they traced back to the big traitor and general regiment commander Wang Peicheng, and immediately twenty or thirty victims stood up to complain. Everyone gritted their teeth and said: This big bad guy ran away and can't breathe. The masses hated him so much that they hung up and beat his whole family, and his son revealed that his father was originally hidden in a cave behind his house and had not seen anyone for two months. After the masses brought him out, they twisted him to the meeting place, and everyone stretched their necks to look, clapping happily. The next day, a joint anti-Sun Zhen Society conference was held, and everyone complained to Wang Peicheng again. There were more than thirty cases of murder alone. Thirty or forty people surrounded the bad guy with knives, scissors, and sticks, asking him "Where did the person go?" Some wanted their children, some wanted their fathers. Ten traitorous bullies finally repaid their blood debts. The mountains of people crowded on both sides of the weir, clapping and cheering, and shouting, "The blood debts of the thirty-third year (famine year) can be settled today!" (Sou Peng)

　　崔村沟群众觉悟提高
  　联合大斗“孙真会”
    【本报汤阴讯】汤（阴）西崔村沟五村群众，进行了反倒算“一锅煮”的激烈运动后，提高了觉悟，掀起了反地主封建组织孙真会的大斗争。孙真会是汤阴周围七八个县特务地主统治农民的群众性的组织，老窝就在崔村沟。十余年来，特务地主成立会队武装，利用它剿“匪”看家，残害农民群众受尽灾难。去年七月大运动时，领导上以为当时群众觉悟不够，搁置未搞。今年豫北战役，该村工作恢复，群众重获翻身后，便想到孙真会的罪恶，都说这笔帐不算迟早是块病。领导上认识了去年等待的错误，根据群众的觉悟程度，把反倒算提高一步，展开了反孙真会斗争。由于孙真会十余年来的迷信医治，同时群众也多半在会，所以斗孙真会不同于斗争地主。领导上便肯定的以坦白自首的方式发动群众，提出孙真会危害人民杀人放火，及去年打死农会会员，谋杀村干部的滔天罪行，让农民分组讨论，看农会办了些啥事，孙真会办了些啥事，号召农会会员自己先坦白再说别人，于是一个个的又是坦白又是诉苦，都说是“上了地主的当”，控诉了地主特务王献、王圪斗（汉奸王全怀的孙子）等罪行。最后追到大汉奸总团师王佩成身上，立时二三十个苦主就站起来诉苦。个个咬牙切齿说：这个大坏蛋跑了出不透气。恨得群众把他全家吊起打，他儿子才说出他父亲原来是藏在他房后窑洞里，两个月了没见过人。群众把他弄出后，扭到会场，大家伸长脖子看，高兴的直鼓掌。第二天开联合反孙真会大会，大家就又对王佩成诉起苦来，光人命案子就三十多件，三四十个人拿着刀子剪子棍子齐围到坏蛋跟前，追问他“人哪里去了”？有的要孩子，有的要父亲，十个奸霸头子终于偿还了血债，两边堰上挤的人山人海，一齐鼓掌叫好，欢呼着“三十三年（灾荒年）的血债今天可清算了”！（叟蓬）
