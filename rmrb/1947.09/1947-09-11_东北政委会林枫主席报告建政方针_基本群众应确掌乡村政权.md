Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 9th. Chairman Lin Feng of the Northeast Administrative Committee delivered a summary report of over 8,000 characters on the construction of democratic power in the Northeast Liberated Areas at the first administrative conference of the Northeast on August 8th. The report is divided into four parts:

First, the general situation of democratic power in the Northeast Liberated Areas. It recounts how democratic power was gradually established and consolidated in the struggle to smash the remnants of the enemy and puppets, implement land reform, and persist in the patriotic self-defense war. During this period, a large number of liberated peasants were mobilized into the main force, and they supported the front lines on a large scale, mobilizing 594,000 civilian laborers, 43,000 stretchers, and 86,000 carts to bravely participate in the war. A vigorous land reform movement was carried out, enabling 6,290,000 landless or land-poor peasants in the Northeast Liberated Areas to receive 5,070,000 hectares (1 hectare equals 10 mu) of land. Financial and economic construction was carried out to ensure war supplies and mobilize the masses to produce, increasing the cultivated land area by one-tenth (excluding South Manchuria), reclaiming 800,000 hectares of wasteland, and restoring some industries, especially military industries related to the war and coal mines and electricity. A large number of secret service agencies were uncovered, and riots in many areas were suppressed. The bandits in the central areas have been basically eliminated. New democratic education was implemented, and more than 7,000 cadres were trained. Transportation and postal services also made great achievements, playing a significant role in serving the war and production.

Second, the nature of democratic power in the Northeast Liberated Areas. Like other liberated areas, its nature is a new democratic power led by the proletariat and united by all revolutionary classes against imperialism and feudalism; it is a democratic power against the United States and Chiang Kai-shek based on land reform. It includes all democratic strata, namely workers, peasants, the petty bourgeoisie, the national bourgeoisie, and enlightened gentry. Land reform is the foundation of democratic power. Peasants in the countryside are the main masses, and the countryside is our main area now. Therefore, the rural power should essentially be the power of the peasants. To firmly grasp the rural power in the hands of the basic masses is to complete the current task of democratic power construction. The Northeast Liberated Area still implements the "three-thirds system," but its content is somewhat different from that during the Anti-Japanese War. The minimum standard for participating in democratic power should be not opposing land reform, and the rural power should be based on activists in the land struggle. The staff of the democratic government should be representatives of the interests of the masses. A cleansing approach should be basically adopted towards the officials of the puppet Manchukuo regime. Lower-level personnel and technical personnel who have not committed evil deeds can be selected and used after strict examination, and their leadership and education should be strengthened. The establishment of democratic power in the Northeast should overcome the regular viewpoint of being divorced from the masses and the peaceful construction viewpoint of being divorced from the war. Organizational forms, work styles, and methods suitable for us should be established according to the war situation and the demands of the masses in the Northeast Liberated Area. In front of the people, it is necessary to distinguish the boundaries between the democratic government and the old regime. Democratic power should first mobilize the masses to have a foundation, have cadres, and expand the people's armed forces. Therefore, at the beginning, the Party, government, army, and people should work together, focusing on mobilizing the masses and doing a package of work. However, when the masses have been mobilized, the organization of power should be strengthened and its tasks should be increased. Communists working in the government should not engage in independence from the Party or underestimate the leadership of the Party, nor should they underestimate the work of power. It should be understood that the work of power is an important task of the Party and also the work of the masses. It is wrong to oppose the work of power and the work of the masses. Communists in power should examine themselves more from their own thinking and style, and should earnestly grasp policies and learn to work with non-Party members. The Party committee should ensure that the Party's leadership is realized through Party members. The laws of the democratic government are based on the opinions and needs of the majority of the masses, protecting the interests of all revolutionary classes and suppressing reactionary elements. The democratic government cannot handle affairs according to the old laws. Based on the opinions and needs of the majority of the masses and based on changes in the situation, the laws of the democratic power are changeable. Our laws come from the masses and go to the masses.

Third, the general task of democratic power in the Northeast Liberated Area at present is to: actively organize forces, consolidate and expand the Northeast Liberated Area, strive for the victory of the Northeast patriotic self-defense, and prepare to undertake the task of supporting the national self-defense war. Based on this general task, the specific tasks for the year are: (1) Supporting the war, which is the center of all tasks. First of all, the war viewpoint should be strengthened. It must be recognized that the traitorous head Chiang Kai-shek, with the help of American imperialism, will not easily give up the Northeast. The magnitude of this war and its long-term and arduous nature should be deeply estimated. Therefore, preparations should be made for larger-scale support for a long-term war. Ideologically, the viewpoint of war first must be established. The rear must ensure that good people, good horses, good guns, and good food are sent to the front line, and at the same time, the front line should save manpower and strictly prevent waste. Governments at all levels should: mobilize new soldiers to replenish the main force in a timely manner; mobilize financial and material resources to ensure supplies; properly resettle disabled personnel; earnestly implement preferential treatment for military martyrs' families; strengthen military supplies construction; and establish local armed forces. Governments at all levels should establish organizations to support the war, and organize a war support mobilization committee including the Party, government, army, and people, to cooperate with each battle, and timely achieve: sending up, transporting down, and resettling well. War support work should be combined with mass work and production education, so that the participating masses become working teams in the front and propaganda teams in the rear. Rear production should be planned in conjunction with war support, so that preparations are made well and arrangements are made well. At the same time, it is necessary to study and organize urban production to serve the war. (2) Land reform, which is the basic work running through all other tasks. After a year of land reform movement in the Northeast, the feudal rule has been basically destroyed in the rural areas of the central region, the advantage of the basic masses is being universally established, and the broad masses of peasants have grasped power and taken guns and seals. This situation has laid the foundation for all kinds of work. In the future, the land struggle must be deepened to thoroughly destroy the feudal forces, especially in the half-cooked areas and the vast newly recovered areas, boldly satisfying the demands of the masses. In the basic areas, land rights should be determined, land certificates should be issued, and land should be adjusted. (3) Financial and economic construction, with the ideological preparation for long-term support of the war, the production and construction policy should focus on agriculture, while developing industry and military industry, and restoring and developing industries needed for people's lives. In addition to supporting the front line, it should be ensured that the people have food to eat and clothes to wear, accumulate strength, expand production, and support a larger-scale long-term war. The production movement should be combined with land reform; experience has proven that the production movement is an important link in deepening and persisting in land reform. Agricultural production next year requires an increase in cultivated land and output by 10% to 15%. This year, the provinces have issued agricultural loans of 1.05 billion yuan (each yuan is equivalent to 10 yuan of Chiang's currency) and 45,000 tons of grain loans. They should be issued earlier next year, and they must be issued with emphasis and practically used in production. (4) Culture and education. At present, cadre education should still be the first priority, actively helping and promoting schools run by the people with government assistance, overcoming the old educational thinking of being divorced from the masses and actual production, and giving the nearly one million students in schools new democratic education. (5) Village administration construction. Village administration construction is the foundation of political power construction, and it is necessary to ensure that the basic masses firmly grasp village power. Village administration construction and village election movements cannot be carried out peacefully, but are fierce and complex struggles between democracy and anti-democracy. The village election movement must be carried out in areas where the advantage of the masses has been established, feudal forces have been basically destroyed, and the basic masses are in charge, that is, in "cooked" areas, to have practical significance, otherwise it will become formalism. In half-cooked areas, the peasant association should still be in power. The village election movement should become the central work for a certain period of time in the spring of next year, combined with "cooking half-cooked rice" and mobilizing production, mobilizing most of the Party, government, army, and people to carry out a large-scale and practical village election movement.

Fourth, leadership style and cadre issues. Strengthen the unification of policies and regulations, organizational structure, cadre appointment and removal, and finance and industry, and end the state of acting independently. Establish various work systems, democratic styles, and a working spirit of being serious, responsible, and down-to-earth in serving the people, conduct adjustment, review, and appraisal of cadres, and cultivate a large number of local cadres.

　　东北政委会林枫主席报告建政方针
  　基本群众应确掌乡村政权
    【新华社东北九日电】东北行政委员会林枫主席八月八日在东北第一次行政会议上，作了关于东北解放区民主政权建设长达八千余字的总结报告。该报告共分四部分：
    第一，东北解放区民主政权的概况。历述民主政权是在粉碎敌伪残余的斗争，实行土地改革与坚持爱国自卫战争中，逐渐建立与巩固起来的。在此期间，曾动员大批翻身农民涌入主力，大规模的支援了前线，动员五十九万四千民夫，四万三千付担架，八万六千辆大车奋勇参战。实行了轰轰烈烈的土地改革运动，使东北解放区六百二十九万无地或少地的农民，分得了五百零七万垧（每垧十亩）土地。进行了保证战争供给，发动群众生产的财政经济建设，增加耕地面积十分之一（南满除外），开荒八十万垧，恢复了一些工业，特别是与战争有关的军需工业及煤矿电气等。破获了大批特务机关，镇压了好多地区的暴动，中心地区的土匪已基本肃清。实行了新民主主义的教育，培养了七千多干部。交通邮电方面也很有成绩，对于战争与生产的服务，起了很大的作用。
    第二，东北解放区民主政权的性质。与其他解放区一样，其性质是无产阶级领导的反帝反封建的各革命阶级联合的新民主主义政权；是在土地改革的基础上，反美反蒋的民主政权。它包括各民主阶层，即工人、农民、小资产阶级、民族资产阶级及开明士绅。土地改革是民主政权的基础，乡村里农民是主要的群众，而乡村又是我们现在的主要地区，因此乡村政权实质上应是农民的政权，要把乡村政权切切实实的掌握在基本群众手里，就完成了民主政权建设的当前任务。东北解放区仍贯彻执行三三制政策，但其内容和抗日时期有某些不同，参加民主政权的最低标准，应是不反对土地改革，而乡村政权则应以土地斗争中的积极分子为骨干。民主政府的工作人员，应是群众利益的代表者，对于伪满官吏应基本采取清洗方针，对于未曾作恶的下层人员及技术人员，经过严格考察，可以选择使用，并应加强对于他们的领导和教育。东北民主政权的建立，应该克服脱离群众的正规观点及脱离战争的和平建设观点。应该根据东北解放区战争的形势及群众的要求来建立适合我们的组织形式、工作方式与方法。在人民面前，必须与旧政权分清界限。民主政权应首先发动群众才有基础，才有干部，才能扩大人民武装；因此在开始时，党政军民一齐动手，以发动群众为主，一揽子工作。但当群众已发动起来，应加强政权组织与加重其任务。共产党员在政府里工作，不能对党闹独立性及轻视党的领导，也不应轻视政权工作，须知政权工作是党的重要工作，也是群众工作；把政权工作与群众工作对立起来是不对的。政权中的共产党员，多从自己思想上作风上检讨，要切实做到掌握政策，学会与非党人士共同工作，党委则要做到经过党员实现党的领导。民主政府的法律是根据大多数群众的意见与需要而产生的，是保护各革命阶级的利益与镇压反动分子的。民主政府不能根据旧法律办事；根据多数群众意见与需要，根据情况的变化，民主政权的法律是可改变的，我们的法律是从群众中来、到群众中去的。
    第三，东北解放区民主政权当前的总任务是：积极组织力量，巩固和扩大东北解放区，争取东北爱国自卫的胜利，并准备担负支援全国自卫战争的任务。根据这个总任务，一年内的具体任务为：（一）支援战争，这是一切任务的中心。首先应加强战争观点，必须认识卖国头子蒋介石在美帝国主义帮助下，是不会轻易放弃东北的。应该深刻估计此次战争规模之大及其长期性与艰苦性，因此要准备更大规模的支援长期战争。在思想上要建立战争第一的观点，后方一定做到好人、好马、好枪、好粮都送上前线，同时前方也应节省民力、严防浪费。各级政府应做到：动员新兵及时补充主力；动员财力物力保证供给；妥善安置残废人员；切实实行优待军烈属；加强军需建设；建立地方武装。各级政府应建立支援战争的组织，并组织一包括党政军民的支战动员委员会，配合每个战役，及时做到：送上去，运下来，安置好。战勤工作应和群众工作及生产教育相结合，使参战群众成为前方工作队与后方宣传队。后方生产应有计划的结合战勤，做到准备好、安排好；同时要研究组织城市生产为战争服务。（二）土地改革，这是贯串其他各项任务的基础工作。东北经过一年的土地改革运动，在中心地区农村中基本上摧毁了封建统治，基本群众的优势正在普遍树立，广大农民掌握了权，拿了枪把子、印把子，这个形势推动了各种工作都有了基础，今后必须深入土地斗争，彻底摧毁封建势力，特别在夹生地区及广大新收复区内大胆放手满足群众要求，在基本地区应确定地权，发给地牌，调整土地。（三）财经建设，要有长期支援战争的思想准备，生产建设的方针以农业为主，同时发展工业及军需工业，并恢复与发展人民生活所需的工业。除了支援前线外，应保证人民有饭吃，有衣穿，积蓄力量，扩大生产，支援更大规模的长期战争。生产运动要与土地改革相结合；经验证明，生产运动是深入与坚持土地改革的重要一环。农业生产明年要求增加耕地和产量百分之十至十五。今年各省发放农贷十亿五千万元（每元合蒋币十元）、贷粮四万五千吨，明年应提早发，必须有重点的发放，并切实用在生产上。（四）文化教育。目前干部教育仍应占第一位，积极帮助与提倡民办公助的学校，克服脱离群众与实际生产的旧教育思想，给予正在学校的近百万学生以新民主主义的教育。（五）村政建设。村政建设是政权建设的基础，一定要使基本群众切实掌握村政权。村政建设与村选运动是不能和平进行的，而是激烈的复杂的民主与反民主的斗争。村选运动必需在群众优势已经树立、封建势力基本摧毁，基本群众当家了，即在“煮熟”的地区进行，才有实际意义，否则会成为形式主义。夹生地区仍应是农会当权。村选运动要成为明年春季一定时期的中心工作，与“煮夹生饭”及发动生产相结合，动员党政军民大部力量，展开大规模的切切实实村选运动。
    第四，领导作风与干部问题。加强政策法令、机构编制、干部任免及财政工业等的统一，结束各自为政的状态。建立各种工作制度、民主作风及认真负责踏踏实实为老百姓办事的工作精神，进行调整考查、鉴定干部，大量培养土生土长的干部。
