    Launch a Deep Propaganda Counter-Offensive in Chiang-Controlled Areas
    Xiangling Launches Political Offensive
    Our Military and Political Offensive in Northern Henan Will Also Be Launched Vigorously
    [This newspaper, Taiyue, 21st dispatch] "Bring the news of the great counter-offensive victory to the people in the Chiang-occupied areas!" Xiangling took the lead in launching a political offensive. From the 13th, propaganda teams went deep into the Chiang-occupied areas of Zhangli, Jiazhuang, and Xiaxiliang to carry out propaganda activities. Braving the threat of enemy artillery and machine guns from the northern strongholds, they went deep into villages such as Xiaxiliang to spread propaganda, using clapper talks, shadow plays, and drum storytelling to attract the entire village. Everyone listened with smiles on their faces. They said, "Now those village bandits are going to collapse!" "Now the local bullies will have their world turned upside down! Now everything will be clear! Good times are coming soon!" At this time, enemy shells hit the edge of Xiliang Village, and the propaganda team withdrew. The people kept sending them off, urging them: "Be sure to come back tomorrow!"
    [This newspaper, Taihang, 19th dispatch] Our army has begun a nationwide counter-offensive, and the Chiang bandits in northern Henan are extremely panicked and uneasy. The Political Department of the 4th Military Sub-district of Taihang Northern Henan issued instructions to all subordinate troops and county headquarters on September 1st, demanding that they quickly launch a vigorous political offensive. It first stated: As our army moves south in large numbers, we must use facts to vigorously publicize the victorious situation after our great counter-offensive. For example, the boatmen who helped the troops cross the river and return from Wen County and Meng County publicized the victorious situation of our army's successive battles after crossing the river, and the masses' enthusiasm for victory immediately rose. The instructions continued: Before their demise, the Chiang bandits will inevitably struggle desperately. Our local corps should continue to launch offensives against the enemy, suppress local bullies and despots, and actively support the masses in carrying out land reform until the Chiang bandits are finally eliminated. Specific methods: Hold small-scale mass symposiums, combine with land reform, celebrate the victory of our army's great counter-offensive, and post propaganda materials and good news. At the same time, send small units to engage the enemy in shouting campaigns, explain the current situation and our propositions and prisoner policies, and call on Chiang bandit soldiers to turn their guns around, stand with the People's Liberation Army, and overthrow the traitor Chiang Kai-shek as soon as possible.

    深入蒋区宣传大反攻
    襄陵展开政治攻势
    豫北我军政攻亦将猛烈开展
    【本报太岳二十一日电】“把大反攻的胜利消息，带给蒋占区的老百姓!”襄陵首先展开政治攻势，于十三日起对敌宣传工作队深入蒋占区张礼、贾庄、下西梁一带进行宣传活动。冒北面据点敌人大炮机枪威胁，深入到下西梁等村宣传，用快板、洋片、鼓书引来了全村老百姓，大家听得眉开眼笑。他们说：“这一下可该编村贼娃子垮了！”“这一下土顽可叫咱黑了天，这可黑白分明了！快了，好青天来了！”这时敌人的炮弹打到了西梁村边上，宣传工作队才撤离。老百姓一直送出来，叮嘱道：“明天可还要来啊！”
    【本报太行十九日电】我军开始全国性反攻，豫北蒋匪异常恐慌不安。太行豫北四军分区政治部，特于九月一日，向所属各部队及各县指挥部指示，迅速开展猛烈的政治攻势。首称：由于我大军南下，必须用事实来大力宣传我大反攻后的胜利形势。如自温县、孟县等地帮助部队过河返回之水手，宣传我军渡河后连打胜仗情形，群众胜利情绪立即高涨。指示继称：蒋匪死前，势必拚死挣扎。我各地兵团，应继续对敌展开攻势，镇压土顽奸霸，积极支援群众进行土地改革，直到最后消灭蒋匪。具体作法：普遍召开小型群众座谈会，结合土地改革，庆祝我军大反攻胜利，张贴宣传品与捷报。同时派遣小部队接敌喊话，讲解目前形势及我们的主张与俘虏政策，号召蒋匪士兵掉转枪口，和人民解放军站在一起，早日打倒卖国贼蒋介石。
