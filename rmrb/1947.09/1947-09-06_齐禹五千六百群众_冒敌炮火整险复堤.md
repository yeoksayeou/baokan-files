[This dispatch from our newspaper's Ji-Lu-Yu office on the 3rd] During the high flood season, in our Qi-Yu repair section, the leadership led the masses in repairing dangerous embankments under the attacks of Chiang Kai-shek's troops and planes. Since the embankment repair this spring, the enemy has frequently dispatched troops to harass us, causing great difficulties to our embankment repair project. Now, in this time of great flooding and rapidly rising water levels, the masses have once again risen up to repair the embankments and deal with dangerous areas in order to raise the inner embankment and consolidate the dangerous works. On the 4th and 5th of last month, the entire county successively gathered 5,600 people to work. First, they built a soil wall on the river side of the inner embankment as a bunker, and then universally backfilled and built earth entrenchments. At the dangerous point of Daqiao Village in the Second District, the rising water seeped through the stone revetment and overflowed outwards. The engineering team immediately led the masses to transport wooden stakes and straw materials to the second dam on the back of the river during the day, and then rushed to repair it at night. During the rush repair, many model deeds and model figures emerged, such as the 66-year-old technician Li Sisheng and squad leader Jiao Zuohai of the engineering team, who both bravely took the lead. On August 1st, the stone dam at Daqiao Village was once in critical condition. That morning, the engineering team went up to rush repairs, but as soon as they started to drive in the piles, the Chiang Kai-shek troops on the opposite bank opened fire. The entire team hid behind the dam in the water, but after a burst of gunfire, comrades Li and Jiao immediately called on everyone to get up and rush to repair the dam. Later, they had no choice but to switch to night repairs, repairing for four consecutive nights, and finally saved this dangerous project, avoiding disaster.

　　齐禹五千六百群众
  　冒敌炮火整险复堤
    【本报冀鲁豫三日电】大汛时期我齐禹修防段，领导群众在蒋军蒋机袭击下，整险复堤。今春复堤以来，敌人经常出发扰乱，使我复堤工程遭受极大困难，现大泛时期，水位暴涨，为加高内堤，巩固险工，群众又奋起复堤、整险；上月四、五两日，全县先后集合五千六百人到工，先在内堤靠河一边修一道土墙作为掩体，然后普遍复土修筑土堑子。二区大谯庄险工处，水涨透过石护堰，向外漫溢，工程队即带领群众在白天将木桩、秸料运到背河的二道坝上，待夜晚抢修。抢修中出现了许多模范事迹和模范人物，如工程队六十六岁的技师李泗生和班长焦作海，均勇敢带头。八月一日大谯庄石坝曾一度危急，当天上午工程队上去抢修，但刚动手下桩，对岸蒋军打起枪来，于是全队便藏在堰后水里，但一阵枪打过之后，李、焦两同志就马上号召大家起来抢险，后来不得已改在晚上抢修，一连抢修四夜，终将此险工救住，免于灾患。
