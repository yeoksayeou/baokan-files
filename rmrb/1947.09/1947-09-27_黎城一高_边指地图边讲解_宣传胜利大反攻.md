    Licheng No. 1 High School
    Explaining the Victorious Counter-Offensive While Pointing at the Map
    [This newspaper's Licheng report] The great victory of the counter-offensive spread to Taihang and also to No. 1 High School. Teachers, forgetting to eat lunch, immediately drew a map of the county towns captured by our army on a blackboard on the street, and then gave a geography lesson to the students at the school. Cook Zhang Rui San asked clerk Wang Jianzhang for a victory map and posted it in the kitchen. The eighth and ninth grade students discussed late into the night how to publicize the victory to the villagers, and decided that explaining with maps would be easy to understand. They used large hemp paper to draw eleven large counter-offensive maps. Three teams (twenty-six people) publicized it at the market on the 18th. In front of the county government, the audience was crowded. A comrade in military uniform said, "Explaining with maps is easier to understand than reading the newspaper!" An old man selling pears stopped us and wanted to hear the news. He put down his burden and asked in detail while holding the map, "Is that the Yellow River, the Yangtze River? Is that Nanjing, Hankou?" Walking to the door of the County Cooperative, a cloth seller stopped us and asked, "How far is it from Hankou?" Several farmers who were going to the market asked in detail, "Where do we cross the Yellow River? Where are we fighting?" They especially wanted to ask, "Where are the militia who participated in the war? How far are they from our home?" When we explained that Liu Deng and Chen Xie's armies had captured 34 cities in a row, and were only 150 miles away from Nanjing, where they were already in a panic and under martial law, an old man happily said, "Good news! Good news! This victory is not simple, soon we will be attacking Chiang Kai-shek's lair!" Another woman waved her hand and called to her companion, "Come quickly, listen to the news, it's really good!" There were many people at the pig butcher shop. When the news was announced, they all ignored the pig butchering and turned their heads to listen to the news. The butcher quickly put down his knife and squeezed into the crowd. After listening clearly, he said, "Chiang Kai-shek is like this pig, he's about to be knifed!" An old man followed us from the market all the way to the county government gate and said, "I haven't heard it clearly yet, I'll listen again and then go back to publicize it!"

    边指地图边讲解
    宣传胜利大反攻
    【本报黎城讯】反攻大捷，传到了太行，也传到了一高校，教员顾不上吃午饭，把我军攻克县城地图立刻画到大街黑板上，又在学校给学生当地理课来讲。伙夫张瑞三找事务员王建章给了一幅胜利地图贴在厨房，八九班同学们星夜商议怎样把胜利宣传给老乡，决定讲解地图容易懂，大家用大麻纸画了十一幅大举反攻图。三个小队（二十六人）十八日到集上宣传了，县府门前，听众拥挤成一团，一个穿军衣同志说：“用地图讲比念报好懂！”卖梨老汉拦住要听听消息，放下担子，把住地图详细问着：“那是黄河，长江？那是南京，汉口？”走到县联社门口，一个卖布的拦住问：“离汉口到底还有多远？”几个赶集的农民，详细问询着：“咱从那里过黄河？咱打倒那一带啦？”特别要问问“参战民兵，现在在那一带？离咱家多远？”我们讲到刘邓陈谢两路大军连克三十四城，距南京仅仅一百五十华里，那里已经手忙脚乱戒严时，一个老乡高兴的说：“好消息呀！好消息呀！这胜利真不简单，快打到蒋介石老窝啦！”另一个妇女摇摇手叫她的同伴说：“快快来，听听消息，真好！”杀猪铺那里人很多，讲开消息时都不顾瞧杀猪了，扭头都来听消息，杀猪的赶紧放下屠刀，挤到人丛中，听清后说：“蒋介石也象这个猪一样，快吃刀啦！”一个老汉从集上一直跟到县府门前说：“我还没听清楚，再听听回去好好宣传！”（志这）
