The Great Production Movement in Taihang area this year has raised new issues and provided new experiences in terms of guiding ideology and leadership methods. Firstly, in terms of ideological mobilization of the masses, after half a year of exploration, it has been clearly recognized that inspiring and grasping the positive thinking of poor and hired peasants, and mobilizing them as the backbone to take action first, is a very good leadership method to break through the ideological obstacles of the masses and carry out the movement. At the beginning of the movement, the leadership proposed to carry out the production movement on the basis of the land reform movement, and to organize the enthusiasm of the land reform movement into the production movement. After the peasants were emancipated, they regained the land that they had hoped for but could not obtain for thousands of years, and they demanded to "actively produce and get rich" on their own land with the attitude of masters. This is the basic demand of the masses, especially the poor and hired activists who first became aware and played a leading role in the land reform movement. The "stingy household" mentality of fearing struggle and fearing communism and not daring to actively develop, is only a partial middle peasant class, and a small number of masses who have not been fully mobilized under the influence of the middle and rich peasants. As long as the poor and hired are mobilized to take the lead and take action first, the middle peasants will quickly abandon their wait-and-see attitude and join the movement, and ideological concerns will be relatively easy to resolve. Under the guidance of this new viewpoint, various places have adopted different approaches: One, Gaoyi, Xingtai and other places, organized the emancipated peasants to recall their history, "praising the merits of labor and complaining about the suffering of labor," so that the masses recognized the glory of labor and the creation of the world by labor, as well as their past suffering, and clarified the two kinds of worlds, "In the past, the movement was for others (landlords), and in the future, labor will be for ourselves." They also naturally realized that "emancipation depends on struggle, and getting rich depends on labor," and the production movement was quickly launched. Shahe, Changzhi and other places started from drawing a clear line between classes, and further enlightened the peasants' class consciousness, and brought the middle peasants into their own camp. The leadership, combined with the peasants' ideological consciousness, compensated the wrongly criticized middle peasants, further investigated feudalism, and closely linked the relationship between middle and poor peasants through labor, eliminating the middle peasants' concerns. Similarly, on the basis of the broad masses of peasants' labor consciousness and future consciousness, village cadres and the masses exposed some of their own or others' previous ideological concerns as unfounded, criticized negative attitudes, and the masses automatically persuaded the lazy people and vagrants, creating a mass movement of mutual encouragement to move forward together on the road to prosperity. And the high development of the masses' positive thinking and actions also inspired the cadres, filled them with confidence in leading production, and quickly set off a conscious production movement. Wuxiang and other places started from "comparing merits and selecting models." Licheng and Lucheng raised the question of "What to do after emancipation?" thereby enlightening the masses' production consciousness. Although there are differences in methods in various places, their common characteristics are: (1) To promote the positive thinking of the masses, enlighten their positive side, concentrate on the essential demands of the basic masses after land reform, especially to affirm and promote the thinking of the poor and hired peasants who are more conscious and demanding active development, as the guiding ideology for the broad masses of peasants to enter the second revolution. (2) To link the resolution of ideological problems with practical actions, to overcome the concerns of some middle peasants with practical actions, especially to take the poor and hired as the backbone to lead the masses to take action first, which plays a decisive role in removing ideological concerns. (3) To closely combine the enlightenment of the peasants' class labor consciousness with the investigation and squeezing of feudalism, to further improve the peasants' class consciousness, and to make the production movement a conscious and voluntary class action of the masses.

Secondly, the development and sustained adherence of the Great Production Movement must have leading backbones who serve as the mainstay of the movement. We must pay close attention to how to transform the leading backbones, activists, heroes and models in the land reform movement into leading backbones, activists, heroes and models in the production movement. This is because they have a higher class consciousness, and diligent production and bold development of labor consciousness are also a manifestation of class consciousness. Since they have overthrown the feudal class as masters of the land, they will actively work, build their homes and careers, and lead the class masses to develop together as masters of the land. With this view clarified, they will consciously transform the leadership organizations in various production links in the movement, cleanse class alien elements from them, and absorb a large number of mass leaders, heroes and models in the emancipation to serve as leading backbones of various production organizations, and help them clarify the direction and path of developing production, and solve the specific difficulties in their development, so that the top-down support and decision-making are combined with the bottom-up bold creation. Wherever attention has been paid in the movement to taking the conscious emancipated peasants as the leading backbone, uniting all the peasants, and further harmonizing the relationship between cadres and the masses, the development of the production movement will be full of vigorous vitality and a tenacious fighting spirit to overcome difficulties.

Carrying out the merit-making movement in the Great Production Movement is also a new leadership method widely adopted in various places. This movement itself is a concrete manifestation of promoting the positive side and encouraging the production enthusiasm of the working people. Historically, the creative talents and labor achievements of the broad masses of peasants have always been buried by feudal society. Since the Anti-Japanese War, although we have also implemented incentive policies in production, they have not been frequent enough. After half a year of exploration and creation in the merit-making movement in the Great Production Movement, we have clarified and mastered this new leadership weapon. The universal development of the peasants' production enthusiasm after emancipation is the social basis for carrying out the merit-making movement. The heroes and models who emerged in the Great Production Movement immediately became the banner for the broad masses to strive forward, and highly promoted the new heroism of the working people. "Labor is glorious" has truly become a universal mass thought, and merit-making itself has also become the guiding force for various production policies. Textile merit-making has promoted the rapid development of the hundred-textile movement, and mutual aid merit-making has promoted the widespread implementation of "organizing". But there is a basic experience here, that is, in the leadership ideology, it is necessary to clearly identify the question of "who makes merit and for whom to commend". In today's era after the great emancipation of the working people, we must encourage the working people to actively make merit on the production front, and we must sing praises for the working people. And for the exploiting class hated by the people, even if they are forced to participate in labor after liquidation, and even show "positive" performance, we can only express our hope for them, but we must never praise them like we do for the workers. In some areas, in the Great Production Movement, they abstractly understood the call of "everyone can make merit," and they generally carried out merit-making and model-making without asking about the object and its motives. As a result, the liquidated landlords were also "selected" as heroes, or they publicized and praised how actively the objects of struggle were producing and how exemplary they were, and used this to stimulate the peasants to "open up their minds" and learn from them. As a result, it "reduced the prestige of the peasants and increased the spirit of the landlords," which is not right.

　　生产运动中的贫雇骨干问题
    武光汤　林朋
    本年太行各地的大生产运动，在指导思想上与领导方法上，提出了新的问题与提供了新的经验。首先在群众的思想发动上，经过半年来的摸索，已明确的认识到，启发与掌握贫雇农的积极思想，发动以贫雇农为骨干，首先行动起来，是打破群众思想障碍开展运动很好的领导方法。运动刚开始，领导上即提出在翻身运动的基础上开展生产运动，要把翻身运动的热气，组织到生产运动中来。农民在翻身之后，收回了自己几千年所希望而不能得到的土地，要求在自己的土地上以主人翁的姿态，“积极生产，发家致富”。这是群众的基本要求，特别是在翻身运动中首先觉悟起带头作用的贫、雇积极层，要求更为迫切；怕斗争，怕共产不敢积极发展的“圪＠户”思想，仅是部分中农阶层，及在中富农影响下的少数未充分发动的群众，只要发动贫、雇带头首先行动起来，中农即很快放弃了自己的观望而跟着卷入了运动，思想顾虑就比较容易的解决了。在这一新的观点的指导下，各地采取了不同的入手办法：一专高邑、邢台等地，是组织翻身农民从历史上回忆，“夸劳动功，诉劳动苦”，使群众认识劳动光荣与劳动创造世界，以及自己过去的痛苦，明确了两种世道，“过去运动为人家（地主），今后劳动为自己。”也就很自然的认识了“翻身靠斗争，发家靠劳动”，生产运动便很快开展起来。沙河长治等地，是从划清阶级界线，进一步启发农民的阶级自觉，把中农划到自己阵容中来。领导上结合农民的思想自觉，补偿错动了的中农，进一步追查封建，从劳动上密切中、贫农的关系，消除了中农的疑虑。同样也在广大农民劳动自觉和前途自觉的基础上，村干与群众都揭露了自己或别人以往之某些思想顾虑没有根据，批判了消极态度，群众自动的对懒汉、游民进行了规劝，造成群众性的互相鼓励，在发家道路上共同前进。而群众的积极思想与行动的高度发扬，同样也振奋了干部，充满了领导生产信心，迅速掀起了自觉的生产运动。武乡等地是从“比功劳，选模范”开始。黎城、潞城则是提出“翻身以后干什么？”从而启发群众的生产自觉。各地方法上虽有差异，但其共同特点是：（一）发扬群众积极思想，启发其积极面，集中土改后基本群众的本质要求，特别是把觉悟较高要求积极发展的贫雇农思想，肯定起来，加以发扬，作为广大农民进入第二革命的指导思想。（二）、解决思想与实际行动联系起来，以实际行动克服某些中农的顾虑，特别是以贫、雇为骨干带领群众首先行动，对解除思想顾虑起决定作用。（三）、启发农民的阶级劳动自觉与查挤封建运动密切结合起来，更加进一步提高农民的阶级觉悟，使生产运动成为群众自觉自愿的阶级行动。
    其次是大生产运动的开展与饱满的坚持下去，一定要有充任运动中坚的领导骨干。须十分注意如何把翻身运动的领导骨干，积极分子，英雄模范，变为生产运动中的领导骨干，积极分子与英雄模范。这是因为他们是有较高的阶级觉悟，而勤恳生产，大胆发展的劳动自觉也就是阶级自觉的一种表现，他们既然曾以土地的主人姿态，打翻了封建阶级，就会以土地的主人姿态积极劳动，兴家立业，带领阶级群众，共同发展。明确了这一观点，便会有意识的从运动中放手改造各种生产环节上的领导机构，从中清洗阶级异己分子，大量吸收翻身中的群众领袖，英雄模范充任各个生产组织的领导骨干，并帮助其明确发展生产的方向道路，解决其发展中的具体困难，使自上而下的撑腰作主与自下而上的大胆创造相结合。凡是在运动中注意了以觉悟的翻身农民为领导骨干，团结全体农民，进一步谐调干群关系的地区，便会使生产运动的发展，充满了饱满的朝气，与顽强的克服困难的斗志。
    在大生产运动中开展立功运动，也是各地普遍采用的新的领导方法。这个运动本身，是发扬积极面，鼓舞劳动人民生产热情的具体表现形式。在历史上，广大农民的创造才能与劳动功绩是一向被封建社会所埋没。抗战以来，我们在生产上虽然也曾实行了奖励政策，但也不够经常。经过半年来在大生产中开展立功运动的摸索创造，才使我们明确了和掌握了这一新的领导武器。翻身后农民生产积极性的普遍发扬，是开展立功运动的社会基础。大生产中涌现出的功臣模范，便立即成为广大群众努力前进的旗帜，高度发扬劳动人民的新英雄主义。“劳动光荣”，真正变成为普遍的群众思想，立功本身也成为各种生产政策的指导力量，纺织立功，推动了百纺运动的迅速开展，互助立功，便促成“组织起来”的广泛推行。但这里有一个基本经验，便是在领导思想上要切实辨清“谁来立功，为谁表功”的问题。在劳动人民大翻身以后的今天，就要鼓励劳动人民在生产战线上积极立功，我们要为劳动人民而歌功颂德。而为人民所痛恨的剥削阶级，即使在清算以后被迫参加劳动，甚至也表现了“积极”，我们只可表示这是对于他们的希望，但绝不能象对劳动者一样给以歌颂。有的地区在大生产中，抽象的了解“人人能立功”的号召，便不问对象与其动机，而只是一般化的进行立功表模，结果把清算了的地主也“选”上了英雄，或是宣传表扬被斗对象如何生产积极、如何模范，并用以刺激农民“打通思想”，向人家学习，结果是“减了农民的威风，长了地主的锐气”，这是不应该的。
