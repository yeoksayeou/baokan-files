　　The Military and Civilians of Southern Hebei, Shandong and Henan Along the Yellow River
　　Coordinate with the Overall Counter-Offensive, Attacking Chiang Kai-shek Bandits Everywhere
　　[Reported by our newspaper from Southern Hebei, Shandong and Henan on the 15th] The seven million soldiers and civilians south of the Yellow River in Hebei, Shandong and Henan are adhering to guerrilla positions, welcoming the nationwide counter-offensive. Since the Liu-Deng army crossed the Longhai Railway and advanced into the Chiang-controlled areas, liberating vast areas of the Central Plains, the area south of the Yellow River has been temporarily occupied by the Chiang army. However, due to the Chiang army's insufficient and dispersed forces, and the necessity of assigning a portion to guard its old nests, vast areas are extremely empty, occupied only by local reactionary landlords and puppet troops. Although the Chiang bandits use the New Fifth Army and other units, traveling back and forth along the Yunju and Juhe highways from north to south and south to north, it is difficult to remedy their insufficient forces. When the enemy's main force comes to "patrol," we disperse. Local armed forces (including militia, armed work teams, and field protection teams) adopt key blocking tactics on one hand, and organize and lead the masses to evade on the other. At the end of July, when the main forces of the Chiang army, the 73rd Army and the 12th Army, advanced to Dongping, a part of our militia deployed a 50-li-long defense line along the Daqing River bank, from Beida Bridge to Nanchengzi, to block the enemy from crossing the river. After a day and a night, four enemy planes shuttled back and forth, concentrating artillery fire to attack the ferry, but we resolutely resisted and safely transferred after killing more than ten enemies. Another part of the militia field protection team cooperated with command departments at all levels to lead the masses in guerrilla warfare. For example, in villages such as Cangqiu, all five or six hundred villagers safely transferred to the central area under the leadership of the command department. After the enemy's main force left, we concentrated superior forces to strike local reactionaries and puppet troops, and seized the opportunity to carry out land reform. On August 25, after the main force of the Chiang army in Juancheng went south, we concentrated our forces to besiege the enemy's strongholds. The Chiang puppet seventh district headquarters and three puppet township offices and landlord militias, totaling about 250 people, were surrounded and attacked by us, and the enemy scattered and fled. We killed or captured more than 50 of them and seized a portion of war booty. On the 27th, Dong Ziqin's unit, the puppet township chief of Linze, with more than 50 men, went to Caozhuang to loot grain. Our county brigade set up an ambush and wiped them all out. In areas occupied by local reactionaries and puppet troops where the Chiang army's main force has not arrived, the enemy is even more panicked and dare not easily go out to loot grain and harass the people. Therefore, in the vast guerrilla areas, we seize the opportunity to vigorously carry out land reform. One-third of the administrative villages in the fifth district of Juancheng have initially completed land reform, clearing out hidden wealth and unearthing more than 17,000 jin of grain. In areas bordering the enemy's main force, or areas where the enemy's main force frequently "patrols," or areas where local reactionaries are more active, we concentrate local armed forces to provide cover for land reform. Kaocheng organized all armed forces into dozens of guerrilla groups, striking small groups of enemies on one hand and helping the masses to divide land and grain on the other. Dongping County established a joint defense command to unifiedly lead armed work teams, field protection teams, and militia to mobilely strike the enemy and provide cover for land reform. Due to the forceful adherence to guerrilla positions, the morale of the masses is very high. From August 5 to 18, when the Chiang Fifth Army and Wu Huawen's traitorous troops occupied Kunshan, the local democratic government led the militia to adhere to their positions, never retreating a single step. They dispersed during the day and concentrated at night. When the enemy "sweeps," they set up small sheds in the sorghum fields as temporary command posts. Every night, they go into the villages to tell the masses that we have not left, and we will share life and death with the masses. They also warn bad landlords not to hide or destroy grain. Knowing that we have not left, the masses are all elated, delivering food and melons every night, and the people's hearts are very stable.

　　冀鲁豫黄河南军民
  　配合全面反攻到处打击蒋匪
    【本报冀鲁豫十五日电】冀鲁豫黄河以南七百万军民，坚持游击阵地，迎接全国大反攻。自刘邓大军跨过陇海，挺进蒋管区，解放中原广大地区后，黄河以南暂时为蒋军侵占，但由于蒋军兵力不足、分散，又不能不抽调一部守卫其老窠，致广大地带，十分空虚，仅为土顽杂伪占领。蒋匪虽以新五军等由北到南、由南到北，沿郓钜、钜菏公路来往游行，亦难补救其兵力不足。当敌人主力游来时，我则分散。地方武装（包括民兵、武工队、保田队），一面采取重点阻击，另一面组织和率领群众回避。七月底，蒋军主力七十三军、十二军进至东平时，我民兵一部于大清河岸，从北大桥到南城子，布置达五十里长的防线，阻击敌人过河。经一天一夜，敌四架飞机穿梭盘旋，集中炮火猛攻渡口，但我坚决抗击，毙敌十余名后，始安全转移。另一部民兵保田队，即配合各级指挥部、领导群众打游击，如仓邱等村，全村群众五六百人，在指挥部率领之下，安全转移到中心地区。敌主力走后，我则集中优势兵力打击土杂顽伪，一面抓紧空隙进行土地改革。八月二十五日，鄄城蒋军主力南去后，我则集中兵力围困敌人据点，该据点蒋伪七区部和三个伪乡公所还乡团等，共约二百五十余人，经我包围袭击，敌即五零七散逃奔，我毙俘其五十余，缴获战利品一部。二十七日临泽伪乡长董子琴部五十余人，到曹庄抢粮，我县大队布置伏击圈，即将其全部解决。在土顽杂伪占领区蒋军主力未到之处，敌更惊慌失措，不敢轻易外出抢粮骚扰。因此广大游击区，抓住空隙大力进行土地改革。鄄城五区三分之一行政村已初步完成土改，清理浮财，捣出粮食达一万七千余斤。在敌主力之边沿区，或敌主力经常游行地区，土顽比较活跃地区，我则集中地方武装掩护进行土改。考城将所有武装组成数十个游击集团，一面打击小股敌人，一面帮助群众分田分粮。东平县成立联防指挥部，统一领导武工队、保田队、民兵机动打击敌人，掩护土改。由于有力的坚持了游击阵地，群众情绪十分活跃。八月五日至十八日，蒋五军及吴逆化文部进占我昆山时，当地民主政府率领民兵坚持阵地，始终未后退一步；他们白天分散，夜间集中，敌人扫荡的时候，则在高粱地里搭起小棚，作临时指挥所。每逢夜晚，即插入庄内，告诉群众，我们没有走，与群众同生死共患难。并警告坏地主，不准倒地倒粮。群众知道我们未离开，莫不兴高采烈，每夜送饭送瓜，人心十分稳定。
