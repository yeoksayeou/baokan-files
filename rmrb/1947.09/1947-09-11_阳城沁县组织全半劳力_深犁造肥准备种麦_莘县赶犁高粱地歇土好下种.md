[Taoyueh (Taiyue) This paper’s dispatch on the 9th] "To plant wheat well, one must plow deeply and have sufficient fertilizer." Farmers in Qin County, Yangcheng and other places are currently engaged in deep plowing and fertilizer production to prepare for wheat planting. Bao Tou Village in Qin County has organized 100% of its entire labor force and put them into production. Before August 5th, the village had completely plowed over 350 acres of wheat land twice. The mutual aid teams are now cutting artemisia and composting manure, striving to apply 20 loads of manure per acre of wheat land, requiring a total of 7,467 loads of manure. They have already cut 1,800 loads of artemisia and firewood, which can produce 5,400 loads of manure, and will soon complete the planned target. During the campaign, several old men who had not worked in the fields for ten years also actively participated. For example, old man Guo Qi, who is 67 years old this year, was advised by others not to go to the fields, but he said, "That won't do. Young people can go to the front to fight against the stubborn enemy and make great contributions. We old men must take good care of the crops and make a contribution too!" Lin Jian Village in Yangcheng has already plowed 71 acres of early wheat land four times. They plan to apply 90 loads of manure and 30 piles of "ge zhi" per acre. Currently, they have scraped 4,120 piles of "ge zhi" and delivered manure to 25 acres of land, and 20 acres of land are used for sheep bedding. They are continuing to accumulate fertilizer. Xi Ling Village originally had 513 acres of wheat land. In late last month, they decided to expand the wheat fields to 5,530 acres, and also ensured that they would plow three times and harrow three times. Stubble wheat fields should also be plowed twice and harrowed twice. They also decided to launch a campaign to apply more fertilizer, organize the entire and semi labor force of the village to dig "ge zhen", cut cypress branches, and chop thorny vines for fertilizer, calling on the masses to strive for sheep bedding. Currently, more than 300 acres of old wheat land have been plowed twice, and there are 160 acres of sheep bedding.

[South Hebei This paper’s dispatch on the 9th] Shen County and other places are actively preparing for wheat planting. In Lu Village, Fourth District of Shen County, in order to make this year's wheat seedlings more vigorous and harvest more wheat next year, all men, women, old and young are working together. After harvesting sorghum, they are now actively preparing for wheat planting under the leadership of the village production committee. In addition to discussing accumulating more fertilizer, applying more manure, and planting wheat earlier, the mutual aid teams are also paying close attention to the selection of seeds. When selecting seeds, they mix the wheat seeds with cottonseed oil, and add 15 catties of cottonseed cake per acre, so that mole crickets dare not harm the wheat seedlings (because mole crickets are afraid of fat), and also make the wheat seedlings get warmth. Old farmer Zhang Jinyu said: "The most important thing at present is to hoe the sorghum land obliquely and clean up the grass. Not plowing the land can also make the soil loose and warm. It is often said that 'resting the soil is like resting the horse'. If it rests and has strength, the wheat seedlings will definitely be vigorous, and the good wheat scene next year will take root." Everyone agreed with this opinion, and the next day each mutual aid team began to rush to hoe the land. Yu Luoshan Brigade, a labor hero in Xisha Geta Village, Ji County, plans to plant 360 acres of wheat, and each acre needs to apply three large carts of manure. Currently, Yu Luoshan is again calling on the entire village to "harvest quickly, and free up people to plant wheat well." After the mutual aid teams harvest sorghum, in order to save effort in pulling up the roots, they immediately pick up the stalks and are pulling manure. In Ji Zexian first district, the masses in the old Chengying district voluntarily combine to help each other. Among the 54 animals in the village, 42 were jointly purchased, and 150 of the 180 households participated in mutual help and joint plowing. Xu Yuwen's team used a small donkey they bought by earning money from running a flour mill to exchange for a large donkey, and now they have added another ox. Currently, the land in the village has been plowed once, and a lot of manure has been accumulated, preparing to apply it to the land, turn the soil and plant wheat, striving to harvest seven big dou of wheat per person next year.

　　阳城沁县组织全半劳力
  　深犁造肥准备种麦
  　莘县赶犁高粱地歇土好下种
    【本报太岳九日电】“麦要种好，犁深粪饱”沁县、阳城等地农民，目前正进行深犁造肥、准备种麦。沁县堡头村已将全部劳力百分之百的组织起来，投入生产，在八月五日以前该村三百五十多亩麦地，完全犁完二遍，各互助组现正割蒿沤粪，每亩麦地争取上二十担粪，共需粪七千四百六十七担。现已割蒿子、砍柴一千八百担，能造五千四百担粪，不久即将完成预定计划。在运动中，该村有好几个十年来不上地的老汉，也积极起来上地，如郭柒老汉，今年已是六十七岁的人啦，别人劝他不要上地，他说：“哪还行，青年人能上前方打顽固立大功，咱老汉好好养种，也要立个功哩！”阳城临涧村早麦地七十一亩，已犁过四遍，计划每亩上粪九十担，圪枝三十个，现已刮下圪枝四千一百二十个，送完了二十五亩地的粪，羊卧地二十亩，现在还在继续积肥。西岭村原有麦地五百一十三亩，上月下旬决定扩大麦田到五千五百三十亩，还保证犁三遍，耙三遍，赶茬麦地也要犁两遍、耙两遍，并决定展开多上粪运动，组织全村全半劳力刨圪针、砍柏枝，刹荆条的粪，号召群众争取羊卧地。现该村旧麦地已有三百余亩犁过二遍，且有一百六十亩羊卧地。
    【本报冀南九日电】莘县等地，正积极准备种麦。莘县四区吕庄为使今年麦苗更旺盛、明年麦子多收，全村男女老少齐动手，收完了高粱，现正在村生产委会领导下，积极准备种麦，各互助组除讨论多积肥多上粪提早种麦外，对选种工作也十分注意，选种时，并把麦种用棉油拌，每亩地再外加棉饼十五斤，使蝼蛄不敢伤麦苗（因蝼蛄怕脂肪），又能使麦苗得温暖。老农张金玉说：“眼前最要紧的是把高粱地斜豁起来，把草豁净了，不拔地，又能使土质松暖，常说‘歇土如歇马’，歇的有了劲，麦苗一定很旺，明年的好麦景就扎下根了。”大家都很同意这个意见，第二天各互助组便开始突击豁地。冀县西沙圪塔村劳动英雄郁洛善大队，准备种麦三百六十亩，每亩要上三大车粪，目前郁洛善又号召全村“快打、快收、抽出人地好种麦”。各互助组割罢高粱，为了不拔地劲，马上拾了楂子，正在拉粪。鸡泽一区旧城营群众为增加生产，自愿结合互助，全村五十四头牲口中有四十二头是碰股买的，一百八十户中有一百五十户参加互助合犋。徐玉文组四家拿开粉坊赚钱买来的一匹小驴，换成了个大驴，现又添买了一头牛。现该村晒地已犁了一遍，并积了很多粪，准备上到地里翻土种麦，争取作到明年每人收麦七大斗。
