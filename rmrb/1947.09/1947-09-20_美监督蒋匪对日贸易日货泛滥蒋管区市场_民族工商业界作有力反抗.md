Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th. Since the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang announced the opening of trade with Japan, the U.S. imperialist headquarters in Japan has sent personnel to China to supervise the process. According to a United Press International dispatch from Peiping on the 12th: Axel, a natural resources expert from the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers (U.S.) in Japan, has arrived in Peiping and will consult with China (referring to the Chiang-controlled areas) on the issue of grain and raw material production. He repeatedly stated that "Japan is facing raw material difficulties," indicating that his trip is to plan and supervise the supply of Chinese raw materials and grain to meet the needs of Japanese industry. UPI also stated that Axel will also visit Sichuan, Gansu and other places to inspect China's resources. According to Shanghai news: The Chiang Kai-shek authorities are scheduled to hold a so-called "National Foreign Trade Conference" in Shanghai today (the 14th) to discuss "import and export issues" and "international trade cooperation issues." It is widely believed that this is related to the U.S. imperialist supervision of Chiang Kai-shek's foreign trade and the issue of trade between Japan and Chiang.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th. Japanese goods are now being dumped in large quantities in Chiang-controlled areas. According to a report in the Tianjin Worker's Daily on the 18th of last month: A large number of Japanese goods have been found on the Shanghai market, such as paper, medicines, and glassware, mostly produced by "Seikosha Factory" in "Yanagihara, Tomoe (county name) He (district name), Mie (prefecture name)" and "Osaka Industrial Works" in Osaka, the industrial center. In addition, according to a TASS dispatch on the 14th, citing Shanghai news: Smuggled Japanese goods are also rampant everywhere in Guangzhou. Among them are wool, silk fabrics, and fountain pens. The Tianjin Worker's Daily concluded: All of (Chiang's) China is about to become the world of Japanese goods again. According to reports in the Tianjin Minsheng Daily and Boling Daily in late last month, smuggling of Japanese goods has become even more rampant recently. Korea, Taiwan, and Hong Kong have become the three transit points for smuggling Japanese goods, flowing into North China from Korea, and into Guangzhou from Hong Kong and Taiwan, with Shanghai dumping goods into central and southern China. The smugglers are all participated in by Chiang Kai-shek's bureaucrats and have a huge organization, transporting goods by land, sea, and air, and carrying out smuggling with strong armed escorts. Customs anti-smuggling personnel have been repeatedly shot at. It is reported that there are already more than 100 enterprises specializing in smuggling Japanese and American goods in the Guangzhou area. The most smuggled goods are woolen cloth and seafood. A large number of Japanese woolen cloths have been found in the Guangzhou and Tianjin markets, with very low prices. China's wool textile industry has felt a great threat. The Tianjin Wool Textile Industry Association has protested to the Chiang Kai-shek authorities, demanding the protection of national industry and commerce, and the suppression of smuggled Japanese goods.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th. Dispatch of the 15th: Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's pro-American and pro-Japanese move to send a trade delegation to Japan to discuss the opening of trade with Japan has encountered strong resistance from the industrial sector. The Shanghai General Association of China Industry has solemnly stated that it refuses to send representatives to participate, and has issued a telegram calling on all local branches across the country to take unanimous action to refuse. Li Zhuchen, chairman of the Tianjin branch of the Industrial Association, also opposed sending a delegation to Japan specifically to discuss the opening of trade with Japan.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th. U.S. imperialists have recently been excavating secret documents related to the distribution of resources and minerals in the Northeast that were buried by the Japanese army when they withdrew from Changchun. According to a special dispatch from Changchun on August 27th in the Tianjin Yishibao: "Personnel from the U.S. Consulate in Changchun, based on a secret report from the Japanese, said that the Japanese army had buried various secret documents in a certain place in the city. They went to the site on the 26th to excavate and have obtained several documents and books. The U.S. side firmly refused to reveal the names of the Japanese informants and does not intend to return the items they have taken away. The books currently left in the police station are mostly documents related to mining." The U.S. imperialists' ambition to inherit the mantle of Japanese imperialism and deliberately invade the Northeast is exposed once again.

  　民族工商业界作有力反抗
    【新华社陕北十四日电】自蒋家匪帮宣布开放对日贸易后，美国帝国主义驻日总部已派员来华监督此事之进行。据合众社十二日北平电：日境盟（美）军最高统帅部天然资源专家阿赛尔已抵达北平，将就中国（指蒋管区）粮食与原料生产问题与中国（指蒋匪当局）协商。他并口口声声说“日本原料困难，”显示其此行乃为策划并监督以中国原料及粮食供应日本工业需要者。合众社又称：阿氏并将赴四川、甘肃等地视察中国资源。另据上海消息：蒋匪当局定于今（十四）日在上海召开所谓“全国对外贸易会议，”讨论“输出入问题”及“国际贸易合作问题。”众信此与美帝国主义监督蒋匪对外贸易及日蒋贸易问题有关。

    【新华社陕北十六日电】十五日报讯：蒋家匪帮媚美亲日派遣贸易代表团赴日商讨开放对日贸易办法一举，已遭遇工业界有力反抗。上海中国工业协会总会顷严正表示拒绝派遣代表参加，并发出代电号召全国各地分会一致采取拒绝行动。工协津分会理事长李烛尘亦反对专为商讨开放对日贸易而派遣代表团赴日。
    【新华社陕北十四日电】美国帝国主义者近在长春挖掘日军撤退时所埋藏有关东北资源矿产分布的秘密文件多种。据天津益世报长春八月二十七日专电称：“驻长春美领事馆人员，曾据日人秘报，谓日军曾于市内某处埋藏秘密文件多种。当于二十六日前往该地挖掘，已得文件书籍若干。美方对告密日人之姓名坚不吐实，其已携走之物品亦不拟归还。至现留警局之书籍，多为有关采矿之文件。”美国帝国主义袭承日本帝国主义衣钵，蓄意侵略东北的野心，于此又一次暴露。
