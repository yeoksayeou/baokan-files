Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 8th: Odds and Ends on Production and Construction in the Northeast: 1. The "Forest Railway" in the southern part of the Lesser Khingan Mountains was opened to traffic on August 20. The railway runs from Tie (on the Tie, Suihua to Jiamusi railway line) to Ergu, a total length of more than 160 *li*. It was destroyed during the puppet Manchukuo period. This time, it was completed in five months with the active construction of the Bei'an Forestry Bureau of Heilongjiang Province. After the opening of the railway, timber from the vicinity of Ergu will be continuously transported to the Tie railway station for transshipment to various places.
2.  Qiqihar City, the industrial and commercial center of West Manchuria, now has more than 3,940 factories and shops, more than double the number at the time of its initial liberation. Business in various industries is booming. The Xinhua and other four iron factories sold 6,639,000 yuan worth of goods in the second half of last year, and 23,250,000 yuan in the first half of this year. The Yongxing Bookstore's turnover was only 770,000 yuan in the first half of last year, but 7,770,000 yuan in the first half of this year, an increase of more than 10 times. From March to July this year, the democratic government lent more than 1.03 billion yuan to industry and commerce, which greatly helped private industry and commerce and small enterprises. The United Shopping Mall, which was burned down by Kuomintang secret agents in May this year, was completely repaired and reopened in just over a month after the democratic government loaned 10 million yuan. The municipal government completely exempted private textile and pharmaceutical industries from business tax.
3.  The Jidong Rural Handicraft Exhibition was held in Zunhua on the 25th of last month. The venue was posted with slogans such as "Guarantee Military and Civilian Use" and "Oppose American Goods". The audience was crowded, reaching 4,000 to 5,000 people a day. The exhibits included the well-known Yutian and Yahongqiao cotton fabrics, with more than 150 kinds of cotton cloth with different patterns, which were strong in texture and elegant in color. Other daily necessities such as gauze, socks, and towels, as well as white canvas and gray twill, were of excellent quality and were well received by the audience. Chemical and pharmaceutical products included Samsung dry batteries, alcohol, acids, medicated cloths, and absorbent cotton. The 36-spindle spinning machine independently created and manufactured by Jidong No. 8 Middle School can produce an average of three taels of thread per hour. Mineral products include gold sand from the famous Great Wall, Malanguan, and Daoliushui areas.

　　东北生产建设拾零
    【新华社东北八日电】东北生产与建设：一、小兴安岭南部之“森林铁路”已于八月二十日通车。该铁路自铁（铁、绥化至佳木斯铁路线上）至二股共长一百六十余里，伪满时即经破坏，此次在黑龙江省北安林业局积极修筑下，费时五个月完成。该路通车后，二股附近之木材将源源不断运往地铁站转运各地。
    二、西满工商中心齐齐哈尔市，现有工厂商店三千九百四十余家，较初解放时增加达两倍以上，各业生意兴隆，新华等四铁工厂，去年下半年销货六百六十三万九千元，今年上半年则达二千三百二十五万余元。永兴书店去年上半年仅营业七十余万元，今年上半年则为七百七十余万元，增加十倍之多。民主政府今年工商业贷款由三月至七月四个月中，即贷出十亿三千余万元，民营工商业及小企业得到很大帮助。今年五月间为国民党特务纵火烧毁之联合商场，经民主政府贷款一千万元后，仅月余即全部修好复业。市府所征营业税中，民营纺织业与制药业则完全免征。
    三、冀东上月二十五日于遵化举行农村工艺品展览会，会场贴有“保证军需民用”“反对美货”等标语，观众拥挤，日达四五千人。展览品中有素负盛名的玉田、鸦鸿桥棉织品，有不同花样的棉布一百五十余种，质地坚韧，颜色雅丽。其他纱布、袜子、毛巾等日用品及白帆布、灰斜纹布等质量优良，深获观众好评。化学品及医药品有三星牌干电池及酒精、酸类、药布、药棉等。冀东第八中学自创自制的三十六锭纱机平均每小时可出三两线。矿产品有著名之长城沿线、马兰关、倒流水等地之金沙等。
