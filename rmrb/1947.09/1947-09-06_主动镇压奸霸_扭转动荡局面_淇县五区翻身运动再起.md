Local Tyrants and Evil Gentry Concentrated Land: The People Yearn for Liberation

　　Proactively Suppressing Local Tyrants and Evil Gentry
  　Reversing the Turbulent Situation
    The Land Reform Movement Rises Again in the Fifth District of Qi County
    [Report from Qi County by our newspaper] The land reform movement has restarted in the Fifth District (New District). After the liberation of the Fifth District in April this year, the land reform movement began in May. Within half a month, the path for the movement was opened, 34 village chiefs were replaced, and the Baojia system was abolished. The entire district's movement surged. Soon, the enemy invaded Qi County, turning it into a seesaw environment. Furthermore, local bandits and the "Returning Home Corps" constantly cooperated to harass the area, causing the movement to stagnate. District and village cadres were not enthusiastic about leading the land reform, focusing more on burying landmines and guerrilla activities, abandoning the leadership of mass mobilization. Everyone ideologically believed that they should wait until the enemy in Anyang retreated south, Jixian was recovered, and the troops came to eliminate the bandits before the situation improved and the movement could be resumed. The county leadership convened a meeting of all district cadres to study the situation in the Fifth District, which mainly involved the following issues: First, the families of landlords who had fled and the landlords who remained at home were still spreading rumors and intimidating the masses. Second, the masses were afraid that the local tyrants and bad elements detained by the government would be released and that fighting them would be troublesome, so they dared not take their possessions. Third, although the name "Baozhang" (village chief) no longer existed in each village, most of them were still the same people who had been Baozhang and were still working for the landlords. The masses reflected that they were village chiefs when the Japanese were here, village chiefs when the Central Army came, and village chiefs again when the Eighth Route Army came, calling them "triple insured." This method of transforming the government by changing names but not people affected the mass movement. Some village chiefs even sent intelligence to the bandits, preparing to maintain the status quo, which further fueled the idea of a change in regime. Based on this situation, it was determined that the first step (August 1st) would be to remove and transfer the "triple insured," which removed a stone slab from the masses' minds. The second step was to train over 170 impoverished peasants and activists from various villages in the district, organizing them to pour out their grievances and find the root of their poverty. Immediately afterwards, on August 3rd, all landlords and the families of landlords who had fled were detained, dispelling the masses' concerns about being shot in the dark. On the 4th, a mass meeting of 2,000 people from the entire district was convened, mobilizing them to overturn their situation and seek revenge. Several bad elements, such as local tyrants Li Shanglin and Ge Jianglong, were shot dead on the spot, resolutely backing the masses. The masses all said excitedly: Now we're not afraid anymore, let's go back and do it! On the 5th, the impoverished activists who had been trained and the district cadres went down to the villages. Starting from the 6th, the movement was launched. Under the slogan of "igniting the fire in every village," by the 11th, 13 of the 34 administrative villages in the district had already held struggle meetings, overthrowing 42 landlords and local tyrants. Ten administrative villages had organized small meetings to pour out grievances and raise opinions to the landlords. Guo Village was originally the most difficult village to launch the movement. This time, the struggle was launched and the fruits were distributed in five days, overthrowing three households, including the local tyrant Wu Shun, and seizing 52 mu of land, 19 houses, 20 dan of grain, 4 rifles, 1 machine gun, and 150 rounds of ammunition. Now, eight militiamen have picked up their guns, and ten activists have emerged. The main experiences of this movement are: First, the thinking of the district cadres was straightened out, the leadership took the initiative, and the idea of waiting for the situation to improve was broken. Second, the landlords were detained and the bad elements were suppressed, backing the masses and reducing their ideological concerns. Third, the "triple insured" who could be reformed were reformed, allowing them to automatically report the things hidden by the landlords, totaling 400 mu of land, 24 dan of grain, 34 rifles, and 10 pistols. Currently, the movement is still continuing to advance. (Fan Renjie)

　　主动镇压奸霸
  　扭转动荡局面
    淇县五区翻身运动再起
    【本报淇县讯】五区（新区）翻身运动再起。五区于今年四月解放后，五月间就开始了翻身运动，在半月内打开了运动门路，改换了卅四个保长，取消了保甲制，全区运动轰起来，不久敌人进陷淇县城，变成了拉锯式的环境，再加上地方土顽会队还乡团不断配合骚扰，运动形成停滞。区村干部对翻身领导情绪不高，偏重了埋地雷打游击活动，放弃了群运领导。大家在思想上都存在着等安阳敌人南退，汲县收复和部队来消灭会队情况好转再运动的想法。县领导上召开了全区干部会议，研究了五区情况，主要有以下几个问题：一、跑了的地主家属和在家地主还在造谣威吓群众，二、政府扣起来的奸霸坏蛋，群众怕放回来，斗争了也是个麻烦，不敢要人家东西。三、保长这个名字虽各村都没有了，但大部还是保长当了村长，还替地主办事。群众反映他们是日本在当保长，中央军来当保长，八路来又当村长，叫他们是“三保险”。这种换名不换人的改造政权办法，使群运受到影响，有些村长还给会队送情报，准备维持，更加助长了变天思想。依据这种情况确定第一步（八月一日）开始撤调“三保险”，这就给群众揭了一块石板。第二步又调了全区各村一百七十余贫苦农民积极层训练，组织诉了苦找到穷根。紧接着在八月三日便扣了所有的地主和远跑地主的家属，打破群众怕打黑枪的顾虑，四日召开了全区二千群众大会，动员了翻身复仇，当场枪毙了奸霸栗尚林、葛江龙等几个坏蛋，坚决给群众撑了腰。群众都兴高彩烈的说：这可不怕了，回去干吧！五号受训的贫苦积极层和区干部下到村里去，从六号开始发动运动，在村村点火的口号下，十一号全区卅四个行政村中已开了斗争会的编村即有十三个，斗倒四十二个地主奸霸。十个行政村已组织小会诉苦，向地主提出来意见。三郭庄原是一个最难斗起来的村，这次五天时间即开展斗争并分了果实，斗倒奸霸吴顺等三户，斗出地五十二亩，房十九间，粮食廿大石，步枪四枝，机枪一挺，子弹一百五十发等武器，现有八个民兵背起枪来，并出现了十个积极分子。这段运动的主要经验是：一、打通了区干思想，领导上占了主动，打破了等情况好转的观点。二、扣了地主镇压了坏蛋，给群众撑腰作主，减少群众思想顾虑。三、改造可以改造的“三保险”，让他们自动报告给地主隐藏的东西，计有地四百亩，粮食二十四石，步枪三十四枝，八音手枪十枝等武器。目前运动仍在继续推进中。（范仁杰）
