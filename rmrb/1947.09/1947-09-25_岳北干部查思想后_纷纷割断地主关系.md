Yuebei Cadres Sever Ties with Landlords After Ideological Examination

[This newspaper, Taiyue, 23rd dispatch] After the Yuebei Prefectural Committee called for a cleansing of the targets of struggle and an examination of stance and ideology, cadres and staff in various places have been drawn into this movement. All students of the Yuebei Political and Civilian Cadre School, after complaining about the suffering caused by the landlord class, tracing the roots of their suffering, and introspecting on their ideology, have fully exposed their thoughts and actions of acting as "air raid shelters" for landlords, tipping off landlords, pitying landlords, and concealing landlords. They are now determined to break with the landlords ideologically. Comrade Feng Changyuan wrote a letter to the village farmers' association saying: "My father used to lend money at usurious rates. After this complaint session, I have realized that exploitation is wrong, and now I hand it over to the masses for disposal." Yang Zhaoyi and Hu Zhengui both wrote letters formally notifying their families to dissolve their marriage engagements with the daughters of landlords. Zhang Mingliang hid his father in a certain production unit in May of this year to evade struggle. He has now notified the village farmers' association to arrest him. Comrade Zhang Wenzhang immediately withdrew eight mu of hidden land and admitted his mistake to the masses. After studying land reform, all employees of the Yuebei Post Office also cleansed out eight targets of struggle and handed them over to the masses. The Huo County Post Office has cleansed out Wang Wenyao, a target of struggle, and sent him back to his hometown of Shibi Village. Duan Hongyi, a postal worker at the Anze Beiping Town Postal Station, resolutely broke off relations with the landlord, dissolved his niece's marriage engagement with the landlord's son, and returned everything that protected the landlord to the masses.
