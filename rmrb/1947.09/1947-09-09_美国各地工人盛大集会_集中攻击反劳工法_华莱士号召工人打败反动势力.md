Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 4th. Reports from various sources: On Labor Day, September 1st, American laborers held grand gatherings in various places, focusing on attacking the Taft-Hartley reactionary labor law. In Detroit, more than 50,000 CIO workers held a magnificent parade and rally throughout the day. Wallace delivered a speech at the meeting, emphasizing that the Truman administration's policies would lead the United States to an economic depression. In Chicago, AFL President Green addressed a gathering of more than 250,000 people, condemning the Taft-Hartley Act and reaffirming that he would oppose the "legality" of the law in court. Green acknowledged that due to soaring prices, real wages have been halved, and American workers are facing a dilemma. Prior to this, the leaders of the two major American labor unions separately published letters to American workers on September 1st. In addition to reiterating their firm opposition to the new labor law, CIO President Murray also strongly advocated that unions take political action to abolish this "shameful slave law." Murray advocated defeating any members of Congress who had approved the law in future elections in order to elect a parliament that was more favorable to workers. AFL President Green also made the same appeal and predicted that workers will devote more effort to political activities next year.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st. New York News: The struggle of organized labor in the United States to ignore and abolish anti-labor laws continues to deepen, forcing capitalists not to invoke the law. In the contract signed by the CIO's United Automobile Workers with the company last week, the provision that "workers must join the union after entering the factory" was maintained. All national leaders of the CIO and most of the AFL have reiterated that they will not sign statements declaring that they are not communists or sympathizers. Even for the CIO Fur Workers Union, chaired by the well-known communist Gold, the capitalists did not dare to invoke the anti-labor law and extended the contract. According to CIO headquarters secretary Mills, 65 percent of local unions have extended their contracts for one year. Wherever employers use the new law to attack unions, the CIO will take action. The CIO's Transport Workers Union, Government Employees Union, and the AFL's Printing Union have all announced boycotts of anti-labor measures and are fighting for their abolition. A person in charge of the York City Newspaper Guild in Pennsylvania issued a statement condemning the bill as "the first step towards American-style fascism." So far, only a few upper-level reactionary elements of trade unions have announced their agreement to the new law, such as the person in charge of the AFL's Theatrical Stage Employees Union and the chairman of the Tailors Union, Social Democrat Tobinski.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 4th. New York News: Former US Vice President Wallace recently wrote an article in the "New Republic" magazine, calling on the American working class to use political weapons to defeat the attacks of American reactionaries. Wallace said: "The labor movement has a responsibility to lead the struggle against reactionary labor as the leader of the progressive movement." He continued: "No politically concerned labor leader would now declare support for the government." Wallace condemned some labor leaders, saying that they were selling out workers due to appalling naivety or petty greed, and opportunistically expressed that they would support Truman in the next election. He said: "When our foreign policy is still supporting reactionary forces everywhere, and at home it advocates expanding armaments and popularizing military training, and using 'gentle persuasion' instead of political pressure to reduce prices, no liberal can honestly guarantee support for the government." Wallace emphasized that it is completely insufficient for workers to only measure candidates by the Taft-Hartley Act (note: Truman did pretend to veto the law, but spared no effort in implementing it). Workers cannot ignore the relationship between foreign and domestic policies. Men, women, and children sacrificed in Palestine, Greece, and Indonesia are also workers and farmers. Wallace finally said: "If American workers do not take action, then those who hold power beyond economic power will move Italian fascism and German Nazism to the United States."

### 美国各地工人盛大集会　集中攻击反劳工法  华莱士号召工人打败反动势力

　　美国各地工人盛大集会
  　集中攻击反劳工法
    华莱士号召工人打败反动势力
    【新华社陕北四日电】各方讯：九一美国劳工节，美劳工纷纷在各地举行盛大集会，集中攻击塔虎脱——哈特莱反动劳工法。在底特律，五万余产联工人竟日在该城举行雄壮的游行和集会，华莱士在会上发表演说，强调杜鲁门政府之政策将使美国走上经济萧条。在芝加哥，劳联主席格林向二十五万余人大会发表演说，斥责塔虎脱法案，重申他将在法庭上反对该法的“合法性”。格林承认，由于物价飞涨，实际工资折损一半，美国工人已面临进退维谷之境。在此以前，美两大工会领袖曾分别发表九一告美国工人书，其中除再度一致申明坚决反对新劳工法外，产联主席莫莱并力主各工会采取政治行动，以取消该项“可耻的奴隶法”。莫氏主张在将来选举中击败任何曾赞成该法的国会议员，以选出一个对工人更有利的议会。劳联主席格林亦作同样呼吁，并预料明年工人将更致力于政治活动。
    【新华社陕北一日电】纽约讯：美国有组织劳工不理与废除反劳工法之斗争，继续深入，迫使资本家不敢引用该法。产联之汽车工人联合会上周与特公司签订之合同中，仍保持“工人进厂后须加入工会”之规定。所有产联及大多数劳联之全国负责人均重申他们不签署宣布他们不是共产党或其同情者的声明，对于以著名的共产党员哥尔德为主席的产联皮毛工会，资方亦不敢援引反劳工法案而延长了合同。据产联总部书记密尔斯称：百分之六十五的地方工会，均已延长合同一年。凡在雇主利用新法攻击工会之处，产联即将采取行动。产联之交通工人工会，政府雇员工会及劳联之印刷工会，均宣布抵制反劳工办法，并为其废除而斗争。宾夕法尼亚州约克城报业公会负责人发表声明，谴责该法案为“走向美国式法西斯主义的第一步措施”。迄今宣布同意新法者，仅有少数职工会的上层反动分子。如劳联之剧场后台工人联合会负责人及裁缝工人联合会主席社会民主党人托宾斯基等。
    【新华社陕北四日电】纽约讯：美前副总统华莱士顷在最近出版的“新共和”杂志上撰文，号召美国工人阶级利用政治武器击败美反动派的进攻。华氏称：“工人运动有责任作为进步运动的领袖，领导对反动劳力的斗争。”继称：“没有一个关心政治的工人领袖会在现在声明拥护政府。”华氏对谴责若干工人领袖，说他们由于惊人的幼稚或贪图小利而出卖工人，竟机会主义地表示将在下次大选中支持杜鲁门。他说：“当我国的外交政策还是支持各地反动势力，而在国内又主张扩大军备、普及军训，不用政治压力而用‘温和劝告’以冀减低物价之时，没有一个自由主义者能够坦然保证支持政府。”华氏强调指出：工人仅以塔虎脱法案来衡量候选人（按：杜鲁门即曾假惺惺地否决该法，但执行该法却不遗余力），是完全不够的。工人不能忽视国外和国内政策之间的关系，在巴勒斯坦、希腊、印尼牺牲的男女老幼也都是工人、农民。华氏最后称：“如果美工人不行动起来，那么握着超越经济权力的人们，就会把意大利法西斯主义和德国纳粹主义搬到美国来。”
