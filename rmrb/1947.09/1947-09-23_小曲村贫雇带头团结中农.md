Xiaoqu Village

Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants Lead in Uniting with Middle Peasants

Wei Jin

Xiaoqu Village in the Fifth District of Quwo County was once controlled by landlords, feudal rich peasants, and some middle peasants were attached to them as lackeys, resulting in a period of sham struggle. Although the district had run training classes and trained activists, it failed to mobilize the poor and lower-middle peasants. Later, district cadres conducted investigations in the village, but were surrounded by feudal forces and lackeys, preventing them from approaching the masses. Seeing through this situation, the district cadres abandoned them and went deep into the masses. They initially discovered Qu Hongfa, Li Laiyong, and others. After the poor and hired peasants examined themselves, recounted their grievances, and received current affairs education, they broke through ideological concerns and all twelve poor and hired peasant households in the village were mobilized, vowing to work hard. They said, "Regardless of life or death, anyone who doesn't wholeheartedly work will be pierced through the heart by knives and guns!" However, a specific problem arose: Xiaoqu Village had a total of forty-five households, with middle peasants accounting for twenty-five, landlords and rich peasants eight, and poor and hired peasants only twelve. Among the middle peasants, some were lackeys of the feudal forces, some were two-faced, and some had committed some bad deeds. The poor and hired peasants believed that "Those with black marks and two-faced people should not be included, as they will ruin things. Big embezzlers (referring to landlords) and small embezzlers (referring to middle peasants with black marks) should be dealt with together." Some also suggested that "It's not appropriate to deal with everyone in the same way." Therefore, they studied the balance of power and realized the need to unite with the middle peasants to fight together. They figured their minor mistakes, just needed some cleaning and scrubbing.

The guiding principle was determined: to unite the middle peasants with the poor and hired peasants as the backbone. But how to begin? They first held a meeting of middle and poor peasants, and the two sides began to move towards understanding and unity. However, when it came to the understanding of the landlords' exploitation and the thoroughness of the struggle, their opinions differed greatly, and the leading role of the poor and hired peasants was reflected in how to break through the middle peasants' thinking and implement a thorough struggle line.

The key to breaking through thinking was to展开 discussions. The twenty-five middle peasants were divided into six groups, and the twelve poor peasants were also scattered in the six groups. In addition, the poor and hired peasants were formed into a group by themselves. All issues were first discussed by the poor and hired peasant group, and then brought to the middle peasants for discussion.

In the discussions, the middle and poor peasants first argued about the understanding of the landlords. The middle peasants believed that some landlords who did not exploit much on the surface, or had given them "small favors," were good people and did not necessarily need to be struggled against. The poor peasants' opinions were exactly the opposite. At the beginning, the discussion could not go on, and the poor peasants started a group meeting. Some people at the meeting said dissatisfiedly, "If the middle peasants don't work, they just want to protect the landlords." Some said angrily, "Hum! While we are struggling there, they want to protect the landlords and come up with bad ideas, we must strike them." But some others disagreed, saying, "The relationship between the middle peasants and us is not yet solid. If we strike them, they will go over to the side of the landlords, which will increase the enemy's strength." Finally, after discussion, it was decided to patiently persuade the middle peasants. If the middle peasants wanted to say the landlords were good, let them say it. After they finished, the poor peasants would expose the landlords' bad deeds. In this way, comparing the two sides, they would naturally know whether the landlords were good or not. So the middle and poor peasants held a meeting again. Middle peasant Qu Chongxin said, "Village head Zhang Wenju (a landlord) is good, willing to help people. When I was in the Xida Prison, he bailed me out. When I didn't have food, he was willing to give it to me." Qu Qingqiong said, "That year I couldn't afford the payment, Zhang Wenju even paid it for me." The poor peasants said, "Why is he so good to you? Isn't it because you are willing to help him do work, run errands, and collect accounts? On the contrary, Qu Rongmin was so poor that he had nothing to eat. When he grabbed a few ears of grain, he beat him severely." At this time, some middle peasants said, "Even if Zhang Wenju is not good, his son Zhang Yi is always good. This person doesn't exploit people, doesn't provoke people, doesn't say much when he sees people, and is very polite." The poor peasants said, "He's good, why not calculate the 'kaopan' accounts that his father exploited from us? (His father has run away) He doesn't say much when he sees people because he has money and doesn't need to ask people for food and drink." At this point, the middle peasants had nothing to say. In this way, the landlords were discussed one by one. Four groups recognized that landlords Zhang Wenju, Qu Jiaoming, Qu Fuheng, etc. were not good people, but there were still two groups, some middle peasants who were relatively well-off, who had not suffered from the landlords' "Qingjian" losses, and still thought the landlords were good. At this point, the poor peasants didn't know how to solve it, so they held a group meeting to discuss. Everyone decided to persuade them patiently, using the harm they had suffered to enlighten them. At the meeting of middle and poor peasant groups, the poor peasants said, "Some people say they haven't suffered from the landlords' 'Qingjian' losses. When the landlords were village heads and chief elders, didn't they embezzle, eat and drink, and spend everyone's money? Didn't you also pay a share of the grain and silver?" So the middle peasants thought, "Yes! I paid a lot of grain and silver, and he also exploited me." After everyone gradually recognized the face of the landlords, they discussed whether the landlords had been defeated? Whether the turning over was thorough? The two sides again caused a dispute. For example, middle peasant Qu Hongzhang said, "I see that they are fighting houses and digging up inner goods, which is much more severe than in the past. Isn't it thorough?" Poor peasant Guo Dengjian said, "Look at Zhang's family, three or four people, how many houses do they live in, what do they wear and eat?" Answer: "There are still seventeen or eight houses, and the food and clothing are not bad." "How is it compared to your family?" Answer: "Of course I can't compare to them." In this way, through comparison, everyone unanimously recognized that the landlords had not been thoroughly struggled against. Therefore, the middle and poor peasants jointly poured out their grievances, with the poor and hired peasants as the backbone, united with the middle peasants, and carried out the struggle. Of the forty-five households in the entire natural village, except for the eight households of landlords and feudal rich peasants, the remaining thirty-seven households of middle and poor peasants participated in the struggle.

    小曲村
    贫雇带头团结中农
    维进
    曲沃五区小曲村曾在地主封建富农的掌握下，中农有些人依附人家当狗腿，搞了一个时期假斗争；虽然区上办过训练班，训练了积极分子，但也没把贫雇农发动起来。后来区干部到村进行调查，封建势力和狗腿来了一个包围，使不能接近群众。区干部看穿了这种情形，便丢开他们，深入群众中去。开始发现曲洪发、李来永等三人，经过贫雇检查翻身诉苦和时事教育，打破思想顾虑，全村十二户雇贫被发动起来，大家立誓要干。他们说：“不管死活，谁不一心干，刀枪穿心！”但是接着就发生了一个具体问题：小曲村一共有四十五户人家，中农占二十五户，地主富农八户，雇贫农才十二户，而在中农中有的是封建势力的狗腿，有的是两面光的，有的多少干过些坏事，贫雇等认为：“有黑点的，两面光的人，不能要，要了会坏事情。大贪污（指地主）小贪污（指有黑点的中农）一齐收拾。”也有人提出：“不敢一概收拾。”因此才研究了力量对比的情形，感到需要团结中农，一齐斗争，他们有些小过错，只要洗脸擦黑就行。
    领导方针确定了：以雇贫为骨干团结中农。但是怎样着手进行呢？他们是先开了中贫农大会，双方开始走向谅解团结，但提到对地主的剥削及斗争彻底程度的认识，彼此意见很不一致，贫雇的领导作用也就表现在如何打通中农思想，执行彻底斗争路线。
    打通思想的关键在于展开讨论。二十五个中农编成六个小组，十二个贫农也分散在六个组里，另外雇贫农又编成一个小组，一切问题首先经过贫雇小组讨论，然后提到中农中去讨论。
    在讨论中，中、贫农首先争论的就是对于地主的认识。中农对于一些表面剥削不厉害，或者给过他“小恩小惠的地主，都认为这种人不错，不一定要斗争。”贫民意见则恰恰相反，一开始，就没讨论下去，贫农即开起小组会。会上有的人不满意的说：“中农不干就是想包庇地主。”有的人生气的说：“哼！咱在那里闹斗争，他想包庇地主，出坏，非打击不可。”但是又有些人不同意说：“中农跟咱们一势还是不巩固的，要是打击就要偏过地主那面去了，就会增加敌人的力量。”最后讨论结果，决定耐心说服中农，中农要说地主好，就让他去说好，说完了，贫农再来揭穿地主的坏事，这样两方对比，他们自然就会知道地主好不好了。于是中贫农又进行开会，中农曲崇新说：“村长张文居（地主）不错，肯帮助人，我坐西大狱，他保我，我没粮食，他肯给我。”曲清穷说：“那年我出不起款子，张文居还给我垫出来。”贫农说：“为什么他这样对你们好？还不是你们肯给人家帮忙做活、跑个腿，收个帐，相反，曲容民穷得没吃，抓他几穗谷子，他把人打得可不轻。”这时有些中农又说：“就算张文居不好，他儿张义总是不错，这人不剥削人，不惹人，见人不多说话，和和气气的。”贫农说：“他好，为什么不把他父亲剥削咱们的‘靠盘’帐算一算？（他父亲已跑）他见人不多说话，因为他有钱，用不着向人要吃要喝的。”至此，中农没有话说，就这样把地主一个个讨论下去。有四个小组都认识地主张文居、曲交明，曲福恒等不是好人，只是还有两个小组，有些光景比较好的中农，没有吃过地主的“清监”亏，还认为地主不错。这一下，贫农不知如何解决是好，便又开小组会商量，大家决定再耐心说服他们，拿他们所受到的害处，去启发他们。中、贫小组会上，贫农发言说：“有人说没吃过地主‘清监’亏，地主当村长闾长，是不是人家贪污，大吃大喝，化费的钱是大家的？粮银是不是也有你的一份？”于是中农想通了：“是呀！咱的粮银还出的不少，他也剥削了咱。”大家逐渐认识了地主的面貌后，又讨论了地主是否打垮了？翻身是否彻底？双方又引起争论。如中农曲洪章说：“我看又斗房子又刨内货，比过去厉害得多，还不彻底？”贫农郭登监说：“你看张×家三、四口人，住的几间房子，穿的吃的怎么样？”答：“还有十七、八间房子、吃穿也不坏。”“比你家怎样”？答：“咱当然比不上人家，”这样经过对比，大家一致认识了地主没有斗彻底。于是中贫农共同诉苦，以贫雇为骨干，联合中农，进行斗争。全自然村四十五户，除八户地主和封建富农外，其余三十七户中贫农都参加了斗争。
