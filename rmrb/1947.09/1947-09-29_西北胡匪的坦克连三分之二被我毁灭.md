Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 27th. Frontline reporter Du Pengcheng reported the destruction of six American-made Chiang Kai-shek tanks and twenty-five trucks, stating: At 9:00 AM on September 9th, Hu's troops, transporting grain to Qingjian in twenty-five large trucks escorted by six tanks, attempted to break through the encirclement and risk returning to Yan'an. Just as they reached 30 miles east of Yongping Town, they were ambushed by the People's Liberation Army. Amidst the roar of light and heavy machine guns and hand grenades, the leading truck driver, terrified, slammed on the brakes, causing a long line of vehicles behind to crash into each other in chaos. As the enemy frantically set up machine guns to resist, the heroes of the 3rd Company of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army had already bravely charged forward with bayonets. Liang Yinchao, the second platoon leader, and Zhao Qiren, the first squad leader, were the first to leap onto the first truck, eliminating all the enemy soldiers. The tank machine gunner on the second truck slammed shut the top hatch and firing port, intending to stay inside. A barrage of pickaxes shook the hatch door violently, finally forcing him to crawl out and beg for "mercy." After the first four trucks were taken care of, some of the enemy soldiers in the back had their legs turn to jelly and couldn't jump out of the trucks, hiding behind the cargo boxes and screaming; others rolled out of the trucks and desperately fled towards the mountains. However, those rushing down from the mountains were not Hu's reinforcements, but the warriors of the People's Liberation Army. More than a hundred of Hu's troops had no choice but to surrender one by one. The soldiers of the People's Liberation Army calmly opened the fuel tanks of all the vehicles and set them on fire, burying this batch of American imperialism's aid-Chiang killing weapons. Soldiers from another unit of ours in one breath pursued a battalion of the 500th Regiment of the 167th Brigade of the First Division, which had come from Chichi Village to escort the convoy, and wiped them out completely in three hours. As the group of prisoners dragged their numb bodies towards their destination under the escort of the People's Liberation Army, two-thirds of Hu Zongnan's only tank company on the Northwest battlefield had been reduced to a pile of broken steel.

    西北胡匪的坦克连三分之二被我毁灭
    【新华社西北二十七日电】前线记者杜鹏程报导美造蒋记坦克六辆及卡车二十五辆的毁灭称：九月九日上午九时，胡军往清涧送粮的二十五辆大卡车，载着六辆坦克，企图突破包围圈，冒险逃回延安。刚开到永坪镇以东三十里处，即遭解放军伏击部队的兜击。在轻重机枪和手榴弹的咆哮声中，为首的汽车司机吓得突然急煞车，后面的一长串汽车就慌乱地挤碰在一堆。等到敌军仓惶地架起机枪来抗击时，解放军某部第三连的英雄们已经端着刺刀勇猛地冲上去了。二排长梁银超、一班长赵启仁最先跃上第一辆汽车，解决了全部敌军。第二辆汽车上的坦克机枪射手，扣起坦克顶盖和射击孔，想闷在里面不出来。一阵洋镐打得顶盖门直震抖，终于爬出来哀求“饶命”。前四辆汽车都被解决了，后面的敌军有的腿吓软了跳不下车，躲在箱板后面惊叫；有的滚下车来，没命的向山上逃奔。但是从山上冲下来的已不是护路的胡军救兵，而是解放军的勇士，一百多个胡军只好一个个束手就擒。解放军的战士们从容地打开全部车辆的油箱，点起火来葬送这批美帝国主义援蒋的杀人凶器。我另部战士又一口气去追击由赤村开来接护汽车队的第一师一六七旅五百团的一个营，三个钟头即将其干净消灭。当俘虏群拖着麻木的身躯由解放军押向目的地时，胡宗南在西北战场上仅有的坦克连三分之二的坦克，已化为一堆残破的钢铁。
