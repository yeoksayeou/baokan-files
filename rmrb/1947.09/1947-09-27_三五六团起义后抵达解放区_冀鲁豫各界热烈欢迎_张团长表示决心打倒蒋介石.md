    [This newspaper's Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region Dispatch, 25th] After the uprising against the civil war in Feicheng by the 356th Regiment of the 119th Brigade of the 68th Division of the Chiang Army's Liu Ruzhen, they have arrived in the rear of our liberated area. Along the way, dozens of villages welcomed them with gongs and drums, and the masses lined the streets. When the 356th Regiment passed through Puyang County, the masses brought large quantities of pork, chicken eggs, peaches, pears, and other items to慰问(offer comfort and appreciation to) the marching brothers. They were in high spirits, laughing and arguing all the way, and were extremely enthusiastic. When they arrived at Jiangdian, a慰问(comfort and appreciation) delegation jointly formed by the military region, the district party committee, and the administrative office also came from afar to welcome them. Regiment Commander Zhang shook hands with each representative of the慰问(comfort and appreciation) delegation. When the regiment arrived at the camp, the common people had already cleaned the houses, and the beds and mats were all properly arranged. As soon as the troops arrived, they were led into the houses by cadres of the village command in an orderly manner.
    [This newspaper's Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region Dispatch, 25th] The Hebei-Shandong-Henan District Party Committee, Military Region, and Administrative Office慰问(comfort and appreciate) delegation and the Guancheng County government held a banquet to cleanse the dust for Regiment Commander Zhang and all the officers of the 356th Regiment of the 68th Division. At noon on the 18th, more than 50 officers of the 356th Regiment, led by Regiment Commander Zhang Gonggan, attended the meeting. The Folk Art Federation held short performances to add to the fun, and then everyone took their seats. The guests and hosts gathered together happily, and the atmosphere was extremely enthusiastic. In the afternoon, a mass welcome and celebration meeting was held. Representatives of the masses from dozens of villages in Guancheng County also offered condolences to all the officers and soldiers of the 356th Regiment. The military region, the administrative office, and the district party committee also offered condolences with 15 fat pigs and more than 40 cartons of cigarettes. Amidst the sounds of elegant music, representatives of various villages brought慰劳(offer comfort and appreciation) items such as pork, peaches, pears, and eggs, and poured into the venue one after another. Applause resounded throughout the venue. Minister Liu said in his welcoming speech: "Our People's Liberation Army has launched a nationwide counter-offensive, and the Liu-Deng army has arrived on the north bank of the Yangtze River, directly threatening Wuhan and Nanjing. This uprising led by Regiment Commander Zhang and the 356th Regiment is of great significance and points out a bright path for the officers and soldiers of the Chiang army." Minister Liu said: "The Northwest Army was a meritorious unit in the War of Resistance Against Japan. Chiang Kai-shek not only did not reward and commend them, but also adopted a policy of elimination and suppression. However, our People's Liberation Army is willing to help this unit develop and grow stronger." He then expressed his hope that all the officers and soldiers of the 356th Regiment would carry forward the glorious tradition of the past Northwest Army, resolutely serve the people, study hard, and prepare to expand the 356th Regiment based on the 356th Regiment. The applause was thunderous throughout the venue. Regiment Commander Zhang of the 356th Regiment expressed his gratitude for the help of the People's Liberation Army and the warm慰问(comfort and appreciation) of the people along the way in his speech. Talking about this uprising, he said: "Chiang Kai-shek relies on the help of American imperialism, disregards the people's desire for peace and democracy, and launches a civil war. Anyone with a conscience should oppose it. Our regiment was originally stationed in Kaifeng and was transferred to the front line in Feicheng this time to act as cannon fodder for the bandit Chiang in the civil war, so we resolutely revolted. This time we have arrived in the embrace of the people in the liberated area and this big family of the liberated area, which has given us a lot of warmth. We are determined to carry forward the glorious tradition of the past Northwest Army with the help of the People's Liberation Army, truly serve the people, and overthrow Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous and dictatorial rule!"

    【本报冀鲁豫廿五日电】蒋军六十八师刘汝珍部一一九旅三五六团在费城反内战起义后，已抵达我解放区后方，沿途数十村庄，村村锣鼓喧天，群众夹道欢迎。当三五六团路过濮县时，群众带来大批猪肉、鸡子、桃、梨等，赶来慰问行进中的弟兄们。他们情绪饱满，一路上说笑争辩，极为热烈。到蒋店时，军区、区党委、行署合组的慰问团亦远道赶来欢迎。张团长与慰问团各代表一一握手。该团抵宿营地时，老百姓已将房子打扫干净，床铺席子都安置齐备，部队一到即由村指挥部的干部分头带领入内，秩序颇为良好。
    【本报冀鲁豫二十五日电】冀鲁豫区党委、军区、行署慰问团及观城县府设宴为六十八师三五六团张团长及全体官佐洗尘。十八日中午，三五六团全体官佐五十余人，在张公干团长的率领下赴会。民间艺术联合会举行短小节目助兴，随即入座，席间宾主欢聚一堂，情绪极为热烈。午后即举行群众欢迎庆祝大会，观城县数十村庄群众代表，亦纷纷向三五六团全体官兵慰劳。军区、行署、区党委亦慰劳肥猪十五口，纸烟四十余条。在雅乐声中，各村代表带着猪肉、桃、梨、鸡蛋等慰劳品，鱼贯涌入会场，全场掌声不绝。刘部长在致欢迎词中说：“我人民解放军已举行了全国性大反攻，刘邓大军已抵达长江北岸，直接威胁到武汉、南京，此次张团长率领三五六团起义，意义殊为重大，并给蒋军官兵指出了一条光明大道。刘部长说：“西北军在抗战中是有功的部队，蒋介石不但不加奖励和表扬，反而采取消灭与打击的政策。但我们人民解放军是愿意帮助这个部队发展和壮大的。”随后他希望三五六团全体官兵，发扬过去西北军的光荣传统，坚决为人民服务，努力学习，准备以三五六团为基础，扩大三五六团。全场掌声如雷。三五六团张团长在致词中，对人民解放军的帮助，沿途人民的热烈慰问，表示感谢。谈到此次起义时称：“蒋介石依靠美帝国主义的帮助，不顾全国人民和平民主的要求，发动内战，稍有良心的人，都是要反对的。本团原在开封驻防，此次被调来费城第一线替蒋贼充当内战炮灰，故决然起义，这次到了解放区人民的怀抱与解放区这个大家庭，给了我们很多温暖，我们决心在人民解放军的帮助下，发扬过去西北军的光荣传统，真正为人民服务，打倒蒋介石卖国独裁统治！”
