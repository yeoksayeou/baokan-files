　　Consolidate Communication Organizations, Inspect Writing Attitudes
  　Shentou and Xincheng Welcome "September 1st"
    [Report from our newspaper] In order to welcome "September 1st," the fourth joint school district of Xincheng in Neiqiu First District held a meeting on August 19th. District Chief Hao also came to participate and inspected the past attitude towards communication work, discovering the following problems: (1) In the past, there was a general lack of clarity in thinking about communication work, and the village cultural and educational associations were regarded as communication groups, resulting in reliance on others and no one taking responsibility; (2) Writing稿費 [manuscript fees/writing] took a lot of effort, and failure to publish led to pessimism and unwillingness to write again; (3) Everyone felt that long articles were good, but sometimes they were not published, or sometimes only a point was selected, which also felt discouraging; (4) Writing could not grasp the timing, only providing hindsight, and good materials were outdated when they reached the newspaper office; (5) They felt that writing was not their own job, and it didn't matter to them whether they did it or not. After discovering this kind of thinking, everyone reflected on it and felt that it was wrong, and the communication group also needed to be well organized. The following future directions were proposed: (1) Strengthen the school district communication organization with the base point as the unit, with the entire school district as a joint communication group under unified leadership; (2) Establish a sound organizational system, select one head and one deputy head, one organizing officer (to organize writing), one inspection officer (to review manuscripts), and hold regular meetings; (3) In order to solve the problem of manuscripts not being published, and to promptly commend models, disseminate experience, and promote work, a "Base Point Oral Report" was created, that is, good manuscripts written, after being checked by the inspection officer, can be taken back to the village or spread to various villages in the entire base point, and praised on the broadcasting platform to promote the movement and encourage communication work. These issues were unanimously adopted by everyone. Finally, teacher Zhan Zhenxing was elected as the head, Deputy District Chief Hao as the deputy head, Liang Zhanxiang as the organizing officer, and Li Dingchao as the inspection officer. Each person made a monthly writing plan.
    Also reported: All teachers in the Shentou school district held a school district meeting on August 15th to reorganize the communication organization. Comrade Zhang Diankui from the district personally participated and reviewed the bad idea of being afraid of writing poorly and not being able to publish. Comrade Zhang talked about his experience in writing, and Comrade Liu Shanqi introduced the method of combining pen and mouth for writing, which everyone listened to enthusiastically. Finally, each person made their own plan. Before "September 1st," each person should submit three articles to the county newspaper and one to the major newspaper, and He Zhenzhong, the village chief of Xiuyi and Dahezhuang, should submit five articles, and Liu Shanqi six articles (Shentou Communication Group), and each person should still submit one article to the major newspaper. Everyone also proposed to learn the method of combining pen and mouth for writing in Shentou Village when returning to the village, lead the village-based correspondents, and organize student mass reading groups to cultivate student mass correspondents, so that our newspaper can truly penetrate into the masses, so that everyone can submit and everyone can read.

　　整顿通信组织  检查写稿态度
  　神头、辛城迎接“九一”
    【本报讯】内邱一区辛城第四联合校区为迎接“九一”，于八月十九日召开会议，郝区长也赶来参加，检查过去对通讯工作的态度，发现有以下几个问题：（一）过去普遍对通讯工作思想不明确，把村文教会当成通讯组，结果三依四靠谁也不负责；（二）写稿费了九牛二虎的劲，登不出来就悲观失望，不愿再写了；（三）都觉长篇大论的好，但有时不登，有时只择一点，也感泄气；（四）写稿抓不住火候，光放马后炮，好材料到报社已过时了；（五）认为写稿不是自己的工作，干不干对自己没啥。发现了这种思想后，经大家检讨，都认为不对，通讯组也须要很好整理。提出今后方向：（一）以基点为单位，加强校区通讯组织，全校区为一联合通讯组，统一领导；二、建全组织制度，选正副组长各一人，组织干事一人（组织写稿），检查干事一人（审查稿件），定期召开会议；三、为了解决稿子不登，和及时表扬模范，传播经验，推动工作，创办了个“基点口头报”，即把写出的好稿，经检查干事检查后，都可带回村里或传播全基点各村，在广播台上进行表扬，以推动运动与鼓动通讯工作。这些问题经大家一致通过，最后选教员占振兴为正组长，郝副区长为副组长，梁占祥为组织干事，李丁超为检查干事，每人订出每月写稿计划。
    又讯：神头校区全体教员在八月十五日开校区会议，重新整顿通讯组织，有区上张殿魁同志亲自参加，检讨过去写稿怕写不好、登不出来的坏思想。张同志谈了谈写稿的经验，刘善齐同志介绍了笔嘴结合的写稿办法，大家听了热烈发言。最后每人订出自己的计划，在“九一”前每人要向县小报投三篇，大报一篇，和修义和大和庄村长和振中要投五篇，刘善齐六篇（神头通讯组），每人仍向大报投稿一篇。大家又提出回村要向神头村笔嘴结合的写稿办法学习，领导驻村通讯员，并组织学生群众读报组，培养学生群众通讯员，把我们的报纸切实深入到群众中去，使大家投稿大家看。　　　　　　　　　（内邱大众报）
