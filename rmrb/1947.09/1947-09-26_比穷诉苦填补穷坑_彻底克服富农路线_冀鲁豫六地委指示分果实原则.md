(Our newspaper’s dispatch from Ji-Lu-Yu on the 24th) The Sixth District Committee, in order to implement filling the gaps and making up for deficiencies and to raise the class consciousness of the peasants, issued instructions on the "Issue of Fruit Distribution" on the 3rd of this month, pointing out that in the distribution of fruits, full attention should be paid to ideological mobilization. In the past, when distributing fruits, there were often some differences of opinion, such as village cadres and militia wanting to take more fruits, which peasants were not satisfied with; the Zhang family being in power and the Li family getting less, the east end being in power and the west end getting less, causing sectarian contradictions; or disagreements between middle and poor peasants, with poor peasants wanting to fill the poverty pits and middle peasants wanting to allocate according to grade; or poor villages wanting rich villages to provide aid, with rich peasants being unwilling to fill gaps for villages outside their own, causing disagreements between rich and poor villages. These contradictory phenomena are actually the struggle between the rich peasant line and the proletariat (filling the gaps and making up for deficiencies) line. We must affirm that filling the poverty pits is the strong demand of the poor peasants and also the common demand of all peasants. Our attitude towards them should not be simply to oppose and attack, but to pay attention to mobilizing ideological awareness and overcoming the rich peasant line, and to thoroughly implement the policy of complaining of hardship, uniting, and self-reporting into the distribution of fruits. Regarding the method of distributing fruits, the instructions stated: the richer villages, middle and poor peasants, and cadres and the masses should be allowed to compare hardships face-to-face and argue face-to-face. Villages should be compared with villages, households with households (comparing family property), people with people (comparing labor), and land with land (comparing quality). From this, two results will be obtained: first, the class is re-divided accurately, accusations are made against the crimes of the landlords, and the attitude of struggling against the landlords is combined; second, the peasants ideologically solve the question of "ought," so that middle and poor peasants and rich and poor villages recognize that all peasants under heaven are one family, and it is not simply filling the gaps by order; only in this way is it reasonable and legal. In the atmosphere of class friendship based on self-reporting and meritorious service, the leadership puts forward how to fill the gaps and make up for deficiencies, and allows the masses to create methods freely. It is made clear who is truly poor, who is falsely poor, and who should be given more. That is, family meetings are held, self-reporting is done for what is lacking, and democratic evaluation is made. As for the specific methods, the leadership does not need to stipulate too much and bind the creativity of the masses.

    比穷诉苦填补穷坑
    彻底克服富农路线
    冀鲁豫六地委指示分果实原则
    【本报冀鲁豫廿四日电】六地委为了贯澈填平补齐，提高农民的阶级自觉，特于本月三日发出“关于分配果实问题”的指示，指出在分配果实中，要充分注意思想发动。过去分配果实时，往往有一些分歧意见，如村干民兵要多占果实，农民不满意，张姓当权，李姓少分，东头当权，西头少分，闹宗派矛盾；或者是中贫农的分歧意见，贫农要填穷坑，中农要按等级；或者是贫村要富村调剂，富农不愿意填给外村，造成贫富村的分歧意见。这些矛盾的现象，实际就是富农路线与无产阶级（填平补齐）路线斗争，我们必须肯定填穷坑是贫农的强烈要求，也是整个农民的共同要求。我们对他们的态度是不应该单纯反对打击，应该都分注意发动思想自觉，克服富农路线，将诉苦团结自报的方针，贯澈到分配果实中去。关于分配果实办法，其指示称：要让先富村、中贫农、干群面对面比苦，面对面争论，村比村，户比户（比家当），人比人（比劳力），地比地（比好坏）。从此得到两个结果：一是重新而又准确的划分了阶级，控诉了地主的罪恶，结合斗争地主的态度；一是农民从思想上解决了一个“该”字，使中贫农、贫富村认识了天下农民是一家，不是奉令填平，只有这样，才是合理合法的。在自报立功的阶级友爱的空气下，领导上提出如何填平补齐，放手让群众创造办法，谁真穷，谁假穷，谁该多分，都弄清楚了，即开家庭会议，缺啥自报，民主评论。至于具体办法，领导上不必多所规定，束缚群众的创造。
