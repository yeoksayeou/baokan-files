　　【Reported from Taiyue on the 13th by this newspaper】The Lingshi Democratic Government is lending wheat seeds in the guerrilla areas. The Lingshi guerrilla area suffered a poor summer wheat harvest this year. Furthermore, it was looted by the Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan bandit troops. During the autumn planting season, most farmers did not have wheat seeds. The democratic government specially allocated 56,000 jin of wheat to lend to poor farmers, military families, and village cadres near enemy strongholds and militiamen active outside the Second Defense Line. The wheat has now been allocated and is being distributed.
