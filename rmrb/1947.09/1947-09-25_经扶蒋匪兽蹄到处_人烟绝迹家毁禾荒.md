Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains Front, 23rd: Frontline reporter Wang Kuang reports: After Chiang Kai-shek's 48th Division fled from Jingfu to the east of Shangcheng from the 9th to the 13th of this month, the reporter immediately went to the area for inspection. In the journey of more than 200 li from Popi River to Dalu, I witnessed more than 50 villages, large and small, including Brick Bridge, Shuangliu Bridge, Jiangjia Canal, Sangshupu, Guanshan, and Nansi, deserted and desolate. Upon entering each village, only doors and windows were found wide open, with the doors burned by the masses or thrown into ponds. Outside the doors were scattered fodder, wheat grains, and grain ears left over by livestock. Inside the houses, the stench was overwhelming, with chicken, duck, and pig feathers flying in the wind, and entrails, offal, and bloody urine everywhere. Broken iron pots and bowls were scattered on the ground, and all daily furniture was completely destroyed, leaving only piles of ashes and one or two unburnt bamboo basket handles and stool legs. Along the way, crops were either cut and pulled up or trampled. In the area east of Nansi Town, because the able-bodied men were taken away and the women and children fled, the ears of grain ripened but were left unharvested, mostly falling to the ground and rotting, sprouting into seedlings already three inches high. The fruits of the people's year-long hard work were all ruined by the Chiang bandits. When the suffering compatriots happily heard that the People's Liberation Army had arrived, they began to return from afar. When they saw that their homes, which they had guarded with their lives, had been destroyed by the Chiang bandits, they immediately beat their chests and stamped their feet, crying out in despair. Wen Wansan, a blind fortune teller in his fifties from Brick Bridge, told the reporter, "The thirteen silver dollars I saved from nine years of fortune-telling were intended to buy a coffin for myself, but they were all taken away!" He said, weeping. After returning to Jiangjia Village, two old women hurriedly searched for the girls who had been captured from the mountains by the Chiang bandits, to see if they were still alive after being raped. According to investigations, in the area from Popi River to Shuangliu Bridge alone, more than 380 women were raped after being captured from the mountains or those who failed to escape from the villages. A woman in her twenties from Shuanglun River was shot and killed while trying to escape capture by the Chiang bandits. At Tujiaao, a nursing mother and a seventeen-year-old girl were beaten to death. The Chiang bandits forcibly recruited laborers along the way, regardless of age. In Jiangjia Village, the reporter met several laborers who had escaped. One, surnamed Yao, said that they saw more than a thousand civilians being captured. Two Chiang bandits would grab one civilian to carry guns and luggage. Once captured, they were not allowed to return, for fear that they would join the Eighth Route Army to seek revenge. The laborers were beaten and starved all day long, and were beaten and scolded for the slightest delay. In Shuangliu Bridge Town, four people were beaten to death in one instance. In Sangshu, a 74-year-old man was beaten to death with a stick because he could not carry bullets. Such cruel atrocities by the Chiang bandits are arousing public outrage among the suffering compatriots. They told the reporter with tears of grief and indignation: "We must take revenge! We are not human if we don't fight these bandits (referring to Chiang Kai-shek's 48th Division) again!"

    经扶蒋匪兽蹄到处  人烟绝迹家毁禾荒
    【新华社中原前线二十三日电】前线记者王匡报导：蒋匪第四十八师于本月九日至十三日自经扶向商城以东溃逃后，记者当即前往该处视察。自泼皮河至大陆其两百余里行程中，目睹砖桥、双柳桥、江家渠、桑树铺、观山、南司等五十余大小村庄，人烟绝迹，一片凄凉。每进一村，只见门窗户壁洞开，门板都被群众烧毁、或摔在水塘里。门外散满牲口吃剩的草料、麦粒和谷穗，屋内则臭气冲天，鸡、鸭、猪毛随风飞扬，肠肚杂碎和尿屎血腥，随处皆是。被打破的铁锅碗盏零散于地，一切日常家具均破坏无遗，只留下一堆堆灰烬，和未烧完的一两个筐柄凳脚。沿路田禾或被斩拔，或被践踏。南司镇以东一带，因壮丁被抓走，妇孺逃避，谷穗黄熟而无人收割，大部落地腐烂，抽芽成秧，已及三寸，人民终岁勤劳果实，悉被蒋匪糟塌。当受难同胞欣闻人民解放军到达后，始从远处相率归来。他们见到生死相守的家园已被蒋匪破坏，立时捶胸顿足，呼号失声。砖桥一个五十多岁的卜卦瞎子文万三告诉记者说：“我九年算卦积下的十三块现洋，是预备替自己买棺材用的，都给搜去了！”说时声泪俱下。江家集有两个老太婆回来后，慌忙找寻被蒋匪从山上抓回来的姑娘，看她们被奸淫后是否还会活在人间。据调查只泼皮河至双柳桥一线，被蒋匪从山上搜捕和在村内未及逃跑而被奸淫的妇女即达三百八十余人。双轮河一个二十来岁的妇女因逃避蒋匪捕捉而遭枪杀。涂家坳被打死了一个喂奶的嫂子和一个十七岁的小闺女。蒋匪沿途拉夫，不分老幼。记者在江家集遇到逃回的几个夫子，一个姓姚的说，他们见到被抓走的民夫在千人以上，蒋匪两人即抓一夫子，挑枪挑行李；抓走后，就不让回来，怕他们参加了八路军报仇。民夫整天挨打受饿，稍一迟慢，即遭打骂。在双柳桥镇一次就打死了四个人，桑树有一个七十四岁的老头子因挑不动子弹，而被一棍打死。蒋匪此种残忍的暴行，正引起受难同胞的公愤，他们含泪悲愤的对记者说：“我们一定要报仇！再不和匪子（指蒋匪四十八师）拚就不是人了！”
