    Southern Front Our Army Victoriously Expands Gains
    Chiang Kai-shek Bandits Terrified, Morale Further Lowered
    In the past week, the People's Liberation Army's counter-offensive on the southern front continued to achieve great victories. The troops under Chen and Xie, following the victory of returning home in Lingbao Mountain, captured the important town of Shan County on the Longhai Railway on the 17th after three hours of fierce fighting. The entire 135th Brigade of the enemy's 15th Division, one battalion of the 206th Division, the entire field artillery battalion of the 36th Division, and one regiment of the Henan Security Corps were annihilated, and Chiang Gongmin, the brigade commander of the 2nd Brigade of the Youth Army's 206th Division, was captured alive. Thus, since the Liberation Army crossed the Yellow River and swept across western Henan, in less than a month, it has successively recovered ten county towns, annihilated 25,000 Chiang Kai-shek troops, and achieved brilliant results. Currently, the troops under Chen and Xie have driven 300 li deep into the Chiang-controlled area, pressing on Luoyang to the east and raiding Tongguan to the west. The 520-li railway line is free of enemy troops. The connection between the Chiang bandits' Northwest battlefield and the Central Plains has been cut off, and Hu's rear is completely exposed to the threat of our army. Chiang Kai-shek and Hu Zongnan are short of troops, terrified, and forced "Shaanxi Province to declare martial law." Chiang Kai-shek even flew to Xi'an in a panic to make arrangements to deal with the situation.
    The Hu Zongnan bandit troops in northern Shaanxi, who were surrounded by our army, were forced to retreat from Yanchuan to Yan'an. They were trapped by our army in the Chakou area, 40 kilometers northeast of Yan'an. Within an area of less than 15 li in depth, there were five brigades, one independent regiment, two division headquarters, and two army headquarters of the Hu bandits. Within three days, from the 14th to the 16th, four brigades were defeated, and 4,000 to 5,000 people were killed, wounded, or captured. The Hu bandits' deployment was in chaos, scattered and fleeing all over the mountains, and even the aircraft's communication signals were disrupted, causing them to bomb themselves. In one battalion of our army's capture of 60 prisoners, there were six different unit designations. The morale of the fleeing enemy was low, and the morale of the army had reached its limit.
    The Liu-Deng army, galloping between the Yangtze and Huai Rivers as if entering an uninhabited land, continued to expand its gains along the north bank of the Yangtze River on the eastern front, recovering Huangmei on the 15th and liberating Susong on the 17th. On the western front, they captured the three cities of Liu'an, Guangshan, and Luotian on the 17th and 18th. On the 19th, they annihilated more than 2,000 Chiang Kai-shek bandits from the 58th Division near Shangcheng, seizing a large amount of spoils. The Chiang Kai-shek headquarters still uses the method of burying its head in the sand to cover up the truth of its failure, but even the Associated Press reporter could not but admit: "It has great importance to the entire military situation in China." And it claimed: It will indefinitely delay the myth that Chiang Kai-shek advertised that the Shandong battle was nearing its end. At the same time, General Chen Yi's troops, following the southward advance of the Liu-Deng army, appeared in southern Shandong and northern Hebei. After successively annihilating 3,000 enemy troops from the 57th Division and the 5th Army, they took advantage of the victory and went south on the 16th, recovering Cao County and heading straight for the Longhai Railway. The 356th Regiment of the 68th Division of the enemy Liu Ruzhen's troops in Juancheng held an anti-civil war uprising on the 14th, led by Regiment Commander Zhang Gonghan, and joined the People's Liberation Army. The impact of the victory in western Shandong, as the Associated Press said, "This new attack by the powerful forces under General Chen Yi supplements the expedition of Liu Bocheng and Chen Geng in the three provinces of Hubei, Henan, and Anhui, and is a serious threat to the government (Chiang Kai-shek) front." And it claimed: "This attack may greatly disrupt the government military operations in Shandong and Hebei." The Jiaodong Peninsula is currently the only battlefield where the Chiang Kai-shek bandits can barely maintain their offensive by piecing together scrap iron, but it has been severely attacked by our army. One regiment of the 8th Division, of its three-pronged invasion of Zhaoyuan, was annihilated on the 18th, and the other two prongs were defeated. Our army in northern Binzhou actively carried out counter-attacks in the Rizhao and Zhucheng areas, annihilating 2,000 enemy troops, giving strong support to the Jiaodong military and civilians. After the local troops in central Shandong captured strongholds such as Huangzhuang, there are no enemy traces between Laiwu and Mengyin.
    In the Northeast, since the bandit leader Chen Cheng took charge of the Northeast Headquarters, he has been terrified of the Democratic Allied Forces' attacks. In order to consolidate the security of the Beining Line, he actively deployed "sweeping operations." On the 16th, he dispatched two divisions to invade eastern Rehe Lingyuan from Jinzhou. The enemy's 93rd Army Provisional 22nd Division (missing one regiment) and directly subordinate units advanced to Xintai Gate southwest of Jinzhou on the 18th. After only three hours of battle, most of the enemy was annihilated, and more than 4,000 enemy troops, including Deputy Division Commander Su Jingtai, were captured. Chen Cheng tried to steal a chicken but lost the rice instead, sending a generous gift. The enemy along the Beining Line outside Shanhaiguan is therefore feeling nervous.
    In the past week, local armed forces, guerrillas, and militiamen in various liberated areas have cooperated with the great counter-offensive, constantly launching fierce offensives against the enemy's remaining isolated strongholds, achieving great gains. The Taiyue area recovered Yuxiang and Jie County, the Pingxi guerrillas in the Jin-Cha-Ji area are active in the suburbs of Ping, and the Suiyuan guerrillas have extended into eastern Sui.

### 南线我军胜利扩张战果  蒋匪惊心丧胆士气益低

    南线我军胜利扩张战果
    蒋匪惊心丧胆士气益低
    一周间，人民解放军南线反攻继续获得伟大胜利。陈谢所部大军，继灵宝山还乡之捷，复于十七日以三小时激战，攻克陇海路上重镇陕县城。歼灭敌十五师之一三五旅全部，及二○六师一个营，三十六师野炮营全部，河南保安团一个团，并活捉青年军二○六师第二旅旅长蒋公敏。至此解放军自南渡黄河，横扫豫西，不及一个月，先后收复十座县城，歼灭蒋军二万五千之众，战果辉煌。目前陈谢等大军已楔入蒋管区纵深三百华里，东迫洛阳，西捣潼关，五百二十里之铁路沿线，已无敌军踪迹。蒋匪西北战场与中原之联系都拦腰斩断，胡匪之后方，完全暴露于我大军威胁之下。蒋胡兵力不足，惊心丧胆，迫得“陕西全省宣布戒严”。蒋介石更是仓惶飞赴西安，张罗应付。
    陷入我大包围中之陕北胡宗南匪部，由延川狼狈向延安逃窜途中，被我困迫在延安东北四十公里岔口地区，在纵深不到十五里的地区内，就有胡匪五个旅，一个独立团，两个师部及两个军部。自十四到十六日三天之内，被我击溃其四个旅，毙伤俘四五千人，胡匪部署大乱，满山遍野，四散奔逃，连飞机的联络信号也紊乱了，弄得自己轰炸自己。我军一个营俘获的六十个俘虏中，就有六个番号。溃逃的敌人，士气低落，军心动摇已到了极点。
    驰骋江淮间如入无人之境的刘邓大军，东线沿大江北岸，继续扩张战果，十五日收复黄梅，十七日解放宿松；西线十七、十八两日再克六安、光山、罗田三城，十九日于商城附近，歼灭蒋匪五十八师两千余人，缴获甚夥。而蒋匪统帅部至今仍以掩耳盗铃的方法，掩盖其失败的真象，但合众社记者也不能不承认：“对中国整个军事态势有极大重要性。”并称：将无限期的延迟了蒋匪所宣传山东战事已迫近结束的神话。同时，陈毅将军等部，继刘邓大军南下之后，出现于鲁冀南，于接连歼敌五十七师及第五军三千之众之后，十六日乘胜南下，收复曹县，直迫陇海，鄄城敌刘汝珍部六十八师三五六团，于十四日举行反内战起义，由团长张功韩率领全部参加人民解放军，鲁西胜利影响所及，诚如美联社所说：“陈毅将军所属强大部队这次新的进袭，补充了刘伯承与陈赓在鄂豫皖三省的出征，是对政府（蒋匪）战线的严重威胁”。并称：“这次进袭，或将使山东与河北的（蒋）政府军事行动大为混乱”。胶东半岛是目前蒋匪还能够凑合破铜烂铁勉强维持攻势的唯一战场，但已遭到我军有力痛击。其三路进犯招远中，第八师一个团已于十八日被歼，其余两路均被击溃，滨北我军在日照、诸城一带，积极活动，展开反击战，歼敌两千，给胶东军民有力配合。而鲁中地方兵团于攻克黄庄等据点后，现莱（芜）蒙（阴）间已无敌踪。
    东北方面，自匪首陈诚主持东北行辕后，日夜恐惧民主联军的打击，为谋巩固北宁线安全，积极布置“扫荡”，十六日出动两个师，分由锦州向热东凌源进犯。敌九十三军暂二十二师（缺一个团）及直属队，十八日进至锦州西南新台门后，仅三小时战斗，将敌大部歼灭，俘敌副师长苏景泰以下四千余人。陈诚偷鸡不着，反而送了一份厚礼，山海关外北宁沿线之敌，因此已感草木皆兵了。
    一周来，各解放区地方武装及游击队、民兵配合大反攻，不断对敌残存孤立据点，展开猛烈攻势，收获颇大。太岳区收复虞乡、解县，晋察冀平西游击队活跃平郊，绥远游击队伸入绥东。
