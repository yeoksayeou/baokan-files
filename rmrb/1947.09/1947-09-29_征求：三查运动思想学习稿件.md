Soliciting Manuscripts for Ideological Study of the Three Check-ups Movement

The Three Check-ups Movement is being vigorously carried out in various agencies. In addition to news reports, we are willing to provide considerable space on page four for comrades participating in the study to publish their reflections, exchange experiences, and discuss issues, in order to promote the broader and deeper development of this movement. We hope that comrades will send letters and manuscripts, and we especially hope that the study committees of various units can help promote organization and maintain close communication with us. We welcome the following types of manuscripts:

I. Difficulties and problems in learning.
II. Reflection notes, fragments of grievance or repentance, records of typical reflection reports on landlord ideology.
III. Learning experiences, self-reflection or experiences and opinions on helping others transform.
IV. Methods and experiences in promoting and organizing learning.
V. Vivid stories of personal transformation or mass exposure of landlords who are lurking and disguised.
VI. Opinions on improving and deepening the Three Check-ups Movement.

Content should be as true as possible, and the writing should be concise, but able to write about problems, regardless of the quality of the writing. The number of words should preferably be less than 2,000. Short pieces that hit the nail on the head are even more welcome. We hope that everyone will actively contribute to thoroughly eliminate landlord ideology.

(Please indicate that submissions are for page four)
