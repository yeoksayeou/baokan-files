    Weisuishan Village in Wuan New District
    Rectifies Mutual Aid Groups to Rush the Autumn Harvest
    [This newspaper Wuan dispatch] To untangle the knots in their hearts and stabilize the foundation of mutual aid, Weisuishan Village (New District) in the Third District of Wuan is rectifying its mutual aid groups in preparation for the autumn harvest and wheat planting. The Weisuishan mutual aid groups began to organize during the weeding season this year. The village has 57 full laborers, 31 semi-laborers, and 94 auxiliary laborers (over 55 years old). After a mobilization meeting, they were organized into five large groups, including 30 or so smaller groups, nominally based on voluntary association, but in reality, there were many problems. On September 11th, they started accumulating fertilizer. The rectification of mutual aid was combined with the fertilizer accumulation. At the beginning, everyone was reluctant to speak out. Village cadres and mutual aid group leaders all thought: "The partners were chosen voluntarily, so there shouldn't be any problems!" Later, starting from individual feelings and opinions about mutual aid, the political director said: "I am not satisfied with mutual aid. If I don't participate, I am a leader, but if I do participate, people will complain that my two children are weak, and I also feel like I am at a disadvantage, so it is better to lead my children to do our own work." Thereupon, everyone spoke up, raising many problems in mutual aid. For example, Cui Fenglin is a shoe repairman and has no land. He feels that earning work points in the mutual aid group is not as good as mending shoes. Wei Zengshan and Wei Er had a dispute over weeding. After everyone clarified that the current mutual aid was not solid, they discussed why the masses had opinions but didn't speak up. How to make everyone untangle the knots in their hearts? They studied that the masses had two fears: first, fear of hurting feelings and being embarrassed to bring up issues; second, fear of saying the wrong thing and being labeled as "backward" by others. This kind of thinking was especially serious among middle peasants and those with some shortcomings. Therefore, to consolidate mutual aid, this hurdle had to be overcome. Three methods were discussed: first, cadres should first make self-criticisms, talking about their own dissatisfaction with mutual aid and its impact on others; second, let everyone understand that mutual aid is long-term, and this is just the beginning, so the foundation must be stabilized, the knots must be untied, and everyone should say what they have to say; third, before the meeting, find those with opinions to work through their thinking and encourage them to speak at the meeting to guide others. After implementing this, many problems were discovered and resolved at any time. For example, when the first group held a meeting on the evening of the 13th, everyone said that when Wang Huiyuan was weeding, he put in extra effort in other people's fields, loosening the soil in the middle and covering the ends with soil. He hurriedly said: "I am not in your group anymore. Everyone dislikes me. I will join the village chief's group." Wen Fuxi interjected: "Our group doesn't want you. I have an opinion about you. The last time we weeded for the military families, you went to the edge of the village and went back to ask them to make lunch, and then claimed we asked them to, trying to please both sides." Wang Huiyuan thought for a while and said: "It is still my fault. If everyone hadn't given me feedback, I would still be in this group. I will work hard in the future." At this time, Wei Wuchang, who had been unwilling to participate in mutual aid in the past, requested to join the mutual aid group. He said: "In the past, I could barely manage weeding alone, but now I can't handle plowing 27 mu of land alone." Wei You said: "Now you see you can't do it and want mutual aid. Once we plow your land and you overcome the difficulties, you won't want it again." He said: "Our mutual aid is long-term. We can't do that!" In this way, everyone's enthusiasm rose, and then they made plans for the autumn harvest and wheat planting, and also established methods for calculating work points. (Xiang Ming)

    武安新区魏粟山村
    整顿互组赶收秋
    【本报武安讯】解开心里圪＠，安正互助根基，武安三区魏粟山（新区）整顿互助准备秋收种麦。魏粟山互助组是在今年锄苗时开始组织起来的，全村全劳力五十七个，半劳力三十一个，辅助劳力（五十五岁以上）九十四个，在一个动员大会后，编了五大组，包括三十来个小组，名为自愿结合，实际问题很多。九月十一日开始积肥，在积肥中结合整顿互助，开头大家都扯不起来，村干部和互助组长都认为：“是自愿找的对象，没有啥问题！”后来从个人对互助的感觉和意见谈起，政治主任说：“我对互助就不满意，不参加吧，咱是领导人，参加吧，人家嫌咱两个孩子弱，自己也觉得吃亏，不如带领着孩子做自己的活。”于是纷纷发言扯起互助中好多问题。如崔凤林是个补鞋的，没有地，觉着在互助组挣工米不如长鞋，魏曾山和魏二的因锄地先后发生争执。大家明确现在互助不巩固后，讨论群众为啥有意见不吭？怎样使大家解开心里这个圪＠？研究群众有两怕：一怕惹人看情面，不好意思提。二怕说错，别人说自己“落后”；特别中农和有些缺点的人这种思想很严重。因此要想使互助巩固总得打破这一关，又讨论出三个办法：一、干部首先作检讨，谈自己对互助不满意见，影响别人。二、让大家了解互助是长期的，现在才开头，根基得安正，圪＠要解开，大家有啥说啥。三、在开会前先找有意见的打通思想，在会上发言，引导别人。这样实行后发现不少问题，并随时得到解决。如第一大组十三号晚开会时，大家都说王会元锄苗时到别人地下锄吃点劲、当中松、末尾用土一埋。他急着说：“我不在你这组啦，都嫌我不好哩，我参加村长这一小组。”温伏喜抢着说：“俺这一组不要你，我对你有意见，那次给军属锄地，你到村边又回去叫人家晌午做下饭，反说是我们叫做的，两头落好。”王会元想了一会说：“还是我的不对，要不是大家都给我提意见哩，我还在这一组，以后好好干。”这时过去不愿参加互助的魏五常要求加入互助组，他说：“过去锄苗我一人还能将就，现在犁地一人二十七亩可不沾。”未有说：“这会你看不行要互助，给你犁了地克服了困难就又不啦。”他说：“咱这是长期互助，可不能那样！”这样一来大家情绪高涨起来，接着订秋收种麦计划，并订出了折工办法。（向明）
