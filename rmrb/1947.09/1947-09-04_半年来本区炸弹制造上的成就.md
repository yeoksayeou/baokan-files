Achievements in Bomb Manufacturing in Our Region in the Past Half Year
　　Yan Yuruyi
　　In the first month or two of the self-defense war, bomb manufacturing in our region was only able to supply the quantity needed, and the quality and cost accounting were generally very poor. The reason was that, under the influence of peaceful illusions in the first half of last year, military factories were converted to civilian use, and workers changed to other jobs. When the self-defense war began, the military ordnance departments did not seriously reorganize the factories, but only knew to demand large quantities from the factories. As a result, many of the bombs produced by the factories either did not explode, or had little explosive power (only breaking into a few pieces), or were prone to danger and the ignition time was very inaccurate, etc. Later, after the military region received feedback from the front, the factories gradually made some corrections. In February of this year, a district-wide bomb factory conference was held again to conduct in-depth and extensive research and discussion. The February conference determined the production quantity, quality, and methods as the guiding principle for bomb production this year. The military supply department convened a second district-wide bomb production meeting at the end of July to review the extent to which each factory had implemented the provisions of the February meeting. From this, it can be seen that the bomb production in our region in the past six months has made the following significant achievements and progress.
　　1. First of all, in terms of production quantity, everyone has exceeded the original task. The Taiyue area exceeded the most, by as much as 40%, followed by the Jinnan and Taihang areas. Generally speaking, the production in the first half of the year exceeded the original plan.
　　2. In terms of finished product quality, the progress is even more prominent. The past problems have been basically eliminated. According to everyone's reports, feedback from the front, and the results of re-testing the bombs sent to the front, the bomb fragments generally reach around 50 pieces, and some even reach more than 70 pieces. They are also moisture-proof and durable, overcoming the problem of not igniting. The bombs produced in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan area can still explode after being placed in water for 48 hours. The Taihang bombs were buried underground and watered every day. After being taken out for testing after a week, they still exploded. The moisture resistance in other areas is also very good. They have made progress in their own tests. The ignition time is generally maintained at the prescribed time of 3.5 to 4.5 seconds, and the maximum and minimum do not exceed half a second. The structure of the bombs is also more beautiful and exquisite, and can maintain safety. The bomb casing is thinly and evenly cast, correcting the problems of inaccurate bombing and few fragments. The black powder installed in the bomb casing has also been greatly improved. It is ground finely and the amount installed is consistent, so the explosive power is great.
　　3. In terms of economy, after the February conference, there was a further understanding of the cadres' thinking, so the results were also the most significant. First of all, attention has been paid to the economy of materials. The Taiyue Second Institute adopted the method of reporting accounts for materials every day, so that everyone can pay attention to the cost of each bomb and arouse the workers' ideological attention. This has not only yielded great gains in material conservation, but also greatly helped the workers' skills. The Hebei-Shandong-Henan area also has new creations in material conservation. They put forward the slogan of using every bit to the fullest in several moves, and not wasting any materials. They often extract the sulfur residue left over from boiling sulfur for the second time, and often dig up the soil on both sides of the saltpeter pot to boil it again to extract the saltpeter for reuse. Statistics show that more than 300 kilograms of sulfur and more than 1,000 kilograms of saltpeter were boiled out in this way in the first half of the year. This spirit of paying attention to saving materials in every bit is indeed worthy of promotion and learning. Secondly, in the workers' emotions, under the climax of the universal launching of meritorious service to support the front line in the first half of the year, the workers' emotions were unprecedentedly high. This is also the achievement of scientific organization of production and leadership of production, which is of particular significance for improving the number, quality, and reducing costs. The workers of Taiyue Second Institute automatically processed too much. In order to prevent the occurrence of sick numbers, the administration came forward to stop it. In addition, the movement of automatically donating money and labor to support the front line was enthusiastically launched in various districts. According to incomplete statistics, the figures are as follows:
　　Hebei-Shandong-Henan has donated a total of 11,900 kilograms of millet and 273,000 yuan of Hebei currency in two donations. Taiyue donated 229,250 yuan and 391 labor days. The Taiyue Second Institute also stipulated that 1,000 bombs should be made every month without wages. The Taiyue Third Institute designated one day each month as a day to support the front line, and did voluntary work on this day without wages. Taihang donated more than 4 million kilograms of rice, and the military supply bomb factory donated more than 3.9 million yuan (Jinnan is missing). The above totals more than 4.4 million yuan in donations, more than 411,000 kilograms of rice, and ×× labor days (there are many other miscellaneous items that have not been counted).
　　4. In terms of technical improvement: Because most of the factories still live in the mountains and are subject to various restrictions, but due to the high political enthusiasm of all our employees, and the spirit of researching and improving every bit, we have also gained a lot of creations. According to incomplete statistics, there are more than 30 large and small inventions: For example, Taiyue uses water power to drive the mill to grind black medicine, and the production quantity exceeds four times that of a livestock, and because the speed is uniform, the quality of the ground black medicine is also the best and the explosive power is the strongest. In terms of casting, Hebei-Shandong-Henan invented the use of automobile head to blow air to melt iron, and the daily output increased by more than double, and because the wind power is uniform, the quality of the melted iron is also the best, and the cast bomb casing is particularly smooth and beautiful, and the use of this power, each furnace only needs one manual labor, 95 kilograms of charcoal, and 3 kilograms of machine oil per day. The Taiyue First Institute has also improved the refining furnace. Their blower device originally required 16 manpower per day, but now it can be replaced by four livestock, which is calculated to save more than 130 kilograms of millet per day, which is equivalent to saving the expenses of 12 people. Jinnan Casting also greatly increased the output by using engine blowing. Secondly, Taihang invented a machine for punching primers, and a child can punch 20,000 per day. They also invented a machine for cutting primers, and one person can cut 100 kerosene drums per day and cut them into 30,000 primers. The Taiyue Third Institute invented safety equipment, which eliminated the workers' fear and increased the workers' production enthusiasm, and so on, which is difficult to write out one by one. These inventions and creations, in general, are the results of all employees exerting all their wisdom and creativity under the slogan of everything for supporting the front line today.

　　半年来本区炸弹制造上的成就
    延裕如
    自卫战争开始一两个月中。本区炸弹制造仅是数量上作到供应，质量及成本计算等等一般的都是很差的。原因是：由于在去年上半年和平幻想影响下，军用工厂改为民用，工人改就他业；自卫战争开始，各军械部门也未把工厂认真整理，而只知向工厂索取大批数量，于是工厂出的炸弹多不爆炸，或爆破威力小（只炸成数片），或者容易出险与发火时间极不准确等等。后经军区得到前方反映，工厂逐渐有所改正外，复在本年二月全区炸弹工厂会议再度提出深刻广泛的研究讨论。二月会议确定了生产数质量与办法，作为今年炸弹生产方针，而最近七月底军供又召集全区的二次炸弹生产会议，是为检讨各工厂对二月会议的规定执行程度，由此可以看出本区半年炸弹生产，有如下显著成就和进步。
    一、首先在生产数量方面，普遍的都超过了原订任务，太岳超过最多达百分之四十强，其次冀南太行等区都有超过。总的说来，上半年生产是超出于原订计划的。
    二、在成品质量方面，进步更突出，基本上消除了过去的毛病，根据大家的汇报，前方的反映和将送到前方的炸弹再拿回来进行试验的结果，炸弹破片一般的都达到五十片上下，还有到七十多片的，并且能防潮耐久，克服了不发火的毛病。冀鲁豫出的炸弹，放在水里经四十八小时后，拿出来仍能爆炸。太行炸弹埋在地下，每天向上泼水，经过一个星期取出来试验，仍然爆炸。其他区域防潮也很好，经他们自己试验都有进步，在发火时间上一般的都保持了三秒半至四秒半的规定时间，最多最少没有超过半秒钟的，在弹体的构造上也较美观精致，且能保持安全，弹壳翻砂很薄均匀一致，纠正了投弹偏差不命中和破片少的毛病，弹壳内所装黑药也有大的改进，碾的细致装的分量一致，故爆破威力大。
    三、在节约上，从二月会议后在干部思想上有了进一步的认识，所以收获成绩也最显著，首先在材料的节约上普遍的引起了注意。太岳二所采用了每天材料每天报帐的办法，使大家从了解每一颗炸弹的成本上来引起工人思想上的注意，这样不但在材料节约上得到了大的收获，而且在工人技术上也可得到很大的帮助。冀鲁豫在材料节约上也有新的创造，他们几次搬家中提出了点滴用尽的口号，不浪费一点材料，他们熬硫磺剩下的硫磺渣子常是再提第二遍用，并经常把提硝锅两旁的土挖起来熬一遍提出硝来再用。统计上半年这样熬出的硫磺三百余斤、硝一千余斤，这些点滴的注意节约材料的精神，的确值得推广学习。其次在工人情绪上上半年各地工厂普遍展开立功支援前线的高潮下，工人情绪空前高涨，这也是科学的组织生产领导生产所获得的成绩，这对于提高数质量与减低成本义意尤为重大。太岳二所工人自动加工太多，为防止发生病号，行政上出头制止不下。此外各区普遍的自动献金献工支援前线运动，热烈展开，现据不完全统计数字如下：
    冀鲁豫两次献金计小米一万一千九百斤，冀钞二十七万三千元。太岳献金二十二万九千二百五十元，献工三百九十一个，太岳二所并规定每月做一千发炸弹不要工资，太岳三所每月订出一天为支援前线日，这一天做义务工，不要工资。太行献米四百多万斤，军供炸弹厂献金三百九十多万元（冀南缺）。以上共计献金四百四十余万元，献米四十一万一千余斤，献工××个（其他零星物品尚多未作统计）。
    四、技术改进方面：因为工厂多还住在山沟里，受着种种的限制，但由于我们全体职工的高度政治情绪，发挥了一点一滴钻研改进的精神，也获得了不少的创造。现据不完全统计，大小发明共达三十多种：如太岳碾黑药改用水力带碾子，生产数量超过了一匹牲口的四倍，并且因速度均匀，碾出的黑药质量也最好，爆炸力最强。在翻砂上，冀鲁豫发明利用汽车头鼓风化铁水，每天产量增加一倍以上，并因风力大小均匀，化出的铁水质量也最好，翻出的弹壳特别光滑美观，而使用此动力，每天一盘炉只需一个人工、九十五斤木炭、三斤滑机油则可。太岳一所炼炉也有改进，他们的鼓风装置原每天需十六个人力，后改用四匹牲口即可代替了十六个人力的工作，计算每天可节省小米一百三十多斤，等于节约十二个人的开支。冀南翻砂改用发动机鼓风产量亦大为增加。其次如太行发明冲底火机器，一个小孩一天可冲两万个。又发明剪底火机器，一人一天可剪一百个煤油筒，并剪成三万个底火。太岳三所发明防险设备，消除了工人的畏惧心理，增高了工人的生产情绪，如此等等难以条条写出。这些发明和创造，总的说来是全体职工在今天一切为了支援前线的口号下，发挥了一切智慧和创造性所换得的成果。
