　　Xingtai Pangma Village Calculates Autumn Harvest Labor
  　Squeezes Out Manpower for Sideline Production
    [This newspaper, Xingtai dispatch] Pangma Village, in the Second District of this county, is a relatively large village with a traditional market day occurring on the 3rd and 8th of the month. On the evening of the 15th of this month, the village cadres and masses began discussing the autumn harvest. Instructor Wang Bin suggested: "The autumn season, with its varied crops, requires careful planning. We must simultaneously manage the autumn harvest and engage in sideline production, laying the groundwork for a full-scale push for prosperity through sideline production during the slack season." Wang Bingxin, chairman of the Farmers' Association, said: "My group has planted a total of ninety-six mu of autumn crops. With nine male and female laborers, it will take an average of two laborers per mu to complete the harvest. This means a total of one hundred and ninety-two labor days. We estimate we can finish harvesting all of our autumn crops in twenty-one days. Because the autumn crops ripen unevenly, we have decided to dedicate five laborers to the autumn harvest and free up four laborers to engage in sideline production. My group has already accumulated a capital of 60,000 yuan and plans to open a small cooperative. We will also allocate one stone and five dou of wheat to the women to grind flour." His speech influenced the village cadres and masses. Each group initiated detailed plans that evening, carefully allocating labor, and engaging in enthusiastic discussions about sideline production. After deliberation, by the evening of the 16th, it was calculated that the village cadres and masses had collectively raised a capital of 1.6 million yuan. On the 17th, they set off separately to work, some harvesting, some going to Xingtai City to purchase goods, and others tidying up their houses. By the 18th, the whole village had added fifteen establishments, including oil presses, small cooperatives, general stores, bamboo shops, and farm implement shops. When the stores opened, the village cadres and masses proposed the slogan: "Guarantee market prosperity, each group must run a store well as a sideline, and challenge Xin Chang Village (which also has a market) to see who has a better autumn harvest and which village has a more prosperous market!" (Yu Min)
    [This newspaper, Jinnan dispatch, 13th] Gan Laoying, a labor model in Huozhai Village, Fourth District, Qiuxian County, convened a meeting of mutual aid team leaders on August 13th to calculate the harvest and determine how to supplement any shortfalls with sideline production. The village has a total of 1,950 mu of autumn seedlings (all late seedlings). Calculated at 60% yield (80 jin of grain per mu), the total harvest is 156,000 jin. This year's wheat harvest was 40,000 jin. In addition, 57 mu of melons were planted, with a yield equivalent to 4,000 jin of grain, and 2,500 jin of jujubes were harvested, equivalent to 5,000 jin of grain. The total annual agricultural income is 205,000 jin. The village has 290 people, each needing 2 jin of grain per day, totaling 708,800 jin. Oil, salt, and sundries cost 50 yuan per person per day, requiring 170,400 yuan annually, equivalent to 1,740 jin of grain. The village bears a land burden of 10,060 mu, with an autumn tax of 4 jin of grain per mu, requiring 40,200 jin. In total, the village's annual income is compared with its expenses, and there is still a grain shortage of 45,740 jin. Therefore, it was decided to mobilize women to participate in the autumn harvest and accumulate manure, prepare to plant more wheat, and universally engage in sideline production. Nine out of ten mutual aid teams are preparing to grind bean flour when the new beans come down. Each day, nine teams can grind 400 jin of beans, earning 100 jin of beans. Women's spinning: 82 people, each spinning 3 liang of thread per night. Each jin of thread earns 1,000 yuan, yielding 3.69 million yuan annually, enough to buy 36,900 jin of grain. According to this calculation, in addition to supplementing the shortfall, there will also be a surplus of 12,160 jin of grain.

　　邢台庞马村计算收秋劳力
  　挤出人力搞副业
    【本报邢台讯】本县二区庞马村，是一个较大村庄，历来就有逢三排八的集期。该村干群于月之十五日晚，开始讨论秋收，指导员王彬提出：“秋三月，麦十天，秋天庄稼活比较琐碎，咱们要一面秋收，一面结合搞副业，预先打下农闲时全力搞副业致富的基础。”农会主席王秉信说：“我组共种秋庄稼九十六亩，男女劳力九个，每亩平均用两个劳力就收完了，共计用一百九十二个劳力，在二十一天内就把全组的秋庄稼收完啦，因为秋庄稼熟的不齐节，决定用五个劳力秋收，腾出四个劳力来搞副业，现在我组已积资金六万元，准备开一个小型合作社，另外拿出麦子一石五斗，叫妇女们磨面。”他的发言影响了全村干群，各组当晚展开了精确计划，妥慎分配劳力，结合副业的热烈讨论。经酝酿后，至十六日晚，统计全村干群共集出资金百六十万元，十七日即分头去干，收秋的收秋，赴邢台市购货的购货，在家收拾房子的收拾房子，到十八日那天，全村共计添油坊、小型合作社、杂货店、竹货店、农具店等十五家，商店开了张，全村干群提出口号：“保证市场繁荣，每一组要搞好一家商店作副业，并向心长村（该村也有集）挑战，看谁的秋收好，看那一村的市场繁荣。”（育民）
    【本报冀南十三日电】邱县四区伙寨村干劳英，于八月十三日召开互助组长会议，计算年成，确定以副业补充不足。该村共秋苗（皆晚苗）一千九百五十亩，按六成计算（每亩收粮八十斤），共收十五万六千斤，今年收麦四万斤。另外种瓜五十七亩，收成可顶四千斤粮食，收枣二千五百斤，能顶粮食五千斤。合计全年农业收入共廿万零五千斤。全村二百九十口人，每人每天需粮二斤，共需要七十万八千八百斤，油、盐、零用每人每天按五十元，全年需洋十七万零四千元，折粮一千七百四十斤。全村负担地一万零六十亩，秋征每亩以四斤粮计，需四万零二百斤，总计全村全年收入与开支对比，尚缺粮四万五千七百四十斤。于是确定动员妇女参加秋收、积肥，准备多种麦，普遍搞副业。十个互助组有九个组准备新豆下来磨粉，每天九个组，能磨四百斤豆，即赚豆一百斤，妇女纺织，八十二人，每人每晚纺三两线，每纺一斤，可赚一千元，全年可赚三百六十九万元，可买粮食三万六千九百斤。如此计算，除能补充不足，还可节余粮食一万二千一百六十斤。
