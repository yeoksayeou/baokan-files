Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 11th. Since the East China People's Liberation Army captured Feicheng, Linxian, Zaozhuang and other places in early July, annihilating one and a half enemy brigades, the situation in Lu Nan has undergone significant changes. The Chiang army's garrison forces in Lu Nan have been greatly weakened, and those entrenched in the mountainous areas number less than one brigade. As of now, with the exception of a few strongholds such as Baiyan, Chengqian, Pingyi, and Lanling in the mountainous center, most areas are without the enemy's main force. People's guerrilla warfare has been widely carried out, and the core regiments, which have obtained a significant amount of American equipment, have conducted sweeps against the Chiang-puppet "Homecoming Corps", annihilating more than a thousand of them and expelling most of them from the mountainous areas. Under the PLA's awe-inspiring power and the influence of its lenient policy, those who had been deceived into supporting Chiang Kai-shek repented and returned, causing the Chiang army to lose its eyes and ears and fall into a state of isolation and helplessness. Now, the people's armed forces, having achieved repeated victories, have greatly improved their equipment and boosted their confidence, and are giving the Chiang army even stronger blows.

　　鲁南蒋军守备削弱陷于孤立无援之境
    【新华社山东十一日电】自华东解放军于七月上旬一度攻克费城、临县、枣庄等地歼敌一个半旅后，鲁南形势发生重大变化。蒋军在鲁南守备兵力，大为削弱，其盘踞山区者，不足一个旅。截至目前为止，山区中心除白彦、城前、平邑、兰陵等少数据点外，大部地区均无敌之主力。人民游击战广泛开展，获有不少美械装备的基干兵团，曾对蒋伪“还乡团”进行扫荡，歼灭其千余人，并将其大部驱逐于山区之外。在解放军威震与宽大政策感召下，一时被骗附蒋分子纷纷悔悟来归，使蒋军失去耳目，陷于孤立无援之困境，现人民武装因迭获胜利，装备大为改善，信心百倍提高，正予蒋军以更强有力的打击。
