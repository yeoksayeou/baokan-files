Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 5th. The Yan'an County Guerrilla Force captured a diary belonging to Xu Chengdong, a company commander in the Chiang army's Transportation Battalion, which exposed the rare brutality of the Chiang army in abusing and killing new recruits, and revealed the war-weariness and degeneracy of the Chiang army. Xu wrote on March 10th, "Along the way there were sick soldiers, mostly new recruits. Two were buried alive. One was buried on the side of the road, with his head exposed. He was not yet dead. I used a shovel to remove the mud pressing on him. He said he was a soldier of the First Company of the 430th Regiment. Because he could not walk, the platoon leader ordered the squad leader to bury him alive. At the time, his squad leader was monitoring from 200 meters away. At the same time, a platoon leader was about to bury a thin Henan person. That soldier was just unable to walk. I said to the sick soldier, 'As long as you can walk, you will definitely not be buried.' He didn't listen, covered his head with white cloth, and took off his military uniform, preparing to lie down in the pit. I couldn't bear to watch when he was buried alive, so I left. Another sick soldier saw a pit dug for him and trembled with fear." On March 31st, he wrote, "…Four new recruits died on the road. They mostly became sick during long marches. One was shot because he could not walk." Those who are sick are buried alive and shot, and those who are alive are also heading towards the same fate. "On April 2nd, I first went to the 7th and 8th squads to see the livestock. A dim, bean-sized lamp shone on the sallow faces of the new brothers. I knew that their hearts were full of sorrow." "Being in Yan'an is like being trapped in a cage. The supplies needed every day have become a big problem. There is no vegetable oil to eat, the stomach gradually swells, there is a lack of nutrition, checking posts at night, going to bed late and getting up early, the spirit suffers greatly… The military and political work of the Central Army is far inferior to the strength of the Communists." (April 13th) This company commander, whose stomach was expanding, was also frequently disturbed by "the sound of artillery fire at night, waking up from a sweet (?) dream (April 20th)," so he shouted, "I can't stand the boredom of the environment" (April 31st). The final way out is "I love money and am intoxicated by money..." "Open my pillow and find better new clothes, tomorrow I will decide to sell them to the casino to try my luck." (Same day)

　　陕北蒋军活埋新兵
  　内部厌战堕落情绪大增涨
    【新华社西北五日电】延安县游击队缴获蒋军辎重营某连连长徐承栋日记一册，暴露了蒋军人间少有的虐杀新兵的暴行并透露出蒋军的厌战堕落情绪。徐在三月十日记着“沿途有病兵，大多数是新兵，活埋两名，一名被埋在路边，头部露在外面，还没有死。我用铲子铲去压在他身上的泥，他说是四三○团第一连的小兵，因为走不动，排长叫班长把他活埋了，当时他的班长还在二百公尺外监视。同时，一个排长正要埋一个瘦弱的河南人，那个兵只不过是走不动，我对那病兵说：‘只要你能走，绝对不会埋你。’他不听，自己用白布蒙上头，脱掉军衣预备睡下坑去。被活埋时，我不忍心看便走了。还有一个病兵看见为他挖好的一个坑，吓得发抖。”三月三十一日写着“…………路上死新兵四名，他们多因在长途行军中拖病了的，内有一名因不能行走而被枪毙。”病了的被活埋枪毙，活着的也正在走向同样的命运。“四月二日我首先到七、八班那里去看牲口，一盏豆大的孤灯照着新弟兄枯黄的脸，我知道他们的内心是万般的愁苦。”“在延安有如困在牢笼里一样，每天所需要的给养成了大问题，没有菜油吃，胃部逐渐胀大，缺乏营养，晚上查岗，晚睡早起，精神大受损失…………中央军的军政工作，远不如共党的坚强。”（四月十三日）这位胃部扩张的连又加上经常发生“夜来响起炮声一阵，惊醒了甜密（？）的美梦（四月二十日），”于是叫喊“我受不了环境的烦闷，”（四月三十一日）最后的出路是“我爱钱也为金钱而沉醉……”“打开我的枕头寻出较好的新衣，明天决定卖掉到赌场中去碰碰运气。”（同日）
