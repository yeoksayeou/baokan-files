　　Tightly Integrate with Military Training
    Li Yun
  　——An Example of Art Serving the Military
    During the military training of the Second Engineering Brigade of the Military and Political University, the art and literary work was tightly integrated with military training, achieving complete penetration and fully utilizing the power of art and literary work, solving the problem of how soldiers can master the weapon of art. In the art movement of the past year, students and cadres accounted for the majority, making it easier to carry out art and literary work. This year, the Engineering Brigade is entirely composed of liberated peasants who have just come to the army from the countryside, 98% of whom are illiterate, with only a few who can recognize a few hundred characters. Facts have proved that the art movement can also be carried out among them.

    Three Principles

    At the beginning of the military training, after learning from the experience of carrying out the art movement in the first phase of military training, the leadership considered three principles: First, comprehensive integration: that is, to ensure that drama, music, blackboard newspapers, clappers, ditties, broadcasting, painting, etc., can all be integrated with military training, and not allow any form of art or literary activity to be divorced from military training.

    Second, rapid integration: strive for art and literary activities to precede military training or be integrated with military training activities to fully exert their guiding role and not allow art and literary activities to be an afterthought.

    Third, proactive integration: highly leverage the flexibility of art and literary activities, so that art and literary activities proactively integrate with military training activities, and carry out activities wherever military training is conducted, not fixed in classrooms or dining halls.

    Integration Methods

    1. Sing about what you learn—Music integration has always been poor in the past, but this time it was done well. A song was composed for each subject and each assignment, which played a great motivating role. When we started learning about blasting, we composed a bomb song, then learned about landmines, and composed a landmine song. When the meritorious service campaign began, we sang the meritorious service campaign song, and during the half-hour "August 1st" commendation rally, we sang the "August 1st" commendation song. When we learned to build bridges, we immediately taught the "Seven Not Afraids" song. The characteristics of combining a week of political study with learning a song about "laying down baggage" are: (1) The song is composed before each task mobilization and taught during the mobilization, and sung frequently during military training. (2) The content of the song is the content of the study, including mobilization slogans and key points of the subject. (3) Familiar old tunes or short, easy-to-sing tunes are used, and the lyrics are often repeated, so they are easy to learn.

    2. Act out what you learn—Beautifying the activities in learning becomes a play, and a dialogue between two or three people about the learning content is also a play. When learning blasting, each class beautifies the most crucial part of their actions. Combining military actions with political activities and performing them is a play. The seventh class's performance of continuous forced blasting received good reviews at the brigade's evening party and promoted the company's drama activities. The subsequent performances of commendation and mutual aid groups were also very good plays. Each class independently created three programs for the company-level army-people evening party, which was quite successful.

    3. Broadcast what you learn—Radio stations have become the most popular and lively form of mass entertainment. In the dining hall, various ditties, Peking opera, Luoziju, @@, folk tunes, clappers, etc., broadcast the day's learning and life experiences. Here, cadres, students, and administrative staff praise each other, forming a upsurge. More than 80% of the entire team participated in broadcasting, showing their talents like the Eight Immortals crossing the sea. Almost every meal collapsed the dining hall. Here is a lively market. With advantages and experiences, the masses immediately compose various tunes to sing here. Since then, we have emerged many clapper experts (including those who do not recognize a single character), broadcasting commanders... broadcasting more than 600 times a month, and composing 180 clappers, one of whom composed more than 40.

    4. Put on the blackboard newspaper what you learn—Blackboard newspapers have developed from one for the entire company to one for each class and one for each mutual aid group. Now some classes produce one for each person (class nine). After arousing the enthusiasm of the masses, everyone wants to express their opinions and show off their skills. People who recognize dozens of characters put out newspapers with a dozen characters (called "rough blackboard newspapers") or draw a picture and write a few words, such as: "Pang Baoshan studied very hard today," and then draw a person next to it, writing the name of the praised person on his belly, which is an issue of the blackboard newspaper. Because many blackboard newspapers are produced and few people are literate, it has developed into a combination of broadcasting and blackboard newspapers, similar to a peep show, pointing to the characters and pictures on the blackboard, explaining, gesticulating, and singing. This form itself is a combination of several forms of art, music, drama, and painting. Now 50% of the comrades in the entire company can produce blackboard newspapers. The dining hall courtyard is full of them. Everyone jokingly says that the "blackboard newspapers are leaning against the west wall."

    5. A form that combines slogans, music, technology, and culture—The mutual aid group of the third class created this form: the mobilization slogans and key learning points proposed at the mobilization meeting are composed into songs, and the more literate comrades in the group teach them to the less literate comrades! While singing, they learn words and memorize key points. All three can be learned and remembered firmly.

    6. Wherever you study, art and literary work goes there—When doing forced blasting training in × County, the team set off dancing the Yangge, and returned in the evening dancing the Yangge, followed by a loudspeaker and blackboard newspaper. During field operations, broadcasting was combined with operation command. While conducting operation guidance on the city wall, encouragement and praise were given, and the blackboard newspaper became a flying blackboard newspaper, carried around everywhere. When learning to build bridges, broadcasting was carried out by districts, and experiences were exchanged in a timely manner, and good comrades were praised in a timely manner, resulting in battlefield clappers. The learning atmosphere was extremely active. There were constant ditties, clappers, singing, and other activities in the classroom and dining hall.

    How to mobilize?

    1. Lower requirements and start from the requirements of the masses—It is important to carry out the art and literary work of soldiers. That is, starting from the level of the masses themselves and gradually improving. Losing confidence in them and transporting the set of student brigades is inappropriate. Regarding drama, we proposed "just take a walk on stage"; regarding music, we advocated "open your mouth"; regarding broadcasting, we advocated "say what you have to say, do what you can do"; regarding blackboard newspapers, we proposed "a few hundred words are not too many, and one word is not too few." Because the requirements are low, everyone dares to try, and gradually opens up breakthroughs and expands.

    2. Affirmation—The leaders affirm whatever the soldiers bring out, point out where it is good, call on everyone to learn from him, and encourage him to improve further. Timely discovery and timely affirmation play the most important role. Everyone sees that he has been praised by the leaders for this point, and is unwilling to fall behind and catch up with each other.

    3. Give importance—The cultural and recreational activities were regarded as part of the summary of the work, time was given to the cultural and recreational activities comrades during the regular time, and the efforts of cultural and recreational activities were rewarded with materials. In this way, everyone is willing to participate actively.

    4. Cadres personally do it—It is not enough to just call on, we must help by doing it ourselves, grasp a successful one to promote everyone (such as for the organization of the play, and constantly propose a certain class blackboard newspaper as a direction), a layer of mysterious paper is pierced, and everyone follows up, otherwise, there are many concerns and traditional habits that prevent soldiers from participating in art and literary activities.

    5. Cadres take the lead—Cadres take the lead in participating in Yangge dancing; cadres perform programs themselves or participate in classes in acting; cadres broadcast as usual (all the cadres in the team have broadcasted), and the masses see that the cadres are doing it, so they have fewer concerns.

　　紧紧和练兵结合
    立云
  　——文艺为兵之一例
    军政大学第二期工兵队在练兵中，文艺工作紧紧结合了练兵，做到了无孔不入，充分发挥了文艺工作的威力，解决了战士如何掌握文艺武器这个问题。去年一年的文艺运动中，学生和干部成份占多数，文艺工作容易开展，今年，工兵队全部是刚从乡下来到部队的翻身农民，百分之九十八不识字，只有几个人能识几百字，事实证明：文艺运动在他们中间也可以开展。
    三个方针
    练兵之初，接受了第一期练兵中开展文艺运动的经验，领导上考虑了三个方针：第一、全面结合：即是使戏剧，音乐，黑板报，快板，小调，广播，图画等全部能做到结合练兵，不让任何一种文艺形式，文艺活动和练兵脱节。
    第二、迅速结合：力求文艺活动走在练兵前面，或和练兵活动结合一起，充分发挥其指导作用，不让文艺活动打马后炮。
    第三、主动结合：高度发挥文艺活动的灵活性，使文艺活动主动地去结合练兵活动，在那里练兵就在那里活动，不固定在课堂上，饭场上。
    结合方法
    一、学啥唱啥——在音乐上过去结合一贯是差的，这次作得好，一个课目，一个任命都编出歌子唱，鼓动作用很大；开始学爆破编了炸药包，接着学地雷，又编地雷歌，立功开始唱立功运动歌、学坑道唱坑道歌，“八一”贺功半点钟唱会“八一”贺功歌，学架桥马上又教会七不怕。一周的政治学习，学了放包袱歌子结合学习的特点是：（一）每个任务动员之前就把歌编好，动员时就教会，练兵期间经常唱。（二）歌子内容就是学习内容，里面有动员口号，有课目要领。（三）用的是群众熟悉的旧调子，或士兵易唱节拍简短的调子，歌词多重复，一唱就会。
    二、学啥演啥——把学习中的活动美化一下就是戏，把学习内容三两人对唱一段也是戏，学爆破各班就把本班最紧的一段动作美化起来，军事动作加上政治活动演出来就是戏，七班演的强行连续爆破在大队晚会上得到好评，并推动了连队戏剧活动。接着演出的贺功，互助小组，都是很好的戏，连队军民晚会上各班自编了三个节目演出，颇为成功。
    三、学啥广播啥——广播电台已成最普遍最活泼的群众文娱活动形式，饭堂上五花八门的小调、京剧、落子、＠＠、土调、快板等把一天的学习、生活经验、全部广播出来，在这里干部、学员、事务人员互相表扬形成热潮，全队百分之八十以上的人参加广播，八仙过海，各显神通，每顿饭都几乎唱塌了饭棚子，这里是个热闹的市场，有了优点、经验，群众立即编成各色调子在这里唱，从此我们涌现出许多快板专家，（还有不识一个字的）广播司令………一月广播六百多次，编出一八○个快板，其中一人编了四十多个。
    四、学啥黑板报出啥——黑板报由全连一块，发展到一班一块，一互助组一块，现在有的班一人出一块（九班）。群众积极性发动起来之后，谁都想发表点意见，显一显本领，识几十个字的人就出十几个字的报（名叫“老粗黑板报”，）或者画上一个画，写上几个字，例如：“庞保山今天学习很卖力气”，旁面再画个人，在肚皮上写上被表扬者的名字，就是一期黑板报了。黑板报出的多，识字的人少，就发展到广播和黑板结合，类似拉洋片形式，一面指着黑板上的字画、一面讲一面比画，一面唱出来，这个形式本身就是文艺、音乐、戏剧、图画几种形式的结合，现在全连已有百分之五十的同志会出黑板报，饭堂院里摆得满满的，大家开玩笑的要“黑板报靠倒了西墙。”
    五、口号。音乐、技术、文化结合的一种形式——三班互助小组创造了这种形式：动员会上提出的动员口号学习要领编成歌子，到小组里由识字多的同志教给识字少的！一面唱歌，一面学字，一面记要领，三样都能学会记牢。
    六、在哪里学习，文艺工作就到哪里活动，——在×县城关作强行爆破学习时，队伍扭着大秧歌出发，晚上扭着大秧歌回来，队伍后面跟着喇叭筒，黑板报。野外作业时，广播和作业指挥结合起来，一面在城头上进行作业指导，一面鼓动表扬，黑板报成了飞行黑板报，抬着到处走。架桥学习时，以区队为单位广播，经验及时得到交流，好的同志及时得到表扬，出现了战场快板。学习情绪极为活跃。课堂饭堂更不断有小调快板唱歌等活动。
    如何发动起来？
    一、降低要求，从群众要求出发——开展战士的文艺工作这一条是重要的。就是从群众自己的水平出发，逐步提高，对他们失掉信心，搬运学生大队的一套都是不恰当的。关于戏剧我们提出“出来走一趟就行”，关于音乐我们提倡“张开嘴”；关于广播，我们提倡“有啥说啥，会啥来啥”，关于黑板报，我们提出“几百字不嫌多，一个字不嫌少”。因为要求低，大家也敢尝试，遂逐渐打开缺口扩大起来。
    二、肯定起来——战士们拿出来一点，领导上就肯定一点，指出他好的地方在那里，号召大家跟他学，劝他再提高。及时发现及时肯定最起作用，大家看到他这点受到领导上表扬，不甘落后，相率赶上。
    三、予以重视——总结工作时把文娱活动作一项，平时给文娱活动同志以时间，评功选模也算一条，文娱工作出了力予以物资奖励，如此谁也愿意积极参加。
    四、干部亲自动手——光号召不行，必须动手帮助，抓住一个成功的推动起大家（如对于戏的组织，和不断提出某某班黑板报作为方向），一层神秘的纸戳破，大家就跟上来，否则，有很多顾虑和传统习惯妨碍战士参与文艺活动。
    五、干部带头干——扭秧歌干部带头参加；演戏干部自己出演节目或参加到班里去；广播干部照样干（全队干部都广播过），群众见干部干，自己顾虑也就少了。
