Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 3rd. News circles in the four major cultural centers of the Northeast Liberated Area, namely Harbin, Qiqihar, Yanji, and Tonghua, enthusiastically commemorated "September 1st" Journalists' Day. A meeting was held in Harbin on the afternoon of the 1st, attended by more than 150 representatives from Northeast Daily, Harbin Gazette, Harbin Worker-Peasant Daily, Noon News, Dihua Daily, Harbin Daily, Northeast Pictorial, and the Northeast Branch of our agency. In addition to discussing how to improve future work, the meeting also reorganized the city's Journalists Association. Zhao Zhanpeng, the president of Noon News, the oldest private newspaper in the city, said in his speech: "Today's newspaper publishing is fundamentally different from the past. Last year, in order to make a profit, we adopted the old method of publishing 'scandalous news' in large amounts. Unexpectedly, the circulation dropped from 1,000 copies a day to 800 copies. Later, with the help of the Journalists Association, we quickly changed our policy and reported on the various emancipation lives of the citizens. Circulation soared to 4,000 copies. This proves that the thoughts and emotions of the people in the liberated areas today have undergone great changes compared to the past." The former chairman of the Journalists Association, Guan Hongyi, praised the democratic government's vigorous support for the achievements of various private newspapers. In April of this year, when the funds of the newspapers were most difficult, the Industry and Commerce Daily, the Harbin Gazette, and the Noon News each received a loan of 300,000 yuan (each yuan is equivalent to 10 National Currency) from the municipal government. Northeast Daily called for further integration with the mass movement in its September 1st editorial and decided to conduct a review of communication work starting this month. More than ten newspapers including Victory News in West Manchuria, New Heilongjiang News, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region News, and Qiqihar News have also decided to learn from the spirit of self-criticism of the Jin-Sui Daily and conduct business inspections. Tonghua Liaodong Daily pointed out in its "September 1st" editorial that it should do a better job of military reporting in the future.

　　东北解放区新闻界
  　进行业务检查
    【新华社东北三日电】东北解放区四大文化重镇哈尔滨、齐齐哈尔、延吉、通化等地新闻界热烈纪念“九一”记者节。哈市一日下午召开大会，到有东北日报、哈尔滨公报、哈尔滨工农日报、午报、大华日报、哈尔滨日报、东北画报及本社东北总分社等代表一百五十余人。会议除讨论如何改进今后业务外，并改组市记者协会。该市民营历史最长的午报社社长赵展鹏在演讲时说：“今天办报和过去有基本的不同，去年我们为了想获利，采取老办法，以较大篇幅登载‘桃色新闻’，不料销路从每日一千份，跌至八百份，以后在记协帮助下赶快改变方针，报导市民的各种翻身生活。销路激增至四千份，这证明今天解放区人民的思想情绪和过去发生了很大的变化。”前任记协理事长关鸿翼盛赞民主政府大力扶助各民营报纸之成绩。今年四月间当各报社经费最困难时，工商日报、哈尔滨公报、午报等各得市政府贷款三十万（每元合蒋币十元）元。东北日报在九一社论中号召进一步与群众运动结合，并决定自本月起检查通讯工作。西满之胜利报、新黑龙江报、内蒙自治报、齐市新闻等十余家报社亦均决定学习晋绥日报的自我批评精神，进行业务检查。通化辽东日报在“九一”社论中指出今后要更好地作军事报导。
