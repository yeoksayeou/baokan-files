The Ji-Lu-Yu Federation of Literary and Art Circles Summarizes One Year of Work
Achievements Made in Improving Folk Art Work
    [Report from our newspaper in Ji-Lu-Yu, 6th] The Ji-Lu-Yu Federation of Literary and Art Circles has achieved great success in summarizing one year of work for the "September 1st" anniversary. Since its establishment last "September 1st," the Federation, under the leadership of the Propaganda Department of the District Party Committee, has consistently implemented the mass line and the policy of serving the people. Over the past year, it has revitalized cultural and artistic work in the border area. The Federation oversees four cultural and artistic organizations: the Literary and Art Work Troupe, the Minyou Opera Troupe, the Minyi Opera Troupe, and the Folk Art Department. Except for the Literary and Art Work Troupe, the others were old theatrical groups. After last "September 1st," they were successively placed under the leadership of the Federation. The Minyou Opera Troupe was originally an old opera troupe. Under the District Party Committee's principles of "leniency in economics, strictness in policy," and "enlightening consciousness and gradual improvement," it has undergone ideological transformation through denunciation of grievances over the past year. It has now changed its old theatrical troupe style, lives a simple and hard life, is united internally, and truly achieves learning from each other's strengths and compensating for each other's weaknesses. It has voluntarily stopped performing old feudal and superstitious dramas and has reformed some old dramas. At the same time, it has rehearsed famous historical dramas such as "Three Attacks on Zhu Village" and "Anti-Xuzhou," which have been warmly supported and welcomed by the masses. In terms of the transformation of folk artists, the first step was to start with the transformation of picture book stalls, leading to the unity of various old artists. Picture book stalls were elevated to progressive bookstores, such as changing "Top Scholar Passing the Imperial Examination" to "Patriotic Self-Defense," with the couplet "A hundred miles of victorious red flags, sons join the army with horses flying" added on both sides, so that old art could be combined with the current struggle. According to statistics, after the transformation of picture book stalls in 13 counties including Shou Zhang, Dongping, and Liaocheng, profits reached 600,000. On February 14th of this year, the Folk Art Department held another meeting, attended by more than 50 representatives of magic lantern show operators, sculptors, carvers, bookstores, and zither players from 13 counties including Liaocheng and Dong'e. Based on the basic spirit of Chairman Mao's policy on literature and art and the principles of the mass line, ideological education, and the trinity of public-private partnership, the meeting studied the guidelines for improving folk art, uniting and organizing more than 1,250 folk artists in 13 counties. Most of the picture book stalls were converted into progressive bookstores, and associations for the improvement of magic lantern shows, book and newspaper technology, sculpture technology, and New Year pictures were established. Training classes for old artists were also opened. Three sets of new magic lantern shows have been produced—The Life of Chiang Kai-shek, Eighteen Years of Heroic Struggle, and How to Raise a Baby—and new lyrics for ballads and storytelling have been compiled, combined with land reform review, the Yellow River problem, joining the army, and production for propaganda, directly combining with the current central work. Therefore, folk art has become the core and banner for folk artists to unite and make progress. In addition, the Literary and Art Work Troupe has shifted from performing large dramas to small dramas, and from stage dramas to plaza dramas. In terms of content, it focuses on being short, concise, and closely linked to the central work and the personal stories of the masses, advocating quick writing and quick performance, which is deeply welcomed by the broad masses.

　　冀鲁豫文联总结一年工作
  　提高民艺工作获成绩
    【本报冀鲁豫六日电】冀鲁豫文联“九一”周年纪念总结一年工作，获得很大的成就。文联自去年“九一”成立后，在区党委宣传部的领导下，始终贯澈群众路线为人民服务的方针，一年以来，使边区文化艺术工作焕然一新。文联辖有文艺工作团、民友剧社、民艺剧社、民间艺术部等四个文化艺术团体，除文工团外，其余皆为旧的戏剧团体。去年“九一”以后，始先后归文联领导，民友剧社原为一旧剧团，在区党委“经济上宽，政策上严”“启发自觉逐渐提高”的原则下，经过一年来的思想改造，进行诉苦，现已改变过去的戏班作风，生活朴素艰苦，内部团结，真正作到了取长补短，互相学习，自动停演封建迷信之旧剧，并将部分旧剧加以改造，同时并排演“三打祝家庄”“反徐州”等历史名剧，在广大群众中获得热烈拥护与欢迎。在民间艺人的改造方面，首先是由改造码子店着手，到团结各种旧艺人。将码子店提高成为进步书籍，如：“状元及第”改为“爱国自卫”两边加上“长胜大旗红十里，男儿从军马如飞”的对联，使旧的艺术与现实斗争相结合，计寿张、东平、聊城等十三县码子店经改造后，获利达六十万。今年二月十四日，民艺部又召开会议，到聊城、东阿等十三县的洋片剧工、塑工、雕刻、书店、洋琴等代表五十多人，根据毛主席文艺政策的基本精神及群众路线、思想教育、民办公助等三位一体的原则，研究了民间艺术的改进方针，团结和组织了十三个县的一千二百五十多个民间艺人。码子店大部改为进步书店，成立了洋片改进研究会、书报技术研究会、雕塑技术研究会及年画改进研究会，开办了旧艺人轮训班。新洋片已制成三套——蒋介石的一生、英勇奋斗十八年、怎样养娃娃，编印坠子及大鼓新词，结合土改复查、黄河问题、参军、生产进行宣传，直接结合了当前的中心工作。因而民艺都成了民间艺人团结进步的核心与旗帜。此外文艺工作团由演大剧到演小剧，由舞台剧发展到广场剧，内容上着重短小精悍，结合中心工作及群众亲身故事，提倡快编快演，深得广大群众的欢迎。
