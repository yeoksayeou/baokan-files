Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 2nd – Under the powerful political offensive of the military and civilians in the liberated areas, KMT soldiers are deserting in increasing numbers from the Tianjin-Baoding area and the strongholds along the Ping-Han Railway Line. In just over three months, more than 1,000 KMT-puppet soldiers from the Shijiazhuang area have fled to the liberated areas of Luancheng and Gaocheng. Luancheng County alone has won over 188 officers and soldiers of the KMT 6th Division (formerly the 3rd Army) and over 600 puppet soldiers and personnel who fled from Shijiazhuang. In the most recent half-month, another 300-plus soldiers from a battalion of the 32nd Division of the KMT army in Liangcun (southeast of Shijiazhuang) have fled. According to Duan Jusheng, a soldier who deserted from the Special Service Company of the 7th Brigade of that division, when the remnants of the puppet 5th Column (Hou Ruyong's unit) were first incorporated into the 19th Regiment of the brigade, there were more than 500 men, but now only about 200 remain. According to a January statistic, the division had more than 7,000 men, but now there are only about 4,000. In late July, when the KMT army raided Rongding (a newly established county between Rongcheng and Dingxing), the county accommodated over 100 deserters. In the effort to win over KMT-puppet soldiers, the masses in Luancheng, east of Shijiazhuang, launched a "life-saving movement" for KMT-puppet soldiers, putting forward the slogans "Save our sons and brothers, save our fellow villagers, save our friends." Joint symposiums were held for KMT-puppet soldiers who had fled and their families, and the KMT-puppet soldiers were organized to pour out their grievances. When the KMT-puppet families heard about the miserable conditions in the KMT-puppet army – beatings, starvation, injuries left unattended, and deaths unburied – they all burst into tears. At this time, the opportunity was seized to conduct a mass persuasion campaign among the KMT-puppet families, with men persuading men, women persuading women, and puppet families persuading puppet families, each finding ways to call back their own sons and brothers. In the persuasion, ideological concerns were addressed and specific difficulties were resolved based on the different targets. For example, those from poor and middle peasant backgrounds who returned were appropriately allocated fruits to help them settle down and make a living, enabling them to return to the right path and correct the various bad habits they had developed in the KMT-puppet army. Those who were willing to go and call back their sons and brothers were given travel expenses, and the KMT currency they brought with them was exchanged. At the same time, training classes for KMT-puppet families were held to educate them on the current situation and the government's lenient policies. "Reception stations for those who quit the civil war" have now been set up on the main roads and in market towns in the border areas.

　　晋察冀展开强大政治攻势
  　平汉线蒋伪络绎投诚
    【新华社晋察冀二日电】在解放区军民强大的政治攻势下，平津保地区及平汉线各据点蒋军逃亡日众。三个多月内，仅石家庄地区蒋伪士兵逃来栾城、藁城解放区者即达千余人。栾城一县即争取逃来之石庄蒋军六师（原三军）官兵达一百八十八人及伪军伪人员六百余人。最近半月该县良村（石庄东南）之蒋军三十二师一个营又逃来三百余人。据该师七旅特务连逃来之士兵段局生谈：伪五纵（侯如墉部）残部刚编入该旅十九团时为五百余人，现仅余二百余人。该师一月份统计为七千余人，现只剩四千人左右。七月下旬蒋军窜扰容定（容城定兴间新设县）时，经该县收容者即达百余人。在争取蒋伪士兵中石（庄）东栾城群众曾展开了对蒋伪士兵的“救命运动，提出‘救子弟、救乡亲、救朋友’”的口号，召开逃来蒋伪士兵与蒋伪属的联合座谈会，组织蒋伪士兵诉苦，当蒋伪属听到蒋伪军中挨打受饿，打伤无人管，打死无人埋的悲惨情况，无不失声恸哭。此时即抓紧时机，对蒋伪属进行群众性的劝说运动，男劝男，女劝女，伪属劝伪属，各自设法叫回自己的子弟。劝说中并根据不同对象解除其思想顾虑及解决其具体困难，如对来归之贫中农成份，适当分给果实，帮助安家立业，使他们能归入正途，改正在蒋伪军中养成的各种恶习，愿亲往叫子弟者发给路费，携来蒋币予以兑换等。同时举办蒋伪属训练班，进行时局及政府宽大政策的教育，边沿地区之要道与集镇，现均设立“退出内战招待站”。
