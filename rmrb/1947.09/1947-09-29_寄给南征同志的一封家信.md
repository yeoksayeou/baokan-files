    A Letter Home to Comrade Nanzheng
    Jingrong and all the southbound comrades!
    It feels like many years have passed since we parted over seventy days ago. I miss you all dearly!
    You probably thought I would have cried more than once, right? No, I haven't shed a tear. In fact, after you bit your lower lip and walked out the door with firm steps, I quickly calmed my somewhat disturbed mood and immediately felt an infinite hope from within! My anticipation for the arrival of victory news grows deeper day by day! After receiving your letter that you were about to cross the other side of the Yellow River, my hope became even more eager. I often unconsciously gazed south, and during breaks from my busy work, a detailed map of Central China became my special favorite.
    Finally, my fervent hope became reality. "People's Liberation Army Launches Nationwide Counter-Offensive," "Our Army's Might Shakes Both Sides of the Yangtze," "Liu Deng's Army Victoriously Enters Dabie Mountains"! Row after row of extra-large headlines caught my eye. The newspaper in my hand trembled slightly with the fluctuation of my heart. Oh, my glasses! Gradually covered with a layer of misty dampness—tears, tears of excitement, relief, and agitation!
    Looking at the newspaper, at the map, I carefully searched for your great march's route; I "seemed" to see you and countless dear comrades braving the rain of bullets from Chiang's bandit army in the sky, heroically and happily crossing the waves of the Yellow River, traversing railways, wading through rivers and canals, climbing mountain after mountain, passing through village after village, city after city. In this rainy season, you traversed the muddy fields of the South. You, heroic sons and daughters of the people, have experienced unimaginable hardships and won incredibly great victories! In the earth-shaking cheers of victory, I again "seemed" to see tens of thousands of liberated people, with tears of joy and gratitude like mine today, pouring out endless grievances to you—the people's loved ones—and raising their iron fists that frighten the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, advancing shoulder to shoulder with you!
    Ah! Rong, please don't blame me for adding the word "seemed" to the vivid reality you experienced. I regret that I couldn't witness this great and moving reality in person due to my poor health! However, because you—my Jingrong—are a member of this victorious counter-offensive march, I feel immense honor and comfort!
    I must emphatically tell you and all the dear comrades: such concern, eager admiration, and jubilation are not limited to your loved ones! Since you left, the organization has implemented streamlining and seriously investigated landlord ideology. Our spirits are heightened, our stance is firmer, and our vision is clearer. All comrades are happily shouldering doubled work tasks. Everyone's unanimous feeling is: we must not let down the comrades who went south, and family members are even encouraging themselves not to lag behind their loved ones. Even the villagers often ask about the news of the comrades "going to Henan." In short, although our geographical distance from you is getting farther day by day, our spirits are so closely connected!
    I believe that in deepening among the masses and mobilizing the masses, you must have created achievements as glorious as your battle results, and the training and progress you have gained must be leap-like and abundant! Please tell us more about your valuable experiences!
    Rong! I'm telling you: my health is gradually improving. Since you're not at home, the comrades in the organization are particularly concerned about me, and Shan Zhi has also received generous care, so please rest assured! Comrade Qiaolin's wife is already working, and the child is also very well. Comrade Bo Huaiqi's wife is recuperating and is plump. All your loved ones and children left in the rear are receiving affectionate care, so please don't worry! Our only hope is that the national counter-offensive will develop more rapidly, that you will achieve greater and more victories, so that the people in the vast areas can be liberated from the ravages of Chiang's bandits as soon as possible, and that we can reunite with you soon!
    After a considerable period of hard work, your bodies are probably thinner, but now that you have reached the land of fish and rice, with spiritual happiness and close care from the masses, you will surely strengthen your body as strongly as your revolutionary will. We—your loved ones—believe this, and therefore we are gratified!
    Thousands of words cannot fully express my feelings. In short, "work hard, take care of your health," this is what we should all encourage each other with!
      Wishing you peace!
        Ling, September 16th

    寄给南征同志的一封家信
    景荣暨南下的诸位友好们！
    我们分别已七十多天了，好象隔了许多年月似的，深深的怀念！
    你大概会以为我曾不止一次的垂泣吧？不，我没有落过泪，而且当你咬紧下唇以坚毅的脚步走出家门之后，我很快的平抑了有点紊乱的心境，随即从内心里涌现起无限的希望！我与日俱深的热切的企待着胜利消息的到来！在接到你们即将渡过黄河彼岸的来信后，我的希望愈加热切了，经常会不自觉的瞩望着南方，而在紧张工作之余，那一张华中详图竟成了我的特殊的爱好了。
    终于，热切的希望成了现实。“人民解放军开始全国性大反攻”，“我军威震长江南北”，“刘邓大军胜利进入大别山区”！一行又一行特大号字的标题映入眼帘，拿在手里的报纸随着我心的波动而微微颤抖，眼镜呵！渐渐的蒙上了一层迷雾的潮湿，是泪，兴奋的，欣慰的，而又激动的泪呵！
    看着报纸，对着地图，我仔细的寻索着你们大进军的行程；我“好象”看见了你和无数的亲爱的同志们，冒着蒋匪地上空中的弹雨，英勇愉快的渡过黄河的波涛，横越铁道，涉过一条条的河渠，爬上一座一座的山岭经过，一个村庄又一个村庄，一座城市又一座城市，在这多雨的季节，踏遍南方泥泞的田野，你们，英勇的人民子弟啊！经历了难于想象的艰险，也赢得无比伟大的胜利！在震撼山河的胜利欢呼中，我又“好象”看见了成千成万的被解放的人民，怀着和我今天一样的欢欣感激的泪，向你们——老百姓的亲人们，倾吐着无尽的苦水，举起使蒋家匪帮丧胆的铁拳，与你们并肩前进！
    啊！荣，请莫责备我，竟将你们所亲历的活生生的现实，加上了“好象”的字眼。我很遗憾，我竟因身体的不争气而未能亲见这伟大动人的现实！然而，因为有你——我的景荣，成为这胜利反攻的进军之一员，却使我感到莫大的光荣和安慰！
    应该着重的告诉你和所有的亲爱的同志们：这样的关望热切羡慕和欢腾，并非仅仅限于你们的爱人！自你们走后，机关实行了精简，同时认真的清查了地主思想，精神紧张了，立场更坚定了，眼光更明亮了，所有的同志们都愉快的肩负起加倍的工作任务，大家一致的心情是：不要对不起南下的同志们，而家属们更免励着不要落后于自己的爱人，甚至村里的老百姓也时常询问“下河南”的同志的消息。总之，我们与你们在地理上距离虽一天比一天远了，可是在精神上却是这样紧紧相连呵！
    相信你们在深入群众发动群众中，必然创造了与战绩一样辉煌的成绩，而你们每一个人所获得的锻炼与进步，必然是飞跃而丰富的！请多多将你们宝贵的经验告诉我们吧！
    荣！告诉你：我的身体日渐好转，你不在家，组织上同志们对我特别关心，善侄也得到优厚的照顾，请放心！乔林同志的爱人已在工作，小孩也很好，薄怀奇同志的爱人休养得胖胖的，所有留在后方的你们的爱人和小孩们都得亲切的爱护，请你们不要挂念！我们唯一的希望是全国反攻更迅速的开展，你们获得更大更多的胜利，让广大地区的人民从蒋匪蹂躏下即早解放，也让我们能早日前去和你们团聚！
    经过相当长期的辛劳，你们的身体大概消瘦了一些吧，但现在你们既已到达鱼米之乡，在精神愉快和群众密切的爱护之下，你一定将身体锻炼得和革命的意志一样的坚强，我们——你的爱人们，是这样的相信，也因此而快慰！
    千言万语，无法尽述，总之，“努力工作，保重身体”，这是我们大家应该共勉的！
      祝你们平安！
