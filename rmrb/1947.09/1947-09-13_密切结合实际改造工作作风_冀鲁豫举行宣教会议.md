　　Closely Integrate with Practical Work to Transform Work Style
  　Hebei-Shandong-Henan Holds Propaganda and Education Conference
    [Report from our Hebei-Shandong-Henan office on the 11th] In order to exchange experiences and further promote the improvement of propaganda and education work, the District Party Committee Propaganda Department specially convened a joint conference of propaganda and education workers in the entire district last month. Attendees included propaganda ministers from various prefectural and county party committees, heads of county communication stations, branch presidents of Xinhua News Agency, and all comrades from the Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Daily, totaling over a hundred people. After reviewing the gains of propaganda and education work over the past year, various regions have further clarified that propaganda and education work should be closely integrated with practical work. At the opening of the conference, Comrade Xu Yunbei, Minister of the Propaganda Department of the District Party Committee, delivered the opening speech. Then, Comrade Yuan Sheng, Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Fourth Prefectural Committee, who had just returned from a visit to Taihang, introduced the propaganda and education work of Beiliu Village in Licheng, Taihang. Afterwards, group discussions were held to exchange experiences and learn from each other, and many innovations were discovered. For example: the First, Third, and Fifth Sub-districts paid attention to cadre education and ideological leadership in the environment of guerrilla warfare; Heze created the valuable experience of continuing to publish newspapers while fighting guerrilla warfare in the environment of guerrilla warfare (Note: See page 2 of this newspaper on September 6th). The propaganda offensive of the Seventh Sub-district paved a good path for later political offensives. The communication work and ideological mobilization in Boping and Shouzhang, and the propaganda work in Fan County, have all created very good experiences. After the conference's typical reports, issues concerning newspapers and communication work, ideological mobilization, branch education, national education, and the development of folk art were raised. After group discussions, heated discussions were held at the conference. Finally, Comrade Xu Yunbei made a summary. He pointed out the situation and tasks of Hebei-Shandong-Henan, and the direction of future efforts in propaganda and education work. When talking about several issues in propaganda and education work, he said: "The propaganda work itself is practical work, and it must be closely integrated with practical work." When talking about ideological leadership and ideological mobilization in propaganda and education work, he summarized that the village cadre training class in Guancheng, the self-reporting of meritorious service in Boping, the offering of ideas in Shouzhang, and the persistence in guerrilla warfare in Henan, have all made achievements in ideological leadership. Finally, when pointing out the issue of the work style of propaganda and education workers, he said: Every propaganda and education worker should have a pragmatic work style, guard against arrogance and impetuosity, and resolutely guard against being flashy and impractical. They should bury themselves in hard work and closely integrate with the actual movement.
