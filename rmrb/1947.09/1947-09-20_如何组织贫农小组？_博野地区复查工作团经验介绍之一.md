    I. The Beginning of Poor Peasant Organizations
    How to mobilize poor peasants? In the Fucha demonstration in the Boye area, a bottom-up approach was adopted. The following three methods were used in each village: First, door-to-door communication. Extensive visits and informal discussions were conducted, targeting the actual situation of each person, to identify active poor peasant elements, and then develop them "like a gourd vine" from points to areas, to achieve universal and free group formation. The second is to adopt a combination of extensive communication and "direct sowing" and "multiple sowing" methods, conduct widespread publicity and encouragement, and call for organization for emancipation. After mutual communication, poor peasant organizations in various streets and alleys were quickly organized. The third is to have village cadres and various village organizations find the poorest Party member cadres and members to go deep down, first communicating with the active poor peasant elements and struggle backbones in last year's land reform movement, and then have them conduct extensive communication. The most basic method is for poor peasants to communicate with poor peasants, and for poor peasants to organize poor peasants. (The experience of the Zhuolu Area Work Team in Chahar Province believes that in order to smoothly mobilize poor peasants, cadres can be assigned three tasks, starting from the poor peasants, the branch, and the cadres: one goes deep into the masses to seek out active poor peasant elements and carry out in-depth enlightenment education; one mobilizes and educates the branch to fully support the poor peasants, using poor peasant Party members as backbones to unite the poor peasants; one educates the village cadres to serve the poor peasants, and launches a "face-washing" movement for those with problems, who can be absorbed into the new peasant association after being reformed.)
    How to enlighten and educate? (1) Typical grievance-airing, from individual to family, from family to neighbors. In the process of in-depth contact with poor and extremely poor peasants, the first step is to talk about personal experiences, life, and hardships, and discover various typical facts of suffering, using these to repeatedly encourage and educate, thus arousing more people to air their grievances. After individual informal talks and grievance-airing, the next step is to dig up the roots of poverty, eliminate various fatalistic ideas, and then discuss ways to emancipate themselves, and inspire the poor to organize themselves first. (2) Use the method of comparing and calculating to enlighten poor peasants to compare wealth and poverty, compare class status, and compare life. In the process of comparison and calculation, some villages of poor peasants themselves put forward specific slogans, such as landlords eat three meals a day, while the poor eat two meals of porridge, so the poor put forward: "Struggle for one more meal." In this way, from near to far, from now to the past, from one's own family to other families, the enlightenment and education are most in-depth. (3) Focus on the most pressing issues of poor peasants. An old woman living in a temple in Yangquan had no house, no land, and had not harvested any grain from the three mu of land she had been allocated last year. An active poor peasant asked her: Why do you live in the ancestral hall? This immediately woke her up. After airing her grievances, she became active and joined the poor peasant group. (4) Conduct education on "who supports whom" and "who is the master," and repeatedly explain that "all power belongs to the peasant association" and "the poor must control the power in the village," which is most easily accepted by poor peasants. Different cadres select different targets. Military cadres go deep into poor families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, and women cadres go deep into poor women. The method of education should be that the masses speak first and we listen, then move to mutual informal talks and discussion and research, avoiding boring lectures and uniformity. (5) Finally, you must carefully listen to the opinions of poor peasants and seize the key to dispel their concerns. For example, the biggest concerns in the opinions of poor peasants are: First, they are afraid that the higher authorities will not do a thorough job again, leaving it half-done and then leaving. Therefore, each village reviewed the reasons for the lack of thoroughness in the past to the masses, stating that this time "we must get to the bottom of it." Second, they are afraid that the distribution of fruits will be unfair, that village cadres will get more fruits, or that individuals will favor the landlords. Therefore, on the one hand, the leadership educated the cadres who got more fruits, and on the other hand, boldly let the masses criticize them, and the cadres washed their faces, returned the extra fruits, and handed them over to the peasants for redistribution, which increased the confidence of the emancipated peasants.
    II. Consolidation of Poor Peasant Groups
    Poor peasant groups were quickly established from points to areas through the communication of active poor peasant elements. Some, due to not having checked their class status in time, resulted in not only some middle peasants mixing in after the organization expanded, but even individual traitors, spies, and children of the households being struggled against mixing in. Therefore, it is necessary to consolidate and continue to expand and develop. The rectification work of the poor peasant groups in the six demonstration villages was done by the poor peasants themselves. Regarding the method of consolidation, the masses adopted methods such as individual review, group review, review between groups, mutual review between streets, or collective review by representatives of each group. In the review, everything was done through the poor peasant masses. After the poor peasant group is initially organized, anyone who wants to join the group must be discussed and approved by everyone. For the middle peasants who came in when organizing the poor peasant group, they should be organized into a separate middle peasant group and adopt a method of unity. The feudal remnants, stubborn pseudo-forces, and liquidated elements who protect the interests of the landlords should be isolated, not allowed to participate in the poor peasant group, and those who have mixed in should be cleaned out; but for some lazy wives, lazy men, hooligans, prostitutes, thieves, superstitious elements, and poor peasants who have been petty thieves, a method of unity and education should be adopted. But the most important thing in consolidating the poor peasant group is ideological consolidation. That is, only in the universal grievance-airing movement can the poor peasant group be further consolidated.
    III. Organizational Forms of Poor Peasant Groups
    According to the experience of the six villages, the organizational forms of the poor peasant groups are as follows: First, the poor peasant group has a fixed organization. The poor peasants and farm laborers in the whole village are first organized to freely form groups. Generally, poor peasants are eager to organize in this way, and hope to maintain and consolidate it for a long time. The advantage is that it is convenient to concentrate the opinions and demands of the poor peasant class, and it is convenient to discuss issues. Second, when the poor peasant group widely unites with the middle peasants, the poor and middle peasants are organized together (establishing a new peasant association); but the meetings and organization of the poor peasant group are still maintained. The advantage is that it is convenient for the poor and middle peasants to exchange opinions, and the opinions of the poor peasants can be approved by the middle peasants in a timely manner. Third, the poor peasant group has a separate organization. But when mobilizing and uniting with the middle peasants, the poor peasants actively help the middle peasants to communicate and organize. Some are elected as group leaders or representatives of the middle peasant group, which is also convenient for uniting the middle peasants. But in any case, it is necessary to maintain the superiority, status, and backbone role of the poor peasants in the peasant leading organs, so as to realize the leadership of the poor peasant class and implement the poor peasant line. After the poor peasant group is organized, it should democratically elect representatives, and each village elects seven to thirteen people (including women representatives) to form a poor peasant representative conference in each village. This representative conference is the highest leadership and power organ of the peasants themselves in the movement. There are two ways to elect representatives of the poor peasant group: one is to let go and let the poor peasant congress directly elect without restraint, and the other is indirect election by the group electing representatives. Experience has proved that when the poor peasants come together, they first demand real democracy, and the eyes of the masses are bright. All those directly elected by the masses have found their own reputable agents, while those indirectly elected have taken detours. After the representative conference is formed, the masses themselves elect the chairman, vice-chairman, secretary, armed forces, custodian, registration, review, and other committee members, and the peasant representative conference takes office and holds an oath ceremony. After the representative conference is formed, it should be allowed to work freely. The role of the poor peasant and farm laborer group representative conference in the movement is manifested in: First, the poor peasants have their own organ to lead the struggle, making the poor peasant group a more conscious organization of their own; Second, the peasants are given the highest power, and the two slogans "all power belongs to the representative conference" and "everything obeys the opinions of the peasants" are put forward to overcome the practice of cadres or newly elected representatives monopolizing everything; Third, it is convenient to collect the opinions of the peasants, and after research, unify and concentrate them, and then disseminate and implement them. The peasant representative conference is the predecessor of the peasant association, and a formal peasant association is elected after the mass struggle. The peasants reflect: "This is the best way to do it. In a struggle, who is a hero and who is dung beetle will be seen."

　　如何组织贫农小组？
  　博野地区复查工作团经验介绍之一
    兹将晋察冀博野地区复查工作团组织贫农小组的经验综合介绍如下，以供各地参考。　　　　　　　　　
　　　　　　　　——本报资料室
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    一、贫农组织的开始
    如何发动贫农？博野地区在复查示范中，采用了自下而上的方法。各村进行时，有如下三种办法：第一是挨户串通。针对每个人的实际情况，广泛进行访问漫谈，从中发现贫农积极分子，再经过他们“葫芦串蔓”，由点到面的发展，以达到普遍自由的结组。第二是采取广泛串通与“直撒种”和“多撒种”的办法，普遍进行宣传鼓励，号召为翻身组织起来。经过相互串通后，各街各巷的贫农组织，便很快组织起来。第三是经过村干部和村各种组织，找最贫苦的党员干部会员向下深入，首先串通去年土改运动中的贫农积极分子和斗争骨干，经过他们去进行广泛串通。其中最基本的办法，是由贫农串通贫农，贫农组织贫农（察南涿鹿地区工作团的经验认为：为了顺利的发动贫农，干部力量可配备三股，从贫农、支部、干部三方面下手：一股深入群众，寻求贫农积极分子，深入进行启发教育；一在支部中动员教育，全力支持贫农，以贫农党员作骨干，联合贫农；一在村干中进行教育，使其为贫农服务，对有毛病者展开洗脸运动，一经改造，即可吸收参加新农会。）
    如何启发教育？（１）典型诉苦，由个别到一家，由一家到四邻。在深入接触贫农赤贫过程中，首先是谈身世谈生活，谈苦处，从中发现各种典型的苦难事实，以此反复进行鼓励教育，于是便引起了更多群众的诉苦。个别漫谈诉苦后，紧接着就是挖穷根，从中清除各种听天由命的思想，然后就商量翻身办法，启示贫苦群众首先组织起来。（２）用比一比，算一算的办法，启发贫农比穷富，比成份，比生活。在比算当中，有的村贫农自己就提出了具体口号，如地主净吃三顿饭，穷人却吃两顿稀，于是穷人们便提出：“为多吃一顿饭而斗争。”这样从近到远，从现在到过去，从自家到别家，启发教育最为深入。（３）抓紧贫苦农民最迫切的问题入手。杨圈一个住庙老太太，房无一间，地无一垅，去年分到三亩地尚未打粮食，贫农积极分子问她：为啥住在祠堂里？一下点醒了她，经过诉苦后她积极起来，参加贫农组。（４）进行“谁养活谁”“谁是主人”的教育，反复解释“一切权力归农会”，“穷人要掌握村中大权”，贫农最易接受。不同干部选取不同对象。部队干部深入贫苦抗属，妇女干部深入贫苦妇女。教育方式应先由群众讲我们听，到互相漫谈，和讨论研究，切忌闷头子死讲和千篇一律。（５）最后必须细心倾听贫农意见，抓紧关节解脱其顾虑。如贫农意见中最大的顾虑：第一怕上级再做不彻底，弄个半生熟又走了。于是各村都向群众检讨了过去不彻底的原因，表明这次“一定要一竿子扎到底。”第二怕果实分配不公，怕村干多得果实或个别的袒护地主。因此领导上一面教育多得果实的干部，一面大胆的让群众向其批评，干部进行洗脸，退出多得果实，交由农民重新分配，翻身农民信心随之增强。
    二、贫农小组的巩固
    贫农小组由贫农积极分子串通，很快由点到面的建立起来。有些由于未及时查清成份，结果组织扩大以后，不仅有些中农混入，甚至也有个别的汉奸特务及被斗户的子女混入，于是必须进行巩固与继续扩大发展。六个示范村的贫农小组整顿工作，是由贫农自己来作的。关于巩固的方法，群众采取了个别审查，小组审查，组与组审查，各街互相审查，或由各小组代表集体审查等办法。在审查中，一切通过贫农群众。贫农小组初步组织起来后，谁要入组必须经过大家讨论通过，对于组织贫农小组时进来的中农，则另编中农小组，采取团结办法。对庇护地主利益的封建尾巴顽伪势力及被清算的分子，是孤立他们，不允许他们参加贫农小组，已混入的之清洗出去；而对一些懒婆、懒汉、流氓、破鞋、贼棍、迷信分子及当过小偷的贫苦农民，则应采取团结教育办法。但巩固贫农小组最重要的，还是思想上的巩固。这就是要在普遍的诉苦运动中，才能使贫农小组达到更加巩固。
    三、贫农小组的组织形式
    根据六个村的经验，贫农小组的组织形式，有如下三种：第一、贫农小组有固定的组织，全村贫雇农首先组织起来，自由结成小组。一般贫农都迫切要求这样组织，并希望长期保持巩固下去，其好处是便于集中贫农阶层的意见和要求一致，讨论问题方便。第二、贫农小组在广泛团结中农时，贫农中农即混合组织（成立新农会）；但仍保持贫农小组的会议和组织，其好处是便于贫中农交换意见，和贫农意见能及时取得中农的赞同。第三、贫农小组有单独组织。但在发动团结中农时，贫农积极帮助中农串通组织，有些当选为中农组的小组长，或代表，这样也便于团结中农。但不论怎样，切必须保持贫农在农民领导机关中的优势，地位和骨干作用，以实现贫农阶层的领导权，使贫农路线得到贯澈。贫农小组组织起来后，即应民主选出代表，各村选举七人至十三人（包括妇女代表在内）组成各村贫农代表会。这种代表会，就是运动中农民自己的最高领导和权利机关。贫农小组代表的选举，有两种办法：一是放手的毫无拘束的由贫农大会直接选举，一是由小组选出代表的间接选举。经验证明：贫农一起来，首先要求真正民主，群众的眼光是明亮的，凡经直接选举的，群众都找到了自己有威信的代理人，凡间接选举的，却走了弯路。代表会产生后，由群众自己选出正、副主席、秘书、武装、保管、登记、审查等委员，农民代表会就职时并举行宣誓。代表会产生后，应放手让他们工作。贫雇农小组代表会在运动中的作用表现了：第一、贫农有了自己领导斗争的机关，使贫农小组更成为他们自己的自觉组织；第二、农民赋予了最高权力，提出了“一切权力归代表会”，“一切服从农民意见”两个口号，以克服干部或新当选的代表包办代替；第三、便于汇集农民意见，经过研究，统一集中起来，又分散贯澈下去。农民代表会，就是农会的前身，经过群众斗争再选举正式农会。农民们反映：“这样做顶好，一斗争，谁是英雄，谁是粪蚵，就看出来了”。
