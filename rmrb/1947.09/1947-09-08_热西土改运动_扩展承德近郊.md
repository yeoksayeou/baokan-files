Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 5th. Ji-Re-Cha News: In the newly recovered areas of the western Rehe counties of Pingquan, Fengning, and Dage (newly established county), peasants have fiercely launched movements to seize treacherous bullies, strike down Baojia systems, and oppose counter-settlements, carrying out land reform. The movement has now progressed to the outskirts of Chengde. Peasants everywhere are seizing and settling accounts with treacherous bullies and landlords who engage in counter-settlements. In Dage's town, peasants paraded "counter-settlement" landlords carrying gold, silver, and treasures, shouting, "Return the blood you drank from us with blood, repay the lives you owe us with lives." Peasants in the eighth district of the county formed revenge squads and peasant liberation armies, establishing joint defense, searching and arresting village by village. As soon as bad elements were discovered, a gong would be sounded as a signal to summon the masses to provide support. Peasants in Fengning's Hedong village and other villages have formed revenge squads. Many of the major treacherous bullies and landlords who fled have been captured. In twenty-two villages on the western edge of Pingquan, after holding a revenge meeting of seven thousand peasants in Hushiha, Song Changrui, an old cowherd from Dazi Baiqi, returned to his village and led all the peasants in the village, carrying sacks, ropes, and wooden sticks, and rushed to the landlord's home to settle accounts. Large surrounding areas have been widely mobilized. Young peasants in villages along the Ping-Re Road have taken up weapons to defend their liberation. According to statistics from thirteen villages including Hedong in Fengning, peasants have recovered approximately ten thousand mu of land. In Dage's town, fifteen hundred peasant households have also preliminarily recovered more than three thousand mu of land.

Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, 6th. Poor masses in areas of Jin-Sui where land reform has not yet been implemented are confiscating surplus grain privately hoarded by landlords to be used as public grain for disaster relief. Just as the military and civilians throughout the region are practicing strict frugality and striving to "fight to prevent people from starving to death or starving less," landlords would rather waste and allow grain to rot than provide grain to farmers. For example, the landlord Han Siwei in Fangshan acted contrary to his usual stinginess, eating and drinking lavishly every day, which aroused the indignation of the masses. Everyone took it upon themselves to organize a management committee and store the landlord's grain for disaster relief. The landlord Zhao Shirong in Hequ repeatedly made excuses to refuse the masses' request for grain. The masses took action and searched, discovering several shi of rotten millet, yellow millet, and naked oats, and digging up more than a thousand jin of good grain. When the rotten grain was publicly displayed at a mass meeting, the poor peasants, seeing their own blood and sweat being squandered by the landlords in this way, gnashed their teeth with hatred.

　　热西土改运动
  　扩展承德近郊
    【新华社晋察冀五日电】冀热察讯：热河西部平川、丰宁、大阁（新设县）等县新收复区农民猛烈掀起捉奸霸、打保甲及反倒算运动，进行土地改革，刻运动已进展至承德近郊。农民到处捉拿及清算倒算的奸霸、地主，大阁城关农民押着“倒算”地主抬着金银财宝游行，高喊：“喝了咱们血的还血，欠下咱们命的还命。”该县八区农民并组成翻身复仇队、农民翻身军，成立联防，村村搜捕捉拿，发现坏蛋即鸣锣为号，召集群众赶往支援。丰宁河东等村农民均组有复仇队，大奸霸、地主潜逃者多被捕回。在平西部边缘二十二村在虎什哈举行七千农民的复仇大会后，达子白旗放牛老汉宋长瑞回村带领全村农民，背着口袋，带着绳子木棒，冲到地主家里进行清算。周围大片地区普遍发动起来，平热路两侧村庄青年农民则纷纷拿起武器保卫翻身。据丰宁河东等十三村统计，农民已收回土地约万亩，大阁城关一千五百户农民，亦初步收回土地三千余亩。
    【新华社晋绥六日电】晋绥尚未实行土地改革地区的贫苦群众，没收地主私藏的多余粮食，充作备荒救灾的义粮。正当全区军民厉行节衣缩食，努力“为不饿死人少饿死人而斗争”，地主宁愿浪费及任粮食腐烂，却拒绝向农民调剂粮食。如方山地主韩四维一反往日的吝啬，天天大吃大喝，当激起了群众愤慨，大家作主组织保管委员会，将地主存粮储存备荒。河曲地主赵世荣多次借故搪塞，拒绝群众调剂口粮，群众动手搜查结果，发现好几石沤烂了的小米、黄米和莜麦，另外刨出一千多斤好粮食。当沤烂的粮食在群众大会上公开览展时，贫农看着自己的血汗竟被地主如此糟踏，无不咬牙切齿。
