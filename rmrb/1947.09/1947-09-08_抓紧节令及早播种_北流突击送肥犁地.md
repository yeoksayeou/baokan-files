　　Seize the Season and Sow Early
　　Beiliu Rushes to Deliver Fertilizer and Plow Land
　　[Our newspaper, Licheng News] After the intense weeding campaign ended, some cadres and the masses developed a relaxed attitude, wanting to rest a bit. However, the End of Heat has passed, and White Dew is approaching, and the autumn sowing work is already upon us. Currently, there are still 650 mu of wheat land that have not been plowed once, and most of the fertilizer has not yet been transported to the fields. It is necessary to use all our strength to carry out a crash program of sowing preparations, in order to strive to start sowing wheat before White Dew. The leadership took advantage of the rainy weather to convene an enlarged meeting of the village production committee, absorbing all committee members and team members to participate, and studied how to carry out a crash program of autumn sowing work, in order to overcome the passive and lax thinking. Liu Bingwu proposed: "Plow the autumn stubble for wheat as early as possible. The season and climate are unforgiving, and we can't wait any longer." Then everyone discussed and deliberated, and unanimously recognized that if we wait until after White Dew in July, we will be late, and if we wait until White Dew in August, we will be ahead. This year is an intercalary year, which is actually the same as the solar term in August in previous years, and it is also a year of disaster. We urgently need to expand the wheat fields and increase grain production. Now that the rain is heavy and the ridges are large, we are afraid of early freezing in the autumn, and coupled with the support for labor and participation in the war, we must immediately calculate accurately, organize all labor and animal power, and rush to plow the land, repair the edges, and transport fertilizer, preparing to sow early. All other work should be completed in conjunction with sowing wheat as the center. After everyone clarified the center, they first made accurate calculations. The village has 650 mu of wheat land that has not been plowed twice, with 21 cattle plows and 29 mules and donkeys. Each plow averages 2 mu of land per day, which takes 6 days. To transport all the materials to the fields takes 4 days. There are 166 full male laborers and 73 male semi-laborers, all participating in the labor. In addition to plowing, transporting fertilizer, and repairing the land, we can also draw labor to carry fertilizer to nearby fields, plow small plots of wheat land, and finish the work of pulling seedlings and weeding late-maturing crops. We can also mobilize women and children to assist in the labor, which can draw more male labor to engage in sowing preparation work. In this way, we strive to plow the wheat land twice in 10 days, transport all the fertilizer, and sow all 310 mu of 169 wheat before the White Dew festival. Within 10 days after White Dew, sow all 824 mu of wheat. Each mu of land also needs an average of 30 @ of fertilizer. The above plan was immediately mobilized among the men and women in the village, and the groups discussed and formulated specific plans. Everyone clarified that the current center is sowing, and unanimously decided to carry out a crash program of ten days to complete the wheat sowing preparation work. In order to complete this work ahead of schedule, the following nine methods of appropriate use of labor and animal power, fertilizer application, living arrangements, and specific division of labor are implemented: (1) Within 10 days, we must get up when the bell rings, start early and work late, eat breakfast in the fields, and avoid holding village-wide mass meetings as much as possible. Other work is carried out in mutual aid groups. Take advantage of the evening and morning time for men to carry fertilizer to nearby fields, in order to save animal power. For example, the Huo Che Brigade originally planned to complete it in 7 days, but it can be completed in 5 days in this way. (2) Old cows plow the land and donkeys carry fertilizer, and one person drives three animals to continuously deliver fertilizer. Women combine new flower tubes to load fertilizer and carry @, so that 50 animals can transport fertilizer, and only 40 laborers are needed to deliver fertilizer. This can save 60 laborers compared to the past, where two laborers replaced each other to drive an animal to carry fertilizer. (3) Use stubble fertilizer, pen manure, and sheep manure on nearby land, and use oil cake and sheep manure mixed with manure on distant land, in order to shorten the animal's fertilizer transportation time. (4) The elderly repair the edges of the fields, weed late seedlings, and older children drive animals to deliver fertilizer. Women send meals to the fields in the morning, and are responsible for repairing cotton in conjunction with textile work during the day, and help pull seedlings and weed. When sowing wheat, they roll oil cake, roll wheat seeds, and lead animals, drawing more male labor to do heavy work. For example, the Hu Tian group originally planned to complete it in 13 days, but by organizing and working in this way, it can be completed in 9 days. The slogan put forward is: "One woman can't do it, but two wives are equal to a man." (5) Mutual assistance and labor exchange between groups and teams to ensure that the whole village can complete the work on time together. (6) The front is first and the rear is last, ensuring that military dependents of martyrs, retired soldiers, and militiamen participating in the war can sow wheat on time. Finally, the Huo Che Brigade challenged the Hong Fei Xing team, and everyone entered a tense plowing, fertilizing, and sowing campaign under the slogan of "Plowing the autumn stubble for wheat as early as possible, and increasing grain production by sowing wheat early."

　　抓紧节令及早播种
  　北流突击送肥犁地
    【本报黎城讯】紧张的锄苗运动结束后，部分干部群众产生了想歇一歇的松懈思想，但处暑已过，白露将到，秋季播种工作已摆在面前。目前尚有六百五十亩麦地未耕一犁，大部肥料尚未运往地里，正需用全力突击播种准备工作，以争取在白露前开始种麦。领导上即趁天雨机会，召开全村生产委员会扩大会议，吸收各委员队员参加，研究如何突击秋季播种工作，以克服消极松懈思想。刘丙午提出：“早点直麦秋垡茬，节令气候不由人，咱们不能再等待。”接着大家酝酿讨论，一致认识了七月白露往后赶，八月白露往前赶，今年是个闰月年，实际上已和往年八月交节一样，又是个灾荒年，急需扩大麦田，增产粮食。现在雨涝垧大，秋天怕早冻地，再加上支差参战，就必须立即精确计算，组织所有劳畜力，突击犁地、修边、运肥，准备提前播种，其他一切工作都应该以种麦为中心结合完成。大家明确中心后，首先做了精确计算，全村未耕二犁的正茬麦地六百五十亩，有牛二十一犋，骡驴二十九犋，每天每犋平均犁二亩地，需六天时间；反全部材料运到地里，需四天时间。有男全劳力一百六十六个，男半劳力七十三个，全部参加劳动，除犁地、运肥、修地外，还能抽出劳力往近地担肥，刨零碎的小块麦地，和了结晚种作物的拔苗锄草工作。还能动员妇女儿童辅助劳力参加，则可抽出更多的男劳力从事播种准备工作。这样争取在十天内耕完二犁麦地，运完肥，白露节前把三百一十亩一六九小麦全部种上。交白露后十天内把八百二十四亩正茬麦全部下种。每亩地还需平均上肥三十＠。以上计划当即在全村男女群众中动员，以组讨论订具体计划，大家明确了目前中心是播种后，一致决定要突击十天完成种麦准备工作。为使这一工作提前完成，并实行以下九种适当使用劳畜力施肥生活安排，和具体分工办法：（一）十天内要打钟起床，起早搭黑，在地里吃早饭，尽可能不开全村群众大会，其他工作在互助组结合进行。利用晚上和早晨时间，男人把近地担肥，以节省畜力，如火车大队原计划七天完成，这样五天即可完成。（二）老牛耕地驴搬肥，一人赶三头牲口，一直送肥，妇女结合新花管装肥抬＠，这样五十犋牲口运肥，只用四十个劳力送肥就行，比上过去两个劳力替换赶一犋牲口搬肥，即能节省劳力六十个。（三）近地上圪渣肥、圈肥、羊肥，远地上油饼和羊肥再和上圊肥，以缩短牲口运肥时间。（四）老年人修边堰，锄晚苗，大儿童赶牲口送肥，妇女早晨往地里送饭，白天结合纺织负责修理棉花，和帮助拔苗除草，种麦时溜油饼、溜麦籽、牵牲口，抽出更多的男劳力做重活。如虎田组原计划十三天完成，这样组织干起来，九天就能完成，提出的口号是：“一个妇女不能干，两个老婆顶个汉”。（五）组与组，队与队互助变工，保证全村能按时一齐完成。（六）先前方后后方，保证军烈干属荣退军人参战民兵能按时种上麦。最后火车大队向红飞星队提出挑战，大家在“早蚕直麦秋垡茬，赶早种麦增产粮食”的口号下，进入紧张的犁地运肥播种运动。（履端、培义）
