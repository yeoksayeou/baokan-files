Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 29th: Canberra News: The British Commonwealth conference discussing the Japanese peace treaty issue opened in Canberra on the 26th. Participating countries include the UK, Australia, Canada, India, Pakistan, South Africa, and New Zealand, with over 70 representatives in attendance. On the 25th, British Chief Delegate Addison stated during a reception for journalists that the UK would protect its interests in the Pacific. Addison supported Australia's proposal for "long-term control of Japan." According to a report from the Associated Press, the first meeting on the 26th unanimously approved and accepted the US proposal to adopt a two-thirds majority voting system when drafting the Japanese peace treaty. According to a report from Agence France-Presse on the 27th, the UK reminded members of the British Commonwealth to give due support to the legitimate demands of the Soviet Union in the Pacific region during the final discussion of the Japanese peace treaty to ensure the security of the region.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st: Canberra News: The British Commonwealth preparatory meeting for the Japanese peace treaty unanimously agreed on the 28th to demand complete disarmament of Japan and elimination of Japanese militarism to ensure the security of the Pacific and the interests of each country in the region. The resolution stipulates that Japan is not allowed to continue engaging in atomic energy research or development of atomic energy use, prohibits the construction of naval captains, restricts Japanese commercial shipping to inter-island trade, and completely prohibits Japan from manufacturing aircraft. The meeting paid close attention to and considered the principles of political clauses to be included in the Japanese peace treaty, such as guaranteeing basic human rights and continuing to exclude reactionaries and militarists from government positions. The meeting also suggested that Japan should abandon all overseas rights, which should be taken over by the respective countries.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 23rd: Sydney News: Kant Hughes, a member of the Victorian State Parliament in Australia, recently criticized US-Japan policy in Melbourne, stating that the United States wants to turn Japan into its 49th state. If this is the case, the British Commonwealth must withdraw because Britain will lose its prestige in Japan and bear huge expenses.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd: London News: The British Labour Party's newspaper, the "Daily Herald," argued in an article on August 27th commenting on the Japanese peace treaty issue, stating: "It would be unwise to exclude the Soviet Union from participating in the Japanese peace treaty." Regarding the attitude to be adopted towards the Japanese peace treaty, the newspaper believes: "The United States will take a lenient approach, Britain will advocate a neutral approach, and Australia will take a strict approach." The newspaper pointed out that Britain and its dominions should unanimously agree that after the treaty is investigated, the Allies must continue to control Japan. Regarding the maintenance of law and order, the United States will allow Japan to organize "very strictly limited" armed forces. Australia will oppose this, while the British opinion is only to allow Japan to expand its police force. Regarding the issue of Pacific security, Britain believes that the most important thing is to ensure that Japan does not become a tool of any ally. Regarding trade issues, Britain may demand that Japan's door be fully open. Regarding Japan's participation in the United Nations, the British unanimously believe that Japan is not qualified to join the United Nations during the Allied control period but is allowed to be listed as a sponsoring member or participate in some auxiliary organizations related to the United Nations.
