　　Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, September 17th: Xu Fanting, Director of the Jin-Sui Border Region Administrative Office, unfortunately passed away in Lin County at 11:00 PM on the 12th of this month. When the sad news arrived, the people of the border region mourned together. The Administrative Office has instructed all parts of the border region to fly flags at half-mast for three days and suspend entertainment for one week to express condolences. People from all walks of life in the border region have established a funeral committee, and nominated He Long, Lin Boqu, Xi Zhongxun, Wu Yuzhang, Xie Juezai, Wang Weizhou, Deng Jie, Ma Mingfang, Chen Jin＠, Zhao Shoushan, Li Dingming, Li Jingquan, Wu Xinyu, and twenty-one others as members of the funeral committee.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, September 17th: After receiving the application from Mr. Xu Fanting on his deathbed requesting to join the Party, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China immediately replied to Comrade Fanting's family, accepting Comrade Fanting's request and posthumously recognizing him as a full member of the CCP. Condolences were also sent for the death of Comrade Xu Fanting, the telegram is as follows: "To the Jin-Sui Border Region Administrative Office, the Jin-Sui Branch of the CPC Central Committee, the Jin-Sui Military Region Command, and please forward to Comrade Fanting's family: We were shocked and deeply saddened to hear the news of Comrade Fanting's death. Comrade Fanting joined the Tongmenghui in his early years and dedicated himself to the revolutionary cause of national democracy with unwavering determination. During the Anti-Japanese War, he led the Shanxi New Army and fought for the persistence of the Anti-Japanese War and the democratization of Shanxi. His contributions to the country are significant. Comrade Fanting, in his dying words, requested to join the Communist Party of China. His revolutionary loyalty is deeply moving. Our Party has decided to accept Comrade Fanting's request and posthumously recognize him as a full member of the Communist Party of China. We regard this as an honor for our Party. We hope that all comrades from the Party, government, military, and people of the Jin-Sui Border Region will work together to inherit Comrade Fanting's legacy, unite and advance with the people of Jin-Sui, develop and consolidate the Jin-Sui Liberated Area, and strive for the complete victory of the patriotic self-defense war. We also hope that Comrade Fanting's family will restrain their grief."
　　Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, September 17th: Mr. Xu Fanting, Director of the Jin-Sui Border Region Administrative Office and a revolutionary pioneer of the Tongmenghui era, wrote to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on his deathbed requesting to join the Party. The original letter is as follows: "Respected Chairman Mao and the Central Committee of the Communist Party: Since the Xinhai Revolution, Fanting has been bravely advancing in search of the truth for national and people's liberation. After several twists and turns, he finally realized that only the revolutionary road led by the Chinese Communist Party is the road to the complete liberation of the Chinese people. After the 'July 7th' Incident, he gladly accepted leadership and participated in the Anti-Japanese War and construction work in the Jin-Sui Anti-Japanese Democratic Base Area, hoping to better serve the people from then on, in order to fulfill his lifelong wish. Unexpectedly, Fanting fell seriously ill and had to go to Yan'an for recuperation. During those years in Yan'an, he was cared for in every possible way by the Party. What was especially gratifying was that he was able to often listen to the teachings of Chairman Mao and the Central Committee of the Communist Party. Fanting has struggled all his life, and only today has he witnessed the genuine emancipation of the broad masses of people in the liberated areas and truly seen the bright future of the new China. Every time, he cannot help but feel excited, and tears well up in his eyes. He has repeatedly wanted to request to join the Party and become a vanguard soldier in the revolutionary army to spend the rest of his years. However, due to being bedridden for a long time, he has not been able to make the request. Now, Fanting is terminally ill and fears that he will not be able to personally witness the traitors of the Chiang Kai-shek clique being brought to justice, the American imperialists rolling back to their country, and the complete liberation of the entire Chinese people. This is regrettable! Fanting is ashamed that he has made no contribution in recent years, but his determination to pursue the truth has never slackened for a single day. At this moment of impending death, I sincerely and respectfully request to join the Party. Please have the Central Committee of the Communist Party strictly examine my life history to see if it is qualified. If you agree to posthumously admit me to the Party, it would be my greatest wish in life. I hereby extend my Bolshevik greetings! Xu Fanting, September 11th."

    【新华社晋绥十七日电】晋绥边区行政公署主任续范亭，不幸于本月十二日下午十一时病逝临县，噩耗传来，边区人民同声悲悼。行署已指示边区各地悬半旗三天、停止娱乐一周致哀。边区各界并成立治丧委员会，推定贺龙、林伯渠、习仲勋、吴玉章、谢觉哉、王维舟、邓洁、马明芳、陈谨＠、赵寿山、李鼎铭、李井泉、武新宇等二十一人为治丧委员。
    【新华社晋绥十七日电】中共中央委员会接到续范亭先生于弥留之际请求入党之申请书后，立即复范亭同志家属，接受范亭同志要求，追认为中共正式党员。并对续范亭同志逝世致哀，电文如下：“晋绥边区行政公署、中共中央晋绥分局、晋绥军区司令部，并请转范亭同志家属：接电惊悉范亭同志病故噩耗，至深哀悼。范亭同志于早岁参加同盟会，即献身于民族民主的革命事业，百折不挠；在抗日民族战争期间领导山西新军，为坚持山西抗战与山西民主化而奋斗，功在国家，范亭同志在弥留之际遗言，要求加入中国共产党，其革命忠忱，使人感动。本党决定接受范亭同志的要求，追认为中国共产党正式党员，并以此引为本党的光荣，望我晋绥边区党政军民各方同志一致努力，继承范亭同志遗志，与晋绥人民团结前进，发展与巩固晋绥解放区，争取爱国自卫战争的彻底胜利，并望范亭同志家属节哀。”
    【新华社晋绥十七日电】晋绥边区行政公署主任、同盟会时代革命先进续范亭先生于弥留之际，致书中共中央请求入党，原函如下：敬爱的毛主席和中共中央：范亭自辛亥以来，即摸索为民族和人民解放的真理奋勇前行，在几经波折之后，终于认清了只有中国共产党所领导的革命道路，才是中国人民彻底解放的道路。“七七”抗战之后，即欣然接受领导，参加晋西北抗日民主根据地的抗战建设工作，想从此更好为人民服务，以偿平生大愿。孰料范亭方奋力以赴之时，竟以染重病去延休养。在延数年，蒙党百般爱护；尤感欣幸者，得以时常亲聆毛主席和中共中央的教导。范亭奋斗一生，始于今日目睹解放区广大人民的真正翻身，真正看见了新中国的光明前途，每自不禁感奋，热泪夺眶而出，屡欲请求入党，作一名革命军的马前卒，以终余年。但以久病床褥，迄未提出。现范亭已病入膏肓，恐不能亲睹卖国贼蒋介石集团之行将受审，美帝国主义之滚蛋与全中国人民之彻底解放，是人憾耳！范亭数年来愧无贡献，然追求真理之志未尝一日或懈也。在此弥留之际，我以毕生至诚，敬谨请求入党，请中共中央严格审查我的一生历史是否合格，如承追认入党，实平生之大愿也。专此，谨致布尔塞维克的敬礼！续范亭九月十一日。
