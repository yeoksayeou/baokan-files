　　Chiang Kai-shek Orders the Breaching of the Guanmeng Embankment
  　People Along the River Suffer Unprecedented Calamity
    Our Yellow River Committee Calls on the Nation to Denounce the Chiang Bandit
    [Report from this newspaper's correspondent in the JiluYu region, 4th] Our Yellow River Committee spokesperson issued a solemn statement regarding the breaching of the Guanmeng Embankment, stating: Since the UNRRA's withdrawal of personnel responsible for repairing the embankment and their refusal to allow us to repair the embankment around Changyuan, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang has been actively harassing the area south of Fengqiu and Changyuan. On the evening of August 17th, a unit of the Chiang army, in collaboration with local reactionary forces, breached the Guanmeng Embankment, which protects the lives of the people, in two locations under the direction of the Chiang bandit: one at Qian'ewan northeast of Guantai; and the other at Xinzhuangji. This was precisely when the Yellow River was experiencing its second rise in water level. The Chiang bandit's malicious plan was to have the floodwaters from the breach directly hit the Linhuang Embankment northeast of Dacheji. The 47th Division of the Chiang army stationed in Changyuan city was also preparing to breach the Linhuang Embankment immediately in order to inundate our liberated areas, attempting to save their dying fate by using the Yellow River. Fortunately, the military and civilians of northern Henan risked their lives to rescue the situation, thwarting their conspiracy. The Guanmeng Embankment is extremely crucial; it was breached at that location in 1934. Due to this historical fact, we raised this danger with the UNRRA in June, which was also well known to the Chiang side's representatives. Now, the Chiang bandit, supported by American imperialism, has committed this inhumane atrocity, causing an unprecedented disaster for tens of thousands of good people in the Guanmeng Embankment area. Our military and civilians in the liberated areas are desperately trying to provide rescue, while the UNRRA turns a blind eye. How can this kind of one-sided aid to Chiang be justified to the people of the United Nations?! Currently, the autumn floods have not yet passed. If the Yellow River continues to rise, the Chiang bandit will certainly continue to breach the embankments, and the lives and property of millions of people along the river in the JiluYu region will suffer the same calamity as the people in the Guanmeng Embankment area. Therefore, we issue an urgent appeal to all righteous people around the world and to our compatriots across the country to jointly denounce the Chiang bandit and to arrest the bandit gangs who breached the embankments and hand them over to the people for trial.
    [Xinhua News Agency, JinjiLuYu, 3rd] A reporter from the sub-branch stationed at the Yellow River reports the details of the Chiang bandit's breaching of the Guanmeng Embankment, stating: A regiment of the Chiang army stationed in Changyuan, along with the Changyuan puppet security forces and the Home Return Corps, took advantage of the second surge of the Yellow River on the evening of August 17th to advance to the Guanmeng Embankment (i.e., the embankment from Guantai to Menggang) between Xinzhuangji (previously mistakenly reported as Xinzhuang) and Qian'ewan, breaching over a hundred zhang of the embankment. This caused the water to rush directly towards Dacheji, breaching that section of the Linhuang Embankment to inundate our areas of Changyuan, Huaxian, Puyang, Kunwu, Puxian, and Fanxian. At once, the torrential floodwaters flowed northward in two streams from the breach. The eastern stream rushed directly towards Dacheji on the Linhuang Embankment (40 li from Guantai), with a water depth of one meter, before turning east and flowing to Menggangji on the morning of the 24th, with a water depth of one chi. The western stream divided into three routes, flowing northwest: the eastern route reached Sanzhangpo south of Huanglingji (over 10 li northwest of Guantai), the middle route flowed to Daduzhuang southwest of Huanglingji, and the western route flowed west along the Taihang Embankment, turning north to Pingjie, five li northeast of Qingheji. A unit of the People's Liberation Army immediately rushed to the area, simultaneously striking the Chiang army around Dacheji and Guantai to protect the masses in plugging the breach, and mobilizing the masses of Yanjin, Fengqiu, Quhe, and Weinan (newly established county southwest of Huaxian) to repair the Linhuang Embankment and the Taihang Embankment west of Dacheji. On the 20th, when our democratic government led the masses to repair the Taihang Embankment and advanced to Heying Village, they were intercepted and forced to retreat by the Chiang army from Changyuan. The democratic government then dispatched local armed forces to provide cover that evening, leading over 2,000 people to carry out a nighttime repair of the 350-bu of the remaining embankment between Dacheji and Heyang. As of now, half of the repair work has been completed, and it is still continuing. Although our military and civilians disregarded the Chiang army's artillery fire and did their best to carry out emergency rescue, the Yellow River is now experiencing its third surge in water level. The water level at Maojindu on the 26th of last month had already risen by over one zhang. It is difficult to predict whether this section of the remaining embankment under repair will be able to turn danger into safety and whether the Chiang army will once again sneak in to breach the embankment. Note: The Chiang bandit's plot to breach the embankment in the Guanmeng area and flood the liberated areas has been premeditated for a long time. When the Chiang army controlled this section last year, we repeatedly proposed to the Chiang side the repair of the Dacheji section of the Linhuang Embankment, but the Chiang side repeatedly evaded the issue. Until the Dongming talks on August 7th this year, I formally proposed that the three parties be responsible for repairing this section, but was again unreasonably rejected by the Chiang bandit and the UNRRA. For the sake of millions of people, I mobilized 30,000 people to repair the embankment, raising this section of the embankment by five cun, but the Chiang army did everything possible to obstruct the effort. Wang Jiesan, the section chief of the Changyuan repair and defense section, and three engineers were captured by the Chiang army, and their lives and deaths remain unknown.

　　蒋介石掘开贯孟大堤
  　沿河人民遭空前浩劫
    我黄委会呼吁国人声讨蒋贼
    【本报冀鲁豫四日电】为贯孟大堤决口，我黄委会发言人发表郑重声明称：自联总撤退复堤人员，拒绝我们修复长垣一带大堤之后，蒋家匪帮即积极窜扰封邱、长垣以南一带。八月十七日晚，蒋军一部结合土顽，在蒋贼指使下，将保障人民生命的贯孟大堤掘开两处：一在贯台东北前鹅湾；一在新庄集。此时正是黄水第二次上涨，蒋贼的毒计即在使缺口之黄水直撞大车集东北的临黄大堤，长垣城的蒋四十七师亦准备立即将临黄大堤掘开，以淹没我解放区，企图借黄水挽救其垂死的命运。幸我豫北军民冒死救护，使其阴谋未逞。贯孟大堤，极为险要，民国二十三年即曾于该处决口，因这一史实，我们在六月间，即向联总提出此一危险，亦为蒋方代表所熟知。今蒋贼在美帝国主义支持下出此灭绝人性的暴行，已使贯孟堤段数万良善居民，遭到空前的灾难。我解放区军民拚命抢救，而联总则置若罔闻，此种片面援蒋助蒋的态度，将何以对联合国人民！？现秋泛未过，如果黄水续涨，蒋贼必然继续决堤，则冀鲁豫沿河数百万人民的生命财产，亦将与贯孟堤里人民遭受同样浩劫。为此，我们向全世界正义人士及全国同胞，发出紧急呼吁，一致声讨蒋贼，并将扒堤蒋贼匪帮缉捕归案，交给人民审判。
    【新华社晋冀鲁豫三日电】分社驻黄河记者报导蒋贼扒掘贯孟堤之详情称：盘据长垣蒋军一个团与长垣伪保安队、还乡团等，乘黄河第二次猛涨之际，于八月十七日晚进至贯孟堤（即贯台至孟冈之堤）之新庄集（前误为辛庄）与前鹅湾之间，掘堤百余丈，使水头直扑大车集，冲破该段临黄堤以淹没我长垣、滑县、濮阳、昆吾、濮县、范县等地，一时滔滔洪水从缺口处分两股向北分流，东股直扑临黄堤之大车集（距贯台四十里）水深一公尺，从而折向东流，二十四日晨流至孟冈集，水深一市尺。西股水则分路向西北分三路倾泻：东路水到黄陵集（在贯台西北十余里处）以南之三丈坡，中路流至黄陵集西南之大杜庄，西路水顺太行堤西流，折向北到清河集东北五里之平街。人民解放军某部当即奔赴该地区，一面打击大车集与贯台一带之蒋军，掩护群众抢堵缺口。一面动员延津、封邱、曲河、卫南（新设县在滑县西南）等县群众抢修临黄堤及大车集以西之太行堤。二十日当我民主政府领导群众抢修太行堤，进至河营村时，曾被长垣蒋军截击退回。民主政府当晚又派地方武装掩护，带二千余群众实行夜间抢修该段大车集至河阳间之三百五十步残堤。截至目前已完成一半，现正继续抢修中。我军民虽不顾蒋军炮火，尽全力紧急抢救，但黄河现又第三次涨水，茅津渡上月二十六日水已涨达一丈余，此段正在抢修中之残堤，能否化险为夷以及蒋军是否再度窜犯掘堤尚难预断。按：蒋贼欲在贯孟一带扒堤，水淹解放区蓄谋已久，此次乘黄河二次水涨公然掘堤，纯是按照原定计划。去年蒋军控制该段时，我曾再三向蒋方提出修补临黄堤大车集段，而蒋方一直推诿，直至今年八月七日东明会谈中，我又正式提出三方面负责修补该段，复遭蒋贼和联总无理拒绝。我为千百万人民计曾动员三万群众抢修，将该段堤加高五公寸，而蒋军又百般阻挠，长垣修防段段长王杰三及工程师三人，并被蒋军俘去，至今生死不明。
