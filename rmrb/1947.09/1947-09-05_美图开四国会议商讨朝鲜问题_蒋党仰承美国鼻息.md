Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, September 3rd: According to a Central News Agency dispatch on the 30th, the United States has unilaterally decided to convene a four-power conference of the United States, China, Britain, and the Soviet Union to discuss the Korean issue, which was a suggestion made by the Chiang government to Marshall on April 24th of this year. This suggestion, because it conformed to the original plan of the U.S. State Department, was able to win the favor of its American master. The Chiang government has now received an invitation from the United States to attend the meeting, and the Chiang government has expressed its agreement to participate. The Central News Agency's report exposed the Chiang government's despicable and servile attitude of watching the face of its American master and fawning on it.
Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, September 3rd: Due to the continuous dumping of Japanese silk and silk fabrics abroad and in China, Guangdong's silk industry will become even more bleak. According to a Central News Agency dispatch on the 29th, the province's silk industry ranked first in export trade before the war, with annual exports reaching more than 60,000 dan, while the annual export of Cantonese silk last year was only 2,000 dan. At present, of the silk factories equipped with steam engines, less than ten have resumed work. Output is less than one-thirtieth of pre-war levels, most of the old factory buildings are dilapidated, and the mulberry fields are desolate. In other news, due to Japan's resumption of foreign trade, Taiwan's camphor exports have suffered a blow. The industry's annual export volume once reached more than 5 million kilograms, but now it has completely stagnated. According to people in the industry, Japanese camphor is Taiwan camphor's strong competitor.

　　美图开四国会议商讨朝鲜问题
  　蒋党仰承美国鼻息
    【新华社陕北三日电】据中央社三十日电透露，目前美国单独决定召开中美英苏四国会议商讨朝鲜问题，系蒋政府今年四月二十四日向马歇尔献策的。此一献策因与美国务院原定计划符合，故颇能博得其美国主人之欢心。刻蒋政府已接获美国邀请出席该项会议，蒋政府已表示同意参加。中央社的报导暴露了蒋政府看美国主子脸色，奉承献媚的奴才可憎面目。
    【新华社陕北三日电】由于日丝及丝织品之陆续在国外及来华倾销，广东丝业将更呈黯淡。据中央社廿九日讯：该省丝业战前占出口贸易首位，外销年达六万余担，而去年度粤丝外销仅二千担。目前设有蒸气机丝厂，复工者尚不足十家。产量不及战前三十分之一，旧日厂房多破落不堪，桑田则一片荒废。另息：由于日本恢复对外贸易，已使台湾樟脑之输出蒙受打击，该业每年输出额最高曾达五百余万公斤，现则完全呈停顿状态。据该业中人表示：日本樟脑为台湾樟脑之劲敌。
