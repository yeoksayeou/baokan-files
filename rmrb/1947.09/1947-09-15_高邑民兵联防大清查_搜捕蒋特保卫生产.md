　　Gaoyi Militia Joint Defense Conducts Thorough Investigation
  　Search and Capture Chiang Kai-shek Spies to Protect Production
    [This Dispatch from Gaoyi] Yonghe's defeated enemy and puppet troops in Yuanshi city are trapped and extremely fearful. Soldiers are spreading rumors that "it's easy to leave the city, but hard to return." The enemy's small bands don't dare to leave the city easily. After the crops grew tall in August, the enemy used the green gauze tents again to carry out activities, colluding with local special agents and landlords who hid in the sorghum fields during the day and carried out various acts of sabotage at night. In order to protect the interests of the masses, based on the characteristics of the enemy's activities, we conducted a county-wide thorough investigation. The first time was in early August, when we found three members of the puppet party and government work team, including Wu Zhuxiao (deputy brigade leader), seized three Japanese-made rifles, one pistol, and 260 rounds of ammunition, and cracked the special agent and traitor case in Nanchen Village, capturing the main culprit Dong Xiaosheng alive. In order to prevent a single traitor or spy from escaping the net, a joint command was organized by the counties of Gao (yi), Bai (xiang), and Lin (cheng) to jointly manage the triangular area where the three counties connect. After organizing the joint command, the second thorough investigation was carried out, and five more special agents were found, and six hand grenades were seized. Three were found between Wang Village and Daying in the Second District, and one was found in Donghan. In the middle of August, all the militia and armed work teams in our county were involved in this movement, strictly blockading the Huai River, protecting the masses as they watered the seedlings at night. In one month, the county's militia captured 22 Chiang Kai-shek spies, killed two, seized seven guns, 360 rounds of ammunition, and 22 hand grenades, with no casualties on our side.

    [Another Dispatch] A little girl, Tong Changxiuhua, from Xiaozhuang, Gaoyi, discovered a special agent while picking string beans in the field, and immediately reported it to the militia, who arrested him and seized a Bigness rifle and 40 rounds of ammunition. The special agent was Wu Dezi, the propaganda commissioner of the Sanqing Corps of Guangzong, sent by the enemy in Shimen to the liberated area.
    [This Dispatch from Zuoquan] Recently, special agents and landlords have been constantly discovered plotting to abscond and carry out sabotage activities. The militia of Dalin Mountain used the method of thorough investigation and mountain searching to arrest Wang Fu and Wang Hongmo, special agents who had fled from Xiyangjia Village, She County. The sentry of Dongyu Village discovered Zhang Shanren, a landlord and special agent from Yantouling, Licheng. He looked like an honest peasant, but because the writing on his travel permit was unclear and altered, the district decided to send him back to his original place of residence. Who knew that when they reached the Zhang River, Zhang attempted to escape and beat the deputy village chief Li Bingding, who was escorting him, on the head several times. Li struggled up and forcefully pressed the special agent into the river and drowned him.

    【本报高邑讯】元氏敌伪军逆永和部，困守元氏孤城，非常恐惶，士兵中流行着“出城容易回城难”。敌小股经易不敢出城，八月后庄稼长高了，敌利用青沙帐又起来活动，勾结当地特务地主白天藏在高粱地，晚上即进行各种破坏。我们为了保卫群众利益根据敌人活动的特点，进行全县大清查，第一次是在八月初查出伪党政工作队吴猪小（大队副）以下三名，缴获日造步枪三枝，盒子一架，子弹二百六十发，并破获南陈庄特务内奸案，主犯董小生也被生擒。为了不使一个奸特漏网，组织了高（邑）柏（乡）临（城）三县指挥部，共管三县连接处的三角地带，组织起联合指挥部后，即进行第二次大清查，又查出特务五名，缴手榴弹六棵。二区王村至大营间清查出三名，在东韩清查出一名。八月一月中我全县民兵武工队都卷入了这一运动，将槐河严密封锁，保卫了群众夜间浇苗，全县民兵一月捉蒋特二十二名，打死二名，缴枪七枝，子弹三百六十发，手榴弹二十二个，我毫无伤亡。（文彦、连俊）
    【又讯】高邑小庄女儿童常秀花到地里摘豆角发现特务，当即报告民兵去抓着，并缴比尼斯大枪一枝、子弹四十发。该特务系石门敌人派到解放区来的广宗三青团宣传委员吴德子。
    【本报左权讯】最近各地不断查获特务地主阴谋潜逃破坏活动，大林山民兵用清查搜山的办法，把涉县西杨家庄逃跑的特务分子王富的、王鸿模抓着了。东峪村岗哨查获黎城岩头岭地主特务张善仁。看样子象老实农民，因路条上字迹涂改不清，区上决定转送原籍，谁知到漳河边，张企图逃跑，把押送他的村副李炳丁头上打了几个窟窿。李挣扎起来，猛力把该特务按到河里淹死。
