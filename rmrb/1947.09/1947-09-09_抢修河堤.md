　　Rushing to Repair the Riverbank
　　Xiao Yubai
　　Linqing City is a relatively prosperous city in our area. In the past, merchants would generally "sit deep in their halls, fanning themselves" during the summer. Now, it's completely different. Thanks to the happy lives of freedom and democracy in the liberated areas, they deeply understand that the interests of everyone are their own. As soon as they heard the call from higher authorities to repair the embankment, men, women, old and young, immediately set to work and joined the movement.
　　I followed the masses to the riverbank. The sun was almost setting, but the lively voices were still roaring: "Work hard! Add more effort!" On both sides of the riverbank slope, people repairing the river were carrying baskets and digging soil, busily coming and going. In that dense crowd, there were groups of women, gangs of children, and merchants who had just taken off their watches and were wearing bright white trousers, all of whom had volunteered to participate. The women who had been liberated were working shoulder to shoulder with the men here. A pair of women, nearly thirty years old, were carrying a basket piled high with soil, transporting it on the slope. A female street leader wearing a floral shirt and white jacket, with a large straw hat on her head, was covered in sweat. She was digging soil with a hoe while directing the work of the masses under her street's jurisdiction. A strong man who had been working for many years, with his tan arms bare, said to the group of women, "Why don't you use smaller baskets? We'll use the big ones." Another strong man was digging soil with an iron shovel, saying, seemingly to no one in particular, "When the puppet troops were here, during city repairs and emergency rescue work, they would hold military batons and whips, urging and beating us from behind. Grandma, I was the same, 'dragging my feet' for them. But this time? He's working very enthusiastically."
　　In such a warm and tense atmosphere, the loudspeaker sounded. It was the government sending someone to broadcast praises for the models: "The female street leader Zhang Li from Shangmian Street didn't sleep all night for the river work task, and her work hasn't stopped." "Li Chunhua from Xinkai Street didn't sleep all night, and his work hasn't slackened in the slightest. Shen Chunhua from Taoyuan Street carried eighteen loads of soil in a row, and as a result, broke his carrying pole."
　　As soon as the broadcast ended, a huge shout erupted from the crowd: "... Work hard! ... Work hard! ... Learn from the models! ..."

　　抢修河堤
    萧玉柏
    临清市在我们这个地区里是一个比较繁华的城市。以往的夏天，一般商人差不多都是“深坐高堂把扇摇”的；现在大不一样了，由于解放区民主自由的幸福生活，使他们深深体验到大家的利益就是自己的利益，一听到上级修堤的号召，男女老少一齐下手，立即卷入到运动中去。
    我随群众走到河堤，夕阳已快下山了，热闹的人声依然闹成一片：“干呀！加油干呀！”河堤的两斜面，修河的人即抬筐掘土，来往奔忙。在那稠密的人堆里，有一群群的妇女、一伙伙的儿童，还有刚刚摘下手表，穿着亮白裤衩的商人们，他们都是自愿参加来的。翻身后的妇女们，在这里和男人们比肩劳作。一对年近三十岁的妇女，抬着一筐堆得尖尖的土，在斜坡上转运。一位穿着花裤白褂的女街长，头戴大草帽，满脸尽是汗水珠。一面轮着＠头挖土，一面指挥着她街所辖的群众的工作。一个长年劳动的壮年，光着酱色的臂膊，对那伙妇女们说：“＠们用小筐抬吧。俺们用大筐。”另一个壮年双手用铁锨掘着土，不知对谁说话“皇协军在这儿，修城抢险的时候，都是拿着军棍鞭子在后面催着打着，奶奶、那我也是一样的给他‘磨洋工’。而这回呢？他却干得很起劲。”
    在这样热烈紧张的空气中，喇叭响了，是政府派人广播，表扬模范：“上面街女街长张李氏，为了河工任务，一夜没睡觉，工作没休停。”“新开街的李春华一夜没睡觉，工作丝毫没懈怠。桃园街沈春华一连挑了十八担土，结果把担子压折了。”
    广播的声音一落，下面一片巨大的喊声从人群中沸腾起来：“……干呀！……干呀！……学习模范呀！……”
