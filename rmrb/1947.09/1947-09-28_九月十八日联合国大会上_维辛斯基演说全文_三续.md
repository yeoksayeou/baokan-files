In the Soviet Union, what is devoted to is peaceful construction and the safeguarding of peace

In the Soviet Union, in a socialist democracy, in a country engaged in the peaceful construction of a new life, there is not and cannot be anything remotely similar to what is happening in some countries that consider themselves democratic and progressive, but which permit shameful acts such as the propagation of war and the poisoning of social psychology with the toxins of hatred and hostility towards other countries. If anyone in the Soviet Union were to allow themselves to utter words even slightly resembling the above, and imbued with the sinister desire for new massacres, such words would be regarded as a serious act of harm to society, and would be met with severe rebukes and public condemnation. However, there are those who make a profession of insulting and cursing the Soviet Union, the countries of Eastern Europe, and democratic elements in other countries who oppose a new war, spare no effort in fabricating false and slanderous statements, concocted by provocateurs and warmongers and spread by countless means throughout the world. They constantly proclaim the inevitability and even necessity of a new war, under the pretext of a so-called preemptive strike against the aggressive policies of the Soviet Union and other countries of Eastern Europe. This is truly a brazen shift of blame. It is truly, as a Soviet proverb says, "The bear desperately beats the ox, while shouting for help."

American warmongers threaten the world with war preparations

The preparation for a new war is genuinely underway before the eyes of the entire world. Propagandists and warmongers do not even want to conceal this. They openly threaten peace-loving countries with war, while attempting to shift the responsibility for launching a new massacre onto the latter. From several signs, the preparation for a new war has gone beyond the stage of pure propaganda, psychological pressure, and nerve warfare. Countless facts prove that in certain countries, particularly the United States, practical measures of military strategy, coupled with organizational and technical measures—such as the construction and organization of new military bases; the reorganization of troops to adapt to future military action plans; the intensification of the manufacture of new armaments; and the feverish work of making armaments increasingly sophisticated—all of this is fueling war hysteria. At the same time, military blocs are being formed, military agreements under the guise of so-called collective defense pacts are being concluded, measures for unified armaments are being adopted, and general staff headquarters are formulating new war plans… It is not without reason that the well-known American radio commentator Pearson, in his recent broadcast, felt compelled to admit that American officers are slowly but thoroughly preparing for the next world war with the Soviet Union as their opponent. This is the situation in which the propagandists and instigators of a new world war are engaging. Fearing a new crisis, they incite a new war, hoping to avoid the imminent collapse and the threat of lost profits. The instigators of a new war are brewing a mad plan, which is to use armed force to conquer those countries that are fighting for independence and refuse to allow other countries to interfere in their internal affairs. Warmongers are striving to force their own domestic and foreign policy standards on other countries. On the one hand, they incite a new war and encourage their followers to oppose certain countries; at the same time, those who hope to ignite another war inferno expect to achieve their goals through local wars. Obviously, they have not seen the experience of past wars, which teaches people that every new war in the modern era inevitably turns into a new world war. They have forgotten that a world war, with its senseless destruction, the leveling of countless cities, the elimination of millions of people, and the enormous material value accumulated by human labor, would mean another major catastrophe for humanity, and would set humanity back decades.

American monopoly capitalists need war

The active role in the propaganda of a new war is being played by representatives of American monopoly capitalists, the largest corporations, and representatives of major American industries, banks, and exchanges. It is precisely those people who obtained huge profits in the Second World War, and as a result of the war accumulated enormous wealth, a situation similar to that of the First World War. If we compare the five years before the war, from 1935 to 1939, with the five years of the Second World War, from 1940 to 1944, we can see that the total profits of all American companies, after taxes, in the five years before the war was $15.3 billion, while in the five years of the Second World War, the total profits of these companies, after taxes, reached $42.3 billion. According to the Department of Commerce's materials, the total net profit of these companies during the six years of war from 1940 to 1945 was $52 billion. The Economic Review magazine published by the Congress of Industrial Organizations, in its November 1946 issue, presented an interesting figure indicating the increase in profits (after taxes) of fifty companies in 1945 and 1946. These figures show that the total war-time excessive profits obtained by some monopoly enterprises reached 200%, 300% or even more, and in some cases, this profit reached 500% or even 800%, as in the case of the Atlantic Sugar Company. According to this magazine, these profits exceeded the average profit from 1936 to 1939 by more than four times. As for commercial profits, according to the Director of the Economic Stabilization Agency, Stillman, reached an unprecedented height in October 1946, so for those social groups in some countries who can very well profit from the disasters of war and seek wealth, war is not such a very unpleasant thing. Therefore, it is not accidental; Allen, in his book "International Independence and Peace," pointed out that in the economic life of capitalist countries, one can see the imbalance and fundamental disconnections, and quoted a sentence from a report by a government agency that studied this issue, according to which it can be concluded that only under the conditions of war can the modern economic system obtain near-full employment. This frank admission hardly needs any annotation: it itself is a sufficiently eloquent explanation. It should be pointed out that the capital monopolies that gained decisive influence during the war have maintained this influence even after the war, skillfully utilizing billions of dollars in government subsidies and various protections from various government agencies and organizations that they have enjoyed in the past and continue to enjoy. This convenience is due to the close ties between monopolists and senators and other government personnel, who themselves are often directors or participants in monopoly enterprises. These circumstances have also affected industrial scientific research concentrated in the laboratories of major factories, joint-stock companies, trusts, and concerns. This is also the case in research on the utilization of atomic energy. Capital monopolies such as DuPont Chemical Trust, Monsanto Chemical Trust, Westinghouse Company, General Electric Company, and Mobil Oil Company are most closely related to this work and are the giants in this field. Before the war, they maintained close ties with German trusts through cartels and many cartel agreements, which stipulated that information should be re-exchanged even after the war. All these facts are entirely sufficient to explain why the various monopoly capitalists are particularly concerned with the manufacture of atomic weapons. These facts provide a clear explanation of why the just demand for the prohibition of atomic weapons and the destruction of stockpiled atomic bombs has met with stubborn resistance, these stockpiled atomic bombs cost vast amounts of money to create. If it were not for profits, and the effort to maintain and develop the war industry that guarantees these high profits at any cost, the monopolists would not aggravate the militaristic expansion and aggressive tendencies in these policies, thereby influencing foreign policy to satisfy the insatiable appetites of powerful monopoly capitalists.

    九月十八日联合国大会上
    维辛斯基演说全文  三续
    苏联致力的是和平建设与保卫和平
    在苏联，在社会主义的民主国度里，在进行和平建设新的生活的国家中，没有也不可能有与某些国家中所发生的一些事情丝毫相类似的东西，这些国家自以为是民主与进步的，可是却又诺许象宣传战争及以憎恨和敌视他国的毒素来毒害社会心理的可耻行动。如果在苏联有任何人容许自己发表与上述各点稍微相似之处的言论，并渗有希求新的屠杀的罪恶渴望，那么，这种言论，就会被视为对社会的严重危害行动，而遭受严厉回击和公众的斥责。然而，却有以侮辱与咒骂苏联、东欧各国以及其他各国内民主分子与反对新战争的人为职业的人，正在不遗余力制造着虚伪的与诽谤性的说法，这些说法是挑拨者和战争贩子所杜撰出来并经由无数方法广布到全世界去的。他们不断宣扬新战争的不可避免甚至必需，其借口是所谓必须对苏联及东欧其他各国的侵略政策来一个先发制人。这真是一种胡赖推诿的责骂。真是，象苏联的谚语所说：“熊拼命打牛，嘴里却大喊救命。”
    美国战争贩子以备战狂威胁世界
    新战争的准备，正真正在全世界的眼前进行着。宣传家与战争贩子对于这点甚至也不想加以掩饰。他们公开以战争威胁爱好和平的国家，同时又企图把发动新屠杀的责任，转嫁到后者身上。从若干征象看来，新战争的准备已经超出纯粹宣传心理压力和神经战的阶段了。无数的事实证明，在某些国家特别是美国，军事战略性的实际措施，再加以组织性和技术性的措施——如同建设、组织新军事基地；适应未来军事行动计划重新布置军队；加强制造新的军备，以及使军备益臻精良的狂热的工作，这一切正在煽动着战争的歇斯底里。同时，军事集团正在组成，所谓联防公约的军事协定正在缔结，统一军备的措施正在采取，而且参谋总部也正在制定新的战争的计划……。美国著名广播评论家皮尔逊在他最近的广播中，感到他自己不得不承认美国的军官，正在缓慢地，但是彻底地准备着以苏联为对手的下一次世界大战，并不是毫无理的。这就是新的世界战争的宣传家和煽动家正在进行的情况。害怕新的危机，他们就煽动新的战争，希望因而避免逼近的崩溃与丧失利润的威胁，新战争的煽动者酝酿一疯狂的计划，那就是用武装的力量来征服那些为独立而战，并且拒绝其他国家干涉他们内政的国家。战争贩子正力图把他们自己国内国外的政策的标准强迫他国接受。一方面煽动新战争，并鼓动他们的追随者来反对某些国家；同时，那些希望发动另一战争烽火的人们，又期望用局部的战争去达到他们的目的。显然，他们没有看到过去战争的经验，这种经验教导人们说：在现代每一个新战争都不可能避免地要变成新的世界战争。他们忘记了世界大战带来无意义的破坏，平毁了无数城市，消灭了成百万的人民，以及由人类劳动积累起来的巨大的物质价值，将意味着人类的另一次最大的灾难，并将把人类推后几十年去。
    美独占资本家需要战争
    在新战争宣传中活跃的角色，是由美国独占资本家的代表、最大企业和美国主要工业、银行和交易所的代表们担任的。正是那些人在第二次世界大战中得到浩大利润，并由于战争结果积累了庞大财富，这种情形与过去第一次大战的情形一样。假如我们把战前由一九三五到一九三九的五年与第二次世界大战的由一九四○到一九四四的五年来比较，我们就可以看出美国的一切公司在战前的五年，在纳税后，其利润总数是一五三亿美元，而在第二次世界大战中的五年，这些公司的利润，在纳税后，总数达四二三亿元。按照商业部的材料，这些公司在一九四○至一九四五的六年战争期间的纯利总数是五二○亿元。产业工会联合会出版的经济评论杂志，在一九四六年第十一期提出一个有趣的数字，表示在一九四五年和一九四六年五十家公司利润的增长情形（在纳税后）。这些数字表示有些独占企业所得的战时过分利润总计达到百分之二百、三百甚至三百以上，而在某些场合，这种利润竟达百分之五百，甚至于八百，例如大西洋糖业公司就是这样。据这个杂志说，这种利润超过一九三六年至一九三九年的平均利润四倍以上。至于说到商业利润，据经济稳定局局长史蒂尔曼说，在一九四六年十月达到空前的高度，所以对于某些国家内很能在战争灾难中取利以求发财的那些社会集团说来，战争并不是那么很可厌的东西。因此，不是偶然的；爱伦在他所著的“国际独立与和平”一书指出了，在资本主义国家经济生活中，可以看到失去平衡和根本脱节的情形，并且从研究这一问题的政府机关报告中引了一句话，据此可以作出结论，说只有在战争的条件下，现代经济制度才可能获得近乎全部的就业。这个坦白的承认几乎不需要任何的注解：它本身就是足够雄辩的说明了。应该指出的是在战时取得了决定性影响的资本独占，甚至在战后还保持着这种影响，机巧地利用政府成十亿美元的补助金以及他们过去所享受并且仍然享受着的各种政府机关与组织方面的各种保护。这种方便是由于独占家与参议员及其他政府人员有密切连系所致，而这些参议员与政府人员本身也常是属于独占企业的董事或参与人。这些情形也影响了集中在各大工厂、股份公司、托辣斯、康采伦的实验室里的工业科学研究。在利用原子能的研究上也是如此。这种资本独占，如象杜邦化学托辣斯、孟山托化学托辣斯、威斯丁豪斯公司、通用电汽公司、美孚油公司等，是与这种工作有最密切联系的，而且也是这一方面的巨擘。在战前，他们和德国托辣斯通过卡特尔及许多卡特尔协定保持密切的联系，这些协定规定在战后仍要重新交换情报。所有这些事实，完全足以说明各独占资本家分外关心制造原子武器的缘故。这些事实提供了确切的说明，为什么禁用原子武器以及毁灭储存的原子弹的正义要求，遇到了顽强的抵抗，这些储存的原子弹是花费了浩大的金钱装成的。资本主义的独占家若不是为了利润，和不惜任何代价以保持并发展这些保障高度的利润的战争工业的努力，他们就不会去加重这些政策中的军国主义的扩张和侵略倾向，从而左右外交政策，以求满足有势力的独占资本家们贪得无厌的胃口。（未完。待四续）
