　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st: Moscow News: Harvesting in collective farms across the Soviet Union is nearing completion. According to the Associated Press, "This year's harvest of various grains in the Soviet Union will break the 1940 record and be the largest harvest in Soviet history." Farmers from various collective farms have written to Stalin, guaranteeing to complete all harvesting in the shortest possible time and to pay grain exceeding the planned amount. In the Kiev province of Ukraine alone, the current grain payment has reached 166.25 million tons, far exceeding the amount paid at the same time last year. The collective farm in Ber-Peterovsk, Germany, completed its grain payment plan in early August. Farmers and collective farms have received higher incomes. The government has allowed 15 percent of the grain paid to the public to be prepaid to collective farmers as wages. Many farmers have received hundreds of kilograms or more of grain, and their lives are becoming more prosperous. The annual income of hundreds of collective farms across the country is calculated in millions of rubles, and a certain farm in Uzbekistan has an income of more than ten million rubles this year. The cultivated land of collective farms has been greatly expanded, and it has become more mechanized and electrified.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st: Bucharest News: Romania celebrates this year's bumper harvest. According to the Romanian Ministry of Agriculture, it is estimated that this year's harvest of various grains will greatly exceed the average harvest in Romania in the past 20 years, which will greatly improve food supply and people's lives. The currently harvested area is 1.71 million hectares (approximately 16 Chinese acres per hectare). As of August 20, 1 million tons of grain have been harvested. The harvest of sunflowers, corn, and sugar grapes has more than doubled the average yield from 1942 to 1946. As a result of the bumper harvest, a wave of paying public grain has unfolded across the country. Within a few days, farmers have paid 200,500 tons of public grain.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st: According to an Associated Press dispatch from London on the 28th of last month, widespread famine is now threatening the people of Western and Northern European countries. The severe cold last winter and the drought this summer have greatly damaged the harvests of these countries. The worst drought in 50 years has struck all crops in Germany, especially potatoes. France's poor harvest this year will force it to import two-thirds of the five million tons of wheat it will need in the next twelve months. Britain has not had a thorough rain since August 6, so its sugar beets, late potatoes, and vegetables have all been affected by the drought. Drought has become apparent in Austria. And Sweden's wheat and rye harvests will be reduced by 40 percent. In order to maintain existing food rations, Sweden must import approximately 350,000 tons of grain in the future. In Denmark, due to the poor hay harvest, the authorities have ordered a large slaughter of livestock.

　　苏罗空前丰收
  　西欧北欧普遍饥荒
    【新华社陕北一日电】莫斯科讯：苏联全国各地集体农场之收割，已近于完成。据合众社称：“苏联今年各种谷物收成将打破一九四○年之纪录，而为苏联历史上最大之丰收”。各集体农场农民纷纷上书斯大林，保证在最短期间完成全部收割，并缴纳超过计划规定之谷物。乌克兰仅基辅一省，目前所缴之谷物，即达一亿六千六百二十五万吨，远超过去年同时缴纳之数量。德国伯彼得罗夫斯克之集体农场，于八月上旬即已完成缴粮计划。农民与集体农场已得到更高之收入。政府已允将缴公谷物之百分之十五预支集体农民之工资。许多农民获得数百公斤以上之粮食，生活益形富裕。全国数百个集体农场岁入以百万卢布计，乌兹贝克某农场，今年收入在千万卢布以上。集体农场之耕地已大大扩展，并更加机械化与电气化。
    【新华社陕北一日电】布加勒斯特讯：罗马尼亚全国喜庆今年的大丰收。据罗农业部公布，估计今年各种谷物的收成，大大超过罗国过去二十年中的平均收获量，因此将使粮食供应和人民的生活大为改善。目前已收割的面积达一百七十一万公顷（一公顷约合十六华亩）至八月二十日，已收成一百万吨谷物。向日葵、玉蜀黍、糖果葡的收获，均超过一九四二年至四六年平均产量的一倍余。由于大丰收的结果交纳公粮的浪潮在全国展开，在数天内，农民已交公粮二十万零五千吨。
    【新华社陕北一日电】据美联社上月廿八日伦敦电，普遍的饥荒现正威胁着西欧与北欧各国的人民。去冬的酷寒与今夏的干旱，已使这些国家的收成大受损害。五十年来最大的一次旱灾袭击着德国的一切农作物，特别是马铃薯。法国今年的歉收，使其在今后十二月中，将不得不输入它所需五百万吨麦子中的三分之二。英国自八月六日以来即未降透雨，因此其甜萝卜，晚马铃薯，蔬菜等收获，都受旱灾影响。奥地利旱象已成。而瑞典的小麦与裸麦收成将受损失百分之四十，为了维持现有口粮配给，瑞典今后必须进口约三十五万吨谷物。在丹麦，则因草秣歉收，当局已下令大宰牲畜。
