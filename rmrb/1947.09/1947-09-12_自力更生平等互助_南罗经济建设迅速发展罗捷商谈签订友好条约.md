Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, August 8th: Belgrade dispatch: Yugoslavia’s economic recovery and development are rapid. According to a communiqué issued by the Yugoslav State Planning Commission on the achievements of the Five-Year Plan in the first half of this year: financial income has exceeded the plan by 8 percent, national industrial production has exceeded it by 3 percent, and output has increased sharply by 49 percent compared with the same period last year. More than 200 large factories are currently under construction, while before the war, only an average of two new factories could be built each year. In terms of railway and inland river transportation, 98.3 percent of the plan has been completed. The railway bridge across the Danube, with a total length of 620 meters, was officially opened to traffic on August 15th, 25 days ahead of the original plan, and saved 25 million dinars in original expenses. In terms of social welfare, special care is given to the working people and women. Working people can receive free medical care and hospital treatment, and can also receive extra sick leave pay, accounting for 50 to 88 percent of wages. Women receive pregnancy allowances, accounting for 75 to 88 percent of monthly wages, and can take leave during childbirth with full pay. At present, hospitals with pediatric departments, maternity hospitals, nurseries and maternal and child welfare institutions have been established in various regional centers according to plan.
　　
Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, August 8th: Belgrade dispatch: The first machinery factory in Yugoslavia, built according to the Five-Year Plan, officially started operation in Ljubljana on the 2nd. Yugoslav Prime Minister Marshal Tito personally presided over the opening ceremony and delivered a speech, stating: "When we considered building a foundry, some people ridiculed it as 'megalomania', but today our country's first Siemens-Martin furnace has started operation, and our plan has proven to be feasible." Marshal Tito strongly criticized the foreign reactionaries' attempt to permanently maintain Yugoslavia as a raw material exporting country and stifle its heavy industrial development, and pointed out: "We can no longer be fooled." Marshal Tito finally urged the people to step up production and emphasized: "Every piece of iron cast in Yugoslavia is tantamount to a blow to the reactionaries."
　　
Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, August 7th: Bucharest dispatch: Romania's economic recovery plan, which began on July 1st, has achieved great success. Industry, which in 1946 was less than half the pre-war level, is now approaching the pre-war level, with steel production reaching 75.5 percent, chemicals at 78 percent, the rubber industry exceeding pre-war levels, and the cement industry even exceeding pre-war levels by 28 percent. Due to the nationalization of banks, the control of monopolies and industrial production, financial revenue and expenditure have tended to balance. At the same time, the Romanian government implemented currency reform on the 18th of last month, stipulating that one new leu is equal to 20,000 old lei, and ordering the exchange of old currency, gold, and foreign currency for new currency. According to the declaration of the Democratic Political Parties Alliance, this move "curbed speculation, increased the purchasing power of the people, and provided the necessary investment for economic recovery." Romania's economic recovery has received full assistance from the Soviet Union and other new democratic countries. The raw materials, semi-finished products and metals imported from the Soviet Union have enabled Romania to restore its metallurgical machinery manufacturing industry and some light industries. The cheap coal, coking coal, steel plates, iron sheets and fertilizers supplied by Poland, and the machines supplied by Hungary and Czechoslovakia, have greatly helped the development of Romania's industry.
　　
Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, August 10th: Prague dispatch: The Romanian delegation, led by Romanian Prime Minister Groza, arrived in Prague on the 3rd. The delegation included Foreign Minister Tatarescu and many other government officials. Czech Prime Minister Gottwald, Foreign Minister Masaryk and others went to the station to welcome them. The two prime ministers exchanged congratulatory messages, unanimously emphasizing that the Romanian delegation's visit to Czechoslovakia "will greatly strengthen European peace." The representatives of the two countries immediately began talks in an atmosphere of friendship and cooperation. On the evening of the 5th, both sides issued a communiqué stating that the two countries had signed a five-year cultural cooperation agreement; agreed on taking joint action on the issue of Danube navigation to safeguard the rights and interests of the countries along the river, and decided to upgrade the envoys of the two countries from ministers to ambassadors. At this time, both sides are discussing the signing of a trade agreement and conducting negotiations on extensive economic cooperation and the signing of a treaty of friendship and cooperation between the two countries.
