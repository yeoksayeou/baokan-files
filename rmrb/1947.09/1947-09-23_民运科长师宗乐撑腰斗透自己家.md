    Civil Affairs Section Chief Shi Zongle Supports the Struggle Session Against His Own Family
    [Report from Taiyue, September 14th] The masses of Chengnan Village, Yicheng First District, are brewing a struggle session against Shi Zonghong, a military and cadre family member. His brother, Shi Zongle, is the Civil Affairs Section Chief of a certain brigade of our field army. His family was liquidated by the masses during the land reform this spring, but the review found it very incomplete. The masses planned to conduct another resolute struggle session. Just as the struggle session was about to begin, Comrade Zongle returned home. At that time, although the masses shouted "Break personal feelings," they seemed very unnatural. Many people were considering: he has been in the revolution outside for ten years, wouldn't it be too unkind to do it this way? Comrade Zongle saw this contradictory psychology of the masses, so he first stated his attitude in front of the masses, saying: "I joined the Eighth Route Army revolution to serve the masses. This time I directly participated in the peasant's emancipation in Jishan, struggling against the landlords. Since my family is a landlord, it is entirely right for everyone to struggle against them today." He then mobilized his brother Zonghong, his mother, and his wife to hand over all their property, houses, land, ninety taels of silver, twenty-three silver dollars, and baggage to the masses. The family of six lived in the threshing ground, and he ordered his ten-year-old child to help the masses transport fruit. The masses, mindful of his meritorious service in the revolution and the family's lack of labor, wanted to leave him a mule. Comrade Zongle also firmly refused. In the end, they left his family with twenty-five mu of bad land and six rooms (according to the village's average land, this is a lower-middle peasant's share). The moved masses said: "Chairman Mao's cadres truly serve the masses."

    民运科长师宗乐撑腰斗透自己家
    【本报太岳十四日电】翼城一区城南村群众，正在酝酿斗争军、干属师宗鸿，其弟师宗乐是我野战兵团某旅之民运科长，其家庭在今春土改中，已被群众清算过，此次复查发现很不彻底，群众计划再次坚决斗争，正在斗争之际，宗乐同志返里，当时群众虽喊着“打破情面”，但表现很不自然，许多人在考虑：人家十年革命在外，这样干法未免太不好看。宗乐同志看出群众这种矛盾心理，便首先在群众面前表明态度说：“我参加八路军革命，就是为群众服务的，此次我在稷山直接参加农民闹翻身，斗争地主，我的家庭既是地主，今天大家要斗争完全对的。”继即动员其兄宗鸿及母亲妻子将全部财产、房屋、土地及九十两元宝、二十三元现洋和包袱等，交给群众，一家六口人住在场房里，并令其十岁的孩子帮助群众运送果实，群众念其革命有功，家庭又无劳力，给他留一头骡子，宗乐同志也坚决拒绝了，最后给其全家留下二十五亩坏地、六间房（按该村平均土地，是个下中农），感动的群众说：“毛主席的干部，真是为群众服务的。”
