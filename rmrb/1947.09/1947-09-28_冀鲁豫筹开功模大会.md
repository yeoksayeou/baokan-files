The conference preparatory committee was established on September 10th, with eleven leading comrades from the departments of the headquarters, political department, and supply organs serving as members, and three sections were established under it: organization, propaganda, and general affairs.

In order to better mobilize enthusiastic celebration of the meritorious individuals and models, the preparatory committee is also preparing to invite party, government, and mass organizations of the military region to participate in guidance and offer words of praise to the meritorious individuals and models to express congratulations.
