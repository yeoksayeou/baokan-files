    Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains Front, 25th: Frontline reporter Zhang Tiefu reports: When speaking of the crimes of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits, the people of the Central Plains all curse them with gnashing teeth. On September 11th, this reporter accompanied a unit of Liu Deng's army through the mountainous area of Shuanglunhe, northeast of Guangshan County. Chiang Kai-shek's 48th Division had been rampaging through this area on the 9th and 10th. When our army arrived and drove away Chiang Kai-shek's bandits, no one was to be seen in the thousand or so villages nearby that had been ravaged by them. In Jiangjiawan, a village of only eight households, Chiang Kai-shek's bandits had seized ten able-bodied men, and all the chickens in the village had been taken. Li Xiaoshun, a resident of the village, said while weeping, "My daughter-in-law was cooking when the pot was snatched away by Chiang Kai-shek's army. They robbed my family of rice, eggs, ten ducks, and ten liang of oil, leaving my family without food for three days. My son was also captured by Chiang Kai-shek's army." All the grain, vegetables, oil, salt, etc., belonging to the villagers were looted by Chiang Kai-shek's bandits, and most of the cooking pots were also taken away. The villagers hid the remaining pots in the ponds. In this area, Chiang Kai-shek's bandits captured more than two hundred innocent farmers. In the four villages of Shuanglunhe, Fengzhai, and others, twenty innocent farmers were brutally murdered by Chiang Kai-shek's bandits, including two young women who were shot to death for resisting rape by Chiang Kai-shek's bandits. Tong Fulin of Tongtian Village was harvesting rice in the field when Chiang Kai-shek's bandits tried to seize him. He fled into the mountains but was unfortunately shot and killed by pursuing soldiers of Chiang Kai-shek's army, suffering four bullet wounds. A 19-year-old girl surnamed Li from Guaigang Village was cooking at home when Chiang Kai-shek's bandits tried to rape her. The girl struggled and resisted and was immediately shot to death by Chiang Kai-shek's bandits.
    During the Land Revolution and the War of Resistance Against Japan, the broad masses of people in this area established close ties of flesh and blood with the Red Army and the New Fourth Army. They longed for their own army every day and hated the reactionaries in their hearts, waiting for the day to avenge themselves. This time, when the liberation army arrived, the people came forward one after another to accuse Chiang Kai-shek's bandits of their tyrannical rule and the suffering they had endured. Yu Jinzhi of Zengjia, Shangcheng County, is 51 years old. He told the reporter that he rents two mu of land from a landlord surnamed Liu, which yields one shi of grain a year, but he has to pay one shi and four dou as rent. Moreover, before renting the land, he had to pay five silver dollars, otherwise he would not be allowed to rent it. He has nothing to eat, so his wife takes their two children to beg for food, while he himself climbs into the mountain forests every day to collect firewood to exchange for some grain. However, the landlords own all the firewood on the barren mountains and do not allow the poor to collect it. He said: The day before yesterday, I went to collect some firewood and was seen by the landlord, who insisted that I was stealing and told me to "fang pao" (Note: This is a method used by landlords to humiliate the poor). He said that all the local landlords do not contribute grain or money, and all the exorbitant taxes and levies fall on the poor, with the grain and money paid in one year being enough for a family to eat for several years. Finally, he tugged at his ragged clothes and said, "If you had come a few days later, the poor people here would not be able to survive. We've been waiting for you day and night, and you've finally arrived. You must not leave this time!"

    受尽蒋匪地主熬煎
    中原人民热盼我军
    农民说：黑天白日盼你们到底来了！
    【新华社中原前线二十五日电】前线记者张铁夫报导：提起蒋匪的罪恶，中原同胞无不切齿痛骂。九月十一日，记者随刘邓大军某部经过光山县东北双轮河一带山区，此地在九、十两日有蒋匪四十八师窜扰，当我军到达把蒋匪驱走时，附近千余个遭蒋匪蹂躏的村庄不见一人。仅有八户人家的姜家湾，曾被蒋匪抓去十个壮丁，全村的鸡被捉光了。该村居民李孝顺的六十多岁的老母亲边哭边诉说：“我儿媳正在做饭，锅就被蒋军抢去了，把我家的米、鸡蛋、十只鸭、十两油都抢走了，弄得我一家人三天没吃饭。我儿也叫蒋军给抓走了。”该村老百姓所有的粮食、菜、油、盐等，全部被蒋匪抢光，做饭的锅也大部被揭走。老百姓把剩下的锅都藏到水塘里去，在这一带蒋匪共抓走青壮农民二百余人。双轮河、冯寨等四个村，还有二十名无辜农民遭蒋匪残杀，其中包括反抗蒋匪强奸而遭枪杀之两名青年妇女。同畋村同福林正在地里割稻子，蒋匪要抓他，他往山里逃，但不幸遭蒋匪追兵枪击，身中四弹而死。拐岗村李姓的十九岁少女，正在家里做饭，蒋匪欲行强奸，该女挣扎反抗，即被蒋匪枪杀。
    这一带广大人民在土地革命时期及抗日战争时期，与红军、新四军建立了血肉联系，对自己军队是天天想望，对反动派则是痛恨在心，久思报仇。这次解放大军一到，人民纷纷向我军控诉蒋匪暴政及所受痛苦。商城县曾家余金志，现年五十一岁，他告诉记者说，他租种刘姓地主二亩田，一年可收一石谷子，但要交一石四斗租子。而且在租地以前还交了五块响洋，否则就不叫租种；他没有吃的，老婆领着两个孩子去讨饭，他自己每天爬到山树林里去拾茅柴，换点粮食吃。但是，这里荒山上的木柴，地主都据为己有，不准穷人去拾柴。他说：前天我去拾了些茅柴，被地主见了，硬说我是偷的，叫我“放炮”（按：此为地主侮辱穷人的一种方法。）他说，本地所有地主，都不出粮不出款，苛捐杂税都落在穷人头上，一年交的粮款足够一家人吃几年。最后他扯扯身上的破烂衣裳说：“你们再晚些日子来，这里的穷人就活不成了。我们黑夜白日盼你们，你们到底来了。你们这回一定不能走了！”
