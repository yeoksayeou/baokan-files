　　"Ask the Poor Peasants if it's Okay"
　　The Process of Establishing Core Leadership of Poor Peasants in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Region
　　The class line of establishing core leadership of poor peasants has been widely applied in the review movement in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region. Since the review started in late June, Hebei-Shandong-Henan has clearly implemented this mass line in ideological guidance. During the two-month movement, they have consistently regarded poor peasants as the basic driving force for land reform review. The slogan "Ask the poor peasants if it's okay" has resounded throughout the villages. The leadership consciously elevated the demands of the poor peasants to the level of Party policy and regarded them as the basic direction in the land reform review. As for the concrete manifestation of uniting with middle peasants: when concentrating the opinions of poor peasants as the main direction of the review, they simultaneously sought the opinions of middle peasants to gain their consent and sympathy. In this way, they listened to the opinions of the majority of the masses and united the majority.
　　In order to better enlighten the consciousness of the poor peasants, concentrate their opinions, realize their demands, and provide a solid organizational guarantee for the review, Hebei-Shandong-Henan also established separate leadership organizations for poor peasants (poor peasant groups) in the review. In Nanle, Qingfeng, Puyang, Qingxi and other counties of Hebei-Shandong-Henan, this kind of poor peasant organization has been widely established. Each village has established poor peasant groups and poor peasant representative meetings, becoming the full-power organs for leading the peasant struggle. In Chaocheng, Guancheng, Neihuang and other counties, this kind of poor peasant leadership organization has also been partially established, but the names vary: some are called Filling and Leveling Committees, some are called Turn-Over Teams, some are called Turn-Over Committees, and some are called Review Committees; in Shouyang and other places, they are also called Poor Peasant Vanguard Teams. Qingfeng also calls them Poor Peasant Inspection Groups.
　　At the beginning of the review, in areas with a better work foundation, the commonly adopted organizational form for poor peasants to lead the review was the general meeting of poor peasants or the representative meeting of poor peasants. This kind of large-scale poor peasant meeting (the poor peasant meeting in the 14th district of Zhuxian, with more than 2,000 poor peasant men and women attending) made it relatively easy to mobilize the poor peasant stratum to serve as the backbone of the land reform review. The focus of the poor peasant meeting was to enlighten the class consciousness of the masses and clarify the direction of the review by using the method of comparison. Their slogans were "Compare and think, see if the landlords are stronger than us" and "Think and compare, see if our liberation is thorough." After the poor peasants compared and settled accounts at the meeting, most of them believed that now "the poor are still poor, and the landlords are still rich." Therefore, they immediately launched a grievance session, and many poor peasants cried bitterly while accusing the landlords, believing that their holes had not been filled, and the land left by the landlords was still good and plentiful. Poor peasants in the fourth district of Fanxian said: The landlord harvested 20 large cloth bags of wheat this year, but the poor peasants did not harvest enough wheat to eat. Therefore, everyone unanimously believed that the review must be resolutely and thoroughly carried out. In the grievance and comparison of suffering, the poor peasants also examined why the land reform in the past was not thorough, because the poor peasants did not run the household in the village. Men Shouhe, a poor peasant in Yanggu, said: "We don't run the household, we can't use our strength. Whatever the chairman says we are, we are. We are like mules pulling a mill, listening to orders." Wang Zhanshan, a poor peasant in Liucuntun, Dong'e, said: "I am very poor. In the past, when dividing the fruits, I reached out to count a share, and the price was divided equally. It was not even a little bit, and in total, it was not enough to delay the wages! After the meeting, I still couldn't get rid of borrowing food and fuel, starving my stomach, saying that I wouldn't fall behind!" According to the urgent demand of the poor peasants to run the household, the leadership immediately supported the poor peasants, explaining that today is the world of the poor, and the poor are the masters of the house. Finally, everyone discussed that if the poor are to run the household, they must establish their own leading organization. Therefore, at the meeting, the poor peasants proposed that each village should carefully select their supported poor peasant representatives to form a review committee dominated by poor peasants (absorbing some middle peasant representatives to participate) to become the highest authority in the village to lead the peasant liberation review. At the poor peasant meeting of more than 2,000 people in Zhuxian, the poor peasants with high review enthusiasm also enthusiastically launched a self-reporting movement to contribute the hidden property of the landlords. The poor peasants in the forty-five villages also conducted a solemn oath to unite the middle peasants and completely eliminate the landlords. After these poor peasants returned to the village, they immediately carried out class division and class stratification in the village, strictly reviewed the components, and established poor peasant groups. In order to better unite the middle peasants, the poor peasant group members, in addition to their own separate organization, also dispersed to participate in the peasant association groups, becoming the core of the peasant association groups. The village review committee, based on the opinions of these poor peasant groups, thoroughly reviewed and approved the existing village cadres. Those village cadres who actively led the liberation were still allowed to participate in the village review committee, and the shortcomings of the middle and poor rural cadres who were used by the landlords and were corrupt were pointed out, and they were ordered to correct them. They were still regarded as a family with the poor peasants. After being approved by the whole village, they could still participate in the village work after they were indeed transformed. After the village leadership was transformed, the review committee successfully led the land reform review struggle in the whole village. Some villages took the poor peasant party members of the branch as the core to collude and organize poor peasant groups, so that the party and the poor peasant groups were more closely integrated, and relied on the support of the poor peasant groups to transform the branch.
　　The establishment of the leadership of the poor peasants and the establishment of separate organizations often followed a bottom-up path in many areas. This includes two situations: First, in villages where work has been slightly developed, poor peasant organizations are established on the basis of existing village masses through "class alignment." In Liucuntun, Dong'e, in the in-depth class education facing the landlords by comparing pain and dividing classes, all members discussed: "Why are poor peasants active?" "Why are middle peasants not thorough?" Many poor peasants complained on the spot, full of unforgettable hatred for the landlords, fully exposing their determination to fight the landlords resolutely and eliminate them completely. Wang Yuxue, a middle peasant cadre, was also deeply moved, and frankly said on the spot: He is a middle peasant, he has no experience of the suffering of the poor, he does not mobilize the poor, and he does not listen to their opinions much. As for the landlords? But he felt pity, so the leadership review was not thorough. Today, he knows the suffering of the poor, and in the future, he must be ruthless to the landlords. Then everyone discussed that the landlords are the common enemies of the middle and poor peasants. It is not enough to be ruthless. In the future, only by following the poor peasants can the review be carried out thoroughly. Therefore, after dividing the classes, all members carried out class alignment, divided the poor peasant groups and became the leading backbone of the women's association, and established the "poor peasant backbone, middle peasant meat" review committee. Second, in villages where work has not been developed, generally the landlords' "lackeys" control the village administration. In these areas, they adopted in-depth visits to poor peasants, enlightened the most poor peasants, and developed and organized poor peasant groups, re-established peasant associations, and transformed the village leadership. The village cadres of Sanlizhuang, Shouyang, were all controlled by the landlords in the village. Later, after the director of the district women's rescue association arrived in the village, he immediately visited Li Dianchang and Chen Shao, the most prestigious poor peasants, enlightened their consciousness, and supported them, saying: Don't worry about doing it, if you do it crookedly, the leadership will help you up, and the leadership will make up for the holes. Li Chen then slowly moved among the poor peasants in the village, and then convened a general meeting of poor peasants in the village. The cadres supported them on the spot and said: From now on, all the work in the village will be done by us poor people! Do whatever you want. Under the leadership of the poor peasants, they launched a liquidation against the fifteen landlords in the village, transformed the peasant association and the regime, and the poor peasant Chen Shao was reassigned as an instructor, Ma Chunming was elected as the chairman of the peasant association, and Li Dianchang was elected as the village head. The "lackey" elements in the village cadres were purged. Zhouzhuang in the fifth district of Qingfeng was the most seriously ruled by landlords, and the situation has not been opened up several times in the past to mobilize the masses. After Comrade Wang Haode from the district arrived in the village this time, he immediately colluded among the poorest peasants and organized a turn-over group of poor peasant men and women. Under the leadership of the turn-over group, he united the middle peasants, reorganized the peasant association, and led the whole village to conduct a review struggle against four landlords. The new peasant association under the leadership of the poor peasant backbone has increased its members sharply to 74, becoming the strongest force in leading the review struggle in the village. The villages that were considered impossible to open up quickly became active in the review movement under the core leadership of the poor peasants.
　　When establishing the leading backbone of poor peasants and establishing separate organizations, it is necessary to firmly implement the policy of uniting with middle peasants. The experience of the review movement in Hebei-Shandong-Henan proves that there are two links to consolidate the unity of middle and poor peasants: One is to clearly draw the rural class facing the landlords and firmly implement the policy of eliminating the landlord class. The other is to clearly unite the middle peasants and unite the majority. In the review movement in Hebei-Shandong-Henan, the education of poor peasants running the household and uniting middle peasants was carried out in depth in the poor peasant meetings and poor peasant group meetings; in the middle peasant meetings, the education of middle peasants must follow the poor peasants and everyone will turn over was also carried out. Then, in the joint celebration meeting of middle and poor peasants, according to "whether there is exploitation" and "source of family property", the classes were clearly divided one by one, clarifying who should be fought and who should not be fought, and solemn oaths were held: the poor peasants said: "Never fight the middle peasants, the family will unite to fight the landlords." The middle peasants also said: "We must follow the poor peasants." The hearts of the middle peasants were put down, the goals of the poor peasants' leadership struggle were clarified, and everyone said excitedly: We are united, and we are not afraid of defeating the landlords!

　　“中不中问贫农”
  　冀鲁豫树立贫农核心领导的经过
    树立贫农核心领导的阶级路线，在冀鲁豫复查运动中，已被普遍运用。从六月下旬开始复查起，冀鲁豫在思想领导上就很明确的贯穿了这一群众路线。两个多月的运动中，他们一直是把贫农当成土改复查的基本动力，“中不中问贫农”的口号，已响遍各村，贫农的要求领导上都有意识的把它提高到党的政策的水平，并把它当作土改复查中的基本方向。至于联合中农的具体表现：他们是在把贫农意见集中为复查的主要方向时，同时就去征求中农的意见，求得中农的同意和同情。这样就倾听了大多数群众的意见，团结了大多数。
    为了更好的启发贫农觉悟，集中贫农意见，实现贫农要求，使复查有坚实的组织保证，冀鲁豫在复查中又建立了单独的贫农领导组织（贫农小组）。冀鲁豫南乐、清丰、濮县、清西等县，这种贫农组织，已普遍建立起来。每个村都建立起贫农小组、贫农代表会，成为领导农民斗争的全权机关。朝城、观城、内黄等县，这种贫农领导组织，也部分建立起来，但名义不一：有的叫填平补齐委员会，有的叫翻身队，有的叫翻身委员会，有的叫复查委员会；寿张等地，又叫贫农先锋队。清丰又叫贫农检查组。
    复查开始时，在工作基础较好的地区作为贫农领导复查的主要组织形式，是普遍采用的贫农大会，或贫农代表会。这种大规模的贫农大会（筑先十四区四十五个村贫农大会，到会贫农男女达两千余人），比较容易发动贫农层去作为土改复查的骨干，贫农大会上，中心是用比一比的方法，去启发群众的阶级觉悟，明确复查方向。他们的口号是“比一比，想一想，看看地主比咱强不强”，“想一想，比一比，看咱翻身彻底不彻底”。贫农在大会上对比清算之后，大部认为现在“穷人还是穷，地主还是富”于是当场展开了诉苦，许多贫农控诉得痛哭流涕，认为自己窟窿没有填起来，地主留的地还是好而多。范县四区贫农说：地主今年收麦二十大布袋，贫农收麦却不够吃，因此，大家都一致认为：必须坚决深入复查。在诉苦比苦中，贫农又检讨出过去土改所以不彻底，是由于过去贫农在村里没有当家。阳谷贫农门守和说：“咱们不当家，咱是有劲使不上，人家会长说咱是啥就是啥，咱是磨道的骡听喝。东阿柳村屯贫农王占山说：“我很穷，过去分果实伸手算一份，打价平分，不一点，总起来还不够耽误工钱哩！开完会还脱不了借吃借烧，饿着肚子，说啥不落后呀！”领导上根据贫农当家的迫切要求，当场给贫农撑腰，说明今天就是穷人的天下，穷人就是当家人。最后大家又讨论穷人要当家，必须建立自己领导的组织，因此大会上贫农纷纷提议，各村应慎重选出自己拥护的贫农代表，成立以贫农为主的复查委员会（吸收一部中农代表参加），成为村里领导农民翻身复查的最高权力机关。筑先两千余人的贫农大会上，复查情绪高涨的贫农，并热烈的掀起了献出地主隐藏财物的自报立功运动。四十五村贫农，并进行了团结中农彻底消灭地主的庄严宣誓。这些贫农回村后，即在村里进行划阶级划阶层，严格审查成份，成立贫农小组，有些村为了更好的团结中农，贫农小组组员，除自己单独组织外，又分散参加到农会小组中去，成为农会小组的核心，村复查委员会，以这些贫农小组的意见为主，彻底审查批准了现有村干，对积极领导翻身的村干仍然参加村的复查委员会，对被地主利用而贪污腐化的中贫农村干，提出其缺点，令其改正，仍与贫农是一家，以后经过全村群众批准，认为确实转变后，仍然可以参加村的工作，改造了村的领导后，复查委员会便胜利的领导了全村的土改复查斗争。有的村是以支部贫农党员为核心，去串通组织贫农小组，使党与贫农小组更密切的结合起来，并依靠贫农小组的支持，去改造支部。
    贫农领导权的树立与贫农单独组织的建立，很多地区又是经过自下而上的道路。这里包括着两种情况：第一、在工作稍开展的村庄，贫农组织是在现有村群众基础上经过“阶级站队”而成立起来。东阿柳村屯农会员，在比痛苦划阶级面向地主的深入阶级教育中，全体会员讨论了：“贫农为了积极？”“中农为啥不彻底？”当场许多贫农诉了苦，充满了对地主永远不能忘怀的仇恨，充分暴露出坚决和地主斗争，彻底消灭地主的决心，中农村干王雨学也深为感动，当场坦白的说：自己是中农，穷人的苦难自己没经验到，对穷人不发动，不大听取他们的意见，对地主呢？却觉得可怜，所以领导复查不彻底，今天知道穷人苦，今后一定要对地主狠。接着大家讨论了地主是中贫农的共同敌人，光狠还不行，今后只有跟贫农走，复查才能进行得彻底，于是全体会员在划阶层之后就进行了阶级站队，划分了贫农小组成为农妇会的领导骨干，成立了“贫农骨干中农肉”的复查委员会。第二、在工作没有什么开展的村庄，一般都是地主“狗腿”掌握村政，这些地区，他们是采取深入访问贫苦农民，启发最贫苦农民觉悟而发展组织贫农小组，重新成立农会，改造村的领导权。寿张三里庄村干，全被村里地主把持着，以后区妇救会主任到村后，即深入访问贫农中最有威信的李殿昌、陈少三（贫农），启发他们的觉悟，并撑腰说：放心干罢，干歪了，领导上扶起上来，有了窟窿领导上给你补。李陈才慢慢在村里贫农中活动，接着便召开全村贫农大会，干部当场撑腰说：今后村里一切工作，都是咱们这伙穷人当家啦！该怎么办就怎么办罢。在贫农的领导下，向全村十五家地主开展了清算，改造了农会和政权，贫农陈少三改任指导员，马春明选为农会会长，李殿昌被选为村长，村干中的“狗腿”分子被清洗了出去。清丰五区的周庄，地主统治最严重，过去几次发动群众都没打开局面。此次区上王好德同志到村后，即在最穷苦的农民中串通，组织起贫农男女翻身组，在翻身组的领导下，团结了中农，重新组织了农会，领导全村向四户地主进行了复查斗争，贫农骨干领导下的新农会，会员骤增到七十四人，成为领导村内复查斗争最坚强的力量。过去认为打不开的村庄，在贫农的核心领导下，复查运动迅速活跃起来了。
    在树立贫农领导骨干与建立单独组织时，必须坚决执行联合中农的政策。冀鲁豫复查运动的经验证明：巩固中贫农的团结有两个环节：一是明确划清农村阶级面向地主，坚决执行消灭地主阶级的政策。一是明确联合中农，团结大多的政策。冀鲁豫复查运动中，各村在贫农会上，贫农小组会上，深入进行了贫农当家团结中农的教育；中农会上，又进行了中农必须跟着贫农走大家齐翻身的教育。接着就在中贫农联欢大会上，根据“有无剥削”“家业来源”，一个一个划清阶级，明确谁该斗，谁不该斗，并举行隆重宣誓：贫农说：“决不斗中农，一家人团结斗地主”。中农也说：“一定跟着贫农走”。中农的心放下了，贫农领导斗争的目标明确了，大家都很兴奋的说：合成一块了，还愁地主打不倒！
