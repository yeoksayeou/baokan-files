　　Gengle and Yuanqu Originally Claimed to be Advanced, Investigations Reveal Incompleteness
    Gengle's Poor and Hired Labor Reflect: Ten Poor Farmers Are Not Equal to One Landlord
    [Our Newspaper] To thoroughly understand the extent of land reform implementation and to clarify guiding ideology in preparation for the autumn review, the Research Office of the Taihang District Party Committee selected Gengle and Yuanqu villages in She County as typical examples for investigation. After three weeks of preliminary investigation, the main problems discovered are as follows: 1. Gengle and Yuanqu are both villages where land reform was conducted relatively well. Yuanqu even had successful experience in adjusting the relationship between cadres and the masses. However, feudalism has not been completely eliminated. In Gengle, landlords, feudal wealthy peasants occupy land equivalent to the level of middle peasants, but its quality and output exceed theirs. Looking at the average yield per mu, landlords: 1.2 shi; wealthy peasants and managing landlords: 1.3 shi; middle peasants: 1.1 shi; poor peasants: 1 shi. Looking at the average yield per capita: landlords: 2.8 shi; managing landlords: 3.7 shi; feudal wealthy peasants: 3.2 shi; middle peasants: 4 shi; while poor and hired laborers are only 2.6 shi. The hidden wealth of landlords has not been thoroughly unearthed. The landlord Yang Jingzhang still has two wives, servants attending him, and even employs long-term workers, eating white flour cakes with oil and requiring apples to aid digestion. Some landlords even infiltrated the village government, bribing cadres to protect themselves. The prestige of the landlords has not been truly crushed. In Yuanqu, after three reviews around July this year, 29 landlords who had disguised themselves since the War of Resistance were discovered (only eight were struggled against last year), and 42 feudal wealthy peasants (only 30 were struggled against last year). These landlords and wealthy peasants had not been struggled against. 2. Unfair distribution of fruits of victory. The masses in Gengle generally reflected: "The distribution of fruits of victory in our village is not leveling and supplementing, but like Qingming festival (adding dirt to the graves)." An investigation of 88 households in Qianjie Xiang found that middle peasants received 42 percent of the third distribution of fruits of victory. Lower-middle peasant families in Yuanqu received less fruits of victory. Lower-middle peasant Jiao Yuansheng had five family members, 5.5 mu of land, and 5 mu were bad land, living in two dilapidated rooms. He was very active during the movement, but after the distribution of fruits of victory, he became inactive. Lower-middle peasants account for 17 percent of the population, and their reflection is: "We can't catch up at either end." In addition, both villages still have a considerable amount of undistributed public property and fruits of victory that were invested in cooperatives without the consent of the masses. Gengle took 300,000 yuan from the fruits of victory for village production expenses and 200,000 yuan for militia construction expenses. No one managed it well, and 120,000 yuan has already been used. These issues are of concern to the masses, but have not been truly resolved. 3. The poor and hired laborers have not been able to take charge, and the masses have not been fully mobilized. The reflection of the poor and hired laborers in Gengle is: "Ten poor farmers are not equal to one landlord." They are not satisfied economically, and their political and ideological mobilization is even worse. Among the 62 poor farmers in the second and third streets, only 18 are active. The mobilization of the poor and hired laborers in Yuanqu is better, but all matters in the village are still decided by the cadres, and old middle peasants make up eight of the fifteen cadres. Poor and hired laborers do not hold power among the party members, and old middle peasants occupy a considerable number. Both villages have some unresolved problems in the relationship between cadres and the masses, and the Party and the masses.

    The Taihang District Party Committee attaches great importance to the above situation. In addition to continuing to organize forces to conduct in-depth research, it also calls on leaders at all levels to conduct in-depth investigations in a spirit of thorough self-criticism, and to study the roads and methods for solving problems, in order to welcome the autumn review movement.

　　更乐原曲向称先进  一经调查都不彻底
    更乐贫雇反映  十户贫农不如一户地主
    【本报讯】为透澈了解土地改革执行程度，以清醒领导思想为秋后复查作准备，太行区党委办公室调查室特选择涉县之更乐、原曲二村作典型，进行调查，经过三周的初步调查，发现的主要问题有以下几点：一、更乐、原曲均为土改进行较好的村子，原曲在调整干群关系上更曾有过较成功的经验，但封建均未彻底消灭；更乐的情况是地主封建富农占有相当于中农水平的土地，而其质量产量均超过之；从每亩地的平均产量看，地主：一石二斗；富农及经营地主：一石三斗；中农：一石一斗；贫农：一石。从人口的平均产量看：地主为二石八斗，经营地主为三石七斗，封建富农为三石二斗，中农为四石，而贫雇则仅二石六斗。地主的内货均未挖透：地主杨景章，至今仍是两个老婆，丫环侍候，还雇有长工，吃白面油糕还要苹果助消化。还有的地主钻进村政权，收买干部掩护自己。地主威风，并未真正打垮，原曲是经过今年七月前后三次复查，才查出抗战以来即化形隐蔽了的地主二十九户（去年只斗了八户），封建富农四十二户（去年只斗了三十户），这些地主富农均未斗争过。二、果实分配不公。更乐群众普遍反映：“咱村分果实不是填平补齐，而是清明上坟（填圪堆）”。前街巷八十八户调查，第三次分果实，中农分到的占百分之四十二。原曲下中农成份分的果实少，下中农焦元生五口人五亩半地，且有五亩是坏地，住两间破房，运动中很积极，分果实后，不积极了。下中农在人口中占百分之十七，他们的反映是：“两头赶不上”。另外这两村均存有不少未分配公产及未经群众同意即投入合作社的果实。更乐从果实中拿出三十万元做村生产经费，二十万作民兵建设费，没有人很好经营，已用十二万元，这些问题为群众所关心，但未得到真正解决。三、贫雇未能当家，群众发动不充分。更乐贫雇的反映是：“十户贫农不如一户地主”。经济上未能满足，政治上、思想上发动更差，二三街六十二个贫农中，积极的只有十八人。原曲贫雇发动较好，但村中一切问题，仍是干部当家，而干部十五人中，旧中农即有八人。党员中贫雇未当权，老中农占有相当的数量。在干部与群众、党与群众关系上，两村均存在着若干未解决的问题。
    太行区党委对以上情况，十分重视，除继续组织力量深入研究外，并号召各级领导以彻底的自我批评的精神，深入调查，并研究解决问题的道路与方法，以迎接秋后的复查运动。
