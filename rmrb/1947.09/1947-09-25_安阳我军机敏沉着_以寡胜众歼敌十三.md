    Our Army in Anyang, Resourceful and Calm, Achieves Victory with Few Against Many, Eliminating Thirteen Enemies
    [This newspaper, Anyang news] On the morning of August 27th, four squads of our stationed troops in Anyang, led by Company Commander Chen Yaoda and Deputy Political Instructor Shi Yan, were active in the Gecunpu area of the Fifth District. While resting in Gecunpu, Comrades Chen and Shi discovered troops advancing towards Gecunpu from the northeast of the village. Initially, they couldn't distinguish whether they were militia or enemies. When the troops approached within 30 to 40 meters, Comrades Chen and Shi shouted: "Stop! Which unit are you?!" The other side indeed stopped, and one person replied: "We are the Third Battalion, don't misunderstand, we are on the same side." Then he took off his hat and waved it in circles several times. They said, "Which unit are you from?" Comrades Chen and Shi, having already determined that the opposite side was the enemy, casually replied: "We are the Eighth Battalion," also taking off their hats and waving them in circles, shouting: "Send someone over for contact." The enemy indeed sent one person over, stopping just across a small ditch from Comrades Chen and Shi, holding a rifle. At this time, Company Commander Chen noticed another group approaching from the east of the village and shouted loudly: "You are also not allowed to move, stay where you are!" The enemy obediently stopped advancing. Then, one of our soldiers said from behind: "Report, Company Commander, there are also troops coming from the west!" The company commander said: "Tell Du Guoshun's militia to make contact!" The enemy standing across the ditch, upon hearing the word "militia," immediately and loudly chambered their rifles. The calm Deputy Political Instructor Shi Yan loudly threatened: "Damn it, who are you shooting at? You'll be responsible if you shoot the wrong person!" The intimidated enemy was completely confused and quickly ejected the bullets. Later, Du Guoshun's militia ran into the enemy coming from the west and a fight broke out. Comrades Chen and Shi, taking advantage of the enemy's confusion, quickly retreated to the rear and said to the prepared soldiers: "Open fire!" Thereupon, machine guns and small cannons simultaneously fired at the enemy. The unprepared enemy shouted in confusion: "Don't misunderstand!" As a result, six enemies were killed in confusion, and seven enemies were wounded in confusion. We used three shells and more than eighty bullets and withdrew from the enemy's encirclement without any casualties.

    安阳我军机敏沉着
    以寡胜众歼敌十三
    【本报安阳讯】八月二十七日上午，我驻安阳××部队四个班，由连长陈耀达、副政指石岩二同志率领，到五区葛村铺一带活动。在葛村铺休息时，陈连长、石副政指发现村东北有部队向葛村铺前进，开始他们看不清是民兵还是敌人，等该部队逐渐接近到三四十米达时，陈、石二同志喊道：“站住！那一部份？！”对方果然站住，一个人回答说：“我们是三大队，自己人不要发生误会。”接着就摘下帽子在空中转了几个圈，他们说：“你们是那一部份？”陈、石同志已看出对面就是敌人，就随口答道：“我们是八大队”，也摘下帽子转了几个圈，喊道：“你们过来一个取联系。”敌人果然过来一个，离陈、石同志只隔一道小渠就站住了，敌人手里提着一支步枪。这时陈连长发现村东也来了一股，就大声喊道：“你们也不准动，原地停止！”敌人也服服贴贴地停止前进了。接着咱们有个战士在后面说：“报告连长，西面也来了队伍！”连长说：“叫杜国顺的民兵去联络！”站在渠沟对面的敌人听说民兵，马上哗的一声把子弹推上枪膛。沉着的石副政指高声威吓道：“妈的×，你打谁？打错了你们负责！”被吓唬昏了的敌人简直弄不清是怎么回事，又赶紧把子弹退出来。后来杜国顺的民兵和西面来的敌人走碰了头打起来，陈、石二同志趁敌人莫明其妙的时候向后面一闪，对已经准备好的战士说：“开火！”于是机步枪小炮一齐向敌射击，毫无准备的敌人一阵混乱的喊叫：“不要发生误会！”于是六个敌人糊里糊涂送了死，七个敌人糊里糊涂负了伤，消耗了我们三发炮弹，八十多发子弹，毫无损伤地撤出敌人的包围。
