Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 31st -- Washington Dispatch: The Weidemaier statement reveals the helpless despair of the American big bourgeoisie regarding the situation in China, which has accumulated over the years to the point of inevitable eruption. Weidemaier's statement merely served as a fuse. Based on America's market in China, and for Chiang Kai-shek to act as a watchdog in the Far East to suppress the people of the Far East, the ideal Chiang Kai-shek they demand should be a Western-style, "efficient" and "high-performing" standard American-style lackey. He should definitely not be a purely Eastern-style lackey like Li Hongzhang, who is antiquated, "muddle-headed and incompetent," and "disreputable." These two demands created a great contradiction, but Chiang Kai-shek is the only person America can find in China and must support to the end; otherwise, the angry tide of the Chinese people will collapse this corrupt rule. The American big bourgeoisie is thus caught in an annoying sandwich.
　　The Washington Post, close to the most conservative State Department faction, wrote: "The Chinese government's indifference, defeatism, selfishness, incompetence, and corruption have prevented China from achieving the peace or economic recovery its people desire. Assuming that General Weidemaier's criticism can drive the wheels of reform after General Marshall's failure is too naive. America's hands-off policy is a smart move. In recent months, government authorities have been under increasing pressure to change their China policy and give more assistance to the Nanjing government, but Wei's statement did not confirm any such changes." Here, the most conservative bourgeois wing in the United States has proposed a new line: that is, to treat Chiang Kai-shek like a son of a bitch, keeping him from starving but never satisfying him; this is called "hands-off." Then where is the other hand "let go"? Answer: Japan.
　　However, some disagree with this view. For example, the New York Times, which wrote: "Weidemaier emphasized the necessity of a thorough government reorganization, and Chiang has sufficient staff and authority to implement this reform. At the same time, the advice and statements of American friends can carry special weight, as Chiang may recognize their wisdom. It is not yet possible to hope for full American support in his struggle with the Communists and other Chinese parties—at least not until the government refuses to carry out the radical political and economic reforms necessary for the general welfare of the Chinese people, will it be unable to obtain American aid." As a mouthpiece of the Democratic Party, and singing the same tune as Chiang Kai-shek, the New York Times is cheering on the Eastern-style lackey. They are telling them: "Don't panic, it's a double act, don't you understand? Hurry up and act."
　　However, some use even stronger tones to emphasize the uselessness of Eastern-style lackeys, thus urging the United States to prepare for a backup plan sooner. This is the Republican New York Herald Tribune: "Wei's statement has two implications: one, the current government is corrupt and incompetent, lacking the trust of the people, and therefore its strength is extremely weak; two, the Communists will win China unless they must face the resistance of a government that is honest, capable, and truly concerned about the welfare of the people." But this is wishful thinking, because "the selfish interests of the people around the Chairman require the continuation of a corrupt government. And they are indeed hindering reform." "Any amount of American aid that Congress might pass would not be enough." If "the Chiang regime is maintained indefinitely, it will require millions upon millions of dollars." What to do then? "The possible consequences are depressing: either the CCP conquers China...or the area south of the Yellow River splits into several warlord and local ruling areas, and the Communists defeat them one by one." "If the Nanjing government seems determined to commit suicide and is successful, the United States must prepare to deal with future misfortunes." "The hope that reforms within the Chiang government and the Chairman's army could conquer the CCP may still be nonexistent, but this hope seems to be dimming day by day." This argument seems very intense, but fundamentally, "hope" still lies with Chiang Kai-shek.
　　Others, scolding and urging at the same time, include a curious inquiry: "China is on the path of decline. General Weidemaier's statement indicates that the Chinese government must promote reform through a radical change." The Washington Star also said: "Any degree of assistance to China undoubtedly depends on China's response to Weidemaier's accusations. In fact, Congress will not criticize giving China any substantial amount of assistance until the Chinese National Government fails to rectify itself." Note that the words "substantial amount" have loopholes. But the most honest seems to be the Christian Science Monitor: "Weidemaier's statement did not close the door on American aid to Chiang against communism. At the same time, it urged the United States to demand that Chinese leaders eliminate a certain department and engage in attacks targeting communist elements in order to obtain assistance." The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette said: "It is not easy to help those who help themselves, let alone support a corrupt and incompetent government in resisting communism." Especially in a "world of turmoil"?
　　But in any case, the Chiang government is still a son. The Connecticut Hartford Courant said: "This is a terrible truth, like Americans, all those who oppose communism are not perfect. The current Chinese government is a good example. China is as far from a democratic system as it is from peace.

　　对中国态势显示绝望情绪
  　美报怨蒋不是得力奴才
    纽约先驱论坛报承认中共将赢得战争
    【新华社陕北三十一日电】华盛顿讯：魏德迈声明显示着美国大资产阶级对中国态势的无可奈何的绝望情绪，经岁月积累而到了非爆发不可的地步。魏德迈的声明不过是起了导火线作用而已。美大资产阶级凭着美国在中国的市场，为着蒋介石必须在远东能起镇压远东人民的警犬作用，因而所要求的理想的蒋介石，应是一个西方式的，能讲究“工作效率”与“工作成绩”的标准花旗式奴才，而绝不应是再象李鸿章一流食古不化、“颟顸无能”、“声名狼籍”的纯粹东方式的奴才。这两个要求起了大矛盾，而蒋介石又是美国在中国所能找到，而且必须支持到最后的人选，否则中国人民的愤怒的浪潮将一卷而打坍这腐朽统治。美国大资产阶级因此陷入可恼的夹心板中。
    接近最保守的国务院一系的华盛顿邮报写道：“中国政府方面之漠不关心，失败主义，自私无能与贪污，已阻止中国获得其人民所渴望之和平或经济复兴。假定认为继马歇尔将军失败之后，魏德迈将军之批评可以推动改革车轮，未免过于难信。美国放手政策乃系聪明之举。最近数月以来，政府当局曾经遭受日益增加之压力，使其变更对华政策而对南京政府给予更多之帮助，而魏氏声明则并未对任何此种变更予以证实。”这里，美国最保守的资产阶级一翼，已提出了一条新的路线；即是对蒋介石只好当狗日办，给他饿不死，喂不饱，但必须拖着；这谓之“放手”。然后另一只手“放”在那里呢？答复：日本。
    然而也有不同意这见解的。比如纽约时报，他写道：“魏德迈强调政府彻底改组之必要，蒋氏乃具有充分幕僚及权威可以实现此次改革者。此同时亦系美国友人之忠告及陈述，能具有特殊之重量，盖蒋氏可能认识彼等之智慧也。还现在不能希望在其与共党及其他中国党派之斗争中获得全面之美国支持——至少在政府拒绝进行中国人民一般福利所必须之猛烈的政治及经济改革之时，将无法获得美国之援助”。作为民主党的机关报，而又与蒋介石同一鼻孔出气的纽约时报，是给东方式奴才打气的。他告诉他们说：“不要慌，演的是双簧哩，你还看不懂，赶快做戏罢。”
    然而也有用更强烈语调来强调东方式奴才之没有用，因而叫美国好早点预备后手的。这就是共和党的纽约先驱论坛报：“魏氏之声明含义有二：一，现行政府贪污无能，缺乏人民信任，因之其力量极为单薄；二，共党将赢得中国，除非彼等必须面对正直与能干及真正关心人民福利的政府之反抗。”但这是空想，因为“委员长左右人物之自私利益，需要贪污政府之继续。而彼等确都阻挠改革。”“美国会所可能通过的任何数量的美国援助均不足够。”倘若“无限期的维持蒋政权，则必需万万又万万的美元。”那怎办呢？“可能的后果是令人沮丧的，或则中共征服了中国…………或则黄河以南地区分裂为若干军阀和地方统治区域，而由共党一一各个击破”。“如果南京政府似乎仍然执意自杀而且有成效，美国就必须准备应付今后的各种不幸。”“对蒋政府实行改革，委员长的军队征服中共的希望，可能仍然没有，但是这种希望似乎一天一天的黯淡了。”这论调似乎很激烈了，但根本上，“希望”还是在蒋介石方面的。
    其他，一面骂一面催的，就有费力询问说：“中国走的是堕落之路。魏德迈将军之声明表示，中国政府必须以一次激烈之变革，以促进改良。”华盛顿明星报也说：“对中国任何种程度之援助，无疑胥视中国对魏德迈责难之反应而定。事实上，国会于中国国民政府未能自行整顿以前，决不批评予中国任何大量之援助。”注意，大量两个字是有漏洞的。但是最说老实话的，似是基督教科学箴言报：“魏德迈之声明并未关闭美国援蒋反共之门。同时促请美国要求中国领导者肃清某部，并从事对准共产主义之因素进击，以使获得援助。”毕兹堡邮报说：“援助自助者已属不易，如欲支持腐败与无能之政府从事反抗共产主义，诚属不可能。”何况在“世界动乱之际”呢？
    但是，不管怎样，蒋政府还是儿子。康提狄格州赫德福斯德新闻道：“此乃可怕之真理，如美国人一样，所有反对共产党者本身亦并非完美无瑕。目前之中国政府即一佳例。中国与民主制度相去之远，一如其与和平之距离。
