　　Anyang Village Technical Committee
  　Studies Seed Selection Techniques
    [This newspaper, Pingshun News] He Liansheng of Anyang Village, District Seven, did not select seeds last autumn. The millet he planted this year did not sprout, resulting in a "second planting." The masses said, "This year we must select seeds!" Labor hero Cui Fubao accepted the opinions of the masses and convened a technical committee on the night of the 28th of last month to discuss seed selection techniques: When selecting corn seeds, select them locally. Do not select from fertile land; select from ordinary land. The stalk should be green, the ear yellow, the seed rows straight, the seeds uniform, and the ear of medium size, with seeds from the middle part of the ear. Do not use seeds from either end, as the seeds at the tip are coarse, and the seeds at the base are thick. After harvesting, braid them and hang them in a ventilated place to prevent smoke from熏染; if smoked, they will become moldy. When selecting millet seeds, also select from the field. Do not select from fertile land; select from ordinary land. The stalk should be straight, the leaves green, and the millet ear yellow. This is called "bitter root millet," which is resistant to wind, drought, and waterlogging, and is not afraid of insect damage. It is best to cut them down and hang them in a ventilated place. If you want to thresh them, dry them in the sun and store them in earthenware jars. Do not put them in porcelain pots or foreign canisters, to prevent moisture. Select oats from the field, looking for yellow ears. After harvesting, thresh them by hand, dry them in the sun, and store them in earthenware jars, taking them out to dry from time to time. Barley is most afraid of frost; a frosted ear is green. Look for thoroughly yellowed ears, cut them down, thresh them by hand, dry them in the sun, let them cool thoroughly, and store them in earthenware jars. Select red beans from the middle of the plant, not from the top or bottom branches, as the top branches are shriveled, and the bottom branches are coarse. When selecting sweet potato seedlings, select from dead vines, as dead vines are coarse. Select round ones, not long ones, with sparse buds and deep indentations. Store them separately in a deep cellar. When selecting soybeans, choose standing plants, broom-shaped plants, not trailing plants, as trailing plants have dense leaves but sparse and shriveled pods. Thresh them, dry them in the sun, and store them in earthen jars, taking them out to dry from time to time. When selecting sorghum, choose ears that are uniform in thickness from top to bottom, with full, open-eyed seeds, not tightly packed seeds. (Cui Yue, Huai Zhen)
