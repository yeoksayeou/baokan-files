(This newspaper's Hebei-Shandong-Henan Province dispatch of the 3rd) Shou Zhang has achieved good results since establishing a leading backbone of poor peasants and breaking the deadlock in the review process. Establishing a leading backbone of poor peasants is carried out through steps such as resolutely authorizing poor peasants and establishing independent organizations of poor peasants. As early as the second review period in May of this year, due to the leadership being largely controlled by middle-peasant elements, there was a weak fighting will, blurred class boundaries, and unreasonable distribution of fruits. Some villages even saw poor peasants expressing: "It's better not to make trouble, but if we do, we must eradicate the roots," while middle peasants continued to spread negative sentiments: "We say it's almost enough, but the higher-ups always say it's not thorough. What should we do now that the wheat hasn't been weeded?" The leadership felt that if the poor peasants were not brought up to lead, the review could not continue. Therefore, some village cadres with middle-peasant backgrounds and passive work attitudes were transferred to the district for training, and a group of poor peasants, along with some middle peasants, were selected in the villages to form a review committee to carry out the work. Sure enough, the atmosphere changed, and the struggle was launched in a bold and decisive manner. However, because the entire poor peasant class was not mobilized, only a few people were selected from the poor to work, and they were ultimately isolated. Whenever anything happened, they always had to consult the middle peasants. Also, under the majority vote (because there were more middle peasants), the fruits were distributed according to the rich peasant line, and the poor peasants' emotions returned to depression. By March, the leadership felt that if they wanted to truly establish a leading backbone of poor peasants, they had to mobilize the entire poor peasant class, allow them to form a leadership core, and use their opinions as leadership principles. Therefore, they began with class division, cleaning up the farmers' association, washing away members and cadres who were landlords and rich peasants mixed in, forming poor peasants into separate groups, collectively called the leading backbone group of poor peasants, selecting cadres from among them, and giving them real leadership power. "Ask the poor peasants about everything." If all work is approved by the poor peasant group, it must be resolutely implemented. Even if someone raises objections, the leadership must overcome public opinion and boldly support them. Only in this way can the absolute advantage of the poor peasants be established. The issue of uniting middle peasants and transforming village cadres, which manifested as a tortuous internal struggle, was demonstrated in the establishment of the poor peasant backbone. On the unity of middle peasants, after the poor peasants came to power, they all held large meetings to express their attitude: "The poor peasants are the bones, the middle peasants are the flesh, and we must never fight among ourselves." All villages held separate meetings for the poor peasant groups and the middle peasant groups to check and discuss. Because there were more middle peasants, after several days of discussion, the middle peasants always used the excuse of emphasizing that the method of filling in the gaps was not good, but rather that "equal distribution" was better. The poor peasants had no choice but to speak frankly, have everyone examine their family assets, and settle the accounts face to face. Moreover, the middle peasants had previously received a larger share of the fruits of the struggle, and were embarrassed to say anything more at this time. Village cadres were identified according to their composition. If they were poor peasants, they remained the backbone of the new leadership group. If they were middle peasants, and were trusted by the poor peasants, they were also retained in leadership positions. However, some were pushed off the stage by the masses. Therefore, they were dissatisfied with the leading backbone of poor peasants. At this time, the leadership had to affirm the masses' right to choose their leaders, and at the same time express their concern for these old cadres. They conducted education in training classes, allowing them to return to leadership positions after transformation. Under the promotion of new activists, many were eventually re-supported by the masses.

### 农会成立贫农小组　放手培植贫农骨干　寿张发动贫雇层深入复查

　　农会成立贫农小组
  　放手培植贫农骨干
  　寿张发动贫雇层深入复查
    【本报冀鲁豫三日电】寿张自树立贫农领导骨干，打开复查僵局，已获良好成果。树立贫农领导骨干，系以坚决授权贫农，建立贫农单独组织等步骤进行。远在今年五月进行二次复查时期，曾因领导权多为中农分子所掌握，而产生斗争意志薄弱，阶级界线模糊，果实分配不合理现象，甚至有些村子贫农已表示：“不闹便罢，要闹就斩草除根”，而中农却仍在散布消极情绪：“我们说差不多，上头老说不彻底，现在麦还没锄，该怎办呀？”领导上感到如不叫贫农起来领导，便无法复查下去。于是把一些中农成份、工作消极的村干部调到区上受训，在村里选了一批贫农，并吸收部分中农参加，组织一个复查委员会，进行工作。果然风气为之一变，斗争是大刀阔斧搞开了。但因为没有发动整个贫农阶层，只是从穷人群中挑几个人干，毕竟势孤，遇事总得找中农请教。又在多数表决之下，（因中农人数多）果实按富农路线分配，贫农情绪复归消沉。至三月份，领导上才感到倘要真正树立贫农领导骨干，必须发动整个贫农阶层，让他们形成领导核心，并以其意见作为领导原则。所以便从划分阶级开始，清理农会，洗刷地主富农混进来的会员和干部，把贫农单独编成小组，总称贫农领导骨干集团，从中选拔干部，交给他们以领导实权。“一切工作问贫农”，一切工作若为贫农小组认可，便须坚决执行，即便有人提出反对意见，领导上也须排除众议，大胆撑腰。如此方才树立起贫农的绝对优势。在树立贫农骨干中，曾经表现为曲折的内部斗争的，便是团结中农和改造村干部问题。团结中农上，贫农一经上台之后，都曾开大会表明态度：“贫农骨头中农肉，绝不同室操戈。”各村均曾由贫农小组与中农小组分别开会检查讨论，因为中农人数多，讨论了几天，中农总是借口强调填平补齐的方法不好，还是“平均分配”。贫农只好打开窗子说亮话，大家摸摸家底，把帐当面一算。况且中农以前也都是多分了斗争果实的，这时也不好意思再说什么了。村干部则依其成份甄别，如系贫农仍为新的领导集团骨干，如系中农，而为贫农所信任者，也仍保存于领导岗位上，但也有一部分被群众推下台去，因此，对贫农领导骨干不满。这时领导上既要肯定群众有选择他们的领袖的权利，又要表示对这些老干部的爱护，便在训练班中进行教育，让他们于改造后仍可回到领导岗位来。在新的积极分子的推动之下，结果有许多是重新得到群众的拥护的。
