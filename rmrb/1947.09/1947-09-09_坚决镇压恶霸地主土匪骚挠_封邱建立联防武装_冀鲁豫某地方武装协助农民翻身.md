【Our Newspaper, JiluYu, 8th Dispatch】After the peasants in the newly recovered areas of Fengqiu County overturned their lives, they successively established joint defense armed forces to unite and protect their gains. Since the land reform began in the county on July 7th, within just half a month, more than two hundred and nineteen villages out of the county's three hundred villages had distributed wealth and grain, and the masses had achieved preliminary liberation. However, some un-eradicated bully landlords, in collusion with stubborn and miscellaneous small groups of bandits, frequently harassed and robbed the hard-won gains of the peasants. On August 4th, the county held a meeting of peasants who had overturned their lives. At the meeting, after enlightenment, the peasants poured out their grievances. At that time, the leadership immediately expressed its attitude to the masses, sharing life and death, explaining that to protect their gains and completely defeat the landlords, everyone had to take up steel guns and homemade cannons. As soon as the leadership issued the call, the masses responded enthusiastically, and demanded to swear to the heavens, uniting as one. After the cadres and masses solemnly swore an oath, the masses in ten villages returned to their villages and held meetings to mobilize and take up arms. In general, under the leadership of activists, villages took up arms one after another. In the process of automatic unity, the masses established small-area armed forces. They established rules for mutual assistance and cooperation, and their morale was unprecedentedly high.

【Our Newspaper, JiluYu, 5th Dispatch】The local armed forces of a certain area actively helped the masses to overturn their lives. In the tense combat environment of the border areas, they carried out land reform while fighting, organized work teams to enter the guerrilla areas, and established a disciplinary team to maintain troop discipline and guard the landlords. From July 1st to the 10th, within ten days, twenty-one villages around Guo Yiji in Yangwu were stirred up to struggle, ninety-seven landlords were liquidated, and the masses received a total of two thousand five hundred and eighty piculs of grain. In the second half of the month, all units participated. Within half a month, more than two thousand people in ninety-six villages distributed land and grain, liquidated one hundred and ninety-eight landlords, and obtained four thousand one hundred and eighty-six piculs of grain and three hundred and ninety-six head of livestock. Land reform behind enemy lines is proceeding smoothly and gaining preliminary experience: When entering a village, first find poor people to talk to individually, review the situation of the landlords, and then find stubborn puppet Ba長 (village chiefs) to check the land, as an introduction and reference for understanding the material; after the investigation is clear, arrest the landlords and ask them to admit their mistakes at mass meetings, stipulate agreements, and sign guarantees. At first, the masses had some concerns, but the work team firmly supported them and took the lead in leading the masses to move things. However, the method of distributing most things was simple, and orphans, widows, the elderly, and the young suffered losses and demanded more. In order to take care of this situation, a portion of the property was reserved before the distribution, but not by a large margin. Later, poor people's representatives were selected to distribute all the liquidated items together. Two peasant representatives were selected in Liuben Village, and they distributed things very fairly. In the evening, they reported two more landlords who had been omitted, and they were liquidated. Organizations have been established in each village, and the great movement is continuing.

    冀鲁豫某地方武装协助农民翻身
    【本报冀鲁豫八日电】封邱县新收腹区农民翻身后，纷纷建立联防武装，团结保卫果实。该县自七月七日开始土改，仅半月，全县三百余村，即有二百十九个村分财分粮，群众得到初步翻身。但某些未被肃清之恶霸地主，结合顽杂小股土匪，经常出扰，抢劫翻身农民的斗争果实。八月四日，全县召开翻身农民大会，会上经启发后，农民纷纷诉苦，当时领导上即向群众表示态度，同生死、共患难，说明要保住果实，彻底打垮地主，只有大家拿起钢枪土炮来。领导上一号召，群众即纷纷响应，并要求对天发誓，团结一条心。干群隆重宣誓后，十村群众回村纷纷开会，动员掌握了武器。一般的村庄，在积极分子带头之下，都先后拿起枪来。群众在自动联合中，建立了小区武装。定出规矩互助配合，情绪空前高涨。
    【本报冀鲁豫五日电】×区地方武装，积极帮助群众翻身，在边缘区紧张的战斗环境中，一面打仗，一面进行土地改革，组织了工作队，开入游击区，并成立纠察队，维持部队纪律和看管地主。从七月一号到十号十天中，在阳武郭义集周围，共掀起二十一个村庄的斗争，清算了九十七家地主，群众共得到粮食两千五百八十石。下半月全国各单位均参加，半月时间，九十六个村庄两万多群众分粮分地，清算了一百九十八个地主，分得粮食四千一百八十六石，牲口三百九十六个。敌后土改进行顺利并取得初步经验：进村先找穷人个别谈话，复查地主情形，再找顽伪保长查看地亩，作为了解材料的引证和参考；调查清楚后，就把地主扣起来，叫他在群众会上承认错误，规定约法，具结划押。起初群众稍有顾虑，但工作队坚决撑腰，并带头领着群众搬东西。但大部分东西的方式简单，孤寡老幼吃亏，要求多分。为了照顾这种情况，在分以前，留出一部分财物，但不悬殊很大，后来即选出穷人代表，把清算出来的东西一块分完。榴本村选出了两个农民代表，把东西分的很公平，晚上又报出遗漏的两家地主，作了清算，各村建立组织，大的运动在继续开展中。
