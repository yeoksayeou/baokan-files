Xinhua News Agency, Yu-Wan-Su, August 15th: (Delayed dispatch) Frontline reporters Li Xin and Zhuang Dong report: The situation when Liu Deng's southward advancing army crossed the 300-li-long east-west Longhai Railway line on August 11th is as follows: On August 11th, the army crossed the railway. All units, according to meticulous arrangements, braved artillery fire, enemy aircraft harassment, and muddy roads, and advanced courageously. Within two hours, they controlled more than 100 li of the railway, swept away more than 20 large and small strongholds, and wiped out Jiang's bandits in various places. A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army annihilated the entire 3rd Battalion of the 2nd Regiment of Henan Security in Jiunvji, Cao County, in ten minutes with a casual, opportunistic move. Another unit, after a long march overnight, captured and annihilated the Jiang's Police Brigade and over 650 people, including Wan Xiangchun, the Major General Deputy Division Commander of the former 127th Division of Ningling County, who were fleeing to Shangqiu, with swift and courageous action near Shangqiu. When the reporter accompanied a certain unit across the road at midnight, the stations on the road had become dead stations, with only the station lights emitting dim light, the mournful cries of one or two planes in the air, and the occasional firing of flares. The rest was the earth-shattering explosions of the People's Liberation Army's artillery fire. Most of the commanders and fighters had already stepped on this major artery of Jiang's civil war for the third time. Everyone unanimously recounted the victorious scenes of the previous two attacks on Longhai, excitedly talking about the hundredfold strength of the troops now, and the glorious task of fighting into the KMT-controlled areas. They were truly spirited, courageous a hundredfold, and full of a high degree of fighting will and confidence in victory. By dawn, the Longhai Railway was already behind the People's Liberation Army. The masses in the villages south of the road dug out the grain and firewood they had prepared for the southward PLA from their cellars to welcome their own army.

　　我军跨越陇海路时顺手牵羊歼敌千余
    【新华社豫皖苏八月十五日电】（迟到）前线记者黎辛、庄栋报导：刘邓南下大军八月十一日横跨东西三百里长的陇海线时之情况称：大军于八月十一日横过铁道，各部均按周密的布置，不顾炮火轰击、敌机骚扰及道路泞泥，英勇挺进。于两小时内即控制铁道一百余里，席卷大小据点廿余个，扫灭各地蒋匪。解放军某部，在曹县九女集以顺手牵羊之势，十分钟就歼灭河南保二团第三营全部。另一部在一夜长途行军之后，以勇猛迅速动作，在商邱附近俘歼蒋记交警大队及逃往商邱途中的宁陵县长前一二七师少将副师长万象春以下六百五十余人。当记者随某部于午夜过路时，路上的车站已经成了死站，只有站灯发出暗淡的火光，空中一、二架飞机的悲鸣，和照明弹不时的放射，其余便都是解放军的炮火震天动地的爆炸声。大部指战员们已是第三次踏上这蒋家内战的大动脉管，大家不约而同的叙说着前两次出击陇海的胜利情景，兴奋的说着现在部队的百倍强大，及打到蒋管区去的光荣任务，真个是精神振奋，勇气百倍，充满了高度的战斗意志和胜利信心。及至天明，陇海路已经落在人民解放军的后面，路南各村群众纷纷把地窖中挖出早为南下解放军预备好的粮食和柴草，来迎接自己的队伍。
