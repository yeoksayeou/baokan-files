　　Launch Self-Reporting Solidarity Campaign
  　Thoroughly Re-Examine and Accuse Landlords
    冀鲁豫 (Ji Lu Yu) Obtains New Experience in Eliminating "Air Raid Shelters"
    [Reported by this Newspaper] The ideological dedication, self-reporting for merit, celebration of merit, and solidarity accusation movement is a new creation in the deepening of the re-examination movement in the 冀鲁豫 (Ji Lu Yu) region.博平 (Bo Ping), 筑先 (Zhu Xian), 昆吾 (Kun Wu), 范县 (Fan Xian), 寿张 (Shou Zhang) and other counties have universally launched this movement in both new and old areas, propelling the re-examination movement into a new climax.
    博平 (Bo Ping) county's fourth re-examination uncovered a large amount of hidden wealth, but the leadership lacked a clear direction on how to deeply mobilize the masses and eliminate the landlords' "air raid shelters." Some district and village cadres and a few activists simply beat and interrogated landlords, and engaged in forced confessions of some of the masses which increased ideological concerns and panic among the masses. Some masses ran away after reporting the landlords' belongings. At that time, the director of the驾店 (Jia Dian) Farmers' Association even reflected on his compassion for the landlords in a mass meeting, and vowed to the masses to reform himself and perform meritorious service. He immediately reported the cotton and packages stored by the landlord's daughter. The leadership immediately called for self-reporting to be glorious, and seventeen Farmers' Association members immediately self-reported, making the atmosphere in the whole village unprecedentedly active. The county party committee discovered this budding innovation and realized that it was wrong to casually attack the masses who were "air raid shelters" in the past, and that it was necessary to start with the glory of self-reporting and the establishment of models to enlighten the masses' consciousness and implement ideological mobilization in order to eliminate the landlords. The new method was tested at a farmers' conference in the first district, and 142 people self-reported on the spot. When farmers self-reported, they naturally combined it with accusations against the landlords' conspiracies and frame-ups. The heated accusations distinguished between the enemy and ourselves, between middle and poor peasants, and between active peasants and unawakened peasants, making them more united. Therefore, the county party committee affirmed that "self-reporting, meritorious service, accusation, and solidarity" was a new way to deepen the re-examination and implement ideological education, and promoted self-reporting and meritorious service throughout the county. The practice of self-reporting for meritorious service at the active element conference of the sixth district (poor peasants accounted for 80 percent) was as follows: Divided into three stages: 1. Report merits, compete for merits, compare merits, and congratulate merits. 2. Self-reporting combined with accusations against landlords. 3. Middle and poor peasants poured out their grievances and compared their suffering, and emerged as backbone elements of the liberated peasants. The spirit of "model complaint" ran through the entire process of the conference. (1) Do a good job of brewing. Before the meeting, cadres from the entire district went deep into each village and put forward the slogan "Self-reporting is meritorious service" and "Meritorious service is the most glorious" to start brewing. And consciously pay attention to promoting typical examples. There was a phenomenon of beating and forcing confessions in 侯楼 (Hou Lou) village. After the spirit of self-reporting was brewing among the masses, 侯德兴 (Hou Dexing) immediately reported the things of landlord 侯德吉 (Hou Deji) and accused him of his crimes. The village then commended and congratulated him, which led to seven more families self-reporting. (2) Hold a heated conference for reporting merits, competing for merits, comparing merits, and comparing ideas. Starting with "summarizing the struggle, reporting merits, and commending merits," the leadership first made a brief enlightenment: "Don't bury the night-shining pearls in the soil," and "Report all merits, big or small, as long as there are merits." After small group deliberation, a wave of reporting merits was set off at the conference.贾砦 (Jia Zhai) Farmers' Association cadre贾天平 (Jia Tianping) took the stage and shouted: "I mobilized the masses in my village, and more than 30 families self-reported. Landlord刘立海 (Liu Lihai) used 700 catties of wheat to buy me off, but I did not waver." At this time, reports were made at the conference and in small groups, and the reports became more and more enthusiastic. The stage was crowded, and after self-reporting, the conference turned from reporting merits to evaluating merits. First, small groups deliberated and commented on the advantages and disadvantages of each village and each person, and then turned to comparing merits and comparing ideas. As a result, 240 models were selected. Then began a mass celebration of merits, with gongs and drums, and flowers and firecrackers being set off. The leadership promptly summarized the evaluation and comparison of merits, called on everyone to learn from the model heroes, and exposed the landlords' distribution of things as the landlords' poisonous trick, and self-reporting as glorious. Then the small groups launched another round of deliberation, and then 70 more people self-reported. 3. Find classes in grievance, clarify the enemy and us, and recognize friends. While self-reporting, the masses also accused landlords. When they complained of injustice, the whole audience could not help but shed tears. A farmer in郭子口 (Guo Zi Kou) reported landlord郭兆观 (Guo Zhao Guan)'s grain package and then accused him: "郭兆观 (Guo Zhao Guan) bullied me so much that I couldn't breathe. Now he insists on putting things in my house so that the Farmers' Association doesn't treat me like a human being... Earlier, my child picked up a handful of his crops and was tied to a tree twice, beaten half to death with blood dripping. The landlord is so cruel." In the complaint, the masses enlightened the masses, and further went to each village to separate deliberation, and discuss door-to-door who the landlords were, so that even some cunning bankrupt landlords were nakedly checked out.贾砦 (Jia Zhai)'s bankrupt landlord贾月波 (Jia Yuebo) ate, drank, whored, gambled, and ruined his family. The result of the conference discussion was that he had exploited the poor and enjoyed happiness, and it was decided to go home and fight him. His third company was a poor peasant who had suffered for the landlord for many years and fought him for 600 catties of wheat. The result of the conference discussion was that it was not right to fight him. It was also proposed whether the middle peasants should be fought.苗立成 (Miao Licheng) of 侯楼 (Hou Lou) said: "The struggle against the middle peasants in our village was all provoked by the local侯伯 (Hou Bo) and 侯云 (Hou Yun). Today, we will release the detained middle peasants, admit our mistakes, and never fight the middle peasants again." 4. Compare suffering and emerge as backbone elements of the liberation. Complaining ran through every link of the conference. Poor and middle peasants competed to complain, and the middle and poor peasants compared their suffering. Poor peasant傅以会 (Fu Yihui) said: "I am forty years old this year, and I have been working for more than 20 years. I was forced to go to the outside of the关 (Guan) and returned to build a garden for the landlord. I ate cold cakes and drank cold water in腊月 (La Yue), and I got sick. The landlord's happiness depends on the blood and sweat of the poor peasants." The middle peasants said: "Although we have not suffered as much as the poor brothers, we have also been bullied. We resolutely follow the poor brothers to do it." The advanced poor peasants in 比苦 (Bi Ku) proposed: "Liberation depends on ourselves and everyone. We must seize the handle of the knife and do it!" Under this call and enlightenment, each village separated deliberation, formulated meritorious service plans, and emerged a large number of backbone elements. Self-reporting and meritorious service were widely launched, and the re-examination formed a new climax. According to a seven-day statistic, 20 percent of the more than 9,000 peasant households in the county dug out "air raid shelters." Forty-three of the 46 villages in the first district launched self-reporting and meritorious service. They reported 16,500 catties of grain, more than 2,500 bolts of cloth, more than 120 bolts of silk, 16 guns, and more than 1,000 bullets hidden by the landlords. (General Branch)

　　开展自报团结运动
  　深入复查控诉地主
    冀鲁豫消灭“防空洞”获新经验
    【本报讯】献思想自报立功、庆功、团结控诉运动，是冀鲁豫区复查运动深入一步的新创造。博平、筑先、昆吾、范县、寿张等县，新老区均普遍开展，推动复查运动进入新的高潮。
    博平全县第四次复查搞出大批浮财，但领导上对如何深入发动与消灭地主“防空洞”没有明确方向。产生区、村干部及少数积极分子对地主单纯吊打追问，对部分群众打击硬逼现象，增长了群众的思想顾虑及恐慌。有的群众报出地主东西后，便跑了。当时还驾店农会主任在群众会里反省出对地主有怜悯心，向群众宣誓改过立功。他当场将地主闺女存放的棉花、包袱报出。领导上当即号召自报光荣，有十七个农会会员当场自报，全村情绪空前活跃。县委发现这一萌芽创造，认识到过去随便打击当“防空洞”的群众是不对的，必须从自报光荣、立功表模着手，启发群众的自觉，贯澈思想发动，才能消灭地主。新方法在一区农民大会上试验结果，当场百四十二人自报。农民自报时很自然的结合了对地主阴谋陷害的控诉。从热烈控诉中分清了敌我、中贫农间、积极农民与未觉悟农民间，更加团结。于是县委肯定了“自报、立功、控诉、团结”是深入复查，贯澈思想教育的新道路，推广自报、立功，普及全县。六区积极分子大会（贫农占百分之八十）进行自报立功的做法是：分三个阶段：一、报功、争功、比功、贺功。二、自报、结合控诉地主。三、中、贫农诉苦、比苦，涌出翻身农民骨干。“表模诉苦”的精神，贯澈大会的整个过程。（一）做好酝酿工作。会前，全区干部分别深入各村，提出经验是：“自报就是立功”，“立功最光荣”的口号，展开酝酿。并有意识的注意发扬典型。侯楼村有吊打硬逼现象，当自报精神在群众中酝酿开后，立即有侯德兴报出地主侯德吉的东西，并控诉其罪恶，村里遂即表扬贺功，又引起七家自报。（二）开热烈的报功、争功、比功、比思想大会。由“总结斗争、报功、表功”开始，领导上先作简短启发：“不要把夜明珠埋在土里”，“大功小功有功就报”。经过小组酝酿，大会上掀起了报功热潮。贾砦农会干部贾天平上台大喊：“我在俺村发动群众，有三十多家自报的。地主刘立海用七百斤麦子收买，我不动摇。”这时大会上报，小组里报，越报越热烈，台上拥挤不透，自报之后大会由报功转向评功。先由小组酝酿，评论每一村每一人的优缺点，继之转向比功、比思想，结果选出模范二百四十人。接着开始群众性的大贺功，锣鼓喧天，献花鸣炮。领导上及时总结了评功、比功，号召大家向模范功臣学习，并揭发地主分散东西是地主的毒计，自报光荣。于是小组再次展开酝酿，接着又有七十个人自报。三、诉苦中找阶级，明确敌我，认清朋友。群众一面自报，一面控诉，诉到冤痛处，全场群众无不流泪。郭子口一个农民报出地主郭兆观的粮食包袱后，接着控诉道：“郭兆观欺负的俺喘不过气，现在又硬在俺家里放东西，让农会不把俺当人看……。早先，俺小孩拾他一把庄稼，两次绑在树上，血淋淋的打个半死，地主好狠心啊”。诉苦中，群众启发群众，进一步到各村分开酝酿，挨门挨户讨论谁是地主，这样连一些狡猾的破落地主也赤裸裸的检查出来。贾砦破落地主贾月波，吃喝嫖赌，家业败坏，大会讨论结果，认为他剥削过穷人，享过清福，决定回家斗他。其三连是个贫农，给地主受了很多年，斗了他六百斤麦子，大会讨论的结果，一致认为不该斗。又提出中农该不该斗，侯楼的苗立成说：“俺村斗争中农都是地方侯伯的、侯云挑拨的，今天咱把扣押的中农放出来，承认错误，以后再不斗中农。”四、苦比苦，涌出翻身骨干。诉苦贯串着大会每一环节。贫农中农争先诉苦，中贫农又比起苦来，贫农傅以会说：“我今年四十啦，扛了二十多年活，还被逼着下关外，回来就给地主修园子，腊月天吃冷饼，喝冷水，身上中了病，地主享福都是靠贫农的血汗啊”。中农说：“俺虽然没有穷兄弟受的罪大，可也受过气，俺坚决跟着贫农兄弟干”。比苦中先进的贫农提出：“翻身靠自己，也靠大家，要抓住刀把子干！”在这一号召与启发下，各村分开酝酿，订立功计划，涌出大批骨干。自报立功，广泛展开，复查形成新高潮。据七天统计，全县九千余户农民中，百分之二十自挖“防空洞”。一区四十六村有四十三村展开自报立功。报出隐蔽地主的粮食一万六千五百余斤，布二千五百余匹，绸子一百二十余匹，枪十六枝，子弹千余发。（总分社）
