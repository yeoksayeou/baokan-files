Comprehensive Model of the Public Health and Security Group

Li Jun, Yun Ying

I. "I am a Communist Party Member!"

The Public Health and Security Group (卫保群) is the militia captain of Dong Village. He joined the militia at the age of seventeen and is now twenty-two. The villagers comment on him like this:

"This young man takes the lead in everything. At home, he is like an unmarried girl, but when he goes to war, he is very brave."

The branch secretary and the chairman of the farmers' association praise him like this:

"Baoqun is truly a good Party member. When there is struggle and he is at home guarding the accused, we feel especially reassured. We don't need to tell him to go on a mission, he will definitely be effective. He is not afraid of dangerous things that others dare not go to. He is really our village's protector."

I asked him, "Why are you so active in all kinds of work?"

He said, "Comrade! I am a Communist Party member!" His answer was simple.

II. First Time Becoming a Model

Because of poverty, he did not attend school when he was young, and he deeply felt the pain of illiteracy. During the rectification period, he worked hard to learn culture, improve politically, and intensify his martial arts training. He got up the earliest every day, and soon learned more than 500 characters. Under his leading influence, the whole class had extremely high morale in learning, and the discussions were thorough. When practicing martial arts, his aiming posture was the most accurate, and he was not afraid of fatigue. At the end of the third training period, he was selected as an "A" grade model for the entire company.

III. "This is what I was awarded at that time!"

During the Henan-North campaign, he led a stretcher team to the front lines, following the county headquarters. He couldn't sleep all night, delivering letters and urging supplies at night, and helping the masses water gardens and dig land during the day. After the Anyang offensive began, he volunteered to lead a stretcher team to the front line with the combat troops. On the night of the decided assault, he personally went to the assault site to check the terrain, fearing that he would get lost at night, he looked at it six times in a row. He ran into enemy planes strafing, the enemy planes were only two room heights from the ground. He lay in the communication trench and raised his broken gun (which was homemade), replying with ten bullets in a row. The plane stuttered and flew away.

At ten o'clock at night, he led six stretchers, following the assault team, and rushed toward the attack target. As soon as they stepped onto the airfield, more than a dozen enemy machine guns on the bunkers swept at them like a gale. He calmly directed the stretcher team to lie down. As soon as the gunfire thinned slightly, he rushed forward again. The bullets hit the sorghum stalks on the stretcher beds, making a cracking sound. They did not panic at all and rushed straight to the bunker.

Our army's grenades hit the bunker, as if it were on fire. In this flashing light, he shouted, inspiring and rushing forward with the soldiers, while rescuing six wounded soldiers. At dawn, they safely carried the wounded to the rear. He looked at his body, covered in mud, and the gun bolt could no longer be pulled open. The wounded lying on the bed cheered, "You are really brave, really courageous."

After the battle, he was selected as an "A" grade model for the militia company. I asked him if he had won an award this time. He smiled and took off a white towel from his head, shook it with his hand and said, "This is what I was awarded at that time."

After returning from the expedition, he was in time for the rush planting after the rain. He put down his gun and actively led the militia to organize mutual aid for rush planting. He was invariably running around, creating a rush planting upsurge in the whole village, planting 727 mu in two days and catching 856 "big-eyed thieves" (a kind of pest that eats crops and looks like a mouse). At the village-wide summing-up meeting on rush planting, he was again selected as an "A" grade production model.

IV. "It's so refreshing to die!"

Being selected as a model three times in a year should be a remarkable thing, but he said, "Model or not, we have to do it anyway." He doesn't care about these things. What made him most happy was that he got a new Czech-style rifle on this expedition. In the past, he used a "local-made" rifle. After firing two rows of bullets, the barrel became too hot to fire. That made him most distressed. This Czech-style rifle, it doesn't matter if you fire three hundred or two hundred bullets, and the bullet makes two sounds when it leaves the muzzle, so he wipes the gun until it shines brightly. When he looked at his shadow in it, he tilted his head and said, "With this gun, I'm so refreshed to die!"

V. Determined to Make More Contributions

The troops have crossed the Yellow River. This news has long been passed into his ears. He kept asking when will they call me to leave? Next time, I want to join the assault team. If the superiors ask me to bring stretchers again, I won't go. He is determined to make greater contributions and strive to become a comprehensive model. "Take the hoe in peacetime, take the gun in wartime," this is his slogan. Now he is actively producing and practicing martial arts, planning to help all three militia groups to cooperate with each other. When they have free time, they practice aiming and shooting. Now thirty militiamen have only fifteen guns. He also plans to seize ten more rifles and one light machine gun to formally arm this militia platoon, capture ten prisoners, and resolutely strive for the glorious title of People's Hero.

    全面模范卫保群
    李均  云英
    一、“我是共产党员啊！”
    卫保群是董村的民兵队长，十七岁那年便参加了民兵，今年二十二岁了，村里人这样议论他：
    “这小伙子什么工作也干到头里，在家里象个未出嫁的大闺女，参战时可就勇敢啦。”
    支部书记农会主任是这样的称赞他：
    “保群真是个好党员，斗争的时候他在家看案犯，我们就格外放心，出发不用嘱咐准能起作用，别人不敢去的危险事，他不怕，真是俺村保驾的。”
    我问他：“你为什么各种工作都那么积极？”
    他说：“同志！我是共产党员啊！”他的答复很简单。
    二、第一次当了模范
    因为家贫，从小没上过学，深感到不识字的痛苦，在整训期间，他努力学习文化，提高政治，加紧练武，每天他起的最早，不久就学会了五百多字，在他带头影响下，全班学习情绪极高，讨论问题也彻底，练武的时候，他瞄准姿势最正确，不怕疲劳，在第三次受训期满时，被选为全连甲等模范。
    三、这个就是那会上奖给我的
    这次豫北战役，带领担架跟随县指挥部到了前方，他整夜不能睡觉，晚上送信催给养，白天还帮助群众浇园掘地。安阳攻击战开始后，他报奋勇带担架跟随战斗部队上火线，决定突击的那一夜，亲自到突击地点看地形，恐怕晚上迷失方向，一连看了六趟，赶上了敌机在扫射，敌机离地面只两房高，他伏在交通沟里，举起那破枪（是土造的），接连着回敬了十颗子弹，那飞机突突的飞跑了。
    夜晚十点钟，他率领六付担架，跟着突击队，向攻击目标冲上去了，刚走上飞机场，碉堡上敌人十多挺机枪，象刮风一样的朝着他们扫射，他沉着的指挥担柴队卧倒，枪声稍一稀疏，就又连忙向前冲锋，子弹头打得担架床上秫秸拍拍的响，他们没有丝毫恐慌，直冲到碉堡跟前。
    我军的手榴弹打在碉堡上，象着了火，他就在这火光闪灼中，一面杀声连天的喊着和战士一同冲锋，一面抢救下来六个负伤战士，黎明时他们把彩号安全的抬到后方，他看了看自己的身上尽是泥土，枪拴已经拉不开了，彩号躺在床上连声喝采：“你们的胆子真大，真勇敢。”
    战斗结束后，他被选为民兵中队甲等模范，我问他你这回得奖了吗？他笑迷迷的把头上一块白手巾拿下来，用手抖了抖说：“这个就是那会奖给我的。”
    出征回来以后，正赶上雨后抢种，他就放下枪，积极带领民兵组织互助抢种，他是无例外的跑前跑后，造成了全村抢种热潮，两天下种七二七亩。捉大眼贼（一种吃庄稼的害虫状如老鼠）八五六个。在全村总结抢种大会上又被选为甲等生产模范。
    四、“真痛快死啦！”
    一年之内选中三次模范，该是了不起的事，然而他说：“模范不模范，反正咱得干。”他是不计较这些的，使他最高兴的是这次出征得了一枝新捷克式步枪，过去他使着个“本地打”，推两排子弹，枪膛就热的不能再打了，最使他苦恼了，这个捷克式，打三百粒二百粒的没关系，而且子弹出枪口两个音，所以他把枪擦得明幌幌的，当照着他的影子时，他歪着头说：“有了这颗枪，我真痛快死啦！”
  五、决心再立功
    部队过黄河了，这消息早就传到他的耳朵里，他不断的打听，什么时才叫我出发呢：下次我要参加突击队，上级再叫我光带担架，我就不去了。他决心立更大的功、争取全面模范。平时拿锄，战时拿枪，这是他的口号，现在他正积极生产练武，计划把三组民兵全部互助起来，空间时候，演习瞄准射击。现在三十个民兵只有十五枝枪，他还计划再缴十枝步枪，一挺轻机枪，把这个民兵排正规化的武装起来，捉十个俘虏，坚决争取一个人民功臣的光荣称号。（冀南分社）
