(From Our Newspaper, Taiyue, 5th) The Taiyue Administrative Office has allocated 2,000 shi of wheat seeds as loans to the affected masses in Pingyao, Jiexiu, Lingshi, and other counties along the northern border of Taiyue. After the wheat harvest, Yan Xishan implemented the so-called "Chop Knife Policy" with more than two divisions of troops, carrying out a bloody massacre and large-scale plunder in the area. In Pingyao County alone, from June 23rd to July 27th, a total of 34 days, more than 60 people were beheaded, and 20,973 shi of wheat were looted (with two districts still uncounted), resulting in a vast depopulated zone. Now, for sowing wheat, the Taiyue Administrative Office, in addition to allocating some relief grain, has also loaned more than 2,000 shi of wheat seeds to help the masses in the area with emergency planting.

(From Our Newspaper, Taiyue, 5th) Tunliu has plowed 160,000 mu of wheat land and is continuing its efforts to eliminate wasteland, expand wheat fields, and strive to plow wheat fields twice. The county's experience in the previous stage was that in addition to promoting positive aspects, timely demonstrations, and awarding merits, it also conducted a comprehensive and in-depth inspection. For example, Comrade Li Yongfu of the County Production Committee, in two inspections at the original village base, discovered more than 100 mu of wasteland in the Liwangshan joint defense area and more than 200 mu of public wasteland in the Xucun Baiyunshan area. In the process of inspection, the public wasteland was further rationally allocated, and reward measures such as three years of no rent and three years of no burden were stipulated, rectifying mutual assistance and promoting this movement to eliminate wasteland.

　　太岳行署援助平介难胞
  　发贷麦种二千石
    屯留扩大麦地已犁十六万亩
    【本报太岳五日电】太岳行署拨麦种二千石，贷予岳北边沿地区之平遥，介休、灵石等县被难群众。上述三县麦收后，阎锡山以两个多师的兵力实行所谓“铡刀政策”，在该地区内进行血腥大屠杀，大肆掠夺，仅平遥县由六月二十三日至七月二十七日三十四天内，被铡死的群众六十余名，被抢去的麦子达二万零九百七十三石（尚有二区未统计在内），因此造成了广大的无人区。现将种麦，太岳行署除拨一部分救济粮外，又贷麦种二千余石，帮助该地群众抢种。
    【本报太岳五日电】屯留已犁出十六万亩麦地，现正继续努力消灭熟荒扩大麦田及争取犁二遍麦地。该县上阶段经验是除发扬积极面、及时示范、立功都除外，又作了普遍深入的检查，如县生产委员会李永福同志，在原村基点两次检查中，即发现离王山联防荒地百余亩，许村白云山公荒二百余亩。在检查过程中并进一步合理分配了公荒，规定三年不出租、三年不负担等奖励办法，整顿了互助，推动了这一消灭荒地运动。
