Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th. Cultural circles in Hong Kong and Shanghai unanimously condemn Chiang Kai-shek's destruction of cultural undertakings. The revived "Era Review" in Hong Kong stated: Chiang Kai-shek's strangulation of culture far surpasses that of the Qing Dynasty and the Northern Warlords Zhang Zongchang and Sun Chuanfang. In 1934, among the 900 newspapers nationwide, more than 670 were already under his control. After the "bitter victory" of the takeover, there are even fewer privately run newspapers. Even news agencies, radio stations, and film studios are controlled by him. Dozens of private radio stations in Shanghai were shut down at once. After the control of newspapers, the whole country is only allowed to use 500 to 1,000 tons of paper per month, but Shanghai alone needs 3,700 tons. Therefore, a large number of newspapers were strangled. Publications such as "Wen Qun" were banned before they were even published, causing a large number of publications to die in the womb. As for controlling printing factories, searching bookstores, and using large trucks to loot books and periodicals, oppressing vendors, and banning transportation and sales, such despicable methods are emerging one after another, making it impossible to see publications published in Shanghai in large cities such as Jinhua and Baoji. Novels such as "Iron Flood" and "The Rout" are all listed as banned books. Even deceased Russian writers such as Leo Tolstoy and Alexander Pushkin are regarded as leftists. All writers, scholars, and artists across the country who call for the restoration of the Political Consultative Conference line and protest against the atrocities of the U.S. military are regarded as "criminals." Therefore, the national publishing industry is on the verge of collapse, and even the Commercial Press is heavily in debt and unable to reprint huge works such as "Ciyuan" (a Chinese dictionary). Writers' lives are even more difficult, and their income is not even enough for a coolie. There are currently only about 20 professional writers in the country. The education sector is even more unspeakable, with the budget accounting for only 3.7% of the total national budget. The funding for the Zigong Vocational School in Sichuan is only equivalent to the salary of a senior clerk at the Central Bank. The monthly living allowance at Zhejiang University is only enough for one haircut, resulting in the tragic poisoning of the entire family of a professor at Zhongshan University from eating wild vegetables. A quarter of the students at Jinling University suffer from lung disease, and nine out of ten students in Chongqing are unhealthy. The entire education sector is filled with tragedy.

Chu Anping, a professor at Fudan University, commented in the "Observer" weekly on the banning of the Wenhui Daily, the United Daily, and the Xinmin Daily: "Because the three newspapers published news that the (Chiang) government regarded as taboo, but what they published were all facts, all things that the (Chiang) government did not want everyone to know. The (Chiang) government gives the right to publish news to the Central News Agency, but unfortunately, more and more people don't want to read the Central News Agency's news, and the more the (Chiang) government is afraid of the news published by the three newspapers, the more readers want to see it. The (Chiang) government can't prevent it, so it has to stop it. This is a Hitler-style approach."

The famous journalist Bing Yi wrote in the 19th issue of the "Guangming Bao Weekly" in Hong Kong, pointing out that Chiang Kai-shek's atrocities in destroying culture "are the trembling issued by a thief with a guilty conscience facing a collapsed fate." He then called on all news practitioners across the country, "Let all our journalists' pens unite and concentrate, to wipe out this group of culprits who are destroying China's private news undertakings, and create a democratic news undertaking that serves the people and speaks for the people!"

　　蒋摧残文化新闻事业
  　港沪文化界一致抨击
    【新华社陕北三十日电】港沪文化界一致抨击蒋贼摧残文化事业。港“时代评论”复刊号称：蒋介石扼杀文化已远胜于满清及北洋军阀张宗昌、孙传芳。民国二十三年时，全国九百家报纸中，已有六百七十余家为其统制，“惨胜”劫收后，民营报业更寥寥无几，甚至通讯社、广播电台、制片厂亦为其一手控制，上海民营广播电台一封即达几十家。新闻纸统制后全国每月只准用五百至一千吨，但上海一地即需三千七百吨。故大批报纸均被扼死。“文群”等刊物未出版即被禁售，致使大批刊物胎死腹中。至于统制印刷厂、搜查书店，以大卡车搬抢书刊，压迫摊贩，禁运禁售等卑鄙手段更层出不穷，使堂堂大城市如金华、宝鸡等地竟看不到上海出版的刊物。小说“铁流”“毁灭”等均列入禁书，连大托尔斯泰、普希金等已故俄国作家均被目为左倾。凡呼吁恢复政协路线、抗议美军暴行的全国作家、学者、艺人均被目为“罪人”。因此全国出版事业濒于崩溃，连商务印书馆亦负债垒垒，“辞源”等巨著无力再版。作家生活更苦，所得不抵一个苦工，全国职业作家现仅剩二十余人，教育事业则更不堪言喻，预算仅占全国总预算百分之三点七。四川自贡工专经费仅抵一个中央银行高级职员薪金，浙江大学每月生活补助费只够剃一次头，致发生中山大学教授全家吃野菜中毒惨剧，金陵大学学生四分之一患肺病，重庆全市学生十分之九不健康，整个教育界充满惨象。
    复大教授储安平于“观察”周刊评文汇、联合、新民三报被封称：“因为三报专刊（蒋）政府引为禁忌的新闻，可是他们所登的都是事实，都是（蒋）政府所不愿让大家知道的，（蒋）政府把新闻发表权统归中央社，无奈中央社的消息不要看的人愈来愈多，而三报所发新闻（蒋）政府愈顾忌，读者愈要看。（蒋）政府无法防止就只好制止，这是一种希特勒式的作风。”
    名记者并诒在香港“光明报周刊”十九期撰文指出蒋贼摧残文化暴行“是做贼心虚、面临崩溃命运而发出的战栗”；继即号召全国新闻从业员“让我们所有记者之笔都团结起来、集中起来，扫荡这一群摧残中国民间新闻事业的罪魁，创造为人民服务为人民说话的民主新闻事业！”
