　　Seriously Implement the Poor and Hired Peasant Line
  　Quwo's Fifth District: A Comparative Examination of Two Approaches
    [This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch dated 18th] On September 2nd, at a joint meeting of team leaders from base villages in Quwo's Fifth District, two different methods of implementing the poor and hired peasant line were discovered. One approach, represented by villages such as Shangchen, Fangcheng, Yangjiazhuang, and Xiaoqu Village, truly followed the poor and hired peasant line. They first cultivated poor and hired peasant backbone elements, and then used these backbone elements to unite and organize forces, forming the leading core of the entire village. There were two ways to unite with the middle peasants: (1) In villages that were just beginning to mobilize, the suffering of the poor and hired peasants led to the suffering of the middle peasants, so that the poor and middle peasants together poured out their grievances and fought together. (2) In villages that had already mobilized the masses, if the middle and poor peasants' understanding and struggle against the exploitation by landlords was not thorough, opinions often differed. The poor and hired peasants would repeatedly raise issues, discuss and study them with the middle peasants, until they broke through the middle peasants' thinking and implemented the poor and hired peasant line to thoroughly eliminate feudalism. Villages like this achieved a participation rate of 90% of the population in the struggle. The other method, represented by Yangdan and Qu Village Town, only went halfway on the poor and hired peasant line. In these villages, most of the poor and hired peasant activists had joined the militia when we withdrew from Quwo last year, followed the Eighth Route Army to fight guerrillas, or were arrested by landlords and imprisoned in the West Jail. They hated the landlords and were resolute in their struggle, demanding a thorough and complete fight; however, they believed that following the poor and hired peasant line only required them and their group. As a result, they did not unite with the middle peasants, or they forced the middle peasants to participate in the struggle. Although they struggled against one landlord after another, and most peasants received the fruits of the struggle, they were still not ideologically separated from the landlords, and there was still a phenomenon of protecting landlords. The leadership has already paid attention to educating the activists in these villages, letting them know that land reform is not simply about distributing land, but that attention must be paid to mobilizing the masses. As long as the masses are mobilized, there is no fear that feudalism cannot be eliminated.

　　认真贯澈贫雇路线
  　曲沃五区对照检查两种作法
    【本报太岳十八日电】九月二日，曲沃五区各基点村小组长联席会上，发现走贫雇路线的两种不同方法：一种是以上陈、方城、杨家庄、小曲村等村为代表，真正走贫雇路线的村庄，他们首先培养贫雇骨干，再以这些骨干去团结组织力量，形成全村的领导核心。团结中农的办法有两种：（一）刚开始发动的村庄，由苦大的贫雇诉苦带起中农诉苦，使中贫农一齐倒苦一齐斗争，（二）发动过群众的村庄，中贫农对地主剥削的认识及斗争是否彻底，意见常不一致，由贫雇一次一次的提出问题，和中农商量研究，直至打通中农思想，执行贫雇彻底消灭封建的路线。类似这种村庄作到了百分之九十的人口参加斗争。另一方法则以杨旦、曲村镇为代表的走了半截贫雇路线。这些村庄，贫雇积极分子大部分于去年我退出曲沃时参加了民兵，跟随八路军打游击的，或被地主逮捕而坐了西大狱的，他们对地主仇恨，斗争坚决，要求斗光斗彻底；但他们却将走贫雇路线认为只要他们这伙人就行了，于是不去团结中农，或强迫中农参加斗争，虽然将地主斗了一个又一个，多数农民也分得了斗争果实，但思想上仍未和地主分家，尚有包庇地主的现象。领导上已注意教育此种村庄的积极分子，让他们知道土地改革不单纯是分配土地，必须注意发动群众，只要将群众发动起来，不怕封建消灭不了。
