　　The historic feat of the People's Liberation Army launching a nationwide strategic counter-offensive has shaken China and foreign countries. Currently, the focus of the war is shifting to the vast areas of the Central Plains behind enemy lines, and the front line is being pushed to the Yangtze River basin on an unprecedented scale.

　　Since General Liu Bocheng and his troops began their southern expedition on August 7, they have advanced rapidly southward for more than a thousand li. They have now entered the Dabie Mountains area and are advancing towards eastern Hubei and northern Anhui. The left wing liberated Tongcheng and Lujiang on September 11, crossed Qianshan, and reached Wuwei on the 15th. The right wing also captured Xishui on the 11th. Since the start of the expedition, they have recovered and liberated 28 county towns in the Hubei, Henan, and Anhui areas south of the Longhai Railway. Wherever the army went, it was as if entering an uninhabited land, fully exposing the enemy's empty forces, chaotic deployment, and overall passivity in the heartland of the Jiang bandit territory. The Jiang-controlled areas south of the Yangtze River were in constant panic, and the bandit nest in Nanjing announced martial law. Chiang Kai-shek held military meetings overnight, and armored vehicles patrolled the Nanjing-Shanghai railway all night long.

　　The Chen, Xie, Han, Kong, and Qin troops, who crossed the Yellow River and operated in the western Henan area, have captured nine county towns and liberated vast areas since August 23. The western route captured Lingbao city on the Longhai Railway on September 12, annihilating the entire New First Brigade of the Seventy-sixth Division and the supplementary regiment of the 165th Brigade of the Thirty-sixth Division of the Jiang bandits. The remnants of the Jiang bandits fled to Xiangcheng, 40 kilometers east of Tongguan. The Liberation Army pursued them directly into the city and annihilated them all, and the city was liberated. On the same day, another large army of ours captured Lushi city, which controls the important passage of the three provinces of Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Henan, threatening Hu Zongnan's rear. Xi'an announced "preparation for street fighting." A group of party hacks and political scoundrels are moving their families to escape. The large army of the eastern route, heading south, entered Yiyang County on the 10th.

　　The large army of General Chen Yi and others, which went west out of the Jinpu Railway to operate in western Shandong, annihilated the entire Fifty-seventh Division of the Jiang bandits at Shatuji, east of Heze, on September 8, capturing its commander Duan Linmao and more than 8,000 men, and killing or wounding more than 2,000 others. The victory of the East China People's Liberation Army declared the final bankruptcy of the enemy's so-called "key offensive" in Shandong, and gave the enemy new blows with a more vigorous spirit of attack. This army, famous throughout the country, not only shattered the various myths of the Jiang bandit Central News Agency about the Shandong war situation, but also made the bandit leaders in Nanjing hold meetings overnight to discuss emergency countermeasures.

　　Just as Bai Chongxi was reporting at the Jiang bandit Fourth Plenary Session that the situation in northern Shaanxi was already in the so-called "mopping up," the large army of General Peng Dehuai suddenly appeared in Yongping Town, 75 kilometers northeast of Yan'an, with the speed of divine soldiers descending from the sky, completely cutting off the retreat of the main force of Hu bandit Zongnan's First Army and Twenty-ninth Army, seven brigades. These seven brigades of bandit troops had been crawling and rolling in a panic since their friendly army, the Thirty-sixth Division, was annihilated, but our Liberation Army was faster. They were surrounded in the Qingjian area of the Yan (an) Yu (lin) highway, and the seven entire brigades were trapped in our large encirclement, facing the same fate as the Thirty-sixth Division. General Wang Shitai's Guanzhong Liberation Army was also threatening the northwest of Xi'an. This brilliant move by the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia People's Liberation Army has put Hu bandit Zongnan in a dilemma, watching his subordinates being annihilated; and with the eastern section of the Longhai Railway sounding the alarm in the front, and the gateway to Qin and Yu being wide open in the rear, it is no wonder that he is raging like thunder in Xi'an, and forcing his subordinates to "bring their heads to see me" every day. In total, the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Liberation Army annihilated more than a thousand people this week and recovered ten county towns since the counter-offensive.

　　On the northern front, the Jin-Cha-Ji Liberation Army led by General Nie Rongzhen launched a large-scale attack on the enemy in the Ping-Tian-Bao triangle area, which the Jiang bandits said had been "completely cleared." On the 9th, they captured Xincheng Town north of the Daqing River in one fell swoop, annihilating an entire regiment of the Jiang bandit's Fifteenth Division and most of another regiment, and taking advantage of the victory to recover the neighboring Xiong County. They also captured more than a thousand Jiang bandit troops from the Ninety-fourth Division and other units. Another unit suddenly broke into Songlin Shop Station north of Gaobeidian on the Pinghan Railway on the 6th, cutting off traffic between Ping and Bao. According to an Associated Press report: "The situation around Baoding is serious, the city's coal supply has been cut off, and power generation has been stopped."

　　There is no war on the Northeast front. Since Chen Cheng took office, he has been running around everywhere, busy as a bee, fully reflecting his fear of the weight of the Democratic Allied Forces' next attack. (Xinhua News Agency)

### 解放军大反攻壮举震动中外巨大规模战线推向长江流域

　　解放军大反攻壮举震动中外巨大规模战线推向长江流域
    人民解放军发动全国性战略大反攻的历史壮举，震动中外。目前战事重心正移至敌后的中原辽阔地区，战线以空前巨大规模推向长江流域。
    刘伯承将军等所部大军自八月七日开始南征以来，已向南疾进千余华里，目前已进入大别山地区，正向鄂东、皖北进兵，左翼于九月十一日解放桐城、庐江，穿越潜山，十五日打到无为；右翼亦于十一日攻克浠水。至此，出师以来已在陇海路南之鄂豫皖地区收复与解放县城二十八座。大军所至，如入无人之境，充分暴露了蒋匪腹心地区兵力空虚，部署错乱，全盘被动。蒋管区的江南惶惶不可终日，匪巢南京宣布戒严，蒋介石连夜召开军事会议，京沪路彻夜铁甲车巡逻。
    南渡黄河纵横豫西地区之陈、谢、韩、孔、秦所部大军，自八月二十三日至今连克县城九座，并解放广大地区。西路于九月十二日克陇海路上灵宝城，聚歼蒋匪七十六师新一旅全部及三十六师一六五旅补充团，蒋匪残部逃窜潼关以东四十公里之乡城，解放军直追城内，将其全部歼灭，该城亦告解放。同日我另一支大军攻克扼晋陕豫三省要冲的卢氏城，威胁胡宗南后方，西安宣布“准备巷战”。一群党棍政痞正纷纷搬家逃命。东路南下大军，则于十日进驻伊阳县城。
    西出津浦路挺入鲁西作战的陈毅将军等所部大军，于九月八日在荷泽以东沙土集，一举歼灭蒋匪整五十七师，生擒其师长段霖茂以下八千余人，另毙伤其二千余人。华东人民解放军的胜利，宣告了敌人在山东的所谓“重点攻势”最后破产，并以更猛锐的攻击精神予敌人以新的打击。这一支驰誉全国的大军，不仅粉碎了蒋匪中央社关于山东战局的种种神话，而且已弄得南京匪首连夜开会急谋张罗应付了。
    正当白崇禧在蒋匪四中全会上报告陕北局面是已在所谓“扫荡中”的时候，彭德怀将军所部大军以神兵天降的神速动作，突然于十一日出现于延安东北七十五公里之永坪镇，将胡匪宗南主力之第一军及第二十九军七个旅退路完全遮断。这七个旅匪军自其友军三十六师被歼灭后即连爬带滚，仓惶南遁，可是我解放军比他更快，在延（安）榆（林）公路之清涧一带儿头一包，七个整旅已陷入我大包围中，面临着三十六师同样的命运；王世泰将军部关中解放军则又威胁西安西北。陕北人民解放军这一妙着，竟使胡匪宗南进退维谷，眼看其部下行将被歼；而陇海东段告警于前，秦豫门户洞开于后，无怪其在西安暴燥如雷，天天迫部下“提头来见我”了。总计本周内，陕北解放军歼灭千余人，并自反攻以来收复县城十座。
    北线聂荣臻将军等所部晋察冀解放军，在蒋匪说是已“全部肃清”的平津保三角地带大举袭敌，九日一举攻克大清河北之新城镇，歼灭蒋匪十五师一个整团及另一个团大部，并乘胜收复邻近之雄县城，又生俘蒋匪九十四师等部千余人。另部于六日突入平汉路高碑店以北之松林店车站，切断平保间交通。据美联社报导：“保定周围情势严重，该城煤之供给断绝，现已停止发电。”
    东北战线无战事，陈诚自到任以来，到处奔波，忙成一堆，充分反映其恐惧民主联军下一打击的重量。（新华社）
