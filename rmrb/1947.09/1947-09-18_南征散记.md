　　Random Notes from the Southern Expedition
    Wang Kuang
　　(I) Crossing the Yellow Flood Area
    August 17th, traveled eighty li.
    Starting from Hugangdian south of Dengguo, we entered the Yellow Flood Area after traveling fifty li. Villages were separated by the floodwaters like isolated islands. The sorghum only showed half of its ears, and the mud emitted a nauseating stench. To get from one village to another, we had to wade through five or six li of water before we could "land." Arm in arm, we treaded through the silt, wading through knee-deep murky water. Other personnel and vehicles advanced in rows and columns. The calm water surface was stirred up and bubbled noisily.
    The draft animals pulling the cannons were stuck in the mud. The artillerymen carried the ammunition boxes, the gun carriages, and the shells, slowly moving forward. The trucks wheezed and sputtered in the mud, moving forward in fits and starts. The drivers had to get out and crank the engine every few dozen steps. The soldiers escorting the large convoy and the masses pushed the carts, with rapid shouts from the cracking whips. The ground underfoot was so uneven. We advanced towards a small lamp lit by the forward哨 troops on a distant "island". Carelessly, someone would fall with a splash, covered in mud. The entire unit reached the other side at dawn. In the faint morning light, everyone looked at each other, covered in mud, and laughed wryly.
    August 18th, rested at Limiaozhuang in Xiangcheng.
    The terrain in this area is relatively high, but traces of flooding on the high walls were still visible. The Yellow River flood left an extremely terrifying impression in people's minds. In June of the 27th year of the Republic of China, the bandit Chiang Kai-shek breached the riverbanks at Huayuankou and Zhaokou in Zhongmu, unleashing the Yellow River flood that swallowed up the lives and property of 320,000 people. This blood debt is deeply buried in their hearts. An old man selling pears told me, "Who knows what will happen tomorrow? If it pleases the Chiang Kai-shek clan, they can breach the riverbank, and our whole family will be finished."
    The common people are extremely poor. One jin of wheat flour requires a trip to three or four villages to buy. Every family's cattle, sheep, and pigs sleep with people in dilapidated and damp huts. Most of the useful and edible items have been looted by bandits and stragglers. The People's Liberation Army guerrillas had been here in the spring and summer of this year, driving away the bandits for a time. They spoke with hopeful hearts about Commander Wei (i.e., Deputy Commander of the Yu-Wan-Su Military Region, Wei Fenglou), hoping he would come soon to stabilize the area.
　　(II) Overnight Stay at Qianzhuangying
    August 19th, traveled fifty li, crossed the Sha River to Qianzhuangying.
    Arriving at the encampment in the middle of the night, the villagers heard that the large army of the Eighth Route Army was heading south. They carried lanterns and led us to find housing, automatically boiling water and cooking, "Comrades, rest, you've worked hard." Greetings spread from the east end of the village to the west end. Before the brought livestock and saddles could be taken off, they were pulled into the villagers' mangers, munching on freshly added fodder.
    The family we stayed with consisted of a woman and her two children. The older one was named Zhang Shufeng, fifteen years old, and the younger one was only eight. The hostess was busy all day helping us cook and treated us very thoughtfully.
    "Where is your husband? Isn't he at home?" we asked her.
    "No……" she shook her head. "He was conscripted." Then she told us that her man had been conscripted seven years ago. He was working in the fields when the "Central Army" suddenly seized him. Seven or eight other people were also taken at the same time. When she prepared lunch and delivered it to the field, she only found his discarded hoe and a water jug. She fainted in the field several times. If it weren't for the two children in her arms, she would have sought death long ago.
    Mentioning the Chiang bandit army conscripting men, everyone felt resentful and fearful. A batch of seven or eight, then another batch of eight or nine. In a year or two, the Chiang bandit army had conscripted men four times. From the fifty or sixty households of Qianzhuangying, a total of more than forty people were taken away. Those who were taken away were like Zhang Shufeng's father, never to be seen again.
    The method of conscription was to suddenly surround the fields, villages, and intersections, then grab people one by one.
　　(III) Morning in Beixiangdian
    August 27th, traveled thirty-five li.
    Passing Sun Tiepu (between Guangshan and Luoshan) to Beixiangdian, we began to enter the original Central Plains Liberated Area.
    Along the way, we could see slogans painted and rewritten by the Chiang bandits. These slogans were written last year by the Central Plains New Fourth Army and the Eighth Route Army: "Resolutely implement the ceasefire order." They were painted over with "Suppress the traitorous bandits," "Implement the Political Consultative Conference resolutions" and "Capture the bandit leaders alive." Both sets of characters were clearly visible. Our propaganda teams used white ash to plaster them over again, writing on top: "The people of Hubei, Henan, and Anhui unite, overthrow Chiang Kai-shek."
    At seven o'clock in the morning, the shops on the street were still tightly closed. The signalman, Little Guo, wanted to buy batteries and gently knocked on the door of a general store, "Old fellow, please open the door. We are the People's Liberation Army. Don't be afraid." But there was no response. Little Guo shouted again, and someone spoke in a low voice inside. One person said in a low voice, "It's the northern soldiers." Another said, "Don't open it unless it's the Eighth Route Army." Little Guo was anxious: "Old fellow, old fellow, it's the Eighth Route Army! Come out and take a look." The owner peeked out through the crack in the door and exclaimed, "Ah……" The door opened, and the owner scolded us for not saying it was the Eighth Route Army sooner, "Is it the Eighth Route Army? They had a good reputation when they came last year," he shouted loudly like an old rooster, waking up the neighboring shops.
    The people on the street surrounded us, asking: "Comrades, where did you go last year?" An old woman selling zongzi said to me: "I feel like I recognize you."
　　(IV) Entering the Dabie Mountains
    September 2nd, traveled sixty li.
    Traveling southeast along the ridge of the Dabie Mountains, it has already been the fifth day. The mountains are covered with dense pine and cypress trees, and the air is refreshing. The terraced fields in the valleys and on the mountainsides are all golden with rice.
    Resting in Baiwan Town, an old woman affectionately brought a chair over, smiling and said, "When I first heard you were the Eighth Route Army, I was secretly happy in my heart. Later, I saw you passing by for seven days and seven nights. God knows how many people there really are! How happy I am! I'm not afraid to say that I like the Eighth Route Army."
    The villagers of Bali Zhou saw us carrying several large boxes and asked us if we were like the New Fourth Army, coming to perform plays, and asked us to come here to perform plays for two days after the war. A boss pointed to the newly written slogan and asked me: "What does 'the tiller owns his field' mean? Is it 'two-five rent reduction?'" When I told him that it meant dividing the land as before, he said repeatedly, "I understand, I understand!" It turned out that he was a person who had been given land. After the Red Army left, the land was taken back by the landlords as before. The most interesting thing was that the bosses asked us this time whether the "Red Army" was going to attack Hankou, and told us: "Comrades, it's only three hundred miles away, not very far."
    September 3rd, traveled thirty li, camped at Shawo.
    The people in the Shawo area are very familiar with the Eighth Route Army. Last year, the Eighth Route Army shed blood and fought here to defend this place.
    As soon as we entered the street, the people said: "The village chief hasn't come to the village for four or five days, so we know the poor people's army is coming." There is also a prophecy circulating among them: "The Eighth Route Army went south for the first time to drive away the Japanese. The Eighth Route Army will go south for the second time to drive away the Central Army."

　　南征散记
    王匡 　 （一）过黄汛区
    八月十七日，行程八十里。
    从邓郭以南的胡岗店出发，走五十里即进入黄泛区。村庄被大水分隔着象一个个的孤岛，高粱只露出半截穗子，泥水发出令人作呕的臭味，从这个村子到另一个村子，必须走上五六里的水程才能“登陆”。我们挽着臂膀，践着淤泥，涉过没膝的浑水，其他人马车辆成排成队的推进着，平静的水面，被搅的哗啦啦地沸腾起来了。
    拖炮的牲口陷在泥巴里了，炮兵们就互相抬着炮箱，背着炮架，抱着炮弹，慢慢地走着。汽车在泥水中呜呜地喘着气，半跛半颠地走着，车夫们几十步就得下来打一次火。护送大车队的战士们，群众在大车后面，推着车身，叱咤的鞭子急速地嚷喊着。脚底下是如此的凸凹不平，我们朝着前哨部队在远远的“小岛”上点着的一盏小灯前进。一不小心扑通一声就会滚得满身泥水，整个部队在黎明时分到达彼岸。在晨光曦微中，每个人互相看着满身泥浆而虚笑着。
    八月十八日，在项城的黎庙庄休息。
    这一带地势较高，但仍可见到高墙上为水所浸漫的痕迹。黄水在人们脑子里刻下极其恐怖的印象。民国二十七年六月蒋匪在花园口和中牟赵口决开河堤，一泻千里的黄水，吞没了三十二万人民的生命和财产，这笔血债，深深埋藏在他们的心里，一个卖梨的老头告诉我说：“谁知道明天会怎么样，只要姓蒋的喜欢，开个口子，咱全家老少就得完了”。
    老百性穷困不堪，一斤麦面要走三四个村庄才能买到，每家的牛、羊、猪都和人睡在破落潮湿的小屋里，能用能吃的东西大都给土匪和散兵游勇抢光了。人民解放军的游击队，今年春夏间曾到过这里，一度将土匪赶走；他们都以期望的心情谈论着魏司令（即豫皖苏副司令员魏凤楼），望他快来安定地面。
    （二）夜宿前庄营
    八月十九日，行五十里，过沙河到前庄营。
    半夜抵达宿营地，老乡们听说是八路军大军南下，都提着灯笼，引着我们看房子，自动的烧茶做饭，“同志歇歇，辛苦啦”。寒喧声从村的东头传到西头，带来的牲口马鞍还未解下来，就被拉到老乡们的马槽里吱喳吱喳的吃着新加的草料。
    我们住的一家老乡，只有一个妇女和她的两个孩子，大的叫张书风，十五岁，小的才八岁。主人家整天忙碌地帮我们做饭，招待的十分周到。
    “你掌柜的呢？不在家吗？”我们问她。
    “不………”她摇摇头。“他被抓壮丁抓走了。”接着他告诉我们她的男人已经被抓走七年了，他正在地里做活，“中央军”一下子就抓走了。同时被抓走的还有七、八个人。那时她做好了午饭送到地里时，只见到他丢下的一把锄头和一个水罐。她在地里昏迷了好几次，不是为了两个怀抱的孩子，早就要寻死了。
    提起蒋匪军抓丁。谁都愤恨与害怕。一批七八个，再一批又是八九个，一两年的光景，蒋匪军前后已经抓过四次了。五六十家的前庄营，一共抓走四十多人。抓的办法是突然将田野、村庄、路口包围起来，然后一个一个抓起来。被抓走的人都和张书风的父亲一样，再也不见回来。
    （三）北向店的早晨
    八月二十七日，行程三十五里。
    过孙铁铺（光山罗山间）到北向店，开始进入原来的中原解放区。
    沿途可以看到被蒋匪涂抹和改写的标语，这些标语是去年中原新四军和八路军所写的“坚决执行停战命令”，被涂上了“剿尽奸匪”，“实行政协决议”上面抹上了“活捉匪首”，两者字体清晰可见。我们的宣传都用白灰又把把它抹掉，在上面写上：“鄂豫皖的人民团结起来，打倒蒋介石”。
    早晨七点钟了，街上的铺子还紧闭着大门，通讯员小郭要买电池，轻轻在敲着一家杂货铺的门板，“老乡请开门，我们是人民解放军别害怕”。但是没有回声。小郭又喊了一回，里面有人低声说话了。一个人低声说：“是北方兵啦”。另一个说：“不要开，除非他是八路军”。小郭急了：“老乡，老乡，就是八路军呀！你出来瞧瞧”。老板从门缝里往外瞄了瞄“呀………”的一声，门开了，老板责备我们为什么不早说是八路军，“是八路军么？去年来过的好名誉”，他大声叫嚷象一只老公鸡一样，将邻近的店铺都喊开了。
    街上的人围绕着我们，问着：“同志，去年到那里去了？”还有一个卖粽子的老太婆对我说：“满熟的我象认的你。”
    （四）进入大别山
    九月二日，行程六十里。
    沿着大别山的背脊向东南行进，已经是第五天了。满山上松柏深密青葱气爽，川中和半山上的梯田尽是金黄色的稻子。
    在柏湾镇休息，一位老太太亲热的搬个椅子来，笑着说：“开头听说你们是八路军，我心里只偷偷欢喜，后来眼看看你们过了七天、七夜，老天爷哪真不知有多少人呀！我又是怎么样的欢喜，我要说我欢喜八路军，还怕个么事。”
    八里妯的老乡们，他们看见我们驮着几个大箱子，问我们是不是和新四军一样？是来演戏的，并且要求我们打完仗以后，一定要到这里来唱两天戏。还有一个老板指着新写的标语问我：“耕者有其田”是个么意思，是不是“二五减租？”当我告诉他，就是以前的分田地时，他连声说：“懂得懂得！”原来他是个分过田地的人，红军走后，土地又给地主照原样的拿回去了，最有意思的是老板们问我们这回“红军”是否兵打汉口，并且告诉我们说：“同志哥，只有三百多里路，没得好远。”
    九月三日行程三十里，沙窝宿营。
    沙窝一带的老百姓，对八路军很熟悉，去年为保卫这块地方，八路军曾在这里流过血打过仗。
    我们才进街，老百姓就说：“四五天不见乡保长来上甸，就知道穷人的军队要来了。”他们中间还流传着一个这样的预言：“八路军头回南下，赶走日本人，八路军二回南下，一定赶走中央军”。
