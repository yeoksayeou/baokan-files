    Early Frost, Early Planting
    Micro Township Masses Break Apathy, Wait, Haul Manure and Rush to Plant Wheat Overnight
    [This newspaper, Lu Cheng News] Previously, most cadres and masses in Micro Township, Second District, held onto the idea of planting wheat according to the solar terms: "Plant in the seventh month of the White Dew, plant in the eighth month, planting in the middle of White Dew is just right." Jia Anke said, "Now the masses are waiting for the soil to dry out, harrow it, and then plant leisurely. The land that has already been plowed is not being planted." Chang Zhaoqun said, "The brigade at the bridge has prepared more than 300 mu of land, but they are not planting, just waiting for the soil to dry out." To break the masses' apathetic and waiting mindset, the leadership held cadre and mass meetings on September 11th and 12th to conduct research and discussion. Duan Migui said, "In the past, we couldn't even plant 30% of our wheat, always falling behind. This year we must expand our wheat fields, to plant 50% or more. If you don't plant early, how can we expand?" Shang Fulin said, "This year there is an extra month, and there has been a lot of rain, the land is wet and heavy. This autumn will be cold early, freeze early, and have frost early, so we must hurry ahead. We can only plant ahead, not fall behind. Early planting means early harvest." Yang Xiaoxue said, "I always plant wheat three days before White Dew. I want to plant early to save seed, and the seedlings will emerge quickly, the roots will be deep, and it will be drought-resistant, cold-resistant, and yield a good harvest. Planting late wastes seed, the seedlings don't emerge, the roots don't go deep, it's not drought-resistant, not cold-resistant, and it's hard to get a good harvest." After repeated discussions, the cadres and masses' thinking was cleared, and they unanimously decided to move forward. Everyone put forward the action slogan: "Seize the time to plant wheat, first come, first served; we can't let people wait for the sky, but the sky wait for people." It was decided that from now until the fifth day of the eighth lunar month, all 2,639 mu of wheat in the village would be planted. All men, women, young, and old in the village are rushing to plant wheat from early morning till late at night. For example, under the active leadership of Duan Migui, the Second Squad mobilized on the night of the 11th. The old men carried lanterns, the young people carried buckets, and sixteen people hauled 128 buckets of manure to the fields overnight. On the night of the 12th, eight old men, including Qin Qicai and Wang Wende, also competed to participate in hauling manure. Everyone's enthusiasm is very high. The whole village is currently in a hot and heavy rush to plant wheat. (Tu Chang, San Ping)

    冻早霜早赶早下种
    微子镇群众打破消停等待
    连夜送粪抢种麦
    【本报潞城讯】二区微子镇，月前大部份干部及群众，都对种麦存在着：“七月白露八月种，白露中种上才合垄”的等节令思想贾安科说：“现在群众都是等晒干地皮，耙一耙，消消停停才种，现在就犁成的地，也都不种。”常招群说：“桥上这个大队，已准备好三百多亩成地，不往地里下种，就是等着晒干地皮才种。”领导上为打破群众的消停等节令思想，特于九月十一、十二日分别召开了干部群众会，进行了研究讨论，段米贵说：“过去咱种麦还种不上百分之三十，每年总是赶不上，今年咱要扩大麦田，要种到百分之五十以上，你不早种，咱还能扩大麦田？”尚福林说：“今年润一个月，天又下雨多，地里湿垧重，今秋要冷早、冻早、霜早咱得往前赶。只能种在头，不能落在后，早种就能早收。”杨小雪说：“我以前总是白露前三天，就要种麦，我想种在头里省麦种，又发苗，根又深，又耐旱，又受冻，还不少打麦；种在后底，又费麦种，又不发苗，根也扎不深，不耐旱，不耐冻，也多打不上麦。”经过反复讨论，干部群众思想打通了，都一致决定往前赶，大家提出：“抢天种麦，先下手为强，能叫人等天，不叫天等人”的行动口号来，并决定从现在起到阴历八月初五日前，全村将二千六百三十九亩麦全部下种，全村男女老少都是起早搭黑连明连夜的抢着种麦，如二分队在段米贵的积极领导下，十一日黑夜全队动员起来，老汉们提灯，青年人担罐，十六人一夜往地担灌一百二十八担；十二日夜，秦起才、王文德等八个老汉也都争着参加了担罐，大家劲头非常大。现全村正在热火朝天的突击种麦中。（土长、三平）
