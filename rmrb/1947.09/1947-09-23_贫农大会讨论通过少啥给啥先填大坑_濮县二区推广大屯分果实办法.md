[This report from our newspaper comes from] Ji-Lu-Yu, 21st: The masses in Datun Village, Puyang County's Sixth District, democratically discussed the method of distributing fruits, truly achieving the goal of leveling the playing field. This method has now been promoted throughout the district, with 46 villages implementing it. The fruit distribution method in this village, decided upon after mass discussion, first involved selecting the "big pits" and "small pits" by comparing lives and comparing three generations. Next, the fruits were displayed for everyone to see. The third step was to hold family meetings before distributing the fruits, where the whole family discussed and considered what they wanted. The fourth step was to attach labels to the items each person requested, which were then recorded by the secretary. Next, the selected evaluation committee members (seven people) filled the gaps in order, starting with the "big pits" and moving down to the "small pits." After the evaluation, a general meeting of poor peasants was convened to announce the evaluation results, followed by group discussions. After there were no objections, people came up one household at a time to receive their items, achieving the goal of giving what was lacking. When distributing wheat, the method of dividing into three categories of "poor pits" based on comparing lives, comparing three generations, and existing grain supplies was still used. Chen Kun and more than ten other families voluntarily declined because they had enough to eat. Therefore, the masses were very satisfied with this fruit distribution. Poor peasant Lin Tingyou happily said: "I've never used a big vat before, and now I've got one, which is just right." After the district committee discovered the fruit distribution method in this village, it has now been promoted to 46 villages throughout the district for implementation.

    贫农大会讨论通过少啥给啥先填大坑
    濮县二区推广大屯分果实办法
    【本报冀鲁豫二十一日电】濮县六区大屯村群众，民主讨论分果实办法，做到真正填平补齐，现已推动全区，有四十六个村照该办法实行。该村分果实办法，经群众讨论决定，先是用大家比生活、比三代的方法，选出大坑小坑。接着，展览果实，让大家参观。第三步在分果实前开家庭会议，全家商量酝酿所要的东西。第四步按各人要求分的东西，贴上条子，由书记登记下来。接着由选出的评议委员（七人）按大坑小坑依次填补。评议完后，召开全体贫农大会，宣布评议结果，分组讨论酝酿，无意见后，一户户分领东西，达到少啥给啥。分麦子时，仍是按比生活比三代和现有粮食分为三等穷坑的办法来填补，陈坤等十余家因够吃自动不要。因此这次分果实群众很满意。贫农林廷友喜欢的说：“俺没用过大缸，这回得到大缸正好。”区委发现该村分果实办法后，现已推广至全区四十六个村实行。
