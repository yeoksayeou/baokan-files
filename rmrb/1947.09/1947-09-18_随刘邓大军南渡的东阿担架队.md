The following passage is excerpted from the "Stretcher Special Issue" of the "Rural Life Newspaper" of Dong'a County, Hebei-Shandong-Henan Province. The county dispatched 496 stretchers, with over 3,500 cadres, administrative staff, and civilians participating. They traveled for more than 50 days, marching over 1,600 li, enduring heavy rain, mud, artillery fire, and aircraft strafing and bombing. Throughout, none deserted, all completed their missions, and returned gloriously, already receiving commendations from the troops. This passage is only a fragment, but it shows the people's boundless love for the People's Liberation Army.

    The civilians constantly said, "We got two mu of land and turned ourselves over! Isn't that thanks to the soldiers risking their lives and shedding blood? What's it matter if our clothes get wet in the rain and we fall down and get up again? The soldiers suffer much more than us! We can endure it for a few days!"
    Marching at night, rain falling from above and mud on the ground, they often ended up walking alongside the troops. The civilians would automatically suggest, "Let's move aside and wait, let the comrades pass first, then we'll go!" So this long line of five or six hundred people would hide to one side, getting soaked and trudging through the mud, waiting for almost an hour or more.
    On the night of July 28th, walking to the Bali Ravine east of Lü Village, the army's artillery vehicles, pack mules, and so on also arrived here. The ravine was narrow, so the civilians stuck to one side to let the troops pass. The rain was pouring down heavily, the ravine was flowing with half a foot of water, the ground was uneven and slippery, and the soldiers kept falling down. The civilians forgot about the cold and wet on their own bodies, and passed the word to each other, "Look at how much they're suffering, it's all because of that traitor Chiang Kai-shek! Help the comrades up, hurry up!" Lu Shouye, the platoon leader of the Second Battalion, stood on the edge of the cliff and pulled the soldiers up one by one, getting covered in mud. They waited in the ravine for about two hours until the troops had passed. The civilians were soaked in water and covered in mud, unconsciously shivering, some with their teeth chattering.
    When the Yuncheng battle opened at the South Gate, 204 stretchers from the Third and Fourth Battalions took over the task. The enemy's artillery fire was hitting the South Gate, and planes were constantly strafing with machine guns and dropping bombs, which was very dangerous. But the civilians were not afraid at all and were in high spirits. Seventy stretchers from the first, third, and fifth companies of the Third Battalion all arrived at the battlefield. Feeling they were too conspicuous, they took off their jackets, bared their backs, and shouted to the front line, running over immediately without stopping for a moment. Fang Wenhe and Wang Yuhang were wounded, but the others were not affected at all. They carried them down themselves and went on. Huang Xinchi, Zhao Chuanshan, Ren Yuping, Tan Guangting, Tan Chengjiao, and others carried two or three trips, covered in blood, with blood also on the stretcher blankets. When the wounded didn't have pillows, they rolled up their pants to use as pillows; when the wounds felt empty, they folded handkerchiefs to pad them, without any complaints or hesitation. The sixty civilians of the First Company carried sixty door panels to the front line and then carried the wounded down. Tan Bingren of the Third Company carried two trips, one a martyr and the other a lightly wounded soldier. During the day, he went back to carry again and was hit by a machine gun, but he wasn't upset at all and even said to people, "It doesn't matter to me, just go home and say I haven't taken on a task yet! So everyone doesn't worry. It's nothing, aren't the soldiers risking their lives and shedding blood for us?"
    The Second Company took on the task during the day. Although the planes were strafing tightly, it didn't stop them. The third platoon washed the face of a martyr they were carrying, placed him properly, and more than twenty people went to a landlord's house to carry back a large celebratory coffin to bury the martyr. When the wounded carried by the Third and Fourth Battalions went to the brigade health station to change their dressings, the planes were strafing back and forth during the day, but the civilians still guarded the stretchers and asked the wounded, "Are you lying comfortably?" "Are you thirsty?" They gave the wounded soup, fried dough sticks, pastries, and eggs to eat (because the civilians usually saved money by eating elm leaves and used the money saved from not eating vegetables to buy pastries, crispy sesame cakes, fried dough sticks, and eggs). They said words of gratitude to comfort the wounded. Political Instructor Dong of the mountain artillery company said to the comrades at the health station, "The stretchers from Dong'a are really good. When I didn't have a pillow, they took off their pants to give me one. When the wound felt empty, I said to pad it with my blanket, but they were afraid of getting blood on it, so they took out their handkerchiefs and folded them to pad it for me."
    The stretchers of the Fifth Battalion were originally at the Ministry of Health, burning water all night for over ten thousand civilians to drink. But when stretchers were needed at the front line, people from other counties dared not go. These civilians, who hadn't slept all night and hadn't eaten, ran to Yuncheng, where planes were strafing crazily.
    During the attack on the stronghold at Yangshanji, thirty-two stretchers from the first and third companies of the Second Battalion accepted the task. A multiple of roads lead to the front line, and five or six planes were constantly strafing in the air. Platoon Leader Li Dianrong led the civilians to bury the martyr under machine gun fire, carrying the coffin. Li Wenxiu, wearing a white jacket, reached out and carried the wounded soldier onto the stretcher, getting covered in blood. Before lifting, he first asked the wounded how to lift him comfortably. After lifting, the cadres and civilians passed the word to each other, "Slowly, lift him steadily." A little comrade kept crying, and the civilians explained to him, "Comrade, don't cry, you'll feel more pain if you cry."...

### 随刘邓大军南渡的东阿担架队

　　随刘邓大军南渡的东阿担架队
    下面一段文字，是从冀鲁豫东阿县农村生活报，担架特刊上摘录下来的。该县此次出担架四百九十六付，干部杂务人员民夫三千五百余人参加，他们往返五十余天，行军一千六百多里，大雨泥泞，炮火威胁，飞机扫射轰炸下，始终无逃亡者，都完成了任务，光荣归来，并已获得部队表扬。这段文字只是个片段，但可以看到人民对于人民解放大军无比的热爱。　　　　　　　　　　　——编者
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    民夫中不断的传说着“咱分了二亩地翻身啦！还不是亏了战士拚命流血干来的？下雨淋湿了衣裳，滑倒爬起来这算得了什么，人家战士比咱多受多少罪？咱可受几天哩？”
    夜间行军，上边下雨，地上是泥，往往和部队走到一堆，民夫们自动的提出“咱闪到一边等等，让同志们过去咱再走！”于是这长长的行列五六百人就躲到一边，挨着淋、踏着泥，差不多就等点多钟。
    七月二十八日夜间，走到吕村东边八里沟里，部队的炮车，驮骡等也走到这里，沟里窄，民夫们就贴在一边让部队过，雨哗啦哗啦下的很大，沟里淌着半尺深的水，高低不平脚又滑，战士们一个一个不断的摔倒，民夫忘了自己身上的冷和湿，相互传着“你看遭多大罪，净蒋介石那小子卖国卖的，扶着同志点，赶快啦起来”。二营排长卢守业站在崖头上把战士一个个拉上来，弄的满身都是泥，在沟里等了有两个钟头，部队过完了。民夫们混身是水是泥，都不自觉的发着抖，有的牙在碰着响。
    郓城战役打开南关时，三、四营的二百零四付接上任务，敌人的炮火打在南关里，飞机也不住的打机枪，掷炸弹，确实很危险，但民夫都一点没有害怕，情绪很高；三营一、三、五连有七十付都到了战场，嫌目标大，都脱下褂子，光着脊梁，叫上火线，马上跑着去，没停留一会。方文河、王玉行被打伤了，其他人没受任何影响，自己背下来抬着就走，黄心池、赵传山、任玉坡、谭广庭、谭成教等都背两三趟，满身都是血，担架的被子上也是血；伤员没枕头，拿裤子一卷给枕上，伤口空的慌，拿手巾一摺给垫上，都没嫌过，毫不迟疑；一连的六十个民夫，背着六十块门板，运到火线上，又抬着伤员下来；三连谭丙三背了两趟，一个是烈士，一个是轻伤号，白天他又回去背时被机枪打着了，但一点没难过，还对人说：“我这不要紧，您家去就说还没接上任务哩！省的都不放心，这不算点事，看人家战士拚命流血还不是为了咱吗？”
    二连白天接的任务，虽然飞机扫射的很紧，但没有挡着，三排抬的烈士，亲自给他洗洗脸，安放端正，二十多个人到地主家抬一个大喜棺来把烈士安葬了；三、四营抬的伤员到旅卫生处换药时，白天飞机来回扫射，民夫仍守着担架问问伤员：“躺的合适吧？”“渴吧”。给伤员汤喝，油炸果、点心、鸡子吃，（因民夫平时就摞榆叶吃，省下面炒了作汤；不吃菜省下钱买成点心，到口酥、油炸果、鸡子）说感激的话安慰伤员；山炮连董指导员对卫生处的同志说：“东阿的担架真好，我没枕头他们脱下裤子来给我枕上，伤口空的慌，我说垫上我的被单子，他们怕血脏了，都把手巾拿出来折折给我垫上。”
    五营的担架原在卫生部，烧了一夜水，共万多民夫喝了，但火线用担架时，别县的不敢去，这些一夜没睡，饭也没吃的民夫跑着就到郓城去了，这时飞机正在疯狂的扫射。
    羊山集打据点时，二营的一三连三十二付接受任务，离火线里多路，飞机五、六架不断在空中扫射，班长李殿荣带民夫在机枪扫射下抬着棺材把烈士安葬好，李文修穿着白褂子伸手把伤员抱到担架上，弄了一身血，临抬时先问问伤员怎样抬法得力，抬起后干部民夫互相传着“慢慢的，抬的稳当点”，一个小同志净哭，民夫给他解释“同志别哭，看越哭越疼”。…………
