    Taihang First Military Sub-district Militia Expeditionary Explosives Team
    Supports the Northern Front to Defend the Autumn Harvest
    [This Newspaper's Report] The Taihang First Military Sub-district Militia Expeditionary Explosives Team is supporting the northern front to defend the autumn harvest. On September 11th, when laying landmines near Zhicun Village in Yuanshi County, the enemy set out to Zhicun to seize grain. By sheer coincidence, they triggered a landmine, instantly killing three enemies and wounding two. This blow dealt a powerful blow to the enemy's arrogance in seizing grain, making them afraid to set foot anywhere due to the fear of mines. It encouraged the border areas to protect the autumn harvest, distribute land, and rush to harvest crops. The masses excitedly said, "The first shot was a success, ensuring land distribution and the autumn harvest." (First Military Sub-district Communication Group)
    [This Newspaper's Report] On September 8th, the Yuanshi Chiang Kai-shek army's political organs organized more than 400 members of the militia self-defense teams from ten villages in the Fifth District, along with two or three large carts, each carrying sickles, shoulder poles, and other tools. Under the slogan "The troops can shed blood, and we can shed sweat, starving the bandit Wei (Yonghe) to death in the city," they rushed to Zhicun to seize the harvest. The troops provided cover in front, firing guns wildly, while simultaneously harvesting and transporting the grain to the rear. By noon, they had recovered 100 mu of sorghum and millet belonging to the traitors and feudal landlords who had fled to the city. In the afternoon, the militia self-defense teams from nine villages happily set out again towards Beigou, and by evening, they had harvested and transported another 120 mu of autumn grain belonging to the traitors and landlords who had fled to the city.

    [This Newspaper's JiluYu Report on the 22nd] The Linze County Brigade is protecting the masses' autumn harvest and effectively打击打击 the enemy's grain seizure and requisitioning efforts. Since our main force went south, the enemy puppet township head, Dong Changqin, has led 40 to 50 people to seize grain in the Second District of Linze. On August 27th, at dawn, the First Company of our Linze Brigade ambushed the grain-seizing enemies in Caozhuang. At about 8:00 AM, a small group of eight enemies went straight to Caozhuang. After entering the ambush circle, our machine guns, rifles, and pistols fired simultaneously, catching the enemy off guard. The battle ended in five minutes, capturing three enemies alive, killing three, and two escaping (one with internal injuries). We seized seven rifles and 350 rounds of ammunition. On August 9th, the Zhang Peixiu unit of the enemy's home-returning corps, numbering over 100, held a joint meeting of puppet village chiefs in Yanliang Town, arranging for grain and manpower requisitioning. After we discovered this, Zhao, the company commander of the Linze Brigade, led a platoon, in coordination with the militia, to proceed to the area. At the sound of the machine guns, the enemy was thrown into panic and fled south in disarray.
