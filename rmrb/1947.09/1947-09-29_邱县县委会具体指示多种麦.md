Qiu County Committee
Specific Instructions to Plant More Wheat

[Report from our reporter group on the 27th] Farmers in Qiu County are actively preparing to plant wheat in accordance with the instructions of the County Committee. In order to remedy the poor autumn and wheat harvests this year (wheat harvest was 40-50%, autumn harvest was 50-60%), the County Committee called on the county to vigorously and intensively plant wheat, without hindering the autumn harvest. According to the specific conditions of each district, the number of wheat to be planted was proposed. For example, the second district currently has 146,829 mu of cultivated land. The district lacks both manpower and animal power, so it is required to plant 48,400 mu of wheat this year, accounting for 33% of the district's current cultivated land; the county as a whole will plant 171,962 mu of wheat, averaging 2.5 mu per person. The Qiu County Committee emphasized the following tasks: (1) Qiu County has suffered from a major famine for 32 years, and both manpower and farm tools are very scarce, especially for poor peasants (according to their pre-liberation status), who have more difficulties. Therefore, first, in this year's wheat planting, we must vigorously carry out the mutual aid movement. On the principle of voluntary participation by the masses, it does not matter whether it is temporary or long-term, as long as it is organized. Villages with mutual aid teams should guide the masses to implement reasonable exchange of equal value. Second, the masses in the county should get up early and go to bed late, increase working hours, and mobilize all able-bodied and semi-able-bodied men and women in the county to participate in wheat planting. Women and children should do more odd jobs in the autumn harvest and wheat planting to free up more male labor for wheat planting. Third, villages should exchange labor with each other. The western villages in the third and fourth districts have a later autumn harvest, and the land is deeply flooded due to heavy rain this year, so wheat cannot be planted temporarily. They have surplus animal and human power, so they should be mobilized to exchange labor with the eastern villages. Fourth, district joint cooperatives and village cooperatives should be mobilized to support poor peasants as much as possible. The practice of the first district joint cooperative buying dozens of cattle and lending them to poor peasants for wheat planting without compensation should be commended and promoted. Fifth, attention should be paid to helping poor peasants solve the difficulty of lacking farm tools, and all broken farm tools should be repaired. (2) At present, the great counter-offensive is beginning, and preparations should be made for participating in the war. We should learn from the exchange of labor method that combines war support and production in Nanliu Village, and launch the creation of new methods. (3) Launch a large-scale merit and model movement; in villages without mutual aid teams, it should be proposed that whoever can lead the masses to plant more wheat will be credited with a merit. After the wheat is planted, heroes of the autumn harvest and wheat planting should be elected, and meritorious persons should be evaluated. (4) Conduct universal propaganda and education among the masses, with cadres becoming propagandists and schools organizing propaganda teams. Slogans such as "One wheat is worth three autumns, and we cannot live without wheat" and "Plant more wheat this year, and we will not go hungry next year" should be put forward to educate the masses and create a wheat planting movement. (5) In leadership, efforts should be organized to create experience. The county should temporarily set up small newspapers to disseminate and exchange the experiences and new creations of various districts. Finally, it was pointed out that attention should be paid to mole crickets when planting wheat. (Zhu Bo)

    邱县县委会
    具体指示多种麦
    【本报记者团廿七日电】邱县农民正依据县委指示，积极进行种麦准备。为补救今年秋、麦的歉收（麦收四、五成，秋收五、六成），县委号召全县在不妨碍秋收原则下，大力突击种麦。根据各区的具体情况，提出种麦的数目，如二区现种地十四万六千八百二十九亩，该区人力畜力均缺乏，要求今年种麦四万八千四百亩，占全区现种地百分之三十三；全县共种麦十七万一千九百六十二亩，按人口平均每人合二亩五分。该县县委强调进行以下几个工作：（一）邱县经过三十二年大灾荒袭击，人力农具都非常缺乏，特别贫农（按未翻身前的成份）困难更多。因此，第一、在今年的种麦中大力开展互助运动，在群众自愿的条件下，不管临时的长期的只要组织起就好。有互助组的村庄，应引导群众实行合理的等价交换。第二、全县群众早起晚睡，增加劳作时间，动员全县所有男女整半劳动力，都参加种麦，妇女儿童更多做些秋收种麦中的零活，腾出更多的男劳动力种麦。第三、村与村进行换工，三、四区西部村庄秋收较晚，加以今年雨多地里积水很深，暂时不能种麦，畜力人力都有剩余，动员他们与东部村庄换工；第四、发动区联社村合作社，尽力支援贫苦农民，一区联社买十几条牛，无代价借给贫苦农民种麦的办法，应该表扬提倡。第五、注意帮助贫农解决农具缺乏的困难，将所有的坏农具都修理起来。（二）目前正是大反攻的开始，应做好参战的准备，学习南刘村战勤与生产结合的换工办法，并发动创造新方法。（三）发动大规模的立功表模运动；在没有互助组的村庄，提出谁能带领群众多多种麦，就能立一功。种完麦选举秋收种麦的英雄，并进行评选功臣。（四）对群众进行普遍宣传教育，干部成为宣传员，学校组织宣传队，提出“一麦顶三秋，无麦不能活”，“今年种麦多，明年不挨饿”等口号，教育群众，造成一个种麦运动。（五）在领导上应组织力量创造经验，县临时创办小型报纸，传播与交流各区经验及新创造。最后指出种麦注意蝼蛄。（朱波）
