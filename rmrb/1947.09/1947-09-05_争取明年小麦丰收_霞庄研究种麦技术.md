Striving for a Bumper Wheat Harvest Next Year
Xia Village Studies Wheat Planting Techniques

[Report from this newspaper in Licheng] After the heroic cadres and production activists of Xia Village participated in the key point meeting on the 24th of last month and clarified the current central tasks (accumulating fertilizer, repairing wheat fields, and preparing for wheat sowing), each group actively researched and discussed, and formulated its own fertilizer accumulation and sowing plan. However, due to the lack of rain in the first half of the year and the failure to rot green manure, labor heroes Wang Fengqi and Wang Jinming, etc., convened technician Wang Xiaotu and others from the technical committee on the night of the 26th to study the complete set of techniques for wheat sowing:

I. Combination and Use of Fertilizers

Based on the current fertilizer accumulation situation of each group, in addition to continuing to find ways to rot and accumulate green manure and organize sheep flocks to lie on the ground, the combination and use of fertilizer technologies were also studied to further improve fertilizer efficiency and increase yields: (1) Use three catties of sesame oil per mu to mix the wheat seeds well, expose them to the sun, then crush and mix them with dry cliff soil, and sow them in the ground. According to past experience, this can withstand 25 loads of compost fertilizer per mu. (2) Use eight catties of black beans per mu, crush and cook them, mix with some soil to ferment and rot. When sowing, spread them in the ground with the soil, and the effect is significant. (3) Use twelve loads of compost fertilizer per mu, mixed with night soil and some soil, and use a plow to sow the seeds and soil together. This saves fertilizer and labor (three people with one animal can sow six mu per day). (4) Use ten or so sesame cakes per mu, crush them, mix with some soil, form small round piles in the ground, and let them ferment for two days. Then mix the seeds with them and sow. (5) Use six dan of night soil per mu (more is better). First, use a plow to dig trenches, and then spread the night soil and seeds in the trenches and level them. Labor heroes Wang Fengqi and Wang Jinming said: "According to past experience, the above methods are the most effective."

II. Wheat Field Preparation:

For dry land, it is generally necessary to plow three times. The first plowing was completed after the wheat harvest. The second plowing has now been completed on one-third of all wheat fields and is being completed in a concentrated effort. Technician Wang Xiaotu said: "To cultivate thousands of acres of land, you rely entirely on smoothing out each plowing. When we plow twice, we must plow deeper and more carefully." Wang Fengqi said: "The second plowing is deep and careful, which is equal to one season of fertilizer." Secondly, the middle of sloping land should be leveled, and the outside should be built into high edges, which makes it easy to retain water. In order to properly use fertilizer, in addition to dibbling most of the wheat fields, the land with more fertilizer should be completely changed to sowing with a two-legged rake.

III. Universally Disinfect and Soak Seeds.

Four methods of soaking seeds were studied:

(1) Warm Water Soaking: First, use five bowls of boiling water and five bowls of cold water to soak the wheat seeds. After the time it takes to eat a bowl of rice, take them out. Then soak them in a mixture of six bowls of boiling water and four bowls of cold water. After the time it takes to eat a bowl of rice, take them out, dry them in the sun, and sow them.

(2) Salt Water Soaking: Every ten bowls of water should be mixed with four liang of salt to soak one shi dou of wheat seeds. After the time it takes to smoke two cigarettes, take them out, dry them in the sun, and then sow them in the ground.

(3) Soaking with Lime Water: First, use less water. Mix the quicklime separately, continue to pour in some water to make lime water, remove the residue, immerse the wheat seeds, and after the time it takes to eat half a bowl of rice, take them out, dry them in the sun, and sow them.

(4) Soaking with Ash Water: Pour water over the plant ash, immerse the wheat seeds, and after the time it takes to eat a bowl of rice, take them out, dry them in the sun, and sow them. Labor hero Wang Fengqi said: "Past experience has proven that the above four methods can eliminate black mildew and jaundice on the one hand, and on the other hand, the wheat is easy to germinate, and the seedlings are neat and fat after they emerge from the soil.”

　　争取明年小麦丰收
  　霞庄研究种麦技术
    【本报黎城讯】霞庄村的英雄干部和生产积极分子，于上月二十四日参加基点会议，明确了目前中心工作（积肥，修整麦田，准备小麦下种）以后，各个小组积极的研究讨论，定出了自己的积肥下种计划。但由于前半年缺雨，没有沤下绿肥，劳英王逢奇和王金名等，于二十六日夜召集技委会的技术员王小秃等，研究了在小麦下种当中的整套技术：
    一、肥料的配合与使用
    根据各组目前积肥情况，除仍须设法沤积绿肥和组织羊群卧地外，并研究了肥料的配合与使用技术，进一步提高肥料的效率，增加产量：（一）每亩用大麻油三斤，把麦籽很好搅拌搓匀，放在日光下晒一晒，再用干崖土打碎搅和，点种在地里，根据过去经验，能顶住每亩地上二十五驮堆肥。（二）每亩用黑豆八斤，碾破煮熟，和些土，使发酵腐烂，下种时，连土溜在地里，效力很大。（三）每亩用堆肥十二驮，拌圊肥，加些土，把种籽和土，用犁点种，这样省肥也省工（每犋牲口三个人，一天能点种六亩）。（四）每亩用油饼十来个，碾碎，拌些土，在地里修成些小圆堆，闷两天，使发酵，然后把种籽和上点种。（五）每亩用圊肥六担（多了更好）先用犁耕开壕儿，照壕儿把圊和种籽溜里捞平。以上各种办法，劳英王逢奇和王金名说：“根据过去的经验，都是最有效力的。”
    二、麦田整理：
    垡旱地普遍要耕够三犁，第一犁在麦收后，已全部耕过，第二犁，目前已耕了全部麦田三分之一，正在突击完成。技术员王小秃说：“家种千顷地，全凭顺一张犁，咱们耕二犁，一定要耕深一些，细一些。”王逢奇说：“二犁耕的深又细，顶上一季肥”，其次是仄仄地中间要打腰板，外面打成高边，容易挡水。为了适当的便用肥料，除大部麦田进行点种外，肥料较多的地要完全改用两条腿耧下种。
    三、普遍进行消毒浸种。
    研究出四点浸种办法：
    （一）温汤浸种：第一次先用开水冷水各五碗，把麦籽浸入，经吃一碗饭时间捞出，再浸入六碗开水四碗冷水的混合水中，经吃一碗饭时间，捞出，晒干，播种。
    （二）盐汤浸种：每十碗水和四两盐，可以浸一市斗麦籽，经吸两袋烟工夫，捞出，晒干，就可以往地里种。
    （三）用石灰汁浸种：先用少一些水。把生石灰分开拌和，继续倾入些水，使成石灰汁、捞出渣滓，把麦籽浸入，经吃半碗饭时间，捞出，晒干，播种。
    （四）用灰水浸种：把草木灰，用水淋下来，把麦籽浸入，经吃一碗饭时间，捞出，晒干，播种。劳英王逢奇说：“以上四种办法根据过去经验证明，一方面能消除乌霉和黄疸病，另方面麦子容易发芽，苗儿出土后，很齐楚，也肥大。（次孟·隆兴·长群·麦生）
