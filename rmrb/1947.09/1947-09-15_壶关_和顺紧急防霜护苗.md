　　Hukuan and Heshun
  　Urgently Prevent Frost and Protect Seedlings
    [Report from our newspaper in Hukuan] The Hukuan County Committee issued a call for the district committees and branches to lead the masses in lighting fires to prevent frost. The cadres and masses in the entire county seat responded first. The period three days before and four days after the White Dew solar term is most prone to frost. Recently, the weather has been continuously cloudy and windy, and the climate has become cooler, posing a risk of frost damage to autumn seedlings. To this end, the County Committee issued an urgent notice to all district committees, branches, and village cadres, urging them to immediately mobilize and organize the masses to prevent frost. The notice stated: First, it is imperative to break through the masses' paralysis and fluke mentality, take active actions to prevent frost, and devise ways to overcome frost disasters. If preventive measures are not taken early, the arrival of frost will create even greater difficulties. Second, immediately organize the masses to prepare firewood and chaff, and once the climate changes, light fires and create smoke in wind-prone areas and shady areas prone to early frost, to change the climate and block wind barriers. After receiving the notice, the masses in the county seat immediately convened a meeting of cadres to study the wind and frost paths. Each household prepared fifty catties of firewood, and experienced individuals were assigned to stand guard. Once the wind arrived and the climate changed drastically, the guards would sound gongs as a signal to mobilize the masses to light fires in all directions, modify the climate, and overcome the frost disaster. Finally, a frost prevention inspection committee was selected to strictly supervise and inspect, earnestly respond to the County Committee's call, and block the frost damage. (Liang Yu)
    [Report from our newspaper in Heshun] The First District is preventing frost from attacking autumn crops (frost occurs early every year, resulting in poor harvests), protecting seedlings to promote early maturity. In mid-August, 38 administrative villages universally established bonfire platforms. The entire district gathered 24,800 catties of firewood in one day, organized seven frost prevention command posts, organized frost prevention sentries with dedicated personnel, and built thirteen bonfire platforms. Seeing that frost was about to fall, cannons were fired as a signal to start fires everywhere. Ma Zhitian, director of the North Gate Military Committee, led the village in cutting 702 loads of firewood in one day and set up twelve bonfire platforms. Ren Yuanhan, a small village, set up forty-three bonfire platforms. Currently, frost prevention has been universally implemented throughout the county. In addition, corn tassels were cut off, and smut was checked; once found, it was immediately stripped off to promote the early and full maturity of the ears. (Gui Lin)
