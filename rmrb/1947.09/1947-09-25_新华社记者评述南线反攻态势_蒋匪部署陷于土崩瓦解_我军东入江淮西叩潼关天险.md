Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains Front, September 23rd: Frontline reporter Xie Wenyao commented on the enemy and our situation since the southward expedition of Liu and Deng's counter-offensive army, stating: The great counter-offensive action of the southward People's Liberation Army has thrown the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang into a panic, disrupted their deployments, and shaken their morale. This unprecedentedly serious situation began with the annihilation of nine and a half brigades of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit army in southwestern Shandong. At that time, in order to save the critical situation of this unprecedented disastrous defeat, Chiang Kai-shek dismissed and investigated Wang Zhonglian, and at the same time, at the cost of dismantling his "key offensive" in Shandong, he pieced together more than a dozen brigades of troops, plus the remnants of the defeated soldiers from southwestern Shandong. In early August, they moved north in two routes from both ends of the Heze-Juye highway, forming a so-called "pincer offensive," attempting to annihilate the People's Liberation Army between the Heze-Juye highway and the Yellow River. Unexpectedly, as soon as the deployment was completed, the People's Liberation Army crossed the Longhai Railway to the south and began its long-planned southern expedition. Chiang Kai-shek's use of Okamura Neji's "iron-footed joint attack" completely failed. Moreover, due to the People's Liberation Army's rapid advance to the south, Chiang Kai-shek attempted "encirclement and annihilation" three times in the short seven days from August 7th to 14th, and had to change his deployments three times, completely in a passive position. After messing around on both sides of the railway, Chiang Kai-shek completely failed to see where the direction of the People's Liberation Army's iron hammer strike south of the Longhai Railway would fall. Chiang Kai-shek and his headquarters always thought that the Liu-Deng army would cross to the north or be forced to move south. Their stupidity and lack of strategic vision are astonishing. It was not until after August 14th that the southward army suddenly appeared south of the Shahe River that Chiang Kai-shek panicked. In order to cover up his panic and confusion, and unwilling and daring to admit that the southward action of the People's Liberation Army was a predetermined huge counter-offensive action, he had no choice but to call out the Central News Agency to clamor about the so-called "Liu bandits being completely annihilated at the Shahe River" to make fun of himself. What plagued the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang was that the pursuing troops were within sight but unattainable. Only one blocking action on the Ru River ended in a disastrous defeat. Moreover, there was not a single soldier north of the Yangtze River who could block the advance of the People's Liberation Army. The southward army threw all of Chiang Kai-shek's pursuing troops far behind, crossed the Huai River calmly, and entered the Dabie Mountains. All of Chiang Kai-shek's so-called "encirclement and annihilation," "pursuit," and "blocking" have become mere words on paper. The People's Liberation Army is now galloping between the Yangtze and Huai Rivers, like dragons entering the sea, moving freely and unconstrained. It advances wherever it pleases. It can cross the Pinghan Railway to the west and enter the Tongbai Mountains at any time, or cross the Yangtze River to the south and gain a foothold in Hunan and Jiangxi, or go east to central Anhui and knock on the gates of Nanjing and Wuhu, or return north and cross the Yellow River again. The Chiang Kai-shek bandit army is bumping east and west, neglecting one thing for another, guarding against everything, but unable to guard against anything. The 48th Division bumped into Guangshan and Jingfu twice, suddenly felt something was wrong, and turned tail and ran east to western Anhui to encircle and rescue Hefei. The 58th Division hovered between Guding and Shangcheng. Luo Guangwen and the 85th Division and other units shrank east of Pinghan, daring not to move. The 33rd Brigade of the 52nd Division had just arrived when it suddenly returned to defend Wuhan, and the 65th Division also hurriedly rushed back to Hankou along Pinghan. The Zhengzhou Forward Command Post of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit army moved from Heze to Kaifeng to Xinyang, only able to watch the backs of the Liu-Deng army. The 206th Division and the 3rd Division and others had just "chased" to Xuchang and Zhengyang when suddenly western Henan sounded the alarm, and they turned west to Luoyang midway. Chiang Kai-shek and his headquarters revealed their panicked and overwhelmed state. As for the Chiang Kai-shek bandit army, it was even more exhausted, with soldiers deserting and morale plummeting to the extreme. A soldier who had just escaped from the 48th Division said: The soldiers of the division mostly waded barefoot and ate two thin gruel meals a day. The soldiers originally captured in the Dabie Mountains were all fleeing. Each company originally had more than one hundred people, but now only fifty or sixty remain. Many conscripts captured in Dingtao and Cao County in southwestern Shandong also deserted every day. Every time Chiang Kai-shek's bandits arrived in a place, they searched everywhere for laborers. When they acted, one group was soldiers and the other was civilians, which was extremely slow. Whenever their troops set out, they would light the incense they had looted from the homes of the common people and pray to heaven that the Eighth Route Army would not come. When they were thirty or forty miles west of Liu'an, they suddenly discovered that a unit of the People's Liberation Army was on their flank, and immediately fled north in a panic, like startled birds. In fact, the People's Liberation Army was still forty or fifty miles away from them. The 46th Division and the 174th Brigade of the 48th Division could see the city of Liu'an in an area more than ten miles northwest of Liu'an. The People's Liberation Army only used a very small unit to block them. From the 4th to the 14th of this month, the enemy did not dare to take a step forward in ten days.

Xinhua News Agency, Western Henan Front, September 23rd: Our correspondent Mu Xin commented on the situation in western Henan, saying: Since the westward crossing of the Chen-Xie counter-offensive army, it has captured ten cities in less than a month, liberated the vast area of western Henan, and entered 300 li into the depths of Chiang Kai-shek's territory, annihilating more than 25,000 of Chiang Kai-shek's garrison troops, including seven regiments of regular troops. Now our army is pressing on Luoyang in the east and approaching Tongguan in the west, controlling 520 li of the Longhai Railway, and smashing this strategically important artery of Chiang Kai-shek in the Central Plains. This victory powerfully coordinated with the various armies of the People's Liberation Army on the southern front, and is a timely and valuable contribution to the national counter-offensive. Chiang Kai-shek has been shaken across the board by this heavy blow, panicking and confused. Luoyang was startled several times in one night, and Xi'an was preparing for street fighting. On the north bank of the Yellow River, Chiang Kai-shek's bandits in southern Shanxi successively abandoned their remaining strongholds in Yuanqu and Potou (Meng County), while the remaining bandits in Yuncheng and Linfen are also being withdrawn. All of this proves that our army's transition from internal to external operations not only more powerfully sparked the people's anti-Chiang and anti-feudal struggles in the Chiang-controlled areas, but also more effectively defended the liberated areas. Chiang Kai-shek's bandits have exposed many flaws in this campaign, indicating that they are facing collapse. Among them, the three most significant points are: First, the morale is increasingly declining. The New 1st Brigade was a relatively strong force of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits, but it collapsed immediately after our attack, and more than 5,000 people, including the deputy brigade commander and below, were captured. They are full of pessimism and disappointment about Chiang Kai-shek's insistence on the civil war. The county seat of Shanxian was defended by the 135th Brigade, a battalion of the Youth Army, the field artillery battalion of the 36th Division, and the 1st Regiment of the Security Forces, but it was completely annihilated in three hours after our general attack. In previous battles, our enemy's casualties were one to ten. Second, the command is ineffective and completely passive. Troops are transferred east and west, running around in vain. Commanders at all levels have lost confidence and blame each other. The lower-level officers and soldiers of the New 1st Brigade complained about the incompetence of the brigade and regimental commanders, and Huang Yong cursed Hu Zongnan and others as big bastards. Hu Zhenying, the company commander of the howitzer company of the 11th Artillery Regiment, hated the infantry for failing to provide adequate cover, making the artillery the front line. Third, the masses' discipline is corrupt and they are hostile to the people. Before the liberation of Mianchi, it was looted by Chiang Kai-shek's bandits. Several banks and shops in the south gate of Shanxian were also looted by Chiang Kai-shek's bandits. In Zhujialou and other villages in the south of the city, the people's livestock, clothing, and bedding were all looted. The masses hate Chiang Kai-shek's atrocities so much that they gnash their teeth. All of these are fatal wounds to Chiang Kai-shek's bandits. After this campaign, the strategic system of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits has been disrupted, and their connection with the Northwest battlefield has also been cut off. The rear of Hu Zongnan's bandit gang has been exposed to our army. More good news will surely be reported from the western Henan battlefield in the future.

    新华社记者评述南线反攻态势
    蒋匪部署陷于土崩瓦解
    我军东入江淮西叩潼关天险
    【新华社中原前线二十三日电】前线记者谢文耀评述刘邓反攻大军南征以来敌我态势称：南下解放军的伟大反攻行动，使蒋家匪帮们张慌失措，部署错乱，军心动摇。空前严重局面是开始于蒋匪军九个半旅在鲁西南的覆灭，当时蒋匪为挽救此空前惨败的危局，一面将王仲廉撤职查办，一面不惜拆散其在山东的“重点攻势”，东拚西凑的抽调十几个旅的兵力，加上鲁西南的残兵败将，八月初分由菏（泽）钜（野）公路两端，两路北扑，构成所谓“钳形进攻”，妄图将解放军团歼于菏、钜公路与黄河之间；不料甫经部署就绪，解放军却以南越陇海而开始了早经布置好了的南征行动。蒋匪用冈村宁次之“铁脚合击”完全落空。而且由于解放军神速南进，从八月七日到十四日的短短七天当中，蒋匪曾三次妄谋“围歼”，而又不得不三次改变部署，完全处于被动。在铁路两侧乱忙了一阵，蒋匪全然看不见南出陇海的解放军铁锤打击的方向究竟将落在那里，蒋贼及其统帅部，始终以为刘邓大军是北渡或被迫南移，其愚蠢无知，缺乏战略眼光，可谓惊人。及至八月十四日以后，南下大军突然出现在沙河以南，蒋匪这才慌了手脚；为了掩盖他惊慌忙乱的丑态，又不愿意，也不敢于承认南下解放军的行动，乃是一个预定的巨大反攻行动；无可奈何之余，只好叫中央社出来叫嚣所谓“刘匪全部被歼于沙河”，以自解嘲。蒋家匪帮们所苦恼的是尾追部队，解放军既可望而不可及，在汝河仅有的一次阻击，亦告惨败。而长江以北的广大地区，更无一兵一卒可以阻击解放军的前进。南征大军把蒋匪一切尾追部队远远的扔在后面，从容渡过淮河，进入大别山区。蒋介石匪帮们的一切所谓“围歼”、“追击”、“堵击”，都已变成纸上的名词。解放军现正驰骋于江淮之间，如蛟龙入海，纵横自如；它高兴进兵那里，便进兵那里；随时可以西越平汉进入桐柏山区，或南渡大江插足湘赣，或东出皖中，而叩京芜之门，或回师北上，再渡黄河；蒋匪军则东碰西撞，顾此失彼，处处可防，而处处不可防。四十八师向光山、经扶碰了两下，忽然觉得不妙，又夹起尾巴掉头东奔皖西，围救合肥。五十八师则于固定、商城间徘徊不前；罗广文及八十五师等部，则龟缩于平汉东侧不敢动弹。五十二师之三十三旅才到，又忽然返防武汉，六十五师也急忙沿平汉赶回汉口。蒋匪军郑州前方指挥所，则由菏泽而开封而信阳，只能望着刘邓大军的背影移动。二零六师及第三师等才“追”到许昌、正阳，忽然豫西告警，又中途折转西奔洛阳。蒋贼及其统帅部手忙脚乱的窘态表露无遗。至于蒋匪军内部更是疲惫不堪，士兵逃亡，军心恐慌达于极点。甫由四十八师逃来之士兵谈：该师士兵多赤脚跋涉，日食两顿稀饭。原在大别山区所抓的兵，都纷纷逃亡。每连原有一百多人的，现只逃剩五六十人。许多在鲁西南定陶、曹县一带抓来的壮丁，也日有逃亡。蒋匪每到一地，即四出搜捕民夫，行动起来一股是兵，两股是民，异常迟缓。其部队每当出发时，即将从老百姓家里搜出的神香点燃，对天祷告八路军不要来。当行至六安以西三四十里处，忽然发觉解放军一部在其翼侧时，立即仓惶北折，有如惊弓之鸟，实则该解放军离彼等尚四五十里之遥。四十六师和四十八师之一七四旅，在六安西北十余里地区，可以望见六安城，解放军只以极小部队予以阻击，从本月四日到十四日十天之内，该敌竟未敢前进一步。
    【新华社豫西前线二十三日电】本社记者穆欣评论豫西形势称：陈谢反攻大军西渡以来，不到一月而连克十城，解放豫西广大地区，进入蒋匪纵深三百华里，歼灭蒋匪守军两万五千余人，其中正规军计七个团。现我大军东迫洛阳，西薄潼关，控制陇海铁路五百二十里，把蒋匪这条横贯中原有战略意义的大动脉打得稀烂。这一胜利，有力的策应了人民解放军南线各路大军，对于全国大反攻是一个适则而有价值的贡献。蒋匪经此沉重打击，全线震动，手忙脚乱，洛阳一夕数惊，西安正准备巷战。黄河北岸晋南蒋匪相继放弃残余据点垣曲、坡头（孟县），而运城、临汾残匪亦正撤调。凡此皆证明我军由内线转入外线作战，不仅更有力的掀起蒋管区人民反蒋、反封建的斗争，而且更有效的保卫了解放区。蒋匪在此战役中破绽百出，表示其已面临崩溃。其中最显著的有三点：第一、是士气日益萎靡。新一旅为蒋匪战斗力较强部队，但经我一击，立即垮台，正副旅长以下五千余名悉被俘。他们对蒋贼坚持内战，充满悲观失望。陕县城由一三五旅及青年军一个营，三十六师野炮营，保安第一团防守，但经我总攻，三小时即全部就歼。历次战斗，我敌伤亡为一比十。第二、是指挥不灵，完全被动。部队调东调西，疲于奔命。各级指挥丧失信心，互相埋怨。新一旅下级官兵埋怨旅团指挥无能，黄永被他则骂胡宗南等为大混蛋。炮十一团榴弹炮连长胡振瀛则愤恨步兵掩护不力，使炮兵成了第一线。第三、是群众纪律的败坏，与民为敌。渑池解放之前，被蒋匪抢得一塌糊涂。陕县南关银行及商店数家，亦遭蒋匪洗劫。城南朱家楼等村，群众牲口衣被等都被抢光，群众对蒋匪此等暴行，无不切齿痛恨。凡此皆为蒋匪致命伤。蒋匪经此战役，其战略体系已被打乱，其与西北战场的联系亦已被切断，胡宗南匪帮的后方，暴露于我大军之前。今后豫西战场必将传出更多捷报。
