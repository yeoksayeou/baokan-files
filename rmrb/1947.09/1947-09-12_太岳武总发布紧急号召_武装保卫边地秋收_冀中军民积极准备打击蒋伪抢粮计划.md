    [This newspaper Taiyue, 11th dispatch] The Taiyue Military Sub-district issued an emergency appeal on the 7th of this month, requiring border area militiamen to rise up and arm themselves to defend the autumn harvest. The appeal stated: "The autumn harvest is approaching. Because the enemy's occupied areas are shrinking, they are acutely aware of the shortage of military grain and will carry out large-scale looting. Therefore, in many areas bordering the enemy in our district, the struggle to defend the autumn harvest this year will be more intense and sharper. Cadres and militiamen at all levels should be a hundred times more vigilant, prepare early, and fight to smash the enemy's looting conspiracy and resolutely defend the autumn harvest interests of the masses. According to the enemy's methods of robbing grain from our liberated areas over the years, they are no more than the following: (1) Concentrating forces and bringing heavy troops to the border to cover grain grabbing. (2) Establishing strongholds in our hinterland for short periods. (3) Small-scale harassment and looting. (4) Using village compilation for requisitioning. To this end, we hereby issue the following appeal to all militiamen and cadres in the border areas:
    (1) Conduct in-depth ideological mobilization, eliminate all ideas of underestimating the enemy and paralysis, and launch an independent and autonomous struggle to defend the autumn harvest. Cadres must take the lead, fighting and organizing the masses to harvest at the same time, organizing all able-bodied, semi-able-bodied women and children well on the front line of the autumn harvest, achieving quick harvesting, quick fighting, and quick hiding, doing everything to ensure the victorious completion of the autumn harvest, and striving to make contributions in the autumn harvest. (2) Universally launch a blasting offensive, which is the main means for us to defend the autumn harvest. In particular, mobilize the masses to bury mines in the places where they store grain and launch mass blasting, so that every household has mines and grain. If the enemy robs us of a grain, we will repay them with a drop of blood. This is an extremely important task for us to carry out the blasting offensive to defend the autumn harvest. At the same time, actively carry out flying blasting around the enemy's strongholds or on the necessary roads for attack, compressing the enemy into the strongholds. For temporary strongholds inserted into our hinterland, quickly turn to blockade and encirclement, cut off transportation, and combine political offensives to force the enemy to retreat or lay down their weapons. (3) Highly develop heart-digging tactics. Various localities can select bold, alert militiamen who have close ties with the masses to form heart-digging teams of different sizes, specializing in attacking or annihilating all the enemy's grain requisitioning agencies and personnel. All enemy and puppet grain requisitioning personnel should be dealt with as the chief culprits and resolutely suppressed. Strengthen joint defense organizations, establish combat discipline, and respond to each other in all directions when one place starts fighting, giving full play to the spirit of rural mutual assistance and discipline. (4) Each military sub-district can draw a part of the hinterland militia to support the border areas, defend the autumn harvest, and combine with the local militia and county brigades to strengthen the blockade and encirclement of the enemy's strongholds, becoming a strong backbone of the border area militia. After receiving this appeal, each military sub-district should organize discussions and quickly deploy, and from September 18th to the end of October, all militiamen and cadres in the border areas should strive for this task.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 10th dispatch] The autumn harvest has begun in various parts of Hebei-Central Region. Soldiers and civilians in the liberated areas are actively preparing to smash the plan of Chiang Kai-shek's puppet troops in Peking-Tientsin-Baoding to grab grain on a large scale. It is reported that the Chiang-controlled Hebei Provincial Senate had discussed grain grabbing in mid-August and attempted to seize 8,000 conscripts from Hebei-Central Region during the autumn harvest. Currently, militiamen in Qingyuan, Lixian, Wenan, and Xinzhen have organized joint autumn protection and defense, and villages have established armed autumn protection brigades. Another report: Baiyangdian has little water this summer, and the corn and indigo planted in the surrounding low-lying areas have had bumper harvests. Each acre of more than 2,000 acres of indigo can yield around 200 jin, and it is now being harvested. All the corn has been brought to the threshing ground.
