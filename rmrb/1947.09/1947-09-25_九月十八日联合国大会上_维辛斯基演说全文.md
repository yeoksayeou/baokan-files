Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, September 22nd: According to TASS, New York: At the United Nations General Assembly on the 18th, the head of the Soviet delegation, Vyshinsky, delivered a lengthy speech, condemning the US imperialism for undermining world peace and attempting to provoke a new war, demanding punishment for war propagandists around the world, and strongly declaring the Soviet Union's determination to defend world peace and the United Nations. He also elaborated on the Soviet Union's views on several major issues in the current international situation. These issues included the control of atomic energy and the necessary destruction of atomic bombs, the necessary implementation of disarmament, the principle of unanimity among the five permanent members of the Security Council which cannot be modified, not allowing the responsibility to be placed on Southern, Bulgarian and Albanian countries by so-called "Greek border disputes", the Korean issue cannot be resolved according to the unilateral views of US imperialism, all member states should strictly implement the resolution of the last General Assembly and sever diplomatic relations with the Spanish fascist government, and the trusteeship issues. Vyshinsky also listed facts, names, and names of monopoly groups to expose the propaganda of various countries' warmongers to provoke a new war, and condemned the actual activities of these elements in preparing for war. He demanded punishment for war propagandists around the world to stop all incitement of new wars. Finally, Vyshinsky sternly warned the warmongers that the Soviet Union did not want war and would resolutely fight to defend world peace, defend the United Nations, and shatter all conspiracies to incite a new war. The full text of Vyshinsky's speech is as follows:

    A year has passed since the First General Assembly; it is necessary to review what has been experienced in recent years, analyze the work done by the United Nations during this period, draw certain conclusions and point out possible prospects. Every delegation and every member state of the United Nations has an obligation to fulfill this duty fairly, and should be aware of the important responsibility it bears. This requires thorough clarity, impartiality, and respect for truth, which should be paramount. The Soviet delegation, looking back on the past, believes that it has a responsibility to point out that the work of the United Nations during this period has had serious shortcomings. These shortcomings should be resolutely exposed, and it should be specifically pointed out that these shortcomings mainly lie in deviating from the most important principles that form the basis of the United Nations organization, and sometimes even directly violating several important decisions of the United Nations General Assembly. These shortcomings are largely due to the fact that influential member states, such as the United States and the United Kingdom, attempt to use the United Nations organization to suit the interests of their small groups, while disregarding the interests of international cooperation based on the principles set forth in the United Nations Charter. The policy of various countries using the United Nations organization for their selfish and narrow interests has caused the United Nations to lose its prestige, just like the tragic memories of the League of Nations. On the other hand, the unsatisfactory situation within the United Nations, which harms the prestige of the United Nations, is the result of certain practical actions taken by the above-mentioned countries in disregard of this organization, and attempting to stand outside or above it. We must pay attention to the serious danger that the United Nations is now facing due to this policy, which is incompatible with the Charter and with the purposes and objectives declared by the united nations when the United Nations organization was established.
  
  US and UK oppose disarmament
    Among the major shortcomings in the affairs of the United Nations, it should first be pointed out that the progress in implementing the United Nations General Assembly's decision on universal disarmament on December 14, 1946, is unsatisfactory. The universal disarmament proposal was unanimously adopted at last year's conference. This proposal is in the interests of the masses of people of all nations in the world. However, despite the fact that the Second World War has long ended, they still bear the heavy burden of war expenses and the significant difficulties caused by the endless increase in armaments. At the same time, the decision of the General Assembly on universal disarmament is also an expression of the wishes and demands of peace-loving people to establish lasting peace and international security, and is an urgent demand caused by the suffering they have experienced and the sacrifices they have made. Because of this, the people of the world wholeheartedly accepted this decision and hoped that it could be quickly and fully implemented. However, this hope was not properly respected. When the Security Council and the General Armaments Commission attempted to formulate practical measures to implement the United Nations General Assembly's decision on universal restriction and reduction of armaments, the representatives of the United States and the United Kingdom proposed some conditions that would only hinder the implementation of the General Assembly's above-mentioned decision. All the activities of the US and UK delegations in the General Armaments Commission proved that the US and UK were opposed to reducing armaments, opposed to disarmament, and hindered disarmament, thus arousing the vigilance of all peace-loving countries. Bevin's statement in South Port that he had no intention of assisting disarmament is a powerful answer to the question of why the implementation of the disarmament decision is unsatisfactory. Truman's recent speech in Pedro Polis (Brazil) also revealed the same intention. The US President at that time strongly stated that the US army would be maintained and did not mention a word about the obligation to implement disarmament, which, according to the decision of the General Assembly, is an obligation that the united nations should undertake. As we have said, the attitude of the United States and the United Kingdom on the issue of disarmament, and the lack of positive results in the implementation of the tasks stipulated in the resolution of December 14, 1946, naturally caused people to have legitimate vigilance and concern about whether our initiated cause can succeed. And the arms race (including atomic weapons), the war-mongering preparations of certain countries with huge military and economic power, make this vigilance and worry even more intense. This situation damages people's confidence in the sincerity of peace declarations and statements that are determined to save future generations from the scourge of war.

  The United States opposes the prohibition of atomic weapons
    Millions of people are particularly alarmed by the unsatisfactory situation of the prohibition of atomic and other weapons with massive destructive power. This alarm is even more obvious because atomic weapons are offensive weapons and aggressive weapons. The Atomic Energy Commission has been working for a year and a half, but none of the tasks stipulated in the United Nations General Assembly resolution of January 24, 1946, have been completed, and there has been no progress in implementing this resolution. The Soviet government has taken many steps to help actively resolve this issue. In order to enrich and develop its proposed international convention on the prohibition of atomic and other weapons with massive destructive power, the Soviet government has submitted to the AEC for consideration its proposals on the main principles of international control of atomic energy. However, this proposal was mainly opposed by the United States. The United States attempted to maintain its monopoly on atomic weapons, and opposed all advice on destroying its stockpiled atomic bombs and prohibiting the continued manufacture of atomic bombs. At the same time, it has consistently expanded the production of atomic bombs. The differences among the member states of the AEC in this regard have hindered the work of the AEC and made it impossible for the AEC to make any efforts to effectively resolve this issue. However, if some delegations, including the US delegation, dealt with this issue in a more impartial manner, many differences could undoubtedly have been eliminated long ago. For example, the Soviet delegation suggested that after the convention prohibiting atomic weapons comes into effect, all existing stockpiles of atomic bombs should be destroyed; the possibility of eliminating differences in this regard should have existed long ago. As is well known, most member states of the AEC have agreed in principle that it is necessary to destroy stockpiles of atomic weapons, and the atomic nuclear fuel contained therein can only be used for peaceful purposes. Only the US delegation insisted on opposing the destruction of atomic bomb stockpiles, thereby making it impossible for the AEC to pass a decision on this issue that was favored by the majority. The situation caused by the supervision issue is also worth noting. Until recently, the US delegation still emphasized the particular importance of the supervision issue. In the Soviet delegation's proposal, supervision is also a basic measure after the prohibition of atomic weapons. However, the US delegation has now suddenly begun to reduce the significance of supervision and proposed putting other issues, such as the transfer of atomic factories to international institutions for ownership, management, and registration, in the first place. The US delegation thus refused to consider the opinions of qualified scientists, such as those put forward in the memorandum of the British Atomic Scientists Association Committee, which includes famous figures in the scientific community, who opposed the international regulatory agency's ownership of atomic energy production tools. As is well known, British scientists emphasized in the memorandum that giving this agency full ownership of production tools in the usual sense would inevitably cause difficulties. Because this will give the atomic energy regulatory agency the power to decide whether a country has the right to build an atomic energy plant, whether it has the right to stop the use of atomic energy produced by these plants, or to stipulate the terms for supplying this atomic energy. British scientists correctly criticized the principles that the US delegation has insisted on since Baruch took office, saying that this restriction would create opportunities to interfere in the economic life of each country to an extent that is unnecessary to prevent atomic energy from being applied to destructive purposes. This is the opinion of scientists who consider this issue from the perspective of scientific progress. And scientific progress is incompatible with the unlimited control of scientific research by a certain centralized international institution. The reason why the British atomic scientists' memorandum advocates the following plan lies in this: on the one hand, it stipulates guarantees to prevent the accumulation of dangerous materials without the permission of the atomic energy regulatory agency, and at the same time allows countries to have their initiative in establishing plants for producing atomic energy in their own countries in addition to other power resources. In order to consolidate universal peace, the Soviet Union suggested concluding a convention to prohibit the use of atomic weapons in any situation. The Soviet Union's suggestion received a wide response and support from various countries. The British Scientists Association's memorandum stated that this convention seemed very appropriate. And it stated that it is difficult for Britain and France to find any reason not to agree to this convention. Regarding the Soviet Union's request to destroy existing atomic weapons stockpiles and stop their continued manufacture, British scientists wrote that they thought this request was very reasonable; the Soviet Union is in favor of strict international control over atomic energy plants, however, it should not develop into interfering in the industrial sectors of the national economy that are not related to atomic energy, and interfering in matters that are not related to atomic energy. In a memorandum published on January 23, British atomic scientists expressed their hope that the scope of supervision should be limited as much as possible, and that it should not become a tool for expressing excessive curiosity about certain legitimate industries and other activities, which is also correct. In a memorandum published in August, British scientists once again pointed out that the exact scope of supervision must be stipulated so that it does not serve as an organized economic and military intelligence work. The memorandum pointed out that the United States and other followers of the Baruch plan should be persuaded to make guarantees to determine a situation in which no supervision plan would become a thorough and precise set of espionage work.

    Starting from the above-mentioned principles of international control institutions, I would like to say again that this international control institution should be truly powerful and effective. The Soviet delegation believes that certain scopes must be stipulated for the supervision institution, and their powers should be limited to truly controlling atomic energy and preventing the control institution from being used as a possibility of arbitrarily interfering in any sector of the national economy; regardless of whether this interference can only damage and destroy the national economies of other countries. The US delegation and certain other delegations that support it, particularly insist that all factories that produce dangerous amounts of atomic materials should be possessed and managed by the international control institution, so the control institution becomes the owner, and this owner will act for the benefit of some members of this institution. The Soviet Union cannot expect them to have goodwill towards the Soviet Union. What the delegations that are active around the US delegation and acting according to the instructions of the US are trying to gain is precisely this situation. The memorandum of the British scientists quoted above reveals that the US atomic energy control plan predetermines measures that can be interpreted as the permanent domination of the United States in the field of atomic energy. The Soviet delegation now and in the future opposes this situation and will insist that the international control institution should not be dominated by any one country but by all countries participating in the institution, and should enjoy equal rights in all activities of the institution. Regarding this point, we should also recall that the American representatives to the Atomic Energy Commission stubbornly opposed the simultaneous establishment of control over all stages of atomic manufacturing (from refining raw materials to making finished products). The American representatives suggested indefinitely delaying the establishment of control over the final stage of atomic production, which is the most dangerous, and the United States believes that it is currently the monopolist in this regard. At the same time, they insisted on immediately implementing control over the preliminary stage (that is, the stage of refining raw materials). It is very clear that the US attitude can only be interpreted as its purpose is to prevent control from being extended to the United States, while all other countries must immediately submit to international control.

    This is the situation regarding the atomic energy issue.

    People naturally cannot expect the success of that undertaking, in which some delegations do not intend to cooperate in order to achieve the goals set in the UN General Assembly resolution of December 14 of last year. We cannot tolerate this situation, nor can we allow the threat of using atomic energy for mass destruction and the annihilation of peaceful residents to remain uneliminated. Despite the calls of the United Nations organization to ban atomic weapons and other major weapons that massively destroy humankind, the production of tools for mass destruction is not only continuing, but also expanding day by day, and the conscience of the people of the world cannot ignore this situation.

    九月十八日联合国大会上
    维辛斯基演说全文
    【新华社陕北二十二日电】据塔斯社纽约讯：十八日之联合国大会上，苏代表团团长维辛斯基发表长篇演说，谴责美帝国主义破坏世界和平企图挑拨新战争，要求惩办全世界的战争宣传分子，力申苏联保卫世界和平保卫联合国的决心；并阐述苏联对当前国际局势中若干重大问题的意见。这些问题包括原子能的管制与原子弹的必须毁灭，裁减军备的必须执行，安理会中五强一致原则之不能修改，不容许借所谓“希腊边境纠纷事件”将责任加在南、保、阿三国身上，朝鲜问题不能按照美帝国主义单方面意见解决，各会员国应当严格执行上次大会决议与西班牙法西斯政府绝交，以及托管问题等等。维氏并列举事实、人名、独占集团名字，以揭露各国战争贩子之挑拨新战争的宣传；责斥这些分子准备战争的实际活动。要求惩办全世界的战争宣传分子，制止新战争的一切煽动。最后，维氏严正警告战争贩子，苏联不要战争，并要坚决为保卫世界和平，保卫联合国，粉碎一切煽动新战争的阴谋而斗争。维氏演说全文如下：
    自第一届大会以来已历时一年；回顾年来所经历的种种，分析这一时期内联合国所作的工作，作出某些结论并指出可能的前途，实属必要。每一代表团，每一联合国会员国均有公正履行这个职责的义务，且应自觉到本身对此所负的重大责任。为此需要彻底的明晰性，大公无私，以及尊崇真理，真理应该是至高无上的。苏联代表团回顾既往，认为有责任指出，这段时期的联合国工作是有严重的缺点的，这些缺点应予坚决不渝的揭发，并具体指明这些缺点主要的在于背离了作为联合国组织基础的最重要的原则，有时甚至直接违犯了联合国大会的若干重要决定。这些缺点，大部份由于如象美英等有影响的会员国，企图利用联合国组织适合其狭小集团的利益，而漠视联合国宪章所提示之原则为依据的国际合作的利益。各国为其自私与狭隘利益而利用联合国组织的政策，使联合国丧失其威信，一如人们悲惨的回忆中的国际联盟的情形一样。另一方面，联合国内有损联合国威信的不能令人满意的状况，乃是上述国家漠视这一组织，并企图站在这组织之外，或驾凌其上而作的某些实际行动的结果。我们必须注意联合国现正面临着这种政策所造成的严重危险，这种政策与宪章、与联合国组织成立时联合国家所揭示的宗旨与目的是不能并容的。
  美英反对裁军
    在联合国事务各项重大的缺点中，首先应该指出，一九四六年十二月十四日联合国大会实施普遍裁军决定之进程未能令人满意。普遍裁军案在去年大会上得到一致通过，此项提案符合全世界各族人民大众的利益，可是尽管二次大战早已结束，他们仍肩负着战费的重担与无休止增加军备所引起的重大困难。同时，大会普遍裁军的决定，也是爱好和平人民建立持久和平与国际安全的愿望与要求的表示，是因他们所经历的痛苦与所付出的牺牲而引起的迫切要求的表示。正因为如此，全世界人民衷心满意地接受这个决定，并希望其能迅速全部实现。然而这个希望并未被正当尊重，当安理会与普遍军备委员会内企图拟订实施联合国大会之普遍限制与缩减军备决定的实际办法时，美国与英国代表即提出一些只会妨碍实施大会上述决定的条件。美、英两国代表团在普通军备委员会中的一切活动，都证明美、英两国是反对缩减军备，反对裁军，阻挠裁军，因而引起各爱好和平国家之警惕。贝文在南港声明他并无协助裁军的打算，对于缩军决定之执行为什么不能令人满意的疑问，这就是有力的回答。杜鲁门最近在贝德罗保利斯（巴西）的演说，也透露出同样的意图，美国总统当时力称美国军队将予保持，并无只字提及实施参军的义务，这义务依照大会决定是联合国家应担承的。如我们所说过的，美、英两国对裁军问题的这种态度，与执行一九四六年十二月十四日决议案所规定的任务未有积极的成果，自然引起了人民对于我们所发起的这一事业之能否成功，发生正当的警觉与忧虑。而军备的竞赛（包括原子武器在内），拥有庞大军事与经济力量的某些国家的好战的准备，使这种警觉与忧虑更形紧张。这种情形损害着人们对于决心要使后代子孙免除战争灾祸的和平宣言与声明之真诚性的信心。
  美国反对禁止原子武器
    成千百万人民对于禁止具有大规模破坏力的原子及其他武器的不能令人满意的情况，特别感到警觉，此种警觉由于原子武器是进攻的武器，侵略的武器，而更加明显了。原子能委员会工作已达一年半，但一九四六年一月二十四日联合国大会决议中所规定的任务，没有一件完成，而且在执行这一决议中毫无进展。苏联政府方面曾采取许多步骤帮助这一问题的积极解决。苏联政府为充实并发展其所建议的缔结关于禁止具有大规模破坏力的原子及其他武器的国际公约计，曾提请原委会审议其关于国际管制原子能主要原则的建议。然而这建议主要遭到美国方面的反对。美国企图保持其对于原子武器的独占，反对一切关于毁灭其所存积的原子弹及禁止原子弹的继续制造的劝告。同时，并一贯地扩大原子弹的生产。原委会各会员国在这方面的分歧，阻碍了原委会的工作，并使原委会对这问题负责有效解决的一切努力无法进行。然而，假如某些代表团，包括美代表团在内，以较公正的方式处理这一问题，许多分歧无疑的早就能够消除。例如，苏代表团建议，在禁止原子武器公约生效之后，毁灭一切现有的原子弹存货；在这方面的分歧，早就该有消除的可能。如所周知，原委会大多数会员国在原则上曾同意需要毁灭原子武器存货，其中所含之原子核燃料仅能用于和平的目的。只有美代表团一国坚持反对毁灭原子弹的存货，从而使原委会中对这问题无法通过为大多数赞成的决定。因监督问题所引起的情势，也值得注意。直到不久前，美国代表团仍强调监督问题的特别重要性。苏代表团的建议中，监督也为禁止原子武器之后的基本措施。然而，美代表团现在突然开始减轻监督的意义，并提出把其他问题。例如原子工厂移交国际机构所有、管理、登记证等问题，放在第一位。美国代表团就这样来拒绝考虑有资格的科学家的意见，如象拥有科学界名人的英国原子科学家协会委员会之备忘录中所提出的，他们反对国际管制机构享有原子能生产工具所有权。如所周知，英国科学家在备忘录中强调指出，使此一机构享有通常意义上的生产工具的充分所有权，势必引起困难。因为这将赋予原子能管制机构以这种权力：决定某国是否有权建立原子能工厂，是否有权制止利用此等工厂所生产的原子能，或规定供应此种原子能的条款。英国科学家正确地批评自巴鲁区就任以来美代表团所坚持的原则称，这种限制会造成干涉每一国经济生活的机会，以至于超出为防止原子能应用于破坏目的所不必要的程度。这是从科学进步的利益之角度考虑这一问题的科学家的意见。而科学的进步，是与某种集权的国际机构对于科学研究加以无限的管制不相容的。这种科学研究是为和平目的而发展并增加能量的供应的。英国原子科学家的备忘录主张下述计划理由即在于此，这个计划即：一方面规定保证制止未经原子能管制机构允许而积累危险物资，同时又使各国能在各该国境内除其他动力资源外建立生产原子能的工厂方面有其主动性。为了巩固普遍的和平，苏联建议缔结公约，以禁止在任何情形下使用原子武器。苏联这个建议获得各国的广泛响应与支持。英国科学家协会的备忘录称，这种公约似乎非常适当。并称，英国及法国很难找出不愿同意这一公约的任何理由。对于苏联毁灭现成原子武器存货并停止其继续制造的要求，英国科学家写道，他们认为这要求非常合理；苏联赞成对原子能工厂予以严格的国际管制，然而，它不应发展为干涉国民经济中与原子能无关的工业部门，干涉与原子能无关的事情。英国原子科学家在一月二十三日发表的备忘录中表示，希望监督权应尽可能有所限制，并且它不应变成对某些合法工业及其他活动表示过分好奇心的工具，这也是正确的。在八月间发表的备忘录中，英国科学家再度指出，必须规定监督权的确切范围，使其不致充任有组织的经济与军事情报工作。备忘录指出，应当说服美国及其他各巴鲁区计划的追随者，使他们作出保证，确定一种情势，其中任何监督计划都不致变成澈头澈尾精密的一套谍报工作。
    从上述国际管制机构的原则出发，我再说一遍，这个国际管制机构应该是真正强有力的和有效的，苏联代表团认为对于监督机构必须规定某些范围，他们的权力应仅限于真正的管制原子能，并防止管制机构被用作任意干涉国民经济的任何部门的可能性；姑无论这种干涉只能损害及毁灭其他国家的国民经济。美国代表团以及支持它的某些其他代表团，特别坚持主张所有生产危险数量的原子物资的工厂应由国际管制机构占有和管理，因此管制机构就变成了所有者，而这个所有者就将为了这一机构若干会员的利益而活动。苏联不能期望他们会对苏联有善意的态度。在美国代表团周围，并依照美国的指示而活动的各代表团所力图争取的正是这种情势。上面引过的英科学家的备忘录揭露出：美国的原子能管制计划预先规定了可以被解释为美国在原子能领域中的永久统治权的措施。苏代表团现在和将来都反对这种情势，并将坚持主张国际管制机构不应由任何一国而应由所有参加该机构的各国所统治，在该机构一切活动中应享平等权利。关于这点我们还应追叙：原子能委员会的美国代表们固执地反对同时建立对原子制造的各个阶段（自提炼原料到制成成品）的管制。美国代表们建议无限期地拖延建立对原子生产最有危险性的最后阶段的管制，美国认为她在目前是这方面的独占者。同时，他们坚持立即实行对初步阶段（即提炼原料阶段）的管制。十分清楚，美国的态度只能被解释为其目的在阻止把管制引伸到美国身上去，而其他一切国家却要立即服从国际的管制。
    这就是关于原子能问题的情势。
    人们自然不能预期那种事业的成功，某些代表团在其中不打算合作以达成去年十二月十四日联大决议中所定的目的。我们不能容忍这种情势，也不能对利用原子能作大量破坏及毁灭和平居民的威胁迄今尚未消除一事，听其自然。尽管联合国机构呼吁禁止原子武器及其他大量毁灭人类的主要武器，而用作大量破坏的工具的生产，不仅仍在继续，且在日益扩大，全世界人民的良知不能置此种情势于不问。（未完待续）
