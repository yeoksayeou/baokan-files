    Captured Chiang Army Officers from Yangshan Village
    See the Bright and Happy Liberated Area
    Realize It's Shameful to Work for Chiang
    [Our Newspaper's Report] After living in the liberated area for more than 20 days, the Chiang army officers of the 66th Division, who were liberated in the Battle of Yangshan Village, said, "What we have seen and felt is like waking up from a dream and suddenly realizing the truth." (As the division's chief of military affairs, Wang Shijie, wrote in his autobiography). What did they realize? Their deputy chief of staff, Wang Kaishi, wrote: "Having personally experienced the countryside, I have seen that land reform is very thorough. Compared with the Kuomintang-controlled areas, the former is like heaven, and the latter is like hell, a far cry from each other. I have come to realize that Chiang Kai-shek is ruining the country and harming the people, and my years of military service have been in vain! ... I am not a landlord or capitalist, but I have been fighting for landlords and capitalists. What could be more shameful!" These officers, who fought for landlords and bureaucrat-comprador capitalists, all stated in their autobiographies that they "have always been dissatisfied with the Kuomintang and hated Chiang Kai-shek; they deeply know that the country and the nation will be lost by him." Thus, they all lost their fighting spirit and "could only lament helplessly." Guo Shouxin, the director of the 66th Division's newsroom, after scolding the "scramble for profit from top to bottom" and the "rampant desires" of the Kuomintang-controlled areas in his autobiography, wrote: "The troops are separated from the people and have no will to fight. Chiang Kai-shek disregards everything and fights only for his own selfish dictatorship. I know this very well, but I can only lament helplessly. During the Yangshan campaign, before laying down my weapons, I squatted in the room day and night, doing nothing. Because of this, I was often reprimanded by my superiors for not doing anything and looked at coldly..." What is the liberated area like? They wrote that they were "often misled by Kuomintang propaganda and did not understand it very well." After seeing it with their own eyes and experiencing it firsthand, even the division commander and pioneer of the civil war, Song Ruike, wrote: "Land to the tiller has been thoroughly implemented. The people in the liberated areas have sufficient food and clothing and voluntarily participate in the patriotic self-defense war." As for Chiang Kai-shek, he also said: "For more than 20 years, he has been chanting about the Three People's Principles, but he is still killing his own compatriots. Judging from the current government's corruption and various measures, it is only protecting the interests of a few privileged classes, and the suffering of the people has not been alleviated in the slightest." He even said that he was "guilty and unforgivable and deeply repented." His chief of staff, Guo Yulin, even scolded, "From the National Government (Chiang's government) to the township and bao offices, every level is full of corrupt officials and bureaucrats. Honest civil servants cannot support their families on their salaries, and we often hear of civil servants and university professors committing suicide." In the Chiang government, "a few bureaucrats are wealthy people." Bureaucrats, compradores, and profiteers are making war fortunes, victory fortunes, acceptance fortunes, and civil war fortunes, while the majority of the people are suffering from war, victory, and civil war, leading to rice looting everywhere and arson everywhere—workers striking, students boycotting classes, and merchants closing their shops. Moreover, due to extremely heavy taxation and emergency conscription, farmers are idling in the fields, and fields are barren... Now, even the army is gradually going on strike." Tu Huantao, the commander of the 185th Brigade, said: "Unless the corrupt machine of the Chiang regime is completely overthrown, the Chinese people will not be able to turn over!" Luo Yusheng, the commander of the 553rd Regiment, who joined the army in the high tide of the Great Revolution of 1925, also realized that "the so-called 'revolutionary camp' in the past was actually a selfish bureaucratic group. The real revolutionary camp is the Eighth Route Army in the liberated areas." He "is fortunate to have jumped out of the civil war pit and is determined to abandon the dark and turn to the light, to learn and work on the revolutionary line that truly represents the interests of the people."

    羊山集被俘蒋军军官
    看到我区光明康乐
    觉悟为蒋卖命可耻
    【本报讯】羊山集战斗中被解放的蒋军六十六师军官们，在解放区住了二十多天后，“见闻所及，感想所至，实如大梦方醒，恍然大悟。”（该师军务处长王时杰在他的自传里这样写）。悟到了什么呢？他们的副参谋长王开石写道：“亲历农村，见土地改革十分彻底，与蒋管区相较，前者如天堂，后者如地狱，相去甚远。始悟蒋介石丧权误国残害人民，二十余年来我之戎马奔走毫无是处！……我非大地主资本家，乃竟为大地主资本家而战，可耻孰甚！”这些为大地主及官僚买办资本家而战的军官们，在自传里都表示自己“向不满意国民党，痛恨蒋介石；深知国家民族必被其送掉。”于是就都丧失了斗志而“徒唤奈何”。六十六师新闻室主任郭守信在自传里骂了一顿“上下交征利”、“人欲横流”的蒋管区后，写着：“部队离开民众，毫无战志，而蒋介石一切不顾，只为自私独裁而战，心甚知之，徒唤奈何。于羊山之役在未放下武器前，日夜蹲踞室内，无所事事。因之常被主官斥责不做事，冷眼睨视……”解放区究竟怎样？他们写着是“常被国民党宣传误会，不甚明了”。亲眼看到、亲身体验了以后，连该师师长内战先锋宋瑞珂也写下：“耕者有其田已彻底实行，解放区人民家给人足，自动起来参加爱国自卫战争。”而蒋介石呢，他也说是：“口喊实行三民主义已二十余年，今仍残杀自己同胞。以目前政府之贪污腐化种种措施观之，实仅为保护少数特权阶级之利益，对人民之痛苦未解除半点。”而连称自己“罪不容恕，痛自忏悔”。他的参谋长郭雨林更痛骂“自国民政府（蒋府）以至乡保公所，层层级级都是贪官污吏，本分的公务员靠薪俸养不起家，时常听到有公务员、大学教授自杀的事。”而蒋政府内“少数官僚则是富家翁。”官僚们、买办们、奸商们，则发国难财、发胜利财、发接受财、发内战财，大多数的人民则受国难苦、受胜利苦、受内战苦，以致到处抢米，到处放火——工人罢工、学生罢课、商人罢市。又因，征税奇重，与紧急征兵，以致农罢于野，田园荒芜。……现在则军队也要渐渐的罢战了。”一八五旅旅长涂焕陶说：“非把蒋政权这架腐败的机器完全推翻，中国人民是无法翻身的！”在一九二五大革命高潮时入伍的五五三团团长罗玉胜，也晓得了“过去所谓‘革命阵营’，实系自私自利的官僚集团而已。真正的革命阵营是在解放区的八路军。”他“庆幸自己跳出内战火坑，决心弃暗投明，向真正代表人民利益的革命路线学习工作。”（铮）
