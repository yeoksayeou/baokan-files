　　Taihang Second District Counties Turn the Soil, Prepare Fertilizer, and Repair Farm Tools; Heshun and Zuoquan Begin Sowing
    [This newspaper's Taihang News] In order to compensate for the losses caused by the poor harvest and to survive the period before the next summer harvest, the counties in the Second District, in conjunction with eliminating cultivated wasteland, have formulated plans to expand wheat fields. The entire district plans to expand wheat fields by 240,000 mu, bringing the total area of wheat fields, including those harvested in the summer, to 974,000 mu. Currently, all counties are making every effort to carry out all preparatory work. Heshun and Zuoquan, where the climate is cold, have already started sowing. In Heshun's Fourth District, under the leadership of labor hero Wang Zhanyuan, 5,412 mu have already been sown. In the Fifth District, Hengling has sown more than 100 mu, with plans for each person to sow seven fen of wheat. Yangquanling in Yushe proposed the slogan: "Plant one more mu of wheat this year, and overcome two months of famine next year." The entire village has achieved an average of 1.5 mu per person. The wheat fields have already been plowed twice, and there are plans to plow them once more. According to statistics from 42 villages in Wuxiang, including Hongshui, Yabi, and Fenshuiling, 5,410 mu of wasteland have been eliminated in conjunction with wheat planting. Except for a small portion of land used for late crops and vegetables, the remainder is used as wheat fields. In Dachi Village, Xiangyuan's Fourth District, the masses in Zhao Jiayan pooled their resources to buy 14 livestock in four or five days, widely achieving three plows. Currently, all counties in the entire district are intensively carrying out all preparatory work such as turning the soil, preparing fertilizer, collecting seeds, repairing farm tools, and repairing field borders and bunds, preparing to sow with all their strength.
    [Another dispatch] In order to widely promote 169 wheat, Zhuanjian specifically transferred 250 shi of 169 selected seeds from Xiangyuan, allocating them with a focus to Heshun, Xiyang, Shouyang, and Wuxiang. Currently, Heshun and Shouyang set off to Xiangyuan on the 26th and 27th to collect wheat, preparing to sow as early as possible. (Pi Yu, Xinghua)
