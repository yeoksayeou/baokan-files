　　Ji County Party Committee Instructions
  　Harvest Whichever Plot is Ripe, Vacate That Land to Plant Wheat
    [This newspaper, Jinan, 10th dispatch] The Ji County Party Committee instructed all districts and villages to organize the masses to help each other with the rush harvest and wheat planting. In villages without mutual aid, this work should be used to organize voluntary combinations for temporary mutual aid in the rush harvest, so as to "harvest whichever plot is ripe, and vacate that land to plant wheat." A widespread comparison and inspection campaign should be launched during the harvest to see who harvests more and harvests better. For wheat planting, emphasize plowing and harrowing the land early to ensure deep plowing and fine harrowing, no weeds, a level surface, and more fertilizer application, to enrich the land. Use the actual examples of more wheat being harvested with more fertilizer and less wheat being harvested with less fertilizer from the past to educate the masses. The entire county is now actively organizing forces, and will go all out to rush planting at that time, striving to complete one-third of the county's cultivated land area with wheat planting.

　　冀县县委会指示
  　那块熟了收那块腾出地来好种麦
    【本报冀南十日电】冀县县委会指示各区村，组织群众互助抢收、种麦。没有互助的村，要通过这一工作组织，自愿结合，临时互助抢收，作到“那块熟了收那块，腾出地来好种麦”。在收割中普遍展开对比检查运动，看看谁收的多、收的好。种麦，强调早把地犁耙妥当，作到深耕细耙，没有草，地面平，多积肥多上粪，把地上的壮壮的。拿过去粪多收麦多，上粪少收麦少的实际例子去教育群众。现全县正在积极组织力量，届时全力突击下种，争取全县完成种麦达三分之一的耕地面积。
