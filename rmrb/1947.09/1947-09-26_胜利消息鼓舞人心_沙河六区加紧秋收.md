    Victory News Inspires People:
    Shahe Sixth District Speeds Up Autumn Harvest
    [Report from our newspaper in Shahe] The autumn harvest campaign in the Sixth District of Shahe began on September 8th and 9th. After seven days, with the exception of Gaozhuang and Hanzhuang, where most of the black beans and sorghum have not yet been harvested, and Fuyi, Xuzhuang, and Shangxian, which were planted late due to hail, the millet in most villages has been harvested, leaving only a small amount of sesame, mung beans, and sorghum. These villages have started plowing the land during the autumn harvest. In Zhongwang, Zhengzhao, and other villages, the dry land has been plowed three times. Fifteen to twenty percent of the millet stubble land in the district has been plowed. This year's autumn harvest is organized and is twice as fast as in previous years. On September 19th, cadres from the district held a meeting to summarize several key experiences: (1) Deepening leadership style: District and village cadres overcame the past practice of standing outside of mutual aid and issuing orders, allowing the masses to organize mutual aid, and engaging in equal value and equal work styles. Generally, cadres have gone deep into mutual aid groups, gaining understanding of the opinions of the masses regarding equal value, wages, labor utilization, and work arrangements at any time and have resolved them in a timely manner. (2) Promoting the enthusiasm of the masses and launching an emulation campaign: Villages, groups, and individuals have all formulated competition plans and conditions, which are also combined with the meritorious service campaign. The villages have also promptly commended model individuals, which has effectively led the laggards forward. In particular, Nanwang Village publicized the news of our army's southward advance to the masses, which further inspired the enthusiasm of the masses. (3) Mobilizing and organizing auxiliary labor, having women and children do work, and supporting the able-bodied: this slogan has played a significant role in the autumn harvest campaign, especially the use of female labor, which has been relatively common in various villages. (4) Division of labor and rational use of labor: This is a major development in this year's autumn harvest mutual aid. In general, women are harvesting millet, children are cutting millet ears, and men are plowing the stubble land. The rational allocation and use of all labor has greatly shortened the autumn harvest time. After summarizing the achievements and experiences, the next stage of work was discussed. In addition to a few villages continuing to harvest, most villages are focusing on plowing to prepare for wheat planting. Most of this can be completed around August 15th.

    胜利消息鼓舞人心
    沙河六区加紧秋收
    【本报沙河讯】沙河六区秋收运动，自九月八、九两日开始，经过七天时间，除高庄、韩庄，多是黑豆高粱还未大收，和福益、许庄、上贤因受雹灾种的晚，也还没有大收外，其他大部村庄谷子已经割完，只留下少数的芝麻、绿豆、高粱等。这些村庄在秋收中开始了犁地，中汪、郑招等村的垡旱地已犁过三遍，全区谷茬地已犁了的有百分之十五至二十。今年的秋收因为是组织起来，都比往年快了一倍。九月十九日全区干部开会，总结了几点经验：（一）领导作风深入：区村干部克服了过去站在互助以外的发号施令让群众组织互助，搞等价等作风，一般干部都深入到了互助里边，对于等价、工资、使用劳力、活的安排都能随时了解群众的意见，并及时的得到了解决。（二）发扬群众的积极性、掀起了竞赛运动：村与村、组与组、人与人都订出了竞赛计划和条件，更结合了立功运动，各村又及时的表扬了模范，这样好的把落后的就带领起来了。特别是南汪村向群众宣传了我军南下的胜利消息，更鼓舞了群众的情绪。（三）发动和组织辅助劳力，妇女儿童做活，顶住青壮年，这个口号在秋收运动中起了极大的作用，特别是妇女劳力，各村都比较普遍的运用起来。（四）分工与合理使用劳力：这是今年秋收互助中的一个大发展。一般村都是妇女割谷，儿女切谷穗，男人做茬犁地。合理的分配和使用了所有劳力，大大的缩短了秋收时间。总结了成绩和经验后，又讨论下段工作，除了少数村庄继续进行收割外，大部村庄是全力突击犁地，准备种麦。到八月十五前后就可大部完成。（高谦、高孟、高林）
