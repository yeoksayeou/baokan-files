Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 11th - Comprehensive report: While Chiang Kai-shek deliberately breached dikes to flood the liberated areas, he was also frantically creating and deepening the disasters of the people in the Chiang-controlled areas. According to incomplete statistics, since this summer, the Chiang-controlled areas have experienced various disasters such as floods, droughts, and locusts, covering fifteen provinces including Guangdong, Guangxi, Sichuan, Hunan, Hubei, Fujian, Jiangsu, Anhui, Henan, Hebei, Shanxi, Gansu, Suiyuan, Taiwan, and Northeast Liaoning. Among them, floods are the most common, especially in Guangdong and Guangxi. In Guangdong, 70 out of 101 counties and cities reported disasters, affecting approximately five million people, with eight million mu of farmland flooded, and a total grain loss of more than 18 million shi. It is estimated that the autumn harvest this year will not exceed 20% at best. As for the Guangxi floods, by July 14th, 56 counties had reported disasters, exceeding half of the province's 104 counties and cities. Three million mu of farmland were destroyed, affecting 1.7 million people. In the worst-hit counties, the disaster area accounted for nearly 94%. In Guangxi Province, at least 20,000 people have died. Secondly, in the Chiang-controlled area of ​​Liaoning, from late July, river embankments collapsed, and farmland was almost completely flooded, with the most serious being Shenyang, Liaoyang, Liaozhong, Xinmin, Tieling, Fushun, Benxi, Haicheng, and Yingkou counties. In Haicheng County, 2.5 million mu out of 3.08 million mu of cultivated land have been flooded. The wheat harvest in all counties is hopeless. In addition, water disasters have also occurred in 18 counties in Sichuan, 50 counties in Hubei, 13 counties in Hunan, 7 counties in northern Jiangsu, and various places in Fujian, Fuzhou, and southeastern Anhui.

Henan's disasters include drought, locusts, and hailstorms. The affected areas cover Neixiang, Zhenping, Nanyang, Tanghe in southern Henan, Luoyang, Yichuan in western Henan, Fugou, Huaiyang in eastern Henan, as well as Zhengzhou, Zhongmu, Xishui, and Jiaxian. In Nanyang County alone, the loss of crops reached more than 560,000 mu. In Hebei, there are more than 30 drought-stricken counties, with more than 1.9 million disaster victims in the Tianjin-Peiping area. In addition, the drought near Taiyuan in Shanxi, the water, locusts, and hailstorms in Suiyuan, and the hailstorms in Lanzhou and other places in Gansu are all extremely serious.

Based on the above materials, it is estimated that the disaster-stricken cultivated land area in the entire Chiang-controlled area reaches tens of millions of mu, and the number of disaster victims is approximately 20 million or more.

The spread and severity of these disasters are inseparable from Chiang Kai-shek's brutal and corrupt rule and the initiation and expansion of the civil war. This year's Suiyuan floods, newspapers in Zhangjiakou and Peiping pointed out that this was not a natural disaster, but a "man-made disaster" (i.e., Chiang's disaster), because Chiang and Fu's endless conscription and plunder not only left the fields barren, but also left no one to repair dikes and dams, or cut down trees and dig dikes, thus causing the floods. According to the Central News Agency, the Ma'anshan (dike name) in Huiyang, Guangdong, which was completed in May this year, has been destroyed in several places by floods due to the Chiang family's water conservancy organs' embezzlement of project funds, corruption, and cutting corners, arousing accusations from all sides. In addition, in the Luan County area of ​​eastern Hebei, before this summer's drought, the phenomenon of people abandoning their land rather than cultivating it due to excessive burdens had become widespread. In the Xinxiang area of ​​northern Henan, many farmers also abandoned their land and fled, leaving the countryside almost empty. Once a disaster strikes, the people have no choice but to wait for death.

After the disasters occurred, Chiang Kai-shek not only did not provide relief to the victims, but continued to attack the disaster-stricken people. Of the more than 2.1 million tons of UNRRA relief supplies shipped to China, 98.47% went to Chiang Kai-shek, but most of the relief supplies were used to support Chiang Kai-shek's anti-people civil war and fell into the pockets of the four major families and their servants, which has become an open secret. As early as February this year, the New York Afternoon Post pointed out in its editorial: "This government, which cannot survive without stealing the money of its own people, is a parasite that survives by driving the whole country towards a suicidal system. UNRRA's supplies must no longer be used in other areas through the incredibly greedy hands of Chiang Kai-shek's regime."

Not only that, Chiang Kai-shek added fuel to the fire amidst the widespread disasters and issued the criminal "General Mobilization Order" for the civil war against the will of the people, further forcing the people in the Chiang-controlled areas to provide grain, money, and lives. Among them, for grain requisition alone, the recent grain conference of the Chiang government stipulated that more than 70 to 80 million shi would be collected this year, excluding other various burdens. In Fengrun County, eastern Hebei, which suffered a severe drought, the land tax for last year has not yet been fully paid. The land tax for this year has recently begun to be collected again. The wheat harvested by the farmers is not enough to pay the land tax, and there are about 20 other kinds of exorbitant taxes and levies. The people are so oppressed that they cannot breathe and have to sell their land. In the Chiang-controlled area of ​​Luan County, after the drought, the people have reached a point where they cannot survive without relief, but the exorbitant levies have not been reduced at all. The Chiang government of the county is urging the collection of grain urgently, and those who do not pay the grain will be arrested. Due to the combined attacks of Chiang's disasters and natural disasters, millions of disaster-stricken compatriots are facing starvation and death. They are forced to choose the only way out, which is to rise up and resist Chiang Kai-shek.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 11th - The Shanghai Ta Kung Pao published a dispatch from Guangzhou, reporting the situation of Chiang government officials using the Guangdong flood to get rich, stating: According to the statistics released by the "Flood Emergency Relief Committee", as of August 1st, the committee had received a total of more than 7.6 billion yuan in Chiang currency, more than 28,000 Hong Kong dollars, and 1,060 US dollars in relief donations. Among them, in addition to paying a total of more than 1.95 billion yuan in Chiang currency for emergency relief, the remaining 5.67 billion yuan in Chiang currency, as well as Hong Kong dollars and US dollars, were all deposited in banks to generate interest. Among them, 2 billion yuan (Chiang currency) has openly become the private property of the committee's officials, and the relief rice has been hoarded, earning a profit of 149,043,000 yuan from July 3rd to August 1st. As for the distributed relief rice, according to the "Relief Distribution Team", except for a small part of the third distribution of rice reaching the hands of the victims, most of the rest is sealed in the warehouses of the county governments. Since the summer of this year, Guangdong has suffered severe floods. As of the end of July, according to 73 disaster counties, accounting for seven-tenths of the province's 101 counties and cities, the disaster-stricken cultivated land area is more than 10.2 million mu, the number of displaced disaster victims awaiting relief is approximately 500,000, and the number of deaths is nearly 21,000.

　　法西斯残暴统治带来普遍灾荒
  　蒋区二千万人濒饥饿绝境
  　蒋党官僚利用灾荒贪污发财人民唯一生路只有奋起抗蒋
    【新华社陕北十一日电】综合报导：蒋介石一面挖堤决口，蓄意水淹解放区人民，同时又拼命制造与加深蒋管区人民的灾难。据不完全统计，今夏以来蒋管区发生水旱蝗虫各种灾荒，遍及粤、桂、川、湘、鄂、闽、苏、皖、豫、冀、晋、甘、绥、台湾及东北辽宁等十五省。其中以水灾最为普遍，尤以两广最严重。广东一百零一县市，报灾者达七十县，灾民约五百万，被淹田地八百万市亩，粮食损失共一千八百余万市石。今年秋收，据估计最多也不过二成。至于广西水灾，迄七月十四日止，报灾者已达五十六县，超过全省一百零四县市的一半。农田冲毁三百万亩，灾民一百七十万人。灾情最重之全县，受灾面积几占百分之九十四。广西一省死亡者至少已在二万人以上。其次辽宁蒋管区于七月下旬起，河堤溃决，农田几已全被洪水淹没，其中以沈阳、辽阳、辽中、新民、铁岭、抚顺、本溪、海城、营口等县为最严重。海城全县耕地三百零八万亩中，已被淹二百五十万亩。各县小麦收成全部无望。此外，四川十八县，湖北五十县，湖南十三县，苏北七县，及福建、福州，安徽东南各地，亦均先后发生水灾。
    河南灾荒包括旱蝗冰雹各种，受灾区遍及豫南之内乡、镇平、南阳、唐河，豫西之洛阳、伊川、豫东之扶沟、淮阳、以及郑州、中牟、汜水、郏县各地。只南阳一县田禾损失即达五十六万余亩。河北旱灾三十余县，平津区灾民即有一百九十余万人，此外山西太原附近的旱灾，绥远的水、蝗、冰雹，甘肃兰州等地之雹灾，均极严重。
    根据以上材料估计，全蒋管区受灾耕地面积达数千万市亩，灾民约在二千万以上。
    这些灾荒的蔓延与严重发生，是与蒋介石的残暴腐败统治、发动与扩大内战分不开的。今年绥远水灾，张家口、北平一带报纸均指出这不是什么天灾，而是“人祸”（即蒋祸），因为蒋傅无止境的征兵掠夺，不仅使田园荒芜，更无人修堤筑坝，伐树挖堤，遂酿成水灾。另据中央社透露今年五月间才落成之广东惠阳马鞍山（堤名），由于蒋家水利机关对工程费贪污舞弊偷工减料，刻已被大水冲毁数处，引起各方指责。此外如冀东滦县一带，在今夏旱灾以前，已普遍发生因负担太重而宁愿弃地不耕的现象。在豫北新乡一带，不少农民也弃地逃亡，农村十室九空，灾荒一旦到来，人民只有束手待毙。
    在灾荒发生以后。蒋介石不但不救济灾民，反而继续向受灾人民进攻。联总运华救济物资二百一十余万吨中，百分之九十八点四七给了蒋介石，但是绝大部分救济物资都供应了蒋介石反人民内战，并落入了四大家族及其仆从们的腰包，已成为公开的秘密。早在今年二月，纽约下午报即于其社论中指出：“这一个不偷盗自己人民所得款项就活不下去的政府，乃是一个依靠驱使全国走向自杀制度而生存的寄生虫。联总的物资必须不能够再通过蒋介石政权无法令人置信的贪婪的手而再度被用在别的方面。”
    不仅如此，蒋介石还在一片灾荒声中火上加油违背民意颁布了罪恶的内战“总动员令”。进一步向蒋管区人民逼粮、逼款、逼命。其中单是征粮一项，最近蒋政府的粮食会议即规定今年将征收七、八千余万石以上，其他各种负担尚不在内。惨遭旱灾的冀东丰润县，上年度田赋还未缴齐。本年度田赋最近又已开始征收，农民罄所收小麦全数不够缴纳田赋，另外还有二十种左右的苛杂摊派。人民被压得喘不过气，只得纷纷出卖田地。滦县蒋区于旱灾发生后，人民已到非赈不活的境地，苛征却丝毫未减，该县蒋记县府催粮火急，不缴粮就抓人。由于蒋祸天灾夹攻，千万受灾同胞正面对饥饿死亡。他们被逼着必须选择唯一的生路，就是起来反抗蒋介石。
    【新华社陕北十一日电】上海大公报载广州通讯，报导蒋政府官僚利用广东水灾发财之情形称：根据“水灾紧急救济委员会”发表统计，迄八月一日止，该会共收到救济捐款蒋币七十六亿余元；港币二万八千余元；美金一千零六十元。其中除支付急赈共蒋币十九亿五千余万元外，其余蒋币五十六亿七千余万元，以及港币美金竟全部存于银行生利。其中二十亿元（蒋币）且公然变为该会官僚私产，并将赈米囤积，从七月三日至八月一日，已获利一亿四千九百零四万三千元。至于散放之赈米，据“散赈团”人员自称：除第三次散赈米小部分到达灾民之手外，其余绝大部分均封存各县政府之仓库中。按广东自今夏以来水灾严重，截至七月底止，据灾县份七十三县，占全省一百零一县市的十分之七，受灾耕地一千零二十余万亩，流离待赈灾民约五十万人，死亡者已近二万一千余人。
