On the 5th, our army on the western route recovered Xiangning, and the defending enemy fled in embarrassment to Jixian. On the southern route, our army captured Xiangling on the 9th, and pursued the fleeing enemy to Linfen, recovering the Tumeng stronghold 30 miles northwest of Linfen, and defeating the First Police Corps. On the northern route, it captured Luanhua Village and Dushu stronghold, 30 miles north of Linfen, on the 8th, annihilating more than 100 "Returning Home Regiments". By this time, there were no traces of the enemy in Hongtong and Xiangling, and the liberated area west of Linfen had doubled in size compared to before. Linfen has been surrounded on all sides by the Taiyue and Jin-Southwest troops, becoming increasingly isolated. Furthermore, the people's armed forces active around Linfen have killed or wounded more than 200 enemy soldiers and captured or received the surrender of 280 enemy soldiers since mid-June.
