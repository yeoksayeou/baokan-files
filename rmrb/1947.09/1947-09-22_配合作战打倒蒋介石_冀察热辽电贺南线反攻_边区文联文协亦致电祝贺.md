Liu Deng's and Chen Xie's armies are advancing south, sweeping across vast areas of Hubei, Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu north of the Yangtze River, liberating the broad masses of the people, and shaking the rule of the Chiang bandit. The landscape of the motherland is becoming more radiant. From now on, our army's comprehensive counter-offensive has begun, and the fate of the Chiang bandit's demise is approaching. The military and civilians of Hebei-Chahar-Rehe-Liaoning are determined to make a hundredfold effort, mobilize all human and material resources, strengthen combat, deepen land reform, and increase production on a large scale to cooperate with fraternal liberated areas with even greater victories, overthrow Chiang Kai-shek, and plant the banner of liberation all over China."

[This Newspaper]: The Border Region Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Writers Association sent telegrams to Liu Deng and Chen Xie and forwarded them to all commanders and fighters on the front lines, congratulating them on the great victory of the southern counter-offensive, saying: "With your rapid advance, crossing the Yellow River and cutting off the Longhai Railway, your momentum is like overwhelming mountains and seas, severely damaging the Chiang bandit's heartland. It is expected that the banner of liberation will be planted all over China. We are now deeply engaged in land reform studies, strengthening ideological transformation, and preparing to further develop the border region's mass literary and art movement to better support the front lines and completely eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang!" In addition, the "New Masses" magazine also sent a telegram to the counter-offensive soldiers to pay their respects, expressing their willingness to organize the vast number of readers to support the front lines in various ways with the past enthusiasm for launching book and newspaper consolation activities.
