    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 28th. Reuter's Shanghai dispatch: Thousands of workers at the French-owned tram and bus company, unable to earn enough to eat, demanded an increase of 15 yuan in their base salary and a Mid-Autumn Festival advance of 500,000 yuan. The company refused, and a general strike began on the afternoon of the 27th. According to the Jiang-controlled Shanghai Municipal Government's announcement on the 27th, the worker's cost of living index for September was 34,400 times, and for staff, it was 30,800 times. Compared with the August price index of 55,000 times, this figure is obviously lagging behind the actual cost of living. Reuters claims this incident has caused widespread dissatisfaction among the labor community.

    上海劳工挨饿
    数千工人罢工
    【新华社陕北二十八日电】路透社沪讯：法商电车和公共汽车公司数千工人因吃不饱饭，要求增加底薪十五元及中秋预借工资五十万元，遭公司方面拒绝，于二十七日午后起全体罢工。按二十七日蒋记沪市府宣布九月份工人生活费指数为三万四千四百倍，职员为三万零八百倍。此数与八月份已达五万五千倍之物价指数相较，显然还落实际生活费之后。据路透社称：此事已引起劳工界普遍不满。
