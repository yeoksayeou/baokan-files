　　Yuxiang Macun "Basic People"
  　Establish Turn-Over Mutual Aid Group
    [Report from this newspaper in Taiyue, 4th] The masses of Macun Village, Yuxiang, created the Turn-Over Mutual Aid Group. On the "August 1st" Memorial Day, the District Drama Troupe performed "Zhao Fulai's Combat Mutual Aid Group" in Yuxiang City. Chang Jinfu, the village chief of Macun, felt at the time, "The army can help each other in fighting. Can't our village help each other to turn over?" So he discussed with Wang Xiaohuai, the chairman of the farmers' association, to organize Li Fulin, Shang Linhai, and Chai Kaishun, the activists in the struggle against the tyrannical landlord Chang Yuanheng, and Wang Zhiping and Wang Qishu, the poorest of the poor peasants and hired laborers, as "basic people," and to organize the Turn-Over Mutual Aid Group with them as the backbone. And at the meeting, he proposed: To turn over, we must help each other, and not let the poor people be bullied. After these thirty-two "basic people" mobilized and organized day and night, everyone scrambled to participate in the evening party on August 20th. They said: "Now I know! We poor people should unite, seek redress for grievances, and avenge our hatred. How the landlords treated us in the past, we will treat them the same way today." Zhu Jieping said: "When helping each other, we must draw blood when killing, and save people completely. We must do it!" Within two days, the mutual aid mobilization had developed to sixty-nine people, becoming a solid foundation for the farmers' association.

　　虞乡麻村“基本人”
  　成立翻身互助组
    【本报太岳四日电】虞乡麻村群众，创造翻身互助组。“八一”纪念日，分区剧团在虞乡城内出演“赵福来战斗互助组”，麻村村长常进福，当时便感到“军队打仗能互助，咱村翻身就不能互助？”于是他就和农会主席王小怀商量，将斗争奸霸常元亨时的积极分子李福林、尚林孩、柴开顺与贫雇农中苦最大的王治平、王齐舒等“基本人”组织起来，以他们为骨干，再组织翻身互助组。并在会议上提出：翻身要互助，不让苦人受气。经过这三十二个“基本人”的白天黑夜动员组织后，八月二十日的晚会上，大家争着参加，他们说：“现在我知道了！咱们受苦人该团结起来，有冤诉冤，有仇报仇。过去地主怎样待咱，咱今天就怎样对他。”朱介平说：“互助起来，杀人要见血，救人要救活，非干不行！”两天内互助动员已发展至六十九名，成为农会的坚固基础。
