　　The Taiyue Troops’ Thought Examination Has Achieved Results
　　Like Sharpening a Knife, Revealing its Sharpness
　　[This article was] Transmitted by our Taiyue [correspondent] on the 30th. The movement of examining class [standpoint] and examining thoughts, which is regarded as a “sharpening the knife” campaign, has achieved preliminary results in various units. It was discovered that Jiao Wubao's battalion, when stationed in Jishan in the past, intentionally or unintentionally hindered the land reform. Cheng Lidong comforted a landlord after he was struggled against, and said, "Isn't the struggle just that?" The Seventh Company even secretly provided quilts and white flour to the landlord. The Ninth Company, in Tianzhang, Yangcheng, similarly secretly provided ten chicken eggs to the landlord, provoking the masses to dare to be angry but not to speak out. After review, it was unanimously recognized that this was related to landlord ideology, supporting the landlord, and attacking the masses' struggle for emancipation. Secondly, many people from landlord families have liquidated and corrected their exploitative thoughts. Wang Fengqi, from the Eighteenth Sub-district Training Corps, was from a landlord background. When discussing landlord exploitation, he believed that his family was a "good landlord" and got a wife for a hired laborer. Even Zhang Shurong, who was from a middle peasant background, said, "There are also good landlords. Like Wang Fengqi's family, they even got a wife for a hired laborer." This sparked fierce debate and stalemate. The tenant farmer Liu Zhonglian immediately exposed this secret: "Getting a wife for a hired laborer just increases a laborer, and isn't it just allowing the landlord to increase a share of exploitation?" This made Wang Fengqi and others suddenly realize that the landlord was indeed trying to exploit the masses everywhere. In addition, a movement of speaking out bitterness and examining roots was launched. Jin Chengyuan of the 5th Company of the 407 Unit was from Yanghe, Qinyang. He was liberated during the Xiangling battle. When he spoke of his family selling what they could and dying, he cried for three whole days, shouting, "I want revenge! I want revenge!" In the training corps alone, more than 90 people participated in speaking out bitterness, including 15 who were forced to lose their families by the landlords and 11 who were forced to die. During the movement, because they were able to distinguish that the landlords were our enemies, three hidden spies, including Zhang Sizhong, who had infiltrated the troops were discovered and investigated. They had attempted to organize an escape and assassinate cadres. Each unit is like sharpening a knife, and after sharpening, it reveals a shining light.

　　太岳部队查思想已获成效
  　好象磨刀露光芒
    【本报太岳卅日电】被认为磨刀子运动的查阶级查思想运动开展以来，已在各部队中获得初步效果。焦五保所在营检查出过去在稷山驻扎时，有意无意的阻碍了土地改革的进行。程立东一个地主被斗争后，给予安慰，并说：“斗争还不是那一回事？”七连并给地主埋伏被子、白面。九连在阳城天掌，同样给地主埋伏十只鸡子，惹得群众敢怒而不敢言。检讨后一致公认这是与地主思想有联系，为地主撑腰，打击群众翻身斗争。其次，不少来自地主家庭的人，清算与纠正了自己的剥削思想，十八分区教导队王凤歧是地主出身，当讨论地主剥削时，他认为自己家庭是个“好地主”，给雇工娶了个老婆，连中农出身的张树荣也说：“地主也有好的，象王凤岐家还给雇工娶老婆。”由此引起了激烈的争论，相持不下，佃贫农刘中廉一下子就揭穿了这个秘密：“给雇工娶老婆就增加了一个劳动力，还不是可以让地主增加了一份剥削。”这才使王凤岐等恍然大悟，地主确是处处想法剥削群众的。另外纷纷展开了诉苦查根运动。四○七部队五连靳成原是沁阳杨河人，在襄陵战争中解放的，诉到自己一家人卖的卖死的死，整整哭了三天，喊着：“要报仇、要报仇！”仅教导队就有九十多人参加诉苦，其中被地主迫得倾家荡产的十五人，被迫死人的十一人。在运动中，因为能分清了地主与我们是仇人冤家，发现与清查出混入部队的张寺中等三个暗藏特务，他们曾企图组织逃跑，杀害干部。各部队正如磨刀子一样，磨了一下，露出了闪闪的光芒。
