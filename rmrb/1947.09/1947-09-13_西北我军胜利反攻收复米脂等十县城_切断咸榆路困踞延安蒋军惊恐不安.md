Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 11th: Just as the Chiang Kai-shek's Shaanxi Provincial Government announced its "administrative integrity of northern Shaanxi," the Northwest People's Liberation Army had already launched a counter-offensive. One day before the victorious annihilation of Hu Zongnan's 36th Division at Shajiadian, Mizhi, on August 19th, a unit of the People's Liberation Army and local armed forces liberated Fugu County, northeast of Yulin, in one fell swoop. On the 6th of this month, Mizhi County was also recovered. Hu's troops, who had occupied Jia County, abandoned the city and fled on the 9th. The People's Liberation Army is pursuing them fiercely. To date, the number of county towns recovered and liberated by the People's Liberation Army has reached ten, namely Jingbian, Wuqi, Gu Lin (the above two counties are newly established), Anding, Anse, Zhidan (formerly Bao'an), Wubao, Mizhi, Jia County, and Fugu.

Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 11th: Due to the defeat in the northern front and the emptiness of troops in the southern front, the Chiang's 27th Division and 47th Brigade garrisoning the isolated city of Yan'an are extremely panicked. They are repairing fortifications, erecting barbed wire, and burying landmines all day long. All shops and markets in the city have been driven to Qilipu outside the South Gate. Pedestrians are prohibited from entering the suburbs, and every "bao" is forced to contribute 100 shi of wheat and 36 able-bodied men. The masses refused to respond to the conscription and flocked to the People's Guerrilla, participating in combat and road destruction. The Xianyang-Yulin Highway has now been cut off, and Chiang's army is extremely panicked about food supplies. Officers deceive soldiers by saying, "The highway has been washed away by water," but the soldiers know that "the People's Liberation Army has cut it off," and they are trying to escape. In Zhujiagou, east of Yan'an, within Chiang Kai-shek's Bao'an Regiment's 3rd Battalion, 6th Company, in just one day, thirteen men, led by their squad leader, deserted with all their weapons.

　　西北我军胜利反攻收复米脂等十县城
  　切断咸榆路困踞延安蒋军惊恐不安
    【新华社西北十一日电】当蒋记陕西省政府宣布其“陕北行政完整”的时候，西北人民解放军已经转入反攻。在米脂沙家店胜利歼灭胡军三十六师之前一天，即八月十九日，解放军某部及地方武装一举解放榆林东北之府谷县城，本月六日又收复米脂县城。侵占葭县城之胡军又于九日弃城逃窜。解放军正猛烈追击中。至此，解放军收复及解放之县城已达十座，即靖边、吴旗、固临（以上二县为新设县）、安定、安塞、志丹（即保安）、吴堡、米脂、葭县及府谷。
    【新华社西北十一日电】由于北线失利，南线兵力空虚，踞守延安孤城的蒋军二十七师四十七旅极形恐慌，终日赶修工事，架设铁丝网，埋藏地雷，将市内商店集市一律赶至南关外之七里铺，禁止行人进入市郊，并每保强征麦子一百石，壮丁三十六名。群众拒绝应征，相率投奔人民游击队，参加作战与破路。现咸（阳）榆（林）公路已告中断，蒋军食粮极为恐慌，军官欺骗士兵说：“公路被水冲坏了”，但士兵知道“是解放军切断了”，纷纷设法逃跑，仅延安东朱家沟蒋记保安团三营六连，一日之间即有十三人在班长带领下全部携械逃跑。
