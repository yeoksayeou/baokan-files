　　[Report from our newspaper in the border region of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan on the 13th] In Liuzhuang Village, Feicheng County, in the guerrilla zone, the poor peasants rectified the undemocratic village cadres and the practice of monopolizing and embezzling the fruits of the masses' struggle, establishing a core of poor peasant leadership, and the entire village took on a new look. The village has more than 320 households, of which over 170 are poor peasant households and only 20 are landlord and rich peasant households. Most of the poor peasants rely on weaving to make a living. During the land reform this spring, each poor peasant was only allocated an average of 1.5 mu of land, while the landlord Chen Changbing and others still had an average of 4 mu of irrigated garden land per person. The poor peasants said: "After struggling for most of the spring, the land we got is not even worth the effort of weaving a few more bolts of cloth!" After the review began, the leadership proposed "thoroughly eliminating the landlords," but because the poor peasants were not in charge, although three landlord families were purged, it was still superficial. The poor peasants were dissatisfied with the middle peasants, saying: "In the district meetings, the superiors said that the poor peasants should get more and the middle peasants should get less. Why are we now getting the same amount as the middle peasants? The middle peasants wore new blue serge clothes for the New Year, but what did we wear?" The sisters of the women's association also questioned the village cadres: "When you were clearing out the landlords, you ran under the big locust tree to drink tea. When we cleared things out, you sent them back to the landlords at night. Do you still want to get more now!" In anger, the poor peasants tore up several pieces of clothing that had been distributed on the spot. At the same time, they also raised the opinion to the district that the village cadres were undemocratic, monopolized and got more of the fruits, and protected the landlords. The district leadership also made a self-criticism of the village work, affirmed that it was necessary to establish a backbone of poor peasants, and, based on the opinions of the poor peasants, brought the village chief to the district for reflection. On one hand, it convened poor peasant meetings and mass meetings to openly discuss the methods of distributing the fruits and filling the poverty gap. The poor peasants immediately broke up the old groups and separated from the middle peasants. At this time, some middle peasants were panic-stricken, and the poor peasants made it clear that the poor and middle peasants were one family and guaranteed not to struggle against the middle peasants. After the middle peasants understood the situation, they also expressed their determination to unite with the poor peasants to eliminate the landlords. They engaged in speaking bitterness which made the poor and middle peasants even more united. Then, with the poor peasants as the main force, they purged several more landlord families. When distributing the fruits, most of the grain, farm tools, plowing cattle, and valuable things were distributed to the poor peasants. General odds and ends, such as teapots, wine cups, strip weaving machines, and other furniture, were distributed to the middle peasants. The method of leveling and making up the difference was conscientiously implemented. The middle peasants felt that the things distributed to the poor peasants were not as many as their own belongings, and some voluntarily gave what they had been allocated to the poor peasants. The poor and middle peasants are united, and a deep investigation and review is now underway.

　　刘庄改造中农领导贫雇当家深入复查
    【本报冀鲁豫十三日电】肥城县游击区刘庄贫农，纠正村干不民主，及包办与贪污群众斗争果实，树立贫农领导核心，全村气象一新。该村共有三百二十余户，贫农就有一百七十户，地主富农仅有二十户，贫农大部分靠织布来维持生活，今春土改时，贫农每人只填平到一亩半，而地主陈昌炳等，每人平均还有四亩地的水浇园，贫农说：“斗争了多半春，分的地还不如多织几机布哩！”复查开始后，领导上提出“彻底消灭地主”，但因为贫农不当家，虽清算了三家地主，仍是表面的，贫农对中农不满，说：“在区里开会，上级说的贫农多分，中农少分，为什么现在给俺和中农一样分呢？中农年下穿的蓝士林新衣裳，俺穿的什么呀？”姊妹团员也质问村干说：“你们在清理地主时，跑到大槐树底下喝茶，俺清理出东西来，你夜间给地主送去，现在还想多分东西！”气愤之下，贫农当场把分的衣裳撕碎了好几件，同时并向区里提出村干部不民主，包办和多分果实，袒护地主的意见。区领导上对村工作也作了检讨，肯定必须树立贫农骨干，根据贫农意见将村长开到区里反省，一面召开贫农会、群众会，公开讲分果实及填穷坑的办法，贫农当场把过去的小组打乱，与中农分开。这时中农有些恐慌，贫农便表明，贫中农一家，保证不斗中农，中农摸到了底，也表示决心和贫农联合起来，消灭地主，进行了诉苦，贫中农更加团结了，接着以贫农为主，又清算了几家地主。分果实时大部粮食农具耕牛及值钱的东西，都分给贫农。一般零星东西，如茶壶、酒盏、条机等家具，分给中农。认真实行了填平补齐办法，中农认为贫农所分的东西，还不如自己的家当多，有的自动把所分的东西，让给贫农。中贫农团结，现正深入复查。
