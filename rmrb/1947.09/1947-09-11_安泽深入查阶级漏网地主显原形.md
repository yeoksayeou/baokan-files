(Taiyue, September 8th) In Anze, all the landlords who slipped through the net and feudal remnants are gradually revealing themselves. After a general investigation of stance and in-depth mobilization across the county, re-investigations have been launched in various villages. In Guozhuang, Tenth District, the poor and hired peasants are the backbone, carrying out demarcation, evaluating class status, and uncovering six households of landlords and feudal remnants who had slipped through the net. The reasons why these feudal forces have been able to hide until now are threefold: (1) They pretend to be activists, approaching leaders diligently and threatening the masses by taking advantage of their power. Li Sen was originally a village head. Because he gained the trust of the leaders, he boasted to the masses, "Now I am a top county and district cadre. You can give me opinions, but think about the future." Therefore, the masses were scared and dared not breathe a word. (2) They disperse their property to pretend to be poor. Guo Siniu was also a village head, owning an estate of more than 300 mu of land and lending at usurious rates. In 1937, seeing that the trend of rent and interest reduction was not good, he sold the estate and bought a few mu of land in another village, so he was overlooked in the mass movement. (3) They use petty favors to fool the masses and escape struggle. Wang An, a usurer, fearing that the masses would settle accounts with him, treated them to meals, etc., paralyzing some of the masses and treating him as "one of their own." After this ideological examination by the entire village, under the slogan of "Don't be afraid of the landlord's clever methods, just be careful and find them slowly," he has been uprooted. In Hechuan Township, First District, the masses compare their lives with the landlords to raise awareness, first carrying out self-reporting to clarify their status. For example, Li, an old lady, reported six dou of corn and dozens of brooms that she had stored for the landlord. Liang Baorong also reported 24,000 yuan and two large @ that he had stored for the landlord. In this re-investigation, the masses further recognized that the landlord and feudal forces are always the enemies of the peasants. Yang Fatang, a local tyrant in a village in the First District, was left with 26 mu of land, one cave dwelling, and many household items after the masses settled accounts with him. Not only did he not bow his head to the masses, but on the second day of the struggle, he destroyed the fruits of the masses' struggle, beat the activist Yue Jicheng, and declared, "Whoever settles accounts with me, I will kill them." After ineffectual leniency, the masses continued to struggle and completely defeated him.

(Jinan, September 8th) Wucheng landlords desperately change their forms to escape. It has recently been discovered that many landlords have dispersed their land and concealed their class status in various ways. Xu Yu often, a landlord in Cangshang Village, First District, gave four mu of land to Xu Lan, a family member of a soldier, and dispersed more than 20 mu to other family members of soldiers. Feng Shu, a traitorous district chief in Zhao Miao Village, Second District, in order to obtain the "legal right" to disperse land, with the approval of the village government, gave it to poor relatives of his family. Hei Zhouzi, a landlord in Zhao Xing Village, Fifth District, ran away, pretending to sell the land to a Tianjin businessman. After escaping, knowing that the land would have to be returned to the peasants, he stated that "when the Central Army arrives in Wucheng, I will come to cultivate the land." A landlord in Beima Village came up with a deceptive method long ago, dividing his family into fragments, and he and his wife also separated. In the past, the rules for dividing the family were to divide into several shares according to the number of brothers, but his family changed to a new example, dividing into many shares according to the population, reducing the target and concealing the original form. In addition, some family members of soldiers who were landlords, seeing that the poor peasants had received the fruits of land reform, sold a large amount of their land, speculating to pretend to be poor, and seizing the land that the poor peasants deserved.

　　安泽深入查阶级漏网地主显原形
    【本报太岳八日电】安泽所有漏网地主与封建尾巴逐渐现形。全县经过普遍的查立场与深入发动后，各村复查先后展开。十区郭庄以雇贫为骨干，进行划界线，评成份，查出漏网地主与封建尾巴六户。这些封建势力所以能隐藏至今，其原因有三：（一）假装积极分子，对领导上殷勤接近，对群众则仗势威胁。李森本是庄头，因取得领导上的信任，便向群众吹牛说：“现在我是顶县区干部，你们给我提意见是可以的，不过想想将来。”因此群众被吓得再也不敢透气了。（二）将财产分散装穷。郭四牛也是个庄头，原有三百多亩土地的一个庄子，并放过高利贷。三十七年，他看到减租减息势头不对，便将庄子卖了，另在别庄上买了几亩地，因此在大运动中便被遗漏了。（三）以小恩小惠愚弄群众，逃脱了斗争。高利贷者王安，怕群众向其清算，请吃饭等等，麻痹了部分群众，将其当成“自己人”。此次全村群众经过思想检查后，在“不怕地主办法巧，只要细心慢慢找”的口号下，已连根刨出。一区和川镇群众与地主比生活，提高觉悟，首先进行自报清身子，如李老太太为地主保存的六斗玉茭，扫帚几十个，全部报出。梁保荣也报出为地主保存的两万四千元，大＠两个。在此次复查中，又使群众认识了地主封建势力永远是农民的敌人。一区某村恶霸杨发堂，群众向其清算后，仍给其留下二十六亩地，窑一孔，及许多日用家俱，他不仅不向群众低头，反在斗争的第二日将群众斗争果实捣毁，殴打积极分子岳计成，并扬言：“谁和我算帐，就打死谁。”群众在宽宏无效之后，继续斗争，将其彻底打垮。
    【本报冀南八日电】武城地主拚命化形逃脱。最近发现不少地主疏散了土地，隐蔽成份，其办法多种多样。一区仓上村地主徐玉常，送给抗属徐兰地四亩，另疏散给其他抗属二十多亩。二区赵庙村汉奸区长冯书，为取得疏散土地的“合法权”，经村公所批准，送给本家穷人。五区赵行村地主黑轴子逃跑，假装把地卖给天津商人，逃身后，自知土地得归还农民，言明“中央军啥时到武城就来种地”。北马村某地主很早就想出了骗人法，将家分得七零八散，他和他老婆也分开了。过去分家规矩是按兄弟多少分成几股，而他家改作新例子，按人口分成很多股，缩小目标，隐蔽原形。另外有的抗属地主看到贫农分到果实，把自己大量土地卖掉，投机装贫，夺取贫农应得的土地。
