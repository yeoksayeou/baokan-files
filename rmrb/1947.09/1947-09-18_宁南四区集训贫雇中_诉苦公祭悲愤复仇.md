(From our newspaper in Southern Hebei, 16th) Over a thousand poor peasants, hired peasants, party members, and activists from the Fourth District of Ningnan gathered in late August to conduct class and ideological self-examination. Twenty people were found to be soft-hearted, fifty-six dared not strike hard during the struggle, forty pitied the landlords, and five hundred and sixty feared revenge. Over six hundred people were found to be wholeheartedly serving the masses. On the third day, they began to pour out their grievances, with cadres also participating, wailing and weeping, and the entire assembly shedding tears. Thirty-nine victims from seventeen villages in the district recounted a total of 289 lives taken by landlords through persecution, murder, and collusion with enemy puppets. On the 30th, a public memorial meeting was held to recount grievances. Each victim wore mourning clothes, carried the memorial tablets of the deceased, and all members gathered in the east of the village. A second round of grievance recounting unfolded. Yang ＠lu, sixteen years old from Putou, bitterly recounted before the spirits that his uncle was poisoned by a landlord and his father was shot and killed by a landlord north of the village. He said, "At that time, I didn't even dare to cry, but now I have the freedom to cry!" and burst into uncontrollable tears. Cao Houfuqing's mother from Nan Ding said, "My son led the liberation and was poisoned to death by the landlord. The landlord killed seven of them in a row, saying that they weren't even allowed to be wrapped in a mat, and I didn't dare to cry. At that time, I was dumbfounded. When I picked up the corpse, I still wanted to take one last look, and fresh blood splattered all over me. I still have the blood-soaked clothes. Whenever I think of my son, I look at them." Then she cried out for her son and wailed loudly. On the spot, they demanded that landlord and special agent Tian Laoliu and Wen Xinfa be sacrificed alive, and they were executed by firing squad before the spirits, greatly satisfying the crowd's desire for revenge and boosting morale, shouting slogans to settle accounts with the landlords.

(From our newspaper in Southern Hebei, 15th) Members of the hired peasants' representative meeting in the Fourth District of Ningnan greatly improved their class consciousness through ideological self-examination and recounting grievances during the training. On September 1st, over a thousand male and female representatives and members eagerly offered up the wealth of the landlords. Hua Hengxiang, an old farmer from Putou, said, "I am determined to separate from the households being struggled against. My family has landlord Zhang Qingyi's ＠wheat, and I will donate it to our farmers' association." Following this, seven or eight women and 292 farmer members donated landlord property, including a large amount of grain, flour, medicine, Jichaos, bundles, clothing, cloth, furniture, etc. Everyone said: The landlord's wealth that is visible is not as much as the wealth hidden away, and we are determined to thoroughly pursue the "air-raid shelters" when we return.
