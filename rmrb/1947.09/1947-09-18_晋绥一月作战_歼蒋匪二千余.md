　　Jin-Sui One-Month Campaign
  　Over 2,000 Chiang Kai-shek Bandits Annihilated
    [Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, 16th] The Jin-Sui Military Region Headquarters recently released its August combat bulletin (battle achievements of our troops operating in neighboring areas are not included): The main battles of a portion of our region's main forces and local armed guerrillas in August were the offensive in the Shenmu area of ​​Hexi on August 25, in coordination with the Northwest Liberation Army's Yulin-Mizhi campaign, and repelling the Yan Xishan army's grain-grabbing offensive in the Jinzhong Plain. A total of 115 battles were fought, killing or wounding more than 820 enemies, capturing Zhang Ziying, deputy commander of the Shaanxi-North Gansu military region with the rank of Major General, and 1,553 others including Li Hanfang, commander of the 86th Regiment. Sixty-one light and heavy machine guns, six mortars, nineteen small cannons, seventeen grenade launchers, one thousand three hundred and forty-three long and short guns, and ninety-six thousand rounds of ammunition were seized. Pu County in southwestern Shanxi was liberated, and Fugu in northern Shaanxi and Xiangning in southwestern Shanxi were once captured.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 16th] Medical workers in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, under the slogan of "Healing one wounded soldier is equal to killing ten enemies," the First Rear Hospital spontaneously formed a blood transfusion team of more than 60 people, which has transfused 5,170 cc of blood, thereby saving many critically ill wounded soldiers. Dr. Wu Aiji transfused 500 cc of blood to wounded soldiers. Overcoming the difficulties of medicine and equipment, many new innovations have emerged. For example, in addition to applying medicine to treat trauma to the head and facial organs, other parts of severe injuries are no longer treated with medicine, but mainly treated with incision and debridement followed by plaster bandaging. The cure or effectiveness rate of this method reaches 97.7% of the total number of treatments. The Third Rear Hospital connected a kettle rubber tube and a hollow copper rod to replace the steam machine. The efficiency of treatment work has generally improved by leaps and bounds. In the Second Branch of the First Rear Hospital, a large and complex operating room can be set up within three hours. A high-pressure steam sterilization boiler weighing more than 200 kilograms can be installed and used in only two hours. Pharmacist Yan Chong alone undertook the work of 30 people in the pharmacy in the past; the laboratory used to have six people working, testing more than 30 blood and germ samples every day, but now Li Laicheng alone can test 22 samples in one day.
