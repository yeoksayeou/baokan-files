　　Wu Xiang County Party Committee Calls on Cadres
　　Investigate Typical Villages in Preparation for Major Re-examination
　　[Reported from Wu Xiang] The Wu Xiang County Party Committee calls on cadres to study the land reform summary and conduct typical investigations in preparation for a major re-examination. The county is divided into three types of villages: The first type are advanced villages where land reform is relatively thorough and feudalism has been thoroughly eliminated, such as Shuxin Village in the Third District. The second type are general villages where feudalism has not been completely eliminated, such as Shibizi Village in the Fifth District. The third type are villages where land reform is far behind and feudalism has not yet been eliminated, such as Xibao Village in the Second District. Currently, typical investigations and research are being conducted based on these three types to determine a direction. It is also proposed to plant early and quickly, to free up labor early to complete the autumn harvest, and to prepare to begin the re-examination, so as to thoroughly and ultimately eliminate feudalism and allow peasants to completely stand up.

　　武乡县委号召干部
  　调查典型村准备大复查
    【本报武乡讯】武乡县委号召干部学习土地改革总结，并作典型调查准备大复查。全县分三类村：第一种先进村，土地改革较彻底，封建消灭彻底，如三区树辛村。第二种一般村封建消灭不彻底，如五区石鼻村。第三种村土地改革差的远，封建尚未消灭，如二区西堡村。现根据三种类型，作典型调查研究，确定方针，并提出早种赶种，赶出工来早完成秋收，准备开始复查，做到彻底最终消灭封建，农民彻底翻身。（步鳌）
