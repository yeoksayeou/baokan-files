    History tells us that since 1927, Chiang Kai-shek betrayed Sun Yat-sen's Three Great Policies, destroyed the united front between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, and colluded with imperialism to start an anti-people, counter-revolutionary civil war. Five years later, the Japanese imperialists took the opportunity to launch the September 18th Incident. At that time, General Zhang Xueliang asked Nanjing for instructions from Beiping. Chiang Kai-shek, based on his policy of surrender and civil war, instructed "no conflict" and "absolutely adhere to the policy of non-resistance." It was precisely Chiang Kai-shek who was responsible for this; from this, it can be known that the September 18th Incident was the result of Chiang Kai-shek's pursuit of dictatorship and civil war. Chiang Kai-shek should bear full responsibility for the fourteen years of enslavement, exploitation, massacre, and rape suffered by the people of the Northeast at the hands of the Japanese invaders.

    Not long after the enemy invaded the entire three northeastern provinces and Jehol, Chiang Kai-shek issued his well-known "great theory": "Our 'revolutionary' enemy is not Japan, but 'bandits' (referring to the Communist Party, whom he falsely accused as the people and revolution). It doesn't matter if the three northeastern provinces and Jehol are lost... From the 'revolutionary' standpoint, it doesn't matter. This time, the Japanese occupied the three northeastern provinces and Jehol, and the 'revolutionary party' is not responsible. Losing them does not cause any loss to the 'revolution'..." Obviously, Chiang Kai-shek and his "revolutionary party" had already made a decision: to disregard the survival of the four northeastern provinces and the fate of the 40 million people in the Northeast for the sake of dictatorial civil war, that is, to decide to betray the Northeast. Therefore, they not only did not resist the Japanese invaders in the slightest, but instead retreated step by step and constantly sought peace, thus successively signing the "Shanghai Truce," the "Tanggu Truce," the "He-Umezu Agreement," and even the "China-Japan-Manchukuo Through Train and Postal Agreement," which was tantamount to openly acknowledging "Manchukuo," completely abandoning the Northeast, and plunging our Northeast compatriots into the abyss of suffering without any concern.

    The ironclad evidence of Chiang Kai-shek's betrayal of the Northeast is not limited to this!

    In 1939, when the Chiang Kai-shek government, which was forced to resist Japan, retreated to Wuhan, Wang Jingwei chanted "Peace to Save the Nation," Kong Xiangxi talked about the "failure of the War of Resistance," and pro-Japanese elements such as the "weaponry-only" He Yingqin, the CC clique leader Chen Lifu, and the politicians Zhang Qun and Wu Dingchang, all ran around to seek peace.

    In 1939, Xiao Zhenying was sent to Hong Kong to negotiate peace with the Japanese invaders. The conditions for peace proposed by Chiang Kai-shek at that time were: "As long as Japan withdraws from Central China, South China, and North China and restores the situation before the July 7th Incident," needless to say: the Northeast was not wanted. Xiao himself frankly and openly talked to me about Chiang Kai-shek's betrayal of the Northeast. Chiang Kai-shek himself would not forget, would he? During the War of Resistance, the people of the whole country, the Communists, and our Northeast compatriots exiled in Guannei all ran around shouting: "Persist in the War of Resistance to the end" and "Fight to the Yalu River" to recover the lost territory in the Northeast, while Chiang Kai-shek explained at the Fifth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang: "Persisting in the War of Resistance to the end is to restore the situation before the 'July 7th' Incident" is based on "a statement based on China as the standard," that is, the Northeast is not within the territory of China, and there is no need to recover the Northeast at all. Conversely, his proposition is: betray the Northeast to satisfy the enemy and continue the civil war to complete his fascist rule.

    Based on the above facts alone, Chiang Kai-shek's decision and crime of betraying the Northeast, and Chiang Kai-shek's heinous crimes against the people of the Northeast, have been revealed as clearly as a case file like a mountain.

    Since Chiang Kai-shek was determined to betray the Northeast before the restoration, he then heartlessly "accepted" the Northeast after the restoration. For the past two years, he has violated the wishes of the people of the Northeast, disregarded the demands of the people of the whole country, carried out civil war in the Northeast, slaughtered our Northeast compatriots, and insisted on establishing a "second Manchukuo" rule of corruption, bribery, rape, plunder, and enslavement of the people of the Northeast, causing the elders and fellow countrymen in the Northeast, who had groaned under the enemy's iron hooves for fourteen years, to face Jiang's brutal oppression again. What did the Northeast compatriots owe to Chiang Kai-shek?! Why is Chiang Kai-shek's hatred of the Northeast compatriots so extreme?!

    Chiang Kai-shek's harm to the Northeast is so great, yet he thinks it is not enough. Recently, he has intensified his efforts, colluding with American imperialism and supporting the resurgence of Japanese fascist forces, so that the iron hooves of Japanese fascism will once again trample on the Northeast mainland. Chiang Kai-shek is creating a second "September 18th Incident" to plunge our Northeast compatriots into an abyss of misery.

    Our Northeast compatriots, quickly rise up and fight together! Thoroughly overthrow Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous and brutal rule!

    蒋介石如何出卖东北
    阎宝航
    按：作者阎宝航氏为前东北救亡总会领导人之一，现任东北民主政府辽宁省主席。本文系于“九一八”十六周年特为新华社而作。     
   ——编者
    历史告诉了我们，蒋介石自从民国十六年起，背叛孙中山先生的三大政策，破坏了国共的联合阵线，勾结帝国主义开始了反人民反革命的内战，五年之后，日本帝国主义者就乘机而入，发动了九一八事变。当时张学良将军由北平向南京请示办法，蒋介石本其投降内战政策，指示“不许冲突”，“绝对抱不抵抗主义”者，正是蒋介石；由此可知，九一八是蒋介石为独裁而进行内战所招致造成的后果，东北同胞遭受日寇十四年的奴役剥削，屠杀奸污，蒋介石应负全部责任。
    在敌人侵略了整个东三省及热河以后不久，蒋介石曾发出了人所共闻的“伟论”：“我们‘革命’的敌人不是日本，而是‘土匪’（按即诬指为人民为革命的共产党），东三省与热河失掉了，…………我们站在‘革命’立场说，没有什么关系。这回日本占领东三省、热河，‘革命党’是不能负责的，失掉了是于‘革命’无所损失的………。”显然蒋介石和他的“革命党”早有决策：为了独裁内战而把东北四省之存亡，东北四千万同胞之命运，置之度外，就是说：决心出卖东北。所以对日寇不但不稍加抵抗，反而步步退让，时时求和，因而接连签订了“淞沪协定”、“塘沽协定”、“何梅协定”以至“中日满通车通邮协定”竟等于公然承认了“伪满洲国”，彻底断送了东北，陷我东北同胞于苦海深渊而毫不顾惜。
    蒋介石出卖东北的铁证又岂止于此！
    民国二十八年当被迫抗战的蒋介石政府退到武汉的时候，汪逆精卫高唱：“和平救国”，孔祥熙大谈“抗战失利”等谬论，“唯武器论”的亲日分子何应钦之流，西西头子陈立夫以及政学系的张群、吴鼎昌之辈，莫不为其奔走求和。
    民国二十八年萧振瀛被派潜赴香港对日寇媾和，蒋介石当时所提的媾条件是：“只要日本退出华中、华南、华北恢复七七以前状况”，不言而喻：东北不要了。萧某曾亲对笔者毫无隐讳侃侃而谈蒋介石出卖东北的事实，蒋贼自己也不会善忘吧？抗战期间，全国人民共产党人以及我东北流亡关内同胞，莫不奔走呼号：“坚持抗战到底”，“打到鸭绿江边”以收复东北失地，而蒋介石则在国民党五中全会上解释：“抗战到底是要恢复‘七七’事变以前状况”是根据“以中国为基准的说法，”就是说：东北不在中国版图之内，根本就不要收复东北，反过来说，他的主张就是：出卖东北，以满足敌人，而仍然进行内战，完成其法西斯的统治。
    仅据上述事实，蒋介石出卖东北的决策与罪行，蒋介石对东北同胞的滔天罪行已经昭然若揭发案如山。
    蒋介石既然决心出卖东北于光复之前，竟又狠心“接受”东北于光复之后，两年以来违反东北人民的意愿，不顾全国人民的要求，在东北进行内战，屠杀我东北同胞，并执意在东北建立贪污腐败奸淫掳掠奴役东北人民的“二满洲”统治，致使在敌人铁蹄下呻吟十四年的东北父老同胞，又面临将贼的残暴压榨，东北同胞何亏于蒋介石？！蒋介石又何以对东北同胞的仇视至于此极？！
    蒋介石之祸东北如此，犹以为未足，近更变本加厉，勾结美帝国主义，扶植日本法西斯势力再起，使日本法西斯的铁蹄将重踏东北大陆，蒋介石正在制造第二变“九一八”以陷我东北同胞于万劫不复之地。
    我东北同胞赶快起来一致奋斗吧！彻底打倒蒋介石卖国残民的暴行统治！
