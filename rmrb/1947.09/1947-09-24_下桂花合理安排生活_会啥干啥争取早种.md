    Xiaguihua Rationally Arranges Life
    Does What They Know, Strives for Early Sowing
    [Our Newspaper, Licheng News] In Yiqu, Xiaguihua Village's wheat sowing work, under the leadership of Labor Hero Gao Yu Kuan, each team has made thorough plans and rationally arranged their lives, doing what they say they will do. For example, Wang Leping is good at planting, so he is assigned to specialize in planting wheat. Wang Song is a good plowman, so he is assigned to specialize in plowing. They also organized manpower to carry manure early and late. Gao Tu's team used eight laborers to carry 650 loads of manure, saving 32 livestock workdays. Gao Jinde's team carried manure, saving livestock for plowing. The village has a total of 3377 mu of land, with 1149 mu of existing wheat land. 758 mu have already been sown (including 169 mu of wheat and 475 mu of other crops), with 391 mu not yet sown. This year, the whole village expanded its wheat fields by 443 mu, bringing the total to 1592 mu, accounting for 47% of the total land. The slogan is to finish sowing all the wheat by the Autumn Equinox, cutting and planting one piece at a time.
    During wheat planting, each team also formulated autumn harvest and autumn plowing plans. For example, Gao Sanqin's team plans to use the time after sowing but before the crops are ripe to grind flour for a few days and transport coal a few times, to avoid shortages of food, drink, and fuel during the autumn harvest. In terms of autumn harvest preparation, the slogan is to cut one piece as it turns yellow and plow one piece as it's cut, striving to complete the autumn harvest before the fifth day of the ninth lunar month, and to have all the autumn land plowed before the Frost's Descent. (Bu Heng, San Xing)
    [Our Newspaper, Xiyang News] After the county party committee issued the call to vigorously plant wheat to remedy the famine, various places, under the leadership of cadres, heroes, and party members, resolved the masses' ideological concerns about not being accustomed to planting wheat, fearing hardship, and thinking it wouldn't help. They successively formulated plans. For example, in Dongfengren of the third district, under the leadership of the new hero Tian Shiren, the slogan "Plow the wheat three times to equal applying manure" was put forward, and the masses were organized to open up 96 mu of wasteland and plant 142 mu of catch-crop wheat, reaching one mu of wheat per person, exceeding the original plan. In Wujiaping of the first district, heroic cadres and party members took the lead, fully organizing the masses and formulating wheat planting plans by household. The whole village of 997 people planted a total of 516 mu of wheat, exceeding the plan of planting half a mu of wheat per person. Currently, the county has planted 610,616 mu of wheat, with each mu receiving an average of 40 to 60 loads of manure. The movement is underway and expanding. (Kou Cheng, Xin Ying)
    [Our Newspaper, Pingshun News] In Pingshun's fifth district, all the 169 mu of wheat should have been sown before the White Dew, but due to the rain and wet ground, cadres and masses had a negligent attitude, thinking that it wasn't too late to plant wheat. Based on this situation, the district held an emergency meeting of village chiefs and production directors on the ninth of this month to specifically discuss wheat planting. The old habit in the district was for livestock to plow half a day and rest half a day, with one team only being able to plow 2.5 to 3 mu per day. There was also a system of fixed plots, where one team of livestock was responsible for several households and a certain number of mu. Those responsible for fewer plots finished plowing early, while those responsible for more plots couldn't finish. The meeting studied solutions to these two problems and proposed "Three late harvests mean three less harvests": 1. If it rains a lot and the ground is wet, and if there is another rain, it will be even later, and there will definitely be less harvest next year. 2. If we continue with the old way of plowing half a day and resting half a day, it will take half a month to complete, which will be late and result in less harvest next year. 3. If we don't organize ourselves and continue with the previous system of whoever plows for whom, extending the time, it will also be late and result in less harvest. The meeting also studied methods to appropriately arrange the use of labor and livestock. The entire district accurately calculated that there were a total of 688 teams of livestock labor, and a total of 20,000 mu of wheat fields to be sown. Each team of livestock could plow an average of 4 mu per day, for a total of 2752 mu plowed per day. According to this calculation, it would take seven days to complete everything.
    In terms of organization: all labor and livestock resources should be organized, plowing should be done by area, with specialized plowing and specialized sowing, and manpower should be drawn out to pull drills. Small plots should be planted by people, with a "clean sweep" proposed, a complete village-wide shift of labor, and attention should be paid to prioritizing military dependents and revolutionary martyrs, especially southbound cadres.

    下桂花合理安排生活
    会啥干啥争取早种
    【本报黎城讯】一区下桂花村改茬种麦工作，在劳英高雨宽领导下，各组都做了周密计划合理安排生活，说干啥就干啥，如王路平善点种，就让他专门点麦，王松是犁地好把式，让他专门犁地，并组织人力起早搭黑担粪，高秃队用劳力八个，担粪六五○担，省牲口工三十二个，高进德队，人担粪，省下牲口去犁地。该村共土地三三七七亩，旧有麦地一一四九亩，现已下种七五八亩（内一六九小麦四七五亩，未下种三九一亩，今年全村扩大麦田四四三亩，连原有麦地共一五九二亩，占全部土地百分之四十七，秋分节内全部把改茬麦种完，口号是割一块改一块。
    在种麦中各组都订出了秋收秋耕计划，如高三勤队准备下种后趁庄稼未熟，抽空儿推几天磨，伙运几次煤，以免秋收时缺吃喝、烧燃，在秋收准备工作上，口号是黄一片割一片，割一块垡一块，争取在阴九月初五前完成秋收，霜降中把秋地全部垡完。（步衡、三星）
    【本报昔阳讯】县委发出大力种麦补救灾荒的号召后，各地在干部英雄党员的带头下，解决了群众对种麦不习惯、怕喝苦水、不顶事等思想顾虑，纷纷订出了计划。如三区东丰稔，在新英雄田世仁带头下，提出了“麦犁三遍顶上粪”等口号，组织群众开出荒地九十六亩，并种赶茬麦一百四十二亩，达到了每口人一亩麦，超过了原计划。一区武家坪英雄干部党员带头，全力组织群众，并以户订出种麦计划，全村九百九十七口人，共种麦五百一十六亩，超过了每口人种麦半亩计划。现全县种麦六十一万零六百一十六亩，每亩上粪均在四十至六十担，运动正在开展与扩大中。（叩成、新颖）
    【本报平顺讯】平顺五区在白露前一六九小麦都该下种，因天雨地湿，干部群众都存种麦不迟麻痹思想，区根据这种情况，本月九号召开村长生产主任紧急会议，专讨论种麦。该区旧习惯牲口犁地是犁半天歇半天，一犋一天只能犁二亩半到三亩，还有一种死代地，一犋牲口管几户，管多少亩数，管少的早犁完，管多的犁不完。研究了这两个问题解决办法，提出“三晚三少收，一、雨多地湿如果再下一场更晚了，明年一定要少收。二、照旧有的犁半天歇半天，完成得半个月，晚了明年少收。三、如不组织起来，还照以前谁代谁犁，延长时间，晚了亦要少收。又研究了做法，把劳畜力适当安排使用，全区精确计算，共有畜劳力六八八犋，共种麦田两万亩，每犋牲口平均一天犁四亩，一天共犁二千七百五十二亩，按这样计算，七天能全部完成。
    组织方面：把劳畜力全部组织起来，按片犁，犁专犁、种专种，抽出人力拉耧，小块地用人栽，提出一扫光，全村大变工，注意军干烈属特别是南下干部提先来完成。（张健、海忠）
