　　The People's Liberation Army Launches a Large-Scale Counter-Offensive

　　After a year and two months of interior operations and the large-scale annihilation of the enemy, the People's Liberation Army has launched a large-scale counter-offensive.

　　Just as the American imperialist bloodthirsty butcher, Wedemeyer, was coming to China to "investigate" with an attitude insulting to the Chinese people, encouraging the Chiang Kai-shek bandit group to abandon "contemptible defeatism," and intensify the civil war of slaughtering the Chinese people; just as Chiang Kai-shek issued the so-called "General Mobilization Order," boastfully attempting to launch his so-called "September Offensive," our heroic People's Liberation Army responded to them with a large-scale counter-offensive. In July, our Jilu Yu and Shandong People's Liberation Army began to attack, achieving victories in central and southern Shandong, especially in southwestern Shandong, continuously annihilating nine and a half enemy brigades, achieving an unprecedented great victory. On August 11, our troops under Generals Liu Bocheng, Deng Xiaoping, Xu Xiangqian, and Li Xiannian crossed the Longhai Railway, then crossed the Wo River, the Yellow River flood area, the Ying River, the Sha River, the Hong River, the Ru River, and the Huai River, as if entering an uninhabited land, and reached the Dabie Mountain area on August 27, shaking the north and south of the Yangtze River. On August 12, our northern Jiangsu People's Liberation Army won a great victory in Yancheng, annihilating the entire First Division of the Forty-Second Army of the Chiang puppet troops. On August 20, our Northwest People's Liberation Army under Generals Peng Dehuai, He Long, Xi Zhongxun, and Wang Shitai annihilated the Thirty-Sixth Division of Hu Zongnan's reorganized army north of Mizhi, and our army in the Northwest Theater turned to the counter-offensive. On August 23, our troops under Generals Chen Geng, Xie Fuzhi, Han Jun, Kong Congzhou, and Qin Jiwei crossed the Yellow River south between Luoyang and Shan County, entering the vast area south of the Longhai Railway, west of the Pinghan Railway, and north of the Han River. On September 8, our East China People's Liberation Army under Generals Chen Yi, Su Yu, Chen Shiqu, Tang Liang, and Ye Fei entered southwestern Shandong and annihilated the entire 57th Division of the Chiang army in Shatuji, east of Heze and south of Juancheng. Our People's Liberation Army on the southern front, from northern Jiangsu in the east to Shaanxi in the west, and reaching the Yangtze River in the south, has turned to the counter-offensive; the great liberation war in the provinces north of the Yangtze River has begun, and we have struck into Chiang Kai-shek's rear. The offensive of the People's Liberation Army on the southern front, coupled with the offensive on the northern section of the Pinghan Railway currently being carried out by our Jin-Chahar-Hebei People's Liberation Army, and the great offensive that our Northeast, Rehe, and eastern Hebei People's Liberation Army began as early as May, constitutes the overall situation of the People's Liberation Army's comprehensive counter-offensive.

　　The People's Liberation Army's large-scale counter-offensive marks a fundamental change in the war situation. Chiang Kai-shek's comprehensive offensive has been shattered and will never return. His boasted "September Offensive" has changed direction, becoming a comprehensive strategic offensive by the People's Liberation Army, while Chiang Kai-shek has turned to a passive position and is in an extremely precarious position due to popular opposition, weakened forces, and an empty rear.

　　In the process of less than two years since the Political Consultative Conference, especially in the year and two months since Chiang Kai-shek launched the full-scale civil war, Chiang Kai-shek's crimes of betraying the country, dictatorial rule, and harming the country and the people have been clearly recognized by the people of the whole country. The economic collapse and war disasters created by Chiang Kai-shek have left the people in the Chiang-controlled areas with no way to survive. This time, Wedemeyer came to China to implement the American imperialist policy of supporting Japanese aggression against China and further assisting Chiang's civil war, "supervising" the Chiang government to completely turn China into an American colony. The traitor Chiang Kai-shek did not hesitate to completely sell out the fruits of the sacrifices and struggles of the entire army and people during the eight-year war of resistance against Japan, and obeyed the will of American imperialism, agreeing to immediately trade with Japan, allowing the Japanese reactionaries to invade China again, and giving or preparing to give Taiwan, Hainan, Qingdao, Chengdu, Xi'an, Lanzhou, Tianshui and other places to American imperialism as military bases. The shameless crimes of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang have aroused the anger of the people of the whole country. The people of the whole country have not only distinguished between right and wrong in the civil war, but also seen the future of who will win and who will lose in the civil war. Therefore, they have recognized this truth: that in order to achieve their own liberation, they must overthrow the heinous rule of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. Overthrowing Chiang Kai-shek is the only way to have peace, overthrowing Chiang Kai-shek is the only way to have food, overthrowing Chiang Kai-shek is the only way to have democracy, and overthrowing Chiang Kai-shek is the only way to have independence. This has become common knowledge among the Chinese people.

　　As of the end of August, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's military strength, its regular army annihilated, had reached 114 brigades, or 900,000 men; the puppet troops, local armies, and special forces annihilated amounted to 353,000 men. That is to say, half of Chiang Kai-shek's regular army has been annihilated or suffered a devastating blow, and one-third of his puppet troops, local armies, and various forces have been annihilated. This has greatly weakened Chiang's military position. Not only is the morale of the bandit army low, but also all senior civil and military officials and the entire reactionary camp are filled with a sense of defeat. No future, no way out, disheartened and discouraged, panicking and wavering, hearing the wind and thinking it is rain, seeing trees and thinking they are soldiers, corruption is deepening, and mutual blaming and refusing to help in times of need. This is the current situation of the entire bandit den. If we fight for another year or two, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang will not be far from complete annihilation.（⑴⑵）

　　As for Chiang Kai-shek's rear, it is extremely empty. As of the end of August, of the 248 brigades of Chiang Kai-shek's regular army, 227 brigades had been used for front-line combat, and only 21 brigades remained in the rear, including eight brigades in Xinjiang and western Gansu, seven brigades in Sichuan and Xikang, two brigades in Yunnan, two brigades in Guangdong, and two brigades in Taiwan, that's all. There is not a single regular army in the six provinces of Hunan, Guangxi, Guizhou, Fujian, Zhejiang, and Jiangxi. Chiang Kai-shek has no second-line troops at all. One of the main reasons for Chiang Kai-shek's inevitable defeat lies here. The People's Liberation Army's large-scale counter-offensive to the provinces north of the Yangtze River, appearing in the rear of the Chiang army, exposed Chiang Kai-shek's weakness nakedly. Our People's Liberation Army advanced into the enemy's rear as if entering an uninhabited land, and forced Chiang Kai-shek to scramble and transfer troops from the front line to reinforce the rear. Many cities and strategic points in Chiang Kai-shek's rear that did not need to be defended in the past now have to be defended, which greatly dispersed Chiang Kai-shek's forces and greatly reduced his strategic mobile forces, forcing him to turn to defense in the overall strategy, leaving only some local offensives. This has created the necessary premise for the People's Liberation Army to annihilate the enemy in large numbers inside and outside the liberated areas, recover lost land, and liberate the masses of the people in new areas.

　　In summary, popular opposition, weakened forces, and an empty rear are Chiang Kai-shek's three fatal weaknesses. These weaknesses are the result of Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary policies of betraying the country, dictatorial rule, and civil war. In the past, Chiang Kai-shek was still in a strategic offensive position and could encourage his morale by attacking one place, but from now on, since the strategic offensive belongs to the People's Liberation Army, Chiang Kai-shek's collapse will inevitably accelerate. Because the People's Liberation Army has carried out interior operations for more than a year, annihilating a large number of enemies, and greatly strengthening and training itself. The liberated areas have become more consolidated because of the implementation of land reform, and the places temporarily occupied by him are still ours after the bandit army runs away. These conditions have created a favorable situation for the counter-offensive and laid the foundation for the complete elimination of all Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops in the future. The future of the demise of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang is set, and no help from American imperialism can save Chiang's fate.

　　Undoubtedly, in the war to liberate the provinces north of the Yangtze River, the People's Liberation Army will encounter many difficulties and must undergo a relatively long period of arduous struggle and annihilate a large number of Chiang's troops in order to achieve the goal of liberating the vast masses of oppressed people; however, these difficulties can be completely overcome and must be overcome.

　　All commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army expeditionary forces must understand how glorious and great the tasks they undertake are; they must be brave and good at fighting, obey orders, not be afraid of sacrifice, not be afraid of hardship, and annihilate the enemy in large numbers; they must closely unite with the local people, rectify mass discipline, strictly abide by the Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention, and strive wholeheartedly for the liberation of the people and the liberation of the nation.

　　The most glorious position for our staff is to go to the provinces north of the Yangtze River to work, implement correct policies, boldly mobilize the masses, destroy Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary rule, organize the broad masses of the people to establish people's democratic power, carry out land reform, arm the people, and cooperate with all patriotic and democratic elements from all walks of life.

　　Comrades in the military and civilians in the liberated areas! Continue to annihilate bandit troops inside and outside the liberated areas, recover lost land, expand the liberated areas, deepen land reform, increase production, practice strict economy, and support the front lines. Only by completely and thoroughly eliminating the Chiang bandits can the people in the liberated areas truly live and work in peace and contentment.

　　Compatriots in the Chiang-controlled areas! Unite to help the People's Liberation Army defeat the bandit troops. This victory will enable you to forever escape the painful life under the heinous rule of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang and realize the democratic liberation of the masses.

　　The great counter-offensive of the People's Liberation Army has begun, and the great war of liberation in the provinces north of the Yangtze River has begun. Strive for the victory of this great counter-offensive, and plant the flag of liberation all over China! Establish a democratic coalition government throughout the country! Long live the Chinese nation! Long live the liberation of the Chinese people!

### 人民解放军大举反攻

　　人民解放军大举反攻
    经过一年又两个月的内线作战，大量歼灭敌人之后，人民解放军大举反攻了。
    正当美国帝国主义者血腥屠夫魏德迈以侮辱中国人民的姿态来华“调查”，鼓励蒋介石强盗集团放弃“可鄙的失败主义”，加强屠杀中国人民的内战的时候；正当蒋介石发布所谓“总动员令”，自吹自擂企图发动他的所谓“九月攻势”的时候；我英勇的人民解放军却用大举反攻答复了他们。七月间，我们冀鲁豫及山东人民解放军开始出击，在鲁中、鲁南各地取得胜利，特别是在鲁西南，连续歼灭敌九个半旅，获得空前的大胜利。八月十一日，我刘伯承、邓小平、徐向前、李先念诸将军所部，越过陇海路，接着渡过涡河、黄汛区、颖河、沙河、洪河、汝河、淮河，如入无人之境，八月廿七日到达大别山地区，威震长江南北。八月十二日，我苏北人民解放军大捷于盐城，歼灭蒋伪军四十二集团军第一师全部。八月二十日，我彭德怀、贺龙、习仲勋、王世泰诸将军所部西北人民解放军，在米脂以北歼灭胡宗南之整编第三十六师，西北战场我军转入反攻。八月二十三日，我陈赓、谢富治、韩钧、孔从周、秦基伟诸将军所部，在洛阳、陕县间南渡黄河，进入陇海以南、平汉以西、汉水以北广大地区。九月八日，我陈毅、粟裕、陈士渠、唐亮、叶飞诸将军所部华东人民解放军，进入鲁西南，在菏泽以东、鄄城以南之沙土集歼灭蒋军五十七师全部。我人民解放军在南线诸战场上，东起苏北，西至陕西，南抵长江，已经转入反攻；长江以北诸省的伟大解放战争已经揭幕了，我们已经打到蒋介石的后方去了。人民解放军在南线诸战场的攻势，加上我晋察冀人民解放军现在正在进行的对平汉北段的攻势，我东北、热河、冀东人民解放军早已于五月间就开始了的伟大攻势，组成了人民解放军全面反攻的总形势。
    人民解放军的大举反攻，标志着战争形势的根本改变，蒋介石的全面攻势已被打得粉碎，已经一去不复返了；他所吹嘘的“九月攻势”换了个方向，变为人民解放军的全面的战略攻势了，蒋介石则转到被动地位，并且因为人民反对，兵力削弱与后方空虚，而处在极其危殆的地位。
    在政治协商会议以来，不到两年的过程中，特别在蒋介石发动全面内战以来的一年又两个月的过程中，蒋介石的卖国独裁、祸国殃民的罪行，已被全国人民所清楚认识。蒋介石所制造出来的经济崩溃与战争灾难，使蒋管区人民求生无路。此次魏德迈来华，执行美国帝国主义扶助日本侵略中国的政策，和更进一步助蒋内战，“监督”蒋政府把中国彻底变为美国殖民地的政策，卖国贼蒋介石竟不惜把八年抗战中全国军民牺牲奋斗的果实完全出卖，顺从美国帝国主义的意旨，同意与日本立即通商，让日本反动派再来侵略中国，把台湾、琼崖、青岛、成都、西安、兰州、天水等地，或者已经送给或者准备送给美国帝国主义作为军事基地。蒋介石匪帮的无耻罪行，激起全国人民的愤怒，全国人民不但已分清了内战中谁是谁非，而且也看清了内战中谁胜谁败的前途。因而认识了这一真理：即是要求得自己的解放，必须推翻蒋介石匪帮的万恶统治。打倒蒋介石才有和平，打倒蒋介石才有饭吃，打倒蒋介石才有民主，打倒蒋介石才有独立，已经是中国人民的常识了。
    蒋介石匪帮的兵力，其正规军被歼的到八月底止已达一百十四个旅，九十万人；伪军、地方军和特种部队被歼的三十五万三千人。这就是说，蒋介石的正规军已有一半曾被歼灭或受过歼灭性打击，其伪军地方军和各种部队已被歼灭三分之一。因而大大的削弱了蒋匪的军事地位，匪军们不但士气低落，而且在一切高级文武官员中、在整个反动派阵营中，都充满了失败情绪；没有前途、没有出路、灰心丧气、慌乱动摇、风声鹤唳、草木皆兵、贪污腐化愈陷愈深、互相埋怨见死不救，这就是整个匪窝营垒的现状，再打一年、两年，蒋介石匪帮就离全军覆灭不远了。（⑴⑵）
    至于蒋介石的后方，则是空虚到了极点。至八月底止，蒋介石的正规军二百四十八个旅中，用于前线作战的已达二百二十七个旅，留在后方的仅有二十一个旅，其中新疆及甘肃西部八个旅，川康七个旅，云南两个旅，广东两个旅，台湾两个旅，如此而已。湘、桂、黔、闽、浙、赣六省无一个正规军，蒋介石完全没有第二线部队。蒋介石必败的主要原因之一，就在这里。人民解放军向长江以北诸省大举反攻，出现于蒋军后方，就把蒋介石这个弱点赤裸裸地暴露出来。我人民解放军向敌人后方前进如入无人之境，而且逼着蒋介石不得不手忙脚乱，从第一线调兵向后方增援。蒋介石后方有许多城市和战略要点，从前是不要防守的，现在却必须派兵防守，这就使蒋介石的兵力大大分散，战略机动兵力大大减少，不得不在战略上全局转入防御，剩下的只有某些局部的地方性攻势，这就给人民解放军在解放区内外大量歼灭敌人，收复失地和解放新地区人民大众，造成必要的前提。
    总起来说，人民反对、兵力削弱、后方空虚，这就是蒋介石的三个致命弱点，这些弱点是蒋介石的卖国独裁内战的反动政策的结果。蒋介石在已往还处于战略攻势地位，还能以进攻一地来鼓励他的士气，但是从今以后战略攻势既然属于人民解放军方面，蒋介石的崩溃必然加速。由于人民解放军在一年多的时间中进行了内线作战，大量歼灭了敌人，大大加强和锻炼了自己。解放区因为实行土地改革而更加巩固，一时被他占领的地方，匪军一跑仍然是我们的。这些条件，又造成了反攻的有利形势，奠定了今后彻底消灭蒋介石全部匪军的基础。蒋介石匪帮的覆没的前途是定了的，美国帝国主义的任何帮助也不能挽救蒋匪的这个命运。
    毫无疑问，在解放长江以北各省的战争中，人民解放军将会遇到许多困难，并须经过一个较长时间的艰苦奋斗，大量歼灭蒋军，才能达到解放广大被压迫人民群众的目的；但是，这些困难是完全可以克服与必须克服的。
    我人民解放军出征部队的全体指战员，必须明了自己所担负的任务是何等光荣、何等伟大；必须英勇善战，服从命令，不怕牺牲，不怕劳苦，大量歼灭敌人；必须和当地人民群众亲密结合，整饬群众纪律，严格遵守三大纪律八项注意，全心全意为人民的解放与民族的解放奋斗。
    我们的工作人员的最光荣的位置，是到长江以北各省中去工作，实行正确的政策，放手发动群众，摧毁蒋介石反动统治，组织广大人民建立人民的民主政权，进行土地改革，武装人民并与各阶层的一切爱国的民主分子合作。
    解放区的军民同胞们！继续在解放区内外歼灭匪军，收复失地，扩大解放区，深入土地改革，增加生产，厉行节约，支援前线，只有把蒋匪彻底的、全部的消灭了，解放区人民才能真正安居乐业。
    蒋管区同胞们！一致起来援助人民解放军战胜匪军，这个胜利将使你们永远脱离蒋介石匪帮万恶统治下的痛苦生活，实现人民群众的民主解放。
    人民解放军伟大的反攻已经开始，长江以北各省伟大的解放战争已经开始。争取这个大反攻的胜利，把解放的旗帜插到全中国！把民主的联合政府在全国范围内建立起来！中华民族万岁！中国人民解放万岁！
