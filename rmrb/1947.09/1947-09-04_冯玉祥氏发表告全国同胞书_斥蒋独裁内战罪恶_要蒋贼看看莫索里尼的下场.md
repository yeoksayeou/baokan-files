Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st (Delayed News): In early June, General Feng Yuxiang published a letter to the nation in the United States, vehemently denouncing the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique for overturning the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, implementing civil war, dictatorship, and oppression of dissidents, and eliminating miscellaneous troops, pointing out that Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorial civil war is bound to fail. The following is an excerpt from the original letter published in the "Tsinghua Weekly" of Tsinghua University in Beiping:

　　"To the compatriots of the whole country via the San Francisco World Daily: This morning, I read the San Francisco English newspapers and the World Daily and learned that many petitioning young students were injured and killed in Nanjing.

　　Young students are the young masters of the Republic of China. Because they are not getting enough to eat and wear, they sincerely say to the servants, "Don't fight wars." This is their duty, and they should have this right. Servants killing masters, servants beating masters, this is a complete act of rebellion.

　　Yuxiang is a member of the Kuomintang. Every member of the Kuomintang should speak the truth based on their own conscience. Since overturning the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference last year and starting the civil war, look at our internal situation: the civil unrest in Taiwan, how many of our Taiwanese compatriots were killed, and many officials also died. As for killing county magistrates and seizing rice, there are many more incidents. If there is no civil war, would these things happen? Regarding economic matters, two thousand and twenty yuan of legal tender could be exchanged for one U.S. dollar, and recently it has reached twenty-eight thousand to thirty thousand (now it is fifty thousand - editor). No matter how fast civil servants' salaries increase, they cannot keep up with the price of rice. How can people live like this? Is it any wonder that people are搶 rice?

　　Even though they are the same army, the treatment is different. An army corps is reduced to an army, an army is reduced to a division, and a division is reduced to a brigade, and the result is dispersal. Deliberately making things worse, the morale of the army is extremely scattered. Many knowledgeable and meritorious officers go to cry at the mausoleum. Not getting enough to eat and wear, wearing cotton clothes in the summer and single clothes in the winter, why do so many soldiers, in formations of armies, divisions, regiments, and battalions, go over to the Communist Party? It is because they do not treat soldiers as human beings.

　　Not treating the people as masters, what kind of republic is this? As long as they are relatives, clansmen, or fellow villagers, anything can be done; conversely, no matter how virtuous and capable you are, you will not be used. If things continue like this, if there is no corruption, what can be said? If there is no chaos, what can be said?

　　In party affairs (referring to the Kuomintang), one cannot see where the principles are. When a comrade went on stage to speak at a meeting in Chongqing, someone said to drag him out and shoot him, and told him to get out.

　　Madam Sun Yat-sen, Soong Ching-ling, advocates for peace and democracy and against civil war, so rumors are used to attack Madam Sun. Ms. He Xiangning's speeches are all subject to various inspections and detentions. Who with knowledge throughout the country does not feel pain?

　　After the victory, conscription of soldiers and grain is carried out arbitrarily. If the grain is taken away, what will the people eat? If the son is taken away, how will this family survive? If the people are all dead, what use is the (Chiang) government? Heaven sees as the people see, Heaven hears as the people hear. Violating the will of the people is violating the will of Heaven. If you violate the will of Heaven, can you not fail?

　　Creating rumors and making trouble, calling white black, this is the worst thing. Recently, eight or nine out of ten newspaper offices are controlled by one person. Newspapers with backbone are either closed or suspended. Those who advocate fairness are said to be the tail of the Communist Party. Those who advocate that civil war cannot be fought are ordered to retire and told to leave. Our (referring to the Kuomintang) secret agents are all over the place, in all walks of life, several times more powerful than the East and West Factories (Note: Wei Zhongxian's secret service organization) in the late Ming Dynasty. If there is the slightest dissatisfaction with them, some disappear, some are buried alive. In short, all of the above are true. Hitler and Mussolini had no way out, what was the result? Mussolini once called a meeting of his relatives and close associates, and twelve out of thirteen people advocated that he leave. Can this not serve as a lesson?"

### 冯玉祥氏发表告全国同胞书　斥蒋独裁内战罪恶  要蒋贼看看莫索里尼的下场

　　冯玉祥氏发表告全国同胞书
  　斥蒋独裁内战罪恶
    要蒋贼看看莫索里尼的下场
    【新华社陕北一日电】（迟到消息）六月初冯玉祥将军在美国发表告全国同胞书，痛斥蒋介石反动集团推翻政协决议，实行内战，独裁及压迫异己、消灭杂牌军的罪恶，指出蒋介石的独裁内战必然失败。兹根据北平清华大学刊物“清华周刊”所刊原函节录如下：
    “旧金山世界日报转全国同胞公鉴：今早读三藩市英文报和世界日报，得悉南京打伤和打死许多请愿的青年学生。
    青年学生是中华民国的青年主人，因为吃不饱、穿不暖，诚恳的向仆人们说：“你们不要打仗，”这是他们的本分，他们应当有这个权利。仆人杀主人，仆人打主人，这是彻底的反叛行动。
    玉祥是国民党员，在国民党的每个党员，都应当本着自己的天良来说真话。自去年推翻政协决议，开始打内战以来，看看我们的内部，台湾的民变，杀死我们台湾多少同胞，还死了许多官员。至于杀县长抢米，还有很多。不打内战，那里有这个事情？经济的事，由两千二十元法币换一元美金，最近到了两万八千至三万了（现在是五万了——编者）。公务员的薪水怎么涨亦赶不上米价涨的那样快，这样人民怎样活呢？还怪人民抢米吗？
    同是一样的军队，待遇不同。一个集团军缩成一军，一军缩成一师，一师缩一旅，结果是拨散了。故意的弄糟糕，军心涣散到极点，许多有知识有功勋的军官去哭陵。吃不饱、穿不暖，夏天穿棉衣，冬天穿单衣，为什么许多军人成军成师成团成营的到共产党里头去？就是因为拿着军人太不当人看。
    不拿人民当主人，这是什么民国？只要是亲戚、本家、乡亲，什么事情都能做；反之，任你有什么贤能也不用，这样下去，不贪污，说什么？不混乱，说什么？
    党务（指国民党）看不见主义在那里，在重庆开大会时，一位同志上台说话，有人说拉出去枪毙他，叫他滚出去。
    孙夫人宋庆龄女士主张和平民主不打内战，便对孙夫人用谣言来攻击；何香凝女士的发言都被种种检查扣留，全国有识之人谁不痛心？
    胜利以后又随便征兵征粮。粮征走了人民吃什么？儿子抓走了这一家怎么过呢？人民都死光了，（蒋）政府还有什么用？天视自我民视，天听自我民听，违背了民意就是违背了天意，违背了天意，还有能不失败的吗？
    造谣生事，指白为黑，这是最坏的事。近来报馆，十之八九操于一人之手，有硬骨的报纸不是封闭便是停刊，主张公道的，说他是共产党的尾巴。主张不能打内战的，就令他退伍，叫他走开。我们（指国民党）特务满布各地各界，比明末的时候东厂西厂（注：系魏忠贤的特务组织）还厉害若干倍。一点不满他们的意，失踪的失踪，活埋的活埋。总而言之，以上各条都是实在的事情。希特拉、莫索里尼没办法了，得到什么结果呢？莫索里尼曾召集他的亲人近人开会，十三个人中有十二个主张他走开的，还不能当教训吗？”
