[Reported by our newspaper from Taiyue on the 22nd] The news of the great victory on the southern front has spread to various places, causing universal jubilation and ecstasy. Five days ago, this reporter set off from Xiangyuan and traveled south along the Baijin Road. Villages were filled with the sound of gongs and drums, celebrating the victory. In particular, the village broadcasting stations were broadcasting the day's victory news from one village to the next. Therefore, during the five-day journey, although there was no time to read the newspaper, these broadcasting stations promptly informed everyone of the day's victory news. This reporter stayed overnight in Gaoping, in Xiaoyichuan Village. At this time, the cooperative was broadcasting the victory news. When one piece of news was finished, a young man in his twenties suddenly jumped up and down, cheering and applauding, shouting dozens of times: "A great victory! A great victory!" Then, the gongs and drums that had been prepared were sounded, and the string music also began to play. All the young men and women naturally started to dance the Yangko one after another. One of them sang loudly: "The main force goes south, the enemy trembles, Chiang Kai-shek is finished." At this moment, someone shouted: "Folks, we have won, but in order to achieve greater victories, we must prepare a second batch of people to join the war. As soon as the order comes, we can set off immediately." Immediately, the gongs and drums stopped, the string music stopped, and the noise subsided. What followed was a discussion about joining the war, with everyone vying to go to the front line. An old man said: "No need to argue, your whole team can go, I, the old man, will take care of things at home!" Then the gongs and drums sounded again, the string music sounded, and the singing began. The next day, when this reporter left the village, I discovered an extraordinary event. All the villages were suddenly quiet, men and women were completely in the fields plowing and sowing wheat. In particular, the mutual aid teams were first sowing the land of those who had gone out, and then quickly sowing and harvesting their own land, preparing to go to the front.

    白晋线上无闲村
    准备参战快收种
    【本报太岳二十二日电】南线大胜利的消息传到各地后，万众欢腾，欣喜若狂。记者前五天从襄垣起身，沿白晋路南下，村村锣鼓喧天，庆祝胜利，尤其是各村的广播台，在一村传一村的播送着当天的胜利消息，所以在五天的行程中，虽然没有时间读到报纸，但这些广播台及时的告知了当天的胜利消息。记者至高平住宿，在小宜川村，此时合作社内正在播送着胜利消息，在一个消息播完时，忽然有个二十来岁的青年连蹦带跳的欢呼鼓掌，连叫数十声：“打的好！打的好！”接着，就是已经准备妥当的锣鼓响起来了，弦乐也响起来了，所有年青男人、女人很自然的一个跟一个扭起秧歌来，其中有一人高唱：“大军南下贼胆寒，蒋贼介石一命完。”就在这时，又有人大叫：“老乡们，胜利了，可是咱们为了获得更大的胜利，必须再准备第二批参战的人，等命令一来，就能马上出发。”立刻锣鼓停了，弦乐停了，噪杂声也息了，代之而起的是你一言、我一语的讨论起参战的事情来，个个抢着上前线。老汉说：“不用争论，你们大队人都去，家里由俺老汉负责！”于是又响起锣鼓、响起弦乐、唱起歌声来。第二天，记者出村时，又发现了一种不平凡的事情，所有村子忽然静静的，男男女女，完全在地里犁地种麦，尤其是互助组要先把外出人的地种了，又赶快种起收起自己的地，准备投奔前线去。
