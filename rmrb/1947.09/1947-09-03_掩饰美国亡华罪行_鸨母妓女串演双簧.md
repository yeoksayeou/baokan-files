Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th. A Xinhua News Agency reporter comments: The Chiang Kai-shek clique's recent performances following Wedemeyer's statement indicate that the US and Chiang are staging a vaudeville act reminiscent of Shanghai's Great World's Lu Qiqi and Zhang Xixi. The US imperialists know that "corruption" and "incompetence" are inextricably linked to the Chiang Kai-shek clique. Asking this festering Chiang Kai-shek to "reform" is like trying to thread a needle with a camel. So, why does the "practical efficiency"-obsessed Uncle Sam insist that his son do something utterly impossible? There are only two purposes: First, to create a pretext for the US imperialist authorities to give the Chiang Kai-shek clique's chamber pot a slight whitewash, so that they can swaggeringly pour arms and loans into Chiang Kai-shek's bottomless pit. Second, Wedemeyer's feigned "severity," "impartiality," and flowery words about "the Chinese people's desire for peace" are intended to assuage the anger of the Chinese and American people towards the US imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek's rotten rule. On the 27th, the Christian Science Monitor let the cat out of the bag: "Wedemeyer's statement did not close the door to aiding Chiang against the Communists." At the same time, the New York Times bluntly stated: "Chiang 'Chairman' has many capable 'authorities' and staff who are 'absolutely' competent to reform." The truth is out: Chiang Kai-shek and the Four Families are all good and "authoritative"; the only bad ones are the generally "incompetent" lower-level staff and "local government" personnel, who need only be slightly "reformed."
　　After the pimp sang for a while, the prostitute came on stage, led by Sun Ke and Wu Tiecheng, to perform a civilized drama of prostitute improvement. The theme is "eliminating corruption" and "strictly enforcing regulations against corruption." This has several unspoken "benefits": each group can take this opportunity to vent their anger on their respective enemies, and "eliminating corruption" will be "very successful." In the future, we may see many jokes of Whampoa cadets exposing CC cliques, or the Political Science Clique dragging down the Kong-Soong group. After that, the dissatisfied pimp returns, sings another tune, and then comes the so-called "reorganization" where the clown sings the role of the dignified old man, and the painted face sings the role of the young woman. A United Press dispatch on the 27th stated: "Wedemeyer's criticism will be thoroughly digested by the KMT Central Committee members, who will meet soon to partially reorganize the KMT-controlled 'coalition government.'" Sun Ke was even more outstanding. In his interview with the Central News Agency in Guangzhou, he said: "Sun dispelled all doubts that Wedemeyer's statement was a prelude to the US completely stopping aid to China (Chiang)." He emphasized that the "special envoy's" main task was to determine how the US should aid China. Therefore, Wu Tiecheng was moved to tears: "General Wedemeyer's remarks are frank and sincere," thus Wedemeyer's instructions are nothing more than a vaudeville act.
　　However, the highlight of the vaudeville act is still Sun Ke. Wedemeyer's grand pronouncements of "peace" are primarily aimed at buying time, giving Chiang Kai-shek a chance to reorganize and equip his troops to strengthen his offensive. But he knows that achieving this goal will be extremely difficult. So, he has to settle for second best: First, aid to Chiang and the civil war are inseparable, and the amount of aid and the scale of the civil war are also inseparable. But this requires an excuse to persuade the financial bosses in the US who are wary of the bottomless pit; second, to maintain the status of Uncle Sam, he has to give some advice, but if the words are too harsh, it may produce "despicable defeatism" and internal demoralization among the puppets. Therefore, there must be a splendid performance, both to convince the bosses and to boost the morale of the lackeys. This requires a face that is different from the CC clique and the Whampoa clique to speak. Just as the most exciting program in a modern zoo is foreigners and animals performing together, Sun Ke, after playing the prostitute, appeared as a monkey. Wedemeyer sings in the back, "Tell him to make peace"? Sun Ke rolls around the stage: "Fight! Fight!" "The Communist Party must be pacified by force." There will be some difference between the open fascist leader Chiang Kai-shek singing "it will be over after the fight" and Sun Ke, who prostitutes himself as a "liberal," singing "fight to the end." Following this, we can expect the pimp to come on stage for the third time, and then will come the money and weapons.
　　The reporter concludes: Wedemeyer's reputation has been bankrupted in all aspects, and the Chiang Kai-shek court has been declared bankrupt by all parties. This also finally declares the final bankruptcy of a group of prostitutes and monkeys like Sun Ke. The people will push them from complete bankruptcy into eternal tombs.

### 掩饰美国亡华罪行　鸨母妓女串演双簧

　　掩饰美国亡华罪行
  　鸨母妓女串演双簧
    【新华社陕北卅日电】新华社记者评论：魏德迈声明之后蒋家小朝廷的连日种种做唱，正表示美蒋双方在上演上海大世界陆奇奇张嘻嘻之类的双簧戏。美帝国主义者明知“贪污”“颟顸无能”是与蒋集团根本无法分解的东西，因而要这个满身溃疮的蒋介石来“改革”，是等于牵着大骆驼穿针眼。那么满口“实际效率”的花旗老子，为什么一定要儿子做一番绝不可能的事呢？这目的只有两个：一方面，替美帝国主义当局制造借口，以便替蒋介石集团的马桶盖略加粉刷之后，就可以大摇大摆的将军火及贷款投入蒋介石的无底洞；另一方面，魏德迈的假模假样的“严厉”“公正”与“中国人民渴望和平”等等的花言巧语，正是为的想缓和中国人民和美国人民对美帝国主义和蒋介石这臭腐统治的愤怒。二十七日，美科学箴言报就泄漏了天机：“魏德迈声明并未关闭援蒋反共之门”。同时，纽约时报就直截了当道出：“蒋‘主席’之有许多具有能力的‘权威’与幕僚，是‘绝对’胜任改革的”。真心话就说出来了，蒋介石和四大家族都是好的、“权威”的，坏的仅是一般“颟顸无能”的底下职员，“地方政府机构”人员须略加“改革”而已。
    鸨母唱了一阵之后，婊子于是跟着上场，以孙科、吴铁城为首，就大表演其妓女改良的文明戏。这题目叫做“清除贪污”和“厉行惩治贪污条例。”这有几个心照不宣的“好处”：各个集团可以乘此机会来将每人的眼中钉出出气，同时“肃清贪污”就“很有成绩”了。我们今后可以看到不少黄埔检举ＣＣ，或政学系拖着孔宋集团之类的笑话。这之后，鸨母不满意的回来了，再一阵做唱，随之而来的大概就会是丑角唱须生，花脸唱花旦的所谓“改组”。美联社二十七日电：“魏德迈的批评，将被国民党中委们彻底消化，他们将于最近开会，以部分改组国民党控制的‘联合政府’”。孙科就更出色了，他在广州对中央社记者谈话：“孙氏一扫外间对魏德迈声明误会了美国将完全停止援华（蒋）之前奏之一切疑窦，渠强调‘特使’之主要任务，乃在确定美国应如何援助中国。”因此，吴铁城感激涕零了：“魏德迈将军的谈话是坦白而真挚”，因此魏德迈所指点的，不过是一幕双簧而已。
    然而双簧的压轴戏仍是孙科。魏德迈的大放“和平”厥词，最上目的固是想求取一段缓兵时间，给蒋介石重新整顿与装备部队以加强进攻的机会，但他知道这目的的达成将万分困难。于是他只好求其次了：一、援蒋与内战不可分，而内战与援蒋的数量又不可分，可是这必须有所借口，来说服美国国内对无底洞望而却步的一班财政老板；二、为保持花旗老子的身份，固不得不有所训诲，然而语句太重，又可能产生娃娃们当中“可鄙的失败主义”与内部泄气的副作用。于是就必须有精彩表演，上以说服老板，下以给喽＠打气。这就须要与众不同的和ＣＣ、黄埔等稍为有别的嘴脸来说话。等于新式动物园的最精彩节目是洋人与动物合串一样，孙科表演过婊子之后，就以猢狲姿态出现了。魏德迈在后边唱“要他和了罢”？孙科就满场打滚：“打！打！”“非以武力勘平共党不可”。由公开法西斯头子蒋介石来唱“打完了亦完”与以“自由主义者”资格卖淫的孙科来唱“打到底”，是会有一些分别的。跟着，我们可以预料鸨母第三次又会上场，铜板和刀枪就会来了。
    记者最后指出：魏德迈在各方面的声誉破产，和蒋家朝廷的被各方面宣布破产，也最后宣告了一群婊子猢狲如孙科之流的最后破产。人民将把他们由完全破产推入永远的坟墓。
