Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 8th: A spokesman for the People's Liberation Army headquarters told reporters today that in July and August, our army annihilated a total of five division headquarters, sixteen brigades, and two battalions or more of the enemy's regular army; and, according to incomplete statistics, ten regiments and one battalion or more of non-regular army troops. Including those below the battalion level, according to incomplete statistics, a total of more than 124,000 regular enemy troops and more than 13,000 non-regular enemy troops were annihilated. The aforementioned regular enemy troops annihilated include the entire 38th Brigade of the 59th Division annihilated in Lunan in July; the headquarters of the 55th Division and its entire 29th Brigade and 74th Brigade, the headquarters of the 32nd Division and its entire 193rd Brigade (formerly renamed the 149th Brigade), and the entire 141st Brigade, the headquarters of the 70th Division and its entire 139th Brigade (minus one regiment) and 140th Brigade, the headquarters of the 66th Division and its entire 13th Brigade, 185th Brigade, and 199th Brigade annihilated in Southwestern Shandong; and the headquarters of the 36th Division and its entire 123rd Brigade and most of the 165th Brigade (those who fled amounted to about one regiment) annihilated in Northern Shaanxi in August. In addition, there was one brigade each from the 8th Shandong Division and the 22nd Army of Northern Shaanxi, about one brigade from the 11th Shandong Division, and other units annihilated in entire regiments and battalions. Among the regular enemy officers captured during the two months were twelve generals, including Li Mingya, lieutenant general and deputy division commander of the 55th Division, Chen Yiding and Luo Zhedong, lieutenant generals, division commander and deputy division commander of the 70th Division, Song Ruike, lieutenant general and division commander of the 66th Division, Zhai Zifeng, major general and brigade commander of the 38th Brigade of the 59th Division (bombed to death by Chiang's aircraft after capture), Guo Yulin and Wang Kaishi, major generals and chief of staff and deputy chief of staff of the 66th Division, Wang Shiqiao, major general and brigade commander of the 199th Brigade, Tu Huantao, major general and brigade commander of the 185th Brigade, Ma Yongzhi, major general and chief of staff, Long Shuping, major general and chief of staff of the 13th Brigade, and Liu Ziqi, major general and brigade commander of the 123rd Brigade of the 36th Division. Eleven non-regular army generals were captured, including Li Dongqin, major general and chief of staff of the 3rd Division of the Northeast Cavalry 1st Army, Wang Quanjing, major general and commander of the Bo'ai Self-Defense Corps in Henan, Zhang Honghui, major general-level county magistrate, Tang Zhen, major general and deputy commander of the Meng County Self-Defense Corps, Lu Jiawu, major general and commander of the 5th Security Corps of Henan, Zhang Ziying, major general and deputy commander of the Shaanxi Garrison Command, Xu Shaolin, major general-level county magistrate of Jingzao County, Han Yinming, major general and chief of staff of the 42nd Army Group in Northern Jiangsu, and Li Tiemin and Peng Dingyi, major generals, division commander and deputy division commander of the 1st Division of that army, and Yang Nianxi, major general-level specialist of the News Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense. Two regular enemy generals were killed, namely Zhou Shutang, major general and brigade commander of the 139th Brigade of the 32nd Division, and Tan Daoshan, major general and brigade commander of the 18th Brigade of the 11th Division; one non-regular army general killed was Zuo Jiantang, major general and deputy army commander and commander of the 79th Division of the Northeast New 27th Army. The spokesman pointed out that as a result of the operations in the past two months, from July of last year to August of this year, the total number of regular enemy troops annihilated at or above the battalion level has reached 114 brigades (minus one regiment) and 14 division headquarters, with a total of approximately 1.26 million troops annihilated. In July alone, four enemy division headquarters and more than thirteen brigades were annihilated, including ten entire brigades. This glorious achievement broke past records and created conditions for a counter-offensive on the southern front. In August, because some of our corps were in transit and some were resting, fewer enemies were annihilated; however, in Northern Shaanxi alone, three enemy brigades were annihilated, and in the enemy's rear in Northern Jiangsu, one non-regular division (equivalent to one reorganized brigade) was annihilated, breaking records in both areas and creating conditions for a counter-offensive in the Northwest and a new situation in Northern Jiangsu. Therefore, the entire situation on the southern front has undergone fundamental changes in the months of July and August.

　　我军七八两月战绩辉煌
  　歼灭蒋军十三万余
    造成南线反攻有利条件
    【新华社陕北八日电】人民解放军总部发言人今日告记者称：七、八两月份我军共歼敌营以上正规军合五个师部，十六个旅又两个营，营以上非正规军据不完全统计合十个团，一个营，连同营以下计算，据不完全统计，共歼灭敌兵力正规军十二万四千余人，非正规军一万三千余人。上述敌被歼正规军，包括七月在鲁南被歼的五十九师三十八旅全部；在鲁西南被歼的五十五师师部及其二十九旅、七十四旅全部，三十二师师部及其一九三旅（按曾改称一四九旅），一四一旅全部，七十师师部及其一三九旅（缺一个团）与一四○旅全部，六十六师师部及其十三旅、一八五旅、一九九旅全部；八月在陕北被歼的三十六师师部及其一二三旅全部与一六五旅大部（溃逃者约合一个团）。此外尚有山东八师与陕北二十二军之各合一个旅，山东十一师约一个旅，及其他整团整营被歼的部队。敌被歼非正规军包括七月被歼的东北骑一军第三师两个团；河南博爱自卫总队全部，交警十七总队两个大队；八月被歼的苏北四十二集团军第一师全部；河北正定安大队全部，及其他部队。两月间俘敌正规军将级军官十二名，计为五十五师中将副师长理明亚，七十师中将正副师长陈颐鼎、罗哲东，六十六师中将师长宋瑞珂，五十九师三十八旅少将旅长翟紫封（俘后被蒋机炸死），六十六师少将正副参谋长郭雨林、王开石、一九九旅少将旅长王仕翘、一八五旅少将旅长涂焕陶、少将参谋长马用之、十三旅少将参谋长龙叔平、三十六师一二三旅少将旅长刘子奇。俘非正规军将级军官十一名计为东北骑一军三师少将参谋长李东亲、河南博爱自卫总队少将总队长王泉清、少将级县长张宏惠、孟县自卫总队少将副总队长汤震、河南保安五总队少将总队长卢家武、陕北警备司令部少将副司令张子英、靖澡县少将级县长徐绍林、苏北四十二集团军总部少将参谋长韩尹明及该军一师少将正副师长李铁民、彭定一、国防部新闻局少将级专员杨念熙。毙敌正规军将级军官二名，计为三十二师一三九旅少将旅长周树棠、十一师十八旅少将旅长覃道善；非正规军将级军官一名为东北新二十七军少将副军长兼七十九师师长左建堂。发言人指出：由于过去两个月的作战，自去年七月起至今年八月止，敌被歼营以上正规军总额已达一百十四个旅（欠一个团）又十四个师部，其全部被歼灭兵力约达一百二十六万人。仅在今年七月一个月内，即歼敌正规军四个师部又十三个旅强，包括十个整旅，这个光辉的战绩，打破了过去的纪录，造成了南线反攻的条件。八月份因我若干兵团正在进军运动中，若干兵团正在休整，故歼敌较少；但仅陕北一处即歼敌三个旅，苏北敌后亦歼敌一个非正规师（合一个整编旅），打破了两区的纪录，造成了西北反攻的条件与苏北的新局面。因此南线的整个形势在七八两月中已发生了根本变化。
