Large Sale of Lithographic Stones

The lithographic stones created by our bookstore are of excellent quality. After multiple experiments, the effect is no different from foreign lithographic stones. In order to support the development of printing in various regions, we are mass-producing and selling them at low prices. The price of each No. 3 stone is 400 jin of rice. Those paying in cash will be calculated at the market price. Reservations and orders are welcome. If you would like to patronize us, please contact our bookstore.
