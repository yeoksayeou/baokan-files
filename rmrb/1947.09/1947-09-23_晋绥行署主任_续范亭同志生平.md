(Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, 20th) Comrade Xu Fanting, Director of the Jin-Sui Administrative Office, loved the country and cherished the people, was loyal and devoted to the revolution, and gave his all. His life is briefly described as follows: Director Xu was born on October 20, 1893, in Xishe Village, Yuanqu County, Shanxi Province, to a middle-peasant family. After graduating from higher primary school, he entered the Taiyuan Military Academy and later engaged in revolutionary activities with revolutionary martyrs Xu Xifeng and Hu Liseng, joining the Tongmenghui. During the Xinhai Revolution, he served as the captain of the Shanxi Expeditionary Force and defended Datong. In the third year of the Republic of China, he was wanted by the bandit Yuan Shikai, who stole the country, and was not tolerated by the feudal warlord Yan Xishan. He left Shanxi and spared no effort to overthrow Yuan and Yan, working tirelessly for the revolution. In the thirteenth year of the Republic of China, after the establishment of the National Army in the North, he served as the Chief of Staff of the Detachment, the Commander of the Sixth Mixed Brigade, and the Executive Member of the Highest Special Party Department of the Kuomintang. In the fourteenth year of the Republic of China, he founded the Beijing National News. In the sixteenth year of the Republic of China, he served as the principal of the Military and Political School of the National Army. In the twenty-first year of the Republic of China, he served as the Chief of Staff of the Gansu Pacification Office. When he served as the Chief of Staff of the newly编First Army, it was when the Japanese invaders were trying to occupy North China. Director Xu witnessed the deepening national crisis and hated the Nanjing government's shameless betrayal of the country. At the end of the twenty-fourth year, he was so grief-stricken that he committed suicide by cutting his abdomen at the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum in Nanjing, which shocked the whole country. His suicide note included the lines, "Fearing that the people's spirit will be completely destroyed, I am willing to exchange my body for freedom"; and "It is most shameful to die in battle without a general, and it is worthless to preserve one's life for the sake of revenge!" The words were stern, and the spirit was high, intending to arouse the people to resolutely resist Japan and save the country, and oppose Chiang Kai-shek's capitulation and betrayal of the country. Although Director Xu was rescued, he suffered internal injuries, which became a chronic illness. While recuperating in Hangzhou, he devoted himself to reading social science books and studying the problems of the Chinese revolution, which strengthened his will to fight for the cause of the people. Afterwards, despite all kinds of slander and persecution by the reactionaries, he still ran around calling for an end to the civil war and united resistance against Japan, and his belief remained unchanged. In the autumn of the twenty-fifth year, he returned to Xi'an and participated in the Xi'an Incident. When the July 7th Incident broke out, he returned to Shanxi, promoted the Shanxi National Salvation Movement, and established the Second War Zone National Revolutionary War Front Mobilization Committee, serving as the chairman, and fully supported the Shanxi Anti-Japanese War situation. Before the fall of Taiyuan, he came to northwestern Shanxi, concurrently serving as the commander of the Second District Security of Shanxi, and later as the commander of the Provisional First Division, cooperating with General He Long and Guan Xiangying of the 120th Division of the Eighth Route Army to carry out guerrilla warfare and mass movements, and jointly establish the anti-Japanese base area in northwestern Shanxi. In the twenty-eighth year, the domestic trend of capitulation and compromise rose, and the Mobilization Committee was unreasonably canceled by Yan Xishan. Director Xu immediately led the Mobilization Committee and the Provisional First Division of the New Army to fight in Wuzhai and Ningwu, resolutely opposing the capitulation and compromise conspiracy of the Chiang Kai-shek Yan reactionaries. When the Jinxi Incident occurred, he and the 120th Division of the Eighth Route Army and the people of the border region drove away Zhao Chengshou. After the establishment of the Jin-Sui Border Region Administrative Office, he was supported by the people of the entire region as the director of the Administrative Office, and also served as the deputy commander of the Jin-Sui Military Region. In the summer of the thirtieth year, he went to Yan'an for recuperation due to overwork. During his illness, he still cared for and guided the people and work in the Jin-Sui Border Region at all times, and he never forgot the overall situation of the national war. Whenever the situation turned against him, he was filled with righteous indignation and shouted loudly. In the thirty-second year, when the crisis of civil war was serious, even though he was lying in bed coughing up blood, he still picked up his pen and wrote straight to warn those who provoked the civil war to turn back from the brink. In the thirty-third year, he published his famous "Five Thousand Words Letter to Yan Xishan, the Soil Emperor of Shanxi," condemning Yan's crime of selling out the country and oppressing the people. Director Xu has been engaged in the revolution for more than thirty years, adhering to the struggle against imperialism and feudalism, and being loyal to the realization of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary Three People's Principles. From a member of the Tongmenghui to joining the Communist Party, he represents the path taken by a Chinese revolutionary. Director Xu is survived by his wife, Ms. Xu Yunong, and one daughter and four sons. The eldest daughter, Xu Bi, is a member of the Communist Party and is currently a reporter for the Northeast Daily in Harbin. The four sons are still young.
