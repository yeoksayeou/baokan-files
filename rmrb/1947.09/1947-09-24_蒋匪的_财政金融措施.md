Xinhua News Agency, September 21st.

    Since Chiang Kai-shek issued the General Mobilization Order in early July, in order to intensify the exploitation of the Chinese people's blood and sweat to supply the huge consumption of his anti-people civil war, Chiang's Ministry of National Defense proposed an additional military expenditure budget of 13 trillion yuan in mid-July in one instance. According to estimates by several financial experts in the Chiang-controlled areas, Chiang's fiscal expenditure this year will reach 100 trillion Chiang coins. Chiang Kai-shek bandit relies mostly on printing banknotes to make up for such unprecedentedly huge military expenditures, which has caused prices to rise continuously. Since the end of July, the price of rice in Shanghai has risen from 380,000 yuan to 650,000 yuan in Chiang coins per shi (unit of dry measure), which is ten times higher than the 60,000 yuan per shi at the beginning of the year. The prices of other foreign and domestic goods have also skyrocketed. The people and lower-level public servants and teachers in the Chiang-controlled areas have fallen into the abyss of starvation, while the greedy Four Families and their lackeys have taken the opportunity to make fortunes, which objectively promotes the development of the collapsing economic crisis itself in the Chiang-controlled areas. According to reports from the Associated Press and Agence France-Presse in Nanjing on the 10th, Chiang Kai-shek revealed in a secret report to the Kuomintang Central Executive Committee that he complained about his lackeys, saying that at the end of the Anti-Japanese War, they possessed abundant foreign assets of 900 million US dollars, but the currency reform was delayed due to the "blind dependence" of the financial authorities on foreign loans. Chiang Kai-shek's remarks revealed part of the truth, that is, when the Chiang Party announced in February last year that all foreign exchange would be fixed at 2,020 yuan to one US dollar, it was said that the Chiang Party's Central Bank still had 500 million US dollars and more than 500,000 gold bars (see July 23, Ta Kung Pao). However, Chiang Kai-shek deliberately concealed the more important fact, that is, this reward from the foreign fathers at the cost of selling out national sovereignty was all stolen and enriched by the Four Families themselves. The Chen brothers, because of jealousy, exposed during Wei Demai's visit to China that between February and November last year, the three companies of Kong and Song families, Fuzhong, Yangzi Construction, and China Construction Bank, illegally stole 400 million US dollars in US exchange, not including other companies. This shows how the Four Families are obsessed with selling out the country for civil war, and making fortunes by exploiting the suffering of the Chinese people.
    Due to the deepening of Chiang Kai-shek's financial and economic crisis, the most anxious is US imperialism. On the one hand, it fears that the chaos and collapse of the Chiang Party's economy will hinder its plunder of the Chinese market, and on the other hand, it attempts to take the opportunity to tighten its control over the Chiang bandit's financial lifeline. The dispatch of financial and economic supervisor Young to China before and after Wei Demai's departure proves this. Since Wei Demai's visit to China, in order to show loyalty and further exploit the Chinese people to support its civil war consumption, Chiang Kai-shek has mobilized the big and small minions of the Chiang Party and promulgated many "laws" and "regulations" since the beginning of August. By September, it was even worse. Dong Xian Guang said to foreign reporters at a reception for foreign journalists: "Political and economic reforms will be the number one news in China in the coming months." Chiang Kai-shek also played a trick at the Fourth Plenary Session of the Chiang Party, saying that Song Ziwen had donated all his shares and assets in the Construction Bank (including the Huainan Coal Mine and Railway Company, Yangzi Power Company, and Hankou Power Company).
    Since August, all the Chiang Party's financial and economic measures have actually only illustrated three things: First, a more blatant and brutal attack on the people in the Chiang-controlled areas. The so-called economic reform plan in early August simply abandoned all the high-sounding official rhetoric of balancing the budget and tightening currency. Instead, it brought out the hat of developing agricultural production to talk about lively finance. This means: to turn the printing press even harder, to have a large currency expansion, and to squeeze out the last drop of blood from the people in the Chiang-controlled areas. The second thing is to deceive the people in the Chiang-controlled areas who are dissatisfied with the Four Families, including the so-called property tax, nation-building tax, and declaration of foreign deposits and assets, otherwise they will be sentenced to five years in prison or even worse. It is undoubtedly a daydream to expect the Four Families, who exploit the Chinese people to the bone, to declare their billions of dollars in overseas assets and voluntarily spit out their wealth. A United Press dispatch from Nanjing on the 15th succinctly revealed the secret of the so-called declaration of foreign assets: "When the government (referring to Chiang) put forward this plan, what it really wanted to obtain was political capital rather than financial capital." The third thing is to cater to the American masters, so that the American masters can more conveniently exploit the Chinese people and turn China into an American colony. After Wei Demai's visit to China, after American businessmen in Shanghai complained about the Chiang lackeys, Zhang Qun quickly issued a statement welcoming foreign investment and foreign technical talents. He shamelessly threw the set of "Three People's Principles" and economic plans that he used to talk about in the past into the latrine, and talked about inviting Americans to operate both light and heavy industries, and in order to facilitate the exploitation of American businessmen, he revised the foreign exchange regulations, almost admitting the black market exchange rate, and relaxed the import of goods, so that American businessmen could come full and return full. The so-called encouraging exports and absorbing overseas remittances are all a set of deceptive tricks. Still afraid that the American masters would not be at ease, they welcomed the supreme supervisor Young to directly control foreign exchange. The purpose of the various economic measures recently promoted by Chiang Kai-shek is here. However, the Chinese people will not only no longer be fooled and no longer endure exploitation, but also already know how to get rid of the exploitation of the American imperialists and the Four Families.

### 蒋匪的“财政金融措施”

    蒋匪的“财政金融措施”
    自七月初蒋匪颁布总动员令以后，蒋匪为了加紧压榨中国人民的血汗供其反人民内战巨大消耗，七月中旬一次即由蒋家国防部提出军费追加预算十三万亿元。若按蒋区若干财经专家估计，今年蒋匪财政岁出将达蒋币一百万亿元。蒋匪这样的空前巨大的军费支出，绝大部分依靠印刷钞票弥补，因而引起物价不断猛涨，七月底至今上海米价已由三十八万元涨至六十五万元蒋币一石，较之年初的六万元一石已涨了十倍；其它洋土各货莫不跟着暴涨，蒋区人民及下层公教人员陷于饥饿深渊，而贪婪双比的四大家族及其家奴们，则就趁机发财，在客观上又推动了蒋区整个日呈崩溃的经济危机自身的发展。据美联社与法新社十日南京电透露，蒋贼向国民党中执会的秘密报告中，曾透露对其家奴的抱怨，说对日战争结束时尚拥有九亿美元的丰富外国资产，却因财政当局对外国贷款的“盲目依赖”延搁了货币改革。蒋匪这段话，说出了部分事实，即是在去年二月蒋党宣布外汇都订为二○二○元比一元美金时，据说蒋党中央银行尚存有五万万元美金和五十余万条黄金（见七、廿三，大公报），但蒋贼却故意隐瞒了更重要的事实，那就是这笔以出卖国家主权为代价洋爸爸的赏赐，全给四大家族自己窃取自肥了。二陈家族因为争风吃醋的缘故，曾在魏德迈来华期间暴露过：在去年二月到十一月间，单孔、宋两家族的孚中、扬子建业以及中国建设银公司三个公司便非法盗取了美汇四亿元美金，别的尚不在内；由此可见四大家族是如何醉心于卖国内战，借中国人民苦难来发财自肥。
    由于蒋匪财政经济危机的日益深重，表现最着急的是美帝国主义，她一方面恐惧蒋党经济的混乱和崩溃防害她的中国市场掠夺，同时力图趁机达到加紧控制蒋匪财经命脉的目的。魏德离华前后，财政经济监督杨格奉派抵华，可以证明。自魏德迈来华以后，蒋匪为了表示效忠，并更进一步敲吸中国人民以支持其内战消耗，自八月初以来，动员了蒋党大小喽＠，颁布了不少“法令”“条例”，到了九月更甚，董显光曾在对外籍记者招待会上向外国记者说：“政治经济改革将为今后数月内中国头号新闻消息”。而蒋贼在蒋党四中全会上也出场玩了一手什么宋子文已将其在建设银公司（包括淮南煤矿与铁路公司，扬子电力公司，汉口电力公司）全部股票与资财捐出的花枪。
    从八月以来，所有蒋党的种种财经措施，实际上只是说明了三件事：第一是更露骨残暴地向蒋区人民进攻。八月初的所谓经济改革方案，索性对历来冠冕堂皇的平衡预算，紧缩通货之类官腔，一字不提了，干脆请出什么发展农业生产的帽子来大谈活泼金融。这就是说：要更加劲转动印刷机，来一个通货大膨胀，把蒋区人民最后一滴血都榨取过来。第二件事则是对不满四大家族的蒋区人民来一欺骗，包括所谓财产税建国税，申报外国存款资产，不然要处徒刑五年乃至蒋匪之宣布宋子文捐输等等。对中国人民敲骨吸髓的四大家族，要他们申报在海外十几亿美元的财产和自愿吐出财物，无疑的是痴人说梦。合众社十五日南京电，一语道破了所谓申报外国资产的这个秘密：“政府（指蒋）提出此方案时，其所真正欲求取者乃是政治的资本而非财政的资本”。第三件事是奉迎美国主子，让美国主人更方便来榨取中国人民，变中国为美国殖民地。魏德迈来华后，上海美商发了一顿对蒋奴才的牢骚之后，张群赶紧发表欢迎外资外国技术人材的谈话，不知羞耻把过去挂在嘴边的一套什么民生主义呀，经济方案，以“国防”为目的呀，一齐丢入粪坑，大谈不论轻重工业都请美国人来经营，并且为了方便美国商人的榨取，改订了外汇条例，几乎是承认了黑市汇价，又放宽了进口货品，让美国商人可以满载而来又可满载而归，所谓奖励出口，吸收侨汇等等，全是一套骗人把戏；这样还怕美国主子不放心，又迎来了太上监督杨格直接控制了外汇，蒋匪最近所宣传的种种经济措施，目的就在这里，但是中国人民，不仅不会再受愚弄，不再忍受剥削，而且已经知道如何来解脱美帝国主义者四大家族的盘剥。（新华社九月二十一日电）
