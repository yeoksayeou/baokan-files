Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 9th: North of the Daqing River, our Rongding (area between Rongcheng and Ding County) county and district cadres are distributed throughout the county, and combined with the militia to organize numerous joint working teams to persist behind enemy lines. They have been fighting bravely for a month against the Chiang Kai-shek puppet Wang Fenggang and other troops who have been harassing the county. The working teams have used village explosions and mobile guerrilla warfare to protect villages and frustrate the Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops' plans to seize grain and conscript soldiers, making it so that landlords and special agents do not dare to engage in large-scale activities. Last month, the puppet Wang Fenggang's troops were attacked by working teams when they were looting and conscripting soldiers in Xiniu, Zhangshi and other villages. The grain that had already been loaded onto vehicles in Xiniu was also seized back by the working team, and eight puppet soldiers were killed or wounded. Nanzhuang, Xiaoli and other villages fought seven battles in one day, killing or wounding seven enemy company commanders and below. Landmines were laid everywhere in Wanglu Village, and the enemy puppets never dared to enter the village. The working teams also carried out political offensives against the enemy during combat, altering puppet slogans everywhere and conducting loudspeaker propaganda. Furthermore: The Anci working team, active on the Beining Railway, has repeatedly won victories in suppressing bandits and special agents. Armed bandits and special agents in groups of three or five are ambushed from time to time. In the past month, they have captured nine people, including the notorious special agent bandit Wang Wenming, destroyed three bandit and special agent strongholds, and destroyed the enemy special agent organization, the "Demobilized Military Intelligence Station." They have successively captured Sun Guangrui, a tax package head, and many landlord special agents from Anci and Luofa. Bandits and special agents in the area no longer dare to engage in large-scale activities, and some bandits have even begun to express remorse to the working team.
