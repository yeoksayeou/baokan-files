【This newspaper, Taiyue, 12th report】In the newly liberated areas of An邑 Second District in Southern Shanxi, under the slogan of "Overturning and digging up the roots of poverty, establishing the roots of wealth through production," wasteland elimination and fertilizer production are being carried out simultaneously. Enthusiasm is unprecedented, and the wasteland created during the enemy and puppet rule is being completely eliminated. According to statistics, the district has eliminated a total of 21 hectares and 79 acres of wasteland. The methods of eliminating wasteland are as follows: (1) Plough first, then divide: Organize all villagers to open up wasteland first, then divide the land; (2) Open up land separately: For example, Lu Village, Piao Village, and Ji Village jointly had more than 80 acres of wasteland on Yuwang Mountain, which was divided among the villages; (3) Exchange interspersed land (i.e., wasteland interspersed in other people's land) to eliminate wasteland nearby; (4) Help eliminate wasteland: For example, after Qu Village eliminated its own wasteland, it organized 30 head of livestock to help Gangtou Village; (5) Mutual aid groups report the elimination of wasteland and are rewarded according to work points; (6) Cooperatives and militia eliminate wasteland: For example, militiamen in each village have opened up wasteland to solve the costs of expeditions and ammunition. Following the vigorous elimination of wasteland, fertilizer is produced, achieving "fertilizer accumulation in every village, fertilizer accumulation by everyone." Children in Donghe cut five large carts of artemisia in one afternoon. The wild artemisia along the grassy slopes and roadsides of each village has been composted into manure. In more than 20 days, a total of 61,228 large carts of fertilizer have been produced. In this movement, many labor models have emerged. Jin Village was selected as the first-class labor model village, with an average of 80 dan of manure applied per mu. Xu Village, Cui Shao, and Shuidong were second-class model villages, with an average of 50 dan of manure applied per mu. The individual model for the entire district is Wang Yihe of Yuan Village, who applied 130 dan of manure per mu. The second-class individual model is Zhang Xiaowen of Yan Village, who applied 80 dan of manure per mu. This year, wheat fields in each village have generally achieved 30 dan of manure applied per mu.

【This newspaper, Taiyue, 12th report】The basic-level organization of Yuan Village in Tunliu, the "Practical Inspection Group", promotes production. On August 20, ten administrative villages, including Lu Village, Wang Village, and Ji Village, which formed the Yuan Village base point, organized a "Practical Inspection Group" with one representative from each village, divided into groups of three villages, and went up the mountains and down to the fields on the 28th of last month to inspect the actual situation of each village's elimination of wasteland, weeding seedlings, ploughing wheat fields, accumulating fertilizer, and mutual aid groups. It was stipulated that reports, commendations, and good deeds would be recorded at the weekly base point meeting, thus solving the problem of few cadres, many villages, and difficult leadership and promotion.

　　安邑新区农民积极造肥灭荒
    【本报太岳十二日电】晋南新解放区安邑二区，在“翻身挖穷根，生产扎富根”的口号下，同时进行灭荒造肥，情绪空前高涨，把敌伪统治时造成的荒地消灭干净。据统计，该区共消灭荒地二十一顷七十九亩。灭荒办法如下：（一）先犁后分：把全村人组织起来，先开荒后分地；（二）分别开地：如路村、票村、姬村伙有一个禹王山八十多亩荒，各村分开；（三）交换插花地（即插在人家地里的荒地，）作到就近灭荒；（四）帮助灭荒：如曲庄把本村的荒地灭完，又组织了三十头牲口到岗头村帮助；（五）互助组自报灭荒，按工分红；（六）合作社民兵灭荒：如各村民兵都开有荒地，解决远征与弹药等费用。大力灭荒继即造肥，做到“村村积肥、人人积肥”，东河儿童一下午就割蒿五大车，各村草坡路边的荒蒿都沤成了粪，二十多天工夫，共造肥六万一千二百二十八大车。在这一运动中，涌现出不少劳动模范。选出了一等劳动模范村金庄，该村每亩地平均上粪八十担。二等模范村许村、崔邵、水洞，每亩地平均上粪五十担。全区个人模范有原村的王义和，他每亩地上粪一百三十担。二等个人模范是淹村的张小文，他每亩地上粪八十担，今年各村麦地，普遍做到每亩上粪三十担。
    【本报太岳十二日电】屯留原村基点组织“实际检查团”，推动生产。八月二十日原村基点路村、王村、姬村等十个行政村，由一村一个代表组织起“实际检查团”，三村一个小组，已于上月二十八日分头上山下地，检查各村消灭荒地、锄苗、犁麦地、积肥、互助组等实际情形，并规定在一星期一次的基点会议上汇报、表功记功记好，这样解决了干部少、村子多、领导推动困难的问题。
