(Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 17th) A combined report from Yogyakarta and Batavia, dated 13th to 16th: As Dutch troops continued their advance on Indonesian army positions in Java, Sumatra, and Madura, they encountered fierce resistance from the Indonesian army. In the mountainous regions of Sumatra, Dutch "mopping-up" forces were ambushed by the Indonesian army, suffering heavy casualties. The Indonesian army has established a strong stronghold in Brastagi and is advancing towards the Bukit Asam (southern Sumatra) coal mining area. Despite the Dutch army's strong attacks, the Indonesian army continues to firmly hold the vast area between Semarang and Cirebon in Java. Indonesian guerrilla forces are very active in Dutch-occupied areas. Recently, Dutch power plants and many other factories in Java and Sumatra have been destroyed. Indonesian Republic Foreign Minister Salim stated: "Within a certain period, the Dutch military offensive will become exhausted, because as the war continues, they will not be able to produce any trees, quinine, or tin." Salim firmly believes that "The Indonesian capital, Yogyakarta, is Stalingrad, and the Dutch army will not be able to break through."

    【新华社陕北十七日电】综合日惹与巴城十三至十六日讯：荷军在爪哇、苏门答腊及马都拉继续进犯印尼军阵地时，遭到印尼军之猛烈抵抗。在苏门答腊山地，荷军之“扫荡”部队被印尼军阻击，伤亡颇重。印尼军于布拉斯达哥建立坚强据点，并向比奇达森（苏岛南部）煤矿区挺进中。在荷军强攻下，印尼军至今仍固守爪哇的三宝垄与井里汶间之广大地区。印尼游击部队在荷占领区甚为活动，最近爪哇和苏门答腊的荷兰电力厂及许多其他工厂均被毁坏。印尼共和国外长沙立姆谈称：“在一定时期内，荷兰之军事进攻将要疲倦下来。因为战争之继续进行，他们不能生产任何的树、奎宁和锡。”沙氏坚信“印尼首老日惹是斯大林格勒，荷军是攻不进去的。”
