　　【This Newspaper's Report】Based on the demands of the masses, the Bo'ai Democratic Government issued a notice calling on all villages to open schools. The masses have been actively hiring teachers and establishing their own schools for liberated children. According to incomplete statistics as of August 11th, eight complete primary schools and one hundred elementary schools have already opened, with 11,960 children enrolled and 250 teachers hired. All schools have universally established broadcasting stations and public blackboards. The broadcasting station of the Xima Village Primary School played a significant role in promoting the rush planting efforts. In particular, during the recent "one pot cooking" movement, teachers and students genuinely participated in the struggle against evil landlords. Children everywhere joyfully sang songs of liberation, greatly inspiring the morale of the masses. The masses happily said: "It really feels like it's our world now!" During the liberation of Wu'zhi and Xiuwu counties, primary school students greeted the wounded soldiers at the hospitals with great enthusiasm. The Seventh District Complete Primary School was also awarded a banner of commendation.

　　博爱新区小学开课农民子弟纷纷入学
    【本报讯】博爱民主政府根据群众要求发出通知，号召各村开学，群众纷纷自动聘请教员，建立自己的翻身子弟学校。据八月十一号的不完全统计，已有完校八处、初校一百处开学，入学儿童达一万一千九百六十人，聘请教员二百五十人，所有学校普遍建立了广播台与大众黑板。西马营村小学的广播台，在突击抢种中起了不少推动作用。特别是在这次一锅煮运动中，教员学生都真正的参加了反恶霸地主的斗争，儿童到处欢唱翻身歌曲，对群众情绪的鼓舞很大。群众高兴地说：真成咱们天下了。解放武陟、修武等县时，小学生到医院招呼彩号，热情很高。七区完小并荣获绵旗一面。
