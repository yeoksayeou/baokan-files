    Statement from the Xingtai Procurement Office, Seventh Factory, Military Industry Department

    This office has been ordered to reduce its organization and has decided to close the Handan and Zuoquan County Tongyu Town procurement stations. All official seals and stamps of the Handan and Tongyu procurement stations are void from today.

    Drug trafficker and corrupt element Wang Zichun (from Shilidian Village, Wu'an) has been expelled and is now handed over to the government for investigation and prosecution. Those holding receipts should come to clear them up in September. We will not be responsible for any claims after the deadline. This is hereby announced.
