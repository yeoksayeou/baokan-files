    Various Places Break with Old Conventions
    Organizing the Masses to Seize the Time to Sow Wheat
    [Our newspaper, Lucheng News] After the cadres of Zhongcun in the Third District returned to the village from the district meeting, they immediately convened a meeting of all village cadres and masses to discuss the current work. They called for seizing the time to sow wheat, breaking the old-fashioned, leisurely, and conservative thinking of the masses of "sowing in the eighth month after the White Dew in the seventh month" [lunar calendar]. The aim was to universally complete sowing before the fifth day of the eighth lunar month.
    After the meeting, on the afternoon of the 26th day of the seventh lunar month, political director Jiang Jincai shouldered a seed drill to the field to sow wheat. When he passed through the street, some people said, "Jincai! Isn't it too early?" He said, "Seizing the time is important." That afternoon, he sowed four mu of 169 wheat. The next day, the masses also followed suit and started sowing, planting 40 mu in one day. By the afternoon of the 30th, statistics showed that the entire village had completed sowing 210 mu. A total of 160 mu of 169 wheat were expanded, and land ploughed three times accounted for two-thirds of the area. In order to complete the task of concentrated sowing earlier, they held another meeting on the night of the 30th to study the issue. The result was that some groups could complete sowing in two days, while others needed three, four, or five days. Finally, everyone decided that the seven mutual aid groups would carry out large-scale transfers. Women would be responsible for tasks such as grinding flour at home and picking hemp in the fields. Male laborers and livestock were fully organized to concentrate on sowing, so that all sowing could be completed in another four days. (Wen Fu)
    [Our newspaper, Licheng News] On the 7th of this month, Xia Village convened a symposium of group leaders, heroes, and activists to study and seize the time to launch the wheat sowing campaign. Labor Hero Wang Jinming said: "Last year, due to heavy rains during the White Dew solar term, sowing was delayed, which affected the yield of 169 wheat this year. We must work earlier this year." Wang Fengqi said: "There are many things to do this year, the autumn crops are also ripening soon, plus we have to plant more improved wheat varieties (expand wheat fields), and if we encounter continuous rainy days, it will be difficult to manage. We must not slack off, we must strive to be tight first and then loose, not loose first and then tight." After the meeting, they went to various mutual aid groups to further mobilize and promote the effort in a comprehensive way. Labor Hero Wang Jinming returned to his group and proposed that this year's wheat sowing should be done early and late to catch up with the work. Wang Jinming's three and a half mu of land behind the village used to take a day and a half to cultivate. This year, he started early and completed ploughing and sowing in one day. It is estimated that one animal can sow at least half a mu more land per day. This practical action influenced and promoted the masses. Wang Baoquan drove his cattle to the fields every day as soon as it was dawn, and only returned when it was dark and he could not do any more work. Old men like Wang Changde went to the fields before the sun rose in the morning. In this way, the efficiency of cultivation in the whole village was greatly improved. The whole village had 35 head of livestock, 93 full laborers, and 37 auxiliary laborers. In the past, they could only cultivate about 92 mu per day. By starting early and working late, they planted 110 mu of 169 wheat on the 11th. The original plan was to complete the sowing of wheat in the whole village (1,100 mu of normal rotation) in twelve days, but now they will complete all the sowing in ten days, which can save 223 laborers and 140 animal labors.
    On the night of the 14th, another meeting of group leaders, heroes, and cadres was held to check and summarize the wheat sowing work of the previous four days. Statistics showed that 638.7 mu had been sown, accounting for 60% of the total number of normal rotation wheat fields in the village. It is planned that all sowing can be completed in another four days, but on the other hand, some individual households are eager to catch up with sowing and neglect deep ploughing and careful cultivation. Some have sown after only ploughing the surface once. After heated discussions, everyone unanimously proposed that the remaining unsown land must be guaranteed to be ploughed three times, not only quickly, but also well.

    [Our newspaper, Wuxiang News] In the production increase and frugality campaign in the first half of the year, the masses in the Third District all recognized the severity of this year's disaster and launched active production increase, breaking the old habits of the past: that barren land cannot be sown with wheat, and that late stubble will not grow well. In order to ensure a greater wheat yield next year, the masses in various villages launched a large-scale fertilizer production campaign. According to statistics from 26 villages, the original wheat land last year was 33,104.8 mu, and this year, 37,979.8 mu will be sown, which is 4,875 mu more than last year. The original fertilizer was 11,152,800 dan, and now 10,491,200 dan of fertilizer has been produced, with an average of more than 50 dan of fertilizer applied per mu. It is planned that next year's wheat production can be increased by 1,950 shi. Within two days of the 8th of this month, Yao Bingyin's group in Yao Village has sown 30 mu of wheat, which promoted the entire joint defense. Wheat sowing and autumn harvesting are carried out simultaneously, striving to complete wheat sowing before the autumn harvest. (Jing Gang)

    各地纷纷打破旧例
    组织群众抢天种麦
    【本报潞城讯】三区中村干部由区开会回村后，即召集全村干部群众讨论目前工作，号召抢天种麦，打破群众“七月白露八月种”的老一套等待消闲守旧思想。要在阴历八月初五日以前普遍种完。
    开会后，阴历七月二十六日下午，政治主任蒋进才就扛上耧去地种麦，他由街上过时，群众有的说：“进才！太早吧！”他说：“抢天要紧。”当天下午他就种了一六九小麦四亩，到第二天群众也都跟着种开了，一天种了四十亩，到三十日下午统计全村已完成下种二百一十亩。计扩大一六九小麦，共一百六十亩，犁三遍工的地占三分之二数。他们为了更提前完成突击下种任务，又在三十日夜开会研究，结果有的组能在二天种完，有的组得三天四天或五天不等。最后大家决定七个互助组进行大拨大调，家里推碾地里摘大麻等全由妇女担任。男劳力和牲口完全组织突击下种，这样再有四天就能全部种完。（文辅）
    【本报黎城讯】霞庄村于本月七日，召开各组长英雄积极分子会研究抓紧时间开展种麦运动座谈会。劳英王金明说：“去年由于交节（白露）下雨多，耽搁种迟啦，影响到今年一六九少打很多，今年可得早干哩。”王逢奇说：“今年事情多，秋庄稼也快熟啦，加上咱还要多种改麦（扩大麦田），再要遇个连雨天，就不好办啦，千万不敢松，能叫先紧后松，不叫先松后紧。”会后就分头深入到各个互助小组作进一步的全面动员与推动，劳英王金明回到组里，提出咱今年种麦为赶工，要起早搭黑干，王金明寨后三亩半地，过去总是一天半，才能耕种里，今年起了个早，连犁带种一天就完成了。计算起来一犋牲口，一天至少多种半亩地。这种实际行动影响推动了各个群众，王保全每日天刚亮就赶着牛上了地，下午天黑看不见做生活才往回走，王长德等老汉早晨太阳不上来，就去了地。这样全村耕作效率大大提高，全村牲口三十五犋，全劳力九十三个，辅助劳力三十七个，过去一般每天只能耕种九十二亩左右，加上起早搭黑，在十一日一天内就种了一百一十亩一六九。原计划十二天完成全村小麦下种（正茬一千一百亩），现在要在十天内完成全部下种，计能节省劳力二百二十三个，畜力一百四十个。
    十四日夜，又召开各组长英雄干部会议，检查总结前四天的种麦工作，统计已种六百三十八亩七分，占全村正茬麦田总数百分之六十，计划再有四天，即可全部下种，但另方面却有个别户急于赶种，忽视了深耕细作，有的只耕过头犁就种上了，大家经过热烈讨论，一致提出剩余没下种地，一定要保证耕够三犁，不但要快，还要好。（次孟、经文、麦生、富禄、本成、士廉、爱生）
    【本报武乡讯】三区群众在前半年的增产节约运动中，都认识了今年灾情的严重，开展积极增产，打破了过去旧习惯：生荒不能种麦，秋后赶茬长不好等说法，为了保证明年多产麦，各村群众展开大量造肥运动。现据二十六个村的统计，去年原有麦地三三一零四·八亩，今年就要种麦三七九七九·八亩，比去年多种麦地四八七五亩，原有肥料一一一五二八○担，现造肥一零四九一二○担，每亩平均上肥五十余担，计划明年能增产麦子一九五○石。在本月八号两天内，姚庄村有姚丙寅组已种了麦子三十亩，推动了全联防，种麦秋收两不误，争取在秋收前把麦子种完。（景岗）
