　　Mobilizing the Masses to Expose Untrue News
  　Jin Sui Daily Conducts Deep Self-Criticism
    Positive Public Response; Newspaper's Credibility Unprecedentedly Enhanced
    [Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 28th] The Jin Sui journalism circles are conducting deep self-criticism, mobilizing the masses to expose untrue news, and reporting "armchair strategists." Since last autumn, Jin Sui Daily has successively published critical news reports, which have greatly promoted various tasks. The newspaper's credibility has been unprecedentedly enhanced. Readers often use the news in the newspaper to verify actual work. As a result, many reports were found to be untrue. After receiving letters from readers, the newspaper and the Xinhua General Branch initially selected key points to publish in the news business publication "News Research" and the newspaper. Later, the number of readers' letters increased, and the revealed issues also increased and became extremely serious. Therefore, the decision was made to thoroughly rectify the news lineup. From late June, Jin Sui Daily successively published a long article entitled "Exposing Untrue News and Armchair Strategists," calling on everyone to report "armchair strategists" and instructing the reporters, correspondents, and editors to make responsible reflections and statements to the people, and to repent and apologize. After repeated discussions, it was further discovered that the root causes of untrue news were extensive. For example, there was a lack of policy and ideological education and training for news cadres; a lack of a pragmatic work style; failure to follow the mass line in interviews; inability to break out of the cadre circle; failure to seek corroboration when writing news; and even the use of literary writing methods to write news reports. However, the main reason was that many news cadres had unstable positions and unclear thinking during the land reform. Some news was deliberately fabricated, while others were "honest" rumors. Therefore, overcoming untrue news is not only the responsibility of newspapers and news agencies, but also the responsibility of other work departments. It is necessary for all units to universally report in order to thoroughly eliminate it. After strict self-reflection by news workers, the vast number of readers in various places responded positively, believing that this was the correct path to thoroughly improve news work and the work style that people's news workers should have. Many readers automatically came to help check. The district cadres of Hequ County personally went to the village with the most inaccurate reports, asked the masses to put forward criticisms and opinions, and decided that in the future, all manuscripts about mass activities must be reviewed by the masses. A village cadre in Kelan County relaxed his leadership in disaster relief due to illness, but the newspaper criticized him for being "selfish." After reading the newspaper, he said, "Everything else is true, but this point is really wrong." When the newspaper received his letter requesting a correction, it asked the correspondent who wrote the article to publicly apologize to the village chief. Inspired by the power of the masses, some news workers who have not yet been reported are already conducting self-reflection, but there are also a few people who believe that this approach is attacking individuals, so they are showing low morale and even unwilling to write. Now the journalism circles are implementing a firm policy, strengthening internal education on serving the people, and letting go of mobilizing the masses to continue reporting "armchair strategists."

　　发动群众揭露不真实新闻
  　晋绥日报深入自我检讨
    群众反应良好报纸威信空前提高
    【新华社晋绥二十八日电】晋绥新闻界深入自我批评，发动群众揭露不真实的新闻，检举“客里空”。晋绥日报从去秋以来，陆续发表批评性的消息，对各项工作起了很大的推动作用，报纸的威信空前提高，读者经常拿报纸的新闻对证实际工作，结果发现很多报导失实。报社和新华总分社接到读者来信后，开始时择要在新闻业务刊物“新闻研究”和报纸上发表，后来读者的信件愈来愈多，揭发的事情也随着增多，而且极严重，因此决心彻底整顿新闻阵容。从六月下旬起，晋绥日报连续刊载“不真实新闻与客里空之揭露”长文，号召大家来检举“客里空”，并责成写稿的记者、通讯员和编辑人员，向人民作负责的反省和声明，进行悔过和道歉。经过反复的讨论，又进一步发现产生不真实新闻的根源，牵涉范围很广。如对新闻干部缺乏政策思想以及政治修养的教育和培养；缺乏实事求是的工作作风，采访不走群众路线，跳不出干部圈子，写新闻不求旁证，甚至把文艺写作方法搬来写新闻通讯，但主要是土地改革中不少新闻干部立场不稳，思想未澄清，有的新闻是故意捏造的，但也有是“老老实实”的谣言。因此，克服不真实新闻不仅是报纸和通讯社的责任，同时也是其他各工作部门的责任，必须各单位普遍起来检举，才能彻底肃清。经新闻工作者严格自己反省后，各地广大读者都反应良好，认为这是彻底改进新闻工作的正确道路，是人民新闻工作者应有的作风。许多读者自动来帮助检查，河曲县的区干部亲自到报导失实最多的村庄，请群众提出批评和意见，并决定以后凡是写群众活动的稿件，一定要经过群众审查。岢岚县某村干部因病放松领导救荒，但报上批评他“自私”，他看报后说：“别的都是事实，只是这一点实在冤枉。”报社接到他要求更正的来信时，就叫写稿的通讯员向该村长公开道歉。在群众力量感召下，目前还没有被检举的部分新闻工作者，已经自动进行反省，但也有少数人员，认为这样作法是打击个人，因此表现情绪低落，甚至不愿写稿。现在新闻界正贯彻坚定的方针，加强内部为人民服务的教育，放手发动群众，继续检举“客里空”。
