Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, September 24th: The Jin-Sui People's Guerrilla Force has advanced into enemy territory from west to east, and the flames of guerrilla warfare have spread throughout the Fu bandit-occupied areas in eastern Suiyuan. The iron cavalry of the guerrilla force galloping across the triangle of Helin, Tuoxian, and Qingshuihe killed, wounded, and captured over 370 enemy soldiers in twelve battles last month, while the guerrilla force only suffered over 30 casualties. The guerrilla force active near Datong launched four surprise attacks on enemy strongholds in the suburbs of the city last month, killing and capturing over 100 enemy soldiers, destroying one vehicle, and seizing 40 boxes of gasoline, 3 machine guns, and over 40 rifles. In the battle at Caijiazhuang, ten miles southeast of the city on the 22nd, the entire security squadron of 42 enemy soldiers were wiped out in just five minutes. The guerrilla force that penetrated Xinghe, Jining, and Fengshou achieved successive victories in Yingzi, southeast of Xinghe, and Longshengzhuang, northeast of Fengzhen, from the 26th to the 30th of last month, wiping out over 60 enemy soldiers and seizing 45 long and short guns and 41 warhorses.

Xinhua News Agency, Ji-Cha-Re-Liao, September 17th: The People's Guerrilla Force in the border areas of eastern Chahar has launched an offensive deep into the rear of the Chiang-Fu bandits to protect the autumn harvest. The Chi-Nan (newly established county south of Chicheng) guerrilla militia has been fighting continuously from the 16th of last month to the 5th of this month, killing, wounding, and capturing 42 Fu bandit security captains and below, repelling over 40 Fu bandit police attempting to loot grain at Xingren Fort, and recovering 30 livestock. The third district working team of the county went deep into the enemy's rear, active between Xingren Fort and Xiao Yi, held mass rallies, publicized the land reform in the liberated areas, distributed propaganda to the Fu bandit strongholds, and conducted loudspeaker appeals, launching a political offensive. The people and soldiers who had long suffered from the exploitation of Fu Zuoyi's bandits joined the guerrilla force one after another to resist the Chiang-Fu bandit gang. Eighty armed village governments have emerged in the "no-man's land" previously created by the Fu area, bravely persisting in the struggle behind enemy lines. The flying demolition team of the third district of Huailai blocked the Fu bandits 14 times, and in the battle of Taotouying, they repelled over 100 Fu bandit returning corps, smashing the Fu bandit's conspiracy to create a "no-man's land." The Longguan militia killed and captured 55 bandits, special agents, and tyrannical landlords last month. In the guerrilla operations in various places, the local farmers all automatically cooperated with the troops by leading the way and providing information. In addition, the local armed forces of Linyu County in eastern Hebei, in conjunction with the broad masses, took the initiative to attack and surround the strongholds of the Chiang bandits, protecting the review. The bandit army was extremely panicked, and guarded day and night, and dared not go out of the stronghold for several days. Chiang bandits in Shimensai, Shangzhuangfang and other places were defeated by the militia. At present, the broad masses of the county are continuing to conduct grievance telling and liquidation amidst the sound of artillery fire.
