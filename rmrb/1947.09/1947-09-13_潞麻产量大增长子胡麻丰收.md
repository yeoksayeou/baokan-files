　　[Report from our Changzhi Bureau] Changzhi's famous specialty, Lucerne hemp, has reached the harvesting season, and about seven-tenths has already been harvested. Lucerne hemp, generally speaking in China, can be compared with the hemp produced in Lu'an in Anhui, Zhangjiakou, Yuxian, and Huangpuji in Kaifeng. Before the war, large quantities were sold to Tianjin, the Northeast, and other places via the Pinghan Railway, because its quality is good and can be used to make silk fabrics. Before the war, the county's annual output was about two million catties. After the enemy occupied Changzhi, due to the enemy's heavy taxes and levies, it could not be bought and sold casually and was all sold to the enemy's hemp skin groups. The amount planted was greatly reduced. This year, under the call of our government to grow more special crops and increase production to achieve "cultivate three, surplus one," 96 villages along both sides of the Changzhi-Yincheng highway, the main Lucerne hemp production area in the county, and along the Zhanghe and Taoqing Rivers planted a total of 25,000 mu of Lucerne hemp. Each mu can produce 80 catties, for a total of 2 million catties, reaching the pre-war level.

The peasants were extremely excited to harvest Lucerne hemp on their own land for the first time. Wang Shuangzhu said: "In the past, we were harvesting hemp for the landlords. Poor people had no hemp. In Beicheng Village, the landlords owned 375 mu of the village's 485 mu of gardens. Li Guangzhong's family in Nancheng planted more than 100 mu of hemp, and Wang Xizeng's family in Beicheng planted 30 mu. Now it has all been taken back. In the past, half of the 301 households in Beicheng had no garden land, but now each household has 1.5 mu of garden land." Mao Sheng said: "In the past, the landlords were happy when harvesting hemp, but we were not. We had to pay off the landlords' debts, going to the fields to kill hemp when harvesting. Gen Yun borrowed money from Wang Xizeng, and when harvesting hemp, people took two mu of hemp away." Hao Jing said: "In the past, landlords also had hemp shops. If you spent their money in advance, you couldn't wait for a good price when harvesting hemp, you had to give it to them, and they would sell it at a good price when the price went up."

Cheng Jinze and others from Shangcun organized the transport of hemp to Quwo to exchange for cotton, one catty can be exchanged for one catty. More than two hundred catties have already been exchanged, finding a very good sales channel. Currently, cooperatives in various villages are organizing the masses to transport hemp to other districts to exchange for salt, cotton, and other necessities for the masses.

　　[Report from our Taiyue Bureau, 11th] Changzi has a bumper harvest of flax. This spring, in order to increase production, all villages were called upon to plant flax in large quantities to prepare for replanting wheat in the autumn. With the efforts of the village cadres, the county planted a total of 76,400 mu of flax. Now the county has a bumper harvest of flax, with an average yield of about 4.5 dou per mu, for a total yield of more than 34,380 shi of flax. The county has more than 41,600 households, with an average yield of more than 8 dou of flax per household. Each dou of flax can be exchanged for 2.12 catties of seeds, which can be exchanged for more than 22 catties of oil, which can solve most of the oil and lighting needs of each household. Before the flax was harvested, one catty of oil cost 800 yuan, but now it has fallen to 320 yuan. The people are happily saying: "Since the Communist Party came, it has been bright day and night." Currently, various villages are rushing to transport fertilizer to the flax fields to prepare for planting wheat. Including the original wheat fields, there are nearly 200,000 mu, and it is estimated that next year's wheat production can increase by more than 60,000 shi compared to this year.

　　潞麻产量大增长子胡麻丰收
    【本报长治讯】长治出名的特产——潞麻，已到收割季节，目前已收割十分之七。潞麻在全国说来，可以和安徽六安、张家口、蔚县、开封黄浦集所出的麻媲美，战前大批经平汉路出售到天津、东北等地，因为质量根好，可做绸缎。战前全县产量每年约二百万斤，敌人占长治后，因敌捐税苛重，不能随便卖买，都出售给敌人的麻皮组，种植数量，大大减少。今年在我们政府多种特种作物，增加产量，达到耕三余一的号召下，全县主要产麻地带长（治）荫（城）公路两侧，及漳河、淘清河两岸九十六个村共种麻二万五千亩，每亩可产八十斤，共产二百万斤，已达战前水平。
    农民第一次在自己的土地上收麻，兴奋万分。王双柱说：“过去咱是给老财杀麻，穷人无麻，北呈全村四百八十五亩园地，光老财就有三百七十五亩，南呈李光中一家就种麻一百多亩，北呈王锡增一家就种三十亩。现在都夺回来了。以前北呈三百零一户，有一半没园地，现在每户都有一亩半园地。”茂盛说：“过去杀麻是地主高兴，咱不高兴，该下老财的帐，杀麻时到地里要。根云借王锡增钱，收麻时人家把二亩麻收走了。”好景说：“以前地主还有麻行，早支上人家钱花了，收下麻就不能等个好价，就得给了人家，涨了价人家卖好价钱。”
    上村程金则等组织担麻到曲沃换棉花，一斤可换到一斤，已换回二百多斤，找到了很好的销路。现各村合作社正组织群众担麻到外区换盐、换棉花、换群众的必须品。（宪德、杏珍、高熙）
    【本报太岳十一日电】长子葫麻丰收。今春为了增产，曾号召各村大量植葫麻，以备秋季改种小麦。在各村干部努力推动下，全县共种葫麻七万六千四百余亩。现全县葫麻已丰收，每亩平均产量约四斗五石，共可产葫麻三万四千三百八十余石，全县四万一千六百余户，每户平均产葫麻八斗多，每斗葫麻能换子二斤十二两，即可换油二十二斤多，可解决每户大部吃油和点灯之用。在葫麻未收前，一斤油买八百元，现已跌至三百二十元，老百姓都高兴的说：“自从来了共产党，白天黑夜明晃晃。”目前各村正赶紧往葫麻地里运粪，准备种小麦，连原有麦地已近二十万亩，预计明年小麦较今年能增产六万多石。
