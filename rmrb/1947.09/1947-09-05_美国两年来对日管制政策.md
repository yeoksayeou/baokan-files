　　U.S. Policy of Control Over Japan in the Past Two Years
    Zhang Shangming
    Two years ago, on September 4th, Shigemitsu Mamoru, representing the Japanese Emperor, signed the instrument of surrender on the American battleship Missouri. This day also marked MacArthur's official entry into Japan.
    MacArthur's entry into Japan was a decision of the Potsdam Conference. MacArthur went to Japan to accept the surrender as "Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers," not as "American Commander." However, in the two years since MacArthur's entry into Japan, he has clearly abandoned the provisions of the Potsdam Agreement regarding the realization of political and economic democratization in Japan and the eradication of Japanese militarist forces, and has completely disregarded the proper authority of the Allied joint control institutions for Japan—the Far Eastern Commission and the Allied Council for Japan.
    All of MacArthur's measures toward Japan, and the goals he sought to achieve, were based on the "United States Initial Post-Surrender Policy for Japan" announced on September 6, 1945. The main point of this policy is specified in Article 2: "To ensure that Japan will not again become a menace to the United States or to the peace and security of the Far East and the world. To bring about the establishment in Japan of a peacefully inclined and responsible government which will respect the rights of other states and will support the objectives of the United States as reflected in the ideals and principles of the Charter of the United Nations." In other words, post-war Japan must be a country that "supports" America's expansionist policy, anti-Soviet, anti-communist, anti-democratic policy, and policy of subjugating China.
    Therefore, in politics, the U.S. policy is to support the Emperor system's fascist structure and suppress the democratic movement of the Japanese people. Currently, the Japanese imperial family has been restored by MacArthur to its old status as a reactionary fortress of warlords, zaibatsu, and feudal landlords. MacArthur not only exonerated the Emperor from war crimes but also allowed him to retain 630,000 cho (one cho equals 15 Chinese mu) of land and 3.7 billion yuan in assets. The new Japanese constitution approved by MacArthur guarantees the Emperor's control of military and political power. Around the Emperor system, the U.S. has also recruited and colluded with all anti-Soviet and anti-democratic forces in the government and opposition parties, such as Ashida, Nishio, Hirano, who are in power in the current government, and Matsuoka, the speaker of the House of Representatives. These militarist elements were originally on MacArthur's list for "purging." The punishment of twenty major Japanese war criminals has been delayed until now. Anti-Soviet ringleader Kanji Ishihara and chief culprit of the invasion of China, Yasuji Okamura, and thousands of other military fascist elements are still at large. Not only that, but the U.S. is actively fostering Japan's military potential. Many military industrial facilities that were supposed to be used as reparations have been retained, and a disguised general staff headquarters actually exists under the name of the "Repatriation Bureau." In mid-August, the American "Pan American" and "North American" airlines established bases in Japan to expand Japan's "aviation industry." U.S. imperialism is also personally training thousands of Japanese pilots.
    MacArthur bloodily suppresses the democratic movement of the Japanese people. In early February of this year, when two million Japanese workers launched a general strike to overthrow the cabinet, MacArthur personally issued a ban and dispatched tanks to assist the Japanese military police in suppressing it. The Japanese government recently formulated the so-called "Political Parties Bill," intending to further exclude the democratic forces led by the Japanese Communist Party. The Chief Cabinet Secretary also reiterated the reactionary ban on "political general strikes." As for the Japanese government's discriminatory treatment and arbitrary massacre of our Chinese compatriots residing in Japan, MacArthur has consistently adopted an attitude of condoning it.
    Economically, the U.S. policy is to support the zaibatsu and, through collusion with the zaibatsu, monopolize Japan's entire economic lifeline. MacArthur's directive to "dissolve the zaibatsu monopoly system" has not been truly implemented. The Mitsui Company still makes a profit of 350 million yen per month at official prices. In fact, the U.S. is sparing no effort to support the Japanese zaibatsu. Following the 1.114 billion yuan loan for the coal industry in July, on August 14, MacArthur approved another 137 million yen in gold reserves for Japan in exchange for a $500 million loan. The U.S. Export-Import Bank also plans to conclude an agreement with the Japanese government for a new loan for American cotton. At the same time, Japan's light and heavy industries are developing rapidly due to the U.S.'s ample supply of raw materials and equipment. For example, the current production volume of Japan's steel industry has reached one million tons per year, and the coal production volume in July also exceeded the original plan. The Japanese textile industry can expand the number of spindles to 4.5 million by next spring (China's textile industry currently has only 4.754 million spindles). After Japan's foreign trade is opened, Japanese merchants estimate that the Japanese textile industry can restore its former monopoly position within three years and restore silk exports to pre-war levels within five years. Therefore, the fate of the collapse of China's textile and silk industries is difficult to avoid, and the cotton fabric markets of the United Kingdom and its autonomous territories will also be seriously squeezed as a result.
    On the issue of land reform, the U.S. policy is to protect the interests of feudal landlords and allow the feudal exploitation relationship of Japan's socio-economic foundation to continue. Disregarding the opposition of the Soviet Union and other Allied countries, MacArthur arbitrarily formulated a land reform plan (approved by MacArthur on August 14 last year) that favored landlords. The main points of this plan are: (1) Landlords with more than 5 cho of land must sell it to farmers. (2) All land not owned by resident landlords will be compulsorily purchased. (3) Tenant farmers on Honshu, Kyushu, and Shikoku are limited to cultivating 3 cho of land, and tenant farmers on Hokkaido are limited to cultivating 12 cho of land. (4) The price of land purchased by the government is 757 yuan per tan for paddy fields and 464.98 yuan per tan for dry land. (5) Landlords who are forced to have their land purchased by the government are entitled to compensation (130 yuan per tan for paddy fields). (7) Tenant farmers may purchase paddy fields or dry land from the government at the above prices.
    Obviously, this plan is fundamentally contrary to the principle of "land to the tiller," because Japanese farmers are extremely poor and have no money to buy land from landlords. Even so, MacArthur has not seriously implemented this landlord-oriented "land reform." According to regulations, 5 million acres of landlords' land should have been requisitioned by the end of May of this year, but only 300,000 acres have been requisitioned. These requisitioned lands have all fallen into the hands of landlords' relatives, and farmers have not received even one acre. It is conceivable that even if this "land reform plan" is fully implemented, it will only benefit the transformation of land relations from a patriarchal system to a family system, and there is basically no question of destroying the feudal land ownership relationship.
    Under the cover of the U.S. imperialists' above-mentioned control policies that violate the Potsdam Declaration, the forces of Japanese fascist warlords and zaibatsu have been revived and are preparing to make a comeback. A spokesman for the Japanese Foreign Ministry recently openly demanded the establishment of a "new army" including an air force, while Ashida's reckless clamoring for "the return of the Kuril Islands and the Ryukyu Islands" and Ozaki's call for "holding plebiscites in Northeast China, Korea, and Taiwan" are all planned political offensives on the eve of MacArthur's early convening of a peace conference with Japan. In a report drafted by the Japanese government that is as long as 194 pages, it even discusses "Japan's status after the conclusion of the peace treaty with Japan." Japan is not only preparing to strive for the sovereignty of the islands near mainland Japan," but also demanding to join the United Nations as soon as possible. What is particularly insane is that "for Japanese war criminals sentenced to death by international tribunals and thousands of Japanese war criminals with lighter charges," it actually attempts to "conduct its own trials" and dispose of "the final enforcement work." In short, Japanese fascists are very "welcome" to the United States convening a separate peace conference with Japan as soon as possible, because under the control of the United States, the drafting of the peace treaty with Japan "will not restrict Japan's sovereignty" and "will not allow the Allied countries to interfere in Japan's internal affairs." All of this shows that under MacArthur's two years of "control," the Japanese bandits' re-invasion of China and disruption of peace in the Far East have become a real threat.

　　美国两年来对日管制政策
    张上明
    前年九月四日，重光葵代表日皇，在美舰密苏里号签下降书，这一天，也是麦克阿瑟正式进驻日本的日子。
    麦克阿瑟进驻日本，是波茨顿会议的决定，麦氏是以“盟国统帅”，而不是以“美国统帅”的资格去日本受降的。但麦克阿瑟进驻日本的两年中，显然背弃了波茨顿协定关于实现日本政治经济民主化和芟除日本军国主义势力之规定。并根本无视盟国共同管制日本机构——远东委员会与对日委员会的应有职权。
    麦克阿瑟对日的一切措施，及其所欲达成之目标，是以一九四五年九月六日公布之“美国对日一般政策”为其基石。这一政策主要点为第二条所规定：“使日本成立一和平与负责之政府，尊重各国权利，并依照联合国宪章之理想和原则，支持美国的目标”。换言之，战后日本必须是一个“支持”美国扩张政策、反苏反共反民主政策、亡华政策的国家。
    因此，在政治上，美国的政策是支撑天皇制法西斯体系，压迫日本人民的民主运动。目前日本皇室已由麦克阿瑟恢复为军阀，财阀，封建地主反动堡垒之旧观。麦氏不但为天皇卸却了战犯的罪名，而且还替他保持六十三万町步（每町步合中国十五市亩）土地和三十七亿元的资产。经麦克阿瑟批准的日本新宪法，保证天皇掌握军政实权。在天皇制机构周围，美国则网罗并勾结一切朝野政党之反苏反民主势力，如象现政府当权的芦田，西尾，平野及众议院议长松冈等军国主义分子，原都属麦克阿瑟“清洗”指令之列。日本二十名主要战犯的惩办至今延而不决。反苏头子石原莞尔及侵华主犯冈村宁次，还有成千的其他军部法西斯份子则逍遥法外。不但如此，美国正积极扶植日本的军事潜在力，许多充作赔偿的军需工业被保留，变相的参谋本部也以“复员局”名义实际存在。八月中旬美国“泛美”、“北美”两航空公司已在日本设立基点以扩充日本的“航空事业”。美帝国主义还亲自训练成千的日本飞行员。
    麦克阿瑟血腥镇压日本人民的民主运动。今年二月初日本二百万工人倒阁总罢工，麦克阿瑟亲下禁令，并出动坦克协助日本宪兵进行弹压。日本政府新近制定所谓“政党法案”，蓄谋进一步排斥以日共为首的民主力量，内阁书记长亦重申“政治性总罢工”之反动禁令。至于对日本政府歧视和任意屠杀我留日侨胞之暴行，麦克阿瑟一贯采取怂恿态度。
    在经济上，美国的政策是扶植财阀，并通过与财阀之勾结，独占日本的整个经济命脉。麦克阿瑟“解散财阀独占体系”的指令，并没有确实兑现过，但三井公司今天每月还能营利官价三亿五千万日元。实际上，美国对日本财阀不遗余力加以扶植。继七月份煤业贷款十一亿一千四百万元以后，八月十四日麦克阿瑟又批准予日本一亿三千七百万存金，换取五亿美元之贷款。美国进出口银行又计划与日政府订立美棉新贷款之协定。同时，日本的轻重工业因得美国充分原料与设备之供给而迅速发展。例如，日本钢铁工业目前之生产量已达到年产一百万吨，七月份煤产量亦超过原定计划。日本纺织工业明春可扩充锭数至四百五十万支（中国纺织业现有锭数仅四百七十五万四千支），日本对外贸易开放之后，日商估计在三年之内日本纺织业可恢复旧有之垄断地位，于五年之内恢复生丝出口至战前水平。因而中国纺织及生丝业崩溃之厄运断难避免，英国及其自治领之棉织品市场，亦将因此受到严重之排挤。
    在土地改革问题上，美国的政策是维护封建地主的利益使日本社会经济基础之封建剥削关系继续下去。麦克阿瑟不顾苏联及其他盟国之反对，擅自制定地主路线之“土地改革方案”（麦氏于去年八月十四日批准）。这一方案的主要点为：（一）地主超过五町步以上之土地，必须出售给农民。（二）不在地主之土地，悉数与以强制收买。（三）本州、九州、四国佃农以耕种三町步土地、北海道以耕种十二町步土地为限（四）由政府收买之土地价格，水田每段七五七元，旱田四六四·九八元。（五）被强制将土地收买与政府之地主，均可获得补偿金（水田每段补给一三○元）。（七）佃农得以上列价格，向政府购买水田或旱田。
    显然，这一方案根本与“耕者有其田”原则相违背。因为日本农民赤贫如洗，是无钱购买地主土地的。虽然如此，但麦克阿瑟对这一地主路线之“土地改革”亦未认真执行。按规定：至今年五月底应征购之地主土地为五百万英亩，现已征购者只三十万英亩，这些被征购之土地都落到地主亲属手里，农民连一英亩都得不到。可以想见，这一“土地改革方案”即或全部实行，也只有利于土地关系由家长制转化为家族制度，基本上谈不到摧毁封建土地之所有关系。
    在美帝国主义上述反波茨顿宣言之管制政策掩护下，日本法西斯军阀与财阀之势力已经复活，并准备卷土重来。日外务省发言人于日前公开要求建立包括空军在内的“新军”，而芦田“归还千岛群岛与琉球”，和尾崎“在东北、朝鲜、台湾，举行公民投票”之狂妄叫嚣，都是在麦克阿瑟提早召开对日和约会议前夕有计划进行的政治攻势。在日本政府拟就长达一百九十四页的报告中，甚至还谈到“对日和约缔结后日本的地位”。日本不但准备力争接近日本本部各岛屿之主权”，而且还要求早日加入联合国，尤其丧心病狂的是，“对于国际法庭判处死刑及数以千计罪状较轻之日本战犯”，竟妄图“自行审讯”及处置“最后之执法工作”。总而言之，日本法西斯分子万分“欢迎”美国尽早单独召开对日和约会议，因为在美国操纵下，对日和约之起草“不致使日本主权受到限制”，“不致使盟国干涉日本内政”。所有这些都表明：在麦克阿瑟两年“管制”下，日寇重行侵略中国与扰乱远东和平，已成为现实性之威胁。
