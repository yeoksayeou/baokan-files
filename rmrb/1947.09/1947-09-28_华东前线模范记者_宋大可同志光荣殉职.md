Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 26th: Comrade Song Dake, reporter for the Third Branch of the Xinhua News Agency's East China Front Branch and frontline reporter for the Shandong Pictorial, heroically sacrificed during the battle to annihilate Chiang Kai-shek's 57th Division in Shatuji. On the night of the 8th, Comrade Dake followed a commando team of a certain column of the People's Liberation Army to the front line for an interview, only eighty meters away from the enemy. The propaganda section chief advised him to go to the regimental headquarters for the time being, but Comrade Dake resolutely refused. He said, "This battle is of great significance. I want to report the heroic assault of our soldiers that I have personally witnessed." During the fierce battle in the middle of the night, Comrade Dake was unfortunately hit by a bullet and sacrificed his life. Comrade Dake was twenty-four years old, a native of Yixian County, Shandong Province, a member of the Chinese Communist Party, and a young art worker. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, he was active on the front lines for a long time. After the outbreak of the Patriotic Self-Defense War, he went to the column to engage in interview and reporting work. His spirit of facing the soldiers, integrating with reality, and serving the troops was deeply loved by the commanders and fighters. When the sad news came out, the entire column mourned in unison. The director of the political department of a certain regiment personally supervised the encoffining. The leaders of the column repeatedly inquired by telephone about the circumstances of Comrade Dake's sacrifice. Guo Jisheng, deputy battalion commander and combat hero of East China, stopped eating when he heard the news and was extremely saddened. The "Guo Jisheng" fighter was very familiar with Comrade Dake and both liked to call him "Big Brother". Hearing that Comrade Dake had sacrificed, he pounded his chest and clenched his fists in grief and vowed to avenge this revenge. Comrade Dake's remains have been buried together with Comrade Hao Yinggui, deputy battalion commander of the Shandong combat hero assault battalion, who was famous for killing the bandit chieftain Liu Guitang and also sacrificed in this battle.
