　　Ancheng Base Point
  　Methods for Protecting Ramie from Rain and Flooding
    [Report from Changzhi by this newspaper] Ramie accounts for the vast majority of special crops in the entire county. It is a crop that cannot withstand drought or flooding. After about 100 days of growth, excessive rain will cause black spots to appear, resembling tiger skin, and then it will rot. Now is the time for harvesting ramie, which is also the time with the most rain. The Ancheng base point specifically convened a technical committee, and based on historical experience, researched the following methods for protecting ramie: (1) When building ramie retting ponds, pay attention to choosing locations that are sunny, on high ground, and build ponds on the south side of wells to ensure the ramie can be removed from the pond one day earlier. (2) Build more ponds, harvest quickly, and ret quickly, and don't let the ponds sit idle. (3) If it is constantly raining, and the ramie is just retted, the ropes binding the ramie should all be removed. Loosen the waist ropes at the slightly upward position, letting the branches stand loosely in the field, with ventilation as the most important factor. After two days, turn them over inside and out. This can prevent rotting for five or six days. (4) When retting ramie, remove all the bad ramie to avoid spoiling the good ramie. (5) When it is almost time to retrieve the ramie, if the weather is about to rain, retrieve it when it is still a bit raw to prevent rain and extend the time it can last. (6) When drying ramie, if the sky is clouding up quickly, seize the time to turn it over and dry both sides of the ramie. Otherwise, if the sky becomes overcast and rainy, one side of the ramie will turn green and the other side will turn white, and the color will never change. (Quan Cheng, Hu Bao)

　　安城基点
  　雨涝天保麻办法
    【本报长治讯】全县白麻在特种作物内占绝大部分，是受不得旱涝的一种作物，长够百天左右，雨淋过度，便要出黑斑点，象虎皮似的，就烂起来了，现在正是收割麻的时期，也是雨最多的时候。安城基点特召开技委会，根据历史的经验，研究出如下几点保麻办法：（１）打沤麻池的时候，注意地方位置向阳、地高、及在井南面打起的池，能早出池一天。（２）多打池、快割、快沤，不要让池闲了。（３）总是不断的下雨，将麻恰沤好了，应将麻绳全部腰绳解去，将稍部的腰绳往上一摸，交枝的散立在地里，以透风为最适合，停两天就里外翻过一遍，这样能支持五、六天不烂。（４）沤麻时将坏麻全部去掉，以免搅坏好麻。（５）快到捞麻的时候，若天气快要下雨，较生一些就捞，以防下雨，多支持时间。（６）晒麻时天气起云快阴的时候，要抓紧时间翻晒，将麻两面晒过，否则天阴下雨便会使麻一面绿一面白，永久不变色。（全成、虎保）
