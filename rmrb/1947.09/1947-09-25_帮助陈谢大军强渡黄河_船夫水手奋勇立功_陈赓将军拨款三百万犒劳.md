Xinhua News Agency, Yuxi Front, 23rd: General Chen Geng has allocated three million yuan to reward the boatmen and sailors who assisted our army in crossing the river. Attached was a letter of thanks saying: You have worked day and night, fearing neither fatigue nor difficulties, and heroically completed this great task, rendering great service to the cause of the people's liberation. I hereby express my gratitude to you on behalf of all the commanders and fighters. All the ferries were built from scratch day and night within half a month. More than six hundred boatmen along the river rushed to participate in this great action long ago. Cui Bingyi, a 65-year-old heroic boatman from Changquan Village, volunteered to transport the first assault team to shore. More than 50 boatmen, militiamen, and members of the Yellow River Detachment from Du Ba Lian even crossed the river ahead of the main force to occupy the position. From dawn on August 23rd, the boatmen, disregarding the Kuomintang planes' round-the-clock bombing, transported the soldiers across the river in a tense manner. On the morning of the 23rd, Chen Guohua's large boat from Changle Village made twelve trips, and most of the boats made more than fifty consecutive trips. On the night of August 25th, more than eighty sailors from Qinghekou, carrying seven boats, went into the water and pulled them down the river to the Ni湾 ferry crossing, braving the gunfire of the Chiang bandits. Although the boatmen were so tired that they could not eat, they quickly and safely ferried all our personnel across.

Xinhua News Agency, Yuxi Front, 23rd: Our special correspondent, Mu Xin, reports on the scene of Chen Xie's army's heroic crossing of the Yellow River: At dawn on August 23rd, our army formed five powerful firepower points on the north bank of the crossing on a 25-mile front. In the quiet and slightly cold air, a row of heroic heavy artillery pieces aimed at the Kuomintang bandit bunkers on the opposite bank, and heavy machine guns targeted the doors and loopholes of the strongholds. The assault troops of the 7th Company and 9th Company of a certain regiment were the first to board the boats, and the militiamen of Du Ba Lian, known as the "river defense fortress" of Jiyuan, crossed the river first to provide cover. Seven large boats sped diagonally towards the opposite bank. When they reached the middle of the river, the first burst of machine-gun fire from the Kuomintang bandits on the opposite bank rang out, and then our guns and cannons fired in unison, and the Kuomintang bandits did not fire a second shot. At this time, we saw our heavy artillery spitting out a constant stream of bullets, and machine guns firing ten thousand golden lines. The bunkers on the opposite bank, under sustained bombardment, burst into flames several feet high, turning half the sky red. The warriors at the head of the first batch of boats, relying on sandbags, swept the Chiang bandit troops on the beachhead with machine guns in the turbulent current. When the first boat of Cui Bingyi, the 65-year-old sailor hero, reached the shore, it was less than five minutes away from the boat's departure, and only one person was slightly injured after a whole regiment had been ferried over. After the infantry rushed to the beach, the Chiang bandit troops in the bunkers along the coast turned and fled. In the morning light and clouds, the bugle call encouraged every soldier, and they all scrambled to seize the first hill. The warriors quickly climbed up the bunkers with ladders under the cover of rifles, and captured them with a few grenades. The vanguard's arrow went straight to the most heavily fortified Shishantou. Zhao Chengqing, the squad leader of the 7th Company's 3rd Squad, and soldier Yang Jinshuo rushed to the front. Yang Jinshuo captured six people and six guns by himself, and Zhao Chengqing seized a light machine gun. The whole squad of ten people captured a total of twenty-five Chiang bandit troops, seized one machine gun, and eighteen rifles, exceeding the plan to annihilate the enemy and render meritorious service that was set before departure in the first battle. More than 1,200 enemy troops, including the deputy regimental commander of the defending forces in the area, were quickly annihilated. The ten-caliber heavy mountain gun borrowed from the 15th Division in Luoyang two days ago was also seized by the People's Liberation Army. Zhu Fuhe, the squad leader of the 5th Squad of the 1st Artillery Company of the 15th Division, who was liberated along with the gun, handed over the gun and seventy-two shells, saying: "We received a total of eighty rounds when we set out, and only fired five rounds." In this dawn with the sound of roosters crowing, the three-hundred-mile Yellow River defense line, which the Chiang bandits relied on as a natural barrier, completely collapsed.

    帮助陈谢大军强渡黄河
    船夫水手奋勇立功
    陈赓将军拨款三百万犒劳
    【新华社豫西前线二十三日电】陈赓将军拨款三百万元，奖赏协助我大军渡河的船夫水手。并附一感谢信说：你们日以继夜的不怕疲劳，不怕困难，英勇的完成了伟大任务，为人民解放事业立了大功，特代表全体指战员向你们致谢。此次全部渡船都是半月内日夜加工赶造的，沿河六百水手老早就赶来参加这一伟大的行动。长泉村六十五岁的水手老英雄崔炳义自告奋勇运送突击队第一船靠岸。杜八联的船夫、民兵及黄河支队五十余人且在大军渡河前，先行涉渡对岸，占领阵地。从八月二十三日拂晓起，船夫们不顾蒋机的昼夜轮番轰炸，紧张的运送战士过河，二十三日上午长乐村陈国华那只大船都赶渡了十二次，大部分船只连续赶渡五十多小时。八月二十五日夜，清河口水手八十余人，带着七只船下水，冒着蒋匪枪弹顺河拉到牛湾渡口。船夫们虽疲倦得不能吃东西，但还是迅速的把我军全部人员安全渡完。
    【新华社豫西前线二十三日电】本社特派记者穆欣报导：陈谢大军强渡黄河天险的情景称：八月二十三日拂晓，自渡口北岸我军于二十五里的正面组成五个强大的火力点，在沉静而微寒的气流中一列英雄式的重炮，瞄准对岸蒋匪碉堡，重机枪对中堡垒的门窗和枪眼。某团七连和九连的突击队员首批登船，号称济源“河防堡垒”的杜八联民兵在前涉渡掩护，七只大船斜向对岸飞驶而去。当渡至中流时，对岸蒋匪响起第一声机枪，于是我军枪炮齐鸣，蒋匪就再没有打出第二枪了。此时但见我方重炮吐出穿梭不息的弹雨，机枪飞射万条金线，对岸碉堡在持久的轰击中，冒起数丈高的大火，映红了半边天。首批船头的勇士们凭依沙包，在急流汹涌中，用机枪横扫滩头阵地上的蒋匪。六十五岁水手老英雄崔炳义的第一船靠岸时，离开船时还不到五分钟，渡完一个整团仅有一名轻伤。步兵们冲上河滩后，沿岸地堡中的蒋匪掉头逃窜。在晨光云彩中，冲锋号鼓舞着每个战士，他们都争相抢占第一个山头。勇士们仅在步枪的掩护下迅速扶梯爬上碉堡，几颗手榴弹就占领了它。先锋部队的箭头就直向敌防最坚固的石山头迫进。七连第三班赵承青班长和战士杨金锁冲在最前头，杨金锁一个人就俘获了六个人和六条枪，赵承青夺得了一挺轻机枪。全班十个人共俘虏蒋匪二十五名，缴获机枪一挺，步枪十八支，第一仗就超过了出发前所订的歼敌立功计划。该地守敌正副团长以下一千二百余人迅遭歼灭。两天前才从洛阳十五师借来的十生的五口径重山炮也被解放军缴获，和炮同获解放的第十五师炮兵第一连五班班长朱傅和交出炮和七十二发炮弹时说：“出发时共领八十发，才打了五发”，就在这个晨鸡竞唱的黎明中，蒋匪凭恃为天险的三百里黄河防线就完全崩溃了。
