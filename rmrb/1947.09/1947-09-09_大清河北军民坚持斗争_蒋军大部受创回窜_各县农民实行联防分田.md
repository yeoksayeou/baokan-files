Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, September 7th: The Chiang Kai-shek troops invading the Ping-Jin-Bao triangle area have been continuously attacked by local troops and civilians, and their main force has fled back to the Ping-Bao line. Our troops and civilians, persisting in interior line operations, continue to victoriously strike the enemy. The Jizhong Military Region recently issued a communique stating: "The enemy "mopping up" the Daqing River North area has been attacked by us everywhere. In addition, due to insufficient troop strength and a hollow rear, the 43rd Division of its 94th Army and the 4th Division of the 13th Army successively fled back to the Ping-Han line and near Beiping in the latter half of last month. At the moment, only seven regiments of the 16th Army of Chiang Kai-shek and the puppet troops from various places still occupy the area north of the Daqing River, gathered in the narrow area between Gu'an, Ba County, Xincheng, and Xiong County, building roads and碉堡, and carrying out zonal "encirclement and suppression." Our heroic troops and civilians persisting in Hebei have repeatedly won victories in the anti-"encirclement and suppression" battles. The enemy's 碉堡 line along the Daqing River between Xiong County and Xinzhen was completely destroyed overnight. The 碉堡 in Daningzhuang near Ba County was also destroyed. Our armed forces behind enemy lines near Shengfang in western Tianjin and north of the Yongding River are also extremely active. Our Jinwu (newly established county between Tianjin West and Wuqing) local armed forces intercepted an enemy vehicle in the latter half of last month. Militias recently fought the enemy four times east of Shengfang. At the end of last month, a large detachment active north of the Yongding River defeated the enemy who came out of Panggezhuang and other places to harass, killing more than 20 enemies.

Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, September 7th: In Gu'an, Anci, Ba County and other counties, where intense anti-"mopping up" operations are underway, peasants are implementing joint defense and land distribution, continuing the land reform. In An and Ba counties, more than 5,000 poor peasants have gained more than 155,000 mu of land. When Anci Ciping's twenty villages struggled against the big local tyrant Zhao Meng＠, Chiang's troops came to harass but were repelled by the joint defense militia. The militia of another village in the county repelled Chiang's puppet troops three times to cover the emancipation movement in nearby villages. The Farmers' Association of a village in Ba County was also divided into an armed group and a struggle group, fighting guerrillas while struggling, and implementing collective eating and sleeping when the situation was tense. More than 20 villages on the border of Qingyuan and Anxin east of Baoding have jointly liquidated the big landlord Xu Yunting, and the Chiang's puppet regime in the area has been destroyed. In the Baigou River area east of Zhuo County, the land reform movement has been popularized in more than 50 villages under the development of political offensive. In Daxing and Wuqing on the Beining Line, the first batch of emancipated backbones have completed their training and returned to their villages to launch the land reform movement.
