[This dispatch from our newspaper’s correspondents in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region on September 11th] Our Fourth Military Sub-district's armed forces have struck awe into the suburbs of Xinxiang City, greatly alarming the enemy and the puppets. At dawn on August 10th, a unit of our Fourth Military Sub-district's armed forces advanced towards Jiazhi. Upon discovering this, the enemy Wang Sanzhu's Fourth Brigade immediately fled north. They were intercepted by troops from the Fifth and Eighth Military Sub-districts, causing the enemy's Fourth Brigade of over two hundred men to scatter in all directions. We captured over forty of them alive, seizing two machine guns and over twenty rifles. At 4:30 PM, our troops divided and launched an attack on Wang Sanzhu's lair in Xiaodian Village (eighteen *li* from Xinxiang). Our troops charged bravely, and by 6:30 PM, most of Wang Sanzhu's troops and the puppet Yan Jin County government had fled in panic. Their covering force, the Third Brigade, also fled west at 9:30 PM under our attacks. We then entered Wang Sanzhu's lair in Xiaodian Village, taking it over. We also burned down the watchtowers inside and outside the village. On the 21st, the enemy Wang Sanzhu's troops attacked the southwestern fort of Xiaodian, but were repelled by us. Since then, our army has awed the suburbs of Xinxiang, and the enemy in Xinxiang is extremely alarmed, not daring to take a single step outside.

[This dispatch from our newspaper’s correspondent in the Taiyue Region on September 7th] The peasant armed struggle in the new areas of Southern Shanxi has achieved another victory. Linjin has captured over forty Chiang Kai-shek armed secret agents, including Yan Jiasi, Yao Jiansheng, and Wang Dandan, who will be severely punished. As the land reform movement among the peasants in Southern Shanxi intensifies, Chiang Kai-shek has released a large number of armed secret agents to collude with landlords and carry out terrorist assassinations against the peasants. This is particularly rampant in Wanquan, Anyi, Yishi, Linjin, and other counties. The peasants have also learned from the struggle that they must use armed forces to counter the counter-revolutionary armed forces. In Linjin, after secret agents successively massacred our peasant association cadres Zhao Fareen, Kong Fanlin, and three others on the 7th, 9th, and 11th of last month, district cadres and militiamen rose up to capture the secret agents. The culprits Yan Jiasi, Yao Jiansheng, Wang Dandan, and over forty others have now all been captured and handed over to the masses for disposal.

[This dispatch from our newspaper’s correspondents in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region on September 10th] The enemy "Homecoming Corps" entrenched in Juancheng went to various villages to seize grain and arrest people. Our county's large contingent, in order to resolutely protect the interests of the masses, cooperated with a militia unit to attack the enemy stronghold in Sanyihe Village on the night of the 20th of last month. Those entrenched in the stronghold were the puppet Seventh District Department and three puppet township governments, totaling about two hundred and fifty people. When the enemy inside the stronghold discovered our troops, they were panic-stricken. After a burst of grenade attacks by us, the enemy scattered in disarray. We killed, wounded, and captured over fifty enemy soldiers, seizing two warhorses, four rifles, and one pistol. This victory struck a blow against the enemy's frantic activities of dispersing to seize grain and arrest people, strengthened the confidence of our cadres, militiamen, and the masses in persisting in guerrilla warfare, and opened up the dispirited situation in Northern Juancheng of the past twenty days.

    【本报太岳七日电】晋南新区农民武装斗争，又获胜利。临晋捕获蒋记武装特务严加思、姚建生、王旦旦等四十余人。当晋南农民土改运动日趋紧张之际，蒋介石放出大批武装特务勾结地主，对农民进行恐布暗杀，在万泉、安邑、猗氏、临晋等县尤为猖獗，农民亦从斗争中得到经验，必须以武装对付反革命武装。临晋在特务于上月七、九、十一日连续屠杀我农会干部赵发人、孔繁林等五人后，区干部与民兵皆奋起捉拿特务，现已将祸首严加思、姚建生、王旦旦等四十余人，全部捕获，交给群众处理。
    【本报冀鲁豫十日电】盘踞鄄城之敌“还乡团”，到各村抢粮抓人，我县大队为坚决保护群众利益，配合民兵一部，于上月二十日夜晚，向三义和村敌据点袭击。盘踞该据点者，系伪七区部和三个伪乡公所、共约二百五十余人，当该据点内发现我队伍时，即惊慌失措，经我一阵手榴弹的突击后，敌已跑得五零七散，我毙伤俘敌五十余名，缴战马两匹，步枪四支，短枪一支。这一胜利，打击了敌人分散抢粮抓人的疯狂活动，增强了我干部民兵与群众坚持游击战的胜利信心，鄄北二十天来的消沉局面从此打开。
