　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 15th: Paris - The strikes and demonstrations by the French working class against the Ramadier economic policies and the decrees reducing rations are escalating further. As of the 12th, all major cities in France held protest demonstrations. The large-scale demonstration by the working people of Marseille on the 10th caused many shops to close and port cargo could not be loaded or unloaded. Similar demonstrations took place on the same day in five French provinces. The demonstration in Bordeaux, southern France, was attended by 80,000 people. On the 11th, a mass rally of 30,000 people was held in Lille, northern France. On the 12th, strikes and demonstrations spread to cities in central France, such as Nevers, Montauban and Poitiers in the west, Caen in the northwest, and Arles in the south. The authorities in Montauban, in their shame and anger, even used American tear gas and water cannons against workers attempting to climb over fences and rush into the county government building. In Mianlis-Pins, southern France, many shop assistants and small merchants participated in the demonstrations. Alarmed by the strike movement, the Ramadier authorities hurriedly announced the establishment of a committee a few days ago to draft a so-called plan to "curb" inflation and high prices, in an attempt to alleviate the anger of the French people. However, the French people mostly ignored this announcement. Trade unions in Paris demanded that the authorities quickly announce their plans and insisted that capital gains taxes must be increased and military spending reduced. L'Humanité stated that the only solution lies in changing government policies and establishing a truly democratic government.

　　法工潮仍高涨
  　各大城市同时举行示威
    【新华社陕北十五日电】巴黎讯：法国工人阶级反对拉马第经济政策及减低口粮法令的罢工与示威运动，正进一步高涨中。迄十二日止，法国一切较大的城市，都举行了抗议的示威游行。十日马赛劳动人民的大示威，曾使许多商店关门，港口货物无法起卸。类似的示威同一天在法国五个省份中进行。法国南部波尔多城的示威，参加者达八万人。十一日北部里尔港有三万人大集会。十二日罢工与示威则遍及法国中部的内维尔，西部的蒙城与波亚第，西北部的克恩，南部的亚莱斯等城市。蒙城当局在羞怒之下，竟以美国的催泪弹和水龙头对付那些企图爬过栏杆冲进县府的工人。在南部的米安里斯·屏斯，示威者中有许多店员与小商人参加。震慑于罢工运动的拉马第当局，急忙于日前宣布成立一委员会，草拟所谓“制止”通物膨胀与物价高涨的计划，以图缓和法国人民的愤激。但法国人民对此宣告多漠然置之。巴黎的职工会要求当局赶快公布其计划，并且提出必须增收资本所得税与减少军事预算。人道报则称：唯一办法在于改变政府政策，并成立真正的民主政府。
