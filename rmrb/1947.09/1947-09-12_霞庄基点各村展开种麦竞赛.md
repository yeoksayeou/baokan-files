　　Wheat Planting Competition Unfolds in Villages of the Xiazhuang Base Area

　　[This dispatch from Li Cheng] The Xiazhuang Base Area convened a meeting of cadres, heroes, and activists on the 24th of last month to study the current central tasks and decided to actively prepare for wheat planting, manure accumulation, manure transportation, and repairing wheat fields, combined with weeding and consolidating mutual aid groups; women should actively spin and weave, preparing autumn cotton-padded clothing. Following this, a mutual competition was launched to strive for great achievements in seasonal planting. Zhuangtou proposed a challenge to Xiazhuang, with the main conditions being: the village's entire wheat field area of 1385.9 mu should be plowed twice within eleven days, and manure transported; generally, it should be plowed three times, and the labor force should weed the autumn fields in four days, then shift to repairing wheat fields, and start sowing three days before the White Dew solar term, completing the sowing of the main crop within ten days of the solar term, applying more than 35 loads of fertilizer per mu, and expanding the stubble wheat area by 400 mu, combined with consolidating mutual aid groups; the village's 180 women should spin 255 jin of yarn and weave 225 jin of cloth within twenty days. There will be an inspection every seven days and a summary every three weeks, with District Committee Secretary Li Longxing and Yang Sentang invited to be judges. In addition to responding to the above challenge conditions, Xiazhuang will add the following conditions: half of the wheat fields should be planted by dibbling and transplanting, and half of the wheat fields should be planted with a two-legged seeder, the spun yarn should be fine and good, and the woven cloth should be wide and flat, and they will also propose a competition with Yuan Village. Villages such as Libao and Beishe, Qijiajie and Tinghe have all been drawn into the competition to establish meritorious service, with seven villages reporting an expansion of wheat fields by 2,000 mu, guaranteeing supply next year and supporting the front lines in digging out the old roots.
