　　Landlords Sabotage Production
  　Shahe Farmers See Through Conspiracy
    [This newspaper Shahe dispatch] During the seedling thinning period, while rectifying mutual aid, it was discovered that many landlords and targets of struggle were disrupting and causing trouble within the groups. After being discovered and recognized by the masses, they were all removed. × Laiming, a target of struggle from Daqian Village in the First District, grazed sheep in the mutual aid group and had four sheep killed by the masses in one month, including a leading large ram. The masses were most dissatisfied and gave him advice, saying, "The way you are, if you have nowhere to vent your anger, you take it out on the sheep! If you graze them for a year, the whole flock will be dead!" He was immediately kicked out of the group. In Liushigang Village in the Second District, a landlord provoked discord between two brothers in a mutual aid group by stuffing a chicken belonging to the younger brother into his older brother's quilt, suffocating it to death, so that the two brothers would have a conflict. After arguing for a while, they realized that it was the landlord who was causing trouble. After discussion by the masses in each group, everyone became more vigilant and did not allow landlords to stay in the groups. Du Jingchun, a target of struggle from Northeast Liu in the Fifth District, used the belongings of the masses in the mutual aid group and was very domineering. In particular, when he returned the farm tools and livestock to the masses, he used them as if they were his own. When using the livestock, he said, "This livestock originally had a very good halter, how did you make it like this?" When he arrived in the field, he said, "When I cultivated this land, it was so long and so short..." The group members were unhappy, saying that they had turned over and would not put up with his air. After discussion by the masses, they were all purged. (Kuilin)

　　地主破坏生产
  　沙河农民识破阴谋
    【本报沙河讯】在锄苗时期整顿互助中，发现不少地主斗争对象，在组内破坏捣乱，经群众发觉识破后，均被清除出去。一区大欠村斗争对象×来明，在互助组内放羊，在一个月内就给群众打死了四只羊，其中还有一个领头大羯羊，群众最为不满，给他提意见说：“象你这样，气没地方使，就往羊身上出气哩，你要给放上一年，一群羊就死完了！”当即把他赶出组内。二区刘石岗村地主在互助组内挑拨某弟兄俩不和，把兄弟的一只鸡子卷在他哥哥的被子内闷死了，好让他弟兄两人矛盾，两人争吵了一番后，才知道是地主捣的鬼。后经各组群众讨论，大家都提高了警惕，都不让地主在组内。五区东北留斗争对象杜景春在互助组内使用群众的东西，还很霸道，特别是他退还给群众的农具牲口等，他用时还和用自己的一样，使牲口时说：“这牲口原来笼头很好，你怎么给弄成这样了？”到了地里说：“这地在我手里养种时，是这么长，那么短……”闹的组员们都不高兴，说咱翻了身不受他一股子气，经群众讨论后，把他们都清洗出去了。（奎林）
