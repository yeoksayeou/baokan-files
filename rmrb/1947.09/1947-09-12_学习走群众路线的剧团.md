A Theater Troupe Learning to Follow the Mass Line
　　Zhang Fuqiang

　　Starting July 25th, the Vanguard Theater Troupe went to a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army for an eight-day tour. On the afternoon of the same day, at 6:00 PM, they first performed for a certain unit of the 20th Brigade, which was the main force attacking Boai, Henan. The evening's program included "Wang Keqin Class" and "Merit Citation," created by Comrade Hu Qi, with music selected by Comrades Gao Shuji, Liu Qingkai, and Shi Yan. The troupe's own creations included the one-act opera "Returning the Donkey," created by Comrade Liu Qingkai with music by Shi Yan, the fast-clapper talk "Seizing the Field Gun," and the songs "Great Victory in the Qin-Bo Campaign" and "Glorious Old Second Regiment," among other wonderful programs.

　　The evening lasted about four hours, and the audience maintained high spirits throughout. The biggest regret was that when "Merit Citation" was being performed, a heavy rain suddenly started, so it had to be stopped. Everyone demanded that it be performed again next time.

　　On the 26th, the unit's Regimental Commander Tang and Political Commissar Zhou braved the rain to visit the theater troupe to express their appreciation. Regimental Commander Tang said:

　　"The more I watch your plays, the more simple and sincere they seem. You perform well, and we couldn't achieve such results even with half a month of classes. It has a great educational significance for the troops. When the soldiers see performances about their own affairs, their eyes widen and their mouths crack into big smiles. Some theater troupes only perform old plays, and the soldiers start to fall asleep when they watch them, and watching too much can even corrupt the soldiers. Some people only know how to look at pretty women..."

　　For a military theater troupe, these few comments should be considered the highest praise because they simply explain how to serve the soldiers.

　　The success of this evening was mainly due to mastering the very clear direction of serving the soldiers. Looking at the content of all the programs: "Wang Keqin Class" is a performance of internal military education; "Merit Citation" is a reflection of the merit campaign in the rear; "Returning the Donkey" is a model of the military's good mass discipline; "Seizing the Field Gun" vividly narrates the deeds of the military's combat heroes. In a word, it is: performing the affairs of the victorious "soldiers" in the patriotic self-defense war.

　　Secondly, the drama reflects the current reality. Looking at the plots of the programs created by the troupe: "Returning the Donkey" is about the story of the Eleventh Company of the Third Battalion in the audience. It tells the story of a soldier in the newly liberated area mobilizing a local to take a sick comrade with a donkey, but the local, based on his experience in the Chiang-occupied area, determined that the Eighth Route Army comrades' concern for him was to grab him to be a soldier, so he slipped away after leaving the donkey on the road. Later, that comrade personally sent the donkey to his home. This made the local family realize the essence of the Eighth Route Army serving the people from their own experience and automatically boiled water to comfort the passing troops.

　　As soon as this play was performed, the comrades of the Eleventh Company beamed and said:

　　"This is our company's business."

　　The next day, Cao Jiafeng, the instructor of the Third Battalion, talked to others about returning the donkey, he said:

　　"Our Eleventh Company returned a donkey, and there is another one that we didn't have time to return, we should send it to the local as soon as possible."

　　The fast-clapper talk "Seizing the Field Gun" tells how the unit bravely captured Boai, seized the enemy's field gun with unparalleled tenacity, and the joyful mood of the victors at that time. At the end of the fast-clapper talk, it ended with a chorus of more than ten people singing a song.

　　When the fast-clapper talk mentioned every hero on the stage, the group, squad, platoon, and company to which the heroes belonged burst into laughter. After the fast-clapper talk was over, the cadres said:

　　"Very exciting."

　　The soldiers said:

　　"Well said."

　　They felt it was well said, which means they felt they fought well, and felt the glory of the heroes.

　　The songs they sang were all about the unit's own affairs. Now their songs are: sing about the heroes wherever you go.

　　In this way, the Vanguard Theater Troupe quickly reflected the current life of the masses in artistic works, and then educated the current masses, telling them: what you have done for the people, and how you should continue to serve the people and do for the people.

　　To do this is not difficult, but it is not easy either. In the past and present, some theater troupes have encountered difficulties in this regard. There have also been successes, but they are still in the minority.

　　It is no accident that the troupe can master the direction of serving the soldiers and quickly reflect the current reality.

　　They abandoned the old drama tradition and appeared with a new style. The conservative idea of writing a play in a few months, rehearsing a play, and having to perform it under gas lights and on a formal stage has gone bankrupt. Is anyone here opposing material civilization and exquisite workmanship? No, of course we can if we have such conditions. There is no doubt that we will perform "soldiers" under better conditions in the future.

　　Listen to a simple commander, Comrade Tang Wancheng's view on this issue:

　　"The field troops leave as soon as they say they will, so there is not much time to build a big stage. We don't even know if we can watch it after it's built. Once a theater troupe insisted on building a big stage before performing, and Brigade Commander Ma said, 'We have to leave as soon as there is a situation. If they insist on a big stage to perform, we will have to not watch it.' It's good that you are like this, you can perform anywhere, it's fast and simple, and the soldiers are very happy to watch it even with two sesame oil lamps."

　　No wonder he said: "The more I watch, the more simple and sincere it seems."

　　Their phenomenon of building cars behind closed doors has passed. Many comrades have been sent to the battlefield to collect materials, to work temporarily in the troops, and to go into the life of the "soldiers." In the four months of combat, Zhu Dan, Zhao Ziyue, Cao Xin, Shi Yan, Liu Qingkai, Gao Shuji, Cao Zhanfang, and other 16 comrades contributed more than 300 articles, and nearly 150 articles were published in the People's Daily, Xinhua Daily, People's Warrior, Battlefield News, and literary magazines. What is particularly valuable is that 90% of them are comrades who are just learning to write, and most comrades have been praised by various units in this regard.

　　The leaders of the theater troupe have already learned to use new leadership methods, and it is the first time to carry out merit-making in the theater troupe, which is now in the initial stage of evaluation. Enthusiasm has been highly promoted.

　　After the campaign of praising each other in the whole troupe was launched, comrades used meal times to praise each other, and the atmosphere of striving for progress was extremely strong.

　　The mutual aid group, which developed from the daily life of the youth team, has developed into ideological mutual aid, mutual aid in correcting diaries, mutual aid in learning, and mutual aid in carrying things during marches, and the whole team is full of vitality.

　　Rehearsing a six-scene opera in nine days, two one-act operas, a fast-clapper talk that takes half an hour, practicing three songs well, the band practicing the music of an opera in one day... They are working tirelessly.

　　The result of the Vanguard Theater Troupe's efforts is that it has begun to touch the methods of the mass line to complete the glorious task of serving the soldiers.

　　July 27th, Qinghua

　　学习走群众路线的剧团
    张富强
    七月二十五日起，先锋剧团赴人民解放军某部作八天巡回公演，当天下午六时于豫北某地，首先给主攻博爱的二零部队某部献演。晚会节目有“王克勤班”和胡奇同志创作，高树基，刘清凯，石岩同志选曲之“报功单”。由该团自己创作者，计有刘清凯同志创作，石岩同志配曲之独幕歌剧“还驴”，石岩同志创作之快板“夺野炮”和“沁博战役大胜利”“光荣的老二团”歌曲等精彩节目。
    晚会历时约四小时，观众始终保持高涨情绪。最遗憾的是演到“报功单”时，大雨骤至，遂告终止。大家都要求下次一定要补演。
    二十六日该部唐团长周政委冒大雨亲赴剧团慰问，唐团长说：
    ——你们的戏我越看越朴素，演得好，我们上半个月课也收不到这样成绩。对部队教育意义大得很，战士看到演他们自己的事情，都瞪着和眼裂着大嘴笑。有的剧团光演旧戏，战士们看看就要睡觉，看多了还能把战士看坏了，有些人就光会看花媳妇……。
    这几句评语对一个部队剧团说来，应算作最高的评价，因为它通俗的说明了应如何为兵服务的问题。
    这个晚会之所以成功，主要是掌握了十分明确的为兵服务的方向。从全部节目的内容来看：“王克勤班”是表演部队内部教育，“报功单”是部队立功运动在后方的反映；“还驴”是部队良好的群众纪律的模范；“夺野炮”是活生生的叙述出部队战斗英雄的功迹。一句话就是：演的是爱国自卫战争中胜利的“兵”的事情。
    其次是戏剧反映了当前的现实。从该团自己创作的节目的情节来看：“还驴”写的就是观众当中的三营十一连的故事。写一个战士在新解放区，动员老乡带着毛驴送病号，但老乡根据在蒋占区的经验，断定八路同志对他的关心是想抓他去当兵，所以半路丢了毛驴就溜走了。后来那位同志又亲自把毛驴送到他家。使老乡一家人从切身体验中认识了八路军为人民的本质，自动烧开水去慰劳过路的队伍。
    这幕戏一上演，十一连的同志眉开眼笑的说：
    ——这是我们连里的事情。
    三营教导员曹家风同志第二天对别人谈到还驴的事，他说：
    ——我们十一连还了一个驴，还有一个没来得及还，赶快给老乡送去才好。
    快板“夺野炮”叙说该部如何英勇的攻下博爱，用无比的顽强夺取敌人野炮以及当时胜利者愉快的心情，快板说到末了以十余人大合唱一个歌子结束。
    当快板说到台下每一个英雄时，英雄们的四周，他所在的组、班、排和连就扬起了一阵欢笑。快板一说完，干部都说：
    ——很紧张。
    战士们说：
    ——说得好。
    他们感到说得好，就是感到自己打得好，感到了功臣的光荣。
    演唱的歌曲都是唱的该部自己的事。他们现在唱歌是：走到那里唱那里的英雄。
    就这样，先锋剧团把当前群众的生活，迅速的反映到艺术作品里，再去教育当前的群众，告诉他们：你为人民做了什么，还应该怎样为人民和为人民作什么。
    要作到这点，并不难可也不容易。过去和现在都有些剧团曾经在这方面碰到困难。获得成功的也有过，仍然是少数。
    该团能够掌握为兵服务的方向，迅速反映当前现实也非偶然。
    他们抛弃了旧的戏剧传统，以崭新的作风出现，所谓几个月写一个戏，排一个戏，非在汽灯下，正规舞台上演出不可的保守观念是破产了，这里是否有人在反对物质文明和精雕细刻呢。不会，有那样条件当然可以，我们将来要在更好的条件下演“兵”当无疑问。
    请听一个纯朴的指挥员唐万成同志对这问题的见解：
    ——野战部队说走就走，那有很多功夫去搞大舞台，搭起来还不知看成看不成呐。有一次一个剧团一定要搭大台子才演，马旅长就说：“一有情况就得走，他们定要大台子才演，我们就只好不看算了。”你们这样就好，随便那里都能演，又快又简单，点两盏麻油灯战士看起来也怪高兴。
    无怪他说：“越看越朴素。”
    他们闭门造车的现象已经过去了。很多的同志被派到战场去收集材料，去部队暂时工作，走到“兵”的生活中去。在四个月的战斗中，该团朱丹、赵子岳、曹欣、石岩、刘清凯、高树基、曹展芳等十六位同志投稿三百余篇，在人民日报、新华日报、人民战士、战场报和文艺杂志发表的将近一百五十篇，创作歌剧话剧剧本十个，歌曲十三个，尤可贵者是其中百分之九十是初学写作的同志，大部分同志在这方面都曾被各部队表扬。
    剧团的领导已经学着运用新的领导方式，在剧团开展立功还是首创，现已初步进行评功。积极性被高度的发扬起来。
    全团的表好运动开展后，同志之间利用吃饭时间互相表好，上进的空气极为浓厚。
    青年队从日常生活发展起来的互助组，已发展到思想互助，互助改日记互助学习，和行军中互助背东西，全体充满朝气。
    九天排完一个六场歌剧，两个独幕歌剧，一个要说半点钟的快板，练好三个歌子，乐队一天练好一个歌剧的曲子……他们不顾疲劳的工作着。
    先锋剧团努力的结果，已开始摸着群众路线的方法去完成为兵服务的光荣任务。
