(This report from Taiyue, 5th) The Hewa Village Cooperative in the Fifth District of Jincheng has been recognized as a model for farmer cooperatives. The Hewa Cooperative was organized last winter in November by the deputy village head Ning Pingzhi and two others. At that time, it was an empty shell without any capital. The business it engaged in was not selling consumer goods such as oil, salt, soy sauce, and vinegar, but first helping the masses by securing porterage and organizing transportation. The first time, it contracted to transport 1,500 catties of timber for a factory in Chengguan. In addition to the cooperative receiving a handling fee of two yuan per catty, the masses earned a porterage fee of eight yuan per catty. People were drawn in rotation from mutual aid groups in ten natural villages, totaling seventy people. Within ten days, they earned a total of 120,000 yuan. Each person earned 1,700 yuan. In February this spring, they contracted to transport 30,000 catties of wood. Forty people participated in the transportation each day. When returning, they brought back Henan goods from the mountains. The porterage fee was still eight yuan per catty per day. They earned 10,000 yuan for each round trip. Within ten days, they earned another 4,800,000 yuan. In March, they also transported raw materials from Xinhua Paper Mill to the city, earning a total of 138,000 yuan. In three times, they earned a total of 7,380,000 yuan, with an average of more than 10,500 yuan earned per person. Subsequently, the cooperative mobilized the masses to raise 240,000 yuan. In addition to continuing to organize transportation, it also organized a blacksmith shop, solving the problem of agricultural tools in the village, and also promoted them to most villages in the Fourth and Eighth Districts. The carpentry shop manufactured spinning wheels and looms, developing the village's textile industry. A blacksmith's daily wage was 450 yuan, and a carpenter's was 300 yuan, while the cooperative staff had no wages, and each person only had half a catty of soybean flour and seven he of rice for food. From February to April, a major accounting was done, with a total gross profit of 430,000 yuan. After deducting food and textile funds, the net profit was 330,000 yuan. The masses' shares of 240,000 yuan were distributed as dividends of 240,000 yuan. The remaining 90,000 yuan was distributed among the four cooperative staff members, who shared 40,000 yuan. The blacksmiths and carpenters received a bonus of 20,000 yuan. Finally, 30,000 yuan was used to provide preferential treatment to the village's thirty-one military families. The textile work was also developed under the support of the cooperative. When the spinning began, there were not many spinners. To motivate everyone, the cooperative sold thread and bought cotton for the spinners, without giving them a single cent. After the machines were made in February, more than ten women from each natural village were selected and asked a teacher to study for a month in the temple, and then dispersed back to each natural village to develop textiles. The cooperative tried its best to solve the difficulties of textile workers. Until now, out of 190 households in the village, 95 spinning wheels and 18 looms have been developed, with an average of one spinning wheel per household and one loom per ten households. In the first three months, textiles earned 222,000 yuan. Therefore, at the district's semi-annual production summary meeting on July 13, the cooperative was recognized as a "farmer cooperative" that truly served the farmers.

　　晋城贺洼村组织运输
  　没股金开办了合作社
    【本报太岳五日电】晋城五区贺洼村合作社，已被公认为农民合作社的典型。贺洼合作社，在去冬十一月由副村长宁平智等三人组织起来，当时是没有一个本钱的空架子，所经营的业务，不是卖油盐酱醋等消费品，而是首先替群众揽脚，组织运输。开始第一次就给城关××工厂承揽运输木材达一五零零斤，合作社除每斤得两元手续费外，群众运输每斤得脚价八元，从十个自然村的互助组里，抽人轮流运输，共计七十人，十天内共赚到脚价洋十二万元。每人即可赚到一千七百元。今春二月，又一次承揽运木料三万斤，每天有四十人参加运输，返回时捎下山的河南脚货，每斤每天脚价还是八元，来回脚可赚到一万元，十天内又赚洋四百八十万元。三月里又给新华纸厂收购原料运往城里，共赚洋十三万八千元，前后三次，共赚洋七十三万八千元，每人平均赚洋一万零五百余元。随后，合作社便动员群众集股二十四万元，除一面继续组织运输外，另一面组织铁匠铺，解决了本村农具困难，同时还推销到四、八区大部村庄。木作铺制造纺车织机，开展村中纺织事业。一个铁匠，每天工资四百五十元，木匠每天三百元，而合作社职员没工资，每人每天只有半斤豆面，七合米的伙食供给。从二月至四月，大算帐一次，共赚毛利四十三万元，除伙食纺织基金外，赚净利三十三万元。群众股金二十四万元，共分红利二十四万元，下余九万元，经群众决定合作社四个职员共分红四万元，铁木匠提奖二万元，最后三万元，优待了全村三十一家军属。纺织工作也在合作社扶植下开展起来，当开始动手纺织时，纺妇不多，为推动大家，合作社给纺妇卖线买棉花，不给她们分文。到二月机子做成后，挑选各自然村妇女十余人，请老师在庙上学了一个月，然后又分散回各自然村发展纺织，合作社尽量解决纺织工的困难，直至现在，全村一百九十户，已发展到纺车九十五架，织机十八架，每户平均有纺车一辆，每十户有织机一架。第一期三个月，纺织赚到二十二万二千元，因此，在七月十三日全区半年生产总结会议中，该社被公认真正为农民服务的“农民合作社”。
