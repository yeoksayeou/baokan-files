　　Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 3rd: After the annihilation of Chiang Kai-shek's 36th Division, the Chiang Kai-shek forces on the southern front of northern Shaanxi are extremely depleted. The entire territory of Gulin, about 80 kilometers southeast of Yan'an, is now free of enemy presence. Yanchuan and Yanchang each have only one battalion of Chiang Kai-shek troops, besieged by the active local guerrillas. The broad rural areas ten miles outside the city are experiencing orderly democratic governance, stable prices, and the masses are producing as usual. The Chiang Kai-shek troops entrenched in the isolated city of Yanchang have had to rely on supplies from Yan'an for food. The Chiang Kai-shek troops delivering grain try every possible means to avoid the main roads and detour through Yanchuan, escorted by a company of soldiers each from Yanchang and Yanchuan. However, they still cannot escape serving as a transportation team for the guerrillas. In the vicinity of Hougou, Jiaokou Town alone, the guerrillas successively seized 30 bags of foreign flour and 25 mules. Farmers plowing the fields also seized a batch of foreign flour and 30 sets of military uniforms, and captured two straggling Chiang Kai-shek soldiers alive. During the period when the Chiang Kai-shek troops were besieged and starving in Gulin, the people were particularly skilled at strengthening the walls and hiding grain. The entire county only lost more than two shi of public grain. According to incomplete statistics, in 67 battles, the guerrillas in the three counties have killed and wounded 162 Chiang Kai-shek soldiers, captured 88 alive, and arrested 78 Chiang Kai-shek special agents.

  　我游击队活跃农村秩序井然
    【新华社西北三日电】蒋军三十六师被歼后，陕北南线蒋军兵力极为空虚，延安东南八十公里左右的固临，全境现已无敌踪。延川，延长仅各有蒋军一个营，并为当地活跃的游击队所围困，离城十里外的广大农村民主秩序井然，物价稳定，群众照常生产。困守孤城的延长蒋军，食粮已不得不依仗延安的接济。送粮的蒋军千方百计避开大路绕道延川，并由延长延川各派一连兵迎送，但仍然逃不脱充当游击队的运输队。仅在交口镇后沟附近，游击队即先后缴获洋面三十袋，骡子二十五头；锄地的农民也缴得一批洋面和三十套军衣，并活捉掉队的蒋军两名。固临在困饿蒋军时期，坚壁藏粮特别技巧，全县公粮只损失两石多。据不完全统计，三县游击队在先后六十七次战斗中，已毙伤蒋军一百六十二名，生俘八十八名，捕获蒋介石特务七十八名。
