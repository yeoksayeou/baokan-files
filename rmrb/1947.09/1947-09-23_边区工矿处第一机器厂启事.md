Border Region Industry and Mining Department
    First Machine Factory Notice
    Our factory undertakes the manufacturing of spare parts and complete machines for factories and mines in the Liberated Areas, and has an attached electrical department specializing in the installation of various motors. We have specially hired a skilled master knife-maker from other areas to make various types of chisels. We strive for low prices on orders and guarantee on-time completion.

    Recently, our factory has produced new-style drilling rigs and a large number of machine parts, including vise grips, large and small taps, threading dies, etc. We have also newly repaired several large and small horsepower machines. All goods are of excellent quality, sturdy and durable, and sold at low cost and reduced prices. If you would like to patronize us, please come to the cooperative in Xiazhuang Village, Ninth District, Wu'an to negotiate.
