    Hot East Annihilation Bandit First Division
    Captures Bandit Division Commander, Eliminates 4,300 Enemies
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northeast Front, 20th] A unit of the Ji-Cha-Re-Liao People's Liberation Army completely annihilated the entire (minus one regiment) of the Kuomintang bandit 93rd Army (Division) Provisional 22nd Division (Brigade), routed the bandit Provisional 50th Division, and captured the bandit Provisional 32nd Division Commander Su Jingtai, eliminating more than 4,300 enemies. Since the bandit chieftain Chen Cheng took charge of the Kuomintang bandit Northeast operations, he urgently sought to consolidate the security of the flanks of the Beining Railway line in order to cope with the People's Liberation Army's offensive. On the 6th, he dispatched two divisions to advance towards Lingyuan (i.e., Jianchang) in the Hot East from Jinzhou and Suizhong. The enemy 93rd Army Provisional 22nd Division (minus one regiment) and division direct units, which attacked from Jinzhou, advanced to Xintai Gate, 70 li southwest of Jinxi. On the 18th at 13:00, the People's Liberation Army launched a counterattack. In just three hours of fighting, the enemy was mostly annihilated. Preliminary battle results show: captured the bandit Provisional 22nd Division Commander Su Jingtai and other officers and soldiers totaling more than 2,500, killed and wounded more than 800 enemy officers and soldiers, and seized 6 mountain guns, 1 anti-aircraft gun, more than 100 light and heavy machine guns, more than 1,000 rifles, and many other munitions and supplies. The enemy Provisional 50th Division (reorganized from the Northeast Security First District troops), consisting of more than 3,000 men, which attacked from Suizhong, advanced to the mountainous area north of Lishugou, 100 li northwest of Suizhong, and was completely routed by the People's Liberation Army on the night of the 15th. More than 400 enemies were killed and wounded, and more than 600 were captured. The remnants fled in panic towards Suizhong. Note: The 93rd Army was formerly the old troops of Long Yun of the Yunnan Army. Its Provisional 21st Division was annihilated by us in Northeast in May of this year.
