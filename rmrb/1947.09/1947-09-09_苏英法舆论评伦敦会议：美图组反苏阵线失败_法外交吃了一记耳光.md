Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd: Combined reports: Soviet, British, and French public opinion believes that the fruitless adjournment of the London Conference, where the US, Britain, and France discussed the level of German industry, not only means that the US's diplomatic attempt to form a trilateral anti-Soviet front before the November London Four Foreign Ministers Conference suffered a defeat, but also gave Bidault's French diplomacy, which everywhere caters to US policy, "a slap in the face" (according to a Reuters correspondent in Paris). The Pravda stated that the communiqué from the London Conference shows that the organizers of the conference were unable to form a united front to deal with the future Four Foreign Ministers Conference. It also stated that the experience of the conference shows that "the path of arbitrariness and illegality is not as convenient and easy as some leaders in the US and Britain think," and that "issuing a communiqué is clearly just to cover up the undeniable failure of the London Conference." The British Manchester Guardian stated that the US and British plan for German industry is related to France's security and its demand for prioritized recovery. However, France's "demands for some guarantees were not given at all by this conference." Most Paris newspapers, when mentioning the communiqué of this conference, are full of indignation. L'Humanité stated: "The United States does not pay attention to France's opinions." The Tribune stated: "People should not look at the Anglo-American plan to raise the level of German industry from the text; it is trying to allow American capital to invade Germany and operate as it does in its own country, and obtain the best 'industrial bridgehead'." Even the Figaro, the newspaper of de Gaulle's faction, who is the US's agent in France, could not help but sigh with disillusionment: The conference communiqué "makes the French once again consider that the fruits of common victory have fallen into the hands of the defeated enemy…".

　　苏英法舆论评伦敦会议：
    美图组反苏阵线失败
    法外交吃了一记耳光
    【新华社陕北三日电】联合报导：苏联与英、法的舆论认为：美、英、法三国讨论德国工业水平的伦敦会议之无结果而散，不仅是美国在十一月间伦敦四外长会前组成三国反苏阵线之外交企图遭受失败，而且是给了处处以迎合美国政策的比道尔法国外交“一记耳光”（路透社巴黎记者语）。真理报称：伦敦会议的公报显示，该会的组织者并未能够组成对付未来四外长会议的统一战线。并称：该会议的经验说明“那种专横与不法行为的道路，并不象美、英某些首脑们所想的那么方便与容易”，“发布公报显然只是为了掩饰伦敦会议无可怀疑的失败”。英国曼彻斯特卫报称：美、英的德国工业计划，关系着法国的安全及它的优先恢复的要求。但法国“要求的一些保证，这一会议完全没有给予。”大多数巴黎报纸提到这一会议的公报时，则皆充满愤慨。人道报称：“美国并不注意法国的意见。”特伦德报称：“人们不要从条文中来看英美提高德国工业水平的计划，它力使美国资本侵入德国，正如在它本国一样来进行活动，并获得最优良的“工业桥头。”甚至象美国在法国的代理人戴高乐派费加洛报亦不能不抱着幻灭的感叹息道：会议公报“使法国人要再一次考虑共同胜利的果实是到了失败的敌人手里……”。
