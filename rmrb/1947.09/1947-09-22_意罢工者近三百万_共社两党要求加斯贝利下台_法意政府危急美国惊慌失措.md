Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, September 19th: The Italian general strike movement continues to develop rapidly. According to an Associated Press dispatch from Rome: As of the 16th, the number of Italian workers protesting against soaring prices and demanding wage increases has exceeded two million. According to a TASS dispatch from Rome: Another 810,000 national steelworkers joined on the 18th, further escalating the strike movement. On the same day, 100,000 people participated in a rally in Milan, and 70,000 people participated in a rally in Turin. Large-scale rallies were also held in Genoa, Florence, and Naples. Due to the unity of the Italian working class, all Italian steelworkers without exception stopped work on the same day, responding to the union's call for a 48-hour strike, maintaining order. The leadership of the steelworkers' union announced that if the factories remained stubborn after this strike, the workers would implement a "non-cooperation policy" within the factories and reserve the freedom for further action. At the same time, the strike of 1.6 million agricultural workers in northern Italy continues, reaching nine days as of the 18th. The strike of workers in the national cement industry in Italy has lasted eight days, and the strike of forest rangers has reached the tenth day. A large-scale strike by textile workers is brewing. According to an Associated Press dispatch, the Italian Communist Party spokesman, Longo, publicly demanded De Gasperi's resignation on the 18th. Longo stated that the purpose of the national demonstration on the 20th was to denounce the De Gasperi cabinet. He also stated that many facts prove that the Communist Party and the Socialist Party are the most authoritative and sincere representatives of the vast working masses of Italy. Prior to this, according to a United Press dispatch, Italian Socialist Party leader Nenni urged De Gasperi to step down voluntarily on the 10th, otherwise, "it will inevitably be overthrown by the irresistible forces of popular opposition."

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, September 19th: Washington News: The large-scale strike struggles of the working classes in France and Italy against the economic policies of their governments have caused extreme fear to American imperialism, which is attempting to enslave the peoples of France and Italy through the French and Italian authorities. According to a United Press dispatch on the 15th, a senior U.S. official has called on Marshall to request Truman to convene a special session of Congress in early November to discuss the situation in Western Europe. The official stated: "According to reports from U.S. diplomatic personnel stationed in France and Italy, the sentiments of the peoples of France and Italy are intense, and they deeply fear that American aid will not arrive in time to support the current governments of France and Italy." He also stated: "The U.S. Department of Defense has agreed with Marshall's view that the collapse of the current governments of France and Italy will lead to the following results: (1) the disruption of the balance of power in the Mediterranean, seriously affecting the situation in Greece; (2) the disruption of the balance of power in Central Europe, causing the countries surrounding the U.S. occupation forces in Germany to be ruled by governments unfriendly to the United States; (3) the enhancement of the 'agitation' of left-wing elements in Britain." The official trembled and expressed: "Next week (September 23rd to 27th) will be the key to the world, the key to whether Western Europe can obtain American aid and whether the balance of power in Western Europe can be maintained." At the same time, U.S. officials and their news agencies have spread rumors, saying that "the Communist Party is inciting" and "overthrowing the government," attempting to release this anti-communist smokescreen as a pretext for further interference in the internal affairs of France and Italy.
