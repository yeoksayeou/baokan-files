　　Promote Democracy, Consolidate Mutual Aid
  　Justice Over Selfishness, Frankness Breaks Sentimentality
    [Special dispatch from our reporters on the 3rd] Our reporters separately investigated many very consolidated and collapsed mutual aid teams, and found that democracy, voluntarism, and equivalence are the three key factors in running a good mutual aid team. When farmers are working together in production, it is inevitable that there will be some small disagreements or conflicts of interest. At first, they are unwilling to bring them up due to sentimentality, and slowly they will say behind their backs: "This won't do! Let's break up next year!" When it comes to urgent moments such as seizing the time to plant seeds and weed seedlings (when seizing the time, being half a day late may mean no seedlings will emerge; the first weeding, being one or two days early, has a great impact on the harvest), the stakes are most prominent, and opinions suddenly erupt. Many mutual aid teams often collapse when they are busiest, and that is the reason. Some mutual aid teams have established a criticism system, holding regular meetings and advocating "If you have an opinion, say it, and everyone will judge it." These methods are to make the mutual aid team more consolidated and to prevent any opinions from being held back at ordinary times. When seizing the time and weeding, the team leader leads the team members to the field to observe, and everyone judges which plot of land should be planted and weeded first, and which can be slightly delayed. The majority decides, and those who disagree are persuaded and convinced based on facts with the collective strength. As it becomes commonplace, "justice" can overcome "selfishness", and "frankness" can break "sentimentality". To promote democracy well, the team leader must be selfless, upright, and resourceful, on the one hand, he can set an example for others with his own correct actions; on the other hand, when farmers raise opinions and argue indecisively, he can gather the correct ones, lead and assist the majority, and persuade those who are incorrect.

　　发扬民主巩固互助
  　公道胜自私直率破情面
    【本报记者团三日电】记者分别调查许多非常巩固和垮了台的互助组，发现民主、自愿与等价，同为搞好互助组的三大关键。农民们在一起生产，难免因意见不和或利益突冲闹些小蹩扭，最初还碍于情面不愿提出，慢慢的就在背后说二话：“这还成！明年散伙吧！”一到抢晌下种锄苗等紧急关头（抢晌时，晚一半天就许不能出苗，第一次锄苗，早一两天，对收成关系很大），利害表现最突出，意见即突然爆发出来，许多互助组常常在活最忙的时候垮台，就是这个原故。有些互助组建立了批评制度，定期开会，提倡“有意见就说，说了大家评判。”这些办法，是为的互助组更加巩固，使平时不存任何意见。在抢晌、锄苗时，组长带领组员到地里观察，由大家判断，那块地该应先种先锄，那块可以略缓，多数决定，个别不同意者，即用集体力量，根据事实规劝说服，习以为常，“公道”可战胜“自私”，“直率”能打破“情面”。要很好发扬民主，组长必须大公无私、正派、有办法，一方面能为自己的正确行动示范于人；一方面能在农民纷纷提意见争执不决时，把正确的集中起来，领导与协助多数，说服不正确者。（李庄）
