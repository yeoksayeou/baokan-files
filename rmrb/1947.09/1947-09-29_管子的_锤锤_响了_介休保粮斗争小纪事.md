Guanzi's "Hammer" Sounds
    A Small Chronicle of the Grain Protection Struggle in Jiexiu
    Jiali

The wheat had just been harvested, and it was time to weed the autumn seedlings for the second time! Recently, in Donghulong Village, a border area of Jiexiu, the "Oil Mill Managers" (referring to personnel of the Yan puppet regime) came here every two or three days to plunder grain. Several gleaming guillotines were placed in the village office, "If you don't give grain, you give your life!"

On the morning of July 11th, Guanzi learned that the thugs were coming. So, with a "hammer" (nickname for a hand grenade) tucked into his waist and a hoe on his shoulder, he hummed a little tune and swaggered to his field in the west of the village to weed the autumn seedlings.

Just after breakfast, "Bang!" a shot rang out, signaling to the people, "The Oil Mill Managers are here again to extract oil and scrape the land!"

At this time, Guanzi had already arrived in the field. He took the hand grenade from his waist and gently threw it onto the soft soil he had hoed.

Before a pipe of tobacco could be smoked, the villagers, men, women, old and young, were running wildly in all directions of the field, followed by groups of three or five "Oil Mill Managers" wielding "crying sticks" (referring to guns).

At first, Guanzi also planned to hide further away, but later he changed his mind. He thought, "Damn their ancestors, still running to 'Qiu Niu Country'? The wheat will be lost! If they come, I'll fight them, anyway, we can't survive without fighting." After wiping away his sweat, he lowered his head and kept his eyes fixed on his "hammer" under his feet.

The weather was terribly hot. The July sun beat down directly on the earth, and working in the chest-high sorghum field was particularly sultry.

Guanzi kept his head down and hoed with all his might.

"Thump! Thump!" A burst of footsteps passed by, and the sorghum leaves swayed violently. Just as Guanzi raised his head, three "Oil Mill Managers," with guns slung over their backs, appeared at the edge of the field. One of them had already stepped into the middle of the field, and it looked like he was going to slap Guanzi first before saying anything else. But before the other party could make a move, Guanzi's hoe had already flown over. With a "crack" sound, the Oil Mill Manager took the hit on his head and fell to the ground with his gun. Guanzi took advantage of the situation to squat down and grab his "hammer." When the other two thugs pounced on him, Guanzi became anxious. He raised the hand grenade with his left hand, bent his body, and pulled the fuse with his right hand. With a loud bang, the two who had pounced over also went back to their old home together.

    管子的“锤锤”响了
    介休保粮斗争小纪事
    加里
    麦子刚割完，秋苗又得锄二遍草了！近来，在介休边沿区的东湖龙村，“油坊掌柜”们（指阎伪政权人员）三日两头来这里搜刮粮食。村公所摆着几口明晃晃铡刀，“不给粮，就给命！”
    七月十一号早上，管子打听得恶棍们就要来了，于是腰间蹩好“锤锤”（手榴弹昵称），肩膀扛起锄头，哼着小调，一摇一摆到村西头自己地里锄秋苗去了。
    刚吃罢早饭，“砰”地一枪，这是告诉人们，“油房掌柜们又来榨油、刮地上来了！”
    这时管子已到了地里，把手榴弹从腰间取下，轻轻扔到自己锄过的松软的土地上。
    没一袋烟工夫，村里男女老少往四面地里乱跑，后面跟踪而来的是三三五五持着“哭棒棒”（指枪）的“油坊掌柜”们。
    起先，管子也打算再往远处躲躲，后来不知怎么他改变了念头他想：“日他祖宗，还往‘球牛国’跑？麦子是丢光啦！来就和他干两下，反正不干就活不成。”抹一把汗后，他低下头，又眼盯住脚底下自己的那颗“锤锤”。
    天气热得要命，七月的阳光直射着大地，在漫过胸脯高的高粱林里做活，更是异常闷热。
    管子低着头，一股劲在锄着。
    “卜踏！卜踏！”一阵脚步声过去，高粱叶摆动得十分厉害；当管子正抬起头来，三个“油坊掌柜”已经大背着枪，出现在地头上，其中一个已向地当间迈进，看样子他一伸手，就要先打管子一巴掌，再说别的。可是没等对方举动，管子的锄头早飞将过去，只听得“叭擦”一声，油坊掌柜脑脑上着了家伙，连人带枪栽倒在地。管子乘势又圪蹴下抓起自己的那颗“锤锤”，当其余两个恶棍扑向他这边时，管子心一急，左手将手榴弹举起，身子一弯，右手早拉断了火线，轰隆一声，扑过来的两个，也一起滚回老家去了。
