Xinhua News Agency Comprehensive Report:

    Amidst the clamor of the Chiang bandit's obedience to the will of US imperialism in opening Sino-Japanese trade, the smuggling of Japanese goods has once again flooded the Chiang-controlled areas like a raging river, joining with the massive smuggling and dumping of American goods in delivering a fatal blow to national industry.

    Since the rampant smuggling of American goods began around August and September of last year, cheap smuggled American goods have occupied markets throughout the Chiang-controlled areas. However, at present, large quantities of smuggled Japanese goods have also appeared in Tianjin, Shanghai, Fuzhou, Guangzhou, and other places. Among these, seafood such as sea cucumber and shark fin, wool textiles, cigarettes, and rayon are the most common. There are also paints, paper, Western medicine, chemical products, electrical materials, rubber, tires, bicycle parts, fountain pens, and even children's toys—everything imaginable.

    As for the quantity of smuggled goods, according to official figures announced by the Director of the Chiang government's Information Bureau, Dong Xianguang, to reporters in August, the value of smuggled goods (mainly American goods) searched and confiscated last year alone reached 11.3 billion yuan (Chiang currency). According to a report in the Tianjin *Minguo Daily*, Japanese smuggled goods seized by Taiwan customs in the first half of this year alone were worth about 300 million Taiwan dollars, equivalent to more than 19 billion yuan in Chiang's legal tender. In reality, the above-mentioned figures of confiscated goods are only a drop in the ocean compared to the total value of all smuggled goods. For example, according to statistics announced by the Hong Kong authorities in August, at least 50,000 tons of goods (including American and Japanese goods) were smuggled into the Chiang-controlled areas via Hong Kong each month, and at least 100,000 tons in the single month of July.

    The current rampant smuggling of Japanese goods is as serious as in 1935. At that time, large-scale smuggling was limited to North China, but now the smuggling of Japanese goods is mainly based in southern Korea, which is controlled by US imperialism. Smuggled goods are directly transported to North China and transshipped to Central and South China via Taiwan, Hong Kong, and other places. The smuggling organization is very large and has strong armed protection. Customs anti-smuggling personnel are often shot at. Japanese smuggling ships have openly appeared in Chinese waters. In August, the Xiamen Customs discovered Japanese smuggling ships openly loading and unloading smuggled goods in the waters off Hui'an and Chongwu. High-speed Japanese "flying boats" have also been discovered along the coasts of Fujian and Zhejiang, carrying smuggled goods between Kyushu, Japan, and Fuzhou, China. The coasts of Guangdong, Xinhui, Qianmen, Zhongshan, Hengmen, Huiyang, Daya Bay, and the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway have all become important smuggling routes. Prohibited American goods are also frequently shipped from Guam, the Philippines, and Hong Kong to the Chinese coast.

    News from various sources proves that the large-scale resurgence of smuggling of American goods, especially Japanese goods, is the result of US imperialism supporting Japan's aggression against China and Chiang Kai-shek betraying the motherland. In order to obtain US imperialist aid for his civil war, Chiang Kai-shek does not hesitate to sell out coastal, inland river, and airspace sovereignty. US warships and aircraft are thus able to freely enter Chinese territorial waters, inland rivers, and land at Chinese airports, opening the door wide for the unhindered transport of smuggled goods. This point is something that even US imperialists cannot publicly deny. According to a Central News Agency dispatch from Qingdao on the 12th, US Marines engaged in medical smuggling have been exposed in Tianjin. Admiral Kirk, Commander of the US Navy's Western Pacific Fleet, had to admit that the case was related to US Marine Corps officers. According to two dispatches from Honolulu by the same agency at the beginning of this month, a US Navy fleet spokesman and Rear Admiral Pennell, commander of the US Navy in the Mariana Islands, both stated that they had discovered a large-scale smuggling organization of US naval and air force officers flying prohibited goods between Guam and the Chinese coast, with conclusive evidence. They also claimed to have seized a large batch of smuggled goods worth a considerable sum in mid-August. The rampant smuggling of Japanese goods is, in fact, part of US imperialism's policy of supporting Japan's aggression against China. US imperialism is massively exporting capital to Japan, investing in various industrial sectors in Japan, to support the resurgence of Japan's economic aggression. Therefore, the large-scale smuggling and dumping of Japanese goods in China is, in essence, a manifestation of US monopoly capital exploiting China through Japan's cheap labor. Shanghai *Xinmin Bao* reported at the end of last month that smuggled Japanese goods such as toys and wool textiles, which are being dumped in the Tianjin market, are labeled with "Made in America" trademarks and sold as American goods.

    The traitor Chiang Kai-shek not only refuses to protest and stop the large-scale smuggling of Japanese and American goods, but also intensifies the suppression of the Chinese people's righteous resistance against US imperialism. Liang Renda, an employee of a Shanghai department store, was brutally murdered by Chiang's bandit secret agents in February of this year for promoting the "Love National Products" movement. The Chiang bandit's Four Big Families and their servants, who are only interested in profit, are also colluding with US imperialists and Japanese bandits to engage in large-scale smuggling business, acting as pawns of US economic aggression against China. According to a Central News Agency dispatch from Shanghai on the 7th, the China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC), co-founded by Soong Mei-ling and businessman Yang Ge, frequently uses airplanes for smuggling. The "Qimei" freighter, seized by the Jianghai Customs on July 27 while carrying 1.5 billion yuan worth of luxury goods, also belonged to the Chiang family's private China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. Even the Kuomintang's news agency, in an editorial broadcast on August 26, could not help but vaguely acknowledge: "Those engaged in such illegal activities are not only unscrupulous merchants and scoundrels, but also unprincipled people and corrupt officials, colluding and acting in collusion with each other. Reports state that the smuggling in Hong Kong and Guangdong is backed by so-and-so, with a background of so-and-so and so-and-so, which shows that smuggling in South China has become an unimaginable situation."

### 蒋贼勾结美帝日寇  大干走私生意助美经济侵华  新华社综合报导

    蒋贼勾结美帝日寇
    大干走私生意助美经济侵华
    新华社综合报导
    在蒋贼服从美帝国主义意旨开放中日贸易声中，走私日货又以若决江河之势泛滥蒋管区，与美国货之大量走私及倾销，双管齐下，予民族工业以致命打击。
    从去年八、九月间美货走私猖獗以来，廉价走私美货即占领蒋管区各地市场，但目前天津、上海、福州、广州等各地，又出现了大量的走私日货，其中以海参鱼翅等海味、毛织品、香烟及人造丝为最多，还有颜料、纸、西药、化学制品、电料、橡皮、车胎、自行车零件、自来水笔，甚至儿童玩具等，应有尽有。
    至于走私货的数量，据蒋政府新闻局长董显光于八月间向记者宣布的官方数字，去年一年仅搜查获没收的私货（主要为美货），其价值即达一百一十三亿元（蒋币）；另据天津民国日报报导：今年上半年仅台湾海关所缉获的日本私货就值台币三亿元左右，约合蒋家法币一百九十亿余元。实际上，上述被缉获的数字只不过是全部走私货物总值的九牛一毛而已。例如据香港当局八月间宣布的统计：每月单是经由香港私运蒋管区的货物（包括美货、日货）至少有五万吨，七月份一个月中最低限度就有十万吨之多。
    目前日货走私猖獗，其严重性已不亚于一九三五年。当时大规模的走私仅限于华北，现在的日货走私却是以美帝国主义控制的朝鲜南部为主要基地，走私货直接运至华北及经由台湾、香港等地转至华中华南。走私的组织甚为庞大，并有强大武装掩护，海关缉私人员常被射击。从事走私的日本轮船已公开在中国海面出现，八月间厦门海关即曾发现走私日轮公然在惠安、崇武海面起卸走私货物。闽浙沿海也已发现高速度日本“飞小艇”载运私货往来于日本九州与中国福州之间。广东沿海新会、前门、中山、横门、惠阳、大亚湾以及广九铁路，均成为重要的走私之道。而违禁美货也经常由关岛、菲律宾及香港运至中国海岸。
    各方消息证明，目前美货特别是日货大规模走私之所以卷土重来，乃是美帝国主义扶助日本侵略中国及蒋介石出卖祖国的结果。蒋介石为获取美帝对其内战的援助，不惜出卖沿海、内河以及领空主权，美舰与美机遂得自由驶入中国领海、内河及在中国机场降落，门户洞开，私货因而畅运无阻，此点即美帝国主义者亦不得不公然承认。据中央社青岛十二日电透露：美海军陆战队从事医药走私已在天津被破获，美海军西太平洋舰队总司令柯克上将也不得不承认此案与美海军陆战队军官有关。另据该社本月初旬发自檀香山的两次电讯，美海军舰队发言人与马里亚纳美海军司令潘纳尔少将均表示：已发现有美海空军军官大规模的走私组织，在关岛与中国海岸之间飞运违禁品，证据确切，并称于八月中旬曾破获一批价值颇巨之私货。至日货走私之猖獗，实为美帝国主义扶植日本侵略中国政策的一部分。美帝国主义正大量对日输出资本，投资于日本的各工业部门，以扶助日本经济侵略力量再起。因此日货大量走私倾销中国，实质上即是美国垄断资本通过日本的廉价劳动榨取中国之表现。上海新民报上月底报导，在天津市面倾销的玩具，毛织品等走私日货，都标有“美国制造”的商标当作美货出卖。
    卖国贼蒋介石对大规模的日美货走私，不但不愿提出抗议加以制止，反而加紧镇压中国人民对美帝国主义的正义反抗，今年二月间上海百货业职工梁仁达君即因提倡爱用国货运动，而横遭蒋匪特务惨杀。惟利是图的蒋匪四大家族及其臣仆们且复勾结美帝日寇大干走私生意。充当美帝经济侵略中国的虎口。据中央社上海七日电透露：宋美龄与商人杨格等合办的中航公司经常以飞机经营走私。七月二十七日被江海关缉获的载运十五亿元奢侈品的“其美号”，也是蒋家私人的招商局的轮船。连国民党通讯社于八月二十六日广播的党报社论中也不能不含糊其词地承认：“从事此种不法行为者，不仅为奸商莠民，更有不肖之事人，与不法之官吏，相互勾结狼狈为奸。报载港粤走私有某某等帮，由某国及某某等为背景等语，足见华南走私已成为一种不堪设想之局面。”
