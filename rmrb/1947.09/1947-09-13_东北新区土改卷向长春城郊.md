Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 9th: Land Reform Dynamics in the Northeast Border Areas: (1) Shuangyang County, facing Changchun, after being liberated in May this year, launched a widespread land reform movement. One village ignited the flames, and all villages followed suit. The peasants of Yimian Mountain took the lead in liquidating Shi Shaochun, the Kuomintang security captain, puppet Manchukuo village chief, and local tyrant, recovering more than 800 *qing* of land. Subsequently, peasants in Zigou, Dudahe, Shangxiabaiquan and other places also rose up and carried out land distribution. In less than twenty days, they distributed more than 1,000 *qing* of fertile land. The landlords' quick-firing guns and foreign cannons were confiscated, and peasant self-defense forces were formed to resist Chiang. The storm of the people's liberation in the new area is now sweeping towards the suburbs of Changchun along the Shuangyang-Changchun road. (2) Under the experience of Chiang Kai-shek's tyrannical rule in the past year, the masses in Panshi County, Jilin South New Area, have begun to break the "orthodox concept" and the "fear of change" mentality. The masses in Xujiatangzi automatically went to the work team on the evening of their arrival, asking for support, and the next day they detained the objects of struggle. The masses in Liuyang Village, upon hearing news of land distribution in other villages, also spontaneously organized peasant associations and sealed up the property of landlords. In Dongfu District of the county, after the local armed forces eliminated the bandits in the National Grand Courtyard, they overthrew the landlords and local bullies in twenty villages within four administrative villages of the courtyard in one week. The peasants recovered more than 3,000 *qing* of land and 100 million yuan in floating wealth. The basic masses have now taken control of the peasant associations and self-defense force armaments. (3) In Fuyu County, across the river from Kuomintang-occupied Nong'an, more than 600 peasants in the Wujia Station area automatically arrested Ma Zongshan, a standing committee member of the puppet Concordia Association who colluded with Chiang's special agents to persecute the people. They also arrested and executed Wu Yongsheng, a three-generation bandit and Central Beard who murdered Liu Zhen, deputy secretary of the CCP District Committee of the area, and Guo Qi, a cadre of the District All-Circles United Association. The remaining feudal enemy and puppet forces have now been largely defeated. The masses in seventeen villages in the district have distributed more than 5,000 *qing* of land and 250 million yuan in floating property. To commemorate the leaders who gloriously sacrificed themselves for leading them to liberation, the local peasants specially renamed Liujiazi Township as Liuzhen Township and Zhujiadian Township as Guoqi Township.
