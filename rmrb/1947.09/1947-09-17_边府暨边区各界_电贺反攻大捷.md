Xinhua News Agency, Jinji Luyu, 14th. The Jinji Luyu Border Region Government, Chairman Yang and Vice Chairman Rong, sent a telegram to congratulate Generals Liu, Deng, Chen, Xie and others for the great victory in the counter-offensive. The original telegram is as follows: Generals Liu Bocheng, Deng Xiaoping, Xu Xiangqian, Li Xiannian, Chen Geng, Xie Fuzhi, Han Jun, Kong Congzhou, Qin Jiwei and all the commanders and fighters on the front line: Our army, with its invincible power, launched a southward attack. The Liu-Deng army went straight to the Dabie Mountains area, shaking the north and south of the Yangtze River. The Chen-Xie army crossed the Yellow River to the south, liberating the vast areas south of Longhai, west of Pinghan, and north of Hanshui. Wherever the mighty army went, the enemy and puppets were defeated. Millions of compatriots in the Jiang-controlled area once again saw the light of day, laying the foundation for the victory of the entire strategic counter-offensive. The good news came and the people were excited, and they took it as supreme glory that the counter-offensive army set out from the border region. Now the 30 million people in the border region are deeply engaged in land reform, increasing production, practicing strict economy, and mobilizing a large number of cadres to go to the front line to support the front line with all their strength. We hope that we will continue our efforts to completely eliminate the Chiang bandits, overthrow Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous and dictatorial rule, and plant the banner of liberation all over China.
    Xinhua News Agency, Jinji Luyu, 15th. The news of the People's Liberation Army's large-scale counter-offensive spread, and the people were delighted. Congratulatory telegrams from all parties here flew in. The telegram from the Jinlu Yu District Party Committee, Military Region, and Administrative Office stated: "The good news of the strategic counter-offensive has made the people of the entire district excited. Over the past year, our district's military and civilians have worked hard to repair dikes and control rivers, launched guerrilla warfare, implemented land reform, and implemented production mutual assistance, and have achieved great results. In the future, we should carry forward the spirit of hard struggle in the past, extensively develop internal annihilation warfare, directly cooperate with the counter-offensive army in combat, so as to completely annihilate the bandit army inside and outside the liberated area, and at the same time step up production, thoroughly re-examine and support the front line, and ensure a steady stream of supplies." The telegram from the Taihang District Party Committee stated: "The counter-offensive army, in the upper and lower ten days of August, forcibly crossed the natural danger of the Yellow River, marched into the Dabie Mountain area and western Henan after Jiang, and swept away 27 cities of the Chiang bandits in total. The liberated people of Taihang were overjoyed when they heard the news and told each other: 'The old roots of feudalism are about to fall!' We only represent the six million people of Taihang to pay tribute to you, congratulate you on your great victory, and congratulate the fathers and elders of the Central Plains on regaining their liberation. And we vow to be your backing." The Taiyue District Party Committee, Military Region, and Administrative Office sent a telegram to the Chen, Xie, Han, Kong, and Qin armies, saying: "You have spanned the Yellow River on a front of hundreds of miles, successively conquered five cities, cut off Longhai, and the bandits and stubborns were defeated. The vast number of people in western Henan have seen the light of day again, and the guerrilla warfare of our district's people has also developed more and more. In the past ten days, we have successively recovered Yishi and other three cities, and cleared out the remaining bandits in the Ji (Yuan) Meng (County) area. In the future, we will lead the four million people to work harder and vow to be your backing." The Taiyue Military Commission General Association, in addition to sending a telegram to congratulate all the commanders and fighters of the Chen-Xie army, also sent a telegram to congratulate the militiamen of the Taiyue expeditionary force, saying: "You followed our counter-offensive army on the southern expedition and fought side by side with the troops, and your battle achievements are brilliant. This is your glory and also the glory of the Taiyue area." The joint congratulatory telegram from the Jinlu Yu Daily, Xinhua Branch, and Jinlu Yu Federation of Literary and Art Circles stated: "The good news calls on us to support the front line with all our strength. Cadres of various agencies are stepping up their work to adapt to the new requirements and will publish a large number of cultural food to supply the counter-offensive army."
