    Taihang Second Special District
    Instructs on Repairing Bridges and Roads to Facilitate Frontline Support and Autumn Harvest
    [This newspaper, Taihang] To facilitate support for the front lines and develop the transportation industry, the Second Special District Office instructed all counties under its jurisdiction to start repairing roads and bridges as soon as possible. The instruction stated: "Now that the rainy season has passed and the autumn harvest is approaching, repairing bridges and roads early this year is even more significant for facilitating support for the front lines, developing transportation, connecting material exchanges between inland and outside areas, organizing surplus labor to develop diversified production to overcome disasters, and laying the foundation for winter production and construction." It continued: "Leaders must be good at integrating with the masses' existing habits, so that actions proceed from spontaneous to planned and organized." The instruction specifically pointed out: "1. All localities should formulate comprehensive plans for repairing bridges and roads or constructing major roads based on actual conditions, and carry out the construction in an organized manner. 2. All major and minor roads, wooden and stone bridges, should be repaired to be smooth (especially cart roads). 3. Restore the original bridges, prepare wood and stone as soon as possible, and strive to erect them as soon as possible." Finally, it proposed: "The implementation situation in various places should be checked regularly." (Pi Yu, You Ye)
    [Also reported] The Pingding Economic Committee has decided to open up major roads from Pingding to Zanhuang and Yuanshi, and from Pingding to Jingxing, Xiyang, and Zanhuang, to organize the large-scale sale of coal from Pingding to Jing, Zan, Yuan, and Gao (yi) and other places. The construction of this highway is planned to be carried out jointly with relevant counties in the First Special District. The various specific issues of starting construction are currently being discussed and it is expected that construction will begin soon. After the completion of this road, it will solve the fuel problem for various counties, solve the labor problem for disaster victims in Pingding, and ensure that coal has a market and workers will not have to seek other jobs. The major road between Xiyang and Zanhuang is also being actively discussed for construction. (Pi Yu, You Ye)
    [This newspaper, Taiyue, 24th dispatch] Gaoping is currently repairing roads, accumulating fertilizer, and preparing for wheat planting and the autumn harvest. First of all, in Wangcun, in addition to plowing the wheat fields three times, they are also stepping up fertilizer production due to insufficient manure and soil for the expanded wheat fields. They brought in seven flocks of sheep at a time to lie on the ground, covering a total of 69 mu of wheat fields. When it rained and they could not enter the fields, they trampled manure in the pens and applied it to 20 mu of wheat fields. Secondly, the masses in various villages are actively pooling shares to purchase livestock. The masses in Xiatai Village, Fifth District, have freely combined in groups of three to five households and have already purchased nine head of oxen. Shuangjing Village in the Fourth District has taken all the money earned by the textile factory and nitre workshop cooperative to allow the masses to buy livestock, increasing the number of livestock in the village from 25 to 33. In addition, in order to facilitate the autumn harvest, wheat planting, and manure delivery, various villages are rushing to repair cart roads. For example, Mishan Village in the First District mobilized more than 500 people during the overcast and rainy days, divided them into groups to repair roads, and launched a competition with the conditions of being flat, easy to walk, and passable for vehicles. In just over two days, they repaired 28 roads that could be passed by large carts. Shimocun Village in the Fourth District also mobilized 130 women, cooperating with some men, on the 2nd of last month, and repaired all the large and small roads around the village in one day.
