　　Han Village Compares Crops and Inspects Autumn Harvest

　　Good Crops Require Deep Ploughing and Abundant Manure

　　Break Down Complacency, Everyone Accumulates Fertilizer

　　[Our newspaper's Huguan dispatch] After the rain, Han Village launched a sudden attack to complete the third weeding, and the field seedlings revived. Most of the ears of grain are uniform and promising a good harvest. However, with favorable transportation, the masses are not very enthusiastic about accumulating fertilizer, and production is somewhat slack. Guo Anbao said, "These days, the masses are not paying attention. My team has only just arranged to go out for transportation, and there's not much grass to cut." Li Sijun said, "These days, there's a lot of rain, making the wasteland easy to break up and the grass tender to cut. Those who can sell vegetables are selling vegetables, and those who can transport are transporting. This year, fertilizer accumulation is not going well." To break this passive sentiment that autumn is good but not much fertilizer is being accumulated, more than fifty heroes, model workers, and active peasants were organized from various small teams to carry out a village-wide campaign to compare crops and inspect the autumn harvest. Comparing crops to see the benefits of applying manure; inspecting the autumn harvest to see if a good harvest is guaranteed. So, people gathered in the river valley and near the fields, inspecting everywhere. In Zhang'ao (the best land in the village), they inspected a piece of grain land planted by the lazy Han Xiangbao. He never applied fertilizer in previous years, but this year Xiangbao scraped the walls and made dozens of loads of manure, applying it in the middle of the land. The crops were very distinct, yellow on both sides and black in the middle, with empty ears of grain on both sides and solid ears in the middle. They also went to Xiangbao's other piece of corn land, separated from his second brother's land by a furrow. His brother hoed four times and applied a lot of fertilizer, so the corn ears looked like "clubs," while Xiangbao's looked like "jujube pits," thin and small. Climbing the mountain to Anbao's land (an active peasant), the soil was thin and rocky, all planted with King's Queen corn. Anbao had worked hard to nourish this piece of land with manure, applying more than sixty loads of pig manure and dozens of loads of wild manure. This year, the hail was very heavy, otherwise, this corn would have been even better! Anbao said, "I'm diligent in cultivation. After the hail hit, everyone said my corn was no good and should be ploughed and replanted! I wanted to try to revive it, so I revived it one by one, adding soil around it again. Now the ears are almost a foot long." Inspecting and studying, everyone said, "Farming always depends on manure and soil. It doesn't hurt to cultivate it a few more times. Without manure and soil, you can't get a good autumn harvest." It was further clarified that "farming is impossible without manure." Everyone spontaneously composed this rhythmic rhyme: The ground creeper blooms white, Anbao and Xiangbao, listen up: In Zhang'ao's best land, Xiangbao planted a few acres, He applied very little manure to the land, When hoeing, he only hoed the edges, Others' ears of grain are a foot and two long, Xiangbao's ears of grain are carrying guns, The ground is white and the stalks are yellow, The corn is not even a foot long. Everyone is busy with cooperative labor, Xiangbao is not anxious; Xiangbao never wears new woven clothes, Good land doesn't need much fertilizer, Good crops grow without cultivation, Work finishes early without cooperative labor. Now we compare and inspect, The stalks are thin and the ears are small, The weeds grow tall in the field. Xiangbao reflects every day, Now it's too late to regret; Look at Anbao's one acre and seven fen on the east slope, The King's Queen corn grows really well, He applied sixty loads of pig manure, He hoed three times to support the seedlings, He can participate in cooperative labor, If Anbao hadn't applied so much manure, The hail would have killed the corn. Anbao and Xiangbao, compare and see, Is accumulating fertilizer good or not? After a general inspection and comparing the ears of grain, Laiwang said, "The ears of grain are like dewdrops. It rains every day, and the crops can't stand the water, they'll be damaged!" Gaizhu said, "People starve under the ears of grain. Don't forget last year, when we were about to harvest, a frost ruined everything. Now the ears are all waterlogged, how can you say it's a good autumn harvest?!" Everyone said, "Even with this, the autumn harvest will be poor." After discussion, some people's idea of a "bumper harvest" was subdued. Finally, it was decided to conduct a village-wide inspection of manure and soil, actively accumulate fertilizer, and work hard in production, with everything planned for the long term. Comparing crops and inspecting the autumn harvest has mobilized the whole village. Everyone is afraid of being told that their crops are growing poorly. Anbao's corn and Xiangbao's grain have become the talk of the village, with everyone saying that accumulating fertilizer is a major task. Li Sijun said, "Our Han Village relies on farming. If we don't have a good harvest, what will we live on? We must cut more grass and accumulate more fertilizer. Farmers rely on the land, and nourishing the land depends on manure and soil." Li Laibao said, "What kind of fertilizer should we accumulate?" So everyone discussed it and agreed to scrape wild bark, cut grass, break up sleeping platforms, clean out pigsties, add soil, sweep road soil, collect sheep manure, etc. Cadres and heroes are determined to take the lead and promote fertilizer accumulation throughout the village. Everyone is making plans and inspecting themselves. There is only one month of fertilizer accumulation time before autumn. The village has 257 households and plans to plant 391 mu of wheat, striving to apply 80 loads of fertilizer per mu, with a minimum of 20 loads of pig manure, requiring a total of 31,798 loads of fertilizer. There are currently 24,423 loads, with a shortage of 816 loads. Autumn land totals more than 2,190 mu, with an estimated 40 loads of fertilizer accumulated per mu before autumn. In addition to the existing 27,573 loads of manure and soil, there is a shortage of 54,802 loads of fertilizer. The village has 182 male laborers, with 60 transporting and the rest accumulating fertilizer. Semi-laborers drive livestock, carrying coal in the morning and cutting grass in the afternoon. All laborers dig up sleeping platforms, scrape wild bark, cut grass, and everyone accumulates fertilizer, while also helping the families of soldiers to accumulate fertilizer first. The entire village has launched a fertilizer accumulation campaign under the slogan of competing to make contributions. (Hong Ren, Su Li)

　　韩庄比庄稼检查秋
  　庄稼要好犁深粪饱
  　打破麻痹人人积肥
    【本报壶关讯】韩庄雨后突击完成三锄，田苗复活，穗子大部莠齐，似有丰收之望，再加运输有利，所以群众对积肥劲头不大，生产也有些松懈，郭安保说：“这几天群众都顾不上，我队才订上脚出去运输，蒿也没啥割。”李四俊说：“这几天雨水勤，开荒是碎的，割蒿是嫩的，能卖菜的卖菜哩，能运输的运输哩，今年积肥不行。”为打破这种秋好、肥没什积的消极情绪，特组织各小队英雄模范翻身积极分子五十余人，开展了全村的比比庄稼检查秋运动，比庄稼看上粪利有多大；检查秋是看丰收是否有保证。于是川地近地人群满集，到处检查，在掌凹（本村上等地）检查到一块谷地是懒汉香保种的，年年不上肥，但今年夏天香保铲墙皮，闹了几十担粪，上在地当中，庄稼很显明，二边发黄，当中发黑，二边谷穗虚，当中谷穗硬。又到香保另一块玉茭地，和他二哥地隔犁一沟，人家锄了四遍，上的肥多，玉茭穗象个“棒锤”，香保的象个“枣胡”，又瘦又细。翻山走到安保地（是翻身积极分子），石厚土薄，全种金皇后，这点地是安保硬用粪养起来的，只圊粪上了六十多担，还有几十担荒粪，今年冷蛋打的还很重，要不这玉茭才好哩！安保说：“咱是做造勤，冷蛋打罢，都说我这点玉茭不行了，犁了再种吧！我想扶活试试，一棵一棵扶活，又搂了一遍围好土，现在这穗子，也有尺把长。”检查着，研究着，都说：“种地总是凭粪土，多造作几遍，不吃亏，没有粪土总收不上好秋。”更明确了“种地没粪总不行，大家顺嘴编了这样一段板话：地蔓开花白生生，安保香保比比听：井掌凹上等地，香保种的三亩几，地里上粪一点点，搂地时候只搂边，别人谷穗尺二长，香保谷穗扛着枪，地发白杆发黄，玉茭没有一台长。大家变工干的忙，香保不变心不慌；香保总不用织布穿的新，好地不用多上肥，不用做造长的好，不用变工完的早。现在检查比一比，杆又细穗又小，地里荒草长的高。香保天天再反省，现在后悔也迟了；瞧瞧安保东上的一亩七，金皇后长的真不小，圈肥上有六十担，三锄扶苗做的好，参加变工能做到，不是安保上粪多，蛋打玉茭是不能活。安保香保比比瞧，倒底积肥好不好？普遍检查后，比较起穗子来，来旺说：“穗子好似露水珠，每天下雨田禾见不得水，反要受伤哩！”改柱说：“穗子底下饿死人，不记去年眼看收秋哩，到嘴边了吧，一场风霜闹坏了。现在穗子都是水泡那能说是好秋哩？！”你一言他一语地都说：“就是这样收秋也要歉收。”经过讨论，部分人以为“丰收”的思想被征服了。最后决定全村检查粪土，积极积肥，努力生产，一切要细水长流长期打算。比庄稼检查秋，全村到处在动，谁也怕让说自己庄稼长的坏，安保的玉茭香保的谷，全村吵成风，都说肥积成了大事，李四俊说：“咱韩庄凭种地哩，不收好凭什活哩，总要多割蒿多积肥。庄稼人是凭地土，养地还是凭粪土。”李来保说：“积粪咱要积什肥哩？”于是大家研究起来，一致说得刮荒皮、割蒿、打炕、出圈、垫土、扫路土、拾羊粪等，干部英雄决心带头，把积肥推展全村。个个计划，自己检查，秋前只有一月积肥时间，全村二百五十七户，计划种麦三百九十一亩，每亩争取上粪八十担，圈粪最低二十担，共需粪三万一千七百九十八担，现有二万四千四百二十三担，尚缺八百一十六担；秋地二千一百九十余亩，每亩预计秋前积四十担，除现有粪土二万七千五百七十三担外，缺粪五万四千八百零二担。全村男劳力一百八十二人，除运输六十人外，全部积肥，半劳力赶牲口，上午驮煤下午割蒿，全劳力势圈、刮荒、打炕、割蒿，人人积肥，并帮助抗属先积粪。全村在比赛争立功的口号下展开了积肥运动。（虹仁、苏里）
