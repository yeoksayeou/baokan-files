    **Taihang Industrial and Commercial Bank Conference Defines Future Guidelines**
    **Combining Review and Building a New Economy**

    [This report from our newspaper in Taihang, dated the 24th] The Taihang Finance Office convened a conference on industry, commerce, and banking in late August, which concluded on the 20th of this month. The conference participants fundamentally summarized the experiences of the first half of the year and clarified the working guidelines for the second half. Wu Zuomin, Director of the Taihang District Bureau of the Industrial and Commercial Administration, delivered a summary report on the 17th, outlining all the issues discussed at the conference. He first pointed out that the most fundamental achievement of the industrial and commercial work in the past six months is that we have begun to find how to follow the mass line in industrial and commercial work, which is reflected in: First, breaking away from the circle of purely technical work in industry and commerce and recognizing it as a mass work. We have shifted from purely administrative orders such as restriction, control, confiscation, and punishment to starting from the needs of the masses and relying on the masses to manage the market. Second, we have realized that industrial and commercial work must be combined with the central task to be successful. Secondly, regarding the experience of several major tasks in industrial and commercial work, he also made a clear exposition: First, the economic struggle against the enemy, the development of economic work in bandit-occupied areas and guerrilla areas, must be combined with the entire guerrilla war. Economic cadres must participate in armed work teams or organize economic work teams and other all-in-one organizations to act in a unified manner in order to win. Second, the basic issue of market management in the inland is to combine with land reform, carry out squeezing out feudalism, overthrow feudal rule, eliminate feudal economic systems (such as brokerages), and transform the market, so that the city can serve the countryside. Third, industrial and commercial work in the new district must be combined with the mass anti-traitor and revenge movement to destroy the old chambers of commerce in order to eliminate bandit currency, prevent the entry of American goods, and establish a new market that serves the masses. Regarding the work in the second half of the year, Director Wu pointed out: Under the major tasks of review and production to overcome famine: First, carry out the movement to squeeze out feudalism and transform the market system. Second, carry out the grain protection struggle, organize grain regulation, and fully serve production to overcome famine.
    The main content of the banking conference was to exchange experiences in credit work. Currency struggle and urban banking work were also important topics on the agenda. Manager Deng summarized the credit cooperation, pointing out that the credit work in the past six months has achieved great results. There are now 613 credit cooperatives in the entire district, with funds reaching more than 320 million yuan, playing a huge role in rural production. The development of credit work is a process of exploration and self-awareness. At present, it has been affirmed that the credit cooperative is the farmer's bank. Farmers must operate it themselves, and the bank's task is only to support it. Deputy Manager Zhao summarized the experience of the currency struggle, emphasizing that the elimination of bandit currency in the new district, the development of the local currency market, the persistence of the local currency market in the border area, and the struggle against counterfeit currency must be combined with the mass anti-traitor and revenge movement in order to achieve results. Director Xue summarized the urban banking work, believing that the main task of the city is to serve the industries needed by the countryside. It is currently just beginning, and more experience needs to be created. At the end of the conference, Manager Deng delivered a closing speech, proposing that the working guidelines for the second half of the year are: participate in the review and production to overcome famine movement, continue to develop credit cooperatives in the old district, resolutely squeeze out bandit currency in the border area, develop the local currency market, and the city must participate in squeezing out feudalism and transforming old silver shops. He also called on everyone to join the investigation and research, boldly create, and make the banking work further adapt to the needs of the masses.
    On September 16th, Comrade Lu Jia of the District Party Committee made a special trip to the conference to report, calling on economic cadres to participate in the Three Check-ups Movement to strengthen their combat effectiveness and do a good job in economic work. Li Wangren of the Administrative Office personally attended the conference and made a report on the 18th, pointing out that the main task of the economic front is how to enable the emancipated peasants to achieve economic development and security, and achieve prosperity. Regarding the issue of unified leadership, he pointed out that the basic issue of unification is to unify to the needs of the masses, that is, how to serve the emancipated peasants. The leadership must break the view of the central being the only one, and the financial and economic system must serve the masses wholeheartedly. Only in this way can the work be done well.

    太行工商银行会议确定今后方针
    结合复查建设新经济
    【本报太行二十四日电】太行财办八月下旬召开之工商、银行会议，已于本月二十日结束。会中均将前半年经验作了基本总结，对于后半年工作方针，亦作了明确决定。工商管理局太行区局吴作民局长于十七日作总结报告，概括了大会讨论了全部问题。他首先指出：半年来工商工作最基本的收获，是我们开始找到了工商工作如何走群众路线，表现在：一、打破了工商工作单纯技术工作的圈子，认识到是一个群众工作。已从单纯限制、管制、没收、处罚等行政命令的做法，转变成为从群众需要出发，依靠群众管理市场。二、认识到工商工作必须与中心工作结合才能搞好。其次关于工商工作中几个主要工作的经验，也作了明确阐述：一、对敌经济斗争，开展匪占区与游击区的经济工作，必须与整个游击战争相结合，经济干部要参加武工队，或组织经济工作队等一揽子组织，统一行动，才能获胜。二、内地市场管理的基本问题，是结合土地改革，进行挤封建，打垮封建统治，消灭封建经济制度（如牙行等），改造市场，才能做到城市为农村服务。三、新区工商工作，必须对群众反奸复仇运动相结合，摧垮旧商会，才能达到肃清匪币，杜绝美货入，建立为群众服务的新市场。关于后半年工作，吴局长指出：要在复查与生产渡荒的大任务下：一、开展挤封建运动，改造市场制度。二、进行护粮斗争，组织粮食调剂，全力服务生产渡荒。
    银行会议，主要内容是交流了信用工作经验，货币斗争与城市银行工作亦是议题的重要部分。信用合作由邓经理总结，指出半年信用工作有很大成绩，现全区已有信用社六百一十三个，资金已达三万万二千万元以上，在农村生产中起着极大作用。信用工作的发展，是一个摸索、自觉过程，目前已肯定认识了信用合作社就是农民银行。必须农民自己经营，银行只是扶植的任务。赵副经理总结货币斗争经验中，强调指出：在新区肃清匪币，开展本币市场，边地本币市场的坚持及反假票斗争，均须结合群众反奸复仇运动，方能收效。薛主任总结城市银行工作，认为城市主要任务是如何为农村所需要的工业服务。目前方在开始，尚须大力创造经验。会议最后，由邓经理致闭幕词，提出后半年工作方针是：参加复查与生产渡荒运动，老区继续发展信用社，边地坚决排挤匪币，发展本币市场，城市要参加挤封建，改造旧银号。并号召大家加入调查研究，大胆创造，使银行工作，进一步适应群众要求。
    九月十六日区党委鲁笳同志特赶往大会报告，号召经济干部要参加三查运动，以加强自己的战斗力，把经济工作做好。行署李王任亲自参加了大会，于十八日作报告，指出经济战线的主要任务是如何使翻身农民在经济上得到发展与保障，达到发家致富。对于一元化领导问题，指出：一元化的基本问题，是要一元化到群众需要上，即如何为翻身农民服务，领导上要打破中心唯一的观点，财经系统要忠心耿耿服务群众，只有如此，才能搞好工作。
