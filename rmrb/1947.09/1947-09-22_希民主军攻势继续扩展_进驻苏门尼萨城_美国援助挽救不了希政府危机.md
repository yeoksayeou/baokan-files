Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, September 17th: Athens dispatch: The Greek Democratic Army headquarters broadcast that a unit of the Democratic Army, after crushing the resistance of a government army battalion and 350 fascist "self-defense forces," entered Suminisa City. The Lumeiliang Military Region forces advancing in the Agrafa area occupied the city after repelling the enemy. The Macedonian and Thracian Military Region forces captured five villages in the Han area and are now fiercely attacking Han, a railway city 50 kilometers west of Komotini. The Central and Western Macedonian Military Region forces recovered Kobanitz Mountain, south of Nistoria, on September 2nd, which had been occupied by the enemy a few days earlier.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, September 17th: Athens dispatch: The Central Committee of the Greek National Liberation Front recently issued a declaration on the political situation after the reorganization of the Greek government, stating that the Liberal Party and the Royalist Party government were formed under the most barbaric and undisguised direct interference of the United States representative. This once again proves that the Greek government has actually completely lost its independence and has further become a tool of US imperialism; at the same time, it proves that the Liberal Party has agreed to bury Greece's independence and is willing to act as a smokescreen to deceive public opinion. The declaration pointed out that the Liberal Party has abandoned its promises on domestic and foreign policies, and Sophoulis's proposed "amnesty" and "guarantee of trade union freedom" are purely a deception. The declaration emphasized that the Greek people have enough experience and will not be fooled by such conspiracies and deceptions again.

    美国援助挽救不了希政府危机
    【新华社陕北十七日电】雅典讯：希民主军总部广播称：民主军某部在粉碎政府军一营及法西斯“自卫队”三百五十人的抵抗后，进驻苏门尼萨城。在亚格拉法区前进中的陆麦梁军区部队，在逐击敌人后，占领该城。马其顿与色雷斯军区部队在韩特区攻占村庄五处，现正猛攻科摩替尼以西五十公里之铁路城市韩特。马其顿中西部军区部队九月二日收复数日前为敌人侵占的尼斯多利亚南部的柯巴尼兹山。
    【新华社陕北十七日电】雅典讯：希民族解放阵线中央委员会顷对希腊政府改组后之政治形势发表宣言称：自由党与保皇党政府是在美国代表最野蛮与毫无掩饰的直接干涉下组成的，它再次证明希政府实际上已完全丧失其独立，进一步变为美国帝国主义的工具；同时证明，自由党已同意葬送希腊的独立，甘作欺骗舆论的烟幕。宣言指出：自由党已背弃其内外政策上的诺言，索福利斯所提出的“大赦”及“保证工会自由”纯是一种欺骗。宣言强调指出：希腊人民有足够的经验，不会再上他那种阴谋欺骗的当。
