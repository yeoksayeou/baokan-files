　　War Hero Wang Lao Wu
　　Jiang Qing
　　(I)
　　Wang Lao Wu from the magnetic county's sixth district stretcher team is fifty-five years old this year, but he works even better than young people.
　　Preparing for battle, Wang Lao Wu was assigned to work in the Third Battalion of the 38th Regiment. The soldiers had just finished dinner and were preparing their equipment. The quartermaster ran over in a panic and said, "The battalion commander went to see the terrain this morning and hasn't returned yet. Quickly send someone to deliver some food to him." Wang Lao Wu saw that the soldiers were preparing for battle, so he volunteered and said, "I'll go."
　　He was only thirty meters away from the battalion commander, but enemy machine guns were blocking the way. He put the food on his head, crawled down, and crawled through a slightly recessed area. The battalion commander saw him, patted him on the shoulder, gave him a thumbs up, and said, "Old hero, not bad! If you hadn't brought me food, I would have gone hungry." After the battalion commander ate, he wrote two letters for him, one to be given to the quartermaster and one to the district cadre. Lao Wu nodded, smiled, and returned along the original path.
　　It was already dark, and everyone was worried: "Why hasn't he come back yet? Did something dangerous happen?" Just as they were wondering, they heard someone outside calling, "Quartermaster! Quartermaster, I'm back! The battalion commander even wrote you a letter!" Lao Wu said as he walked into the large kitchen.
　　"No, no, this is a letter for the district cadre," the quartermaster said, looking at it under the light.
　　"It's really difficult for illiterate people. I just saw that both of them had writing, who can recognize them?" Lao Wu said anxiously.
　　When everyone heard that Lao Wu had returned, they swarmed around him as if they hadn't seen him for days, shaking his hand warmly. Everyone was asking about the situation in front: "Are you afraid?" Lao Wu said nonchalantly, "Guns don't have eyes, but people do. As long as you are brave, calm, and think of a solution, what is there to be afraid of? Don't worry, everyone." What he said reassured everyone. Those who were originally afraid also felt braver.

　　(II)
　　The battle began, machine guns and artillery roared as one, and sparks burst everywhere in the sky and on the ground. Wang Lao Wu led everyone forward with great composure, "Boom!" A shell landed to their left. The four people in front crawled down, and the two people behind were a little scared and turned their heads to run back. When Wang Lao Wu saw this, he shouted, "Follow the model, those who want to be heroes, go forward!" The people who wanted to run also followed him up.
　　The troops had already rushed to the base of the city wall, and Wang Lao Wu's stretcher team had also followed to the base of the city wall. The troops climbing the city were about to reach the top, but they rolled down again. Enemy fire was concentrated on shooting at them, and the troops retreated slightly, leaving behind a wounded comrade that was not brought back. This time, Lao Wu was worried sick.
　　Lao Wu saw that it was very dark, so he came up with a plan. He took off his purple patterned clothes, fearing that the enemy would spot the target, and put on a black jacket. He crawled forward along the path they had retreated on, but he could not hear the wounded comrade's voice or find his shadow. Lao Wu was so anxious that he wanted to shout a few times, but the enemy was right above him, and he didn't dare to utter a sound. At this time, Lao Wu came up with a way, gently clapping his hands and listening for a response while crawling on the ground. The wounded comrade heard the faint applause and knew it was one of their own. He also clapped his hands gently. Lao Wu followed the clapping sound and finally found him. When he saw the wounded comrade, without regard for anything else, he carried him on his back and crawled back along the original path, wanting to crawl back in one step.
　　"Lao Wu is back, quickly put him down and rest, rest, look, your clothes are stained with blood..."
　　The soldiers slowly helped the wounded comrade off Lao Wu's back and warmly greeted Lao Wu. Lao Wu breathed a sigh of relief and said, "It doesn't matter, a piece of clothing is not as valuable as a life. I don't think this is where he (referring to the wounded comrade) should be. Quickly carry him to the back and put it on again." Then everyone quickly and steadily put the wounded comrade on the stretcher and carried him away.
　　The soldiers heard Lao Wu's words and said gratefully, "With Lao Wu here, what is there to be afraid of? It's an honor to sacrifice." They also took out cigarettes and biscuits for Lao Wu to eat. A short soldier said, "Eat well, smoke well, work harder, this time we must eliminate the bastards."
　　The second charge sounded, and the soldiers bravely climbed the city wall. Lao Wu's stretcher followed behind, rescuing wounded comrades. Not counting the previous times, he carried back four wounded comrades from the front line this time alone. Finally, Lao Wu also came back carrying the stretcher.

　　(III)
　　After the battle, a commendation and model selection meeting was held. Everyone chose Wang Lao Wu as a model. He said, "I've done so little, it's not as good as everyone else, but fighting Old Jiang and digging up old roots is everyone's business. I really can't bear to let others do it."
　　"Report to the chairman," a young man said:
　　"Lao Wu is a model for rescuing wounded comrades in the front, and he is also a model for carrying stretchers. That dark night, he carried them barefoot for more than twenty li. He should be given a meritorious service."
　　What he said moved the old man's heart. Wang Lao Wu rushed forward, tightly grasped the young man's hand, and asked everyone with infinite grief and affection:
　　"What, I didn't wear shoes, and you want to give me a meritorious service?..." As he spoke, tears flowed from his eyes. After a short pause, he continued: "I farmed the land for others all my life. I couldn't wear socks in winter, and I couldn't wear shoes in summer. Only my mother knew. Chairman Mao led us to stand up, he knows the suffering of us ordinary people. This time, I didn't wear shoes for half a day, and everyone knows it! And you still want to give me a meritorious service..."
　　The masses clamored: This one said, "If there is merit, it must be credited to the merit book, and merit cannot be concealed." That one said, "Wang Lao Wu should be selected as a first-class model." Suddenly, Lao Wu remembered something. The letter that the battalion commander gave to the district cadre was still in his pocket. Only then did he remember and took it out and handed it to the district cadre. The district cadre looked at it and shouted: "Everyone, stop talking, I will read this letter to everyone. This is a letter from the battalion commander of the Third Battalion of the 38th Regiment. Just listen to him reading:
　　"This time, Wang Lao Han from your stretcher team came to deliver food to me. He showed great bravery, composure, and resourcefulness while passing through the enemy's blockade. I hope you will credit him with a meritorious service because I am in the front..." As soon as the letter was read, everyone clamored again. This one said: "Lao Wu really meets the conditions of a model." That one said: "He has already established a meritorious service, and now he has another one. Merit upon merit, he should be a hero."
　　Based on everyone's opinions, the commendation committee selected Wang Lao Wu as a "war hero." He was awarded a flag. Wang Lao Wu, wearing a red flower as big as a bowl, smiled so much that he couldn't close his mouth. After the meeting, some young people said unconvincedly: "We young people are not as good as the old man. We must fight for honor. Next time, we must strive to be heroes and wear big red flowers too. Glory, glory."

　　参战英雄王老五
    江清
  　（一）
    磁县六区担架队的王老五，今年五十五岁了，干起活来却赛过年青人。
    准备战斗了，王老五被分配到三十八团三营工作，战士们刚吃过晚饭，都在准备东西，事务长很慌张的跑来说：“清早营长去看地形，到现在还没有回来，快派一个人去给他送点饭”。王老五一看战士们正在准备打仗，他便自报奋勇的说：“我去送”。
    已经离营长只有三十多米达远，敌人机枪封锁着过不去，他就头顶上饭，爬下，顺着稍凹的地方爬过去了。营长一看，朝着他的肩上拍了一下，把大姆指头一竖说：“老英雄，不简单，要不是你来送饭，我非挨饿不行。”营长吃过饭，顺便写了两封信给他，让他一个交事务长，一个交区干部，老五点了点头，笑了笑，顺着原来路回来了。
    天已黑了，大家都在着急：“为什么还不回来，出了什么危险了。”正在疑忽，又听门外有人叫：“事务长！事务长，我回来了，营长还给你写了一封信，”老五一边说，就走进了大火房。
    “不是，不是，这是区干部的信。”事务长在灯下一面看，一面说。
    “不识字人真难，我光见两个都是一样写着字，谁个认得呢。”老五着急的说：
    大家听说老五回来了，一窝蜂似的拥上来，好象几天没有见面了，亲热的握着手，大家都在问前边的情况：“怕不怕”？老五满不在乎的说：“枪没有眼，可是人有眼，只要胆大，沉住气，想办法，还怕啥，大家放心吧”。他这一说，把大家的心给装在肚子里了，原来害怕的人，也觉着胆壮了。
    （二）
    战斗开始了，三营担任主攻，机枪、大炮响成一片，天空里、地面上，到处爆裂着火花。王老五领着大家，很沉着的随着部队前进，“轰”的一声，一颗炮弹落到他们的左边，前边四个人都爬下了，后面两个人有些害怕，扭头就想往回跑，王老五一看便喊：“愿着模范，愿当英雄的往前上。”想跑的人也跟着他上去了。
    部队已冲到城墙根，王老五的担架也跟到城墙根，登城部队快到城上，又滚下来了，敌人的火力集中的向他们射击，部队稍往后退了退，留下一个彩号没有抬回来，这回可把老五愁坏了。
    老五一看天很黑，便想出了办法，他怕敌人发现目标，把一身紫花衣服脱掉，又摸上一身黑袄衣服，顺着退回来的路向前爬去，可是始终听不到彩号的声音，也找不到彩号的影子，急得老五总想喊几声，但头上就是敌人，想吭也不敢吭，这时老五想了个办法，轻轻的拍着手，爬在地上听声音，受伤的同志听到轻微的掌声，就知道是我们的人，他也轻轻的拍着掌，老五顺着掌声，终于找到了，一见受伤的同志，不管三七二十一，背起来顺着原路就往回爬，恨不得一步爬回来。
    “老五回来了，快放下休息，休息，看把你的衣服都染上了血………”
    战士们一边把彩号从老五背上慢慢的扶下来，一边亲热的招呼老五，老五松了一口气说：“不要紧，一身衣服总没有一个命值钱，我看这也不是他（指彩号）站的地方，赶紧抬后边再穿上”接着大家七手八脚很稳当的把彩号放在担架上抬走了。
    战士们听到老五的话，都很感激的说：“有老五在还怕啥，牺牲了也光荣。”又拿出纸烟、饼干给老五吃，一个矮个子战士说：“吃好，吸好，加油干，这回非把狗日子消灭不行。”
    第二次冲锋号响了，战士们勇猛的登上了城墙，老五的担架跟在后面抢救彩号，不算以前，光这次便从火线上背回来四个彩号，最后老五也抬着担架回来了。
    （三）
    战斗结束后，开评功选模大会，大家都选王老五当模范，他说：“咱出这点力，比起大家可不行，不过打老蒋挖老根是大家的事，光叫人家来，咱心里实在下不去。”
    “报告主席”一个年青人说：
    “老五在前边抢彩号是模范，抬担架也是模范，那天黑夜，他光着脚抬了二十多里地，应该记一功”。
    他这一说，打动了老汉的心，王老五向前一扑，用手紧紧的握住那个年青人的手，带着无限的悲痛，而又亲切的心情向大家发问：
    “怎么，我没穿鞋、要给我记功？………”说着他眼里的泪流下来，稍停了一会，他又继续说：“我给人家种了一辈子地，冬天穿不上袜子，夏天穿不上鞋，只有我娘知道，毛主席领导咱翻身，咱老百姓的痛苦他都知道，这次我半天没穿鞋，大家都知道了！还要给我记功………”。
    群众都嚷嚷起来：这个说：“有功就得上功劳帐，不能昧功。”那个说：“应该选王老五为一等模范”。忽然老五想起一件事，营长给区干部的信，还在他口袋里装着，这时才想起来，掏出来递给了区干部，区干部看了看喊道：“大家不要说话了，我来给大家念念这个信，这是三十八团三营营长来的信，只听他念道：
    “这次你们担架队王老汉来给我送饭，过敌人封锁的地方，表现非常勇敢、沉着、有计谋，希望你们给他记上一个功，因为我在前边………”信刚念完，大家都又嚷嚷起来，这个说：“老五真够模范条件”。那个说：“人家已经立了功，现在又一功，功上加功，应该是个英雄。”
    评功委员会根据大家意见评选王老五为“参战英雄”。奖给他一面旗。王老五带着碗口大的红花，笑眯眯的阖不住嘴。会后，有些青年人很不服气的说：“咱们年青人还不如人家老汉，要争口气，下次再来，要争取当英雄，也带上大红花，光荣，光荣。”
