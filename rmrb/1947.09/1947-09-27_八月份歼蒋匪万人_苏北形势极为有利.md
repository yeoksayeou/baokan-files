Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 25th: August was a month of unprecedented victory for our army in Northern Jiangsu after Chiang Kai-shek. The comprehensive battle results are as follows: Four Chiang Kai-shek bandit Major Generals, Han Yinming, Li Tiemin, Peng Dingyi, and Yang Nianxi, were captured, along with seventeen field grade officers including Li Huaide. 9,960 enemy officers and soldiers and "Homecoming Corps" members were killed, wounded, or captured, as well as nineteen naval officers. The following were seized: 66 various cannons, 2 anti-aircraft machine guns, 171 various light and heavy machine guns, 3,990 rifles and carbines, over 320,000 rounds of ammunition, one US-made 250-ton landing ship "Heyong," four steamships, and 24 trucks.

Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 25th: On the morning of the 16th, a unit of the Central Jiangsu People's Liberation Army once again captured Baiju Town, a key location on the Tong (Nantong) Yu (Ganyu) Highway, East (Tai) Yan (Cheng) section, completely annihilating one company and one platoon, totaling more than 160 men, of the 306th Regiment of the Chiang Kai-shek Bandit Reorganized 4th Division's 102nd Brigade, and routed over 400 enemy troops who came to the aid of Dongtai. Two 60mm mortars, 18 light machine guns and Thompson submachine guns, 2 carbines, and over 100 rifles were seized. The town was recovered by the People's Liberation Army in early August but was retaken by the enemy on the 20th of the same month. This time it has returned to the hands of the people.

Xinhua News Agency, Central Jiangsu, 25th: A reporter from the Northern Jiangsu Branch recently published a commentary on the victory in Northern Jiangsu in August, stating: August was a month of unprecedented great victory for the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Northern Jiangsu. The number of Chiang Kai-shek bandits killed, wounded, and captured was equal to half of the total number in the first half of the year, and the number of items seized exceeded the first half of the year. The morale of our army and people was unprecedentedly boosted, and over 9,500 liberated peasants flocked to join the People's Liberation Army. Over 1,100 of the remnants of the traitor Hao (Pengju), who had laid down their arms, also returned to the embrace of the People's Liberation Army. Local armed militias in the border areas launched widespread attacks to support the masses in resisting "land return" and conscription. In Huai'an and Yancheng counties alone, peasants recovered 3,793 mu of land and 62,466 jin of grain in just over ten days. The situation in the Huaihai area has also changed. Border areas that had been repeatedly contested by the enemy and us, such as the Anfeng Mountain area in Donghai County, the Dougou area along the Yanhai River in Guanyun County, and the Da Xinzhuang line in Huaiyin, which had been lost and regained three times, have gradually come under our complete control due to our active attacks. On the other hand, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits entrenched in isolated points and lines are under constant martial law and are in a state of panic. The command headquarters is also making abnormal adjustments. The Reorganized 4th Division, 51st Division, 44th Division, 25th Division, and Sun Liangcheng's troops are all rushing back and forth to make adjustments. As a result, although they retook the empty city of Yeting, which the People's Liberation Army had already withdrawn from, the situation in which the vast number of people surrounded and isolated the towns and were being annihilated remained unchanged. The enemy soldiers' war-weariness and desertion are becoming increasingly serious. On the Huai (yin) Shu (yang) Highway alone, 600 local bandit-puppet soldiers deserted on the 16th and 17th. The reporter continued: Of particular significance in the victory in Northern Jiangsu in August was that thousands of militiamen on the Yellow Sea coast, without firing a single shot, used political offensives to capture the Chiang Kai-shek bandit navy landing ship "Heyong." The ship's captain, Cui Laiyi, and 18 others, who had been trained by US imperialism, were tired of war and longed for home. After two days and nights of propaganda and education by the militiamen, they voluntarily laid down their arms. The ship is one of the ships used by the United States to aid Chiang Kai-shek in the civil war and is now owned by the Northern Jiangsu People's Liberation Army Coastal Defense Force. The reporter also stated: On the west bank of the Grand Canal and in the vast liberated areas north and south of Hongze Lake in Huainan and Huaibei, good news was also frequently reported in August. On the 28th, Huaibei annihilated two enemy companies near Jinshuo Town and seized eight machine guns. The vast rural areas between Yi, Fengyang, and Jiashan in Huainan have been controlled by the People's Liberation Army, and mass guerrilla warfare is now being carried out. The People's Liberation Army in these two places is like two huge steel pincers, threatening the southern section of the Jinpu Railway and echoing the Liu-Deng army's southward counter-offensive in the Hubei-Henan-Anhui region. Finally, the reporter stated: The great victory in Northern Jiangsu in August is inseparable from the national counter-offensive situation. Northern Jiangsu is the leftmost flank of the southern front of the national battlefield. After more than seven months of arduous struggle, the six million soldiers and civilians in Northern Jiangsu have persisted in the Chiang Kai-shek rear position. With the transformation of the entire war situation, they have begun to attempt a counter-offensive, led by the Yeting Campaign, and have taken on the great task of eliminating the Chiang Kai-shek bandits invading Northern Jiangsu, recovering lost territory, and expanding the liberated area.

    八月份歼蒋匪万人
    苏北形势极为有利
    【新华社华中二十五日电】八月份是苏北蒋后我军获空前胜利的一个月，综合战绩如下：俘蒋匪少将韩尹明、李铁民、彭定一、杨念熙等四名，校官李怀德等十七名，毙伤俘敌官兵及“还乡团”九千九百六十余名，及海军官员十九名，缴获各种炮六十六门，高射机枪二挺，各式轻重机枪一百七十一挺，长短枪三千九百九十余支，枪炮弹三十二万余发，美造二百五十吨登陆“合永”号一艘，汽船四艘，汽车二十四辆。
    【新华社华中二十五日电】苏中解放军某部于十六日上午三时再度攻克通（南通）榆（赣榆）公路东（台）盐（城）段要地白驹镇，全歼守敌蒋匪整编第四师一○二旅三○六团之一个连及一个排共一百六十余人，并击溃由东台北援之敌四百余。缴获六零小炮两门，轻机枪及汤姆机枪十八挺，卡宾枪二支，步枪百余支。按该镇曾于八月初为解放军收复，同月二十日被敌重占，此次又回到人民手中。
    【新华社华中二十五日电】苏北分社记者顷就苏北八月份胜利发表评论称：八月份是苏北蒋后空前大胜的一个月，毙伤生俘蒋匪数等于上半年总数的一半，缴获数则超过上半年。我军民情绪空前振奋，九千五百余翻身农民涌入了解放军。放下武器的郝逆（鹏举）残部，亦有一千一百余人重回解放军怀抱。边沿区地武民兵广泛出击，支持群众反“倒田”、反抓丁，仅淮安，叶挺（盐城）两县农民，十余天内即收回田三千七百九十三亩，粮食六万二千四百六十六斤。淮海区形势亦有改观，一向为敌我反复拉锯的边沿区，如三得三失的东海县安峰山区，灌云县盐河沿线陡沟一带，淮阴大兴庄一线，在我积极出击下，已逐渐为我完全控制。反观盘踞孤立点线之蒋匪，连日戒严，惊慌万状，指挥部亦调动失常，整四师、五十一师、四十四师、二十五师、孙逆良诚等，均仓惶来往调防，结果虽重占了解放军早已退出的叶挺空城，但广大人民包围孤立城镇的受歼形势依然如旧。匪军士兵厌战逃亡日益严重，仅淮（阴）沭（阳）公路沿线，十六、十七两日即逃亡土著匪伪六百余人。记者继称：苏北八月份胜利中特别有意义者为黄海岸千余民兵未费一枪一弹，以政治攻势缴获蒋匪海军登陆舰“合永”号，由美帝国主义一手训练出来的海军舰长崔来仪等十九人，厌战思家，经民兵两昼夜宣传教育，即自动放下武器。该舰为美助蒋内战舰船之一，现已为苏北解放军海防部队所有。记者又称：运河西岸、洪泽湖南北淮南淮北两大解放区，八月份亦捷报双传。淮北廿八日于金锁镇附近歼敌两个连，缴机枪八挺，淮南贻、凤阳、嘉山间广大农村已为解放军控制，群众性游击战现正在开展。该两地解放军正如两把巨大钢钳，威胁津浦南段，并与鄂豫皖刘邓南下反攻大军遥相呼应。最后记者称：苏北八月份的巨大胜利与全国大反攻的形势不可分割，苏北乃全国战场南线最左翼，苏北六百万军民经过七个多月的苦斗，坚持蒋后阵地，随着整个战局的转变，以叶挺战役为首开始作反攻的尝试，已肩负起肃清侵入苏北蒋匪、收复失地、扩大解放区的伟大任务。
