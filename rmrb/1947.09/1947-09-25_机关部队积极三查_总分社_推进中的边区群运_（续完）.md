    Actively Conduct the "Three Checks" in Government Agencies and Military Units; General Branch; Promoting Mass Movements in Border Areas (Continued)
    In the past month, various military units, government agencies, and economic departments in the border region, under the leadership of their heads and with the mobilization of all personnel, have successively launched movements to check class background, check ideology, and squeeze out feudal elements. In the military units, especially in General Chen Geng's troops, land reform studies were fully implemented, cadres were trained in batches, and the rank and file were mobilized to express their grievances. This greatly enhanced the class consciousness and strengthened the fighting will of the people's army. Furthermore, because the targets of struggle were handed over to the masses for handling, the military units were further consolidated, and a truly close relationship between the army and the people was established. In the past, the economic departments had a considerable "air-raid shelter" for landlords. After the movement, many targets of struggle were purged, which improved the organization of production, dispelled the concerns of the peasants, and strengthened the unity of workers and peasants. The movement in various government agencies is gradually deepening. In particular, the Taihang Administrative Office and other organs of political power have purged targets of struggle who had been hidden for several years, maintaining the purity of the composition of the organs of political power.
    This movement has become a powerful combat mobilization in the companies. After pouring out grievances, finding the "three roots" (roots of bitterness, roots of injustice, roots of poverty), seeking a way out, and dumping out "dirty water" (examining thoughts and getting rid of burdens), the 407th unit of the Taiyue Military Region realized that the landlord class and its representative, Chiang Kai-shek, were their irreconcilable enemies, and were the ones who cruelly harmed, killed, persecuted to death, and starved their parents, brothers, and sisters. The companies then separately held public memorial services for their deceased relatives, made oaths before the spirits, and resolved to avenge their deceased fathers and brothers, and successively made new plans to kill the enemy. Some units, on the basis of enhanced class consciousness, frankly reflected on thoughts of wanting to desert, fearing sacrifice, and randomly confiscating things. Comrades from exploiting class families wrote letters home asking the masses to settle accounts. Jiao Wubao, a famous hero who killed enemies, immediately wrote a letter back to his village asking the masses to settle accounts with his feudal rich peasant family after listening to the grievances of soldiers from poor peasant backgrounds.
    The paths taken by the various government agencies were generally similar. At the beginning, most felt that "there was no problem" and could not delve into it. To break through this obstacle, in addition to conducting self-criticism to correct their learning attitude, some used typical demonstrations to break the ice. That is, a responsible person from a department or someone chosen at random would serve as a typical example, or four or five people from different backgrounds would be selected as typical examples, which would all inspire and motivate everyone. Some used the method of "chatting about family affairs" to open the door. That is, each person would talk casually about their family situation, the situation of their family being struggled against, and their own views, and then proceed to check class background and ideology, even tracing back three generations. Some invited local Party committees to report on the land reform process in typical villages, and then launched discussions to expose thoughts, from which typical thoughts were identified and studied to enlighten everyone. Some invited units that were ahead to report on their learning experiences, which also motivated everyone. In short, generally, they started by discussing their attitudes towards land reform over the past year, starting with specific issues related to their personal interests, finding out what to check, and then reading documents to improve their understanding. Secondly, after the movement was launched, it was necessary to fully develop freedom of thought and guide everyone to boldly expose themselves. At the beginning, some government agencies focused too much on harsh criticism and chasing after thoughts in self-criticism and criticism, causing some comrades to have concerns and not dare to fully expose themselves. Some government agencies did a better job. Xinhua Bookstore once proposed that any doubts, any dissatisfaction, about any policy, practice, anyone, even attacks on the Party, could be voiced. As a result, everyone's concerns were eliminated, and almost everyone spoke their minds.
    Since checking ideology and squeezing out feudal elements are two aspects of the same movement, solving ideological problems must also involve solving specific problems. The Taihang Administrative Office launched the movement to squeeze out feudal elements on the basis of checking ideology, and in the struggle to squeeze out feudal elements, they further enhanced their ideological awareness. According to the experience of Xinhua Bookstore, the movement should focus on ideology, with other matters as secondary, and the complex and meticulous work of ideological transformation should not be replaced by simply chasing after wealth and treasures. However, hidden targets of struggle must be handed over to the masses for handling.
    The movement to squeeze out feudal elements, launched on the basis of checking class background and ideology, has yielded great results. The directly affiliated agencies of the border region government found vicious despots and landlords. The Taihang Administrative Office found major landlords Bao Qing and Han Zhenye, etc. In places like the Zuoquan County Government, the Yushe Post Office, and the Xiangyuan teachers, a considerable number of targets of struggle were squeezed out. In Xiangyuan, just in the factories and shops in the urban area, over two hundred hidden landlords were squeezed out. The bomb factory of the Logistics Department of the Jinnan Military Region squeezed out three landlords. The first batch of production departments in northern Taiyue squeezed out 59 targets of struggle.
    Some of the targets of struggle hidden in the production departments held technical skills, and some were "able to make money." Therefore, they had a certain paralyzing effect on the leaders. If the ideological problems of the leaders are not solved, the movement cannot be carried out well. At the representative meeting of the production departments in northern Taiyue, it was proposed that simple methods should not be adopted, and that simply driving them away was not enough, but it must be combined with checking one's own landlord thinking and checking production work. After research, the view that the targets of struggle were "able to make money" and had a "good attitude" was swept away, and it was discovered that the targets of struggle "were insufficient in production and had more than enough destructive power." Xiangyuan convened a meeting of workers and merchants to reflect on their actions. Zhang Jinxiu, the manager of the Yuhua straw hat factory, said, "In the past, when the masses struggled against the landlord Zhao Jinshan (the technician of the factory), I followed them to his village, fearing that he would be injured. Later, I let him go to Zuoquan and Handan to avoid the struggle. Now, I must resolutely struggle against him!" In addition to solving the ideological problems of the leaders, the workers were also mobilized to express their grievances and conduct mass denunciations. The trade union also strictly reviewed its members, so that the targets of struggle had nowhere to hide, and were exposed one by one. Units such as the Lita Coal Mine in He Village, Wu'an, adopted the method of joint struggle by workers and peasants. The county party committee, the district office, and the local peasants cooperated with the factory. If the targets of struggle intimidated the masses, the government resolutely supported them. For example, after the special agent landlord Cui Jinghua, who had infiltrated the leading group of Lita, was detained, he threatened people by saying that he would "sue all the way to the Party Central Committee and the Central Bureau." The government immediately announced, "Whoever resists squeezing out feudal elements will be detained!" The special agent's trick failed.
    During the development of the movement, the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Military Region ordered the entire army to conduct land reform education, the Taihang Military Region issued political orders, strictly requiring its subordinates to squeeze out feudal elements, the Taiyue District Party Committee issued a decision to block the "air-raid shelters" of landlords, and the Taiyue Administrative Office instructed the cleaning out of all targets of struggle in the production departments. Undoubtedly, all of this has provided a powerful impetus to the movement to check class background, check ideology, and squeeze out feudal elements.

    机关部队积极三查
    总分社
    推进中的边区群运  （续完）
    月来边区各部队、机关、经济部门，首长负责，全体动员，次第展开查阶级查思想挤封建运动。部队，尤其是陈赓将军所部，就全施行了土地改革学习，干部分批轮训，连队发动诉苦，大大提高了人民军队的阶级觉悟，加强了战斗意志，并因将斗争对象送交群众处理，更加巩固了部队，真正建立了与群众血肉关系。过去，经济部门曾有相当大的地主“防空洞”，经过运动，清洗了不少斗争对象，使生产组织得以健全，并解除了农民顾虑，亲密了工农团结。各机关运动正逐步深入，特别是太行行署等政权机关，清除了隐藏数年的斗争对象，保持了政权机关成份的纯洁。
    这一运动，在连队里成为有力的战斗动员。太岳四○七部队经过倒苦水、找三根（苦根、冤根、穷根），寻出路、倾脏水（检查思想放下包袱），认识了地主阶级及其代表蒋介石是自己不共戴天的仇敌，是他们惨害、杀死、迫死、饿死了自己的父母兄妹。各连队乃分别公祭死难亲属，举行灵前宣誓，决为死难父兄报仇，纷纷订出新的杀敌计划。有的部份在提高了阶级觉悟的基础上，大家坦白的反省了想开小差、怕牺牲、随便没收等思想。出身于剥削阶级家庭的同志，则写信回家让群众清算。著名杀敌英雄焦五保听了贫农出身的战士诉苦，立刻写信回村要求群众清算其封建富农家庭。
    各机关所经历的道路大致类似。开头大都觉得“没啥问题”，钻不进去。冲破这一障碍，除进行检讨端正学习态度外，有的用典型示范的方法突开了口。即由一个部门的负责人或任择一人作典型，或选择四、五个不同出身的人作典型，均获得启发推动大家的效果。有的用“摆家常”的方法打开了大门。即各人漫谈家庭情况，家庭被斗情形及自己看法，从此进行查阶级查思想，甚至追至三代。有的请地方党委报告典型村的土地改革经过，然后展开讨论，暴露思想，从中找出典型思想展开研究，以启发大家。有的请走在前面的单位报告学习经验，也推动了大家。总之，一般是先从对一年来的土地改革的态度，从对个人切身有关的具体问题谈起，发现什么查什么，然后再读文件，提高认识。其次，当运动展开后，须充分发展自由思想，引导大家大胆暴露。有的机关初时因在自我批评与批评中偏重了硬的批判与追思想，致使部份同志产生顾虑，不敢净尽的暴露。有的机关作得较好，新华书店曾提出：任何怀疑，任何不满，对任何政策，作法，任何人，一直到对党的攻击，都可以讲。结果大家顾虑消除，差不多都说出了心底话。
    由于查思想与挤封建是一个运动的两方面，因此，解决思想问题，又必须解决具体问题。太行行署是在查思想的基础上开展了挤封建运动的，在挤封建斗争中又提高了思想自觉。据新华书店经验，运动应着重思想，附带其他，不可把复杂细致的思想改造工作，用简单的追财宝来代替。但隐藏的斗争对象必须送交群众处理。
    在查阶级查思想基础上开展起来的挤封建运动，收获是巨大的。边区政府直属机关查出了恶毒的恶霸、地主。太行行署查出了大地主暴庆、韩振业等。他如左权县府、榆社邮局、襄垣教员中均曾挤出相当数量的斗争对象。襄垣仅城关各工厂、商店即挤出隐蔽地主二百余人。冀南军区供给部炸弹厂挤出了三个地主。（太）岳北各生产部门第一批即挤出斗争对象五十九人。
    隐蔽于生产部门中的斗争对象，有的是掌握着技术，有的是“能赚钱”，因此，他们对领导人有一定的麻痹作用。不解决领导人的思想问题，运动是不能很好展开的。岳北各生产部门代表会议上，提出不能采取简单办法，以赶走为满足，必须与检查自己的地主思想、检查生产工作结合进行。经过研究，认为斗争对象“能赚钱”、“态度好”的看法一扫而光，发现斗争对象“生产不足，破坏有余”。襄垣召开了工人、商人反省大会，裕华草帽工厂经理张锦秀说：“过去群众斗争地主赵晋山（该厂技师），我曾跟着到他村里，惟恐他受了损伤。以后又让他到左权、邯郸躲避斗争，现在只有坚决斗！”解决领导人的思想而外，同时又发动工人诉苦，进行群众性的检举。职工会并严格的审查会员，使斗争对象无隐身之地，遂一一暴露。武安和村利太煤矿等单位，采用了工农联合斗争的方式。由县委、区公所，当地农民协同厂方进行。斗争对象有威吓群众者，政府即坚决撑腰，如混入利太领导集团的特务地主崔景华被扣后，曾以“非向党中央、中央局打官司不可”的大话吓人，政府即宣布：“谁反抗挤封建就扣谁！”特务诡计破产。
    在运动开展中，晋冀鲁豫军区命令全军进行土地改革教育，太行军区颁布政治命令，严格要求所属挤封建，太岳区党委发布了堵塞地主防空洞的决定，太岳行署指示清洗生产部门中的一切斗争对象，无疑的，这全给查阶级查思想挤封建运动以有力的推动。
