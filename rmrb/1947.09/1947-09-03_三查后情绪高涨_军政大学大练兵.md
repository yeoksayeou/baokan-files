　　High Morale After the Three Check-ups
  　Military and Political University Engages in Intense Training
    [This Newspaper's Report] After the Military and Political University underwent the Three Check-ups study, it recognized the current situation, eliminated ideological obstacles, and, under the call of the school leaders, launched a training and merit-making campaign. In recent days, each brigade has successively taken oaths and set merit-making plans. Platoons, squads, and companies have challenged each other, launching a revolutionary competition. The 4th team of the 1st brigade, composed of squad and platoon cadres transferred from the 38th Army and various columns, just went through a wave of rifle shooting training. In just a few days, they achieved a score of 99% hit rate for the entire team, with an average of 17.2 rings, creating a new school record. Immediately following this, they set off a wave of machine gun shooting training. Every day, the students of the entire team sacrificed games and abandoned their afternoon naps, drilling hard for more than ten hours from before dawn until late at night. Within two days, the entire team could disassemble and assemble the five major parts of the machine gun in five minutes with their eyes closed. The 5th team of the 3rd brigade, composed of local cadres and civilian army cadres, started tactical training, performing crawling and rolling movements, and put forward the slogan "Sweat more in school, bleed less on the front lines." They trained hard, not afraid of heat, tiredness, or dirt, and quickly the entire team mastered the crawling and rolling movements. Mutual assistance, praise, and recreational activities played a significant role in the hard study and training. The canteen broadcast, the playground broadcast, and blackboards, which served as the main forms of praise, were all very active. In the short two weeks after the Three Check-ups, hundreds of comrades had already performed meritorious service for the people in hard training. (Mei Cun)
    [Another Report] Among the comrades from landlord class backgrounds in the Military and Political University, in addition to strictly examining their own thoughts and positions during the Three Check-ups and initially clearing away the remnants of landlord ideology transmitted from their original class, they are vying to write letters to their families and local governments and masses, expressing their attitude, mobilizing their families to properly accept the masses' struggle, and repay the blood and sweat debts to the masses. Comrade Yuan Cheng'yan, a student of the 1st brigade, said in a letter to the government: "I owe the masses of Fennan an old debt and cannot personally return to repay it. I really feel sorry for the elders and brothers of Fennan. Now I will return all the land owned by my family to the masses; in addition, there are two cellars in the backyard of my house where materials are hidden, one containing grain and the other containing clothes... please take them out and distribute them to the masses..." He also wrote a letter to his father, advising him to bow his head to the masses. Comrades such as Political Department clerk Sui Jinxiang, in letters written to their families and local governments and masses, mobilized their families to return property to the masses; some accused their families of crimes to the government and masses, requesting thorough struggle; some reported the location and amount of buried property in their homes, etc. Comrade Sui Jinxiang stated in his letter that he would sever the relationship between father and son and brothers with his father and brother who were evading the struggle. Comrades whose families are not in the liberated areas have all guaranteed to the organization in advance that once their hometowns are liberated, they will immediately write letters back to mobilize them to accept the masses' liquidation. Comrade Cong Zhong said: "...My family is in the liberated area. If my family is struggled against, beaten to death, shot, or kicked out, I guarantee that I will not be affected ideologically. I will work hard to learn my skills, eliminate Chiang Kai-shek, and make meritorious contributions to atone for my sins in order to repay the people!" (Mei Cun)

　　三查后情绪高涨
  　军政大学大练兵
    【本报讯】军政大学，经过三查学习，认清了目前时局，扫除了思想障碍，在校首长号召下，展开了练兵立功运动。连日来，各大队，相继宣了誓，订了立功计划，班、排、连队间，都相互挑了战，展开了革命竞赛。由三十八军、各纵队调来的班排干部组成的一大队四队，刚刚经过步枪射击学习热潮，在短短数天内，获得全队命中百分之九九，平均打一七点二环，创造全校新记录的成绩后，紧接着又掀起了机枪射击学习热潮，全队同学，每天从天不亮到深夜，牺牲游戏，抛弃午睡，一天钻研苦练十几个钟头。在两天内，全队都能闭着眼五分钟，把机枪五大部拆装完毕，由地方干部及民建军干部组成的三大队五队，战术学习开始，进行爬行滚进动作，提出“在学校多流汗，到前方少流血”的口号。不怕热，不怕累，不怕脏的苦练，很快全队即练熟了爬行滚进动作。在钻研苦练中互助表扬文娱活动起到很大作用。作为表扬主要形式的饭堂广播、操场广播、黑板等，都极活跃。三查后，短短两周内，已有数百名同志，在苦练中为人民立了功。（梅村）
    【又讯】军大地主阶级出身的同志中，在三查中除严格检讨了自己的思想、立场，初步清除了原阶级传染下来的地主思想残余外，争相往家庭及当地政府、群众写信，表明自己态度，动员家里人，好好接受群众斗争，偿还群众的血汗债。一大队学员袁成彦同志给政府的信中说：“我欠汾南群众的老帐，不能亲自回去归还，实觉对不起汾南父老兄弟，今将我家所有田产，全部交还群众；另外，我家后院，有两个暗藏物资的地窖，一个内有粮食，一个内有衣服……请拿出分给群众………”他又写信给父亲劝其向群众低头。政治部文书睢进祥等同志，给家庭及当地政府、群众写的信中动员家庭把财产还给群众；有的向政府群众，控诉自己家庭的罪状，要求彻底斗争；有的告发家里埋藏财物的地方及数目等。睢进祥同志在信中表示，和家中逃避斗争的父亲哥哥，脱离父子、兄弟关系。家庭不在解放区的同志，都预先向组织保证，一旦家乡解放，马上写信回去，动员他们接受群众清算，丛忠同志说：“……我家在解放区，斗争我家，打死、枪毙、扫地出门，我在思想上保证不受影响，我要努力学好本领，消灭蒋介石，带罪立功，以报答人民！”（梅村）
