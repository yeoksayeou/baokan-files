　　Investigate Class and Thought
　　Root Out Feudal Dregs
　　[This newspaper's dispatch] In the Ningnan campaign to investigate class and thought, those cadres with landlord backgrounds who evaded struggle and bad elements who shielded landlords were purged. After Japan surrendered the year before last, many landlords, puppet personnel, or bad elements who indulged in opium took advantage of our work to infiltrate into institutions, schools, and shops, engaging in sabotage either openly or covertly. For example, Zhang Jinghu, the principal of the senior primary school, was originally a landlord in Beiyu Village who had served as a puppet township chief. After joining the work force, although he was promoted from teacher to senior primary school principal, he still did not seek progress and opposed land reform in every possible way. A box gun and more than fifty packages hidden by the landlord were found in his home. The leadership dismissed him and handed him over to the masses for handling. This matter caused vigilance among cadres throughout the county. All institutions, groups, and schools earnestly launched investigations into class and thought. As a result, the county government discovered ten people including Liu Tingxiang and Wei Xizhi, who had been targeted for struggle and had served as puppet soldiers; the shops discovered Shi Pingguang, Li Ruifeng, and others. They shielded landlords, obstructed land reform, and shouted "It's gone too far!" "It's excessive!" When advocating thrift, they said: "What's the point of saving!" When implementing reasonable burdens, they said it was harming the poor. Although these people had received two trainings in the county, their landlord thoughts and stance had not changed at all. After discussion by more than two hundred cadres, it was decided to temporarily dismiss them, send them back to their villages for transformation, and re-employ them separately in the future based on their transformation and the opinions of the masses.

　　查阶级查思想
  　根绝封建渣滓
    【本报讯】宁南查阶级查思想运动中，清洗逃避斗争的地主成份干部和包庇地主的不良分子。前年日本投降后，许多地主、伪人员或吸食毒品之不良分子乘我工作开展之际，钻进机关、学校、商店，或明或暗进行破坏。如高小校长张景湖，原系北鱼村地主，曾当过伪乡长，参加工作后虽从教员提拔到高小校长，但仍不求进步，并多方反对土地改革，从他家中搜出地主隐蔽的盒子枪一枝、包袱五十多个，领导上当将其撤职，送交群众处理。此事在全县干部中引起了警惕，各机关、团体、学校认真展开查阶级查思想，结果县府检查出被斗户，干过伪军的刘廷相、魏席之等十人；商店中检查出石平光、李瑞丰等若干人，他们包庇地主，阻挠土地改革，高喊“左啦！”“过火啦！”提倡节约时，他们说：“节约干啥！”实行合理负担，他们说是坑害穷人，这些人虽曾在县受过两次训，但地主思想、立场毫不转变，经二百余干部决定讨论将他们暂时免职，送回村中改造，日后根据其转变及群众意见再行分别任用。
