Combining Reporting and Inspection to Conduct Merit Recognition and Awarding
　　Tunliu First District Creates New Leadership Method
　　[Report from this newspaper, Taiyue, 16th] The Tunliu First District has created a new method of combining merit reporting with work reporting, merit evaluation with self-criticism, and work deployment with merit-making plans. First, in terms of merit reporting and work reporting, because the leadership called on everyone to make contributions, every task to be an opportunity for contribution, and even if one could not make great contributions, one could still make small ones. Therefore, at the beginning of merit reporting, not only were model villages and typical examples understood, such as the model villages of Gaotousi, Shuangta, Guocun, and Gaodian, which were organized as a whole, and the model individuals of Qin Erzhi and Luo Dingcun, but also in other villages, general situations and skills were fully reported in bits and pieces. For example, Shicun said: "We have no merit, but we have settled accounts fairly, and the common people are very happy." Li Gao said: "Our village has resolved the disunity of village cadres." Luojiazhuang said: "Our village has opened a vinegar workshop, which has solved the problem of teacher expenses." Another example is Luo Dingzhi from Gaodian, who said: "When organizing mutual aid, no one wanted to participate, so I organized a small group first, and then everyone in the village organized themselves." This enlightenment changed the previous simple reporting of shortcomings and reporting solely to superiors, and began to pay attention to whether a good deed had been done for the masses, and to collect these materials in a specific, detailed, and serious manner. Secondly, the merit evaluation and self-criticism work was truly tit-for-tat, with every merit being contested. Therefore, in-depth discussions were held on the urgent demands of the masses and working methods. From this, good methods of comparing merits were learned. For example, Shuangta and Dongjia villages compared merits, clarifying the combination of agricultural and sideline industries with participation in the war effort. Shuangta village was organized as a whole, implemented equivalent exchange, and cleared assets in installments, and autumn seedlings began to be hoed three times. Dongjia organized women to weave cloth, and the oil mill and flour mill earned 30 dan of grain. During the merit evaluation of the two villages, there was a stalemate. After everyone's evaluation, it was determined that: We farmers should focus on farming. Shuangta is well organized and has not left an acre of land uncultivated, and the whole village is hoeing for the third time. Dongjia has good sideline industries but poor agriculture, so Shuangta's contribution is greater than Dongjia's. Another example is in the merit comparison between Guozhuang and Gaodian, which clarified the leadership methods and work ticket system for the policy of organizing women to spin and weave, etc. As a result of this comparison, everyone realized the shortcomings in their work, and the direction became clearer. Combining merit-making plans with work deployment, after the merit evaluation, the enthusiasm of the villages was extremely high, and they all launched a competition to make more contributions. After the leadership deployed the current central work, they also clearly pointed out: This is the standard for the next merit-making. Each village, based on its own situation, combined these points and formulated a merit-making plan. For example, Gaodian formulated a plan to ensure that four stretchers, eight rotating war teams, and seven transport carts are always ready, and to organize 50 women to spin and weave before autumn, catching up with Guocun. Guocun proposed hoeing three times and plowing three times, teaching ten women to weave before autumn, and buying five heads of livestock, creating a competitive upsurge.

　　结合汇报检查开展报功评功
  　屯留一区创造新领导方法
    【本报太岳十六日电】屯留一区创造报功与汇报工作、评功与检讨、布置工作与立功计划结合的新方法。首先在报功与汇报工作上，由于领导上号召人人能立功，事事能立功，不能立大功，也能立小功，所以在开始报功当中，不但了解了各村模范典型，象全村组织起来的高头寺、双塔、郭村、高店等模范村，秦二只、罗顶村等模范人物，而且能在其他各村，一滴一点的报功中，把一般情况与一技之长，完全报告出来。如史村说：“我们没有什么功，就是差帐算了，老百姓很高兴。”李高说：“我村解决了村干部不团结。”罗家庄说：“我村开了个醋坊，解决了教员开支。”又如高店罗顶芝说：“组织互助时没人互助，我先组织了一个小组动开了，全村人便都组织起来。”由此得到启示便改变了从前单纯汇报缺点，单纯对上级负责的汇报，开始注意对群众是否作了一件好事，具体详细认真的收集这些材料来。其次，在评功与检讨工作时，真是针锋相对，点功必争。因此，对群众迫切要求与工作方法，作了深入讨论，由此，学到了比功的好方法，如双塔与东贾村比功，明确了农副业结合与参战工作的配合。双塔全村组织起来，贯澈等价交换并分期清资，秋苗开始锄三遍。东贾组织妇女织布，油坊、粉坊赚粮三十石。两村评功时，争持不下，经大家评定：咱们庄稼汉应以庄稼为主，双塔组织好，没有荒一亩地，全村正锄三遍。东贾是副业好，农业不好，因此双塔比东贾的功劳大。又如郭庄与高店比功中，明确了组织妇女纺织方针领导方法与工票制度等等。这样比的结果，大家认识了工作中的缺点，方向就更加明确了。立功计划与布置工作结合上，经过评功之后，各村情绪极高，都展开立功再立功的竞赛，领导上将当前中心工作布置后，并明确指出：这就是下次的立功标准，各村根据本村情况结合起来，就订出了立功计划。如高店订出计划，保证经常准备四付担架、八个轮战队、七辆差车，秋前组织五十个妇女纺织，迎头赶上郭村。郭村提出锄三犁三，秋前教会织妇十人，买五头牲口等，造成竞赛热潮。
