　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th. Under the victorious counter-offensive of our People's Liberation Army, Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang is in a state of panic. The counter-attacking armies of Liu Deng, Xu Li, and others have swept thousands of miles from north to south, with their spearheads aimed directly at Wuhan and Anqing, shaking both sides of the Yangtze River. This has frightened Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang to the point where they have lost confidence in the mighty Yangtze River. On the 8th, Chiang Kai-shek hastily ordered Gui Yongqing, the Chiang bandit navy's concurrent acting commander-in-chief, to "fly to Jiujiang to inspect the river defenses" (Central News Agency) on his personal plane. In Wuhan, which is empty due to the lack of reinforcements, the Chiang bandit municipal government had to hastily organize the so-called Hankou "Volunteer Police Corps," gathering ragtag troops, with Chiang Kai-shek's bandit "party members and league members under the age of forty as the backbone." On the 4th, an order was issued, "limited to the 6th to form and the 7th to conduct a morning roll call" (Central News Agency). Liu Maoen, the Chiang bandit Henan chairman, whose territory was under attack by the advancing armies of Chen Xie, Han Kong, and Qin in western Henan, was even more like a crab in a boiling pot. After running around in Xuchang, Luohe, and Luoyang on August 25th, he returned to Bian on the 4th, and then hastily "accompanied the provincial police chief Qi Huiwu to Yi on the afternoon of the 10th to direct the local militias." Although Chiang bandit Defense Minister Bai Chongxi, covering his ears amidst the thunderous artillery fire of the People's Liberation Army, was able to declare on the 7th: "There are no major battles in the anti-communist war," he had to admit: "The situation on the border of Hubei and Anhui is not very favorable."

　　我军威逼武汉安庆蒋匪仓忙布防长江
    【新华社陕北十四日电】在解放军各路大军胜利反攻下，蒋家匪帮已慌做一团。刘邓徐李反攻大军自北而南纵扫千里，锋镝直逼武汉、安庆，威震大江南北后，吓得蒋家匪帮对滔滔大江也失了信心。八日蒋贼忙令蒋匪海军兼代总司令桂永清乘自己之侍之机“飞赴九江视察江防”（中央社）。空处的武汉因援兵无着，蒋匪市政府只得慌忙组织所谓汉口“义勇警察总队”，凑集虾兵蟹将，以四十岁以下的蒋家匪徒“党团员为基干”；四日下令，“限六日组成七日晨点验”（中央社）。在陈谢韩孔秦大军席西豫西下的蒋匪河南主席刘茂恩更象煮在锅里的螃蟹，八月二十五日在许昌、漯河、洛阳等地乱跑了一阵，四日返汴，十日下午又匆忙“偕省会警察局长齐惠吾赴伊指挥地方团队”。蒋匪国防部长白崇禧在解放军千军万马炮火雷鸣下，虽能掩着自己的耳朵在七日宣称：“反共战争已无大战事。”但他也不得不承认：“鄂皖边境形势不大有利。”（合众社南京电）
