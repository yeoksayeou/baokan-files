Xinhua News Agency, Ji-Lu-Yu, 16th: Before the Southern Expedition of the Central Plains People's Liberation Army under General Li Xiannian, a solemn oath-taking ceremony was held in Shihou, south of Jincheng, along with a grand memorial service to console the martyrs who died during the breakout from the Central Plains last year. General Li Xiannian began his sorrowful and impassioned speech with "Let us recall, who killed our beloved comrades?!" He called for revenge for the martyred soldiers. He said: "Comrades! I don't have much to say. I hope that from five o'clock tomorrow, we will take practical combat actions to mourn our martyrs." Political Commissar Zheng Weisan repeatedly instructed the female comrades remaining in the rear: "In addition to studying here, you must especially intensify the education of the next generation, telling the children why they became orphans at such a young age. Today, the People's Liberation Army is going to avenge them, and they should be taught to love whom to love and hate whom to hate." The conference ended in the sound of mourning music, and tens of thousands of commanders, fighters, and their families bid each other farewell and wished each other victory amid mixed feelings of sorrow and joy. Note: The Central Plains People's Liberation Army broke through the "encirclement and suppression" of Chiang's 300,000 troops in July and August last year, overcame numerous difficulties, and victoriously arrived in this area for rest and reorganization, finally returning victoriously to the Dabie Mountains a year later to reunite with the elders of the Central Plains.

Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu, 16th: The Taihang Xinhua Daily recently published a farewell letter from a certain brigade of General Qin Jiwei's troops to the people of Taihang. This letter was written when the brigade took an oath before the Southern Expedition. The original text is as follows: Director Li Yiqing of the Administrative Office, Commander Lu Ruilin and Political Commissar Lai Ruoyu of the Military Region, and all cadres and compatriots of the party, government, military, and civilians at all levels in each special district, and all comrades-in-arms: Since our unit was established, we have fought in northern Henan. With your support, guidance, and assistance, we have repeatedly defeated the invading Chiang bandits and participated in the battle to annihilate the Second Rapid Column, so that we have lived up to the expectations of the people of Taihang for their own soldiers. Now, in order to resolutely carry out the glorious task given to us by Chairman Mao, we are going south for a great counter-offensive. We must bravely fight out, overthrow Chiang Kai-shek, liberate the people in the Chiang-occupied areas who have long been bloodily oppressed by the Chiang bandits, and plant the victorious banner of the emancipated people of Taihang in the distant parts of the motherland! Now we are about to embark on a glorious journey, cross the Yellow River, and strike directly at the heart of the Chiang bandits! Looking down at the turbulent Yellow River and gazing north at the towering Taihang Mountains, our love for our hometown further ignites our enthusiasm to protect our fields and kill the bandits, defend our country and save our people! At this moment of temporary parting, we solemnly swear: "We are the strong sons of Taihang, the main force of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. We will resolutely carry out the orders of the people, fight to eliminate the last traitor, complete the national liberation, and fight to the end for the honor of Taihang Mountain!"

Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains Front, August 28th: (Late Arrival) Frontline reporter Wang Kuang reported on the crossing of the Ru River by the Liu-Deng-Xu-Li counter-offensive army: After the Southern Expeditionary counter-offensive army rapidly crossed the Sha River, the Chiang bandits panicked and transferred troops south, while also sending troops across the Ru River in an attempt to block the way. The three regiments of Wu Shaozhou's 85th Division and one regiment of the 64th Brigade of the 15th Division of Chiang's army first occupied the riverbank and villages around Runanbu, Dongxi Huanzhuang, Chenzhai, and other places along the south bank of the Ru River for more than twenty li on the morning of August 23. The vanguard of the People's Liberation Army also arrived before noon on the same day and immediately launched a rapid and courageous forced crossing. The artillery first destroyed the enemy's positions on the south bank with fierce artillery fire to cover the crossing of the assault troops. In the afternoon, the People's Liberation Army defeated and drove out part of the enemy, seized a bridgehead position about five li wide, compressed the Chiang bandits into villages several li away from the river, and quickly built a pontoon bridge. At dusk, Wu Shaozhou concentrated his forces and vainly attempted to form a ring-shaped encirclement to launch a counterattack, which was like a mantis trying to stop a chariot, giving the People's Liberation Army a good opportunity to annihilate the enemy. On the morning of the 24th, a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army launched a fierce charge after only a burst of artillery fire, and successively captured several positions, defeating the bandits and completely encircling the bandits compressed in the village. Although enemy planes came to support several times that day, the bandits still huddled together, daring not to move. The Southern Expeditionary Liberation Army then crossed the Ru River safely and orderly amid the sound of artillery fire and advanced south, while Chiang's "blocking" attempt ended in a disastrous defeat.

　　中原·太行我军南征前夕
  　誓师打倒蒋介石
    【新华社冀鲁豫十六日电】李先念将军所部中原人民解放军南征前，于晋城南石虎悲壮誓师，并举行盛大追悼会，以慰去年自中原万里突围中的殉难烈士。李先念将军首以“我们要回忆一下，是谁杀害了我们亲爱的同志？！”开始了他的悲痛而激愤的讲话，他号召为殉难烈士复仇。他说：“同志们！我没有多的话讲，我希望我们从明天五点钟起，就拿出我们实际的战斗行动，来悼念我们的烈士”。政治委员郑位三将军则对留在后方的女同志们再三叮嘱：“你们在这里除学习外，特别要加紧教育后一代，告诉孩子们，为什么他们很小就做了孤儿。今天人民解放军要去给他们报仇，应该教育他们懂得爱谁恨谁。”大会于哀乐声中结束，千万指战员及各家属在悲喜交集中互祝胜利而散。按：中原人民解放军系于去年七、八月间突破蒋贼三十万大军“围歼”，历尽艰险，胜利到达本区休整待机，终于一年后又胜利打回大别山区，重会中原父老。
    【新华社晋冀鲁豫十六日电】太行新华日报顷发表秦基伟将军所部某旅致太行人民留别书，此书系该旅誓师南征时所作。原文如下：行署李一清主任、军区鲁瑞林司令员、赖若愚政委并转各专区各级党政军民干部暨全体同胞、全体战友：我部成立以来转战豫北，在你们的扶持、指导、与帮助下，屡创进犯蒋匪，参加歼灭第二快速纵队战役，得以不负太行人民对自己子弟兵的热望。现为坚决执行毛主席给予我们的光荣任务，南下大反攻，我们要勇敢的打出去，打倒蒋介石，解放久被蒋匪血腥压榨的蒋占区人民，把太行翻身人民的胜利旗帜插到祖国的远方去！现在我们就要踏上光荣的征途，跨过黄河，直捣蒋匪心脏！俯视黄河奔腾，北望太行巍峨，对故乡的爱恋，更激起我们保田杀贼、卫国救民的热情！当此暂别之际，我们谨严肃宣誓：“我们是太行生长起来的健儿，中国人民解放军的生力军，我们坚决执行人民的命令，战斗到消灭最后一个卖国贼，完成全国大解放，为太行山的荣誉而战斗到底”！
    【新华社中原前线八月二十八日电】（迟到）前线记者王匡报导刘邓徐李反攻大军强渡汝河之经过称：南下反攻大军神速渡过沙河以后，蒋匪一面仓惶抽兵南调，同时又遣派部队赶过汝河，企图挡住去路，蒋匪军八十五师吴绍周部的三个团、和十五师六十四旅的一个团，于八月二十三日晨，先行占领了汝河南岸之汝南埠、东西桓庄、陈砦等周围二十余里的河岸和村庄。解放军之先头部队，亦于同日午前赶到，当即以迅速勇猛的姿态、强行抢渡。炮兵先以猛烈炮火轰毁南岸匪阵地，掩护突击部队过河。午后，解放军即将匪一部击溃与逐出，夺得宽约五华里的桥头阵地，将蒋匪压缩于离河数里的村庄内，并敏捷的架好浮桥。黄昏十分，吴绍周又集中兵力妄想构成环形包围阵地，进行反扑，这恰如螳臂挡车，正给解放军以歼灭敌人的良好机会。二十四日晨，解放军某部只一阵炮火，勇猛的冲上去，即接连夺取了几个阵地，将匪打垮，并将被压缩于村内的匪完全包围。当日上午，虽敌机数次来援，但匪仍缩做一团，不敢动弹。南下解放大军，乃于炮火声中，整齐有序的安然渡过汝河，向南挺进，而蒋匪的“阻击”企图，乃告惨败。
