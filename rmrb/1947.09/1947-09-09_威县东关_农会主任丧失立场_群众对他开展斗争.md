　　Weixian Dongguan
　　Farmers' Association Director Loses Standpoint
　　Masses Wage Struggle Against Him
[This dispatch from Jinan, dated the 7th of this month] Qi Xingyu, the director of the Dongguan Farmers' Association and deputy village chief of the first district of Weixian, shielded landlords, oppressed the masses, and embezzled fruits of labor. The masses have removed him from his post and are investigating him. Since Qi Xingyu became the director of the Farmers' Association, he has deceived his superiors, oppressed the masses. In the past rent reduction, wage increase, and land redemption movements, he always mediated alone, resolving things peacefully and profiting from it. During last year's liquidation movement, he told the landlords to voluntarily hand over some land and floating assets to block the masses from settling accounts with the landlords. Besides his own embezzlement of what was handed over, he returned the remaining wood and cattle to the landlords in their original state in less than ten days. He told the landlords: "Isn't the land they (referring to the masses) divided from you still for you to watch over? When the Southern Army comes, it will still be yours." Then he turned around and told the masses: "Words have been spoken, and land has been given, don't make it too extreme." In this way, he shielded the landlords, deceived the masses, and ingratiated himself with the landlords. He himself was originally poor, but in these few years of embezzlement, he has acquired more than forty mu of land, two houses, a wooden fence factory, a flock of sheep, and two mules. During this re-examination, the masses rose up to settle accounts with him, and more than twenty activists emerged to temporarily take charge of the village work. After removing him from his post and removing this stumbling block, they are preparing to settle accounts with the landlords again.

　　威县东关
  　农会主任丧失立场
  　群众对他开展斗争
    【本报冀南七日电】威县一区东关农会主任兼村副祁兴玉，包庇地主，压榨群众，贪污果实，被群众撤职清算。祁兴玉自当上农会主任，就欺上瞒下，压迫群众。过去历次减租、增资、赎地，都是他一个人调解，和平解决，并从中取利。去年清算运动中，他叫地主自动拿出点土地和浮财，堵塞群众对地主算帐。拿出的东西除他自己贪污外，下余的木料和牛不到十多天他又原封给地主送回。对地主说：“他们（指群众）分的你的地，还不是给你看着吗？南军来了，还是你的。”回头又对群众说：“话也说了，地也有了，别弄的太过火了。”这样掩护地主，蒙蔽群众，从地主手中讨好。他本身从来就穷，这几年的贪污即取得了四十多亩地，两所房子，一座木栏厂，一群羊，两个骡子。这次复查中，群众奋起向他清算，出现二十多个积极分子，临时担当村里工作，撤销其职务，搬掉这块绊脚石后，准备再向地主清算。
