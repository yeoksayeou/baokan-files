Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 26th: A previous report stated that the People's Liberation Army annihilated one enemy regiment in Daotou, southwest of Zhaoyuan (previously mistakenly reported as Yituo area). This was a mistake, it was actually 3,500 enemies annihilated. After investigation, the detailed situation is as follows: Chiang Kai-shek's troops risked advancing into Jiaodong. The entire 8th and 9th Divisions advanced to Daotou, southwest of Zhaoyuan, on the 18th. The 9th Division on the right flank was ambushed east of Xiadian, suffering over a thousand casualties. The 8th Division on the left flank also suffered more than 500 casualties in the blocking action by our forces. In the afternoon of the same day, our army again surrounded a portion of the 166th Brigade of the 8th Division that had advanced into Daotou. After a night of fierce fighting, the two battalions of the 948th Regiment and one battalion of the 496th Regiment of that brigade were completely annihilated. A total of over 3,000 enemy troops were killed or wounded from the three routes, and over 500 enemy troops below the battalion commander level were captured. The captured equipment included four 60mm mortars, nine heavy machine guns, thirty-one light machine guns, seventeen submachine guns, two hundred and ten rifles, and twenty-eight thousand rounds of ammunition.
