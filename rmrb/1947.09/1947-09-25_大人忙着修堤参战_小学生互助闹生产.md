    Adults Busy Repairing Dikes and Joining the War
    Elementary School Students Help Each Other with Production
    [This newspaper's report from Jilu豫 (冀鲁豫) on the 23rd] Guanmenkou Elementary School in Shouzhang integrates production with learning, ensuring that neither autumn harvest nor studies are neglected. The school has a total of sixty-three students, who, under the leadership of teacher Guan Shougui, are implementing the new educational policy of integrating teaching, learning, and doing. Seeing the busyness of war efforts and dike repair, and that there was no one to do the work in the fields, they held a meeting and organized a temporary production mutual aid group to harvest sorghum leaves and weed bean fields. The whole school was divided into six groups, each with eleven people, led by the teacher and Young Pioneer cadres. In order to speed up the completion of the task, everyone slept together and gathered at the sound of the whistle before dawn. During breaks, they learned to read, based on the principle of learning what they do. For example, when harvesting sorghum leaves, "Harvesting Sorghum Leaves" was used as teaching material, and rhymes such as "Production mutual aid has many benefits, saving time and labor and producing more" were composed. When there was no blackboard, they wrote on lunch containers or bricks. During the learning time, each group gathered to report on production and learning situations, and to evaluate merits and commend role models. Sun Wencheng's family only had him and his father, and his father had gone to build dikes. There was also a small newly divided calf at home that needed to be fed, but he still participated in production and learning, and had to cook and feed the cow, completing the mutual aid production tasks. Thanks to the efforts of all the students, the sorghum leaves of the military families and revolutionary martyrs were harvested in three days. They not only successfully completed the production blitz but also learned production knowledge.

    大人忙着修堤参战
    小学生互助闹生产
    【本报冀鲁豫二十三日电】寿张关门口小学结合生产，秋收学习两不误。该校共有六十三个学生，在教员关守贵领导下，执行了教学做合一的新教育方针，他们看到了战勤修堤的繁忙，地里活没人干，便有了个会，组织了临时生产大互助，打高粱叶、锄豆地，全校分六个组，每组十一人，由教员与儿童团干部负责带领，为了加速完成任务，大家集体睡觉，天不明就吹哨集合。在休息时就学习识字，根据做啥学啥的精神，如打高粱叶就以“打高粱叶”作为教材，并编成“生产互助好处多，省时省工多出活”等歌谣，没有黑板就写在送饭罐子上或砖上，学习时间各组集合汇报生产学习情形，进行评功表模。孙文成家里只有他和他爹二人，他爹又打堤去了，家里还有才分的一个小牛，须要他喂，但他一样的参加生产学习，还得做饭喂牛，完成了互助生产任务。由于全体学生努力，军工烈属的高粱叶三天就打完了，不但胜利的完成了生产突击任务，还学会了生产知识。
