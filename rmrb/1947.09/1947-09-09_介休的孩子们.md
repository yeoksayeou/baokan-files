　　1. You Don't Want It Even If I Bring Back a Gun?
　　Once, the Third District Detachment went to Chongxian Village. Old Man Zhang's son ran over wanting to enlist and carry a seven-and-a-half catty gun (referring to a rifle). Captain Shichang looked him up and down – too young, can't carry a gun! Rejected. As he was leaving, he turned around and said, "You don't want it even if I bring back a gun?!" The brothers casually replied:
　　"If you steal a gun from the 'Gou Gou' (referring to the Kuomintang soldiers), we'll take you."
　　"Okay!" He walked away in a huff.
　　Days passed.
　　In June – during the protection of the summer harvest, the team was operating around Chongxian and Wen Village. One evening, a little devil carrying a gun ran from the direction of the Shihe Bridge, panting as he approached the sentry post. When the sentry ordered him to stop, he shouted:
　　"I am Zhang's son from Chongxian Village, bringing back a gun for us."
　　The sentry took a closer look and indeed it was him, so he led him back to the team headquarters. Captain Qin accepted him without any problem.
　　2. One Platoon Covers the Second Platoon's Charge
　　The games Jiexiu children play these days are no longer things like hide-and-seek or riding bamboo horses. They imitate the army, form into lines, make various weapons out of sorghum stalks, and drill one, two, three, four.
　　One day in July, the Yi'an "Gou Gou Army" (stationed in Jiexiu) secretly came to Yaozitou to seize grain without firing a shot. When they were half a mile away from the village, they noticed a team drilling in the village, so they made preparations for battle.
　　Before long, the children playing in the village also carried "fake guns" and ran outside the village to "drill in the fields," deploying in skirmish formation and waving flags (paper flags) while shouting:
　　"One platoon covers the second platoon's charge!"
　　The enemy on the other side thought it was the Eighth Route Army charging out, so they opened fire with machine guns for more than half an hour before rushing into the village.
　　But the children had all hidden back in their homes, and the adults had all run away. The enemy gained nothing, wasted a lot of bullets, and never figured out what was going on.

    一、背枪回来也不要吗？
    一次，三区分队开到崇贤村，张××老汉底儿子跑来要当兵、扛七斤半（指枪），队长世昌上下一打量他——太年纪小，背不动枪！没收。临出门，他扭回头来说：“背回枪来也不要吗！？”弟兄们马马虎虎随口答应：
    “只要你偷出‘勾勾’（指顽军）的枪来，就收你。”
    “嗯！”他气呼呼地走了。
    日子一天天过去。
    六月里——保卫夏收的某一天，队伍又开到崇贤、温村一带活动，傍晚时分，从石河桥那边跑来一个扛枪的小鬼，气喘喘接近了哨位；当步哨喝令他站住时，他高声喊道：
    “我是崇贤村张××家儿，给咱们背回枪来了。”
    哨兵定眼一看，果然是他，于是引回队部，秦队长也就毫没问题地将他收下了。
    二、一排掩护二排冲
    介休小孩们近来玩耍的玩意儿，早已不是从前捉迷藏、赶竹马一类的东西了，他们模仿着军队，排成队形，拿高粱秆编成各式各样武器，一、二、三、四地操练起来。
    七月的一天，义安“勾勾军”（驻介休）一枪不发，暗暗前来窑子头抢粮，在离村一半里路时，他们发觉村里有队伍在喊操，于是布置妥当，准备战斗。
    不多一会，村里面玩耍的孩子们，果然也背着“假枪”，跑到村外“打野操”，散兵战式地展开，并且摇旗（纸旗）呐喊：
    “一排掩护二排冲！”
    这边敌人认为是八路军冲出来了，于是机枪声大作，足足打够半点多钟，才冲进村去。
    可是孩孩们一个个躲回家去了，大人也通通跑光，敌人一无所得，白消毫了好多子弹，始终也没弄清楚是怎么回事。
