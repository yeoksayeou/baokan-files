    Lucheng Third District Technical Committee
    Organizes the Masses to Plant Wheat in Wide Rows
    [Report from this newspaper, Lucheng] After the county-wide summary and commendation meeting in late August, the county's Technical Committee saw that five special-class model villages had won red flag awards. The leadership put forward that the flags are "alive," calling on everyone to perform meritorious service for the people and strive for the red flag. After the call was made, the villages in the Third District showed great enthusiasm. Shen Jianfang, a technical committee member from Shangcun Village, immediately responded to the call to plant wide-row wheat after the meeting in the Third District. He spent nine dou of rice to buy a two-legged seed drill and planned to promote the use of saline-soaked 169 wheat. Under the promotion of the central technical committee of Luhe Village (which won a red flag), the First Joint Defense Sub-district held a meeting to study fertilization and promote 169 wheat. Shiliang Village bought twenty jin of asphalt to apply to the land. The method is to rub the asphalt into ash and scatter it on the land, one jin of asphalt per mu, the benefit being that it can loosen the soil and kill insects. Wang Jihu, the leader of the Luhe Village technical team, studied planting wheat in large rows. Wang Jihu said: "Planting wheat in large rows has many benefits. The kernels are large, the ventilation is good, it is not susceptible to disease, it is not easy to fall over, and it saves labor when harvesting." The entire village plans to use two-legged seed drills exclusively. Also, because of the large expansion of wheat fields and the lack of fertilizer, they also studied and promoted the application of fried sesame seeds, oil residue, and the pressing of cottonseed cakes to compensate for the lack of fertilizer.

    潞城三区技委会
    组织群众宽垄种麦
    【本报潞城讯】本县的技术委员会，在八月下旬全县总结评功后，五个特等功村夺得了红旗奖，领导上当又提出旗是活的，号召大家为民立功，争取红旗。号召提出后，三区各村劲头非常大，上村技术委员申建芳，在三区开罢会，即响应种宽垄麦号召，用九斗米购买了一张两条腿耧，并计划推广用盐水浸一六九小麦。一联防小区在中心技委会潞河村（得了红旗）推动下，开会研究了上肥，推广一六九小麦。石梁村买回二十斤柏油上地，方法是柏油搓灰撒到地内，一亩地一斤柏油，好处是能虚地、杀虫。潞河村技术组长，研究了种大垄麦，王记虎说：“种大垄麦那方面也有好处，结的籽大、通风、不怕生病，不容易倒，割的时候又省工。”全村计划完全用两条腿耧种。又因大量扩大麦田，肥料缺乏，又研究推动上炒芝麻，油槎麦种，赶压花籽饼等，弥补肥料不足。（文辉）
