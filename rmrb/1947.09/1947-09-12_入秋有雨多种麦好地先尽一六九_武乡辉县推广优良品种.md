　　With the autumn rains, extensive wheat planting is encouraged, prioritizing the "169" variety on good land.
  　Wuxiang and Huixian Counties Promote Superior Varieties
　　[This newspaper Wuxiang News] The Second, Third, and Fourth Districts convened a meeting of deputy village chiefs and technical experts to discuss expanding wheat fields and promoting the "169" wheat variety. After heated discussions, they proposed planting more “Kill Chiang Wheat.” Everyone agreed that there were five advantages to expanding wheat fields: First, planting wheat can supplement the food shortage next year and overcome famine. Second, this autumn has abundant rain, which is beneficial for wheat sowing. Third, it can save labor adjustments and overcome labor difficulties. Fourth, the price of wheat is high, there are good sales channels, and there is opportunity for profit. Fifth, the masses trust the government's call, saying that what the Communist Party tells them to do is good. The specific method is to first mobilize the masses with facts, break through ideological barriers to form a movement, and plant wheat immediately after harvesting beans, yams, and millet. The Second District alone will expand wheat fields by 2,400 mu. It was decided to apply 50 loads of manure per mu, ensure four cultivations, and plow along the field edges and dams to ensure clean edges and dams. The current work is to create fertilizer, prepare land, adjust seeds, purchase plowing cattle and farm tools, and also to repair the land and use soil to improve the soil quality. In discussing the promotion of "169," the first step was to recognize the benefits of "169," which yields four to five more dou per mu than local wheat varieties, and is also drought-resistant. They also reviewed the reasons for jaundice last year, which were mainly due to low technology, dense planting, and in some places, due to insufficient understanding, planting "169" in the worst land without care. Secondly, seeds were uniformly allocated by district, proposing to plant every seed without wasting a single one. Everyone was very enthusiastic and requested to plant more, and proposed to improve technology and plant on good land. As a result, the Second District promoted 850 mu, the Third District promoted more than 1,500 mu, and the Fourth District promoted 1,000 mu. Each village should plant a seed-retaining plot, select seeds every year, and increase yields. It is also necessary to promote the local superior variety of Da Bai wheat, striving to plant 70 percent. (Fengqi)
　　[This newspaper Huixian News] The county farm’s experiments with planting "169" wheat and Qu wheat last year were successful. This spring, the wheat grew better than the local wheat, yielding three more dou per mu. The masses said at this time that they must plant it in the fall. Now that the wheat planting season has arrived, the farm has specially dispatched cadres to promote "169" wheat and Qu wheat in various villages. Using the time when the masses are eating, they promote the high yield and drought resistance of superior varieties, and promote that warm water seed soaking can eliminate diseases and insects, encouraging the masses to plant extensively. Later, they also talked to the masses about how the Golden Queen and 811 millet planted by the farm also grew better and yielded more than the local corn and millet. After hearing this, people from various places went to the farm to see and requested to leave seeds for them. (Aisheng)

　　入秋有雨多种麦好地先尽一六九
  　武乡辉县推广优良品种
    【本报武乡讯】二、三、四区召开副村长技术能手会议，讨论扩大麦田，推广一六九小麦，经过热烈的讨论后，提出了多种“杀蒋麦”，大家一致认为扩大麦田的有利条件有五个：一、种麦能补助明年的粮食不足，渡过灾荒。二、今年秋多，对雨麦子播种有利。三、能节省调剂劳力，克服劳力困难。四、麦价高，出路大，有光沾。五、群众相信政府号召，都说共产党叫干的就好。具体作法是：先用实事动员群众，打通思想形成运动，收了豆、山药、黍赶茬种麦，只二区即扩大麦田二千四百亩。决定每亩上粪五十担，保证耕四次，边头堰底刨一遍，做到光边净堰，当前工作是造肥垡地调剂种籽，置买耕牛农具，并要修地，土倒土改造土壤。在讨论推广一六九时，首先认识到一六九的好处，比本地小麦多打四五斗，并且耐旱，又检讨了去年黄疸的原因，主要是技术低，种麦稠，有的地方因认识不够，把一六九种到最坏的地里，不关心。其次，以区为单位统一调剂种籽，提出有一粒种一粒，不闲一棵种籽，大家情绪很高，都要求多种，并提出提高技术种好地。结果二区推广八百五十亩，三区推广一千五百多亩，四区推广一千亩。每村要种一个留种地，年年选种，提高产量。并要推广本地优良品种大白麦，争取种到百分之七十。（凤岐）
    【本报辉县讯】县农场在去年种的一六九小麦和曲麦试验成功了，今春麦子长的比土麦好，每亩多收三斗，群众这时候都说到了秋后一定要种。现种麦季节已到，农场特派干部到各村推广一六九小麦和曲麦，利用群众吃饭时间，宣传优良品种的产量大，抗旱，并宣传温汤浸种能除病虫，让群众大量种植。后来又和群众谈，农场种的金皇后和八一一谷，也比土玉茭及谷子长的都好，又多收。各地群众听到后，就到农场地内去看，并要求叫给他们留种籽。（爱生）
