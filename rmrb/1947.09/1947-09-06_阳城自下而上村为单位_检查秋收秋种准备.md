　　Yangcheng Conducts Autumn Harvest and Planting Preparation Inspections from Bottom-Up, Village by Village
　　[This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch, 4th] Yangcheng is organizing a major production inspection. The county has experienced a severe drought for six months, and planting on fallow land was delayed. Additionally, with frequent autumn rains and cooler temperatures, the autumn harvest is approaching, and current war support work is very heavy. Therefore, the county's Production and War Effort Merit Committee has called on all villages in the county to launch a major production inspection. The county inspection team departed in groups on August 25th. District Production Committees are leading district cadres, high school students, district cooperatives, and other organizations to form production inspection teams, cooperating with village production committees to conduct in-depth inspections in each village. The main content of the inspection is to thoroughly understand the weeding, land reclamation, and preparation work for the autumn harvest and planting, as well as estimates of income from special crops and sideline occupations, in order to further study and promote methods to strive for a 50% harvest in a 70% year. The inspection method is carried out from the bottom up, with villages as the unit. First, mutual aid groups report on their own, and then groups inspect each other. The village production committee organizes elderly people without labor and disabled veterans to conduct inspections based on the reports. Estimate income: Organize children led by teachers to inspect the situation and causes of weeding, wasteland, and empty land, inspecting while learning. The focus of the inspection should be on the production situation of impoverished families of military personnel, cadres, martyrs, and war participants. The inspection attitude should be honest, meticulous, and conscientious, with a duration of half a month.
　　[This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch, 4th] The base point of Lucun in the Second District of Ziliu, due to a lack of thorough inspection in the past, still had a large amount of wheat land unplowed and wasteland not eliminated. In every meeting, cadres always reported that the wheat land had been plowed once, the autumn seedlings had been weeded several times, and the wasteland had been eliminated, and so on. Finally, some comrades inspected the fields and discovered major loopholes, such as more than 100 mu of wheat land in Yuancun that had not even been plowed once, and the cornfields had not been weeded at all. After the leadership discovered these problems, they immediately convened a meeting of all base point village cadres, organized an inspection team, and stipulated that they would go to Licun and Yuancun on the 20th of last month to inspect the elimination of wasteland and the work of weeding and plowing.
　　[This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch, 4th] On the 13th of last month, the Second District of Tunliu convened a meeting of all district cadres to inspect the production situation over the past half month. According to incomplete statistics, a total of 914 mu of cultivated wasteland was eliminated, 1,115 mu of late-season crops were planted, 297.1 mu of vegetables were planted, more than 23,800 jin of wild vegetables were collected, the wheat land was generally plowed once, some had been plowed a second time, most of the autumn crops had been weeded three times, and most villages had launched a fertilizer accumulation campaign. Lingjin Village had already cut artemisia to accumulate 11,650 cartloads of fertilizer. Qian Baolin's family in the village accumulated 120 cartloads of fertilizer. In Xucun, each mu of wheat land was fertilized with 50 dan of manure. Gucun carried out textile production on rainy days, and Li Sisheng's group in Yuancun wove 40-50 bolts of cloth in half a month. In terms of frugality, most villages have managed to abstain from smoking and drinking, except for weddings and funerals. The reason why they can achieve such results is, first, that the leadership emphasizes actively increasing production, rather than simply saving as in 1942. In terms of increasing production, they also calculated accounts for the masses. For example, weaving and dyeing indigo are better than growing vegetables, so they lead the masses to weave cloth and dye indigo, while children are asked to collect wild vegetables; second, it is due to the development of the merit campaign. For example, the county stipulates the conditions for meritorious service for cadres at all levels, the first of which is to pay attention to production and prepare for famine, so many farmers say: "Working hard on production for ourselves can also earn merit, it's really a win-win situation."

　　阳城自下而上村为单位
  　检查秋收秋种准备
    【本报太岳四日电】阳城组织生产大检查。该县因大旱半年，茬地种的很晚，又加现在秋雨多，气候凉，秋收快到，近日战勤工作又甚繁重。因此，县生产参战立功委员会，特号召全县各村展开生产大检查。县检查团已于八月二十五日分组出发，区生产委员会领导区干部、高小学校、区联社等组织生产检查队，配合各村生产委员会，深入各村进行检查。检查内容主要深入了解锄苗、开荒和秋收、秋种的准备工作，以及特种作物副业收入的估计，以便进一步研究推动办法，争取五成年景七成收。检查办法是自下而上的进行，以村为单位，先由互助组自报，然后组和组互相检查。村生产委员会根据报告，组织无劳力老汉和残废荣军进行检查。估计收入：组织儿童由教员带领，检查锄地荒地和空白地情形与原因，一面检查，一面学习。检查重点应放在贫苦的军干烈属和参战人员的生产情况；检查态度要老实、细致、认真，时间为半个月。
    【本报太岳四日电】自留二区路村基点因过去未经深入检查，还存在大批麦地未犁，荒地未消灭。在每次会议上，干部总是汇报麦地犁完了第一遍啦，秋苗又锄过几遍啦，荒地消灭完啦等等。最后，有的同志到地里一检查发现了大漏洞，如原村有一百多亩麦地还没犁一遍，玉茭地根本没有锄过。领导上发现这些问题后，即召开全基点村干部会，组织检查团，规定于上月二十日分别到栗村、原村检查荒地消灭的情形及锄苗犁地等工作。
    【本报太岳四日电】屯留二区于上月十三日召开全体区干会议，检查半月来的生产情形。据不完全统计，共消灭熟荒九百一十四亩，种晚田一千一百十五亩，种菜二百九十七亩一分，采野菜两万三千八百余斤，麦地普遍犁完了头遍，有的已犁第二遍，秋禾大部锄完了三遍、大部村子并展开积肥运动。岭近村已割蒿积肥一万一千六百五十车，该村乾保林一家积肥一百二十车。许村麦地每亩上粪到五十担。谷村雨天进行纺织，原村李思圣组半月内即织布四五十匹。在节约方面，一般村都作到除办婚丧事外，都戒了烟酒。其所以能作到如此成绩，第一是领导上强调积极增产，而不是如四二年的单纯节约。在增产上，又给群众算帐，如纺织打靛比打菜强，就领导群众织布打靛，打野菜则叫儿童干；第二是由于开展了立功运动，如县上规定各级干部的立功条件，第一条就是注意生产备荒，所以好多农民说：“给自己闹生产，还能立功，真是名利双全”。
