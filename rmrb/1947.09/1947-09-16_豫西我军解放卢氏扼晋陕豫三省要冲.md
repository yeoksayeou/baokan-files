Xinhua News Agency, Western Henan Front, 14th: The counter-offensive army under General Chen Geng, after annihilating more than 7,000 Chiang bandits and liberating five county towns in western Henan, liberated Lushi County town, a strategic military location southeast of Tongguan, on the 10th. The results of the battle are still being investigated. Lushi is a strategic point for the three provinces of Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Henan, bordering the Qinling Mountains to the west and connecting to the Funiu Mountains in the east. It is located on the banks of the Yi River, more than 80 kilometers northwest of the natural barrier of Tongguan and 60 kilometers south of Jingziguan, the gateway to Henan, Hubei, and Shaanxi. As early as the day after our Generals Chen and Xie crossed the river, the Chiang bandit rumor company, the Central News Agency, was trembling and shouting: "There is an appearance of encroaching on Lushi." However, its Xi'an dispatch on the 12th still stated, "The fierce battle continued until late in the evening of the 11th, and the situation in the city was unclear until about 11:00 p.m." In fact, the "situation" in the city had been "unclear" a day earlier.

　　豫西我军解放卢氏扼晋陕豫三省要冲
    【新华社豫西前线十四日电】陈赓将军所部反攻大军于歼灭蒋匪七千余，解放豫西县城五座后，复于十日解放潼关东南军事要地卢氏县城，战果正清查中。卢氏为晋陕豫三省要冲，西接秦岭，东连伏牛，位伊水之滨，西北距潼关天险八十余公里，南距豫鄂陕门户荆紫关六十余公里。早在我陈谢诸将军渡河之后一日，蒋匪造谣公司中央社就在发抖的号叫：“有窜犯卢氏模样”，而它的西安十二日电中，还说“十一日薄暮激战至烈，迄午夜十一时许该城情况不明”；事实上该城早一天就已经“情况不明”了。
