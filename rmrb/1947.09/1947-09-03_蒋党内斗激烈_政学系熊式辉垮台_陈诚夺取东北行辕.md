Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 31st. According to a Central News Agency broadcast: The Chiang government issued an order on the 29th relieving Xiong Shihui, a heavyweight of the Political Science Clique, of his position as Director of the Northeast Headquarters, and appointing Chief of Staff Chen Cheng to concurrently hold the position. Chen Cheng is scheduled to fly from Nanjing to Shenyang today to take office. The personnel turbulence and upheavals in the Northeast Chiang regime over the past two months are a manifestation of the deepening military crisis faced by Chiang Kai-shek in the Northeast following the Democratic Allied Forces' launch of the Summer Offensive from mid-May to late June. Factional infighting among Chiang's generals and party members, which usually takes place behind the scenes for the sake of power and profit, becomes apparent whenever there are military setbacks. Chiang Kai-shek invariably blames his subordinates for the failures, ruthlessly discarding them one by one. Consequently, the Whampoa clique (Du Yuming) lost command of the Northeast army first, and the Political Science Clique's rule in the Northeast collapsed along with it. The conflict between Chen Cheng and the Political Science Clique has reached fever pitch. The two rich plums of Taiwan and the Northeast have successively left the control of the Political Science Clique, but the Political Science Clique is desperately trying to seize the military leadership. Conversely, the power of Chen Cheng's faction has expanded to the extreme due to its seizure of military and political power in the Northeast. Prior to this, Chen Cheng actively expanded the power of his faction, concurrently holding the position of Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, with Gui Yongqing, the Deputy Commander-in-Chief, being his subordinate. Zhou Zhirou, Commander-in-Chief of the Air Force, is also an old subordinate of his. Guo Chan, Commander-in-Chief of Logistics, is his confidant. Recently, he also placed his favorite Sun Liren in the Army Headquarters. It is widely believed that the day Chen Cheng rolls off the stage will not be far off. The current difficulties faced by Chiang Kai-shek's army in the Northeast, as the Associated Press Shanghai dispatch of the 29th stated, are "almost" the same as when Du Yuming was in office, and its future is "not optimistic." The Associated Press then said, "This matter will soon be known."

　　蒋党内斗激烈
  　政学系熊式辉垮台
  　陈诚夺取东北行辕
    【新华社陕北卅一日电】据中央社广播：蒋政府已于二十九日命令免除政学系巨头熊式辉东北行辕主任一职，而以参谋总长陈诚兼任，陈诚定今日由南京飞沈阳就职。过去两月来东北蒋政权人事动荡浮沉，是五月中至六月底民主联军发动夏季攻势之后，蒋介石在东北的军事危机深刻化的表现。平时在幕后进行的蒋军蒋党各派系将领间争权夺利的派别倾轧，一遇军事失利就表面化，而蒋介石则总是将失败迁怒于其手下的将领，残酷无情的把他们一个一个的丢弃台下。于是黄埔系（杜聿明）失掉东北军队指挥权于先，政学系在东北的统治也跟着垮台了。陈诚与政学系的冲突到了白热化的程度。台湾、东北两块肥肉已先后离开了政学系的掌握，但政学系则极力企图夺取军事首脑部。与此相反的，是陈诚派的势力，已由于攫取到东北的军政大权而膨胀到极度。在此以前，陈诚积极扩张自己一派的势力，海军总司令由他自己兼任，代总司令的桂永清则是他的部下，空军总司令周至柔也是他的老部属；后勤总司令郭忏是他的亲信；最近在陆军总司令部方面也安置了他宠爱的孙立人。众信陈诚从台上滚下去的日子也不会远了。目前蒋介石军在东北的困难，正如美联社上海二十九日电所说：和杜聿明在任时“差不多”，其前途“并不乐观”。美联社接着说：“这件事不久便可分晓。”
