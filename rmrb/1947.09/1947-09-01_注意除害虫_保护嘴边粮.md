　　Pay Attention to Eliminating Pests
  　Protect the Food Supply
    [This newspaper reports] Recently, after several days of continuous rain, a pest infestation was discovered. In Shahe County's second, third, fourth, and sixth districts, a total of more than 1,870 mu were affected. In Wu'an's fifth district, the pest-infested area around Lianfan and other villages stretched about eighteen li in length and three li in width. In Chengci's first, second, fourth, and seventh districts, pests appeared around the 16th of this month. On the stalks of the millet, there were four, five, six, seven, or as many as sixteen or seventeen insects. They were black, white, yellow, red, green, and purple, with six colors, etc. The large ones were over an inch long, and the common ones were six or seven fen long. They specifically ate millet leaves, and the black insects were the most voracious. After the various counties and districts discovered the infestation, they urgently mobilized, leading the masses to capture and kill the pests. Shahe's first district first organized inspection teams, using joint defense units, to conduct inspections separately, and to eliminate the pests wherever they were severe. On the 17th, 1,654 men and women, old and young, from the West Seventh Village joint defense unit, formed a pest-killing team and cleared 275 mu in one day. In Wu'an's fifth district, more than 5,000 people killed many pests on the 17th and 18th. Zhang and Liu, section chiefs of the Chengci County government, and an instructor from the Public Security Bureau, along with more than ten soldiers, led the masses in the urban area to capture and kill the pests! At first, the masses were afraid of trampling on their crops and were unwilling to fight the pests. Some of the masses were superstitious, believing they were "divine insects," saying, "They will be gone when the northwest wind blows!" The director of the North Yukou Farmers' Association in Chengci said at a mass meeting: "Eliminating pests is protecting our own rice bowls!" An on-the-spot discussion stipulated, "Everyone stands on one row without destroying the seedlings. Whoever destroys the seedlings will be fined to boil water for everyone." After arriving in the fields, a competition was held to see who could hit the fastest, the best, and without destroying the seedlings! In three hours, more than 560 people completely eliminated the pests on fifteen mu! Their specific methods were: (1) Mobilize all the manpower in the village to go to the fields. (2) The director of the Farmers' Association serves as the commander-in-chief, and everyone lies down to catch insects when the command is given, and everyone gets up to cool off when the command is given again. (3) Form three rows to fight forward, which is three sweeps. Wives and children are in the first row, young and middle-aged women are in the second row, and men are in the third row, one row per person. (4) Each row has representatives from the Farmers' Association at both ends, and small group leaders in the middle, to control the speed, because if people are not aligned, the insects will not be easily caught. (5) If an individual or a team does well, the commander-in-chief will praise them in person with a megaphone.

　　注意除害虫
  　保护嘴边粮
    【本报讯】最近几天连阴雨后，发现虫灾。沙河县二、三、四、六区共一千八百七十余亩，武安五区连凡等村虫灾面积约长十八里宽三里，成磁一、二、四、七区于本月十六日左右发生害虫。大谷秆上四五个六七个多则十六七个不等，有黑、白、黄、红、绿、紫花六色等，大的一寸多长，普通六七分长，专吃谷叶，最利害的是黑虫。各县区发现后，紧急动员起来，率领群众进行捕打。沙河一区首先组织检查队以联防为单位，分头检查，那里严重就消灭在那里。十七日西七村联防男女老幼一千六百五十四人，组成打虫队，一天肃清二百七十五亩。武安五区十七、十八两天五千余人，消灭甚多。成磁县政府张刘二科长、公安局指导员同十余名战士率领城关群众捕打！开始时群众都怕踏坏了自己的庄稼不愿打，部分群众迷信，认为是“神虫”，说“西北风一刮就没有了”！成磁北鱼口农会主任在群众大会上说：“灭虫是保护自己饭碗”！当场讨论规定“每人站一垄不毁苗子，谁毁了苗罚他给大家烧水”。到地后进行竞赛，谁打的快，打的好，不毁苗！三个钟头五百六十余人，把十五亩的虫害完全消灭了！他们的具体办法是：（一）动员全村人力都下地。（二）农会主任担任总指挥，一喊口号都伏下捕虫，再喊口号都露出来凉快。（三）排成三行往前打，过去就是三遍，老婆小孩在第一行，青壮妇女在第二行，男人在第三行，每人一垄。（四）每行两头有农会代表，行中间有小组长，掌握快慢，因为人摆不齐，虫就不容易打净。（五）一个人或一个队打的好，由总指挥当面用喇叭筒表扬。
