Militias in various places are actively reorganizing and training, preparing for expeditions. In Fanshi, 1,500 young adults poured into the counter-offensive army within five days. In Dingxiang, two groups of young adults joining the army totaled more than 980 people. In Wangdu's third district, more than 500 young adults voluntarily signed up to join the army, and many heroic models of joining the army emerged. Chengguan in Fanshi, under the leadership of party member cadres, organized a counter-offensive company. Kang Yuan, a teacher from the fifth primary school in the county, led eleven students to join the army to help in the war. Hai, a resident of Xu Wangzhuang, Wangdu, convened a family meeting to send his son to join the army, and at the meeting, two sons competed to join the army. When Pan, an old woman from Qujiawan, sent her son to join the army, she said: "My family has been allocated more than 30 mu of land. I want to send my son to the army to overthrow Chiang Kai-shek so that all poor people in the world can have land to till." Ding Ning, the head of the judicial section of Lingqiu County, voluntarily signed up to join the army at the military service conference and was awarded the title of "Model of Joining the Army." Party member cadres in the First Military Subdistrict also actively participated in the militia, greatly improving the quality of the militia. The Tang County militia voluntarily practiced martial arts and actively collected manure before the autumn harvest in order to plant wheat earlier, waiting for the expedition. Women worked day and night to make expedition shoes and expedition clothes for their husbands. In addition to the scheduled training, the militia in the third district of Wan County also automatically practiced martial arts at night. The Maguzhuang guerrilla team in Quyang practiced collective sleeping and collective work, practicing shooting, aiming, and laying mines whenever they had time.
