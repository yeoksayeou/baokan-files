Xinhua News Agency, Jinji Luyu, 11th: Late news: On August 26th, the Independent Battalion of Huolu County, Taihang, took the initiative to attack Nantongye Town, an important enemy stronghold on the periphery of Shijiazhuang. The three puppet township offices and their affiliated looting teams stationed in the town fled in panic towards Shijiazhuang, and the area was recovered by our forces. A work team composed of cadres from the democratic government entered the town with the army. The masses rose up to denounce the crimes of the Chiang Kai-shek's puppets, and moved back all the grain, utensils, and crops that had been robbed or occupied, and destroyed the enemy's trenches and fortifications. Currently, the masses are launching a revenge and liquidation movement.
Xinhua News Agency, Jinji Luyu, 9th: The militia rotation team of the Third District of Xiuwu County, Northern Henan, cleverly captured more than 40 enemies. On August 27th, the team crossed the Daqing Road and encountered a platoon of the 38th Division of the enemy from Jiaozuo and its escorting health team's Second Squad of 44 people in the area of Zhanggong and Gaotun (both west of Xiuwu City). The enemy asked, "Which unit are you from?" Our militia cleverly replied, "The Self-Defense Force of Qian Dong (an enemy-controlled village); we are here to escort you on your way!" The enemy from Jiaozuo immediately handed over their health team to our militia and hurriedly returned. All 44 members of the enemy's health team and three traitorous bullies who led the way were all captured by our forces.
