    Xinhua News Agency, Hebei-Chahar-Rehe-Liaoning, September 26th: The militia in the suburbs of Beiping and the northeastern Shunyi and Huairou areas have launched extensive guerrilla warfare in the struggle against the "mopping-up" operations of the Jiang-Fu bandit troops. Local "Protect the Fields" teams are bravely fighting with the tactics of "rifles combined with landmines." At the same time, household registrations are constantly being checked in various places, sentry posts are maintained, and pedestrians entering and leaving are strictly inspected. Landmines are laid, villages and roads are blockaded, and communication links are established in certain places where the masses are hidden, connecting the mountain tops, mountain ranges, mountain gullies, and village sentry posts into one. Once, when the enemy invaded from Jiudu River, signals from more than 30 sentry posts were frequently transmitted, covering the transfer of the masses and attacking the enemy's flanks and rear, making the Jiang-Fu army dare not advance easily. On the 13th, when the enemy invaded the first district of Huairou, the "Protect the Fields" team of liberated peasants launched a landmine warfare, killing ten enemies. The enemy fled in panic. The "Protect the Fields" team also captured two Jiang spies and seized an important document. The Shunyi militia fought 11 battles in 20 days from August 4th to 24th, defeating an enemy 20 times our size, killing 4 enemies, capturing 14, capturing 4 Jiang spies, and seizing many other military supplies.
    Xinhua News Agency, Hebei-Chahar-Rehe-Liaoning, September 26th: More than 1,500 bandits from the Tenth Provisional Division of the Jiang-Fu bandits in eastern Chahar, divided into three routes from Chongli, invaded the area north of Chicheng to seize grain. They were defeated by the Zhang (Bei) Bao (Yuan) Detachment of our Hebei-Rehe-Chahar People's Liberation Army, killing more than 40 enemies, capturing 10, and seizing more than 10 light machine guns, submachine guns, rifles, and carbines.
