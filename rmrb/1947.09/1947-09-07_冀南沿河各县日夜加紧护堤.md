(Our newspaper, Southern Hebei, 5th dispatch) Recently, continuous autumn rains have caused river levels to rise, and farmers are intensifying their dyke protection efforts. In Jinxian River, First District of Shen County, breaches occurred at the dangerous sections of Tanglugou, Shelinzhuang, and Xindongguan on the evening of the 15th of last month, submerging more than ten hectares of autumn crops. The district immediately halted all other work, and more than ten thousand people worked day and night on the 16th and 17th, repairing most of the dozens of dangerous sections, with a bank length of ten miles. On the 13th of last month, the Seventh District experienced torrential rain for two days and nights, causing the river to swell rapidly, reaching within a foot of the top of the dyke. Currently, party, government, military, civilian, and militia cadres in the district have halted all other work and are leading the masses to build dykes and block breaches day and night, resolutely fighting against the water. From the 17th to the 19th, the canal in Gucheng rose to more than 1.3 zhang (approximately 4.3 meters), and in the Southwest Township, over 200 mu (approximately 13 hectares) of fields have already been flooded. To avoid emergencies, the county government has ordered all districts to inspect the dykes, and the Fifth District has mobilized over a thousand people to work on the dykes. In Julu, the water level of the Xiaozhang River reached 70%, and villagers along the river are patrolling day and night, guarding and blocking badger and fox burrows. In recent days, the water level of the Fuyang River has risen rapidly, and cadres and the masses in Qi County are intensifying their efforts to guard the embankments. The Hengshui Construction Section has urgently mobilized a thousand workers and has completed the repair of the critical areas along the river. In villages along the river in Ji County, the masses have assigned a mobile sentry within their respective jurisdiction to patrol the river water. The Jize Flood Prevention Committee has divided the county into three types of villages: villages with river embankments are the active dyke-watching villages, villages with larger water intake are the assisting villages, and the remaining villages with little or no flooding are the mobile villages, providing assistance as needed. When the water is about to overflow the river channel, the active villages immediately go to the dykes to watch and concentrate their efforts on guarding the dangerous areas. Each shift builds a mat shed on the dyke to protect against wind and rain, and prepares poles, bags, baskets, spades, etc. to fill leaks in time. During the day, the dyke watching is done in coordination with two-thirds of the elderly and weak, with specific section assignments, and cadres inspect at any time. At night, all able-bodied men go to the dyke to watch, with two people specifically assigned to patrol with lanterns, paying attention to leaks inside and out, with a lamp every three zhang (approximately 10 meters) and a person with a spade every one and a half zhang (approximately 5 meters) for defense.
