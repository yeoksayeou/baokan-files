    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th. According to the Central News Agency: More than 1,700 workers at the Hangzhou Weicheng Silk Reeling Factory went on a complete strike on the 18th. The reason for the strike was that female workers at the factory demanded a 50% increase in wages due to the recent high prices and incomes that could not sustain their lives. However, the factory refused, so they started a partial slowdown on the 17th, which expanded into a full strike the next day. The silk reeling industry is one of the main industries in Hangzhou, and it has been in a deepening crisis due to the influence of bureaucratic capital and inflation in recent years. In April, more than 30,000 silk reeling and machine industry workers in the city were unemployed. Currently, there are only more than 5,000 silk reeling workers in the city, and the Weicheng factory accounts for about two-fifths of them. It is estimated that after the incident, the factory's daily losses will be around 80 million yuan in Chiang currency.

    杭州工人罢工
    【新华社陕北二十日电】据中央社讯：杭州纬成缫丝厂一千七百余工人于十八日全部罢工。起因为该厂女工以近来物价日高，收入无法维持生活，要求厂方增加工资五成，但遭厂方拒绝，遂于十七日开始局部怠工，至次日更扩大为全体罢工。按缫丝业为杭州主要工业之一，年来因受官僚资本与通货膨胀之影响，危机日深，四月间该市缫丝、机器工业工人失业者即达三万以上，目前全市缫丝工人仅有五千余人，纬成厂约占五分之二。据估计此次事件发生后，该厂每日损失约在蒋币八千万元左右。
