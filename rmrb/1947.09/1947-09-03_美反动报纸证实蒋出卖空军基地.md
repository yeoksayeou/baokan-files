Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st. Reports from correspondents of the American Howard newspaper chain confirm the fact that Chiang Kai-shek sold the Chengdu, Xi'an, and Lanzhou air force bases to American imperialism. According to a Central News Agency dispatch from Washington on the 30th, the correspondent cited the remarks of American "air strategists," saying that if a "friendly China (referring to American imperialism's running dog, Chiang Kai-shek) remains in power," then they will allow the United States to use the airfields of Chengdu, Lanzhou, and Xi'an; "However, if the Chinese Communists rule China, then the United States will lose these bases." The American newspaper correspondent concluded: "No matter how 'harsh' Wedemeyer's 'talks' about the 'corruption and incompetence' of the 'Central' (Chiang) government are, the ruthless fact is that the United States will have to deal with the Chiang Kai-shek government, otherwise the United States (referring to American imperialist forces) will have to withdraw from Asia." It is said that American "air strategists" explained this issue as follows: "There are four B-29 airfields built by the United States near Chengdu, two B-24 bases near Lanzhou, and one airstrip near Xi'an." "In case of emergency, the base can also be supplied by air from Shanghai and Guangzhou." The hawkish air strategist妄称称妄称: "If a triangular route from Chengdu, Lanzhou, and Xi'an extends north to Lake Baikal in Siberia, it will cut off the Outer Siberian Railway. B-29 aircraft will use these bases to destroy Soviet transportation connecting Europe and Asia, and divide the Soviet Union into two."

　　美反动报纸证实蒋出卖空军基地
    【新华社陕北一日电】美国霍华德系报纸特派员的报导，证实蒋介石出卖成都、西安、兰州空军基地予美帝国主义的事实。据中央社三十日自华盛顿发专电称，该特派员引证美国“空军战略家”之谈论，说如果一个“友谊的中国（指美帝国主义的走狗蒋介石）仍在掌握大权”，则他们允许美国使用成都、兰州、西安的飞机场；“但是，如果中共统治中国，则美国将失去这些基地”。该美报特派员从而结论称：“不论魏德迈对‘中央’（蒋）政府的‘腐败无能’所做的‘强硬谈话’如何，无情的事实是美国将不得不与蒋介石政府打交道，否则美国（指美帝侵略力量）就要退出亚洲了”。据说美国“空军战略家”对此问题说明如下：“成都附近有四个美国建造的Ｂ２９式飞机场，兰州附近有两个Ｂ２４式基地；西安附近有一个飞机跑道”。“如再发生紧急情况，该基地亦可由上海、广州以空运供应”。该好战的空军战略家妄称：“如由成都、兰州、西安成一三角形的航线向北伸引到西伯利亚的贝加尔湖，则将切断外西伯利亚大铁道，Ｂ２９式机将由这些基地破坏苏联连接欧亚两洲的交通，并将苏联切断为二。”
