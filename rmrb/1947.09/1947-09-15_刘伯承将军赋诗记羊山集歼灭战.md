　　Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains Front, August 10th (Delayed Dispatch) General Liu Bocheng, after crossing the river to launch a counter-offensive and annihilate nine and a half brigades of the Chiang army, gladly composed a poem entitled "Remembering the Battle of Yangshanji," the original text of which is as follows:

　　The victory at Langshan, then Yangshan,
　　Cannons roar, smoke fills the land;
　　Millions of residents clap their hands in glee,
　　Happy to see their sons seize the pass valiantly.

　　The poem is accompanied by a note: "Langshan is where the 32nd and 70th Divisions were annihilated, and Yangshan is where the 66th Division was annihilated; both mountains are located between Juye, Jiaxiang, and Jinxiang. A series of small mountains, like wolves and sheep, run from north to south, as the western remnants of Mount Tai. This liberated area, because it is close to the Xuzhou-Pukou Railway, has seen many people brutally murdered since the Japanese puppet division commander Fang Xianjue attacked and suppressed the area last year; even old men who had shaved their heads restored their queues, and girls who had unbound their feet resumed foot-binding. The people, from their resistance and anger, strengthened their guerrilla warfare, and this time they participated in the war and strove for victory with great enthusiasm."

　　刘伯承将军赋诗记羊山集歼灭战
    【新华社中原前线八月十日电】（迟到）刘伯承将军于渡河反攻歼灭蒋军九个半旅后，欣作“记羊山集战斗”诗一首，原文如下：
    狼山战捷复羊山，
    炮火雷鸣烟雾间；
    千万居民齐拍手，
    欣看子弟夺城关。
    诗末并附记云：“狼山为歼灭三十二师和七十师之处，羊山为歼灭六十六师之处；两山都在钜野、嘉祥、金乡之间，一系列的小山如狼如羊，由北向南行进，为泰山西部之余脉。这一块解放区因其靠近徐州津浦路，自去年降日师长方先觉进攻镇压以来，民众被惨杀者甚众；甚至老头子已剃头者恢复蓄辫子，女孩子已放脚者恢复缠足。民众从其反抗愤怒之中，强化了自己的游击战争，这次参战争取胜利极为踊跃出力。”
