　　Lucheng County Technical Experts Gather
　　Promote Wheat Planting by Sharing Experience
[Report from our newspaper in Lucheng] The county-wide production director and technical committee meeting was held on August 26th, with a total of 341 attendees. During the intensive three-day meeting, the agricultural technology work of the past six months was summarized: Firstly, 78,426 trees were planted during the wheat season, with 44,827 surviving; 64.4 mu of nurseries were cultivated, 71 forbidden mountains were restored, and tree planting techniques and management methods were created. In the fight against drought during sowing, techniques such as using the morning, taking advantage of the sun, borrowing time, spot sowing, cooling and settling, seed deposit, and land exchange were studied to overcome the drought, enabling most to be sown and seedlings to be caught. Water conservancy was also carried out, using water drawing, pumping, and other methods to irrigate 5,827 mu of land. Seed soaking was implemented for 16,700 mu of millet and 39,481 mu of corn. Top dressing was applied to 47,342 mu of corn and 7,638 mu of millet. In weeding, calculation methods were created to break the old ways, implementing the "meeting millet seedling method" and "borrowing security seedling retention" methods. Regarding the promotion and management of improved varieties, 220,225 jin of pure-bred 169 wheat were harvested, and the seed fields of Golden Queen corn were managed. The density of 811 millet was grasped, which was well-received by the masses. Cotton field management was driven by the slogan "Late flowering is indefensible," and management was earnestly carried out to break the idea of looking down on dryland flowers. The promotion of small beans from plains to mountains was expanded by one and a half times compared to last year. A situation of planting seedlings has been opened up, and relying on the insurance of the Technical Committee, everyone dares to plant. Farm tools were created to solve the labor shortage, including the "three five-dou six," the "one-legged replanting plow," the "living ground @," the "flower transplanting hoe," the "hollow hoe," the "weeding hoe," and many other inventions. Many technical committees have also experimented with variety and disease research, achieving considerable success. After two days of summarizing and commendation, county-wide technical heroes were selected. In the discussion on expanding wheat fields, everyone's enthusiasm was even higher. Wei Zihong from Weijiazhuang said: "There are many favorable conditions for planting more wheat this year. There is plenty of autumn rain, and we can definitely seize a good harvest. Planting more wheat can help us get through the lean months before the next summer harvest. Not only can we overcome famine, but we can also support the front lines. This year, we guarantee to expand by 40 percent." Gao Jinzhu from Anchang said: "This year, the masses understand the need to expand wheat fields, but they are worried that the corn and millet will not be harvested in time for the wheat planting." An old technician said: "As long as the ground isn't frozen and there are wheat seeds at home, just plant!" He guaranteed: "He dug ditches last year, delaying the wheat planting and failing to emerge, but this year, he still harvested seven or eight dou per mu." He also said: "This year, my cotton fields will all be converted to wheat." Three methods were studied to solve the fertilizer shortage: First, actively find ways to accumulate fertilizer, cut artemisia, compost manure, collect soil from the kang, scrape wall plaster, collect road mud, and house soil, all of which can become fertilizer, and launch a vigorous fertilizer production movement. Second, subsidize fertilizer by heavily padding the land, "two and a half dan of soil reversed," and using stir-fried sesame, flaxseed, and small mustard seeds on the land to supplement fertilizer. Bean cakes, sesame, and beans are all good, and the method of rubbing seeds with oil can supplement a portion. Third, apply fertilizer reasonably. Because fertilizer is scarce this year, it cannot be applied all over the ground, but must be applied near the seeds to avoid waste. Wang Gengyin from Wuli Hou said: "Spreading manure is not as good as applying manure in a small stream, and applying manure in a small stream is not as good as applying manure in dots." This reduces waste and allows the manure to take effect immediately. Regarding the labor shortage, Liu Changsheng from Fengcun said: "As long as it is well organized, it will be fine. For example, during the spring planting, when all the labor and livestock were transporting grain, the semi-labor force and auxiliary labor force in the family planted the land; now, the autumn harvest for wheat planting is the same. We should rectify the mutual aid teams to successfully complete the expansion of wheat planting." Villages such as Songcun, which were affected by disasters, raised the difficulty of obtaining wheat seeds. Everyone unanimously proposed: "Let's plant the wheat first. Don't worry about not having anything to eat. As long as we produce, we can make a living. Households that don't have wheat seeds can borrow from each other." When discussing the promotion of 169 wheat, Hu Yunzhi from Xiangjing said: "169 wheat can produce more. I harvested one shi and eight dou from one mu." Comrades from Chengguan also said: "169 wheat is planted near the house, so you don't have to worry about small insects eating it." Yang Gou from Nanma said: "It produces a lot, and the flavor is strong. It can withstand small cold rain." Xiao Ming from Beicun said: "Follow the government and plant more 169." After such a heated discussion, each village used precise calculation methods to determine the plan to expand wheat fields. The entire county plans to plant 253,855 mu, accounting for 42.3 percent of the total land area, an increase of 100,000 mu compared to the original wheat fields, and to promote 24,391 mu of 169 wheat, a two-fold increase compared to last year.

　　潞城全县技术功臣集会
  　发扬经验推进种麦
    【本报潞城讯】八月二十六日召开全县生产主任技术委员会议，到会共有三百四十一人，在紧张的三天会议中，总结了半年来的农技工作：首先在麦季植树七万八千四百二十六棵，活了四万四千八百二十七棵，养苗圃六十四点四亩，恢复禁山七十一处，并创造了栽树技术和管理办法。在抗旱下种中，研究用趁晌、就晌、借晌、点种、凉安、寄籽、换地等技术，战胜了旱灾，使大部种上并捉住苗，并兴修水利，用打水，泵水等办法浇地五千八百二十七亩，实行浸种的有谷一万六千七百亩，玉茭三万九千四百八十一亩，上追肥的玉茭四万七千三百四十二亩，谷七千六百三十八亩。在锄苗中创造计算办法，打破老一套，实行上会谷苗法，借安留苗等办法。对推广与管理优良品种，一六九小麦收纯种二十二万零二百二十五斤，金皇后玉茭管理了留种地，八一一谷的远近稀稠掌握得到群众好评。棉田管理用：“晚发花无招架”的口号行动起来，认真管理，打破看不起旱地花的思想。推广小豆往平地到山地，较去年扩大一倍半。已打开了种苗的局面，依靠技委会的保险都敢种了。创造了解决劳力缺乏的农具，三个五斗六，一条腿补种犁，活地＠，移花锄，空心锄，耘锄等很多发明，并有很多技委都试验了品种和病害研究，取得相当大的成就。经过二天时间的总结表功，评选了全评技术功臣。在讨论扩大麦田中，大家情绪更高，魏家庄魏子洪说：“今年多种麦有很多有利条件，秋雨多，保险能大大抓一把，多种麦子能度明夏青黄不接，不但能度灾荒，还要支援前线，今年保证要扩大百分之四十。”安昌高金柱说：“今年扩大麦田，群众思想通，就是玉茭谷子赶不及回茬麦。”一个老技术家说：“地不冻，家有麦籽只管种。”做出保证：“他去年挖沟地赶麦迟了，去年没出来，今年出来一亩地还打了七、八斗”，他并且说：“我今年棉田都要赶成麦。”研究出解决肥料困难的三个办法：第一就是积极想办法积肥、割蒿、沤粪、打炕土、刮墙皮、敛道泥，屋土等都能成肥，开展热烈的造肥运动；第二是补助肥料，要大量垫地，“土倒土二石五”，用炒芝麻，葫麻，小芥籽上地顶粪，豆饼、芝麻，和豆都很好，用油搓籽的办法，都能补助一部分；第三个就是合理施肥，因为今年肥料缺乏，就不能满地上，要上在种籽跟前，免得浪费。五里后王庚寅说：“撒粪一片不如溜粪一钱，溜粪一钱不如点粪一钱”，这样作既减少浪费，又能使粪马上得劲。劳力缺乏问题，冯村刘长盛说：“只要很好组织起来就行，如春天下种时，劳畜力全都运粮走了，家里的半劳力辅助劳力都把地种上了；现在种麦秋收亦是这样，咱们应该很好整顿互助组，胜利完成扩大种麦”。还有宋村等受灾村提出麦籽困难，大家一致提出：“现在先把麦子种上，不要耽心没吃的，只要生产就能糊口，个别没麦籽户实行互借互剂。”讨论推广一六九小麦时，详井胡云只说：“一六九小麦能多打，我种一亩就收了一石八斗”还有城关同志说：“一六九小麦种家边，不怕小虫吃”，南马杨狗说：“打的多，口亦紧，小冷雨砸他亦顶住”，北村小明说：“跟上政府走，多种一六九”。经过这样热烈的讨论，各村都用精确计算的办法，定出了扩大麦田计划，全县要种二十五万三千八百五十五亩，占总土地百分之四十二点三，较原有麦田多增加十万亩，并推扩一六九小麦二万四千三百九十一亩，比去年增加了二倍。（晋祥、连宏、风俊、建德）
