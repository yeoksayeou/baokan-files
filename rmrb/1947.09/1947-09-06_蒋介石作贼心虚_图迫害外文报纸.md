Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th: Chiang Kai-shek, after closing down all liberal newspapers in his controlled areas, is now attempting to further pressure foreign commercial newspapers in Shanghai. According to an Associated Press dispatch from Shanghai on the 29th: The (Chiang) Ministry of Interior secretly ordered the Shanghai Police Bureau to closely monitor "foreign language newspapers that frequently publish criticisms and insults against the (Chiang) government." The Police Bureau "has paid special attention to this matter," and "if these newspapers do not change their tone, they will be forced to cease publication." There are a total of four foreign language newspapers in Shanghai, two of which are Russian newspapers run by Soviet merchants, and the other two are: the American-owned "China Press" and the British-owned "North China Daily News." In addition, there are two foreign language newspapers run by the Kuomintang, namely the "China Forum" and the "Continental Daily News."

Dozens of people were also arrested in Hanyang, and a atmosphere of terror permeated Wuhan.
