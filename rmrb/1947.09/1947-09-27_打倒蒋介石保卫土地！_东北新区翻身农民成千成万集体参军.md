Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 25th: In the Northeast's vast new districts, liberated peasants are joining the Democratic Allied Army in large numbers as the land reform movement deepens. In the Jehol-Chahar area, a surge of enthusiasm for joining the army has been sweeping through the region for three months. In the two county districts near Weichang alone, more than 3,000 people signed up in one month. In Siyun County (newly established county, east of Yanqing in eastern Chahar), the so-called "no-man's land" and the Heihechuan area, which had been occupied by the Chiang-Fu bandits for a long time, had more than 500 young men voluntarily enlisting in the army within three days after the land reform, and swore to the masses: "We will not go home until we destroy Chiang Kai-shek!" Jiao Baoshun, a veteran from Huairou, organized 29 young people to form a "new recruit platoon" to enlist collectively. Zhang Xinkuan, the director of the peasant association in Nan'an Village, also personally led young people to join the army. When Wang Laobao from Xindian Village, Luanping, sent his son to join the army, he repeatedly instructed: "Our family has not had a land deed for three generations, and this time we must protect it." Everywhere, parents sent their sons, wives sent their husbands, and the masses donated money and goods to comfort the families of those who joined the army. In southern Liaoning, more than 10,000 liberated peasants have poured into the Democratic Allied Army. In Xin'an County, after just obtaining land, 400 people went to the front lines. In Fuxian County, 21 young people also went to the front under the leadership of the militia captain. In counties such as Gaiping, Xiuyan, and Haicheng, a large number of young people rode decorated sedan chairs and horses when they went to the troops, and were seen off by tens of thousands of people, who urged them to kill more Chiang bandits and make contributions to the people. Thousands of liberated youth in the new districts of Huanan, Panshi, Yitong, Shuangyang, and Yantongshan marched to the front lines in batches, singing the magnificent and joyful song of "Liberated peasants are in charge of the world, so we join the army to protect it," vowing to fight to completely eliminate "Manchukuo II" and overthrow the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang.

Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 24th: The news of the People's Liberation Army's counter-offensive victory has encouraged the people in the Northeast Liberated Areas, who said: "With fighting inside and outside the pass, Chiang Kai-shek will not live long." Now they are stepping up production to accelerate the end of "Manchukuo II." Following the donation of 230,000 pairs of army shoes by the people of Harbin, Jiamusi has launched a campaign to sew 250,000 sets of cotton clothes for the front-line field army, and has completed 60,000 sets by the end of August. Many models have emerged in the sewing process. An old lady in the third street of the first district sewed 24 sets by herself, and the leader of the women's association group in the sixth street of the second district sewed 30 sets by herself. Both have been praised by the masses. Longjing City in Yanji County organized more than 800 women to dismantle and wash 2,000 sets of cotton clothes for the troops. Workers in state-owned clothing factories in various places are also unanimously processing and rushing to produce winter clothes to ensure the needs of the front line. In recent months, women in urban and rural areas have seized the gap during the autumn harvest to rush to make 60,000 pairs of military shoes, including 30,000 pairs from Heilongjiang and Yilan counties alone, and 6,000 pairs from Yanji.

    【新华社东北二十四日电】人民解放军反攻胜利的消息鼓舞了东北解放区的人民，他们说：“关内关外一齐打，蒋贼活不久了。”现在他们正加紧生产以加速结束“二满洲”。继哈尔滨人民捐献二十三万双劳军鞋后，佳木斯已开展为前线野战军缝制二十五万套棉衣运动，八月底以前已完成六万套。在缝制中出现了不少模范，一区三街老太太一人缝了二十四套，二区六街妇女分会小组长一人缝了三十套。都得到了群众的表扬。延吉县龙井市组织了八百余妇女为部队拆洗了两千套棉衣。各地公营被服厂工人亦一致加工赶制冬衣，保证前线需要。近月来各城乡妇女乘秋收间隙赶制军鞋六万双，其中仅合江、依兰一县即有三万双，延吉有六千双。
