　　Noodle Soup, Pig Iron, Dye Black Cloth
    [This newspaper, Changzhi News] Zhang Guilian, a textile model comrade in the Second District of Changzhi, introduced her method of dyeing black cloth: Save the noodle soup left over from eating noodles, pour it into a vat and add some pig iron. About one bowl of noodle soup to four taels of pig iron. Keep the noodle soup in a cool place and let it rot for ten days or so until it becomes clear water with a layer of grey skin floating on the surface. This counts as indigo. If there is no noodle soup, then use the vermicelli soup from the flour mill. Collect three kinds of plants: *yangpa* seedlings, small black leaves, and star anise leaves. When dyeing, one bowl of noodle soup can dye one foot of cloth. First, use *yangpa* seedlings to apply a base to the cloth (apply one base coat and then rub it in the noodle soup). Three coats will do the trick. There is no need to use black alum. The dyed cloth is black and saves money, and can be worn two more washes. (Zhen Hua)

　　面汤生铁染黑布
    【本报长治讯】长治二区纺织模范张桂莲同志，介绍他创造的染黑布办法：吃面时留下的面汤保存起来，倒在一个缸里再放进些生铁，大约一碗面汤四两生铁，把面汤放在阴凉，烂上十几天，能成了清水，浮面上有一层灰皮，就算成了靛，没有面汤就粉坊的粉条汤也行。采羊耙苗和小黑叶、八角叶三种植物。染时一碗面汤能染一尺布，先将布使羊耙苗打了底（打一遍底在面汤里搓一遍）有三遍就能染好，不用使黑矾，染出布又黑又省钱，能多穿二水。　　　（振华）
