　　Rich from Planting Indigo in Former Zhang, Plant More Wheat
    [Our newspaper, Lucheng News] In the Fourth District, Former Zhang, large-scale organization has begun. They are focusing on intensive cultivation of garden plots, using more fertilizer, putting in more labor, planting specialty products, and seizing the main opportunity, putting forward the slogan "One mu of garden is equal to ten mu of field," and have achieved great results. Farmers are full of praise. The special products planted in the garden plots alone yielded an income of 5,450 *shi* of millet. Of the village's 6,972 *mu* of land, 1,000 *mu* are garden plots, with 380 *mu* planted with indigo. Currently, 450 vats have been processed. Each vat is estimated to yield 50 *jin*, which means a total harvest of 20,250 *jin*. According to the lowest price, averaging two *dou* of millet per *jin* (the market price for good indigo is three and a half *dou* of millet), this translates to 4,050 *shi* of millet. 250 *mu* are planted with tobacco, with an average yield of 140 *jin* per *mu*, totaling 35,000 *jin*. At the market price of 40,000 *yuan* per 100 *jin*, this translates to 1,400 *shi* of millet. The total for both items is 5,450 *shi* of millet. The village has 1,699 people, with an average income of three *shi* and two *dou* of millet per person, exceeding the total output of all the village's dry land. In planting specialty products, applying topdressing fertilizer was crucial, and research on techniques reduced losses. Li Haoqiu applied topdressing fertilizer four times to one *mu* of indigo, with ten cartloads of base fertilizer (pig and sheep manure), 80 *jin* of soybean cake at the time of transplanting, ten loads of liquid manure when planting seedlings, 20 loads of heated soil when surrounding the seedlings, and 60 *jin* of red ramie when it was about to be put into the vat (to capture color and produce indigo). As a result, he harvested 102 *jin*. Indigo with two applications of topdressing fertilizer only yielded 60 *jin* per *mu*, one application yielded 50 *jin*, and no topdressing fertilizer yielded 40 *jin*, and the indigo was of poor quality and could not be sold at a high price. This year, after mobilization, farmers generally applied topdressing fertilizer twice, increasing income by five *jin* per vat. The village processed 450 vats, increasing indigo production by 2,250 *jin*. There has also been progress in indigo processing techniques compared to previous years. The village elected 17 skilled workers and 35 semi-skilled workers, who were uniformly assigned to oversee the vats. 20 skilled and semi-skilled workers were assigned to other counties and villages. Each skilled worker was paired with a semi-skilled worker, combined with a dozen or so people in a group, to oversee four vats, exchange experiences, and mutually study and learn techniques. This year, only two vats of indigo were spoiled in the entire village, a world of difference compared to previous years. Last year, 150 vats of indigo were processed, but only 15 vats could keep up with the demand. Because there were few vats, the indigo came too quickly, resulting in the loss of 50 *mu* of indigo. This year, after discussion and research by cadres and skilled workers, the masses were organized to build 18 new vats. The entire village has enough, and no *mu* was wasted. The farmers are all beaming with joy, saying that planting indigo has brought great fortune. Blacksmith Ren Lianchang, who was liberated and allocated eight *fen* of garden land, planted wheat and harvested three *shi* this year. After harvesting the wheat, he planted indigo and applied a lot of fertilizer, yielding 120 *jin* of indigo. He said, "I'm so grateful for planting indigo, it's better than anything else." Old Tian planted one *mu* and harvested two vats. He said, "There's no problem with paying the rent!" Old Chou, who is over sixty years old and lives alone with one other person, planted one and a half *mu* of indigo and harvested three vats. Two vats were sold for 280,000 *yuan*. He couldn't stop smiling, saying, "What am I going to do with so much money!" He wants to support the front-line troops with 80,000 *yuan* to fight Chiang Kai-shek. Councilor Li Haoqiu said on the street, "Plant indigo, process it well, sell it for more money, and support the front lines. This year, our village has seized the main opportunity and will guarantee an increase of 50 head of livestock." At this time, the cadres immediately seized the opportunity to propose: Seize the main opportunity again, return the garden plots to wheat, and expand the wheat fields to accumulate fertilizer. They explained to the masses, "Don't think that our place has good harvests every year. Other places have poor harvests and hailstorms. Everyone should look at the bigger picture and look further ahead. We still need to save and plant more wheat to increase grain production." Last year, the village planted 983.4 *mu* of wheat, with 172 *mu* being replanted and 811.4 *mu* being newly planted. This year, it will be expanded by 1,341.6 *mu*, for a total of 2,152.6 *mu* of wheat (excluding the 1,000 *mu* of garden plots). Planting wheat saves more labor than planting autumn crops, so the labor can be used in the garden plots to increase grain production. Indigo stalks, chopped and composted, are best for planting wheat. The indigo stalks in the village can fertilize 500 *mu* of wheat land. Promote composting wheat straw and manure, and women and children should collect artemisia, scrape grass, and dig up sludge in large quantities. Each *mu* of wheat land should be fertilized with an average of ten cartloads of manure. In addition to planting oil mustard in the garden plots, plant another 200 *mu* of wheat. Don't leave a single *mu* of land idle, and strive to seize another season's main opportunity well. (Xingfu)

　　故漳种蓝发大财
  　再抓大头多种麦
    【本报潞城讯】四区故漳大规模组织起来，有重点的突击种园地，多上粪，多用工，种特产，抓大头，提出了“一亩园十亩田”的口号，取得了很大的成绩，农民个个称赞。仅园地种特产，即收入小米五千四百五十石。全村六千九百七十二亩土地，有园地一千亩，种小蓝三百八十亩，现已打靛四百五十池，每池按五十斤计，可收二万零二百五十斤，按最低价格，好坏平均二斗小米一斤（市价好靛三斗半米），共折米四千零五十石；种烟叶二百五十亩，每亩平均收一百四十斤，共收三万五千斤，每百斤按市价折洋四万元，共折米一千四百石；两宗共米五千四百五十石。全村一千六百九十九口人，每人平均收入小米三石二斗，超过了全村旱地的总产量。种植特产中，上追粪顶了大事，研究技术又减少了损失。李好秋种一亩小蓝，上了四次追粪，底粪（猪羊粪）十车，栽秧时抓豆饼八十斤，插苗时上灌粪十担，围苗时上炕土二十担，快下池时上红麻生六十斤（能抓色出靛），结果打了一百零二斤，上二次追粪的小蓝，每亩只能打六十斤，上一次打五十斤，不上追粪打四十斤，靛不好，又卖不上大价钱。今年经号召后，一般的上了两次，每池多增加五斤收入，全村打了四百五十池，多增加靛二千二百五十斤，在打靛技术上，也比往年进了一步，全村经大家评选出全把式十七名，半把式三十五名，统一分配看池，往外县外村分配了全半把式二十名。每一个全把式配一个半把式，结合群众十余名为一组，看四个池，交流经验，互相研究学习技术，今年全村才只打坏了两池靛，与往年比较相差天地，去年打了一百五十池靛，才有十五挂池。因池少靛来了赶不急，损失了五十亩小蓝，今年经干部能手研究讨论，组织群众新打池十八挂。全村都够用，没有损夫一亩，农民个个喜洋洋的，都说种小蓝沾了大光。铁匠任连昌，翻身分了八分园地，种草麦今年打了三石，割麦后栽小兰上粪大，打了一百二十斤靛，他说：“我多亏种上小兰，比什么都强”。老田种一亩打了两池，他说：“耕三余一不成问题！”六十多岁的老丑独二口人种一亩五分小兰，打了三池，两池就卖洋二十八万元，他笑的合不住嘴，说：“我卖这么多钱叫怎化哩”！要拥护前方部队八万元打蒋介石。参议员李好秋在大街上说：“种小兰，打好靛，多卖钱，来支援前线，今年咱村抓住了大头，保证增加五十头牲口。”这时，干部即趁热提出：再抓大头，回茬园地，扩大麦田，要把肥积。向群众解释说：“不要看咱这地方年景不歪，别的地方歉收，又遭雹灾，大家眼往大处看远处瞧，还得节约，多种麦子增产粮食。”去年全村种麦九百八十三亩四分，回茬一百七十二亩，还有正茬麦八百一十一亩四分，今年要扩大一千三百四十一亩六分，共种麦二千一百五十二亩六分（园地一千亩不在内），种麦比种秋省工，可以将工用到园地增产粮食。小兰杆切碎沤粪种麦最好，全村小兰杆能上五百亩麦地。发扬沤麦秸粪，妇女儿童大量割蒿、刮草皮、挖污土，每亩麦地要求平均上十车粪。园地除种油芥菜外，再种二百亩草麦。不留一亩白地，争取好好的再抓上一季大头。（兴福）
