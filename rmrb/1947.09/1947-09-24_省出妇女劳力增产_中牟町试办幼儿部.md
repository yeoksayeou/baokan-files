Saving Women's Labor to Increase Production
    Zhongmou Township Trials Nursery

    [Our Newspaper, Southern Hebei, 23rd Dispatch] In the fourth district of Shen County, in order to save women's labor and increase production, Zhongmou Township is piloting a nursery to centrally care for children. The young and middle-aged women of the village are universally participating in agricultural and textile mutual aid groups, implementing a work-point exchange system. However, children are very disruptive and affect production. Comrade Cai Songfang of the village, along with village cadres and school teachers, discussed: How to save women's labor? After everyone's discussion, the school was put in charge of piloting a nursery. Some women were reluctant to leave their children, fearing that the children would fight and cause trouble, and that their own children would be wronged. They felt that it was impossible to manage the children together, that they would cry when hungry and not listen, and that no one but their mothers could manage them. Based on the above ideas, explanations were given, especially emphasizing that organizing the children would save labor, and one person could look after a dozen children. The trial began on June 6th, first by students bringing their younger siblings to school, establishing a captain, an instructor, and six class leaders (four to five in each class), totaling 31 children, aged four to six. Teachers were responsible for teaching them, starting with simple games, learning children's songs, and gathering all the children's toys together for them to play with. They also fed two pairs of rabbits, with the children responsible for feeding them. Praise and rewards were implemented, buying some food and toys, and praising and rewarding those who arrived early and left late, did not fight or curse, and were obedient. Initially, they gathered once a day, played for a while, and then dispersed. Slowly, the children became familiar with each other, and the gathering went from half a day to a full day. After constant consolidation, the children playing together was easier and happier than staying at home with adults. The children learned to write imitations and even recognize simple characters. Since the organization of the nursery, the mutual aid groups have saved a lot of labor. For example, in the Lao Ying ×× group, before, they got up early and went to bed late, and each person could only spin an average of two or three liang of thread per day. Now, each person can spin two more liang of thread per day. According to village statistics, twenty women can spin two more liang of thread per day, and in twenty days, they can spin fifty jin more of thread. From the implementation, the masses' thinking on increasing production has truly been opened up, and many parents who previously did not organize their children are now personally sending them to school.

    省出妇女劳力增产
    中牟町试办幼儿部
    【本报冀南二十三日电】莘县四区，为了节省妇女劳力增产，中牟町试办幼儿部，集中看管儿童。该村青壮妇女普遍的参加农业、纺织互助组，实行了计工换工，但小孩很耽误事，影响生产，该村蔡宋方同志和村干群校教员商讨：如何节省妇女劳动力？经过大家讨论，由群校负责试办幼儿部。有的妇女舍不得离开自己的小孩，怕小孩在一块打架闹气，自己的小孩受屈，感觉小孩在一块办不到，小孩好哭好饿不听说，除去他娘谁也管不了。根据以上思想进行解释，特别说明把小孩组织起来节省劳动力，一个人能看十几个小孩。于六月六日开始试办，先由学生把自己的弟弟、妹妹带进学校里来，设大队长一人、指导员一人、班长六人（每班四人到五人），共计卅一人，年龄是四岁到六岁的，由教员等负责教他们，先做简单游戏、学儿童歌谣，把各家的小孩玩具集中到一块给他们玩耍，喂着两对小家兔，由小孩负责喂养。实行表扬与奖励，买些食物和玩具，按照谁来的早走的晚、不打架不骂人、听话的表扬发奖。起初每天集合一次，玩一会就散，慢慢的小孩混熟了，就集合半晌，再由半晌转整晌到一天。经常巩固起来了，小孩在一块玩，比在家跟着大人又省事还欢乐。小孩学习写仿，还有的学认简单的字。自组织了幼儿部，互助组节省了不少劳力，如劳英××组，以前早起晚睡，每天每人平均才纺二、三两线，现在每天每人能多纺二两线子，全村统计，有二十个妇女每天能多纺二两线子的，二十天可多纺线子五十斤。从实行了真正的打通了群众的增产思想，先前没组织起来的小孩，由大人亲自送到学校里的很多。
