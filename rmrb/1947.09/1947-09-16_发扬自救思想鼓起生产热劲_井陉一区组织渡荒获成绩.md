　　Promote the Spirit of Self-Reliance, Boost Production Enthusiasm:
  　Jingxing First District Organizes Disaster Relief with Achievements
    [Report from this newspaper, Jingxing] Jingxing First District has launched a production self-reliance movement to overcome the disaster. Since spring and summer, the First District has experienced prolonged drought, with ten villages failing to sow seeds. According to statistics, over 18,300 mu of land is barren or yields no grain. In this situation, complex ideological changes have arisen among many people. Some poor peasant households believe that the Eighth Route Army will not let anyone starve and are waiting for relief, preparing to eat from the communal pot. Middle peasants fear borrowing grain, thinking that saving won't benefit them either, so they cook good meals in the dark. Military dependents complain that cadres and the masses are not taking good care of them, their lives are difficult, and they regret that their sons joined the army... Some people in the masses have adopted correct approaches, such as calculating their possessions and actively gathering wild vegetables, while others say that if agriculture doesn't work, they'll engage in sideline occupations. However, these aspects have not been fully promoted. Based on the above situation, the district leadership decided to hold a conference to address the issues. They spent four or five days preparing for the conference, sending district cadres to the villages to understand the specific situation, discover and cultivate positive activists of all types (middle peasants, poor peasants, military dependents, cadres, spinning women, labor heroes), and help summarize preliminary disaster relief experiences in advanced villages such as Shangluoyu. On the 22nd of last month, the district convened a disaster relief conference with over 1,400 people from various systems. Initially, some confused ideas were exposed, but later the focus was on model speeches to educate the general public. For example, emancipated peasant Wang You-tou said, "After the movement, I thought the Eighth Route Army cherished the poor and wouldn't let anyone starve, so I didn't plan my eating and drinking. Later, I felt that relying on that thinking was wrong and that I should be thrifty and plan for the long term. My family now eats three he of grain a day. If there's not enough, we supplement with bran and vegetables. I also want to engage in small business, and my wife spins half a jin of cotton every day. I'm determined to overcome this famine." Old middle peasant Li Fu-ming said, "Before, I didn't understand the policies and was afraid of struggle, so I ate and drank wastefully. After I understood clearly, I regretted it very much. Now my family of eight eats only eight he of grain a day, and I've invested 12,000 yuan in a small cooperative, collecting 6,400 jin of dried wild vegetables." Subsequently, village cadres, labor heroes, model military dependents all successively set out production plans, striving to perform meritorious service for the people. Their slogans are: "Everyone must take action, production comes from self-reliance." "Don't let anyone be idle, don't let any money be idle." "Eat more bran and vegetables, less grain; a steady stream is better than a drought." "If agriculture doesn't work, engage in sideline occupations, and organize many small cooperatives." Although it was only a short one-day conference, most of the attendees clarified their thinking. After returning to their villages, middle peasants persuaded middle peasants, poor peasants persuaded poor peasants, military dependents persuaded military dependents, backward villages learned from advanced villages, and a transformation of negative and pessimistic emotions brewed in every village. In the half-month since then, remarkable achievements have been made, and some disaster relief experiences have been created. Shangluoyu labor hero Zhao Wen-kui, according to the demands of the masses, reformed the small cooperative, implementing a labor-capital combination method. Whoever saw a business opportunity could take money from the cooperative to do it. Those who could carry loads split the profits 50/50, otherwise 30/70. As a result, the number of transporters increased. In that village, 32 people worked in five small cooperatives, earning 125,000 yuan in ten days. This was promoted throughout the district. According to statistics from 20 villages, 44 small cooperatives have been established. It has become the most powerful weapon for the masses to overcome the famine. Furthermore, based on objective conditions and playing to one's strengths, people did whatever they could, "picking up and chopping" everywhere. For example, 30 young and middle-aged people from Qiangtou Village went out to sell their labor, earning back 11 shi and 2 dou of grain. Others carried fruit, sold firewood, and fired tile basins, with many different approaches. It is estimated that over 300,000 jin (dry weight) of wild vegetables have been collected throughout the district. Now the masses have the confidence to overcome the famine, proposing to ensure that no one starves to death, and also to hand in public grain on schedule. (Yong Bin)

　　发扬自救思想鼓起生产热劲
  　井陉一区组织渡荒获成绩
    【本报井陉讯】井陉一区掀起生产自救渡灾荒运动。一区春夏以来，久旱不雨，有十个村始终未下过种。据统计白地与不收粮的地有一万八千三百余亩。在这种情况下，不少人思想上起了复杂的变化。有些贫农户认为八路军不让饿死人，等救济准备吃大锅饭。中农怕借粮，以为节约也落不下，黑夜作好饭吃，军属埋怨干部群众照顾不好，生活困难，后悔自己儿子参军。没米吃两口子吵嘴闹离婚……………………。群众中有不少人采取正确的作法，如计算家当，积极打野菜，还有的说，农业不沾搞副业等。但这些方面，未被充分发扬起来。区领导上根据以上情况，决定开大会解决，会前化了四、五天时间做准备工作，让区干部下乡具体了解情况，发现培养各类型（中农贫农军属干部纺妇劳英）的积极分子，并到上罗峪等前进村帮助总结初步渡荒经验。上月廿二日在区召开了各系统一千四百余人的渡荒大会，开始部分的又暴露些糊涂想法，以后重点就是典型发言，教育一般。如翻身农民王又头说：“运动后我想八路军惜穷人不让饿死人，所以在吃喝上不打算，以后我感觉依靠思想不对，更应当节省长期打算，我家现在一天吃粮三合。吃炒面，不够糠菜补足。我还要搞小商业，我老婆每天纺花半斤，下决心渡这荒年。”旧中农李福明说：“以前我不懂政策怕斗争，浪吃浪喝，以后闹清了很后悔，现在我一家八口一天只吃八合粮，入股小型社一万二千元，采干野菜六千四百斤。”接着各村干部劳英模范军属都相继订出生产计划，争取为民立功，他们的口号是：“人人要动手，生产来自救。”“不让一个人闲，不让一个钱闲。”“多吃糠菜少吃粮，细水长流胜灾荒。”“农业不沾搞副业，大量组织小型社。”虽然短短的一天大会，而出席的人大部分都闹通了思想，回在村里后，中农劝中农，贫农劝贫农，军属劝军属，落后村与先进村要看齐，村村酝酿成一片，转变了消极悲观情绪。到现在半月时间，已取得惊人成绩，并创造了一些渡荒经验，上罗峪劳英赵文魁根据群众要求，改造小型社，实行劳资结合办法。社员谁看见买卖谁就到社里拿钱去干，有膀头出力（即担挑买卖）对半分红，否则三七分红。于是运输的人增加了，该村五个小型社有卅二人干，十天内赚洋十二万五千元。推广全区，据二十个村统计：已成立小型社四十四个。它成为群众渡荒的一个最有力的武器了。并且根据客观条件与发挥一技之长，能干啥就干啥，到处“拾砍”滚动，如前头庄三十个青壮年出外卖工，赚回粮十一石二斗，其它担水果、卖柴、烧瓦盆等花样很多，统计全区已采下野菜三十余万斤（干的），现在群众都有了渡荒信心，提出保证饿不死一个人，还要按期交公粮。（永彬）
