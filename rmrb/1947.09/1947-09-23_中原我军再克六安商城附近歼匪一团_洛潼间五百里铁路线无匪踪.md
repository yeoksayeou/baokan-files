Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains Front, 21st: A unit of Liu Deng's army liberated Lu'an County for the second time on the 17th, killing or wounding dozens of Chiang bandits, capturing more than 30 people, liberating 43 impoverished masses who had been arrested by the bandits, and seizing one mortar, two machine guns, more than 80 rifles, and other materials.

Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains Front, 21st: On the 19th, a unit of Liu Deng's army annihilated a regiment (estimated at about 2,000 men) of the Chiang bandit 58th Division near Shangcheng. The 29th Regiment of the Chiang bandit 58th Division, after occupying Shangcheng, scurried towards Zhongpu, 30 li west of the city, and its northwest area on the 17th. A unit of our army launched a fierce attack on the bandits on the evening of the 18th, and by dusk on the 19th, forced all the bandits into Tianpu, then stormed the town, annihilating all the bandits after several hours of fighting. According to incomplete statistics, more than 400 bandits were killed or wounded, more than 1,200 officers and soldiers were captured, six mortars, ten 60mm mortars, 75 light and heavy machine guns, more than 400 rifles, and other military supplies were seized. Another unit of our army attacked and intercepted the bandit army around Shangcheng, killing, wounding, and capturing more than 300 people, and seizing more than ten machine guns and more than one hundred rifles.

Xinhua News Agency, Western Henan Front, 21st: During the battle to liberate Lingbao, the 5th company of the 2nd battalion of the 11th Artillery Regiment directly under the Chiang bandit National Defense Ministry, from the company commander to the drivers, handed over four German-style 10.5 cm howitzers along with eight ten-wheeled trucks to the People's Liberation Army. Company Commander Hu Zhenying said, "Jiang Gongying, the youth army brigade commander, ordered me to destroy the artillery, but I didn't." These liberated soldiers earnestly requested to join the Liberation Army and defeat the Chiang bandits as soon as possible. More than a dozen artillerymen immediately took the artillery and cooperated with the Liberation Army to capture Shan County after their liberation, exerting great power and winning the praise of the commanders and fighters of the Liberation Army. Driver Li Ziwei said, "When we worked over there (referring to the Chiang bandits), we were hired laborers; now we are back home working for ourselves." Another driver, Huang Jiaqin, who was scattered during the battle of Lingbao, learned the location of the unit after its liberation and hurried back to the team with his assistant, Sun Zhidong, holding the keys in his hand and saying, "If I don't come, the truck won't start, so I'm very anxious."

Xinhua News Agency, Western Henan Front, 21st: Shan County, which was heavily defended by the Chiang bandits with heavy troops, was captured by the Liberation Army after only three hours of fighting. After our army occupied the outposts of the city on the evening of the 16th, we launched a general offensive at 7 p.m. on the 17th. After 40 minutes of fierce artillery fire, we wedged into the city from the city gate and quickly ended the battle by eliminating the Chiang bandit 135th Brigade and other units defending the city after three hours. This city is the tenth county town liberated after our army crossed south. Now we are pressing towards Luoyang in the east and Tongguan in the west, and there are no traces of Chiang bandits along the 500-li railway line.
