　　Wen County, a New District, Achieves Results in Reorganizing Finances
    [This newspaper, Wen County news] The Sixth District of Wen County, in order to alleviate the burden on the people, all cadres paid attention to reorganizing financial work, carrying it out in conjunction with mass movements, and have now achieved considerable results. In eleven administrative villages, including Southeast Leng and North-South Xu Bao, 47,800 jin of public grain wheat and 3,840 jin of millet have been cleared out, and preliminary experience has been gained: (1) Clarify the importance of this work and combine it with the central task. The cadres thought while still in the mountains that the enemy, that dog of a thing, would never be able to use up all the public grain. After returning, they would definitely recover it to supply the military or distribute it to the poor. (2) Leaders personally take action, patiently visit and conduct investigations. For example, North Xu Village was initially thought to be the location of the township government, so there would definitely be no public grain, but after District Chief Cheng's personal visits and investigations, 3,300 jin of wheat were found. (3) Conduct propaganda and education at all times and places to resolve the ideological concerns of the masses. At that time, it was understood that the masses mainly had two concerns. The first was fear of a change in the political situation. Before Qinyang was liberated, many people were willing to report but feared implicating the villagers. They would say things like, "Releasing public grain is not just for my household. If I report it, it doesn't matter if the enemy comes and kills me, but it will cause trouble for the village, and we can't withstand it," etc. The second was fear of unclear accounts. They were afraid that the government would settle old scores after calculating how much was originally released and how much is currently stored, so they all had a wait-and-see attitude. The government expressed its attitude that old accounts would not be settled, and that self-reporting of public grain would be rewarded and credited, dispelling their concerns. (4) Timely commendation and criticism. When some villages and households began to self-report, the district cadres immediately seized the opportunity to commend them everywhere, and as a result, everyone self-reported, and some even went to the district to report in person. (5) Through activists in the mass movement, a mass-based mutual supervision and self-reporting system was formed. (Zhipeng)

　　整理新区财政温县有了成绩
    【本报温县讯】温县六区为减轻民负，全体干部注意整理财政工作，在群运中结合进行，现已收到不少成绩。在东南冷、南北徐保等十一个行政村，已清理出公粮小麦四万七千八百斤，小米三千八百四十斤，并获得初步经验：（一）明确这工作的重要性，结合中心工作来稿。干部们还在山上时就想，敌人狗日绝不会把公粮搞完，回去一定搞出来供给军需或分给穷人。（二）领导亲自动手，耐心访问，调查研究。如北徐村起初大家认为是住乡公所地方，一定没公粮啦，但经过程区长的亲自访问调查，结果搞出麦子三千三百斤。（三）随时随地宣传教育，解决群众思想顾虑。当时了解了群众主要有两种顾虑，首先是怕变天，在沁阳没解放时，许多人是愿报怕连累了村里人，如说：“放公粮不是我一户，我一报，敌来杀了我不要紧，还给村闯祸，咱可抵不住”等。其次是怕算不清帐，原来放多少现存多少，怕政府算后帐，都有等等看思想。政府表示态度不算旧帐，自报公粮要奖励记功，打破了顾虑。（四）及时表扬与批评。开始有些村户自报，区干部就抓紧到处表扬，结果都自报出来了，甚至有的亲自到区上去报。（五）通过群运中积极分子，形成群众性互相监督自报。（志鹏）
