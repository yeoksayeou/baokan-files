　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th: Under the victorious counter-offensive situation of the People's Liberation Army, the Chiang bandit currency continues to plummet, and prices are soaring like a kite with a broken string. According to a Reuters dispatch from Shanghai, the prices of rice, other daily necessities, and foreign securities in Shanghai have all reached new highs. The price of rice broke the 600,000 yuan per dan mark on the 12th, a sharp increase of 50% compared to the 400,000 yuan per dan before the foreign exchange adjustment. The severity of the situation has forced the Shanghai Chiang authorities to order a ban on the export of rice and other grains from Shanghai. During this period, foreign securities rose by an average of 30% compared to last week's market price. For example, cotton mill securities, which were worth 83,000 yuan (Chiang currency) last week, are now priced at 107,000 yuan, and hardware securities have also soared. One of the triggers for the continued rapid rise in prices in Shanghai is that the Chiang government's foreign exchange fund is approaching a crisis. According to Reuters, the Chiang Kai-shek Central Bank raised the benchmark exchange rate for the US dollar to 40,500 yuan on the 11th, from 40,000 yuan previously. Last week, the Chiang Kai-shek Central Bank also announced that it would control certain foreign securities.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th: Chiang Kai-shek's economic crisis is sinking into an increasingly desperate situation. After the Chiang government announced the "Economic Emergency Measures Plan" in February this year without effect, it announced the "Economic Reform Plan" in early August in an attempt to struggle. However, even the Tianjin Ta Kung Pao, affiliated with the Kuomintang political and academic circles, published an article on August 24 pointing out that the Chiang government's plan on paper would not be able to save its economic crisis. The fact that prices in the Chiang-controlled areas had risen from 20,000 times to 50,000 times within half a year after the "Economic Emergency Measures Plan" was announced in February this year is clear evidence. This time, the "Reform Plan" has been revamped, focusing on "establishing county banks" and "rewarding agriculture." The article pointed out that rewarding agriculture is just inviting someone to "play the supporting role." The article said: "Just imagine that farmers are already out of breath under the oppression of compulsory grain purchase and borrowing, so what construction can be talked about?" The article also revealed that the real function of the "Economic Reform Plan," like the "Economic Emergency Measures Plan," is to create opportunities for privileged people to make a fortune. The "gold policy" in the "Emergency Measures Plan" enabled "gold to flow into the hands of wealthy families, bureaucrats, and profiteers," and "price management is a tool for corrupt officials to make money." The establishment of county banks, which is emphasized in the "Economic Reform Plan," does not use its funds for agricultural production at all, but instead takes them to big cities for hoarding activities. "Production loans" are also "mostly seized by wealthy families and bureaucrats and used for hoarding." The article concluded by saying: "The Economic Reform Plan" means that more and more inflation will create a greater economic crisis, and strongly stated: "The deep impression we get from this plan is that the (Chiang) government will no longer talk about balancing the budget in the future, and will continue to move forward with inflation, catching up (meaning catching up with prices), because the (Chiang) government has discovered that the disease of our (referring to the Chiang-controlled area) economy lies in insufficient production, and the reason for insufficient production is actually due to insufficient financial nourishment. This plan is a lighthouse of credit expansion, and we are all waiting for the light (referring to soaring prices)!"

　　人民解放军反攻声威震慑下
  　蒋匪币值再度惨跌
  　上海米价突破六十万大关
    【新华社陕北十三日电】在人民解放军胜利反攻形势下，蒋匪币值继续惨跌，物价有如断线风筝，飞腾不已。据路透社沪电报导，上海的大米、其他日用必需品以及外国证券价格均作新的高涨。米价于十二日突破每担六十万元之大关，较外汇调整前每担四十万元已暴涨了百分之五十。形势之严重，已迫使上海蒋当局下令禁止大米及其他粮食由上海出口。在此期间，外国证券比上周市价平均上涨百分之三十，恰和纱厂证券上周价值八万三千元（蒋币），现已定价为十万七千元，五金证券也猛涨。上海物价继续急骤上涨的导火线之一为蒋政府外汇基金已迫近危机，据路透社称：蒋记中央银行于十一日提高美汇基准价至四万零五百元，前此为四万元，上周蒋记中央银行并宣布将控制某种外国证券。
    【新华社陕北十三日电】蒋介石经济危机愈陷绝境，蒋政府继自今年二月公布“经济紧急措施方案无效后，又于八月初公布‘经济改革方案’以图挣扎。”但连国民党政学系的天津大公报亦于八月二十四日对此载文，指出蒋政府的纸上方案将不能挽救其经济危机。今年二月公布“经济紧急措施方案”后不及半年，蒋区物价已由二万倍涨至五万倍就是明证。此次之“改革方案花样翻新，将其重点改为“设立县银行”“奖励农业”等。该文指出，奖励农业，这不过请来做“陪客”而已。该文说：“试想在征实征借压迫下的农民，已喘不过气来，尚何建设之可言？”该文并泄露“经济改革方案”与“经济紧急措施方案”一样，其真正作用是为特权者制造发财机会，“紧急措施方案”中的“黄金政策”使“黄金流入豪门、官僚、奸商之手”，“物价管理，为贪官污吏用财的利器品。”“经济改革方案”所着重的设立县银行，其资金根本不用于农业生产，而是拿到大城市作囤积勾当。“生产贷款”亦“多为豪门官僚攫取，用于囤积居奇。”该文于结语中表示：“经济改革方案，”意味着更无限的通货膨胀将造成更大的经济危机，力称：“我们从这个方案中得到的深刻印象，那就是（蒋）政府今后不再侈谈平衡预算，对于通货膨胀将要继续前进，迎头赶上（按意即赶上物价），因为（蒋）政府已经发现我们（指蒋区）经济的病症在生产不足，而生产之所以不足，实由于金融之不够滋养，这个方案是信用膨胀的灯塔，我们大家等待光明（按指物价飞涨）吧！”
