Talking about Promoting Strengths and Criticism
    Bing Ru
    In the typical news reports of the Border Region’s Cultural and Educational Awards, many comrades have universally grasped the method of promoting strengths. It greatly promoted the creativity of the masses, allowing readers to clearly see "what to advocate and what to oppose" from the news reports! In the social reforms and production construction movements carried out by the broad masses after liberation, the people's creativity is abundant. We do not adopt the method of criticism and suppression to advance our work, but pay attention to using Chairman Mao's line of praising strengths.
    Start by promoting the positive, and promote the movement forward by praising typical examples. Village cadres in Licheng District, Taihang, have universally mastered this method to promote their work.
    The widespread development of "blackboard newspapers" in the People's Army, like bamboo shoots after a rain, to carry out the "remember the good" and "learn the good" movements, gives us new inspiration. The reporting method of promoting strengths should become a method that journalists strive to practice. Our reporters and correspondents should change their "imperial envoy" attitude in interviews, "open their eyes to see the strengths," and observe problems comprehensively and deeply. Not only see the shortcomings in the negative aspects, but more importantly, see the positive strengths. Even those that are small should be highlighted and promoted. We should only sing praises for the people's creativity; for the people's shortcomings, except for those who are different elements, we should not make negative criticisms, but should overcome the bad by promoting the good. Treat yourself as a servant of the people, "find the good," "remember the good," praise the achievements, and promote the creativity of the masses.
    This year, when the land reform turned into the large-scale production movement, many news reports were entangled in the peasants' negative "cutting the leeks" fear of getting rich mentality. Correspondents Liu Cun and other comrades conducted in-depth investigations and analyses among the masses and wrote to tell us that the basic requirement of peasants after the land reform is to actively become rich. The "cutting the leeks" fear of getting rich mentality is a negative, secondary thought caused by some middle peasants in the implementation of policies. They concentrated on reporting the masses' thoughts of getting rich and praised Liang Madou, a hero who turned over and led the masses to get rich, pushing this year's large-scale production movement a step forward.
    So, in news reports, can we mention both the promotion of strengths and the criticism of shortcomings at the same time? According to the experience of the Jiluyu Seventh Prefectural Committee's leadership method of "launching meritorious service and setting up models," mentioning "investigating the style" and "establishing meritorious service" at the same time cannot achieve the purpose of transforming the style and improving work enthusiasm. Later, when the method of establishing meritorious service and setting up models was proposed, the masses said that the leadership had opened both eyes. In our news guiding concepts, there are still many comrades who put praise and criticism side by side, or inappropriately emphasize the role of criticism, without clarifying the object, only picking on shortcomings, resulting in inaccurate criticism and inappropriate proportions; even exaggerating the shortcomings of the people's team, treating criticism as an attack, which has aroused reader dissatisfaction. Many facts have proven that simple criticism makes it difficult to convince people and achieve the purpose of improving work. On the contrary, starting from promoting strengths, introducing successful work experience, and establishing model banners can guide the masses to learn from the heroes and models. Those with "bad symptoms" will consciously correct their mistakes and overcome their shortcomings from recognizing their merits. For example, "Cadres and the masses of Zuoquan Chengguan unite to squeeze out feudalism" and "Nanweiquan digs air-raid shelters" both adopted the method of comparing progress and praising strengths, combining "self-reporting of praise" with "rewarding with real objects," which encouraged the masses to separate from the landlords and raised the class consciousness of the "backward" masses, which is the best proof.
    Does this approach mean that "the Kitchen God goes to heaven, only saying good things and not bad things"? Or can some areas use this as an excuse, saying that the work in our area is "backward" and there is nothing to report? Turning into a "news dead corner" and simply not saying anything good or bad? We believe that in the method of focusing on praising strengths, criticism is not eliminated. We affirm certain strengths in the movement, which relatively criticizes certain shortcomings or insufficient aspects. It enables people to gain inspiration and education from contrasting facts to make choices. For general issues with universality and principle, we advocate praise, not simply saying good things. Criticism can be raised for what is truly unhelpful to the work and the people, especially for the enemies of the people and their allies. We should have clear love and hate, and resolutely carry out criticism and struggle. We should also resolutely criticize and expose the influence of the landlord's position and hostile class ideology in the people's team, as well as the landlord class's "air-raid shelters." In the past, we have not done enough to openly expose the ideological behavior of hostile classes. This kind of open criticism is not an attack, but education. As for saying that because the development of work is unbalanced, one admits that one is "backward" and there is nothing to report (?), this is a lack of understanding. Any work is developed and improved from the existing foundation. We should learn the "find the good" and "remember the good" methods of the blackboard newspaper, and still be able to promote the budding creativity of the masses from different regions and different working conditions. That is to say, instead of passively waiting for typical successful things to report, we should excavate the creativity of the masses at any time according to the current level of the masses to promote general progress. In addition, any backwardness in work performance must have problems that hinder the progress of the work. If we can go deep into the masses and firmly explore the real needs of the peasants (especially the poor peasants and hired peasants), we can definitely reflect very valuable problems. Saying that there is nothing to report is a manifestation of a lack of seeking truth from facts and a lack of in-depth understanding of the problem. As long as we often pay attention to promoting the creativity of the masses and conduct in-depth practical investigation and research, it can provide us with a rich source of news reports.

### 谈发扬优点与批评

　　谈发扬优点与批评
    冰如
    在边区文教奖金的典型新闻报导中，许多同志，普遍掌握了发扬优点的方法。大大的发扬了群众的创造，使读者从新闻报导中，明确看出报纸在“提倡什么和反对什么”？！在翻身后广大人民所进行的社会改革与生产建设运动中，人民的创造是丰富的。我们不是采取批评打击的方法来推进工作，注意运用了毛主席表扬优点的路线。
    从发扬积极沉着手，表扬典型范例来推动运动前进。太行黎城区村干部均已普遍掌握这种方法推动工作。
    从最近人民军队中有如雨后春笋一样生长的“门板报”普遍开展“记好”“学好”运动，给予我们新的启示。发扬优点的报导方法，应成为新闻工作者努力实践的方法，我们的记者通讯员同志在采访中，要改变“钦差大臣”态度，“睁开看优点的眼睛”，深入实际全面的观察问题。不光看到消极方面的缺点，更重要的是要看到积极的优点。那些虽然是微小的也应把优点突出发扬，我们对于人民的创造，是只应歌颂表扬；对于人民的缺点，除异己分子外，不应作消极的批评，而应从发扬好的去克服坏的。把自己当作人民的勤务员去为群众“找好”“记好”表扬功绩，发扬群众的创造。
    今年由土地改革转入大生产运动时，许多通讯报导多纠缠于农民消极的“割韭菜”怕富思想，通讯员柳村等同志深入群众调查分析，写信告诉我们，土改后农民基本要求是积极发家致富。“割韭菜”怕富思想，是一部分中农在执行政策中所引起的消极的附属的次要的思想。他们集中的报导了群众发家致富思想，表扬了翻身英雄梁马斗领导群众发家致富的模范功臣，把今年大生产运动向前推进一步。
    那么在新闻报导上是否可把表扬优点与批评缺点同时并提呢？根据冀鲁豫七地委“开展立功表模”领导方法经验证明，把“查风”“立功”同时并提，是不能够达到改造作风、提高工作积极性目的的。以后提出立功表模方法，群众才说，领导上睁开了两只眼睛。我们在新闻指导观念上，还有不少同志，把表扬与批评并列，或者不适当的强调了批评的作用，没弄清对象，光挑剔缺点，以致批评失实，分寸不当；甚而夸大人民队伍的缺点，把批评当作攻击，曾引起读者不满。许多事实已经证明，单纯的批评，很难使人心悦诚服，达到改进工作的目的。相反的从发扬优点出发，介绍成功的工作经验，树立模范旗帜，引导群众向英雄模范学习看齐。使有“败症”的人会从认识功劳中自觉的改正错误克服缺点。如左权城关“干群团结挤封建”，“南委泉挖防空洞”，都是采取比进步表扬优点方法，把“表扬自报”与“奖励实物”结合，鼓励了群众与地主分家，提高了“落后”群众的阶级觉悟，便是最好的证明。
    这样作法，是否“灶王爷上天，只说好的不说坏的”呢？或者某些地区可以此为借口，我区工作“落后”，没有什么可供报导？变成“新闻死角”干脆好坏都不说呢？我们认为在以表扬优点为主方法中并非取消批评。我们从运动中肯定了某些优点，即相对的批评了某些缺点或不够的地方。使人从对比的事实中得到启示教育，以决择取舍。对于一般带有普遍性原则问题，我们提倡表扬，并非单纯的说好，真正对工作对人民无益，是可以提出批评的，特别是对于人民的敌人和同盟者，我们应该爱憎分明，坚决进行批评和斗争，对于人民队伍中地主立场和敌对阶级思想影响，以及地主阶级的“防空洞”，我们也应该予以坚决的批评揭露的。以往我们对于敌对阶级思想行为的公开揭露是不够的，这种公开批评不是打击，而是教育。至于说因工作发展不平衡，就自认“落后”，无可报导（？），这是不了解，任何工作都是从现有基础上发展提高的。我们应学习门板报“找好”“记好”方法，从不同地区不同工作条件上仍然可以发扬群众的萌芽创造的。这就是说，不是消极的等着有了典型成功的东西才报导，而是依据群众现有水平，随时发掘群众的创造，以推动一般前进。另外，凡工作表现落后，必然有阻碍工作前进的问题，如能深入群众，抓紧发掘出农民（特别是贫雇农）的真正要求，一定可以反映出很有价值的问题。说无可报导那是缺乏事实求是，抓问题不够深入的表现，只要我们经常注意发扬群众的创造，深入实际调查研究，是能给我们新闻报导以丰富源泉的。
