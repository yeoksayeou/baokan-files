Xinhua News Agency, Yu-Wan-Su, 10th. To coordinate with the counter-offensive operations of the Liu, Deng, Chen, and Xie armies in the Dabie Mountains and Funiu Mountain areas, our Yu-Wan-Su Military Region's main force launched a fierce attack on Huaiyang City, the location of the Chiang bandit's 7th Administrative Inspectorate of Henan Province, on the evening of the 7th. After two days and one night of fierce fighting, the city was captured, annihilating the enemy's remnants, including the People's Training Corps of the 7th Administrative Inspectorate of Henan Province, the Huaiyang Security Regiment, the Huai, Tai, Lu, and Zhe four-county joint defense self-defense force, and the Taikang Security Regiment. The enemy captured included Wang Chengzhang, deputy commander of the 7th District Security of Henan, Zhang Shaojiu, magistrate of Huaiyang County, Wang Bolong (a notorious local tyrant), secretary-general of the Kuomintang County Party Committee, and Lu Ruiyu, speaker of the county council, totaling one thousand and fifty people. Over 170 enemies were killed, wounded, or drowned. The captured included four mortars, one heavy machine gun, twenty-two light machine guns, one thousand and seven rifles and carbines, over 20,000 rounds of ammunition, eleven mules and horses, three radio stations, eight telephones, and many other supplies, which are currently being inventoried.

Note: After our Liu and Deng's army went south, the enemy successively used approximately sixteen brigades of troops, including the reorganized 10th Division, 40th Division, 7th Division, 48th Division, reorganized 3rd Division, 58th Division, 65th Division, and 1st Cavalry Brigade, to trail our army through the Yu-Wan-Su liberated areas. However, our military region's troops and people's armed forces everywhere obstructed and flanked them, completing the task of delaying the enemy's movements and facilitating the smooth southward march of our Liu and Deng army. Currently, within the Yu-Wan-Su area, apart from the enemy's 58th Division and one regiment of the 10th Brigade in Yongcheng, one regiment of the enemy's 206th Division and the guard regiment of the Zhengzhou Command Post in Xuchang, and the enemy's 1st Cavalry Brigade stationed near Zhoujiakou, due to the Chiang bandits' fundamental weakness of insufficient troops, the vast majority of Chiang-occupied towns and cities are only guarded by the Traffic Police Corps and local militias, making them extremely vulnerable. Our army is taking the opportunity to concentrate its main force and local corps and guerrillas to proactively launch offensives against the enemy, achieving repeated victories. This is not only beneficial to the development of the Yu-Wan-Su liberated areas, but also has an important strategic coordinating effect on the operations of our southward expeditionary forces.

Xinhua News Agency, Yu-Wan-Su, 11th. Our local corps and guerrilla units, in order to coordinate with the main force's operations and strike at the Chiang bandit's local troops, are launching attacks in all directions, dealing blows to the enemy who are invading and entrenched in various villages and towns, achieving repeated victories in recent days.

(1) On the 8th of this month, over a hundred men from the Chiang bandit's local forces under Wang Kerong in Ju County surrounded Zhang Shensi (35 li southwest of Ju County). Upon hearing this, our Ju County Battalion immediately rushed to the area, pursuing the retreating enemy, killing and wounding over ten enemies, capturing two alive, seizing one light machine gun, four rifles, and some ammunition. We suffered no casualties. (2) On the same day, our 3rd Sub-district local corps proactively attacked the enemy's Xiaohoupin stronghold northwest of Mengcheng (east of Caoshi Market). After twenty minutes of fierce fighting, the enemy's Mengcheng Suppression Brigade was mostly annihilated, capturing eighty-six enemies, killing and wounding seven enemies, seizing two light machine guns, forty-one rifles, and some other supplies. We suffered no casualties. (3) On the 9th of this month, over three hundred men from the Chiang bandit's local forces under Xie Jingbo in Luyi County infiltrated Yanghetan south of the city, and were immediately defeated by our local forces, fleeing back to Luyi in disarray. Our army captured twenty-four enemies, killed and wounded fifteen enemies, seized four light machine guns, and over sixty rifles. We only had five wounded and one dead. (4) On the 10th of this month, our 2nd Sub-district local corps launched a fierce attack on the Chiang bandit Duan Jingqi, who was entrenched in villages around the Makeng area northeast of Taihe and Guangwumiao (northwest of Taihe). After one hour of fierce fighting, the enemy was defeated, capturing over seventy bandits including company commanders and below, killing and wounding over ten company commanders and below, seizing ten rifles, three grenade launchers, and some supplies. We suffered no casualties.

　　配合刘邓陈谢大军反攻
  　豫皖苏攻克淮阳城
  　擒蒋匪保安司令等千余
    【新华社豫皖苏十日电】我豫皖苏军区主力为配合刘、邓、陈、谢反攻大军在大别山、伏牛山区的作战，七日晚起向蒋匪河南第七专署所在地之淮阳城发动猛攻，经两日一夜之激战，已将该城攻克，歼灭守敌河南第七专署人民集训总队，淮阳保安团，淮、太、鹿、柘四县联防自卫队、太康保安团等残部，俘河南第七区保安副司令王成章、淮阳县长张绍九、国民党县党部书记长王伯龙（当地著名恶霸）、县参议会议长鲁瑞玉以下一千零五十人，毙伤及淹死敌一百七十余人。缴迫击炮四门，重机枪一挺，轻机枪二十二挺，步马枪一千零七支，弹药二万余发，骡马十一匹，电台三部，电话机八部，其他物资甚多，正清查中。
    按：自我刘邓大军南下之后，敌曾先后以整十师、四十师、七师、四十八师、整三师、五十八师、六十五师、骑一旅等部约十六个旅兵力，经过豫皖苏解放区尾追我军，但沿途我军区部队人民武装，到处予以阻击、侧击，完成了滞留敌人行动，便利我刘邓大军顺利南征之任务。现豫皖苏境内除永城尚有敌五十八师，亲十旅一个团，许昌尚有敌二○六师一个团、郑州指挥所警卫团，周家口附近尚有敌骑一旅驻守外，由于蒋匪兵力不足的基本弱点，广大蒋占城镇仅由交警总队及地方团队驻守，异常空虚，我军乘机集结主力与地方兵团、游击队主动向敌发动攻势，迭获胜利，不仅有利豫皖苏解放区的发展，且对我南征部队的作战上，亦有重要的战略性的配合作用。
    【新华社豫皖苏十一日电】我各地方兵团游击部队，为配合主力作战，打击蒋匪地方部队，正四面八方纷纷出击，予出犯及盘据各村镇之敌以打击，数日来迭获胜利。
    （一）本月八日，雎县蒋匪地方部队王克荣部百余人，包围张申司（雎县西南三十五里）。我雎县大队闻讯，立即赶赴该地，追击退走之敌，毙伤敌十余人，生俘二名，缴轻机枪一挺，步枪四支，弹药一部，我无伤亡。（二）同日，我三分区地方兵团主动袭击敌蒙城西北之小侯聘据点（在曹市集以东），经二十分钟激战，将敌蒙城清剿大队大部歼灭，俘敌八十六人，毙伤敌七人，缴轻机枪二挺，步枪四十一支，其他物资一部，我无伤亡。（三）本月九日，鹿邑蒋匪地方部队谢景波部三百余，窜犯城南杨河滩，当即为我地方部队击溃，狼狈窜回鹿邑，计我军俘敌二十四人，毙伤敌十五人，缴轻机枪四挺，步枪六十余支，我仅伤五人亡一人。（四）本月十日，我二分区地方兵团向盘踞太和、光武庙（太和西北）东北之马坑一带村庄之蒋匪段敬齐发动猛攻，经一小时激战，将敌击溃，俘匪中队长以下七十余人，毙伤中队长以下十余人，缴步枪十支，掷弹筒三个，物资一部，我无伤亡。
