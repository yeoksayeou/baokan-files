[Reported from Taiyue on the 14th of this month] The Taiyue Military Commission Headquarters today issued an urgent call to all district militiamen: "Bring out all your strength and throw yourselves into the comprehensive counter-offensive!" The call began by saying: The comprehensive counter-offensive that we have been eagerly awaiting has finally arrived. On the one hand, we feel extremely joyful and excited, and on the other hand, we feel that our task has become even more glorious and important. Therefore, we must bring out all our strength and throw ourselves into the comprehensive counter-offensive. It then put forward several requirements: 1. Intensify the siege of the enemy strongholds of Yuncheng, Anyi, Linfen and other “white spots” in our district, use landmines to blockade them, and then further eliminate them. 2. Step up the reorganization and construction of field companies. With the continuous victories of the comprehensive counter-offensive, the area is expanding day by day, thus requiring a greater number and stronger quality of field companies to go on expeditions at any time. Therefore, we must seize the opportunity to reorganize and extract as much time as possible to carry out necessary military training and political work construction. 3. The border areas need to protect the autumn harvest and protect the able-bodied men. Protecting one able-bodied man and one grain of grain is increasing our strength for the counter-offensive. 4. In the situation of the comprehensive counter-offensive, the main force of the army will have to fight out in large numbers; the task of suppressing landlords, special agents, and local bullies, protecting the interests of the peasants, and maintaining revolutionary order needs to be undertaken by ourselves. We must carry out the struggle for emancipation on the one hand, and arm ourselves to protect the interests of emancipation on the other.

[Reported from Taiyue on the 11th of this month] The militiamen of Jingsheng, Lingshi, bravely broke through from a regiment's encirclement. At dawn on August 25th, the Jingsheng militiamen were surrounded by a regiment of Yan's army. Although the enemy was superior in number and we were inferior, our militiamen were determined and brave, holding the determination to rather die than be captured. Under the enemy's fierce artillery fire, they finally bravely broke through the encirclement. After rushing out of Dazhai Gully, some people were afraid of encountering the enemy again on the Qin Village Plateau and advocated concealment. Comrades Geng Geng and others proposed: "Rather die in battle on the plateau than be crushed to death by the enemy in the gully! We must resolutely rush up!" Everyone responded in unison and rushed to the plateau in one breath, escaping safely. Comrade Ma Si'hai took the lead in carrying the colored flag to break through, demonstrating a high degree of class friendship. The district command specially issued a notice commending this resolute and courageous action and recorded merits and good deeds separately.

　　太岳武总紧急号召全区民兵
  　加紧围困敌孤立据点
    【本报太岳十四日电】太岳武委总会，于今日向全区民兵发出紧急号召：“拿出一切力量，投入全面大反攻！”号召首称：切盼了好久的全面大反攻，已经到来了，我们一方面觉得万分欢腾兴奋，另一方面感到我们任务也由此更加光荣重大。因此必须拿出我们一切力量来，投入全面大反攻。继即提出几点要求：一、加紧围困本区白点子运城、安邑、临汾等据点，用地雷把他们封锁起来，然后进一步的拔掉它们。二、加紧整理和建设野战连，在大反攻节节胜利之下，地区日益扩大，因而需要数量更多，质量更强的野战连随时远征。因此，我们要抓紧时机整理与尽量抽出空隙，进行必要的军事训练与政治工作建设。三、边沿地区需要保卫秋收，保卫壮丁。保一个壮丁，保一颗粮食，都是增加我们反攻的力量。四、新区翻身群众在大反攻情况下，主力军大量要打出去；镇压地主特务恶霸、保卫农民利益与维持革命秩序的任务，需要我们自己担任。一面进行翻身斗争，一面武装起来保卫翻身利益。
    【本报太岳十一日电】灵石静升民兵，从一个团的包围中英勇突围。八月二十五日拂晓，静升民兵被阎军一个团包围，虽然敌众我寡，但我民兵坚决勇敢，抱着宁死不当俘虏的决心，在敌人猛烈的炮火下，终于英勇突出重围，冲出大寨沟后，有人怕到秦村原上再碰到敌人，主张隐蔽。耿耿等同志提出：“宁在原上战死，不在沟里被敌人按死，坚决冲上去！”大家一致响应，一口气冲到了原上，安全脱险。马四孩同志带头背上彩号突围，表现了高度的阶级友爱精神。这种坚决勇敢的行动，区指挥特予通报表扬，并分别记功记好。
