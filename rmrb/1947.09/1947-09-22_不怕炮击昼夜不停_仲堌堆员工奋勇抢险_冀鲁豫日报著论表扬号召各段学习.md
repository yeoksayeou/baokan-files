[Reported by this newspaper from Hebei-Luyu on the 20th] (Late Dispatch) During the second major flood season of the Yellow River, our Yunbei repair section, led by the masses, braved the encirclement of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits' artillery fire to urgently repair the Zhonggudui dangerous work. At 2:15 PM on August 17th, the floodwaters rushed directly onto the newly swept slope, with waves as high as rooftops and the sound of the water audible for miles. The entire swept surface was washed into disarray. The flood continued to rise, and a small brushwood dam suddenly sank, as dangerous as a hair's breadth. Dam Foreman Wu Xianlun pointed to the sinking brushwood dam and said to squad leader Zhang Mingxun, "Mingxun, the brushwood has dropped its padding. Let's risk our lives to repair it. As long as we're alive, we can't let the brushwood dam be washed away!" Then, 220 civilians swarmed over, some carrying sorghum stalks, thick ropes, and wooden stakes, others pushing earth carts. Engineering team member Erni carried eight wooden stakes, sweat streaming down her face. After putting down the wooden stakes, she rushed to carry ropes. The masses scrambled to carry more sorghum stalks, actively carrying out emergency repairs. Engineering team member Feng De, already so tired he couldn't stand up straight, still didn't leave the slope. By 6 PM, the sun was high in the sky. The enemy scurried over from the north and south, machine guns chattering incessantly, bullets constantly flying near the slope. With a loud bang, a shell landed in front of the slope, but the emergency repair workers didn't move at all, continuing their work. Zhong Yannai, over seventy years old, called out, "The enemy is here, but we can't stop working. If we stop working and the brushwood dam is washed away and a breach opens, our houses, stoves, and lives will all be lost!" Sure enough, a gang of Chiang Kai-shek bandits was seen scurrying over, surrounding all the dam repair workers, driving them together for interrogation, and tying up Feng Debao, dragging him under a willow tree. Zhong Zhao'an hesitated slightly when speaking and was severely beaten with more than a dozen clubs by the enemy. The workers were not afraid under the enemy's threats. They shouted in unison: "We are all ordinary people, repairing the dam ourselves, eating our own food, saving our own lives. What crime is there...?" In the midst of the interrogation, several gunshots came from the east. The enemy panicked, did not assemble their formation properly, and scurried south, seizing three of the workers' shovels and some oil and salt. When the workers saw the enemy scurrying away, they immediately resumed emergency repairs, continuing until 9 PM the next night (August 18th), when the brushwood dam finally escaped danger.

[Reported by this newspaper from Hebei-Luyu on the 20th] *Hebei-Luyu Daily* published a short commentary, calling on the employees of all dangerous work sections of the Yellow River management during the Great Counteroffensive to learn from the Zhonggudui emergency repair workers, defeat the enemy, and complete our glorious task of "ensuring the safety of the Yellow River, firmly defending the Jin embankment, and not allowing any breaches" with a tense and combative attitude. The commentary pointed out: Zhonggudui is one of the important dangerous works, only ten to fifteen *li* away from the enemy's two strongholds. During the emergency repairs in May, it was harassed by the enemy nineteen times in twenty-five days, but finally, under the persistent repairs by cadres and the masses, disaster was averted and it was praised by the Yellow River Committee. This time, more than two hundred employees, under the enemy's artillery fire, encirclement, beatings, and interrogation, successfully completed the emergency repairs in two days and one night, averting a disaster that millions of people might have suffered, which is truly a historical feat. Section Chief Meng Hongjiu and Dam Foreman Wu Xianlun of the repair section demonstrated a high degree of political responsibility and were able to lead the masses by example at all times, adhering to their work throughout. This spirit of being highly responsible for the people is truly admirable! The commentary concluded by pointing out: From the mass activities of emergency repairs at Zhonggudui, it can be seen that emergency repair is a mass-based, conscious self-rescue movement. Regardless of day or night, enemy gunfire, disturbances, encirclements, Chiang Kai-shek's aircraft strafing and bombing, the masses remained calm and unafraid, demonstrating that the people of the border region are fully taking on their glorious task for their own self-preservation.

    不怕炮击昼夜不停
    仲堌堆员工奋勇抢险
    冀鲁豫日报著论表扬号召各段学习
    【本报冀鲁豫二十日电】（迟到）黄河第二次大泛期中，我郓北修防段领导群众冒蒋匪炮火包围，抢修仲＠堆险工。八月十七日下午二点十五分，洪水直冲到新扫上，浪高如屋脊，水声数里可闻。全部扫面，被水冲得乱动。洪水继续上涨，小埽突然下沉，危如千钧一发。坝吴先伦指着下沉的埽面对班长张明训说：“明训，埽已掉垫，咱拚死命抢吧，只要咱活着，不能让埽冲走！”接着二百二十名民夫，蜂拥而来，有的扛着秫秸、大绠木桩，有的推着土车，工程队员二妮扛着八根木桩，压的满脸流汗，放下木桩，就急去扛绠，群众抢着多扛秫秸，积极抢修。工程队员冯德，已累的直不起腰来，仍不下埽，时已六点，太阳高出地面，敌人由南北两面窜来，机枪声格格的响个不停，子弹不断飞到埽面附近，轰的一声，炮弹落到埽前，抢险员工丝毫没动，仍进行工作，七十余岁的仲延内号召说：“敌人来了，咱也不能停工，如果停工，埽被冲走开了口子，咱的房子、锅台、生命都保不住了！”果然，看的窜来了一股蒋匪，将所有修坝员工包围起来，赶到一块，进行审问，并将冯德宝捆起来，拉到柳树下。仲兆安说话稍一迟疑，被敌人毒打了十几棍，员工们在敌人的威胁下，没有恐惧。一致喊着：“我们都是老百姓，自己抢险，吃自己的饭，救自己的命，还有什么罪………”正在审问中，从东边传来几声枪声，敌人吓慌了，没集合好队形，即向南窜去，并抢去员工的铣三张和一部份油盐。员工们看到敌人窜去，又马上进行抢修，一直到第二天（十八日）夜九点，埽坝始脱险。
    【本报冀鲁豫二十日电】冀鲁豫日报发表短论，号召在大反攻声中，治河各段险工员工同志，向仲＠堆抢险员工同志学习，战胜敌人，以紧张战斗的姿态，来完成我们“确保临黄、固守金堤，不准开口”的光荣任务。该短论指出：仲＠堆为重要险工之一，仅距敌人两个据点十里至十五里之远，五月份抢险时，二十五天中被敌人袭扰十九次，终于在干部和群众坚持抢修下免除灾祸，曾受到黄委会表扬。此次二百多员工又在敌人炮火包围、吊打、审问中，经两天一夜抢修成功，免除了千百万人民可能遭受的灾祸，实为历史上之创举。该修防段长孟洪九、坝师吴先伦等。表现高度的政治责任心，任何情况下均能以身作则，带领群众，始终坚持工作，此种为人民十分负责之精神，实可钦佩！最后指出：从仲堆＠抢险的群众活动中，可以看出抢险是群众性的自觉自救运动，不论白天黑夜，敌人打枪、扰乱、包围、蒋机扫射轰炸，群众镇定如常，毫无恐惧，这说明是边区人民为了自救，完全负起自己的光荣任务。
