Xinhua News Agency, Northeast Front, urgent dispatch, 25th: After annihilating the enemy's 93rd Army's Provisional 22nd Division and Provisional 50th Division, the People's Liberation Army of the Hebei-Chahar-Rehe-Liaoning Military Region continued to develop its offensive, encircling the enemy's 49th Army's 79th Division, 105th Division (each missing a regiment), and the army's direct units, which were reinforcements from Jinzhou, in the Yangzhangzi area, 70 li west of Jinxi. From 13:00 on the 21st to 20:00 on the 22nd, after two days and nights of fierce fighting, the enemy was annihilated in one fell swoop. Initial statistics show that over 1,000 enemy soldiers were killed or wounded, and over 6,000 were captured, along with dozens of artillery pieces and over 200 light and heavy machine guns. It is reported that Chiang's 49th Army, formerly the reorganized 49th Division, was originally a Northeast Army. It was renamed as an army after being transferred from northern Jiangsu in late August to reinforce the Northeast. It consists of the 79th, 26th, and 105th Divisions. This army was completely annihilated by our northern Jiangsu People's Liberation Army in the Rugao battle in northern Jiangsu in mid-July last year. The army commander, Wang Tiehan, was captured and escaped, while the deputy army commander, Wang Kejun, was killed by us. This is the second time it has been annihilated.

Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 25th: The Andong Military Sub-district, under the slogan of "Thoroughly Destroy Chiang's Puppet Rule, Defend the Peasants' Emancipation," mobilized the army and the people to launch a military and political offensive against the remnants of Chiang's bandits. Under our efforts to win them over and disintegrate their forces, Chiang's bandits have surrendered with their weapons one after another. Recently, in the Saimashuangshanzi district alone, there were more than 160 people and guns; more than 70 members of the "Suppression Team" in the Guanshui district also returned with all their weapons. Zhang Hengjiu and others, more than ten bandits and puppet soldiers entrenched in the Saima Market area, carried two machine guns to surrender. It is reported that in the past June and July, in addition to killing and wounding more than 440 enemy soldiers, the sub-district has successively won over and disintegrated a total of 831 people, with the number of surrendered being twice the number of those killed and wounded, and seized many rifles, machine guns, ammunition, and materials.

    热东我军继续发展攻势
    锦西又歼蒋匪两师
    【新华社东北前线二十五日急电】冀察热辽人民解放军于歼敌九十三军暂编二十二师及暂五十师后，继续发展攻势，将由锦州增援之敌四十九军七十九师、一○五师（各缺一个团）及军直属队包围于锦西以西七十里之杨仗子地区，自二十一日十三时起至二十二日二十时激战两昼夜，将敌一举歼灭。初步统计毙伤敌千余人，俘敌六千余人，缴获各种炮数十门，轻重机枪二百余挺。按蒋匪四十九军即整编四十九师，原系东北军，八月下旬自苏北调援东北后改称为军，其下辖七十九、二十六、一○五三个师。该军去年七月中旬在苏北如皋战役中，曾被我苏北人民解放军全部歼灭，军长王铁汉俘后潜逃，副军长王克俊则被我击毙，此次乃系第二次被歼。
    【新华社东北二十五日电】安东某军分区在“彻底摧毁蒋伪统治，保卫农民翻身”口号中，军民一齐动员向蒋伪残匪发动军事与政治攻势，在我争取瓦解下蒋匪纷纷携械投诚，最近仅赛马双山子一个区，即有人枪各一百六十余；灌水区七十余名“清剿队”亦全部携械来归。盘踞赛马集区之匪伪张恒久等十余人，则携带机枪两挺前来自新。按该分区在前六、七两个月中，除毙伤敌四百四十余名外，先后争取瓦解投诚者共八百三十一名，计投诚者为毙伤之两倍，并收缴步机枪及弹约物资甚多。
