Xinhua News Agency, Yuxi Front, 26th. Jiang Gongmin, the Second Brigade Commander of the KMT Youth Army 206th Division, who was wounded and fled during the Lingbao battle, dejectedly escaped into the city of Shanxian. Before his fright had subsided, he was surrounded by the People's Liberation Army. On the night of the 17th, our army liberated the city. He fled into the air-raid shelter of the KMT commissioner's office in an attempt to hide. However, a hand grenade thrown by a PLA soldier caused more than 30 enemies to surrender and be captured, including Jiang Gongmin. After arriving at the reception center, Jiang Gongmin deceitfully claimed to be a library director named Zhang. However, his clothes, which he had not had time to change, and his extremely frightened expression immediately revealed his lie. After comparing him with a photograph captured in Lingbao, he could no longer deny it and said in a low voice, "I am Jiang Gongmin." When talking about the inside story of the KMT army, he complained a lot, cursing the commander-in-chief Xie Fusan as an idiot, and scolding the 135th Brigade Commander Zhu Xianian for being an unsupportive friend. He was filled with pessimism and disappointment about Jiang Z贼's civil war... Jiang Gongmin is from Guizhou, 41 years old, and a graduate of the Huangpu Military Academy.

Xinhua News Agency, Yuxi Front, 25th. In the Lingbao battle, farmer Zhu Chaoying captured the enemy with ingenuity and voluntarily joined the People's Liberation Army. After the annihilation of the KMT New First Brigade, Zhu Chaoying, a hired peasant from Qilipu, was cutting grass in the field on the morning of the 13th when he suddenly discovered nine KMT stragglers in a wild kiln. They all asked Zhu Chaoying for help to disguise themselves. Zhu Chaoying readily agreed, saying, "I'll get you food and find plain clothes." But he ran to Dongsai Village and brought back a dozen PLA soldiers. The nine KMT soldiers panicked and raised their hands, surrendering two submachine guns and two rifles. One of the prisoners was a radio station captain. On the way back, Zhu Chaoying told everyone that his ancestral home was Luoyang. Two years ago, he was conscripted by the KMT bandits. He escaped home on the way, but the Baozhang (local security chief) kept causing trouble, forcing him to flee and become a hired laborer. After telling his painful experience, Zhu Chaoying happily and resolutely requested to stay in the People's Liberation Army and become a glorious soldier.

    蒋公敏就俘经过
    【新华社豫西前线廿六日电】灵宝之战负伤潜逃的蒋青年军二零六师第二旅旅长蒋公敏丧魂落魄的逃入陕县城内，于惊魂未定时，又陷入了解放军的重围。十七日夜我大军解放该城，他逃入蒋记专员公署防空洞内企图隐蔽，但是解放军战士打了一颗手榴弹，卅余敌人缴枪就擒，蒋公敏也在其内。到招待所后，蒋公敏诡称是图书馆主任，姓张。但是他一身未及换去的衣裤和极度惊恐的表情，立即使人看出了破绽，再经用灵宝所缴获的照片一对照，他就无法狡辩，赧低声说：“我就是蒋公敏。”谈起蒋军的内幕，他就大发牢骚，骂总指挥谢辅三为饭桶，骂一三五旅旅长祝夏年不够朋友，对蒋贼的内战充满悲观失望……。蒋公敏为贵州人，现年四十一岁，黄埔军校毕业。
    【新华社豫西前线二十五日电】灵宝战斗中农民朱朝英机智俘敌，并自动参加人民解放军。蒋匪新一旅被歼后，十三日晨七里铺雇农朱朝英正在地里割草，忽然在野窑里发现九个蒋军的散兵，他们齐声向朱朝英要求帮忙化装，朱朝英满口答应说：“我给你们拿饭找便衣去。”他却一口气跑到东塞村，带回来十几个解放军，九个蒋军着了慌，一齐举起手来，缴出了两挺手提式，两枝步枪，俘虏中还有一个是电台队长。归途中朱朝英告诉大家说：他的原籍是洛阳，两年前被蒋匪抓过丁，他在半路上逃跑回家，保长又天天去找麻烦，迫得他逃出来当了长工。朱朝英讲完了他的痛苦经历，又满心欢喜的坚决要求留在解放军里当光荣的战士。
