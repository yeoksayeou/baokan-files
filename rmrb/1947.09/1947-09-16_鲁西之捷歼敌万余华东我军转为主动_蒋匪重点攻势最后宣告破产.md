　　【Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 14th】 The East China People's Liberation Army completely annihilated the Chiang Kai-shek bandit's reorganized 57th Division at Shatujie in Western Shandong on the 9th, achieving its first major victory in the counter-offensive. The East China People's Liberation Army Headquarters has just issued Public Notice No. 23 as follows: On the evening of September 7th, a unit of our army surrounded the Chiang Kai-shek bandit's direct line reorganized 57th Division (formerly the 98th Army), which was reinforcing Western Shandong, in the Shatujie area on the Heze-Juye Highway. After a day and night of battle, clearing the bandit's outer strongholds, we launched a general attack at 9:00 PM on the 8th and resolved the battle by 3:00 AM on the 9th, completely annihilating the division's 60th Brigade (formerly renamed the Pre-4th Brigade), the 117th Brigade, its division headquarters direct units, and two brigade headquarters (the division originally also had the Pre-3rd Brigade, which was annihilated in the Subei Campaign last winter). Preliminary statistics of the battle results include the capture of the division's Lieutenant General Commander Duan Linmao, the 117th Brigade's Major General Commander Luo Jueyuan, and over 8,000 officers and soldiers, the killing and wounding of over 2,000, totaling over 10,000. We seized eight Japanese-style howitzers, over twenty mountain guns, two field guns, three anti-tank guns, four infantry guns, and hundreds of light and heavy machine guns.
    【Xinhua News Agency, East China, 14th】 General Su Yu, Deputy Commander of the East China Field Army of the People's Liberation Army, recently commented on the great victory at Shatuqiao on the Heze-Juye Highway, saying: "The victory of our army in completely annihilating the Chiang Kai-shek bandit's reorganized 57th Division has played a significant role in protecting the Shandong Liberated Area and the Shandong people. It is a valuable contribution to the start of the counter-offensive by the East China People's Liberation Army and the overall counter-offensive by the People's Liberation Army. This victory shows that the Chiang Kai-shek bandit's key offensive, which he has repeatedly struggled with in Shandong, has finally been declared bankrupt. As a result, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit has turned to the defensive, and our army has shifted to the offensive." Deputy Commander Su then solemnly announced that a unit of the East China Field Army had successfully completed its transfer mission before this great victory, stating: "A unit of our army was ordered to maneuver and transfer in early August. For more than a month, we overcame numerous difficulties during the rainy season, climbing mountains and wading through rivers, sparing no effort, and finally completed the transfer mission. During this period, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, through their Central News Agency, fabricated various rumors, such as 'eliminating 120,000 Communist troops' in Shandong, and even 'the remaining Communist troops in Shandong will be completely wiped out,' etc., with the aim of trying to boost their demoralized morale, deceive the people, and solicit continued assistance from their American masters to save their collapsing crisis. This great victory of our army has dealt a thorough crushing blow to this pile of rumors from the Central News Agency." Finally, Deputy Commander Su affirmed: "The victory of our army in Western Shandong is still developing. At the same time, the powerful corps east of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway also has sufficient strength to annihilate the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Shandong. Our East China People's Liberation Army will definitely coordinate the counter-offensives on all battlefields with victorious battles, completely annihilate the Chiang Kai-shek bandits on the East China battlefield, and complete the glorious task of annihilating the enemy within the inner lines."

  　蒋匪重点攻势最后宣告破产
    【新华社华东前线十四日电】华东人民解放军九日于鲁西沙土集全歼蒋匪整编五十七师，获得反攻首次大捷。华东人民解放军总部顷发表第二十三号公报如下：我军一部于九月七日晚，将增援鲁西之蒋匪嫡系整编第五十七师（原九十八军）包围于荷（泽）钜（野）公路上沙土集地区，战斗一昼夜，扫清匪外围据点后，于八日下午九时发动总攻，至九日上午三时解决战斗，全部歼灭该师六十旅（原预四旅改称），一一七旅及其师部直属队并两个旅部（该师原尚有预三旅，早于去冬宿北战役被歼）。初步统计战果，计生俘该师中将师长段霖茂，一一七旅少将旅长罗觉元以下官兵八千余，毙伤两千余，共万余名，缴获日式榴弹炮八门，山炮二十余门，野炮二门，战防炮三门，步兵炮四门，轻重机枪数百挺。
    【新华社华东十四日电】解放军华东野战军副司令员粟裕将军顷对菏（泽）钜（野）公路沙土渠大捷发表谈话称：“我军全歼蒋匪整五十七师的胜利，对于保卫山东解放区和山东人民起了重大作用。是华东人民解放军开始反攻及人民解放军全面反攻中一个有价值的贡献。这一胜利说明蒋匪在山东一再挣扎的重点攻势已最后宣告破产，蒋匪因此转为被动，我军从此转为主动。”粟副司令继郑重地宣布，华东野战军一部于此次大捷之前，已经胜利完成转移任务称：“我军一部于八月初即奉命机动转移，月余以来克服雨季重重困难，登山涉水，不避艰辛，终于完成转移任务。在此期间，蒋贼通过其中央社制造种种谣言，有所谓在山东境内‘消灭共军十二万’，更有所谓‘山东残余共军将告肃清’等等，目的在企图振奋一下颓丧的士气，欺骗人民与邀得其美国主子的继续援助，挽救其崩溃的危机。我军此次大胜利，对中央社的这一堆谣言予以彻底粉碎的打击。”粟副司令最后又肯定地宣称：“我军在鲁西的胜利还在发展中，同时在津浦路以东的强大兵团亦有足够力量歼灭山东境内蒋匪，我华东人民解放军一定以胜利的战斗来配合各战场的反攻，全部歼灭华东战场蒋匪完成内线歼敌的光荣任务。”
