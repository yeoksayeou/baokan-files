Unable to Bear Chiang Kai-shek Bandit Landlord Exploitation
Shi and Huo's Starving People Rise Up to Seize the Harvest

[Reported by our newspaper from Taihang on the 24th] The starving people in the outskirts of Shijiazhuang and Huo County, who have suffered all kinds of extortion and exploitation by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit landlords and despots, are rising up to seize the autumn harvest. On the nights of the 23rd and 24th of last month, more than 100 starving people from Dujiazhuang, Huo County, gathered to seize 19 mu of millet and corn from the landlord Li Keqin in the village. On the 24th, starving people from Zhengzhuang (four li from the city of Huo County) first drove away the landlord's henchman "watcher" and seized 25 mu of millet from the big landlord Zhu Xiaowu in the village. Starving people from Zhangying Village on the outskirts of Shijiazhuang seized all 40 mu of millet from a big landlord in one day. When the landlord heard the news, he colluded with the Chiang Kai-shek bandits of the puppet township office, attempting to suppress the people in Zhangying. The starving people, holding sticks, shouted: "Come on, you little bastards! We'd rather starve to death, or be shot to death!" They beat back the stubborn bandits and despots. As of today, incidents of starving people seizing the autumn harvest continue to occur in villages in Shiqiao, Hengshan, and Shenhou areas between Shijiazhuang and Huo County. According to a survey from the beginning of the year to the end of June, each liang of silver in Zhengzhuang village, with 210 households, had to bear 380 jin of wheat, 280 jin of rice, and 200,000 yuan. This does not include all the village's expenses, so the starving people have no choice but to resort to this strategy. Now, the starving people in the Chiang Kai-shek bandit-controlled area are rising up to save themselves and seize the autumn grain from the landlords.

    不堪蒋匪地主压榨
    石获饥民奋起抢收
    【本报太行二十四日电】受尽蒋匪地主奸霸百般勒索压榨之石门市外围及获鹿一带饥民，正奋起抢秋。获鹿杜家庄饥民，于上月二十三、四两夜，集合百余人，抢收该村地主李克勤谷子、玉茭等十九亩。二十四日，郑庄（距获鹿城四里）饥民，首将地主狗腿“看田”人赶跑，抢收城内大地主朱小五在该村之二十五亩谷子。石门外围张营村饥民，一天内即将一大地主之四十亩谷子，全部抢收。地主闻讯，勾结伪大乡公所蒋匪，企图到张营镇压，饥民执棒大喊：“小子们来吧，你爷饿死也是死，枪子打死也是死！”当将顽匪奸霸击退。截至日前，石门与获鹿间之石桥、横山、申后一带村庄，仍连续发生饥民抢秋事件。郑庄一村二百一十户，仅据年初至六月底之调查，每两银子已负担小麦三百八十斤，米二百八十斤，款二十万元，村中一切开支尚未统计在内，故饥民不得不出此一策。现该区蒋匪统治之饥民，正奋起自救，从地主手中夺取秋粮。
