    Local Armed Forces South of the Yellow River in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Region Annihilate 500 Enemies in One Month
    [Special Dispatch from this Newspaper] The former Changsheng Taigu Independent Battalion was promoted to the Taigu Independent Regiment in August. Cooperating with a certain regiment of the Second Sub-district and local work teams and militia, on the 27th, it feigned an attack on the enemy stronghold in Yangyi to lure the enemy in Taigu city to come to reinforce. Another force was deployed to ambush between Linkai and Xinglin. The chief of staff of the Ninth Column, the main force of the Yan stubborn troops in Taigu, led the first and third battalions of the Second Regiment, the third battalion of the Third Regiment, and a part of the mountain artillery battalion, more than 800 people, to reinforce Yangyi in a hurry. They set out at 9:00 AM, searching with high vigilance, and were reluctant to move forward for a long time. It took a full four hours for all of them to enter our ambush circle (Xinglin is only eight miles away from Taigu city). We immediately launched a fierce assault, squeezing the enemy into a narrow area. After 20 minutes of bayonet fighting, most of the enemy was annihilated. In total, 193 enemy soldiers were captured alive, including four company commanders and below. One deputy regimental commander and one battalion commander were killed or wounded, as well as 250 others below. One mountain gun (missing the gun mount), one mortar, eight light cannons, two heavy machine guns (one missing the筒子), thirteen light machine guns, 130 rifles, more than 15,000 rounds of ammunition, and 13 donkeys and horses were seized. We only suffered 10 wounded and four glorious sacrifices. (Ru Qiang, Tuofu)
    [Dispatch from Hebei-Shandong-Henan Region, 5th of this month] Since August, local armed forces in various sub-districts south of the Yellow River in our region have persisted in staying put and launched "seesaw" struggles with the invading Chiang Kai-shek troops. According to incomplete statistics, a total of 22 battles have been fought, capturing 160 enemy soldiers, killing or wounding 374 enemy soldiers, seizing two light machine guns, three mortars, 168 rifles, five short guns, 3,200 rounds of ammunition, two boxes of grenades, 100 rounds of submachine gun ammunition, 20 shells, 1,800 catties of wire, 46 million 法币, and 3,000 catties of grain.
    [Dispatch from Hebei-Shandong-Henan Region, 5th of this month] Fanggui District of Shan County is located in the most tense and complex area of the struggle against the enemy. However, until the end of July, the work team in the district always insisted on the position, and crushed all kinds of enemy sweeps and attacks. Under the leadership of Comrade Li Xuebin, deputy secretary of the district party committee, and Comrade Li Fenghua, the district chief, they overcame various difficulties and opened up the situation. For this reason, the county party committee specially issued a notice of commendation and called on all districts to learn from them.
    Fanggui District is located between the Shan County and Jinxiang highway, with 110 natural villages. The enemy's Eighty-eighth Division has two companies, more than 200 people, and the puppet Fanggui District teams and puppet township offices, totaling more than 300 people, often sweep and plunder in this small area every two or three days. Under such tense circumstances, District Chief Li Fenghua and Deputy Secretary Li Xuebin led nine people and nine guns, and inserted them on April 6th to develop guerrilla warfare. The method of adhering to the struggle at the beginning was to adopt the method of "the enemy enters this village, I go to that village; the enemy advances, I move; the enemy concentrates, I disperse; the enemy disperses, I concentrate," and encircling villages one by one, so that the enemy's ten to thirty times superior force fought 55 battles in 72 days, killing or wounding 52 Chiang Kai-shek and puppet soldiers, and we seized two short guns. We won every battle without any casualties, and developed from nine people to thirty-seven people, strengthening our own forces. In the guerrilla warfare, we combined land reform and tunnel construction. At the beginning of the land reform, the masses were afraid, but the comrades of the work team were not discouraged. They studied and came up with the step of resolutely supporting the masses, adopting the step of "doing the hard things first and then the soft things", executing the worst and most stubborn landlords such as Yuan Zhuang and Daweizhuang, and imprisoning the close relatives and friends of Shi Xijiu, a large landlord (puppet magistrate of Chengwu County), a Chiang Kai-shek and puppet traitor in Hanzhuang Shan County, a total of twenty-three people, and explaining land reform to them first. On the other hand, a mass meeting was convened to expose the crimes of the landlords and explain the principle that land should be returned to the people. Then, Shi Xijiu's relatives were brought to the venue to kowtow to the masses, swear an oath, sign and affix their seals, replace Shi Xijiu in handing over the land, and guarantee that there would be no problems. The masses demanded that we directly distribute grain and land to support them in this way. The masses said: "If you do it this way, we will be bold enough to do it. If we do it ourselves, we will be turned upside down by those bad elements (Chiang Kai-shek and puppet military agents). If you don't avenge us, we can't live!" In the ninety days of "fighting while dividing" and "dividing at night if we can't divide during the day", the land reform of eighty-three villages was initially completed. The method of combining land reform with digging tunnels was to divide the work of cadres and armed forces specifically, first do a good job in land reform, and the villagers who engage in land reform will dig tunnels to rely on to protect their fields and lives, control landlords and bad guys, defeat the enemy, and protect their livelihoods. After the land reform was completed, the tunnels were also completed. In propaganda work, whenever we go to a village, as long as the situation permits, we will hold a village meeting, or if we cannot, we will hold individual meetings, or small forums with a dozen people. The masses believe that Chiang Kai-shek's troops will not last long. After propaganda, the puppet dependents of Shanglou and Chenzhuang called back seven of their children to repent to the government. In the propaganda of unified currency, we first controlled the market and explained that if Chiang Kai-shek currency is not eliminated, the poor will continue to suffer. We severely punished bad elements who disrupted the market and continued to use Chiang Kai-shek currency. A total of 110 villages were publicized, 330 times, with 30,000 listeners. From then on, Shandong currency was used from underground to openly, from one Shandong currency to twenty Chiang Kai-shek currency, to thirty, the price rose day by day. At the beginning of adhering to the struggle, some cadres were more afraid of death and hardship. After the leadership paid attention to ideological leadership and grasped the active elements with strong fighting spirit of the poor peasants, they brought up the middle peasants who were not active enough in the struggle, and gradually increased their enthusiasm for the struggle, affecting the cadres from wealthy families. At first, they reluctantly hid and worked, and gradually improved and promoted their consciousness, and in the commendation for meritorious service, they commended the hero who killed the enemy, Li Qunxi. He was brave and calm in every battle, advancing in the front and retreating in the rear. He killed a company commander of the 32nd Division of the Chiang Kai-shek army and wounded three Chiang Kai-shek puppet soldiers. The leadership's clear rewards and punishments and internal unity have allowed them to successfully persevere in the difficult situation of Fanggui District.

    【本报冀鲁豫五日电】单县芳桂区处在对敌斗争最紧张复杂的地带。但直到七月底，该区武工队始终坚持了阵地，粉碎了敌人各种扫荡和进攻，在区委副书记李学宾、区长李烽光两同志的领导下，克服种种困难，打开了局面。为此，县委会特通令表扬，并号召各区向他们学习。
    芳桂区处在单县金乡公路间，有自然村一百一十个，敌人八八师两个连二百多人及伪芳桂区区队伪乡公所等共三百余人，经常三天两天的在这个狭小地带扫荡和抢掠。在这样紧张情况下，区长李烽光和副区书李学宾二同志，率领九个人、九条枪，于四月六日插入开展游击战争。开始坚持斗争的办法是采取敌进这村，我至那村，敌进我移，敌停我扰，敌集中我分散，敌分散我集中，逐庄围圈办法，使敌优于我十倍至三十倍的兵力，在七十二天中，作战五十五次，伤死蒋伪军五十二名，我缴短枪二支。我每仗必胜，无一伤亡，并由九人发展到卅七人，壮大了自己力量。在游击战中，结合了土改、地道建设。开始土改时，群众恐惧，但武工队同志并不灰心，研究出坚决为群众撑腰，采取“先搞硬后搞软”的步骤，把袁庄、大魏庄等最坏最硬的地主处决，将韩庄单县蒋伪汉奸时锡九大地主（伪城武县长）所有近亲挚友廿三口关起来，先向他们讲解土地改革。另一面召集群众会，揭发地主罪恶，解释土地还家理应该。接着，把时锡九亲族带到会场，向群众磕头盟誓，签字画押，代替时锡九交地，保证不出任何问题。群众要求我们这样直接分粮分地撑腰办法，群众说：“您们这样办，俺就大胆敢干，要是咱自己去办，就得被那些坏分子（蒋伪军特务）倒栽葱，您再不给俺报仇，俺也不能活了！”在“一边打、一边分”，“白天不能分就夜间分”的九十天中，八十三个村土改得到了初步完成。土改结合挖地道的办法，是干部和武装具体分工掌握，先搞好土改，搞土改的村庄群众即挖地道，作保田保命的依靠，管制地主坏蛋，打败敌人，保住饭碗。土改完成，随即地道也完成。在宣传工作上，每到一村，只要情况允许，即开村民会，不能开即个别开，或开十几人的小型座谈会，群众相信蒋军不得久长。商楼、陈庄的伪属，在宣传后，便将自己的子弟叫回来七个，向政府悔过。在统货的宣传上，先控制集市，进行讲解蒋币不除、贫民受苦不止，并对捣乱市场，继续使用蒋币的坏分子，严加惩办。共宣传了一百一十个庄，三百三十次，听众达三万人，从此鲁钞由暗地到公开的使用，由鲁钞一元折蒋币二十元，到三十元，价格一天天上涨。开始坚持斗争时，部分干部多怕死，怕艰苦。经过领导上注意思想领导，掌握贫农斗争性强的积极分子，带起了斗争不够积极的中农成份，渐渐提高其斗争热情，影响了富家出身的干部，起初勉强的躲着干，徐徐提高和促进其自觉，并在立功表模中，表扬了杀敌英雄李群修，他每次战斗英勇沉着，进攻在前，退却在后，曾打死蒋军三十二师一个连长，打伤蒋伪军三名。领导上的偿罚严明、内部团结，在芳桂区的恶劣形势下胜利的坚持下来。
