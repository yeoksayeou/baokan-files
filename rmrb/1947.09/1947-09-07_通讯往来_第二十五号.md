To All Offices, County Party Committee Propaganda Departments, and Comrade Correspondents:

The Xinhua News Agency editorial and the General Editorial Department's special article published in our newspaper on "September 1st" have been printed as loose-leaf pages and distributed to comrade correspondents in various regions. It is hoped that propaganda departments and offices in various regions will organize correspondents to study them. In conjunction with September 3rd, commemorate the "September 1st" editorial's call to "establish a worker-peasant correspondent network," examine the attitude toward writing for the Party newspaper and whether there is a "empty talk" style. Worker-peasant cadre correspondents should, through self-examination of their thinking, inspire worker-peasant comrades to consciously recognize that workers and peasants should become the main body of news correspondence work, and mobilize worker-peasant cadres to actively participate in news reporting work in order to transform and build the rural worker-peasant correspondent network. In addition, please conduct discussions according to the call in our newspaper's "September 1st" short commentary, "Strictly Examine Stance and Style," and examine whether there are any news reports in your county, district, or village that are not true, or completely inconsistent with the facts. Pay particular attention to whether there are any news reports in land reform and other reports that distort the facts, damage the interests of farmers, and protect landlords, losing their position. We hope to quickly reflect the specific facts and the opinions of the masses to us.

　　通讯往来　第二十五号各地办公室、县委宣传部、通讯员同志：
    本报“九一”所发表之新华社社论及总社编辑部专论已印成活页分发各地通讯员同志。希各地宣传部办公室组织通讯员研究学习。结合九月三号，纪念“九一”社论号召“建立工农通讯网”问题，检查给党报写稿态度，是否有“克里空”作风。工农干部通讯员应从检查思想中，启发工农同志自觉认识工农应成为新闻通讯工作的主体，动员工农干部积极参加通讯报导工作，以改造和建设农村工农通讯网。此外，并请根据本报“九一”短论“严格检查立场与作风”的号召，进行讨论，检查本县、本区、村有那些新闻通讯不够真实，或完全不符事实的情形？特别注意在土地改革等报导中，有那些歪曲事实、损害农民利益、袒护地主丧失立场的新闻报导？希将具体事实和群众意见迅速反映给我们。
