    Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains Front, 19th: After entering Xishui, a unit of Liu Deng's army continued to expand along the river and captured Huangmei County in eastern Hubei on the 15th of this month. The results of the battle are still being investigated. Another unit captured Susong County in Anhui on the 17th. The defending enemy fled upon hearing the news. We seized one light machine gun, one heavy machine gun, more than 20 rifles, two radio stations, and many other military supplies.

    Xinhua News Agency, Jinji-Luyu Front, 19th: The 356th Regiment of the 68th Division of Liu Ruzhen's Chiang Kai-shek troops stationed in Juancheng, western Shandong, staged a glorious anti-civil war uprising on the 14th. The entire regiment of more than 2,000 men, led by Regiment Commander Zhang Gonghan, joined the People's Liberation Army. The city was immediately liberated. More than a thousand returning home corps members were captured without exception.

    Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 19th: A frontline reporter reports on the annihilation of Chiang Kai-shek's reorganized 57th Division: The exhausted Chiang Kai-shek's reorganized 57th Division, in coordination with the reorganized 5th Division, invaded Yuncheng. They were severely attacked by the People's Liberation Army's blocking forces and failed to advance for three days. On September 6th, they discovered that the PLA's iron pincers were extending to their flanks and rear. They hastily retreated from the Wanglaohu and Xuhai lines and gathered at Shatuji and its southeastern Dawangzhuang and Xuzhuang lines. On the 7th, the PLA completely surrounded the 57th Division. At midnight, they first attacked Xuzhuang, annihilating the first and third battalions of the tenth regiment of the 60th Brigade, and at the same time captured more than ten enemy outposts. On the 8th, all the bandits around Shatuji were eliminated, and the Chiang bandits in the village became turtles in a jar. At dusk on the 8th, the PLA approached the enemy's positions with calm and swift movements. A unit of a certain company suddenly appeared in front of the bunker outside the north gate, taking the enemy sentries by surprise. Without firing a shot, they captured a squad of enemy soldiers alive. At about 9 o'clock, a general attack was launched. Amidst the roar of artillery fire and the billowing smoke, the PLA assault teams bravely broke through the roadblocks and crossed the trenches. Within twenty minutes, they broke through the enemy's defensive fortifications on the north side, opening five gaps. The "Guo Jisheng Hero Company," the "Tai'an Assault Hero Qi Wenyong Company," and several other assault teams, which had already performed meritorious service in battle, successively rushed onto the walls from the north. Then, brother units successively broke into the village, and the various armies poured in from all directions, quickly sweeping away the Chiang bandits' bunker groups and street fighting fortifications. Under the PLA's overwhelming power, the enemy's morale collapsed, and the soldiers had no will to fight. Although they made two forced counterattacks, they collapsed as soon as the PLA retaliated. Many enemy soldiers hid in their fortifications without firing a single shot, waiting to surrender. Under the political offensive on the front line, even entire companies of enemy troops collectively laid down their weapons. The PLA units participating in the battle captured several times or even dozens of times the number of enemy officers and soldiers and weapons with a small force and at a very small cost. The battle ended at 3:00 a.m. on the 9th, and Chiang Kai-shek's direct line reorganized 57th Division was completely annihilated.

    中原前线沿江扩展攻势
    我军续克黄梅宿松
    鄄城蒋匪一团光荣起义
    【新华社中原前线十九日电】刘邓大军一部于进占浠水之后，继续沿江扩展，于本月十五日攻占鄂东之黄梅县城，战果正清查中。另一部于十七日攻占安徽宿松县城，守敌闻风逃窜，我缴获轻重机枪各一，步枪二十余支，电台两部，其他军用品甚多。
    【新华社晋冀鲁豫十九日电】驻鲁西鄄城之蒋匪刘汝珍部六八师三五六团，十四日举行反内战光荣起义。全团二千余人由团长张功韩率领，全部参加人民解放军，该城即告光复。另有还乡团千余悉数被俘，无一漏网。
    【新华社华东前线十九日电】前线记者报导蒋匪整编五十七师就歼经过：疲惫不堪的蒋匪整编五十七师配合整编第五师进犯郓城，遭解放军阻击部队的严重打击，三天未得前进，至九月六日，发现解放军的铁钳伸向其侧后，乃慌忙自王老虎、徐海一线回窜，集结于沙土集及其东南大王庄、徐庄一线，七日，解放军即将五七师全部包围，午夜首攻徐庄，歼敌六十旅十团一、三两个营，同时攻克匪外围据点十余处。八日将沙土集外围之匪全部肃清，集内蒋匪乃成瓮中之鳖。八日黄昏，解放军以沉着神速动作接近匪阵。某连一部乘匪哨兵不备，突然出现于北门外之地堡前，一枪未发，生俘匪军一个班，九时许发起总攻，在炮火轰鸣与烟雾弥漫中，解放军各突击队健儿奋勇突破鹿砦，跨越壕沟，二十分钟内即突破北面匪军防御工事，打开五个缺口，早著战功的“郭继胜英雄连”“泰安突击英雄齐文勇连”及数个突击队，均先后自北面冲上围墙。接着各兄弟部队相继突入圩内，各路大军从四面八方涌进，迅速扫除蒋匪碉堡群及巷战工事。在解放军威震下，匪军心涣散，兵无斗志，虽曾勉强两度反扑，但一经解放军还击，匪即纷纷溃退。许多匪军士兵躲在工事里不发一弹，等待缴枪。在火线政治攻势下，更有成连匪军集体放下武器，解放军参战各部以少数兵力和极小代价俘获数倍乃至数十倍的匪军官兵和武器，战斗至九日晨三时结束，蒋贼嫡系整编五十七师遂告全歼。
