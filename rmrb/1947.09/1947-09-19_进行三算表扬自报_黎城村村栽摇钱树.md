　　[This Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Licheng] Licheng has achieved results in rectifying village finances. According to preliminary statistics, over 10 million Jibi currency, over 200 *shi* of grain, over 500 *mu* of land, and over 1,000 rooms have been recovered, along with various collective items, landmines, shells, rifles, and other miscellaneous weapons. Excluding the weapons, the total value is over 50 million Jibi currency, accounting for 117% of the county's border region burden quota. According to statistics from the seven villages including Xiwu, where rectification was relatively thorough, the total value of recovered goods and wealth is over 3 million Jibi currency (excluding weapons). The above results are only from preliminary rectification and have not yet formed a comprehensive movement.

　　In order to universally launch this movement, leading cadres of the joint districts held a meeting on September 6th to study and focused on discussing the current financial problems. After Deputy County Head Yan introduced the current financial situation, the comrades respectively reviewed past waste and shortcomings and recognized that rectifying finances is a pressing task. Then, each district exchanged experiences: 1. Taking hired peasants and poor peasants as the backbone to lead the masses in rectification, using the three-calculation method (calculating burdens, calculating family property, calculating war consumption) to enlighten the masses' thinking. 2. Launching commendation and modeling activities, using rewards to inspire the self-awareness of cadres and the masses. For example, in Sidi Village in the Fifth District, when the idea of rectifying finances was raised, most people said that their village had nothing. The education director proposed "A poor village has an inexhaustible collective," as long as there is rectification, there will be things. However, the cadres did not dare to self-report, so it was proposed that self-reporting would not be punished and would even be rewarded. After armed cadre Wu Fengtai reported a wooden bucket and was commended, the entire village reported materials worth a total of over 300,000 Jibi currency. Finally, several issues were decided: (1) Those who cannot quickly hand over the assets reported by the masses can hand them over in installments based on their family circumstances. (2) County, district, and village cooperatives should return to the masses all the fruits of the masses' struggle. If public property such as timber is used to build houses, it should be treated as an investment at a price and dividends should be distributed according to shares. (3) Militiamen who use public property to buy guns can be officially reimbursed. Those who use real guns, ammunition, and weapons from the masses should be returned in full. If they cannot be returned immediately, the masses should resolve it. (4) Those who used the public granary themselves in the past, if they are poor households who cannot afford to repay, the masses should treat it as formal relief; those who can afford to repay should repay the grain in full. (5) All kinds of social burdens should be strictly stopped. In the future, all donations must be approved by the County Finance and Economics Committee. (6) In terms of production management, the slogan is "Each person plants a money tree," establish more handicraft workshops, try not to engage in commercial production, organize village financial management committees, uniformly manage decentralized operations, and democratically approve expenditures. The slogan proposed by Taipei Village is: "Turn dead things into living things, gain profits without losing capital, open expenditures to the public, and let the masses approve."

　　进行三算表扬自报
  　黎城村村栽摇钱树
    【本报黎城讯】黎城整理村财政，已获得成绩。据初步统计，已整出冀钞一千余万元，粮食二百余石，土地五百余亩，房屋一千余间，还有各项社物及地雷、炮弹、步枪其他零碎武器等，除武器外，共折价五千余万元，占全县边区负担款百分之一百一十七，据整理较彻底的西仵等七个村的统计，整理出的货财共折价三百余万元（武器除外）。以上成绩仅是初步整理，还没形成全面运动。
    为了普遍开展这一运动，九月六号联区主要干部开会研究，着重讨论了当前财政问题，延副县长将当前的财政情况介绍后，各同志分别检讨以往的浪费和缺点，认识了整理财政是当前的紧急任务。接着各区交流经验：一、以雇佃贫为骨干带领群众进行整理，用三算办法（算负担、算家当、算战争消耗）打通群众思想。二、开展表功表模运用奖励办法启发干群自觉，如五区寺底村提出整理财政，大部分人说，咱村无啥东西，教育主任提出了“有穷村无穷社”，只要整理就有东西。但干部都不敢自报，于是提出了自报不罚而且得奖，武装干部吴风台报出木桶一个表扬后，全村报出物资共值三十余万元。最后决定几个问题：（一）群众自报资财不能迅速交出者，可根据其家庭情况分期交出。（二）县区村合作社动用群众斗争果实，应一概退还群众。如系公产木材建筑房屋者应以作价投资按股分红。（三）民兵用公产买枪者可正式报销，如用群众的实枪支弹药者应如数退还，不能即时退还者通过群众解决。（四）以前保管义仓，自己用了，如系贫苦户出不起者通过群众作为正式救济，能出起者如数出粮。（五）各项社会负担严格停止，今后一切募捐必须县财经委员会批准。（六）在生产管理上，口号是“每人栽活一棵摇钱树”，多办手工业作坊，尽量不做商业生产，组织村财政管理委员会，统一管理分散经营，民主开支。台北村提出口号是：“死物变活物，得利不失本，开支要公开，群众来批准”。（步衡、英瑞、福善、保成、景玉、光德、江平、记林）
