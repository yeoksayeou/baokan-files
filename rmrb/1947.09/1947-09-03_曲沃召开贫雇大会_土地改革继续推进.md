　　Quwo Convenes Poor and Hired Peasant Conference
　　Land Reform Continues to Advance
　　[This newspaper, Taiyue, 2nd dispatch] After the land reform in Quwo broke through more than 180 villages through anti-compilation village and anti-retaliation, the movement is now being further advanced by hired and poor peasant backbones. In mid-August, each district separately convened conferences of hired and poor peasant activists, totaling more than 2,000 people, to initiate the telling of grievances, universally recounting ten major grievances, including the grievances of retaliation, the grievances of compilation, the grievances of supplying labor, and the grievances of providing corvee. Many villages reviewed that the reason why the struggle in the past was not thorough and was retaliated against was due to the lack of poor peasant backbones. This year, the poor peasants must grasp the leadership, and the knife handle must be in the hands of the poor peasants so that the struggle can be deepened and thorough. They also reviewed the reasons why some villages were led by hired and poor peasants last year, but the struggle was still not thorough. Cadres from Wangcun, Shenquan, and other villages said: "Last year, we were fooled by the landlords, established fake peasant associations, and carried out fake struggles, sheltering the landlords." They also recalled the evil consequences caused by sheltering the landlords, saying: "When the Kuomintang army arrived, the landlords fabricated accounts, carried out retaliation, emptied the villages, demolished houses, and arrested our cadres and sent them to the West Great Prison, where they suffered all kinds of torture." These bloody facts aroused everyone's resentment, saying: "The landlords must be completely eliminated!"

　　曲沃召开贫雇大会
  　土地改革继续推进
    【本报太岳二日电】曲沃土地改革，由反编村反倒算突破一百八十余村后，现以雇贫骨干继续推进运动。八月中旬，各区均分头召开共达两千余人的雇贫积极分子大会，发动诉苦，普遍诉出倒算苦、编组苦、供丁苦、支差苦等十种大苦，许多村庄检讨过去所以斗争不彻底，被倒算，是由于缺少贫民骨干，今年必须贫农掌握领导权，刀把子拿到贫农手里，斗争就能深入彻底。他们又检讨了有些村庄去年虽为雇贫领导，但仍斗争不彻底的原因；王村、神泉等村干部说：“去年受地主愚弄，成立假农会，进行假斗争，包庇了地主。”又回忆包庇地主所造成的恶果说：“蒋军到来，地主捏造帐目，进行倒算，把村子倒光，把房屋拆毁，把咱们当干部的抓到西大狱，受尽苦刑。”这些血的事实，激动大家愤恨的说：“地主必须彻底消灭！”
