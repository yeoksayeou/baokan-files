　　Black Old Man Becomes a Hero
    Yan Fu
  　(I)
    Zhang Changyi is a new soldier in the fourth squad of the seventh company of the 38th Regiment, only twenty-one years old this year. This comrade is short, skinny, slightly hunched, with shorter arms and legs than average. His hands and face are dark, almost bluish-black, he stares blankly when looking at people, and he pants when doing heavy work. Some mischievous soldiers in the squad gave him a nickname: "Black Old Man!"
    Because "Black Old Man" was a new recruit and his body wasn't very strong, he kept falling behind when the unit was moving from ×× to ×× last month. The night of the battle at Lulou, his legs weren't strong enough to even cross the ditch. He fell into the ditch when carrying the ladder. He couldn't throw a grenade more than fifteen meters, almost injuring his own men. Not only was he useless, but he became a burden to the entire squad! After this, his rifle was taken away. While marching, he was given a military shovel to carry. The comrades in the squad all said he didn't have much of a future, and some even complained, demanding that the superiors transfer him out of the squad, regretting that they shouldn't have accepted him in the first place.
    When the troops were enlisting new soldiers in Xiyang, in the afternoon, "Black Old Man" came, hunched over, standing in front of the table, repeatedly saying: "Write my name down!" The secretary looked up and then turned his head to someone else. Until everyone else had been checked, and the eight people from Beilingyang Village had all been accepted, only "Black Old Man" wasn't approved. After everyone else had left, he still stood upright in front of the table, his eyes glued to the secretary's face: "Write my name down!" The secretary waved his hand impatiently: "Go back, you're no good! Look at you… … …!"
    "Black Old Man" remained standing still.
    The secretary later spent a lot of effort persuading him before he finally left.
    "Black Old Man" went back and cried with his wife for a while. The next day he came again. This time, following his wife's advice, he washed his face and hands, tightened his belt, dressed neatly and smartly. As soon as he entered the registration office, he stood in front of the table again.
    That secretary glanced at him sideways, a flicker of emotion passing over his face, but in the end, he waved his hand again: "Still no good!" The people beside him laughed.
    "How old are you this year?" Another comrade at the table, unlike the others, asked him in detail.
    "Eighteen!" "Black Old Man" quickly replied, having lied about being three years younger, as his wife had told him to.
    "Eighteen?" This comrade looked him up and down again, thought for a moment, and then muttered to himself: "He's still young, he can still grow, with some training, maybe there's still some hope!"
    At this moment, "Black Old Man" felt a surge of emotion, as if he was on fire. He was so happy that he couldn't even speak.
    "Black Old Man" put on his military uniform and was assigned to the Seventh Company.
    But, for more than two months now, he's been bad at fighting and bad at marching! He can't even stand on his feet. Everyone has recently been discussing giving him some food and sending him home.
    He was really worried. A few days ago, when the company was treating scabies, he worked hard. Whenever he saw a scabies sufferer, he would automatically go over to rub their backs and arms, often with yellow ointment all over his hands. When doing work, he would choose the heavy tasks. One day, he mixed mud in the heavy snow to repair the bathhouse for everyone. The squad members' scabies scabs and clothing, discarded in the corner of the wall, he secretly went to wash. One day he washed several sets, but the weather was cold and they didn't dry. He hung them under the eaves and sat at the door all night, afraid they would be lost.
    After these things were discovered by everyone, the comrades were somewhat moved, but things still didn't seem to be improving. He saw the expressions on everyone's faces, as if they were still discussing him, as if they were still going to send him home, especially Liu Jujiang's words: "Just being able to endure hardship isn't enough! The army is a place for fighting, you have to know how to fight, you can't do it! I think, huh, in the end, eight times out of ten, you'll still be going back… … …?" He could never forget it.
    One evening, as everyone was playing games, he sneaked back alone and sat on the doorstep, tears streaming down his face. He began to recall his painful history!
    "Black Old Man" was originally born in a small mountain village behind Beilingyang in Xiyang, in the middle of the mountains. His father was a farmhand who starved to death in a year of famine. At that time, "Black Old Man" was eleven years old. He left the broken cave dwelling and went with his younger brother to the top of the mountain to reclaim wasteland, leaving his old mother to beg for food at the foot of the mountain.
    The mountains were full of stones. "Black Old Man" lived with the poor people on the mountain, relying entirely on wild vegetables to survive. Usually, they ate wild boar vegetables, grey amaranth, prickly jie vegetables, wild alfalfa… … … more than thirty kinds! They even ate white clay. Sometimes his mother would send some bran bread up, and take a look at her son. Once, when mother and son met, she saw that her Changyi had become as thin as firewood. His mother cried out: "Child! How did you become like this?!"
    "Black Old Man" worked day and night, finally clearing a piece of wasteland. The following year, he harvested some grain, but the landlord from the foot of the mountain came up again and took all the harvest, saying that this piece of land had been his ten years ago.
    As a result, his mother fell ill from hunger and anger and died! She didn't even have a mat to sleep on when she was buried. "Black Old Man" and his brother didn't know how many tears they shed. His brother soon died of illness too. But "Black Old Man" had a strong will, he decided to continue working and continue living on this mountain.
    He was so angry that he didn't want that piece of land anymore. He started digging in the cracks between the large stones again. Year after year, through wind, frost, rain, and dew, until the great counter-offensive of the War of Resistance Against Japan, when the Eighth Route Army liberated Xiyang City. Ten years of hardship turned a child into an old man!
    After the Eighth Route Army arrived, "Black Old Man" resolutely engaged in struggle and quickly turned himself around, getting seven acres of land, half a courtyard of tile-roofed houses, marrying a wife, and reburying his mother. Later, he heard that the stubborn Third Army had arrived in Shijiazhuang, and the higher-ups called for enlistment. He and his wife discussed it and decided to repay the kindness of the Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army by enlisting.
    But now everyone says he's not qualified and wants to send him home.
    No, he can't go home! First, he wants to repay kindness, and second, he wants to fight the landlords and vent his anger for his parents!
    The more "Black Old Man" thought about it, the tighter he clenched his teeth. He couldn't go back even if he died, he must learn to fight! He pulled up his sleeves to wipe away his tears, and suddenly saw the squad leader flashing in from the gate.
    "Why are you crying?" The squad leader was taken aback and stood in front of him.
    "It's nothing!"
    "Tell me, what's the matter? Why are you crying if nothing's wrong?"
    "Liu Jujiang… … …!"
    "What about him?"
    "He, he said I can't fight and he wants to send me home!"
    "He's talking nonsense! What kind of talk is that?! I'll criticize him later. If you can't fight, you can learn, we'll be training soon, as long as you train hard!" Then the squad leader also said to him: "Don't listen to Liu Jujiang so much in the future. That comrade has only been liberated recently. Although he has some skills, his ideological consciousness is too poor! Fighting can be learned, as long as you work hard, you can definitely surpass him. Don't be discouraged, you must make a name for yourself."
    "Black Old Man" listened to the squad leader's words, was stunned for a while, smiled foolishly, and suddenly responded with an "Okay!" and stood up.
    After the training started, whether it was bayonet practice, aiming at triangles, throwing grenades, or assault exercises, "Black Old Man" was very diligent! At night, when everyone else was asleep, he was still turning around in bed. He would secretly get up in the middle of the night to practice stabbing with his rifle, stabbing more than fifteen hundred times. The entire company had only two straw targets, so he made one for himself. One day, the squad leader went to see him practicing stabbing, and saw that two pits had been trampled in front of the straw target. "Black Old Man" was sweating all over, and his two short arms were moving faster and faster! He hid a handful of incense in his satchel and aimed at the incense sticks after roll call every day. He threw a pile of stones in the corner of the courtyard, and every morning he would get up before dawn and throw dozens of stones before the bugle sounded. Behind their house were two short walls, he put a stick across the top and went to do hanging arm bends whenever he had time, moving his hands and feet. The four squad was about two hundred meters straight from the playground. He had to run back and forth every time at assembly, practicing charging and approaching. There was an outer trench outside the village, and he had to climb over it twice a day to practice crossing the ditch.
    After these two months of hard training, his movements became much quicker and more agile, his hunch seemed to have straightened out a little, he could do heavy work, his face was glowing red, and except when he was tired or early in the morning, the thick blue glow and dark aura he used to have on his face were no longer visible. Most importantly, his military skills had greatly improved. On the day of the big performance, he threw a grenade thirty-six and a half meters, only three and a half meters less than Liu Jujiang. The entire audience cheered and said, "Wow, Black Old Man has turned himself around!" The Fourth Squad, in great surprise, selected him as a "Training Model" during the summary.
    However, Liu Jujiang was still unconvinced and muttered behind his back: "Humph, being good at ordinary times doesn't count, he'll be confused as soon as he gets to the front line, and he'll forget everything. Just watch, isn't he just like Zhu Bajie going to heaven, stumbling around?!"
    Immediately afterward, the troops were ordered to participate in the siege of Tangyin. When "Black Old Man" heard that Tangyin City was full of local bullies and landlords, he got angry. He went in and out of the squad every day saying, "This time, we should deal with the landlords!" With the help of the squad leader, he formulated his own plan to kill the enemy. He announced it publicly at the squad meeting. After the meeting, Liu Jujiang said playfully, "This time, we're all watching our Black Old Man!"
    On May 1st, the general offensive against Tangyin City was launched. The Seventh Company was in the northwest of the city, and the Fourth Squad was responsible for erecting ladders. The tail end of the first ladder was carried by "Black Old Man". He crossed the ditch and set up the ladder in three minutes, allowing the assault team to successfully climb the city. When the troops approached the base of the city wall, it was covered with enemy machine guns, firing wildly, making it difficult for the Seventh Company to raise their heads. At this moment, a grenade flew from the front of the position and exploded on the city wall, destroying an enemy machine gun and creating an opportunity for the unit to bring its firepower to bear, breaking the stalemate. Everyone guessed wildly, "Whose grenade was thrown so high?" Looking down, it was "Black Old Man" crawling in front! In the final stage of the battle, the troops rushed into the city. "Black Old Man" was very brave, running and shouting to the wavering enemy troops: "Surrender!" He captured three enemies and got a Mosin-Nagant rifle and a Type 38 rifle. His leg was injured.
    From then on, no one in the Fourth Squad dared to look down on "Black Old Man" again. When he returned from the hospital, everyone shouted, "Zhang Changyi is back!" and jumped out of the door to meet him. Liu Jujiang shouted "Black Old Man!" and immediately blushed when he saw that no one was laughing.
    A day later, the superiors gave Zhang Changyi the beautiful Type 38 rifle he had earned. On the morning of the gun distribution, Zhang Changyi said: "Let Black Old Man carry the shovel again!" The whole squad laughed.
    On August 12th, the × Brigade held a hero meeting on the banks of the Qin River. A long string of comic strips of the Second Class Merit recipient Zhang Changyi were posted on the walls of the exhibition hall. The title of the last one was: "Black Old Man Becomes a Hero." The meaning of the picture is: The squad leader is holding a commendation form and wants Zhang Changyi to fill in the names of his family members so that he can send it home. Zhang Changyi thought for a while and wrote his mother's name. In addition, he asked the squad leader to write a note for him, according to his dictation, to his wife, so that he could send it back together. One sentence in that note was: "Don't worry, I'm much fatter than I was then, and the time to repay kindness and make contributions is still ahead!"

　　黑老汉成了英雄
    彦夫
  　（一）
    张长义是三十八团七连四班的一个新战士，今年才二十一岁。这同志长了个矮个子，瘦巴巴的，稍有点背锅，胳膊腿都比平常人短些，手脸都发黑，脸上还黑里带青，看人时两眼发楞，一做重活就喘气。班里一些调皮的战士给他起了个外号：“黑老汉！”
    “黑老汉”因为是新兵，身体又这么不壮实，部队上月从××往××开的时候，一路一直掉队。打鹿楼那晚上，他腿不带劲，连沟都过不去，抬梯子时跌在沟里了。扔手榴弹不上十五米，差点伤着自己人。不但起不了作用，反成了全班的累赘！这以后，他的枪被收回去了，行军时，给他扛一个军用铣，班上同志人人都说他前途不大，有些干脆说开埋怨话了，要求上级把他调出班去，后悔原来不该收他。
    部队在昔阳号召新战士入伍，那天后晌，“黑老汉来了”，弯着个腰，站在桌子前面，一直说：“写上我的名吧！”书记同志抬头一看，就又把头扭到别人那边去了。直到最后都验完了，北陵阳村来了八个人，都验上了，只有“黑老汉”验不上，人都走完了，他还端站在桌子前面，两眼圪溜着书记同志的脸：“写上我的名吧！”书记不耐烦的摆了下手：“快回去吧，你不行！看你那………！”
    “黑老汉”仍站着不动。
    书记后来费了好多神，劝了一番，才把他劝走了。
    “黑老汉”回去跟老婆抱头哭了一顿，第二天他又来了。这一回，他按着老婆的话，洗了洗脸手，扎紧了腰带，打扮干干净净，精精干干的，一进报名处的门，又那么往桌子前面一站。
    那个书记偏着头看了他一眼，心上象动了一下，但末了又把他的手摆了一下：“还不行！”旁边的人都笑了。
    “你今年多大了？”桌边另一个同志跟旁人不一样，却细问开他了。
    “十八！”“黑老汉”赶紧说，他按老婆的话瞒了三岁。
    “十八？”这同志又在他身上打量了一番，思忖了一下，才自言自语的说：“年岁还小，还能长，锻炼锻炼，也许还有点希望！”
    这时候，“黑老汉”混身轰的一下，象着了火，他高兴得连话都不会说了。
    “黑老汉”从此穿上军装，补充到七连了。
    但是，至今两月多了，他打仗不行，行军不行！连脚都站不住。大家最近正议论着给他些粮食，打发他回家去。
    他真有些着急，前些日连里治疥，他拚命在工作上努力，平常一见疥号，就自动过去给人家擦背擦胳膊，常常是两手黄膏子。做活时，拣重的做，那天在大雪下和了一天泥，给大家修澡塘。班上疥号的浓泡疥衣，丢在墙角里，他悄悄去给洗了，有一天洗了几身，天冷，没干，搭在房檐底下，他怕没了，坐在门口守了一夜。
    这些被大家发现后，同志们有些感动，但事情基本上似乎仍无好转，他看大家的神色，都象仍在议论他，象是仍要打发他回家，尤其刘居江那句话：“光能吃苦也不行！军队上开的是打仗的铺，还要会打仗哩，你不行！我看，哼，将来八分还不是回…………？”他老是忘不了。
    这一天擦黑，大家都正在游戏，他独个溜了回来，坐在门墩上流开眼泪了，他想起他痛苦的历史来了！
    “黑老汉”原生在昔阳北陵阳背后，大山腰里的一个小山庄上，爹是个长工，一年灾荒中饿死了，那时候，“黑老汉”十一岁，就出了破窑洞，和自己的小兄弟上到山顶去刨荒地，留下老娘在山底下讨着吃。
    这山上尽是石头，“黑老汉”和山上的穷人们一起混日子，全靠野菜过活，平常吃的是野猪菜，灰条菜，刺节菜，野苜蓿…………足有三十多种！还吃过白土。娘有时也送一些糠窝窝上来，顺便也看一看自己的儿子。有一回，母子见面时，一见自己的长义瘦成干柴了，娘哇的一声哭了，她说：“娃呀！你咋变成这样了？！”
    “黑老汉”日夜劳苦，好容易开出来一片荒地，第二年收了一些谷子，但是，山底下的老财又上来了。把收下的全拿走了，说这片地十年前就是他的。
    这一来，他娘连饿带气，害了一场病，殁了！埋时连一张席也没睡上。“黑老汉”弟兄两个不知流了多少眼泪，兄弟很快也病死了。但是，“黑老汉”心劲强，他决心再干下去，再在这山上活下去。
    他气愤不过，不要那片地了，又在大石块缝里刨起来，就这样长年垒月，风霜雨露，直到抗战大反攻，八路军解放昔阳城。十年的磨难，一个孩子就变成老汉了！
    八路军到后，“黑老汉”坚决闹斗争，很快翻了身，得了七亩地，半院瓦房，娶了个媳妇，把娘另埋了一下。后来听说顽固第三军到了石家庄，上头号召参军，他和媳妇商量了一番，决心要报共产党八路军的恩，要报名参军。
    可是如今大家说他不够格，要送他回家去。
    不能，他不能回家去！他一来要报恩，二来要打一打老财，为爹娘出口气！
    “黑老汉”这会越想牙咬得越紧，他死也不能回去，他一定要学会打仗！他扯起袖子正擦眼泪，忽见班长从大门外闪进来了。
    “为啥哭？”班长一楞，站在他面前了。
    “没啥！”
    “说说到底是咋的回事？没事为啥流眼泪？”
    “刘居江……！”
    “他怎么样？”
    “他，他说我不会打仗，要送我回家！”
    “他胡说！哪哩的话？！我一会批评他。不会打仗可以学嘛，咱马上就要整训了，只要你好好的练！”接着班长还对他说：“往后不要尽听刘居江的话，那同志刚解放过来不久，虽有些技术，思想意识太差！打仗是能学会的，只有你下苦工夫练，一定还能胜过他。你可不要泄气，一定要干出个名堂来。”
    “黑老汉”听了班长的话，楞了半会，痴痴的笑了笑，突然答应了一声：“对”就站起来了。
    练兵开始以后，不管刺草靶，瞄三角，投弹，攻坚演习，“黑老汉”都十分努力！晚上人家都睡着了，他还在床上转着身，半夜里悄悄起来去练习刺枪，直刺到一千五百多次，全连一共两个草靶，他单独给自己弄了一个，那天班长去看他刺枪，见草靶面前踏成了两个坑，“黑老汉”混身出汗，两个短胳膊越来越欢！他在挎包里藏了一把香，天天点名以后要瞄香头。他给院角里丢了一堆石块子，天天早晨摸黑起床，等到号声一响，他已经扔完了几十个石头。他们房背后有两个短墙，他给上头横了一根棍，一有空就去悬垂曲肘，活动手脚。四班到操场约有二百米的直路，集合时他一定要快跑个来回，练习冲锋抵近。村外面有一道外壕，他每天总要去扒两回，练习过沟。
    经过这两个月的苦练，他的动作迅速灵活得多了，背锅象是稍稍直了些，也能做重活了，脸上发开红光了，除了疲劳时和早起那一会，他的脸上再也看不见原先那种厚厚的青光和黑气了。最重要的是，他的军事技术大大的提高了，大表演那天，他手榴弹打到了三十六米半，只差刘居江三米半，全场齐声叫好，都说：“喝，黑老汉翻身了！”四班在大惊之下，总结时选了他当“练兵模范。”
    但是，刘居江仍不服气，背地里嘟哝道：“哼，平常好不算，一上火线就昏了，啥都忘了，看着吧，还不是猪八戒上天，乱栽跟头？！”
    紧接着，部队奉命参加围攻汤阴，“黑老汉”一听说汤阴城里藏满了恶霸地主，气就上来了，他一天出来进去在班里说：“这回可该干一下老财团了！”他在班长帮助下订出了自己的杀敌计划，在班务会上当众宣布了，会后，刘居江又调皮的说：“这回都看咱黑老汉的吧！”
    五月一日，汤阴城外发动了总攻，七连在城西北，四班担任架设，第一架梯子抬尾巴的是“黑老汉”，他在三分钟内过了沟架好了梯子，使突击队顺利的上了城。部队抵近城根时，城墙上遍布着敌人的机枪，疯狂射击，一时使七连不易抬头，这当口，一颗手榴弹从阵地前沿飞起，炸在城墙上，消灭了敌人一支机枪不响了，使自己的火力得到了发扬的机会，打开了僵局，大家都乱猜：“谁的炸弹打的这么高？”一伸下巴，爬在前面的正是“黑老汉”！战斗的最后阶段，部队向城内猛扑，“黑老汉”十分勇敢，一边跑，一边向动摇的敌群高喊：“缴枪！”连捉三个敌人，得了一支水连珠和一支三八式，他的腿负了伤。
    从此，四班再没人敢轻看“黑老汉”了。当他从医院回来的那天，大家乱喊：“张长义回来了！”都跳出门来接他，刘居江喊了一声“黑老汉！”一看没一个人笑，马上就脸红了。
    过了一天，上级把张长义得的那支漂亮的三八式给了他，发枪那早晨，张长义说：“叫我黑老汉再扛铣吧”全班都笑了。
    八月十二日，×旅在沁河岸边召开群英大会，二等功臣张长义的连环画，在展览室的墙壁上贴了一长串，最后一张的标题是：“黑老汉成了英雄。”画意是：班长拿着一张报功状，要张长义填上家长的姓名，好给他寄回家去，张长义想了下，写上了他娘的名字。另外，他请班长替他记，由他说，给媳妇写一个条条，好一块捎回去，那条子当中有一句是：“莫结记，我比那会胖多了，报恩立功的时候还在后头哩！”
