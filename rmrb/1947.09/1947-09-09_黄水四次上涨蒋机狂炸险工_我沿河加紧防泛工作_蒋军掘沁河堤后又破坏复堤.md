　　[Xinhua News Agency, Jinji Luyu, 7th] The Yellow River's water level rose again on the evening of September 2nd. By the morning of the 3rd, the water level had increased by two meters. This is the fourth rise in water since the major flood (note: the first was from July 26th to August 3rd, the second from August 16th to 22nd, and the third from August 28th to 29th). The water has now left the channel, and some villages within the riverbed have been flooded. Although there have been continuous autumn rains in recent days, Chiang Kai-shek's planes continue to bomb dangerously weak sections of the river dykes. The situation is extremely critical. The Yellow River Committee has notified all repair and defense sections to intensify flood prevention work and be prepared to deal with any emergencies. On the night of August 30th, seven flood prevention farmers from the Wangmachang Dyke in the Third District of Puyang County, while patrolling the dyke to monitor the water level, were suddenly attacked by several armed special agents of Chiang Kai-shek. Five people were killed, one was seriously injured, and only one escaped. The Yellow River Committee has notified all flood prevention personnel on the dykes to be highly vigilant against Chiang's special agents sabotaging the dykes and assassinating people, and is actively searching for Chiang's special agents.
   [This newspaper, Taihang, 5th] After Chiang's puppet troops dug up and destroyed the Dafan Dyke of the Qin River in Wuzhi County, they took advantage of the flooding to carry out a frenzied "joint sweep," attempting to disperse our dyke-repairing masses, eliminate the local people's armed forces, and cut off the connection between the Xiu(wu), Huo(jia), and Wu(zhi) triangle area and the liberated area hinterland. The Wuzhi County Democratic Government and cadres of various systems, under the vow of "sharing life and death with the people of Xiuwu and Wuzhi," actively organized the masses to resolutely rush to plug the Qin River dyke, and formed people's self-defense work teams to wage a tenacious guerrilla war in the grid area with the enemy, to cover the repair of the dyke and protect the lives and property of the masses. The local disaster-stricken masses, after receiving relief from our democratic government, actively participated in the dyke repair and assisted the work teams in combat, so that the plugging work could be completed as soon as possible. They said: "Thief Chiang: If you want to drown us, we will drive you away!" On the 19th of last month, when the Huojia puppet security regiment invaded Dongxiaowu Village, it was encircled and annihilated by a certain detachment of Huojia, killing, wounding, and capturing 38 enemy soldiers including the company commander.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Jinji Luyu, 5th] Following the digging and destruction of the Dafan Dyke of the Qin River in Wuzhi County, northern Henan, on the night of August 20th, the Chiang's army on the opposite bank of Wen County took advantage of the sudden surge in the Yellow River water level in that section, with the water head increasing by two feet, and shelled the Yellow River dyke near Xiaozheng Village in Wen County on the north bank from across the river. The dyke was destroyed by the shelling, and the Yellow River water flowed out of the dyke, immediately submerging the surrounding farmland and houses. The masses risked their lives to rush to plug the breach, but were dispersed by the shelling of the Chiang's army on the opposite bank. Currently, the local democratic government is providing relief to the disaster-stricken masses and organizing the masses to rush to plug the breach.

　　黄水四次上涨蒋机狂炸险工
  　我沿河加紧防泛工作
    蒋军掘沁河堤后又破坏复堤
    【新华社晋冀鲁豫七日电】黄河水势九月二日晚又形上涨，至三日晨，水位增长二公尺，此为大泛以来第四次涨水（按：第一次为七月二十六日至八月三日，第二次为八月十六至二十二日，第三次为八月二十八至廿九日）。现水已出槽，河床内村庄，已有部分被淹。近日虽秋雨连绵，蒋机仍继续狂炸各河堤险工，形势极为危急，黄委会已通知各修防段，加紧防泛工作，随时准备抢险。八月三十日深夜，我濮县三区王马厂堤屋之七名防泛农民，沿堤巡逻水势之际，突遭蒋记武装特务数名袭击，五人被害，一人重伤，仅一人幸免。黄委会已通知各堤岸防泛人员，严密警惕蒋特破坏堤坝与暗杀。并积极搜捕蒋特。
    【本报太行五日电】蒋伪掘毁武陟沁河大樊堤后，乘水泛滥进行疯狂的“合击扫荡”，企图驱散我复堤群众，消灭当地人民武装，隔断我修（武）、获（嘉）、武（陟）三角地带与解放区腹地的联系。武陟县民主政府，及各系统干部，在“和修获武人民同生死共患难”的誓言下，积极组织群众坚决抢堵沁河堤，并组成人民自卫武工队在格子网内与敌展开顽强的游击战争，掩护复堤，保卫群众的生命财产。当地被灾群众，获得我民主政府的救济后，纷纷参加复堤及协助武工队作战使抢堵工作得以早日完成。他们说：“贼老蒋：你要淹死我们，我们就要赶走你！”上月十九日，当获嘉伪保安团进犯我东小吴村时，即为我获嘉某支队围歼，计毙伤俘敌中队长以下三十八名。
    【新华社晋冀鲁豫五日电】豫北蒋军继掘毁武陟沁河大樊堤后，八月二十日夜温县对岸蒋军复乘该段黄水暴涨，水头激增二尺之际，隔岸炮轰北岸温县小郑庄附近黄河堤坝，该堤当被轰毁，黄水滔滔出堤，顿时水头过腹，附近庄稼及房屋全部淹没冲毁，群众冒险抢堵，均被对岸蒋军发炮驱散，现当地民主政府正一面救济被灾群众，一面组织群众抢堵中。
