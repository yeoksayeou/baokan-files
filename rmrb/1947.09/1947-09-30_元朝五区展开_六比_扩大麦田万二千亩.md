    [Report from this newspaper, Jinnan, 28th] The Yuan Dynasty Fifth District has launched "Six Comparisons" to prepare intensively for wheat planting. Since Wen Jianshu proposed "Six Comparisons" (more planting, earlier planting, deep plowing, meticulous weeding, more fertilizer, more wheat harvest) and challenged Wen Xueshi, the entire district has launched a "Six Comparisons Movement." On September 4th, men and women throughout the district made a concentrated effort to collect fertilizer grass, creating 2,150 cartloads of manure. Because there was no green grass in Fu Donggu, the masses climbed trees to pick hazel leaves, and women and children went to the fields to cut daylily seedlings, collecting 1,200 jin in one day. The plan is to plant 59,000 mu of wheat, and 43,000 cartloads of fertilizer have already been created, with efforts being made to create another 20,000 cartloads by the time of wheat planting. Villages are seizing the gaps in the autumn harvest to pave roads and build bridges, with large and small carts transporting fertilizer to the fields. Fu Donggu built two bridges, and all the fertilizer has been delivered. The masses in Shanyue rushed to deliver fertilizer during the rain, and in five days, all 43,000 cartloads of fertilizer in the district were delivered. After the leadership proposed "collective cattle feeding," more than 200 livestock were added throughout the district, with each livestock averaging 29 mu of cultivated land. The entire district can plant 74 percent of the wheat (59,000 mu), and Gaozhuang can plant wheat on more than 75 percent of the village's land area. The entire district is planting 12,000 mu more than last year. Based on the district's human and animal power conditions, the call is for "deep plowing and meticulous cultivation," using the experience of the newly emerging rich peasant Wen Xueshi to educate the masses. The land is shoveled and hoeed once before planting, the soil is sun-dried, harrowed once, and then fertilizer is applied before plowing. Each mu of harvest is worth half a cartload of fertilizer. If it is harrowed three times after plowing, the wheat seedlings will not be afraid of mole crickets. Currently, careful cultivation of early-planted land is being carried out in various villages. Last year, the Ma Chen sub-district plowed three inches deep; this year, they are plowing four inches deep.

    元朝五区展开“六比”
    扩大麦田万二千亩
    【本报冀南二十八日电】元朝五区展开“六比”，紧张准备种麦。自文建书向文学诗提出“六比”（多种、早种、深耕、细锄、多上粪、多收麦），挑战条件后，全区便展开了“六比运动”，九月四日，全区男女突击肥草，造粪二千一百五十车，傅东固因没有青草，群众上树拨榛叶，妇女儿童到地里割金针苗，一天弄了一千二百斤。共打算种麦五万九千亩，现已造粪四万三千车，争取到种麦时再造粪二万车。各村抓紧秋收空隙垫路、搭桥，大车小车往地里送粪，傅东固搭了两个桥，粪已全部送完。山岳群众下雨赶送，五天工夫全区四万三千车粪已全部送完。领导上提出“伙喂牛”后，全区增添牲口二百多个，每个牲口平均耕地二十九亩，全区能种麦百分之七十四（五万九千亩），高庄能种麦占全村土地面积百分之七十五强。全区比去年多种一万二千亩。根据全区人畜力条件提出“深耕细作”，用新兴富农文学诗的经验教育群众，种地先后铲剿一遍，晒晒地皮，耙一遍，再上粪犁地，每亩收成顶上半车粪，要是犁好后连耙三遍，麦苗不怕蝼蛄。现各村普遍进行早茬地细耕，马陈小区去年犁三寸深，今年犁四寸深。
