[Report from our Jinnan Office on the 17th] In Weixian Ninth District, men and women are working together to harvest the autumn crops, turn the soil, and accumulate manure. The entire district plans to plant over 30,000 mu of wheat, with each mu receiving two cartloads of manure. Under the slogan of "Harvest autumn crops well, plant wheat early," all villages are busy with harvesting, turning the soil, and accumulating manure. Thirty-four villages have 1,588 animal power and 7,084 human power units. Eight villages, based on mutual assistance, have implemented large-scale labor exchange for people and animals. In Xihekou, there were not enough cattle for plowing, so women pushed the stone rollers, and men used carts to transport manure, freeing up the cattle to plow the land twice. After distributing the floating wealth in Ganji, poor peasants bought 30 cattle together. In the remaining 26 villages, under the leadership of village cadres and with mutual assistance, men and women are working together, busy with autumn harvest, manure accumulation, and soil turning. For example, in Xingwutun, women pushed soil, carried water, and trampled in manure pits. The entire Jingang family group went to the fields to thresh sorghum, pick cotton, and cut millet. While busily harvesting the autumn crops, they also seized the time to accumulate manure. The 34 villages plan to plant 35,864 mu of wheat, exceeding one-half of the total wheat acreage planted last year. Currently, 63,872 cartloads of manure have been accumulated, with two cartloads of manure per mu of wheat land. There is still a shortage of 7,856 cartloads. Each village must resolutely complete the shortfall within one month. For example, Ganji plans to accumulate another 250 cartloads of manure, and Xingwutun can also complete 110 cartloads. In order to complete the manure accumulation task, Xiaowangqu and other places have put up signs on all manure pits. The manure inspection committee checks each manure pit every day, and broadcasts the names of manure accumulation heroes and model groups in the evening, which greatly boosts the morale of the masses.

[Report from our Taiyue Office on the 17th] In Wuyuan, Tunliu, a campaign to cut artemisia and ferment manure and award merit has been launched. In three days, a total of more than 54,000 catties of artemisia were cut, and 36 people were commended and rewarded. On the rainy night of August 28, Wuyuan, Tunliu, mutually agreed that those who fermented 25 loads of manure per day were considered first-class labor, and those with even greater achievements would receive additional credit. Then, after researching where their food came from, the merchants also organized 30 full laborers, 32 half laborers, and 210 peasant full and half laborers, as well as children, women, and old women, totaling 441 people, to launch a vigorous artemisia cutting campaign. From August 28 to September 1, a total of 54,290 catties of chopped artemisia were produced. The merchants' method of fermenting manure was to cut artemisia while sweeping the streets. For example, the West Street cleaned out seven or eight years of old manure from the shops and gave it to the mutual aid groups to use on the land. On the 6th, more than 400 people from the whole village held a meeting to celebrate the achievements. Hou Sannv, Wang Xiaoer, Han Jingyun, and the merchant Du Qiuxi all received award banners. In addition, 32 people received congratulatory sickles. The entire village is now preparing to sow wheat on the 110 mu of wasteland that has been turned over.
