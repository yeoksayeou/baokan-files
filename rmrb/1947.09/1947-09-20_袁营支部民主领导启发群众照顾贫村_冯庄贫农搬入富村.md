[Report from this newspaper, Jilu Yu, 18th] The Yuan Ying Village branch in the eighth district of Boping utilizes democratic means and follows the mass line to lead the rational resolution of issues between poor and wealthy villages. Yuan Ying Village is a prosperous village, while Man Ying Village is a poor one. The masses of Man Ying Village requested assistance from Yuan Ying Village. Therefore, Yuan Ying convened a branch meeting. The branch secretary explained that poor people everywhere are one family, and it is the Party's call for wealthy villages to care for poor villages, and that Party members must ensure this call is transformed into the opinion of the masses. Then, a mass meeting was held for discussion and deliberation, and the result was unanimous agreement to care for Man Ying. Only the women's association disagreed. The branch secretary then said: We want democracy and cannot coerce the masses. Let's convene a mass meeting of both Yuan Ying and Man Ying villages to discuss. The next day, at the mass meeting of the two villages, the masses of Man Ying pointed out that many poor people from their village work in Yuan Ying as laborers and do odd jobs, suffering exploitation from the landlords of Yuan Ying. The masses of Man Ying further lamented, "In the years of famine, five out of eleven laborers from our village working in Yuan Ying starved to death." After the grievances of the masses of Man Ying, the thinking of the women in Yuan Ying was straightened out. Finally, it was decided to help Man Ying with items such as a water mill and a hundred pieces of clothing.

[Report from this newspaper, Jilu Yu, 18th] The second district of Boping broke down the boundaries between poor and wealthy villages and implemented a large-scale relocation of poor peasants. Fengzhuang in that district had no landlords. It was a poor village where poor peasants could not thoroughly turn over. The village cadre of Fujicun said to the village cadre of Fengzhuang: "We welcome the poor peasants of your village to move to our village." After the village cadre of Fengzhuang returned, they mobilized the poor peasants to move to Fujicun. At that time, the poor peasant Feng Lanjie said: "People from a small village will be bullied when they live in a large village." The village cadre explained to him that poor people everywhere are one family and will not be bullied, and the masses of Fujicun were very welcoming. Only then did Feng Lanjie decide to move. The next day, the masses of Fujicun cleaned three good houses, pasted red couplets, and hung up Chairman Mao's portrait, and the landlord carried the chairs, and the landlord's wife carried the fan, playing instruments to welcome Feng Lanjie home. The women's association and children of Fengzhuang also warmly sent them off, and the women's association and children of Fujicun all came out to greet them and congratulate Feng Lanjie, and the village gave him wheat, grain, quilts, bedding, three mu of good paddy fields, etc. Six households on West Street in Chengguan also signed up and moved to North Street and Beiguan. On the same day, North Street helped clean the houses and solved all difficulties.

　　袁营支部民主领导启发群众照顾贫村
  　冯庄贫农搬入富村
    【本报冀鲁豫十八日电】博平八区袁营村支部，放手民主走群众路线，领导合理解决贫富村问题。袁营村是个富村，蛮营是个贫村，蛮营群众提出要袁营村照顾，因此袁营便召开支部会，支部书记说明天下穷人是一家，富村照顾穷村是党号召，党员要保证将这一号召变为群众意见。接着召开群众会进行讨论酝酿，结果都同意照顾蛮营，只有妇女会里不同意。支部书记便说：咱要民主，不能强迫群众，咱们召集袁营、蛮营两村群众来讨论。第二天，在两村的群众大会上，蛮营群众提出俺庄贫民在袁营扛活打短工的很多，受袁营地主的剥削。蛮营群众更哭诉着说：“在灾荒年，俺庄在袁营十一个扛活的就饿死了五个。”经过蛮营群众的诉苦，袁营妇女思想打通了，最后决定把水磨一盘，衣服百件等物品帮助蛮营。
    【本报冀鲁豫十八日电】博平二区打破贫富村的界线，实行贫农大搬家。该区冯庄没有地主，是个穷村贫农不能彻底翻身，傅集的村干便对冯庄村干说：“欢迎你村的贫农搬到俺村住。”冯庄村干回去后，动员贫农搬到傅集。当时贫农冯兰杰说：“小庄人到大庄住要受气。”村干便向他解释，天下穷人是一家，不会受气，傅集群众很欢迎，冯兰杰才决定搬家。第二天傅集群众把三间好房子打扫干净，贴上红对字，挂上毛主席像，叫地主抬着椅子，地主老婆拿着扇子，吹打着乐器去接冯兰杰到家。冯庄妇会儿童也热烈欢送，傅集妇女农会儿童都出来迎接，并向冯兰杰道喜，村上给他麦子、谷子、被、褥、好谷地三亩等。城关西街也有六家报名，搬到北街和北关、当天北街帮助打扫房子，并解决一切困难。
