Autumn Tree Wall Branch
　　Promotes Leadership to Expand Wheat Fields

　　[Reported by our newspaper from Licheng] The Qiushuyuan Village in the Third District held a branch meeting one night last month to study the expansion of wheat fields, long-term preparedness for famine, and increased grain production, resulting in the following methods: 1. Based on the previous period of the vegetable planting and weeding movement, the Party members played a considerable role, promoting the expansion of vegetable planting by more than 600 mu in the village. The masses reflected: "Listening to Chairman Mao's leadership is never wrong. Now the vegetables are growing taller than chopsticks, which is really great." The branch absorbed this reflection and realized after research that this was mainly the result of the branch's promotion and the Party members' lead. Therefore, in this mobilization to expand wheat fields, Party members still set an example. 2. Clarify the focus and break the paralysis from checking weeding. According to the preliminary inspection of weeding and fertilizer accumulation a few days ago, it was found that there were still more than 100 mu of land in the village that had been weeded once and then abandoned. A mass meeting was held, using facts to break the masses' old saying that "there is no abandoned field after weeding," and proposed: "Eliminate wasteland and prepare to convert more land to wheat." In this way, on the one hand, the current weeding and wasteland elimination work was promoted, and on the other hand, the foundation for expanding wheat fields and converting to wheat was laid. 3. Calculate family assets and formulate plans, using mass slogans to open up the masses' minds. The mutual aid team led by the branch secretary, Li Chongqi, and the team led by a certain Party member, a farmer said: "The harvest in autumn is not as good as that in summer. Planting in autumn waits until next autumn, and planting in summer can be harvested in May next year. Preparing for famine can also be connected, so it is best to plant more wheat." This opened up everyone's minds. The ××× Party member mutual aid team has now converted more than half of its autumn land to wheat. 4. Vigorously accumulating fertilizer is the key to expanding wheat fields. This is based on the lessons of previous years. When expanding wheat fields, mobilizing people to plant more wheat, some people always say that they have no fertilizer and will not plant it. Therefore, this year, this point was grasped in advance. Therefore, when the weeding was about to be completed, the branch planned to organize a fertilizer accumulation movement, totaling 2,158 loads of Artemisia grass fertilizer, 5,330 loads of sheep fertilizer, and more than 320 dan of pigeon fertilizer swept by Rongjun Duan Wenyuan. Each mutual aid group also formulated specific fertilizer collection plans and methods. 5. Grasp the poor and hired peasant activists. In the work of the branch in the first half of the year, especially during drought prevention, famine preparedness, watering seedlings, and sowing vegetables, it was deeply experienced that grasping the poor and hired peasant activists is a powerful foundation for promoting work. This is what every Party member feels. Therefore, this time, expanding wheat fields, calculating family assets, and formulating plans also used this experience. For example, a certain Party member helped a certain emancipated farmer in his group to formulate a plan, mobilizing him to plant more wheat and harvest more grain to prepare for famine, and promoted him to plant two more mu of wheat. The emancipated farmer also said that he would expand the wheat field and lay a foundation for "cultivating three and saving one." Because the branch grasped these points, it smoothly promoted the expansion of wheat fields. The number of mu planted with wheat exceeded any year in history. The year with the most wheat planting was 1943, with more than 900 mu. This year, the current plan is more than 1,000 mu. At present, in addition to leading the elimination of wasteland, plowing wheat fields, and accumulating fertilizer, the village branch is organizing various mutual aid teams to prepare 169 wheat seeds, planting more high-quality crops, and harvesting more grain for long-term famine preparedness.

　　秋树垣支部
  　推动领导扩大麦田
    【本报黎城讯】三区秋树垣村在上月某夜召开支部会，研究扩大麦地，长期备荒，增产粮食，得出以下几种办法：一、根据前一段撒菜锄苗运动，党员起了相当作用，推动全村扩大种菜六百余亩，群众反映说：“听毛主席领导就没错，现在菜长的比筷子高的多了，真好。”支部把这个反映吸收起，研究后认识这主要是支部推动，党员带头的结果，所以这次扩大麦田动员中，党员仍以身作则起模范。二、从检查锄苗中明确中心，打破麻痹心理。据前几天的锄苗积肥初步检查，发现全村还有百余亩锄过一次又荒了的地，召开群众会，用事实打破群众中“过锄没荒田”麻痹思想旧说法，提出：“消灭荒地，准备多改麦”，这样一面推动了当前锄苗消灭荒地工作，一面打下扩大麦田改麦基础。三、算家当订计划，用群众口号打通群众思想。支书、李崇奇领导的互助队及某党员领导的队有一农民说：“三秋不如一夏，种秋等到明年秋，种夏明年五月就能收，备荒也能接口，多种麦最好。”打通了大家思想，×××党员互助队，现单改麦即超过秋地半数以上。四、大力积肥是扩大麦田的关节。这是根据往年教训，在扩大麦地时，动员多种麦，总有些人说没肥，不种啦，所以今年事先抓住这点，因此，支部在锄苗将完时，就有计划的组织了积肥运动，计沤蒿肥二千一百五十八驮，羊肥五千三百三十驮，荣军段文彦扫鸽肥三百二十多担，各互助组也订出具体集肥计划与办法。五、掌握贫雇农积极分子。支部在前半年工作中，特别是防旱备荒浇苗撒菜时，深深体验到掌握贫雇积极分子是推动工作有力基础，这是每个党员都感到的，所以这次扩大麦田算家当订计划，也运用了这个经验。如某党员帮助他组某翻身农民订计划，动员他多种麦，多打粮能备荒，推动他多种了二亩麦，该翻身农民并且说还要扩大麦田，也给耕三余一打下个基础。该支部由于掌握了这几点，所以很顺利推动了扩大麦田，种麦亩数之多，超过了历史上任何一年，四三年是种麦最多一年，种了九百多亩，今年现计划就有千余亩。目前该村支部除领导消灭荒地犁麦地积肥外，正组织各互助队准备一六九小麦种籽，多种优良作物，更多打粮长期备荒。（芳芹）
