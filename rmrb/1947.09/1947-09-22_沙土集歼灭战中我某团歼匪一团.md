Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 19th: In the battle where the People's Liberation Army completely annihilated the Chiang bandit 57th Division at Shatuji, a certain regiment annihilated the bandit 12th Regiment single-handedly, creating a model battle example. This regiment, in coordination with fraternal units, cleared five enemy strongholds east of Shatuji after a day and night of fierce fighting, compressing the enemy to the Xuzhuang and Suzhuang line. At 1:00 AM on the 7th, taking advantage of the Chiang bandits' panic, the regiment launched a general attack on the enemy 57th Division's 60th Brigade, 12th Regiment in Xuzhuang with lightning speed. Instantly, the Xuzhuang stronghold became a sea of fire, and the Chiang bandits dared not even stick their heads out of their fortifications. Amidst continuous earth-shattering explosions, Ge Baoxiang, the platoon leader of the 3rd Platoon of the 4th Company, serving as the assault team, charged into the enemy ranks with a machine gun, pursuing and annihilating the defeated enemy with the momentum of a tiger pouncing on a sheep. The Chiang bandits, unable to turn back, raised their guns and surrendered. The entire company pursued and attacked fiercely, leaping over three walls in succession, capturing more than 150 Chiang bandits alive at the cost of only seven wounded. At this time, other companies of the regiment also rushed into the village one after another. After five counterattacks failed, the Chiang bandits charged wildly in the streets and alleys. Some were immediately annihilated by the People's Liberation Army in the village, and the remnants who fled to the vicinity of Shatuji were also mostly annihilated in the swamps.

Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 19th: Reporter Xue Wen reports: One afternoon, the reporter met Zhang Yubin, the captured Chiang bandit 57th Division's 117th Brigade Colonel Deputy Brigade Commander, at the battlefield of Shatuji. According to him, regarding the annihilation of the 57th Division, he said: "For more than a month, we followed the Liberation Army in circles from the Yilu Mountain area to southwestern Shandong, always in a passive position, and the soldiers were already exhausted. This time, we were ordered to coordinate with the Fifth Army (i.e., the Reorganized Fifth Division) in attacking Yuncheng. When my division advanced to the southern suburbs of Yuncheng, we heard that your army (referring to the Liberation Army) had already detoured to the south. We were immediately forced to retreat, but we were surrounded by your army on all sides before we even gained a foothold at Shatuji. At that time, we planned to break through in the direction of Heze, but we dared not act rashly. We knew very well that if we were not surrounded by your army, it would be fine, but once surrounded, we would be unable to escape. On the evening of the 7th, your army began attacking our southeastern outer strongholds. By the next morning, except for Weijiazhuang, all had been occupied by your army, and the 60th Brigade had suffered nearly half casualties. On the 8th, the entire division was compressed into a group. Regiment Commander Ma of the 349th Regiment telegraphed Brigade Commander (Luo Jueyuan) asking 'What should we do?' Brigade Commander Luo replied 'I have no idea.' At noon, everyone was busy digging holes, fearing your army's artillery fire, resulting in large and small holes all over the street. The division headquarters commanders hid in the holes, not even daring to show their heads. At 7:00 PM, your army's various cannons began to bombard Shatuji. With each cannon shot, at least a dozen of us (referring to the Chiang bandits) were killed or wounded. The shelling was most intense after 7:30 PM, with shells raining down like rain. We (referring to the Chiang bandits) were screaming and horses were neighing in the village. Those killed were lying on the ground and trampled upon, and those alive were running around in fright. But our (referring to the Chiang bandits) cannons were already silent, the gunners were nowhere to be found, and the gun carriages were crowded with people hiding from the artillery fire. Commanders could not find soldiers, and company commanders could not find battalion commanders, creating utter chaos. Around 9:00 PM, your army had already rushed into the streets from the east and west gates, and our soldiers (referring to the Chiang bandits) knelt down and begged for surrender. The division headquarters commanders, led by Regiment Commander Ma, fled to the southwest, but I was captured just two or three hundred meters away after crossing the earthen embankment." Zhang added sadly in the end: "An army without fighting spirit is bound to be defeated." Zhang is currently 46 years old, a graduate of the fourth class of the Huangpu Military Academy, and has been in the military for 21 years.

    沙土集歼灭战中我某团歼匪一团
    【新华社华东前线十九日电】解放军于沙土集全歼蒋匪五十七师之役中，某团单独歼灭匪第十二团，创模范战例。该团协同兄弟部队经一日夜激战扫清沙土集东则五个据点后，将敌人压缩至徐庄，苏庄一线。七日午夜一时，该团乘蒋匪惊魂未定，即以闪电之势，向徐庄敌五十七师六十旅十二团发起总攻。顿时徐庄据点即成火海，蒋匪躲在工事里连头也不敢伸。在天崩地裂的连续爆炸声中，担任突击队的四连三排长葛宝祥端起一挺机枪率领突击排突入敌阵，以猛虎扑羊之势追歼败敌，不及回头的蒋匪纷纷举枪求降。全连急追猛扑，连续跃过三道墙院，仅以七人负伤之代价，于十五分钟内生擒蒋匪百五十余名。此时该团其他连队亦相继冲进圩子，蒋匪反扑五次，失败后，乃于街巷中乱冲乱撞，一部立即被解放军歼灭于圩内，溃逃至沙土集附近的残匪，亦大部被歼于泥沼中。
    【新华社华东前线十九日电】记者薛文报导：某日午后记者于战地会见沙土集被俘之蒋匪五十七师一一七旅上校副旅长张毓彬，据彼谈五十七师之被歼经过称：“一个多月以来我们从沂鲁山区到鲁西南跟着解放军转圈子，始终处于被动地位，士兵都已经拖得疲惫不堪了。这次我们奉命策应五军（即整编第五师）进攻郓城，当我师进至郓城南郊时，即听说贵军（指解放军）已迂回向南，当即被迫后撤，但刚到沙土集还没站稳脚就被贵军四面包围了。当时曾打算向菏泽方向突围，但又不敢轻易行动。我们深知不被贵军包围则已，一被包围便插翅难飞。七日深夜贵军向我东南外围据点开始攻击，翌晨除魏介庄已全部为贵军占领，六十旅伤亡近半，八日全师都被压缩成一团，三四九团马团长电问（罗觉元）旅长‘这样如何是好’？罗旅长回答‘我也没有办法。’中午，大家慑于贵军炮火忙着挖地洞，弄得满街都是大洞小洞，师部指挥官躲在洞里连头都不敢露。到晚上七点钟，贵军各种炮开始向沙土集轰击，每响一炮，我们（按指蒋匪）至少就死伤十几个人。七点半以后炮击最猛烈，炮弹象下雨一样，我们在圩里人喊马叫，打死的躺在地上被践踏，活着的吓得到处乱窜。而我们（指蒋匪）的大炮却早已鸦雀无声，炮手也已不知去向，炮身下挤满了躲炮火的人。指挥官找不到士兵，连长找不到营长，乱成一团糟。至九点多钟，贵军已由东西两门冲进街道，我们的士兵（指蒋匪）便纷纷跪下求降。师部指挥官等由马团长率领向西南逃命，不料刚翻过土围二三百米远，我即被俘了。”张氏最后凄然地补充了一句：“兵无斗志，必败无疑”。张现年四十六岁，黄埔军校四期毕业，从军已二十一年。
