Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 7th. Due to the dumping of American goods and a decrease in exports, the total amount of imports in the Chiang-controlled areas increased sharply in June. According to a Reuters dispatch from Shanghai on the 2nd, the import and export statistics released by the Chiang Kai-shek Customs stated: the total export value of the Chiang-controlled areas in June was 267 billion yuan, or 22.25 million US dollars (calculated at the official exchange rate of 12,000 yuan to the US dollar at the time, the same below), a decrease of nearly 35% compared to May; the total import value in June was 532 billion yuan, or more than 44.3 million US dollars (a large number of smuggled goods and relief supplies are not included), an increase of 110 billion Chiang currency compared to May. Almost all imports were American goods. According to the US Department of Commerce, US exports to China in May were 41.4 million US dollars (including relief supplies, the same below), and increased to 55.5 million US dollars in June. In May, the exports of the Chiang-controlled areas accounted for four-fifths of the imports, while in June the exports were only half of the imports, with a trade deficit of 265 billion yuan, and a loss of more than 22 million US dollars in foreign exchange, an increase of more than double compared to the trade deficit of 106 billion yuan in May. The decreased export commodities in the Chiang-controlled areas in June included major export commodities such as bristles and tung oil, and most of the others were textiles. American imports to China, cotton, accounted for half of the total, and oil also increased. Shanghai imports accounted for 63% of the total, followed by Guangzhou and Kowloon.

　　蒋管区美货泛滥六月份入超骤增
    【新华社陕北七日电】六月份蒋管区国防贸易，因美货倾销进口剧增，而出口则日见衰落。据路透社上海二日电报导蒋记海关发表之进出口统计称：蒋管区六月份出口总额为两千六百七十亿元，即二千二百二十五万美元（以当时美汇官价一万二折算，下同）较五月份减少几达百分之三十五；六月份进口总额为五千三百二十亿元，即四千四百三十余万美元（大量走私及救济物资未计入），较五月增加达蒋币一百一十亿元。进口几全部为美国货，据美商务部宣布：美对华输出五月份为四千一百四十万美元（包括救济物资，下同），六月份即增为五千五百五十万美元。五月份蒋管区出口尚为进口之五分之四，而六月份出口已仅及进口之一半，入超为二千六百五十亿元，而丧失外汇二千二百余万美元，较之五月份入超之一千零六十亿元增加达一倍以上。蒋管区六月份减少之出口品有素占主要输出品之猪鬃、桐油等，其他大部为纺织品。美国输华物品棉花即占总数一半，油类也有增加，上海进口占总额百分之六十三，其次为广州及九龙。
