　　She County Shahe Village
  　Implements Control of Landlords
    [Report from our newspaper in She County] During the rectification of mutual aid in Shahe Village, it was discovered that the reason mutual aid was not effective was due to the landlords sabotaging it from within. Landlord Niu Zhiqing said: "The Eighth Route Army is just talking. They say production leads to wealth and labor starts a family without struggle. Who didn't get rich through production? In the future, no one will escape being struggled against." Also, Wang Suoting, a landlord from Zexiang, secretly cut down two peach trees that had been liquidated by the masses in the spring. The masses realized that the landlords had not truly lowered their heads, that peasants and landlords are not one family, and firmly proposed to separate from the landlords and carry out "squeezing out feudalism" within mutual aid. This time, Shahe Village "squeezed out" thirty-five landlords and special agents, and the masses discussed management methods for these landlords and special agents.

    [Report from our newspaper in Wu Township] The county government launched a movement to examine thought and examine standpoint. On August 30th, a meeting of government organs was convened, and Sun Yunjie (Deputy Section Chief of the Finance Section), a "metamorphosed landlord," was "squeezed out" through thought comparison. According to Sun's own account: before the War of Resistance, he participated in the Kuomintang secret service and worked in the general affairs organ in Beiping. He also received training from Yan Xishan's "Great Village Chief" and served as the "Great Compilation Village Chief" in Zhongcun. After the War of Resistance began, he exploited loopholes to work in the anti-Japanese government. Since the land reform last winter, Sun has been extremely dissatisfied, complaining that the government does not take care of his family, and falsely using the government's name to protect Liu Fengchang in his section, preventing him from returning home to respond to the demands of the masses. Through thought comparison, everyone realized that Sun has consistently held a landlord standpoint and should be expelled from government service and handed back to the village for handling.

　　涉县沙河村
  　实行管制地主
    【本报涉县讯】沙河村整顿互助时，找出了互助不起劲的原因还有地主在里给破坏着。地主牛治庆说：“八路军光说哩，生产致富劳动起家不斗争，谁不是生产富了的，将来谁也饶不了挨斗。”并有择莺＠地主王所庭春天被群众清算的桃树，这时他又去砍死了两个。群众认识了地主还没真正低了头，农民与地主不是一家人，坚决提出要与地主分家，在互助里进行了挤封建。沙河这次挤出地主特务三十五个，并由群众讨论了对地主特务的管理办法。

    【本报武乡讯】县政府开展检查思想检查立场运动。八月三十号召开机关大会，从比思想中挤出化形地主孙云久（财政科副科长）。据孙自称：在抗战前曾参加国特到北平总务机关工作，又受阎锡山大村长训练，在中村当大编村村长，抗战开始钻空子到抗日政府工作；去冬土地改革以来，孙极表不满，瞒怨政府不照顾家庭，并假借政府名义，包庇科内刘凤昌不让回家答复群众要求；从比思想中大家认识孙一贯是地主立场，应开除政籍，交回村内处理。（李芳）
