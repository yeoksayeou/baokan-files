　　Ballad Under the Lamp
    Li Zhu
    Outside the latticed window, the moonlight is a sheet of silver,
    Inside the window, it's quiet as if no one's there,
    A hemp rope and a needle,
    An oil lamp burning late into the night.

    Zhang's husband and Li's relative,
    Our village's good sons are all in the Eighth Route Army,
    The soldiers fight to ensure emancipation;
    We make military shoes not for anyone else.

    Until the moon moves to the treetop, the night grows deeper,
    Until the lamp wick burns and the oil runs out,
    Making those shoes with thick soles and bull noses,
    Thousands of stitches, each stitch tight.

    A pair of military shoes carries a letter:
    -- "Wearing these shoes, remember the people's hearts:
    Spur on your horses and advance,
    With one mighty push, drive away those stubborn troops!"

　　灯下谣
    李株
    窗格格外面月亮一片银，
    窗里静悄悄好象没有人，
    一条麻绳儿一根针，
    一盏油灯儿守到更深。
　
    张家的丈夫李家的亲，
    咱村的好子弟都在八路军，
    子弟兵打仗为保翻身；
    咱做军鞋不为别人。
　
    直到那月移树稍更儿深，
    直到那稔子点完油耗尽，
    做成那毛毛底底牛鼻鼻，
    千针万针，针针儿紧。
　
    一只军鞋捎带一道信：
    ——“穿上这鞋来记起人民心：
    快马加鞭往前提，
    一股劲打走那顽固军！”
