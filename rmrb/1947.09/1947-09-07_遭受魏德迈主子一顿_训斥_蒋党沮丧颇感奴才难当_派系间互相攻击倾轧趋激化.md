Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 5th—According to various sources: In the week since Wedemeyer's departure statement, the "defeatist" mood in Nanjing's petty court, which Wedemeyer called "discouraged" and "despicable," has apparently increased. Nanjing's lackeys, who are meticulously busy decorating their "showcase" as ordered, feel that being a lackey is not easy. Therefore, amid the Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous clique's noisy defenses, there are tones of resentment towards their master, and the factional infighting has turned into a chaotic mess.

One reaction concerns the issue of face. "'The senators [of the Kuomintang] said: Wedemeyer violated international etiquette by criticizing China too frankly and openly. Some senators believe that it is not necessary to mention anti-corruption, because this is a well-known matter.' (United Press, 28th)" It is said that Chiang himself also felt humiliated. On the morning of the 29th, "Chiang Kai-shek gave a speech to the 'State Council,' reportedly calling Truman's special envoy Wedemeyer's departure statement an insult." (Agence France-Presse, Nanjing) The meeting caused an uproar and debate. Zeng Qi of the political beggar Youth Party then joked: "Wedemeyer's criticism does not necessarily represent the views of the U.S. government," which "was agreed to by the majority of the 'State Council members' present." (Ibid.)

Another reaction is: disagreement with the U.S. attributing the responsibility for Chiang Kai-shek's crisis to the Chiang government itself, even pushing the responsibility back to the American superiors. According to the Associated Press, Nanjing, 28th, after Wedemeyer attended Chiang's "State Council" meeting for a lecture on the 21st, Chiang's Foreign Minister submitted a letter to Wei on the 24th, "expressing disagreement with Wedemeyer's suggestion that the expansion of the Communist forces was largely due to the corrupt central [referring to Chiang] government." The Associated Press also stated: When Chiang's Executive Yuan met on the 28th, several officials condemned "the United States for repeatedly making mistakes during and after the war," causing China [referring to Chiang Kai-shek's rule] to fall into a "tragic situation." One minister at the meeting said: "We admit that the National Government is corrupt and incompetent, as Wedemeyer pointed out, but we ask the United States to reflect on its own mistakes."

The "strict and far-reaching political reforms" mentioned in Wedemeyer's statement, "especially the reform of provincial and county institutions," on the one hand, means improving the "efficiency" of Chiang Kai-shek's anti-people civil war government, but more importantly, it means the complete enslavement of the Chiang Kai-shek government. This requires cleansing those who occupy Chiang's party and government organs, especially the provincial and county party and government organs, who are called "ignorant, incompetent, and infamous" by Wedemeyer, the CC clique and Chiang Kai-shek's other old partners, and replacing them with people who please the United States, so that the Chiang government is not only in fact but also formally a 100% traitorous puppet government. Chiang Kai-shek, in order to avoid complete collapse, even if he finally has to agree, is obviously still hesitant at present, because this will weaken Chiang Kai-shek's absolute power, and at the same time, the CC clique, the pillar of absolute power, is even more unwilling to be forced to give up public positions and go behind the scenes. On this point, the CC clique has issued strong complaints against its American masters. When Chen Lifu gave a speech in Nanjing on the 1st of this month, he was obviously complaining that the Americans did not know what was good for them. He took credit for his group, that is, the right-wing group or die-hards referred to by the American press, and belittled the value of the so-called "liberal" Political Science Clique. He gave a "definition": "Those who are aware of the Communist Party's 'conspiracy' [referring to the CCP's struggle for the independence and democracy of the motherland] are called die-hards; those who are aware of the Communist Party's 'conspiracy' later are called liberals; those who are unaware of the Communist Party's 'conspiracy' are called the Democratic League." Sour grapes, Chen Lifu pointed at others, scolding the "pathetic" and "shameless reliance mentality," and saying that "the recovery of national self-esteem and self-confidence is really related to the success or failure of the "revolution" [counter-revolution]." In fact, the national scum CC's issuance of this kind of argument is just a conspiracy. According to a report from Shanghai by New York Herald Tribune reporter Rand on the 29th, "The attacks on Wedemeyer's statement by the Shen Bao [CC] and the Shishi Xinbao [Kong family] may be a trick to show the United States what the consequences would be if Wedemeyer did not recommend rich aid to Chiang Kai-shek." In addition, Wu Tiecheng, vice president of Chiang's Legislative Yuan, published a special article in the Nanjing Central Daily on the 29th, defending the current political institutions of the government, believing that "the transition from a general, old-fashioned, and scattered political form to a modern [Americanized] and organized country cannot be achieved overnight." He also said: "The Chinese people [referring to the Chinese reactionaries] must choose a government that is in line with the foundation of China and progressive, and President Chiang's government is in line with this tone in any case." But even this Wu Tiecheng did not believe his own words, and therefore went on to say: "Naturally, we do not admit that the people are not satisfied with all the measures of the government, this is not to overthrow it."

The "economic reforms" and "eradication of corruption" mentioned in Wedemeyer's statement also aroused various defenses in Nanjing and intensified the infighting among the factions within Chiang Kai-shek's reactionaries. Wu Tiecheng stated in his article that privileged families cannot give up the right to money, writing: "As for foreign trade, due to the instability of the post-war economic order, stricter controls must be adopted." Fu Sinian, a CC retainer who opposed Kong and Song, said: "Only a small part (?) of Nanjing officials are corrupt, but among this small part, the leading figures in China's financial economy are an important component" [Associated Press, New York, 30th]. Chen Cheng also dragged down the Political Science Clique, strongly stating: "The [Chiang] government is determined to eliminate corruption," and he will "make a start in the Northeast." And Kong Xiangxi's Shishi Xinbao only emphasized that the rotten sore is that I have it and you also have it: "It declared that Wedemeyer failed to consider the decline of moral standards around the world after the war—in France, Britain, and even the United States, and cited the criminal incidents of many U.S. Army and Navy personnel, including those in China, as examples." (United Press, Shanghai, 26th)

But what to do after depression, resentment, and even crying? Chiang Kai-shek cannot survive a day without a large amount of blood transfusion from the United States. On the American side, "no matter how stinging Wedemeyer's 'hard talk' about the 'Central' [Chiang government]'s corruption and incompetence" is, "the cold fact is that the United States has to deal with the Chiang Kai-shek government" (New York Times, 30th). Hitting is pain, scolding is love, traitor Tao Xisheng said in Hangzhou one day that the Chiang government "will deeply reflect." Wu Tiecheng said: The Chiang government has listed "eliminating feudalism, corruption, and bureaucratic capitalism" and "improving administrative efficiency" as "current revolutionary tasks." According to the Associated Press, the upcoming Fourth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang will also thoroughly "digest" Wedemeyer's statement, and it is expected that there will be another comedy performance of "reorganizing" the government. In any case, Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary group cannot and dare not refuse all the requirements of its master; therefore, they are still confident that the United States will continue to provide assistance, and there may even be more assistance. Chiang's deputy propaganda minister, the traitor Tao Xisheng, made a self-confession of a lackey in a tragic tone in his speech. He implied that the collapse of Chiang Kai-shek's rule was also the collapse of the United States' imperialist rule over China. He repeated Chiang Kai-shek's secret training to his senior cadres: "I personally believe that in the end, China [referring to Chiang] and the United States must be tied together." His voice was mournful, fully showing the tragic situation of Chiang's petty court today! Chiang's unprecedentedly critical military, political, and economic crisis has forced its reactionary authorities to rely unconditionally on its master and to put their bets on the slim chance of "the end."

　　遭受魏德迈主子一顿“训斥”
  　蒋党沮丧颇感奴才难当
    派系间互相攻击倾轧趋激化
    【新华社陕北五日电】综合各方消息：魏德迈离华声明发表后一旬以来，南京小朝廷中被魏德称为“丧气”、“可鄙”的“失败主义”的情绪，显已增涨。南京的奴才们在奉命唯谨忙碌地装饰其“橱窗”的工作中，颇有当奴才不易之感。因而在蒋介石卖国集团一片哓哓辩解声中，夹杂着怨怼主人的口吻，与派别间的哄然倾轧，乱成一片。
    一种反应是关于面子问题的。“（国民党的）参政员们说：魏德迈违背了国际礼仪，批评中国太坦率，太公开了。有些参政员认为不需要提反贪污，因为这乃是众所周知的事情。”（合众社二十八日电）据说蒋自己也觉得丢脸，廿九日晨“蒋介石向‘国务会议’发表演讲，据说他将杜鲁门特使魏德迈的离华声明称之为一种侮辱。”（法新闻社南京电）会上并引起哗然辩论。政治乞丐青年党曾琦当时解嘲说：“魏德迈的批评，并不一定代表美国政府的意见，”结果“获得与会大多数‘国府委员’的同意。”（同上）
    另一种反应是：对美国把蒋介石危机责任归诸蒋政府自身一点表示不服，甚至反过来把这责任推给美国上司。据美联社南京二十八日电，当二十一日魏德迈出席蒋家“国务会议”训话后，蒋政府外交部长二十四日曾以函件递交魏，“对魏德迈所暗示中共势力的扩张，大半是由于腐朽的中央（指蒋）政府一节，表示不服。”美联社又称：蒋记行政院二十八日开会时，若干要员谴责“美国在战时和战后屡犯错误，”致使中国（指蒋介石统治）陷于“悲惨境地”。会上一个部长曾说：“我们承认如同魏德迈所指出的一样，国民政府是腐败无能，但是我们要求美国也稍微反省一下自己的错误。”
    魏德迈声明中所论“严厉而远大之政治改革”，“尤其省县机构的改革”，一方面固然意味着提高蒋介石反人民内战政府的“效率”，但更主要的是意味着蒋介石政府的彻底奴化。这就需要清洗那些盘据蒋记党政机关，特别是省县党政机关，被魏德迈称为“颟顸无能而又声名狼藉”的ＣＣ派以及蒋介石的其他老搭裆，而代之以美国高兴的人物，使蒋政府不但在实际上而且在形式上也是百分之百的卖国的傀儡政府。此点，蒋介石为着不致完全坍台即使终于不得不同意，显然在目前还有所踌躇，因为这将要削弱蒋介石的绝对权力，同时绝对权力支柱的ＣＣ派，更不愿被迫放弃公开职位，转入幕后活动。在这点上，ＣＣ派对其美国主人发出了强烈的怨愤之声。本月一日陈立夫在南京发表谈话时，显然在埋怨美国人不识货，他给自己一伙，即美国报界所称的右翼集团或顽固分子的表功，而贬低所谓“自由主义分子”政学系的身价，他下“定义”说：“对于共党之‘阴谋’（按指中共为祖国之独立与民主奋斗）为先知觉者曰顽固分子；对于共党之‘阴谋’为后知后觉者曰自由分子；对于共党之‘阴谋’为不知不觉者曰民主同盟”。吃不到的葡萄是酸的，于是陈立夫指着别人，大骂“可悲”的“无耻的倚赖心理”，并说什么“民族自尊心自信力之恢复，实有关“革命”（按反革命）之成败了。事实上，民族败类ＣＣ发出此种论调，只是一种阴谋。据纽约先驱论坛报记者兰德二十九日自上海报导称：“申报（按：ＣＣ）和时事新报（按：孔系）两报对魏德迈声明的攻击，可能是一种向美国表示，如果魏德迈不建议予蒋介石以丰富的援助，那就会有什么后果的诡计。”此外，蒋记立法院副院长吴铁城，二十九日发表在南京中央日报的专论，则为目前各政府之政治机构作辩护，认为“由一般古旧的、散漫的政治形态，进为现代化（按即美国化）有组织的国家，当不能一蹴而成”。又说：“中国人民（指中国反动派）必须抉择一个合于中国基础的而又进步的政府，而蒋主席的政府无论如何是合乎这个基调的。”可是就是这个吴铁城，也不相信他自己的话，因而紧接着说：“自然，我们不承认人民并不对政府的一切措施满意，这并不就是要推翻他。”
    魏德迈声明中所谓的“经济改革”和“肃清贪污”，也引起了南京种种辩解，并使蒋介石反动派内部各派间之倾轧趋于激化。吴铁城在他的论文中表示特权家族不能放弃金钱的权利，写道：“至若对外贸易，因战后经济秩序之未臻稳定，必待采取较严格的管制。”反孔宋的ＣＣ食客的傅斯年说：“南京官员中，只有一小部分（？）腐败，但这一小部分中，中国财政经济的领导人物是一个重要成份”【美联社纽约三十日电】。陈诚也拖住政学系，力称：“（蒋）政府决心清除贪污”，他将在“东北作一个开始”。而孔祥熙的时事新报，则只有强调烂疮我有你也有：“宣称魏德迈未能考虑到战后全世界道德标准的衰落——在法国、英国甚至美国，并引美国包括在华的许多海陆军人员的犯罪事件为例”。（合众社上海二十六日电）
    但是，沮丧、怨愤以至哭泣之后又怎样办呢？蒋介石一天没有美国的大量输血，就一天也活不下去。而美国方面，“不论魏德迈对‘中央’（蒋政府）的腐败无能”所作的“强硬谈话”如何刺人，无情的事实是美国不得不与蒋介石政府打交道”（三十日纽约时报讯）。打是疼，骂是爱，汉奸陶希圣一日在杭州就说，蒋政府“将要痛切反省。”吴铁城说：蒋政府已把“肃清封建、贪污、官僚资本”，“提高行政效率”，列入“当前的革命任务”了。据美联社说，最近就要召开的国民党四中全会，也将彻底“消化”魏德迈的声明，预期还会再有“改组”政府的喜剧演出。无论如何，蒋介石反动集团对其主子的一切要求，是不能也不敢不接受的；也就因此，他们仍然自信美国总要继续援助，甚至还可能有更大量的援助。蒋党副宣传部长汉奸陶希圣，在谈话中就以悲惨的语调作了奴才的自白，他暗示蒋介石统治的垮台，也就是美国对中国帝国主义统治的垮台。他重复蒋介石对其高级干部秘密的训话说：“我个人相信，中（指蒋）美两国到了最后，必须结在一起”。其声哀哀，充分显出蒋家小朝廷今日处境的悲惨！蒋家空前危急的军事、政治、经济危机，已迫得其反动当局只能无条件地依靠他的主子，和只好将赌注放在渺茫的“最后”上面去了。
