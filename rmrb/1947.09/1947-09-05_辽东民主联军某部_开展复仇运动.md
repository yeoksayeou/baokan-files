Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 3rd: A certain unit of the Liaodong Democratic Allied Army, combining grievance airing with killing enemies and making meritorious contributions, has greatly enhanced the soldiers' level of awareness and enthusiasm for killing the enemy. Before the summer offensive, the unit held a general celebration meeting to commend heroes and at the same time carried out in-depth grievance airing, self-criticism, and a revenge-and-merit campaign. At the beginning of the grievance airing campaign, the unit first used the reports of Fang Tianjing, a soldier from the Ninth Company with the deepest suffering and high political awareness, and Ren Jizhen, the platoon leader of the third platoon of the machine gun company, as examples. Then, they held group discussions to guide everyone to pour out their grievances, and then organized grievance airing meetings in units of companies. One soldier from the Ninth Company said emotionally at the grievance airing meeting: "My mother is still suffering in the KMT-controlled area, and I will fight desperately to avenge her." At that time, the entire audience immediately shouted the slogan: "Your mother is my mother, avenge the mothers who are suffering in the KMT-controlled area." Afterwards, the movement turned to ideological examination. In addition to the general soldiers showing increased hatred and eagerness to make meritorious contributions, some were very silent, overestimated the reactionary forces, were pessimistic and disappointed, and a few who had done bad things in the past were panicked and afraid, with heavy ideological burdens. The unit immediately focused on explaining and comforting the activists individually to relieve them of their ideological concerns, and further guided them to dig up the roots of suffering,展开以“苦从何处来”为题展开讨论,使大家认识到地主、恶霸、汉奸、警察等所给予广大人民的苦痛，总根源是蒋介石统治，从而加深了对蒋介石血腥统治的认识。 The discussion unfolded under the title of "Where Does Suffering Come From?", so that everyone realized that the suffering inflicted on the broad masses of people by landlords, local bullies, traitors, and police was rooted in Chiang Kai-shek's rule, thereby deepening their understanding of Chiang Kai-shek's bloody rule. After airing grievances and digging up roots, the stage of confession began, and it was announced that in order to keep certain secrets, one could directly confess to the branch under certain circumstances. Individual talks were also conducted to provide comfort and encouragement, and others were asked to have a correct understanding and attitude towards those who confessed. After the confession, the unit checked for ungrateful thoughts and launched a unity campaign. First, the Communist Party's lenient policy was explained to dispel various ideological concerns, such as veteran comrades worrying that after confession, they would not gain the trust of their superiors and would lose prestige in front of the new comrades, and new comrades worrying about being punished and having no future. Then, typical confession reports were made to promote the development of the movement. Those who did not confess thoroughly had intense inner struggles. The leadership had to promptly put forward, according to the specific situation: "Throw away the burden," "Make meritorious service to atone for sins," and "Start a new life" to enable everyone to turn to the revenge movement and integrate it with the current tasks. After the entire movement, the unit's morale was extremely high. Then, a revenge meeting was held at the regimental level. First, condolences were offered to the parents, brothers, sisters, and compatriots who were enslaved to death by landlords, local bullies, and Chiang Kai-shek. The root causes of suffering were summarized, and methods for revenge were discussed, and plans for revenge and meritorious service were formulated. Finally, oaths were taken, and the unit immediately turned to practical actions of revenge and meritorious service. After this education and transformation, the unit's morale and combat effectiveness were unprecedentedly improved, the internal unity was more consolidated, and the defeat of the enemy's New Sixth Army's 22nd Division and other major victories during the summer offensive were guaranteed.

　　辽东民主联军某部
  　开展复仇运动
    【新华社东北三日电】辽东民主联军某部以诉苦运动与杀敌立功等结合，大大提高了战士们的觉悟程度与杀敌热情。该部于夏季攻势前，普遍召开庆功大会表扬功臣，同时进行深入的诉苦，坦白和复仇立功运动。诉苦运动开始时该部首先以受苦最深政治觉悟较高的九连战士房天静及机枪连三排排长任纪贞作典的报告，然后分组交谈，引导大家倒苦水之后再以连为单位组织诉苦大会。九连一个战士在诉苦大会上感动的说：“我母亲还在蒋管区受罪，我要拚命为她复仇。”当时全场立即喊起：“你的母亲就是我的母亲，为在蒋管区受罪的母亲们复仇”的口号。以后转入思想检查，除一般战士表现仇恨上升，急于要求立功外，有些表现很沉默，对反动势力估计过高，悲观失望，个别过去做过坏事的恐慌害怕，思想上包袱很重。该部即抓紧积极分子个别进行解说和慰劝，使其免除思想上的顾虑，更进而导入挖苦根，以“苦从何处来”为题展开讨论，使大家认识到地主、恶霸、汉奸、警察等所给予广大人民的苦痛，总根源是蒋介石统治，从而加深了对蒋介石血腥统治的认识。诉苦挖根之后进入坦白阶段，并宣布为了保守某些秘密在一定情况下可以找支部直接坦白，同时进行个别谈话，予以安慰鼓励，并要其他的人对坦白者要有正确的认识和态度。坦白之后，即检查忘本思想与展开一条心运动，首先解说共产党的宽大政策，打破各种思想顾○，如老同志顾虑坦白后，得不到上级的信任，在新同志面前丧失威信，新同志顾虑受处分，没有前途。然后作典型坦白报告，以推动运动开展。坦白不彻底者内心斗争激烈，领导上须及时按具体情况提出：“抛掉包袱”，“立功赎罪”，“从新做人”使大家转入复仇运动，并使之与当前任务结合起来。该部在整个运动结束后，情绪极为激昂，于是又以团为单位召开复仇大会，首先向被地主恶霸和蒋介石奴役而死的父母兄弟姊妹同胞们致哀悼，总结受苦根源，并商讨复仇办法，拟定复仇和立功计划，最后并举行宣誓，立即转入复仇立功的实际行动。该部经此次教育和改造，士气和战斗力空前提高，内部更加巩固团结，并保证了夏季攻势中击溃敌新六军廿二师及其他重大胜利。
