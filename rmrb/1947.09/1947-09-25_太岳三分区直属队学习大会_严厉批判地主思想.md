    Taiyue Third Subdistrict Directly Subordinate Team Study Conference
    Severely Criticizing Landlord Ideology
    [This newspaper's dispatch from the 22nd] Cadres of the Third Subdistrict's directly subordinate teams, deeply studying land reform, have severely criticized landlord ideology. The Subdistrict’s land reform study entered the stage of general discussion on August 29th. Initially, some comrades spoke, mostly limited to the so-called shortcomings and biases of cadres present, such as believing that the Party's policies were correct, and uniting 90 percent of the peasants was also correct, but some peasant association cadres were not good and messed up the work. Section Chief Zhang, who had returned to Beizhao Village in Quwo County to try to prevent the masses from struggling against his own landlord family but failed, openly opposed land reform at the meeting, saying: "The land reform policy is right, and the masses struggling against my family is also right, but the peasant association cadre Wang Zhigao is all-powerful and blocks all avenues of appeal. It's all his fault. He forced the masses to beat my father three times." Speaking here, he seemed to cry sadly. He also said: "Last time, some 'masses' jointly accused Wang Zhigao, but he did not examine himself, but instead said it was sabotage by special agents." Finally, he emphasized: "My family started from scratch in Quwo, earning our living through labor, but Wang Zhigao classified my family as an 'exploiting landlord' and struggled against us four or five times. The 'masses' unanimously believed it was thorough, but this time when I went back, they were brewing another struggle. My father handed over ingots and silver worth over 20 million yuan, but it was still not enough. Now my whole family has been swept out of the house." Zhang ××’s speech temporarily deceived most of the comrades into sympathizing with him, and some comrades even proposed that "peasant association cadres should all be investigated." However, Comrade Li Zhonghe immediately raised the question: "Your family started from scratch in Quwo, earning your living through labor. How could you have so many ingots and silver without exploiting the poor? Can it be said that your class status was wrongly determined if you have ingots and silver?" After the meeting, the Study Committee immediately convened a meeting to study the matter, pointing out that this was a typical example of landlord ideology, a defense of landlords' clamoring, and needed to be discussed. After group discussions, the atmosphere at the meeting on the fourth day was unprecedentedly enthusiastic, and landlord ideology was severely criticized. Some comrades said: "Concentrating opposition to land reform on peasant association cadres is a common tactic of landlords. The joint accusation against Wang Zhigao is a counter-offensive conspiracy by landlords." Several comrades from working-class families said: "My family has been working for generations, but we have never prospered, and we have never even seen ingots!" Several comrades who knew Zhang ××'s family said: "His eldest brother is a division commander in the Central Army, and his third brother is a speculation ringleader, but he doesn't mention these facts; just his wife has 5,000 silver dollars in her hands, one can imagine the condition of his family." At this point, the thinking of some comrades who sympathized with Zhang ×× also turned around, realizing that they had been blinded by landlord ideology, and began to deeply examine their own thinking.

    太岳三分区直属队学习大会
    严厉批判地主思想
    【本报二十二日电】三分区直属队干部，深入土改学习，地主思想受到严厉批判。分直土改学习于八月二十九日转入大会讨论，开始有些同志发言，多限于所谓到会干部的缺点与偏向，如认为党的政策是对的，团结百分之九十的农民也是正确的，就是有些农会干部不好，把工作搞坏了。曾回到曲沃北赵村企图阻止群众斗争自己地主家庭未达目的的张科长，公开在大会上反对土改说：“土改政策倒对，群众斗争我家也对，就是农会干部王志高一手遮天，斗争封门，都是他的事，三次强迫群众打我父亲。”说到这里，他似乎伤心的哭了。又说：“上次曾有‘群众’联名控告过王志高，他不检讨，反说是特务捣乱。”最后他特别强调的说：“我家是一担子挑到曲沃，劳动起家的，而王志高却把我家划成经营地主，斗争四五次了，‘群众’一致认为彻底了，这次我回去，又酝酿斗争，我父亲交出元宝与白洋价值两千多万元，还不行，现在已将我全家扫地出门。”张××这一发言，一时欺骗的大部份同志同情，有些同志竟提出“农会干部都需要审查”。但是李中和同志马上提出了质问：“你家是一担子挑到曲沃劳动起家的，不剥削穷人怎么会有这样多的元宝和白银？有元宝和白银能说是错划了成份吗？”会后，学委会立即召开会议研究，指出这是地主思想的典型，是为地主叫嚣辩护，需要展开讨论。经过小组酝酿后，第四天会上，发言空前热烈，对地主思想给了严厉的批判。有的同志说：“将反对土改集中到农会干部身上，这是一般地主的手法，联名控告王志高，是地主的反攻阴谋。”几个出身于劳动家庭的同志则说：“我家几辈子劳动，都没有发了家，更没有见过元宝！”有几个了解张××家庭的同志说：“他大哥在中央军当师长，三哥是倒算头子，他却不提这些事实；光他的女人手中就有白洋五千元，可想其家庭状况。”至此，同情张××的一部份同志，思想亦扭转过来，知道自己是被地主思想所蒙蔽，开始深入检查自己思想。
