    Choping 50,000 Catties of Firewood to Set Up Large Fire Platforms
    Dongguan, Xiyang, Protects Against Frost
    [Our Newspaper, Xiyang News] Dongguan Street, Area 1, Xiyang, studied frost prevention work, established a Frost Prevention Wheat Planting Autumn Harvest Committee, and divided the area into four frost prevention zones. A mass meeting was held to mobilize the people. During the discussion, Miao Peiyun said: "I used to grow vegetables in a garden, and when I lit a fire on the Longgou (ditch) in the middle of the night, the vegetable garden was not frosted." Zhao Yongyi said: "That year, I watched sheep in the field at night and burned a pile of fire. It happened to be a frosty night, and there was no frost near the fire." After discussion, more than 650 men and women in the whole street were mobilized on the spot to form three teams and twenty-four groups. According to the frost prevention zones, they all went out to launch a vigorous firewood chopping campaign. Statistics showed that more than 50,000 catties of firewood were chopped in half a day. Each frost prevention zone set up 96 fire platforms, and fire piles were organized at night. When frost fell, the main station issued a signal, and each fire platform immediately ignited.

    [Our Newspaper, Taihang News] On September 19th, promoters from the Second Special District Agricultural and Forestry Bureau went to Yuci, Wu'an, Xiangyuan, Zuoquan, Heshun, and Xiyang counties to help with autumn harvesting and wheat planting work. The key points: (1) Organize frost prevention. The climate in the Second District is relatively cool, and wind and frost have been serious in recent years, especially this year, when there are many late-maturing crops. In order to protect crop harvests, people were specially organized in each county to prevent frost. (2) Carry out field seed selection, organize the masses to select wind-resistant, insect-resistant, and other fine varieties in the fields for seed. (3) Help with wheat planting and provide technical guidance. (Kaiji, Changting, Shouhe)

    【本报昔阳讯】昔阳一区东关街，研究防霜工作，成立了防霜种麦秋收委员会，并划分了四个防霜区，并召开群众会动员。在讨论中苗培云说：“我从前种菜园，在龙沟上（水沟）半夜点火，菜园便没有下霜。”赵永义说：“那年我夜里在地里看羊，烧了一堆火，正遇夜间落霜，在烧火的附近，一点寒霜也未落下。”后经讨论，当场便动员了全街男女群众六百五十余人，组织了三分队，二十四小组，按照防霜区，全体出动，展开了轰轰烈烈的砍柴运动。统计半日共砍柴五万余斤，各防霜区共设堆火台九十六个，并在夜间组织了点火堆，到下霜时，总台发号，各个火台立即发火。（兴晋、德甫、新福）
