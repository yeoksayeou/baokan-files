Xinhua News Agency, Jicha-Rehe-Liao, 11th — The Jidong and Jire-Cha guerrilla warfare, combined with the revenge, land reform movement, has expanded from the central areas to the peripheral guerrilla zones. Chiang's troops once concentrated their forces in Changli, Beidaihe, and Qinhuangdao to carry out frantic "sweeps" against the edge areas of Funing, attempting to undermine the people's liberation. Reactionary landlords and local bullies also took the opportunity to spread rumors and harm farmers. The broad masses of people resolutely launched a counter-encroachment struggle in coordination with the work teams under the slogan of "One person harmed, ten thousand avenge." The county's armed review brigade also used armed forces to support the farmers' struggle, and the flying squad broke through the blockade line to raid the Binhai Station of the Beining Railway, destroying the enemy's police station. They combined mass explosions and united village encirclements to strike at the enemy. Villages that could operate during the day cooperated with the armed forces at night to carry out joint village struggles. If land reform could not be carried out in their own village, the landlords were taken outside the village for land reform. Now, the peasants' revenge and land reform movement has extended to a certain village on the outskirts of Changli, about twenty li from Andingmen in Beiping, surrounded by strongholds of the Chiang and puppet regimes. Farmers have also automatically launched a land reform struggle, detaining all twelve local tyrant landlords in the village. Within four days, the number of activists expanded from more than twenty to more than one hundred and thirty. All the detained landlords were escorted to the Wenyu River (a tributary of Beidaihe) to the guerrilla base area in the east to hold a grievance and liquidation conference. A large number of people participated temporarily. More than one hundred and seventy people spoke out about their grievances at the meeting. Under the power of the masses, the local tyrant landlords were all dejected and lost their prestige. A total of 1,757 mu of land and more than 1,200 shi of grain were liquidated. Under the slogan of defending the fruits of struggle, eleven young farmers immediately volunteered to join the army. Fifteen male and female work exchange teams of one hundred and five people were immediately established in the village, rushing to hoe the newly distributed land day and night. Influenced by this village, a fierce land reform struggle has been launched in the surrounding villages.

    【新华社冀察热辽十一日电】冀东及冀热察游击战争结合复仇清算土地改革运动，已从中心地区扩展至边沿游击区。蒋军曾集中昌黎、北戴河、秦皇岛兵力向抚宁边沿区疯狂“扫荡”，企图破坏群众翻身，反动地主恶霸亦乘机活动，到处造谣残害农民。广大群众则坚决在“一人被害，万人报仇”的口号下，配合工作队展开敌进我进的反蚕食斗争。该县武装复查大队亦以武装支持农民斗争，飞行组则冲过封锁线突击北宁路滨海站摧毁敌警察所，结合群众性爆炸及联合村包围打击敌人。白天能行动的村子，夜里配合武装进行联村斗争，本村不能进行清算，则把地主带到村外清算，现农民复仇清算运动已伸展至昌黎城郊距北平安定门二十余里为蒋伪据点环绕的边沿某村农民，亦自动掀起清算分田斗争，将该村十二个恶霸地主全部扣押，四天内积极分子，即由二十余人扩大至一百三十余人。并将扣押地主全部解送至温榆河（北戴的支流）东游击根据地举行诉苦清算大会，临时参加的群众极多，会上先后诉苦者共一百七十多人，恶霸地主在群众威力下，个个垂头丧气，威风扫地，共清算出土地一千七百五十七亩，粮食一千二百余石。今后在保卫斗争果实的口号下，立即有十一个青年农民自动报名参军。村中并即成立一百零五人的十五个男女变工小组，连日突击抢锄新分得的土地。在该村的影响下，附近各村已普遍展开了激烈的复仇清算分地斗争。
