Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 5th. The increasingly serious smuggling activities along China's coast are not only organized by Chiang Kai-shek's civil and military officials, but also have American military personnel as their backers, with the two colluding with each other. This has become an undeniable fact. According to a Central News Agency dispatch from Honolulu on the 3rd, a US Navy Fleet spokesman revealed that US Navy officers and customs personnel are traveling between Guam and the Chinese coast engaging in large-scale smuggling. He also stated: "Evidence of smuggled goods of Nigerian origin (American goods) being trafficked by this large-scale smuggling organization has also been discovered in the past few weeks."

　　美军从事走私活动
  　侵害我国主权
    【新华社陕北五日电】中国沿海日益严重的走私活动，不仅为蒋介石的文武大员所组织，而且有美国军人为背景，两者并互相勾结，此已成为无可否认的事实。据中央社檀香山三日电，美海军舰队发言人透露：美海军军官及海关人员正来往于关岛及中国海岸从事大规模走私。并称：“此项大规模走私组织所贩运之尼日制（美国货）走私物品证据，亦已在过去数周中发现。”
