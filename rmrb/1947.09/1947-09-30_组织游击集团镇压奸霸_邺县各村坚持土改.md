    Organizing Guerrilla Groups to Suppress Evil Tyrants
    The Villages of Ye County Persist in Land Reform
    [Reported by this newspaper] The enemy trapped on the isolated island of Anyang is struggling desperately, launching counterattacks against our newly liberated areas of Ye County, looting grain everywhere, conscripting men, destroying land reform, and killing our militiamen and cadres. Initially, the leadership underestimated their frenzy, and suffered considerable losses. After reviewing the situation, we reorganized our forces to resolutely fight back, using guerrilla groups as units to return to the villages and fight alongside the masses. First, we cleared out and captured the black gun thugs, evil tyrants, and those who were trying to reverse the verdicts of class struggle. From August to September, in a month and a half, there were a total of more than 300 battles, large and small, which boosted the morale of the masses. The village self-defense forces were automatically standing guard, checking bad people all night without sleep, and the masses were vying to scout for information. The retired militiamen and district cadres were assigned to various villages to persist in land reform; the fourteen villages in the sixth district have been mobilized. If the enemy doesn't come, we lead the struggle; if the enemy comes, we cover the masses' retreat. Once, when a mass meeting was being held in a village, the enemy came, and the militiamen quickly covered the masses' retreat. Seeing that they were about to be overtaken, the militiamen calmly opened fire, and the joint defense militiamen heard the gunshots and rushed to reinforce them, launching an ambush warfare of cold shots and landmines on all sides, and the enemy was quickly driven back. The villages in the second district, three or four miles away from the enemy, are also persisting in the land reform movement in the same way. The entire fifth district is in a booming and vigorous battle, and even the backward villages in the past have broken through. In Dujiazhuang, after a struggle on the first day, the enemy came to grab the fruits of the struggle the next day. Du Yongchun, the chairman of the farmers' association, rushed out of the encirclement without wearing clothes and asked for joint defense militiamen, who drove the enemy away and retrieved all the stolen goods.

    组织游击集团镇压奸霸
    邺县各村坚持土改
    【本报讯】困在安阳孤岛之敌，临死挣扎，向我邺县新解放区反扑，到处抢粮、抓丁、破坏土地改革，杀我民兵及干将，开始领导上对其疯狂性估计不足，曾受相当损失。经检讨后，整顿力量坚决打回去，以游击集团为单位回村与群众一道坚持斗争，首先对黑枪手奸霸及倒算头子进行了清剿和捕捉，从八月到九月一个半月中，计大小战斗共三百余次，鼓舞了群众的斗志。各村自卫队都是自动站岗，彻夜不睡的检查坏人，群众争相去探情报，退出的民兵与区干部都分到各村去坚持土改；六区十四个村已运动起来了，敌不来就领导斗，敌人来了就掩护群众退却。有一次正在村里开群众大会，敌人来了，民兵赶快掩护群众退却，眼看就要被追上，民兵沉着开枪射击，联防民兵听到都赶来增援，四面展开冷枪地雷战，敌人很快就被打退了。二区离敌三、四里地的村庄，也同样坚持着土改运动。五区全境都在轰轰烈烈的战斗中，连过去的落后村也突开了，杜家庄头天斗争了，第二天敌人就来抢斗争果实，农会主席杜永春，未穿衣服冲出包围，请来联防民兵，将敌打跑，东西全数截回。
