　　Central Bureau Cadres Deeply Examine Thought
  　Land Reform Study Already Unfolded
    [Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] The Central Bureau's land reform study has now unfolded. When the study began on August 15th, the Party branch determined to first reflect on one's own understanding of land reform, examine class standing and thought, and then read documents, in order to avoid starting from the wording or concepts of the documents. The first week of study resulted in most groups merely determining their class status without linking it to thought, with little effect. Some old comrades of landlord origin felt that there was nothing to examine, that they supported land reform very much, but did not identify how their thinking had been transformed. Comrades who had been emancipated peasants said: What is there for us to examine? That is a matter for comrades of landlord origin, feeling that the study had nothing to do with them. Universally, the attitude towards study was not serious enough. In the second week, the Party branch, based on the above situation, corrected the attitude towards study, determining: 1. Each group should cultivate typical examples to enlighten everyone; 2. Discuss specific issues, focusing on the matter, not the person; 3. Write reflective notes. From then on, the study deepened a step further. Each group linked the examination of class and thought, starting with reflecting on specific facts. For example, one comrade, whose family was landlords, felt resentful and wanted revenge when the masses struggled against his tyrannical older brother, and proposed eight major demands to the masses. He reflected on his own position and thought from this matter. The Transportation Section group, all of whom were emancipated peasants, previously thought they had nothing to examine, but upon deeper reflection, many comrades complained about the village cadres, saying that the village cadres did not take good care of them. Some were deeply influenced by landlord thinking, saying that paying rent and interest was proper, and that distributing the fruits of struggle was ill-gotten wealth and unreliable, and so on. Comrades of old rich peasant and middle peasant origin felt that no matter what, struggling against landlords was right, but struggling against themselves was not. Some said: the policy of taking care of rich peasants and middle peasants is a "strategy," and is fake, the actual practice is not like that, expressing doubt about the policy. Some said the policy of taking care of them is real, but the local areas did not follow it, disagreeing with the local work comrades. Some comrades have already reflected and lowered their class status when filling out the form. The study movement is still continuing to deepen.

　　中央局干部深入检查思想
  　土改学习业已展开
    【本报特讯】中央局土地改革学习现已展开。八月十五日开始学习时，支部即确定先反省自己对土地改革的认识，查阶级查思想，然后看文件，以避免从文件条文或概念出发。第一星期学习结果，多数小组只单纯的确定了成份，没和思想连系起来，收效不大，有的地主出身的老同志，感到没有什么，对土地改革很拥护，但没有找出思想如何转变过来。翻身户同志说：咱查个啥？那是地主出身同志的事情，感到学习对他没有关系。普遍在学习态度上不够认真严肃。第二星期，支部根据以上情况，端正了学习态度，确定：一、各小组要培养典型，启发大家；二、讨论具体问题，对事不对人。三、写反省笔记。从此学习深入一步，各组把查阶级查思想连系起来，从反省具体事实突开口，如一个同志，他家是地主，群众斗争了他的恶霸哥哥时，自己忿忿不平，要报复，向群众提出八大条款。他就从这事情反省自己的立场和思想。交通科小组，都是翻身户，过去以为自己没啥，但一深入反省，许多同志，抱怨村干部，说村干部没有好好照顾他。有的受地主思想影响很深，说交租交息是应当的，分斗争果实是不义之财，不可靠等等。旧富农、中农出身的同志，不管如何对斗争地主都应该，就是斗自己不应该，有的说：政策上照顾富农、中农是“策略”，是假的，实际做法不是那样，对政策表示怀疑。有的说政策照顾是真的，就是地方上没有照着那样去做，对地方工作同志不同。有的同志已反省出来，填表时降低了自己成份。现学习运动仍在继续深入。
