    Beiliu Branch's Timely Leadership
    Finish Early Wheat Sowing and Seize the Opportunity to Change Crops
    Neiqiu Xiguan: Reap, Plow, and Sow with the Ripening Crop
    [This newspaper's report from Licheng] The Beiliu Branch, seizing the season and the heat of the movement, with Party member heroes taking the lead, completed the sowing of 824.4 mu of direct-sown wheat in the entire village after nine days of intense effort. Then, on the 15th of this month, a branch meeting was held to study what should be done after the direct-sown wheat was finished. It was unanimously recognized that autumn harvest and preparation for changing to wheat were the most important tasks. The hero Li Choudu led his group to draw up a plan: out of 117.92 mu of autumn land in the whole group, removing the peanut, cotton, wheat stubble, and corn land, 33.72 mu of land could be changed to wheat, and it was planned to change all of it to wheat. According to the direct crop situation, the harvest could begin after the Mid-Autumn Festival. For the first ten days, there was a specific division of labor for labor and animals, donkeys transported fertilizer, cattle pushed millstones, male full laborers repaired the edges of the fields, half laborers transported fertilizer, and women, centered on spinning, helped carry fertilizer and tidy up cotton clothes. It would take eight days to transport all the fertilizer and prepare the land. Li Choudu proposed: "Early is better than late, save seeds and harvest more grain. Changing to wheat must guarantee two plows and one harrowing. Cut one piece of ripe grain and change one piece, harvest one side and change the other side. Male half-laborers and naturally-footed women harvest the grain, male full-laborers carry the grain, animals plow the land, women go to the fields to cut the grain and thresh, and sow in a timely manner. All 33.72 mu of direct seedlings in the whole group must be harvested and changed before the Frost's Descent solar term." After his plan was drawn up, a mass meeting was held on the 16th to announce his plan. Everyone discussed it in teams, overcoming the thinking of Li Feihai, Zhang Bingyin, and others who believed that the shock movement had passed, the direct-sown wheat had all been sown, and the autumn seedlings were still early, so they could relax. Zhang Dongshan said: "Yes! Wheat should be changed early to take advantage of the season. This year the fields are large and I'm afraid of early frost." Li Renhu said: "This year we haven't put much effort into the autumn fields, we should change a lot to wheat to achieve the final increase in production this year." After everyone deliberated and discussed, a plan was drawn up for the final increase in production (the second wheat sowing and autumn harvest) for the whole village this year: 891.07 mu of land in the whole village can be changed to wheat, with specific scientific division of labor using labor and animals, which will take seven days to complete. Each mu must reach 25 loads of fertilizer, and achieve deep plowing and fine cultivation, two plows and one harrowing, and all must be changed before the Frost's Descent solar term. Through such specific scientific division of labor and appropriate use of labor, the whole village transported a total of 548 loads of fertilizer in two days, pressed a total of 375 loads of oil cakes (converted to fertilizer), accumulated 115 loads of wasteland fertilizer, and changed 12.5 mu to wheat. It is now in full swing. (Beiliu Correspondence First Group Pei Yi, Huan Qing, Wen Xiu)
    [This newspaper's report from Licheng] The Baojiajiao Branch in the Second District, in order to make up for the poor harvest and increase production by changing to wheat, first summarized the experience and achievements of completing the main crop, and in addition to general mobilization at the meeting, also convened a forum of newly turned-over poor and hired farmers to study expanding wheat fields and increasing production. At the meeting, labor hero Gao Pancao said: "We should weed the grass, hoe the ground, pile up the soil, and plant wheat in the cornfields to expand the wheat fields and increase production to make up for the poor harvest." After his speech, the entire venue discussed and came up with a method: according to the level of technology and the strength of labor, scientific division of labor, early yellowing and early harvest, cutting one piece of ripe grain and sowing one piece, starting early and working late, going all out. Men carry night soil to make fertilizer, women get up early to cook and feed the livestock, and half-skilled people weed and harvest. After the meeting, under the leadership of Gao Pancao, action began. Liu Jinzhuang and other six households began sowing 12 mu in one day. In addition to the 752.7 mu of main crop wheat in the entire village, it is necessary to expand the wheat fields by 400 mu. Changing the crops should account for half of the total land. Now every household is busy rushing to harvest and rush to sow. (Bu Yuan, Gen Sheng, Gen Tang, Zhao Xi)
    [This newspaper's report] The Neiqiu Xiguan Production Committee recently held a preparatory meeting for the autumn harvest to study how to harvest the autumn crop well and sow the wheat well, so as to ensure that every grain of the crop is brought home, sow wheat early and sow more, and also plow deep and fertilize adequately. This is an urgent matter. After specific calculations, the whole village needs to sow 962 mu of wheat and brake 197 mu of dry land. In order to increase the wheat harvest, the dry land will be plowed three times and the stubble land will be plowed twice. In this way, each of the 41 livestock in the village will have to plow an average of 23 mu of land (equivalent to plowing 51 mu), plus hauling crops, threshing, and hauling manure, and the autumn ripening crops, I am afraid that the autumn harvest and autumn sowing time will be prolonged, delaying the work. According to the specific situation in this village, it was decided to reap as it ripens, cultivate as it is vacated, and sow as it is cultivated, hauling manure while hauling crops, and supplementing the lack of animal power with human power, accepting the experience of rushing to sow grain, and organizing people to pull seed drills. The Third, Fourth, and Ninth Groups have already taken action, harvesting 45 mu of ripe crops in five days, and have all sent manure to the fields, and have plowed the first plow. (Mass Newspaper)

    北流支部及时领导
    早麦种完抓紧改茬
    内邱西关趁垧随熟随收随耕随种
    【本报黎城讯】北流支部抓住季节与运动的热气，党员英雄带头，经九天的突击，将全村八百二十四亩四分直麦种完。接着于本月十五日召开支部会，研究种完直麦应该做啥？一致认识秋收改麦准备工作最要紧。英雄李丑犊领导本组订出计划：全组秋地一百一十七亩九分二，除去花生棉花麦茬玉茭等地外，能改麦的地三十三亩七分二，计划全部改麦，根据直庄稼情形，过了中秋节可开镰，前十天劳畜具体分工，驴运肥牛推碾磨，男全劳力修边堰，半劳力运肥，妇女以纺织为中心，帮助抬驮装肥整理棉衣，共需八天运完肥修成地。李丑犊提出：赶早不赶晚，省籽多打粮，改麦要保证犁二犁耙一耙，黄一块割一块，一面割一面改，男半劳力和天足妇女割谷，男全劳力担谷，畜力耕地，妇女到地切谷打场，及时下种，全组三十三亩七分二直苗，在霜降节前收完改完。他的计划订出后，十六日召开群众大会，宣布了他的计划，大家分队讨论，克服了李肥亥、张丙寅等认为突击运动已过，直麦全部种完啦，秋苗还早哩，这可松一口气的思想。张东善说：“只是呀！麦要改早趁节令，今年垧大怕早冻”，李仁虎说：“今年秋地没有出了力，咱们应该大量来改麦，达到今年最后的增产。”经大家酝酿讨论后，订出全村今年最后增产（第二个种麦收秋）计划：全村能改麦的八百九十一亩零七分，具体使用劳畜力科学分工，共需七天完成，每亩要达到二十五驮肥，做到深耕细作，耕两犁，耙一耙，在霜降节全都改完。经过这样具体科学分工，适当使用劳力，全村在两天内共运肥五百四十八驮，共压油饼折肥三百七十五驮，积荒肥一百一十五驮，改麦十二亩半，现正热烈进行中。（北流通讯第一组培义、浣清、文秀）
    【本报黎城讯】二区暴家脚支部，为了补足歉收改麦多增产，首先总结完成正茬经验与成绩，除在会上一般动员外，又召集新翻身贫雇农民座谈，研究扩大麦田增产。在会议上劳动英雄高泮曹说：“咱要去草锄地把土堆，玉茭地里把麦栽，扩大麦田增产补歉收。”经过他的发言，全场讨论出办法是：按技术好坏劳力强弱，科学分工，早黄早收，黄一块割一块，收一块种一块，起早搭黑，全力进行，男人担圊做圪道，妇女起早做饭喂牲口，半把式除草收割。会后又在高泮曹的带头下开始行动，刘金桩等六户开始一天就种了十二亩，全村除七五二点七亩正茬麦外，要扩大麦田四百亩，正改茬要占全地一半，现家家户户正忙着抢收抢种。（步远、根胜、根堂、兆喜）
    【本报讯】内邱西关生产委员会，最近召开了个秋收准备会议，研究今年秋要收好、麦要种好，作到庄稼粒粒收到家，早种多种麦子，还要犁深粪饱，这是个紧迫的事。具体计算了下，全村要种麦子九百六十二亩，刹旱地一百九十七亩，为了增加麦的收成，把刹旱地耕三遍，带茬地耕二遍，这样全村四十一个畜力平均每个畜力要耕地二十三亩（顶耕五十一亩），再加上拉庄稼、碾场、拉粪，和秋熟的不一道，恐怕要拉长秋收秋种的时间，耽误了垧。根据本村这个具体情况，决定随熟随割，随腾随耕，随耕随种，拉庄稼捎拉粪，畜力不足人力补，接受抢种谷时的经验，组织人拉耧。三、四、九组已经行动起来，五天割了熟庄稼四十五亩，并都把粪送到地里，耕过了头犁。（大众报）
