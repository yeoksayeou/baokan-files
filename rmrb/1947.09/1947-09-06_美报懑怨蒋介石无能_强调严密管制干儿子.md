Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 4th. A cable sent on the 2nd of this month by the Central News Agency's New York correspondent to its Nanjing headquarters summarized the American newspapers' comments on Wedemeyer's statement after leaving China over the past week. The cable exposed the general dissatisfaction of various factions of the American bourgeoisie press with Chiang Kai-shek's rule, and acknowledged the severity of his crisis. At the same time, all pointed out that if the United States did not insist on a "thorough overhaul" of the Chiang government, no amount of American aid could save Chiang Kai-shek. Therefore, the newspapers emphasized the need to strengthen the "control" of Chiang Kai-shek, that is, to further enslave Chiang Kai-shek, otherwise "the hope of defeating the Communists will dim day by day." The Central News Agency stated: "The American newspapers, and comments from all quarters, give a strong impression: the opinion of the press—which differs from the views of American officials—regarding China (referring to the Chiang government) has not changed significantly. If anything, not only the Communist and pro-Communist newspapers, but even American editors holding various different political views are even more convinced that the United States should not continue to aid China (Chiang Kai-shek) until the Central (Chiang) government has truly and thoroughly ‘cleaned up’." Here, the American bourgeois press's so-called "true and thorough cleanup" of the Chiang government is obviously a demand to eliminate "corrupt" and "muddleheaded and incompetent" elements to make it an efficient anti-people civil war government, and a 100% Americanized puppet regime. The Central News Agency continued: "The past efforts of Nanjing to 'reorganize' the government and implement 'reforms' have been regarded by many editors as window dressing. Some newspapers, especially the Cleveland Plain Dealer—whose editor recently visited Nanjing—even called Nanjing's recent 'reorganization' 'deceptive.' Suspicion remains about what American editors consider to be reforms on paper, and an even more annoying (!) argument is the doubt about Chairman (Chiang Kai-shek)'s sincerity and ability to eliminate corruption at all levels of government." Then, the Central News Agency exclaimed: "This is a new trend! Previously, the American newspapers had always excused many of Chiang Kai-shek's sins, but now they no longer do so." It also said: "The Republican New York Herald Tribune openly discussed the possibility of the current government (Chiang government) and Chiang Kai-shek losing their leadership position in China." The St. Louis Post-Dispatch, speaking insolently (!), fiercely criticized: "It seems that Chiang Kai-shek is becoming less and less capable of implementing policies." Wallace's "New Republic" reported that Wedemeyer privately believed that "Chiang Kai-shek is able to eliminate corruption (?), but he refuses to do so." The Herald Tribune pessimistically said: "The hope of reorganizing the government and defeating the Communists seems to be dimming day by day." The Central News Agency further stated: "However, other newspapers still hope that Nanjing will complete a strong and effective cleanup 'before it is too late.' However, they all unanimously advocate that large-scale American aid should be conditional on extensive political and economic reforms and subject to strict supervision. As if to prevent Nanjing from claiming that such supervision would infringe on China's sovereignty in advance, many newspapers have said: given Nanjing's past record of corruption, bribery, and incompetence, aid without supervision is like pouring money into a rat hole." The Chiang government's status as a lackey and the hideous face of American imperialism have been completely exposed in this Central News Agency cable.

### 美报懑怨蒋介石无能　强调严密管制干儿子

　　美报懑怨蒋介石无能
  　强调严密管制干儿子
    【新华社陕北四日电】本月二日中央社驻纽约记者拍给其南京总社的专电中，把一周来美国各报对魏德迈离华声明的评论加以概括。该电暴露了美国资产阶级各派别报纸对蒋介石统治的普遍不满，并承认其危机的深重，同时都指出如果美国不坚持对蒋政府实行“彻底洗刷”，则美国任何援助均挽救不了蒋介石。因而各报强调必须加强“管制”蒋介石，即更加奴化蒋介石，否则“战胜共党的希望就会一天天黯淡”。中央社称：“美国的报纸，全国各方的评论给人以强烈的印象：报界的意见——与美国官方见解有别——关于中国（指蒋政府）的见解仍无重大改变。若有的话，就是不仅仅共产党和接近共产党的报纸，就是持有各种不同政治见解的美国主笔都甚至更加确信：美国不应继续援助中国（蒋介石，直到中央（蒋）政府真正彻底地‘洗刷’为止”。在这里，美国资产阶级报界所谓蒋政府的“真正彻底洗刷”，显然是要求清除“贪污”“颟顸无能”分子而使之成为有效率的反人民内战政府，以及百分之百的美国化的傀儡政权。中央社继称：“南京过去‘改组’政府和实行‘改革’的努力，被许多主笔认为是一种装饰。某些报纸，特别是克利夫兰小兰人报——该报主笔最近曾访问南京——则迳称南京最近的‘改组’是‘欺骗的’。对于美国主笔所认为是纸上改革，怀疑仍然存在着，而更恼人（！）的论调，就是怀疑委员长（蒋介石）对清除各级政府的腐败之诚意和能力。”接着，中央社惊呼：“这是一种新的倾向！在这以前美国报纸一直宽宥了蒋介石的许多罪过，现在不再如此了。”又说：“共和党的先驱论坛报公开的谈论到现政府（蒋政府）和蒋介石失去中国领袖地位的可能性”。出言不逊（！）的路易斯邮报猛烈抨击称：“看起来好象蒋介石一天比一天更不是能够实行政策的人了”。华莱士主编的“新共和”曾报导，魏德迈私人认为“蒋介石能够清除腐化（？），但他却不干。”先驱论坛报悲观地说：“改组政府和战胜共党的希望好象一天比一天更黯淡了”。中央社又称：“但是其他的报纸则仍怀着南京会于‘再迟则来不及’之际，完成强烈而切实的洗刷之希望。不过他们都异口同声地，主张美国的大规模的援助，应以广泛的政治经济改革的条件，并予以严密的监督。好象预先要使南京无从讲出这样的监督会侵害中国主权的理由一样，许多的报纸都曾说：鉴于南京过去贪污、腐化与无能的纪录，不加管制的援助，就好象倾金钱于老鼠洞中。”蒋政府的奴才身份与美帝国主义的狰狞面貌，在此一中央社电文中，已暴露无遗。
