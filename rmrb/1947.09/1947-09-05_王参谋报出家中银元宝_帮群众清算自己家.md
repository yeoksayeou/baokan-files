　　Staff Officer Wang Reports Silver Ingots at Home
  　Helps the Masses Liquidate His Own Family
    [Report from our Taiyue correspondent, dated 3rd] Comrade Wang Jijia, a staff officer of a certain regiment under Chen Geng's command, has a firm stance and is helping the masses thoroughly liquidate his own landlord family. Wang Jijia is from Nanguanzhuang, District One, Jiang County. His father, Wang Longfa, served as village chief and deputy, embezzling, lending at usurious rates, and oppressing the masses. After the liberation of Jiang County, the masses, after seven or eight days of deliberation and discussion, initially overcame their fear of struggling against the Wang Jijia family and began to liquidate his family on July 15th. At this time, Wang Jijia returned home from the army, and the masses' concerns arose again, and some panicked. Some said, "Jijia is back, let's stop." In this situation, Comrade Jijia took the initiative to go to the farmers' association and express his attitude at the mass meeting. He said, "Fellow elders, do not doubt, my family is a feudal landlord family, it must be eliminated, it is the object of struggle. When my father was alive, he ruled our village, embezzled and lent at usurious rates, lending one dou of grain and demanding that the farmers repay two dou, lending money at a monthly interest of five percent, compounding interest, and seizing the farmers' land and houses if they could not repay the debt on time, thus exploiting us into a landlord with two hundred mu of land. Today, the peasants want to stand up and liquidate my feudal family, I am very happy, because today I am a cadre of the people's army led by the Communist Party. Everyone's struggle against my family is correct, otherwise my brothers and sisters-in-law will lag behind and steal things." Based on his understanding, he told the masses the location of his family's property, including more than fifty large stones of stored wheat, more than 1,800 silver dollars, seven silver ingots, more than one hundred catties of copper coins, and two places where clothes and cloth were stored. Jijia was afraid that the masses would not dare to take it, so he told the masses about the current news of our army's victory, explaining that the peasants' liberation was protected by the army. He said, "I am fighting Chiang Kai-shek on the front line, and you are fighting little Chiang Kai-sheks in the village. The army and the people work together to completely eliminate the feudal forces." At the same time, he also mobilized and persuaded his family to unconditionally accept the peasants' reasonable liquidation and hand everything over to the peasants for disposal. From then on, the mass movement in Guanzhuang developed rapidly.

　　王参谋报出家中银元宝
  　帮群众清算自己家
    【本报太岳三日电】陈赓所部某团参谋王吉家同志，立场坚定，帮助群众澈底清算自己地主家庭。王吉家是绛县一区南官庄人，父王龙法，生前历任村长副，贪污放帐，欺压群众。绛县解放后，群众经过七、八天的酝酿讨论，初步克服了不敢斗争王吉家家庭的顾虑，于七月十五日对他家进行清算。这时，王吉家从部队回家，于是群众顾虑又起，有些着慌。有的说：“吉家回来了，咱们算了吧。”在这样情况下，吉家同志便主动去找农会，到群众大会上表明态度。他说：“诸位父老，不要怀疑，我的家庭是封建地主，是要消灭的，是斗争对象，我父亲在世，统治咱村，贪污放帐，出借一斗粮要农民还二斗，放钱一块月利五分，利上加利，限期交不上债的，就把农民的土地、房屋押管，就这样剥削成了二百亩地的地主。今天农民要翻身，清算我的封建家庭，我十分高兴，因为我今天是共产党领导的人民军队的干部，大家对我家的斗争是对的，不然我家哥嫂落后，要偷转东西。”他并根据他的了解，将他家内产藏放地点告诉群众，计有存麦五十余大石，银洋一千八百余元，元宝七个，铜元百余斤，衣服布匹存放地两处。吉家怕群众不敢要，又给群众把目前我军胜利消息讲了一次，说明农民翻身有军队保护。他说：“我在前线打大蒋介石，你们在村打小蒋介石，军民同下手，彻底消灭封建势力。”同时，他又动员劝说他家的人要无条件的接受农民合理清算，一切交农民处理。从此官庄群运迅速展开。
