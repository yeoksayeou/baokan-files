From the perspective of Neiqiu's communication work:
Basic issues in establishing a rural communication network

    After studying the experiences and lessons learned from the successes and failures of Neiqiu's communication work, we have gained some preliminary understanding of the basic issues in establishing a rural communication network.

  I. Who to mobilize and who to rely on?

    Neiqiu's communication work has experienced three ups and downs since it began in 1944. The county office's review of the fundamental reasons is as follows: because the vast majority of correspondents were intellectual cadres, workers and peasants did not dare to "get involved," and the leadership did not pay attention to inspection. Therefore, each time it was active, it would then decline and collapse. At that time, the correspondents relied solely on others to provide materials for writing articles; or they wrote wherever they went; and individual correspondents even produced "Keke" phenomena of hearsay and false reports. Therefore, two contradictions could not be resolved at that time: each time foreign cadres and highly educated intellectual correspondents were transferred, the communication work collapsed. For example, after the Japanese surrendered in 1945, the educated cadres were transferred, and communication reports also declined. Secondly, a contradiction between writing and work arose. For example, the reports in August and September last year were very active, which played a role in promoting conscription, etc. However, from October onwards, the land reform entered the stage of "digging up floating wealth." Correspondents left the organs and were busy leading the masses' struggle, and no one else provided readily available materials, so the reports declined again. By February and March of this year, only a few correspondents continued to write. This formed the phenomenon of three ups and downs in communication reports.

    In April of this year, the county party committee proposed to develop worker-peasant correspondents to report on the great production movement. The county propaganda department specially convened a meeting of responsible cadres from various districts to discuss communication reporting issues, and decided to combine writing with work, calling on workers and peasants to boldly write; explaining that writing can promote central work and improve themselves, and that being a correspondent for the party newspaper is both a responsibility and an honor, etc. In this way, in April, 15 communication groups and 139 correspondents were re-established throughout the county, submitting more than 240 articles. Later, in June, the number of communication groups increased to 21, and the number of correspondents increased to 277; in August, it further increased to 545, with about 50 groups, submitting 519 articles. Blank areas were eliminated, and articles were submitted to the county's small newspaper, the Jixi Minbao, the Taihang Xinhua Daily, and this newspaper, reflecting the aspects, characteristics, and experiences of the spring plowing, summer planting, drought resistance, and famine preparation in the county's production movement, and promoting the development of the movement. Until recently, not only have worker-peasant correspondents accounted for the absolute majority of the county's correspondents, but also worker-peasant backbones such as Wang Shiyong, He Chengfang (born as a hired laborer, still illiterate), and Huo Wenxiu have emerged. In addition to actively writing articles themselves, they also mobilized a large number of hero models and positive activists among poor peasants who emerged in the emancipation movement to participate in the communication network. Huo Wenxiu, the deputy district chief, alone mobilized 13 hero models such as Yan Qi of the Baizhuang base point to participate in the communication network. The communication group at this base point has become a well-known model banner in the county. In particular, due to the characteristics of worker-peasant correspondents, such as going deep into reality, understanding the ideological requirements of the masses, and using collective mutual assistance in writing, the quality of the articles by worker-peasant correspondents in the Third District is higher than that of intellectual correspondents. Among the 14 district cadres in the Fourth District, 13 were born as workers and peasants, and the quality of their reports was the best, and the amount of adoption by various newspapers was the largest. Since April of this year, Neiqiu's communication work has been thriving, and a solid foundation has been laid for the county's rural communication network.

    In comparison, the problem is very clear: Should the establishment of a rural communication network rely on a small number of intellectuals (teachers, cadres)? Or should it rely on the vast number of workers and peasants (liberated hero models, cadres, positive poor and hired peasants, and peasant association members)? The answer is: Only by mobilizing the vast number of workers and peasants to participate in the communication network, and relying on them to firmly grasp rural communication reporting, can rural journalism have broad prospects for development, and all issues such as serving workers, peasants, and soldiers will be easily resolved. Conversely, communication work will not be able to take root in rural areas, and no matter how much mobilization and calls are made, and no matter how lively it is for a while, it will inevitably fall into a state of stagnation and collapse!

    Unreformed intellectual correspondents must first learn the ideological style of worker-peasant correspondents, correct their stance of serving the masses, and then they can tenaciously wield their cultural weapons and cooperate with workers and peasants to jointly promote rural reporting.

  II. How to mobilize and how to improve?

    This is a specific leadership issue on how to achieve the above-mentioned policy. Neiqiu's preliminary experience is nothing more than:

    First, the combination of top-down leadership responsibility and bottom-up mass mobilization is an effective way to break the initial reluctance of worker-peasant comrades to write. Workers and peasants do not have the habit of writing, and many are illiterate or only have a rudimentary understanding of writing. They think, "We don't have the cultural level, we don't get involved!" After the April meeting, responsible comrades from various districts, such as Liu Yuanhai from the Second District and Sun Xuewu from the First District, took the lead in writing articles and mobilized and helped the village cadres to learn to write wherever they worked. Comrade Li Yinggui, the secretary of the Fourth District, even collectively studied materials and divided up the writing tasks at each work meeting, which achieved great results and quickly made the worker-peasant comrades realize that: selecting materials from the central work that can guide others elsewhere, and writing them out after research, is an article. Therefore, in June, hundreds of articles by worker-peasant comrades were submitted to the office requesting publication or suggestions.

    Second, the liaison office should combine with its small newspaper to lead the communication work. After the April meeting, the office specially established a liaison office and restored the "Dazhong Bao," which greatly promoted the communication work. The specific methods are: first, through the liaison office, obtain the support of correspondents' articles and enrich the publication of the "Dazhong Bao"; through the "Dazhong Bao," guide correspondents to write articles, praise good correspondents, and announce reporting guidelines, etc. Secondly, through this organization, maintain close contact with backbone correspondents, and focus on helping and educating rural correspondents, and constantly cultivate new backbones; such as writing individual opinion letters, collective mimeographed letters; publishing "Communication Special Pages," and reviewing correspondents, etc. The content of the "Communication Special Pages" includes monthly summaries of communication work, exchange of reporting experiences, commendation of models, and instructions from the county party committee on communication reporting, etc. The standards for reviewing correspondents are: (1) General correspondents: regularly contact the office. (2) Backbone correspondents: politically clean, actively write articles themselves, promote and help others write articles, and develop new correspondents.

    Third, commend models, carry out merit-making campaigns, and establish banners. From May to July, Neiqiu had already established model communication groups such as Baizhi Chuan, Xianren Village, and Song Village, and model correspondents such as Wang Shixian, Huo Wenxiu, and He Chengfang, which became glorious banners for carrying out, consolidating, and improving the county's communication work. The method is: stipulate that leaders at all levels regard communication work as one of the contents of merit-making in each central work, combine it with the central work, and implement merit evaluation and model commendation. This call was enthusiastically responded to by the correspondents, who said in their letters: "We are determined to make meritorious contributions in writing articles; if I don't get involved in writing articles, I will write more and learn from others." Huo Wenxiu, a worker-peasant cadre who was only rudimentarily literate but actively wrote articles, made the first contribution in May. The characteristics of his communication reports are: meticulous and in-depth work, articles that are practical, and combining the examination of his own work style with communication work. Then, in June, the Wang, Guo, and other communication groups were commended, and in July, the Baizhi Chuan and the Fifth and Sixth District correspondents were commended, etc., which became a regular movement. Experience has proved that: discovering worker-peasant backbones and establishing correspondent banners through commendation and merit-making is one of the important leadership methods for carrying out communication work.

    Fourth, carry out a mutual assistance and self-study movement for correspondents. This is a new problem that has arisen after the widespread establishment of the Neiqiu worker-peasant communication network. Because the new policy has made the worker-peasant communication network develop rapidly, relying solely on the liaison office to consolidate the correspondents' enthusiasm for writing and improve the quality of their articles is already beyond its capacity. Therefore, the office proposed a mutual assistance and self-study movement for correspondents in June, based on the budding experience of mutual assistance in writing by correspondents in the Fourth District. The proposed methods are: (1) go deep into practical work, study and summarize work experience, and grasp prominent materials to write articles; (2) give play to the collective writing of communication groups and the combination of pen and mouth to help each other write; (3) study good news communication and basic business knowledge. After a month, initial results have been achieved: (1) The purely technical viewpoint has been dispelled. Some correspondents were confused after reading the article "Shorter and Shorter," and worriedly said: "If it's too short, I'm afraid I won't be able to explain the problem clearly, and if it's too long, I'm afraid people will say: 'Old lady's bound feet'." The leadership immediately used the example of worker-peasant correspondent Wang Shixian writing articles to let everyone study, and everyone clarified that the quality of an article depends on the quality of its content. (2) Further integration with work. For example, the quality of articles is high when communication groups, work groups, and study groups are unified to help each other write. The Baizhi communication group of 19 people led by Huo Wenxiu and Fan Qintang submitted 19 articles in June and used 10 of them, including one each in this newspaper and the Xinhua Daily. The main reason is as Huo Wenxiu said: "Writing articles depends on whether you can analyze problems and understand the thoughts of the masses; writing articles must be combined with work, and if the work is in-depth, the writing will be accurate."

    从内邱通讯工作来看
    建立农村通讯网的基本问题
    研究了内邱通讯工作失败与成功的经验教训，对于建立农村通讯网的基本问题，有了一些初步的认识。
  一、发动什么人、依靠什么人？
    内邱通讯工作从四四年开展以来曾经三起三落，县办公室检讨基本原因：由于通讯员绝大部份是知识分子干部，工农分子不敢“问津”，领导上也没有注意检查，故每次活跃后随就走向消沉、垮台。当时的通讯员专靠别人供给材料写稿；或者走到那里写到那里；还有个别通讯员产生道听途说，报导失真的“客克”现象。故当时产生两个矛盾没法解决：每次外来干部和文化高的知识分子通讯员调动，通讯工作即垮台，如四五年日寇投降后，有文化的干部调走了，通讯报导也消沉了；了；其次产生写稿与工作矛盾，如去年八、九月报导很活跃，对参军等起了推动作用，可是十月起土改进入“挖浮财”阶段，通讯员离开机关，忙于领导群众斗争，也没有别人供给较现成的材料，报导又消沉下来，到今年二、三月，只剩下几个通讯员继续写稿了。形成通讯报导上三起三落的现象。
    今年四月，县委提出发展工农通讯员报导大生产运动。县宣专门召开各区负责干部会议讨论通讯报导问题，决定写稿和工作结合，号召工农分子大胆写稿；说明写稿能推进中心工作与提高自己，当党报通讯员是责任也是光荣等。如此四月内全县重新建立起十五个通讯小组，一百三十九个通讯员，投稿二百四十余件，以后六月通讯小组增至二十一个，通讯员增至二百七十七人；八月更增至五百四十五人，小组约五十个，投稿五百一十九件，空白区消灭，稿子遍投县小报、冀西民报、太行新华日报以及本报，反映了全县生产运动中的春耕、夏种、抗旱备荒等面貌、特点与经验，推动了运动的发展。到最近为止，不但工农通讯员已占全县通讯员的绝对多数，而且涌出了王世勇、和成芳（雇工出身，尚不识字）、霍文秀等工农骨干。他们除自己积极写稿，同时发动大批翻身运动中涌现出来的英雄模范贫农积极分子参加通讯网；单副区长霍文秀等就发动了白庄基点阎其＠等十三个英雄模范参加到通讯网内，该基点通讯组已成为全县闻名的模范红旗帜。特别是由于工农通讯员具有深入实际，了解群众思想要求与运用集体互助写稿等特点，三区工农通讯员稿子比知识分子通讯员的质量高。四区十四名区干中有十三名是工农出身，报导的稿子质量最好，各报采用量最大；今年四月以后，内邱通讯工作一直是欣欣向荣，全县农村通讯网已打下雄厚的基础。
    对照起来看，问题十分明白：建立农村通讯网依靠少数知识分子（教员、干部）呢？还是广大工农分子（翻身英雄模范、干部、贫雇积极分子、农会员）呢？答案是：只有发动广大工农分子参加组成的通讯网，并依靠他们确掌农村通讯报导，农村新闻工作就有广阔的发展前途，为工农兵服务等一切问题也将容易解决；反之，通讯工作就无法在农村中扎根，无论如何动员号召，也无论一时如何热闹，终必陷于停滞和垮台的结局！
    没有改造好的知识分子通讯员，只有首先学习工农通讯员的思想作风，端正为群众服务立场，然后才能执着自己的文化武器，配合工农共同推进农村报导工作。
  二、怎样发动、怎样提高？
    这是在确定前条方针之后如何实现它的具体领导问题。内邱初步经验不外：
    第一、从上而下首长负责带头与从下而上大家动嘴动笔相结合是打破工农同志开始不敢写稿的有效方法。工农没有写稿习惯，不少还不识字或粗通文字，他们认为“俺没有文化程度，不沾”！今年四月会议后，各区负责同志如二区柳元海，一区孙学悟等同志一面带头写稿，一面工作到那村就发动和帮助该村干部学写稿。四区分书李英贵同志更通过每次工作会议，集体研究材料，分工写稿，均收到极大效果，很快使工农同志体验到：择出中心工作里面能指导别人别地的材料，经过研究写出就是稿子。因此，六月份就有了成百件工农同志的稿子投进办公室要求登报或提意见。
    第二、通联与其小报结合领导通讯工作。四月会议后，办公室专设通联与恢复了“大众报”，对通讯工作起了很大推动作用。其具体作法是：首先，通过通联获得通讯员稿子支持与充实“大众报”出版；通过“大众报”指导通讯员写稿，表扬好通讯员、公布报导方针等。其次，通过这一机构，经常与骨干通讯员保持密切联系，有重点的帮助和教育农村通讯员，不断培养新的骨干；如写个别的意见信，集体的油印信；出“通讯专页”，审查通讯员等。“通讯专页”内容有每月通讯工作总结，交流报导经验，表扬模范以及县委对通讯报导指示之类。审查通讯员标准是：（一）一般通讯员，经常与办公室联系。（二）骨干通讯员，政治上清白，本人积极写稿，推动与帮助别人写稿，发展新通讯员。
    第三、表扬模范、开展立功运动、树立旗帜。从五月至七月，内邱即已树立了白芷川、仙人村、宋村等模范通讯组与王世显、霍文秀、和成芳等模范通讯员，成为开展、巩固和提高全县通讯工作的光荣旗帜。其作法是：规定各级领导把通讯工作当作每次中心工作立功内容之一，结合中心工作，实行评功表模。这一号召博得通讯员热烈响应，他们在信上说：“决心在写稿上立功；我写稿不沾，要多写，向别人学习”。粗通文字，积极写稿给工农干部，霍文秀在五月份立了头功，他在通讯报导上的特点是：工作细致深入，稿子切合实际，并把检查自己的工作作风与通讯工作结合起来。接着六月表扬了王、郭等通讯组，七月表扬了白芷川和五、六区通讯员等，成为经常性运动。经验证明：通过表扬、立功来发现工农骨干树立通讯员旗帜，是开展通讯工作重要的领导方法之一。
    第四、开展通讯员互助自学运动。这是内邱工农通讯网普遍建立后产生的新问题。因为新方针使工农通讯网飞跃发展，单依靠通联工作去巩固通讯员写稿热情和提高稿件质量，已经力不胜任。办公室乃根据四区通讯员互助写稿的萌芽经验，于六月提出通讯员互助自学运动。提出办法：（一）深入实际工作，研究与总结工作经验，抓取突出材料撰写稿子；（二）发挥通讯小组集体写作与笔嘴结合互助写稿；（三）学习好新闻通讯及业务基本知识。时经一月已得初步成绩：（一）打消了单纯技术观点，有的通讯员看了“短些再短些”一文发生错觉，苦恼着说：“短了怕说不明问题，长了又怕人家说：“老娘裹脚”。领导上当即用工农通讯员王世显写稿例子让大家研究，大家明确了稿子好坏决定于内容好坏。（二）进一步和工作结合起来，例如把通讯组与工作组学习组统一起来互助写稿，稿子质量就高；霍文秀、范琴堂领导的白芷通讯组十九人，六月投稿十九件用了十件，内本报及新华日报各一件。主要原因正如霍文秀所说：“写稿看你能不能分析问题，了解群众思想；写稿要和工作结合，工作深入，写稿就写的准”。
