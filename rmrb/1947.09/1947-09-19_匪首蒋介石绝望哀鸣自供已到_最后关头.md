Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, September 17th: At the most unfortunate time in his life, bandit chief Chiang Kai-shek hastily convened the Fourth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang and a joint meeting of the Party and Central Committee. This meeting opened on the 9th of this month and closed on the 13th. On the closing day, the price of rice in Shanghai soared to a peak of 600,000 Chiang coins per stone. The next day, Nanjing declared martial law because the People's Liberation Army under Generals Liu Bocheng and Deng Xiaoping had already reached Wuwei County in Anhui Province, only two hundred miles away from Nanjing. At this meeting, a pessimistic atmosphere permeated the venue. Bandit chief Chiang Kai-shek announced his "final moment" at the meeting, lamenting, "The danger and difficulties are greater than at any time in the past." Chiang Kai-shek boasted at the meeting that "his own military and economic resources can be maintained for at least two years." One of Chiang Kai-shek's frequently used rogue tactics is to scare people, but now this tactic is no longer effective. Another rogue tactic of Chiang Kai-shek is deception. Every time the Chiang party holds a meeting, countless plans and resolutions are usually put forward to deceive people. But this time, even such long and stinky deceptive things were not dared to be taken out. It is said that this is called "governing is not in much talk." The great counter-offensive of the People's Liberation Army and the awakening of the masses of people in the Chiang-controlled areas have battered the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, realizing that scaring and deceiving are no longer effective, and realizing the complete hopelessness of their own future. In order to make a desperate struggle, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang attempted to beg the American imperialists for more help, while at the same time attempting to unite the internally disunited, scheming, corrupt, and contradictory bandit gang itself to prolong the civil war. In order to achieve the purpose of begging, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang exhausted their ugly flattery and rascality, yelling for help and begging for mercy. In order to unite the bandit gang itself, Chiang Kai-shek played two tricks, that is, merging the Three People's Principles Youth League, which had been separated from the Kuomintang a few years ago, back into the Kuomintang, saying that this was to "unify revolutionary forces;" and called on Soong Tzu-wen to initiate the raising of a relief fund, "generously" "donating" the property of the four major families that would be immediately lost due to the great counter-offensive of the People's Liberation Army, such as the investment in the Huainan Railway Coal Mine Company. Political observers believe that these ugly态 and this trick cannot obviously change the situation. Because no matter how much help American imperialism gives to Chiang Kai-shek, it will never be able to save them from their doomed fate. Moreover, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang itself has reached the point of collapse. Observers say that the Chinese people and the People's Liberation Army will give the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang more powerful and continuous blows, and achieve the inevitable nationwide victory.
　　
Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, September 17th: New York, September 11th: Chiang Kai-shek has admitted failure in his attempt to prolong his traitorous, dictatorial, anti-people rule. According to the Daily News today in an editorial commenting on Chiang Kai-shek's speech at the Fourth Plenary Session, "According to reports from Nanjing, the Chairman (referring to Chiang Kai-shek) told the Kuomintang Executive Committee that his efforts over the past twenty years to save China (referring to the rule of the four major families over the disasters of the Chinese people) from crisis have failed." The newspaper sarcastically ridiculed his沮丧 by saying in a humorous tone, "This is the first time we have heard any politician loudly admit that he has failed in everything. This remarkable creativity should make you immortal."

　　匪首蒋介石绝望哀鸣自供已到“最后关头”
    【新华社陕北十七日电】蒋介石在他有生以来最倒霉的时候，忽忙召开国民党四中全会与党团中央联席会议。这个会于本月九日开幕，十三日闭幕。闭幕日上海米价涨到六十万蒋币一石的最高峰，次日南京即宣布戒严，因为刘伯承、邓小平将军所部的人民解放军，已经打到了安徽省的无为县，离南京只有二百余里。在这个会上，悲观空气笼罩会场，蒋介石匪首在该会宣布了他的“最后关头。”发出哀鸣说：“危险困难较之过去任何时期为甚。”蒋介石在会议上的夸口，只是“自己的军事经济资源，至少可以维持两年。”蒋介石所常用的流氓手段之一，即是吓唬人，现在这个手段，已经用不上了。蒋介石的另一种流氓手段是欺骗，蒋党的每次开什么会议，照例有无数的方案与决议拿出来骗人。可是这一次连这种又长又臭的欺骗东西也不敢拿出来。据说这叫做什么“为政不在多言。”人民解放军的巨大反攻与蒋管区人民大众的觉醒，把蒋介石匪帮打得头破血流，认识到吓唬和欺骗已经不灵，认识到自己前途的完全绝望。为了作垂死的挣扎，蒋介石匪帮企图向美国帝国主义乞讨更多一点的帮助，同时企图离心离德、钩心斗角、贪污腐化、矛盾重重的匪帮本身团结起来，把内战延长下去。为了达到求乞的目的，蒋介石匪帮，施尽了丑态献媚和撒赖，叫急和求饶，为了团结匪帮本身，蒋介石玩了两套魔术，这就是把几年前由国民党分出去的三青团再与国民党合并起来，说这是什么“统一革命力量；”并且叫宋子文发起募集什么救济基金，把因为人民解放军大反攻而立即就要失去的四大家族财产如淮南铁路煤矿公司的投资等“慷慨”的“捐输”了出来。政治观察家相信，这些丑态和这套魔术，显然不能改变形势。因为无论美国帝国主义给蒋介石以多少帮助，也决然挽救不了他们死亡的命运。而且蒋介石匪帮本身，也已经到了树倒猢狲散的时候。观察家称：中国人民与人民解放军将给蒋介石匪帮以更有力的连续打击，而取得必然要到来的全国范围的胜利。
    【新华社陕北十七日电】纽约十一日讯：蒋介石对其苟延卖国独裁反人民统治的企图，已自承失败，据每日新闻今日在评论蒋介石四中全会演词的社论中称：“据来自南京的消息，委员长（指蒋介石）曾向国民党执行委员会说，他二十年来挽中国（按指四大家族对中国人民灾难的统治）于危局的努力已经失败了。”该报以幽默口吻讥讽其沮丧称：“这是我们第一次听到任何政治家大声承认他什么事情都失败了。这种卓越的创作力，应使你永垂不朽。”
