　　Exposing the Landlord's Seduction Trap
　　Wen Hongtai Refuses Marriage
　　[This newspaper, Jinan, 15th dispatch] The landlord Hu Zhenzhi of Twelve Mile Village in Wucheng is insidious, cunning, and full of tricks. After the re-examination began, he tried to win over the poor, promising his daughter to the son of An Hongyan, a poor peasant who had just been emancipated, and his niece, Xiao Li, to Wen Hongtai (currently a squad leader in the Public Security Bureau), the second son of Wen Heili of Zhang Village. Wen Heili was temporarily deceived by him and agreed to the marriage. However, Wen Hongtai, upon hearing the news, immediately returned home to persuade his parents to call off the engagement. He said, "I will resolutely not allow our class enemy to enter our home and tarnish the glory of our military dependents." He immediately made a statement of withdrawal. Hu Zhenyuan's shameless conspiracy was shattered, and the masses also saw through his trick and detained him.
