　　"German Industrial Level Conference" Concludes
  　US, Britain, and France Still at Odds
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 2nd] Comprehensive report: The so-called German Industrial Level Conference held by the United States, Britain, and France in London concluded on the 27th without reaching any major agreement. Under the guidance of U.S. Undersecretary of State Clayton and U.S. military commander in Germany Clay, the conference proceeded quietly since its opening on the 22nd, given the significant differences of opinion among the three countries. Occasional news revealed that U.S. representative Murphy had rudely forced the cessation of coal shipments from the Ruhr to France to ensure the needs of Germany's high industrial level, while insisting that France must agree to the increase in Germany's industrial level. On the other hand, French Ambassador to Britain Massigli stated on the 26th that France had not agreed to any German plan during the negotiations, and even if it did agree, it would not receive any return. The closing communique of the three-nation conference issued on the 28th also fully reflected the discord among the three countries in the conference. It stated that during the week-long conference, the U.S. and British representatives "explained" the plans already made by the two countries, while "the French representative 'explained' France's views. Although France agreed with the United States' view that the revival of Germany should be treated equally with the revival of European countries, France's request to greatly revise the U.S. and British plans for German industrial levels was rejected. The U.S., Britain, and France still held their own opinions on the issue of Ruhr coal shipments to France and the operation and control of the Ruhr coal mines."

　　“德国工业水平会议”散场
  　美英法仍同床异梦
    【新华社陕北二日电】综合报导：美英法三国在伦敦召开的所谓德国工业水平会议，已于二十七日以未获重大协议而宣告结束。此次会议在美副国务卿克莱顿及德境美军司令克莱指导下，鉴于三国意见殊多分歧，自二十二日开会以来，即悄然进行。偶然透露出来的消息。则称：美代表莫菲曾粗鲁地强迫停止鲁尔煤输法，以保证德国工业高度水平之需要，同时坚持法必须同意德国工业水平的提高。另方面，法国驻英大使马西格里在二十六日表示，法国在谈判中未曾同意任何德国计划，就是同意也不能得到任何回报。二十八日发表的三国会议的结束公报，亦充分反映三国在该会议中的同床异梦。内称：一周会议中，美英代表“解释”了该两国的已订计划，“法国代表则‘说明’了法国的意见。虽然法国同意美国如下的观点：即对德国的复兴应与对欧洲各国的复兴一视同仁，但法国要求大大修改美英对德工业水平计划的意见，则被拒绝。鲁尔煤输法问题及鲁尔煤矿经营与管制问题，美英与法国仍各持己见。”
