Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th: Reports from various sources indicate that the second session of the United Nations General Assembly will be held in New York on the 16th, and representatives from various countries have set off one after another. The head of the Soviet delegation, Vyshinsky, arrived in London on the 9th via Paris on the 8th and will soon transfer to New York. The head of the Ukrainian delegation is Manuilsky, Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers and Minister of Foreign Affairs of that country. The head of the Belarusian delegation is Ikseliyev, Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers and Minister of Foreign Affairs of that delegation. Bevin, Marshall, and Bidault are the heads of the British, American, and French delegations respectively, and are all preparing to attend the meeting. It is reported that there are more than 60 issues to be discussed, among which the more important ones are the US conspiracy to amend the veto power in the United Nations Charter, the so-called border disputes between Greece and South, Bulgaria, and Albania, as well as the British-Egyptian dispute, Palestine, and the Spanish question. In addition, Dominica and Argentina have also put forward a so-called proposal to revise the peace treaty with Italy, in an attempt to undermine the principle of unanimity among the five major powers of the United Nations on the issue of amending the veto power. The Chiang Kai-shek government has repeatedly acted as a mouthpiece for the United States. After Jiang government Foreign Minister Wang Shijie made a statement in Beijing on the 5th against the veto power, according to the Associated Press, Wang Shijie publicly stated in Shanghai on the evening of the 5th: "China (Chiang) will support the amendment to the use of the veto power." Soviet representative Gromyko, in the Security Council on the 27th of last month, criticized the United States for raising the issue of amending the veto power at the United Nations General Assembly, and said that such a plot would be doomed to failure.

　　第二届联大将在纽约举行
  　各国代表启程前往
  　美阴谋修改联合国宪章
    【新华社陕北十三日电】各方讯，第二届联合国大会将于十六日在纽约举行，各国代表已纷纷启程。苏联代表团团长维辛斯基，八日经巴黎于九日抵伦敦，即将转赴纽约。乌克兰代表团团长为该国部长会议副主席兼外长曼奴意斯基，白俄罗斯代表团团长为该团部长会议副主席兼外长依克雪列夫。贝文、马歇尔、比道尔分任英、美、法代表团团长，均准备赴会。所讨论之问题，据息约六十余件，其中较重要者，有美国阴谋修改联合宪章中之否决权问题，所谓希腊与南、保、阿三国之边境纠纷，以及英、埃纠纷，巴勒斯坦，西班牙问题等。此外，多米尼加与阿根廷又提出一项所谓修改对意和约的议案，在企图破坏联合国五强一致原则之修改否决权问题上，蒋介石政府一再作美国之应声虫。蒋政府外长王世杰五日在京发表反否决权之谈话后，据美联社讯，五日晚王世杰在沪又公开谈称：“中国（蒋）将支持修改否决权的使用。”苏代表葛罗米柯于上月二十七日之安理会中，曾对美国将在联合国大会提出修改否决权问题予以指责，并谓此种图谋必遭失败。
