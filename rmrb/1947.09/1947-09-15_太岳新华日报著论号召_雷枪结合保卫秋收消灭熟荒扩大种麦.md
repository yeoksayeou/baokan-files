　　*Taiyue Xinhua Daily* Editorial Calls for Combining Mines and Guns to Protect the Autumn Harvest, Eliminate Cultivated Wasteland, and Expand Wheat Planting

　　[This newspaper, Taiyue, 12th] *Taiyue Xinhua Daily* recently published an editorial titled "Launch the Autumn Harvest, Autumn Planting, and Grain Protection Movement." It began by stating: This year has seen "spring drought and autumn floods." Since the beginning of autumn, incessant rain has threatened the autumn crops with "returning to green," etc. In addition, in order to win greater victories on the front lines and support the front line tasks, which are quite pressing, and given the shortage of labor, it is even more important to give full play to the organized strength, expand the labor force, especially by organizing the broad masses of women and children to go to the fields together. It is also necessary to take care of the autumn harvest for the militiamen and laborers on expeditions and the military families without labor, and ensure that their grain is harvested. Secondly, due to the poor harvests in some areas in both summer and autumn this year, it is necessary to increase the income of next year's summer grain. In the core areas, many places have made significant achievements in preparing for wheat planting and expanding wheat fields, eliminating cultivated wasteland, and some have even opened up much virgin land. However, there are still many places where a considerable amount of cultivated wasteland has not been reclaimed, and it is urgent to continue to seize the time to eliminate all cultivated wasteland. In the border areas, due to the enemy's frantic grain grabbing, the masses' enthusiasm for production is low, and various preparations for wheat planting have not yet been made. This phenomenon needs to be overcome urgently. It is necessary to know that the situation in the border areas is changing rapidly. We must look forward and make long-term plans, and not lose the opportunity for cultivation due to temporary phenomena. The borderland armed forces must cover the masses' rush planting, and the government, cooperatives, etc., must find ways to solve the difficulties of seeds, etc. The new districts should also take time to plant wheat. When it comes to autumn harvest and planting in the border areas, it is necessary to earnestly implement the combination of labor and military affairs, and the combination of mines and guns, to protect the autumn harvest. Although the enemy on the Tongpu Line is in a difficult situation and lacks supplies, it is precisely because of this that the enemy is bound to frantically plunder the people's grain to prolong their survival, and their methods will be even more vicious and their conspiracies even more novel. The inhumane铡刀 (zhádāo -铡刀 is a large knife used for chopping) policy implemented by the enemy in Pingyao and Jiexiu is an example of this. The military and civilians in the border areas must be highly vigilant, overcome the existing and potentially emerging ideas of paralysis and luck, and act in unison to implement quick harvesting, quick fighting, and quick hiding, and strive for early "field cleared, threshing ground cleared, courtyard cleared," and fight to protect grain. Our borderland militia and local armed forces, in the situation where the main force is concentrating on annihilating the enemy in large numbers, must independently and autonomously take on the glorious task of protecting the people, recognize that protecting grain is protecting the people's lives, which is the inherent duty of our people's armed forces, and is also the most effective way for us to encircle and even eliminate the enemy. Finally, it pointed out: The main experience of the grain protection struggle is the combination of mines and guns, which is the best means whether we are attacking or blockading and defending. In particular, every cave entrance and kiln door where grain is stored should be universally mined. Even if the enemy grabs some grain, they will have to pay a greater price. If the enemy snatches a grain from me, I will take a drop of their blood.

### 太岳新华日报著论号召　雷枪结合保卫秋收消灭熟荒扩大种麦

　　太岳新华日报著论号召
  　雷枪结合保卫秋收消灭熟荒扩大种麦
    【本报太岳十二日电】太岳新华日报顷以“展开秋收秋耕与护粮运动”为题，发表社论。首称：今年“春旱秋涝”，入秋以来，霪雨不断，秋禾就有“回青”等的危险；加上为了争取前线更大的胜利，支援前线任务相当紧迫，在这样劳动力缺乏的情况下，更应高度发挥组织起来的力量，扩大劳动力，尤其是将广大的妇女儿童等组织起来，一齐上地，并要照顾远征民兵民夫及无劳力军属的秋收，保证把他们的粮食收回来。其次，由于今年若干地区夏秋两季歉收，必须增加明年夏粮的收入。在腹心地区，关于准备种麦及扩大麦田，许多地方已作出显著的成绩，消灭了熟荒，有的并开了许多生荒，但是仍有许多地方，尚有相当数量的熟荒没有开垦，亟须继续争取时间，全部消灭熟荒。在边沿地区，由于敌人疯狂的抢粮，群众生产情绪低落，对种麦至今尚未作各种准备，这种现象亟须克服。须知边沿区的情况是日新月异的在变化着，我们要向前看，要作长期打算，万勿因一时的现象而失去了耕种的时机。边地武装要掩护群众抢种，政府、合作社等要想法解决种子等等困难，新区也应抽出时间种麦。谈到边沿地区秋收秋种上，须切实实行劳武结合、雷枪结合，以保卫秋收。目前同蒲线的敌人虽处境窘迫，给养困难，但是就正因为如此，敌人势必要疯狂的抢夺人民的粮食以延残喘，而且其手段将更加毒辣，阴谋更加翻新。目前平、介敌实行的惨无人道的铡刀政策，即其例证。边地军民，要高度警惕起来，克服已有及可能滋生的麻痹侥幸等思想，一致行动起来，实行快收、快打、快藏，争取早日地光、场光、院光，为保卫粮食而斗争。我边地民兵及地方武装，要在主力集中大量歼灭敌人的情况下，独立自主的负起保卫人民的光荣任务，认识保卫粮食就是保卫人民的生命，就是我们人民武装应尽的天职，同时也是我们围困以至消灭敌人的最有效的办法。最后指出：护粮斗争的主要经验是雷枪结合，无论我们是进攻或封锁防御，都是最好的手段，尤其是每个藏粮的洞口窑门，都普遍埋上雷，敌人即是抢走一些粮食，也要他付出更多的代价，敌抢我一颗粮，我要他一滴血。
