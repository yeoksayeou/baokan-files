    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, September 22nd: New York Dispatch: Vyshinsky's speech at the UN General Assembly has garnered sympathy and praise from delegates of many countries. Polish Chief Delegate, Modzelewski, stated: "Vyshinsky spoke very clearly, all countries desire peace, it is the enemies of peace who are creating an atmosphere of war preparedness." Syrian representative from the Middle East, Huly, said: "Vyshinsky's speech was great, giving the reactionaries 'a head-on blow'." Lebanese representative, Malik, stated: "This is a very interesting and excellent speech, it mentioned the key points of many issues; and analyzed them clearly, in this respect, Vyshinsky made a great contribution to the United Nations General Assembly." Iraqi representative, Jimili, stated: "I have always been in favor of countries expressing their opinions frankly, which is of great help to international understanding." Chilean representative from Latin America, Shar, said: Vyshinsky's speech was very powerful; Venezuelan representative, Stuck, said: "For the first time in an international conference, there was such a powerful speech;" Guatemalan representative, Granlay, said: This speech was very "bold." Former Foreign Minister of the Spanish Republic, De Vayo, who attended the conference, said: "This speech clearly and powerfully expressed the Soviet Union's desire for peace. I was honored to visit the Soviet Union last year. Therefore, I know that this speech reflects the wishes of the Soviet people, who are 100% in favor of defending peace. This speech made a very good impression on many people."

    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, September 22nd: According to TASS and other New York dispatches: Vyshinsky's speech at the UN General Assembly dealt a heavy blow to US imperialists and their followers, and made them disgraced. New York Assemblyman Sayler, who attended the hearing, exclaimed "Oh my god! Oh my god!" when he heard Vyshinsky reveal the attempt of US monopoly capital to find a way out of war; and list their staggering profits, and was expelled from the venue for disrupting the order of the meeting. US representative Dulles, because Vyshinsky pointed out that he was one of the "war mongers," hurriedly wrote a statement at the meeting, asking the newspaper editor to publish it quickly, in order to defend himself. The editorial of the New York Herald Tribune was full of hostile comments on Vyshinsky's speech, but had to admit that Vyshinsky's speech was "excellent" and "ingeniously structured"; and admitted that Vyshinsky's accusations "hit the weak points of American policy." The New York Times and other newspapers could not provide arguments when refuting Vyshinsky's speech, and the structure of the article appeared very chaotic. The liberal newspaper, the New York Afternoon Post, believed that Vyshinsky's speech was like an indictment, and the defendant was the American war mongers. British representative McNair tried his best not to pay attention to the seriousness of Vyshinsky's accusations against the war mongers, but also said that Vyshinsky's speech "was the most vivid speech of the conference." French Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Barro, said: "That was the most severe speech."

    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, September 22nd: Dispatches from various sources: Vyshinsky's speech at the United Nations General Assembly on the 18th has been given great importance by all parties. When Vyshinsky spoke, the venue was packed, and the audience was particularly crowded. Most of the audience responded with continuous applause. Vyshinsky's speech was published by Soviet newspapers in full and continuously, and broadcast by Soviet radio stations in multiple languages. The United Nations General Assembly also broadcast Vyshinsky's speech in Russian, English, French, Chinese, Spanish, Portuguese, Dutch, Arabic, and Turkish. Journalists from various countries rushed to the Secretariat to obtain the full text of Vyshinsky's speech and sent it back to their countries; even the organ newspaper of the US Democratic Party and the semi-official newspaper, the New York Times, and the organ newspaper of the Republican Party, the New York Herald Tribune, also published the full text of Vyshinsky's speech.

    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, September 23rd: Moscow Dispatch: Izvestia recently commented on the UN General Assembly, saying: Marshall's speech at the conference and the conference itself prove that the US representative is trying to turn the United Nations General Assembly from a place where countries jointly decide major peace policies into a stage for "diplomatic war" against the Soviet Union and various democratic countries, and to turn the United Nations Charter from a weapon for striving for peace into a tool for unilateral American policy. The situation in the first few days of the United Nations General Assembly has shown that the "diplomatic war" loudly proclaimed by the US representative cannot be easily turned into a "conquest march." There are now not a few countries that truly safeguard peace and security, first of all, the Soviet Union. Vyshinsky's speech has stated the Soviet Union's position in safeguarding the interests of peace-loving countries. This speech gave a profound and principled refutation to the instigators of new wars, who endanger the foundations of peaceful coexistence among countries. Vyshinsky's speech stirred up chaos in the ranks of the "gravediggers" of the United Nations General Assembly, but was unanimously praised by countries that truly support peace and hundreds of millions of people around the world (including the American people). Foreign newspapers believe that the Second United Nations General Assembly is a "serious test" for the United Nations. The question now is to test the will of other great powers for international cooperation. From this perspective, the significance of this session of the General Assembly is very important.

    维辛斯基演说给反动分子当头一棒
    获得多数国家代表赞扬
    美代表及其附和者狼狈不堪
    联大开会头几天已显示出来：
    苏联及多数国家维护和平
    美反和平“外交战”必受挫
    【新华社陕北二十二日电】纽约讯：维辛斯基在联大的演说，获得了许多国家与会代表的同情与赞许。波兰首席代表莫塞莱夫斯基称：“维辛斯基说得很清楚，所有的国家都希望和平，制造备战空气的是和平的敌人。中东国家叙利亚代表胡理称：维辛斯基的演说很伟大，给予反动分子“当头一棒。”黎巴嫩代表迈力克称：“这是一篇非常富有趣味的出色演说，它提到许多问题的要点；且分析得清清楚楚，在这一点上，维氏对联合国大会贡献很大”。伊拉克代表吉米里称：“我一向赞成各国坦白表示意见，这对国际间的谅解大有帮助。”拉丁美洲国家智利代表沙说：维氏演说很有力；委内瑞拉代表斯都克说：“在国际会议上，破天荒第一次有这样有力的演说；”危地马拉代表格兰莱说：这篇演说很“果敢”。列席大会的前西班牙共和国外交部长德瓦若说：“这篇演说清楚和有力的表现出苏联对和平的愿望，我很荣幸能在去年去访问苏联。因此，我知道这篇演说反映出苏联人民的愿望，他们是百分之百的卫护和平的。这篇演说给很多人以很好的印象。”
    【新华社陕北二十二日电】据塔斯社等纽约讯：维辛斯基在联大的演说，给予美帝国主义者及其附和者以深重打击，并使之狼狈不堪。美国出席旁听的纽约议员赛勒，当他听到维辛斯基揭露美国独占资本企图从战争中找出路；并历举他们惊人的利润时，他惊呼“天啊！天啊！”而以破坏会场秩序被逐出会场。美代表杜勒斯因维氏指出他是“战争贩子”之一，他急急忙忙的在会场写了一个声明，叫报纸编辑赶快登载，好为他自己辩护。纽约先驱论坛报的社论充满了对维氏演说敌意的评论，但却不得不承认维氏演说“很出色”，“结构很巧妙”；并承认维氏的责难“正击中美国政策的弱点”。纽约时报等在反驳维氏演说时，提不出论据来，文章的章法显得很混乱。自由主义的报纸美国下午报则认为维氏的演说象一个控诉，被告是美国的战争贩子。英代表麦克纳尔尽量想不重视维氏演说中对于战争贩子责难的严重性，但也说维氏演说“是大会最生动的演说”。法国驻联合国永久代表巴罗说：“那是一个最严厉的演说”。
    【新华社陕北二十二日电】各方讯：十八日维辛斯基在联合国大会的演讲，各方均极为重视。当维氏演说时，会场座无虚席，旁听者特别拥挤。大部份听众报以不断的鼓掌。维氏的演说，苏联各报用全部篇幅连续登载，苏联广播电台用多种语言广播。联合国大会也将维氏演说用俄文、英文、法文、中文、西班牙文、葡萄牙文、荷兰文、阿拉伯文、及土耳其文广播，各国新闻记者，争向秘书处索取维氏演说全文，拍发回国；甚至美国民主党的机关报及半官方报纸纽约时报，与共和党机关报纽约先驱论坛报，也登载了维氏演说的全文。
    【新华社陕北廿三日电】莫斯科讯：消息报顷评联大称：马歇尔在大会上的演说及大会本身，都证明美国代表企图把联合国大会从各国协同决定主要和平政策的场所变为反苏反各民主国家的“外交战”的舞台，把联合国宪章由争取和平的武器，变为单方面的美国政策的工具。联合国大会开头几天的情形已经显示：美国代表大声宣叫的“外交战”，并不能轻易的变为“征服游行”。现在真正维护和平和安全的国家并不在少数，首先就是苏联。维辛斯基在演说中已表明苏联的立场在卫护爱好和平各国的利益，这一演说给于新的战争挑拨者以深刻的原则性的驳斥，这些战争挑拨者危害着各国和平生存的基础。维辛斯基的演说激起了联合国大会“掘墓者”队伍的混乱，却获得真正拥护和平的国家及全世界千百万人民（包括美国人民在内）的一致赞扬。外国的报纸认为第二届联合国大会是联合国“严重的考验”。现在的问题是要考验其他强国对国际合作的意志，从这个意义讲，本届大会的意义就很重要。
