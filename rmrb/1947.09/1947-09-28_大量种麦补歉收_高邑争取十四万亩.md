    Mass Wheat Planting to Make Up for Poor Harvest: Gaoyi Strives for 140,000 Mu
    [Our Newspaper Gaoyi News] Since the county leadership called on the masses to calculate the harvest and launched a campaign to save and overcome the famine, the masses in various villages have successively regarded their own families as a general calculation, raised their vigilance, and came up with ways to overcome the famine. In addition to collecting a large amount of vegetables, they also planted a large amount of wheat. In the discussions on overcoming the famine, the masses proposed: To overcome the famine, we must plant more wheat. At the labor model meeting in the first district, the heroes made wheat planting plans. The emancipated peasant Han Zhihe said: "We planted less wheat last year, and suffered a great loss. This year, whether we are overcoming the famine or not, we have to plant more wheat. I will plant 13 mu of wheat on my 20 mu of land." The masses in Dongqiu Village calculated the accounts for the whole village and were short of three months of grain. The masses proposed the slogan: "One wheat crop is worth three autumn harvests. We cannot harvest 100 shi without planting 100 mu." The village planned to plant half of its land with wheat. Wang Fasen's model mutual aid group in the county plans to complete the soil preparation and sowing of wheat before the Mid-Autumn Festival, and put forward the slogan "Early planting is three sheng thick, late planting is five sheng thin." In order to ensure more wheat, the masses in Beijiao launched a campaign to scrape grass and soil to accumulate fertilizer. On the 8th, more than 500 people launched a three-day surprise attack, scraping 2,800 carts of grass and soil, which can be composted into 180 circles, solving the fertilizer problem for 1,400 mu of wheat land in the village. The county and district agencies also participated in this movement. The Public Security Bureau plans to return 100 mu of good land that is currently cultivated to the masses and reclaim wasteland for wheat planting. The county government is also preparing to return the 47 mu of land that was previously cultivated to the masses and reclaim 100 mu of wasteland for wheat planting (80 mu of wasteland has now been reclaimed, and some have been cultivated twice). In order to complete the wheat planting, we launched a campaign of plowing as we harvest during the autumn harvest. Mofang Village even created a method of plowing and preparing the wheat land during the autumn harvest: plowing the land in the morning when there is dew, and harvesting the grain in the daytime. In the eight-day surprise autumn harvest, the entire village's 467 mu of wheat land was plowed four times, and most villages achieved harvesting one piece and plowing one piece. Now the masses in the county are working hard on one hand to harvest the autumn crops, and on the other hand actively accumulating fertilizer, plowing the wheat land and stubble land, and striving to sow 140,000 mu of wheat.

    大量种麦补歉收
    高邑争取十四万亩
    【本报高邑讯】高邑自县领导上号召群众算年成帐，开展节约渡荒后，各村群众先后将自己家当作了总计算，提高了警惕，想出了渡荒办法，除大量采菜外，就是大量种麦，各村讨论渡荒中群众提出：想渡过荒年必须多种麦。一区劳模会上各英雄订出了种麦计划，翻身农民韩之合说：“去年种麦少，吃了大亏，今年不用说渡荒、不渡荒也得多种麦哩，我的二十亩地要种十三亩麦子。”东邱村全村群众算了帐，整短三个月的粮食，群众提出：“一麦顶三秋，不种百亩不能收百石”的口号，全村土地计划种麦一半。全县模范互助王发森组计划在中秋节前，要完成刹麦地下种，提出“早种三升稠，晚种五升稀”的口号。北焦群众为了保证多打麦，全村开展了刮草土积肥运动，在八日开始五百余人突击了三天，刮草土二千八百车，可沤肥一八○圈，解决了全村一千四百亩麦地的肥料。县区各机关也同样参加了这一运动，公安局计划将现在种的好地，退回群众一百亩另开荒来种麦。县政府也预备将过去种的四十七亩地，退给群众，开荒一百亩来种麦（现在已开出生荒八十亩，有些已耕了两次）。为了完成种麦，在秋收中开展了随收随耕，磨方村更创造了秋收耕刹麦地的办法：早上有露水耕刹地，白天割谷收秋，在八天的突击秋收中，将全村四六七亩刹麦地普耕了四次，大部村作到了收一块耕一块。现在全县群众正在紧张着一面秋收，一面积极积肥料，耕刹麦地耕茬地，为十四万亩麦子下种而努力。（高邑联合办公室、文彦）
