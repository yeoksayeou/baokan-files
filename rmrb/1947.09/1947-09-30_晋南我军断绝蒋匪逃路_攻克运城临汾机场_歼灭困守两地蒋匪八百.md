Xinhua News Agency, Jinji Luyu, 28th. The Taiyue Liberation Army successively captured the Yuncheng and Linfen airports, the air force bases of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in southern Shanxi, annihilating more than 800 enemies. As our Chen and Xie counter-offensive army continuously annihilated the Chiang Kai-shek bandit army in western Henan, the Chiang Kai-shek army trapped in Yuncheng and Linfen became increasingly panicked. They first airlifted the 83rd Brigade stationed in Yuncheng to the south on the 16th. After the Liberation Army discovered this, they captured the airport on the evening of the 18th, cutting off their escape route. On the 20th, the enemy in the city attempted to break through our encirclement, leading their 84th Brigade's 250th Regiment and the 23rd Brigade's Independent Regiment, dividing into three routes to attack: one route snuck into Yuanwangzhuang, one route attacked Yingfang to the northwest, and another route snuck north to attack Qiaotou. All were severely attacked by the Liberation Army, annihilating more than 350 enemies including the regimental commander and deputy regimental commander. The remaining enemies fled back into the city in a panic. The enemy in Linfen also began airlifting west on the 21st. The Liberation Army began occupying strongholds such as Xiaojia, Xiaocheng, Qili, Zhangwu, Chaimu, and Wangzhuang outside the airport on the 22nd. On the 24th, they completely controlled the airport, annihilating the entire 3rd Battalion of the 89th Regiment of the 30th Division and some miscellaneous bandits who were trapped in the strongholds, including the commander of the 3rd Battalion of the 89th Regiment, Zhang Zhongtai, and the captain of the Fushan Security Police Corps, totaling more than 520 killed, wounded, and captured. They seized 2 mortars, 2 small cannons, 34 light and heavy machine guns, and many other materials.

Taiyue, 28th. The emancipated peasants of Yishi, southern Shanxi, participated in the siege of Yuncheng, defending the emancipation struggle. They organized short and capable armed forces, actively operating day and night in the surrounding villages of Nanbeijingcun, Dongxizhangzhuang, Beili, Xili, and Fengxian, covering the distribution of struggle fruits in Dongxizhangzhuang, Beili, Xili, and Fengxian. The agricultural preparatory committee of the Second District also decided: (1) The villages in front should hold guns in one hand and distribute land in the other, while protecting the villages behind to carry out land reform. (2) Strengthen sentry posts, joint village defense, and stipulate liaison signals. (3) Establish intelligence stations, with dedicated personnel in the district to do intelligence work.
