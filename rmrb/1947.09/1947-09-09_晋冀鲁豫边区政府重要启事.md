　　Important Announcement from the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region Government

　　Recently, some elements have been impersonating this government and forging this government's official seal and travel permits, engaging in reckless activities in × area, clearly intending to undermine the government's authority. In addition to legal action, from now on, regardless of who it is or what kind of documents they carry, if they engage in illegal activities or act suspiciously, they should be arrested and interrogated immediately. It is hoped that military and political organs, militia posts in all areas will pay close attention!

　　晋冀鲁豫边区政府重要启事
    近有假冒本府，伪造本府长戳路条之分子，在×地胡作非为，显系故意破坏政府威信。除法办外，今后不论何人，带有何种证件，如有不法行为，或行迹可疑者，即应逮捕审讯。尚希各地军政机关民兵岗哨严密注意为荷！
