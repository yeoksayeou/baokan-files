　　Old Liberated Area of Xingtai Exchanges Wheat Seeds
    [Report from this newspaper, Xingtai] In recent years, wheat in the old liberated area has generally suffered from yellow dwarf disease. Last year, Section Chief Feng of the Civil Affairs Section of the county government selected two or three *dou* of wheat seeds from dry land in the new liberated area and conducted an experiment in Fengjiagou in the old liberated area. The wheat seeds transferred from the new area were plump and full. Therefore, this year, Section Chief Wang of the Second Section paid attention to seed selection when storing wheat grain, selecting good wheat from dry land in the new area, collecting 200,000 *jin* and storing it in five warehouses. At the recent county-wide meeting of economic cadres, it was distributed to various districts in the old liberated area, allowing the masses to obtain seeds from the new area, with the old liberated area repaying wheat (jin for jin). If they do not have wheat, they can pay according to the market price. Cadres in the old liberated area were all smiles and praised this method. (Tingzhen, Zhang Qing, Xi Zhen)

　　邢台老区调换麦种
    【本报邢台讯】老区近几年来的麦子普遍发生黄黑疸病，经去年县府民政科冯科长在新区旱地选了二、三斗麦种到老区冯家沟试验结果，新区调来的麦种丰润饱满。因此今年二科王科长在囤麦粮时，就注意了选种工作，把新区旱地的好麦子，选集了二十万斤分存于五个仓库，在这次全县的经济干部扩大会分配给老区各区，让群众到新区取种，老区还麦（斤对斤），如没有麦子的可按市价交款，老区干部听此办法，无不喜笑称赞。（庭珍、张青、西箴）
