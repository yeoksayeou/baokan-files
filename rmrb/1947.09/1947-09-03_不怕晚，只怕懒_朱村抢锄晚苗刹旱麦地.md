　　It's Not the Latness That Matters, It's Laziness
　　Zhu Village Rushes to Weed Late Seedlings and Fight Drought in Wheat Fields
　　[This newspaper, Taiyue, 31st dispatch] In Yangcheng's Zhu Village, because the Beginning of Autumn (立秋) has passed, everyone's enthusiasm for production was low, and they only focused on sideline occupations. After discovering this situation, the village immediately convened a village-wide production meeting to discuss this important matter. Finally, a consensus was reached: "It's not the lateness that matters, it's just laziness! As long as we plant more carefully and weed diligently, a 30% harvest can be increased to 60%!" The leadership also used commendations and rewards to stimulate and consolidate everyone's emotions. On the spot, 51-year-old Wang Shuxiang said to another old woman, Wang Xiaofeng: "I want to lead everyone to weed the fields and also spin yarn. What about you?" Wang Xiaofeng said: "I will lead in cotton ginning and cutting flower reeds without delaying cooking!" This sparked a great production competition, with more weeding and planting of vegetables. The next day, Wang Shuxiang led seven women to weed late seedlings for Xing Deyu's family. In seventeen workdays, they weeded five mu of soybeans, five and a half mu of corn, and two mu each of cotton and sesame. From the 17th to the 20th, in four days, the whole village rushed to plant 5,209 mu of rapeseed, weeded 650 mu of seedlings, and combatted drought on 19,109 mu of wheat fields.
　　[This newspaper, South Hebei, 31st dispatch] This year's drought in Jize lasted until the hottest period, with no significant rainfall. Most villages were a landscape of red earth. However, villages near Fengguanying were thriving, with sorghum and millet growing uniformly. The farmers were all smiling. The reason is that the villages near Fengguanying had previously dug ditches and canals, improved the land last autumn, and launched a surprise attack on soil turning this spring. When challenged by Wu Guanying, labor hero Chen Guangfu led forty-two mutual aid groups to completely turn over more than forty qing of land. The sorghum and millet were planted early. While other villages were still turning soil, the autumn seedlings in this village had already grown a foot high, and a bumper harvest is now in sight. Some of the masses said: "At first, everyone said to overthrow relying on heaven for food, and I thought that was nonsense. How can people eat without the heavens? Now I know that we can eat without relying on heaven. If it weren't for the Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army leading us to dig ditches and turn the soil, how could our crops grow better than other villages!"

　　不怕晚，只怕懒
  　朱村抢锄晚苗刹旱麦地
    【本报太岳三十一日电】阳城朱村，因立秋已过，大家对生产劲头不大，只重副业。该村发现此一情况后，立刻召集全村生产大会，讨论这件大事。最后得出了一致的意见：“不怕晚，光怕懒！只要多种细锄，三分年成就可增至六成收！”领导上又以表模报功，刺激与巩固大家的情绪，当场五十一岁的老婆王书香向另一老婆王小凤说：“我要领导大家锄地，还要纺织，你怎么办？”王小凤说：“我领导打花顶，切花占，不误做饭！”由此掀起了生产大竞赛，多锄苗，多种菜。第二天王书香就领导七个妇女给邢德裕家锄晚苗，十七个工就锄了豆子五亩，玉茭五亩半，棉花芝麻各二亩。全村从十七日开始，至二十日四天内，共抢种油菜五千二百零九亩，锄苗六百五十亩，刹旱麦地一万九千一百零九亩。
    【本报冀南三十一日电】鸡泽今年天旱，直到上伏，没有下过四指雨，多数村庄，一片红地，但逢官营附近村庄，高粱、谷子已莠齐，农民都眉开眼笑，原因是逢官营附近曾经挖沟挑渠，去秋把地搞好，今春突击翻土时，与吴官营挑战，劳动英雄陈光府带领四十二个互助组，把四十余顷地完全翻好，高粱与谷子都种的早，别的村才翻土，该村秋苗已长一尺高，现已丰收在望，有的群众就说：“开初都说打倒靠天吃饭，我认为那是胡说八道，人离了老天爷还能吃饭，现在才知道不靠天也能吃饭，咱村要不是共产党、八路军领导挑沟翻土，庄稼怎能比别村长的好呢！”
