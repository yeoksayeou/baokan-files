    Combining Rectification of Mutual Aid Teams
    to Inspire the Clearing of Village Public Property
    The Second District of Changzhi Achieves Experience in Financial Consolidation
    [This newspaper Changzhi News] The Second District proposed financial consolidation at the district and village cadre meeting on August 8th, focusing on the current rectification of mutual aid teams, and combined with it. Considerable achievements have been made in twenty days. According to statistics from thirty-three villages (out of thirty-six villages in the district), assets worth approximately 19.9 million yuan have been consolidated, and most villages have invested in production. Among them, Su Dian, Gao He, and Zhen Zhang villages started early, grasped tightly, and achieved the greatest results. Su Dian consolidated 2.2 million yuan and invested part of it in a iron and wood factory, earning 200,000 yuan in foreign currency in one month, laying the foundation for the village's self-sufficiency in funding. Gao He consolidated 1.5 million yuan and immediately established an oil mill and designed a dyeing workshop. Zhen Zhang consolidated 700,000 yuan and is designing to open a repair shop based on the conditions (near the highway). In short, in the process of financial consolidation, the correct path of production for self-sufficiency has begun to be explored, and many experiences have been created, laying a good foundation for further carrying out the financial consolidation movement. Based on this foundation, the district and village cadre meeting on the 8th and 9th of this month launched a comprehensive financial consolidation movement centered on wheat planting. Preliminary resolution of several ideological issues: (1) Starting from accounting, enlighten cadres and the masses to recognize the financial difficulties and the importance of financial consolidation. At the beginning of the movement, it is common to encounter negative and resistant thoughts such as "there is nothing to consolidate" and "consolidation is useless." This requires patiently using accounting methods to make cadres and the masses realize the difficulties from calculating expenses, burdens, and family property, and everyone thinks of ways to manage the family together. For example, Gao He calculated that the village's burden last year (fruits of struggle and mobilization of donations) was 1.75 million yuan, equivalent to 400 dan of rice (calculated at the then rice price). With a total of 1,186 people in the village, each person averaged 3 dou and 3.8 sheng, exceeding the public grain (250 dan) by 150 dan, which greatly surprised the cadres and the masses. Only then did they realize that financial consolidation is for everyone and also for themselves. Therefore, under the slogan of "Overthrow the eternal debt, plant a money tree," the cadres and the masses acted quickly and consciously. Su Dian and Zhen Zhang also used accounting methods to carry out the movement. (2) Using commendation and rewarding methods, dispel the ideological concerns of cadres and open up the movement. In the development of the movement, it is also common to encounter ideological concerns such as fear of accounting and anti-corruption, fear of offending people, fear of struggle, fear of embarrassment, fear of dismissal, and fear of punishment when procedures are not revealed. This requires guaranteeing to cadres and the masses: self-reporting will be rewarded, not punished, calling on cadres to let go of burdens and make contributions to the people, and the masses to strive to be models. After understanding the thinking, organize cadre heroes and activists to take the lead in self-reporting to induce a mass self-reporting movement, and timely rewards and timely commendation should be grasped to enable the movement to develop rapidly and vigorously. For example, after Su Dian labor hero Bi Eryun self-reported that he had 3 dan of wheat at home, and the finance and grain director reported that the community had 6 dan of wheat, it influenced the masses to start self-reporting. When Gao He saw the old man Wang Yichang self-reported 19 iron incense burners and six copper statues weighing 150-160 jin, under the encouragement of slogans such as "Self-reporting is rewarded, self-reporting is glorious," a mass self-reporting movement was formed throughout the village. (3) Financial consolidation must be closely integrated with anti-superstition education. A liberated peasant in Jia Zhang said wonderfully: "We have never benefited from the gods. We didn't eat or drink when there were temples before. Now that the temples are no longer popular, we have turned ourselves over." Other villages are also carrying out financial consolidation movements by breaking superstition. (4) It is necessary to break the parochial thinking of establishing separate households. During the financial consolidation, there is widespread selfish thinking of each village and sub-village, community and community, street and street, planning for themselves. It is difficult to start the movement without breaking through this point. Several small communities in Su Dian village have some things, but at the beginning, they are unwilling to take them out first. "What if we don't take it out and consolidate the expenses? Is it okay to统筹统支 all the expenses of the village?" After several discussions, everyone understood. Gao He's experience in breaking down parochialism is to break through one point and influence the general, that is, first mobilize an old woman to self-report that she has 19 mourning clothes from the filial piety association to promote mass self-reporting. A meticulous organizational work on the issue of combining work, experience has proven that if you don’t pay enough attention, you will lose sight of one thing and lose sight of the other. In places where work is well combined, the achievements are great and there are many creations. For example, the practices of Gao He and Su Dian are to enlighten and collect opinions on financial consolidation during the rectification of mutual aid, and the mutual aid teams discuss financial consolidation while working in the fields. In short, a good combination of the two can achieve both without error; on the contrary, some villages rectified mutual aid without combining finance, while Yuanjia Village only grabbed a handful of financial consolidation, disrupting the rectification of mutual aid. Financial consolidation work is closely integrated with production and construction undertakings. All trees and houses related to production and construction should be protected. Some good temples and houses are demolished, and all trees, large and small, are cut down, which violates the principles of financial consolidation and is also unsatisfactory to the masses. Attention should be paid to: (1) All mature trees or old trees without development can be auctioned and invested in production; while thriving growing trees and old trees with archaeological and scenic value should not only not be cut down, but should also be protected. (2) The demolition of temples and houses refers to those that are burned down, collapsed, difficult to repair, or useless. Temples and residences that can be inhabited should be retained and kept for use as schools, village offices, and village public utilities, or sold to the masses for housing. Do not demolish them at will. (Sheng Xiu, Guo Xing, Ren Bin, Zhen Hua, Xiao Guang, Qing Wu, Lin Nan)

    结合整顿互助组
    启发清理村公产
    长治二区整财取得经验
    【本报长治讯】二区整理财政是在八月八日区村干部会议上提出，以当前整顿互助为中心，结合进行，在二十天当中做出相当大的成绩。据三十三个村（全区三十六个村）的统计，已整出价值约一千九百九十万元的资财，大部村已投资生产，其中苏店、高河、针漳三村下手早，抓的紧，成绩最大，苏店整出二百二十万元，以一部投资铁木工厂，一个月赚洋二十万元，给村经费自给打下了基础。高河整出一百五十多万元，当即建立油房，并设计染房。针漳整出七十万元，依据条件（临汽路）正设计开一修车铺。总之，在整财中已开始摸索到了生产自给的正确道路，并创造不少经验，给进一步开展整财运动安置下良好的基础。就在这个基础上，经本月八、九两日的区村干部会议，展开了以种麦为中心的全面性的整财运动。几种思想问题的初步解决：（一）从算帐入手，启发干部群众认识财政困难与整财重要。运动一开始，往往较普遍的遇见没啥整，整也不顶事等的消极抵抗思想，这就需要耐心的用算帐方法，从算开支、算负担、算家当中间使干部群众认识困难，大家当家大家想办法。例如高河，计算出去年村社负担（斗争果实及动员募捐）一百七十五万元，折米四百石（以当时米价折合），以全村一千一百八十六人计，每人平均合三斗三升八，超过公粮（二百五十石）一百五十石，使干部群众大吃一惊，这才明确整财是为大家，也是为自己。遂在“推倒万年债，栽棵摇钱树”的口号下，干部群众迅速而自觉的行动起来。苏店、针漳也都是运用了算帐办法开展了运动。（二）用表功表模与奖励方法，解除了干部思想顾虑，打开了运动。运动开展中，也往往较普遍的遇见怕算帐反贪污，怕惹人，以及手续不消说出来怕斗争、怕丢人、怕撤职、怕受处分等的思想顾虑，这就需要向干部群众保证：自报得奖，不受处分，号召干部放包袱，为民立功，群众争模范。搞通思想之后，以便组织干部英雄积极分子带头自报，来诱发群众性的自报运动，并应掌握及时奖励，及时表扬，更能使运动迅速而猛烈的开展。如苏店劳英毕二云自报家存麦三石，及财粮主任报出社麦六石之后，就影响的群众自报开了。高河在见老汉王义昌自报十九个铁香炉及一百五六十斤重的六个铜老爷时，“自报得奖，自报光荣”等口号的广播鼓舞之下，遂形成了全村群众性的自报运动。（三）整理财政必须与反迷信教育密切结合。贾掌翻身农民说的妙：“咱没沾过神的光，先前有庙咱也没吃喝，不兴庙了咱倒翻转了身”。别的村子也都是在破除迷信中开展整财运动。（四）必须打破各立门户的本位思想。整财中主村与副村之间，社与社之间，街与街之间，普遍存在着各自打算本位自私思想，突不破这一点，就很难运动开。苏店全村几个小社都有些东西，但起头都不肯首先拿出来，“不拿不整开支怎办？全村一切开支统筹统支好不好？”在大家好几次的讨论之后，才弄通了。高河在打破本位方面的经验，是突破一点影响一般，即先动员了一个老太婆自报家有孝衣会的孝衣十九件，推动群众自报。工作结合问题的一个细致的组织工作，经验证明，稍微注意的不够，就会顾此失彼。凡是工作结合好的地方，成绩大，创造多。如高河苏店的做法，都是在整顿互助过程中同时也启迪与搜集关于整理财政的意见，互助组上地里一边干活一边圪扯整财的事。总之，两者结合的好，才做到两不误；与此相反，有些村整顿了互助，未能结合财政，原家庄则只是抓了一把整财，紊乱了整顿互助。整财工作是与生产建设事业密切结合的，凡有关生产建设之树木房屋等，均应加以保护，有的将好庙宇房舍拆掉，大小树木齐伐，这就违反整财原则，又为群众所不满意，应提出注意：（一）凡成材大树或无发展之老树均可拍卖，投资生产；而正在欣欣向荣的生长树，及有考古和风景价值的老树不仅不应伐，且应加以保护。（二）庙宇房屋之拆毁，是指烧坏倒塌不易修补或毫无用处者，能居住庙宇居舍均应存留保管，以作学校村公所及村公共事业之场所，或作价卖给群众住，不可随意拆毁。（生秀、果行、任斌、振华、晓光、庆五、林南）
