Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 25th: Farmers in the Jiang-controlled areas of Shanxi, unable to bear Yan Xishan's brutal rule, are revolting and collectively fleeing to the liberated areas. On August 4th, Guo Yong, the town head of Huarongtou Town near Taiyuan and a henchman of the Yan bandits, convened a meeting of the town's people to relentlessly demand grain. He pointed menacingly at a pistol, a package of poison, and several wooden sticks on the table, saying, "Do you want to die once, twice, or three times? Dying once is being shot, dying twice is being beaten to death with sticks, and dying three times is taking poison. If you don't hand over the grain, choose one of these three paths!" He ordered Wuke Village to hand over nine shi of rice and Xiaota Village to hand over thirteen shi of rice, to be delivered within three days. The masses remained silent. The town head immediately arrested more than ten people as hostages and killed one person. The people of Xiaota Village searched the entire village overnight, finding only two shi of rice to redeem the hostages. They then held an emergency meeting and resolved "not to wait for death." The entire village of forty-five families moved overnight, helping the old and carrying the young, and fled to the liberated area. Upon hearing the news, the people of Wuke Village also revolted and moved to the promised land. The democratic government of the liberated area warmly welcomed them and immediately allocated houses, land, and food, allowing them to live and work in peace. This is the third and fourth group of masses revolting near Taiyuan since July; the first and second groups were the masses from Baiyaitou Village and Quanshui Village. The revolting masses have now voluntarily established armed forces and organized home-guard teams to fight alongside the revolting armed forces of Baiyaitou.

    小塔村群众集体投奔解放区
    【新华社晋绥二十五日电】山西蒋区农民不堪阎锡山残暴统治，纷纷起义，集体投奔解放区。八月四日太原附近化容头镇阎匪镇长郭永共召集该镇人民开会，勤索粮食，杀气腾腾的指着棹上的一支手枪，一包毒药和几根木棍说：“你们要一下死还是两下死三下死？一下死是枪毙，两下死是乱棒打死，三下死是服毒，你们不交粮就在这三路上选一条吧！”他指定屋科村交米九石，小塔村交米十三石，限三天交齐。群众沉默不语，该镇长当场逮捕十余人作为人质，并杀害一人。小塔村群众连夜搜尽全村存米二石，赎回人质，继乃紧急集会决议“不要等死”，全村四十五家人连夜大搬家，扶老携幼投奔解放区。屋科村群众闻讯亦同时起义，迁入乐土。解放区民主政府予以热烈欢迎，立即配给房屋，田地和口粮，使其安居乐业。此为七月以来太原附近群众已第三及第四批起义，其第一、二批为白崖头村及泉水村群众。现起义群众均已自动建立武装，组织保家队，与白崖头之起义武装并肩战斗。
