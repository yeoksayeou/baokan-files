　　Watermelon Brothers
    Xie Qing
    When a reporter followed the army and passed through Li Lou Village in Huaiyang County, he heard a story about watermelons circulating among the masses. There were two Li brothers who grew watermelons every year, each cultivating about an acre of good watermelons. They were the only ones growing watermelons within a dozen or twenty *li* around, so everyone called them "Watermelon Brothers." The elder brother's watermelon field was located on the east side of the village, along the main road, while the younger brother's watermelon field was on the southwest side of the village, along a small path. Although there was a lot of rain this year, their watermelon fields were on higher ground, so the watermelons still grew big and sweet.

    When the watermelons were just ripe, a team of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit security forces passed through the east side of the village. Those hungry wolves, upon seeing the elder brother's watermelons, immediately started snatching and grabbing. Before long, the more than one *mu* of watermelons was completely gone, leaving only a patch of trampled melon vines and leaves, along with leftover melon rinds and seeds in the field.

    Twenty days after the Chiang Kai-shek bandits passed, the Eighth Route Army suddenly arrived in the village. Coincidentally, this time the Eighth Route Army passed by the younger brother's watermelon field on the southwest side of the village. "My watermelon field is done for," the younger brother thought. "I don't even want my life anymore. I'll just lie in the watermelon field and watch the Eighth Route Army pick my watermelons." The younger brother sat down, disheartened, under the watermelon shed, watching the Eighth Route Army approach. Who knew how many soldiers there were? He couldn't see the end of the line to the north.

    "These watermelons are growing well!" said one of the leading soldiers.
    "There are even *sanbai* watermelons."
    "Each of these melons must weigh thirty *jin*."
    "Eating two of them would quench your thirst."

    The passing soldiers continued to praise the watermelons one after another.

    Hearing the two words "watermelon," the younger brother's heart ached like it was being stabbed with a knife, but he was surprised that these people just talked about it and didn't even stop walking, heading south with all their might. The younger brother looked to both sides and couldn't see the head of the line to the south, nor the tail of the line to the north. He said to himself, "This Eighth Route Army is strange!" Then he stood up, picked up his melon knife, ran to the field, picked up a big watermelon, placed it by the roadside, and quickly cut it open.

    "Eat watermelon, brothers!" the younger brother called out to the Eighth Route Army, but no one answered him.

    "You must be thirsty from walking, come and eat a slice of melon," the younger brother called out to some other soldiers, but the answer was always, "Thank you, folks, we won't eat."

    The younger brother got anxious and shouted loudly:

    "Look at you Eighth Route Army, I've already cut the melon open, why aren't you eating it!"

    At this moment, a young bugler of sixteen or seventeen years old asked him:

    "Folks, how much does your watermelon cost per *jin*?"

    "It's free, eat as much as you want," the younger brother said as he picked up a melon and sent it in front of the young bugler. The young bugler kept saying, "I won't eat, I won't eat," and kept walking forward. The younger brother stood blankly on the edge of the watermelon field, holding the melon. The column continued to move shoulder to shoulder to the south, with no end in sight.

    Note: *Sanbai* watermelons: that is, white skin, white flesh, and white seeds.

　　西瓜兄弟

    记者随军路过淮阳县李楼村时，听到群众间流传着西瓜的故事，当地有李姓西瓜兄弟两人，见年每人种亩把好西瓜，这方圆一、二十里地内也只有他们兄弟俩种西瓜，因此大家就叫他们做“西瓜兄弟”。西瓜老大的地在村东大路边上，西瓜老二的地在村西南小路边上。今年虽然雨水多，可是他们的瓜地高，西瓜还是长得又大又甜。
    瓜刚熟的时候，村东走过了一队蒋匪保安团，那些饿狼们一看见老大的西瓜，顿时你抢我夺的，不一会一亩多地西瓜就一个也不剩了，地里只留下一片踩烂的瓜藤瓜叶与吃剩的瓜皮瓜子。
    蒋匪过去了二十天后，村里忽然来了八路军，巧的是这回八路军从村西南西瓜老二的瓜地边过。“我这瓜地也完了”，西瓜老二想：“我这命也不要啦，我就躺在瓜地里看他八路军摘我的瓜吧”。西瓜老二灰心丧气的往西瓜棚底下一坐，看着八路军过来。谁知道队伍有多少呢，往北看不见尾。
    “这西瓜长得好呀！”领头的一个兵说。
    “还有三白瓜哩。”
    “这瓜一个怕有三十斤。”
    “吃上两个才解渴呢。”
    路过的兵你一句我一句的接着赞叹不置。
    一听见谈西瓜两个字，西瓜老二的心就痛得象刀扎，但他却奇怪这些人说说就完啦，连脚都不停，一股劲往南去。西瓜老二把头偏两边一看，南边已看不见队伍的头，北边还不见队伍的尾。他自言自语的说：“这八路军就是怪呀！”说着就站起来，提着瓜刀跑到地里抱起一个大西瓜往路边一放，剌剌的就切开了。
    “吃西瓜，弟兄们。”西瓜老二向八路军叫，但却没有人答应他。
    “走路渴啦，来吃块瓜。”西瓜老二又向另外一些兵士叫着，但回答都是“谢谢你，老乡，俺不吃。”
    这一下西瓜老二可急了，大声嚷起来：
    “看你们八路军，把瓜切开了，怎的不吃呀！”
    这时有个十六七岁的小司号员向他问：
    “老乡，你这西瓜多少钱一斤？”
    “不要钱随便吃吧。”西瓜老二边说边拿起瓜往小司号员跟前送，小司号员连说：“俺不吃，俺不吃。”脚不停的就朝前走了。西瓜老二捧着瓜直楞楞的在西瓜地边站着，队伍还是肩并肩的往南走，前不见头后不见尾。
    注：三白瓜：即白皮白瓤白子
