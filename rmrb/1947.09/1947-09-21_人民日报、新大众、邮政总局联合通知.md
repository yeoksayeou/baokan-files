Joint Notice from People's Daily, New Masses, and Directorate General of Posts

To all levels of post offices, local offices, and fellow correspondents:

In order to encourage writing and facilitate communication, it has been decided that starting from October 1st, all manuscripts sent to People's Daily and New Masses only need to have the word "Manuscript" marked on the envelope and have the upper left corner of the envelope cut open. They can then be submitted to post offices everywhere without postage stamps. The outstanding postage will be settled uniformly by the newspaper and New Masses with the post office (manuscripts sent through military post offices are free of charge). If the item sent is not a manuscript, it will be handled as unpaid postage upon discovery, and the fee will be doubled.

However, the postage for printed materials such as small newspapers sent from various places is still to be paid by the sender and is not covered by this arrangement. Please take note.

People's Daily, New Masses, and Directorate General of Posts, September 13th

    但各地所寄小报等印刷品之邮资仍旧自付，不在此例，希注意。
