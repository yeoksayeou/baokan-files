Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 7th: Two hundred and five young men from the Jizhen District of Suide have been formed into a team and poured into the main force of the People's Liberation Army. Among them, 23-year-old Ma Yaozu is a descendant of revolutionary martyrs in northern Shaanxi. During the civil war ten years ago, his second uncle, Ma Jibin, was the vice chairman of the Suide County Soviet. Later, he was shot by Chiang Kai-shek's running dogs on the side of the road in Jizhen. His father was forced to death in a cellar by Chiang Kai-shek's special agents. His third uncle, Ma Jichang, was also poisoned to death by special agents at the Suide Normal School. His mother only had him as a single son, but he vowed to avenge his father and uncles. Liu Junjie had personally witnessed the atrocities of the Chiang Kai-shek army when he delivered military grain. He said indignantly: "The women in Yangjia Yuanzi in Wayaobao were ravaged beyond recognition, the grain was looted, the cattle, sheep, and pigs were all slaughtered, and the pots, basins, jars, and bowls were all smashed to pieces. If the enemy attacks, we will definitely suffer this crime too." Ma Zongrong is the director of the township government. He told reporters: "This spring, I settled accounts with the landlords and got my land back. In the past, I only had seven *qing* of bad land, and my family of five was hungry and didn't have enough to eat every year. Now I will never let Hu Zongnan ruin it." The most touching thing is Ma Lianglin. When he signed up for the army, he was rejected many times because he was too young, but he refused to give up. The township government was unable to resist his persistence and finally approved it. He opened his practice book and gave it to the reporter to see, which contained several lines of unevenly written characters: "The first task is to recover Yan'an, the second is to wipe out Hu's sons (referring to Hu's army), and the third is to capture Chiang Kai-shek alive and hold a public trial to let the people vent their anger."
Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 7th: The emancipated farmers in central Hebei are enthusiastically joining the army. In Raoyang County, more than a thousand young people have flocked to the front lines. In Qingyuan, during the review process, 260 young people signed up to join the army in five days. After Cao Jiangchun and four other young people from Yudi Village in Gaoyang joined the army hand in hand, Dong Yangzao's 70-year-old mother said to him: "This year, after the review, I was emancipated in the poor peasant group. I heard that your brother Jiangchun has joined the army. Go ahead and come back after defeating Old Chiang. Otherwise, you will be letting me down." In Zhang'er Village, Ankou Township, under the leadership of the militia instructor, twenty-one emancipated farmers signed up to join the army at the same time. Last year, Liu Xiaofei from Liujia Village signed up and left. His older brother and younger brother heard about it and rushed to sign up.

　　陕北冀中等地农民
  　竞相参加解放军
    【新华社西北七日电】绥德吉镇区二百零五名参军青年，已编队涌入解放军主力。他们中二十三岁的马耀祖是陕北革命先烈的后代，在十年前的国内战争时期，他的二叔父马吉斌是绥德县苏维埃副主席，后来被蒋介石的走狗枪毙在吉镇路旁；父亲被蒋介石特务逼死在地窖里；三叔父马吉昌也被特务用毒药害死在绥德师范；他母亲仅有他一个独子，但他发誓要为父叔们报仇。刘俊杰送军粮时曾经亲眼见过蒋军的暴行。他愤慨地说：“瓦窑堡杨家园子的婆姨被糟踏得不象样，粮食被抢走，牛、羊、猪统给杀光，锅、盆、缸、碗都被打得稀烂；要让敌人打来，咱一定也要受这罪。”马宗荣是乡政府的主任，他告诉记者：“今春上向老财算回了土地，从前我只有七垧坏地，一家五口人年年挨饿不够吃，如今我决不能让胡宗南来糟踏。”最使人感动的是马良麟，当他报名参军时，因年小，曾被多次拒绝，但他不肯甘休，乡政府被他缠不过终于批准了。他打开习字簿送给记者看，里面写着几行字体不匀的字：“头条任务是收复延安，二条要把胡儿子（指胡军）消灭完；三条是活捉蒋介石，开个公审大会叫老百姓出气。”
    【新华社晋察冀七日电】冀中各地翻身农民热烈参军。铙阳一县拥上前线的青年已达千余人。在复查中的清苑五天中即有二百六十名青年报名入伍。高阳于堤村曹江春等五青年携手入伍后，董杨早的七十多岁的母亲对他说：“今年复查，我在贫农小组翻身了，听说你江春哥参军了，去吧，打完老蒋再回来。要不，你就对不起俺。”安口城关区张二村在民兵指导员带领下，二十一个翻身农民同时报名参军。刘家庄去年刘小飞报名去了，他哥哥和弟弟听说都赶去报了名。
