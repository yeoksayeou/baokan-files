Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 4th – The rise of the independence and democracy movements of the Far Eastern people has caused panic, anxiety and rushed measures among the U.S. imperialists. According to a Washington correspondent of the Associated Press on August 31st, “Washington officials believe that the next four months will be the most important period in history concerning Far Eastern affairs.” It also pointed out that "the decisions taken by the United States during this period will shape the permanent trend of the United States' affairs in the region. Japan, Korea, and China will all become countries of concern in this historically turbulent period. Indonesia, Vietnam, and India will also receive the same attention." The U.S. imperialists, shocked by the emergence of this situation, are trying to stop and undermine it. According to the correspondent, regarding the Japan issue, the United States is preparing to unilaterally convene a meeting to preliminarily discuss the Japanese peace treaty. In the event that the Soviet Union insists on its principle of the four powers reaching an agreement first, the United States "will hold the meeting remotely, regardless of the Soviet Union." This is because the United States, in view of the "current urgent situation," "intends to transfer the initial procedures for Japan's future." This means that the United States' measures to support the reactionary forces in Japan can be legalized. Regarding the Korean issue, the United States has decided to abandon the Moscow Conference agreement to reach a consensus with the Soviet Union, and is preparing to submit it to the United Nations. The current suggestion to convene a four-power meeting to discuss the issue "is only another step towards the United Nations." This is because the United States is deeply afraid that if a consensus agreement is reached between the United States and the Soviet Union in accordance with the decision of the Moscow Conference to implement truly democratic elections in Korea in order to establish a unified provisional democratic government, the democratic forces in Korea will inevitably gain a definite victory. Regarding the China issue, U.S. imperialism will provide various forms of assistance to save the precarious fate of the Chiang government. The correspondent said that the Chiang government "will receive a response regarding its request for increased U.S. assistance within the next eight weeks. The Wedemeyer Mission is expected to return to Washington in mid-September, and well-informed sources unanimously believe that "the United States' policy toward China (meaning strengthening the policy of assisting Chiang in the civil war) will definitely be revised in October."
    Regarding the Indonesian issue, the United States is very dissatisfied that Indonesia has seen through its conspiracy and rejected its separate "mediation." Diplomatic circles and government officials in Washington stated that the United States has "turned to seek to strengthen the position of Western countries (meaning the Netherlands)." This extremely evil approach by U.S. imperialism will inevitably arouse a broad anti-American wave among the people in the East. It will not only fail to reverse the desperate situation, but will also suffer the consequences of its own actions.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 4th – Seoul News: Wedemeyer, who conducted an eight-day "investigation" in Korea, flew back to Tokyo on the 3rd. During his stay in Korea, Wedemeyer actively engaged in conspiratorial activities to organize a puppet government in South Korea, attempting to seize important ports in Korea as an expansion base for the United States. According to a Seoul dispatch from the U.S. Information Service on the 1st, Wedemeyer telegraphed Busan on the 31st to inspect port facilities in three groups, and discussed various political and economic issues with 150 Korean reactionaries in the area. This type of "investigation" work was also carried out in and around Seoul. Wedemeyer will leave Tokyo for Hawaii and return to the United States in the coming days.

　　远东人民独立民主运动高涨
  　美反动派惶恐焦虑
    加紧扶植日鲜蒋等反动势力
  　势将激起更广泛的反美浪潮
    【新华社陕北四日电】远东人民独立民主运动的高涨，已引起美帝国主义者的惶恐焦虑与临急周章。据合众社华盛顿记者八月三十一日报导称：“华府官员咸认为今后四个月将成为历史上有关远东事务之最重要时期。”并指出“该时期内美国所采取之决定，将形成美国对该地区事务之永久趋向。日本朝鲜及中国均将成为此富有历史性动荡中众所注意之国家。印尼、越南及印度亦将受同样注意。”美帝国主义者震慑于此种局势之出现，力图加以阻止及破坏。据该记者透露：对日本问题，美国准备片面召开会议初步讨论日本和约，在苏联坚持其四强先行协议的原则的情况下，美国“将不顾苏联而遥目举行会议。”此为美国鉴于“目前时局迫急”，“意图转受日本国内前途之初步程序。”意即美国使扶植日本反动势力的措施，得以合法化。对朝鲜问题，美国已决定抛弃与苏联获得一致协议之莫斯科会议协定，准备把它提交联合国。而目前建议召开四强会议讨论该问题，“实仅趋向联合国之另一步骤。”这是因为美国深恐如果按照莫斯科会议决定，美苏求得一致协议在朝鲜实行真正民主选举，以建立统一的临时民主政府，使朝鲜民主势力必将获得确定之胜利。对中国问题，美帝国主义为挽救蒋政府之垂危命运，将予以各种援助。该记者称：蒋政府“于今后八周内将获得关于其请求美国增加援助之答复，魏德迈考察团料将于九月中旬返华府，消息灵通人士一致认为“十月间美国对华政策（意即加强援蒋内战政策）定将有所修改”。
    关于印尼问题，美国对于印尼洞烛其阴谋而拒绝其单独“斡旋”一点大表不满，华府外交界人士及政府官员表示美国已“转而企求加强西方国家（意指荷兰）之地位”。美帝国主义此种穷凶极恶的作法，势将激起在东方人广泛的反美浪潮，它不仅不能挽既倒之狂澜，且将自食其恶果。
    【新华社陕北四日电】汉城讯：魏德迈在朝鲜作八天之“调查”，已于三日飞返东京。在逗留朝鲜期间，魏德迈积极从事组织南鲜傀儡政府之阴谋活动，图霸占朝鲜之重要港口，作为美国之扩张基地。据美新闻处汉城一日电泄露：魏德迈于三十一日电往釜山分三组视察港口设备，并与该地一百五十名朝鲜反动分子商磋有关政治、经济的各项问题，此种“调查”工作在汉城城内及四周地区也同样进行。魏氏日内即离东京飞夏威夷返美。
