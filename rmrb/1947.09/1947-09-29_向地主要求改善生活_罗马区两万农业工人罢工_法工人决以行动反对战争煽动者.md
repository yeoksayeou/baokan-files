Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, September 25th: Rome—Approximately 25,000 agricultural workers in the Roman region declared a strike on the 22nd. On the 21st, the workers symbolically occupied the landlords' farms in the area. Red flags flew over the farms as the workers angrily demanded that the landlords increase wages and improve working conditions, following the victorious outcome achieved by a million workers in northern Italy on the 19th (increased wages, reduced working hours—six to seven hours in winter and eight hours in summer—family allowances, and temporary subsidies to cope with rising prices).

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, September 21st: Moscow—The Executive Committee of the Italian General Confederation of Labor, taking advantage of the visit of the Italian trade union delegation to the Soviet Union, sent a letter to the Central Committee of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions of the USSR, stating: “We represent all the working people of Italy, studying the restoration work and achievements you have carried out in the areas destroyed by the Nazis, and drawing possible lessons. In Italy, some are now attempting to revive fascism in a new form, but the Italian people are now able to protect and expand their democratic freedoms, protect peace, and strengthen friendship with all free people in the world, especially the great Soviet people. The Italian General Confederation of Labor currently has seven million members and is growing rapidly. We have strong confidence in our future.”

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, September 24th: TASS, Moscow, September 20th—The delegation from the French General Confederation of Labor, which participated in the third session of the Franco-Soviet Trade Union Committee, has returned to Paris by plane. On the eve of their departure, the French delegation gathered with representatives of the Soviet Trade Unions to bid farewell. The Deputy Secretary-General of the French General Confederation of Labor, Frachon, delivered a speech, emphasizing the common interests of French and Soviet workers in the struggle for peace. He said: The French reactionaries and monopoly capitalists link their anti-labor activities with attacks and slander against the Soviet Union. They are also carrying out instigation of a new war under the pressure and support of foreign reactionaries. The French General Confederation of Labor must and will act in accordance with the resolutions of the third session of the Franco-Soviet Trade Union Committee to oppose the instigators of a new war. The Secretary of the French General Confederation of Labor, Sainan, after recounting the cooperation between the French and Soviet trade unions in the World Federation of Trade Unions, said: Each visit to the Soviet Union makes me more convinced that we workers in capitalist countries must understand and love the Soviet Union, and defend this country that is fighting for world peace and democracy. The Secretary of the Central Committee of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions of the USSR, Solovyov, assured the French representatives that the Soviet workers would thoroughly implement the decisions to consolidate and further strengthen the ties between the workers' organizations of the two countries.

    罗马区两万农业工人罢工
    法工人决以行动反对战争煽动者
    【新华社陕北二十五日电】罗马讯：罗马区约近两万五千农业工人二十二日宣布罢工。二十一日，工人曾将该区之地主农场作象征的占领，一时农场上空红旗飘扬，工人愤怒地向地主们要求按照意国北部百万工人十九日所获得的胜利结果（提高工资，减少工时，冬季为六至七小时，夏季八小时，给予家庭津贴及应付物价高涨的临时补助费等），增加工资与改良劳动环境。
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】莫斯科讯：意大利总工会执委会趁意工会代表团访苏之际，致书苏联职工会中央委员会，略称：“我们代表意大利全体劳动人民，研究你们为纳粹摧毁之区域中所进行的恢复工作及成就，吸取可能的教训。意大利现在又有人试图以新形式恢复法西斯主义，但意大利人民现在能够保护并扩大其民主自由，保护和平，加强与世界一切自由人民，特别是伟大苏联人民的友谊。意总工会现拥有七百万会员，并在迅速增长中。我们对我们的前途具有坚强的信心。”
    【新华社陕北二十四日电】塔斯社莫斯科二十日讯：参加法苏职委会三届会议的法国总工会代表团，已乘机返巴黎。在离别前夕，法代表团曾与苏联职工会代表们聚会作别。法总工会副总书记佛拉商即席演说，强调法苏工人在争取和平的奋斗中利益的一致性。他说：法国反动派与垄断资本把他们反劳工的活动，与对苏联的攻击和诽谤连在一起。他们并在外国反动派压力与支持下进行煽动新战争，法总工会必须而且一定按照法苏职委会三届会议的决议，而行动起来，反对新战争的煽动者。法总工会书记赛南讲述法苏职工会在世界职工联盟中的合作后说：每次访苏都使我越发坚信，我们资本主义国家的工人必须明了、热爱苏联，保卫这个为了全世界和平与民主而奋斗的国家。苏职工会中央委员会书记索落维埃夫向法国代表们保证，苏联工会将彻底实行决定，巩固及进一步加强团结两国工人团体间联系。
