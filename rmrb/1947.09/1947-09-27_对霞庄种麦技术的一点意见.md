    A Few Suggestions Regarding Xia Zhuang's Wheat Planting Techniques
    Changzhi Agricultural and Forestry Bureau
    The People's Daily published news about Xia Zhuang's research on wheat planting techniques on September 5th. The entire report fully demonstrates the farmers' enthusiasm for technical research, and many of the specific methods are based on practical labor experience, which can have a great impact on farmers throughout the region. However, there are still a few points that need to be further studied:

    1. The claim that using three catties of sesame oil per mu to coat seeds is equivalent to twenty-five loads of manure lacks scientific basis. The fertilizer content in three catties of oil is very small, and it is unknown how many times less it is compared to twenty-five loads of manure. Moreover, oil decomposes very slowly in the soil, even slower than ordinary base fertilizer. Its strength is weak, and its effectiveness is slow. Using oil as fertilizer is uneconomical, and it attracts pests when applied to the soil (except for asphalt), making it even less worthwhile.

    2. The claim that using eight sheng of black beans as fertilizer has a significant effect also needs further research in terms of quantity. The effectiveness of beans in the soil is the same as that of bean cakes. If a mu of land requires ten or so pieces of oil cake, it would need seventy or eighty catties of beans. Beans contain a little more oil than oil cake, but oil content doesn't play a major role in the soil.

    For several years, many people have promoted the use of oil in the soil, but no one has been able to provide factual proof of its effectiveness. Oil is a good thing, and people need to eat oil, but the soil doesn't need it. If anyone still firmly believes it is a practical experience, it is best to conduct a comparative experiment on a small plot of land.

    The most economical way to use beans in the soil is to open an oil mill to extract oil. The oil extracted from the beans is for human consumption, the bean cake is used to feed pigs, and the pig manure is applied to the land, so that the beans are fully and rationally utilized without waste.

    3. The method of using bowls to measure the ratio of cold and hot water in warm water seed soaking is unreliable and fails to achieve sterilization. Warm water seed soaking is a scientific treatment method, and even experienced experts need a thermometer and timer to control the temperature and time. Our current conditions are not sufficient, so warm water seed soaking should not be promoted. It can be used to promote early germination, but it cannot be used for sterilization and disease prevention.

    4. No matter what seed soaking method is used, it is not absolutely effective in preventing smut and jaundice. This is because the transmission media for these two diseases include not only seeds but also soil, fertilizer, water, farm tools, wind, and other plants. Seed soaking alone is not enough.

    General disease prevention methods should include: (1) Selecting disease-free seeds. (2) Avoiding continuous cropping in areas where diseases have been found. (3) Widening row spacing. (4) Applying more ash and virgin soil. (5) Eliminating wild dwarf cherries (shaped like small hawthorns), which are one of the transmission media for wheat jaundice. (6) Removing smut-infected plants in the field when wheat is heading. (7) Propagating and promoting varieties that are not susceptible to disease. As for seed soaking, it is only one of the methods and cannot be fully relied upon.

    Especially in areas near rivers, such as the banks of the Zhang River, washing wheat in ditches should be prohibited. The banks of the Zhang River are a wheat-producing area in Taihang and also the area with the most serious smut. The main reason is probably washing diseased wheat with ditch water, and then using the wheat-washing water to irrigate wheat fields, which facilitates the spread of the disease.

    对霞庄种麦技术的一点意见
    长治农林局
    人民日报九月五日刊载霞庄研究种麦技术新闻，在整个报导内容上，充分表现农民对技术研究的热情，有许多具体办法，是实际的劳动经验，能给全区农民很大的影响；但是还有几点需要加以研究的：
    一、每亩用大麻油三斤搓种，能顶二十五驮粪，这一点是没有科学根据的。三斤油里所含的肥份是非常少的，与二十五驮粪比较，不知要少多少倍呢？并且油上到地，分解非常慢，比一般的主粪还要慢，力量小生效又慢，用油当肥料是不经济的，并且油上到地里招害虫，（柏油除外）更不合算。
    二、用黑豆八升当粪上地效力很大；这一点在数量上也还要加以研究，豆子上地的效力与豆饼是相同的，如果一亩地用油饼十来块，用豆子也得七八十斤才行，豆子里比油饼多一点油份，油份在地里是不起大作用的。
    关于用油上地，几年来宣传的人很多，但是究竟有多少效力，没有人能拿出事实证明。油是好东西，人需要吃油，但是地土不需要它，如果还有人肯定的相信它是实际经验，最好用小块地作个比较试验看。
    用豆子上地，最经济的办法是开油坊打油，豆子打出油人吃，豆饼喂猪，猪粪上地，就把豆子毫不浪费的全部合理的利用了。
    三、温汤浸种用碗量兑冷水与热水温度是靠不住的，起了不杀菌的作用，温汤浸种是一种科学的处理办法，就是熟练的专家，也需要有温度计与时计，掌握温度与时间。目前我们的条件还不够，温汤浸种可以不提倡。为了促早发芽可以用，为了杀菌防除病害，就没办法用。
    四、不论什么浸种办法，防治乌霉黄疸全不是绝对有效的。因为这两种病的传染媒介除种籽外，还有土壤、肥料、水、农具、风、其他植物，仅只浸种是不够的。
    对病害一般的防除方法要：（一）选用没病的种籽。（二）不在发现过病害的地方种重茬。（三）行距加宽。（四）多上草木灰，开荒土。（五）消灭野生郁李（形同小山楂），它是传染小麦黄疸病的媒介之一。（六）在小麦抽穗时，到田间拔除乌霉株。（七）发现不感染病害的品种加以繁殖推广。至于浸种仅只是方法之一，还不能完全靠它。
    特别是靠近河流的地方，象漳河两岸，应禁止在渠沟淘麦。漳河两岸是太行产麦区，也是乌霉最严重地区，主要原因恐怕是用渠水淘病麦，淘麦水又浇麦地，便利了传染的原因。
