    Suzhong Captures Sheyang Town
    Eliminating Over 400 Chiang Kai-shek Bandits
    Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 28th—After capturing Baiju, an important town on the Tongyu Highway, a certain unit of the Suzhong Liberation Army crossed numerous blockades and penetrated the "encirclement and suppression" zone on the east bank of the Grand Canal. On the 23rd, they captured Sheyang Town, the enemy's "encirclement and suppression" center stronghold east of Baoying, completely annihilating a part of the Kuomintang's reorganized Fourth Division, 268th Regiment, and over 400 local Chiang Kai-shek troops, seizing one mortar, one small cannon, and fifteen light and heavy machine guns. This town is located sixty li east of Baoying City and is the commercial transportation center of Funing, Xinghua, and Baoying counties. The Liberation Army's capture of this stronghold has severely struck the Chiang Kai-shek puppet's "encirclement and suppression" deployment, and the offensive is still expanding.
