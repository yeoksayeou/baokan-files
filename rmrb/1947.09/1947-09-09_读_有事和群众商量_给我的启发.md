Reflections on Reading "Consult with the Masses When Matters Arise"
    Shēn Shū

This article by Comrade Shēn Shū is a reflection on his work experience after reading Comrade Chén Bódá's article "Consult with the Masses When Matters Arise." How exactly to follow the mass line? There are still points worth discussing. We hope everyone will study and offer their opinions.　　　　　　　　　　　　　　——Editor

    I have always worked in government offices, but last year I personally participated in the land reform movement for several months. Looking back today, I see many problems in both my thought processes and work methods during that period. Especially after reading Comrade Chén Bódá's article "Consult with the Masses When Matters Arise," I have a further understanding of those problems.

    When we consult with the masses, distinguishing between the opinions of the masses is still influenced by our original class stand and viewpoints. When I was working in a village, I encountered the following situation: The chairman of the village farmers' association was a poor peasant and very active in his work (especially in leading mass movements); however, his work style was undemocratic, and he gained a lot of personal benefit in the struggle. The village chief was a middle peasant, and he did a decent job in routine matters (requisitions, helping the army, etc.), but he was most afraid of mass struggles, adopted an evasive attitude towards leading mass movements, and did not want any of the spoils of struggle. Regarding the evaluation of these two cadres, all the district cadres who had worked in the village unanimously considered the farmers' association chairman to be good and the village chief to be bad. I initially thought the same way, believing that although the farmers' association chairman had many shortcomings, he was good in essence. And the village chief's fear of mass movements proved that he had reactionary thoughts and was bad in essence. However, later, after I conducted an investigation among the masses (asking some middle peasants), the masses unanimously evaluated them as follows: "The farmers' association chairman handles everything himself, is selfish and wants to get rich. No one dares to say anything, and he will be struggled against sooner or later. The village chief is fair, doesn't love money, and is a good person." This confused me. Why did we think the good one was bad, and the bad one was good? Were the masses right, or were we right?

    This question swirled in my mind for a long time, and I couldn't figure it out. Later, I saw the chapter "The Class Nature of People" in Comrade Shaoqi's "On the Party," which said: "In class society, people's concepts of good and evil are different. What the exploiters consider good, the exploited consider evil; what the exploited consider evil, the exploiters consider good." It also said: "Admitting the nonsense of 'supra-class' and 'supra-partisan'," "being good at fantasy, fearing serious practice and struggle, is a manifestation of the petty-bourgeois essence." So I thought: This is a newly liberated area, and the village I am working in is the most backward village here. The masses have not been fully mobilized, so naturally, their level of awareness is not high. And the masses I investigated belong to the middle peasants. The thoughts and viewpoints of some of them are still influenced by the landlord class. Therefore, the people they consider good are mostly those who seemingly represent "the whole people" but are actually the accomplices of the exploiting classes and peace-makers (the so-called "fair people") who cannot be considered good people.

    Therefore, I made the following assessment of the two cadres: The village chief was a complete peace-maker, and the farmers' association chairman was naturally the "bad person" in the eyes of the exploiters, but a good person who could lead the liberation of the people. Thus, the problem seemed to be solved.

    But later, I talked to some poor peasants, and their evaluation of the village chief and the farmers' association chairman was roughly the same as the information I had previously gathered from the middle peasants. This made me confused again. Could it be that the exploited poor peasants were also influenced by the landlord class? Therefore, my initial assessment of the village chief and the farmers' association chairman (village chief bad, farmers' association chairman good) felt inappropriate again. Since the masses were unanimous in their view, if we were to follow the mass line, we would have to replace the farmers' association chairman. But when the mass movement is flourishing, allowing a peace-maker to lead would obviously be a big mistake. This confused me again. If we listen to the masses and replace the farmers' association chairman, the mass movement will be greatly affected; if we don't replace him, wouldn't we be somewhat detached from the masses? Therefore, this became another problem that I couldn't figure out for a long time. But after reading "Consult with the Masses When Matters Arise," it gave me great enlightenment on this problem.

    "The wisdom of the masses is infinite," and "Only by concentrating the wisdom of the masses is the greatest wisdom." "Things that you can't figure out in your mind can be easily solved and understood once you consult with the masses." (Chén's words) This means that we must firmly believe in the masses, that the masses are all-powerful, and that the wisdom of a few leaders is limited. However, in the aforementioned question of my views on the two village cadres, I did not first go to the masses to investigate and listen to their opinions, but rather prematurely labeled them within the minds of a few district cadres. And when I later investigated among the masses and found that their views were inconsistent with ours, I not only did not let the masses study, discuss, and handle this issue, but still believed that our views and those of a few district cadres were correct, and that the reason why the masses' opinions were inconsistent with ours was because they were "influenced by the exploiting classes" and were ideologically backward.

    This is a failure to understand that the good, bad, merit, demerit, and whether mistakes can be educated regarding cadres, "are usually compared in the minds of the masses." The aforementioned fact that I investigated the masses several times, and their evaluations of the farmers' association chairman and the village chief, whether from middle or poor peasants, were surprisingly consistent and unanimous, is precisely this kind of argument. This is because I still do not have a deep understanding of the truth that "the wisdom of the masses is infinite." However, this kind of problem is common among our cadres. I have encountered many village cadres who are considered good by the leadership but not by the masses. The reason why the leadership considers them good is because these cadres complete tasks quickly, are bold, dare to act, are good at speaking, and are very responsible to the higher levels; while these cadres treat the masses by issuing orders, acting arbitrarily, not allowing the masses to "talk nonsense," and monopolizing the spoils of struggle, and so on. How can this satisfy the masses? In this situation, some of our leading cadres often do not firmly believe in the masses, leaving the problems to the masses to study, discuss, and handle, but instead, they try to find many reasons to prove the correctness of their own views. This certainly does not mean that those good cadres who are thought of by the leaders are actually bad. No, our leaders are generally consistent with the masses, and good cadres are in the majority. Even bad cadres do have many advantages. But the masses are not satisfied with them, and there is a reason for it; because their style is indeed not good for the masses.

    However, in the new areas, such cadres are very common. If we say that since the masses are not satisfied, then we will replace them all, or even give them some punishments. Then the newly elected cadres will have the feeling that "there is no good ending for being a cadre," and therefore they will either be hesitant in their work or show little interest. This is also not conducive to the work. Does this mean that none of these cadres can be replaced? However, what if the masses are not satisfied? The reason why I couldn't figure out this problem was also here. But now I understand: "If we hand over the cadre problem to the masses for criticism, education, and handling, and let the masses make a careful comparison in a collective setting, then it is impossible for personal cover-ups and favoritism to occur, and there will definitely be no burying of talent. It will definitely be handled properly and fairly."

    In this way, cadres can be transformed by the great power of mass education (Chén's words). The key to the problem lies here, but I was not like this. Initially, I did not conduct investigations among the masses, but only went in circles in the minds of a few district cadres and in my own mind. Later, although I conducted investigations among the masses, I did not hand over the problem to the masses for handling, let alone allow the masses to make careful comparisons in a collective setting. No wonder I became more and more confused. In addition, the view that only the farmers' association chairman can lead the mass movement, and that replacing him would affect the mass movement, is also inappropriate. Because, if the farmers' association chairman is really as described above (although there are shortcomings, he is good in essence), then after careful comparison by the masses, his advantages will not be buried; if he has made mistakes but can be educated, then after criticism and education by the masses, he will be transformed, and the masses will still support him as a cadre; if he is uneducable, then we should resolutely replace him, and the masses will be able to re-elect their good cadres.

    Of course, the awareness of the masses varies, and some individuals may inevitably have wrong perceptions of cadres, but in collective discussions by the masses, this wrong perception will be eliminated. We should also admit that the masses may have a certain degree of backward thinking on some issues, but as long as we are good at enlightenment, the level of awareness of the masses will continue to improve and be able to give play to their creativity.

### 读“有事和群众商量”给我的启发

专栏：

　　读“有事和群众商量”给我的启发
    申抒
    这篇文章是申抒同志读了陈伯达同志“有事和群众商量”一文后，连系工作实际的一些认识，究竟怎样走群众路线？尚有值得讨论的地方，希望大家研究后提出意见。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　——编者
    我一向作着机关工作，但在去年却亲身参加了几个月的土改运动。今天回忆起来，在这段工作中，不论在思想方法上，或工作方式上，都有不少毛病。尤其在看了陈伯达同志“有事和群众商量”的文章以后，对那些毛病更有了进一步的认识。
    当我们和群众商量时，辨别群众的意见，也还是会受自己的原来阶级立场和观点所左右的。我在一个村子里工作的时候，曾遇到过这样一件事：该村农会主席是贫农，工作很积极（尤其在领导群运方面更是如此）；但作风不民主，且在斗争中多得了果实。该村村长是中农，对日常事务工作（要差、帮助军队等）作得还可以，但最怕群众斗争，对领导群运采取推诿态度，也不要斗争果实。对这两个干部的认识，凡在那村工作过的区干部，都一致认为农会主席好，村长不好。我起初也是这样认识，认为农会主席虽有很多缺点，但本质上是好的。而村长对群运害怕，就证明他有变天思想，本质上不好。但是我后来在群众中一调查（问了一些中农），群众一致的评价是：“什么事都是农会主席一把抓，自私自利，想发财，谁敢吭气，以后非斗他不可。村长那人到公正，不爱财，是个好人。”这一来可把我弄糊涂了，为什么我们认为好的，而群众认为不好；而我们认为不好的，群众反认为是好的呢？究竟群众对呢，还是我们对？
    这问题在我的脑子里盘旋了好久想不通。后来看到少奇同志“论党”内“人的阶级性”一章，其中说：“在阶级社会中，人们的善恶观念就各有不同，剥削者认为善的，被剥削者认为恶；被剥削者认为恶的，剥削者认为善。”又说：“承认‘超阶级’‘超党派’的胡说”，“长于幻想，畏惧严重的实践与斗争，则是表示小资产阶级的本质。”于是我这样想：这里是新区，我所在的村子又是这里第一等的落后村，群众还完全没有发动过，自然群众的觉悟程度不会高。而我向其调查的群众，又都属于中农。他们中间的一些人的思想与观点，还受着地主阶级的影响。因此他们所认为是好人的，大都是那些表面上似乎是代表“全民”，而实际上则是剥削阶级的帮手的和事老（即所谓“公正人”）算不得好人。
    因此我对那两个干部便作了这样的认识：那个村长是十足的和事老，而那个农会主席自然是剥削者所说的“坏人”而能领导翻身的好人了。这样问题似乎得到解决了。
    可是后来我又找位贫农谈了一下，他们对村长与农主的评价，竟和我以前向中农调查的材料大体相同。这就使我又想不通了，难道被剥削的贫农，也是受了地主阶级的影响吗？因此，我最初对村长与农会主席的那种认识（村长坏、农会主席好）又感到不妥了。既然群众一致是这样的认识，如果要走群众路线的话，就只有将那个农会主席换掉。可是正当群运蓬勃发展的时候，让和事老来领导，又明明是一个大错误。这可又把我弄糊涂了。听群众的话换掉农会主席吧，群运会受大的影响；照旧不换吧，岂不有些脱离群众！？因此，这又成为我一个好久想不通的问题了。但看了“有事和群众商量”以后，则给了我对这个问题的认识以很大的启发。
    “大众的智慧是无限的”，“只有集中大众的智慧才是最大的智慧”。“自己在脑中想不通的东西，一和群众商量，便能迎刃而解，豁然贯通”。（陈语）这就是说，我们要坚决相信群众，群众是万能的，而少数领导者的智慧则是有限的。然而，前述我对那两个村干部的观点问题，不是首先到群众中去调查，听取群众的意见，而是事先就在几个区干部中给它安了一个帽子。而当后来在群众中一调查，发现群众和我们认识不一致时，不仅没有将这问题让群众去研究、讨论、处理，而且仍然认为自己和少数区干部的认识是正确的，至于群众意见和我们不一致，那则是由于他们“受了剥削阶级的影响”，思想落后的结果。
    这就是不了解，干部的好、坏、功、过、以及犯了错误能否教育等，“通常在群众心目中，都是有一个比较的”，前述，我数次向群众调查，他们对农会主席和村长的评价，无论中贫农其意见竟能不约而同，毫无二致，这就是这一种论断的，这就是我对于“群众的智慧是无限的”这一真理还是体会得不深刻。然而这种毛病，在我们干部中是常有的。我就遇到过很多领导上认为好，而群众则认为不好的村干部。领导上所以认为好，是由于这些干部完成任务快，胆大，敢干，能说，对上级很负责等；而这些干部对待群众则是，发号施令，独断专行，不让群众“乱说”，霸占斗争果实等等。这怎能使群众满意呢？在这种情况下，我们有些领导干部，往往不是坚决相信群众，把问题让群众去研究、讨论、处理，反而硬找许多理由来正明自己观点的正确。这当然不是说，领导上所认为的那些好干部，实际上都是坏的，不，我们的领导一般说来还是和群众一致的，好的干部也占多数，即使不好的干部，他们确也还有许多优点。但群众对他们不满，也不是没有根据的；因为他们那种作风，对群众的确也是不好的。
    然而在新区，这样的干部是很普遍的。如果我们说，群众既然不满意，那就把他们通通都换掉，甚至给他们一些处分。那么重选的新干部就会有“当干部没下场”的感觉，因而他们对工作就会不是表现束手束脚，就是表现兴趣不高。这样对工作也是不利的。照这样说，这些干部不是一个也不可以撤换吗？然而群众不满意怎么办？我对这问题想不通的原因也就在这里。但是现在想通了：“把干部问题交给群众去批评，去教育，去处理，让群众在集体的场合加以一番慎审的比较，那末就一定不可能发生个人的包庇，袒护，也一定不会有埋没。也一定能够处理的妥当，能够公平合理。
    这样使干部经过群众教育的大力量，获得改造（陈语），问题的关键就在这里，然而我恰恰不是这样。最初我没有向群众作调查，只是在少数区干部和自己的脑子里兜圈子，后来虽然向群众调查了，但是没有将问题交给群众去处理，更没有让群众在集体的场合加以审慎的比较，这就难怪自己要越想越糊涂了。另外，就是认为只有那个农会主席才能领导群运，将他换掉就会影响群运的观点，也是不妥的。因为，如果那个农会主席，真是象前面所说的（虽有缺点，但本质上好）那样时，那末经过群众审慎的比较，他的好处是不会被埋没的；如果他是犯了错误而又可以教育的话，那末经过群众的批评教育，使他获得改造，群众是会仍旧拥护他当干部的；如果他是不可教育的，那我们就应当将他坚决换掉，群众是能够重新选出他们的好干部来的。
    当然群众的觉悟不同，个别人有时也难免对干部有错误的认识，但在群众集体的讨论中，这种错误认识就会被淘汰。我们也应当承认，群众在某些问题上，也可能有一定程度的落后思想，但只要我们善于进行启发，那群众的觉悟程度，就会不断提高，并能发挥其创造性。（完）
