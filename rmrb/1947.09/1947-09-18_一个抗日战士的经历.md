　　The Experience of an Anti-Japanese Soldier
    Liu Baorong
    Wu Tianyou was a soldier liberated during the Zhengtai Railway Campaign. He talked about his experiences at a speak-bitterness meeting:
    "During the Central Plains War in 1944, I was a platoon leader in the 64th Division of the 15th Army, and I was ordered to defend Luoyang to the death. Our platoon suffered heavy casualties and retreated to the west of Luoyang. I was wounded in three places and captured by the Japanese. I was taken to Shijiazhuang, where my wounds were treated, and then sent to Japan to work in a coal mine in Yamakita. It was a deep-sea coal mine, where people were neither human nor ghost. We drank thin sorghum porridge every day and had to dig four carts of coal (more than 4,000 pounds). Within a month of arriving there, more than a dozen people died in our team of about a hundred.
    "After Japan surrendered, I was overjoyed. I returned to Tianjin and registered at the 'Returning Laborers Office.' I was so happy I couldn't express it. I could finally say I had returned to China, and even if I died, I would be feeding China's dogs. I could even eat a little millet porridge. But after a few days, they stopped taking care of me! I said, 'Then can I still be a soldier?' They said, 'No! The War of Resistance has been won, and the country doesn't need your kind!' Heavens, they couldn't even catch soldiers, so why didn't they want me! It turned out that my left leg was crippled while defending Luoyang! I couldn't be a soldier.
    "I begged them again, saying, 'This injury was sustained fighting the Japanese, so I shed blood for the country. If I can't be a soldier, please find me any kind of job, as long as I don't starve to death.' You can't guess what they said. They said, 'Do you think you've done something meritorious? Who told you to shed blood? Go find him, it's none of our business!' I was furious, and I said, 'The dog told me to shed blood! Old Chiang grabbed me and made me a soldier, wasn't it him who told me to shed it?!' That fellow 'slapped' me in the face and kicked and beat me, saying I was insulting the 'leader.' I said, 'Damn you! What kind of leader! If he remains the leader for two more years, China will be finished! Go ahead and shoot me, I've had enough of living anyway!' That fellow had no choice but to put me in solitary confinement for nine days. In the confinement cell, I didn't eat, and all I did was sleep and curse, I cursed whoever I wanted to curse, leader or no leader! On the fourth day, the dog released me.
    "After getting out of solitary confinement, I decided to go home, begging for food along the way. At that time, I didn't understand the situation in the liberated areas, so I didn't dare go directly to Henan. I detoured to Taiyuan, but who knew that Yan Xishan, that bastard, was so desperate he wanted anyone, even a cripple like me. I had no choice but to undergo a month of training in a training camp and became a soldier. I was liberated by the People's Liberation Army on the Zhengtai Railway.
    "You see (Wu Tianyou pointing to all the PLA officers present), who did I shed blood for in the past? Who did I sweat for? Who did I suffer for? I suffered insults from the Japanese and almost lost my life. When I returned to my own country, I still encountered these hardships! Whose fault is this? Everyone, think back, you fought the Japanese for seven or eight years, what did you get out of it? When I came to the liberated area, I saw that retired soldiers had land, houses, and wives, and were respected. I was heartbroken, my ten years were wasted on dogs. Now I hope that the comrades with good health will all join the People's Liberation Army, become glorious people's soldiers, avenge themselves, and overthrow Chiang the Little!"

　　一个抗日战士的经历
    刘宝荣
    吴天佑是正太路战役解放的战士，在诉苦会上谈了他的经历：
    “三十三年中原战役，我在十五军六十四师当排长，奉命死守洛阳。我们排伤亡很大，退到洛阳西边，我挂了三处彩，被日本人俘虏了，解到石门，医好了伤，送到日本国，在山沟县下煤窑。那是海底煤窑，人不象人鬼不象鬼，一天喝些高粱米稀饭，还得挖四车煤（四千多斤），到那里没有一个月，光我们那个队有一百来人，就死了十几个。
    “日本投降后，我高兴的不得了，回到天津，在‘回国劳工处’报了名，我真喜欢的不能说，可算回到中国了，就是死了，也是喂了中国的狗。小米稀饭也能吃一点了。谁知停了不几天，人家就不管了！我说：‘那我还是当兵吧？’人家说：‘不要！抗战胜利了，国家不要你这块料！’老天，抓兵他们都抓不到，为啥不要我！原来死守洛阳时，我的左腿打残废了！当兵不行。
    我又央告人家说：“我这伤也是打日本时负的，总算是为国家流了血的，当兵不要，请先生随便给我找个差事，饿不死就行。”你们都猜不着人家说的啥，人家说：“难道你还有了功啦？你流血，谁叫你流的？你去找他去，不干我们的事！”我气极了，我说：“狗叫我流的，老蒋他把我抓出来当了兵，还不是他叫我流的？！”那家伙“拍”打了我一耳光，连踢带打说我污辱了“领袖”。我说：“王巴！什么他妈的领袖！他再当二年领袖，中国就要亡了！要枪毙就枪毙吧，反正我也活够了！”那家伙没办法，把我押了九天禁闭，我在禁闭室里给饭也不吃，成天在里面除了睡觉，就是大骂，我愿意骂谁就骂谁，管你领袖不领袖！到第四天头上，狗日的把我放了。
    “出了禁闭室，我就下决心回家，一面要饭，一面往回走。那个时候也不明白解放区的情形，不敢直接往河南走，就绕道太原，谁知阎老西那个王八蛋，着了急什么人他都要，连我这个残废家伙也叫他抓去。没办法，在集训班受了一个月的训，就当了兵，在正太路上叫解放军解放过来。
    “你们看（吴天佑指着在场的所有解放军官），这样我过去为谁流了血？流了汗？受了罪？受日本人的污辱，差点没送了命、回到自己国里，还找到了这些苦！这是谁的罪恶？大家回想一下，你们出来打了七八年日本，哪里得到什么结果？我来到解放区，看到退伍军人有地、有房、有老婆，还受人尊敬，真是伤心透了，咱十来年算是给狗干了。现在我希望身体好的同学们，都参加解放军，当个光荣的人民战士，为自己报仇，打倒蒋二小！”
