　　Finance Office Launches Three Checkups Movement
  　Proactively Cleansing Hidden Landlords
    [Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] According to Director Luo of the Finance Office, the office, in conjunction with the meritorious service campaign, has universally launched a three checkups movement (checking work, checking stance, and checking ideology) in nineteen units of different natures since August, under the condition that work hours cannot be relaxed in the slightest. In terms of their study methods, in addition to carefully reading Comrade Bo Yibo's report on land reform, they have stopped general political and cultural classes, and are specializing in studying land reform, while also closely grasping current affairs studies, keeping comrades' minds clear at all times. Each unit has also sent cadres to participate in land reform work in the villages, trying to find time to participate in mass grievance meetings to listen to the masses expose the landowners' crimes. Local village cadres or emancipated peasants are invited to act as teachers, reporting on the suffering of peasants from exploitation and oppression. When a certain unit was stationed in a certain village, some cadres believed that the struggle in the village was excessive, sympathizing with the landlords, and had dissatisfaction with land reform. When studying land reform, the unit invited village cadres to speak to everyone about the landlords' crimes. When the village cadres talked about the landlords oppressing the peasants, they pointed to a landlord's house and said that in the past, when he oppressed someone, that person's wife went to his field to pick up wheat ears and was kicked in the stomach, causing a miscarriage. The account was detailed, with names, dates, and places. When the cadres heard this, they immediately knew who was being talked about, and said angrily: "So it's that guy, so hateful! He should have been beaten to death long ago, that dog!" The cadres shifted from sympathy for the landlords to hatred for the landlords, enriching the concept of how landlords oppressed peasants when studying documents. Soldiers who had suffered from landlords' oppression and exploitation also recalled the suffering they had endured after hearing the report, awakening their original class feelings and clarifying their class stance. The leadership seized this opportunity and proposed "Poor people all over the world are one family, other people's pain is also one's own pain, talk about others, think about oneself." From then on, the land reform study in this unit was a great success. Director Luo pointed out that the current land reform study movement in the Finance Office is developing enthusiastically. The preliminary achievements are: Cadres clearly realize that each unit is an appointment institution and cannot be a "bomb shelter" for landlords. In the past, when the masses wanted to struggle against certain individuals, individual units were unwilling to hand them over. Now, whatever they ask for, they give it without hesitation. Later, some units felt that this was still passive, and they should proactively investigate feudal landlords and send them back to the local authorities for handling as soon as they were found. Out of one unit of one hundred and thirty-two people, forty-four objects of struggle were found; out of one unit of sixteen persons in charge, eight objects of struggle were found, and two main persons in charge were local despots. For the wages of the objects of struggle who are allowed by the villagers to stay in each unit to work, the masses conducted evaluations and reductions according to the type of work, and a certain amount was taken from their wage income and returned to the village (preferably by himself), to repay the blood and sweat money they exploited from the masses. The working hours of the objects of struggle should not be left to their own discretion (coal mine workers are temporary, and can go to work and leave work at their own convenience), and the number of hours worked each month should be fixed through mass evaluation. The relationship between each unit and the masses is closer. (Yu Ming)

　　财办开展三查运动
  　主动清洗隐蔽地主
    【本报特讯】据财经办事处罗主任谈，该机关结合立功运动，自八月份起十九个不同性质的单位，在工作时间丝毫不能松驰的条件下已普遍展开查工作、查立场、查思想的三查运动。他们学习的方法，除精心阅读薄一波同志关于土地改革的报告外，停止一般的政治课、文化课，专门学习土地改革，同时抓紧时事学习，时时刻刻保持同志们的头脑清醒。各单位并派干部参加驻村土地改革工作，尽量抽时间参加群众诉苦大会，倾听群众揭露地主的罪恶事实。请当地区村干部或翻身农民当先生，报告农民受剥削受压迫的痛苦。某单位驻某村时，有些干部认为该村斗争过火，悯怜地主，对土地改革有不满情绪。学习土地改革时，该单位即请村干部向大家讲地主罪恶，村干部说到地主压迫农民时，指着一所地主的房子说，他过去压迫谁，谁的老婆去他地里拾麦子，被他一脚踢得小产。说的有眉有眼，有名有姓有时间。干部一听，马上便知道说的是谁，愤慨的说：“原来是那个家伙，那么可恶呀！早该打死他狗日的！”干部由悯怜地主的情绪转到对地主憎恨，把学习文件时地主如何压迫农民的概念充实起来。受过地主压迫剥削的战士，听了报告，也回想起自己所受的痛苦，唤醒了原来阶级情感，明确了自己的阶级立场。领导上抓紧这个时机，提出“天下穷人是一家，人家的痛苦也是自己的痛苦，谈人家，想自己”，从此该单位的土地改革学习便轰开了。罗主任指出，目前财办土地改革学习运动正热烈发展，初步成绩是：干部明确认识到各单位是任命机构，不能当地主的“防空洞”。过去群众要斗争对象时，个别单位不愿交出来，现在要那个给那个，毫不犹豫。后来有的单位感到这还是被动，应主动的清查封建地主查出即送回地方处理。一个单位一百三十二人中，查出四十四个斗争对象；一个单位十六个负责人中，查出八个斗争对象，两个主要负责人是恶霸地主。对于经过本村群众允许而留在各单位做工的斗争对象的工资，群众按照类型分别展开评议降低，在其工资收入中抽出一定数目还给本村（最好由他自己去还），以还他剥削群众的血汗钱。斗争对象的工作时间也不应听其自便（煤窑工人是临时的，可以上班下班自便）以及每月所作工数，都通过群众评议固定起来。各单位与群众关系更加密切。（毓明）
