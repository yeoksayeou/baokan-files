  　Mutual Aid in Production and Disaster Preparedness
    [Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 8th] Various counties in Northeastern Jin and Western Hebei are vigorously carrying out drought resistance and disaster preparedness. In Qu Yang, which suffered the most severe drought, rain has fallen successively, and 160,000 mu of barren land in the county have been sown with buckwheat and vegetables. In parts of Xin Tang, Tang County, and Hun Yuan counties, rain has fallen, and more than 5,000 mu of late autumn crops have been rush-planted. In areas where rain has fallen in Wan County, Fu Ping, Wu Tai, and Ling Shou, people are also rushing to plant vegetables and buckwheat. In areas where it has not rained, the government has assigned special personnel to manage all water sources and organize rational use. In Hun Yuan and other counties, irrigation has saved approximately 6,000 mu of land. In Dongshi Nancun Village in Xin Tang, farmers have collectively managed and shared 57 waterwheels obtained from liquidation, organizing work teams to irrigate more than 3,000 mu of autumn fields. The Er Li Tun Village in the county has also formed human and animal-powered work teams, watering the land day and night, and irrigating all 500 mu of the village in July. Bai Cang Village in Yu County, and Bei Yu and Huang Hua Kou villages in Lai Shui, have opened 14 small canals, turning more than 1,300 mu of dry land into irrigated land. The disaster preparedness movement of collecting substitute foods and engaging in sideline livelihoods has also been launched. Yi County has universally established small cooperatives centered on organizing disaster relief, such as weaving, transportation, and cotton ginning. The newly formed transportation team in Jian Ping's Gu Yue Village has earned 16 shi of rice from three transport trips. Women organized in Ping Ding County to make shoes can earn 6,000 yuan per person per day. The Ping Ding County government is actively restoring the coal and iron industry, with 14 coal kilns and 30 iron furnaces already restored, enabling some disaster victims to make a living. Regarding the collection of tree leaves and wild vegetables, Shang Jia Wan Village in Ping Shan alone has accumulated thousands of catties. Personnel of the Ping Shan County government have also collected more than 2,000 catties of tree leaves.
