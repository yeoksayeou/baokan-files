    Marks Large-Scale US Aggression Against South China
    Soong Tzu-wen Appointed Chairman of Guangdong
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 21st] According to news from Nanjing: The Chiang bandit government appointed Soong Tzu-wen as Chairman of the Chiang-controlled Guangdong Provincial Government on the 19th, replacing Luo Zhuoying. This matter is generally considered one of the signs of large-scale US aggression against South China. Soong Tzu-wen is an old and loyal lackey of US imperialism. When the Wedemeyer "Investigation Group" came to China, he served as the "liaison officer" between Wedemeyer and Chiang Kai-shek, "playing an important role" (according to the Associated Press). According to a report in the Shanghai Ta Kung Pao on August 11, the United States has chosen Guangdong as one of the "important bases" for training Kuomintang troops and has suggested to the Chiang government to "use Guangdong Province as the main base for unloading military supplies and provisions shipped to China." At the same time, the American Penny and Lee Corporation has signed a huge economic aggression plan with the Chiang government to invest in Guangdong, Guangxi and Hunan. Soong Tzu-wen's appointment as Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government is clearly to meet the needs of imperialism's large-scale military, political, and economic aggression against South China, and to completely exclude British influence.

    标志美国大举侵略华南
    宋子文出任粤主席
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】据南京消息：蒋匪政府已于十九日任命宋子文为蒋记广东省府主席，以代替罗卓英。此事被一般认为是美国大举侵略华南的标志之一。宋子文为美帝国主义的老牌忠实走狗，当魏德迈“调查团”来华期间，彼曾担任魏德迈与蒋介石间的“连络员”，“起了重要作用”（据美联社）。另据八月十一日上海大公报消息，美国已选择广东为训练国民党军队的“重要基地”之一，并已向蒋政府建议“利用广东省为卸下输华军事物资与供应品的主要基地。”与此同时，美国潘尼、李氏公司已与蒋政府订立投资两广及湖南的庞大经济侵略计划。宋子文的出任广东省府主席，显为适应了帝国主义在军事、政治、经济上大刀阔斧侵略华南，并把英国势力彻底排除出去的需要。
