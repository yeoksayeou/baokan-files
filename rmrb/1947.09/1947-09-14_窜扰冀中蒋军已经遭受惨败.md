Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 12th -- According to a United Press dispatch from Peiping: The disastrous defeat of the Chiang Kai-shek troops intruding into the Daqing River area of central Hebei and the northern section of the Beijing-Hankou Railway can no longer be concealed. The United Press reported that "The offensive against the Communist troops (referring to the People's Liberation Army) in this pivotal area for the past month has been frustrated by ambushes and encirclements." The United Press also reported that because the 150-mile railway between Peiping and Baoding was threatened and controlled by us, the Kuomintang Baoding Pacification Headquarters would flee from Baoding to Fengtai. "The Communist troops have resumed attacks on stations near the suburbs of Peiping and Tianjin." "It is reported that Communist troops, including cavalry, have appeared 20 miles west of Tianjin and in Junliangcheng, 18 miles east of Tianjin."
