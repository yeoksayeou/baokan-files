    Factory No. 1 Celebrates the Great Counter-Offensive
    Workers Compete to Express Resolutions to Increase Production
    Donate Over Three Thousand Catties of Rice on the Spot
    [This Newspaper Reports] The First Machinery Factory of the Industry and Mining Bureau held a factory-wide rally on September 23rd to celebrate the victory of the counter-offensive. Comrade Liao Jinbo, a fitter, took the stage and said, "I am very happy to hear about the victory of the southward army. From now on, I will save 64 catties of rice every month to support the front lines until Chiang Kai-shek is overthrown. I will also donate 2,000 yuan to comfort the soldiers at the front!" Immediately afterwards, fitter Wang Xingshan shouted, "I won't go on stage. I'm very happy. From now on, I will save 30 catties of rice every month to support the front!" Mu Ruihe, a chopper worker who had been liberated for only three months, excitedly rushed to the stage to speak, "Comrades have helped me wholeheartedly, and today I finally recognize what kind of person Chiang Kai-shek is. The Eighth Route Army originally represents us poor proletarians. Chiang Kai-shek is the mortal enemy of us workers and proletarians!" Then Old Mu said, "From now on, I will save 30 catties of rice every month to support the front lines!" Young apprentice Wang Qinghua, machinist Du Xiangfu, and Zhou Zhensheng also spoke one after another, saying that they would sweat more and not waste time. If they wasted work, they would be letting down the southward army! At this point, the audience was already shouting, "I'll save 100 catties every month for a long time!" "The entire machinist class, 18 people save 645 catties!" (Applause), "The entire foundry class, 11 people, save 407 catties!" "I personally save for five months, 60 catties each month!" "I…," the chairman quickly announced, "Please slow down, the two recorders can't keep up!" In this way, people rushed to report their savings, and in just over twenty minutes there were: 49 people saving for the long term, saving a total of 899 catties of rice per month, plus 3,000 yuan. 7 people saving for a short term of three, four, or five months, saving a total of 172 catties of rice per month. 61 people saved in September alone, saving a total of 1,995 catties of rice. The total savings for all in September can reach 3,066 catties, plus 3,000 yuan. (Hong Wen)
