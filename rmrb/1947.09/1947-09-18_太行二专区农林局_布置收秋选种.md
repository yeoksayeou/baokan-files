Taihang Second District Agricultural and Forestry Bureau
  Deploys Autumn Harvest and Seed Selection
    [Our Taihang News] The Second District Commissioner's Office of Agriculture and Forestry Bureau, convened a meeting of farm directors from five counties, including Heshun, Zuoquan, Yushe, Wuxiang, and Xiangyuan, on August 5th, to study the preparations for the autumn harvest in the old liberated areas. Everyone recognized this year: "After drought comes flooding, beware of regrowth," and "Autumn ground is damp, and the climate is dry, beware of hard frost." We must be ideologically prepared early, start early, and in concrete practices: (1) Pre-autumn preparations mainly include wind prevention, frost prevention, and pest prevention (insect pests, bird pests, animal pests—badgers＠, wild boars, etc.). Timely exchange of mass pest prevention methods, and learn Heshun's new frost prevention creation; (2) In terms of autumn harvest preparation, we should collect past experience: "Yellow a patch, cut a patch, thresh a patch, cultivate a patch" to achieve a thorough approach of simultaneous harvesting, threshing, and autumn cultivation; (3) In terms of seed selection, let the masses be ideologically clear, "Strong mother, strong foal," "Seeds are getting better and better," break the masses' rough selection method on the threshing floor, and this year we must achieve field selection, ear selection, and winnowing. The seed selection criteria should be: cold resistance, wind resistance, disease resistance, heavy yield, early maturity, and full grains; (4) Autumn cultivation should be combined with the masses' experience, and propose: "Autumn harvest cultivation under the ground, easy to catch seedlings in spring," "Autumn scratching the skin, better than autumn plowing ten times," organize auxiliary labor, and work together to harvest and cultivate. In short, this year's autumn harvest also needs to leverage our practice of "cadres taking the lead, and labor heroes starting first," to recover the fruits of the liberated farmers' labor on their own land.

　　太行二专区农林局
  　布置收秋选种
    【本报太行讯】二专署农林局，于八月五日召开和顺、左权、榆社、武乡、襄垣等五县农场长会议，研究老区大秋收准备工作，大家都认识到今年：“先旱后涝怕回青”，“秋地阴湿，气候干燥怕硬冻”。必须思想上及早准备，提前下手，在具体作法上：（一）秋前准备主要是防风、防霜、防害（害虫、害鸟、害兽——貉＠、山猪等），及时交流群众防害办法，并学习和顺防霜新创造；（二）秋收准备方面，应集收往年经验：“黄一片，割一片，打一片，耕一片”作到连收带打并秋耕的一扫光办法；（三）选种方面，让群众思想上明确，“母壮驹子，”“种籽是越选越好”，打破群众场上粗选办法，今年要作到田间选种，穗选，风选。选种标准应该是：抗寒、抗风、抗病、收量重，成熟早，籽粒饱；（四）秋耕上要结合群众经验，提出：“秋收耕下地，春天好捉苗”，“秋天划破皮，胜如秋天耕十犁，”组织辅助劳力，连收带耕一齐干。总之，今年秋收还需要发挥我们的“干部起带头，劳英能手先下手”的做法，收回翻身农民在自己土地上劳动所获的果实。
