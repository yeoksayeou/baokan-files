　　Letter from Southern Hebei
　　Lin Shichai
　　"This time, our (Peking University Drama Troupe) went to Southern Hebei to support the army. The working area included Linqing, Weixian, Guantao, and Guanxian. In addition to three performances in Linqing City, the rest were in the countryside.
　　There are currently no rural drama troupes in this area, so there are very few theatrical activities. I once visited Comrade Zhong Kai, the magistrate of Guantao County, who said, "There is not a single drama troupe in the entire Guantao County. One primary school performed a play during the New Year, and although the play was not very good, it caused quite a stir." He also said, "In the past, a Pingyuan Drama Troupe from a certain unit performed here once, and it greatly promoted the work here." Therefore, when we went to the rural areas in this area to perform, the welcome from the masses was rarely seen elsewhere. For example, in Nanxinzhuang, Weixian, the masses voluntarily helped to build the stage and borrow props. Before I even arrived, people had already traveled forty or fifty *li* to see the play two days in advance. On the night of the performance, there were at least three or four thousand spectators. Halfway through the performance, it rained, so we dismantled the stage, took off our costumes, and stopped performing. But the folks didn't leave. They waited for the weather to clear, and when the rain stopped after ten o'clock, they asked us to continue the performance, so we continued to set up the stage and perform. The next day, the number of people increased instead of decreasing.
　　Old opera troupes are still active here, and none of them have been reformed. When we were in Nanxinzhuang, there was also a group of old performers putting on a show. The programs they performed were still things like "Bao Gong Distributing Grain," spreading poisonous ideas. But because there is nothing new to perform here, the masses have to spend a lot of money to hire them to sing.
　　According to a village cadre, "There used to be an old drama troupe here that performed new plays. They performed 'Liu Bocheng Fighting Chiang Kai-shek,' but because they used old movements, makeup, and stage settings, the masses were very dissatisfied, saying that such new things were not interesting to watch."
　　In addition, Chief Zeng of the Propaganda and Education Section of the rear hospital said, "The sick and wounded comrades need entertainment, especially plays, but we can't find a drama troupe. So they saved their food expenses to hire some drum singers, but these drum singers couldn't sing anything except flirtatious songs, so the performance was very ineffective. The next day, we persuaded the sick and wounded comrades to send them away. But the sick and wounded comrades asked the hospital to find a new drama troupe, but the hospital couldn't find one because there weren't any in this area..."
　　Based on these situations (of course, my understanding may not be comprehensive, just the situation in these few counties), we feel that it is a very urgent problem to try to meet the needs of the masses and the sick and wounded comrades in this area as much as possible, and to appropriately establish cultural and recreational propaganda work. We hope that the leadership of all parties can pay serious attention to this situation..."

　　冀南来信
    林十柴
    “我们（北大剧团）这次赴冀南劳军，工作地区是临清、威县、馆陶、冠县一带，除了在临清市演出三次外，其余都是在乡下。
    这一带目前尚没有农村剧团，因此很少戏剧活动。我曾经访问馆陶县长仲凯同志，据他说：“全馆陶县没有一个剧团，有一个小学过年时演了一个戏，戏虽然不太好，但却轰动一时。”他又说：“过去某部的平原剧团曾在这里演过一次戏，对这里工作就起了一次很大的推动作用。”所以，当我们到这一带农村演戏，群众对我们的欢迎，是在其他地方都少见的。比方在威县南辛庄时，群众自动帮助搭台，借导具，我还没到这里，头两天就已经有人从四五十路以外赶来看戏了，演出的那天夜里，观众至少有三四千人。演出一半，下雨了，我们拆了台，卸了装，停演了。可是老乡们都没走，他们等着天晴，十点多钟雨停了，他们要求继续演出，我们便又继续装台演出。第二天人数有增无减。
    这里旧戏班还在活动，而且都没经过改造。当我们在南辛庄的时候，还有一班旧艺人在演戏。演的节目还是“包公放粮”之类传播着毒素的东西。但因为这里没有新的东西演出，所以群众只好花很多钱来请他们唱。
    据一个村干部和我说：“这里过去也有过一个演新戏的旧剧团，他们演过‘刘伯承打蒋介石’，但因为完全是用旧的动作、化装、场道来演，结果群众很不满意，说这样的新东西，看着没有意思。”
    另外，后方医院宣教股的曾股长说：“伤病员同志需要娱乐，尤其是演戏，可是找不到剧团，于是他们自己节省伙食找来几个唱大鼓的，可是这些唱大鼓的除了调情的东西以外，就啥也唱不出来，结果唱了一次，效果很不好。第二天我们说服了伤病员同志，把他们送走了。但是伤病员同志向院方要求找个新剧团，可是院方又找不到，因为这一带没有……。”
    根据上面这些情况（自然我了解的可能不全面，只是上面这几个县的情况），我们觉得，尽量满足这一地区群众，和伤病员同志的要求，把文娱宣传工作适当地建立起来，这是一个很迫切须要解决的问题，希各方领导方面能严重注意这种情况……。”
