　　Hebei-Henan-Shandong Border Region River Defense Militia
  　Captures Fleeing Landlords
  　Full Region Militia Greatly Develops During Re-Examination
    [Hebei-Henan-Shandong Border Region, 6th] The Hebei-Henan-Shandong Border Region's river defense militia strictly guards and blockades fleeing landlords and strikes against Chiang's troops who breach the dikes. The river defense militia in a certain district of Kunwu captured a total of 57 fleeing landlords from March 16 to the end of August, killing and wounding nine enemies, and intercepting a large number of fleeing landlords. On May 6, more than ten Chiang's troops from the Liu Village stronghold across the Yellow River from Zhuanghu Village were digging ditches and building fortifications on the river embankment. Zhang Bingqian, the militia platoon leader, discovered this during patrol and immediately opened fire, killing two enemies, after which the enemy scurried back into the stronghold. On the 10th, seven enemies across from Zhang Village were again digging fortifications on the embankment, one of whom was disguised in plain clothes and directing from the ditch. Our militia again shot and killed him. On July 20, Zhang Tongli, a landlord from Pang Village, Fourth District of Puyang, brought six men and women and many items of clothing, preparing to cross the river and flee, when he was captured by our militia sentry post and sent to the district office to be returned to the masses of the original village for processing. Four landlords from Wang Village, Tenth District of Changyuan, attempted to escape by floating on gourds when the Yellow River rose and the masses and village cadres in the village moved to live on the embankment, but were discovered and seized by the river defense militia patrol.
    [This newspaper, Hebei-Henan-Shandong Border Region, 8th] During the land reform re-examination movement, the male and female militia of all counties in the region controlled the landlords and investigated hidden wealth, truly becoming the armed forces to suppress the landlord class and protect their own interests. Therefore, many peasants requested to join the male and female militia, and the self-defense forces have developed unprecedentedly. Wang Ying (female), director of the Armed Forces Committee of Beiguan Village, Fifth District of Fan County, instructor Yu Hongtao, and 25 female militia members led more than 100 female members, the Children's Corps, and the Sisters' Corps to conduct the re-examination together, detaining the wives of nine landlord families, including Wen Guanxin, and found a large amount of Lu currency, silver, grain, clothing, etc., and while on night sentry duty, they discovered a special agent from Nanfeng Fourth District. The militia of the Fifth District of Changyuan captured enemy spies and cleared out the landlords' materials and weapons during the re-examination, and also crushed the enemy's two grain robberies and conscription attempts in Xiaolü Village and Cao Lü Village, protecting the interests of the masses and maintaining social order. The wife of a martyr from Cuizhuang, Sixth District of Boping, said: "I joined the militia to dig up Chiang's roots to avenge my husband!" She takes care of the home and delivers messages during the day, replacing the male militia to produce. Under her influence, every village in the Sixth District has developed female militia. At the mass meeting in Shacun, Third District of Guanxian, Comrade Jin Dianhai, the militia captain, enlightened the masses' class consciousness and called on everyone to join the militia. An old peasant immediately stood up and said: "I have to join the militia; if I don't arm myself, I can't protect my little cattle, land, and house!" Then, twenty awakened and honest peasants enthusiastically joined the militia. In Sun Dingying Village, First District of Renping, with poor peasants as the leading backbone, nine young people signed up to join the militia in the in-depth re-examination movement of uniting with the middle peasants to protect their fields and eradicate Chiang's roots.
