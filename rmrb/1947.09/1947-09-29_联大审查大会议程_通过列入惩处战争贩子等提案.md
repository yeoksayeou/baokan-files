Xinhua News Agency dispatches from the 25th and 26th: From the 19th to the 20th, the UN General Assembly's Steering Committee completed its discussion of the General Assembly's agenda. The entire agenda consists of 61 items, which were all approved by the General Assembly after review on the 23rd. Although the United States controlled the majority of the fourteen countries on the Steering Committee, the Soviet Union's suggestions to condemn and punish the propagandists of new wars and to implement as quickly as possible the General Assembly's resolution of last year on universal disarmament and the prohibition of the use of atomic weapons, all won unanimous approval at the meeting. Even the United States did not dare to object to this; these proposals also won unanimous agreement at the General Assembly. On the Steering Committee, some reactionary proposals by the United States and its instigated clowns such as Argentina and Greece were passed due to the United States' control of the majority. Soviet and Polish representatives repeatedly opposed these proposals. These include the issue of establishing a "Temporary Committee on Peace and Security" that undermines the functions of the Security Council, the issue of Korea which violates the Moscow Agreement, the so-called Greek border dispute issue, the issue of amending the already effective peace treaty with Italy, the issue of amending the veto power which undermines the UN Charter, the issue of the General Assembly directly deciding on the admission of new member states without the procedure of the Security Council's recommendation, and the issue of Palestine. At the General Assembly, Soviet representative Vyshinsky strongly opposed including these reactionary proposals on the agenda. Vyshinsky believed that according to the decision of the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference, the Korean issue should be resolved directly by the US-Soviet Joint Commission, and the General Assembly has no right to interfere. Amending the peace treaty with Italy violates Article 107 of the UN Charter, which stipulates: "Nothing in the present Charter shall invalidate or preclude action, in relation to any state which during the Second World War has been an enemy of any signatory to the present Charter, taken or authorized as a result of that war by the Governments having responsibility for such action." The establishment of a "Temporary Committee on Peace and Security" undermines the UN Charter and actually cancels the work of the Security Council. Vyshinsky's opposition ultimately failed to pass again due to the manipulation of the meeting by US imperialism. During the meeting, UN Secretary-General Lie delivered a speech that received cheers from the entire audience. Lie solemnly emphasized that no matter how great the political differences between major powers are, it has not created a situation that threatens the existence of the United Nations. Lie said: Only the cooperation of the entire world can cope with the needs. He did not express an opinion on the veto power, but he expressed opposition to amending the existing UN system; and hoped that all countries waiting to join the UN could obtain a decision from the General Assembly.

    联大审查大会议程
    通过列入惩处战争贩子等提案
    【综合新华社廿五、六日电讯】自十九日至廿日，联大指导委员会将大会议程讨论完毕，全部议程共六十一项，廿三日经大会审查后并已全部通过。虽然指导委员会十四国中美国操纵了多数，但苏联所提关于谴责与惩办新战争宣传者及尽速实行去年联大对普遍裁军和禁止使用原子武器决议的建议，都在会上赢得了一致的通过，连美国对此也不敢提出反对；这些提案，在大会上也博得一致的同意。在指导委员会上，美国及其策动下的阿根廷、希腊等小丑的一些反动提案，因在美国操纵多数下竟得通过。苏联与波兰代表一再反对这些提案。其中包括成立破坏安理会职权的“和平安全临时委员会”问题，违背莫斯科协定的朝鲜问题，所谓希腊边境纠纷问题，修改业已生效的对意和约问题，破坏联合国宪章的修改否决权问题，不经安理会建议之程序而由大会直接决定新会员国的入会问题，以及巴勒斯坦问题等；在大会上苏代表维辛斯基仍极力反对把这些反动的提案列入议程。维氏认为按照莫斯科外长会议决定，朝鲜问题应由美苏共同委员会直接解决，联大无权过问。修改对意和约是违反联合国宪章第一○七条的，该条规定：“对于第二次世界大战中本宪章任何签字国之敌国，本宪章并不取消或禁止有关政府对该国所采取或因战争而被授权采取之行动。”成立“和平安全临时委员会”是破坏联合国宪章而且实际上取消了安理会的工作。维氏此种反对终于又因美帝国主义之操纵会场而未得通过。会议中联合国秘书长莱氏发表了一个获得全场欢呼的演说，莱氏郑重强调，不论大国间政治分歧到何种程度，它并未造成威胁联合国存在之局势。莱氏称：只有整个世界的合作，始能应付需要。他对否决权未表示意见，然而他表示反对对现有联合国制度的修改；并希望等待入会的国家均能得到联大之决定。
