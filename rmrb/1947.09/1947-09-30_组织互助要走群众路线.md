    Organizing Mutual Aid Must Follow the Mass Line
    Li Zhuang
    Voluntariness and equivalence are two fundamental keys to consolidating mutual aid. How to truly implement these two principles, and what to do when disputes arise in mutual aid? The mutual aid movement in Qiu County provides a basic solution—implement the mass line.
    The masses participate in mutual aid to obtain its benefits, but the benefits are often not immediately apparent. Of the original five mutual aid groups in Taozhai, the group led by Wang Dianchen had the greatest success. He worked diligently, first achieving results, and then using these results to promote the idea to everyone. The masses love to see facts; they gravitate towards where there are benefits. Seeing Wang Dianchen's success, they wanted to find like-minded people to organize themselves, and the mutual aid groups expanded by five groups at once. Although the masses were willing to participate, they initially had a somewhat experimental attitude. The leadership seized on this mentality and proposed, "Organize however you want." As a result, the masses formed groups for "exchanging plows" and "transferring labor," in a variety of forms. These twenty groups started organizing during weeding. After weeding a section, they calculated the overall account. Mutual aid saved 1,400 labor days. Everyone's enthusiasm increased, and they were willing to continue working together. The leadership took this opportunity to introduce methods for converting labor and calculating labor days, which the masses gladly accepted, and mutual aid was consolidated. Using facts to break through the masses' thinking and enabling them to participate consciously and voluntarily is the concrete mass line. Labor hero Yuan Zhaolin said, "Calculating accounts makes one feel clear-headed." Calculating accounts can quickly break through thought barriers.
    The masses all want to benefit from mutual aid, and sometimes conflicts of interest arise. Near Zhendongbao, it rained during the summer harvest, and the crops had to be weeded after planting. Weeding one day earlier meant a harvest, while weeding one day later meant potential abandonment. Everyone wanted to weed their own land first, and mutual aid was on the verge of collapse. Group leader Wang Hongyuan (a poor peasant) understood the masses' mentality and sounded the alarm: "Time is tight, and if everyone weeds their own land, none of it will be weeded well!" He then mobilized everyone to discuss how to avoid abandoning the land. Realizing that mutual aid was essential, the masses sought solutions within the framework of mutual aid. They decided to divide the large group into smaller groups of two or three people, which saved labor and sped up the process. All the land was weeded well, and mutual aid became even more consolidated. The questions of which plot to harvest first and how much labor was needed often arose as well. Before the wheat harvest, in Li Shengzhuang and Nanliu Village, the group leaders would inspect the fields and democratically assess which plot should be harvested first and which plot should be harvested later, which plot needed more labor and which plot needed less. With the crops growing in the field, everyone could see the situation, and the majority opinion was naturally correct. Some places used a lottery method to solve this problem, which seemed fair because everyone had an equal chance, but this random approach did not truly convince people. When objective facts are presented, and everyone agrees that a certain plot should be harvested first, even the minority would have nothing to say.
    There were also cases where, when assessing how many points each person should receive, everyone agreed on a certain number, but the individual insisted they should receive more. Nanliu Village had a very good experience in solving this problem: if you disagree, conduct an experiment on the spot, with everyone watching. The results are clear for all to see. If someone still refuses to admit defeat after the experiment, then mobilize everyone to persuade them, explaining, "As long as you improve your skills, you will immediately receive more points." This is a form of democratic supervision. As soon as they show some progress, implement mass praise and rewards (adding points). Encouraged in this way, they will be sincerely convinced and automatically ask to improve further, and the dignity of equivalence in mutual aid will be maintained and promoted.
    The mutual aid group in Nanliu Village established many democratic rules. The small group holds a review meeting every five days of work, and temporary problems are resolved through meetings as they arise. During the wheat harvest, the village discussed a wage and bonus system, which the group members implemented very seriously. Village cadre Dong Xiwu did not want to pay wages after others had harvested his wheat, only offering a meal. Some people ate the meal out of politeness, while others left in anger, feeling unhappy. The mutual aid group was almost on the verge of collapse. The leadership invited everyone to a meeting, encouraging them to speak their minds. Those who had not received wages voiced their opinions, and Dong Xiwu made a self-criticism on the spot, paying wages according to the regulations. Everyone laughed, and the next day, mutual production was even more energetic. The masses reflected after the meeting, "It's really good that cadres are treated the same as the masses, without any favoritism." After this meeting, the prestige of the mutual aid group increased even more than before the problem occurred. Yuan Zhaolin said, "It is best to bring incorrect opinions to the table and let everyone judge them. Who is right and who is wrong can be compared at once. With everyone speaking their minds freely and thinking clearly, they will all work hard, and the mutual aid group will be consolidated."
    This spring, there was a lack of rain, and planting was delayed. Therefore, after calling for "early weeding and more weeding," the masses said that the seedlings were too small to weed. The labor heroes and village cadres of Nanliu Village put forward the slogan, "Weed the young seedlings rather than the old ones, weed early to resist drought and control mole crickets." The masses still could not accept this. Yuan Zhaolin and the activists went to the masses to discuss and deliberate, explaining the reasons from both positive and negative perspectives, and finally achieved the goal of early weeding. They gained an important experience in this movement: the deliberation time is best longer, and those who understand will naturally speak up. As more and more people agree, everyone says it is good to do so, and the minority will follow along. After taking a few steps, their thinking will be cleared.

    组织互助要走群众路线
    李庄
    自愿与等价，是巩固互助的两个基本关键。如何真正贯澈这两个原则，在互助当中发生了纠纷怎么办？邱县的互助运动，提供了一个解决问题的基本办法——实行群众路线。
    群众参加互助，是为了得到它的好处，但好处常常不是一下就能看出来的，桃砦原有五个互助组，其中以王殿臣组成绩最大，他埋头苦干的，首先作出成绩，然后拿着这些成绩向大家宣传。群众爱看事实，那里有好处向那里跑，看到王殿臣的成绩，想各找自己的对心思人组织起来，互助组一下扩大了五组。群众虽然愿意参加了，开始多少总带些试验的心情，领导上抓住这种心理，提出“愿怎样组织，就怎样组织”。群众于是有的“碰犋”，有的“拨工”，形式多种多样。这二十个组在锄苗时，开始组织起来，锄完一段算大帐，互助省了一千四百个工，大家热情高了，都愿意继续干下去，领导上趁此机会介绍折工，计工办法，群众欣然接受，互助巩固起来。用事实打通群众思想，使其能自觉自愿的参加，这就是具体的群众路线。劳动英雄袁兆林说：“算帐能使心里清亮。”算帐能较快的打通思想。
    群众都想在互助中得好处，有时就会发生利害冲突。镇东堡附近在暑夤时下雨，种上就得锄，早锄一天能收，晚锄一天就许荒了，各人都想先锄自己的，互助眼看就要垮台，组长王宏元（贫农）了解群众这种心理，向大家敲惊钟：“时间太紧，各锄各的都锄不好！”接着就发动大家讨论，看用什么方法能够不荒了地？群众看着非互助不行，都在互助的前提下想办法，结果决定把大组划成两三个人一伙的小组，互助省工，轮流又快，地都锄得很好，互助从此更巩固了。先收后收那块地？要用多少工？也常常发生问题。李省庄、南刘村在麦收前，由各组长到地里巡视，民主评议先收那块后收那块，那块地需要工多，那块地需要工少，庄稼长在地里，大家都看得见，多数的意见自然是正确的。有些地方用抓的方法，解决这个问题，看起来大家机会均等非常公平，其实这种偶然性的办法，并不能使人心服。客观事实在面前摆着，大家都说该先收这一块，少数人也会没有话说。
    也有一种人，在评定每个人顶多少分的时候，大家都说他应该顶多少，他自己偏说应该顶的多些，南刘村解决这个问题的经验很好：你不服，当场来个试验，大家都看着，好赖就在眼前，有个别的试验了还不认输，这时候就发动大家规劝，说明：“你只要技术进步了，马上就会加分。”这是一种民主监督，在他稍有一些进步时，马上实行群众性的表扬与奖励（加分），他自己经过如此鼓励，就会心悦诚服，自动要求再进步，互助等价的尊严性也因而保持，并发扬了。
    南刘村的互助组，订了许多民主制度，作工五天小组开一次检讨会，发生临时问题随时开会解决，麦收时，村里讨论了工资分红制，组员们都很认真的执行。村干部董希文在别人给他割了麦子以后，不想出工资，只管了一顿饭，有些人只于面子吃了，有些人没有吃堵气走了，心里都不高兴，互助组眼看就几乎要垮台，领导上邀请大家开会，提倡有什么说什么，没有拿到工资的都提出意见，董希文当场作了检讨，照规定开工资，大家哈哈笑，第二天互助生产更有劲了，群众会后纷纷反映：“真是不错，干部与群众一样，没有私情。”经过这次会议，互助组的威信比没有发生问题以前更加提高。袁兆林说：“对不正确的意见，顶好提到桌面上，让大家评判评判，谁对谁不对，一下就可比出来，大家心里不存话，思想上无这无那，都好好作活，互助组就巩固了。”
    今春缺雨，下种很晚，因此要早锄苗，号召“早锄多锄”以后，群众都说苗小不能锄，南刘村的劳动英雄和村干部，提出“青苗锄小不锄老，锄早耐旱治蝼蛄”的口号，群众还是不能接受，袁兆林和积极分子们，就到群众中串地酝酿，正面说了反面说，终于达到了早锄的目的。他们在这次运动中，得到一个重要经验：酝酿时间最好长些，懂事的自然会出来说话，赞成的越来越多，大家都说这么办好，少数人就会跟上走，走过几步，他们的思想也就通了。
