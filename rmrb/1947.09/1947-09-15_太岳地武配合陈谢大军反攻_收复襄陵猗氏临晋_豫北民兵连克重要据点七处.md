　　Xinhua News Agency, Jinji Lu Yu, 13th: The Taiyue local armed groups, militia, and guerrillas launched a powerful offensive, bravely capturing the three cities of Xiangling, Yishi, and Linjin, annihilating more than 500 enemies. After the troops under Generals Chen, Xie, Han, Kong, and Qin crossed the Yellow River and cut off the Longhai Railway, the Chiang bandits besieged in Yuncheng were extremely panicked and urgently sought to open up communication with Shaanxi. They gathered miscellaneous remnants totaling more than 4,000 people, occupying Yishi on the 2nd, Linjin on the 4th, and invading Yuxiang and other places on the 6th. Our local armed groups immediately combined with the militia and guerrillas to fiercely attack Linjin. The enemy fled in panic, and we pursued them to Duncun, ten miles north of Pinglu, and Qilipu, seven miles north, and defeated them. The remaining enemy troops and the bandit Zhang Peng's unit of more than 300 fled to Shangcun, thirty miles north of Pinglu, and were attacked by the Pinglu guerrillas, with 23 killed or wounded, and fled back to Yuncheng in a panic. Another unit of our local armed groups, combined with the guerrillas, captured Yishi at 6 pm on the 9th, killing or wounding more than 100 enemies, capturing more than 300 alive, and seizing a mortar and 13 light and heavy machine guns. Furthermore, the Chiang bandit 30th Division, 27th Brigade, 80th and 89th Regiments, besieged in Linfen in the north, were transferred west to reinforce the Longhai Line, and advanced to the area west of Xiangling on the 7th, encountering our strong resistance. They fled back to Linfen. Taking advantage of the victory, we recovered Xiangling City and the outposts of Zhangli, Xiaojia, Xiajin, and Jiade on the outskirts of Linfen, and annihilated all of the Chiang bandit Fushan police force of more than 100 people in E'she, twenty miles south of Linfen.
    【Xinhua News Agency, Jinji Lu Yu, 13th】The Henan North militia and guerrillas cooperated with the Chen, Xie, Han, Kong, Qin armies in crossing the river south, launching an offensive against the remaining enemies on the Ji (Yuan) Meng (County) line on the north bank of the Yellow River on the 30th of last month. Within two days, they successively captured seven important enemy strongholds, including Baipo, Potou, Dongsai, Zhuzhuang, Nanchen, Yezhu, and Kangyao, driving the remnants of Chiang Kai-shek's local bandits Zhang Bohua and Wei Ansheng entrenched on the line to the south bank of the Yellow River. There are no traces of the enemy in the entire territory of Ji Meng.
