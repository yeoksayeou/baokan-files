Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 23rd: Belated news, the Chen, Su, Chen, Ye, Tang counter-attacking army, after completely annihilating the Chiang bandit 57th Division, simultaneously heavily damaged the Chiang bandit's elite main force, the Fifth Army, killing, wounding, and capturing over 3,000 men. This army, from the Liangshanbo area in mid-August, invaded the Dan County area, and was constantly harassed by people's guerrillas along the way, exhausting themselves. In late August, a powerful force of the People's Liberation Army suddenly appeared in the rear of the army, posing a major threat to the enemy, which then turned north and fled. The Liberation Army immediately launched a fierce attack. On the 26th, a unit of the Liberation Army, in the Zhuzhuang, Dongping, and Xilou areas near Dan County, engaged in a day-long battle in a low-lying area, repelling two regiments of the 200th Division of the army that were attacking from Cao Maji, killing and wounding over 400 of them and capturing over ten platoon leaders and lower ranks. On September 4th, the army concentrated its 200th and 45th Divisions as the front, with the reorganized 88th Division, the reorganized 57th Division, and the pseudo-traitor Wu Huawen's 84th Division as the left and right wings, and advanced on Yuncheng in three routes. The Liberation Army used a small force to block the attack in the area south of Yuncheng, repelling many fierce attacks by the Chiang bandits. On the 8th, when the Chiang bandit's reorganized 68th Division, 143rd Brigade, attacked Hongchuankou to the east, upon hearing that the reorganized 57th Division had been encircled and annihilated at Shatuji, it immediately fled in panic. On the evening of the 8th, a unit of the Liberation Army, with swift movements in the Wang Laohu (south of Yuncheng) Beijiazhuang Daogou area, annihilated the 5th company and anti-tank artillery company of the 2nd battalion, 600th regiment of the 200th Division. On the morning of the 9th, after the reorganized 57th Division was annihilated, the pseudo-Wu Huawen unit immediately retreated to Juye, and the Chiang bandit army, which had been poised to move, turned to holding its ground and awaiting reinforcements. In the past three weeks, the Liberation Army has killed, wounded, and captured more than 3,000 men from the Chiang bandit Fifth Army.
    
Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 22nd: The sound of gunfire is still intense around Shatuji. The first batch of prisoners is already being escorted off the front lines by Liberation Army soldiers. In the prisoner group, there is a group of soldiers speaking with a Shandong accent, excitedly grabbing the hands of several Liberation Army soldiers as if seeing long-lost relatives, and talking as they walk: "We were captured by them (Chiang bandits)", "We are also from the old base area!" The other prisoners cast surprised and envious glances at them.

Zhao Huacheng, from Xing Sanzhuang, Yishui County, said in his first sentence: "Old Chiang is about to be finished, his oil is running out!" With mixed feelings of sadness and joy, he told the reporter: "I was assigned to the 1st squad, 9th company, 10th regiment (under the 60th brigade of the 57th division). There are only two veterans in the squad, and some squads have only one. I was captured while hoeing sorghum for the second time. Comrade, the captured soldiers are useless. Yesterday, as soon as the guns fired, we were so scared that our hands and feet didn't know where to go. The officers cursed, but it didn't work." He then recounted his past experiences of being in a difficult situation: "We haven't stopped moving for more than two months, running from Mengyin to Feixian, Tengxian, Zaozhuang, and then here, running in the wind and rain, not getting enough to eat, not getting enough sleep, soldiers from here and soldiers from there, encountering our Eighth Route Army firing everywhere! We transported four truckloads of ammunition from Juye to Cao County, and as a result, we got back four truckloads of draft dodgers. This time going north, the fighting in the north was fierce, and we were hurriedly ordered to turn back south. We were surrounded just fifty miles away! I knew it in my heart, I always wanted to desert, and it was great to run into the Liberation Army's pocket!" Finally, he added: "You fought in Laiwu, you fought in Menglianggu, and I supported the front lines. Don't I understand when I hear the movements!"

"Quickly wipe out this gang (referring to the Chiang bandits)! They are too bad!" Zhang Anqi, fifteen years old, interjected. "All the young men in Wanliangzhuang, Jiaxiang, have been captured by Old Chiang, and new recruits are sent to the front lines as cannon fodder!" Li Mingqing, an old soldier with a Hunan accent, who was listening intently beside him, suddenly said with indignation: "Who wasn't captured? The old soldiers are even more guilty. After walking all day, we have to keep double guard at night to watch the new recruits. The officers don't treat us like human beings either."

The sound of artillery fire is intermittent, and new prisoners are coming down in batches, forming a long line, happily heading to the rear of the Liberation Army.

    华东我军歼匪三千
    蒋匪精锐主力第五军受重创
    【新华社华东前线廿三日电】迟到消息，陈、粟、陈、叶、唐反攻大军，于全歼蒋匪五十七师前后，同时重创蒋匪精锐主力第五军，毙伤俘三千余名，该军于八月中旬自梁山泊南犯单县一带，沿途遭人民游击队不断袭扰，疲于奔命。八月下旬，解放军强大兵力突然出现于该军后方，该敌受重大威胁，乃回头北窜，解放军立予痛击。二十六日，解放军一部在单县附近之朱庄、东平、西楼，水洼地带经一日激战，击退自曹马集出犯之该军二百师两个团，毙伤其四百余人，俘排长以下十余名。九月四日，该军集中其二百师与四十五师为正面，以整编八十八师，整五十七师及伪逆吴化文之八十四师为左右翼，分三路进犯郓城，解放军以少数兵力阻击于郓城以南地区，打跨蒋匪多次猛攻。八日到城蒋匪整六十八师一四三旅东犯红船口，听说整五十七师在沙土集被围歼，马上仓惶溜走。八日晚，解放军一部又在王老虎（郓城以南）北贾庄道沟以神速动作歼灭二百师六零零团二营第五连及战防炮连。九日晨整五十七师就歼后，伪吴化文部即缩回巨野，原团蠢动之蒋匪军转为固守待援。三周来，解放军共毙伤俘蒋匪第五军三千余人。
    【新华社华东前线二十二日电】沙土集一带枪声正紧，第一批俘虏行列已被解放军战士押着走下火线。在俘虏群中有一伙操山东口音的士兵，兴高彩烈的象见到久别的亲人一样，拉着几个解放军的手边走边谈：“俺是他们（蒋匪）抓来的”，“俺也是咱老根据地的啦！”其他的俘虏都向他们投以惊奇和羡慕的眼光。
    家在沂水县邢三庄的赵华诚第一句话就是：“老蒋快毁啦，他的油快熬尽啦！”他悲喜交集的告诉记者：“俺编在十团（属五七师六十旅）九连一班，班里只有两个老兵，有的班只有一个老兵。俺是锄二遍高粱时被抓的。同志，抓来的兵都不顶用，昨天枪一响就吓得乱哄哄的手脚都没地点搁了，当官的骂娘“也不管用”。他接着追述过去的狼狈情形道：“两个多月没停脚了，从蒙阴到费县、滕县、州，又到这里，风里雨里的跑，又吃不饱，又睡不好，这里兵那里兵，到处碰上咱八路开火！从钜野到曹县拉四车弹药，结果换回来四大车彩号。这次北上，北边打得稀里哗啦，急急忙忙又叫回头向南，刚走了五十里就被包围啦！俺心里有数，平日一心想着开小差，一跑进咱解放军的口袋阵就好啦！”最后他补充道：“你们打莱芜，打孟良崮，俺都支援过前线，一听动静还不明白吗！”
    “快把这伙子（指蒋匪）消灭净吧！太坏了！十五岁的张安起插上了嘴。“咱嘉祥万梁庄年青小伙子都叫老蒋给抓光了，打仗叫新兵打头阵当炮灰！”在旁边正听得出神的一个湖南口音的老兵李明清突然不平的抢着说：“谁不是抓来的，老兵更是罪上加罪，走了一天，晚上还得放双岗看押新兵，当官的一样不把我们当人看。”
    炮声时断时续，新的俘虏一批批的下来，连成一条漫长的行列，愉快的走向解放军后方。
