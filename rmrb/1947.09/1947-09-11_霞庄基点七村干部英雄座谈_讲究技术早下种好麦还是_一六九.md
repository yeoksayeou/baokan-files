(Our newspaper, Li Cheng) The cadres, heroes, activists, and technicians from the seven administrative villages of the Xia Zhuang base point held a wheat sowing technology research conference on the 30th of last month. The experience of sowing "169" wheat was thoroughly studied during the symposium, breaking the confused notion that "169" wheat does not produce high yields. First, Guo Leixing, a labor hero from Yuan Village, said: "Regarding the sowing of 169, regardless of whether the masses understand it or not, I was somewhat unclear in my thinking. When threshing wheat this summer, the 169 was too strong and difficult to mill. The wheat stalks were crushed, and the yield was not higher than that of local wheat. Promoting 169 this year has become a problem." Dong Shousong, a labor hero from Beishe, said: "I don't believe that. Last year, my 17 mu of wheat (169) had half of the stubble changed, and this summer I harvested over ten dan, which was more than one dou per mu compared to local wheat." Wang Jinming, a labor hero from Xia Zhuang, said: "Last year, I planted three mu of 169 in Zhaihou, and this summer I harvested two big dan. How could I have harvested that much if I had planted local wheat?" Yang Qingtang, from the Tinghepu Farmers Association, said: "To promote 169 this year, our hero cadres must take the lead." However, Wang Fengqi, a labor hero from Xia Zhuang, and Li Songhuai, a labor hero from Zhuangtou, said: "It's no longer effective to simply have hero cadres take the lead. The masses don't believe it. 169 is a superior variety, and there's no doubt that it can produce higher yields. We must research the sowing techniques and timing to find out why it's difficult to mill and doesn't produce high yields. Once the masses understand this, they will naturally want to plant more." Guo Leixing, a labor hero from Yuan Village, said: "That's right. I previously said that 169 was difficult to mill and didn't produce high yields, but I have since thought about it. 169 is a bit slower to mature. Last year, when sowing 169, it rained every day during the Grain in Ear period (White Dew), so we couldn't sow in time. The sowing was too late (from the end of White Dew to the beginning of the Autumn Equinox). This summer, we were afraid of hailstorms, so we harvested too early, and the wheat kernels didn't mature fully. That's why it was difficult to mill and the yield wasn't high. As long as we make the masses understand this reason and emphasize technology and sow earlier, it will be easier to promote." From this, everyone's thinking became consistent, and they all acknowledged that 169 could produce higher yields, but it needed to be sown early. Then, everyone discussed the complete set of techniques for sowing wheat, applying fertilizer, and plowing the land. Dong Shousong said: "When changing paddy fields to wheat, the rice stubble must be removed. Apply fertilizer and plow deeply. Don't sow thinly. If there isn't much fertile soil, you can spot-sow or make rows and first sow the seeds, then the fertilizer, and then level it. This way, the wheat yield next year will be no less than that of regular wheat." Wang Fengqi said: "For stubble-changed wheat, it's best to plow open furrows first, then sow the seeds and then the manure. This saves fertilizer and labor, and the wheat can still grow well." Li Songhuai said: "When plowing dry land, you must plow enough three times. The first two plowings should be deeper and finer so that the turned-up raw soil can be easily dried. When sowing, use two legs to sow in rows, with wide ridges for ventilation, which is also good for applying fertilizer midway. This saves labor during harvesting and can produce higher yields." Guo Leixing said: "This year, when sowing 169, sow it before Grain in Ear. Don't be late." Next, everyone studied the two methods of spot sowing and transplanting, which should be used as much as possible in land with little fertilizer. In land with plenty of fertilizer, use the two-legged row sowing method. The Technical Committee will be responsible for guiding the seeds, and all seeds will be disinfected by soaking in warm water, salt water, or ash water.

　　霞庄基点七村干部英雄座谈
  　讲究技术早下种好麦还是“一六九”
    【本报黎城讯】霞庄基点七个行政村干部英雄积极分子技术员于上月三十日召开小麦播种技术研究会议，座谈中对一六九小麦播种经验作了详尽的研究，打破了一六九小麦不多打的糊涂观念。首先元村劳英郭累兴说：“对于种一六九不管群众通不通，我在思想上就有些不通，今年夏天打麦时，一六九六牢，碾不下来，把麦秸都碾烂了，结果比土小麦也不多打，今年推广一六九就成问题。”北社劳英董寿松说：“俺不相信，我去年十七亩麦（一六九）还有一半改茬，今年夏天打了十来大石，比土小麦每亩多打一大斗。”霞庄劳英王金明说：“我去年在寨后种了三亩一六九，今年夏天就打了两大石，要是种土麦怎会打那样多。”停河铺农会杨清堂说：“今年推广一六九，还须咱们英雄干部起带头。”但是霞庄劳英王逢奇和庄头劳英李宋怀说：“光只英雄干部带头，这个老办法是使不上了，群众才不相信哩。一六九是优良品种，能多打粮是没有疑问的，咱们必须从播种技术和种时间上来研究，追求他不好碾和不多打的原因，群众明确了这个，自然就要多种。”元村劳英郭累兴又说：“对啦，我先前说的一六九不好碾，不多打粮食，我这却想开啦，一六九笨一些，去年种一六九因为交节时（白露）天天下雨，不能及时种，下种太迟（白露终秋分开始），今年夏天怕冰雹打，普遍又收割太早，麦籽没结饱，所以打的时候不好碾，收量也不大。只要让群众讨论明白了这个原因，我们讲究技术，早些种，就容易推广了。”由此大家思想上一致起来，都承认一六九能多打，但须早种。然后大家又展开种麦、施肥、犁地整套技术研究，董寿松说：“谷地改麦一定要把谷茬去了，上里肥耕转，不要薄种。要是肥土不多，可以点种，或照垧壕往里先溜种籽，后溜肥，锄平，这样明年打麦比正茬麦也不少打。”王逢奇说：“改茬麦宜先用犁耕开壕，先溜麦籽后溜圊，这样一方面省肥也省工，另方面麦还能长好。”李宋怀说：“垡旱地时必须要耕够三犁，耕二犁时要深一些，细一些，耕起的生土容易晒透，种时要用两条腿楼种，垄宽通风，半路也好上追粪，收割时省工，又能多打粮。”郭累兴说：“今年种一六九，交节前先种它，可不要迟了。”其次大家又研究了肥少的地应尽量采用点种和栽种两种办法，肥多的地，全部改用两条腿楼下种，种籽由技委会负责指导，全部经过温汤或盐水灰水等消毒浸种。（次孟、隆兴、长群、麦生、士廉、爱生）
