    Military Supply Clothing Factory No. 1
    Seizes Red Banner, Rushes to Make Cotton-Padded Clothes
    [Our Newspaper's Report] After the capital reduction and donation movement, the No. 1 Clothing Factory of the Military Region Supply Department proposed the slogan "Increase Production and Seize the Red Banner." The enthusiasm of all the workers in the factory is extremely high. Comrades in the cutting group said: "We competed during the single-layer clothing task, and the red banner fell to the machine group. This time, in the cotton-padded clothing competition, we are determined to do a good job in quantity, quality, and conservation, and seize the red banner." Every comrade has set out their own production increase plan. Zhao Jiangzhu, the leader of the second group, told the whole group: We won a small flag in the first half of the year, incomplete, and we will win another small flag in the second half of the year, and put forward the slogan: "Compare high and low in September and October." The comrades expressed: Guarantee to go to work even with a slight illness. The day after the meeting, comrades Guan Wuhai, Xu Huaiyuan, and others climbed onto the machines as soon as it dawned. The whole group increased from 130 sets per day to 150 sets, and on the third day, they worked hard to increase to 180 sets. Subsequently, the slogan "The more clothes produced, the stricter the inspection" was put forward. When folding clothes, they all check them once to ensure quality is improved at the same time. Liu Haishun, the leader of the third group, was not convinced and proposed: "The second group is fueling up, and we are also fueling up, not letting the second group catch up." Lu Jinku of the sixth group increased from 30 pieces to 40 pieces a day, and Lian Jinfu of the fourth group increased from 40 pieces to 50 pieces. The enthusiasm of the workers is rising day by day. The output of the machine group increased sharply, and the cutting room also increased processing. Seeing that the colored cloth was used up, the machines stopped. Zhang Jinsheng, the captain of the dyeing workshop, immediately mobilized urgently, and everyone got up early to rush to work, increasing from 45 pots to 63 pots per day. Comrades Guo Gengwen, Hu Shiming, and others in the cloth rolling workshop rolled cloth all night to ensure that the cloth dyed on the same day was rolled out on the same day. The two custodians, Gong Changwen and Sun Xinglong, ensured that the cloth was measured as it was rolled, demonstrating tension and enthusiasm that filled the entire factory. (Ge Qin)
