　　Yellow River Flood Area Relief Committee of Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu Provinces
  　Refutes UNRRA American Representative's Rumors
  　Chiang Kai-shek's Breach of the Guan Meng Dike Should Also Be the Responsibility of UNRRA
    [This Newspaper Special Dispatch] Recently, foreign newspapers reported that an American representative of UNRRA, as reported by the Howard newspaper system, fabricated facts and falsely accused our Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu Liberation Army of forcibly transferring relief food and vehicles in Fugou County. In response, our Yellow River Flood Area Relief Committee of Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu Provinces hereby issues the following statement:
    Our Liberation Army has always respected the relief materials and UNRRA personnel in various places and has made every effort to protect them. The so-called forced use of relief food and vehicles in Fugou is completely inconsistent with the true facts. On July 17th, this committee, with the consent of the Fugou working team of the Relief Administration, exchanged 50,000 jin of wheat for 50,000 jin of rice. Both parties had an exchange document as proof, and later borrowed several vehicles from the administration to assist in the transportation of this grain. There was no coercion, let alone the participation of the army. Unexpectedly, during the transportation of the relief goods to the destination, the grain trucks were robbed by the Kuomintang army's 64th Brigade. The true facts are known to the parties involved and the surrounding people. How can such blatant fabrications be allowed to confuse the truth! Since 1938, when the people of the Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu liberated areas suffered the man-made Yellow River breach by Chiang Kai-shek, followed by the disasters of water and war, and then the scourge of Chiang’s civil war, they have been displaced by hunger and cold for nearly ten years. UNRRA has not carried out fair and effective relief, and has always adopted a discriminatory attitude. Even under the earnest appeals of the disaster victims in our area, they have only offered lip service and no actual assistance. The vast majority of the relief materials for the Yellow River flood area have fallen into the hands of corrupt officials of the Chiang regime in the Kuomintang-occupied towns, who have enriched themselves. Even some "relief agencies" have directly assisted the military supply of Chiang's army. On April 27th, the Fugou Relief Working Team served as a food supply station for the 548th Regiment of the 183rd Brigade of Chiang's army, which was "suppressing" the liberated areas of the Yellow River flood area, providing the unit with 60,000 jin of rice. Subsequently, on July 24th, the office of the Zhoukou Relief Administration openly became a garrison stronghold for the Chiang army's traffic police and the 17th Column. UNRRA does not reflect on and blame itself for such actions that violate the United Nations' policy of people's relief, but now reverses black and white, fabricates rumors and slanders. Its intention is obviously to cover up its discriminatory policy against the disaster-stricken people in the Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu liberated areas, and its unjust behavior of helping Chiang to commit abuse. It is even suspected of deliberately distorting public opinion to create a pretext for further assisting Chiang's civil war! We hereby lodge a complaint with all just people in the country and the world, and issue a solemn protest and warning to UNRRA!
    [Xinhua News Agency, Jinji-Luyu, 11th] A spokesman for the Yellow River Committee pointed out to reporters regarding Chiang's breach of the Guan Meng Dike: Chiang's breach of the dike at that location was an attempt to flood the counties south of the Jin Dike, rendering our painstakingly constructed Linyi Yellow River Dike, which took more than a year to build, useless. He would also take the opportunity to breach the Jin Dike, flooding the vast liberated areas north of the Yellow River. The spokesman continued: After the great flood of the Yellow River, UNRRA personnel withdrew and turned a blind eye to Chiang's inhuman atrocities, while providing no relief whatsoever to the people of Quhe and other flooded counties. UNRRA's one-sided and biased accomplice behavior in favor of Chiang's bandits has been completely exposed, and UNRRA can by no means shirk its responsibility.

　　豫皖苏黄泛区救委会
  　驳斥联总美代表造谣
  　蒋贼扒贯孟堤联总亦应负罪责
    【本报特讯】近外报消息：美霍华德系报纸所载联总美国代表虚构事实，诬我豫皖苏解放军在扶沟县强迫移用救济食粮和汽车。对此，我豫皖苏黄泛区救济委员会特发表如下声明：
    我解放军对于各地救济物资及联总人员，素极尊重，并竭力保护；所谓强用扶沟救济食粮汽车云云，完全与事实真象不符。缘本会曾于七月十七日商得救济总署扶沟工作队之同意，以小麦五万斤换取大米五万斤，双方立有交换文据为证，嗣并商借该署汽车数辆协助此项粮食之运输，毫无强迫可言，更无军队参与其间。讵料在运送救济地点途中，此项粮食汽车竟被国民党军六十四旅所劫夺，事实真象为当事人及周围民众所共知，岂容妄加捏造混淆！我豫皖苏解放区人民，自一九三八年惨遭蒋介石制造黄河决口以来，备用水灾、敌灾之后，复历蒋贼内战之祸，饥寒流离已近十载，联总迄未进行公平有效之救济，向采歧视态度，即在我区灾民竭力呼吁恳请之下，亦口惠而实不至。所有黄泛区之救济物资，则绝大部分落于国民党占领之城镇，为蒋记贪官污吏中饱自肥。甚至某些“救济机构”竟直接帮助蒋军军事供应，四月二十七日扶持救济工作队即曾为“进剿”黄泛区解放军之蒋军一八三旅五四八团充当过食粮供应站，供给该部蒋军大米六万斤。此后周口救济总署之办事机关，复于七月二十四日公然成为蒋军交通警察及十七纵队的守备据点。如此种种违反联合国人民救济政策之行动，联总不知自检自责，今反颠倒黑白，造谣中伤，揆其用心，显为企图掩饰其对我豫皖苏解放区受灾人民之歧视政策，及其助蒋为虐之不义行为，甚至令人怀疑其故意歪曲舆论以造成进一步助蒋内战之张本！我们谨向全国全世界正义人士提出控诉，并向联总共正抗议与警告！
    【新华社晋冀鲁豫十一日电】黄委会发言人对蒋贼扒开贯孟堤向记者指出：蒋贼在该处扒堤乃企图淹没金堤以南各县使我艰苦修筑年余之临黄大堤失去作用，并可趁机扒开金堤，泛滥黄河以北之广大解放区。发言人继称：在黄河大泛以后，联总人员就撤走了，且对蒋贼此种绝灭人性的暴行置若罔闻，而对我曲河等县被淹人民，不给分文救济。联总此种片面偏袒蒋贼的帮凶行为，完全暴露无遗，联总已绝不能卸其罪责。
