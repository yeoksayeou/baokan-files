    Guerrilla Stories from Yuncheng
    The reconnaissance squad of the Yuncheng First District, consisting of eight people led by squad leader Comrade Ma Rongxiang, entered the east gate of Tang Village one day. Suddenly, they saw a dozen enemies (from the Fifth Army). Two of them were carrying large cloth bags, stuffing the chickens they had killed into them. Seven or eight others were eating watermelons, and several more were looting from the homes of ordinary people. The whole village was in chaos, with chickens and dogs flying everywhere, young and strong men hiding everywhere, and old women crying and wailing.
    Ma Rongxiang, Jiao Mengfu, and Li Zhongqi fired a few shots at them and charged forward, shouting, "Capture them alive! Capture them alive!" Upon hearing the gunfire, the Chiang soldiers immediately turned tail and ran, dropping helmets, small cloth bags, and watermelons all over the ground. When the common people saw the Eighth Route Army, they gained courage and also shouted, "Capture them alive! Capture them alive!" The Chiang soldiers were so frightened that they ran back to their stronghold. Ma Rongxiang walked to the street, picked up the small chickens dropped by the Chiang soldiers, and went to the home of a villager. An old lady walked over in a panic and said, "Comrade, our good comrade, these are the chickens I bought with the money I earned from spinning! These bad seeds killed them! They want everything! May they die a horrible death!" As she spoke, she pulled them into her house, "Come in and rest, have some soup!" They took out six hundred yuan and asked the old lady to buy another chicken to raise, so it could lay eggs next year, but the old lady refused, "This is nothing! The 'calamity army' ate my chicken, and the Eighth Route Army is paying me back, absolutely not! Oh, you are truly the best!"
    Soon, the villagers all gathered around. A middle-aged man brought a large watermelon and squeezed in, saying, "Comrades, you've worked hard, quench your thirst! We are all on the same side! I wouldn't give it to the 'calamity army' even if they wanted it!" They had no choice but to accept it. Another old lady walked over crying, "I said it was the Eighth Route Army, and it's true, the Eighth Route Army doesn't even bat an eye at us! The 'calamity army', that turtle son, demanded a young girl as soon as he came to my house. I said I didn't have one, and he said, 'If you don't have one, I'll smash your pot'. You see, the chickens were taken away, the pot was smashed, how am I supposed to live!"
    Ma Rongxiang immediately dispatched four scouts to guard the north gate, because there were still enemies in a village two miles away. The militia went to the outpost to monitor the enemy. Then, he convened a village meeting of over a thousand villagers. The songs of the sisters' corps and children's corps resounded throughout the village again. Ma Rongxiang explained the overall situation south of the Yellow River to the masses, and the favorable conditions for persisting in guerrilla warfare, as well as how to carry out land reform during guerrilla warfare. The masses were in high spirits, and the atmosphere became tense and lively again.

    郓城游击故事
    郓城一区的侦察班，共八个人，由班长马荣祥同志带领，有一天，他们走进唐庄东门，突然看见十几个敌人（五军），其中两个背着老大的布袋，正在把打死的鸡往里装，旁边还有七八个正在吃西瓜，还有几个到老百姓家里抢东西去了，全村鸡飞狗跳墙，青壮年吓得到处乱藏，老年妇女齐哭乱号。
    马荣祥和焦孟福李中奇向他们打了几枪，就冲上去了，一面喊“捉活的，捉活的！”蒋军突然一听枪声，撤腿就跑，钢盔、小布袋、西瓜、丢满一地。老百姓一见了八路军，胆就壮了，也跟着喊：“捉活的，捉活的！”蒋军吓得屁滚尿流，跑回到据点里去了。马荣祥走到街上去，拾着蒋军丢下的小鸡，走到老百姓家。一个老太太慌张的走过来说：“同志，我们的好同志，这是我纺花的钱买的小鸡！又叫这些坏种打死了，他们什么都要哩，不得好死的！”说着就把他们向屋里拉“进屋去歇歇，喝点汤去！”他们拿出六百块钱，叫老太太再买个鸡养着，到明年下蛋，但老太太拒绝了：“这算啥呀！‘遭殃军’吃了我的鸡，八路军赔钱，万万不行，咳，你们真是再好没有了！”
    一会老乡们都围了上来，有一个中年人，抱来一个大西瓜，挤进来说：“同志，辛苦了，解解渴吧！都是自己人！‘遭殃军’要吃我还不给哩！”他们就只好接着。又一个老太太哭着走过来：“我说是八路军，一点不假哩，八路军对咱连眼皮都不翻一下呀！‘遭殃军’这龟孙一到我家就要花姑娘，俺说没有，他说‘没有就砸碎你的锅’，你们看，鸡捉走了，锅砸了，叫我怎样过呀！”
    马荣祥立即派了四个侦察员，守住北门，因为离这里二里地外的庄子，还有敌人，民兵到前哨去监视敌人，接着即召集了全村千余人的村民大会，姊妹团儿童团的歌声又响遍了全村，马荣祥向群众讲了黄河南的大局，和坚持游击战的有利条件，游击战中如何土改等，群众情绪极高，空气又紧张活泼起来了。
