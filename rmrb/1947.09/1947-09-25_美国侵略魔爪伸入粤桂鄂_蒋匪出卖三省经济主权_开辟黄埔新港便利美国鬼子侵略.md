Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 21st -- According to delayed news continuously published by the Shanghai Ta Kung Pao in early June, the Chiang government has sold the economic development rights of Guangdong, Guangxi, and Hubei provinces to the United States and is colluding with the United States to plunder Sichuan. It is reported that the Chiang-controlled provincial governments of Guangdong, Guangxi, and Hubei have approved a contract with the Penny, Lee & Co. of Wall Street, New York, allowing the company to carry out aggressive plans in the three provinces to establish petroleum, automobile, glass, and coal mining operations, as well as water channels. The company plans to import large quantities of steel, dyes, factories, and industrial equipment. Penny himself will serve as a senior economic advisor to the Chiang bandit governments of Guangdong and Guangxi (United Press report). At the end of May, the Chiang-controlled Guangdong Provincial Government submitted the following content of this traitorous plan to the Provincial "Council" for approval: "The business entrusted to the American Penny Company for agency contact and management is stipulated as eight items: 1. Guangzhou Gas Plant, 2. Guangdong Automobile Assembly Plant, 3. Guangdong Shipyard (to be established in Guangzhou), 4. Yuebei Baziling Gouyadong Coal Mine, 5. Special agricultural irrigation projects throughout the province, 6. Guangdong Fertilizer Plant (to be established near Guangzhou), 7. Cement Plant (excluding Guangzhou), 8. Glass Factory (to be established in Zhongshan or Huiyang)." The proposal acknowledges that the company has the exclusive right to act as an agent for contact and direct investment, stipulating that "the term of agency is three years, and it can be extended for three years if both parties agree six months before the expiration" (Guangzhou correspondent of the newspaper). On June 2nd, the Chiang-controlled Sichuan authorities also frantically called for "resolutely letting go boldly, borrowing foreign funds, and hiring foreign consultants to break through difficulties and see results as soon as possible" regarding the so-called Sichuan "construction". (Special Rong report of the newspaper).
    
Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 23rd -- After the American imperialist running dog Song Ziwen took office as Chairman of Guangdong Province, he began dredging the Pearl River and opening the Huangpu New Port, making it one of the important military and economic bases for American imperialism to control South China. According to a report by the Central News Agency on the 22nd, in order to open Huangpu Port, the Ministry of Transportation of the Kuomintang government specially established the "Guangzhou Port Engineering Bureau" in Guangzhou and approved 5 billion yuan as the project cost for building the port this year. According to the agency, the dredged Pearl River channel can allow giant ships of over 10,000 tons to directly reach Huangpu, and ships of 5,000 tons can also sail directly to Guangzhou. Huangpu is located at the mouth of the Pearl River in southern Guangdong and is an important gateway to South China. Recently, when Wedemeyer came to China, Chiang Kai-shek promised to sell the port to American imperialism as one of the U.S. imperialist maritime invasion bases. After the port is completed, American imperialism will be able to further completely control South China economically through the port. The United States also promised to supply Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang with murderous military fire through the port to continue the civil war as an exchange condition for Chiang's betrayal of the country.
    
Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 22nd -- According to a United Press New York dispatch on the 18th, citing American Far East expert M. Stewart's article in the National Weekly commenting on Wedemeyer's statement on leaving China, it shows that Wedemeyer has regarded the Chiang government as a colonial regime of the United States. The article stated: "The most meaningful thing in Wedemeyer's statement is that he did not mention the rights of China (the Chiang government) as a sovereign state, which are usually always mentioned." It also said: "The United States has a bad reputation in China because it is aiding and prolonging the life of the decadent (Chiang) regime, which would collapse without such aid." However, the article hinted that even continued assistance could not save the Chiang government from its fate, stating: "The Greek situation can prove that it is not a wise move for the United States to make allies of the weak (referring to the reactionary and traitorous groups hated by the people and therefore isolated), and the latter will prove to be a burden."

    美国侵略魔爪伸入粤桂鄂
    蒋匪出卖三省经济主权
    开辟黄埔新港便利美国鬼子侵略
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】据迟到的六月初沪大公报连续刊载消息，透露蒋政府出卖粤、桂、鄂三省经济开发权与美国，并勾引美国掠夺四川之情形称：蒋记粤、桂、鄂三省省府已批准与纽约银行街之潘尼、李氏公司所订合同，俾该公司得在三省实行开办石油、汽车、玻璃、煤矿、水渠等侵略计划。该公司计划输入大批钢、染料、工厂及工业器材。潘氏本人则任粤、桂两省蒋匪政府之高等经济顾问（合众社电）。五月底蒋记粤省政府提交省“参议会”通过此项卖国方案的内容为“委托美潘尼公司代理接洽经营之事业规定为八项：一、广州市煤汽厂，二、广东汽车装置制造厂，三、广东造船厂（设广州），四、粤北八字岭狗牙洞煤厂，五、全省农田水利特种工程，六、广东肥田料厂（设广州附近），七、士敏土厂（广州除外），八、玻璃厂（设中山或惠阳）。”该议案承认该公司有代理接洽及直接投资之独占权，规定“委托代理三年，期满前六个月，如双方同意可延长三年”（该报广州通讯）。六月二日蒋记四川当局对于所谓四川“建设”亦狂叫“决放手大胆，借外款，聘客卿，突破困难，早观成效”。（该报蓉专电）
    【新华社陕北二十三日电】美帝国主义走狗宋子文出任广东省主席后，已开始疏浚珠江，开辟黄埔新港的工程，使该港成为美帝国主义控制华南的重要军事与经济基地之一。据中央社二十二日报导，为开辟黄埔港，国民党政府交通部特在广州设立“广州港工务局，”并批准以五十亿元作为本年度建筑该港的工程费。据该社称：疏松后之珠江河道，可容一万吨以上巨轮直接到达黄埔，五千吨轮船也可直驶广州。按黄埔位于广东南部珠江入海处，为南中国重要门户。最近魏德迈来华，蒋介石已答应将该港出卖给美帝国主义，作为美帝海上侵略基地之一。该港建成后，美帝国主义当可经由该港进一步在经济上完全控制华南。美国并答应经由该港以杀人军火供应蒋介石匪帮继续内战，作为蒋匪卖国的交换条件。
    【新华社陕北二十二日电】据十八日合众社纽约电，引美国远东问题专家Ｍ·斯蒂瓦特在民族周刊撰文评魏德迈离华声明，显示魏德迈已视蒋政府为美国的殖民地政权，该文称：“魏氏声明中最有意义的是没有提到通常总提到的中国（蒋政府）作为主权国的权利。”并称：“美国在华已声名狼籍，因为它援助与延续衰败的（蒋）政权，若没有此种援助，这政权就会垮台”。但该文暗示纵使继续援助也不能挽求蒋政府之死亡命运称：“希腊局势可以证明美国允作弱者（按指万民痛恨因而陷于孤立的反动卖国贼集团）的盟友，实非聪明之举，而后者将证明是一种负担”。
