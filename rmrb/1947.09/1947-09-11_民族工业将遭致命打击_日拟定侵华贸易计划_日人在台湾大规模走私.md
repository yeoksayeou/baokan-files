Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 8th: According to a Nanjing dispatch in the Tianjin Min Guo Daily on the 24th of last month, sources from Chiang's Ministry of Economic Affairs report that Japan has decided on its trade plan from July 1947 to June 1948. In terms of import value, the United States accounts for 62% of the total, while China accounts for only 6.7%. However, in terms of export value, China accounts for a staggering 24.5%, second only to the United States' 27.6%. According to this calculation, Japan is expected to export over 6.9 billion yen to China (calculated based on January 1927 prices) and import over 5.3 billion yen, meaning Japan's trade surplus with China will be approximately 1.6 billion yen, or over 400 million US dollars based on pre-war exchange rates. At the same time, Japan's trade deficit with the United States will be 42.5 billion yen. In this plan of Japan, the total value of Sino-Japanese trade in the coming year will reach 12.2 billion yen, a scale far exceeding any pre-war year. Due to Chiang Kai-shek's obedience to the will of his American masters in "opening up" Sino-Japanese trade, Japan's dumping of its cheap goods worth 6.9 billion yen (or nearly 2 billion US dollars) into China in the coming year will inflict a final and fatal blow to China's national industries.
Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 8th: According to a Central News Agency Taipei air dispatch reported in the Tianjin Min Guo Daily on the 24th of last month: Japanese openly engage in large-scale smuggling in Taiwan. In the past six months alone, the value of smuggled goods seized by Taiwan Customs has reached approximately 300 million Taiwan dollars (equivalent to over 19 billion Chiang currency), "but in reality, the seized goods only account for one-tenth or two-tenths of the total amount of smuggling." The majority of imported smuggled goods are seafood, cigarettes, Western medicines, chemical products, electrical materials, rubber, tires, bicycle parts, etc.; exports are entirely daily necessities such as rice and sugar. Most of the smuggling vessels depart from Kobe, passing through the Ryukyu Islands to Taiwan. The rampant smuggling is even acknowledged by Chiang's Central News Agency, which states: "Japanese smuggling to Taiwan not only affects tax revenue and disrupts port administration but also easily stirs up Japanese covetousness towards Taiwan."

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 5th: The Chiang government has officially restored Sino-Japanese postal services. According to a United Press Shanghai dispatch on the 4th, Sino-Japanese airmail, which had been interrupted since the beginning of the war, was officially restored for the first time on the 4th. Post offices have begun accepting letters to Japan, and Northwest Airlines will carry Chinese mail to Japan three times a week.

　　民族工业将遭致命打击
  　日拟定侵华贸易计划
  　日人在台湾大规模走私
    【新华社陕北八日电】据天津民国日报上月二十四日载南京专电，蒋记经济部方面消息，日本已决定自一九四七年七月至一九四八年六月之贸易计划，在进口额内，美国占总数百分之六十二，中国仅占百分之六点七；但在出口额中，中国竟占百分之二十四点五，仅次于美国所占的百分之二十七点六。依此计算，日方预定对中国输出为六十九亿余日元，（按以一九二七年一月之价格为计算标准）输入五十三亿余日元，即日本对中国贸易出超约为十六亿日元，按战前汇率折算，达四亿美元以上。同时日本对美国贸易入超则为四百二十五亿日元。在日本这一计划中，未来一年中日贸易总额共达一百二十二亿日元，其规模远超过战前任何一年。由于蒋介石适应美国主人意旨，“开放”了中日贸易，今后一年日本以其六十九亿日元（或约近二十亿美元）的廉价商品向中国倾销，殆将给予中国民族工业以最后致命之打击。
    【新华社陕北八日电】据上月廿四日天津民国日报载中央社台北航讯报导：日人在台湾明目张胆经营大规模走私，半年来仅台湾海关缉获之私货价值即达台币三亿元左右（约合蒋币一百九十多亿元），“但实际上缉获货物，仅及走私总数十分之一、二”。私货进口者多为海产品、纸烟、西药、化学制品、电料、橡皮、车胎、自行车零件等；出口则全系日用必需品的米粮及食糖之类。走私船只多由神户开出经硫球而至台湾。走私之猖獗甚至连蒋记中央社也不得不承认：“日人来台走私，不特影响税收，破坏港政，且易启日人对台觊觎之心。”
    【新华社陕北五日电】蒋政府已正式恢复中日邮政。据合众社上海四日电报导：自战争开始以来即行中断的中日航空邮寄，已于四日首次正式恢复。邮局已接收寄日信件，美国“西北航空公司”每周将带三次中国邮件赴日。
