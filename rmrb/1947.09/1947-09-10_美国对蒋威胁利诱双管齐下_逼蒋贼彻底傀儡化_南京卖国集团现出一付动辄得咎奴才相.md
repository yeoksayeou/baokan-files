　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, September 6th: After Nanjing issued a "polite" explanation regarding Wedemeyer's departure statement, the American capitalist newspapers continued to berate Chiang Kai-shek, insisting that Wedemeyer's statement must be earnestly implemented. According to a Central News Agency telegram from New York to its Nanjing headquarters on September 3rd, the Republican's *New York Herald Tribune* commented on "the reaction to Wedemeyer" stating that while Nanjing's rebuttal to Wedemeyer's statement was "彬彬有礼" (bīnbīnyǒulǐ, refined and courteous), it "has shown that they (referring to Chiang's officials) do not agree with Wedemeyer's statement -- that 'in order to regain and maintain the trust of the people, the central government (Chiang's government) must immediately implement strict and far-reaching political and economic reforms.' The general attitude among Chinese (Chiang's government) officials seems to be that it would have been better if General Wedemeyer had not been sent to China." The newspaper rebuked, "There is now a danger that unless effective remedies are implemented, the Communists will win greater victories in the coming autumn. Unless attention is paid to General Wedemeyer's straightforward criticism and Americans are invited to correct (note: 'invite Americans to correct') the situation that Wedemeyer is indignant about, the war against the Communists will not be won." According to a US Information Service dispatch, the *New York Herald Tribune* on August 31st had denounced the Kuomintang CC Clique as a "Chinese reactionary group," even scolding them for "deserving to be on the Communist payroll," solely because they, while "often anti-communist," "refuse to accept American proposals"; because the CC faction was quite dissatisfied with America's so-called "government reorganization" proposal. The *Milwaukee Journal*'s editorial on the 30th stated, "America is not going to abandon China (Chiang Kai-shek's group), we cannot do that." But it strongly argued, "If we put millions of American dollars into China (referring to Chiang's government), then naturally we have the right to offer suggestions on how to make our money put to the best use? Who will use this money?" Even a partial reorganization of Chiang Kai-shek's government cannot satisfy its American masters. The *St. Louis Post-Dispatch* on the 30th disclosed news from Nanjing that Chiang Kai-shek and important Kuomintang members will discuss Wedemeyer's "straightforward" criticism of China's corruption and incompetence at a week-long meeting starting September 9th (referring to the Kuomintang's Sixth Plenary Session of the Fourth Central Committee). "Qualified Chinese predict that the (Chiang) government will undergo a partial reorganization, and Chiang will implement some personnel eliminations." The newspaper commented, "Chiang Kai-shek is trapped in the mire; a partial reorganization of the corrupt and incompetent government and some eliminations are not enough to cure China's (Chiang's government) terrible disease." The comments of the American big bourgeoisie press show that American imperialism is using "abundant assistance" as bait to force Chiang Kai-shek to comprehensively and thoroughly "reorganize the government" and accept American "advisors'" direct supervision of all departments of Chiang's government, so as to completely puppetize Chiang Kai-shek's regime. This fully exposes the Nanjing traitorous clique's wretched, always fearful, and servile demeanor, and the ferocious face of American imperialism in its attempt to destroy China.

　　美国对蒋威胁利诱双管齐下
  　逼蒋贼彻底傀儡化
    南京卖国集团现出一付动辄得咎奴才相
    【新华社陕北六日电】在南京对魏德迈离华声明发出“有礼貌”的晓晓辩解之后，美国大资本家的报界继续呵斥蒋介石，坚持魏德迈声明必需被切实执行。据中央社三日自纽约发给其南京总社的专电称：共和党的先驱论坛报评论“对魏德迈的反应”说：南京对魏德迈声明的辩驳虽则是“彬彬有礼”的，但“却已表明了他们（指蒋家官员们）不赞同魏德迈的声明——即‘为重获与保持人民的信任起见，中央政府（蒋政府）必须立即实行严厉而远大之政治经济改革。’中国（蒋政府）官员中普遍的态度似乎是宁愿魏德迈将军还是不派到中国来好些。”该报呵斥说：“现在已存在着这样的危险，即除非实行得力的补救之策，在行将到来的秋天，共产党将赢得更重大胜利。除非对魏德迈将军的直率批评予以注意，并邀请美国人来改正（注意：‘请美国人来改正’）魏氏所愤怨的情势，对共产党的战争是不会胜利的。”另据美新闻处电：先驱论坛报于三十一日曾指斥国民党ＣＣ派为“中国反动集团”，甚至痛骂他们“应该列名于共产党的薪水单上”，原因仅为他们虽是“常常反共”，“但却拒绝接受美国的主张”；因为ＣＣ对美国的所谓“改组政府”之主张颇为不满。密尔华基报三十日的社论称：“美国并非将放弃中国（蒋介石集团），我们不能这样做。”但力称：“如果我们把数以百万计的美金化在中国（指蒋政府），那末自然我们有提供意见的权利，怎样才能使我们的钱有最好的用处？谁将运用这些钱？”甚至蒋介石政府的局部改组也不能使其美国主人满意，三十日圣路易邮报披露南京消息，谓蒋介石及国民党重要党员将在九月九日开始之一星期会议（按指国民党六届四中全会）中，讨论魏德迈对中国腐败与无能之“直率”批评。“有资格之华人方面预言（蒋）政府将有局部改组，并由蒋氏实行若干人事的淘汰。”该报评称：“蒋介石已陷于泥沼中；腐败与无能政府之局部改组与若干淘汰，不足以治疗中国（蒋政府）可怕之病症。”美国大资产阶级报界的评论显示：美帝国主义正以“丰富的援助”为饵，迫使蒋介石全面彻底“改组政府”，与接受美国“顾问”对蒋政府各部门的直接监督，使蒋介石政权彻底傀儡化。这充分暴露了南京卖国贼集团动辄得咎的奴才相，与美帝国主义灭亡中国的凶狠面目。
