Eager to Know: The Situation of the Southern Expedition of the Army and the Deeds of the Heroes

To the Editors:
    I am a reader of your newspaper and have the following requests for your newspaper:
    1. We urgently need to know the scenery and various situations in different places. Everyone's heart is pounding with concern for the life of the army going south this time, the sights and sounds along the way, and the situation in the KMT-controlled areas, caring about the reality of victory. But we have only seen one diary of following the army south, and we hope to publish more articles of this kind.
    2. I hope to write more specific facts. The name of Wang Keqin has been seen many times, and it has become a movement, but there are very few wonderful descriptions and reports about him. If we can report the specific facts of how he was brave in battle and how he helped each other, it will be more deeply rooted in the hearts of the people.
    3. Publish more model deeds and lives of leading figures and heroes, so that people can imitate and learn. In 1942, I saw the story of Division Commander Liu not eating sugar because it was too expensive, which moved me very much. Everyone wants to know their origins and experiences. For example, our Division Commander Liu can be said to be a well-known general, and people are eager to know about his life. I hope to publish more articles of this kind.
                                        Reader Zhou Shijun, September 3
                                        ★Comrade Shijun:
    Everyone is excited about the southern expedition of the army. Your letter expresses everyone's hope. We have not done enough in these aspects in the past, and we must try our best to meet the hopes of our readers in the future. At the same time, we also hope that the broad masses of readers and comrades will write more articles and provide materials in these aspects based on what they know. For example, the Henan-Hubei-Anhui border area where Liu and Deng's army went was a revolutionary base area for many years; the work of Chen and Xie's army sweeping across western Henan and southern Shaanxi has also been carried out for more than a day. We hope that comrades who have experienced or know about it will write articles and letters to talk about it. As for the historical traces of heroic generals, we hope that their friends and subordinates will record them and submit them to us. We will also urge front-line reporters to report on the combat situation in the south and the local scenery. The broad masses of people are so fond of the people's heroes and so concerned about the army's counter-offensive, which deeply moves us. We must work hard to satisfy everyone's desires.
                                                Editor, September 12

专栏：

　　渴望知道：大军南征的情况和英雄们的事迹编辑同志：
    我是贵报的一个读者，对贵报有下列要求：
    一、我们急需要知道各地风光、各种情况。这次大军南下部队生活、沿途见闻、蒋管区情况，每个人的心均在跳动着，关心胜利的实况。但我们只看到一篇随军南下日记，我们希望这类文章多登一些。
    二、希望多写具体事实。王克勤一类的名字见过多次，且已成为运动，但关于他的描写报导，精彩的却很少见。若能将他在战斗中如何英勇、如何互助的具体事实报导出来，就更能深入人心。
    三、多登领导人物英雄们的模范事迹和生活，叫人模仿学习。一九四二年我曾看到刘师长嫌糖贵不吃的故事，给我很大感动。他们的出身和经历，也是人人想知道的。比方我们刘师长，可说是妇孺皆知的名将，人们对于他的生平，都渴望知道。这类文章希望多登些。
    　　　　　　　　　　读者周世君九月三日
    　　　　　　　　　　　★世君同志：
    大军南征，人人兴奋。你的信说出了大家的希望。这些方面，我们过去确是作的不够，以后一定要尽量满足读者们的希望。同时也盼望广大的读者同志，各就所知，在这些方面多多写作文章，供给材料。比如刘、邓大军所至的豫鄂皖边区，曾是多年的革命根据地；陈、谢大军横扫的豫西陕南，工作开展也非一日，希望亲身经历或有所知闻的同志们，来稿来信谈一谈。又如英雄将领们的史迹，更望其朋友、部属记述下来交给我们。南下战斗情况和地方风光，我们也当催促前线记者报导。广大的群众对人民的英雄如此爱戴，对大军反攻如此关怀，都使我们深深感动。我们必当努力满足大家的渴望。
