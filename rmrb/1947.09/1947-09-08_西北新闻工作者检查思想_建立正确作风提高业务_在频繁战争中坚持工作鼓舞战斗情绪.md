Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 5th. Northwest News Agency, Northwest General Branch of Xinhua News Agency, Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Masses' Newspaper, and other news workers held a grand gathering on the 9-1 Festival. After Deputy Director Du summarized the work of the past six months, he pointed out that it is necessary to deeply examine ideology, establish a correct style, and improve skills in order to better serve the people of the border region, and that an examination will be carried out at the end of September. Border Government Chairman Lin and CCP Northwest Bureau Deputy Secretary Ma Mingfang also attended and delivered speeches, emphasizing the need to better coordinate the pen and the gun to jointly complete the task of eliminating Hu Zongnan and liberating the Great Northwest; and pointed out that news reports in the border region are far behind actual work, and in the future, self-defense wars, land reform, and the heroic deeds of the people in production should be reflected more broadly and deeply. At the same time, strengthen criticism of the shortcomings in various tasks to help leading organs guide actual work to move forward. To this end, a special call is made to cadres in various places to universally and better value news work and provide care and assistance from all aspects. The news workers present unanimously expressed their determination to inherit the glorious tradition of the Border Region Masses' Newspaper, thoroughly examine their ideology, improve their work, adapt to objective needs, and learn from the brother units of the news army in other liberated areas. In other news, the inaugural issue of the news business journal "News Research" was published on 9-1, with rich content, including papers such as "Oppose Empty Talk," "Learn from the Self-Criticism of the Jin-Sui Daily," and "Strengthen Our Stand and Style."
    Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 6th. News workers in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region persisted in their work during frequent wars. The lead-printed edition of the "Border Region Masses' Newspaper" was never interrupted during the "encirclement and suppression" by Chiang's army. The Guan-Zhong, Long-Dong, San-Bian, Sui-De, and Yan-Shu district newspapers also persisted in oil-printed publications. The deeds of the Guan-Zhong district news workers who persisted in their work during the guerrilla war were particularly moving. The "Guan-Zhong Three-Day Journal," loved by the people of Guan-Zhong, gave great encouragement to the masses in the struggle behind enemy lines. The masses in Chi-Shui County, seeing the newspaper, excitedly said: "We can see our newspaper, we will surely win." The newspaper also sent editors and reporters through the blockade line to penetrate into the Chiang area to establish the "South Line Newspaper," compiled and printed propaganda materials, and distributed them to the Chiang-occupied Great Guan-Zhong area. Wu Huaixin, a correspondent from Xin-Ning County in the area, was also able to write articles frequently during the Chiang army's occupation. In the Yan-Shu district, reporter Huai Luo followed the Yan'an guerrillas to the front line for interviews. The reports he wrote encouraged the fighting spirit of the guerrillas. At present, the field army has established a field branch, and reporters have gone deep into the company and the front line for interviews. Another characteristic of wartime border region news work is the large number of blackboards and small newspapers, such as the oil-printed enlistment small newspaper published when Sui-De launched the enlistment campaign to commend and criticize the good and bad examples in enlistment. The Yi-He Town blackboard newspaper continuously published news of cadres and party members taking the lead in joining the army, which played a great role in promoting enlistment.

　　西北新闻工作者检查思想
  　建立正确作风提高业务
    在频繁战争中坚持工作鼓舞战斗情绪
    【新华社西北五日电】新华社西北总分社、陕甘宁边区群众报等新闻工作者，九一节举行盛大集会。杜副社长于总结半年工作后，指出深入检查思想，建立正确作风，提高业务，以求更好的为边区人民服务，并将于九月底进行检查。边府林主席及中共西北局副书记马明芳也亲临讲话，着重指示要使笔杆和枪杆更好配合，共同完成消灭胡宗南，解放大西北的任务；并指出边区新闻报导大大落后于实际工作，今后应更广泛而深刻地反映自卫战争，土地改革和生产中的人民英雄业迹。同时加强批评各项工作中的缺点，帮助领导机关指导实际工作向前发展。为此特号召各地干部普遍地更好地重视新闻工作。从各方面予以照顾和帮助。到会的新闻工作者一致表示决心继承边区群众报的光荣传统，彻底检查思想，改进工作，适应客观需要。向其他解放区的新闻军兄弟部队看齐。另息，新闻业务刊物“新闻研究”创刊号已于九一出版，内容丰富，包括有“反客里空”及“学习晋绥日报的自我批评”，“锻炼我们的立场与作风”等论文。
    【新华社西北六日电】陕甘宁边区新闻工作者在频繁的战争中坚持工作。“边区群众报”铅印版在蒋军“清剿”中从未中断。关中、陇东、三边、绥德、延属等分区报，亦坚持油印出版。关中分区新闻工作者在游击战争中坚持工作的事迹，尤为动人，关中人民热爱的“关中三日刊”，予敌后坚持斗争给群众很大鼓舞，赤水县群众看到该报兴奋的说：“能看到咱们的报纸了，咱们一定能胜利。”该报并曾派出编辑、记者，通过封锁线，深入蒋区创办“南线报”，编印宣传品，向蒋占之大关中散发，该区新宁县通讯员吴怀信在蒋军侵占期间，亦能经常写稿。在延属分区，记者淮洛随延安游击队深入火线采访，他所写的通讯鼓舞了游击队员们的战斗情绪。现前线野战军已成立野战分社，记者纷纷深入连队及火线采访。战时边区新闻工作的另一特点，即黑板报、小型报的大量出现，如绥德发动参军运动时即出版油印参军小报，表扬和批评参军中的好坏例子。义合镇黑板报连续登载干部党员带头参军消息，在推动参军中起了很大作用。
