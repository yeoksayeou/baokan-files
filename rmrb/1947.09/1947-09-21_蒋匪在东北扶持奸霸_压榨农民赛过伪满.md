Xinhua News Agency, Northeast China, September 19th: On the 16th anniversary of the "September 18th" Incident, our correspondent commented on the current situation of the "Second Manchuria" under Chiang Kai-shek's occupation in Northeast China: Wherever the Chiang Kai-shek bandits go in the occupied areas, they massively collect a large number of puppet police, traitors, special agents, and evil gentry who have been liquidated by the masses or follow them, supporting them to suppress the peasants again. They clamor everywhere to "kill all liquidation committees," implement "joint guarantee" and "joint liability," widely issue "good citizen certificates," and confiscate all the land distributed to the peasants by the democratic government, declaring it "nationally (Chiang Kai-shek) owned." They force peasants to rent the land at high prices, and the land taxes are particularly high. Taking Meihekou, Liaoning, as an example, when it was occupied by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, the land tax exceeded sixteen times that of the puppet Manchurian era. Resident Zheng Shihuan cultivated nine mu of land and was taxed 13,000 yuan in half a season. All tenants must unconditionally guard the landlord's home. If there are "peasants who are unwilling to rent land, they have to provide more labor." (Chiang Kai-shek's regulations) The official document No. 567 of the Civil Affairs Department of the Jilin Provincial Government in the 12th year of Kangde of the puppet Manchuria stipulated: "Ordinary laborers can be calculated by village, and it is appropriate to draw one out of two seasonally." This was already painful enough for the people, but today in the "Second Manchuria" region, regardless of age, weakness, or season, there is hardly a day without labor. This spring, when the Chiang bandits were building fortifications in Siping, the city had only more than 60,000 people, but more than 1 million labor days were spent within a month and a half, averaging more than 30,000 people per day. As for the number of conscripted men, it is even more difficult to enumerate. In the past, in Meihekou alone, troops were conscripted eleven times in half a year. The Chiang bandits, fearing that the people would falsely report their age, conducted "personal inspections" from house to house in various places in the southern section of the China Changchun Railway, using the length of physical stature as the basis for "active service" and "reserve service." Many elderly people who had exceeded the "military service" regulations were included in the conscription, causing people to cut off their fingers, jump into wells, commit suicide, or flee in all directions. The Japanese invaders in the puppet Manchuria used the method of "shipping out" to make the people ten families and nine starving. At that time, their slogan for open plunder was "One heart and one mind, jointly prevent communism." Today, Chiang Kai-shek's "Second Manchuria" is carrying out endless exorbitant taxes under the slogan of "full force to suppress the rebellion." In Panshi County alone, there are more than 70 kinds of taxes such as "autonomy donation," "citizen donation," and "suppression donation." Wherever the Chiang bandits pass, chickens and ducks disappear, and even the remaining chicks are taxed by the pound, so the people call the Chiang bandits "Chicken Leveling Kings." The most shameless of these is the Chiang bandits' Kuomintang fee, which is also apportioned to the people and has become a formal tax. In Guanjia Dayuan, Panshi alone, this tax amounted to 12,500 yuan. During the puppet Manchurian era, the Japanese invaders pretended to be "Japan-Manchuria friendly" and did not dare to openly rape women, while the Chiang bandits, under the slogan of "propriety, justice, integrity, and shame," raped women everywhere. The number of rural women who were gang-raped to death is countless. A certain battalion commander of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Shenyang "married" three times in one month. Many women from good families were forcibly occupied and then sold to brothels. This is the "wife trafficking" that is prevalent in Chiang Kai-shek's troops in Northeast China today. During the puppet Manchurian period, the Japanese invaders carried out village mergers everywhere to deal with the attacks of the Anti-Japanese United Army. Today, in the "Second Manchuria" region, in order to prevent the development of people's guerrilla warfare, they are creating "no-man's villages." When the summer offensive began this year, the Chiang bandits burned all but a few villages along their strongholds and highways in the eastern part of Benxi, the southern part of Fushun, the western part of Xinbin, and the northern part of Huanren. For a whole month, the fire was almost everywhere every night, and the people wailed all over the fields.

    蒋匪在东北扶持奸霸
    压榨农民赛过伪满
    【新华社东北十九日电】“九一八”十六周年纪念时，本社记者评述东北蒋占“二满洲”现状称：在二满洲匪区内蒋匪每到一地便大肆收罗已被群众斗争清算的或尾随而来的大批伪警汉奸特务与恶霸，扶持他们重新镇压农民，到处叫嚣“杀尽清算委员会”，实行“联保”“联坐”，遍发“良民证”，将民主政府分配给农民的日伪土地全部收归“国（蒋介石）有”，以高额强迫农民租佃、田赋尤高。以辽宁、梅河口为例，该地在蒋匪占领时，田赋超过伪满时代的十六倍，居民郑世环耕种九亩地，半季之间即被征税一万三千元，所有佃户必须无条件给地主看守家园。如有“不愿租地的农民，则要多出劳工”。（蒋家规定的）伪满康德十二年吉林省公署民字五百六十七号公文内规定：“普通劳工可按屯闾计算，宜分季节二人抽一”，这样人民已够痛苦了，然而今日“二满洲”地区却不论老幼病弱和“季节”，几乎没有一天不要出工。今春蒋贼构筑四平工事时，全市仅六万余人，在一个半月之内即出工一百余万个，平均每天要三万余人。至于抓丁之多，更难枚举，过去梅河口一地，在半年之内即被征兵十一次，蒋贼唯恐人民虚报年龄，曾在中长路南段各地挨户“检查人身”，以体格之长短为“现役”与“预役”之依据。很多已越过“兵役”规定的老年人，均被列入应征之内，弄得人民自行断指或跳井自杀或逃亡四散者比比皆是。伪满洲时代日寇用以置人民十家九饥饿的办法是“出荷”，当时其进行公开抢夺的口号为“一德一心，共同防共”；今日蒋贼之“二满洲”则在“全力戡乱”口号下，进行无尽止的苛税，仅以前磐石县一地即有“自治捐”“公民捐”“清剿捐”等七十余种，蒋匪所过之地鸡鸭无踪，残存之小鸡，亦按以斤两取税，故人民称蒋匪为“平鸡王”。其中最为无耻者即蒋贼之国民党费，亦摊派到人民身上，而且俨然成为一种正式捐税，此种捐税仅盘石管家大院一地，即出到一万二千五百元。日寇在伪满洲时代假装“日满亲善，犹不敢公开奸污妇女，而蒋贼在大喊“礼义廉和”的口号下，到处进行强奸，农村妇女遭其轮奸以致死者不可数计。沈阳蒋匪某营长曾在一月之内，“结婚”三次，很多良家妇女被其强占后，即转卖给妓院，这就是今日东北蒋家队伍里普遍流行的“太太贩”。伪满洲时日寇为了对付抗日联军的袭击，曾到处实行并村；今天“二满洲”地区为了防止人民游击战争的开展，则大肆制造“无人村，”今年夏季攻势开始之时，蒋匪曾在本溪东部，抚顺南部，新宾西部，桓仁北部的地区内，除其据点及公路沿线之少数村庄外，其余四、五十处村屯，一律实行烧光，整整一个多月，几乎每晚火光烛天，人民哀号遍野。
