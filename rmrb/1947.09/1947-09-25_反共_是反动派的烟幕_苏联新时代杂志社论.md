TASS Moscow Telegram: The New Times magazine published an editorial titled "Anti-Communism - A Smokescreen for Reactionaries," stating: Only half a year has passed since the birth of the Truman Doctrine. This doctrine, under the hypocritical guise of serving democracy and peace, raises the banner of "anti-communism" that has already fallen, thus exposing its true meaning. Because the peoples of all nations have recently seen this banner in the bloody hands of Hitler, Mussolini, and Japanese imperialism, they cannot but pay attention to the wolf's roar conducted under the sheep's clothing decorated with hypocritical democracy. Now, under the relentless spotlight of facts, what was once concealed has been revealed, and the true purpose of the "anti-communist crusade" has been nakedly exposed. "Aid" to Greece and Turkey was declared the first and current goal in Washington's new political strategy. It was said that it was to ensure that the "way of life" of the people of Greece and Turkey would "not be suppressed" and to protect the people of these two countries from the "threat of communism." Now, the whole world recognizes what the rule of the gold envoy in Greece has resulted in. The suffering of the Greek people has greatly increased, and the terror of the royalist fascist authorities, supported by the other side of the ocean, has taken the most terrible form. While countries bordering Greece have made significant progress on the road to post-war reconstruction, Greece's post-war reconstruction and economy have continued to suffer from paralysis. The Greek people are forced to take up arms to defend their independence, free from the harm of anti-people ruling classes and yesterday's German and Italian lackeys, who are trying to remain high above the Greek people with the support of their new masters. In Turkey, American aid is no longer beneficial. Under the eyes of the people of the world, that country is turning into a base for military adventures in the Near East at a frantic rate. The dollars lent to it are being spent on armaments. At the same time, American loans have opened the door to the flooding of the country with American goods, and this flood of American goods into the Turkish market will strangle its young and fragile industry. American economic and political aggression has destroyed the results of the efforts of entire generations of the Turkish people, who have made great progress in establishing national industries in recent decades. The notorious Marshall Plan and its promise of aid to Europe are aimed at disguising the too blatant purpose of the Truman Doctrine. But even this goal has not been achieved. The promise of American aid has been blocked by conditions that insult and endanger freedom-loving and independent people. The hope of American credit loans is destined to be far from realization. And the conditions of the United States are even more violent and cruel. Britain's economic plight has no inspirational effect on other countries, and Britain's unfortunate leaders are making it even deeper into Wall Street's web. Western Europe has not received a single penny of aid under the Marshall Plan, but American warships have already arrived. This is the new "gospel" of gold presented to the world under the banner of the "anti-communist" struggle. Its true meaning is the endless expansion of American imperialists. The people of the United States who demand to rule the people of all nations have chosen the old path where fascism was defeated. Their expansionist plans are not only anti-Soviet, but they also threaten most countries and people. In essence, "anti-communism" is also a direct opposition to the foundations of democracy. And on the banner of anti-communism is written the destruction of democracy. It is no coincidence that fascist tendencies in American domestic life have become more obvious. It is also no coincidence that some countries have suffered a frenzied attack from dollar diplomacy because they have established truly democratic governments after the war and have made the greatest progress in post-war reconstruction. During the war and the fascist occupation, the Communists proved to be the most selfless, firm, and courageous fighters for the freedom and independence of all nations. Can the people of Europe and Asia, whose national independence is now endangered by those who demand world hegemony, forget this fact? In the post-war situation, the Communists are striving to unite all truly democratic forces and all true defenders of freedom and progress, ready to counter reactionary plans, expose new war instigators, and defend the cause of peace. Isn't it for this reason, and with good reason recognizing that they are the most determined and staunch defenders of the people's rights, that the enemies of democracy and peace aim their most poisonous swords at the Communists? Recently, the center of international reaction has shifted to the other side of the ocean (the United States). This has been undoubtedly confirmed by daily life. Democratic societies are turning their eyes to the Soviet Union with greater confidence and hope. Because the Soviet Union has struck back against the attacks of the reactionaries with a strong hand and vigilantly defended the democracy, peace, and security of all nations. In the thirty years since the founding of the Soviet Union, the methods of the reactionary offensive have changed again and again, and all anti-communist, anti-Soviet "theories," "groups," and "axes" have only disappeared shamelessly. But Soviet policy has remained unchanged, and that is the policy of peace, friendship, and cooperation among all nations.

    “反共”是反动派的烟幕
    苏联新时代杂志社论
    【塔斯社莫斯科电】新时代杂志题为“反共——反动派的烟幕”的社论称：杜鲁门主义诞生以来已经半年，这一主义在服务于民主与和平的伪善虚师下却高举起已经倒下了的“反共”的旗帜，因而把它们的真正意义暴露无遗。因为最近才看见过这面在希特勒、墨索里尼和日本帝国主义血手中的旗帜的各族人民，不得不注意这种在用虚伪民主装饰起来的绵羊外衣下进行的狼的咆哮。现在，在事实这无情的探照灯光下，过去曾经掩蔽起来的东西已经显现出来了，而且“反共十字军”的真正目的已经赤裸裸地暴露出来了。“援助”希土被宣布为华盛顿政治新方针中第一和当前的目标。说是要保证希土人民的“生活方式不受压制”，和使这两国人民不受“共产主义的威胁”。现在，全世界都认识了金元特使在希土的统治结果是什么。希腊人民的苦难大大增长，得到大洋对岸支持的保皇党法西斯主义当局的恐怖，已经具有最可怕的形式。当与希腊毗邻的各国在战后复兴的道路上有了重大的进展时，希腊的战后复兴和希腊的经济，却仍然遭受连续不断的麻痹。希腊人民被迫手执武器保卫独立，免受反人民的统治阶级与昨天的德意奴婢的危害，这些家伙企图在他们的新主子支持下仍旧高踞于希腊人民的头上。在土耳其，美国的援助不再是有好处的了。那个国家在全世界人民的眼帘下，以疯狂的速率变为近东军事冒险的基地。借给它的美元正被耗于军备中。同时，美国借款打开了美国倾销货物泛滥该国的大门，而且这种美货泛滥土其耳市场，将绞死它那年青而脆弱的工业。美国经济与政治侵略毁坏了土耳其人民整个世代的努力成果，他们在最近数十年中在建立民族工业方面曾有巨大进展。臭名远扬的马歇尔计划及其对欧援助的诺言，目的在掩饰杜鲁门主义太露骨的目的。但是，甚至这一目的也没有达到。美国援助的诺言，已被侮辱和危害爱好独立自由人民的条件所阻。美国信用借款的希望，势将遥遥无实现之期。而且美国的条件也更加暴戾残酷。英国的经济悲惨危境，对于其他国家决无激励作用，而且英国苦命的领袖们却使它愈益深陷在华尔街的罗网中。西欧远没有得到依照马歇尔计划下的一分钱援助，而美国军舰却已经开来了。这就是在“反共”斗争的旗帜下向世界提出的金元新“福音”。它的真正涵义是美帝国主义者无止境的扩张。美国要求统治全世界各族人民的人们，选择了法西斯被击败了的老路。他们堤扩张主义计划堤锋蓉，不仅有反苏的一面而已，他们威胁大部分国家与人民。实质上，“反共”也就是直接反对民主的基础。而且在反共的旗帜上写的是民主的毁灭这几个字。美国国内生活中法西斯倾向已经更加明显，并不是偶然的。有些国家因为战后成立了真正民主政权而且在战后复兴中获得最大进展，因而遭受美元外交的疯狂进攻，也不是偶然的。在战争与法西斯占领期中，共产党人证明他们是争取各族人民自由与独立的最无我、坚帧与勇敢的战士。民族独立现被要求世界霸权的人所危害的欧亚人民，能够忘记这一事实吗？在战后情况中，共产党人力图团结一切真正民主的力量和一切自由与进步的真正保卫者，准备给反动计划以反击，揭露新战争挑拨者和保卫和平事业。民主与和平的敌人把最毒的剑对准共产党人，不是因为这个理由以及有充分理由认识到他们是人民权利的最坚决与顽强的保卫者吗？近来，国际反动派的中心移到大洋对岸（美国）了。这一点已无可怀疑的为每天的生活所证实了。民主社会以更大的信心和希望，把目光转向苏联。因为苏联以坚强的手回击了反动派的打击，而且警觉地保卫各族人民的民主、和平与安全。在苏联立国的三十年中，反动派攻势的方式已一再改变，一切反共、反苏的“理论”“集团”和“轴心”，都只有无耻地消逝。但苏联政策却仍旧没有改变，这就是各族人民间和平、友好与合作的政策。
