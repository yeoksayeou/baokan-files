　　Siyang Fourth District Compensates for Poor Harvest
  　Wheat Fields Expanded Three and a Half Times
  　Qinyang Fifth District Eliminates Barren Land and Increases Wheat Fields
    [This newspaper's Siyang News] The Fourth District, in order to compensate for the poor harvest and overcome the famine, mobilized the masses to plant a large amount of wheat. The masses in each village successively formulated plans for accumulating fertilizer and planting wheat. For example, in Xigubi, 163 households with 668 people planted 393 mu of wheat, applying 40 dan of fertilizer per mu, with each person planting an average of more than 0.58 mu of wheat. In Tuandazhuang and Dawaqiu, each person planted an average of 0.6 mu of wheat. Under the slogan "Don't plant wheat if you have land but no fertilizer," a fertilizer accumulation campaign was launched throughout the district. Xigubi organized women, children, and semi-laborers to sweep streets and courtyards, burn soil, and pad pigsties. They have already accumulated more than 950 dan of fertilizer. Full laborers are preparing wheat fields in preparation for planting. For example, Ren Chengwen, a model labor hero from Nanzhuang, led the entire village in formulating a wheat planting plan. The whole village, with 44 households and 162 people, prepared to plant half a mu of wheat per person, for a total of 81 mu, applying 45 dan of fertilizer per mu. His slogan is: "Accumulate more fertilizer, plant more wheat, each person plant at least half a mu, apply 45 dan of fertilizer per mu, and overcome the famine year."
    [This newspaper's Qin County News] On the 29th of last month, the Fifth District held an expanded cadre meeting of district and village cadres, with more than 400 cadres and heroes attending. The conference summarized the achievements in frugality for disaster preparedness and production in the previous period. In eliminating barren land and increasing wheat fields, the 29 administrative villages in the district eliminated more than 2,300 mu of barren land in one month. According to statistics from eight administrative villages, 120 mu of virgin land were reclaimed during gaps after rain. In particular, in Lizhuang, under the influence of model village chief Yang Hucheng's personal efforts, the entire village eliminated 320 mu of barren land. Wang Changda, a labor hero from Yaoshangpo, led his group not only to completely eliminate barren land and forcibly plant 80 mu of late autumn buckwheat vegetables, but also to reclaim 35 mu of virgin land. Under the vigorous efforts throughout the district, the district increased wheat fields by more than 4,200 mu this year, preparing food reserves for the spring famine next year. In order to ensure increased wheat production, a straw-cutting fertilizer campaign was launched throughout the district. According to statistics, a total of 680,000 jin of straw was cut. The 4,600 mu of wheat fields in the district now have fertilizer without having to pen sheep. In addition to penning sheep and applying manure, the Wang Changda mutual aid group in Yaoshangpo will apply 60 dan of straw compost fertilizer per mu. Under the resounding wave of increasing fertilizer and increasing production in each village, young men and women in each village are swept into the tide of actively accumulating fertilizer. The whole village of Yangzhuang penned sheep for more than 70 nights, requiring a total of 14 shi of wheat price. Women spun and wove cloth day and night, earning 8 shi, so that the two sides can exchange, the sheep workers have clothes to wear, and the farmers do not worry about fertilizer. The conference concluded that: expanding wheat fields and applying more fertilizer will determine who is a hero in wheat production next year, plow and plant quickly. Cut one piece and plow one piece during the autumn harvest, plow early and apply fertilizer to the fallow land. After the meeting, everyone was in high spirits and made plans to perform meritorious service in the autumn harvest.
