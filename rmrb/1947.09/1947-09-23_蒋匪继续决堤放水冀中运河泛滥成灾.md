Xinhua News Agency, Jin察冀, 21st.—(Delayed news) The Chiang Kai-shek bandits continue to dig rivers and release water in Jizhong, and some areas along the Daqing River and the South Canal have been flooded. On the 30th of last month, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits' 16th Army and a part of the puppet army dug two breaches in the dike near Gaozongchang in Xiong County on the south bank of the Daqing River, and the river water poured into the Baicao depression. Many ripe autumn crops were flooded, resulting in serious losses. The Zhao Wang River and Baiyang Lake will be silted up, and the thousand-mile dike on the south bank of the Daqing River will also be seriously threatened. On August 28th, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits of the 157th Brigade of the 62nd Reorganized Division stationed on the west side of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway at Liuhezhen, colluded with the local puppet army to take advantage of the rising water in the canal and dug a 16-zhang wide breach in the northeast river dike of the town and increased heavy troops to defend it, preventing the masses from rushing to block it. On the same day, they dug a breach more than one zhang wide in the west dike of the canal south of Liuhe. Another unit of the brigade successively dug 33 breaches in the Shao Yaopen in the northeast of Machang southeast of Tangguantun and the Jianhe North Dike, and the river water is rapidly flooding. The masses in the area who rushed to block the breaches were brutally beaten by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. The area near Liuhe has now become a swamp.

    蒋匪继续决堤放水冀中运河泛滥成灾
    【新华社晋察冀二十一日电】（迟到消息）蒋匪续在冀中掘河放水，大清河、南运河沿岸部分地区已泛滥成灾。上月卅日，蒋匪十六军及伪军一部，竟在大清河南岸雄县高冢场附近掘堤两处，河水汹涌灌入百草洼低地。已熟秋禾多遭水淹，损失严重。赵王河、白洋淀均将被淤塞，大清河南岸的千里大堤亦受严重威胁。八月二十八日驻津浦路西侧流河镇蒋匪整六十二师一五七旅一部配合当地伪军趁运河水涨之际，将该镇东北河堤掘开十六方丈宽之决口并增派重兵防守，不让群众抢堵，同日又在流河以南将运河西提掘开一丈余宽决口，该旅另部并相继在唐官屯东南马厂东北之烧窑盆及碱河北堤掘开三十三处，河水正迅速泛滥，该地群众抢堵横遭蒋匪毒打，现流河附近已成泽国。
