    Wanquan Peasants Armed to Protect the Land
    [This dispatch from our Taiyue office, dated 28th] Wanquan peasants are universally engaged in armed protection of the land. Villages like Hou Xiaotan have eliminated their remnant bandits. After the Jinan Campaign, the remnant armed forces of the Chiang bandits continued to rely on "underground elements" in various places to attack and obstruct the peasants' emancipation movement. Peasants in various villages, having been emancipated, armed themselves to defend their emancipation, and by August, the entire county's peasants had universally organized self-defense forces, home-guarding teams, and other armed units, suppressing the sabotage and assassinations of special agents and reactionary landlords. After hearing reports that special agents were coming to capture the cadres of the peasants' association in Hou Xiaotan village, Comrade Xie Hongji immediately went with a gun and grenades, pursuing them all the way to Xiecun Gully, searching all night before returning the next day. The self-defense teams of Beizhanghu, Wanhe and other villages searched out two struggle targets from the city, preventing the bandits from acting at all.
    [This dispatch from our Taiyue office, dated 27th] The Pinglu guerrilla force in southern Shanxi protects the masses' emancipation struggle. On the 7th, the enemy, who had been rampaging through various counties, invaded Dugeta (note: the character consists of soil radical plus da) east of Pinglu city in two routes. Another route, with about a hundred enemies, surrounded the masses and the peasant association who were engaging in speaking bitterness in Qilipo and Shangcun. The Pinglu guerrilla force rushed to the rescue and routed the enemy, rescuing all the arrested masses and peasant association cadres, and capturing twenty enemy soldiers, seizing one machine gun, thirteen rifles, two pistols, and one pair of binoculars. The emancipated peasants said: "They are truly our own troops."
