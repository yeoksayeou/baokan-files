Threatened by Democratic Army Offensive
Factional Strife Within Greek Reactionaries
American Stooge Tsaldaris Forms One-Party Cabinet
[Comprehensive Xinhua News Agency dispatches from the 28th to the 2nd] The Greek petty-royal government recently experienced a cabinet crisis. At a cabinet meeting on the 22nd of last month, the faction led by Themistoklis Sophoulis, Vènizélos, and Kanellopoulos, citing Public Security Minister Servas's "lack of popularity in the United States" as the reason, demanded a redistribution of ministerial positions, replacing Servas with Kanellopoulos as Public Security Minister. However, this was met with staunch opposition from the royalist leader Tsaldaris, who had just returned from seeking instructions in the United States, and Servas. On the 23rd, Sophoulis and the other three ministers submitted their resignations to Prime Minister Maximos, who in turn submitted his resignation the same day. After accepting the resignations, the Greek King immediately appointed Tsaldaris to form a new cabinet. Tsaldaris gladly accepted the mandate and announced that the new cabinet would be sworn in on the 25th. However, according to a United Press dispatch on the 25th, Tsaldaris "suddenly suspended his efforts to form a cabinet" after visiting U.S. Ambassador to Greece MacVeagh to "inquire about the United States' opinion on the cabinet formation." According to TASS, this is related to the United States' current plan to bring Liberal Party leader Sophoulis to power in order to alleviate American public opinion's dissatisfaction with the current Greek government. The United States wants Tsaldaris to organize a so-called "broad cabinet" and "coalition government" to deceive domestic and foreign audiences. Tsaldaris's meeting with Liberal Party leader Sophoulis at the U.S. Embassy on the 26th did not reach an agreement (because Sophoulis believed that "the guerrillas can persist" and dared not come to power.) On the 27th, Tsaldaris's meeting with the Greek King and the U.S. Ambassador also yielded no results. Tsaldaris then stated that he would form a one-party cabinet, but after being reprimanded with "the most undiplomatic language" by Taggart, the head of the U.S. aid mission to Greece, he changed his plans to restore the previous cabinet. However, as predicted by the Greek Democratic Army radio, Tsaldaris's efforts to form a "united" government failed, and his efforts to restore the original members of the previous cabinet also failed. He had no choice but to hastily form a royalist one-party dictatorial fascist cabinet on the 30th, with Tsaldaris wielding absolute power as Prime Minister and Foreign Minister. The new cabinet, facing the threat of the Democratic Army's offensive and the intensification of internal strife (this time, the Greek traitor Servas's faction was also excluded), was unanimously described by the Associated Press, Agence France-Presse, and other news agencies as a "short-lived cabinet" that "cannot last long."
Furthermore, the United States is quite alarmed by the Greek cabinet crisis and the "current predicament of Greece" (Agence France-Presse). On August 29th, it sent Handerson, the director of the Near East Affairs Office of its State Department, to Greece for "investigation."
The Greek Democratic Army radio, commenting on the Greek government crisis, stated that the United States has followed the same dead end as Britain. The heroic struggle of the Greek people will not stop, and no matter who leads the current government, it will inevitably collapse.

　　为民主军攻势所威胁
  　希反动派内部倾轧
    美走狗曹达利斯组一党内阁
    【综合新华社廿八日至二日电】希腊小皇朝政府最近发生阁潮，在上月二十二日在内阁会议上，以斐邦德里欧、维尼兹洛斯、卡尼洛普洛斯为首之一方，以公安部长塞尔瓦斯“在美国不孚众望”为辞，要求重分部长位置，撤换塞氏，改任卡尼洛普洛斯为公安部长。但此事遭到才从美国请示归来的保皇党领袖曹达利斯、塞尔瓦斯等坚决反对。廿三日裴邦德里欧等三部长向首相提出辞呈，首相马克西摩斯同日提总辞职。希王接受辞呈后，立即委任曹达利斯组织新阁，曹氏欣然受命，并宣布新阁将于二十五日宣誓就职。但据合众社廿十五日电，曹氏在往见美驻希大使麦克多“探询美国对组阁意见后，突然暂停组阁努力”。据塔斯社透露：此事与美国现正拉扯自由党领袖索福利斯上台，以缓和美国舆论对希现政府不满的计划有关。美国想要曹达利斯组织所谓“广泛内阁”“联合政府”，以欺骗国内外视听。曹氏二十六日在美大使馆与自由党领袖索福利斯的会谈，未获协议（因为索福利斯相信“游击队能够坚持”，不敢上台。）二十七日，曹氏与希王及美大使会谈亦无结果。曹氏旋表示将组一党内阁，然在美援希代表团团长台其作“最无外交词令”之训斥后，又改图恢复前内阁。然而正如希民主军广播中所预测的，曹达利斯组织“联合”政府未成，恢复前内阁原班人马的努力又告失败，不得不于三十日草草组成保皇党一党独裁法西斯内阁，由曹达利斯独揽总理兼外长大权。新内阁由于面临民主军攻势发展的威胁，而且由于内部倾轧之加剧（按希奸塞尔瓦斯派此次也被排出），以致美联、法新等通讯社一致称之为“短命内阁”“不能久存”。
    又讯：美国对于希内阁危机及“希当前困窘形势”（法新社语）颇为恐慌，八月二十九日又派其国务院近东司司长汉德生赴希“调查”。
    希民主军广播在评论希政府危机时称：美国已走上英国所走的同样绝路。希腊人民的英勇斗争是不会停止的，现政府不论谁来领导，均将不免于崩溃。
