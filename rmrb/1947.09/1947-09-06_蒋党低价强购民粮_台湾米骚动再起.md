　　Chiang Clique's Low-Price Forced Grain Purchases
  　Taiwan Rice Riots Spark Again
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, September 4th: According to an Associated Press dispatch from Shanghai on the 3rd, citing news from Taiwan: Taiwan has recently experienced three serious rice riots, the reason being that the Chiang government in Taiwan is forcibly purchasing grain from the people at an official price half the market price. The riots occurred in Changhua City and Xiluo and Dounan towns in the western plains of Taiwan. It is said that the riots were highly organized, with rioters disarming many police officers and calling on farmers to refuse to accept the official price. The number of casualties in the riots has not yet been reported, it is only known that Kuo Yaoting (transliteration), a Chiang-affiliated National Assembly representative from Changhua, was injured at Changhua Railway Station when the riots reached their peak. The military and political "control" of the Chen Yi era is in fact still continuing, and this dictatorial and corrupt rule was the cause of the Taiwan people's autonomy movement that broke out in February and March of this year.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, September 2nd: Shanghai rice prices, which have always been a signal of price increases, have now suddenly risen. According to an Associated Press dispatch from Shanghai on the 1st, the Shanghai rice price, which had been hovering around 400,000 yuan per dan for two months, soared to 540,000 yuan on the 30th of last month. According to a United Press report, it had already begun to rise sharply to 470,000 yuan per dan on the 28th of last month.

　　蒋党低价强购民粮
  　台湾米骚动再起
    【新华社陕北四日电】据美联社三日沪电引台湾消息：台湾最近发生三次严重的米骚动，原因为蒋政府在台湾以低于市价一半的官价强购民粮。骚动发生于台湾西部平原的彰化市及西螺、斗南两镇。据称：骚动极有组织，骚动者曾解除许多警察的武装，号召农民拒绝接受官价。骚动中伤亡人数，尚无报告，仅知蒋记国大代表彰化人、郭耀亭（译音），在彰化车站当骚动达于高潮时受伤。陈仪时代的军事政治的“管制”实际上仍然继续，此项独裁腐败统治即为今年二月及三月爆发台湾人民自治运动的原因。
    【新华社陕北二日电】一向作为涨价信号之上海米价，现已突然上涨。据美联社上海一日电，两月来均徘徊于每担四十万元的上海米价，于上月三十日已猛涨至五十四万元。按目前合众社报导，上月二十八日已开始突涨至每担四十七万元。
