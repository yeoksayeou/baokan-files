Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 19th: TASS, Moscow, 16th, reported that the Mongolian People's Republic published a statement in the Ulan newspaper on the 10th, refuting the malicious rumors of Chiang Kai-shek's Central News Agency, and revealing the fact that Chiang's army invaded the border of the Mongolian People's Republic seven times from July 31st to August 23rd, plundering livestock and other items. The statement pointed out: "On August 28, 1947, the Mongolian People's Republic issued a communiqué on the true situation in the North Takh Bogd region and the planned invasion of the border of the Mongolian People's Republic by Chinese troops. The Chinese government, disregarding the repeated protests of the Mongolian People's Republic, has not taken measures to stop the provocative actions of its armed forces. On July 31 this year, 20 Chinese troops invaded the area east of Dashin Sala Nuru Mountain, east of North Takh Bogd, within the territory of the Mongolian People's Republic, and attacked residents of Yartai Somangna Gobiartai Village. After looting 135 heads of livestock from several pastures, as well as other valuables, furniture, and sundries, the troops retreated to Xinjiang. On August 8, a group of Chinese troops invaded the territory of the Mongolian People's Republic, penetrating 100 miles deep, and plundered 14 heads of cattle, 20 horses, and 8 camels belonging to seven pastures in Burgan Somangna Kobda Village, before fleeing back to the Xinjiang border. On August 9, 60 Chinese troops invaded the Khuldirtin Gol area (belonging to the North Takh Bogd region) of the People's Republic, attacked Mongolian People's Republic border guards, and retreated to Xinjiang after encountering resistance." The statement also recounted two more invasions on August 15 and 18, and the continuous arson of pastures and grasslands and the digging of trenches within the territory of the Mongolian People's Republic from August 20 to August 23, stating that these were only a few of the incidents. The statement concluded: "According to existing intelligence in Ulaanbaatar, we must point out that the Chinese troops engaged in illegal activities in the North Takh Bogd region are being reinforced. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Mongolian People's Republic hereby declares that the CNA news is completely inconsistent with the facts, and its purpose is to deceive world opinion and conceal the true perpetrators who are continuing to provoke border incidents in the North Takh Bogd region."

    蒙古人民共和国外交部声明
    蒋匪仍不断侵扰蒙边
    蒋中央社恶意造谣图骗世人
    【新华社陕北十九日电】据塔斯社莫斯科十六日电，蒙古人民共和国十日于乌兰报发表声明，驳斥蒋家中央社恶意造谣，并揭露蒋军从七月三十一日至八月二十三日间的七次侵犯蒙古共和国边境掠夺牲口等事实。该声明指出：“一九四七年八月二十八日，蒙古人民共和国曾就北塔克·波格达地区真实情势及中国军队有计划侵犯蒙古人民共和国边境事件发表公报。中国政府不顾蒙古人民共和国数度抗议迄未采取措施，终止其武装部队挑衅行动，本年七月三十一日中国军队二十人。侵入蒙古人民共和国领土内北塔克·波格达东面的达新·萨拉·奴鲁山以东地区，并袭击亚尔泰·索芒那·戈比亚尔泰村的居民，在掠夺若干牧场牲畜一百三十五头，及其他贵重物品与家具杂物后，该部队即退回新疆境内。八月八日，中国军队一股侵入蒙古共和国领土深达百里，在布尔干·索芒那·科勃达村掠去属于七个牧场的牛十四头、马二十匹、骆驼八头后窜回新疆边境。八月九日中国军队六十人，侵入人民共和国领土的呼地尔汀·哥耳区（属于北塔克·波格达地区），袭击蒙古人民共和国边防哨兵，并遭遇抵抗后即退回新疆境内”。声明又历述八月十五日及十八日又两次侵扰，八月二十日至二十三日间，不断纵火焚烧蒙古人民共和国领土内的牧场与草原及挖掘战壕等事实，并谓这些只是其中的数项而已。声明最后指出：“根据乌兰巴托现有的情报，我们必须指出，曾在北塔克·波格达地区从事非法活动的中国军队正在增援。蒙古人民共和国外交部特此声明，中央社消息完全与事实不符，其目的系企图欺骗世界舆论，隐蔽正在北塔克·波格达地区继续挑拨边境事件的真正罪犯”。
