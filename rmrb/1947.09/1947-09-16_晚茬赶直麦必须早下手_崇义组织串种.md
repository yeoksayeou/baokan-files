　　To Seize the Opportunity for Late-Sown Wheat, An Early Start is Crucial
  　Chongyi Organizes Intercropping
    [Our Newspaper, Wu'an Dispatch] This autumn in Chongyi, crops vary in size. The village plans to plant 3,000 mu of wheat, and at least one-third of it will not be ready for early planting. The leadership has proposed taking advantage of the early season by intercropping. There are two schools of thought among the masses: one is "Plowing after the wheat harvest," meaning that no matter how late it is, the stubble must be plowed after the autumn harvest before planting! The other is "Early-season direct-sown wheat," based on past experience, no matter how well the late-sown wheat grows, it won't yield as much as direct-sown wheat. After deliberation, the time, land, labor, and livestock were specifically calculated. First: Early crops can be harvested around the 15th day of the eighth lunar month, which is enough time for planting wheat. Late seedlings are just beginning to sprout ears now, and some haven't even sprouted evenly. According to the saying "One ear or half an ear, a month to the upper field," at least they won't be harvested until the end of the eighth month, and by the time the stubble is cleared, it will be September. This year is a leap year, and the weather will get cold early, so late-sown wheat won't grow. Second: By the beginning of September, the whole village will have to rush to plow the stubble, and if it's all done at once, the livestock won't be able to handle it. Third: The land is wet now and there's enough topsoil, but later it might dry out and it will be too late. After experienced old farmers discussed it, they proposed: "If the Autumn Equinox is in the seventh month, the wheat seeds enter the soil as direct-sown wheat; if the Autumn Equinox is in the eighth month, the wheat will already have sprouted leaves and divided into branches." The masses realized that if they wanted to plant direct-sown wheat, they had to start early. Some people previously wanted to intercrop but felt it was too early, but after deliberation, they changed their minds. On the 24th day of the seventh month, each street organized carpenters to rush to make one-legged and two-legged drills, preparing for large-scale intercropping. On the 26th, it was reported that the village had already made fourteen one-legged drills and three two-legged drills. They are making drills and planting at the same time. On the 26th, it was reported that 148 mu of wheat had already been intercropped, and the total planned intercropping area is 894 mu, to be completed by the fifth day of the eighth month. It is not easy to fertilize intercropped wheat, so each street is mobilizing the use of oil-coated wheat to nourish the seedlings first, and then applying topdressing fertilizer after autumn hoeing. Some people fry sesame rapeseed and sow it together with wheat seeds. Others plow furrows first, apply fertilizer or sesame cake to the furrows, and then sow the wheat seeds. Originally, it was planned that one one-legged drill could intercrop five or six mu a day, but the experimental results showed that it increased to eight or ten mu a day, and a two-legged drill could plant 18 mu a day. The masses all said that intercropping wheat is early-season direct-sown wheat, and it can also be fertilized, so there's no fear that it won't be plowed or planted, which is very convenient.

    [Our Newspaper, Southern Hebei, 14th Dispatch] Men and women in Xisha Geta Village, Sixth District of Ji County, are dividing labor and going all out for the autumn harvest. Labor Hero Yu Luoshan convened a meeting of the mutual aid brigade and said to everyone: "In the past, we cut the sorghum and only picked up the stalks when we had nothing else to do, and then sprouts would grow, and we'd just pull them out! This year, we'll pick up the stalks as soon as we cut the sorghum, and haul the accumulated manure to the fields to plow the land and plant wheat." Luoshan also called on everyone to save wheat to prepare for planting wheat. The teams agreed and made specific plans: men would cut sorghum, pick up stalks, plow land, harvest, and deliver manure; women would sweep sorghum leaves, gather sorghum ears, pull vegetables, and dry crops; and children would beat stalk soil and cut grass to feed cattle. No one, young or old, male or female, was idle. After three days of intensive work, most of the village's sorghum was hauled home. Each household has stopped eating wheat and is drying the saved wheat ears to prepare for planting wheat fields. During the autumn harvest, after Yu Luoshan finished hauling his newly harvested three mu of millet, he followed the dropped millet ears and picked up a large pointed basket weighing more than sixteen catties. He called on others, saying: "If you care about production, there is gold everywhere. As long as you are willing to work, there is food everywhere." Others also followed his example and didn't drop a single grain of millet.

    [Our Newspaper, Jincheng Dispatch] Autumn has arrived, and the crops are ripe. In order to mobilize and organize all forces to launch a concentrated autumn harvest and wheat planting campaign, the various systems in the Second District of this county jointly convened an enlarged meeting of the agricultural association standing committee members, women's group leaders, village deputies, militia captains, children's team captains, cooperative managers, primary school teachers, and chamber of commerce presidents from all 48 administrative villages in the district, as well as model veterans, military martyr family models, and mutual aid group leaders, from September 4th to 5th. A total of more than 2,000 people attended. First, everyone reported on the situation in their respective villages and discussed how to organize all full and part-time laborers in the village to launch a concentrated autumn harvest and wheat planting campaign. After one day of group meetings on the 4th, the conference discussed that each village unanimously proposed to guarantee the autumn harvest and wheat planting for the military martyr families and the families of militia and laborers participating in the war who have no labor force in the village. At the same time, in order to fully support the great counter-offensive, most of the full-time laborers in the village have participated in the war, and all women, children, old men, old women, and all part-time laborers in the village must be organized to fully launch a concentrated autumn harvest and wheat planting campaign. Each village pledged to complete it within one month.

    [Another Dispatch] The time for a concentrated autumn harvest has arrived. Jincheng No. 3 High School has specially started an autumn harvest vacation of one month on September 7th. Before the vacation, all students freely combined into 20 autumn harvest mutual aid groups according to the distance of their residences. Each group and individual specifically formulated a plan for making contributions to the autumn harvest. In addition to helping their own families with the autumn harvest and wheat planting, they will also help one family each of military martyr families and militia and laborers participating in the war who have no labor force in the village with the autumn harvest and wheat planting. When leaving the school, at the dismissal meeting, each group launched a mutual aid competition challenge. After the autumn harvest and school starts, everyone will come to school to compare merits, evaluate merits, and select model students for autumn vacation work. (Wang Yi, Yi Fan)

　　晚茬赶直麦必须早下手
  　崇义组织串种
    【本报武安讯】崇义今年秋天，庄稼大小不一，全村计划种麦子三千亩，至少有三分之一，赶不上早茬，领导上提出赶早种，夹茬串种。群众中有两种思想：一种是“麦收犁垧”，怎么晚也得等到收秋腾了茬，犁犁才能种哩！一种是“早茬直麦”，根据每年经验，晚麦子怎么收，也收不过直麦多。经过酝酿，又把时间、垧土、劳畜力具体计算了一下。第一：早庄稼阴历八月十五前后能够收割，赶上种麦了，晚苗现在才莠穗，有的还没莠齐，按照“一穗半穗，一月上屯。”至少也得到八月底才能收割，腾出茬子就到了九月，今年是闰月年，天气冷的早，晚茬种不上。第二：到九月初全村还要赶茬垡地，挤到一块，牲口忙不过来。第三、现在地湿有垧，晚了怕地干了赶不上。又经过有经验老汉们圪扯，提出了：“七月秋分麦入土，八月秋分麦交股。”意即秋分如在七月，麦籽入土算直麦，如在八月秋分麦子就要长出叶，分出杈股。群众认清种直麦还是早下手，有的人以前想串上，还觉得天气太早，经酝酿后打通了思想。各街七月二十四日一齐组织木匠赶制一条腿、两条腿耧，准备大批串种。二十六日，统计全村已经制成一条腿耧十四个，两条腿三个，一面制耧一面种，二十六日统计已串麦子一百四十八亩，共计划要串麦子八百九十四亩，八月初五全部完成。串麦不容易下粪，各街发动采用油拌麦先养住苗，秋后带锄带上盖头粪。有的是把芝麻菜籽炒过和麦种一齐下地；有的是用犁先串成沟，把粪或麻饼上在沟里，再下上麦种。原计划一个一条腿耧一天能串五、六亩，试验结果，一天增加到了八亩十亩，两条腿耧一天能种十八亩，群众都说，串种麦子，早茬直麦，还能上粪，不怕犁不出来种不上，很是方便。（韩寰）
    【本报冀南十四日电】冀县六区西沙圪塔庄男女分工，全力秋收。劳英郁洛善召开互助大队会议，向大家说：“往年咱们砍了高粱，楂子到没事的时候才拾，长出芽子来，光拔地！今年咱们砍了高粱，就拾楂子，把所积的粪拉到地里，犁地种麦。”洛善并号召大家节省麦子，准备种麦。各队很同意，并作出具体计划：男劳力砍高粱、拾楂子、犁地、收割、送粪、妇女扫高粱叶、杈高粱穗、拔菜、晒庄稼，小孩子打楂子土、割草喂牛，男女老少没有闲人。经三天的紧张忙碌，全村大部高粱拉到家里，各户已停止吃麦子，把节省的麦穗晒起来准备种麦地。秋收中郁洛善把自己刚割的三亩谷子拉完后，就随着拾掉的谷穗，拾了一大尖筐，有十六斤多重。他号召别人说：“对生产关心，遍地黄金，只要肯干，遍地是饭。”别人也都效法他，不掉一穗谷子。
    【本报晋城讯】秋天已到，庄稼已成，为了动员组织全力，突击收秋种麦，本县二区各系统特于九月四号至五号联合召开了全区四十八个行政村农会常委、妇女小组长、村副、民兵队长、儿童队长、合作社经理、小学教员、商会会长以上干部及模范荣退军人、军烈属模范、互助组长扩大会议。共计到会两千人以上。首先让大家汇报了各村情况，讨论了怎样组织全村一切全半劳力突击收秋种麦，经四号一天的小组会。大会讨论，各村都一致提出保证先给全村无劳力的军烈属和参战的民兵、民夫家收秋种麦，同时根据全力支援大反攻，村里绝大部全劳力都参战走了，要把村内所有一切妇女、儿童、老汉、老婆及一切半劳力都组织起来，全力突击收秋种麦。各村都提出保证在一月内完成。
    【又讯】全力突击收秋的时候已到，晋城三高校特于九月七号开始放收秋假一个月，放假前由全体学生按住地远近，自由结合了二十个收秋互助小组，每个组和每个人都具体订出了收秋立功计划，除帮助自己家里收秋种麦外，都还要帮助本村无劳力的军烈属和参战的民兵、民夫各一家，收秋种麦。离校时，在散学会上，各组掀起了互助竞赛挑战，到收罢秋开学后，大家到校比功、评功，选秋假工作模范生。（王毅、义凡）
