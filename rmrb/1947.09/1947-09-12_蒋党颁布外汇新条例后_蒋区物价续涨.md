Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 9th: The fourth wave of price fluctuations in the Chiang-controlled areas this year, triggered by revisions to the foreign exchange regulations, continues to develop. It is not only reflected in the sharp depreciation of the Chiang currency against the US dollar and the surge in prices of export goods, but also in the continuous rise in rice prices. Since rice prices soared from 470,000 to 540,000 yuan per dan (a unit of dry measure) on the 30th of last month, the Chiang authorities have implemented measures to force rice merchants to lower prices and have spread news that the Chiang government will massively dump rice locally (United Press). According to a TASS dispatch from Shanghai on the 8th, rice prices had already risen to 550,000 yuan per dan by the 5th, and the Chiang government authorities have so far failed to fulfill their "promise" to dump rice. According to a report from Nanjing by the same agency on the 8th, Gan Naiguang, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan of the Chiang government, admitted at a press conference: "China (referring to the Chiang-controlled area) is currently encountering an extremely serious economic situation, with extreme panic in various materials and foreign currencies."

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 9th: Shanghai News: After the Chiang government issued new foreign exchange regulations, even the semi-official newspapers here pointed out that this move will not only fail to increase exports of local goods, but will also inevitably lead to higher prices for various commodities, creating a more chaotic situation. The Southeast Daily stated: "After the implementation of the new foreign exchange remittance method, domestic prices will inevitably rise. Under the political and economic situation where the civil war does not stop and military expenditures do not cease, the suffering of the people's livelihood will inevitably be deepened." It also pointed out: "When the exchange rate was 2.02 last year and the supply was abundant, the black market was still rampant. Today's situation cannot eliminate the black market; after the new method is promulgated, it will still form a three-tiered system of 'official price,' 'market price,' and 'black market,' and the future chaotic situation is inevitable." The Ta Kung Pao stated: "If the publicly stated market price deviates too far from the black market price on any given day, foreign exchange remittances will still be evaded, reducing the foreign exchange resources that the state (Chiang family) may obtain." The News Daily said: "In the past, every time foreign exchange was adjusted, the market price of export goods immediately rose, and the benefits of foreign exchange adjustment were completely lost. If this cannot be avoided, the difficulties in export trade will remain unresolved." The American-owned China Press also said: "If the price of export goods rises above the current price in New York or other world markets, then no one will be interested in these export goods."

　　蒋党颁布外汇新条例后
  　蒋区物价续涨
    【新华社陕北九日电】由于修改外汇条例所引起的蒋管区今年第四次物价波动，继续发展。它不仅表现在美汇上的蒋币急剧贬值及出口货价格之激增，且已在米价的不断上升方面表现出来。自上月三十日米价由四十七万暴涨至每担五十四万元后，蒋当局曾实行强迫米商降低办法，并传出将由蒋政府向当地大量倾销大米的消息，米价曾一度下跌（合众社）。据塔斯社上海八日电报导，至五日米价又已上升至共担五十五万元，而且蒋政府当局迄未能履行其倾销大米的“诺言”。据该社八日自南京报导，蒋政府行政院秘书长甘乃光在记者招待会上承认：“中国（指蒋管区）现正遭遇到极端严重的经济情势，各种物资以及外币都发生极大恐慌。”
    【新华社陕北九日电】沪讯：蒋政府颁布外汇新条例后，连此间半官方各报亦均指出此举不仅不能增加土货出口，并且必将引起各种物价高涨，造成更混乱的局面。东南日报称：“新邮汇办法实施后，国内物价势必上涨，在内战不停，军事耗费不止的政治经济局面下，民生的痛苦将必更加深。”并指出：“当去年汇率二·○二。供应充畅时，黑市尚且猖獗，今日的情形更不能消灭黑市；新办法颁布后依然形成‘官价’‘市价’‘黑市’三级制，未来的混乱局面决不可免。”大公报称：公开市价的订定如有一天与黑市相去过远，侨汇仍会发生逃避现象，而使国家（蒋家）可能获得的外汇资源减少。”新闻报说：“过去每次调整外汇，出口物资的市价立即上涨，外汇调整对它的利益即完全消失，这一点如不能设法避免，出口贸易的难关仍无法突破。”美商的大美晚报也说：“如果出口货价格上涨到纽约或其他世界市场现行价格以上，则此等出口货将无人问津。”
