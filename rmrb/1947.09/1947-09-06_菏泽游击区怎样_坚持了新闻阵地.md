　　How the Heze Guerrilla Area
  　Persisted in Maintaining a News Front
    Liu Ruihuang
    Since the Chiang Kai-shek troops occupied Heze, they stationed two brigades outside the city (the 43rd Brigade and the 29th Brigade) and set up strongholds in Wang Haotun, Bizhai, Yaozhuang, Cuilou, Diaotun, Zhaozhai, Shuiniu Li and other villages, constantly carrying out "encirclements" and "suppressions". We were compressed into a small southeastern corner no more than ten li east-west and no more than six li north-south to wage guerrilla warfare. The time between each "suppression" was at most a week, and we had to move two or three times every night to sleep. The enemy changed from "encirclements" and "suppressions" during the day to surrounding villages at night to conduct door-to-door investigations, so we were often chased around. Some comrades were pessimistic and disappointed about persisting in the struggle, lacking confidence. In their lives, they ate and drank extravagantly, did not study or research their work, and went to find vulgar ballads for pointless entertainment. In order to overcome the right-leaning sentiments of the cadres, the county committee held a liaison meeting of county and district propaganda and education cadres on May 22nd, deciding to vigorously carry out propaganda and education work in conjunction with the county-wide merit campaign to eliminate ideological confusion. The first step was to conduct introspection and deliberation, launch a communication campaign, establish communication groups, stipulate that each propaganda cadre should write two articles every half month, and summarize communication work once every half month. The county committee published the "Heze People's Daily." In less than half a month after the meeting, nine communication groups were established, thirty-seven correspondents were developed, and thirty-four articles were received. However, the propaganda department had no printing press and no one to take care of it. After research, it was decided to write with a brush. At that time, Comrade Chai Xiyou, a staff member of the county government's first section, had excellent calligraphy, so he was asked to write the newspaper. If there were good news or titles such as "Experience in Guerrilla Warfare," they would be colored. At that time, a material called "Experience in Guerrilla Warfare" was issued to various districts as teaching material for cadres in the form of this newspaper. After it was sent to the districts, it was stipulated that each district must write ten copies in the same way, so that it could be posted in the market. The people who wrote it were the district chiefs and the directors of the joint associations; but this made people too tired. Other comrades who were fighting guerrillas just lay down to sleep when they arrived at a place, while the comrades who wrote the newspaper had to light a small lamp to write the newspaper and could not get rest. After the newspaper was written, they brought paste with them while fighting guerrillas and pasted it in the market. At night, the armed work team would read it to the masses. The basic masses loved to hear about the overturning of accounts. The masses in a certain village had been unfairly charged more than 15 million by the landlord, and the poor were forced to have nothing to eat. After the masses read the news about the overturning of accounts, they went to the armed work team at night. The armed work team immediately responded to the masses' demands and returned all the things to the masses. Also, Qin Shaohuai, the landlord of Qin Zhuang, served as the enemy's township chief and led the reversal of grain in the village. The armed work team went to beat him up at night, and all the things were returned. It was quickly published in the newspaper, and the masses were very enthusiastic. In this way, within two months, the overturning of accounts was launched in the area fifteen li north of Jinjitou to Pengguai, thirty li south to Libentun, and from Dazhangji in the west to Dingtao City, a radius of forty-five li. Zhao Erdian, the local tyrant and landlord of Zhaozhuang, Shahe, used to lend a lot of high-interest loans. He proposed the slogan of demanding ten times the interest. If there was no money, women would do. The masses hated him the most. After he was shot, the people were very happy and said: "There is still justice. People who do evil will not have a good death. If the Eighth Route Army didn't come, even our wives couldn't be masters of their own homes." Every time there was a market, the people crowded to the place where the newspaper was posted to see if there was any news. Most of the illiterate people surrounded the literate people and asked them to read it aloud for everyone to hear.
    The "Heze People's Daily" published eight issues, which, combined with market propaganda, expanded our victorious influence. For example, after the news of Sun Dianying's capture was published in the newspaper, it quickly spread among the masses; cadres also played a role in mutual learning and exchange of experiences. However, the comrades who wrote the newspaper for a long time felt tired and troublesome, and they had to cook their own meals in the hot weather, and the other comrades were not very energetic. The leaders still explained in many ways, and at the same time planned to buy a mimeograph machine to improve the newspaper. Before the wheat harvest, the second section of the county government borrowed a mimeograph machine from the Armed Forces Committee, and the mimeographed "Heze People's Daily" was officially published in a secret situation. However, the printing technology was not good, and soon the comrades gave two feedbacks: (1) "The People's Daily is not called the People's Daily, it's called 'Black Old,' don't say it's for people to read, it's making it difficult for people!" (2) The comrades who had already started writing said: "It's a pity that the printing is too disappointing!" The old correspondents who had not started writing said that they would not write for the People's Daily, but would transfer to the Jilu豫 Daily to publish. Others said: "I wouldn't even look at this newspaper if it was given to me for free!" The leaders promptly studied the ways to improve the newspaper, praised the active writers and model units, and proposed: "Whoever doesn't write is looking down on the leadership." So the low tide atmosphere rose again. The responsible comrades of each district took the lead in writing. In July, they received forty-eight articles, and a mimeograph machine was also bought.
    At this time, the environment was even more difficult. In the tense situation of the enemy "sweeping" for three days and "suppressing" for two days, the comrades of the newspaper office resolutely fought guerrillas on the one hand and ran the newspaper on the other. The mimeograph machine was always sitting at the entrance of the cave. When the enemy came, they stuffed the mimeograph machine into the cave, and the comrades immediately dispersed; after the enemy's momentum passed, they gathered again. Because the local small groups of special agent armed forces constantly raided our small rear organs and single-line working comrades at night, the newspaper office moved several times a day. Under normal circumstances, they worked during the day and slept in the sorghum stalks in the fields at night; the comrades of the newspaper office resisted "sweeping" with the people during the day and read and printed the newspaper at night, sometimes lighting a small lamp in the wheat field and covering it with a quilt to compile the newspaper. Working in this way, the comrades really felt too bitter, and they often could not get enough to eat. They ran hungry all day and had to cook their own meals. There were few opportunities to rest during the day and night. In order to overcome these difficulties, the county committee promptly proposed to launch a merit campaign, and the leaders promptly supported and took the lead. For example, Comrade Jiang Pinglu, secretary of the county committee, took the lead in writing and made a call at the meeting, which played a great role. On June 16th, a formal call was made to all county cadres at the conference. On July 5th, the county's propaganda and education meeting also solved the issue of military merit recording for communication work, announced the merit recording regulations, and hired thirteen special correspondents; at the same time, the county committee issued some notices and instructions on work summaries to the districts, which were all conveyed through newspapers. In this way, there was an improvement again soon: (1) The enthusiasm for writing rose, and each unit challenged. Shunhe District challenged Lingsheng District, and also challenged the county government. The main content was to see who developed more correspondents and how many articles each person wrote within a limited time. (2) The comrades who looked down on the newspaper also looked at it, "The printing technology is even higher!" For example, a department of the county government used to use the newspapers they received to wrap things, but later they read them solemnly; so the number of manuscripts increased more than doubled every month, and more than one hundred manuscripts were received every month, and the quality of the selected manuscripts was also high. As of the end of July, the number of county correspondents in the entire district had developed to more than eighty people (including more than ten worker and peasant correspondents). At the county cadre meeting in June, the newspaper office received the honorary certificate of the county committee "The spirit of hard struggle is commendable." The comrades of the newspaper office not only expressed their joy in spirit, but their understanding was completely different. Generally speaking: "I didn't expect to be able to make the current newspaper at that time."
    The "Heze Pictorial" was also launched at the same time as the People's Daily (early May this year). At the beginning, only Comrade Geng Yishan, the minister, imitated and drew a few issues of the content of Chiang Kai-shek's betrayal of the country and posted them at the Libentun market. Although many people watched them, most of them could not understand them. Later, two issues were drawn about the Chiang Kai-shek troops stationed there and locked the men in the houses and raped women. The masses were very enthusiastic, and the general reflection was "This picture doesn't talk nonsense at all. The Central Army's rules are too bad, just like the Japanese devils. The Japanese later failed, and the Central Army can't escape either, they must fail." After the comrades of the newspaper office obtained this actual situation, the conclusion drawn after research was that the pictorial should reflect the personal experiences of the masses and the real objects in order to play a role in educating the masses; therefore, the comrades of the newspaper office put their efforts into this issue, and told the story of the enemy raping the granddaughter of Fu Erniangen, the traitorous landlord of Fanhu, and the story of the pseudo-county chief Zhang Kui Sheng arresting soldiers in Liucheng, Shunhe District, etc., and included them in the pictorial as materials for educating the masses. After determining the content, many copies were printed by mimeograph, and then embellished with colors, combined with natural gatherings and various mass meetings for propaganda. The people crowded to see it, and the effect was too great. The reaction of the masses was: "The pictures are all true. It's good that Erniangen got this retribution!" Therefore, the pictorial closely combined with our central task and developed forward.

　　菏泽游击区怎样
  　坚持了新闻阵地
    刘瑞皇
    自蒋军侵占菏泽后，即在城外驻了两个旅的番号（四三旅、二九旅），并在王浩屯、毕寨、姚庄、崔楼、刁屯、赵寨、水牛李等村按设据点，不断“清剿”“扫荡”。我们被压缩在东西不过十里、南北不过六里的东南小角上打游击。每次扫荡的空隙时间，最多不过一礼拜，每天晚上得搬两三个地方睡觉。敌人并由白天的“清剿”“扫荡”，改为晚上包围村庄，进行挨户清查，因而时常被敌人追得“放羊”。部分同志对坚持斗争悲观失望，没有信心，在生活上大吃大喝、不学习不研究工作，到那里专门找些下流鼓词等作无聊消遣。县委会为了克服干部的右倾情绪，即于五月二十二日召开了一个县区宣教干部联系会，决定结合全县立功运动，大力开展宣教工作，肃清思想混乱。第一步进行反省酝酿，开展通讯运动，建立通讯小组，规定每个宣干半月写稿两篇，半月总结通讯工作一次，县委会出版有“菏泽民报”。会后不到半月时间，建立通讯小组九个，发展通讯员三十七名，收到三十四篇稿子，但宣传部无印刷机又无专人照顾，研究结果，决定用毛笔来写。当时县府一科科员柴西右同志，写得一手好毛笔字，就叫他专门写报。如有好消息或游击战反倒算等标题，都用颜色描一下。当时有一篇“对游击战的经验”材料，就用这报的形式，发到各区去作干部教材。发到各区后，规定每区必须照样写十份，以便贴到集市上去，写的人都是区长和联合会主任；但这样使人太累得慌，别的同志打游击到一个地方就歪着睡了，写报的同志还得点个小灯写报，得不到休息，报纸写好后，就随打游击时带上浆糊，贴到集上去，晚上开会时，武工队就向群众念。基本群众爱听反倒算消息，某村群众被地主倒算千五百多万，穷人被迫得没啥吃，群众读到反倒算消息后，晚上去找武工队，武工队当即答复了群众要求，倒回了群众的全部东西。又秦庄地主秦少怀。当敌人乡长，在村里领导倒粮。武工队晚上去把他打歪了，东西都倒回来，很快就登在报上，群众情绪很高。这样一来，金鸡头以北到彭拐一带十五里，向南到李本屯以南三十多里，向西则大张集以东到定陶城，方圆四十五里地，两个多月时间开展了反倒算。沙河赵庄恶霸地主赵二殿，过去放的高利贷很多，他提出口号要提十倍的利，没有钱娘们也行，群众最恼恨他。把他枪毙以后，人心大快，都说：“还有晴天哩，作恶的人得不到好死，八路军要不来，自己老婆也当不了家了。”每次逢集，老百姓都拥挤到贴报的地方去看，有什么消息没有，大部分不识字的都围着请识字的念来大家听听。
    “菏泽民报”出了八期，结合了集市宣传，扩大了我们的胜利影响。如孙殿英被俘的消息在报上登出后，很快就在群众中传遍了；干部在经验上也起了互相学习和交流的作用。但长期写报的同志嫌费劲麻烦，又因天热还得自己作饭，其他同志劲也不高。领导上仍多方面解释，同时计划买油印机，改进报纸。麦征前县府二科借来武委分会的一架油印机，就在偷空情形下，油印机的“菏泽民报”正式出刊了。但印刷技术不好，不久就得到了同志们的两个回响：（一）“民报不叫民报，叫黑老，不要说叫人看啦，是叫人家作难哩！”（二）已动笔的同志说：“可惜印的太不争气啦！”未动笔的老通讯员就表示不给民报写稿，要写就转到冀鲁豫日报出登。还有的说：“这报白送给我也不看！”领导上及时的研究了报纸的改进办法，表扬写稿的积极分子和模范单位，提出：“谁不写稿即是看不起领导”于是低潮的空气又高起来了。各区负责同志，纷纷带头写稿，七月份即收到稿子四十八篇，油印机也买来了。
    这时环境更加艰苦，在敌人三天“扫荡”，两天“清剿”的紧张情况下，报社同志坚决一面打游击，一面办报，油印机老是坐在地洞口，敌人来了，把油印机塞到洞里，同志们马上分散；敌人风头过去后，又集合起来。又因地方小股特务武装不断夜袭我小后方机关及单行工作同志，报社经常是一天数次移动，一般情况下，白天工作，晚上到漫地里高粱棵里睡觉；报社同志白天随老百姓反“扫荡”，夜间阅稿印报，有时到麦地里点上小灯，上面用被子盖起来编报。这样工作下去，同志们精神确也感到太苦了，还经常吃不到饱饭，挨饿跑了一天，还得自己做饭，白天晚上很少休息机会。为克服这些困难，县委又及时提出开展立功运动，领导上及时撑腰带头。如县委书记江平鲁同志带头写稿，并在大会号召，起了很大作用。六月十六日，大会上又向全县干部作了正式号召，七月五日县的宣教会议上，又解决了通讯工作的军独记功问题，宣布了记功条例，聘请了十三位特约通讯员；同时县委对区发表些通知指示工作总结，都通过报纸来传达。这样一来，不久又有了起色：（一）写稿的热潮高起来了，各单位挑战。顺河区向灵圣区挑战，又向县政府挑战的主要内容是看谁发展的通讯员多，限期每人写稿多少篇。（二）瞧不起报纸的同志也看起来了，“印刷的技术更高了”！如县府某部门过去接到报纸，均作了包东西之用，以后都郑重的阅读；所以稿件每月较前增加了一倍多，每月就收到稿子百多件，报纸选稿的质量也高了，截至七月底，全区县通讯员发展到八十多人（内工农通讯员十多人）。六月的全县干部大会上，报社得到县委会“艰苦奋斗精神可嘉”的光荣奖状，报社同志不仅在精神上表了现愉快，在认识上完全两样了。一般的这样说：“当时没想到能弄成现在的报纸”。
    “菏泽画报”也是和民报同时创刊的（今年五月上旬）。开始时只耿部长一山同志仿画了几期蒋介石卖国的内容，贴到立本屯集市上，老百姓看的虽不少，但多不能领会，后来画了二期蒋军驻那里就将男人关在屋子里，又强奸妇女的内容。群众看的热火，很打动人心一般的反映是“这个画一点不瞎说，中央军规矩太坏啦，与日本鬼子一样，日本后来失败，中央军也跑不了，一定失败的。”报社同志得到这个实际情况后，经过研究得出的结论是，画报要反映群众的亲身体验的实事实物，才能起到教育群众的作用；因此报社同志即在这个问题上下了功夫，把敌人住范胡同时强奸了通敌地主傅二年根的孙妻孙女的故事；伪县长张魁生在顺河区刘城抓兵的故事等，尽情的收留到画报中作了教育群众的材料。拟定内容后，以油印印了好多份，再点缀以颜色，结合了自然集会及各种群众会议宣传，老百姓层层拥挤着看，作用太大了。群众的反映是：“画的都是实话，象二年根得到这个报应，不报屈啊，真好！”所以画报就紧紧的结合了我们的中心任务，向前发展了。
