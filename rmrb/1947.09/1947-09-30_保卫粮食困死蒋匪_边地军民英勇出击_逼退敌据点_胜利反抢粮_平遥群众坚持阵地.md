    【This Newspaper, Taiyue, 28th Dispatch】To cooperate with the counter-offensive of the Southern Front army, more than 30,000 people in Pingyao joined the struggle against Yan Xishan's stubborn policy of seizing grain with "knife tactics." After a month of arduous struggle, great achievements have been made, forcing the enemy to retreat from four strongholds: Dongquan, Houshan, Qiaojiashan, and Shuwang Village. Now, all districts have restored their previous positions and rebuilt democratic regimes. In particular, the armed village governments of Getacun in the fifth district, Sujiazhuang in the second district, and Changzecun in the third district have always persisted in the struggle without leaving the village. Under the leadership of Comrades Pei Defu and Wen Huhai, Ze Village launched a campaign to eliminate puppet organizations. On the evening of September 5th, they crushed the stubborn puppet organization in the village, captured special agents Gou Danze, Wen Haicun, etc. alive, and persisted in the struggle in the village. Cadres from villages such as ×× have persisted in their work by relying on tunnels and underground passages, preventing reactionary landlords and special agents from returning to the village and protecting the interests of the masses. At the same time, various guerrilla teams and rotation war teams in small war zones have formed short and capable guerrilla groups to cooperate in penetrating deep into the enemy's rear, making it impossible for the enemy's scattered personnel to move around alone. The local masses then rushed to plant wheat fields: the wheat in Hexi'ao, Wang District, has all been planted. This struggle is now continuing to expand. The soldiers and civilians throughout the county have put forward firm action slogans: "Take down the mountain and fight back! Persist in the struggle without leaving the village," "If you want the village to be peaceful, you must eliminate special agents and reactionary landlords." The county headquarters also called on the soldiers and civilians of the county to learn from the model villages and model comrades who persisted in the struggle behind enemy lines.
