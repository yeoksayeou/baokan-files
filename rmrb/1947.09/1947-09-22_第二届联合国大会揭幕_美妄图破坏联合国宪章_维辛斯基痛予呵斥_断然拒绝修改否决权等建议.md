Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th: New York dispatch: The second UN General Assembly opened at 3 p.m. on the 16th in Flushing Meadow Park, New York. Approximately 1,800 representatives from 55 countries attended. Two meetings were held on the same day, chaired by Brazilian representative Aranha. The General Assembly elected members of the Steering Committee and chairmen of the other six committees. The following fourteen countries were elected as members of the Steering Committee: Soviet Union, United States, United Kingdom, France, China (Chiang), Brazil, Poland, Chile, Luxembourg, India, New Zealand, Mexico, Cuba, and Syria. Luxembourg Foreign Minister Bech was elected Chairman of the Political and Security Committee, Chilean Permanent Representative to the UN, Groza, was elected Chairman of the Economic and Financial Committee, Polish Representative to the Security Council, Lange, was elected Chairman of the Social and Cultural Committee, New Zealand Minister to the US, Berendsen, was elected Chairman of the Trusteeship Committee, Indian Representative, Ali, was elected Chairman of the Administrative and Budgetary Committee, and Syrian Representative to the UN, Al-Holi, was elected Chairman of the Legal Committee. Representatives from the United States, Soviet Union, United Kingdom, France, and China (Chiang) were elected as Vice-Presidents of the General Assembly.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th: New York dispatch: The United Nations General Assembly continued to hold meetings on the 17th and 18th, beginning with a general debate. During the meeting on the 17th, Marshall, following Mexican representative Boude, delivered a lengthy speech. In addition to reiterating his views from the 14th at the United Nations Association of the United States, he was filled with the spirit of undermining the United Nations Charter and attempting to turn the United Nations into a tool for the expansionist and aggressive policies of American imperialism. He emphasized the "amendment" and "restricted use" of the veto power, and he especially wanted to abolish the use of the veto power in Article 6 and Article 4 of the UN Charter. (Note: Article 6 states: "A Member of the United Nations which has persistently violated the principles contained in the present Charter may be expelled from the Organization by the General Assembly upon the recommendation of the Security Council." Article 4 stipulates that the admission of new member states "will be decided by the General Assembly upon the recommendation of the Security Council.") He also arrogantly proposed the establishment of a so-called "Interim Committee on Peace and Security" under the United Nations General Assembly, plotting to replace the actual work of the Security Council with it. He also suggested that the General Assembly include the Korean question on the agenda. He even attributed the failure to resolve the issue of atomic energy control and the failure to implement disarmament to the fact that a peace treaty with Germany and Japan had not been concluded, and that the Soviet Union did not agree with the US plan to unilaterally control atomic energy. After Marshall's speech, Polish Foreign Minister Modzelewski strongly criticized the attempt to amend the United Nations Charter and the veto power. He said: "Poland will firmly oppose all attempts to divide the world into hostile camps and the attempts currently being launched by certain powers to revive the German aggressors in violation of the Potsdam Agreement." Modzelewski demanded "the withdrawal of foreign troops from Greece and the implementation of genuine disarmament." At the meeting on the 18th, Chiang's representative Wang Shijie spoke in the morning, following his master Marshall, and agreed to the "amendment" of the veto power and the submission of the Korean question to the United Nations General Assembly for handling. He emphasized that the world "is tending towards division" and that "the Security Council has failed," intentionally creating the illusion of a "new world war" to deceive himself and others, in order to obtain solace for the current critical situation of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. In the afternoon of the same day, Vyshinsky delivered a long speech of one and a half hours, strongly exposing and criticizing all the conspiracies and crimes of American imperialism and international reactionaries, resolutely rejecting the US proposals for Korean "independence," amending the veto power, and establishing a "Provisional Committee on Peace and Security," and rebuking the "warmongers" in the United States for their hysteria and creation of international tensions.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 19th: TASS, New York, 17th: Upon arriving in New York, Soviet Chief Representative to the UN General Assembly, Vyshinsky, stated: The second UN General Assembly faces many important issues, which can only be fully resolved under one important condition: mutual respect, mutual understanding, goodwill, and a determination to strive for peace and security. We left the Soviet Union at a time when the Soviet people were celebrating the 800th anniversary of the founding of Moscow, which is a significant day. As our great leader and teacher Stalin said: Moscow is the vanguard in the struggle for lasting peace and international friendship, and the vanguard against new instigators of conflict. The Soviet delegation will do its utmost to accomplish this task.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 19th: New York dispatch: On the eve of the second United Nations General Assembly, American imperialism mobilized its public opinion to launch propaganda clamoring to undermine the United Nations, in order to achieve its goal of further aggression against the people of the world and capitalist countries. On the 14th, Marshall delivered a speech to the United Nations Association of the United States and other groups in New York, also openly exposing this conspiracy. Marshall scorned the United Nations, saying: "It would be a serious mistake to think that every international problem should be handed over to the United Nations to deal with. In fact, this is neither necessary nor practical." He demanded: "We must find ways to improve the procedures and organization of the United Nations itself." He openly abandoned the principle of unanimous agreement among the five major powers stipulated in the United Nations Charter, saying: "Regarding the issue of the veto power, the United States feels that a major change is needed." He also made excuses for the US intervention in the internal affairs of South, Bulgaria, and Albania in the Balkans, saying: "We have no other concern except to appease this region." Regarding the Palestinian issue, he also wanted to "achieve a unified solution" in accordance with the expansionist wishes of the United States. This lawless, arbitrary, and arrogant attitude of the US authorities has made the prospects for the recently opened United Nations General Assembly extremely bleak.

    第二届联合国大会揭幕
    美妄图破坏联合国宪章
    维辛斯基痛予呵斥
    断然拒绝修改否决权等建议
    【新华社陕北十八日电】纽约讯：第二届联合国大会已于十六日下午三时在纽约佛拉辛公园揭幕，与会五十五国代表约一千八百余人，当日举行两次会议，由巴西代表阿拉纳主席。大会选举了指导委员会委员，及其他六个小组委员会主席。苏、美、英、法、中（蒋）、巴西、波兰、智利，卢森堡、印度、纽西兰、墨西哥、古巴、叙利亚等十四个国当选指导委员会委员。卢森堡外长贝奇当选为政治安全小组委员会主席，智利驻联合国永久代表格鲁萨为经济财政小组委员会主席，波兰出席安理会代表兰吉为社会暨文化小组委员会主席，纽西兰驻美公使贝伦森为托管小组委员会主席，印度代表艾理为行政预算小组委员会主席，叙利亚出席联合国代表艾霍利为法律小组委员会主席，美、苏、英、法、中（蒋）等国代表七人被选为大会副主席。
    【新华社陕北二十日电】纽约讯：联合国大会于十七、十八两日继续举行会议，开始一般性之辩论。十七日之会中，马歇尔继墨西哥代表包德之后，发表冗长之演说。除重述其十四日在美国联合国同志会上之观点外，更充满了破坏联合国国宪章之精神，并企图把联合国变为美帝国主义扩张与侵略政策之御用机关。他强调否决权之“修改”与“限制使用”，他特别要废除对联合国宪章中第六条及第四条中否决权之使用。（按第六条为：“联合国之会员国中，有屡次违犯本宪章所载之原则者，大会经安全理事会之建议，得将其由本组织除名。”第四条中曾规定准许新会员国加入，“将由大会经安全理事会之推荐以决议行之”。）他并狂妄的提出在联合国大会下成立一个所谓“和平安全临时委员会”，阴谋以之代替安理会的实际工作。并建议大会将朝鲜问题列入议程。他甚至于把原子能的管制问题未获解决、裁军未能实施，都归咎于德日和约没有缔成，及苏联不同意美国独家控制原子能的计划所得。马氏演说后，波兰外长莫塞莱夫斯基强烈的抨击修改联合国宪章与否决权的企图。他说：“波兰将坚决反对一切分裂世界为敌对阵营的企图，和目前为某些强国所发动的违背波茨顿协议而复活德国侵略者的企图。”莫氏要求“外国撤退在希腊的军队，实行真正裁军。”十八日会议中，上午蒋代表王世杰演说，跟随其主子马歇尔之后，同意否决权之“修改”与朝鲜问题之提交联合国大会处理。他强调世界“趋向分裂”、“安理会失败”，有意制造一个“世界新战争”的幻觉，来自欺欺人，以为蒋家匪帮目下的危急处境取得慰藉。同日下午，维辛斯基发表一小时半之长篇演说，强烈揭露与抨击美帝国主义及国际反动派之一切阴谋与罪行，断然拒绝美国所提朝鲜“独立”、修改否决权及成立“和平安全临时委员会”等建议，呵斥美国国内“战争贩子”之歇斯的里和制造国际紧张局势。
    【新华社陕北十九日电】塔斯社纽约十七日讯：苏联联合国大会首席代表维辛斯基于到达纽约时发表谈话称：第二届联合国大会面临许多重大问题，这些问题只有在一个重要的条件下才能获得完满解决，这就是互相尊重，互相谅解，善意及为和平和安全而奋斗的决心。我们离开苏联时正值苏联人民庆祝莫斯科建城八百周年纪念，这是意义重大的一天。正如我们的伟大领袖和导师斯大林所说的：莫斯科是为永久和平和国际友谊而奋斗的先锋，是反对新的战斗鼓动者的先锋。苏联代表将全力以赴完成此一任务。
    【新华社陕北十九日电】纽约讯：当第二届联合国大会的前夕，美帝国主义动员其舆论发动破坏联合国的宣传叫嚣，以便达到其进一步侵略世界人民与资本主义各国的目的。十四日马歇尔在纽约向美国联合国同志会其他团体发表演说，亦公开暴露了此种阴谋。马氏蔑视联合国称：“如认为每一国际问题都应该交给联合国去处理，实乃做了一件严重的错事。事实上这是既不必要，又不实际的。”他要求：“必须设法改善联合国机构本身的程序和组织。”他公开背弃联合国宪章规定五强一致协议的原则称：“对于否决权问题，美国觉得需要一个重大的改变。”他又为美国在巴尔干干涉南、保、阿三国内政的行动找借口，说：“我们除了绥靖这个区域以外，并无别的关注。”对于巴勒斯坦问题，他也要按照美国扩张的愿望“取得一致的解决办法”。美国当局此种不守法纪的专横狂妄态度，已使最近开幕的联合国大会前途极为黯淡。
