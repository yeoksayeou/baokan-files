　　Dazhai Scientifically Organizes Labor, Reports Wheat Fields
　　Plows and Sows Immediately
　　Qiu County Issues 30 Million in Wheat Planting Loans
　　[Our reporters' group, 12th dispatch] Dazhai Village, Qiu County, uses scientific methods to utilize all labor, enabling each person to cultivate more land than before the war. The village lost more than two-fifths of its population during the war and famine. Before the war, each person cultivated an average of 7.5 mu of land, and one animal plowed 75 mu. Now, one animal plows an average of 106 mu, and one person cultivates 12 mu. According to common sense, it would be impossible to cultivate so much land. This year, the rain came late, the autumn harvest was delayed, and it coincided with wheat planting, making the peasants doubly busy. The village adopted the principle of "everything for increased agricultural production," scientifically utilizing all labor. It stipulates that cattle plow, harrow, and pull crops; men do heavy work; women feed cattle, cut grass, grind flour, and cut soybeans; and children do not have an autumn vacation, but are led by teachers to the fields to do various light tasks, receiving work points and tickets for their labor. Women and children replace the light work that previously required men and livestock, which is equivalent to the existing labor of sixty able-bodied men, and frees up thirty-four head of livestock for one-third of the time. Even with this organization of labor, it still cannot solve all the problems. The village further organizes land, with the masses reporting the wheat fields they will plant. The wheat fields are harvested early, plowed and sown immediately. In non-wheat fields, only the ears of corn and sorghum are harvested first, and the stalks are harvested after the wheat is planted. Carts are also organized to carry manure to the fields and haul crops back. Mutual aid teams uniformly mobilize labor, displaying the spirit of seizing and planting crops with armed force, completing two urgent tasks simultaneously. The village is currently engaged in a tense autumn harvest. It is estimated that more than 2,000 mu of autumn seedlings can be successfully harvested, and more than 1,400 mu of wheat land can be sown on time (Li Zhuang).
　　[Our reporters' group, 12th dispatch] The Qiu County Democratic Government issued 30 million in wheat planting loans to solve the difficulties faced by poor peasants in planting wheat, such as plowing cattle, fertilizer, and seeds. The main recipients of the loans are poor peasants (according to their pre-liberation status), with the principle of centralized use. The loan conditions are: (1) villages that suffered serious disasters in the past and whose autumn seedlings suffered poor harvests this wheat season; (2) villages with a particular shortage of livestock, fertilizer, and wheat seeds; (3) wheat-producing areas under the same conditions. The loan method must be specifically discussed by the farmers' association小组, and then approved by the village's farmers' congress, to ensure that the loans truly reach those who need them most (Li Zhuang).
　　[Our reporters' group, 12th dispatch] The lack of fertilizer is a major obstacle to increasing production in the plains. Due to the reduction of livestock and the lack of surplus capacity for peasants to purchase fertilizer, many areas apply less than half the fertilizer applied before the war. To alleviate this difficulty, the Qiu County Party Committee has issued a call to the entire county to accumulate fertilizer and increase production on a large scale for planting wheat. The first joint defense area of the first district of the county responded to the call, accumulating 3,845 large carts of green manure and 4,430 large carts of pen manure (excluding other ash soil piles and toilets) in the past two months, which can fertilize more than 10,000 mu of land. Nanliuzhuang, with a total of 308 people, under the leadership of labor hero Yuan Zhaolin, has accumulated 625 large carts of green manure and 80 large carts of pen manure. Fuxinzhuang has accumulated 550 large carts of green manure alone in two months. The mutual aid team (25 households) led by Zhou Yonghua in Xiangchenggu has accumulated 180 large carts of green manure. The masses are discussing it, saying, "The Yonghua team doesn't have to worry about planting wheat." The mutual aid group led by Zhao Shuzeng built three pigsties, producing an average of one large cart of manure every three days. The Ding Xiuwen team sweeps locust flowers and dirt from the roads, accumulating one large cart of fertilizer a day. Liu Qingxian gets up early and goes to bed late, sweeping soil and picking up watermelon rinds at the market, accumulating one large cart of fertilizer every three days. Xiangchenggu village has added 32 new pigsties and built 22 new manure pits. In the past two months, the entire village has accumulated 3,471 large carts of fertilizer (Zhu Bo).
　　[Our newspaper, Jinnan, 13th dispatch] Using facts to mobilize the masses, Xiangchenggu in the first district of Qiu County reclaimed wasteland and expanded the wheat planting area by 80 mu. The village's production committee studied how to lead the masses in reclaiming wasteland. Labor hero Ding Zichen said, "Our group reclaimed four mu of wasteland last year and planted 1,000 watermelon seedlings. Each seedling could be sold for 200 yuan, totaling 200,000 yuan. This spring, our group reclaimed another six mu and is preparing to plant wheat, which has already been plowed twice." After he finished speaking, everyone said, "The masses love to hear facts the most. Let's use this example to mobilize the masses." Subsequently, a mass meeting was held in the evening. Ding Zichen told the masses about the achievements of his group in reclaiming wasteland. The masses heard that reclaiming wasteland had great benefits and gained confidence in reclaiming wasteland. Within 20 days after the meeting, each mutual aid group reclaimed 64.5 mu of wasteland, and unorganized masses such as Wang Aichen reclaimed 6 mu of wasteland, and Han Chunshan and others reclaimed 13 mu of virgin wasteland. The whole town reclaimed a total of 83 mu of virgin and cultivated wasteland.
　　[Our newspaper, Jinnan, 12th dispatch] When the masses in Nanliu Village, first district of Qiu County, discussed the autumn harvest and wheat planting plan, Zhang Qingyuan said: "It's easy to make a plan, but it's hard to catch mole crickets. If we don't catch all the mole crickets, the wheat will be eaten by them for nothing!" Everyone was worried about this problem. The following solutions were discussed: (1) When Zhang Qingxiu planted radishes, he rubbed the seeds with dry tobacco, and none were eaten. He also planted 16 radishes that were not rubbed with dry tobacco, and eight were eaten by mole crickets. Rubbing with dry tobacco is indeed effective. Just rub two to three jin of tobacco for every 100 jin of wheat. (2) Fry the flower seeds until dry, grind them into flour, and mix them with the wheat before sowing them into the ground. Not only can they cure mole crickets, but they can also be used as fertilizer. The more flower seeds mixed, the better.

　　大寨科学组织劳力自报麦地
  　随收随犁随种
  　邱县发放种麦贷款三千万
    【本报记者团十二日电】邱县大寨村以科学运用一切劳力的方法，使每个人的耕地面积超过战前。该村在战争和灾荒中，减少人口五分之二强，战前每人平均种七亩半地，一个牲口耕七十五亩，现在一个牲口平均耕一百零六亩、一个人种十二亩，照一般常理讲，无论如何种不过来。今年落雨晚，秋收迟，和种麦搅在一起，农民倍形忙碌。村上采取“一切为了农业增产”的方针，科学运用一切劳力，规定牛只犁地、耙地、拉庄稼，男人作重活，妇女喂牛、割草、推磨、割豆子，儿童不放秋假，由先生率领着到田里作各种轻活，同样计工得工票，妇女儿童代替了过去非用男人和牲畜不可的轻活，其作用相当于现有的六十个男整劳力，并腾出卅四头牲畜，三分之一的时间。这样组织劳力，还不能解决全部问题，又进一步组织地亩，由群众自报种麦地，种麦地早收，随收随犁随种，非种麦地中的玉茭高粱先只收穗，等种完麦再收杆；大车也组织起来，去地里时捎粪，回来拉庄稼。互助大队统一调动劳力，拿出武装抢收抢种的精神，同时完成两个紧迫任务。现该村正在紧张秋收，估计两千多亩秋苗能顺利收回，一千四百多亩麦地也能按时下种（李庄）
    【本报记者团十二日电】邱县民主政府，以三千万种麦贷款，解决贫苦农民种麦中耕牛、肥料、种籽等困难。贷款主要对象为贫农（按未翻身前的成份），以集中使用为原则，借贷条件：（一）过去灾荒严重及今年麦季秋苗欠收的村庄；（二）牲口、肥料、麦种特别缺乏的村庄；（三）在同样条件下的产麦区。借贷方式一定经农会小组具体讨论，再经全村农民大会通过，以保证贷款真正落到最需要者的手中。（李庄）
    【本报记者团十二日电】肥料缺乏，为平原增产一主要障碍。由于牲畜减少及农民尚无余力购买肥料，许多地区施肥不足战前二分之一。邱县县委为解除这一困难，大量种麦特向全县发出积肥增产的号召，该县一区第一联防响应号召，两个月来增沤青肥三千八百四十五大车，积圈粪四千四百三十大车（其他灰土堆、厕所不在内），可上地万余亩。南刘庄共三百零八人，在劳动英雄袁兆林领导下，已沤青肥六百二十五大车，圈粪八十大车。傅辛庄在两个月内，仅青肥就沤了五百五十大车。香城固周永华领导的互助大队（二十五户），沤青肥一百八十大车，群众议论纷纷：“永华大队里，种麦可不要愁了。”赵书增领导的互助组，修了三个猪圈，平均三天出一大车粪。丁秀文大队扫槐花和道土，一天沤一大车。刘清贤早起晚睡，在集上扫土、拾西瓜皮，三天可沤一大车肥。香城固村新添猪圈三十二个，新修粪坑二十二个，两个月来全村已积肥三千四百七十一大车。（朱波）
    【本报冀南十三日电】用实事动员群众，邱县一区香城固，开荒扩大种麦面积八十亩。该村生委会，研究如何领导群众开荒，劳英丁自辰说：“俺组去年开荒四亩，种了一千棵西瓜，每棵能卖洋二百元，共计二十万元，今春俺组又开荒六亩，准备种麦，现已犁了两遍”。讲完后大家都说：“群众最爱听实事，就拿这个例子，动员群众吧。”随于晚上开了群众大会，丁自辰把他组开荒成绩说了一遍，群众听到开荒利益很大，都有了开荒的信心。会后二十天内，各互助组开荒六十四亩半，无组织的群众王爱臣开荒六亩、韩春山等三人开生荒十三亩，全镇共开生熟荒八十三亩。
    【本报冀南十二日电】邱县一区南刘村群众，讨论秋收种麦计划时，张庆元说：“计划好订，蛄蝼难拿，不把蛄蝼捉净，麦子出来也得叫它吃了白费劲！”大家都担心这一着，讨论有以下办法：（一）张庆修种萝卜时，把籽用旱烟搓了一下，一棵也没吃，又种了没搓旱烟的十六棵，被蛄蝼吃了八棵，用旱烟搓了确实有效，一百斤麦子，搓二斤到三斤烟就行。（二）把花籽炒干，轧成面，与麦子搅拌在一块下到地里，不但能治蛄蝼，还可当肥料，花籽搅的越多越好。
