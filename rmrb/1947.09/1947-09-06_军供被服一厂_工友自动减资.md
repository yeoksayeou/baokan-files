　　Military Supply Clothing Factory No. 1
  　Workers Voluntarily Reduce Wages
    [Our Newspaper] Military Supply Clothing Factory No. 1 has spontaneously launched a movement to reduce wages and support the front lines. First, Comrade Zhang Deshun, a repair machine worker, proposed: "Earning more wages means spending more, which is a waste. I voluntarily reduce my repair machine wages by one-third to give to the soldiers on the front lines." At the same time, Comrade Yang Jinyuan submitted a written proposal: "The brave men on the front lines are not afraid of bloodshed and sacrifice as they fight against the bandit Chiang. They are much more hardworking than us workers. I request a reduction in my wages to support the front lines." After these suggestions were made, the factory immediately used a mobile bulletin to broadcast them throughout the factory. Workers in the workshops, holding scissors and stepping on machines, discussed them incessantly. Tailoring workers said, "We cannot lag behind in supporting the front lines. For every set of cotton-padded clothes we tailor, we will reduce three liang of rice." The leader of Group Six, Comrade Lu Jinhai, took the lead by reporting the amount of wages they were willing to reduce to the factory. Comrade Li Shouyuan, who had just returned from the embroidery factory in a nearby village, also proposed, "Reduce one and a half liang for sewing sleeves." The news of the enthusiastic wage reductions was broadcast, causing a sensation throughout the factory. Machine Groups Four, Seven, and Five immediately proposed agreeing to Group Six's suggestion of reducing nine liang of rice per set. Temporary worker Comrade Yang Changhao also proposed, "Reduce two liang of rice for each cotton hat." Group Leader of Group Three, Comrade Liu Haishun, said, "There are also surpluses in the cost of machine parts and auxiliary materials, so reduce one and a half liang of rice each. And save the monthly magazine fee of fifty yuan." The wave of enthusiasm for supporting the front lines rose higher and higher. Female worker representative Comrade Li Jinzhen also immediately proposed, "Our female workers cannot lag behind either. Reduce one liang of rice for each buttonhole." Administrative cadres then proposed, "Reduce one jin of rice from the daily meals as well." The entire movement to reduce wages and support the front lines spread to every corner in less than a day. The entire factory unanimously agreed to start reducing wages from September 1st. According to the estimated production volume for July, the factory can reduce wages by 4.8 million yuan per month in the future. (Ge Qin)
    [Our Newspaper] Military Supply Clothing Factory No. 4, after three months of rectification and ideological education, is now unprecedentedly active. All employees, under the slogan of "Seeing who is better in August" and "Performing meritorious service in the Great Counteroffensive," launched the "August Great Competition" movement. In the past half-month, the morale of the employees has soared, and productivity has increased by 50% to 100%. After tailor Liu Tonglu broke the record of tailoring 180 ordinary cotton-padded clothes per day, Song Qiucheng immediately caught up with 200 pieces, and Zong Zhande reached 180 pieces of old linings. Union Chairman Liu Mingshan refused to accept defeat and immediately tailored 220 pieces. The comrades in the machine group worked even harder. Guo Senlin and Tian Zhaozhe increased their production of ordinary cotton-padded clothes from 10 sets to 15 sets per day. Wang Fazhi and Yang Yonglu produced 20 sets in one go. Comrade Guo Shouwen, upon hearing this, made up his mind and immediately caught up with 23 sets. Case worker Wang Yuanzhi buttoned 80 sets of cotton-padded clothes a day, plus worked overtime wrapping thread for two and a half ma, working until almost the rooster crowed, and was still the first to go to work the next day. The achievements of the dyeing group are even more amazing. In order to supply the tailoring, they increased their daily dyeing from 21,000 square feet to 39,000 square feet. Du Yunxi once stayed up all night, grinding out more than 20,000 square feet of cloth by himself, ensuring "no delay for the tailors." During the intense competition, the workers of Factory No. 4 also spontaneously launched an enthusiastic donation movement. Group leader Wang Qihou and Ban Xueli took the lead, donating 3,000 yuan each month until Chiang Kai-shek was defeated. Union Deputy Director Shen Chunxi then signed up, donating 4,500 yuan each month. Since then, the movement has spread throughout the factory, with everyone vying to sign up. More than 90% of the comrades in the entire factory have signed up. According to current statistics, the total amount of donations from August to December is 600,000 yuan. (Shu Gong)
