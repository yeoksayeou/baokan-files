　　A New Family
　　Implementing Reward Measures Leads to Active Production Throughout the Family
　　[Our Jinnan Dispatch, 6th] Han Mengchang, a villager from Zhao Family Village in the Third District of Hengshui, has seen a significant increase in the production enthusiasm of his entire family since implementing family production reward measures. Especially his eldest son, Dianbo (16 years old), is the most active. He not only earned the glorious title of "Model" at home but also received high praise among the masses. His west neighbor, Bao Ren, said, "Old Sanzi (Dianbo's nickname) is truly active. He doesn't rest at noon, gets up early, and goes to bed late, plowing two more acres of land every day." Dianbo also collects more than a hundred catties of firewood every day, voluntarily proposing "I don't want any money for any work I do," earning praise from the whole family. During this manure accumulation period, he was the first to dig the manure pit, throwing wheat stalks, wormwood, rotten grass, and messy firewood into it. He carried water to pour into it morning and evening. In just four or five days, he accumulated half a pit of manure, preparing to apply one and a half to two cartloads of manure per acre when planting wheat. His actions influenced Bao Qin and Shuang Zheng in the east neighborhood and Bao Ren in the west neighborhood. Each family also dug a manure pit, getting up exceptionally early in the morning, returning at noon without resting, busy with fermenting manure and other tasks, and returning only when the sun set in the evening, plowing up to four acres of land each day.

　　一个新家庭
  　实行奖励办法全家积极生产
    【本报冀南六日电】衡水三区赵家庄村民韩梦长，自实行家庭生产奖励办法后，全家生产积极性大大提高，尤其是它大儿殿博（十六岁）最积极，不仅在家里得了“模范”的光荣称号，且在群众当中也得到很好的赞誉，西邻居保任说：“老三子（殿博外号）真积极，晌午不歇晌，起的早，睡的晚，每天多耕二亩地。”殿博每天还拾一百多斤柴，自动提出“做啥活也不要钱”，博得全家表扬。这次积肥时，他首先把粪坑刨好，把麦秸、蒿草、烂草、乱柴等东西扔到粪坑里；早晚担水往里泼，四、五天功夫就积了半坑粪，准备种麦时，每亩上一车半至两车粪。他这一做，把东邻的保钦、双正，西邻的保任他们都影响起来了。每家也挖了一个粪坑，早晨起得特别早，晌午回来不歇晌，忙着沤粪等生活，晚上太阳落了才回来，每天耕地达四亩。
