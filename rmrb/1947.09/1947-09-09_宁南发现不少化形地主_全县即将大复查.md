(Reported by our newspaper from Jinnan, 7th) Ningnan is preparing for a county-wide re-examination. The county undertook a large-scale land reform movement last year, and this year's re-examination reveals that the leadership, in the process of settling accounts, emphasized land and undervalued housing, neglected the importance of recovering hidden wealth, and did not follow the principle of "leaving living expenses before settling accounts," which constrained the initiative of the masses and failed to satisfy the demands of poor peasants. Recently, the masses, through comparing land, houses, and living standards, discovered that the elimination of landlords in various villages was not thorough enough. Based on a survey of only 65 villages, among 365 landlord households and 188 rich peasant households, many were not thoroughly struggled against. Specifically, 56 landlord households and 132 rich peasant households escaped the net without being struggled against. Therefore, the masses are demanding a continued and thorough settling of accounts. The county committee valued the enthusiasm of the masses and convened a county and district cadres' meeting, which lasted 11 days. It was unanimously agreed to strike while the iron is hot and decided to designate the seventh day of the seventh lunar month as "Turning Over Day," on which the entire county would take action simultaneously. Every landlord, whether they slipped through the net or were not thoroughly struggled against, regardless of gender, would be brought to account without exception. Secondly, after the landlords are apprehended, 5,000 poor peasant men and women members will be given concentrated training in separate zones throughout the county. The training will address the following issues: 1. Reviewing the targets of struggle and determining their severity. 2. Employing the poor and allowing them to take charge. 3. Discussing how to further mobilize the masses and adopting a policy of education and transformation towards capitalist elements. 4. Consolidating village organizations by investigating class backgrounds and ideologies. Thirdly, in the distribution of gains, land will be leveled according to quality, houses will be valued and compensated to households and individuals, and hidden wealth will first be used to solve the issue of production tools for poor peasants and satisfy their demands. Single men will receive more, and children and unmarried daughters will also receive their share. Middle peasants will receive less. The method of distribution is that the masses will first compare each other, determine grades through comparison, and then value and allocate shares according to individuals and households. Fourthly, strengthen ideological mobilization, establish and cultivate poor peasant backbones, promote them step by step, prevent disunity between old and new organizations, the separation of middle and poor peasants, and pay attention to thrift and not delaying agricultural work.

　　宁南发现不少化形地主
  　全县即将大复查
    【本报冀南七日电】宁南准备全县齐复查。该县去年大动，与今年复查，因领导上在清算中重地轻房，忽视要浮财与先留生活后清算之偏向，束缚了群众自动性，未满足贫农要求。最近群众从比地、比房、比生活中发现各村地主消灭都不彻底，特别不少化形地主，逃避了清算，仅据六十五村调查，地主三六五户，富农一八八户，均未斗透，就有地主五十六户，富农一三二户，漏网未斗。因之，群众要求继续彻底清算。县委会珍贵群众热情，召开县区干部大会，历时十一日，一致同意趁热打铁，当决定阴历七月七日为翻身日，是日全县一齐动手。说扣一扣，无论漏网或未斗透地主，不问男女，一个不留。第二、将地主扣起后，全县分区集训五千个贫男女会员。集训中解决以下问题：一、审查斗争对象，决定轻重。二、雇贫要当家。三、讨论如何深入发动及对走资分子采教育改造方针。四、从查阶级查思想中整理村组织。第三、分配果实上，土地按质量推平，房屋作价按户按人填补，浮财先解决贫农生产工具，满足贫农要求。独身汉多分，小孩闺女也得分，中农少分，分法是群众先互相比，从比中定等，而后作价，按人按户填分。第四、加强思想发动，树立培养贫农骨干，要步步提升，防止新老组织不团结，中贫农分家，并注意节约及不误农时。
