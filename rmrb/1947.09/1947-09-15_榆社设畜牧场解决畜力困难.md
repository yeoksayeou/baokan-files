　　Yu She Establishes Livestock Farm to Solve Draft Animal Shortage
    [This newspaper's Yu She report] After the land reform in Yu She, the leadership discovered a general lack of draft animals among the poor peasants. In order to carry out the large-scale production movement on an even greater scale, overcome the difficulties faced by the peasants after their emancipation regarding draft animals, and better achieve prosperity, the Yu She County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the County Government have specially decided to allocate one million local currency to establish livestock farms in Guo Jia Shan in the Third District and Dong Ying in the First District. These farms will specialize in raising livestock and plan to buy fifty head of cattle. The majority of these will be calves born within the last year, and after being raised through this winter, they will be able to serve as draft animals next year. Thirty-two calves have already been purchased. The masses are reflecting, saying: "The government truly cares about us; it truly is a government of the peasants." (Zi Wen, Fu Lin)
