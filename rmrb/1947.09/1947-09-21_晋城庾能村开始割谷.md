    Harvesting Begins in Yuneng Village, Jincheng
    [This newspaper, Taiyue, 19th] Yuneng Village in Jincheng started harvesting grain on the 12th, following the plan of harvesting each ripe plot as it comes. All 230 men and women in the village, plus able-bodied laborers and 40 children, were divided into groups to harvest in the fields, carrying manure on the way there and grain on the way back, according to the original plan. In one day, they harvested over 200 mu of grain, carried 104 loads of thatched manure, 25 carts of pen manure, and 200 *dan* of grain because of the grain.
    [This newspaper, Wu'an] On September 10th, the 7th District held a meeting of village cadres, with a total of 115 people attending. The main content of the meeting was to inspect manure accumulation and discuss the autumn harvest, autumn plowing, and wheat planting plan. The current situation seen during the inspection is that the fields have been hoed three times. Manure accumulation from August 30th to September 10th, a period of ten days, based on statistics from Yangyi, Berlin, Xiaodian benchmark, and Guantao villages alone: a total of 256,800 *tuo* of manure has been accumulated. All villages in the district have reached the original plan of 15 *tuo* per *mu* for the masses' land and 20 *tuo* per *mu* for land belonging to families of revolutionary soldiers and martyrs. Some villages that lacked manure supplemented it with *Jingzi* branches. Because this year's planting was late and the autumn harvest is late, to plant all the *Laozhi* wheat, it is feared that the labor and animal power will not be enough. Therefore, before the autumn harvest, villages should intercrop wheat in the small cornfields and late millet fields where the seedlings are insufficient. According to statistics from the four villages in Xinghua, a total of 1,000 *mu* have been intercropped with wheat. In terms of the autumn harvest, autumn plowing, and wheat planting, the villages have generally divided it into four stages: (1) From the 28th day of the seventh lunar month to the 8th day of the eighth lunar month, deliver manure and intercrop wheat. (2) From the 8th day of the eighth lunar month to the 18th day of the eighth lunar month, harvest early-maturing crops, harvesting and planting as they go. (3) From the 18th day of the eighth lunar month to the 28th day of the eighth lunar month, carry out a concentrated autumn harvest and plant large quantities of wheat. (4) From the 28th day of the eighth lunar month to the 12th day of the ninth lunar month, complete the autumn harvest, plant wheat, plow autumn fields before the frost, and turn to mutual aid transportation, spinning, weaving, and large-scale gleaning. The entire district plans to plant wheat on more than 60 percent of the land, with Yangyi, Berlin, and Xiaodian benchmark alone planting 20,220 *mu* of wheat.

    晋城庾能村开始割谷
    【本报太岳十九日电】晋城庾能村按照熟一块割一块的计划，于十二日开始割谷，全村二百三十个男女，全劳力和四十个儿童分组到地割谷，并按原订计划去时捎粪回时捎谷，一天即割谷二百余亩，捎去茅粪一百零四担、圈粪二十五车，担因谷二百个。
    【本报武安讯】九月十日七区召开村干部会议，共到会人数一百一十五人，会议内容：主要为检查积肥，讨论秋收秋耕种麦计划。检查中看出的目前情况是三遍地都已锄完，积肥从八月三十日到九月十日，十天时间，仅据阳邑、柏林、小店基点、官陶村统计：共积肥二十五万六千八百驮。全区各村都已达到原订计划，群众地每亩十五驮，抗属地每亩二十驮，有的村粪土不足，也以荆子补齐，因为今年种地迟，收秋晚，要全部种上老直麦，恐怕劳动畜力顾不住，所以各村在秋收前，要在小玉茭地、不够苗的晚谷地串麦子。杏花村四村统计，共串麦千亩，在秋收秋耕种麦上，各村大体上划分了四个阶段：（一）阴历七月二十八至八月初八，送粪串麦。（二）八月初八至八月十八割早熟庄稼，随割随种。（三）八月十八至八月二十八，突击收秋，大量种麦。（四）八月二十八至九月十二日，霜降前完成秋收、种麦秋耕地、转向互助运输、纺织大拾砍。全区计划种麦在百分之六十以上，光阳邑、柏林、小店基点，就要种麦二万零二百二十亩。
