    Jide Village Completes Grain Harvest in Three-Day Blitz
    Simultaneously Hauling Manure
    Women in Shahe Putongdian Village Go to the Fields to Accelerate Autumn Harvest
    [Reported by this newspaper from Taiyue on the 23rd] Jide Village, in the Sixth District of Yangcheng, mobilized the entire village and harvested 1,878 mu of grain in three days. Before the harvest, the village production committee proposed the slogan of "three aspects and four finenesses" at the squad leader meeting: "participate in the war on one hand, harvest the autumn crops on the other, make fertilizer on the other, and harvest finely, thresh finely, store finely, and eat sparingly." All 704 men, women, and semi-laborers in the village, as well as various work cadres, went to the fields to harvest grain, hauling branches and transporting manure at the same time. Within three days, they harvested all 1,878 mu of grain, transported 1,107 loads of manure, cut 1,155 branches, and smoked 48 something. Zhang Xiaonian, a 66-year-old man, said to the instructor, "I have never seen this in my long life. In the past, we had to get up early and work late just to harvest grain for half a month. Now we can harvest it in three days without being in a hurry, and also cut branches and transport manure. What is the reason for this?" The instructor said, "In the past, we were not organized. Now all the men, women, children, and old men in the village are organized, so the power is great. This is called organization is better than machines." The village is now threshing, cutting branches, and transporting manure, and guarantees to bring the grain home in four days.
    [Reported by this newspaper from Shahe] The autumn harvest movement in Putongdian Village, in the Sixth District of Shahe, started vigorously on July 28th of the lunar calendar and by August 4th, the grain had already been harvested. Due to rain, one and a half days were lost in the middle, and the busy time was only five days. The autumn harvest this year was twice as fast as in previous years. The main reason is the universal organization of auxiliary labor forces such as women and children. Of the 382 female laborers in the village, 260 participated in the autumn harvest, accounting for nearly 70% of the total labor force. This number freed up a large number of male laborers to carry crop stubble and plow the land early, and ensured the planting of more than 2,700 mu of timely wheat. In the past, women never worked in the stubble fields, and even raking the stubble was rare (they all used large hoes. Raking the stubble was necessary because the water fields needed to be leveled for planting, so after the stubble was there, they also used bamboo to rake it out). This year, because the masses have been liberated and are laboring for themselves on their own land for the first time, especially since they are organized, not only most of the women are raking the stubble, but many people are also participating in the stubble field work. Zhi'e, Rong'e, Xiuzhi, Tong'e, etc., are not slower than men. The main experiences in mobilizing and organizing female labor to participate in the autumn harvest are as follows: 1. Overcoming the idea of underestimating women's abilities. The women's chairman and group leader Rongzhi led her group to the field on the first day. In the first half of the day, nine people harvested eight mu of grain, and in the second half of the day, seven people harvested two mu of grain and pulled one mu of sesame. They said to the men, "Who said that we women can't do it? We are no slower than you." Practical actions broke the men's underestimation of women's abilities. 2. Merit Campaign and Cadre Leadership: The women in Dongjie won the flag for catching insects, which inspired the enthusiasm of the women in each street. Each street conducted challenges, vying to win merits and flags in the autumn harvest movement. The women's chairman played a great role in taking the lead in promoting each group. 3. Solving Specific Difficulties: For example, the original women's spinning groups were sometimes not compatible with the men's mutual aid groups, which was very inconvenient for work. Adjustments were made first, and the women participated in the autumn harvest according to the men's mutual aid groups. Some still had to spin at night, so they remained in the old groups. Every evening, the men assigned what work was to be done each day, specifying which field to go to tomorrow and what work to do. Some men were assigned to work with them to guide them. Old people or children with children took care of them. 4. Equivalent Exchange and Wage Issues: Work was evaluated and wages were set according to the actual performance of each day. Zhao Xiu's group in Xijie and Zhang Ming's group in Beijie implemented a contract system based on land area. How much land, how many work points the men got, and how much wages were paid, and let the women harvest. They could send as many people as they wanted, which also improved the enthusiasm of the female labor force. After being liberated, everyone was even happier working together. They laughed and talked, comparing the past and the present, and became more and more energetic. After the movement started, the women's group leaders said, "It is easier to engage in mutual aid this autumn. Everyone is working hard, and no one is difficult to lead." The men reflected, "In previous years, there were a few women in the fields, but not like this year." Because of the benefits gained from mutual aid, they also naturally helped each other with scattered household chores, such as carrying water, picking up manure, and carrying fertilizer.

    吉德全村三天突击
    割完谷子捎带送粪
    沙河普通店妇女下地加速完成收秋
    【本报太岳二十三日电】阳城六区吉德村全村总动员，三天割完一千八百七十八亩谷。收割前，该村生产委员在分队长会议上提出：一面参战、一面收秋、一面造肥和细收、细打、细藏、细吃的“三面四细”口号，全村男女全半劳力及各种工作干部七百零四人，完全上地动手割谷，捎着利圪枝、运粪，三天内把一千八百七十八亩谷全部割完，并捎带运粪一千一百零七担，刹圪枝一千一百五十五个，还熏了四十八个圪＠。六十六岁的老汉张小年向指导员说：“我活这大年纪没见过，过去起早搭黑光割谷就得半个月，现在不慌不忙三天就割完，还刹圪枝运粪，这是甚道理？”指导员说：“过去没组织起来，现在全村的男女儿童老汉都组织起来，所以力量大，这就叫组织起来顶机器。”该村现正在打场、刹圪枝、运粪，并保证四天把谷收回家里。
    【本报沙河讯】沙河六区普通店村秋收运动，于旧历七月二十八日开始大动起来到八月初四日，谷子已经割完了。中间因下雨还误了一天半，大忙的时间不过五天，今年秋天比往年收割就快了一倍，最主要的原因普遍的组织了妇女儿童等辅助劳力，全村三百八十二个妇女劳力，参加秋收的就有二百六十个，占总劳力百分之七十弱。从这个数腾出了大批的男劳力，进行搬运庄茬和早犁地，并保证了种二千七百多亩应时麦子。过去妇女就没有在过茬子，就是搂茬的也很少（都是用大锄，搂茬是因为水地需要弄平方好种，故茬子有了以后，还用竹子搂出来），今年因为群众翻了身，第一次在自己土地上给自己劳动，特别是又组织起来，不但大部妇女都搂茬子，还有不少的人也参加了城茬。芝的、荣的、秀芝、同的等，都比男人还不慢。发动和组织妇女劳力参加秋收的主要经验如下：一、克服轻看妇女思想，妇女主席和小组长荣芝带领着她组，头一天下地，前半天九个人做了八亩谷，后半天七个人一晌割了二亩谷，还拔了一亩芝麻，她们向男人说：“谁说俺妇女不能干？比你们干的也不慢。”实际行动打破了男人的轻看思想。二、立功运动和干部带头：东街妇女打虫夺了旗，把各街妇女的劲儿都激起来，各街进行挑战，要在秋收运动中争相立功夺旗，妇女主席则是好带头推动各组，作用很大。三、解决具体困难问题：如原来的妇女纺花小组，有的和男人互助组不碰，做起活来很不方便，先作了调剂，妇女们都按男人的互助组参加秋收，晚上有的还要纺花，就仍按旧组。做啥活每天黄昏由男人们分派，指定明天到那块地里是什么活，有的是派一个男人和他们在一块指导他们，有小孩的老人或儿童给看。四、等价交换和工资问题：按每天的实际成绩评议订工，西街赵秀的组和北街张命的组，实行了按地包工办法，多少地，男人们得几个工，就出多少工资，让妇女割，她们愿意去几人就去几人，这样还提高了妇女劳力的积极性。翻了身，大家在一起做活就更加高兴，她们说笑谈论对比过去和现在，越干越有劲儿。运动起来以后，妇女小组长们说：“今年秋天搞互助可省事，都干的急，没一个人难领导。”男人们反映说：“往年有几个妇女下地，可没象今年这个样。”由于互助中得到利益，她们在家庭零星活上也自然的互助起来，如抬水、拾粪、抬肥等。
