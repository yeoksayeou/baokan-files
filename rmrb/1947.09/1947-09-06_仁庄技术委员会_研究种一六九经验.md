The Ren Zhuang Technical Committee
Studies Planting Experience of One-Six-Nine Wheat Variety

[Our newspaper's Licheng News] Shen Yuqin, the labor hero of Ren Zhuang Village, Second District, seized the season and convened a technical committee to study the main aspects of land cultivation and soil fertilizer, etc., to overcome the "innate" claims and conservative thinking of a few farmers, and used factual comparisons to promote One-Six-Nine wheat. Based on the different yields at this year's wheat harvest, the research shows that the One-Six-Nine wheat variety has the following experiences: 1. The soil should be red soil and sunny land (tight but good soil). It is not suitable for white soil or shady land (loose soil, does not grow well), or low-lying, damp land in river gullies (prone to damage and yellowing, without grains). 2. Apply more fertilizer, especially "hot" fertilizer, such as sheep manure, mule and horse manure, and oil cakes, especially cotton seeds, because "One-Six-Nine" has less "hot" properties than ordinary wheat, and is not suitable for pig manure or night soil, as these fertilizers are too "yin" (cold). 3. In terms of cultivation, wheat seeds are suitable for growing in raw soil. Plow deeply when plowing the second time. If it is ordinary land, turn over the raw soil on one side and expose the soil to the sun on the other. It is even better to use soil to level the ground. The ridges should be wide, or spaced apart. Sowing should be sparser, half a jin less per mu than ordinary wheat; only five jin is enough. 4. It is advisable to sow early, as its nature is slow and late-maturing, about six or seven days earlier or later than ordinary wheat. The above experience has been practically tried by Shen Zhuqin and Shen Xiao and other ten households, and planted in the same piece of land as ordinary wheat, yielding two to three dou (market dou) more per mu, and some yielding as much as seven large dou per mu. Those that do not meet the above conditions will have the same yield as other local wheat, or at least the yield will not be reduced. People have eaten One-Six-Nine wheat themselves, and whether it is used for noodles or steamed buns, there is nothing to complain about, it is the same as local wheat, only a few people say that the yield is not much. Using factual and technical comparisons, the main factors were found, and the "innate" claims and conservative thinking were overcome. Currently, each group has statistics, with a total of 540 mu of wheat land. Except for a few white soil and shady land on the mountains, 382 mu of wheat land are planted with One-Six-Nine.

　　仁庄技术委员会
  　研究种一六九经验
    【本报黎城讯】二区仁庄村劳动英雄申玉芹抓紧季节，召开技术委员会，研究土地耕作与土质肥料等等主要环节，克服少数农民的“天生”说法和守旧思想，用事实对比来推广一六九小麦。根据今年麦收时的收量不同，研究出麦种一六九有以下几点经验：一、土质要种到红土地，照阳地（土性紧中好地）。不宜白土、背阴地（土性松不长），河沟下湿地（怕长坏生黄不见籽）。二、多上肥料，要上有火性肥，如羊肥、骡马肥、油饼，特别是棉花籽更好，因“一六九”比一般小麦火性少，不宜使猪肥、圊肥、这些肥阴性大。三、在耕作上，麦籽宜长生土、耕二犁时要深，如一般地，一面翻动生土，一面照阳土壤，挑土垫地更好。垅得宽，或隔垅均可。下种宜稀一些，比一般麦每亩少种半斤；只用五斤即行。四、时间宜早种，他的性质笨，迟熟，和一般麦差前差后六七天的样子。以上经验，有申竹芹和申小的等十余户实际试用过，和一般麦同样种植在一块地，每亩多收二斗至三斗（市斗），每亩收到七大斗的也有。不合以上条件者，收成和其他土麦是同样，至少收成是不能减低。一六九麦都亲身吃过，不论拉面条和蒸馍，没有啥说，和土麦一样，只有少数人说收成不多。用了事实和技术对比，找到主要因素，克服了“天生”说法和守旧思想。现各组统计，共麦地五百四十亩，除了少数山上白土和阴背地外，三百八十二亩麦地都种一六九。（仁庄通讯组王顺庆）
