Xinhua News Agency, Jinji Luyu, 31st: Belated news: The Chiang bandits dug up and destroyed the Qin River dam, a tributary of the Yellow River, flooding the liberated areas of northern Henan. On the 12th, more than a hundred Chiang soldiers who re-occupied Muluandian, a new city in Wuzhi, northern Henan, launched a surprise attack on the Dafan Dam on the Qin River in Wuzhi on the 14th, dispersing our workers who were repairing the dam. They extensively destroyed the dam, which was about to be completed, expanding the breach to more than fifty zhang, and the floodwaters rushed towards the area east of Xiaogao in the liberated area. Currently, more than twenty villages in Wuzhi and some villages in Xiuwu County have been submerged. According to an investigation by the local democratic government, in Dafan and Fucun alone, more than 970 houses were destroyed, and 1,400 mu of land were destroyed in Dafan village alone. In order to cover up and frame the blame, the Chiang bandits have been fabricating "Communist troops destroyed the Qin River dam" through the Central News Agency for days. Everyone knows that except for the Chiang army, which is trapped in the isolated city of Muluandian, the rest are liberated areas. How could the People's Liberation Army breach the dam and flood itself? Their conspiracy of spitting blood on others collapses by itself. Currently, the democratic governments of Wuzhi and other places in northern Henan are leading the people of the whole county to bravely rush to block the breach and distribute relief grain and money. People in non-disaster areas are also warmly comforting and resettling refugees in disaster areas. Note: The Dafan Dam on the Qin River was breached by Chiang bandits' 97th Army under the pretext of "blocking the Japanese寇" in the early stage of the War of Resistance Against Japan, and it has not been repaired for several years. It was not until the People's Liberation Army recovered Muluandian last time that construction began on July 25th to block the gap. By the 14th of this month, more than 130 zhang of the 160 zhang breach had been repaired.

　　蒋贼悍然决溃沁河堤
  　武陟修武人民罹浩劫
    【新华社晋冀鲁豫三十一日电】迟到消息：蒋贼掘毁黄河支流之一的沁河堤坝，水淹豫北解放区。十二日再度侵占豫北武陟新城木栾店之蒋军百余，十四日奔袭武陟沁河大樊堤，驱散我正在抢修该堤之工人，将即可竣工之堤坝大肆掘毁，使该堤缺口扩大到五十余丈，洪水滔滔奔向解放区小高以东地区。现武陟二十余村及修武等县一部村庄，已遭淹没。据当地民主政府调查，仅大樊、富村即冲毁民房九百七十多间、单大樊村一地毁地千四百亩。蒋贼为掩饰及嫁祸，连日由中央社捏造“共军破毁沁河堤”。尽人皆知，蒋军除困守木栾店孤城外，余皆解放区，解放军岂能决堤自淹？其含血喷人之阴谋，不攻自破。现豫北武陟等地民主政府正率领全县人民，奋勇抢堵缺口，并发放救济粮款。非灾区人民也热情慰问与安置灾区难民。按：沁河大樊堤早于抗战初期，蒋贼以“阻挡日寇”为名，由其九十七军所破决，几年来迄未修复，直至解放军前次收复木栾店后，于七月二十五日开工修堵，至本月十四日，已将长达一百六十丈之缺口修坝一百三十余丈。
