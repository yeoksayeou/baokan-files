Xinhua News Agency, Western Henan Front, 24th -- After our army liberated the vast areas of western Henan, the people there quickly established democratic governments at all levels. The established governments include the democratic county governments of Xin'an, Mengjin, Luoyang, Mianchi, Luoning, Shanxian, Lingbao, Lushi, Songxian, Luonan, Yinan, and Yiyang, as well as three commissioner offices. The democratic governments at all levels are implementing land reform, opening granaries for disaster relief, abolishing the Baojia system, and eliminating exploitative taxes and levies. The people of western Henan, who have long suffered under Chiang Kai-shek's harsh rule, have finally seen the light of day again and unanimously and enthusiastically support the People's Government.
