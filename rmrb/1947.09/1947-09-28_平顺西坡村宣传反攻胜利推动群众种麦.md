    Pingshun, Xipo Village
    Propaganda on Counter-Offensive Victory Promotes Wheat Planting Among the Masses
    [Report from our Pingshun Office] Xipo Village, in the Fourth District, held a mass meeting on the night of the 16th of this month to publicize the news of the great victory of Liu and Deng's crossing south and promoted the planting work. The meeting pointed out that Liu and Deng's army crossing the Yellow River to the south and liberating vast areas was for the sake of the liberation of the people in the Kuomintang-controlled areas. Our people should dedicate themselves to Liu and Deng's army in the current work, step up planting, and increase production to support the front. The liberated peasant Wang Lintang said: "General Liu Bocheng is leading the army to fight old Chiang at the front for us, and the Communist Party is leading us in production and has also liberated us. This time I want to plant more wheat and work hard to produce more grain to support the front." Zhang Fuchen said, "I have twelve mu of wheat land and plan to plant nine mu of 169 wheat." The masses were in high spirits. In two days of hard work, thirty-seven laborers repaired 103 mu of land, and twenty-seven teams of livestock planted 134.5 mu. Zhang Pihu's team, in order to rush ahead and be the first to plant, carried manure to the fields at night, carrying forty loads in one night, and now plans to continue carrying. Old man Hu Gouze said, "Working under the leadership of the Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army, everyone knows who is working well." Old man Zhang Tunjin, in order to rush the planting, brought dry rations at noon and did not come back, saying, "Seeing this time, is it okay not to hurry up and plant?" Now the masses are enthusiastically carrying out harvesting and planting. (Bu Ji, Shi Xiu)
