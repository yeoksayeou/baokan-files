    Xinhua News Agency, Western Henan Front, September 27th—Our correspondent Mu Xin reports on the progress of the Western Henan Campaign: After our Liu-Deng army crossed south and advanced into Hubei and Anhui, the Chiang bandits ordered their subordinates to rush to repair the river defense fortifications day and night, and ordered each fort to manage a central stronghold, with direct telephone lines from each township and town to the county, and to use "dog soldiers" (police dogs) to guard the riverbank. Helplessly, their forces were weak and their soldiers lacked morale. At dawn on August 23rd, our Chen-Xie counter-offensive army initially showed its strength. Under the intense bombardment of artillery fire, the Chiang army's 300-mile river defense line immediately collapsed, and the defending enemies who did not have time to escape were all captured alive. Two battalions of a certain unit captured more than 1,200 men and guns in a short period of time, once again shattering the Chiang bandits' myth that the Yellow River is an impregnable natural barrier. Our other unit pursued the victory and advanced directly to Xin'an city. Before dawn on the 25th, after three hours of battle, the city was liberated, and the defending enemies, numbering over a thousand, were all captured, with only eight of our soldiers killed or wounded. Our army then advanced south of the railway, sweeping the vast area on both sides of the Longhai Railway. On the 30th, three cities were captured in six hours: Mianchi was captured at 14:00, Yiyang was liberated at 15:00, and Luoning was occupied at 19:00. Except for a few stubborn enemies in Mianchi who escaped, the rest were all annihilated. Our army then expanded its offensive, with one unit pincering the left flank of the Chiang army along both sides of the Funiu Mountains, liberating Songxian and Yiyang county towns on September 5th and 12th. Our army's right flank rushed to Lushi, occupying this throat of Henan and Shaanxi, which controls the Tai Ridge and the Funiu Ridge, on the night of the 10th, and inflicting heavy damage on the Wu Tinglin's troops in the northeast of Xin'an. On the 9th, our army intercepted the entire 64th Brigade and the 51st Regiment of the 17th Brigade, led by Wu Tinglin, commander of the enemy's 15th Division, and engaged in a fierce battle all day at Qizhuang and Zhongyue Village northeast of Xin'an, repelling 14 enemy counterattacks and annihilating the 191st Regiment of the enemy's 64th Brigade and severely damaging its 190th Regiment. Our army along the Longhai line then turned west, successively annihilating the Chiang army's New 1st Brigade and the entire 135th Brigade, the 2nd Brigade of the Youth 206th Division, and one regiment each of the 165th Brigade from the 10th to the 17th, liberating Lingbao, a famous cotton and jujube producing area, and Shanxian, an important town of the Chiang army in western Henan, and Wenxiang County, 60 li east of Tongguan. One unit of our army pursued the remnants and approached the suburbs of Tongguan. By this point, we had controlled 520 li of the Longhai Railway, and had penetrated more than 300 li into the enemy's depths. The enemy's defense line was fragmented, and their camp was in a state of panic, while our army's offensive was just beginning and continuing to expand its gains.
