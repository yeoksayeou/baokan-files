　　Deputy Commander Teng Reports on the Current Victorious Situation
　　Our Army Penetrates Deep into KMT-Controlled Areas
　　Calls on Cadres to Intensify Ideological Examination to Welcome the New Situation
　　[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper] The Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Military Region's Directly Subordinate Units convened a mobilization meeting for 500-plus cadres on August 26th to study land reform. Deputy Commander Teng personally attended and gave a speech, explaining the current victorious situation in the war and calling on everyone to study hard and transform their thinking. Deputy Commander Teng said: The current situation of the Chinese revolution is extremely favorable to the people and extremely unfavorable to the people's enemy, the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary group. Recently, the Liu-Deng army's victorious deep penetration into the KMT-controlled areas, with one main force liberating vast towns and cities in the Huai River region; another main force inserted west of Xinyang, destroying the Ping-Han Railway from Suiping south to north of Xinyang, threatening the three towns of Wuhan, shaking Nanjing and Shanghai, allowing tens of millions of elder brothers and younger sisters in the Central Plains to regain liberation. They were joyfully delighted, welcoming us on both sides of the road, and fervently demanding the immediate and thorough implementation of "land to the tiller." After crossing the river, another main force won immediate victories, controlling the section of the Longhai Railway east of Tongguan and west of Luoyang, liberating the vast masses of western Henan, frightening the Chiang-Hu reactionary elements in Xi'an, Luoyang, and Zhengzhou, causing chaos and terror, and leaving them utterly demoralized. Although the bandit Chiang Kai-shek painstakingly flew to Yan'an to direct the operations, he was unable to save the complete annihilation of his 36th Division in northern Shaanxi. American imperialist envoy Wedemeyer came to China to inspect for a month and had to return home disappointed with his tail between his legs. In short, our army has gradually gained greater initiative, and the situation of a major counter-offensive is increasingly unfolding. We must devote all our energy to supporting the front and strive for the victory of the major counter-offensive. We must also recognize the twists, turns and difficulties in the counter-offensive. We should not underestimate the enemy or be arrogant, and we should not slacken our work and study. Therefore, it is determined to study land reform policies within two months, and insist on at least two hours of study every day. It is required to combine war, work, and study to truly improve oneself. Because the millions upon millions of people in the newly liberated areas require a large number of cadres with war and work experience to help with their work, we therefore require our comrades to humbly study in this land reform, straighten their positions, prepare to undertake more work, and welcome the arrival of the new situation.
　　Next, Deputy Commander Teng pointed out: The nature of land reform is a thorough anti-feudal land revolution led by the proletariat, based on the poor peasants, and involving the broad masses of the people. Since the Central Committee's "May 4th" directive last year, all liberated areas that have thoroughly implemented land reform, implementing "leaving the middle untouched while moving both ends," uniting the middle peasants, and gaining the approval of over 90 percent of the rural population, have achieved great success. Our troop comrades, being busy participating in the patriotic war of self-defense, did not have time to participate in land reform work. Now, regardless of any department or comrade, they must all participate in the study without exception, seeking a deep and correct understanding of the essence of the Party's land reform policy, eliminate the remnants of landlord ideology, correct their positions, honestly work as long-term laborers for the people, and wholeheartedly and entirely serve the people. In the past, some comrades in the troops only cared about fighting and did not pay much attention to land reform, and not participating was wrong. Some even openly interfered with land reform, which is an unforgivable mistake. In the future, if anyone does not care about or participate in land reform, it is shirking their duty to the revolution. If anyone opposes land reform, in addition to engaging in a relentless ideological struggle with them, if they are unwilling to correct their errors and persist in their wrong opinions, if they are Party members, they will be expelled from the Party and the military without hesitation. In the future, the quality of cadres will be tested in front of the masses and approved by the masses. Some cadres do not work hard, make trouble, complain, talk about enjoyment, act like veterans, and become detached from the masses. These incorrect thoughts and behaviors must be thoroughly examined and reflected upon in this study, and must be corrected. Deputy Commander Teng said: In the past, the reason why cadres dared to make trouble like this was because the Party and the leadership gave them the right, which was wrong. This right is now formally announced to be taken back. Everything is for defeating Chiang Kai-shek, everything is for realizing "land to the tiller." Every comrade must improve their class consciousness and abide by Party discipline.
　　Then, Minister Zhang, representing the Military Region Study Committee, announced the regulations for land reform study. This study must fully achieve Party committee leadership, full participation, leader responsibility, and hands-on involvement. It was pointed out that this study is an ideological revolution, and it is necessary to carry out widespread and in-depth mobilization, induce and enlighten, so that every comrade consciously reflects and examines themselves, combines reading documents with reality, and adopts different methods according to different situations and requirements, such as inviting local cadres and emancipated peasants to report on the crimes of landlords exploiting and oppressing peasants and the actual situation of land reform, personally participating in the land reform work in the stationed villages, and carrying out grievance-airing movements in the troops. All methods that can open up thinking and improve class consciousness should be used as much as possible.

　　滕副司令员报告目前胜利形势
  　我军深入蒋区作战
    号召干部加紧查思想迎接新形势
    【本报特讯】晋冀鲁豫军区直属队，于八月二十六日召开五百余干部学习土地改革的动员大会，滕副司令员亲莅讲话，说明目前战争的胜利形势，号召大家努力学习，改造思想。滕副司令员说：现在中国革命形势对人民大众非常有利，对人民的敌人蒋介石反动集团非常不利。最近的刘邓大军胜利的深入蒋管区作战，一部主力解放淮河地区广大的城镇；一部主力插入信阳以西，破坏遂平以南至信阳以北一段平汉铁路，威胁武汉三镇，震动京沪，使中原数千万父老兄弟姊妹重获解放，他们欣欣然有喜色，夹道欢迎，热烈的要求即刻彻底实行耕者有其田。另一部主力渡河后，旗开得胜，控制了潼关以东，洛阳以西一段陇海路，解放豫西广大群众，吓得西安、洛阳、郑州蒋胡反动家伙，兵慌马乱，丧魂落魄。蒋贼介石虽煞费心机飞延安指挥，亦无法挽救其三十六师全军覆灭于陕北。美国帝国主义特使魏德迈亲来中国视察一月，亦不得不夹着尾巴扫兴而归。总之，我军逐渐取得了更大的主动性，大反攻形势日益展开起来，我们要以全付精力支援前线，争取大反攻的胜利。我们还要认识反攻中的曲折和困难，我们不应该轻敌自骄，我们不应该放松工作和学习。因此，确定在两月内学习土地改革政策，每日至少坚持两小时的学习。要求把战争、工作、学习结合起来干，才能真正的提高自己。因为新解放区千千万万的人民大众，要求大批的有战争、工作经验的干部去帮助工作，因此，要求我们同志在这次土地改革中虚心学习，摆正自己的立场，准备担负更多的工作，迎接新形势的到来。
    接着，滕副司令员指出：土地改革其性质是无产阶级领导的、以贫农为基础的人民大众的、彻底反封建的土地革命。自从中央去年“五四”指示一年以来，全解放区凡彻底执行土地改革，实行中间不动两头动，团结中农，取得农村百分之九十多数的赞同者，均获得很大的成绩。我们部队同志因忙于参加爱国的自卫战争，来不及参加土地改革工作，现在不论任何部门任何同志都要毫不例外的参加学习，求得深刻的正确的认识党的土地改革政策的本质，肃清地主思想残余，端正立场，老老实实为人民当长工，诚心诚意全心全意为人民服务；过去部队某些同志只管打仗，对土地改革不大关心，不参加是不对的。有的甚至公开干涉土地改革，更是不可饶恕的错误。今后若再有不关心不参加土地改革者，就是对革命怠工，谁再反对土地改革，除与之在思想上作无情的斗争外，若不愿改正而坚持其错误意见，他是党员，就开除他的党籍和军籍，亦在所不惜。今后干部好坏，要在群众面前去考验，叫群众批准。某些干部不好好工作，闹情绪，发牢骚，讲享受，摆老资格，脱离群众，这些不正确思想和行为均要在这次学习中好好检查彻底反省，务必有所改正。滕副司令员说：过去干部所以敢这样闹腾，是党是领导上给他的权利、是不对的。这种权利现在正式宣布要收回来了，一切为了打垮蒋介石，一切为了实现耕者有其田，每个同志都须要提高自己的阶级觉悟，要遵守党的纪律。
    接着张部长代表军直学委会宣布关于土地改革学习的规定。这次学习要完全做到党委领导，全体参加，首长负责，亲自动手。指出这次学习是思想上的革命，必须普遍深入动员，诱导启发，使每个同志自觉反省检讨，阅读文件与实际结合，根据不同情况和要求采取不同的方法，如邀请地方干部及翻身农民报告地主剥削压迫农民的罪恶及土地改革的实际情况，亲自参加驻村的土地改革工作，开展部队的诉苦运动等，凡是能够打通思想提高阶级觉悟的方法尽量采用。
