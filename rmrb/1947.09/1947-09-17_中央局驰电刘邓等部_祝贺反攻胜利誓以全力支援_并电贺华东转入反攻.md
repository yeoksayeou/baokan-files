Xinhua News Agency, Jinji Luyu, 15th: The counter-offensive army of Liu, Deng, Xu, and Li's units victoriously reached the Dabie Mountains, recovered more than 20 county towns, and achieved brilliant results. The Central Bureau of the Jinji Luyu Committee of the Chinese Communist Party sent a telegram of congratulations. The original telegram is as follows: Commander Liu, Political Commissar Deng, Deputy Commander Xu, Division Commander Li, and all commanders, fighters, and accompanying working comrades: After annihilating a large number of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops in southwestern Shandong, you swept across the Longhai Railway and advanced into the Central Plains, opening the prelude to the great liberation war in the provinces north of the Yangtze River. From then on, the people of Hubei, Henan, and Anhui in the Central Plains were freed from the heinous rule of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang, and the victorious foundation for completely eliminating all of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops and realizing national democratic liberation was laid. The people of our entire region are inspired by the good news. We congratulate you on this great victory. We are deeply engaged in the land reform movement, we are helping the families of the soldiers fighting on the front lines to arrange this year's autumn harvest, and we are strengthening the support-the-front movement; we are preparing all our strength to overthrow Chiang Kai-shek. We hereby report to you by telegram and extend our cordial greetings.

The original telegram is as follows: Generals Chen Geng, Fuzhi, Han Jun, Cong Zhou, Jiwei, and all the commanders, fighters, and working comrades fighting on the front lines: In order to liberate the people of Henan and Shaanxi south of the Yellow River, you have victoriously crossed the river and reached your most glorious position. Due to your powerful offensive, coordinated with the great counter-offensive of the Northwest People's Liberation Army, all the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops in Qin, Long, Zheng, and Luo have been frightened out of their wits. The future of their complete annihilation has been determined. From then on, the people of western Henan and southern Shaanxi will see the light of day again, and the evil rule of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang will never return.

The mighty army crossed to the south, and in the Battle of Shatuji on the 7th, you annihilated the entire 57th Division in one fell swoop. Due to your victorious attack, and in coordination with the great liberation war that has already begun in the provinces north of the Yangtze River, the people of the whole country know that the best is yet to come. The people of our entire region will do everything in our power to support you, completely eliminate Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops who have fallen into the quagmire, and recover all lost territory.
