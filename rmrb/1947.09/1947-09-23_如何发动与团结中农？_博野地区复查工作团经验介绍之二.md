How to Mobilize and Unite with Middle Peasants?
——Experience Introduction (2) from the BoYe Region Re-examination Work Group
    In this re-examination, the initial focus was correctly placed on mobilizing and organizing poor peasant groups. However, the failure to simultaneously focus on mobilizing propaganda and education among middle peasants led to an initial detour in uniting with them.

    When exactly is the right time to absorb and mobilize middle peasants? In the twelve demonstration villages, there were essentially two approaches: The first was to open the door to middle peasants after the poor peasant groups were organized and consolidated. Initially, when they requested to join, the attitude was to "hold them back." This led to increasing and more insistent requests from the middle peasants. This was the approach in the six eastern demonstration villages. The second approach was not to divide the organization of poor peasants and the uniting of middle peasants into stages. The mobilization of middle peasants began simultaneously with the organization of poor peasants. Some of the six western villages adopted this approach. The former method, in practice, did not focus on enlightening and educating the middle peasants during the organization of poor peasants, effectively closing the door to them. As a result, some middle peasants became suspicious. In Yangcun and Xiaowang, some individual middle peasants even started extravagant eating and drinking. In Nanyi, some individual middle peasants packed their belongings, giving landlords an opportunity to exploit (e.g., the Yangcun landlord Fu Luorui spread rumors and threatened two middle peasant households, saying, "This time, you'll all be begging for food." The two households burst into tears.). The latter method, if not carefully managed by the leadership, could lead to a rush of middle peasants joining, with some villages mixing middle and poor peasants. This could affect the consolidation of poor peasant groups, weaken the leadership and education of poor peasants, and even lead to middle peasants usurping the leadership role of poor and hired peasants.

    When exactly is the right time to organize middle peasants? According to the experience of the twelve villages, two principles should be adhered to:

    1. The poor and hired peasant groups should be organized first, and then the poor peasants should unite with the middle peasants, after the poor peasants understand the necessity of absorbing middle peasants for assistance. (The poor peasant groups should be reviewed and consolidated to a certain degree, establishing the idea of the poor peasants as the mainstay.)

    2. The middle peasants should be mobilized, connected, and educated by the poor peasants and active middle peasant elements, reaching a peak in their enthusiasm for participating in the struggle.

    At this juncture, a comprehensive absorption of middle peasants should begin immediately. Under the leadership of the poor peasants, the middle peasants should be quickly organized. It is not advisable to organize middle peasants too early or too late. Too early, and the poor peasant groups are not yet consolidated. Too late, and the middle peasants are easily discouraged.

    The specific methods for uniting and organizing middle peasants are basically of two forms: The first form is the method of having the poor peasant groups separately mobilize, unite, and help the middle peasants organize. For example, in Beiyi, the composition of each household was discussed in the poor peasant group meetings, determining who were landlords and rich peasants, and who were middle peasants. Finally, based on feelings, distance of residence, and other relationships, specific individuals were assigned to absorb them. In Nanyi and Yangcun, those who actively requested to join the organization during the organization of poor peasant groups were assigned to organize and unite more middle peasants. This method is more cautious, and most of those organized were approved by the poor peasant groups. The second form is the method of having the middle peasants organize themselves widely under the leadership and call of the poor peasant representatives' meeting. For example, in Nanzhu, a general call was made at the poor peasant grievance meeting. After the meeting, middle peasants went to register with the representatives' meeting, with 125 people signing up on the spot. In Xiaowang and Di Quan, the representatives' meeting convened a middle and poor peasant meeting, comprehensively absorbing middle peasants and forming them into groups.

    In mobilizing the masses, attention should be paid to igniting the enthusiasm of the middle peasants. In the early stages of organizing poor peasant groups, the adoption of a "suppressive" and "frustrating" attitude towards middle peasants, being cold, indifferent, and even individually discriminating or excluding them, without simultaneously conducting anti-feudal ideological enlightenment among them, was inappropriate. This caused many active elements among the middle peasants to hesitate outside the door, affecting the middle peasants' enthusiasm for participating in the struggle, and even causing them to doubt or separate from the poor and hired peasants. Villages where these biases existed took detours. Conversely, villages that seized upon the active elements among the middle peasants while organizing poor peasant groups, and then had these active elements unite with the middle peasants after enlightenment and education, not only shortened the time but also reduced the separation between the middle and poor peasants, and strengthened the unity among the peasants. However, in uniting with the middle peasants, it is also necessary to establish the idea of poor peasants as the leading backbone. Therefore, it should be explained to the poor peasants that "we are the backbone," and "poor peasants must control the power in the village," establishing the leadership and ownership of the poor peasants. But to the middle peasants, it should be proposed that "middle and poor peasants are one family," so as not to make them wary ideologically.

    Regarding the wealthy middle peasants, although they are close to the rich peasants, they are fundamentally different from them and should be seen as objects of unity, not objects of struggle. However, those with prominent problems should not be exempted from powerful political exposure. In some villages, wealthy middle peasants were not actively strived for membership, treating wealthy middle peasants the same as rich peasants, which was also inappropriate. Because the re-examination struggle should not only maximize the isolation of the enemy but also maximize the unity of our own ranks. In addition, uniting with the middle peasants requires constantly and carefully listening to their opinions. The middle peasants are most sensitive to every move in the mass struggle. If the move is correct, they will support it. Otherwise, they will oppose it and even show signs of wavering easily. The agreement or disagreement of the middle peasants plays a decisive role in maintaining the unity of more than 90 percent of the peasants. Therefore, slight negligence, such as not listening to the opinions of the middle peasants, will lead to mistakes. For example, in Yangcun, the struggle against the rich peasant local bully Shi Luoba, most poor peasants reflected that he should be struggled against, but should not be swept out of his house, which would be too harsh. However, the middle peasants expressed disagreement. However, only a few spoke at the struggle meeting, and the middle peasants did not speak. In the end, a few exploited the unpreparedness of the masses' thinking and decided to sweep him out of his house. As a result, the middle peasants were dissatisfied, following the path of a few and forming an excessive handling error.

    Listening to the opinions of the middle peasants, but also cannot be the tail of the middle peasants. The correct opinions of the poor peasants, if the middle peasants agree, should be done immediately. If the middle peasants do not agree, then consider it again, and handle it after reaching a consensus. This way, you will not be detached from the middle peasant masses.

    如何发动与团结中农？
    ——博野地区复查工作团经验介绍之二
    这次复查，一开始首先着重发动组织了贫农小组，这是完全对的；但对中农没同时抓紧进行发动的宣传教育，因而在团结中农问题上一开始就走了弯路。
    究竟什么时机吸收和发动中农呢？十二个示范村，实际上有两个作法：第一种是在贫农小组组织起来，并得到巩固，再向中农开门。开始他们要求加入，采取“压压”。这样，中农要求越紧也越多，东部六个示范村都是这个办法。第二种是组织贫农和联合中农不划分阶段，在组织贫农的同时，就开始发动中农。西六村有的是这样做的。前一种方法在组织贫农时实际没有抓紧对中农的启发教育，对中农关起门来，结果有些中农怀疑。甚至在杨村、小王个别中农大吃大喝起来。南邑个别中农则收拾东西，给地主留下了可乘之机。（如杨村地主傅洛瑞即造谣威胁两户中农说：“这次就全让你们要饭了。”两户大哭起来。）后一种办法，如果领导上不注意，中农一拥而入，有的村中农贫农混合起来，影响了贫农小组的巩固，容易放松对贫农的领导教育，甚至产生中农代替贫雇农的领导权。
    到底什么时候组织中农合适呢？根据十二个村的经验，应该坚持两条原则：
    一、贫雇农小组先组织，并由贫农去团结中农，在贫农了解到必须吸收中农来帮助时。（贫农小组审查和巩固到一定程度，树立了贫农为主的思想。）
    二、中农经贫农和中农积极分子的鼓动、串通和教育，在纷纷要求参加斗争的情绪发展到最高潮时。
    到这种时机，就应立即开始全面吸收中农，在贫农领导下，使中农很快组织起来，组织中农不宜过早，也不宜过迟。过早了贫农小组还不巩固，过晚了则易使中农冷淡下去。
    联合和组织中农的具体方法，基本上有两种形式：第一种形式是由贫农小组去分别发动，联合和帮助中农组织的办法。如北邑是在贫农小组会上进行挨门挨户的讨论成份，谁是地主富农，谁是中农，最后决定根据感情、住地远近及其他关系再分别确定由专人去吸收。南邑、杨村则是把组织贫农小组时积极要求加入组织者，由他去组织团结更多的中农。这种办法比较谨慎，组织起来者，多数全经贫农小组同意和批准。第二种形式是在贫农代表会的领导号召下，广泛的由中农自己组织起来的办法。如南祝是在贫农诉苦大会上，作普遍的号召，会后中农即去代表会登记，当场报名者即达一二五人。小王、堤圈则由代表会召开中贫农大会，全面吸收中农，编成小组。
    在发动群众中，要注意启发中农的热气。在组织贫农小组的初期，对中农采取了“压”和“蹩”冷淡、不管，甚至个别歧视或排斥，没有对中农同时进行反封建的思想启发，是不妥当的。因此使广大的中农中的积极分子，徘徊门外，影响了中农要求参加斗争的热气，甚至怀疑或与贫雇农离开。存在这些偏向的村庄，都走了些弯路。相反的在组织贫农小组的同时，抓住了中农中的积极分子，经过启发教育，再由积极分子去联合中农的村庄，不但缩短了时间，同时也减少了中贫农间之隔阂，增强了农民间的团结。但团结中农，又要树立以贫农为领导骨干的思想。因此对贫农说明“咱们是骨干”，“贫苦农民要掌握村中大权”，树立贫农的领导权和主人翁的思想，但对中农则提出“中农贫农是一家”，从思想上不要使它有所戒备。
    对富裕中农问题，虽然他们接近富农，但和富农有原则区别，应看成是联合对象，不应视为斗争的对象，但对有突出问题者、却也不应放弃政治上的有力揭发。有的村对富裕中农没有积极争取吸收入会，把富裕中农和富农一律看待，也是不妥当的。因为复查斗争，不但要最大限度的孤立敌人，还要最大限度的团结自己。此外，团结中农，还须经常细心倾听中农的意见，在群众斗争中的一举一动，中农的感觉最敏锐、举动正确则拥护，否则即反对，甚至表现了时刻容易动摇，中农的同意与否，在保持百分之九十以上农民的一致是起决定作用的，因此稍一疏忽，不倾听中农的意见，即将造成错误。如杨村斗争富农土棍士洛巴，多数贫农反映应该斗，但是不应扫地出门，弄得过重；而中农则表示不同意斗。可是在斗争会上只是几个少数分子发言，中农则不发言，最后被少数分子利用了群众思想上的无准备，决定扫地出门，结果中农不满，走了少数分子的路线，形成过火处理的错误。
    听取中农的意见，但也不能做中农的尾巴，贫农的正确意见，中农同意就马上办，中农不同意就再考虑，商量一致再办，这样才不致脱离中农群众。
