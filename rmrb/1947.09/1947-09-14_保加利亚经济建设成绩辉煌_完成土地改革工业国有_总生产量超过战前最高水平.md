　　Bulgaria Achieves Brilliant Economic Construction Results
  　Land Reform Completed, Industry Nationalized
  　Total Production Exceeds Pre-War Peak
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 11th] Sofia Dispatch: Grand rallies were held throughout Bulgaria on the 9th to commemorate the third anniversary of the country's liberation. Over the past three years, the revival of Bulgaria's national economy has achieved significant success. Under the leadership of the Fatherland Front, Bulgaria has completed land reform and the nationalization of industry, enabling 300,000 landless or land-poor peasants to obtain land, and placing industries, of which 48.7 percent were monopolized by foreign capital, under the management of the government and workers. The currency reform implemented in March of this year has eliminated inflation and stabilized Bulgaria's economy. The two-year plan, which began this year, is being implemented smoothly. According to the plan, this year's total production will increase by 36 percent compared to 1939, and next year it will increase by 67 percent. In the past eight months, many work departments have exceeded their plans, making the current total industrial production greatly exceed the pre-war peak level of 1939. Hundreds of factories, power stations, railways, and highways are under vigorous construction. Artificial lakes being built for the establishment of power stations, such as "Kolarov," "Rojaza," "Koplinka," and "Topolnitsa," have been started simultaneously on an unprecedented scale. In the past seven months, electricity production has exceeded the original plan by 3 percent, and more than 100 villages have received electricity supply according to plan, promoting the electrification and mechanization of rural areas. Agricultural production has exceeded the pre-war level by 13 percent. As a result of social reform and production development, the living standards of the working people have greatly improved. The real wages of workers and staff have increased by 70 percent this year compared to pre-war levels. Cultural life has also been greatly improved, with the number of primary schools across the country more than doubling and the number of middle schools doubling.
