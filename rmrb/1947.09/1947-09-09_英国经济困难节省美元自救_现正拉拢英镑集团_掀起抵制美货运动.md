Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 6th. Comprehensive reports: Several signs indicate that Britain is attempting to launch a movement within its empire to boycott American goods in order to conserve its dollar reserves. On August 21st, the British government appealed to all members of the British Empire to "increase production and reduce withdrawals from Britain to help stabilize the shock caused by the freezing of dollar supplies" (Associated Press). On August 31st, British Food Minister Strachey disclosed that in order to save dollars, Britain has now stopped buying food from the United States. At Britain's request, the Australian government again announced on September 2nd that it would reduce imports of luxury vehicles and tobacco from the United States by 20 percent, newspapers by 30 percent, and prohibit the import of American cotton fabrics. It also announced that it would not use dollars to buy airplanes and would strictly control all dollar remittances. Since a crisis similar to Britain's is also hitting Canada, financial figures and most newspapers in that country have called for measures to resist the massive influx of American goods (Note: In the first six months of this year, the trade surplus with the US exceeded $480 million). Taking advantage of this situation, the British government announced on September 2nd that it had suggested to the governments of the various member states of the Empire that talks on the recent financial situation be held in London as soon as possible. According to the British weekly *Observer* on August 31st, this meeting will formulate trade relations between Britain and the various dominions and may abandon the "non-discrimination" policy insisted upon by the United States, that is, the various dominions may impose lower import taxes on British goods than on American goods. British officials revealed on September 1st that the attendees at this meeting will not only be limited to countries within the Empire, but will also include countries using the pound sterling such as Iraq and Iceland. At that time, the British government will call on the countries of the sterling area to limit imports of American goods, just like Britain. On September 3rd, Foreign Secretary Bevin publicly suggested at the Southport Trades Union Congress that a customs union be established between the British Empire and its member states to solve part of Britain's difficulties. Bevin said: "We fear that we will need long-term joint defense, and if we want to avoid the endless cycle of economic crises, we must accept certain common economic principles."

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 6th. London dispatch: In order to save its increasingly scarce dollars, the British government will force the British people to return to the difficult life of wartime starting this month. According to the British government's announcement on the night of August 27th, the meat ration for the British people will be reduced by one-seventh, the basic gasoline ration will be cancelled, the food supply in restaurants and hotels will be reduced by 18 percent from September 14th, overseas travel will be prohibited, and the number of people attending public banquets will also be limited. According to officials, this measure will save Britain £328 million a year.

　　英国经济困难节省美元自救
  　现正拉拢英镑集团
    掀起抵制美货运动
    【新华社陕北六日电】综合报导：若干迹象显示英国正图在其帝国内部掀起一个抵制美货运动，以节约其美元外汇。八月二十一日，英政府曾向大英帝国各成员呼吁：“增加生产而少自英国提款，以帮助镇定因美元供应之冻结所产生之震动”（美联社）。八月三十一日，英粮食部长斯特拉澈披露，为节省美元，英国现已停止向美购买食物。在英国请求下，九月二日英自治区澳洲又宣布减少自美输入华丽车辆、烟草百分之二十，印报纸百分之三十，及禁止美国棉织品入口，并宣布不用美元买飞机，严格管制一切美元汇款。由于类似英国的危机正袭击着加拿大，因此该国财政界人士及大多数报纸纷纷要求采取措施，以抵制大量的美货入超（按：今年六个月内美贸易中加入超过达四亿八千万美元）。利用这种形势，英政府九月二日宣布：已向帝国各成员国政府建议，尽早在伦敦举行有关最近财政情况的商谈。据八月三十一日英星期观察家报称：这次会议将拟定英与各自治领的贸易关系，并可能抛弃美国所坚持的“不歧视”政策，即各自治领可能对英货进口征收较美货为低之进口税。英官方人士于九月一日透露，出席这次会议的，将不仅限于帝国内部各国，而且包括伊拉克、冰岛等使用英镑各国。居时，英政府将呼吁英镑集团各国与英国一样，限制美货进口。九月三日贝文外相在南港职工大会上更公开建议：由英帝国与各成员国间订立关税同盟，解决英国一部份困难，贝文称：“吾人恐须长期共同防御，如欲避免经济危机之循环不已，更须接受某些共同经济原则。”
    【新华社陕北六日电】伦敦讯：英政府为了节约日益缺少的美元，将强迫英国人民自本月份起再度恢复战时的艰苦生活。据八月二十七日夜英政府的公告，英人的肉类配给将削减七分之一，汽油之基本配给量被取消，餐旅馆的食物供给自九月十四日起减少百分之十八，国外旅行则被禁止，出席公共宴会的人数亦有限制。据官方称，此项措施将使英国一年节省三亿两千八百万镑。
