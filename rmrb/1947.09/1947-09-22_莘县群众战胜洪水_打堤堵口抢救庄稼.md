    Xin County Masses Conquer Flood
    Build Dikes, Plug Breaches, and Save Crops
    [This newspaper's Jinnan dispatch on the 20th] Continuous autumn rains in Xin County caused the old and new Jinqian Rivers to suddenly breach their banks on the evening of August 15th. The floodwaters surged, reaching depths of two to three or even four to five feet on the plains. A large part of the autumn crops in the Seventh District were submerged. The leadership immediately suspended all other work and rushed to repair and build dikes. Under the slogans of "mutual assistance and self-rescue" and "build one more li of dike, save ten more seedlings," more than ten thousand people launched a struggle against the flood. After two days and nights of intense effort, most of the dangerous sections were completed, and more than ten li of dikes were built. During the rescue, more than a thousand people from the Second District, which was farther from the water, brought their own food and furniture to the First District to assist in the rescue. More than ten villages in the Fifth District were flooded, and most of the crops were killed by the water. More than a thousand militiamen and three thousand self-defense forces in the district built two dikes sixty steps apart in the middle of the convex line. The dike work was completed in one day, and the floodwater flowed into the river. In the Zhan Tun area of the Fourth and Sixth Districts, more than six hundred mu of the 2,700 mu of land were submerged. Men, women, and children were mobilized to build dikes to block the water. They built a three-li-long dike, three feet high and wide, for three consecutive days and nights, blocking the advance of the water. In Zhang Zhuang, Tian Ji, and other areas of the Third District, more than a thousand mu of fertile land were rescued.
