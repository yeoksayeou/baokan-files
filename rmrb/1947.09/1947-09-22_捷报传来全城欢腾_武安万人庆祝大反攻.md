Good News Spreads, City Rejoices: Wuan Celebrates the Great Counter-Offensive

[Our newspaper's dispatch from Wuan] On the 14th, after the victorious news of the start of the great counter-offensive reached Wuan City, everyone spread the word, overjoyed. Whoever held the good news was immediately surrounded by a crowd of people, asking the reader to read louder. The reader, in turn, read with greater enthusiasm. Some hadn't even heard it all before running off to spread the word. At the same time, loudspeakers in each street shouted, "We've hit Chiang Kai-shek's lair! The old feudal roots are about to fall!" At 3:00 PM the next day, the county's directly subordinate organizations, schools, troops stationed in the area, and over ten thousand people from the urban area held a celebration in the light rain. People held small flags or carried large boards with slogans such as "Celebrate the start of the great counter-offensive, attack the Chiang-controlled areas," "Dig out Chiang Kai-shek, the root of all evil, so that the people of the whole country can be liberated," and "Work hard to produce more wheat to support the front lines and guarantee victory." The rally began with three cannon shots. County Magistrate Zhang spoke, pointing out that the great counter-offensive had begun, and in order to expand the victory, the rear must support the front. Therefore, he called on the entire county to: (1) Expand wheat fields by 200,000 mu. (2) Implement thrift, rectify finances; if all villages can achieve self-sufficiency, 70,000,000 yuan can be saved annually. (3) The front fights Chiang Kai-shek, the rear struggles against the petty Chiangs; if feudalism is not completely eliminated, the struggle must continue. Afterwards, Deputy Commissioner Jia of the Fifth Administrative Office spoke. Finally, Comrade Wang Tingdong, Secretary of the County Party Committee, took the stage, saying that today's victorious counter-offensive is a victory for land reform. For the sake of land, 15,000 Wuan warriors are carrying guns at the front, and over one hundred Wuan cadres have crossed the Yellow River, which is the glory of the 300,000 people of Wuan. He demanded that all cadres, organizations, schools, and veterans examine their thinking, examine their class standing, improve themselves, and unite more closely with the masses to implement land reform. Cadres must always prepare themselves so that when the masses south of the Yellow River ask them to help them liberate themselves, they will resolutely go without hesitation.

After the meeting, people discussed excitedly. A village cadre from one street said, "Hearing this news, the more I hear, the happier I get." Wang Yongnian, a liberated poor peasant, spoke from his own experience of liberation: "I used to sell tofu basket by basket, only wanting to be liberated. Which of the masses in Chiang's rear doesn't want to be liberated? When the army arrives, the masses there will be happy!" Han Sanmao, a refugee who fled from Henan, said, "The landlords and despots there have guns, but the masses are also brave. As soon as the army arrives, the masses will immediately arm themselves and carry out the struggle." Now, cadres in organizations and schools, and the masses in the urban area, are working with redoubled enthusiasm. (Lu Lin, Yongqi)

[Another dispatch] On August 30th, at dawn, 129 militiamen from the Seventh District set off to participate in the war in Tangyin. Passing through Yangyi Town, cadres and the masses, hearing the news, immediately sounded the bugle to gather the masses and organize a farewell. In less than the time it takes to eat a meal, over two hundred women and children from the east and west streets gathered, and more than one hundred primary school students from the Seventh Elementary School also participated. Suddenly, gongs and drums filled the air, and slogans like "Defend the fruits of the struggle! Defend the autumn harvest and autumn planting!" "Good men support the front, go to the front and perform meritorious service to become heroes!"... resounded as one. Merchants on the street also raised over 20,000 yuan for food in a short period of time, buying fifty jin of eggplant, forty jin of vermicelli, and thirteen jin of pork for the militiamen to eat. They cheered all the way to the main road east of the village, and the militiamen happily said, "This time, we must do a good job." (Xichen)

    捷报传来全城欢腾
    武安万人庆祝大反攻
    【本报武安讯】十四日，大反攻开始的胜利消息传到武安城后，人人奔走相告，欣喜若狂，谁拿着捷报谁跟前就围聚着一群人，听者要求读的人声大些，读者是越读越有劲，有的还没听完全，就又跑去传告了。同时各街的喇叭筒，也都大喊起来：“打到蒋介石老窝了，封建老根快倒了”。第二天下午三点钟，全县县直属机关、学校、驻军及城关万余群众，在蒙蒙细雨中举行庆祝，人们手执小旗，或扛着大板，上写“庆祝大反攻开始，打到蒋管区去”“刨掉老蒋这个大祸根，全国人民都翻身”，“努力生产多种麦，支援前线，保证胜利”等标语。大会在三声炮响之后开始，张县长讲话，他指出大反攻开始了，为了扩大胜利，必须后方支援前线，因此他号召全县：（一）要扩大麦田二十万亩。（二）贯澈节约，整顿财政，如能作到全部村庄自给，一年即可省七万万元。（三）前方打老蒋，后方斗小蒋，封建消灭不彻底，继续斗争。接着五专署贾副专员讲话，最后县委书记王庭栋同志登台，他说今天反攻胜仗，是打的土地胜仗，为着土地，武安一万五千战士扛着枪在前方，武安一百余干部过了黄河，这都是武安三十万人民的光荣。他要求全体干部、机关、学校、荣军都要查思想、查阶级、提高自己，和群众更加团结一致，贯澈土地改革，干部要随时准备自己，当黄河南群众那天要求自己去帮助他们翻身时，即毫不犹豫的坚决前去。
    会后人群中兴奋议论，一街一个村干部说：“听到这消息，越听越高兴呵。”翻身贫民王永年更从自己翻身经验说：“我从前一筐一担卖豆腐、光想翻身，蒋后方群众谁不想翻身？大军到那里，那里群众才高兴呢！”河南逃来难民韩三毛说：“那里地主恶霸们有枪，可是群众也都胆壮，只要大军一到，群众马上就会武装起来进行斗争的。”现在机关学校干部，城关群众，都热情百倍的紧张工作。（鲁林、永琪）
    【又讯】八月三十日五更天，七区民兵一二九人出发到汤阴参战，路经阳邑镇，干部群众闻讯，立即鸣号集合群众整队欢送，不到一顿饭功夫，东西街就集合了妇女儿童群众二百多人，七高小一百多小学生也参加，霎时锣鼓喧天，“保卫斗争果实。保卫秋收秋耕！”“好男儿支援前线，到前线立功当英雄！”………的口号声响成一片，商街并在短时间内募集了菜金二万多元，买了五十斤茄子，四十斤粉条，十三斤猪肉，给民兵们吃。他们一直欢送到村东的大马路上，民兵们也高兴的说：“这次出去可得好好干”。（洗尘）
