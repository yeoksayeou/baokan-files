    [Jilu Yu Daily, 19th dispatch] In the Fourth District of Puyang, peasant farmers, having been emancipated, are combining production with cultural emancipation, carrying out adult education, and the masses are very enthusiastic about learning to read. In Ningjia Village, all the original twenty-two mutual aid teams are also study groups, with literate people serving as study group leaders, or the original team leader concurrently serving. A literacy board is set up at the meal location. There are seven locations in the whole village, and village cadres and students are responsible for teaching words on one board each during meal times. When going to the fields for production, the team leader writes words on simple wooden boards. Some teams write them on each hoe handle, and during breaks, they smoke while using their fingers to practice writing on the ground. Ning Erzhu said: "The thumb is the pen, the ground is the paper, and we poor children can also write!" Because the village has little land and many people, most of them grow vegetables. They organized eight vegetable garden teams and six vegetable selling teams. When working in the vegetable garden, they write the names of various vegetables on the pillars of the pergola to learn the vegetable names. When selling vegetables, they write the names of the vegetables on the vegetable cart, learning while selling. Political education takes place during breaks in the cool places in the morning and afternoon, in the form of informal chats or arguments, and in the evening, it is combined with mass meetings. Li Zhuken of the Seventh Team said: "Our government is really thoughtful! My ancestors for generations were illiterate, but I never expected that I would be able to write today! I want to study hard and never be a blind illiterate again." Li Zhuken has now learned more than forty characters. Zhu Yuecheng, a young woman, learns whatever she does. The village cadre writes the names of various vegetables on wooden boards, and a wooden board is inserted next to a certain vegetable field. If they forget, they go to the board and the vegetable to look. In this way, their enthusiasm for production and learning is very high. Yang Chunfu has his own crooked writing in places where he eats, rests, and defecates. In less than half a month, he has recognized more than one hundred characters.

    濮阳四区翻身农民
    生产中学文化
    【本报冀鲁豫十九日电】濮阳四区在生产中，结合文化翻身，进行成年教育，群众对学习识字情绪很高。宁家村全村原有二十二个互助组，每组亦为学习组，内有识字的如学习组长，或原组长兼任。饭场处，设一识字牌。全村共设七处，在开饭时，由村干及学生，每人负责一块教字。下地生产时，组长用简单的木板写上字，有的组写在每个锄把上，歇时一面吸烟，一面用手指头在地上学写。宁二猪说：“二拇指就是笔，地就是纸，我们穷孩子也会写字啦！”该村地少人多，大部份种菜，他们将种菜的另组织了八个菜园组，六个卖菜组，在菜园作活时，将各种菜名写在凉棚柱子上，学菜名。卖菜时，将菜名写在菜车上，一面卖菜，一面学习。政治教育，白天是上下晌在凉快地方休息时，不拘形式的闲谈或是争论，晚上是结合群众会谈。七组的李猪肯说：“咱的政府想的真到呀，我上几辈没有识字的，不料我今天会写字啦！我要吃劲学，再不当这个瞪眼瞎子。”现李猪肯已学了四十多个字。朱月城青年妇女是作啥学啥，村干将各种菜名写在木板上，某一种菜田旁插一个木板，他们忘了就到木板及菜那里看一看，这样，他们生产学习情绪很高，杨春福吃饭、休息屙屎的地方，都有他写的七歪八扭的字样，不到半月时间，他就认了一百多字。
