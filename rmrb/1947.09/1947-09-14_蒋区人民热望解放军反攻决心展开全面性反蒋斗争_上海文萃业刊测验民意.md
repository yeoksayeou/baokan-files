Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 12th: The Shanghai Wen Cui Congkan, a progressive publication suffering persecution under Chiang Kai-shek's bandits, recently published the results of a public opinion poll on the peace issue in its seventh issue. There were a total of 303 participants, including workers, farmers, students, vendors, merchants, public servants, teachers, housewives, police, and soldiers (including eight air force personnel) from across Nanjing, Shanghai, Beiping, Tianjin, Sichuan, Yunnan, and other places. The questions were: (1) What kind of peace do we need? 299 people, or 98.6% of the total, supported thoroughly destroying the reactionary ruling class and achieving a complete and lasting peace. (2) How can we achieve the peace you need? 291 people, or 96% of the total, advocated forcing the reactionaries to lay down their weapons. Specific suggestions included, on the one hand, striving for military victories by the main force for democracy – the people's army – implementing a large-scale counter-offensive, and thoroughly eliminating the warmongering reactionaries. On the other hand, it meant the people in the Kuomintang-controlled areas would unanimously rise up to develop a comprehensive anti-civil war and anti-hunger struggle, implementing worker strikes, student strikes, teacher strikes, merchant strikes, "Nationalist (Chiang) army" officers and soldiers refusing to fight, and implementing armed uprisings against conscription, grain requisition, and taxes. (3) How can we guarantee a truly permanent democratic peace? Where does the power to guarantee peace lie? How should those who undermine peace be dealt with? 294 people, or 97% of the total, believed that the power to guarantee peace lies in the hands of the Chinese people, the Chinese Communist Party, and other democratic parties. They advocated thoroughly destroying the reactionary anti-democratic forces and the one-party dictatorship, confiscating the property of the four major families, expelling the shameless American troops, abolishing the Kuomintang's "National Assembly" and the "Constitution" it passed, and publicly trying war criminals and secret service bosses and sentencing them to death.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 12th: Beiping, under the rule of the Chiang government, is described by a United Press reporter as a "city dying in the shadows." According to a United Press dispatch from Beiping on the 9th, Beiping has been placed under martial law, with military police ordered to open fire at will if they deem citizens to be engaged in "suspicious" activities. The airport is heavily guarded by military police, and civilian cars are stopped outside the barbed wire fence, except for cars belonging to (Chiang) government officials and Chiang's army. Airplane passengers are stopped by fully armed and arrogant soldiers for strict and tedious checks. Because of the lack of coal, there are frequent power outages, and the city looks cold and dark, as quiet as the countryside after 9 p.m. The terror of food shortages is spreading, and prices are constantly rising.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 10th: Ping Bao reports: The ratio of applicants to admissions in public middle school entrance examinations in Beiping fully reflects the seriousness of the problem of youth being out of school in today's "cultural city." Due to difficult living conditions and the sharp increase in tuition fees in private middle schools, ordinary middle-class families are making their children apply to public middle schools in order to barely maintain their studies. This autumn, a total of 8,254 students applied for senior high school in municipal middle schools, and 20,306 applied for junior high school. The number of students admitted to senior high school was 1,230, and the number of students admitted to junior high school was 1,310. The number of students admitted to senior and junior high school was only 8.8% of the number of applicants. Among the remaining 26,020 students who were not admitted, only a very small number from wealthy families can hope to transfer to private middle schools, and the vast majority of the rest will be out of school due to financial difficulties. In primary schools, more than 50 of the 212 municipal national schools have had their school buildings taken back by landlords, who are renting them out again at higher prices. If this problem cannot be solved, more than 10,000 poor primary school students will also be out of school as a result.

　　蒋区人民热望解放军反攻决心展开全面性反蒋斗争
  　上海文萃业刊测验民意
    【新华社陕北十二日电】备受蒋匪迫害的进步刊物沪文萃丛刊近在第七期发表该刊主办和平问题民意测验结果，参加者共三百零三人，包括蒋管区工农、学生、摊贩、商人、公教人员、家庭妇女、警察、军人、（其中有八个空军人员），遍及京、沪、平、津、川、滇等地。问题：（一）我们需要怎样的和平？赞成澈底摧毁反动派的统治，实现彻底的持久和平的二九九人，占总数百分之九八·六。（二）怎样达到你所需要的和平？主张强迫反动派放下武器的二九一人，占总数百分之九六，具体的意见是一方面争民主的主力——人民军队的军事胜利，实行大规模反攻，彻底消灭好战的反动派，另一方面是国民党统治区全民一致奋起发展全面性的反内战、反饥饿斗争，实行工人罢工、学生罢课、教员罢教、商人罢市、“国（蒋）军”官兵罢战，并实行抗丁、抗粮、抗税等武装起义。（三）怎样保障真正永久民主的和平？保障和平的力量在那里？对于破坏和平者应如何处理？其中二九四人，占总数百分之九七，认为保障和平的力量在中国全国人民、中共及其他民主党派手里。主张彻底摧毁反动派反民主力量与一党独裁制度，没收四大家族财产，驱逐无耻美军，取消一党的“国大”及其通过的“宪法”，公审战犯特务头子并处以极刑。
    【新华社陕北十二日电】蒋政府统治下的北平，被合众社记者形容为“阴垂死的城市”，据该社北平九日电报导：北平已实行戒严，军警奉令认为市民从事“可疑”活动时，即可随意开枪。机场由军警严密守卫着，除了（蒋）政府大员与蒋军们的汽车外，民用汽车均停在铁丝网外。飞机乘客被全副武装骄横的士兵拦住严密而又琐碎的检查。因为缺乏煤，所以时常停电，市面显得寒冷而黑暗，夜晚九时以后就寂静得象乡村一样。粮荒的恐怖在弥漫着，物价一直在上腾。
    【新华社陕北十日电】平报讯：平市秋季入学试验中公立中学投考人数与取录人数的比例，充分反映出今日“文化城”青年失学问题的严重。在生活困难与私立中学收费激涨下，一般中产人家均令其子弟投考公立中学，俾得勉强维持学业。本年度秋季投考市立各中学高中学生共八、二五四人，初中二○、三○六人，取录人数高中为一、二三○人，初中为一、三一○人，高初中取录人数仅为投考人数百分之八点八，在取录者以外，其余二六、○二○人中除极少数家境富裕者可望转入私立中学外，其余绝大多数将因经济困难而告失学。小学方面，市立国民学校二一二所中，五十余所校舍被房东收回，以较高租钱另租，此一问题如不能解决，为数逾万的穷苦小学生亦将因之而失学。
