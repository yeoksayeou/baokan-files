　　Curbing Landlord Sabotage
  　Beiliu Peasants Devise Methods

　　[This Newspaper Report] Liu Changgui, a landlord and special agent in Beiliu Village, Licheg county, conspired to assassinate cadres and activists, and openly agreed with his wife that after his death, she should marry the deputy director of the militia committee in order to find an opportunity to poison and kill the cadres to avenge him. The peasants were extremely resentful and unanimously said: We should overthrow the paralyzing thought that everything is fine after the land reform, and everyone should be vigilant and strictly manage the landlords. When the turn-over group held a meeting, the peasants decided to classify the twenty-three landlord households into three categories for management: the first category is landlord special agents, the second category is general landlords, and the third category is feudal rich peasants. The management methods discussed by everyone are: a management committee is established with the main cadres of the production committee. Management methods for category one, landlord special agents: 1. They must participate in mutual aid group labor and must not engage in speculative production, in order to actively repay the peasants' blood and sweat debts. 2. The rights to speak, vote, elect, and be elected are revoked. 3. In terms of scope of action: generally, all men, women, old and young in the family are not allowed to leave the village. No one can approach the special agents. If contact is necessary, it must be approved by the security group management committee, and peasants must supervise the conversation in person. The special agents cannot work alone. To borrow something, first ask at the door, and take it into the house after the peasants allow it, to prevent accidents. Relatives who are special agents are not allowed to interact at all. If they are general peasants and have special matters, they must have a letter of introduction and a travel permit (stamped by the five main cadres). If it is confirmed that they are not reactionary and do not engage in sabotage, and are handling legitimate matters, appropriate leniency may be given, and they should be dealt with quickly. They should immediately rest at home after the first bell rings at night. Those who are found not resting after the second bell will be strictly investigated and dealt with. Management of category two households: The methods are the same as for category one households. The period is tentatively set at five years. After the period expires, if they can truly bow their heads to the peasants, the peasants will discuss and stipulate separately. The management method for category three households is: the strict management period is set at one year. After the period expires, if they can truly bow their heads to the peasants, the peasants will temporarily discuss and decide separately. The control law generally applies the above methods, but they have the right to offer opinions, but no right to vote, elect, or be elected. Generally, they are not allowed to leave the village. If necessary, they can leave with approval with a travel permit and letter of introduction, and return on the same day. Every peasant has the right to supervise and manage. It is necessary to form a system of everyone managing. If non-compliance is discovered, everyone has the right to arrest and hand over to the management committee for handling. (Lü Duan, Pei Yi)

　　[Another Report] Beiliu Village has also formulated methods to resolve the issue of equal value in mutual aid between peasants and landlords. After the land reform, landlords and peasants earn the same wages in both agriculture and sideline occupations. The surplus labor in the mutual aid group must also be marked in red, while the landlords have more surplus labor due to the reduction of land, and they do not pay corvee or participate in the war. In addition to planting their own land, they use their surplus labor to earn a lot of money and millet from the peasants in agriculture and sideline occupations. According to the statistics of three landlord households in this village: the wages earned in seven months can buy sixteen dan and eight dou of millet. This shows that the landlords have not yet repaid the debts they owe the peasants, but are instead absorbing the peasants' wages in production. The peasants reflected: "The landlords do not pay corvee or participate in the war, and only earn wages from the peasants." Based on this situation, everyone discussed the following methods: (1) Landlords cannot continue to find easy jobs in cooperatives, workshops, and factories, or engage in small-scale sales and other production. They should participate in mutual aid groups (women's weaving groups) and work hard to repay the peasants' blood and sweat debts. All the landlord's surplus labor cannot be marked in red. As long as the landlords work hard to maintain the minimum standard of living, the principle is that wages should be reduced to one-third of the peasants' equal value (working for poor peasants), or one-half (working for middle peasants), that is, the current wage for peasants is five jin of rice without meals, while landlords should only get one jin and ten liang or two and a half jin of millet. (2) When landlords and peasants help each other with labor exchange, wages are reduced by one-half to one-third. However, when peasants work for landlords, wages remain unchanged (the same method applies to textile mutual aid). (3) Landlords of corvee age should compensate the peasants for corvee labor, since the peasants are paying corvee and participating in the war for them. The standard should be the actual corvee paid by each labor of the peasant each month, so that the landlord should pay two workdays for each corvee workday. (Because in addition to labor, participating in the war requires an average of about 500 yuan in meal expenses per day. In fact, it is equal to one day's wages for the peasant.) The landlords should also repay the corvee labor and mutual aid labor owed as soon as possible.

　　制止地主破坏活动
  　北流农民定出办法
    【本报讯】黎城北流村地特刘长桂阴谋暗杀干部积极分子，并坦白地和他女人约定，他死后要他女人嫁给武委会副主任，以便找寻机会以毒药杀害干部，为他报仇。农民痛恨万分，大家一致说：咱们应打倒过去土改后万事大吉的麻痹思想，大家提高警惕，严格的管理起地主来。翻身组开会时，农民便确定把二十三户地主划为三类来管理，第一类为地主特务。第二类为一般地主。第三类为封建富农。大家讨论出的管理办法是：以生产委员会中之主要干部成立管理委员会。对一类户地特的管理办法：一、必须参加互助组劳动不能做投机生产，以积极劳动继续偿还农民血汗债。二、取消发言、表决、选举、被选举权。三、行动范围上：全家男女老幼一般不准出村。任何人不能接近地特，必须接谈时，须经治安组管委会批准，有农民监视当面接谈。地特不能单独做活。借东西先在门口问过，经农民允许再进家拿取，以防意外。亲戚如系地特，则根本不能往来，如系一般农民而有特殊事情者，必须持有介绍信、路条（五大干部盖章），经检查在他不反动不破坏办理正当事情的情况下，可酌情给予宽待，速办速走。夜间打头次钟应立即在家休息，二次钟后查出不休息者则严格追究处理。对二类户的管理：方法与一类户同。暂定五年为期，期满后，如真正能向农民低头，则由农民另行讨论规定。对三类户的管理办法是：规定严格管理期为一年，满期后如能真正向农民低头，由农民临时讨论另行决定。管制法一般适用以上办法，但有提供意见权，没有表决、选举、被选举权。一般的不准出村，必要时经批准带上路条介绍信，当天出去当天回来。每个农民都有监视、管理权，要形成大家管理，如发现不执行情况，人人有权捉拿送交管委会处理。（履端、培义）
    【又讯】北流村并订出办法解决农民地主互助等价问题。土改后地主和农民无论在农业副业上都赚的是一样工资，在互助组的剩余劳力还要批红，而地主则因土地减少剩余劳力较多，又不支差参战，除种他的土地外均以剩余劳力在农副业上大量的赚去农民的钱财和小米。依据本村三户地主的统计：在七个月中所赚工资可买小米十六石八斗。这说明地主欠下农民的债还没有还清，反而在生产上吸取农民的工资。农民反映：“地主不支差不参战光赚农民的工资钱。”依据这样情况大家讨论出以下办法：（一）地主不能继续在合作社、作坊、工厂里找轻生活和做小贩等生产，应当参加互助组，（妇女纺织组）好好劳动，以劳动偿还农民的血汗债，地主的剩余劳力一律不能批红，只要地主好好劳动以维持最低限度的生活为原则，工资降低到农民等价的三分之一（为贫农做活），或二分之一（为中农做活），即现在农民每工不管饭五斤米地主只应得一斤十两或二斤半小米。（二）地主与农民互助变工时，工资降低二分之一至三分之一。但农民给地主做活时，工资不变（纺织互助亦同上办法）。（三）地主在支差年龄者，因农民替他支差参战，所以地主应偿还农民的支差工，以农民每月每个劳力实支差为标准，让地主一个差工还二个工。（因参战除出劳力外，每天平均需贴盘费五百元左右。实际上等于农民一天的工资）地主并应尽速还支差工和互助欠下的工。
