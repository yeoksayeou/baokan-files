Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th: Moscow Dispatch: The Franco-Soviet Trade Union Committee, established in January 1945, held its third session in the Soviet capital from September 9th to 11th. The French representatives attending the meeting included Stonehouse, Secretary-General of the French General Confederation of Labor (CGT), Vice Secretary-General Flachon, and Secretary Sagnan. The Soviet side was represented by Kuznetsov, Chairman of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions (AUCCTU), Secretary Solovyov, and six others. The meeting exchanged information on the activities of the trade unions of the two countries and decided to further strengthen the ties between them. After the meeting, the French representatives also visited Leningrad and Stalingrad. On the 17th, Stonehouse, the chief French representative, left the Soviet capital. Before his departure, at the request of a reporter from the Soviet "Labor News," he answered several questions. Stonehouse stated that the purpose of the Franco-Soviet Trade Union Committee is to consolidate the cooperation and unity of the workers' organizations of the two countries and to consolidate the fraternal friendship between the working people of the two countries. Regarding the issue of trade union unity in France, Stonehouse stated that organizational merger between the CGT and the French Confederation of Christian Workers (CFTC) is no longer possible because the leaders of the "CFTC" refused to do so. However, the unity of French workers has not encountered a crisis because of this. Stonehouse stated that the American Federation of Labor (AFL) attempted to organize a special central institution in Paris to oppose the unity of the European trade union movement, but due to our vigorous opposition, this center has not been established in Paris.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th: TASS, Moscow: The third session of the Franco-Soviet Trade Union Committee has issued a resolution, which states in brief: We confirm the following most important facts in the current international situation: (1) Reactionary forces in various countries are currently intensifying their offensive against the rights of the working people, trade union freedom, and living standards; (2) International monopoly capital groups are actively supporting the reactionary fascist regimes in Greece and Spain, fueling the civil war in China, and fueling the colonial war in Indonesia; (3) The U.S. government and certain governments in Latin America, such as Brazil, have promulgated or passed measures to suppress trade union rights and labor freedom. France also experienced such attempts, but due to the unity of the French working people, embodied through the French CGT, these attempts were defeated; (4) Monopoly capitalists, in order to seek markets for goods and investment and to seize raw material resources, seek to control the entire world, using false declarations of safeguarding democracy as a smokescreen, and even engaging in the evil act of instigating war; (5) Reactionaries attack and oppose the Soviet Union because the Soviet Union is an unyielding defender of the peace, democracy, and freedom of the working people, and the Soviet Union exposes the warmongers. Reactionaries want to split the international solidarity of the working class to achieve their reactionary goals. The meeting is deeply aware of this international situation and the position that the Franco-Soviet Trade Union Committee must adhere to, and now announces:

(1) The Franco-Soviet Trade Union Committee will do its utmost to resist the offensive of the reactionaries, tirelessly expose the warmongers, and, regardless of all obstacles, continue to strengthen the unity of labor and other progressive forces, and strive for world peace and social progress.

(2) The trade unions of France and the Soviet Union will continue to pursue a policy of cooperation between the people of the two countries in the spirit of the Franco-Soviet Treaty of Alliance and Mutual Assistance of December 10, 1944.

(3) Continue to trust the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) and provide assistance to all its activities.

(4) The Franco-Soviet Trade Union Committee will continue to work in accordance with the resolution of the WFTU Prague Congress on the democratization of Germany, demanding the nationalization of German heavy industry, joint control of the Ruhr by the four powers, the payment of reparations by Germany, and the adoption of other measures to ensure the security of France and the Soviet Union.

The meeting also decided to exchange four delegations this year and next year to enhance understanding between the central organizations of the trade unions of the two countries and between the trade unions of the two countries and to consolidate their ties. The meeting concluded by stating that the close cooperation between the working men and women of France and the Soviet Union will enhance the ties and understanding between the people of the two countries and will become a permanent factor in the peaceful happiness and free advancement of the working people of all countries.

    团结国际劳工反对战争贩子
    【新华社陕北二十日电】莫斯科讯：成立于一九四五年一月的法苏职工委员会，于九月九日至十一日在苏京召开其第三届会议。出席会议者法方为法国总工会总书记石屋，副总书记佛拉商，书记赛南等，苏方为苏联职工会中央委员会主席库兹涅佐夫，书记索洛维埃夫等六人。会议曾交换两国职工会活动的情报；并决定进一步加强两国职工会的联系。法方代表于会后并赴列宁格勒及斯大林格勒等地游历。十七日法方首席代表石屋离开苏京，事前应苏“劳动报”记者之请，答复若干问题。石屋称：法苏职委会的目的在于巩固两国工人团体的合作与团结，并巩固两国劳动人民间的兄弟之谊。关于法国职工统一问题，石屋称：总工会与基督教劳工联盟间组织上的合并，已无可能。因为“基联”的领导人拒绝这样做。但法国职工统一并未因此遭遇危机。石屋称：美国劳联企图在巴黎组织特别中心机构，以反对欧洲职工运动的统一，但由于我们有力的反对，此中心尚未在巴黎建立起来。
    【新华社陕北二十日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：法苏职工委员会第三届会议顷发表决议略称：我们确认目前国际时局中下列最重要的事实：（一）各国反动势力目前已对劳动人民的权利、工会自由及生活程度加紧其攻势；（二）国际垄断资本集团正积极支持希腊和西班牙的反动法西斯政权，助长中国的内战，助长在印尼的殖民战争；（三）美国政府以及拉丁美洲某些政府，如巴西已颁布或通过压制工会权利及劳工自由的措施，法国亦曾发生此种企图，但由于法国劳动人民经过法国总工会而体现的团结一致，击败了此种企图。（四）垄断资本家为寻求商品与投资市场及攫取原料资源，力求控制全世界，而以保障民主的虚伪声明为其烟幕，甚至在从事挑拨战争的恶劣行为。（五）反动派攻击与反对苏联，因为苏联是劳动人民和平民主自由的不屈不挠的保卫者，苏联揭发了战争贩子。反动派想要分裂劳工阶级的国际团结，达成其反动的目的。会议深知此种国际局势及法苏职工会所要坚持的立场，今宣布：
    （一）法苏职工会将竭尽努力反抗反动派的攻势，不懈地揭露战争贩子，并将不顾其一切阻挠，继续加强劳工及其他进步势力的团结，为全世界的和平及社会进步而斗争。
    （二）法苏两国职工会继续本着一九四四年十二月十日法苏同盟互助条约的精神，进行两国人民的合作政策。
    （三）继续信任世职，并对其一切活动予以帮助。
    （四）法苏职工会将依照世职布拉格大会关于德国民主化的决议，继续努力，要求德国重工业国有化，鲁尔由四强共管，德国必须交付赔偿，及采取其他保证法苏安全的措施。
    会议并决定今年与明年内交换四个代表团，以增进两国职工会中央机构及两国工会间的了解与巩固其联系。会议最后声明：法苏两国劳动男女人民间的紧密合作，将增强两国人民的联系与了解，并将成为一切国家劳动人民和平幸福与自由向前发展的永久因素。
