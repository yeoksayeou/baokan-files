    September 18th in Yangyi
    A Record of the Great Counter-Offensive Propaganda Week
    On the morning of September 18th, Yangyi Town in Wu'an was like celebrating the New Year. The streets and alleys were swept especially clean, and the shops all hoisted national flags and hung red lanterns. Many cloth banners were stretched across the streets north and south, facing the morning sun in a blaze of red, particularly bright and vibrant. The most shameful and darkest day in Chinese history caused by the traitor Chiang Kai-shek had completely changed its complexion.
    The large characters on the horizontal cloth banners and the red slogans on the walls told everyone: The People's Liberation Army's all-out counter-offensive has begun! The days of overthrowing the traitor Chiang Kai-shek and establishing a national democratic coalition government are not far off!
    In the morning, schools and theater troupes posted large counter-offensive situation maps, which they had rushed to paint overnight, in nine gathering places for residents on the main streets. Explanations were given to everyone: "Here is Huang'an, here is Hankou, Nanjing; here is Tuanxiang, here is Tongguan!" Young people shouted excitedly, "It's only one hundred and fifty miles from Nanjing!" The old people nodded, "It's not far! That's great!" Many people discussed, "I thought Chiang Kai-shek was always on the offensive, who knew he would become defensive?" Some people who had participated in the war around Antang said that Chiang Kai-shek's army was like the puppet troops, not able to withstand a fight, collapsing at the first blow, capturing people if they didn't fight. Others said that Chiang Kai-shek was seeking his own death and should be captured and subjected to a thousand cuts, so he wouldn't die well. Someone asked when Chiang Kai-shek could be captured, and whether the masses would be allowed to dispose of him as they pleased. A middle-aged man said anxiously, "Let's hold a mass meeting quickly!" Loud gongs and drums were heard from five or six locations, probably preparing for the Yangge dance.
    After lunch, more than two thousand people gathered in the square in front of the stage in the town. Here, too, large characters as red as a battle flag were written: "Down with Chiang Kai-shek," "National Counter-Offensive." A large cartoon titled "The Road to Victory" depicted a PLA soldier holding a rifle high, stepping on the tiny, rat-like Chiang Kai-shek, and walking along the main road towards the gate of an independent and free New China. Next to it were many victory reports.
    Upon hearing the news that more than twenty county towns had been recovered on the north bank of the Yangtze River in Hubei, Henan and Anhui, and nine county towns had been recovered in western Henan, and that the counter-offensive had begun on all battlefields across the country, people in every corner of the venue scrambled to speak. Representatives of merchants on the main street and several children's representatives, some wanted to ensure that military families had "three no difficulties" in farming, firewood, and water, and some wanted to help military families write letters to their relatives on the front lines to encourage them to fight; male and female military family members loudly reported that they now had good houses and land, and had nothing to worry about, cadres and the masses treated them very well, and preferential treatment for military families was truly well done. They asked to write letters on behalf of their sons and brothers who were going to war, telling them to fight Chiang Kai-shek well, protect the good times, or liberate the people across the country. Meng Youhe, a military family member from North Street, said, "My brother went to fight, I can work, I want to farm myself, don't need substitute farming; I also want to carry stretchers in the war." Jia Mi, a female military family member and textile expert from West Street, said, "My son joined the army to fight, I lead women in the rear to spin and weave, the front and rear do our own thing, write a letter to tell him I am very happy, don't worry about anything, it will be peaceful when Chiang Kai-shek is overthrown." Another person talked about the many hardships before last year, and this year they have truly turned over. Labor hero Meng Chenggui called on everyone to work hard to produce more wheat to guarantee the military and civilian food needs of the great counter-offensive. Because there were too many people speaking, the chairman finally politely stopped them.
    An old man sitting on the east side of the venue told me: The great counter-offensive will surely be victorious, his reason being that "the masses are all of one mind," which means "there will never be failure." Another old man told me: It's not that there are no hardships: for example, corvée labor may be a bit heavy. "However, when I think about the complete peace that can be achieved by eliminating Chiang Kai-shek, and that everyone can be reunited, I don't feel any hardship!"
    When the gongs and drums of the grand parade after the meeting rang out, many costumed young people and children became the focus of attention for the masses. They jumped, twisted, and posed, appearing particularly active. Among them, a "mute dance" led by gongs and drums attracted the most attention from the masses, and the streets were packed with people watching. It was five young people: one wearing a large red nose, a suit and boots, a top hat, carrying a large air pipe on a bicycle, with a large white strip on his back that said "American Imperialism"; the rest were "Traitor Chiang Kai-shek," in a yellow wool military uniform; "Chiang's brother-in-law Soong Tzu-wen," in a top hat and long robe; "Hooligan Boss Kung Hsiang-hsi," and "Secret Agent Boss Chen Lifu," both in suits. Throughout the parade, Chiang kept falling down, his American father kept pumping him up with the air pipe, Chen and Kung kept dragging Chiang to try to hold him up, but he fell down again, so they had to pump him up again, looking utterly ridiculous, and the masses mocked: "He can't get up, he's done for!"
    In the evening, I went to sit idly in the home of a woman in her forties who was a military family member. I asked her "Why haven't you started cooking?" She said: "Oh dear, I forgot, I was just too happy!" The Seventh District Office, consciously to prevent "just being happy and neglecting work," immediately began to arrange the autumn harvest and autumn plowing, expand wheat planting, and strengthen the counter-offensive force.
    In the evening, the gongs and drums rang out again, and the town's theater troupe began performing plays to celebrate the great counter-offensive. (Ér Dōng)

    九月十八日在阳邑
    大反攻宣传周散记
    九月十八日清早，武安阳邑镇象过大年一样，大街小巷扫得特别干净，商号都插起国旗，挂起红灯，南北对门横扯起许多布匾，迎着朝日一片红，分外鲜艳。卖国贼蒋介石所造成的中国历史上这个最可耻、最灰暗的日子完全变了色相。
    横布匾上的大字与墙壁上的红色标语告诉所有的人：人民解放军的全面大反攻已经开始了！打倒卖国头子蒋介石，成立全国民主联合政府的日子已经不远了！
    上午，各学校、剧团把连夜赶画的大幅反攻形势图贴到了大街上九个街民聚会之处，说明员给大家解释着：“这儿是黄安、这儿就是汉口、南京；这儿是团乡，这儿就是潼关！”年轻人高兴得大声吵叫：“离南京一百五十里！”老人们点点头：“就是不远了！可好了！”许多人纷纷议论：“我以为蒋介石就总是进攻哩，谁知道他也成了守势？”有的人在安汤一带参过战，都说蒋介石那队伍跟皇协军一样，不经打，一打就垮，不打就抓，也有人说蒋介石是自己找死来的，应该捉回来千刀万刮，叫他不得好死。有人追问几时能把蒋介石捉回来，捉回来是否归群众随意处置。一个中年人焦急的说：“赶快开大会吧！”有五、六个地点传出响亮的锣鼓声，大概是在准备秧歌舞哩。
    午饭后，二千多人集中在镇里戏台前的广场上。这儿也是一片大红斗一样的大字写着“打倒蒋介石”，“全国大反攻”。一张题名“胜利之路”的大漫画，画着一个高举步枪的解放军人，脚踏着瘦小如鼠的蒋介石，顺大路走向独立自由的新中国大门。旁边是许多捷报。
    听到长江北岸鄂豫皖收复二十多座县城与豫西收复九座县城及全国各战场都开始反攻的消息，会场各个角落都争着要求说话了。大街商人代表和好几个儿童代表，有的要保证军属种地、烧柴、吃水“三不难”，有的是要帮助军属给前线的亲人写信，鼓舞作战；男女军属们大声报告他们现在有了好房好地，啥也不发愁了，干部和群众待咱很好，优抗确实优好了，要求给出征子弟代写封信，叫他们好好打蒋介石，保卫好时光，或是解放全国老百姓。北街军属孟有河说：“我兄弟打仗去了，我能劳动，我要自己种地，不要代耕；参战抬担架，我也要顶一个。”西街女军属纺织能手贾密的说：“俺儿参军打仗，我在后方领导妇女纺织，前后方，各干各的，写封信告诉他我很高兴，啥也不用结记，打倒蒋介石回来就太平了。”还有一个说到去年以前的许多苦处，今年是真翻身了。劳动英雄孟成贵号召好好生产多种麦，保证大反攻军需民食。因为说话的人太多，主席最后婉言制止了。
    坐在会场东面的一个老头告诉我：大反攻一定胜利，他的理由是“群众都一条心”了，这就“永没失败”。另一个老人告诉我：苦处也不是没有：好比说，差役就得重一点。“不过，一想到消灭了蒋介石能得个彻底太平，人也都能团圆，就啥也不觉苦了！”
    会后大游行的锣鼓响起来时，许多化了装的青年儿童成为群众注目的中心。他们蹦跳着，扭着，出着相，显得特别活跃。其中有一队锣鼓引头的“哑舞”最为群众注目，沿街都水泄不通地挤着看。那是五个青年：一个装置着大红鼻头，西装统靴，高筒礼帽，手提脚踏车上的大气管，背贴“美帝国主义”大白条；其余是“卖国头子蒋介石”，黄呢军服；“蒋贼小舅子宋子文”，礼帽长袍；“恶霸头子孔祥熙”，“特务头子陈立夫”，均西装。一路游行，蒋一直往倒跌，他的美国爸爸一直用气管猛力打气，陈、孔一直拖拉蒋贼，想扶住他，但又跌倒了，只好再打气，丑态百出，群众嘲笑：“打不起来了，不行了！”
    傍晚，我进一个四十来岁的女抗属家闲坐。我问她“为啥还不做饭”；她说：“啊呀忘了，光顾高兴哩！”七区公所有意识地为了防止“光顾高兴，放松工作”，马上开始布置秋收秋耕、扩大种麦，增强反攻力量。
    晚间锣鼓又大响起来，镇上的剧团开始演戏来庆祝大反攻。（而东）
