Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 21st. War situation in various parts of Northeast China: (1) In Daxinzhuang, southeast of Tangshan, Jidong, a part of the KMT-puppet 166th Regiment, numbering over 400, raided more than ten villages including Tanggou, south of the Beining Railway, on the 9th to seize grain and conscript men. They were intercepted by our local forces and completely defeated. Ninety enemies were killed or wounded, and the enemy deputy battalion commander Zhou Huichuan and over forty others were captured. A portion of weapons were seized, and all arrested youths were rescued. (2) In Fengrun, Jidong, local armed forces routed over eighty KMT bandits of the "local gang" between Huangzhuang and Michang, forty miles south of Tangshan, on the morning of the 9th, killing or wounding twenty of them. (3) Over a hundred KMT bandits from the Xiwanzai stronghold in Chongli, Chahar South, and over thirty puppet security team members from the county, raided Touhaogou and other places separately on August 13th and 15th, but were routed by the local guerrillas. Many bandits were killed or wounded. Last month, the KMT bandits launched five raids, all of which were intercepted by local soldiers and civilians, suffering losses and fleeing back to their strongholds. Now, the remaining bandits in the county are isolated in their strongholds and dare not move again. (4) A part of our local forces in Rehe West attacked the KMT-puppet security team at Xiayingzi, sixty miles north of Longhua, on the 2nd, killing or wounding some of them, capturing twenty-seven, and seizing twenty-eight rifles and other weapons.
