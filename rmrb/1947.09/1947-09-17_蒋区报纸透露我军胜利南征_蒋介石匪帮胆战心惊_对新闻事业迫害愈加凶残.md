Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th—Because of disastrous military defeats and political bankruptcy, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang is becoming increasingly brutal in its destruction and persecution of the news media in the Chiang-controlled areas. The Guiyang Li Du newspaper once revealed news of the Chinese Patriotic Self-Defense War. For example, on September 6, the newspaper published a Nanjing dispatch entitled "Looking at the Recent War Situation from the News of Various Newspapers in Nanjing and Shanghai," which quoted the Shanghai newspaper's report on the victorious advance of "General Liu Bocheng's Southern Expeditionary Army" and excerpted the Shanghai newspaper's analysis, saying that one of the reasons for the development of the People's Liberation Army's strength was "the result of land reform increased the PLA's new blood." Just because it reported these universally recognized facts, the newspaper was accused by the Chiang bandits of "speaking for the Communist Party from time to time in its statements" (see the Chiang Kai-shek Central News Agency report) and was closed down on the morning of the 10th of this month. This shows to what extent the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang fears the facts and fears the people. In the past three months, the news industry in the Chiang-controlled areas (including some speech organs related to the officialdom) has been extremely devastated in the dying and frantic struggle of the Chiang bandits. According to incomplete statistics from all sides: from the end of June to the present, 39 speech organs have been persecuted, and many journalists have been beaten and arrested. On July 11, in Hankou alone, three daily newspapers, one evening newspaper, four weekly newspapers, one bi-monthly, and three monthly magazines were closed down. In the same month, Shanghai Modern News was confiscated when it was distributed, and Tianjin's Lu News was suspended for three days because of the headline "Communist Army Mistaken for National Army," and Ningbo Daily was suspended for three days because it published an article criticizing Chiang's conscription on June 26. Chongqing Business Daily was forced to suspend publication for one day due to reporting on grain price trends. Zhang Lingyun, director of the Qingdao Xinsheng News Agency, was arrested innocently on the morning of August 4. In July, six journalists in Fujian were detained for "exposing corruption in the Water Conservancy Bureau." Taiyuan's privately-owned Jinqiang Daily was stormed by all officers and soldiers of the Chiang bandit chief Qu Kongjun station on July 26 because it published news about peddlers setting up stalls. Editor Zhang Yan and reporter Zhang Huamin were severely injured in the beating with fists, feet, and clubs, and all equipment was destroyed. The Guangdong Meixian Republic Daily was destroyed by the Chiang bandit security police team on June 23, and one worker was seriously injured. More than a dozen secret agents carrying short guns broke into An Guangxin's Sheng Daily late at night on June 23. The president of the agency was beaten severely, the typesetting room and printing room were completely destroyed, and two watches and 230,000 yuan in Chiang currency were stolen. Of the 12 newspapers in Zhenjiang and Changshu that were forced to suspend publication due to Chiang bandits' control of foreign exchange restricting newspaper imports, eight were forced to stop publication, and seven in Tianjin, including Jianguo, Shehui, and Hebei News, and four in Changsha, including Xinchao Daily, Li Bao, Da Wan Bao, and Hunan Evening News.
