Protecting the Liberated Life
Elderly Woman Directs Flood Control Efforts on the Levee

[This dispatch from our newspaper in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region, dated the 22nd] To understand the flood prevention situation, starting from August 29th, this reporter investigated upstream along the Linhuang levee from Puyang County. I observed that the levee was four to six meters high, powerfully situated on both banks of the Yellow River, and every 200 meters there was a flood control dugout. On September 1st, when this reporter arrived east of Cengdian Village in the Ninth District of Changyuan County, I saw an elderly woman on the levee, gesturing and speaking to the flood control workers about preventing floods and protecting the levee. I found this strange, so I went to understand what was happening. It turned out she was from Cengdian, already 59 years old. Her husband, Liu Wenxiang, had led the work of preventing floods and protecting the levee for many years before the War of Resistance Against Japan. He fell ill from exhaustion while leading the masses in rescuing the levee at Xiaoqu in 1935, leaving her and her son, Liu Shuyin, without a way to make a living. At that time, the old government provided no relief, so she had no choice but to rely on the skills she learned from her husband to take over his job, managing a ten-li section of the levee at Cengdian, to support her family. Now that she has been liberated, she no longer relies on wages for food. But she told me, "Don't think I'm old. River management is for all the common people. I worked before, and I should work even harder for the common people now. My daughter and son-in-law are now squad leaders in the engineering team, and my son is also a member of the engineering team!" She pointed to the flood control workers and said to me, "They are all far from the river and have no experience, so I am here to teach them." This reporter deeply felt that with such a solid levee in the liberated areas, coupled with such enthusiastic masses working to prevent floods and save themselves, there is full confidence in overcoming the Yellow River if there is no destruction by the bandit Chiang.

    保卫翻身生活
    老太太上堤指挥防泛
    【本报冀鲁豫二十二日电】记者为了解防泛情形，于八月二十九日起，从濮县沿临黄堤往上游勘察，经过昆吾、濮阳、长垣各县，见大堤高四公尺至六公尺，雄踞于大河两岸，而每二百公尺，即有一个防泛窝棚。九月一日，记者行至长垣九区曾店村东时，见一老太太正在堤上比手划脚的对防泛员谈讲防黄护堤工作，我觉得奇怪，遂前往了解其究竟，原来她是曾店人，已五十九岁，她的丈夫叫刘文祥，在抗战前领导防黄护堤工作多年，于民国二十四年因在小渠领导群众抢险累病而死，撇她和儿子刘书印，母子二人生活无着，当时旧政府又无救济，不得已只得凭跟丈夫学得的本领，接替了丈夫的职务，担任曾店十里一段的工程，以靠维持一家生活。现在她翻了身，不靠工资吃饭，但她这样对我说：“别看我年纪老了，治河是为了大家老百姓，以前干，现更应该为老百姓干，我的闺女女婿现在在工程队当班长，我的儿子也当工程队队员呢！”她又指着那几个防泛员对我说：“他们都离河很远，没有经验，所以我在这里教给她们。”记者深感到解放区如此巩固的堤，再加上这样热烈防黄自救的群众，若无蒋贼的破坏，战胜黄水，是有充分把握的。
