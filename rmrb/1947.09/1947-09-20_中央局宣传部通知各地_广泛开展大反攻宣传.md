  　Widely Carry Out Propaganda for the Great Counter-Offensive
    [Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] The nationwide great counter-offensive has victoriously begun, and the national situation has entered a new stage. In order to unite the front and rear to overthrow Chiang Kai-shek, to mobilize our 36 million people in the entire region to actively support the front lines, and to strengthen the momentum of the counter-offensive, encourage the morale of the counter-offensive front lines and the hearts of the people nationwide, the Central Bureau Propaganda Department hereby notifies all regions to immediately conduct in-depth education and discussion in all systems based on the Xinhua News Agency's September 12th editorial "The People's Liberation Army Launches a Major Counter-Offensive" (published in the September 14th People's Daily) and the Forty Slogans of the People's Liberation Army issued by the Party Central Committee. Carry out extensive and in-depth propaganda among the masses, striving to make it known to every household and inspire everyone. Conduct political offensives in the enemy-occupied "white spots" in the border areas, striving to win people's hearts to our side and disintegrate the enemy. The notification calls for holding rallies in various forms in all systems, units, and among the masses to celebrate the great counter-offensive and the victory of our expedition; and mobilize military dependents and the families of civilian laborers accompanying the army, as well as cadres from counties, districts, and villages, to send letters to the expeditionary commanders and fighters and civilian laborers, reporting on family situations so that the counter-offensive commanders and fighters can concentrate on the counter-offensive, and the civilian laborers accompanying the army can concentrate on participating in the war. These types of family letters can be broadcast by the Handan Radio Station. Local newspapers and news agencies must vigorously organize the above news dispatches and telegrams and send them quickly.
