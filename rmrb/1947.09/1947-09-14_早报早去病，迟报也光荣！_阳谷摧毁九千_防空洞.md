　　"Report Early and Get Rid of Illness, Reporting Late is Also Glorious!"
　　Yanggu Destroys Nine Thousand "Air Raid Shelters"
　　[This newspaper's report from Jilu Yu, 12th] Yanggu County, through self-reporting for merit, accusation and solidarity methods, and ideological mobilization, has generally raised the masses' awareness. "Air raid shelters" are gradually being eliminated. Eight hundred villages in the county are involved in the self-reporting movement, and the number of "air raid shelters" initially destroyed has reached 9,665 households. According to statistics from the Eighth District, the reported property, in terms of clothing alone, is enough for everyone in the entire district to wear one item. The boundary between farmers and landlords has also been clarified through the process of pouring out grievances. In the self-reporting, many moving facts have emerged: For example, Li Xichen, a farmer from Sun Meng Liu Zhuang, handed over two landlord cousins who were hiding in his home to the masses for disposal during self-reporting. A model platoon leader of the militia from Xiao Fan Zhuang publicly exposed a special agent organization that had been hidden for several years and led the masses to uncover the underground chamber operated by the major special agent Hong Wujia. The upsurge of the self-reporting movement stems from the conscious demands of the peasants. As early as the beginning of the land reform, many landlords used vile means to threaten or soften the masses, preserving their property in order to divide peasant groups and retain a position of retreat. In addition, the initial stage of the movement suffered from poor ideological mobilization of the masses, and those who were fooled were extremely common. For example, in 70 villages in the Eighth District, out of 3,602 households, 1,140 households were acting as "air raid shelters" for landlords. In Yu Zhuang Village in the Second District, out of 136 households, 107 were acting as "air raid shelters." In Zhai Zhuang in the Fourth District and Xi Chenji in the Fifth District, the entire villages were "air raid shelters." Therefore, in the in-depth re-investigation, the above-mentioned peasants, on the one hand, due to the improvement of their awareness and inner condemnation, and on the other hand, fearing being labeled as "running dogs", experienced great emotional fluctuations, and even feared the landlords' counterattack, and were indifferent to the struggle. For example, a peasant in Liu Zhafu Wang Village hid two packages for the landlord. He was afraid of being labeled as "running dog" if he reported it, but if he didn't report it, he was afraid that the landlord would bite him if he was in a hurry. He was forced to secretly throw the package into someone else's yard at night. But the other person threw it back. It was thrown all over the southeast, northwest and everywhere, but the package was still in his own yard at dawn, making him cry. Another peasant in Yuan Zhuang Village hid a gun for the landlord, which made the mother and son sick. Farmers in Xi Chenji all hid things for the landlord, beating each other, making the whole village cry. In addition, more people threw away the things hidden for landlords in wells, sorghum fields, and temples. As a result, some villages, such as Jing Tang and Liu Ji, automatically abolished the method of labeling people "running dogs" and adopted the "voluntary reporting without coercion" approach. Later, the leadership accepted the experience of various places, and a self-reporting upsurge was formed throughout the county. The movement was carried out in steps such as accusation and model demonstration. The characteristics are: First, some people are still afraid of getting into trouble by reporting, so pointing out that their self-reporting is a credit to class consciousness has become an important prerequisite for the self-reporting movement. For example, a peasant in Xiao Fan Zhuang hid two pistols, one from the landlord of his village and one from the landlord of another village. When he first self-reported, he threw one pistol under a big tree. The Farmers' Association discovered it and hung a plaque of merit on the big tree to praise this anonymous hero. Seeing that nothing happened, he reported the other pistol the next day. Many farmers initially tried to report a little, and later, with continued encouragement, reported three or four times, elevating self-reporting from the masses' fear to a positive environment. "Reporting early is meritorious, reporting late is meritorious, thinking and reporting again is also meritorious," "Reporting early gets rid of illness early, reporting late is also glorious," completely waiting for the masses' consciousness with encouragement and praise. The second characteristic is that from beginning to end, the focus is on exposing the landlords and local tyrants. In each self-reporting, the peasants poured out the landlords' deception of them. After being exposed by the self-reporters, the landlords and local tyrants were completely exposed. After clearing the "air raid shelters," the masses suddenly realized, as the masses in Wang Zhuang said: "The landlord put things in our house because he wanted the Farmers' Association to label people 'running dogs'; if there are too many 'running dogs', the Farmers' Association will not be able to accomplish anything, only engage in civil war, and will have to disband." The understanding of the landlords suddenly improved. Even those who did not act as "air raid shelters" for the landlords, but who had previously sympathized with and felt sorry for the landlords in their minds, also aroused hatred for the landlords in the accusations and reported their thoughts to the masses.

### “早报早去病，迟报也光荣！”　阳谷摧毁九千“防空洞”

　　“早报早去病，迟报也光荣！”
  　阳谷摧毁九千“防空洞”
    【本报冀鲁豫十二日电】阳谷县通过自报立功，控诉团结方法，进行思想发动，群众觉悟普遍提高，“防空洞”逐渐消灭，全县八百个村子，卷入自报运动，初步摧毁的“防空洞”达九千六百六十五户。报出的财物，据八区统计，仅衣裳一项，即够全区每人分穿一件，农民与地主界线，也从诉苦中分清。在自报中，涌现出不少动人事实：如孙孟刘庄农民李西臣，把藏躲在他家中的二个表兄弟地主，于自报中转交群众处理。小范庄民兵模范班长，把隐秘数年的特务组织，当众揭露，引导群众破获大特务洪武甲经营的地下室。自报运动的掀起，系由于农民自觉的要求。远在土地改革之初，许多地主即以卑污手段，威胁或软化群众，为其保存财物，企图借此分化农民团体，保留退却阵地，加以运动初期，群众思想发动较差，受愚弄者极为普遍。如八区七十个村子的三千六百零二户中，当地主“防空洞”的就有一千一百四十户。二区于庄村一百三十六户，当“防空洞”的就有一百零七户。四区的翟庄、五区的西陈集，竟至全村都是“防空洞”。因此，在深入复查中，上述农民，一方由于觉悟的提高，内心的谴责，也有的害怕打“狗腿”，情绪曾起很大波动，甚至害怕地主反攻，而对斗争冷淡。如刘乍夫王村一个农民藏着地主的二个包袱，报出来怕打“狗腿”，不报出来怕地主被追急了咬出他，迫得夜里偷偷把包袱向别人院里扔，这边扔过去，别人又扔过来。东南西北扔遍了，天明包袱还在自己院子里，急得哭泣。远庄村另一个农民，藏着地主的一支枪，急得母子二人，都害了一场大病。西陈集农民，都藏有地主的东西，互相拷打，打得全村哭啼。此外，往井里，往高粱地，往庙里，抛弃地主藏东西的更多。于是有些村子，如井塘、刘集等村，便自动取消打“狗腿”办法，采取“自报不逼”的路线，后来领导上又接受各地经验，才在全县形成一个自报热潮，运动是以控诉表模等步骤进行的。其特点：第一、有些人仍怕报出来惹祸，所以指出他们这一自报是阶级觉悟的功绩，便成为自报运动的重要前提。如小范庄一个农民，藏着本村地主与外村地主的两支手枪，开始自报时，他先把一支手枪抛在大树底下，农会发觉了，便在大树上挂一块功臣牌，以赞扬这位无名功臣，他看见没事，又在第二天，把另一支手枪报出来。有许多农民，开始试探着报一点，后来在继续的鼓励之下，报出三次四次，把自报从群众畏惧的情绪中表扬起来，创造一个积极的环境。“早报是功，迟报是功，想想再报也是功”，“早报早去病，迟报也光荣”，完全以鼓励与表扬的方法，等待群众的自觉。第二个特点：是自始至终，集中锋芒对地主恶霸的揭露，农民们于每一次自报中，都倾诉地主对他们的愚弄，经过自报人揭发，终把地主恶霸完全暴露无遗。群众在扫清“防空洞”之后，恍然大悟，如在王庄群众说：“地主在咱家放东西，是想叫农会来打‘狗腿’；‘狗腿’多了，农会干不成，光打内战，只好散伙”。对地主的认识，骤然提高，即使没有当地主的“防空洞”，而以往在思想上怜悯与同情地主的人，也在控诉中激起对地主的仇恨，而向群众报出思想。
