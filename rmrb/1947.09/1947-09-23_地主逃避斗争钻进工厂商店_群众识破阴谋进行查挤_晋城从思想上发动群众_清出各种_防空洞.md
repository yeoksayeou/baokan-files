[This dispatch from Taiyue on the 21st] The Fourth District Industrial and Commercial Bureau led the effort to block landlords' "air-raid shelters" and purged a large number of struggle targets from Jincheng's industry and commerce. This began in the streets, shops, and factories of Jincheng City, and some experience was created. At the beginning of this movement in the urban area, there was a detour. At that time, the cadres first identified the targets of struggle and then collected their evil deeds from the masses. As a result, they visited door to door, but one family didn't know, and another didn't understand, and the answers were irrelevant. After reviewing this, the method was changed, and workers, shop assistants, and peasants who had not been thoroughly turned over were widely mobilized to hold large and small meetings to pour out their grievances. Many people shed tears when talking about being oppressed by landlords and bullies. Taking advantage of this激愤 (ji fen) emotion, the cadres inspired everyone to check the feudal forces hidden in factories and shops, launching a broad movement to search out feudalism. Another method was to have the stronger responsible comrades in each public store lead the entire store and factory to launch a feudal cleansing study, thereby squeezing out the feudal forces. With the combination of these two methods of investigation, a large number of struggle targets hiding in various production departments of shops and factories in various ways were discovered. For example, Yan Yongwen, director of the Donggou Office, was both a landlord and a Kuomintang agent. In order to escape the mass struggle, he burrowed into the office. Under his control, more than twenty of the thirty employees of the livestock exchange were targets of struggle, while five basic masses who served as traders were fired, and one trader was transferred to specifically serve his wife and children, and 40,000 yuan of public funds were given to a certain trader to engage in private production. The Yuhua Store has cleared out six targets of struggle. The cook of its silk weaving factory, Li Gusui, was originally a landlord businessman from Xiazhuang, Jincheng. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, he opened a restaurant in the city and had close ties with the Japanese. After the Japanese surrender, he transported all his property into the fields. Last March, seeing the booming mass movement, he sneaked into the Yuhua Store to cook, embezzling a fixed amount of one catty of salt, half a catty of oil, and 100 yuan of vegetable money every day. In addition, he forged the inspection stamp of the Industrial and Commercial Tax Bureau, so that the embezzlement reached as much as 470,000 yuan, and he oppressed workers to carry water for him, causing extreme resentment among the masses. In short, there were struggle targets everywhere in the city's large and small streets: for example, three of the six people in the Yiyong Store were targets of struggle; eight of the nine people in the Gongnong Store were targets of struggle, and all were cleared out. The treatment methods for the targets of struggle are generally divided into three types: (1) Those with the most serious circumstances, such as those from outside, are transferred to the masses in their original籍贯 (ji guan) through the government, and those from the local area are detained by the government and dealt with at a mass struggle meeting. (2) Those with minor circumstances are allowed to return to their place of origin to wash their faces and lower their heads to the masses. (3) Those with suspicious behaviors are helped to reflect. At present, there are fourteen or five people in each street who have been handed over to the masses for struggle. Only four people were struggled in the back street, and more than 10 million yuan of fruit was cleared out. After the cleaning, the work of various public stores and factories progressed smoothly, the morale of the cadres was immediately improved, and work efficiency also increased, while laying the foundation for the transformation of the Chamber of Commerce. During this mass movement, many activists were discovered, and the Chambers of Commerce of various towns have been completely transformed.

    地主逃避斗争钻进工厂商店
    群众识破阴谋进行查挤
    晋城从思想上发动群众
    清出各种“防空洞”
    【本报太岳二十一日电】四分区工商业务局领导堵塞地主“防空洞”，在晋城工商业中清洗了大批斗争对象。首从晋城市各街各商店工厂开始，并创造一些经验。这一运动在城关开始进行时，曾走了一段弯路，当时先由干部找出斗争对象，然后向群众搜集其作恶材料，结果挨门访问，这家不知道，那家不晓得，所问非所答。后来经检讨，才转变了此种方式，广泛的发动工人、店员、没有翻透身的农民，分别召开大小会议，进行诉苦，许多人谈到受地主恶霸的压榨时，声泪俱下。干部便趁此群情激愤时，启发大家检查隐藏在工厂商店中的封建势力，掀起了广泛的搜查封建运动。另外还有一种方式，便是以各公营商店里比较坚强的负责同志，领导全商店工厂展开清查封建学习，从而挤出封建势力。在这两种清查方式的结合下，发现了以各种各样方式隐藏在商店与工厂各个生产部门中的大批斗争对象。如东沟事务所主任阎永文，既是地主，又是个国民党特务，为了逃避群众斗争，而钻进了事务所。在他的掌握下，牲畜交易所三十余人便有二十多个斗争对象，而基本群众充当交易员者，则被开除五个，并抽调一个交易员专门侍候他的老婆与孩子，将公款四万元交给某贸易员为其私人搞生产。豫华商店已清查出的斗争对象有六个，其丝织工厂的伙夫李鼓手，原是个经营地主，晋城西下庄人，抗战期间在城内开饭馆，与日寇联系很密切，日寇投降后，便将所有财产运进地里。去年三月，看到轰轰烈烈的群众运动，便混进豫华商店做饭，每天固定的贪污一斤食盐、半斤油、一百元菜金；另外伪造工税局验戳，以致贪污竟达四十七万之多，并欺压工人为其挑水等，引起群众的极端愤恨。总之，全市街大大小小的斗争对象到处都有：如义永商店六人中，即有三人系斗争对象；工农商店九人中，即有八人系斗争对象，均被清查出来。对斗争对象处理办法大体上分为三种：（一）情节最重者，如外来的，即经政府转交原籍群众，当地的交政府扣押，在群众斗争大会上处理。（二）情节轻者，则让其回原籍向群众洗脸低头。（三）形迹可疑者，帮助其反省。目前交群众斗争者各街已有十四五人，仅后街斗争四人，即清算出果实达一千余万元。经过清洗之后，各公营商店及工厂工作顺利进行，干部的情绪顿时提高，工作效率也随着提高了，同时奠定了改造商联会的基础。此次在群众运动中，发现了不少积极分子，各镇的商联会已完全经过改造。
