    [This Newspaper, Taiyue, 22nd Dispatch] Following the capture of five cities including Xin'an, the armies of Chen, Xie, Han, Kong, and Qin captured five more cities including Lushi, Lingbao, and Shanzhou, annihilating over 10,000 enemy troops. Leaders of the Taiyue Military Region sent a congratulatory telegram stating: "Just as the people of the entire region are jubilantly celebrating the victory and actively supporting the Southern Expeditionary Army, another victory has been reported, annihilating over 10,000 enemy troops, which gives the people of Taiyue boundless encouragement. In addition to providing you with the greatest support in terms of manpower and materials, we have decided to launch a military and political offensive against the enemy to hold back and annihilate the Chiang bandits attempting to flee south, as a gift of congratulations for your further victory."

    [This Newspaper, Taiyue, 24th Dispatch] In order to organize a greater force to support the Chen-Xie army, Jincheng convened a meeting of war contribution heroes at the end of last month, proposing to the masses throughout the county to make contributions in every village, every person, and to add to their contributions during the counter-offensive. Immediately, a heated competition to participate in the war was launched between districts and districts, villages and villages, and heroes and heroes. First, District Three challenged District Seven, proposing "Three Fears Not": Not afraid of crossing the Yellow River, not afraid of the length of time, not afraid of sacrifice. "Four No's": Do not allow participating civilian laborers to encounter difficulties; do not violate mass discipline, obey mobilization, do not haggle over prices, and do not return until the task is completed. Then District Seven responded to the challenge, and in addition to implementing the conditions of District Three, they also proposed two guarantees: guarantee that participating civilian laborers will not leave an acre of land uncultivated, and will not reduce grain production; guarantee that participating civilian laborers will not run away. District Six, in addition to responding to District Three's "Three Fears Not", also proposed "Three Leading" and "Three No Leaving", challenging District Five. "Three Leading" are: the land of participating civilian laborers is planted first, participating cadres rush to the front first, and take the lead in rescuing the wounded on the front line. "Three No Leaving" are: do not leave until the task is completed, do not leave without compensating for damaged items, and do not leave in any circumstances without an order from a superior. Districts Two and Four also challenged District Five, and requested the county headquarters to act as guarantor. District Five accepted the challenge, and Liqinggou Village in District Seven challenged District Two, guaranteeing that participation in the war and production would not be neglected. District One also accepted the challenge. After the challenges, all challengers and responders wrote down their challenge letters and handed them over to the county headquarters for safekeeping. Finally, Guo Qun, a special-class hero among the civilian laborers, formulated a plan to make further contributions at the meeting: 1. Cultivate five heroes; 2. Rescue ten wounded on the front line; 3. Participate in the war until Chiang Kai-shek is overthrown. And called on everyone to cross the Yellow River, go to the front line to make contributions, and liberate the people across the country. Immediately afterward, district and village cadres also announced their personal plans to make contributions. Currently, there are ××× civilian laborers in the county waiting to be dispatched.

    [This Newspaper, Taiyue, 24th Dispatch] Under the slogan of "Rooting out the old scourge, Chiang Kai-shek," liberated peasants in Huo County saw 2,402 young men and women automatically sign up to join the army in a matter of hours. After the news of the Southern Expedition's victory reached the county, a counter-offensive mobilization meeting was held on September 8. At the meeting, Comrade Guan Ziping, Secretary of the CPC County Committee, told everyone: "Our liberated areas have already begun a major counter-offensive, and the Liu-Deng army has reached the Yangtze River, capturing many cities. In order to ensure that victory arrives sooner, I call on all Communist Party members and outstanding youths in the county to voluntarily join the army and root out the old scourge, Chiang Kai-shek!" Immediately, the entire venue was a sensation. Amidst loud slogans, young people flocked to the stage to sign up, and countless touching stories of fathers sending sons, wives sending husbands, and brothers vying to join the army emerged on the spot. An old man from Yangzao Village in District Two wanted to join the army with his two sons, and an old woman from Lijiafen Village in District Three sent both her son and younger son to join the army. The crowd of people signing up continued non-stop until it was too dark to see. Finally, it was announced that registration would continue the next day, and the meeting was temporarily adjourned.

    太岳大力支援南征大军
    晋城人民竞赛参战
    霍县二千青壮从军
    【本报太岳二十二日电】陈、谢、韩、孔、秦大军，继克新安等五城之后，再克卢氏、灵宝、陕州等五城，歼敌万余，太岳军区首长驰电祝贺称：“正当全区人民欢腾祝捷，并积极支援南征大军之时，捷报再传，歼敌万余，更给太岳人民以无限的鼓舞。我们除进一步从人力物力给你们以最大支援外，并决定展开对敌的军政攻势，拖住并消灭企图南窜的蒋匪，作为对你们进一步胜利的贺礼”。
    【本报太岳二十四日电】为组织更大的参战力量支援陈谢大军，晋城曾于上月底召开参战功臣大会，向全县群众提出了要在反攻中，村村表功、人人立功、功上加功。全县区与区、村与村、功臣与功臣立刻掀起了如火如荼的参战竞赛。首先三区向七区挑战，提出：“三不怕”：不怕过黄河，不怕时间长，不怕牺牲。“四不”：不叫参战民夫受到困难；不违犯群众纪律，服从调动，不讲价钱，完不成任务不回来。接着七区应战，除实行三区的条件外，又提出两个保证：保证参战民夫不荒一亩地，不少打粮食；保证参战民夫不逃跑一个。六区除响应三区的“三不怕”外，又提出“三带头”、“三不走”，向五区挑战。“三带头”是：参战民夫的土地种在头里，参战干部抢到头里，上前线抢救伤员带头。“三不走”是：不完成任务不走，损坏了东西不赔偿不走，在任何情况下没上级命令不走。二、四区亦向五区挑战，并请县指挥部作保，五区应了战，七区李清沟村向二区挑战，保证参战生产两不误。一区亦应了战。挑战后，各挑战应战者，都写下战书，交县指挥部保存，最后民夫特等功臣郭群同志，在大会上订出再立功计划：一、培养五个功臣；二、在火线上抢救十个伤员；三、参战一直到打倒了蒋介石为止。并号召大家，打过黄河，到前线立功去，解放全国老百姓。紧接着区村干部也都一一宣布了个人的立功计划，现全县已有×××名参战民夫，待命出动。
    【本报太岳二十四日电】霍县翻身农民，在“拔掉老祸根蒋介石”的口号下，数点钟内即有两千四百零二个青壮年，自动报名参军。自南征胜利消息传到该县后，即于九月八日召开反攻动员大会，会上中共县委书记关子平同志向大家说：“我们各个解放区，已经开始大反攻，刘邓大军进抵长江，打下许多城市。为使胜利能早日到来，我号召全县共产党员和优秀青年，自动参军，拔掉老祸根蒋介石！”当下全场便轰动起来，在响亮的口号声中，青年们蜂拥上台报名，当场涌现出了无数的父送子、妻送夫、兄弟抢着参军的生动故事。二区杨枣村一个老汉要和他两个儿子相跟着参军去，三区李家坟一个老太婆送他儿子少儿都参了军。拥挤着的报名人直到天黑得看不见时仍连续不绝。最后宣布，第二天继续报名，才算暂时休会。
