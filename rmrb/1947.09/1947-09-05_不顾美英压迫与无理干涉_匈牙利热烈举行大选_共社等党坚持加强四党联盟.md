　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st. Ignoring the pressure and unreasonable interference from the United States and the United Kingdom, Hungary held its parliamentary elections on schedule yesterday. More than 5.4 million men and women voters over the age of eighteen across the country, dressed in festive new clothes, sang and danced to polling stations to vote. According to Smith, director of the European News Department of Columbia Broadcasting Corporation in the United States: "The proportion of voters is higher than in any previous presidential election in the United States." The election results will produce a unicameral formal parliament to replace the recently dissolved provisional parliament. This is the second parliamentary election in the country since its liberation. In the last election, held on November 4, 1945, the Hungarian Communist Party, which had been underground for twenty-five years, won 27% of the total votes and became the third largest party in parliament, forming a four-party coalition government with the Smallholders Party, the Social Democratic Party, and the National Peasant Party; and the National Independence Front was established. For two years, the coalition government has made remarkable achievements in Hungary's political, economic, and cultural construction, especially after the exposure of the counter-revolutionary treasonous plot headed by Smallholders Party leader and Prime Minister Nagy in June this year. The democratic regime has been consolidated, and the Smallholders Party has gradually become unified due to the cleansing of right-wing upper-level elements.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 31st. Budapest Dispatch: The Hungarian parliamentary elections will begin today, and the election campaign has reached its peak. The nine political parties participating in the election, including the four ruling parties of the National Independence Front and five opposition parties, have held hundreds of mass pre-election meetings across the country every day. Hungarian Communist Party leader Rakosi, at a rally of ten thousand people in Debrecen, denounced the slander from reactionary elements at home and abroad that this election was undemocratic, saying: During the Horthy dictatorship, three million people were deprived of the right to vote, and no protests from the above-mentioned people were heard. This election only deprives hundreds of Horthy followers and some fascists of the right to vote, and at this time they are clamoring about it. At another meeting, Rakosi praised the four-party alliance and insisted on strengthening the cooperation of the four parties. Social Democratic Party leader Szakasits pointed out at a mass meeting convened by the party that it would cooperate with the Communist Party for a long time. Smallholders Party Chairman Dobi declared at a voters' meeting that he would continue to strengthen the four-party alliance after the election. Prime Minister Dinnyés pointed out that this election was held amidst the jealousy and slander of reactionary elements at home and abroad, but the enemy's attempt to split the two major groups of workers and peasants would never succeed.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th. On the eve of the democratic parliamentary elections in Hungary (August 31), the US and UK governments jointly protested to the Hungarian government, falsely claiming that the new Hungarian election law "deprives millions of citizens of the right to vote" and fabricating that the election organization "is controlled by the Communist Party." Hungarian Minister of Propaganda, Smallholders Party member Mihályfi, issued a statement on the 24th, strongly refuting this as "groundless rumors." Mihályfi pointed out: The voter list was compiled by an election committee composed of one person each from the Smallholders Party, the Communist Party, the Social Democratic Party, the National Peasant Party, and the Civic Democratic Party, which included not only representatives of the ruling parties, but also representatives of the opposition parties. Mihályfi continued: The current number of registered voters has reached 5,293,967, an increase of 129,326 from the 1945 election. Only 200,000 people are not on the list. Mihályfi finally stated: "I not only refute this move by the United States and the United Kingdom, but also lodge a protest."

　　不顾美英压迫与无理干涉
  　匈牙利热烈举行大选
    共社等党坚持加强四党联盟
    【新华社陕北一日电】不顾美英两国之压迫与无理干涉，匈牙利已按时于昨日举行国会大选，全国五百四十余万十八岁以上之男女选民，都穿着节日的新衣，载歌载舞拥往各地选举站投票。据美哥伦比亚广播公司欧洲新闻部主任司密斯报导：“选民人数之比例，较美国历届总统选举时为多。”选举结果将产生一院制之正式议会，以代替最近宣布解散之临时议会。按此次系该国解放后第二次国会大选。上次选举举行于一九四五年十一月四日，结果，处于地下状态二十五年之匈共竟获选票总数百分之二十七，成为国会第三大党，即与小农党、社会民主党、国家农民党组成四党联合政府；并成立民族独立阵线。二年以来，联合政府在匈牙利政治经济文化各方面之建设已获有卓著成就，尤以今年六月以小农党领袖内阁总理奈基为首之反动派叛国阴谋破获后，民主政权已趋巩固，小农党内部亦因右派上层分子之被清洗而渐趋统一。
    【新华社陕北三十一日电】布达佩斯讯：匈牙利国会大选将于今日开始，竞选运动已达最高峰。参加竞选之九个政党，包括执政之民族独立阵线四政党与五个反对党，在全国各地召开之群众预选大会，日达数百次。匈共领袖拉科西在德布勒森城之万人大会上，指斥国内外反动派所称此次选举不民主之谰言称：在霍尔第独裁时代，被剥夺选举权者达三百万人，未闻引起上述人士之任何抗议，此次选举仅剥夺数百霍尔第党徒及若干法西斯分子之选举权，此时居然大肆叫嚣。拉氏于另一次大会上盛赞四党联盟，并坚主加强四党之合作。社会民主党领袖斯札卡西克在该党召集之群众大会上指出：将与共产党长期合作。小农党主席道比在选民大会上宣言称：大选后仍坚持加强四党联盟。总理丁尼斯则指出此次选举乃在国内外反动派之嫉妒与诽谤中所举行，但敌人企图分裂工人与农人两大集团之阴谋决不能奏效。
    【新华社陕北三十日电】在匈牙利民主的国会大选（八月三十一日）前夕，美英两国政府竟联合向匈政府提出抗议，诬蔑匈新选举法“剥夺百万公民之选举权”，捏造选举机构“为共产党所把持”。匈宣传部长小农党员米海利夫，于二十四日发表谈话，力斥此为“毫无根据之谣言”。米氏指出：选民名单系由小农党、共产党、社会民主党、国家农民党及公民民主党各一人所组成之选举委员会所编制，其中不但有执政党之代表，且包括反对党之代表。米氏继称：目前已登记列入选民名单者达五百二十九万三千九百六十七人，已较一九四五年选举时增加十二万九千三百二十六名。未列入名单者仅二十万人。米氏最后力称：美英此举“我不仅予以驳斥，且将提出抗议”。
