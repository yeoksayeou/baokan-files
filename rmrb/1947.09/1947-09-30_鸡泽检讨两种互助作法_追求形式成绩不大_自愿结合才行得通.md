[This report transmitted from Hebei-Henan-Shandong Border Region on the 26th] From organizing universal production mutual aid to clarifying production mutual aid with poor peasants as the backbone; from emphasizing the combination of production and war to organizing mutual aid through voluntary association by the masses – these are the two major transformations in the Jize production movement.

At the beginning of spring production, the emphasis was on combining production with war, providing land cultivation on behalf of those who went to war, putting forward the slogan "Everyone participate in production, everyone participate in mutual aid," and using the Children's Corps' enthusiastic anti-lazybones approach to organize a large number of mutual aid teams. However, because the mutual aid teams absorbed landlords and those who were struggled against, mixed in negative elements, and lacked voluntary association, they showed laxity and weakness in subsequent drought resistance, rush planting, and weeding. The situation at the time was:

(1) Poor peasants were not the backbone of mutual aid production, and landlords were organized into the teams. Zhao's landlord family in Chengli South Street said in the mutual aid team: "Anyway, I'm done for. The struggle is against me, and you've taken the labor points away in the mutual aid. It's truly becoming communist!" They were consistently passive and destructive in production activities. On the other hand, due to the emphasis on each team having an ox and exchanging labor between people and animals, poor peasants asked middle peasants to join the team, and the middle peasants did not dare to refuse. Therefore, some middle peasants were forced to participate in mutual aid and were not active in production. Chang Dongtang's team in Li Ma Chang Village, a middle peasant, left the sesame cakes untouched and did not go to the fields. He said: "If I harvest more grain, others will have to share it. If I show my money, I will be struggled against!" With three types of people existing in such a team—landlords being passive in production or sabotaging production, middle peasants concealing wealth and not being active in production, and emancipated poor peasants wanting to become rich—how could production be improved when they were all dreaming different dreams? Instead, it lowered the production enthusiasm of the poor peasants who were pulled in, and they could not play a backbone role.

(2) After the enemy occupied Daming, a large number of laborers participated in the Henan-North Battle, which further emphasized the combination of production and war, and some villages formed a compulsory approach to organizing mutual aid, which reduced the role of mutual aid.

(3) Overly emphasizing the "large land-renting mutual aid" format and calling "large land-renting mutual aid" a thorough team, implicitly meant that other mutual aid formats were not thorough or good. In fact, as long as the mutual aid team has equal value exchange and no one suffers losses, it can be consolidated and solve production difficulties. Using only the "large land-renting mutual aid" method to organize the masses is dogmatism, and the masses will naturally find it difficult to accept. Village cadres were in great difficulty, and the result was not that the masses voluntarily participated in "large land-renting mutual aid," but simply did not participate in mutual aid.

Through the above review, we recognized the two lines in production mutual aid: one is formal mutual aid, with little increase in production; the other is a large increase in production, but the mutual aid format is scattered, and the exchange of labor is not clear enough on the value exchange, but the masses themselves agree with it. For example, Jiu Chengzhong has always been considered by us as not having mutual aid teams (i.e., mutual aid groups), but out of the 53 head of livestock in the village, 42 were bought by the masses together, and most of them were bought by grinding two or three dou of soybeans into flour to earn money. This kind of mutual aid team is based on poor peasants, and naturally this mutual aid format is very low; buying livestock is mostly helping with the legs or jointly buying, jointly feeding, and jointly using. There are many such mutual aid organizations around Gaozhuang, and we have now adopted this format.

    鸡泽检讨两种互助作法
    追求形式成绩不大
    自愿结合才行得通
    【本报冀南二十六日电】从组织全民生产互助，到明确以贫农为骨干的生产互助；从强调生产与战争结合，到群众自愿结合组织互助，这是鸡泽生产运动的两个大转变。一开春组织生产时，强调生产与战争结合，给出征人代耕，提出“人人参加生产，人人参加互助”的口号，及用儿童团热烈的反懒汉方式，组织起大量互助组。但由于互助组吸收了地主被斗户，混进了消极分子，又加缺乏自愿结合，在后来抗旱、抢种、锄苗中表现松懈无力，当时情况是：（一）互助生产中没有以贫农为骨干，将地主组织进来。城里南街赵家地主，在互助组里说：“反正我不行了，斗争是斗我，互助中你们又将工计走了，真是共产了！”一贯消极破坏生产活动；另一方面，由于强调了每组有牛使，人畜变工，贫农叫中农参加那组，中农即不敢拒绝，因此，中农有的是被迫参加互助，不积极生产。李马昌村常东堂组一个中农，放着麻饼不上地，他说：“多收了粮食，也得叫别人分，露出钱来，会被斗！”这样一个组里存在着三种人，地主在消极不生产或破坏生产，中农在隐蔽财富不积极生产，翻身贫农要求发家致富，三种人同床异梦，那能搞好生产呢？反而使贫农被拉的生产情绪低落，起不到骨干作用。（二）由于敌人侵占大名后，豫北战役大批劳力参战，更强调了生产与战动结合，某些村即形成带强制性组织互助的作法，降低了互助的作用。（三）过分强调了“大租佃互助”形式，称“大租佃互助”为彻底组，无形中就是说别的互助形式是不彻底的不好的，其实互助组里只要是等价交换、互不吃亏，就能巩固，就能解决生产困难。只用“大租佃互助”一个法子，去组织群众，正是教条主义，群众自然难以接受，村干作了大难，结果不是群众自愿参加“大租佃互助”，而是干脆不参加互助。我们经以上检讨，认识了生产互助中的两条路线，一是形式上互助，增产成绩不大，一是增产成绩大，但互助形式零散、换工等价上不够明确，群众自己赞成。如旧成中一向被我们认为没有互助组（即互助组），但该村五十三头牲口，就有四十二个是群众碰伴买的，且多是由二斗三斗豆子磨粉赚钱买来的，这种互助组是贫农为骨干的，自然这种互助形式很低，买牲口多是帮牛腿或伙买伙喂伙使。高庄一带这种互助组织很多，现在我们已采用了这种形式。
