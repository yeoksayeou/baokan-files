　　Thoroughly Eliminate "Keli Kong"
  　Preliminary Inspection of Taiyue Newspapers

    Thoroughly eliminate "Keli Kong." In order to thoroughly eliminate "Keli Kong" and achieve factual news reporting, the Taiyue Xinhua Daily and Xinhua Branch recently inspected newspapers from the past year. Based on comprehensive feedback from various sources, the vast majority of our news and communications are truthful and consistent with objective reality. Therefore, the broad masses completely trust the newspaper and follow the direction pointed out by the newspaper to move forward. However, the inspection also revealed a small number of "Keli Kong" news reports and communications. This type of news communication not only fails to play the due role of encouragement or leadership, but also achieves the opposite result and must be corrected quickly and effectively.

    The currently discovered "Keli Kong" news communications take the following forms: The first type is fabrication, that is, the event did not happen at all, but the author "created" a fact based on their subjective ideals and requirements. For example, the "Drinking Game" published in the newspaper on November 1st of last year, and the "Fushan Spider Web Joint Defense Area Carries Out Land Reform" on January 19th. The "Drinking Game" was originally an ordinary tea-drinking game of captured officers, but we described it as "Drinking Game" when they met in the report. According to a letter from a comrade in Fushan, the "Fushan Spider Web Joint Defense Area Carries Out Land Reform" did not happen at all. This kind of practice also exists in our editing work. For example, when compiling criticism drafts, we must add "It has attracted the attention of the leadership and is being corrected." However, in general, this kind of fabricated news is rare. The second type is exaggerating facts and adding embellishments. This phenomenon is more common than the first type. For example, the "Defend the Land Temple" on September 7th, the "Surprise Attack" on November 9th, and the "Jiyuan 100,000 Farmers Joint Defense" on May 25th. Taking "Defend the Land Temple" as an example, the original fact was that the soldiers were digging fortifications with their bodies bent over with difficulty, but the author exaggerated it as "more than a dozen people put their red chests to the ground, digging the mud with a pickaxe bit by bit." The "Surprise Attack" communication was a "shortening of history," writing about the things that Comrade Zhao Chuan had done over the years as happening in one day. Even though this is true, it is still an exaggeration that does not conform to reality. As for the "Jiyuan 100,000 Farmers Joint Defense," according to comrades in Jiyuan, it was only a joint defense of several villages, with only a few thousand people participating in the joint defense, but the author wrote it as the same 100,000 farmers joint defense. This kind of exaggeration is generally conscious and is the most obvious kind of "Keli Kong" style. The third type is not analyzing and studying the essence of things, but only reporting general false appearances, such as the report on March 7th, "The Transformation of Yao Shuangxi, a Landlord in Changzi." According to Yao Shuangxi's expression of bowing his head to the peasants, it was completely a means, but in order to find a "Zhang Yongtai," we wrote Yao Shuangxi as "automatically taking a broom to sweep the courtyard for military dependents, carrying water," "automatically burning firewood and serving meals..." Furthermore, our reports on land reform in certain districts and villages in southern Shanxi in the previous period only saw the superficial false appearances, calling it a "breakthrough" completion. In essence, it was not the case at all. This kind of false appearance being described as the essence is a "Keli Kong" that does not conform to reality.

    This kind of "Keli Kong" report that does not conform to reality is very harmful. Using it to expose the enemy will not make the enemy feel pain; using it to praise the masses will not make the masses feel excited; using it to conduct criticism will put a "burden" on the comrades. If the higher authorities were to determine the guiding principles and policies based on this kind of report, it would be a big mistake and cause endless harm.

    In the past, when the District Party Committee decided on guiding principles and policies, the materials in the newspaper were one of the bases. For example, determining the anti-reversal movement based on the report of anti-reversal in Yuanqu is one example. However, the report on land reform in southern Shanxi almost caused a mistake. The reports in the previous period were that breakthroughs were being made everywhere, and some places had proposed that the current issue was one of in-depth study. In fact, some areas took detours and developed deviations such as simply dividing the fields. If the Party Committee were to decide on the guiding principles for work in southern Shanxi based solely on the materials in the newspaper, wouldn't that be a big mistake?

    Therefore, there are many reasons for the above phenomenon, mainly the following: First of all, we have not distinguished our newspaper from the newspapers of the bourgeoisie in principle. Our newspaper is to serve the people, to reflect the real voices and demands of the people, the real actions and creations, in order to correctly explain a problem or solve a problem for the people, and to do something for the people. The newspapers of the bourgeoisie are completely the opposite, actually distorting reality to the best of their ability, in order to cover up their own corrupt essence and slander the correct demands and actions of the people. Some of our comrades have insufficient understanding of this point, and have been unintentionally influenced by the newspapers of the bourgeoisie, or think that "internal guidance work should be truthful, and external propaganda can be exaggerated a little," or think that "news should be truthful, and stories can be exaggerated a little," forgetting our position of serving the people and our style of seeking truth from facts.

    Another is the worship of individual heroism, which is manifested in unit terms as departmentalism. Some reporters or correspondents, starting from expressing themselves, do not hesitate to exaggerate the facts. For example, after a comrade talked about the "Zhang Yongtai Road" editorial, he was determined to find a "Zhang Yongtai" at the same time and in the same way, so he made an exaggerated report on the landlord Yao Shuangxi. Some comrades feel that since my name is signed, I need to write a little "completely," so incomplete materials are also written "completely." According to this review, comrades with serious individual heroism have heavier "Keli Kong" habits; on the contrary, some more honest comrades, although their reports do not have amazing achievements, what they write is true, and therefore they are welcomed and supported by the masses.

    The third type starts from fixed ideas. This is mainly manifested in using the framework of policies and laws to forcibly apply to the following materials. For example, when calling for seizing the time to complete land reform, everywhere there was "land reform completed in ten days," and there were "typical examples of land reform completed in seven days." When emphasizing the mass line, everywhere it was "starting from the urgent demands of the masses." When calling for defending the wheat harvest, Jiyuan had "100,000 people in joint defense." In fact, it was not the case at all. We were all "cutting our feet to fit the shoes," "cutting" the living facts below to make them lose their original appearance in order to fit our fixed ideas.

    Finally, a careless and sloppy style is also a reason for creating "Keli Kong." For example, some editors casually wave their pens, causing the content of the original manuscript to completely change. For example, when dealing with the draft of three thousand poor households in Gaoping who had not been allocated land, they casually added "since the re-examination in mid-April," the fact is that it was before the re-examination. Not only did this manuscript lose its practical significance, but it also affected the work mood of some comrades in Gaoping. These lessons are worth our good acceptance.

    The above is only our preliminary review. We hope that comrades engaged in news work in various places will give us their comments so that we can conduct the necessary self-examination in order to clearly recognize the harm of "Keli Kong" and dig out its roots ideologically, in order to thoroughly eliminate "Keli Kong" and better serve the people.

　　彻底消灭“客里空”
  　太岳报纸的初步检查
    太岳新华日报
  　新华分社
    彻底消灭“客里空”。太岳新华日报暨新华分社，为了彻底消灭“客里空”与实现不符合的新闻，我们最近检查了一年来的报纸，综合各方反映，我们的新闻通讯绝大部分是真实的，是符合于客观现实的，所以广大群众完全信赖报纸，跟着报纸所指出的方向前进。但是在检查中，也发现了少数的“客里空”的新闻通讯，这种新闻通讯，不仅不能起应有的鼓励或领导作用，而且得了相反的结果，必须迅速而切实的纠正。
    现在所发现的“客里空”新闻通讯，有以下几种形式：第一种无中生有，即本来就没有这一件事情，而由作者的主观理想与要求，“创造”了一个事实。如去年十一月一日报所刊登的“行酒令”，与一月十九日的“浮山蛛网联防里进行土地改革”即是。“行酒令”原是被俘的军官的平常喝茶时的游戏，我们却在报导他们开会时，描写如何“行酒令”。“浮山蛛网联防里进行土地改革一稿，据浮山同志来信，根本没有这一回事情。这种作法，在我们编辑工作中也存在，如编批评稿时，一定要加上“已引起领导上注意，正改正中”即是。但总的说来，这种无中生有的新闻，是很少的。第二种夸大事实，添枝加叶，这种现象，比上一种较多。如九月七日报“守住土地祠”，十一月九日的“奇袭”，五月二十五日“济源十万农民大联防”。以“守住土地祠”说，原来的事实是挖工事时战士躬着身子困难的挖着工事，但作者却渲染成“十多个人都将红色的胸膛，贴到地上，艰难的一镐一镐的挖着泥土”。“奇袭”的通讯却是“缩短历史”，把赵川同志几年来所作的事情，写成一天内所发生的，这样尽管是真的，也是一种不符现实的夸大。至于“济源十万农民大联防”，据济源同志来谈，仅仅是几个村的联防，参加联防的不过几千人，作者却把它写成同样的十万农民大联防。这种夸大，一般是有意识的，且是最明显的一种“客里空”作风。第三种不分析研究事物的本质，只报导出一般假象，如三月七日报载“长子地主姚双喜的转变”，根据姚双喜表示向农民低头，完全是种手段，而我们为了要找一个“张永泰”，所以将姚双喜写成“自动拿扫帚给军属扫院、担水”，“自动烧火、端饭………。”再如我们对前一时期晋南某些区村土地改革的报导也只是看到表面的假象，叫“突破”完成。实质上完全不是那回事，这种假象描写成为本质，这是不符合现实的“客里空”。
    这种与现实不符合的“客里空”的报导，为害甚大，以这来揭发敌人，敌人不会感到痛，以这来表扬群众，群众不会感到兴奋，以这来进行批评，会给同志们背上“包袱”，上级要根据这种报导来确定方针政策，更会大错，贻害无穷。
    过去区党委在决定方针政策时，报纸上的材料即是根据之一，如根据垣曲反倒算的报导，确定反倒算的运动，即其一例。但对晋南土地改革报导，就几乎铸成错误，前一个时期报导是到处突破了，有些地方已提出现在是深入的问题。事实上有些地区走了弯路，发生了单纯分田等偏向，要是党委仅仅根据报上的材料去决定晋南工作方针，那不是要犯很大错误吗？
    所以造成以上的现象，有许多原因的，主要有以下几种：首先是没将我们的报纸与资产阶级的报纸从原则上区分开来。我们的报纸是为人民服务的，是要反映出人民真实的呼声和要求，真实的行动和创造，以达到正确的为人民解释一个问题或解决一个问题，为人民办点事。资产阶级的报纸则完全相反，实际是歪曲现实为能事，以掩饰自己腐臭的本质，污蔑人民的正确的要求与行动。我们有些同志，对这点认识不够，无意中受了资产阶级报纸的影响，或者认为“对内指导工作要真实，对外宣传夸大一点不要紧”，或者认为“新闻要真实、故事夸大一点不要紧”，而忘记了我们为人民办事的立场与实事求是的作风。
    另一种是个人英雄主义在作祟，表现在单位方面的即是本位主义，有些记者或通讯员，从表现自己出发，不惜夸大事实。如某同志谈到“张永泰道路”社论后，就下决心要在同时同样找一个“张永泰”，所以对地主姚双喜作了夸张的报导。有的同志感到既然署上我的名字，须要写“完整”一点才好，因之不完整的材料，也硬写得“完完整整”。据这次检讨，个人英雄主义厉害的同志，“客里空”习气比较重；相反的有些比较老实的同志，虽然报导没有惊人成绩，但写的东西是真实的，因之得到群众的欢迎与拥护。
    第三种从固定观念出发，这主要表现在拿上政策法令的框子硬套下面的材料，如在号召争取时间完成土改时，到处都是“十天完成土地改革”，有“七天完成土地改革的典型”。在强调走群众路线时，到处都是从群众迫切要求出发。”在号召保卫麦收时，济源就有“十万人联防”。事实上完全不是那回事，都是我们在“削足适履”，为了适合我们固定的观念，将下面活生生的事实都“削”得走了原样。
    最后粗枝大叶等作风，也是造成“客里空”的一个原因。如有些编者同志，随便拿笔一挥，使原稿的内容完全走样，如处理高平三千户赤贫未分到土地一稿，随便添上“自四月中旬复查以来”，事实是复查以前的事，不仅这个稿件失去了它的现实意义，而且影响了高平有些同志的工作情绪，这些教训值得我们很好接受。
    以上仅是我们初步的检讨，希望各地从事新闻工作的同志给以指正，使能进行必要的自我检讨，以便明确的认识“客里空”的害处，并从思想上挖出他的根源，以达到彻底消灭“客里空”，更好的为人民办事。
