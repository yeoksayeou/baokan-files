Learning from the Self-Criticism of the Jin Sui Daily

　　The Jin Sui Daily published an article on June 25th and 26th entitled "Exposure of Untrue News and a 'Khlistakov'" ("Khlistakov" is a character in the famous Soviet play "The Front," a newspaper reporter who exaggerates and lies). In this article, the Jin Sui Daily rigorously exposed the shortcomings in its own work and traced the origins of the errors. In this self-criticism, they also revealed that some of our journalists, like an "Ai Bo," had stood on the side of the landlords against the peasants for selfish purposes. This self-criticism by the Jin Sui Daily is excellent. Recently, like other liberated areas, Jin Sui has been carrying out land reform. The self-criticism of the Jin Sui Daily is a gain in the land reform and will surely push the news work further forward. This kind of self-criticism should be learned not only by journalists in all liberated areas, but also by all work departments, in order to further improve their work. In this sense, the initiative of the Jin Sui Daily is very significant.

　　The self-criticism of the Jin Sui Daily was carried out under the new situation of the domestic war and land reform.

　　We are now in a civil war of unprecedented scale in history. The enemy of the people is the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary group, which is aided by American imperialism. One of the most important guarantees for the Chinese people to defeat this enemy with their own strength is the thorough solution of the land problem. First and foremost, the thorough solution of the land problem in the liberated areas. The Great Revolution of 1925-1927 failed because Chen Duxiu's opportunism dared not lead the peasants to solve the land problem. During the civil war, imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary group launched a severe offensive against the revolutionary forces, but because our Party resolutely supported and led the land revolution, the revolutionary movement was able to persist and develop. During the Anti-Japanese War, China had built a national united front, including Chiang Kai-shek, and our Party's land policy was correctly changed to rent reduction and interest reduction and confiscation of traitorous property. The current situation is different from that of the Anti-Japanese War. Our country still has a broad united front fighting for national independence, democracy, and freedom, but this united front no longer includes Chiang Kai-shek. On the contrary, the Chiang Kai-shek group is now a group of traitors, fascists, and war criminals, and is the public enemy of the people. Under these circumstances, it is absolutely necessary for our Party's land policy to change to a thorough distribution of land, so that landless and land-poor peasants can obtain land, farm tools, livestock, seeds, food, clothing, and housing; at the same time, the livelihood of landlords is also taken care of, so that landlords and peasants alike can receive a share of the land. Resolutely implementing this policy will ensure that the people will be able to defeat Chiang Kai-shek; if Chen Duxiu's opportunist errors are repeated at this time, the revolutionary movement will be in danger of failure.

　　The change from the Anti-Japanese National United Front and rent and interest reduction to the domestic war and equal distribution of land cannot but raise new questions and have a profound impact on all our work, because the new situation requires that all our work be improved as necessary to adapt to this situation, to promote land reform and to win the victory of the war. Anything that hinders land reform and impedes the victory of the war must be eliminated. Every revolutionary must not ignore or deeply resist this task of improvement.

　　When the revolutionary movement advances from the Anti-Japanese War and rent and interest reduction to the current domestic war and equal distribution of land, there is no change in the nature of the revolution, and both still belong to the nature of New Democracy. However, in terms of specific content, there have been changes, and the most important point in this change is the struggle between landlords and peasants. There are many revolutionary intellectuals in our ranks, many of whom come from landlord and rich peasant families. Their position is often more firm when fighting against imperialism and big landlords and big bourgeoisie, but when the revolutionary movement deepens into universal land reform and universal elimination of the feudal system, the intellectuals from landlord and rich peasant families, because they have some connection with the feudal system, will waver in their position if they are reluctant to cut off the feudal tail, and are reluctant to sacrifice personal and family interests for the sake of the overall interests of the revolution. Some of them will degenerate to protect the landlords and oppose the peasants, or degenerate to the position of rich peasants who selfishly and exclusively occupy the fruits of the peasant struggle. This is a phenomenon that inevitably occurs in the development of the democratic revolutionary movement. If this kind of wavering and degeneration is not resolutely opposed, it will hinder the development of the revolutionary movement, and it will not be possible to cure the disease and save people personally. One of the important differences between now and the anti-Japanese stage is that land reform has developed from rent reduction and interest reduction and confiscation of traitorous property to universal and thorough distribution of land and elimination of feudalism. At this time, all revolutionary intellectuals in our ranks who come from landlord and rich peasant families must be vigilant about their position, that is, in the struggle between landlords and peasants, they must firmly stand on the position of serving the peasants, and then they will have a decent style. It should be pointed out that on the issue of anti-imperialism and anti-big landlords and big bourgeoisie, from the anti-Japanese stage to the present stage, from opposing Japan and Wang to opposing the United States and Chiang, our entire team is very firm and unwavering. On the land issue, from the anti-Japanese stage to the present stage, from rent reduction and interest reduction and confiscation of traitorous property to a thorough and universal equal distribution of land and elimination of feudalism, our entire team is still firm, but in individual personnel, individual departments, and even individual regions, there is some wavering, and some individual personnel show degeneration in their position, and an improper style occurs, mainly manifested in protecting landlords, attacking peasants, stealing fruits, and deceiving superiors. This kind of erroneous position and improper style makes the Party show a phenomenon of being divorced from the masses in certain links and certain regions, and these phenomena are very serious in some places. This phenomenon of being divorced from the masses has been alerted to and corrected in many areas, but there are still some areas that have not been corrected, and it will take a lot of effort to correct them. This is a new change that has occurred in our team under the new situation. Our Party is a party that has gone through the rectification movement, and is united under the leadership of our leader Comrade Mao Zedong and the Central Committee, but we should see this new change, and therefore we must not be complacent, but must make great efforts to eliminate certain phenomena of being divorced from the masses, and recognize the phenomena of wavering, degeneration and improper style in our team, so that our team will be more united, improve our work, and strive for the victory of the war and the realization of New Democracy.

　　In order to achieve this goal, open self-criticism is our powerful weapon. This kind of open self-criticism will not reduce the prestige of our Party, on the contrary, it can only improve the prestige of our Party, because only our Party is so serious about the cause of the Chinese national revolution and takes such responsibility. This self-criticism and the commendation of heroic models are two sides of the same thing, and neither is indispensable. The purpose of both is to improve our work in order to achieve thorough land reform and strive for the victory of the patriotic self-defense war.

### 学习晋绥日报的自我批评

　　学习晋绥日报的自我批评
    晋绥日报于六月二十五、六两日发表了“不真实新闻与客里空之揭露”（“客里空”是苏联名剧“前线”中的一个信口开河的新闻记者）一文。晋绥日报在这篇文字中，严格揭露了自己工作中的缺点，寻根究底追寻错误的由来。在这个自我批评的工作中，他们也揭露了我们的新闻工作者中，有象艾柏这样的人，为了自私自利的目的，曾经站在地主方面反对农民。晋绥日报此次的自我批评是很好的。最近一时期，晋绥与其他解放区一样，正在进行土地改革。晋绥日报的自我批评，是土地改革中的一个收获，它必将使新闻工作更加向前推前一步。这种自我批评，不仅各解放区的新闻工作者要学习，而且一切工作部门都应当向它学习，以便更加改进自己的工作。在这个意义上，晋绥日报的这一倡导是非常有意义的。
    晋绥日报的自我批评，是在国内战争与土地改革的新形势下进行的。
    现在我们是处在历史上空前规模的内战之中，人民的敌人是蒋介石反动集团，这个反动集团有美国帝国主义的援助，中国人民要以自己的力量战胜这个敌人，最重要的保证之一，就是土地问题的彻底解决。首先是解放区土地问题的彻底解决。一九二五年至一九二七的大革命，曾经因为陈独秀的机会主义，不敢领导农民解决土地问题，以致遭到失败。内争时期，帝国主义与蒋介石反动集团向革命势力作严重的进攻，但是由于我党坚决赞助和领导了土地革命，所以革命运动仍能坚持和发展。抗日战争时期，我国曾经建成了包括蒋介石在内的民族统一战线，我们党的土地政策改变为减租减息与没收汉奸财产的政策是正确的。现在的情势与抗日时期已经不同，我国仍有广大的、为民族独立、民主自由而奋斗的统一战线，但这个统一战线已不包括蒋介石在内；相反的，蒋介石集团现在是卖国贼、法西斯和战争罪犯的集团，是人民的公敌。在这种情形之下，我党的土地政策改变到彻底平分田地，使无地、少地的农民得到土地、农具、牲畜、种子、粮食、衣服和住所；同时又照顾地主的生活，让地主和农民同样分得一份土地，乃是绝对必要的。坚决执行这个政策，则人民一定能够战胜蒋介石；如果在这时候重复陈独秀的机会主义错误，则革命运动会有失败的危险。
    从抗日民族统一战线与减租减息，变到国内战争与平分田地，这个变化不能不对我们的一切工作提出新的问题和发生具有深刻意义的影响，因为新的形势要求我们的一切工作都有必要的改进，来适应这个形势，来推动土地改革与争取战争的胜利。凡是阻碍土地改革与妨碍争取战争胜利的，必须予以革除。每一个革命者对于这个改进工作的任务，决不能漠视无睹深闭固拒。
    在革命运动由抗日战争与减租减息推进到现在的国内战争与平分田地时，就革命的性质来说是没有变化的，两者都仍旧是属于新民主主义的性质。但是就具体内容来说，则已经有了变化，这个变化中的最重要之点，就是在地主与农民之间展开的斗争。我们的队伍中有许多革命的知识分子，其中很多出身于地主、富农的家庭，在与帝国主义和大地主大资产阶级斗争时，立场常常比较坚定的，但是在革命运动深入到普遍的土地改革、普遍的消灭封建制度时，出身于地主、富农家庭的知识分子因为他们与封建制度有若干联系，如果舍不得割掉封建的尾巴，舍不得为整个革命的利益而牺牲个人的和家庭的利益，就会发生立场上的动摇，其中一部分就会堕落到袒护地主，反对农民的立场上去，或者堕落到自私自利独占农民斗争果实的富农立场上去，这是民主革命运动发展中必然发生的现象。如果不坚决反对这种动摇与堕落，对于革命运动的发展就会发生妨害，对于个人就不能治病救人。现在与抗日阶段的重要的不同点之一，就是土地改革由减租减息与没收汉奸财产发展成为普遍的平分田地、消灭封建。在这个时候，我们队伍中一切由地主、富农家庭出身的革命知识分子，必须警惕到自己的立场，即是在地主与农民之间的斗争中，要坚决站在为农民服务的立场上，然后才会有正派的作风。应该指出，在反帝国主义、反大地主大资产阶级的问题上，从抗日阶段到现在阶段，从反对日汪转到反对美蒋，我们的整个队伍是十分坚定而毫不动摇的。在土地问题上，从抗日阶段到现在阶段，从减租减息没收汉奸财产深入到普遍的彻底的平分田地与消灭封建，我们的整个队伍仍然是坚定的，但在个别人员、个别部门、甚至个别地区，则表现出某种动摇，有些个别人员则表现出立场上的堕落，而不正派的作风就发生出来，主要的表现于袒护地主、打击农民、窃取果实、欺骗上级。这种错误的立场与不正派的作风，使得党在某些环节、某些地区发生脱离群众的现象，这些现象在若干地方表现得很严重。这种脱离群众的现象，在不少地区已被警觉到和纠正过来，但是还有些地区没有纠正过来，还要用很大的努力才能纠正，这是在新的形势下我们队伍之中所发生的新的变化。我们的党是经过了整风运动的党，是团结一致在我们的领袖毛泽东同志和中央委员会的领导之下的，但是我们应该看到这个新的变化，因而决不能自满，要以很大的努力来肃清若干脱离群众的现象，认清我们队伍中动摇堕落和作风不正派的现象，使我们的队伍更加团结一致，改进工作，争取战争的胜利和新民主主义的实现。
    为了达到这个目的，公开的自我批评是我们有力的武器，这种公开的自我批评不但不会降低我们党的威信，相反的它只能提高我们党的威信，因为只有我们的党对于中国民族革命的事业才是这样郑重其事、这样负起责任，这种自我批评与对于英雄模范的表扬是一件事情的两方面，二者不可缺一，其目的都是为了改进工作，以求实现彻底的土地改革与争取爱国自卫战争的胜利。
