    【Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 17th】Berlin Dispatch: Bankanov, Director of the Agricultural Department of the Soviet Military Administration in the Soviet Occupation Zone of Germany, recently made a statement at a press conference here, describing the achievements of land reform in the Soviet Occupation Zone: Land reform is one of the important methods for the democratization of Germany and the deprivation of the privileges of the Junker families. As a result of the land reform, all poor and landless peasants have obtained land. The township special land committees, elected by the congresses of hired peasants, landless and poor peasants, displaced persons, and small tenant farmers, are the executive organs of the land reform. As of July 1 this year, the Land Reform Fund Committee had received land from 12,355 landlords, with a total area of 3,041,500 hectares. Approximately 496,795 poor and hired peasants, totaling about 2 million people, obtained 2,051,000 hectares of land as their private property. The remaining land was allocated to experimental farms, agricultural schools, and farmers' associations. In the land reform, the peasants also obtained 110,000 houses and warehouses, 6,000 tractors, and 270,000 agricultural machines. The peasants also obtained long-term loans for the construction of houses, the purchase of cattle and farm implements, totaling 316.7 million marks. A new form of agricultural organization, the Peasants' Mutual Aid Committee, has emerged during the land reform, and currently has 480,000 members. The committee has used the property it obtained during the land reform to establish machinery lending stations and networks. Bankanov emphatically stated that as a result of the land reform, the urban residents of the Soviet Occupation Zone have been supplied with enough grain to last until this year's harvest. This year's agricultural work in the Soviet Occupation Zone has been very successful, and the grain situation in the Soviet Occupation Zone will not cause any concern. The Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference unanimously decided to implement land reform in all occupation zones of Germany in 1947. The above facts prove that the Soviet Occupation Zone has implemented this decision and has already completed it.

    德境苏占领区完成土地改革
    【新华社陕北十七日电】柏林讯：德境苏联占领区军政府农业处处长班卡诺夫，顷于此间记者招待会上发表谈话，叙述苏联占领区的土地改革成绩称：土改是德国民主化与剥夺容克世家特权的重要方法之一，由于土改结果，一切贫苦与无地农民均已获得土地。由雇农、无地及贫苦农民、移难民及小佃农大会所选出的乡特别土地委员会，为土改之执行机关。至今年七月一日为止，土改基金委员会共接收一二三五五家地主的土地，总面积达三、○四一、五○○公顷，四十九万六千七百九十五家贫雇农约二百万人，获得了二百零五万一千公顷的土地，作为其私产。剩余土地则拨交实验农场、农业学校及农会等。农民在土改中并获得房屋及仓库十一万所，拖拉机六千架，农业机器二十七万架。农民并获得长期贷款，作为建造房屋、购买耕牛及农具之用，总数达三亿一千六百七十万马克。土改中产生了新的农业组织形式——农民互助委员会，目前拥有会员四十八万人。该委会利用其在土改中所得到的财产，建立了出借机器站网等。班氏力称：土改结果，供应了苏占区城市居民足可维持到今年收获时的粮食。今年苏占区的农业工作非常成功，苏占区目前粮食情况不会引起任何忧虑。莫斯科外长会议曾一致决议于四七年在德国各占领区实行土改，上述事实证明苏占区已实行了这一决定，并且业已完成。
