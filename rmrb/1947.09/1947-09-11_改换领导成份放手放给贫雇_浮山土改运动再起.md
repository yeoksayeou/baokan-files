　　Changing Leadership Composition, Boldly Empowering Poor and Hired Peasants
  　Fushan Land Reform Movement Rekindled
    [This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch of the 8th] After clarifying ideology and class status, and truly boldly empowering the masses, Fushan recovered area achieved breakthroughs in thirty-two out of thirty-four administrative villages within ten days in its land reform. The area had undergone struggle before August, but due to the leadership's timidity and the absolute dominance of middle peasants in the village-level leadership, with even landlords infiltrating and seizing leadership positions, the movement was impacted. This time, starting from August 11th, the focus was first on conducting an ideological and class rectification movement among village cadres to transform the leadership composition. For example, in Chennanhe Administrative Village's twenty cadres, seven were landlords and feudal rich peasants, ten of the remaining thirteen cadres were middle peasants, and only three were poor peasants. Similar situations existed in villages such as Beiguan and Xizuo. Consequently, the targets of struggle were cleansed, the number of middle peasants was reduced, and a large number of poor and hired peasants participated in the leadership. Poor and hired peasant groups were organized to cultivate them as masters, and middle peasants were united to fight together. In Zhongcun, a landlord beat to death the activist Wei Zijian, prompting all the peasants to retaliate. In Wei Village, landlord Qin Tinggui organized the masses to plot against activists, but the conspiracy was exposed by the impoverished masses who traced the roots, and he was immediately detained for struggle. Secondly, the leadership boldly revised policies and decrees based on the demands of the masses. When the new district's land reform was initially deployed before the wheat harvest, the masses were not allowed to dig out hidden assets, which restricted the mass movement. The masses reflected, "There's no profit and no vent for anger," and "Only taking the land makes the landlords feel relieved." Some landlords, seeing that the movement was not fierce, organized counterattacks. This time, based on the peasants' demands, "Take whatever is needed, and take whatever is lacking." The movement was like a flood breaking a dam, advancing straight forward. The masses shouted, "Refreshing! Refreshing!" Cadres adopted the method of "sue where there is suffering, struggle where it is ripe" in their leadership approach. Therefore, in the past month, the fruits of struggle have greatly exceeded those before the wheat harvest. Ren Zhang village alone struggled out 2,500 shi of grain, which is nine times more than before the wheat harvest.

　　改换领导成份放手放给贫雇
  　浮山土改运动再起
    【本报太岳八日电】浮山收复区土地改革经过清思想清阶级，真正大胆放手，十天内三十四个行政村就突出三十二村。该地在八月前已进行过斗争，但因领导上小手小脚，以及村级领导中农占了绝对的领导地位，甚至有地主等混入掌握了领导权，致使运动受到影响。此次从八月十一日开始，首先在村干部中进行了清思想清阶级运动，改造了领导成份。如陈南河行政村二十个干部中，即有七个地主与封建富农，其余十三个干部中有十个中农，贫农只有三人。北关、西佐等村均有类似情况。于是清洗了斗争对象，减少了中农，由大批贫雇农参加了领导，并组织了贫雇小组，培养贫雇当主人，团结中农一块斗争。中村地主打死了积极分子魏子俭，全体农民便进行反报复。卫村地主秦廷贵组织群众，谋害积极分子，被贫苦群众追根，揭破阴谋立即扣押斗争。其次，领导上根据群众要求，大胆修正了政策法令。麦前开始布置新区土改时，不准群众刨内产，使群众运动受到了限制。群众反映：“没油水，又出不了气”，“光拿土地，反给地主轻快了”。而地主则说：“今年斗争比去年好了。”有些地主看到运动不猛，便组织反攻。此次根据农民要求：“要甚拿甚，短甚拿甚”。运动便如洪水决堤，一往直前。群众大叫：“痛快！痛快！”干部在领导方式上实行那里有苦那里诉，那里成熟那里斗的办法。因此一月来，斗争果实大大超过麦前，仅仁彰一村即斗出二千五百石粮，较麦前多九倍。
