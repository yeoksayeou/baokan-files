　　Important Announcement from the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region Government
　　Recently, some individuals have been impersonating this government and forging official passes with the government's seal in × area, engaging in disruptive activities, clearly intending to undermine the government's authority. In addition to legal action, henceforth, regardless of who it is or what documents they carry, if they exhibit misconduct or suspicious behavior, they should be immediately arrested and interrogated. We hope that all departments, military and government agencies, and militia posts will pay close attention to this matter!

　　晋冀鲁豫边区政府重要启事
    近有假冒本府，伪造本府长戳路条之分子，在×地胡作非为，显系故意破坏政府威信。除法办外，今后不论何人，带有何种证件，如有不良行为，或行迹可疑者，即应逮捕审讯。尚希各部军政机关民兵岗哨严密注意为荷！
