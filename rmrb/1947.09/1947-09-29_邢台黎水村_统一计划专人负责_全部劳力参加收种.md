    Xingtai Lishui Village
    Unified Plan, Dedicated Personnel
    All Labor Force Participating in Harvesting and Planting
    [Report from this newspaper in Xingtai] Comrade Li Qingliang, a labor hero from Lishui Village, proposed the slogan: "Grain doesn't count until it's safely home," organized the entire village's labor force, and led the early completion of the autumn harvest, planting the timely wheat. The entire village's autumn crops (mainly millet and corn) totaled 247 mu, with 123 men, women, and semi-able-bodied laborers. It was estimated to take four days. According to Wang Junsheng's contracting method, the amount of labor required for each different crop was first estimated as fixed points. For example, for millet fields within two li, each mu harvested, including cutting and transporting back, was equivalent to two work points; for fields two to three li away, each mu harvested, including cutting and transporting back, was equivalent to two and a half work points. Laborers were also given mutual work points, and each laborer was assigned fixed points, written on an armband and worn on the arm. After completing a task, points were distributed equally based on the laborer's points. Those who did more work collectively received bonus points, and those who did less had points deducted. In terms of work, labor was specifically divided according to skill and experience. Every evening, based on the day's harvesting situation, a plan was made for whose land to plow first and whose land to plow later. Two people were specifically responsible for collecting plows and tools, and for exchanging ration tickets for the plowing leaders, who would then distribute them further. Harvesting crops was also the responsibility of dedicated personnel, with unified planning and discussion. Regardless of whose crops they were, as long as they were ripe, they would be harvested continuously. Strong laborers were entirely responsible for transporting manure to the fields, and someone was also specifically responsible for this, carrying a load of manure to the fields and a load of crops back. Those ＠ stubble were specifically responsible for ＠ stubble. This created a great impetus. Li Qingwen's group, consisting of 16 elderly people, women, children, and other semi-able-bodied laborers, harvested 11 mu of millet in one day, and plucked the ears of millet from nine mu. Li Ruyong's group ＠ stubble fields more than three li from the village, each person carrying a load of manure to the fields. Three people ＠ the four mu of stubble fields in one day, breaking the soil clods very finely. Under such organization and leadership, 175 mu were harvested in two days, the millet was plucked, and the millet stubble was also ＠. In the two days, more than 1,000 loads of manure were transported to the fields, enough for 20 mu of land. Only 52 mu of autumn crops planted later had not been harvested (as they were not yet ripe). The autumn harvest was completed two days ahead of schedule, saving 80 workdays. After the harvest was completed, the focus immediately shifted to plowing and transporting manure, with the slogan "Plow one mu, transport manure for one mu." The plan was to plow 300 mu of land before the tenth day of the eighth lunar month, and people were organized to pull plows. On the sixth day of the eighth lunar month, Li Qingwen's group started early in the morning, with four people plowing 1.6 mu of land. Women and children turned to gathering wild vegetables. Under the leadership of women's salvation instructor Liu Fuge, 32 women and 14 children gathered 3,200 jin of vegetables in two days.

    【本报邢台讯】黎水村劳动英雄李庆亮同志提出：“庄稼不到家不算粮”的口号，组织全村劳力领导秋收提前完成，种上应时麦子。全村秋庄稼（主要是谷子、玉茭）二百四十七亩，男女整半劳力一百二十三人，计算须要四天时间，根据王俊生包工办法，先按各种不同的庄稼，用工多少估成死分，如谷子在二里以内的地，每收一亩连割带往回运，折工两个，二里至三里的地，每收一亩，连割带运折工两个半。劳力也互相折分，把每个劳力都定成死分，用臂章形式写上去，挂在胳膊上，每做完一件活，按劳力分数，平均分分，做的活多共同加分，活少减分。做活上根据技术与经验劳力专门分工，每晚根据白日收割情况，计划明天先耕谁的地，后耕谁的地，有两个人专管收拾犁杖家具，并换晌票，给耕地的领导人，他再往下分。收庄稼也是有专人负责，统一计划讨论，不管谁的，只要熟了，便连着割过去。往地运粪的全是强劳力，光管运粪，也有人专门负责，往地担一遭粪，往回担一遭庄稼，＠茬的专管＠茬，这样突击性很大。李庆文组老头妇女儿童等半劳力十六人，一天割谷子十一亩，九亩都把谷穗掐了。李如永组＠茬子，地离村三里多，往地走每人还捎一担粪，四亩茬地，三个人一天＠完，土块打的很烂。这样组织领导下，两天收割了一百七十五亩，谷子掐了，谷茬也＠，两天中往地捎粪一千余担，可上二十亩地，秋庄稼只有后来种的五十二亩未收（还不熟），秋收提前完成两天，省工八十个。收毕马上转向耕、运粪，口号是“耕一亩，运一亩”，计划阴历八月初十前要耕地三百亩，并组织人拉犁。李庆文组初六日，一早起四个人即耕地一亩六分。妇女儿童转向打野菜，在妇救指导员刘福娥领导下，三十二个妇女，十四个儿童两天打菜三千二百斤。
