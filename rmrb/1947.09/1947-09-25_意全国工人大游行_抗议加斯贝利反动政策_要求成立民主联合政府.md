Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, September 23rd: A comprehensive report from Rome states: The 20th was the Italian laboring people's "National Day of Great Protest" against the reactionary Gasperi government. Under the call of the Communist Party, Socialist Party, and the General Confederation of Labor, from 4:00 PM onwards, the Italian working class and the broad masses of working people, holding placards with slogans against rising prices and demanding the resignation of the Gasperi cabinet, flooded the streets, making all central cities across the country, such as Rome, Naples, Turin, Milan, Venice, Genoa, and Florence, lively and impassioned. The demonstrators were orderly, with red flags and the Italian Republic's national flag flying side-by-side in the wind before and in the middle of their long lines. In industrial cities such as Milan, Genoa, and Florence, the number of participants in the demonstrations reached over 100,000 in each city. At mass rallies across the country, members of the Communist Party, Socialist Party, Action Party, Republican Party, and Democratic Labor Party delivered speeches, condemning the reactionary policies of the Gasperi cabinet, and unanimously demanding the establishment of a democratic coalition government. It is reported that the launch of this National Day of Great Protest was announced by an Italian Communist Party spokesperson on the 18th. Prior to this, Italian reactionaries and American interventionists had spread rumors and intimidation on a large scale, attempting to undermine its progress. Northern farm owners and landlords, who had persistently refused the workers' demands, panicked upon learning of the decision for this National Day of Great Protest, hurriedly agreeing to the wage increase demands of over one million agricultural workers who had been on strike for twelve days, attempting to prevent the launch of this large-scale demonstration. However, these attempts all failed miserably, and the workers proceeded with the great protest parade as decided.
