　　Blind Ox Goes to the Countryside to Ask About Suffering

    Last month, this newspaper reprinted "Wang Yuanshou Visits Blind Ox." Now, Blind Ox is also going to the countryside to ask about suffering. This is another concrete result of Wang Yuanshou's work method. --Editor

　　Comrade Wang Yuanshou often talked with Blind Ox and studied the matter of turning over. Blind Ox said, "Our strength alone is small. Let me go down to the countryside to ask about suffering! I am a local villager and know who is suffering and who is not." Then he mobilized the three Niu Mao little brothers to complain about the suffering of renting land, Gou Buli complained about the suffering of family oppression, and introduced them to the Farmers' Association.

    Tenant farmer Wang Laxiao is a cow with a calf; people look down on him, and he hasn't had a good day for most of his life. More than a dozen comrades from the work team visited him to ask about his suffering. Laxiao said, "I have never participated in a meeting, and people don't bother me, I haven't provoked anyone, and no one has provoked me." When his rented land was mentioned, he said, "The rent has already been paid, what's the point of talking about it?!" The comrades who visited him were all rebuffed. Some poor peasant activists said he was a stubborn old slicker. Blind Ox said, "I'll go mobilize him, he and I are compatible, I know he has a lot of suffering." Blind Ox talked with him for an afternoon. Blind Ox said, "Speaking of suffering, you suffer more than I do." Wang Laxiao said, "I'm too shy to offer opinions." "Is complaining about suffering more shameful than wearing revealing pants? How have you been so poor without food every year, and suffering from heatstroke every year, is it because you are not taking good care of yourself?!" Laxiao was moved and poured out his suffering, digging out the root of his poverty. Laxiao's wife also began to complain: "The quilt is rough, the kiln is too low to stand up straight, we don't eat rice all year round, at best we eat corn mixed with chaff, our second child is eighteen years old, only three feet tall, with a head the size of a fist. If he were born in a rich man's family, how could he grow so big?" Speaking of the suffering, Laxiao, his wife, and children all cried. The whole family joined the Farmers' Association through Blind Ox's introduction, never missing a meeting. Blind Ox happily said, "My name has been published in the Border Region newspaper. I want to learn from Old Wang and do work. The Communist Party uses good people as cadres. If we become village cadres, can we still side with the rich?!" (Xinhua News Agency Jin-Cha-Ji News)

　　瞎牛下乡访苦
    上月份，本报曾转载“王元寿访瞎牛”，现在瞎牛也下乡访苦了，这是王元寿的工作方式的又一具体收获。——编者
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    王元寿同志，经常和瞎牛道啦，研究翻心的事，瞎牛说：“光咱们力量小，我也给咱下去访苦吧！我是本村人，知道谁有苦谁没苦。”接着他发动牛毛小弟兄三人，诉租地苦，狗不理诉家长压迫苦，并介绍他们入了农会。
    佃农王拉小是带犊儿；人们都看不起他，多半辈子没有好过一天。工作组十几个同志访过苦，拉小说：“我永远没参加过会，人们也不追究我，我也没有惹过人，人也没有惹过我。”提到他的租佃地，他说：“租子已经出啦，那还说个甚！？”访苦的同志都碰了钉子，有的贫农积极分子说他是顽固老油腻，瞎牛说：“我去发动他，他和我对脾气，我知道，他的苦多哩。”瞎牛和他谈了一下午，瞎牛说：“说到苦事，你比我还受罪。”王拉小说：“我提意见害羞的慌。”“诉苦还比穿露肉裤子羞吗？年年没吃的怎么穷的，年年害汗病，是不是抚养的不好？！”拉小动了心，诉出了苦事，挖出了穷根。拉小的女人也诉起苦来：“被子是圪渣，窑子直不起腰，齐年不吃米，顶好吃玉茭搀点糠，二孩子十八岁了，只有三尺来高，脑袋拳头来大，要是生在财主家，怎长那么大呀？”说到苦处，拉小和老婆孩子都哭了。全家经瞎牛介绍参加了农会，会会不误，瞎牛高兴的说：“我在边区报上登出名字来了，也要学习老王作工作，共产党用上好人顶干部，咱顶了村干部，还能向了有钱的呀！”（新华社晋察冀讯）
