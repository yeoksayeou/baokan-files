The Liu-Deng southward counter-offensive army is vigorously assisting the masses in the Dabie Mountains with the autumn harvest. Wherever the People's Liberation Army arrives, it organizes harvest-assistance teams to help the local farmers harvest rice. Everywhere we went, the mountain slopes and rice paddies were filled with songs and laughter of cooperation between the army and the people. Farmers near Xulou in Jingfu County told stories of how General Wang Zhen's troops helped them harvest rice in the past while the People's Liberation Army was helping them harvest rice. A certain regiment of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army went to the fields in its entirety on the third day after completing its combat mission, and harvested more than ten dan (one dan is equivalent to 2.5 mu) of rice in one day. The Second Company of a certain unit marched to its station in the morning and went to the fields to harvest rice in the afternoon. In the midst of intense wartime work, a certain unit's direct subordinate team organized more than 300 people in one day to help the masses harvest and carry 50 dou of rice, and pick cotton on more than 20 mu. In areas passed through by Chiang Kai-shek's bandits in Guangshan and Shangcheng, many men were captured by Chiang Kai-shek's bandits. The People's Liberation Army is doing everything possible to help the families of the victims with the harvest. Wang Deqing, a 50-year-old farmer from Tangdawan, Guangshan County, was captured by retreating Chiang Kai-shek bandits while harvesting rice. After the People's Liberation Army stationed in the village, they helped Wang Deqing's family harvest all the rice and sesame to their home. After Wang Deqing returned, he saw that all the rice had been harvested and brought home. He found the People's Liberation Army with a smile on his face and said gratefully: "Our troops are just like the old Fourth Army (referring to the Red Fourth Army), thinking of the people in every way. With you here, the people have won the world!"

    中原反攻大军帮助农民收稻
    【新华社中原前线二十六日电】刘邓南下反攻大军，大力帮助大别山区群众秋收。解放军每到一地，即组织助收组，协助驻地农民割稻。所到之处，山坡稻田里洋溢着一片军民合作的歌声与欢笑声。经扶县浒楼附近农民，在人民解放军帮助他们割稻时，即讲说过去王震将军部队帮助他们收稻的故事。解放军某部某团，在完成战斗任务后的第三天，即全体下田，一天内共割稻十余石（一石相当于二亩半）。某部二连，上午行军到达驻地后，下午即下田割稻。某部直属队在紧张的战时工作中，一日内共组织三百余人，帮助群众割稻担稻五十斗，摘棉二十余亩。光山、商城蒋匪所过地区，很多男人被蒋匪捉走，人民解放军即全力帮助被难家属收割。光山县唐大湾五十岁的农民王德清，在割稻子时被溃退的蒋匪抓走，解放军驻扎该村后，即帮助王德清的家属把全部稻子和芝麻收割到家里；王德清回来后，看见稻米都已收割到家，满脸笑容的连忙找到解放军，感激地说：“咱们的队伍和老四军（指红四军）一样，处处为着老百姓；你们来了，老百姓就得了天下了。”
