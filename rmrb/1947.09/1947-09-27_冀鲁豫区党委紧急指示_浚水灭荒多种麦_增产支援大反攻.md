(This article was transmitted by this newspaper from Hebei-Shandong-Henan on the 25th.) To assist the masses in making a concentrated effort in seasonal production and to support the great counteroffensive, the Regional Committee has issued an emergency directive calling on all localities to dredge accumulated water and plant wheat on a large scale. This year, there has been very heavy rainfall, and crops in various localities have been extensively flooded. To this day, large areas of low-lying land remain waterlogged. For example, in Zhaocun Slope, Puyang, there are still two to three thousand hectares of accumulated water. There are also large areas of accumulated water in Yanggu, Liaocheng and surrounding areas. Not only are the autumn crops lying submerged in water, with no hope of harvest, but even the sowing of wheat this autumn has become problematic. At present, dredging accumulated water and striving to plant wheat is the urgent demand of the masses. At the same time, increasing wheat planting and production is of great significance for supporting the war of self-defense. Therefore, the Regional Committee calls on Party committees at all levels to quickly carry out this work. The call also points out that in the dredging process, small conflicts of interest may arise between special districts, counties, and districts. Comrades in all localities must take a comprehensive view, mobilize and explain to the masses, and propose that the land dug from the river can be adjusted through land reform. They must not focus on one thing and lose sight of the other.

[Another News Item] In order to strengthen seasonal production for this year's autumn harvest and wheat planting, the Production Committee of the Regional Committee has notified all rear-area organs to help with the autumn harvest, wheat planting, and the elimination of wasteland. In addition to instructing local committees to vigorously and intensively carry out this work, the Regional Committee has also decided that all Hebei organs, schools, sub-districts, etc., will participate in this intensive work. A Seasonal Production Committee will be organized, with Comrade Liu Yanchun as the chairman, to implement overall leadership. Each unit can organize a Seasonal Production Sub-Committee to specifically plan, organize, and carry out the work. The general requirement for this assistance to the masses in the autumn harvest and wheat planting is to ensure that complex personnel in all organs participate without hindering departmental work, and can lead the masses in the villages where they are stationed, and then gradually extend to neighboring villages, creating an autumn harvest and wheat planting movement to eliminate the wasteland and vacant land near the villages where each unit is stationed. If there is accumulated water in the residential areas of each unit, they should immediately discuss with the local government and the masses to release the water, so that the masses can save themselves and not delay wheat planting. Assistance in the autumn harvest can then be carried out so that crops are not left to rot in the fields. When the wheat planting season arrives, a large-scale intensive wheat planting effort should be launched, mobilizing all manpower, material resources, and animal power, and combining with the masses to carry it out together. Responsible comrades of all organs must personally take action to perform meritorious service for the people. From the current situation, link to the importance of this task, deeply mobilize to clear thinking, and always summarize experience to create a high degree of enthusiasm for seasonal production labor.

    冀鲁豫区党委紧急指示
    浚水灭荒多种麦
    增产支援大反攻
    【本报冀鲁豫廿五日电】为协助群众突击季节生产，支持大反攻，区党委发出紧急指示，要各地疏浚积水，大量种麦。今年雨水很大，各地庄稼被淹很多，至今尚有不少低地存有大片积水。如濮阳赵村坡，尚有两三千顷面积的积水。阳谷、聊城一带亦有大片积水，不但秋禾倒卧水中，收成无望，即今秋种麦亦成问题，目前疏浚积水争取种麦，是群众的迫切要求。同时增加种麦和生产，对支持自卫战争，是有很大意义的。因此，区党委号召各级党委，赶快进行这一工作，号召中并指出疏浚过程中，专区、县、区之间，可能发生小的利害矛盾，要各地同志能以全面着眼，向群众动员解释，提出浚河挖的地可从土地改革中去调剂，不得顾此失彼。
    【又讯】为加强今年秋收种麦的季节生产，区党委生产委员会通知后方各机关，帮助秋收种麦消灭荒地。区党委除指示各地委大力突击进行这一工作，并决定河北各机关、学校、分区等，一律参加这一突击工作；并组织季节生产委员会，由刘晏春同志为主任委员，实行总的领导，各单位可组织季节生产分委会，具体计划组织进行。对此次帮助群众秋收种麦的总要求，是保证各机关复杂人员在不妨碍部门工作下一定参加，并能带领起各驻村的群众，然后逐渐推及邻村，造成秋收种麦运动，消灭各单位驻村附近村庄的荒地空白地。如目前各单位住地有积水的，即与当地政府和群众商量，马上放水，达到群众自救不误种麦，帮助秋收即可进行，不使庄稼烂到地里。如种麦期到，即大量突击种麦，动员全部人力物力畜力，与群众结合一齐进行。各机关负责同志，务必亲自动手，为人民立功，从目前形势联系到这一任务的重要性，深入动员打通思想，要随时总结经验，造成季节生产劳动的高度热情。
