    Embarking on a Glorious Post
    Border Government Bids Farewell to Southern Expedition Cadres

    [This Newspaper's Report] Before the Liu-Deng army launched its counter-offensive, border government cadres vied to follow the army southward, and the first batch of ×× people were approved. When the leadership proposed that cadres go south to areas north of the Yangtze River to mobilize the masses, cadres generally expressed their willingness to go south. Although the leadership once again explained: "The leadership will nominate people to go. Those who are nominated go, and those who are not nominated should work with peace of mind," cadres still submitted written or oral requests, all considering going south to be an unparalleled honor. Before their departure, all comrades of the border government organs had a meal together to bid farewell to the southern expedition cadres, and all the leaders personally accompanied them and offered toasts. A farewell meeting was also held in the evening. Comrade × said: "I have worked in the border area for more than ten years, always under the personal leadership of Chairmen Yang and Rong, and I am very close to my comrades. Once we part, I will feel reluctant. Seeing the vastness of the future, we are very happy." Comrade ×'s wife traveled thousands of miles from the south to reunite with him after ten years of separation. Although she felt a little reluctant this time, she gave up her personal happiness for the sake of the revolution. Vice Chairman Rong encouraged everyone to bring the border area's experience in mobilizing the masses to the south. Vice Chairman Rong also represented all comrades in guaranteeing the completion of land reform and production in the rear to support their glorious mission. Director Yuan said: "We bid you farewell as you go first!"

    [This Newspaper's Report] Before General Li Xiannian of the Fifth Division of the Central Plains returned to the Central Plains, the border government and directly subordinate organs launched a comfort bag sewing campaign. In a few days, more than four hundred bags were sewn, with the words "A Memento from Comrades in the Central Plains!" "Returning to the Central Plains, Don't Forget Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu" written on the bag surfaces. In addition to letters and daily necessities, the bags also contained local products from the Taihang Mountains. Chairmen Yang and Rong of the border government presented the entire Fifth Division with a large brocade banner inscribed with: "Liberate the Central Plains." After Liu, Deng, Xu, and Li crossed the river, they held a banquet to bid farewell to Chairman Tu of the Central Plains Consultative Council and the councilors. Elder Tu and others expressed their gratitude for the care and attention of the border government and the border area compatriots. (Xiushan)

    走上光荣的岗位
    边府欢送南征干部
    【本报讯】刘邓大军反攻出发之前，边府干部争先随军南下，第一次被批准××名。当领导上提出干部南下去长江以北发动群众号召时，干部中普遍愿意南下。虽领导上又再一次说明：“点将点名，点着谁谁去，点不着的安心工作。”但仍纷纷提出书面或口头要求，咸以南下为无尚光荣。出发前边府机关全体同志会餐为南下干部饯行，各首长均亲陪酌酒。夜晚并举行欢送大会。×同志说：“我在边区工作十来年，始终在杨、戎主席亲自领导下，与同志们又都亲热，一旦分手，感情留恋，看到前途之远大，我们又很愉快。”×同志的爱人自南方经千里跋涉，与其十年分别后重聚，此次南下虽情绪稍觉依依，然为了革命，放弃个人幸福。戎副主席勉励大家把边区发动群众经验带过去。戎副主席并代表全体同志，保证完成后方土改生产，支援你们光荣任务。袁厅长说：“我们欢送你们先去！”
    【本报讯】中原五师李先念将军打回中原前，边府及直属机关发起缝做慰问袋运动，不数日共缝四百余个，袋面写有“中原同志留念！”“回到中原不忘晋冀鲁豫”等等字样，袋内除装有书信日用品之外，并有太行山土产。边府杨戎主席赠五师全体同志大幅锦旗一面，上书：“获鹿中原。”刘邓徐李过河后，并设宴与中原参议会涂议长各参议员饯行，涂老等对边府及边区同胞关心照顾颇表感激。（秀山）
