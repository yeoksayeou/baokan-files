    [This report from Taiyue, 24th] 40,000 militiamen in northern Yue, responding to Commander Wu's call, have bravely thrown themselves into the great counter-offensive. The first batch, three field companies from Qinyuan, Anze, and Gu, led by Wu Committee Director Zheng Shiwei and Comrade Li Shu, set off on the 9th to join the counter-offensive front lines. Mass rallies were held in various villages to see them off. At the farewell rallies, the militiamen announced their counter-offensive merit-making plan: not to take a single needle or thread from the masses, not to worry about anything at home, resolutely eliminate the enemy, help the peasants in the new areas to stand up, and guarantee not to return home until the mission is completed. On the spot, the masses also made guarantees to the militiamen: to sow wheat for the militiamen first, harvest the crops early, solve all the difficulties in their homes, actively support the great counter-offensive, and thoroughly eliminate the traitor Chiang Kai-shek! Amidst resounding slogans, the militia companies marched heroically towards the counter-offensive front lines.
    [This report from Taiyue, 24th] The Yicheng militiamen went on an expedition to Yinghe, guarding the Yellow River crossing on one hand and helping the local masses to stand up on the other. After arriving in Yinghe on July 6th, they voluntarily requested to participate in the work of mobilizing the masses to the local work team, wanting to use their own experience of standing up to help the masses in the new areas. First, they rehearsed several scenes of dramas introducing their own emancipation, in order to evoke painful memories of hatred from the local masses. On July 21st, when performing "Liu Changfu Borrows Grain" in Xili Village, more than a thousand viewers were moved to tears, shouting "The poor should unite and overthrow the landlords!" When the play reached the point where the masses were struggling against the landlord, people offstage also shouted: "Beat them hard! Beat them hard!" The next day, the team members took advantage of the heat and went deep into the homes of the masses to promote the land policy and introduce their own experiences of emancipation and the happy life they had obtained. This immediately aroused the masses in the village, who spontaneously arrested and struggled against eight people, including the target of struggle, Dang Laizi, etc. A large meeting was held to struggle against them. Everyone told their grievances and demanded that the militiamen stab Dang Laizi to death. They patiently explained to the masses that they had to speak of their own sufferings and avenge their own hatred, which raised the masses' will to struggle, and Dang Laizi was executed by the masses. From then on, Xili Village broke through the struggle, influencing the surrounding villages, and the masses also launched struggles, asking the militiamen to go and help them to stand up. Another unit, while guarding Beizhao Village in the Third District, used every means to unite and educate the Yellow River boatmen, and helped the militiamen and the masses to arrest and struggle against thirteen targets.

    岳北四万民兵积极参加反攻
    【本报太岳二十四日电】岳北四万民兵响应武总号召，英勇投入大反攻。现第一批沁源、安泽谷三个野战连，在武委会主任郑士威与李述同志率领下，已于九日出发，投奔反攻前线。各村群众集会欢送，在欢送会上，民兵宣布了反攻立功计划，不拿群众一针一线，不挂念家中一切，坚决消灭敌人，帮助新区农民翻身，保证不完成任务不回家。当场群众亦向民兵提出保证：要先给民兵种上麦子，庄稼早收，解决其家中一切困难，积极支援大反攻，彻底消灭卖国贼蒋介石！在响亮的口号声中，民兵连威武的走向反攻前线。
    【本报太岳二十四日电】翼城民兵远征荥河，一面把守黄河渡口，一面帮助当地群众翻身。七月六日，他们到荥河后，自动向当地工作队要求参加发动群众工作，要以自己的翻身经验来帮助新区群众翻身。首先排演了几幕介绍自己翻身的戏剧，以便引起当地群众痛苦仇恨的回忆。七月二十一日，在西里村出演“刘长富借粮”时，观众千余人无不掉泪，高喊“穷人团结起来，打倒老财！”演至群众斗争地主时，台下也都喊着：“狠打！狠打！”第二天，队员们便趁热打铁，深入群众家宣传土地政策，及介绍自己翻身经验，与得到的幸福生活。马上激起了该村群众，自动逮捕斗争对象党来子等八人，开大会斗争，大家诉了苦，又要求民兵刺死党来子。他们又耐心的向群众解释，苦要自己诉，仇要自己报，提高了群众的斗争意志，党来子便被群众处死了。从此，西里村突破了斗争，影响了周围村庄，群众也展开了斗争，并要求民兵前往帮助他们翻身。又一部在三区北赵村担任警戒时，用尽一切办法，团结与教育了黄河水手，帮助民兵及群众，捉拿斗争对象十三人。
