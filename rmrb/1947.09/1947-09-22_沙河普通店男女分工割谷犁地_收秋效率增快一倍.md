    Shahe Putongdian Implements Division of Labor Between Men and Women in Harvesting Grain and Plowing
    Autumn Harvest Efficiency Doubles
    [Reported by our Shahe correspondent] After returning to the village from a meeting in the sixth district on the 27th day of the seventh lunar month, the village cadres of Putongdian Village immediately convened a general meeting of male and female members of the Farmers' Association that evening. They first reported on the autumn harvest and wheat planting competition situation in the district (see page two, September 20th), mobilizing the masses to compete in the autumn harvest. The four major groups and twenty subgroups in the village first conducted a short period of preparation, collectively discussing numbers. Together, the whole village planted 2,720 mu of wheat, exceeding the district's planned target by 220 mu. Subsequently, discussions were held on when to finish planting and how to speed up the planting process. Cui Qifu took the lead in challenging the other three groups, followed by enthusiastic discussions and the proposal of competition conditions by the East, West, and South Street groups. Everyone competed to finish planting wheat by the 16th day of the eighth lunar month, and it was stipulated that models would be selected and achievements recognized after the wheat planting. After the meeting, each group acted quickly. On the first day, both male and female laborers harvested grain together. After the land was cleared, labor was divided, with women mainly harvesting grain, men cutting stubble, children chopping grain, and carts transporting it. After cutting stubble, people were assigned to plow the land, connecting the processes tightly. In Zhang Shuncheng's group in West Street, there were 17 male full laborers, 6 semi-laborers, and 7 women. On the 30th day of the seventh month, in addition to chopping 3 mu of grain, they also harvested 7 mu of grain, cut stubble on 40 mu, and harrowed 16 mu. In the past, men could only cut stubble on 2 mu per day. This year, with mutual aid, Chen Xiaowen's group of seven people cut stubble for half a day, resulting in an average of 1.7 mu per person. Du Run's group of eleven laborers harvested 8 fen of grain, chopped grain spikes on 3 mu, and cut stubble on 6 mu before noon on the first day of the eighth lunar month. Hou Bian, despite being pregnant, also led more than 20 women in two subgroups to harvest grain. By the first day of the eighth lunar month, over 80% of the village's grain had been harvested. Deng Jian's group used to wait for the signal to gather before going to the fields. This time, no one waited for the signal; they went immediately after eating, much faster than before. The method of calculating wages was flexible. Women who performed as well as men earned the same wages as men. The general wage for women was 3 jin and 2 liang per day, while men earned 5 jin and 4 liang. In previous years, no women participated in cutting stubble, but this year, many women participated. Zhao Zi, Jing Di, Xiang Di, and others, all female children under the age of fourteen, cut stubble on one mu in half a day. As a result, the harvesting time was more than twice as fast as in previous years. Currently, the whole village is making a concentrated effort to plow and harrow the land, and wheat planting will also begin immediately. (Gao Qian, Cong Li, Kuilin)
    [Also reported] After the cadres of Xicui Village signed up for a rapid harvesting and planting competition with other villages at the district meeting, they returned to the village on the 14th and convened a mass meeting that evening to launch the competition. On the 16th, all twenty-three mutual aid groups in the village started working in the fields with 131 male laborers, 80 female laborers, and 50 male and female children. Each group divided labor according to the work, assigning people to harvest grain, chop grain, thresh, cut stubble, and transport manure. As soon as the land was cleared, it was plowed. In one day, they harvested 111 mu of grain, piled up 13 mu, chopped 64 mu of grain, threshed 15 mu, transported 52 loads of grain (from the fields back), cut stubble on 86 mu, harrowed grain stubble on 15 mu, and plowed 7 mu of land. In the evening, each group summarized the day's achievements and arranged the next day's work. Now, each group is full of confidence in winning the glorious banner.

    收秋效率增快一倍
    【本报沙河讯】六区普通店村干部，于阴历七月廿七日从区开会回村后，当天晚上就召开了全体农会男女会员大会。先报告了在区上竞赛秋收种麦情况（见九月二十日二版），发动群众，竞赛收秋，全村四大组廿个小组先作了短时间的酝酿，各自碰了碰数，合起来全村种麦二千七百廿亩，超过在区上计划的二百二十亩。随后又讨论几时种完？怎样能种的快？崔起福最先向其他三组提出挑战，接着东、西、南街三个大组就纷纷议论提出竞赛条件。大家争先要在阴历八月十六就要种完麦子，并规定种麦后评功选模。会后各组都迅速行动起来，头一天都是男女劳力一齐割谷，腾出地来就分了工，妇女主要割谷、男人＠茬、儿童切谷、大车搬运，＠茬后就抽人犁地，紧紧的连接起来。西街张顺成小组男全劳力十七个、半劳力六个、妇女七个，七月三十日一天内除切谷三亩外，又割谷七亩、＠茬四十亩、耙地十六亩。过去男人每天只能＠茬二亩，今年互助起来，陈效文组七个人了＠半天，结果每人就合一亩七分。妇女杜润的组十一个劳力，八月初一日半天割谷八分，削谷穗三亩，＠了六亩茬天还不大晌午。侯便的怀孕还带领着两个妇女小组二十多人割谷。到八月初一止，全村谷子已割了百分之八十以上。邓俭的组过去都是听到牌子集合起来才往地里走，这次谁也不等打牌子了，吃了饭马上就走，比以先下地快的多了。等价办法都是死分活用，妇女赶上男人的就和男人一样赚工资，一般妇女工资是每天三斤二两，男人是五斤四两。往年的妇女没人参加过＠茬，今年有不少妇女参加了。赵自的、井的、香的等四人，都是十四岁以下的女儿童，她四人半天＠了一亩茬。因此收成时间比往年快了一倍还多。现全村正在全力突击犁地耙地，种麦也要马上下手了。（高谦、从理、奎林）
