Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 24th. The Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's recently hyped "Beiping City Council Member Election" has completely failed. The Chiang bandits' ugly pretense of rigging the election and fabricating "democracy" has spread both domestically and abroad. According to a United Press dispatch from Beiping on the 21st, "The election was dictated from above by the Kuomintang and directed by the heads of the baojia system. Mayor He Siyuan admitted to reporters that the people seemed uninterested in voting, with less than a quarter of eligible voters registering. Conversations with shop assistants, rickshaw pullers, and laborers revealed that not one in ten had even heard of the election. Chinese newspapers reported that voters and candidates did not understand each other, and the people suspected it was just 'another show.' They believed that the City Council was merely a rubber-stamping body that could only decide on local taxes and could not appoint local officials." A French Press Agency dispatch on the same day reported on the "election" situation, stating: "At most polling places, the majority of voters were served by official scribes who wrote down the names of candidates for the citizens. The number of people participating in the election was very small. Most of the people the reporter asked on the street said they were unwilling to go through with it unless the police forced them to, saying the election had nothing to do with them because all the candidates were designated or approved by the authorities."

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th. As the Chiang bandit's ugly farce of pseudo-National Assembly delegate and pseudo-Legislator "elections" is about to begin, the Chiang bandits and the political beggar parties, the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party, are engaging in mutual hooliganism, displaying all sorts of ugly behavior. According to an Associated Press dispatch from Nanjing on the 23rd, the Youth Party is attempting to obtain more pseudo-National Assembly delegates, pseudo-Legislators, and some provincial governorships as the price for continuing to collude with the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, otherwise "threatening" to refuse to "hand over the list of candidates," feigning strength in an attempt to get more leftovers. Although the Democratic Socialist Party has submitted a list of 400 pseudo-National Assembly "candidates," it is also "attempting to bargain for a higher price," hoping to gnaw on a few more bones. The Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, which monopolizes the pseudo-National Assembly delegate and legislator "elections," is using hooligan tactics to deal with hooligan tactics, saying, "We will help you as much as possible, but the choice of the voters (?) must not be subject to any restrictions," to show its refusal.

    蒋匪伪造“民主”丑态泄露
    北平市选破产
    【新华社陕北二十四日电】蒋家匪帮最近喧嚷的“北平市参议会员选举”完全破产，蒋匪包办选举伪造“民主”的丑态，已传播中外。据合众社北平二十一日电报导称：“选举系由国民党自上规定，由保甲长指挥。何思源市长对记者们承认人民对投票似乎不感兴趣，合格的选民前往登记的不及四分之一。店员、人力车夫与工役的谈话中表示出，十个人没有一个人曾听说过有选举这一回事。中国报纸报导，选民和候选人互相不了解，人民猜想这又是‘一出戏’，他们认为市参议会只是一个盖印机关，能对地方的赋税有所决定，更不能任命地方官吏”。同日法新社电讯报导“选举”情形称：“在投票处大多数的投票者均由官方缮写人效劳，替市民写上候选人名字。参加选举的人数很少。记者在街上所询问过的人中，大多数表示除非警察强迫他们做，否则他们是不愿走此一遭的，他们说选举与他们毫无关系，因为全部候选人都是由当局指定或批准的。”
    【新华社陕北二十六日电】在蒋匪伪国大代表伪立委“选举”丑剧行将揭幕之际，蒋匪与政治乞丐民社、青年两党之间互耍流氓手段，丑态百出，据美联社南京二十三日电透露，青年党企图以取得更多伪国代伪立委及若干省政府主席的位子，作为与蒋家匪帮继续勾搭的代价，否则以拒绝“交出候选人名单”为“威胁”，装腔作势，想借此多讨冷饭残羹；民社党虽然提出了四百名伪国代“候选人名单”，但也“同样企图讨高一点价钱”，多啃几块骨头；而一手垄断伪国代、立委“选举”的蒋家匪帮，则用流氓手段对付流氓手段，说什么“我们尽可能帮助你们，但是选民（？）的抉择决不能受任何的限制”，以示拒绝。
