　　Wang Yuanshou's Autobiography
　　　　Ziye Ji
　　Wang Yuanshou's working style in the land reform has been praised by the Jin-Ji District Party Committee, as detailed in the two articles "Learning from Wang Yuanshou" and "Wang Yuanshou Visits Blind Niu" on page two of this newspaper on August 26th. His autobiography is reprinted here as a supplement. -- Editor

　　I am forty-five years old this year, and my home is in Haojia Village, District One, Pinging. Because my family is poor, I cannot afford to marry a wife, and I am still single. I have not attended school, have low literacy, and cannot read. My family originally consisted of six people: my father, mother, three brothers, and one sister.

　　We farmed four or five mu of "dry bone" land, which was not enough to feed a family of six or seven, so we rented eight mu from others. Renting eight mu was equivalent to two mu, so we had to pay rent as if we had ten mu. One mu required three dou and five sheng, so ten mu was three shi and five dou. Every year, we ate official grain (charity granary), returning one shi and two dou for every shi borrowed. The land wasn't fertile, and in good years we harvested four shi of grain and two shi of corn. By the time autumn came and we settled the rent and repaid the official grain, we only had a few shi of corn left, and the whole family drank gruel in the winter.

　　The rent was too high, and sometimes the harvested grain was not enough to pay it. If we were short even one dou, the rent slip would be returned. My father would have to go and plead with them. It was truly difficult to talk to the wealthy landlords. It didn't matter if you went early or late, you were always treated poorly, and you had to endure being scolded and bullied. We had to borrow money at high interest rates to make up the shortfall. The manager had a red beard, and when we were young, we had to call him grandpa. When that thing got angry, my father would brew him a pot of wine, heat it up, and kneel to offer it. My father was an honest man, wanting to avoid trouble and not daring to offend anyone.

　　When I was nine years old, I herded cows for others. By the time I was fifteen or sixteen, I started working as a long-term laborer. In the old society, being a long-term laborer was practically begging at the door. Throughout the year, we only ate five meals of white flour: two on the first and fifteenth of the Lunar New Year, one on the sixth of June, one on the fifteenth of July, and one on the fifteenth of October when the work ended. In the pot, there were both white flour steamed buns and cornbread buns, and when you stuck your chopsticks in, you could only poke the yellow ones, not daring to touch the white ones.

　　We worked from before dawn until after dark. In the morning, while others were still sound asleep, we long-term laborers had to get up. After dinner, when others went to rest, we long-term laborers still had to grind grain and carry water. There were two sayings circulating among long-term laborers: "Don't want it to be sunny when it rains, don't want it to be bright when it's dark," but in reality, we couldn't rest even when it rained or was dark.

　　During festivals, everyone in the countryside loves to watch a play, but long-term laborers don't dare watch too much, fearing they won't be able to get up the next day.

　　Once the autumn harvest was over, we closed the threshing floor gate, put on a tattered hat, and went home with a few worn-out clothes. The wealthy closed the threshing floor gate and prepared to slaughter pigs and sheep for the New Year, while the poor were busy begging for food.

　　At that time, I believed poverty was my fate.

　　After the War of Resistance Against Japan began in 1938, the village established a labor union. The first time I was called, I was scared and didn't go. The second time I was called, I only dared to go when I saw others going. Later, the labor union elected me as the director. At that time, I saw that long-term laborers earned thirty yuan a year. At most, it was no more than forty yuan, but the price of millet was eight yuan per dou, so thirty or forty yuan could only buy four or five dou. The county labor union director said that the wages were too low and needed to be increased. The long-term laborers united and fought with the manager, and we won, increasing the wages to a certain shi of rice. I thought this was not bad, and I began to realize that the Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army could indeed do things for the poor.

　　Two or three years before the Incident, there were rumors that miraculous soldiers appeared in the west, disappearing after a single strike, and appearing again if not struck. I wondered: What was that!? After the Incident, I learned that they were the predecessor of the Eighth Route Army – the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army.

　　I considered in my mind: Although the Eighth Route Army was not yet strong, it was effective.

　　I joined the Party in 1940. After serving as the village labor union director, I also served as the director of the Anti-Japanese Association for more than a year. Before the surrender of the Japanese invaders, I was promoted to the district committee member, and then served as the director of the district labor union for a year. Last year, I was transferred to the county labor union.

　　When I was a district committee member, I encountered a setback in my work. The year before last, in July, I was sent to Zhangjiajing to expand the army. The village cadres were more capable and better educated than me, and they looked down on me. They wanted to tie up the shepherd workers, but I refused. The village cadres got angry with me, saying that I was sabotaging the army expansion and criticizing me. I apologized to them. I felt very wronged, but I did not lose heart. I returned to the district and explained the situation clearly.

　　I also remember a few rules when I do work: do not be greedy, do not be corrupt, do not love other people's things, do not bully good peasants, and do not engage in乱搞男女关系 (illicit relations). Set an example and sacrifice yourself.

　　In the past, some cadres, when they went down [to the villages], would immediately go to the shops and good houses, always wanting to get something good to eat and live comfortably. I was very uncomfortable with them. Seeing them so affectionate, talking and laughing, I was restrained on the side, unable to get in, and didn't want to get in. I would find an opportunity to slip away and go to the poor people's houses to eat and stay. I could talk about anything with the poor people, freely and unrestrainedly, like returning home. I always feel that I have the bones of a poor man, do not know how to enjoy happiness, and only know how to associate with poor people. When people offered me cigarettes, I would take out my own dry tobacco and smoke it, not touching theirs.

　　In the past, I didn't know if what I was doing was right, and I didn't know what the mass line was. I only learned a little bit this time when I attended the meeting in the county.

　　The newspaper published an article introducing me, and the superiors issued a call to learn from me. This is truly something I never dreamed of. I am both happy and feel a heavier burden on my shoulders. I must work harder and study harder in the future, especially learning culture. I often feel the pain of being uneducated, but I am afraid that I am too old to learn.

### 王元寿自述

　　王元寿自述
    子野记
    王元寿在土改中的工作作风，已受晋冀区党委之表扬，详见本报八月二十六日二版，“学习王元寿”与“王元寿访瞎牛”两文，兹将他的自述转载于此以作补充——编者
    我今年四十五岁，家在平定一区郝家庄。因为家贫，娶不起媳妇，现在还是独身汉。没有念过书，文化低，不识字。从小家里六口人：爹、妈、兄三人、姊妹一人。
    养种四五亩“干骨”地，一家六、七口人不够吃，租种人家八亩。租八亩代两亩，交租要交十亩。一亩交三斗五，十亩就是三石五。年年吃官谷（义仓），一石还一石二。地不强，好年景打四石谷、两石玉茭，赶到秋天盘盘租、还还官谷只丢下石数来玉茭，冬天全家喝糊糊。
    租地租重，有时打下的谷不够交租，少交一斗，租贴就送回来。父亲就得去给人家说好话。和财主家说话真难，去早去晚都不沾，挨骂受气也得受下去。短租子借债也得补上。掌柜的红胡髭，我们小时赶着叫爷爷，那东西一发脾气，我父亲就给他打上一壶酒，烫热了跪着送上去。我父亲是个老实人，省事，不敢惹人。
    我九岁上给人家放牛，赶上十五六岁就开始扛长工。民国九年遭下荒年，我那时十八岁，家里光景不能过，父亲走荫营，我去寿阳要了一冬饭。
    从九岁算起，我扛长工扛了三十年。在旧社会里扛长工的实际上是门里要饭。一年到头只吃人家五顿白面：过年初一、十五两顿，六月六一顿，七月十五一顿，十月十五下工一顿。人家锅里一边放的是白面馍，一边放的是窝窝，筷子伸下去就只能插那黄的，不敢去动那白的。
    一天干活两头黑，早上天不亮人家正睡得香，咱们扛长工的就得起来啦，吃过晚饭别人都去歇了，扛长工的还要给人家推磨、担水。扛长工的中间流行着两句话：“天雨不要晴，天黑不要明，”其实天雨天黑也不能歇。
    乡下人逢年过节，谁不爱听个戏，可是扛长工的就不敢多看，看多了怕第二天起不来。
    赶上秋收一完，关了场门戴上一顶破帽，夹了几件坏衣服回家。有钱的关了场门准备杀猪宰羊过年，穷人们忙着要饭。
    我那时相信穷是命苦。
    民国二十七年抗战以后，村上成立了工会，第一次叫害怕，没有去。第二次叫，看见别人都去了才敢去。后头工会选上我顶主任。那时看长工一年挣三十元。顶多也不过四十元，小米价是八块钱一斗，三、四十元只能买四、五斗。县上工会主任来说工资太低，要增加，扛长工的齐心和掌柜的斗争，胜利了，增到石数来米，心想这可不赖，开始认识到共产党八路军确实能给穷人办事。
    还在事变以前两三年传说西边出现了神兵，一打就没有了，一不打就有了。我心想：那是怎的！？事变后才知道是八路军的前身——工农红军。
    我脑筋里考虑着：八路力量虽还不大，可是顶事。
    民国二十九年参加党。我顶村工会以后又顶了一年多抗联主任，日寇投降前提拔为小区委员，又顶了一年区工会主任，去年才调到县工会上来。
    顶小区委员时工作中碰过一次钉子。前年七月派我去张家井扩军。村干部能力比我强，文化比我高，瞧我不起。他们要捆放羊工人，我说不沾，村干部和我生气，说我破坏扩军，打击我，我给人家道歉一顿。心里很受委曲，可是我没有垂头丧气，回到区上把事情说清楚。
    我做工作也记着几个条条：不要贪污，不要腐化，不要爱人家的东西，不要欺负好农民，不要乱搞男女关系。起模范作用牺牲自己。
    以前有些干部下去，一钻就钻到商号里，好房子里去，总想弄点好的吃吃，住得舒服些。我和他们在一起很不习惯，看到他们那样亲亲热热，有说有笑，我在一边拘拘束束，插不进去，也不想插进去，找个空子溜走，走到穷人家去吃、去住。和穷人在一起，什么也能谈，无拘无束，象回到家了一样。我老是觉得自己是穷骨头，不懂得享福，只会交接穷人。人家递给香烟，自己掏出旱烟来抽，不去动那。
    以前我也不知道这样做对不对，也不知道什么叫群众路线，这次在县上开了会才知道了一点点。
    报纸上登了介绍我的文章，上级又提出号召向我学习，这真是我梦想不到的，又高兴，又感到肩膀重了，以后更要好好努力学习，特别是学文化，我常常感到没有文化的痛苦，只是年纪大了，怕学不进。
