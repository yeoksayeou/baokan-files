　　Qi Zhi Loans 30 Million
  　Helping Poor Peasants Plant Wheat
    [Reported from Qi Zhi by our newspaper] Qi Zhi has issued 30 million yuan in wheat planting loans. This loan is mainly to support poor peasants in planting wheat on a large scale, solving their difficulties with draught cattle and wheat seeds. In order to ensure that the loans are effectively delivered to the poor peasants, a thorough review of past loan work was conducted: 1. Leaders held a charitable view of loan work, neglecting it beforehand, pushing it down hastily, and conducting evaluations in a dispersed manner. In the spring agricultural loans, some villages distributed only 70 yuan per household. 2. Some loans were simply used to solve the difficulties of village cadres, such as village cadres in Zheng Village, Liu Township, and Xima Lian Gu using loans for business. 3. Following the middle peasant line, village cadres handled everything, failing to concentrate loans to the poor peasants effectively. After identifying these biases, it was clearly stated that this loan should fully mobilize poor peasants and new middle peasants, enhancing their enthusiasm for production and enabling poor peasants to organize themselves in mutual aid groups. Poor peasants and families of military personnel have priority in obtaining loans. This loan must be used entirely for wheat planting, expanding the wheat planting area to achieve increased production, and must not be used for other business activities. The loan amount for each district is allocated according to the severity of the disaster. In addition to the need for wheat seeds by some of the masses, most need draught cattle. It is planned to increase draught cattle by 335 heads. Districts 5 and 4 can each reclaim an additional 20 hectares of wasteland. The county-wide wheat planting area is planned to expand to over 70%, and efforts will be made to complete planting before the first frost. (Fan Lun, Huo Feng)

　　企之贷款三千万
  　帮助贫农种麦
    【本报企之讯】企之发放种麦贷款三千万元，这次贷款主要是支持贫农大量种麦，解决其耕牛与麦种的困难，为了很好的将款贷到贫农手里，对过去贷款工作，作了一个深刻的检查：一、领导上对贷款工作存在着恩赐观点，事前不注意，临时推下去，评议时分散，去春农贷有的村每户分七十元。二、有的单纯的解决了村干困难，如郑村柳町西马连固村干以贷款做买卖。三、中农路线、村干包办，没很好集中贷给贫农，检查出这些偏向后，明确提出这次贷款要充分发动贫农及新的中农，提高其生产情绪，使贫农自己组织串连，贫农军属其贷款中有优先权。这次贷款要完全用在种麦上，要扩大种麦面积求得增产，不得做其他经营。各区贷款数目，根据灾荒情形分配，除部分群众需要麦种外，大部需耕牛，计划增加耕牛三百三十五头，五区四区各能多开荒二十顷。全县种麦面积计划扩大至百分之七十以上，并争取在霜降前一律种上。　　（范纶、霍锋）
