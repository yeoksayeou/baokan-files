Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 5th: The result of Yan Xishan's lamentable conscription has created a military and political predicament for him. The Jin Sui People's Liberation Army recently seized a secret internal publication of the Yan army, "Iron Army Soul," issue 43, which contained Yan's admonition to his trusted subordinates on June 7th at the "Ten Day" routine meeting, stating: "The harm of conscription is the harm of all politics and military affairs. First, we have lost political trust. The people say that my words don't count. Second, we have lost political integrity. Our politics are equal to bandits, no different from bandit behavior. Third, because of the conscription, all the recruits have run away, making it impossible to implement military service administration. Military service personnel are equal to useless people. Fourth, without people in the villages, we cannot collect grain, and the army will starve to death. Fifth, if the people run away and no one farms, the military and civilians will have nothing to eat in the future." Finally, Traitor Yan shouted in despair: "We can't survive."
    Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 5th: Because of repeated military failures, Traitor Yan became enraged and dismissed and detained Ai Ziqian, the commander of the 72nd Division, who had suffered repeated defeats. He also cancelled the division's designation, and its remnants were transferred to Taiyuan and dispersed into the 69th Division and the Training Division. According to reports, the entire 215th Regiment and the entire third battalion of the 214th Regiment, along with the third company and machine gun company of the first battalion, all under the jurisdiction of Traitor Yan's 72nd Division, were annihilated by the People's Liberation Army in Kai Zhaidong Village, Wenshui, between February and March of this year. Its 216th Regiment was completely annihilated in Xiaoyi Town on July 4th.

　　阎贼绝望哀鸣  大叫活不成了
    【新华社晋绥五日电】阎锡山悲鸣抓丁结果已造成其军事政治的绝境。晋绥解放军最近缴获的阎军内部秘密刊物“铁军魂”第四十三期，其中载有六月七日阎贼在“十日”例会上对其亲信部下的训词称：“抓丁的害，是全部政治军事的害。第一失了政信，老百姓说，我说的话不算话。第二是失了政格，我们的政治等于土匪，与土匪行为无异。第三是因抓兵壮丁全跑了，使兵役行政不能推行。兵役人员等于废人。第四村中无人不能征粮，军队就要饿死。第五人民跑了没人种地，将来军民均不会有饭吃。”最后阎贼绝望的叫喊：“我们活不成了”。
    【新华社晋绥五日电】阎贼因军事屡遭失败，恼羞成怒，对连战连败的七十二师师长艾子谦撤职拘审，并取消该师番号，其残部调赴太原，编散于六十九师及亲训师。按阎贼七十二师所辖二一五团全部及二一四团三营全部与一营之三连及机枪连，于今春二三月间在文水开栅东社遭解放军歼灭，其二一六团又于七月四日在孝义镇全部被歼灭。
