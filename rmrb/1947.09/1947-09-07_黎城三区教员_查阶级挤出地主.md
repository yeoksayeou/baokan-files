　　Licheng Third District Teachers
　　Investigate Class Status, Squeeze Out Landlords
　　[Report from our newspaper in Licheng] The Third District convened a meeting of teachers and education directors to discuss how to serve the masses by investigating class status, ideology, and actions. They exposed landlords Wang Shanji and Liu Shangqin who were bullying the masses and using their positions as teachers as camouflage. Wang Shanji is from Tuling Village in this county and is the largest landlord in the village. Currently a teacher in Zaozhen Village, during the land reform movement, he not only refused to bow his head to the masses but also used his position as a teacher to reveal his landlord nature, oppressing the masses, and committing adultery with a women's rescue cadre in the village, stirring up discord between couples. He also exploited child labor, making them carry water, chop firewood, and hold his child for his wife, arousing public resentment. In order to facilitate himself, he requested more teachers under the pretext of strengthening his work, and without asking anyone for leave, he went to Changzhi to attend a meeting for seven days, spreading rumors and undermining the prestige of the cadres. Liu Shangqin is from Tinghepu in this county, from a landlord family, and is a teacher in Shanghuan Village. He secretly moved two good quilts, two pillows, and several pieces of clothing from home and hid them in the school, unwilling to repay his debts. After everyone struggled against these two bad elements, it was decided that Wang Shanji be dismissed from his post, the rice he earned from the masses be returned to the masses, and he be sent to the government for punishment. Liu Shangqin was handed over to the masses of his village for disposal. (En Kui, Fu Xiang, Huo Fu, Sen Kui)

  　查阶级挤出地主
    【本报黎城讯】三区召开教员教育主任会议，讨论如何为群众服务，查阶级查思想查行动，当场揭发出地主王善继、刘尚勤，欺负群众，并借自己职务当隐身草。王善继是本县土岭村人，是该村第一户大地主，现任枣镇村教员，土地改革运动中，不但不向群众低头，还借教员地位，露出地主本质，欺压群众，和该村某某妇救干部通奸，挑拨人家夫妇不和；并剥削儿童劳动给他老婆担水、打柴、抱孩，引起群众不满。又为了自己方便，借口加强工作，要求增加教员，不经任何人请假到长治赶会七天，并造谣破坏干部威信。刘尚勤系本县停河铺人，地主出身，任上浣村教员，自己回家偷搬来好被两条，枕头两个，衣服数件，隐藏学校不愿还债。这两个坏蛋经过大家斗争，决议王善继撤职，赚群众的米退还群众，并送政府惩处。刘尚勤交给本村群众处理。（恩魁、富祥、火福、森魁）
