Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 17th: To vigorously support the People's Liberation Army's major counter-offensive, the war support organizations in Anping, Anguo, Xinle, and other counties in Hebei-Central have been reorganized and are ready to set out. In addition to the expeditionary stretcher-bearer teams and transport teams accompanying the army, each county has also formed militia expeditionary forces. Xinle County has formed six militia expeditionary companies. Raoyang, on the other hand, has organized stretcher-bearers, transport, and militia into a regiment. Jin County has an even larger scale, with two regiments of well-trained militia, totaling 6,100 people, ready for the expedition. The stretcher-bearer teams in each county are divided into frontline light stretcher teams and transfer stretcher teams, with reclining chair-style stretcher teams. The stretchers are equipped with sunshades, quilts, pillows, and water bottles, bowls, towels, and anti-gas and anti-air raid equipment for the wounded. Many farmers have taken out their own thermos bottles to equip the stretcher-bearer teams. On the stretcher pillows in An'guo and Anping counties, the words "Revolutionary Duty, Unforgettable in Dreams" and "Strive for Merit" are embroidered, and consolation letters are written inside the sunshade tops. Each county has held short-term training classes for participation in the war, training a large number of stretcher-bearer and militia cadres, and has held grand reviews and exercises, conducting practical drills in rescuing the wounded, responding to enemy situations, and preventing gas and air raids.

Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 17th: The local armed forces of the Eighth Sub-district of Hebei-Central (including Jinghai and Qingxian in Southern Tianjin), which is close to Tianjin, fought 279 battles against the Chiang bandits in the past eight months, killing, wounding, and capturing a total of 2,668 Chiang bandits, seizing 2 artillery pieces, 30 machine guns, and 1,189 rifles and pistols. They successively recovered 18 strongholds, and lost and regained 14.
