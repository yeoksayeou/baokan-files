To learn from Comrade Da Ke's spirit, the General Headquarters called on all comrades to commemorate this gloriously martyred comrade by intensifying the movement to examine "客里空" [Ke Li Kong], correct shortcomings, and improve professional skills. The full text of the General Headquarters' condolence telegram to the East China General Branch is as follows:

To the East China General Branch and the family of Comrade Song Da Ke: We are deeply saddened to learn of Comrade Da Ke's glorious sacrifice on the front line. Comrade Da Ke served the people and the army, went deep into the company and integrated with the soldiers, and conducted interviews on the front lines of battle. This spirit and style is worthy of being called a student of Chairman Mao and a model for our journalists. At a time when journalists across the Party are conducting a movement to examine "客里空", Comrade Da Ke's working spirit and style are particularly worthy of our journalists to learn from, so as to correct our shortcomings and mistakes and further improve our work. We firmly believe that after Comrade Da Ke's sacrifice, thousands of Da Ke comrades will be cultivated. Then Comrade Da Ke, though dead, lives on and remains alive in everyone's hearts. We hereby express our condolences and hope you will restrain your grief.

Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 26th - The East China Front Branch of the Xinhua News Agency has called for learning from the exemplary role of Comrade Song Da Ke, a frontline reporter. Comrade Da Ke dedicated himself to frontline military propaganda. After assessment by the branch and the Political Department of the Column, his main advantages and achievements are as follows: He had a down-to-earth and simple work style, worked diligently, respected the cadres of the troops, went deep into the company, and won the unanimous love of commanders and fighters. In terms of professional skills, he was humble in learning, had a spirit of research and creativity, thoroughly implemented the correct policy of news work serving the war and serving the troops, and engaged in interviews and reports of previous battles with tireless spirit, and focused on praising heroes and models, which greatly boosted morale and promoted revolutionary heroism. The soldiers took it as a great honor to say "Let Song Da Ge [Big Brother Song] report on it in the newspaper." Comrade Da Ke also closely integrated with the daily military and political work of the troops, personally participated in the work of the troops, and reported on the dynamics and experiences of various mass movements in the troops. Comrade Da Ke was also good at photography and painting. In addition to helping the regimental newspaper write articles and organize communication networks, he often helped the regimental newspaper with layout design and designed masthead illustrations, and his works were very popular among the soldiers. In battle, Comrade Da Ke often went to the front line to take battlefield photos and combined photography with political mobilization. Some soldiers expressed their determination before the battle, saying: "This battle must be completed, and then let Song Da Ge take a picture of me."

Also reported: The Political Department of a certain column of the East China People's Liberation Army has issued a decision to commemorate Comrade Song Da Ke, a frontline reporter, calling on all journalists and Party newspaper correspondents in the entire column to learn and carry forward Comrade Song Da Ke's example of closely integrating the cultural front with the military front, and stipulating four commemorative measures: (1) Posthumously award Comrade Song Da Ke the title of Model Reporter of the Column and promote him to a First-Class Meritorious Citizen. (2) The Column's "麓水报" [Lu Shui Bao] publish a special memorial issue and hold a memorial service. (3) Launch a mass communication and reporting movement. The political organs of various divisions and regiments should organize forces to uniformly lead wartime interview work and make it a fixed system. (4) Stipulate that every year from the "September 1st" Journalists' Day to "September 9th", all comrades of the newspaper office and branch hold a memory evening to summarize experience and evaluate merit.
