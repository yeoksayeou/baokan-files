Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 24th: The famine relief movement in various parts of the Hebei-Shanxi region has gradually unfolded. After 160,000 mu of bare land in Qu Yang County were all sown with buckwheat and turnips, most villages have now shifted to transport, sales, and sideline business. In a certain district of Yu County, the masses were organized to rush-plant over 1,500 mu of autumn vegetables. Wangjiatun Village in that county organized 220 semi-laborers and planted 500 mu of vegetables in two days. The Daduitou Village cooperative organized the masses to transport and sell 20 shi of rice. 185 peasant households in Xijingdi Village, Xingtang County, formed a collection team and went to areas 30 li away to collect wild vegetables, collecting over 20,000 jin in thirteen days. Over 1,000 primary school students in a certain district of that county formed a famine relief propaganda team, conducting propaganda while collecting wild vegetables, collecting 300,000 jin in half a month. The masses in Beiqiao and other villages in that county generally saved food rations. In Pindg County, the most severely affected by the drought, the democratic government, in addition to distributing some late-season seeds, also loaned 600 shi of grain, and has supported the start of 153 iron mines. The Hanhegou and Yinying iron-sulfur industries have resumed production. The county government has also set up transportation and supply stations in Yangquan and Pingdi, and sent people to the Taihang, Hebei Central, and Wutai areas to open up sales channels for coal and iron. The local masses have now organized over 2,000 heads of livestock and raised over 19 million yuan to engage in transportation and sales. Cooperatives in various villages in Pingding are meeting the needs of disaster victims by purchasing grain and bran for the masses and selling iron goods on their behalf. The Hebei-Shanxi Fourth Military Subdistrict Bank has also loaned 10,000,000 yuan in border currency to support poor farmers in developing transportation and sales.
