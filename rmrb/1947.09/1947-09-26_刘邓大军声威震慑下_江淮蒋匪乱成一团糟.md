Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains Front, 24th: This reporter, following the Liu-Deng army in its advance into the Chiang-controlled areas of the Central Plains, has heard and witnessed complete confirmation that Chiang Kai-shek’s "general mobilization" is in reality heading towards a "total collapse." The Chiang bandits, whether in military, political, or economic terms, are showing a state of decline beyond repair. In Nanxu County, south of the Longhai Railway, the big and small lackeys of the county government, after the "general mobilization" order, planned to conscript 10,000 "volunteer soldiers" from the entire county, ten from each bao (group of households), to be sent to the county for training before the end of July. However, no one "volunteered," so large numbers of security regiments were dispatched to the countryside every day to capture able-bodied men. The masses tried their best to escape. From July 15th to August 5th, they had not even captured 500 people. In the process of capturing recruits, the soldiers of the security regiments took the opportunity to desert, numbering more than 350. So the captured recruits had to replenish the deserters of the security regiments, and the training of "volunteer soldiers" had to be stopped. Most of these security regiments were new recruits. As soon as they came into contact with the People's Liberation Army, they scattered and fled for their lives, and the newly captured recruits took the opportunity to go home. Under the awe-inspiring power of the People's Liberation Army, the big and small local officials of the Chiang bandits fled at the mere sound of the wind. The county magistrates of various counties north and south of the Huai River and along the Yangtze River mostly packed up their valuables and fled to large cities such as Jiujiang and Hankou. The People's Liberation Army often occupied county towns with only a small number of troops. When we liberated Jingfu County, our army had no more than a platoon of soldiers. Those who fled brought even greater panic to other cities. According to merchants recently returned from Jiujiang, the market in Jiujiang was in chaos, the urban area was under curfew at night, and the streets and alleys were silent. According to visitors from Hankou, when the vanguard of the People's Liberation Army advanced to only eighty miles from Hankou, even during the day, suddenly someone shouted "The Eighth Route Army is coming!" Instantly, people and horses were in a flurry, and sirens blared, creating utter chaos. At the same time, prices in these cities and nearby areas soared wildly, and Chiang currency became worthless paper. In Jiujiang, a land of fish and rice, although new rice was on the market, the price of rice still soared wildly, and the prices of all other goods rose sharply. As a result, Chiang currency of 500 or less was regarded as waste paper even in remote villages. Inside ordinary businesses, piles and bundles of Chiang currency could be seen stacked in corners and under beds, or used as children's toys, or as fuel for fire. Some women even used it to make paper soles for shoes, and most commonly, it was used to wallpaper houses, which was both economical and aesthetically pleasing.

    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 21st: Under the dark and hopeless rule of the Chiang bandits, the families of lower-ranking officers and soldiers of the Chiang army lived extremely miserably. According to a Guangzhou dispatch published in the Peiping Jing Shi Daily on the 28th of last month, a young woman from Hunan, Liu Baifeng, married a Cantonese military officer, Lu Haosheng, and lived at No. 77, Lingli, Weixin Road, Guangzhou. After Lu left with the army this spring, his wife was unable to maintain her livelihood and was soon induced and sold into prostitution, and taken elsewhere. When Lu was transferred back to Guangdong and returned home, everything had changed. After inquiring in many ways and going through many twists and turns, he was finally able to meet Liu in a brothel, and the two embraced and cried bitterly. Yang Qunfeng, the wife of Chiang army soldier Long Sheng, lived with her two children on Nanlu Road in Guangzhou. Three months ago, Long Sheng was transferred to Anhui. Yang was also困 by life and was about to give birth. Unable to think of a solution, she had the idea of ending her life. On the 18th, she secretly took forty sleeping pills and committed suicide. In the middle of the night, the poison took effect and she moaned and tossed about. She was discovered by neighbors and sent to the hospital for treatment. She only woke up on the 19th. Her son, seven years old, and her daughter, five years old, lay beside the bed and cried incessantly, in a most tragic state.

    刘邓大军声威震慑下
    江淮蒋匪乱成一团糟
    【新华社中原前线二十四日电】记者随刘邓大军挺进中原蒋区作战，耳闻目睹，完全证实了蒋匪的“总动员”十足是在走向“总崩溃”。蒋匪无论在军事、政治及经济上都表现出江河日下，不可收拾的态势。陇海路南雎县县府大小奴才们于“总动员”令后，曾计划全县征调“志愿兵”一万人，每保组十人，限期七月底前送县集训；但人民无人“应征”，于是每日分派大批保安团下乡抓捕壮丁，群众则竭力设法逃避，从七月十五日到八月五日尚未抓够五百人，而在抓丁中，保安团士兵则乘机逃跑，为数达三百五十多名，于是抓来的壮丁只好补充了保安团的逃亡，“志愿兵”的集训也就不得不停止了。这些保安团大部是新兵，一经与人民解放军接触，即四散逃命，新抓的壮丁乘机回家。在解放军声威震慑下，蒋匪的大小地方官吏更是闻风即逃。淮河南北及长江沿岸各县的县长，大都席卷细软逃往九江、汉口等大城市。解放军往往以少数部队，即进占县城，解放经扶县城时，我军仅不过一个排兵力，那些逃命的人给别的城市带去了更大的惊惶，据最近返自九江的商人称：九江市面慌乱，市区入夜戒严，大街小巷，一片死寂。又据汉口来客称：解放军先头部队进抵离汉口仅八十里时，虽在白天，忽传一声“八路军来了”，一时人马纷纷，警笛四鸣，乱成一团。同时在这些城市内及附近各地物价飞涨不已，蒋币变成了废纸，鱼米之乡的九江，虽值新米上市，但米价仍狂涨不已，其他物价莫不飞涨，因此五百以下的蒋币虽在穷乡僻壤也视同废纸，普通商号内部可以看见成捆成堆的蒋币堆在屋角床下，或作为小孩的玩具，或作为引火的燃料，也有妇女把它打成纸背做鞋帮用，最普通的是拿来裱糊房屋，既经济又美观。
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】在蒋匪暗无天日的统治下，蒋军下级官兵家属生活极为悲惨。据北平经世日报上月二十八日载广州通讯称：湖南少妇柳百风，嫁一粤籍军官陆皓生，住于穗（广州）市维新路零里七十七号，今春陆随军走后，其妻即无法维持生活，不久竟被人诱卖入娼门，并被携往他处，陆某奉调返粤归家时，人事全非，经多方打听，几经周折，乃得于娼门与柳氏相见，两人抱头大哭。又蒋军军人龙生之妻杨群风，携子女二人住于穗市的南路，三月前龙生奉调安徽，杨氏亦为生活所困，且又将临产，一筹莫展，遂萌短见，于十八日暗服安眠药四十片自杀，夜半毒发辗转呻吟，被邻居发觉送往医院救治，至十九日始苏醒。其子七岁，女五岁，伏于病榻号哭不止，情状至惨。
