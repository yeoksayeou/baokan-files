Cheshangpu Breaks Through Cadre and Mass Complacency
    Poor and Lower-Middle Peasant Party Members First Calculate Family Assets
    Leading the Whole Village to Consciously Increase Production
    Calculate Small Accounts to Identify Loopholes and Find Patches
    Calculate Big Accounts to Produce More Grain and Dig Up Old Roots

[Report from Zuoquan by this newspaper] Before July 1st this year, Cheshangpu in the Seventh District vigorously launched the production increase and thrift campaign. However, aside from achieving some results, many cadres and masses felt it was just repeating old themes, and there was a sense of "boredom," complacency, and satisfaction with temporary achievements and some good crops. After understanding this situation, the leadership decided to launch a new approach of calculating accounts to fill loopholes, enriching the content of production increase, and transforming the production increase and thrift campaign into "calculating the harvest, calculating family assets, calculating big accounts, calculating small accounts, identifying loopholes and finding patches, and sobering up to continue the struggle." After this slogan was proposed, the masses had no habit of calculating accounts and resisted the idea. Some people said, "Whether we calculate or not, who doesn't know the foundation of whose family? Even if we calculate the loopholes, who will fill them for us?" In light of this situation, dispelling the masses' resistance to calculating accounts became the first hurdle in launching the accounting campaign.

The Branch's Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants First Calculate Accounts to Lead the Masses in Filling Loopholes
To dispel the resistance of some masses to the idea of calculating accounts, the work started with the branch relying on poor peasants. First, calculate the account of defeating Chiang Kai-shek, to inspire the poor and lower-middle peasants to consciously support the front line by digging up roots and increasing production. Then calculate the harvest account, to make everyone sober-minded and stimulate the consciousness of increasing production. After these big and small accounts were calculated clearly, everyone was asked, "Do you have any loopholes?" After each person calculated in detail, they were very surprised and fearful, and said, "We've been muddling along in the dark every day, and didn't feel anything was wrong, but after this calculation, we realized there are some big loopholes!" Seizing the masses' emotions at this time, it was proposed, "Is calculating the loopholes the end, or do we still need to fill them?" Everyone unanimously said, "Calculating is for filling." Further guidance was given to discuss where to fill from. In the discussion, everyone calculated their family assets and thought of ways to fill the loopholes. After everyone calculated their accounts clearly, identified the loopholes, and found the patches, and had a desire to increase production, they were then allowed to persuade the masses, unite the activists, and launch a large-scale accounting campaign.

Inspiring the masses' consciousness of calculating accounts and increasing production also used two methods: calculating big accounts and calculating small accounts. The specific approach was: calculating big accounts to enhance confidence in victory, stimulate the consciousness of supporting the front line by digging up old roots, and dispel negative thoughts and worries. The current domestic situation was briefly introduced, explaining that our army has shifted from gradual counter-offensive preparation to a full-scale counter-offensive. By comparing the actual strength of the enemy and ourselves, and comparing the difficulties of the enemy and ourselves, it was explained that now is an extremely favorable time to eliminate the Chiang army, to enhance everyone's confidence in victory in digging up old roots and inspire everyone's consciousness of supporting the front line and increasing production.

After calculating the big accounts, it was proposed, "Is it better to fight well under extremely favorable conditions now, or not? Who will bear the burden of manpower, material resources, and financial resources consumed during the fight?" to let everyone discuss. After deliberation, everyone's thinking was clear. One liberated peasant said, "After the land reform, the enemy in the family was eliminated, and we have turned over a new leaf at home, but there are still enemies in the courtyard. If we don't eliminate the enemies in the courtyard, it can't be called a complete liberation. Digging up old roots means eliminating the enemies in the courtyard." After everyone had a conscious desire to support the front line, they were guided to discuss how to support. Some said, "Supporting the front line is not just running to the front line to kill the enemy, but also producing more grain in the rear is the same as killing the enemy on the front line." This made everyone's thinking clear and affirmed that supporting the front line in the rear is to produce more grain. After calculating the big accounts, most of the masses' original muddled thinking was also dispelled: they originally thought that: (1) This year is a year of disaster, and the reasonable burden must be reduced; (2) With a large number of troops going south, the burden on our northern side can be reduced.

Calculating Small Accounts, After Understanding Family Assets, Everyone's Eyes Turn Red, and They Voluntarily Find Patches to Fill Loopholes:
Calculating small accounts mainly involves guiding everyone to broaden their horizons and look forward and outward, not just looking at their own village, but also at other disaster areas. After everyone understood the disaster situation, they specifically calculated the harvest and family assets of their own village. Some people were blinded by some good crops and thought it was not a big deal. So the slogans were put forward: "Food to the mouth, grain to the hand!" "Starving to death under the ears of grain!" "Good crops in some areas are still just weeds!" Overcoming the ideas of luck and complacency, it was calculated that the entire village had a net shortage of 432 shi and one dou and six sheng of grain. Each family calculated how big a loophole they had. At this time, the poor and lower-middle peasants took the lead in calculating, which caused everyone to scramble to calculate accounts day and night. After more than two days, each household consciously calculated their loopholes and found their patches, and then summarized the loopholes, family assets, and patching methods by group. Once everyone calculated their accounts, everyone's eyes turned red, and they felt how could such a big loophole be filled? Fearing under the loophole, it was immediately proposed: "Don't be afraid of big loopholes, only be afraid of few patches!" "Lose a thousand, pick up one, calculate everything!" "Patch a little, count a little, gather small things into a whole," everyone had confidence in filling loopholes and understood how to patch.

Democratic Discussion to Formulate Plans, Various Methods to Fill Patches:
In agriculture, after repeated discussions by everyone, it was unanimously proposed that now that the corn and millet have been hoed three times, in order to make the existing crops produce more grain, it was decided to hoe it again, and to plant a large amount of wheat, spring vegetables, and spring barley. Based on the actual experience of the farmers, the slogan was put forward: "Hoe first, then cut, next year it will be easy to plant without saying, at least add three he per mu." In sideline occupations, the slogan was put forward: "Do whatever you can, seize the time and don't miss any opportunity." Everyone formulated methods: transportation, carrying, cutting mountains, weaving furniture, burning charcoal, selling coal, digging medicinal materials, etc.; in textiles, buy three more machines to ensure that the machines are not idle and strive to be self-sufficient in cloth; in savings, it was proposed: "Save on food and clothing to get through the disaster, save food to save lives and fight Chiang."

Launch a Great Competition to Fill Loopholes, Eight Immortals Cross the Sea, Each Showing Their Abilities, Everyone Competing to Get on the Blackboard News, Everyone Racing to Get into the Radio Broadcast:
Family assets are clear, loopholes are seen clearly, patches are found. On August 25th, a meeting of mutual aid team leaders was convened to discuss what to do first. Everyone said: The millet has been hoeed three times, and hoeing the wet ground is not good for the crops. Now is a good time to dig medicinal materials. Everyone unanimously passed a resolution to fully launch a five-day blitz to dig medicinal materials. Some people went up the mountain before dawn. Each group put forward a competition. It officially started on the 26th. By the 30th, a total of four days were spent digging 5,000 catties of Scutellaria baicalensis. During the four days, they all ate early and came back late (taking dry food at noon). The enthusiasm was great. The back was not straight, the hands did not stop, in order to get on the blackboard news and get into the radio to become a new hero in filling loopholes. After all the medicinal materials were dried, they were sold for 120 yuan per catty, which could buy more than 51 shi of grain. After summarizing and evaluating this loophole-filling campaign, on September 1st, the second blitz competition to hoe four times was officially launched. (Lian Qianxiang)

　　车上铺打破干群麻痹思想
  　贫雇党员先算家当
  　带领全村自觉增产
    算小帐认清窟窿找补绽
  　算大帐多打粮食刨老根
    【本报左权讯】七区车上铺今年七一前就响亮的提出了增产节约运动，但干群当中除作了些成绩外，却不少人认为是老生长谈，在思想上都存在着“乏味”，麻痹与满足一时的成绩和部分好庄稼。领导上了解了这样情况后，确定开展算帐补窟窿，充实增产的新内容，变增产节约成“算年成，算家当，算大帐，算小帐，认清窟窿找补绽，清醒头脑再斗争”。这一口号提出后，群众都没有算帐习惯，思想上抵触，有些人这样说：“算不算吧，谁还不知道谁家根底哩，就说算下窟窿吧，谁给咱补哩。”根据这种情况，解除群众对算帐的抵触思想，就成了开展算帐运动的第一关。支部贫雇先算帐带领群众补窟窿解除部分群众对算帐思想抵触，这时就先从支部靠贫农作起，先把打垮蒋介石帐算一下，启发贫雇刨根支援前线增产自觉，再把年成帐算一下，使大家清醒头脑，激起增产自觉。把这大小帐算清后，反问大家“自己有窟窿没有！？”经过各人详细一算，都非常惊奇畏惧，都说：“每天黑摸摸的瞎过，也觉得没个甚，这一算才知道也有个大窟窿哩！”这时抓紧群众的情绪，提出“算出窟窿就完了呢，还是要补哩？”大家一致说“算就是为补。”进一步引导讨论从那里补，讨论中各人计算了自己的家当，想出补窟窿办法。大家算清帐，认清窟窿，找出补绽，有了增产要求后，再让他们去说通群众，团结积极分子，展开大算帐运动。启发群众算帐自觉和增产自觉，也是用了算大帐及算小帐两种办法。具体作法是：算大帐提高胜利信心，激起支援前线刨老根自觉，解除消极思想顾虑。把目前国内情况概括介绍，说明我军已由逐步反攻准备全面反攻，拿实际敌我力量对比，敌我困难对比，说明现在是消灭蒋军极端有利之时，提高大家刨老根的胜利信心，启发大家支援前线和增产自觉。算罢大帐后，提出“现在极端有利条件下打好？还是不打好？打时消耗人力物力财力谁来担”等问题，让大家讨论，经过酝酿，大家思想上都明确了，一个翻身农民说：“土地改革后把家里敌人消灭了，在家中是翻了身啦，可是院里还有敌人，咱们不把院里敌人消灭掉，可不叫大翻身，可天刨老根就是消灭院里敌人。”大家有了支援前线自觉要求后，就引导讨论怎样支援，有的说：“支援前线不光是跑到前线杀敌人，咱在后方多打些粮食也和在前线杀敌人一样。”就此使大家思想上明确肯定：后方支援前线就是多打粮食。经过算大帐，群众原来的糊涂思想也大部解除了：他们原来认为：（一）今年灾荒年，合理负担必然要减轻；（二）部队大量南下，咱北边负担可减轻了。算小帐、清楚家当后，人人眼睛红，自找补绽补窟窿：算小帐主要是引导大家放大眼往前看，往外看，不要光看本村，还要看其他灾区。大家了解了灾情后，就具体的算本村年成、家当，有些人被部分好庄稼朦蔽，认为不打紧。就提出口号：“饭到口，粮到手！”“谷穗底下饿死人！”“部分庄稼好都还是些草！”克服了侥幸麻痹等思想，算出全村净短粮四百三十二石一斗六升，各家算算有多大窟窿？这时贫雇带头先算，引起大家都争先恐后的抢着黑夜白日算帐。经两天多时间，各户都自觉的算下了窟窿，找下了补绽，又按组总结了窟窿家当及补绽办法。大家一经算帐，人人都眼睛红了，感到这样大窟窿可怎样补齐呢？在窟窿底下畏惧，这时即提出：“不怕窟窿大，光怕补绽少！”“丢了一千拾起一，有一算一”，“补了一点算一点，零小集一整”，大家对补窟窿有了信心，懂得了怎样补法。民主讨论订计划，各种办法补补绽：在农业上经过大家反复讨论，一致提出现在玉茭谷锄完三遍，为使现有庄稼多打粮食，决定再锄一遍，大量种麦种春菜春大麦，又根据农民的实际经验，提出口号：“头锄随后割，明年好种不用说，每亩至少加三合”，在副业上提出口号：“得干甚就干甚，抓紧时间不漏空”，大家订出办法：运输、担挑、砍山、编家具、烧木炭、卖煤、刨药材等；纺织上，再买三架机，做到此机不闲，争取穿布自给；在节约上，提出“省吃俭用渡灾荒，省下粮食救生死、打老蒋。”展开补窟窿大竞赛，八仙过海各显能，人人争上黑板报，个个抢进广播筒：家当算明，窟窿看清，找出补绽，八月二十五号召开了互助组长会，讨论先干甚，大家都说：谷已锄过三遍，地湿锄对庄稼不利，这时正好刨药材。大家一致通过，全力开展了五天突击刨药材运动，有些人等不到天明就上山了，各组提出了竞赛。二十六号正式开始，到三十号共刨四天，就刨了黄岑五千斤，四天当中都是起早吃饭，赶黑回来，（晌午带干粮），劲头特大，腰不直，手不停，为的是上黑板报进广播筒，当补窟窿的新英雄。全部药材晒干后，以一百二十元一斤卖出，能买粮食五十一石多。这一补窟窿运动总结评选后，九月一日正式展开第二个补窟窿突击锄四遍大竞赛。（连千祥）
