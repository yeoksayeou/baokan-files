    [This Dispatch from our Hebei-Shandong-Henan Correspondent, 21st] Wang Huayun, Director of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Yellow River Water Conservancy Committee, issued a serious protest against the event of the Chiang bandits instructing the "guerrilla force" of Zhao Zhenting in Kaifeng to breach the Guanmeng River dike on the north bank of the Yellow River, flooding the people of our liberated area, and called on the people of the whole country to offer righteous support. The original telegram is as follows: On the evening of August 17th, during the second major flood season of the Yellow River, the Guanmeng River dike on the north bank of the Yellow River suddenly breached, and the raging flood rushed straight to the Dacheji anti-flood dike near the Yellow River in Changyuan, causing more than sixty villages and towns to be completely submerged, and hundreds of miles of autumn crops were destroyed. Fortunately, our democratic government and local armed forces rushed to the breach site overnight, working with the masses of Quhe, Weinan, Changyuan, and Hua County to repair the breach, preventing a major disaster. According to Wu Qiyun (from Ewan Village, Kaifeng, 28 years old), a soldier from the Second Squad of the Third Platoon of Zhao Zhenting's Kaifeng guerrilla force under Chiang Kai-shek (captured on the spot by our local government), he confessed that when the Yellow River water rose in early August, the local people began to repair the breach. At this time, more than 20 members of the Third Platoon of Zhao Zhenting's Kaifeng guerrilla force under Chiang Kai-shek, led by Li Yuzhen and Zhuge Tong, secretly crossed the Yellow River, drove away the masses, and dug open the Guanmeng dike. Wu Qiyun also confessed the process of breaching the dike under orders, stating: they secretly crossed from the south bank of the Yellow River to Haizhuang on the 17th. That night, they dug open the Guanmeng dike two miles north of the Houshinzhuang market, and the Yellow River water burst through, flowing rapidly. They also notified the Lanfeng and Fengqiu security teams to cover the breach, massacring our representatives from Sanzhangpo and Huanglingji in Quhe Third District who were petitioning to repair the breach, seven people in Yaozhuang (including the entire family of the representative from Yaozhuang were killed), and looted all the property of villagers in the Guantai area. After the breach, the masses of Quhe organized several repairs, but were repelled. Now the witnesses and evidence are all present, and there is no way to hide the truth. Since the surrender of the Japanese invaders, the Chiang bandits have been actively attacking our liberated areas, adopting the so-called "flooding tactic" in an attempt to submerge the people of our liberated areas. Over the past year, for the sake of the safety of the lives and property of millions of people in the liberated areas, our side has always compromised and conceded repeatedly, engaging in several negotiations with the Chiang bandits, but the Chiang bandits have stubbornly gone their own way and blatantly torn up previous "river management agreements." The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) unilaterally assisted Chiang and withdrew its river management personnel. Chiang bandits recently breached the dike near Guantai. The heinous crimes of the Chiang bandits are outrageous. Therefore, this committee hereby issues a serious warning and protest to the Chiang bandits and UNRRA. The Chiang bandits and UNRRA should bear full responsibility for the losses suffered by the lives and property of the people in Quhe and other counties in our liberated area. At the same time, we deeply appeal to all righteous people in the world and to all Chinese compatriots and elders and brothers in the liberated areas to provide strong support to save the affected people in Quhe, Changyuan, Fengqiu, and other counties in Hebei-Shandong-Henan, and unite to oppose the Chiang bandits' atrocities of flooding the liberated areas and UNRRA's crimes of complicity.
    [This Dispatch from our Hebei-Shandong-Henan Correspondent, 21st] The spokesman of the Jin-Hebei-Lu-Yu Military Region Command issued a statement regarding the Chiang bandits' breach of the Guantai dike, flooding more than sixty villages and towns, stating: The vicious plot of the Chiang bandits is unforgivable. In order to protect the lives and property of the people, our army hereby orders all troops in the region to arrest all Chiang Kai-shek bandits who breached the dike and released the water to flood our liberated areas, and bring them to justice without leniency. Even if they escape to the heavens or burrow into the earth, we will track them down and arrest them. The day of the final collapse of the Chiang Kai-shek regime will also be the time when these thugs finally repay their blood debts. We also solemnly declare: If such incidents occur again in the future, the Chiang Kai-shek gang will be held fully responsible, and after the war, they will all be handed over to the people's court for trial.
    [This Dispatch from our Hebei-Shandong-Henan Correspondent, 19th] The fifth rise of the Yellow River has been safely passed under the efforts of our flood prevention personnel along the river. This rise began on the morning of the 15th. On that day, the water level near Liqiao in Pu County rose by one and a half meters. On the morning of the 16th, the floodwaters reached the base of the dike. By noon, it had risen a total of 17 centimeters, and in the afternoon it began to drop. On the 17th, it had returned to the river channel. Note: The water level of this rise exceeded the third and fourth rises, second only to the first and second rises, 5 centimeters lower than the first rise, 4 centimeters lower than the second rise, 5 centimeters higher than the third rise, and 2 centimeters higher than the fourth rise.

    再度抗议蒋匪决堤
    军区训令全区部队严密缉拿决堤蒋匪
    【本报冀鲁豫二十一日电】冀鲁豫黄河水利委员会主任王化云氏，为蒋贼指使其开封“游击队”赵振庭部掘开我黄河北岸贯孟河堤，水淹我解放区人民事件发出严重抗议，并呼吁全国人民正义声援。原电如下：八月十七日晚，黄河第二次大水期中，黄河北岸之贯台河堤突告决口，汹涌洪水，直扑我长垣大车集临黄大堤，致我六十余村镇，全部淹没，百数十里之秋禾，尽毁于水，幸经我民主政府及地方武装星夜赶赴决口地点，协同曲河、卫南、长垣、滑县群众抢堵，未成大患。据当场被我地方政府俘获之蒋记开封游击队赵振庭部第三小队二班战士吴起运（开封鹅湾村人，现年二十八岁）供称：八月上旬黄水上涨时，当地群众即起抢堵，此时开封蒋贼游击队赵振庭部第三小队二十余人由李玉珍、诸葛同带领，偷渡黄河，驱散群众，将贯孟大堤扒开。吴起运并供出其受命扒堤经过称：彼等于十七日由黄河南岸偷渡至海庄，当夜即在后辛庄集北二里处掘开贯孟大堤，黄水遂夺口奔流，彼等并通知兰封、封邱保安队掩护决口，惨杀我曲河三区三丈坡、黄陵集。姚庄请愿堵口代表七人（内姚庄代表全家被杀），并将贯台一带村民财物，全部劫去，而我曲河群众于决口后，曾数次组织抢堵，均被击退，现人证俱在，无可掩饰。查蒋贼自日寇投降以来，即积极进攻我解放区，采取所谓“泛滥战术”，图淹没我解放区人民。一年来，我方为解放区百万人民生命财产之安全，始终委曲求全，一让再让，几与蒋贼交涉谈判，而蒋贼始终一意孤行，悍然撕毁历次“治河协议”。联总片面助蒋，撤退其治河人员。蒋贼近更于贯台附近决堤。蒋贼此种滔天罪行，令人发指，为此本会特向蒋贼及联总提出严重警告与抗议，我解放区曲河等县人民生命财产所受之损失，蒋贼及联总应负完全责任，同时并向全世界正义人士及全中国同胞，各解放区父老兄弟沉痛呼吁，为挽救我冀鲁豫曲河、长垣、封邱等县被难人民，深望予以有力声援，一致起来，反对蒋贼水淹解放区暴行及联总的帮凶罪行。
    【本报冀鲁豫二十一日电】晋冀鲁豫军区司令部发言人，发表谈话，为蒋贼贯台决堤，水淹我六十余村镇称：蒋贼此种毒辣阴谋，实属罪不容诛，本军为保卫人民之生命财产计，特训令我全区部队，对所有以上决堤放水淹我解放区之蒋家匪徒，务必一一缉拿归案法办，决不宽恕，纵使其上天入地，亦必跟踪缉拿；蒋家朝廷最后崩溃之日，亦即此辈暴徒最终偿还其血债之时。并特郑重声明：此后如再有此类事件发生，定由蒋家匪帮负其全责，一俟战争结果，悉交人民法庭审判。
    【本报冀鲁豫十九日电】黄河第五次上涨，在我沿河防泛人员努力防护下，已安全度过。此次涨水于十五日上午开始，是日，濮县李桥一带水位上涨一公尺半，十六日晨大水即偎到大堤根，至午共涨十七公寸，下午即下降，十七日已归河槽。按：此次涨水，水位超过第三、四次，仅次于第一、二次，较第一次低五公寸，较第二次低四公寸，较第三次则高五公寸，较第四次高二公寸。
