[This Newspaper News] The autumn harvest in most villages of the Shahe Sixth District began on the 7th and 8th of this month. To more effectively organize this great autumn harvest and wheat planting campaign, an emergency meeting was held on the 9th, gathering about 300 male and female village cadres and mutual aid team leaders from the entire district for two days. First, the villages held discussions on the organization and leadership of the autumn harvest over the past two days, as well as issues such as wages, equivalent value, and labor and animal power allocation. It was discovered that there were great inconsistencies in labor and animal power wages. For example, cutting millet was calculated in several ways: by the *xiang* [unit of area], by flexibly scoring based on the strength and speed of the labor, by the row, by the *mu* [unit of area], by the piece, or by labor for labor, etc. The wages for women cutting millet varied from five yuan per piece to ten yuan, twenty yuan, or three *liang* of rice. Some livestock was paid by the *xiang*; some paid twelve *jin* of rice for a mule, seven and a half *jin* of rice for a donkey, and five *jin* of rice for an ox; some divided mules, donkeys, and oxen into three grades; some considered one animal equivalent to one person's labor; some considered it equivalent to two people's labor, etc. Therefore, the leadership separately raised the question of how to set wages in order to improve labor efficiency. How should men and women exchange labor and rationally use full and half labor power? How to cultivate deeply and meticulously and expand the wheat field area? How should labor and animal power cooperate so that wheat can be planted in a timely manner? After two days of heated discussion on the issues raised, everyone realized that no matter whether it was a person or livestock, they should do whatever they can do, and it is best to flexibly score and top points according to the speed of the work. It was believed that setting wages too low would not improve labor efficiency. For example, the village chief of Ge Village said, "Our village initially stipulated five *fen* for cutting one millet head." The women said, "Cutting millet for a morning is not as profitable as spinning cotton for a morning." When it was discussed to pay ten yuan for cutting one millet head, the women all rushed to cut it. It was believed that livestock should be rationally divided and converted into equivalent labor, and that all men, women, and children should be mobilized. Li Hongzhi from Xicui Village said, "Li Tong's family in our village is making strong livestock pull crops, harrow stubble, and plow the land, and they are helping with threshing and crushing flax seeds (preparing for basal fertilizer) for the livestock." Li Xueren, the director of the Farmers' Association, said, "Getting through the autumn is a tense matter. We must mobilize and organize women and children. Those who can cut, cut; those who can chop, chop; men transport, harrow, clear stubble, and plow; those who can help, help. Men and women divide labor and do whatever they can." Immediately afterwards, each village announced their autumn harvest and wheat planting plans. Li Xueren from Xicui announced a plan that 1,200 *mu* of wheat would be planted on 1,945 *mu* of land before August 20th, all plowed four fingers deep. All men, women, and military family labor in the village would be mobilized to participate in this autumn harvest and wheat planting, and there would be no compulsion or orders, so as to achieve mutual assistance, equivalent exchange, and no disagreements. As soon as Xueren finished speaking, Shi Jiyun from Nanwang immediately challenged, saying, "Our village has 7,000 *mu* of land and will plant 4,500 *mu* of wheat. We will also meet the conditions of Xicui. If we fail to do so, we will send two glorious banners to Xicui." Xueren immediately responded, "Okay! If our village fails to do so, not only will we send a glorious banner to your Nanwang, but we will also have our village's troupe perform three days of glorious opera for your Nanwang, bringing our own food." With the exception of four villages, a total of twenty-eight villages in the district have joined the competition. An intense autumn harvest and autumn planting campaign is about to unfold throughout the district. (Meng Gao, Zheng Ming)

[This Newspaper Xingtai News] In order to exchange experiences between the new and old districts and to deploy the autumn harvest, Xingtai convened an expanded cadre meeting of the new and old districts. County Chief Wu put forward the key tasks for the coming days: First, seize the opportunity to collect wild vegetables. Before the autumn harvest, the atmosphere should be stirred up and continued through the autumn harvest, and attention should be paid to the preservation of agricultural by-products. Second, seize the autumn harvest. Because of the excessive disasters this year, the autumn harvest is unevenly timed and must be fully organized to achieve seizing, harvesting one piece, threshing one piece, and cultivating one piece, overcoming the contradiction with wheat planting. Third, seize wheat planting: uneven stubble, poor *xiang*, fertilizer and seeds must be prepared in a concentrated way. Cooperatives are responsible for regulating wheat seeds, striving to reduce the incidence of black and yellow jaundice next year. The county's wheat planting target is to reach 70 percent of the cultivated area. (Chang Yan)

　　沙河六区解决等价评工计分
  　竞赛展开秋收秋种
    【本报讯】沙河六区大部村庄秋收已在本月七、八号开始动手收割。为更有力的组织这一秋收种麦大运动，特于九日召开了全区男女三百来个村干部和互助组长的两天紧急会议。首经各村座谈了两天来的秋收组织领导、工资、等价、劳畜配备等问题，发现在劳畜力工资上很不一致。如割谷子有按晌计工、按劳力强弱快慢灵活评分、按垅、按亩、按个计工、工顶工等数种。妇女切谷子有的是切一个五元钱，也有十元、二十元、三两米不等。牲口有的按晌、有的是骡子赚十二斤米、驴赚七斤半米、牛赚五斤米，有是骡、驴、牛各分三等的，有是一个牲口顶一个人工的，有是顶二个人工的，……于是领导上便分别提出究竟怎样订工资，才能提高劳力？男女如何变工和合理的使用全半劳力？怎样深耕细作和扩大麦田面积？劳畜力怎样个配合法，就能种上应时麦子？问题提出后，经两天的热烈讨论，大家认识到不管人、牲口，能干啥就干啥，看作活快慢来灵活评分、顶分最好。认为工资订的太小了提不高劳动效率。如葛村村长说：“俺村先规定切一个谷子五分钱。”妇女说：“切一清早谷子还不如纺一清早花赚钱哩。”当讨论出切一个谷子十元钱时，妇女们就都要抢着去切。认为牲口要合理分工等价折工，要把男女儿童全部动员起来，西崔李洪志说：“俺村李同组人家就是叫硬榜牲口拉庄稼、耙茬子、犁地，替作牲口打场、轧麻仁（准备上底肥）。”农会主任李学仁说：“过秋就是个紧张事，要动员组织妇女、儿童，能割就割，能切就切，男人运的运，耙的耙，＠茬的＠茬，犁地的犁地，搭垧的搭垧。男女分工，够着干啥就干啥。”紧接着各村又各自宣布了秋收种麦计划。西崔李学仁宣布的计划是一千九百四十五亩地要在八月二十前种一千二百亩麦子，都犁四大指深，要把全村男女和各军属劳力动员起来参加这次秋收种麦子，并且还不强迫不命令，作到互助等价交换不起意见。学仁刚落罢话音，南汪石基云马上应战的说：“俺村七千亩地要种四千五百亩麦子，也要作到西崔那些条件，做不到时，送西崔光荣旗两面”。学仁立即应战说，“对！”俺村要作不到，不光给您南汪送面光荣旗，再叫俺村剧团给您南汪贺光荣戏三天，自带上饭食。”全区除四个村外，共有二十八个村卷入竞赛，一个紧张的秋收秋种运动，即将在全区展开。（孟高、政明）
    【本报邢台讯】为交流新老区经验，布置收秋邢台召开新老区扩干会。吴县长提出日前工作，重点是三抓：一抓采野菜，秋收前要把空气掀起来，秋收中贯澈下去，并要注意农业副产品的保存。二抓秋收，因今年灾荒过多，秋收早晚不齐，要全面组织起来，作到抢、收一片、打一片、耕一片，克服和种麦矛盾。三抓种麦：茬不齐、垧不好、肥料种子目前就得突击准备，合作社负责调剂麦种，争取明年少生黑疸黄疸病，全县种麦要求达到耕地面积百分之七十。（昌言）
