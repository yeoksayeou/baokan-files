    Qinshui Zhangma Launches Challenge Competition: Plant and Replant Extensively
    [This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch from the 24th] The Zhang Jiuming Mutual Aid Team in Zhangma Village, Qinshui, planted more than 340 mu of wheat in one day. In late August, the Zhang Jiuming Mutual Aid Team held a meeting to break with the traditional notions of "wheat is sown for three months, harvested all together sooner or later" and "if the ground doesn't freeze by the Beginning of Winter, sow the seeds anyway." They actively organized all able-bodied and semi-able-bodied men and women, and launched challenge competitions between groups and individuals. They rushed to plant wheat and top the plants, and on September 15th, they planted most of the 354.5 mu of wheat in the entire village (except for more than ten mu that were not planted due to rain). They universally plowed and harrowed four times, and applied an average of 60 loads of manure per mu. On the 16th, Zhang Jiuming held another meeting to arrange the autumn harvest, deciding to repair the roads on the 18th and harvest on the 20th, ensuring that military dependents and conscripted soldiers and laborers are given priority. They adopted the method of harvesting one mu when it is ripe and planting one mu after harvesting, extensively replanting wheat fields.
    [This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch from the 24th] The Shangzhong United Brigade, consisting of six villages including Piaoshan, Jide, Huilong, Sannanpo, and Hujia in Yangcheng, mobilized men, women, old and young, to bring all the millet back to the threshing ground in five days. They are now transporting manure and planting wheat. Under the great mobilization and large-scale labor change in the entire village, the creativity of the masses was brought into play. The mutual aid group in Lizhuang, Jide, created a method of dividing work according to tasks: each person harvests 60 jin, earning 3.5 work points; women who cook for one person earn 1 work point. In Qutou Village, women harvested and men carried, so the entire village harvested 1,800 mu of millet in three days. Yunpo adopted a strict division of labor: women, children, and the elderly were responsible for harvesting millet, while able-bodied men were responsible for carrying millet, carrying manure, applying manure, plowing the land, and planting wheat. Old women cooked and took care of the children, and they proposed that the autumn harvest should not hinder autumn plowing, with both progressing simultaneously. Starting from the 14th, in two days, they harvested 718 mu of millet (accounting for one-third of the total) and planted 187 mu of early wheat. Currently, the millet in all six villages of the United Brigade has been completely harvested, and they are actively plowing the land, transporting manure, and planting wheat. They are also learning from the experience of Sannanpo's bumper wheat harvest this year, striving to plow three times, apply more manure, and plant early and abundantly.
    [This newspaper's Xiangyuan dispatch] On the 10th of this month, Xiayu Village in the first district convened a meeting of mutual aid team leaders to discuss how to expand wheat fields. Two problems were identified on the spot: one was that there was a shortage of labor, and the other was that there was a lot of rain after the autumn harvest this year, so the autumn crops could not mature early. If the soil was cold, replanting wheat would not yield a harvest next year. After the discovery, a discussion was launched. Old man Chang Weike said: "If there is a shortage of labor, as long as our men, women, old and young are mobilized, we can manage it in a few days. If the autumn crops are not yellow, there is no need to wait for them to be harvested before replanting. The bare corn and hemp fields can be interplanted immediately. There is a lot of autumn rain this year, and the replanted wheat will definitely yield a harvest next year. We must not miss this good opportunity; our team wants to replant 50 mu." Shen Sanyuan said: "What the old man said is very right, so our team will also replant 50 mu." Under their leadership, each team made plans, and the whole village planned to replant 358 mu of wheat. Then, two methods for replanting wheat were discussed: First, for bare corn and hemp fields, use a hoe to deeply loosen the soil between the rows of crops, then dig ridges and apply fertilizer, and apply more hot manure. Second, use one to two sheng more seeds per mu than regular wheat, and mix the seeds with oil and dry them for two or three days. This will make the wheat stalks strong and prevent them from falling over next year, and the yield will be greater. After the discussion, the whole village was very enthusiastic about replanting wheat. After three days of summarizing on the 14th, a total of eight shi, one dou, and one sheng of wheat seeds were mixed with oil, and 121.5 mu of replanted wheat had been sown. The plan is to complete all sowing in another seven days. (Xiangyuan Joint Office)

    沁水张马挑战竞赛
    随收随种大量改茬
    【本报太岳二十四日电】沁水张马村张九铭互助大队一天种麦三百四十多亩。八月下旬，张九铭互助大队开会讨论，打破了“麦种三个月，早晚一齐收”和“立冬地不冻，有籽尽管种”的传统论调，积极组织男女全半劳力，并发动组与组、人与人的挑战竞赛，突击种麦、刹梢，在九月十五日一天内，就把全村三百五十四亩半麦大部种完（其中有十余亩，因下雨未种上），普遍的做到犁耙四遍，平均每亩上粪六十担。十六日张九铭又开会布置秋收，决定十八日修路，二十日割，保证先尽军干属及出征民兵、民夫，采用熟一亩收一亩，收一亩种一亩的方法，大量回拼麦地。
    【本报太岳二十四日电】阳城劳动英雄上中有联合大队、剽山、吉德、回龙、三南坡、护驾等六村，男女老少齐动手，五天内把谷完全割回场上，现正运粪种麦。在全村大动员大变工之下，发扬了群众的创造性。吉德李庄的互助组，创造了按活计分方法：每人割六十斤，顶三分五工；妇女做一口人的饭，顶一分工。曲头村女割、男担，所以全村三天内割完一千八百亩谷。耘坡采用了严密的分工：妇女儿童老汉管收谷，男全劳力管担谷、担粪、施粪、犁地、种麦，老太婆做饭看小娃，并提出秋收不妨碍秋耕，双方并进。从十四日起，两天内除割谷七百一十八亩（占全部三分之一），又种了早麦一百八十七亩。现全联合大队六个村的谷，已全部割完，正积极犁地送粪种麦，并接收三南坡今年麦子丰收的经验，作到犁三遍、多上粪、早种多种。
    【本报襄垣讯】一区下峪村于本月十号，召开互助组长会议，讨论如何扩大麦田，当场发现有两个问题：一个是劳力少顾不过来；另一个是今年秋后雨多，秋禾不能早熟，土冷了种上改茬麦明年收不了。经发现后展开讨论，常维科老汉说：“劳力少只要咱男女老少都动员起来，忙几天就能行，秋禾不黄，不用等割了再改茬。光棍玉茭地和大麻地，马上就能串种，今年秋雨多，明年改茬麦一定收，可不能放了这个良机对我组要改茬五十亩。”申三元说：“老汉说的很对，这样我组也要改茬五十亩。”在他二人带头下，各组都订了计划，全村共要改茬麦子三五八亩。接着又讨论了改茬麦的两点办法：一、光棍玉茭大麻地种，先用锄把田禾行里深动一遍，然后刨上圪道用圊，并多上热性粪。二、每亩籽比正茬麦多一升至二升，并用油把籽拌起来，晒上两三天，这样能使麦秆壮实，明年不至跌倒，收量也大。经讨论，全村改茬麦劲头很大。十四日做了三天总结，共用油拌麦籽八石一斗一升，已下种改在麦一百二十一亩五分，计划再用七天全部种完。（襄垣联合办公室）
