Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, September 11th: The Chiang government is following in the footsteps of the Greek royalist government, exchanging acceptance of American supervision for American military and economic assistance under the guise of "relief" after the UNRRA ends. According to a Central News Agency dispatch from Washington on September 8th, the US Congress passed a $350 million bill in May regarding American foreign relief after the UNRRA ends (meaning aid to reactionaries in various countries against the people) to "relieve" Austria, Italy, Greece, and China. The Chinese (referring to Chiang) and American sides have reached an agreement on the general principles for the disposition and distribution of relief materials. These principles are the same as those accepted by Greece and other countries, namely, "the distribution of relief materials shall be subject to direct supervision and control by the United States under the terms of the agreement. The United States will send delegations to the relief-receiving countries. The delegation will be subordinate to the American embassy, and its task is to supervise and inspect the reports of the respective countries and to travel around to inspect how the terms of the agreement are implemented." At the same time, the dispatch shows that so-called "relief" materials can be used for non-relief purposes. It is said that "in some cases, relief materials can also be sold." According to a Central News Agency dispatch from Nanjing, the Chiang government's Executive Yuan passed a resolution on the 8th to establish a "Post-War Rehabilitation and Relief Committee" after the UNRRA's operations end. In addition to representatives of the Chiang government, the committee will also include "personnel recommended by the UNRRA or UN agencies." Dong Xian Guang, director of the Chiang government's Information Bureau, expressed his elation that the Chiang government's enthusiasm for selling out the country far exceeded that of Greece, saying: "This is not only an expression of our (referring to the Chiang regime) government's emphasis on the unfinished plans of the UNRRA, but also a new method of international 'cooperation,' which is initiated by our government and is not available to other countries receiving UNRRA materials."

　　蒋介石步希腊反动政府后尘
  　接受美国监督“救济”
    【新华社陕北十一日电】蒋政府正步希腊保皇派政府之后尘，以接受美国监督为条件，换得在联总结束后美国在“救济”名义下对其内战军事及经济之援助。据中央社华盛顿八日专电称：关于联总结束后的美国对外救济（意即援助各国反动派反对人民），美国会已于五月间通过三亿五千万美元法案，以“救济”奥国、意大利、希腊及中国。中（指蒋）美两方对救济物资之处置与分配，已就一般原则获致协议，此项原则，与希腊等国所接受者相同，即“救济物资之分配，应在协定条文之下受美国之直接监督与管制。美国将派遣代表团至接受救济各国，该团隶属美国大使馆，其任务在监督及视察各该国之报告，并遍历各地以视察协定条文如何执行。”同时，该电讯显示所谓“救济”物资尽可用于非救济用途。据称：“在若干情况下，救济物资并可出卖。”又据中央社南京电，蒋政府行政院已于八日通过在联总行总结束后设立“善后事业委员会”，其成份除蒋政府代表外，还有“联总或联合国所辖机构所推荐之人士”参加。蒋政府新闻局长董显光对蒋政府卖国之积极性远超过希腊而表示洋洋得意，他说：“此不仅为我国（指蒋记）政府重视联总未完成计划之表示，且亦为国际‘合作’之新办法，由我国政府自动倡导，而为接受联总物资其他国家所无。”
