　　Reaping Mature Heads of Grain to Prevent Germination and Mold
  　Dongguan Village Transforms into a Labor Team
  　Rush Harvest Sorghum
    [Reported by this Newspaper] Two-thirds of the alkaline land in Dongguan Village, Third District, is planted with sorghum due to fears of flooding and drifting. When the sorghum just began to grow, the leaves were immediately stripped clean to prevent the wind and water from breaking and bending them, thereby reducing the harvest. Now, most of the sorghum is ripe, but continuous autumn rains in recent days have caused some heads to germinate and others to become moldy. The masses were anxious and at a loss. Li Peiwei, the director of the Farmers' Association, convened a meeting of mass cadres to discuss harvesting methods: Mobilize the entire village to implement labor exchange, with Farmer Association members guaranteeing that there will be no overripe sorghum in the fields, women members sun-drying it at home, and children's corps delivering water, food, and pulling carts for transportation, with clear division of labor. Each group also implemented challenges. In a day and a half, they cut all the sorghum planted in the village once over. Their slogan is: "Reap a mature head, cut it, and bring it home to count as grain. No moldy heads, no germination. Cut and plow immediately (using ＠ plows), to plant wheat well." They are currently continuing to harvest. (Qinghe Small Newspaper)

　　熟一穗剪一穗防止生芽发霉
  　东关全村变工
  　急忙抢收高粱
    【本报讯】三区东关村三分之二碱河地，因怕水淹河漂，故多种高粱。高粱刚莠齐时，即连将叶子劈净，以免风吹水冲折倒，减少收成。现在高粱多半已熟，近几日秋雨连绵，有的穗子生芽，有的发霉。群众急忙无着，农会主任李佩伟便召开群众干部会，讨论收秋办法：全村动员实行变工，农会员保证地里没有熟过了的高粱，妇会员在家里摊晒，儿童团送水、送饭、拉车子运输等，明确分工，各组并实行挑战，一天半的工夫，把全村所种的高粱剪完一遍，他们的口号是：“熟一穗剪一穗，收到家里来算粮食，不霉一穗不生一芽，连剪连倒（用＠刨秫），好种麦子。”现正继续收割。（清河小报）
