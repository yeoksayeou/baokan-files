　　Xing County and other places peasants resolutely tracked down the transformed landlords, thoroughly investigating and squeezing out feudalism. In the great storm of land reform, one of the characteristics of the current trend of the landlord class in Jin Sui is that it has changed from the initial "enlightenment" and "land dedication" to disguise and try to dig "air-raid shelters." Zhang Wenhua, a landlord in Nianzi Village, Xing County, requested to return home from military service last year, but recently, with a progressive face, he requested to return to the team, saying, "I will not go home until Chiang Kai-shek is eliminated." Landlord Wang Zengxiang sneaked into a private primary school as a teacher, forbidding students from reading newspapers and often beating poor students. Duan Er, a landlord in Dongxiu Village, Wuzhai County, pretended to be left-leaning and attempted to kill a liquidation target with an iron fork to win the trust of the masses. Zhao Guiji, a landlord in Hugouer Village, Shenchi, pretended to commit suicide by jumping into a well when the masses were settling accounts with him. His whole family wore mourning clothes and prepared a coffin and set up an altar. The village cadres and the masses opened the coffin lid and saw that it was filled with heavy stones. Zhang Haiquan, the son of Zhang Shiqing, the three major tyrant landlords of Hexi Village, Jiaocheng, cried poverty and acted pitifully whenever he saw people: "The family is ruined, have pity on us, grandpas!" Some well-meaning masses mistakenly thought he was a "big nangzi" (meaning someone with no future). During the in-depth liquidation, a large amount of property was found in Zhang Haiquan's home, and a "bottom account book" was found. The account book clearly listed, day by day, how much rent was reduced, how much was liquidated, who divided his things, and he also fabricated a batch of false accounts, ready to extort arbitrarily when there was an opportunity to settle accounts. The "big nangzi" was originally a "poison nangzi". After the various conspiracies of the transformed landlords were exposed in various places, the masses' class vigilance has now been further enhanced, and they are continuing to investigate in depth.

　　兴县地主伪装“左倾”群众识破跟踪追查
    【新华社晋绥九日电】兴县等地农民，坚决追踪化形地主，彻底查挤封建。在土地改革的大风暴中，晋绥地主阶级目前动向的特点之一，是由初期的“开明”、“献地”，转而改头换面极力钻挖“风雨窑。”兴县碾子村地主张文华，去年要求退伍回了家，最近却以进步面目，请求归队，口口声声说：“不消灭蒋介石不回家。”地主王增祥混进民办小学当教员，不准学生看报，并时常毒打贫苦学生。五寨县东秀庄地主段二，假装左倾，企图用铁叉打死清算对象，博取群众的的信任。神池壶狗儿村地主赵贵基，在群众向他倒算时，伪装投井自杀，全家大小都披麻带孝，备棺设灵，村干部和群众将棺盖揭开一看，里面装的却是一堆沉重的顽石。交城河西庄三大霸王地主张士清的儿子海全，见人就哭穷装酸：“家里弄干了，爷爷们可怜可怜吧！”部分好心群众就误认他是个“大囊子”（没出息之意）。在深入清算中，从张海全家里发现了一大宗财物，并找出一本“底把帐”，帐上日月分明，一笔一笔，开列着减租多少，被清算了多少，谁家分了他什么东西，还捏造了一批假帐，准备将有机会倒算时可任意讹诈，“大囊子”原来是个“毒囊子”。各地揭露化形地主的各种阴谋后，群众的阶级警惕现已更形提高，继续深入追查中。
