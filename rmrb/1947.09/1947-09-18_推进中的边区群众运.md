    Southern Hebei is actively preparing for a comprehensive review throughout the region. Several counties have already begun. The First Prefectural Committee and the First Administrative Office have jointly organized a work team to assist Yongzhi in the review.

    Summarizing the Past Year of Land Reform, Emphasis is Placed on Overcoming Complacency

    The preparation for the comprehensive review began with summarizing the past year of land reform. The Second Prefectural Committee emphasized overcoming right-leaning complacency in its summary, and made self-criticisms regarding the tendency to prioritize landlords, not listen to the opinions of the masses, severely suppress special agents, and overestimate achievements. It pointed out that the root cause was a lack of deep understanding of the suffering of poor peasants, a failure to recognize the reactionary nature of landlords, ignorance of the fact that the more landlords are taken care of, the more they will counterattack, as well as blind impatience, replacing the whole with the partial, and making hasty summaries based on inaccurate figures. Counties such as Wucheng also criticized right-leaning thought based on investigations comparing the property of landlords and poor peasants.

    Investigate Ideology, Investigate Class, Correct Cadre Standpoints

    Investigating ideology and investigating class is another aspect of the preparatory work. The Second Prefectural Committee called on all party members to participate in the movement to investigate class and ideology and to take a firm stand during its summary. Counties such as Daming, Enxian, Yongnian, and Gucheng convened county-wide cadre meetings. Some cadres from landlord families reflected on their failure to thoroughly betray their original class, their frowning faces at every struggle, and even their passive resistance to land reform. In the preparation for this review, some even worried that their families would be struggled against in the future, leading to unstable emotions. Some cadres from petty-bourgeois families criticized their past fear of excessive struggle, their vulnerability to the softening and feigned poverty of landlords, their discomfort with the masses' revenge against landlords, and their feeling that it was "almost enough" after each climax of the movement.

    As a key part of the preparation, investigation and research are also underway in various places. The Secretary of the Third Prefectural Committee personally led an investigation and research team to Jize, combining with local cadres and current work, directly checking household by household, having extensive and in-depth talks with the masses, and letting the masses criticize cadres at all levels and policies, in order to study problems. After investigation, Gucheng found that 30,000 poor peasants still lacked land. In Qinghe, landlords still had more than three mu of land per person, while poor peasants had only about two mu, and the destitute only 1.8 mu. The situation in Wucheng was roughly the same as in Qinghe. These investigations powerfully criticized past right-leaning thought.

    Counties such as Linzhang, Ningnan, Qinghe, and Wuxun have begun village-level preparatory work by conducting large-scale training for hired and poor peasants, Party members of hired and poor peasant backgrounds, and village cadres. Linzhang has trained more than 3,000 people in various districts, while Wuxun has trained more than 10,000. The general method adopted in various places is to recount suffering and settle accounts, study class divisions in detail, examine standpoints, review past work, and discuss specific future actions in order to directly enter the comprehensive review. In the Jia Zhuang and Ma Tun sub-districts of Wuxun's eighth district, more than 3,000 male and female peasants aged fifteen to fifty were trained. On the spot, the entire "representative" of Jia Zhuang sub-district and the fake peasant associations of several villages, which were obstructing the mass movement, were disbanded, and village cadres were re-elected. Subsequently, a five-way comparison movement was launched, comparing "who contributed more labor, who ate more steamed buns and meat, who ate more wild vegetable bran cakes," etc. During group discussions, everyone compared themselves, compared others, and used their own pain to elicit the pain of others. The leaders collected the most tragic examples and used them for enlightenment at the general meeting. In the seventeen villages of Ma Tun sub-district alone, 948 cases of human lives were recounted. In the twelve villages of Jia Zhuang sub-district, 246 cases of human lives were recounted, totaling 1,184 lives. From this debt of blood, it was revealed that the landlords had all colluded with the Japanese invaders and traitors, and that the big landlords and evil despots were almost all heads of traitors, special agents, and puppet soldiers. They had caused the great famine of 1932, forcing our parents, wives, and children to die or flee. This aroused deep class hatred.

    　　　★　　　　　　　★　　　　　　★　　　　　　　★

    The land reform in the Hebei-Luyu area in August had two important developments. One was the emphasis on the policy of relying on poor peasants and uniting with middle peasants, based on long-term experience. The other was the proposal, based on new experiences in Boping and other places, to universally launch a movement of contributing thoughts, self-reporting, unity, and accusations, moving the review forward.

    Poor Peasant Backbone Unites with Middle Peasants to Self-Report, Unite, and Accuse Landlords

    Due to different attitudes towards poor peasants, there were two different working methods in various places. One was to establish separate poor peasant organizations, establish poor peasant leadership, and unite with middle peasants. Regions that did this were able to fully mobilize the masses, thoroughly destroy the landlord class, and implement the policy of filling gaps and making up deficits in distribution. The other was to rely on middle peasants to "lead the poor peasants," so they could not be "ruthless" towards the landlords, resulting in the "almost enough" mentality and implementing the distribution method of the rich peasant line. Even if they initially implemented the distribution method of more for the poor and less for the rich, after one, two, or three or four distributions, they would not calculate according to the original composition, and even distribute equally.

    The Hebei-Luyu Daily editorial severely criticized the latter working method, believing that it was fundamentally due to insufficient attention to and contact with poor peasants, failure to understand the suffering of poor peasants, and failure to listen to their voices. Secondly, it was equating middle and poor peasants, daring not to establish independent poor peasant organizations, establish poor peasant backbones, and adhere to filling gaps and making up deficits, fearing that this would harm the unity of middle and poor peasants. But on the contrary, this would neither thoroughly destroy feudalism nor fully meet the demands of poor peasants. The poor peasants would leave us, and the middle peasants would gradually become depressed due to the lack of backbone. In addition, there was a "good person" viewpoint that lost its position, hindering the establishment of poor peasant leadership backbone. The editorial pointed out that without resolving the above ideas, the review could not be implemented.

    On the Issue of Middle Peasant Old Village Cadres and Branch Leadership and Poor Peasant Leadership

    In establishing poor peasant backbone, there are two specific issues worth noting. One is the relationship between middle peasant old village cadres and branch leaders and poor peasant leadership. In the past, Fan County, although it had established poor peasant groups, still held power in the hands of the old village cadres. The poor peasants were only tools used during the struggle. The leadership dared not resolutely remove or transfer old village cadres who had been consistently detached from the masses, were not active in the struggle, and did not change after education. After inspection, it was proposed that establishing poor peasant backbone meant supporting poor peasants in establishing their own leadership. Old village cadres who repeatedly refused to implement the opinions of poor peasants after education would be resolutely removed. In the combination of branch leadership and poor peasant leadership, because the composition of the branch leadership had not been better reformed in the land reform, their opinions were often far from the poor peasants; therefore, Fan County determined that each task should first be discussed among the poor peasants, and the branch could clarify the opinions of the poor peasants and arrange for the whole party to guarantee their implementation. This is the mass line of branch leadership coming from the masses and going to the masses. If there is resistance to the opinions of poor peasants in the branch, ideological struggle can be carried out. The other is the issue of class division. Some villages in Qingfeng only divided landlords and rich peasants, and did not clearly divide middle and poor peasants. There were still "two-headed" elements among the poor peasants, and there were also bankrupt landlords and rich peasants among the middle peasants. The composition of the peasant association was complex, and the opinions of the poor peasants could not be implemented. After inspection, it was determined to clearly divide middle and poor peasants, and to squeeze landlords, rich peasants, and bad elements out of the middle and poor peasants. The method of division was to compare poverty. In comparing poverty, they naturally recounted their suffering, which not only clarified everyone's face but also deepened their hatred for the landlords, ensuring the purity of the poor peasant organization.

    The Hebei-Luyu leadership believes that the development of the movement to contribute thoughts, self-report, unite, and accuse has solved important problems in the review movement and opened up a new situation for the review movement. The reason why this movement is emphasized is based on the following situation, that is, when landlords used various methods to disintegrate the peasant camp and create air-raid shelters, some leaders in some areas complained about cadres and honest peasants, and attacked them out of complaint. However, Shou Zhang, Bo Ping, and other places affirmed that all sins belong to the landlords and rescued cadres and masses who were trapped by the landlords. At the Second Prefectural Committee activists meeting and subsequent county and district meetings, the landlords' conspiracies and the cadres' personal attitudes were repeatedly studied, and a movement to contribute thoughts was launched. Bo Ping specifically studied the pain and feelings of the honest peasants who served as air-raid shelters, affirmed their demand for emancipation, analyzed their "fear of both sides" thinking, and called for the development of a self-reporting movement. When they self-reported, they naturally accused the landlords of harming them, thereby more resolutely opposing the landlords and producing a large number of new activists. Based on this situation, the Hebei-Luyu leadership proposed that establishing poor peasant backbone is to mobilize all the poor peasant layers to become activists in the movement, rather than mobilizing one or two poor peasants, pressing them to the leading organ, or simply dividing the poor peasant organization. It requires all localities not to be satisfied with the emergence of a few cadres of poor peasant origin, but to fully mobilize the poor peasant layer.

    　　　★　　　　　　　★　　　　　　★　　　　　　　　★

    The land reform in the new Jinan area has undergone a great change in August.

    Mass Work Conference Clears Commandism, Mass Movements in Various Places Have Undergone Great Changes in the Past Month

    Since its liberation, Jinan's leadership has vigorously promoted land reform. All cadres, not shying away from hardship, led the peasants in struggles such as anti-"village compilation" and achieved considerable success. However, due to unclear ideology, a simple division of land was formed, and the masses were not fully mobilized, which affected the movement. The Prefectural Committee Mass Work Conference held in mid-July made a strict review, which became the beginning of the transformation of Jinan's mass movement. This conference focused on clearing commandism and the concept of giving grace. Before this, many comrades emphasized top-down working methods, downplaying bottom-up methods, believing that recounting suffering was based on the experience of the in-depth period of the early and late stages and did not conform to the new area situation. Thus, they replaced the masses' consciousness with orders. In the steps of the struggle, they emphasized one struggle and one land division, "one pot end," opposing gradual in-depth struggles according to the masses' demands, in order to completely eliminate feudalism. Its most significant form was solving problems in the Three District Assembly: first, a top-down ideological mobilization meeting, then a struggle meeting, and then a result-receiving meeting. On the issue of uniting more than 90% of the masses, they advocated "one sound," that is, the top shouted, "Let's do this!" and the bottom responded, "Yes!" In fact, they used the minority to force the majority. The Mass Work Conference criticized the above deviations, and in the past month or so, the movement has greatly changed, and some have even moved towards a climax.

    According to Li Zhimin, Deputy Secretary of the Third Prefectural Committee of Jinan, the Jinan movement in the past month or so can be divided into four types. The practices of Yongji and Ronghe are: after a breakthrough in a base point in one or two districts, they used this as a basis to convene a poverty alleviation meeting in the entire district to promote comprehensive action. For example, in the 113 natural villages in Yongji's Third District, after breaking through ten villages first, they used their activists to prepare for a meeting of hired and poor peasants in the entire district. A total of more than 1,200 people came from various villages. Within ten days after the meeting, 95 natural villages liquidated 219 households of landlords and despots. In the five counties of Yishi, Wanquan, Anyi, Linjin, and Jishan, 40 to 50 villages are currently involved in the struggle. As the struggle gradually deepened, incidents of landlords colluding with special agents to massacre peasants continued to occur in the three counties of Yishi, Wanquan, and Linjin. Lu Changxu, the peasant leader of Lixi Village in Yishi, and Xue Anqing, an activist of Siwang Village in Wanquan, were killed. Yishi's First District held a memorial meeting of 5,000 people for the death of Lu Changxu, giving redoubled revenge to the counterattacking landlords and executing two armed special agents. The Wanquan County Peasant Association is also preparing a public memorial for the deceased peasants. The villages in Yishi's Third District have organized armed forces to launch a land struggle against the landlords. After Xue Anqing and others were killed in Siwang Village, Wanquan, they formed an emancipation armed force and repelled two attacks by special agents on activists. Wenxi, Xiaxian, Pinglu, and Xinjiang turned around quickly after the Mass Work Conference because they took detours in the previous struggle by simply dividing the land. Currently, fires have been lit everywhere. The situation in Ruicheng, Yuxiang, Jiexian, and Hejin is different. Due to enemy disturbances and the late dispatch of cadres, the movement in Yuxiang and Ruicheng is developing slowly; however, by August 15, each had broken through more than 20 villages. The movement in Hejin has only begun locally.

    　　　　　★　　　　　　　　★　　　　　　　　　★

    The Taixing District Party Committee Office has made a systematic summary of the new district mass movement experience in Taixing in its August bulletin. Here are only a few materials from the second movement in the stage of great development, proposing the experience of peasant associations investigating class for local reference. The purpose of the peasant association's investigation of class is to truly establish a poor peasant leadership backbone, pursue feudalism after the first large-scale movement, and raise the movement to a new level. Because in the first movement, due to the limitations of various conditions of the movement itself, a considerable number of landlords, special agents, and bad eggs were mixed into the peasant association, making the first movement only stay at a certain stage and stagnate. Due to the existence of bad eggs, only they "jumped around" when things happened. Although a few hired and poor people were cadres, they were also suppressed and could not lift their heads. Their leadership was formal. (Tangyin and Qixian both had this situation.)

    New District Peasant Association Investigates Class, Clears Bad Eggs, and Rectifies Lineup

    After three months of movement, Tangyin's Fifth District still had many small landlords and feudal rich peasants who had not been struggled against, and the evil despots who had been struggled against were not thorough enough. The main reason was that bad eggs had mixed into the peasant association. According to the materials from Tangyin and other counties, the mixing of bad eggs into the peasant association is a common phenomenon in the new district. More than 70 people were mixed into a large group in Chengdongguan, Pingding. At the beginning of the movement in Xiaoyangou, Qixian, the main cadres such as the militia captain, instructor, and director of the peasant association were all people who had done things for the returnees. Therefore, after a period of movement, the peasant association's investigation of class became the demand of the masses. When the movement first started, the masses still had concerns about this, but after confronting the landlords, they demanded that their own camp be strictly rectified in order to prepare for continued attacks. In fact, the movement has been improved in all areas that have met this requirement of the masses. Tang (Yin) Dong began the second movement of macro scale from the peasant association's investigation of class, and recovered 150,000 mu of land.

    The role of the peasant association's investigation of class has four aspects: (1) eliminating bad eggs; (2) poor peasants truly seize power; (3) encouraging peasant association members; (4) striving for protection households, so that landlords are completely isolated. In practice, it mostly starts from talking about history and dividing classes. The Boai Baishan Village, for example, had a large gathering of peasant association members, who were passed by everyone one by one. At the beginning, everyone did not dare to express their opinions. The approach was immediately changed. All those who wished to join the peasant association stood in rows of ten people each, and faced each other in small groups for review. The villagers knew the details, and those who met the conditions were all passed. When Liu Sixi signed up, there was a roar and the whole audience shouted, "He is a broken rich man, no!" High interest lenders, puppet chiefs, etc. were all cleared. After the members were reviewed, the cadres lined up and let the masses approve them one by one. If they were satisfied, they clapped and passed. If there were objections, they were raised face to face: "Qu Lianquan's roots are not right, he is a broken rich man, he doesn't know the difficulties of the poor, let him rest." "Li Chunfang is irresponsible. When the enemy came, he didn't lead us to fight guerrillas, so he can't be a cadre." In this way, even Village Deputy Wang Lisheng had three cadres removed. Cadres with shortcomings were more cautious after this review.

    From the development of the new district movement, it can be seen that establishing hired and poor leadership must be firmly grasped in every link of the movement. At the beginning of the movement, training hired and poor peasants is a good way, and therefore becomes one of the important factors in quickly opening up the situation. When after a period of movement, the peasant association investigates class and truly establishes the leadership of hired and poor, it becomes an important link to improve the movement and pursue the landlord.

    (Editor's note: This article also has a section on checking feudalism and ideology in government agencies, troops, and factories, which will be disclosed later.)

　　推进中的边区群众运
    晋冀鲁豫总分社
    按本文是根据总分社现有一些材料写成，难免不够全面，希读者见谅。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    冀南积极准备全区大复查，若干县份并已开始，一地委、一专署特联合组织工作团，派赴永智协助复查。
    总结过去一年土改强调提出克服自满
    大复查的准备，从总结过去一年的土地改革开始。二地委总结中强调提出克服右倾自满，对先照顾地主、未听取群众意见严厉镇压特务、过高估计成绩等偏向，作了自我批评。并指出其根源在于对贫农痛苦体会不深，不认识地主的反动性，不知地主越照顾便越反攻，以及盲目的操之过急，以局部代替全体，根据不精确的数字，草率的作了总结。武城等县亦根据调查，对比了地主与贫农的财产，批评了右倾思想。
    查思想查阶级端正干部立场
    查思想查阶级是准备工作的另一内容。二地委于总结时号召全体党员投入查阶级查思想运动，严正立场。大名、恩县、永年、故城等县均召开了全县干部大会，若干地主出身的干部反省了未彻底叛变原阶级，每次斗争都是愁眉苦脸，甚至消极抵抗土地改革，而在这次复查准备中，有的还担心将来会斗了自己家庭，情绪不稳。若干小资产阶级出身的干部批判了过去怕斗争过火，经不起地主的软化与装穷，看不惯群众对地主的报复，有怜悯思想，致每逢运动高潮过后，即感到“差不多”。
    作为准备工作重要内容之一的调查研究工作，各地亦正进行。三地委书记亲率调查研究组赴鸡泽，结合当地干部、当前工作，直接挨户检查，与群众广泛深谈，让群众批评各级干部及政策，从中研究问题。故城经过调查，发现三万贫农尚缺土地。清河地主每人仍有三亩以上土地，贫农每人却只二亩左右，赤贫则仅一亩八分。武城情况亦与清河大致相同。这些调查，均有力的批判了过去的右倾思想。
    临漳、宁南、清河、武训等县，以大规模集训雇贫农，雇贫成份党员，村干部，开始了村级的准备工作。临漳各区已集训三千多人，武训则已集训万人以上。各地采用的方法，一般是诉苦算帐，详研阶级划分，检查立场，检查过去工作，并讨论今后具体作法，以便直接进入大复查。武训八区的贾庄、马屯两小区，集训了从十五岁到五十岁的三千余男女农民，当场解散了阻碍群运的贾庄小区全体“代表”和几个村的假农会，重选了村干部。遂即展开比比“谁出的劳力多，谁吃的馍馍和酒肉，谁吃的野菜糠窝窝”等五比运动。分组酝酿中，各人用自己比，引别人比，用自己的痛，引别人的痛，领导上把最惨痛的例子集中起来，作大会启发，仅马屯小区十七个村就诉出九百四十八条人命案子，贾庄小区十二个村诉出二百四十六条人命，共一千一百八十四条人命。从这笔血债中，比出地主都曾与日寇汉奸勾结，大地主与恶霸地主差不多都是汉奸特务伪军头子，是他们造成了三十二年的大灾荒，逼使我们父母妻子死亡逃散。从此引起了深刻的阶级仇恨。
    　　　★　　　　　　　★　　　　　　★　　　　　　　★
    冀鲁豫八月份的土地改革，有两个重要的发展。一是根据长时间的经验，强调的提出了依靠贫农联合中农的方针，一是根据博平等地的新经验，提出普遍开展献思想自报团结控诉运动，把复查向前推进了一步。
    贫农骨干联合中农自报团结控诉地主
    由于对贫农的态度不同，各地存在着两种工作方法。一种是建立单独的贫农组织，树立贫农领导，联合中农，凡是这样做的地区，就能充分发动群众，彻底摧毁地主阶级，贯澈填平补齐的分配政策。一种是依靠中农“领导贫农”，因此对地主“狠”不下去，就产生“差不多”思想，就实行了富农路线的分配方法。即便开始时也实行了贫多富少的分配方法，但分过一两次或三、四次后，就不按原成份计算，甚至平均主义的分配了。
    冀鲁豫日报社论严正的批判了后一种工作方法，认为这基本的是因为重视与接近贫农不够，不了解贫农痛苦，不倾听他们的呼声。其次是把中贫农等同起来，不敢建立贫农独立组织、树立贫农骨干、坚持填平补齐，怕这样做伤害了中贫农团结；但恰恰相反，这样既不能彻底摧垮封建，又不能充分满足贫农要求，贫农就会离开我们，中农也会因没有骨干而逐渐消沉。另外，有一种失掉立场的“好人”观点，障碍着树立贫农领导骨干。社论指出：不解决上述思想，复查就不能贯澈。
    对中农老村干和支部与贫农领导问题
    在树立贫农骨干中，还有两个具体问题值得注意。一是中农老村干以及支干领导与贫农领导的关系问题。范县过去虽建立了贫农组，但大权仍握在老村干手中，贫农只是斗争时被利用的工具。领导上对一贯脱离群众，斗争不积极，经教育不改的老村干，不敢坚决的撤职或调训。后经检查，提出树立贫农骨干，就是扶持贫农树立自己的领导，老村干如屡经教育，仍不执行贫农意见者，坚决撤职。在支干领导与贫农领导的结合上，因支部领导成份，未在土地改革中求得更好改选，其意见往往与贫农的距离甚远；因此，范县确定：每个工作应先在贫农中酝酿，支部可把贫农的意见加以明确，布置全党保证实现。这就是支部领导从群众中来到群众中去的群众路线。支部中如有抵抗贫农意见的，可开展思想斗争。另一个是划阶级问题。清丰有的村因为只划分了地主、富农，没把中贫农划清，贫农中尚有“两头赶上”的分子，中农里面也有破落地主、富农，农会组织成份复杂，贫农的意见执行不通。后经检查，确定划清中贫农，并从中贫农中把地主、富农及坏分子挤出去。划分的办法是比穷，比穷中自然的诉起苦来，这既弄清了大家的面貌，又加深了对地主的仇恨，贫农组织获得纯洁的保证。
    献思想自报团结控诉运动的开展，冀鲁豫领导上认为解决了复查运动的重要问题，为复查运动展开了新的局面，这一运动之所以强调提出，是基于下述情况，即当地主用各种方法瓦解农民阵营、制造防空洞时，有些地区的领导上埋怨干部、埋怨老实农民，由埋怨而打击。但寿张、博平等地肯定了一切罪恶归地主，对中了地主圈套的干部、群众予以挽救。在二地委活动分子会以及以后的县、区会议上，均反复的研究了地主阴谋，干部纷纷检查地主的活动以及个人的态度，展开献思想运动。博平特别研究了当防空洞的老实农民的痛苦与心情，肯定他们的翻身要求，分析了他们的“两头怕”思想，号召开展自报运动，当他们自报时，自然进行了对地主陷害自己的控诉。从而与地主更坚决对立起来，涌出大批新的积极分子。根据这一情况，冀鲁豫领导上提出：树立贫农骨干，是为了把贫农层全部发动起来，成为运动中的积极分子，而不是发动一两个贫农，向领导机关一按，或是把贫农组织一划开即可解决的。要求各地不要满足于几个贫农成份干部的出现，要充分发动贫层。
    　　　★　　　　　　　★　　　　　　★　　　　　　　　★
    晋南新区土地改革在八月份中有很大的转变。
    群工会议清算命令主义各地群运月来有大转变
    晋南自解放后，领导上即大力推进土地改革，全体干部，不避艰辛，领导农民进行了反“编村”等斗争，获得不少成绩。但由于思想上的不明确，形成单纯分田，群众未能充分发动，使运动受到影响。七月半召开的地委群工会议，曾作了严格检讨，成为晋南群运转变的开始。这次会议着重的清算了命令主义与恩赐观点。在这以前，不少同志在工作方式上强调自上而下，轻视自下而上，认为诉苦是根据前后期深入时期的经验，不合新区情况。于是以命令代替了群众的自觉。在斗争步骤上，强调一次斗争，一次分田，“一锅端”，反对根据群众要求，逐次深入斗争，以彻底消灭封建。其最显著的形式是三区大会解决问题：先开由上而下的打通思想会，次开斗争会，再开结果实会。在团结百分之九十以上群众的问题上，主张“一声响”，即上面一呼：“这样干吧？”下面一应：“对！”实际上并以少数强制多数。群工会议并上述偏向作了批判，月余来，运动已大为改观，部分并都己走向高潮。
    据晋南三地委副书记李志敏报导，月余来的晋南运动，可分四种类型。永济、荣河的作法是：在一个或两个区的范围内，基点突破后，以此基础，召开全区的扶贫会议，推动全面。如永济三区一百一十三个自然村，首先突破十个，便以其积极分子筹备全区的雇贫会议，各村共到千二百余人，会后十天内有九十五个自然村清算了二百十九户地主奸霸。猗氏、万泉、安邑、临晋、稷山五县，目前均有四五十个村子卷入斗争。由于斗争逐渐深入，猗氏、万泉、临晋三县地主勾结特务残杀农民的事件不断发生，猗氏陆喜营村的农民领袖陆长绪，万泉四望村的积极分子薛安清等已被害，猗氏一区为陆长绪的被害，召开了五千人的追悼大会，予反攻地主以加倍报复，枪决了两个武装特务。万泉县农会亦筹备公祭被难农民。猗氏三区各村纷纷组织武装，与地主展开土地斗争。万泉四望村于薛安清等被害后，组成翻身武装，击退两股特务对积极分子的袭击。闻喜、夏县、平陆、新绛四的前段斗争中因单纯分田走了弯路，群工会议后转变很快，目前已到处点起火来。芮城、虞乡、解县、河津情况各有不同，虞、芮两县由于敌人扰乱，干部派去较迟，运动发展较慢；但至八月十五日已各突破二十余村。河津运动现仅局部开始。
    　　　　　★　　　　　　　　★　　　　　　　　　★
    太行的新区群运经验，太行区党委办公室已于八月通报上作了系统总结。这里只有大发展阶段中的第二次运动中的若干材料，提出农会查阶级这一经验，供各地参考。农会查阶级的目的，在于真正树立贫农领导骨干，继第一次大运动之后，追击封建，把运动提高一步。因为在第一次运动中，由于运动本身各种条件的限制，农会中混入了相当数量的地主、特务坏蛋，使得第一次运动只能停留在一定阶段上，迟滞不前。由于坏蛋的存在，遇事只有他们“蹦跳”，雇贫虽有几人当干部，也被压得抬不起头来，其领导是形式的。（汤阴、淇县均有此种情况。）
    新区农会查阶级清除坏蛋整阵容
    汤阴五区经过三个月运动，仍有许多小地主与封建富农未斗，而斗过的恶霸地主也不彻底，其主因即为农会中混入了坏蛋。根据汤阴等县的材料看，坏蛋混入农会，在新区是一般现象。平定城东关一个大组内即混入七十多人。淇县小岩沟运动之初，民兵队长、指导员、农会主任等主要干部，全是干过还乡几等的人物。因此，经过一段运动之后，农会查阶级就成为群众要求。在运动刚起时，群众对这一层还有顾虑，但和地主交锋之后，便要求严整自己阵营，为继续进攻作准备。事实上，凡是满足了群众这一要求的地区，运动均获得提高。汤（阴）东从农会查阶级开始，展开了宏大规模的二次运动，收回十五万亩土地。
    农会查阶级的作用有四：（一）剔除坏蛋；（二）贫农真正掌权；（三）鼓励农会员；（四）争取包庇户，使地主完全孤立。在作法上，多是从谈历史、划分阶级入手。博爱柏山村则是农会员大集合，一个个经大家通过。开头，大家不敢表示意见，当即转变作法，凡愿入农会者，十人一组站成行列，以小组为单位，面对面的审查。本村人摸底细，够条件者一律通过。当刘思喜报名时，哄然一声全场喊叫：“他是破老财，不中！”对高利贷者、伪保长等均予以清除。会员审查毕，干部排成队，让群众挨个批准，满意的，拍手通过。有意见的当面提出：“璩连全根子不正，是破老财，不知道穷人难，叫他休息吧。”“李春芳不负责任，敌人来时，没领导咱们打游击，不能当干部。”这样，连村副王立盛共审查掉三个干部。有缺点的干部经此次审查更加兢兢业业了。
    从新区运动发展来看，树立雇贫领导，必须在每一运动环节牢牢掌握。运动之初，集训雇贫农是个好办法，因此成为迅速轰开局面的重要因素之一。当经过一段运动之后，农会查阶级，真正树立雇贫领导，便成为提高运动追击地主的重要一环了。
