　　[Hebei-Shandong-Henan, September 10th] In the Hebei-Shandong-Henan plains, sorghum and millet have seen a widespread bumper harvest. According to experienced old farmers, this year's sorghum yield is generally around 200 jin per mu, with the best yields reaching 300 to 350 jin, and millet can also yield 200 to 350 jin, which is unprecedented in recent years. Currently, the autumn harvest is in full swing everywhere. Women and children in various villages are all going to the fields to rush the harvest, and local garrison troops and rear organizations are actively helping the masses with the harvest. In Da Lü Lou, the fourth district of Guan County, men and women, old and young, are mobilized in the autumn harvest mutual aid, and the work speed is more than half as fast as usual. Elderly women, young women, children's groups, and sister groups in the village are organized into four groups according to the distance of their homes. Men go to the fields to cut sorghum, and women go to the fields to cut sorghum ears, cutting and drying them at the same time, and sending the dried sorghum to the field on the same day, and completing the harvest in two days. Children's groups and sister groups turn sweet potato seedlings, then thresh sorghum stubble and bundle sorghum stalks. In the evening, they hold meetings to review the day's work and propose the next day's work. Liangcheng Town, the first district of Shou Zhang, is near the Yellow River. Upon hearing that Chiang Kai-shek had breached the dike at Guantai and flooded our liberated areas, the village cadres, education committee members, and team leaders immediately convened a meeting to discuss the rush harvest. First, they registered the number of mu of autumn crops in each household, totaling 2.3 qing of millet and sorghum. The next day at dawn, they convened a mass meeting of the whole village, deciding that elderly women and sister groups and children's groups would cook, take care of children, and watch the field at home, and the rest would all go to the fields to work, proposing the slogan: "Ensure that not a single ear of millet and sorghum is left behind." On the same day, more than 2.3 qing of crops were harvested. In a village in a certain district of Shou Zhang, after learning the news of Chiang Kai-shek's breach at Guantai, the whole village immediately became tense. Men and women, old and young, immediately divided the work, some repaired the dikes, and some cut sorghum. The people were in the mud and water, being rained on from above and soaked from below, and carried out the rush harvest intensely. Comrade Feng Yuzhen, the company commander of the First Company of the field hospital in the village, and Comrade Chen Chuanyou, the instructor, immediately convened all the members of the company headquarters and said: "We are the people's army, and we must serve the people at all times. Chiang Kai-shek releases water to flood the crops of the people, what should we do?" Everyone said in unison: "Let's go to the fields to help." The staff of the hospital immediately went to the fields to rush the harvest, and cut sorghum heads on a total of 50 mu and hemp on 5 mu in three days. When it rained, the wounded helped the masses stack sorghum, and when the masses returned from the fields, the sorghum had already been stacked, fully demonstrating the spirit of unity and mutual assistance between the army and the people.
