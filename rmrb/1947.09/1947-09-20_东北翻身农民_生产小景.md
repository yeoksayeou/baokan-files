　　Northeast Emancipated Peasants
  　Glimpses of Production
    ◇ In Shangzhi County, Songjiang Province, emancipated peasants are utilizing the time between weeding and the autumn harvest to gather hay for the winter, planning to send 100,000 catties of hay to the soldiers at the front.
    ◇ In Taikang County, Nenjiang Province, more than 4,500 emancipated peasants are gathering hay, each person cutting over 700 catties per day. It is estimated that 70 million catties can be cut before the autumn harvest, worth over 200 million yuan.
    ◇ In Tatou Village, Dong'an County, Hejiang Province, all villagers, men, women, young, and old, are engaged in sideline production, chopping firewood, spinning yarn, and gathering mushrooms. The earnings of each person are enough to exchange for a set of winter clothes.
    ◇ The masses in Shuangcheng are actively investing a portion of the fruits of their struggle into textile cooperatives. The cooperative now owns 1,120 spinning wheels and 15 looms.
    ◇ In the Heihe sub-region, under the premise of ensuring the task of local property self-sufficiency, organs and troops have cultivated over 10,000 hectares of land. All vegetables for the first half of the year were self-sufficient, and it is estimated that 130,000 catties of vegetables can be harvested this autumn, with each person receiving one *shi* of refined grain.
    ◇ In addition to self-sufficient production, various organs in the Heihe sub-region are also assisting the masses in production, mobilizing over 100 head of livestock for plowing assistance, and providing loans of over 17 million yuan and approximately 50,000 catties of grain, promptly resolving the farming difficulties of local peasants.
    ◇ Emancipated peasants in the Durbet Banner, Nenjiang Province, put forward the slogan "Harvest one more grain of rice, eliminate one more enemy," conducting in-depth inspections of labor exchange and mutual assistance, organizing the adjustment of livestock, striving to achieve quick harvesting, quick collection, and quick storage, ensuring that the new grain enters the granary in a timely manner.
    ◇ Various organs, troops, and schools in the rear areas of eastern, western, and northern Manchuria have launched a "sun-dried vegetable" campaign to ensure the winter vegetable supply for the field army at the front. Organs in Qiqihar have put forward the slogan: "One catty of dried vegetables per person to support the front line." Zhaodong County, Songjiang Province, had already sent over 10,000 catties of dried vegetables to the front line by mid-August.
