    Wu'an Deploys Autumn Harvest
    Striving for Half of the Cultivated Land to be Planted with Wheat
    [This paper's Wu'an News] County Head Comrade Zhang Hanlin deployed the autumn harvest, autumn planting, and wheat planting work at a meeting of county cadres on the 15th of this month. The report stated: Due to a prolonged spring drought, planting was completed in eight attempts. The crops are divided into three sowings. The first sowing was before the fifth day of the fifth lunar month, totaling 200,000 mu, with three planting attempts. Harvesting can begin around the 10th of August in the lunar calendar. The second sowing was 450,000 mu, planted after the 10th of the fifth lunar month, and harvesting can begin around the 20th of August. The third sowing was 350,000 mu, planted from the 26th of the fifth lunar month to the beginning of the sixth lunar month, and harvesting will begin in September. In addition, there are 40,000 mu of wasteland that was either not planted or planted late and not weeded. The entire autumn harvest and planting can last for a month. The old liberated area consists of the first and second sowing crops, and wheat planting can be completed by the end of August, all with direct sowing. Labor and animal power are generally not a problem. In the newly liberated area, there are more third sowing crops, and the disaster situation is more serious. Taking Gao Village and Boyan Village as examples, the grain shortage will be three to four months until the autumn harvest next year. Each person must plant three mu of wheat to manage. Therefore, from now on, we must resolve all difficulties and urgently organize the masses to interplant wheat. Fifty percent of the county's cultivated land must be planted with wheat, which is an increase of 20 percent (i.e., 200,000 mu) compared to previous years.

    武安布置收秋
    争取半数耕地种麦
    【本报武安讯】县长张汉林同志本月十五日在全县干部会上布置秋收秋耕种麦工作。报告中称：春天久旱，下种共八次才完成，庄稼共分三耧，旧历五月五日前为头耧，共二十万亩，三次下种。到八月初十前后可收割。二耧四十五万亩，五月十日后下种，八月二十左右可收割。三耧三十五万亩，五月二十六到六月初下种，九月始可收割。另外尚有四万亩未下种或下种迟而没锄出来又荒了的荒地，整个秋收秋耕可连续一个月之久，老区是头、二耧庄稼，于八月底可完成种麦，均为直麦。劳畜力也大体没问题。新区则三耧庄稼多，灾情较严重，以高村，伯延两个村为例计算，到明年秋收为止，粮食短少三四个月。每口人必须种三亩麦子才行。所以从现在起，解决一切困难，紧急组织群众串麦。全县百分之五十耕地种麦，要比往年扩大百分之二十（即二十万亩）。
