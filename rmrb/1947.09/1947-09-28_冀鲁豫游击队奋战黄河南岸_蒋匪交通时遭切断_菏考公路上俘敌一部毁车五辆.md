    Ji-Lu-Yu Guerrilla Fights Vigorously on the South Bank of the Yellow River
    Chiang Bandit Transportation is Cut Off
    Part of the Enemy Captured and Five Vehicles Destroyed on the He-Kao Highway
    [This newspaper's Ji-Lu-Yu dispatch on the 24th] To cooperate with the Liu-Deng army's southward counter-offensive, the Ji-Lu-Yu enemy's rear guerrilla forces have greatly destroyed the enemy's transportation highways and cut off their supply lines, achieving brilliant results. At dawn on August 24th, just as the enemy was frequently transporting supplies on the He-Kao Highway, a part of our Heze local armed forces carried a large number of landmines and set off in four directions to ambush at Pizhuang. When enemy vehicles appeared on the highway, everyone waited with guns. As nine vehicles sped past, the landmines exploded. Our ambushing heroes leaped up nimbly, and under the cover of machine guns, surged forward. The enemy was panicked and ran around in confusion. The battle was resolved in just ten minutes. A total of three vehicles were destroyed, two good vehicles were captured, including a jeep, more than ten bags of foreign flour, ten enemies were killed, twelve enemies were wounded, and eighteen officers below the rank of lieutenant were captured. On August 29th, our Yuanjiang Guerrilla destroyed the Feng-Yu Highway. At 12 o'clock that night, the heroes waded through the mud and water and attacked a section of the highway from Yutai to Shunheji, completely destroying the roadbed and cutting off the power lines, a total of more than 100 power poles were cut down, and three miles of power lines were collected. The next day, at dawn, they safely withdrew, and the enemy's Feng-Yu supply line was completely cut off. On the highway from Minquan to Cao County, in order to maintain the safety of its supply line, the enemy dispatched parts of the puppet security regiment and Zhang Shengtai's troops to set up strongholds at Wang'an Bridge to guard it, but our guerrilla forces cooperated with the main force to attack the stronghold on September 1st. After four hours of battle, they completely occupied it. More than 30 enemies, including puppet security captain Pao Tianzan and squad leader Feng Fuli, were killed, wounded, or captured. After the Min-Cao Highway was controlled by us, the enemy's transportation stagnated.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu, 25th] The entire cadres and masses of Juancheng, Yuncheng and Linze (newly established county, southwest of Yuncheng) counties on the south bank of the Yellow River in Ji-Lu-Yu have achieved great victories in adhering to guerrilla warfare, creating favorable conditions for the main force to annihilate the enemy. Under the circumstances of the enemy troops pressing the border, the Linze Brigade dispersed into the hinterland in platoons, helping the district and village cadres and masses to hold their positions. After the enemy's large forces had passed, they concentrated their activities to attack the Home Return Corps. In 20 days, they fought 16 battles. In the battle of Zhengying, the pseudo-district office of Yihezhuang was completely annihilated, and more than 50 enemies were killed or wounded. The Home Return Corps has been unable to operate. Bian Luji, secretary of the Third District Committee of Linze, led 13 militiamen and defeated more than 200 Home Return Corps members. Ma Guang'an, a hero of 700 militiamen in Yuncheng, captured an armed agent alive. Ma Da, the county magistrate of Yunbei, led a group of cadres to persist in the struggle in several districts around Liangshan. They concealed themselves in the morning and went to the villages to work in the afternoon, winning the deep support of the masses, who automatically delivered water and food and reported enemy information. The Sixth District Committee of the county always publicized current events to the masses, who all said: "When the big river shrinks, the small river will soon dry up." (Referring to Chiang bandit's general trend is gone).
