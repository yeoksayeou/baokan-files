Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, September 9th: When the American imperialist Wedemeyer was in Nanjing at the end of July, the Chen family, one of the four big families, in order to attack others and elevate themselves in front of their master, exposed the family scandal through the "Central Daily News" they controlled, revealing that the Yangzi and Fuzhong companies of the Kong and Song families were stealing foreign exchange funds and engaging in malfeasance. This matter caused "great anger" among the leaders of the four big families and the biggest corrupt official, Chiang Kai-shek, and a tragicomedy ensued. According to the Peiping Daily News on the 9th of last month: "On July 30th, the Nanjing Central Daily News published a message saying that the Shanghai Yangzi Company, Fuzhong Company, and China Construction Company, opened with capital from the Kong and Song families, had settled over 10,000 US dollars in foreign exchange each, totaling more than 100 million each, accounting for 80 percent of the total foreign exchange amount within a year, in order to purchase prohibited luxury goods such as new cars and cosmetics. As soon as the news came out, the highest authorities (referring to Chiang Kai-shek) were greatly angered, and ordered a thorough investigation, and questioned the Ministry of Finance why these materials were leaked? Yu Hongjun (Chiang's Minister of Finance) was terrified and lashed out at all the staff of the Ministry of Finance, asking who leaked the information. It is said that the investigation proved that it was not leaked by the Ministry of Finance, so he was spared. As for the Central Daily News? Knowing that this trouble was a big deal, they could not reveal the source of the news. Two days later, they had to declare two points in the newspaper: First, a decimal point was missing from the original figure, mistakenly turning millions into hundreds of millions; second, this news definitely did not come from the financial departments. However, this trouble could not be ended there. Finally, Li Weiguo, the Minister of Propaganda of the Chiang family, led Lu Keng, the newly promoted editor-in-chief of the newspaper, as a scapegoat to apologize. At the same time, the Ministry of Finance of the Chiang family, according to Chiang Kai-shek's handwriting, made false accounts and published detailed foreign exchange settlement information, proving that Yangzi Company, etc. only obtained more than one million US dollars, and the goods imported were all "legal" (!), thus covering up this pile of stinking dog feces of the four big families, but this stench has spread all over China and abroad.

    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, September 10th: The corruption scandals within the Chiang party continue to be exposed due to factional strife within the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary group. The Nanjing Salvation Daily, hosted by the Kuomintang Fuxing system's secret service system, published an editorial on the 20th of last month, exposing the collective fraud case of the Bank of China, controlled by the Song Ziwen family, stating: "In the construction project of the five-story building at No. 94 Huangdu Road, West Shanghai, it was discovered that a huge case of stealing metal materials worth 5 billion yuan had occurred. The Bank of China did not want to pursue the matter because of the large number of Bank of China staff involved in the case, and only prepared to replace the original chief of the General Affairs Section."

    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, September 10th: Changsha, 7th: A major corruption and malfeasance case recently occurred on the Yuehan Railway. In Changsha alone, it has been found that the amount of corruption and malfeasance has reached a huge amount of 2.5 billion Chiang coins. After learning that the freight price of the railway had increased by 200% since August 1st, the stationmasters of major stations along the railway took the opportunity to purchase and hoard parcel tickets as much as possible before August 1st, and then collect commercial goods and delay their shipment. Zhou Yifang, the stationmaster of Changsha East Station, Li Wentao, the director of the Transportation Section, and Zhou Shuxiong, the deputy director, colluded with each other to issue about 50,000 parcel tickets without authorization, from which they profited a total of 2.5 billion yuan. Lian Fengxiang, the director of the Transportation Department of the railway, also took advantage of his authority to allocate vehicles, and received bribes of 5 million yuan from Zhou and others for each vehicle allocated, and tried to cover up and protect Zhou and others, and transferred them to other positions. Later, due to the uneven distribution of spoils within the group, he was reported by Jiang Guodong, the director of the railway police department.

    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, September 10th: The railway administration of the Chiang-controlled Jinghu and Huhang Railways is corrupt, theft is rampant, and passengers regard it as a dangerous road. According to a compilation of Shanghai reports and "passenger letters": Pickpocketing is rampant on the train, and passengers' money and belongings are often missing. Chiang's military police also take the opportunity to loot from time to time. In June, a passenger named Lin was robbed of 1.1 million Chiang coins by someone in uniform. On July 3rd, the Jinghu 57th passenger train was robbed of gold jewelry worth a total of 3.8 million Chiang coins by several special figures in uniform and armed with short guns after passing through Xushuguan, and one passenger was killed and injured. They calmly escaped when they arrived in Suzhou. Derailments and accidents also occur frequently. On July 3rd, the Jinghu 75th slow train derailed at @shan. According to Qingdao reports: Chen Bozhuang, the director of the Chiang-controlled Jinghu Railway Bureau, has accumulated an astonishing amount of corruption in the two years since he took over the railway. Recently, he organized a large-scale "Jinghu Enterprise Company," and Chen personally contributed 400,000 yuan, becoming an important shareholder of the company.

　　四大家族盗窃外汇基金
  　蒋介石公然包庇掩饰
  　蒋党派系倾轧不断暴露贪污案件
    【新华社陕北九日电】七月底当美帝国主义者魏德迈在南京时，四大家族中的二陈家族为在主子面前打击别人，抬高自己，曾通过其控制的“中央日报”，揭露孔、宋两大家族的扬子、孚中等公司盗窃外汇基金，营私舞弊的家丑，此事曾引起四大家族首领与最大贪污犯蒋介石“震怒”，而演出了一幕悲喜剧。据上月九日北平日报称：“七月三十日，南京中央日报登载一项消息，说孔、宋两豪门资本所开设的上海扬子公司、孚中公司、中国建设公司，在一年之内，结取外汇万元各在一亿以上，占全部外汇额百分之八十，借以购入一些违禁的奢侈品，如新式汽车及化装品之类。消息一出，最高当局（指蒋介石）大为震怒，一面严令澈查，一面责问财部为何泄出这些材料？俞鸿钧（蒋家财政部长）诚惶诚恐，并向财部大小职员大发雷霆，追问系何人泄漏，据说追查结果证明并非财部泄露，幸免于难。中央日报呢？知道这祸事惹大了，又不能说出消息的来源。过了两天，只好在报上声明两点：一是原刊数字上漏了一个小数点，误把百万弄成了一亿；二是这消息决非来自财经两部。然祸事不能就此了结，最后由蒋家宣传部长李惟果带领该社新提拔的总编辑陆铿当赎罪羊前去请罪，同时又由蒋家财政部根据蒋介石的手令造假帐，把详细结汇情形公布，证明扬子公司等只取得一百余万美汇，所进货物样样是“合法”的（！）才把四大家族这一堆臭狗屎掩饰过去，但这一股臭气已经传遍中外了。
    【新华社陕北十日电】蒋党内部的贪污黑幕，由于蒋介石反动集团内部派别的倾轧而继续暴露出来。国民党复兴系特务系统主持之南京救国日报于上月二十日发表社论，揭发为宋子文家族所控制之中国银行集体舞弊案件称：“上海中国银行翻造沪西皇渡路九十四号五楼大厦工程中，发现偷盗价值五十亿元五金材料之巨案。中国银行方面竟以该案被牵涉之中行行员，数目众多，不愿追究，只准备将原有总务科长加以调换了事”。
    【新华社陕北十日电】长沙七日讯：粤汉铁路近发生一大贪污舞弊案，单长沙一地，已发现贪污舞弊之款达二十五亿元蒋币之巨。该路各大站站长得悉该路货运价自八月一日就增价百分之二百后，遂利用机会于八月一日前尽量购藏包裹票，然后收受商货延缓运出。长沙东站长周贻芳、运输段长李文涛、副段长周树雄等互相串通擅起包裹票约五万件，从中渔利共达廿五亿元之巨。该路运输处长连风翔亦借拨调车辆职权，每调车一辆必收周等贿款五百万元，并设法掩饰包庇将周等分别调派他职。后因其内部分赃不均，而被该路警务处长蒋国栋告发。
    【新华社陕北十日电】蒋管京沪、沪杭两铁路路政腐败，盗窃横生，旅客视为畏途。综合沪报载“旅客投书”称：车上扒窃横行，旅客钱物时常不翼而飞。蒋家军警亦不时乘机劫掠。六月间曾有旅客林某被身穿制服者劫去蒋币一百一十万元。七月三日京沪第五七次客车，在驶过浒墅关后，竟被身穿制服手持短枪之特种人物数名，抢去旅客金饰总值达蒋币三百八十万元，并杀伤旅客一名，至苏州时，始从容逸去。车辆之出轨肇祸，也常常发生，七月三日即有京沪七十五次慢车在＠山出轨。又据青岛报载：蒋记京沪铁路局长陈伯庄接收该路两年，贪污累积惊人，最近组织一规模庞大之“京沪企业公司”，陈个人即出资金四十万元，成为该公司重要股东。
