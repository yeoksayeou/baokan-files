Xinhua News Agency, Western Henan Front, 28th. The democratic government in the newly liberated areas of western Henan has abolished all the Kuomintang bandits' exorbitant taxes and levies, and opened granaries to relieve the poor masses. The township democratic county government opened a granary in Chengguan to relieve 365 poor households, distributing grain at a rate of one *dou* per person, totaling more than 200 *shi*. Mianchi Chengguan and various districts distributed 50,000 *jin* of cotton, distributing it to the poor at a rate of three *jin* per adult and one and a half *jin* per child. Family members of the People's Liberation Army were given 20 *jin* per person. The poor people came to collect it in droves, and the procedures were simple. More than 20,000 people received cotton. Guanyintang, near Mianchi, was a well-known coal-producing area. In the past, it was ruled by the Kuomintang's bureaucratic capital. After the victory, the local people were not allowed to purchase or use it, and it was transported to other places for profit. Now our democratic government has announced that the coal produced by the mine will be supplied to the poor masses for free use, which has been deeply praised by the masses.

Xinhua News Agency, Western Henan Front, 28th. Due to the various democratic measures of the democratic government, prices in the new areas of western Henan have generally fallen, especially for essential goods such as grain, cotton, and edible salt. In Lingbao and Shanxian, the price of wheat has fallen by one-third to one-half. Before liberation, edible salt was 3,000 yuan of Kuomintang currency per *jin*. Now, the market price in the Caiyuan Town area of Shanxian has fallen by half, selling for 80 to 100 yuan of Jicha (one yuan of Jicha is equivalent to about 15 yuan of Kuomintang currency). The price of cotton has also fallen sharply after the democratic government distributed a large amount of cotton, with the fastest declines in cotton-producing areas such as Lingbao and Mianchi. As a result, the poor farmers, small business people, and ordinary petty citizens who suffered from the high prices during the rule of the Kuomintang bandits are all delighted. A barber in Guanyintang voluntarily reduced his price by 20%. He said, "When the 'Kuomintang bandits' were in power, shaving one's head required paying exorbitant taxes of thousands of yuan. The wool comes from the sheep, so I had to increase the price, and the people who got haircuts were unlucky. Now, although the price has been reduced, the price of grain is cheap, and my life is better."

　　This Newspaper, Taiyue, 26th. The Fencheng Democratic Government in the newly liberated area allocated 1,000 *da shi* of relief grain. The people of Fencheng suffered greatly from the oppression of the Yan Xishan diehards, especially the families of our martyrs and the poor farmers, who suffered even more severely. At this time of year between harvests and when wheat is being sown, the Fencheng Democratic Government specifically allocated 1,000 *da shi* of wheat on September 10th for relief. The masses were extremely happy and said, "Yan Xishan forced the people to die, but the Eighth Route Army saved the people. The suffering of the people of Fencheng is finally over."

    豫西物价普遍下跌
    民主政府开仓济贫
    【新华社豫西前线二十八日电】豫西新解放区民主政府废除蒋匪一切苛杂，开仓救济贫苦群众。乡民主县政府在城关开仓救济贫民三百六十五户，按每人一斗，共发粮食二百余石。渑池城关及各区发放棉花五万斤，按大人三斤、小孩斤半分发贫民，解放军家属每人发给二十斤，贫民纷来领取，手续简便，得棉者在两万人以上。渑池附近之观音堂，素为著名煤炭产地，过去为蒋匪官僚资本统治，胜利后不准当地人民购用，改运他地牟利。现我民主政府宣布该矿煤产免费供应贫苦群众烧用，深获群众称颂。
    【新华社豫西前线二十八日电】由于民主政府之各项民主措施，豫西新区物价普遍跌落，其中尤以生活必需品粮、棉、食盐为最。灵宝、陕县小麦跌价三分之一到二分之一，食盐在解放前每斤蒋币三千元，现陕县菜园镇一带集市价已跌一半，售冀钞八十元至一百元（冀钞一元约合蒋币十五元）。棉价经民主政府大量发放棉花后亦告猛跌，灵宝、渑池等产棉区下跌最快。至此，深受蒋匪统治时物价高涨压迫的贫苦农民、小本工商及一般小市民莫不欣然于色。观音堂一理发工人自动减价百分之二十，他说：“刮民党”在时，理个发要征苛杂千把元，羊毛出在羊身上，只好加价，该理发的人倒霉。如今虽然减了价，但粮价便宜，我的日子反而过得更美了。
    【本报太岳二十六日电】新解放区汾城民主政府拨放救济粮一千大石。汾城人民受阎顽压榨，痛苦不堪，尤其我军干烈属及贫苦农民，受害更是深重，值此青黄不接与种麦之时，汾城民主政府特于九月十日拨麦子一千大石进行救济，群众异常高兴，都说：“阎老西迫百姓死，八路军救百姓活，汾城人民的难算是受完了。”
