Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, September 9th. According to TASS, Moscow, September 7th, U.S. Undersecretary of State Lovett sent a letter to the Soviet government on August 26th, suggesting a four-power conference of the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and China to discuss the formation of the Korean parliament and provisional government. The Soviet Foreign Minister recently replied to U.S. Secretary of State Marshall, stating: "As is well known, the mission of the Soviet-U.S. Joint Commission is to assist in the formation of a provisional democratic government in all of Korea. This mission has not yet been achieved, and the main reason for this is the attitude of the U.S. representatives. The Soviet government believes that it is not appropriate for the United States to submit the issue of establishing a Korean provisional democratic government to the four powers for handling, because the Soviet-U.S. Joint Commission is not incapable of making a proposal for an agreement. The American proposal put forward by Lovett is unacceptable, as it first proposes the establishment of separate provisional legislative assemblies in North and South Korea, and then the establishment of a national legislative assembly, which will inevitably create an even greater division in Korea than exists at present. The solemn task at hand is to establish a unified, all-Korean provisional democratic government as soon as possible." The letter pointed out: "Discussions on the Korean question by the four-power representatives also do not comply with the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers' Conference resolution on Korea."

　　美建议四国讨论朝鲜问题
  　苏外长依约拒绝
    【新华社陕北九日电】据塔斯社莫斯科七日讯，八月二十六日，美副国务卿罗维特致函苏联政府，建议召开美英苏中四国会议，以讨论朝鲜议会及临时政府之组成问题。苏外长顷复函美国务卿马歇尔称：“如所周知，苏美联合委员会之使命，乃协助全朝鲜组成一临时民主政府，此项使命迄无成就，其主要原因，为美代表态度所造成。苏联政府认为，美国将成立朝鲜临时民主政府问题交付四国处理并非得宜，因苏美联合委员会并非不可能作出一协议之建议案。罗维特所提美国建议案是不可能接受的，该建议案提出首先成立南北朝鲜单独的临时立法议会，然后才成立全国立法议会，其结果必造成比目前朝鲜更甚的分裂。而当前庄严的工作，乃是尽可能于最早日期成立统一的全朝鲜临时民主政府。”该函指出：“四国代表讨论朝鲜问题，也不符合莫斯科三外长会议关于朝鲜的决议。”
