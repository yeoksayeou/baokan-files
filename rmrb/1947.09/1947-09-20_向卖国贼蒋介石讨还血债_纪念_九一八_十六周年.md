　　Demand Blood Debt from Traitor Chiang Kai-shek
  　Commemorating the 16th Anniversary of the "September 18th" Incident

    At the time of the "September 18th" Incident, in order to please his Japanese masters and eliminate the dissenting Northeast Army so that he could freely slaughter the Chinese people, the traitor Chiang handed over the beautiful land of Northeast China to the enemy.

    The Northeast Army at the time, although possessing relatively good equipment, training, and a high degree of anti-Japanese enthusiasm, lacked a clear political goal and could not embody the people's aspirations. It only knew how to blindly obey. It obeyed Chiang's absolute non-resistance order, abandoned the Northeast compatriots to the west, and then Chiang destroyed the Great Wall resistance, forced General Zhang Xueliang away, and successively handed over Rehe and eastern Hebei to the enemy, and transferred the Northeast Army to carry out "Communist suppression" civil war, using a borrowed knife to kill people. The 115th, 110th, and 109th Divisions were successively annihilated. But these also promoted the awakening of the Northeast Army. With the rising national anti-Japanese salvation movement, the Northeast Army officers and soldiers' demands for resisting Japan became increasingly firm, so they united with the Northwest Army and launched the December 12th Incident. After the Chinese Communist Party's righteous mediation, the traitor Chiang was forced to accept the proposals of Generals Zhang and Yang. But the rogue Chiang Kai-shek returned to Nanjing, immediately went back on his word, detained Zhang Xueliang, and murdered Wang Yizhe, further disbanding the Northeast Army.

    After the July 7th Resistance War, the traitor Chiang took the opportunity to disperse the Northeast Army and used it in the most difficult front-line isolated battles. Although the Northeast Army bravely killed the enemy and repeatedly established military exploits, such as the famous defense of Shanghai, the bloody battle of the Huai River, and the滇缅作战 [Yunnan-Burma Campaign], it suffered heavy losses. The traitor Chiang not only did not replenish it, but took the opportunity to reorganize and merge it, changed its appearance, and canceled its designation. The brave soldiers who killed the enemy, the dead exposed their bones, and the living wandered, their wives and children scattered. To this day, they are still wandering on the Sichuan-Shaanxi road, unable to return home. This is the tragic end of the meritorious Northeast Army in the war of resistance caused by the traitor Chiang.

    After the liberation of Northeast China, the Northeast people had not yet rested, and the Chiang family bandit gang immediately took advantage of the planes and warships of American imperialism to enter Northeast China one after another to plunder the people. The traitor Chiang, who sold out Northeast China, reused enemy agents and traitors, and kept bandits, replacing the "Manchukuo" rule that regarded Japanese imperialism as its father with a traitorous rule that regarded American imperialism as its father, which the people called the Second Manchukuo. This is an incisive irony. To this day, the people in the Chiang-controlled areas of Northeast China are still living in dire straits under the rule of the "Second Manchukuo."

    In the actual life experience of the past sixteen years since the "September 18th" Incident, the Northeast people have gradually recognized the traitorous face of Chiang and recognized that the Chinese Communist Party is the only savior of the Northeast people. Under the leadership and cultivation of the CCP, the traditional patriotic forces of the Northeast people have gradually formed. The Anti-Japanese Allied Army was created in Northeast China, and the arduous anti-Japanese struggle was persisted for fourteen years. Advanced people and exiled students in Northeast China launched and persisted in the anti-Japanese national salvation movement in Guannei. After the July 7th Resistance War, there was a part of the 53rd Army in central Hebei, Zhang Xuesi's unit in southern Hebei, and a part of the 57th Army in Binhai. Under the support of the Eighth Route Army, they have been greatly developed and trained to become elite troops in the people's anti-Japanese war and pioneers in recovering Northeast China. Before the Japanese surrender, these patriotic Northeast heroes and the Northeast Anti-Japanese Allied Army and parts of the New Fourth Army and the Eighth Route Army joined forces in Northeast China to form the current Northeast Democratic Allied Army, destroying the remaining enemy puppets, attacking the Chiang army's offensive against the Northeast people, and liberating most of Northeast China and more than half of the people. Today, two kinds of forces, old and new, are engaged in a life-and-death struggle in Northeast China, one is the traditional force of Chiang's traitorous dictatorship, and the other is the traditional force of people's patriotism.

    But the situation of the Chiang bandit gang is like the setting sun. Chen Cheng, who has just been replaced in Northeast China, has long been a loser under the people's army, and one crab is worse than another. No matter how he shouts: "We must recover all the lost land from the 'Communist bandits' (the people)," "It will only take six months to restore the advantage." This can only be a schoolmaster-style pretense, and it cannot scare anyone. No force (including the assistance of its foreign father) can save its inevitable death. The situation of the Northeast people is just like the rising sun. In the past two years, the Northeast people have turned over in the great land reform movement. Millions of people have obtained land, established democratic power, and basically destroyed feudal rule. The progress in the past two years has surpassed the progress of the past decades or hundreds of years. This progressive force is growing rapidly and will inevitably become the force that determines everything.

    The historical process of the sixteen years since the "September 18th" Incident has undergone tremendous changes. The Northeast people have changed from an extremely unfavorable situation to an unprecedentedly favorable situation. Our task of commemorating September 18th is to: develop this favorable situation, actively and boldly strengthen the people's forces, expand the people's army, completely and thoroughly eliminate the Chiang bandits in Northeast China, overthrow Chiang Kai-shek, eliminate the traitorous tradition of the "Second Manchukuo," and strive to liberate the entire Northeast.

    General Zhang Xueliang's subordinates, classmates of the Military Academy, and officers and soldiers of the Northeast Army! You have endured Chiang's deception and persecution for a long time. Now is the time to take revenge on Chiang and make contributions to the people! Today, Chiang is facing his doomsday. You must choose your own path as soon as possible, organize uprisings, lead uprisings, and stand on the side of the people!

    Today's era is the era of the people. The Northeast people must have the courage and knowledge, must dare to win, and resolutely act to finally eliminate the traitorous rule of the "Second Manchukuo" and be able to win the victory of liberating the entire Northeast.

　　向卖国贼蒋介石讨还血债
  　纪念“九一八”十六周年
    吕正操
    “九一八”事变时，蒋贼为了讨好日本主子，消灭异己的东北军，以便放手屠杀中国人民，就把东北大好河山拱手送敌。
    当时的东北军，虽然保有较优良的装备与训练，和高度的抗日热情，但因它是旧式军队，缺乏明确的政治目标，不能体现人民的愿望，只知盲目服从。听任蒋贼的绝对不抵抗命令，撇开东北同胞西移，继之蒋贼又破坏了长城抗战，逼走了张学良将军，把热河冀东相继送给敌人，并调东北军进行“剿共”内战，借刀杀人，百十五师、百十师、百零九师先后被歼。但这些也促进了东北军的觉悟。在全国抗日救亡运动日益高涨下，东北军官兵要求抗日也日益坚决，因此联合西北军爆发了双十二事变，经过中共大义调解，蒋贼被迫接受了张杨两将军的主张。但流氓蒋介石回到南京，立即变卦扣押张学良，谋杀王以哲，进一步拆散了东北军。
    七七抗战后，蒋贼更趁机分散东北军，使用在最艰险的前线孤军作战，虽然东北军奋勇杀敌，屡建战功，如有名的保卫淞沪、淮河血战、滇缅作战等，但遭到惨重的损失。蒋贼不仅不予补充，反而趁机编遣编并，改头换面，取消番号。奋勇杀敌的将士，死者暴骨，生者流浪，妻离子散。时至今日，依然徘徊于川陕道上，有家归不得，这就是蒋贼所造成的抗战有功的东北军悲惨的下场。
    东北解放后，东北人民尚未苏息，蒋家匪帮立即乘美帝国主义的飞机军舰，纷纷进入东北，向人民劫收。出卖东北的蒋贼，重用敌特汉奸，豢养胡匪，把美国帝国主义当爸爸的卖国统治代替了把日本帝国主义当作爸爸的“满洲国”统治，被人民称之为二满洲。这是一针见血的讽喻。直到今天，东北蒋区人民还在“二满洲”的统治下，过着水深火热苟延残喘的生活。
    东北人民在十六年来实际生活体验中，已逐渐认清了蒋贼卖国面目，并认识了中国共产党是东北人民唯一的救星，在中共领导和培植之下，逐渐形成了东北人民爱国主义的传统力量。在东北创造了抗日联军，并坚持了十四年间艰苦卓绝的抗日斗争。在关内东北先进人士和流亡学生展开和坚持了抗日救国运动，七七抗战后，在冀中有五十三军之一部，在冀南有张学思所部，在滨海有五十七军之一部，都在八路军扶植之下，得到了大量的发展，并锻炼成为人民抗日战争的劲旅，收复东北的先锋。日寇投降之前，这些东北爱国健儿和东北抗日联军及新四军、八路军之各一部，会师东北，组成现在东北的民主联军，摧毁敌伪残余，打击了蒋军向东北人民的进攻，解放了东北大部分地区，和半数以上的人民。今天在东北的新旧两种力量正在展开死活的斗争，一种是蒋贼卖国独裁的传统力量，一种是人民爱国主义的传统力量。
    但蒋匪集团的情况正是日落西山，新换来东北的陈诚，早是人民军队手下败将，一蟹不如一蟹，不管他如何喊叫：“一定要从‘共匪’（人民）手中收复一切失地”，“只需六个月即恢复优势”。这只能是教师爷方式的装腔，吓不倒任何人。任何力量（包括其洋爸爸的援助在内），决不能挽救其必然死亡的命运。而东北人民的情况则正如旭日方升，两年来东北人民在伟大的土地改革运动中翻了身，千百万人民获得了土地，建立了民主政权，基本上摧毁了封建统治，两年来的进步，超过了过去几十年几百年的进步，这个进步力量正在飞速的成长着，必然成为决定一切的力量。
    “九一八”以来十六年的历史进程，发生了巨大的变化，东北人民已从极端不利的情况，转到空前有利的情况，我们纪念九一八的任务就是：发展这个有利情况，积极放手壮大人民力量，扩大人民军队，全部彻底消灭东北蒋匪，打倒蒋介石，肃清“二满洲”的卖国传统，争取解放全东北。
    张学良将军的部下，讲武堂的同学，东北军的官兵们！你们长期忍受蒋贼的愚弄陷害，现在是向蒋贼报仇为人民立功的时候了！今天蒋贼已经面临末日，你们要及早选择自己的道路，组织起义，领导起义，站到人民方面来！
    今天的时代是人民的时代，东北人民必须有胆有识，必须敢于胜利，坚决的行动起来，就一定能够最后消灭“二满洲”的汉奸统治，就一定能够取得解放全东北的胜利。
