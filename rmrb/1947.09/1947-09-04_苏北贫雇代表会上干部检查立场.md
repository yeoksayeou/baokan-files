Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 31st - Subei cadres at all levels are strictly examining right-leaning thought and the rich peasant line during the re-examination process, launching a movement to "cut off tails" and "close back doors." The Subei Daily first published an editorial pointing out: The unstable stance, right-leaning tendencies, and rich peasant ideology of some cadres and party members in the distribution of spoils are major reasons why last year's land reform and this spring's re-examination were not thorough. It called for immediate correction. Subsequently, Huai'an, Ye Ting, Funing, Lian (shui) Dong, Construction, and other counties successively convened poor peasant representative conferences or activist conferences, with cadres examining themselves from top to bottom. Wang Yixiang, secretary of the Huai'an County Committee, took the lead, saying: "In the past, the leadership was afraid of going too 'left' and made concessions to feudal forces everywhere, restricting the mass struggle. For example, last autumn, when villagers in a certain village wanted to recover all the property of the landlord, he was afraid of chaos and personally supervised it overnight, not allowing the masses to act. The masses believed that giving the landlord's family twenty mu of land would be enough for their livelihood, but he insisted on supplying forty mu." A certain district chief confessed that he had lost his revolutionary stance. Knowing that land reform was to be implemented, he first wrote to his father to sell land, and then pretended to offer land, handing the land over to unawakened peasants, actually offering it nominally but not in reality, so that the peasants had to secretly apologize to him at night after struggling against his father during the day. Among the forty-five cadres in the two joint defense townships of Shunhe District in Huai'an, thirty-three confessed to right-leaning and rich peasant thoughts such as distributing too much land, retaining too much land, and protecting landlords' land. After deep introspection, the class consciousness of cadres at all levels was further clarified, and they were determined to "cut off tails" and "close back doors," conscientiously implementing the new land re-examination policy of the East China Bureau.

　　苏北贫雇代表会上干部检查立场
    【新华社华中三十一日电】苏北各级干部在复查中严格检查右倾思想及富农路线，展开割尾巴关后门运动。苏北日报首先发表社论指出：部分干部与党员立场不稳、右倾和分果实中的富农思想，成为去年土地改革及今春复查未能彻底的主要原因之一，号召立即纠正。接着淮安、叶挺、阜宁、涟（水）东、建设等县即先后召开雇贫农代表大会或活动分子大会，干部自上而下反省检查。淮安县书王一香首先带头，他说：“过去领导上生怕过“左”，处处对封建势力让步，限制了群众斗争。如去秋某村农民要把地主财产全部索回，他却惟恐出乱子，亲自监视了一夜，不许群众动手。群众认为给该地主家二十亩田即足够其生活了，但他却要群众供给四十亩。某区长检讨出自己失掉革命立场，知道要实行土地改革，就先写信叫父亲卖地，继又假献田，把地交给未觉悟的农民，实际上明献暗不献，以至农民白天斗了他父亲，晚上不得不又偷偷向他道歉。淮安顺河区两个联防乡四十五个干部中，有三十三个检讨出多分地、多留地及包庇地主土地等右倾和富农思想。经过深刻反省，各级干部阶级观念进一步明确，决心“割尾巴”“关后门”，认真贯澈华东局土地复查新方针。
