　　Whole Village of Beilizhuang Helps Each Other
　　Seedlings Hoed Three Times, Wheat Fields Plowed Twice

　　[Report from Our Newspaper] Beilizhuang in the Fifth District of Pingxiang is a small village of one hundred and six households. During the famine of 1943, the village had mutual aid organizations, but only Wang Buxi's group maintained long-term mutual assistance. The masses saw with their own eyes that their mutual aid was convenient, saved labor, and made money. This year, when organizing mutual aid before the wheat season, Wang Buxi actively promoted it, using his own practical examples to illustrate the benefits of mutual aid and helping the masses solve difficulties. As a result, the whole village quickly organized. The whole village organized fifteen mutual aid groups in a voluntary manner, totaling one hundred people and eleven livestock. Each group had a leader, and the whole village formed a mutual aid brigade, electing Wang Buxi as the brigade leader and Wang Dianchen as the deputy brigade leader, to unify the leadership of the village's mutual aid movement. As a result, the entire village's more than 300 mu of wheat fields were harvested in one day, and the whole process, including drying and threshing, took only two days. The masses further understood the benefits of mutual aid and became even more energetic in weeding the seedlings. When weeding, the whole village worked in the morning, using a horn as a signal, getting up before dawn. Wang Buxi's group worked so hard that they could only see the sun briefly in the morning and evening, and they hoed the ground while talking and laughing, shouting and working forward, as if they were racing. Wang Quanxi said, "If you are faster than me, I will be even faster; if you are better than me, I will be even better. The competition makes the hoeing fast and good, and we don't feel tired at all, it's really great." Li Ersuo of Li Changchun's group used to be lazy and only liked to catch pigeons and fish. In the past, he had never hoed his fields more than twice, and the fields were almost like grasslands. With a family of six, they could barely manage their 20 mu of land. This year, after participating in mutual aid and organizing, the land has been hoed three times, and the seedlings are truly different from previous years. They save labor through mutual aid and go to cultivate wheat fields. Now all the wheat fields have been plowed twice (in previous years, they were plowed once), and all 1,595 mu of autumn fields have been hoed three times, with 48 mu hoed four times (in previous years, they were hoed only twice). Now sorghum and millet are being dried. (Victory News)

　　北李庄全村大互助
  　苗锄三遍麦地二犁
    【本报讯】平乡五区北李庄是一个一百零六户的小村，该村在三十二年灾荒期曾有过互助的组织，唯有王布喜一组一直长期互助着；群众都亲眼看到他们互助方便又省工又赚钱。今年麦前组织互助时，王布喜又积极活动，以自己的实事来说明互助的好处，帮助群众解决困难，于是很快的全村便组织起来。全村以自愿结合的方式组织一十五个互助组，共一百人，十一个牲口。各组设组长一人，全村为一个互助大队，选王布喜为互助大队长，王殿臣为副队长，统一领导全村的互助运动。这样一来，全村三百余亩麦地，一天即割完，连晒带打共用了两天多的工夫。群众更进一步了解到互助的好处，在锄苗当中更加带了劲。锄苗的时候，全村统一上晌，喊筒子为号，天不明就起来。王布喜组上晌下晌两头不见太阳，并在地里一面谈笑，一面锄地打着喊，往前干，简直和赛跑一样，王全喜说：“你比我快我比你还快，你比我好我比你还好，比赛的锄又快又好，又不觉累，真高兴极了。”李长春组的李二所，以往不好干活，光好捉鸽钓鱼的，以往的地没有锄过两遍的，地简直和草场一样，一家六口人，二十亩地还顾不上口，今年参加了互助，转变组织起来，地已锄过三遍，苗子比起往年来真有天地之差别。他们互助省下工夫，又去耕麦地，现在麦地全部犁过二遍（往年耕一遍），一千五百九十五亩秋地俱已锄过三遍，其中有四十八亩锄过四遍（往年只锄两遍），现在高粱正晒小米。（胜利报）
