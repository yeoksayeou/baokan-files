Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 31st – Chiang Kai-shek’s troops, rampaging north of the Daqing River in central Hebei, have breached the dikes of the Daqing River, the Juma River, and the Pu River in several places, attempting to use floods to sever the north and south of the Daqing River in order to firmly control the Tianjin-Beijing-Baoding triangle area. Twelve breaches were made in the Daqing River dikes at Baigou, Zhongwang, and Zhuangtou above Xiong County, and at Longjia, Wangjiachang, and Yangjiachang below Xiong County. More than eighty zhang of the southern dike of the Juma River at Gou Shi Village in Rongcheng County was breached, and the Duogong section of the Pu River within Xu Shui County was also breached. Flooding has already occurred in the riverine areas of Xu Shui, An Xin, and other counties. The enemy is also building river-blocking dikes near the Daqing River and Wangjiachang, intending to force the Daqing River water into the Baicao Depression, blocking the Zhao Wang River, making it impossible for Baiyang Lake to discharge, in order to submerge the low-lying areas of Wenan, Dacheng, and Renqiu counties south of the Daqing River. Central Hebei has suffered from severe drought this summer, but the autumn crops in Wenan and the surrounding low-lying areas of Baiyang Lake are exceptionally good, unprecedented in the past decade, and can be harvested after this month. The enemy's atrocity of breaching the river will cause disaster for millions of people in central Hebei. The Administrative Office of Central Hebei and the counties along the river have formed a River Management Committee for Struggle Against the Enemy, leading the people of central Hebei to arm themselves for emergency rescue, and resolutely smash the enemy's poisonous plot to flood central Hebei.

　　蒋军掘开大清等河
  　冀中人民面临灾难
    【新华社晋察冀三十一日电】窜扰冀中大清河北之各地蒋军，掘开大清河，拒马河、瀑河等河堤多处，企图以大水隔断大清河南北，以确掌平津保三角地区。雄县以上之白沟、中旺、庄头及雄县以下之龙家、王家场、杨家场等处大清河堤被掘开十二处，容城沟市村拒马河南堤被掘开八十余丈，徐水境内之瀑河垛工处亦被掘开，大水已在徐水、安新等县沿河地区泛滥。敌并在大清河、王家场附近筑拦河垛、拟将大清河水逼入百草洼，淤塞赵王河，使白洋淀无法宣泄，以淹没大清河南之文安、大城、任邱等县洼地。今夏冀中苦旱，惟文安及白洋淀周围等洼地秋禾极好，为十年来所未有，本月后即可收割。敌之决河暴行，即将造成冀中数百万人民的灾难。刻冀中行署与沿河各县已组成对敌斗争治河委员会，领导冀中人民武装抢险，坚决粉碎敌水淹冀中的毒计。
