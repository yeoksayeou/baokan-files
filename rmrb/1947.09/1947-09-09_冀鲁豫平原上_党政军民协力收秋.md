　　On the North China Plain
  　Party, Government, Army and People Unite to Harvest the Autumn Crop
    [Our newspaper's dispatch from North China, 7th] After the heavy rains in the North China region, the autumn crops have ripened. The plain is filled with the scene of the autumn harvest. Party, government, and army organs are working hard to help the masses in their stationed areas with the harvest. More than 50 cadres and miscellaneous personnel from the Military Region Headquarters formed ten groups and went to the fields after the heavy rain on the 20th of last month. They actively helped with the autumn harvest, wielding their sickles. The original plan was to dedicate five hours each day to harvesting for the masses, but everyone saw that the sorghum was ripe and worried that it would sprout if buried in the water. They voluntarily added three hours. On the same day, they helped eight poor farmers harvest fourteen mu of sorghum and overturned two mu of sweet potato seedlings. Everyone was in high spirits. For example, female comrade Wang Guirong did not sleep while on duty at night but still participated in the autumn harvest during the day. Comrade Xu participated in the autumn harvest during the day and also attended mass struggle meetings at night. To assist with the harvest, the Qidi Committee organs specially convened cadres and miscellaneous personnel on the evening of the 16th of last month to discuss the issue of assisting with the autumn harvest. The next morning, Minister Wang took the lead in going to the fields. Minister Ding was ill and had worked late into the night, but he still participated in the assistance with the harvest. Female comrade Qi Yaomin harvested while encouraging everyone. From dawn to breakfast, in an hour and a half, the Zheng Hongzhang assistance group and over ten comrades had completely harvested one and a half mu of sorghum.

　　冀鲁豫平原上
  　党政军民协力收秋
    【本报冀鲁豫七日电】冀鲁豫大雨后，秋禾已熟，平原上一片秋收景象，党政军各机关正努力帮助驻地群众收割。军区司令部干杂人员五十余人，编成十个组，于上月二十日大雨后上地，挥镰积极帮助秋收，原计划每天抽出五小时为群众收割，但大家看到高粱都已熟透，怕被埋在水中生芽子，便自动多报三个钟头，当天即帮助八家贫农，收割了十四亩高粱。翻了二亩红薯秧。大家情绪极高，如女同志王桂荣夜里值班没睡觉，白天仍参加秋收。许某同志在白天帮助秋收，晚上仍参加群众斗争会。为了助收，七地委机关，上月十六日晚上特别召集干杂人员，开会研究助秋收问题，次日早晨，王部长带头下地，丁部长身体有病，且熬夜工作，但仍参加助收。女同志祁耀民，一面收割，一面鼓励大家。从天明到早饭一个半钟头内，郑鸿章助收组十余位同志，就把一亩半高粱收割得干干净净。
