Landlord Elements Among Cadres
　　Should Be Handled by the Masses
　　Yuanqu Gains Preliminary Experience
　　[Our Newspaper Taiyue 5th Dispatch] Yuanqu has gained preliminary experience in resolving the issue of military, cadre, and martyr family members who are of landlord status. At the beginning of dealing with this issue, many cadres and masses had quite a few erroneous ideas; for example, some people said, "Officials are officials, the people are the people, monks are for their own temples." "People eat here, sleep here, and have more influence than us," etc. Based on this situation, the approach of handing the problem over to the masses for discussion and handling was adopted, and good results were obtained. When the masses of Ding Village in Yuanqu resolved the problem of district cadre Xu Dengke, they raised the question: Who is being a cadre for? to open up the minds of the masses. Some said, "Xu Dengke also mobilizes the masses to fight feudalism, but the feudal tail of his family is big and long, why not fight him?" Some proposed: Is this for the masses, or to preserve the property of his family? This sparked a debate. When struggling against Xu Dengke, the masses proposed: "We are not struggling against you, district cadre Xu Dengke. If you are a cadre and serve the masses, we resolutely support you. We are struggling against your landlord exploitation in the first half of your life. All the property of your family belongs to us farmers and should be returned to the farmers. Then we will take care of your district cadre family's life from our fruits. You know this is given by the masses, not the inheritance left by your landlord ancestors." In this way, Comrade Xu Dengke happily accepted the opinions of the masses, put down the burden, and worked more actively. Comrade Ma Pengfei, secretary of the Yuanqu County Committee, also wrote to the village cadres asking for liquidation, saying: "All the property of my family was obtained by exploiting the blood and sweat of the peasants through feudal methods. Last year, there was a rent reduction and liquidation, but it was still not thorough. Now I am not considering how to take care of myself, but how to mobilize the masses to liquidate me." As a result, the masses became bolder and liquidated his family's 28 rooms, 190 mu of land, 30 yuan in silver dollars, and four or five bundles. The movement proved that as long as we can boldly let the masses handle it, the masses are the best at distinguishing right from wrong.

　　干属地主
    应交群众处理
  　垣曲得到初步经验
    【本报太岳五日电】垣曲在解决地主成份之军干烈属问题上，已得到初步经验。该县在开始处理此问题时，在许多干部、群众中有不少错误的想法；如有人说：“官为官，民为民，和尚为他寺里人”。“人家吃在里头，睡在里头，说话比咱有势力。”等依据此种情况，采取了把问题交给群众讨论处理的方针，获得好的结果；垣曲丁村群众解决区干部续登科的问题时，提出：当干部是为谁？来打通群众思想。有的说：“续登科还发动群众斗封建，他家的封建尾巴又大又长，为什么不斗他呢？”有的提出：这是为群众呢，还是为保存他家庭财产？引起一场争论。当斗争续登科时，群众提出：“我们不是斗争你区干部续登科，你当了干部为，群众服务，我们坚决拥护。我们是斗争你前半辈子的地主剥削。你家全部财产都是我们农民的，都应拿出来还农民，我们再从我们的果实中照顾你区干部家庭生活。你知道这是群众给的，不是你那地主祖宗留给你的遗产。”这样，续登科同志便愉快的接受了群众的意见，放下包袱，更积极的工作了。垣曲县委会秘书马鹏飞同志，因此也给村干部写信要求清算，他说：“我家的全部财产，都是用封建方法剥削农民的血汗，去年曾经一度减租清算，但仍不彻底，我现在不是考虑如何照顾我，而是如何发动群众来清算我。”这样一来，群众胆也壮了，就清算了他家的房二十八间、土地一百九十亩、现洋三十元、包袱四、五个。运动中证明：只要能够大胆放手交给群众处理，群众是最会辨别是非好坏的。
