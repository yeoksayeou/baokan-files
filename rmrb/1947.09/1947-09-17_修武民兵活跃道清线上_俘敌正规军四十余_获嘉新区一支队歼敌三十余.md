The Xiuwu Militia Active on the Daqing Line
　　Capturing Over Forty Enemy Regular Soldiers
　　Jia County New District Detachment Annihilates Over Thirty Enemy Soldiers
　　[This dispatch] On August 27th, over thirty members of the Xiuwu Third District rotation warfare team, divided into three groups, were active on the Daqing Line. They encountered a platoon from the 38th Division of the enemy in Jiaozuo, with two machine guns, escorting the Jiaozuo enemy's station hospital, the 44th Hygiene Brigade's 2nd Company, consisting of 44 personnel, along with three treacherous bullies acting as guides. They were traveling from the Zhanggongpu and Gaotun areas, heading to Xinxiang via Xiuwu. At this moment, our rotation warfare team bravely charged and intercepted the enemy escort troops at Gaotun. When only twenty paces away from the enemy, the enemy asked, "Which unit is this, what are you doing!" We calmly and cleverly replied, "We are the Qian Dong Township Self-Defense Force, here to escort you through." The enemy believed this to be true and said it was good, then handed over the task to us, slung the machine guns, and retreated back to Jiaozuo. At this time, another part of the rotation warfare team intercepted the enemy hygiene team at Zhanggongpu and, without firing a shot, captured all 44 enemy personnel and the three treacherous bullies, with no one escaping.
　　[This dispatch] In recent days, the Chiang bandits and the Jia County "Security Regiment" have been frantically sweeping our newly recovered areas, implementing a brutal policy of burning, killing, looting, raping, and conscripting. On August 19th, our First Detachment (originally composed of Xiuwu Jia County militia) returned from a mission. Upon seeing their homes, some found their parents, brothers, and sisters robbed or brutally murdered, some had their houses burned down, and the property of the masses had been looted. This ignited the fire of revenge in the hearts of all commanders and fighters. Therefore, that very evening, they launched an attack into the enemy's heartland, planning to ambush the enemy on the road and inflict a painful blow. Just as the sun rose above the horizon, they encountered the enemy, composed of four puppet township governments and a company from the Chiang bandit "Security Regiment," approximately two hundred men, with several machine guns. Our bugle call for the charge sounded, and the enemy company commander was shot down from his command post by our soldiers' accurate marksmanship. Third Platoon Leader Comrade Yang Buqing personally held a machine gun, charging forward, while directing the troops. He was the first to approach the enemy, and under the powerful cover of the machine gun, the brave men of the three platoons, like fierce tigers, charged with a roar, scaring the enemy into fleeing in panic. Another enemy company commander, with a machine gun squad, failed to escape and hid in a courtyard, planning to defend it to the death. However, after a volley of grenades from our first platoon and shouts of "Lay down your arms and you will not be killed," machine guns and rifles were surrendered, and thirteen enemies were taken prisoner. This battle lasted about an hour. An enemy force twice our size was defeated by us. The battle thus ended. The brave men of the three platoons, with light steps, carrying the prisoners and captured weapons, gathered in the center of the village, excited and happy, to tally the results of the battle. It was counted that we had captured alive the enemy company commander (i.e., platoon leader) and twenty-three others, wounded another enemy company commander and twelve others, and killed three; we captured one light machine gun, twenty-two rifles, one thousand five hundred and eighty rounds of ammunition, and dozens of grenades. Our army suffered no casualties, consuming only five hundred rounds of ammunition.

　　修武民兵活跃道清线上
  　俘敌正规军四十余
  　获嘉新区一支队歼敌三十余
    【本报讯】八月二十七日修武三区轮战队三十余人，分三路在道清线上活动，适遇焦作敌三十八师一个排，携机枪两挺掩护焦作之敌兵站医院四十四卫生大队二中队四十四名，另有引路奸霸三名，路经张弓铺、郜屯一带，往修武到新乡去。这时我轮战队勇猛冲杀，截住敌掩护部队于郜屯。与敌仅隔二十余步远时，敌问：“那一部分，干什么！”我沉着机智回答：“前董乡自卫团，来掩护你们过路。”敌信为真，并说很好，随将任务交我，背起机枪缩头回去焦作。这时轮战队另一部截获敌卫生队于张弓铺，而一枪未发，将敌四十四名、奸霸三名俘获，无一漏网。
    【本报讯】连日来蒋匪、获嘉“保安团”向我新收复区疯狂扫荡，实行烧、杀、抢、奸、拉等残酷政策。八月十九日，我一支队（原修获武民兵组成的）由某天归来，再看自己的家里，有的父母、兄弟、姐妹、被抢走或残杀，有的房子被烧掉，群众家财被掠一空，激起了全队指战员的复仇怒火，于是于当天晚上即出击到敌人腹心；计划在路上截敌，给以痛击。太阳刚出了地平线，就碰上了敌人，是由四个伪乡公所，和蒋匪“保安团”一个连组成的，约二百人，几挺机枪。我们的冲锋号响了，敌中队长被我战士的准确射法从指挥台上打下来，三排长杨步清同志，亲自持着机枪，打着冲过去，一面并指挥着队伍，最先接近了敌人，在强有力的机枪掩护下，三个排的勇士，象猛虎似的一个杀声冲上去，吓的敌人抱头鼠窜。敌另一个中队长，带着一个机枪班，未得跑脱，藏在一个院子里计划死守，但在我一排子手榴弹、和一阵“缴枪不杀”的叫喊声之下，机枪步枪给送了出来，十三个敌人当了俘虏。此次战斗约一个钟头，大于我们二倍的敌兵，被我打垮了，战斗于是结束。三个排的勇士，踏着轻快的步伐，带着俘虏，和缴获的武器，兴奋而愉快的齐集在村子的中央，清查战果，计：生俘敌中队长（即排长）以下廿三名，伤敌另一中队长以下十二名，击毙三名；缴获轻机枪一挺，步枪二十二支，子弹一千五百八十发，手榴弹数十枚，我军一无伤亡，仅消耗子弹五百发。
