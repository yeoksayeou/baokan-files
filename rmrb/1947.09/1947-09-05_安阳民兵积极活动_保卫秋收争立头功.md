Anyang Militia Actively Participate
　　Defend the Autumn Harvest and Strive for First-Class Merit
　　[Report from this newspaper in Anyang] Anyang has summarized the guerrilla warfare of the past half-month from the 4th to the 18th of last month, with great gains: a total of 56 battles, killing or wounding 105 enemies, killing 8 special agents, capturing 6 enemies, arresting 11 local bullies, and seizing weapons such as rifles, pistols, and landmines, laying the foundation for defending the autumn harvest. The characteristics of this period of struggle are: 1. Under the leadership of cadres and the active participation of the militia district cadres, the enemy's attempts to seize grain and conscript soldiers and the activities of special agents were attacked, covering the timely transfer of the masses in the border villages. Some villages along the border also automatically organized joint defense teams to protect conscripts, and fought alongside the militia to carry out armed self-defense struggles among the masses along the border. 2. The masses were organized to produce in an organized manner. Under armed cover, the enemy's attempts to conscript soldiers were met with failure everywhere. The joint defense pact was implemented, and wherever there was gunfire, they would go to support. Night patrols were banned, small-scale sorties were conducted, and flexible camping was used, so that the enemy could not grasp our situation. 3. The militia working teams actively responded to the call to defend the autumn harvest and not let the enemy seize a single grain. Under the slogan of "achieving merit first and striving for first-class merit," the Zhang You working team in our Fifth District fired the first shot. On the night of the 17th of this month, they personally led more than ten militiamen behind enemy lines to capture Liu Tingrui and another messenger from the Sixth Company of Liu Lexian's Second Brigade, seizing one pistol and one rifle, and intercepting more than 20 smugglers. In addition to issuing a circular of commendation, the command rewarded the team with 3,500 silver dollars and 100 bullets. This movement is still continuing.

　　[Report from this newspaper in Taiyue on the 3rd] The liberated armed forces in the First District of Yishi have rapidly expanded. More than ten villages, including Gengjiafen, Yangjiafen, Jingshi Temple, Xiaoyan Village, and Lanjiazhuang, have successively established home defense teams and self-defense teams, totaling approximately ××× people, who immediately took up weapons to stand guard, patrol, and check pedestrians. Their experience is: 1. The home defense team is composed of hired peasants and poor peasants as the backbone. The captain, deputy captain, and squad leaders of the Shijiazhuang Self-Defense Force are all from poor peasant backgrounds and are also active participants in the land reform. It is stipulated that those targeted for struggle are not allowed to join and must be subject to mass supervision in order to maintain ideological consistency of the class armed forces. Therefore, they are very active and responsible in standing guard and patrolling. On the 14th, large merchants Sun Hongfen, Wei Zhiren, and others were transporting coal to Yuncheng to support the enemy. They were immediately seized when they passed through the village. 2. Home defense covenants are formulated and observed by everyone in the village. Those of Shijiazhuang and Zhangcun are roughly the same and include the following items: (1) Strengthen sentry duty and patrol, check pedestrians, and resolutely prevent people without travel permits from passing. (2) Relatives, friends, and merchants must report their accommodation to the home defense team. (3) Those who conceal secret agents and those targeted for struggle without reporting will be treated as concealing secret agents once discovered. (4) Going out must be reported and a travel permit issued by the home defense team. (3) Strictly control local bullies, landlords, and all those targeted for struggle, and clearly state: "If a good person is killed in a village, the landlords and local bullies will be held responsible" as a warning. The Qicun home defense team even made the families of those targeted for struggle sign personal guarantees, not allowing them to engage in any sabotage activities.

　　安阳民兵积极活动
  　保卫秋收争立头功
    【本报安阳讯】安阳总结上月四号至十八号半月间游击战争，收获很大：共大小战斗五十六次，打死伤敌一百零五名，打死特务八名，俘敌六名，捉奸霸十一名，并缴获步枪、手枪、地雷等武器，打下了保卫秋收的基础，这一段斗争的特点是：一、在干部带头，在民兵区干队的积极活动下，打击敌抢粮抓丁与特务活动，掩护了边地村群众及时转移，边沿村一部村庄并自动组织起联防保丁队，和民兵在一齐杀敌，开展了边沿村群众的武装自卫斗争。二、有组织的组织了群众生产，在武装掩护下敌人抓丁到处扑空，并执行了联防公约，那里枪响，就往那里去支援，夜间巡逻禁用，小股出击活动，灵活宿营，使敌对我摸不着情况。三、民兵武工队积极响应保卫秋收，不让敌人抢走一颗粮的号召，在先立功立头功的口号下，我五区张有武工队，打响了第一炮，本月十七号夜，亲带十余民兵到敌后活捉刘乐仙二大队六中队部传令兵刘廷瑞等二人，缴手枪一支，步枪一支，截回走私人员二十余人。指挥部除通报表扬外，奖该队洋三千五百元，子弹一百粒。现这一运动仍在继续开展。（武委会通讯组）
    【本报太岳三日电】猗氏一区翻身武装，迅速扩大。现有耿家坟、杨家坟、景氏庙、小阎村、兰家庄等十余村，先后成立保家队、自卫队。共约×××人，立即拿起武器，站岗放哨，盘查行人，他们的经验是：一、翻身保家队，以雇贫为骨干，石家庄自卫队长、副队长、班长都是贫农成份，也是土改中的积极分子。规定斗争对象不准加入，并要受到群众监视，以保持阶级武装的思想一致。所以站岗放哨，都很积极负责。十四日，有大商人孙洪汾、卫治人等运炭往运城资敌，道经该村即被扣获。二、订出保家公约，全村人人遵守、石家庄、张村等，大致一样，有一下几项：（１）加强站岗放哨，盘查行人，坚决不叫没路条的人过去。（２）亲戚朋友，来往客商，住宿要向保家队报告。（３）暗藏特务及斗争对象不报告者，一经查出，以暗藏特务处理。（４）外出必须报告，并由保家队开给路条。（三）严厉控制奸霸地主，及一切斗争对象，明确提出：“那个村子杀害了好人，就由地主、奸霸负责”的警告。齐村翻身保家队，更让一家斗争地象立下人头保状，不允许他们有任何破坏活动。
