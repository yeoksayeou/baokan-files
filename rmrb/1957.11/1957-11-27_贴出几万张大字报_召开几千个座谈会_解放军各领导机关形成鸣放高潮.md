Xinhua News Agency, November 26th: The rectification movement in the leading organs of the General Headquarters and various services and arms of the Chinese People's Liberation Army has gradually formed a high tide of airing views and debates aimed at rectifying work style, improving work, and transforming ideology and enhancing awareness since it entered its third stage this month. Tens of thousands of big-character posters have been put up in office buildings and corridors of various organs. In these big-character posters and thousands of symposiums, the vast number of officers and soldiers have made sharp criticisms of leadership style and have also put forward various positive suggestions for future work.

In the airing of views and debates, most of the criticisms and opinions raised by officers and soldiers against leading organs and leading cadres are related to the three isms. According to statistics from the naval leadership organs, out of 30,800 opinions, only 563 were incorrect, and the vast majority were correct or basically correct. Among them, opinions related to leadership style, regulations and systems, professional work, and military construction planning accounted for 80% to 90%, and those related to living welfare accounted for about 10%.

In the airing of views, many organs have criticized the overstaffing and waste in some departments. While exposing shortcomings, many cadres have also put forward many beneficial suggestions. Ji Wenqi, director of the Equipment Division of the Production Department of the General Logistics Department, put forward a proposal for saving cotton in a big-character poster, using the scraps cut from the original white cloth to make "recycled cotton," which is mixed with new cotton for wadding, which can save 2,500 to 3,000 dan of cotton every year. The factories under the Production Department originally requested to add more than 2,000 machines in 1958. Now, after re-studying according to the spirit of rectification and reform, they can reduce 557 machines, saving 600,000 yuan.

During the airing of views and debates, many cadres, especially those of intellectual origin, also set off a wave of enthusiasm for requesting to be sent to lower levels for training in big-character posters. Big-character posters and resolutions demanding to go to the border areas, to the companies, to the countryside, to the production posts, and to the most difficult places have sprung up like mushrooms after a rain. 86% of the officers and salaried staff of the Finance Department of the General Logistics Department have signed up to go to the countryside and mountains to participate in agricultural production and training, and 158 people in the Barracks Management Department have written requests to be sent to lower levels.

The issue of mobilizing military officers' family members to return to their hometowns for production, employment, settling down, and participating in socialist construction has also formed a mass discussion in this airing of views and debates. Many officers and their families have warmly supported mobilizing family members to return to their hometowns for production in big-character posters.

In the rectification movement, the General Headquarters organs of the People's Liberation Army have always implemented the spirit of closely combining airing views and debates with rectification and reform. At present, for many reasonable and correct opinions raised by the masses, the general problems that can be corrected immediately have been corrected in batches by mobilizing the masses. For some major issues, as well as the transfer of cadres to lower levels, the return of family members to their hometowns, and building the army through diligence and thrift, the opinions are being sorted out, preparing to further launch a new upsurge of special airing of views and special debates.

    贴出几万张大字报　召开几千个座谈会
    解放军各领导机关形成鸣放高潮
    新华社26日讯　中国人民解放军各总部、各军种、兵种领导机关的整风运动，自本月间相继转入第三阶段以来，已经逐渐形成了一个以整顿作风、改进工作和改造思想、提高觉悟为目标的大鸣大放热潮。各个机关的办公楼里，走廊上，已经贴出了几万张大字报。广大官兵在这些大字报和几千个座谈会上，对领导作风等提出了尖锐的批评，并且对今后的工作也提出了各种积极的建议。
    在大鸣大放中，部队官兵对领导机关和领导干部提出的这些批评和意见，绝大部分都是有关三个主义的。据海军领导机关统计，在三万零八百条意见中，错误的只有五百六十三条，绝大多数都是正确或基本正确的。其中属于领导作风、条令制度、业务工作、建军规划等方面的意见达80％至90％，属于生活福利的约占10％。
    在鸣放中，许多机关都批评了一些部门的机构臃肿和浪费现象。不少干部还在揭露缺点的同时，提出了许多有益的建议。总后勤部生产部器材处处长纪文起在大字报上提出一项节约棉花的建议，用原白布剪裁下来的碎布弹制成“再生棉”，同新棉掺和用作棉絮，每年可以节约二千五百到三千担棉花。生产部所属各工厂，原来要求1958年增加机器两千多台，现在根据整改精神重新研究后，可以减少五百五十七台，节省开支六十万元。
    在鸣放中，许多机关干部特别是知识分子出身的干部，还在大字报上掀起了要求下放锻炼的热潮。要求到边疆去，到连队去，到农村去，到生产岗位上去，到最艰苦的地方去的大字报和决心书，犹如雨后春笋一般不断涌现出来。总后勤部财务部有86％的军官和工薪制职员报名要求下乡上山，到农业生产战线上去锻炼，营管部一百五十八人写了要求下放的请求书。
    动员随队军官家属还乡生产、劳动就业、安家落户、参加社会主义建设的问题，也在这次鸣放中形成了群众性的讨论的热潮。不少军官和家属在大字报上热烈拥护动员家属回乡生产。
    解放军总部各机关在整风运动中，始终贯彻着鸣放和整改紧密结合的精神。目前，对于群众提出的许多合理的正确的意见，能够立即改正的一般问题，马上分片分批地发动群众进行了改正，对于一些重大问题，以及干部下放，家属还乡，勤俭建军等问题，正在整理意见，准备进一步掀起一个专题鸣放和专题辩论的新的高潮。
