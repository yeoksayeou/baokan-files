Xinhua News Agency, Kunming Electric Dispatch: The Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture will become one of the cotton planting bases in the subtropical region of the Yunnan border. The Dehong Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China, based on local conditions, has formulated a plan for developing cotton production in the next ten years.

After studying the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft), the Dehong Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China held a meeting on the 11th and 12th to discuss issues related to the autonomous prefecture's agricultural development. The meeting decided to actively organize land reclamation for cotton planting under the condition of prioritizing grain production, requiring the cotton field area of the entire prefecture to reach 400,000 mu by 1967. At the time of liberation, the cotton field area of this autonomous prefecture was only more than 6,000 mu, and this year it has reached more than 60,000 mu.

In the river valley basins of the Nujiang River and Lancang River within the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture, the climate is hot. Here, the ratoon cotton, which can be harvested twice a year, has been successfully tested, and the yield can generally be increased by half.

In order to develop cotton production, the Dehong Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China recently dispatched a group of agricultural and water conservancy technicians to various places to conduct a comprehensive survey of the natural and socio-economic conditions of old cotton areas and suitable wasteland for cotton, including altitude, temperature, rainfall, water conservancy, soil, pests, and grain and cotton production. The survey found that there are large areas of wasteland that can be planted with cotton, most of which belong to the subtropical climate and can develop ratoon cotton, perennial cotton (planted once, harvested for years), and double-cropping cotton.

    在优先发展粮食生产的条件下
    德宏地区制订十年棉花生产规划
    据新华社昆明电　德宏傣族景颇族自治州将成为云南边疆亚热带地区的植棉基地之一。中共德宏地委根据当地情况，已经制订出今后十年内发展棉花生产的规划。
    中共德宏地委学习了全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）以后，在11、12两日举行会议，讨论了有关自治州农业发展的问题。会议决定在优先发展粮食生产的条件下，积极组织垦荒植棉的工作，要求到1967年全州的棉田面积达到四十万亩。这个自治州解放时的棉田面积只有六千多亩，今年已经达到六万多亩。
    在德宏傣族景颇族自治州境内的怒江、澜沧江的河谷盆地里，气候炎热，在这里，一年可以收获两次的再生棉已经试验成功，产量一般可以增加一半。
    为了发展棉花生产，中共德宏地委最近派出一批农业水利技术干部分赴各地，对老棉区和宜棉荒地的海拔、气温、雨量、水利、土壤、虫害、粮食和棉花的生产等自然和社会经济情况进行了全面的调查。调查结果发现，有大片荒地可以种植棉花，其中绝大部分属于亚热带气候，能发展再生棉、宿根棉（一年种，连年收摘）和双季棉。
