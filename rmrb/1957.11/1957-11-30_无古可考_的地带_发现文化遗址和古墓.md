    Areas "Beyond Historical Research"
    Discover Cultural Relics and Ancient Tombs
    Tianjin, being a coastal area, was previously considered a region "beyond historical research." However, since the Tianjin Municipal Bureau of Culture excavated a portion of the Warring States period tomb complex at the Clam Dike (蛤蜊堤) in Cuijia Wharf (崔家码头) in the eastern suburbs last December, this perception has begun to change. From April to August of this year, the Tianjin History Compilation Office successively discovered more than ten ancient cultural sites and ancient tombs.
    Those belonging to the Warring States period mainly include: the Shibalinzi (十八岭子) site and tombs near Balitai (八里台) in the western suburbs of Tianjin, and the Zhongtang (中塘) site and tombs in the southern suburbs. In addition to urn coffins and fragments, the unearthed pottery mainly consists of jars, urns, tripods (鼎), li (鬲, a type of ancient cooking pot), pots, and dou (豆, a type of stemmed dish). The vast majority of these are made of clayey gray pottery and sandy red pottery. In addition, there are a small number of knife coins and deer antlers.
    Those belonging to the Han Dynasty include the Chengdengzi (城顶子) site near Lao'an Store (老安店) in the fourth district of Ninghe County. Common pottery includes jars, urns, spinning wheels, and tiles. There are also some Wu Zhu coins.
    Those belonging to the Tang Dynasty include the stone coffin tomb in Junliangcheng (军粮城) in the sixth district of Ninghe County. More pottery figurines were unearthed from the tomb.
    In addition to investigating the sites and tombs, a preliminary survey of the Clam Dike was also conducted. It turns out that there are two Clam Dikes closest to the current coastline of Tianjin: the first starts from Tianzhuangzha (田庄垞) (16 kilometers north of Lutai) in Ninghe County, Hebei, passes through Cuijia Wharf, and ends at Dazhangmentou (大张门头) in Cang County in the south; the second starts from 3 kilometers north of Lutai, passes through Junliangcheng, and ends at Qikou (祁口) in Huanghua County in the south. Both are about 100 kilometers long. They are accumulations of clam shells and shell fragments mixed with silt and sand, elevated above the ground surface, and are likely to be the old coastlines of the Bohai Sea.
    The large number of discoveries of the above-mentioned sites, relics, and objects proves that human activity existed in the Tianjin area at least as early as the Warring States period. This will be of great help for further research on the history and geography of Tianjin in the future.

    “无古可考”的地带
    发现文化遗址和古墓
    天津由于是滨海地区，过去一直被人认为无古可考的地带。但是自从去年12月，天津市文化局在东郊崔家码头的蛤蜊堤，发掘了一部分战国墓葬群以后，开始改变了这种看法。今年4月至8月，天津史编纂室先后又发现了古文化遗址和古墓葬十余处。
    属于战国时代的，主要有：天津西郊区八里台附近的十八岭子遗址、墓葬，和南郊区的中塘遗址、墓葬。出土物除瓮棺、残片外，陶器以罐、瓮、鼎、鬲、壶、豆为大宗。它们的质地绝大多数是泥质灰陶和夹砂红陶。此外还有少量刀币、鹿角等物。
    属于汉代的，有宁河县四区老安店附近的城顶子遗址。常见的陶器计有罐、瓮、纺轮以及瓦当等。此外还有一些五铢钱。
    属于唐代的，有宁河县六区军粮城的石棺墓。墓里出陶俑较多。
    此外，在调查遗址和墓葬的同时，对蛤蜊堤也进行了初步的勘察。原来天津距现海岸最近的蛤蜊堤共有两道：第一道北起河北宁河县田庄垞（芦台北十六公里），中经崔家码头，南迄沧县的大张门头；第二道北起芦台以北三公里处，中经军粮城，南迄黄骅县的祁口。两道都长约一百公里。它们是由蛤蜊壳及壳的碎末混杂泥沙而成的高出地表的堆积，很可能都是渤海的旧岸。
    通过以上这些遗迹、遗物大量的发现，证明天津地区至少在战国时候已经有人类在活动，这对于今后进一步研究天津的历史和地理将有很大的帮助。
