Xinhua News Agency dispatch: West German Defense Minister Strauss announced at a press conference on November 15 that the West German army will be equipped with four types of rockets with atomic warheads, including a heavy missile and a missile equivalent to the American "Nike" missile.

Strauss said that the West German army will have 122,000 men by the end of this year, reaching the number stipulated by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. By the end of the year, the West German army will have three infantry divisions, two tank divisions, one mountain warfare division, and one airborne division, as well as other logistics units. The West German Air Force now has two large detachments of personnel, a transport aircraft fleet, and three military schools. The West German Navy now has a naval air force, three minesweeper detachments, and two fast ship detachments.

He said that West Germany urgently needs to establish more infantry divisions, tank divisions, jet fighter squadrons, and destroyer fleets in 1958.

Recently, the West German government's "Defense Committee" held secret meetings under the chairmanship of Prime Minister Adenauer to discuss the issue of West Germany manufacturing atomic weapons. The "Defense Committee" specifically discussed the preparations for the upcoming meeting of the heads of government of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries in Paris next month, as well as the prior talks between Adenauer and Macmillan in London.

At the same time, British and West German "arms experts" also held a "top secret" meeting in London on November 13 to formulate specific plans for the two countries to jointly research and manufacture weapons such as rockets, radar equipment, surface-to-air missiles, and air-to-air missiles.

According to Western news agencies, the upcoming meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the meeting of the prime ministers of Britain and West Germany will discuss the issue of West Germany manufacturing atomic weapons. West German political figures believe that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization summit is likely to abolish the provisions in the Paris Agreement and the Brussels Treaty that prohibit West Germany from manufacturing and using atomic weapons and long-range missiles.

There are reports that, according to an "understanding" between the United States and Britain, Britain and West Germany will conduct extensive "cooperation" in the research and manufacture of atomic rockets. Two mixed committees of British and West German experts have been studying this "cooperation" plan for several months.

    美英给老牌侵略者大开方便之门
    西德军国主义更猖狂
    军队将装备原子火箭并加紧策划制造核武器
    据新华社讯  西德国防部长施特劳斯11月15日在记者招待会上宣布：西德军队将要装备四种带原子弹头的火箭，包括一种重型的导弹和一种相当于美国“奈克式”导弹的导弹。
    施特劳斯说：西德军队将在今年年底有十二万二千人，达到北大西洋集团所规定的数字。西德陆军到年底将拥有三个步兵师、两个坦克师、一个山地作战师和一个空运师以及其他后勤部队。西德空军现在已经拥有两大队的人员、一个运输机队和三个军事学校。西德海军现在拥有一支海军航空队、三个扫雷舰分队和两个快舰分队。
    他说：西德在1958年里迫切需要再建立步兵师、坦克师、喷气战斗机队和驱逐舰队等。
    最近以来，西德政府的“国防委员会”在总理阿登纳主持下举行了秘密会议，讨论西德制造原子武器问题。“国防委员会”具体地讨论了有关下月在巴黎举行的北大西洋集团各国政府首脑会议以及阿登纳和麦克米伦将在伦敦举行的事先会谈的准备事项。
    同时，英国和西德的“军火专家”11月13日也在伦敦举行了“绝秘密”的会议，制订关于两国共同研究和制造火箭、雷达装备、地空导弹和空空导弹等武器的具体方案。
    据西方通讯社报道，北大西洋集团下月的会议以及英国西德两国总理会议都要讨论有关西德制造原子武器的问题。西德政界人士认为，北大西洋集团首脑会议很可能取消巴黎协定和布鲁塞尔条约中关于禁止西德制造和使用原子武器和远程导弹的规定。
    有消息说：根据美英两国之间的“谅解”，英国和西德将在研究和制造原子火箭方面进行广泛的“合作”。英国和西德专家的两个混合委员会几个月来一直在研究这种“合作”计划。
