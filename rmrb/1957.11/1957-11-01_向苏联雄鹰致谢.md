    A Salute to the Soviet Eagles
    Dear Comrade Grishchenko,

    I was overjoyed and excited to learn of your good health from the "People's Daily" article, "We Are Old Comrades." Your name and heroic deeds have long been known and admired by the people of our country. Twenty years ago, our motherland was in dire straits, and the survival of our nation was under serious threat. Half of our territory suffered the ravages of the Japanese invaders' guns. At that time, the Kuomintang traitor government adopted a policy of non-resistance, turning millions of our people into slaves of Japanese imperialism. However, the Chinese people would never yield. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, they carried out a heroic resistance. Did the United States, which called itself a "democratic" country, help us then? No! On the contrary, they supported Chiang Kai-shek in suppressing the anti-Japanese people! "A friend in need is a friend indeed," as a Chinese saying goes. The Soviet people and government extended a hand of friendship to the Chinese people, sending their finest sons and daughters to participate in the Chinese national liberation movement. The "Soviet Volunteer Air Force" severely dampened the arrogance of the Japanese invaders, giving China a chance to breathe. The Chinese people will never forget you.

    Dear Colonel, your and your comrades' blood and sweat were not shed in vain. The liberated Wuhan—the city you once defended—is now undergoing large-scale socialist construction. I am an aviation student, determined to build more, better, and faster aircraft for the motherland to defend our airspace, and never allow any aggressors to violate it again. In recent years, our aviation industry, like other construction projects, has received strong assistance from the Soviet Union and has developed rapidly. The Soviet Union is forever the faithful friend of the Chinese people. As the 40th anniversary of the Great October Revolution approaches, I salute you and, through you, the entire Soviet people, and offer my congratulations.

### 向苏联雄鹰致谢

    向苏联雄鹰致谢亲爱的格里申科同志：
    从“人民日报”上“我们是老战友”的通讯中，知道您很健康。我感到万分的高兴和激动。您的名字及荣誉的事迹已经早为我国人民所熟悉和敬佩。二十年前，我们的祖国处在水深火热之中，民族的存亡受到严重的威胁，大半个国土受着日本侵略者炮火的浩劫。当时蒋介石卖国政府却采取不抵抗主义，使我国千万人民沦为日本帝国主义的奴隶。然而中国人民是决不屈服的，他们在共产党的领导下进行了英勇的抵抗。当时号称“民主”国家的美国，帮助了我们没有？没有！相反，还支持蒋介石镇压抗日的人民！“患难见真情”这是一句中国的古话。苏联人民和政府向中国人民伸出了友谊的手，派遣了自己最优秀的子弟参加中国民族解放运动。“苏联志愿航空队”曾狠狠地抑挫了日本侵略者的气焰，替中国吐了一口气。中国人民永远不会忘记你们。
    亲爱的上校同志，您和同志们的血汗并没有白流。解放后的武汉——您曾经保卫过的城市现在正在进行着大规模的社会主义建设。我是一个学航空的学生，立志要为祖国制造出更多、更好、更快的飞机来保卫祖国的领空，再也不允许任何侵略者触犯它。几年来我们的航空事业和其他建设一样，受到苏联的大力帮助，得到迅速的发展。苏联永远是中国人民的忠实朋友。在伟大的十月革命四十周年即将到来的时候，我向您并通过您向全体苏联人民致敬和祝贺。
