Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 19th: People from all walks of life in Japan are universally condemning the pro-American behavior of the Maebashi District Court, which sentenced American murderer Girard to only three years in prison with a four-year suspended sentence on the 19th.

Inejiro Asanuma, Secretary-General of the Socialist Party, criticized that the verdict announced on the 19th against Girard only showed that Japan is not yet fully independent and that the Japanese court is weak towards the United States. He said that Japan is constrained by the "Security Treaty" concluded with the United States.

The victim's daughter, Kayoko Sakai, expressed strong dissatisfaction with the verdict on the 19th. She said, "A suspended sentence is equivalent to a not-guilty verdict."

The Japan National Liaison Council Against Military Bases sent representatives to Tokyo High Public Prosecutors Office Chief Prosecutor Tadashi Hanai on the 19th to protest the "excessive leniency" towards Girard. The representatives demanded that Hanai prosecute Girard in order to give him a severe sentence.

The Soumagahara Base Countermeasures Committee, composed of local organizations of the Japanese Communist Party and Socialist Party in Gunma Prefecture and other groups, held an emergency meeting of leaders on the afternoon of the 19th, and decided to protest to the Presiding Judge of the Maebashi District Court, Yuzo Kawauchi, and demand that the Maebashi District Public Prosecutors Office immediately decide on an appeal policy. The meeting pointed out that the verdict against Girard was a politically motivated verdict.

Iimoto, Director of the Public Security Department of the Supreme Public Prosecutors Office, said that as the prosecution, they hoped that Girard would be sentenced to five years in prison as requested by the prosecution authorities. Whether the prosecution will appeal is still under discussion.

Meanwhile, according to reports from the United States, American officials expressed satisfaction with the Japanese judicial authorities' verdict on Girard. They believe that the Japanese court's verdict is "fair."

Xinhua News Agency, 20th: The Standing Executive Committee of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party issued a statement protesting the Japanese court's lenient sentence on American murderer Girard.

The statement, published in the "Akahata" on the 20th, pointed out: This is a verdict that no Japanese person can accept and that shames the nation. This verdict is a play staged by the Kishi Nobusuke government to appease the Japanese people while surrendering to the strong intervention of American imperialism.

In its statement, the Japanese Communist Party called on the Japanese people to launch a mass protest movement, and called on the public to investigate the responsibility of the Kishi Nobusuke government for making this verdict, expose the truth of the government's traitorous policies, abolish the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and the Japan-U.S. "Administrative Agreement" that form the basis of this verdict, and shatter the San Francisco Treaty system.

The Japanese Socialist Party issued a statement on the 20th, pointing out that this verdict is in fact equivalent to a verdict of not guilty, and is a politically motivated verdict that disregards the feelings of the Japanese people. This will have a negative impact on the handling of similar incidents in the future, and there is a danger of a second Girard incident occurring. The statement said that in order to fundamentally eliminate such tragedies, we emphasize the need to withdraw American troops from Japan and remove American military bases in Japan.

Kiyoshi Kanzaki, Vice Chairman of the Japan Association for the Protection of Children, told an "Akahata" reporter that it is only natural that all Japanese people are dissatisfied with this verdict. This is an international drama staged according to the Japan-U.S. Joint Communiqué issued by Prime Minister Kishi Nobusuke. However, the Japanese people should not ignore this humiliating drama. The American soldier who shot and killed a Japanese farmer must be given the national punishment he deserves.

Masaru Nomizo, Chairman of the Japan National Liaison Council Against Military Bases, said: This verdict exposes the truth of the "complete independence" claimed by the Japanese government. The Japanese people must recognize the essence of this ambiguous independence and rise up to fight for true and complete independence. The Japan National Liaison Council Against Military Bases also sent representatives to the Supreme Public Prosecutors Office today, demanding that Girard be prosecuted in order to give him a heavier sentence.

Japanese newspapers on the 20th universally criticized the Maebashi District Court for giving Girard too light a sentence.

    日本法院媚美行为激起举国公愤
    日共号召人民起来展开抗议运动
    浅沼说对哲腊德的判决表明日本没有完全独立
    据新华社19日讯　东京消息：日本各界人士普遍地谴责前桥地方裁判所19日对美国杀人犯哲腊德只判决三年徒刑并且缓刑四年的媚美行为。
    社会党书记长浅沼稻次郎指责说，19日宣布的对哲腊德的判决只是表明了日本还没有完全独立，它完全表明日本法院对美国是软弱的。他说，由于同美国缔结“安全条约”，日本受到了约束。
    被害者的女儿坂井佳代子对于19日的判决表示强烈的不满。她说：“缓期执行判决就等于一个无罪的判决”。
    日本全国反对军事基地联络会议19日派代表向东京高等检察厅检事长花井忠表示抗议对哲腊德的“过分宽大”。代表们要求花井忠对哲腊德起诉，以便给予哲腊德严厉的判处。
    由群马县的日本共产党、社会党地方组织和其他团体组成的相马原基地对策委员会，19日下午举行领导人紧急会议，决定对前桥地方裁判所裁判长河内雄三提出抗议，并且要求前桥地方检察厅立刻决定上诉方针。会议指出，对哲腊德的判决是有政治意图的判决。
    日本最高检察厅公安部长井本说，作为检察方面，希望能够按照检察当局所要求的对哲腊德判处五年徒刑。检察方面是否上诉，还有待于磋商。
    同时，据来自美国的消息报道，美国官方人士对日本司法当局对哲腊德的判决表示满意。他们认为，日本法院的判决是“公正的”。
    据新华社20日讯　日本共产党中央委员会常任干部会发表声明，抗议日本法院对美国杀人犯哲腊德的从轻判决。
    这个发表在20日的“赤旗报”上的声明指出：这是任何一个日本人都不能承认的使国家蒙受耻辱的判决。这个判决是岸信介政府一方面屈服于美帝国主义的强力干涉，另一方面为了蒙蔽日本人民的眼睛而演出的一出戏。
    日本共产党在声明中号召日本人民展开群众性的抗议运动，并且呼吁公众追究岸信介政府作出这个判决的责任，揭露政府的卖国政策的真相；废除成为这种判决的根据的日美“安全条约”和日美“行政协定”，粉碎旧金山和约体制。
    日本社会党20日发表声明指出，这一判决事实上等于判决无罪，是不顾日本国民感情的有政治意图的判决。这样将会给今后对同样事件的处理带来恶劣的影响，并且有发生第二个哲腊德事件的危险。声明说，为了从根本上消灭这样的悲剧，我们强调要从日本撤走美国军队，并且撤除美国在日本的军事基地。
    日本保卫儿童会副会长神崎清对“赤旗报”记者发表谈话说，全体日本国民对这个判决表示不满是理所当然的。这正是根据岸信介首相发表的日美联合公报所演出的国际性的戏剧。但是，日本国民不应该忽视这出屈辱性质的戏剧。必须给枪杀日本农妇的美国兵以应有的民族的制裁。
    日本全国反对军事基地联络会议委员长野沟胜说：这个判决正好暴露了日本政府所说的“完全独立”的真相。日本国民必须认识到这种含混的独立的实质，奋起争取真正的完全独立。日本全国反对军事基地联络会议今天还派代表到最高检察厅，要求对哲腊德起诉，以便给予哲腊德以更重的判处。
    日本报纸20日普遍指责前桥地方裁判所对哲腊德的判处太轻。
