To Guarantee a Large Increase in Agricultural Production
Jiangxi Continues to Promote the "Three Changes"

(Our Nanchang dispatch) In accordance with the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and the National Agricultural Development Program, Jiangxi Province continues to vigorously promote the "three changes" to increase production: changing single-season rice into double-season rice (including mid-season rice into early-season rice), dry land into paddy fields, and barren land into cultivated land. By 1967, the province will basically become a double-season rice province.

Past five years of experience have proven that the "three changes" are an effective way for Jiangxi Province to increase grain production. From 1953 to 1957, the area of double-season rice expanded from 4.5 million mu in 1953 to more than 8 million mu (in addition, 2.09 million mu of mid-season rice were converted to early-season rice), 740,000 mu of dry land were converted to paddy fields, and 1.44 million mu of barren land were converted to cultivated land. Due to the gradual expansion of the replanting area and the gradual increase in unit area yield, this year the province's total grain output reached about 14 billion jin, based on the 7.75 billion jin in 1949. Among them, the promotion of the "three changes" alone increased rice production by nearly 3.4 billion jin. At present, the potential for the "three changes" in the province is still very large. The Provincial Party Committee requires that in the next ten years, 19 million mu of single-season rice fields be converted into double-season rice in a planned and phased manner. By 1967, the province's double-season rice area will increase from the existing 8 million mu to 27 million mu, accounting for 75% of the paddy field cultivated area. By 1967, the province's cultivated land area will expand from the existing 42.2 million mu to 56 million mu. If the above plan can be fully realized, the province's total grain output can reach 34 billion jin by 1967. In this way, we will be confident to complete and exceed the requirement of 800 jin per mu.

Is it possible to continue promoting the "three changes" throughout the province? According to the materials from Pingxiang, Nankang, Xingzi, Lianhua, Shangyou, Yongxin, Xinfeng and other counties, it is entirely possible as long as water conservancy, fertilizer and labor issues are properly resolved. For example, the double-season rice area in Pingxiang County has reached 84.7%, Nankang County 75.5%, and Xingzi County 70%. However, at present, the proportion of double-season rice area to paddy field area in a considerable number of counties in the province is relatively small. For example, the double-season rice area in Yongfeng, Fengcheng, Ji'an and other counties only accounts for 4% to 9% of the paddy field area.

In order to create conditions for vigorously promoting the "three changes", the Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee decided to expand the irrigated area by 1.7 million mu and improve the irrigated area by 2.5 million mu in 1958, and strive to exceed it. Another important measure is to mobilize the masses to accumulate and create fertilizers in large quantities. It is required to accumulate farmyard manure in large quantities; greatly expand the green manure area and increase the unit area yield of green manure; seize the construction of chemical fertilizer plants and greatly increase chemical fertilizers; and mobilize the masses to accumulate natural fertilizers in large quantities. It is required that each mu of double-season rice field be applied with 70 to 80 dan of standard fertilizer in 1958, and each mu of single-season rice field be applied with 50 dan of standard fertilizer.

In addition, we must also take immigration measures to overcome the difficulty of labor shortage in areas with few people and more land; vigorously promote various advanced production experiences and effective measures to increase production.

### 保证农业大量增产  江西继续推行“三变”

    保证农业大量增产
    江西继续推行“三变”
    本报南昌电  江西省根据党八届三中全会精神和全国农业发展纲要的精神，继续大力推行一季稻变双季稻（包括中稻变早稻）、旱地变水田、荒地变熟地的“三变”的增产措施，到1967年这个省将基本上成为双季稻省。
    过去五年的经验证明：“三变”是江西省粮食增产的有效办法。自1953年到1957年五年间，双季稻由1953年的四百五十万亩，扩大到八百多万亩（此外，中稻变早稻二百零九万亩），旱地变水田七十四万亩，荒地变熟地一百四十四万亩。由于复种面积逐年扩大，单位面积产量逐年提高，今年全省粮食总产量在1949年七十七亿五千斤的基础上，达到一百四十亿斤左右。其中，仅仅由于推行“三变”，就增产了稻谷将近三十四亿斤。现在全省“三变”的潜力还很大。省委要求在今后十年内有计划地分期分批地将一千九百万亩一季稻田变为双季稻。到1967年，全省双季稻面积将从现有的八百万亩增加到二千七百万亩，占水稻田耕地面积的75％。到1967年全省耕地面积从现有四千二百二十万亩扩大到五千六百万亩。如能完全实现以上计划，到1967年全省粮食总产量可以达到三百四十亿斤。这样，就有把握完成和超额完成每亩产量八百斤的要求。
    能不能在全省继续推行“三变”呢？根据萍乡、南康、星子、莲花、上犹、永新、信丰等县的材料，只要适当解决水利、肥料和劳动力等问题，是完全有可能的。例如萍乡县双季稻面积已达到84．7％，南康县75．5％，星子县70％。但是，目前全省相当一部分县双季稻面积占水稻田面积的比例是较少的。如永丰、丰城、吉安等县双季稻的面积，只占水稻田面积的4％到9％。
    为了给大力推行“三变”创造条件，江西省委决定在1958年扩大灌溉面积一百七十万亩，改善灌溉面积二百五十万亩，并大力争取超过。另一重要措施是发动群众大量积肥造肥。要求大量积蓄农家肥料；大量扩大绿肥面积，提高绿肥单位面积产量；抓紧建设化学肥料厂，大量增加化学肥料；发动群众大量积蓄自然肥料。要求1958年双季稻田每亩施标准肥七十到八十担，单季稻田每亩施标准肥五十担。
    此外，还要采取移民办法，克服人少田多的地区的缺少劳动力的困难；大力推行各种先进生产经验和有效增产措施。
