    Brushing Teeth
    Eight years ago, when I was studying in middle school, during vacation back home, out of the twenty-odd households in the front and back courtyards, I was the only one who had the habit of brushing my teeth. This really embarrassed me. As soon as I picked up my rinsing cup, children from all over would crowd around, as if watching a street performance, making me feel very awkward. I had to rush through it, brushing carelessly. This year, I returned to my hometown. On the first morning, I was still in bed, and the people in the front and back courtyards were already up. They were all brushing their teeth. The sound of toothbrushes dipped in tooth mugs washing back and forth, "qihua! qihua!" woke me up. Getting up, I saw, "Ah! Everyone's brushing their teeth!" Suddenly, I was reminded of the embarrassing scene of me brushing my teeth here eight years ago.

    刷牙
    八年前我在中学读书，放假回家，前后院二十多户人家，只有我一个人有刷牙的习惯。这可把我难住了，一拿起漱口缸，前前后后的小孩都拥了来，好像看耍把戏似的，使我感到很不好意思，只得慌慌张张，马马虎虎，刷一刷就算了。今年我回到家乡，第一个早晨，我还睡在床上，前后院的人都起来了。他们都在刷牙，牙刷浸在牙罐里洗打得“启哗！启哗”地响把我惊醒了，起身一看，“啊！都在刷牙哩！”猛然使我想起了八年前我在这里刷牙的狼狈像。
