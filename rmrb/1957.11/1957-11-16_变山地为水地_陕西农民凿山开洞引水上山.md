Transforming Mountainous Land into Irrigated Land
Shaanxi Farmers Carve Through Mountains and Open Caves to Draw Water Up the Mountains

Editor's Note: Bringing water to high plateaus and transforming mountainous land into irrigated land is a very important and arduous task in the current water conservancy construction. It is easier to turn plains into irrigated land, there is more experience, and the amount of irrigated land in the plains is very large. In many places, there is even more irrigated land than dry land. However, to turn high plateaus and high mountains into irrigated land, the area requiring irrigation is large, the amount of water is also large, the conditions are much more difficult, and there is less experience.

The experience of Shaanxi Province in drawing water to the plateaus is very valuable. What is valuable is that the "Two Immortals Passing on the Way," "Three Immortals Passing on the Way," and even "Four Immortals Passing on the Way" methods created by the masses are not only easier than using water pumps to pump water to high ground, but also easier than drilling deep wells to obtain water. What is valuable is that the collectivized masses have fully exerted the collective strength. If one cooperative cannot handle a project, several cooperatives can join together to handle it. If the strength of the masses in areas that can be irrigated is insufficient, the masses in areas that cannot be irrigated are also mobilized to provide support, and the supported masses will repay the labor in the future.

What is even more valuable is that it costs little money and does not require state investment. An eight-mile-long tunnel canal irrigates more than 3,300 mu of land and costs only 100 yuan, excluding the use of existing waterwheels. When many people talk about building water conservancy projects in high plateaus and high mountains, they think of building large canals, using water pumps, and using portable steam engines, only hoping that the state will invest money. In contrast, the spirit of Shaanxi in building water conservancy projects diligently and thriftily is even more worthy of learning.

(Xinhua News Agency report) Reporter Zhu Bo reports: Shaanxi farmers, with high production enthusiasm, have created great achievements in the water conservancy construction movement. From the beginning of October to November 10, according to incomplete statistics, the province expanded the irrigated area by more than 776,000 mu. In this water conservancy construction movement, the broad masses of farmers created valuable experience in drawing water to the plateaus and drawing water to the mountains.

Before the end of October, all counties in Shaanxi held three-level cadre meetings and rural work meetings centered on water conservancy. At these meetings, a general debate was launched on water conservancy construction issues. Many counties have repeatedly broken through the water conservancy plan indicators assigned by the provincial leadership. Fuping County originally planned to expand the irrigated area by 50,000 mu, but later, the Meiyuan District of the county proposed to complete 60,000 mu of expansion irrigation this winter. Subsequently, the county leaders re-evaluated the water conservancy construction plan based on the situation in each district and raised it to 150,000 mu. Now, the province has generally formed a situation where the water conservancy plans ordered by the agricultural cooperatives are larger than the counties, the counties are larger than the special zones, and the special zones are larger than the province. According to the leading comrades of Shaanxi Province, the original plan to complete 2.5 million mu of water conservancy this winter and next spring will be overfulfilled this winter.

"Drawing water to the plateaus and drawing water to the mountains" is the loudest slogan in the current water conservancy construction movement, and it is also the most prominent feature of this water conservancy movement. According to statistics before the end of September, there were 23 large-scale state-owned canals in the province, irrigating a total of more than 3.13 million mu, and small-scale canals in the province irrigated a total of more than 4.5 million mu, and well-irrigated land totaled more than 2.2 million mu. Most of these irrigated areas are in the plains, accounting for more than 66% of the cultivated land area in the plains (the province has a total of 14.8 million mu), and many counties have basically turned the plains into irrigated land. However, the high plateau land (a total of 18 million mu) and mountainous land (a total of 34.2 million mu), which are more than three times larger than the plains in Shaanxi, have very little water conservancy construction. Therefore, this large-scale water conservancy construction movement has focused on high plateaus and mountainous areas.

At present, farmers in various places are actively taking action to advance towards dry plateaus and mountainous areas. Xingping County has started water conservancy construction throughout the county to "draw water to the plateaus, draw water to the slopes, and draw water to the mounds." For example, the Shipu Agricultural Cooperative in Xiwu Township recently completed 320 mu of irrigated land, which people previously thought could not be changed from dry plateau. Their method is to dig open ditches and underground caves to draw the canal water to the bottom of the dry plateau, and then dig a dry well from the plateau and connect it to the bottom, and put on a waterwheel to draw the canal water to the high plateau. When encountering a higher dry plateau, you can use the method of digging earthen wells layer by layer and putting on waterwheels to draw the water to the plateau land like climbing stairs. The masses call this method of drawing water "Two Immortals Passing on the Way" or "Three Immortals Passing on the Way" or even "Four Immortals Passing on the Way." The farmers of Wugong County used the method of digging underground caves and repairing dry wells to draw available river water, canal water, and well water to dry plateaus more than ten zhang high. The experience of Youfeng Township is particularly worthy of attention. Youfeng Township is a place with high plateaus, deep gullies, and crisscrossing ravines, and the conditions for water conservancy construction are very difficult. The Qixin, Fengbei, Sanyou, Wuyi, and other cooperatives in this township, with the support of the Sanxing, Wuxin, and Xinong cooperatives, used 4,440 labor days and 17 days to build a mountain-piercing canal that is eight li long, which can irrigate more than 3,360 mu of land (including 1,600 mu of well-irrigated land converted into gravity-fed land). The construction of this canal was very difficult. The canal had to cross gullies and pass through a dry plateau more than ten zhang high and more than three li long. The masses dug caves to allow the canal to pass under the plateau. Because there was no precise design, people adopted the method of opening up in sections, first digging 59 dry wells to penetrate the three-li-long high plateau. In the future, the "Three Immortals Passing on the Way" and "Four Immortals Passing on the Way" methods can also be used to draw the canal water to the top of the plateau to irrigate more land. This township plans to build a 30-li-long canal this winter that can irrigate more than 7,000 mu of land. After this canal is completed, the township will have more than 11,000 mu of irrigated land (including the original irrigated land), with an average of more than 1.5 mu of irrigated land per person in the township.

In the Shangluo, Hanzhong, and Ankang special zones, the masses built irrigated land on high mountains. Farmers in Yongfeng District of Zhen'an County built a small reservoir on Putao Ridge in the Qinling Mountains to store the water flowing down from the top of the mountain. They are now chiseling stones and filling valleys in the mountains of Putao Ridge to build a canal that can irrigate 5,000 mu. The Baiyuan Agricultural Cooperative in this county is often threatened by drought. To dig wells, the groundwater level is too deep, and there is no water source for repairing canals. In the event of drought, even drinking water for people is very scarce. Local people say that this place is "nine years out of ten are bad harvests, at most three dou of wheat, rice cannot be planted, and corn is as thick as a finger." However, the masses still came up with a solution. They used the method of building waterlogged ponds to store rainwater and turn dry plateaus into irrigated land. Now the cooperative has 17 waterlogged ponds (including those built last year), irrigating more than 400 mu of land. At present, the masses in the whole cooperative said that they must change the dry plateau land here into a place where "only the croaking of frogs can be heard, and the crying of children cannot be heard (referring to starvation in famine years)."

In the water conservancy construction movement, all localities have paid attention to fully mobilizing the masses and relying on the strength of the masses to solve various difficult problems in water conservancy construction. Experience has proved that in places where the masses are mobilized relatively well and can resolutely rely on the collective strength of the masses, the methods, investment, and labor force for water conservancy construction can be solved, and the progress of the project can be accelerated and the quality of water conservancy construction can be improved. For example, the Youfeng Canal in Youfeng Township, Wugong County, is a high-quality canal built by the township party committee completely relying on the masses. The method of construction was discussed by the masses; in addition to the four cooperatives benefiting, the labor force also mobilized members of three other cooperatives to provide support; the tools were brought by the masses themselves, and the eight-li-long mountain-piercing canal cost 100 yuan in funds (used to buy lamp oil and medicine). Not a penny was asked from the state. This example is not an isolated case and can be seen everywhere along the Wei River and in the Qinling Mountains. Whether they are digging wells or repairing canals, agricultural cooperatives in various places carefully calculate the accounts to see how it is cost-effective. Small-scale water conservancy projects built by relying on the masses are all relatively low in cost. The cost per mu of plateau irrigated land irrigated by buying waterwheels and repairing dry wells in Xingping County and Wugong County is only about four or five yuan.

    变山地为水地
    陕西农民凿山开洞引水上山
    编者按　引水上高塬，变山地为水地，是当前水利建设中十分重要也是十分艰巨的任务。使平川地变成水地或水浇地，条件好，经验多，平川中水地的数量也很大，有不少地方甚至水地多于旱地。但是要使高塬和高山变为水地，需要灌溉的面积大，水量也大，条件就困难得多，经验也少。
    陕西地区引水上塬的经验是十分可贵的。可贵的是，群众创造的那些“二仙传道”、“三仙传道”甚至“四仙传道”的土办法，不仅比用抽水机抽水上高地容易，比打深井取水也容易得多。可贵的是，合作化了的群众，充分发挥了集体力量，一个社办不了的工程就几个社联合起来办，能受水灌溉地区的群众力量不够，还动员不能受水灌溉地区的群众来支援，被支援的群众将来再还工。
    更可贵的是，花钱少，不要国家投资。一条八里长的穿山水渠，灌溉三千三百多亩地，除使用原有的水车以外，才花一百元钱。很多人一说在高塬高山兴修水利，就想到修大型水渠、用抽水机、用锅驼机，只盼着国家拿钱投资，相形之下，陕西勤俭办水利的精神就更值得学习。
    本报讯　记者朱波报道：生产热情高涨的陕西农民，在兴修水利运动中创造了巨大成绩。从10月初到11月10日，根据不完全统计，全省就扩大了七十七万六千多亩灌溉面积。广大农民在这次水利建设运动中，在引水上塬、引水上山方面创造了宝贵的经验。
    陕西各县在10月底以前都召开了以水利为中心内容的三级干部会和农村工作会议。在这些会上，一般地都对水利建设问题展开了大辩论。很多县都一再突破省的领导方面分配的水利计划指标。富平县原计划扩大灌溉面积五万亩，到后来，这个县的美原区一个区就提出今冬完成六万亩的扩灌计划。随后，县领导上又重新根据各区情况，把水利建设计划提高到十五万亩。现在，全省普遍地形成农业社订的水利计划比县大、县比专区大、专区比省大的情况。据陕西省的领导同志说，原计划在今冬明春完成的二百五十万亩水利计划，今冬就会超额完成。
      “引水上塬，引水上山”，这是目前水利建设运动中最响亮的口号，也是这次水利运动的突出特点。据9月底以前的统计，全省共有大型国营渠道二十三处，共灌溉三百一十三万多亩，全省的小型渠道共灌溉四百五十多万亩，井浇地共二百二十多万亩。这些水地绝大部分在平川地，约占平川地区耕地面积（全省共有一千四百八十万亩）66％以上，并且已经有很多县的平川地基本上变成了水地。但是，全陕西比平川地面积多三倍以上的高塬地（共一千八百万亩）、山地（共三千四百二十万亩），却很少兴修水利。因此，这次大规模的水利建设运动，就把重点放在高塬和山区。
    目前，各地农民正积极行动起来，向旱塬和山地进军。兴平县在全县范围内开始了“引水上塬、引水上坡、引水上包（土圪瘩）”的水利建设。例如西吴乡的石铺农业社最近完成了三百二十亩水地，都是以往人们认为无法改变的旱塬。他们的办法是挖明沟和地洞，把渠水引到旱塬底下，再从塬上打一个旱井和下边接连上，架上水车，就把渠水引上了高塬。遇到较高的旱塬，可以采用层层挖土井，架水车的办法，像上楼梯一样地把水引上塬地。群众叫这种引水方法为“二仙传道”或“三仙传道”甚至“四仙传道”。武功县的农民用打地洞、修旱井的办法把可以利用的河水、渠水和井水，引上十多丈高的旱塬。游凤乡的经验特别值得重视。游凤乡是一个塬高沟深，沟壑纵横的地方，兴修水利的条件十分困难。这个乡的齐心、风北、三友、五一等社，在三星、五新和新农等社支援下，用了四千四百四十个劳动日和十七天的时间，修成了一条长达八里的穿山水渠，可灌溉三千三百六十多亩土地（内有一千六百亩井浇地改为自流地）。这条渠修建工程是非常困难的。渠道要跨过沟壑，穿过三里多长十多丈高的旱塬，群众挖洞使水渠从塬下穿过去。因为没有精确的设计，人们就采取分段打通的办法，先打了五十九眼旱井，把三里长的高塬挖透了。以后，还可以采用“三仙传道”、“四仙传道”的方法，把渠水引上塬顶，灌溉更多的土地。这个乡今冬还要修建一条长达三十里，能灌溉七千多亩土地的水渠。等到修好这道渠后，全乡共有水地一万一千多亩（包括原有水地），全乡每人平均有一亩半多水地。
    在商?、汉中、安康等专区，群众把水地修上了高山，?南县永丰区的农民在秦岭山脉的葡萄岭修了一个小型水库，把山顶流下来的水储存起来，现在正在葡萄岭的山丛中凿石填谷，修一条可灌溉五千亩的渠道。这个县的白垣农业社，经常遭受旱灾的威胁。要打井，地下水位太深，修渠又没有水源，逢到天旱时，连人吃的水都非常缺乏。当地群众说这里是“十年九不收，顶多麦三斗，稻子栽不上，包谷指头粗”。但是，群众仍然想出了办法。他们用修涝池的办法储存雨水，把旱塬改为水地。现在该社已经有十七个涝池（包括去年修的），共浇四百多亩地。目前，全社群众说，一定要把这里的旱塬地改变为“只听到青蛙叫，听不到娃娃哭（指灾荒年饿的哭）”的地方。
    在兴修水利运动中，各地都注意充分发动群众，依靠群众的力量，来解决兴修水利中的各种困难问题。经验证明，凡是群众发动比较好，并能坚决依靠群众的集体力量的地方，水利建设的方法、投资、劳力等问题都能得到解决，并且还加快了工程的进度，提高了水利建设的质量。例如武功县游凤乡的友丰渠，就是乡党委会完全依靠群众建起来的一条质量很好的水渠。修建的办法是群众讨论出来的；劳动力除受益的四个社负担外，还发动另外三个社的社员来支援；工具是群众自己带来的，一条八里长的穿山大渠口用一百元资金（买灯油和药品用）。没有向国家要一个钱。这种范例不是个别的，在渭河沿岸，在秦岭山区，随处都可以看到。各地农业社无论打井、修渠，都要仔细算一下账，看看怎样作才合算。凡是依靠群众搞起来的小型水利，成本都比较低。兴平县、武功县买水车、修旱井来灌溉的塬上水地，每亩成本只有四、五元左右。
