    The Characteristics of the Current Sterling Market
    The misalignment of exchange rates among Western European countries has taken a turn for the worse in recent months. The central problem is that the West German mark is too "hard," while the British pound and the French franc are too "soft." In the monthly clearing of the European Payments Union, West Germany's surplus continues to expand, while the deficits of Britain and France are growing larger. For a long time, the market has been rife with rumors of the mark appreciating and the pound and franc depreciating. After France announced the actual devaluation of the franc on August 10 under the guise of adjusting foreign exchange controls, the pound was under tremendous pressure. Large amounts of pounds were converted into marks, dollars, and other currencies in the market, and the official exchange rate of the pound fell to the official minimum. In August and September, the sterling area's gold and dollar reserves lost more than $500 million, falling to $1.85 billion at the end of September.
    The current weakness of the pound and the outflow of reserves are not due to a deficit in Britain's current account balance of payments, but rather to a lack of confidence in the pound in the international market, which has led to the conversion of existing sterling funds into foreign currencies. This kind of selling of sterling funds has been going on for a long time, especially since Britain's fourth post-war balance of payments crisis in 1955. Speculation about the devaluation of the pound has appeared from time to time in the market, and any slight disturbance can trigger a sell-off of the pound. In 1956, Britain's balance of payments turned positive, with a surplus of more than $80 million for the entire sterling area, but the outflow of funds did not stop. After the Suez Canal crisis, it became even more unmanageable. If the British government's borrowings and special income from the sale of oil companies, etc., are not included, the actual loss of reserves for the whole year amounted to more than $600 million. The actual loss of reserves from January to September this year was also more than $600 million. The fact that the pound is still vulnerable despite a stable balance of payments fully illustrates that the pound's crisis has deep roots.
    The fragility of the pound is a concrete reflection in the foreign exchange market of the deep contradictions in British imperialist economy.

    Why is the pound so fragile?
    In 1956, the British government publicly stated that striving for a surplus of 300 to 350 million pounds in the current account balance of payments each year is the primary task of Britain's current economic policy. This is because British monopoly capital, in order to expand overseas investment to strengthen control over the increasingly disintegrating "British Empire," increase reserves to consolidate the sterling market, and repay foreign debts, requires the above-mentioned surplus as a minimum. In the past two years, the British government has tried every means to compress domestic consumption, and has also restricted domestic investment and cut government spending, in order to increase exports and reduce imports. However, the surplus obtained in 1956 was only 233.3 million pounds, and this year it is estimated to be only 180 million pounds. If the required surplus cannot always be obtained in the future, expenditures for overseas investment and debt repayment can only rely on the use of reserves, and the future of the pound can only be even more bleak.
    Why is the need for a balance of payments surplus so pressing for British monopoly capital today?
    Since the end of the war, Britain has never achieved a sufficient surplus in its current account balance of payments. However, in the past, 150 to 200 million pounds of long-term capital were still invested overseas each year (mostly in the overseas sterling area), and some debts have been repaid in recent years, and a certain, albeit very low, level of reserves has also been maintained. The main reasons are: in the early post-war years, Britain obtained huge amounts of U.S. "aid" under exploitative conditions; since 1950, U.S. "aid" has gradually decreased, but the funds deposited in London by the colonies have grown rapidly, providing Britain with another special source of funds.
    As the financial center of the sterling area, London regularly holds a large amount of sterling deposits from overseas (commonly known as "sterling debt" or "sterling balances"). Since the end of the war, British monopoly capital has tried its best to maintain and expand the amount of sterling balances. At the end of 1956, these sterling balances from overseas totaled more than 3.4 billion pounds, of which nearly 2.9 billion pounds belonged to the overseas sterling area. Of the balances in the overseas sterling area, the portion belonging to the sterling area countries (totaling 1.574 billion pounds at the end of 1956) has been frequently withdrawn and deposited in recent years, and has decreased by 30 million pounds in the six years from 1950 to 1955.
    Only the balances of the colonies have been growing continuously (totaling 1.286 billion pounds at the end of 1956). In the six years from 1950 to 1955, Britain exported 775 million pounds of capital to the overseas sterling area; while the balances of the colonies increased by 650 million pounds, providing more than 80% of the source of funds.
    However, as of today, the historical trend of colonial independence has made this special source of funds difficult to continue. Ghana and Malaya have successively become independent, and other colonies (such as Nigeria) are also gradually moving towards independence. After that, they will not only find it difficult to supply new funds to Britain, but will also withdraw their original deposits for their own national construction like India today. What is especially important is that Malaya and Ghana were the main sources of colonial sterling deposits after the war. In the six years from 1949 to 1955, 47% of the funds deposited in London by the colonies came from British West Africa (mainly Ghana and Nigeria), and 40% came from Malaya. At the end of 1956, 60% of Britain's total debt to the colonies belonged to these two regions.
    In this case, British monopoly capital, while preparing to cope with the withdrawal of sterling balances, and also wanting to further expand its overseas investment, has to loudly call for "using Britain's own strength" to pay for the expanded foreign expenditures.
    So, what factors are hindering the acquisition of this surplus?
    Although Britain has cut some military spending this year, it is still burdened with a heavy burden of 1.4 billion pounds a year on the British economy. Military production has increased the need for imports, weakened the ability to export, and at the same time, it is easy to cause tension in the domestic supply of goods and raise prices. Therefore, Britain's economic situation has always been stretched and embarrassed in recent years. Since the second half of 1953, domestic fixed capital investment in Britain has expanded, and production and employment have grown. As a result, raw material imports have increased greatly, but exports have not been able to expand accordingly, and a balance of payments crisis occurred in 1955. In order to save the crisis and strive for a surplus, the British government vigorously suppressed domestic needs. As a result, although a negligible surplus was obtained in 1956, the total domestic industrial production stagnated again. This year, domestic needs will increase somewhat, and industrial production will probably increase slightly, but the balance of payments surplus will probably decrease again. This situation, where domestic needs are taken care of but foreign needs are neglected, and even sacrificing domestic needs does not result in a sufficient surplus, shows that Britain's balance of payments does not have a stable foundation.
    The special source of funds in the past cannot be relied upon, the need for foreign expenditures has increased, and there is no solid foundation for striving for a balance of payments surplus. The pound is naturally fundamentally unstable.

        The Sterling's Dilemma
    Although British monopoly capital is unwilling to admit the true nature of the problem, they are deeply aware of the difficulty of their situation. During this period, they have repeatedly asked West Germany to raise the mark exchange rate, attempting to increase West German export prices in this way and weaken West German export competitiveness. They even claimed that if West Germany's surplus continued to develop, Britain would, together with other Western European countries, restrict the import of West German goods. However, the West German side, considering West Germany's long-term competition with the United States, and unwilling to face a "dollar shortage" in the future, refused to change the mark-dollar exchange rate, and in turn demanded the devaluation of the pound. They also put forward a suggestion that Western European countries should uniformly expand the restrictions on the upper and lower fluctuations of official exchange rates, and allow exchange rates to fluctuate freely (at present, the fluctuation range of official exchange rates is not allowed to exceed 1% above and below the parity rate according to the regulations of the International Monetary Fund, but in practice the official price range of exchange rates in Western European countries is even smaller). The purpose is to make it impossible for the pound to maintain its current exchange rate in the market. During this period, the British and West German bourgeois newspapers were full of mutual attacks on exchange rate issues and statements from the official authorities of the two countries denying that their respective exchange rates would be changed in any form. At the International Monetary Fund annual meeting from September 23 to 27, British and West German representatives once again declared that their exchange rates would remain unchanged. At present, this stalemate has not been broken.
    Why is British monopoly capital unwilling to let the pound depreciate? Because if the pound depreciates again, Britain may temporarily gain some benefits in expanding exports, but the value of imports will not necessarily decrease as a result, and it is difficult to say how much the balance of payments surplus can increase as a result. However, people who hold pounds in the world will definitely suffer losses, which will make the international market even more reluctant to trust the pound, thereby accelerating the withdrawal of sterling balances, reducing the scope of circulation of the pound, weakening London's position as a financial center, and may even strengthen the centrifugal tendencies of some sterling area countries and shake the sterling bloc. This is something that British monopoly capital would never easily try unless absolutely necessary.
    After the end of the International Monetary Fund annual meeting, since the exchange rates of various countries have not changed, speculation about the appreciation of the mark and the devaluation of the pound in the capitalist world's currency market may temporarily weaken. At the same time, Britain's raising interest rates and West Germany's lowering interest rates can play some role in curbing the flow of funds to West Germany. Therefore, the selling of the pound may temporarily decrease somewhat. But the problem has not been solved, as long as West Germany's export surplus still exists, the threat to the pound also exists.
    In addition to this, British monopoly capital is loudly shouting about "the threat of rising wages" domestically, attempting to intensify the attack on the lives of the working people under the pretext of curbing inflation, and attempting to increase exports and reduce imports by further compressing people's consumption. On September 19, Thorneycroft announced that he was raising the Bank of England rediscount rate to 7%, the highest level in thirty-seven years. And restrict spending in all aspects of the country. It remains to be seen what effect these measures will have in maintaining the exchange rate of the pound, but they are undoubtedly deepening another shadow in the British economy. This is: Due to the growth of domestic fixed capital investment in Britain in the past few years, there is already a huge surplus equipment capacity in the country; the result of further suppressing domestic purchasing power will inevitably expand the contradiction between equipment capacity and product outlets in the domestic market. At the same time, in the current capitalist world market, the momentum of production growth in the past few years has now been greatly weakened, most countries are encountering a lack of foreign exchange and implementing trade policies that reward exports and limit imports, and the possibility of expanding international trade is greatly limited. In this situation, if British monopoly capital intensifies its policy of compressing people's purchasing power, the ultimate consequence will be even more serious.

    困难重重的英镑
    姚念庆
    当前英镑市场的特点
    西欧各国货币比价的失调，最近几个月来有了恶性的发展。其中心问题是西德马克太
  “硬”，英镑和法国法郎太“软”。在欧洲支付同盟每月的清算中，西德的顺差不断扩大，而英法两国的逆差则愈来愈大。长期以来，市场中盛传着马克升值，英镑、法郎贬值的空气。8月10日法国以调整外汇管理办法的名义宣布了法郎的实际贬值以后，英镑承受着极大的压力，市场中大批英镑转换为马克、美元等货币，英镑官价汇率落至官定最低点。8、9月内英镑区的黄金美元贮备一共丧失五亿美元以上，在9月底降至十八亿五千万美元的水平。
    目前英镑疲软、贮备外流的原因，并不是因为英国经常业务性质的对外收支发生了逆差，而是国际市场中对英镑信心不足，将原有的英镑资金转换为外币所造成的。英镑资金的这种抛售由来已久，特别是1955年英国发生战后第四次国际收支危机以来，市场中时时出现英镑贬值的猜测，风吹草动就会引起英镑的抛售。1956年英国国际收支转顺，整个英镑区对外有八千多万美元的顺差，但资金外流的情况没有中止，苏伊士运河问题发生后更是势如脱缰之马，如果不把英国政府动用的借款和出卖石油公司等等特殊收入计算在内，全年丧失的贮备实际达六亿美元以上。今年1月到9月实际丧失的贮备亦在六亿美元以上。国际收支平稳而英镑仍旧经不起风波的这种事实，充分说明了英镑的危机具有深远的根源。
    英镑的脆弱是英国帝国主义经济中的深刻矛盾在外汇市场上的具体反映。
    英镑何以如此脆弱？
    1956年，英国政府公开提出，每年在经常业务性的国际收支方面，争取三亿至三亿五千万镑的顺差，是英国当前经济政策中的首要任务。因为英国垄断资本为了扩大海外投资来加强对日益瓦解的“大英帝国”的控制，提高贮备来巩固英镑市场，同时偿还对外债务，上述的顺差是最低的需要。两年来，英国政府千方百计地压缩国内人民的消费，并且限制了国内投资和削减了政府开支，借以增加出口，缩减进口。但是1956年得到的顺差只有二亿三千三百万镑，而今年估计不过一亿八千万镑而已，如果今后老是不能得到上述要求的顺差，进行海外投资和偿还债务的支出只能靠动用贮备，英镑的未来也只能是更为黯淡而已。
    为什么国际收支顺差的需要在今天对英国垄断资本显得这样紧迫起来了呢？
    战后以来，英国从没有在业务性的国际收支上取得足够的顺差，但是以往每年仍旧有一亿五千万至两亿镑的长期资本投往海外（大部分投入海外英镑区），近年来并且偿还了一些债务，也还维持了一定的、虽然是很低的贮备水平。其原因主要是：战后初年英国曾以奴役性的条件取得了巨额的美“援”；1950年以来，美“援”逐步减少，但殖民地存入伦敦的款项迅速增长，为英国提供了另一个特殊的资金来源。
    作为英镑区金融中心的伦敦，经常保有大量来自海外各地的英镑存款（通称“英镑债款”或“英镑结存”）。战后以来，英国垄断资本极力设法维持和扩大英镑结存的数量。1956年年底这种来自海外各地的英镑结存共三十四亿镑以上，其中近二十九亿镑是属于海外英镑区的。在海外英镑区的结存中，属于英镑区各国的部分（1956年底共十五亿七千四百万镑），近年来存取频繁，而且由1950至1955的六年中减少了三千万镑。
    只有殖民地的结存是不断增长的（1956年底共十二亿八千六百万镑）。由1950至1955的六年中，英国对海外英镑区输出了七亿七千五百万镑的资本；而殖民地的结存增加了六亿五千万镑，提供了80％以上的资金来源。
    但是，时至今日，殖民地独立的历史趋向已经使这一个特殊的资金来源难以继续下去了。加纳、马来亚相继独立，其它殖民地（如尼日利亚）亦在逐步走向独立的道路。此后，它们不但难以将新的资金供应英国，而且还会像今日的印度一样支取原有的存款用于本国的建设。尤其重要的是，马来亚和加纳正是战后殖民地英镑存款的主要来源，在1949到1955的六年中，殖民地所存入伦敦的款项47％来自英属西非（主要是加纳和尼日利亚），40％来自马来亚。1956年年底英国欠殖民地的全部债款中，60％是属于这两个地区的。
    在这种情况下，英国垄断资本既要准备应付英镑结存的支取，又要进一步扩大自己的海外投资，就不得不大声疾呼要“用英国自己的力量”来支付扩大了的对外开支了。
    那末，是什么因素阻碍着这种顺差的取得呢？
    尽管今年英国削减了一些军事开支，但是仍有一年十四亿镑的重担压在英国经济之上。军事生产增加了进口的需要，削弱了出口的能力，同时容易引起国内物资供应的紧张，使物价上升。因此，英国的经济情况几年来总是捉襟见肘，窘相毕露。1953年下半年来，英国国内固定资本投资扩大，生产和就业都有增长，结果是原料进口大增，出口却不能相应地扩大，到1955年就发生了国际收支的危机。英国政府为了挽救危机，争取顺差，大力压制国内需要，结果1956年虽然获得了为数不足道的顺差，国内工业总生产却又停滞下来。今年国内需要会增加一些，工业生产大致也会稍有增长，但国际收支的顺差大约又要减少。这种顾了国内则顾不了国外，甚至牺牲了国内也得不到足够顺差的情形，说明英国的国际收支没有稳定的基础。
    过去特殊的资金来源不可依赖，对外支出的需要增加了，而争取国际收支顺差却没有稳固的基础，英镑自然从根本上就是不稳定的。
        进退两难的英镑
    尽管英国垄断资本不愿承认问题的真正性质，他们也深感自己处境的困难。这一时期来，他们一再要求西德调高马克汇率，企图这样来提高西德出口价格，减弱西德出口竞争力。他们甚至声称，如果西德顺差继续发展，英国将和其它西欧国家一起限制西德货物进口。但是西德方面则顾虑到西德对美国的长期竞争，并且不愿日后自己也来个“美元荒”，拒绝改变马克对美元汇率，反过来要求英镑贬值。他们还提出了一个意见，主张西欧各国一律扩大对官方汇率上下变动的辐度的限制，任令汇率自由波动（现在官方汇率的变动辐度按国际货币基金的规定最多不得超过平价上下各百分之一，实际西欧各国汇率的官价辐度还要小些）。其目的是使英镑在市场上不能维持目前汇率。这一时期以来，英国和西德资产阶级报刊中充满着在汇率问题上的彼此攻讦和两国官方否认本国汇率将作任何形式的改变的声明。在9月23日至27日的国际货币基金年会中，英国和西德代表又再度声明了自己的汇率不变。目前，这个僵局还没有打开。
    英国垄断资本为什么不愿意让英镑贬值呢？因为如果英镑再度贬值，英国在扩大出口方面可能暂时会获得某些好处，但进口值却不一定会因而减少，国际收支顺差能因此而增加多少是很难说的。但是，世界上存有英镑的人肯定地要蒙受损失，这会使国际市场中更加不敢信任英镑，从而加速英镑结存的支取，缩小英镑的流通范围，削弱伦敦作为金融中心的地位，甚至可能加强某些英镑区国家的离心倾向并且动摇英镑集团。这是英国垄断资本除非万不得已决不肯轻易一试的。
    在国际货币基金年会结束以后，由于各国汇率没有变动，资本主义世界货币市场中对于马克升值和英镑贬值的猜测可能暂时减弱，同
  时英国提高利率，西德降低利率，可以对资金流往西德起一些阻遏作用，因而英镑的抛售也许会暂时减少一些。但是问题并没有解决，只要西德出口顺差仍旧存在，对英镑的威胁也是存在的。
    除此而外，英国垄断资本在国内又大喊
  “工资上升的威胁”，企图在制止通货膨胀的借口下加紧向劳动人民生活的进攻，企图用进一步压缩人民消费的方法来增加出口，减少进口。9月19日，桑尼克罗夫特宣布把英格兰银行再贴现率提高至7％的三十七年来最高水平。并且限制国内各方面的开支。这些办法在维持英镑汇率方面能否取得什么效果还未可逆料，但是却无疑地在加深着英国经济中另一阴影。这就是：由于过去几年中英国国内固定资本投资的增长，现在国内已经是存在着巨大的剩余设备能力；进一步压制国内购买力的结果，必然会扩大国内市场上设备能力与产品出路的矛盾。与此同时，目前资本主义世界市场中，过去几年来生产上升的动力现在大大地削弱了，大多数国家都遭遇着外汇的缺乏，执行着奖出限入的贸易政策，国际贸易扩大的可能性受到极大的限制。在这种情形下，如果英国垄断资本变本加厉地执行压缩人民购买力的政策，其最终所将招致的后果将是更为严重的。
