Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, November 21st: Taipei dispatch: A bizarre incident has recently occurred in Taiwan where murder is not considered a crime and the murderer has been pardoned by Chiang Kai-shek.

Huang Xiaoxian, the son of Huang Botao, the former commander of the Kuomintang army corps who was killed by the Chinese People's Liberation Army during the Huaihai Campaign, murdered his friend Yang Shirong with a gun for money and destroyed the body by burning it with gasoline. Under the popular criticism of the Taiwanese people, Chiang Kai-shek's "court" had no choice but to sentence Huang Xiaoxian to death. However, the Kuomintang newspapers in Taiwan then created public opinion, publicizing how Huang Xiaoxian's father, Huang Botao, had "tragically" sacrificed himself during the Huaihai Campaign. Subsequently, more than 400 "National Assembly representatives" and dozens of "Legislative Yuan members" petitioned for pardon, saying that Huang Xiaoxian was from a "prominent family, the descendant of a general," and could murder with impunity. In the end, Chiang Kai-shek came out and issued an "amnesty order." In this way, the murderer Huang Xiaoxian relied on his deceased father's "meritorious service" to Chiang Kai-shek's court, obtaining the privilege of being innocent of murder.

    黄伯韬之子杀人无罪
    新华社广州21日电　台北消息：台湾最近出现一件杀人不算犯罪而凶手受到蒋介石特赦的奇闻。
    淮海战役时，被中国人民解放军击毙的、原蒋军兵团司令黄伯韬的儿子黄效先，因为图人钱财枪杀了朋友杨士荣，并用汽油焚尸灭迹。这件事在台湾人民的纷纷评论下，蒋介石集团的“法院”不得不判处黄效先死刑。但是，接着台湾的国民党报纸就制造舆论，宣传凶手之父黄伯韬如何在淮海战役时“惨烈”牺牲，接着四百多名“国大代表”和几十名“立法委员”又上书请赦，说黄效先是“世家子弟，将门后裔”，可以杀人无罪。最后，由蒋介石出来颁布了“特赦令”。这样，凶手黄效先就依靠死去的父亲尽忠于蒋氏朝廷的“功绩”，获得了杀人无罪的特权。
