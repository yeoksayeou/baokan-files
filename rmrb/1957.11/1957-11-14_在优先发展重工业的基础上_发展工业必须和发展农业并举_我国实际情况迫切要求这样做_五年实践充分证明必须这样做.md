Xinhua News Agency, 13th Dispatch: Xinhua News Agency reporter Luo Feng reports: The policy put forward by Chairman Mao Zedong that, on the basis of giving priority to the development of heavy industry, the development of industry must be combined with the simultaneous development of agriculture, has attracted the attention of the people of the whole country. The reporter recently interviewed the heads of relevant central departments on some issues of this policy.

The head of the relevant department first pointed out that in order to realize China's socialist industrialization, it is undoubtedly certain that priority should be given to the development of heavy industry. The current policy of developing industry in conjunction with agriculture is precisely to ensure that the construction policy centered on heavy industry is better implemented; to make industry and agriculture better connected and more coordinated in development, so as to ensure the continuous expansion of national construction and the gradual improvement of people's lives. Therefore, the implementation of this policy is of great significance for accelerating the process of socialist industrialization in China.

Five years of practice have proved that the speed of agricultural development is directly proportional to the speed of industrial development and the speed of the development of the entire national economy.

The head then talked about the importance of developing agriculture based on the implementation of the first five-year plan. He pointed out that five years of practice have proved that the importance of agriculture in the national economy has become clearer. If agriculture develops rapidly, industry develops rapidly, and the entire national economy develops rapidly. Conversely, if agriculture develops slowly, industry develops slowly, and the entire national economy develops slowly. For example, in 1952 and 1955, agriculture had bumper harvests, and the national economy developed relatively quickly in 1953 and 1956, with the total industrial output value (including handicrafts, the same below) increasing by 30.2% and 28.2% respectively; the poor agricultural harvests of 1954 and 1956 resulted in a relatively slow development of the national economy in 1955 and 1957, with the total industrial output value increasing by only 5.6% and about 4% respectively (planned, the actual will exceed). The reason is that about 80% of the raw materials needed by China's light industry rely on agriculture, and light industry still accounts for about 50% of the entire industry. About 80% of the commodities needed by the Chinese people for their domestic life are also agricultural products and processed agricultural products; agricultural products and processed agricultural products account for about 75% of the materials needed for China's export trade. The increase or decrease in the volume of transportation by railways, highways, and waterways is also affected by the abundance or scarcity of agriculture. All of this greatly affects the accumulation of national construction funds. Due to the bumper harvest in 1952, China's fiscal revenue in 1953 increased by 24% compared with 1952. Due to the poor harvest in 1954, it only increased by 3.7% in 1955 compared with 1954; due to the bumper harvest in 1955, it increased by 15.8% in 1956 compared with 1955, and due to the poor harvest in 1956, it only planned to increase by 1.9% in 1957 compared with 1956. It can be seen that agriculture in China largely determines the speed of development of the national economy.

The head said that China has a large population, and it is increasing rapidly; although people's lives have greatly improved compared with before liberation, the living standards are still not high; all this urgently requires the development of agriculture. Calculated on the basis of an annual increase of 13 million in China's population, plus an increase of 2% in the national per capita consumption level of grain and cotton cloth, approximately 13 billion catties of grain and 600,000 dan of cotton are needed. It can be seen that if agriculture cannot be further developed, due to the increase in population, people's lives will not only fail to improve, but there is also a danger of decline.

China's vast rural areas are not only the main market for light industry, but also an important market for heavy industry, and the development of agriculture can promote the development of heavy industry.

The head said that we should also see that China's vast rural areas are not only the main market for light industry, but also an important market for heavy industry. The development of agriculture will not only not affect the priority development of heavy industry, but will also promote the development of heavy industry. China's large-scale agricultural technology reform has not yet been carried out, but even under this situation, the amount of heavy industrial products needed in rural areas is very large. For example, among the heavy industrial products supplied to the market, the proportion supplied to rural areas is more than 12% for pig iron, more than 50% for coal, more than 80% for kerosene, about 30% for timber, and almost all chemical fertilizers and pesticides are supplied to rural areas, in addition to a large number of agricultural, water conservancy and other machinery. In fact, many heavy industrial products are far from meeting the needs of rural areas. With the gradual development of China's agricultural technology reform, the demand for heavy industrial products in rural areas will be more and more. It is estimated that in the case of chemical fertilizers alone, at least 30 million tons will be needed to initially meet the needs of agriculture. At present, China can only supply more than 1.6 million tons of chemical fertilizers to rural areas. It can be seen that this huge need in China's rural areas has opened up a very broad road for the development of China's heavy industry. No country in the world has such a large domestic market as China.

In the past five years, the state has made great efforts to develop agriculture, and agriculture has also made great progress, but it still cannot meet the needs of people's lives and national construction.

The head also used the practice of the first five-year plan to illustrate the arduousness of developing China's agriculture. He said that in the past five years, under the strong leadership of the Party and the government, the historical task of agricultural cooperativization has been basically completed in rural areas across the country; the state's appropriations for agriculture, forestry, and water conservancy totaled more than 7.5 billion yuan, and increased loans were nearly 2.9 billion yuan; the state supplied rural areas with more than 6.6 million tons of chemical fertilizers and a large number of agricultural tools, water conservancy machinery, and some tractors. In the past five years, China has expanded its cultivated land area by approximately 70 million mu, and its sown area by more than 280 million mu, with an irrigation area of more than 230 million mu. In addition, farmers themselves invested approximately more than 10 billion yuan in production. The broad masses of farmers have also actively carried out intensive cultivation, promoted improved varieties, and prevented and controlled pests and diseases. After such great efforts, according to the planned figures for 1957, the total output value of agricultural and sideline industries across the country increased by about 26% in the past five years, with grain increasing by 23%, or more than 70 billion catties, and cotton increasing by 15%, or 3.9 million dan. It should be said that such a growth rate of agricultural production in China is very high. However, if compared with the needs of people's lives and the needs of national construction, and compared with the development of industry, agriculture still appears to be lagging behind.

China has a fast population growth, little arable land, and low yield per unit area. Only by giving full play to its potential can the speed of agricultural development catch up with the speed of population growth.

The head analyzed the many objective conditions for developing China's agriculture. He said that the existing cultivated land area in the country is more than 1.68 billion mu. Averaged by the national population, each person has only 2.6 mu; averaged by the agricultural population, each person has only more than 3 mu, which is very small. The yield per mu in China, calculated on the average of 1955 and 1956, is no more than 190 catties of grain and no more than 30 catties of cotton. Such a quantity is lower than that of the United States, Japan and other countries. The unit output in many areas is relatively high, especially the unit output of rice, and the average of many cooperatives has reached more than 1,000 catties. However, because China suffers from natural disasters of varying degrees every year, the national average unit yield appears to be relatively low; even in areas with higher unit yields, it is very unstable, sometimes high and sometimes low. Taking the first four years of the Five-Year Plan as a whole, the disaster-stricken area in the country was approximately 770 million mu, with an average annual disaster-stricken area of 190 million mu, of which the most serious was in 1956, when the disaster-stricken area reached 240 million mu. The total grain loss due to disasters in the four years was approximately 75 billion catties, which is more than the actual increase in grain production in the five years; the cotton loss due to disasters was nearly 7.9 million dan, which also greatly exceeded the actual increase in cotton production in the five years. China's small cultivated land area, low yield, and serious natural disasters are unfavorable conditions for agricultural production. It is precisely for these reasons that in the next few years, China will need more efforts to develop agriculture. Of course, the above situation also shows that China's agriculture has extremely huge potential power. As long as we improve water conservancy, prevent and control droughts and floods, increase irrigation area, increase fertilizer application, and promote effective advanced technologies and advanced experiences, the unit yield can be greatly improved. At the same time, although China has relatively little reclaimable land, and most of it is located in remote areas, and reclamation is not easy, it is entirely possible to reclaim more than 10 million mu of wasteland across the country every year in the next few decades. Therefore, it is also groundless to lack confidence in the development of agriculture in China. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, we will definitely be able to achieve a speed of agricultural development that is higher than the speed of population growth.

In order to effectively overcome the imbalance between the production of means of subsistence and the needs for improvement of people's lives, we must also pay attention to the development of agriculture and light industry.

The head also explained the necessity of the policy of developing industry and agriculture simultaneously from the perspective of the balance between industry and agriculture. He said that this balance is reflected in the balance between the production of means of production and national construction, and the balance between the production of means of subsistence and the needs for improvement of people's lives. In recent years, due to the expansion of the scale of national construction and the improvement of people's living standards, the supply of means of production and means of subsistence in the market has been relatively tight. However, the specific situations of these two types of materials are different. In terms of means of production, production is relatively stable and the growth rate is relatively fast. Its consumption is relatively easy to control. As long as the development speed of capital construction is appropriately arranged, the tension of certain materials can be eased. The facts in 1957 have proved this point. At the same time, the shortage of certain means of production can also be overcome by importing. However, the situation of means of subsistence is the opposite. On the one hand, production is unstable and the growth rate is slow; on the other hand, due to the increase in population and the great need for people to improve their lives, the consumption increases rapidly and is not easy to control. At the same time, it is impossible to import a large amount of means of subsistence when they are insufficient. This situation also makes us pay more attention to the development of agriculture and light industry.

Due to the improvement of industrial level and the increase in industrial support for agriculture, there are now more favorable conditions for implementing the policy of developing industry and agriculture simultaneously.

After talking about the above-mentioned aspects, the head then said that the proposal of the policy of developing industry and agriculture in conjunction with the priority development of heavy industry is not only of great significance for the development of China's national economy, but also has more favorable conditions for implementing this policy at present. He emphasized that after the first five-year plan, the preliminary foundation of China's socialist industrialization has been established, the industrial level has been greatly improved compared with before liberation, and the industrial sector has more possibilities to support agriculture. For example, in the chemical industry, China is currently able to manufacture complete sets of equipment by itself, and the output of chemical fertilizers will reach about 700,000 tons in 1957, an increase of about 260% compared with 1952. It is estimated that the output of chemical fertilizers may reach 5 million to 7 million tons by 1962, an increase of seven to ten times compared with 1957. This is a great support for agriculture. Due to the development of the chemical industry, China's man-made fiber and synthetic fiber industries will also develop relatively quickly. This will also gradually reduce the burden on agriculture and promote the development of agriculture, which is mainly grain. During the second five-year plan, China's machinery industry will be able to supply a large number of water conservancy machinery and various agricultural machinery suitable for China's conditions, as well as more rural transportation tools. The fuel industry and the transportation department will also provide more support to agriculture. In the agricultural sector, the basic completion of cooperativization has opened up extremely broad roads for the development of China's agricultural productivity. In the future, agricultural production cooperatives will show greater superiority. In the future, the state will further expand its investment in agriculture, and the internal accumulation of agricultural production cooperatives will also be further increased. In this way, the material basis for the expansion of agricultural reproduction will be more solid. During the first five-year plan, there were about 100 projects above the limited amount for capital construction in agriculture, forestry, and water conservancy, and these constructions will further play a role in agriculture. In particular, in recent years, party and government departments in various places have accumulated a lot of useful experience in leading agricultural production. In recent years, it is no longer an isolated case that grain production per mu has reached 1,000 catties and cotton production per mu has reached 100 catties. Further promotion of these experiences will have a great effect on the development of agriculture. After the socialist debate in rural areas across the country, the political awareness and production enthusiasm of farmers have been further improved, and a new upsurge in production has begun to appear in rural areas. Therefore, the head said that it is entirely possible to strive to achieve the requirements put forward in the "Revised Draft of the National Agricultural Development Program from 1956 to 1967" in the next ten years or so.

Implementing the policy of developing industry and agriculture simultaneously must not neglect the priority development of heavy industry; but in order to promote the development of agriculture, heavy industry should appropriately adjust its internal relations.

The head talked about the issues that deserve attention when implementing this policy. He said that it must not be thought that implementing the policy of developing industry and agriculture simultaneously can neglect the fact that economic construction is centered on heavy industry, and neglect the priority development of heavy industry. Large-scale industry centered on heavy industry is the foundation of socialism; without the priority development of heavy industry, it is impossible to realize the modernization of industry and the modernization of agriculture in a relatively short period of time. He also said that in order to promote the development of agriculture, heavy industry should appropriately adjust its internal relations in development. Heavy industries that are directly related to agriculture and light industry should develop faster, among which the chemical industry must have greater development. In addition to the chemical fertilizer industry, attention should also be paid to establishing a foundation for the synthetic fiber industry. The metallurgical, coal, petroleum and power industries, which are currently in short supply and are needed to develop agricultural production and improve the lives of farmers, should also have faster development. The machinery industry should make overall arrangements in production, and the machinery industry under the central government should be combined with the machinery industry under the local government, and strive to increase the production of various agricultural, water conservancy and transportation machinery that are strong, light and suitable for agricultural needs, and increase the production of small rural power generation equipment. Light industry should be actively developed, and the size of the scale should be balanced with the situation of raw materials. The focus of textile industry construction should be on synthetic fibers and man-made fibers; we should also try our best to pay attention to the use of wool, flax, silk and other fiber resources.

The development of agriculture should adhere to the policy of focusing on increasing the yield per unit area and supplementing it with wasteland reclamation. To this end, we must pay attention to increasing fertilizer and building water conservancy projects.

The head said that in the agricultural sector, efforts should be made to strive to achieve the various requirements put forward in the "Revised Draft of the National Agricultural Development Program". In the coming period, we should pay attention to focusing on increasing the yield per unit area and supplementing it with wasteland reclamation. In order to achieve a higher unit yield, in addition to vigorously consolidating agricultural production cooperatives, the main thing is to pay attention to increasing fertilizer and building water conservancy projects. We should strive to develop chemical fertilizers, but because China's chemical industry foundation is weak, it is not possible to increase the production of chemical fertilizers much in the coming period. Therefore, we must pay full attention to the use of natural fertilizers. For the development of farmland water conservancy, we should adapt measures to local conditions, focus on small-scale, supplemented by medium-sized, and build large-scale water conservancy projects in a planned manner under possible conditions. In order to develop agriculture, we should also increase the necessary agricultural machinery and power equipment as much as possible, and pay attention to promoting advanced experiences and advanced technologies in accordance with local conditions. We should pay attention to protecting stable and high-yield areas, rectifying disaster-prone and low-yield areas, and developing mountainous areas. The Hebei, Shandong, Henan, and northern Jiangsu and northern Anhui regions of China are densely populated economic crop areas, but because they are often subject to floods and waterlogging disasters in the Huaihe River and Haihe River basins, the output is very unstable. For these areas, we must continue to thoroughly manage the Huaihe River and start to thoroughly manage the Haihe River, especially paying attention to waterlogging control. The mountainous areas of China should be quickly planned and vigorously developed. The state should actively support them, implement diversified operations, plant trees and forests in a planned manner, and strive to maintain soil and water.

    在优先发展重工业的基础上
    发展工业必须和发展农业并举
    我国实际情况迫切要求这样做　五年实践充分证明必须这样做
    新华社13日讯　新华社记者骆风报道：毛泽东主席提出的在优先发展重工业的基础上，发展工业必须和发展农业同时并举的方针，引起了全国人民的注意。记者最近并就这个方针的一些问题访问了中央有关部门的负责人。
    有关部门的负责人首先指出，为了实现我国的社会主义工业化，优先发展重工业是肯定无疑的。现在提出发展工业必须和发展农业同时并举的方针，正是为了保证以重工业为中心的建设方针得到更好的贯彻；使工农业在发展中彼此衔接得更好和更加协调，既保证国家建设的不断扩大，也保证人民生活的逐步改善。因此，这个方针的贯彻执行，对于加速我国社会主义工业化的进程有着重大的意义。
    五年来的实践证明：农业发展的快慢和工业发展的快慢以及整个国民经济发展的快慢成正比例
    负责人接着从第一个五年计划的执行情况谈到发展农业的重要性。他指出，五年来的实践证明，农业在国民经济中的重要性更加清楚了。农业发展快，工业的发展就快，整个国民经济的发展也就快。相反，农业发展慢，工业的发展就慢，整个国民经济的发展也就慢。如1952年和1955年农业丰收，1953年和1956年的国民经济就发展得比较快，如工业总产值（包括手工业，下同）分别增长了30．2％和28．2％； 1954年和1956年的农业歉收，1955年和1957年的国民经济就发展得比较慢，如工业总产值分别只增长5．6％和4％左右（计划，实际会超过）。原因在于我国轻工业所需要的原料，约有80％左右依靠农业，而我国轻工业在整个工业中的比重还占50％左右。我国供应国内人民生活需要的商品，也有80％左右是农产品和农产品加工品；我国出口贸易所需要的物资，农产品和农产品加工品占75％左右。我国铁路、公路、水路的运输量的增减，也受到农业丰歉的影响。而这一切，都大大地影响着国家建设资金的积累。我国财政收入，由于1952年丰收，1953年比1952年就增长了24％，由于1954年歉收，1955年比1954年就只增长了3．7％；1955年丰收，1956年就比1955年增长了15．8％，1956年歉收，1957年就只比1956年计划增长1．9％。可见，我国农业在很大程度上决定国民经济的发展速度。
    负责人说，我国人口众多，并且增加很快；人民生活虽然比解放以前有了很大的改善，但是生活水平仍然不高；这都迫切要求农业的发展。我国的人口以每年增加一千三百万计算，加上全国每人每年的粮食和棉布的消费水平提高2％，就需要大约一百三十亿斤粮食和六十万担棉花。可见，如果农业得不到进一步的发展，由于人口的增加，人民生活不但不能提高，而且还有降低的危险。
    我国广大农村不仅是轻工业的主要市场，也是重工业的重要市场，农业的发展可以促进重工业的发展
    负责人说，我们还应该看到，我国广大农村不仅是轻工业的主要市场，而且是重工业的重要市场。农业的发展，不仅不影响重工业的优先发展，而且会促进重工业的发展。我国目前大规模的农业技术改革还没有进行，但是即使在这种情况下，农村需要重工业品的数量也很大。比如市场供应的重工业品中，供应农村的比重，生铁占12％以上，煤占50％以上，煤油占80％以上，木材占30％左右，化学肥料和农药，几乎全部供应农村，此外还有大量的农业、水利等机械。实际上，许多重工业品都远远不能满足农村的需要。随着我国农业技术改革的逐步展开，农村对于重工业品的需要将是越来越多。据估计，仅化学肥料一项，如果要初步满足农业的需要，至少要有三千多万吨。而我国目前能够供应农村的化学肥料仅为一百六十多万吨。可以看出，我国农村的这种庞大的需要，正是为我国重工业的发展开辟了非常广阔的道路，世界上没有一个国家有像我国这样广大的国内市场。
    五年来国家为发展农业作了很大努力，农业也有了很大发展，但仍然不能满足人民生活和国家建设的需要
    负责人还从第一个五年计划的实践，说明发展我国农业的艰巨性。他说，五年来，在党和政府的大力领导下，全国农村基本上完成了农业合作化的历史任务；国家对于农林、水利事业的拨款共有七十五亿多元，增加的贷款将近二十九亿元；国家供应了农村六百几十万吨的化学肥料和大量的农具、水利机械和一部分拖拉机。五年内，我国扩大了耕地面积约七千万亩，播种面积二亿八千多万亩，灌溉面积有二亿三千多万亩。此外，农民自己用于生产的投资约有一百多亿元。广大农民还积极进行了精耕细作，推广良种和防治病虫害等等。经过这样大的努力，按照1957年的计划数字计算，五年内全国农副业总产量增长了26％左右，其中粮食增长了23％，即七百多亿斤，棉花增长了15％，即三百九十万担。应该说，我国农业生产这样的增长速度是很高的。但是，如果同人民生活的需要以及国家建设的需要比起来，同工业的发展比起来，农业还是显得落后了一步。
    我国人口增长快，可耕土地少，单位面积产量低，只有充分发挥潜力，才能使农业发展的速度赶上人口增长的速度
    负责人分析了发展我国农业的许多客观条件。他说，全国现有的耕地面积是十六亿八千多万亩，按全国人口平均，每人只有二点六亩；按农业人口平均，每人也只有三亩多，数量是很少的。我国每亩地的产量，以1955年和1956年平均计算，粮食不过一百九十多斤，棉花不过三十多斤，这样的数量比美国、日本等国都低。有许多地区的单位产量比较高，特别是水稻的单位产量，许多合作社平均达到一千斤以上。但是由于我国年年有或大或小的自然灾害，全国平均的单位产量就显得比较低；即使单位产量较高的地区，也很不稳定，时高时低。以五年计划的前四年合计，全国受灾面积约有七亿七千万亩，平均每年受灾一亿九千万亩，其中最严重的是1956年，受灾面积达到二亿四千万亩。四年合计因灾损失的粮食约为七百五十亿斤，这个数目比五年粮食实际增长的产量还多；因灾损失的棉花将近七百九十万担，也大大超过了五年棉花实际增长的产量。我国的耕地面积少，产量低，自然灾害严重，是农业生产的不利条件。正是这些原因，在今后的若干年内，我国就需要有更多的力量来发展农业。当然，上述情况也说明我国农业有极巨大的潜在力量，只要改善水利，防治水旱灾害，增加灌溉面积，增施肥料，以及推广有效的先进技术和先进经验，单位产量就可以大大提高。同时，我国可垦荒地虽然比较少，而且大多处在边远地区，开垦不易，但是在今后几十年的时间内，每年全国开垦一千几百万亩的荒地，是完全可能的。因此，对于发展我国农业缺乏信心，也是毫无根据的。在共产党领导下，我们一定能够做到使农业发展的速度高于人口增长的速度。
    为了有效地克服生活资料的生产和人民生活改善需要之间的不平衡状况，也必须注意农业和轻工业的发展
    负责人还从工农业之间的平衡关系问题上，说明了发展工业和发展农业同时并举的方针的必要性。他说这种平衡关系，表现在生产资料的生产和国家建设之间的平衡，生活资料的生产和人民生活改善需要之间的平衡。近年来，由于国家建设规模的扩大和人民生活水平的提高，市场上生产资料和生活资料的供应情况都比较紧张。但是这两种物资的具体情况有所不同。从生产资料说，生产比较稳定，增长速度比较快，它的消费比较容易控制，只要适当安排基本建设的发展速度，某些物资的紧张情况就可以缓和。1957年的事实已经证明了这一点。同时，某些生产资料不足，还可以采取进口的办法来克服一时的困难。而生活资料的情况却相反，一方面是生产不稳定，增长速度慢；另一方面由于人口增加和人民改善生活的需要大，消费量增长快，并且不容易控制。同时，生活资料不足，也不可能大量进口。这种情况也使得我们要更加注意对农业和轻工业的发展。
    由于工业水平的提高，工业支援农业力量的增加，现在执行发展工农业并举的方针就有了更有利的条件
    这位负责人在谈了上述各方面的问题以后，接着说，在优先发展重工业的基础上，发展工业和发展农业同时并举的方针的提出，不但对发展我国国民经济有巨大的意义，而且在目前贯彻执行这个方针也有着更多的有利条件。他着重指出，经过第一个五年计划，我国的社会主义工业化的初步基础已经建立起来了，工业水平比解放以前有了很大的提高，工业方面已有更多的可能支援农业。比如化学工业，我国目前已经能够自己制造成套的设备，化学肥料的产量1957年将达到七十万吨左右，比1952年增长260％左右。估计到1962年化学肥料的产量可能达到五百万吨到七百万吨，比1957年增长七倍到十倍。这对农业是极大的支援。由于化学工业的发展，我国的人造纤维和合成纤维工业也将比较快的发展起来。这也将逐渐减轻农业的负担，能促进以粮食为主的农业的发展。我国的机械工业，在第二个五年计划期间，将能大量供应适合于我国情况的水利机械和各种农业机械，以及更多的农村运输工具。燃料工业和交通部门也将对农业有更多的支援。在农业方面，由于合作化的基本完成，给我国农业生产力的发展开辟了极为广阔的道路。今后农业生产合作社将要显示出更大的优越性。国家今后还将进一步扩大对农业的投资，农业生产合作社的内部积累也将进一步增加。这样，农业扩大再生产的物质基础就将更加雄厚。在第一个五年计划内，农林水利基本建设限额以上的项目有一百个左右，这些建设将进一步对农业发挥作用。特别是近几年来，各地党政部门对农业生产的领导积累了很多有益的经验，全国各地近年来出现亩产千斤粮、百斤皮棉已经不是个别的事例。这些经验的进一步推广，对发展农业有很大的作用。在全国农村经过社会主义大辩论以后，农民的政治觉悟和生产热情更加提高，农村中已开始出现新的生产高潮。因此，负责人说，在今后十多年内，争取达到“1956年到1967年全国农业发展纲要修正草案”中所提出的要求是完全可能的。
    执行发展工农业同时并举的方针，决不能忽视重工业的优先发展；但为了促进农业的发展，重工业应该适当调整内部关系
    负责人谈到了在贯彻执行这个方针时值得注意的问题。他说，决不能认为，执行发展工业和发展农业同时并举的方针，就可以忽视经济建设以重工业为中心，忽视重工业的优先发展。以重工业为中心的大工业是社会主义的基础；没有重工业的优先发展，就不能在较短的时间内实现工业的现代化和农业的现代化。他又说，为了促进农业的发展，重工业在发展中应该适当调整内部关系。同农业、轻工业有直接关系的重工业应当发展得快一些，其中化学工业必须有更大的发展，除化学肥料工业外还要注意为合成纤维工业建立基础。目前供应较紧的并为发展农业生产和改善农民群众生活所需要的冶金、煤炭、石油和电力工业也都应当有较快的发展。机械工业，应该在生产上统筹安排，中央所属的机械工业要和地方所属的机械工业结合，努力增产农业所需要的坚固、轻便和适用的各种农业、水利和运输等机械，增产小型的农村用的发电设备。轻工业应该积极发展，规模的大小要和原料的情况相平衡。纺织工业建设的重点，应该放在合成纤维和人造纤维方面；还应该尽量注意利用毛、麻、丝及其他纤维资源。
    发展农业应该坚持提高单位面积产量为主开荒为辅的方针，为此，必须注意增加肥料和兴修水利
    负责人说，在农业方面，应该为争取达到“全国农业发展纲要修正草案”中所提出的各项要求而努力。在今后相当时期内，应该注意以提高单位产量为主，开荒为辅。为了达到更高的单位产量，除了大力巩固农业生产合作社以外，主要是注意增加肥料和兴修水利。我们应该努力发展化学肥料，但是由于我国化学工业基础薄弱，在今后一定时期内化学肥料的增产还不可能很多，因此，必须充分注意利用自然肥料。对于农田水利的发展，应该因地制宜，以小型为主，中型为辅，在可能的条件下有计划地兴修大型水利工程。为了发展农业，还应该尽可能地增加农业必需的机械和动力设备，并且注意因地制宜地推广先进经验和先进技术。应该分别情况，注意保护稳产区和高产区，整治易灾区和低产区，开发山区。我国的河北、山东、河南和苏北、皖北地区是人口稠密的经济作物区，但是因为常受淮河和海河流域的洪水和内涝灾害，产量很不稳定。对于这些地区，必须继续根治淮河，开始根治海河，特别是注意治涝工作。我国的山区应该迅速规划和大力开发，国家要积极扶助，要实行多种经营，要有计划地植树造林，努力保持水土。
