Today's Greece
By Greek journalist Saloglou

    Developments After the War
    The situation in Greece after the war once held hope for change. During the war and the German occupation, the Greek people fought for the liberation of their homeland and for the establishment of a democratic system after liberation. As the war drew to a close, various proposals emerged across the country to promote the realization of a democratic system. However, due to the intervention of British and American imperialism on the one hand, and the serious mistakes made by the leaders of the progressive movement on the other, the people's expectations were ultimately dashed.

    In early 1945, the left-wing forces suffered a military defeat, and the first civil war, known as the December Revolution, came to an end. From then on, the country was led onto a path of fascistization. During this period, the government was constantly tottering and extremely unstable, with one British puppet government after another collapsing, five governments falling in a single year. Reactionary forces prepared to launch a general attack on the progressive movement. George II restored his throne through a so-called "civil plebiscite" stained with the blood of the people. This was Britain's last act in Greece. The following year, the United States, under the guise of "Truman Doctrine" military and economic aid, replaced Britain in occupying Greece.

    In 1947, the Communist Party of Greece was declared illegal, and the second civil war broke out. In 1949, due to imperialist armed intervention, the revolutionary army was defeated again. Two thousand five hundred communists were executed by military tribunals, and about one hundred thousand people were thrown into prisons and exile concentration camps. Trade union organizations were dissolved, and large numbers of progressive civil servants were excluded from government agencies.

    Nevertheless, the people's will to demand democracy remained unwavering. In 1950, the first election after the end of the civil war was held. Prominent figures from the left-wing socialist party formed an electoral alliance and won 70,000 votes out of approximately 300,000 voters in Athens. General Plastiras' party put forward the slogan of restoring peace and democracy throughout the country and participated in the election, winning a relative majority. The People's Party, which had ruled the country during the civil war, suffered a disastrous defeat. However, at that time, the Communist Party of Greece, under the leadership of Zachariadis (who has now been expelled from the party), did not make full use of all possibilities to strengthen its ties with the masses, but instead became even more detached from them. In the 1952 election, the left-wing forces did not actively support General Plastiras to prevent the extreme right from coming to power, which resulted in General Papagos' "Greek Rally" winning an overwhelming majority in the election, gaining 247 seats out of 300. Since coming to power, this party has spared no effort to carry out the orders of the United States and Greek big capitalists, pursue a reactionary foreign policy, and attack the left-wing forces.

    Foreign Policy
    The reactionary Greek government had already signed an agreement with Washington in 1953, allowing the United States to establish military bases on Greek territory. A few months ago, the right-wing reactionary party led by Karamanlis after the death of General Papagos, and renamed the "National Radical Union," also announced its acceptance of the American "Eisenhower Doctrine." With these two agreements, Greece is under American control and has fallen into a whirlpool of extremely dangerous trends. Because, if the United States provokes a war in the Near East, Greece is bound to be drawn into the war, or at least its territory will be used as a base for the United States to attack the people of Arab countries. This would of course bring unimaginable serious consequences.

    It must be pointed out that Greece is the only country in the "free world" that endures the constraints of "extraterritoriality." American military personnel and other personnel stationed in Greece are not subject to Greek court trials even if they commit serious crimes.

    As for Greece's relations with the countries of the socialist camp, the situation today is better than it was three years ago. Currently, Greece has established diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania. This is also due to the general trend of the international situation and the will of the Greek people. It is certain that it will not be too long before Greece establishes diplomatic relations with New China. Because this is the urgent demand of the Greek people, and more and more Greek politicians have come to understand that it is detrimental not to deal with the People's China and to deal with the "non-existent" Chiang Kai-shek regime.

    The Cyprus Issue
    A relatively complete picture of Greece's current foreign policy cannot be obtained without discussing the important issue of Cyprus. This issue involves contradictions between Britain and the United States. It was the United States that instigated Papagos to bring the issue to the United Nations in 1954. The United States' intention at the time was to put pressure on Britain and squeeze Britain out of Cyprus as much as possible. However, after this issue was brought to the table, an armed struggle broke out on the island of Cyprus against the conquerors, and the development of the situation far exceeded the United States' original intentions. The Greek people fully support the struggle of the Cypriot people for liberation and have turned their hatred towards the United States, because the United States is pursuing a policy hostile to the legitimate national aspirations of the Greek people.

    The Cypriot people still need to wage a long and arduous struggle to achieve independence and autonomy. The Greek government has proven that its policy is to help the success of American policy, rather than to ensure the right to self-determination for the people of Cyprus. The Greek government sometimes shows that it is not so obedient to the will of the United States, which is purely due to popular pressure.

    Economic Situation
    Greece is still an economically backward country. The national income is mainly agricultural. There are only some light industries, and the equipment is outdated. Only 40% of the production capacity is being used. There are two decisive factors hindering the country's industrialization: first, the heavy burden of military expenditure. Since the end of the civil war, annual military expenditure has accounted for 50% to 60% of the national budget. The consequence of this situation is that the construction expenditure invested in production each year is less than 10% of the entire budget, or 2% to 3% of the national income. This amount of money is not even enough to maintain the country's highways. Secondly, the United States strictly controls the Greek economy and does not allow Greece to carry out heavy industrial construction. There is a well-known example: Germany delivered a blast furnace to Greece in the name of compensation, but the United States prevented Greece from accepting the blast furnace. In addition, the United States also prevents Greece from developing trade and expanding economic relations with the People's Democratic countries and the Soviet Union, although the Soviet Union has repeatedly announced that it is extremely willing to exchange industrial equipment with Greece for agricultural products and raw materials.

    Due to this economic policy, almost all of Greece's industrial products have to rely on foreign imports, and in terms of foreign payments, it can only rely on unreliable tourism income and American aid. Especially after the implementation of the free import policy, a large number of foreign commodities poured into Greece, further destroying Greek industry.

    People's Livelihood
    This poor economic situation in Greece has made the lives of the vast majority of the people increasingly impoverished. The drachma (the name of the Greek currency) continues to depreciate, reducing the income of the working people. Today, the real wages of workers are only 70% to 75% of what they were in 1938. According to official statistics, 75% of the social income of industry flows into the pockets of capitalists, and only 25% goes to the workers. According to the estimate of the General Confederation of Labor (now in the hands of reformists who are servants of the capitalists), a worker must have twice his current income to maintain the minimum living standards of his family. Therefore, eleven- and twelve-year-old children are forced to work to make up for the family's expenses. Tuberculosis is very common among the working masses.

    The situation of farmers is even worse than that of workers, and their income is generally only half that of workers.

    Of the eight million people in Greece, according to official statistics, about three million are poor and destitute.

               ×××
    The above is a very brief description of the situation in Greece today. The Greek people are now fighting to change this situation. This struggle is arduous. The assistance given to the Greek people by all the peoples of countries that have already achieved national independence and genuine democracy is extremely precious and indispensable to the Greek people.

    今天的希腊
    希腊记者　萨洛格鲁
    战后局势的发展
    战后希腊的局势曾经有过改变的希望。在大战时期和德国占领时期，希腊人民为祖国的解放进行了斗争，也为解放后实现民主制度进行了斗争。当战争接近结束的时候，全国出现各种促进民主制度实现的建议。可是，一方面由于英美帝国主义的干涉，另一方面由于进步运动的领导人犯了严重的错误，到后来人民的期望落空了。
    1945年年初，左派力量在军事上遭受挫败，以十二月革命著名的第一次内战即告结束。从此以后，全国就被引到法西斯化的轨道上。在这一时期，政府老是摇摇欲坠，极不稳定，英国傀儡的希腊政府一个接着一个倒下来，一年内倒了五个政府。反动势力准备对进步运动发动一个总攻击。乔治二世靠了染满人民鲜血的所谓“公民复决”恢复了王位。这是英国在希腊的最后一个活动。第二年，美国在“杜鲁门主义”军事经济援助名义下代替英国占领希腊。
    1947年，希腊共产党被宣布为非法，于是爆发了第二次内战。1949年，由于帝国主义的武装干涉，革命军队再次遭到失败。二千五百名共产党员被军事法庭处决，大约十万人被投入牢狱和流放集中营，工会组织被解散，成批的进步公务员被排除出政府机关。
    尽管如此，人民的要求民主的意志依然坚定不移。1950年举行内战结束后的第一次选举，左翼社会党的著名人士缔成选举联盟，在雅典大约三十万选民中获得七万选票。普拉斯蒂拉斯将军的政党提出全国恢复和平和民主的口号，参加竞选，获得了相对多数。在内战时期统治国家的人民党遭到惨败。然而，当时希腊共产党在萨查利迪斯领导下（萨查利迪斯现已被开除出党），不去尽量利用一切可能性来加强与群众的联系，反而更加脱离了群众。1952年选举中，左派力量没有积极支持普拉斯蒂拉斯将军以阻止极端右派上台，结果使贝贝格斯将军的“希腊人民联盟”在选举中取得了绝大多数，在三百个议席中获得二百四十七席。这个政党执政以来，不遗余力地执行美国和希腊大资本家的命令，奉行反动的对外政策，打击左派力量。
    对外政策
    希腊反动政府在1953年已经和华盛顿签订协定，允许美国在希腊领土上建立军事基地。几个月以前，在贝贝格斯将军死后由卡拉曼利斯领导并且改名为“国民激进联盟”的那个右派反动政党，又宣布接受美国的“艾森豪威尔主义”。有了这两个协定，希腊已处于美国控制之下，而且陷入了趋势十分险恶的漩涡中。因为，如果美国在近东挑起战争，希腊势必要被卷入战争，至少它的领土将被作为美国进攻阿拉伯各国人民的基地。这样当然会带来不可设想的严重后果。
    必须指出，希腊是“自由世界”中唯一忍受“治外法权”束缚的国家，美国驻在希腊的军人及其他人员即使犯下重大罪行也不受希腊法院审理。
    至于希腊与社会主义阵营各国的关系，今天的情况已比三年前有所改善，目前，希腊已与苏联、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、保加利亚、匈牙利和罗马尼亚建立了外交关系。这也是由于国际大势所趋和希腊人民的意志。可以肯定，希腊与新中国建立外交关系为时也不会太远。因为，这是希腊人民的迫切要求，希腊越来越多的政治人物已经懂得，不与人民中国而去与“虚无”的蒋介石国家打交道是不利的。
    塞浦路斯问题
    如果不把塞浦路斯这个重要问题提出来谈一谈，那末对于希腊目前外交政策就无法获得一幅较完整的图画。这个问题涉及英美两国的矛盾。正是美国在1954年唆使贝贝格斯把问题提到联合国的。美国当时的意图是要对英国施加压力，并且尽可能把英国排挤出塞浦路斯。但是把这个问题提到桌面上以后，塞浦路斯岛却爆发了人民反对征服者的武装斗争，事情的发展远超过美国原来的打算。希腊人民以全力支持塞浦路斯人民争取解放的斗争，并且把仇恨转向美国，因为美国奉行着敌视希腊人民正当民族愿望的政策。
    塞浦路斯人民要获得独立自主，还需要作出长期的艰苦斗争。希腊政府已证明，它所奉行的政策是帮助美国政策的成功，而不是保证塞浦路斯岛人民获得自决权。希腊政府有时对美国意志也表示并不那末顺从，这纯然是由于人民的压力。
    经济情况
    希腊至今还是一个经济落后的国家。国民收入以农业为主。工业只有一些轻工业，而且设备陈旧，进行生产的只及生产能力的40％。有两个决定性的因素阻碍着国家工业化：首先，是军事费用的沉重负担。内战结束至今，每年的军事费用占到国家预算50％到60％。这种情况带来的后果是，每年投入生产事业的建设费用还不到整个预算的10％，或国民收入的2％到3％。这笔钱，连用来保养全国公路也不够。其次，美国严格地控制着希腊的经济，不许希腊进行重工业建设。有一个众所周知的事例：德国以赔偿名义交付一座高炉给希腊，但美国阻止希腊接受这座高炉。此外，美国还阻止希腊同人民民主国家和苏联发展贸易和扩大经济关系，尽管苏联曾不止一次宣布它极愿以工业装备与希腊交换农产品和原料。
    由于这种经济政策，希腊的工业品几乎全部要依靠外国输入，而在对外支付上只有依赖不可靠的游历收入和美援。特别是在实行进口自由政策之后外国商品大批涌入希腊，使希腊工业受到了进一步的摧残。
    人民生活
    希腊经济的这种恶劣情况使绝大部分人民生活日益贫困。德拉马（希腊货币名）不断贬值，降低了劳动人民的收入。今天工人的实际工资只及1938年的70％到75％。根据官方统计数字，工业的社会收入75％流入了资本家的腰包，只有25％到工人手里。据总工会（现已落入资本家仆从的改良主义者的手中）的估计，一个工人必须有目前收入的一倍才能维持他家庭最低的生活。因此，十一、二岁的儿童就被迫从事劳动，以弥补家庭开支的不足。肺结核病在劳动群众中十分普遍。
    农民的处境较诸工人更为恶劣，他们的收入一般仅及工人的一半。
    在希腊的八百万人民中，根据官方统计，约有三百万人是贫穷无告的。
               ×××
    以上是今日希腊情况的十分概略的叙述。希腊人民今天正为改变这种情况而斗争着。这个斗争是艰巨的。所有已经取得民族独立和真正民主的各国人民给予希腊人民的援助，对希腊人民说来是十分弥珍可贵的，而且也是必不可少的。
