Xinhua News Agency, 17th. The Ministry of Agriculture of the People's Republic of China issued an urgent notice on the 16th regarding seizing the winter manure accumulation movement. The full text of the notice is as follows:

    Since the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council issued the "Decision on Launching Large-Scale Farmland Water Conservancy Construction and Manure Accumulation Movement This Winter and Next Spring," some regions have already taken action to rapidly launch a winter manure accumulation upsurge. Hebei Province convened a water conservancy and manure accumulation conference. The provincial Party committee determined that the First Secretary would personally oversee water conservancy construction and manure accumulation work, and required the First Secretaries of Party committees at all levels to personally grasp water conservancy and manure accumulation, and to grasp it for a long time, deeply and thoroughly. Shandong Province also convened a representative meeting of socialist agricultural construction activists, and made specific arrangements for vigorously carrying out the water conservancy and manure accumulation movement this winter and next spring, in order to rapidly launch a magnificent and vigorous new production upsurge centered on farmland water conservancy construction, manure accumulation and soil improvement throughout the province, and promote a great leap forward in production. Hubei, Hunan, Guangdong, Jiangxi, Anhui, Gansu, Fujian, and Henan have all successively convened special meetings or issued special instructions, which are of great significance for a bumper agricultural harvest in 1958. However, judging from the overall situation, the upsurge of the manure accumulation movement has not yet been seriously launched in some regions. In order to ensure a bumper agricultural harvest in 1958, it is still necessary to make the greatest efforts to accumulate more fertilizer. It is required that leaders in all regions seize the opportunity, quickly take all effective measures, and, while leading the masses in large-scale water conservancy construction, organize the masses to carry out the manure accumulation movement.

    First, accumulating sufficient topdressing fertilizer for overwintering crops and base fertilizer for spring-sown crops is the general requirement of the winter manure accumulation movement.
    (1) Each province (municipality, autonomous region), special zone, county, district, township, and cooperative must make specific plans for how much fertilizer is needed for each season, each crop, and what are the sources and methods of manure accumulation and fertilizer production, so as to have a clear understanding. Hebei Province requires that the average fertilizer application in the province reach 5,000 jin per mu in 1958, and 10,000 jin per mu in areas with suitable conditions. Jiangxi Province proposes that next year's double-cropping rice should be fertilized with 70 to 80 dan of standard fertilizer per mu, single-cropping rice with 50 dan per mu, and dryland crops with 30 dan per mu (including green manure). Hunan Province requires that from now until the transplanting of late rice next year, a total of 8 billion dan of various fertilizers should be accumulated and produced, reaching an average fertilization of 150 dan per mu. The specific requirements are to accumulate and produce 3 billion dan before the Spring Festival, 3 billion dan before transplanting, for spring-sown crops, and the remaining 2 billion dan in the summer for autumn-sown crops. It is hoped that each province and county will, based on the specific conditions of their respective province and county, propose indicators and measures for manure accumulation and fertilizer production, and urge cooperatives to discuss and implement them.

    (2) There are many ways to accumulate manure in winter. We must pay attention to grasping large fertilizer sources, and not neglect small fertilizer sources. First of all, we must carry out pig raising and manure accumulation activities. This year, the number of pigs raised nationwide has reached more than 118.8 million, but about 40% of the pigs do not have pens. The potential for accumulating manure by raising pigs in pens is extremely huge. All regions should fully utilize the opportunity of slack farming in winter to widely mobilize agricultural cooperatives, adhering to the spirit of running cooperatives diligently and thriftily, using local materials, and vigorously helping cooperative members in difficulty to repair pens for manure accumulation, with the cooperative members repaying in installments from the proceeds of selling pig manure and urine. Recently, due to poor harvests in some areas this year, feed is tight, or because the explanation was not clear when opposing the spontaneous forces of rural capitalism, abnormal phenomena such as increased sales and slaughter of live pigs and falling prices of piglets have been caused; this is not conducive to the development of live pigs and manure accumulation by raising pigs, and it is hoped that all regions will pay attention to inspection and prevention.

    Second, planting winter green manure plays a decisive role in solving the base fertilizer for early rice in some areas. It is necessary to earnestly do a good job in the cultivation and management of green manure, pay attention to ditching, drainage, and frost prevention measures, and strive to increase the fresh grass yield per unit area, so as to achieve the goal of fertilizing two to three mu of farmland with one mu of green manure. Regions with conditions and experience in planting spring-sown green manure should also prepare sufficient seeds and strive to plant more.

    Third, explore and utilize various local fertilizer sources in accordance with local conditions. For example, in the northern regions, emphasis should be placed on promoting the utilization of human manure and urine, and diligently pulling soil and padding pens. In the southern paddy field areas, agricultural cooperatives should be mobilized and guided to universally promote field composting, such as the grass pond mud in Jiangsu and the pond fertilizer in Hunan (pond, that is, composting pond). In mountainous areas, collect straw, fallen leaves, dead grass, etc. for composting. Water network and lakeside areas should use the dry water season in winter to dig river and pond mud and harvest aquatic plants. Coastal areas should organize the salvage of various animal and plant marine fertilizers. The suburbs of cities should actively organize the utilization of miscellaneous fertilizers, human manure and urine, and other urban fertilizer sources.

    Fourth, agricultural cooperatives should formulate perennial manure accumulation plans and cooperative member manure accumulation reward methods. Vigorously promote the advanced manure accumulation experience of "four diligences and eight haves" (diligence in sweeping, diligence in removing, diligence in padding, diligence in burning – burning stove ash and lime, cattle have pens, pigs have sties, fields have seedlings, ponds are available in all seasons, manure has pools, ash has houses, people have toilets, and chickens and ducks have nests), reward manure accumulation labor models, and encourage cooperative members' enthusiasm for manure accumulation in many ways. Collective manure accumulation should be reasonably assessed and points should be counted based on the quality and quantity of fertilizer and the labor expended. For cooperative members' family manure accumulation, it is best to "price according to quality and purchase with cash." Cooperatives with financial difficulties can "price according to quality, record the price in the account, pay in installments, and settle accounts on schedule."

    Fifth, strengthen the leadership of manure accumulation work. It is required that provinces, special zones, counties, districts, townships, and cooperatives regard manure accumulation and fertilizer production as one of the main measures to achieve increased agricultural production, and earnestly grasp it; and designate certain cadres to go deep into key areas, summarize the advanced experience of manure accumulation and increased production, organize visits and exchanges, and promote it.

    It is required that the agricultural departments of each province (municipality, autonomous region) report the progress of the winter manure accumulation movement to the Ministry of Agriculture monthly from November to the beginning of spring plowing next year.

    农业部通知各地抓紧时机采取有效措施
    迅速掀起冬季积肥高潮
    新华社17日讯　中华人民共和国农业部十六日发出关于抓紧冬季积肥运动的紧急通知，通知全文如下：
    自中共中央、国务院发出“关于今冬明春大规模地开展兴修农田水利和积肥运动的决定”后，有些地区已经采取行动迅速掀起冬季积肥的高潮。河北省召开了水利积肥会议，省委确定第一书记亲自掌握水利建设和积肥工作，并要求各级党委第一书记都亲自抓水利和积肥，而且要长期抓，抓深抓透。山东省也召开了社会主义农业建设积极分子代表会议，对今冬明春大力开展水利积肥运动进行了具体部署，要在全省范围内迅速掀起规模壮阔、声势浩大的以兴修农田水利、积肥造肥和改良土壤为中心的新的生产高潮，推动生产大跃进。湖北、湖南、广东、江西、安徽、甘肃、福建、河南都曾先后召开了专门会议或发布了专门指示，这对1958年的农业大丰收具有重大的意义。但是，从总的情况看，积肥运动的热潮在一些地区尚未认真展开。为保证1958年农业大丰收，还须用最大努力增积肥料，要求各地领导抓紧时机，迅速采取一切有效措施，在领导群众大规模兴修水利的同时，组织群众，开展积肥运动。
    第一，积足越冬作物的追肥和春播作物的基肥，是冬季积肥运动的总要求。
      （一）各省（市、自治区）、专区、县、区、乡、社对于各季、各种作物、各需多少肥料、有何积肥门路、如何积肥造肥，都必须做出具体规划，做到心中有数。河北省要求1958年全省肥料平均每亩施肥五千斤，有条件地区要达到一万斤。江西省提出明年双季稻每亩施标准肥七十担到八十担，单季稻每亩五十担，旱地作物三十担（包括绿肥）。湖南省要求从现在起到明年插晚稻时止，全年积制各种肥料八十亿担，达到每亩平均施肥一百五十担，具体要求春节前积制三十亿担，插秧前积制三十亿担，用于春播作物，其余二十亿担在夏季积制，用于秋种作物。希望各省各县都根据本省本县的具体条件，提出积肥造肥的指标和措施，督促各合作社讨论执行。
      （二）冬季积肥门路很广，既要注意抓大宗肥源，也不忽视零星肥源，首先要开展圈猪积肥活动。今年全国养猪数量已达一万一千八百多万头，但是，还有40％左右的猪没有栏圈。圈猪积肥的潜力极其巨大，各地要充分利用冬季农闲时机，广泛动员农业社，本勤俭办社的精神，就地取材，大力帮助困难社员修圈积肥，由社员用出售猪粪尿所得的价款分期偿还。最近，局部地区由于今年年成不好，饲料较紧，或者由于在反对农村资本主义自发势力时解释不清，因而引起不正常的多卖多宰生猪和仔猪价格下跌的现象；这对发展生猪、养猪积肥是不利的，望各地注意检查制止。
    第二，种植冬季绿肥，在部分地区对解决早稻基肥有决定性的作用。必须认真做好绿肥的培育管理工作，注意开沟排灌及防冻措施，力争提高单位面积的鲜草产量，做到种一亩绿肥能肥田两亩到三亩。有条件、有经验种植春播绿肥的地区，还应该备足种子，争取多种。
    第三，因地制宜地挖掘、利用各种地方肥源。例如，北方地区着重提倡利用人粪尿，并且勤拉土，勤垫圈。南方水田地区要发动和指导农业社普遍推行田头沤粪，如江苏的草塘泥、湖南的凼肥（凼，即沤肥池）。山区要搜集秸秆、落叶、枯草等进行堆肥沤粪。水网及滨湖地区要利用冬季枯水时期挖河塘泥、打水草。沿海地区要组织打捞各种动、植物海肥。城市近郊要积极组织利用杂肥、人粪尿和其他城市肥源。
    第四，农业社要制定常年积肥计划和社员积肥报酬办法。大力推广“四勤八有”（勤扫、勤出、勤垫、勤烧——烧灶灰和石灰，牛有栏、猪有圈、田有草子、四季有凼、粪有池、灰有屋、人有厕所、鸡鸭有窝）的先进积肥经验，奖励积肥劳模，从多方面鼓励社员积肥积极性。对集体积肥应该根据肥料质、量和所费劳力，合理评工计分。对社员家庭积肥，最好是“按质论价、现金收买”。资金有困难的合作社可以“按质论价，按价记账，分期付款，按期结账”。
    第五，加强积肥工作的领导。要求省、专区、县、区、乡、社都把积肥、造肥当作实现农业增产的主要措施之一，切实抓紧；并且指定一定的干部，深入重点，总结积肥增产的先进经验，组织参观访问，交流推广。
    要求各省（市、自治区）农业部门从11月份起到明年春耕开始为止，按月将冬季积肥、造肥运动的进展情况报告农业部。
