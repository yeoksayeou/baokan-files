Seize the Favorable Winter Opportunity
Prevent and Control Diseases, Pests, Harmful Birds and Animals
Various diseases and pests will seek a safe place to survive the severe cold in winter, generally unable to move. Because their overwintering places are relatively fixed and they hide for a long time (about five to eight months), it is relatively easy to eliminate them as long as we understand where these diseases and pests overwinter.

Preventing and controlling diseases and pests in winter is inexpensive and effective. In Zhejiang Province, due to years of winter prevention and control of rice borers after liberation, the borer damage rate has gradually decreased, from 15% before liberation to below 5%. In 1956, Luan County, Shanxi Province, combined manure accumulation and composting with the treatment of corn stalks, which not only eliminated overwintering corn borers, but also accumulated a large amount of fertilizer for reproduction. Gaping County, Liaoning Province, has achieved great success in preventing and controlling overwintering cotton bollworms in Lutun District for many years. The damage rate during the flowering period was 25% in 1954, and it dropped to 0.08% in 1957.

Harmful birds and animals come out in winter to find food, with fewer hiding places, which is conducive to capture. Hunting harmful birds and animals in winter, in addition to eliminating the scourge, can also increase the sideline content of agricultural cooperatives.

In winter, the prevention and control of diseases, pests, harmful birds, and animals should be based on local conditions, with priority given to those that cause the greatest harm to crops. Nationwide, rice borers, corn borers, cotton bollworms, fruit tree diseases and insect pests, field mice, wild boars, and sparrows are all key targets for prevention and control. In rice areas, the focus is on eliminating overwintering rice borers. Different countermeasures should be adopted to eliminate overwintering rice borers according to different regions and conditions. In miscellaneous grain areas, various methods such as high-temperature manure accumulation or chopping for feed, fuel, and papermaking raw materials should be adopted to treat corn, sorghum stalks, stubble, and cob axles to completely eliminate overwintering corn borers. In cotton areas, to eliminate overwintering bollworms, we can seize the time around the Spring Festival to remove larvae lurking in cotton storage warehouses and cotton seed and equipment. In fruit tree and vegetable areas, we can use methods such as cleaning the fields, treating residual plants and fallen leaves, and pruning diseased branches to completely eliminate overwintering diseases and insects. In areas with severe bird and animal damage, zinc phosphide poison bait can be used to kill field mice; artificial nest removal and strychnine poison bait can be used to eliminate sparrows; and the masses can be organized to use various methods to capture wild boars, badgers, etc. Locust-prone areas should also do a good job in winter egg survey work.

Agricultural cooperatives in various places must include the prevention and control of diseases, pests, harmful birds, and animals in winter as a part of the agricultural cooperative's winter production and arrange labor appropriately. In order to improve the efficiency of elimination, it is also necessary to explain the importance of this work to the members. Use real-life local examples to illustrate the benefits of winter prevention and control of diseases and pests. Conducting field inspections and organizing visits and discussions are good ways to overcome the masses' paralysis.

In areas with serious bird and animal damage, agricultural departments should contact relevant departments such as local armed forces and supply and marketing cooperatives to promptly supply shotguns, ammunition, and purchase fur. (Wang Bingzhang)

    抓紧冬季有利时机
    防除病虫和害鸟害兽
    各种病虫在冬季都要找个安全的地方躲过严寒，一般不能活动。因为它们过冬的处所比较固定，而且躲藏的时间较长（约五至八个月），只要我们把这些病虫的过冬处所搞清楚，消灭它们是比较容易的。
    在冬季防治病虫害代价小、收效大。浙江省由于解放后连年进行冬季防治稻螟，螟害率逐年减轻，已由解放前15％压低到5％以下。1956年山西省潞安县结合积肥沤粪处理玉米秸秆，不但消灭了过冬玉米螟，同时还积沤了大量肥料投入再生产。辽宁省盖平县芦屯区连年防治过冬棉花红铃虫获得很大成绩，1954年花期被害率是25％，1957年降低到万分之八。
    冬季害鸟害兽要出来寻找食物，隐蔽物少，有利于捕打。在冬季猎打害鸟害兽，除了消灭祸患外，还可以增加农业社的副业内容。
    在冬季防除病虫和害鸟、害兽，应该根据当地具体情况选择对农作物为害最大的首先防治。在全国范围内水稻螟虫、玉米螟、棉花红铃虫、果树病虫害、田鼠、野猪、麻雀等都是防治重点。在水稻地区，以消灭过冬稻螟为主。消灭过冬螟虫应根据不同地区、不同条件，采取不同的对策。杂粮地区应采取高温积肥或铡碎充当饲料、燃料、造纸原料等多种方法，处理玉米、高粱秸杆、根茬、穗轴等，彻底消灭过冬玉米螟。棉区要消灭过冬红铃虫，可在春节前后抓紧清除贮花仓库及处理棉籽，用具内潜伏的幼虫。果树、蔬菜地区，可以用清洁田园、处理残株落叶、剪除有病虫的树枝等方法，彻底消灭过冬病虫。鸟害兽害严重的地区，可以施用磷化锌毒饵诱杀田鼠；用人工掏雀窝和用马前子毒饵消灭麻雀；组织群众用各种办法捕打野猪、?猪、獾等。飞蝗发生地区还要做好冬季查卵工作。
    各地农业社必须把冬季防除病虫和害鸟、害兽，列为农业社冬季生产的一项内容，适当安排劳力。为了提高除治效率，还要向社员说明这项工作的重要意义。以当地的真人真事说明冬季防治病虫的好处。进行田间检查，组织参观座谈，都是克服群众麻痹思想的好办法。
    鸟兽害严重地区，农业部门要和当地武装、供销合作等有关部门联系，及时供应猎枪、弹药和收购毛皮。　（王炳章）
