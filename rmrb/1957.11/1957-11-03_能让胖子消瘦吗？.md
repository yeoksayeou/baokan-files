    Can a Fat Person Become Slim?
    Mu Feng
    The so-called "fat person" mainly refers to someone who is overweight. How do you define overweight? There's a formula for calculating it: Subtract 100 from your height in centimeters. The result is your ideal weight (in kilograms). For example, if you are 170 centimeters tall, your weight should be 70 kilograms, with a fluctuation range of about 5 kilograms, meaning 65-75 kilograms is considered normal. This formula was created by foreigners, so when applying it to Chinese people, it's more appropriate to multiply by 0.9. 70 kilograms multiplied by 0.9 is 63 kilograms, which means 58-68 kilograms is considered neither fat nor thin. If your weight exceeds this standard by 20%, it's considered mild obesity; exceeding it by 40% is considered moderate obesity.
    There are many reasons for obesity, broadly categorized into two types.
    One type is due to the influence of other diseases in the body, such as tumors in the pituitary gland, insufficient thyroid function, or incomplete endocrine function of the gonads, all of which can lead to obesity. These types of obesity each have their own characteristics. For example, obesity caused by pituitary gland tumors results in the most fat on the outer thighs, pelvis, mons pubis, and belly, with less on the limbs, making the hands and feet appear thinner. When a man's gonadal function is incomplete, the buttocks, chest, and abdomen are full, and their personality isn't like that of a normal man. These types of obesity are illnesses and should be treated by a doctor.
    The other type of obesity is due to an "imbalance between income and expenditure" – either the "income" is too high or the "expenditure" is too low. There are many reasons for this type of fat:
      (1) Overeating. Everyone knows that eating too much leads to weight gain, especially eating too much rice, flour, sugars, and beer. This is because these are all carbohydrates, and if there's too much for the body to use, it can be converted into fat and stored.
      (2) Less labor and more sleep can also lead to weight gain. This is caused by reduced expenditure.
      (3) People who like to drink water are also more prone to gaining weight, because water can hinder fat burning.
    Understanding the reasons makes it possible to combat obesity. If it's due to overeating, eat a little less. If you're hungry, eat more vegetables, as vegetables don't make you fat. People who like to drink beer or tea can appropriately reduce their intake.
    Increasing activity is the best way to get rid of obesity. Start with light activities, such as doing daily radio exercises or morning exercises, and sticking to walking (or strolling) for half an hour to an hour, then progressing to various sports activities. Experiments have shown that walking up a 300-meter slope can make the body consume more than 250 grams of fat. More strenuous activities consume even more. However, it's important to note that you shouldn't be too impatient to lose weight, as being too hasty can be overwhelming.
    Regular cold water baths can also help fat people lose weight. However, this should also be done gradually. Start with wiping your body with warm water, gradually lowering the temperature until you're completely showering with cold water.
    When there's really no other option, you can use diuretics to eliminate the water from the fat, because 70% of fat is water. However, people can't take injections and medications forever, so the fundamental way to make fat people lose weight is to "increase activity and reduce income."

    能让胖子消瘦吗？
    木风
    所谓“胖子”，主要是指过胖的人。怎样才算过胖呢？有一个公式可以算：把身长的厘米数减去一百。就是应有的体重（公斤）。比如，你是一百七十厘米高，体重就应该是七十公斤，波动的范围大概是五公斤左右，也就是说，六十五—七十五公斤都算正常。这个公式是外国人算出来的，拿来用在中国人身上，打个九折比较合适。七十公斤打九折是六十三公斤，这就是说五十八—六十八公斤就算不胖不瘦。如果你的体重超过这个标准20％，算是轻度肥胖症；超过40％，算是中度肥胖症。
    肥胖的原因很多，大致分成两类。
    一类是由于体内其他疾病的影响，比如：脑下垂体长瘤子、甲状腺机能不够、生殖腺的内分泌机能不全，都可以使身体肥胖。这种肥胖各有其特色。像脑下垂体长瘤子引起的肥胖是大腿外侧、骨盆、阴阜、肚皮这些地方的脂肪最多，四肢比较少，手、脚显得瘦些。男人生殖腺机能不全时，臀部、胸部、腹部都丰满，性格也不像个正常男人。这些肥胖都是病，应该找大夫治疗。
    另一类肥胖是“收支不平衡”，不是“收入”多了，就是“支出”少了。这一类胖的原因也不少：
      （1）多吃。谁都晓得，吃多了会发胖，特别是多吃米面、糖类、啤酒。因为这些全是碳水化合物，多了身上用不了，可以变成脂肪囤积起来。
      （2）劳动少，多睡觉都可以发胖。这是支出少了引起的。
      （3）爱喝水的人也比较容易发胖，因为水可以妨碍脂肪的燃烧。
    明白了原因，就有办法来对付肥胖了。由于吃多了的，就少吃一点，饿了，可以多吃青菜，青菜不胖人。爱喝啤酒或茶水的人，可以适当减少一些。
    增加活动，是去肥胖的最好的办法。可以从轻度的活动做起，比如，每天做广播体操、早操，坚持散步（或步行）半小时至一小时，以后进而作各种体育活动。实验证明，走上三百公尺的斜坡，可以使身体消耗五两多的油，要是作比较剧烈的活动，消耗更多。可是，要注意一点，求瘦不要过于心急，太急了，可能吃不消。
    经常洗冷水浴，也能使胖子消瘦。不过，这也要顺序渐进。可以从温水抹澡作起，慢慢把温度降低，到完全用冷水淋浴。
    实在没有办法的时候，只有用利尿药把脂肪里面的水份消掉，因为脂肪里面有70％是水。可是，人不可能一辈子打针吃药，所以让胖子消瘦的根本办法还是“增加活动、减少收入”。
