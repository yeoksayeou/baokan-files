"Crops are like a flower, all depending on fertilizer to nourish the family"; "Cultivating land without manure is like groping in the dark." This is the experience of increasing production that Chinese farmers have summed up through long-term practice. Increasing the production of 100 jin of rice requires 2.4 jin of nitrogen, 1.2 jin of phosphorus, and 3.1 jin of potassium; increasing the production of 100 jin of ginned cotton requires 19.3 jin of nitrogen, 7.7 jin of phosphorus, and 14.7 jin of potassium. This is the analysis made by some agricultural science departments. Whether it is the experience of farmers or the experiments of scientific departments, it shows one thing: to increase the unit yield of crops, we must accumulate more fertilizer and apply more fertilizer.

Although farmers in most parts of China attach importance to fertilizer, not every region has applied enough fertilizer to all farmland. Before liberation, farmers had difficulty making a living, and they had neither the ability nor the intention to accumulate large amounts of fertilizer. After liberation, in the years of the individual economy, many farmers were preoccupied with one thing and could not attend to the other, and the strength of accumulating fertilizer was also very limited. After the basic collectivization of the rural areas nationwide, a fertilizer accumulation campaign of unprecedented scale was launched in the vast rural areas during the production upsurge in the winter of 1955 and the spring of 1956. In this period, many regions accumulated several times or even dozens of times more fertilizer than in the past. However, due to the thin foundation of the past, the amount of fertilizer applied in many regions is still insufficient. According to a survey by the agricultural departments, there are still "vegetarian fields" that account for 15% of the cultivated land area in the country and are not fertilized at all. This is a major weakness in China's agricultural production.

The lack of fertilizer is not due to the lack of fertilizer sources. At present, there are 118 million pigs, more than 80 million large draft animals, more than 90 million sheep, and numerous, uncountable chickens, ducks, geese, and other poultry in rural China. These livestock and poultry are good "machines" for making farm manure. According to calculations in Liaoning Province: one pig produces 30,000 jin of manure per year, one horse produces 60,000 jin of manure per year, and one cow produces 190,000 jin of manure per year. China's rural population is about 540 million, and each person excretes about 1,000 jin of feces and urine per year. These are all abundant sources of fertilizer. In addition to these major sources of fertilizer, there are also 50 to 60 million mu of winter green manure in the southern regions, and 11 provinces such as Zhejiang are rich in peat that can be mined and utilized, as well as a large amount of sea fertilizer and algae in coastal and lake areas. There are indeed many sources of fertilizer, but we have not utilized them enough. On a national scale, about 40% of pig manure, human feces and urine, and large livestock manure are not utilized. The average yield per mu of the 50 million mu of winter green manure in the southern regions is only more than 1,000 jin, while the average yield in high-yield areas is several times higher than this. There are many, many other unutilized sources of fertilizer. These are huge potentials for striving to further increase agricultural production.

At present, with the upsurge of the socialist education movement in the rural areas, a new upsurge of agricultural production and construction has begun to emerge. The fertilizer accumulation campaign is an important part of this upsurge. In order to do a good job in fertilizer accumulation, the following issues must be effectively resolved:

First, in addition to collective fertilizer accumulation, agricultural cooperatives must also seize the human and animal manure scattered among the farmers. In the fertilizer accumulation campaign this winter and next spring, it is essential to use collective strength to carry out some fertilizer accumulation activities such as digging pond mud and dredging river mud. However, doing only this is not enough. We must also do our best to accumulate human and animal manure. Each region and each agricultural cooperative should conduct a thorough inspection of whether human and animal manure is fully utilized. The facts of many agricultural cooperatives prove that as long as human and animal manure is fully utilized, the problem of fertilizer shortage can be basically solved or largely solved. The Xinwuzai Agricultural Cooperative in Lianjiang County, Guangdong Province, accumulated all the human and animal manure of the entire cooperative, and all the more than 3,000 mu of land in the cooperative had enough fertilizer to apply. This example illustrates the great significance of paying full attention to the utilization of local human and animal manure.

In order to make full use of human and animal manure, it is necessary to persuade each farmer to accumulate household manure and sell it to the cooperative, and at the same time, it is necessary to solve the labor remuneration for fertilizer accumulation and the fertilizer pricing problem according to the principle of mutual benefit. At present, most of the human and animal manure in rural areas is scattered in the homes of the members. Although many agricultural cooperatives have paid attention to collective fertilizer accumulation, the total amount of fertilizer accumulated in this way is far less than the total amount of fertilizer scattered in the families of the members. Some members have miscalculated in this matter. They always want to use all the manure at home on their private plots, or they always think that the price of the cooperative's purchase of manure from the members is low, or even sell it to some wealthy individual households at a high price. For these members, a debate should be launched in the great debate on agricultural production and construction, using the method of presenting facts and reasoning, so that they can all recognize the principle that patriotism, love of the society, and love of the family must be unified, and know how to do what is truly beneficial to themselves. On the other hand, some agricultural cooperative cadres have also miscalculated in handling this matter. They are unwilling for the cooperative to spend money to buy manure from the members. This cannot concentrate the fertilizer scattered in the families of the members; the result is either that the cooperative has insufficient fertilizer, or it spends money to purchase commercial fertilizer, which increases production costs. Both of these situations are detrimental to the production of agricultural cooperatives. After agricultural collectivization, in the collective fertilizer accumulation work, the labor remuneration for fertilizer accumulation should be reasonably resolved; the purchase of fertilizer from individual members should reasonably resolve the fertilizer pricing problem. To solve these problems, it is necessary to adhere to the principle of mutual benefit and combine the personal interests of the members with the collective interests of the society. Agricultural production leading departments must attach great importance to this work and effectively help agricultural cooperatives do this work well.

Second, fertilizer accumulation work and water conservancy work should be regarded as the two main tasks of agricultural production this winter and next spring that cannot be neglected. As the agricultural proverb says: "With plenty of manure and diligent irrigation, there is no need to ask anyone," water conservancy and fertilizer are two important links in increasing agricultural production. In most regions, they are indispensable. It is essential that the Agricultural Development Program lists them as the first two of the twelve measures to increase production. Because without water conservancy, fertilizer is difficult to fully exert its effectiveness. Without fertilizer, it is difficult to greatly increase production with only water conservancy. Huantai, Shandong, is the county with the most developed water conservancy, but the speed of increasing production is not fast because it has not vigorously developed pig raising and fertilizer accumulation. Shantou Prefecture, Guangdong, which reached the 800 jin per mu grain yield stipulated in the Agricultural Development Program ten years ahead of schedule, is a place where both water conservancy and fertilizer accumulation are done very well. In Chenghai County of this prefecture, the average fertilizer accumulation per mu of paddy field in the county last year reached more than 37,000 jin, and the average application of farm manure per mu of paddy field in Chaoan County in the past two years has been more than 10,000 jin. All units that have significantly increased production have put effort into water conservancy and fertilizer accumulation. At present, in some areas, there is a situation of only focusing on water conservancy and neglecting fertilizer accumulation. It is of course good to speed up water conservancy construction; it is not good to relax fertilizer accumulation work. Understanding the role of water conservancy or fertilizer in increasing agricultural production in isolation, grasping one and losing the other, cannot achieve the goal of greatly increasing production. Some comrades believe that water conservancy construction is subject to seasonal restrictions, and it is too late to do it later, so it should be started as early as possible, and fertilizer accumulation may as well be later. In fact, why does fertilizer accumulation not need to be started immediately? The wheat, rape, green manure crops, etc., sown this autumn all need to be topdressed with one or two applications of fertilizer before winter and around next spring; the vast area of spring-sown crops next year also needs to be applied with enough base fertilizer before sowing. If you don't start accumulating fertilizer immediately, what can you use to meet the needs of agricultural production this winter and next spring? In areas where some people have no toilets and livestock have no pens, building toilets and pens one day earlier can accumulate a lot of fertilizer; delaying it by one day will cause more losses. Furthermore, in order to protect the safe wintering of livestock, sheep, pigs, and other livestock, toilets and pens should be built immediately. Many areas need to make a large amount of compost; if you don't start early, the compost will not be fully decomposed, which will delay the farming season and reduce the effect of increasing production. In any case, it is unfavorable to delay fertilizer accumulation activities, and it must be started immediately like water conservancy work.

Third, fertilizer accumulation work must be regularized starting this winter and next spring. In many areas, in the production upsurge in the winter of 1955 and the spring of 1956, the enthusiasm for fertilizer accumulation was very high, and a lot of fertilizer was accumulated. However, this enthusiasm did not persist, and it slackened after a "boom." The fertilizer accumulation work in many areas last winter and this spring fell into a state of laissez-faire again. Of course, the fertilizer accumulation campaign in the past winter and spring has made great achievements, but relying solely on short-term surprise fertilizer accumulation is not a long-term solution. Many farm manures are produced constantly throughout the year, and the work of accumulating these fertilizers should also be carried out constantly throughout the year. Farmers in many parts of China have the habit of accumulating fertilizer throughout the year, and each agricultural cooperative should attach importance to this good tradition, learn this practice, and list fertilizer accumulation as an important production project of the cooperative throughout the year, and mobilize members to carry it out regularly. To do a good job in the fertilizer accumulation work of agricultural cooperatives, there must be a dedicated person responsible for this work. The animal husbandry director of the management committee of the Huafeng Agricultural Cooperative in Yongji County, Jilin, and the livestock loving committee members of each production team are responsible for leading the fertilizer accumulation. Ten year-round fertilizer accumulation groups have been established in the 14 production teams of the entire cooperative, and the cooperative has also established a system for inspecting fertilizer accumulation work. As a result of this approach, the quantity and quality of fertilizer accumulated by this cooperative this year have reached the level of wealthy middle peasants.

Finally, it is necessary to eliminate various ideological obstacles concerning fertilizer accumulation work through extensive airing of views, big contending and big debating. The fertilizer problem looks simple, but it is actually quite complicated. People often have many different views on whether this or that kind of fertilizer should be used or can be used; there will also be different views on the cooperative's method of collecting fertilizer from members and the remuneration for members' fertilizer accumulation; there is also a dispute in some cooperatives on which is the primary and which is the secondary between farm manure and commercial fertilizer. In some areas, fertilizer accumulation work cannot be carried out well, precisely because a consensus has not been reached on understanding, and there are ideological obstacles. Judging from the situation in some areas, the great debate in the rural areas has provided favorable conditions for solving these problems. These problems have been solved through debate in many areas. The Liming Agricultural Cooperative in Yanshan Township, Lanxi County, Zhejiang, had always used human manure and commercial fertilizer to fertilize the fields, so the members were not very enthusiastic about accumulating pond fertilizer. Many members believed that "pond mud has no fertility, and it is useless to accumulate it"; some members were willing to accumulate pond fertilizer, but said: "The front is a flat slope, and the back is a pebble beach, where can we get pond mud?" After some other members presented the facts that pond fertilizer has been used for many years to increase production, and after finding 28 large and small ponds that can accumulate more than 500,000 dan of fertilizer, those who thought that pond mud had no fertility and those who thought that there was no source of this fertilizer, were all convinced. The same is true on the issue of using more commercial fertilizer or more farm manure. After discussion and calculation, everyone realized that: using more pond mud can reduce costs and increase income, 300 dan of pond mud can top 100 jin of cake fertilizer, and accumulating 100,000 dan of pond mud in the whole cooperative can save 2,000 yuan, which can increase the income of 331 members by 9 yuan per household. The fertilizer problem is also like other problems in the rural areas, the more it is debated, the clearer it becomes. After the debate is clear, the masses have a unified thinking, and they will be more enthusiastic about doing it.

Whether the fertilizer accumulation work is done well this winter and next spring directly affects whether production can be greatly increased next year. We hope that the party committees and agricultural departments in various regions will quickly take up this work, launch a large-scale fertilizer accumulation campaign like the water conservancy construction movement, effectively solve the ideological problems and practical difficulties in the fertilizer accumulation work, fully tap fertilizer sources, and accumulate all the fertilizers that can be used, so as to lay a reliable foundation for the great development of agricultural production next year.

### 鼓起劲来，大量积肥！

    鼓起劲来，大量积肥！
    “庄稼一支花，全靠肥当家”；“种地不上粪，等于瞎胡混”。这是我国农民经过长期实践总结出来的增产经验。增产一百斤稻谷需要二点四斤氮、一点二斤磷和三点一斤钾；增产一百斤皮棉需要十九点三斤氮，七点七斤磷和十四点七斤钾。这是一些农业科学部门所作的分析。不管是农民的经验，还是科学部门的试验，都说明了一个问题：要想提高农作物单位产量，必须多积肥，多施肥。
    我国大部地区的农民虽然重视肥料，但并不是每个地区都已经在所有农田里施用了足够的肥料。解放以前，农民生活下去都很困难，无力也无心大量积肥。解放以后，在个体经济的年月里，许多农民顾了这头顾不了那头，积肥的力量也很有限。到全国农村基本合作化以后，在1955年冬季和1956年春季的生产高潮中，广大农村掀起了规模空前的积肥运动。不少地区在这个时期聚积的肥料比过去每年多几倍甚至十几倍。但是，由于过去的底子不厚，不少地区施肥量仍然不足。据农业部门调查，至今全国还有占耕地面积15％的耕地是根本不施肥料的“斋公田”。这是我国农业生产上的一大弱点。
    缺乏肥料的原因并不是没有肥源。目前我国农村有一亿一千八百万头猪，有八千多万头大耕畜，有九千多万头羊，有为数众多、难以统计的鸡、鸭、鹅等家禽。这些家畜、家禽都是制造农家肥料的好“机器”。根据辽宁省的计算：一头猪每年造粪三万斤，一匹马每年造粪六万斤，一头牛每年造粪十九万斤。我国农村人口约有五亿四千万，每个人每年排泄的粪尿在一千斤左右。这些都是丰富的肥源。在这些大宗肥源以外，南方地区还有五、六千万亩冬季绿肥，浙江等十一个省都蕴藏有可以开采利用的草炭，沿海、湖泊地区还有大量的海肥、水藻等等。肥源的确不少，可是我们利用得非常不够。从全国来说，猪肥、人粪尿、大家畜粪肥约有40％没有利用。南方地区的五千多万亩冬季绿肥每亩平均产量才一千多斤，而高产地区的平均产量比这大几倍。其它还没有利用的肥源，还有很多很多。这些正是争取进一步提高农业生产的巨大的潜力。
    目前，随着农村中社会主义教育运动的高潮，已经开始出现新的农业生产建设的高潮。积肥运动是这个高潮的一个重要的部分。为了把积肥工作做好，必须切实解决以下几个问题：
    首先，农业社除了集体积肥以外，还必须抓紧分散在各农户的人畜粪肥。在今冬明春的积肥运动中，运用集体的力量，进行一些挖塘泥、罱河泥之类的积肥活动，是十分必要的。但是，仅仅这样做是不够的。还必须尽最大努力聚积人畜粪肥。每个地区、每个农业社，都应该对于人畜粪肥是否充分利用进行一次彻底的检查。许多农业社的事实证明，只要把人畜粪肥充分利用起来，缺肥的问题就可以基本解决或是大部解决。广东省廉江县新屋仔农业社，聚积起了全社的人畜粪肥，全社三千多亩田就都有了足够的肥料可施。这一事例说明充分注意利用本地的人畜粪肥有何等重大的意义。
    为了使人畜粪肥得以充分利用，必须说服每个农户把家肥聚积起来卖给合作社，同时又必须根据互利的原则，解决积肥的劳动报酬和肥料作价问题。目前农村的人畜粪肥大部分分散在社员家里。许多农业社虽然注意了集体积肥，但是这样聚集的肥料，远没有分散在社员家庭的肥料总量多。有些社员在这件事情上打错了算盘，他们总想把家里的粪肥都用在自留地上，或者总嫌社里收购社员粪肥的价钱低，甚至以高价卖给某些富裕的单干户。对这些社员，应该在农业生产建设的大辩论中，用摆事实、讲道理的办法展开争辩，使他们都能认清爱国爱社爱家要统一起来的道理，知道怎样做才对自己真正有利。另一方面，有些农业社的干部在处理这件事情上也错打了算盘。他们不愿意由社里出钱收买社员的肥料。这就不能把分散在社员家庭中的肥料集中起来；其结果要就是社里肥料不足，要就是出钱购买商品肥料，使生产成本提高。这两种情况对农业社的生产都是不利的。农业合作化以后，在集体的积肥工作中，要合理解决积肥的劳动报酬问题；收买社员个人的肥料，要合理解决肥料作价问题。解决这些问题，一定要坚持互利原则，使社员的个人利益和社的集体利益结合起来。农业生产领导部门，必须十分重视这个工作，切实帮助农业社把这个工作做好。
    其次，要把积肥工作同水利工作当作今冬明春农业生产的两个不可偏废的主要工作。正如农谚所说的：“粪大水勤，不用问人”，水利和肥料是农业增产的两个重要环节，就多数地区说，它们是缺一不可的。农业发展纲要把它们列为十二项增产措施中的头两项，是十分必要的。因为没有水利，肥料也难充分发挥效用。没有肥料，光有水利也难大大增产。山东桓台是水利最发达的县，但是由于没有大力发展养猪积肥，增产速度不快。提前十年达到农业发展纲要规定亩产粮食八百斤的广东汕头专区，正是水利和积肥都做得很好的地方。这个专区的澄海县，去年全县稻田每亩平均积肥达三万七千多斤，潮安县近两年中稻田平均每亩施农家肥料一万斤以上。各地凡是显著增产的单位，对水利和积肥都是下过工夫的。目前在有些地区开始出现只抓水利、不顾积肥的情况。加紧兴修水利，当然很好；放松积肥工作，这就不好了。孤立地理解水利或是肥料对农业增产的作用，抓一个丢一个，就不能达到大量增产的目的。有些同志认为，兴修水利受季节的限制，迟了不行，因之要及早动工，积肥不妨迟一些。其实，积肥又何尝不需要立即动手呢？今年秋种的小麦、油菜、绿肥作物等，都需要在越冬以前和明年春季前后追施一两次肥料；明年广大面积的春播作物，在播种以前也要施足够的基肥。不立即动手积肥，拿什么东西来满足今冬明春农业生产的需要呢？在一些人无厕所、牲畜无栏圈的地区，早修一天厕所、栏圈，就可以多积很多肥料；多拖延一天，就会多造成损失。再说，为了保护耕畜、羊群、猪只等家畜安全过冬，也应该马上就修厕所、栏圈。许多地区要制造大量的堆肥；如果不早动手，堆肥就不能充分腐熟，就会耽误农时和减少增产的效果。无论从哪方面说，积肥活动迟了都是不利的，必须同水利工作一样立即动手。
    再次，必须从今冬明春开始使积肥工作经常化起来。许多地区在1955年冬季和1956年春季的生产高潮当中，积肥的劲头很大，积的肥料很多。但是这种劲头没有坚持下来，“轰”了一阵子就松懈了。不少地区去年冬季和今年春季的积肥工作又陷于自流状态。当然，前冬去春的积肥运动是有很大的成绩的，但是，光靠短时期的突击积肥，并不是长久之计。许多农家肥料是常年不断在产生的，聚积这些肥料的工作也应该常年不断地进行。我国许多地区的农民都有常年积肥的习惯，每个农业社都应该重视这好的传统，学习这种作法，把积肥列为社里常年的重要的生产项目，发动社员经常进行。要把农业社的积肥工作做好，必须有专人对这个工作负责。吉林永吉县华丰农业社的管理委员会的畜牧主任和各生产队爱畜委员负责领导积肥，全社十四个生产队建立了十个常年积肥组，社里还建立了检查积肥工作的制度。这样作的结果，今年这个社积肥的数量和质量都达到了富裕中农的水平。
    最后，必须通过大鸣大放大辩论来解除关于积肥工作的各种思想障碍。肥料问题看起来简单，实际是相当复杂的。人们对这一种或那一种肥料该不该利用、能不能利用，往往有许多不同看法；对合作社收集社员肥料的办法和社员积肥的报酬也会有不同的见解；农家肥料和商品肥料以哪个为主以哪个为次，在一些社也是有争论的。有些地区积肥工作不能很好开展，正因为认识未取得一致，思想上存在着障碍。从一些地区的情况看，农村的大辩论给解决这些问题提供了有利条件。这些问题，在不少地区通过辩论已经解决了。浙江兰溪县岩山乡黎明农业社以前一贯用人粪和商品肥料壅田，因此社员积塘肥的劲头不大。不少社员认为“塘泥没有肥力，积了也没有用场”；部分社员虽愿意积塘肥，但是说：“前面是平坂，后面石子滩，哪来的塘泥？”在另一些社员摆出历年多用塘肥增产的事实以后，在找出了能积肥五十多万担的二十八个大小水塘以后，认为塘泥没有肥力的人和认为没有这项肥源的人，都口服心服了。在多用商品肥料还是多用农家肥料的问题上也是这样。经过讨论和算账，大家认清了：多用塘泥可以降低成本，增加收入，三百担塘泥能顶饼肥一百斤，全社积十万担塘泥，就可以节约二千元，可以使三百三十一户社员每户增加九元的收入。肥料问题也和农村中的别的问题一样，愈辩愈明。辩明以后，群众思想一致了，干起来劲头也就更大了。
    今冬明春的积肥工作做得好不好，直接影响明年能否大量增加生产。我们希望各地党委和农业部门迅速把这一工作抓起来，像发动水利建设运动一样，展开一个大规模的积肥运动，切实解决积肥工作中的思想问题和实际困难，充分发掘肥源，把一切可以利用的肥料都聚积起来，为明年的农业生产的大发展奠定可靠的基础。
