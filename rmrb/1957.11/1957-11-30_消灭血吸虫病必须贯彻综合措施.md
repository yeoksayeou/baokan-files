Since the National Schistosomiasis Research Committee held its meeting in August this year, various localities have actively trained a large number of grassroots cadres for schistosomiasis prevention and control work, and have convened or are about to convene provincial schistosomiasis prevention and control work conferences to summarize this year's work and make specific arrangements for the prevention and control of schistosomiasis this winter and next spring. They are preparing to take full advantage of the favorable opportunity after the autumn harvest to fight another major battle in the prevention and control of schistosomiasis.

In the past two years, great achievements have been made in the prevention and control of schistosomiasis. Currently, nearly one million patients have been treated nationwide, seven counties have basically eliminated schistosomiasis, and more than one hundred townships have basically eradicated snails. The epidemic area has begun to shrink, and the infection rate has decreased. Many former severely affected areas now show a thriving scene. The broad masses have also come to recognize the harm of schistosomiasis and the benefits of eradicating it, and have mastered prevention and control methods, actively participating in the prevention and control of schistosomiasis. However, judging from the situation in the past two years, the main problem at present is that most regions have not seriously implemented comprehensive prevention and control measures, with some focusing only on snail control, some only on treatment, and some only on feces management, etc.

Currently, among the five links of snail eradication, patient treatment, feces management, safe water use, and personal protection, although some effective methods have been developed for each, they are not all perfect, and many problems remain to be studied and resolved. In other words, we do not yet have the conditions to eliminate schistosomiasis by breaking through any single link. Therefore, under these circumstances, schistosomiasis prevention and control must adopt comprehensive measures. This has been clearly stipulated in every national prevention and control conference and in the State Council's instructions on eradicating schistosomiasis. That is, we must actively prevent and actively treat, eradicate snails, manage feces, and implement personal protection, starting from all aspects, so that various measures interact, complement each other's strengths, and achieve the goal of eradicating schistosomiasis. However, the prevention and control work in some areas currently shows a phenomenon of focusing too much on snail eradication, one-sidedly believing that snail eradication is the key to eliminating schistosomiasis, while not paying enough attention to feces management, patient treatment, and personal protection measures, and relaxing them. This situation should obviously be reversed.

It is undeniable that snail eradication is an important measure for preventing and controlling schistosomiasis. Some experience has been accumulated in snail eradication. As long as we operate according to certain specifications (such as digging deep trenches of more than seven centimeters for soil burial, and compacting after burial; applying pesticides according to different seasons, spraying evenly, etc.) and persist in doing so, snails will gradually tend to be eliminated. In the first half of this year, more than one hundred townships across the country basically eliminated snails. However, according to investigations in the first half of this year, we still do not have enough understanding of the ecological habits of snails. Snails not only live on land and on the surface soil, but also are distributed above and below the waterline. The closer to the waterline, the higher the snail density. A large number of snails live within four chi (å°º, a traditional Chinese unit of length, approximately 1/3 meter) below the waterline, and snails also live in the soil and cracks (including underwater soil), some living in soil as deep as fourteen centimeters. In addition, the snail eradication methods are not yet complete, the epidemic factors of schistosomiasis are extremely complex, and the distribution of snails is extremely wide. Therefore, the view and practice of emphasizing snail eradication while neglecting other measures is not in line with the actual situation.

Judging from the current situation in various localities, personal protection measures (such as wearing protective clothing when working in the water) must be strengthened. In the past period, this work was neglected. It was generally believed that this was a temporary solution, emphasizing difficulties, and lacking methods, so it was rarely carried out, resulting in serious situations of collective acute infection in various places. Because snails and sources of infection cannot be eliminated all at once, and people cannot avoid contact with water in their lives and production processes, if personal protection is not paid attention to while taking other prevention and control measures, it will lead to a situation of treating more than can be cured and preventing more than can be prevented. At present, we have some experience in personal protection. As long as we do a good job in organizational, ideological, and material preparation beforehand, and strengthen scientific and technical guidance, we can avoid or reduce infection and ensure safe production. At the Fourth Hunan Provincial Schistosomiasis Prevention and Control Conference in February this year, it was arranged that attention must be paid to personal protection and feces management when harvesting lake grass. After the meeting, various counties organized relevant departments to form joint offices, formed the members participating in lake grass harvesting into several brigades, teams, and squads, equipped them with leading cadres and prevention and control personnel, and went deep into the site to widely conduct propaganda and education among the masses. Thanks to the above-mentioned series of measures, very few of the 210,000 farmers who participated in lake grass harvesting this spring experienced itchy legs, and no cases of acute onset occurred.

After agricultural cooperativization, most areas have basically carried out feces management. The problem now is that some areas have not done it thoroughly or consolidated it. Feces management has not been carried out according to certain specifications (such as too short storage time, and urban feces being transported to rural areas as fertilizer without treatment, etc.), so that the purpose of eliminating parasite eggs cannot be achieved. Some areas also believe that feces management has many difficulties and is troublesome, and is not as easy as snail eradication, so they have relaxed feces management. Feces management can not only kill schistosomiasis eggs and cut off the transmission route, but also increase fertilizer accumulation and increase fertilizer efficiency. It is an effective measure for eliminating schistosomiasis and developing agricultural production. At the same time, feces management also plays a great role in preventing gastrointestinal infectious diseases and hookworm disease, and should never be relaxed. Carrying out feces management and preventing feces from polluting water sources is an arduous and meticulous task. It is necessary to educate farmers to change their original unreasonable living habits, and it will take a long and repeated period of propaganda and implementation to do it thoroughly and consolidate it. We must never deny the possibility of completely realizing feces management because of insufficient prevention and control experience and the temporary unfamiliarity of the masses when carrying out this work, encountering difficulties and suffering failures. The water-based feces management in Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, and the centralized management by special personnel in the Red Star No. 2 Cooperative of Kunshan County for the past three years have been very solid. This fully shows that other regions under the same conditions are completely possible to do it. Moreover, since this year, feces management technology has gradually become more perfect. Therefore, with the continuous accumulation of prevention and control experience and the improvement of management methods, the masses will gradually get used to it, and feces management will definitely be consolidated.

From 1950 to the first half of this year, nearly one million schistosomiasis patients have been treated nationwide. After treatment, most patients have their symptoms disappear and their physical strength increases. However, at present, both in terms of the quantity and quality of treatment, it is far from meeting the requirements. In order to cure approximately ten million patients as soon as possible, the quantity and speed of treatment must be increased and accelerated year by year. To this end, it is necessary to appropriately develop prevention and control institutions, increase the number of prevention and control cadres, and improve the professional level of prevention and control cadres. More importantly, it is necessary to fully tap the prevention and control potential, further promote mobile treatment in the cooperatives, and make full use of joint clinics, health stations, and folk medical forces, so that schistosomiasis prevention and control work gradually takes root under the guidance of mobile treatment teams. In addition, in combination with production, overall planning should be done, patient queueing work should be done well, the difficulties of patient's work point income and payment of medical expenses during treatment should be properly resolved, and the phenomenon of wasted work in prevention and control institutions during the busy farming season should be overcome. At the same time, treatment work should also pay attention to improving quality and strengthening scientific and technical guidance in order to reduce reactions and prevent the occurrence of deaths.

At present, some people oppose the policy of active prevention and control, emphasizing that prevention and control work should focus on prevention, believing that active treatment is contrary to the principle of prevention first. This view is incorrect. The purpose of schistosomiasis treatment is twofold: one is to eliminate the source of infection, kill adult worms in the body, and prevent the spread of the disease; the other is to restore the health of the patient. Therefore, active treatment does not violate the principle of prevention first, but is a concrete implementation of prevention first. Treatment itself is an inseparable part of preventive measures. If only "prevention" is done, without treatment, or if prevention is emphasized and treatment is neglected, it is one-sided. Therefore, to eradicate schistosomiasis, we must adhere to the policy of active prevention and active treatment.

Schistosomiasis is a parasitic disease shared by humans and livestock. According to investigations in various localities, the infection rate in livestock is no lower than that in humans, especially in cattle, where the infection is most common and serious. Livestock infection with schistosomiasis not only endangers livestock health and even death, causing economic losses, but also acts as a source of infection, endangering humans. If only human schistosomiasis prevention and control is paid attention to and not livestock schistosomiasis prevention and control, the schistosomiasis prevention and control work is only half done, and it is difficult to consolidate the results of human schistosomiasis prevention and control. At present, not enough attention has been paid to the prevention and control of schistosomiasis in livestock. The agricultural sector should organize more veterinary experts, establish necessary specialized research and prevention and control institutions, actively carry out the prevention and control of schistosomiasis in livestock and scientific research, and mobilize the animal husbandry and veterinary departments in epidemic areas to jointly eliminate schistosomiasis that endangers the health of humans and livestock with the health departments.

Implementing comprehensive measures must be adapted to local conditions and combined with agricultural production. The focus of work and the methods of work for each period of prevention and control work should be determined according to the law of agricultural production activities and the applicable time and place of each prevention and control measure. For example, in winter, farmers are relatively idle, the water level is low, and most snails are exposed on the ground. The focus should be on large-scale treatment of all labor force patients and combining water conservancy construction, soil burial, and reclamation to eradicate snails, while at the same time combining with fecal management measures. Summer and autumn are the seasons when farmers are most frequently engaged in production activities such as going into the water to cut grass for fertilizer, transplanting rice seedlings, and applying fertilizer, and the opportunity to be infected with schistosomiasis is the greatest. The focus should be on fecal management and personal protection, combined with treating half-labor force and child patients, and students should be treated during summer vacation. Feces examination work can be carried out throughout the year because it has little impact on production. In this way, it is possible to implement comprehensive measures, prevent one-sided development, and make the prevention and control work have a certain focus in each period, so that the focus can be concentrated on doing a good job in key work. Therefore, all localities should formulate annual and quarterly prevention and control work plans in accordance with the principle of adapting to local conditions and determining the focus of work and specific requirements in different periods, unify arrangements, and make the prevention and control work develop in a comprehensive and balanced manner, implement comprehensive measures, in order to gradually achieve the goal of eradicating schistosomiasis.
