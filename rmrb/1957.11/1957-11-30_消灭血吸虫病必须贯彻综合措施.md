Since the National Schistosomiasis Research Committee held its meeting in August this year, various localities have actively trained a large number of grassroots cadres for schistosomiasis prevention and control work, and have convened or are about to convene provincial schistosomiasis prevention and control work conferences to summarize this year's work and make specific arrangements for the prevention and control of schistosomiasis this winter and next spring. They are preparing to take full advantage of the favorable opportunity after the autumn harvest to fight another major battle in the prevention and control of schistosomiasis.

In the past two years, great achievements have been made in the prevention and control of schistosomiasis. Currently, nearly one million patients have been treated nationwide, seven counties have basically eliminated schistosomiasis, and more than one hundred townships have basically eradicated snails. The epidemic area has begun to shrink, and the infection rate has decreased. Many former severely affected areas now show a thriving scene. The broad masses have also come to recognize the harm of schistosomiasis and the benefits of eradicating it, and have mastered prevention and control methods, actively participating in the prevention and control of schistosomiasis. However, judging from the situation in the past two years, the main problem at present is that most regions have not seriously implemented comprehensive prevention and control measures, with some focusing only on snail control, some only on treatment, and some only on feces management, etc.

Currently, among the five links of snail eradication, patient treatment, feces management, safe water use, and personal protection, although some effective methods have been developed for each, they are not all perfect, and many problems remain to be studied and resolved. In other words, we do not yet have the conditions to eliminate schistosomiasis by breaking through any single link. Therefore, under these circumstances, schistosomiasis prevention and control must adopt comprehensive measures. This has been clearly stipulated in every national prevention and control conference and in the State Council's instructions on eradicating schistosomiasis. That is, we must actively prevent and actively treat, eradicate snails, manage feces, and implement personal protection, starting from all aspects, so that various measures interact, complement each other's strengths, and achieve the goal of eradicating schistosomiasis. However, the prevention and control work in some areas currently shows a phenomenon of focusing too much on snail eradication, one-sidedly believing that snail eradication is the key to eliminating schistosomiasis, while not paying enough attention to feces management, patient treatment, and personal protection measures, and relaxing them. This situation should obviously be reversed.

It is undeniable that snail eradication is an important measure for preventing and controlling schistosomiasis. Some experience has been accumulated in snail eradication. As long as we operate according to certain specifications (such as digging deep trenches of more than seven centimeters for soil burial, and compacting after burial; applying pesticides according to different seasons, spraying evenly, etc.) and persist in doing so, snails will gradually tend to be eliminated. In the first half of this year, more than one hundred townships across the country basically eliminated snails. However, according to investigations in the first half of this year, we still do not have enough understanding of the ecological habits of snails. Snails not only live on land and on the surface soil, but also are distributed above and below the waterline. The closer to the waterline, the higher the snail density. A large number of snails live within four chi (尺, a traditional Chinese unit of length, approximately 1/3 meter) below the waterline, and snails also live in the soil and cracks (including underwater soil), some living in soil as deep as fourteen centimeters. In addition, the snail eradication methods are not yet complete, the epidemic factors of schistosomiasis are extremely complex, and the distribution of snails is extremely wide. Therefore, the view and practice of emphasizing snail eradication while neglecting other measures is not in line with the actual situation.

Judging from the current situation in various localities, personal protection measures (such as wearing protective clothing when working in the water) must be strengthened. In the past period, this work was neglected. It was generally believed that this was a temporary solution, emphasizing difficulties, and lacking methods, so it was rarely carried out, resulting in serious situations of collective acute infection in various places. Because snails and sources of infection cannot be eliminated all at once, and people cannot avoid contact with water in their lives and production processes, if personal protection is not paid attention to while taking other prevention and control measures, it will lead to a situation of treating more than can be cured and preventing more than can be prevented. At present, we have some experience in personal protection. As long as we do a good job in organizational, ideological, and material preparation beforehand, and strengthen scientific and technical guidance, we can avoid or reduce infection and ensure safe production. At the Fourth Hunan Provincial Schistosomiasis Prevention and Control Conference in February this year, it was arranged that attention must be paid to personal protection and feces management when harvesting lake grass. After the meeting, various counties organized relevant departments to form joint offices, formed the members participating in lake grass harvesting into several brigades, teams, and squads, equipped them with leading cadres and prevention and control personnel, and went deep into the site to widely conduct propaganda and education among the masses. Thanks to the above-mentioned series of measures, very few of the 210,000 farmers who participated in lake grass harvesting this spring experienced itchy legs, and no cases of acute onset occurred.

After agricultural cooperativization, most areas have basically carried out feces management. The problem now is that some areas have not done it thoroughly or consolidated it. Feces management has not been carried out according to certain specifications (such as too short storage time, and urban feces being transported to rural areas as fertilizer without treatment, etc.), so that the purpose of eliminating parasite eggs cannot be achieved. Some areas also believe that feces management has many difficulties and is troublesome, and is not as easy as snail eradication, so they have relaxed feces management. Feces management can not only kill schistosomiasis eggs and cut off the transmission route, but also increase fertilizer accumulation and increase fertilizer efficiency. It is an effective measure for eliminating schistosomiasis and developing agricultural production. At the same time, feces management also plays a great role in preventing gastrointestinal infectious diseases and hookworm disease, and should never be relaxed. Carrying out feces management and preventing feces from polluting water sources is an arduous and meticulous task. It is necessary to educate farmers to change their original unreasonable living habits, and it will take a long and repeated period of propaganda and implementation to do it thoroughly and consolidate it. We must never deny the possibility of completely realizing feces management because of insufficient prevention and control experience and the temporary unfamiliarity of the masses when carrying out this work, encountering difficulties and suffering failures. The water-based feces management in Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, and the centralized management by special personnel in the Red Star No. 2 Cooperative of Kunshan County for the past three years have been very solid. This fully shows that other regions under the same conditions are completely possible to do it. Moreover, since this year, feces management technology has gradually become more perfect. Therefore, with the continuous accumulation of prevention and control experience and the improvement of management methods, the masses will gradually get used to it, and feces management will definitely be consolidated.

From 1950 to the first half of this year, nearly one million schistosomiasis patients have been treated nationwide. After treatment, most patients have their symptoms disappear and their physical strength increases. However, at present, both in terms of the quantity and quality of treatment, it is far from meeting the requirements. In order to cure approximately ten million patients as soon as possible, the quantity and speed of treatment must be increased and accelerated year by year. To this end, it is necessary to appropriately develop prevention and control institutions, increase the number of prevention and control cadres, and improve the professional level of prevention and control cadres. More importantly, it is necessary to fully tap the prevention and control potential, further promote mobile treatment in the cooperatives, and make full use of joint clinics, health stations, and folk medical forces, so that schistosomiasis prevention and control work gradually takes root under the guidance of mobile treatment teams. In addition, in combination with production, overall planning should be done, patient queueing work should be done well, the difficulties of patient's work point income and payment of medical expenses during treatment should be properly resolved, and the phenomenon of wasted work in prevention and control institutions during the busy farming season should be overcome. At the same time, treatment work should also pay attention to improving quality and strengthening scientific and technical guidance in order to reduce reactions and prevent the occurrence of deaths.

At present, some people oppose the policy of active prevention and control, emphasizing that prevention and control work should focus on prevention, believing that active treatment is contrary to the principle of prevention first. This view is incorrect. The purpose of schistosomiasis treatment is twofold: one is to eliminate the source of infection, kill adult worms in the body, and prevent the spread of the disease; the other is to restore the health of the patient. Therefore, active treatment does not violate the principle of prevention first, but is a concrete implementation of prevention first. Treatment itself is an inseparable part of preventive measures. If only "prevention" is done, without treatment, or if prevention is emphasized and treatment is neglected, it is one-sided. Therefore, to eradicate schistosomiasis, we must adhere to the policy of active prevention and active treatment.

Schistosomiasis is a parasitic disease shared by humans and livestock. According to investigations in various localities, the infection rate in livestock is no lower than that in humans, especially in cattle, where the infection is most common and serious. Livestock infection with schistosomiasis not only endangers livestock health and even death, causing economic losses, but also acts as a source of infection, endangering humans. If only human schistosomiasis prevention and control is paid attention to and not livestock schistosomiasis prevention and control, the schistosomiasis prevention and control work is only half done, and it is difficult to consolidate the results of human schistosomiasis prevention and control. At present, not enough attention has been paid to the prevention and control of schistosomiasis in livestock. The agricultural sector should organize more veterinary experts, establish necessary specialized research and prevention and control institutions, actively carry out the prevention and control of schistosomiasis in livestock and scientific research, and mobilize the animal husbandry and veterinary departments in epidemic areas to jointly eliminate schistosomiasis that endangers the health of humans and livestock with the health departments.

Implementing comprehensive measures must be adapted to local conditions and combined with agricultural production. The focus of work and the methods of work for each period of prevention and control work should be determined according to the law of agricultural production activities and the applicable time and place of each prevention and control measure. For example, in winter, farmers are relatively idle, the water level is low, and most snails are exposed on the ground. The focus should be on large-scale treatment of all labor force patients and combining water conservancy construction, soil burial, and reclamation to eradicate snails, while at the same time combining with fecal management measures. Summer and autumn are the seasons when farmers are most frequently engaged in production activities such as going into the water to cut grass for fertilizer, transplanting rice seedlings, and applying fertilizer, and the opportunity to be infected with schistosomiasis is the greatest. The focus should be on fecal management and personal protection, combined with treating half-labor force and child patients, and students should be treated during summer vacation. Feces examination work can be carried out throughout the year because it has little impact on production. In this way, it is possible to implement comprehensive measures, prevent one-sided development, and make the prevention and control work have a certain focus in each period, so that the focus can be concentrated on doing a good job in key work. Therefore, all localities should formulate annual and quarterly prevention and control work plans in accordance with the principle of adapting to local conditions and determining the focus of work and specific requirements in different periods, unify arrangements, and make the prevention and control work develop in a comprehensive and balanced manner, implement comprehensive measures, in order to gradually achieve the goal of eradicating schistosomiasis.

### 消灭血吸虫病必须贯彻综合措施

    消灭血吸虫病必须贯彻综合措施
    自从今年8月全国血吸虫病研究委员会举行会议以来，各地积极整训一大批血吸虫病防治工作基层干部，并且召开了或即将召开全省血吸虫病防治工作会议，总结今年的工作和具体安排今冬明春的血吸虫病防治工作，准备充分利用秋收以后的良好时机，在血吸虫病的防治工作方面再打一次大胜仗。
    近两年来的防治血吸虫病的工作是取得了很大的成绩的。目前在全国范围内已有近百万的病人得到治疗，出现了七个基本消灭了血吸虫病的县和一百多个已经基本上扑灭了钉螺的乡；疫区开始缩小了，感染率降低了；不少过去的严重疫区现在已出现了欣欣向荣的气象；广大群众也从认识到血吸虫病的危害和消灭血吸虫病的好处，进而掌握了防治的方法，积极参加了血吸虫病的防治工作。但是，从两年的情况看，目前主要问题在于大多数地区还没有认真贯彻防治的综合性措施，即有的只注重灭螺，有的只注重治疗，有的只重视粪便管理等等。
    目前，在消灭钉螺、治疗病人、管理粪便、实行安全用水和个人防护这五个环节中，虽然已各有了一些有效的方法，但并不都是尽善尽美，尚有很多问题有待研究解决，也就是说，在目前还不具备突破一环就能够消灭血吸虫病的条件。因此，在这种情况下，防治血吸虫病必须采取综合措施。这在每次全国防治会议和国务院发出的关于消灭血吸虫病的指示中，已经明确做了规定。即既要积极预防，也要积极治疗，既要灭螺，也要管理粪便和实行个人防护，从各方面一齐动手，以使各项措施相互作用，取长补短，达到消灭血吸虫病的目的。但是，目前有些地区的防治工作却出现了偏重于灭螺为主的现象，片面认为灭螺是消灭血吸虫病的关键，而对于粪便管理、治疗病人和个人防护措施则重视不够，有所放松，这种情况显然是应当扭转的。
    不可否认，消灭钉螺是防治血吸虫病的一项重要措施，目前在灭螺方面已经积累了一些经验，只要按照一定规格进行操作（如土埋法必须掘深七厘米以上的深沟，埋后打实；药杀必须根据不同季节施用，喷洒均匀，等等）坚持不懈地去做，钉螺就会逐渐趋于消灭。今年上半年全国就出现了一百多个基本消灭钉螺的乡。但是，据今年上半年调查证明，目前我们对于钉螺的生态习性，还了解不够，钉螺不仅生活在陆地上和表土上，而且还分布在水线上下，愈靠近水线，钉螺密度愈高，在水线以下四市尺之内栖居有大量钉螺，土内和裂缝中（包括水下土）也有钉螺生存，有的生活在深达十四厘米的土内。加上灭螺方法尚不完备，血吸虫病的流行因素极其复杂，钉螺分布极为广泛，因此强调以灭螺为主而忽视其它措施的看法和做法是不切合实际情况的。
    就目前各地情况来看，个人防护措施（如下水生产工作时穿防护衣裤）必须加强。在过去一段时间里，这一工作是被忽视的。一般都认为这是治标的办法，强调困难，加上缺少办法，所以很少开展，以致各地不断发生集体急性感染的严重情况。由于钉螺和传染源不能一下子消灭，人们在生活和生产过程中又不能避免同水接触，如果在采取其他防治措施的同时，不注意个人防护，就会造成治不胜治，防不胜防的局面。目前，在个人防护方面我们已经有了一些经验，只要事先做好组织上、思想上和物质上的准备工作，并加强科学技术指导，就能够避免或减少感染，保证安全生产。今年2月湖南省第四次全省防治血吸虫病会议上，即将打湖草必须注意个人防护和粪便管理做了布置。会后各县都组织有关部门成立联合办公室，将参加打湖草的社员组成若干大队、中队和小队，配备领导干部和防治人员，深入现场，在群众中广泛进行宣传教育。由于采取上述一系列措施，今春参加打湖草的二十一万农民极少发生腿痒现象，亦无急性发作的病例发生。
    在农业合作化后，多数地区基本上进行了粪便管理。现在的问题是有些地区做得还不彻底，还不巩固，粪便管理未能按照一定规格进行操作（如贮存时间太短，城镇粪便未经处理即运往农村作肥料等等），以致不能达到消灭虫卵的目的。也有的地区认为粪便管理困难多，又麻烦，不如灭螺容易，因而放松了粪便管理。粪便管理不仅能杀死血吸虫卵，切断传染途径，而且能够增积肥料，增加肥效，是消灭血吸虫病和发展农业生产的一项有效措施。同时粪便管理对预防肠胃传染病、钩虫病也有很大作用，绝不应当放松。开展粪便管理、防止粪便污染水源是艰巨而细致的工作，必须教育农民改变原来的不合理的生活习惯，需要经过长期和反复宣传、施行才能做得彻底，才能得到巩固，绝不能因为进行这一工作时，由于防治经验不足和群众一时的不习惯，碰到困难和遭到失败就否定彻底实现粪便管理的可能性。江苏镇江三年来的水上粪便管理和昆山县红星二社的分点集中、专人负责管理，到目前都很巩固。这充分说明同样条件下的其他地区是完全可能做到的。况且，今年以来，在粪便管理技术上也逐步趋于完善，因此，随着不断积累防治经验和改进管理方法，群众逐渐习惯，粪便管理是一定会得到巩固的。
    自1950年到今年上半年，全国共治疗了近百万血吸虫病人，大多数病人经过治疗以后，症状消失，体力增加。但是，目前无论从治疗的数量和质量方面来看，都远远不能满足要求。为了尽快地治好一千万左右的病人，治疗的数量和治疗的速度必须逐年增多和加快。为此，需要适当地发展防治机构，增加防治干部，提高防治干部的业务水平；更重要的是需要充分挖掘防治潜力，进一步推行巡回驻社治疗，充分运用联合诊所、保健站和民间的医疗力量，使血吸虫病防治工作逐步在巡回治疗组的指导下生根；并结合生产，全面规划，做好病人排队工作，妥善解决病人治疗期间的工分收入和缴纳医药费的困难，克服防治机构在农忙季节出现的窝工现象。同时治疗工作还应当注意提高质量，加强科学技术指导，以减少反应和防止死亡事故的发生。
    目前，有些人反对积极防治的方针，强调防治工作应以预防为主，认为积极治疗是违背预防为主的原则。这种看法是不正确的。血吸虫病治疗的目的有二，一是为了消灭传染源，杀死体内成虫，使其终止排卵，预防病害扩大流行；另一个目的是为了恢复病人的健康。因此，积极治疗并不违背预防为主的原则，而是预防为主的具体贯彻，治疗本身是预防措施不可分割的组成部分。如果光“预防”、不治疗或者重预防、轻治疗，都是片面的。因此，消灭血吸虫病必须坚持积极预防和积极治疗的方针。
    血吸虫病是人和牲畜共有的寄生虫病。据各地调查证明，在牲畜中的感染率并不低于人，其中尤以牛的感染情况最普遍、最严重。牲畜感染血吸虫病不仅危害牲畜健康，甚至死亡，造成经济上的损失，而且还起着传染源的作用，危害人类。如果只注意人体血吸虫病的防治而不注意牲畜血吸虫病的防治，血吸虫病防治工作只算做了一半，对于人体的血吸虫病的防治成果也很难于巩固。目前，对于牲畜血吸虫病的防治还未引起足够重视。农业部门要组织更多的兽医专家，成立必要的专门研究和防治机构，积极开展防治牲畜血吸虫病和科学研究工作，并动员流行地区所属畜牧兽医部门，同卫生部门共同消灭危害人体和牲畜健康的血吸虫病。
    贯彻综合措施必须因时因地制宜，并且和农业生产相结合。应该根据农业生产活动的规律和每项防治措施的适用时间、地点，确定防治工作每个时期的工作重点和进行工作的方式。例如冬季农民较闲，水位低落，大部分钉螺暴露在地面上，就应当以大规模治疗全劳动力病人和结合兴修水利、土埋、开垦灭螺为重点，同时结合进行粪便管理措施。夏秋季为农民下水割草积肥、插秧、施肥等生产活动最频繁而感染血吸虫病机会最多的季节，就应以粪便管理和个人防护为重点，结合以治疗半劳动力和儿童患者，暑假则治疗学生患者。粪便检查工作由于对生产的影响不大，全年都可以进行。这样就能够做到既贯彻了综合措施，防止片面发展，又能使防治工作在每个时期都有一定的重点，便于集中力量把重点工作做好。因此，各地都应该根据因地因时制宜的原则，定出年度和季度防治工作规划，确定不同时期的工作重点和具体要求，统一安排，使防治工作全面平衡发展，贯彻综合措施，以期逐步达到消灭血吸虫病的目的。
