Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 16th – Antara News Agency reports that the Makassar "People's Guide" newspaper reported on the 15th that the people of major cities and regions in West Irian, including Sorong, Biak Island, Dutch Tia, and Merauke, are prepared to launch an uprising to demonstrate to the world that they are unwilling to continue living under the oppression of the Dutch colonialists. The newspaper stated that many people connected with the preparations for the uprising have been detained by the Dutch authorities. Dutch police authorities have reportedly received orders to detain these individuals until the United Nations General Assembly has discussed the West Irian issue.

The newspaper also revealed that since October, Dutch troops and police stationed in West Irian have been strengthening their defenses everywhere. Coastal areas are heavily guarded, and airplanes and warships patrol the sea to counter so-called "infiltration by Indonesian troops."

The above information was relayed to the "People's Guide" reporter by patriots who fled from West Irian to Soasiu. Soasiu is the capital of West Irian Province, established by the Indonesian government on Tidore Island, west of Irian Island.

    不愿再忍受荷兰的奴役
    西伊里安人民准备起义
    新华社雅加达16日电  据安塔拉通讯社报道，望加锡“人民指南报”15日报道，西伊里安的梭弄、别克岛、荷兰蒂亚和马老奇等主要城市和地区的人民已准备发动起义来向全世界表示，他们不愿继续在荷兰殖民者的压迫下生活下去。这家报纸说，许多同起义的准备工作有关系的人已经被荷兰当局拘禁。荷兰警察当局曾经接到命令，要把这些人一直拘留到联合国大会讨论了西伊里安问题以后。
    这家报纸还揭露，从10月份起，驻在西伊里安的荷兰军队和警察已经到处加强戒备，海岸地区有重兵把守，飞机和军舰在海上往来巡逻，以对付所谓“印度尼西亚部队的渗入”。
    上述情况是从西伊里安逃到索阿修的爱国者告诉“人民指南报”记者的。索阿修是印度尼西亚政府设在伊里安岛西面第多列岛上的西伊里安省省会。
