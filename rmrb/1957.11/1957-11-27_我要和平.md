    I Want Peace
    I wholeheartedly and firmly support the Peace Manifesto.
    War brought me immense suffering. War caused me to lose my mother, war caused me to lose my father, war caused me to lose my older brother, war caused me to lose the warmth of family that everyone should enjoy. And my parents—two ordinary Communist Party members—precisely for the sake of our peaceful and happy life today, fought against the warmongers, gloriously sacrificing their precious lives. We absolutely will not allow anyone to destroy our peaceful, happy life.
    I have read the "Peace Manifesto" carefully, again and again, and every sentence touches my heart. I cannot forget the disasters and misfortunes that war brought to me and to more people who share my fate, I cannot forget my parents and more people who shed blood and sacrificed themselves for peace.
    I want to shout to the people of the world: Arise, support the "Peace Manifesto," and safeguard world peace! Do not let the disaster of war descend upon the world again!

### 我要和平

    我要和平
    我衷心地、坚决地拥护和平宣言。
    战争曾经给我带来极大的不幸。战争使我失去了母亲，战争使我失去了父亲，战争使我失去了哥哥，战争使我失去了每个人所应当享受的家庭温暖。而我的父母——两个普通的共产党员正是为了我们今天和平幸福的生活同好战者斗争，光荣地献出自己宝贵的生命的。我们绝不允许任何人来破坏我们的和平、幸福生活。
    我一遍又一遍地仔细阅读了“和平宣言”，每一句话都打动我的心。我不能忘记战争带给我以及更多和我同命运的人们的灾难和不幸，我不能忘记我的父母和更多为了和平而流血牺牲的人。
    我要向全世界人民大声呼吁：起来，拥护“和平宣言”，维护世界和平！不让战争的灾难再次降到人间！
