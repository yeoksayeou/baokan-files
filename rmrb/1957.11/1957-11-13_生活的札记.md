    Notes on Life
    Léi Jiā

    A long time ago, a steel mill director said to me:
    "Comrade, I'm talking about you—writers. Why do you come to the masses and pull out your notebooks as soon as you see me, as if I am... One day, the open-hearth furnace needed hot repairs, and four bricks fell down. Three fell first, and when I crawled in, another one fell, almost hitting me on the head. My clothes were soaked with sweat inside and almost scorched outside. As soon as I crawled out, uh, there was a writer who asked me: 'Director, how do you feel?' What could I say? I replied: 'First, the falling bricks shouldn't hit me; second, the four silica bricks must be sent in quickly and cemented well; third, are the tools ready? Fourth, I need to know exactly what time the repairs can be finished; fifth...' What else could I say to him? I hurried away, which was of course a bit impolite. If he kept bothering me like that, I would have burst with anger, and how could I complete the task?"
    This story is widely circulated. I often take it as a warning, and this kind of interview-style attitude towards life has long been criticized.
    A literary worker, as the director pointed out, should first of all integrate with the masses.
    Those steelworkers standing in front of the open-hearth furnace may seem crude and ignorant to the writer; but they were first moved by the director's actions and then increased their confidence in repairing the furnace. Only when one of them becomes a writer, and also wants to create a typical un-reformed intellectual, would he write such an uncultivated question.
    These are two completely different thoughts and feelings.
    If the writer could follow the director and also crawl into the open-hearth furnace, his question to the director would not only become unnecessary, but when the steelworkers were repairing the furnace roof under high temperature, he would also experience the workers' labor emotions and their great significance. In this way, he could connect with the workers heart to heart, or at least he would be understandable to the worker masses at this time.
    Participating in grassroots work and throwing ourselves into the fiery struggle is of paramount importance to us. In practice, that is, in the process of integrating with the masses, the four words "mass line" are no longer terms in discussion meetings, but the most basic principles guiding our actions.
    In 1945, the Party asked me to take over a factory. At that time, it was a war environment, our regime had just been established, the factory had been damaged by the Japanese, and the worker masses were under the control of the "Management Committee" (which included foremen, translators, and had very complex components). As for me, I didn't understand technology or factory management; but I was ordered to start work as soon as possible, because this factory had to bear a huge financial burden in the war. I went to that factory alone. Who were the basic masses? Where did the cadres come from? How were the technical problems solved? I knew I had to rely on the army, the government, and especially the policies and principles that the Party taught me. However, I appeared extremely small in front of the machines, and I didn't have enough confidence in this arduous task. Similarly, I was insignificant when I stood in front of the workers; however, at the same time, it gave me such an important enlightenment. The great power of the working class said to me: "Rely on me, rely on me tightly!" And this is the mass line policy that the Party educated me on. I understood that resuming work and the mass movement must be carried out at the same time, and I understood that only through the mass line could I solve all the problems that I thought were not easy to solve.
    As mentioned above, the four words "mass line" were just a term in the study documents for me in the past, and I didn't have practical experience with it.
    I thank the Party for giving me the opportunity to practice. This is the first lesson of my life.
    I still clearly remember how I promoted the first cadre. After I arrived at the factory, I was received coldly by the "Management Committee"; but the next day I called them to a meeting and directly raised the issue of resuming work and dividing the work. I was not yet familiar with the workers, and I couldn't set up another organization to replace this organization. I could assign them more or less important tasks based on their different experiences and performances. The main thing was that the mass movement that was about to be launched could not only supervise their current work, but also settle their past. During the conversation, I discovered a middle-aged man squatting at the door. He had his shoulders hunched, a long beard on his chin, a thin face, and red eyes, looking malnourished and tired. He rarely spoke and was not a member of the "Management Committee." Who was he? I asked: "Who are you?" He replied: "Self-defense captain!" I asked again: "Which workshop?" "Paper-copying worker." "Are you educated?" "I went to senior elementary school." "Do you want to take on a job?" "Me? Humph..." He didn't say any more. But these few sentences were enough. The self-defense captain was originally a hard job, and he represented the interests of the masses. I thought he must be someone who was looked down upon by those committee members but supported by the masses. The tone of his last sentence also fully proved this, as if to say: "You have arranged all of them, what else do you want me to do?" He didn't expect that I really needed him, him, the person who opposed those committee members. At that time, I assigned him to be the secretary. This was the only way after all the work positions were assigned.
    Obviously, this was just the beginning. Later, I observed and cared for him anytime, anywhere. He passed all the tests; completed all the tasks, and always stood at the forefront of the struggle. He grew up with the new things. When he truly became a leader in the eyes of the masses, he was no longer the oppressed worker he used to be, but became the master of the factory, and a person who embodied the Party's policies and was closely related to the masses.
    This figure growing in real life is prescribed by objective needs. He has a deep social foundation, which gives him unlimited development prospects. It would be very difficult to understand him apart from this specific environment. The object of my expectation was not primarily a character in the novel I wanted to write. Most importantly, I wanted to complete the Party's task of resuming work, production, and the preparations for the subsequent retreat through him.
    From the perspective of the Party's work, he was a link between the Party and the masses. From my personal point of view, he was my indispensable work assistant. I wanted to implement the democratization of enterprise management, carry out class education, establish a sense of ownership, and at the same time strengthen labor discipline through him and all the worker cadres. In fact, this is democratic centralism. The reward and punishment system in the factory is the embodiment of criticism and self-criticism; labor models are the banners of progress erected by the working class. In other words, all of this is to establish the leadership of the Communist Party.
    Socialist writers must not only describe these worker heroes from the above aspects, but before being writers, they must first become skilled mass workers, and first live and grow together with these heroes.
    In fact, it is also the case. The test I gave to that paper-copying worker was also a test for myself. How I asked him, I also asked myself. I put him under the supervision of the masses for a long time, and I had to do the same myself. Otherwise, my words would lose persuasiveness to him.
    I relied on him, and he and I had to rely on the masses. How well the mass line policy was implemented depended on how well the masses were mobilized, how many worker cadres were promoted from the masses, production results, and preparations for the retreat. At that time, we overfulfilled the task every month, transported the machines during the retreat, and preserved a large number of cadres. We stopped production on the first day of the retreat, and before that, when he inspected the preparations for the base area and returned from the upper reaches of the Yalu River, he was officially appointed as the deputy director of the factory by the provincial government. He was one of the two workers in that region who was promoted to deputy director at that time.
    Needless to say, all the members of the "Management Committee" collapsed. Some were liquidated by the masses in the struggle against foremen; some were passively slack in production and finally wavered during the retreat; and some even surrendered to the enemy after the Kuomintang reactionaries occupied the city. One of them was like this. He used to be a foreman who admitted his guilt to the workers and then got a job opportunity. He volunteered to follow the retreat; but on the first day of the retreat, he said to me while crying sadly that his family was too big and he really couldn't follow the democratic government; at the same time, he asked for more food on the same pretext. Indeed, he got twice as much food as others. Unexpectedly, as soon as the Kuomintang came, he became the search captain and asked the workers who didn't follow the retreat to return the food that the democratic government had distributed to them before the retreat. Seven months later, we liberated the city for the second time. This traitor, again shedding false tears, said to me hypocritically as soon as he met me: "Director! It would have been better if you had come back three months later, then they (referring to the Kuomintang) would have repaired the factory!"
    At that time, I didn't quite understand his words. His use of such words to welcome us showed his state of mind at that time. If a person sincerely hopes that we will come back and get a factory to start work, can it be said to be bad? But this sentence was still a bit jarring and could not be understood by people who have a common language. When the anti-traitor movement went deeper step by step, and his crimes were revealed one by one, I understood the essence of this sentence. This is the most concentrated expression of his evil thoughts and behaviors, what a vivid and profound confession!
    I will never forget this sentence. When I visited worker families and saw the miserable life caused by the Kuomintang, I thought of this sentence. When I heard workers complaining at mass meetings, I thought of this sentence again. At that time, as when I first took over the factory, the anti-traitor and the second resumption of work were carried out at the same time. At the anti-traitor meeting, this sentence gave me and the worker masses great hatred, and later in the more arduous work of organizing the resumption of work, I and the worker masses gained great confidence because of increased awareness.
    In this period of practical work, I only began to understand a little bit of the laws of the mass movement, a little bit of the basic knowledge of factory management, began to understand the worker masses, and began to understand life. Don't be afraid of having little, but afraid of having nothing at all. Since this is the first step, there will be a second step, towards the road of self-transformation that becomes wider as you walk for a long time.
    A working-class writer must first undergo ideological training like a Communist Party member. After learning Marxism-Leninism, a Communist Party member must first go through practice. This is already a well-known basic common sense required in the "Speech at the Forum on Literature and Art" in the path of creation.
    "Letting a hundred flowers bloom" is proposed by the Party based on objective reality, because today's rich and colorful life is itself a large garden with colors and fragrance.
    The new relationships between people and the new working methods in the new society have provided extremely convenient conditions for writers. For example, we often hold meetings in our work. When we cannot explore the history and work of each person one by one, we can intercept a cross-section at any work meeting. Forestry personnel can study the growth of trees based on the annual rings, and an experienced writer can also study people and the relationships between people in the meeting. Also, we often divide a work into steps such as deployment, pilot, and promotion, which provides favorable conditions for writers to understand and study typical environments, and the summary is also needed by writers when summarizing various phenomena. We must not forget the appraisal meeting, which occupies an important position in our lives. It analyzes and appraises people according to the moral qualities of the new society. When a writer observes and studies people, how much material for character description is provided here. We should not forget the labor models and advanced workers who are constantly emerging in the construction of socialist society. Their deeds are an inexhaustible source for us to shape heroic characters. As long as we are willing to be a working-class writer and are determined to devote ourselves to real life, what the torrent of life will bury are those who have heavy burdens, and definitely not those who want to put on the glorious title of working-class writer.
    Life is our school. Working hard seriously is absolutely incompatible with being fake. Either be a promising writer, or you will always only ask stupid questions like "Director, how do you feel?" Even if you pretend to be cultivated and carefully avoid asking like this, when you and the director who crawled through the open-hearth furnace walk out of the workshop side by side, when the director's sweaty clothes make him shiver coldly, you might say: "No, Director, aren't you sick?" Look, this is another laughably stupid question.

    生活的札记
    雷加
    很久以前，一位炼钢厂厂长对我这样说道：
    “同志，我说的是你们——作家们，为什么不到群众中去，见了我就掏出本子来，仿佛我是……有一天，平炉要热修，掉下四块砖。先掉下三块，我爬进去的时候，又掉下一块，差点砸在我的头上。我的衣裳，里面被汗湿透了，外面又几乎烤焦了。我刚爬出来，呃，就有这么一位作家，向我问道：‘厂长同志，你有什么感觉？’我怎么说呢？我答道：‘第一，掉下来的砖不要打了我，第二，要赶快把四块硅砖送进去，砌好，还有第三，工具预备好了没有？第四，我要准确地知道几点钟可以修好，第五……’我还能对他说什么呢？我匆匆地走开了，这当然有点不礼貌。如果他尽这样缠着我，我就要气破肚子，还怎么完成任务呢？”
    这个故事，流传很广。我常以此为戒，并且这种采访式的生活态度，也早已受到了批判。
    一个文艺工作者，应该像这位厂长所指出的，首先要与群众相结合。
    站在平炉跟前的那些炼钢工人，在这位作家眼中也许是粗野无知的；但他们却是先为厂长的行动所感动，又因此增加了修理平炉的信心。只有当他们之中有一位成为作家，并且又要创造一个未经改造的知识分子典型时，他才会写出那样一句没有修养的问话的。
    这是截然不同的两种思想和感情。
    假如这位作家，能够跟在厂长后面也钻进这座平炉，他对厂长的问话，不但成为不必要，当炼钢工人在高温下修砌炉顶时，他也就会体验到工人的劳动感情和它所具有的伟大意义。这样，他才能和工人心心相通，至少，他对工人群众这时才是可以理解的了。
    参加基层工作，投入火热斗争中去，对我们来说，具有头等重要意义。在实践中，即与群众结合的过程中，群众路线四个字，不再是讨论会上的术语，而是指导我们行动的最基本的原则。
    1945年，党叫我去接收一个工厂。当时是战争环境，我们的政权还刚刚建立，工厂遭到日本人的破坏，工人群众在“保管委员会”（其中有工头，有翻译，成份非常复杂）把持之下，至于我，一不懂技术，二不懂工厂管理；但命令我尽速开工，因为这个工厂必需负担在战争中的极大的财政任务。我一个人到那个工厂去了。基本群众是谁呢？干部从哪里来呢？技术问题又怎样解决呢？我知道必需依靠军队，依靠政府，尤其要依靠党教给我的政策和原则。但是，我在机器面前，显得极其渺小，我对这个艰巨的任务，没有充分信心，同样，我站在工人面前时，也是微不足道的；不过，同时它又给了我一个多么重要的启示，工人阶级的伟大的力量这样对我说：“依靠我，紧紧地依靠着我！”而这也就是党教育我的群众路线的方针。我懂得了复工与群众运动必需同时进行，我懂得了只有通过群众路线，才能解决我认为不易解决的一切问题。
    像上面说的，群众路线这四个字，过去对我来说，只是学习文件上的一个名词，我对它并没有实践的经验。
    我感谢党给了我实践的机会。这就是我的生活的第一课。
    我还清楚地记得我是如何提拔了第一个干部的。我到工厂后，受到了“保管委员会”的冷淡；可是第二天我就找他们开会，直接提出复工和分工的问题。我对工人还不熟悉，我不能成立另一个组织来代替这个组织，我可以根据他们的不同经历和表现，来分配他们较重要或不重要的工作，主要的是即将开展的群众运动，不但可以监督他们目前的工作，还要清算他们的过去。谈话中我发现了蹲在门口的一个中年人。他抱着肩，下巴上有很长的胡须，面孔清瘦，而且双眼发红，一副既缺乏营养又劳累的样子。他很少发言，也不是“保管委员会”的委员，他到底是谁呢？我问：“你是谁？”他答：“自卫队长！”我又问：“哪个车间的？”“抄纸工人。”有文化吗？”“读过高小。”“你要担个什么工作吧？”“我？哼……”他不说了。只是这几句对话也就很够了。自卫队长原是个吃苦的差事，又是代表群众利益的，我想他一定是被那些委员们瞧不起而又被群众所拥护的一个人。从他最后一句话的口气里，也充分证明了这一点，好像说：“你把他们都安插了，还要我干什么呢？”他没有想到我真正需要的正是他，他这个反对那些委员的人。当时我分配他做秘书。一切工作岗位分配完了之后，这是唯一的办法。
    显然，这只是个开始，以后我随时随地观察他和关心他。他通过了一切考验；完成了各项工作，永远站在斗争的最前列。他是和新生的事物一同生长起来的。当他在群众心目中真正成为领袖时，他已经不是从前的那个被压迫的工人，变成了工厂的主人，而是一个体现党的政策与群众血肉相关的人了。
    在现实生活中生长着的这个人物，是客观需要所规定的。他既有深厚的社会基础，才又给予他以无限的发展前途。脱离这个具体环境去了解他，就会非常困难。　　我对他的期待，先不是我要描写的小说中的人物，最重要的，我要通过他完成党交给我的复工、生产和继之而来的撤退的准备工作。　　从党的工作来看，他是党与群众之间的一根纽带，从我个人来说，他是我不可少的工作助手。我要通过他和所有的工人干部，实行企业管理的民主化，进行阶级教育，树立主人翁思想，同时加强劳动纪律。实际上，这就是民主集中制。工厂里的奖惩制度，就是批评与自我批评的体现；劳动模范，就是工人阶级树立起来的前进的旗帜。换一句话说，这一切就是要确立共产党的领导。　　社会主义社会的作家，不但要从以上各个方面来描写这些工人英雄，作为作家之前，作家们必需先成为一个群众工作的能手，先和这些英雄们一起生活，一起生长。
    事实上也是如此。我给那个抄纸工人的考验，也就是给我自己的考验。我怎样要求他，也就怎样要求自己。我长久地把他放在群众监督之下，而我自己更要如此。否则，我的话对他就会失去说服力。
    我依靠他，我和他又必需依靠群众，群众路线这个方针执行得如何，要看群众发动的怎样，要看从群众中提拔了多少工人干部，要看生产成绩，要看撤退的准备工作。当时，我们每月超额完成了任务，在撤退时运走了机器，保存了大批干部。我们是在撤退的头一天才停止生产的，而他，在这以前，当他视察了根据地的准备工作由鸭绿江上游归来时，就由省政府正式任命为副厂长了。他是那个地区当时由工人提升为副厂长的两个之中的一个。
    不用说：“保管委员会”所有的委员都垮台了。有的在反工头斗争中被群众清算了；有的在生产中消极怠工，最后在撤退时动摇了；甚至有的在国民党反动派占领了这个城市之后还向敌人投降了。其中一个，就是这样。他原是一个把头，向工人低头认罪之后又得到了工作机会。他自动报名愿意跟着撤退；但撤退的头一天，他一边伤心地哭着一边对我说，他的家口太多，实在不能跟着民主政府走；同时又以同样的借口，要求多发一些粮食给他。的确，他比别人多得了一倍粮食，想不到国民党一来，他就做了搜查队长，向没有跟着撤退的工人要回民主政府临撤退时发给他们的粮食。七个月之后，我们又第二次解放了这个城市，这个叛徒，又流着虚伪的眼泪，见面第一句话对我假惺惺地说道：“厂长呵！你们晚回来三个月多好，那时他们（指国民党）就会把工厂修好了！”
    当时，我不太懂他的话。用这样的话欢迎我们，表现了他当时的思想状态。如果说一个人衷心希望我们回来得到一个开工的工厂，能说不好吗？但这句话终究有些刺耳，不是具有共同语言的人所能理解的。当反奸运动一步一步深入，他的罪状一件一件揭露之后，我才懂得了这句话的本质的东西。这是他的罪恶思想行为的最集中的表现，这是一句多么逼真，多么深刻的自供状呵！
    我永远忘不了这句话。我访问工人家庭看到了国民党所造成的悲惨生活时，想起了这句话。我听见工人在群众大会上诉苦时，又想起了这句话。当时，与我刚接收工厂时同样，反奸和第二次复工是同时进行的。在反奸大会上，这句话给我给工人群众以极大的仇恨，以后在更艰巨的复工组织工作中，我和工人群众由于提高了觉悟，才产生了极大的信心。
    在这一段实际工作中，我只是开始懂得了一点点群众运动的规律，一点点工厂管理的基本知识，开始认识了工人群众，开始认识了生活。不怕少，就怕一点没有，既然这是第一步，就会走第二步的，走向长期锻炼的那条越走越宽的自我改造的道路。
    一个工人阶级的作家，必需首先经过共产党员式的思想锻炼。一个共产党员，学习了马列主义之后，必需首先通过实践。这已经是创作道路中合乎“文艺座谈会讲话”中所要求的尽人皆知的基本常识了。
      “百花齐放”是党根据客观现实提出来的，因为今天的丰富多彩的生活，本身就是有色有香的大花园。
    新社会中人与人的新的关系，新的工作方法，已为作家们提供了极其方便的条件。例如：我们在工作中常常开会，当我们不能一一探索每个人的历史、工作时，在任何一个工作会议上，都可以截取一个断面，育林人员可以根据年轮来研究树木的生长，一个有经验的作家也可以在会议中来研究人、人和人的关系的。又如，我们常常把一项工作，分做布置、试点、推广等步骤，这又是给作家们了解和研究典型环境有利的条件，其总结也是作家们归纳各种现象时所需要的。我们不要忘了在我们生活中占有重要位置的鉴定会，它按照新社会的道德品质对人进行分析和鉴定，一位作家观察和研究人时，这里又提供了多少人物描写素材。我们更不应该忘记在社会主义社会建设中，不断涌现的劳动模范和先进工作者，他们的事迹是我们塑造英雄人物的永不枯竭的源泉。只要我们肯做一个工人阶级的作家，决心投身于现实生活，生活的洪流所要湮没的是那些有沉重包袱的人，而决不是想要戴上工人阶级作家这个光荣称号的人。
    生活是我们的学校。认真下工夫和作假是决不相容的。要不就做一个有出息的作家，要不就永远只会提出“厂长同志，你有什么感觉”这类愚蠢的问话。即使你装做有修养的样子，小心地没有这样问，当你和那个钻过平炉的厂长同志并肩走出车间，厂长身上那件出了汗的衣服冷冰冰地使他发抖时，你也许会说：“不，厂长同志，你莫不是病了？”你看，这又是一个使人发笑的同样愚蠢的问话。
