Correctly Treat Grain Conservation
Prevent Decline in Pig Production
Xiangtan Special District Counties Adopt Positive Measures

Changsha Dispatch from our Newspaper: Xiangtan Special District in Hunan Province is actively taking measures to correct one-sided propaganda regarding grain conservation to ensure the continued development of pig production.

This year, pig production in Xiangtan Special District has developed rapidly. The twelve counties in the special district currently have 2.4 million pigs. However, since the launch of socialist ideological education, abnormal phenomena such as indiscriminate castration of sows, selling piglets at low prices, and premature selling of fattened pigs have occurred in some townships and cooperatives. The reasons for this phenomenon are: Firstly, some localities' propaganda on grain conservation during the great debate was one-sided, and a few agricultural cooperatives made some erroneous regulations restricting pig production under the pretext of saving grain. On the other hand, some localities, after announcing that the state would not retain feed grain this year and would not supply feed grain for purchased fattened pigs, failed to promptly allocate more private plots to members who raised more pigs, causing some farmers to have some misconceptions. The resistance of some wealthy farmers to the grain unified purchase work is also reflected in the pig raising issue. Some speculators have also seized the opportunity to engage in activities, while bad elements have taken the opportunity to spread rumors and sabotage.

The CPC Hunan Provincial Committee and Xiangtan District recently instructed all counties to quickly correct this abnormal phenomenon. All counties have conducted comprehensive inspections, educating township and cooperative cadres to correct one-sided propaganda on grain conservation and abolish various unreasonable and unfavorable regulations against pig development. After conducting comprehensive inspections, Xiangtan, Wangcheng, Changsha, and other counties continued to educate farmers extensively on developing pig production, while also allocating more private plots to members. All counties have stipulated that as long as farmers can manage their grain well, adhere to the monthly grain consumption plan, and not affect their rations, they should not excessively interfere with farmers' grain consumption and should not arbitrarily label them as "wasteful households" or "capitalists" (but farmers should be educated not to use staple food to brew wine, boil sugar, or trade on the free market). In order to overcome the current feed shortage, all counties have stipulated that the feed grain retained according to the "three fix" standards this year will still be allocated to each household, and the existing feed grain in each cooperative will continue to be supplied to pig-raising households. In addition, relevant departments in all counties have also vigorously sought ways to open up sales channels for piglets and have appropriately controlled the castration of boars and sows. The downward trend in pig production in this special district has now been basically reversed, and some areas are even showing an upward trend.

    正确对待粮食节约
    防止生猪生产下降
    湘潭专区各县采取了积极措施
    本报长沙讯  湖南省湘潭专区各县正在积极采取措施，纠正在粮食节约方面的片面宣传，保证生猪生产的继续发展。
    今年湘潭专区生猪发展很快，全专区十二个县现有存栏猪已达二百四十万头，但从开展社会主义思想教育以来，部分乡、社相继发生了滥阉母猪、贱卖小猪、提前交售肉猪等反常现象。产生这一现象的原因：主要是有的地方在大辩论中对节约粮食的宣传有片面性，少数农业社以节约用粮为理由，作出了一些限制生猪生产的错误规定。另一方面，部分地方在宣布今年国家不留饲料，派购肥猪不供应饲料粮以后，又没有及时给养猪较多的社员增拨自留地，使农民产生一些错觉。一部分富裕农民对粮食统购工作的抗拒，也反映到养猪问题上来，某些地方还有投机分子乘机活动，坏分子则乘机造谣破坏。
    中共湖南省委和湘潭地区在最近指示各县迅速纠正这一反常现象。各县都进行了全面检查，教育乡、社干部纠正粮食节约方面的片面宣传，取消各种不合理的不利于生猪发展的错误规定。湘潭、望城、长沙等县在全面检查以后，继续对农民进行大力发展生猪生产的教育，同时增拨自留地给社员。各县已经规定：只要农民自己安排得好，能坚持分月计划用粮，不影响口粮，就不要过多地干涉农民的用粮，不要随便扣“浪费户”或“资本主义”的帽子（但要教育农民不用主粮煮酒、熬糖、不上自由市场进行交易）。为了克服当前的饲料困难，各县规定今年按“三定”标准留下的饲料仍旧拨给各户，各社现存的饲料也继续供应养猪户。另外，各县有关部门还大力设法开辟子猪销路，对公母猪阉割进行了适当的控制。现在这个专区生猪生产下降的趋势已经基本扭转，部分地区还有上升。
