Xinhua News Agency, November 26th. The "Soviet Film Week," jointly sponsored by the Ministry of Culture and the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association in twenty-nine cities including Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Chongqing, and the capitals of various provinces and autonomous regions such as Wuhan and Hohhot, which began in early November, has recently concluded in succession. According to statistics from only twenty-five of these cities, there were 12,180 screenings with a total audience of 8,898,030. In addition, many medium-sized cities also held "Soviet Film Weeks," with nineteen cities including Anshan, Xiamen, and Guilin participating, according to statistics from only Liaoning, Fujian, and Guangxi provinces. During this period, cinemas in many counties in Northeast China and clubs in factories and mines also screened Soviet films intensively. Liaoning Province also sent 200 film teams to screen Soviet films in mountainous rural areas. In the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, Soviet films translated into minority languages were also shown. In Urumqi, four Uzbek-translated films, including a specially selected "Pedagogical Poem," were warmly welcomed by the local ethnic minorities during the film week.

The film week was unprecedentedly grand. Many cities set unprecedented records for film attendance. In Hohhot, each cinema participating in the "Soviet Film Week" screened an average of six shows per day, and every show was fully booked. In Chongqing, 520,000 tickets were pre-sold just as the film week began, while the ten cinemas participating in the film week could only accommodate 350,000 people within the scheduled time. In Guiyang, all tickets for the entire film week were pre-sold three days before the film week began. In Lanzhou, pre-purchase registration for the 17th was completed in early November. China Film Distribution Companies in Beijing and many other cities received a large number of letters from the audience requesting an extension of the film week and an increase in the number of screenings.

The films screened during the film week were generally well-received by the audience, and many newspapers and magazines in various places published articles reviewing these excellent films. A viewer in Shanghai wrote an article entitled "Good Teacher and Helpful Friend" to praise the socialist educational significance of these films. The Communist Youth League branches of some schools, factories, and institutions in Chongqing, Harbin, Hangzhou, Hefei, and other places also organized young people to discuss the film "How the Steel Was Tempered," to learn from Paul's spirit of dedication to the socialist revolution and his firm proletarian stance. Some young people in Jinan and Changsha, who were greedy for comfort and unwilling to leave the city, after watching "How the Steel Was Tempered," signed up to go to the countryside for training and to go to the places where the motherland needs them most, to live like Paul.

    新华社26日讯　文化部和中苏友好协会总会在北京、上海、天津、重庆和各省、自治区首府武汉、呼和浩特等二十九个城市，自11月初旬起联合主办的“苏联电影周”，最近陆续结束，仅据其中二十五个城市的统计，就放映了一万二千一百八十场，观众达八百八十九万八千零三十人次。此外，许多中等城市也举办了“苏联电影周”，仅据辽宁、福建、广西三个省的统计就有鞍山、厦门、桂林等十九个城市参加。东北许多县的电影院和工厂、矿山的俱乐部也在此期间集中演出了苏联影片。辽宁省并且派出了二百个电影队携带苏联影片到山区农村中放映。在内蒙古自治区和新疆维吾尔自治区并放映了以少数民族语文译制的苏联影片。乌鲁木齐市在电影周期间特选的“教育的诗篇”等四部乌孜别克文译制片，受到当地少数民族人民的热烈欢迎。
    这次电影周盛况空前。许多城市创造了影片上座的空前纪录。呼和浩特市参加“苏联电影周”的每个影院，平均每天放映六场，场场满座。重庆市在电影周刚刚开始，就预售出去了五十二万张票，而参加电影周的十家影院在预定的时间内，只能容纳三十五万人次。贵阳市在电影周开始前三天，就预售完了整个电影周期间的票。兰州市在11月初就把17日的票预购登记出去了。北京等许多城市的中国影片发行公司接到大量观众的来信，要求电影周延期结束和增加影片的放映场数。
    电影周期间放映的影片，普遍得到观众的好评，各地许多报纸、杂志刊载了评介这些优秀影片的文章。上海市的一位观众，以“良师益友”为题著文盛赞这些影片的社会主义教育意义。重庆、哈尔滨、杭州、合肥等地的若干学校、工厂、机关的共青团支部并且组织青年来讨论“保尔·柯察金”这部影片，学习保尔为社会主义革命事业献身的精神和他的坚定的无产阶级立场。济南、长沙有一些机关青年因为贪图安逸，不愿意离开城市，在看过“保尔·柯察金”后，纷纷报名要求到农村中去锻炼，到祖国最需要的地方去，像保尔那样去生活。
