Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 18th. Since the replica of the first Soviet artificial satellite began to be exhibited in the Science Pavilion of the Soviet Industrial Exhibition, it has attracted a large number of visitors, with thousands of people visiting it every day. Although the exhibition closed on the 15th, there are still many visitors hoping to see it.

The people who visit the artificial satellite first see the model of the artificial satellite revolving around the Earth. As soon as they enter the door, they are attracted by the "beep, beep, beep" signals sent by the artificial satellite from "space." People see the "Earth" slowly rotating in the deep blue sky, with "sun" light shining on the "Earth" from one side. Countless stars twinkle in the sky. Around this Earth, a small artificial satellite revolves around it, leaving a bright trace that gradually disappears after the satellite moves away. We can see that in the time it takes for the Earth to rotate once, this small metal ball revolves around the Earth fifteen times.

The replica of the artificial satellite is exactly the same as the first artificial satellite currently orbiting the Earth. It is a backup of the first artificial satellite. It is fixed on a metal rod in the center of the exhibition hall. The satellite's four hollow antenna poles are 2.4 to 2.9 meters long and as thick as fingers, and they hang down from the satellite body to the audience. The outer shell of the artificial satellite is made of aluminum alloy, so it looks shiny. Its color is like a newly bought aluminum pot, but it is much brighter than an aluminum pot. An average person can probably hug this sphere, which is 58 centimeters in diameter, just right with both hands. Its exterior looks very smooth, with no seams except for a round hole about three or four inches in diameter. From that round hole, people can also vaguely see the complex mechanisms inside the sphere.

The exhibition hall also displays many charts introducing the Soviet Union's first two artificial satellites and their operation, as well as the scientific significance of artificial satellites. In addition, there are also photographs of articles from newspapers and scientists from various countries praising the successful launch of the artificial satellite and a large number of congratulatory telegrams on display.

    人造卫星如何运行
    莫斯科展览第一个卫星复制品围绕地球旋转的模型活动如真
    新华社莫斯科18日电　苏联第一个人造卫星的复制品开始在苏联工业展览会科学馆展出以来，吸引了大批观众，每天都有成千的人前往参观。展览会虽然已经在15日闭幕，但是，还有大批观众希望前往参观。
    参观这个人造卫星的人们首先看到的是人造卫星围绕地球旋转的模型。一进门，他们就被人造卫星从“宇宙”中发来的“噼、噼、噼”的讯号声吸引住了。人们看见“地球”在深蓝色的天空中缓缓地旋转，“太阳”光从一边向“地球”射来。天空中无数的星星一明一灭地在眨眼。在这个地球周围，一个小小的人造卫星在围绕着它旋转，留下一条明亮的痕迹，在卫星远去后才逐渐地消逝。我们可以看到，在地球自转一圈的时间内，这个金属小球就围绕地球转了十五圈。
    人造卫星的复制品和目前正绕着地球旋转的第一个人造卫星完全一样。它是第一个人造卫星的后备。它被固定在陈列馆正中央的一根金属棒上。卫星的四根空心天线杆长达二·四到二·九公尺，有手指般粗细，它们从卫星体一直下垂到观众的面前。人造卫星的外壳是用铝合金制成的，因此看上去闪闪发光。它的颜色好像新买的铝锅一样，可是要比铝锅亮得多。这个直径达五十八公分的圆球，如果一个普通人用两手合抱，大概恰恰可以抱住。它的外表看上去非常光滑，四周除了一个直径约三、四吋的圆洞外，没有一条接缝。从那圆洞里，人们还可以隐约地看到球体内部复杂的机件。
    陈列馆内还陈列着许多图表，介绍了苏联头两个人造卫星及其运行的情况和人造卫星的科学意义。此外，这里还展出了各国报刊和科学家赞扬人造卫星发射成功的文章的照片和大量贺电。（附图片）
