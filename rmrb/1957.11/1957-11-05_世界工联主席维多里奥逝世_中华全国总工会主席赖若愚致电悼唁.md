Vittorio's Biography

Vittorio was born in Sirinola, Italy, in September 1892. He never attended school, but studied hard from a young age and became involved in revolutionary activities in his youth. In 1921, he was elected as a member of the Italian Parliament. By this time, he had already participated in the leadership of the Italian Communist Party.

Vittorio was engaged in mass movements for a long time. He served as the secretary of the Italian Farmers' Union from 1924 to 1926. During Mussolini's rule, he actively engaged in anti-fascist activities. In 1927, he was arrested by the fascist government and sentenced to twelve years in prison. Later, he escaped to France, where he led a secret Italian trade union organization. During the Spanish Civil War, he and many Italian communists joined the International Brigades. From 1936 to 1937, he served as the political commissar of the First International Brigade. After the defeat of the Spanish Republican government, he fled to France and continued to engage in anti-fascist work, becoming the head of the "Italian Voice" newspaper. In 1941, he was arrested again by Nazi Germany in Paris and sent to Italy. After the fall of the Mussolini government in 1943, Vittorio was released from prison and continued to actively engage in political activities and mass movements, serving as a member of the post-war Constituent Assembly. In January 1945, the Italian General Confederation of Labor was established, and he served as its General Secretary.

From 1949, Vittorio also served as the Chairman of the Executive Bureau of the World Federation of Trade Unions. Before his death, he was also a member of the leading body of the Italian Communist Party.
