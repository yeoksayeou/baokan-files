Xinhua News Agency, 8th. Soviet Ambassador to China, Yudin, recorded a radio address for Chinese listeners on the 7th, broadcast by the Central People's Broadcasting Station, to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution. The full text of the speech is as follows:

    Respected listeners of the People's Republic of China! Dear Comrades and friends!

    In these momentous days celebrating the 40th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution, please allow me, taking this opportunity afforded by the Central People's Broadcasting Station, to extend my warmest congratulations to you, and to convey the brotherly and friendly feelings of the Soviet people to the great Chinese people.

    Forty years ago, under the leadership of the Communist Party and its leader – the great Lenin, the working masses of Russia overthrew the regime of capitalists and landlords on one-sixth of the earth's land, established the world's first worker and peasant state, and confidently embarked on the road of building a new socialist society.

    In the struggle against the numerous enemies who launched wars against the young worker-peasant regime, the Soviet people overcame numerous difficulties and achieved historically significant victories in the years following the Great October Revolution. For the first time in the world, they eliminated the exploitation of man by man and established a socialist society in our country. Our motherland transformed from a backward agricultural country into a great industrial power. In the countryside, the collective farm system triumphed, paving the way for millions of peasants to a new and happy life. A genuine cultural revolution took place throughout the country, making the Soviet Union a highly developed country in science and culture. All of this could only become a reality after the Great October Socialist Revolution.

    Our socialist system underwent a severe test during the Great Patriotic War against the fascist aggressors. In this war, the Soviet Union not only defended its own freedom and independence but also helped other nations to break free from fascist enslavement.

    In the postwar years, the Soviet people, through their heroic and tenacious labor, once again practically demonstrated the great superiority of the socialist system. Now, the Soviet Union is victoriously advancing towards communism.

    Our country's total industrial output in 1957 exceeded the level of 1913 by thirty-two times, and in the most important industrial sectors such as machinery manufacturing and metal processing, the output has increased two hundredfold during the same period.

    In the era of Soviet power, the entire face of our country has undergone fundamental changes. Since the October Revolution, more than nine hundred new cities have appeared on the map of our motherland.

    It is by no means accidental that the world's first and second artificial earth satellites currently orbiting the Earth were launched from the Soviet Union.

    This historic achievement, marking a new era in science, was only possible based on the tremendous achievements of Soviet industry, culture, and science. And these achievements are precisely the direct result of the great social changes that have taken place in our country after the October Revolution.

    Since the Great October Socialist Revolution, the world situation has fundamentally changed in favor of socialism. Socialism has now become a world system. The Soviet people are pleased and proud that the people of many countries in Europe and Asia are now advancing hand in hand with the Soviet people along the road of socialist development. The historic victory of the Chinese revolution is of particularly great significance, it is the most outstanding event in world history since the Great October Revolution. After embarking on the road of socialist development, the great Chinese people, under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, have achieved great accomplishments in all aspects of politics, economy, and culture in the eight years since the founding of the People's Republic of China. The Soviet people are very pleased to see the successful realization of the socialist transformation of Chinese agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce, which has changed the nature of China's relations of production and ensured the establishment of socialism. The Soviet people are very happy to celebrate the successful completion of China's first Five-Year Plan and the rapid development of Chinese industry. Now, Chinese industry is able to produce automobiles, jet aircraft, various new types of equipment and machine tools, and many other machines.

    Dear Chinese friends!

    Please allow me, in the name of the Soviet people, to wish the great Chinese people further achievements in the cause of building socialism.

    From the very beginning, the banner of the Great October Socialist Revolution was inscribed with the words "Peace to All Peoples." The foreign policy of the Soviet state has always been an active, Leninist policy of striving for peace. In our time, the socialist camp is a powerful fortress of peace throughout the world.

    The unbreakable friendship between the Soviet and Chinese people is a great force in the struggle for peace. This friendship is based on complete unity of thought, interests, and goals; our common goal is to build a communist society.

    In celebrating the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution, we are pleased to see that the fraternal friendship and solidarity between the people of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China is steadily developing and strengthening.

    Long live the 40th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution!

    Long live the eternal and unbreakable friendship and cooperation between the Soviet and Chinese people – a powerful bastion of world peace!

    尤金向中国听众发表广播讲话
    新华社8日讯　中央人民广播电台7日广播了苏联驻中国特命全权大使尤金为庆祝十月革命四十周年向中国听众发表的广播讲话录音。讲话全文如下：尊敬的中华人民共和国听众们！亲爱的同志和朋友们！
    在庆祝伟大十月社会主义革命四十周年的这些意义重大的日子里，请允许我趁中央人民广播电台邀我讲话的机会，向你们致以热烈的祝贺，并向伟大的中国人民转达苏联人民兄弟般友好的感情。
    四十年以前，俄国劳动群众在共产党和党的领袖——伟大的列宁的领导下，在地球的六分之一土地上推翻了资本家和地主的政权，建立了世界上第一个工人和农民的国家，并且满怀信心地走上了建立社会主义新社会的道路。
    在跟掀起战争反对年轻工农政权的许许多多敌人进行的斗争中，苏联人民克服了重重的困难，在伟大十月革命以后的几年中取得了具有历史意义的胜利，第一次在世界上消灭了人对人的剥削，并在我们国家里建立了社会主义社会。我们的祖国从一个落后的农业国变成了一个伟大的工业强国。在农村里，集体农庄制度获得了胜利，它为千百万农民群众走向幸福的新生活开辟了道路。全国发生了真正的文化革命，它使苏联成为一个科学和文化高度发展的国。家所有这一切只有在伟大的十月社会主义革命以后才有可能变为现实。
    我国的社会主义制度，在抵抗法西斯侵略者的伟大卫国战争期间经受了严重的考验。苏联在这次战争中，不仅保卫住了自己的自由和独立，而且帮助别国人民摆脱了法西斯的奴役。
    在战后的年代里，苏联人民用他们英勇的顽强的劳动，又一次在实际上证明了社会主义制度的巨大优越性。现在，苏联正在胜利地向着共产主义前进。
    我国1957年的工业产品总额超过了1913年水平的三十二倍，而在像机器制造业和金属加工业这样一些最重要的工业部门，产品的出产量在这同一时期内已经增加到二百倍。
    在苏维埃政权的年代里，我们国家的整个面貌起了根本的变化。十月革命以后，我们祖国的地图上出现了九百多座新城市。
    目前正在围绕地球运转的世界上第一颗和第二颗人造地球卫星所以恰恰会从苏联发出，这决不是偶然的。
    这项标志着科学中一个新时代的历史性成就，只有在苏联工业、文化和科学的巨大成就的基础上才有可能获得。而这些成就正就是十月革命后我国所发生的伟大社会变革的直接结果。
    从伟大十月社会主义革命以来，世界局势已经从根本上变得有利于社会主义了。现在社会主义已经成为一个世界性的体系。苏联人感到高兴和骄傲的是，目前和苏联人民手牵着手一道沿着社会主义发展道路前进的有欧洲和亚洲许多国家的人民。中国革命的历史性胜利具有特别重大的意义，它是伟大十月革命以后世界历史中最杰出的事件。在走上社会主义发展道路以后，伟大的中国人民在共产党和毛泽东主席的领导下，在中华人民共和国成立以后的八年中，在政治、经济和文化各个方面获得了巨大的成就。苏联人民非常高兴地看到了中国农业、手工业、资本主义工商业社会主义改造的顺利实现，它们改变了中国生产关系的性质，保证了社会主义的建立。苏联人民非常高兴地庆祝了中国第一个五年计划的胜利完成和中国工业的迅速发展。现在，中国工业界已经能够生产汽车、喷气式飞机、各种新式装备和机床，以及许许多多别的机器。
    亲爱的中国朋友们！
    请允许我以苏联人民的名义祝伟大的中国人民在建设社会主义的事业中获得进一步的成就。
    在伟大十月革命的旗帜上从一开始就书写着“和平归于各族人民”的字样。苏维埃国家的外交政策从一开始就是积极争取和平的列宁主义政策。在我们当代，社会主义阵营是全世界的强大的和平堡垒。
    苏中两国人民之间的牢不可破的友谊是和平斗争中的伟大力量。这种友谊建立在思想、利益和目标完全一致的基础上，我们的共同目标就是建立共产主义社会。
    在庆祝十月革命四十周年的日子里，我们高兴地看到，苏联和中华人民共和国两国人民之间的兄弟般的友谊和团结正在一往直前地进一步发展和巩固起来。
    伟大的十月社会主义革命四十周年万岁！
    苏联人民和中国人民之间的永恒的牢不可破的友谊和合作——世界和平的强大堡垒万岁！
