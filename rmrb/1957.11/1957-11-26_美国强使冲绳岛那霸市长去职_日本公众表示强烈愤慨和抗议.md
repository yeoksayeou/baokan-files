Xinhua News Agency, November 25th: The U.S. occupying authorities on Okinawa Island, employing brutal and illegal means, today forced the Naha City Council, the capital of Okinawa Island, to pass a vote of no confidence against Naha City Mayor Kamejiro Senaga, finally ousting this mayor who represents the interests of the people of Okinawa Island.

    To realize this long-planned conspiracy, the U.S. Civil Administration, which rules the entire Ryukyu Islands, specially issued a statement yesterday, slandering Senaga as "not representing public opinion" and "hindering autonomy." Furthermore, in order to drive Senaga away, it announced amendments to the Ryukyu Islands' Local Autonomy Law and Election Law, namely: as long as more than one-half of the councilors in the Naha City Council vote in favor, a vote of no confidence in the mayor can be passed. The original law stipulated that a vote of no confidence in the mayor must be supported by more than two-thirds of the councilors to be valid. This morning, the Naha City Council, based on this new regulation of the U.S. authorities, passed the vote of no confidence in Senaga by a vote of seventeen to ten.

    In order to further control the affairs of Okinawa Island and completely realize its conspiracy to drive Senaga out of the political arena, the U.S. Civil Administration also announced the following illegal decisions yesterday: If disputes occur between the mayor and the council that cannot be resolved through mediation, the decision will be made by the Chief Executive. The current Chief Executive is a pro-American Democrat. It was also announced that so-called "guilty persons" cannot hold public office. According to Kyodo News, Senaga was declared to have "committed a crime" because he had protected members of the progressive People's Party in 1954.

    Kamejiro Senaga said in a statement today that he will continue to fight for Japan's independence and world peace.

    Senaga said that although U.S. Civil Administrator for the Ryukyus, Moore, has achieved his goal this time, he will be accused of being a "military dictator" not only by the people of Okinawa Island, but also by the Japanese people.

    Tokyo dispatch: Japanese political parties and social organizations today strongly protested the illegal act of the U.S. Civil Administration of the Ryukyus in forcing Kamejiro Senaga, the mayor of Naha City, the capital of Okinawa Island, to step down. The Socialist Party sent a telegram to Moore, the High Commissioner of the U.S. Civil Administration of the Ryukyus, today, demanding the immediate revocation of the order to amend the Ryukyu Autonomy Law and Election Law.

    The Socialist Party also demanded that the Japanese government lodge a serious protest with the United States.

    Okuma Tokuichi, Vice Chairman of the Tokyo Okinawa Prefectural Association, said regarding the U.S. ousting of Mayor Senaga that the U.S.'s arbitrary removal of a person elected through democratic means is an act of destroying democracy and depriving the people of Okinawa Island of their freedom.

    The Tokyo University Student Association sent eight representatives to the U.S. Embassy in Japan today to protest.

    The Tokyo Metropolitan Student Association Federation also sent representatives to the U.S. Embassy to protest.

    The All-Japan Student Self-Government Association Federation decided to hold a protest demonstration in front of the U.S. Embassy tomorrow afternoon.

    美国强使冲绳岛那霸市长去职  日本公众表示强烈愤慨和抗议
    本报综合报道　据新华社25日讯：冲绳岛的美国占领当局采用横暴的非法手段，今天强使冲绳岛首府那霸市的议会通过对那霸市市长濑长龟次郎的不信任案，终于把这位代表冲绳岛人民利益的市长赶下了台。
    为了实现这一蓄谋已久的阴谋，统治整个琉球群岛的美国民政府昨天特地发表声明，诽谤濑长“不代表民意”和“妨碍自治”，并且为了赶走濑长而宣布了修改琉球群岛的地方自治法和选举法，即：那霸市议会里只要有二分之一以上的议员投票赞成，就可以通过对市长的不信任案。而原来的法律规定，对市长的不信任案必须得到三分之二以上议员的赞成才能成立。今天上午，那霸市议会就是根据美国当局的这项新规定，以十七票对十票通过了对濑长的不信任案。
    美国民政府为了进一步控制冲绳岛的事务和彻底实现它把濑长赶出政治舞台的阴谋，在昨天还宣布了这样的非法决定：如果市长和议会发生争端而不能用调解办法解决时，就由行政主席决定。而现任行政主席是亲美的民主党人；同时还宣布所谓“有罪的人”不能担任公职。据共同社说，濑长因为在1954年曾经保护进步政党人民党的党员而被宣布“犯过罪”。
    濑长龟次郎今天发表谈话说，他将继续坚持为争取日本的独立和世界和平而斗争。
    濑长说，美国琉球民政府高级专员穆尔虽然这一次达到了他的目的，但是他不仅会被冲绳岛人民，而且会被日本人民指责为“军人独裁者”。
    东京消息：日本的政党和社会团体今天强烈抗议美国琉球民政府强迫冲绳岛首府那霸市市长濑长龟次郎下台的非法行为。社会党在今天打电报给美国琉球民政府高级专员穆尔，要求立即撤销关于修改琉球自治法和选举法的命令。
    社会党还要求日本政府向美国提出严重的抗议。
    东京冲绳县人会副会长奥间德一就美国赶走濑长市长这件事发表谈话说，美国随意把通过民主方式选举出来的人赶走是破坏民主、剥夺冲绳岛人民自由的行为。
    东京大学学生自治会今天派代表八人到美国驻日本大使馆提出了抗议。
    东京都学生自治会联合会也派代表向美国大使馆提出了抗议。
    全日本学生自治会总联合会决定明天下午在美国大使馆前面举行抗议示威。
