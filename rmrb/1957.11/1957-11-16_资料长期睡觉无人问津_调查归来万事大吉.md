    Data Sleeps Long-Term, Ignored
    Investigation Returns, All's Well

    Some time ago, when we were sorting out the data, we found that quite a few items were collected and organized by comrades personally going to various places since 1953. Among these data, many are valuable, but we rarely see anyone studying them.

    We also have opinions on sending people down for investigation and research. Some comrades did go down and collected a lot of materials, but after returning, they didn't conduct further research and simply submitted a summary and considered it done. This was the case when Comrade Li Lun and others went to Shanghai in 1953, and when they went to Northeast China, Shanghai, Jiangxi, Shanxi, and other places in 1955. It was also the case when Director Ma and Comrade Ye Feng and others went to East China twice last year. We need to go down, but such practices are somewhat not worth the cost. We suggest changing this situation in the future.

    资料长期睡觉无人问津
    调查归来万事大吉
    前些日子，我们整理资料时，发现为数不少是1953年以来同志们亲自到各地了解整理的。这些资料中，有很多是有价值的，但我们却很少看到有人研究过。
    对于派人下去调查研究，我们也有意见。有的同志虽说也下去了，并且搜集了不少材料，但回来后也不进一步研究，只写了个总结交上去就算完事。1953年李纶等同志去上海，1955年去东北、上海、江西、山西等地，去年马局长和叶锋同志等先后两次去华东就是这样。我们需要下去，但这样的作法未免有些得不偿失。建议今后改变这种状况。文化部艺术局　刘英华、高明辉
