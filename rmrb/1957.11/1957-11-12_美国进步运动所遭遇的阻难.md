The Obstacles Faced by the American Progressive Movement
By Shě Bèi'ěrfúléiqí, Editor of the American "National Guardian"

I do not claim to be an expert, having lived in the United States for only twenty-five years. However, I believe my comments are based on direct experience regarding certain situations I encountered during the Cold War era.

Let me begin with a brief observation on the current economic realities of the United States.

The American working class has waged many struggles against the extremely cruel exploitation characteristic of the early stages of industrialization. Today, the working class's unions are powerful. Therefore, even though profits grow much faster than wages, millions of industrial workers in the United States enjoy a relatively high material standard of living. However, a closer look reveals that the situation is not so rosy. Most Americans pay more than one-fifth or even one-quarter of their income on rent, and in recent years, with severe housing shortages, this housing is often uninhabitable. Moreover, most Americans are frequently in debt, and the total national debt is constantly increasing. Extending credit to daily necessities is one of the many ways capitalism extends its life in the face of increasing economic contradictions. Although the average American says that their car, household appliances, or house belongs to them, in reality, very few Americans truly own these things. Workers must repay a fixed proportion of their debt each month to obtain these items, and this amount often accounts for a large part of their salary. In addition to the cost of maintaining a minimum standard of living, they must also pay taxes on all their income.

Although the normal work week for industrial workers is forty hours, the demands on their work intensity are extremely strict and constantly increasing. Once a worker cannot maintain the required work intensity, they will lose their job. Illness, accidents, and old age are nightmares that Americans dare not contemplate. Although collective insurance plans can alleviate some medical burdens, a long-term illness can lead to bankruptcy. Pensions are not sufficient to survive on. Therefore, coexisting with economic prosperity is a feeling of personal and family insecurity.

To provide a more comprehensive picture of the overall economic situation, it is also worth pointing out that the income of more than half of American families is less than the government's so-called "minimum expense to maintain traditional, social, and even physiological needs." However, most families living below the minimum standard are not industrial workers' families. Most of them are farmers, the elderly, and small clerks whose incomes are lower than those of industrial workers. In 1952, one-ninth of families had incomes that were one-third less than the official minimum income (and this situation has not changed much since), which shows how meager the incomes of many families are. As for the portion of the American population between the poorest and the richest, the government admits that the sum of the income of half of them is less than the income of the richest tenth.

When discussing the progressive movement in any industrialized country, the industrial working class must be regarded as the decisive collective. American industrial workers generally continue to be in debt, suffer from insecurity, and have their freedom of speech strictly limited. However, as long as they can continue to maintain their work intensity and thus retain their wage income, their lives can be not too bad. This is the economic background that should be seen when assessing the development of the American progressive movement.

However, this economic background alone is far from sufficient to explain the difficulties faced by the American progressive movement. In the "democratic" society of the "free world" of the United States, the persecution of the progressive movement is unique in its scale, variety, and insidious nature.

After the war, the American government and press launched an unprecedentedly rampant attack on the progressive movement. Most progressive organizations had to devote almost all their energy to fighting for the right to exist. American reactionaries invented many new techniques in this offensive, and their effect on swaying public opinion is much more sophisticated than the methods of the defeated fascists.

American anti-progressive propaganda is conducted with an appearance of "objectivity," and we would be mistaken to underestimate its cleverness. A recent pictorial article on China in "Look" magazine is a good example. No one would argue that the photographs published in "Look" magazine were not taken in China. But from the tens of thousands of photographs taken by its photographers in China, some photographs were carefully selected for publication with the sole purpose of proving that China is a veritable slave state. In fact, these photos in no way represent the new China.

In essence, this is the way propagandists distort the American progressive movement. Relying on this malicious method, they convince millions of Americans that the word "American" and the word "Communist" stand at opposite poles, one meaning everything that is noble and the other everything that is terrible. Many people who do not fully believe this formula also pay lip service to it.

Political interrogations and "investigations" by congressional committees are a well-planned method of persecuting American progressive forces. Today, if someone accuses a person of being a Communist now or in the past, and that person denies it, that person risks being imprisoned for perjury. If he admits it and does not denounce others, he is guilty of "contempt of Congress." If he refuses to answer the questions of the investigating committee (which anyone has the legal right to do, and most progressives do), then he will be "exposed" on the grounds that since he does not deny it, it must be true. The most common situation is that he immediately loses his job, the union to which he belongs expels him from membership, and if he was not born in the United States, he will be deported.

These kinds of political interrogations and investigations are conducted with a legal appearance. In reality, the laws on which they are based are themselves unconstitutional. Tens of thousands of people who have been politically persecuted have pointed this out. But these statements are rarely published, so it is difficult for the public to know about these things. The monopolists of public opinion propaganda tools, waving the banner of "freedom of the press," have long been a major part of the anti-progressive movement.

This political persecution is effective because it is impossible to present counter-evidence. The Rosenbergs were sentenced to death because they did not admit the charges against them, refused to denounce "conspirators," and could not prove that they had not committed the crimes they were accused of. Of course, they were actually convicted simply because they had participated in legitimate progressive activities, and there was no evidence to prove that they were actually guilty. These interrogations and investigations are only meant to give the public the impression that all progressive activities are treasonous. Communist leaders are imprisoned for being accused of "conspiring to incite the violent overthrow of the government," although there is no evidence that they have ever used or advocated violence.

So far, the most active progressives in the United States have either been tried by the courts for "conspiracy to incite sedition" or punished by congressional committees. Although congressional committees have no power to punish legally, in fact, they can inflict devastating social or economic blows on those who do not yield. The American government spares no expense in carrying out anti-progressive movements, including the widespread use of police spies. Political police monitor everyone who has ever been an active progressive, and can arrest them within an hour or two whenever they deem it necessary.

Adopting Hitler's methods entirely to deal with progressives, or explicitly banning progressive publications, does not conform to the government's current strategy. Their strategy is to isolate and restrict the activities of the progressive movement while still being able to boast about "American democracy" to the deeply propagandized American public. The Communist Party is "legal," but if you join it, you can be arrested and imprisoned at any time on completely fabricated charges. Progressive publications can be published, but they are boycotted by book and magazine sellers, and political police use intimidation tactics to deter buyers. For example, readers of the independent "National Guardian" weekly are often visited by political police who "advise" them to stop subscribing. One of the threats is: if the boss finds out, you will lose your job. This is not just a bluff. Subscribers often have to weigh the choice between subscribing to a progressive newspaper and losing their jobs. But technically, subscribing to a magazine is perfectly legal and perfectly free. The vast majority of Americans do not even know these things happen, and if you tell them, they will say you are lying.

The appearance of freedom easily leads politically immature people to the false conclusion that the progressive movement has made no contribution to the United States, because if it had, the movement would not be so weak. Official propaganda constantly portrays the progressive movement as foreign and hateful. Many decent but misguided Americans believe this propaganda.

In the American progressive movement, the issue of social and economic equality for blacks remains important. Since the Supreme Court issued the decree abolishing the segregation of black and white children in schools, this issue has gained more support than ever before. Today, with the support of a broad mass of white people, blacks are waging the most resolute and effective struggle to abolish all forms of racial discrimination and deny blacks the right to vote.

Black industrial workers are subjected to heavy exploitation. On the whole, their incomes are much lower than those of their white counterparts. Their lives are particularly insecure, often "last hired and first fired," and they are strictly limited in promotion opportunities. They are often unable to participate equally in unions with white workers. They risk greater danger to participate in progressive groups.

Today, other ethnic minorities who are subjected to equal or even more brutal exploitation, but are not well known abroad, are the Mexicans in the southwest and the Puerto Ricans who mainly live in New York City. Puerto Rico is a West Indian island that the United States seized from Spain half a century ago. In recent times, it has been given more autonomy in form than in reality. About 500,000 Puerto Ricans have moved to the United States and are undergoing brutal exploitation.

In the United States, small farmers and the elderly are classes who are aware of their own exploitation and are more receptive to progressive ideas. The United States has never established a tradition like that in China, Africa, and elsewhere: caring for the elderly is the obligation of the family. The elderly often live in a state of semi-starvation. They are an organized fighting force across the United States, especially in the Northwest. Small farmers are the traditional symbol of the "strict individualists" that the United States likes to boast about. But now, they are being blackmailed by those brokers who stand between them and the market. In addition, large-scale mechanized farms that operate like large urban enterprises and that they cannot compete with are also attacking them. Under this double attack, they are being squeezed out. Experience has made many small farmers see through the deceptive propaganda that keeps many urban residents from seeing the incurable diseases of capitalism behind the façade of prosperity.

American progressives have realized that in the past decade, there has been a considerable increase in the tendency of Americans to be indifferent to world affairs. After the Cold War, which touted the "American spirit," and the reactionaries gained power, fear suffocated the voices of protest. However, when the Soviet agricultural delegation visited the United States two years ago, the traditional neighborly spirit among the American people was revealed again. The delegation was warmly and sincerely welcomed by residents of conservative agricultural states.

If a Chinese delegation visits the United States on a reciprocal basis, there is no reason to believe that they will not receive a similar welcome. The attitude of the American government toward China in no way reflects the attitude of broad sections of the people, or even the attitude of a considerable number of business people. These people are eager to take action because they see other countries conducting profitable trade with China. It is no longer possible to convince the average American that the Chinese people committed an act of "aggression" by defending their borders in the Korean War. Americans know – even if they don't say it – that their country would have taken the same measures and actions in the same situation. They have never shown any enthusiasm for the Korean War. Many Americans think Chiang Kai-shek is a rogue, and others think he is stupid. In a recent issue of "Life" magazine, Chiang Kai-shek obsequiously pleaded for the United States to launch a crusade against China. He insisted that the United States must organize and lead this movement, and leave the dirty work to Asians. Americans will not be deceived by this absurd rhetoric. They know that they will be drawn into war as a result, and that such a war will only bring them harm and no benefit.

Experience is the greatest teacher. When it comes to waging war against the People's Republic of China or other socialist countries, the memory of Korea is still fresh. As for the domestic situation, capitalist prosperity supported by a huge war industry is built on sand. The day will come when the American people generally understand this from experience, and the reality of life will raise the awareness of the American people. The American progressive movement, which is still not large enough in terms of numbers or influence, is more full of firm confidence than ever before. It realizes that when the unstable foundations of prosperity are exposed among the masses, the burden will fall on its shoulders.

    美国进步运动所遭遇的阻难
    美国“国民前卫”报编辑  奢·贝尔弗雷奇
    我并不以专家自居，因为在美国只住了二十五年。不过对于在冷战年代里我直接体验过的某些情况说来，我的谈论还是有根据的。
    让我先对美国目前的经济现实情况作一扼要的观察。
    美国工人阶级曾进行了很多斗争，反对工业化初期特有的极端残酷的剥削方式。今天，工人阶级的工会是有力量的。因此，在美国即使利润的增长速度远比工资快，千百万产业工人还是有着较高的物质生活水平。不过，如果更深入地观察，就会看出情况并非如此美妙。大多数美国人要将五分之一甚至四分之一以上的收入缴付房租，而在房荒十分严重的近几年中，这些房子往往是不适宜居住的。此外，大多数美国人经常负债，全国人民的债务总数不断增加。将信贷扩大到日用品方面，这是资本主义在经济矛盾不断增加时，延长自己生命的许多方法之一。尽管一般美国人将汽车、家庭用具或者房屋说成是属于他们自己的，实际上，只有极少数的美国人，是这些东西的真正主人。工人们为了得到这些物品，他们每月必须按一定比例还债，而这笔款的数量往往占了薪金的很大部分。除了维持最低生活的费用以外，他们在一切收入上还必须纳税。
    虽然产业工人正常的工作周是四十小时，但是对他们的工作强度的要求极其严格，并且在不断提高。一个工人一旦不能保持所要求的工作强度，他就会失掉职业。疾病、意外事故和老年，都是美国人不敢去想的梦魇。虽然集体保险计划能够减轻医疗上一些负担，但是一次长期的疾病就会导致破产。养老金并不足以维持生存。因此，和经济繁荣同时并存的，是个人和家庭不安全的感觉。
    为了将经济总面貌介绍得更为全面，还可以指出一件事，即大约半数以上的美国家庭的收入，比起政府的所谓“维持传统的、社会的以至生理需要的最低限度的费用”还要少。不过，生活在最低标准以下的大多数家庭，并不是产业工人的家庭。他们大部分是收入较产业工人为少的农民、老年人和小职员。在1952年，有九分之一的家庭收入比官方的最低收入还要少三分之一（这种情况到现在并没有多大改变），这个事实表明许多家庭收入多么微薄。至于美国国内介于最穷的和最富的中间的那一部分人，政府承认，他们中一半人的收入总和比最富的十分之一的人的收入还要少。
    在探讨任何工业发达国家进步运动的问题时，必须将产业工人视为决定性的集体。美国产业工人一般都继续负债，为不安定所苦恼，同时言论的自由受到严格的限制。不过只要他们能够继续维持工作强度，从而保有他们的工资收入，他们的生活可以过得不太坏。这是在估计美国进步运动的发展状况时应当看到的经济背景。
    但是，单是这个经济背景远不足以说明美国进步运动所遭遇的困难。在美国这个“自由世界”的“民主”社会中，对进步运动的迫害，其规模之大，花样之多，性质之阴险，是独特的。
    战后，美国政府与报刊对进步运动发动了空前猖狂的进攻。大多数进步组织，几乎都必须用全副精力为生存权利而斗争。美国反动派在这场进攻中发明了许多新技巧，它们在左右广大舆论的效果上，要比失败的法西斯分子的方法高明得多。
    美国的反进步的宣传是以“客观”的外貌进行的，如果我们过低估计它的巧妙就会上当。“展望”杂志最近发表关于中国的图解文章，就是一个很好的例子。没有人会去争辩“展望”杂志发表的照片是不是在中国拍摄的。但是从它的摄影记者在中国拍摄的上万张照片中，仔细挑选出一些照片来发表，其目的只是要证明中国是一个道地的奴隶国家。事实上这些照片丝毫不能代表新中国。
    实质上，这就是宣传家们歪曲美国进步运动的手法。他们依靠这种恶毒的方法，使千百万美国人相信，“美国人”这个字和“共产党员”这个字是站在对立的两极，一个意味一切都是高贵的，而另一个全是糟糕的。许多不完全相信的人也在口头上奉承这条公式。
    政治审讯和国会委员会的“调查”，是对美国进步力量的一种布置周密的迫害方法。今天，如果有人告发一个人，指他现在或者过去是一个共产党员，而这个人加以否认，这个人就冒有犯伪誓罪而被监禁的危险。如果他承认了而没有检举别人，就犯了“藐视国会”的罪名。如果不回答调查委员会的问题（任何人都有这种合法权利，并且大部分进步分子也是这样做的），那就会以既然不加否认就必定是事实为理由而被“揭发”。最通常的情况就是他马上失掉职业，他所属的工会将开除他的会籍，如果他不在美国诞生，就将被驱逐出境。
    这类政治审讯和调查是以合法的外表进行的。实际上，他们所依据的法律本身就不合宪法。成千上万受到政治迫害的人都曾指出这一点。但是这种声明很少被发表，因此公众很难知道这些事情。舆论宣传工具的垄断者，摇着“新闻自由”的旗子，长期以来就是反进步运动的一个主要部分。
    这种政治迫害手段所以有效，是因为要提出反面的证明是不可能的。罗森堡夫妇被判处死刑，因为他们不承认加给他们的罪名，不肯告发“共谋者”而又不能证明自己没有作过诬告他们的罪。——当然，被判罪，实际上只是因为他们曾经参加合法的进步活动，并无任何证据证明他们真正有罪。这种审讯和调查只是要给予公众一种暗示，即一切进步活动都是叛逆活动。共产党领袖被关入监狱，是因为被指控“阴谋煽动以暴力推翻政府”，虽然并没有证据证明他们使用过或者鼓吹过暴力。
    到目前为止，美国最活动的进步分子，不是被法院以“阴谋煽动罪”审讯，就是受到国会委员会的处罚。虽然法律上国会委员会没有处罚的权力，但事实上它对不屈服的人，能够在社会上或经济上给予毁灭性的打击。美国政府不惜以任何代价来进行反进步运动，包括广泛使用警察特务的办法。政治警察监视着每一个曾经是活动的进步分子的人，任何时候只要认为必要，就可以在一两小时内将他们逮捕。
    完全照样地采用希特勒的手段来对付进步分子，或者明令取缔进步刊物，不符合政府现行的策略。他们的策略是：在孤立并限制进步运动活动的同时，仍然能够向深受宣传毒害的美国公众吹嘘“美国民主”。共产党是“合法”的，不过倘若你参加了，你就可以在任何时候被以完全莫须有的罪名而被逮捕下狱。进步刊物可以出版，然而却受到书籍和报刊销售商人的抵制，并且政治警察采用威吓手段来阻止购买者。例如独立的“国民前卫”周刊的读者，经常受到政治警察的访问，“劝告”他们不再订阅。威胁的办法之一是：如果老板发现，就会失掉工作。这并不只是虚张声势。订阅者时常必须在订一份进步报刊和失业两者之间权衡轻重。但是从技术上来说，订阅杂志是完全合法和充分自由的。美国绝大部分人甚至不知道有这些事情发生，如果你告诉他们，他们会说你是说谎。
    自由的外表容易使政治上不成熟的人得出一个错误的结论：进步运动对美国毫无贡献，因为如果不是这样，这个运动就不致于如此弱小。官方宣传不断将进步运动说成是外来的而且可憎的。不少正派的但被导入歧途的美国人相信了这种宣传。
    在美国的进步运动中，黑人的社会和经济平等问题仍然居于重要地位。自从最高法院颁布取消学校的黑白种儿童隔离的法令以后，这一问题比以往得到了更多人的支持。今天黑人在广大白种人群众支持下，对取消各种形式的种族歧视和否认黑人选举权利，展开最坚决和最有效的斗争。
    黑种产业工人受到重重剥削。整个说来，他们的收入比白种同行少得多。他们的生活格外没有保障，经常“最后被雇而最先被解雇”，在提升机会上受到严格限制。他们时常不能和白种工人平等地参加工会。他们要参加进步的团体，得冒更大的危险。
    今天，受到同等的或更加残酷剥削的，但不大为国外人所知道的其他少数民族，就是西南部的墨西哥人和主要聚居在纽约市的波多黎各人。波多黎各是美国在半世纪以前从西班牙手中夺来的一个西印度岛屿。近来给予形式多于实际的自治。约五十万波多黎各人移居到了美国，经受着残酷的剥削。
    在美国，小农和老年人是对自身受剥削有觉悟并且较比能接受进步思想的阶层。美国始终没有树立像中国、非洲和其他地方所有的一种传统：照顾老人是家庭的义务。老年人经常生活于半饥饿状态。他们在美国各地，特别是在西北部，是一个有组织的战斗力。小农是美国喜欢夸耀的“严格的个人主义者”的传统象征。但是现在，他们受到介于他们和市场之间的那些经纪人的勒索。此外，采取城市大企业经营方式、他们无法与其竞争的大规模机械化农场也对他们进攻。在这双重攻击下他们被挤垮了。经验已使许多小农看破了欺骗的宣传，这种宣传使许多城市居民看不清在繁荣景象背面的资本主义的不治之症。
    美国的进步分子体会到，近十年来，美国人不关心世事的倾向有了相当程度的发展。标榜“美国精神”的反动派的冷战得势后，恐惧窒息了抗议的声音。然而，两年前苏联农业代表团来美国访问时，美国人民中间的传统的善邻遗风再度流露出来了。这个代表团受到了保守的农业州居民热烈而诚挚的欢迎。
    如果中国的代表团在对等的基础上访问美国，没有理由认为他们不会得到类似的欢迎。美国政府对待中国的态度，丝毫不能反映广大阶层人民的态度，甚至也不能反映相当多的企业界人士的态度。这些人是眼看其他国家进行着有利的对华贸易，因而也急于有所行动。已经不可能再使一般美国人相信，中国人民在朝鲜战争中保卫自己的边境是犯了“侵略”罪行。美国人知道——即使他们没有说出来——在同样的局势下他们的国家也会采取相同的措施和行动的。他们对朝鲜战争从来一点也不表示热心。许多美国人认为蒋介石是一个无赖，另外一些人认为他愚蠢。在最近一期的“生活”杂志上，蒋介石奴颜婢膝地恳求美国发动一次反对中国的十字军运动。他坚持美国必须组织和领导这个运动，而将肮脏的勾当交给亚洲人去干。美国人不会被这种荒谬的言论所欺骗。他们知道他们将因此被卷入战争，而这样的一种战争对他们只有百害而无一利。
    经验是最伟大的导师。谈到对中华人民共和国或者其他社会主义国家进行战争，朝鲜的记忆犹新。至于国内的情况，庞大的战争工业支持下的资本主义繁荣是建筑在沙土之上的。美国人民普遍地从经验中明白这一点的日子会要到来，生活的现实将提高美国人民的觉悟。目前不论就数量或影响说虽然都还是不够大的美国进步运动，比以往更加充满了坚强的信心。它认识到，当繁荣的不稳固的基础在群众中暴露时，重担就要落在它的肩上。
