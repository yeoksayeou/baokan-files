Yesterday, the music community in the capital commemorated Mr. Liu Tianhua, a renowned Chinese national musician.

Mr. Liu Tianhua was born in 1895 into a family of intellectuals who advocated for new learning. Due to poverty, he had to leave middle school at the age of sixteen and make a living through his own labor. He worked as a teacher while also studying with folk artists, diligently researching national musical instruments such as the erhu and pipa. He learned and applied his knowledge diligently, living a modest life as a music teacher for twenty years. In 1932, he died of an infectious disease at the young age of thirty-seven. His collected works were published posthumously with the help of donations from eight schools and organizations.

Influenced by the New Culture Movement around the May Fourth period, Liu Tianhua was determined to build "the music that awakens the soul of a nation" [Note 1] in the face of "national poverty and financial exhaustion." He opposed "using music as a toy for the aristocracy" [Note 2] and advocated "popularizing music among the general public" [Note 3]. Guided by this thought, he chose the erhu, which was despised by those high-minded musicians at the time, as the main tool to realize his artistic ideals—although he initially studied Western musical instruments and never stopped studying the violin until his death.

He centered his activities on the erhu, expanding into performance, composition, teaching, and research. First, he humbly sought instruction from folk artists, thoroughly mastered traditional erhu playing techniques, and summarized their experience. Then, referring to the playing techniques and teaching methods of the violin, he founded a new erhu school and cultivated a group of students. It can be said that all the erhu teachers in various music academies today are successors of this school.

Through his efforts, the erhu took a step forward in terms of performance skills, manufacturing, notation, and teaching methods. More importantly, he created ten excellent solo pieces for the erhu, using musical images to depict the spiritual outlook of intellectuals during the period from the May Fourth Movement to the Second Domestic Revolutionary War, who were dissatisfied with the rule of the authorities but could not combine their fate with that of the working people. His erhu compositions "Sickbed Rhapsody" (also known as "Comfortable?"), "Elegy" (also known as "The Difficulty of Living in the World"), "Song of Melancholy" (also known as "Joy in Suffering"), and "Solo String Meditation" (also known as "Song of Worry") brilliantly, delicately, and typically portrayed the inner world of this group of intellectuals, while other works such as "Bright Road," "Birds in the Empty Mountains," and "Moonlit Night" expressed yearning for a better life. These ten erhu pieces, as well as three other pipa pieces and one ensemble piece, are the most precious gains in music composition of that period.

He was also one of the first people in China to use more scientific methods to organize and study national music. The erhu and pipa textbooks he compiled, the "Mei Lanfang Song Scores," the "Anci County Chaozi Opera Music Score," and his compositions, provided us with valuable experience in inheriting and carrying forward the excellent traditions of national music.

Liu Tianhua's artistic views and educational thoughts basically did not go beyond the bourgeois ideological system. However, influenced by the May Fourth Movement and the ideas of the First Domestic Revolutionary War, they contained many positive and progressive elements. In the "Origins" of the "National Music Improvement Society" organized by Liu Tianhua and others, they said: "Although there are people learning to play the piano and sing songs of the Westerners, they are mostly aristocratic. To popularize music among the general public is truly a distant matter." Of course, the "public" in their minds was actually an audience mainly composed of petty-bourgeois intellectuals, which had a different class content from the masses we are talking about, but compared with those musicians who advocated wholesale Westernization and sang that music was the "language of the upper world," it can be affirmed that he was a democratic and patriotic musician.

He was a national musician, but he opposed the propositions of the national essence faction that advocated restoration and rejected Western music culture. He believed that "the culture of a country can never be considered complete by simply copying the superficial aspects of others, nor can it be considered complete by stubbornly adhering to old methods and stubbornly sticking to one's own opinions." He advocated introducing Western music and learning from the strengths of others while promoting national music. It is precisely because of this that he was able to become an innovator of national music and make brilliant contributions to the development of national instrumental music.

Mr. Liu Tianhua has been dead for twenty-five years. In these twenty-five years, China has undergone world-shaking, historical changes. What music pioneers like Liu Tianhua considered "distant" has been realized one by one, and far exceeded their imagination. More importantly, the music cause of the new China has not only combined the ideals of music pioneers with the musical life of the people, but has also accomplished a major event unprecedented in the history of music—liberating music from the hands of a few and returning it to all the working people who created the motherland's musical culture. Only in this way can we truly build a prosperous national music culture.

    刘天华逝世25周年祭	李元庆
    昨天，首都音乐界纪念了我国著名的民族音乐家刘天华先生。
    刘天华先生在1895年生在一个主张新学的知识分子家庭中。由于家境贫寒，十六岁时，便不得不离开中学校，靠自己的劳动来谋生活。他一方面当教员，一方面求教于民间艺人，刻苦钻研二胡、琵琶等民族乐器，边学边用，勤勤恳恳地过了二十年清贫的音乐教员生活。1932年因为得传染病，只三十七岁便死去了。他的作品集在死后依靠八个学校和团体的捐助，才得刊行于世。
    受到“五四”前后新文化运动的影响的刘天华，立志要在“民穷财尽”的情形下兴建起“那唤醒一个民族灵魂的音乐”〔注一〕来。他反对“以音乐为贵族们的玩具”〔注二〕，主张“把音乐普及到一般民众”〔注三〕中去。在这种思想指导下，他选定了在当时被那些清高的音乐家们鄙视的二胡，作为实现自己艺术理想的主要工具——虽然他最初是学习西洋乐器的，并且直到逝世前也没有停止过小提琴的进修。
    他以二胡为中心，展开了演奏、创作、教学，研究各方面的活动。他首先向艺人虚心求教，透彻地掌握了传统的二胡演奏技法，总结了他们的经验，然后参考小提琴的演奏技法和教学法，创立了一个新的二胡学派，培养了一批学生。可以说，目前各音乐院校所有的二胡教师，都是这个学派的继承者。
    经过他的努力，使二胡无论在演技、制造、记谱法、教学法上都向前跨进了一步。更重要的是他为二胡创作了十首优秀的独奏曲，用音乐的形象描绘了“五四”到第二次国内革命战争期间那些既不满意当权者的统治、又不能把自己的命运和劳动人民的命运结合起来的知识分子的精神面貌。他的二胡曲“病中吟”（又名“安适？”）、“悲歌”（又名“处世难”）、“苦闷之歌”（又名“苦中乐”）“独弦操”（又名“忧心曲”）出色地、细致地、典型地刻划了这部分知识分子的内心世界，而另一些作品如“光明行”、“空山鸟语”、“月夜”，又表达了对于美好的生活的憧憬。这十首二胡曲以及另外三首琵琶曲、一首合奏曲，是同时期音乐创作中最珍贵的收获。
    他又是我国最早采用较科学的方法整理研究民族音乐的人。他编写的二胡及琵琶教材，他所写的“梅兰芳歌曲谱”、“安次县吵子会乐谱”和他的创作一样，为我们在继承和发扬民族音乐优良传统方面提供了宝贵的经验。
    刘天华的艺术观和教育思想基本上并没有超越过资产阶级思想体系。但是由于受到五四运动和第一次国内革命的思想影响，其中包含了不少积极的、进步的因素。在刘天华等人组织的“国乐改进社”的“缘起”中，他们说：“虽然现在也有人在那里学着西人弹琴唱歌，大都还只是贵族式的，要说把音乐普及到一般民众，这真是一件万分渺远的事”。当然，在他们心目中的“民众”，其实只是以市民阶级知识分子为主体的听众，和我们所说的群众有着不同的阶级内容，但和当时那些主张全盘西化，高唱音乐是“上界的语言”的音乐家们相比较，就可以肯定他是一个民主的爱国的音乐家了。
    他是国乐家，但反对那些主张复古、排斥西洋音乐文化的国粹派的主张。他认为“一国的文化，也断然不是抄袭些别人的皮毛就可以算数的，反过来说，也不是死守老法，固执己见，就可以算数的”。他主张在提倡民族音乐的同时，也要介绍西洋音乐，学习别人的长处。正因为如此，他才能成为一个民族音乐的革新家，在发展民族器乐上作出光辉的贡献。
    刘天华先生逝世已经二十五年了。在这二十五年中，中国发生了震撼全世界的、历史性的变化。刘天华等音乐先辈们认为“万分渺远”的事，都一一实现了，并且远远的超过了他们的想像。更重要的是新中国的音乐事业不仅把音乐先辈的理想和人民的音乐生活结合起来了，并且完成了一件音乐史上未曾有过的大事——把音乐从少数人手中解放出来，交还给创造了祖国音乐文化的全体劳动人民。只有这样，才能真正建设起繁荣的民族音乐文化来。
