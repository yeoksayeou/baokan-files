    Over a Thousand People Participate in Labor
    In early November, more than 1,500 faculty, students, and staff from Nanjing University went to agricultural production cooperatives in Gaoqiaomen, Meijialang, Guangyang, and other areas of the Nanjing Mausoleum District to help farmers with the rush harvest and planting. They participated in various agricultural tasks such as cutting rice, threshing rice, plowing, tilling, pulling beans, and watering, showing great enthusiasm.
    Guo Yingqiu, the president of Nanjing University, and the Communist Youth League secretary led over a thousand students from the South Garden on foot to the agricultural cooperative and immediately enthusiastically joined the labor, helping the farmers cut and thresh rice. President Guo bent over, wielding a sickle to lead the rice cutting. During breaks, President Guo also told everyone two stories of combat.
    Seed Training Class
    Starting this semester, the Seed Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Agriculture and Zhejiang Agricultural College are jointly running a seed training class. Provinces have selected technical cadres who have engaged in practical seed work to study here. The study period is tentatively set for six months, and the course content includes seed science, seed testing, genetic breeding, improved variety development, and seed diseases, insects, and weeds. During the study period, in addition to lectures, experts from outside the school will be invited to give special reports to enrich the content of study.

    在学校里
    千余人参加劳动
    南京大学一千五百多位师生员工分别于11月初，到南京陵园区高桥门、梅家廊、广洋等农业生产合作社帮助农民抢收抢种。他们参加了割稻、打稻、翻土、犁田、拔豆、浇水等各种农业劳动，情绪十分饱满。
    南京大学校长郭影秋和团委书记带了一千多名学生从南园步行到农业社后，立即热情地投入劳动，帮助农民割稻子、打稻子。郭校长弯着腰，挥动镰刀带头割稻。在休息的时候，郭校长还为大家讲了两个战斗故事。
