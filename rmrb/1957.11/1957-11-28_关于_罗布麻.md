    About "Apocynum venetum"	Dong Zhengjun, Chinese Academy of Sciences

    After the article "Apocynum venetum" was published on page 5 of the People's Daily on September 20th, readers and relevant organizations from all over the country have been writing to me continuously. Some asked about the cultivation methods of Apocynum venetum, some asked where to find seedlings, some sent specimens of similar plants for identification, some asked about the methods of stripping and degumming the fiber, and so on. Some saline-alkali soil areas even sent people to discuss it. In order to meet the needs of readers and to promote the utilization of Apocynum venetum, I will now answer the main questions raised by readers from all over the country below.
            Morphology of Apocynum venetum
    Apocynum venetum belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is temporarily divided into two types in China: red hemp and white hemp. White hemp has green stems, a plant height of three chi (Chinese foot, same below) to seven and a half chi, and many branches. The leaves are oval or lanceolate, opposite or alternate. The flowers are pink, facing downwards in a bell shape, three fen long, the upper end of the corolla is five-lobed, the lower end is united, each petal has three deep purple veins, the five stamens are golden yellow, arrow-shaped, and surrounded by the green stamens, with nectar glands, making it a good honey source plant. In autumn, each flower bears a pair of long horn-shaped fruits, the horns are green, seven cun five fen to one chi five cun long, the seeds are small and brown, about seven fen five li long, and two fen one li in diameter. Each seed has a bunch of white fluff, and when the fruit matures, it splits open on its own, and the seeds are carried far away by the wind with the fluff.
    Red hemp has purplish-red stems (green in the shaded area), a plant height of four chi five cun to nine chi, and a maximum of twelve chi, with fewer branches. The leaves are opposite or alternate, lanceolate. The flowers are small, purplish-red or pink, in the shape of a short trumpet, about three fen long, with five petals arranged at the upper end, each petal also has three dark purple veins. The fruit is purplish-red and shorter. Other structures are the same as white hemp.
    Whether white hemp or red hemp, if the roots, stems, or leaves are cut, the cortex can flow out a large amount of white milky liquid, and white, shiny, and strong fibers can be peeled out by hand on the inner surface of the stem cortex.
    White hemp has strong drought and salt tolerance. It can even grow in wasteland with a salt layer of more than three cun thick on the surface, as long as the groundwater level is not lower than nine chi to twelve chi. It is mostly distributed in Qinghai, Xinjiang, Hexi in Gansu, and Ejina Qi in Inner Mongolia. Red hemp has weaker salt and drought resistance. In addition to being distributed in the above-mentioned areas, it is also found in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River and north of the Huaihe Qinling Mountains, reaching Chengde in Inner Mongolia and Dalian in the north, especially in the coastal light saline-alkali wasteland of Shandong, Hebei, and northern Jiangsu.
    Cultivation Methods
    According to the preliminary results of small-scale experiments, four methods, namely sowing, root division, transplanting, and cutting, can be used to propagate Apocynum venetum. However, the division and transplanting method grows the fastest, reaching a height of two chi one cun in the same year, and can flower and be harvested. In the second year, it can grow to four chi three cun five fen high, and the yield can be increased by two times compared with the first year. The seedlings grown by root cuttings are one chi six cun five fen high in the same year, and can also flower and be harvested. In the second year, they are about four chi two cun high, and the yield can also be increased by two times compared with the first year. The sowing method results in plants that are six to nine cun high in the same year, do not flower, and have no harvest. In the second year, they are about three chi nine cun high and can flower and be harvested. In some local experiments, after sowing, people saw that the plants only grew nine cun high in the same year, and mistakenly thought that it was not suitable for growth in the local area and pulled them out, which is a great pity! The growth of the cutting method is similar to that of the root cutting method, but the survival rate is lower.
    All localities can determine the method of artificial propagation according to the distance from the seedling area and transportation conditions. However, attention should be paid to the following points:
    (1) The seeds should be sown in the second year after collection. If they are separated by one year, it will be difficult to germinate. According to the preliminary experience of the Korla Experimental Farm in Xinjiang, it is advisable to soak the seeds in clean water for 24 hours before sowing, then spread them on a wooden board to dry, about one cun thick, turn them over every two or three hours, and spray water to moisten them when they are too dry. They can germinate in twelve to twenty-four hours, and then sow them. Seedlings can emerge when the soil temperature is at two degrees Celsius, and the best emergence is at eight degrees Celsius. Seedlings will emerge neatly three or four days after sowing, otherwise, the emergence will be slow and uneven. Because the seeds are small, the land should be well prepared before sowing, and the seeds should be mixed with fine soil and fertilizer. Sow six fen deep, and gently cover the soil and compact it after sowing. After emergence, straw can be used to cover to prevent it from being too dry or too wet. After survival, attention should be paid to weeding and pest control at any time.
    (2) For root cutting planting, the roots should be stored in moist soil after being dug out (they can be stored for about half a month), each segment should be three cun to five cun long, and it is better to have buds. Plant about three cun deep, and seedlings can emerge when the soil temperature is at ten degrees Celsius.
    (3) The division and transplanting method can only be applied within a short distance. The planting depth is the same as the root cutting method.
    (4) The planting period is in early spring. All localities can determine according to the climate, generally after the land thaws, around the Spring Equinox to Qingming Festival.
    (5) Regardless of which method is adopted for planting, attention should be paid to the soil moisture. It should not be too dry. If it is too dry, it should be irrigated. It can be drought-resistant only when the root system is well developed and reaches six to nine Chinese feet underground, and can absorb groundwater. The groundwater level is best three chi to six chi. In arid areas, it should not be lower than twelve chi. Whether the groundwater level can be lower in areas with higher rainfall remains to be studied.
    (6) When cultivating on saline-alkali land, attention should be paid to digging up the salt layer with heavier salt accumulation on the surface and planting it on the lower (below nine cun) soil layer with lighter salt content, so that it can survive easily. It should not be planted on the salt accumulation layer because it has salt tolerance. When planting on salt soil, irrigation should be strictly prohibited, because the surface salt will dissolve when it meets water, and the salt water will seep into the lower root area, and the seedlings will die.
    (7) Planting density: According to a typical survey of wasteland in Lijin County, Shandong, the denser the plants, the fewer the branches, the taller the plants, and the better the quality. Therefore, in artificial cultivation, each mu can be designed to maintain more than 60,000 plants, and the maximum can reach 90,000 plants. However, the reproductive capacity of Apocynum venetum roots is very strong, and both horizontal and vertical roots can reproduce. In the wild, they grow in clusters, with more than ten plants in each cluster, and only two plants in the fewest. The exact plant spacing needs to be tested.
    (8) Harvesting period: After the flowers fall and before the seeds mature. The most suitable specific time is yet to be tested.
    (9) The amount of yield should be determined according to the height and density of growth. For plants with a height of four chi five cun to six chi, about one jin of raw hemp can be produced for every hundred plants, and half a jin of fiber can be obtained after degumming. The fiber yield rate is about 15%. After three years of cultivation, the root system is well developed, and it can be harvested twice a year. Preliminary estimates show that after formal cultivation, each mu can yield about 200 to 300 jin or more of raw hemp.
    (10) The surviving roots can live for more than 30 years after planting. As long as weeding and management are carried out every year, they can be harvested on time, which is more labor-saving to operate.
    Purchase of Seedlings
    Those who are interested in conducting experiments can entrust the following locations to collect according to local natural conditions:
    (1) Shandong Agricultural Department or the People's Committee of Guangrao County and Lijin County, to obtain seeds (or roots) from Da Gudaodao Island, and select good varieties with a plant height of more than six chi.
    The above two counties are both red hemp, with the local name "Chakezi."
    (2) Gansu Agricultural Department or the People's Committee of Minqin and Jiuquan County, to obtain local red hemp or white hemp seedlings (local name "Yema") with a plant height of more than four chi five cun.
    (3) Qinghai Agricultural Department or Golmud Local Committee or Golmud State-owned Farm, to obtain red hemp or white hemp seedlings with a plant height of about six chi, the white hemp in this area has extremely strong salt tolerance, and the local name is "Zhaha."
    (4) Xinjiang Agricultural Department or the People's Committee of Yuli County or Army Farm, to obtain red hemp and white hemp from Xingdi Mountain on the north bank of the Peacock River more than 200 li east of the county seat, especially the red hemp from Xingdi Mountain is the best, with a plant height of nine chi to twelve chi, tall and straight, with few branches, thick fiber layer, and easy to peel, which is the best of the currently known varieties. However, this variety has weaker salt and drought resistance. The local Uyghur name is "Taughchiqan."
    Yanqi Troops, to obtain red hemp from Rouzi and Hetian (plant height about nine chi) and white hemp from Bosten Lake (plant height four chi five cun to six chi), which has extremely strong salt tolerance and can grow on wasteland with a salt accumulation of four cun and a half thick on the surface when the groundwater level is about three chi. The local Han name is Yema, and the Mongolian name is Sailikeaolesi.
    Liugou and Anjihai Army Farms, to obtain red hemp and white hemp seedlings with a plant height of about six chi (local Han name is Yema, Uyghur name is Yewuqigan and Taughchiqan). The red hemp in Anjihai has very few branches.
    Aksu Victory Farm, to obtain red hemp (about nine chi high) and white hemp (about six chi high) seedlings from Huangong and Yinmaopa.
    (5) Jiangsu Dongtai County People's Committee, to obtain local red hemp seeds (local name Yechaye or Yeyechaye), which grows on saline-alkali wasteland and is the southernmost and highest rainfall (about nine cun) area in the known Apocynum venetum distribution area.
    (6) Xinjiang Fuyun County Army Farm, to obtain red hemp and white hemp seeds from Koktokay, which is the northernmost and coldest (-40°C or below) area in the known Apocynum venetum distribution area.
            Apocynum venetum Processing Methods
    (1) Hemp Stripping. An Apocynum venetum hemp stripping machine has recently been developed. You can contact the Wulin Iron Factory on Wulin Road, Hangzhou, to order it. It can strip more than 50 jin of raw hemp (hemp skin) per hour. Ordering a complete set of machines (hemp stripping machine and hemp combing machine) in large quantities costs about 500 yuan. Driven by a three-horsepower diesel engine, the hemp stripping cost per jin of raw hemp is about one jiao. If you strip it by hand, you can soak the hemp plants in water for several days, take them out, let them dry, and then strip them. Each person can strip more than two jin per day. If the soaking time is too long, the fibers will be in a free state and it will not be easy to strip.
    (2) Degumming. Raw hemp has too much gum, and the gum must be removed before it can be used for spinning. It is best to set up a degumming factory to degum with chemical methods. The degumming cost per three jin of fiber is about one yuan (the cost can be further reduced when producing in large quantities). One jin of fiber can be obtained after degumming two jin of raw hemp. A degumming factory that produces one ton of fiber per day requires an investment of more than one million yuan. If manual degumming is used, according to preliminary tests, there are the following two methods.
    (1) Add about one and a half jin of white alkali and one jin of oil (animal and vegetable oil) (or no oil) to 100 jin of water and boil in a pot.
    (2) Add twelve and a half jin of Hutong alkali (soil alkali from the Northwest) and one jin of clear oil to 100 jin of water and boil in a pot.
    After boiling the raw hemp for two or three hours, the gum falls off, and then take it out and wash it in clean water (to prevent the alkali from corroding the hemp or add a little sulfuric acid to neutralize it in clean water) to obtain fiber. The specific amount of alkali and oil to be used should be studied by various localities.
    The history of Apocynum venetum discovery in China is very short, and our investigation and research have only just begun and have not yet achieved definite achievements. We hope that comrades from all over the country will refer to the above information and conduct further research based on local conditions, and tell us the results (success or failure) to jointly promote the rapid development of Apocynum venetum, so that Apocynum venetum can make its due contribution to the people as soon as possible!

专栏：答读者

    关于“罗布麻”	中国科学院　董正钧
    人民日报9月20日第五版发表了“罗布麻”一文之后，各地读者和有关机关不断地写信给我。有的问罗布麻的栽培方法，有的问到哪里找种苗，有的把类似植物的标本寄来叫鉴定，有的问剥麻与脱胶的方法等等。有的盐碱土地区还派人前来洽谈。为了满足读者的要求，也为了推广利用罗布麻，现将各地读者提出的主要问题答复于后。
            罗布麻的形态
    罗布麻属夹竹桃科，我国暂分为红麻和白麻两种。白麻茎绿色株高三尺（市尺、以下同）至七尺半，分枝很多。叶椭圆形或披针形，对生或互生。花为粉红色，口向下成吊钟形，长三分，花冠上端五裂，下端连合，每瓣有三条深紫色脉纹，雄蕊五枚金黄色，箭头形，包围在绿色的雄蕊外面，有蜜腺，为良好的蜜源植物。秋天，每朵花结一对长角状果实，角绿色，长七寸五至一尺五分，种子细小褐色，长七分五厘左右，直径二分一厘。每粒种子上有一束白色绒毛，成熟后果实自行裂开，种子便借绒毛随风飞送远处。
    红麻茎紫红色（背阴部绿色），株高四尺五寸至九尺，最高的十二尺，分枝较少。叶对生或互生，披针形。花小，紫红色或粉红色，成短喇叭形，长三分左右，上端列成五瓣，每瓣也有三条暗紫色脉纹。果实紫红色，较短。其他构造跟白麻一样。
    无论白麻或红麻，若把根、茎或叶切断，皮层都能流出大量白色乳状液，在茎的皮层内面用手可剥出白色光亮而坚牢的纤维。
    白麻的耐旱耐盐性很强，甚至在地表结有三寸多厚盐层的荒地上，只要地下水位不低于九尺至十二尺仍能生长。多分布在青海、新疆、甘肃河西和内蒙额济纳齐一带。红麻的耐盐和耐旱性较弱，除分布在上述地区以外，在长江下游和淮河秦岭以北，向北直达内蒙承德和大连等处都有，尤以山东河北和苏北沿海的轻盐碱荒地上最多。
    栽培的方法
    根据小量试验的初步结果，播种、分根、移植、插条，四种方法都可以繁殖罗布麻。不过以分株移植法生长最快，当年可长二尺一寸高，并能开花收获，第二年可长四尺三寸五分高，产量比第一年能增加二倍。切根种植的当年高一尺六寸五分，也能开花收获，第二年高四尺二寸左右，产量也可比第一年增加二倍。播种法当年高六至九寸，不开花，也无收获，第二年高三尺九寸左右，可以开花收获。有的地方试验时，播种后看到当年只长九寸高，便误以为本地不宜生长而拔掉了，是很可惜的！插条法生长情况与切根法差不多，只是成活率较低。
    各地可根据距离种苗地区的远近与交通条件决定人工繁殖的方法。不过，应注意以下各点：
    （一）种子采取后第二年就要播种，若隔一年即难发芽。据新疆库尔勒试验场的初步经验，在播种前宜用清水先泡种子二十四小时，再摊在木板上凉干，厚一寸左右，每隔二、三小时翻一次，过于干燥时就喷水使润，过十二至二十四小时就可萌芽，然后播种。土地温度在摄氏二度时即可出苗，八度时出苗最好，播后三、四日即整齐出苗，否则出苗慢而不齐。因为种子细小，所以在播种前应很好的整地，并用细土与肥料拌种。播深六分，播后轻轻复土镇压。出苗后可用柴草遮盖，以防过干或过湿。成活后并应随时注意锄草与防虫害。
    （二）用切根法种植的，把根挖出后应在湿土中保存好（可保存半个月左右），每段长三寸至五寸即可，有芽眼的更好。种深三寸左右，地温摄氏十度时即可出苗。
    （三）分株移植法只能在短距离内应用。种植深度和挖根法一样。
    （四）种植期在早春。各地可根据气候而定，一般在土地解冻以后，大约春分至清明前后。
    （五）不论采取哪一种方法种植，都应注意土壤的湿度，不能过干，过干应灌水，等根系发育健全，深达地下六至九市尺，能够吸取地下水时，才能耐旱，地下水位最好三尺至六尺，在干旱地区，最低不宜低于十二尺，在雨量较高的地区，地下水位是否还可以再低尚待研究。
    （六）在盐碱地上栽培时，应注意把地表积盐较重的盐土层挖开，种在下部（九寸以下）盐分较轻的土层上才易成活，不能因其有耐盐性而种在盐聚层上。在盐土上种植时，应严禁灌水，因地表盐分遇水就会溶解，盐水渗到下层根部附近，种苗就会死亡。
    （七）种植密度：根据在山东利津县荒地的典型调查，株间愈密，分枝愈少，植株愈高，品质也愈好。所以人工栽培时，每亩可按保苗六万株以上设计，最高可达九万株。但是罗布麻根的繁殖力很强，横根与竖根皆可繁殖，在野外皆成簇状生长，每一簇多的十余株，少的只二株，株距究应若干，尚需进行试验。
    （八）收割期：在落花以后，种子成熟以前。最适宜的具体时间还待试验。
    （九）产量的多少，应依生长的高度与密度而定，株高四尺五寸至六尺左右的，每一百株约产原麻一斤，脱胶后可得纤维半斤。出麻率为15％左右。栽培三年以后，根系发育健全，每年还可收割两次。初步推算，正式栽培以后，每亩约可收原麻二百至三百斤以上。
    （十）种活以后宿根可活三十年以上，每年只要进行锄草管理，即可按期收割，经营比较省工。
    种苗的采购
    有志进行试验的，可以根据当地自然条件委托下列各地采集：
    （一）山东农业厅或广饶县、利津县人民委员会，要大孤岛的种子（或根）须选株高六尺以上的良种。
    以上二县都是红麻、土名“茶棵子”。
    （二）甘肃农业厅或民勤和酒泉县人民委员会，要当地株高四尺五寸以上的红麻或白麻种苗（土名叫“野麻”）。
    （三）青海农业厅或葛尔穆地方委员会或葛尔穆国营农场，要株高六尺左右的红麻或白麻种苗，该区白麻耐盐力极强，当地土名“札哈”。
    （四）新疆农业厅或尉犁县人民委员会或部队农场，要县城以东二百多华里孔雀河北岸兴地山的红麻及白麻，尤以兴地山的红麻最好，株高九尺至十二尺，株高而直，分枝少，纤维层厚，也易剥皮，是目前已知品种中最好的一种，惟此种耐盐及耐旱性较弱。当地维族土名“陶格其干”。
    焉耆部队，要肉孜和田的红麻（株高九尺左右）和波斯腾湖滨的白麻（株高四尺半至六尺），耐盐力极强，在地下水位三尺左右时能在地表积盐四寸半厚的荒地上生长。当地汉族名野麻，蒙古族名赛力克奥尔斯。
    柳沟及安集海部队农场要株高六尺左右的红麻及白麻种苗（当地汉族名野麻，维族名野务其干及陶格其干）。安集海的红麻分枝很少。
    阿克苏胜利农场，要皇宫和因毛帕下的红麻（高九尺左右）及白麻（高六尺左右）种苗。
    （五）江苏东台县人民委员会，要当地红麻种子，（土名野茶叶或野叶茶），生在盐碱荒地上，是已知罗布麻分布区最南及雨量最高（九寸左右）的地方。
    （六）新疆富蕴县部队农场，要可可托海的红麻和白麻种子，是已知罗布麻分布区中最北及最冷（—40℃以下）的地方。
            罗布麻加工方法
    （一）剥麻。最近已研究出罗布麻剥麻机。可以到杭州武林路武林铁工厂接洽订制。它每小时可剥原麻（麻皮）五十斤以上。大量订制全套机器（剥麻机和梳麻机）大约要五百多元。用三匹马力柴油机带动，每斤原麻的剥麻成本约一角左右。如用手剥，可把麻株放在水中沤泡数日取出凉干再剥，每天每人约可剥二斤以上。若沤时过长，纤维成游离状态，就不易剥。
    （二）脱胶。原麻胶质太多，必脱去胶质才能供纺织应用。最好设脱胶厂，用化学方法脱胶，每三斤纤维的脱胶成本约一元左右（大量生产时还可研究降低）。每二斤原麻脱胶后可得一斤纤维，每天产一吨纤维的脱胶厂约需投资一百多万元。若用手工脱胶，据初步试验，有以下两种方法。
    （一）水一百斤加白碱一斤半左右再加油（动植物油）一斤（或不用油），放锅内煮沸。
    （二）水一百斤加胡桐碱十二斤半（西北的土碱）加清油一斤，放锅内煮沸。
    把原麻煮二、三小时后，胶质脱落，即取出放清水中洗净（以免碱质腐蚀麻质或在清水中加少许硫酸中和之）即得纤维。具体用碱与油的数量，还要各地自行研究。
    罗布麻在我国发现的历史很短，我们的调查研究也只是才开始，尚未能得到肯定的成就，尚希各地同志参考上述的资料，根据本地情况，作进一步的研究，并将结果（成功或失败）告诉我们，共同推动罗布麻迅速向前发展，使罗布麻提早对人民做出应有的贡献！
