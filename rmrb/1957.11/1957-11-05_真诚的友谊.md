    Sincere Friendship
    Guo Jiyun, Director of Harbin Flax Textile Factory
    The 40th anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution is approaching. In these unforgettable days, the kind figures of Soviet experts appear before our eyes again, as if it were just yesterday.
    The fertile Songhua River valley abounds in flax, but during the Japanese imperialists' rule of Northeast China, this became a bitter experience for the people of Northeast China. The flax they planted with their own blood and sweat could not be used by themselves but was plundered by the Japanese imperialists and transported to Japan as textile raw materials. Before liberation, the only small flax textile factory was completely destroyed. After liberation, a large amount of flax fiber was stockpiled in the hands of flax farmers, so the establishment of a flax textile factory was of great significance for the effective utilization of this abundant resource, ensuring the production of flax farmers and supplying the needs of the people's lives.
    The preparation for the construction of the Harbin Flax Textile Factory was before the founding of the People's Republic of China. At that time, we had neither flax textile technicians nor experience in organizing large-scale production. Under such difficult circumstances, the Soviet people extended a hand of friendship and provided comprehensive and selfless assistance to the construction of the factory. Therefore, the Harbin Flax Textile Factory became a prelude to our country's large-scale economic construction and also the earliest factory built with the help of the Soviet people.
    In the process of building the factory, from surveying, designing, construction, installation to starting production, everything was carried out with the kind help of Soviet experts. As early as the summer of 1949, the Soviet government sent us design experts who completed the preliminary design after about three months of surveying and investigation, determining the raw materials, production capacity, varieties, factory location and other issues. During this period, in order to understand the planting of flax raw materials, the processing of raw materials and the quality of the fiber, the experts braved the hot weather to go to the raw material producing areas for on-the-spot investigations. In order to determine the spinning performance of the fiber, they also sent some flax fiber to the Soviet Union for testing. After this series of work, the factory design plan was finally determined. Soviet workers manufactured the latest flax textile equipment for us outside of the plan. This production equipment was concentrated with the latest technological achievements in the Soviet flax textile industry at that time. Many of these equipments were the No. 1, 2, and 3 products of the Soviet machine manufacturing factories. For example, ring spinning flax wet spinning machines, bleaching combined machines, dyeing combined machines, etc. were just beginning to be used in the Soviet Union. It is said that the looms in our factory were specially designed by Soviet designers according to the shorter stature of Chinese workers, which shows how sincere and meticulous the Soviet Union's assistance to our country was.
    In the process of building the factory and production, Soviet experts enthusiastically taught and passed on to us many valuable advanced experiences, which saved us a lot of funds, accelerated the progress of the project and ensured the quality of the project. For example, under the guidance of experts, our factory first implemented winter construction and factory construction methods, and successfully trial-produced foam concrete and fire-resistant floors for the first time in the history of Chinese construction. During this period, Soviet experts also helped us train a large number of technical forces. The workers in our factory had just come from rural areas and cotton textile factories, and most of the engineering and technical personnel were young students who had just graduated from school. They were all laymen in flax textile. Thanks to the patient teaching of Soviet experts and the earnest study and active research of the entire factory's employees, they were able to quickly master flax textile technology and advanced operation methods.
    Establishing a normal production order was an important task in the initial stage of production. With the help of experts, we established a production labor organization. According to the experts' suggestions, we determined the supervision quota and labor quota for each workshop according to the work procedures and types of work, and widely implemented the piece-rate wage system and the time-based bonus system, thereby stimulating the workers' enthusiasm for production and improving labor productivity. With the increase in production, it is required that the various tasks of the enterprise be organized more accurately, and the cooperation of various departments be more coordinated. Under this new situation, the experts helped us improve the compilation of plans and promoted the operation plan system, which passed the production plan down to each worker, so that all cadres and workers had clear goals to strive for.
    When the production order was gradually normalized and the enthusiasm of the employees for production was further improved, it was required to strengthen specific leadership work. For this reason, Soviet experts helped us establish a production scheduling meeting system and an inspection system. We have insisted on implementing these two systems for several years, and we have deeply realized that this is one of the effective measures for the leadership to overcome bureaucracy and subjectivism.
    Poor product quality was an important difficulty we encountered in the early stage of production. With the help of experts, the technical inspection institutions of each sub-factory were improved, a technical inspection system for the technological process was established, and the responsibilities of leaders at all levels of production were clarified. After the Soviet government learned about the problems in the quality of our factory's products, it immediately sent chemical experts from the Soviet Union to us. With his help and guidance, a central laboratory was established, chemical analysis and research work was carried out, and a bleaching process plan suitable for Chinese linen cloth was formulated. As a result, the quality of the product has been significantly improved.
    It is because of the sincere assistance given to us by the Soviet people that we have established our own flax textile industry and enabled our factory to develop rapidly in the short five years since its establishment. It was officially put into production on National Day in 1952, and officially began to implement the national plan in 1953. Now the total output value has increased to 2.7 times that of 1953, and the total output is 2.9 times that of 1953, not only far exceeding the original design level, but also reaching the five-year plan level one year, seven months and ten days ahead of schedule—in May of last year. At the same time, other technical and economic indicators have also been greatly improved.
    In the past five years since the establishment of the factory, these excellent achievements under the leadership of the Party and the enthusiastic help of Soviet experts are further inspiring all the employees of our factory to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and learn from the spirit of hard work and thrift in building the country of the Soviet people.
    On the eve of the great 40th anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution, I would like to express my heartfelt thanks on behalf of all the employees of the factory to the Soviet people and the Soviet experts who have helped us in our work, and wish them more brilliant achievements in the great cause of building communism.

    真诚的友谊
    哈尔滨亚麻纺织厂厂长　郭霁云
    十月社会主义革命四十周年即将到来，在这些难忘的日子里，苏联专家亲切的形像又一次出现在我们的眼前，好像那还是昨天的事。
    富饶的松花江畔盛产着亚麻，但在日本帝国主义者统治东北时期，这却成了东北人民的心酸事，用自己的血汗种植的亚麻不能自己使用，却被日本帝国主义者掠夺一空，运往日本作为纺织原料，光复前，仅有的一个小型的亚麻纺织厂也全部被毁。光复后，大量亚麻纤维积压在麻农手中，因而亚麻纺织厂的建立对有效利用这一丰富资源、保证麻农生产和供应人民生活需要，就具有重要的意义。
    筹建哈尔滨亚麻纺织厂还是开国之前的事。当时，我们既没有亚麻纺织技术人员，更没有组织大规模生产的经验。就在这样困难重重的情况下，苏联人民伸出了友谊之手，对建厂工作给予了全面无私的援助。因此，哈尔滨亚麻纺织厂就成了我国大规模经济建设的前奏，也是苏联人民帮助我国建设最早的工厂。
    在建厂过程中，从勘察、设计、施工、安装到开工生产，都是在苏联专家的亲切帮助下进行的。远在1949年夏天，苏联政府给我们派来了设计专家，经过约三个月的勘测调查，完成了初步设计，确定了原料、生产能力、品种、厂址等问题。在这期间，为了了解亚麻原料的种植情况、原料加工情况及纤维质量等，专家冒着炎热的天气亲赴原料产地进行实地调查，为了确定纤维纺纱性能，并曾送部分亚麻纤维到苏联去试验，经过这一系列的工作，最后确定了工厂设计方案。苏联工人则在计划外为我们制造了最新的亚麻纺织设备，这些生产设备都是集中了当时苏联亚麻纺织工业中的最新技术成就制成的。这些设备很多都是苏联机器制造厂的第一、二、三号产品。如钢领式亚麻湿纺机、漂白联合机、染色联合机等在苏联也是才开始使用。据说，我们厂的织布机还是苏联设计师们根据我国工人身材较矮的特点特别设计的，由此可见苏联对我国援助是多么真诚和细致。
    在建场和生产过程中，苏联专家热情地教导和传授给了我们许多宝贵的先进经验，使我们节约了许多资金，加快了工程进度并保证了工程质量。如在专家的指导下，我们厂首先实施了冬季施工和工厂化施工方法，在我国建筑史上第一次试制成功泡沫混凝土和耐火地板。在这期间，苏联专家还帮助我们培养了大批技术力量。我们厂的工人都是刚从农村和棉纺织厂来的，工程技术人员大部分都是刚从学校毕业的年轻学生，对亚麻纺织都是外行，由于苏联专家耐心的教导和全厂职工的认真学习积极钻研，使他们能够较快地掌握亚麻纺织技术和先进操作法。
    建立正常生产秩序是开工生产初期的重要工作，我们在专家的帮助下，建立了生产劳动组织，根据专家的建议在全厂各车间按工序按工种确定了看管定额和劳动定员，广泛实行了计件工资制度和计时奖励制度，从而刺激了工人生产积极性，提高了劳动生产率。随着生产的提高，就要求企业各项工作组织得更加准确，各部门的配合更加协调，在这一新的情况下，专家帮助我们改进了计划的编制，推行了作业计划制度，把生产计划逐级下达到每个工人，使全体干部和工人都有了明确的奋斗目标。
    在生产秩序逐步正常，职工群众生产积极性进一步提高的时候，就要求加强具体的领导工作。为此苏联专家又帮助我们建立了生产调度会议制度和巡视检查制度，这两项制度，几年来，我们都坚持贯彻了，使我们深刻体会到这是领导上克服官僚主义主观主义的有效措施之一。
    产品质量不高是我们厂开工生产初期碰到的重要困难。在专家帮助下，健全了各分场的技术检查机构，建立了工艺过程的技术检查制度，明确了各级生产领导者的责任。苏联政府了解到我厂产品质量上的问题后，即从苏联给我们派来了化学专家，在他的帮助和指导下，建立了中央化验室，开展了化验研究工作，制订了适合于中国亚麻布的漂白加工工艺过程计划。从而使产品质量有了显著提高。
    由于苏联人民所给予我们的真诚的援助，才使我们建立了自己的亚麻纺织工业，并使我们厂在建厂以来的短短五年中有了飞速发展。从1952年国庆节正式投入生产，1953年开始正式执行国家计划。现在总产值已增长为1953年的二点七倍，总产量为二点九倍，不仅远远超过了原设计水平，并提前一年七个月零十一天——在去年5月份提前达到了五年计划水平。同时，其他各项技术经济指标也有了很大的提高。
    建厂五年来，在党的领导和苏联专家的热情帮助下所取得的这些优良成绩，正在进一步鼓舞着我们全厂职工学习苏联先进经验，学习苏联人民艰苦奋斗、勤俭建国的精神。
    值此伟大的十月社会主义革命四十周年的前夕，我谨代表全厂职工向苏联人民和帮助我们工作过的苏联专家表示衷心的感谢，并祝他们在建设共产主义的宏伟事业中取得更光辉的成就。
