　　Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 2nd - The Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, in accordance with the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, has adopted the method of launching from top to bottom, and rapidly launched a high tide of production movement centered on water conservancy construction and mass fertilizer accumulation throughout the province.

　　After the Third Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China immediately convened a meeting of prefectural committee secretaries in Beijing. Tan Zhenlin, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, personally attended the meeting and gave important instructions. The meeting focused on studying the organization of a great leap forward in agricultural production and the development of water conservancy and fertilizer accumulation movements this winter and next spring. The meeting decided that by 1962, the province's total grain output would increase from 20 billion catties this year to 30 billion catties, and next year it would reach 22 billion catties; the total cotton output would reach 1 billion catties, and next year it would reach 700 million catties. It was also clearly proposed that the irrigated area be expanded by 8 million to 10 million mu before next autumn (mainly this winter and next spring); and that the average fertilizer application per mu be above 5,000 catties.

　　After the meeting of prefectural committee secretaries, the local prefectural committees immediately convened meetings of prefectural and county committees to convey and deploy tasks.

　　From the 21st to the 29th, the Hebei Provincial Committee held its Fourth Plenary Session (enlarged) to convey the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party. During the meeting, the First Secretary of the Hebei Provincial Committee and Governor Lin Tie and other major leaders went to various places to inspect and help carry out the production movement. According to the situation after the initial mobilization of the masses in Tianjin, Cangxian and other regions, the production increase targets proposed by the townships and cooperatives greatly exceeded the targets set by the counties, regions and the province. The Provincial Committee emphasized that it is necessary to sufficiently estimate this situation, otherwise the leadership will lag behind the masses. Therefore, it is required that Party committees at all levels postpone matters that can be postponed and concentrate manpower, materials and financial resources to organize a great leap forward in agricultural production.

　　In the two years since Hebei Province achieved agricultural cooperativization, it has fully demonstrated that cooperativization provides a fully achievable condition for a great leap forward in agricultural production. This year, the grain yield per mu in 26 counties and suburban districts of Hebei Province has reached more than 286 catties. Among them, 13 counties and cities have a yield of more than 300 catties per mu; 10 counties and cities have more than 400 catties. According to statistics based on cooperatives, 3,104 cooperatives have an average yield of more than 400 catties per mu. These advanced cooperatives are distributed in various mountainous, plain, and low-lying areas, grain-producing areas, cotton-producing areas, and even areas with historically low yields.

　　At present, the water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation movement in Hebei Province this winter and next spring is in the process of formulating specific plans and starting actions in various places. Tangshan Prefecture proposed "Secretaries take action, the whole Party runs water conservancy," and decided that the prefectural committee secretary, commissioner, director of the prefectural committee's rural work department, and the organization minister, as well as the county committee secretaries and even the township Party committee secretaries and village branch secretaries, should each personally do a good job in a key water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation movement, summarize experience, and guide and promote the development of the movement. Tianjin Prefecture, in the tense situation of autumn harvest, autumn plowing, and wheat watering, dispatched 140,000 people to carry out water conservancy construction. According to statistics from only eight counties including Baodi and Renqiu, more than 2.4 million cubic meters of earthwork have been completed in half a month. The water conservancy construction movement in Cangxian Prefecture has entered a climax, with 510,000 people engaged in the water conservancy construction movement.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 2nd - Farmers in Hebei Province are enthusiastically investing and raising materials themselves to build water conservancy projects.

　　Many agricultural cooperatives in Handan Prefecture appropriately expanded the proportion of public accumulation funds retained during the autumn harvest distribution period to increase investment in water conservancy construction. After 80 agricultural cooperatives in Yongnian County appropriately increased the retention ratio of public accumulation funds, the amount of public accumulation funds reached more than 5 million yuan. In Huanghua, Mencun and other four counties in Cangxian Prefecture, the people's investment in water conservancy construction has exceeded 4.8 million yuan. In the Dongfanghong Agricultural Cooperative in Shenxian County, out of 618 households, 587 households automatically saved pocket money to invest in water conservancy. Cangxian County has a large task of building culverts and diverting water to wash alkali along the Nan Canal, which requires a large amount of investment. The farmers in this county put forward the slogan "Those who have labor contribute labor, those who have materials contribute materials, and those who have money contribute money," and quickly launched a mass upsurge of enthusiastic investment in water conservancy construction. In Tianjin Prefecture, the materials raised by the masses themselves for water conservancy construction include more than 3.2 million bricks and more than 6,000 tons of sand, stone, cement, etc. In Fucheng, Gucheng and other four counties in Cangxian Prefecture, the masses have already raised more than 15,000 original logs, more than 3,100 cubic meters of wood boards, and 5,800 tools, etc., which have solved the shortage of materials. Since mid-September, dozens of agricultural cooperative carts in Baodi County have traveled more than a hundred miles every day to transport stones and sand for water conservancy projects. In the Jiadaowa area of ​​Wuqing County, many farmers, in order to raise materials themselves for water conservancy, have temporarily postponed their housing construction plans and first used the materials for water conservancy projects.

　　Localities have also made great achievements in solving the problem of insufficient technical strength on their own. From the beginning of October to now, the ten prefectures in the province have generally adopted the method of learning while organizing forces, designing while constructing, and have trained and are training a total of more than 16,800 water conservancy construction technicians. In Cangxian Prefecture, the local areas use the construction site as a classroom and engineering technology as teaching materials, and have trained more than 2,500 technicians. Of the more than 180 channel lines that should be surveyed in this county, more than 140 have been surveyed by newly trained surveying technicians. In Xianxian County, 18 villages jointly established three cone-well technical guidance stations to help 36 educated youths learn cone-well technology in a short period of time.

    上下一齐发动兴修水利大量积肥
    河北全力组织农业生产大跃进
    有人出人，有物出物，有钱出钱，农民踊跃投资
    新华社保定2日电　中共河北省委员会根据党的八届三中全会精神，采取上下一齐发动的办法，在全省范围内迅速展开了以兴修水利、大量积肥为中心的生产运动高潮。
    党的八届三中全会以后，中共河北省委立即在北京市召开了地委书记会议，中共中央书记处书记谭震林亲自到会作了重要指示。会议着重研究了组织农业生产大跃进和今冬明春开展水利积肥运动的问题。会议决定到1962年全省粮食总产量从今年的二百亿斤达到三百亿斤，明年达到二百二十亿斤；棉花总产量达到十亿斤，明年达到七亿斤。并且明确提出：在明年秋前（主要在今冬明春）扩大水利灌溉面积八百万到一千万亩；每亩施肥平均在五千斤以上。
    地委书记会议以后，各地委立即召开地委、县委会议，传达和布置任务。
    河北省委于21日至29日又举行了第四次全体委员会议（扩大），传达党的八届三中全会精神。会议期间，河北省委第一书记、省长林铁等几位主要领导人，分头到各地检查和帮助开展生产运动。根据天津、沧县等专区初步发动群众后的情况，各乡、社所提出的增产指标，大大超过县、专区、省所规定的指标。省委强调指出：要足够估计这种形势，不然领导就要落在群众的后面。因此，要求各级党委把可以推迟的事情推迟一下，集中人力、物力、财力组织农业生产大跃进。
    河北省实现农业合作化两年来，充分显示合作化对农业生产大跃进提供了完全可能实现的条件。今年河北省已有二十六个县和市郊区粮食每亩产量已达到二百八十六斤以上。其中亩产三百斤以上的十三个县、市；四百斤以上的十个县、市。以社为单位统计，有三千一百零四个社平均产亩四百斤以上。这些先进的社，分布在各山区、平原、低洼地区，粮区、棉区甚至历年产量很低的地区。
    目前，河北省今冬明春的兴修水利和积肥运动，已在各地一面订具体计划，一面开始行动。唐山专区提出“书记动手，全党办水利事业”，决定地委书记、专员、地委农村工作部长和组织部长、各县委书记直到乡党委书记、村支部书记，每人亲手搞好一个水利建设和积肥运动的重点，总结经验，指导和推动运动的开展。天津专区在秋收秋耕和浇麦的紧张情况下，出动了十四万人开展兴修水利建设，仅宝坻、任丘等八个县的统计，半月来已完成土方二百四十多万公方。沧县专区的水利建设运动已进入高潮，五十一万人投入了水利建设运动。
    新华社保定2日电　河北省农民踊跃投资和自筹物料兴修水利。
    邯郸专区许多农业社在秋收分配期间，适当扩大了所留公积金的比例，增加水利建设投资。永年县的八十个农业社适当提高公积金的扣留比例后，公积金额达五百多万元。沧县专区的黄骅、孟村等四个县，群众兴修水利的投资已有四百八十多万元。深县东方红农业社六百一十八户社员，就有五百八十七户社员自动节约零用钱投资兴办水利。沧县在南运河沿岸修建涵闸和引水洗碱的任务较大，需要投资较多，这个县的农民提出“有人的出人，有物的出物，有钱的出钱”的口号，迅速掀起了群众踊跃投资兴建水利的热潮。天津专区各县群众自筹的兴修水利物料，已有砖三百二十多万块，沙、石、水泥等六千多吨。沧县专区阜城、故城等四个县，群众已经自筹原木一万五千多根、木板三千一百多方，工具五千八百件等，解决了物料不足的困难。宝坻县从9月中旬以来，每天有数十辆农业社的大车，远到百里以外运石头和沙子，用来兴修水利工程。武清县夹道洼地区的很多农民，为了自筹物料搞水利，把自己的盖房计划暂时推迟，先把物料用来兴修水利工程。
    各地在自行解决技术力量不足的问题上也作出了很大的成绩。从10月初到现在，全省十个专区一般采用边学习、边组织力量、边设计、边施工的办法，已经和正在训练的水利建设技术人员，共有一万六千八百多名。沧县专区各地以工地为课堂、以工程技术为教学材料，已经训练出二千五百多名技术人员。这个县应测的渠道线路有一百八十多条，现已由新训练的勘测技术员测完了一百四十多条。献县有十八个村联合成立了三个锥井技术辅导站，帮助三十六名知识青年在短时间内学会了锥井技术。
