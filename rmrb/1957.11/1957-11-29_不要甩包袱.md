Don't Shirk Responsibilities
			Mu Chao
    Currently, many government agencies and enterprises are streamlining their organizations and transferring cadres to lower levels. Most agencies are genuinely streamlining and sending cadres who need practical training to the countryside. This will not only transform and elevate the thinking of these transferred cadres but also add a group of educated laborers to the countryside, accelerating the development of agricultural production.

    However, some government agencies and enterprises are not doing this. Instead, they are taking the opportunity to "transfer" cadres they consider to be a "burden." On the surface, it seems like they are also sending these cadres down for "training," but in reality, they are truly shrugging them off like "burdens."

    For example, among the female cadres transferred from the Beijing No. 2 Machine Tool Factory to Majiabao Township, eight were mothers with nursing infants, and one was seven or eight months pregnant. After these people were sent to the countryside, they found it difficult to participate in labor due to the burden of their children. On the contrary, the agricultural cooperative had to spare effort to care for them.

    Another example: according to the Beijing Nan苑 District Committee, among the cadres transferred to various townships in the district, 127 were long-term patients, and 29 were elderly and infirm, unable to work. For example, among the 159 cadres transferred from the Capital Construction Bureau of the Ministry of Electric Power Industry to Guangdezhuang, 15 suffered from pulmonary tuberculosis, and one was coughing up blood; in addition, there were three elderly people over the age of 50 who were completely unable to participate in production.

    The above-mentioned incorrect practices have been inspected and are being corrected by relevant departments in Beijing. However, there are still some similar government agencies and enterprises in other places. Although their specific situations vary, they are largely the same in terms of "shirking responsibilities." For these government agencies and enterprises, this approach can indeed achieve the effect of "streamlining the organization." However, a comprehensive examination raises doubts about this "effect." Taking the two examples above, while the "organization" of the unit has indeed been "streamlined," the number of non-productive personnel in the Majiabao Agricultural Cooperative and the Red Star Collective Farm has greatly increased. This is not genuine streamlining of the organization, nor is it genuine transfer of cadres for training. The appropriate term is to transfer those they consider to be "burdens" to the agricultural cooperatives.

    In fact, these female cadres burdened with children or elderly cadres should not be regarded as "burdens." Although they cannot participate in agricultural production now, some can do other work, and some can participate in household labor. Currently, the streamlining of organizations and the transfer of cadres are continuing. We must implement the principle of proper arrangements and take responsibility to the end, and we must never adopt an attitude of "shrugging" them off.

    不要甩包袱	穆迢
    现在，许多机关企业都在紧缩机构、下放干部。多数的机关真正地紧缩了机构，把一些需要在劳动中受锻炼的干部下放到农村中去。这样，不仅这些下放干部的思想会得到改造和提高，而且，也会给农村里增加一批有文化的劳动力，更快地促进农业生产的发展。
    可是，有的机关企业却不是这样，而是将一些自认为是“包袱”的干部趁机“下放”，表面上好像也是让这些干部下去“锻炼”，实际上却真的是像“包袱”一样地将他们甩出去。
    比如：北京市第二机床厂下放到马家堡乡的女干部中，有八个人都带着吃奶的孩子，有一个人是怀孩子七、八个月的孕妇。这些人下放到农村以后，由于孩子的牵累，很难参加劳动。相反的，农业社还要分心来关照她们。
    再比如：据北京南苑区委了解，在下放到这个区各乡的干部中，有长期病号一百二十七人，年老体衰不能劳动的二十九人。如电力工业部基建局下放到广德庄的一百五十九名干部中，患肺结核者十五人，有一人还在大口吐血；另外，还有三个五十岁以上的老年人，根本不能参加生产。
    上述这些不正确的做法，已经北京市有关机关检查并且开始纠正，但是其他地方类似的机关、企业还有一些，他们的具体情况虽然各有差别，但在“甩包袱”这一点上，却是大同小异。这些机关、企业的这种做法，对他本身说来，确实可以收到“紧缩机构”之效。可是，从全面来考查一下，对于这个“效”就不能不有所怀疑了。就拿上面所举两个例子来看，固然，本单位的“机构”真的是“紧缩”了，可是，马家堡农业社和红星集体农庄的非生产人员却大大地增加了。这不是真正的紧缩机构，更不是真正的下放干部去锻炼，恰当的说法，就是将自己认为是“包袱”的人转嫁到农业社身上。
    其实，对于这些有孩子拖累的女干部或者年老的干部，绝不能看作是“包袱”。他们现在虽然不能参加农业生产，但有的可以做别的工作，有的可以参加家务劳动。现在，紧缩机构、下放干部正在继续进行，必须贯彻妥善安排、负责到底的方针，一定不要采取“甩”出去的态度。
