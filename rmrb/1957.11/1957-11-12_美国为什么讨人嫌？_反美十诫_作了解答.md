Xinhua News Agency, 11th Dispatch: Why is America so unpopular? Why has anti-American sentiment arisen all over the world? An article in the American weekly "The Nation" on October 12, "Ten Commandments of Anti-Americanism," provides an answer to this question.

The article, written by Geoffrey Barraclough, Professor of World History at the University of London, states that American and Western European "experts" recently held a conference in Bruges, Belgium, to discuss various issues concerning the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. At this conference, the European-American Association Congress presented a "relatively comprehensive" report, pointing out the following ten roots of anti-American thought:

(1) In the eyes of Europeans, Washington's foreign policy is incomprehensible. America's fickle and incoherent policies cannot inspire trust and respect.

(2) Europeans rarely believe that the U.S. government genuinely desires peace. Many believe that if it weren't for the United States' policy of spreading distrust towards all people who hold different views, Western Europe might have been able to find a way to coexist peacefully with other people in the world—including communists.

(3) The United States claims to be the defender of freedom, but Europeans cannot help but notice that in the United States, those who genuinely believe in communism are persecuted.

(4) People widely suspect that America's foreign aid programs are a manifestation of economic imperialism.

(5) The United States criticizes colonialism and claims to advocate for the elimination of racial discrimination. However, in the eyes of Europeans, the United States' domestic handling of racial issues violates these principles.

(6) Instead of facing reality, the United States supports the puppet government of China. However, everyone knows that Chiang Kai-shek can never undo what the Chinese Communist Party has done. Europeans do not understand why the United States opposes China's entry into the United Nations.

(7) By antagonizing every national bloc in the world that is unwilling to unconditionally support American policy, the U.S. government's attitude can only lead to a third world war.

(8) American movies, novels, radio, television, etc., present an image of America to Europeans that cannot inspire trust and admiration.

(9) The American civilization that people see in reality is very unattractive. What Europeans see in reality is a scene of people being turned into objects in the pursuit of profit.

(10) In order to sell more products, the United States spares no effort to break down European barriers, but its own borders are closed to European goods. Europe needs more trade, not more "aid."

In addition, the author also said that at this conference, an American of German descent with international renown pointed out that the United States' interference in the internal affairs of European countries, especially its interference in elections, has caused extremely harmful consequences. This point is also "very illuminating" as to why there is anti-American sentiment.

### 美国为什么讨人嫌？  “反美十诫”作了解答

    美国为什么讨人嫌？
    “反美十诫”作了解答
    新华社11日讯　美国为什么这样不得人心？为什么在全世界都发生了反美的情绪？10月12日的美国“民族”周刊发表的一篇文章“反美十诫”对这个问题作了一个解答。
    由伦敦大学世界史教授乔弗里·巴拉克劳写的这篇文章说，美国和西欧的“专家”不久前在比利时布鲁治斯举行了一次会议来讨论北大西洋集团的各种问题。在这次会议上，欧美协会大会提出了一个“比较全面”的报告，指出了反美思想的下述十点根源：
    （一）在欧洲人的眼里，华盛顿的外交政策是不可理解的。美国的善变的、不连贯的政策，不能激起人们的信任和尊敬。
    （二）欧洲人很少相信美国政府真正要求和平。很多的人认为，要不是因为美国实行散布对所有持不同看法的人民的不信任的政策的话，西欧本来是可能找到与世界上其他的人——其中包括共产党人——和平共处的方法的。
    （三）美国自称是自由的捍卫者，但是欧洲人不能不注意到：在美国，真正信仰共产主义的人是受到迫害的。
    （四）人们广泛疑心美国的援外计划是经济帝国主义政策的表现。
    （五）美国指责殖民主义，并且自称主张取消种族歧视。但是，欧洲人看来，美国国内对种族问题的处理就违背了这些原则。
    （六）美国不面对现实，反而支持中国的傀儡政府。然而，人人都清楚，蒋介石永远也取消不了中国共产党所做的一切。欧洲人不了解美国为什么反对让中国进入联合国。
    （七）由于同世界上各个不愿意无条件支持美国政策的国家集团作对，美国政府的态度只能导致第三次世界大战。
    （八）美国的电影、小说、无线电、电视等等使欧洲人看到的美国不能激发人们的信任和敬仰。
    （九）人们从实际中看到的美国的文明是很不吸引人的。欧洲人从实际中所看到的是为了追逐利润把人变成物体的景象。
    （十）美国为了多推销产品，不遗余力要打破欧洲的壁垒，但是他自己的边界对欧洲的货物却是关闭的。欧洲需要的是更多的贸易，而不是更多的“援助”。
    此外，作者还说，在这次会议上，一个孚有国际声望的德国血统的美国人指出，美国对欧洲国家内政的干涉，特别是对选举的干涉，造成了极其有害的恶果。对于为什么会有反美情绪，这一点也是“很可以说明问题”的。
