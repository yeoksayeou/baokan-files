    Six Korean grain seeds propagate into over one thousand jin
    Six large Korean grain seeds, after being carefully cultivated by the Dangyang Advanced Cooperative of Dangwu Township, Guizhu County, Guizhou Province, have been transformed into 1,128 jin in four years.
    These six Korean grain seeds were brought back from Korea in 1954 by a demobilized volunteer soldier. They were planted that year, and the second year yielded one jin; after four years of cultivation, they became over one thousand jin. This kind of Korean grain has seeds that are more than twice the size of local grain varieties, and the yield is also relatively high. This year, the Dangyang Cooperative harvested 5% more per mu by planting this grain compared to local varieties. If more fertilizer is applied and deep plowing and meticulous cultivation are carried out, the increase in production will be even greater. The cooperative is now preparing to select three jin of seeds for the Guizhou Provincial Agricultural Experiment Station for use as specimens and for experimental research. (Xiao Kai)

    六粒朝鲜谷种繁殖一千多斤
    六粒又长又大的朝鲜谷种，经过贵州省贵筑县党武乡当阳高级社细心地栽培，四年中变成了一千一百二十八市斤。
    这六粒朝鲜谷种是1954年由复员的志愿军从朝鲜带来的，当年种下去，第二年收得一斤；培植四年，就成了一千多斤。这种朝鲜谷，籽粒比本地谷大一倍多，产量也比较高。当阳社今年种这种谷比本地品种每亩多收5％，如果多施肥，深耕细作，增产还要多。现在社里准备选三斤种给贵州省农业试验站，作标本和试验研究之用。	（晓凯）
