Xinhua News Agency, New York, November 12th (TASS dispatch): The achievements of Soviet science and technology, as demonstrated by the launching of artificial satellites, continue to spark enthusiastic commentary from American politicians and newspapers.

    The spokesmen for American monopoly organizations are trying to use this opportunity to incite war mania, increase taxes on working people, and intensify the arms race.

    Finletter, a lawyer who served as Secretary of the Air Force in the Truman administration, delivered a television speech a few days ago demanding that the United States vigorously strengthen its rocket weapons program, even if this inevitably leads to increased taxes.

    “Daily News” reporter O'Donnell said that the leaders of the Democratic and Republican parties in Congress believe that “income taxes will have to be increased” because the Soviet Union “has greatly surpassed the United States in some areas where we used to think the United States had absolute superiority.”

    However, this proposition has been opposed by some American newspapers. Some American newspapers and politicians believe that it is necessary to reconsider America’s "position of strength" policy and "Cold War" policy, which are not in line with the current international situation.

    “New York Post” reporter Childs wrote that influential members of Congress “are beginning to conclude that Eisenhower-Dulles foreign policy will not achieve its goals.”

    He went on to say that Democratic members of Congress feel that Dulles’ views are “incorrect” because Dulles wants to negotiate with the Soviet Union from a "position of strength."

    Childs concluded by saying, "Recent events have shown that the position of strength policy insisted upon by the Secretary of State has become outdated in the last five years."

    Former U.S. Secretary of Defense Wilson told "New York Post" reporter Wallace that it is now necessary to relax the "Cold War" and "ease global tensions." "We cannot live in fear forever; this is a very dangerous thing."

    U.S. business tycoon Eaton published an article in the "New York Herald Tribune," emphasizing that an arms race is "meaningless" now that the Soviet Union has mastered modern weapons.

    Eaton said he is a "man loyal to capitalism," but he believes that a "common ground" must be found between the United States and the Soviet Union. He warned that the surest way to destroy American capitalism "is to go to war with Russia."

    The "Chicago Daily News" recently published an article signed by the newspaper's president and publisher, John Knight, entitled: "Dulles Should Resign." The article said that the kind of diplomacy that Dulles is pursuing, coupled with intimidation, bluster, and abuse, is long out of date.

    Keith Beach, the foreign affairs commentator for the "Chicago Daily News," also wrote an article saying: "The first satellite and the second satellite show that Dulles is standing on shaky ground. Dulles should resign."

### 红色月亮照耀下  美国政界七嘴八舌  有人想煽起战争狂　有人叫杜勒斯下台

    红色月亮照耀下
    美国政界七嘴八舌
    有人想煽起战争狂　有人叫杜勒斯下台
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯据塔斯社纽约12日讯：由发射人造卫星显示出的苏联科学技术的成就，继续引起美国政界人士和报纸的热烈评论。
    美国垄断组织的代言人力图利用这个机会来煽起战争狂，增加对劳动人民的捐税，加紧军备竞赛。
    曾经在杜鲁门政府担任空军部长的芬勒特律师前几天发表了电视演说，要求美国大力加强火箭武器方面的计划，即使这种做法必然要增加捐税。
    纽约“每日新闻”记者奥当纳说，国会中民主党和共和党的领袖们认为，由于苏联“在我们过去认为美国占绝对优势的一些部门都大大地超过了美国”，“所得税还要加重”。
    但是，这种主张遭到了美国一些报纸的反对。美国的有些报纸和政界人士认为有必要重新考虑美国的不符合当前国际局势要求的“实力地位”政策和
  “冷战”政策。
    “纽约邮报”记者蔡尔兹写道，有影响的议员“开始得出结论：艾森豪威尔——杜勒斯的外交政策不会达到目的”。
    他接着说，民主党议员觉得杜勒斯的观点“不对头”，因为杜勒斯要以“实力地位”同苏联进行谈判。
    蔡尔兹最后说，“不久前发生的事件说明，国务卿坚持的实力地位政策在最近五年内已经过时了”。
    前任美国国防部长威尔逊对“纽约邮报”记者华莱斯说，目前必须放松
  “冷战”和“缓和全世界的紧张气氛”，
  “不能永远在恐惧中生活，这是非常危险的事情”。
    美国大企业家以顿在“纽约先驱论坛报”上发表了一篇文章，他着重指出，在苏联已经掌握了现代武器的时候，军备竞赛是“毫无意义的”。
    以顿说他是一个“忠实于资本主义的人”，但是他认为，在美国同苏联之间必须“找出一个共同的基础”。他警告说，消灭美国资本主义最可靠的办法
  “就是同俄国作战”。
    “芝加哥每日新闻”最近刊载了一篇由这个报社的社长和发行人约翰·奈特署名的文章，题目是：“杜勒斯应该下台”。文章说，杜勒斯所执行的那种外交，再加上恫吓、叫嚣和谩骂，这早已过时了。
    “芝加哥每日新闻”的外交评论员凯斯·比奇也写文章说：“第一个卫星和第二个卫星说明：杜勒斯的脚根是站不稳的。杜勒斯应当下台。”
