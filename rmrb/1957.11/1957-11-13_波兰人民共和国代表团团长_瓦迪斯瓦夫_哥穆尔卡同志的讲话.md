Comrades, Deputies of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union!

Our delegation, on behalf of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, the Polish people, and the government of the Polish People's Republic, extends our heartfelt congratulations to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and the Soviet people on the 40th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution. (Applause)

The achievements of socialist construction made by the working class and the entire Soviet people over the past forty years with tremendous and selfless efforts are the common achievements of the international workers' movement and the common property of all progressive humanity. (Applause)

The transformative and constructive power of the October Revolution is manifested in two major aspects: first, the changes that have taken place in the Soviet Union in the past forty years; and second, the changes in the face of the world and the balance of world forces under the influence of the revolution.

Not only the Soviet Union, but all socialist countries, including Poland, are solemnly celebrating the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution.

Our country is especially grateful to the October Revolution in many ways, because this revolution shattered the chains of national enslavement imposed on the Polish people by the Tsar and the German Emperor, ended the partition of Poland, and enabled the Polish people to regain the right to independent existence for which they had struggled for about a century and a half. We must also thank the Soviet Union, which was established due to the victory of the October Revolution and has become a tremendous force, for enabling us to shake off the heavy yoke of Hitler's occupation and for saving the Polish people from the destruction that Hitler had prepared for them. The victory over fascist Germany, the victory of the Soviet Union, enabled Poland to recover its western territories. As a result of this victory, conditions were created for Poland to embark on the path of socialist construction.

Our two countries share hundreds of kilometers of common border, which, under socialism, has become a boundary of friendship and harmony.

Therefore, we Poles have special reasons to feel the greatness and significance of the October Revolution as deeply as you do, and to solemnly celebrate its 40th anniversary. (Applause)

The exchange of delegations between our two countries to participate in the celebrations of the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution will further strengthen the fraternal ties of friendship between Poland and the Soviet Union. (Applause)

The path that Poland and Russian revolutionaries have jointly traversed for decades; the common struggle of the Polish and Russian proletariat in 1905; the broad participation of Poles in the October Revolution; the establishment of Polish armed forces on Soviet soil during the war and their joint struggle alongside the Soviet army – all these most convincingly demonstrate how great and glorious traditions have linked the Polish working class and the Polish people with the Russian revolutionary movements and the Soviet people. (Applause)

The Polish people have been following the path that the Soviet people began forty years ago for only fourteen years. However, the ideas propagated, developed, and initiated by the great Lenin and the party he founded illuminate our path. Despite some unavoidable mistakes made by our party in such a great cause as building a new socialist social system, our country has still achieved significant successes in socialist construction.

These achievements were made, in no small part, thanks to the assistance we received from you in developing our industry.

Our party, the Polish United Workers' Party, is striving to carry out Poland's socialist construction in accordance with the basic principles of Leninism. We have implemented a series of beneficial changes in national life, in the work of the party, in the work of the people's government, and in the planning of our economy. The purpose of these changes is to strengthen socialism in Poland and to maintain better and closer ties between the party and the working class, the working people, and the entire nation. We are accomplishing the above tasks in the process of struggling against anti-socialist elements, revisionism, liquidationism, as well as dogmatism and sectarianism. The tenth plenary session of our Party Central Committee made a series of important decisions that will consolidate the unity of the party and strengthen its ability to lead the people.

We believe that the unity, mutual support, and solidarity of socialist countries with equal rights is a necessary condition for the further development of socialist construction in our country. This is first and foremost a necessary condition to prevent various imperialist blocs from realizing their war plans, and to victoriously carry out the struggle for peace and peaceful coexistence. The change in the world balance of forces brought about by the October Revolution has strengthened the forces of peace and increased the possibility of maintaining peace. The significant achievements of Soviet science and technology have provided the conditions to manufacture and launch the world's first few artificial earth satellites, thereby opening a new era in human history, promoting the great strengthening of socialism, and thereby promoting the strengthening of world peace forces.

The achievements of socialism make all peace-loving people rejoice, and make those who are obsessed with war, who attempt to stir up a new wave of the arms race, and who want to impose their will and rule on free people with thermonuclear weapons and killer rockets sigh and groan. The ever-growing strength of socialism is the most powerful guarantee to eliminate such evil schemes. This is now a very important sign of the role socialism plays in all mankind.

The Great October Socialist Revolution in Russia created the first socialist country in history – the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. It occupies the first place in the equal and large family of all socialist countries. Every one of your achievements and every one of your victories is also our achievement and the victory of the socialist ideals of a continuously prosperous humanity. (Applause)

Today, as we solemnly celebrate the 40th anniversary of this revolution, on behalf of the Polish delegation, the Polish workers, peasants, intellectuals, and the Polish people, I extend my heartfelt congratulations to the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and all the peoples of the Soviet Republics, and wish them new victories and achievements in their historical march towards communism.  (Applause)

Long live the 40th anniversary of the Great October

### 波兰人民共和国代表团团长  瓦迪斯瓦夫·哥穆尔卡同志的讲话

专栏：

    波兰人民共和国代表团团长
    瓦迪斯瓦夫·哥穆尔卡同志的讲话苏联最高苏维埃代表同志们！
    我们的代表团代表波兰统一工人党中央委员会、波兰人民和波兰人民共和国政府向苏联最高苏维埃、苏联共产党中央委员会和苏联人民衷心祝贺伟大的十月社会主义革命四十周年。（掌声）
    贵国工人阶级和全体苏联人民四十年来用巨大的忘我的努力取得的社会主义建设成就，是国际工人运动的共同成果，是全体进步人类的共同财产。（掌声）
    十月革命的改造力量和建设力量表现在两大方面：第一方面是，苏联在过去四十年中发生了变化，第二方面是，世界的面貌和世界力量的对比在革命的影响下发生了变化。
    不仅苏联，所有的社会主义国家，其中包括波兰，也都在隆重庆祝十月革命四十周年。
    我国特别要在许多方面感谢十月革命，因为这次革命打碎了沙皇和德皇套在波兰人民身上的民族奴役的锁链，结束了波兰被瓜分的状态，使波兰人民重新获得了他们为之奋斗约一个半世纪的独立生存的权利。我们之所以能摔掉了希特勒占领的沉重桎梏，波兰人民之所以不致遭到希特勒已为他们准备好的毁灭，也不得不感谢由于十月革命胜利而建立起来、并且已经成为一支巨大力量的苏联。对法西斯战争的胜利、苏联的胜利使波兰收复了西部领土。这次胜利的结果，创造了条件，使波兰有可能踏上社会主义建设的道路。
    我们两国有着数百公里的共同边界，这条边界在社会主义的条件下成了友好和睦的疆界。
    因此，我们波兰人有特别的理由同你们一样地深刻感到十月革命的伟大及其意义，并且隆重庆祝十月革命四十周年。（掌声）
    我们两国互派代表团到另一国去参加十月革命四十周年庆典，将更加密切波苏两国兄弟的友谊联系。（掌声）
    波兰同俄国的革命家在数十年的时间内共同走过的道路，波兰和俄国无产阶级1905年的共同斗争，波兰人广泛地参加十月革命，战争时期在苏联土地上建立了波兰军队并且同苏联军队并肩进行了斗争，这一切最令人信服地证明了，有多么伟大和光荣的传统把波兰工人阶级和波兰人民同俄国革命运动和苏联人民联结了起来。（掌声）
    波兰人民走苏联人民在四十年前开始走的道路才不过第十四年。但是，伟大的列宁和他缔造的党所传播、发展和开始实现的思想照耀着我们的道路。尽管我们的党犯了一些在实现建设新的社会主义社会制度这样一件伟大的事业中所难免的错误，但是我国在建设社会主义方面仍然获得了重大的成就。
    这些成就之所以获得，在不小的程度上是由于我国从你们这里得到了发展我们工业的援助。
    我们的党，波兰统一工人党，在竭力使波兰的社会主义建设按照列宁主义的基本原则进行。我们在国家生活中、党的工作中、人民政权的工作方面和我国经济的计划工作方面实行了一系列有益的变革。这些变革的目的是加强波兰的社会主义，使党同工人阶级、同劳动人民群众、同全国人民保持更好的、更紧密的联系。我们是在跟反社会主义分子、修正主义、取消派以及教条主义和宗派主义的倾向作斗争的过程中实现上述任务的。我们党中央第十次全体会议作出了一系列重要的决定，这些决定将能巩固党的团结，加强它领导人民的能力。
    我们认为权利平等的社会主义国家的一致、互相支持和团结是我国社会主义建设进一步发展的一个必需条件。这首先是阻止形形色色的帝国主义集团实现其战争计划的必需条件，是胜利进行争取和平与和平共处的斗争的必需条件。由于十月革命而产生的世界力量对比的变化加强了爱好和平的力量，增加了维护和平的可能性。苏联科学技术的重大成就提供了条件来制造和发射了世界上头几颗地球卫星，从而开辟了人类历史的新纪元，促进社会主义的大大加强，从而促进世界和平力量的加强。
    社会主义的成就使一切爱好和平的人欢欣鼓舞，使那些念念不忘战争、企图掀起军备竞赛的新浪潮和想用热核武器和杀人火箭把自己的意志和统治强加于自由的人民的人唉声叹气，不断增长的社会主义力量是消灭这种罪恶图谋的最有力的保障。现在这是社会主义在全人类中所起的作用的一个很重要的标志。
    俄国伟大的十月社会主义革命创造了历史上第一个社会主义国家——苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟。它在所有社会主义国家的平等的大家庭中占着第一位。你们的每一个成就和每一个胜利也就是我们的成就和不断繁荣的全人类的社会主义思想的胜利。（掌声）
    今天，当我们隆重庆祝这个革命的四十周年的时候，我代表波兰代表团，代表波兰的工人、农民、知识分子，代表波兰人民向苏联共产党和各苏维埃共和国全体人民表示衷心祝贺，祝他们在走向共产主义的历史进军中取得新的胜利和成绩。（掌声）
    伟大的十月社会主义革命四十周年万岁！
    所有社会主义国家，所有共产党和工人党的兄弟团结万岁！
    波苏两国人民的兄弟友谊万岁！
    和平和社会主义万岁！（经久不息的掌声）
