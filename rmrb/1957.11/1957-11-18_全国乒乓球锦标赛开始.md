    National Table Tennis Championships Begin
    (Our dispatch) The 1957 National Table Tennis Championships began on the 17th at the Beijing Gymnasium with the first day of competition – the men's and women's team events. A total of sixty teams participated in forty-four matches that day.
    In the men's group matches, Beijing Team 1, Guangdong Team 1, Shanghai Team 1, Heilongjiang Team, and others all achieved two wins out of two matches, easily defeating their opponents with overwhelming scores of 5-0 or 5-1. In the women's group matches, Beijing Team 1, Team 2, Guangdong Team 1, Guangxi Team, and others all demonstrated high levels of skill, often winning against their opponents with scores of 3-0 or 3-1.
    The match between Beijing Team 1 and Shanghai Team 1 in the women's Group 4 was a thrilling contest, which could be described as a battle for the group championship (as these two teams were the strongest in the group). Beijing Team 1 fielded Qiu Zhonghui, the national champion from last year, and Ye Peiqiong, the runner-up. Shanghai Team 1 countered with Zhu Peimin and Chi Huifang. In the first match between Qiu and Chi, Qiu Zhonghui, who had only recently resumed training due to a wrist injury, lost to Chi Huifang by a score of 2-0. In the second match between Ye and Zhu, Ye used her varied chopping technique to win by 2-0, leveling the score. In the third doubles match, Ye and Qiu achieved victory. Finally, in the match between Ye and Chi, Ye Peiqiong emerged victorious again, winning the match by a score of 3-1.
    The men's and women's team events in this championship will continue for six days. After the group champions are determined on the 21st, the finals for the championship title will be held.

    全国乒乓球锦标赛开始
    本报讯　1957年全国乒乓球锦标赛17日在北京体育馆开始进行第一天的比赛——男、女团体赛。这一天共有六十个队进行了四十四场的比赛。
    在男子组的比赛中，北京一队、广东一队、上海一队、黑龙江队等都是二战二胜，他们都是以五比零、五比一的压倒优势轻取对手。女子组的比赛中，北京一队、二队、广东一队、广西队等都表现了较高的水平，她们经常以三比零、三比一打赢对手。
    女子第四组北京一队对上海一队的比赛是一场动人心弦的比赛，也可以说是分组冠军的争夺赛（小组内以这两队为最强）。北京一队以去年全国冠、亚军丘钟惠、叶佩琼上场，上海一队以朱培民、池惠芳应战。第一盘丘、池的比赛，丘钟惠因手腕受伤，最近才开始练习，结果以二比零败于池惠芳。第二盘叶、朱之战，叶用变化多端的削球以二比零扳回一盘。第三盘双打中，叶、丘又取得了胜利。最后叶对池的比赛中，叶佩琼又告捷，以三比一取得了这场比赛的胜利。
    这次锦标赛中的男、女团体赛将连续进行六天的比赛，从21日起各分组冠军产生后，将进行争夺冠军的决赛。
