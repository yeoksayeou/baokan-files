    The Beautiful Scenery of Latvia

    Latvia lies on the picturesque Gulf of Riga on the Baltic Sea. The coast is lined with dense, ancient pine trees. This undulating land is dotted with emerald-like lakes and countless silvery rivers. These bays, rivers, and lakes bring endless wealth – fish – to the Latvian people. Fish-rich lakes account for 90% of the total lake area. By 1960, the Soviet Union's per capita fish consumption will be 11.1 kilograms, more than double that of the United States. The Latvian Republic plays a significant role in completing this massive task, and the Republic's fish production will increase 1.7 times during the Sixth Five-Year Plan.

    Latvia was a developed industrial and livestock region during the Tsarist era. However, during the twenty years when its people's government was suppressed and under bourgeois rule, industry declined sharply. Only after it joined the Soviet Union in 1940 did the economic situation fundamentally change. In the eleven years after the war, industrial output increased 6.7 times compared to 1940. Many large hydroelectric power stations were built. The machinery manufacturing industry has experienced even greater development.

    1949 was a turning point in Latvian agricultural history. Having defeated the kulak class, the Latvian farmers resolutely embarked on the path of collectivization. Now the republic has established 1,391 collective farms and 81 state-owned farms. Animal husbandry has also flourished. Its pastures account for a quarter of the country's land, and its milk and dairy products account for 4% of the total Soviet production, despite its small area. Dairy farming is the most developed sector in animal husbandry, with 41% of all agricultural cash income coming from dairy farming. Last year, Latvia's average milk production per capita was 520 kilograms, far exceeding that of the United States. In 1960, the output per 100 hectares of agricultural land will reach 700 quintals of milk and 100 quintals of meat.

    With economic development, Latvia has also achieved tremendous progress in cultural construction. Many collective farmers in rural areas have purchased radios and televisions. Now Latvia has fourteen times more libraries than in 1940, and thirteen times more clubs.

    Latvia's capital, Riga, is a large seaport and is not only Latvia's most important industrial and cultural center, but also the most important cultural center on the entire Baltic coast.

    景色美丽的拉脱维亚
    拉脱维亚在美丽如画的波罗的海的里加湾畔。沿岸一片浓密的苍松。在这块丘陵起伏的土地上，嵌着一块块翠绿如镜的湖泊和无数条银色的河川。这些海湾、河流和湖泊给拉脱维亚人民带来了无尽的财富——鱼。其中有丰富鱼产的湖泊就占湖泊总面积的90％。到1960年，苏联按人口计算的鱼的消费量将是十一点一公斤，要比美国多一倍以上。在完成这个巨大的任务中，拉脱维亚共和国起着重大的作用，第六个五年计划中，共和国的鱼产量将增加一点七倍。
    拉脱维亚在帝俄时代就是个工业和畜牧业发达的地方。但是在它的人民政权被扼杀、受资产阶级统治的二十年中，工业却急剧地衰落了。只有在1940年它加入苏联以后，经济情况才发生了根本变化。战后的十一年里，工业产量比1940年增加到六点七倍。许多大水电站建立了。机器制造业更是获得巨大的发展。
    1949年是拉脱维亚农业史上的转折点。战胜了富农阶级的拉脱维亚农民坚决地走上了集体化的道路。现在共和国已建立了一千三百九十一个集体农庄和八十一个国营农场。畜牧业更蓬蓬勃勃地发展起来了。它的牧场面积占全国土地四分之一，它出产的牛乳和乳制品占全苏联总产量的4％，虽然它的面积不大。在畜牧业中以牛乳业最发达，所有农产品现金收入的41％都是来自牛乳业。去年拉脱维亚按人口平均的牛奶产量是五百二十公斤，大大地超过了美国。1960年每一百公顷农业用地的产量将达到七百公担牛奶，一百公担肉类。
    随着经济的发展，拉脱维亚在文化建设上也获得了巨大的发展。农村许多集体农民购买了收音机和电视机。现在拉脱维亚的图书馆比1940年增加了十四倍，俱乐部增加了十三倍。
    拉脱维亚的首都里加是个巨大的海港，它不仅是拉脱维亚最重要的工业和文化中心，而且也是整个波罗的海沿岸最重要的文化中心。
