　　Opening up Sources of Fertilizer from All Sides, Conscientiously Solving Mutual Benefit Problems
　　Fangshan County's Accumulation of Fertilizer Increased Ninefold Compared with the Same Period Last Year; Qin Feng Cooperative Improved Fertilizer Accumulation Methods and Improved Fertilizer Quality
　　(Our Newspaper) News: Hebei Province's Fangshan County paid attention to implementing mutual benefit policies in the fertilizer accumulation campaign, which boosted the enthusiasm of the masses for accumulating fertilizer. At present, the county's fertilizer accumulation has increased more than ninefold compared with the same period last year.
　　Farmers in Fangshan County have found many sources of fertilizer. The main sources of fertilizer at present are using corn stalks, weeds, and fallen leaves for compaction; using livestock sheds, toilets, etc., to make fertilizer; in addition, there are also exchanging soil bricks for heated brick beds, smoke fertilization, sweeping streets, building public toilets, picking up manure, and so on. The county has about 100 million catties of corn stalks. In addition to leaving some for fuel and feed, there are still 50 million catties that can be used for compaction. Currently, more than 27 million catties of chopped stalks have been compacted for fertilizer. Tiangezhuang Agricultural Cooperative in Xiacun Township put forward the slogan "Men, women, old and young, all get to work, piles of fertilizer everywhere," while publicizing, looking for sources of fertilizer, and accumulating fertilizer.
　　In dealing with the fertilizer accumulated by members, agricultural cooperatives in various places have fully paid attention to the principle of mutual benefit by pricing according to quality, which has greatly boosted the enthusiasm of members for accumulating fertilizer. Many cooperatives have formulated or revised methods for fertilizer accumulation remuneration and rewards and punishments. For example, the Daciluo Agricultural Cooperative stipulates fertilizer accumulation tasks for each person within the production team, awarding work points based on fixed quality and quantity, and giving rewards for exceeding the quota. The specific method is: dividing the quality of accumulated fertilizer into three grades: A, B, and C, and giving different prices, and stipulating that the C-grade fertilizer in the fertilizer accumulated by each person cannot exceed 15%. For the part exceeding the task of accumulating fertilizer, two more work points are added per "cubic meter." This method has played a great role in stimulating and urging members to actively accumulate fertilizer.
　　As of November 20, the whole county of Fangshan had accumulated more than 995 million catties of finished and semi-finished fertilizer. According to the average of 220,000 mu of spring-sown land in the county, each mu has 4,300 catties of fertilizer. Compared with the same period last year, the amount of fertilizer accumulated has increased more than ninefold. The fertilizer accumulation campaign has just begun, and the amount of fertilizer accumulated is still increasing.
　　(Our Newspaper) News: "The cooperative only shouts about increasing production, but there are few methods for managing fertilizer, and the quality of fertilizer is getting lower and lower, how can we increase production!" This is the opinion put forward by Fan Shuangxiang, a member of the Qinfeng Cooperative in Jingjiang County, Jiangsu Province, during the "blooming and contending," but at that time, the leading cadres could not find a good way to solve the problem.
　　After the publication of the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft), when the cooperative organized the cooperative cadres to study, Dai Fulong, the secretary of the branch, re-raised the opinions that everyone had debated on the quality of fertilizer, and asked everyone to discuss the question of "what methods should be adopted to improve the fertilizer efficiency of pig manure." After he raised this question, the study meeting turned into a debate. Comrade Shen Deman, the director of the cooperative, said: "The low quality of pig manure cannot be blamed on our cooperative cadres, isn't it because there is not enough feed." Accountant Mao Zhengfeng said: "It is not wrong to say that it is our cooperative cadres' fault. Take my family as an example. Before the cooperative, raising pigs always required getting some grass, collecting some leaves and garbage to pad the pen, of course, the fertilizer efficiency of pig manure was high; after the cooperative, in addition to the green grass cut in summer and autumn recorded as work points to pad inside and outside the pig pen, the rest of the winter and spring seasons only pad some white mud, the quality of pig manure will of course not be good." After he said this, Comrade Dai Youshu jumped up and said: "If you don't mention it, that's fine, but mentioning it reminds me that before the cooperative, my family used grass, garbage, and leaves to pad the pig pen. In one winter and one spring, there were always more than 200 catties. In this way, the fertilizer efficiency was high, and the pigs grew meat easily; after the cooperative, I also got some padding, but the women in the family always nagged, saying that there was not enough grass to burn, and slowly I didn't go to pad it. Only dead yellow mud is padded in the pig pen, and the burden is not small, but the quality is not high."
　　After this analysis, everyone believed that the poor quality of fertilizer now and the shortcomings in fertilizer management were important reasons; and the main key to improving fertilizer efficiency was to conscientiously solve the problem of mutual benefit and mobilize the members to use grass and miscellaneous fertilizer to pad the pig pen. Then, they studied specific methods to improve the quality of pig manure: members padding rice straw were paid at the market price of 2 jiao per 100 catties plus chopping fee, weighed by group; and mobilizing children to cut tree leaves to pad the pen, priced at half the price of rice straw; the rest of the garbage, river bank net silt, and sod were priced as investment by basket. The whole cooperative raised a total of 999 pigs. After this method is implemented, the whole cooperative of 240 households can accumulate 25,000 to 40,000 dan of pig manure by next spring, and the fertilizer quality can be increased by more than 30%, which can increase topdressing for 800 mu of wheat fields.
　　The improved pig manure management method was spread to the team members that night. Chang Zhenggang, a member of the eighth team, said: "With this clear policy and good method, it won't be a loss to use grass to pad the pig pen in the future." Some members also said: "Only a few days after the opinion was put forward, the cadres came up with a solution, the whole cooperative's method is really wonderful and energetic."

    四面八方开辟肥源  认真解决互利问题
    房山县积肥量比去年同期增加九倍  勤丰社改善积肥办法肥料质量提高
    本报讯　河北省房山县在积肥运动中注意执行互利政策，鼓舞了群众的积肥热情，目前全县的积肥量已比去年同期增加九倍以上。
    房山县农民找到的肥源很多，目前主要的肥源，是利用玉米秸、杂草、落叶等进行压肥；利用牲口棚圈、厕所等造肥；此外还有打土坯换炕、熏肥、扫街道、修公共厕所、拾粪等等。全县有玉米秸约一亿斤，除留一部分充作燃料、饲料以外，还有五千万斤，可以用来压肥。目前已铡压肥用的碎秸二千七百多万斤。夏村乡田各庄农业合作社提出“男女老少齐动手，处处肥料堆成山”的口号，边宣传，边找肥源，边积肥。
    各地农业合作社在处理社员所积的肥料的问题上，充分注意了按质论价的互利原则，大大鼓舞了社员积肥的积极性。许多合作社制订或修订了积肥报酬和奖惩的办法。如大次洛农业合作社在生产队内按人规定积肥任务，按定质定量记工分，超额给予奖励。具体办法是：把积肥质量分为甲乙丙三等，各给以不同的作价，并且规定每个人所积的肥料中，丙等肥不能超过15％。积肥超过任务的部分，每“方”多加两分。这个办法对于刺激和督促社员积极积肥，起了很大作用。
    到11月20日止，房山全县已积出成肥和半成肥九亿九千五百多斤，按全县二十二万多亩春播地平均，每亩有肥料四千三百斤，与去年同期比较，积肥量增加九倍以上。现在积肥运动仅仅在开始，积肥量还在不断增加着。
    本报讯　“社里光喊要增产，就是管理肥料办法少，肥料质量越来越低，那能增产呀！”这是江苏靖江县勤丰社社员范双祥在“鸣放”中提出的意见，可是当时领导干部却找不出一个解决问题的好办法。
    全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）公布后，社里组织社干部学习的时候，支部书记戴福龙又把大家曾经争论肥料质量的意见重新提了出来，并请大家讨论“采用什么办法才能提高猪灰肥效”的问题。经他这一提，学习会变成了辩论会。社长沈德满同志说：“猪灰质量低，那能怪我们社干部，还不是饲料不够。”会计毛正丰说：“说怪我们社干部也不错，就我家说，办社前养猪总要常常弄点草，收集点树叶子和垃圾垫垫圈，当然猪灰肥效高；办社后，除夏秋两季砍的青草记工后垫在猪圈内外，其余冬春两季光垫点白泥，猪灰质量当然不会好。”经他这么一说，戴友书同志跳起来说：“不提便罢，一提倒提醒了我，办社前我家猪圈里垫草、垃圾、树叶，一冬一春少说总有二百多斤，这样，肥效高，猪子容易长肉；办社后，我也弄点垫垫，可是家里妇女们总要啰囌，喊草不够烧，慢慢也就不去垫了。猪圈里只垫死黄泥，担子倒不少，就是质量不高。”
    经过这个分析，大家认为现在肥质不好，肥料管理有缺点是重要原因；而提高肥效的主要关键，是认真解决互利问题，发动社员用草加杂肥垫猪圈，接着，便研究了提高猪肥质量的具体办法：社员垫稻草按市价每百斤加二角铡工费，以组为单位过秤；并发动儿童划树叶垫圈，按稻草折半作价；其余垃圾，河坎上网丝泥、草皮按箩计算折价投资。全社共养九百九十九头猪。这办法推行后，全社二百四十户到明春可积取猪肥二万五千担至四万担，肥质还可提高30％以上，可以增加麦田追肥八百亩。
    改进猪肥管理办法，当夜就传到各队社员中去了。八队社员常正岗说：“这一来政策明，办法好，今后用草垫猪圈可不会吃亏了。”有些社员还说：“意见才提出去几天，干部就动脑筋想出了办法，整社的办法真妙，真有劲。”
