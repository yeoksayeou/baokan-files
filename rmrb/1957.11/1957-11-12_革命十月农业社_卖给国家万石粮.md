    Revolutionary October Agricultural Cooperative
    Sells 10,000 Shi of Grain to the State
    (Our report) The Revolutionary October Agricultural Production Cooperative in Suizhong County, Liaoning Province, led by National People's Congress representative Liu Hongda, has decided to sell 60% of its this year’s surplus grain, amounting to 691,848 jin, to the state. The total amount of grain sold by the cooperative will exceed the original procurement target by 44.4%. Including the public grain, this cooperative will deliver and sell 10,000 shi of grain to the state this year. The Revolutionary October Cooperative was established in 1951. This year, the cooperative's total grain output has more than doubled compared to the first year of its establishment, and the average income of the members has also increased from 32 yuan to 73 yuan.
    This spring, the Suizhong County area experienced a drought of sixty to seventy days. The Revolutionary October Cooperative relied on collective strength to overcome the drought and complete the sowing tasks on time. After the crops emerged, the members ensured that "weeds were hoed when they appeared, and water was irrigated when it was dry," ensuring the normal growth of the seedlings. Although this year's harvest is not as good as last year's great bumper harvest, it is still a small bumper year, with the output of sorghum and millet exceeding that of last year.

    革命十月农业社
    卖给国家万石粮
    本报讯　由全国人民代表大会代表刘洪达领导的辽宁省绥中县革命十月农业生产合作社，决定把今年粮食超产部分的60％即六十九万一千八百四十八斤卖给国家。全社的卖粮总数将超过原来的定购任务的44．4％；加上公粮，这个社今年将向国家交售一万石粮食。革命十月社是在1951年建立的，今年全社粮食产量已比建社第一年增加一倍多，社员每人平均收入也由三十二元增加到七十三元。
    今年春季，绥中县一带六、七十天没下雨，革命十月社靠着集体力量战胜了干旱，按时完成了播种任务。庄稼出苗以后，社员们做到了“荒了就铲、旱了就浇”，保证了秧苗的正常生长。今年年成虽说赶不上大丰收的去年，却也是个小丰年，其中高粱、谷子产量超过了去年。
