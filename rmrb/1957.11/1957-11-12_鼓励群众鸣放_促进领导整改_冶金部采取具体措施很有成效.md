Encouraging the Masses to Speak Out; Promoting Leadership Rectification: The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry Achieves Effective Results Through Concrete Measures

    (Our dispatch) To ensure the third stage of the rectification campaign achieves tangible results, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry has stipulated a system requiring leaders at all levels to personally read big-character posters and announce rectification progress weekly. Preliminary results from implementing these two systems demonstrate their significant benefits in encouraging the masses to speak out boldly, urging leaders at all levels to improve their work and style, and strengthening the masses’ confidence in rectification.

    The practice of leaders reading big-character posters began with the Ministry's leadership. Since the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry's departments and bureaus fully transitioned to the third stage on October 23rd, the Ministry’s leaders have inspected big-character posters in the various subordinate departments and bureaus more than ten times. The most significant impact of these inspections has been to promote the development of extensive airing of views in various units. For example, the Mining Bureau originally planned to deliver a mobilization report to the masses on the 28th to mark the transition to the third stage, anticipating that big-character posters would appear after the mobilization report. However, due to the Ministry's leaders’ inspection of the Bureau on the 25th and their publicity of other units’ mass airing of views, many big-character posters were put up the next day. On the 25th, when the Ministry's leaders went to the Iron and Steel Bureau, there was only one big-character poster upon entering, but three were posted by the time they left, and there were thirty to forty by that afternoon. By the 28th, when they returned, they were everywhere. Leaders reading big-character posters also facilitates the timely handling and resolution of problems. For example, when the Ministry's leaders visited the Iron and Steel Bureau, they saw many big-character posters criticizing Du Yinghua, Deputy Director of the Expert Studio in that bureau, for long-term inactivity and exposing serious fabrications of history. They immediately instructed an investigation. After the Iron and Steel Bureau verified the facts, it decided to first dismiss Du Yinghua from his post and then take further action. During the inspection of big-character posters, the Ministry's leaders also collected criticisms raised on the posters regarding the entire Ministry (such as different opinions on the plan to abolish the Mechanical and Power Department and merge the Construction Bureau with the Capital Construction Bureau) and brought them back for study. From this, it can be seen that leaders inspecting big-character posters is a good way to prevent bureaucratism and subjectivism in rectification.

    In addition to the Ministry's leaders inspecting big-character posters, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry’s Rectification Leading Group has also stipulated that all bureau and division chiefs must read big-character posters in their own units every day, and inspect big-character posters in other units of the Ministry every two or three days. This regulation has already begun to be implemented. On November 2nd, more than twenty bureau and division chiefs inspected other units. Many bureaus and divisions have also made regulations for section chiefs and office directors to read big-character posters. At the same time, various bureaus and divisions have sent people to other units to copy opinions criticizing their own units. Some of these opinions are directly responded to publicly, while others are written in written replies and promptly forwarded to the units that raised the opinions.

    The third stage of the rectification campaign is the stage of emphasizing rectification. The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry has formulated a system of announcing rectification progress weekly to ensure the implementation of the spirit of rectifying while rectifying. For example, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry’s Rectification Leading Group has already announced the second phase of rectification progress. The General Office’s Rectification Leading Group has announced rectification progress more than three times, and the Design Bureau and Technical Department have announced rectification progress three times. In the announced rectification progress, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry’s Rectification Leading Group responded to fifteen major and immediately resolvable issues. For example, regarding the organizational structure system plan, some people suggested that everyone should discuss it. The response indicated acceptance of this suggestion and tentatively set the discussion time for late November. Someone criticized the low utilization rate of the Qiqihar warehouse on big-character posters. The response explained that it had been decided to transfer the warehouse to other departments or to local use, and the General Office had been instructed to take specific responsibility for handling it. Someone criticized certain bureau and division chiefs for using cars for private matters. The response stipulated that cadres above the bureau and division chief level should only use cars for official business, not for private matters. Someone suggested that the work of the Citizen Complaints Division of the Supervisory Bureau and the People’s Reception Office of the General Office was duplicated. The response explained that it had been decided to merge the two units. In addition to responding to twelve issues related to organizational structure, cadre style, work style, and welfare, the General Office’s Rectification Leading Group also stated that there were twenty-seven issues that were being studied and could be resolved in a relatively short period of time; they would be announced as soon as the results of the study were available. The Cadre Department, Administrative Department, Supply Bureau, Local Industry Department, Mechanical and Power Department, and Supervisory Bureau also made public responses to some of the issues raised by the masses. The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry’s Rectification Leading Group also made the following statement in the published rectification progress: If there are different opinions on the published handling results, they can be challenged.

    Because the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry implemented the above two systems, it further encouraged the masses' enthusiasm for speaking out, and the number of big-character posters increased daily. For example, on October 28th, there were 526 posters, 630 on the 29th, 716 on the 30th, and 858 on the 31st. As of November 9th, a total of 11,485 big-character posters had been posted throughout the Ministry. The quality of the big-character posters is also constantly improving. For example, in the past, a larger proportion of criticisms were focused on institutions, systems, living conditions and welfare; now, in addition to continuing to raise opinions on the above aspects, the masses are also increasing their criticisms of the style of leadership, the implementation of policies, etc., and the opinions are generally more acute and specific.

    鼓励群众鸣放　促进领导整改
    冶金部采取具体措施很有成效
    本报讯　为了保证整风第三阶段获得切实效果，冶金工业部规定了各级领导干部必须亲自看大字报和每周公布一次整改情况的制度。这两项制度实行的初步结果证明，它们对鼓舞群众大胆鸣放、督促各级领导改进工作和作风以及加强群众对整改的信心，都有很大的好处。
    领导干部看大字报的作法，是从部领导干部开始的。冶金工业部机关自10月23日全部转入第三阶段以来，部里领导同志已在所属各司局连续巡回观看大字报十几次。在巡视过程中，最显著的影响是推动了各单位大鸣大放的开展。如矿山局原来计划在28日向群众作转入第三阶段的动员报告，估计在动员报告之后才会出现大字报，但由于25日部领导干部到局作了巡视，并且宣传了其他单位群众鸣放情况，因此在第二天就有许多大字报贴了出来。25日部领导干部去钢铁局，进门时大字报只有一篇，出门时就贴出了三篇，当天下午就有三、四十篇，到28日再去时，处处都贴满了。领导干部观看大字报，也便于问题的及时处理和解决。如部里领导同志到钢铁局时，看到不少大字报批评该局专家工作室副主任杜英华长期不作工作，并且揭露他捏造历史的严重情况，立即指示加以调查。钢铁局查证属实之后，便决定先将杜英华撤职，然后再作进一步处理。部领导干部在巡视大字报期间，还把各单位大字报上提出的有关整个部的问题（如对取消机械动力司、将建筑局与基本建设局合并的计划，有人提出不同意见），收集起来，带回去加以研究。从这里可以看出，领导干部巡视大字报，是防止在整改中产生官僚主义和主观主义的一种很好的作法。
    除部领导干部巡视大字报以外，冶金工业部整风领导小组还规定所有司、局长每天必须在本单位看大字报，并且每隔二、三天到本部其他单位看大字报。这个规定已经开始实行，11月2日就有二十多名司、局长到外单位巡视。许多司局也作出了处、科长看大字报的规定。同时，各司、局还派出专人到其他单位抄录有关对本单位批评的意见。对这些意见，有的直接公布答复，有的写成书面答复，及时转到提出意见的单位。
    整风第三阶段是着重整改阶段，冶金工业部制定了每周公布一次整改情况的制度，用来保证贯彻边整边改的精神。如冶金部整风领导小组已经公布了第二期整改情况。办公厅整风领导小组已公布了三次以上整改情况，设计局及技术司已公布三次整改情况。冶金部整风领导小组在公布的整改情况中答复了较重大的和能够立即解决的十五个问题。如组织机构体制问题的方案，有人曾提出要大家讨论；答复中表示接受这一意见，并初步确定讨论时间为11月下旬。有人曾在大字报上对齐齐哈尔仓库利用率太低问题提出批评；答复中说明已经决定将该仓库移交其他部门或交由地方使用，已责成办公厅具体负责处理。有人批评某些司局长乘坐小汽车办理私事；答复中规定：司局长以上干部乘坐小汽车，只办公用，私事不用。有人提出监察局公民控诉处与办公厅人民接待室工作有重复，答复中说明已决定将两单位合并。办公厅整风领导小组除答复了有关组织机构、干部作风、工作作风、生活福利等方面的十二个问题之外，并且说明：属于正在研究并能在较短期间可以解决的问题，还有二十七个；一待研究有了结果，即行公布。干部司、行政司、供应局、地方工业司、机械动力司、监察局等单位，也就群众提出的一些问题分别作了公开答复。冶金部整风领导小组在公布的整改情况上还作了如下说明：对公布的处理情况如有不同意见，可以提出争辩。
    冶金工业部由于实行了上述两种制度，更加鼓舞了群众的鸣放热情，大字报的数量日有增加。如10月28日一天为五百二十六篇，29日为六百三十篇，30日为七百一十六篇，31日则增加到八百五十八篇。截至11月9日止全机关共贴出大字报一万一千四百八十五篇。大字报的质量也在不断提高。如过去对机构、体制、生活福利提出的批评意见占比重较大，现在群众除对上述各方面继续提出意见外，对领导干部作风、贯彻执行方针政策等方面的批评也增多起来，而且意见一般比较尖锐、具体。
