(Our dispatch from Nanjing, October 31st) The Jiangsu Provincial-level organs have begun to enter the rectification phase. Provincial, regional, and county-level party committees will transfer 130,000 cadres to lower levels and to participate in agricultural labor. This was announced on the afternoon of the 30th by Liu Shunyuan, Acting First Secretary of the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee, at a meeting of Party member section chiefs and above in provincial-level organs.

In his mobilization report on entering the third stage of the rectification campaign, Comrade Liu Shunyuan requested those present to truly understand that this rectification movement is a profound socialist revolution, in which everyone has a part and everyone must pass this test. Only by deeply recognizing the significance of the rectification can we resolutely overcome the three major isms (subjectivism, sectarianism, and bureaucratism).

Comrade Liu Shunyuan put forward requirements for the rectification of provincial-level organs. He demanded that the inspection of every major task in every department, every unit, and every front should be raised to the principled height of the Party's guidelines and policies to study, and to find out what the main ideological tendencies of the department are, and then propose improvement plans to address their own shortcomings. He pointed out that the bloated organization, overstaffing, and low work efficiency are common phenomena in provincial-level organs, and it is necessary to use a revolutionary spirit to streamline the organization. Therefore, the preliminary decision is: reduce personnel in provincial-level organs by 35% to 50%; reduce personnel in regional and special district-level organs by 40%; and reduce personnel in county-level party committees by 15% to 20%. Reduce the management structure of enterprises and institutions by 50%, totaling 130,000 people, including 9,000 cadres from provincial-level organs. As for the issues of cadres' lives, welfare, wages, etc., these should also be considered as an important part of the rectification.

In his report, Liu Shunyuan emphasized the importance of cadres going to lower levels and participating in labor production. He said that mobilizing cadres to go to the mountains and countryside to participate in agricultural labor not only adds a group of educated laborers to the countryside, preparing conditions for the development of agriculture and the construction of modern agriculture; it is not only the most effective method for ideological remolding of intellectuals, but also the cadre line that our Communist Party has consistently adhered to. From the first day of its establishment, the Party has cultivated and trained a large number of excellent cadres who can withstand storms through this line. When every revolutionary cadre considers whether or not to participate in labor production, they are essentially considering whether or not to continue the revolution. Therefore, Comrade Liu Shunyuan especially reminded leaders at all levels not to have any sentimentalism on the issue of transferring cadres to lower levels. Sentimentalism and leniency towards cadres are actually the most irresponsible behaviors towards the Party and comrades.

Finally, Liu Shunyuan called on leading cadres to carry out major rectification and major changes; and called on cadres being led to continue to greatly unleash their thoughts and boldly criticize the leadership.

    江苏省将下放十三万干部
    刘顺元作整改动员报告强调干部参加生产的重要
    本报南京31日电　江苏省级机关开始转入整改阶段，省、地、县委三级机关将有十三万干部下放和参加农业劳动。这是30日下午，中共江苏省委代理第一书记刘顺元在省一级机关党员科长以上干部会议上宣布的。
    刘顺元同志在这个会议上作了整风转入第三阶段的动员报告。他在报告中要求到会者必须真正地理解这次整改运动是一次深刻的社会主义革命，人人有份，个个都要过这一关。只有深刻地认识整风的意义，才能痛下决心克服三大主义。
    刘顺元同志提出了对省级机关整改的要求。他要求每一部门、每一单位、每一条战线对每一项重大工作的检查，都要提到党的方针政策的原则高度来研究，并且找出本部门主要的思想倾向是什么，然后针对自己的毛病提出改进的方案。他指出：机构庞大、人浮于事、工作效率不高是目前省级机关的普遍现象，必须用革命的精神来紧缩机构。因此初步决定的方案是：省级机关人员减少35％到50％；地委、专区级机关减少40％；县委机关减少15％到20％。企业、事业管理机构减少50％，共计十三万人，其中省级机关干部共九千人。至于干部的生活、福利、工资等问题也要作为整改的一个重要项目。
    刘顺元在报告中着重说明了干部下放、参加劳动生产的重要意义。他说，动员干部上山、下乡参加农业劳动，不仅为农村增加了一批有文化的劳动者，为发展农业、建设现代化的农业准备条件；不仅是对知识分子进行思想改造的最有效的方法，而且是我们共产党一贯坚持的干部路线。党从成立的第一天起，就是通过这条路线培养和锻炼了大批优秀的经得起风浪的干部，每个革命干部当他在考虑自己要不要参加劳动生产的时候，实质上就是在考虑要不要继续革命下去的问题。因此刘顺元同志特别提醒各级领导干部在下放干部的问题上，不能存在丝毫温情主义。温情主义、对干部姑息，实际上就是对党对同志最不负责任的表现。
    最后，刘顺元号召领导干部要大整大改；被领导干部要继续大放大鸣，大胆地向领导开展批评。
