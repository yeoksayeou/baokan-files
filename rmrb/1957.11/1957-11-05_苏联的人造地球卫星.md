The Soviet Artificial Earth Satellite

    October 4, 1957, was a great day in human history. On this day, the Soviet Union successfully launched the world's first artificial Earth satellite, marking the first step for mankind towards outer space. From this day on, human activities exceeded the limitations of the Earth and began to expand into the infinite universe. A month later, the Soviet Union launched a second artificial Earth satellite. This is an epoch-making event in human history and a joyous occasion for all mankind.

    The Soviet Artificial Earth Satellite - A Peace and Happiness Star of the Twentieth Century

    The Soviet Union's first artificial satellite was an aluminum alloy sphere, weighing 83.6 kilograms (167 *shi jin*, a Chinese unit of weight) and measuring 58 centimeters (1.75 *shi chi*, a Chinese unit of length) in diameter. The satellite contained two radio transmitters and necessary batteries. The radio signals they emitted had wavelengths of 15 and 7.5 meters, and frequencies of 20.005 and 40.002 megahertz, respectively. After working perfectly for about three weeks, the radio transmitters ran out of power and have now stopped transmitting. The outside of the satellite had four slender antennas, each 2.4 to 2.9 meters long. The inside of the satellite was filled with nitrogen, which could be forced to circulate inside the satellite to distribute the absorbed heat evenly, so that the instruments could work normally.

    The Soviet Union's second satellite was heavier, larger, and more complex than the first. It weighed 508.3 kilograms and contained a live dog for physiological experiments, as well as instruments for measuring ultraviolet rays, cosmic rays, X-rays, temperature, pressure, etc. In addition, there was food and equipment for observing and recording the dog's physiological reactions. The wavelengths and frequencies of the two transmitters in the satellite were similar to those of the first satellite, but the transmitted signals were slightly different. The last stage of the launch rocket of the second satellite constituted the satellite itself. This is also different from the first satellite.

    Natural satellites are small celestial bodies that orbit a planet periodically. The moon is the Earth's natural satellite. Artificial Earth satellites are artificial small celestial bodies similar to the moon. The orbit of the Soviet Union's first artificial Earth satellite was elliptical. The height of its closest point to the ground (called the perigee) was 400-500 kilometers, and the height of its farthest point (called the apogee) was 900 kilometers. Its average speed around the Earth was 8 kilometers per second (28,800 kilometers per hour) (i.e., the first cosmic velocity), and the time it took to orbit the Earth once was 96 minutes. It orbits the Earth about 15 times every 24 hours, and the angle between the orbital plane and the Earth's equatorial plane is 65 degrees (Figure 1). The angle between the orbital plane of the second satellite and the Earth's equatorial plane is also 65 degrees, and the average speed is the same, but the orbit is higher, at 1,500 kilometers, and the period is longer, at one hour and forty-two minutes.

    The above is some of the known information about the Soviet artificial Earth satellites. People may ask, how can satellites revolve around the Earth without flying away or falling down? First, let's look at the moon. The moon revolves around the Earth at a speed of one kilometer per second (3,600 kilometers per hour). The centrifugal force generated by such a high speed is exactly equal to the Earth's gravitational pull on it. When the two forces are balanced, the satellite revolves along its orbit without flying away or falling down. This is like swinging a stone tied to the end of a rope. At this time, the stone is making a circular motion, and there is a centrifugal force causing the stone to fly outwards; while the rope has a pulling force, pulling the stone so that it does not fly away. When the two forces are balanced, the stone can only continue to circle along its orbit. From this, it can be seen that a primary condition for creating a satellite is that it must have sufficient speed. In addition, it must be in a vacuum, so that there is no air resistance to reduce its speed. Otherwise, it will not be able to maintain a certain inertia to continue flying and will fall to the ground. The reason why it does not fall after the engine stops is also due to inertia.

    How much of the Earth's surface can see the Soviet Union's two satellites? As mentioned earlier, the angle of their orbital planes is 65 degrees. This angle is large, so 95% of the entire Earth's surface can be seen, and only the areas within the Arctic and Antarctic Circles cannot be seen. This is because the satellite's orbit does not move with the Earth's rotation. The satellite moves fast, and the Earth rotates slowly around its axis. The former orbits 15 times every 24 hours, while the latter rotates only once. When the satellite flies to a certain point in its orbit, facing a certain area on the Earth below (such as Beijing), by the time it has circled once and returned to the original point in its orbit, that area on the Earth below (such as Beijing) has moved eastward. The satellite is facing another place to the west of that area. Therefore, the vast area between 65 degrees north and south latitude on the Earth's surface can see the Soviet Union's satellites. Because the position of the satellite in its orbit as it passes over a certain area is different, the direction of its arrival and departure is also different. If the satellite passes over our area in the first half of its orbit, we will see the satellite flying from southwest to northeast; conversely, if it passes over our area in the second half of its orbit, it will fly from northwest to southeast.

    As of October 28, the period of the first artificial satellite had decreased from 96 minutes to 95.31 minutes. The period of the launch rocket decreased even more, to 94.68 minutes, and it ran several thousand kilometers ahead of the satellite. Why is this? One possible explanation is that before the satellite and launch rocket separated, they were flying at the same speed in orbit; at the moment of separation, the satellite jumped forward, and there was a relative speed between it and the rocket. The rocket was slightly slower, the centrifugal force decreased, and it could not balance its weight, so the orbital altitude decreased. The two then operated in different orbits, one high and one low. As the rocket descends, potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. At the same time, as the altitude decreases, the gravitational pull increases. To maintain the lower orbit, its speed will increase. Therefore, the speed of the launch rocket is greater than that of the satellite, and it constantly catches up to the front. By early November, it had overtaken the satellite by more than one revolution.

    From this, we can see that to create an Earth satellite, first, the object must obtain a huge speed of 8 kilometers per second. Second, the object should be at a very high altitude, beyond the atmosphere. Only rockets can meet these two requirements.

    The Soviet Rocket and Jet Science and Technology Leading the World

    Speaking of rockets, they are not actually new. The "fireworks" that are set off into the sky on weekdays are a very simple type of rocket. There are many of these things in our country. The earliest home of rockets was China. However, it is difficult to achieve space travel with gunpowder rockets like "fireworks." More than 50 years ago, the great Soviet scientist Tsiolkovsky proposed the idea of using liquid-fueled rocket engines to fly in interstellar space. Inspired by this idea, and after much arduous scientific work, today, countries around the world are able to produce complete liquid rocket engines in batches.

    Why is it possible to achieve space travel using liquid rocket engines? First, because this type of engine can fly in space without air. It does not need to draw oxygen from the atmosphere to help burn, like ordinary aircraft engines. It carries its own "oxygen." Second, among all aircraft engines, rocket engines can be made the smallest in size, the lightest in weight, and with the greatest thrust. This is because it burns substances that contain a lot of oxygen, not air that contains only one-fifth oxygen. In this way, it can propel the rocket to very high speeds.

    In addition to the engine, what else does a typical rocket need? Now, let's take the V-2 rocket made by Nazi Germany during World War II as an example. This rocket had (Figure 2): an engine installed in the tail, with two large boxes above it. The upper box was a liquid oxygen tank, and the lower box was a 75% concentration alcohol tank. Above that were automatic control instruments, and at the head was a ton of explosives. The two liquid fuels were pumped into the combustion chamber, and the pump was rotated by a steam turbine, which was produced by the decomposition of concentrated hydrogen peroxide. During flight, four fixed tail fins kept the rocket stable. At the tips of the tail fins were four movable rudders, and there were also four rudders at the mouth of the engine. These eight rudders were automatically controlled by instruments to steer the rocket, allowing it to fly stably along a certain trajectory. Therefore, the V-2 rocket can be considered a type of missile. However, from today's scientific and technological level, the precision of its control system is not high. Therefore, it did not play any role in the desperate struggle of Nazi Germany. This type of rocket weighed about 13 tons, of which fuel accounted for 9 tons. The thrust of the engine was 25 tons, which is greater than the weight, making it possible to take off vertically.

    Since World War II, rocket technology has made unprecedented progress. Large-scale research work has been carried out on many aspects of rockets. For example, great achievements have been made in mastering fuels with higher energy content. It is now possible to use high-energy fuels such as kerosene and liquid oxygen, and research is underway to use the energy generated by nuclear fission. The quality of the fuel has a great impact on the performance and weight of the rocket. If the use of atomic fuel is successful, rocket technology will have another major innovation. There will also be great progress in the structure of rockets, adopting light and strong structures, and using better heat-resistant materials; because when a rocket flies at high speed, its surface temperature can reach several hundred degrees due to friction with the air. After improvements in all aspects, modern single-stage rockets can have a range of more than 1,000 kilometers, and their total weight only needs to be a little more than 20 tons. In addition to the greatly increased range, due to the rapid development of automatic control, remote control, electronics, and computer technologies, the control systems of missiles have also made unprecedented progress. The accuracy of hitting targets is astonishing. Modern missiles similar to the V-2 have, in addition to precise automatic control systems, ground remote control to correct their orbital errors. When the missile approaches the target, there is also automatic aiming equipment that allows it to automatically find the target.

    It is impossible to launch artificial satellites and intercontinental missiles (range of 8,000 kilometers) using only single-stage rockets. Earlier, Tsiolkovsky had already put forward the theory of multi-stage rockets. Let's take a look at the "Vanguard" three-stage rocket that the United States often boasts about and plans to use to launch their satellites (Figure 3). The bottom stage of this rocket is the first stage, which uses liquid oxygen and gasoline-mixed alcohol as fuel, and produces a thrust of about 12 tons. The first stage causes the entire rocket, weighing about 10 tons, to rise vertically for more than two minutes. When it reaches a certain altitude, the fuel is used up, it is discarded, and the second stage begins to work (Figure 4). The second stage is a liquid rocket that uses nitric acid and unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine as fuel, and it propels the rocket to a greater speed and higher altitude. At this time, the rocket's orbit is already inclined, and after the second stage has finished working, it is also discarded. At this time, the rocket and satellite fly freely for a while, and continue to climb due to inertia, and the orbit gradually becomes parallel to the ground. At this time, the third-stage solid-fuel rocket is activated, accelerating the satellite to the required speed in a very short time. Finally, the satellite is ejected from the front end of the third-stage rocket. In this way, the artificial satellite can enter orbit and fly around the Earth.

    How does the rocket that launched the Soviet satellite differ from the American "Vanguard"? Considering that the "Vanguard" weighs ten tons while its satellite weighs only a little more than nine kilograms, the total weight of the rocket is about a thousand times that of the satellite it carries. Using this experience as an estimate, the rocket that launched the Soviet Union's first satellite would have to weigh close to a hundred tons. First of all, such a large rocket would be too long if arranged like the "Vanguard," standing at more than forty meters high. Launching something so long is very difficult.

    If we estimate the weight of the Soviet rocket that launched the second satellite based on the experience data of the "Vanguard", it would have to be more than five hundred tons. It is difficult to imagine how something so heavy can fly straight up into the sky! However, if we study it further, we can see that this experience cannot be completely applied. Because, after using fuels with high energy content, the total weight of the rocket will be greatly reduced. Therefore, we believe that Soviet scientists must have mastered much better fuels than the "Vanguard", and have made huge improvements in the engine structure and rocket structure, greatly reducing the weight of the rocket.

    Obviously, launching a rocket weighing one or two hundred tons requires an engine with a thrust of more than one or two hundred tons. Manufacturing such a large engine is very difficult. We estimate that a multi-engine combination method must be adopted. The simultaneous operation of these engines also raises the issue of engine coordination. Soviet scientists have successfully overcome these difficulties. And the American "Vanguard", with only half the thrust of the V-2, is still in the experimental stage!

    Let's compare the satellite orbit situations again. The apogee of the orbit of the satellite that the United States plans to launch is 1,200 kilometers, and the perigee is 320 kilometers. The elliptical shape of the orbit is much flatter than the orbit of the Soviet Union's first satellite. This is not good. Because the lower the perigee, the denser the atmosphere the satellite encounters, the greater the resistance to flight, and the shorter its flight period. If it is any lower, it will immediately burn up due to friction and heat. Therefore, the planned lifespan of the American satellite is only 40 days, while the lifespan of the Soviet satellite is definitely much longer. Why can't the United States launch a satellite with a more circular orbit? Because the height and speed of the rocket's flight must be controlled very precisely so that the orbit can be more circular. This shows that the Soviet Union's automatic and remote control technology level has far surpassed that of the United States.

    A Powerful Weapon for Defending World Peace - The Soviet Artificial Satellites and Intercontinental Missiles

    After the successful launch of the artificial Earth satellite, it caused great shock in the imperialist camp. Why is this? Could it be that an artificial moon weighing only eighty-three kilograms or half a ton would bring some kind of "disaster" to the imperialists? To answer this question, we must talk about the relationship between artificial satellites and intercontinental ballistic missiles.

    A ballistic missile is one in which most of the missile's flight path is a free flight along a certain trajectory like a cannonball; "intercontinental" simply means that it can fly very far. To make a cannonball fly far, the speed at which the cannonball leaves the muzzle (commonly called the initial velocity) must be increased. To make a missile fly far, the speed of the missile must also be increased. According to rough calculations, to obtain a missile with a range of 8,000 kilometers (the type that the Soviet Union successfully test-fired in August of this year), its "initial velocity" when entering ballistic flight is approximately 6.5 kilometers per second (or 24,000 kilometers per hour). This is a little smaller than the speed of 8 kilometers per second for an artificial satellite to enter orbit. However, in order for a missile to hit its target very accurately, it is not enough to have sufficient "initial velocity". It is also necessary to strictly control the pitch angle when entering the trajectory, just as it is necessary to control the pitch angle when a satellite enters orbit. In this way, we can understand it by comparing it with the launch of artificial satellites. From a rocket technology perspective, launching satellites and launching intercontinental missiles is one problem: both must obtain sufficient speed, and both must very accurately control the magnitude and direction of the speed. However, one is a metal satellite, and the other is an atomic warhead or a hydrogen warhead. Being able to launch an artificial satellite definitely means being able to launch an intercontinental missile.

    Therefore, the success of the Soviet Union in launching artificial satellites and intercontinental missiles has frustrated the arrogance of imperialist war-mongers and strengthened the power of the peace and democracy camp. This is of great significance to consolidating and safeguarding world peace.

    Of course, artificial satellites also have their important scientific significance. They make it possible for us to study cosmic phenomena not only on the Earth's surface, but also to fly out of the "atmospheric curtain" covering the Earth to study cosmic phenomena and the Earth itself. More importantly, from now on, mankind has not only theoretically, but also practically, initially solved the problem of space travel.

    The Era of Space Travel Has Begun

    The ideal of space flight was proposed by the great Tsiolkovsky as early as fifty years ago. On November 3rd, the Soviet Union launched another larger artificial satellite. This satellite not only carries more instruments and equipment, but also a living puppy. Through the transmission of radio signals, humans will obtain more and more high-altitude intelligence, which can be used as a basis for further planning space flights and designing spaceships. The living conditions of the puppy in the satellite can also be known on the ground. A more definite answer will be given as to what effect long-term weightlessness will have on physiological functions. This is of great significance for designing manned spaceships and truly realizing human space travel. As the operating altitude increases to 1,500 kilometers, the existence time will also be longer. It is estimated that more complex and better-equipped artificial satellites will be launched in the future to collect the information needed for space flight into orbits at different altitudes.

    The transmission of information mainly relies on radio, and television can also be used. But in order to more accurately obtain data on space flight, it is necessary to launch artificial satellites that can return to the ground. This requires accurately controlling the satellite at high altitude, so that it gradually decelerates and descends along a certain trajectory. It is also necessary to ensure that the satellite is not burned up due to friction and heat when passing through the dense atmosphere, so that it can return to the ground intact.

    The first destination for human space travel will be the moon. To this end, it is first necessary to launch spaceships that can fly to the moon and back, to obtain information about the moon. This requires reaching the second cosmic velocity that is able to break away from the Earth, 11.2 kilometers per second, and the error limit of the velocity is very strict. If it is less than 1%, it will either not fly to the moon or fall onto the moon. If it is greater than one ten-thousandth, it will fly past the moon and will not return to Earth. At present, the Soviet Union is studying various plans for flying to the moon. It is planned that the first vehicle to land on the moon will be an unmanned experimental vehicle. Through the experimental vehicle, humans can know the situation on the moon in advance. It is estimated that this goal may be achieved within 1960-1965.

    The next step is to design manned spaceships. As long as the second cosmic velocity is reached, humans should be able to fly to the moon. However, the supplies for humans on the moon still need to be constantly sent from Earth. According to Tsiolkovsky's space flight plan, the best way is to first establish a space station closer to Earth, which is actually a giant artificial satellite. People can live here for a short period of time to prepare for the next step of travel. It is easier to launch spaceships to the moon or other planets from here. First, the speed of the artificial satellite itself can be used to help the spaceship take off. Secondly, the space station is higher than the Earth's atmosphere, and there is no air resistance. Moreover, because it is closer to the Earth, the equipment and personnel supplies needed to launch the spaceship can be supplied continuously from the Earth. The successful launch of the Soviet Union's second artificial satellite weighing more than half a ton makes it possible to expect that the establishment of a space station is not too far away.

    While flying to the moon, since we have reached the second cosmic velocity, we will also be able to fly to the farther Mars and Venus. Here, we can not only use the operating speed of the space station, but also use the speed of the Earth's revolution around the sun. Soviet scientists are studying this flight plan. It is estimated that unmanned spacecraft can fly to Venus and Mars within 1962-1967. When we have mastered speeds greater than the third cosmic velocity (16.5 kilometers per second), we can consider flying out of the solar system and heading towards other stars. (Attached image)

    苏联的人造地球卫星
    何庆芝　史超礼　曹传钧　李宜敏
    1957年10月4日是人类历史上的一个伟大的日子。在这一天，苏联发射成功了世界上第一颗人造地球卫星；人类迈开了走向宇宙空间的第一步。从这一天起，人类的活动超出了地球的限制，开始向无限的宇宙空间扩展。在一个月后，苏联又发射了第二颗人造地球卫星。这是人类历史上划时代的大事，也是全人类的喜事。
    二十世纪的和平福星——苏联的人造地球卫星
    苏联的第一颗人造卫星是一个铝合金的球体，重八十三点六公斤（一百六十七市斤），直径58公分（1 ．75市尺），卫星中放着两部无线电发报机和必需的电池。它们发出的无线电信号的波长各为十五和七点五公尺，频率各为20．005和40．002兆赫。无线电发报机在完善地工作了大约三个星期以后，电源用完，现已停止发报。卫星的外面有四根长达二点四到二点九公尺的细长天线。卫星的内部充满了氮气，它可以在卫星内进行强制流动，使吸收的热量分布均匀，以便于仪表正常地工作。
    苏联的第二颗卫星和第一颗相较，是更重、更大、更复杂了。它重达五百零八点三公斤，里面装有活狗一条，以便进行生理实验；还有测量紫外线、宇宙线、X射线、温度、压力等的仪器；此外还有食物和观测并纪录狗的生理反应的仪器。卫星中的两部发报机的波长和频率，与第一颗卫星的相仿，只是发报的信号稍有不同。第二颗卫星的最后一级运载火箭即构成卫星的本身。这也是和第一颗卫星不同的地方。
    自然界的卫星是围绕着某一行星、周期性地转动着的小星体。月球就是地球的天然卫星。人造地球卫星就是和月球相似的人造小星体。苏联第一颗人造地球卫星的轨道是椭圆形的。它最接近地面的一点（叫近地点）的高度为四百——五百公里，最远的一点（叫远地点）的高度为九百公里。它环绕地球的平均飞行速度是每秒八公里（每小时二万八千八百公里）（即第一宇宙速度），环绕地球一周的时间是九十六分钟。它每一昼夜（二十四小时）约环绕地球十五圈，轨道平面和地球赤道平面的夹角为六十五度（图1）。第二颗卫星轨道平面的夹角也是六十五度，平均速度亦同，但轨道较高，为一千五百公里，周期也较长，为一小时四十二分。
    以上是苏联人造地球卫星已知的一些情况。人们会问，卫星怎样能绕着地球转，既不飞开去，又不掉下来。首先我们看一下月球。月球绕地球旋转的速度是每秒一公里（每小时三千六百公里）。由这样大速度所产生的离心力正好等于地球对它的吸引力，二力平衡，卫星就沿着轨道转动，既不飞开，也不下落。正如用手牵着一根前端系有石子的绳索转圈子的情况一样。这时石子在作环绕运动，有离心力在使石子向外飞；而绳索有拉力，拉着石子不让它飞开，二力平衡，于是石子只能沿着轨道不断地兜圈子。由此可见，创造卫星的一个首要的条件是必须有足够的速度。另外，它还必须处于真空，使得没有空气阻力来减低它的速度。否则它就不能维持一定的惯性继续飞行，而会向地面落下来。它之所以能在发动机停车后不下落也是依靠惯性。
      地面有多大地区能够看到苏联的两颗卫星呢？它们的轨道平面的夹角如前所述是65度。这个角度很大，因而整个地球表面95％的地区都可看到，只有南北极圈之内的地区看不到。因为卫星轨道不随地球的自转而移动。卫星走的快，地球绕地轴转的慢，前者每二十四小时绕十五圈，后者只转一圈。卫星在轨道上飞到某一点，对着下面地球上某一地区（如北京），等它绕一圈再回到轨道原处时，下面地球上的那一地区（比如北京）已向东移动了。卫星所面对的是那一地区之西的另一处。因此，在地球表面上南北纬65度之间的广大地区都可以看到苏联的卫星。由于卫星经过某一地区在轨道上的位置不同，去来的方向也就不同。如果卫星在前半圈经过我们所在的地区，我们将看到卫星从西南飞向东北；反之，如在后半圈，它将从西北飞向东南。
    到10月28日为止，第一颗人造卫星的周期已从96分钟减为95．31分。运载火箭的周期减的更多，它已减至94．68分，并且跑到卫星前面好几千公里。为什么会这样？一种可能的解释是，卫星和运载火箭未分离前，在轨道上飞行时，速度相等；在分离的瞬间，卫星向前跳出，它和火箭之间有了相对速度，火箭略慢，离心力减小，不能平衡重量，因而轨道高度降低。二者便在一高一低的不同轨道上运行。当火箭下降时，势能转为动能，同时，高度减低，吸引力增大，为维持较低的轨道，都将使它的速度增加。因此运载火箭的速度大于卫星，不断地赶到它的前面去。到11月初，它已赶过卫星一圈多了。
    由此可知，要创造地球卫星，首先必须使物体获得每秒八公里的巨大速度。其次，应该使物体的高度很高，超出大气层之外。而能满足这两项要求的只有火箭。
    走在世界最前列的苏联火箭喷气科学技术
    说起火箭，其实并不新奇。平日放射到天空中去的“起花”就是一种最简单的火箭。这类东西在我国是很多的。火箭的最早的祖国就是中国。但是，只用“起花”这一类火药火箭很难实现宇宙间的航行。苏联大科学家齐奥尔科夫斯基在五十多年前就提出了利用液体燃料火箭发动机飞行于星际空间的思想。在这种思想的启示下，又经过许多艰巨的科学工作，今天世界各国已能成批生产完好的液体火箭发动机了。
    为什么利用液体火箭发动机才可能实现宇宙航行呢？第一、因为这种发动机能够在没有空气的空间里飞行。它不像普通飞机发动机那样必需吸取大气中的氧来帮助燃烧。它的“氧”是自己携带的。第二、在所有航空用发动机中，火箭发动机能做得尺寸最小、重量最轻、而推力最大。因为它燃烧所用的不是含氧气只有五分之一的空气，而是含氧很多的物质。这样，它就能推动火箭达到非常高的速度。
    除发动机外，一般火箭还需要有哪些东西呢？现在举第二次世界大战时纳粹德国制造的V—2火箭做为例子。这个火箭上有：（图2）装在尾部的发动机，上面有两只大箱子，靠上的是液体氧箱，靠下的是浓度为75％的酒精箱，再上面是自动操纵的仪器，头上是一吨的炸药。两种液体燃料用泵打进燃烧室去，而泵是用蒸汽涡轮转动，蒸汽是由浓缩的过氧化氢分解所产生的。飞行时靠四片固定的尾翼来保持稳定。尾翼尖端有四片活动的舵，发动机口上也有四个舵。这八片舵受仪器自动控制来操纵火箭，使它按一定的轨道稳定地飞行。因此，V—2火箭可以算是一种导弹。但是从今天的科学技术水平来看，它的操纵系统的精密度是不高的。因此它没有在德国纳粹的垂死挣扎的战斗中起任何作用。这种火箭重约十三吨，其中燃料占九吨，发动机的推力为二十五吨，推力大于重量，也就有可能垂直起飞。
    从第二次世界大战以来，火箭技术有了空前巨大的进展。在有关火箭的许多方面都进行了大规模的研究工作。例如在掌握含能量更大的燃料上，已经取得很大成就，现在已经能使用像煤油和液氧这样大能量的燃料，并正在研究采用核子分裂所产生的能量。燃料的好坏对于火箭的性能以及重量有很大的影响。如果使用原子燃料能够成功，火箭技术必将又有一个大的革新。在火箭的结构上也将有很大进展，采取又轻、又坚固的结构，使用更好的耐热材料；因为高速飞行的火箭与空气摩擦时，它的表面温度会高到几百度。经过各方面的改进，近代的单级火箭的射程可以超过一千公里，而它的总重量只需要二十吨多一些。除射程大大提高了以外，由于自动控制、遥远控制、电子学及计算机等技术的飞跃发展，导弹的控制系统也得到空前的进步，击中目标的精确性是惊人的。现在的类似V—2的导弹除了有精确的自动控制系统外，还有地面遥远控制来修正它的轨道误差。当导弹接近目标时又有自动瞄准设备使它能自动寻找目标。
    发射人造卫星和洲际导弹（射程为八千公里）只用单级火箭是不行的。最早，齐奥尔科夫斯基已经提出了多级火箭的论点。我们就拿美国所经常炫耀的计划用来发射他们的卫星的“先锋”号三级火箭来看一看（图3）。这种火箭的最下一段是第一级，用液氧和掺有汽油的酒精做燃料，发出推力约十二吨。第一级使总重约为十吨的整个火箭垂直上升两分多钟，达到一定高度时，燃料用尽，它就被抛掉，并且第二级开始工作（图4）。第二级是用硝酸和二甲联胺做燃料的液体火箭，它推动火箭到更大速度和更高高度。这时火箭轨道已经倾斜，第二级工作完了后也被抛掉。这时，火箭和卫星自由飞行一段，靠惯性作用继续爬高，并且轨道逐渐变得和地面平行。这时，开动第三级火药火箭，用很短的时间把卫星加速到所要求的速度。最后，卫星从第三级火箭的前端弹出。这样人造卫星就可以走上轨道绕地球飞行了。
    发射苏联卫星的火箭和美国的“先锋”号有什么不同呢？就拿“先锋”号重为十吨而它的卫星只有九公斤多来看，火箭的总重为它所带的卫星的一千倍左右。用这条经验估计一下，那么苏联发射第一颗卫星的火箭就得靠近一百吨重了。首先，这么大的火箭如果按照“先锋”号那样安排就会太长了，立起来就有四十多公尺高。发射这么长的东西是很困难的。
    如果按照“先锋”号的经验数据估计一下发射第二颗卫星的苏联火箭重量，那就得五百多吨了。很难想像这么重的东西怎能直飞上空！但是，我们进一步研究一下就可以看出这条经验不能完全套用。因为，采用含能量大的燃料以后，火箭总重就会大大减轻。所以，我们相信苏联科学家们必然是掌握了比“先锋”号更好得多的燃料，并且在发动机构造和火箭结构方面做了巨大的改进，使火箭重量大大地减轻了。
    很明显，起飞一二百吨重的火箭需要推力超过一二百吨的发动机。制造这么大的发动机是很困难。我们估计必须采用多发动机组合的方式。这些发动机同时工作，就又引起发动机工作的协调问题。苏联科学家成功地克服了这些困难。而美国的推力仅及V—2一半的“先锋”号还在试验阶段！
    我们再把卫星轨道的情况比较一下。美国计划发射的卫星轨道远地点为一千二百公里，近地点为三百二十公里。轨道的椭圆形状是比苏联第一颗卫星轨道扁得多。这是不好的。因为，近地点越低，卫星所接触的大气越密，飞行所受阻力越大，它的飞行期间越短。再低一些，就马上由于摩擦生热而被烧毁。所以，美国计划的卫星寿命只有四十天，而苏联的卫星寿命肯定是要长得多。为什么美国不能发射比较圆一点的轨道的卫星？因为要把火箭飞行的高度和速度控制得很精确，那么轨道才可以比较圆一些。这就可以看得出：苏联的火箭自动与遥远控制技术水平已经远远地超过了美国。
    保卫世界和平的有力武器——苏联的人造卫星和洲际导弹
    人造地球卫星发射成功以后，在帝国主义阵营中引起了极大的震动，这是为什么呢？难道说，一个重量只有八十三公斤或半吨的人造小月球会给帝国主义者带来什么“灾难”吗？要解答这个问题，就要谈谈人造卫星和洲际弹道式导弹的关系。
    所谓弹道式导弹，是说导弹大部分飞行路线是像炮弹一样按一定的弹道自由飞行的；“洲际”，不过是说它可以飞的很远而已。要炮弹飞的远，就要加大炮弹离开炮口的速度（普通称为初速），要导弹飞的远，也要加大导弹的速度。要得到射程为八千公里的导弹（苏联在今年8月试发成功的就是这种类型），据粗略的计算，它进入弹道飞行的“初速”大约是每秒六点五公里（也就是每小时二万四千公里）。这比人造卫星进入轨道的速度每秒八公里还要小些。但是要想导弹很准确地命中目标，光有足够的“初速”不行，还要严格地控制进入弹道时的俯仰角，正像要控制卫星进入轨道时的俯仰角一样。这样，我们把它和人造卫星的发射情况一比较便明白了。发射卫星和发射洲际导弹从火箭技术上看是一个问题：都要获得足够的速度，并要非常准确地控制速度的大小和方向。不过一个是金属的卫星，一个是原子弹头或氢弹头而已。能发射人造卫星，就一定能发射洲际导弹。
    因此，苏联发射人造卫星和洲际导弹的成功，挫杀了帝国主义战争鼓动者的气焰，加强了和平民主阵营的力量。这对巩固和保卫世界和平，有极重大的意义。
    当然，人造卫星还有它科学上的重要意义，它使我们有可能不仅在地球表面研究宇宙现象，而能飞出笼罩着地球的“大气幕”之外去研究宇宙现象和地球本身。而更重要的是，从此人类不仅在理论上，而且在实践上初步解决了宇宙航行的问题。
      宇宙航行的时代开始了
    宇宙飞行的理想早在五十年前就由伟大的齐奥尔科夫斯基提出来了。11月3日苏联又发射了第二个更大的人造卫星。这颗卫星不仅带有更多的仪器设备，而且还有活着的小狗。通过无线电信号的传递，人类所获知的高空情报将越来越多，可以作为进一步计划空间飞行、设计宇宙飞船的根据。小狗在卫星中生活的情况也可以在地面得知。长时期在失去重量的环境下，究竟对生理作用要起甚么影响，就会有较确实的答案。这对设计载人的宇宙飞船，使人类真正实现宇宙航行有很大的意义。由于运行的高度增加到一千五百公里，存在的时间也会更长。估计今后还将放出构造更复杂、设备更齐全的人造卫星，到不同高度的轨道上去搜集宇宙飞行所需要的情报。
    情报的传递主要靠无线电，也可用电视。但为了更确切地取得空间飞行的资料，需要放出可以回到地面上来的人造卫星。这就要求准确地在高空中操纵卫星，使它沿一定轨道逐渐减速下降。而且还要保证在经过稠密的大气层时，不会因摩擦生热而将卫星烧毁，才能使卫星完整地回到地面来。
    人类进行宇宙飞行的第一个目的地将是月亮。为此，首先必须放出飞往月亮而又能飞回来的飞船，以获取月亮上的情报。这需要达到能脱离地球的第二宇宙速度，每秒十一点二公里，而且速度的误差限制很严，如果小过1％，就会飞不到月亮或是落到月亮上去，如果大过万分之一，又要飞过月亮，都不会回到地球上来了。目前苏联正在研究各种飞向月亮的方案，计划头一个在月亮上着陆的将是一辆无人驾驶的实验车，通过实验车，人类就可以先期知道月亮上的情况。估计这个目的在1960—1965年内可能实现。
    下一步就是设计载人的宇宙飞船。只要达到了第二宇宙速度，人类就应该可以飞往月亮。但是人在月亮上的供应，还需要不断地从地球送来。根据齐奥尔科夫斯基空间飞行的计划，最好的办法是先建立离地球较近的空间站，实际上就是一个巨型的人造卫星。人在这里可以作短期的居住，以准备下一步的旅行。从这里发射出飞往月亮或其他星球的宇宙飞船，就更容易了。首先是人造卫星本身的速度可以用来帮助飞船起飞。其次是空间站高出地球大气层以外，没有空气阻力。而且由于离地球较近，发射飞船所需的设备和人员的给养，都可以源源自地球供应。苏联第二个重量超过半吨的人造卫星发射成功，可以预期空间站的建立，并不是太远的事情了。
    在飞往月亮的同时，由于达到了第二宇宙速度，我们也就有可能飞到更远的火星和金星上去。这里不仅可以利用空间站的运行速度，而且还可以利用地球绕太阳公转的速度。苏联科学家正在研究这种飞行的方案。估计在1962—1967年内无人驾驶的飞船就可以飞往金星和火星了。等到我们掌握了比第三宇宙速度（每秒十六点五公里）更大的速度时，我们就可以考虑飞离太阳系，而向其他的恒星进发。（附图片）
