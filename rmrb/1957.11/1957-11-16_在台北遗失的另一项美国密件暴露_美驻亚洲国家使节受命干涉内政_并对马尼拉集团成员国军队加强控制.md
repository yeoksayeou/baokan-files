Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, November 15th. Another secret document from the American Embassy in Taipei, lost during the anti-American demonstrations in Taipei, was recently published by the Indian weekly "Blitz," exposing the crimes of the U.S. State Department in directing its ambassadors to engage in subversive activities, interfering in the internal affairs of Asian countries, and strengthening control over the armies of member states of the Manila Treaty Organization through the treaty organization.

This secret document is Telegram Instruction No. 1109, issued by the U.S. State Department to U.S. embassies throughout Asia on March 21st regarding the results of the Manila Treaty Canberra Conference.

The telegram instruction stated: "It is also essential that in carrying out previous instructions regarding the importance of increasing contacts with opposition leaders who demonstrate an understanding of the tasks facing the free world, more vigorous action be demonstrated. Efforts must continue to give those in power the impression that their position is directly dependent upon their loyalty to the United States."

The U.S. State Department also gave the following instruction in this telegram: "Control of the armed forces of the Asian members of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization remains our primary objective. Therefore, no effort should be spared to break down the hesitancy of local governments in establishing a joint armed force and joint command for the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. It should be remembered that the United States plans to pass a resolution to that effect at the 1958 Southeast Asia Treaty Organization Council meeting."

The U.S. State Department also instructed U.S. diplomatic envoys to prevent member states of the Manila Treaty Organization from requesting economic assistance. The telegram instruction stated: "We must strive to resist the tendency of Southeast Asia Treaty Organization members to limit themselves solely to seeking economic objectives through U.S. aid, and whenever possible, prevent the emergence of plans to establish economic organizations within the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. Such organizations would only undermine the military nature of the treaty. As your guide, military assistance will continue to be the primary form of U.S. aid to Asian members of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, while economic assistance should be greatly reduced."

The U.S. State Department's telegram instruction stated at the beginning: "The recent meeting of the Manila Treaty Council revealed a tendency on the part of some of its members, such as Thailand, Pakistan, and the Philippines, to utilize the organization primarily as another source of economic assistance. Another disappointing factor is the Council's lack of understanding of our proposed policy regarding Communist China. Some members of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization apparently hope to develop economic and political relations with Peiping, although they try to conceal this fact. The intelligence we possess indicates that this trend has become quite widespread in Southeast Asia Treaty Organization countries as a result of the foreign policies pursued by India, Burma, and Indonesia."

The telegram instruction stated: "In view of the above, the reasons for the insufficient efforts to curb this trend should be investigated. For example, the embassies and those engaged in special missions have not been active enough in implementing State Department Circular No. 292 of April 17, 1956. We must strengthen the position of our friends in the local governments and support those who, being less influenced by nationalist ideas, are more likely to carry out the tasks facing the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization."

The "Blitz" weekly believes that the actions of the U.S. embassies abroad are the actions of international gangsters. The weekly also said that this secret document illustrates the extent to which the United States abuses diplomatic privileges.

### 在台北遗失的另一项美国密件暴露  美驻亚洲国家使节受命干涉内政  并对马尼拉集团成员国军队加强控制

    在台北遗失的另一项美国密件暴露
    美驻亚洲国家使节受命干涉内政
    并对马尼拉集团成员国军队加强控制
    新华社新德里15日电　印度“闪电”周刊最近刊载的另一件台北美国大使馆在台北反美示威期间遗失的秘密文件，揭露了美国国务院指挥驻外使节从事颠覆活动、干涉亚洲国家的内政和通过马尼拉条约组织来加强控制这个条约的成员国的军队等罪恶行径。
    这个密件是美国国务院在3月21日发给美国驻亚洲各地大使馆的关于马尼拉条约堪培拉会议结果的电报指示，编为第一一○九号。
    电报指示说：“在执行先前关于加强同那些对于自由世界所面临的任务表明有了解的反对党领袖的接触的重要性的指示时也必须表现出更加积极有力。必须继续努力给那些执政者这样一个印象：他们的地位直接决定于他们对美国的忠诚。”
    美国国务院在这份电报里还作了这样的指示：“对东南亚条约组织的亚洲成员的武装部队的控制仍然是我们的首要目的。因此，必须不遗余力地来打破当地政府在成立东南亚条约组织联合武装部队和联合司令部的问题上的犹豫不决态度。应该记得，美国计划在1958年东南亚条约组织理事会上通过大意如此的决议。”
    美国国务院还指示美国的外交使节防止马尼拉条约组织成员国要求经济援助。电报指示说：“我们必须竭力反对东南亚条约组织成员把他们自己仅仅局限于通过美国援助来谋求经济目的的趋势，并且不管在什么时候只要有可能就要防止出现在东南亚条约组织内部建立经济组织的计划。这种组织只会破坏这个条约的军事性质。作为你们的指南，军事援助将继续是美国对东南亚条约组织的亚洲成员的援助的主要方式，而经济援助要大大地削减。”
    美国国务院的这份电报指示在开头时说：“马尼拉条约理事会最近举行的会议透露了它的某些成员，如像泰国、巴基斯坦和菲律宾，有利用这个组织主要作为经济援助的又一来源的趋势。令人失望的另一个因素是理事会对于我们所建议的关于共产党中国的方针缺乏了解。东南亚条约组织的某些成员显然希望和北平发展经济和政治关系，虽然它们试图掩盖这个事实。我们所持有的情报表明，由于印度、缅甸和印度尼西亚所执行的外交政策的结果，这种趋势在东南亚条约组织国家中已经相当普遍。”
    电报指示说：“鉴于上述的情况，应该调查为了制止这种趋势而作的努力不够充分的原因。例如，各使馆和从事特别任务的人们在执行1956年4月17日国务院第二九二号传阅文件时不够积极有力。我们必须加强我们在当地政府中的朋友的地位，并且支持那些由于受民族主义思想影响较少而更有可能执行东南亚条约组织面临的任务的人。”
    “闪电”周刊认为美国驻外大使馆的行为是国际匪徒的行为。这家周刊还说，这份密件说明了美国滥用外交特权到什么地步。
