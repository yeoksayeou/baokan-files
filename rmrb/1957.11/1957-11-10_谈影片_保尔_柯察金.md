    On the Film "Pavel Korchagin"
    Jia Ji
    Not long ago, the movie posters for "Pavel Korchagin" were put up on the streets, arousing great concern about the film. Because: Pavel Korchagin, the model of wholehearted dedication to the communist ideal and the heroic sacrifice for the cause of the proletarian revolution, his immortal image has long been deeply rooted in the hearts of millions of readers of our era. How everyone hopes that the Pavel on the screen matches the hero in their minds! Although this is such a difficult thing in creation, after watching this passionate and moving film, we are greatly satisfied.
    We see that although the filmmakers were faced with a very successful masterpiece, they still approached the adaptation work with a creative attitude. They didn't just put the original work on the screen as it was, but from the needs of the film style, and from the perspective of the realistic educational significance of the theme, they chose the main content to be expressed in the film. The film mainly shows Pavel Korchagin participating in the labor and struggle to restore economic construction in the difficult years of the early revolution. Therefore, after watching the film, our most profound impression is first of all the image of Pavel in labor and his contemporary young people.
    Here, the film's director, cinematographer, and art designer show how enthusiastic they are as singers! They are talented painters who depict labor!
    The scene of building the railway, the text manuscript is only a few lines, but what is reflected on the screen is such a rich and touching scene! In order to truly reproduce the arduous labor of the heroes that year, the film's director and cinematographer used a variety of tones to depict it from various angles. Some of these pictures are like richly colored oil paintings, some are like clear and bright ink paintings, and some are like a series of silhouettes... The authors portray people's labor in such a colorful and fascinating way.
    When we see these pictures, we will naturally think: we are also participating in the socialist construction labor today; and how different is this from Pavel and their time! Their labor at that time was the most arduous; they—the first batch of Communist Youth League members in the Soviet Union—had to carry out labor under the oppression of severe cold, disease, and poverty. However, even at that time, labor was a magnificent undertaking; people's lofty ideals for building a new life and the iron will to overcome all difficulties made labor radiate a charming brilliance. This is another valuable point of the film. The authors are not simply pursuing changes in tone, no; every picture arranged here is to express people, to express people's labor.
    Many of the dialogues and details described here are also characteristic and successful. For example: How did Pavel insist on stepping through the muddy ground in the pouring rain after his boot soles fell off, refusing to go back, and saying with a smile: "It's still manageable"; he also shoveled soil one shovel at a time; when his typhoid fever had already broken out and his spine could no longer straighten up, how did he struggle alone on the cold cement floor to stand up, saying: "You're decadent? How despicable! Your comrades have gone to work. Stand up! Stand up! Stand up!" In this way, he finally picked up the shovel, faced the wind and snow, and walked to the construction site; at this moment, the voice-over revealed Pavel's inner excitement: "...Must not fall!..." He raised the shovel; he fell down...
    In addition, like Franz Klavichek, the young man with glasses, the authors never intended to describe the physiological pain of a person before death for his sacrifice; on the contrary, for the portrayal of this character, the screenwriter, director and actors' last stroke is also extremely satisfactory. This gentle Communist Youth League member did not lose his sense of humor and optimism before his death. After enduring the fatal pain and alerting his comrades, he carefully adjusted his glasses, and then raised his gun one last time at the enemy; when he felt he was aiming, he was with such a satisfied mood, although at this time, the gun in his hand fell, and he used up his last strength. But a smile still floated on his face...
    In addition to the excellent depiction of labor scenes in the film, the authors' narration of other events in Pavel's life is also extremely concise and clever.
    For example, about the first love with Tonya, the film uses a detail that is not in the novel: on the bridge, the train sped by, Tonya panicked and hugged Pavel, Pavel naturally hugged her too, she glanced at Pavel shyly, and hugged him tighter; but then woke up as if facing each other, released her hand. Using this detail to show their relationship and psychological state at that time is very accurate and vivid.
    For example, how Pavel went from the infantry to the cavalry, and how he fought in the First Cavalry Division, the film described these scenes through a family letter lost on the battlefield that was not sent and a voice-over. Such a description not only saves ink, but is also full of poetry.
    The film's depiction of Pavel's life history is unique in terms of the overall plot structure. The film begins with Pavel's memories, and all events in the film are presented as the protagonist's recollection of the path he has taken. However, this is not just about reminiscing about the difficulties and severe tests of the past, but about drawing new strength from them to strengthen the current labor and struggle. The end of the film is exactly like this: although Pavel is paralyzed and blind; however, he wakes up from a quiet contemplation, and then says firmly and confidently: "I want to work, start writing from the beginning, start writing from the beginning!" His hand lying on the bed is writing: "How the Steel Was Tempered"!
    It is precisely the image of such a steel-like hero that has set a model for us that is always worth learning from.

    谈影片“保尔·柯察金”
    贾霁
    前不久，“保尔·柯察金”电影海报刚刚贴上街头，就引起人们对于影片的极大的关心。因为：保尔·柯察金，这全心全意为共产主义理想、为无产阶级革命事业英勇献身的典范，他的不朽的形象，早已深藏在我们这个时代的千百万读者的心中。每个人是怎样地希望着银幕上的保尔和自己心目中的英雄相符啊！尽管这在创作上又是多么不容易的事情，但是，看过这部热情充沛的动人的影片之后，我们却得到了很大的满足。
    我们看到：尽管影片的制作者们面前摆着的是一部非常成功的名著，但是，他们仍然以创造性的态度来对待改编工作。他们不是把原著照样搬上银幕就算完事，而是从电影样式的需要，并且从主题的现实教育意义方面来着眼、来构思，而选择了影片所要表现的主要的内容。影片主要表现了革命初期的艰苦年代里，保尔·柯察金参加恢复经济建设的劳动和斗争。因此，我们看过影片之后，印象最深刻的首先是劳动中的保尔和他的同辈青年人的形象。
    在这里，影片的导演、摄影师、美工师表现出他们是多么热忱的歌者！是描绘劳动的才华洋溢的画家！
    修筑铁路这一段戏，文字稿不过寥寥几行，然而体现在银幕上的，却是多么丰富的感人的场面！为了真实地再现英雄们当年艰巨的劳动，影片的导演和摄影师用了多种色调，从各个角度来描绘它。这些画面，有的像色彩浓郁的油画，有的像线条清晰明朗的水墨画，有的又像是一串剪影……作者们把人们的劳动表现得这样多姿多彩，引人入胜。
    我们看到这些画面，很自然地会想到：我们今天也要参加社会主义的建设劳动；而这和保尔他们当时是有着多大的差异！他们那个时候的劳动，是最艰苦的；他们——苏维埃国家的第一批共青团员，不得不在严寒、疾病和贫困的交迫下，进行劳动。但是，就在那个时候，劳动也是壮丽的事业；人们为建设新生活的崇高理想和不怕一切困难的钢铁般的意志使劳动放出了魅人的异彩。这正是影片又一个可贵的地方。作者们不是单纯地追求色调的变化，不是的；这里安排的每一个画面，都是为了表现人，表现人们的劳动。
    这里的许多对话和细节描写，也都是富有特色的，成功的。例如：保尔是怎样在靴底掉了之后仍然坚持着在浇着大雨的泥泞里一脚一脚踩过来，拒绝回去，并且笑吟吟地说：“还能对付”；他也一锹一锹地挖起土来了；在他的伤寒病已经发作、脊椎骨已经直不起来的时候，他独自在冰冷的水门汀地上又是怎样地挣扎着要站起来，说：“你颓废了？这多卑鄙！你的同志都去干活了。站起来！站起来！站起来！”这样，他终于拿起铁锹，迎着风雪，走到工地；这当儿，画外音揭示出保尔内心的激动：“……千万不能摔倒！……”他举起铁锹；他倒了下去……
    此外，像弗朗兹·克拉维赤克，那个戴眼镜的青年，对他的牺牲，作者们也决不曾打算去描写一个人死前生理上的痛苦；相反，对于这个人物的刻划，编剧、导演和演员的最后的一笔，也是极为圆满的。这个性格温和的共青团员，临死也没有失掉他的幽默感和乐天的品性。他忍住致命的伤痛向同志们发出警报以后，就细心地整理眼镜，然后向敌人那里最后一次举起枪来；当他觉得是瞄准了的时候，他是带着那样满意的心情，虽然也就在这时候，他手里的枪掉下来了，他最后的力气用完了。但是他的脸上依旧浮着微笑……
    影片除了关于劳动场景的描写很出色以外，作者们对于保尔一生其它事件的叙述，也是极为简洁和聪明的。
    例如和冬妮亚的初恋，影片中用了一个小说中所没有的细节：在桥上，火车飞快地开过来，冬妮亚一时惊慌地搂住了保尔，保尔也自然地搂住了她，她羞怯地看了保尔一眼，更紧地抱着他；但是随即醒了似地一照面，把手松开了。用这个细节来表明他们当时的关系和心理状态，是很确切、也很生动的。
    又如保尔怎样从步兵转到骑兵中去，以及他在骑兵第一师是怎样战斗的，影片通过一封遗失在战场上的没有发出去的家信和画外音，描叙了这些情景。这样的描写不仅节省笔墨，也富有诗意。
    影片对于保尔一生历史的描叙，就整个情节结构来说，是独特的。影片从保尔的回忆开始，影片中的一切事件都表现为主人公对自己所走过的道路的回忆。但是，这并不仅仅在于怀念过去的困难和严峻的考验，而是在于从那些里面汲取新的力量，来加强现在的劳动和斗争。影片的结尾正是这样：虽然保尔全身瘫痪了，双目失明了；但是，他从宁静的沉思中醒过来，随即坚定而充满信心地说道：“我要工作了，从头写，从头写起！”躺在床上的他的手写着：“钢铁是怎样炼成的”！
    正是这样的钢铁般的英雄的形象，给我们树立了永远值得学习的榜样。
