Liaoning to Send 200,000 Cadres Down to the Very Bottom

(Report from our newspaper) Liaoning Province will send approximately 200,000 cadres to the grassroots level before April of next year. The vast majority of these cadres will go to the countryside and mountains to participate in agricultural production. Some will return to other production posts, or be transferred to strengthen grassroots leadership in rural areas, cultural and educational fields, local industry, and financial and trade sectors.

This decision was made at a meeting of municipal and regional Party committee secretaries convened by the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party at the end of October. In accordance with the spirit of the Third Plenary Session, the meeting repeatedly discussed the work of sending cadres down to lower levels throughout the province. The meeting concluded that although Liaoning Province had already sent more than 17,000 cadres down to lower levels in the past year, the phenomenon of bloated organizations, overlapping levels, and overstaffing in Party and government organs and enterprises and institutions throughout the province remained very serious. There were too many leading comrades and staff members at all levels of state administrative organs, and many of these staff members were young people who had not been tempered and tested in struggle and lacked production and work experience. The problems in institutions and enterprises were particularly serious. On average, non-production personnel (management and service personnel) in state-owned factories and mines across the province accounted for 36.2% of the total, while in local state-owned factories and mines, the average was 26.7%, with some reaching as high as 60%. In the commercial system, an average county had only five or six companies in 1955, which basically met the needs of the work. However, in 1956, this increased to more than ten, and management and service personnel also increased, accounting for 51.3% of the total number of employees. In some universities and colleges, the ratio of faculty and staff to students was almost one to one. This phenomenon not only fostered the development of subjectivism and bureaucracy, affected the improvement of work efficiency, and hindered the enthusiasm of the broad masses, but also wasted the state's human and material resources and was not conducive to the training of cadres.

In light of the above situation, the meeting emphasized that it is necessary to streamline organizations on a large scale with a revolutionary spirit and revolutionary methods in this rectification movement, and to transfer a large number of cadres to the grassroots level to replenish the labor front. The meeting also held that, due to the characteristics of Liaoning Province, which has many factories, mines, and enterprises, the focus of streamlining organizations should be on enterprises and institutions from a global perspective. Generally, the number of non-production personnel in enterprises and institutions should be reduced by one-half, and in some cases by two-thirds, but in no case should it be less than one-third. After streamlining organizations, the proportion of management personnel in state-owned industry throughout the province will be reduced from the current 18.6% to 10.65%; the proportion of management personnel in local state-owned industry will be reduced from 16.2% to 9.03%. On the basis of the original streamlining of 16.3% of staffing, state administrative organs are required to further streamline by more than 10%; provincial-level organs will streamline by more than 50% in total (already reduced by 30%). The meeting pointed out that as long as the leadership is determined, fully mobilizes the masses, and takes various measures, the above targets can be achieved. In order to do this work well, Party committees at all levels must strengthen leadership, fully mobilize the masses, and launch a massive movement to streamline organizations in the third stage of the rectification movement, adopting the methods of extensive airing of views, big debates, and big character posters. The general requirements of this movement are: be fast, be numerous, be good. Action should be taken immediately from now on, and efforts should be made to conclude by April of next year. Action should be taken from top to bottom, and cadres in senior organs should be the first to go down to set an example. Batches of cadres should be sent down as soon as the conditions are ripe, and the first batch of cadres should be sent down in November and December. This streamlining should emphasize that cadres sent down should go straight to the very bottom, and not be sent down layer by layer. Among the cadres sent down, a number of key members should be transferred to strengthen grassroots leadership in rural areas, cultural and educational fields, local industry, and financial and trade sectors. The vast majority of cadres should participate in production labor in production posts, mainly in agricultural production in rural areas. There should be a certain number of Party members, League members, and key personnel among the cadres sent down.

### 辽宁二十万干部将一放到底

    辽宁二十万干部将一放到底
    本报讯　辽宁省在明年4月以前将有二十万名左右的干部下放到基层，其中绝大部分将下乡、上山参加农业生产，部分人员将回到其他生产岗位或被抽调到农村、文教、地方工业、财经贸易等方面去加强基层领导力量。
    这是中共辽宁省委在10月底召开的市委、地委书记会议上决定的。会议根据三中全会的精神，对全省下放干部工作反复进行了讨论。会议认为一年来辽宁省虽然已经下放了一万七千多名干部，但是全省党政机关和企业、事业单位机构臃肿、层次重叠、人浮于事的现象仍旧非常严重。国家行政机关各级负责同志和工作人员均过多，其中很多工作人员又是没有经过斗争锻炼和考验，缺乏生产和工作经验的青年。而事业和企业单位中的问题尤为严重。全省国营厂矿企业的非生产人员（管理、服务人员）平均占36．2％，地方国营厂矿企业平均占26．7％，最高的竟达60％以上。商业系统一般的县1955年只有五、六个公司，基本上可以适应工作的需要，1956年却增加到十多个，管理、服务人员随着增加到占职工总人数的51．3％。大专学校教职员工同学生的比例有的几近一比一。这种现象不仅助长了主观主义和官僚主义的发展，影响工作效率的提高，妨碍着广大群众积极性的发挥，而且浪费了国家的人力、物力，也不利于干部的培养。
    针对上述情况，会议强调指出：必须在这次整风运动中以革命的精神、革命的办法，大刀阔斧地紧缩机构，抽调大批干部下放基层，充实到劳动战线上去。会议还认为，由于辽宁省的特点是工厂、矿山和企业多，因此，就全局来讲紧缩机构的重点应该放在企业和事业部门。各企业、事业部门的非生产人员一般要减少二分之一，多的要减少三分之二，少的也要不低于三分之一。紧缩机构以后，全省国营工业的管理人员占全体职工的比例，将由现在的18．6％降低到10．65％；地方国营工业的管理人员将由16．2％降低到9．03％。国家行政机关在原已紧缩编制16．3％的基础上，要求再紧缩10％以上；省级机关前后共将紧缩50％以上（已减30％）。会议指出：只要领导上有决心，充分发动群众，采取各种措施，上述指标是可以完成的。为了作好这项工作，各级党委必须加强领导，充分发动群众，在整风运动的第三阶段，采取大鸣大放大争的方式，掀起一个声势浩大的紧缩机构的运动。这个运动的总要求是：要快，要多，要好。应从现在起立即行动，争取在明年4月结束。要从上到下行动，高级机关的干部要首先下去，作出样子。条件成熟一批就下放一批，11、12月第一批干部就要下放。这次精简要强调下放干部一下子放到底，不能层层下放。在下放干部中，要抽调一部分骨干加强农村、文教、地方工业、财贸等方面的基层领导力量，绝大部分干部要到生产岗位上参加生产劳动，主要是到农村参加农业生产。下放干部中要有一定数量的党员、团员和骨干力量。
