Xinhua News Agency, 9th Dispatch from Amman: The situation in Jordan has recently become very tense. Mass demonstrations are increasing in major cities such as Amman, Irbid, Jerusalem, Jericho, Ramallah, and Nablus. In Amman, bloody clashes have occurred between Palestinian refugees and the police. In the western Jordanian cities, workers have held general strikes to protest new American plans aimed at turning Jordan into an American military base.

According to reports in Damascus newspapers, the military governor of the Jordanian sector of Jerusalem hastily led a large number of troops to Jericho to try to suppress the demonstrations, and then rushed from Jericho to Ramallah, where mass demonstrations were also taking place. All troops under the command of Nasser Jamil, uncle of King Hussein of Jordan, have been stationed around the Jordanian King's palace.

The Jordanian Parliament has not held any meetings since the vote of confidence due to a lack of a quorum. It is reported that two members of parliament are imprisoned, four are political exiles, two are working underground in Jordan, and the four members of the Muslim Brotherhood have decided not to attend any parliamentary meetings. Six members of parliament have jointly submitted their resignations.

According to Damascus newspapers, some Western journalists in the area have received instructions to travel to Jordan immediately to cover the news.

    议会由于不够法定人数无法开会
    新华社9日讯　安曼消息：约旦最近局势十分紧张。在安曼、伊尔比德、耶路撒冷、杰里科、拉马拉和纳布鲁斯等主要城镇，群众的示威游行愈来愈多。在安曼，巴勒斯坦难民和警察曾经发生了流血冲突。在约旦西部各城市，工人们举行了总罢工，抗议美国旨在变约旦为美国军事基地的新计划。
    据大马士革报纸消息，耶路撒冷约旦区的军事总督曾经率领大批部队匆忙赶到杰里科去设法镇压示威游行，随后又从杰里科赶到也发生群众游行示威的拉马拉去。在约旦国王侯赛因的叔父纳赛尔·贾米勒指挥下的全部军队都已经驻守在约旦国王王宫的周围。
    约旦议会在举行信任投票以后由于缺乏法定人数而没有举行任何会议。据悉，两名议员被囚禁在监狱中，四名议员是政治流亡者，两名议员在约旦从事地下工作，而穆斯林兄弟会的四名议员决定不参加任何议会会议。有六名议员联合提出了辞呈。
    据大马士革报纸消息说，当地的某些西方记者接到了要他们立即前往约旦采访新闻的指示。
