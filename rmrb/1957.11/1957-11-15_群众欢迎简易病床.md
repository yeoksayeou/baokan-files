    The Masses Welcome Simple Hospital Beds

    The Shangyi County Hospital in Hebei Province has twenty beds. In the past, the daily cost of hospitalization was five jiao per person. Some people who needed to be hospitalized often refused due to the high cost, which created many difficulties for treatment. In June of this year, the hospital conducted research to address these issues. Based on the spirit of saving money, providing convenience, and facilitating treatment for the masses, the hospital converted twelve of its original twenty beds into simple hospital beds to make hospitalization more accessible to the people. The simple hospital beds were equipped with straw mats and general necessities provided by the hospital, while other bedding, sheets, and pillows were brought by the patients themselves. The daily hospitalization fee was one jiao per person. With the establishment of simple hospital beds, the hospital also set two standards for meals: seven jiao and four jiao per person per day, allowing patients to choose according to their financial means. For patients who brought their own food, the hospital charged a small fee for coal and fire. The situation in the past four months has proven that simple hospital beds are economical and convenient, which the masses appreciate. Consequently, the number of people from rural areas being hospitalized has increased significantly, and the bed utilization rate has also improved. In the past, the masses who were hospitalized for treatment only accounted for 20% of the total number of hospitalized people. After the establishment of simple hospital beds, the masses hospitalized for treatment reached 60% of the total number of hospitalized patients. The masses praised the simple hospital beds, saying, "It doesn't cost much, and treatment is convenient."

    群众欢迎简易病床
    河北尚义县医院有病床二十张。过去住院费每人每日五角，有些需要住院治疗的群众，往往因为住院费负担大拒绝住院，给治疗上增加了许多困难。今年6月，该院针对这些问题进行了研究，根据群众住院省钱、方便和便于治疗的精神，把原有的二十张病床，分出十二张改为简易病床，便利群众住院。简易病床由医院设草褥和一般用具，其他被褥、床单和枕头等由病人自带，住院费每人每日一角。随着简易病床的设立，住院伙食也规定了每人每日七角和四角两种标准，由病人根据经济力量选择；自带食物由医院代作者，医院酌取煤火费。四个月来的情况证明，简易病床省钱方便，群众满意，因而来自农村住院的群众显著增多，病床使用率也提高了。过去住院治疗的群众只占住院总人数的20％，简易病床设立后，住院治疗的群众竟达到住院病人总数的60％，群众称赞简易病床“花钱不多，治疗方便”。
