    Introducing "The Wonderful Adventures of Nils"
  　Wang Yanling
    "The Wonderful Adventures of Nils" is a color animated art film adapted from the eponymous fairy tale by Swedish female writer Selma Lagerlöf. It tells the story of a very naughty boy named Nils, who, after meeting a gnome, is blamed and punished by the gnome for his insatiable demands, turning him into a person the size of a small bean. Soon, he rides on the back of his mother's favorite gander, Mårten Goose, and embarks on a wonderful and perilous aerial journey. During this extraordinary journey, he is educated and transformed into a brave, kind, and selfless good child, eventually earning the gnome's forgiveness and returning to his original form.
    This is a film of great educational significance for children. We sincerely hope that all children, their parents, and teachers will go and see it and gain some enlightenment from it.
    This is an animated film with dazzling colors and vivid shapes. Under the skillful brushstrokes of chief artist Millercis and others, the portrayal of characters' appearances and the expression of their thoughts and feelings, as well as the depiction of birds' movements and the scenery of plants and trees, are all wonderfully moving and ingenious! Coupled with colors that can enhance emotional changes and dramatic conflicts, and beautiful music that conforms to the development of the plot, it gives people a strong sense of life and beautiful artistic enjoyment.
    This animated film once again proves that this art form, which is not limited by the real activities of any natural object, is indeed a powerful tool for cultivating children's character and educating the masses. It is not only an excellent animated film, but also a collection of highly cultivated artistic creations. It is a sweet spring for children's hearts, and it is also a life subject that we all must constantly examine ourselves with.

    介绍“骑鹅旅行记”
  　王延陵
    “骑鹅旅行记”，是一部根据瑞典女作家谢里玛·拉格尔列芙的同名童话改编摄制的彩色动画艺术片。它叙述一个名叫尼勒斯的非常顽皮的孩子，在遇见地神以后，因为他的贪得无厌的要求，受到了地神的责难和惩罚，变成了一个像小豆一般大小的人。不久，他骑在他妈妈最心爱的公鹅玛尔金的背上，开始了一次奇妙的艰险的空中旅行。在这次奇异的旅行中，他受到了教育，转变成为一个勇敢、善良、舍己为人的好孩子，终于得到了地神的宽恕，恢复了原形。
    这是一部对儿童有很大教育意义的影片。我们衷心希望所有的孩子们和他们的爸爸妈妈、老师们，都去看看它，从它那里获得一些教益。
    这是一部色彩绚烂，造型生动的动画片。在总画师米勒契思等的妙笔下，对人物外貌的刻划和思想感情的发抒，对飞禽动态和草木景物的描绘，都是奇妙动人，巧夺天工！加上能够烘托情绪变化和戏剧冲突的色彩和符合于剧情发展的优美乐曲，使人感到了浓郁的生活气息和美好的艺术享受。
    这部美术片子也再一次地证明了这一种不受任何自然物象真实活动所局限的艺术形式，确实是陶冶儿童性格和教育群众的极有力量的工具。它不仅是一部优秀的动画影片，而且也是一部具有高度修养的美术创作集。它是孩子们心灵上的甘泉，它也是我们大家所必须时刻自省的生活课题。
