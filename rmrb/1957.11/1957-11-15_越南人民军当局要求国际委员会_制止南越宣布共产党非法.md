Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, November 14th: Colonel Ha Van Lau, head of the Liaison Delegation of the General Command of the People's Army of Vietnam, wrote to the International Commission on the 12th, opposing the South Vietnamese regime's preparation to pass a draft decree "declaring the Communist Party illegal."

In the letter, Ha Van Lau pointed out that the Internal Affairs, Justice, National Defense, and Foreign Affairs subcommittees of the South Vietnamese "National Assembly" studied this draft decree at a joint meeting on November 8. Moreover, in order to prepare public opinion, South Vietnamese newspapers have successively published news about the "Communist Party's subversive activities," urging the South Vietnamese "National Assembly" to pass this decree quickly. Some newspapers, such as "Northern News," even blatantly slandered that the International Commission had also sent people using the name of the International Commission to carry out "legal" communist activities in South Vietnam.

Ha Van Lau suggested that the International Commission take timely action to stop the South Vietnamese regime from legalizing its policy of terror and retaliation against former resistance fighters and those who support peaceful reunification.

    越南人民军当局要求国际委员会
    制止南越宣布共产党非法
    新华社河内14日电　越南人民军总司令部联络代表团团长何文楼上校12日写信给国际委员会，反对南越政权准备通过“宣布共产党非法”的法令草案。
    何文楼在信中指出，南越“国会”的内务、司法、国防、外交各小组委员会在11月8日的联席会议上研究了这项法令草案。并且，为了准备舆论，南越报纸接连发表关于“共产党的颠覆活动”的消息，催促南越“国会”赶快通过这个法令。有的报纸，如“北方消息”甚至还明目张胆地污蔑说，国际委员会也派了人利用国际委员会的名义在南越进行共产主义的“合法”活动。
    何文楼建议国际委员会及时采取行动，以制止南越政权把他们对前抗战人员和赞成和平统一的人士的恐怖和报复政策加以合法化。
