    A Brief Discussion on the Struggle of the Two Lines in China's Higher Education
    Li Yunyang
    In recent months, China's higher education community has experienced a great and fierce struggle. During this period, right-wing elements launched a large-scale attack on China's entire socialist system, carrying out a rampant offensive against China's higher education. They not only attacked many specific measures but also, on a series of line issues, put forward a complete set of bourgeois higher education proposals, comprehensively and fiercely attacking the socialist higher education line. In response to this offensive, the broad masses of teachers and students immediately rose up to counterattack and, under the leadership of the Party, launched a mass debate involving hundreds of thousands of teachers and students. Finally, the right-wing's conspiracy was crushed. This great debate proves that all higher education workers must clarify the essence and content of the struggle between the two lines in higher education and draw lessons from it in order to achieve a complete victory in this struggle and to defend and develop China's socialist higher education.
    The basic principles of socialist higher education are essentially incompatible with those of bourgeois higher education.
    Our higher education line is to cultivate worker-class intellectuals who have socialist consciousness and a high level of modern science and culture, who are physically sound, who have both specialized knowledge and skills and basic physical labor training, who are willing to integrate with workers and peasants, who maintain the spirit of hard work, simplicity, and heroic struggle of our revolutionary tradition, and who are willing to serve the people wholeheartedly. To this end, higher education must, under the leadership of the working class, take Marxism-Leninism as the guide for all work, unite the broad masses of higher education workers, and wage a struggle against all kinds of bourgeois ideology in order to establish a higher education system that is adapted to the needs of socialist construction and combined with China's actual conditions. The essence of the bourgeois higher education line is to establish a system led by bourgeois ideology, modeled on the higher education systems of American and British universities, and to cultivate senior intellectuals who serve the interests of the bourgeoisie.
    The socialist higher education line includes the following main principles:
    The leadership of the working class (its concentrated expression is the leadership of the Communist Party) and the guidance of Marxist thought are the soul of higher education. The leadership of the working class is the decisive link that determines the nature of all aspects of our lives. In this sense, China's higher education has been able to transform into a socialist nature since the founding of the country in 1949. However, higher education is a cause engaged in various scientific and cultural educations, and its ideological guidance has its own particular importance. Socialist higher education must realize the ideological guidance of Marxism and Leninism and implement it in all aspects of higher education. The ideological guidance of Marxism-Leninism in universities is certainly an important component of Marxist-Leninist political theory courses, but this ideological guidance is also embodied in the policies and principles of higher education, in academic thought (which is concretized in teaching plans, teaching syllabuses, textbooks, and lectures), and also in the struggle against various bourgeois ideological tendencies. It can be seen that the ideological guidance of Marxism is pervasive in all aspects of the school and has a decisive importance. The ideological guidance of Marxism must be realized through the Communist Party's concrete leadership of school work and through the ideological and political struggle against the bourgeoisie. Therefore, the Party's leadership is the most important guarantee of the socialist higher education line. The right-wing elements, as representatives of the bourgeois higher education line, are well aware of this. They used all kinds of vicious means to try to vilify our Party, isolate the Party, and then put forward the reactionary demand for the Communist Party to withdraw from the schools. In order to eliminate the Party's leadership, they put forward the fallacy that laymen cannot lead experts, advocated professorial governance and democratic governance, advocated abolishing personnel departments and opening up archival materials. They advocated abolishing the four political courses, restoring bourgeois sociology; they opposed the various movements led by the Party, exaggerating shortcomings and negating achievements, especially slandering the ideological remolding movement, believing that it had destroyed intellectuals, and slandering the anti-rebellion movement, believing that it intentionally framed good people; they fabricated facts, insisting that Party members enjoyed privileges, saying that the Party's leadership was the root of sectarianism, and that Marxism-Leninism was the root of dogmatism. They even launched a comprehensive attack on the entire socialist system, attempting to replace the Party's leadership with the leadership of the rightists, and to replace Marxist-Leninist thought with bourgeois thought.
    The policy of planned cultivation of advanced construction talents according to the needs of socialist construction is also a component of the socialist higher education line that is adapted to the economic laws of socialist society. It is embodied in higher education career plans, school layouts, professional settings, and training goals. This principle determines the necessity of departmental adjustments, the uniformity of teaching plans, and the necessity of setting up specialized courses in the teaching plan that are coordinated with national construction, in addition to emphasizing basic courses. This is in direct opposition to the theories and contents of the bourgeois higher education line, such as free competition, free teaching, genius education, and general education. The right-wing elements opposed departmental adjustments, advocating free schooling; advocating running American-style universities of science and technology; opposing teaching reforms, opposing unified teaching plans and outlines, advocating free lecturing, advocating not having specialized courses, only the curriculum of basic theoretical courses; opposing unified allocation, advocating free choice of profession. In this way, they undermined the principle of planned cultivation of socialist construction talents according to needs in the socialist higher education line.
    Comprehensive development of moral, intellectual, and physical education is also a component of the socialist higher education line and is a guiding ideology that must be implemented in all aspects of the education system, content, and methods. This policy is embodied in the requirements for training cadres in terms of morality (socialist consciousness, spirit of serving the people), intelligence (modern cultural and scientific level), and physical education (sound physique), and is also embodied in the combination of mental and physical labor, and labor education with physical labor as the basis of mental labor. It is directly opposed to the bourgeois line of despising physical labor, despising workers and peasants, and cultivating superior people who serve the bourgeois rulers.
    Cultivating worker-class intellectuals is a principle of the socialist higher education line. Capitalist countries deceive the people with an attitude of being above class, boasting that all citizens have the right to receive higher education, but in fact, what their universities cultivate are only the children of the bourgeoisie. However, in socialist countries, the broad masses of workers and peasants not only have the possibility of receiving higher education, but this is precisely the purpose of our socialist higher education. We must systematically absorb the children of workers and peasants into schools in various ways and help them overcome the difficulties of entering school, such as vigorously establishing worker-peasant middle schools, giving priority to students from worker-peasant backgrounds, holding various tutoring classes, and various forms of spare-time education; at the same time, we must also transform students from non-worker-peasant families into socialist intellectuals.
    Paying attention to the development of higher education for ethnic minorities and vigorously cultivating advanced intellectuals of ethnic minorities. This is also a major component of our line. This is inseparable from the socialist national policy. In recent years, we have taken care of the characteristics of ethnic minorities and used all possible methods to ensure the development of higher education for ethnic minorities. In the 1956-1957 academic year, there were 14,159 ethnic minority students in school, an increase of nearly tenfold compared with 1950, but the right-wing elements are doing their best to undermine this policy.
    The teaching policy of linking theory with practice. It directly opposes the old-style school's "dead reading, reading dead books, studying to death" training method of theory being divorced from practice, and at the same time opposes that kind of shortsighted pragmatism that only pays attention to narrow utility and despises the cultivation of theoretical foundations. It requires that in the process of training students, there should be a clear political purpose, opposing that kind of purely professional viewpoint that only teaches books and not people, only regards courses as knowledge to be imparted, and does not combine the struggle with nature, class struggle, and the students' ideological reality. The right-wing elements are doing their best to oppose this policy. They call for satisfying the requirements of "one room, two books" so that the vast majority of teachers can be separated from political ideological struggles and the practice of national socialist construction, advocating abolishing production internships and graduation designs and other teaching methods that are closely linked to practice.
    As mentioned above, it can be seen that the basic principles of our higher education are essentially incompatible with the principles of bourgeois higher education. These principles are what the bourgeois rightists want to destroy quickly and replace with bourgeois principles.
    The bourgeois higher education line is concentratedly expressed in the draft opinions on scientific planning proposed by Zeng Zhaolun, Qian Weichang, and others on June 9, and the draft plan for the leadership system of universities proposed by Huang Yaomian and Wu Jingchao. The former stipulated the political direction for the bourgeois higher education line. In this document, they did not want the leadership of the Party, did not want the guidance of Marxism-Leninism, did not want to serve socialism, and restored bourgeois sociology. The latter stipulated the organizational direction for usurping the leadership of the working class. In this document, they proposed that Party member principals not participate in the school affairs committee, the highest power decision-making body, and restricted the Party's power to only guarantee material equipment for them and do empty ideological work, that is, to use the Party as a service member for the right-wing elements. Following these two major programs, there are also specific plans for each part: such as Chen Zhenhan's reactionary economics program, Chen Da's program for restoring the old sociology, and Qian Duansheng's grand law school program. In this way, a complete set of goods from theory to program and plan is precisely the embodiment of the restoration conspiracy of the bourgeois higher education line.
    Of course, just as the Chinese bourgeoisie can never establish its independent regime in politics, if we follow the higher education line proposed by these right-wing elements, what can appear is only a replica of the higher education of the past colonies and semi-colonies.
    Refuting several fallacies of the right-wing elements' attack on the socialist higher education line
    The spearhead of the right-wing elements' attack on the socialist higher education line is mainly directed at the Party's leadership in universities. In order to prove that laymen cannot lead experts and that the Party cannot lead universities, they distorted the facts, saying that higher education has been ruined since liberation, everything is "chaos, mess, bias," departmental adjustments are unnecessary, teaching reforms have no achievements, learning from the Soviet Union only brought dogmatism, the Party did not implement the policy of intellectuals in universities, and so on. In order to adhere to the socialist higher education line, we must refute it based on facts.
    First of all, has higher education improved or deteriorated under the leadership of the Party in recent years? This is an important issue in the great debate. We believe that from the following facts, it has improved, not deteriorated, and the Party is capable of leading higher education.
      Looking at the speed of development, in the past seven years (1949-1956), we have cultivated a total of 302,514 graduates, which is much more than the total number of 210,827 graduates in the 36 years before liberation (1912-1947). Without the vast number of cadres cultivated in these years, it would be difficult to carry out large-scale construction projects. The right-wing elements said that this is only from the perspective of quantity, and the most important thing in education is quality, and the quality of students has declined in recent years. Has our quality really declined? When it comes to judging quality standards, we have fundamental differences with the representatives of the bourgeois higher education line. The quality we are talking about is first of all the political quality of the students. We believe that this is the decisive condition in the issue of quality, while the right-wing elements are extremely opposed to this. They put forward the fallacy of "talent is virtue" and "having talent is having virtue," and put forward an indiscriminate and inflammatory demand. This is because they know that if the political quality requirement of serving the people wholeheartedly is canceled, it is equivalent to allowing the open and legal status of bourgeois ideology. In this way, the task of cultivating the working class's own intellectuals is fundamentally negated. We believe that starting from the characteristics of socialist society and the nature of socialist higher education, our education work is to give a small number of students with higher talents the opportunity to develop on the basis of ensuring the universal improvement of the quality of the vast majority of students; while the quality viewpoint of the bourgeois genius educationists is inseparable from the characteristics of bourgeois society. It is to sacrifice the quality of the majority and only focus on cultivating a small number of "geniuses." Starting from our quality viewpoint, we believe that the teaching quality of each department and the learning results of students are generally improved to varying degrees compared with the pre-war period, especially in the aspect of linking theory with practice and in political quality, it is even more significant.
    After liberation, after departmental adjustments, 215 majors were set up in universities across the country. This method of cultivating talents according to majors is a huge change in quality compared with the old method of cultivating talents according to departments. In order to adapt to the new achievements of science and technology and the urgent needs of national construction, 98 new majors have been added in three years, and more new specializations and new courses have been opened. Taking Peking University as an example, after the adjustment of departments, by 1956, a total of 86 new basic courses and 107 new specialized courses had been opened. The same phenomenon exists in various schools. And our unified teaching plan precisely embodies this quality viewpoint. It is different from the old university's irresponsible free lecturing, free course selection, and free elimination methods, but guarantees that most students meet certain specifications with strict teaching links and teaching methods, and at the same time gives talented students the opportunity to develop. It enables advanced schools to play a leading role and also promotes the relatively backward schools to have a fighting goal, so that the level of each school is gradually improved; unlike in old China, where the level of each school varied too much.
    As for comparing the current level of some students with the pre-war period in isolation, leaving aside the impact of the long-term war environment on primary and secondary schools and the large-scale enrollment due to the needs of national construction, resulting in a shortage of high school students, the unreasonableness is even more obvious. In short, it is necessary to comprehensively and seriously combine national needs and the characteristics of socialist society and check the quality of our graduates in work practice. However, the purpose of the right-wing elements in discussing quality issues from a bourgeois perspective is nothing more than to completely negate the achievements of our socialist higher education, so as to prove that the restoration of bourgeois higher education is a reasonable requirement.
    In the first few years after liberation, we founded many new schools, such as Renmin University of China, Harbin Institute of Technology, and Northeast People's University, which were almost built from scratch. In these schools, through arduous efforts in just a few years, not only have students of a higher level been cultivated in teaching, but also certain achievements have been made in scientific research. As for the original universities, even schools in remote areas with more difficult conditions, have made great progress in recent years. This is also an example of the Party's ability to lead higher education well.
    Second, the right-wing elements especially attacked the departmental adjustments, because the departmental adjustments destroyed the old higher education organizational system, disrupted the right-wing elements' camps at that time, and dismantled the strongholds they had set up to usurp leadership. Therefore, as early as 1950, right-wing small groups such as Zhang Dongsun and Zeng Zhaolun held meetings to oppose departmental adjustments. In 1951, Qian Weichang colluded with Fei Xiaotong to propose a so-called Daqinghua adjustment plan, which hindered the progress of departmental adjustment work. After their conspiracy to sabotage was shamefully defeated, they wantonly slandered this work, saying that we cut off historical traditions, messed up matchmaking, etc., trying to overthrow the new university system and restore the appearance of the old universities before the departmental adjustments.
    But what was the setting of higher education before the departmental adjustments? According to the statistics of 1947-1948, the students of political and legal departments accounted for 24.3% of the total number of university students at that time, finance and economics accounted for 11.45%, while engineering students only accounted for 17.82%. This situation basically did not change significantly by 1952. Before the departmental adjustments in 1952, there were more than 70 universities with finance and economics departments and nearly 100 with political and legal departments, while 57.5% of the country's universities and 61.4% of the students were concentrated in coastal cities. Taking Shanghai as an example, when Shanghai was liberated in 1949, there were a total of 41 universities, 30 of which were private, and 6 of which were run by churches. At that time, there were a total of 20,200 students, of which 64.25% were studying in private schools.
    This situation was in line with the semi-colonial and semi-feudal political economy of old China in the past, but it was extremely inconsistent with the needs of socialist construction, which is why departmental adjustments had to be carried out. Shortly after the departmental adjustments, 39 multi-discipline and single-discipline colleges of engineering were established. In 1953, the enrollment quota for engineering expanded to 41.9% of the total, and teacher training accounted for 24.8%. The phenomenon of higher education being excessively concentrated in coastal areas has also gradually changed. At present, new higher education centers have gradually formed in industrial bases such as Northeast China, Xi'an, Wuhan, and Chengdu. Universities in ethnic minority areas such as Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, and Yanbian, which had almost no universities in the past, have also been gradually established and developed. In this way, a new layout of universities suitable for the needs of socialist construction has been gradually established. In such a large-scale adjustment, shortcomings are inevitable. For example, insufficient consideration for the historical traditions of individual schools, merging or separating some departments too early, and excessive requirements for uniformity in the setting of departments have caused some losses to the work, but compared to the hundreds of thousands of cadres who have been cultivated in recent years, ensuring the needs of cadres in all aspects of national socialist construction, these shortcomings are obviously secondary.
    Third, the right-wing elements strongly opposed the policy of learning from the Soviet Union in teaching reform. Qian Weichang even reversed black and white, saying that higher education in old China was never dogmatic, as if only learning from the Soviet Union after teaching reform brought dogmatism. But the achievements of teaching reform in recent years have fully proved the superiority of Soviet experience. In recent years, the formulation of teaching plans and syllabuses, the opening of new majors and courses, and the implementation of various teaching links have been inseparable from learning from the Soviet Union. More importantly, we have learned the socialist principles and spirit of higher education in the Soviet Union, such as emphasizing the cultivation of students' complete dialectical materialist world outlook in all courses, cultivating cadres in a planned and proportional manner, attaching importance to the growth of workers and peasants, actively developing spare-time higher education, emphasizing specialization and specialization on a broad theoretical basis, adhering to the teaching policy of linking theory with practice, paying attention to experimental production internships, graduation designs and graduation theses, and advocating giving full play to everyone's expertise under the leadership of the Party, and conducting collectivist teaching in a planned manner. Due to the implementation of these principles, not only has the face of higher education in our country fundamentally changed, but it has also revealed to the vast majority of teachers in our country concrete examples of how to conduct ideological remolding in conjunction with professional work.
    In learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, our shortcoming is that we have not combined it with China's situation enough. This is mainly because there is still some dogmatism in our learning methods, we have not studied the situation of socialist construction and class struggle in our country at this stage enough, and we have not paid enough attention to the different situations and conditions of various regions, schools, and the vast number of teachers and students. We have neither summarized the experience of revolutionary education in the liberated areas well, nor have we seriously analyzed and criticized higher education in old China. Therefore, when learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, some places failed to digest it well in combination with our reality.
    Fourth, regarding the policy of cultivating teachers and implementing the policy of intellectuals. Since the establishment of the Ministry of Higher Education in 1953, it has repeatedly and clearly put forward the policy of cultivating teachers: vigorously cultivate new teachers, improve the level of existing teachers, do a good job in uniting new and old teachers, and implement the policy of uniting and transforming intellectuals. By implementing this policy, great achievements have been made in recent years. 42,287 new teachers have been added, an increase of 3.3 times compared with the number of teachers in 1949. Old teachers have also been equipped with a certain number of assistants, and the conditions for teaching and scientific research, such as equipment and books, have also been greatly improved compared with the Kuomintang era. Among them, 103 were elected as deputies to the National People's Congress, and 68 were elected as members of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. Among the old teachers of the 75 universities directly under the Ministry of Higher Education, 95 were promoted to presidents and deans. These are all expressions of the Party and the government's trust and respect for senior intellectuals. But the right-wing elements obliterated these facts and distorted the Party's policy on intellectuals, wantonly slandering us.
    From the facts revealed after the anti-rightist struggle, it seems that there are indeed shortcomings and lessons in our implementation of this policy, that is: it was right to believe in the progress of the vast majority of teachers in the past, but as a result of our attaching more importance to professional work and neglecting political and ideological leadership, some work has the shortcomings of more unity and less transformation, more accommodation and less serious education. As a result, the phenomenon of lax labor discipline has appeared in universities in recent years. Many right-wing elements are taking high salaries but not doing work, and even using this spare time to carry out activities everywhere to attack the Party. Also due to the above-mentioned shortcomings, more attention is paid to the professional scientific level of senior intellectuals, while less attention is paid to their political and ideological performance.
    In this way, the main link in the work of cultivating and improving teachers has essentially been relaxed, making us negligent in the political and ideological struggle, which is not conducive to the struggle against bourgeois ideology in universities, and this is something we should deeply remember. This anti-rightist struggle proves that the saying that "relying on old teachers to run schools well" that was popular in the past is not comprehensive and clear enough. It should be said that under the leadership of the Party, relying on progressive teachers, students, and staff, especially progressive teachers, uniting the vast majority of higher education workers, and opposing the bourgeois higher education ideology can run schools well.

    略论我国高等教育的两条路线的斗争
    李云扬
    近几月来我国高等教育界已经历了一场伟大的激烈的斗争，在这一时期右派分子对我国整个社会主义制度大举出击，向我国高等教育事业进行了猖狂的进攻。他们不仅在许多具体措施上，而且就一系列路线问题上，提出了资产阶级高等教育的一整套主张，全面地猛烈地攻击社会主义的高等教育路线。对于这个进攻，广大师生立即起而反击，并在党的领导下展开了有几十万师生参加的群众性的大辩论。最后终于粉碎了右派的阴谋。这次大辩论证明所有的高教工作者必须明确高等教育两条路线斗争的实质与内容，从中吸取经验教训，才能取得这个斗争的彻底胜利，才能保卫和发展我国社会主义的高等教育。
    社会主义的高等教育的基本原则在本质上是与资产阶级高等教育原则不可并存的
    我们高等教育的路线是要培养具有社会主义觉悟和近代科学文化高度水平，体魄健全的工人阶级的知识分子。这种知识分子既有专门知识技能，又有体力劳动的基本锻炼，愿意与工农打成一片，保持着我们革命传统的艰苦朴素英勇奋斗的精神，愿意全心全意为人民服务。为此，高等教育就必须在工人阶级领导下，以马克思列宁主义思想为一切工作的指南，团结广大的高等教育工作者，向各式各样的资产阶级思想进行斗争，以建立适应于社会主义建设需要的，和中国实际情况相结合的高等教育体系。而资产阶级高等教育路线的实质是要建立以资产阶级思想为领导的，以美、英高等学校的高等教育体系为榜样，培养为资产阶级利益服务的高级知识分子。
    社会主义的高等教育路线包括有如下的主要原则：
    工人阶级的领导（其集中的表现就是共产党的领导）与马克思主义思想指导是高等教育的灵魂。工人阶级的领导是决定我国生活各方面的性质的决定性的一环。从这意义上说来，我国的高等教育自1949年建国以来，就已经有可能转化为社会主义性质的了。但是高等教育是从事各种科学和文化教育的事业，它的思想指导更有其特殊的重要性。社会主义高等教育必须实现马克思主义的思想指导，在高等学校的一切方面加以贯彻。高等学校中马列主义的思想指导固然是以马列主义政治理论课为重要构成部分，但是这种思想指导还体现在高等教育的方针政策、学术思想上（又具体化于教学计划、教学大纲、教科书与讲义中），还体现在向各种资产阶级思想倾向进行斗争上。由此可见，马克思主义思想指导在高等学校中是贯通于学校的一切方面，有决定一切的重要性。而马克思主义思想指导又必须通过共产党对学校工作的具体领导，经过反对资产阶级的思想斗争与政治斗争才能实现。因此，党的领导就是社会主义高等教育路线最重要的保证。作为资产阶级高等教育路线的代表者的右派分子，对这一点是十分清楚的。他们用一切恶毒手段意图丑化我们的党，使党孤立起来，然后提出共产党退出学校的反动要求。他们为了排除党的领导提出所谓外行不能领导内行的谬论，主张教授治校、民主治校、主张取消人事处，公开档案材料，他们主张取消四门政治课，恢复资产阶级的社会学；他们反对党所领导的历次运动，夸大缺点，否定成绩，特别是污蔑思想改造运动，认为是摧残了知识分子，诬蔑肃反运动，认为有意陷害好人；他们捏造事实，硬说党团员享受特权，说党的领导是宗派主义的根源，马列主义是教条主义的根源，甚至对整个社会主义制度展开全面的进攻，企图以右派的领导代替党的领导，以资产阶级的思想代替马列主义思想。
    有计划地按社会主义建设的需要来培养高级建设人才的方针，也是与社会主义社会的经济规律相适应的社会主义高等教育路线的一个构成部分。它体现在高等教育事业计划、学校布局、专业设置和培养目标上。这一条原则决定了院系调整的必要性、教学计划的统一性和教学计划中除强调基础课外，必须设置和国家建设需要相配合的专业课。这一条是直接反对自由竞争、自由教学、天才教育与通才教育等等资产阶级高等教育路线的理论与内容的。右派分子反对院系调整，主张自由办学；主张办美国式的理工大学；反对教学改革，反对统一教学计划与大纲，主张自由讲学，主张不要专业课，只要基础理论课的课程表；反对统一分配，主张自由选择职业。这样他们就破坏了社会主义高等教育路线的有计划按需要的培养社会主义建设人才的原则了。
    德育、智育、体育全面发展，也是社会主义高等教育路线的组成部分，并且是要贯彻到教育制度、内容和方法各方面去的指导思想。这条方针体现在德（社会主义的觉悟，为人民服务的精神）、智（近代的文化科学水平）、体（健全的体魄）等培养干部规格要求上，也体现于脑力劳动与体力劳动的结合，脑力劳动应以体力劳动为基础的劳动教育上。它是与资产阶级的轻视体力劳动，轻视工农，培养为资产阶级统治者服务的人上人的路线直接对立着的。
    培养工人阶级知识分子是社会主义高等教育路线的一个原则。资本主义国家以超阶级的姿态欺骗人民，夸耀所有公民都有受高等教育的权利，其实他们高等学校里所培养的只是资产阶级的子弟。但是在社会主义的国家中则广大工农群众不仅有受高等教育的可能，而且这正是我们社会主义高等教育的目的。我们要有计划地以各种方式吸收工农子弟入学，并帮助他们克服入学的困难，例如大力创办工农中学、对工农成份的学生实行优先录取、举办各种补习班、各种业余教育；同时还要把非工农家庭出身的学生改造成为社会主义的知识分子。
    注意发展少数民族的高等教育，大力培养少数民族的高级知识分子。这也是我们路线的主要内容。这是与社会主义的民族政策不可分的。几年来我们照顾了少数民族的特点，尽可能地用一切方法保证发展少数民族的高等教育事业，1956—1957学年在校少数民族学生已有一万四千一百五十九人，比1950年增加了将近十倍，但是右派分子对于这一方针是竭力破坏的。
    理论联系实际的教学方针。它直接反对旧式学校的理论脱离实际的“死读书、读死书、读书死”的培养方式，同时也反对那种只讲究狭隘的实用，而轻视理论基础培养的近视的实用主义。它要求在训练学生的过程中，应有明确的政治目的性，反对那种只教书不教人，只把课程当为知识去传授，而不结合自然斗争、阶级斗争和学生思想实际的单纯业务观点。右派分子是竭力反对这一方针的。他们号召满足“一间房、两本书”的要求，以便使广大教师脱离政治思想斗争，脱离国家社会主义建设的实践，主张取消生产实习与毕业设计等等密切联系实际的教学方式。
    如上所述，可见我们的高等教育的基本原则在本质上是与资产阶级高等教育原则不可并存。这些原则都是资产阶级右派分子欲摧毁之而后快，欲以资产阶级的原则取而代之的。
    资产阶级高等教育路线集中地表现在6月9日曾昭抡、钱伟长等所提出的科学规划意见草案和黄药眠、吴景超所提出的高等学校领导体制草案中。前者为资产阶级高等教育路线规定了政治方向，在这个文件中，他们不要党的领导，不要马克思列宁主义思想指导，不要为社会主义服务，复辟资产阶级社会学。而后者则为篡夺工人阶级领导规定了组织方向，在这个文件中，他们提出了党员校长不能参加最高权力决策机关的校务委员会，并把党的权力限制在只能为他们保证物质设备，做做空洞思想工作，也就是说把党当为右派分子的勤务员来使用。紧跟着这两大纲领之后，还有各部分的具体方案：如陈振汉等的反动的经济学方案，陈达等的恢复旧社会学的方案，钱端升的大法学院方案等。这样从理论到纲领、方案一套齐全的货色，正是资产阶级高等教育路线的复辟阴谋的具体化。
    当然，正如在政治上中国的资产阶级绝不可能建立其独立的政权一样，照这些右派分子所提出的高等教育路线走下去，能出现的只是过去殖民地、半殖民地高等教育的翻版。
    驳斥右派分子进攻社会主义高等教育路线的几点谬论
    右派分子对社会主义高等教育路线进攻的矛头，主要是指向高等学校中党的领导。为了证明外行不能领导内行，党不能领导高等学校，他们歪曲事实，说解放以来高等教育是搞坏了，一切都是“乱、糟、偏”，院系调整是不必要的，教学改革是没有成绩的，学习苏联只是学来了教条主义，党在高等学校并没有执行知识分子政策等等。为了坚持社会主义高等教育路线，我们必须根据事实予以驳斥。
    首先，几年来高等教育在党的领导下是搞好了还是搞坏了？这是大争论中的一个重要问题。我们以为从以下事实看来是搞好了，而不是搞坏了，党是能够领导高等教育的。
      从发展的速度看，七年来（1949—1956年）我们培养的毕业生共有三十万零二千五百一十四名，比解放前三十六年（1912—1947年）的毕业生总数二十一万零八百二十七名还超过很多。没有这几年所培养出来的广大干部，就很难进行大规模的建设事业。右派分子说，这只是从数量上来看，教育工作最重要的是质量，这几年来学生的质量是下降了。我们的质量是否真的下降了呢？谈到判别质量的标准，我们与资产阶级高等教育路线的代表者有根本的分歧。我们所说的质量首先就是学生的政治质量。我们认为这是在质量问题上带决定性的条件，而右派则对此极端反对。他们提出“才即是德”“有才即有德”的谬论，并提出一视同仁的带煽动性的要求。这是因为他们知道如果取消了全心全意为人民服务的政治质量要求，也就等于允许资产阶级思想公开合法的地位。这样，就从根本上否定了培养工人阶级自己的知识分子的任务。我们认为从社会主义社会的特点和社会主义高等教育性质出发，我们的教育工作是要在保证绝大多数学生的普遍提高质量的基础上给少数天分较高的学生以发展的机会；而资产阶级的天才教育论者的质量观点却是与资产阶级社会的特性不可分的，它是要牺牲大多数人的质量，而只专心于培养少数“天才”，从我们的质量观点出发，我们认为各科系教学质量与学生学习成果一般比之战前已有不同程度的提高，特别在理论联系实际方面及政治质量上更为显著。
    解放后，经过院系调整，在全国高等学校设置了二百一十五种专业。这种按专业培养人才的办法，较之旧的按系科培养人才的办法是一个质量上极大的变化。为了适应科学技术的新成就和国家建设的迫切需要，在三年内增设了九十八种新专业，新设的专门化及新开课程则更多。以北京大学来说，在院系调整后，到1956年为止，新开的基础课程共有八十六门，新开的专门化课程共有一百零七门。各校都有同样的现象。而我们的统一的教学计划，也正是体现了这种质量观点。它与旧的高等学校不负责任的自由讲学、自由选课、自由淘汰的办法不同，而是以严格的教学环节、教学方法保证大部分学生合乎一定的规格，同时又给有才能的学生以发展的机会。它使先进学校能起带头作用，又促使了比较落后的学校有了奋斗的目标，使各校的水平，逐渐提高；而不像旧中国那样，各校水平相差太远。
    至于离开了过去长期战争环境对中小学的影响和由于国家建设需要而大量招生，以致高中生供不应求等情况，而孤立地拿目前一些学生水平与抗战前相比较，其不合理处更显而易见。总之，全面地、认真地结合国家需要和社会主义社会的特点，在工作实践中来检查我们毕业生的质量，那是应该的。但像右派分子那样以资产阶级的眼光谈质量问题，其目的不外是要全盘否定我们社会主义高等教育的成绩，借以证明资产阶级高等教育复辟是合理的要求而已。
    解放后几年内我们创办了很多新学校，其中如中国人民大学、哈尔滨工业大学、东北人民大学等，几乎都是从无到有地建设起来的。这些学校都是在短短的几年中，经过艰苦努力，不仅在教学上培养了较高水平的学生，并且在科学研究上也取得一定的成绩。至于原有的大学，甚至边远地区条件比较困难的学校，近几年来都有飞跃进步。这也是党是能领导好高等教育的一个例证。
    第二，右派分子特别攻击院系调整，因为院系调整破坏了旧的高等教育的组织体系，也打乱了当时右派分子的营垒，拆散了他们为篡夺领导权而安下的据点。因此早在1950年张东荪、曾昭抡等右派小集团就曾开会反对院系调整，1951年，钱伟长又与费孝通勾结一起提出所谓大清华的调整方案，使院系调整工作的进行受到阻碍。而在他们的破坏阴谋遭到可耻的失败以后，他们更肆意诬蔑这一工作，说我们割断历史传统，乱点鸳鸯谱，等等，企图推翻新的高等学校体系，恢复院系调整前旧大学的面貌。
    但是院系调整前的高等学校的设置是怎样的呢？据1947—1948年的统计，当时政法系科的学生占大学生总数的24．3％，财经占11．45％，而工科学生仅占17．82％。这种情况到了1952年基本上无重大改变。1952年院系调整前，设有财经院系的高等学校有七十余所，设有政法系科的近一百所，而当时全国的高等学校有57．5％，学生有61．4％都集中在沿海城市。即以上海一地而言，1949年解放的时候，上海共有四十一所高等学校，私立的占三十所，其中六所是教会办的。当时共有学生二万零二百人，其中64．25％是在私立学校里学习的。
    这种情况是与过去旧中国的半殖民地半封建的政治经济相适应的，但对社会主义建设需要则极不相称，这就是不能不进行院系调整的原因。院系调整后不久即创立了三十九所多科和单科性的工学院，1953年招生名额，工科扩大到占总数41．9％，师范占24．8％，高等学校过分集中在沿海的现象也逐渐有所改变。目前在东北、西安、武汉、成都等工业基地都已逐渐形成新的高等教育中心。过去几乎全无高等学校的新疆、内蒙古、延边等少数民族地区的高等学校也逐渐地建立和发展了起来。这样就逐步地建立了适合于社会主义建设的需要的高等学校的新布局。在这样大规模的调整中，缺点是在所不免的。例如对个别学校的历史传统照顾不够，对一些系科合并或独立过早和院系设置过分要求整齐划一等等，都给工作带来一些损失，但是比之几年来培养了几十万干部，保证了国家社会主义建设的各方面的干部需要来说，这些缺点显然是次要的。
    第三，右派分子极力反对在教学改革中学习苏联的方针。钱伟长甚至颠倒黑白地说旧中国高等教育从来就不是教条主义的，好像只有教学改革后学习苏联才带来了教条主义。但这几年来教学改革的成就已充分证明苏联经验的优越性。几年来教学计划、教学大纲的制定，新的专业、课程的开设和各种教学环节的推行，都是与学习苏联不可分的，而更其重要的是我们学习了苏联高等教育中的社会主义原则精神，如在各门课程中都强调培养学生的完整的辩证唯物主义世界观的精神，有计划按比例的培养干部，重视工农成份的增长，积极发展业余高等教育，强调在广阔理论基础上进行专业、专门化，坚持理论联系实际的教学方针，重视实验、生产实习、毕业设计与毕业论文等教学环节，主张在党的领导下充分发挥各人专长，有计划地进行集体主义教学等等。由于贯彻这些原则，不仅根本改变了我国高等教育的面貌，而且也为我国广大教师启示了如何结合业务进行思想改造的具体范例。
    在学习苏联先进经验方面，我们的缺点是结合中国情况不够。这主要是由于我们的学习方法中还存在若干教条主义，对我国现阶段的社会主义建设及阶级斗争的情况研究的不够，对各地区各学校及广大师生的不同情况与条件注意不足。既未很好地总结解放区的革命教育的经验，又未认真地对旧中国的高等教育进行分析与批判。因而在学习苏联先进经验时，有些地方未能很好结合我们的实际将它消化。
    第四，关于培养师资的政策与执行知识分子政策问题。自1953年高等教育部成立以来，多次明确地提出了培养师资的方针是大力培养新师资，提高现有的师资水平，搞好新老教师的团结，贯彻团结改造知识分子的政策。执行这个方针，几年来取得了很大的成绩，补充了新师资四万二千二百八十七人，比1949年教师数增加三点三倍。老教师也配备了一定数量的助手，进行教学和科学研究所需的设备、图书等条件，也较国民党时代有巨大的改善。他们中被选为全国人民代表的共有一百零三名，被选为全国政协委员的共有六十八名。高等教育部直属的七十五所高等学校的老教师中被提拔为校院长的共有九十五名。这些都是党和政府对高级知识分子信任尊重的表现。但是右派分子抹杀这些事实，歪曲党的知识分子政策，对我们肆意诬蔑。
    从反右派斗争以后揭发出的事实看来，我们在执行这政策上确也存在着缺点与教训，那就是：过去相信广大教师的进步这一点是对的，但由于我们重视业务多，对政治思想领导比较忽视的结果，在一些工作中有团结多，改造少，迁就多，严肃教育少的缺点。因而在高等学校近年来出现了劳动纪律松弛的现象。不少右派分子都是拿着高薪，但不做工作，甚至利用这空闲到处活动向党进攻。也是由于上述的缺点，因而对高级知识分子比较重视他们的业务科学水平，而对他们的政治思想的表现注意较少。
    这样，实质上是放松了培养提高师资工作中的主要环节，使我们在政治思想斗争中麻痹大意，不利于在高等学校中反对资产阶级思想的斗争，这一点是值得我们深深记取的。这次反右派斗争证明：过去曾流行着一句所谓“依靠老教师办好学校”的说法，是不够全面和明确的，应该说在党的领导下，依靠进步的师生员工特别是进步的教师，团结广大的高等教育工作者，反对资产阶级的高等教育思想才能把学校办好。
