The Nutritional Value of Persimmons

Persimmons are an economical and delicious fruit. Persimmons contain some minerals—calcium, phosphorus, potassium—as well as Vitamin A and Vitamin C.

In persimmons, Vitamin A exists in the form of carotene. If our bodies lack Vitamin A, our eyes are prone to dryness, our skin becomes dry and rough, and our body's resistance weakens, making us especially susceptible to colds and flu in winter. If our diet lacks Vitamin C, we are prone to lethargy, poor appetite, and bleeding gums and skin.

One pound of persimmons contains 0.56 milligrams of carotene (one-eighth of the daily requirement for carotene per person). Currently, fruits sold on the market, such as pears, contain only 0.04 milligrams of carotene per pound, and apples contain 0.32 milligrams per pound, while their economic value is clearly much higher than persimmons. One pound of persimmons contains 56 milligrams of Vitamin C. Eating half a pound of persimmons daily provides about 28 milligrams of Vitamin C, which is one-third of the daily requirement for a person. Pears contain 12 milligrams of Vitamin C per pound, and apples contain 20 milligrams per pound, both lower than the content in persimmons.

However, persimmons contain a relatively large amount of tannins, so it is not advisable to eat too many at once. Persimmons that have not undergone astringency removal have a very strong astringent taste, which is caused by tannins. The astringency removal process involves changes inside the persimmon, producing substances such as acetone, acetaldehyde, and ethanol, which render the tannins insoluble, so we don't taste the astringency. However, tannins can still be released in the intestines, having an astringent effect on the intestinal walls, reducing digestive capacity and causing constipation. (Liu Dongsheng)

### 柿子的营养价值

    柿子的营养价值
    柿子是一种既经济又好吃的水果。柿子含有一些矿物质——钙、磷、钾，也有甲种维生素和丙种维生素。
    在柿子里，甲种维生素是以胡萝卜素的状态存在着的。假如我们的身体缺少了甲种维生素，眼睛就容易发干，皮肤干燥变粗，身体抵抗力减弱，特别在冬天容易伤风感冒。如果膳食内缺乏丙种维生素，就容易精神不振，胃口不佳，牙龈和皮下容易出血等现象。
    一斤柿子所含的胡萝卜素为0．56毫克（为每人每日胡萝卜素需要量的八分之一）。目前市上所出售的水果，如梨每斤只含胡萝卜素0．04毫克，苹果每斤含0．32毫克，而经济价值显然比柿子贵得多。柿子每斤含丙种维生素56毫克，每天吃半斤柿子就可得到28毫克左右的丙种维生素，为一个人每天所需丙种维生素的三分之一。梨每斤含有丙种维生素12毫克，苹果每斤含有20毫克，都不如柿子含量高。
    但是柿子含有较多的单宁，所以一次不宜吃得太多。柿子没有经过脱涩处理，就有一种很强烈的涩味，这是由于单宁所引起的。脱涩作用就是使柿子内部发生变化，产生丙酮、乙醛、乙醇等物质，使单宁不能溶解，我们就吃不出涩味来。但是单宁在肠道中仍然可以释放出来，对肠壁有收敛作用，使消化能力减低，大便干燥。　　（刘冬生）
