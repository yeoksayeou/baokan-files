The revised draft of the National Agricultural Development Program (1956-1967) proposed by our Party Central Committee has been universally and warmly welcomed by the broad masses of people across the country, inspiring greater enthusiasm for production among the vast peasantry.

The National Agricultural Development Program is a great program for building our socialist countryside and ensuring the smooth realization of industrialization in our country. The realization of this program will guarantee the tremendous development of our agriculture, guarantee that the lives of our peasants will greatly exceed the level of well-to-do middle peasants; it will also promote and guarantee the smooth development of our industry, guarantee the further consolidation of our worker-peasant alliance, and the steady and universal improvement of the lives of the people across the country. We must immediately launch a broad discussion of these forty articles of the program in all rural areas, factories, institutions, schools, troops, and street communities throughout the country, so that the people of the whole country can recognize the direction, strengthen their confidence, and everyone can work hard to transform China.

Now is an important time for winter production and preparing for spring production next year. Discussing the forty articles of the program at this time allows us to gather opinions and practical experience from the masses from the bottom up, formulate plans at all levels of provinces, counties, districts, townships, and agricultural cooperatives, and combine them with winter production, water conservancy construction, and large-scale fertilizer accumulation movements, to launch a new nationwide production upsurge and strive for a bumper harvest in 1958. At the same time, the broad masses are currently engaged in a great debate on the two roads. It is also appropriate to conduct a discussion on the forty articles of the program at this time. Just set aside a period of time, about seven to ten evenings in rural areas, will be enough. Discuss a few articles each evening, solicit opinions; read each article one by one, discuss each article one by one. There can be different discussion methods among different groups of people. You can discuss the issues that the masses are most interested in more, and discuss the issues that they are not very interested in less; you should discuss important issues more, and discuss less important issues less. The process of discussion should become a process of tapping production potential and overcoming various conservative ideas, a process of formulating or revising production plans for societies, townships, districts, and counties, and should become a major mobilization for agricultural production this winter and next spring.

After the draft of the National Agricultural Development Program was published in 1956, it inspired the enthusiasm of the broad masses of peasants for production and created an upsurge in agricultural production across the country. Both in the North and the South, there were advanced examples of high-yield increases everywhere. In total, in 1956, 29 counties and cities across the country had reached or exceeded the production targets of 400, 500, and 800 jin stipulated in the draft agricultural program, which were the production targets stipulated in the program for 1967. Guangdong and Fujian provinces in the South had seven counties with yields of 1,000 jin. Dingxi County in Gansu, a poor area in the north, tripled its grain production in 1956 compared to 1953. This year, more counties and cities have reached or exceeded the production targets stipulated in the draft agricultural program for 1967. For example, in Hebei this year, 3,104 societies reached 400 jin, 198 societies reached more than 500 jin, 91 societies reached more than 600 jin, 68 societies reached more than 800 jin, and 11 societies reached more than 1,000 jin. Another example is Hongan County in Hubei, which has poor soil and poor production conditions. This year, the average grain yield per mu reached 834 jin, an increase of more than double compared to 1952. There are many similar examples in other provinces and regions. It is worth noting that some of these high-yield areas are very poor. If they can realize the targets of the draft agricultural development program ten years ahead of schedule, then can’t places with the same or better conditions do the same?

Some people are suffering from right-leaning conservatism, crawling as slowly as snails. They do not understand that after agricultural cooperation, we have the conditions and the necessity to make a great leap forward on the production front. This is in accordance with objective laws. The achievements of 1956 fully reflect the correctness of this leap-forward development. People with right-leaning conservative ideas do not understand this principle and do not understand the great creativity of the peasant masses after cooperation, so they think that the draft agricultural development program is "rash." They regard the correct leap forward as "rash." They do not understand that so-called "rashness" is blind action without actual conditions and therefore without the possibility of success. Our leap forward in 1956 was not like this at all. There were many conditions that could be realized, and therefore we achieved great results. Otherwise, it would be impossible to explain why, in 1956, our country suffered severe natural disasters, but grain production exceeded the bumper harvest of 1955 by more than 10 billion jin.

In order to enable the masses to clearly distinguish various ideological and cognitive issues in the discussion and to play an active role in actual work, we hope that when discussing the forty articles of the program, all localities will grasp the central issues, which are: Can and how can the targets set in the agricultural development program be achieved within twelve years? Can and how can the income of the original well-to-do middle peasants be caught up with and exceeded within a few years? How should we strive for a bumper agricultural harvest next year? The discussion should also come up with specific solutions to these problems and start implementing them immediately. When Risheng Agricultural Cooperative in Chongren County, Jiangxi Province, recently discussed the revised draft of the agricultural development program, it grasped these central issues, and the results of the discussion were very good. Everyone cited many facts to prove that the potential for agricultural production is still great and that past ideas were too conservative. As a result, they immediately perked up and formulated a production plan for the next five years, striving to achieve a grain yield of 1,000 jin per mu by 1962, which is five years ahead of the targets of the revised draft of the agricultural development program. When Gaojiatai Agricultural Cooperative in Lin County, Henan Province, discussed this draft, it summarized the achievements of water conservancy construction in recent years. The members unanimously agreed that the achievements in water conservancy construction in the past were great and that there was still much to be done in the future. While discussing, they formulated a plan and immediately assigned the task of water conservancy construction to various production teams and production groups. Now everyone is very motivated, and an unprecedented upsurge in water conservancy construction and preparation for next year's major production has been launched. If last year the grain output of 29 counties and cities across the country exceeded the targets stipulated in the draft agricultural program, then this year at least dozens of counties and cities will reach or exceed this target. As long as all localities grasp the production links this winter and next spring, step up winter plowing and winter planting, vigorously develop water conservancy and fertilizer accumulation movements, and lay the foundation for agricultural production increase next year, we believe that more regions will be able to realize the targets stipulated in the agricultural program ahead of schedule next year.

Party committees at all levels should seize the current opportunity, mobilize the broad masses to seriously discuss the revised draft of the agricultural program, invigorate their spirits, and muster their strength. They must not only oppose passivity and drift, but also oppose unrealistic empty talk. We must fight against right-leaning negative emotions and the phenomenon of empty talk. We want to praise the vigorous revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses. Now, in many regions, the peasant masses have put forward the slogan "Cross the Yellow River! Cross the Yangtze River!" at the meetings of the whole township and the whole society. What they mean is that north of the Yellow River, we must strive to increase the average grain yield per mu to 500 jin, and north of the Yangtze River, we must strive to increase the average grain yield per mu to 800 jin. These slogans are good, and a few units have already achieved such goals. The people of our new China should have such aspirations! We must strive to align ourselves with advanced standards at all times, and we must humbly and enthusiastically absorb the experiences of advanced regions, especially the experiences of regions with the same or similar local conditions. In each county, there will also be relatively advanced regions, or at least you can find relatively advanced townships, societies, and production teams. We must treat all the good experiences they have created with the greatest enthusiasm and make them a force to inspire and guide all the people to move forward.

Developing agriculture is not just a matter for the rural masses and rural cadres. Everyone's life is inseparable from agriculture, and everyone should fulfill their responsibility for the development of agriculture. In the great debate on the forty articles of the program, members of various factories, institutions, schools, troops, and street residents, democratic parties, intellectuals, and industrialists and businessmen should clearly recognize the close relationship between the development of agriculture and themselves, propose some things that they can and should do for the development of agriculture, and start implementing them as soon as possible. Leading organs at all levels must take action first, and send a large number of cadres who can be transferred to the countryside as soon as possible to strengthen the leadership and strength on the agricultural front. Liaoning Province has decided and started to send more than 200,000 cadres to the countryside, Jiangsu Province has decided and started to send 130,000 cadres to the countryside, and other provinces and cities are also sending cadres to the countryside one after another. The method they adopted is called "going to the bottom," working directly at the grassroots level, and directly participating in production. This is a very good and very important measure. Staff members who can go to the countryside and the mountains to directly support agricultural production should go to the countryside and the mountains as soon as possible. Young intellectuals should regard going to the countryside and the mountains as the best way to train themselves, correct their wrong understanding of agricultural production in this great debate, and be determined to go to the peasant masses wholeheartedly for a long time. Senior intellectuals, especially scientific and technological workers related to agriculture, should also further understand the actual situation and urgent needs of Chinese agriculture in this great debate, and contribute their knowledge to the great cause of socialist construction planned by the forty articles of the program faster and better.

Let us launch a nationwide debate, mobilize the strength of the whole country, and act with one heart and one mind to launch a huge upsurge in agricultural production and construction!

### 发动全民，讨论四十条纲要，掀起农业生产的新高潮

    发动全民，讨论四十条纲要，掀起农业生产的新高潮
    我们党中央提出的一九五六年到一九六七年的全国农业发展纲要的修正草案，受到了全国各地广大人民群众的普遍热烈的欢迎，鼓舞起广大农民更大的生产热情。
    全国农业发展纲要是建设我国社会主义农村和保证我国顺利实现工业化的伟大纲领。实现这个纲领，就将保证我国农业的巨大发展，保证我国农民生活大大超过富裕中农的水平；也将促进和保证我国工业的顺利发展，保证我国工农联盟的进一步巩固和全国人民生活的稳步的和普遍的改善。我们要立即在全国所有的农村、工厂、机关、学校、部队和街道居民中，广泛地展开一次关于这四十条纲要的大讨论，使全国人民认清方向，坚定信心，人人努力，改造中国。
    现在正是冬季生产和准备明春生产的重要时机，在这个时候讨论四十条纲要，正好可以从下而上地集中群众的意见和实际经验，制订省、县、区、乡和农业合作社的各级计划，结合冬季生产、兴修水利、大量积肥等项运动，掀起一个全国规模的新的生产高潮，争取1958年的丰收。同时，广大群众目前正进行着两条道路的大辩论，在这个时候进行关于四十条纲要的讨论也是适宜的。只要划出一段时间，在农村大约七个晚上到十个晚上就够了。每一个晚上讨论几条，征求意见；逐条宣读，逐条讨论。在不同的群众中可以有不同的讨论方法，群众最有兴趣的问题可以多讨论，兴趣不大的问题可以少讨论；重要的问题要多讨论，不大重要的问题可以少讨论。讨论的过程应该成为挖掘生产潜力、克服各种保守思想的过程，应该成为制订或修改社、乡、区、县的生产规划的过程，应该成为今冬明春的农业生产大动员的过程。
    1956年公布了全国农业发展纲要草案以后，曾经鼓舞起广大农民的生产热情，造成了全国农业生产的高潮。不论北方和南方，到处都有高额增产的先进事例。总计1956年全国有二十九个县、市已经达到或超过了农业纲要草案所规定的四百斤、五百斤、八百斤的生产指标，即纲要中规定的1967年的生产指标。南方的广东和福建两省就有七个千斤县。北方贫瘠地区的甘肃定西县在1956年增产的粮食达到了1953年的三倍。今年有更多的县、市达到或超过了农业纲要草案所规定的1967年的生产指标。如河北今年有三千一百零四个社达到了四百斤，有一百九十八个社达到了五百斤以上，有九十一个社达到了六百斤以上，有六十八个社达到了八百斤以上，有十一个社达到了千斤以上。又如湖北红安县土质瘠薄，生产条件不好，今年每亩平均产粮也达到八百三十四斤，比1952年增长了一倍以上。别的省区还有很多类似的例子。值得注意的是这些大量增产的地区，有的是十分贫瘠的，在那里能够提早十年实现了农业发展纲要草案的指标，那末，条件与它们相同或者比它们好的地方，难道反而不能做到吗？
    有些人害了右倾保守的毛病，像蜗牛一样爬行得很慢，他们不了解在农业合作化以后，我们就有条件也有必要在生产战线上来一个大的跃进。这是符合于客观规律的。1956年的成绩充分反映了这种跃进式发展的正确性。有右倾保守思想的人，因为不懂得这个道理，不了解合作化以后农民群众的伟大的创造性，所以他们认为农业发展纲要草案是“冒进了”。他们把正确的跃进看成了“冒进”。他们不了解所谓“冒进”是没有实际条件，因而是没有成功可能的盲目行动。而我们在1956年的跃进却完全不是这样，是有很多可以实现的条件，因而取得了巨大的成绩。否则，就无法说明，为什么1956年我国遭受了严重的自然灾害，而粮食产量却超过了大丰收的1955年一百多亿斤。
    为了在讨论中使群众能够对于各种思想认识问题辨别清楚，并且能够在实际工作中发生积极的作用，我们希望各地在讨论四十条纲要的时候，抓住中心的问题，这就是：能不能和如何在十二年内达到农业发展纲要提出的指标？能不能和如何在几年内赶上和超过原来富裕中农的收入？应该怎样争取明年农业的大丰收？在讨论中还应该想出具体地解决这些问题的办法，马上开始实行。江西崇仁县日升农业合作社最近在讨论农业发展纲要的修正草案的时候，抓住了这些中心问题，讨论的结果很好。大家举出许多事实，证明农业生产的潜力还很大：过去的想法太保守。于是他们马上提起了劲头，制订了今后五年的生产规划，争取到1962年粮食亩产量要达到一千斤，即提前五年超过农业发展纲要修正草案的指标。河南林县高家台农业合作社讨论这个草案的时候，总结了几年来兴修水利的成绩。社员们一致认为过去兴修水利成绩很大，今后还是大有可为。他们一面讨论，一面制订规划，立即把兴修水利的任务分配给各个生产队和生产小组。现在大家干劲很足，一个规模空前的兴修水利和准备明年大生产的高潮已经发动起来了。如果说去年全国已经有二十九个县、市的粮食产量，超过了农业纲要草案所规定的指标；那末，今年至少总有几十个县、市会达到或超过这个指标。只要各地抓紧今冬明春的生产环节，加紧冬耕冬种，大力开展水利和积肥运动，为明年的农业增产打下基础，我们相信明年就会有更多的地区能够提前实现农业纲要所规定的指标。
    各级党委应该抓紧目前的时机，发动广大群众认真讨论农业纲要的修正草案，振作精神，鼓起一把劲，既要反对消极自流，也要反对不切实际的空喊。我们必须向右倾消极情绪和说空话的现象作斗争。我们要赞扬群众中生气勃勃的革命热情。现在有许多地区的农民群众，在全乡、全社的会议上提出了“跨过黄河！跨过长江！”的口号。他们的意思是说，黄河以北也要争取把平均每亩粮食产量提高到五百斤，长江以北也要争取把平均每亩粮食产量提高到八百斤。这些口号是好的，并且有少数单位已经达到了这样的目标。我们新中国的人民应该有这样的志气！我们时时刻刻都要努力向先进的标准看齐，要虚心地热情地吸取先进地区的经验，特别是与本地条件相同或相似的地区的经验。在每个县里，也会有比较先进的地区，至少也可以找到比较先进的乡、社和生产队。要用最大的热情对待他们所创造的一切好经验，使它成为鼓舞和引导全体人民前进的力量。
    发展农业，并不只是农村群众和农村干部的事情。人人的生活都离不开农业，人人对农业的发展都要尽自己的一份责任。在关于四十条纲要的大辩论中间，各个工厂、机关、学校、部队的成员和街道居民，民主党派人士、知识分子和工商业者，都应该明确地认识发展农业同自己的密切关系，提出自己对发展农业能做和应做的一些事情，并且尽快地开始实行。各级领导机关首先要行动起来，要尽快地把可能抽调的大批干部下放到农村去，加强农业战线上的领导和力量。辽宁省已经决定并且着手下放的干部有二十多万人，江苏省已经决定并且着手下放的干部有十三万人，其他各省、市也都在陆续下放。他们采取的办法叫做“一放到底”，直接到基层去工作，直接参加生产。这是很好和很重要的措施。能够下乡、上山去直接支援农业生产的工作人员，都要尽快下乡去，上山去。青年知识分子更要把下乡、上山当作锻炼自己的最好的方式，要在这次大辩论中把自己对待农业生产的错误认识改正过来，下决心长期地全心全意地到农民群众中去。高级知识分子，特别是同农业有关的科学技术工作者，在这次大辩论中，同样应该进一步了解中国农业的实际情况和迫切需要，更快更好地把自己的知识贡献给四十条纲要所规划的伟大社会主义建设的事业。
    让我们展开全民的大讨论，动员全国的力量，万众一心地行动起来，掀起一个规模巨大的农业生产建设的高潮吧！
