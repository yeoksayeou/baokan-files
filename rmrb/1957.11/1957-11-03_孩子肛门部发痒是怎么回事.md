What Causes Itching Around a Child's Anus?

Some children often complain of itching around their anus at night when they sleep. This is a symptom of pinworm disease. Pinworms are small worms that look like tiny white threads. They like to live in people's intestines, especially near the cecum. When the female worm lays eggs, it crawls along the large intestine to the anus to lay eggs (especially at night when the temperature is suitable). The stimulation of the worm body causes the patient to feel unbearable itching around the anus.

Pinworm disease rarely threatens a child's life. If left untreated, it can cause inflammation of the intestinal mucosa, leading to nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, loss of appetite, and frequent urination, causing the child to become thin and anemic.

If a child has pinworms, treatment is essential. There are many medications for treating pinworms, which will not be introduced here. Normally, if pinworms are found in a child, you can give the child some carrot juice every day. Carrots not only contain vitamins A, B, and C, but also have the effect of expelling pinworms. The method of making carrot juice is to first wash the carrots, peel them, blanch them in boiling water for 3-5 seconds, and then press them into juice. Carrot juice can be drunk twice a day, each time a quarter to half a teacup, continuously for two or three weeks.

Treating pinworms is not a simple task, and the disease is prone to recurrence. The recurrence is often due to poor hygiene during treatment, leading to re-infection with pinworm eggs. To accelerate treatment and avoid recurrence, the following points must be observed during treatment:

First, pay attention to the hygiene of the child's hands and the area around the anus: The eggs laid by pinworms mature quickly, maturing in about six or seven hours and becoming infectious. The skin around the anus often carries mature eggs, and scratching easily contaminates the hands with eggs. These then enter the mouth through food and drink, leading to re-infection. Therefore, children should be taught not to scratch their anus with their hands and not to put their fingers in their mouths. Children's hands should be washed frequently, especially before meals and after bowel movements. Washing the anus with warm water before bedtime and after bowel movements can wash away the eggs attached to the skin, preventing them from contaminating clothes and bedding, which increases the chance of infection.

Second, family members with pinworms must be treated together to avoid mutual infection and reduce recurrence.

Third, pay attention to food hygiene and environmental hygiene. Children have many opportunities to be infected with pinworms. Fruits, vegetables, and street snacks exposed to dust often contain pinworm eggs. Therefore, pay attention to cleanliness when eating fruits and vegetables, and it is best not to buy snacks for children casually. In addition, children should be prohibited from defecating anywhere to avoid polluting the soil and spreading the disease. (Sanchuan)

    孩子肛门部发痒是怎么回事
    有的儿童每到夜间睡觉时，常吵嚷肛门部发痒，这是患蛲虫病的症状。蛲虫是一种像细小的白线头一样的小虫，它最喜欢寄居在人的肠子里，特别是在盲肠附近的地方。当雌虫产卵时，就沿着大肠爬到肛门附近去产卵（特别是在晚上温度适宜时）。由于虫体的刺激，患者就会觉得肛门部奇痒难忍。
    蛲虫病对孩子很少有生命的威胁。如果不注意治疗，它可以使肠粘膜发炎，引起恶心、呕吐、腹痛、食欲不振及小便次数多，从而使孩子陷于消瘦和贫血。
    儿童有蛲虫，一定要注意治疗。治疗蛲虫的药物很多，不在这里介绍。平常，如果发现孩子有蛲虫，可以每天给儿童喝些胡萝卜汁。胡萝卜中不但含有甲乙丙三种维生素，而且还有驱除蛲虫的效果。胡萝卜汁的制法是，先把胡萝卜洗干净，削去皮，在开水内烫3—5秒钟，然后压榨成汁。胡萝卜汁可以每天喝两次，每次喝一茶杯的四分之一至二分之一，连续喝两三个星期。
    治疗蛲虫不是一件简易的事，这种病很容易复发。复发的原因常常是因为在治疗期间不注意卫生，重新感染蛲虫卵。为了加速治疗，避免复发，在治疗期间必须注意以下几件事：
    第一、要注意儿童的手和肛门周围的卫生：蛲虫下的卵成熟较快，约经六、七小时就可成熟，具有传染能力。肛围皮肤上是常带有成熟卵的，经过搔痒很容易把虫卵沾染在手上，通过饮食又进入口腔，以致重新感染。因此，要教育儿童不要用手去抓肛门，不要把手指放进嘴里；儿童的手要常洗，特别是饭前、便后更要注意洗；在儿童睡前，便后用温水洗肛围，可以把附在皮肤上的虫卵洗掉，以免沾染在衣服、被褥上增加感染机会。
    第二，家中有蛲虫的人，必须同时一起治疗，才能避免互相传染，减少复发。
    第三，要注意饮食卫生和环境卫生。儿童感染蛲虫的机会是多方面的，瓜果、蔬菜和暴露在灰尘中的街头零食，常混有蛲虫卵。因此，吃瓜果、蔬菜时要注意清洁，最好不给儿童随便买零食吃。此外，应禁止儿童随地大便，以免污染土壤扩大传播。（三川）
