Xinhua News Agency, 19th. The Ministry of Culture promptly exposed and criticized the right-leaning ideologies of insufficient rectification among some leaders in the ministry and its affiliated units, and further deployed rectification work. Chen Kehan, Deputy Minister of Culture, pointed out in a report to the Ministry of Culture's cadre meeting on the 18th, addressing this issue, that leaders at all levels should not only see the current vigorous great blooming and contending, but must promptly overcome the shortcomings of not rectifying thoroughly in order to lead the rectification movement to a new victory.

Chen Kehan, in assessing the rectification situation of the Ministry of Culture and its affiliated units over the past month, said that the development of the movement is normal and healthy, the masses have been basically mobilized, and most leaders have the determination to rectify. However, generally speaking, the blooming and contending are not deep and thorough enough, some of the masses still have many concerns, especially on issues such as Party-masses relations and leadership style, they have not spoken their minds freely; currently, rectification lags behind blooming and contending, rectifying both slowly, little, and small, and correcting shortcomings is not well integrated with rectifying leadership thought. There are many objective factors contributing to the above situation, but the key issue is that the leaders lack determination, are afraid of pain and being tickled, and are not rectifying thoroughly.

Chen Kehan then criticized some leaders' right-leaning ideologies, such as not trusting the masses, not daring to invite trouble, and being passive and hesitant in rectification. He also solemnly pointed out: the bad work style of individual leaders ignoring mass criticism and even using roundabout methods to obstruct it is absolutely unacceptable. For example, someone in the film printing factory even threatened the masses who criticized him, saying, "You are not much different from rightists." These situations have aroused the indignation of the masses. Currently, the leadership has handed over his mistakes to the unit's employees for extensive discussion, and will then take further action.

In his report, Chen Kehan also refuted some leaders' statement that "it cannot be said that most of the opinions of the masses in this unit are correct." He hoped that leaders would trust the masses, take the lead in rectification, and further lead and promote great blooming and contending. He also demanded that leaders of the Ministry of Culture and its affiliated units examine their shortcomings and errors in leadership style and leadership methods in front of the masses, and that Party organizations should play a supervisory role and resolutely fight against negative emotions and the suppression of democracy. He pointed out that the climax of blooming and contending has passed, and units that have not rectified enough in terms of leadership style should immediately make up for it.

By November 15, all of the Ministry of Culture and its more than 50 affiliated enterprises and institutions had entered the third stage, which is mainly focused on rectification. Most units have launched a high tide of great blooming and contending, and some units have entered the stage of thematic blooming and contending. Over the past month, the masses posted more than 16,000 big-character posters and held more than 580 forums, putting forward about 40,000 criticisms and suggestions. The Party Group and Party Committee of the Ministry of Culture have preliminarily examined their work, identified seven major issues that should be addressed, and formed special groups to formulate improvement plans for widespread discussion by the masses. The central link of the ministry's current rectification work is to improve the system, streamline institutions, and delegate cadres. A mass debate on this issue will soon be launched in the Ministry of Culture and its affiliated units.

### 及时批判某些领导人整改不力的右倾思想  文化部进一步部署整改工作

    及时批判某些领导人整改不力的右倾思想
    文化部进一步部署整改工作
    新华社19日讯　文化部及时揭露和批判本部和所属单位中某些领导人整改不力的右倾思想，进一步部署整改工作。文化部副部长陈克寒18日针对这个问题在文化部干部会议上作报告时指出，各级领导人不要只看到目前轰轰烈烈的大鸣大放，必须及时克服改的不狠的缺点，才能把整风运动引向新的胜利。
    陈克寒在估计文化部及所属单位一个月来的整改情况时说，运动的发展是正常和健康的，群众已基本上发动起来，大部分领导人有整改的决心。但是一般地说，鸣放还不够深透，部分群众还有不少顾虑，特别是在党群关系和领导作风等问题上没有畅所欲言；目前整改还落后于鸣放，改得既慢而少又小，改正缺点同整顿领导思想也没有很好结合。产生上述情况，有许多客观因素，但领导人决心不够，怕痛怕痒，改的不狠则是一个关键性问题。
    陈克寒接着批判了部分领导人不相信群众，不敢引火烧身，以及在整改上消极迟疑等右倾思想，他还严肃地指出：个别领导人对群众批评置之不理甚至用迂回曲折办法加以阻挡的恶劣作风，是绝对不能容许的。例如，影片洗印厂有人竟威胁对他提出批评的群众说：“你同右派分子没有多大差别”，这些情况已经引起群众的愤慨。目前领导上已将他的错误，交由本单位职工广泛讨论，将来再作进一步处理。
    陈克寒在报告中还批驳了某些领导人的所谓“不能说本单位群众的意见大部分是正确的”的说法。他希望领导人相信群众，带头整改，进一步领导和推动大鸣大放。他还要求文化部及所属单位的领导人在群众面前检查自己的领导作风和领导方法上的缺点和错误，党的组织应发挥监督作用，同消极情绪和压制民主现象进行坚决的斗争。他指出，鸣放高潮已经过去，而在领导作风方面整改不够的单位也应立即补课。
    文化部及所属五十多个事业、企业单位到11月15日止已经全部转入以整改为主的第三阶段，绝大部分单位已掀起大鸣大放高潮，部分单位已转入专题鸣放阶段。一个月来群众共贴出了一万六千多张大字报，举行了五百八十多次座谈会，共提出了约四万条批评和建议。中共文化部党组、党委已经初步检查了工作，确定了应当着手解决的七个重大问题，并分别组成专门小组拟制改进方案，以便交群众广泛讨论。这个部目前整改工作的中心环节是改进体制，紧缩机构和下放干部，关于这个问题的群众性大辩论即将在文化部及所属单位中展开。
