Accumulate Urine to Irrigate Wheat
Ye Chaolin

This year, during the winter wheat sowing season, major wheat-producing provinces such as Henan, Shandong, Hebei, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Anhui, Jiangsu, Hubei, and Gansu have suffered droughts rarely seen in the last one or two decades.

Because everyone is wholeheartedly engaged in combating drought and sowing, they have no time to accumulate fertilizer and deliver manure. Therefore, many wheat fields in various regions are generally under-fertilized. A good way to reduce the impact of insufficient base fertilizer is to apply fast-acting fertilizer as early as possible. Generally, for wheat fields with sufficient base fertilizer and good sowing quality, timely topdressing and watering can further increase wheat yield.

For wheat fields, human urine is the best kind of fast-acting topdressing. According to scientific analysis, every thousand catties of human urine contains about five catties of nitrogen, which is equivalent to about twenty-five catties of ammonium sulfate in terms of fertilizer effect. The results of a three-year experiment in Henan Province from 1952 to 1954 showed that irrigating each mu with 500 to 1,000 catties of urine could increase production by 24% to 45%, which means each hundred catties of urine could increase wheat production by more than four catties. Shandong Province and the North China Agricultural Science Institute have also conducted many experiments, and the results have proved that irrigating wheat fields with urine can significantly increase production.

In recent years, although many regions have adopted the method of accumulating urine to irrigate wheat, the promotion work has generally not been done well. Last winter and this spring, only 3.1% of the wheat fields in Hebei Province were topdressed with urine. Other wheat-producing areas also have this phenomenon, discarding the human urine that is very effective as fertilizer.

Some people think that human urine is limited and its effect is not great. Actually, that's not the case. According to a survey by the North China Agricultural Science Institute, an agricultural cooperative with 250 to 300 households can collect about 2,000 catties of human urine every day in winter, and accumulate 300,000 catties of urine during the winter and spring urine irrigation season (November to March). This amount of urine can irrigate 300 mu of land. How can it be said that its quantity is limited and its use is not great?

Some farmers in some areas believe that urine contains salt and are afraid of damaging wheat seedlings after irrigation. Scientific experiments have proved that this concern is unnecessary. Human urine contains about 1% salt, and every thousand catties of urine contains only about ten catties of salt. These salts are distributed in one mu of land and will not harm the crops.

Currently, it is the appropriate season for accumulating urine to irrigate wheat. This is because there is more urine in the cold winter, so there is no need to rot it or dilute it with water, and it can be irrigated as it accumulates. The irrigation method is also simple and easy to implement.

After the realization of agricultural cooperativization, the peasants' enthusiasm for increasing production has been enhanced, and conditions are in place for carrying out the accumulation of urine to irrigate wheat. In the past, the Xiaoxinji Agricultural Cooperative in Hengshui County, Hebei Province, did not have the habit of accumulating urine. Because the members saw the benefits of accumulating urine to irrigate wheat through comparative experiments, they prepared furniture for storing urine, the cooperative built urine pools, manufactured urine-pulling carts, and formulated reasonable rewards for accumulating urine. All 251 households in the cooperative accumulate enough urine every day to irrigate more than two mu of wheat land. This shows that as long as the masses are well mobilized, the work of accumulating urine to irrigate wheat can be rapidly developed. (Attached picture)

    积尿浇麦
    叶超麟
    今年冬麦播种季节，河南、山东、河北、陕西、山西、安徽、江苏、湖北、甘肃等主要麦产省遭到了一、二十年来少有的干旱。
    由于大家全力以赴地抗旱播种，无暇积肥送粪，因此许多地区的麦田，普遍施肥不足。减低基肥不足的影响的好办法，是及早追施速效性肥料。一般基肥较足，播种质量较好的麦田，及时追肥、浇水，也可以进一步提高小麦产量。
    对麦田说，人尿是一种最好的速效性追肥。根据科学分析，每一千斤人尿含氮五斤左右，约相当于二十五斤硫酸铵的肥效。河南省1952—1954年三年试验结果，每亩浇尿五百到一千斤，就能增产24％到45％，也就是每百斤尿增产小麦四斤多。山东省部分地区和华北农业科学研究所也都作过多次试验，结果证明麦田浇尿可以增产不少。
    近年来，虽然已有不少地区采用了积尿浇麦的办法，但是推广工作一般作得不好。河北省去冬今春用尿追肥的麦田只占全省麦田面积的3．1％。其他麦产区也有这样的现象，把肥效很好的人尿都废弃了。
    有人认为人尿有限，它的作用不大。其实不是这样。据华北农业科学研究所调查，一个二百五十户到三百户的农业社，在冬季每天约可收集人尿二千斤，在冬春浇尿季节（11月—3月）可积尿三十万斤。这样多的尿能浇三百亩地。怎么能说它的数量有限，用处不大呢？
    有些地区农民认为尿里含有盐分，浇后怕浇坏麦苗。科学试验证明，这种顾虑是不必要的。人尿中含盐1％左右，每一千斤尿只含有盐十斤左右。这些盐分布在一亩地里是不会使庄稼受害的。
    目前，正是积尿浇麦的适宜季节。这是因为冬季天寒尿多，无需腐熟，也无需兑水，可以随积随浇。浇的方法也是简而易行的。
    农业合作化实现以后，农民增产的积极性提高了，开展积尿浇麦已有了条件。河北省衡水县小辛集农业社以往没有积尿习惯，由于通过对比试验，社员们看到了积尿浇麦的好处，准备了盛尿的家俱，社里修建了尿池，制造了拉尿的车和制定了合理的积尿报酬。全社二百五十一户，每天所积的尿，就可以浇两亩多麦地。由此可见，只要很好地发动群众，积尿浇麦的工作就能得到迅速开展。（附图片）
