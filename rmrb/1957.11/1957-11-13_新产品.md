    Glider
      In the factory-filled Tiexi District of Shenyang, there is a factory without chimneys or the sound of machines. This is China's first factory specializing in the manufacture of gliders - the Shenyang Glider Factory.
    The wooden fuselage of a high-grade glider requires more than two thousand parts of various sizes to be glued together, with the larger parts weighing dozens of kilograms and the smaller ones as little as a few grams. The production requirements are very strict.
    The picture above shows the first "Muha-style" high-grade glider successfully trial-produced by this factory.
    Soon, glider athletes from all over the country will be able to fly the high-grade gliders produced by this factory. (Wang Jimin)
    1500x Microscope
    A binocular biological microscope capable of magnifying 1500 times has recently been successfully trial-produced at the state-owned Yunnan Optical Instrument Factory and will soon be exhibited at the Leipzig Fair in East Germany.
    The precision requirements of this microscope are very high, and all parts are manufactured by the factory itself. It is expected that it will soon be in formal production. (Xinhua News Agency)
    Dust-Proof Respirator
    Yang Yang, a young technician at the State-owned Xikuangshan Mining Bureau, successfully created an isolation-type dust-proof respirator.
    This dust-proof respirator allows workers in the mine to breathe fresh air, avoid dust hazards, and is an effective tool to prevent the most common occupational disease in mines - silicosis.
    The isolation-type dust-proof respirator uses fresh air from outside the mine, compressed by an air compressor, which is then decompressed, filtered, and purified before being sent through a hose to a specially made mask for people to breathe.

    Weaving Woolen Fabric with Lignin Fiber
    The Qingdao Social Welfare Artificial Fiber Production Group, based on Soviet technical data, has successfully trial-produced lignin wool.
    Lignin wool is woven from yarn that is made from lignin fiber extracted from tree bark and mixed with 20% cotton. It can be dyed in various colors for making sofa fabrics, curtains, coats, etc.

    滑翔机
      在工厂林立的沈阳铁西区，有一座没有烟囱、也没有机器响声的工厂。这就是我国第一座专门制造滑翔机的工厂——沈阳滑翔机制造厂。
    一架高级滑翔机的木机身，要用两千多个大小零件粘起来，大的零件重到几十公斤，小的轻到只有几克。制作时要求是十分严格的。
    上图便是这个厂试制成功的第一架“木哈式”高级滑翔机。
    不久，全国各地的滑翔运动员，就可以驾上这个厂出产的高级滑翔机了。　　　　（王继民）
    一千五百倍的显微镜
    能够放大一千五百倍的双筒生物显微镜，最近在国营云南光学仪器厂试制成功，不久将在民主德国来比锡博览会上展出。
    这种显微镜的精度要求很高，全部零件都是自己制造的。预计不久就可以正式生产。　（新华社）
    防尘呼吸器
    国营锡矿山矿务局青年技术员杨洋创造隔绝式防尘呼吸器成功。
    这种防尘呼吸器，可以使在矿井下工作的职工呼吸到新鲜空气，避免粉尘危害，是防止矿山中最容易发生的职业病——矽肺病的有效工具。
    隔绝式防尘呼吸器利用压缩空气机压缩的矿井外新鲜空气，经过减压过滤净化以后，通过一条皮管子输送到特制的口罩内，供人呼吸。

    用木素纤维织呢子
    青岛市社会福利人造纤维生产组，根据苏联的技术资料，试制木素呢成功。
    木素呢是用从树皮里提炼出来的木素纤维再掺20％的棉花混纺的线织成的。它可以染成各种颜色来做沙发布、窗帘、大衣等。
