Xinhua News Agency, 10th. The All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives issued instructions on the 4th, requiring supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions to strengthen the supply of production materials this winter to support the high tide of agricultural production this winter and next spring.
	The instructions require all regions to vigorously supply the equipment, tools, and water lifting machinery needed for farmland water conservancy construction and manure accumulation. The instructions state that a large amount of steel materials, cement, wood, moso bamboo, and palm fiber are needed for farmland water conservancy construction. Supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions must, under the unified leadership of the local Party and government, coordinate with relevant departments to carefully calculate and rationally allocate these materials. This winter, a certain number of waterwheels and water lifting machinery must be supplied to winter wheat areas to meet the needs of winter irrigation and spring watering of wheat. The demand for these materials is very large, and many are in short supply. Therefore, all regions must actively seek sources of goods and study substitutes. Under normal circumstances, the supply of power machinery should adopt the principle of appropriate centralized supply when the conditions for use are met. The focus of the supply should be on drought prevention, flood drainage, and cash crop and high-yield crop areas, and the needs of agricultural production for drought resistance and flood drainage should be met first.
	In terms of fertilizer, in addition to actively supplying manure accumulation tools and green manure seeds to help the masses accumulate manure, supply and marketing cooperatives should also organize sufficient sources of miscellaneous fertilizer and strengthen leadership, stipulate targets, and prevent spontaneous flow. For chemical fertilizers, according to the indicators distributed by the central government, under the principle of giving priority to cotton and other major cash crop and high-yield crop areas, the allocation and transportation work should be done level by level, and the application experience of phosphate fertilizer should be summarized and promoted.
	The instructions state that in order to do a better job of supply work next year, supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions must make preparations during the winter slack season. First of all, they must go deep into all agricultural cooperatives to investigate the use of production materials this year and the needs for production materials next year, and help agricultural cooperatives rationally arrange production investment plans. Then, based on the information obtained, they should study the regional applicability of various production materials. For the production materials needed by agricultural cooperatives next year, if the source of goods is guaranteed, pre-sales should be carried out according to the allocation plan. If the source of goods is insufficient or unavailable, the source of goods should be actively organized.
	Since warehouses of supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels still store a lot of double-wheel (single) plows, pesticides, pesticide machinery, and waterwheels and other production materials, the instructions require supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions to properly keep them and quickly check the varieties, quantities, quality, specifications, models, and storage conditions of the stored production materials, and handle them separately. If the quantity is insufficient, replenish it according to the plan; if it should be processed and modified, it should be processed and modified quickly; if it should be repaired or supplemented with parts, it should be repaired and supplemented with parts quickly; if the specifications and quality are poor, it should be inspected, modified, and remade by the original manufacturer in cooperation with relevant departments in accordance with the principle of "factory responsible system"; if it is surplus or unsuitable here, it should be transferred to areas that need and are suitable for use; if it has expired or is damaged to the point of being unusable, it should be scrapped according to the prescribed procedures; if it is not properly kept, storage work should be improved.
	The instructions state that protecting draught animals is also a very important task. Especially in disaster areas, draught animals have shown signs of being thin. Supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels should give full play to their past experience in protecting draught animals and strive to reduce the unnecessary deaths and weakness of draught animals. Supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions should investigate and understand the supply and demand of draught animals this winter, arrange adjustment plans, summarize past experience in adjusting draught animals, and actively do a good job in adjusting draught animals. In order to meet the needs of agricultural production and stimulate the breeding of draught animals, Qinghai, Heilongjiang, Jilin, Guizhou and other provinces and Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Regions, which are draught animal producing areas and have many livestock, are required to vigorously support the draught animals needed by agricultural areas, and put forward foreign transfer plans earlier.
	The instructions also require supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions to assist industrial, handicraft, agricultural, and water conservancy departments in doing a good job in the repair and replacement of water conservancy tools, new agricultural tools, and pesticide machinery in advance during the winter. If parts are lost, replenish them immediately. Agricultural cooperatives should designate special personnel to do a good job in the custody and maintenance of agricultural machinery and tools that have been repaired.

    全国供销总社发出指示
    大力供应生产资料
    支援农业生产高潮
    新华社10日讯　中华全国供销合作总社在4日发出指示，要求各地供销合作社在今年冬季加强生产资料的供应工作，支援今冬明春的农业生产高潮。
    指示要求各地大力供应兴修农田水利、积肥所需的器材、工具和提水机械。指示说，兴修农田水利所需要的大量的钢铁器材、水泥、木材、毛竹和棕片等物资，各地供销社必须在当地党政统一领导下，协同有关部门，精打细算，合理分配。今年冬季必须供应冬麦地区一定数量的水车和提水机械，以满足小麦冬灌春浇的需要。上述这些物资需要量很大，其中又多是供不应求的东西，因此各地还必须积极寻找货源，研究代用品。在一般情况下，对动力机械的供应，应该在具备使用条件的情况下，采取适当集中供应的原则。供应的重点是防旱、排涝和经济作物、高产作物地区，并首先满足农业生产抗旱排涝的需要。
    在肥料方面，供销社除积极供应积肥工具、绿肥种籽，帮助群众积肥外，还应该以足够的力量组织杂肥货源，并且要加强领导，规定指标，防止自流。对化学肥料应根据中央分配的指标，在优先供应棉花及其他主要经济作物和高产作物地区的方针下，逐级做好分配与调运工作，并普遍总结磷肥的施用经验，加以推广。
    指示说，为了把明年的供应工作做得更好，各地供销社必须利用冬闲季节，做好准备。首先要深入所有农业社调查今年生产资料的使用和明年生产资料的需要情况，帮助农业社合理安排生产投资的规划，然后根据了解到的情况，研究各种生产资料的地区适用性。农业社明年需要的生产资料，凡货源已有保证的，即按分配计划进行预售，货源不足或无着落的，应积极组织货源。
    由于各级供销社仓库里还储存着很多双轮（单）铧犁、农药、农药械和水车等生产资料，指示要求各地供销社妥善保管，并迅速查清库存生产资料的品种、数量、质量、规格型号和保管情况，分别加以处理。数量不足的按计划补足起来；应该加工改制的就迅速加工改制；应该修理或补充零件的就迅速修理和补充零件；规格质量低劣的，应本着“出厂负责制”的原则，协同有关部门由原制造厂检修改制；这里多余或不适用的，调剂到需要和适合使用的地区；已经失效或损坏到不能使用的，就按规定手续报废；保管不善的，要改善保管工作。
    指示说，保护耕畜，也是十分重要的工作。特别是受灾地区，耕畜已见瘦弱现象。各级供销社要发挥以往保护耕畜的经验，努力减少耕畜不应有的死亡和瘦弱现象。各地供销社应在今冬调查了解耕畜的供求情况，安排调剂计划，总结已往调剂耕畜的经验，积极做好耕畜调剂工作。为适应农业生产需要和刺激耕畜繁殖，要求耕畜产区和多畜地区的青海、黑龙江、吉林、贵州等省和新疆、内蒙古两自治区，大力支援农业区需要的耕畜，并早些提出外调计划。
    指示还要求各地供销社必须协助工业、手工业、农业和水利部门，提前在冬季做好水利工具、新式农具、农药械的修配工作。丢失了零件，立即给以补充。经过检修好的农业机具，农业社应该指定专人做好保管保养工作。
