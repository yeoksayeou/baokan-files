Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 26th: The No. 1 blast furnace of the Shaoxing Branch of Zhejiang Iron and Steel Plant was completed and ignited on the evening of the 24th, and the first batch of high-quality pig iron was produced on the 25th.

This blast furnace took only eight months from surveying and design to construction and ignition to iron production.

A total of four blast furnaces will be built in the Shaoxing Branch. After all four blast furnaces are completed in January next year, they can produce 40,000 tons of pig iron annually.

The general plant of Zhejiang Iron and Steel Plant is located in Hang County. The blast furnace, hot blast stove, iron-smelting workshop, and steel-making workshop in its first phase of construction are now under intense construction; it is expected that after some of the projects (including the Shaoxing Branch) are put into production in the first quarter of next year, they can produce 80,000 tons of pig iron annually. In the future, this plant will be gradually expanded according to needs. (Attached picture)

    鲁迅故乡建了一座高炉
    新华社杭州26日电　浙江钢铁厂绍兴分厂一号高炉在24日晚建成点火，25日出了第一炉质地优良的生铁。
    这座高炉从勘测设计到施工到点火出铁，只花了八个月的时间。
    绍兴分厂共要兴建四座高炉。到明年1月四座高炉全部建成以后，可以年产四万吨生铁。
    浙江钢铁厂总厂设在杭县。它的第一期工程中的高炉、热风炉、炼铁车间和炼钢车间，现在正紧张施工；预计明年第一季度部分工程（包括绍兴分厂）投入生产以后，可以年产八万吨生铁。今后，这个厂将根据需要逐步扩建。（附图片）
