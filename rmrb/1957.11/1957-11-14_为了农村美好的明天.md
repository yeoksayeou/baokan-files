For a Bright Tomorrow in the Countryside
By our reporter Wen Tianshen

    In late August, the Taiyangsheng Agricultural Cooperative in Gaiping County, Liaoning Province, was in the midst of a bountiful apple harvest.

    One day, Li Mingxin, the deputy secretary of the township's Party General Branch and vice chairman of the Taiyangsheng Agricultural Cooperative, picked up seventeen high school graduates from the station. Soon after, they were assigned to the orchard to work on selecting and packaging apples. The cooperative arranged accommodation for them in members' homes and the supply and marketing cooperative in the Shanghezhai area near the orchard.

    In these short two months, they have grown to love this place. Zhao Dianchen told me, "In the past, we often didn't think much of wind and rain. But now, as soon as the wind blows at night, everyone worries, fearing that the apples will be blown down."

    I will never forget the sincere words that many students shared with me. Miao Fulin, a tall young man and a member of the Communist Youth League, had originally wanted to study navigation, and also considered becoming a judge or an accountant. On the eve of graduation, his father once told him, "Son, there are many paths in life. As long as you take the socialist road, any job will be promising." Encouraged by his father, he gave up his original plans and embarked on the path of agriculture.

    The female student Fu Changchun, originally loved agriculture, but when choosing a path after graduation, she wavered. Neighbors advised her to be a filial child and not leave her mother. However, in the end, she decided to participate in agricultural production and plans to bring her mother here as well.

    In Shanghezhai, I heard many students say, "From the Party branch secretary and director to all the male and female members of the cooperative, everyone cares for us meticulously. Li Zhanyang, the Party branch secretary who has been a farmer for over twenty years, often talks to us to understand our thoughts, and helps us solve problems in our work and life. During breaks, he personally takes the lead in organizing recreational activities. When the veteran cooperative members see that our skills are not proficient, they take the initiative to teach us in the fields."

    They said, "When we first arrived, we didn't know which insects were eating the apple trees. Although we now know a little about fruit tree knowledge and can quickly pick out apples with wormholes as small as pinpricks, sometimes the apple selection still needs to be redone, and we are still far from mastering all the techniques."

    Under the oil lamp, on the warm kang, whenever the students talked about the past, they treated their past thoughts of looking down on agriculture as a joke. Lin Jinyi, a student who grew up in the south, said, "We are now entering an agricultural university. At present, we are studying fruit tree specialization, and there are many other crop technologies waiting for us to master!"

    Of course, sometimes when talking about life with the students, they do not shy away from mentioning that rural life is worse than urban life. But—"That's exactly why the Party wants us to build it." This is what they often mentioned at group meetings.

    I remember once, the cooperative director, in order to take care of the female students, let them leave work one hour earlier than the average cooperative member. However, the students repeatedly requested that this rule be cancelled. They said, "We don't want to be treated differently from the veteran cooperative members in life or work."

    The Taiyangsheng Agricultural Cooperative, like other rural areas in the motherland, has infinitely beautiful prospects. At present, its production has already surpassed the level of well-to-do middle peasants. Soon, electric lights will be installed here, and a club will be built... Isn't what the students are pursuing to have more of their labor in this glorious future?

    为了农村美好的明天
    本报记者　文天申
    八月末，辽宁省盖平县太阳升农业社正是苹果丰收的季节。
    一天，乡的党总支副书记兼太阳升农业社副主席李铭心从车站接来了十七名高中毕业生。不久，他们就被分配到果园担任选果、包装工作。社里为他们在果园附近尚和寨一带社员家、供销社里安上了家。
    在这短短的两个月里，他们就爱上了这里，赵殿臣对我说：“过去我们对刮风下雨常常认为没啥。而现在呢，只要晚上一刮风，大家就耽心，怕苹果被风刮落。”
    我忘不了许多同学和我谈出的真心话。苗福林，这是一个高大身材的青年，共青团员。以前他原想考航海，也曾想当法官和会计师。毕业前夕，他的父亲曾经对他说：“孩子，生活的道路很多，只要走社会主义道路，任何工作都有出息。”在他父亲的鼓励下，他放弃了原来的打算，走上了农业这条生活的道路。
    女同学傅长春，原来是爱好农业的，但在选择毕业出路时，她倒一度动摇了，邻居们劝她做一个孝顺的孩子别离开母亲。但是，最后她还是决定参加农业生产，并且打算把她母亲也接来。
    在尚和寨，我听到不少同学这样说：“我们一来，从党支部书记、主任到所有的男女社员都是无微不至的关心我们。当了二十多年农民的党支部书记李占扬，经常找我们谈心、解决干活、生活上的问题，休息时还亲自带头领我们参加文娱活动。老社员们看到我们技术不熟，就主动在地里教我们。”
    他们说：“初来这里，果树有哪些食心虫？我们不知道。现在虽然了解了一点果树知识，也能很快选出像针眼般虫食的苹果来，但有时选果还要返工，掌握各种技术还差得很远。”
    在油灯下，在热炕头，同学们每谈起过去，就把轻视农业的思想当作笑柄。一位生长在南方的同学林晋益说：“我们现在进的就是农业大学，目前刚学果树专业，还有其它许多农作物技术等着我们去掌握它呢！”
    当然，有时和同学们谈起生活来，他们也不避讳地谈到农村生活比城市差。但——“正是这样，党要我们建设它。”这是他们常在小组生活会上提到的。
    记得有一次，社主任为了照顾女同学，让她们比一般社员提前一小时下工，可是同学们一再要求取消了这一规定，她们说：“我们不要在生活、工作上和老社员有两样。”
    太阳升农业社和祖国其他农村一样，有着无限美好的远景，目前它的生产已经赶过了富裕中农水平。不久，这里要接上电灯，修起俱乐部……。同学们所追求的，不就是要在这光辉的将来，有着他们更多的劳动吗？
