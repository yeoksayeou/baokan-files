Anhui Qimen County Discovery

Strange Fish Climbs Trees to Catch Small Birds

    A fish capable of climbing trees and preying on small birds has been discovered in the streams of Pailouxia and Bafangli in Fufeng Township, Qimen County, Anhui Province.

    This fish resembles a silver carp in shape but is flattened, has extremely small eyes, a wide mouth with sharp teeth, and breathes with lungs. It has no scales or fins. The fish is blackish-gray in color and has four feet on its underside. It ranges from three to six feet in length and generally weighs between two and nine pounds. In the water, this fish likes to eat fish, shrimp, and tadpoles; it can also climb trees and lie motionless, preying on small birds when they are unprepared. When this fish is caught, it makes a sound like a child crying, so the locals call it "Jianyu" (baby fish). Its four claws are like a cat's, so it is also called "Maoyu" (cat fish). Because it can climb trees, it is also called "Feiyu" (flying fish).

    According to the Qimen County Chronicles, this fish was originally called "Yiyu" (winged fish). Its flesh is edible and has an extremely delicious taste.

    安徽祁门县发现
    怪鱼上树捕小鸟
    安徽省祁门县凫峰乡牌楼下、八房里一带溪水中，发现一种能爬树捕食小鸟的鱼。
    这种鱼的形状似鲢而扁，目极小，嘴宽齿锐，用肺呼吸，身上没有鳞、鳍，鱼的颜色发黑带灰，鱼的下部有四足，身长三尺到六尺，体重一般在两斤至九斤之间。这种鱼在水里喜欢吃鱼、虾和蝌蚪；也能爬到树上伏着不动，乘小鸟不备捕食小鸟。这种鱼被捕捉时，发出似小儿哭的声音，因此，当地人叫它“囝鱼”。它四爪如猫，又叫它“猫鱼”，它能爬树，又叫它“飞鱼”。
    据祁门县志载，这种鱼原名“翼鱼”，鱼肉可食，味极鲜美。
