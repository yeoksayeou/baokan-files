    Discussing Sichuan Opera's "Da Hong Tai"
    Xia Jing

    The Sichuan Opera "Da Hong Tai," performed by the Chongqing Sichuan Opera Theater, is a play with the most martial arts performances. It is said to be adapted from the story of "Geng Niang" in Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio. It mainly depicts the story of Xiao Fang, a typical villain who is extremely selfish and does not hesitate to destroy friends and kill his wife for his own benefit. Through Xiao Fang's confession and actions, it illustrates that he is constantly making base plans to achieve the purpose of harming others and benefiting himself. The story is tortuous, and the characterization is detailed.

    The techniques used in this play to depict the villain are worth learning from. From Xiao Fang's appearance, one cannot tell that he is a tyrant. On the contrary, he has the appearance of a handsome scholar. His series of rude behaviors reveals his entire base inner world. Therefore, his friends call him the nickname "Jade Face Tiger," which is not without symbolic meaning. Xiao Fang not only looks good but also often says many beautiful and pleasing words, making people confused by his hypocrisy. This is where the authenticity of the story lies, making people easily believe him and then be deceived by him. The convincing portrayal is that after Xiao Fang does something morally reprehensible, he actually has a moment of conscience, expressing regret. This shows the contradictory side of a character, but it does not detract from the typical character of this thoroughly selfish person. Because he—Xiao Fang—although lamenting his criminal behavior, does not start from the suffering of others but regrets that he has lost both wealth and life, and has been burdened with a crime, and is annoyed that he failed to profit. Therefore, he occasionally tells himself that he should not have committed such evil, but once he encounters an opportunity (such as killing his friend Han Hu for profit), he does so without hesitation. There are also some commendable insertions in the portrayal of this character. For example, after Xiao Fang pushed Jin Dayong and his own wife into the river in the boat in order to possess Jin Dayong's wife, Geng Niang, Geng Niang committed suicide because she was unwilling to submit to Xiao Fang. Xiao Fang cried because of Geng Niang's death. He found that Geng Niang's eyes were not closed even after her death, and he actually said: "Is it because you miss me, Xiao Fang, that you cannot close your eyes?" What a subjective and ridiculous idea! Doesn't he know the reason why Geng Niang died with resentment? In classical drama, this kind of satirical and humorous depiction really opens up broader ideas for the audience.

    The actor Li Xiaolin typified Xiao Fang. His skilled martial arts and acting skills are convincing. Some of the traditional acting methods make us more interested. For example, after he and Jin Dayong became sworn brothers and swore to heaven, he felt guilty and fearful and changed color. His exaggerated performance, coupled with the strong musical rhythm, makes this scene full of terror and strengthens the audience's disgust for a criminal. In addition, as a more ideal requirement for this role, I feel that the performance of the character's inner world is not detailed and realistic enough. Because in addition to exaggerated movements, one must use the face of a hypocrite to cover up his inner ugliness. Only adopting straightforward and rude behavior will reduce the audience's possible belief in this "hypocrite." Secondly, his martial arts movements seem to lack some unique creativity, and the dance movements should be more diversified to suit the special expression method of this play, which is mainly based on martial arts performances.

    What also makes us feel regretful about this play is that the arrangement is not refined enough, and there are many repetitions, especially in the last scene. When the truth has been revealed and the whole play has reached its climax, the ending that people are most concerned about seems to have ended here. Geng Niang's narrative and the crowd's accusation of Xiao Fang are superfluous for the audience, because the audience already understands the development process of the event and does not need the characters in the play to elaborate, while the comments on Xiao Fang's character can be left to the audience. Because the event itself is already the most powerful explanation, this makes the whole play lax and loses its appeal from beginning to end. And will the uglification of Xiao Fang in the last scene weaken the depth of the audience's hatred?

    Furthermore, there are many overly coincidental and exaggerated places in the arrangement and performance methods. In terms of the principle of "exaggeration without losing truth," it seems that there is still room for discussion. What does the whole play require the audience to get? It seems that its focus is not prominent enough. But I don't know if these views are correct?

    谈川剧“打红台”
    夏静
    重庆市川剧院演出的川剧“打红台”是一出武功做作最多的戏。据说这是取材于聊斋中“庚娘”的故事。其中主要描写了一个极其自私、为了一己私利不惜灭友杀妻的暴徒的典型人物——萧方的故事。用萧方的自白，用萧方的行动，说明他无时无刻不在作自己的卑鄙打算以达到损人利己的目的，故事曲折，刻划也是细致的。
    这出戏在描写反派人物的技巧上，是值得我们学习的。从萧方的外形上看不出他是一个暴徒，相反他具有一个长落得清秀的书生模样，而从他一连串的粗暴的行为中展示了他的全部卑劣的内心世界，因此他的朋友称他外号“玉面虎”也不是没有象征意义的。萧方不仅长落得好看，而且常说着许多漂亮动听的话，令人迷惑于他的假仁假义，这就是故事的真实性所在，使人们轻易地相信了他，然后才会受他的欺骗。令人信服的描绘是在萧方作了丧害天良的事之后，居然也有一刹那的天良发现，表示后悔，这是说一个人物的矛盾面，但并无损于这个彻头彻尾自私自利的人物的典型性格，因为他——萧方，虽然在悲怨自己的犯罪行为，却并不是从别人的受损出发，而是可惜自己人财两空，反而背上了罪名，未能得利而恼恨，因此他偶然也对自己说不应该犯下这种罪恶，可是一旦遇到有机可乘（如杀了他的朋友韩虎以求利），他又毫无顾忌地去作了。对于这个人物的描绘也有一些可取的穿插，如萧方因要占有金大用之妻庚娘，在船中把金大用和自己的妻子推下河去之后，庚娘因不愿屈从萧方而自缢，萧方因为庚娘的死而哭泣，他发现庚娘虽死两眼未闭，他竟说：“你是因为想我萧方而不能闭眼的吧？”多么主观而可笑的想法！他难道还不清楚庚娘含恨而死的原因吗？在古典戏剧里这种讽刺幽默的描绘实给观众打开了更广的思路。
    演员李侠林典型地扮演了萧方，他的熟练的武功和表演技巧是能令人信服的，在一些传统的表演方法上使我们更感兴趣，如在他与金大用结拜弟兄对天发誓以后，感到自己心虚胆怯而色变，他那夸大表演，配上强烈的音乐节奏，使这情节充满了恐怖气氛，加强了观众对于一个犯罪者的厌恶。此外，作为我对这一角色更理想的要求，觉得在展示人物内心的表演上还不够细致而真实，因为在夸大动作之外，要用伪善者的面貌来掩盖其内心的丑恶，只采取了直线的粗暴行为，就会减低观众对于这个“伪善者”可能信服的力量。其次，他的武功动作似乎还缺少一些独特的创造，舞蹈动作还应多样化一些，以适于这出戏是以武功做作为主的特殊表现方法。
    这出戏还使我们感到遗憾的是在编排上还不够精练，有许多重复的地方，特别是最后一场，当真象已经大白以后全剧已达最高潮，人们所最关心的结局似已到此为止。庚娘等的叙述以及众人对萧方的责骂，对观众来说已是多余，因为观众早已明白事件的发展过程，勿需剧中人物繁述，而对萧方为人的评论则可留给观众。因为事件的本身已经是最有力量的说明，这样反而使得全剧松弛，失去了它自始至终的吸引力。而最后一场对于萧方的丑化，是否会减弱了观众仇恨的深度？
    再，在编排和表演方法上有许多过分巧合和夸大的地方，以“夸大而不失为真实”的这一原则来说，似还有可商榷。在整出戏来说，要求观众得到的是什么？似乎还不够突出它的重点。但不知这些看法对不？
