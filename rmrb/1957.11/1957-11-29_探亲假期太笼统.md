    Home Visit Leave is Too Vague
    After reading the "Provisional Regulations (Draft) of the State Council Regarding Vacation and Wage Benefits for Workers and Staff Returning Home to Visit Relatives," I deeply feel that the Party and the government's concern for the people is truly meticulous. To make the regulations more comprehensive, I offer two suggestions.
    First, regarding the vacation period. According to the regulations, "Those who need more than ten days for round trip travel time can be given leave once every two years, with a vacation period of five to six weeks." I believe this is too vague. For those whose homes are very far away (such as from the Northeast to Yunnan, where the round trip takes more than thirty days), even if they are given six weeks of leave, they will only be at home for a maximum of twelve days. Those whose round trip takes ten days can be at home for twenty-five to thirty-two days. Those who can visit relatives once a year have a vacation of two to three weeks. If the round trip only takes one to three days, then each year, in addition to being home for twelve to nineteen days for visiting relatives, they can also go home for the Spring Festival, and even for National Day and May Day. Therefore, the time spent visiting relatives for those whose homes are far away differs greatly from those whose homes are nearby. Therefore, I suggest that for those who can use holidays such as the Spring Festival to return home, the vacation period can be reduced appropriately, or even not given. For those whose homes are far away, the vacation period should be extended appropriately based on the length of the journey. It should not be uniformly stipulated that all those who need more than ten days receive five to six weeks.
    Second, regarding the issue of subsidizing travel expenses. According to the regulations, when the round-trip train and boat fares exceed one-third of one's monthly salary (for those who go home once every two years), the administrative side will subsidize one-half of the excess. In this way, it is still much easier for those who live too far away to bring their families over than to visit relatives. Because the round-trip train and boat fare is more than 200 yuan, the administrative subsidy is only a few dozen yuan, at most more than 100 yuan, while one spends more than 100 yuan on train and boat fare, plus nearly 200 yuan on food expenses. Therefore, if we want to give comrades whose homes are too far away the opportunity to go home, the method of subsidizing travel expenses still needs to be studied.

### 探亲假期太笼统

    探亲假期太笼统
    读了“国务院关于工人、职员回家探亲的假期和工资待遇的暂行规定（草案）”我深深感到党和政府对人民的关心真是无微不至。为了使规定更完善，我提两点意见。
    第一是关于假期问题。按规定，“旅途往返所需用的时间在十日以上的，可以每两年给假一次，假期为五个星期至六个星期”。我认为太笼统。家很远的（如东北到云南往返旅途需三十天以上）即使给假六个星期，也才最多在家十二天，旅途需时十天的则可在家二十五至三十二天。每年可以探亲一次的，假期是二至三周，若往返旅途只需时一至三天，那末每年除了探亲在家十二至十九天以外，春节还可回家，甚至国庆“五一”也可以回家。所以，家远的比家近的探亲时间相差太大了。因此，我建议，对可利用春节等假日回家的，可酌情少给假期，甚至不给假期，对家远的应根据旅途的长短适当延长假期，不能笼统规定十日以上的一律是五个至六个星期。
    第二是关于补助车船费问题。按规定，往返车、船费超过本人月工资三分之一时（两年回家一次者），由行政方面补助超过部分的二分之一。照这样，路太远的还是接家属来比探亲要容易多了。因为往返车船费要二百多元，行政补助仅几十元，最多一百多元，而自己除了花车船费一百多元，再加上膳费将近二百元。所以若要使家太远的同志也有回家的机会，路费补助费办法还有研究的必要。
