    Canine Humanitarianism
  　Ruan Yan Shun
    Because the second artificial satellite carried a dog "to determine whether human beings are safe for rocket travel," it is said to have aroused the "anger" of "humanitarians" "from New York to Naples, from San Francisco to Singapore." They spat and frothed, scolding the Soviets as "cruel," "vicious," "terrible," "despicable," "inhuman," "repugnant," "devils"... In short, every vicious word they could think of was hurled at the Soviets. Scolding was not enough; they also wanted to "protest" and "demonstrate," and even mobilize the "U.S. State Department" and the "United Nations." It was as if they would not be able to show their irreconcilable hatred for the Soviets without doing so.
    The Western and Western-style Eastern gentlemen, ladies, and misses went crazy, and the Western news agencies lived up to their reputation as faithful megaphones, sending out telegrams one after another, as if this were the most "important" event in the world today. As a result, we were able to enjoy the most hilarious performance of an "international grand circus."
    After laughing, one cannot help but think: Why are the Western "humanitarians" making such a big fuss? According to themselves, it is to "condemn this atrocity on behalf of all defenseless animals in the world." Mrs. Enzinger, an American "humanitarian," said: "The Russians say the dog is still alive. Isn't that terrible? It may be howling, very lonely, and disoriented by the fear of darkness." According to the Associated Press, "the barking of the Russian dog heard around the world" also prompted Miss Taylor in the United States to comment "terrible." Some people even held a minute of "silence" to mourn the still-living dog as if they had lost their parents. Their "understanding of heaven's virtue of cherishing life" and their spirit of standing up for dogs should be regarded as a highly developed expression of orthodox "humanitarianism."
    However, I am skeptical. According to Reuters, the "Singapore Small Dog Welfare Association" telegraphed the Soviet Union, suggesting that "Soviet heroes" be sent into the sky instead of using "helpless mute animals for experiments." No matter how much Western-style "humanitarians" hate "Soviet heroes," they cannot deny that "Soviet heroes" are also human beings. For the "welfare" of puppies, it is suggested that people be used for experiments, and this is attributed to "humanity." What exactly is this "humanity"? According to the Associated Press, Mrs. Enzinger, who lives in Little Rock, Arkansas, in the United States, also advocated sending people to experiment and opposed using dogs for experiments. The reason is that people can "decide for themselves" whether they are willing to go, while dogs "after all have no chance to say whether they are willing." But we have not forgotten that Mrs. Enzinger's residence is the place where the abuse and murder of black people has caused uproar, and the world knows all about it. In the United States, those black people who were beaten, killed, and hanged, did anyone hear this "benevolent" lady come out to protest whether they had expressed their willingness to be hanged before they died? Then where did "humanity" go? It is said that they love and protect only "all the animals in the world that cannot speak," and the animals that can speak are not in their protection. Therefore, even the experiments of American imperialism using living people for germ warfare are not protested by them. "Dogs are more important than people," "animals that cannot speak are more important than animals that can speak" is the true formula of Western "humanitarianism," which can only be called "canine humanitarianism."
    However, I also have doubts about this "canine humanitarianism." For more than a hundred years, Western scientists and doctors have also used animals that cannot speak for experiments (using living people for experiments is only an invention of the imperialists), but I have not heard of any demonstrations or protests. Why, when the Soviet Union sent a dog into space, did it become intolerable to these "canine humanitarians"?
    The answer is not difficult to find. Although "canine humanitarians" are laymen in science, they are experts in politics. When the dog in the second satellite made the American president, officials, and generals unable to say even "the stupidest words of the century," the "canine humanitarians" found a new topic to make a big fuss about and show off. However, the fact that the "canine humanitarians" have drawn the battle line so long also proves the precarious situation of the entire capitalist world.
    Previously, in a short article (see People's Daily, October 18), I asserted that the "nonsense" of the American president, officials, and generals about the first artificial satellite was a new means after the bankruptcy of armed intervention and atomic blackmail, and this new means would also go bankrupt. In less than a month, the second satellite prompted those "nonsense" to go completely bankrupt. However, I was wrong to predict that after the "nonsense" went bankrupt, there would only be praying to God left. At that time, I did not see that there were such precious "masters" and precious "madams" among the Western and Western-style people who could play tricks that were even more despicable and inferior than the president's "nonsense."
    "Nonsense" is followed by "canine humanitarianism" after bankruptcy, but Mrs. Enzinger, a canine humanitarian, has also asserted that "canine humanitarianism" will also go bankrupt, "this will be like imagining that shouting can make it rain." With this experience, we can see that Westerners will have even newer tricks to play in the future. Although I don't know what these tricks will be, it is certain that they will become more and more despicable and indecent. It is already very sad to tie the fate of the capitalist world to "canine humanitarianism," let alone something worse than that!

    狗道主义
  　阮延顺
    由于第二颗人造卫星上带有一只“探明人类作火箭旅行是否安全”的狗，据说已引起“从纽约到那不勒斯，从旧金山到新嘉坡”的“人道主义”者的“愤怒”。他们唾沫四溅，大骂苏联人“残忍”、“狠毒”、“可怕”、“卑鄙”、“不人道”、“令人憎厌”、“魔王”……总之，能想得起的恶毒字眼都喷射到苏联人头上去了；骂还不算，还要“抗议”，“游行示威”，而且要把“美国国务院”和“联合国”也发动起来。好像不这样就显不出是同苏联人有不共戴天之仇似的。
    西方的和西方式的东方绅士、夫人、小姐们发神经，西方的各大通讯社也不愧为他们忠实的传声筒，一齐连续地大发电讯，好像这是当前世界上最“伟大”的事件。结果，使我们借此饱看了一场“国际大马戏团”最滑稽的演出。
    发笑之后，不禁也想一想：西方的“人道主义”者，为什么要这样大发作？据他们自己说，是为了“代表全世界无防御能力的动物谴责这种暴行”。美国的“人道主义”者恩津格夫人说：“俄国人说这只狗还活着。那不是很可怕吗？它可能在哀叫，很孤独和由于惧怕黑暗而失神。”据合众社说，“全世界都听到的俄国狗的吠声”使美国的泰勒小姐也发出了“可怕呀”的评论。有些人还如丧考妣一般地为那只健在的狗预作一分钟的“静默”志哀。他们的这种“体上天好生之德”和代狗仗义的精神，大概应算作是一种正统的“人道主义”的高度表现吧。
    然而我却怀疑。据路透社说：“新嘉坡小狗福利协会”致电苏联，建议把“苏联英雄”送入高空，而不要拿“无助的哑吧动物作实验”。不管西方式的“人道主义”者怎样痛恨
  “苏联英雄”，但总不能不承认“苏联英雄”也是人。为了小狗的“福利”，建议用人去作实验，还要把这归之“人道”二字。这“人道”究竟是什么？据合众社说：住在美国阿肯色州小石城的恩津格夫人，也主张把人送去作试验，反对用狗作试验。理由是人可以“自行决定”是否愿意前去，而狗“毕竟没有机会来说出它们是否愿意”。但我们都还没有忘记：这位恩津格夫人的住处，正是为了虐杀黑人闹得满城风雨尽世皆知的地方，在美国，那些被打杀，被吊死的黑人，不知在死前曾否表示过他们愿意被吊死？谁也没有听到过这位“仁慈”的夫人出来抗议，那末“人道”又跑到什么地方去了呢？据说，他们所热爱和保护的只是“世上一切不会说话的动物”，至于会说话的动物是不在他们保护之列的。因此就连美帝国主义用活人作细菌战的实验，他们也是不抗议的。“狗重于人”，“不会说话的动物重于会说话的动物”正是西方“人道主义”者的真正公式，这其实是只能叫作“狗道主义”的。
    然而，我对这“狗道主义”也还有怀疑。百多年来，西方的科学家和医学家们，也是用不会说话的动物作实验的（用活人作试验只是帝国主义者的创举），却也没听到什么示威和抗议，为什么，苏联送了一只狗上天旅行，就变得使这些“狗道主义”者不能容忍了呢？
    这答案也不难找。“狗道主义”者虽然是科学上的外行，却是政治上的内行。当第二颗卫星里的狗，使得美国总统、官员、将军们，连“本世纪中最愚蠢的话”也说不出的时候“狗道主义”者却找到了大作文章的新题目，来一显身手了。然而“狗道主义”者的战线拉得这么长，却也证明着整个资本主义世界处境的不妙。
    前此，我在一篇短文里（见10月18日人民日报）曾断言：美国总统、官员、将军们关于第一颗人造卫星的“扯淡”，是武装干涉和原子讹诈破产后的新手段，而且这新手段也还要破产。还不到一个月，第二颗卫星，就促使那些“扯淡”彻底破产了。但是，我预言“扯淡”破产之后，便只剩下了祷告上帝，却是错了。当时我并没有看到西方的和西方式的人中，还有着这么一批宝贝“爷”们和宝贝“娘”们，能耍出比总统的“扯淡”更为卑鄙下贱的把戏来。
    “扯淡”破产以后是“狗道主义”，但狗道主义者——恩津格夫人也已断言，“狗道主义”也要破产，“这将是想像用大叫来使天下雨”一样。有了这一次的经验，我们可以看到西方人将来还会有更新的花样耍出来，我虽然不知这花样将是什么，但越来越卑鄙、下流总是肯定了的。把资本主义世界的命运维系于“狗道主义”上，已是十分可悲的了，何况还要比这更坏呢！
