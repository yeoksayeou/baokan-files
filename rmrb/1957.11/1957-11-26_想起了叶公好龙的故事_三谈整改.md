	Reminded of the Story of Lord Ye Who Loved Dragons
	——A Third Discussion on Rectification	Xu Bangyi
	Fully mobilizing the masses is necessary for the anti-Rightist struggle, and fully mobilizing the masses is also necessary for rectification. This is a theorem. Recently, rectification in many agencies and units has formed a wave of enthusiasm. Through rectification, problems that could not be solved for many years have been solved all at once, problems that were not thoroughly solved for many years have been thoroughly solved this time, work has been improved, relationships have been closer, unity has been strengthened, initiative has been mobilized, awareness has been raised, and many things have become easier to handle. Everything looks new, which is exciting! Full of vigor, which is encouraging!

	Relying on the masses, believing in the majority of the masses, and following the mass line are the keys to achieving success in all tasks. Those who do so will definitely do well; those who do not do so will definitely not do well. The anti-Rightist struggle and rectification work are no exceptions.

	However, some people have not fully understood the idea of mobilizing the masses for rectification and still have resistance in their actions. There are leaders in such units who get angry when they see the masses posting big-character posters about them and when the masses offer sharp criticisms. They question the masses: "Did you clarify the situation before writing the big-character posters?" One leader, seeing that the masses have many opinions about him, even expressed that he would lie down and do nothing. In short, they are afraid of the masses and afraid of getting burned. Although they usually talk about how great the power of the masses is, they shrink back when the masses are mobilized. Everyone knows the story of Lord Ye who loved dragons. Some of us are like Lord Ye. I ask, can a communist who is afraid of the masses still be a true communist? If a communist truly deserves to be called a communist, he must love the real dragon – the masses.

	To carry out rectification, we must do everything possible to mobilize the masses. Only by mobilizing the masses can we expose shortcomings, problems, and contradictions in all aspects; if we do not vigorously organize bottom-up mass criticism, bureaucracy, sectarianism, and subjectivism will have a place to hide. Only by mobilizing the masses can we have the confidence and effectiveness to improve our work. There are many, many areas where the work of any unit needs to be improved, and various opinions for improving the work can be put forward in dozens, hundreds, or even thousands. To truly reform, to reform well, to reform thoroughly, and to reform steadily, it is difficult to achieve results if only a few leaders reform while the broad masses only offer opinions without taking part in the reformation. Rectification must mobilize everyone to come up with ideas and methods, and everyone must work together to reform. Of course, leaders must bear the responsibility of leadership, and leaders must take the lead in reforming, supporting reform, and leading reform.

	Undoubtedly, mobilizing the masses is a very "troublesome" task. Before mobilizing, it is not easy to dispel the various concerns of the masses and encourage them to speak boldly. This requires a lot of work, and it cannot be mobilized simply by "calling" out, "Everyone, please speak your mind." The masses are very sensitive to the attitude of the leaders, and the masses can see whether the leaders sincerely want to reform or are just pretending. Only when the leaders sincerely want to reform can the masses speak their "inner thoughts" without any worries. And after mobilization, the masses will put forward various different opinions, some correct, some incorrect; some too high, some too urgent; some reasonable, some unreasonable; this requires the leaders to have a clear head, to carefully analyze and consider various opinions, to believe in the majority of the masses, and to lead the debate of different opinions among the masses. What should be changed must be resolutely changed, and what should not be changed must be persuaded and educated. What should be changed but the conditions are not sufficient must be explained. Being afraid of "trouble," simplification, and rudeness are harmful to the cause of the Party.

	Mobilizing the masses and carrying out criticism may damage the "self-esteem" of some leaders and may cause some leaders to feel sad and dissatisfied, but there is no other way, because the interests of the Party and the people are above all else. Starting from this point, all problems will be easy to understand.

    想起了叶公好龙的故事
    ——三谈整改	许邦仪
    反右派要充分发动群众，整改也要充分发动群众。这是一条定理。最近很多机关和很多单位的整改已经形成了热潮，经过整改，多年解决不了的问题一下子解决了，多年解决不彻底的问题这一次彻底地解决了，工作改进了，关系密切了，团结增强了，积极性发动了，觉悟性提高了，许多事情好办了。气象一新，令人兴奋！朝气勃勃，令人鼓舞！
    依靠群众，相信群众的多数，走群众路线，这是各项工作取得成就的关键。凡是这样做的，就一定做得好；凡是不这样做的，就一定做得不好。反右派斗争和整改工作，都不例外。
    不过，有人对于发动群众进行整改，在思想上并没有完全弄通，在行动上还有抵触情绪。有这样一个单位的领导人，看到群众贴他的大字报，群众对他提的意见尖锐一点，他就发火了，他就责问群众：“写大字报，你们弄清情况了吗？”有一个领导人，看到群众对他提的意见很多，竟然表示要躺倒不干。总之，他们是怕群众、怕火烧身。尽管他们平时在嘴上讲群众力量有多么大多么大，可是，一当群众发动起来了，他们反而就畏缩了。大家都知道叶公好龙的故事。我们有一些人就好像叶公一样。试问一个共产主义者害怕群众，还成为真正的共产主义者吗？一个共产主义者要真正名副其实成为一个共产主义者，就要爱真正的龙——群众。
    搞整改，就要千方百计把群众发动起来。只有把群众发动起来，才能揭露各方面的缺点、问题和矛盾；如果不大力组织自下而上的群众性的批评，官僚主义、宗派主义和主观主义，就会有藏身之所。也只有把群众发动起来，才能有把握和有效地改进工作。任何一个单位的工作需要改进的地方是很多很多的，改进工作的各种意见可以提出几十条。几百条甚至几千条。要真正地改，要改得好、改得狠、改得稳，光凭少数几个领导人去改，广大的群众只管提意见而不管改，那是很难收效的。整改一定要发动大家出主意、想办法，还要大家一道动手改。当然，领导者要负有领导的责任，领导者要带头改、支持改和领导改。
    无疑的，发动群众，是很“麻烦”的工作。在发动之前，要解除群众的各种顾虑，要群众敢于大胆讲话，并不十分容易，这要做很多的工作，并不是“号召”一下“大家有什么意见就讲吧”就可以发动起来的；群众对领导者的态度是十分敏感的，领导者是真心想改还是假心想改，群众是会看得出来的。只有当领导者是真心想改，群众才能毫无顾虑地讲出“心里话”。而在发动之后，群众中间又会提出各种不同意见，有正确的，有不正确的；有过高的，有过急的；有合理的，有不合理的；这就要求领导者有冷静的头脑，要对各种意见加以仔细的分析和考虑，要相信群众的大多数，要有领导地在群众中间展开不同意见的辩论，该改的就坚决改，不该改的就要说服教育，该改而条件不够的就要解释说明。怕“麻烦”、简单化、粗暴，是有害于党的事业的。
    发动群众，开展批评，可能会损害某些领导人员的“自尊心”，可能会引起某些领导人员的难过和不满，而这是没有办法的，因为党的和人民的利益还是高于一切的。从这一点出发，什么问题都会容易想通的。
