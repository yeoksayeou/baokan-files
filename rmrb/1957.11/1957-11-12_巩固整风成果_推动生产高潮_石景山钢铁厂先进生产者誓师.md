Xinhua News Agency report: The Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant held an advanced producers' conference on the 6th to promote the production upsurge that gradually formed during the plant's rectification campaign, and to comprehensively overfulfill this year's production increase and conservation plan.

Lai Ruoyu, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, spoke at the meeting. Lai Ruoyu said that after the rectification campaign, a new upsurge in production has begun to arrive at this factory, and in the future, this upsurge should be promoted to develop more steadily forward.

Lai Ruoyu said that three conditions are needed to form a production upsurge: first, the universal high enthusiasm of the workers; second, the leadership pointing out the goals of struggle; and third, in-depth and meticulous organizational work. Based on the analysis of these three conditions, the emergence of a new production upsurge at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant is entirely hopeful.

Lai Ruoyu also talked about the issue of consolidating the achievements of the rectification campaign in the future. He said that the spirit of the masses in promoting democracy and the working methods of leading cadres in following the mass line should be continued; the work of the workers' representative assembly and group meetings should be strengthened to make them a system.

Cao Xianbo, chairman of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant Trade Union, hoped that all advanced producers and veteran workers would unite and lead all the plant's employees to achieve a complete victory on both the rectification and production fronts.

An Chaojun, the vice-director of the factory, on behalf of the administrative side, raised the key issues in production for the fourth quarter at the meeting, and asked the advanced producers and all employees to carefully study and solve them.

The advanced producers, veteran workers, and leading cadres from various workshops who attended the meeting conducted a heated discussion on how to push the production upsurge forward. Many units put forward competition guarantee conditions at the meeting.
