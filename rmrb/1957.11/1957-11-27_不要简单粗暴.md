A noteworthy situation has arisen in some units of the Ministry of Foreign Trade during the upsurge of cadres requesting to be sent down to lower levels. In the China National Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Export Corporation, a female cadre named Zhang Qi was the only one in her unit who did not sign up for labor participation when everyone else did. People mobilized her to sign up, but she didn't. Later, some people even beat drums and gongs to challenge her to sign up, but she still didn't. Finally, people put up big-character posters criticizing her, still wanting her to sign up.

A similar situation occurred at the China National Animal By-Products Import & Export Corporation. A female cadre was unwilling to go down to the lower levels, and the masses put up big-character posters calling her a "deserter of socialism."

If some cadres, based on the situation in the organization and their own circumstances, need to temper themselves through labor immediately, but their thinking is not yet aligned, we should only persuade and educate them. We should never adopt the methods used by the China National Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Export Corporation and the China National Animal By-Products Import & Export Corporation. The rectification leadership group of the Ministry of Foreign Trade has rightly pointed out the error of this approach and corrected it, which is very necessary. As for adopting methods such as beating drums and gongs and issuing challenges when mobilizing cadres to go down to lower levels, this is also undesirable, because this superficial show of enthusiasm can easily obscure some problems that need to be resolved carefully.

    不要简单粗暴
    对外贸易部有些单位在干部要求下放的热潮中发生了一种值得引起注意的情况。中国粮谷油脂出口公司有个女干部叫张奇，这次她所在单位的同志全都报名要求参加劳动，就她一人未报。大家动员她报名，她不报；后来有人又敲锣打鼓向她挑战，要她报名，她还是不报。最后大家就给她贴大字报，还是要她报名。
    中国畜产公司也有类似情况。有一个女干部不愿下放，群众就给她贴大字报，说她是“社会主义的逃兵”。
    如果有些干部，根据机关中的情况和他们本身的情况需要马上到劳动中锻炼而他们思想还不通的话，只能对他们进行说服教育，绝不应该采取中国粮谷油脂出口公司和中国畜产公司的作法。外贸部整风领导小组已经指出这种作法的错误并加以纠正是很必要的。至于在动员干部下放时，采取敲锣打鼓，挑战应战的办法同样是不足取的，因为这种表面上的轰轰烈烈很容易把一些需要细致解决的问题掩盖起来。
