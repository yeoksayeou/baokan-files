    "Giants" on the Salsk Steppe
    By Dai Feng, Our Correspondent

    Before the October Revolution, the Salsk Steppe in the Don River region was mostly barren black soil, devoid of trees and water. Throughout the year, dry winds blew from the desert regions along the Caspian Sea, making the weather dry and hot, with very little rain. During the Tsarist era, there was a saying popular on the Salsk Steppe: "Grass grows but no grain, cattle and horses pass by with no water to gain."

    After the victory of the October Revolution, farmers from various regions gradually moved to the Salsk Steppe. The Soviet regime granted them land for the first time. At that time, individual farmers in the Salsk region, like those in other areas, struggled to achieve good harvests due to backward farming techniques, a lack of means of production, and the constraints of natural conditions. To improve agricultural production and promote agricultural collectivization, the Soviet regime carried out a comprehensive socialist transformation of agriculture. In July 1928, the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party passed the resolution: "To establish new (grain) state farms." The first farm established was the "Giant" state farm on the Salsk Steppe in the Rostov region.

    In the hot August days of 1928, the first pioneers arrived on the Salsk Steppe: workers, members of the Communist Youth League, and young students. Responding to the Party's call, they voluntarily organized the first reclamation team and came here to build the farm. Just as the farm workers were working hard to transform nature, despite the difficulties in their lives, foreign bourgeois elements mockingly clamored: "The Soviet regime will be buried along with the 'Giant' farm..."

    More than four hundred agricultural machines, bought with gold by the Soviet government, were transported to the farm in 1929. There were eleven brands of tractors. The plows, harrows, and disc seeders were of different sizes and inefficient. In particular, the American wheeled tractors were cumbersome, difficult to use, and consumed a lot of fuel. Farm workers, lacking technical experience, could only modify the machines before using them. To prevent drought, the workers dug artificial lakes and artesian wells. To prevent wind, the workers planted trees everywhere. ... The pioneers worked tirelessly day and night for four months, sowing the first batch of winter crops on 11,500 hectares of newly reclaimed land. In the spring of 1929, another 48,300 hectares of spring wheat were sown. In late summer, combines turned amidst the golden waves of crops. The farm workers invited the surrounding farmers to celebrate the first harvest: an average of eight quintals of grain per hectare. In 1931, Professor Vilison of the United States specially came to visit the farm. After looking around in detail, he stood on the ridge of a field, waved his hat at the workers, and said loudly: "You have won!"

    The "Giant" farm was established at a time when farmers were actively discussing the organization of collective farms. Some farmers who had just been allocated land doubted the benefits of collectivization. In addition to reclaiming large areas of wasteland, excavating twelve artificial lakes, and building more than two hundred hectares of windbreaks, the "Giant" farm, from the first year of its establishment, annually sent out excellent tractor drivers with tractors to help surrounding farmers plow their land and assist in the establishment of collective farms. The large-scale collective mechanized farming of the farm concretely educated the farmers, making them realize that collectivization and mechanization were the only ways to increase production and completely escape poverty. In 1931, 110,000 farmers from various places visited the farm. The visitors saw with their own eyes: what was once a wasteland was now an endless expanse of wheat fields and workers' villages. This unforgettable impression had a profound impact on promoting agricultural collectivization and mechanization.

    Soon after the establishment of the "Giant" farm, a nationwide upsurge in agricultural collectivization arrived. In addition to helping the surrounding farmers build agricultural cooperatives, in 1930, according to the Party's instructions, the "Giant" farm sent a mechanized farming team of four hundred workers to the Urals to support the newly established agricultural cooperatives, helping to cultivate and sow 30,000 hectares of land, promoting the local collectivization movement. Because the support for the mechanized farming team was so good, on their way back, when they passed through Moscow, Kalinin personally presented them with a red flag embroidered with the words: "Under this flag, use socialist competition as a weapon to strive for socialist agriculture to better serve national industrialization." In 1930, to reward the heroic labor of the workers of the "Giant" farm, the Soviet government awarded the farm the Order of Lenin.

    The farm developed year by year. One day in 1933, the farm workers happily welcomed the first batch of domestically produced "Stalinets" combines like they were welcoming a bride. Afterwards, various domestically produced tractors were successively transported to replace all the foreign tractors. This gave the farm a solid technical foundation. Production increased year by year.

    The war interrupted the farm's production.

    "This is the masterpiece of fascism." The farm director said to us, pointing to the destroyed ruins of a four-story building: "Twenty-four buildings were burned like this. Only a pile of rubble remained of the farm's theater, college, and hospital. The fascist bandits also attempted to prevent us from rebuilding a peaceful life here, even burning down three hundred and twenty-four hectares of windbreaks that had been cultivated with ten years of hard work, and blowing up the artesian wells..."

    The war brought serious damage to the farm. The first year of recovery was difficult, with no machines and insufficient manpower. The workers worked day and night, and only achieved the first harvest in 1947. From 1948 onwards, a large number of new agricultural machines were transported in. The farm was restored and developed. Today, the farm has 38,000 hectares of grain arable land, more than 3,000 hectares of orchards, and large pastures. The farm annually increases its production of grain at a very low cost.

    After the war, the farm experimented with and created a series of new cultivation methods to strive to increase yield per unit area, implemented a grass-arable rotation system in cultivation, and adopted a two-stage harvesting method in harvesting. These advanced cultivation methods were quickly promoted in various agricultural cooperatives.

    Farm director Engelvieff accompanied us on a tour of the farm. Because the farm covers a very large area, it is divided into twelve branches and eighteen residential areas for easy management. The farthest distance between branches is thirteen kilometers. After passing through the wide streets and neatly constructed "urban area" of the farm headquarters, we came to the square, same-sized fields, with windbreaks like a high wall tightly surrounding the area. Artificial reservoirs are distributed between the ridges.

    When visiting the mechanized pigsty, the farm director told us that the farm's livestock development was still after the war. After the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party decided to vigorously develop agriculture and animal husbandry in September 1953, the farm's animal husbandry truly developed. Now there are 1,800 dairy cows, 18,500 pigs, 6,700 cattle, and a large number of chickens.

    The farm has developed, and the lives of the farm workers are getting better day by day. Tractor drivers and combine operators earn an average monthly salary of 1,600 rubles. We visited many workers' families, well-equipped hospitals, five-story tenth-grade schools, kindergartens, a stadium with 1,500 seats, clubs, etc., leaving us with a clear impression: rural workers are living a happy life that they have never had before, just like urban workers.

    In the drizzle, we walked through a green square and saw the towering Gorky monument in the center of the square. In 1929, he came here and made a loud voice: "Comrades, what does the 'Giant' tell us? I think it tells us - the working class is indeed a giant, a young giant who has been elected to complete unprecedented tasks, and who has shown within a year that this giant can not only manage factories, but also manage farms..."

    The working people of the Soviet era are true giants in conquering nature and creating a happy life. Thirty years ago, the first "Giant" appeared on the Salsk Steppe. Today, more than 5,000 "Giants" have appeared throughout the Soviet Union. This is a large army for developing Soviet agricultural production, and also a large army for transforming agriculture towards communism.

### 萨里草原上的“巨人”

    萨里草原上的“巨人”
    本报记者　戴枫
    十月革命前，顿河流域的萨里草原，大部分土地是没有树、没有水的干旱的黑土生荒地。一年四季，从里海沿岸沙漠地区刮来旱风，天气干燥酷热，很少下雨。沙皇时代，萨里草原流行着一句顺口溜：“长草不长粮，牛马走过没水尝。”
    十月革命胜利后，萨里草原上陆续迁来了各地的农民。苏维埃政权使他们第一次获得了土地。那时，萨里地区的个体农民正像其他地区一样，由于耕作技术落后，缺乏生产资料和自然条件的阻碍，辛苦一年，难得个好收成。为了提高农业生产和促进农业集体化，苏维埃政权进行了全面性的社会主义农业改造。1928年7月苏联共产党中央全会通过了：“设立新的（谷物的）国营农场”的决议。接着第一个建立的农场就是罗斯托夫州萨里草原上的“巨人”国营农场。
    1928年炎热的8月天，萨里荒地上来到了第一批拓荒者：工人、共青团员和青年学生。他们响应了党的号召，自愿地组织了第一支开垦队，来到这里建场。正当农场工人们不顾生活上的困难，紧张劳动改造着大自然时，外国资产阶级讥讽地叫嚣：“苏维埃政权会与‘巨人’农场一起葬送……”
    苏维埃政府用金子买来的四百多架农业机器在1929年运到了农场。拖拉机有十一个牌号。犁、耙、圆盘播种机都大小不一，效率很低。特别是美国的轮式拖拉机，笨重不好使，又耗油。技术经验不足的农场工人，只能将机器加以改造，然后使用。为了防旱，工人们开起人工湖、自流井。为了防风，工人们到处植树。……开垦者日以继夜地辛勤劳动了四个月，在一万一千五百公顷新垦地上第一批播下了冬季作物的种子。1929年春天，又播种了四万八千三百公顷春小麦。夏末，在金波翻腾的庄稼中转动着收割机。农场工人邀请了周围的农民一起庆祝了第一次的丰收：每公顷土地平均收了八公担粮食。1931年美国维里逊教授特地来农场参观。他在到处详细看过之后，站在田垅上，挥动着帽子向工人们高声说：“你们胜利了”。
    “巨人”农场建立之时，正值农民纷纷讨论着组织集体农庄的时候。有些刚刚分得了土地的农民怀疑集体化的好处。“巨人”农场建立初期除了大量开垦了荒地，开凿了十二个人工湖，建造了二百多公顷防风林外。同时，从建场第一年起，年年都派出优秀的拖拉机手，带上拖拉机帮助周围农民翻耕土地，协助成立集体农庄。农场大规模集体机械化耕作具体地教育着农民，使他们认识到集体化、机械化是提高产量彻底摆脱贫穷的唯一途径。1931年到农场参观的各地农民有十一万人。参观者亲眼见到了：不久前还是一片荒地，现在已是一望无际的麦地和工人村。这种难忘的印象在促进农业集体化和机械化起了深远的影响。
    “巨人”农场建立不久，全国农业集体化高潮到来了，“巨人”农场除了帮助四周农民建起了农庄外，1930年，根据党的指示，又派出了有四百工人组成的机耕队，到乌拉尔支援新建立的农庄，帮助耕耘、播种了三万公顷土地，促进了当地集体化运动。由于支援机耕队工作得好，他们在归途中经过莫斯科时，加里宁亲自把一面绣着：“在这面旗帜下，以社会主义竞赛为武器，争取社会主义的农业更好地为国家工业化而奋斗。”的红旗授给了他们。1930年，为奖励“巨人”农场工人的英勇劳动，苏联政府授予了这个农场列宁勋章。
    农场一年年发展着。1933年的一天，农场工人兴高采烈地像迎接新娘一样迎接了第一批的国产“斯大林涅茨”收割机。之后，陆续运到各种国产拖拉机，代替了所有的外国拖拉机。这才使农场技术上有了巩固的基础。产量逐年提高。
    战争中断了农场的生产。
    “这就是法西斯的杰作。”农场场长指着被炸毁的一座四层楼的断墙残壁向我们说：“这样被烧毁的房屋有二十四幢。农场的剧院、学院、医院只留下一片瓦砾。法西斯匪徒还企图不让我们在这里重建和平生活，竟把十年心血培植的三百二十四公顷防风林焚烧殆尽，自流井也炸了……”
    战争给农场带来了严重的毁坏。第一年的恢复工作是困难的，没有机器，人力不够。工人们日夜工作，到1947年才获得了第一次收成。1948年起，大批农业新机器运来了。农场恢复发展了。到今天，农场已拥有三万八千公顷谷物耕地，三千多公顷果园，大片牧场。农场每年增产着成本很低的谷物。
    战后，农场试验创造了一系列争取提高单位面积产量的新耕作法，在耕作上实行了草田轮作制，在收割上采用了分段收割法。这些先进的耕作法很快在各个农庄推广了。
    场长安格尔维夫陪着我们在农场参观。因为农场占地面积非常大，为了便于管理，分为十二个分场，十八个居民区。分场之间最远的间隔距离有十三公里。我们穿过了街道宽阔、建筑整齐的场本部“市区”后，来到了方正正、大小相同的田间，防风林像一垛高高的围墙紧围着四周。人工贮水池分布在田垅之间。
    在参观机械化了的猪舍时，场长告诉我们：农场发展畜牧业还是在战后。1953年9月苏共中央全会决定大力发展农业、畜牧业后，农场的畜牧业才真正的发展起来。现在已有乳牛一千八百头，猪一万八千五百头，牛六千七百头，还有大量的鸡群。
    农场发展了，农场工人生活一天比一天好。拖拉机手，联合收割机手每月平均工资为一千六百卢布。我们参观了许多工人家庭、设备完善的医院、五层楼的十年级学校，托儿所，一千五百位子的运动场，俱乐部等，留给我们鲜明的印象：农村工人与城市工人一样过着从未有过的幸福生活。
    在细雨里，我们走过绿茵一片的广场，看到广场正中耸立着的高尔基纪念像。1929年，就是他来到这里发出了洪亮的声音：“同志们，‘巨人’告诉了我们什么呢？我觉得，它告诉了我们——工人阶级确是巨人，是被推举出来完成空前任务的年轻的巨人，在一年之内就显示出，这个巨人不但会管理工厂，而且也会管理农场……”
    苏维埃时代的劳动人民是征服自然、创造幸福生活的真正巨人。三十年前第一个“巨人”出现在萨里草原。今天，全苏各地已出现了五千多个“巨人”了。这是一支发展苏维埃农业生产的大军，也是改造农业走向共产主义的大军。
