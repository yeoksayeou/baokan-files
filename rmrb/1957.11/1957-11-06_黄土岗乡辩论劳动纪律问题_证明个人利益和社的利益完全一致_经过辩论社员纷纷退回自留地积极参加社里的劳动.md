Huangtugang Township Debates Labor Discipline Issues
Proving That Individual Interests and the Collective's Interests Are Completely Aligned
After the debate, commune members returned their private plots and actively participated in collective labor.

(Reported by this newspaper) In agricultural production cooperatives, why is it necessary to adhere to labor discipline? Is there a conflict between adhering to labor discipline and the individual interests of cooperative members? After discussing the issue of collectivization, the agricultural production cooperatives in Huangtugang Township, Fengtai District, Beijing, further debated this question.

Violation of labor discipline was a widespread problem in the commune. Before the great debate, the average attendance rate in the township was only about 80%. More than 30 members of the Yuquan, Caoqiao, and other five production teams of the Caoqiao Production Station had not worked a single day in the commune since the high tide of collectivization in 1956. Most of them went out to "collect fertilizer," and a few planted vegetables and flowers on their private plots, effectively becoming "nominal commune members." The Zhenbei Production Team had 60 laborers, but only eight people showed up for work one day in August when planting cabbage. In labor, phenomena such as being late or leaving early, and loafing on the job were also very serious among commune members. Some commune members also had a poor attitude towards labor, planting cabbage crookedly, being picky and choosy about work, willing to do easy tasks with heavy compensation, but wanting to shirk heavy work with light compensation, working hard on contracted jobs, and not putting in effort on daily-wage jobs.

After understanding the above situation, the township work team, after the debate on whether collectivization was good or not, started with debating the issue of labor discipline, combined with education on the consistency of commune members' individual interests and the collective interests of the cooperative.

When some teams began to debate this issue, some commune members with more "private plots" and who often went out to "collect fertilizer" in the past said behind their backs: "The first rule of labor discipline is that one must not be absent without reason. If this is the case, we cannot engage in 'private plots' or 'collecting fertilizer,' and we will not have any pocket money." In response to this situation, the work team mainly helped them clarify one issue: Is it better to adhere to labor discipline and actively participate in collective labor in the commune to earn more income? Or is it better not to adhere to labor discipline, not work in the commune, and earn more income from "private plots" and "collecting fertilizer"? At the debate, Lai Songhe criticized Zhou Deshan, saying that Zhou Deshan had not worked a single day in the commune from last spring until now, only engaging in his "private plot," and in the end, he only earned a little over a hundred yuan. If he had worked hard in the commune, a laborer like him would not have to worry about receiving four or five hundred yuan. I earned over four hundred yuan by working in the commune. Fan Yian said: "Not only is your own income reduced, but the income of the cooperative is also reduced. Because Zhang San engages in 'private plots,' and Li Si goes out to 'collect fertilizer,' no one does the work of the cooperative, how can good crops grow?" Liu Changhai further concretized this reasoning, saying: In 1956, Caoqiao Village built an electric well. After the electric well was built, the district approved the conversion of 300 mu of dry land near the electric well into paddy fields, and preparations were made to start construction this spring. However, at that time, 30 to 40 laborers from the five production teams of the Caoqiao Production Station related to this matter were absent from work. With insufficient labor, the conversion naturally could not be done. This spring, they had to plant drought-resistant old corn on these 300 mu of land. Now it seems that this 300 mu of old corn can only generate an average income of more than 20 yuan per mu. Our five production teams, about 200 households, each only received a dime. If it were converted into paddy fields, each mu could generate an income of 250 yuan, and 200 households could each receive more than one yuan, a difference of ten times in income. This means: not working hard in the commune harms the cooperative and also harms oneself. After the issue became concrete, everyone's minds cleared up. Many people immediately expressed their intention to withdraw from "private plots," not go out to "collect fertilizer," and work hard in the commune.

In addition, when the Zhenbei Production Team was debating labor discipline, some people had the following thoughts about being on time for work and not being late or leaving early: Anyway, I am not absent, what does it matter if I am a little early or a little late? Planting two more cabbage plants, isn't it all divided among everyone, and I'm afraid I won't even get a cabbage leaf? The team statistician Xue Changgeng said: "If one person is late for one hour a day, ten people are late for ten hours a day. How can you say that this doesn't matter?" Xue Shiqi interjected: When planting cabbage, if we all go to the fields one hour late, in more than 20 days, we will work 20 hours less, which is equivalent to everyone working two days less, which means the cabbage is planted two days later. We farmers all understand this principle: the weather is warm in early autumn, and cabbage grows quickly. The later it gets, the colder it gets, and the slower the cabbage grows. Therefore, planting cabbage two days later means harvesting it half a month later. This half month may not seem important, but who doesn't like to eat "early-season goods"? If other people's vegetables are on the market early and our vegetables are sold late, the price of vegetables will be much different. At least three or four cents per pound is different for half a month. If one mu of land grows 2,000 pounds of vegetables, it will sell for 80 yuan less. A total of more than 50 mu of vegetable fields will sell for 4,000 yuan less. If 4,000 yuan is divided among the 50 households of our team, each household will receive 80 yuan less. Eighty yuan is not a small number. Who can say that it doesn't matter much to me? Everyone then unanimously said: This calculation is correct. Don't be careless in the future. Being careless with the cooperative is being careless with yourself.

Currently, after the commune members of Huangtugang Township Agricultural Production Cooperative clarified the principle that the individual interests of the commune members are consistent with the collective interests of the cooperative, many people no longer engage in "private plots" and "collecting fertilizer." Except for retaining their due share of private plots in accordance with the cooperative's constitution, they have all returned the rest to the cooperative. As of now, 623 households have withdrawn their excess 152 mu of private plots, and many people from the Caoqiao Production Station who went out to "collect fertilizer" have returned. They actively participate in labor in the commune, and the attendance rate in the township has increased from 80% to 93%. Due to the increased labor attendance rate of the commune members, the construction to convert 300 mu of dry land in the Caoqiao Production Station into paddy fields has now begun. The phenomenon of being late or leaving early in the production teams has also undergone significant changes. The Zhenbei Production Team was originally a team known far and wide for "going to the fields late." However, recently, before the bell has even rung, some people have already gone to the fields. During work breaks, they no longer tell stories or play cards, but instead study production issues.

    黄土岗乡辩论劳动纪律问题
    证明个人利益和社的利益完全一致
    经过辩论社员纷纷退回自留地积极参加社里的劳动
    本报讯　在农业生产合作社中，为什么要坚持执行劳动纪律？执行劳动纪律和社员的个人利益有没有矛盾？北京市丰台区黄土岗乡农业生产合作社在讨论了合作化问题以后，进而辩论了这个问题。
    社员违反劳动纪律，是该社普遍存在的一个问题。大辩论前，全乡平均出勤率只有80％左右。草桥生产站的玉泉、草桥等五个生产队有三十多个社员从1956年合作化高潮以来，没有在社里干过一天活，其中多数人出外“抄肥”，少数人在自留地里种菜、栽花，实际上成了“挂名社员”。镇北生产队有六十个劳动力，今年8月份种白菜时，有一天只有八个人出勤。在劳动中，社员中迟到早退、磨洋工的现象也很严重。有些社员的劳动态度也不够好，种白菜东倒西歪，干活挑肥拣瘦，重分轻活的活计愿意做，重活轻分的就想推脱，包工活拚命干，日工活不卖力。
    该乡工作组在了解以上情况后，就在合作化究竟好不好的问题辩论结束以后，从辩论劳动纪律问题入手，结合进行了社员个人利益和合作社集体利益的一致性的教育。
    有些队在开始辩论这个问题时，部分“自留地”较多以及过去经常出外“抄肥”的社员就在背后说：“劳动纪律头一条就是不得无故缺勤，这一来，咱们就不能搞‘自留地’，不能搞‘抄肥’了，也就没个零花钱了”。根据这一情况，工作组主要帮助他们弄清一个问题：究竟还是执行劳动纪律，好好在社里参加集体劳动收入多呢？还是不执行劳动纪律，不在社里劳动，搞“自留地”、“抄肥”收入多呢？在辩论会上，赖松和批评周德山说，周德山从去年春天到现在，没在社里出过一天勤，尽搞他那块“自留地”，到头来才弄了一百来块钱，如果在社里好好出勤，像他那样的劳动力，还愁不分到四百、五百的。我在社里劳动，就分到了四百来元。范以安说：“不光光自己的收入减少了，合作社的收入也减少了。因为张三搞‘自留地’，李四出外‘抄肥’，合作社的活计没人干，怎么能长得出好的庄稼？”刘长海把这个道理进一步具体化了，他说：1956年草桥村兴建了一座电井，电井建成后，已经区里批准将电井附近的三百亩旱地改成水田，并准备今年春天动工，可是当时和这件事有关系的草桥生产站的五个生产队，有三、四十个劳动力不出勤，劳动力不够自然改不了，今年春天不得不在这三百亩地上种上旱地老玉米，现在看起来，这三百亩地老玉米平均每亩只能收入二十多元。咱们五个生产队，大约二百多户，每户才分到一角钱，如果改成水地，一亩地可收入二百五十元，二百多户人家，每家可分到一块多钱，收入整整相差十倍。这就是说：不好好在社里出勤，害了合作社，也害了自己。问题一具体化以后，大家的脑子就通了，当场许多人表示要退出“自留地”，不出去“抄肥”了，要好好在社里劳动。
    另外，镇北生产队在辩论劳动纪律时，曾有人对按时上工、不迟到早退存在这样的思想：反正我不缺勤，早一会迟一会算什么呢？多种两棵白菜还不是你分我分大家分，我怕连根菜叶子也分不到呢？队统计员薛长庚说：“一人一天迟到一小时，十人一天就迟到十小时，这怎能说不算一回事呢？”薛士其接口说：种白菜时，咱们大伙儿晚下地一个钟头，二十多天中，就少干了二十个钟头，也就等于大伙儿少干了两天，也就是白菜种晚了两天。咱们庄稼人都懂得这个道理：初秋天气暖，白菜长起来快，越向后越冷，白菜长起来就慢，所以迟种两天菜，就要迟收半个月。这半个月看起来不大要紧，可就是谁不喜欢吃个“上市货”？人家的菜早上市了，我们的菜卖晚了，菜价就相差好多，半个月至少得差三、四分钱一斤，一亩地就算长两千斤菜，还少卖八十元呢？一共五十多亩菜地，就少卖四千元，四千元分到咱们队的五十户社员身上，每户人家就少分八十元，八十元是一个不小的数字，谁能说轮到我身上没有多少呢？大伙儿这才一致说：这个账算得对。以后可别马虎了，对合作社马虎了，也就是对自己马虎。
    目前，黄土岗乡农业生产合作社社员在明确了社员个人利益和合作社的集体利益是一致的道理后，许多人已不再搞“自留地”和“抄肥”了，他们除按照合作社章程留下应有的一份自留地外，其余全部退给合作社，至目前止，已有六百二十三户退出多余的一百五十二亩自留地，草桥生产站许多出外“抄肥”的人都回来了。他们积极参加社里劳动，全乡出勤率由80％提高到93％，由于社员劳动出勤率提高，草桥生产站的三百亩旱地现已动工改水地。各生产队迟到早退现象也有显著转变，镇北生产队原来是远近闻名的“下地晚”的一个队，可是，近来钟声还没有响，有些人就已下地了。在工间休息时，也不再说书、打扑克，而是研究生产上的问题了。
