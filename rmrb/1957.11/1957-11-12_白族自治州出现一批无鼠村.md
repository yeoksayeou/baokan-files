A Batch of Rat-Free Villages Appears in the Bai Autonomous Prefecture

    (Our dispatch) The Dali Bai Autonomous Prefecture in Yunnan Province has eradicated plague and has seen the emergence of ten rat-free villages. Currently, the prefecture is conducting rat catching and extermination work in twenty villages in Xiangyun, Dali, Xiaguan, Jianchuan and other counties (cities). By the end of the year, most of the villages will have basically eliminated rats and become rat-free villages.

    These rat-free villages, besides the pilot villages, have emerged during the patriotic health campaign after the "National Agricultural Development Outline (Draft)" proposed the requirement to basically eliminate rats within twelve years in 1956.

    The Dali Bai Autonomous Prefecture is the earliest and most severely affected area of plague in Yunnan Province. According to the Yunnan Gazetteer: as early as 1787 (i.e., the fifty-second year of the Qianlong reign of the Qing Dynasty), in Dengchuan "along with the Jiaqing plague, tens of thousands died, the wilderness was uninhabited, and the people called it 'itch disease'." Since then, throughout the Daoguang, Xianfeng, Tongzhi, and Guangxu reigns until before liberation for more than one hundred and sixty years, the plague has occurred intermittently. In 1947, one hundred and twenty-nine people died. After liberation, under the care of the Party and the People's Government, prevention and treatment stations were established in Xiangyun and other places, and grassroots epidemic prevention personnel and village health personnel were trained. By 1954, human plague had been basically eliminated. After 1955, the occurrence of the disease has stopped. (Nan)

### 白族自治州出现一批无鼠村

    白族自治州出现一批无鼠村
    本报讯　云南省大理白族自治州已经消灭了鼠疫，并出现了十个无鼠村。目前该州正在祥云、大理、下关、剑川等县（市）的二十个村子中进行捕鼠灭鼠工作，年底将有大部分村基本上消灭老鼠，变成无鼠村。
    这些无鼠村，除试点村以外，都是在1956年全国农业发展纲要（草案）提出在十二年内基本上消灭老鼠的要求后，在爱国卫生运动中出现的。
    大理白族自治州是云南鼠疫病流行最早和最严重的地区。据云南通志记载：早在1787年（即清乾隆五十二年），邓川“沿及嘉庆大疫，死者数以万计，野无人烟，众谓‘痒子病’”，自此以后，道光、咸丰、同治、光绪直到解放前的一百六十多年中，鼠疫始终或断或续，1947年就死亡一百二十九人。解放后在党和人民政府的关怀下，在祥云等地建立了防治站，训练了基层防疫人员和乡村卫生人员，到1954年人间鼠疫即已基本消灭。1955年以后发病已经停止。　（南）
