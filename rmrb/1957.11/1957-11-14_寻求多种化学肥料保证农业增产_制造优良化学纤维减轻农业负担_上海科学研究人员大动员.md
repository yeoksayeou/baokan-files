Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, November 13th. As the country begins to vigorously develop chemical fertilizers and chemical fibers, Shanghai, as one of China's chemical industry bases, is currently a hive of activity in its laboratories. Here, people can see the bright prospects for food and clothing.

Several hundred researchers in Shanghai are conducting fifty or sixty special research projects related to chemical fibers and chemical fertilizers. "Nylon-11" and "Nylon-66," which can be made into clothing and socks as light and thin as paper, are being trial-produced in plastic laboratories. If it is interwoven with other natural fibers, it can also be made into a variety of brightly colored clothing. This kind of clothing is as soft and thick as wool, warm, durable, and easy to wash. In the experimental workshop of the Anle Rayon Factory, technicians have already learned all the technologies for producing rayon. Wonderful machines are spinning pure white, sparkling rayon like silkworms. The factory is now under construction and is expected to be officially put into production next year, with a daily output of 1.5 tons.

Chemical fertilizer is the focus of research at the Shanghai Chemical Industry Research Institute of the Ministry of Chemical Industry this year. Researchers are conducting fifty-three special research projects on chemical fertilizers suitable for various soils and crops. These include nitrogen fertilizers, phosphate fertilizers, potash fertilizers, and high-concentration mixed fertilizers. After these fertilizers are used in farmland, it has been proven that for every kilogram of chemical fertilizer applied, the yield per unit area of cotton and grain can be increased by 0.5 to more than 5 kilograms. Researchers have also worked with technicians from the Shanghai Iron and Steel Company to discover that steel slag, a waste product discharged from steelmaking furnaces, can be ground into powder and applied to farmland with the same effect as phosphate fertilizer. If the steel slag from Shanghai's steel mills is used as fertilizer, it is estimated that it can increase grain production by 100 million kilograms a year. Many of the raw materials for the chemical fibers and chemical fertilizers trial-produced in Shanghai are made from agricultural waste products; some are extracted from petroleum waste gas and coal. The Anle Rayon Factory has already used wood and cotton scraps to make pulp, which is then subjected to complex chemical treatment to obtain fibers. "Nylon-66" and "Nylon-11" are made from corncobs, cotton stalks, cottonseed hulls, rice husks, and castor oil. Researchers are also using domestically produced gypsum or by-products from phosphate fertilizer production to replace sulfuric acid in the manufacture of nitrogen fertilizers, which provides convenience for Shanghai to produce inexpensive and high-quality chemical fibers and chemical fertilizers in batches.

In addition to organizing a group of technicians to visit and study in Beijing, Nanjing, and other places to prepare for the factory design of chemical fiber plants and chemical fertilizer plants, the relevant industrial departments in Shanghai have also decided to build factories using petroleum waste gas and coal gas plants in Longhua, Gaoqiao, and other suburbs to provide the main raw materials for the batch production of chemical fibers and chemical fertilizers.

### 寻求多种化学肥料保证农业增产  制造优良化学纤维减轻农业负担  上海科学研究人员大动员

    寻求多种化学肥料保证农业增产
    制造优良化学纤维减轻农业负担
    上海科学研究人员大动员
    新华社上海13日电　当国家开始大力发展化学肥料和化学纤维的时候，作为我国化学工业基地之一的上海，目前在实验室里呈现着一片繁忙的景象。这里，人们可以看到吃饭穿衣的美好前景。
    上海的几百名研究人员正在进行有关化学纤维和化学肥料的五、六十项专题研究。可以做成像纸般轻薄衣袜的“尼龙一一”和“尼龙六六”，正在塑料实验室里试制；如果拿它同其它天然纤维交织，还可以制成多种色泽鲜艳的服装，这种服装有呢绒般的软厚、温暖，而且经久耐穿，洗涤简便。在安乐人造丝厂的实验车间里，技术人员已经学会了生产人造丝的全部技术，奇妙的机器正像蚕一样地吐出洁白的、闪闪发光的人造丝。现在这个厂正在进行基本建设，预计明年正式投入生产以后，日产量能达到一吨半。
    化学肥料是化学工业部上海化学工业研究院今年研究的重点。研究人员正在进行适用于各种土壤和作物的五十三项有关化学肥料的专题研究。其中有氮肥、磷肥、钾肥和高浓度的混合肥料等化学肥料。这些肥料分别在农田使用以后，证明每施用一斤化学肥料，棉粮的单位面积产量可以提高半斤到五斤以上。研究人员还跟上海钢铁公司的技术人员共同发现炼钢炉里倒出的废物——钢渣磨成粉末施用在农田上，效用同磷肥相仿。如果把上海的炼钢厂的钢渣用来当肥料，估计一年可以增产一亿斤粮食。上海试制的化学纤维和化学肥料的原料，有许多是利用农产废品；还有一些是从石油废气和煤炭中提取的。安乐人造丝厂已经利用木料和棉花下脚等做成浆粕，经过复杂的化学处理以后，取得纤维。“尼龙六六”和“尼龙一一”是分别用苞米芯子、棉花梗、棉籽壳、砻糠和蓖麻油等来做原料的。研究人员还利用国内盛产的石膏或生产磷肥的下脚，来代替硫酸，制造氮肥，这都给上海成批生产价廉物美的化学纤维和化学肥料提供了便利条件。
    上海的有关工业部门除了组织一批技术人员到北京、南京等地参观学习，准备进行化学纤维厂和化学肥料厂的厂房设计以外，并且决定在市郊的龙华、高桥等地兴建利用石油废气的工厂、煤气厂等工厂，为成批生产化学纤维和化学肥料提供主要原料。
