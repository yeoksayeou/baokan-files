    The Story of Two Mothers
    Xinhua News Agency Reporter Xu Fang

    A Chinese Mother
    Little Lena, the daughter of a Soviet expert, is fair and plump, and almost four months old. Mentioning her name brings to mind the deep Sino-Soviet friendship that is integrated into her little life.

    Lena was born on July 1st of this year at the Anshan Iron and Steel Works (Angang) Employee Hospital. Because Lena's birth was difficult, her mother had no milk. But the child urgently needed breast milk for nutrition. Lena's mother cried in distress when she couldn't get milk and started crying. Seeing this situation, Xiang Huiying, the midwife at the employee hospital, volunteered to share some of her milk to feed the child, because she had given birth to a boy two months earlier, and her milk was plentiful and of good quality. From then on, Lena grew plumper day by day under Xiang Huiying's care. After Lena was discharged from the hospital, Xiang Huiying squeezed the milk into a bottle and sent it to her twice a day.

    Lena's father, expert Borisov, had been hoping for a daughter for ten years. Borisova, who is thirty-eight years old this year, is particularly fond of this little daughter. More than two months later, little Lena had grown very strong. Her father and mother took her to the employee hospital to visit Xiang Huiying. When Borisova met Xiang Huiying, the two hugged. Borisova held Xiang Huiying's hand and said, "Thank you, Chinese mother." Xiang Huiying smiled and said, "This is nothing compared to the Soviet experts helping to build Angang!" Borisov and his wife also gave Xiang Huiying a photo of Lena and a beautiful bedsheet as souvenirs, and said to Xiang Huiying, "When we see Lena, we think of you, and when you see these souvenirs, you will think of Lena."

      A Soviet Mother
    The reporter recently also interviewed engineer Yang Fangtai, who returned from the Soviet Union more than three months ago. He deeply misses a Soviet old lady. He and his classmates received the help of Soviet old lady Dora Mikhailovna in all the big and small difficulties during their six years of life and study in the Soviet Union. Her care was no different from a mother's, so they all called her "Soviet Mother."

    Dora Mikhailovna is the deputy director of the teaching affairs office of the Moscow Institute of Steel and Alloys. She is nearly sixty years old. Her only son heroically sacrificed himself in the Soviet Patriotic War. She has no children, and she regards the Chinese youth as her own sons.

    Six years ago, when this group of Chinese students first arrived in the Soviet Union, they couldn't communicate in the language. Some of them had just started learning Russian. At this time, the old lady tried to arrange for teachers to tutor them. Originally, some courses in the Soviet Union had one tutor for more than twenty students, but the Chinese students had one tutor for just a few people. Dora Mikhailovna helped the Chinese students arrange places for internships and visits. They visited or interned in almost all the famous iron and steel enterprises in the Soviet Union. Whenever these Chinese students set off for internships in other places, the old lady always thought of everything for them thoughtfully. One winter, they were going to the Urals. The old lady asked the school to prepare a pair of high-top felt boots for each of them, and insisted that they take them. She said, if you don't have them there, your feet will freeze. A student named Wang often caught colds. Once, the old lady brought a packet of mustard plasters to see this student. She said that applying the mustard plasters to the back would help him recover. This was a Soviet folk remedy. She even personally applied the mustard plasters to the student. It was really effective, and his cold got better.

    Before Yang Fangtai returned to China, Mikhailovna specially asked the school to give him a rolling mill material. This material was compiled by famous Soviet rolling mill expert Pavlov over many years, and it collected various theories on rolling mill business from all over the world. The information also records the world's rolling mill situation in 1859. This book is of great value for the study of rolling mill theory.

    Not long after returning to China, Yang Fangtai sent Mikhailovna a wedding photo. The bride, Miao Xiuxin, also sent her "Three Goods Student" commemorative badge and photo to Mikhailovna. The old lady was extremely happy and gave her the name of a beautiful Russian girl, Sima. In her reply, she said: "I am really happy to have such a big family in China, because there are so many good sons and daughters who are building their great motherland, and they all love their people."

    两个妈妈的故事
    新华社记者　徐放
    中国妈妈
    一个苏联专家的女孩小列娜长得又白又胖，已经快四个月了，提起她的名字，就使人想起在她小小的生命里，溶和着深厚的中苏友情。
    列娜是今年7月1日出生在鞍钢职工医院的，因为列娜生时是难产，她的妈妈一点奶水也没有，可是小孩子却急需要用人奶来营养。列娜的妈妈望着她吃不到奶哭叫起来时，就心痛的哭了。这时职工医院的助产士相惠英见到这种情况，她自动提出愿意分一部分奶来喂养这个孩子，因为她在两个月前生了一个男孩子，奶水又多又好。从此，列娜就在相惠英的哺育下，一天比一天胖起来了。后来列娜出院了，相惠英就把奶挤在瓶里，每天送给她吃两次。
    列娜的爸爸巴利索夫专家盼望有一个女孩已经盼望了十年。巴利索娃今年已经三十八岁了，对于这个小女儿就特别喜爱。两个多月后，小列娜已经长得很结实了，她的爸爸和妈妈抱了她到职工医院去拜访相惠英。巴利索娃见了相惠英，两人拥抱起来了，巴利索娃握着相惠英的手说：“谢谢中国妈妈”。相惠英笑着说：“这算不了什么，比起苏联专家帮助建设鞍钢真差的远哩！”巴利索夫和他的爱人还把列娜的照片和一床美丽的床单送给相惠英作为纪念品，并对相惠英说，“我们看到列娜就想起你，你看到这些纪念品也会想起列娜。”
      苏联妈妈
    记者最近还访问了刚从苏联回国三个多月的杨方泰工程师。他非常怀念一位苏联老太太。他和他的同学在苏联六年的生活和学习中，大小困难都得到了苏联老太太多拉·米哈依罗夫娜的帮助。她的关怀和母亲没有两样，所以他们都称呼她“苏联妈妈”。
    多拉·米哈依罗夫娜是莫斯科钢铁学院的副教务主任。她已年近六十岁了。她唯一的儿子在苏联卫国战争中英勇牺牲了。她没有孩子，她把中国的青年人，看作自己的儿子。
    六年前，这批中国学生初到苏联，言语不通，他们中间有些人是刚刚开始学习俄文。这时，这位老太太就想办法请教员给他们补习，本来有些课程苏联学生要二十多人才有一位导师，中国学生呢，几个人就请一位。多拉·米哈依罗夫娜帮助中国学生安排实习参观的地方，苏联的几个著名钢铁企业，他们几乎全部都去参观或实习过了。每当这些中国学生出发去外地实习时，老太太总为他们想得很周到。有一个冬天他们要到乌拉尔去，老太太就叫学校为他们每人准备一双高统毡毛靴，一定要他们带去，她说，那里没有它，你们的脚就要冻坏的。有一个姓王的学生常常感冒，有一次老太太带了一包芥茉药纸来看这个学生，她说把芥茉药纸敷在背脊上就能好起来，这是苏联民间的一个土方子，她还亲自动手把芥茉药纸给这个学生敷上，真是灵验，他的感冒就好了。
    在杨方泰回国之前，米哈依罗夫娜特意叫学校送给他一部轧钢资料，这部资料是在苏联有名的轧钢专家巴甫洛夫领导下，多年来编著成功的，它搜集了世界各国在轧钢事业上的各种理论，资料中还记载有1859年时世界上轧钢的情况。这部书对于研究轧钢理论是有着非常重大的价值的。
    回国不久，杨方泰寄给米哈依罗夫娜一张新婚照片，新娘子缪秀馨还把在学校里的三好纪念章和照片送给了米哈依罗夫娜。这位老太太高兴极了，赠给她一个美丽的俄罗斯女孩的名字叫茜玛。她的回信中说：“我真高兴在中国有这样一个大家庭，因为有这样多的好儿女正在建设着自己伟大的祖国，并且他（她）们都是热爱着自己的人民。”（附图片）
