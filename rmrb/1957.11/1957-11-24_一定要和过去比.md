Must Compare with the Past
    Dong Jin
    Recently I read a letter, and a passage in it said:
    “After the rectification movement was launched in the Beijing No. 1 State-Owned Cotton Factory, a total of 2,628 opinions were put forward regarding living and welfare matters. These opinions accounted for the largest proportion of all types of opinions. Most of those who raised these opinions were new workers. They put up big-character posters saying that the factory had no welfare benefits and only wanted money. They felt that public housing rent, water and electricity, furniture, heating, nurseries, and barber services should not be charged. Old workers were extremely dissatisfied with these fallacies. Li Lanzhen, the deputy foreman of the fine yarn Class A, who had been a worker for more than 20 years in the old society, said excitedly, 'In the old society, female workers were fired when they became pregnant, and they had to go to work without rest after giving birth. Now pregnant women have maternity leave, there are nurseries, and there are also nutrition canteens. There are welfare benefits everywhere. You still say there are no welfare benefits; you really have no conscience!' The new workers in the workshop immediately retorted, 'Now is the new society, the past was the old society. Who told you to be born in the old society? You deserve it!' Some said, 'Today's new society can only be compared with the Soviet Union, not with the past.' They argued back and forth, and Li Lanzhen was so angry that she trembled. This is how the gap between the old workers and the new workers was formed.”
    What was the situation between the old workers and the new workers? According to the same letter:
    “The No. 1 State-Owned Cotton Factory started production successively in 1953 and 1954. In this factory, in addition to the 300 to 400 old workers supported by the textile factories in Shanghai, Qingdao, Tianjin, etc., the other 75% to 80% were high school graduates and junior high school students recruited from the countryside and cities at that time. After more than half a year of internship, most of these people were promoted to become the factory's main technical workers—loom operators and deputy foremen. Their wages were as much as those of old workers who had been working for more than ten or twenty years. Therefore, they began to develop tendencies toward arrogance, complacency, corruption, and degeneration; at the same time, some of them did not abide by labor discipline and did not study technology. When the old workers made suggestions, they said, 'You have been working for more than ten years and you are only so-so.'”
    This must be said to be a dangerous tendency among some of the young workers in the workshop. There is obviously an ideological difference in this, and therefore it is particularly worthy of attention by the factory leaders and trade union education workers.
    I remember that during the Liberation War, while we were carrying out land reform in the countryside, we were also conducting a “speaking bitterness” movement among the soldiers in the army, one of which was to carry out education through comparisons between the new and the old, thereby raising the class consciousness of the peasants and soldiers, so as to determine "for whom to be a soldier" and "for whom to fight."
    Today, the revolution has succeeded, and a new society has been established. That is to say, the issue of revolutionary power has been resolved, but the tasks of ideological revolution and political revolution are still very arduous. And this kind of political revolution and ideological revolution is not only important among intellectuals, but also very important among workers and peasants. The examples mentioned above of some of the new workers in the No. 1 State-Owned Cotton Factory illustrate that there are also ideological problems among the new workers, and if these problems are not resolved, they will also have an adverse impact on the working class's leadership in building socialism.
    Therefore, I think it is very necessary to carry out an education and debate comparing the new and the old in the factory during the process of great airing of views, great contending, great debate, and great improvement. I think it is wrong to think that we cannot compare with the past, that is, we cannot compare with the old society.
    Just take the fact that the No. 1 State-Owned Cotton Factory recruited 80% of its workers from junior high school and high school graduates, and within less than a year of internship, most of them were promoted to become the factory's main technical workers—loom operators and deputy foremen, and their wages were as much as those of old workers who had been working for more than ten or twenty years. This is completely different from the old society. In the old society, not to mention elementary school students and junior high school students, even university students were unemployed upon graduation, and even foreign students returning to China would have to starve if they had no connections. This not only reflects the fundamental difference between the new and old social systems, but also reflects the great achievements of socialist construction.
    But can this become the capital for these new workers in the workshop to be proud, become the basis for a few of them to degenerate and become corrupt, and become the basis for them to ask the Party and the state for this and that, and even demand the abolition of reasonable charges for rent, water and electricity, furniture, heating, nurseries, and barber services, etc.? I don’t think so.
    Not to mention the situation of these new workers at home and the past of their parents, just talk about what the situation was when they were elementary school students and junior high school students before they became workers, and what the situation is now that they have become workers. We have visited the No. 1 State-Owned Cotton Factory, and not to mention the cleanliness of the factory buildings and the circulation of air, the dormitories are obviously not as dirty, crowded, and prone to epidemics and infectious diseases as the workers' dormitories we used to see in Zhabei and Caojiadu in Shanghai. At that time, it was difficult to talk about modern facilities such as heating and nurseries. But what about the dormitories of the current No. 1 State-Owned Cotton Factory? Located in the eastern suburbs of Beijing, wide asphalt roads pass in front of it, beautiful buses pass by frequently, and there are single dormitories and family dormitories in the dormitories, which are generally better than those of ordinary citizens, especially in terms of sanitary facilities, which many citizens do not enjoy. I would like to ask, could you have such a working environment and such living conditions when you were an elementary school student or a junior high school student? Could you have imagined it? What's more, there are wages, and after only more than half a year of internship, they are as high as the wages of old workers who have been working for more than ten or twenty years. In this case, saying that there are no welfare benefits is not just a matter of not being content, but also a bit ungrateful and unworthy of the title of master of the working class.
    Therefore, it is entirely right for old workers like Li Lanzhen to disapprove of this phenomenon, be extremely dissatisfied with this phenomenon, rise up to criticize it, and even tremble with anger. We need old workers like Li Lanzhen, not just one, but tens of thousands, and we want all workers to be like her. In this way, the unity of the working class will be more consolidated, and the cause of socialist construction will be more rapid.
    Can we compare with the Soviet Union? The answer is yes and we should, but not by first comparing the enjoyment of benefits (besides, the Soviet Union is still vigorously saving and advocating thrift), but by comparing increasing production, comparing inventions and creations, comparing their scientific and cultural level, comparing their political and ideological awareness, and comparing their ability to launch artificial satellites. Similarly, this kind of comparison should also be made with old workers. Don't compare technology first, but compare Li Lanzhen's attitude (that is, her position) and her way of dealing with problems. It is precisely because she can look at the new society and the new workers from her personal experience in the old society that she can say: "There are welfare benefits everywhere. You still say there are no welfare benefits; you really have no conscience!" Therefore, she loves the Party, the new society, and her factory a hundred times more. People who have not had this kind of experience feel, and put up big-character posters saying: "The factory has no welfare benefits and only wants money." This is a struggle between two roads in the working class. The former regards the factory as its own, so it protects the factory from a political and ideological perspective, and from the perspective of improving the class consciousness of the workers. The latter does not regard the factory as its own, and since it does not regard it as its own, it can demand endlessly, just like treating a capitalist's factory. Obviously, the latter is wrong.
    Besides, since you have taken your wages, you should pay for water and electricity, pay for heating, pay for nurseries, and pay for barber services accordingly. Who has ever seen barbering without paying? Even in the future communist society, we must first "each according to his ability" and then "each according to his needs"!
    Perhaps some people will ask: Why are these new workers like this? I think, one is that they have not suffered like the old workers, they do not know how the current work and life came about, and their money really comes too easily; the second is that they also brought some petty-bourgeois dirty things, including nihilism and absolute egalitarianism; the third is that they have not yet established a true working-class outlook on life. Don't think that just because you are a worker and have a trade union membership card means that you are a real proletarian. If you are not careful, you will also produce and become like those who treat workers like Li Lanzhen, scolding her: "Who told you to be born in the old society? You deserve it!" This is especially worthy of attention.
    So I finally say: To compare, you must compare with the past. Otherwise, you will not see your own achievements and progress, and there will be no good or bad; otherwise, even if you take over the technology from the old workers, you will not be able to take over the political, ideological, and work style from the old workers.
    If readers don't mind, I will also copy two rural folk songs below, which also show that in our country, all aspects must be compared, and we must compare with the past.
    The first: Mountain folks, really miserable, the stove is their cotton jacket, pine resin is their lamp, and they eat wild vegetables all their lives.
    The second: Running the cooperative is good, running the cooperative is good, wearing a new cotton jacket, a hundred kinds of grass on the mountain, everything turns into treasure.

    一定要和过去比
    冬今
    最近我看了一则通信，通信中一段是这样说的：
    “工厂整风运动开展以后，北京国棉一厂共提出了二千六百二十八条关于生活福利方面的意见。这些意见占各类意见的比重最大。提意见的大部分是新工人。他们贴大字报说，工厂什么福利也没有，只会要钱。他们觉得公家的房租、水电、家具、暖气、托儿所和理发等都不应该收费。老工人对这些谬论极不满意。曾在旧社会当过二十多年工人的细纱甲班副工长李兰珍激动地说，旧社会女工怀孕就被解雇，生下孩子不敢休息就上班，现在孕妇有产假，有托儿所、还有营养食堂，到处都是福利，你们还说没福利，真没良心！车间新工人听了马上反驳说：现在是新社会，过去是旧社会，谁叫你生在旧社会，活该！有的说，今天新社会只能和苏联比，不能和过去比。你一句他一言，把李兰珍气得发抖。老工人和新工人之间的隔阂就是这样形成的”。
    老工人和新工人是怎么一个状况呢？据同篇通信说：
    “国棉一厂在1953年和1954年相继开工生产。这个厂的工人除上海、青岛、天津等纺织厂分别支援三、四百名老工人外，其他75％到80％都是当时从农村、城市招收来的高小毕业生和初中生。这些人经过半年多的实习，便大部分升为工厂的主要技术工人——挡车工和副工长，她们的工资和已经工作十多年和二十多年的老工人一样多。因此她们开始滋长了骄傲自大和腐化堕落倾向；同时有一部分人不遵守劳动纪律，不研究技术，老工人提意见，她们说，你们干十几年也不过如此。”
    这不能不说是车间中一部分年青工人中的危险倾向。这中间显然是有一个思想分歧的，因此，特别值得工厂的领导和工会教育工作者的注意。
    我曾记得在解放战争期间，我们一面在农村中搞土地改革，一面在部队战士中搞诉苦运动，其中有一条就是进行新旧对比的教育，借此来提高农民和士兵的阶级觉悟，从而确定“为谁当兵”，“为谁打仗”。
    今天革命成功了，新社会建立了，就是说革命的政权问题解决了，但是思想革命、政治革命的任务还非常艰巨，而这种政治革命、思想革命不仅在知识分子中重要，就是在工人、农民中也是十分重要的。前面所提到的国棉一厂新工人中间的一些例子，正说明在新工人中也存在着思想问题，而这些问题不解决，也会对工人阶级领导建设社会主义的事业产生不利的影响。
    因此，我以为在工厂进行大放、大鸣、大争、大改中来进行一次新旧对比的教育和辩论是很有必要的。认为不能同过去比，也就是说不能同旧社会比，我以为是错误的。
    单就国棉一厂从初中生、高小毕业生中招考80％的工人，并在不到一年的实习中，便大部分升为工厂的主要技术工人——挡车工和副工长，工资和已经工作十多年和二十多年的老工人一样多这一点来说，就和旧社会迥然不同。旧社会莫说小学生、初中生，就是大学生，毕业即是失业，甚至外国留学生回国，无门路也同样得饿饭。这不仅反映出新旧社会制度的根本不同，也反映了社会主义建设的巨大成就。
    然而是不是这就可以成为这些车间中的新工人骄傲的资本，成为他们中少数人可以去堕落腐化的根据，成为他们向党、向国家要这要那，进而要求取消房租、水电、家具、暖气、托儿所和理发等等的正当收费的根据呢？我认为不可以。
    且不说这些新工人在家里的情况和他们父母亲的过去，只说他们没有当工人之前，还当小学生、初中生的时候是一个什么状况，现在当了工人又是一个什么状况。我们参观过国棉一厂，且不说厂房之整洁，空气之流通，宿舍也显然不是过去在上海闸北、曹家渡一带所看到的工人宿舍那样脏，那样拥挤，那样经常发生流行病、传染病。当时很难谈得到什么暖气、托儿所等这些现代设备。可是现在的国棉一厂的宿舍呢？地处北京东郊，宽敞的柏油马路通过它的面前，漂亮的公共汽车经常通过，宿舍中有单人宿舍、家庭宿舍，一般都比市民好，特别是卫生设备上，是许多市民都没有享受到的。试问这种工作环境，这种生活待遇，当小学生，当中学生的时代能有吗？能想得到吗？更何况还有工资，而且只经过半年多的实习就和十多年、二十多年的老工人的工资一样多。在这种情况下还说没有福利，不只是知足不知足的问题，也是有点忘本，有愧于工人阶级主人翁的称号。
    因此，像李兰珍这样老工人看不惯这种现象，极不满意这种现象，起而进行批评，以至气得发抖是完全应该的。我们需要李兰珍这样的老工人，不只一个，要成千上万，要所有的工人都能像她一样。这样工人阶级的团结就会更加巩固，社会主义的建设事业就会更加迅速。
    可不可以跟苏联比？答复是可以而且应该，但不是先去比享受待遇（何况苏联现在还在大力节约，提倡勤俭），而是要去比增加生产，比发明创造，比他们科学文化水平，比他们的政治、思想的觉悟，比他们能够放出人造卫星。同样的，这种比还应该去和老工人比，先不去比技术，先去比李兰珍这种看问题的态度（也就是立场）和她对待问题的办法。正因为她能够从旧社会的切身遭遇来看新社会，新工人，所以她能够说出：“到处都是福利，你们还说没福利，真没良心！”因而她就百倍的爱党，爱新社会，爱她的工厂。没有这种遭遇的人，就觉得，并且贴大字报说：“工厂什么福利也没有，只会收钱”。这是工人中两条道路的斗争，前者是把工厂当为自己的，所以要从政治、思想上，从提高工人的阶级觉悟上来保护工厂，后者是不把工厂当自己的，既然不当自己的，就可以要求无穷，像对待资本家的工厂一样。显然后者是错误的。
    再说，你既拿了工资，就应该相应的付水电、付暖气、付托儿所、付理发费。那见过理发不付钱的？就是在将来的共产主义社会也要先“各尽所能”，然后才“各取所需”呀！
    也许有人要问：这部分新工人何以如此呢？我想，一是他们没有像老工人那样受过苦，他们不知道现在的工作和生活是如何来的，他们的钱实在来得太容易了；二是他们也还带来了一些小资产阶级的脏东西，其中就有虚无主义和绝对平均主义；三是他们还没有树立起真正的工人阶级的人生观。不要以为是工人，有了工会证就是真正的无产阶级了，不小心，也会产生并会成为像对待李兰珍那样的工人，骂她：“谁叫你生在旧社会，活该！”这是特别值得注意的。
    所以我最后说：要比，一定要和过去比。不然，看不到自己的成就和进步，就没有个好坏；不然，就是技术上从老工人那里接了班，政治、思想、作风上从老工人那里是接不了班的。
    如果读者不嫌烦，我还抄两段农村歌谣在下面，也说明在我们国家，各方面都是要比，一定要和过去比。
    其一：山里佬，真苦恼，火炉当棉袄，松明当灯照，苦菜吃到老。
    其二：办社好，办社好，穿上新棉袄，山上百样草，样样变成宝。
