Welcome Writers to the Worker-Peasant-Soldier Masses!

Editor's Note: On November 12th, this newspaper published an editorial, "We Must Have a Strong Contingent of Working-Class Literature and Art," and a report on the decision of many writers in the capital to go to factories, rural areas, and army companies. Since then, many readers across the country have written letters, firmly supporting the Party's call—for literary and art workers to integrate with the worker-peasant-soldier masses for a long time—and expressing warm welcome to the actions and determination of many writers in the capital to go to the worker-peasant-soldier masses. What is published here is only a portion of the readers' letters.

	We Welcome Writers to Our Place with Open Arms

							Liu Yinqin

	After reading the People's Daily editorial on November 12th, "We Must Have a Strong Contingent of Working-Class Literature and Art," and the news of writers going to factories and rural areas, I simply don't know what words to use to describe my excitement. I feel as if I am standing in front of the writers, shaking hands with them warmly, and the words "Welcome, welcome, welcome you all" keep湧出 (surging) from my heart.

	I am a linesman. In real life, I deeply feel that there are many moving deeds worthy of praise, but I have never seen a novel describing linesmen. Is it that we linesmen work hard year after year, in snow and rain, regardless of severe cold and scorching sun, overcoming and conquering many difficulties, and that countless moving deeds are not worth writing about by writers? I don't think so. It's that the writers haven't come to our place. Serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers is the Party's literary and artistic policy. It stands to reason that there should be more good works reflecting the lives of workers, but the reality is not entirely satisfactory. I think the problem lies in the fact that writers have not taken root among the workers. Now that many writers have gone deep into the worker-peasant masses, I believe that in the near future a large number of good works describing workers and peasants will appear. I am a literary enthusiast, and many heroic worker images are constantly active in my mind, but because of my limited education, I cannot write them out. I hope writers will come to our place and write about us.

	Raise your hands high, welcome, welcome!

	Welcome You to the Grassroots
		Yichang City Candy Store Li Wei

	I am a demobilized soldier who worked in literary and art work in the army for a period of time, and I also like to read literary works in my spare time. Although writers have created a large number of excellent works in the years since liberation, they still cannot keep up with the demands of the people. Just to give one example, I have rarely seen writers write about our demobilized soldiers participating in peaceful construction in factories, mines, rural areas, and enterprises. Even if they wrote a little, it was too little. In recent years, hundreds of thousands of our demobilized soldiers have responded to the Party's call to participate in the country's economic construction, and many outstanding people have emerged in different positions. Many comrades have maintained the glorious tradition of revolutionary soldiers. They were heroes in killing the enemy at the front, and they are models on the production front in the rear. For example, in 1953, seven demobilized soldiers in Yichang City, with the support of the Party and government, took out their production assistance funds to open a flour mill. At the beginning, no one took a salary, only food, and then slowly took a few yuan a month. They overcame many difficulties in their work. The flour mill went from nothing to something, from small to large, and has now developed into a local state-owned enterprise. Now most of the employees in the factory are demobilized soldiers. They are always the first to actively respond to any call from the Party. These heroic deeds are countless. Let the writers sing their praises and let people learn from their spirit of not fearing difficulties and forging ahead!

	So this time, the writers are going deep into the grassroots for a long time, which is indeed a great joy. I welcome you.

	Writers, Welcome You!
						Soldier Zhou Pengnian

	At dawn on November 12th, I heard on the news program of the Central People's Broadcasting Station that writers are going to factories, rural areas, and troops, to share weal and woe with the working people, participate in physical labor, and live with the soldiers in the companies. This news really made me happy. I thought of Wei Wei's "Who Are the Most Lovable People" and Lu Zhuguo's "Shangganling" and other works. How admirable are those heroes in the works!

	In real life, I have personally seen generals cooking for soldiers (of course, on holidays), and seen the heroic qualities of platoon leaders and company commanders with scars and old soldiers who have gone through the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea in peaceful construction and military training.

	I have picked up my pen many times to write down their moving deeds, but my educational level is low, I can't write them out, and I can't achieve my hope. Now that I hear that you—engineers of the human soul—are going to the companies, rural areas, and factories to participate in labor, live with the worker-peasant-soldier masses for a long time, and create, how happy I am!

	Go to the Areas Inhabited by Minority Nationalities
		Zhuang Student of the Central University for Nationalities Su Damin

	I am a Zhuang youth. For many years, I have absorbed much spiritual nourishment from the excellent works of my respected writers, enriched my knowledge, and increased my strength. Some writers have also gone deep into our minority areas, writing excellent works that reflect the lives and struggles of our various ethnic groups. Now there are still many writers living in minority areas and are creating in this area. This makes me very happy. When we see films about minority nationalities in the auditorium of the University for Nationalities, our students of all ethnic groups give the warmest and longest applause. How much we hope that writers will go deep into our minority areas and write more poems reflecting the lives and struggles of our minority nationalities!

	Our Zhuang people are the most populous minority in the country. In the years of reactionary rule, the Zhuang people were not recognized as a nation, so that many people, even the Zhuang people themselves, did not know that the Zhuang people existed. This is the fault of the reactionary rulers. Today, under the leadership of the Party, the Zhuang people are not only recognized as a single nation, but also have established an autonomous region at the provincial level. However, is there a film reflecting this nation? No. How many works reflect this nation? It can be said that there are very few. We all know that as early as the Great Revolution, the Party led struggles in the Zhuang areas. Under the leadership of their outstanding son, Comrade Wei Baqun, the Zhuang people persisted in unremitting struggles, leaving a deep impression on the people. Many revolutionary cadres persisted in guerrilla warfare for more than twenty years. After liberation, the Zhuang people have experienced earth-shaking changes. All of this can provide writers with inexhaustible materials, can’t it? If writers settle down in the areas inhabited by the Zhuang people and write more works about our nation, this will be the greatest satisfaction and encouragement for our Zhuang people.
The good example of writers The entire staff of the Maoming County Cultural Center in Guangdong Province

	We are a group of young mass cultural workers in the Maoming County Cultural Center in Guangdong Province, and also young recruits on the literary and art front. After seeing the People's Daily editorial: "We must have a strong contingent of working-class literature and art," we happily gathered together and had a heated discussion. We believe that this editorial is a great call from the Party to literary and art workers across the country, and we resolutely support the Party's call.

	The Party pointed out that the only way to build a strong working-class literary and art contingent and to prosper socialist literature and art "is to closely integrate literary and art workers with the workers and peasants. They should always live among the masses and participate in production struggles and class struggles together with the masses." We feel that the correctness of this instruction has been well proven by the historical facts of the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation. There is no doubt that in the eight years since liberation, our writers have also written many good works, which have played a good role in educating and inspiring the masses to struggle for the construction of a socialist society. These achievements cannot be denied. But we cannot fail to notice this important fact: socialist literature and art is far behind the needs of the masses. In the eight years since liberation, the number of new and more outstanding works is still small and cannot meet the urgent needs of the masses. Take our Guangdong as an example. Like the rest of the country, farmers in our province account for the vast majority. If we want to resolutely implement the policy of literature and art serving workers, peasants and soldiers, we must write more works reflecting the real life and struggle of farmers. But we cannot help but feel that the writers of the Guangzhou Branch of the Chinese Writers Association are not doing a satisfactory job in this regard. Hundreds of thousands of farmers, with the development of production and the improvement of life, urgently require a rich cultural life. The 183 amateur troupes in our county's 280-odd clubs often reach out to our cultural center for scripts, especially better scripts that reflect the real life and struggle of rural areas. There are too few of them, where can we find them? How headache! Especially in the past two years, the problem has become more prominent and serious. Often when amateur troupes reach out to us, we really have no way to deal with it, so we say, go to the Xinhua Bookstore to find them, but after flipping through them, most of them are still "Cannot Walk That Road", "Huanghuawan", "Raise Vigilance", "Half a Matchstick", "Mid-Autumn Night", "When Expanding the Society"... published before 1955. Some of these dramas have been watched by the masses more than five times, who will buy these scripts to perform these dramas? I remember last year, a troupe in Mutoutang Township had no scripts, so they had to perform "When Expanding the Society". The masses were very dissatisfied after watching it and blamed, "We have already transferred to the advanced cooperative, you are still performing the drama of joining the elementary cooperative, it is really backward! We won't watch it." As a result, the performance was forced to stop halfway. Similar situations also exist in poetry, novels and other popular reading materials. However, the writers of the Guangzhou Branch of the Chinese Writers Association always stay in the city, alienated from the peasant masses, and cannot hear the sound of the peasants' footsteps in rapid progress. How can they write poems and outstanding scripts that reflect the lives and struggles of the peasants?

	Now is the time, the Party has issued a call: Cultivate outstanding singers of the working class! The writers in Beijing have set a good example, going to the countryside, factories and companies without hesitation. Many writers are also determined to settle down in rural areas and mining areas for a long time. With a young heart of love and enthusiasm, we admire and welcome the resolute actions of many writers, and especially welcome Comrade Xiao Yin to come to our rural Guangdong. We also welcome Comrade Xiao Yin and any writer comrade of the Guangzhou Branch of the Chinese Writers Association to come to Maoming County, Zhanjiang District. In the years of reactionary rule, our Maonan Plain was once called "the hungry wilderness". Some people described it: a small drought if it doesn't rain for five days, a big drought if it doesn't rain for ten days, and a disaster if it doesn't rain for a month. In the eight years since liberation, more than 900,000 farmers in the county have been carrying out fierce, tense, and tenacious battles against historical natural disasters under the leadership of the Party every year. Everywhere is full of heroic deeds worthy of praise and heart-stirring. The heroic deeds like the arduous drought resistance in Longshou Township in 1954 that shocked the province and resounded throughout the country are many. Now, in order to resolutely eliminate historical disasters and let the name "hungry wilderness" disappear forever from the land of the motherland, the unprecedentedly huge "Yinjian" water conservancy project in the province, with 2.4 million cubic meters of earthwork, will start this year in December (to be completed by March 1958). More than 100,000 heroic labor forces will attack the land. A newly opened river that can navigate small electric boats will appear on the Maonan Plain. The clear and crystal green water will happily flow into more than 300,000 mu of arid rice fields. This is another great and glorious heroic achievement of the working people in transforming nature and seizing nature under the leadership of the Party.

	Dear writers, come on. We welcome you! We will introduce you in detail to the local characteristics, customs, and habits that we are familiar with, and help you provide various conditions for the smooth progress of creation. We also look forward to your guidance and help to us young recruits on the literary and art front.

	The actions of Beijing writers are a good example for us. We have decided to resolutely integrate closely with the peasant brothers, share weal and woe, invest more than one-third of our strength in the "Yinjian" water conservancy project, participate in labor, and conduct propaganda and mobilization work at the same time. Other comrades must also often go deep into the countryside and integrate with the masses, participate in their labor production and struggle, and also decided to try to move the editorial department of our museum's "Maoming Club Newspaper" to Xinpo Advanced Cooperative, in order to correct the past situation where editors were alienated from the masses and high above, and to have a closer relationship with the masses.

### 欢迎作家到工农兵群众中来！

    欢迎作家到工农兵群众中来！
    编者按：11月12日，本报发表了“要有一支强大的工人阶级的文艺队伍”的社论，和首都许多作家决心到工厂、农村、连队中去的报道以后，全国许多读者来信，坚决拥护党的这一号召——文艺工作者长期和工农兵群众相结合，并对首都许多作家到工农兵群众中去的行动和决心表示热烈欢迎。这里刊登的，只是一部分读者的来信。
    双手欢迎作家来俺们这里石家庄电业局供电管理所工人
                      刘印琴
    看了11月12日人民日报的“要有一支强大的工人阶级的文艺队伍”的社论和作家下厂下乡的消息后，简直不知用啥字眼来形容我的兴奋心情，只觉得仿佛我站在作家的面前，在同他们作亲切的握手，心里不断涌出这样的字眼：欢迎，欢迎，欢迎你们到来。
    我是个外线电工，在现实生活中，深深感到有许多可歌可泣的动人事迹，但我从未看到过描写外线工的一本小说。莫非俺们外线工成年累月、雪里雨里，不论严寒和烈日，顽强地工作着，许许多多困难都被俺们克服了，战胜了，许多数不过来的动人事迹不值得作家写吗？我想不是的，是作家没到俺们这里来。为工农兵服务是党的文艺方针，按说，反映工人生活的好作品应该多一些，但事实并不完全令人满意。这毛病我看就是出在作家没有在工人中生根。现在已有不少作家深入到工农群众中去，我相信，在不久的将来会出现大量的描写工农的好作品。我是个文艺爱好者，有许多英雄工人形象在脑子里常活动，但由于文化浅，写不出来。希望作家到俺们这儿来，写写我们吧。
    高举双手，欢迎，欢迎！
    欢迎你们到基层来
          宜昌市糖果商店　李　伟
    我是一个复员军人，曾经在部队作过一个时期文艺工作，平时也喜欢看些文艺作品。虽然解放几年来，作家们曾创作了大批优秀作品，但是还赶不上人民的要求。现仅举一个例子来说，我就很少看到作家们写点我们复员军人参加工厂、矿山、农村、企业等和平建设的作品。即或写了一点，也是太少了。近几年来，我们成千上万的复员军人响应党的号召，参加祖国的经济建设，在不同的岗位上，涌现出许许多多的优秀人物。有很多同志，保持了革命军人的光荣传统，在前方是杀敌英雄，回到后方又是生产战线上的模范。如1953年，宜昌市有七个复员军人，在党、政等各方面的支持下，将自己的生产资助金拿出来开设粉厂，开始每人不拿薪金，只吃饭，而后慢慢地每月拿几块钱，在工作中克服了许多困难，粉厂从无到有、从小到大，现在已发展成为地方国营。现在厂内大部分职工是复员军人，无论党的什么号召他们都是带头积极响应。这些英雄事迹，是不胜枚举的。作家们去歌颂，让人们去学习他们不怕困难、勇往直前的精神吧！
    所以这次作家们长期地深入到基层，这的确是大喜事，我欢迎你们。
    作家们，欢迎你们来！
                      战士　周彭年
    11月12日黎明，我听到中央人民广播电台报告的新闻节目里，作家到工厂、农村、部队中去，要和劳动人民同甘共苦，参加体力劳动，要到连队和士兵们一起生活。这消息，真使我高兴。我想起魏巍的“谁是最可爱的人”，陆柱国的“上甘岭”等作品。作品里那些英雄们，多么值得人们敬佩啊。
    在现实生活中，我亲眼看到将军给士兵做饭（当然是假日），看到带着伤疤的排长、连长和经过抗美援朝的老战士在和平建设和军事训练中的英雄本色。
    我多次拿起笔来想写下他们动人的事迹，可是我文化水平低，写不出，不能达到我的希望。现在听到你们——人类灵魂的工程师们将要到连队、农村、工厂来参加劳动，和工农兵群众长期生活在一起，并进行创作，我是多么高兴啊。
    到兄弟民族地区去
      中央民族学院僮族学生　苏达民
    我是一个僮族青年，多少年来，曾从我尊敬的作家们的优秀作品中吸取许多精神滋养，丰富了我的知识，给我增加了不少力量。有的作家还不辞劳苦地深入到我们少数民族地区，写出反映我们各兄弟民族的生活和斗争的优秀作品。如今还有不少作家正在兄弟民族地区生活，并正在进行这方面的创作。这是我十分高兴的。当我们在民族学院的礼堂里，每每看到关于少数民族的影片时，我们各民族的同学都是报以最热烈的、长久的掌声。我们多么希望作家们深入我们少数民族地区，多写些反映我们少数民族生活和斗争的诗篇啊！
    我们僮族，是全国少数民族人口最多的民族。在反动统治的年代里，僮族是不被承认的一个民族，以至有好多人，甚至僮族人民也不知道有这个僮族存在。这都是反动统治者的罪过。今天在党的领导下，僮族不但被承认为单一民族，而且又成立省一级的自治区。可是，关于这个民族，有一部反映她的影片没有？没有。有多少反映这个民族的作品？可以说很少很少。我们大家都知道，早在大革命时代，党就在僮族地区领导斗争，僮族人民在其优秀的儿女——韦拔群同志领导下坚持过不懈的斗争，给人民留下了深刻的印象。多少革命干部坚持了二十几年的游击战争。解放以后，僮族人民又经历了翻天复地的变化。所有这一切，不是可以提供给作家们取之不尽的材料吗？如果作家到僮族居住的地区去安家落户，多写有关我们民族的作品，这对我们僮族人民将是最大的满足和鼓舞。作家们的良好榜样广东省茂名县文化馆全体工作人员
    我们是广东省茂名县文化馆一群年轻的群众文化工作者，也是文艺战线上的小新兵。我们看到人民日报的社论：“要有一支强大的工人阶级的文艺队伍”后，我们快活地围在一起，展开了热烈的讨论，我们认为这篇社论是党向全国文艺工作者发出的伟大号召，我们坚决拥护党的这一号召。
    党指出建立一支强大的工人阶级文艺队伍和繁荣社会主义文艺唯一的途径“是要使文艺工作者和工农群众密切结合，他们应该永远生活在群众之中，和群众一起参加生产斗争和阶级斗争”。我们觉得，这一指示的正确性，从过去抗日战争和解放战争的历史事实中，已经得到了很好的证明。无可怀疑，解放以来的八年中，我们的作家也写了不少的好作品，对教育鼓舞群众为建设社会主义社会而斗争，起了好的作用，这些成绩是不容抹煞的。但是我们却不能不注意到这样一个重要的事实，社会主义文艺是大大落后在群众需要的后面了。解放八年来，新的和较杰出的作品还是为数不多，还不能满足群众的迫切要求。就拿我们广东来说吧，像全国一样，我省农民是占绝大多数的，我们要坚决贯彻文艺为工农兵服务的方针，也就得多写反映农民的现实生活和斗争的作品。可是我们不能不感到中国作家协会广州分会的作家们，在这方面是做得不能令人满意的。成千上万的农民随着生产发展和生活的改善，迫切要求丰富的文化生活，我县二百八十多个俱乐部的一百八十三个业余剧团，他们经常向我们文化馆伸手要剧本，特别是反映农村现实生活斗争的较好的剧本，真是太少了，哪里去找呢？多头痛呵！特别近两年来，问题显得更突出和严重了。往往业余剧团向我们伸手，我们实在没办法对付了，便说你们到新华书店去找吧，但是翻来翻去多数还是1955年前出版的“不能走那条路”“黄花湾”“提高警惕”“半截火柴”“中秋之夜”“扩社的时候”……，这些戏有些群众已看过五次以上了，谁还买这些剧本演这些戏呢？记得去年木头塘乡有一个剧团因没剧本，只得演“扩社的时候”，群众看了十分不满，责备说：“我们已转高级社了，你们还演入初级社的戏，真落后！我们不看了。”结果演至中途被迫停演了。在诗歌、小说等通俗读物方面，也存在着类似的情况。可是中国作家协会广州分会的作家们，却老是留在城市，脱离了农民群众，听不到农民的脚步在快速前进中的音响，怎能写出反映农民生活和斗争的诗篇，杰出的剧本呢。
    现在是时候了，党已发出了号召：培养工人阶级的出色歌手！北京的作家们已作出了良好的榜样，毫不迟疑地到农村、工厂和连队去，许多作家还决心在农村、工矿区长期安家落户，我们怀着一颗敬爱的炙热的年青的心，钦仰和欢迎许多作家们的坚决行动，特别欢迎萧殷同志到我们广东农村来。我们更欢迎萧殷同志和中国作家协会广州分会的任何一个作家同志到我们湛江专区茂名县来。我们茂南平原过去在反动统治的年代里，曾称为“饥饿的荒原”，有人形容它：五日不雨则小旱，十日不雨则大旱，一月不雨则成灾。解放八年来全县九十多万农民，每年在党的领导下，和历史性的自然灾害进行着激烈、紧张、顽强的战斗，到处充满着值得歌颂的、动人心魄的英雄事迹。像龙首乡1954年艰苦抗旱的那样震动全省、响彻全国的英雄事迹是很多的。现在党为了坚决消灭历史性的灾难，让“饥饿荒原”的名词永远从祖国的土地上消失，全省空前巨大的挖二百四十万土方的“引鉴”水利工程，即将于本年12月开始（至1958年3月完成），十多万英勇劳动大军，就要向土地进攻了，一条新开的可以航行小电船的河道，即将在茂南平原出现，清澈晶莹的绿水，将快活地流进三十多万亩干旱的稻田。这是劳动人民在党的领导下改造自然夺取自然的又一伟大光辉的英雄业绩。
    亲爱的作家们，你们来吧。我们欢迎你！我们会详尽地给你们介绍我们所熟悉的地方特点，风土人情、习惯，和帮助你们为顺利进行创作提供各种条件。更热望你们对我们这些文艺战线上的小新兵进行指导帮助。
    北京作家们的行动是我们良好的榜样，我们已决定坚决和农民兄弟密切结合，同甘共苦，将三分之一以上的力量投入“引鉴”水利工程中去，参加劳动，同时进行宣传鼓动工作，其他同志也要经常深入农村和群众打成一片，参加他们的劳动生产和斗争，同时还决定试行把我馆的“茂名俱乐部报”编辑部，搬到新坡高级社去，以改正过去编者脱离群众，高高在上的情况，更密切的联系群众。
