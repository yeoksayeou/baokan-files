Xinhua News Agency, New York, November 16th: According to a TASS report from New York, an article by American magnate Cyrus Eaton published in the "New York Herald Tribune" on the 12th, opposing the government's continued arms race and advocating "seeking common ground" between the United States and the Soviet Union, has aroused widespread reaction from the American public. The "New York Herald Tribune" on the 13th published many letters from readers agreeing with Eaton's views.

In his article, Eaton said that the Soviet Union already possesses modern weapons, and that continuing the arms race under such circumstances is meaningless. Eaton wrote: "Don't go on bothering Russia, let it study its own economic theories and practical affairs... We should stop boasting about ourselves and stop slandering others, whether they are Chinese or Russian."

Kellner of Great Neck, New York, wrote in a letter to the editor: "Millions of Americans, if possible, would support Eaton, who has a political mind, and oppose Dulles' brinkmanship and stopgap policies."

Houston of Radnor, Pennsylvania, said that the ideas expressed in Eaton's article are "a bold idea, one that America has needed since the end of World War II."

Gerhard of Summit, New Jersey, wrote: "It is amazing that government agencies do not listen to (Eaton's) advice."

Schwartzbart of New York pointed out, "In the current crisis, it is not enough for national leaders to simply try to calm people's well-founded fears. National leaders should rekindle hope for universal peace among the people and tell them that there is a way out of the Cold War siege."

Xinhua News Agency, Cambridge, Massachusetts, November 16th: Fred Whipple, director of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, said on the 13th, when talking about the fact that American scientific progress lags behind the Soviet Union, that this "does not depend on (American) scientists, but on high-level decision-makers in the government." He complained that the U.S. government's "policies and funding are constantly changing," preventing U.S. scientists from "conducting research at the level they should have already achieved."

Whipple admitted that in the Soviet Union, scientific progress is faster than in the United States. He said that more young people there are interested in the field of science because scientists there have prestige and high incomes (compared to American scientists).

He believes that in order for American science to catch up with the Soviet Union, it is necessary to fundamentally "improve the social and economic status of science teachers in middle schools." He said that now "an American science teacher can only get a subsistence salary (equal to one-third of the salary of workers with the same abilities in the industrial sector), so it is difficult to expect students to have a great interest in science and technology."

    美国一企业家主张和平共处
    认为军备竞赛已经毫无意义
    许多人支持他的意见要求突破冷战重围
    新华社16日讯  据塔斯社纽约消息：美国大企业家赛鲁斯·以顿12日在“纽约先驱论坛报”发表的一篇反对政府继续军备竞赛、主张在美国和苏联之间“寻求共同基础”的文章，引起美国公众的广泛反应，13日的“纽约先驱论坛报”刊出了许多同意以顿观点的读者来信。
    以顿在文章中说，苏联已经拥有现代武器，在这种情况下继续进行军备竞赛是毫无意义的。以顿写道：不要再去打扰俄国，让它去研究自己的经济理论和实际事务……我们应当停止吹嘘自己，停止诽谤别人，不管是中国人还是俄国人。
    纽约州大涅克的凯尔纳在读者来信中写道：“千百万美国人，如果有可能便会支持有政治头脑的以顿，而反对杜勒斯的战争边缘和临时应付的政策。”
    宾夕法尼亚州拉德诺尔的休斯顿说，以顿文章里阐明的思想，是“一种大胆的思想，自从第二次世界大战结束以来美国就需要这样一种思想”。
    新泽西州萨米特的格哈德写道：“政府机关不倾听（以顿）这样的劝告，真是令人惊奇。”
    纽约的施瓦次巴特指出，“在当前危机的情况下，国家领导人单单企图平息人民的有根据的恐惧心理是不够的。国家领导人应当在人民中间重新唤起对普遍和平的希望，告诉他们有突破冷战重围的出路。”
    新华社16日讯  马萨诸塞州剑桥消息：美国史密森氏天体物理天文台台长弗雷德·惠普耳13日在谈到美国科学进展落后于苏联时说，这“不取决于（美国）科学家，而是取决于政府的高级决策人”。他抱怨美国政府“政策和基金变化不定”，使美国科学家“没有机会在本该已经获得的水平上进行研究”。
    惠普耳承认，在苏联，科学进步要比美国快。他说，那里有更多的青年人对科学领域很感兴趣，因为那里的科学家（比美国科学家）有声望而且收入高。
    他认为要使美国的科学赶上苏联，必须从根本上“提高中学里科学教员的社会地位和经济地位”做起。他说，现在“一个美国科学教员只能得到糊口的薪金（等于工业部门中有相同能力的工薪收入者所得的三分之一），这就很难希望学生们对科学和技术发生很大的兴趣”。
