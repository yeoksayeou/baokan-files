    The first generating unit of the Shangyou Hydropower Station Generates Electricity
    Xinhua News Agency, November 13th: The first generating unit of China's first dam-internal powerhouse hydropower station, the Shangyou Hydropower Station, has recently begun generating electricity. This hydropower station is built at Tieshanguan on the Shangyou River, a tributary of the Gan River in southern Jiangxi, about seventy kilometers from Ganzhou. The hydro-turbine generators are all installed inside the concrete dam body, eliminating the need to build a separate powerhouse, thus greatly reducing construction costs.
    The construction of this hydropower station began in March 1955. Currently, all construction personnel are carrying out finishing work. (Attached picture)

    上犹水电站第一台机组发电
    据新华社13日讯　我国第一座坝内式厂房水电站——上犹水电站，第一台机组已在最近开始发电。这座水电站建筑在江西南部赣江支流上犹江的铁扇关，离赣州约七十公里。水轮发电机全部安装在混凝土坝体内，不需要另外建造厂房，因此大大降低了造价。
    这座水电站是在1955年3月动工修建的。现在，全体建设人员正在进行收尾工程。（附图片）
