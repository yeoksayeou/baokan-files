Guangdong Rural Areas Enter the Great Debate
    Refuting Various Fallacies of Rich Middle Peasants

    (Our Dispatch) Reporter Lin Li reports: The socialist education in Guangdong's rural areas has shifted from extensive airing of views and debate to a great debate. Materials from various locations show that the problems raised during this airing of views and debate are "tens of thousands," covering a wide range of aspects. The debates are exceptionally intense, with the number of participants in many places exceeding all previous movements since the land reform. Through airing views and debates, peasants have recognized the harm of capitalism, established their belief in socialism, and cadres of organizations and rural workers have clarified many confused concepts and corrected many erroneous understandings.

    The Truth About the "Golden Age"

    For a long time, the saying of "two golden ages" has been circulating in Guangdong. One of these periods refers to around 1935, when Chen Jitang was the provincial chairman, also known as the "Chen Jitang era"; the other refers to 1953, after the land reform and before the collectivization, saying that there were "four major freedoms" at that time, which was the best period for getting rich. This discussion was popular in rural areas and also in cities; ordinary people were randomly clamoring about it, and some cadres were blindly echoing it. In Shunde County, where cash crops dominated, this argument was especially prevalent. In many places, the debate could not proceed without clarifying these issues.

    In order to clarify the truth about the "golden age," Shayong Township in Shunde County conducted several days of intensive debate. People represented by rich middle peasants said that in the "Chen Jitang era," "a boat of silk went out, and a boat of silver came back." Shayong Township had seven silk weaving factories, five tea houses, and six meat and wine shops, as well as electric lights and telephones. They said that at that time, "silver dollars clanked, and banknotes were grabbed in handfuls." People represented by poor peasants admitted the above facts, but this was only one aspect of the facts; on the other hand: beggars stood in front of the taverns, brothels opened next to the tea houses, and unemployed people were in front of the silk factories... The result of capital concentration and land concentration was that a large number of middle peasants became poor peasants, and poor peasants became landless farm laborers. At the peak of that golden age, in one natural village in Shayong Township, forty or fifty people died of starvation. In addition, twenty-three households sold their children, and four people committed suicide. The so-called "grabbing banknotes in handfuls" only applied to twenty-five households out of the 1,500 households in the whole township, all of whom were landlords, rich peasants, and capitalists. Therefore, the poor peasants said that the "Chen Jitang era" was a gloomy and terrible dark age. This dark age not only disregarded the lives and deaths of the working people, but also disregarded national defense construction. As a result, it invited the invasion of Japanese imperialism and caused the great famine of 1943. At that time, the population of Shunde County was reduced by half due to the dual attacks of natural and man-made disasters. Daliang Town, which originally had a population of 80,000, had only 20,000 left after the disaster. Shayong Township, which had 1,500 households, was reduced by 500 households at once. Speaking of this, people realized the truth of the "golden age" and further understood the essence of capitalism.

    The rich middle peasants admitted defeat, but they brought up 1953, saying that it was the world led by the Communist Party, which was better than now. One person named Chen Xipei said, "If collectivization had been delayed for two more years, I would have made a fortune." Another poor peasant named He Ming immediately retorted, "If collectivization had been delayed for two more years, I would have gone bankrupt!" Two opposing opinions sparked a debate. Because no one could convince anyone else, they calculated the accounts again. The rich middle peasants, based on the situation at that time, added together people similar to Chen Xipei who might "make a fortune"; the poor peasants put together people similar to He Ming who might go bankrupt. The final result was: thirty-seven households that could potentially rise, accounting for a little over 3% of the total number of households; and as many as four hundred and seventy households that could potentially go bankrupt, accounting for more than 40% of the total number of households. This shows that if the "four major freedoms" are not abolished, and if individual peasants are not quickly organized, polarization will occur even under the proletarian regime.

    After refuting the above statement, Shuangshui Agricultural Cooperative in Xinhui County further investigated the present situation. After this investigation, people's eyes were brightened and their consciousness was raised. People said: "Collectivization is like a dwarf climbing a tall building, rising step by step, and getting better every year." And found the "ten major changes" and "twenty-plus" after collectivization. The ten major changes are: poor peasants become rich, lack of grain becomes surplus grain, barren fields become fertile fields, rivers become fish ponds, beaches become lotus ponds, single crops become double crops, intercropping becomes continuous cropping, open spaces become threshing grounds, lazy people become diligent, and illiterate people become literate. The twenty-plus are: more grain production, more income, more orchards, more lotus ponds, more fish ponds, more cattle, more ducks, more pigs, more sideline occupations, more water conservancy construction, more fertilizer accumulation, more savings, more eating, more clothing, more opera watching, more people reading and writing, more public accumulation, etc. People put these together and said that only after collectivization is the golden age for peasants, and this road of common prosperity is the road of socialism.

    The Income of the Vast Majority of Rich Middle Peasants Has Not Decreased

    During the extensive airing of views and debates, rich middle peasants exposed their dissatisfaction with collectivization, and at the same time created many "reasons" for dividing the cooperatives, dissolving the cooperatives, and withdrawing from the cooperatives. It is impossible to guide the debate to right and wrong if these "reasons" are not refuted. Based on the existing materials, the main "reasons" of the rich middle peasants are that their income has decreased after joining the cooperative, and that the poor peasants have exploited the rich middle peasants.

    Speaking of the reduced income of rich middle peasants, many rural workers in Guangdong, and even some quite responsible cadres, also admit that this is a "fact." However, the Xinhui County Party Committee denied this fact after calculating the accounts. Before the land reform, there were 10,865 rich middle peasant households in Xinhui County. After joining the cooperative, 70% of the rich middle peasants increased their income, and 20% maintained their income. In Muzhou District, 928 rich middle peasant households increased their income by an average of 150 yuan per household. The most typical example in this district is Zhang Zhuohao. His family has 29 people and 8 laborers. Many people said that his family's income decreased after joining the cooperative. However, after calculating the accounts, Zhang Zhuohao's family also increased its income by 33%. In Ganggang Township in Nanhai County, the noise was very loud at the beginning of the airing of views and debates, and the shouts of reduced income even confused the minds of many cadres. However, the calculation result showed that out of 281 households in the township, 260 households increased their income, and three households maintained their income, accounting for 93%. In Jinmen Township in Shunde County, at the beginning of the debate, the income account of Li Boliu, the richest of the old upper-middle peasants in the entire township who shouted the loudest, was selected, and as a result, this family increased its income by 200 yuan compared with before joining the cooperative. After the accounts were cleared, other rich middle peasants said: "If Li Boliu's family has not reduced its income, our accounts do not need to be calculated. We admit that collectivization is superior." Materials from various places prove that the rich middle peasants whose income has decreased generally do not exceed 10%. And most of them are because their daughters got married, their sons went to school, their labor force migrated out, and they lost money in commercial speculation. There are phenomena that the poor management of cooperatives affects the reduction of income of rich middle peasants, but the number is extremely small.

    Who Exploits Whom?

    The rich middle peasants said: "We joined the cooperative with耕牛, land and farm tools, while the poor peasants joined the cooperative with bare butts." They also said: "The superiority of the cooperative, the first year depends on the land of the middle peasants, the second year depends on the耕牛 and farm tools of the middle peasants, and the third year there is no more superiority." Their conclusion is that "the poor peasants exploit the middle peasants, and the middle peasants suffer losses," so they want to withdraw from the cooperative and dissolve the cooperative. Rural workers certainly disagree with the middle peasants withdrawing from the cooperative, but when it comes to "exploitation", they also say: "A little exploitation is necessary." But in this debate, the vast number of poor peasants do not recognize this account. They said with confidence: "We don't have耕牛 or farm tools, but we joined the cooperative with bank's耕牛 loans and farm tools loans." For this matter, Longgang Cooperative in Panyu County also specifically calculated the accounts. This cooperative has 121 rich middle peasant households. The耕牛, farm tools, and investments they brought into the cooperative averaged 161 yuan per household. The 712 poor peasant households, the above three items added together, averaged 188 yuan per household, 27 yuan more than the upper-middle peasants. Originally, at the beginning of joining the cooperative, the rich middle peasants did not take out all the farm tools, and some sold耕牛 to join the cooperative. The poor peasants in Huaxian not only did not admit that they exploited the middle peasants, but also said that the middle peasants took advantage of the poor peasants. They listed more than ten evidences in a row, one of which is that the poor peasants paid public grain for the middle peasants. They said that before joining the cooperative, the public grain paid by the poor peasants did not exceed 13% of the output, while the rich middle peasants paid 20%. After collectivization, the public grain was paid uniformly by the cooperative, which invisibly assumed the obligation for the middle peasants. At the same time, the attendance rate of poor peasants is generally higher than that of rich middle peasants, which further increases the burden of poor peasants.

    The Debate Is Not Over

    After the debate, the demands of the rich middle peasants to withdraw from the cooperative and dissolve the cooperative are generally no longer mentioned. But this does not mean that capitalist ideas have been completely overcome. Facts have proved that after the great debate, capitalist ideas represented by rich middle peasants still exist, and in some places it is quite serious. According to the regulations of the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee, the stage after the great debate is the stage of improving work. In this stage, we must formulate production plans, discuss contracting work to groups and assigning output quotas, and labor discipline. Some townships and cooperatives with faster progress have already begun to solve these problems. These townships and cooperatives have found that even some people who are convinced and admit that their thinking is clear in the great debate will still resist when they encounter specific problems. For example, when discussing contracting work to groups and assigning output quotas, many people put forward the slogan of "assigning output quotas to households and assuming responsibility for profits and losses." If they are promised "can be considered" or "can be discussed," they will further propose: "Returning things to their original owners, the original place follows the original person", or "free combination, contracting output to groups"... This, in fact, still wants to "go it alone within the cooperative" and take the road of so-called collective capitalism. For another example, when discussing labor discipline, because many rich middle peasants have less attendance and are not active, the poor peasants unanimously advocated stipulating a number of working days per year, with rewards for those who exceed the number and penalties for those who do not meet the number. But the rich middle peasants disagreed. They said: "Since the cooperative pays according to work, why stipulate the number of working days? Anyway, whoever works less will get less pay!" At first glance, this statement is also reasonable, but the trained poor peasants immediately exposed it and said: "You still want to be spontaneous, you can't do without regulations."

    The stage of improving work is by no means the end of the debate, let alone the complete completion of ideological remolding. Therefore, the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China pointed out at a recent meeting: The stage of improving work is the continuation of the great debate. Some ideological problems that have not been resolved must continue to be resolved, and ideological problems encountered in improving work must not be let go. All methods must be used to carry out socialist education to the end.

    广东农村转入大争
    驳倒富裕中农的各种谬论
    本报讯  记者林里报道：广东农村的社会主义教育，已由大鸣大放转到了大争大辩。来自各地的材料表明，这次鸣放出来的问题“成千成万”，方面相当广，争辩也异常激烈，参加辩论的人数，许多地方都超过了土地改革以来的历次运动。通过鸣放和争辩，农民认清了资本主义的危害，确立了社会主义的信念，机关干部和农村工作者，也澄清了许多糊涂观念，纠正了许多错误认识。
    “黄金时代”的真象
    长期以来，广东地方流传着所谓“两个黄金时代”的说法。这两个时代，一个是指1935年前后，陈济棠当省主席的时候，也有人叫“陈济棠时代”；另一个是指土地改革以后、合作化以前的1953年，说那时有“四大自由”，是发家致富的最好时期。这种议论，流行在农村，也流行在城市；普通群众这样乱嚷嚷，某些干部也跟着瞎吵吵。在经济作物占优势的顺德县，这种论调尤其普遍。许多地方，不把这些问题弄清，辩论就无法进行。
    为了弄清“黄金时代”的真象，顺德县沙?乡曾经进行了好几天的大辩论。以富裕中农为代表的人们，说在“陈济棠时代”是“一船蚕丝去，一船白银归”。沙?乡有七个丝织厂，五个茶楼，六家酒肉铺，还有电灯电话。说那时是“银元当当响，钞票大把抓”。以贫农为代表的人们，承认上述事实，但这只是事实的一方面；另一方面是：酒馆门前站着乞丐，茶楼旁边开着妓院，丝厂门口是失业的人群……资本集中和土地集中的结果，是大批中农变成了贫农，贫农变成了一无所有的雇农。就在那个黄金时代的最盛时期，沙?乡的一个自然村，就有四、五十个人饥饿而死。另有二十三户人家卖了儿女，还有四个人自杀。所谓“钞票大把抓”的，在全乡一千五百户中，只不过二十五户，全是地主、富农兼资本家。因此，贫农们说，“陈济棠时代”是阴森可怕的黑暗时代。这个黑暗时代不光不顾劳动人民的死活，而且不顾国防建设。因而招致了日本帝国主义的侵略，招致了1943年的大灾荒。在那时候天灾人祸双重袭击，顺德县的人口减少了一半。原有八万人口的大良镇，灾荒过后只剩下了二万。拥有一千五百户人家的沙?乡，一下减少了五百户。说起这些，人们认识了“黄金时代”的真象，也进一步认识了资本主义的实质。
    富裕中农认输了，但他们提出了1953年，说那时候是共产党领导的天下，比现在好。有一位叫陈锡培的说：“合作化再迟二年，我就发了大财”。另一位叫何明的贫农，立刻起来反驳说：“合作化再迟二年，我就破产啦！”两个针锋相对的意见，引起了一场争论。因为谁都说不服谁，便又算了一笔账。富裕中农根据那时的情况，把类似陈锡培，又可能“发财”的人加在一起；贫农方面把类似何明，又可能破产的人凑在一堆，最后结果是：可能上升的三十七户，占总户数3％强；可能破产的多达四百七十户，占总户数的40％以上。这就说明：如果不把“四大自由”取消，如果不把个体农民迅速组织起来，就在工人阶级政权下，也会发生两极分化。
    新会县双水农业社在驳斥了上述说法以后，还进一步查现在。这一查，人们的眼睛亮了，觉悟提高了。人们说：“合作化好比矮子上高楼，步步升高，一年好似一年。”并且找出了合作化后的“十大变化”和“二十多”。这十大变化是：贫农变富裕，缺粮变余粮，瘦田变肥田，河沟变鱼塘，沙滩变藕池，单造变双造，间作变连作，空地变禾场，懒汉变勤劳，文盲变识字。二十多是：增产粮食多，增加收入多，果园多，藕池多，鱼塘多，牛多，鸭多，猪多，副业多，水利建设多，积肥多，存款多，吃多，穿多，看戏多，读书识字的人多，公共积累多等等。人们把这些综合起来，说只是合作化以后，才是农民的黄金时代，这种大家富裕的道路，才是社会主义的道路。
    绝大部分富裕中农的收入没有减少
    在大放大鸣当中，富裕中农暴露了对合作化的不满，同时也制造了许多分社、散社和退社的“理由”。不把这些“理由”驳倒，就不可能把辩论引向大是大非。就现有材料来看，富裕中农的主要“理由”是说入社后减少了收入，说贫农揩了中农的油。
    说起富裕中农减少收入，广东不少农村工作者，甚至一些相当负责的干部，也承认这是“事实”。但是新会县委算了一笔账就否定了这个事实。新会县土改前有一万零八百六十五户富裕中农，入社后，富裕中农增收的占70％，保收的占20％。睦州区九百二十八户富裕中农，平均每户增加收入一百五十元。这个区最典型的例子是张卓豪，他家二十九口人，八个劳动力，许多人都说他家入社后减少收入。但经过算账以后，张卓豪家也增加收入33％。南海县的?岗乡，鸣放开始吵吵得很厉害，减少收入的叫嚣，甚至弄昏了许多干部的头脑。但是算账结果，全乡二百八十一户中，增加收入的二百六十户，保收的三户，占93％。顺德县的金门乡，辩论开始就挑选了一户叫嚷最凶、全乡最富的老上中农李伯流家算收入账，结果，这家比入社前增加了二百元的收入。账目算清后，其他富裕中农就说：“李伯流家都没有减少收入，我们的账就不用算了，我们承认合作化优越就是了。”各地材料证明，减少收入的富裕中农，一般不超过10％。而且多是因为闺女出嫁，儿子上学，劳动力外迁，再就是做商业投机赔了钱。因为合作社经营管理不好，影响富裕中农减少收入的现象是存在的，但为数极少。
    谁揩谁的油？
    富裕中农们说：“我们是带着耕牛、土地和农具入社的，贫农是光着屁股入社的。”又说：“合作社的优越性，第一年是靠中农的土地，第二年是靠中农的耕牛和农具，第三年就再也没有什么优越性了。”他们的结论是说，“贫农揩了中农的油，中农吃了亏”，因此要退社，散社。农村工作者当然不同意中农退社，但说到“揩油”，也说：“揩是要揩一点的。”但在这次辩论中，广大贫农就不认这笔账。他们理直气壮地说：“我们没有耕牛、农具，但我们是带着银行的耕牛贷款、农具贷款入社的。”为了这件事，番禺县的龙岗社，也专门算了一笔账。这个社有富裕中农一百二十一户，他们入社时带来的耕牛、农具和投资加在一起，平均每户合一百六十一元。贫农七百十二户，上述三项加在一起，每户平均是一百八十八元，比上中农还多二十七元。原来入社当初，富裕中农并没有拿出全部农具，有的是卖了耕牛入社的。花县贫农不但不承认揩了中农的油，而且说中农沾了贫农的光。他们一连列举了十多条证据，其中有一条是，贫农替中农交了公粮。他们说，入社前，贫农交公粮不超过产量的13％，富裕中农是20％。合作化后，公粮由社统一交纳，就无形中替中农承担了义务。同时，贫农出勤率一般比富裕中农高，这就更增加了贫农的负担。
    争辩并没有完结
    经过争论和辩驳，富裕中农的退社、散社要求，一般不再提了。但这绝不是说，资本主义思想已经彻底克服了。事实证明，大辩论以后，以富裕中农为代表的资本主义思想，还是存在的，有些地方是相当严重的。根据广东省委的规定，大辩论后是改进工作的阶段。在这个阶段要制定生产规划，要讨论包工包产和劳动纪律。有些进度较快的乡和社，已着手解决这些问题了。这些乡、社发现，就是有些心服口服、在大辩论中承认思想通了的人，一碰到具体问题，还会起来对抗的。比如讨论包工包产的时候，很多人就提出“包产到户、自负盈亏”的口号，假如答应他们“可以考虑”、或者“可以讨论”，他们就会进一步提出：“完璧归赵，原地跟原人”，或者是“自由组合，包产到组”……。这，实际上还是想“社内单干”，走所谓集体资本主义的道路。又比如，在讨论劳动纪律的时候，因为很多富裕中农出勤少，不积极，所以贫农们一致主张规定一个每年出工的数目，超过者奖，不足者罚。但是富裕中农就不同意。他们说：“既然合作社是按劳取酬，又何必规定工数呢？反正谁出工少，谁取的报酬就少呀！”乍一听，这话也满有理由，但经过锻炼的贫农，立刻揭露说：“你还想自发呀，不规定不成。”
    改进工作的阶段，绝不是辩论的结束，更不是思想改造的全部完成。因此，中共广东省委在最近一次会议上指出：改进工作的阶段，是大争大辩的继续。有些没有解决了的思想问题，要继续解决，在改进工作上遇到的思想问题，同样不能放过，要用一切办法，把社会主义教育贯彻到底。
