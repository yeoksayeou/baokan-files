    Practicing Diligence and Thrift in Running Schools, Using Our Brains
    Nanjing Institute of Technology Self-Made Cupola Furnace
    In order to do a good job in experiments and scientific research, the Casting Laboratory of the Mechanical Engineering Department of Nanjing Institute of Technology needed to build a 1.5-ton cupola furnace. Originally, it was planned to design it themselves and then contract it out to external units, but the cost would be about 20,000 yuan, and the time could not be guaranteed. Moreover, the teaching and research group could not come up with complete design drawings at the time. Now, under the guidance of Mr. Liu Yuanwen of the Casting Teaching and Research Group and Mr. Zhu Qinggang of the Casting Research Office, it has been successfully manufactured by the Repair and Manufacturing Factory.
    From leaders to technicians, the Repair and Manufacturing Factory attached special importance to this work. For example, cold work master Liu Guangquan gave up his entire summer vacation and Sundays in the hot summer and worked tirelessly to lead all the staff (including temporary workers). He actively used his brains in his work, using a large number of old bolts instead of new ones; taking advantage of the Nanjing Boiler Factory's rest time at night to borrow the factory's machines to roll steel plates; and taking advantage of various opportunities to understand the ideological situation of temporary workers and solve problems.
    The external units estimated that manufacturing this cupola furnace would take 4,518 man-hours, while the actual time spent was 1,700 man-hours, saving 2,818 man-hours; the estimated salary was 12,000 yuan, while the actual salary paid was less than 300 yuan (excluding the salaries of the school staff who participated in the work); in terms of raw materials, substitutes were used as much as possible, saving more than 5,000 yuan.
    At present, the construction of the furnace is basically completed and is about to be installed, and it will be put into experimental use soon.

    勤俭办学，开动脑筋
    南京工学院自制冲天炉
    南京工学院机械系铸工实验室为了做好实验与科学研究工作，需造一个一吨半冲天炉。原拟自行设计后，交校外单位包制，但工本费约需二万多元，时间也不能保证，而且教研组一时也拿不出完整的设计图纸。现在铸工教研组刘远文先生及铸工研究室朱庆刚先生的指导下，已由修造工厂制造成功了。
    修造工厂从领导到技工都特别重视这项工作。如冷作工刘光全老师傅在炎热的夏天，放弃了整个暑假和星期日，不辞辛劳的领导着全体工作人员（包括临时工）进行工作。他在工作中积极开动了脑筋，大量利用旧螺栓代替新螺栓；利用南京锅炉厂晚上休息时间，借该厂机器来轧滚钢板；利用各种机会了解临时工的思想情况，解决问题。
    制造这个冲天炉，校外单位估计工时为四千五百一十八工时，而实际用去一千七百工时，节省二千八百工时；估计工资为一万二千元，而目前实际上付出工资还不到三百元（不包括本校参加工作的工作人员工资）；原材料方面，也尽量利用代用品，节约人民币约五千元以上。
    目前该炉子施工已基本上完毕，即将进行安装，不日可以投入实验。
