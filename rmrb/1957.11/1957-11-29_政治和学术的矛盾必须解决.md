Newspaper Article Abstract:

    The contradiction between politically supporting socialism and academically still being attached to bourgeois philosophy and social sciences must be resolved. It is impossible to maintain this contradiction for a long time. This contradiction must be resolved. There are two routes to resolve this contradiction. One route is the one pointed out by the bourgeois rightists, which is to insist on the bourgeois viewpoint academically and strive for its leading position, even to the point of reactionary political stances. If we refuse to take this dangerous route, then we must insist on using the proletarian worldview to improve ourselves, continue to expand the realm of Marxist dominance in our minds, and make Marxism truly become our complete worldview. (Excerpt from Hu Sheng's "Striving for the Complete Victory of the Proletarian Worldview" in the twenty-second issue of Study Bi-monthly, 1957)

    政治和学术的矛盾必须解决
    在政治上拥护社会主义，在学术上对资产阶级哲学、社会科学还有所留恋，这是一个矛盾。长期保存这种矛盾是不可能的。这个矛盾必须得到解决。解决这个矛盾有两条路线。一条路线是资产阶级右派所指出的路线，那就是坚持学术上的资产阶级观点，并且为它争取领导地位，以至一直走到政治上的反动立场。如果拒绝走这条危险的路线，那就必须坚持用无产阶级世界观改进自己，继续扩大在自己头脑中的马克思主义的统治领域，使马克思主义真正成为自己的完整的世界观。（摘自1957年学习半月刊第二十二期胡绳“争取无产阶级世界观的彻底胜利”）
