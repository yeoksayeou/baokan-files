    Celebrating the October Revolution Festival with the People of the Capital
    Soviet Representatives Go Deep into Factories and Schools
    The Soviet delegation from all walks of life, participating in the Chinese people's celebration of the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution, went to factories and schools in three groups on the 8th to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution together with the workers and university students of the capital.
    Head of the delegation, Comrade Andreyev, and delegation members Andreyeva, Muradeli, Novgorodsky, and Kislenko, accompanied by Comrade Gao Yangwen, Vice Minister of Metallurgical Industry, and Comrade Liu Ren, Second Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the CPC, attended the celebration meeting held at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, and were warmly welcomed by the three thousand employees attending the meeting.
    Comrade Andreyev and Comrades Andreyeva and Muradeli spoke at the meeting, conveying the fraternal friendship and respect of the Soviet people to the Chinese people. Comrade Andreyev's speech talked about the great significance of the October Revolution, the construction achievements of the Soviet Union, the unity of socialist countries, and the great friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people. He said that the Soviet Union once fought alone to repel foreign attacks and build a poor and backward country into a rich and prosperous one, but the Soviet Union is no longer alone now, because there are now thirteen countries that have become socialist countries, and the Soviet Union lives in a big socialist family. The Soviet people are particularly happy about the construction achievements of the Chinese people, and the Soviet Union will use all means to help the Chinese people carry out socialist construction in the past, present and future.
    Muradeli, the composer of "Moscow-Beijing", announced at the meeting that seven years ago, in order to commemorate Chairman Mao Zedong's visit to the Soviet Union, he wrote the song "Moscow-Beijing" praising the friendship between China and the Soviet Union. This time, he came to China for the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution, and he will definitely write a new song praising the friendship between China and the Soviet Union in China. The speeches of the distinguished guests repeatedly aroused stormy and warm applause at the meeting.
    Zhang Ping, Secretary of the CPC Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant Committee, spoke at the beginning of the meeting, warmly welcoming the Soviet delegation from all walks of life to participate in this celebration meeting. He thanked the more than 30 Soviet experts sent by the Soviet Union who had come to the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant one after another to help them repair and build new factory equipment, establish a scientific management system, and impart the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. Wang Cai, the leader of the youth blast furnace, presented samples of pig iron and cast pipes produced by the factory, as well as a photo of the night scene of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, to the Soviet guests as souvenirs on behalf of the employees.
    Before attending the celebration meeting, Comrade Andreyev and the delegation members had a cordial conversation with the factory's负责人 to understand the factory's production situation. After the meeting, they also visited the youth blast furnace and the No. 2 coking furnace.
    Comrade Cherednichenko, Volkova, and Yerofeyev, members of the Soviet delegation from all walks of life, came to the state-owned Beijing No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory amidst the workers' warm welcome, and spoke at the celebration meeting held at this factory with the participation of 1,500 people. Volkova, a famous Soviet textile worker, brought the deep friendship of the Soviet textile workers to the Chinese textile workers. She said that our two countries' textile workers are determined to contribute all their strength to defending world peace, determined to dress our working people more beautifully, and build our great country more prosperous and strong. Volkova's enthusiastic words aroused a long and warm applause.
    Zhang Xingdi, a female weaver and advanced producer of this factory, said in her speech that they must strive to learn from the spirit of selfless labor, overcoming difficulties, and building the country diligently and thriftily of the Soviet working people, and contribute all their strength to building the socialist motherland. Song Ting, the director of the factory, gave the fine yarn produced by the factory as a gift to the Soviet guests. The male and female workers of the factory performed Soviet folk dances and songs for the Soviet guests, as well as a repertoire of Chinese folk instrumental music.
    After the celebration meeting, the Soviet guests visited the factory's various production workshops and other welfare facilities. Volkova received a particularly warm welcome from the Chinese female workers in every workshop. This Soviet Stakhanovite worker also gave many valuable suggestions to the Chinese female weavers during her visit to the weaving workshop. She also took a group photo with Yu Shulan, an advanced producer of this factory, in front of a Chinese-made automated loom.
    This afternoon, three thousand teachers and students of Tsinghua University warmly received Comrade Umarov, Bulkina, and Kozlovsky, members of the Soviet delegation from all walks of life. Jiang Nanxiang, President of Tsinghua University, spoke at the celebration meeting of the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution to welcome the distinguished guests, and asked them to bring the hearts of more than 13,000 teachers, students and staff of Tsinghua University to the great Soviet people. A student representative presented the relay baton of the symbolic "Beijing-Moscow" long-distance running to the distinguished guests at the meeting. In this symbolic long-distance running held to celebrate the October Revolution Festival, more than 8,000 students ran a total of 79,000 kilometers in five days.
    All three distinguished guests spoke at the meeting, wishing the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people would last forever. Umarov, President of the Tajik Republic Academy of Sciences, said to the young people, you live in the beautiful Tsinghua Garden, but the young people themselves are more beautiful than Tsinghua Garden, because you are the builders of the socialist cause of new China. After finishing his speech, he presented a statue of Lenin to the school as a souvenir. Old Bolshevik, participant in the domestic war, Associate Professor Bulkina of Moscow First Medical College, and Kozlovsky, Secretary of the Kuibyshev Oblast Committee of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League, all spoke, congratulating the Chinese youth on their great achievements in study and work.
