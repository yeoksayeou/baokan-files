"Less Butter, More Guns!"
By a Commentator of This Newspaper

The U.S. ruling clique is becoming increasingly blatant in its attempts to exploit the Soviet Union's launch of the artificial Earth satellite, a scientific achievement hailed by peace-loving humanity, to stir up a frenzied arms race. Less than a week after U.S. President Eisenhower delivered his so-called "Science in National Security" speech on November 7, which put forward an action program for a high-speed arms race, he delivered another speech on "National Security" on November 13, demanding that the American people tighten their belts to realize a comprehensive plan to expand armaments.

In his speech, Eisenhower, in addition to repeating the worn-out tune that the Soviet Union's Earth satellite threatens the security of the "free world," mainly demanded that the American people make sacrifices and contribute money. Although, according to the U.S. President's own figures, the United States currently spends more than $42 billion annually on military expenditures, he believes that new funding "reaching a substantial figure" must be added.

What is this new funding for? The U.S. President presented a wide-ranging list: he wants to spend money on "inventing, manufacturing, and testing more advanced weapons for future use"; to build more bombers and submarines; to strengthen the Strategic Air Command; to add extra Strategic Air Command bases; to have more runways, more refueling stations, and more aircraft hangars; to improve the so-called warning network; to improve the production, distribution, and deployment of missiles; to raise the salaries of soldiers to attract more American youth to regard the military as a career; and finally, he also wants to carry out a satellite program, but he hastily stated that this is not only for scientific purposes but also combined with "basic defense requirements." In other words, the satellite planned by the United States is stained with a strong bloody scent.

This is a plan for a comprehensive expansion of armaments and an intensification of international tensions. This is a serious challenge to all peace-loving people who advocate arms reduction and the easing of international tensions.

The U.S. ruling clique has proven by its own actions that its previously shameless propaganda of so-called "sincerity" on the issue of disarmament is complete nonsense. Now, people can see very clearly that in addition to resolutely refusing to ban atomic weapons and nuclear weapons, the U.S. ruling clique is also completely insincere in reducing troops and conventional armaments.

The U.S. President's proposal of this latest plan to expand armaments at a time when the U.S. economy is trending towards depression is clearly not a coincidence. Since this spring, U.S. production has been declining, many industrial sectors are mired in overproduction, and the phenomenon of business shutdowns is becoming increasingly serious. In the steel sector, for example, current operating capacity is only 80% of what it was last autumn. The contraction of production has expanded unemployment; in September of this year, the number of workers in American enterprises was 300,000 fewer than in December of last year. American bourgeois economists are already clamoring for the need to stop this downward trend, and the U.S. ruling clique can obviously only use the expansion of military spending to stimulate production and guarantee maximum profits for monopoly capitalists. The surge in the stock prices of military-related companies on the New York stock market after Eisenhower's speech is a powerful proof of this.

In order to carry out arms expansion and war preparations and guarantee the excessive profits of American billionaires, U.S. Secretary of Commerce Weeks publicly demanded on the same day that Eisenhower delivered his speech: "Less butter, more guns." This slogan, put forward by Hitler's propaganda minister Goebbels in those years, has now reappeared in the United States. However, the world situation that once allowed Hitler to dominate is gone forever. The will of the people of all countries to demand peace is becoming stronger and stronger, and the U.S. ruling clique's plan to expand armaments and prepare for war is bound to encounter strong opposition and fall into failure in the face of powerful forces for peace.

    “少些牛油，多些大炮！”
    本报评论员
    美国统治集团别有用心地利用苏联发射人造地球卫星这样一件为和平人类所欢呼的科学创举，大叫大嚷，以便煽起疯狂的军备竞赛的做法是越来越明显了。美国总统艾森豪威尔于本月7日发表了所谓“国家安全中的科学问题”的演说，提出了一个高速度进行军备竞赛的行动纲领之后，不到一个星期，又于13日发表了“论国家安全”的演说，要求美国人民勒紧裤带，来实现全面扩张军备的计划。
    艾森豪威尔在他的这篇演说中，除了重复所谓苏联的地球卫星威胁“自由世界”的安全这一滥调之外，主要地就是要求美国人民作出牺牲，拿出钱来。虽然根据美国总统自己所提出的数字，美国目前每年花费的军事开支已达四百二十亿美元以上，但是他认为还必须增加“将达到很大的数字”的新经费。
    要这些新经费干什么呢？美国总统开出了广泛的单子：他要把钱花在“发明、制造和试验供将来使用的更加先进的武器这一方面”；要制造更多的轰炸机和潜水艇；要加强战略空军；要增加额外的战略空军基地；要更多的飞机跑道，更多的加油站和更多的飞机库；要改进所谓警报网；要改善导弹的生产、分布和装置；要提高军人的饷银以吸引更多的美国青年把军队当作职业；最后，他也要进行卫星计划，但是他急忙声明这不仅是为了科学目的，而是同“防务上的基本要求”相结合的。换句话说，美国计划中的卫星是带着浓厚的血腥气的。
    这是一个全面扩张军备、加剧国际紧张局势的计划。这对一切主张裁减军备、缓和国际紧张局势的爱好和平的人民，是一个严重的挑战。
    美国统治集团用自己的行动证明了它以往恬不知耻地宣传的所谓在裁军问题上的“诚意”完全是胡说。现在，人们可以看得很清楚，美国统治集团除了坚决拒绝禁止原子武器和核武器外，它在裁减军队和常规军备这一方面也是毫无诚意的。
    美国总统提出这一最新的扩张军备计划，正是美国经济趋于萧条的时候，这显然不是一种偶合。美国自今春以来生产一直趋于下降，许多工业部门陷于生产过剩，企业停工的现象也日益严重。以钢铁部门来说，目前的开工能力只有去年秋天的80％。生产紧缩扩大了失业现象，今年9月份美国企业的工人人数比去年12月份减少三十万人。美国资产阶级经济学家已经在惊呼必须制止这种下降趋向，而美国统治集团显然又只能用扩充军事开支来刺激生产，为垄断资本家保证最大限度的利润。艾森豪威尔演说后，纽约股票市场中同军事有关的企业的股票猛涨就是有力的证明。
    为了进行扩军备战和保证美国亿万富翁的超额利润，美国商务部长威克斯在艾森豪威尔发表演说的同一天公开要求：“少些牛油，多些大炮”。当年希特勒的宣传部长戈培尔所提出的这一口号，现在又在美国出现了。但是，当年可以容许希特勒叱咤一时的世界局势已经一去不复返了。各国人民要求和平的意志越来越坚强了，美国统治集团扩军备战的计划必然要遭到强烈的反对，并在强大的和平力量面前陷于失败。
