Xinhua News Agency, November 17th: The 84th meeting of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress has principally approved the "Regulations of the State Council on Improving the Financial Management System." This regulation has been issued by the State Council's order on November 15, 1957, and is scheduled to be implemented on a trial basis starting in 1958. This is a major improvement in China's financial management system. The main contents of the improvement are to clearly define the scope of revenue and expenditure of local finance, appropriately expand the authority of local governments to manage finance, and increase the local financial resources under the premise of ensuring key national construction projects, so as to further promote the enthusiasm of various localities in accumulating funds, increasing revenue, and saving expenditure, and promote the development of construction undertakings. The main points of this regulation are as follows:

　　(1) Local financial revenue is generally divided into three types: The first type is local fixed revenue, including the income of local original enterprises, local business income, seven types of local taxes (stamp tax, interest income tax, slaughter tax, livestock transaction tax, urban real estate tax, cultural and entertainment tax, vehicle and vessel usage license tax) and other miscellaneous local income, all of which are allocated to the local governments. The second type is enterprise profit-sharing revenue, including enterprises newly delegated by the central government and enterprises that have not been delegated but in which local governments participate in profit-sharing. The profits of these enterprises are uniformly allocated to the provinces and cities where they are located at a rate of 20% as local revenue. The third type is adjustment profit-sharing revenue, including commodity circulation tax, goods tax, business tax, income tax, agricultural tax, and public debt income. The proportion of these revenues allocated to local governments is calculated and determined separately according to the needs of each locality to balance revenue and expenditure.

　　(2) Local financial expenditure is generally divided into two types: The first type is local normal expenditure, including local economic construction expenses, social, cultural, and educational expenses, administrative expenses, and other local expenditures. These expenditures are balanced by the local governments using the allocated revenue. The second type is expenditure solved by special appropriations from the central government, including basic construction expenditure and special expenditure (such as major disaster relief funds, large-scale immigration and land reclamation expenditure planned by the state, etc.). Some of these expenditures need to be arranged uniformly by the central government among regions, and some are temporary and special expenses, so the central government will allocate funds separately each year to solve them.

　　(3) The items of revenue and the proportion of profit-sharing are divided according to the needs of normal expenditure. If the local governments can meet the needs of normal expenditure with fixed revenue, no other revenue will be allocated, and the surplus will be turned over to the central government at a certain proportion. If the local governments cannot meet the needs of normal expenditure with fixed revenue, enterprise profit-sharing revenue will be allocated. If the local governments can meet the needs of normal expenditure with fixed revenue plus enterprise profit-sharing revenue, no adjustment profit-sharing revenue will be allocated, and the surplus will be turned over to the central government at a certain proportion. If the local governments still have insufficient funds even if both fixed revenue and enterprise profit-sharing revenue are allocated, adjustment profit-sharing revenue will be allocated. The proportion of adjustment profit-sharing revenue is determined according to the amount of the shortfall (for example, if a province's normal expenditure is still 20 million yuan short after receiving fixed revenue and enterprise profit-sharing revenue, and the province's total adjustment profit-sharing revenue is 200 million yuan, then the local government's share of adjustment profit-sharing should be 10%). If all three types of revenue are allocated to the local governments and there is still a shortfall, the central government will provide subsidies. After the items of local revenue and the proportion of profit-sharing are determined as above, they will remain unchanged in principle for three years, except in special circumstances where adjustments are necessary.

　　(4) Local surplus and local surcharges. In the future, local governments can arrange expenditure according to revenue within the defined scope. If revenue exceeds expenditure in the process of budget implementation, the local governments can arrange to use it on their own. The year-end surplus of the local budget will be retained entirely by the local governments and arranged for use in the next year. The local industrial and commercial tax surcharge will be changed to 1% of the total amount of the four taxes: commodity circulation tax, goods tax, business tax, and income tax. Local industrial and commercial tax surcharges, agricultural tax surcharges, and urban public utilities surcharges shall be managed separately by the local governments and not included in the budget.

　　(5) The finances of ethnic autonomous areas receive more consideration than those of general provinces and cities. For ethnic autonomous regions, all local fixed revenue, enterprise profit-sharing revenue, and adjustment revenue will be allocated as local revenue. The surplus will be turned over to the central government, and the shortfall will be subsidized by the central government. Appropriate consideration is also given to ethnic autonomous prefectures and autonomous counties.

    Because everyone lacks experience with the improved financial system, the regulations state that if any inappropriate points are found after one year of trial implementation, local adjustments can be made according to the situation.

### 国务院公布关于改进财政管理体制的规定

    国务院公布关于改进财政管理体制的规定
    新华社17日讯　全国人民代表大会常务委员会第八十四次会议原则批准了“国务院关于改进财政管理体制的规定”，这个规定已由国务院于1957年11月15日命令发布，确定自1958年起开始试行。这是我国财政管理制度上的一项重大改进。改进的主要内容，是明确划定地方财政的收支范围，适当地扩大地方管理财政的权限，并且在保证国家重点建设的前提下增加地方的机动财力，从而进一步发挥各地方积累资金、增加收入、节约支出的积极性，推动建设事业的发展。这个规定的要点如下：
      （一）地方财政收入，一般分为三种：第一种是地方固定收入，包括地方原有企业的收入，地方事业收入，七种地方税收（印花税、利息所得税、屠宰税、牲畜交易税、城市房地产税、文化娱乐税、车船使用牌照税）和地方其他零星收入，这些收入全部划给地方。第二种是企业分成收入，包括中央新下放企业和虽未下放但地方参与分成的企业，这些企业的利润一律按20％的比例划给所在省市，作为地方收入。第三种是调剂分成收入，包括商品流通税、货物税、营业税、所得税、农业税和公债收入，这些收入划给地方的比例，按照各个地方平衡收支的需要，分别计算确定。
      （二）地方财政的支出，一般分为两种：第一种是地方的正常支出，包括地方经济建设事业费、社会文教事业费、行政经费和其他地方性支出。这些支出由地方用划定的收入，自求平衡。第二种是由中央专案拨款解决的支出，包括基本建设支出和特殊性支出（如重大灾荒救济费、国家计划的大规模移民垦荒支出等）。这些支出有的需要由中央在地区之间作统一的安排，有的是临时的特殊性的开支，因此每年由中央另行拨款解决。
      （三）按照正常支出的需要，划分收入的项目和分成的比例。地方用固定收入能够满足正常支出需要的，不再划给其他收入，多余的部分按照一定的比例上缴中央。地方用固定收入不能满足正常支出需要的，划给企业分成收入。地方用固定收入加上企业分成收入能够满足正常支出需要的，不再划给调剂分成收入，多余的部分按照一定的比例上缴中央。地方的固定收入和企业分成收入两种收入都划给地方仍然不足的，再划给调剂分成收入。调剂分成收入的分成比例，按照不足部分的多少来确定（例如某省划给固定收入和企业分成收入后，正常支出仍不足两千万元，该省全部调剂分成收入为两亿元，则地方应得的调剂分成比例为10％）。如果三种收入全部划给地方仍然不足，由中央拨款补助。以上地方收入的项目和分成的比例确定以后，除了遇有特殊情况须要加以调整以外，原则上三年不变。
      （四）地方结余和地方附加。今后，地方可以在划定的范围内，根据收入，安排支出。地方预算在执行过程中，收入超过支出，地方可以自行安排使用。地方预算的年终结余，全部留给地方，由地方在下年度安排使用。地方工商税附加改为按商品流通税、货物税、营业税、所得税等四种税收总额的1％征收。地方工商税附加、农业税附加、城市公用事业附加，一律由地方另行管理，不列入预算。
      （五）民族自治地方的财政，比一般省市有较多的照顾。对民族自治区，将地方固定收入、企业分成收入和调剂全部收入都划作地方收入。多余的部分上缴中央，不足的部分由中央补助。对于民族自治州、自治县，也给予了适当的照顾。
    由于大家对改进后的财政体制还缺乏经验，规定中说明，在试行一年以后，如果发现有不适当的地方，可以再根据情况作局部的调整。
