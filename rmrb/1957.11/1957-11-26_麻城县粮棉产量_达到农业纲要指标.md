    Macheng County Grain and Cotton Yields
    Reach Agricultural Program Targets
    (Xinhua News Agency) Macheng County, an old revolutionary base area in the Dabie Mountains, has achieved per-mu average yields of grain and cotton that meet the highest targets set by the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) ten years ahead of schedule.
    This year, Macheng County's 680,000 mu of grain fields yielded an average of over 800 jin of grain per mu, and its 130,000 mu of double-crop cotton and wheat fields yielded an average of 103 jin of ginned cotton and 300 jin of wheat per mu. The yields of oil crops, silkworm cocoons, tea, and other products have also increased significantly compared to last year.
    Macheng County, Hubei Province, is located on the southern slope of the Dabie Mountains. More than two-thirds of the county's cultivated land is in mountainous and hilly areas. Except for the relatively good soil quality of the cultivated land in the plains, the rest of the cultivated land is mostly clay and gravelly soil. Water and fertilizer resources are not as abundant as in the plain areas along the rivers and coasts, and other natural conditions are not superior to other places; on the contrary, in recent years, Macheng County has been threatened by continuous spring rains and severe autumn droughts. Before liberation, the average annual grain yield of the county was only about 400 jin per mu; the annual cotton yield was only more than 30 jin per mu in the plains and only a dozen jin in the hilly and mountainous areas. After liberation, under the leadership of the Party and the government, grain and cotton yields increased significantly, but in 1956 the average annual grain yield was only more than 580 jin per mu, and cotton was only 60 jin.
    In grain production, Macheng County implemented "five changes" -- changing single-season rice to double-season rice, indica rice to japonica rice, low-yield crops to high-yield crops, dry land to paddy fields, and old-fashioned farm implements to new and improved farm implements. It also adopted key yield-increasing measures such as close planting and timely and appropriate application of top dressing fertilizer in stages. This year, merely by changing 30,000 mu of single-season rice fields to double-season rice and 230,000 mu of indica rice fields to japonica rice, the county increased grain production by more than 40 million jin. In cotton production, Macheng County planted cotton in wheat fields. This year, agricultural cooperatives resolved the contradiction between cotton and wheat production in terms of cultivation, sowing, weeding, thinning, harvesting, and labor arrangements. They conscientiously implemented yield-increasing technical measures such as deep plowing, close planting, and timely pruning, and organized special personnel to continuously prevent and control pests, so that cotton and wheat generally achieved bumper harvests. In addition, agricultural cooperatives improved the soil of 50,000 to 60,000 mu of land by mixing clay soil with sandy soil and sandy soil with clay soil.

    麻城县粮棉产量
    达到农业纲要指标
    据新华社讯大别山革命老根据地麻城县今年粮食和棉花的每亩平均产量，都提前十年达到了全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）规定的最高指标。
    今年麻城县的六十八万亩粮田平均每亩收获粮食八百斤以上，十三万亩棉麦两熟田平均每亩收获皮棉一百零三斤和小麦三百斤。油料作物和蚕丝、茶叶等产量，也比去年有很大增加。
    湖北省麻城县位于大别山南麓，全县有三分之二以上的耕地在山区和丘陵地带，除平原耕地的土质较好外，其余的耕地多是粘泥土和沙砾土。水源、肥源不如沿江沿海的平原地区充裕，其它自然条件也不比别的地方优越；相反，最近几年来，麻城县连年都遭受了连绵春雨和秋季大旱的威胁。解放前，全县的粮食平均每亩年产量仅有四百斤左右；棉花在平原地区每亩年产三十多斤，在丘陵山区不过十几斤；解放后，在党和政府的领导下粮棉产量有很大增加，但是1956年的粮食平均每亩年产量也只有五百八十多斤，棉花只有六十斤。
    麻城县在粮食生产方面，实行了“五改”——单季稻改双季稻、籼稻改粳稻，低产作物改高产作物、旱田改水田、旧式农具改新式改良农具，还采取了密植、适时适量地分期追肥等关键性的增产措施，今年仅把三万亩单季稻田改种双季稻，把二十三万亩籼稻田改种粳稻，就增产粮食四千多万斤。在棉花方面，麻城县都是在麦田里种棉花，今年各农业社从耕作、播种、薅草、间苗、收割、劳力安排等方面解决棉麦生产的矛盾，认真执行了深耕、密植、适时整枝打杈等增产技术措施和组织专人不断防治虫害，使棉麦普遍获得了丰收。另外，各农业社用泥田掺沙、沙田掺土的办法，改良了五、六万亩田的土壤。
