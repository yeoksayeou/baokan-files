Xinhua News Agency, November 24th: According to TASS, the third meeting of the Academic Committee of the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research concluded on the 23rd in Dubna, near Moscow.

    At the closing meeting, the committee heard a report on the scientific research work of the Institute's Nuclear Problem Laboratory. Vlyakin and Neganov, representing the staff of this laboratory, reported on the results of high-energy nuclear reaction research. Romanian physicist Petrashku gave a report on the distribution of Ц mesons and electrons and their fission time. Kolenchenko reported on some aspects of the experimental study of the elastic and inelastic interaction of Л mesons with hydrogen.

    In view of the strengthening of research work, the members of the Academic Committee unanimously advocated expanding various construction projects of the Institute.

    In his closing remarks, Professor Blokhintsev, Director of the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research, pointed out that the meetings were conducted with full mutual understanding. He said that the high level of enthusiasm of the members of the Academic Committee showed that the cooperation of scientists from friendly countries in solving the problems of nuclear physics, which are of great significance to mankind, has been fruitful.

    At the meeting on the 22nd, Professor Danesh (Poland), Deputy Director of the Institute, reported on the Institute's international relations. He said that the Institute's staff participated in eight academic conferences and meetings in the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, Hungary, Austria, Italy, and Poland. The Institute is exchanging information with its member states and many scientific centers in the United Kingdom, the United States, India, Japan, and other countries. The academic works of the Institute's staff have been distributed to more than one hundred locations.

    Professor Votruba (Czechoslovakia), Deputy Director of the Institute, gave a report on the work of scientists from the Institute's member states at the Institute. The report pointed out that their number has doubled in the last six months and will continue to increase next year.

    At the evening meeting, Academician Bogolyubov introduced the contents of his forthcoming academic work "Theory of Superconductivity". Physics and Mathematics Associate Doctor Tolstov reported on the first results of experiments conducted on the synchrophasotron at the High Energy Laboratory. Wang Shufen (China) and Markov (Bulgaria) also participated in this work. The experimental results will be published soon.

    The Academic Committee approved the work plan of each laboratory for 1958. (Attached picture)

    联合原子核研究所会议胜利闭幕
    学术委员会委员一致主张扩大各项工程建筑计划
    新华社24日讯　据塔斯社讯：联合原子核研究所学术委员会第三次会议23日在莫斯科近郊的杜布诺闭幕。
    在闭幕会议上，委员会听取了关于研究所原子核问题实验室科学研究工作的报告。弗利亚金和涅加诺夫代表这个实验室的工作人员报告了高能量核反应研究结果。罗马尼亚物理学家彼得拉什库做了Ц介子和电子的分布情况及其裂变时间的报告。科连钦科报告了实验性研究Л介子同氢的弹性和非弹性相互作用的一些情况。
    鉴于研究工作的加强，学术委员会委员一致主张扩大研究所各项工程建筑计划。
    联合原子核研究所所长勃洛欣采夫教授在致闭幕词时指出，各次会议都是在相互充分谅解的情况下进行的。他说，学术委员会委员们高度的积极性表明，各友好国家的科学家为解决对人类具有重大意义的原子核物理学问题而进行的合作是有成绩的。
    在22日的会议上，研究所副所长丹涅什（波兰）教授在会上报告了这个研究所在国际联系方面的情况。他说，研究所工作人员在苏联、南斯拉夫、匈牙利、奥地利、意大利和波兰参加了八次学术大会和会议。研究所正在同自己的成员国以及英国、美国、印度、日本和其他国家的很多科学中心交换情报。研究所工作人员的学术著作已经分发到一百多处。
    研究所副所长沃特鲁巴（捷克斯洛伐克）教授做了关于研究所成员国科学家们在研究所的工作情况的报告。报告指出，最近六个月，他们的人数增加了一倍，明年还将继续增加。
    在晚间会议上，波戈留波夫院士介绍了他要发表的学术著作“超导性论”的内容。物理学—数学副博士托尔斯托夫报告了在高能量实验室同步稳相加速器上进行的实验的第一批结果。参加这个工作的还有王树芬（中国）和马尔科夫（保加利亚）。实验结果不久即可发表。
    学术委员会批准了各实验室1958年的工作计划。（附图片）
