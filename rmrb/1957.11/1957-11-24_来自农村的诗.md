Poems from the Countryside

    The New Member
    Zhang Xiangtao

    The county head came to our village,
    He wants to register and become a member of the commune,
    In the morning, he set up a stove in the village,
    In the afternoon, he went to the fields to work.
    The county head was originally a peasant,
    He has been doing revolution for twenty years,
    Now he goes up the mountain to be a farmer,
    Plowing the south depression with a whip.
    Giddy up, giddy up,
    Sweating profusely,
    Clothes soaked.
    The commune members said:
    "County head, take a break,
    Catch your breath and have a smoke."
    The county head smiled,
    And still swung the whip:
    "Don't call me county head anymore,
    I am a member of our commune."
        (Hebei Tangshan)

    Ah, the Commune, You Will Not Collapse
    Niu Baotong
    
    The advanced commune!
    The rich peasant venomously curses: "The commune will collapse"…
    Let him curse himself!
    The commune will not collapse,
    Just as the blue sky will not fall!
    Niu Baotong from Song Village heard the county head was leaving,
    Men and women, young and old, saw him off at the village entrance.
    The old man grabbed the county head's hand,
    And opened his mouth in front of his daughter:
    "County head, county head, don't leave,
    After the autumn harvest, have a drink with us!"
        Autumn, 1957.

    新来的社员
    张响涛
    县长来到我庄上，
    他要立户当社员，
    前晌到庄安锅灶，
    后晌下地干。
    县长原是庄稼汉，
    革命干了二十年，
    而今上山当农民，
    南洼犁地甩大鞭。
    嘚儿哦喝，嘚儿哦喝，
    满头大汗，
    湿透衣衫。
    社员说：
    “县长啊，歇一会，
    喘喘气儿抽袋烟。”
    县长笑嘿嘿，
    还是抡大鞭：
    “往后不要叫县长，
    我是咱社一社员。”
        （河北唐山）
    社啊，你不会垮	牛宝童
    高级社啊！
    富农在毒恶的诅咒：“社要垮”……
    让他咒骂他自己吧！
    社不垮，
    正如青天不会坍！
    送村头牛宝童听说县长走，
    男女老少送村头。
    老汉拉住县长手，
    当着闺女开了口：
    “县长县长您别走，
    秋后丰收喝杯酒！”
        1957年，秋天。
