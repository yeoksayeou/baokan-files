Unveiling the Curtain of the Chemical World
    -- A Visit to the Comprehensive Chemical Industry Exhibition
    By Fan Rongkang, Staff Reporter

    Poetry, Riddles, and Magic
    It's as strong as metal, yet as light as bamboo; it's as transparent as glass, yet not as easily broken; it's as thin as paper, yet as tough and elastic as leather.

    This is not poetry, nor is it a riddle; yet it takes people to a realm as beautiful as poetry and as mysterious as a riddle. What is it that simultaneously possesses such diverse and excellent properties? It is plastic, a type of chemical product.

    Plastics have extremely wide applications in the national economy; they possess almost limitless capabilities, like a "thousand-handed Buddha." Plastics can replace wood, ferrous metals, non-ferrous metals, and even leather. Plastics can be used to manufacture parts for airplanes and tanks, bodies, transmissions, and steering wheels for automobiles, bearings and gears for machinery, insulating materials such as cables and switches, and many items for people's daily lives. Commonly known items like "chemical combs," "glass handbags," and "celluloid penholders" are all plastic products.

    Plastics, with such good performance and wide applications, what precious raw materials are they made of? You may not believe it, but plastics are made from some often unnoticed raw materials. For example, the main raw materials for polyvinyl chloride plastic are common coke, limestone, and salt.

    Coke, limestone, and salt, after chemical processing, are transformed into a completely different substance—plastic. This is truly a wonderful thing.

    The chemical industry is such a wonderful sector. Through the work of the chemical industry, useless materials can be transformed into useful materials, materials with limited uses can be transformed into materials with great uses, and materials with only certain uses can be transformed into materials with additional uses. Therefore, some people compare the chemical industry to a "magician." This comparison is not entirely accurate, of course. Magicians only use skillful techniques to deceive the audience's eyes, while the chemical industry can truly transform one substance into another.

    The Comprehensive Chemical Industry Exhibition, which opened in Beijing on November 20th, uses a large number of charts, models, and real objects to take us into a chemical world that is as beautiful as poetry, as mysterious as a riddle, and as magical as magic. Various chemical products, whose raw materials are unknown to outsiders, shine brightly. The entire exhibition, from the Comprehensive Pavilion to the Rubber Pavilion, unveils the curtain of the chemical world, allowing us to see how many chemical products are produced and what role they play in the national economy. It also allows us to see how the face of China's chemical industry has been changing in recent years.

          Eating, Clothing, and Other Matters

    The field of the chemical industry is extremely broad, and it has a significant impact on the development of various sectors of the national economy. A chart exhibited in the Comprehensive Pavilion shows that the products of the chemical industry supply all sectors of the national economy, including heavy industry, light industry, agriculture, national defense industry, and the construction industry. Some charts in the Basic Chemistry Pavilion further demonstrate how far-reaching this impact is.

    Not long ago, the CPC Central Committee announced the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) for 1956 to 1967, proposing that "both the central and local governments should actively develop the manufacturing industry of chemical fertilizers, striving to produce about five million to seven million tons of chemical fertilizers by 1962, and about fifteen million tons by 1967." This is an extremely impressive figure. This year, China's chemical fertilizer production is expected to reach only over 700,000 tons. To increase the production of chemical fertilizers to a level of approximately five million to seven million tons per year within five years, and then further increase it to approximately fifteen million tons within ten years, is truly a remarkable undertaking.

    Why is it necessary to develop the chemical fertilizer industry so quickly? Several charts in the Basic Chemistry Pavilion provide the most powerful explanation. One chart shows that one jin of nitrogen fertilizer can increase the yield of rice by three and a half jin or cotton by one jin; one jin of phosphate fertilizer can increase the yield of rice by one and a half jin or cotton by half a jin. During the first Five-Year Plan period, the chemical fertilizers produced domestically, when used in grain fields, could increase rice production by 17.6 billion jin, and when used in cotton fields, could increase cotton production by 50.7 million dan. Another chart makes a specific comparison of the economic effects of using chemical fertilizers and reclaiming wasteland. The same 2 billion yuan, used to develop the chemical fertilizer industry, can build twenty large and small chemical fertilizer plants, producing 4.5 million tons of chemical fertilizers annually; using these chemical fertilizers can increase grain production by 25.5 billion jin annually, which can feed 64 million people for a year. The same 2 billion yuan, used to reclaim wasteland, can only reclaim 28.57 million mu of wasteland, producing only 4.3 billion jin of grain annually, which can only feed 11 million people for a year.

    Near these two charts, there are samples of various chemical fertilizers on display. Among them are ammonium nitrate produced by the newly commissioned Jilin Fertilizer Plant, and granular superphosphate calcium, a new product of the Nanjing Phosphate Fertilizer Plant. The impression given by the various chemical fertilizers, after understanding their significant role in increasing agricultural production, is not just one of chemical fertilizer particles, but one of precious grains and cotton bolls. Eating and clothing are issues that everyone cares about, so it is no wonder that the audience shows great interest in the exhibits of chemical fertilizers.

    The synthetic fiber products exhibited in the Organic Chemistry Pavilion, although not numerous, attracted many viewers. "Nylon stockings" and the like are not unfamiliar to urban residents. The fabrics, shirts, and socks made of synthetic fibers exhibited at the exhibition are all foreign products; China cannot produce them yet. However, synthetic fiber samples trial-produced by several domestic units have appeared at the exhibition, giving the audience great encouragement. Synthetic fiber fabrics are not only more beautiful and durable than natural fiber fabrics, but more importantly, they provide another way to solve the people's clothing problem. In the near future, we will be able to produce synthetic fiber fabrics ourselves.

    Solving the problems of eating and clothing requires the development of the chemical industry; but the significance of developing the chemical industry is by no means limited to solving the problems of eating and clothing. All the exhibits displayed in the six exhibition halls illustrate the far-reaching impact of building the chemical industry on the development of the national economy, leaving a deep impression on people.

        Past, Present, and Future

    The exhibition focuses on introducing China's achievements in developing the chemical industry over the past eight years and the development trend of the chemical industry during the second Five-Year Plan period.

    The development speed of the chemical industry over the past eight years has been unprecedented. The Comprehensive Pavilion states that the output of major chemical products in 1956 was several times higher than the highest level before liberation, and the total output value of the chemical industry in 1957 is expected to be more than seventeen times that of 1949. The variety of chemical industry products, taking 1949 as 100, has increased to 481 in 1957. The Organic Chemistry Pavilion explains that before liberation, the production level of China's organic chemical industry was very low, and only imported raw materials were used to produce low-quality, low-quantity paints, dyes, and plastic products. Now, the variety of paints has increased from 16 to 212, the variety of dyes and intermediates has increased from 18 to 210, and high-quality aviation paints, bottom paints, ice-dyed dyes with excellent fastness, and important plastics such as plexiglass can all be produced domestically. The Pharmaceutical Pavilion states that before liberation, China's pharmaceutical industry mainly relied on imported raw materials to process into preparations and finished medicines. After liberation, the production of medicinal raw materials has gradually developed, and more than 180 kinds of medicinal raw materials have now been produced. The Rubber Pavilion states that China's rubber industry, which began in 1919 with the establishment of the first small handicraft factory in Guangzhou, has only 38 years of history. In the old China era, the rubber industry developed very slowly, and most rubber products were foreign goods. After liberation, the variety of rubber industry products has increased by more than three times, and the output of various products has also increased rapidly, basically meeting the needs, and some products can also be exported.

    Not only these sharply contrasting figures, but also some vivid exhibits, powerfully illustrate the development of China's chemical industry over the past eight years. Jinping Phosphorus Mine is a mine with more than 30 years of history, but it is small in scale and has simple equipment, with an annual output of only about 20,000 tons. During the Japanese occupation, the output even dropped to 10,000 tons. After liberation, Jinping Phosphorus Mine began a large-scale expansion project. The models of Jinping Phosphorus Mine and its production process displayed at the exhibition tell us that Jinping Phosphorus Mine is now a large-scale, modern enterprise with advanced equipment. The explainer said that after the completion of the entire reconstruction project of Jinping Phosphorus Mine, the annual output can be increased by 30 to 50 times compared with that before liberation. The models of Dalian Chemical Plant and other chemical enterprises and the model performances of new equipment in some chemical enterprises also illustrate that China's chemical industry has made great progress. A new product exhibited in the Rubber Pavilion—tubeless tires—attracted the attention of the audience. This type of tire reduces tire heat generation, can withstand high-speed driving, and can improve driving safety. If punctured by nails or other objects, it will not leak or leak slowly and can continue to be used. Several photos illustrate an interesting experiment that was conducted on tubeless tires: a nail with a diameter of three millimeters and a length of sixty millimeters was inserted into a tubeless tire, and the car with this tire installed still safely drove from the Summer Palace in Beijing to the Rubber Industry Research Institute in Tianjin. This shows that we have also made great progress in mastering the production technology of the chemical industry.

    The entire Comprehensive Chemical Industry Exhibition runs through this spirit: although the chemical industry has developed rapidly over the past eight years, it still cannot meet the needs of national economic development. The exhibition shows that the chemical industry will have greater development during the second Five-Year Plan period, a strong team of the chemical industry has grown up, and the clues of mineral resources such as phosphate rock, pyrite, and gypsum, reported by the masses for developing the chemical industry, are spread all over the country. Many important equipment for building chemical enterprises can now be produced domestically, and we also have the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries. China's chemical industry will surely become increasingly strong and play a greater role in the development of the national economy. (Attached picture)

    揭开化学世界的窗帘
    ——参观化学工业综合展览会
    本报记者　范荣康
    诗、谜语和魔术它像金属一样坚牢，却像竹子一样轻巧；它像玻璃一样透明，却不像玻璃一样容易破碎；它像纸张一样薄，却像牛皮一样坚韧，有弹性。
    这不是诗，也不是谜语；却把人带到像诗一样美好，像谜语一样奥妙的境地中去。是什么东西同时兼有如此多样的优异性能呢？这就是塑料，化学产品的一种。
    塑料在国民经济中的用途极其广泛，它几乎像“千手佛”一样具有无限的能耐。用塑料可以代替木材、也可以代替黑色金属和有色金属，还可以代替牛皮。用塑料可以制造飞机、坦克的零件，可以制造汽车的车身、变速器、方向盘，可以制造机械的轴承和齿轮，可以制造电缆、开关等绝缘器材，也可以制造人民日常生活中的许多用品。普通所说的“化学梳子”、“玻璃皮包”、“赛璐珞笔杆”等等，都是塑料制品。
    塑料，性能这么好，用途这么广，究竟是用什么宝贵的原料制成的呢？说来你也许不信，塑料是用一些不大被人注意的原料制成的。例如聚氯乙烯塑料的主要原料，就是常见的焦炭、石灰石和盐。
    焦炭、石灰石和盐，经过化学处理，竟变成完全不同的另一种物质——塑料，这是多么奇妙的事情。
    化学工业就是这样一个奇妙的工业部门。通过化学工业部门的工作，无用的物质可以变为有用的物质，用途不大的物质可以变为用途很大的物质，只有这几种用途的物质可以变为又有那几种用途的物质。因而有些人把化学工业譬喻为“魔术家”。这个譬喻当然也不十分恰当。魔术家只是利用熟练的技巧，瞒过了观众的眼睛，而化学工业却真能把一种物质变为另一种物质。
    11月20日在北京开幕的化学工业综合展览会，用大量的图表、模型和实物，把我们带到一个像诗一样美好、像谜语一样奥妙、像魔术一样神奇的化学世界中去，各式各样为外行人不知是用什么原料制成的化学产品大放异彩。从综合馆开始，到橡胶馆为止的全部展览会，揭开了化学世界的窗帘，让我们看到许多化学产品是怎样生产的，和它们在国民经济中有怎样的作用，也让我们看到，这些年来我国化学工业的面貌是在怎样地改变着。
          吃、穿和其他
    化学工业的领域极其广阔，它对国民经济各个部门的发展都有着重大的影响。综合馆展出的一幅图表表明，化学工业的产品，供应着包括重工业、轻工业、农业、国防工业、建筑工业在内的国民经济的各个部门；基本化学馆的一些图表更表明了这种影响有多么深远。
    不久以前，中共中央公布的1956年到1967年全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）中，提出“中央和地方都应当积极发展化学肥料的制造工业，争取到1962年生产化学肥料五百万吨到七百万吨左右，1967年生产一千五百万吨左右”。这是一个极为可观的数字。今年，我国化学肥料的产量预计还只能达到七十多万吨，要在五年的时间内，把化学肥料的产量提高到年产五百万吨到七百万吨左右的水平，并进而在十年内提高到一千五百万吨左右的水平，真是一件了不起的大事。
    为什么要这么快地发展化学肥料工业呢？基本化学馆的几张图表做了最有力的解释。一张图表表明：一斤氮肥可以增产稻谷三斤半或棉花一斤；一斤磷肥可以增产稻谷一斤半或棉花半斤。第一个五年计划期间，国内生产的化学肥料，用于粮田就可以增产稻谷一百七十六亿斤，用于棉田就可以增产棉花五千零七十万担。另一张图表对使用化学肥料和开垦荒地的经济效果作了具体的比较。同样二十亿元，用来发展化学肥料工业，可以建设大小二十个化学肥料厂，年产四百五十万吨化学肥料；用这些化学肥料每年可以增产粮食二百五十五亿斤，可供六千四百万人食用一年。同样二十亿元，用来开荒，只能开垦荒地二千八百五十七万亩，每年只能生产粮食四十三亿斤，只能供给一千一百万人食用一年。
    在这两张图表附近，陈列着各式各样化学肥料的样品。其中有新投入生产的吉林肥料厂出产的硝酸铵，有南京磷肥厂的新产品粒状过磷酸钙。各式各样的化学肥料，在明了了它对农业增产的重大作用之后，给人的印象已经不只是一颗一颗的化学肥料，而是一颗一颗宝贵的粮食和棉桃。吃饭穿衣是人人关心的问题，难怪观众在化学肥料的展览品面前表现出极大的兴趣。
    有机化学馆展出的合成纤维产品，虽然数量不多，却吸引了很多观众。“尼龙袜子”等等，对于城市人民说来，并不是什么很陌生的东西。展览会展出的用合成纤维织成的布匹、衬衣、袜子等都是外国的制品，我国目前还不能生产。但国内好几个单位试制的合成纤维样品，已出现在展览会上，给了观众很大的鼓舞。合成纤维的织物，不但比天然纤维的织物美观、耐用，而且更重要的是，它提供了另一条解决人民穿衣问题的出路。不久的将来，我们就可以自己生产合成纤维织物了。
    解决吃饭穿衣的问题都需要发展化学工业；但发展化学工业的意义决不只限于解决吃饭穿衣的问题。展览会的六个展览馆所陈列的全部展览品，都说明了建设化学工业对发展国民经济的深远的影响，给人们留下深刻的印象。
        过去，现在和将来
    展览会着重介绍了八年来我国发展化学工业的成就和第二个五年计划期间化学工业发展的趋势。
    这八年来，化学工业的发展速度是空前的。综合馆说明1956年主要化工产品的产量都数倍于解放前的最高水平，1957年化学工业的总产值预计为1949年的十七倍多。化学工业的品种，以1949年为一百，1957年已增为四百八十一。有机化学馆说明，解放前我国的有机化学工业生产水平很低，只使用进口原料生产质量低、数量少的油漆、染料和塑料产品。现在，油漆的品种已由十六种增为二百一十二种，染料和中间体的品种已由十八种增为二百一十种，质量要求较高的航空漆，船底漆，坚牢度优良的冰染染料和重要的塑料如有机玻璃，都能自己生产了。医药馆说明：解放前我国的医药工业主要是依靠进口原料加工成制剂和成药，解放后逐步发展了原料药的生产，现在已经生产的原料药共有一百八十多种。橡胶馆说明：我国橡胶工业从1919年在广州建立第一个小型手工业工厂开始，仅有三十八年历史，在旧中国时代橡胶工业发展很慢，大部分橡胶制品是外国货。解放后橡胶工业的品种增加了三倍多，各种产品的产量也增加很快。基本上满足了需要，同时还有某些产品可以出口。
    不仅是这些对比鲜明的数字，还有一些生动的展览品，对我国化学工业八年来的发展，作了有力的说明。锦屏磷矿是一个有三十多年历史的矿场，可是规模很小，设备简陋，年产量只两万吨左右，到日本侵占时期，产量更降为一万吨。解放后，锦屏磷矿开始了规模巨大的扩建工程，展览会陈列的锦屏磷矿的模型和生产过程的模型，告诉我们现在的锦屏磷矿已经是一个规模巨大，设备先进的现代化的企业了。解释员说，锦屏磷矿的全部改建工程完成后，年产量可以比解放前提高三十倍至五十倍。大连化学厂等化工企业的模型和一些化工企业的新设备的模型表演，也说明我国的化学工业已经有了很大的发展。橡胶馆陈列的一种新产品——无内胎轮胎，引起了观众的注意。这种轮胎减少了轮胎的发热性，经得起高速行驶，能够提高行驶的安全，如果被钉子和其他的东西刺破，不致泄气，或者泄气缓慢，能够继续使用。有几幅照片说明，曾经对无内胎轮胎进行过一种有趣的实验：把直径三公厘，长六十公厘的钉子扎入无内胎轮胎，安着这种轮胎的汽车，依然安全地从北京的颐和园驶到天津的橡胶工业研究所。这说明我们在掌握化学工业的生产技术上也有很大的提高。
    整个化学工业综合展览会贯串着这样一个精神：虽然八年来化学工业发展很快，但仍远远不能满足国民经济发展的需要。展览会表明，化学工业在第二个五年计划期间将有更大的发展，一支强大的化学工业的队伍已经成长起来，群众所报告的磷矿、黄铁矿、石膏矿等发展化学工业的矿产资源的线索，遍布大江南北，许多建设化工企业的重要设备国内已能生产，我们又有苏联和其他兄弟国家的无私援助，我国的化学工业必能日益强大，在国民经济的发展中发挥更大的作用。（附图片）
