Xinhua News Agency, November 11th:

    The Ministry of Water Resources and the Ministry of Agriculture jointly issued a notice on November 10th regarding the active implementation of winter irrigation and water storage and conservation work.
    The notice stated that winter irrigation is an effective measure to ensure increased wheat production and timely spring sowing. Since autumn this year, most parts of the country have experienced scarce rainfall, resulting in widespread drought, and the affected area is very large. Wheat sown after drought relief efforts generally lacks sufficient base moisture and needs winter and spring irrigation to strive for high wheat yields next year. The river flow in many areas has also been affected by the drought and is less than in previous years, which will inevitably lead to a tight water supply for spring irrigation next year, affecting timely spring sowing. In some southern regions, neglecting water storage and conservation often affects early rice planting. In view of the above situation, this winter and next spring's farmland irrigation and water storage and conservation work are particularly important and must be vigorously carried out.
    The notice requires water resources and agricultural departments at all levels to regard winter irrigation and water storage and conservation as an important measure for agricultural production, strengthen leadership, and make arrangements as early as possible. In northern provinces where winter wheat lacks sufficient base moisture, winter irrigation should be carried out universally. The storage and irrigation of water in winter fallow land should be completed before the spring wheat irrigation water is used. Southern provinces should repair ditches and cultivate soil, and do a good job in field drainage projects to protect wheat fields from waterlogging.
    The notice stated that on the basis of drought-resistant wheat planting, all possible water sources should continue to be utilized to strive for more irrigation. During winter irrigation, day and night rotation irrigation should also be implemented to improve water use efficiency.
    The notice requires all management agencies in irrigation areas and agricultural technology extension stations to list technical guidance for winter irrigation work as an important task. According to the local temperature and soil moisture content, strengthen specific guidance on irrigation time and irrigation volume to prevent improper irrigation from affecting the normal growth of wheat. Winter irrigation must be closely integrated with agricultural cultivation techniques.
    The notice also requires that water storage projects such as ponds, dams, and small reservoirs in southern regions should be thoroughly inspected in conjunction with winter and spring repairs. Repair leaks, improve maintenance systems, assign dedicated personnel to be responsible, and do a good job in water storage and conservation in a timely manner to ensure water for rice fields.

### 水利部农业部联合发出通知  做好冬灌  蓄水保水

    水利部农业部联合发出通知
    做好冬灌  蓄水保水
    新华社11日讯  水利部和农业部在10日联合发出了关于积极开展冬灌及储水保水工作的通知。
    通知说，冬灌是保证小麦增产和明春适时播种的有效措施。今年秋季以来，全国大部分地区雨量稀少，普遍出现干旱现象，受旱的面积很大。经过抗旱播种的小麦，一般底墒不足，需要进行冬春灌溉，以争取明年小麦的高额增产。许多地区河流水量亦受干旱影响，较往年为少，势必形成明年春灌的用水紧张状态，影响明春适时下种。南方有些地区也往往因疏于蓄水保水，影响早稻栽插。根据以上情况，今冬明春的农田灌溉及蓄水保水工作，就显得特别重要，必须大力开展。
    通知要求各级水利、农业部门应该把冬灌及蓄水保水工作，作为农业生产的一项重要措施，加强领导，及早安排。北方各省冬小麦底墒不足的，要普遍进行冬灌，对冬闲地的储水灌溉，要争取在小麦春灌用水以前一律浇完；南方各省应该修沟培土，做好田间排水工程，使麦田免受积水为害。
    通知说，在抗旱种麦的基础上，要继续把一切可能利用的水源都利用起来，争取多浇。在进行冬灌时还要做到日夜轮浇，以提高用水效率。
    通知要求所有灌区的管理机构和农业技术推广站，应该把冬灌工作的技术指导列为重要任务，根据各地气温及土壤含水情况，加强对灌水时间和灌水量的具体指导，防止由于灌溉不当而影响小麦正常生长。冬灌必须与农业耕作技术密切结合。
    通知还要求南方地区的塘坝、小水库等蓄水工程，应该结合冬春修进行一次全面检查。整修补漏，健全养护制度，专人负责，及时做好蓄水保水工作，以保证稻田用水。
