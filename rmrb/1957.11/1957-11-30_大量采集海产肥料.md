    Vigorously Collect Marine Fertilizers
    Our coastal areas and islands are rich in diverse marine fertilizers. In the coastal areas of Hepu and Zhanjiang Special Zones in Guangdong alone, farmers are accustomed to using marine fertilizers such as: fish broth, fish salt, snail shells, clam shells (burned ash), oyster shells, sea mud, crab shells, jellyfish, sand crabs, and seaweed. The results of using these fertilizers show that their fertilizing effect is no less than that of other fertilizers. For example, applying snail shell ash as a top dressing in rice paddies results in rice grains that are both firm and full. The fertilizing effect is even greater, and the harvests are better, when used for crops such as corn, sweet potatoes, potatoes, cassava, peanuts, and sesame. The fertilizers used in agricultural production on Weizhou Island and Xieyang Island, which belong to Beihai City in the Beibu Gulf, are mostly marine fertilizers, and the harvests of peanuts, corn, sweet potatoes, etc., grown in these places are generally very good.
    The yield of marine fertilizers is very large. According to incomplete statistics, the Beihai Aquatic Products Processing Plant alone supplied farmers with over 400,000 jin of fish residue and fish scales in the first quarter of 1955. In addition to the fish salt, fish scales, and fish broth left over from the fish curing process that can be used as fertilizer, there are also sea mud and marine plants such as seaweed that are washed up on the beaches by the tides and grow in shallow sea areas, which can be composted into green manure. These are produced year-round and are inexhaustible.
    If this abundant, remarkably effective marine fertilizer is systematically organized for production, processing, and supply, it will play a good role in ensuring increased agricultural production. However, it is a pity that these inexpensive and high-quality natural fertilizers have not yet been fully utilized. At present, the autumn fishing season has already begun in coastal areas, and the winter fishing season will follow one after another. This is the best season for collecting and processing marine fertilizers. It is hoped that the agricultural production departments and supply and marketing cooperatives in coastal areas will immediately take action to research and use marine fertilizers, and organize supplies in a planned manner. It is best to invest a small amount to build some small-scale fish fertilizer plants, so as to fully utilize the abundant marine fertilizer resources and serve agricultural production.

### 大量采集海产肥料

    大量采集海产肥料
    我国沿海一带和各岛屿，蕴藏着丰富的多种多样的海产肥料。仅广东的合浦和湛江专区沿海地区农民习惯使用的海产肥料就有：渔汁、渔盐、螺壳、蚬壳（烧灰）、蠔壳、海泥、蟹壳、海蜇、沙蟹、海茜等。使用的结果说明，这些海产肥料的肥效并不次于别的肥料。如在稻田里施上螺壳灰追肥，长出的谷粒既结实又饱满。而用于玉米、蕃薯、马铃薯、木薯、花生、芝麻等作物，肥效更大，收成亦好。北部湾北海市属涠洲岛和斜阳岛的农业生产上所使用的肥料，绝大部分是海产肥料，这些地方种植的花生、玉米、蕃薯等，收成一般都很好。
    海产肥料的产量是很大的。据不完全统计，仅北海水产加工厂1955年第一季供应农民的渔?渣、渔鳞就超过四十万斤。除了在腌制鱼类过程中余下来的渔盐、渔鳞、渔汁等可以做肥料以外，还有海泥和随着海潮涌到海滩上的以及浅海地方生长的海茜等海中植物，可以堆制绿肥。这些都是经年出产，取之不尽的。
    这种蕴藏丰富、肥效显著的海产肥料，如果有计划地组织生产、加工和供应，对于保证农业增产，将会起良好的作用。但是，现在这些价廉物美的自然肥料，还未有被充分地利用起来，实在可惜。目前，沿海地区的秋汛已经开始，冬汛渔季也将接连而来，这个时候正是采集、加工海产肥料最好的季节。希望沿海地区农业生产部门和供销合作社立即动手，进行海产肥料的研究使用，并有计划地组织供应。最好用少量投资兴建一些小型渔肥厂，以便充分利用丰富的海产肥料资料，为农业生产服务。
