Seriously Summarize the Experiences of the Patriotic Health Campaign Over the Past Few Years
By a commentator of this newspaper

The experience research conference on the patriotic health campaign and the elimination of the four pests held by the Ministry of Health has concluded. Although this conference was a small one, representatives from more than 30 typical grassroots units of the patriotic health campaign in 15 provinces and cities exchanged experiences at the meeting, creating favorable conditions for summarizing the national experience and further carrying out the patriotic health campaign centered on the elimination of the four pests.

The experiences shared by the representatives at the meeting included various regions, various aspects, and various enterprise and institutional systems, some were comprehensive experiences, and some were thematic experiences, with rich and diverse content. Experience proves that actively carrying out a regular patriotic health campaign is very necessary and entirely possible to improve the people's health and ensure the development of the socialist construction cause. The "National Agricultural Development Program" (revised draft) proposes that, starting from 1956, the four pests will be basically eliminated within twelve years, and diseases that are most harmful to the people will be eliminated wherever possible, which is entirely justified.

The experiences introduced by the representatives at the meeting are a great encouragement for doing a good job in the patriotic health campaign in the future. The outstanding achievements that the masses of Qile Township in Guangdong Province and Wulao Village in Nanjing City can create (see news) can also be created by the masses in other rural areas and cities; what the Wusi Agricultural Cooperative in Shaanxi and the Fushun Open-pit Coal Mine can do, other agricultural cooperatives and factories and mines can also do. If Nanjing East Road in Shanghai, a road with hundreds of thousands of people passing by every day, can be kept clean regularly, other city streets should also be able to do so. If the primary school students in Mishi Hutong in Beijing can persist in doing a good job in patriotic health work regularly, other primary school students can also do it, and middle school students and college students are even more capable of doing it well. With experience, with examples, and with methods, there is also confidence.

In order to further carry out the patriotic health campaign on a national scale, it is very necessary for various regions, various aspects, and various enterprise and institutional systems to conduct a summary of the experiences of the patriotic health campaign and the elimination of the four pests in the past few years.

According to the current situation, some people still have an insufficient understanding of the political significance of carrying out the patriotic health campaign. They mistakenly believe that health work is not the central work and oppose health work to production. They simply have not considered the issue of summarizing the experiences of the patriotic health campaign over the past few years. There are also some people who one-sidedly emphasize the difficulties in carrying out patriotic health work, believing that health work cannot be done well, and do not actively seek ways to overcome difficulties from summarizing experiences. These incorrect ideas, especially the existence of these ideas among leading comrades of some units, seriously hinder the development of the movement. Is health work related to the people's health and happiness really not an important job? Are the people's diseases and health not important matters? Are they not worthy of concern? Is it opposed to production? The experiences introduced by the representatives at the meeting gave a clear answer.

There are many difficulties in mobilizing the broad masses of people to change their living habits and do a good job in sanitation. Under the long-term rule of the exploiting classes, the broad masses of people are culturally backward and do not have the habit of paying attention to hygiene. Many people are still superstitious about ghosts and gods, and it is impossible to do a good job in sanitation in a very short period of time. However, health work is related to the vital interests of everyone and the construction of the country. As long as we carry out propaganda and mobilization repeatedly and in-depth, implement education on hygiene science knowledge, and enlighten the masses, the masses are happy to accept and actively participate. Difficulties can be overcome.

At present, all localities are carrying out the winter patriotic health campaign. To solve the above ideological problems and ensure the smooth progress of the summary work, it is necessary to implement the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the Party's Eighth Central Committee, and combine winter production, farmland water conservancy construction, and the winter manure accumulation movement to simultaneously carry out the deployment of various winter health tasks, conduct in-depth propaganda and mobilization, and further improve the broad masses of people's understanding of the significance of doing a good job in patriotic health work. Make the masses realize that the production movement, the manure accumulation movement, the mass cultural movement, and the mass health movement are a closely inseparable whole.

    认真总结几年来爱国卫生运动的经验
    本报评论员
    卫生部所召开的爱国卫生运动和除四害经验研究会议，已经结束了。这个会议虽然是一个小型的会议，但在会上，有来自十五个省市的三十多个基层爱国卫生运动典型单位的代表交流了经验，为总结全国的经验，进一步开展以除四害为中心的爱国卫生运动，创造了有利条件。
    代表们在会上交流的经验，包括各个地区、各个方面和各企业事业系统，有的是全面的经验，有的是专题经验，内容丰富多采。经验证明，积极的开展经常性的爱国卫生运动，对于提高人民的健康水平，保证社会主义建设事业的发展是非常必要的，也是完全有可能的。“全国农业发展纲要”（修正草案）中，提出从1956年算起，在十二年内基本上消灭四害，在一切可能的地方消灭危害人民最严重的疾病，这完全是有根据的。
    代表们在会上介绍的经验，对今后搞好爱国卫生运动是很大的鼓舞。广东省岐乐乡和南京市五老村群众能够创造出来的突出成绩（详见新闻），别的农村和城市的群众也有可能创造出来；陕西五四农业社、抚顺露天煤矿能够办得到的，别的农业社和厂矿也有可能办得到。上海市南京东路每天有上百万人过往的道路上，能做到经常保持清洁，别的城市街道也应该可以做到。北京市米市胡同小学生能坚持经常地做好爱国卫生工作，其它的小学生也能够做得到，而中学生、大学生们就更有条件把它做好。有了经验，有了榜样，有了办法，也就有了信心。
    为了在全国范围内进一步开展爱国卫生运动，各地区、各方面和各企业事业系统，很有必要把过去几年的爱国卫生运动和除四害的经验进行一次总结。
    根据目前的情况，还有些人对开展爱国卫生运动地政治意义认识不足，他们错误地认为卫生工作不是中心工作，把卫生工作和生产对立起来。他们根本没有考虑到总结几年来爱国卫生运动经验的问题。也有一些人，他们片面地强调在开展爱国卫生工作中的困难，认为卫生工作无法做好，也不积极的从总结经验中寻求克服困难的办法。这些不正确的思想，特别是有的单位领导同志存在这些思想，严重的妨害着运动的开展。有关人民健康和幸福的卫生工作当真不是重要的工作吗？人民的疾病和健康不是大事吗？不值得关心吗？它与生产是对立的吗？代表们在会上所介绍的经验，就给予清楚的回答。
    发动广大人民改变生活习惯做好卫生工作，是有很多困难的。广大人民在剥削阶级的长期统治下，文化落后，没有讲求卫生的习惯，有不少人还在迷信鬼神，要求在很短的时间内把卫生工作做好是不可能的。但是卫生工作关系到每个人的切身利益和国家的建设，只要反复深入地进行宣传动员，贯彻卫生科学知识的教育，启发群众的觉悟，群众是乐于接受和积极参加的。困难是可以克服的。
    目前，各地正在开展冬季爱国卫生运动。要解决以上的思想问题，保证总结工作的顺利进行，必须贯彻党的三中全会的精神，结合冬季生产，兴修农田水利，冬季积肥运动而同时进行对于冬季各项卫生工作的布置，进行深入的宣传动员，进一步提高广大人民对做好爱国卫生工作意义的认识。使群众认识到生产运动、积肥运动、群众的文化运动与群众的卫生运动是密切不可分离的整体的道理。
