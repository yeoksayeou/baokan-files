Xinhua News Agency, New York, November 23rd: TASS, New York, November 23rd: The Soviet delegation distributed a statement to the delegations of various countries attending the 12th session of the United Nations General Assembly on the 22nd, reiterating that the Soviet Union will not participate in the United Nations Disarmament Committee.

The statement condemned Western countries, primarily the United States, for being unwilling to reach a disarmament agreement and for insisting on the United Nations General Assembly to pass resolutions that cannot serve as the basis for stopping the arms race and eliminating the threat of atomic war, but will only lead to the failure of future disarmament negotiations. The statement said that the resolution on the members of the Disarmament Committee passed by the United Nations General Assembly under the pressure of the United States proves this point. According to this resolution, the vast majority of the members of the Disarmament Committee will be members of the Western military bloc, and this alone makes it impossible for disarmament negotiations to be effective. The United States and other Western countries are attempting to use the committee as a smokescreen to conceal their policy of preparing for atomic war.

The statement said that those who hastily pushed their disarmament resolutions through the United Nations General Assembly are now attempting to frame the issue as follows: that the Soviet Union's non-participation in the aforementioned Disarmament Committee is merely a pretense, and that if pressure is applied to the Soviet Union, it will supposedly participate in the committee. The Soviet delegation believes it is necessary to state that all these practices are merely attempts to divert the attention of the people of all countries, preventing them from noticing the policy adopted by the ruling circles of Western countries, primarily the United States, to obstruct the reaching of a disarmament agreement.

The Soviet government has stated more than once that it firmly condemns this policy and these actions of Western countries. The Soviet delegation is authorized to declare that the Soviet Union will not participate in this Disarmament Committee, the majority of whose members are members of military aggression blocs.

    苏联代表团再次声明
    苏联将不参加裁军委员会
    西方想利用裁军委员会掩饰原子备战
    新华社23日讯　据塔斯社纽约23日讯：苏联代表团22日向出席联合国大会第十二届会议的各国代表团散发声明，再次申明苏联将不参加联合国裁军委员会。
    声明谴责西方国家、首先是美国不愿达成裁军协议，并且硬要联合国大会通过一些不能作为停止军备竞赛和消除原子战争威胁的基础、而只会使今后的裁军谈判失败的决议。声明说，联合国大会在美国压力下通过的关于裁军委员会成员的决议正好证明了这一点，根据这个决议，裁军委员会的绝大多数成员将是西方国家军事集团的成员，仅是这一点就使得裁军谈判不可能有任何成效。美国和其他西方国家正在企图利用委员会作为幌子，来掩饰它们准备原子战争的政策。
    声明说，那些要联合国大会草草通过了自己的裁军决议的人现在企图把问题说成是这样：说苏联不参加上述裁军委员会只是装模做样，如果对苏联施加压力，据说苏联是会参加这个委员会的。苏联代表团认为有必要声明，所有这些做法不过是想转移各国人民的视线，使他们不去注意西方国家，首先是美国统治集团所采取的阻挠达成裁军协定的方针。
    苏联政府不止一次地声明，苏联政府坚决谴责西方国家这种政策和这种行为。苏联代表团被授权声明，苏联将不参加这个大部分成员都是军事侵略集团成员国的裁军委员会。
