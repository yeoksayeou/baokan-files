Xinhua News Agency, 21st dispatch: The Ministry of Justice has fully entered the third stage of the rectification campaign. Zheng Shaowen, Secretary of the Party Leadership Group of the Ministry of Justice, in a mobilization report on entering the third stage, put forward four aspects of rectification content, and pointed out that the Ministry of Justice should focus on opposing right-leaning tendencies and old legal concepts in the rectification.

In his report, Zheng Shaowen said that since the spring of this year, some judicial departments and some judicial cadres have committed right-leaning errors in their work, failing to severely punish criminals, failing to effectively protect the democratic rights of the people, and hindering the consolidation of the proletarian dictatorship and socialism. Some cadres in judicial organs have pitted "the people's courts independently conduct trials and only obey the law" against the court's obligation to obey the leadership of the Party, and some have even used this as an excuse to resist Party leadership in their trial work. Zheng Shaowen also said that many of these right-leaning errors are inseparable from old legal concepts. The Party Leadership Group of the Ministry of Justice is responsible for this.

Zheng Shaowen said that at present, some cadres in judicial organs neglect their duties and do not stand on the position of the state and the people to punish crimes, protect the people, and protect socialism, but instead try to think for criminals in every way. They do not base their judgments on the facts of the crime and the laws of the state, but instead seek various excuses to exonerate criminals, even those whose guilt is as solid as a mountain. Some cadres overemphasize the educational role of the people's courts. They do not fully understand the fundamental problem that the court is a tool of class dictatorship. As far as the enemy is concerned, they do not understand that the educational role of the court is embodied through trial activities. Taking the trial of criminal cases as an example, the goal of education is achieved by punishing crimes. In the trial of civil cases, education of the masses to abide by laws and discipline is achieved through a combination of coercion and persuasion. Zheng Shaowen said that these errors are all manifestations of right-leaning thought and old legal concepts.

Zheng Shaowen also talked about three other aspects of rectification content: namely, the guiding principles and tasks of the Ministry of Justice, the organizational structure, and the improvement of systems and work style. He said that the four aspects of the rectification in the Ministry of Justice mainly involve opposing right-leaning tendencies and opposing old legal concepts. Because these are fundamental issues in judicial work, if these issues are resolved, other problems in the work of the Ministry of Justice will be easier to solve. He proposed that the leadership of the Ministry of Justice should work with the masses to thoroughly solve this problem in this rectification, and wage a resolute and merciless struggle against right-leaning thought and old legal concepts.

Currently, cadres of the Ministry of Justice have begun studying documents, and will then engage in extensive airing of views, debate, and discussion.

    司法部转入整改阶段确定整改重点
    集中火力反对右倾思想和旧法观点
    新华社21日讯　司法部已全面转入整风第三阶段。中共司法部党组书记郑绍文在作转入第三阶段的动员报告中提出了整改内容的四个方面，并且指出，司法部在整改中应该着重反对右倾、反对旧法观点。
    郑绍文在报告中说，自今春以来，某些司法部门，和某些司法干部在工作中犯了右倾错误，对罪犯惩办不严，对人民民主权利保护不力，不利于巩固无产阶级专政和社会主义。有些司法机关的干部把“人民法院独立进行审判只服从法律”与法院必须服从党的领导对立起来，有的甚至借此在审判工作中来抗拒党的领导。郑绍文又说，这些右倾错误有不少是和旧法观点分不开的。司法部党组的工作对此是有责任的。
    郑绍文说，目前司法机关中有一些干部忽视自己职守，不是站在国家和人民立场，惩办犯罪，保护人民，保护社会主义，而是处处为犯罪分子设想，不是以犯人的犯罪事实为根据，以国家的法律为准绳，实事求是地审理案件，而是寻找各种借口，为犯人甚至为铁案如山的犯人开脱罪责。还有些干部过份强调人民法院的教育作用。他们没有完全理解法院是阶级专政的工具这一根本问题，对于敌人来说，不了解法院的教育作用是通过审判活动来体现的。以审理刑事案件来说是以惩办犯罪的方法达到教育的目的。就审理民事案件来说，也是以强制与说服相结合的方法来达到教育群众遵守法纪的。郑绍文说，这些错误都是右倾思想和旧法观点的表现。
    郑绍文还讲到另外三个方面的整改内容：即司法部的方针任务、组织机构、改进制度和作风等。他说，司法部这次整改中四个方面的内容主要是反对右倾、反对旧法观点。因为这些都是司法工作中的根本问题，这些问题如得到解决，司法部工作上的其他问题也就比较容易解决，他提出司法部领导方面要和群众一起，在这次整改中彻底地解决这一问题，同右倾思想、旧法观点作坚决的无情的斗争。
    现在司法部干部已开始学习文件，然后即进行大鸣大放大辩论。
