　　Ministry of Textile Industry Determines Key Areas for Rectification

　　(Our Newspaper News) The rectification movement in units directly under the Ministry of Textile Industry has entered the rectification and reform stage. On October 26th, Vice Minister Wang Dacheng, on behalf of the Ministry's Rectification Leadership Group, delivered a summary report on the anti-Rightist struggle and the transition to the rectification and reform stage to all staff members.

　　According to the spirit of the Eighth Central Committee's Third Plenary Session, the Rectification Leadership Group of the Ministry of Textile Industry has identified three areas as key points for rectification and reform. First, in accordance with the principle of building the country and running enterprises with diligence and thrift, examine and debate the shortcomings and errors in the formulation and implementation of business guidelines, policies, and major decisions. Due to bureaucracy and subjectivism in leadership, some business guidelines, policies, and major issues were not handled appropriately in the past. For example, the long-term situation of raw cotton was overestimated, leading to biases such as over-planning of new cotton mills and excessive training of cadres and workers in 1956. The flax factory established in Shuoxian County, Shanxi Province, was also hastily built (and later shut down) due to insufficient investigation and research, wasting state funds. Second, regarding the organizational structure. In the past, due to bloated organizations, unclear divisions of labor, and unclear responsibilities, many cadres had nothing to do. Some people satirized this situation as: "Going to work before sunrise and returning after sunset, drinking tea, reading newspapers, and smoking cigarettes." The division of labor between the various units of the Ministry was unclear, and the phenomenon of passing the buck in handling problems was very serious. For example, in 1955, a document concerning the purchase of machinery circulated among various units, with twenty-nine endorsement slips attached to the document, signed by 147 people, and traveling for one year and twenty-three days. Currently, the Ministry has drafted a new organizational structure plan and distributed it to all staff members for discussion. Third, regarding the work style of cadres. In the past, ministers, comrades in charge of cadre affairs, and directors of departments and bureaus rarely talked to cadres, and ideological and political work was poorly done. This situation should be changed in the rectification and reform stage.

　　Currently, the masses in the Ministry have launched a vigorous campaign of "big airing and big contending" (大鸣大放) centered on the above key points. In the past week, more than 3,500 big-character posters (大字报) have been put up in various units. Many big-character posters have forcefully exposed the bureaucratic style of leadership. For example, a big-character poster from the Finance Department revealed that 2,866 high-speed electric motors imported from the Soviet Union in 1952, worth more than 1.3 million yuan, had been left idle for five years at the Harbin Flax Factory. A big-character poster from the Supervision Bureau revealed that various mechanical equipment worth hundreds of thousands of yuan had been stockpiled in the warehouse of the Jingwei Textile Machinery Factory for many years without being attended to. After exposing the problems, many big-character posters also put forward rationalization proposals. The Technical Department alone had several proposed organizational structure plans submitted by individuals or groups. In order to improve the quality of raw cotton and increase the quality of yarn and cloth, a big-character poster suggested that each Textile Management Bureau send technicians to rural areas to help farmers improve cotton ginning work, in order to reduce impurities and improve the quality of raw cotton.

　　In order to carefully study and handle the opinions put forward by the masses, the Ministry has designated three assistant ministers to form special groups to study and handle the relevant opinions raised by the masses on business guidelines, policies, organizational structure, and cadre work. Each department, bureau, and company has organized a force of more than ten people to sort out and study the opinions aired by the masses. The Capital Construction and Design Company also stipulated that every morning, rectification leaders at all levels should organize concentrated research on the aired opinions and announce the results of the handling in the afternoon. In addition, units such as the Wool, Flax, and Silk Bureau have strengthened Party and League activities, giving play to the active leading role of Party and League members in the airing, and supervising and assisting Party and League members who are not active in airing and not willing to accept criticism.

### 下决心紧缩机构改变领导作风  纺织工业部确定整改重点

    下决心紧缩机构改变领导作风
    纺织工业部确定整改重点
    本报讯　纺织工业部直属单位的整风运动，已转入整改阶段。10月26日，王达成副部长代表部的整风领导小组，向全体工作人员作了反右派斗争总结和转入整改阶段的报告。
    根据中共八届三中全会的精神，纺织工业部整风领导小组，确定了三个方面的问题为整改重点。第一，根据勤俭建国、勤俭办企业的方针，检查业务方针政策、重大决定的制订与执行中的缺点和错误，并进行辩论。由于领导上的官僚主义与主观主义，过去在某些业务方针政策和重大问题上处理不够恰当。如曾对原棉的远景情况估计偏高，以致在1956年曾发生对新建棉纺厂规划过大、干部和工人培养过多等偏向。山西朔县建立的亚麻厂，也因为调查研究工作不够，草率地兴建厂房（后来又停了下来），浪费了国家资金。第二，关于机构问题。过去，由于机构臃肿，分工不明，责任不清，很多干部无事可做。有人讽刺这种情况是：“披星带月上班，喝茶看报抽烟”。部的各单位之间分工不明确，处理问题踢皮球的现象很严重。例如1955年，有一件关于购买机器的公文，经过各单位之间周转，公文上曾贴了二十九张签条，签字的达一百四十七人次，公文旅行了一年又二十三天。目前，该部已拟了一个新的机构编制方案，并发交全体工作人员讨论。第三，关于干部作风问题。过去，部长、干部工作部门的同志和司、局长很少找干部谈话，思想政治工作做得很差。这种情况，要在整改阶段予以改变。
    目前，该部群众已围绕上述重点，掀起大鸣大放热潮。一个多星期来，各单位已贴出大字报三千五百多张。许多大字报对领导工作中的官僚主义作风作了有力的揭发。如财务司的一张大字报揭发：1952年从苏联进口的二千八百六十六台快速电动机，价值一百三十余万元，但在哈尔滨亚麻厂却搁置了五年无人问津。监察局的大字报揭发了价值数十万元的各种机械设备，积压在经纬纺织机械厂仓库里，也是多年无人过问。许多大字报在揭发出问题以后，还提出了合理化建议。单技术司的大字报，对组织机构问题由个人或集体提出的建议方案就有好几种。为了改进原棉质量，提高纱布质量，一张大字报上建议各纺管局派技术人员到农村，帮助农民改进棉花轧制工作，以减少含杂，提高原棉质量。
    为了认真研究和处理群众提出的意见，该部指定了三位部长助理分别就业务方针政策、组织机构编制、干部工作等问题组成专门小组，负责研究处理群众提出的有关意见。各司、局、公司均组织了十多人以上的力量，整理和研究群众鸣放的意见。基建设计公司并规定每天上午，各级整风领导组织集中研究鸣放意见，下午公布处理结果。另外，毛麻丝局等单位，还加强了党团活动，发挥党团员在鸣放中的积极带头作用，对鸣放不积极和不虚心接受批评的党团员进行监督与帮助。
