    Jiangxi's First Mechanized Sugar Factory

    A mechanized sugar factory built in southern Jiangxi Province has recently started production. This sugar factory can process 350 tons of sugar cane per day, producing 31.5 tons of granulated sugar.

    Southern Jiangxi Province is close to Guangdong and rich in sugarcane production. In the past, farmers used indigenous methods to extract sugar, resulting in low sugar extraction rates and poor quality. This sugar factory is the first mechanized sugar factory in Jiangxi Province. A second mechanized sugar factory with a daily processing capacity of 1,000 tons of sugarcane has also commenced construction in southern Jiangxi. (Xinhua News Agency)

    江西第一个机制糖厂
    在江西省南部兴建的一座机械化糖厂，已在最近开工生产。这个糖厂每天可以处理甘蔗三百五十吨，产砂糖三十一吨半。
    江西南部地近广东，盛产甘蔗，过去农民都用土法榨糖，提糖率低、质量差。这个糖厂是江西省的第一个机制糖厂。第二个每日处理甘蔗一千吨的机制糖厂，也已在赣南动工兴建。（新华社）
