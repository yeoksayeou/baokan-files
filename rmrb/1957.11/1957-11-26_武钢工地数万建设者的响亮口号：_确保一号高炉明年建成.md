Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, November 25th: The construction of the Wuhan Iron and Steel United Enterprise has entered its peak construction period. On the vast construction site, more than twenty systems of engineering are under full and intensive construction, including iron smelting, coking chemicals, refractory materials, sintering, auxiliary repair facilities, as well as plant internal and external water supply and drainage, power, railways, highways, major and auxiliary mine construction, etc. These projects are mainly under intensive construction around the needs of the No. 1 blast furnace being completed and put into production by the end of 1958.

Late autumn and early winter in Wuhan are still a good construction season for construction sites. Tens of thousands of builders on the construction site have put forward the resounding slogan of "Ensure the completion and commissioning of No. 1 blast furnace on schedule" and have switched from one-shift operations to two-shift or three-shift operations. Nearly two thousand skilled workers transferred from Anshan, Wuhan, Henan and other places to support the construction of Wuhan Steel have also arrived at the construction site one after another.

    “确保一号高炉明年建成”
    据新华社武汉25日电　武汉钢铁联合企业的建设工程已经进入施工高峰。在辽阔的工地上，正在全面、紧张施工的有二十多个系统的工程，其中包括炼铁、炼焦化工、耐火材料、烧结、辅助修理设施，以及厂内外排供水、动力、铁路、公路、主要的和辅助的矿山建设等。这些工程主要是围绕着一号炼铁高炉在1958年年底建成和投入生产的需要而紧张施工的。
    深秋、初冬的武汉，仍然是建设工地的大好施工季节。工地上的数万名建设者提出了“确保一号高炉按期建成和投入生产”的响亮口号，纷纷改一班作业为两班或三班作业。从鞍山、武汉、河南等地调来支援武钢建设的近两千名技术工人，也已经陆续到达工地。
