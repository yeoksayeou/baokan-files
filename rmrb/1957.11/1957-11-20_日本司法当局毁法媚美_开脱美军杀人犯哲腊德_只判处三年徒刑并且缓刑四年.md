    Japanese Judicial Authorities Ruin the Law to Flatter the US
    Exonerate US Military Murderer Girard
    Sentence Him to Only Three Years with Four Years Suspended
    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 19th -- Tokyo News: Ignoring the crime of the American murderer Girard who deliberately lured and killed the Japanese farmer Sakae Nakako on January 30th of this year, the Maebashi District Court of Japan shockingly sentenced Girard in court this morning to only three years imprisonment with four years suspended.
    The US military authorities stationed in Japan immediately announced that Girard would be sent back to the United States within two weeks. Due to the US's extreme delay and obstruction of the Japanese side's interrogation of Girard, followed by various attempts to exonerate him, Girard has finally, more than nine months after he killed Sakae, effectively escaped the deserved criminal responsibility and punishment for murder.
    Prior to this, after the Maebashi District Public Prosecutor's Office held an interrogation of Girard, under the direction of the highest Japanese judicial authorities, they had only requested a five-year prison sentence for Girard.
    In today's court, Judge Kawauchi Yuzo, who had tried his best to exonerate the American murderer during the trial process, spent nearly an hour reading out the verdict on Girard.
    Kawauchi Yuzo finally said that after this verdict is announced, the prosecution authorities can decide whether to appeal within two weeks.
    After the sentencing, Watanabe, a prosecutor from the Maebashi District Public Prosecutor's Office, said that this verdict on Girard was completely unexpected.

### 日本司法当局毁法媚美  开脱美军杀人犯哲腊德  只判处三年徒刑并且缓刑四年

    日本司法当局毁法媚美
    开脱美军杀人犯哲腊德
    只判处三年徒刑并且缓刑四年
    据新华社19日讯　东京消息：日本前桥地方裁判所不顾美国凶手哲腊德在今年1月30日蓄意诱杀日本农妇坂井奈加子的罪行，竟在今天上午开庭宣判只判处哲腊德三年徒刑，并且缓刑四年。
    驻日美军当局随即宣布，哲腊德将在两周内被送回美国。由于美国极力拖延、阻挠日本方面对哲腊德进行审讯，继而又多方为他开脱，终于使哲腊德在他杀害坂井的九个多月以后实际上逃脱了应得的杀人罪责和惩处。
    在这以前，前桥地方检察厅在对哲腊德举行了审讯以后，在日本最高司法当局指使下，曾经只要求对哲腊德判处五年的徒刑。
    在今天的法庭上，在审讯过程中曾经极力为美国杀人犯开脱的裁判长河内雄三用了将近一小时的时间宣读了对哲腊德的判决书。
    河内雄三最后说，这项判决宣布以后，检察当局可以在两周内决定是否上诉。
    前桥地方检察厅检事渡边在宣判以后说，对哲腊德的这一判决完全是出于意外的。
