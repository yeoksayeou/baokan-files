Competing with the Bailong River for Land
By Our Reporter Liu Bang

The call to "advance on the Bailong River" stirs people's hearts. From Lianghekou in Dangchang to Linjiang in Wenxian, the front line stretches for more than 120 kilometers. Forty-three projects to build dikes, intercept the river, and reclaim land are underway in full swing. Thousands upon thousands of organized farmers are heroically fighting against natural disasters here day and night. In the past four years, they have already snatched back more than 15,000 mu of cultivated land from the raging river. This year, they will force the Bailong River to yield another 9,000 mu of land. This is a struggle of special significance undertaken by the Wudu Special District, which has little cultivated land and a large population, to solve the problem of food shortages.

Within the Wudu Special District, 90% of the area is high mountains and deep valleys, with only a strip of flatland along the Bailong River. This is the essence of the district's cultivated land. However, the turbulent Bailong River erodes the fertile land on both banks, breaking it into pieces, and turning good fields into wasteland in the blink of an eye. Year after year, the cultivated land in this area continues to decrease, so that the most densely populated Chuanba area of the entire district has an average of only nine fen of land per person. What is serious is that the river not only destroys farmland, but the main stream constantly rushes towards the villages, and the rolling waves threaten the villages and the safety of the people on both banks day and night. In the old society, the farmers here, forced by life, risked danger to reclaim land and raise the soil on the scattered river beaches, trying to plant crops. However, how could the small-scale peasant economy of individual households tame the Bailong River! After many failures, people came to a painful conclusion: "Raise the land in the morning and it washes away in the evening, raise the land in the evening and it's gone in the morning; raise the land all year round and see no grain!" Therefore, many farmers in this area rely on going to the mountains to peddle daily necessities such as oil and salt, in exchange for grain to make a living. In those days, if you asked them, "How is this year's harvest?" the answer was always: "Alas! We eat for half a year and run for half a year, and starve for half a year if we don't run." This fully reflects the farmers' distress and despair at not being able to settle down to agricultural production.

The Party always determines its tasks in response to the urgent demands of the masses. In the spring of 1953, the work team of the CPC Wudu District Committee came to the villages along the river where land erosion was serious, and studied with the local farmers how to defeat the Bailong River. The Party educates the people that only by understanding nature can we further transform and utilize it. People began to understand the "bottom line" of the Bailong River. After investigation and survey, it was confirmed that the riverbed of the Bailong River is generally relatively flat, with a total slope of about 0.2% to 0.4%. Places with large drops and prone to flooding are often caused by mountain torrent gullies. This can be controlled. The river surface of the Bailong River is 1,000 to 2,000 meters wide in some places. After calculating the maximum flow of the Bailong River, people realized that the riverbed width generally only needs to be maintained at about 150 meters, and the remaining river channels on both sides can be straightened by cutting bends and used as cultivated land. Roughly estimated: the Bailong River flows through sixteen townships in Wudu, about 16,000 households, and about 80,000 people. If all these beaches are reclaimed, each person can increase about four fen of paddy land. This type of paddy land yields 300 jin per mu in the first year, and the yield can be increased to 800 jin after three to five years of double cropping. This is a huge matter! Of course, to make the masses generally believe that man can conquer nature, there must be a visible, tangible, and living fact as mobilization. Therefore, the District Committee chose the Dongxing First and Second Agricultural Cooperatives of Hanwang Township as the focus, leading the farmers to launch a fierce struggle against the Bailong River. By the end of 1955, after three years, these two cooperatives had spent a total of 44,200 workdays, moved 6,680 cubic meters of stone, built a long dike, forced the river to return to its channel, reclaimed 1,400 mu of sandy beaches, dug out 8,000 cubic meters of sand and stone, and filled in 170,000 cubic meters of fertile soil. Last year—the first year that crops were planted on the newly reclaimed river beaches—one season yielded 250,000 jin of rice. This fact made the farmers along the river see a broad way to increase production. This year, the call of the Third Plenary Session of the Party Central Committee to vigorously develop agriculture has further increased the infinite strength of the farmers in this area.

I came to the river interception project site of Yongfeng First Agricultural Cooperative in Liangshui Township. What unfolded before my eyes was a moving picture: the roaring and raging Bailong, glittering with scales, like a snow-white dragon, seemed to be twisted by the nose, turning from north to south to the foot of the mountain, obediently turning according to the new river channel designated by the people. Tightly holding it back is a long dike more than 1,000 meters long, 4 meters wide, and 2 meters high, all built of stone. Nearly 3,000 mu of sandy beaches have been newly reclaimed inside the long dike, and male and female, old and young members are diligently filling the soil on it. A group of strong young men are continuing to carry stones to reinforce the long dike. They spent two months, before the river rose,抢digging this new riverbed 800 meters long and more than 30 meters wide, preparing an outlet for the river to divert its course. They built a long dike along the new riverbed, completing the thrilling task of blocking the water, intercepting the river, closing the long dike, and forcing the river to change its course. The first time they blocked the water and intercepted the river, they used oval bamboo cages, two meters long and more than one meter wide, filled with pebbles, and threw them into the river one by one. But after a few waves, the bamboo cages disappeared. More than 1,900 cubic meters of stone were swept away by the river. More than 950 workdays were wasted. Kind-hearted elderly people advised them: "Thirty years in Henan, thirty years in Hebei, this is the will of heaven!" However, they were not discouraged. The second time they tried to block the river with boulders as big as yaks, but unfortunately, due to the cumbersome stones, transportation difficulties, and insufficient preparation of materials, after a few large stones were swept away by the river, there was nothing to continue with, and it failed again. The last time, the number of participants surged to more than 1,000, more than 100 vehicles were dispatched, and more than 700 cubic meters of stone were concentrated, fighting for a full day and night, and the river finally succumbed to the people's strong will, obediently yielding a large area of cultivated land.

At this construction site, I saw how these diligent and simple farmers constantly trained, improved, and enriched themselves in the struggle against natural disasters. The first problem encountered in building the dike was that it was very difficult to move large stones. The farmers timely researched and created a "wooden crane". Large stones that originally could not be lifted by twenty or thirty people can now be operated freely by only three people using the crane. For blasting stones and drilling blast holes, the dry drilling method was initially used, and two people could only drill 1.2 inches deep in a day. Later, they came up with the idea of pouring some water into the blast hole, that is, changing to the water drilling method, and two people could drill 8 meters in a day. The efficiency was increased six times. When blasting stones with firecrackers, paper wicks were used at the beginning, and one person set off six at a time, which was very unsafe; later, old cotton was used as a wick, and one person could set off forty at a time, and it was safe. The dike was built, the river was diverted, and the river beach was reclaimed. But how can crops grow on sand and gravel! This requires filling the river beach with soil. One mu is sixty square zhang, and if two inches of soil are filled, 47,564 baskets are needed. One laborer can only carry 20 baskets a day. One mu requires more than 2,300 workdays. What a heavy labor! The farmers then held "Zhuge Liang meetings" and learned the "high-altitude soil transportation method". Now nine people can transport 2,400 baskets of soil in a day, which is equivalent to the labor of 120 people. In addition, they also adapted to local conditions, dug canals, and diverted water to wash the soil, and it only takes a few hours to flood one mu of land.

Labor struggle has also improved cadres. The Wudu Special District has achieved remarkable results in "competing with the river for land" in recent years, and has also gained some basic experience. First, it is necessary to investigate the maximum flood level, runoff, and flow velocity of the river, conduct survey and design, unify planning, determine the dike line, and then hand it over to the agricultural cooperative for construction. According to the size of the project, implement segmented management, train technical personnel, and basically ensure that each cooperative has someone in charge. After the autumn harvest and before the spring plowing, when the farming is slack and the water is dry, this is the most favorable season for "competing with the river for land". During this period, generally more than 60% of the labor force is invested in water conservancy construction. Cadres have also learned to run water conservancy projects diligently and thriftily in this struggle, and can do great things even without money. They vigorously advocate medium and small-sized projects, with small-sized and relatively easy-to-repair medium-sized projects all repaired by the masses themselves, and complex and near-large-sized projects run by the people with government assistance. Most of the forty dikes and 119 canals built by Liangshui Township, Wudu County in recent years belong to the masses' own repairs, and there are only eight projects invested by the state with the people's assistance. From 1955 to now, the state has only lent 88 yuan to the thirteen households of the Shipoer Cooperative, and they have blocked a large tributary of the Bailong River, built a dike of 150 meters, and reclaimed and filled 34 mu of land. In two years, the yield of rice increased by 10,500 jin, miscellaneous grains by 600 jin, and potatoes by 1,200 jin.

Rivers crisscross within the Wudu Special District, with large rivers including the Bailong River, Baishui River, Rhinoceros River, and Tao River, and no less than a hundred small rivers. Due to the changeable climate in the mountains and unstable rainfall, the rivers are sometimes turbulent and sometimes dry. Therefore, there are large areas of wasteland that can be used on both sides of the rivers. According to incomplete materials, it is estimated that if the "competing with the river for land" movement is universally launched throughout the district in the future, at least 50,000 mu of cultivated land can be reclaimed, which can increase grain production by more than 15.5 million jin. The people of Wudu Special District are fighting against water with the same spirit as Yu Gong moving mountains. (Attached pictures)

    同白龙江争地	本报记者　柳梆
    “向白龙江进军”的号角激荡着人心。从宕昌的两河口到文县的临江，战线蜿蜒一百二十多公里。四十三处筑堤截河淤地的工程紧张地在进行。成千上万组织起来的农民在这里夜以继日地同自然灾害英勇搏斗。过去四年，他们已经向汹涌澎湃的江水夺回一万五千多亩耕地。今年，他们还要强迫白龙江再吐出九千多亩地。这是耕地面积少、人口多的武都专区为了解决粮食不足的困难而采取的一项具有特殊意义的斗争。
    武都专区境内90％为高山深谷，只有白龙江沿岸是一溜平川。这是全区耕地的精华。可是，那湍急奔腾的白龙江水，把两岸的肥沃膏腴之地，啃得支离破碎，良田转眼沦为荒滩。年复一年，这一带的耕地不断减少，以致全专区人口最稠密的川坝地区每人平均只有九分地。严重的是，江水不仅摧毁了农田，而且主流不断直扑村边，滚滚浪花日夜威胁着两岸村庄和人民的安全。在旧社会里，这儿的农民迫于生活，曾经冒着危险，在那七零八碎的河滩上淤地抬土，企图种上庄稼。但是，一家一户的小农经济怎能驯服白龙江呢！经过多次失败以后，人们得出惨痛的结论：“早上抬地晚上淌，晚上抬地早上光；一年常抬地，不见一颗粮！”因此，这一带的农民很多都是依靠到山区贩点油盐之类的日用品，换回粮食糊口。在那个年代，如果你问他们：“今年的庄稼收成怎样？”回答总是：“唉！我们这里是吃半年跑半年，半年不跑饿半年。”这话充分反映了这里的农民无法安于农业生产的苦闷和绝望。
    党总是针对群众的迫切要求来决定自己的任务的。1953年春天，中共武都地委的工作组来到了沿江土地冲刷严重的村庄，和当地农民一道研究怎样斗倒白龙江。党教育人民，只有认识自然才能进一步地改造和利用自然。人们开始摸白龙江的“底”。经过调查勘测，证实白龙江的江底一般说来是比较平坦的，总坡度约为千分之二到千分之四。跌差大、容易泛滥成灾的地方往往是山洪沟作祟。这是可以治理的。白龙江的江面宽阔处达一、二千公尺。计算了白龙江最大的流量以后，人们认识到河床宽度一般只要保留在一百五十公尺左右，其余两边的河道完全可以裁弯取直，淤为耕地。粗略估计：白龙江在武都境内流经十六个乡，约一万六千多户，约八万多人口。如果这些滩地全部淤出来，每人约可增加四分水地。这类水地第一年亩产三百斤，三、五年后种两季产量可以提高到八百斤。这是一件天大的事啊！当然，要群众普遍相信人定可以胜天，就必须有一个眼看得见，手摸得着，活生生的事实作为动员。于是，地委选择汉王乡东星第一、二农业社为重点，领导农民向白龙江展开猛烈的斗争。到1955年底，历时三年，这两个社共付出了四万四千二百个劳动日，搬运了六千六百八十立方公尺的石块，筑成一道长堤，迫使江水归道，淤出一千四百亩沙滩，挖掉八千立方沙石，填上十七万立方肥土。到了去年——也就是新淤河滩地种上庄稼的第一年，一季就收了二十五万斤稻子。这一事实，使沿江农民看到一道宽广的增产门路。今年，党的三中全会发出的大力发展农业的号召，更使这一带的农民增加了无限力量。
    我来到两水乡永丰第一农业社的截河工程现场。展开在我的眼前的是一幅动人的画面：咆哮怒吼，鳞光闪闪，浑身雪练似的白龙，好像被拧着鼻子，由北向南，扭到山脚底下去，依着人们给它指定的新河道，驯顺地转着。紧紧拦着它的是一道长一千多公尺、宽四公尺、高二公尺、全部由石块砌成的长堤。长堤里面新淤出来近三千亩沙滩，男女老少的社员们正在上面辛勤地填土。一群精壮的小伙子正在继续搬运石块，加固长堤。他们用两个月的时间，在江水上涨以前，抢挖了这条八百公尺长、三十多公尺宽的新河床，给江水改道准备好出路。他们又沿着新河床筑了一条降龙长堤，完成了惊心动魄的堵水截河、使长堤合拢、迫江水改道的任务。头一次堵水截河时，他们用两公尺长、一公尺多宽的椭圆形竹笼，装满卵石，一个个地往江里抛。但是几个浪花过去之后，竹笼子就不见踪影了。一千九百多立方石头被河水卷走了。九百五十多个工化为乌有了。好心的老年人劝告他们：“三十年河南，三十年河北，这是天意啊！”然而他们并没有灰心。第二次用牦牛那样大的石块断河，可惜由于石方笨重，运输困难，备料不足，几块大石头被江水卷走之后就无以为继，再次失败了。最后一次，参加人数激增到一千多人，出动了上百辆车，集中了七百多立方石块，整整战斗了一个昼夜，江水终于屈服在人们强大意志的脚底下，乖乖地让出了大片耕地。
    在这个工地上，我看到这些勤劳淳朴的农民怎样在同自然灾害斗争中不断地锻炼、提高和丰富了自己。筑堤中首先遇到的问题是大块石头搬运起来很费劲。农民们及时研究创造了“木质起重机”。原来二、三十人抬不动的大石块，用起重机只要三个人就操纵自如了。炸石头打炮眼，最初用的是干钻法，两个人一天只能打一公尺二寸深。后来他们想出往炮眼里灌点水，也就是改用水钻法，两个人一天钻进八公尺。效率提高了六倍。点炮炸石头开始时用纸捻子，一人一次放六个炮，很不安全；后来改用旧棉花作捻子，一人一次可放四十个炮，而且安全。堤筑起来了，江水改道了，河滩淤出来了。但是沙砾上哪能长庄稼！这就得往河滩上填土。一亩地是六十方丈，如果填上二寸厚的土，就需要四万七千五百六十四背斗。一个劳动力一天只能背二十背斗。一亩地就要二千三百多个劳动日。这是一项多么沉重的劳动啊！农民们于是就开“诸葛亮会议”，学会“高线运土法”。现在九个人一天就能够运二千四百背斗的土，等于一百二十个人的劳动。此外他们还因地制宜，开挖渠道，引水冲土，几个钟头就可以漫一亩地。
    劳动斗争也提高了干部。武都专区这几年来在“与河争地”中取得了显著成绩，同时也取得了一些基本的经验。首先是要调查河流的最大洪水位、径流量和流速，进行勘测设计，统一规划，确定堤线，然后交农业社施工。根据工程大小，实行分段管理，训练技术人员，基本上作到社社有人负责。秋收后，春耕前，农闲水枯，这是“与河争地”最有利的季节。这段时间，一般都把60％以上的劳动力投入水利建设。干部在这场斗争中还学会了勤俭办水利，没钱也能办大事。他们大力倡办中小型工程，小型的和比较易修的中型工程全部由群众自修，复杂的和接近大型的工程民办公助。武都县两水乡几年来修筑的四十条堤和一百一十九条水渠大部分属于群众自修，国家投资民办公助工程只有八处。石坡儿社十三户社员从1955年到现在，国家只贷给他们八十八元，就堵塞了白龙江的一条大支流，筑堤一百五十公尺，淤地填土三十四亩。两年增产水稻一万零五百斤，杂粮六百斤，马铃薯一千二百斤。
    武都专区境内河流纵横交错，大的有白龙江、白水江、犀牛江和洮河，小的河流不下百余。由于山区气候多变，雨量不稳定，河流时而汹涌澎湃，时而水落石出。因此，河流两岸均有大片荒滩可资利用。据不完全的材料估计，今后全区普遍展开“与河争地”运动，最低限度还可以淤出五万多亩耕地，可以增产粮食一千五百多万斤。武都专区的人民正以愚公移山一样的劲头，和水作斗争。（附图片）
