Xinhua News Agency, Prague, November 19th: At yesterday's mass memorial rally for the funeral of Czechoslovak President Zápotocký, First Secretary of the Czechoslovak Communist Party (CCP) Novotný delivered a eulogy. Head of the Soviet delegation Voroshilov, head of the Polish delegation Zawadzki, and head of the Chinese delegation Li Xiannian also spoke at the rally.

On this day, hundreds of thousands of working people stood along all the streets from Prague Castle to Wenceslas Square, bidding farewell to the President on the streets.

The head of the funeral procession entered Wenceslas Square at 3:15 PM local time. The hearse stopped next to the rostrum. The President's coffin was placed on the catafalque next to the rostrum. At 3:40 PM, members of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, government leaders, CCP Central Committee Secretaries, leaders of the National Front, and personnel from various national delegations ascended the rostrum. At this moment, the Czechoslovak national anthem was played in the square, and cannons were fired in salute.

    Novotný Speaks

Subsequently, the mass memorial rally began. After a speech by the Secretary of the CCP Prague Municipal Committee, Krcek, First Secretary of the CCP Central Committee Novotný delivered a eulogy. He said, "Today, with heavy hearts and sorrow, we bid farewell to the great son of our working class, the outstanding worker of the Communist Party, and the excellent activist of the international workers' movement, Comrade Zápotocký. We express our condolences to this proletarian fighter who dedicated his entire life completely to the cause of liberation for the working class and all working people."

"Comrade Zápotocký's revolutionary life path embodies the entire development of the Czechoslovak workers' movement. He inherited and realized the aspirations of the founders of our workers' movement. For more than fifty years, he has been at the forefront of the struggle to win the victory of the proletarian revolution and the complete victory of socialism."

Novotný said, "Comrade Zápotocký was one of the first in Czechoslovakia to understand the historical significance of the October Revolution, and one of the founders and outstanding workers of the Czechoslovak Communist Party. Together with Gottwald, he unswervingly fought side-by-side, tirelessly, for the revolutionary Leninist line, for the Bolshevization of the Party, and for the establishment and consolidation of the worker-peasant alliance."

Novotný pointed out, "Firm belief in the victory of the working class, unity with the working people, conviction in the infinite power of the people, loyalty to the principles of Marxism-Leninism, loyalty to the Party, loyalty to internationalism and the Soviet Union – this was the source of Comrade Zápotocký's boundless revolutionary enthusiasm."

Novotný continued, "Comrade Zápotocký's tireless and comprehensive activities will forever be linked to the cause of building our new type of people's democratic republic. As the leader of the revolutionary trade unions and later as Prime Minister and President of the Republic, he was one of the first organizers of our socialist construction."

"Our obligation is to strive to strengthen the long-tested leadership of our people – the Communist Party – to ensure that we achieve further successes and victories. Our obligation is to strengthen the National Front, which embodies the unity of workers, peasants, and working intellectuals, and to dedicate all our strength to transforming our republic into a more consolidated bulwark of socialism, a happy homeland for all our working people."

Novotný said, "Comrade Zápotocký's work still exists. We will continue the cause of socialist construction that we began in 1945 with unwavering determination. We face many tasks. Completing these tasks requires everyone's perseverance, self-sacrifice, enthusiasm, and the spirit to overcome all difficulties, qualities that Comrade Zápotocký possessed. The Czechoslovak Communist Party, tempered in the fires of war, will lead the people to new victories."

    Voroshilov Speaks

After Novotný delivered his eulogy, the head of the Soviet delegation, Voroshilov, spoke first. On behalf of the CPSU Central Committee, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, the Soviet government, and all the Soviet people, he expressed deep condolences on the death of Comrade Zápotocký. He said that the people of socialist countries and all honest people in the world join the Czechoslovak people in expressing deep sorrow for the death of Comrade Zápotocký.

Voroshilov said, "Comrade Zápotocký lived a brilliant life as a professional revolutionary. His life was full of severe trials and hardships during the struggle for the liberation of the working people from the shackles of capitalism. However, neither the cruel persecution of class enemies, nor the torture and concentration camps of the Nazi fascists, were able to thwart his determination to fight for the cause of the proletariat, the freedom of the people, and the cause of peace. Together with his comrades-in-arms, he fought for the bright future of Czechoslovakia, made many efforts to consolidate the Czechoslovak Communist Party, expand the Party's influence on the masses, and unite the working class under the leadership of the Communist Party. Comrade Zápotocký was a tireless fighter for the establishment of the people's democratic system and socialist construction in Czechoslovakia. Comrade Zápotocký's tireless work can be seen in the outstanding achievements achieved by the Czechoslovak people."

Voroshilov continued, "Comrade Zápotocký was a versatile activist. The basic characteristics that determine all aspects of his political, social, and literary activities are: he was one of the most loyal fighters of the working masses, a person infinitely loyal to proletarian internationalism and who loved the people."

Voroshilov said that Comrade Zápotocký's life, like the activities of the entire Czechoslovak Communist Party, was full of concern for strengthening the solidarity, friendship, and friendly cooperation of the proletariat in socialist countries. Therefore, his name is not only particularly respected by the people of Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union, but also by the people of all socialist countries and all honest people in the world.

Comrade Zápotocký was a faithful friend of the Soviet Union. He understood well during his lifetime that this friendship not only brings great benefits to our two peoples, but also has important international significance. The Soviet people highly value the unbreakable friendship with the Czechoslovak people and the noble activities carried out by Comrade Zápotocký to strengthen this friendship. They will always remember Zápotocký's spirit of wholeheartedly and faithfully serving the interests of the working people, faithfully adhering to Marxism-Leninism, and his activities in building and prospering socialist Czechoslovakia and strengthening the friendship between the Soviet and Czechoslovak peoples.

The Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Soviet government, and the Soviet people will do everything possible to continuously develop and consolidate Soviet-Czechoslovak friendship, a friendship forged by the blood shed by the outstanding sons of the two peoples in the struggle against many enemies. Our friendship is eternal.

Voroshilov said, "While we feel grieved by the serious loss suffered by our fraternal Czechoslovak people, we are confident that you will unite more closely around your Communist Party, around the Central Committee of the Communist Party – the long-tested leader of the Czechoslovak working people in striving for the victory of socialism and building a communist society."

Voroshilov said, "We can be sure that the Czechoslovak working people, under the leadership of the Communist Party, will surely achieve new successes in consolidating the people's democratic state and solving the tasks you face. The Soviet Union, the great People's China, the people of all people's democratic countries, and all progressive people in the world are advancing with you."

    Zawadzki Speaks

The head of the Polish delegation, Zawadzki, then spoke. On behalf of the Polish United Workers' Party, the Council of State, the government, and the Polish people, he paid his final respects to Comrade Zápotocký and expressed fraternal sympathy to the Czechoslovak Communist Party, the government, the National Front, and all the Czechoslovak people.

Zawadzki said that Comrade Zápotocký had struggled tirelessly for decades for the liberation of the working class, against exploitation, evil, and unfair social systems, and for the victory of the great ideals of socialism, contributing tremendous strength and dedicating a brilliant life.

Zawadzki said that the Czechoslovak people and the people of socialist countries will never forget this courageous patriot, the loyal internationalist fighter, and the firm defender of the solidarity of socialist countries.

Zawadzki said, "In these days of great significance for the international workers' movement, as we celebrate the fortieth anniversary of the October Revolution and the outstanding achievements of the Soviet Union in science and technology, Comrade Zápotocký has left us. Now we are facing a struggle to further strengthen the fight for world peace, to finally liberate all mankind from the threat of war, and to win the victory of the Leninist principles of peaceful coexistence among countries. This makes us feel even more acutely the loss suffered by Czechoslovakia, socialist countries, peace, and the entire international workers' class movement due to the death of Comrade Zápotocký. Dear Comrade Zápotocký, we assure you that your firm belief in the future of world socialism will continue to live in the hearts of hundreds of millions of people."

    Li Xiannian Speaks

Next, the head of the Chinese government delegation, Li Xiannian, spoke. He said, "The delegation of the government of the People's Republic of China has come here with infinite sorrow to mourn with you the unfortunate death of Comrade Zápotocký, the beloved leader of the Czechoslovak people, the outstanding fighter of the international workers' movement, and the President of the Czechoslovak Republic. In these heavy days, the Chinese Communist Party, the government of the People's Republic of China, and all the Chinese people feel deep sorrow, just like the fraternal Czechoslovak people."

Li Xiannian said, "Comrade Zápotocký was an outstanding Marxist-Leninist, one of the founders of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, a close comrade-in-arms of Comrade Gottwald, and a faithful son of the Czechoslovak people. For decades, he has been holding high the banner of Marxism-Leninism, following the path of the great October Revolution, and has made persistent struggles and great contributions to the cause of liberation of the Czechoslovak working class and working people, to the establishment and consolidation of the people's democratic system, and to the cause of socialist construction, dedicating his brilliant life."

"Comrade Zápotocký has consistently made great efforts to strengthen the friendship between Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union, to consolidate and strengthen the solidarity and cooperation among socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union, and to defend world peace."

Li Xiannian continued, "Comrade Zápotocký closely followed the revolution and socialist construction of the Chinese people, was very concerned about the fraternal assistance of the government and people of the Czechoslovak Republic to China's socialist construction, and was very concerned about the enhancement of the friendship between the Chinese and Czech peoples. His deep friendship with the Chinese people has left an indelible impression on the Chinese people, especially those who have personally met him."

Li Xiannian said, "The death of Comrade Zápotocký is a major loss not only for the Czechoslovak people, but also for the people of socialist countries and the working people of the world. The working class and working people all over the world will deeply remember him with great respect for his name. His brilliant image of a communist fighter, who was simple, humble, loyal to the people's cause, and closely connected with the masses, will always live in our hearts. We believe that sorrow will be transformed into strength, and the Czechoslovak people will surely unite closely around the Communist Party and the government, and strive to complete the construction of socialism. The Chinese people will always unite with the Czechoslovak people to make unremitting efforts to further develop the friendship and cooperation between our two peoples, to consolidate the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and to defend world peace. Let Comrade Zápotocký's glorious contributions always inspire us to move forward bravely. Eternal glory to Comrade Zápotocký!"

The mass memorial rally ended with the singing of the Internationale. The President's coffin was placed on the hearse. The funeral procession moved towards the Prague crematorium.

At the funeral at the crematorium, the chairman of the Czechoslovak Central Council of Trade Unions, Supka, spoke and bid a final farewell to the President.

    在布拉格追悼萨波托斯基群众大会上
    诺沃提尼和各国代表致悼词
    据新华社布拉格19日电　在昨天捷克斯洛伐克总统安葬日举行的群众追悼大会上，捷共中央第一书记诺沃提尼致悼词。苏联代表团团长伏罗希洛夫、波兰代表团团长萨瓦茨基、中国代表团团长李先念相继在大会上讲了话。
    这一天，从布拉格宫到瓦茨拉夫广场的所有街道上，站立着几十万劳动人民，他们在大街上向总统告别。
    送殡队伍的前导在当地时间下午三时十五分进入瓦茨拉夫广场。灵车停在主席台旁。总统的灵柩安放在主席台旁的灵台上。三时四十分，捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会政治局委员、政府领导人、捷共中央书记、民族阵线领导人和各国代表团人员走上主席台。这时，广场上奏起捷克斯洛伐克国歌并鸣炮致哀。
    诺沃提尼讲话
    随后，群众追悼大会开始，在捷共布拉格市委会书记克尔策克致词后，捷共中央第一书记诺沃提尼致悼词。他说，我们今天怀着沉痛和悲哀的心情向我国工人阶级的伟大儿子、共产党的卓越工作者和国际工人运动的优秀活动家萨波托斯基同志告别。我们向这位无产阶级战士表示哀悼，他把自己整个的一生完全献给了争取工人阶级和全体劳动人民的解放事业。
    萨波托斯基同志的革命的生活道路是捷克斯洛伐克工人运动的整个发展的体现。他继承和实现了我国工人运动创始者们的遗志，五十多年来，他一直走在争取无产阶级革命胜利和争取社会主义彻底胜利的斗争的前列。
    诺沃提尼说，萨波托斯基同志是捷克斯洛伐克首先了解十月革命的历史意义的人之一，是捷克斯洛伐克共产党的奠基者和优秀的工作者之一。他同哥特瓦尔德一起毫不动摇地并肩进行不倦的斗争，为革命的列宁主义路线、为党的布尔什维克化、为建立和巩固工农联盟而斗争。
    诺沃提尼指出，坚信工人阶级的胜利、同劳动人民团结在一起、确信人民的无穷无尽的力量、忠于马克思列宁主义原则、忠于党、忠于国际主义和苏联，这就是萨波托斯基同志的无限革命热情的源泉。
    诺沃提尼接着说，萨波托斯基同志的不倦的和全面的活动将永远同我国建成新型的人民民主共和国的事业联系在一起。作为革命工会的领导者以及后来担任政府总理和共和国总统，他是我国社会主义建设的第一批组织者之一。
    我们的义务是竭力加强我国人民久经考验的领导力量——共产党，保证我们取得进一步的成就和胜利。我们的义务是加强体现工人、农民、劳动知识分子的团结的民族阵线，拿出全部力量来把我们的共和国变成社会主义的更加巩固的堡垒，变成我国全体劳动人民的幸福的祖国。
    诺沃提尼说，萨波托斯基同志的劳动还存在着。我们将坚定不移地把我们在1945年开始的社会主义建设事业继续下去。我们面临着不少任务。完成这些任务需要每个人的坚忍不拔、自我牺牲、满腔热忱和力求克服一切困难的精神，需要萨波托斯基同志所具备的那些品质。在战火中锻炼出来的捷克斯洛伐克共产党将引导人民走向新的胜利。
    伏罗希洛夫讲话
    在诺沃提尼致悼词后，首先由苏联代表团团长伏罗希洛夫讲话。他代表苏共中央、苏联最高苏维埃主席团、苏联政府和全体苏联人民，对萨波托斯基同志的逝世表示深切的哀悼。他说，社会主义阵营各国人民、世界上一切正直的人们为萨波托斯基同志的逝世，同捷克斯洛伐克人民一起表示深切痛悼。
    伏罗希洛夫说，萨波托斯基同志度过了职业革命家的光辉的一生，他的生活在为争取劳动人民从资本主义桎梏下解放的斗争时期内充满了严重的考验和贫困的遭遇。但是，无论是阶级敌人的残酷迫害，无论是纳粹分子的拷打和集中营，都没有能够挫折他进行为无产阶级事业、人民自由和和平事业的斗争决心。他同自己的战友一起，为捷克斯洛伐克的光明未来而斗争，为巩固捷克斯洛伐克共产党、扩大党对群众的影响以及为在共产党的领导下团结工人阶级做了许多努力。萨波托斯基同志是争取捷克斯洛伐克人民民主制度的确立和社会主义建设的不倦战士。在捷克斯洛伐克人民所获得的卓越成就中，可以看到萨波托斯基同志的始终不息的劳动。
    伏罗希洛夫接着说，萨波托斯基同志是一位全才的活动家。确定他的政治、社会和文学活动各方面的基本主要特征是：他是劳动大军最忠诚的战士之一，是一个无限忠于无产阶级国际主义和热爱人民的人。
    伏罗希洛夫说，萨波托斯基同志的一生同整个捷克斯洛伐克共产党的活动一样，充满着对加强社会主义国家无产阶级的团结、友谊和友好合作的关怀。因此他的名字不仅受到捷苏两国人民的特别尊重，而且也受到社会主义各国人民和全世界一切正直的人们的特别尊重。
    萨波托斯基同志是苏联的忠实朋友，他生前很好地理解，这种友谊不仅给我们两国人民带来巨大的利益，而且还具有重要的国际意义。苏联人民对于同捷克斯洛伐克人民的牢不可破的友谊以及萨波托斯基同志为了加强这个友谊所进行的崇高活动，给予极高的评价。他们将永远怀念萨波托斯基全心全意忠实于劳动人民的利益、忠实于马克思列宁主义的精神和他在建设和繁荣社会主义的捷克斯洛伐克、加强苏捷两国人民友谊方面的活动。
    苏联共产党、苏联政府和苏联人民将尽全力使捷苏友谊不断地发展和巩固，这个友谊是两国人民优秀儿子在反对许多敌人的斗争中洒的鲜血凝结成的。我们的友谊是永恒的。
    伏罗希洛夫说，当我们为我们的兄弟的捷克斯洛伐克人民遭到严重损失而感到痛心的时候，我们确信，你们将更加紧密地团结在自己的共产党的周围，团结在共产党的中央委员会——捷克斯洛伐克劳动人民争取社会主义的胜利、争取建设共产主义社会的久经考验的领导者的周围。
    伏罗希洛夫说，可以确信，捷克斯洛伐克劳动人民在共产党的领导下，在巩固人民民主国家和解决你们所面临的任务方面，一定能获得新的成就。苏联、伟大的人民中国、一切人民民主国家的人民和世界上的一切进步人士同你们一同前进。
    萨瓦茨基讲话
    波兰代表团团长萨瓦茨基接着讲话。他代表波兰统一工人党、国务委员会、政府和波兰人民向萨波托斯基同志致最后的敬意，向捷克斯洛伐克共产党、政府、民族阵线和全体捷克斯洛伐克人民表示兄弟般的同情。
    萨瓦茨基说，萨波托斯基同志几十年来为工人阶级的解放，为反对剥削、邪恶和不公平的社会制度，为社会主义的伟大理想的胜利，进行了不懈的斗争，贡献了巨大的力量，献出了光辉的生命。
    萨瓦茨基说，捷克斯洛伐克人民、社会主义各国人民将永远不忘记这位勇敢的爱国者，忠诚的国际主义战士，社会主义各国团结的坚定的维护者。
    萨瓦茨基说，在对国际工人运动具有重大意义的日子里，在我们欢庆十月革命四十周年和苏联在科学、技术上取得卓越成就的时候，萨波托斯基同志离开了我们。现在我们正面临着进一步加强争取世界和平、从战争威胁下最后解放全人类、以及争取各国和平共处的列宁主义原则胜利的斗争。这就使我们更加尖锐地感到捷克斯洛伐克、社会主义国家、和平和整个国际工人阶级运动因萨波托斯基同志逝世而受到的损失。亲爱的萨波托斯基同志，我们向你保证，你对世界社会主义未来的坚定信念将继续活在亿万人民的心里。
    李先念讲话
    接着，中国政府代表团团长李先念讲话。他说，中华人民共和国政府代表团怀着无限悲痛的心情来到你们这里，同你们一起哀悼捷克斯洛伐克人民爱戴的领袖、国际工人运动卓越的战士、捷克斯洛伐克共和国总统萨波托斯基同志的不幸逝世。在这些沉重的日子里，中国共产党、中华人民共和国政府和全中国人民同兄弟的捷克斯洛伐克人民一样感到深切的悲痛。
    李先念说，萨波托斯基同志是杰出的马克思列宁主义者，是捷克斯洛伐克共产党的缔造者之一，是哥特瓦尔德同志亲密的战友，是捷克斯洛伐克人民忠实的儿子。数十年来，他一直高举着马克思列宁主义的旗帜，沿着伟大十月革命的道路，为捷克斯洛伐克工人阶级和劳动人民的解放事业，为建立和巩固人民民主制度，为建设社会主义事业进行了坚持不懈的斗争，作出了巨大的贡献，献出了自己光辉的一生。
    萨波托斯基同志一贯为加强捷克斯洛伐克同苏联的友谊，为巩固和加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国的团结合作，为保卫世界和平而进行了巨大的努力。
    李先念继续说，萨波托斯基同志密切地注视着中国人民的革命和社会主义建设，十分关怀捷克斯洛伐克共和国政府和人民对中国社会主义建设的兄弟援助，十分关心中捷两国人民友谊的增强。他对中国人民深切的友情，给我们中国人民，特别是那些亲自见过他的人留下了不可磨灭的印象。
    李先念说，萨波托斯基同志的逝世不仅对于捷克斯洛伐克人民，而且对于社会主义各国的人民和全世界劳动人民都是重大的损失。全世界工人阶级和劳动人民都将怀着对他的名字的巨大尊敬而深深地怀念他。他的朴实、谦逊、忠于人民事业、密切联系群众的共产主义战士的光辉形象，将永远活在我们的心中。我们相信，悲痛将化为力量，捷克斯洛伐克人民必将亲密地团结在共产党和政府的周围，努力完成社会主义的建设。中国人民将永远同捷克斯洛伐克人民团结一致，为进一步发展我们两国人民的友好和合作，为巩固以苏联为首的社会主义阵营，为保卫世界和平而进行不懈的努力。让萨波托斯基同志的光辉贡献永远鼓舞着我们奋勇前进。萨波托斯基同志永垂不朽！
    群众追悼大会在国际歌声中结束。总统的灵柩被放在灵车上。送殡的行列向布拉格的火葬场走去。
    在火葬场的葬礼上，捷克斯洛伐克工会中央理事会主席苏普卡讲了话，向总统最后告别。
