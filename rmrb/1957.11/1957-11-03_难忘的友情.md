    Unforgettable Friendship
    Zhang Chen, Director of Shenyang Pneumatic Tool Factory
    As we jubilantly celebrate the 40th anniversary of the great October Revolution, I fondly recall the Soviet experts who worked with us to build the Shenyang Pneumatic Tool Factory.

    The reconstruction and expansion of the Shenyang Pneumatic Tool Factory, as well as the trial production and manufacture of a large number of new products, were all carried out with the comprehensive and selfless assistance of the Soviet government. The Soviet government provided the factory with a large number of advanced equipment of various kinds, and Soviet experts directly helped us from construction and installation to putting it into production. This enabled a dilapidated and outdated repair factory to be transformed into a modern professional pneumatic tool manufacturing factory in just over two years. During the construction process, the Soviet experts worked alongside us for more than two years as if they were building their own country. Their high degree of internationalism and serious and responsible attitude left us with an unforgettable impression.

    In 1953, when the newly built cutting and forging workshop was about to begin construction, winter arrived. At that time, we did not have experience in winter construction, and the cold winter directly affected the progress of the project. Comrade Bo. Yi. Danilichev, the Soviet construction engineer at the factory at the time, suggested: "Building socialism must race against time. In order to build the factory and put it into production sooner, we must seize every minute and every second." He specifically proposed suggestions for winter construction. Based on the expert's suggestions, we overcame many difficulties and ideological obstacles and organized winter construction. Comrade Danilichev was already very old, but during the construction process, in temperatures of twenty or thirty degrees below zero, he went up and down the scaffolding several times a day, braving the severe cold and treading on the snow, step by step, climbing to a height of dozens of meters to check the quality and safety of the project and provide specific guidance to the construction. He made a total of more than two hundred suggestions and had to work very late every day. Comrade Danilichev's selfless labor deeply moved the Chinese comrades. Under our joint labor, the cutting and forging workshop and the more than thirty-meter-high chimney were finally built in winter, ensuring the quality of the project and advancing the time by more than half a year.

    The original design for the roads of our factory was asphalt pavement. According to China's situation, this design standard was relatively high and not durable. Construction engineer Mi. Hua. Igorening suggested changing it to concrete roads, which would save money, be beautiful, and durable. Comrade Igorening also offered to redesign it himself. At that time, all the work was already very tight, and the winter of 1954 was approaching, making redesigning and completing the work on schedule a very heavy task. Comrade Igorening worked from morning till night, and after work, he took the drawings back to his dormitory to design. Near National Day, we saw that the experts were working too hard and were too tired. At the same time, several experts would be returning to their country in another month or two, so we said to Comrade Igorening, please let them go to Beijing for a few days during National Day. Comrade Igorening shook his head and waved his hand, saying: "We are so busy, there is no time to rest, not a minute or a second can be wasted." They resolutely refused to go. Comrade Igorening worked so hard, designing and guiding the construction at the same time, and the entire factory road project was finally completed at the end of November 1954, saving more than 100,000 yuan in funds.

    Experts gave us more specific help in mastering new equipment, trial-producing new products, and formulating organizational designs and improving management. This was an important condition for our production level to exceed the design level relatively quickly and to complete the first Five-Year Plan sixteen months ahead of schedule. We clearly remember that Comrade Kukuski came to the factory after the three-ton die forging hammer in the forging workshop was installed. On his first day in the workshop, he put on his work clothes and went to the steam hammer to check the mold, operating it while telling the workers how to hold the tongs, how to turn the workpiece, how to use the foot pedal switch, and so on. Sweat dripped from his face like beans. The workers advised him to rest for a while, but he said: "It doesn't matter, I want to teach you quickly, it doesn't matter if I'm a little tired!" He rarely left the forging hammer for eight hours each shift, wishing he could teach all his operating methods and practical experience to the workers in the shortest possible time. At the beginning, because the workers were not skilled in their operations, the production plan could not be completed. Comrade Kukuski was more anxious than the workshop workers. When he heard that the workshop was implementing two-shift production, he was afraid that the second shift would not operate well, so he asked to work with both shifts. When the workers heard this, they thought, how could this be possible! They were deeply moved, and their enthusiasm for learning was even greater. In less than three months, due to the workers' skilled techniques, the output was more than ten times higher than that of the old hammer, and there were very few rejects.

    During the experts' stay at the factory, we trial-produced more than a dozen new products. For the trial production of each new product, process engineer Comrade Fu. Hua. Kernyansinski, from reviewing drawings, preparing tool cards and gauges, to the key processes of each part in processing and the final assembly inspection, gave us many very specific guidance, and often even personally taught the relevant workers and cadres. Whenever a new product was successfully trial-produced, he was sincerely happy and congratulated us. When he was about to return to his country, we proposed a plan to organize an assembly line in the machine assembly workshop based on the current production situation and the requirements for production development. According to this plan, the original design of the machine tool layout had to be changed. When Comrade Kernyansinski's opinion was sought, he said that the original design was made three or four years ago, the situation has changed, and the production organization can of course be changed. Technology is constantly developing and progressing. He greatly encouraged and supported us. On this basis, we then carried out some work, and finally increased production capacity by about one time.

    In the process of more than two years, more than a dozen experts not only gave us many specific help in construction, installation, trial production of new products and improvement of production management, but more importantly, they trained a group of workers and cadres who mastered production and management of production from the theoretical and practical aspects.

    While the Soviet experts were working at the factory, we sent a group of cadres to the Leningrad Pneumatic Tool Factory in the Soviet Union for an internship of more than one year. During the internship, in order to shorten the internship time, the leaders of the Leningrad Pneumatic Tool Factory did not allow the Chinese comrades to live outside the factory, but vacated the chief engineer's office and a section chief's office for the Chinese comrades to live in. In order to make the food suitable for the Chinese comrades' tastes, they learned to make dumplings for the Chinese comrades to eat. During the year, more than a dozen interns lived and studied as if they were in their own country and family.

    The Shenyang Pneumatic Tool Factory is the crystallization of the joint labor of the people of China and the Soviet Union. In the future, we will further improve technology and management by learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and combining it with China's situation, so as to contribute more to the construction of the motherland and the prosperity of the socialist camp.

    难忘的友情
    沈阳风动工具厂厂长　张忱
    当我们欢欣鼓舞地迎接伟大的十月革命四十周年的时候，我亲切地忆起了和我们一起建造沈阳风动工具厂的苏联专家们。
    沈阳风动工具厂的改建和扩建，以及大批新产品的试制和生产，都是在苏联政府全面无私的援助下进行的。苏联政府为这个工厂提供了大批的各种先进设备，从建筑、安装到投入生产，都有苏联专家直接帮助我们。这才能使一个残破不全的和陈旧落后的修配工厂，在两年多的时间内变成了一座现代化的风动工具的专业制造工厂。在建厂过程中，苏联专家像建设自己的祖国一样，和我们共同劳动了二年多。他们高度的国际主义精神和认真负责的工作态度，给我们留下了永远不能忘记的印象。
    1953年，新建的切料锻压车间场房正要施工的时候，冬天来了。当时我们还没有冬季施工的经验，寒冷的冬天直接影响着工程进度。当时在厂的苏联建筑工程师波·依·达尼里切夫同志提出建议说：“建设社会主义必须和时间赛跑，为了早一天把工厂建设起来，早一天投入生产，就得抓紧一分一秒的时间。”他具体地提出了冬季施工的建议。根据专家的建议，我们克服了许多困难和思想阻碍，组织了冬季施工。达尼里切夫同志年纪已经很大了，但在施工过程中，在零下二、三十度的天气里，他每天总是三番五次的，冒着严寒，踏着积雪，一步步地沿着跳板，爬到好几十公尺的高空，检查工程质量和安全，具体指导施工。他一共提出了二百多项建议，每天都要工作到很晚。达尼里切夫同志这种忘我的劳动，深深地感动了中国同志。在我们共同的劳动下，切料锻压车间场房和三十多公尺高的烟囱，终于在冬季里建成了，保证了工程质量，时间提前了半年多。
    我们厂的道路工程，原设计是柏油路面。根据我国的情况，这种设计标准是比较高的，又不耐用。建筑工程师米·华·依果宁同志，建议改为混凝土路，既节省资金，又美观、耐用。依果宁同志并且提出由他自己重新设计。当时各项工作已经非常紧张，1954年的冬天又将逼近，重新设计，又要按期完工，这是很繁重的任务。依果宁同志从早忙到晚，下班以后还要把图纸带回宿舍去设计。临近国庆节时，我们看到专家们工作太紧张，太累，同时有几位专家再过一两个月就要回国，就同依果宁同志说，请他们在国庆节到北京去玩几天。依果宁同志却摇摇头，摆摆手说：“这么忙，哪有时间休息，一分一秒也不能耽误”。他们坚决不去。依果宁同志就这样紧张地工作着，一边设计，一边指导施工，全厂道路工程终于在1954年11月底完工，共节省了十多万元资金。
    在掌握新设备，试制新产品，以及制订组织设计，改进管理等方面，专家给了我们更多更具体的帮助。这是我们的生产水平能够比较迅速地超过设计水平，并且提前十六个月完成第一个五年计划的一个重要条件。我们清楚地记得，当锻压车间的三吨模锻锤安好以后，库库斯基同志来到了工厂。他到车间的第一天，就穿上工作服，到汽锤旁检查模子，一边操作，一边告诉工人怎样掌钳，怎样翻活，怎样用脚踩开关等。他脸上汗珠像豆子似的往下淌。工人劝他休息一会，他说：“不要紧，我要赶快把你们教会，累点没什么！”每班八小时，他很少离开锻锤，恨不得把他的操作方法和实际经验在最短的时间内全部教给工人。开始的时候，因为工人操作不熟练，生产计划完不成，库库斯基同志比车间工人还着急，听到车间实行两班生产，他怕第二班操作不好，要求跟着两班干。工人同志们一听，这哪能行！深深地受到了感动，学习的劲头更足了。在不到三个月的时间内，由于工人技术的熟练，产量比旧锤提高了十倍多，废品也很少。
    专家在厂期间，我们试制了十几种新产品。每种新产品的试制，工艺工程师符·华·克恩扬辛斯基同志，从审核图纸，准备工卡量具，以及加工中每个零件的关键工序和最后装配检查，都给了我们许多非常具体的指导，甚至常常亲自动手去教导有关的工人和干部。每当一种新产品试制成功，他从心眼里高兴，向我们祝贺。他快要归国的时候，我们根据当时的生产情况和生产发展的要求，提出在机装车间组织流水生产线的方案。根据这个方案，要改变原设计的机床平面布置。当征求克恩扬辛斯基同志的意见时，他说原设计是三、四年前规定的，情况变了，生产组织当然也可以变，技术是不断发展不断进步的。他大力地鼓励并支持了我们。在这个基础上，我们以后又进行了一些工作，终于使生产能力提高一倍左右。
    二年多的过程中，十几位专家不但从建筑、安装、试制新产品和改进生产管理中，给了我们许多具体的帮助，更主要的，是他们从理论上和实际操作方面，为我们培养了一批掌握生产和管理生产的工人和干部。
    在苏联专家在厂工作的同时，我们派了一批干部到苏联列宁格勒风动工具厂实习了一年多。在实习过程中，列宁格勒风动工具厂的领导同志为了缩短实习时间，他们不让中国同志住在厂外，而把总工程师的办公室和一个科长的办公室腾出来，让中国同志住宿。为了使饭食适合中国同志的口胃，他们学习包饺子给中国同志们吃。一年多的过程中，十几位实习生如同学习和生活在自己的祖国和家庭中。
    沈阳风动工具厂是中苏两国人民共同劳动的结晶。今后，我们将在学习苏联先进经验的基础上，结合中国情况，进一步提高技术，改进管理，以便为祖国建设和社会主义阵营的繁荣贡献更多的力量。
