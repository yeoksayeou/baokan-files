    Celebrating the Fortieth Anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution
    Forty Years of Struggle for Peace
    Zhang Wentian
    The great October Socialist Revolution established the first proletarian dictatorship of workers and peasants in a country that occupied one-sixth of the world’s landmass. From its birth, this country declared the implementation of a foreign policy unprecedented in history, thus opening a completely new era in international relations. In any society of exploiters, foreign policy is the policy of the ruling exploiting class, a selfish policy that they rely on to harm the interests of the people and carry out behind their backs. For many capitalist countries, the basic purpose of foreign policy is to seize more territory or "spheres of influence" for a few capitalist groups, to enslave the people of other countries, and to obtain the most favorable conditions. Marx and Engels once pointed out, "To set the people of different regions against each other, to use one nation to oppress another, and to ensure the continued existence of autocratic power, is the art and activity of all rulers and their diplomats up to the present time." However, the Soviet state produced by the October Revolution fundamentally changed this situation. It held high the banner of proletarian internationalism, regarding the safeguarding of national equality, independence and freedom, striving for world peace and international cooperation, and opposing imperialist aggression and war as the guiding principles of its foreign policy. Thus, a new era emerged in international relations and foreign policy, and a struggle between two lines began on a global scale. One is the line of socialist countries aimed at ensuring world peace and friendly cooperation between the people of all countries; the other is the line of imperialist countries aimed at preparing and launching wars of aggression and enslaving the people of all countries.

    Striving for peace is the fundamental policy of Soviet foreign policy, which is determined by its social system and national character. A country's foreign policy is a continuation of its domestic policy and serves its domestic policy. Soviet foreign policy, like its domestic policy, is a policy to protect the interests of the working class and other working people, and its basic purpose is to create the most favorable international conditions to ensure domestic socialist and communist construction. Lenin once said when talking about the basic tasks of the Soviet state's foreign policy, "We need peaceful construction, we must carry out peaceful construction, and we will devote all our energy and all our lives to peaceful construction." Because only peaceful construction can vigorously develop production, fully realize the purpose of socialist production, and meet the ever-growing material and cultural needs of the people. For this reason, a peaceful international environment is required, while war can only hinder and disrupt the progress of construction. At the same time, socialist countries, due to the public ownership of basic means of production and the planned development of the national economy, will never experience overproduction and economic crises, and therefore do not need to find a way out from war like imperialism, and do not need to carry out external expansion and compete for markets. The Soviet state is a state of proletarian dictatorship, a state in which the working people are in power, and it has overthrown the classes and groups that tried to expand the scope of exploitation and seize new territories and rely on the arms race to obtain maximum profits at home, thereby eliminating the fundamental basis for launching wars and carrying out aggression. The working class and other working people live by their own labor, and their class nature is to love peace and oppose war. Because the only beneficiaries of imperialist wars are a few monopoly capitalist groups, while the working people have to bear all the heavy burdens of war and suffer huge sacrifices. Therefore, the proletarian dictatorship and the working people in power naturally determine the peaceful nature of the country's foreign policy.

    The peace policy of the Soviet Union as a socialist country is based on Lenin's theory of peaceful coexistence. Due to the uneven economic and political development of capitalist countries during the imperialist period, socialist revolutions cannot be victorious in all countries at the same time, which makes the simultaneous existence of capitalist countries and socialist countries inevitable. Although imperialist countries have never given up, they have never been able to eliminate socialist countries, and repeated contests have failed. This shows that socialism is the inevitable result of human history, and imperialism cannot turn the wheel of history backward. As Lenin said, when the majority of workers and peasants of a nation realize that they are fighting for the power of the working people and the cause of socialism, "such a nation is forever invincible." As for socialist countries, they believe, according to the Marxist doctrine they adhere to, that revolution cannot be exported, whether or not a revolution takes place depends on the historical conditions of each country, is a matter for the people of each country, and opposes any interference in the internal affairs of other countries. Moreover, socialist countries firmly believe in the superiority of their own social system and believe that they can win in peaceful competition. Therefore, there is no need to resort to war at all. In this way, peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems is not only possible but also inevitable.

    This foreign policy based on the principle of peaceful coexistence not only conforms to the interests of the Soviet people but also conforms to the interests of the people of the world. Because the only people who need war are a small group of exploiters in some countries, while the common desire of the people of all countries is to oppose war and strive for peace. Not only do countries where the working class has seized power need a peaceful international environment to carry out socialist and communist construction, but the people of all other countries also demand to live in peaceful conditions in order to ensure security and strive for progress. Therefore, the Soviet state's peaceful foreign policy is a truly people's foreign policy, which has won the firm support of its own people and the widespread support of the people of the world. For the first time, the struggle for peace throughout the world has a powerful tool of the state, and a truly peace-loving power to take the lead. This has brought the struggle for lasting peace and international cooperation into a new stage. The people of all countries have good reason to regard the Soviet state as their reliable fortress and glorious banner for safeguarding peace and security.

    The forty years of the Soviet Union's existence have been forty years of struggle for peace. Over the past forty years, the Soviet Union has made tremendous contributions to the cause of peace in every period and has also achieved brilliant achievements. Although the bellicose imperialist bloc has always dreamed of extinguishing it, this fortress of peace has not only not been eliminated but has also grown stronger and stronger at a rapid pace. The maintenance of world peace is now completely linked to the existence and strength of the Soviet Union.

    The contribution of the October Revolution to the cause of world peace is immeasurable. As early as the day after the outbreak of the October Revolution, the All-Russian Congress of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies passed Lenin's famous "Decree on Peace," officially proposing that all belligerent countries stop the war and immediately conclude a comprehensive, just and democratic peace treaty that does not require annexation or indemnity, and declared the imperialist war as the greatest crime against humanity, calling on the people of all countries to rise up and strive for peace. Although the imperialist powers ignored this, the Soviet state still insisted on making peace efforts and finally withdrew Russia from the war. This was an extremely serious blow to the imperialist bloc that hoped to continue the bloody massacre. At that time, the Soviet state's peace policy and actions had a huge impact internationally, bringing the struggle for peace to a climax. The people of all countries have already taken concrete actions to oppose war and strive for peace. At the same time, the victory of the October Revolution and the Soviet state's declared implementation of the policy of national equality, advocating national self-determination, and the initiative to abandon the unequal treaties signed by Tsarist Russia with China and other Eastern countries greatly promoted the awakening of oppressed nations, and many colonial and semi-colonial people launched a magnificent national revolutionary movement to fight for independence and freedom and against imperialist enslavement. All of these made the rear of imperialism more unstable and shaken, and the war was difficult to continue. The First World War finally stopped. In this way, the Soviet state shortened the duration of the First World War and stopped the imperialist massacre with its peace efforts and their impact, thus making historical contributions to world peace and human civilization.

    International imperialism showed the greatest unease and hatred towards the victory of the October Revolution and the establishment of the Soviet socialist state. They feared that the existence and development of socialist countries would become an example for the people of their own countries and the people of colonies and semi-colonies to carry out revolution and liberation struggles, and they feared that socialist countries as fortresses of peace would hinder them from pursuing their policies of aggression and war. Therefore, they tried their best, as Churchill openly admitted, to strangle the Soviet state in its cradle. As soon as the October Revolution broke out, the imperialist powers immediately began to prepare and carry out armed intervention against the Soviet Union. In this matter, American imperialism played a leading role. It used its economic power, which had made a fortune in the war, to provide extensive financial assistance and material supplies to all anti-Soviet forces, and later directly sent its own troops to invade the territory of the Soviet state. Just after the end of World War I, imperialist countries such as the United States, Britain, and France organized and launched armed intervention by fourteen countries in an attempt to destroy the Soviet regime and finally divide Russia. However, these attempts did not succeed. Although socialist countries oppose war and advocate peace, as Engels pointed out as early as 1844, in the case of a war of self-defense, the members of this society "will definitely defend the real motherland, the real home," so they "will fight with enthusiasm, fortitude, and courage, so that even the mechanized modern army will be defeated." In fact, it was exactly like this. After nearly three years of heroic struggle, the people of all nationalities in the Soviet Union, under the leadership of the glorious Communist Party of the Soviet Union, finally completely crushed the armed intervention of imperialism. The victory against armed intervention not only defended the young socialist country but also saved world peace. This is another major contribution of the Soviet Union to the cause of peace.

    In the struggle against the armed interventionists, the Soviet Union's peaceful foreign policy played a huge role. Lenin said, "We have fought for peace with great perseverance." "On this front, we have shown great skill, at least no worse than the activities of the Red Army on the bloody front." The Soviet government constantly exposed the aggressive aims and crimes of the armed interventionists, winning widespread sympathy and broad support from the people of all countries, who used concrete actions to assist the Russian people and hold back the interventionists. The Soviet government made full use of all the contradictions in the imperialist camp, divided the enemy with its own peace policy, and won over its neighbors. By the spring of 1921, it had successively concluded peace treaties with the eight countries surrounding it. Therefore, the victory against armed intervention fully proved the superiority of the worker-peasant regime and the superiority of the Soviet socialist system, and also proved the superiority of the peaceful foreign policy.

    However, the failure of armed intervention did not sober the imperialists, and they still insisted on the goal of eliminating the Soviet Union. After the failure of armed intervention, they adopted a series of measures against the Soviet Union, such as political isolation, economic blockade, military pressure, intimidation and blackmail, as well as supporting counter-revolutionary forces internally and organizing subversive and sabotage activities. The United States imperialism still played a leading role in these aspects. Although it was the first to recognize the reactionary Russian Provisional Government before the October Revolution, it has always closed its eyes and refused to recognize the Soviet Union. Just as in its attitude towards China, it was previously the first country to recognize the reactionary government of Chiang Kai-shek, but now it insists on not recognizing the People's Republic of China. These conspiracies of international imperialists undoubtedly caused some difficulties for the Soviet people at that time. However, the people who have taken control of their own destiny and stood up are invincible, and these difficulties did not scare the Soviet people. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Soviet people overcame these difficulties, consolidated their internal affairs, broke through the imperialist blockade, made the Soviet Union stronger, and significantly improved its international status. Due to the consolidation and growth of the Soviet Union, as well as the deepening of internal contradictions and difficulties in the imperialist camp, the Allied countries at that time had to recognize the equal status of the Soviet Union at the Genoa Conference in early 1922. With the gradual normalization of trade relations, it was bound to lead to the establishment of diplomatic relations. Most capitalist countries such as Britain and France finally officially recognized the Soviet Union about seven years after the founding of the Soviet Union, and the most stubborn American imperialism had to establish normal diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union after sixteen years. The League of Nations, which had long excluded the Soviet Union, could not but take the initiative to invite the Soviet Union to participate after seventeen years. In this way, the imperialist policies of political isolation, economic blockade, subversion and sabotage against the Soviet Union, like the result of armed intervention, also completely failed.

    During this period, Soviet diplomacy made a series of major efforts to establish normal political and economic relations with various countries and to maintain world peace. At the Genoa Conference in 1922, the Soviet delegation, in accordance with Lenin's instructions, proposed a proposal for universal disarmament. At the end of the same year, the Soviet government proposed to convene a disarmament conference in Moscow with the participation of Poland and the Baltic countries. In 1924, the Soviet Union overcame the obstruction and sabotage of the United States and established diplomatic relations with most countries in Europe and Asia. In 1927, the Soviet Union participated in the meeting of the preparatory committee for the Geneva Disarmament Conference and put forward its own positive proposals. In 1928, the Soviet Union joined the Kellogg-Briand Pact. In order to maintain peace and break the imperialist conspiracy to establish an anti-Soviet alliance, from 1925 to 1933, the Soviet Union successively concluded non-aggression treaties or neutrality treaties with eleven countries, including Turkey, Germany, Iran, Poland, France, and Italy. The various diplomatic efforts of the Soviet Union during this period further consolidated its position, safeguarded its national independence, and won equal status in international relations. At the same time, this played a huge role in defending world peace, exposing the imperialist aggression and war preparation conspiracies, and disrupting their steps and plans. The Soviet Union, which adhered to the peace policy, increasingly became a major obstacle to imperialism's aggression and launching of war.

    The Soviet Union's ability to make major contributions to the cause of peace is inseparable from the growing strength of the Soviet Union. After the period of recovery of the national economy and the construction of two five-year plans, the Soviet Union has realized the industrialization of the country and the collectivization of agriculture, completed the cultural revolution, eliminated the exploiting classes, and built a socialist society. By 1939, the Soviet Union's total industrial output had changed from the fifth in the world and the fourth in Europe before the revolution to the second in the world and the first in Europe, surpassing all capitalist countries except the United States. This speed of development was completely unimaginable by capitalism. This very powerfully demonstrated the superiority of the socialist system. Therefore, the victory of socialist construction in the Soviet Union was a huge contribution to the cause of world peace and human progress.

    Before World War II, the Soviet Union made a series of efforts to prevent war and strive for collective security. The Soviet Union concluded mutual assistance pacts with France, Czechoslovakia, and other countries in 1935 and was prepared to provide military assistance to countries threatened by aggression. However, these efforts did not succeed. Because at that time, international imperialism, especially the monopoly capital groups of the United States, had other plans, which was to try their best to support the militarist forces of Germany, Italy, and Japan, and attempt to make them act as shock troops to attack the Soviet Union. They placed their greatest hope on organizing an anti-Soviet war, so that they could both destroy the socialist construction of the Soviet Union and even eliminate this beacon of human progress and fortress of peace, and alleviate the internal contradictions and crises of imperialism. Therefore, from 1924, they provided Germany with a large amount of long-term and short-term investment according to the "Dawes Plan" to restore Germany's military industrial potential and establish an economic foundation for arming Germany; in 1925, the "Locarno Treaty" created the necessary political conditions for attracting Germany to participate in anti-Soviet conspiracies; later, they supported the German fascists to power and instigated Japan to invade and occupy Northeast China, thus creating two sources of war in the East and the West. When Japan intensified its aggression against China, Italy occupied Abyssinia, Germany and Italy intervened in Spain, and Germany sent troops to the demilitarized zone of the Rhineland and annexed Austria, the Soviet Union actively exposed and condemned the aggressors, and provided moral and material assistance to the countries that were invaded, such as supporting Spain, concluding a non-aggression treaty with China, and helping China resist Japan. At the same time, it repeatedly suggested that the United States, Britain, France, and other countries take necessary measures together to stop aggression, and on the eve of the war, it conducted more than four months of negotiations with Britain and France, hoping to establish a collective security system to prevent the outbreak of war. However, the ruling groups of the United States, Britain, and France insisted on the so-called "non-intervention policy" and "appeasement policy," using the method of sacrificing China and some small countries in Europe to clear the way for Germany, Italy, and Japan, which had concluded the "Anti-Comintern Pact" and the "Axis Powers," to attack the Soviet Union. Therefore, they not only did not interfere with Japan's aggression against China but also provided material assistance to it; they implemented the notorious "Munich Policy" towards German and Italian fascists, conniving, provoking, and expanding the war. As Chairman Mao said in the article "The Unity of Soviet Interests and Human Interests," "The governments of Britain, the United States, and France have no sincerity in preventing the outbreak of the war; on the contrary, they promoted the outbreak of the war." "The plan of Britain, the United States, and France is to: push Germany to attack the Soviet Union, and they themselves 'sit on the mountain and watch the tigers fight,' and after the Soviet Union and Germany are exhausted, they will come out to clean up the situation." This analysis was later confirmed by Truman, the spokesman for the American reactionary group. He stated in June 1941 that "if we see that Germany is victorious, we should help Russia; but if Russia is victorious, we should help Germany, so that they can kill each other endlessly, the more the better." However, the development of history did not follow the wishes of the imperialists. Due to the fact that the interests of competing monopoly groups exceeded class interests, as well as the weakness of Britain and France and the strength of the Soviet Union, and in order to ensure the security of their rear in the anti-Soviet war, Hitler's Germany first launched an attack on France and Britain. Based on its peaceful foreign policy, the Soviet Union not only fought for peace until the last moment but also shattered the conspiracy of the United States, Britain, and France to push Germany to attack the Soviet Union with the Soviet-German Non-Aggression Pact when war was inevitable. This won the Soviet Union a period of peace and the possibility of preparing forces to counter the enemy. This also shows the Soviet Union's loyalty to the cause of peace and the superiority of its peace policy.

    World War II was a severe test for the Soviet Union. Hitler's Germany, which was supported by the United States, Britain, and France, after invading and enslaving eleven countries in Europe, took advantage of its victory to perfidiously launch a large-scale attack on the Soviet Union, attempting to conquer the Soviet Union in a short period of time with a blitzkrieg. Not only the fascists, but also many figures in the ruling class of the United States and Britain predicted the rapid collapse of the Soviet Union. But the facts were the opposite, and the Soviet people, under the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, launched the Great Patriotic War and heroically shattered the conspiracies and delusions of Hitler's Germany and its supporters. Because the Soviet Union had completed the national industrialization, the collectivization of agriculture, and the cultural revolution, eliminated the counter-revolutionaries at home, and made full preparations for self-defense before the war, it was fully capable of resisting fascist aggression. The purpose of the Soviet Patriotic War was not only to save its own motherland but also to liberate the people of all countries enslaved by German fascists. It was precisely because of the Soviet Union's participation in the war that the democratic and liberation nature of World War II was determined. During the Patriotic War, Soviet diplomacy brilliantly completed the task of establishing an anti-fascist alliance and isolating the fascist bloc, and played a huge role in achieving victory in the war. After the German fascists attacked the Soviet Union, the anti-fascist alliance began to be established, and by the time of the Soviet-British-American Moscow Conference in September 1941, the joint action program of this alliance had been determined. But even in this situation, the American and British imperialists still intended to sacrifice the Soviet Union to improve their own situation and hoped that their German competitors would be weakened in the war, and the Soviet Union would be devastated, and then they could force both sides to accept their peace terms. Therefore, although the Soviet-British Alliance Treaty and the subsequent Soviet-American communiqué confirmed that the United States and Britain would open up a second front in Europe in 1942, they did not fulfill their obligations and delayed it under various pretexts. It was not until June 1944, when the Soviet Union had already launched a large-scale counter-offensive, when the situation in which the Soviet Union could defeat fascist Germany alone and liberate the enslaved people of various countries in Europe was completely clear, that the United States and Britain sent troops to land in France, and they also focused their attention on infiltrating the Balkans. At that time, the purpose of the United States and Britain landing in Europe was not so much to assist the Soviet Union in defeating fascist Germany as to bring as much of Europe as possible under their influence, save capitalism in many European countries from collapse, prevent the Soviet army from pursuing the fascists, and preserve the remaining forces of German militarism so that they could once again serve as their anti-Soviet shock troops in the future. Therefore, after the opening of the second front, the American and British troops did not actively engage in combat against Germany and even attempted to cooperate with the German fascists. Churchill openly admitted this in his speech on November 23, 1954. He said that even before the end of World War II, when thousands of Germans were captured, he telegraphed to Field Marshal Montgomery, then Commander-in-Chief of the British Army in Europe, ordering him to "carefully collect and store German weapons so that if the Soviet Union continued to attack and we had to cooperate with German soldiers, we could quickly redistribute them to them." The fact that the United States, Britain, and France supported West German militarism after the war further proved their purpose at that time. However, no matter how passively the Western allies of the United States and Britain worked and even obstructed and sabotaged, the Soviet people and their armed forces finally completed their mission, defeated the Hitler group, and liberated the people of many countries from fascist enslavement. Subsequently, the Soviet Union launched an attack on the Japanese armed forces, cooperating with the Chinese people to defeat Japanese imperialism. In this way, the anti-fascist World War II, with the Soviet Union as the main force, combined with the national liberation movements of the invaded countries, with the certain cooperation of the allied countries and the support of the people of the world, achieved complete victory.

    The victory of the anti-fascist war was another most important contribution of the Soviet Union to the cause of world peace and human progress. Because this victory was related to the fate of all mankind, and the Soviet Union was the main force in achieving victory, the decisive factor in defeating Hitler, liberating the people of many countries in Europe and Asia, enabling mankind to get rid of deep disasters, and saving world civilization. It is impossible to imagine that without the Soviet Union, there would be a victory in the anti-fascist war. Similarly, it is also impossible to imagine that a socialist Soviet Union would be able to withstand such a severe test. The imperialists once hoped that the Soviet Union would be severely damaged in the war and would be unable to recover, and would finally have to accept their domination and enslavement. However, this idea was also shattered. Although it suffered heavy losses and had many difficulties, the Soviet Union was not only not weakened, but the socialist system was more consolidated, its strength was greater, and its international status was also higher. This further proved the superiority of the socialist system and also proved the correctness of the Soviet Union's foreign policy.

    The victory of the Soviet Union's Great Patriotic War was the complete failure of the international imperialism's second armed attack on the Soviet state. This failure of imperialism defeated three of the six major imperialist countries in the world, namely Germany, Japan, and Italy, and greatly weakened the other two, namely Britain and France. In principle, the imperialists should have learned the necessary lessons from this failure of armed attack on the Soviet Union, and sincerely coexist peacefully with the Soviet Union and other newly emerging socialist countries on the basis of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, mutual non-aggression, mutual non-interference in internal affairs, and equality and mutual benefit, and work together for lasting world peace. If so, the peaceful aspirations of the people of the world could be satisfied. Wouldn't this be the best thing for all parties? However, the collapse of German, Italian, and Japanese fascism did not cause the collapse of the reactionary monopoly forces in the major capitalist countries. The international imperialist group, headed by the United States, did not learn the lessons they should have learned from the defeat of fascism. They still adhere to the policy of war and aggression. They are ungrateful and have re-launched the struggle against the Soviet Union and other newly emerging socialist countries. After the war, American imperialism desperately carried out arms expansion and war preparations, created and aggravated international tension, carried out expansion and aggression abroad, and attempted to overwhelm the Soviet Union, China, and other socialist countries with military pressure, political offensives, and economic blockades. The United States built hundreds of military bases and pieced together various military groups, such as the North Atlantic Group, the Southeast Asia Treaty, and the Baghdad Treaty, to surround socialist countries. As early as 1947, the United States announced the Truman Doctrine, followed by the "Marshall Plan," occupied Taiwan in China, launched a war of aggression against Korea, implemented the so-called "liberation" policy towards people's democratic countries, interfered in the internal affairs of Hungary, and promoted the Eisenhower Doctrine in the Middle East. The United States has also consistently opposed arms reduction and the prohibition of atomic weapons, armed West German militarism to re-become an anti-Soviet shock force, and manipulated the United Nations to serve its war and aggression policies. It was the United States' "Cold War" policy that created the international tension and constantly threatened world peace.

    In contrast to the imperialist countries, the Soviet Union remained loyal to its peaceful foreign policy and made tremendous efforts throughout the post-war period to stop the war crisis, maintain world peace, and strive for the relaxation of international tension. The Soviet Union played an important role in handling the problems of the defeated countries and establishing the United Nations organization in accordance with the principles of fairness and democracy. The Soviet Union has always insisted on peaceful coexistence between countries with different systems and advocated the use of peaceful means to resolve all international disputes. From the first UN General Assembly in 1946, the Soviet Union fought for arms reduction, the prohibition of atomic weapons, the removal of military bases and troops in foreign territories, and took the initiative to cancel its military bases abroad and carry out disarmament. The Soviet Union advocated a peaceful solution to the German problem and suggested replacing the existing hostile military groups with a collective security system. The Soviet Union played a major role in stopping the Korean War, restoring peace in Indochina, opposing imperialist interference in Hungary, and stopping the armed attack on Egypt. The Soviet Union's peaceful foreign policy has constantly prevented and disrupted the imperialists' aggressive activities and war plans, achieved a series of great victories, and been enthusiastically supported by the people of the world.

    The Soviet Union's faithfulness to the cause of peace can also be seen from its domestic policy. As soon as World War II ended, the Soviet Union immediately carried out economic reorganization and military demobilization, launched large-scale recovery and construction work, and strived to catch up with and surpass the most developed capitalist countries in terms of per capita product in the shortest historical period. Now, the Soviet Union has successfully completed the two post-war five-year plans, making a big step forward in raising the level of industrial production. The 20th Congress of the CPSU formulated a grand plan for the Soviet Union's communist construction. By 1956, the Soviet Union's industrial output had increased 2.5 times compared with before the war and more than 30 times compared with 1913; agriculture had been unprecedentedly developed and ranked first in the world in terms of mechanization, arable land area, and wheat production. Soviet science is the most advanced in the world in many aspects, and it is the first country to possess the latest scientific achievements such as atomic power stations, intercontinental rockets, and artificial satellites. With the development of production, the material and cultural life of the Soviet people is also constantly improving. After the war and more than ten years of peaceful construction, the unity of all nationalities in the Soviet Union has also been strengthened, and the country is more consolidated than ever. Due to the strength of the Soviet Union's economic and military power, and also due to the Soviet Union's adherence to a peaceful foreign policy, its international status has been unprecedentedly enhanced, becoming a decisive factor in international politics and a strong fortress for striving for lasting peace.

    In the twelve years after the war, the international situation was filled with the struggle between the line of maintaining peace and international cooperation and the line of preparing for war and carrying out aggression. The process and outcome of the struggle are very clear. The line of maintaining peace and international cooperation, represented by the Soviet Union, has won and will win; the line of war and aggression, represented by American imperialism, has failed and will inevitably suffer a final defeat. This is because the line of maintaining peace represents the aspirations of hundreds of millions of people in the world, while only a very small number of monopoly capital groups actively support the line of war and aggression. At the same time, the process and outcome of the struggle show that the forces maintaining peace in the world are growing stronger, while the forces preparing for war and carrying out aggression are constantly weakening. Any clear-headed politician should give a correct assessment of this situation. But the imperialists are blinded by greed, arrogant, and unable to face reality. They always live in an unrealistic dream world. They overestimate their own strength, while underestimating the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, as well as all forces that demand peace and oppose war. They also vainly attempt to impose their will on others with the so-called "position of strength" policy. Therefore, it is not surprising that they are constantly running into walls, being passive, and constantly failing in their foreign activities.

    Due to the new and fundamental changes in the international situation after World War II, the strength of imperialism has been greatly weakened, and the strength of peace and socialism has been greatly enhanced, which has made the Soviet Union's struggle for peace have more favorable international conditions. Here, the most important thing is the victory of the Chinese revolution and the formation of the socialist camp. The victory of the Chinese revolution was the most serious blow to imperialism since the October Revolution and has inestimable significance for world peace and the socialist movement. The consolidated unity and friendly alliance between the two major powers of China and the Soviet Union is a reliable pillar for lasting peace and human progress. In addition, many socialist countries have emerged in Europe and Asia after World War II. Due to the consistency of ideology and struggle goals, the socialist countries have naturally formed a powerful socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, including more than 900 million people, geographically connected. The existence and growth of this camp is not only of great significance for ensuring the independence and security of the socialist countries and their common development, but also of great significance for safeguarding world peace and promoting human progress. As Comrade Khrushchev correctly pointed out at the 20th Congress of the CPSU, due to the existence of this camp, "the forces of peace have found not only moral means but also material means to stop aggression." This is why the imperialists are extremely hostile to this camp. The revolutions and construction of all socialist countries have received the firm support and generous assistance of the Soviet Union. Therefore, the formation, consolidation, and development of the socialist camp is inseparable from the role of the Soviet Union. This is also a huge contribution of the Soviet Union to the cause of world peace and human progress.

    The emergence of many nationally independent countries in Asia and Africa and the upsurge of the national liberation movements in Asian and African countries are also major historical changes that have a profound impact on the development of the international situation. It has fundamentally changed the face of Asia and Africa, making the imperialist colonial system tend to disintegrate. What was originally the reserve force for imperialism to prepare and wage war has now become a force against imperialist aggression, against war, and for peace. In the struggle of the people of Asian and African countries for independence, the Soviet Union's example, its sympathy and support, have played a major role.

    After World War II, the awareness of the people of all countries has been significantly improved. In recent years, the movement to defend peace has become increasingly widespread and in-depth. More and more countries and people are demanding peaceful coexistence. The countries that follow the United States in arms expansion and war preparations have increased their centrifugal tendency towards the United States. The contradictions within the imperialist group, especially between the United States and Britain, have become more acute. The United States, as the leader of international imperialism, its "position of strength" policy has become increasingly bankrupt, its situation has become increasingly isolated, and the truth of its outward strength and inward weakness and its predicament has been fully exposed.

    All of this shows the fundamental changes that have taken place in the international situation in the twelve years after the war. These changes have a profound impact on the development of the future situation. Now, the forces of peace have surpassed the forces of war. It has become more difficult for imperialism to launch a new war. The era when they could do whatever they wanted and run rampant in the world is gone forever. The cause of mankind's struggle for lasting peace has greater hope, and war is no longer inevitable. For thousands of years, people have longed to live and work in a peaceful environment forever, and only now has this wish had the greatest possibility of realization. This is an unprecedented change in human history. The Soviet Union has played the greatest role in promoting this change. The Soviet Union remains the decisive factor in fully realizing mankind's aspiration for lasting peace in the future.

    However, the imperialists, headed by the United States, are unwilling to understand this fundamental change in the international situation, let alone reconcile themselves to their failure. Although their momentum has weakened, they are constantly running into walls, becoming increasingly passive, and constantly failing, they are not only slapping their faces to make themselves look fat, making a show of force, threatening, shouting, deceiving, and blackmailing, but also repeatedly attempting to launch new wars and continue to take risks in order to overwhelm the forces of peace and socialism and restore their golden age. Therefore, they have made many attempts in the post-war period, starting with local wars and creating incidents in order to achieve their goals, such as launching a war of aggression against Korea, the conspiracy to delay and expand the Indochina War, the riot in Berlin in June 1953, the armed attack on Egypt last year, and the Hungarian incident, and recently organizing military intervention in Syria, and so on. But the past few contests have all ended in the failure of imperialism. The conspiracy to invade Syria is also doomed to final failure. Of course, American imperialism will not give up on this. It still insists on the policy of aggression and war, strives to create international tension, and seeks opportunities to instigate new wars. Therefore, although the forces of peace are incomparably strong, the struggle for lasting peace still has to go through a long period of repeated twists and turns. Peace-loving countries and people cannot relax their vigilance against the war conspiracies of imperialism in the slightest. As long as imperialism exists, lasting peace will not come on its own. Peace must be won through struggle.

    Although the Soviet Union adheres to the peace policy and makes the greatest efforts to strive for lasting peace, this is not because it is afraid of war. The Soviet Union believes in the superiority of its own socialist system and the righteousness of maintaining peace, so it has the determination and the strength to defeat any invasion by imperialism. The past smashing of the armed intervention of fourteen countries and the victory over fascist aggression fully demonstrate this. What's more, the current Soviet Union is very different from 1941, let alone compared to 1919. Not only has the Soviet Union's economic and military power become incomparably strong, but also the People's Republic of China and the people's democratic countries stand closely together with it, with the support of the people of the world and the cooperation of the national independence movements against colonialism in Asia and Africa. In the past, American imperialism could rely on its geographical advantage to stay away from the flames of war and profit from it, so it still had a great fluke mentality about war. Now, due to the emergence of atomic and hydrogen weapons, rockets, and jet aircraft, this superior position no longer exists at all. The Soviet Union's advanced position in science and technology, especially its first mastery of intercontinental ballistic missiles and artificial satellites, is

    庆祝伟大的十月社会主义革命四十周年
    为和平奋斗的四十年
    张闻天
    伟大的十月社会主义革命在占全世界六分之一的土地上建立了第一个无产阶级专政的工农国家。这个国家从它的诞生时起，就宣布执行一种历史上没有过的对外政策，从而在国际关系上开辟了一个全新的时代。在任何剥削者的社会里，对外政策都是少数占统治地位的剥削阶级的政策，是他们依靠损害人民群众利益并背着人民群众而推行的自私自利的政策。对于许多资本主义国家说来，对外政策的基本目的就是为了给少数资本家集团夺取更多的领土或“势力范围”以及奴役其他各国人民，取得最有利的条件。马克思和恩格斯曾经指出，“使各地人民互相反对、利用某一民族来压迫另一民族，并以此保证专制政权的继续存在，这就是迄今所有的一切统治者及其外交家的艺术和活动。”但是，十月革命所产生的苏维埃国家却从根本上改变了这种情况。它高举无产阶级国际主义的旗帜，把维护民族平等和独立自由、争取世界和平和国际合作、反对帝国主义的侵略和战争，奉为自己对外政策的指导原则。这样，就在国际关系和对外政策上出现了一个新纪元，在全世界范围内开始了两条路线的斗争。一条是社会主义国家旨在保障世界和平和各国人民之间的友好合作的路线；一条是帝国主义国家旨在准备和发动侵略战争和奴役各国人民的路线。
    争取和平是苏联对外政策的根本方针，这是由于它的社会制度和国家性质决定的。一个国家的对外政策是它的国内政策的延续，并服从和服务于它的国内政策。苏联的对外政策也如同它的国内政策一样，是保护工人阶级及其他劳动人民利益的政策，它的基本目的就在于创造最有利的国际条件以保证国内的社会主义和共产主义建设。列宁在谈到苏维埃国家外交政策的基本任务时曾说过，“我们需要和平建设，我们必须进行和平建设，而且我们将要把我们的所有精力和所有生命贡献给和平建设。”因为只有和平建设，才能大力发展生产，充分实现社会主义生产的目的，满足人民不断增长的物质和文化需要。为此，就要求有一个和平的国际环境，而战争却只能妨碍和破坏建设的进行。同时，社会主义国家由于基本生产资料的公有制和国民经济的有计划发展，根本不会发生生产过剩和经济危机，因而也就不需要像帝国主义那样从战争中去寻找出路，不需要向外进行扩张和争夺市场。苏维埃国家是无产阶级专政的国家，是劳动人民当权的国家，在国内推翻了力图扩大剥削范围和侵占新领土以及依靠军备竞赛获得最大利润的阶级和集团，从而消灭了要求发动战争和进行侵略的根本基础。工人阶级及其他劳动人民是依靠自己劳动生活的，他们的阶级本性就是爱好和平和反对战争的。因为从帝国主义战争中得到利益的只能是少数垄断资本集团，而劳动人民却要担负一切战争重荷，遭受巨大牺牲。因此，无产阶级专政和劳动人民当权，就自然决定了国家对外政策的和平性质。
    作为社会主义国家的苏联的和平政策，是以列宁关于和平共处的理论为基础的。由于帝国主义时期资本主义国家经济和政治发展的不平衡，社会主义革命不可能在所有的国家同时胜利，这就使资本主义国家和社会主义国家同时并存成为不可避免的事情。帝国主义国家虽然一直不死心，但却终于无法消灭社会主义国家，而一再的较量，也都失败了。这表明社会主义是人类历史发展的必然结果，帝国主义不可能把历史的车轮扭向后转。正如列宁所说的，当一个民族的大多数工人和农民觉悟到为劳动者的政权和社会主义事业斗争时，“这样一个民族是永远不可战胜的。”至于社会主义国家，则根据自己所信奉的马克思主义学说，认定革命不能输出，革命与否决定于各国的历史条件，是各国人民自己的事情，并反对对别国内政的任何干涉。而且社会主义国家坚信自己社会制度的优越性，认为在和平竞赛中一定可以取得胜利。因此，根本用不着采取战争的手段。这样，不同社会制度国家间的和平共处，就不仅是可能的，而且成为必然的了。
    这种以和平共处为基本原则的对外政策，不仅符合苏联人民的利益，而且也符合全世界人民的利益。因为需要战争的只是某些国家中的一小撮剥削者集团，而反对战争和争取和平却是一切国家人民的共同愿望。不单是工人阶级取得政权的国家为了进行社会主义和共产主义建设需要和平的国际环境，而且其他所有国家的人民为了保障安全和争取进步也要求生活在和平的条件之下。因此，苏维埃国家的和平外交政策，是真正的人民外交政策，它得到了本国人民的坚决支持和全世界人民的广泛拥护。全世界争取和平的斗争第一次有了国家这样强有力的工具，有了一个真正维护和平的大国来带头。这就使争取持久和平和国际合作的斗争进入了一个新阶段。各国人民把苏维埃国家看成是它们维护和平和安全的可靠堡垒和光荣旗手，是有充分理由的。
    苏联存在的四十年，就是为和平奋斗的四十年。四十年来，苏联在每一个时期都对和平事业有着巨大的贡献，并且也获得了辉煌的成就。虽然好战的帝国主义集团一直梦想扑灭它，但这一和平堡垒却不仅没有被消灭，反而以飞快的速度日益发展和壮大起来。世界和平的保持同苏联的存在和强大，已经完全联系在一起了。
    十月革命对世界和平事业的贡献是无可估量的。还在十月革命爆发后的第二天，全俄工兵苏维埃代表大会就通过了列宁起草的著名“和平法令”，正式建议各交战国停止战争，立刻缔结不要求兼并和割地赔款的全面、公正而民主的和约，并宣布帝国主义战争为反人类的莫大罪行，号召各国人民亲自起来争取和平。虽然各帝国主义列强都对此置诸不理，但是苏维埃国家仍坚持进行和平的努力，并终于使俄国退出了战争。这对于希望继续血腥屠杀的帝国主义集团是一个极为严重的打击。当时苏维埃国家的和平政策和行动，在国际上发生了巨大的影响，把争取和平的斗争引向高潮。各国人民已经以具体行动起来反对战争和争取和平了。同时，十月革命的胜利和苏维埃国家所宣布执行的民族平等政策、主张民族自决以及主动放弃帝俄对中国等东方国家的不平等条约的行动，也大大促进了被压迫民族的觉醒，许多殖民地、半殖民地人民为争取独立自由和反对帝国主义奴役而掀起了壮阔的民族革命运动。所有这些，都使帝国主义的后方更加不稳和动摇，战争已很难再打下去了。第一次世界大战，终于停止了。这样，苏维埃国家就以它的和平努力及其影响，缩短了第一次世界大战的时间，制止了帝国主义的大屠杀，从而对于世界和平和人类文明建立了历史性的功勋。
    国际帝国主义对十月革命的胜利和苏维埃社会主义国家的成立表现了最大的不安和仇恨。他们害怕社会主义国家的存在和发展会成为他们本国人民及殖民地、半殖民地人民进行革命和解放斗争的榜样，害怕社会主义国家作为和平堡垒会阻碍他们推行侵略和战争政策。因此他们极力企图，如像丘吉尔所公开承认的，把苏维埃国家扼死在它的摇篮里。十月革命一爆发，帝国主义列强就立刻着手准备和实行反苏的武装干涉。在这件事情上，美帝国主义起了主导的作用。它利用在战争中发了大财的经济力量，对一切反苏的势力都给予广泛的金钱援助和物资供应，后来更直接派自己的军队侵入了苏维埃国家的领土。第一次世界大战刚结束，美、英、法等帝国主义国家就组织和发动了十四国的武装干涉，以期摧毁苏维埃政权，最后瓜分俄国。但是，这些企图并没有能够得逞。社会主义国家虽然反对战争，主张和平，但是，正如恩格斯远在1844年就曾指出的，在自卫战争的场合下，这个社会的成员“一定会保卫真正的祖国，真正的家园”，因此他们“将热情焕发、坚毅勇敢地作战，使受过机械化训练的现代军队也要望风披靡”。事实上也正是这样。经过了将近三年的英勇斗争，苏联各族人民在光荣的苏联共产党的领导之下，终于把帝国主义的武装干涉给完全粉碎了。反对武装干涉的胜利，不仅保卫了年轻的社会主义国家，而且也拯救了世界和平。这是苏联对和平事业的又一重大贡献。
    在反对武装干涉者的斗争中，苏联的和平外交政策发挥了巨大的作用。列宁说，“为和平而战，我们是用了极大毅力来进行的。”“在这一战线上，我们表现得很有本事，至少也不比红军流血战线上的活动坏些。”苏维埃政府不断揭穿武装干涉者的侵略目的和罪行，赢得了各国人民的普遍同情和广泛支持，他们用具体行动援助俄国人民，拉住了干涉者的后腿。苏维埃政府充分利用了帝国主义阵营的一切矛盾，用自己的和平政策分化了敌人，争取了邻国。到1921年春，它已同周围的八个国家先后订立了和平条约。因此，反对武装干涉的胜利，充分证明了工农政权的优越性和苏维埃社会主义制度的优越性，同时也证明了和平外交政策的优越性。
    但是，武装干涉的失败并没有使帝国主义者清醒过来，他们仍然坚持着消灭苏联的目的。在武装干涉失败之后，他们对苏联又采取了政治上孤立，经济上封锁，军事上施加压力、恐吓和讹诈，以及在内部支持反革命势力、组织颠覆破坏活动等一系列的措施。在这些方面起主导作用的仍然是美帝国主义。它虽然第一个承认了十月革命前的反动的俄国临时政府，但却一直闭着眼睛不承认苏联。正如同在对中国的态度上，它是以前最先承认蒋介石反动政府的国家，而现在却又坚持不承认中华人民共和国一样。国际帝国主义者的这些阴谋，无疑地给当时的苏联人民造成了一定的困难。但是，掌握了自己命运的、站起来了的人民是不可战胜的，这些困难并没有把苏联人民吓倒。苏联人民在苏联共产党的领导下，克服了这些困难，巩固了自己的内部，冲破了帝国主义的封锁，使苏联变得更加强大了，在国际上的地位也显著提高了。由于苏联的巩固和壮大，也由于帝国主义阵营内部矛盾和困难的加深，当时的协约国家已经不得不还在1922年初的加纳会议上事实上承认苏联的平等地位。而随着贸易关系的逐渐正常化，也就必然走向外交关系的建立。英法等大多数资本主义国家终于在苏联建国后的七年左右正式承认了苏联，最顽固的美帝国主义也不得不在十六年后同苏联建立正常的外交关系。帝国主义长期把苏联排斥在外的国际联盟，也不能不在十七年后主动邀请苏联参加。这样，帝国主义对苏联所采取的政治上孤立、经济上封锁、以及搞颠覆破坏的政策，和武装干涉的结果一样，也完全失败了。
    在这个时期内，苏联外交在为同各国建立正常的政治和经济关系、为维护世界和平作了一系列的重大努力。在1922年的热那亚会议上，苏维埃代表团即根据列宁的指示，提出了普遍裁军的建议。同年末，苏维埃政府又提议在莫斯科召开了有波兰和波罗的海沿岸各国参加的裁军会议。1924年，苏联克服了美国的阻挠和破坏，同欧亚的多数国家建立了外交关系。1927年，苏联参加了日内瓦军缩会议筹委会会议，并提出了自己的积极建议。1928年，苏联加入了非战公约。为了维护和平和打破帝国主义建立反苏同盟的阴谋，从1925年到1933年，苏联先后同土耳其、德国、伊朗、波兰、法国、意大利等十一个国家订立了互不侵犯条约或中立条约。苏联这一时期在外交上的各种努力，进一步巩固了自己的地位，维护了本国的独立，并争取到了国际关系中的平等地位。同时这对保卫世界和平、揭露帝国主义的侵略和备战阴谋、打乱它们的步骤和计划，都起了巨大的作用。坚持和平政策的苏联，日益成为帝国主义进行侵略和发动战争的一个主要障碍了。
    苏联能够对和平事业作出重大贡献，是同苏联国力的日益强大分不开的。经过国民经济的恢复时期和两个五年计划的建设，苏联已实现了国家的工业化和农业的集体化，完成了文化革命，消灭了剥削阶级，建成了社会主义社会。到1939年，苏联在工业总产量上就已由革命前的世界第五位和欧洲第四位变成世界第二位和欧洲第一位，超过了除美国外的一切资本主义国家。这种发展速度是资本主义根本梦想不到的。这就非常有力地显示了社会主义制度的优越性。随着苏联社会制度和国家力量的巩固和壮大，它的国际影响更加增长，国际地位也更加提高了，从而也大大加强了保卫世界和平的力量。因此，苏联社会主义建设的胜利，乃是对世界和平和人类进步事业的巨大贡献。
    在第二次世界大战前，苏联为了防止战争和争取集体安全作了一系列的努力。苏联在1935年分别同法国、捷克斯洛伐克等国订立了互助公约，并准备给那些遭受侵略威胁的国家以军事援助。但是这些努力并没有成功。因为当时国际帝国主义，特别是美国的垄断资本集团，都有着另外的打算，这就是竭力扶持德、意、日军国主义势力，企图使之充当进攻苏联的突击队。他们把最大的希望寄托在组织反苏战争上，以便既可破坏苏联的社会主义建设以至消灭这一人类进步的灯塔和和平堡垒，又可缓和帝国主义内部的矛盾和危机。因此，它们从1924年起，就根据“道威斯计划”向德国提供大量的长期和短期投资，为恢复德国军事工业潜力和武装德国建立经济基础；1925年又以“洛迦诺条约”为吸引德国参加反苏阴谋创造必需的政治条件；后来更扶持德国法西斯上台和怂恿日本侵占中国的东北，从而在东方和西方造成了两个战争策源地。当日本加紧侵略中国，意大利侵占阿比西尼亚，德意干涉西班牙，德国出兵莱茵非武装区和兼并奥地利的时候，苏联即积极揭露和谴责侵略者，在道义上和物质上援助被侵略的国家，例如支援西班牙，同中国订立互不侵犯条约并帮助中国抗日等。同时它还一再建议同美、英、法等国一起采取必要措施以制止侵略，并在大战的前夕，同英、法进行了四个多月的谈判，希望建立集体安全制度，防止大战的爆发。但是美、英、法各国的统治集团却坚持所谓“不干涉政策”和“绥靖政策”，用牺牲中国和欧洲某些小国的办法，为缔结了“反共协定”和“三国轴心”的德、意、日进攻苏联廓清道路。因此，它们对日本侵略中国不但不加干涉，而且还在物资上予以援助；对德、意法西斯则执行臭名昭彰的“慕尼黑政策”，纵容、挑拨和扩大战争。正如毛主席在“苏联利益和人类利益的一致”一文中所说，“英、美、法各国政府，并无诚意制止大战的爆发；相反，它们是促成了大战的爆发。”“英美法的计划是：推动德国进攻苏联，它们自己‘坐山观虎斗’，让苏、德打得精疲力竭之后，它们出来收拾时局。”这一分析后来被美国反动集团的代言人杜鲁门的供认所证实了。他在1941年6月曾声明说，“如果我们看到德国胜利，我们就应当帮助俄国；但如果俄国胜利，我们就应当帮助德国，这样，让他们厮杀不已，杀得越多越好。”但是，历史的发展并不按照帝国主义者的愿望。由于互相竞争的垄断集团的利益超过了阶级利益，也由于英法本身的软弱和苏联的强大，以及为了保障自己反苏战争的后方安全，希特勒德国却首先发动了对法国和英国的进攻。苏联本着和平的外交政策，不仅为维护和平奋斗到了最后一刻，而且当战争已在所难免的时候又以苏德互不侵犯条约粉碎了美英法推动德国进攻苏联的阴谋。这就为苏联赢得了一个时期的和平和准备力量回击敌人的可能。这也表明了苏联对和平事业的忠诚和它的和平政策的优越性。
    第二次世界大战对苏联是一次严酷的考验。由美英法扶植起来的希特勒德国，在侵占和奴役了欧洲十一个国家之后，就乘其战胜余威背信弃义地大举进攻苏联，企图以闪电战在短期内征服苏联。不仅是法西斯，而且美英统治阶级中许多人物也都预言着苏联的迅速崩溃。但是事实又相反，苏联人民在苏联共产党的领导下，掀起了伟大的卫国战争，英勇地粉碎了希特勒德国和它的支持者的阴谋和妄想。由于苏联已经完成了国家工业化、农业集体化和文化上的革命，肃清了国内的反革命分子，并且在战前作了充分的自卫准备，因此已完全有力量抵挡住法西斯的侵略。苏联卫国战争的目的，不仅是要拯救自己的祖国，而且还要解放那些在德国法西斯奴役下的各国人民。正是由于苏联的参战，才决定了第二次世界大战的民主的和解放的性质。在卫国战争时期，苏联外交光辉地完成了建立反法西斯同盟和孤立法西斯集团的任务，对于取得战争的胜利发挥了巨大的作用。在德国法西斯进攻苏联后，反法西斯同盟即开始成立，到1941年9月苏、英、美莫斯科会议时这一同盟的联合行动纲领就已确定了。但就是在这种情况下，美英帝国主义者仍然打算用牺牲苏联来改善自己的境遇，并指望他们的德国竞争者在战争中削弱，而苏联也一蹶不振，那时他们便可迫使双方接受他们的和平条件。因此，虽然在签订苏英同盟条约和随后发表的苏美公报中，都曾确定美、英要在1942年在欧洲开辟第二战场，但是它们却不履行自己承担的义务，而以种种借口进行拖延。直到1944年6月，当苏联已经大规模反攻、当苏联能够单独击败法西斯德国并解放欧洲被奴役的各国人民的形势已经完全明显了的时候，美英才派军队在法国登陆，而且还把注意力集中到向巴尔干的渗入上。当时美英在欧洲登陆的目的，与其说是为了援助苏联打垮法西斯德国，毋宁说是为了把欧洲尽可能多的地方置于自己的影响之下，拯救欧洲许多国家的资本主义使之免于崩溃，阻止苏军对法西斯的追击，并保存德国军国主义的残余力量以便将来再次充当它们的反苏突击队。因此，第二战场开辟后，美英军队并不积极进行对德作战，甚至还企图同德国法西斯合作。丘吉尔在1954年11月23日的演说中，对此曾直供不讳。他说，还在第二次世界大战结束前，当成千上万的德国人被俘的时候，他曾打电报给当时的欧洲英军总司令蒙哥马利元帅，命令他“把德国武器仔细收集并储存起来，以便如果苏联继续进攻，而我们必须同德国兵合作的时候，能够很迅速地再分发给他们。”战后美英法扶植西德军国主义的事实，更加证明了它们当时所抱的目的。但是，不管美英这些西方盟国如何消极怠工甚至阻挠破坏，苏联人民及其武装力量终于完成了自己的使命，击溃了希特勒集团，把许多国家的人民从法西斯奴役下解放了出来。随后，苏联又发起了对日本武装力量的攻击，配合中国人民打垮了日本帝国主义。反法西斯的第二次世界大战，就这样，以苏联为主力，结合被侵略国家的民族解放运动，在各盟国的一定配合和全世界人民的支持下，取得了完全的胜利。
    反法西斯战争的胜利，是苏联对世界和平和人类进步事业的又一次最重大的贡献。因为，这一胜利关系着全人类的命运，苏联则是取得胜利的主力，是打垮希特勒、解放欧亚许多国家人民，使人类摆脱深重灾难和拯救世界文明的决定性因素。不能设想，没有苏联，会有反法西斯战争的胜利。同样地也不能设想，不是社会主义的苏联，能够经得住这样一个严峻的考验。帝国主义者曾经指望苏联在战争中遭到严重破坏而一蹶不振，最后不得不接受他们的支配和奴役。但是，这种想法又落空了。虽然遭受了重大的损失，有着不少的困难，苏联不仅没有削弱，而且社会主义制度更巩固了，力量更强大了，国际地位也更提高了。这就更加证明了社会主义制度的优越性，同时也证明了苏联对外政策的正确。
    苏联伟大卫国战争的胜利，是国际帝国主义对苏维埃国家第二次武装进攻的彻底失败。帝国主义的这次失败，使世界上原有的六大帝国主义国家中的三个，即德、日、意被打倒了，另两个即英、法，也大大地削弱了。按理，帝国主义者从这次武装进攻苏联的失败中应该取得必要的教训，诚心诚意地在互相尊重主权和领土完整，互不侵犯、互不干涉内政和平等互利的基础上，同苏联和其他社会主义国家和平共处，并且为世界持久和平而共同努力。如果那样，世界人民的和平愿望就可以得到满足。这岂不是对各方都有利的最好的事情？但是，德、意、日法西斯的溃灭，并没有造成主要资本主义国家反动的垄断势力的溃灭。以美国为首的国际帝国主义集团却并没有从法西斯的失败中取得应有的教训。他们仍然坚持战争和侵略政策。他们忘恩负义，重新展开了反对苏联和其他新出现的社会主义国家的斗争。美帝国主义在战后拼命进行扩军备战，制造和加剧国际紧张局势，对外实行扩张和侵略，并企图用军事压力、政治攻势、经济封锁等手段压倒苏联、中国和其他社会主义国家。美国建立成百的军事基地，拼凑各种军事集团，如北大西洋集团、东南亚条约、巴格达条约等来包围社会主义国家。还在1947年，美国就宣布了杜鲁门主义，随后更有“马歇尔计划”，侵占中国台湾，发动侵略朝鲜的战争，对人民民主国家执行所谓“解放”政策，干涉匈牙利内政，在中东推行艾森豪威尔主义等一连串事件的发生。美国还一直反对裁减军备和禁止原子武器，武装西德的军国主义使之重新成为反苏的突击力量，并操纵联合国为它的战争和侵略政策服务。正是美国的“冷战”政策，才造成了国际上的紧张局势，使世界和平不时受到威胁。
    同帝国主义国家相反，苏联仍然忠于自己的和平外交政策，在整个战后时期，为制止战争危机、维护世界和平和争取国际紧张局势的缓和，作了巨大的努力。苏联在根据公平、民主原则处理战败国问题和建立联合国组织上，发挥了重要的作用。苏联一直坚持不同制度国家间实行和平共处，主张用和平方式解决一切国际纠纷。从1946年的第一届联合国大会起，苏联就为裁减军备、禁止原子武器、撤除在外国领土上的军事基地和驻军而斗争，并主动取消了自己在国外的军事基地和进行了裁军。苏联主张和平解决德国问题，建议以集体安全制度代替现有的各种敌对性军事集团。在停止朝鲜战争、恢复印度支那和平、反对帝国主义对匈牙利的干涉和制止对埃及的武装进攻等问题上，苏联都起了重大的作用。苏联的和平外交政策不断地阻止和打乱了帝国主义者的侵略活动和战争计划，获得了一连串的伟大胜利，受到全世界人民的热烈拥护。
    苏联忠实于和平事业，也可以从它的国内政策上看出来。第二次世界大战刚一结束，苏联就立即进行了经济改组和军队复员，展开了大规模的恢复和建设工作，为实现在最短的历史时期内在按人口计算的产品方面赶上并超过最发达的资本主义国家的任务而努力。现在，苏联已胜利地完成了战后的两个五年计划，使工业生产水平提高了一大步。苏共第二十次代表大会，更为苏联的共产主义建设制订了宏伟的计划。到1956年为止，苏联的工业产量比战前增加二点五倍，比1913年增加了三十余倍；农业已得到了空前的发展，在机械化程度、耕地面积以及小麦产量等上已占居世界第一位。苏联的科学在许多方面都是世界上最先进的，它是第一个拥有原子电站、洲际火箭、人造卫星等这些科学上最新成就的国家。随着生产的发展，苏联人民的物质和文化生活也在不断地提高。经过战争和战后十余年的和平建设，苏联各族人民的团结也更加强了，国家比任何时候都要巩固。由于苏联经济力量和军事力量的强大，也由于苏联坚持执行和平的外交政策，它的国际地位已空前地提高了，成为国际政治中的决定性因素，成为争取持久和平的坚强堡垒。
      战后十二年内，国际上充满了维护和平和国际合作的路线同准备战争和进行侵略的路线之间的斗争。斗争的过程及其结局是很明显的。以苏联为代表的维护和平和国际合作的路线胜利了，而且还要胜利；以美帝国主义为代表的战争和侵略路线失败了，而且必将遭到最后失败。这是因为维护和平的路线代表着全世界亿万人民的愿望，而积极支持战争和侵略路线的却只有人数极少的垄断资本集团。同时，斗争的过程和结局表明，世界维护和平的力量是在日益壮大，而准备战争和进行侵略的力量却在不断削弱。对于这种形势，任何头脑清醒的政治家，都理应给以正确的估计。但是帝国主义者却利令智昏，狂妄自大，不能正视现实。他们始终生活在不现实的幻想境界里。他们过高估计了自己的力量，而对苏联和其他社会主义国家以及一切要求和平和反对战争的力量，则估计不足。他们还妄想用所谓“实力地位”政策，把自己的意志强加于人。因此，他们在对外活动上，处处碰壁、经常被动、不断失败，当然也就不足为奇了。
    由于第二次世界大战后国际形势发生了新的根本的变化，帝国主义的力量大大削弱了，和平和社会主义的力量大大增强了，这就使苏联争取和平的斗争有了更为有利的国际条件。在这里，最重要的是中国革命的胜利和社会主义阵营的形成。中国革命的胜利是继十月革命后给予帝国主义最严重的一次打击，对世界和平和社会主义运动有无可估量的意义。中苏两大国的巩固团结和友好同盟，是持久和平和人类进步事业的可靠支柱。此外，第二次世界大战后在欧亚两洲还出现了许多社会主义国家。由于思想体系和奋斗目标的一致，各社会主义国家就自然形成了一个以苏联为首的，包括九亿多人口，在地理上连成一片的、强大的社会主义阵营。这个阵营的存在和壮大，不仅对于保证各社会主义国家的独立和安全以及它们的共同发展有重大的意义，而且对于保卫世界和平和推动人类进步事业也有重大的意义。正像赫鲁晓夫同志在苏共第二十次代表大会上所正确指出的，由于有了这个阵营的存在，“和平力量不仅找到道义上的手段而且也找到物质的手段来阻止侵略。”这就是为什么帝国主义者极端仇视这个阵营的原因。各社会主义国家的革命和建设都得到了苏联的坚决支持和慷慨援助。因此，社会主义阵营的形成、巩固和发展，是同苏联的作用分不开的。这也是苏联对世界和平和人类进步事业的巨大贡献。
    亚非许多民族独立国家的出现和亚非各国民族解放运动的高涨，也是一个历史性的重大变化，对国际形势的发展有着深远的影响。它根本上改变了亚非的面貌，使帝国主义的殖民体系趋于瓦解。原来是帝国主义准备和进行战争的后备力量，现在却成为反对帝国主义侵略、反对战争和争取和平的力量了。在亚非各国人民争取独立的斗争中，苏联的榜样，它的同情和支持，都起了重大的作用。
    第二次世界大战以后，各国人民的觉悟有了显著的提高。近年来，保卫和平的运动已日益走向广泛和深入。要求和平共处的国家和人民越来越多了。追随美国扩军备战的国家，增加了对美国的离心倾向。帝国主义集团内部，特别是美英之间的矛盾也更加尖锐了。作为国际帝国主义领袖的美国，它的“实力地位”政策已日趋破产，处境愈益孤立，外强中干和进退维谷的真相也充分暴露了。
    所有这一切，都表明了战后十二年内国际形势所发生的根本变化。这些变化对今后形势的发展有着深远的影响。现在，和平的力量已经超过了战争的力量。帝国主义要发动一次新的大战已经更加困难了。他们在全世界为所欲为、横行霸道的时代已经一去不复返了。人类争取持久和平的事业已经有了更大的希望，战争不再是不可避免的了。几千年来，人们都是渴望着能够永远在和平的环境中生活和劳动，只是到了现在，这种愿望才有了实现的最大可能。这是人类历史上破天荒的变化。在促成这一变化上，苏联起了最大的作用。在今后完全实现人类持久和平的愿望上，苏联仍然是决定性的因素。
    但是，以美国为首的帝国主义不愿意了解国际形势的这种根本变化，更不甘心于它们的失败。尽管他们气势已弱，经常碰壁，日益被动，不断失败，他们却不但在打肿腮膀装胖子，虚张声势，威胁叫嚣，欺骗讹诈，而且还一再企图发动新的战争，继续进行冒险，以便把和平和社会主义的力量压倒，恢复他们的黄金时代。因此，战后时期他们曾作过许多次的尝试，并从局部战争和制造事件的办法着手，以期达到自己的目的，如发动侵略朝鲜的战争，拖延和扩大印度支那战争的阴谋，1953年6月在柏林搞暴动，去年武装进攻埃及和制造匈牙利事件，最近又在组织对叙利亚的军事干涉，等等。但是过去的几次较量，都是以帝国主义的失败而告终的。侵略叙利亚的阴谋也注定要遭到最后的失败。当然，美帝国主义是不会就此罢休的。它还坚持侵略和战争的政策，竭力制造国际紧张局势，并寻隙策动新的战争。因此，虽然和平力量已无比强大，但争取持久和平仍然要经过长期的反复曲折的斗争。爱好和平的国家和人民，对帝国主义的战争阴谋不能丝毫放松警惕。当帝国主义还存在的时候，持久和平是不会自己到来的。和平必须用斗争去争取。
    苏联虽然坚持和平政策，为争取持久和平尽着最大的努力，但是这并不是因为它害怕战争。苏联相信自己社会主义制度的优越性，相信维护和平的正义性，因此有决心、也有力量打败帝国主义的任何进犯。过去粉碎十四国的武装干涉和战胜法西斯的侵略，就充分说明了这一点。何况现在的苏联已经同1941年大不相同，更不能同1919年相比了。不但苏联的经济力量和军事力量已经无比强大，而且还有中华人民共和国和各人民民主国家同它紧密地站在一起，有全世界人民的支持，有亚非各国反殖民主义的民族独立运动的配合。过去，美帝国主义还可依赖它在地理上的优越性，使自己远离战火，从中取利，因而对战争还存在着很大的侥幸心理。现在由于原子和氢武器、火箭及喷气飞机等的出现，这种优越地位已经根本不存在了。苏联在科学技术上的先进地位，特别是首先掌握了洲际弹道导弹和人造卫星，对帝国主义侵略者是一个严重的警告。企图用战争吓倒苏联和各国人民，完全是一小撮帝国主义者的幻想，实际上是一点作用也没有的。因此，如果帝国主义侵略集团胆敢发动反对社会主义国家的战争，那么可以肯定，整个资本主义体系都将走向彻底的崩溃。因此，苏联人民和全世界进步人类一道，正在满怀信心，瞻望将来，向着持久和平和共产主义的光辉前途迈进。
    苏联和平外交政策所取得的成就，充分说明了社会主义制度的优越性，以及由这种制度所产生的和平政策的优越性。四十年来，苏联对和平事业作了巨大的贡献。从这里也可以看出，伟大的十月社会主义革命对于世界和平和人类进步的重大影响。
    让我们对为世界持久和平和人类进步事业作出如此巨大贡献的苏联人民，苏联共产党，苏联政府，表示我们崇高的敬意和衷心的感谢。让中苏两国人民永远紧紧地团结在一起，为世界持久和平和人类进步的伟大事业而奋斗到底！
