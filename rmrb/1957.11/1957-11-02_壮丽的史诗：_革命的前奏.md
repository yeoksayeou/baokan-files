    Magnificent Epic: "Prelude to Revolution"
    Zhang Youjun
    The Russian Revolution of 1905 was an important stage in the people's revolution against the brutal rule of the Russian Tsar. It was the prelude to the October Socialist Revolution, the overture to the October Socialist Revolution. Soviet film artists have now recreated the thrilling events that took place during this historical stage on the screen through artistic means.
    This is the film "Prelude to Revolution" being screened at the Soviet Film Week.
    "Prelude to Revolution" begins by portraying the "Bloody Sunday" event of January 9, 1905 on a grand scale. The film's screenwriter, A. Stein, wrote the truth of history: through a series of plots, such as the Tsarist Russian police using the treacherous Father Gapon for deception, the activities of secret agents, and the warnings of the Bolsheviks to the workers, it is clearly pointed out that freedom can never be obtained by petitioning the Tsar, but must be fought for by one's own strength. However, at that time, a large number of workers still believed Father Gapon's words, thinking that the Tsar would sympathize with the people's suffering and grant their requests. Therefore, on January 9th, thousands of workers in St. Petersburg, along with their families, carrying banners and portraits of the Tsar, went to the Winter Palace to petition. As a result, the Tsar ordered the army to open fire on the workers and their families, causing a tragic incident in which more than 3,000 people were killed or wounded.
    Based on the material provided by the playwright, director E. Gigan fully utilized the characteristics of widescreen (while also producing standard screen copies) film and sound effects to handle the "Bloody Sunday" event. When handling crowd scenes, Gigan was able to highlight the main characters and capture individual dramatic details to infect the audience. Anyone who has seen this film will never forget the old worker Kruglov from the Putilov factory and his young daughter, and how this innocent little girl died under the bullets of the Tsar's army! People will also not forget the blind newspaper seller walking towards the army's gun muzzles in the chaos. What crime did these people commit? However, the Tsar's poisonous hand did not spare them. While exposing the Tsar's brutal face, the director also highlighted the image of the revolutionary Martha, who appeared face to face with the soldier Filimonov on the screen. Her brief words initially touched the heartstrings of this soldier from a peasant background. Filimonov's gun trembled! From Filimonov, we can see the awakening of a part of the people in the Tsar's army.
    The first to awaken were the workers. The blood in front of the Winter Palace washed away their last illusions about the Tsar. They said, "How the Tsar treats us, we will treat him the same way!" The Tsar's bloody suppression did not intimidate the workers; on the contrary, the workers' movement developed further.
    At that time, Lenin, who was in Geneva, estimated this event as the beginning of the revolution. He instructed Fiodor, who came from St. Petersburg: "Combat teams should be organized immediately, not a minute or an hour should be missed..." The appearance of Lenin's immortal image greatly increased the film's vitality. The film also showed Lenin's return to the country and arranged for Lenin to stay at the home of the worker Kruglov. And Kruglov's resolute actions to protect Lenin's safety fully demonstrated that his thoughts and feelings had turned to the Bolshevik side.
    The spies in the film are foolish and greedy. The playwright's pen strokes are written with feelings of disgust and contempt towards them. The actors playing the secret agents also vividly portrayed the shameful faces of the Tsar's lackeys. On the other hand, the playwright also wrote about the process of the intellectual Ignaty degenerating into a traitor to the revolution. This character should be a mirror for the right-wing elements in our country today.
    The scene of the Moscow workers' armed uprising was handled as successfully as the Winter Palace petition, and the Moscow uprising was particularly encouraging, showing the audience a series of intense battle scenes. Those who participated in the battle were the working masses fighting for freedom and liberation, and later joined by uprising soldiers like Filimonov. The Tsar mobilized troops from St. Petersburg and the western border, exceeding the number of insurgents by several times, and used artillery to bombard the barricades built by the working masses. The fire was burning fiercely, and the insurgents finally failed. However, the failure of this uprising was not the extinguishing of the revolutionary spark, but the sowing of more sparks. The film vividly praises the revolutionary heroes who persisted in fighting to the end. On the screen where blood and fire reflect each other, the audience once again saw the familiar figures of Fiodor, Martha, Varvara, Filimonov, and Katya, closely concerned about their fate and the success or failure of the revolution. Here, the producers of the film "Prelude to Revolution" wrote a heroic poem with outstanding artistic conception and skill.
    After portraying the Moscow uprising, the film immediately showed the ranks of workers, peasants, sailors, and soldiers attacking the Winter Palace under Lenin's call, with armored vehicles with red flags, and finally, amidst shouts of victory, the sailors raised the red flag on the roof of the Winter Palace...
    The revolutionary struggle that began in 1905 was completed by the October Revolution. Human history has since begun a new era. Today, when we greet the fortieth anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution with enthusiasm, watching "Prelude to Revolution" will undoubtedly give us a deeper understanding, and we will be greatly educated by the profound and broad historical scenes depicted in the film and the proletariat's struggle to dedicate themselves to the truth.

    壮丽的史诗：“革命的前奏”
    张又君
    1905年的俄国革命是反抗俄国沙皇残酷统治的人民革命中的一个重要阶段。它是十月社会主义革命的前奏曲，是十月社会主义革命的序幕。苏联电影艺术家现在把这个历史阶段中所发生的激动人心的事件，通过艺术手段，在银幕上再现出来了。
    这就是在苏联电影周放映的影片“革命的前奏”。
    “革命的前奏”一开始，就用巨大的规模表现了1905年1月9日“流血星期日”事件。影片编剧A·史坦因写出了历史的真实：通过沙俄警察机关利用奸细加邦牧师进行蒙骗、暗探的活动，一直到布尔什维克党人对工人的警告等一系列情节，明确指出自由决不能用向沙皇请愿的方法获得，而是要靠自己的力量去争取的。但是，当时有很大一部分工人还是相信了加邦牧师的话，以为沙皇会体恤民间疾苦，答应他们的请求。因此，在1月9日这一天，成千上万的彼得堡工人，和家人一起，带着旗幡和沙皇像，到冬宫去请愿。结果沙皇命令军队开枪射击工人和家属，造成死伤三千多人的惨案。
    在剧作者提供的材料的基础上，导演E·吉甘充分利用了宽银幕（同时也摄制了普通银幕拷贝）电影的特性和音响效果来处理“流血星期日”事件。吉甘在处理群众场面的时候，能够突出主要人物，抓住个别戏剧性的细节来感染观众。看过这部影片的人，一定忘不了普梯洛夫工厂的老工人克鲁格洛夫和他的小女儿，以及这个天真无邪的小女孩怎样死在沙皇军队的枪弹下！人们也不会忘记在混乱中朝着军队枪口走去的瞎卖报人。这些人有什么罪呢？可是，沙皇的毒手并没有放过他们。在暴露沙皇凶残面目的同时，导演也突出了革命者玛尔法的形象，她同士兵费里蒙诺夫面对面地出现在画面上。她的简短的几句话，最初触动了这个农民出身的士兵的心弦。费里蒙诺夫手上的枪颤抖了！从费里蒙诺夫的身上，我们看出了沙皇军队里的一部分人的觉醒。
    首先觉醒的还是工人。冬宫前面广场上的鲜血冲去了他们对沙皇的最后一点幻想，他们说：“沙皇怎样对付我们，我们也怎么对付他！”沙皇的血腥镇压没有慑服工人，相反的，工人运动更加向前发展了。
    当时正在日内瓦的列宁把这个事件估计为革命的开始。他指示从彼得堡来的菲道尔：“马上应该组织战斗的队伍，不能错过一点钟一分钟……”。列宁这个不朽的形象的出现，大大增加了影片的生命力。影片还表现了列宁的回国，并且把列宁安排到工人克鲁格洛夫的家里。而克鲁格洛夫坚决保护列宁的安全的行动，也充分表现出他的思想感情已经转到布尔什维克这一方面来了。
    影片里的密探，愚妄而又贪婪，剧作者的笔触是蘸着憎恶和轻蔑的感情来写他们的。扮演暗探的演员，也维妙维肖地刻划出了沙皇豢养下的走狗的可耻的嘴脸。另一方面，剧作者也写了一个知识分子依格纳吉堕落为革命叛徒的过程。这个人物对于今天我国的右派分子，应该是一面镜子。
    莫斯科工人武装起义的场面，被处理得同冬宫请愿一样成功，而莫斯科起义更特别具有鼓舞力量，它展示给观众一连串激烈战斗的画面。参加战斗的是争取自由解放的工人群众，后来还加入了起义的士兵如费里蒙诺夫这样的人。沙皇从彼得堡和西方边疆调动来超过起义者数倍的军队，用大炮猛轰工人群众筑起的街垒。烈火在燃烧，起义者终于失败了。但是，这一次起义的失败并不是革命火种的熄灭，而是播下了更多的火种。影片那样鲜明地歌颂了坚持战斗到最后的革命英雄们，观众在血火交相辉映的画面上，又一次看到了菲道尔、玛尔法、瓦尔瓦拉、费里蒙诺夫、卡嘉这些熟悉的人物，密切关心着他们的命运，关心着革命的成败。影片“革命的前奏”的制作者在这里以卓越的艺术构思和技巧，写出了一首英雄的诗篇。
    影片在表现了莫斯科起义以后，紧接着就出现了在列宁号召下向冬宫进攻的工人、农民、水兵、士兵的队伍，出现了插着红旗的铁甲车，最后是在胜利的呼喊中，水兵在冬宫的屋顶上竖起了红旗……。
    1905年开始的革命战斗，到十月革命是完成了。人类历史从此开始了新纪元。今天，当我们怀着热烈的心情，迎接十月社会主义革命四十周年纪念的时候，去看“革命的前奏”，无疑地会有更深的体会，而且会从影片所表现的深刻而广阔的历史场面和无产阶级为真理献身的斗争中，受到极大的教育。
