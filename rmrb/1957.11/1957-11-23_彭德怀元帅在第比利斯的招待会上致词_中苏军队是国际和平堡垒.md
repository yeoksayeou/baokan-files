Xinhua News Agency, November 22nd: According to TASS reports: The Chinese military goodwill delegation headed by Marshal Peng Dehuai arrived in Tbilisi, the capital of the Georgian Republic, on the 21st from Kiev.

The delegation was warmly welcomed by Mzhavanadze, Alternate Member of the Presidium of the CPSU Central Committee and First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Georgian Communist Party, Zhavakhishvili, Chairman of the Georgian Council of Ministers, Marshal Rokossovsky, Commander of the Transcaucasian Military District, Dumbadze, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Georgian Communist Party, and representatives of the working people of Tbilisi.

That afternoon, Mzhavanadze received Marshal Peng Dehuai and held talks with him.

Marshal Rokossovsky held a banquet to entertain the Chinese delegation. Rokossovsky warmly welcomed the Chinese guests on behalf of the commanders and fighters of the Transcaucasian Military District.

At the banquet, Mzhavanadze, on behalf of the Georgian Party and government and all the people, cordially welcomed the envoys of the great Chinese people.

Marshal Peng Dehuai delivered a speech in reply, first extending his greetings and best wishes to the Georgian Party and government and the Georgian people.

Peng Dehuai said that the Chinese army is an integral part of the state apparatus of the People's Republic of China. They vigilantly defend the peaceful labor of the Chinese people. Because the Soviet Union and China possess powerful armed forces, ready to give any aggressor a fatal blow when necessary, the schemes of the warmongers will also be shattered. The armed forces of China and the Soviet Union are the bastions of international peace and security.

Marshal Peng Dehuai pointed out that the glorious Communist Parties of our two countries are the source of the power and invincibility of the armies of China and the Soviet Union. The people of China and the Soviet Union, and the armed forces of China and the Soviet Union, have been and will continue to be closely united around the Communist Parties of their respective countries. There is no force in the world that can undermine this unity and the unbreakable friendship between our two countries. We have a common and correct compass – the immortal thought of Marxism-Leninism.

Next, Marshal Ye Jianying spoke, congratulating the heroic Soviet army that defends the security of its great motherland, congratulating the happy life of the Georgian people, and congratulating the homeland of the great Marxist-Leninist Stalin.

Zhavakhishvili also spoke at the banquet.

In the evening, the Chinese delegation visited the city of Tbilisi. Later, they were invited to attend a performance held at the District Officers' Club. The performances by the Georgian Folk Dance Troupe and the Song and Dance Ensemble of the Transcaucasian Military District left a deep impression on the distinguished guests. Residents of the Georgian capital everywhere received the representatives of the heroic Chinese people with great enthusiasm and friendliness.

    彭德怀元帅在第比利斯的招待会上致词
    中苏军队是国际和平堡垒
    新华社22日讯　据塔斯社报道：以彭德怀元帅为首的中国军事友好访苏代表团21日从基辅到达格鲁吉亚共和国首都第比利斯。
    代表团受到苏共中央主席团候补委员、格鲁吉亚共产党中央委员会第一书记姆日阿瓦纳泽，格鲁吉亚部长会议主席扎瓦希什维利，南高加索军区司令罗科索夫斯基元帅和格鲁吉亚共产党中央委员会书记杜姆巴德泽和第比利斯劳动人民代表的热烈欢迎。
    当天下午，姆日阿瓦纳泽接见了彭德怀元帅，并且和他谈了话。
    罗科索夫斯基元帅举行了宴会，招待中国代表团。罗科索夫斯基代表南高加索军区的指战员热烈地欢迎中国客人。
    姆日阿瓦纳泽在宴会上代表格鲁吉亚党和政府以及全体人民衷心地欢迎伟大中国人民的使者。
    彭德怀元帅致答词，他首先向格鲁吉亚党和政府以及格鲁吉亚人民致意并且表示最好的祝愿。
    彭德怀说，中国的军队是中华人民共和国国家机器的组成部分。他们警惕地捍卫着中国人民的和平劳动。由于苏联和中国拥有强大的武装力量，准备在必要时给予任何侵略者以致命的打击，所以战争贩子们的阴谋也将被粉碎。中苏两国的武装力量是国际和平与安全的堡垒。
    彭德怀元帅指出，我们两国光荣的共产党是中苏两国军队的威力和不可战胜的泉源。中苏两国人民、中苏两国的武装力量过去和将来都紧密地团结在本国共产党的周围。世界上没有一种力量能够破坏这种团结和我们两国牢不可破的友谊。我们有共同的正确的指南针——马克思列宁主义的不朽思想。
    接着，叶剑英元帅讲话，他祝贺捍卫自己伟大祖国安全的英勇的苏联军队，祝贺格鲁吉亚人民的幸福生活，祝贺伟大的马克思列宁主义者斯大林的祖国。
    扎瓦希什维利也在席间讲了话。
    晚上，中国代表团参观了第比利斯市容。后来他们被邀请出席区军官之家举行的表演会。格鲁吉亚民间舞蹈团和南高加索军区部队歌舞团的演出给贵宾们留下了深刻的印象。格鲁吉亚首都的居民到处都非常热情和友好地接待英勇的中国人民的代表。
