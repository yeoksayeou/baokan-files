Strive for a Bumper Wheat Harvest Next Year

This year's wheat planting season has seen the major wheat-producing areas in the Yellow River and Huai River basins suffer from droughts unseen in decades. Party organizations and governments at all levels mobilized the masses to launch a massive anti-drought wheat planting campaign. Now, the national winter wheat planting task has been basically completed, and Henan Province, which was severely affected by the drought, has even overfulfilled its wheat planting task. This is a great victory for the Chinese people in their march towards nature, a "miracle" that has never been seen in Chinese history. During the reactionary rule in 1938 and 1939, severe droughts in Shaanxi and Gansu made it impossible to plant winter wheat, leading to "peasants initially eating tree bark, then selling their children, and finally tearing apart corpses to eat the living." Wugong County, which was severely affected at the time, saw its population decrease from 180,000 to just over 90,000; two years after the disaster, 80% of the cultivated land was still barren. This year's drought-affected area is even wider, covering the Yellow River, Huai River basins, and various provinces in North China; the drought situation is also more severe. Taking Shaanxi as an example, the rainfall in the two months of August and September before wheat planting this year was only one-fourth of the normal year, even less than the same period in 1938 and 1939. It is estimated that about 100 million mu of wheat fields nationwide (out of a total of more than 360 million mu of winter wheat fields) were difficult to plant this autumn due to lack of water sources, lack of rain, and excessively dry soil. If agricultural cooperativization had not been realized, and if the whole Party had not mobilized to fully lead the masses in carrying out a nationwide anti-drought wheat planting campaign, the consequences of this year's drought would have been unimaginable.

The victory in fighting drought and planting wheat has laid the foundation for increasing summer grain production next year. However, it should be noted that completing the anti-drought wheat planting task is only the first hurdle in striving for a bumper harvest of summer grain next year. In order to achieve next year's summer grain production plan and create a good start for the grain production of the Second Five-Year Plan, we are still faced with many arduous combat tasks. In particular, it should be noted that due to the lateness of the season, some winter wheat in various places could not be planted; those that have been planted are of poor quality due to drought resistance and rush planting, and the phenomenon of missing seedlings and broken ridges is quite common. In Shandong Province, 30% of the wheat fields are missing seedlings, with severe cases reaching 50% to 80%; in Henan Province, the 60 million mu of wheat fields planted through drought resistance and rush planting generally have 20% missing seedlings, and some even have more than 50% missing seedlings; in the Jinnan area of Shanxi, about 20% of the wheat is also missing seedlings. At the same time, due to the all-out effort to fight drought and rush planting, many wheat fields were planted before basal fertilizer could be applied. The area of basal fertilizer applied to wheat fields in Henan Province is about 10% less than last year; in Shandong Province, about 20% of the wheat fields have not been applied with basal fertilizer and were planted directly into the ground.

In order to compensate for the possible impact of this year's autumn drought on next year's wheat yield, we must continue to maintain and carry forward the spirit of fighting drought and planting wheat, persist in protecting seedlings from drought, and strengthen wheat field management. The Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Shandong Provincial People's Committee have already made a "Decision on Striving for a Comprehensive Bumper Wheat Harvest Next Year and Creating 20 Million Mu of High-Yield Wheat Fields," requiring the launch of a "Five Waters and Three Fertilizers" movement on these 20 million mu of wheat fields, so that the harvest from these 20 million mu of high-yield fields is equivalent to the harvest from 40 million mu of ordinary wheat fields, in order to compensate for the losses caused by the reduction in wheat planting area and the poor quality of sowing. This decision is correct and timely. This is the most effective measure to strive for a bumper wheat harvest next year. All localities should, in accordance with local conditions, launch a large-scale wheat high-yield movement. This is not only to overcome the current difficulties and strive for a bumper wheat harvest next year; in this movement, we can also gradually fundamentally change production conditions and gain experience in large-scale high yields.

At present, there are 60 million mu of irrigated wheat fields in the north and 80 million mu of aquatic wheat fields in the south, with better production conditions and higher sowing quality. In these areas, we should mobilize the masses to strive to greatly increase wheat yields. Last year, Meng County in Henan Province implemented "Five Waters and Three Fertilizers" on 50,000 mu of wheat fields, increasing the yield per mu from 260 jin to 400 jin; Zhenze County in Jiangsu Province promoted the method of "Applying wax fertilizer and spring fertilizer universally, and draining water with wide ridges and deep ditches," increasing the average yield per mu of wheat in the county from 114 jin to 227 jin, doubling the yield. These two effective experiences in high yield should be earnestly promoted in areas with similar conditions in the north and south, respectively.

Wheat fields that were generally planted by fighting drought are planted late and are of poor quality. We should vigorously promote the application of manure water to make the seedlings grow strong; we should also use all water sources to implement winter irrigation and spring irrigation to protect seedlings from drought; in particular, we should apply more and earlier topdressing, and universally promote winter urine application to wheat to promote seedling growth.

Carrying out a large-scale wheat high-yield movement and striving for a bumper harvest next summer is of great significance to national economic construction and people's lives. This year, some areas had poor autumn grain harvests due to disasters, and in order to shorten the famine and connect food grain supplies early, we must ensure a bumper summer grain harvest next year. Increasing wheat production is also important for comprehensively increasing grain production. Huang County in Shandong, Chang'an and Gaoling in Shaanxi, Meng County in Henan, Zhengding and Haocheng in Hebei, which have already reached the 1967 grain production targets stipulated in the Forty Articles, all have wheat fields accounting for more than 50% of the grain cultivated land, and the yield per mu of wheat is mostly above 250 jin, more than double the national average yield. This is an important factor in the rapid increase in the annual grain output of these counties. For example, Huang County in Shandong Province increased grain production by more than 80 million jin in 1956 compared to 1952, of which more than 40 million jin was wheat. Since wheat fields in northern provinces account for a large proportion of cultivated land but the current yield is low, we must put more effort into increasing wheat yields in order to increase the annual grain output. In the south, many areas still have the situation of "Emphasizing major spring crops and neglecting wheat". This is also not conducive to completing the annual production increase task. Sichuan Province has seen rapid grain production increases in recent years, and one of the important reasons is that it has strengthened the leadership of annual production, paying attention to both major spring crops and winter crops such as wheat. In 1957, the average yield per mu of wheat in the province reached 169 jin, an increase of 48.25% compared to 1952, and the total wheat output increased by 98.1% compared to 1952. However, many provinces in the south still have low wheat yields. In recent years, the national wheat yield has been increasing year by year, but the unit area yield of wheat in some provinces in the south has always remained at the level of 60 to 70 jin. As long as these provinces attach importance to wheat production and take effective measures, they can quickly increase wheat yields, thereby achieving a comprehensive increase in grain production.

Water conservancy and fertilizers are the main guarantees for the bumper harvest of all crops, and wheat is naturally no exception. Carrying out the wheat high-yield movement must be closely combined with the activities of building water conservancy projects and accumulating fertilizer this winter and next spring. On the one hand, we must promote the construction of water conservancy projects and the accumulation of fertilizer through the wheat high-yield movement; on the other hand, we must expand the area of wheat field watering and topdressing as much as possible through the construction of water conservancy projects and the accumulation of fertilizer. Since we could use all water sources to fight drought and plant wheat some time ago, we can certainly use all water sources to expand wheat watering now; since we could dig up all water sources to fight drought and plant wheat some time ago, we can certainly dig up all fertilizer sources to strive for a bumper wheat harvest and prepare enough fertilizer for spring sowing next year.

At present, agricultural cooperatives in various places are discussing the "Forty Articles" Program and formulating agricultural development plans. In all wheat-producing areas, how to strive for high wheat yields should be listed as an important part of the discussion and planning. At the same time, management of rapeseed and other winter crops should also be strengthened, and winter plowing and winter pest control work should also be actively carried out in accordance with the predetermined plan. Areas with conditions for planting spring wheat should also prepare seeds for spring sowing. In short, we must start from all aspects and strive for a bumper wheat harvest next summer.

### 争取明年小麦大丰收

    争取明年小麦大丰收
    今年种麦季节，黄河流域、淮河流域主要产麦区遭到了几十年来少有的干旱。各级党组织和政府发动群众，开展了声势浩大的抗旱种麦运动。现在，全国冬小麦播种任务已经基本完成，受旱严重的河南省并且超额完成了种麦任务。这是我国人民向大自然进军的一次伟大胜利，是在我国历史上从来没有过的“奇迹”。在反动统治时代的1938年和1939年，陕甘大旱，种不上冬麦，以致“农民初则食树皮，继则卖儿鬻女，终则裂?死尸，易食生人”。当时受灾严重的武功县，人口从十八万减少到九万多；灾后两年，荒废的耕地仍达80％。今年旱区更广，遍及黄河、淮河流域及华北各省；旱情也更重。以陕西为例，今年种麦前8、9两月雨量，仅及常年的四分之一，较1938年和1939年同时期更少。今年秋季估计，全国因水源缺、不下雨、土太干而难以种上的麦田有一亿亩左右（全国冬小麦田共约三亿六千多万亩）。如果不是实现了农业合作化，如果不是全党动员、全力以赴地领导群众开展全民性的抗旱种麦运动，今年干旱的后果就会不堪设想。
    抗旱种麦的胜利，已经为明年夏粮增产打下了基础。但是，应当看到，完成抗旱种麦任务仅仅是突破了争取明年夏粮丰收的第一关。为了实现明年夏粮生产计划，为第二个五年计划的粮食生产创造一个良好的开端，在我们面前仍然摆着许多艰巨的战斗任务。特别应当看到：由于季节已晚，各地都有若干冬麦播种不上；已经种上的，由于抗旱抢种，质量较差，缺苗断垅的现象相当普遍。山东省有30％的麦田缺苗，其中缺苗率严重的达50％至80％；河南省抗旱抢种的六千多万亩麦田，一般缺苗20％，也有的缺苗在50％以上；山西晋南专区小麦缺苗也约达20％。同时，由于全力以赴地抗旱抢种，不少麦田来不及上基肥就种上了。河南省麦田施基肥面积约比去年减少10％；山东省约有20％的麦田未施基肥，白地下种。
    为了弥补今年秋旱对明年小麦产量可能发生的影响，必须继续保持和发扬抗旱种麦的劲头，坚持抗旱保苗，加强麦田管理。中共山东省委和山东省人民委员会已经作出了“关于力争明年小麦全面丰收，创造两千万亩小麦丰产田的决定”，要求在这两千万亩麦田上开展“五水三肥”运动，要使这两千万亩高额丰产田等于四千万亩一般麦田的收成，来弥补因为种麦面积减少和播种质量不高所造成的损失。这个决定是正确的，适时的。这是争取明年小麦丰收的一个最有效的措施。各地都应该根据当地情况，开展一个小麦大面积丰产运动。这不仅是为了克服当前困难，争取明年小麦丰收；在这个运动中，还可以逐步从根本上改变生产条件，取得大面积丰产的经验。
    目前，北方有六千万亩水浇麦田，南方有八千万亩水地小麦，生产条件较好，播种质量较高。在这些地区，应该发动群众，争取大大地提高小麦的产量。去年北方的河南省孟县有五万亩麦田实行了“五水三肥”，每亩产量由二百六十斤提高到四百斤；南方的江苏震泽县推广了“普施腊肥春肥，宽畦深沟排水”的办法，全县小麦平均亩产量由一百一十四斤提高到二百二十七斤，增产一倍。这两项行之有效的丰产经验，应该分别在北方和南方条件相同的地区认真推行。
    一般抗旱播种的麦田，播种较晚，质量较差。应该大力提倡拨粪水，使幼苗生长健壮；还要利用一切水源，实行冬灌、春灌，抗旱保苗；尤其要多施和早施追肥，普遍提倡冬季积尿浇麦，催苗发苗。
    开展小麦大面积丰产运动，力争明年夏季丰收，对国家经济建设和人民生活有重要意义。今年有些地区秋粮因灾歉收，为了缩短灾荒，早接口粮，必须保证明年夏粮丰收。增产小麦对全面提高粮食产量也有重要意义。去年已经达到四十条纲要规定的1967年粮食生产指标的山东黄县，陕西长安、高陵，河南孟县，河北正定、蒿城，麦田面积都占粮食耕地50％以上，小麦每亩产量大都在二百五十斤以上，高出全国平均产量一倍多。这是这些县份全年粮食产量迅速提高的一个重要因素。如山东黄县1956年比1952年增产粮食八千多万斤，其中有四千多万斤是小麦。由于北方各省麦田占耕地比重大而目前产量较低，要提高全年粮食产量，必须在提高小麦产量方面多下工夫。在南方，不少地区还有“重大春轻小麦”的情况。这对完成全年增产任务也是不利的。四川省几年来粮食增产速度很快，重要原因之一就是加强了全年生产的领导，既重视了大春，也重视了小麦等冬季作物。这个省1957年小麦平均亩产达到一百六十九斤，比1952年增加了48．25％，小麦的总产量比1952年增加了98．1％。但南方还有不少省小麦产量较低。几年来全国小麦产量逐年上升，但南方有些省小麦的单位面积产量始终停留在六、七十斤的水平。这些省只要重视小麦生产，并采取有效的措施，就能够迅速提高小麦的产量，从而也使粮食产量获得全面的提高。
    水利和肥料是一切农作物丰收的主要保证，对小麦来说自然也不例外。开展小麦丰产运动，必须同今冬明春兴修水利和积肥的活动密切结合起来。一方面通过小麦丰产运动来推动兴修水利和积肥，另一方面通过兴修水利和积肥，尽量扩大麦田浇水、追肥面积。前些时候既然可以利用一切水源抗旱种麦，现在也一定可以利用一切水源来扩大浇麦；前些时候既然可以挖掘一切水源来抗旱种麦，现在也一定可以挖掘一切肥源来争取小麦丰收和准备明年春播足够的肥料。
    目前，各地农业合作社正在讨论“四十条”纲要，制定农业发展规划。在一切产麦区，都应把如何争取小麦丰产，列为讨论和规划的一个重要内容。同时，对油菜和其他冬季作物，也要加强管理，冬耕和冬季治虫工作也要按照预定计划积极进行。有种植春小麦条件的地区，还要准备好春播的种子。总之，要从多方面一齐动手，争取明年夏季小麦大丰收。
