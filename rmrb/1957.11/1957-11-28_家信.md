    A Family Letter	Du Xiaofu
    It had been almost a year since I received a letter from my older brother. As soon as I received it, I immediately thought of the disagreements my brother, sister-in-law, and I had had. I thought to myself, "It must be nagging me again about finding a job for the child. What else would he write to me about!"
    Last summer, my nephew, Xiaonong, didn't pass the high school entrance exam, so he started working in the agricultural cooperative. At that time, our village had just established an advanced cooperative, so I wrote a letter encouraging Xiaonong to settle down and participate in agricultural production, striving to become a new type of farmer. Xiaonong replied to me, saying he was willing to listen to me and would continue to work and learn in the cooperative. But my brother wrote to me again and again, asking me to find a job for the child in the city. I wrote back to my brother, explaining the reasons many times, but he still kept writing, as if sending more letters would somehow make me find a job for the child in the city.
    This Spring Festival, I took leave from my work unit to go home. Partly because I had been working away from home for several years and wanted to visit, and partly because I wanted to take the opportunity to see how my nephew was doing in the cooperative and also to persuade my brother face-to-face to give up the idea of finding a job for the child in the city. The afternoon before the Spring Festival, I returned to my hometown. Just as I approached the village, my nephew happened to run out from a group of laughing people, warmly took the bag from my hand, and accompanied me towards home. I walked behind Xiaonong, examining his figure. He had grown almost a head taller than when I had seen him two years ago. Calculating his age, he was already seventeen. I thought to myself, "What a sturdy young man, and educated too! It's so good for him to participate in agricultural production!"
    As soon as I entered the front door of my house, Xiaonong pointed to the newly built two-room tile-roofed house and introduced, "Uncle! We had a bumper harvest here this summer. This house was newly built by our family after the summer harvest and is now temporarily used as our cooperative's office." I was eager to know if my nephew was truly settled into production, so I went with him into the cooperative office and tentatively asked him, "Are you used to working in the cooperative?" "I'm used to it now. I'm very happy to work in the cooperative. Now, besides production, I also work as a work-point recorder. The Youth League branch also admitted me to the League two months ago." I asked, "Then why does your father still write to me asking me to find you a job in the city?" "My father and I don't think the same way. He always says, 'A middle school graduate, what future is there in following the back end of an ox?' He started to make me feel uneasy about it. The cooperative director and the Youth League secretary even criticized him for it. I didn't know he was writing to you."
    On the night before I left home, I finally had the chance to talk about family matters with my brother and sister-in-law. Before I could bring up Xiaonong's matter, my brother brought it up first, "Xiaofu! This time you're going to Beijing, you must find a way to get Xiaonong a job in the city. He's been to school for eight or nine years; it's not right for him to stay at home."
      "Now, government offices or factories in the city don't need a lot of people, it's not easy to find a job in the city. In the future, as agricultural cooperatives develop, they will need a large number of educated young people. It's very good for Xiaonong to work in the cooperative. Why do you still want to find a job in the city!..." Before I could finish speaking, my sister-in-law interrupted:
      "I heard that workers in factories are introduced through the labor bureau. Can't you, working in the Ministry of Labor, find a job for your own child?"
      "Our current government is different from the old society. It doesn't do things based on personal connections. If government offices or factories in the city need people, the government will introduce them as long as they meet the requirements. The city offices and factories simply don't want people from the countryside." I replied to my sister-in-law with a smile.
      "You only say nice things. I don't think you care about your own nephew. If Xiaonong were your child, you would have introduced him to a job long ago." The smiling expression on my sister-in-law's face couldn't hide her feelings of blame towards me. I couldn't help but feel wronged, but I couldn't find more appropriate words to persuade her. I thought to myself: If Xiaonong were really my own child, I'd show you what I could do! At this time, my brother added fuel to the fire, saying, "The family supported you through university in the past. Now that you have a job, you don't have any family concept at all." Surrounded by these two attacks, I had to persuade them to stop the conversation.
    After arriving at my work unit, I sent many letters to my brother, but I didn't receive any replies. I knew my brother and sister-in-law were resenting me.
    As soon as I received this letter, I felt as if a task had not been completed. I thought to myself: "I can't accommodate my brother and sister-in-law's backward thinking. I must write back to severely criticize them and not just gently persuade them as I have in the past." So I prepared to write back immediately and opened my brother's letter. The letter said:
    "Dear Xiaofu: It's been almost a year since I wrote to you. It's all our fault, your sister-in-law and I, for resenting you not finding a job for the child. We gave you a hard time when you came home for the Spring Festival. Please don't hold it against us. You were right. It's all the same what job you do now. Since you left, our hometown has changed a lot. Now our county and township leaders are all participating in production with the farmers in the cooperative. Several high school graduates have also come to our cooperative. In the future, I will definitely let our child, Xiaonong, work in the cooperative for the rest of his life. This Spring Festival, if you have the opportunity, it would be best if you could take leave and come home to see."
    After reading the letter, I felt as if I were walking through the fields of the vastly changed countryside, and the stubborn yet simple images of my brother and sister-in-law appeared before my eyes.

    家信	杜效甫
    将近一年没有接到哥哥的来信，刚一接到这封信，立刻又想到哥哥及嫂嫂和我闹意见的事情来，心里在想：“一定又是啰嗦着给孩子找工作的事情了，再还会有什么事情给我来信呢！”
    去年暑假，我的侄儿小农没有考上高中，就在农业合作社里参加生产了。那时我们村子里刚成立了高级社，我就写信鼓励小农安心参加农业生产，争取作一个新式农民。小农给我回信表示愿意听我的话，就在社里生产和学习下去。可是我的哥哥却接二连三地给我来信，要我设法给孩子在城市里找工作，我给哥哥回信讲了多少道理，他仍照样不住地来信，好像多来几回信，我就总会给孩子在城市里找到工作似的。
    今年春节，我从机关上请假回家，一方面因为我出来工作几年没有回家，回家看看；另一方面，想借回家的机会，看看侄儿在社里生产和学习的情况，同时想当面劝劝我的哥哥让他丢掉给孩子在城市里找工作的这桩心事。春节的先一天下午，我回到家乡，刚一走到村子跟前，恰好我的侄儿从一群欢笑的人群里跑了出来，亲热地接住我手中的提包，陪我一同向家中走去。我走在小农的身后，端详着他的身材，比我两年以前见他的时候，又几乎长高了一头，计算他的年龄已经是十七周岁了，我心里在说：“多么胖实的小伙子，又有文化，参加农业生产多好呀！”
    刚一走进我家的前门，小农就指着新盖的两间瓦房向我介绍：“叔叔！夏天咱们这里普遍丰收了，这房是咱家在夏收后新盖的，现在暂时做了咱们社里的办公室。”我急于想知道侄儿是不是真正安心生产，就顺便同他先一起走进合作社的办公室内，试探着问他：“你在社里生产习惯么？”“现在已经习惯了，我很高兴在社里生产，现在我除了生产，还作了记工员。前两个月团支部还吸收我入团了。”我问：“那为什么你爸爸还给我写信要给你在城市里找工作呢？”“我爸爸和我的想法就不一样，他老是嘴上吊着‘中学毕业的人了，打牛后半截没有出息’，开始把我的心里也叫他说得七上八下的，为这事情社主任和团支部书记还批评过他呢；他给你写信我不知道。”
    在离开家的前一晚上，才有机会跟哥哥和嫂嫂谈起家务事了。当我还没提起小农的事来，谈着谈着，哥哥就先提起来了：“效甫！这一次去北京了，一定得想法给小农在城里找个工作，上了八、九年的学，待在家里太不像样子。”
      “现在城市里机关或工厂都不需要很多人，城市里的工作不好找；今后农业合作社发展了，正需要大批有文化的青年，小农在社里生产就很好，何必还要在城市里找工作呢！……”我还没说完，嫂嫂就插上嘴了：
      “听说去工厂里当工人都是劳动机关介绍进去的，难道你在劳动部里工作，还不能给咱自己的孩子找个工作么？”
      “咱们现在的政府和旧社会不一样了，不是按人情面子办事，若果城市机关或工厂需要人的话，只要够条件的政府都会给介绍的。现在城市机关、工厂就是不向农村要人。”我笑着答复嫂嫂。
      “你光是说的很好听，我看你就是不关心自己的侄儿，小农要是你的孩子，恐怕你早就给介绍工作了。”嫂嫂讲话时微笑的样子，怎么也压不住她对我责备的心情。我的心里也不禁感到委屈，但我再找不到更适当的话来说服她，心里在想：如果小农真正是我自己的孩子，我就给你做个样子看看！这时候，哥哥又火上加油地说：“过去家庭供你大学毕了业，现在你有了工作，就没有一点家庭观念了。”我在两面夹攻之中，只好劝了劝他们，停止了谈话。
    来到机关以后，我给哥哥去了多少次信，都没有接到回信，我知道哥哥和嫂嫂是在埋怨着我了。
    这回一接到信，我就觉得好像一件任务没有完成一样，心里在说：“不能对哥哥和嫂嫂的落后思想迁就，一定得写回信重重地批评他们，不能再像过去那样不疼不痒地只劝说劝说。”于是准备立即写回信，就把哥哥的来信拆开，信上写着：
    “效甫弟：快一年没有给你去信了，这都怪我和你嫂嫂怨你不给孩子找工作。春节你回家时，受了我和你嫂嫂的气，你千万不要把这些记在心里。还是你说得对，现在无论做什么工作都是一样的。自你走后，咱们家乡又变了大样子，现在咱们这里的县长、乡长都到社里和农民一起参加生产，咱们社里还来了几个高中毕业学生，今后我一定要让咱的孩子小农在社里生产一辈子。今年春节，你如果有机会的话，顶好能请假回家看看。”
    看完信后，我好像亲自走在经过巨大变化的农村的田野上，眼前浮现着哥哥和嫂嫂那种固执而又质朴的形象。
