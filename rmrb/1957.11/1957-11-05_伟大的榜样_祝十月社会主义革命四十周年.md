Great Example
——Celebrating the 40th Anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution
Li Fuchun

The forty-year history of the Soviet Union since its founding has proven the great vitality of Marxism-Leninism and the socialist system with glorious facts. Socialism has transformed a backward agricultural Russia into an advanced industrialized power in a relatively short period.

Under the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government, the great Soviet people, based on Lenin's principles for socialist construction—achieving the modernization of industry, the collectivization of agriculture, and carrying out a cultural revolution, etc.—thoroughly solved the task of building socialism in forty years and are now solving the task of building communism. From 1917 to the present, the Soviet Union's industry has developed extremely strongly. In 1957, the total industrial output increased thirty-two times compared to 1913, with the means of production industry increasing seventy-three times, and the machinery manufacturing and metal processing industries increasing nearly two hundred times. During this period, Soviet agriculture has greatly developed on the basis of collectivization and mechanization. In 1957, the sown area of various crops increased by more than 50% compared to 1913, and the total output of grain and technical crops has greatly increased. The Soviet Union has been at the forefront of the world in scientific and technological research, in the quantity and quality of engineering and technical personnel, and in the technical equipment of major sectors of the national economy. The recent successful launch of artificial satellites by the Soviet Union proves that the Soviet Union has climbed to unprecedented heights in science and technology. Moreover, everyone can understand that, if we do not count the years of war and economic recovery, the Soviet Union has used only twenty years to develop its national economy, science, technology, and culture to such a high level. Such a rate of development is undoubtedly unprecedented in the history of all countries.

The brilliant achievements of socialist construction in the Soviet Union have not only greatly improved the material and cultural living standards of the people at home but also set the best example for the construction work of all socialist countries, strengthened the confidence in struggle of all countries and people who are still in a state of oppression, and provided a strong guarantee for the sacred cause of world peace. The Soviet Union has proven to all mankind that the socialist-communist system is bound to win, and Marxism-Leninism is bound to win.

The Soviet Union's experience in building socialism is the most comprehensive, richest, and most advanced experience in the world today. Having the Soviet Union's experience to follow is an extremely favorable condition for our country to build socialism. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people have always unswervingly advanced along the glorious road opened up by the October Revolution. In the various stages of the Chinese revolution, in the period after liberation of restoring the national economy and implementing the first five-year plan, learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union has always been an important task for us. In future construction, earnestly learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union will still be an important task for us. With the development of the socialist cause, we should learn from the Soviet Union even better.

Our Chinese people's current main task is to transform an economically and culturally backward China into a socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and a high level of science, technology, and culture. We are now facing roughly the same tasks as the Soviet Union in the early days of its founding. The Soviet Union's experience is of great use to us. Earnestly learning from the Soviet Union's experience makes it possible for us to achieve greater successes in a shorter period. In the process of learning, we must adopt a Marxist-Leninist attitude, that is, combine the Soviet Union's experience with China's specific conditions. We have done this in the past, and we should continue to do so in the future.

The Soviet Union's experience proves that to build socialism, it is necessary to comprehensively and thoroughly defeat capitalism economically, politically, and ideologically, and solve the problem of whether to take the socialist road or the capitalist road. The socialist revolution in our country's economy has now been basically completed through the high tide of transforming the private ownership of the means of production in 1956; the socialist revolution in politics and ideology has also achieved significant victories through the past movements, mainly the struggle to counterattack the bourgeois rightists this year. However, the socialist revolution, whether in the economy or in politics and ideology, has not yet come to an end. Especially in politics and ideology, it will still require a considerable period of effort to finally consolidate socialism. Moreover, the complete victory and consolidation of the socialist system must be based on a strong material foundation, first of all, the foundation of modern industry and modern agriculture.

In order to establish a strong socialist material base, we must actively promote economic construction. In construction work, we should determine our construction policy based on the situation in our country: a large population, the rural population accounts for the vast majority, the amount of cultivated land and arable land is relatively small, the original economy is backward, the people's living standards are still relatively low, and the country has a large area and abundant resources, etc. First of all, we should start from the 600 million people, and make overall plans and appropriate arrangements for production, construction, labor, and people's livelihood. We should continue to give priority to the development of heavy industry, because without developed heavy industry, it is impossible to achieve the modernization of industry, and it is also impossible to achieve the modernization of agriculture. Under the current conditions in China, we must vigorously develop agriculture while continuing to give priority to the development of heavy industry, so that industry and agriculture can be developed simultaneously and closely combined to achieve mutual promotion. In all construction undertakings, we should comprehensively and persistently practice increasing production and practicing economy, implement the policy of building the country through diligence and thrift, and carry out socialist construction in a more, faster, better, and more economical way. We should also strive to cultivate intellectuals who are loyal to the socialist cause and organize a strong contingent of science, technology, culture, and art of the working class. In these areas, the practice of socialist construction in the Soviet Union has provided us with many valuable experiences.

Under the guidance of the great internationalist thought, the Soviet people have given the greatest support and assistance to our country's revolutionary cause and construction cause. In addition to experience guidance and spiritual encouragement, during the first five-year plan period alone, the Soviet Union helped our country design 205 major industrial backbone projects (131 of which have already started construction), supplied a large amount of metal materials and complete sets of modern machinery and equipment, and dispatched a large number of outstanding experts to our country to help our construction work. The rapid and great achievements of our country's first five-year plan are inseparable from the assistance of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, especially from the comprehensive and systematic assistance of the Soviet Union. We sincerely thank the Soviet Union for its fraternal assistance to our country. In future construction, while implementing the policy of self-reliance, we must further strengthen the mutual assistance, cooperation, and close integration of fraternal countries in the socialist camp led by the Soviet Union in all aspects of economy, technology, science, and culture.

May the victory of the October Socialist Revolution forever illuminate all mankind.

    伟大的榜样
    ——祝十月社会主义革命四十周年
    李富春
    苏联建国以来四十年的历史，用光辉的事实证明了马克思列宁主义和社会主义制度具有伟大的生命力。社会主义把一个落后的农业的俄国在较短的时期内变为一个先进的工业化强国。
    伟大的苏联人民在苏联共产党和苏联政府的领导下，依据列宁确定的关于社会主义建设的原理——实现工业的现代化，实现农业的集体化，进行文化革命等等，在四十年的时间内彻底解决了建设社会主义的任务，现在正在解决建设共产主义的任务。从1917年到现在，苏联的工业有了极强大的发展，1957年比1913年，工业总产量增长了三十二倍，其中生产资料工业增长了七十三倍，机器制造和金属加工工业增长了将近二百倍。在这期间，苏联的农业在集体化和机械化的基础上得到了很大的发展，1957年比1913年，各种农作物的播种面扩大了50％以上，粮食和技术作物的总产量都很大地提高了。苏联在科学技术的研究方面，在工程技术人员的数量和质量方面，在国民经济主要部门的技术装备方面，都已经居于世界各国的前列。最近苏联成功地发射人造卫星，证明苏联在科学技术上已经攀登到前所未有的高峰。而且大家都可以懂得，如果不计算战争和恢复国民经济的年份，苏联把国民经济和科学技术文化发展到如此高度，不过用了二十多年的时间。这样的发展速度，在世界各国的历史上无疑是空前的。
    苏联社会主义建设的辉煌成就，不仅大大地提高了国内人民的物质生活和文化生活的水平，而且给一切社会主义国家的建设工作树立了最好的榜样，使一切现在还处于被压迫地位的国家和人民增强了斗争的信心，为神圣的世界和平事业提供了有力的保障。苏联向全人类证明了：社会主义——共产主义制度必然要胜利，马克思列宁主义必然要胜利。
    苏联建设社会主义的经验，是现今世界上最全面最丰富和最先进的经验。有苏联的经验可循，是我国建设社会主义的一个极有利的条件。中国人民在中国共产党的领导下，始终不渝地沿着十月革命开辟的光辉道路前进。在中国革命的各个阶段中，在解放以后恢复国民经济和执行第一个五年计划的时期内，学习苏联的先进经验一向是我们的一项重要任务。在今后的建设中，认真学习苏联的先进经验仍然是我们的一项重要任务。随着社会主义事业的发展，我们应该更好地向苏联学习。
    我们中国人民当前的主要任务，是要把一个经济文化落后的中国改变为具有现代化工业和现代化农业及高度科学技术文化的社会主义国家。我们现在面临着和苏联建国初期大体相同的任务。苏联的经验对我们有极大的用处。认真地学习苏联的经验，就使我们有可能用较短的时间取得较大的成就。在学习的过程中，我们必须采取马克思列宁主义的态度，即把苏联的经验同中国的具体情况相结合。过去我们这样做了，今后应该继续这样做。
    苏联的经验证明，要建成社会主义，必须全面地和彻底地从经济上、政治上、思想上战胜资本主义，解决走社会主义道路还是走资本主义道路的问题。我国经济上的社会主义革命，经过1956年的改造生产资料私有制的高潮，现在已经基本上完成了；政治上和思想上的社会主义革命，经过过去的历次运动，主要是今年的反击资产阶级右派的斗争，也已经取得了重大的胜利。但是，无论经济上或者政治上、思想上的社会主义革命，还没有全部结束，特别在政治上思想上还必须经过一个相当长时期的努力，才能最后地巩固社会主义。而且，社会主义制度的全部胜利和巩固，又必须建立起强大的物质基础，首先是建立现代化工业和现代化农业的基础。
    为了建立强大的社会主义的物质基础，我们必须积极地推进经济建设事业。在建设工作中，应该根据我国人口多，农村人口占绝大比重，已耕地和可耕地比较少，原来经济又落后，人民生活水平还比较低，以及国家幅员大，资源丰富等等情况，来确定我们建设的方针。首先应当从六亿人口出发，对生产、建设、劳动和民生进行统筹兼顾，适当安排。我们应该继续使重工业得到优先的发展，因为没有发达的重工业，就不能实现工业的现代化，也就不能实现农业的现代化。而在中国的目前条件下，我们必须在继续优先发展重工业的基础上，大力发展农业，使工业和农业同时并举，密切结合，以收互相促进之效。在一切建设事业中，我们应该全面地持久地厉行增产节约，贯彻执行勤俭建国的方针，又多、又快、又好、又省地进行社会主义的建设。我们还应该努力培养忠实于社会主义事业的知识分子，组织起工人阶级自己的科学、技术、文化、艺术的强大队伍。这些方面，苏联社会主义建设的实践，已经给我们提供了许多宝贵的经验。
    苏联人民在伟大的国际主义思想的指导下，对我国的革命事业和建设事业给予了最大的支援和帮助。除了经验的指导和精神上的鼓舞以外，仅仅在第一个五年计划期间，苏联帮助我国设计了二百零五项重大的工业骨干工程（其中已经开始施工的有一百三十一项），供应了大量的金属材料和成套的近代机器设备，并且派遣了大批优秀的专家来我国帮助我们的建设工作。我国的第一个五年计划所以能够取得迅速而巨大的成就，是同苏联和各人民民主国家的援助分不开的，特别是同苏联这种全面的和系统的援助分不开的。我们衷心地感谢苏联对我国兄弟般的援助。在今后的建设中，我们在执行自力更生方针的同时，必须进一步加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各兄弟国家在经济、技术、科学、文化各个方面的互助合作和亲密结合。
    祝十月社会主义革命的胜利光辉永远照耀全人类。
