In the Fight Against the Rightists

    Yang Jiangzhu and Others Organize Anti-Party Alliance
    Frantically Attack the Party's Principles of Running a Newspaper

    (Reported by this newspaper) The seven-member anti-Party, anti-socialist alliance headed by Yang Jiangzhu (editor, pen name Yang Yang, Tao Guang) and Wan Hanlin (reporter, probationary party member, pen name Wan Lin) has been crushed in the anti-Rightist struggle at the Yangtze Daily.

    Anti-Party elements such as Yang Jiangzhu ganged up during the "blooming and contending" period, using "improving the newspaper" as a guise, and first attacked the Party's principles of running a newspaper. Wan Hanlin slandered Party newspapers as being "run by those in power," unable to "speak fairly," and said that they were "constrained" by the nature of Party newspapers, thus "unable to choose what the masses love to read." They opposed the newspaper's promotion of the great achievements of socialist construction, saying that it was "purely business-related," "insiders don't read it, and outsiders don't understand it." They advocated that newspapers should publish more unsolved cases, murders, thefts, actors' private lives... and even euphemistically called it "interfering in life." They also openly threatened the editor-in-chief to agree to their proposals.

　　In order to achieve the above objectives, they frantically attacked the Party's leadership over the newspaper. They described the Party's leadership as "interference," a "man-made obstacle" to running the newspaper well, and "the relations of production restricting the productive forces." They attacked the instructions of the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the CPC as "rigid frameworks" that "restrained" the "individuality" of cadres, stifled their "independent thinking," and turned everyone into "ideological lazybones." They also repeatedly planned to revise the list of the editorial board, attempting to fundamentally eliminate the Party's organizational leadership over the newspaper through "elections."

### 杨江柱等组织反党联盟  疯狂攻击党的办报原则

    杨江柱等组织反党联盟
    疯狂攻击党的办报原则
    本报讯　以杨江柱（编辑，笔名杨扬、陶光）、万寒林（记者，预备党员，笔名万林）为首的七人反党反社会主义联盟已在长江日报的反右派斗争中被击溃。
    杨江柱等反党分子在鸣放中结成一气，以“改进报纸”为招牌，首先攻击党的办报原则。万寒林污蔑党报是“在朝的人办的”，不能“说公道话”，说受了党报这个性质的“约束”，就“不能选择群众所爱看的东西”。他们反对报纸宣传社会主义建设的伟大成就，说这是“纯业务性的”、“内行不看外行看不懂”的东西。他们主张报纸要多登无头案、凶杀案、盗窃案、演员私生活……还美其名曰这才叫“干预生活”。他们并公然要挟总编辑同意他们的主张。
　　为了达到上述目的，他们即疯狂地攻击党对报纸的领导。他们把党的领导说成是“干涉”，是办好报纸“人为的障碍”，是“生产关系束缚了生产力”。他们攻击中共武汉市委的指示是“框框”，“束缚了”干部的“个性”，扼杀了干部的“独立思考”，使大家变成了“思想懒汉”，他们还多次酝酿改选编委会的名单，企图通过“选举”，从根本上取消党在组织上对报社的领导。　（沈淑均）
