Discovered at the "Yellow Emperor City" Ruins...

    In the area north of Sanbao Village, about fifty li southeast of Zhuolu County, there is a site traditionally known as the ruins of the "Yellow Emperor City". In mid-October this year, cultural departments of Hebei Province and Zhuolu County sent people here to conduct an investigation and discovered many cultural relics. Among them, those belonging to production tools include stone knives, stone axes, stone adzes, stone pestles, grinding tools, as well as shell tools, pottery spinning wheels, etc.; those belonging to daily life utensils include broken pottery dou (stemmed dish), pottery li (tripod cauldron), pottery ding (cooking pot), pottery gang (large jar), pottery basin, pottery zeng (steamer), etc. In addition to the original remains of the city wall foundations, rammed earth walls were discovered in the collapsed area in the central part of the city site. Some rammed earth layers are about eighteen centimeters thick, and some are about twenty-five centimeters thick. Various pan tiles, barrel tiles, and semi-eaves tiles with patterns such as deer shapes were also discovered in the northern part of the city site.
    In the past, the cultural department of Zhuolu County and local people had discovered stone axes, stone percussion tools with large holes, turtle-shaped knob, frog-shaped knob copper seals, and various ancient coins within this city site.
    Based on the cultural relics discovered in the past and this time, it is inferred that this city may be a site from around the Warring States period, and according to historical records, it is very likely to be the ancient city of Zhuolu.

    在“黄帝城”遗址里发现的……
    在涿鹿县城东南约五十多里的三堡村北的地方，一向传说是“黄帝城”的遗址。今年10月中旬，河北省和涿鹿县文化部门派人在这里进行调查，发现了许多文物。其中属于生产工具方面的有石刀、石斧、石?、石杵、磨用器及蚌器、陶纺轮等；属于生活用具的有残陶豆、陶鬲、陶鼎、陶缸、陶盆、陶甑等。建设遗迹除原有的残城墙基址外，又在城址内中部塌陷的地方发现板筑墙，板筑层有的厚约十八公分，有的厚约二十五公分。在城址内北部还发现了各种板瓦、桶瓦和带鹿形等花纹的半瓦当。
    涿鹿县文化部门和当地群众过去就曾在这城址内发现过石斧、带巨孔的石敲砸器、龟钮、蛙钮铜印以及各种古代钱币等。
    根据以往和这次发现的文物推断，这个城可能是战国前后的遗址，而且根据史书记载，很可能就是古代的涿鹿城。
