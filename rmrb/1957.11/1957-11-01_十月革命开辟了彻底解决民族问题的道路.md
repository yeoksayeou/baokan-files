The October Revolution Opened the Path to Thoroughly Solving the Nationalities Problem
Liu Geping

(III)

The experiences of the Soviet Union and China fully prove that the solution of the nationalities problem and the realization of friendly cooperation among all nationalities are impossible without the strong leadership of the Communist Party. The Communist Party is the core force uniting and leading the people of all nationalities in the struggle for liberation and the construction of socialism. Without the leadership of the Communist Party, there would be no liberation of all nationalities, no socialism, and no close cooperation among all nationalities, and therefore no happiness, development, and prosperity for the people of all nationalities.

The Communist Party is the vanguard of the proletariat armed with Marxism-Leninism. The proletariat does not exploit anyone, and fights for a social system in which no one exploits anyone. The class status of the proletariat determines that it opposes any national oppression and national privileges and advocates the liberation of oppressed nations and the complete equality of all nationalities. Marx and Engels said that a people who oppress other peoples cannot be free. Based on this worldview of the proletariat, the Communist method of solving the nationalities problem is opposed to the bourgeois method. The bourgeois method is a method of mutual destruction among nationalities, a method of dispersing nationalities, and a method of strengthening national hatred among the working people of all nationalities. Directly opposed to the bourgeoisie, the Communist method is to unswervingly realize the unity, friendship, and cooperation of the proletariat and all working people of all nationalities.

Within a country, the complete centralization and unity of all class organizations of the proletariat of all nationalities, first and foremost the party organizations, is the key to realizing the common victorious revolutionary struggle of the proletariat and all working people of all nationalities within the country. Lenin said: "The interests of the working class require the workers of all nationalities within a given country to merge into a single proletarian organization—political, trade union, cooperative, and educational. Only this merger of workers of all nationalities into a single organization enables the proletariat to wage a victorious struggle against international capital and reactionaries, as well as against the propaganda and attempts of landlords, priests, and bourgeois democrats of all nationalities." (Published by the Research Department of the Nationalities Institute, "Lenin on the National Question," p. 64) He also said:

"The history of the abominable autocracy has left us with extreme separation between the working classes of the various nationalities oppressed by this autocracy. This separation is the worst phenomenon and the greatest obstacle in the struggle against autocracy. We must not legalize this abominable phenomenon, we must not sanctify this bad phenomenon with any party separatism or the 'principle' of party 'federalism'."
(Ibid., p. 25) When building the Russian Bolshevik Party, Lenin, based on this principle, carried out unremitting struggle against various nationalist elements, built a unified Communist Party of the proletariat of all nationalities in the Soviet Union, and ensured the solution of the nationalities problem in the Soviet Union and the construction and consolidation of a socialist multinational state.

The Chinese Communist Party was built according to Lenin's doctrine on party building and the example of the Soviet Communist Party. It is the unified political party of the working class of all nationalities in our country. Communists from all nationalities have joined the ranks of the Chinese Communist Party and are fighting for the construction of socialism and communism in our country. The Chinese Communist Party represents the interests and the direction of advancement of all nationalities in our country, and leads our country's nationalities from victory to victory, and has therefore won a high prestige among all nationalities.

Unremittingly opposing nationalist tendencies within the party, and educating the people against all forms of nationalism with the spirit of national equality and national friendship, is an important condition for the Communist Party to be able to solve the nationalities problem victoriously. Bourgeois nationalism is contrary to socialism and the proletarian view of the nation. Lenin taught us that "bourgeois nationalism and proletarian internationalism—these are two irreconcilable and mutually hostile slogans that correspond to the two major class camps of the entire capitalist world and represent two policies (even: two worldviews) on the national question." (See Critical Remarks on the National Question) If we do not struggle against bourgeois nationalism, national unity cannot be consolidated, and the cause of socialism will also be harmed.

The unbreakable friendship between the nationalities of the Soviet Union was developed and consolidated in the process of opposing and overcoming bourgeois nationalism. The experience of the Soviet Union proves that a multinational socialist state can only be truly consolidated and the cooperation between its nationalities can only be truly harmonious when bourgeois nationalism is resolutely and thoroughly overcome.

In our country, both Han chauvinism among the Han nationality and local nationalism among the minority nationalities are dangerous tendencies that hinder national unity. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: The relationship between the Han nationality and the minority nationalities must be handled well. The key to this problem is to overcome Han chauvinism. In minority nationalities where local nationalism exists, local nationalism should also be overcome at the same time. ("On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People") The Chinese Communist Party has taken many major measures to oppose and overcome these two kinds of nationalism. In 1952 and 1956, it conducted inspections of the implementation of national policies throughout the country, focusing on criticizing Han chauvinism and also criticizing local nationalism, and achieved certain results.

Of course, nationalism cannot be completely overcome with just a few criticisms. Han chauvinism still exists. Its main manifestations are: despising or even discriminating against minority nationalities, not caring about the needs of minority nationalities; ignoring national characteristics and autonomous rights, and copying the working methods and experiences of the Han areas; and in cooperation and working with minority nationality cadres, acting arbitrarily or even forcing one's own ideas on others. Local nationalism also exists in minority nationalities, and since the high tide of socialist transformation, there has been new growth in many minority nationalities. Its main manifestations are: in national relations, conservatism and exclusiveness, failing to see the importance of unity and mutual assistance among nationalities, opposing help from outside nationalities, especially the Han nationality; on the issue of national unity, in some places there are serious separatist tendencies attempting to undermine the unification of the motherland; on the issue of party building, violating the principles of communist unity and unification, adopting discriminatory attitudes towards party members of other nationalities, especially opposing party members of other nationalities from holding leading positions in local organizations. The growth of local nationalism reflects the struggle and resistance of the bourgeoisie and other exploiting classes in the minority nationalities in the face of the continuous victory of socialism.

Now, the Chinese Communist Party is leading the people of all nationalities in our country in a rectification movement, including the opposition to bourgeois rightists. This is a socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts, a major step that must be taken to consolidate the socialist system after the basic realization of the socialist transformation of the ownership of the means of production. Striving for the complete victory of socialism and consolidating the socialist system are the great historical tasks currently facing the people of all nationalities in our country. In order to realize this great task, in terms of the nationalities problem, it is necessary to carry out many arduous economic, cultural, and political and ideological work. It is particularly important to strengthen political and ideological work at present. The political and ideological work mentioned here mainly involves carrying out a resolute struggle against bourgeois nationalism. In the past, we emphasized opposing Han chauvinism, which was necessary. In the future, in places where this tendency exists, we must still resolutely oppose it. Since local nationalism has grown in many minority nationalities, it is entirely necessary to emphasize opposing local nationalism in these nationalities.

Opposing bourgeois nationalism is one of the contents of the political and ideological socialist revolution currently being carried out in our country, and is an important part of the struggle between the socialist and capitalist roads. Overcome the negative factors of bourgeois nationalism, further unite the nationalities of our country, and strive under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party to build a socialist industrialized motherland family where all nationalities prosper together. We have the unbreakable unity of the two great powers of China and the Soviet Union, the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, the sincere assistance of the Soviet Union in all aspects, and the support of all peace-loving and progressive forces in the world. Our great socialist construction cause will surely be victorious. (To be continued)

    十月革命开辟了彻底解决民族问题的道路
    刘格平
              （三）
    苏联的经验和我国的经验都充分证明：民族问题的解决、各民族友好合作的实现，离开共产党的坚强领导，是不可能的。共产党是团结和领导各民族人民争取解放和建设社会主义的核心力量。没有共产党的领导，便没有各民族的解放，便没有社会主义，便没有各民族的亲密合作，因此也就没有各民族人民的幸福、发展和繁荣。
    共产党是以马克思列宁主义武装起来的无产阶级的先锋队伍。无产阶级不剥削任何人，而且为追求一个人不剥削人的社会制度而斗争。无产阶级的阶级地位，决定了它反对任何民族压迫和民族特权而主张被压迫民族的解放和各民族的彻底平等。马克思恩格斯说，压迫他族人民的人民是不能够自由的。根据无产阶级的这种世界观，共产党人解决民族问题的方法，是与资产阶级的方法相对立的。资产阶级的方法是使各民族彼此摧残的方法，使各民族彼此离散的方法，是加强各民族劳动人民之间民族仇视的方法。与资产阶级正相反，共产党人的方法是坚持不渝地实现各民族无产阶级和一切劳动人民的团结、友好和合作。
    一个国家内，各民族无产阶级的一切阶级组织首先是党的组织的完全集中和统一，是实现国内各民族无产阶级和一切劳动人民共同进行胜利的革命斗争的关键。列宁说：“工人阶级的利益要求某一国家内的各民族的工人合并起来而成为单一的无产阶级的组织——政治的、职业的、合作社和教育的组织。只有各民族工人的这种合并而成为单一的组织，才使无产阶级有可能去跟国际资本和反动派、以及各民族的地主、教士及资产阶级民主主义者的宣传和企图作胜利的斗争。”　（民族学院研究部出版，“列宁论民族问题”六十四页）他又说：
  “万恶的专制制度的历史，把受这个专制制度压迫的各民族的工人阶级之间极大的隔阂性遗留给了我们。这种隔阂性是反专制制度斗争中最恶劣的现象和最大的障碍。我们不应当把这个万恶现象法定起来，不应当用什么党的分立性或党的‘联邦制’的‘原则’使这种恶劣现象成为神圣现象。”
  （同上书二十五页）在建立俄国布尔什维克党的时候，列宁根据这一个原则和各种民族主义分子进行了不懈的斗争，建成了苏联各民族无产阶级统一的共产党，保证了苏联民族问题的解决和社会主义多民族国家的建成和巩固。
    中国共产党是按照列宁关于建设党的学说和苏联共产党的榜样建设起来的，是我国各民族工人阶级统一的政党，各民族中的共产主义者参加了中国共产党的队伍，为在我国建设社会主义和共产主义而奋斗。中国共产党代表了我国各族人民的利益和前进的方向，领导我国各民族从胜利走向胜利，因而在各民族中，赢得了崇高的威信。
    坚持不懈地反对党内的民族主义倾向，并且以民族平等、民族友好的精神，教育人民反对一切形形色色的民族主义，是共产党之所以能够胜利地解决民族问题的一个重要的条件。资产阶级民族主义是和社会主义和无产阶级的民族观相违反的。列宁教导我们“资产阶级的民族主义和无产阶级的国际主义——这是两个不能调和的互相敌对的口号，它们是和整个资本主义世界的两大阶级营垒相适应的，并且表现出民族问题上的两种政策（甚至：两种世界观）。”（见关于民族问题的批评意见）如果不和资产阶级民族主义作斗争，民族团结便不能巩固，社会主义事业，也要受到危害。
    苏联各民族牢不可破的友谊关系是在反对和克服资产阶级民族主义的过程中发展和巩固起来的。苏联的经验证明：多民族的社会主义国家要能真正巩固起来，其中各民族的合作要能真正的亲睦起来，只有坚决彻底地克服了资产阶级民族主义的时候，才有可能。
    在我国，汉族中的大汉族主义和少数民族中的地方民族主义，都是妨害民族团结的危险倾向，毛泽东同志指出：汉族和少数民族的关系一定要搞好。这个问题的关键是克服大汉族主义。在存在有地方民族主义的少数民族中间，则应当同时克服地方民族主义。（“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”）中国共产党在反对和克服这两种民族主义方面曾经采取过许多重大的措施，于1952年和1956年两次在全国范围内进行了检查民族政策的执行情况，着重地批判了大汉族主义，同时也批判了地方民族主义，收到了一定的效果。
    当然，民族主义并不是经过几次批判就可以完全克服的。现在大汉族主义还是有的。它的主要表现是：轻视甚至歧视少数民族，不关心少数民族的需要；无视民族特点和自治权利，搬套汉族地区的工作方法和经验；在同少数民族干部合作共事中，独断专行，甚至强加于人。在少数民族中地方民族主义也是存在的，并且自从社会主义改造的高潮到来以后，在许多少数民族中，还有了新的滋长。它的主要表现是：在民族关系上，保守排外看不见各民族团结互助的重要意义，反对外来民族，特别是汉族的帮助；在国家统一的问题上，有些地方存在着企图破坏祖国统一的严重的分离主义倾向；在党的建设问题上，违背共产主义团结和统一的原则，对外来其他民族的党员采取歧视态度，特别是对外来其他民族的党员在当地组织中担任领导工作采取反对的态度。地方民族主义的滋长，反映了少数民族中的资产阶级和其它剥削阶级在社会主义不断胜利的形势下的挣扎和反抗。
    现在，中国共产党正在领导我国各族人民进行包括反对资产阶级右派在内的整风运动。这是政治战线上和思想战线上的社会主义革命，是在生产资料所有制方面的社会主义改造基本实现之后，为了巩固社会主义制度所必须采取的重大步骤。争取社会主义的彻底胜利，巩固社会主义制度，是我国各族人民当前面临的伟大历史任务，为了实现这个伟大任务，在民族问题方面，必须进行许多艰苦的经济工作、文化工作和政治思想工作，在当前加强政治、思想工作尤为重要。这里所说的政治思想工作，主要地就是和资产阶级民族主义进行坚决的斗争。过去我们强调了反对大汉族主义，是必要的。今后在存在这种倾向的地方，仍然要坚决地加以反对。由于地方民族主义在许多少数民族中有了滋长，因而在这些民族中强调反对地方民族主义，也是完全必要的。
    反对资产阶级民族主义，是当前我国正在进行的政治上和思想上的社会主义革命的内容之一，是社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争中的一个重要部分。克服资产阶级民族主义这个消极因素，进一步把我国各民族团结起来，在中国共产党的领导下，为建设各民族共同繁荣的社会主义工业化的祖国大家庭而奋斗。我们有中苏两大国牢不可破的团结，有以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结，有苏联全面无私的真诚援助，有全世界爱好和平的进步力量的支持，我们的伟大社会主义建设事业一定能够胜利。　（续完）
