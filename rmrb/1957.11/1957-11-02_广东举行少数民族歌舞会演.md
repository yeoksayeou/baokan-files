Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, October 31st: Guangdong Province's first ethnic minority performance was held in Guangzhou from October 24th to 27th. More than 200 representatives of the Li, Miao, Yao, Zhuang, She, Hui, and Man ethnic groups participated in the performance. The 88 programs performed included ancient songs and dances that had been buried for hundreds of years and were newly rediscovered, as well as newly created works praising the new China and Chairman Mao. The forms were diverse and each had its own ethnic characteristics.

In addition to performing the "March 3rd" dance praising free love, the "Wedding Dance" depicting marriage customs, and newly developed folk song male and female group singing, the talented Li representatives also performed ancient dances with hundreds of years of history. The Yue people living in the southwestern Ten Thousand Mountains of Guangdong also participated in the art performance. Their performance of "Tiao Ha" (Ha means song) is a dance that has been circulating for a long time, but no one has danced it for a long time. Recently, they found a "Ha girl" who used to "Tiao Ha" and rediscovered this ancient dance. When dancing, lit candles are placed on the head and hands, constantly twisting and changing. The dance composition and movements are very beautiful and it is one of the excellent programs in the performance. The monochord is also a unique musical instrument of theirs, which can play melodious tunes and is very popular among the local people. The old player Su Shanhui, who participated in the performance, is one of the best players. Every time after dusk, people follow the sound of the monochord to his home to enjoy the wonderful performance until they fall asleep in the sound of the music. The She people living in eastern Guangdong performed the "New Year's Dance," a dance they had not performed for more than 50 years. This time, the She people happily brought it out.

    广东举行少数民族歌舞会演
    新华社广州31日电　广东省首次少数民族观摩会演，于10月24日到27日间在广州市举行。参加会演的有黎、苗、瑶、僮、畬、回、满等民族的代表二百多人。这次演出的八十八个节目，有已经被埋没了几百年，重新发掘出来的古代歌舞；也有歌颂新中国、歌颂毛主席的新创作。形式多种多样、各具本民族的特色。
    能歌善舞的黎族代表除演出了歌颂自由恋爱的“三月三”舞、表现婚嫁习惯的“婚礼舞”和新发展起来的民歌男女声小组唱外，还演出已有几百年历史的古老舞。居住在广东西南部十万大山的越人也参加了艺术会演。他们演出的“跳哈”（哈是歌的意思）是流传了很久的舞蹈，但是早已经没有人跳了，最近他们找到了一个以前“跳哈”的“哈妹”，才把这种古老的舞蹈发掘出来。跳的时候头和手上都放上点燃着的蜡烛，不断扭动变化，舞蹈构图和动作都很优美，是会演中优秀节目之一。独弦琴也是他们一种特有的乐器，能奏出婉转美妙的乐曲，很受当地人民的喜爱，参加会演的老琴手苏善辉，是奏得最好的一个，每当黄昏过后，人们都会沿着琴声来到他家里，欣赏美妙的演奏，直到在琴声中沉沉睡去。住在粤东的畬族演出了“新年舞”，这种舞蹈他们已经有五十多年没有跳了，这次畬族人民怀着愉快的心情把它拿出来。
