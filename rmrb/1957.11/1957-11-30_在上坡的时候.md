    While Going Uphill
	Sichuan Qianjiang Cart Worker Guo Zhaoyu
    Before dawn, we a group of cart workers were sleeping soundly, when the old Wang, who was a little older, woke up first and shouted in a hoarse voice: "Get up, let's go while it's cool!" I sat up in a daze, rubbed my eyes. A kerosene lamp was lit in the room, and it was still very dark outside the window. The crowing of chickens from inside and outside the village rose and fell, as if urging us to set off.
    Once on the road, the beautiful night scene excited us: hundreds of electric lights shone with golden light, and rolls of thick smoke rose straight up from those huge chimneys, floating into the sky like clouds. Passing through the road next to the factory area, the rumbling of the machines fell behind us. Ahead was a vast night fog, and under the night fog, we could vaguely make out a road climbing up the mountain.
    We tightened our belts and tied our trouser legs, preparing to climb the slope. Everyone used all their strength, pushing and pulling, and white steam came out of our foreheads, but the carts still moved very slowly.
    Our cart team consisted of five carts, fully loaded with large and small bundles of goods. Every day we send raw materials from the countryside to the factories, and send the products produced by the factories to the countryside. Pu Yuzhang took the lead in shouting the work song, and for a while, the silent mountains became lively and vibrant.
    Old Yuan and I were on one cart. I pulled in the front, and he pushed in the back; because the wheels had a problem, it didn't go fast. Although we used all our strength, we still fell behind the carts in front for a distance. The partners in front were also two people to a cart, so of course they couldn't spare any effort to help us. They turned their heads and shouted: "Guys, pull slowly, we'll go to the top of the slope and come back to pick you up."
    The partners went ahead, leaving behind the vast fog and the road. We pulled desperately, sweat pouring down, and our clothes were soaked. At this time, it seemed that someone was walking under the shade of the trees on the other side of the road. As they got closer, we could roughly make out an old cow and a herdboy. When the herdboy saw that we were having a hard time, he immediately ran over and said, "Uncles, let me help you push!" Old Yuan was really as if he had been rescued from a crisis, and he quickly said, "Okay, kid, come and push here!" He gestured to the herdboy: "To push a cart, you should do it like this, keep your arms straight, so you have strength, and you won't get tired!"
    As the saying goes, "Even a chicken has a little strength"; with the help of that child, I was able to relax a lot in the front, and the cart moved faster. The night fog gradually dissipated, the east turned white, and before long, we caught up with the carts in front.
    At the top of the slope, the east was red, and thousands of rays of light poured out from the edge of the sky, and our faces were all flushed. We rested, and the carts stopped on the flat ground at the top of the slope. When I looked back, the herdboy said, "Uncles, I have to go back, the cow is still over there, goodbye." At this time, we saw clearly that he had a red scarf tied around his neck, he was a Young Pioneer. I repeatedly said, "Thank you, Red Scarf! Thank you!" While running down the slope, he waved his little hand and said, "Uncles, this is nothing,..." He ran far away, and I still don't know his name!

    在上坡的时候	四川黔江板车工人　郭兆毓
    天还未亮，我们一伙板车工人睡得正香，上了点年纪的老王头先醒了，就破着嗓子直嚷：“起来哟，趁天凉好走！”我糊里糊涂地坐了起来，揉了揉眼睛，屋内点着一盏煤油灯，窗外还黑得很。村里村外的鸡声此起彼落，像在催促我们上路。
    上了路，美丽的夜景使我们兴奋：数百盏电灯闪耀着金光，一卷卷浓烟从那些巨大的烟囱里往上直冒，飘到天空像云块一样。穿过工厂区旁边的公路，??的机器声落在了后边。前面是茫茫的夜雾，夜雾底下隐隐约约可以辨出一条往山上爬去的公路。
    我们紧了紧裤腰带，扎了扎裤脚管，准备爬坡。大家使足劲，推的推，拉的拉，额上都冒出了白气，车儿还是走得很慢。
    我们的板车一行五辆，车上满载着大捆小捆的货物。我们天天把农村的原料送给工厂，把工厂生产出的东西送给农村。蒲玉章带头喊起了号子，一时，寂静的山野就变得热闹了，活泼了。
    我和老袁一辆板车。我在前面拖，他在后面推；因为车轮有毛病，走得不快，尽管我们使出了全身气力，仍然和前面的板车拉了一段路。前面的伙伴也是两人一车，当然抽不出身来帮我们。他们扭过头来喊道：“伙计，你们慢慢拉，我们上了坡头，再回来接你们。”
    伙伴们上前去了，落在前面的是茫茫的雾和路。我俩拼命地拉，汗水直流，浑身衣服都湿透了。这时，路那边树荫道下似乎有人在走动。近些了，才大略辨出是一只老牛和一个牧童。那牧童看到我们很吃力，他马上跑过来说：“叔叔，我来帮你们推！”老袁这下子真如急难里得了救兵一样，忙说：“好，小朋友，来，推这儿！”他给牧童比划着：“推车，应这样，手要打直，才有劲，人也不会吃亏！”
    俗话说得好：“一个鸡四两力”；有了那小朋友的帮助，我在前面松了好大一个劲，车儿也走得快了。夜雾渐渐散去，东方发白了，没多一阵，我们赶上了前面的板车。
    上得坡头，东方红了，挨着天边涌出了万道霞光，我们的脸膛都透着红。休息了，车停在坡头的平地上。我回过头去，那牧童才说：“叔叔，我该回去了，牛还在那边呢，再见吧。”这时我们才看清他颈上结了一条红领巾，是个少先队员。我连说：“谢谢你，红领巾！谢谢你！”他一边往坡下跑，一边挥着小手说：“叔叔，这不算什么，……”他跑远了，我还不知道他叫什么名字呢！
