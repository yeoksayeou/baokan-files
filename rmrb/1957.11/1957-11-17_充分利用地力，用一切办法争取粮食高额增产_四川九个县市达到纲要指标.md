Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, November 16th. Nine counties (cities) in Sichuan Province have reached and surpassed the target of 800 jin of grain per mu set by the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) ten years ahead of schedule. These nine counties (cities) are: Pi County, Xinfan, Xindu, Wenjiang, Shuangliu, Guanghan, Mianzhu, Luxian, and the suburban area of ​​Chengdu. Among them, Pi County has the highest yield, with 1,083 jin per mu; Xinfan, Xindu, and the suburban area of ​​Chengdu have yields of over 900 jin per mu; the remaining five counties all exceeded 800 jin per mu.

As early as last year, Pi County, Xinfan, Xindu, and the suburban area of ​​Chengdu among these nine counties (cities) had an average yield of over 800 jin per mu. Wenjiang and three other counties produced more than 700 jin per mu, and Shuangliu County produced 688 jin per mu. The main reason why these nine counties (cities) can achieve large-scale agricultural bumper harvests this year is that the local agricultural cooperatives, based on the local favorable natural conditions, have increased the multiple cropping index of cultivated land, making full use of land fertility and using every means to increase grain production. The agricultural cooperatives in Luxian County, based on the local characteristics of warm climate and abundant rainfall, expanded the area of ​​double-cropping rice to 570,000 mu, accounting for 54% of the county's paddy field area. Many winter paddy fields that used to be planted only once a year were planted twice this year; some two-season fields were planted three times. Farmers in Wenjiang, Pi County and other counties, based on the superior conditions of convenient water conservancy and fertile land in the western Sichuan Plain, carried out a large number of intercropping, mixed cropping, and additional cropping to expand the multiple cropping area of ​​cultivated land. The multiple cropping index in Pi County reached 227.9%, and the grain produced by multiple cropping accounted for 54.1% of the county's total grain increase. Agricultural cooperatives in various places have also strived to increase the yield per unit area by increasing fertilizer application and adopting various advanced farming methods.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, November 16th. Chao'an County in Guangdong Province, the first county in China to achieve a per-mu yield of 1,000 jin of rice, is currently experiencing vigorous late rice growth. It is estimated that the average yield of the 310,000 mu of grain crops sown in the county this year can reach 1,233 jin per mu, an increase of 5.8% compared with 1956. In total, during the first five-year plan period, the grain yield per unit area in the county increased by 45%.

Chao'an County became the first 1,000-jin rice county in the country in 1955, and the grain yield per unit area had already reached 1,064 jin at that time. It is very difficult to continue to rise at an average annual growth rate of about 8% at such a high level.

The fundamental experience of increasing production in Chao'an County: one is to increase the unit harvest of each crop, and the other is to increase the multiple cropping index of cultivated land.

The main methods for Chao'an County to increase the unit harvest are to eliminate various diseases and insect pests and carry out agricultural technical reforms. In the past two years, technical reforms have gradually expanded from rice cultivation to other crops. The planting density of crops such as barley, wheat, and broad beans has been improved, and broadcasting has been changed to row planting or dense planting.

Chao'an County mainly relies on expanding the winter planting area and promoting intercropping and mixed cropping to increase the multiple cropping index. In the past two years, the winter planting area of ​​this county has expanded by a total of 31,400 mu, and wheat, broad beans, and Dutch beans have been promoted for intercropping or mixed cropping on the sweet potato cultivated land harvested in spring. Therefore, the multiple cropping index of grain cultivated land in the county this year has increased from 235% in 1955 to 264%. The grain produced by increasing the multiple cropping index is much more than that obtained by increasing the harvest of each crop.

    充分利用地力，用一切办法争取粮食高额增产
    四川九个县市达到纲要指标
    广东潮安县今年每亩粮食产量可达一千二百多斤
    新华社成都16日电  四川省有九个县（市）提前十年达到并超过全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）所定的每亩产粮食八百斤的指标。这九个县（市）是：郫县、新繁、新都、温江、双流、广汉、绵竹、泸县和成都市郊区。其中郫县产量最高，每亩产一千零八十三斤；新繁、新都、成都市郊区，每亩产量在九百斤以上；其余五县的产量，每亩都超过了八百斤。
    还在去年，这九个县（市）中的郫县、新繁、新都和成都市郊区，平均每亩产量就达到八百斤以上。温江等三县每亩产七百多斤，双流县每亩六百八十八斤。这九个县（市）今年能获得农业大面积丰产的主要原因是：各地农业社根据当地有利的自然条件，提高了耕地复种指数，作到充分利用地力，用一切办法增加粮食产量。泸县的农业社，根据当地气候温暖、雨量充沛等特点，将双季稻的面积扩大到五十七万亩，占到全县稻田面积的54％。许多往年只种一季的冬水田，今年种了两季；有些两季田则种了三季。温江、郫县等县的农民，根据川西平原水利方便、土地肥沃等优越条件，大量进行了套种、间种、增种等，扩大了耕地复种面积。郫县的复种指数达到227．9％，由于复种而增产的粮食占这个县全年粮食增产量的54．1％。各地农业社还通过增施肥料，采用各种先进耕作方法等，来努力提高单位面积产量。
    新华社广州16日电  我国最先达到水稻亩产量千斤的广东省潮安县目前晚稻生长旺盛，预计今年全县播种的三十一万多亩粮食作物，平均每亩产量可以达到一千二百三十三斤，比1956年增加5．8％。总计在第一个五年计划期间，全县粮食单位面积产量增加了45％。
    潮安县是在1955年成为全国第一个水稻千斤县的，粮食单位面积产量当时已经达到一千零六十四斤，在这样高的水平上，能够以平均每年增产8％左右的速度继续上升是很不容易的。
    潮安县增产的根本经验：一个是提高每一造的单位收获量，另一个是提高耕地的复种指数。
    潮安县提高单位收获量的主要办法是消除各种病虫害，进行农业技术改革。两年来，技术改革已从水稻栽培逐步扩展到其他作物。改善了大麦、小麦、蚕豆等作物的密植规格，把撒播改为条播或密播。
    潮安县提高复种指数，主要靠扩大冬种面积，推广间种和套种。两年来，这个县的冬种面积总共扩大了三万一千四百亩，在春收甘薯耕地上推广间种或套种小麦、蚕豆和荷兰豆。因此今年全县粮食耕地的复种指数已从1955年的235％提高到264％。由于提高复种指数而增产的粮食，比提高每一造的收获量所得的要多得多。
