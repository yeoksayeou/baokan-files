Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 12th November: Yesterday, November 12th, was the Greening Zhengzhou Blitz Day. Zhengzhou city's cadres, students and officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Zhengzhou conducted the largest voluntary labor campaign since liberation in the afternoon. More than ten thousand people gathered in the sandy forest area on the northern outskirts of Zhengzhou—the south bank of the Yellow River—planting more than 80,000 trees.

Since 1956, Zhengzhou city’s cadres, students, and citizens have used voluntary labor to create Youth Forests, Women's Forests, and Public Security Fighters' Forests in the suburbs of Zhengzhou, planting more than 120,000 trees. The city's youth also built a Youth Lake in People's Park, excavating more than 40,000 cubic meters of earth. This winter, relevant departments in Zhengzhou plan to mobilize cadres, students, and others to use voluntary labor to build fifteen urban roads.
