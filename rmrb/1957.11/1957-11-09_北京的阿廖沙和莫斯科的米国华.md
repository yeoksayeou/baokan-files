Alyosha of Beijing and Miguo Hua of Moscow
He Yi

The two children are such good friends, they miss each other even in their dreams; they have shared many intimate thoughts, but have never met. One is in Moscow, one is in Beijing, separated by thousands of mountains and rivers. They have exchanged many letters and souvenirs, and what connects the children's hearts is the line of friendship.

Misha in Moscow has a Chinese name called Miguo Hua, and Liu Li in Beijing is also called Alyosha. Choosing a foreign name is not for novelty or fun. Their love for the Soviet Union and their love for China are truly indescribable!

The two children are familiar with each other's families, as if they lived next door. Even if the little sister of Alyosha from China knocks out a tooth, someone in Moscow is concerned.

Miguo Hua suddenly wants to learn to eat with chopsticks, because he has made a great ambition: when he grows up, he wants to go to Alyosha's motherland, just like the many uncles he knows. Alyosha in Beijing is also determined to learn Russian. The first word he learned was "Tovarishch" (Comrade), and on every letter sent to Moscow, he carefully added this respectful title after "Miguo Hua."

The two children are such good friends, they miss each other even in their dreams; they have shared many intimate thoughts, but have never met.

    北京的阿廖沙和莫斯科的米国华
    贺宜两个孩子是这样的好朋友，好得梦里也想念；谈过不少知心话，不过没见过一次面。一个在莫斯科，一个在北京，千重山万条水路隔得远，信件和纪念品交换了不少，把孩子的心连在一起的是友谊的线。莫斯科的米霞有一个中国名叫米国华，北京的刘力又叫阿廖沙，取个外国名字并不为了新奇有趣，对苏联的爱，对中国的爱，实在难描难
    画！两个孩子熟悉彼此的家，就像他们在紧邻住下，那怕中国阿廖沙的妹妹磕了一颗门牙，莫斯科也有人惦挂。米国华忽然要学用筷吃饭，原来他立下了一个大志愿：长大了要到阿廖沙的祖国去，就跟他知道的许多叔叔一样。北京的阿廖沙也立志要学俄文，学会的第一个字是“大瓦力士基”，每一封寄莫斯科的信上，都用心在“米国华”的后面加上这尊称。两个孩子是这样的好朋友，好得梦里也想念，谈过不少知心话，不过没见过一次面。
