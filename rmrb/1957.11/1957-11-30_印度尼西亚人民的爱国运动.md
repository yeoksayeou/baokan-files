    Indonesian People's Patriotic Movement Zhang Xuemei
    Since the current UN General Assembly adopted the inclusion of the West Irian issue on its agenda in September, the nationwide patriotic movement of the Indonesian people demanding the recovery of West Irian has surged even higher. Starting from "Youth Pledge Day" on October 28th, people across the country held demonstrations and rallies to recover West Irian. Slogans such as "Recover West Irian!" and "Expel Dutch Colonialists!" were plastered on the walls, windows, around the residences, and on the cars of Dutch-run enterprises. A torchlight procession of 100,000 people organized by all sectors of Jakarta passed by the residence of the Dutch diplomatic representative to Indonesia, burning a paper effigy symbolizing Dutch colonialism, demonstrating the determination to completely destroy colonial rule.
    Under President Sukarno's repeated call for national unity to fight for the recovery of West Irian, a broad national unity has formed within Indonesia. Seventeen members of parliament from the Indonesian Nationalist Party, Masyumi Party, Islamic Teachers Association, Indonesian Communist Party, Catholic Party, Christian Party, and progressive factions jointly expressed their full support for the delegation's struggle at the United Nations. Youth groups from the four major political parties in Indonesia and the Army formed a cooperation organization, launching a nationwide "West Irian Movement Week." At a joint meeting held by the Indonesian Army and Youth Cooperation Organization with various trade union organizations in Indonesia under the auspices of the government, it was unanimously decided to maintain close unity and cooperation among workers, youth, and military authorities to strengthen the struggle to recover West Irian. On November 8th, a mass rally of one million people was held in Jakarta. On the 25th, as the Political Committee of the UN General Assembly discussed the West Irian issue, the entire city of Jakarta stopped working for five minutes, bells and drums rang throughout the city, and the sound of factory and locomotive whistles echoed through the clear sky, igniting the raging anger against the colonialists in people's hearts.
    The people of West Irian, who are at the forefront of the opposition to Dutch colonial rule, are even more indignant. A person who escaped from West Irian told an Antara News Agency reporter that the anti-Dutch activities on various islands and the activities on the West Irian mainland maintain good contact. Under the leadership of the Indonesian Irian Liberation Movement and the Indonesian Irian Independence Party, the people of West Irian have been engaged in arduous underground struggles. In major cities, a large number of leaflets are found almost every night, calling for attacks on the Dutch colonial army and striving to return to the embrace of Indonesia. According to a recent report by Antara News Agency, in order to coordinate with the struggle at the United Nations, the people of West Irian are preparing to launch an uprising to resist Dutch colonial rule.
    In order to recover its sacred territory, Indonesia has conducted several direct negotiations with the Dutch authorities since 1950. Because the Netherlands insisted on its colonialist position, several negotiations failed. The Indonesian government had to submit the West Irian issue to the United Nations for resolution. However, since 1954, although the United Nations has discussed it three times, no effective decision has been made on the West Irian issue due to the collusion between the Dutch colonialists and Western colonial countries to obstruct it. In November this year, the Political Committee of the 12th UN General Assembly began to discuss the West Irian issue again. Due to the unwavering determination of the Indonesian people, and with the support of Asian-African countries, socialist countries, and some Latin American countries, the Political Committee of the UN General Assembly passed a joint proposal on November 26th by eighteen Asian-African countries including Ceylon and Bolivia of Latin America, requesting the Netherlands and Indonesia to hold new negotiations on the West Irian issue, and entrusting UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld to provide assistance. This proposal is now being prepared for submission to the plenary session of the United Nations General Assembly for adoption.
    The main reason why the West Irian issue has not been resolved for a long time is because the United States is backing the Netherlands behind the scenes. As early as 1950, Truman had agreed to establish a strong military base in West Irian as a US military base in the Pacific. Therefore, when Indonesia began negotiations with the Netherlands, the United States instigated the Netherlands not to make concessions. In 1955, when the UN General Assembly was discussing the West Irian issue, the United States handed over 200 jet fighters to the Netherlands, further fueling the arrogance of the Dutch colonialists.
    In recent years, with Washington's backing, the Dutch colonialists have further expanded the construction of military bases in West Irian. Fourteen small airports and a large naval base have already been built, and a modern airport is also planned to be built on "Sukarno Peak." According to a report by the New York correspondent of the "Delhi Times": "The Netherlands has agreed with the United States to jointly use the Koba and Sorong military bases currently under construction in West Irian," attempting to use the US military force to suppress the anti-colonial movement in West Irian.
    The United States abstained from voting on the West Irian issue at every UN General Assembly to obstruct the passage of the proposal, and openly rejected the Indonesian government's request for assistance. After the Netherlands and Australia issued a joint statement on close cooperation in governing East and West Irian, "The Washington Post and Times Herald" wrote even more bluntly: "If the United States in the past had compelling reasons to often abstain from voting on the West Irian issue at the United Nations, it now has a good opportunity to oppose this request."
    Despite the Dutch colonialists' painstaking efforts to collude everywhere, and despite the multifaceted sabotage and obstruction by the United States, the Indonesian people's determination to recover West Irian cannot be shaken by any force. President Sukarno said it well, "The struggle to recover West Irian does not depend on New York, but on Indonesia." President Sukarno has repeatedly pointed out at recent mass rallies to recover West Irian that if the method of resolving the West Irian issue through the United Nations fails, all Dutch property in Indonesia will be confiscated, and trade relations with the Netherlands are prepared to be severed if necessary. Indonesian public opinion also unanimously advocates that if the Netherlands continues to occupy West Irian, diplomatic relations should be severed immediately, all Dutch property in Indonesia should be confiscated, and all Dutch economic privileges in Indonesia should be terminated.
    The Indonesian people's struggle to recover West Irian is not only a struggle to strive for territorial sovereignty and integrity, but also a component of the struggle to defend world peace and the world's anti-colonial struggle. Their struggle has won the sympathy and support of peace-loving and freedom-loving people all over the world. With the unity of the entire Indonesian people and all patriotic forces, coupled with the support of the world's peace forces and anti-colonial forces, the Indonesian people's struggle to demand the recovery of West Irian will surely be victorious.

    印度尼西亚人民的爱国运动	张雪美
    自从本届联大在9月间通过把西伊里安问题列入议程以来，印度尼西亚人民要求收复西伊里安的全国性的爱国主义运动更加高涨了。从10月28日“青年宣誓日”开始，全国各地人民举行了收复西伊里安的示威游行和集会，在荷兰人开办的企业的墙上、橱窗上、住宅周围以及汽车上贴满了“收复西伊里安！”“驱逐荷兰殖民者！”等标语。雅加达各阶层组织的十万人火炬游行队伍，经过荷兰驻印度尼西亚外交代表的住宅时，焚烧了一个象征荷兰殖民主义者的纸扎的人像，显示了彻底摧毁殖民统治的决心。
    在苏加诺总统一再号召全国团结一致，为收复西伊里安而奋斗的口号下，印度尼西亚国内形成了广泛的民族大团结。印度尼西亚国民党、马斯友美党、伊斯兰教师联合会、印度尼西亚共产党、天主教党、基督教党和进步系等党派的十七个议员，联名表示全力支持代表团在联合国的斗争。印度尼西亚四大政党的青年团体和陆军组成合作组织，发起了全国范围的“西伊里安运动周”。在政府主持下召开的印度尼西亚陆军和青年合作组织同印度尼西亚各工会组织举行的联席会议上，一致决定在工人、青年和军事当局之间保持密切的团结合作，以加强收复西伊里安的斗争。11月8日，雅加达举行了一百万人的群众大会。25日，正当联大政委会讨论西伊里安问题时，雅加达全市停止工作五分钟，市内钟鼓齐鸣，工厂和机车汽笛声响彻晴空，人们的心头燃起了反抗殖民主义者的熊熊怒火。
    处在反对荷兰殖民统治最前线的西伊里安人民，更是群情激愤。一位从西伊里安逃出来的人士，对安塔拉通讯社记者说，各岛屿的反荷活动和西伊里安本土的活动保持着良好的联系。在印度尼西亚伊里安解放运动和印度尼西亚伊里安独立党的领导下，西伊里安人民进行了艰苦的地下斗争。在各大城市里，几乎每晚都发现大量传单，号召打击荷兰殖民军和争取回到印度尼西亚的怀抱。据安塔拉通讯社最近报道，为了配合在联合国的斗争，西伊里安人民准备举行起义，反抗荷兰殖民统治。
    印度尼西亚为了收复自己的这块神圣领土，从1950年起便和荷兰当局进行了几次直接谈判。由于荷兰坚持殖民主义立场，几次谈判都没有成功。印度尼西亚政府不得不将西伊里安问题提交联合国解决。但是，从1954年以来，虽经过联合国三次讨论，都由于荷兰殖民者和西方殖民国家互相勾结从中阻挠，没有就西伊里安问题作出任何有效决定。今年11月第十二届联大政委会又开始讨论西伊里安问题。由于印度尼西亚人民表示了坚定不移的决心，由于亚非国家、社会主义国家和一部分拉丁美洲国家的支持，联大政委会于11月26日通过了锡兰等十八个亚非国家和拉丁美洲玻利维亚的联合提案，要求荷兰和印度尼西亚就西伊里安问题重新举行谈判，并且责成联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德给予帮助。现在这个提案正准备提交联合国大会全体会议通过。
    西伊里安问题之长期不能解决，重要原因是由于美国在幕后给荷兰撑腰。远在1950年，杜鲁门就曾商定在西伊里安建立强大的军事基地，作为美国在太平洋的军事根据地。所以，在印度尼西亚同荷兰开始谈判时，美国就唆使荷兰不要让步。1955年正当联大讨论西伊里安问题之际，美国将两百架喷气式战斗机交给荷兰，更助长了荷兰殖民者的气焰。
    近几年来，由于有华盛顿的后台，荷兰殖民者更在西伊里安扩大军事基地的建筑。已经建成的有十四个小型飞机场和一个大的海军根据地，还准备在“苏加诺峰”修建现代化大机场。另据“德里时报”驻纽约记者报道：“荷兰同意和美国一起使用正在西伊里安修建的科巴和梭弄军事基地”，企图利用美国的军事力量镇压西伊里安的反殖民主义运动。
    美国在每次联大表决西伊里安问题时，都以弃权来阻挠提案的通过，并且公开拒绝印度尼西亚政府对它提出的援助要求。在荷兰和澳大利亚发表关于在统治东、西伊里安方面实行密切合作的联合声明之后，“华盛顿邮报和时代先驱报”更加露骨地写道：“如果说美国过去有迫不得已的理由常常在联合国表决西伊里安问题时弃权的话，现在就有反对这个要求的良好机会了。”
    尽管荷兰殖民者处心积虑地到处张罗串连，尽管美国多方面的破坏和阻挠，印度尼西亚人民收复西伊里安的决心是任何力量也动摇不了的。苏加诺总统说得好，“收复西伊里安的斗争不是取决于纽约，而是取决于印度尼西亚”。苏加诺总统在最近几次收复西伊里安群众大会上一再指出：如果通过联合国来解决西伊里安问题的办法宣告失败，荷兰在印度尼西亚的一切财产将被没收，在必要时还准备和荷兰断绝贸易关系。印度尼西亚的舆论也一致主张：如果荷兰继续霸占西伊里安，应立即和它断绝外交关系，没收荷兰在印度尼西亚的一切财产，结束荷兰在印度尼西亚的一切经济特权。
    印度尼西亚人民收复西伊里安的斗争，不仅是为了争取领土主权完整的斗争，而且是保卫世界和平和世界反殖民主义斗争的一个组成部分。他们的斗争已获得了全世界爱好和平与自由人民的同情和支持。有了印度尼西亚全国人民和一切爱国力量的团结一致，再加上全世界的和平力量与反殖民主义力量的支持，印度尼西亚人民要求收复西伊里安的斗争一定会胜利的。
