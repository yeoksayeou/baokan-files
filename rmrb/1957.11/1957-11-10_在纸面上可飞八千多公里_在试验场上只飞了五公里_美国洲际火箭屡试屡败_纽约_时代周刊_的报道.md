Title: Can Fly Over 8,000 Kilometers on Paper, But Only Five Kilometers at the Test Site: US Intercontinental Rocket Repeatedly Fails

Xinhua News Agency, 9th dispatch: The American "Time" magazine recently published an eyewitness account of the second failed test launch of the so-called intercontinental missile by the United States two days before the Soviet Union launched its first artificial satellite. As everyone knows, the Soviet Union announced the completion of the intercontinental ballistic rocket in August. Now, two artificial satellites have been sent into space by rockets. The altitude of the first satellite launched by the Soviet Union in early October reached 900 kilometers, but the second test launch of the American "Atlas" intercontinental missile only flew five kilometers before it failed.

    "Time" magazine reported: One dark night in early October, more than two hundred American missile personnel gathered at the missile test base. They looked haggard with sunken eyes and unshaven beards due to days of hard work. After a final flurry of activity, they finally managed to prepare the second, largest American missile, "Atlas," for testing.

    On paper, the "Atlas" is said to be able to fly more than 8,000 kilometers. But in June of this year, it only flew erratically for twenty-two seconds over the test base before ground-based safety officials had to press the button to destroy it in the air.

    This time, the second "Atlas" seemed obedient at first. But when it had risen for about twenty seconds, the black smoke from its tail suddenly became too thick, its entire body trembled, and it began to swerve wildly. Its internal jet turbine pump could no longer supply the correct mixed fuel, and because its 300,000 components and instruments were too fragile, they could no longer be adjusted. Thus, this giant missile failed again. An American safety official, seeing through his telescope that the missile had flown to a height of about five kilometers above the ground and was outside the safety zone, had to press the button as a matter of routine. Suddenly, a violent explosion engulfed the missile, and in an instant, the piece of equipment worth six million dollars was reduced to scrap metal and a wisp of white smoke in the sky.

    An American missile expert, with a worried expression, quipped, "As a surgeon said, the operation was successful, but the patient died."

### 在纸面上可飞八千多公里  在试验场上只飞了五公里  美国洲际火箭屡试屡败  纽约“时代周刊”的报道

    在纸面上可飞八千多公里
    在试验场上只飞了五公里
    美国洲际火箭屡试屡败
    纽约“时代周刊”的报道
    新华社9日讯　美国“时代周刊”不久前刊载了一篇美国在苏联发射第一个人造卫星前两天第二次试射所谓洲际导弹失败的目击记。大家知道，苏联8月间就宣布制成了洲际弹道火箭。现在已经有两个人造卫星被火箭送上天空运行。苏联10月初发射的第一个卫星的高度就达九百公里，可是美国的“阿特拉斯”洲际导弹第二次试射飞上五公里就完蛋了。
    “时代周刊”的报道说：10月初的一个黑夜里，两百多美国导弹人员聚集在导弹试验基地上。他们因为多日的忙碌而显得眼睛深陷，胡须满腮，最后忙了一阵，终算把这第二枚美国最大的导弹“阿特拉斯”服侍稳妥，准备试射了。
    在纸面上，“阿特拉斯”据说可以飞八千多公里远。但是今年6月间，它在试验基地上空只乱飞了二十二秒钟，最后不得不由地上的安全官员揿了电钮，使它在空中爆毁了。
    这一次，第二枚“阿特拉斯”刚起飞时，似乎还听话。可当它是上升了约二十秒钟的时候，尾部的黑烟突然变得太浓，全身发抖，开始乱窜起来。它内部的喷射涡轮唧筒已经不能供应正确的混合燃料，而且由于它的三十万件零碎机件和仪器太脆弱了，已经不能再加以调整。就这样，这颗巨型导弹又算告吹。美国一个安全官员从望远镜里看到这颗导弹已经飞上离地面约五公里的高处，出了安全地区，又不得不例行公事似地按了一下电钮。突然间，一团剧烈爆炸的火焰裹住了那颗导弹，一下子，那枚价达六百万美元的货色，只剩下一些碎铁片和留在天际的一阵白烟了。
    一个美国导弹专家愁眉苦脸地解嘲说，“正像一外科医生说过的，这次手术是成功的，可就是病人死了。”
