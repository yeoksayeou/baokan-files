    Shangyangban Village in Yushan County, Jiangxi Province, used to be a place where schistosomiasis was severely prevalent. Before liberation, it was known by the people of neighboring villages as the "Widow Village."

    Twenty years ago, Shangyangban Village was once a prosperous village with over a hundred households and more than four hundred people. Over the past twenty years, due to the prevalence of schistosomiasis, the population has drastically decreased. By the time of liberation, only forty-odd households and a little over one hundred people remained. Among the surviving forty-odd households, there were twenty-seven widows. Near the village was a piece of land, which the local people called "Coffin Field" because of the abundance of snails, and no one dared to cultivate it. There is no end to the sorrowful tales of schistosomiasis in the past. In the Li family row of this village, there used to live five brothers, all of whom were married and had children. Each of them was strong and healthy, and the local people called them the "Five Tigers." The whole family numbered more than twenty people. However, after being infected with schistosomiasis, some died, some fled, and only two descendants remained. Therefore, before liberation, the production here was withering, the houses were dilapidated, and the scene was utterly miserable. And the reactionary rulers at that time did not care about this situation at all.

    After liberation, the Communist Party and the People's Government vigorously launched schistosomiasis prevention and control work. Now, the face of this village has undergone fundamental changes. According to a survey at the end of 1953, every one of the forty-seven households in the village had schistosomiasis patients. Out of the total population of one hundred and forty-eight, one hundred and thirteen were infected. Now, they are generally cured, and the labor force has increased from fourteen in the past to forty-eight. Young farmer Ke Shumaom, who used to be unable to work due to schistosomiasis and had even begged for food, can now carry a load of more than a hundred catties after being cured. This year, he earned more than two thousand work points, his family raised a pig, and they also have savings. In the past, there were five couples in the village who could not have children after marriage due to schistosomiasis. After being cured, they all had children. Speaking of this, sixty-six-year-old Zhu Xiuying is the happiest. She herself had given birth to sixteen children, fourteen of whom died of schistosomiasis. Her surviving son, Fang Saigou, is now thirty-six years old. He had been married for many years but could not have children due to schistosomiasis. After being cured in May 1955, he had a child in July last year. Now, there are no more young widows in the village.

    Due to the changes in the health of the masses, the production of this village has greatly developed. The seventeen mu of "Coffin Field," which had been barren for more than ten years, has also been developed after large-scale snail eradication. This year, it yielded more than two thousand catties of grain. At the time of liberation, the average yield per mu in the village was only one hundred and eighty catties, but last year it increased to three hundred and sixty catties. This year, the average income per person in the village has reached one hundred and ten yuan. Among the thirty houses in the village, ten are newly built, and eight of the remaining twenty have been repaired or expanded. In the past, there was not a single primary school student in the village, but this year there are eighteen primary school students. Now, the agricultural cooperative in the village has also made plans to eliminate snails by the end of this year, so as to achieve the requirements of the Agricultural Development Program for the elimination of schistosomiasis ten years ahead of schedule.

    青春回到了“寡妇村”
    新华社记者　彭江流
    江西玉山县上洋坂村，过去是血吸虫病严重流行的地方，解放前被邻近村庄的群众称作“寡妇村”。
    上洋坂村在二十年前，曾经是一个上百户、四百多口人的兴旺的村庄；二十年来，因为血吸虫病的流行，人口大量死亡，到解放时只剩下四十多户、一百多口，在仅存的四十多户中，就有二十七个寡妇。村附近有一块田，因为钉螺太多，当地群众叫它作“棺材田”，谁也不敢在那里耕种。对于过去血吸虫病为害的伤心话，是说不完的。这个村的李家排，过去住着五兄弟，都娶了亲、生了孩子，个个身强体壮，当地群众称他们兄弟为“五老虎”，全家计有二十几口人；可是后来因感染了血吸虫病，死的死、亡的亡，只剩下了他们的两个后代。因此，解放前，这里是生产雕零，房屋东倒西歪，一片悲惨景象。而当时的反动统治者对这种情况是毫不关心的。
    解放后，共产党和人民政府大力展开了血吸虫病防治工作，现在，这个村的面貌已有了根本的改变。据1953年底调查，全村四十七户，每户都有血吸虫病患者，全村一百四十八口，患者一百一十三口。现在一般都治好了，劳动力由过去的十四个增加到四十八个。青年农民柯书毛，过去因患血吸虫病，不能劳动，曾经讨过饭；治好病以后，能挑一百多斤重的担子，今年作了二千多个工分，家里养了一头猪，还有存款。过去村里有五对夫妇，因患血吸虫病婚后不能生育，治好病以后，都生了孩子。谈起这事，要算六十六岁的朱秀英最高兴。她自己曾经生育过十六个儿女，十四个死于血吸虫病。她的活着的儿子方腮狗，今年已经三十六岁，结婚多年，因患血吸虫病，没有生育，1955年5月治好病以后，去年7月就生了一个小孩。现在，村里再没有年轻的寡妇了。
    由于群众健康情况的改变，这个村的生产已有很大的发展。过去荒芜了十几年的十七亩“棺材田”，在大规模的进行了消灭钉螺后，也被开发出来了，今年收获了两千多斤谷子。解放时，村里每亩地平均产量只一百八十斤，去年提高到三百六十斤。今年村里每个人的平均收入，达到一百一十元。全村三十栋房屋中，有十栋是新建造的，其余的二十栋，也有八栋经过了修理或扩充。过去全村没有一个小学生，今年有十八个小学生了。现在村里的农业社又作出了规划，要在今年年底消灭钉螺，这样就可提前十年实现农业发展纲要消灭血吸虫病的要求。
