Xinhua News Agency, 8th. The National Plant Protection and Quarantine Work Conference held by the Ministry of Agriculture in Beijing concluded on the 5th. The conference decided to basically eliminate rice stem borers and other pests and cotton bollworms, cotton aphids and other pests during the Second Five-Year Plan. We must vigorously carry out prevention and control work for wheat gall midges, sweet potato black spot, and vegetable and fruit tree diseases and insect pests that endanger wheat growth.

In order to adapt to the requirements of vigorously developing agricultural production, the conference proposed that the national pest and disease control tasks for next year should be expanded by 65% compared with this year, including a sixteen-fold expansion of the area for thorough prevention and control. The main targets for prevention and control are diseases and insect pests of grain and cotton crops, and at the same time, diseases and insect pests of livestock and crops in mountainous areas and grasslands should be prevented and controlled to ensure the breeding of livestock and the prosperity of production in mountainous areas. Grasshopper control must be done better than in previous years. We must further carry out plant quarantine work.

In the past five years, great achievements have been made in preventing and controlling grain and cotton diseases and insect pests. The area treated with pesticides has increased from 48 million mu in 1953 to 500 million mu in 1957. The cumulative area over five years is approximately 1.6 billion mu, and it is estimated that 15.7 billion jin of grain loss and 4.2 million dan of ginned cotton have been recovered. In recent years, plant protection work has expanded from the prevention and control of grain and cotton diseases and insect pests to economic crop diseases and insect pests and bird and animal pests; from the prevention and control of diseases and insect pests in plains to diseases and insect pests in mountainous and grassland areas. There has also been rapid progress in prevention and control technology.

    全国防治病虫害成绩很大
    新华社8日讯　农业部在北京召开的全国植物保护及植物检疫工作会议5日结束。会议决定在第二个五年计划期间基本消灭水稻中的螟虫等害虫和棉花中的红铃虫、棉蚜等害虫。关于危害小麦生长的吸浆虫、甘薯的黑斑病，以及蔬菜、果树的病虫害等，都要大力开展防治工作。
    为了适应大力发展农业生产的要求，会议提出：明年全国病虫害防治任务要比今年扩大65％，其中彻底防治面积扩大十六倍。防治对象主要是粮、棉作物的病虫害，同时要防治山区、草原牲畜和农作物的病虫害，保证牲畜的繁殖和山区生产的繁荣。对于治蝗一定要做得比往年更好。并要进一步开展植物检疫工作。
    五年来，防治粮棉病虫害的成绩很大，药剂防治面积由1953年的四千八百万亩增加到1957年的五亿亩。五年累计约十六亿亩，估计挽回粮食损失一百五十七亿斤，皮棉四百二十万担。几年来植物保护工作已从防治粮、棉病虫害扩大到经济作物病虫害和鸟兽害；从防治平原的病虫害扩大到山区草原的病虫害。防治技术上也有了较快的进步。
