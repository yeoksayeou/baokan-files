    Let Mountainous and Dam Areas Prosper Together
    By Our Correspondent Zhang Jiechun

    Mountainous areas need to develop production, but the development of production in mountainous areas must take into account various different conditions.

    Chengjiang County in Yunnan Province is adopting a method that combines mountainous and dam areas, and the Jihua Agricultural Cooperative has benefited greatly from using this method.

    The Jihua Cooperative, with 813 member households, is located in a dam area. It has 4,572 mu of land, with an average of only 1.3 mu of cultivated land per person and 2.8 mu per laborer. How can this little land keep people busy for hundreds of days? Moreover, it is not enough for an agricultural cooperative to only produce rice and broad beans; the members also want to eat some minor grains and have pocket money to buy daily necessities. How should these problems be solved?

    To the west of the Jihua Cooperative is a mountain village called "Xiaotuanpo." Together with the nearby villages of "Datoupo" and "Zaibai," it has a total of 54 households and 220 people, with an average of more than 7 mu of cultivated land per person and 12.5 mu per laborer. Because there is more land than people, and the barren mountains cannot retain rainwater, the planting is not timely, and generally only half of the paddy fields can be planted with rice; the remaining half has to be planted with dry valley, with a yield of only about 70 jin per mu. The dry land cannot be fully cultivated either, and often more than half of it is left barren. The planted land has low yields because of a lack of fertilizer or no fertilizer at all, poor care, and natural disasters.

    Before the autumn harvest of 1955, the director of the Jihua Cooperative went up the mountain to understand the situation. He entered the home of middle peasant Deng Chaoli and saw a family of five eating a pot of green vegetables, each taking a bite. When asked why they weren't cooking rice, Deng Chaoli sighed and said they had no rice; there was also no quilt on the bed.

    It was clear that as long as the mountainous and dam areas were organized into one cooperative, both the labor potential of the dam area and the land potential of the mountainous area could be realized. He suggested that the two cooperatives merge. Because this suggestion met the needs of the masses, the two places smoothly merged into one cooperative. Many people in the mountainous area who had originally wanted to move down the mountain also stopped.

    This merger brought broad prospects for the development of the agricultural cooperative. First, they turned winter idleness into winter busy-ness, reclaiming more than 930 mu of wasteland on the mountain in one winter. In 1956, they planted more than 1,800 mu of flue-cured tobacco on the mountain. Although they suffered a severe drought, thanks to the large number of people who carried water to fight the drought, they still harvested more than 60 jin per mu. Also, because the production seasons in the mountainous and dam areas were different, the mountainous and dam areas were able to help each other with timely planting and harvesting. As a result, the total grain output also increased by 8%. In addition, the area planted with flue-cured tobacco in the dam area was also slightly expanded, and collective sideline occupations were also developed. Last year, the total output value of this cooperative increased by 34.15% compared with 1955.

    However, putting the farmers in the two areas into one cooperative was not without problems. The people in the dam area were fine, but some members in the mountainous area worried that they would suffer losses in delivering public grain after the merger; some were also afraid that work points would not be calculated clearly, and that the people in the dam area would take advantage of them. By the time of the autumn harvest distribution, their unnecessary worries were completely dispelled. Because there was work to do in the mountains all year round, and because the mountainous area was taken care of during the distribution, they received slightly more rice than the people in the dam area. Before the land reform, the rich middle peasants in Jihua Township (dam area), including household sideline occupations, had an average net income of only 61.24 yuan per person per year. Now, the average annual income per person in this "poor mountainous area" (including household sideline occupations) has reached more than 80 yuan.

    During the clear and crisp autumn season, I visited this mountainous area. The flue-cured tobacco had already been baked, and the threshing ground was piled high with soybeans and buckwheat. On the mountain behind, people were everywhere rushing to harvest corn. When I asked them if it was good to have the mountainous and dam areas combined into one cooperative, they said without hesitation, "It's just good!" Then they cited a lot of examples, one after another: "In the past, when it rained, we had to wear raincoats on our heads when we had meetings in the house. Now, look, there are houses for storing grain, houses for livestock, houses for storing farm implements, and houses for people from the dam area who come to work." "Without the dam area, how would we have the strength to grow so much flue-cured tobacco—the income from flue-cured tobacco is great, but it costs a lot." "With the dam area together, everything is easy." "There are also pastures and chicken farms." "Also, in the past, we didn't pay attention to the people in the dam area, but now we greet each other on the road, and when we go down to the dam to see plays and movies, we invite each other to stay overnight."...

    Talking with the people in the dam area, they said: "The benefits of combining the dam area and the mountainous area are endless. If we didn't have the mountainous area to develop cash crops, how would we have so much pocket money! Without the mountainous area, where would we find minor grains!" "There is work to do in the mountainous area all year round, and when we are idle in the dam area, we can come to the mountain to work."

    The comrades of the County Party Committee commented on the significance of this matter from a higher perspective: in addition to enabling both the mountainous and dam areas to find a way out, this approach has three major benefits: first, the development of cash crops no longer competes with grain for land; second, the transformation of the mountainous area is faster; and third, the state doesn't have to spend a penny. There is only one thing to pay attention to, that is, to focus on income in the first year, and to develop economic forests, animal husbandry, etc. in combination with gradual annual development.

### 让山区坝区一齐繁荣

    让山区坝区一齐繁荣
    本报记者　章皆淳
    山区需要发展生产，不过发展山区生产得考虑各种不同的条件。
    云南澄江县采取的是山区坝区相结合的办法，吉花农业社采用了这个办法得到了很大好处。
    拥有八百一十三户社员的吉花社所在地是一个坝区。它有土地四千五百七十二亩，每人平均只有耕地一点三亩，每个劳动力平均负担二点八亩。这点土地哪里能够人干上几百天？而且一个农业社光生产大米和蚕豆也嫌不够，社员还要求有些小杂粮吃用，要求有零花钱来买日用品。——这些问题应该怎样解决呢？
    在吉花社的西面，有一个名叫“小团坡”的山村。它和近旁的“大坡头”、“宰摆”两个小村一道，共有五十四户、二百二十人，每人平均有耕地七亩多，每个劳动力平均负担十二亩半。由于地多人少，加上荒山又蓄不住雨水，抢种不及，水田一般都只能栽上一半水稻，其余一半就只好种旱谷，每亩仅能收到七十多斤。旱地也种不完，经常都有一半多是荒着。种下去的，因为缺少肥料或根本不施肥料，照顾不周和自然灾害等等关系，产量很低。
    1955年秋收前，吉花社社长上山去了解情况，他走进中农邓朝李的家，只见这一家五口围着一盆青菜你一口我一口地吃，问怎么不煮饭，邓朝李叹了口气，原来是没有米；床上也没有被子。
    事情很明显，只要把山区和坝区组织在一个社里，坝区的劳动潜力和山区的土地潜力就都能得到发挥。他就建议两个社合起来，因为这一建议符合群众的要求，两个地方顺利地并成了一个社。山区有许多人本想搬下山的也不搬了。
    这一合并，给农业社带来了宽广的发展前途。首先，他们把冬闲变成了冬忙，一个冬天，就在山上开了九百三十多亩荒地。1956年，在山上种了一千八百多亩烤烟。虽然遭到严重的旱灾，因为人多，挑水抗旱的结果，每亩还是收到六十多斤。又因为山区和坝区的生产季节迟早不同，山区和坝区能够互相帮助，抢种抢收，因此，粮食总产量也增产了8％。再加上坝区的烤烟面积也稍有扩大，集体副业也有了发展，去年这个社的总产值竟比1955年增加了34．15％。
    不过，把两个地方的农民组织在一个社里，也不是没有一点问题。坝区的人倒没什么，山区社员中有些人担心，合并后交公粮上会吃亏；有些人还怕工分算不清，怕坝区的人占了他们的便宜。到秋收分配的时候，他们这种多余的担心完全解开了。因为山上一年到头都有活干，分配时因为照顾山区，他们分的大米还比坝区的人稍多一些。在土地改革前，吉花乡（坝区）的富裕中农，连家庭副业在内，平均每人每年纯收入才六十一点二四元，现在这“穷山区”的人们，每人一年的平均收入（包括家庭副业在内）竟达到八十多元。
    在秋高气爽的季节里，我访问了这个山区。烤烟已经烘烤完毕，场里是一大堆一大堆的黄豆和荞麦，在背后那只山上，到处是抢收包谷的人们。当我问起山区坝区合在一个社里好不好的时候，他们毫不思索地说：“就是好呀！”接着就你一言我一语的举出一大堆实例来：“过去下雨天坐在房子里开会还要用蓑衣披头，现在你瞧瞧，粮食有堆粮食的房，牲口有关牲口的房，农具有放农具的房，还有给来工作的坝区的人住的房。”“没有坝区，我们那有力量种这么多烤烟——烤烟收入是大，可是挺费本的”。“有坝区一道，什么都好办。”“还有牧场、养鸡场。”“还有，过去碰到坝区的人谁也不搭理，现在路头路尾碰到都是有说有笑的，下坝看戏看电影还招呼我们住宿。”……
    和坝区的人谈起来，他们说：“坝区山区相结合对坝区的好处说不完，要是没有山区来发展经济作物，我们那有这么多的零花钱！没有山区，我们那里找小杂粮去！”“山区一年到头都有活计，我们坝子里活计闲时又可到山上来干。”
    县委会的同志却又从更高的角度来评论这件事的意义：除了使山区坝区都找到出路以外，这样做，还有三大好处：一、发展经济作物不再和粮食争地皮；二、改造山区的速度快；三、还用不着国家花一文钱。只是有一条要注意，就是第一年就要抓收入，发展经济林木、畜牧等只能结合着逐年逐年的搞。
