Stories of Lenin
By our correspondent Li He

Editor's note: What is collected here are only scattered stories of Lenin in the period after the October Revolution. These stories come from the memories of people close to Lenin, and few people know about them. From these moving deeds, one can understand Lenin's style.

When the guns of the Aurora cruiser announced the beginning of a new era in human history, Lenin calmly stepped onto the podium of the Smolny Palace. He began to speak in a calm, matter-of-fact tone. He spoke of the upcoming Soviet Congress, the only body capable of realizing the revolutionary program of Russian workers, soldiers, and peasants. His words aroused endless applause in the hall crowded with revolutionary soldiers and workers. People who often listened to Lenin's speeches said: Lenin always paid attention to enlightening people's minds, and the audience was always moved in both thought and emotion.

Lenin always arranged his time tightly and accurately. He started working at the People's Committee at 9:00 every morning, and he was used to arriving a quarter of an hour early. In the morning, he read newspapers and letters from all over the country and abroad. He received many delegations and individual workers, peasants, actors, and people from all walks of life every day. He convened meetings of the People's Committee at 6:00 pm sharp every day.

Diligence had become a way of life for Lenin. In February 1921, Lenin received seventy people, attended forty meetings, and gave a large number of speeches and other heavy leadership work in twenty-three days. During these days, Lenin calculated almost every day with a pencil, how many poods of grain and coal had been found and transported to Moscow and other industrial cities. He convened meetings almost every day to find ways to overcome difficulties such as food and fuel.

Lenin liked to meet people and discuss matters with the masses, but he did not engage in aimless conversations. A sign hung on his door. It read: "Please note to visitors that the person you are about to meet is very busy, so please make your affairs brief and clear." Once, people were sitting outside the door waiting to be received. Half an hour, an hour, an hour and a half passed. Who had he been talking to for so long? The person came out. It was a poor peasant in a short coat and bark shoes. Lenin apologized to the waiting people: "This is a farmer from Tambov. I discussed the issue of electrification and the New Economic Policy with him. I wanted to know his opinion."

It can be said that it was Lenin's characteristic to solve the difficulties of the masses at any time with keen eyes. Once, workers at the Putilov factory wanted to set up a children's art studio in the factory school, which required rooms and musical instruments such as pianos and violins. They asked the District Soviet Executive Committee for help, and the answer they received was: "Your idea is commendable. But now is a difficult time, there is no fuel, no food, and you want to set up an art studio. Wait a year." The workers went to Lenin. Lenin said to the comrades around him: "Listen to what the Putilov factory workers want. They want to cultivate their own working-class intellectuals, but someone says to wait a year. No waiting, the art studio must be organized." He immediately called the Ministry of Education and said: "The workers of the Putilov factory are coming to see you, please give them everything they need."

Lenin was good at persuading and educating cadres and the masses. Once, he said to Antselovich, a member of the Petrograd Military Revolutionary Committee: "Do you know Yelizarov? Do you think he is competent to be the People's Commissar for Railways?" Antselovich knew that Yelizarov was a good Bolshevik with transportation knowledge and believed that he was competent. Lenin said: "I also think he is competent. He himself doesn't want to be the People's Commissar. And I am not comfortable persuading him. He is my brother-in-law, a relative. Please persuade him." Antselovich took a group of railway staff with him. They persuaded Yelizarov to work at the People's Commissariat of Railways. He was the first People's Commissar for Railways. Another time, a group of workers asked Lenin to let them leave a People's Commissariat and return to work in the factory, believing that "they could do more for the revolution in the factory." Lenin said to them: "I have never managed the country before, but the party and the people have entrusted me with this job, so I should live up to the trust of the people. I suggest you do the same." Yet another time, a workers' delegation visited Lenin and requested that the factory where they were located be nationalized. Lenin picked up a form and said: "Yes. This is very simple. Since it concerns me, I only need to cross out your factory name on this form, then sign here and write the surname of the People's Commissar there." The delegates were very satisfied and waited for Lenin to do what he said immediately. But Lenin continued: "Before signing this form, I would like to ask you a few questions. First, do you know how to ensure that the factory has raw materials and fuel?" The delegates admitted that they were not good at this. Lenin then said: "Secondly, can you make reports? Have you formulated a plan to increase production? Finally, comrades, allow me to ask you, have you found a market to sell your products?" The delegates were silent. Lenin continued: "So, don't you think you are not ready to take the factory into your own hands? Please go back to the factory and discuss these issues carefully. Study hard for a while, and come back in a few months, and then your factory will be nationalized."

A simple life is a forever admired example left by Lenin. Once, a worker was about to go to the front line and wanted to get help for his family. He went to Lenin. He walked into Lenin's office, touched the small writing desk, looked at the faded floor and half-timbered wall panels, and looked at Lenin's clothes and shoes, and said with emotion: "Vladimir Ilyich, I came to you for help. And you live like us. ... Forgive me for disturbing you with trivial matters, I don't need anything." Lenin said: "No, these are not trivial matters. But, you know how difficult a period we are going through. That's very good." The worker came out and said to others: "He received me like a brother. I asked not to be given help. He lives the simplest life." In Petrograd, Lenin ate in the public canteen of the People's Committee, eating sauerkraut soup, salted herring, buckwheat porridge, and one hundred and fifty grams of bread. In Moscow, a female worker, Sisyoyeva, helped Lenin with housework. She recalled: "Lenin treated me like a member of the family. I always acted like a housewife. He never told me what to cook, I cooked what I knew how to cook. Sometimes the food was better, and Lenin kept saying, why bother? Don't do that, it should be simpler. "She saw that Lenin's shirt was soaked in sweat when he came back from the "voluntary Saturday" labor, and his shoes were cracked.

    列宁的故事
    本报记者　李何
    编者按　这里所搜集的只是列宁在十月革命后一段时期内的零星故事。这些故事出自接近列宁的人们的回忆，知道者还少。从这些令人感动的事迹中可以领会到列宁的作风。
    当阿芙乐尔巡洋舰的炮声宣告人类历史新纪元的开端的时候，列宁安详地走上斯莫尔尼宫的讲坛。他用平静的、就事论事的语气开始讲话。他讲到将要来临的苏维埃代表大会，是能够实现俄国工人、士兵和农民的革命纲领的唯一机构。他的话在挤满革命的士兵和工人的大厅内引起了不息的掌声。常听列宁讲话的人说：列宁向来注意启发人们的思想，而听众总是思想连感情都被打动了。
    列宁一向把时间安排得紧张而准确。他每天上午九点钟在人民委员会开始办公，习惯早一刻钟到。他上午读报，读全国各地和国外来信。他每天接见许多代表团和个别工人、农民、演员、各行各业人员。他每天下午六点钟准时召集人民委员会的会议。
    勤劳在列宁已经成为生活习惯。在1921年2月，列宁在二十三天内接见了七十个人，参加了四十次会议，还有大批的演讲和其他繁重的领导工作。在这些日子里，列宁差不多天天拿着铅笔计算，找到了多少普特粮食和煤并运到莫斯科以及别的工业城市了。他差不多每天召集会议，寻找克服粮食和燃料等等困难的办法。
    列宁喜欢接见人们，和群众商量事情，但他不作漫无边际的谈话。在他的门口挂着一个牌子。上面写着：“请来访者注意，你们所要会见的人很忙，所以请把各人的事情说得简短明确”。有一次，人们坐在门外等待接见。半点钟、一点钟、一点半钟过去了。和谁谈这么久呢？这个人出来了。是一个穿着短袄和树皮鞋的贫农。列宁请等候的人们原谅说：“这是从唐波夫来的农民。我和他商量有关电气化和新经济政策问题。我曾经想知道他的意见”。
    以锐利的眼光随时替群众解决疑难事，可以说是列宁的特色。有一次，普梯洛夫工厂工人要在工厂学校内设立儿童艺术活动室，这需要房间和钢琴、提琴等等乐器。他们向区苏维埃执行委员会请求帮助，得到的回答是：“你们的念头可嘉。但现在是困难时候，没有燃料，没有粮食，而你们要设立艺术活动室。等一年再说。”工人们找了列宁。列宁向周围的同志们说：“你们听，普梯洛夫工厂工人要的是什么。他们要培养自己的劳动的知识分子，而有人却说要等一年。不要什么等待，必须组织艺术活动室。”他立即打电话给国民教育部说：“普梯洛夫工厂工人要来找你们，请给他们所需要的一切。”
    列宁善于说服和教育干部和群众。有一次，他对彼得堡军事革命委员会委员安采洛维奇说：“您认识叶利查罗夫吗？您觉得他当铁道人民委员能胜任吗？”安采洛维奇知道叶利查罗夫是一个具有交通知识的好布尔什维克，认为可以胜任。列宁说：“我也认为他可以胜任。他自己不想当人民委员。而我也不便劝他。他是我的妹夫，亲人。请您说服他吧。”安采洛维奇带一批铁道工作人员去了。他们说服了叶利查罗夫到铁道人民委员会工作。他是第一任铁道人民委员。又有一次，一群工人请求列宁让他们离开一个人民委员部，回工厂工作，认为“在工厂对革命可以作出更多事情”。列宁对他们说：“我也是从来没有管理过国家的，可是党和人民委托我做这个工作，所以我应当不负人民的信托。建议你们也这样做。”再有一次，一个工人代表团访见列宁，请求把他们所在的那座工厂收归国有。列宁拿起一张表格说：“是。这事很简单。既然事情和我有关，我只要在这个表上把你们的厂名画掉，然后在这儿签名，在那儿写下人民委员的姓。”代表们很满意，等着列宁立刻把所说的事情办妥。可是列宁继续说：“在签这张表格以前，我想问你们几件事。第一，你们知道怎样保证工厂有原料和燃料吗？”代表们承认此事不在行。列宁又说：“其次，你们会作表报吗？制订了提高生产的计划没有？最后，同志们，允许我问你们，找到了销售你们的产品的市场没有？”代表们沉默了。列宁继续说：“所以，你们不觉得你们还没有准备好把工厂拿到自己的手里吗？请回工厂去好好商量这些问题。暂且学习学习，过几个月再来，那时会把你们那座工厂国有化。”
    朴素的生活是列宁留下的一个永远令人思慕的榜样。有一次，一个工人要上前线了，想为他的家属取得帮助。他找了列宁。他走进列宁的办公室，用手摸摸小写字桌，瞧瞧已经褪色的地板和半截木材壁板，看看列宁的服装和鞋子，感动地说：“弗拉基米尔·伊里奇，我到您这儿来求帮助。而您像我们一样生活。……原谅我把生活琐事吵扰您，我什么也不需要。”列宁说：“不，这不是琐事。可是，您自己晓得我们在度多么困难的时期。这样很好。”工人出来对别的人说：“他像亲兄弟似的接见我。我请求不要给我帮助。他过的是最最朴素的生活。”在彼得堡时，列宁是在人民委员会的公共食堂吃饭的，吃的是酸菜汤、咸青鱼、荞麦稀粥和一百五十公分面包。在莫斯科时，有一个女工西索也娃帮助列宁料理家务。她回忆说：“列宁对我像对待家庭的成员。我向来像主妇一样。他从来也没有吩咐我做什么饭菜，我做了自己会做的饭菜。有时饭菜做得好些，列宁不停地说，何必？不要这样，应该简单些。她看到列宁参加“义务星期六”劳动回来时汗水湿透了衬衣，鞋也裂开口了。
