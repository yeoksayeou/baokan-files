Xinhua News Agency, 24th dispatch: The central electromechanical manufacturing industry departments are actively taking measures to ensure the completion of the task of manufacturing complete sets of chemical fertilizer equipment.

During the Second Five-Year Plan period, China's chemical fertilizer industry will be greatly developed. The state has decided that the complete set of equipment needed for the development of the chemical fertilizer industry will be supplied entirely by China itself; and it has been decided that the First Ministry of Machine Building, the Second Ministry of Machine Building, and the Ministry of Electrical Machinery Manufacturing will cooperate to manufacture it. These three industrial ministries have arranged for their related factories to undertake the manufacture according to the main equipment items, quantities, and delivery dates required by the Ministry of Chemical Industry for the development of the chemical fertilizer industry during the Second Five-Year Plan, and have signed agreements and contracts with the Ministry of Chemical Industry. At present, the departments concerned are actively carrying out production preparation work.

According to the situation reported and checked by the State Technology Commission recently, a batch of key equipment for chemical fertilizers included in next year's plan, such as high-pressure reaction cylinders, large high-pressure air compressors, oxygen production equipment, turbine blowers, and large 3,800 kW electric motors, can be manufactured and supplied domestically. Only a few new automatic control instruments still need to be imported from abroad. However, the State Technology Commission pointed out that none of these main equipment for chemical fertilizers has been manufactured domestically, and many of the large-scale equipment require very high technical conditions and complex manufacturing technology. Therefore, it is necessary to concentrate a great deal of technical strength to overcome the difficulties in design and manufacturing.

In order to ensure the completion of the manufacturing tasks for 1958, the State Technology Commission has discussed with the First Ministry of Machine Building, the Second Ministry of Machine Building, the Ministry of Electrical Machinery Manufacturing, and the Ministry of Chemical Industry and decided to take the following measures:
	(1) The four ministries—First Ministry, Second Ministry, Ministry of Electrical Machinery, and Ministry of Chemical Industry—will each designate a vice minister to jointly organize a leading group, hold regular meetings, check progress, and solve coordination and cooperation problems. (2) The First Ministry, Second Ministry, Ministry of Electrical Machinery, and Ministry of Chemical Industry will each designate senior technicians to form a technical group to provide technical guidance to design units and manufacturing factories, and concentrate efforts to study and solve major technical problems in design and manufacturing. (3) Establish a special responsibility system. All relevant production, technical, and supply departments should designate specific personnel to be responsible, report regularly, reflect problems in a timely manner, and solve them quickly. Regarding the metal materials required for manufacturing equipment, the relevant departments hope that the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry can trial-produce them as soon as possible.

    中央机电制造工业部门订出三项具体措施
    保证成套供应制造化学肥料的设备
    据新华社24日讯　中央机械制造工业部门积极采取措施，保证完成成套制造化学肥料设备的任务。
    在第二个五年计划期间，我国的化学肥料工业将要大大发展。国家已经决定发展化学肥料工业所需的全套设备，全部由我国自己供应；并且决定由第一机械工业部、第二机械工业部和电机制造工业部共同协作制造。这三个工业部已经按照化学工业部提出的第二个五年计划发展化学肥料工业所需的主要设备项目、数量和交货日期，布置所属的有关工厂承制，并和化工部签订了协议、合同。目前，各有关部门正在积极进行生产准备工作。
    根据国家技术委员会最近召集各部汇报检查的情况，列入明年计划的一批化学肥料的主要关键设备如高压反应筒、大型高压空气压缩机、制氧设备、透平鼓风机以及三千八百瓩的大型电动机等等，都可以由国内制造供应。只有少数新式自动控制的仪表尚须由国外进口。但是国家技术委员会指出：这些化学肥料的主要设备，国内都没有制造过，其中很多大型设备，要求的技术条件很高，制造技术很复杂，因此，必须集中很大的技术力量，克服设计和制造中的困难。
    为了保证完成1958年的制造任务，国家技术委员会已经同第一机械工业部、第二机械工业部、电机制造工业部和化学工业部商讨，决定采取以下措施：
      （一）由一部、二部、电机部、化工部四个部分别指定一位副部长共同组织一个领导小组，定期举行会议，检查进度，解决协作及配合问题。（二）由一部、二部、电机部和化工部分别指定高级技术人员组成技术小组，对设计单位和制造工厂进行技术指导，集中力量研究和解决设计和制造上的重大技术问题。（三）建立专责制度，各有关生产、技术、供应部门都应指定专人负责，定期汇报，及时反映问题，迅速解决。关于制造设备所需的金属材料，有关部门希望冶金工业部能够早日试制。
