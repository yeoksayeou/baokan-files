Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, November 26th. The Egyptian National Assembly, in its meeting on the evening of November 25th, unanimously passed a resolution thanking the Soviet Union for its economic assistance to Egypt after hearing a report from Defense Minister General Amer regarding his recent visit to the Soviet Union. The resolution also expressed support for the government's policies.

When General Amer entered the packed assembly hall, members of parliament stood up and cheered him for about two minutes. Most cabinet ministers attended the meeting. The press gallery was full.

General Amer, in discussing the meetings between the Egyptian delegation and Soviet leaders, said, "In discussing all our issues, we felt a genuine hope and a heartfelt welcome."

General Amer said that he discovered "a real understanding on the Soviet side. The Soviet Union respects our independence and does not intend to interfere in our internal affairs. It values our desire to maintain the unity of the Arab people. It does not intend to sow discord among us, but welcomes our efforts to contribute to peace by adopting a policy of positive neutralism."

General Amer said that he told the Soviet leaders that Egypt adheres to the principle of positive neutrality, that it does not want to play any role in the Cold War, but desires genuine peace and strives to develop the country's resources. Egypt is unwilling to turn its country into a base for atomic and hydrogen bombs to be used to attack the people of another country.

He said that in addition to explaining Egypt's attitude in the international arena, he also said that Egypt wants to maintain its independence. Like its attitude towards the Arab world, Egypt has unlimited trust in Arab nationalism. "Arab nationalism does not seek to establish an Arab empire, but is an emotional call, a collective weapon of people with common aspirations who want to find their rightful place in the world."

General Amer said that Egypt had asked the Soviet Union to cooperate with Egypt to assist in the five-year industrialization plan implemented by Egypt despite the economic blockade. He said that he "found that the Soviet side genuinely and truly wanted to cooperate with us." Amer also said, "We are seeking a guarantee to help us continue to implement a policy of maintaining peace. We see no harm in seeking the cooperation of all countries that believe in peace and freedom."

General Amer finally told the members of parliament that he, on behalf of the Egyptian people and government, warmly thanked the Soviet people and government for their support of Egypt during the tripartite aggression against Egypt by Britain, France, and Israel, and for their attitude towards the Syrian crisis.

General Amer's report was repeatedly interrupted by applause. After his report, many members of parliament spoke in support of the results of Amer's talks with the Soviet Union, expressing gratitude to the Soviet Union, and excitedly believing that Soviet economic assistance would strengthen Egypt's economy.

    埃及国民议会通过决议
    感谢苏联的经济援助
    阿密尔将军称道苏联尊重埃及独立
    新华社开罗26日电　埃及国民议会11月25日晚上的会议，在听取了国防部长阿密尔将军关于他最近访问苏联的报告以后，全体一致通过决议，感谢苏联给予埃及经济援助。决议也表示支持政府的政策。
    当阿密尔将军走进挤得满满的议会大厅时，议员们起立欢呼向他致意约两分钟之久。大部分内阁部长都出席了这次会议。记者席上座无虚席。
    阿密尔将军在谈到埃及代表团和苏联领导人的会谈时说，“在讨论我们的一切问题时，我们感到一种真诚的希望和一种由衷的欢迎。”
    阿密尔将军说，他发现了“苏联方面的真正谅解。苏联尊重我们的独立，并不打算干预我们的内政。它重视我们要维护阿拉伯人民团结的愿望。它并不打算在我们中间散布不和，而是欢迎我们通过采取积极的中立主义态度而对和平作出贡献的努力。”
    阿密尔将军说，他曾经对苏联的领导人说，埃及恪守积极中立的原则，它不希望在冷战中起任何作用，而希望真正的和平，并且努力开发国家的资源。埃及不愿意把自己国家变成被用来进攻一个国家的人民的原子弹和氢弹的基地。
    他说，他除去解释了埃及在国际领域中的态度以外，还说，埃及要维护它的独立。就像对阿拉伯世界的态度一样，埃及对于阿拉伯民族主义具有无限的信赖。“阿拉伯民族主义不是想建立一个阿拉伯帝国，而是一种情感的召唤，是一些具有共同抱负、想在世界上找到自己应有地位的人们的集体武器”。
    阿密尔将军说，埃及曾经要求苏联同埃及合作，协助埃及不顾经济封锁而实行的五年工业化计划。他说，他“发现，苏联方面真正确实希望同我们合作”。阿密尔又说，“我们在寻求一种保证，来帮助我们继续实行维护和平的政策。我们看不出设法取得一切相信和平和自由的国家的合作有什么害处。”
    阿密尔将军最后对议员们说，他代表埃及人民和政府热烈感谢苏联人民和政府在英、法、以色列三国侵略埃及期间对埃及的支持和他们对叙利亚危机的态度。
    阿密尔将军的报告一再为掌声所打断。在他报告完毕后，很多议员发言支持阿密尔这次和苏联会谈的结果，表示感谢苏联，并且兴奋地认为，苏联的经济援助将会加强埃及的经济。
