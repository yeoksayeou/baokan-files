Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 29th—The Tibet Working Committee of the Communist Party of China held an enlarged meeting from November 19th to 27th. More than 100 leading Party cadres from various regions and departments in Tibet attended and were present at the meeting.

Zhang Jingwu, Secretary of the Tibet Working Committee of the CPC, conveyed the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the CPC at the meeting. Zhang Guohua, Deputy Secretary of the Tibet Working Committee of the CPC, made a report on the work arrangements for this winter and next spring on behalf of the Working Committee.

The meeting discussed the above two reports based on the actual situation in Tibet.

The meeting unanimously agreed that it is very necessary to carry out a rectification movement within Party organizations at all levels in Tibet. In addition to vigorously overcoming bureaucracy, subjectivism, and sectarianism during the rectification, education to oppose Han chauvinism and local nationalism must also be conducted. No rectification will be carried out among all classes of Tibetan people; only socialist and patriotic education will be conducted.

The meeting unanimously agreed that the main task in Tibet in the future is to continue to expand the anti-imperialist and patriotic united front, strive to unite and cooperate with more patriotic and progressive Tibetans, and continue to cultivate revolutionary Tibetan cadres who serve the people.

There are unreasonable phenomena in the salaries of staff in Tibet, which are generally too high. The meeting decided to make appropriate adjustments.

The meeting encouraged all staff members and officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army in Tibet to continue to carry forward the fine traditions of hard work and simplicity since entering Tibet, closely connect with the broad masses of the Tibetan people, share weal and woe with the masses, unite closely, establish correct long-term ideas for building Tibet, and strive to build a new Tibet for the motherland.

    反对大民族主义和地方民族主义
    西藏地区各级党组织将开始整风
    在藏族各阶层人士中只进行社会主义和爱国主义教育
    新华社拉萨29日电　中国共产党西藏工作委员会在11月19日到27日举行了扩大会议，出席和列席会议的有西藏各地区、各部门的党员负责干部一百多人。
    中共西藏工委书记张经武在会议上传达了中共八届三中全会的精神。中共西藏工委副书记张国华代表工委作了关于今冬明春工作安排的报告。
    会议根据西藏地区的实际情况对以上两个报告进行了讨论。
    会议一致认为，在西藏地区各级党组织内开展整风运动是十分必要的，整风中除了大力克服官僚主义、主观主义、宗派主义外，还必须进行反对大民族主义和地方民族主义的教育；在藏族各阶层人士中不整风，只进行社会主义和爱国主义教育。
    会议一致认为，今后西藏地区的主要工作是继续扩大反帝爱国统一战线，争取和更多的藏族爱国进步人士团结合作，并继续培养为人民服务的革命藏族干部。
    目前西藏地区工作人员的工资有不合理现象，一般都偏高，会议确定适当地进行调整。
    会议勉励在西藏的全体工作人员和中国人民解放军官兵继续发扬进藏以来艰苦朴素的优良作风，密切联系西藏的广大群众，和群众共甘苦，亲密团结，树立正确的长期建藏思想，努力建设祖国的新西藏。
