Four "Reasons"

	Zhu Ke, Deputy Director of the Shanghai Second Commercial Bureau, is not confident in the bureau's rectification work. He put forward four reasons: First, there is no strength to research; second, even if research is done, there may not be a solution; third, even if there is a solution, it may not be unanimously approved by the bureau's leaders; fourth, even if it is approved, there is no strength to implement it.

	Four reasons, in orderly sequence, seem to indicate that the work of the Commercial Bureau has become a fixed situation. Is this how it is in practice, as it is in words?

    四条“理由”
    上海市第二商业局副局长祝珂同志对本局的整改工作信心不高，他提出四条理由：第一，没有力量研究；第二，研究了也不一定有解决的办法；第三，有了解决办法也不一定在局的领导人中一致通过；第四，即使通过了也没有力量贯彻执行。
    理由四条，次序井然，似乎商业局的工作已成一个铁定的局面。口头上如此，不知实际工作是不是如此？
