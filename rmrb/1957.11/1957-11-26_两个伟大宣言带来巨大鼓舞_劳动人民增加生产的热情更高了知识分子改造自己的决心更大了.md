Xinhua News Agency, November 25th: The "Declaration of the Meeting of Representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of Socialist Countries" and the "Peace Manifesto" issued by the Meeting of Representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties have received increasingly widespread and enthusiastic responses among the laboring people of our country.

Some representatives attending the Second Session of the Second Congress of the Communist Party of China in Shaanxi Province held a forum on the 24th to discuss the two declarations. Xu Jingzhang, a delegate to the Congress and Director of the Douma Agricultural Cooperative in Xingping County, attended the World People's Peace Conference in Vienna in 1952. He said that in the one or two years after returning from Vienna, he conveyed the spirit of the World People's Peace Conference to more than fifty mass meetings, with more than 100,000 listeners. He expressed that he would make promoting world peace a regular part of his work in the future. Liu Shuxian, a delegate to the Congress and Director of the Heping Agricultural Cooperative in Weinan County, said that he would work hard to increase the production of grain and cotton to support national construction and strengthen the forces defending peace. The agricultural cooperative he is in sold 40,000 jin more of ginned cotton to the state this year than last year, and it is estimated that it can sell 30,000 jin more ginned cotton to the state next year than this year. Old workers, engineers, and technicians from the Xi'an Agricultural Machinery Factory and the Xi'an Mining Machinery Repair Factory also held forums separately. Wang Fenghua, leader of the welding group at the Xi'an Mining Machinery Repair Factory, said at the meeting that he would strive to overfulfill the state plan, strengthen unity with the laboring people of other countries, and defend world peace.

Gao Daocheng, Wang Dacheng, Li Bin, Liu Desheng, Zhou Xiong, and Wang Shirong, representatives from Hubei Province attending the Eighth National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions in Wuhan, wrote to the Hubei Daily saying: "We fully support these two declarations because they represent the common will of our laboring people. Striving for lasting world peace and promoting the cause of human progress have been, are, and will continue to be the goals of our working class. The two declarations have increased our confidence and strength in building a peaceful and happy life a hundredfold." After reading the two declarations, Hubei Provincial agricultural labor models Rao Xingli, Guan Musheng, Wang Dafu, and Xin Zhiying all said that they would further improve agricultural production and use practical actions to organize a great leap forward in agricultural production to strengthen the forces of peace and defend world peace.

Zhang Chunren, an old worker at the tool workshop of the Changchun No. 1 Automobile Manufacturing Plant, said that it was a historically significant event that representatives of the Communist Parties and Workers' Parties of all countries gathered together to discuss international affairs. Chairman Mao signed the two declarations on our behalf, which meant he spoke for us, and we will definitely act in accordance with the requirements of the declarations.

The more than two thousand official delegates and observers attending the Second Session of the First Congress of the Communist Party of China in Shanxi Province have been seriously studying the two declarations these days. Lian Wanlu, of Datong Coal Mine, who has continuously created new national coal mine tunneling records, said that the two declarations have further strengthened our confidence and strength in peaceful construction. During the rectification movement, our Datong Coal Mine created the highest record of daily output since liberation. I am an old miner of more than thirty years, and our coal miners can fully demonstrate our support for the two major declarations with even more outstanding production achievements.

In Shenyang City, the workers of the Second Section and Second Group of the Machine Assembly Workshop of the Pneumatic Tool Factory, which had completed the November production task eight days ahead of schedule, excitedly gathered together during their rest period to discuss the two declarations. All the workers in the group unanimously stated: By the end of the month, they will produce another one thousand small parts for rock drills for the country. Shi Zhengzhi, a young worker working on the construction site of the Lanzhou Refinery who had begged for food when the Japanese imperialists occupied Northeast China, said: Our current prosperous and well-fed life did not come easily, and we must never let imperialism provoke a war to destroy our happy life. They unanimously agreed to overfulfill the November production plan by 100% on the basis of completing it ahead of schedule, adding more strength to the fight against imperialist war conspiracies.

Workers and peasants in Chengdu, Hangzhou, Changsha, Hefei, Fuzhou, and other places also unanimously supported the two declarations.

Xinhua News Agency, November 25th: The vast number of revolutionary intellectuals in our country warmly support the "Declaration of the Meeting of Representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of Socialist Countries" and the "Peace Manifesto" issued by the Meeting of Representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties.

In the capital, teachers at Peking University held a forum on the 25th. Professors in their speeches believed that the two great declarations marked a new stage in the world communist movement and peace movement, greatly strengthening the confidence of the people of all countries in striving for peace, democracy, and socialism. Professor Zheng Xin, head of the Philosophy Department, said: "The two declarations have given us profound education, especially telling us intellectuals that we should abandon all illusions, properly remold our thinking, and more firmly take the socialist road.

Professors and students at Tsinghua University have held forums one after another in recent days. Li Jixiang, a professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Tsinghua University, said: The declaration profoundly points out the roots of revisionism, which is very important for us intellectuals. We must consciously carry out ideological remolding and become intellectuals of the working class.

The vast number of revolutionary intellectuals in Anhui Province were very excited after seeing the declaration. Qi Jianru, a professor at Anhui Agricultural College, said: "From the declaration, we can see more clearly that the prosperity and strength of the new world are like the rising sun, and the decline and fall of the old world are like the setting sun."

The staff of the Medical and Epidemic Prevention Section of the Hangzhou Municipal Health Bureau said in the discussion that the declaration's statement of creating a strong contingent of intellectuals loyal to the working class, the laboring people, and the socialist cause has further encouraged our intellectuals to thoroughly remold their determination.

Revolutionary intellectuals in Shenyang, Xi'an, Fuzhou, Taiyuan, Hohhot, and Chengdu also expressed their warm support for the two declarations.
