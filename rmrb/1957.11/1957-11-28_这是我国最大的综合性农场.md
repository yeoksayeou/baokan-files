    This is China's Largest Comprehensive Farm
    The state-owned Dongxihu Farm, located in the northwestern suburbs of Wuhan, is China's first and largest comprehensive farm serving the city. This area was originally a vast wasteland, covering an area of about 450 square kilometers. The land is fertile, but the terrain is low-lying and surrounded by water on three sides. Every flood season or rainy season, rainwater gathers, forming a vast expanse of water. After the flood season, weeds grow luxuriantly. Based on this situation, the construction project of Dongxihu Farm includes two aspects: flood control and drainage, and land reclamation and farm construction. Starting from Zhanggong Embankment in Hankou, passing through the Shortcut River, turning to Huangpi, and extending to X溝 in Hanyang, a large embankment, 120 li long, one zhang to more than two zhang high, and more than one zhang wide on top, must first be built to connect with the Han River trunk embankment and Zhanggong Embankment to form a large enclosure of more than 200 li long to block floods. To prevent too much rain or too long a drought, a vaulted concrete drainage sluice should be built near the Shortcut River, and an intake sluice should be built near the Han River. In the southern part of the reclaimed area, near the vegetable farm, a high-water lake several meters higher than the low-lying ground will be built according to the terrain; the low-water lake in the eastern part of the reclaimed area will be transformed; and the middle-water lake in the central part of the reclaimed area will be enclosed. In addition, large-scale drainage and irrigation canals like spider webs, as well as machine pumping stations, etc., will also be built.
    Dongxihu Farm is a large farm with 260,000 mu of land and 140,000 mu of lakes. This farm will have a relatively high degree of mechanization in the future. Almost all of the hundreds of thousands of mu of land will be cultivated by machines. The dairy farm has powered slicers, soybean cake crushers, universal crushers, root washing machines, electric milking machines, etc. The vegetable farm will use advanced production methods such as greenhouses, hotbeds, and shade sheds. By 1962, Dongxihu Farm will be able to supply the city with 120,000 fat pigs, 25 million jin of milk, 30 million jin of fish, 79 million jin of vegetables, 8 million jin of cotton, and 30 million jin of grain annually; in addition, there will be meat foods such as cattle, chickens, and ducks. The construction of this farm also has a huge effect on eliminating schistosomiasis in this area.

    这是我国最大的综合性农场
    国营东西湖农场，是我国第一个最大的为城市服务的综合性农场，位于武汉市郊区的西北部。这里原是一块辽阔的荒地，面积约有四百五十平方公里，土地肥沃，但是，地势低洼，三面环水，每到汛期或雨季，雨水聚清，形成一片汪洋，汛期一过便野草丛生。根据这种情况，东西湖农场的建场工程包括防洪排渍和垦荒建场两个方面。从汉口张公堤起，沿捷径河经黄陂转孝感至汉阳新沟止，首先要修一条长达一百二十里、高一丈至两丈多、顶面宽一丈多的大围堤，以便与汉水干堤、张公堤连接，围成一个两百多里长的大围圈，阻挡洪水。为了防止雨水太多，或者干旱时间太长，在靠捷径河的地方，还要修一座拱形的混凝土排水闸；在靠汉水的地方，修一座进水闸。在垦区南部，靠蔬菜场的地方，将根据地形条件，修一座高出低洼地面数公尺的高水湖；改造垦区东部的低水湖；围建垦区中部的中水湖。此外，还要修建规模庞大的、像蜘蛛网一样的排灌渠道，以及机器抽水站等。
    东西湖农场是一个拥有二十六万亩土地、十四万亩湖泊的大型农场。这个农场将来的机械化程度较高，几十万亩土地几乎将全部采用机耕；奶牛场中有动力切片机、豆饼粉碎机、万能粉碎机、块根洗净机、电动挤奶器等；蔬菜场将利用温室、温床、阴棚等先进生产方法。到1962年，东西湖农场每年将可供应城市肥猪十二万头，牛奶二千五百万斤，鱼三千万斤，蔬菜七千九百万斤，棉花八百万斤，粮食三千万斤；另外还有牛、鸡、鸭等肉食品。这个农场的修建，对消灭这一带地区的血吸虫也有巨大作用。　　　　　　　　　（田庄）
