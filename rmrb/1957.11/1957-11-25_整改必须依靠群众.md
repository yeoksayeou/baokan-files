    Rectification Must Rely on the Masses
    Wu Erxiang
    The principle that the affairs of the masses must be handled by the masses themselves is a policy our Party has always followed. This is naturally no exception in the process of rectifying the cooperatives. In the Xixiang Second Cooperative of Xinhui County, Guangdong Province, members pointed out that the cooperative had too few pigsties, and the ground was not paved with bricks. On rainy days, the pigs all turned into mud pigs, so they requested that the pigsties be expanded and paved with bricks immediately. However, expansion and paving would cost at least 500 yuan, which the cooperative could not afford. What to do? The cooperative cadres let the masses discuss this issue. After the members understood the cooperative's difficulties, they proactively suggested laying sand first and expanding and paving with bricks after the autumn harvest when there was money. In Shajiao Township, Shunde County, during the blooming and contending period, the masses urgently requested the establishment of a primary school to solve the problem of children's schooling. The cadres said, "We'll talk about it later; it can't be done now." The masses said, "Then let's have a meeting later too!" and dispersed in a rush. The cadres were anxious and felt that this method of handling things by the cadres was not working. So, they changed their approach. They explained to the masses that there was no money now, so what should they do? The masses said, "It's easy to handle without money; we'll raise funds ourselves." They immediately raised 800 yuan. The primary school was established, solving the schooling problem for more than 80 children. The problem that the cadres originally thought was thorny and unsolvable was solved by the masses themselves.
    The experience of various places in Guangdong proves that improving work, running cooperatives well, and promoting production are the immediate concerns of the broad masses. These things must be done by the masses themselves, and only by relying on their own strength can these things be done well.

    整改必须依靠群众
    吴尔祥
    群众的事情要依靠群众自己来办，这是我们党一向遵循的方针。在整社过程中自然也不能例外。广东省新会县社西乡第二社，社员提出社里的猪栏太少，地上又没有铺砖，下雨天，猪都变成了泥猪，因此要求立即扩建猪栏和铺砖。但是扩建和铺砖至少得花五百元钱，社里拿不出这笔钱来。怎么办呢？社干部就把这个意见让群众来讨论，社员了解了社里的困难，主动提议目前先铺沙，等秋收后有钱了再扩建和铺砖。顺德县沙滘乡，在鸣放中，群众迫切要求办小学，解决孩子入学问题。干部说：“这以后再说，现在办不了。”群众说：“那也以后再开会吧！”一哄而散。干部着急了，觉得这样由干部包办的办法不行了。就改变了作法，他们向群众说明现在没有钱，怎么办呢？群众说：“没有钱好办，我们自己募捐。”一下子就募到了八百元。小学办起来了，解决了八十多个孩子入学的困难。干部原来认为棘手无法解决的问题，就这样由群众自己解决了。
    广东各地的经验证明，改进工作，办好合作社，搞好生产，是广大群众的切身事情，必须由群众自己来做，也只有依靠他们自己的力量，才能把这些事情做好。
