Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, November 25th: According to the Korean Central News Agency: The results of the field investigation conducted by the Second Joint Observer Group of the Korean Military Armistice Commission on the 23rd and 24th near the Military Demarcation Line marker number 212, completely confirmed the fact that the U.S. side dispatched special agents to cross the Military Demarcation Line for hostile activities.

The U.S. special agents Kim Hak-joon (original name: Lee Hak-soon) and Lee Seung-yeol, who crossed the Military Demarcation Line on November 20th and were arrested by the Korean-Chinese side's administrative police, confessed during the investigation that Kim Hak-joon was originally the captain of the "Nampo No. 18" fishing boat of the Nampo Aquatic Products Business Office in the northern part of the Republic. On April 27th of this year, while he and Lee Seung-yeol, Lee Chang-il, Shen Ren-hwan, and four others were fishing near Deokdo Island in the Nampo Sea, they were forcibly abducted to South Korea by the Lee Seung-man group's naval vessels and armed vessels disguised as fishing boats. Kim Hak-joon and Lee Seung-yeol were sent to the "Lion 33" unit of the Lee puppet army's special agent force in Incheon City and underwent five months of special agent training. On November 20th, Kim Hak-joon and Lee Seung-yeol received orders from the commander of the "Lion 33" unit and, under the guidance of the Lee puppet army, crossed the Military Demarcation Line, and lurked in the demilitarized zone of the Korean-Chinese side, engaging in activities to gather military intelligence. At 19:30 that day, Kim and Lee were captured by the Korean-Chinese side.

The Joint Observer Group also investigated the items carried by Kim Hak-joon and others. The words and trademarks on the shoes, clothing, and other items they carried indicated that these items were all made in the United States or South Korea. Kim Hak-joon and others confessed that they brought these items to bribe women and children.

Based on the facts proven during the investigation, the Korean-Chinese side suggested that members of both sides of the Joint Observer Group jointly submit a special report to the Military Armistice Commission. The U.S. side refused, disregarding the facts.

Regarding the incident of the "Nampo No. 18" fishing boat being abducted by the U.S. side in the territorial waters of the Republic's north, the Korean-Chinese side lodged a protest with the U.S. side at the Secretary General's meeting of the Military Armistice Commission on May 13th of this year, and demanded that the U.S. side immediately repatriate the aforementioned vessel and personnel on board. Six months later, on November 4th, the U.S. side denied that this incident had occurred at the Secretary General's meeting. However, the current situation shows that, in addition to Kim Hak-joon and Lee Seung-yeol, Lee Chang-il and Shen Ren-hwan, two of the seven crew members of this fishing boat, had also been sent to the "Lion 95" unit in Incheon to serve as special agents, and were arrested by the Korean-Chinese side on November 17th for crossing the Military Demarcation Line to carry out special agent activities. These facts have completely exposed the lies of the U.S. side.

    朝鲜军事停战委员会现场调查证实
    美方派遣特务进行敌对活动
    新华社平壤25日电　据朝鲜中央通讯社讯：朝鲜军事停战委员会第二联合观察小组23日和24日在第二一二号军事分界线标志附近进行现场调查的结果，完全证实美方派遣特务越过军事分界线进行敌对活动的事实。
    11月20日越过军事分界线以后被朝中方面行政警察逮捕的美方特务金学俊（原名李学顺）和李胜烈在进行调查过程中供认，金学俊本来是共和国北部南浦水产事业所“南浦十八号”渔船的船长。今年4月27日，他同李胜烈、李昌一、沈仁焕等六人在南浦前海德岛附近捕鱼的时候，被李承晚集团的海军舰艇和伪装为渔船的武装船只用武力劫往南朝鲜。金学俊和李胜烈被送到仁川市的李伪军特务部队“狮子三十三”部队中受了五个月的特务训练。11月20日，金学俊和李胜烈接到“狮子三十三”部队长的命令，并且在李伪军的指引下越过军事分界线，在朝中方面非军事区内潜伏，进行刺探军事情报的活动。在当天的十九时三十分，金李二人被朝中方面捕获。
    联合观察小组还对金学俊等携带的物品进行了调查。他们携带的鞋子、衣服等物品上的字样和商标表明这些东西都是美国或南朝鲜制造的，金学俊等供认，他们带这些物品是为了收买妇女儿童用的。
    根据调查过程中证明的事实，朝中方面建议由联合观察小组双方成员共同向军事停战委员会提出特别报告。美方竟不顾事实加以拒绝。
    关于“南浦十八号”渔船在共和国北部的领海上被美方劫走的事件，朝中方面曾经在今年5月13日的军事停战委员会秘书长会议上向美方提出抗议，并且要求美方立即遣返上述船只和船上的人员。美方在过了六个月以后却在11月4日的秘书长会议上抵赖说没有发生这件事情。但是，目前的情况表明，除了金学俊和李胜烈二人以外，这艘渔船上的七名船员中的李昌一和沈仁焕也已经在被送往仁川“狮子九十五”部队充当特务以后，在11月17日越过军事分界线进行特务活动而被朝中方面逮捕。这些事实已经完全戳穿了美方的谎言。
