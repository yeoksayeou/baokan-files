    First Time Going to the Countryside
    Peng Pai

    Today is the 30th anniversary of the founding of China's first worker-peasant regime - the Hailufeng Soviet. We are re-publishing an excerpt from an article by Comrade Peng Pai, the leader of the Hailufeng Soviet, as a commemoration. Comrade Peng Pai began working with peasants in 1921. This article records his first contact with peasants when he went to the countryside. The article is excerpted from Comrade Peng Pai's "The Hai-feng Peasant Movement" (published in 1926), with the title added by the editors of this newspaper. – Editor

    One day in May, I began to carry out the peasant movement, initially going to a village in the Chishan area. When I arrived, I was wearing a white student uniform and a white pith helmet. A peasant in his thirties saw me coming. While working with manure in front of the village, he said to me, "Sir, please sit down, have a smoke! Are you here to collect donations? We're not putting on a show here." I replied, "I'm not here to collect donations for a show. I'm here to be friends with you because I know you work hard, so I came here to chat." The peasant replied, "Ah! Suffering is our fate! Sir, please have some tea, we don't have time to chat with you, excuse me!" He ran off after saying that. Soon, another peasant in his twenties, who seemed a bit more alert, came. He asked me, "Which battalion are you from, sir? What position do you hold? What brings you here?" I replied, "I'm not an official or a soldier. I used to be a student, and today I came to your village for a leisurely visit, with the aim of making good friends with you..." He laughed and said, "We're useless people, not worthy of your official and noble children, I've said enough, please have some tea!" He turned his head and went in the other direction. I wanted to say more, but he couldn't hear me anymore. My heart was very unhappy. Recalling the words of my friends that it was a waste of energy, I felt even more troubled.

    I ran to the second village. As soon as I ran in, the dog barked loudly at me, baring its teeth at me in a show of force. I mistakenly thought it was welcoming me and rushed in, only to find that the doors were all locked. Those who went to the street went to the street, and those who went to the fields went to the fields. I ran to the third village. It was already sunset, and it was getting late. I was afraid that the peasants in the village would suspect me of doing something, so it was inconvenient to go in. So I went home. No one in my family was willing to talk to me, as if I were an enemy. After they finished eating and drinking, there was only a bucket of rice soup left. After eating some rice soup, I went to my room and opened a diary, wanting to record today's achievements in it, but the result was only a zero. I spent the whole night in bed thinking, thinking about this and that, until dawn. I got up, ate a casual breakfast, and went to the countryside again. On the road, I saw many peasants carrying taro or urine buckets to the city. When I met them on a small road, I respectfully stepped aside to let them pass first, because urban people never give way to rural people, only the burdened peasants give way to the urban people with empty hands. Therefore, at least some of the peasants must know that I am an urban person who respects them.

    I went to the village I had visited yesterday again, and met a peasant in his forties. He asked me, "Sir, are you here to collect debts?" I said, "No! No! I'm here to help you collect debts, because people owe you money, and you've forgotten, so I'm here to tell you." He said, "Ah! It's good if we don't owe anyone else's debts, how can we have debts with others?" I said, "Don't you know? Landlords are the ones who owe you the big debts. They are idle and do no work year after year. You till the fields to death, and in the end, they take the rent from you. At most, each piece of their land is worth a hundred yuan. You have been tilling for thousands of years. If you calculate, how much grain have they collected from you? We think it's really unfair, so we came to discuss with you how to get this debt back from the landlords!" He laughed and said, "It would be good if we could get it back. If we owe them even a liter or a pint, we will be locked up and beaten. Ah! This is destined by fate. Those who eat rent will always eat rent, and those who till the fields will always till the fields! Sir, please – I'm going out to the street." I asked, "Old brother, what is your honorable name?" He replied, "I am... I am in this village, please come and sit down if you have nothing to do!" I knew he was very unwilling to tell me, so I didn't ask him anymore. There were many women doing work in the village, while the men went to the fields. It was not convenient to talk to the women, so I wandered around for a long time and then went to another village.

    That day I ran to several villages, and the result was the same as yesterday, equal to zero. However, today's diary had a few more words than yesterday's.

    That evening, I suddenly thought that the words I said to the peasants were too elegant, and many of the things we said were incomprehensible to the peasants. So I translated many written terms into colloquial language. Secondly, my appearance, body, and clothing were different from the peasants. The peasants were accustomed to the oppression and deception of those with different appearances and clothing. As soon as they saw me, they suspected that I was their enemy. The two indicated different classes, incompatible with each other, and they generally didn't like to approach me. So I changed into more simple clothing, and came up with a new plan for tomorrow's activities, which was to decide not to go to the villages tomorrow, but to focus on propaganda in the crossroads where peasants travel the most.

    The next day, I went to the main road in front of the Longshan Temple. This road is the communication hub for the Chishan area, Beihu area, Chian area, and Hekou area. Countless peasants pass by here every day and rest in front of the temple. I took this opportunity to start talking to them, mainly talking about the causes of suffering and the methods of relief, and citing evidence of landlords oppressing peasants and the necessity of peasants uniting. At first, I only talked to a few people, but the more they listened, the more people gathered, and it turned into a lecture. The peasants who listened were skeptical. That day, four or five people talked to me, and more than ten people listened to my lecture. The results were the best.

    From the second day to half a month, I stood at the crossroads, talking or lecturing to the peasants passing by. About a dozen people liked to talk to me, and the number of listeners increased to thirty or forty people, a great improvement over the previous days.

    ...One day, I specifically talked about how if peasants had a group and united their strength, they could implement rent reduction. At that time, the landlords would definitely not be able to defeat us and would have to surrender. ... Zhang Ma'an came to me that evening, and he said, "After hearing your lecture, we often argue with a group of people in the village who haven't woken up yet. They are always afraid that you are lying. Several of us believe your words very much..." I then asked, "Who are those people?" He replied, "There are Lin Pei, Lin Huan, Li Laosi, Li Sixian... they are all my good friends." I said, "Can you invite them to talk tonight? You go call them, and I will prepare tea to treat them." He said, "Okay." And left. Before long, my tea was hot, and Zhang Ma'an and his friends all came. I saw that these peasant friends of his were all young peasants under thirty years old, and their actions and words were very lively. I asked them their names one by one and talked about the peasant movement. I raised a difficult question: "I go to the countryside to propagate every day, but the peasants always ignore me and are unwilling to talk to me more. Do you have any solutions?" Lin Pei said, "First, the peasants have no free time, second, the words of the gentleman are too deep, and sometimes I don't understand, and third, there is no familiar person to take you there. The best time is at seven or eight o'clock in the evening, when the countryside is very free, and we can go at this time."...

    The next morning after breakfast, peasant friends Zhang and Lin came as expected and set off together, arriving at several villages near the Chishan area. After the peasants in the village were introduced by Zhang and Lin, they felt very close to me and talked to me very sincerely. I agreed with the peasants in several nearby villages to come and listen to a speech that evening, and they agreed very much. In the evening, he prepared tables, chairs, and lights for me, and there were about six or seventy men, women, and children listening, with the children standing in front, the men standing in the middle, and the women standing in the back. What I talked about was the cause of the peasants' suffering and the fact that the landlords treated and oppressed the peasants harshly, and how the peasants should be rescued. I spoke in a question-and-answer style, so the peasants that evening agreed with my words very much and knew their ability to understand. After I finished my speech, I decided to come again the next night, with a phonograph and magic, and I would notify them in advance.

    The second day to another village was also very good. On the third day, I notified the peasants in those villages to come and watch magic and listen to a speech. When the time came, there were more than two hundred peasants, men and women, who came. I performed magic, and the peasants cheered. Taking advantage of the excitement, I gave a speech, and the result was also very good. In this way, for one or two weeks, I gained a lot of achievements. (Attached picture)

    第一次下乡
    彭湃
    今天是中国第一个工农政权——海陆丰苏维埃成立三十周年，我们节录了海陆丰苏维埃的领导人彭湃同志的文章重新发表，作为纪念。彭湃同志在1921年就开始做农民工作，这篇文章记载的就是当时他怎样第一次下乡同农民接触。文章节自彭湃同志所著“海丰农民运动”（1926年出版），题目是本报编者加的。　　——编者
    5月某日，我即开始农民运动的进行，最初到赤山约的一个乡村。我去的时候，是穿着白的学生洋服及白通帽，村中一个三十多岁的农民，看我来了，一面在村前弄粪土，一面向我说：“先生坐，请烟呀！你来收捐吗？我们这里没有做戏。”我答道：“我不是来收戏捐的，我是来和你们做朋友，因为你们辛苦，所以到这里来闲谈。”农民答道：“呀！苦是命啊！先生呀请茶，我们不得空和你闲谈，恕罪！”他说完这句话便跑了。少顷又来了一个二十多岁的农民，样子比较清醒些。他问我道：“先生属那个营？当什么差事？来何事？”我答：“我不是做官当兵的人。我前是学生，今日特来贵村闲游，目的是要来和你们做好朋友……”他笑说：“我们无用人，配不起你们官贵子弟，好说了，请茶吧！”头也不回的那边去了。我想再多说一句，可是他已听不到了，我的心头很不高兴，回想朋友们告诉我枉费精神这句话，心里更是烦恼。
    我就跑到第二个村，一跑进去，那犬儿向着我大吠特吠，张着牙齿对着我示威，我误认它是来欢迎，直冲入去，见门户都是锁着，去街的去了街，出田的出了田。再跑过第三条村，适太阳西下，天将晚了，恐怕村中农民疑我做甚么事，不便进去，乃回家。我的家里没有一个人肯对我说话，好像对着仇人一样。他们饮食完了，只剩的饭汤一斗，食了点饭汤，再到我的房子去，把一部日记打开，想把今天的成绩记在里头，结果只有一个零字。一夜在床上想法子，想东想西，到了天亮，爬起身来，随便食了一餐早饭，就再到农村去了。在路上看着许多农民挑着芋或尿桶等到城里去，若在小路相逢的时候，我是很恭敬的避在路边，让他们先过，因为城市的人每遇乡人是不让路的，只有负担的农人让那空手的城市人。所以农民至少必有一部分知道我是看重他们的一个城市人。
    我又再到昨日所到的农村来，遇着一个四十多岁的农民，他问我：“先生呀！来收账呀？”我说：“不是！不是！我是来帮你收账的，因为人家欠了你们的数（账），你们忘记了，所以我来告诉你们。”他说：“呀！不欠他家的账还是好的，怎有账在别人处？”我说：“你还不知道吗？地主便是欠你们的大账者，他年年闲逸无做工，你们耕田耕到死，结果将租谷给他收去，他们一丘田多者不过值百元，你们耕了千百年，试计算一下，你们给他收了好多谷呢？我们想起来，实在是不平，所以来和你们磋商怎样和地主拿回这笔账！”他笑道：“有得拿就好了，我们欠他一升一合还要锁打，呀！这是命中注定的，食租的久久是食租，耕田的久久是耕田！先生你请——我要出街去。”我问：“老兄你是贵姓名？”他答道：“我是……我是在这个乡村，无事请来坐吧！”我知道他很不愿意告诉我，我也不再去问他。村中女子做工者颇多，男子则出田的出田去了，女子也不便和她说话，我徘徊了好久，就再过别村去了。
    是日跑了几个乡村，结果是和昨日同等于零。不过是日的日记比昨日多说了几句话。
    是晚我忽然就想到一来我对农民所说的话，太过文雅了，好多我们说来农民都是不晓，所以就把许多书面的术语翻译做俗话，二来是我的面貌身体服装与农民不同，农民惯受了面貌服装不同者的压迫和欺骗，一见我就疑是他的敌人；二者表示阶级不同，格格不入，总不欢喜和我接近，所以乃改变较为朴实的服装，并且想出明日进行的一个新计划，就是决定明日不到乡村去，专找在农民往来最多的十字路中去宣传。
    次日就到一个龙山庙的面前的大路去，此路乃是赤山约、北笏约、赤岸约、河口约交通的孔道，每日都有无数农民在此经过，并且在庙前休息，我就乘此机会，对他们开始谈话，大概是说些痛苦的原因及救济的方法，并举出地主压迫农民之证据及农民应有团结之必要，起初只与少数人谈话，但愈听愈众，遂变成演讲的形式，农民听者都是半信半疑，是日与我谈话的有四五人，听我演讲的有十余人之多，其成绩为最好。
    由第二日以至半个月的时间，我都是站在路口，与过路农民谈话或演讲，大约喜欢和我谈者已有十余人，听讲者增至三四十人，比前大有进步。
    ……有一天，我是专讲农民如能有了团体，把自己的力量团结起来，就可实行减租，那时地主一定是敌不过我们，只好束手待毙。……张妈安君于是晚来找我，他说：“我们听见你讲演以后，每每与乡村里头一班未睡醒的人驳论，他们总是恐怕你说谎，我们有几个很相信你的说话……。”我接着就问道：“那几位呢？”他答：“有林沛，林焕，李老四，李思贤……通通是我的好朋友。”我说：“今晚可请他们来谈话吗？你去叫他们，我就备茶来待。”他说：“好。”就去了。不好久，我的茶热了，张妈安君和他的朋友通都来了，我看他这几位农友，都是不上三十岁的青年农民，举动说话，都很活泼，我就一一问了他们的姓名，谈起农民的运动了。我提出一个困难的问题：“我天天下乡去宣传，农民总不理我，总不愿意和我多谈点话，你们有何办法？”林沛说：“第一是农民不得空闲，第二是先生的话太深，有时我也不晓，第三是没有熟悉的人带你去。最好是晚间七八点钟的时间，农村很得空闲，我们可在这时候去。”……
    次早饭后，张林二农友果来了，一同出发，到了赤山约附近几个乡村。村中农民经过张林二人介绍之后，觉得和我很亲密，而且很诚恳的和我谈话。我就约定附近几个乡的农民今晚来此听演说，他们很赞成。及晚，他备好桌椅及灯火等我了，听的男女小孩约有六七十人，小孩站在前面，男的站在中间，女的站在后头。我所讲的，就是农民痛苦的原因，及地主苛待压迫农民之事实，农民应如何解救。我讲时是问答式，所以是晚农民很赞成我的话，并知道他们理解的能力。我演说毕，并定改晚再来时，设有留声机，还有魔术，届时必先通知他们。
    第二日到别个乡，也很好。第三日，我就通知那几个乡村的农民来看魔术，并听演说。时间到了，来的农民男女有二百余人，我演了魔术，农民就喝彩，我乘兴就演说，结果也是很好。如是者有一两个星期，所得成绩不少。（附图片）
