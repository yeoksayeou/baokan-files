    Everyone Contributes Ideas to Broaden Fertilizer Sources
    Houzihe Commune in Xining Finds 21 Methods for Accumulating Fertilizer
    Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The Houzihe Agricultural Commune in the suburbs of Xining, after discussing the requirements of the revised draft of the National Agricultural Development Program and researching 21 methods for accumulating fertilizer based on the commune's specific situation, has launched an unprecedented high tide of fertilizer accumulation.
    In this commune, at dusk, the teams shouting and pulling plows through the lanes are the shock brigades scraping up the old soil from the road surface. In the early morning and moonlit nights, the children's manure-collecting teams are everywhere searching for animal dung with baskets on their backs. The age-old chimney stoves have been converted into "ox-tail stoves" that can smoke soil clods. The habit of never collecting urine has been changed, and the slogan "Every household has a urine jar, every team builds a urine pool" is being realized. Every family is clearing out gutters and garbage pits. The commune is also preparing to help some members dismantle and rebuild old kitchens, taking roof soil, stove soil, and old wall soil for fertilizer. Currently, along the roadsides and corners of the village, piles of manure, kang fertilizer, and soil fertilizer are growing higher and higher. The commune's accumulated fertilizer exceeds 18% of this year's total fertilizer application, and it is estimated that 66.8 million jin of fertilizer can be accumulated before next spring plowing, with each mu of wheat land receiving more than 7,700 jin of fertilizer, and wheat production will double compared to this year.
    According to the production experience collected from experienced farmers in the commune and the test results from agricultural science institutions, 1,000 jin of smoked soil clods can equal 20 jin of cake fertilizer. Old roof soil, old wall soil, and road surface soil are more effective than burned ash fertilizer, and 1,000 jin of human urine equals 20 jin of chemical fertilizer. This commune can accumulate 3,000 jin of human urine in one night. After debate, everyone said, "It turns out that our cooperative is equivalent to a small chemical fertilizer factory." Thus, everyone contributed ideas, and the commune's management committee summarized 21 experiences in accumulating fertilizer based on the opinions of the masses.
    Due to the relentless efforts to develop various fertilizer sources, the Houzihe Agricultural Commune has great confidence in completing next year's production increase plan. The commune members say that as long as they cultivate carefully, it is not a problem to increase the yield of each mu of irrigated land from 390 jin this year to 500 jin next year.

### 人人献计　广辟肥源  西宁后子河社找出21项积肥办法

    人人献计　广辟肥源
    西宁后子河社找出21项积肥办法
    新华社讯　西宁郊区后子河农业社在讨论全国农业发展纲要修正草案的要求，结合本社情况研究出二十一项攒积肥料的办法以后，一个空前的积肥高潮掀起来了。
    在这个社每到黄昏时分，牵引着犁铧在巷道里吆喝的，是刮取路面陈土的突击队。清晨和月夜背着背斗到处搜集畜粪的，是少年儿童拾粪队。世代流传的烟筒灶改装成可以熏土块的牛尾灶了。从来不积尿的习惯改变了，“户户有尿罐，队队修尿池”的口号正在实现。每家都在掏阴沟，清垃圾坑。社里还准备帮助部分社员拆除和重建旧厨房，取屋顶土、灶土和老墙土做肥料。目前，村里的路边墙角，一堆堆的粪肥、炕肥、土肥越垒越高。全社储积的肥料超过了今年总施肥量的18％，估计到明年春耕前可以积肥六千六百八十万斤，每亩麦地施肥七千七百多斤，麦子产量将比今年增加一倍。
    据这个社搜集老农的生产经验和农业科学机构的化验结果，一千斤熏过的土块可以顶二十斤饼肥，旧房顶土、老墙土、路面土比烧的灰肥效率高，一千斤人尿顶二十斤化学肥料。这个社一夜就可以积人尿三千斤。经过辩论，大家都说：“原来我们合作社就顶一个小型化学肥料厂。”于是人人献计，社的管理委员会根据群众意见总结出二十一项积肥的经验。
    由于千方百计开辟了各种肥源，后子河农业社对完成明年增产计划的信心很高。社员们说，只要细致耕作，明年每亩水浇地的产量由今年的三百九十斤提高到五百斤是不成问题的。
