(Comprehensive report from this newspaper) According to Xinhua News Agency: Tunisian President Bourguiba and Moroccan King Mohammed V issued a joint communiqué on the evening of the 21st, calling on both France and Algeria to hold negotiations to seek a solution to the Algerian issue, and expressing their willingness to "mediate" between France and Algeria.

The communiqué believes that this solution should protect the "legitimate interests of France and French nationals" within Algeria; however, the communiqué did not propose any preconditions for holding negotiations.

The Algerian National Liberation Front issued a communiqué on the 22nd, supporting the mediation proposal put forward by the King of Morocco and the President of Tunisia. The National Liberation Front said in the communiqué that it believes that formal negotiations based on Algeria's independence can "end the bloodshed and destruction of the colonial war" and "rebuild peace between France and Algeria."

On the other hand, French Foreign Minister Pineau, who is currently in New York preparing to participate in the United Nations General Assembly debate on the Algerian issue, issued a statement to the press on the 23rd, rejecting the "mediation" proposal put forward by Tunisia and Morocco.

    突摩两国元首关切阿尔及利亚问题
    愿在法阿间进行斡旋
    阿方表示支持　法方悍然拒绝
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：突尼斯总统布尔吉巴和摩洛哥国王穆罕默德五世在21日晚上发表联合公报，呼吁法国和阿尔及利亚双方为求得阿尔及利亚问题的解决而举行谈判，并且表示他们愿意在法国和阿尔及利亚之间进行“斡旋”。
    公报认为，这种解决办法应该保护阿尔及利亚境内“法国和法国国民的正当利益”；但是，公报没有提出举行谈判的先决条件。
    阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线22日发表了一项公报，支持摩洛哥国王和突尼斯总统提出的斡旋建议。民族解放阵线在公报中说，它相信以阿尔及利亚的独立为基础举行的正式谈判，可以“结束殖民战争的流血和破坏”，“重建法国和阿尔及利亚之间的和平”。
    另一方面，目前正在纽约准备参加联合国大会关于阿尔及利亚问题辩论的法国外交部长比诺23日对报界发表声明，拒绝突尼斯和摩洛哥所提出的关于“斡旋”的建议。
