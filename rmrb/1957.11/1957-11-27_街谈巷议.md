    Street Talk and Alley Discussions
    How can I not be happy!
    My father wrote in a letter: "Buses can now come right to our village. The villagers are all going to the road to watch. Everyone is shouting: This is really the Communist Party and Chairman Mao's good world!" This exciting news makes it impossible for me to quietly study! My hometown is in the remote mountains of western Guangxi, a minority area, surrounded by high mountains and steep peaks, without even a half-li of flat land. For years, people there have relied on their own two legs, climbing mountains and crossing ridges to make a living. Three years ago, when I left my hometown to study in Beijing, I carried my luggage on my back, walking step by step under the hot summer sun, over mountain after mountain, ridge after ridge, suffering for several days on the narrow mountain paths before reaching the train station. But, three years later, everything has changed. A big road has replaced the narrow mountain paths, and buses have replaced people's arduous walking. How can these things not make me happy!

    Can this method be changed?
    At the ticket window of the Shaodong Bus Station, passengers lined up in a long queue to buy tickets for the day.
    "Comrade, buy three tickets!" a middle-aged passenger shouted in a sincere and expectant tone.
    "No, one ticket per person!"
    "What do you mean, no? Does the whole family have to line up?!"
    "Only one ticket is allowed per person!"
    The passenger was a little angry: "How can you be so mechanical?"
    "Mechanical?!" the ticket seller retorted: "This is to take care of the majority!"
    The passenger had no choice but to ask his wife and his elderly mother to join the queue. Of course, the tickets were all bought, but for three different departures: one at 11 a.m., one at 3 p.m., and one at 3:30 p.m.
    The passenger went to the stationmaster and said, "Look, the family is scattered on three buses. If it rains, who will take care of them!"
    But no matter what he said, it didn't work.
    People really wonder, why can't this method be changed?

    Not good for children
    In the morning or afternoon, you can often see people lining up in front of some grocery stores to buy meat, eggs, and other things. People's lives have improved, and the supply of some non-staple foods cannot meet the demand, so they have to be rationed. There's nothing wrong with that. However, some people bring their children to line up, some with three or four children, even four or five-year-old toddlers standing in line, taking up a share. This is not good. Firstly, it goes against the meaning of queuing to buy, taking up more than others; secondly, it is not good for the education of children. Isn't this teaching them to take petty advantages from a young age? It also delays the children from reviewing their homework.

    怎能不高兴呢！
    爸爸来信说：“汽车已经通行到我们村来了，村里的人都到公路旁边去看，大家都高声嚷着：这真是共产党和毛主席的好世界啊！”这个振奋人心的消息，我怎能安静下来念书呢？我的故乡在广西桂西的山野里，很偏僻，是少数民族地区，周围都是高山峻岭，连半里的平地都没有。多少年来，那里的人们都靠着两条腿，爬山越岭谋生。三年前，我离开家乡来北京念书的时候，自己背着行李，在炎热的夏日的太阳下，一步一步地走过一山又一山，一岭又一岭，苦行了几天的羊肠小道才到火车站。可是，三年后的今天，一切都变了，大公路代替了羊肠小道，汽车代替了人们艰苦的步行。这些叫我怎能不高兴呢！

    这办法能不能改？
    在邵东汽车站的售票窗口前，旅客们排成一长队买当天的车票。
    “同志，买三张票！”一个中年旅客用恳切、期望的口吻喊道。
    “不行，一人一张！”
    “怎么，不行？难道一家人都要排队？！”
    “一人只准买一张！”
    旅客有些气愤了：“你们怎么这样机械？”
    “机械？！”售票员用反问的口气道：“这是照顾大多数！”
    旅客无可奈何，只好叫他爱人和他年迈的母亲排上队。票当然都买到了，可是三个不同的车次；一张是上午十一点，一张是下午三点，一张是三点半。
    旅客去找站长说：“你看，一家人分散在三辆车上，下雨天，谁照顾！”
    可是怎么说也不行。
    人们真奇怪，为什么这办法不能改一改？

    对孩子没有好处
    清晨或者下午，在一些买副食品的商店门口，经常可以见到人们排着队买肉、鸡蛋和别的东西，人民的生活都改善了，有些副食品供不应求，自然得匀着点买。这没什么。可是，有些人把家里的孩子也带来排队，有的人带上三、四个孩子，甚至四、五岁的娃娃也排在队里，占上一份，这就不好了。一来违背了排队购买的意义，多占了别人的；二来对孩子的教育上也不好，这不是从小就教他们占小便宜吗？又耽误孩子温习功课。
