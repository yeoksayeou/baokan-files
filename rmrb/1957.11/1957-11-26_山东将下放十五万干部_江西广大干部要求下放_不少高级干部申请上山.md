Shandong to Send Down 150,000 Cadres

Jiangxi’s Vast Number of Cadres Request to be Sent Down; Many Senior Cadres Apply to Go to the Mountains

(Our Dispatch from Jinan, November 25) The Shandong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has initially decided that the province will transfer 150,000 cadres (including the more than 30,000 already transferred) to grassroots positions or to participate in agricultural production.

The rectification movement in the provincial and municipal organs, some prefectural organs, and 381 units such as enterprise and institutional management in Shandong has entered the rectification and reform stage. The situation in each unit during the "big blooming and contending" shows that streamlining institutions and transferring cadres downward is not only a widespread demand of the vast number of cadres, but has also become a central issue in improving work and effectively overcoming bureaucracy. Therefore, the Provincial Party Committee requires that the leading aspects of Party committees and departments at all levels must make the greatest determination to implement the policy of building the country with diligence and thrift in a revolutionary spirit, fully mobilize the masses, streamline institutions, improve work methods and work systems, and complete the reorganization work in batches.

Jinan and Qingdao took action earlier. The first group of 479 cadres who went to the suburbs to participate in agricultural production went to agricultural cooperatives for production on the 24th and 20th, respectively.

(Our Dispatch from Nanchang, November 25) Party members and the vast number of cadres in Jiangxi Province are actively responding to the Party's call, and are applying to go to the mountains and countryside to build prosperous and happy new mountain areas and new rural areas.

Many senior cadres in provincial-level organs are taking the lead in applying to go to the mountains. Li Chao, Deputy Director of the Provincial Department of Finance, who has been through a long period of revolutionary struggle, was the first to submit an application to the Provincial Party Committee to go to the mountains. Hu Ruiying, Deputy Director of the Provincial Women's Federation, who had achieved remarkable results in wasteland reclamation in Yan'an during the Anti-Japanese War, discussed arrangements for household affairs with her husband, Huang Lin, Minister of Transportation of the Provincial Party Committee, and also submitted a request to the Party to go to the mountains. Under her influence, 19 cadres from the Provincial Women's Federation organs have applied to go to the mountains. The majority of leading cadres at all levels of the Provincial Communist Youth League organs have requested to go to the mountains and countryside, including members of the Standing Committee of the Provincial Communist Youth League, directors and deputy directors of departments, directors and deputy directors of sections, and the editors-in-chief and deputy editors-in-chief and heads and deputy heads of groups of the Jiangxi Youth Daily. The Lushan Party Committee, in order to gradually build Lushan, a summer resort, into a prosperous and diversified production base, is preparing to establish and develop large-scale cloud and mist tea farms, rabbit farms, poultry farms, pig farms, sheep farms, horticultural farms, and forest farms.
