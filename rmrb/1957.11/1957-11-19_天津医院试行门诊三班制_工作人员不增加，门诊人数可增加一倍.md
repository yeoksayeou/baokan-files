Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, November 16th. The Tianjin Medical College Affiliated Hospital began piloting a "three-shift" system for outpatient services on the 15th. The outpatient clinic is open 24 hours a day, and patients can register and seek treatment at any time. This is a major measure taken by the hospital during rectification to solve the outpatient congestion problem that has been unresolved for several years.

Today, many sick cadres, workers, and students came to see a doctor for the first time outside of work and study hours. More than 100 patients registered for treatment in the afternoon from 4:00 PM to 8:00 PM alone. Yuan Huating, an employee of the Tianjin Pencil Factory, suffered from headaches and registered on September 27th, but had not been able to see a doctor due to outpatient congestion and his busy work schedule. Today, he came to the hospital for treatment after getting off work.

During the recent period of airing views and speaking out freely, medical personnel at this hospital posted nearly fifty big-character posters criticizing and suggesting improvements to the outpatient system. Patients also raised many opinions about the hospital because the time for registration, seeing a doctor, and obtaining medicine was too long, and the consultation time was too short. The hospital's Communist Party organization mobilized hospital staff to discuss the outpatient congestion problem and assessed the hospital's medical resources. After research and discussion, the original outpatient department and emergency department were merged, with only one person specifically assigned to identify emergency patients, saving a large amount of manpower and material resources. The system was changed to a three-shift system, so that the outpatient volume could be doubled without adding personnel. To strengthen the leadership of the outpatient department, a vice president also serves as the director of the outpatient department office. Appropriate solutions have also been provided for the hospital employees' life, welfare, and study issues after the implementation of the "three-shift" system.

    天津医院试行门诊三班制
    工作人员不增加，门诊人数可增加一倍
    新华社天津16日电　天津医学院附属医院15日开始试行门诊“三班制”。每天二十四小时开放门诊，病人随时可以挂号治病。这是这个医院在整改中的一项重大的措施，解决了几年来没法解决的门诊拥挤的问题。
    今天许多有病的干部、工人、学生第一次不在工作和学习时间前来看病，仅下午四时到八时挂号就诊的病人就有一百多人。天津铅笔厂职员袁华庭患脑痛，在9月27日就挂了号，但一直因为门诊拥挤和自己工作忙，没有能来看病。今天他下班后来到医院治疗。
    在最近鸣放期间，这个医院医务人员贴出了近五十张大字报对门诊制度提出了批评和建议。病人们也因为挂号、看病和取药的时间太长，诊治的时间太短，对医院提出很多意见。医院中共党组织，发动医院职工专就门诊拥挤问题展开讨论，并对全院的医疗力量算了账。经过研究讨论，随即将原来的门诊部和急症部合并只设一专人来鉴别急症病人，节省出大批人力物力，改成三班制，这样，不用添人，门诊量可以增加一倍。为了加强门诊部的领导有一位副院长兼任门诊部办公室主任。对于改为“三班制”以后医院职工的生活福利学习等问题也已经给以适当解决。
