	Exemplary Action
	Chen Zhiyan
	One hundred and fifty households, totaling two hundred and seventy-two family members of workers from the Beijing No. 1 State-owned Cotton Mill, have returned to their hometowns to participate in agricultural production. In the nationwide surge of "going to the countryside and up to the mountains," this may seem like a small wave, but it illustrates the exemplary action of the working class, making "difficult problems" in enterprises, which were once considered hard to solve, readily solvable.

	Not long ago, we saw this scene and heard this voice in many cities: "Housing, housing, please leaders, solve the housing problem." These were the demands of some workers.

	As a result, many factories built dormitory buildings one after another. However, the more houses built, the more insufficient they became. What was the problem? More family members moved into the cities, and more children were born. And the scope of "family members" expanded, including immediate relatives, collateral relatives, and even "relatives" with no kinship at all. Why not move into the city? The houses are good and cheap. So, families of thousands from the countryside followed the workers to the cities. With them came not only housing shortages but also an increased burden on all aspects of the city.

	Since they have come, how can we drive them away? Let's build more family dormitories. But when will it be enough? And do we still need socialist industrialization? As a result, the housing problem became an unsolvable one in the minds of many enterprise leaders.

	The rectification movement, the great blooming, great contending, and great debate, found a way to solve this "difficult problem." The working class, with its exemplary action, helped the country and the enterprise, mobilizing family members who originally came from the countryside to return to the countryside to produce. This is the correct conclusion to the problem. And the recent draft regulations on home visits and vacations for employees issued by the State Council are a great encouragement for family members to return to their hometowns to produce.

	Family members of workers from the Beijing No. 1 State-owned Cotton Mill and some other factories have already begun to take action. A small wave will stir up a huge wave. We believe that family members of workers in various industrial and mining enterprises across the country will actively respond to the glorious call of "returning to the countryside for production."

    模范的行动
    陈之衍
    北京国棉一厂的一百五十户共二百七十二名职工家属回乡参加农业生产去了。在澎湃全国的“下乡上山”的浪潮里，这似乎只是一个微小的浪花，然而它却说明了工人阶级的模范行动，使得企业里一向被认为很难解决的“难题”可以迎刃而解了。
    就在不久以前，我们在许多城市看到这种景象，听到这种呼声：房子，房子，请领导上解决房子问题。这是一些工人们的要求。
    于是许多工厂，都兴建了一幢幢的宿舍大楼。可是房子盖得越多，房子越不够住。问题在哪里？家属进城多、孩子生得多。而“家属”的范围越来越扩大，有直系亲属，有旁系亲属，还有根本没有亲属关系的“亲属”。为什么不进城呢？房子好，又便宜。于是一千人的工厂、几千人的家属从农村跟着来了。跟着来的不仅是房子紧张，而且加重了城市各方面的负担。
    既然来了，怎么能把别人撵走呢？再多盖些家属宿舍吧。可是盖到什么时候算够呢？而且我们还要不要社会主义工业化呢？于是房子问题在许多企业负责同志的脑海里成为一个无法解决的问题。
    整风运动，大鸣大放大辩论，为解决这个“难题”找到了途径。工人阶级用自己的模范行动帮助国家、帮助企业，动员原来从农村来的家属回到农村去生产。这就是问题的正确结论。而国务院最近发布的关于职工回家探亲假期的规定（草案），对家属回乡生产更是一种莫大的鼓励。
    北京国棉一厂以及其它一些工厂的职工家属们已经开始行动了。微波将激成巨浪，我们相信全国各个工矿企业的职工家属们都会积极响应“回乡生产”这个光荣的号召。
