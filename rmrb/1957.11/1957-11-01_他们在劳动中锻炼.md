    They Temper Themselves in Labor
    In the workshops of the Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Plant, thirteen university graduates were recently assigned by the state. They put on blue worker's uniforms and, under the guidance of experienced masters, have been learning how to operate various machine tools for production techniques for half a month. This group of new workers are graduates from Jiaotong University, Zhejiang University, or engineering institutes in Huazhong, Shandong, and other places.
    Beside a gantry planer in the No. 5 processing workshop, He Shi, a graduate from Huazhong Institute of Technology who is preparing to process the bed of a 1Д63 lathe, told reporters that he studied machine manufacturing technology at school, but had never independently operated a machine tool. Now, master worker Wang Shaoen has taught him to master processing techniques such as tool setting and finding the center line. He is determined to learn how to operate this gantry planer within two months, and then spend ten months learning the processing techniques of precision machine tools such as boring machines and guideway grinders from his master.
    In the foundry workshop, Xu Shaojun, a graduate from Zhejiang University specializing in casting technology, is learning from veteran workers how to manually check the wet strength of molding sand. In conversation, he constantly praised the rich experience and accurate judgment of the master workers. For half a month, he has been carefully observing and learning some practical knowledge that is not found in books alongside the veteran workers next to the sand mixer, which is rotating gigantic wheels.

    他们在劳动中锻炼
    在沈阳第一机床厂的车间里，最近国家分配来了十三名大学毕业生。他们穿上了蓝色的工人服，在老师傅的指导下，学习操纵各种机床生产技术已有半个月了。这批新的工人是交通大学、浙江大学、或是华中、山东等地工学院毕业的。
    在五号加工车间一座龙门刨床旁，正在准备加工一台一Д六三床身的华中工学院毕业生何适对记者说：他在学校里学的是机器制造工艺，但在过去没有独立操纵过机床。现在老师傅王绍恩已经教给他掌握对刀、找中心线等加工技术了。他决心在两个月内学会操纵这台龙门刨床，再用十个月的时间向师傅学会镗床、导轨磨等精密机床的加工技术。
    在铸造车间里，一位参加生产的浙江大学专修铸造工艺的毕业生许绍均，他正向老工人学习用手抽查型砂的湿强度。谈话中，他不断地称赞老师傅们丰富的经验和准确的判断力。半个月来他跟老工人在旋转着巨轮的碾砂机旁，已经细心的观察和学到一些书本上所没有的实际知识。　（文）
