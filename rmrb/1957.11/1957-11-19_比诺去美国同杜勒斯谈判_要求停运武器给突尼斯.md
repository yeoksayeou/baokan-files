Xinhua News Agency, 18th dispatch from Paris: French Foreign Minister Bidault flew to the United States on the midnight of the 17th to hold emergency negotiations with U.S. Secretary of State Dulles regarding the issue of the U.S. and Britain supplying weapons to Tunisia.

Before taking off, Bidault said that his trip aims to find a way to "remedy" the situation and "limit" the "damage" caused by the U.S. and Britain's arms shipments to Tunisia. At the same time, he will also study issues related to the "existence and strengthening of the Atlantic Treaty."

He said that this incident had caused France "such a strong and profound shock" that it "will take a long time to forget this American action." He said he would explain to Dulles the "serious uneasiness and sharp reactions this incident has aroused among the French public and parliament." He said that the problems in the relationship between France and the U.S. and Britain must first be resolved before the summit meeting of the North Atlantic Group countries in mid-December.

It is revealed that Bidault will demand, in his talks with Dulles, that the cessation of arms shipments to Tunisia and full U.S. support for France's position in Algeria be the price for France's continued support for the North Atlantic Group. However, diplomatic sources in Paris pointed out that Bidault's hopes of achieving these two goals are not high.

According to news from London, the British side may propose holding a meeting of the foreign ministers of the U.S., Britain, and France to bridge the rift between the three countries over the issue of arms shipments to Tunisia.

    比诺去美国同杜勒斯谈判
    要求停运武器给突尼斯
    新华社18日讯　巴黎消息：法国外交部长比诺17日午夜飞往美国，同美国国务卿杜勒斯就美英两国供给突尼斯武器问题举行紧急谈判。
    比诺在起飞前发表谈话说，他此行目的是要设法“补救”局势和“限制”由于美英运武器给突尼斯而造成的“损害”，同时还将研究有关“大西洋公约的存在和加强”的问题。
    他说，这次事件使法国“受到了这样强烈和深刻的刺激”，以致它“需要很长时间才能忘记美国的这次行动”。他说，他将向杜勒斯说明这次事件“在法国公众和议会中间所引起的严重不安和尖锐反映”。他说，在12月中旬举行北大西洋集团各国首脑会议之前，法国同美英两国的关系问题必须首先获得解决。
    据透露，比诺将在同杜勒斯的会谈中要求以停止运送武器给突尼斯和美国充分支持法国在阿尔及利亚的地位，来作为法国继续支持北大西洋集团的代价。但是，巴黎外交界人士指出，比诺达到这两个目的的希望是不大的。
    另据伦敦传来的消息说，英国方面可能倡议举行一次美英法三国外长会议来弥合三国在运送武器给突尼斯问题上的裂痕。
