Xinhua News Agency, 9th. The State Council Science Planning Commission has formulated four plans to improve the conditions for scientific research work: national book coordination, improvement of archives and materials work, improvement of the production, repair and supply of scientific instruments, and improvement of chemical reagent work.

    National Book Coordination Plan
    The National Book Coordination Plan proposes that the establishment of central libraries and the compilation of a national union catalog of books should be the priorities at present. The tasks of the central library are: (1) To serve scientific research work; (2) To collect books and periodicals of a wide variety and high quality that should be collected; (3) To compile union catalogs and new book bulletins; (4) To carry out international book exchange work (carried out by some national central libraries); (5) To carry out photographic reproduction of books, which is carried out by some central libraries; (6) To plan and carry out cadre training work.
    The national central libraries are composed of several of the most well-established libraries in Beijing (first center) and Shanghai (second center). The Beijing Library should become the core of the national library system and the guidance center for library services. Regional central libraries are temporarily determined to be located in Wuhan, Shenyang, Nanjing, Guangzhou, Chengdu, Xi'an, Lanzhou, Tianjin, and Harbin, with certain libraries designated to take on the task. The list of libraries is to be considered and decided by the People's Committees of the respective provinces and cities. The locations of regional central libraries will be increased as needed and as possible in the future.
    The public libraries (such as the Beijing Library), the Chinese Academy of Sciences Library, and specialized scientific libraries (such as medical, agricultural, and geological libraries) in the national central libraries should be open to scientific workers nationwide. The libraries affiliated to universities and colleges should, in addition to ensuring the needs of teachers and students of their own schools, be open to relevant scientific workers as much as possible according to the specialties of each library (such as the Beijing Normal University Library being open to educational science workers) to supplement the shortcomings of public libraries. In the future, professional libraries in Beijing, Shanghai, or other regions will be successively designated as central libraries as needed and as possible.
    Since the national and regional central libraries are jointly composed of several libraries, in order to unify pace and strengthen cooperation, a central library committee can be formed by the heads of each library. Their tasks are: (1) To assist the Science Planning (or Working) Commission or administrative leading departments in studying the overall arrangements and comprehensive planning of libraries; (2) To study and solve business problems related to the division of labor and cooperation between central libraries, including book procurement, allocation, exchange, and interlibrary lending; (3) To study issues related to the compilation of union catalogs and new book bulletins and to formulate plans; (4) To study issues related to improving the professional skills of cadres.
    While establishing central libraries, the allocation of excessive copies and unreasonable collections should be gradually carried out in a planned manner.
    A national union catalog editing group should be established under the National Central Library Committee and attached to the Beijing Library. Its tasks are: (1) To understand and investigate the book collection and cataloging situation of libraries across the country; (2) To formulate a union catalog editing plan; (3) To draft union catalog cataloging regulations;
  (4) To strengthen contact with each library regarding union catalog work, to arrange, inspect, and supervise the work; (5) To comprehensively arrange, proofread, and publish the catalogs of each library. The units participating in the compilation of the union catalog are based on the Chinese Academy of Sciences and its affiliated institute libraries, the libraries of various universities and colleges, and public and professional libraries above the provincial level, and units are selected to participate in the compilation according to the different topics. The special union catalogs currently being edited or planned include six types, such as the Union Catalog of Chinese Revolutionary History. Nine types, including the Union Catalog of Western Periodicals, have been edited since July 1957 and are required to be completed by the end of 1959.
      Improvement Plan for Archival Information Work
    The plan for improving archival information work proposes that:
    I. A unified management system for archival information work must be established to strengthen the organization, utilization, sorting and preservation of archives and materials. The State Archives Bureau is the national agency in charge of archives and information work. The State Archives Bureau should supervise and inspect the establishment of national archives and various professional archives and information centers. At present, in addition to the archives having separate plans, the State Technology Commission, the State Construction Commission, the Ministry of Geology, the Ministry of Agriculture, and the State Statistical Bureau can separately start unified data management work for industry and transportation, basic construction, geology, agriculture, and economy.
    II. Several methods regarding the utilization and exchange of information: (1) Certain departments may consider printing regular or irregular information publications. (2) The State Archives Bureau should understand the existing archival information situation of various departments and regularly organize exchanges. (3) After the existing information is sorted out, all information that can be made public and is in great demand can be published publicly. Yearbooks and information compilations can be compiled and printed. Some information can be printed and distributed as internal information. (4) The archival information management institutions of each department can set up reading rooms and establish borrowing systems when conditions permit. (5) Relevant agencies, enterprises, schools, and scientific research institutions can strengthen ties and exchange information through contracts. The units that supply the information should be able to actively provide it, and the units that need the information can avoid demanding information excessively and repeatedly.
    III. In order to solve the confidentiality issues in the supply of information, the following methods are proposed: (1) Within an agency, enterprise, school, and research institution, the staff of the unit can borrow the information they need within their scope of work. Interns can generally enjoy the same treatment as similar staff in the internship unit when borrowing information, but borrowing certain confidential information should be approved in accordance with the regulations of the unit.
  (2) Units with the same or similar nature in production, teaching, and scientific research can supply each other with necessary information, except for special regulations. The information supply unit can fix the main units that need general information (such as schools and research institutions) as units equivalent to its own system and actively provide general information. (3) The personnel who borrow confidential information between departments can be introduced by the unit where they are located. Approval procedures should be appropriately improved to facilitate the work. (4) Any information that has been made public abroad, as well as survey, exploration, mapping, or other information made by foreigners in China before liberation, can be borrowed by relevant personnel as long as the work requires it. (5) Any information investigated, researched, designed, and drawn by the staff of agencies, enterprises, schools, and research institutions themselves can be borrowed by themselves at any time after it is turned over to the information management department.
  (6) In addition to the above points, each department can also stipulate the method of supplying information according to the specific conditions of the unit. (7) The personnel who borrow information are subject to review by the sending unit, and the receiving unit generally does not review it, but may raise objections if any problems are found. (8) The personnel who borrow information should bear full responsibility for confidentiality of confidential information in accordance with the confidentiality requirements of the information supply unit. Improve the program for the production, repair and supply of scientific instruments
    The plan for improving the production, repair, and supply of scientific instruments proposes that:
    I. Regarding the production of scientific instruments: (1) In addition to increasing the output and improving the quality of existing varieties to meet needs, all instrument production departments should vigorously develop new varieties. Varieties that have been produced in the past should continue to be produced as long as there is still a social need, and the varieties should not be reduced. At the same time, measures should be taken to enable and make each production department willing to undertake the production of small quantities of special instruments to ensure the special needs of scientific research work. (2) In order to facilitate the planned arrangement of production and trial production of new varieties by various industrial departments and to better meet the needs for scientific instruments, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Higher Education Department, and other user departments should organize relevant institutions and scientists to provide the varieties and quantities of instruments needed this year and during the Second Five-Year Plan as much as possible, and submit them to the State Technology Commission for arranging trial production and production in conjunction with relevant departments. In order to solve the special materials needed in the current production of scientific instruments, all departments that have factories and research institutions capable of producing special materials should expand production as much as possible to supply the needs of all parties. At the same time, special materials should be imported in a planned manner to expand the domestic production of scientific instruments and correspondingly reduce the import of instruments. (3) The State Technology Commission should establish instrument and meter appraisal work in conjunction with relevant departments as soon as possible. (4) In order to rapidly develop the scientific instrument industry, all instrument production enterprises should strengthen ties with scientific research institutions, universities and colleges, and scientists, and strive for their technical and business guidance and assistance. All scientific research institutions and universities and colleges should also actively promote their research results to relevant enterprises and put forward suggestions for improving instrument production. At the same time, the affiliated factories and workshops of scientific research institutions and universities and colleges can produce more specialized instruments or assist enterprises in manufacturing certain special parts to facilitate the development of the instrument industry.
    II. Regarding the repair and fitting of scientific instruments: In principle, it is stipulated that whoever manufactures domestic products should repair them and should accept the repair work of the same type of products in the same region; the repair and fitting of foreign imported instruments should be undertaken by relevant enterprises organized by region, roughly divided by product, to expand the repair and fitting force. (1) General instrument production enterprises should accept the repair and fitting work of corresponding products and can reserve 1%-5% of their capacity in the annual plan to accept repair and fitting tasks. Enterprises that produce and also do repair and fitting work should reserve 15%-50% of their capacity to accept repair and fitting tasks. The enterprises that are currently fully engaged in repair and fitting should remain roughly unchanged in the future and continue to undertake repair and fitting tasks. (2) According to needs, designate several enterprises to appropriately organize repair and fitting forces (such as workshops, teams) or set up comprehensive repair outlets or set up repair factories (such as Beijing) to accept the repair and fitting tasks of corresponding products. (3) The various measurement and identification institutions affiliated to the First Ministry of Machinery Industry, the Second Ministry of Machinery Industry, and the Ministry of Electrical Machinery Industry should undertake the calibration, performance identification, and some specialized repair and fitting tasks of scientific instruments in the area where they are located. (4) The repair and manufacturing departments affiliated to various scientific research institutions, universities and colleges, and large hospitals, in addition to repairing and manufacturing scientific instruments needed by their own units, should also accept the repair and fitting and some product manufacturing work entrusted by other institutions according to their professional expertise and strength. Advocate mutual support and exchange of research results between scientific research institutions. Encourage scientific and technical personnel who operate and use instruments to do their own repairs within their capabilities.
    III. Regarding the supply of scientific instruments: (1) The needs for scientific instruments raised by scientific research institutions and universities and colleges at local instrument and meter ordering balance meetings and production arrangements should be taken care of as a priority. For temporary orders and repair tasks that are not included in the plan, the requesting unit should be allowed to contact the enterprise directly and make every effort to support and resolve them. (2) Commercial departments should give priority to the needs of scientific research institutions and universities and colleges to the extent that they can supply. At the same time, the scope of small packaging and retail business should be expanded to meet the characteristics of sporadic needs. Regional restrictions should be lifted. (3) In order to effectively and timely solve the temporary, sporadic, or special needs of scientific research institutions and universities and colleges, it is decided to first organize pilot comprehensive service institutions in five major cities, Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Shenyang, and Guangzhou, to assist in solving the source of goods and repair and fitting problems for the instrument equipment and various experimental materials needed by scientific research institutions and universities and colleges. At the same time, it is necessary to make necessary reserves for some sporadic special commodities (materials, accessories and equipment) as needed in order to meet the needs of various scientific research work and repair and fitting in a timely manner.
  (4) The accumulated instruments and raw materials of scientific research institutions and universities and colleges can be adjusted among various departments to exchange what each has for what it needs. Excesses can be resold through the service office or the trust company of the commercial department. In order to encourage various units to deal with the enthusiasm of such equipment, the cash obtained after adjustment or sale will still belong to the original unit, but can only be used to purchase new instruments or materials needed for scientific research work. (5) For valuable instruments and important equipment, the method of jointly establishing laboratories by several units or borrowing from each other can be adopted; it can also be based on existing conditions with a certain unit as the center, and the method of borrowing or leasing can be adopted. After the conditions are ripe, preparations are being made to gradually establish joint experimental institutions in several central cities. 4. Regarding the import of foreign scientific instruments: (1) The relevant import companies should improve and simplify the procedures for importing scientific instruments and supply scientific instruments in a timely manner. (2) Various scientific research institutions and universities and colleges can set aside a small portion of the foreign exchange quota allocated by the state as a temporary order, and ask the relevant import company to place an order on their behalf or entrust experts to purchase a small amount of urgently needed instruments or accessories while traveling abroad. In view of the fact that some of the instruments in the order forms submitted by various units cannot be ordered, a preliminary order form can be submitted to the import company for arrangement in advance. (3) All departments and localities that produce domestic instruments should collect the samples and catalogs of scientific instruments produced and submit them to the Instrument and Meter Bureau of the First Ministry of Machinery Industry, which will bind them into a booklet for reference by various import companies, scientific research institutions, and universities and colleges when ordering scientific instruments, so as to avoid ordering varieties that can be produced domestically from abroad.
      Improvement plan for chemical reagents
    The plan for improving chemical reagents proposes that:
    I. Improving production and strengthening scientific research: (1) Unify planning and production, and arrange production bases. In the future, the national reagent industry should be led by the Ministry of Chemical Industry to uniformly arrange production. The national reagent factories are still managed by the localities. At present, Beijing and Shanghai have a better foundation for reagent production, have greater potential, and have more universities, colleges, and research institutions. Therefore, Beijing and Shanghai should be developed into comprehensive reagent production bases. Other existing reagent factories in Tianjin, Dalian, Shenyang, Chengdu, Harbin, and other places should give full play to their potential strength and appropriately develop on the existing basis. Some chemical plants in the inland areas should also produce some reagents as an attachment when needed. (2) Increase varieties and improve quality. In the next five years, the common reagents that are often produced domestically should be increased to 1,600 to 2,000 types to meet the regular needs of general research and experimental institutions, provided that the quality is guaranteed. (3) Strengthen the production of special reagents. The supply of special reagents other than 1,600 to 2,000 common reagents can be done in the following ways: (A) Special order workshops can be set up in reagent factories in Beijing, Shanghai, and other regions with conditions to specifically accept orders for special reagents;
  (B) New varieties that reagent factories themselves are not able to produce can be trial-produced in cooperation with relevant research institutions and universities, or trial-produced by research institutions and universities themselves. A unified registration system should be established for the production or trial production of special reagents; only reagents that cannot be produced domestically should be organized for import.
  (4) Enrich the central laboratory of the Beijing Reagent Factory and carry out research work on chemical reagents.
    II. Improving the supply work: (1) Formulate a supply catalog of general chemical reagents. The Ministry of Commerce, together with the Ministry of Chemical Industry, should summarize the domestic needs for chemical reagents in recent years and refer to international experience to formulate a supply catalog of 1,600 to 2,000 common chemical reagents. (2) Establish a national reserve system for chemical reagents. Chemical reagents are different from other industrial products. They require many varieties and small quantities, and it is impossible to organize production or import according to a strict production and sales plan; in order to ensure the uniformity of quality, it is also inappropriate to produce small quantities of products in batches. Therefore, in order to facilitate production and ensure supply, a certain amount of reserves is required. In addition to the commercial system filling up the regular reserves of common reagents, the working capital for production should also be appropriately increased, which will be used by various reagent factories to reserve a small amount of products; and establish a national reserve system for chemical reagents to solve the reserve problems of special varieties other than the 1,600 to 2,000 common reagents. (3) There are many varieties and complicated specifications of imported reagents, but they occupy less foreign exchange. The annual variety plan compiled in the previous year often cannot be well combined with the actual needs of the second year. Therefore, it is recommended that only the annual foreign exchange amount plan be made in the future. (4) Arrange the supply base network of national chemical reagents. In the pharmaceutical companies in nine cities, including Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Shenyang, Xi'an, Chongqing, Guangzhou, Wuhan, and Harbin, supply is based on the catalog of common reagents (1,600 to 2,000 types). The pharmaceutical companies in other cities take the domestic products in the catalog as the scope of business, but should handle the agency business for common reagents outside the scope of business. (5) The supply of special reagents. For varieties outside the supply catalog of common reagents (1,600 to 2,000 types), if they can be produced domestically, the grass-roots user departments (such as research institutes, universities, factories, hospitals, etc.) should directly contact the production units to place orders; special reagents that cannot be produced domestically but need to be imported should be supplied directly to various user units across the country by the Shanghai Chemical Reagent Store, which is strengthened by the Shanghai Municipal People's Committee in cooperation with the Ministry of Commerce. The Ministry of Foreign Trade should strengthen the import business of chemical reagents in Shanghai and simplify the current procedures to meet the requirements of the Shanghai Chemical Reagent Store and user departments. Relevant scientific research units and universities and colleges in Shanghai should give technical guidance; in order to reduce the practical difficulties in organizing the import of sporadic reagents, research institutions and universities can directly obtain sporadic reagents from abroad through international scientific and technological activities.

    国务院科学规划委员会
    制订改善科学工作条件的四个方案
    新华社9日电　国务院科学规划委员会为了改善科学研究工作的条件，制订了全国图书协调，改进档案资料工作，改进科学仪器的生产、修配和供应，以及改进化学试剂工作等四个方案。
    全国图书协调方案
    全国图书协调方案中提出：目前首先要建立中心图书馆；和编制全国图书联合目录。中心图书馆的任务是：（1）为科学研究工作服务；（2）搜集种类较多、质量较高的应该收藏的书刊；（3）编制联合书目和新书通报；（4）国际交换图书的工作（由一部分全国中心图书馆进行）；（5）照相复制图书工作，由一部分中心图书馆进行；（6）规划和进行干部培养工作。
    全国性的中心图书馆由北京（第一中心）和上海（第二中心）的若干最有基础的图书馆组成。北京图书馆应该成为全国图书馆的核心和图书馆业务的辅导中心。地区性的中心图书馆，暂时确定在武汉、沈阳、南京、广州、成都、西安、兰州、天津、哈尔滨等地，指定某些图书馆来担任。图书馆的名单，请各该省、市人民委员会考虑决定。以后视需要和可能，增加地区性中心图书馆的地点。
    全国性中心图书馆中的公共图书馆（如北京图书馆）、中国科学院图书馆和专业的科学图书馆（如医、农、地质图书馆）应该向全国科学工作者开放，高等学校附属的图书馆应该除了保证本校师生的需要外，并尽可能根据各该馆的专长特点，对有关的科学工作者开放
  （如北京师范大学图书馆对教育科学工作者开放），以补公共图书馆的不足。以后视需要和可能再陆续指定北京、上海或其他地区的专业图书馆成为中心图书馆。
    全国的和地区的中心图书馆既然是由若干图书馆共同组成的，为统一步调、加强协作，可由各图书馆的负责人组成中心图书馆委员会，他们的任务是：（1）协助科学规划（或工作）委员会或行政领导部门研究图书馆的统筹安排和全面规划；（2）研究和解决有关中心图书馆之间的分工合作，包括图书采购、调配、交换、互借等方面的业务问题；（3）研究有关编制联合书目、新书通报方面的问题。并制订计划；（4）研究有关干部业务提高的问题。
    在建立中心图书馆的同时，应该有计划地逐步进行过多的复本和不合理馆藏的调配工作。
    在全国中心图书馆委员会下成立一个全国图书联合目录编辑组，附设于北京图书馆内。它的任务是：（1）了解、调查全国各图书馆藏书和编目情况；（2）制订联合目录编辑计划；（3）起草联合目录编目条例；
  （4）加强和各馆有关联合目录工作的联系，布置、检查和督促工作；（5）综合各馆书目，作最后的编排、校订、出版等工作。参加编制联合目录的单位，以中国科学院和其所属各研究所图书馆，各高等院校图书馆，各省级以上的公共图书馆和专业图书馆为基础，根据题目的不同，选择参加编制的单位。目前正在或计划编辑的专题联合目录有中国革命史联合目录等六种。从1957年7月起开始编辑的有西文期刊联合目录等九种，要求在1959年底完成。
      改进档案资料工作方案
    改进档案、资料工作的方案中提出：
    一、必须建立统一的档案、资料工作的管理制度，加强对档案、资料的整理、保管和组织利用等工作。国家档案局是国家掌管档案资料工作的机构。国家档案局对建立国家档案馆和各个专业的档案馆、资料馆的工作应该进行督促和检查。目前除档案馆已另有计划外，可以由国家技术委员会、国家建设委员会、地质部、农业部和国家统计局分别对工业交通、基本建设、地质、农业、经济等方面着手建立统一的资料管理工作。
    二）关于利用和交流资料的几点办法：（1）某些部门可以考虑印行定期的或不定期的资料性刊物。（2）国家档案局应该对各部门现有档案资料情况进行了解，并经常组织交流情况。（3）现有资料经整理后，凡属于可以公开而需要量又较大的，可以公开出版。可以编印年鉴和资料汇编。有些资料可作为内部资料印发。（4）各部的档案资料管理机构有条件时可设立阅览室，订立借阅制度。（5）有关机关、企业和学校、科学研究机构之间可以经过订立合同等办法加强联系，交换资料。要做到供应资料单位能主动提供资料，而需要资料的单位又能避免过多地重复地要求资料。
    三、为了解决资料供应工作中保密方面所存在的问题，提出以下几点办法：（1）在一个机关、企业、学校和研究机构内，本单位的工作人员，可以借阅在他的工作范围内所需要的资料。实习人员在借阅资料时一般可以享有所在实习单位同类工作人员的同等待遇，但借阅某些机密资料应该按照本单位规定的制度经过批准。
  （2）凡属在生产上、教学上和科学研究工作上性质相同的或相近的单位之间，除有特殊规定外，可以互相供应必要的资料。供应资料单位可以把需要一般资料的主要单位（例如学校、研究机构）固定起来作为等同于自己系统的一个单位那样，主动地提供一般的资料。（3）各部门之间借阅机密资料，借阅资料人员可由所在单位负责介绍。批准手续应该适当改进，以利工作。（4）凡是在外国已经公开的资料，以及外国人在解放前在中国所做的调查、勘察、测绘资料或其他资料，只要工作需要，有关人员都可借阅。（5）凡是机关、企业、学校、研究机构工作人员自己所调查、研究、设计、绘制的资料，在缴给资料管理部门以后，本人随时可以借阅。
  （6）除上述几点外，各部门还可以根据本单位具体情况规定资料供应的办法。（7）借阅资料的人员概由派出单位负责审查，接待单位一般不再审查，但如发现有问题也可提出意见。（8）借阅资料的人员，对机密资料应该按照供应资料单位的保密要求负有保密的完全责任。改进科学仪器的生产修配和供应方案
    改进科学仪器生产、修配和供应的方案中提出：
    一、关于科学仪器的生产：（1）各仪器生产部门除增加现有品种的产量和提高质量以满足需要外，同时应该大力发展新品种。过去已经生产的品种，只要是社会上仍有需要，都应该继续生产，不得减少品种。同时应该采取措施使各生产部门有可能并且愿意承担小量的、特殊的仪器的生产，以保证科学研究工作的特殊需要。（2）为了便于各工业部门有计划地安排生产和新品种的试制工作，更好地满足对科学仪器的需要，中国科学院、高等教育部和其他使用部门应该组织有关机构和科学家尽可能地提供本年度和第二个五年计划期间所需要的仪器品种和数量，交国家技术委员会会同有关部门安排试制和生产。为了解决目前科学仪器生产上所需要的特殊材料，各部门凡是具有能生产特殊材料的工厂、研究机构，都应该尽量扩大生产，供应各方面需要。同时应该有计划地进口特殊材料，以便扩大国内科学仪器的生产，相应减少仪器的进口。（3）国家技术委员会应该会同各有关部门迅速建立仪器仪表的鉴定工作。（4）为了迅速发展科学仪器工业，各仪器生产企业应该加强同科学研究机构、高等学校和科学家的联系，争取他们在技术上、业务上的指导和援助。各科学研究机构和高等学校也应该积极地把自己的研究成果向有关企业推广，并提出改进仪器生产的建议。同时，科学研究机构和高等学校的附属工厂和车间，可以生产较专门的仪器，或协助企业制造某些特殊配件，以利仪器工业的发展。
    二、关于科学仪器的修配：原则上规定：国内产品谁制造谁修理，并且应该接受同一地区同类型产品的修理工作；国外进口仪器的修配工作按地区组织相关的企业承担，大体上按产品分工，以扩大修配力量。（1）一般仪表生产企业都应该接受相应产品的修配工作，可以在年度计划中留1％—5％的能力，接受修配任务。生产并兼做修配工作的企业应该留15％—50％能力，接受修配任务。现在完全从事修配的企业，今后应该大体不变，继续承担修配任务。（2）根据需要，指定若干企业适当组织修配力量（如工段、小组）或设立综合性的修理门市部或设立修理工厂（如北京），以接受相应产品的修配任务。（3）第一机械工业部、第二机械工业部、电机制造工业部所属的各计量鉴定机构，应该承担所在地区科学仪器的校正、性能鉴定和某些专门的修配任务。（4）各科学研究机构、高等学校、大医院所附属的修理制造部门，除修理制造本单位所需要的科学仪器外，根据它的专业特长和力量大小，亦应接受其他机构所委托的修配和某些产品制造的工作。提倡科学研究机构之间互相支援，交流研究成果。鼓励操纵使用仪器的科学技术人员，亲自动手进行自己能力范围内的修理。
    三）关于科学仪器的供应：（1）在各地仪器仪表的订货平衡会议上和生产安排上对科学研究机关、高等学校所提出的有关科学仪器的需要应该尽先照顾。未列入计划的临时订货和修理任务，应该允许需要单位直接同企业联系，并尽力支持给予解决。（2）商业部门在可能供应的范围内应该做到尽先供应科学研究机构和高等学校的需要。同时应该扩大小包装范围和经营零售业务，以适应零星需要的特点。地区限制应该取消。（3）为了切实而及时地解决科学研究机构和高等学校临时的、零星的或特殊的需要，决定首先在北京、上海、天津、沈阳和广州五大城市组织试办综合性服务机构，协助解决科学研究机构和高等学校所需要的仪器设备和各种试验材料的货源问题和修配问题。同时视需要可以对一些零星的特殊商品（材料、配件和设备）做必要的储备，以便及时满足各项科学研究工作和修配上的需要。
  （4）科学研究机构和高等学校积压的仪器和原材料，可以在各部门之间互相调剂，互通有无。调剂多下来的可以通过服务处或商业部门的信托公司转卖。为了鼓励各单位处理此类器材的积极性，调剂或出卖后所得的现款，仍归原单位所有，但只能用于购买科学研究工作上所需要的新的仪器或材料。（5）凡贵重仪器和重要设备，可以采取由几个单位联合设实验室，或互相借用的办法；也可以根据现有的条件以某一单位为中心，采取借用或租用的办法。待条件成熟后，准备逐渐在几个中心城市建立联合试验机构。　　四、关于国外科学仪器的进口：（1）各有关进口公司应该改进和简化科学仪器进口的手续，及时供应科学仪器。（2）各科学研究机关和高等学校可在国家分配的外汇额内留出一少部分作为临时订货，请有关进口公司代订或委托专家趁出国之便，购买少量急需的仪器或配件。鉴于各单位所提的订货单中，有些仪器订不到，因此可以预先提出预备订货单交进口公司安排。（3）国内生产仪器的各部门、各地方应该将所生产的科学仪器样本和目录，汇交第一机械工业部仪器仪表局，由该局装订成册，供各进口公司、科学研究机构、高等学校订购科学仪器时的参考，以免国内能够生产的品种，仍向国外订购。
      改进化学试剂工作方案
    改进化学试剂工作方案中提出：
    一、改进生产和加强科学研究工作：（1）统一规划生产，布置生产基地。今后全国的试剂工业应该由化学工业部负责领导，统一安排生产。全国的各试剂生产厂仍由地方管理。目前，北京、上海两地试剂生产的基础较好，有较大潜力并有较多的高等学校和研究机关，因此，北京、上海宜发展成为综合性的试剂生产基地。其他如天津、大连、沈阳、成都、哈尔滨等地的现有试剂厂，应该充分发挥其潜在力量，在现有基础上，适当发展。内地一些化工厂，在需要的情况下也应该附带生产一些试剂。（2）增加品种，改进质量。今后五年内，应该在保证质量的条件下，将国内经常生产的通用试剂增加到一千六百——二千种，以满足一般研究试验机构的经常需要。（3）加强特殊试剂的生产。一千六百——二千种通用试剂以外的特殊试剂的供应，可以采取以下几个办法：（甲）在北京、上海和其他地区有条件的试剂厂设立特殊订货车间，专门接受特殊试剂的订货；
  （乙）试剂厂本身无条件生产的新品种，可以同有关研究机构和高等学校合作试制，或由研究机构、高等学校自行试制。对特殊试剂的生产或试制，应该建立统一登记制度；只有国内不能生产的试剂，才组织国外进口。
  （4）充实北京试剂厂的中央试验室，开展化学试剂的研究工作。
    二、改进供应工作方面：（1）拟定通用化学试剂的供应目录。由商业部会同化学工业部总结国内近年来对化学试剂的需要情况，并参照国际经验拟出一千六百——二千种通用化学试剂的供应目录。（2）建立化学试剂的国家储备制度。化学试剂和其他工业品不同，它需要的品种多、数量少，不可能按照严格的产销计划来组织生产或进口；为了保证质量的均一性，小量产品分批生产也是不合适的。因此，为了便利生产和保证供应，需要有一定的储备。除商业系统应该充实通用试剂的经常储备外，还应该适当增加生产的流动资金，由各试剂厂用以储备少量产品；和建立化学试剂的国家储备制度，用以解决一千六百——二千种通用试剂以外的特殊品种的储备问题。（3）进口试剂品种很多、规格复杂，但占用外汇较少，前一年编制的年度品种计划同第二年的实际需要常常不能很好结合。因此，建议今后只作年度的外汇金额计划。（4）布置全国化学试剂的供应基点网。在北京、上海、天津、沈阳、西安、重庆、广州、武汉、哈尔滨等九个城市的医药公司，按通用试剂（一千六百——二千种）目录供应。其他城市的医药公司，以目录中的国产品种为经营范围，但对经营范围外的通用试剂，应该办理代理业务。（5）特殊试剂的供应。在通用试剂（一千六百——二千种）供应目录以外的品种，国内能生产的，由基层用货部门（如研究所、高等学校、工厂、医院等）向生产单位直接联系订货；国内不能生产而需要进口的特殊试剂，由上海市人民委员会配合商业部加强现有的上海化学试剂商店，对全国各用货单位直接办理供应业务。对外贸易部应该加强上海的化学试剂进口业务，简化现行手续，以满足上海化学试剂商店和用货部门的要求。上海有关的科学研究单位和高等学校应该给以技术指导；为了减轻组织零星试剂进口的实际困难，研究机构和高等学校可以通过国际科学技术活动，从国外直接取得零星试剂。
