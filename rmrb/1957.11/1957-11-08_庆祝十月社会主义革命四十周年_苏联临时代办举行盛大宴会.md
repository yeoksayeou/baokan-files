Xinhua News Agency, 7th November.

To celebrate the 40th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution, the most glorious festival for working people all over the world, Gu Tikov, Chargé d'Affaires of the Soviet Embassy in China, held a grand celebration banquet in the evening.

Vice Chairman Zhu De, Chairman Liu Shaoqi, Premier Zhou Enlai, and Andrei Andreyevich, head of the Soviet delegation representing all sectors of Soviet society to participate in the Chinese people's celebration of the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution, attended the banquet.

The banquet, attended by over a thousand Chinese and foreign guests, was held in the central hall of the Soviet Exhibition Center. Thousands of electric lights illuminated the spacious and tall arched hall as if it were daytime, making it a rare grand banquet in Beijing. In the center of the hall, above a flowerbed composed of various colorful flowers, hung a giant portrait of Lenin, the mentor of the proletarian revolution. On both sides were alternately placed ten Soviet and Chinese national flags, as well as banners written in Russian and Chinese: "Long Live the 40th Anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution!" A huge red banner with golden characters across the hall read: "Long Live the Unbreakable Friendship and Cooperation Between the Soviet and Chinese People—the Powerful Pillar of World Peace!"

As the banquet began, the band played the national anthems of the Soviet Union and China.

Chargé d'Affaires Gu Tikov spoke first. He pointed out that the victory of the Great October Revolution victoriously marked the beginning of a new era, the era of the establishment of socialism.

Gu Tikov said that although the Soviet regime had suffered many serious tests in forty years, including foreign armed intervention, "each time, the socialist system has shown the world its great vitality and the unbreakable unity of the Communist Party and the Soviet people."

Gu Tikov then pointed out that the victory of the Chinese People's Revolution was the most outstanding event in world history after the October Revolution. He emphasized in his speech: "The great friendship and unbreakable alliance between our two peoples are a reliable guarantee for our two countries to achieve further successes in the construction of socialism and communism, and a strong pillar of peace and international security."

Vice Chairman Zhu De first extended the most sincere and warm congratulations on behalf of the Chinese people, the Chinese government, and the Chinese Communist Party to the glorious Soviet people, the Soviet government, and the Soviet Communist Party. He said that the Great October Revolution opened a new era in human history, illuminating the path to liberation for all exploited classes and oppressed nations. Now, nearly one billion people in Asia and Europe have embarked on the broad road of socialism and formed a powerful socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. Socialism has become an invincible world system.

Vice Chairman Zhu De warmly congratulated the Soviet people on the brilliant achievements they have made in socialist and communist construction under the leadership of the glorious Soviet Communist Party and the Soviet government over the past forty years. He highly praised the great Soviet Union's consistent peaceful foreign policy in international affairs and the great role the Soviet Union has played in easing international tensions and safeguarding world peace.

Vice Chairman Zhu De emphasized: "The experience of the Soviet Union is the rich property of all other socialist countries and working people all over the world. The Soviet Union has consistently spared no effort to give great and generous assistance to other fraternal countries. This assistance is based on the principle of proletarian internationalism and equal mutual assistance. Facts have proved that this mutual assistance and cooperation between socialist countries is the most reliable guarantee for the prosperity and strength of the socialist family."

Vice Chairman Zhu De reiterated that the Chinese revolution is a continuation of the October Revolution and pointed out that the Chinese people have always regarded this as a great honor. He also expressed, on behalf of the Chinese government and people, heartfelt thanks to the Soviet people and the Soviet government for their consistent sympathy and support for the Chinese people's revolutionary struggle, and for the comprehensive and enormous assistance they have given to China's socialist construction.

Vice Chairman Zhu said in conclusion: "The unity and cooperation of more than 800 million people in China and the Soviet Union not only conforms to the greatest interests of our two peoples, but also is an important guarantee for world peace and human progress. The Chinese people will continue to do everything in their power to consolidate and develop friendship with the Soviet people, and to strengthen the great unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union."

Head of the delegation Andreyev said in his speech that "from the October Revolution to now is a relatively short period, but in this period, the Soviet people have fundamentally transformed their country, turning a backward, culturally underdeveloped, and poor Russia into a powerful socialist country."

Head of the delegation Andreyev also said that one-third of the world's population has embarked on the socialist road opened up by the October Revolution, and millions of people have been freed from the colonial enslavement of imperialism and embarked on the road of independent development. These are the most important achievements of the cause created by the Great October Revolution forty years ago.

Andreyev said that the Soviet people are particularly pleased that the great Chinese people have made outstanding achievements in establishing their own socialist industry and transportation, in the socialist transformation of the countryside, and in achieving a true cultural revolution. They heartily congratulate the Chinese people on achieving the most outstanding achievements in the great cause of building socialism.

Andreyev then rebuked the imperialists for attempting to undermine the unity of socialist countries, undermine world peace, and attempt to re-enslave the people of Asia and Africa. He pointed out: "Since imperialism was unable to defeat the Soviet Union in the past thirty years, then now they are even weaker in the face of the powerful camp of socialist countries and the people of Asian and African countries who have won independence."

Andreyev concluded by saying: "The extremely great achievements of socialist construction in thirteen socialist countries, especially the extremely great achievements of socialist construction of the two major nations of the Soviet Union and China, cannot be erased no matter how hard our enemies try."

The grand banquet was filled with festive joy and fraternal friendship. Chairman Liu Shaoqi proposed a toast to the Soviet Communist Party and its Central Committee, which opened a new era in the history of all mankind, to the creator of the world's first socialist country, to the organizer and leader of the victory of the Great October Socialist Revolution, and enriched Marxism-Leninism with its long-tested experience in struggle, for greater achievements in future endeavors. Premier Zhou Enlai proposed a toast to the unbreakable and eternal friendship between the great Soviet people and the Chinese people. Polish Ambassador Kirilok, as the head of the diplomatic corps, congratulated the great October Socialist Revolution's 40th anniversary on behalf of the heads of missions in China. During the banquet, guests frequently toasted the great unity of the socialist family headed by the Soviet Union, the great victory of Marxism-Leninism, and the health of the parties, governments, and leaders of the parties and governments of China and the Soviet Union.

After the grand banquet, the guests enjoyed a brilliant performance by the artists of the ballet troupe of the Novosibirsk State Opera and Ballet Theatre of the Soviet Union. After the performance, the Chinese guests presented flower baskets to the Soviet artists. Zhu De, Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai and others, accompanied by Chargé d'Affaires Gu Tikov, delegation leader Andreyev, and others, went on stage, shook hands with the Soviet actors one by one, and took a group photo.

Also present at the banquet were Vice Chairmen Lin Boqu, Li Jishen, Luo Ronghuan, Shen Junru, Huang Yanpei, Peng Zhen, and Chen Shutong; Vice Premiers Chen Yun, He Long, Chen Yi, Li Fuchun, and Nie Rongzhen; Vice Chairmen of the National Defense Council Zhang Zhizhong and Fu Zuoyi; Procurator-General of the Supreme People's Procuratorate Zhang Dingcheng; Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhang Wentian; Vice Chairmen of the National Committee of the CPPCC He Xiangning and Bao Erhan; Vice Chairman of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Wu Yuzhang; as well as responsible persons from various departments of state organs, various departments of the CPC Central Committee, various democratic parties, and various people's organizations, senior generals of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and well-known figures from all walks of life in the capital.

    庆祝十月社会主义革命四十周年
    苏联临时代办举行盛大宴会
    新华社7日讯　在全世界劳动人民最光辉的节日——伟大十月社会主义革命四十周年的晚间，苏联驻中国大使馆临时代办顾悌克夫举行了盛大的庆祝宴会。
    朱德副主席、刘少奇委员长、周恩来总理和苏联各界参加中国人民庆祝十月革命四十周年纪念代表团团长安德烈耶夫等都出席了宴会。
    有一千几百名中外人士参加的宴会在苏联展览馆的中央大厅举行，成千盏电灯把这座宽敞高大的拱形大厅照耀得如同白昼，这是北京罕见的一次盛宴。在大厅正中由各色鲜花组成的花坛上方，悬挂着无产阶级革命导师列宁的巨像，两旁交替地插着十面苏中两国国旗，还有用俄中文书写的标语：“伟大的十月社会主义革命四十周年万岁！”迎面横贯大厅的一幅巨幅红底金字标语上写着：“世界和平的强大支柱——苏中两国人民的牢不可破的友谊和合作万岁！”
    宴会开始，乐队奏苏中两国国歌。
    顾悌克夫临时代办首先讲话。他指出，伟大的十月革命胜利地标志出一个新的时代即社会主义确立的时代的开始。
    顾悌克夫说，苏维埃政权虽然在四十年里曾经遭受到包括外国武装干涉在内的许多严重考验，“但是，每一次社会主义制度都向全世界显示了它的伟大的生命力、共产党和苏联人民的牢不可破的团结。”
    顾悌克夫接着指出中国人民革命的胜利是十月革命后世界历史事件中最卓越的事件，他并在讲话的最后强调指出：“我们两国人民的伟大友谊和牢不可破的同盟是我们两国在社会主义和共产主义的建设事业中获得进一步成就的可靠保证，是和平和国际安全的有力支柱。”
    朱德副主席在讲话中首先代表中国人民、中国政府和中国共产党向光荣的苏联人民、苏联政府和苏联共产党致以最诚挚和最热烈的祝贺。他说，伟大的十月革命开辟了人类历史的新纪元，照亮了一切被剥削阶级和被压迫民族走向解放的道路。现在，欧亚两洲近十亿人民已经走上了社会主义的康庄大道，并且组成了以苏联为首的强大的社会主义阵营。社会主义已经成为不可战胜的世界体系。
    朱德副主席热烈祝贺四十年来苏联人民在光荣的苏联共产党和苏联政府领导下在社会主义和共产主义建设中所取得的辉煌成就，他高度地赞誉伟大的苏联在国际间一贯奉行的和平外交政策，以及苏联在缓和国际紧张局势和保卫世界和平中所起的巨大作用。
    朱德副主席强调说：“苏联的经验是所有其他社会主义国家和全世界劳动人民的丰富的财产。苏联一贯不遗余力地给予其他兄弟国家巨大的慷慨的援助。这种援助是建筑在无产阶级国际主义和平等互助的原则之上的。事实证明，社会主义各国之间的这种互助合作是社会主义大家庭繁荣和强大的最可靠的保证。”
    朱德副主席再次强调中国革命是十月革命的继续，并且指出中国人民一向把这一点看做是莫大的光荣。他还代表中国政府和人民，对苏联人民一贯同情和支持中国人民的革命斗争，以及对中国社会主义建设事业所给予的全面的巨大的援助，向苏联人民和苏联政府表示衷心地感谢。
    朱副主席最后说：“中苏两国八亿以上人民的团结合作，不仅符合我们两国人民的最大利益，同时也是世界和平和人类进步事业的重要保证。中国人民将继续用全力来巩固和发展同苏联人民的友谊，并且加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的伟大团结。”
    安德烈耶夫团长在接着讲话中说：“由十月革命到现在是一个比较短的时期，但是，在这个时期中，苏联人民已经从根本上改造了自己的国家，把一个落后的、文化不发达的、贫穷的俄国变成为强大的社会主义国家。”
    安德烈耶夫团长还说，地球上三分之一的人口已经走上了十月革命所开辟的社会主义道路，千百万人民已经摆脱了帝国主义者的殖民奴役，并且走上了独立发展的道路，这些都是伟大的十月革命在四十年前所开创的事业的最重要的成果。
    安德烈耶夫说，苏联人民特别感到高兴的是伟大的中国人民在建立自己的社会主义工业和运输业方面，在农村的社会主义改造和实现真正的文化革命方面，都取得了卓越的成就，他们衷心地祝贺中国人民在建设社会主义的伟大事业中取得最优异的成就。
    安德烈耶夫接着斥责了帝国主义者企图破坏社会主义各国的团结，破坏世界和平和企图重新奴役亚非国家人民的阴谋。他指出：“既然在过去三十年的时间内，帝国主义没有能力战胜一个苏联，那末现在他们在社会主义国家的强大阵营和赢得了独立的亚非各国人民面前则是更加软弱无力了。”
    安德烈耶夫最后说：“十三个社会主义国家的社会主义建设的极其伟大的成就，特别是苏中两大民族的社会主义建设的极其伟大的成就，无论我们的敌人怎样费尽心机也是抹煞不了的。”
    盛大的宴会充满节日的欢乐和兄弟情谊。刘少奇委员长提议，为为整个人类历史开辟了新纪元、为世界第一个社会主义国家的缔造者，为伟大的十月社会主义革命胜利的组织者和领导者，以自己久经锻炼的斗争经验丰富了马克思列宁主义的苏联共产党和它的中央委员会，在未来的事业中获得更大的成就干杯。周恩来总理提议，为伟大的苏联人民和中国人民牢不可破的永恒的友谊干杯。波兰大使基里洛克以使团团长的身分代表各国驻中国的使节祝贺伟大的十月社会主义革命四十周年的节日。席间，宾主还频频为以苏联为首的社会主义各国大家庭的伟大团结，为马克思列宁主义的伟大胜利，为中苏两国的党、政府和两国党和政府的领导人的健康，干杯。
    盛大的宴会结束以后，宾主一起欣赏了苏联国立新西伯利亚歌舞剧院芭蕾舞团艺术家们的精采表演。演出结束后，中国客人给苏联艺术家们赠送了花篮。朱德、刘少奇、周恩来等由顾悌克夫临时代办和安德烈耶夫团长等陪同走上舞台，同苏联演员们一一握手，合影留念。
