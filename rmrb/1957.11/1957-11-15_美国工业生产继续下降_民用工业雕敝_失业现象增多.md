Xinhua News Agency, New York, November 14th: The downward trend in US industrial activity that began in the spring of this year is continuing to expand.

The Associated Press said in a report on the 13th: "More and more parts of the economy are joining the current reduction." This is reflected in the indices of the steel and oil industries, in the reduced production and weak prices of textile products, in the employment situation in factories, and has even begun to affect the prospects of employment for company staff.

The steel production in the week ending November 9 was lower than at any time since the steelworkers' strike affected it in early August 1956, with only 78% of production capacity in operation.

The oil industry is also facing a difficult year. Current production has far exceeded consumption, leading to a fall in the price of oil products.

The excessive difficulties of the textile industry have caused the prices of some types of products to weaken again. In order to reduce growing inventories, some larger textile companies are planning to shut down for eight days between Thanksgiving holiday (November 28) and Christmas holiday.

Now, apart from manufacturing military supplies, many manufacturers of civilian goods are finding that they must reduce production if they do not want their inventories to increase.

The "U.S. News & World Report" magazine admitted in a recent issue that unemployment is increasing in all regions of the United States. Industries such as aviation, electrical machinery, textiles, shipbuilding, lumber processing, and construction are laying off workers. By the end of this year, aircraft factories will lay off more than 100,000 workers, and factories producing aircraft parts will lay off 50,000 workers.

The number of unemployed in Washington State will exceed 100,000 by the end of the year. According to official sources in Oregon, the number of layoffs in October broke all records in the postwar era. Ford Motor Company laid off 2,000 workers from its Chicago factory, and "Caterpillar Tractor Company" also claimed that it would lay off 4,200 workers in its factories in Peoria, Joliet, Decatur (Illinois) and other cities.

### 美国工业生产继续下降  民用工业雕敝　失业现象增多

    美国工业生产继续下降
    民用工业雕敝　失业现象增多
    新华社14日讯　纽约消息：从今年春季开始的美国工业活动的下降趋势，目前正在继续扩大。
    美联社在13日的消息里说：“经济中每月都有更多的部分加入目前这种减缩的行列”。这表现在钢铁和石油工业的指数上，表现在纺织产品的减产和价格的疲软上，表现在工厂的就业情况上，并且甚至已经开始影响到公司职员就业的前景。
    到本月9日为止的一周，钢的生产比它在1956年8月初受到钢铁工人大罢工影响以来的任何时候都要低，只有78％的生产能力在开工。
    石油工业也面临一个困难的年份。目前生产已经大大超出了消费量，以致石油产品价格下跌。
    纺织工业过多的困难已经造成某些种类产品价格再次出现疲软。为了压低不断增长的存货，有些较大的纺织公司正计划在感恩节假期（11月28日）到圣诞节假期之间停工八天。
    现在，除了制造军用物资以外，许多民用物品制造商们发现，如果他们不愿他们的存货增加，他们必须减少生产。
      “美国新闻与世界报道”杂志在最近一期中承认，在美国所有地区失业现象在增多。航空、电机、纺织、造船、木材加工和建筑等工业部门都在解雇工人。到今年年底各飞机工厂将解雇十万多工人，而生产飞机部件的工厂将解雇五万工人。
    华盛顿州到年底失业人数将超过十万。据俄勒冈州的官方消息说，10月的解雇数字打破了战后年代的所有纪录。福特汽车公司从它的芝加哥工厂解雇了两千工人，“履带拖拉机公司”也声称在它的彼俄利阿、卓莱特、迪卡特（伊利诺斯州）等市的工厂中将解雇四千二百工人。
