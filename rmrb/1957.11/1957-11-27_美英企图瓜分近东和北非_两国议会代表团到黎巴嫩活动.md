　　Xinhua News Agency, Beirut, 25th: TASS reports that the American and British parliamentary delegations currently visiting the Near East and North Africa have arrived in Lebanon.

　　Lebanon’s “Al-Khabar” newspaper says that the purpose of these delegations' visits is to alleviate Anglo-American contradictions by sacrificing the interests of the peoples of the region.

　　The newspaper pointed out that the dispatch of these two delegations was decided at the Eisenhower-Macmillan meeting in Washington. At that meeting, Eisenhower and Macmillan agreed to accomplish the following tasks: to promote a reconciliation between Arab countries and Israel that would benefit imperialist monopoly capital; to eliminate French influence in the Arab East and North Africa; to divide the region into spheres of influence for the United States and Britain; to take joint measures to deal with the development of the national liberation movement in the region; and to study the issue of absorbing Arab countries into Western blocs.
