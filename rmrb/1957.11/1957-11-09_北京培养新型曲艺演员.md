To cultivate a second generation of Quyi artists, the Beijing Quyi Federation recently established a Quyi training class. The twenty-four students enrolled all have a junior high school or elementary school education, and are divided into Jingyun, Meihua, Danxian, and Music sections, with a study period of three to four years. Hou Baolin and Gao Fengshan serve as the director and deputy director of the training class, respectively, and famous veteran artists and actors are responsible for teaching. Classes are held six days a week, with professional studies in the morning and political and cultural studies in the afternoon. At present, the various preparatory works are roughly ready, and formal teaching will begin in mid-month. After graduation, these students will be new types of actors with both political awareness and cultural knowledge. (Huan)
