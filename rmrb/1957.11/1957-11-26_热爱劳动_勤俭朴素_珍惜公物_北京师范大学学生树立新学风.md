Love Labor, Practice Thrift, Cherish Public Property
Beijing Normal University Students Establish a New Study Style

    (Our Newspaper) Beijing Normal University students are actively taking action, brainstorming ideas, and working together to assist the Party in implementing the policy of running the school through diligence and thrift. Currently, a spirit of labor, frugality, and care for public property has taken shape among the students.
    With great enthusiasm, students participate in physical labor in their spare time. In the six weeks since the start of the semester, more than 1,600 students have participated in voluntary labor such as road repair and tree planting on campus, reaching over 12,600 work hours, equivalent to 1,580 labor days. More than 3,400 students have gone to the countryside to labor, reaching over 12,300 work hours, equivalent to 1,570 labor days. Third-year students from the Biology Department used Sundays to renovate the small road between the North Campus playground and the sanatorium area into a cambered cinder path. Second and third-year students from the Physics Department participated in voluntary labor to build roads on the new campus. Fourth-year students from the Biology Department and second-year students from the Geography Department also wielded picks and shovels to loosen the soil in the vegetable garden of the Biology Garden.
    The students are determined to use their own hands to make the school environment clean and comfortable. Second-year students from the Chemistry Department carried out a thorough cleaning of the library and reading room, wiping more than 40 tables and 400 chairs until they shone, sweeping the floors clean, making the windows exceptionally bright, and arranging books and magazines neatly. Second-year students from the Biology Department cleaned 22 cabinets and more than 200 pieces of glass in the animal specimen room very thoroughly. Third-year students from the Geography Department scrubbed 34 cupboard and 204 curtains very cleanly. Other students participated in voluntary labor to clean classrooms, dormitories, and bathrooms. Some students also helped workers transport firewood and wash sweet potatoes.
    The students are responding to the call of the Communist Youth League Committee and the Student Union to conserve water, electricity, coal, grain, cloth, and cherish public property with practical actions, and have waged a struggle against the careless attitude and wastefulness towards public property. Students concentrate in classrooms for self-study in the evenings, reducing electricity consumption. They do not leave leftover food or steamed buns when eating, paying attention to cherishing every grain. Four third-year students from the Geography Department ran through twelve buildings and discovered that 79 faucets and 32 water tanks were leaking. They informed the General Affairs Department, which carried out repairs in a timely manner. Second-year students from the Chemistry Department collected discarded medicines, test tube racks, damaged books, instruments, sports equipment, and thousands of copies of lecture notes that had been overprinted, and held an anti-waste exhibition. When students saw the usable test tube racks that had been carelessly discarded piled up in a large basket, the new volleyballs kicked and broken by students, the torn gymnastics mats, etc., they were shocked. Third-year students from the Chemistry Department checked the public reference books, magazines, and wall charts they had taken from the library, totaling 156 items, most of which had been accumulating for about a year. One unique wall chart had been "lost" for a year, and this time it was also found.
    The mass movement of running Beijing Normal University with diligence and thrift is rapidly sweeping away bad habits in the school. Through this movement, the socialist study style of diligence, simplicity, collectivism, and love of labor will be further promoted among the students.

    热爱劳动　勤俭朴素　珍惜公物
    北京师范大学学生树立新学风
    本报讯　北京师范大学广大学生正在积极行动起来，想办法，齐动手，协助党贯彻勤俭办校的方针。目前学生中劳动、节约、爱护公共财物已经形成了风气。
    学生们以极大的热情在课余参加体力劳动，开学六周以来，有一千六百多人参加了校内修路、植树等义务劳动，达到一万二千六百多工时，可折合一千五百八十个劳动日，有三千四百多人下乡劳动，达到一万二千三百多工时，可折合一千五百七十个劳动日。生物系三年级学生利用星期日把北校操场和疗养区夹道的小路翻修成了弓背煤渣路，物理系二、三年级学生参加了新校修路的义务劳动，生物系四年级和地理系二年级学生还抡起铁镐、铁铣来到生物园把菜地翻松。
    学生们决心用自己的双手把学校环境搞得又整洁又舒适，化学系二年级在图书馆、阅览室进行了一次大扫除，把四十多张桌子、四百多把椅子擦得发亮，地面扫得干干净净，玻璃窗变得格外明亮，书报杂志摆得整整齐齐。生物系二年级学生把动物标本室二十二个柜子、二百多块玻璃擦得很干净，地理系三年级学生把北饭厅三十四张碗橱、二百零四条碗橱布帘擦洗得十分整洁。其他学生参加了打扫教室、宿舍、浴室的义务劳动，还有些学生帮助工友运木柴，洗白薯。
    广大学生用实际行动响应团委会和学生会节约水、电、煤、粮、布和爱护公共财物的号召，向对待公共财物漫不经心的态度和浪费现象进行了斗争。同学们晚上集中到教室上自习，减少了用电，吃饭时不留剩饭、剩馒头，注意珍惜每一颗粮食。地理系三年级有四个学生跑遍了十二座大楼，发现有七十九个水龙头和三十二个水箱漏水，他们告诉总务科，及时进行了修理。化学系二年级学生收集被遗弃的药品、试管架，被损坏的图书、仪器、体育用品和多印的成千份讲义，举办了一个反浪费展览会，当同学们看到被大家漫不经心遗弃的可用的试管架堆满了一大筐，被同学踢破的新排球、拖坏的体操垫子等等时，都感到触目惊心。化学系三年级学生清查了自己从图书馆拿走的公用参考书、杂志和挂图，共一百五十六件，一般都积压了一年左右，其中有张全校独一无二的挂图，已经“遗失”一年了，这次也清查了出来。
    北京师范大学勤俭办校的群众运动正在迅速扫除着学校里的坏习气，经过这次运动，广大学生中勤俭、朴素、集体主义、热爱劳动的社会主义学风将更加发扬起来。
