Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 2nd. Former French Prime Minister Edgar Faure has once again requested that the French government change its policy towards China. He demanded that the government publicly declare the establishment of diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China and begin negotiations for the establishment of diplomatic relations.

Faure's suggestion was made in a recently published book he wrote after visiting China, the title of which is taken from two mountains in China—"Snake Mountain" and "Turtle Mountain." These two mountains are separated by the Yangtze River and have been isolated from each other since ancient times, but now a bridge has been built between the two mountains. Faure believes that it is possible to build a bridge between East and West in the same way.

Faure said that France has no reason to pursue a "two Chinas" policy.

    法国前总理富尔
    要求政府同我国建交
    新华社2日讯　巴黎消息：法国前总理埃加·富尔再一次要求法国政府改变对中国的政策。他要求政府公开声明同中华人民共和国建立外交关系，并且开始进行建交谈判。
    富尔的建议是在他新近出版的访问中国后所写的一本书中提出的，这本书的书名取自中国的两座山——“蛇山”和“龟山”。这两座山当中隔着长江，自古以来就是互相隔绝的，但是现在两山之间已经架起桥梁了。富尔认为东方和西方之间也有可能这样架起桥梁。
    富尔说，法国没有奉行“两个中国”政策的理由。
