Xinhua News Agency, November 21st Dispatch from Washington: U.S. official sources revealed that the schedule for the United States to launch its first instrument-laden artificial satellite may have to be postponed. The United States originally planned to launch the satellite in March of next year.

These sources said that the U.S. artificial satellite ("Vanguard" experimental satellite) has been ready for months, but the rocket to launch it into orbit has not yet been manufactured. The "Jupiter" rocket, originally intended to launch the artificial satellite, requires considerable modification to launch the "Vanguard" satellite.

Anderson, a member and acting chairman of the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy of the Senate and House of Representatives, also said on the 19th that the Soviet Union is ahead of the United States in missiles by "a full two years." He said that the United States would need two more years to launch an Earth satellite with "any significant meaning."

Xinhua News Agency, November 20th Dispatch from Washington: The U.S. government is taking measures to militarize science.

The Department of Defense issued a directive a few days ago stating that it will "support broad and continuous programs of basic scientific research."

The Department of Defense requires "the establishment of effective links between the U.S. military and scientists so that the military can be constantly and increasingly aware of new scientific developments, and scientists will also be aware of military needs."

The U.S. government is also drafting a program to cultivate scientific talent, which is said to include providing financial assistance to outstanding students who wish to enter universities. Experts estimate that approximately 150,000 to 250,000 outstanding students in the United States are unable to attend university each year due to financial or other reasons.

    美国“先锋”卫星上天尚早
    发射卫星的火箭迄未制成
    新华社21日讯　华盛顿消息：美国官方人士透露，美国发射装有仪器的第一颗人造卫星的日程可能不得不推迟。美国原定在明年3月发射这颗卫星。
    这些人士说，美国的人造卫星（“先锋”试验卫星）已经准备好几个月了，但是把它发射到轨道上去的火箭却迟迟制造不成。原定用来发射人造卫星的“丘辟特”火箭需要进行相当大的改装，才能发射“先锋”卫星。
    参众两院联席原子能委员会委员和代理主席安德逊19日也说，苏联在导弹方面比美国领先“整整两年”。他说，美国还需要两年的时间才能发射一颗具有“任何重大意义的”地球卫星。
    新华社20日讯　华盛顿消息：美国政府正在采取措施使科学军事化。
    国防部在前几天发表了一个指令说：它将“支持广泛和继续不断的科学基本研究计划”。
    国防部要求“在美国军事部门和科学家之间建立有效的联系，这样，军事部门就可以不断地、而且越来越多地知道新的科学发展，而科学家也将知道军事上的需要。”
    美国政府还正在拟订一个培养科学人才的方案，据说这个方案将包括对希望进大学的优秀学生提供经济帮助。据专家估计，美国每年有大约十五万到二十五万优秀学生由于经济或其他原因不能进大学。
