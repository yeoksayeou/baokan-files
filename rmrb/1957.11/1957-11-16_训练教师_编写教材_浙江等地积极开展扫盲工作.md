Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 15th: Zhejiang Province's rural, fishing, and salt-producing areas are starting winter literacy work ahead of schedule. The province plans to organize 2.2 million people to enroll in schools this winter and next spring, more than double the number from last year.

Currently, all counties in the province have universally held five-to-seven-day training classes for key members of civilian-run teachers. Through extensive airing of views, big debates, and discussions, the direction, policies, and teaching business issues of literacy work have been further studied. At the same time, various regions have also selected and commended a number of outstanding civilian-run teachers and students.

In order to strengthen leadership, various regions have begun to hand over civilian-run schools to the leadership of the townships and communes; some regions are organizing forces to compile teaching materials.

Now, all townships and communes are actively mobilizing young and middle-aged people to enroll in schools. In some areas, civilian-run schools have already started classes, and it is expected that civilian-run schools throughout the province will universally start classes by the end of November or early December.

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 15th: Sichuan Province, which has eliminated illiteracy for more than 1.2 million people in the past four years, recently decided to eliminate illiteracy for more than 400,000 rural people from this winter to next autumn. At present, all parts of the province are making active use of the favorable conditions of a large number of secondary and primary school graduates and educated cadres going to the countryside to participate in agricultural production, and are actively carrying out literacy work in conjunction with the rural great debate and the great production movement.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing: Various parts of Jiangsu Province have recently universally held training classes for literacy cadres. After studying, the teachers have generally realized the importance of combining literacy work with strengthening the political and ideological education of farmers, and have strengthened their confidence in literacy work.

This winter and next spring, Jiangsu Province will organize three million farmers to enroll in schools. Cultural learning in rural areas will be closely combined with the great debate in rural areas to extensively carry out socialist ideological education for farmers. The political classes in civilian-run schools will also cooperate with the central task to educate students through reading newspapers and other methods.
