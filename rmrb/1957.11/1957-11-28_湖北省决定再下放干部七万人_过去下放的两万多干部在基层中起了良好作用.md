    Hubei Province Decides to Send Another 70,000 Cadres to Lower Levels
    The More Than 20,000 Cadres Sent Down in the Past Have Played a Good Role at the Grassroots Level

    (Our dispatch from Wuhan, November 27th) Hubei Province has decided to send 70,000 cadres to lower levels to strengthen the grassroots and participate in agricultural production. Among them, 7,000 cadres will be sent down from provincial-level organizations. This was announced by Zhang Tixue, Secretary of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Governor of Hubei Province, at a mobilization meeting of provincial-level organizations on the 26th. He called on the cadres being sent down to display revolutionary heroism, resolve to temper themselves through labor, and transform themselves into experts with firm proletarian ideology, viewpoints, and positions, and who are also familiar with production knowledge.

    Prior to this, Hubei Province had already sent more than 24,000 cadres to the grassroots this year, including 12 bureau-level cadres, 138 division-level cadres, and 1,036 section-level cadres. Among these, more than 8,000 have directly returned to agricultural production posts, while the rest have been sent down to townships, communities, and some counties and districts.

    The vast majority of these sent-down cadres have been able to work diligently and deeply, connect with the masses, and have played a significant role in transforming backward townships and communities. In Yingshan County, there were originally twelve backward townships and seventy-one backward communities. After the cadres were sent down for half a year, eight townships and forty-nine communities have been transformed. Pan Zhi, the Director of the Organization Department of the Hong'an County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, is an intellectual, but after he was sent down to Balixiang as the Party Branch Secretary in February this year, he has learned farming skills such as plowing, harrowing, and cultivating rice paddies, and has earned more than 1,000 work points. The masses praised him for three good qualities: good work, good attitude, and good labor production. After Ye Zhongxing, a district head of Xiaogan County, was sent down to Xindu Township as the Party Branch Secretary, he actively led the masses to repair embankments and 48 ditches, turning more than 300 mu of lake fields and more than 300 mu of wasteland into fertile land. He also personally found fertilizer sources to solve the fertilizer problem for more than 1,000 mu of land.

### 湖北省决定再下放干部七万人  过去下放的两万多干部在基层中起了良好作用

    湖北省决定再下放干部七万人
    过去下放的两万多干部在基层中起了良好作用
    本报武汉27日电　湖北省决定下放干部七万人去充实基层，参加农业生产。其中省直属机关下放干部七千人。这是中共湖北省委书记、湖北省长张体学在26日的省直属机关动员大会上宣布的。他号召下放的干部拿出革命的英雄气概，下决心到劳动中锻炼，把自己锻炼成一个既有坚定的无产阶级思想、观点、立场，又熟悉生产知识的专家。
    在这以前，湖北省今年已下放了二万四千多名干部去基层，其中有厅局长级干部十二人，处长级一百三十八人，科长级一千零三十六人。这些人中有八千多名直接回到农业生产岗位，其余都下放到乡社、街道和一些县区。
    这些下放干部绝大多数都能艰苦深入，联系群众，在改变落后乡社上起了很大作用。英山县原有十二个落后乡、七十一个落后社。在干部下放半年后，已改造了八个乡、四十九个社。中共红安县委组织部长潘植是知识分子，但他今年2月下到八里乡担任党总支书记以后，已学会了耕田、耙田、耖田等农活，做了一千多个工分。群众评他有三个好处：工作好，态度好，劳动生产好。孝感县的一个区长叶忠兴下放到新渡乡担任总支书记后，积极领导群众修垸子、修水沟四十八条。使三百多亩湖田和三百多亩荒地，变成了良田。他还亲自找肥源，解决了一千多亩地的肥料问题。
