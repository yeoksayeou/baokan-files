Taking the Road of the October Revolution

The October Revolution is like a bright lighthouse, illuminating the path forward for all mankind in the world. All oppressed classes and oppressed nations around the world have gained infinite hope, confidence, and courage from the October Revolution, and found a way to liberate themselves. The year the October Revolution broke out, Sun Yat-sen, China's great revolutionary pioneer, was in deep despair. He "devoted himself to the National Revolution for forty years," conducting one struggle after another, and encountering one failure after another. The victory of the October Revolution gave him tremendous encouragement. He believed that "with the Russian Revolution, the people of the world have produced a great hope." In 1918, Sun Yat-sen sent a telegram to Lenin in Shanghai, congratulating him on the success of the October Revolution. At that time, various imperialist countries were besieging the Soviet Union. This telegram from Mr. Sun Yat-sen went through many twists and turns, and was finally sent by overseas Chinese in the Americas. This was the earliest congratulatory telegram from people all over the world to celebrate the victory of the October Revolution. In 1921, Mr. Sun Yat-sen took office as the Extraordinary President in Guangzhou. In June, he received a letter from Chicherin, the People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union, written at the end of October of the previous year, discussing the restoration of trade between China and the Soviet Union. Mr. Sun Yat-sen happily replied, expressing his sincere "respect to you and my friend Lenin and all the friends who have achieved many accomplishments for the cause of human freedom," and sincerely proposed, "I hope to obtain private contact with you and other friends in Moscow. I pay close attention to your cause, especially the organization of your Soviets, your army, and your education. I hope to know everything that you and other friends can tell me in these matters, especially in education."

For the sake of China's freedom and liberation, Sun Yat-sen had appealed to capitalist countries for assistance countless times throughout his life. However, these capitalist countries always stood on the side of the Chinese people's enemies and opposed the Chinese people's liberation cause. All Sun Yat-sen received were ruthless blows. He had suffered losses and been deceived. Only after the October Revolution did he receive assistance from the Soviet Union, which was the only international assistance he received in his life. Deeply enlightened by the October Revolution and with the specific help of the Soviet Union and the Chinese Communist Party, Sun Yat-sen began the greatest transformation of his life, and his revolutionary thought took a big leap forward. "Taking Russia as a teacher" - this was the final conclusion he reached after countless hardships in his revolutionary career. Therefore, in 1924, he resolutely reorganized the Kuomintang and established the three major policies of alliance with Russia, alliance with the Communist Party, and assistance to peasants and workers. Back then, because Mr. Sun Yat-sen decided to "take the road of the Russians," he was able to obtain Soviet assistance and rely on the guidance of the Chinese Communist Party to achieve revolutionary progress in the extremely difficult situation of the Chinese revolution. Until the moment before his death, his thoughts turned to Moscow, hoping for the success of the Chinese revolution from the great Soviet Union.

The road that Sun Yat-sen traveled in his life reflects the most important and valuable political experience that the Chinese people have gained from a long period of revolutionary struggle, that is, the Chinese people must take the road of the October Revolution, must obtain the internationalist assistance of the Soviet Union, and must consolidate and develop the revolutionary friendship between China and the Soviet Union in order for the Chinese people to achieve true liberation.

After the death of Sun Yat-sen, traitors such as Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Jingwei successively betrayed the revolution, reversing Sun Yat-sen's legacy, opposing the Soviet Union, opposing the Communist Party, and opposing the people, plunging China into darkness. Led by the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people inherited and carried forward the unfinished will of Sun Yat-sen, led the people of the whole country to seize power from the three major enemies of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism, completed the democratic revolution, and established a new state of people's democracy. In the short eight years since the founding of the country, it has also achieved brilliant achievements in socialist revolution and socialist construction, and embarked on the broad road of socialism.

The Soviet Union's consistent selfless assistance to the Chinese people is a guarantee for the victory of the Chinese people's revolution and a guarantee for the success of China's socialist construction. In his will to the Soviet Union before his death, Mr. Sun Yat-sen earnestly expected that "the Soviet Union would welcome a strong and independent China as a good friend and ally," and that China and the Soviet Union would "join hands" to achieve the victory of "fighting for the freedom of the oppressed nations of the world." His ideal has now been realized under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party.

Forty years have passed, and the world situation has undergone fundamental changes. Before World War II, the territory of the socialist system accounted for only 17% of the world, the population accounted for about 9% of the world, and the industrial output accounted for about 10% of the world. Now, the territory of the socialist countries accounts for 26% of the world, the population accounts for about 35% of the world, and the industrial output accounts for about one-third of the world. The people of China and the socialist countries in Eurasia are all advancing along the road opened up by the October Revolution, achieving brilliant achievements, and continuing to develop rapidly. It has long been a foregone conclusion as to which system is superior, socialist or capitalist, and who will win and who will lose.

Contrary to the vast number of people all over the world, international imperialists have always been hostile to and opposed to the Soviet Union, opposed to the road of the October Revolution, and attempted to reverse the trend and make history go backwards. Not to mention the distant past, just last year alone, imperialism used the Soviet Union's correction of the mistake of the cult of personality and the events in Hungary to launch an anti-Soviet and anti-Communist countercurrent in the world. Echoing the imperialist anti-Soviet movement, the bourgeois rightists in our China also became restless. Finally, they took advantage of the Chinese Communist Party's rectification campaign this spring to launch various malicious slanders against the Soviet Union. They attempted to shake the unbreakable and invincible fraternal alliance between China and the Soviet Union. The path they are taking is exactly the path that Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Jingwei took thirty years ago; if they do not repent and change their course, their results will be no different from those of Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Jingwei.

Today, as we solemnly and enthusiastically celebrate the fortieth anniversary of the great October Revolution, we must hold high the banner of the October Revolution, defend the road of the October Revolution, consolidate and strengthen the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and advance towards the infinitely happy and beautiful society - communism!

    走十月革命的道路
    熊克武
    十月革命好像一座明亮的灯塔，照亮了全世界人类前进的道路。全世界一切被压迫阶级和被压迫民族从十月革命中，得到了无限的希望、信心和勇气，找到了解放自己的途径。十月革命爆发的那一年，中国伟大的革命先行者孙中山先生正陷于深重的绝望里，他“致力国民革命，凡四十年”，进行了一次又一次的奋斗，也遭遇到一次又一次的失败。十月革命的胜利，给予他莫大的鼓舞。他认为“有了俄国革命，世界人类便生出了一个大希望。”1918年，孙中山先生在上海致电列宁，祝贺十月革命的成功。当时各帝国主义正在包围着苏联，孙中山先生这一通电报经过许多曲折，最后才由美洲华侨设法发出。这是世界各国人民庆祝十月革命胜利最早的一通贺电。1921年，中山先生在广州就任非常大总统，6月间收到苏联人民外交委员会委员长齐契林上年10月底写给先生的信，商讨中苏恢复贸易，中山先生欣然回信，回信中不但真挚地表示“向您和我的朋友列宁以及所有为了人类自由事业而有许多成就的友人们致敬”，而且诚恳地提出“我希望与您及莫斯科的其他友人获得私人的接触。我非常注意你们的事业，特别是你们苏维埃的组织、你们军队和教育的组织。我希望知道您和其他友人在这些事情方面、特别是在教育方面所能告诉我的一切。”
    为了中国的自由解放，在孙中山先生的一生中，曾经无数次地向资本主义国家呼吁过援助，但是，这些资本主义国家，总是站在中国人民的敌人方面，反对中国人民的解放事业，孙中山先生所得到只是无情的打击，他吃过亏，上过当。只有在十月革命之后，他才得到了苏联的援助，这也就是他一生中所得到的唯一的国际的援助。孙中山先生受了十月革命的深刻启示，得到苏联和中国共产党的具体帮助，开始了他一生中最伟大的转变，他的革命思想向前大大地跃进了一步。“以俄为师”——这就是他一生从事革命事业，经过数不尽的艰难困苦，而得出的最后的结论。因此，他在1924年，毅然改组了国民党，确立了联俄、联共、扶助农工的三大政策。在中山先生当年，因为决定了“走俄国人的路”，这才能在中国革命十分艰苦的情况中得到了苏联的援助，依靠中国共产党的引导，获致革命的进展。直到他逝世的前一刻，他的心念还转向着莫斯科，把中国革命的成功，寄希望于伟大的苏联。
    孙中山先生一生所走过的道路，反映了中国人民从长期革命斗争中，所取得的一项最重要、最宝贵的政治经验，这就是中国人民必须走十月革命的道路，必须取得苏联的国际主义援助，必须巩固和发展中苏两国的革命友谊，中国人民才能得到真正的解放。
    孙中山先生逝世以后，蒋介石、汪精卫等败类相继叛卖革命，一反孙中山先生的遗教，反苏、反共、反人民，使中国陷于黑暗的境地。中国共产党领导着中国人民，继承和发扬了孙中山先生的未竟之志，领导着全国人民，从帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资产阶级三大敌人手里夺取了政权，完成了民主革命，建立了人民民主的新国家。在建国的短短八年里，又取得了社会主义革命和社会主义建设的辉煌成就，走上了社会主义的康庄大道。
    苏联对中国人民一贯无私的帮助，是中国人民革命胜利的保证，也是中国社会主义建设成功的保证。中山先生逝世前在留给苏联的遗书上，曾殷切期待：“苏联以良友及盟国而欢迎强盛独立之中国”，中苏两国“携手并进”，以取得“争世界被压迫民族自由”的胜利，他的理想，今天在中国共产党领导下已经实现了。
    时间过去了四十年，世界的局势发生了根本性的变化。第二次世界大战以前，社会主义体系的领土，仅占全世界的17％，人口约占全世界的9％，工业产量约占全世界的10％。现在，各社会主义国家的领土，已占全世界的26％，人口约占全世界35％，工业产量约占全世界的三分之一。中国和欧亚两洲各社会主义国家的人民，都正在沿着十月革命所开辟的道路前进，取得了辉煌的成就，并且还在迅速地继续向前发展。社会主义制度与资本主义制度谁优谁劣，谁胜谁败，早已成为定局了。
    同全世界广大人民相反，国际帝国主义者却始终是敌视和反对苏联，反对十月革命的道路，妄想开倒车，让历史走回头路。远的且不说，仅仅去年一年，帝国主义就利用苏联纠正个人崇拜的错误，利用匈牙利的事件，在全世界掀起反苏、反共的逆流。同帝国主义反苏运动相呼应，我们中国的资产阶级右派也蠢蠢欲动，终于利用今年春天中国共产党整风的时机，对苏联进行了各种恶毒的诽谤，他们妄图摇撼中苏两国牢不可破与不可战胜的兄弟同盟。他们所走的路子，正是三十年前蒋介石、汪精卫所走过的路子；他们如果不幡然悔悟、改弦更张的话，其结果和蒋介石、汪精卫也不会有什么两样。
    今天，当我们隆重热烈地庆祝伟大的十月革命四十周年的时候，必须高举十月革命的旗帜，保卫十月革命的道路，巩固和加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结，向着无限幸福和美好的社会——共产主义前进！
