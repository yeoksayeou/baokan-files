    Rostov Economic Region Under the Administration of the National Economic Council
    P. Abroskin, Chairman of the National Economic Council of the Rostov Economic Region of the Soviet Union
    The Rostov Oblast, belonging to the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, is one of the largest industrial and agricultural regions within the Russian Republic. The main industrial sectors within the oblast are machine manufacturing, metallurgy, food industry, and light industry. Agriculture primarily focuses on grain production and animal husbandry. Recently, fruit tree cultivation and grape cultivation, which has a long history on the Don River, have also been widely developed.
    Before the Great October Socialist Revolution, the Rostov Oblast was one of our country's major agricultural raw material production areas. Agricultural products accounted for 80% of the oblast's total output.
    During the Soviet era, the oblast's economy underwent fundamental reforms. The Rostov Oblast transformed into an industrial and agricultural region. The economy of the Rostov Oblast, like the national economy of the Soviet Union, is currently in a new stage of vigorous development. The restructuring of the management of industry and construction, initiated by the Communist Party and supported by all the Soviet people, has greatly promoted this development.
    The new management system for industrial enterprises and construction projects is in line with the spirit of further realizing Lenin's principle of democratic centralism in the field of economic construction and is increasingly demonstrating its superiority. The National Economic Council is effectively solving organizational and economic problems, delving into the life of production units, improving the specialization and collaboration of industries, and discovering and utilizing untapped potential. All of this has played a significant role in further increasing production.
    A total of one hundred and five National Economic Councils have been established throughout the Soviet Union, seventy of which are in the Russian Republic. Among the seventy National Economic Councils in the Russian Republic, twenty are first-level councils. The National Economic Council of the Rostov Economic Region, established in the Rostov Oblast, belongs to this category. The Rostov Economic Region National Economic Council consists of nine people, including one chairman who leads the entire council, four vice-chairmen, and four members who concurrently serve as leaders of the council's various departments and bureaus. The organization of the Economic Council consists of twelve departments (technical, production, planning and economics, collaboration and inter-regional liaison, labor and wages, finance, and other departments) and ten specialized administrations (machine manufacturing, agricultural machine manufacturing, construction, food industry, light industry, wine making, etc.). The total number of staff in the National Economic Council's organization is seven hundred.
    The National Economic Council has a technical and economic committee, which serves as an advisory body. The main tasks of the technical and economic committee are to review general issues concerning the development of the economic region's industry, intra-regional and inter-regional collaboration, discuss major production technology and economic issues, and discuss measures related to ensuring the completion of plans, improving labor productivity, reducing costs, and improving product quality. Participants in the technical and economic committee include staff of the National Economic Council, well-known experts, innovators, and advanced producers, as well as leaders from Party, Soviet, economic, trade union, scientific research, and other organs. The chairman of the technical and economic committee is concurrently held by the chairman of the National Economic Council.
    The enterprises under the administration of the Rostov National Economic Council's specialized administrations number 265, producing approximately 80% of the oblast's total industrial output. The electrical locomotives produced by enterprises within the economic region account for 100% of the national total, steam boilers and grain combine harvesters account for half of the national total, and row crop tractors account for 54%. The factories under the National Economic Council also produce crankshafts, hydraulic presses, metal cutting lathes, instruments, and many other products.
    When the National Economic Council took over industry, the industrial enterprises completed 103.4% of the state plan for the first half of the year. At the same time, while the overall completion of the plan was satisfactory, some factories, including the "Rostov Agricultural Machinery Plant," the "Taganrog Automatic Combine Harvester Plant," and other large factories, failed to fulfill the state plan.
    After the National Economic Council took vigorous measures, the situation improved within a short period, and many lagging enterprises, including the aforementioned combine harvester plants, began to fulfill the state plan in July and August. It is worth noting that the total output of enterprises under the National Economic Council in July had already increased by 14.5% compared to the average monthly output in the first half of the year. Production continued to increase in August, reaching 118.5% of the average monthly output in the first half of the year.
    The various specialized administrations and departments of the National Economic Council follow the principle in their work that the situation of each enterprise should not be viewed and assisted according to some established routine and uniform framework. Each enterprise has its own characteristics, which must be taken into account when analyzing the work of a factory. In most cases, the staff of the various administrations proactively cooperate with the factory leaders to solve urgent problems without waiting for the National Economic Council to issue instructions to intervene in the work of a certain enterprise.
    One of the important methods of utilizing the internal potential of the economic region is to implement specialization of production and develop collaboration. For example, machine manufacturing is unimaginable without a well-developed foundry industry. Such a top-priority issue was the object of discussion at the first meeting of the Technical and Economic Committee. Based on the recommendations of the Technical and Economic Committee, the National Economic Council adopted a resolution on the specialization of foundry workshops. This resolution has already been put into practice.
    The National Economic Council has also done a lot of work to drastically improve the work of construction organizations.
    The National Economic Council's work in utilizing the internal potential of the economic region is only a beginning. Based on the suggestions of factory employees, we have formulated the plan for 1958. This plan stipulates that industrial output should be further increased. The volume of capital construction, especially the tasks of housing construction and cultural and recreational facilities, will be greatly increased. The plan emphasizes the development of new technologies and the production of building materials. The plan stipulates the production of one hundred and twelve new varieties of products, including the large-scale production of powerful "VL-23" type electric locomotives, the manufacture of large steam boilers producing five hundred and forty and four hundred and twenty tons of steam per hour, and the mass production of "SK-3" type automatic combine harvesters. It must be pointed out that the plan also stipulates that specialization should be widely implemented, primarily the specialization of metallurgical production, and that collaboration within and outside the economic region should be developed on this basis.
    Not long ago, the economic region held a meeting of Party and economic activists to discuss the work achievements of industry and construction in the past months of 1957. All those present unanimously pointed out that the new management system for industry and construction has opened up broad possibilities for utilizing unlimited internal potential to increase production with the same production capacity. The meeting of Party and economic activists adopted a resolution endorsing the socialist guarantee conditions undertaken by the workers of the economic region to complete the annual plan before December 22, 1957, and to overproduce three hundred million rubles of products by enterprises under the National Economic Council. The results of the first few months of work by the enterprises under the new conditions give us confidence that the guarantee conditions they have undertaken will be gloriously realized.

    在国民经济委员会管理下的罗斯托夫经济区
    苏联罗斯托夫经济区国民经济委员会主席　帕·阿布罗斯金
    属俄罗斯苏维埃联邦社会主义共和国所辖的罗斯托夫州是俄罗斯共和国内最大的工业和农业区之一。州内的主要工业部门是机器制造业、冶金业、食品工业和轻工业。农业则主要是谷物生产和养畜业。近来，果树栽培和在顿河上有悠久历史的葡萄种植业，也广泛地发展了起来。
    在伟大十月社会主义革命以前，罗斯托夫州是我国巨大的农业原料产区之一。农产品占全州产品的80％。
    在苏维埃政权的年代里，州内的经济得到了根本的改革。罗斯托夫州变成了工业和农业区。罗斯托夫州的经济，和苏联全国的经济一样，目前正处于蓬勃发展的新阶段。由共产党倡导，经全体苏联人民赞助而实行的改组对工业和建筑业的管理，大大地促进了这一发展。
    对工业企业和建筑工程的新管理制度，符合在经济建设领域中进一步实现列宁的民主集中制原则的精神，并日益充分地显示出它的优越性。国民经济委员会在卓有成效地解决组织问题和经济问题，深入生产单位的生活，改进工业的专业化和协作，发掘并动用尚未发挥的潜力。这一切都对进一步提高生产起了重大的作用。
    苏联全国一共建立了一百零五个国民经济委员会，其中在俄罗斯共和国的有七十个。而俄罗斯共和国的七十个国民经济委员会当中，有二十个是一级的，在罗斯托夫州建立的罗斯托夫经济区的国民经济委员会，就是属于这一类的。罗斯托夫经济区的国民经济委员会由九个人组成，其中主席一人，领导整个委员会，四个副主席和四个委员，同时兼任委员会各部、局的领导人。经济委员会的机构，由十二个处（技术、生产、计划经济、协作和区间联系、劳动和工资、财政及其它等处）和十个专业管理局（机器制造业、农业机器制造业、建筑业、食品工业、轻工业、葡萄酒酿造业等等）组成。国民经济委员会机构的总人数是七百人。
    国民经济委员会下设技术经济委员会，起咨询机关的作用。技术经济委员会的主要任务，是审查发展经济区的工业、区内和区间协作的一般问题，讨论重大的生产技术和经济问题，讨论有关保证完成计划、提高劳动生产率、降低成本和提高产品质量方面的措施。参加技术经济委员会的，有国民经济委员会的工作人员，有著名的专家、革新者和先进生产者，以及党、苏维埃、经济机关、工会、科学研究等机关的领导人。技术经济委员会的主席，由国民经济委员会主席兼任。
    归罗斯托夫国民经济委员会各专业管理局所管理的企业，达二百六十五个，出产全州80％左右的工业产品。经济区内的企业所生产的电气机车为全国总产量的100％，蒸汽锅炉和谷物联合收割机为全国总产量的半数，中耕机则为54％。在国民经济委员会所属的工厂里，还生产曲柄、水压机、金属切削车床、仪器及其它好多种产品。
    在国民经济委员会接管工业的时候，各工业企业完成了上半年国家计划的103．4％。同时，在总的完成了计划令人满意的情况下，有些工厂，包括“罗斯托夫农机厂”、“塔干罗格自动联合收割机厂”及其它等大工厂在内，却没有完成国家计划。
    国民经济委员会采取有力措施后，在短时期内情况有了好转，而且好些落后企业，包括上述各联合收割机厂在内，在7、8两月份就开始完成了国家计划。值得注意的是，7月份国民经济委员会所属各企业的总产量，已经比上半年的月平均产量增加了14．5％。8月份继续增产，达到上半年月平均的118．5％。
    国民经济委员会各专业管理局和各处，在工作中遵循着这样一个原则：不能按照某种既定的成规和统一的框子来看待各个企业的情况和进行帮助。每个企业都有其特点，在分析一个工厂的工作时必须予以考虑。各管理局的工作人员，在大多数场合下，不等国民经济委员会发出必需干预某企业工作的指示，便主动地去协同工厂的领导人解决迫切的问题。
    利用经济区内部潜力的重要方法之一，就是实行生产的专业化和发展协作。例如，如果没有很发达的铸造业，机器制造业是不可想像的。这样一个头等重要的问题，就是技术经济委员会第一次会议讨论的对象。根据技术经济委员会提出的建议，国民经济委员会通过了有关铸造车间专业化的决议。这项决议已经付诸实行。
    国民经济委员会为急剧改进建筑机构的工作，也做了很多工作。
    国民经济委员会在利用经济区内部潜力方面的工作，还只是一个开端。我们根据工厂职工的建议，制定了1958年的计划。这个计划规定还要进一步增加工业产量。基本建设的工程量，特别是住宅建设和文化生活设施的任务，将大大增加。计划中重视发展新技术和生产建筑材料。计划规定生产一百一十二种新品种的产品，其中包括大规模生产“ВЛ—23”式强大的电气机车，制造每小时生产五百四十和四百二十吨蒸汽的大蒸汽锅炉，大量生产“СК—3”式的自动联合收割机。必须指出，计划还规定要广泛地实行专业化，而首先是冶金生产的专业化，并在这个基础上发展经济区内外的协作。
    不久以前，经济区举行了党和经济界积极分子会议，讨论1957年已过去的那些月份的工业、建筑业的工作成果。到会的人都异口同声地指出，对工业和建筑业的新管理制度，为利用无限的内部潜力，以同样的生产能力来增加生产，开辟了广泛的可能性。党和经济界积极分子会议通过决议，赞同经济区劳动者所承担的关于在1957年12月22日前完成全年计划，并使国民经济委员会所属企业超计划生产三亿卢布产品的社会主义保证条件。各企业在新的条件下工作的头几个月的成果，使我们相信，他们所承担的保证条件，一定会光荣地实现。
