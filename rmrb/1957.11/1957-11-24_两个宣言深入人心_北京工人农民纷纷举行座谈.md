Xinhua News Agency, 23rd dispatch: Beijing's workers and peasants held discussion meetings today to discuss the "Declaration of the Meeting of Representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of Socialist Countries" and the "Peace Manifesto" issued by the Meeting of Representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties. Workers and peasants expressed their warm support for these two declarations in their speeches.

Factories and agricultural production cooperatives that held discussion meetings today included: Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory, Beijing No. 2 Cotton Textile Mill, Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory, Central Telegraph Building Construction Site, Sino-Soviet Friendship Agricultural Production Cooperative, Lugouqiao Agricultural Production Cooperative, etc. Workers and peasants expressed excitedly at many discussion meetings held today: After reading these two declarations, they are even more full of confidence in building our socialist country. They fully agree with the analysis of the current international situation in the Declaration of the Meeting of Representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of Socialist Countries. At the same time, they believe that the propositions in this declaration to strengthen the unity and cooperation between socialist countries, communist parties and workers' parties of all countries; strengthen the unity of the international workers' movement, the national liberation movement and the democratic movement; promote socialist ideas and the peace and friendship of the people of all countries; defend peace and oppose war are entirely correct.

In their speeches, they believed that the "Peace Manifesto" reflects the common voice of the people of the world today.

At a discussion meeting held by some workers of the state-owned Beijing No. 2 Cotton Textile Mill, Wang Guilan, a worker in the weaving workshop, said: "These two declarations greatly encourage our confidence in building socialism." Li Zhengrong, a worker in the weaving workshop, said: "In our country, working people engage in labor as masters of their own affairs, with one heart and one mind, and we can create any great deed. This is the greatest superiority of our socialist system." He also said: "The population of socialist countries accounts for one-third of the world's population. These more than 900 million people are united, so they can do more than 900 million people; while the imperialist camp is disintegrating, and the working people hate and resist the rulers who ride on their heads. Therefore, to calculate strength, you have to give them a few discounts."

When discussing the Peace Manifesto, the staff and workers felt very angry about the crimes of imperialism deliberately creating war. The staff and workers unanimously expressed that they must enthusiastically respond to the call of the Peace Manifesto and take on the responsibility of stopping war by working hard in production and accelerating the construction of their own country.

At a discussion meeting held by some veteran workers of the Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory, Hang Baohua, a 59-year-old veteran worker of the "February 7th" strike, said: "I heard these two declarations on the radio. Today, the world situation has undergone a new change, and the strength of the socialist camp exceeds that of the imperialist camp, and my confidence is even greater. The people of the world are united, and peace is more guaranteed."

Construction workers building the Central Telegraph Building unanimously stated at the discussion meeting: The high-rise buildings built by construction workers with their own hands are like mothers treating babies, and they will never allow war to destroy them.

Engineering and technical personnel of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant stated in their speeches at the discussion meeting that the unprecedented development of industry, science and technology in the Soviet Union and other socialist countries is an important guarantee for preventing war and safeguarding peace. Mechanical engineer Tan Zhizhong said that the era in which American imperialism was at the forefront of science and technology has ended, and the two artificial satellites launched by the Soviet Union that are running in the sky are obvious proof. Civil engineering engineer Du Mingyang said that these two declarations are a great call to all mankind. As a scientific and technical worker in a socialist country, I must work hard in my position and contribute technology to the socialist cause of peaceful construction, further strengthen the forces for safeguarding peace, and make all mankind move towards a bright and happy future.

The twelve Communist Party members among the workers of the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory all believed at the discussion meeting convened by the Party Committee of the factory that the declaration of the meeting of representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries expressed the wishes of the working people. It is a powerful guarantee for the inevitable victory of socialist countries and a powerful warning to imperialist war instigators.

The peasants of Lugouqiao stated at the discussion meeting held today that these two declarations expressed their wishes. After Li Yinhai talked about the great improvement in the lives of the farmers in this cooperative in recent years, he said that the declarations of the Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries have further strengthened our confidence in taking the socialist road. At the discussion meeting of the farmers of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Agricultural Cooperative in the suburbs of Beijing, Ma Fengshan, deputy secretary of the Party committee, pointed to the photos of Khrushchev and Chairman Mao signing the declaration published in the newspaper and said excitedly: "The leaders of the Communist and Workers' Parties of twelve socialist countries have all signed the declaration, which shows that the Communist Parties of the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union are linked heart to heart, the socialist countries are linked heart to heart, and our socialism is more consolidated, more united, and more powerful." Liu Shuyu, leader of the production team and a Communist Party member, said: "When all our socialist countries and peace-loving people of the world unite like steel, they will generate great and unparalleled power."

    两个宣言深入人心
    北京工人农民纷纷举行座谈
    据新华社23日讯　北京市的工人、农民今天分别举行座谈会，讨论“社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议宣言”及共产党和工人党代表会议发表的“和平宣言”。工人、农民在发言中热烈拥护这两个宣言。
    今天举行座谈会的工厂和农业生产合作社有：石景山钢铁厂、长辛店机车车辆修理工厂、北京第二棉纺织厂、北京农业机械厂、中央电报大楼建筑工地、中苏友好农业生产合作社、芦沟桥农业生产合作社等。工人和农民在今天举行的许多座谈会上兴奋地表示：他们读了这两个宣言以后，对于建设我们的社会主义国家，更加充满了信心。他们十分同意社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议宣言中对于目前国际形势的分析，他们同时认为这个宣言中对加强社会主义国家、各国共产党和工人党之间的团结和合作；加强国际工人运动、民族解放运动和民主运动的团结；宣传社会主义思想和各国人民的和平友好；保卫和平，反对战争等主张，是十分正确的。
    他们在发言中，认为“和平宣言”是反映了当前全世界人民的共同呼声。
    在国营北京第二棉纺织厂一部分工人举行的座谈会上，织布车间工人王贵兰说：“这两个宣言大大鼓舞了我们建设社会主义的信心”。织布车间工人李正荣说：“在我们的国家中，劳动人民以主人翁的姿态从事劳动，上下一条心，什么伟大的事迹我们都创造得出来。这就是我们社会主义制度最大的优越性。”他又说：“社会主义国家的人口占了全世界人口的三分之一，这九亿多人民是团结一致的，因此就能做出比九亿多人口更多的事；而帝国主义阵营却是分崩离析的，劳动人民仇恨、反抗骑在他们头上的统治者。因此要计算力量，得给他们打上几个折扣。”
    在讨论到和平宣言的时候，职工们对帝国主义蓄意制造战争的罪行，感到十分气忿。职工们一致表示：一定热烈响应和平宣言的号召，用努力生产，加紧建设自己的祖国，来担负起制止战争的责任。
    在长辛店机车车辆修理工厂部分老工人举行的座谈会上，五十九岁的“二七”老工人杭宝华说：“我从收音机里听到这两个宣言。今天，世界形势已发生新的转变，社会主义阵营力量超过帝国主义阵营的力量，我的信心更大了。全世界人民都团结起来了，和平更有保障了。”
    建设中央电报大楼的建筑工人在座谈会上一致表示：建筑工人用双手盖成的高楼大厦，好像母亲对待婴儿一样，决不允许战争来破坏。
    石景山钢铁厂工程技术人员在座谈会上的发言中认为：苏联和其他社会主义国家工业、科学技术的空前发展，是制止战争保卫和平的重要保证。机械工程师谭志中说，在科学技术上美帝国主义名列前茅的时代已经结束了，苏联发射的正在天空运行的两颗人造卫星就是明显的证明。土木建筑工程师杜名扬说，这两个宣言是对全人类的伟大召唤，作为一个社会主义国家的一个科学技术工作者，我要在自己的岗位上辛勤地劳动，把技术贡献于社会主义的和平建设事业，进一步壮大保卫和平的力量，使全人类走向光明幸福的未来。
    北京农业机械厂工人中的十二名共产党员在该厂党委会召开的座谈会上都认为各国共产党和工人党代表会议的宣言表达了劳动人民的意愿，它是社会主义国家必胜的有力保证，是对帝国主义战争挑拨者的有力警告。
    芦沟桥的农民在今天举行的座谈会上表示，这两个宣言表达了他们的愿望。李荫海讲了这个合作社农民几年来生活有了很大改善情况后说，各国共产党和工人党的宣言更加坚定了我们走社会主义道路的信心。在京郊中苏友好农业社农民们的座谈会上，党委副书记马风山指着报上刊登的赫鲁晓夫和毛主席在宣言上签字的照片，兴奋地说：“十二个社会主义国家共产党和工人党的领袖在宣言上都签了字，这说明以苏联为首的社会主义各国的共产党心连心，社会主义国家心连心，我们社会主义是更巩固、更团结、更强大了。”生产组长、共产党员刘树玉说：“我们所有社会主义国家和全世界爱好和平的人民团结起来像钢铁一样就会产生伟大无比的力量。”
