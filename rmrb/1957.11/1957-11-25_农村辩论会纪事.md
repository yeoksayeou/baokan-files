    Chronicle of a Rural Debate
    Yan Ling
    What's going on?
    "The other day we asked you to sell surplus grain,
    You said your yield was less than the cooperative's;
    Today we're debating whether cooperation is good or not,
    And you say your yield is higher than the cooperative's.
    What's going on?
    Explain yourself to everyone!"
    The meeting hall erupted in laughter,
    As one person scratched his head, unable to utter a word.
    Who to blame?
    "This year the cooperative's output decreased,
    Next year I'm going it alone!"
    Han Shiyuan's anger soared,
    Muttering and grumbling in complaint.
    "How did the cooperative's output decrease?
    Don't blame the land or the heavens;
    Don't blame agricultural cooperation,
    Don't blame the cadres for being insincere.
    This year's wheat harvest was during hot weather,
    Leaving work at dusk to return home,
    One member walked slowly,
    Dragging behind.
    Was he tired from threshing?
    Why are his legs so thick and round?
    The cooperative leader concerned went to comfort him,
    A touch revealed the truth.
    He was wearing two pairs of pants at once,
    The four pant legs sewn together.
    Taking advantage of people's inattention,
    He filled the pant legs with wheat. . . "
                    ＊
    "Some went to the fields carrying large water jugs,
    Some went to the fields carrying bread baskets.
    Bread eaten, water drunk,
    They filled them with grain ears to take home.
    If everyone did this,
    How could the cooperative not have a reduced output?"
    "There are also two production teams,
    Who threshed lightly on purpose;
    Waiting until the cooperative's distribution was complete,
    They secretly threshed again.
    If the production team hides its yield,
    How can the cooperative not have a reduced output?"
                    ＊
    "In summer, the seedlings grew happily,
    Weeds also shot upwards.
    Some members left home,
    Abandoning agriculture to go into business to make money.
    Half of the autumn fields were left uncultivated,
    How can the cooperative not have a reduced output?"
    "Not doing farm work but trading as merchants,
    Including you, Han Shiyuan.
    You want to take the lead in withdrawing from the cooperative,
    Clutching a cold-blooded exploiter's abacus.
    This path will not work,
    Better pack up your stall early!"

    农村辩论会纪事
    燕凌
    怎么回事？
    “前天叫你卖余粮，
    你说你的产量比社里的少；
    今天辩论合作化好不好，
    你又说你的产量比社里的高。
    这是怎么一回事？
    你向大家说分晓！”
    会场上一阵哈哈笑，
    只见有个人一言不发把头搔。
    怨谁？
    “今年社里减了产，
    明年我还要单干！”
    韩世元怒气冲天高，
    嘟嘟囔囔直埋怨。
    “社里怎么减了产？
    别怨地来别怨天；
    别怨农业合作化，
    别怨干部心不专。
    今年麦收大热天，
    黄昏收工回家转，
    一个社员走得慢，
    拖拖拉拉在后边。
    是不是打场累着啦？
    怎么两腿粗又圆？
    社长关心去慰问，
    一摸可就露了馅。
    原来他两条裤子一齐穿，
    四只裤脚缝住了边。
    趁着人们不留神，
    麦子装满了裤脚管。……”
                    ＊
    “有人下地提上大水罐，
    有人下地提上馍馍篮。
    馍馍吃光水喝干，
    装满谷穗回家转。
    人们都要这样干，
    社里怎能不减产？”
    “还有两个生产队，
    打场故意轻轻干；
    等到社里分配完，
    悄悄再来打一遍。
    生产队里要瞒产，
    怎叫社里不减产？”
                    ＊
    “夏天苗儿长得欢，
    野草也在往上窜。
    有些社员离了家，
    弃农从商去赚钱。
    秋田荒了一小半，
    怎叫社里不减产？”
    “不做农活做商贩，
    其中就有你韩世元。
    你想带头闹退社，
    打着剥削人的铁算盘。
    这条道儿走不通，
    趁早收起你的摊！”
