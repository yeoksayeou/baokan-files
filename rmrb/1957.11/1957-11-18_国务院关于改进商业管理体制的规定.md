The State Council’s Provisions on Improving the Commercial Management System

First, the establishment of local (province, autonomous region, municipality, county) commercial organizations shall be determined by the people's committees of each province, autonomous region, and municipality based on the specific local conditions. When two or more commercial administrative organizations are merged, they may not implement independent accounting of the original systems in financial terms, but implement unified accounting. However, in terms of business policy, they shall still separately accept the guidance of the original competent commercial departments. Local commercial administrative organizations and enterprise management organizations shall, in principle, be merged. For example, changing various commercial organizations into an organizational form that combines administration and enterprise management, abolishing the original local specialized commercial companies, and merging them into the commercial administrative organizations. Some large cities or certain regions may not be merged if they are deemed difficult to merge after research.

Second, the purchasing and supplying stations (first-level wholesale stations, large cold storage facilities, warehouses) set up by the central commercial departments in cities or ports with concentrated production shall implement dual leadership with the central commercial departments taking the lead and local leadership as supplementary. The purchasing and supplying stations (second-level wholesale stations) set up by the commercial administrative organizations of provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities shall implement dual leadership with the commercial administrative organizations of provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities taking the lead and the local government leadership as supplementary.

Third, all processing enterprises under the central commercial departments, except for some large enterprises that the local authorities deem difficult to manage, shall be transferred to the local authorities and directly managed by the local commercial departments. The regulations on production tasks, product specifications and standards, adjustment of production equipment capacity, and regulations on processing fees for these decentralized processing enterprises shall still be uniformly managed by the central commercial departments in order to balance national production.

Fourth, the State Council shall only issue four commercial planning indicators annually, namely: (1) procurement plan, (2) sales plan, (3) total number of employees, and (4) profit target; at the same time, localities are allowed to have a 5% upward or downward flexibility in the implementation of the total amount of the procurement and sales plans. However, changes in the figures of planned commodities controlled by the central commercial departments must be approved by the central competent commercial departments. For products exceeding the plan produced by local industries, if the commercial departments are required to purchase them, they can be purchased exceeding the plan after approval by the higher-level competent commercial departments. Changes in the purchase and sales figures of grain, oil, and cotton purchased nationwide under the plan must be approved by the State Council. If the people's committees of provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities deem it necessary under special circumstances, they may make changes first and then report to the State Council for record. In the future, it is planned to gradually only issue profit targets to the provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities, and no longer issue them to grassroots enterprises, so as to avoid grassroots stores engaging in activities that violate commercial policies in order to reluctantly complete the profit targets. However, the central commercial departments should formulate methods to ensure that the profits of grassroots enterprises cannot be reduced on their own. Because the measure of only issuing profit targets to provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities, and no longer issuing them to grassroots enterprises is a major change, it is not appropriate to implement it immediately and completely nationwide. The central commercial departments must first conduct trials in one or two provinces or regions, and then promote it after the trial is effective.

Fifth, the enterprise profits of the central commercial departments shall be divided with the local authorities at full amount. Provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities shall not participate in the profit sharing of grain management and the export portion of foreign trade, but the domestic sales portion of foreign trade shall still be shared with the provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities. Supply and marketing cooperatives shall continue to implement the method of member dividends, withdrawal of public accumulation funds and other funds. The catering and service industries that are currently included in local revenue shall remain unchanged. Except for the above items, the enterprise profits of the central commercial departments shall be divided with the local authorities at a ratio of 20% to the local authorities and 80% to the central government.

When commercial departments are required to conduct loss-making purchases or sales for production and disaster relief, the people's committees of provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities are authorized to instruct local commercial departments to handle them. If there is a loss, it can be included in the enterprise loss and offset by commercial profits.

Sixth, the division of labor in commodity price management. In terms of agricultural and sideline products, the purchase prices and sales prices of materials that belong to planned purchase (unified purchase) and unified purchase shall be uniformly stipulated by the central commercial departments, but in non-major producing areas, the local governments shall be entrusted to manage them according to the price levels stipulated by the central commercial departments, and the purchase prices of unified purchased waste copper, waste tin, and waste steel shall also be handled in the same way; the prices of third-category materials and the prices of materials determined by the local authorities as local unified purchases shall be managed by the local governments, but they should refer to the price levels controlled by the central commercial departments, and the central government shall stipulate the range of price increases and decreases once a year. In terms of industrial products, the purchase prices of materials uniformly allocated by the State Economic Commission, or the purchase prices of materials uniformly distributed by various industrial departments, shall be handled in accordance with the allocation prices stipulated by the state. Except for this, all other industrial product purchase prices shall be managed by the provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities according to the principles stipulated by the central commercial departments; for the sales prices of industrial products in the market, the central commercial departments shall stipulate the prices for major markets and major commodities, and the provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities shall independently set prices for secondary markets and secondary commodities based on the pricing principles stipulated by the central commercial departments, and pay attention to consultation with neighboring regions. The central and local governments shall establish unified price management institutions at all levels. The central government shall convene a price meeting once a year to formulate the annual price level.

Seventh, implement foreign exchange sharing. In order to encourage localities to actively complete the state's export plan and strive for excess exports of certain industrial and agricultural products, the central government will give the localities a certain percentage of the foreign exchange earned. The specific measures will be notified separately.

### 国务院关于改进商业管理体制的规定

    国务院关于改进商业管理体制的规定
    第一、地方（省、自治区、市、县）商业机构的设置，由各省、自治区、直辖市人民委员会根据地方的具体情况决定。当着两个或两个以上的商业行政机构合并设置的时候，在财务上可以不实行原来各系统的独立核算，而实行统一核算；但是，在业务方针政策上仍旧分别接受原来所属主管商业部门的指导。地方商业行政机构和企业管理机构，原则上实行合并。例如，把各商业机构改变为行政与企业管理合一的组织形式，取消地方上原有的商业专业公司，合并到商业行政机构内。有些大城市或某些地区，经过研究认为不能合并的，也可以不合并。
    第二、中央各商业部门设在生产集中的城市或者口岸的采购供应站（一级批发站、大型冷藏库、仓库），实行以中央各商业部门领导为主、地方领导为辅的双重领导。省、自治区、直辖市商业行政机构设置的采购供应站（二级批发站），实行由省、自治区、直辖市的商业行政机构领导为主、所在地政府领导为辅的双重领导。
    第三、中央各商业部门所属加工企业，除了某些大型企业，地方认为管理有困难的以外，其余全部移交给地方，由地方商业部门直接管理。这些下放的加工企业，有关生产任务的规定、产品的规格标准、生产设备能力的调整和加工工缴费用的规定，仍旧由中央各商业部门统一管理，以便平衡全国生产。
    第四、商业计划指标，国务院每年只颁发四个指标，即：（一）收购计划，（二）销售计划，（三）职工总数，（四）利润指标；同时允许地方在收购计划和销售计划总额的执行中，有百分之五的上或下的机动幅度。但是，对于中央各商业部门控制的计划商品的数字的变动，必须经过中央各主管商业部门的批准。对于地方工业生产的超计划的产品，如果要求商业部门收购的时候，经过上级主管商业部门的批准，可以超计划收购。对于全国计划收购的粮食、油脂、棉花的购销数字的变动，必须经过国务院的批准。如果省、自治区、直辖市人民委员会在特殊情况下认为必要的时候，可以先行变动，再报国务院备案。今后对利润指标拟逐渐只下达到省、自治区、直辖市掌握，不再下达到各基层企业，以免基层商店为了勉强完成利润指标而作违反商业政策的活动。但是，中央各商业部门应该规定办法，保证各基层企业的利润不能自行降低。因为利润指标只下达到省、自治区、直辖市掌握、不再下达到基层企业的这样一种措施是一项重大的变动，不宜在全国立即全部实行，必须由中央各商业部门先在一、两个省、区内试行，试行有效后，再行推广。
    第五、中央各商业部门的企业利润，实行与地方全额分成。粮食经营和对外贸易的外销部分的利润，省、自治区、直辖市不参与分成，但是对外贸易的内销部分仍旧和省、自治区、直辖市分成。供销合作社仍旧实行社员分红、提取公积金和其他基金的办法。现在归地方收入的饮食、服务性行业，仍归地方不变。除了上述几项以外，中央各商业部门的企业利润，都和地方实行二八分成，就是以利润中的百分之二十归地方，百分之八十归中央。
    为了生产救灾而要商业部门进行有亏损的收购或者销售的时候，授权省、自治区、直辖市人民委员会责成地方商业部门办理，如有亏损，可列入企业亏损，由商业利润抵补。
    第六、商品价格管理的分工。在农、副产品方面，凡是属于计划收购（统购）和统一收购的物资的收购价格和销售价格，由中央各商业部门统一规定，但是在非主要产区则委托地方政府根据中央各商业部门规定的价格水平来管理，统一收购的废铜、废锡、废钢铁的收购价格也照此办理；对第三类物资的价格和由地方确定为本地统一收购的物资的价格，由地方政府管理，但是应该参照中央各商业部门掌握的价格水平，并且每年由中央规定一次价格升降的幅度。在工业品方面，国家经济委员会统一调拨的物资的收购价格，或者各工业部门所管的统一分配的物资的收购价格，都按照国家规定的调拨价格办理，除此以外，所有其他工业品的收购价格，按照中央各商业部门规定的原则由省、自治区、直辖市管理；工业品在市场的销售价格，主要市场和主要商品由中央各商业部门规定价格，次要市场和次要商品由省、自治区、直辖市根据中央各商业部门规定的订价原则自行订价，并且注意同毗邻地区协商。中央和地方设立统一的各级物价管理机构，中央每年召开物价会议一次，制定全年的物价水平。
    第七、实行外汇分成。为了鼓励地方积极完成国家的出口计划和争取若干工农业产品超额出口，中央将所得外汇，分别给地方一定比例的提成。办法另行通知。
