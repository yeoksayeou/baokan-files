    Thoughts on the Re-release of "Crossroads"	Bai Yang
    The film "Crossroads" has been re-released. Although only twenty-one years have passed since the film was made, in my heart today, it feels like something from a very distant past, truly like another world. In fact, it really is a matter of two different worlds!
    I remember when we were filming this movie—in 1936, I was only sixteen years old, still young; but my heart, compared to my heart now, which grows younger with each passing year, was infinitely heavier. At that time, I was just like some of the young people depicted in the film, wandering about, constantly trapped in feelings of distress and anxiety. Therefore, when I think of this film, I cannot help but recall that era of profound calamity and my own situation at the time. A sixteen-year-old feeling that the burden of life was so heavy—comparing this with the youth of today, it truly is a matter of two different worlds. Today, the days when heavy burdens weighed down young hearts, the nightmare-like days of "unemployment upon graduation," are gone forever. Today, what is displayed before the youth of New China is a bright and splendid future. What is hidden in the chest of every young, healthy person is a heart full of ideals, dedicated to contributing their youth to the motherland. For this, I envy and bless the youth of New China, and at the same time, I rejoice for myself, because I too have obtained a heart that is even younger than when I was sixteen!
    From another perspective, although twenty-one years have passed, some things seem very recent and are becoming increasingly clear. "Crossroads" was filmed by the Second Studio of the Star Film Company. In the same year, the Second Studio also filmed films such as "Street Angel." However, when speaking of the Star Film Company's productions, what came to people's minds at that time was inseparable from supernatural films such as "The Burning of the Red Lotus Temple." Why were some progressive films reflecting reality also produced at that time? The main reason was that the Communist Party of China was mastering and leading them from within. It was precisely because of the Party's strength that such results were produced. What is even more unforgettable for me is that from the moment I started filming "Crossroads" and took my first step on the path of film art, I received the Party's guidance, which made me realize and understand: "Acting must involve making choices. You must be an actor with a soul. Do not film meaningless plays..." These words have always been the standard by which I have strived for many years, and have had an extremely important and beneficial influence on my commitment to film and drama. Today, I feel even more deeply that all work and all individuals, separated from the Party, will achieve nothing. This is the truth! To be determined to thoroughly reform oneself and resolutely follow the Party is the only correct path for an old intellectual.
    Written on the eve of the re-release of "Crossroads," also to commemorate this truth!

### 重映“十字街头”有感

    重映“十字街头”有感	白杨
    影片“十字街头”重映了。这部影片的拍摄，距今虽然只有二十一年；但它在我今天的感情中，仿佛那已是非常遥远的事情，真是恍同隔世。事实上，这也确是两个世界的事情了！
    记得拍摄这部影片的时候——1936年，我只有十六岁，还年轻；可是，我的心，比起现在这越活越年轻的心，不知要沉重多少。当时，我正像影片所表现的一些青年一样，颠沛流离，老是陷于苦闷不安的感情中，因此在想起这部影片的时候，也不禁想起那灾难深重的年代，回想起当时自己的情况。十六岁的人，就感到生活的负担是如此沉重，这和今天的青年对照一下，真是两个世界两回事了。今天，沉重的压着年轻的心的日子，像噩梦一样的“毕业即失业”的日子，是一去不复返了；今天，展示在新中国青年面前的是光辉灿烂的前途，蕴藏在每个年轻健康的胸膛中的，是一颗富于理想、为祖国献出青春的心。我为此羡慕和祝福新中国的青年们，同时也为自己庆幸，因为我也一样获得比自己十六岁时更年轻的心！
    从另一方面说，事情虽已过了二十一年；但有些事，却又仿佛很近，而且越来越清楚。“十字街头”是明星影片公司第二厂拍摄的，同年明星二厂还拍了
  “马路天使”等影片，可是说起明星公司的出品，当时在人们的脑海中，与“火烧红莲寺”等神怪片分不开。为什么那时竟也出了一些反映现实的进步影片？主要原因，就是由于中国共产党从中加以掌握和领导。正是有了党的力量，才产生了这样的结果。更使我难忘的是，从我拍摄“十字街头”、在电影艺术的途程上迈开第一步时起，就得到了党的教导，使我认识到和体会到：“演戏必须要有选择，要做个有灵魂的演员，不要拍没有意义的戏……”这样的话，始终成为我若干年来努力的指标，对我坚持从事电影戏剧，有着极其重大的和有益的影响。今天，我更加深切地感到：一切工作，一切个人，离开了党，就会一无成就，这是真理！决心彻底改造自己，坚决跟着党走，这是一个旧知识分子的唯一正确的道路。
    谨写在“十字街头”重映前，也是为的纪念这条真理！
