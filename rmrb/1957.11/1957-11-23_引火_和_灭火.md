    "Igniting Fire" and "Extinguishing Fire"
    Xing Huan
    As the old saying goes, "Bitter medicine is good for illness, and honest advice is unpleasant to the ear but beneficial to conduct." We Communists have recognized this truth from our own practice. Therefore, we have always adopted a welcoming attitude towards criticism from the masses. However, there are also individual Communist Party members who, when presented with bitter but beneficial medicine, would rather be plagued by illness than swallow it. Even though the masses offer them beneficial and honest advice, they cover their ears and refuse to listen, even becoming "angry" upon hearing criticism. Here are two readily available examples of such people.
    One example is Sun Baoming, the Chief of the Technical Division of the Technology Department of the Ministry of Light Industry and a Communist Party member. He is usually irresponsible in his work, and Party members and the masses have criticized him, but he remains unmoved and does not change at all. Recently, during the rectification stage, the masses raised many criticisms about his bourgeois ideology and work style. Not only did he not humbly accept them, but he also prevented the masses from criticizing him. A few days ago, Engineer Xu of the same division wrote a big-character poster criticizing Sun Baoming for being irresponsible regarding the 1958 technical plan. After writing it, he showed it to Sun Baoming, who was very dissatisfied and said it "contains discrepancies" and "does not conform to the facts." This caused Engineer Xu to be afraid to post the big-character poster at that time.
    The second example is Li Zhengyi, the Secretary of the General Office of the Shanxi Provincial Department of Transportation. As a member of the Party Leadership Group, a member of the Party Committee, the Secretary of the Party Branch of the office, and a member of the Rectification Leadership Group of the Transportation Department, he not only failed to take all measures to encourage the masses to speak out freely during the rectification movement, but on the contrary, whenever someone criticized him, he would hold individual talks with them, blocking avenues for free expression. After Li Jing and Luo Wei, employees of the Highway Bureau, criticized him, he even threatened and suppressed the critics and even attempted retaliation. Not only that, when the leaders of the Transportation Department accepted the correct opinions of the masses and decided to correct the unreasonable salary and benefits of his wife, Wu Linxiang, Li Zhengyi repeatedly obstructed the progress of this work.
    Li Zhengyi's and Sun Baoming's behavior is extremely bad. They have neither achieved "joy upon hearing criticism" nor welcomed criticism from the masses, nor have they "invited fire to burn themselves" by actively seeking to guide the masses to criticize them. "Inviting fire to burn oneself" is precisely what the Party requires of every leading cadre in this rectification movement. Why "invite fire"? Because spontaneous criticism from the masses alone may not be enough to reveal all the shortcomings in our work and style. Only by automatically "inviting fire" can the masses see the leadership's determination to rectify, will they speak out freely without reservation, expressing their opinions and criticisms of the leadership, and saying everything they want to say. Only by thoroughly exposing shortcomings and errors can we thoroughly eliminate shortcomings and errors. Just like a patient who can only seek a complete cure by telling the doctor the full extent of their illness without any concealment. If one covers up their boils like Ah Q, they will only ever be a "scabby head."
    Many of our leading cadres are treating this rectification movement with the mentality of "seeking medical treatment after a long illness." Therefore, they not only welcome spontaneous criticism from the masses but also try every means to guide the flames of mass criticism onto themselves. They know that the hotter and fiercer the fire burns, the cleaner the impurities (problems) on their bodies will be burned away, and they will become purer and stronger under the refining of the fire. Only then can they do more and better work. The practices of these comrades are worthy of praise, and they are worthy of the glorious title of Communist Party members. And those who are afraid of criticism from the masses, tremble in the face of the fire, and even try to extinguish the fire, will inevitably be severely condemned by the Party and the masses!

    “引火”和“灭火”
    星环
    古语说：“良药苦口利于病，忠言逆耳利于行”，我们共产党人从自己的实践中认识了这个真理，因此，对群众的批评一向就采取欢迎的态度。但是，也有个别的共产党员，当苦口的良药摆在他们面前的时候，他们宁可让疾病缠身也不愿吞服，尽管群众提出的是对他们有益的忠言，他们也把耳朵掩起来而不愿意听，甚至闻过则“怒”。这样的人手边就有两个现成的例证。
    例子之一，中央轻工业部技术司技术处处长、共产党员孙宝明，平时工作不负责任，党内外群众都曾对他提出过批评，但他无动于中，根本不改。最近整改阶段中，群众又对他的资产阶级思想和工作作风提出不少批评，他不但不虚心接受，反而阻止群众对他的批评。前几天这个司的徐工程师写了一篇批评孙宝明对1958年技术规划不负责任的大字报，写好以后，给孙宝明看了一下，孙宝明表现很不满意，说“有出入”“不符合事实”。弄得徐工程师当时就没敢把大字报贴出去。
    例子之二，山西省交通厅秘书主任李正一，身为交通厅党组成员、党委委员、机关党支部书记、整风领导小组成员，在整风中不但没有采取一切措施鼓励群众鸣放，相反地，只要谁对他提出批评，他就找谁个别谈话，阻塞言路。当公路局职工李静、罗伟对他提出批评后，他竟对批评者进行威胁、压制，甚至企图报复。不仅如此，当交通厅领导上接受群众正确的意见，决定纠正他爱人武林香不合理的工资待遇时，李正一还一再阻挠这一工作的进行。
    李正一、孙宝明这种行为十分恶劣，他们既没有做到“闻过则喜”，对群众的批评表示欢迎，更没有做到“引火烧身”，主动设法引导群众对自己开展批评。而“引火烧身”正是党在这次整风运动中对每个党员领导干部的要求。为什么要“引火”？因为光是群众自发的批评，还不可能把我们工作中、作风上的缺点揭露无遗，只有自动地“引火”，才可以使群众看到领导整改的决心，才会毫无保留地大鸣大放，把自己对领导的意见和批评，把心里想说的话一起说出来。也只有彻底地揭露缺点和错误，才能够彻底地消除缺点和错误。正如同一个病人，只有把全部病情毫无隐讳地告诉医生，才能求得彻底的根治一样。如果像阿Q一样掩盖自己的癞疮，就只能永远是一个“癞痢头”。
    我们许许多多的领导干部，正是带着“久病求医”的心情来对待这次整风运动的，因此，他们不仅欢迎群众自发的批评，而且想尽一切方法，把群众批评的火焰引导到自己的身上。他们知道，火愈烧得炽热、猛烈，自己身上的杂质（毛病）就愈烧得干净，自己才会在火的冶炼下变得更纯正更坚实，才能把工作做得更多更好，这些同志的做法是值得赞扬的，他们无愧于共产党员的光荣称号。而那些害怕群众的批评，在火的面前发抖、甚至企图灭火的人，必然要受到党和群众严厉的谴责！（附图片）
