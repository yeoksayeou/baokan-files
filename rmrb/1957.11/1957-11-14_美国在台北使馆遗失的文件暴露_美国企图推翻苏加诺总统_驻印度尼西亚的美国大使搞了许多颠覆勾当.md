Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, November 13th: The Indian magazine "Blitz" recently published some documents lost by the US Embassy in Taipei during the anti-American demonstrations in Taipei in May, revealing the US conspiracy to overthrow President Sukarno.

The published documents are copies of two telegrams from US Ambassador to Indonesia, Allison, to the US State Department, with copies sent to the US Embassy in Taipei.

Allison's telegram No. 473, dated March 18th, stated: "The leaders of the Masyumi Party have reiterated the need to increase military assistance to the troops of the Islamic State Movement and the Indonesian Islamic Army currently operating in Sumatra, West Java, and other parts of Indonesia. Due to the severely deteriorating situation of these troops, they request that this assistance not be limited to transporting weapons and ammunition, and suggest deploying troops from Taiwan to help the Islamic State Movement's troops."

Allison asked in the telegram: "Can our ambassador in Taipei determine whether it is possible to expect a favorable decision on this matter?"

Allison's telegram No. 490, dated March 26, 1957, stated, "The leaders of the Masyumi Party have taken further measures to deepen this political crisis. With the support of a person you already know, Natsir was able to have his party's central executive committee definitively refuse to participate in the new government. Sjahrir has guaranteed that the Indonesian Socialist Party will provide full support to the Masyumi Party in both overthrowing the Indonesian Nationalist Party and establishing a new government controlled by the Masyumi Party and their supporters, as well as in actions taken to undermine Sukarno's reputation. As previously reported, a joint consultative committee will be established in Jakarta in the near future to unify and coordinate these efforts. This committee will include representatives from the central executive committees of the Indonesian Socialist Party and the Masyumi Party."

Allison further stated in this telegram that Sjahrir, with the help of his agents in the armed forces, would be able to gain control of the army and replace Nasution. He said it was suggested that Simbolon be appointed Deputy Chief of Staff.

He said, "I believe that assistance to these military committees in Sumatra must be increased through existing channels. In the event that the Masyumi Party fails to seize power, a Sumatran government can be formed, which will then sever relations with the central government. The person you know will, on my recommendation, go to Sumatra next month to establish personal contact with the leaders of the Islamic State Movement and the Indonesian Islamic Army, as well as the Eagle Committee and the Wild Bull Division Committee. He has been given additional funds to carry out this work."

Allison concluded in this telegram, "Please inform the relevant parties that the leaders of the Islamic State Movement require that the weapons shipped to them from Taiwan and Malaya must absolutely not bear any trademarks and must be placed in containers typically used to load agricultural machinery, textiles, canned food, and the like."

    美国在台北使馆遗失的文件暴露
    美国企图推翻苏加诺总统
    驻印度尼西亚的美国大使搞了许多颠覆勾当
    据新华社新德里13日电　印度
  “闪电”周刊最近刊载一些台北美国大使馆在5月间台北反美示威中遗失的文件，揭露美国阴谋推翻苏加诺总统。
    刊载的文件是美国驻印度尼西亚大使艾利逊致美国国务院的两份电报的副本，副本是拍给台北美国大使馆的。
    艾利逊在3月18日发出的第四百七十三号电报写道：“马斯友美党领袖们再度坚持有必要增加对于目前在苏门答腊、西爪哇和印度尼西亚其他地方活动的伊斯兰教国运动的军队和印度尼西亚伊斯兰教军的军队的军事援助。由于这些军队的处境严重恶化，他们要求不应该把这种援助限于运输武器和军火，并且建议从台湾调派部队来帮助伊斯兰教国运动的军队。”
    艾利逊在电报中问道：“我们的驻台北大使能否确定是否可能指望在这个问题上作出一个赞成的决定？”
    艾利逊在1957年3月26日发出的第四百九十号电报说，“马斯友美党的领袖们已经采取了另外的措施来加深这次政治危机。在你们已经知道的一个人的支持下，纳席尔能够使他的党的中央执行委员会肯定地拒绝参加新政府。沙利尔已经保证，印度尼西亚社会党在推翻印度尼西亚国民党和成立一个由马斯友美党和他们的支持者控制的新政府这两方面以及在破坏苏加诺的名誉所采取的行动方面，都将给予马斯友美党以充分的支持。前已报告，在最近的将来在雅加达将设立一个联合协商委员会以使这些努力得到统一和配合。这个委员会将包括印度尼西亚社会党和马斯友美党的中央执行委员会的代表。”
    艾利逊在这份电报中又说，沙利尔在他在武装部队中的代理人的帮助下将能够取得对陆军的控制权，并且撤换纳苏蒂安。他说，有人建议要西姆波朗担任副参谋长。
    他说，“我认为，对于苏门答腊的这些军事委员会的援助必须通过现有的途径予以增加。万一马斯友美党夺取权力失败，可以组成一个苏门答腊政府，它那时将同中央政府断绝关系。你们所知道的那个人将在我的建议下在下月到苏门答腊去同伊斯兰教国运动和印度尼西亚伊斯兰教军的军队以及鹰委员会和雄牛师委员会的领袖建立个人联系。已经另外给他以进行这项工作的经费。”
    艾利逊在这份电报中最后说，“请转告有关方面，伊斯兰教国运动的领袖们要求，从台湾和马来亚运给他们的武器绝对不可以带有商标，并且要放在当地用来装载农业机器、纺织品、罐头食品等一类的容器里面。”
