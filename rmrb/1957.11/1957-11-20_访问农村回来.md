    Returning from a Visit to the Countryside
      Stone Jingshan Power Plant Worker Zhao Shuanzhuang
      (The Beijing Shijingshan Power Plant organized workers to visit the countryside to deepen the rectification and great debate. This visit was to the old revolutionary base area of Xushui County, Hebei Province. The village visited has a middle-class standard of living. - Editor)
    After returning from my visit to the countryside, I felt that the peasants' awareness is quite high. For example, the average peasant in Wanggezhuang village participated in the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation, personally taking up guns and fighting the enemy, risking their lives, and contributing to the people of the whole country. But they are not satisfied with their own merits, do not ask the government for special care, do not make trouble about living standards, have no emotions, and have no complaints, and continue to struggle hard to build socialism. The glorious tradition of the old revolutionary base area has been preserved. Some of us feel great just because we have a little bit of skill, and become complacent. Some young people look down on veteran workers, make trouble about wages, and talk about welfare. We really should correct our non-working-class thoughts.
    We participated in the peasants' debate on "Is 320 catties of grain enough to eat?" The debate was very intense. Many peasants said, "Don't even mention 320 catties, who could even eat 100 catties in the past? In the past, the blessed were always blessed, and the suffering were always suffering. Now, we share blessings and hardships together, and no one oppresses anyone anymore. Our living standards have improved many times. Although what we eat is not good enough at the moment, it is because we are building socialism." We were truly educated when we heard this sentence.
    When we went there to hold the worker-peasant alliance meeting, there was no large auditorium. It was held in the courtyard. The peasants again got up early and went to bed late, but many people attended. Looking at us, we only work eight hours a day, the environment is so good, and some people are unwilling to be educated and unwilling to attend meetings. The political sentiments of these people are far behind those of the peasants.
    The peasants also have a strong sense of the state. They pick the best grain to deliver as public grain. However, some of us don't seem to care about how the state plan is being completed, as if it has nothing to do with them.
    The peasants also have a plan for their lives. When they are busy, they eat better, and when they are not busy, they eat thin porridge, with sweet potato leaves added. But some of us buy anything when we get paid, without any planning. My own life has not been frugal in recent years. I don't like to eat vegetables without meat. The best vegetable for the peasants is string beans. Thinking about what we should do to be worthy of being the leading class.

### 访问农村回来

    访问农村回来
      石景山发电厂工人　赵拴庄
      （北京石景山发电厂为了使整风大
  辩论更深入，组织工人到农村访问。这
  次访问，是访老根据地河北徐水县。所
  访的村子生活水平在中等。——编者）
    从农村访问回来，我感觉农民觉悟相当高。如王各庄村一般农民都参加过抗日战争、解放战争，亲自拿枪杆和敌人打过仗，拿生命干过，对全国人民有贡献。但他们没有因自己功劳而满足，没要求政府照顾，没有闹生活待遇，没有情绪，没有什么怨言，继续在艰苦奋斗，建设社会主义。老根据地的光荣传统保留下来了。我们有些人有点技术就觉着了不起了，满足了，有些青年人瞧不起老师傅，闹工资，讲福利，真是应该好好改掉自己的非工人阶级思想。
    我们参加这一次农民的辩论会，辩论“三百二十斤粮食够吃不够吃？”辩论的很激烈，好多农民说：“甭说三百二十斤，就是一百斤过去谁吃的上呢？过去是享福的老享福，受苦的老受苦，现在是有福同享，有苦同当，没有人压迫人了。现在生活提高了多少倍，眼下吃的虽还不够好，是因为我们要建设社会主义。”这句话我们听了真受教育。
    我们到那开工农联盟大会，没有什么大礼堂，就是在院子里开的，农民又是起早睡晚，但是人去的很多，再看看咱们，一天才干八小时，环境这么好，有人还不愿意受教育，不愿意参加会，这些人的政治情绪和农民差远了。
    农民的国家观念也很强，交公粮都挑好的送，可是我们有些人对待国家计划完成的怎么样，好像和他没关系似的，一点也不关心。
    农民过日子也有计划，活忙的时候吃好点，不忙了就吃稀的，加上白薯叶，可我们有些人开了支有了钱什么都买，一点计划也没有，我自己这几年生活也不俭朴了，菜里没肉就不爱吃，人家农民最好的菜是豆角。想想咱们应该怎样，才能不愧做领导阶级。
