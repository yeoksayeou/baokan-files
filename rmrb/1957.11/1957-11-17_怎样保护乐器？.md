    How to Protect Musical Instruments?
    Musical instruments should not be placed in places that are too cold, too hot, too humid, or too dry. Drastic temperature changes are particularly harmful to musical instruments. To better protect pianos, in winter, do not place them against the wall facing the street, but against an interior wall, one and a half to two meters away from windows and heating pipes. In summer, do not expose the piano to sunlight or drafts.
    Dust can also have a destructive effect on musical instruments. It corrodes the luster of the wood and, when it penetrates the interior, it can worsen the tone. Therefore, pianos should be covered when not in use, and a piece of flannel should be placed on the keyboard.
    Accordions, guitars, zithers, etc., are also very sensitive to temperature changes, humidity, and dust. These instruments should be kept in cases or covered with thick cloth covers and placed in dry, warm rooms. When taking musical instruments out on the street, they must be placed in cases (or covers), especially in winter. When you arrive in a warm place, do not immediately take the instrument out and wipe it. Do not tune the instrument until it is dry.

    怎样保护乐器？
    乐器不宜放在过冷、过热、过于潮湿或干燥的地方。因为温度的剧烈变化，对于乐器特别有害。为了更好地保护钢琴，冬天不要把它放在靠街的墙跟前，而要放在内墙跟前，离窗口和暖气管一公尺半到两公尺远的地方。夏天不让钢琴受到阳光晒和穿堂风吹。
    灰尘对乐器也能发生破坏作用。它腐蚀木质上的光泽，侵入内部会使音调变坏。所以钢琴在不用的时候应该盖起来，并在键盘上垫上绒布。
    手风琴、吉他琴、三角琴等，对于温度变化、潮湿和灰尘，也是很敏感的。这些乐器应放在盒子里或套上厚布套子，放在干燥、温暖的房间里。拿着乐器上街，必须放在盒子（或套子）里，特别是冬天。到了温暖的地方，不要立刻把乐器拿出来用布擦。在乐器未干以前，不要调音。
