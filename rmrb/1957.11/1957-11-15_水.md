    Water
    Zhang Laishun
    In the summer of 1952, during a sweltering noon, I arrived at Ganggou Village in the Ma'er Mountain Gorge and stayed at Uncle Zhang's house. Because I was young and naive, when I was throwing stones at a small wild chicken that had entered the house, I accidentally broke the owner's water jar. Water spilled all over the ground. Uncle Zhang's face immediately changed. He looked very angry and seemed to want to say something, but he felt embarrassed to say it because I was a new guest; but if he didn't say it, he felt really uncomfortable in his heart. In the end, he could only sigh repeatedly, "Alas! Alas!..." At this time, his fifteen-year-old daughter, Yunyun, also ran out of the house and complained to me in a shrill voice, "Oh dear! Why are you comrades so..." The words were about to come out, but she swallowed them back. I thought to myself, "A small water jar, worth at most two yuan, and they're making such a fuss." So, I said somewhat unhappily, "It doesn't matter, Uncle, I'll pay you for it." Uncle Zhang, upon hearing my words, quickly explained, "Comrade, what are you saying? I'm not heartbroken about this small water jar; the water jar is nothing, but it's this jar of water..." This was even stranger; a jar of ordinary cool water actually caused such a big commotion.
    Later, I understood.
    It turned out that getting water here was very difficult. In the village—no, not just in the village, but even within twenty *li* outside the village, there were no wells, and there were no rivers or ponds. Therefore, not to mention washing clothes or anything like that, even washing one's face was very difficult. The whole family, no matter how many people there were, would wash with one basin of water. After washing, they would let the water settle and save it for use again the next day. As for drinking water, during the winter when it snowed, they would melt snow water to cook; in the rainy season, they would drink rainwater. Every family had many large water jars. After it rained, they would scoop the muddy rainwater from the ditches and pits into the water jars, then sprinkle grass ash to slowly clarify the water, preparing it for future consumption. Over time, the water would develop a foul odor and taste bad, but people were reluctant to throw it away. In seasons without snow or rain, people had to transport water from the Tang River, which was twenty *li* away. Families with livestock were better off; they could load two wooden buckets and bring back some water. Poor families who couldn't afford livestock had it even harder. A person would carry a small willow jug, get up at dawn and sleep late at night, traveling more than forty *li* of rugged mountain roads, just to carry back a small mouthful of water. Truly, the sweat they shed along the way was several times more than the water they brought back!
    Uncle Zhang's family had neither livestock nor young, strong laborers. The whole family of seven, old and young, relied entirely on Uncle Zhang and his daughter Yunyun, who had just turned fifteen, for everything inside and outside the house. At that time, it was a drought, and the weather was hot and dry, so hot that it was hard to breathe. The rainwater that Uncle Zhang's family had prepared had long been used up. The father and daughter had just returned from working in the fields, their bodies drenched in sweat, and they hadn't even had time to start a fire and cook a meal when the small water jar was broken by me. The Tang River water they had carried back this morning was completely spilled. Not to mention eating, they couldn't even get a sip of cool water.
    "Let's go, Yunzi," Uncle Zhang said, picking up a small willow jug and calling out to his daughter Yunyun. As soon as I saw this, I understood and quickly stopped him, saying, "Uncle, go back after noon! Look at how hot the weather is." He replied helplessly, "What else can we do? If we wait until after noon, not only will we not be able to eat, but we won't be able to work in the afternoon." As he spoke, he shook off my hand and led Yunyun, carrying the small willow jug, bowing their backs and walking into the fiery, scorching sunlight. Watching the receding figures of Uncle Zhang and Yunyun, I shed tears of sorrow and remorse.
    I wiped away my tears and asked Yunyun's grandmother, "Why don't you dig a well? Is there no water source here?" The old woman replied, "Water springs, yes, there are, but they're too deep. You have to dig dozens of *zhang* through rock to find water. Small households in the mountain gullies, where would they get the strength to dig so much!"
    Five years later, when I came here again, I could hardly recognize this mountain village. The original thatched huts and low earthen caves had been replaced by rows of new brick houses. The mountain slopes that used to be covered only with weeds now had orchards everywhere. Fist-sized peaches and pears gleamed golden among the dense foliage. Herds of cattle and sheep grazed on the tender water plants and drank freely from the streams flowing down from the valleys. At the time, I really suspected that I had taken the wrong road. But it was definitely right; the highest mountain in front of me was indeed the twin peaks of Ma'er Mountain, wasn't it? How could it be wrong! However, what was going on? The village had changed completely from how it used to be. Just then, a person emerged from the fruit trees by the roadside. It was a pretty young woman of about twenty years old. I quickly asked, "Excuse me, is this village Ganggou Village?" The girl was very happy when she first came out, her face full of smiles, but after I asked her this, she got angry. She pouted her lips, twisted her neck, and said angrily, "I don't know, go ask someone else!" Saying that, she disappeared into the orchard. In that instant, I recognized her: this girl was none other than Yunyun, whom I had met five years ago. I hurried after her and shouted loudly, "Yunyun! Yunyun!" When she turned around and recognized me, she laughed so hard that she couldn't stand up straight: "Oh my, it's Comrade Zhang! Hehehe..."
    She laughed for a long time before saying, "Our village name has been changed. It's no longer called that stinky Ganggou Village. Now it's called Shuangfengyu (Twin Peaks Valley)." As she spoke, she glanced at the high twin peaks of Ma'er Mountain. Only then did I understand that the words "Ganggou" (Dry Gulch) had annoyed her. While stuffing peaches into my hands, she continued, "This isn't the 'Dry Gulch' you came to in the past anymore. Now we have established an advanced cooperative, and the government has given us loans to carry out water conservancy construction. Through the collective efforts of the cooperative members, we have built many reservoirs, and we have also dug two wells in the village, with plenty of water. Come on, I'll take you to see them."
    I followed Yunyun, observing the scenery along the way. The mountains were full of exotic flowers and herbs, orchards, and newly built farmhouses, all bathed in sunlight, looking very vibrant. Small reservoirs had been built in all the mountain gullies. The rice seedlings in the terraced fields were lush and green, promising a bountiful harvest. I don't know what kind of birds were chirping in the orchards, their voices so melodious, as if singing: "Harvest, harvest, harvest, happiness, happiness, harvest, abundant crops."
    I followed Yunyun for a while, and when we arrived at the well, Yunyun found a small iron bucket to draw water from the well. I stepped forward to take a look. Wow! What a deep well! It was at least twenty *zhang* deep. Twenty *zhang* of solid bluestone, it must have been really difficult to dig a well. Yunyun quickly said, "The stone is so hard, how could we dig it down? It was all blasted with yellow dynamite. If we hadn't joined the advanced cooperative and taken the socialist road, who would have had such great strength!"
    She drew up a bucket of cool, clear well water and said with a smile, "Try it, Comrade Zhang. This water is sweet, like honey, hundreds of times better than the water from the Tang River."
    I drank a mouthful of the well water from Ganggou Village—oh, no, not Ganggou Village, Shuangfengyu Village—and for some reason, I suddenly remembered the story of breaking the water jar at Yunyun's house five years ago. At this moment, my heart couldn't help but beat faster again. (Attached picture)

    水
    张来顺
    1952年夏天，一个闷热闷热的中午，我来到马耳山峡的干沟庄，住在张大伯家里。因为自己年轻幼稚，在用石块投掷一只进宅的小野鸡的时候，不小心，把主人的水缸砸碎了。水，倾了满地。张大伯的脸色立刻变了，看样子，他很气愤，想说些什么，又觉得我是新来的客人，不好意思说出口来；不说吧，心中又实在难受；最后，只得连声叹息：“唉！唉！……”这时，他十五岁的女儿云云也从屋里跑出来，对我埋怨地尖声叫道：“哎呀呀！你同志怎么这么……”后面的话刚要出口，但又咽回去了。我心中想：一个不大点的水缸，满顶不值两元钱，就这么大惊小怪的嚷嚷。”于是，我有些不愉快的说：“不要紧，大伯，我赔你们钱好了。”大伯听了我的话，连忙解释说：“同志，你说的哪里的话，我不是心痛这个小水缸；水缸，算不了什么，可就是这缸水……”这就更奇怪了，一缸普普通通的凉水，竟引起了这么大的风波。
    后来，我才闹明白了。
    原来，这里吃水非常困难。村子里——不，不是村子里，就连村外二十华里以内的地方都没有水井，又没有河流池泽，因此，甭说洗衣服什么的，就是洗脸水也是很艰苦的，全家无论有多少人都是洗一盆水，洗完了，把水澄一澄搁着待明天还用它。就按吃水来说吧，在冬天落雪的时候，他们都是化雪水作饭；雨季里，便吃雨水。每家都有很多大水缸，下过雨之后，把沟坑里混浊的雨水一瓢一瓢地舀进水缸中去，然后撒上草灰，慢慢地把水澄清，准备将来食用。日久天长，水就生了臭味，很不好吃，但人们也舍不得把它扔掉。在无雪无雨的季节里，人们只有到二十里外的唐河里去运水了。有牲口的人家还好些，驮上两个木桶，总可以驮回一些水来。养不起牲口的贫穷人家可就更困难了。一个人背着个小小的柳罐斗，起五更睡半夜，往返四十多里崎岖不平的山路，才能背回一小口口水来。真是，一路上流的汗比背回来的这点水要多几倍啊！
    张大伯家既没牲口，也没有年轻力壮的劳力，全家七口人，老的老，小的小，里里外外全靠张大伯和他那刚满十五岁的女儿云云操劳。那时，正是旱天，天气燥热，热得喘不过气来。张大伯家准备下的雨水早吃光了。父女俩刚从田里劳作回来，混身淌着汗水还没顾得生火作饭，小水缸却被我打碎了。今早背来的唐河水撒了个一干二净。甭说吃饭，他们连口凉水也喝不上了。
      “走吧，云子。”张大伯背起一个小柳罐斗儿，唤叫着女儿云云。我一看就明白了，就忙拦住他说：“大伯，过了晌再去背吧！你看天气这么炎热。”他无可奈何地回答道：“那有什么办法儿，要等起晌再去，吃不上饭先甭说，下午也就甭想干活了。”他说着挣脱了我的手，领着云云，背着小柳罐斗，弓着腰走进火一般烤人的阳光中去了。我看着张大伯和云云远去的背影，掉下了心酸和自悔的眼泪。
    我擦干了泪水，问云云的老奶奶：“怎么你们不打井呢？这里没有水源吗？”老人回答道：“水泉，有倒是有，就是太深，得挖几十丈石头才能见水。山沟里的小户人家，哪里有那么大腰劲挖呀！”
    五年后的今天，当我又来到这里的时候，简直不敢认这个山村了。原来的茅舍和低矮的土洞洞都变成了一排排新砖房，过去只长杂草的山坡，出现了一片一片的果树林，拳头大小的蜜桃和梨儿在浓密的枝叶间泛着金光，一群群的牛羊吃着青嫩的水草，畅饮着从山谷中流下来的溪水……。当时，我真怀疑是走错了路。可是，明明又不错呀，眼前最高的山不正是马耳山双峰吗？怎么会错呢！然而，这又是怎么回事儿？村庄变得一点也不像过去啦。正在这时，恰好从路旁果树丛中钻出一个人来，是一个二十岁左右的、漂亮的青年姑娘，我赶忙问道：“喂！借光喽，这个村子是不是干沟庄？”那姑娘刚出来时很高兴，满面堆着笑容，可是，经我这么一问，她可就火了，把嘴一噘，把脖子一扭，生气地说：“不知道，你问别人去吧！”说着，钻进果园中去了。就在这一刹那间，我看出来了：这姑娘不是别人，正是我五年前认识的云云。我匆匆赶上去，大声叫道：“云云！云云——！”当她转回身来，也认出我来之后，她笑得直不起腰来了：“哎哟，敢情是张同志呀，咯咯咯……”
    她笑了大半天，才说：“我们的村名改了，不叫那个臭干沟庄了，现在叫双峰峪。”说着，还瞟了一眼高高的马耳山双峰。这我才明白：刚才是“干沟”两个字惹恼了她。她一边向我手里塞着蜜桃，一边接着说：“这不是你过去来的那个‘干沟儿’了，现在办了高级社，政府贷给我们款子，叫搞水利建设，经过社员们起群搭伙地努力，修了很多蓄水池，村中也打了两眼井，水可旺哩。走，我领你们看看去。”
    我跟着云云，一面走，一面观望路旁的景色。满山遍野的奇花异草，果树林，新盖的农舍，沐浴在阳光中，显得很有生气；那条条的山沟里都修上了小水库。梯田里的禾苗绿油油的，孕育着丰收。不知什么鸟儿在果树林里鸣叫，声音是那么婉转中听，好像在唱：“丰收，丰收丰收，幸福幸福，丰收，五谷丰登。”
    我跟着云云走了一段路，当我们来到井边时，云云就寻来个小铁桶，去井里提水。我上前一看，吓！好深的井啊，足有二十丈深。二十丈净是大青石，打一眼井真不容易呀。云云忙说：“石头这么坚硬，打哪能打下去呢，都是用黄色炸药崩的，要不是入了高级社，走社会主义，谁家有这么大力量！”
    她提上来一桶清凉清凉的井水，笑道：“你尝尝，张同志，这水可甜丝丝的哩，像蜜汁一样，比唐河里的水好几百倍。”
    我喝了一口干沟庄——呵，不，不是干沟庄，是双峰峪村——的井水，不知为什么，忽然又想起五年前在云云家打破水缸的那个故事来，这时，我的心禁不住又波波地跳起来了。（附图片）
