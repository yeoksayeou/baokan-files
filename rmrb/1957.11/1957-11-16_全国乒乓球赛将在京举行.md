Xinhua News Agency, 15th: The annual National Table Tennis Championships will begin on the 17th at the Beijing Gymnasium. This is the largest National Table Tennis Championship in terms of scale and number of events in recent years.

　　The two hundred and fifty-two male and female athletes from thirty-one delegations participating in this championship were selected from twenty-seven provinces, cities, and autonomous regions. More than fifty of the athletes are under twenty years old; Guo Zhongtai, the Tianjin Men's Singles Champion, and Gu Qingcui, the Anhui Women's Singles Champion, are both only fifteen years old.

　　Currently, the athletes from each unit participating in this championship are actively practicing at the Beijing Gymnasium to prepare for this tense eleven-day battle.

　　According to the person in charge of the competition organization office, judging from these few days of practice, each team has its own strengths in terms of technology and tactics. It is expected that the matches between the strongest teams, Beijing First Team, Guangzhou First Team, and Shanghai Team, will be the most eye-catching.

　　The competition events in this championship include almost all the events in the World Table Tennis Championships. In addition to the men's singles, doubles, and women's singles, doubles competitions, the men's team and women's team competitions, as well as mixed doubles competitions, will be held for the first time.

　　The men's and women's team competitions will start first on the 17th. Each team will first conduct a single round-robin within its group, and then the champions of each group will conduct another single round-robin to compete for the national championship. The competitions for the other five events will all adopt the elimination competition method.
