	A Precious Gift
	-- Celebrating the Opening of the Soviet Film Week
	Si Tu Huimin, Vice Chairman of the All-China Film Workers Association

	During the grand festival celebrating the 40th anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution, our capital and major cities will hold a Soviet Film Week, screening excellent Soviet films such as "Prelude to Revolution," "Whirlwind of Hatred," "Pavel Korchagin," and "Vocation." The screening of these films not only adds to the festive atmosphere but is also a precious gift from the Soviet people to the Chinese people, conveying their forty years of arduous and glorious life and struggle through the visual art of film. It is also a precious gift from Soviet film artists to the Chinese people, created with their outstanding talents and love for their socialist motherland.
	The films screened during the Film Week include: "Prelude to Revolution," which depicts the Russian Revolution of 1905; "Whirlwind of Hatred," which describes the conspiracies of foreign imperialists and domestic class enemies in the early years of the Soviet regime, as well as the revolutionary martyrs' and the masses' enthusiasm for defending the Soviet motherland; "Pavel Korchagin," which reflects the selfless labor of heroes during the extremely difficult years of socialist construction through the life story of the protagonist, Pavel; and "Vocation," which depicts the healthy growth and happy lives of the younger generation in a socialist country. These films comprehensively reflect the Soviet people's arduous and glorious forty years of struggle. This is of great significance to the Chinese people who are engaged in socialist construction, because it points out the road for the Chinese people to advance and inspires and motivates the Chinese people's fighting will and revolutionary enthusiasm!
	From some of the films screened during this Film Week, we can also see a characteristic of Soviet films, that is, they do not avoid depicting some of the shortcomings and difficulties in the process of revolution and construction, but through the depiction of these aspects, they more clearly highlight the Soviet people's fearless spirit of daring to overcome difficulties and defeat difficulties. Therefore, it has a powerful persuasive force and can deeply touch our hearts.
	The Chinese people love Soviet films. This is not only because today we have learned many useful things from many Soviet films and recognized the noble moral qualities of the Soviet people, but also because, as far back as decades ago, when we were still suffering from imperialist aggression and the oppression of reactionary rulers, Soviet films such as "Storm Over Asia," "Golden Mountains," "Life Starts Anew," and "We Are From Kronstadt" gave us great strength and encouragement. The Chinese filmmakers of that time were also inspired and educated by these films. From them, we not only learned how to master film technology and skills, but more importantly, they made us understand that art must be combined with politics, and that we must use film as a weapon to serve the revolutionary cause.
	In recent years, Soviet films have made greater progress and development. The film production has greatly increased, and the quality of the films has also greatly improved. And this year, in celebration of the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution, the Soviet Union has produced more and better films than any previous year, such as "The Sisters," "And Quiet Flows the Don," "1918," "From February to October," "The Communists," "The Cranes Are Flying," etc., and completed the first of the world's newest type of panoramic film "How Vast, My Motherland." Not long ago, I saw "And Quiet Flows the Don" and "The Sisters" in Moscow. They have high achievements in terms of directing art, performance, and technology. These situations fully demonstrate that Soviet film workers are actively working to make the film art garden gain more abundant harvests.
	Let us congratulate the glorious achievements of Soviet film art! Congratulations on the success of the Soviet Film Week!

    珍贵的赠礼
    ——庆祝苏联电影周开幕
    中国电影工作者联谊会副主席　司徒慧敏
    在庆祝十月社会主义革命四十周年的伟大节日里，我国首都和各大城市将举行苏联电影周，公映“革命的前奏”、“仇恨的旋风”、“保尔·柯察金”、“天职”等优秀的苏联影片。这些影片的上映不但增加了节日的喜悦的气氛，同时也是苏联人民将他们四十年艰苦而又光辉的生活与斗争的经验，通过电影这门形象的艺术给予中国人民的珍贵的赠礼，也是苏联电影艺术工作者，以他们出色的才能与热爱社会主义祖国的精神创造出的劳动成果，给予中国人民的珍贵赠礼。
    电影周上映的几部影片：“革命的前奏”表现了1905年的俄国革命；“仇恨的旋风”描述了在苏维埃政权最初年代，外国帝国主义者与国内的阶级敌人的阴谋活动，以及革命先烈与群众为保卫苏维埃祖国的热忱；“保尔·柯察金”通过主角保尔的一生事迹反映了在社会主义建设极端困难的岁月中，英雄们的忘我劳动；“天职”则描述在社会主义国家中，青年一代的茁壮成长与他们的幸福生活。这几部影片概括地反映了苏联人民艰苦而又光荣的战斗的四十年。这对于正在进行社会主义建设的中国人民来说，是极有意义的。因为它指出了中国人民前进的道路，鼓舞和激励了中国人民的斗争意志和战斗热情！
    从这次电影周放映的一些影片中，我们也可以看出苏联影片的一个特点，那就是它并不回避描写在革命与建设过程中的一些缺点和困难，而是通过这方面的描写，更加鲜明地突现出苏维埃人勇于克服困难、战胜困难的大无畏的精神。因此它具有强大的说服力，能够深深地扣动我们的心弦。
    中国人民热爱苏联电影。这不仅由于今天我们从许多苏联影片中学到了很多有益的东西，认识到了苏联人民的崇高的道德品质，而且远在几十年前，当我们还遭受着帝国主义的侵略和反动统治者的压迫的时候，苏联影片“亚洲风云”、“金山”、“生路”、“我们来自喀琅斯塔得”等就曾给了我们极大的力量和鼓舞。而当时的中国的电影工作者，也受到了这些影片的启发和教育。从中我们不仅学习到如何掌握电影的技术和技巧，更重要的是它们使我们懂得了艺术必须与政治结合，我们必须利用电影这一种武器，为革命事业服务。
    近些年来，苏联电影有了更大的进步和发展。影片产量大大增加，影片质量也大大提高了。而在今年在庆祝十月革命四十周年这个年头，苏联更制作出比过去任何一年都更多更好的影片，如“姊妹俩”、“静静的顿河”、“1918年”、“二月到十月”、“共产党人”、“飞鹤”等，并且完成了第一部世界上最新型的全景电影“我们祖国多么辽阔广大”。不久以前，我在莫斯科曾经看到“静静的顿河”和“姊妹俩”，它们无论在导演的艺术处理上、表演上或技术上，都有很高的成就。这些情况充分说明，苏联电影工作者，为了使电影艺术园地里能够获得更加丰盛的收成，正在积极地劳动着、工作着。
    让我们为苏联电影艺术的光辉成就祝贺！为苏联电影周的成功祝贺！
