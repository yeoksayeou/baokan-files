Beijing—"August 1st" team draws with "First Machine" team, Beijing team beats Shenyang Military Region team
Tianjin—Changchun team beats Locomotive team, Tianjin team beats Shenyang Institute of Physical Education team
(Our dispatch) The National Football League Division A Beijing competition zone held two matches on the afternoon of the 13th. In a match held at the Beijing Gymnasium football field, the "August 1st" team and the "First Machine" team shook hands and made peace at zero to zero; in a match held at the Xian Nong Tan Stadium, the Beijing team defeated the Shenyang Military Region team six to zero.
　　The lineup of the "August 1st" team in this game was slightly changed compared to previous days, with Xing Guifu taking the lead as center forward, and the original center forward Zhou Xing changed to playing forward, preparing to strengthen the attack and defeat the enemy in one fell swoop. However, the situation after the start of the game was quite the opposite. The "First Machine" team took advantage of the favorable wind conditions and organized many rapid and fierce attacks. Fortunately, the "August 1st" team relied on center back Gao Jun's left and right blocking and goalkeeper Huang Zhaowen's desperate saves to avoid the fall of their city gate.
　　In the second half, the "August 1st" team took advantage of the wind to counterattack, the forwards kicked fast and ran a lot, and the two wings also appeared more active. With the active assists of forwards Zhou Xing and Ren Bin, the forwards inserted into the opponent's penalty area and carried out multiple shots, but because they kicked too softly and shot too straight, they were saved by the opponent's goalkeeper. On the basis of strengthening defense, the "First Machine" team also organized many counterattacks. Wang Liwei dribbled the ball to the front of the goal several times, but because he was an isolated army going deep into the enemy, he was outnumbered and cleared by the "August 1st" team's defender. In the end, the two sides shook hands and made peace at zero to zero.
　　The game between the Beijing team and the Shenyang Military Region team was characterized by: the Shenyang Military Region team's forwards blindly passing the ball and advancing alone, and at the same time, the three defenders had errors in their standing positions, with the left and right defenders standing too far forward, forming two extra-large gaps between them and the center back; in contrast, the Beijing team not only passed the ball accurately and cooperated closely, but also had active forwards, and they organized their attack very successfully through the two wingers who crisscrossed each other. As a result of the game, the Beijing team won six goals against the Shenyang Military Region team.
　　In Tianjin, the Changchun football team defeated the China Locomotive Sports Association team three to two; the Tianjin team defeated the Shenyang Institute of Physical Education team eight to one.

    十三日京津两赛区足球甲级队联赛情况
    北京——“八一”队与“一机”队踢成平局，北京队胜沈阳部队队
    天津——长春队胜火车头队，天津队胜沈阳体育学院队
    本报讯　全国足球队甲级联赛北京竞赛区在13日下午举行了两场比赛。在北京体育馆足球场举行的一场比赛中，“八一”队与“一机”队以零比零握手言和；在先农坛体育场举行的比赛中，北京队以六比零胜沈阳部队队。
    “八一”队在这场比赛中上场的阵容较往日稍有改动，以邢桂福挂帅任中锋，原中锋周兴改踢前卫，准备加强进攻，一举克敌。但比赛开始后的情况恰恰相反，“一机”队借顺风的有利条件，组织了多次快速的猛攻。“八一”队幸赖中卫高筠时左遮右挡，守门员黄肇文奋身抢救，才免于城门失陷。
    下半时“八一”队顺风反攻，前锋出脚快，跑动多，两翼也显得较为活跃，在前卫周兴、任彬的积极助攻下，前锋插在对方禁区内进行了多次的射门，但因踢得太软和射得太正，被对方守门员扑出。“一机”队在加强防守的基础上，也曾多次组织了反攻，王立惟曾几次带球到门前，但因孤军深入寡不敌众，而被“八一”队后卫解围。最后，双方以零比零握手言欢。
    北京队和沈阳部队队的一场比赛，特点是：沈阳部队队前锋盲目传球、单人冒进，同时三个后卫站法有错误，左右后卫站得过前，和中卫之间形成了两个特大的空档；与此相反，北京队不但传球准确、配合紧密，而且前锋活跃，他们通过两个穿来插去的边锋，非常成功地组织了进攻。比赛结果，北京队净赢了沈阳部队队六个球。
    在天津，长春足球队以三比二战胜了中国火车头体育协会队；天津队以八比一战胜了沈阳体育学院队。
