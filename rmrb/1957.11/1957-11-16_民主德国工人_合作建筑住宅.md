Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 15th - In East Germany, there are now 560 workers' housing construction cooperatives, with a total membership of more than 56,000.

This was announced by Bombach, Secretary of the Free German Trade Union Federation, in the "Forum" newspaper on the 14th. He also said that in the first half of this year alone, the number of cooperatives increased by 120, and the number of members increased by more than 19,000. This demonstrates the workers' understanding of the difficulties in solving housing problems and their willingness to make their own contributions in this regard.

Bombach continued: Cooperative housing already accounts for 20% of the newly built housing this year, and this proportion will further increase in the future. Workers will make a significant contribution to the task proposed by the German Socialist Unity Party of more than doubling the residential area during the second five-year (1956-60) plan.

    合作建筑住宅
    新华社柏林15日电　民主德国现在已经有五百六十个工人住宅建筑合作社，参加合作社的成员总共达到五万六千多人。
    这是自由德国工会联合会书记邦巴赫14日在“论坛报”上宣布的。他还说：仅在今年上半年，合作社的数目就增加了一百二十个，社员的人数增加了一万九千多个。这表现了工人谅解解决住宅的困难以及他们准备在这方面作出他们自己的贡献。
    邦巴赫接着说：在今年新建成的住宅中，合作住宅已经占到20％，今后这个比例还将进一步增加。工人将在完成德国统一社会党提出的要在第二个五年（1956—60年）计划期间把居民住宅面积增加一倍多的任务中作出巨大贡献。
