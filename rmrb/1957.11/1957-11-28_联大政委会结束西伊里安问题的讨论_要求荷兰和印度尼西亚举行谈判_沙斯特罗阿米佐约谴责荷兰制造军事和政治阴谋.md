Xinhua News Agency, November 27th, New York: The United Nations General Assembly Political Committee concluded its debate on the West Irian issue on the 26th. The meeting finally adopted a proposal jointly put forward by eighteen Asian-African countries, including Ceylon, and Bolivia in Latin America. This proposal requests the Netherlands and Indonesia to resume negotiations on the West Irian issue and instructs UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld to provide assistance.

The vote on this proposal resulted in forty-two votes in favor, twenty-eight votes against, and eleven abstentions. Among the countries that voted against were the United Kingdom, France, Australia, and Canada. The United States was among the countries that abstained. The adopted proposal still needs to be submitted to the United Nations General Assembly for discussion and approval.

At the meeting on the 26th, Indonesian representative Sastroamidjojo spoke again, accusing the Netherlands of violating the Round Table Agreements and attempting to annex West Irian. He said that the state and people of Indonesia are threatened by "military and political conspiracies manufactured by the Dutch government inside and outside West Irian."

Sastroamidjojo said, "This is a challenge that the government and people of Indonesia cannot stand idly by, and no force in the world can stop the Indonesian people from taking all possible measures to defend their rights."

Sastroamidjojo also accused Australia and the Netherlands of colluding to oppose Indonesia on the West Irian issue.

Indian representative Krishna Menon said that the Indian delegation believes that the West Irian issue "is merely a matter of completing Indonesian independence." Menon expressed India's support for Indonesia's demand to reclaim West Irian.

Syrian representative Zeineddine praised Indonesia's attitude on the West Irian issue. He criticized the Netherlands for refusing to negotiate and adhering to a colonialist position.

Dutch representative Schurmann, in his speech, once again defended the Netherlands' continued occupation of West Irian and once again expressed his refusal to accept the demand to resume negotiations with Indonesia. Australian representative Walker, standing on the position of the colonizers, slandered the statements made by Indonesian leaders demanding the return of West Irian as "threatening" the so-called peace of that region.

British representative Noble slandered Indonesia for using "threatening means" on the West Irian issue. He opposed the United Nations General Assembly discussing this issue.

    联大政委会结束西伊里安问题的讨论
    要求荷兰和印度尼西亚举行谈判
    沙斯特罗阿米佐约谴责荷兰制造军事和政治阴谋
    新华社27日讯　纽约消息：联合国大会政治委员会26日结束了西伊里安问题的辩论。会议最后通过锡兰等十八个亚非国家和拉丁美洲的玻利维亚联合提出的一项提案。这项提案要求荷兰和印度尼西亚就西伊里安问题重新举行谈判，并且责成联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德给予协助。
    这项提案的表决结果是四十二票赞成，二十八票反对，十一票弃权。在投反对票的国家中有英国、法国、澳大利亚和加拿大等。在弃权的国家中有美国。通过的这个提案还需要提交联合国大会全体会议讨论通过。
    在26日的会议上，印度尼西亚代表沙斯特罗阿米佐约再次发言，指责荷兰违背圆桌协定企图吞并西伊里安。他说，印度尼西亚的国家和人民“受到荷兰政府在西伊里安内部和外部制造的军事和政治阴谋”的威胁。
    沙斯特罗阿米佐约说，“这是印度尼西亚政府和人民不能袖手旁观的一个挑战，世界上没有任何力量能阻止印度尼西亚人民谋取一切可能的措施来保卫他们的权利。”
    沙斯特罗阿米佐约还指责澳大利亚和荷兰勾结在一起在西伊里安问题上反对印度尼西亚。
    印度代表克里希纳·梅农说，印度代表团认为，西伊里安问题“仅仅是完成印度尼西亚独立”的问题。梅农表示，印度支持印度尼西亚收回西伊里安的要求。
    叙利亚代表宰尼丁赞扬印度尼西亚在西伊里安问题上所采取的态度。他抨击荷兰拒绝谈判、坚持殖民主义的立场。
    荷兰代表舒尔曼在发言中再一次为荷兰继续占领西伊里安辩护。并且再一次表示拒绝接受同印度尼西亚重新举行谈判的要求。澳大利亚代表沃克站在殖民者的立场上，诬蔑印度尼西亚领导人发表的要求收回西伊里安的言论“威胁”到所谓那个地区的和平。
    英国代表诺布耳诬蔑印度尼西亚在西伊里安问题上用“威胁的手段”。他反对联合国大会讨论这个问题。
