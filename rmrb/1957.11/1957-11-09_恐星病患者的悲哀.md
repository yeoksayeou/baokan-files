　　The gentlemen in Washington have barely recovered from their fright, and a second red satellite hangs high above their heads. This time they can no longer call it a piece of scrap iron, nor can they boast that "ours is even better." They must come up with some magic weapon to belittle the Soviet achievements, to save America's ever-declining reputation, and to calm the panicking "allies." Cold War experts have racked their brains but can't find a handle to curse. Finally, one of them came up with a fresh idea: he reminded everyone that the satellite carried a small dog, and it would be possible to attack the Soviet Union for violating "canine humanitarianism." So they mobilized those dog-loving gentlemen to lodge a serious protest with the owner of the satellite. They even felt that this was not ridiculous enough, and they wanted to notify their counterparts around the world to observe a minute of silence to pay their respects and condolences to "Laika" who was travelling in space. Thus, people added new laughter to their joy, laughing at the fact that some people actually have such thick skins. I don't know who said this joke: it is better to let those gentlemen of the leisure class
　　dedicate their solemn silence to poor Dulles, because he is the one who needs comfort and pity the most right now.

　　Western news agencies reported that organizations such as the "Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals" and the "Canine Protection League" in some countries such as the United States and Britain, protested against the Soviet Union's use of dogs for artificial satellite experiments, and called on dog lovers around the world to observe a minute of silence for that "helpless, dumb animal."

    恐星病患者的悲哀
    池北偶诗　方成图华盛顿的老爷们惊魂甫定，他们头上又高悬着第二颗红色卫星。这一回再不能把它说成是块废铁，也很难再吹“我们的还要高明”。必须想出点贬低苏联成就的法宝，为了挽救美国一落再落的声誉，为了给慌张的“盟国”压惊。冷战的专家都绞尽了脑汁，就是抓不到可以咒骂的把柄。终于其中一个想出个新鲜的主意，他提醒大家卫星里载有小犬一只，大可拿这个来攻击苏联违反“狗道主义”。于是他们把那些爱狗的绅士发动了起来，向卫星的主人提出严重的抗议。他们甚至觉得这样还不够滑稽，还要通告世界各地的同好默念一分钟，向正在遨游太空的“莱伊卡”慰问和致意。于是人们在欢乐中又增添了新的笑料，可笑的是居然有人有这么厚的脸皮。不知道是谁说出了这样一句笑话：还是让那些有闲阶级的先生们
    把他们庄严的默念献给可怜的杜勒斯，因为这会儿他才最需要别人安慰和怜惜。
    西方通讯社报道，美英等一些国家的“防止虐待动物协会”、“犬类保护同盟”等组织竟抗议苏联用狗作人造卫星的试验，还号召世界各地爱狗者为那只“无助的哑吧动物”默念一分钟。
