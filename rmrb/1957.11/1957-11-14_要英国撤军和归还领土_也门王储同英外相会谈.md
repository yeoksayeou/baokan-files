    Xinhua News Agency, London, 12th - Yemen's Crown Prince Mohammed al-Badr began talks with British Foreign Secretary Lloyd on the 11th.

    The Crown Prince, who is also Yemen's Deputy Prime Minister, Foreign Minister, and Minister of Defense, said upon arriving in London via Cairo that the purpose of his visit to London was to demand that Britain return the nine "British protectorates" and withdraw British troops from all Yemeni territory, including Aden.

    However, London takes a very reserved attitude toward Badr's mission. According to well-informed sources, the intention of British officials is that Britain will firmly defend its colonial interests in the Yemen region.

    要英国撤军和归还领土
    也门王储同英外相会谈
    据新华社12日讯　伦敦消息：也门王储穆罕默德·巴德尔在11日开始同英国外交大臣劳埃德举行会谈。
    这位担任也门副首相兼外交大臣和国防大臣的王储在来伦敦经过开罗时曾经说，他访问伦敦的目的是要求英国归还九个“英国保护地”和从所有也门领土，包括亚丁在内，撤退英国部队。
    但是，伦敦方面对巴德尔此行任务持十分保留的态度。据消息灵通人士透露，英国官方人士的意向是英国将坚守它在也门地区的殖民利益。
