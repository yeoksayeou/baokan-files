    Stories on International Trains
    As we celebrate the fortieth anniversary of the great October Revolution, I am reminded of such an event.
    This happened in November of last year. Zhang Yanxia, who was working on the construction site of the Fularji Heavy Machinery Plant, was about to have a baby. Thinking that she would be better taken care of at home during her confinement period, she decided to return to Beijing. However, when she was on the Moscow-Beijing international train, the baby was about to be born. This made her very panicked. In that cold winter, and on the train, what could be done? When the Soviet train conductor on the train found out, he immediately asked the doctor on the train to deliver Zhang Yanxia's baby. Thanks to the meticulous care of many Soviet comrades working on the train, the baby was safely born while the train was moving. This made the Soviet comrades very happy. They gave the mother cookies and candies to express their congratulations. They said: This is the first baby born on our train! When the train arrived in Beijing, the Soviet conductor wrapped the baby in his own clean white blanket and called a car to take the mother and child to the hospital. Even later, the Soviet comrades were still asking about the condition of the mother and child. Now the child is almost one year old, is very healthy, and his mother has happily returned to her job.

    国际列车上的故事
    当庆祝伟大的十月革命四十周年的时候，我想起了这样一件事。
    这还是去年11月的事情。在富拉尔基重型机械厂工地工作的张砚侠要生孩子，她想到在产期在自己家里会照顾得好一点，便决定回家到北京。可是，当她乘莫斯科—北京国际列车走到中途的时候，孩子就要诞生。这使得她很恐慌。在那严寒的冬天，又是在火车上，怎么办呢？当列车上苏联车长知道以后，他马上请车上的医生给张砚侠接生。由于在列车上工作的许多苏联同志的周密的照顾，婴儿就在列车行进的时候，安全诞生了。这使得苏联的同志们高兴极了。他们给产妇送饼干、送糖表示祝贺。他们说：这还是我们列车上第一个诞生的婴儿！列车到达北京的时候，苏联的车长把自己洁白的毛毯给婴儿包好，叫汽车把她们母子送到了医院。直到后来，苏联的同志们还在打听他们母子的情况。现在孩子已经快一周岁了，身体很结实，他的妈妈又愉快地回到自己的工作岗位上去了。
