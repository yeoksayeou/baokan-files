Xinhua News Agency report: The Chongqing Branch of the Yangtze River Shipping Administration, based on the actual situation of the enterprise and the demands of the employees, plans to propose nine special plans during the rectification campaign to rely on the masses to solve some major and pressing issues of a general nature. Currently, the plan for adjusting dormitories and handling furniture, and the plan for streamlining institutions and transferring cadres, have entered the stages of implementation and mobilization discussion, respectively. The production incentive method plan has been submitted by the rectification office to the Party Committee for study and decision. Other plans, such as personnel management and labor allocation, the handling of ground apprentices, probationary personnel, and improperly hired personnel, the unified supply system, and the plan to improve leadership style from the system, have also established special project teams, equipped with capable cadres to conduct investigations and research, so as to propose preliminary plans for discussion by the masses.
    According to the experience of the Chongqing Branch of the Yangtze River Shipping Administration, adopting the method of special projects to solve major problems of a general nature is a good way to avoid bureaucracy and formalism in rectification work. For example, after the start of the rectification campaign in May, the employees of the branch had many opinions on the allocation of family dormitories. Shipboard employees said that shore-based employees lived in too many, and shore-based employees said that leading cadres lived in too many. In order to solve this prominent internal contradiction, the branch's Housing Management Committee delegated the authority to allocate housing to the grassroots level, where the administrative and trade union organizations mobilized the masses to conduct democratic evaluation based solely on housing difficulties. After implementing this method, it is now uncommon for people to quarrel and clamor for houses in the administrative management section all day long. The personnel in charge of housing are no longer busy receiving people all day long and can settle down to conduct investigations, research, organize materials, and formulate plans. Recently, with the help of the housing allocation special project team, they conducted investigations and research and proposed a plan for adjusting employee dormitories.
    Using special project methods to solve major problems can also make rectification work deeper and more thorough. For example, the plan for streamlining institutions and transferring cadres, which is currently in the stage of mobilization and discussion, saw Chongqing Branch employees sharply criticizing phenomena such as too many meetings, too many documents, over-detailed division of labor, unclear responsibilities, mutual shirking, and bloated institutions during the airing of views period. Now, through discussions, employees have put forward many specific methods for streamlining institutions. The Technology and Safety Section, Education Section, Port Affairs Section, and Ship Management Section have all proposed merging with relevant sections. After preliminary discussions by section heads, many sections have exceeded the original target of streamlining management personnel by 30%. The Port Affairs Section believes that at least 50% of management personnel can be streamlined. Some sections are calculating workloads, seeking ways to simplify systems, and determining the powers that should be delegated, so that management institutions can be as streamlined and flexible as possible.

    采取专案办法解决重大问题
    新华社讯　长江航运管理局重庆分局根据企业实际情况和职工群众的要求，在整改工作中准备提出九个专门方案，以便依靠群众解决一些全局性的重大迫切问题。目前调整宿舍处理家具方案和紧缩机构下放干部方案已分别进入贯彻执行和动员讨论阶段，生产奖励办法方案已由整改办公室提请党委研究决定。其他如人事管理劳动力调配方案，地面学徒、试用人员和进用不当人员处理方案，统一供应制度方案和从制度上改进领导作风方案等，也都设置了专案小组，配备得力干部进行调查研究，以便提出初步方案，交付群众讨论。
    根据长江航运管理局重庆分局的经验，对普遍性的重大问题采取专案解决的办法，是使整改工作避免官僚主义和形式主义的好办法。例如5月份整风开始以后，这个局职工群众对家属宿舍分配意见很多，船上职工说岸上职工住多了，岸上职工说领导干部住多了。为了解决这个突出的内部矛盾，分局房屋管理委员会把具体分配住房的权限下放到基层，由基层的行政和工会组织群众，以住居困难为唯一标准进行民主评议。实行这个办法以后，现在，在行政管理科整天吵闹、叫嚷要房子的情况已经不常见了。经管房屋的人员不再整天忙于接待，可以静下来作调查研究，整理资料和拟订规划。最近他们就在房屋分配专案小组的帮助下，通过调查研究，提出了职工宿舍调整方案。
    用专案方法解决重大问题，还可使整改工作改得深改得透。例如目前正处在动员讨论阶段的紧缩机构下放干部方案，在鸣放时期中，重庆分局职工就对会议多、文件多、分工过细、职责不明、互相推诿和机构臃肿等现象提出了尖锐批评。现在通过讨论职工们又提出了许多紧缩机构的具体办法。技安科，教育科，港务科，船管科等部门都提出了同有关科室合并的建议。经过科室负责人初步讨论，不少科室已突破了紧缩管理人员30％的原定指标，港务科认为起码可以紧缩管理人员50％。有的科室正在计算工作量，寻求简化制度的办法，确定应该下放的权力，使管理机构尽可能地达到精干灵活。
