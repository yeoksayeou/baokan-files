Xinhua News Agency, November 11th: China's forest industry has developed rapidly. During the first Five-Year Plan period, state-owned forest industrial enterprises produced a total of 98.54 million cubic meters of logs (including purchases from the South), exceeding the plan by 5.34 million cubic meters. The production level in 1957 was 254.3% of that in 1952.

    Since liberation, with the help of Soviet experts, China's forest industry has implemented the policy of rational logging, rational afforestation, and rational utilization, fundamentally changing the situation of indiscriminate felling during the period of Japanese and Kuomintang rule, and improving the utilization rate of forest resources, and opening up new timber harvesting bases. In recent years, the Lesser Khingan Mountains forest area has been fully developed, and the southern slope of the Greater Khingan Mountains and the Dadu River forest area in Sichuan have been developed and utilized. New forest areas have also been developed in Yunnan, Hunan, Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian and other provinces, and the forest resources in the upper reaches of many rivers and high mountain areas with inconvenient transportation have begun to be utilized. For example, in the Minjiang forest area of Sichuan, the maximum annual production of fir timber before liberation was 30,000 cubic meters. After liberation, it has increased year by year, and timber production in 1957 will exceed 1.2 million cubic meters.

    In the past five years, there have also been many improvements in the technology of the forest industry. The annual operations of felling, skidding, and transporting timber in state-owned enterprises can be carried out relatively evenly. In the past, 71% of the production in the main forest areas of Northeast China and Inner Mongolia was concentrated in the first and fourth quarters, and now 43% is produced in the second and third quarters. In this way, the labor force has been fully utilized, labor productivity in 1957 increased by 74.1% compared with 1952, the production cost of logs per cubic meter decreased by 9.4% compared with 1953, and the proportion of comprehensive mechanization in forest areas has also increased significantly.

    During the first Five-Year Plan, the investment in the forest industry reached 650 million yuan, 18 timber harvesting enterprises were established, 2,621 kilometers of forest railways were built, and 509 various power saws, 871 tractors, and 640 trucks were added. Timber processing plants and forest chemical industries have also developed greatly, and the number of employees has increased by 20% compared with 1952. Over the years, 11,572 students have graduated from 37 higher education institutions and secondary forestry schools, which is 3.85 times that of the 22 years under the Kuomintang rule.

    森林工业发展迅速
    五年来生产水平增长一倍半
    据新华社11日讯　我国森林工业发展迅速，第一个五年计划期中，国营森林工业企业总共生产原木九千八百五十四万立方公尺（包括南方收购部分），比计划多五百三十四万立方公尺。1957年的生产水平为1952年的254．3％。
    解放后，我国森林工业在苏联专家的帮助下，实行了合理采伐、合理造林、合理利用的方针，根本改变了日寇和国民党统治时期乱砍滥伐的状况，并提高了森林资源的利用率，开辟了新的木材采伐基地。几年来，全面开发了小兴安岭林区，开发利用了大兴安岭南坡和四川大渡河林区，并在云南、湖南、广东、广西、福建等省开发了新的林区，开始利用了许多交通不便的江河上游和高山地带的森林资源。如四川岷江林区，解放前每年最多生产杉木三万立方公尺，解放后逐年增长，到1957年生产木材将超过一百二十万立方公尺。
    五年来，森林工业的技术也有很多改进，国营企业的采伐、集材、运材的常年作业能够比较均衡地进行了；过去东北、内蒙古的主要林区，有71％是在第一、四季度生产，现在已有43％是在第二、三季度生产。这样，劳动力便得到了充分的利用，劳动生产率1957年比1952年提高74．1％，原木生产成本每立方公尺较1953年降低9．4％，林区综合机械化的比重也有显著增加。
    第一个五年计划中，森林工业投资达六亿五千万元，建立了木材采伐企业十八个，修建森林铁路二千六百二十一公里，增设各种动力锯五百零九台、拖拉机八百七十一台、载重汽车六百四十辆。木材加工厂和森林化学工业都有很大发展，职工人数也比1952年增加了20％。历年由三十七个高等院系和中等林业学校毕业的学生就有一万一千五百七十二人，等于国民党统治时期二十二年的三点八五倍。
