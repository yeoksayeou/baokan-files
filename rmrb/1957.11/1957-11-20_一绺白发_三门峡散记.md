    A Lock of White Hair
    ——Notes from Sanmenxia
    Lei Jia

    Investigating a major personal accident is not merely a simple routine. The thought that this accident has already happened, and as the safety inspector said, it was the kind of accident that is not easy to prevent, it is always a heavy blow to everyone who is present at the scene.
    I had just met this young crane operator five days ago. His name was Zhang Keqin, a strong and decent young man.
    That day, the large barge carrying a three-cubic-meter power shovel chassis across the river suddenly broke free from its anchor chain and drifted towards Sanmen Island. Fortunately, it ran aground on a reef on the island, preventing it from being smashed to pieces. The Yellow River continued to rise, and this large barge, weighing forty tons, was like an autumn leaf. It seemed to be taking a rest, but perhaps in the next second, it would not be content until it had crashed into Sanmen Island as the river rose. The whirlpools beside Sanmen Island have buried countless ships and lives since ancient times!
    Speaking of which, it was only a little over a hundred meters from Ghost Island to that barge. Ghost Island is on the right bank, and all the people who came to rescue it stepped onto Ghost Island from the right bank; but the people on Ghost Island and the people on that barge, separated by this hundred-odd meters of river, not to mention how difficult it was to pull a rope, even shouting to each other could not be heard.
    Five brave crane operators jumped into the water. They advanced along the rocks that had just emerged from the water. The rocks were sharp and uneven, and the distances were different. How agile they were, and how dangerous! The flood under their feet was swirling, as if it would suck people and rocks down together. The people on the shore were already dizzy from the roar of the water, how could they be? But they stood in a line on the rocks, and a coir rope was passed up from behind. The young man standing at the front was coiling the coir rope in his hand and throwing it towards the barge. The current was the fastest here, and the waves were even more turbulent. The coir rope fell into the water. Like a kite string blown away by the wind, it was very, very difficult to hold it. At this moment, the young man used too much force, lost his footing and fell into the water, and he was like a kite with a broken string, drifting down with the current.
    Everyone exclaimed. This was a man with a slim chance of survival, and he had to be rescued; but how to rescue him? Just now, his heavy clothes could still be seen, but in the next second, they appeared again in a very distant place. No one expected that almost at the same time as this young man fell into the water, a sheepskin raft went into the water. Another young man was standing on it, and his sheepskin raft was chasing the faintly visible drowning man at a faster speed. I breathed a sigh of relief and asked a worker beside me:
      "Who is that?"
    "Zhang Keqin! He's from Henan, and he's been using sheepskin rafts since he was a child. Look, he's catching up!"
    Before long, I saw these two people walking back along the foot of the cliff. Zhang Keqin followed behind, carrying the dripping wet sheepskin raft on his shoulder.
    Five days later, the large barge was towed back to its original ferry crossing. I never expected that this false alarm had just passed, and a second accident occurred.
    This happened in a second, and no one can describe its process in detail. At that time...
    When the barge was about to approach the left bank dock from the right bank dock, a cable was thrown onto the shore. The other end of the cable was wrapped around the bollard of the barge by three strong workers, and they were to gradually shrink the cable little by little so that the barge would slowly approach the shore despite the impact of the current. The flood peak had just passed, and its remaining power was still there. These three people could not withstand the impact of its power. At first, they were still in a state of equilibrium, but watching the power of the water was about to defeat them. As long as the cable slipped from their hands, this time the barge floated to Sanmen Island, it might not be stranded by the reef again, and its fate would be conceivable.
    At that time, behind the three people was a neat coil of cable, and behind it, leaning against the low hatch, sat two other people. One was a foreman in his thirties wearing a Chinese-style jacket, and the other was Zhang Keqin, the young man who used the sheepskin raft last time. It is necessary to explain here that Zhang Keqin was truly a top-notch crane operator, not only did he save people last time, but he also ran ahead in every work. The foreman often touched his chin and described him like this: "Who? So fast? It's him again, done in the blink of an eye, who can be so quick besides Zhang Keqin!" Zhang Keqin was the foreman's treasure, a capable assistant, so naturally the foreman loved to give him work, and he was willing to chat with him when he was free. This is how it was today, the two of them were sitting together again. When the three people pulling the cable felt the danger, they both came out at the same time. They both thought in their hearts at the same time that as long as one of them ran over and added their strength, then this dangerous situation could be avoided, so these two people also jumped up at the same time without hesitation and rushed forward.
    Just like the foreman usually liked to say: "Who? So fast? Just in the blink of an eye..." This time it was the same, Zhang Keqin rushed ahead of the foreman again, truly a lovable person who did not hesitate to add all the praise to his head...
    But this time, only this time, Zhang Keqin's speed did not keep up with the required speed. He did not have time to reach the bollard, the cable had already slipped from the numb hands of the three workers, and, at this time, one of Zhang Keqin's feet happened to step into the circle of that coil of cable, because he was a second too slow, and did not move his foot out, the cable that escaped into the river, trapped his foot, the river opened its big mouth, and sucked him in in the blink of an eye.
    Within a few hours, Zhang Keqin's body was not found. When everyone gave up the last glimmer of hope, they found him under the boat again. The rope knot was still tied to his foot; but he was already dead.
    The memorial service was held on the river beach. A charcoal portrait was temporarily hung, which was Zhang Keqin's last image in the hearts of the worker painters: short hair, covering a resolute face, he was still glaring at the Yellow River to the death.
    The safety inspector walked back and forth, he could not settle down to do one thing, he could not even put a wreath in front of Zhang Keqin's coffin. Someone in the crowd sighed and said: "He just came back from his engagement at home ten days ago!" The safety inspector walked to my side, as if to answer this sentence, avoided his head, did not look into my eyes, and said sadly:
    "Is there anything more terrible than...than accidents that happen while rescuing accidents?"
    But the most grief-stricken person at the meeting was the foreman squatting behind the crowd. I recognized him from the Chinese-style jacket. He was holding his head and weeping on his knees. No one went to comfort him, and no one could comfort him.
    The setting sun was low on the Loess Plateau, and the water of the Yellow River was roaring in a low voice.
    The coffin was moved onto the truck, and five or six people came to help the foreman who was crying. Everyone knew that he would definitely go with Zhang Keqin; but he refused to get up. Everyone temporarily forgot their sadness and comforted him and enlightened him like a child... Sadness can occupy a person's heart more than happiness. If not with the help of other people's hands, he could neither nail the last nail on the coffin, nor put on a piece of clothing for his beloved person, these are what he should have done, and what he did not do...
    A month later, I returned to the construction site. At the bus station, I met the safety inspector. He pulled me and said:
    "Wait for the next bus, we can have a good talk!"
      "Okay," I said, "I heard that towing cables with three-cubic-meter power shovels is terrible if there is an accident, I wonder what systems you have established?"
      "It's not just me now, look at that..." He pointed to an old man getting on the bus, "With him, all systems are easy to establish."
    "Who is that?" I asked.
    "He is that foreman! He was sick for half a month after that memorial service. You see he is old, and what is even more strange is that a lock of white hair has grown on his head. Everyone asked him what was going on? He said he didn't know. He automatically asked to be a safety officer, and if anyone does not pay attention to safe operating procedures, they are afraid of being criticized by him. You will see later, when he criticizes people, he is always so excited that he takes off his hat. He doesn't do it intentionally. When he wakes up, he quickly puts his hat back on, but people have already seen that lock of white hair, as if that lock of white hair has supreme majesty. Since he became a safety inspector, there has never been an accident. How quickly a person changes! He doesn't like to talk as much as before! He doesn't even laugh! But one time, I heard him talking in his sleep. He said: 'It wasn't him, it was me, I should have gone, it would have been better if I had...' He said, gritting his teeth. I think he is suffering. What do these dreams mean? Could it be that he should have been the first to run over that day, stepped into the rope circle, and as a result, Zhang Keqin rushed in front of him and died for him, that's why he is so painful? But he has never said a word about this matter..."
    I went to the construction site with him, and first walked towards the two three-cubic-meter power shovels. The tail of the power shovel was dragging a huge cable. When the power shovel moved, a dozen workers had to drag the cable at the same time. The cable was wrapped in insulating rubber tubing, but even so, it still crackled and sparked when it encountered water, because this current is high voltage! Next to the cable were placed a dozen pairs of insulated rubber boots and rubber gloves. The workers pulling the cable had to wear them and put them on when operating. I saw the foreman standing next to these rubber boots, motionless, as if he were guarding them.

    一绺白发
    ——三门峡散记
    雷加
    检查一个重大的人身事故，并不仅仅是简单的例行公事。想到这个事故已经发生，并像安全检查员所说的又是那种不易防止的事故的时候，它对每个亲莅现场的人，永远都是一个沉重的打击。
    我在五天之前，刚刚认识了这个年青的起重工。他的名字叫张克勤，是个又健壮又体面的小伙子。
    那天，那只载着三方电铲底盘过河的大驳船，突然挣脱了锚链，向三门岛流去。所幸的它在神岛上面一块礁石上搁住了，才没有撞得粉碎。黄河的水继续上涨，这只载重四十吨的大驳船，如同一片秋叶，它像是在歇歇脚，也许下一秒钟，它就随着上涨的河水非在神岛上撞个粉碎不甘心。神岛旁边的涡流，自古到今已不知埋葬过多少船只和多少生命了！
    说起来，由鬼岛到那只驳船，只有一百多公尺。鬼岛在右岸，所有跑来抢险的人，都由右岸踏上了鬼岛；但鬼岛上的人和那只驳船上的人，隔着这一百多公尺的河面，不要说扯上一根绳索是那么不容易，就是互相喊话也听不见。
    五个勇敢的起重工，跳下水去。他们沿着刚刚露出水面的一块一块礁石，向前跃进。礁石尖削不平，距离又不等，他们多么矫健，又是多么危险。脚下的洪水打着漩涡，简直要把人带礁石一起吸下去似的，岸上的人听见咆哮的水声早就有些昏眩了，他们又该怎样呢？可是他们站在礁石上一字排开了，一根棕绳由后边递上去了。站在最前面的那个小伙子，正在把棕绳盘在手上向驳船扔去。这里流速最大，波浪也更汹涌。棕绳落到了水里，它像大风吹跑了的风筝线一般，要想拖住它是非常非常困难的。这时，这个小伙子用力过猛，失了足跌在水里，而他也就像断线的风筝，随着急流漂了下去。
    大家惊呼起来。这是一个九死一生的人，必需抢救；但又怎么抢救？刚才还看见他的沉重的衣服，下一秒钟，它又在很远的地方出现了。谁也没有想到几乎在这个小伙子落水的同时，一只羊皮筏子下水了。上面站着另一个小伙子，他的羊皮筏子用了更快的速度，追逐那个忽隐忽现的落水的人。我喘了一口气，向身旁一个工人问道：
      “那是谁？”
    “张克勤！从河南来的，从小就使惯了羊皮筏子，看他追上啦！”
    不一会，我就看见这两个人沿着峭壁脚下走了回来。张克勤跟在后面，他的肩上扛着那只湿淋淋的羊皮筏子。
    五天之后，这只大驳船拖回原来的渡口那里去了。我万万没有想到这场虚惊刚刚过去，又发生了第二次事故。
    这是在一秒钟里发生的事，没有人可以详细地叙述它的经过。当时……
    这只驳船由右岸码头正要靠近左岸码头的时候，一根缆绳扔到了岸上。缆绳的另一端由三个壮工绕在驳船的将军柱上拉住，要由他们一点一点地收缩这根缆绳，这只驳船才会冲破水流的冲击慢慢地靠岸的。洪峰刚刚过去，它的余威犹在，这三个人抵挡不了它的冲击的力量。最初还在平衡状态中，眼看着水的力量就要战胜他们，只要缆绳由他们手中滑脱，这一次驳船流到三门岛，就不一定再被礁石搁住，它的命运就可想而知了。
    那时在他们三个人身后，是一盘整整齐齐的缆绳，再后面靠着低低的舱口坐着另外两个人。一个是三十几岁的穿对襟袷袄的工长，一个就是张克勤，上次使用羊皮筏子的那个小伙子。这里必需交代一下，张克勤真正是个顶呱呱的起重工，不但上次救了人，就是平常工作中，也处处跑在前头。工长常常用手摸着下巴这末来形容他道：“是谁？这么快？又是他，一眨眼就干好了，除了张克勤谁能这么马俐！”张克勤是工长眼中的宝贝，得力的助手，自然工长有了工作爱交给他，闲聊天也愿意找他。今天就是这样，两个人又坐在一起了。那三个人拉着缆绳感到危险时，他们两个也都同时出来了。他们两个也都同时在心里想到，只要他们之中有一个跑去，加上自己的力量，那末这个危局就可以避免，于是这两个人也都毫不犹疑地同时跳起来，向前冲去。
    正像工长平时爱说的：“是谁？这么快？只一眨眼……”这次也是一样，张克勤又抢在工长的前头，真是不惜用一切赞美的词句加在他的头上的这么一个可爱的人……
    但是这一次，只是这一次张克勤的速度没有跟上要求的速度，他没有来得及赶到将军柱跟前，缆绳已由那三个工人的麻木的手掌里滑脱了，而且，这时张克勤的一只脚正好踏进那盘缆绳的圈子里，因为慢了一秒钟，没有把脚迈出来，那根向河中逸去的缆绳，套住他的脚，河水张开大嘴，一眨眼就把他吸进去了。
    几个钟头以内，没有捞到张克勤的尸首，大家放弃了最后一线希望的时候，又在船底下发现了他。那个绳扣还套在他的脚上；可是他却早已死去了。
    追悼会是在河滩上举行的。临时挂上了一幅木炭画像，这是张克勤活在工人画家心中最后的遗容：剪短的头发，复在一张刚毅的脸上，至死他还在横眉凝视着黄河的流水。
    安全检查员来回走着，他不能安心做一件事情，甚至不能把一个花圈放在张克勤的灵前。人群中有人慨叹了一声，说道：“十天以前他才从家中订亲回来的呀！”安全检查员走到我的身旁，仿佛为了回答这句话，避开头，不看我的眼睛，悲伤地说：
    “还有比……比抢救事故而发生的事故，更可怕的吗？”
    但是会场上感到最悲痛的，却是蹲在人群后面的那个工长。我是从那件对襟袷袄认出他来的。他抱着头俯在膝盖上痛哭着。没有人去安慰他，也不能够安慰他。
    夕阳，低垂在黄土高原上，黄河的水在低沉地吼着。
    灵柩搬上了卡车，五六个人前来搀扶哭成一堆的工长。大家都知道他是一定要跟着张克勤一起去的；但是他偏又不肯起来。大家暂时忘记了自己的悲伤，像对待一个小孩子似地劝慰他，开导他……悲哀比快乐更能占据一个人的心灵，如果不借别人的手，他既不能在棺材上钉上最后一颗钉子，也不能替自己亲爱的人穿上一件衣服，这些都是他应该做的，而又没有做的……
    一个月之后，我又回到了工地上。在汽车站我遇见了那位安全检查员。他扯了我一把，说：
    “等下趟车再走，我们正好谈谈！”
      “也好，”我说：“听说三方电铲拖电缆，出个事故就不得了，不知你们建立了些什么制度？”
      “现在不是我一个人了，你看那个……”他指着一个正在上车的老人，“有了他，一切制度都容易建立的。”
    “那是谁？”我问。
    “他就是那位工长呀！从那天追悼会以后，他病了半个月。你看出他老了，更奇怪的是他的头上长出了一绺白发。大家问他这是怎么搞的？他说不知道。他是自动要求做安全员的，如果有谁不重视安全操作规程，都怕受他的批评。你以后会看到的，他批评人的时候，总是激动得摘下帽子，他不是有意如此，当他醒悟过来，就又赶紧戴上帽子，可是人家已经看见那绺白发了，好像那绺白发有无上威严似的。从他当上安全检查员，从未出过事故。一个人变得多么快呀！他不像以前那么爱说话啦！甚至也不笑啦！可是有一次，我听见他说梦话。他说：‘不是他，是我，应该我去，要是我多好……’一面说，一面咬牙。我想他在受着折磨。这些梦话是什么意思呢，莫非是那天应该是他头一个跑去，踩在绳圈里，结果是张克勤抢在他的前面，替他死了，才使他这样痛苦吗？可是他关于这件事，一句话也没有说过。……”
    我同他到了工地，首先就向两部三方电铲走去。电铲尾部拖着巨大的电缆，电铲移动时，就要由十几个工人拖着电缆同时移动。电缆上裹着绝缘的胶管，但是尽管如此，遇到水时，还滋滋地直冒火星子，因为这股电流是高压的呵！紧挨着电缆放着十几双绝缘的胶皮靴子和胶皮手套，拉电缆的工人操作时，必需穿上它们和戴上它们，我看见那位工长站在这些胶皮靴子旁边，一动不动，仿佛守卫的一般。
