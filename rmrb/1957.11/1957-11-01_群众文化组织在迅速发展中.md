The cultural center undertaking is a young cultural undertaking among all cultural undertakings. In recent years, with the care of the Party and the government, the development of cultural centers has been thriving. In 1949, there were 896 cultural centers nationwide, and now they have developed to 2,584, an increase of nearly two times. In addition, 3,000 cultural stations have been established, and 24 cultural service teams have been established in ethnic minority nomadic areas. Under the demonstration and guidance of these national mass cultural institutions, mass-run amateur cultural organizations have also developed rapidly. In the early days of liberation, there were few mass-run clubs, libraries, and amateur theater troupes. Since the upsurge of agricultural cooperativization and the socialist transformation of cities last year, mass-run cultural undertakings have sprung up like mushrooms after a rain. At present, 370,000 rural clubs, 200,000 rural libraries, and 520,000 rural amateur theater troupes and other amateur art organizations have been established nationwide. A large number of mass cultural organizations such as clubs, libraries, and amateur theater troupes have also been established in cities, industrial and mining areas. These cultural undertaking organizations are important strongholds for conducting socialist ideological education among the broad masses of people, and have played an active role in promoting major political movements and central tasks. Taking the current rural socialist education movement as an example, many cultural centers and stations are actively involved in this great movement. They promote the development of the movement by holding exhibitions, supplying literary and artistic propaganda materials, training key personnel, and organizing mobile propaganda and guidance teams. According to recent incomplete statistics, 790 rural clubs, 174 amateur theater troupes, 737 literary and artistic storytelling groups, 1,083 reading groups, 1,460 blackboards, and 420 earthen radios have carried out propaganda activities.

Cultural centers and stations have also played a significant role in enlivening and enriching the cultural life of the masses. Cultural centers, stations, and cultural service teams not only carry out activities during the slack farming season and festivals, but also carry out small-scale and decentralized activities during the busy farming season, such as singing folk songs, reading newspapers in the fields, and moonlight evening parties. In recent years, the work of sorting out and promoting folk art in various cultural centers and stations has gradually been carried out, which has greatly promoted the work of cultural centers and stations. For example, the Nine Lotus Lanterns, Wedding Dance, and Flower Cymbal Drum programs of the Second National Folk Music and Dance Performance held this spring were compiled by the Xianyou County and Xiapu County Cultural Centers of Fujian Province and the Changping District Cultural Center of Beijing respectively. Some programs are compiled by cultural centers and stations and processed by relevant departments. The sorting out and promotion of folk art activities not only enriches the culture and art of the motherland, but also makes outstanding contributions to creating a new culture with socialist national forms, and also enlivens the cultural life of the masses.

At present, there are still some problems in the work of cultural centers and stations that need to be resolved. First of all, the leading departments in some places do not have a sufficient understanding of the role of cultural centers and stations, and do not regard them as important strongholds for conducting socialist ideological education among the broad masses of people. Instead, they mistakenly believe that their work is just jumping and jumping, and is insignificant. Therefore, they have not given appropriate arrangements for the work of cultural centers and stations. The cultural authorities in some places do not go deep enough into the cultural centers and stations, and their investigations and researches are not deep enough. In addition, the procrastination in their work has prevented problems that could be solved from being solved in a timely manner. Secondly, the cadre training work cannot keep up with the needs of the development of mass cultural work. In recent years, a large number of mass cultural organizations such as clubs, libraries, and amateur theater troupes have been established, and the political and cultural level of the masses has improved. Therefore, the requirements for cultural centers and stations are also different from before. All localities should adapt to the development of the objective situation and further improve the working level of cadres in cultural centers and stations. In addition, although the houses and equipment of cultural centers and stations have been improved in recent years, due to the poor foundation, limited funds, and insufficient attention to this issue in the localities, some cultural centers and stations still lack the necessary places and equipment to carry out mass cultural activities. We cannot demand too much or be too impatient on this issue, and we must seek gradual solutions in our work. At the same time, we should give full play to the potential of existing equipment, carry forward the style of hard work and plain living, and implement the policy of diligence and thrift in running cultural undertakings to run cultural centers well.

    群众文化组织在迅速发展中
    梁泽楚
    文化馆事业是各项文化事业中一项年轻的文化事业。几年来，在党和政府的关怀下，文化馆事业的发展蒸蒸日上。1949年全国共有文化馆八百九十六个，现在已经发展到二千五百八十四个，增加将近两倍。另外，还设立了文化站三千个，在少数民族游牧地区设立了文化服务队二十四个。在这些国家举办的群众文化机构的示范和辅导下，群众自办的业余文化组织，也迅速地发展起来。解放初期，群众自办的俱乐部、图书室和业余剧团很少。自从去年农业合作化高潮和城市社会主义改造高潮以后，群众自办的文化事业像雨后春笋般地建立起来。现在全国已建立了三十七万个农村俱乐部，二十万个农村图书室，五十二万个农村业余剧团等业余艺术组织。在城市、工矿区也建立了大量的俱乐部、图书室和业余剧团等群众文化组织。这些文化事业组织，都是向广大群众进行社会主义思想教育的重要据点，在历次重大政治运动和各项中心工作中，都起了积极的推动作用。就拿目前农村社会主义教育运动来说，很多文化馆、站都积极地投入这个伟大的运动。它们通过举办展览，供应文艺宣传材料，培养骨干和组织巡回宣传辅导队等方式，推动运动的开展。根据最近不完全的统计，已有七百九十个农村俱乐部，一百七十四个业余剧团，七百三十七个文艺说唱小组，一千零八十三个读报组，一千四百六十块黑板报，四百二十个土广播开展了宣传活动。
    文化馆、站对活跃和丰富群众文化生活，也起了很大的作用。文化馆、站和文化服务队不仅在农闲和节日开展活动，在农忙时也开展小型分散的活动，如唱山歌、地头读报、月光晚会等。几年来，各地文化馆、站对民间艺术的整理和推广工作逐渐开展，使文化馆、站的工作大大地向前推进了一步。如今年春季举行的第二届全国民间音乐、舞蹈会演的九莲灯、婚礼舞、花钹大鼓等节目，是由福建省仙游县、霞浦县文化馆和北京市昌平区文化馆分别整理的。有的节目由文化馆、站整理，又由有关部门进行加工。民间艺术活动的整理和推广，不仅丰富了祖国文化艺术，也对创造社会主义的民族形式的新文化有着卓越的贡献，而且活跃了群众的文化生活。
    目前文化馆、站工作中也还有些问题需要解决。首先，有的地方的领导部门，对文化馆、站的作用认识不足，没有把它看成是向广大群众进行社会主义思想教育的重要据点，却错误地认为它们的工作只是蹦蹦跳跳，无足轻重，因此，对文化馆、站的工作没有给以适当的安排。有的地方的文化主管部门深入文化馆、站不够，调查研究也不深不透，加上工作中的拖拉作风，使可以解决的问题没有得到及时的解决。其次，干部训练工作，赶不上群众文化工作发展的需要。几年来，俱乐部、图书室、业余剧团等群众文化组织大量地建立起来，群众的政治和文化水平提高了，因此，对文化馆、站的要求与以前也不同了。各地要适应客观形势的发展，进一步提高文化馆、站干部的工作水平。此外，几年来文化馆、站的房屋和设备虽有改善，但由于基础差，经费有限，以及地方上对这一问题的重视不够，因而有一部分文化馆、站还缺乏必要的开展群众文化活动的场所和设备。对这一问题我们不能要求过高过急，要在工作中求得逐步解决。同时，应充分发挥现有设备的潜力，发扬艰苦朴素的作风，贯彻勤俭办事业的方针来办好文化馆。
