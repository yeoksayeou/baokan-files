Xinhua News Agency, Paris, November 29th: French Prime Minister Félix Gaillard declared on the 28th that France does not agree to reorganize the North Atlantic Alliance in a way that would give the United States and Britain dominance over its allies.

Gaillard made the above statement when reporting to the Foreign Affairs Committee of the National Assembly on his talks with British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan. He also announced: "France will not agree to any specialization in the scientific field that excludes it from the field of nuclear energy." Observers point out that this sentence is a strong hint that France is pursuing its own nuclear weapons manufacturing program, regardless of the intention of the US and Britain to monopolize nuclear weapons within the North Atlantic group.

Gaillard also spoke about the US and Britain shipping weapons to Tunisia. He said that he had told Macmillan that the US and Britain's shipment of weapons to Tunisia, despite France's protests, was "inappropriate and unfriendly."

Gaillard expressed satisfaction with Britain's understanding of France's position on the Algerian issue. At the same time, he stated that in order to increase the allies' "confidence" in France, the Algerian "Basic Law" must be passed by a large majority.

Gaillard confirmed that he would reject the suggestions from Tunisia and Morocco to mediate the Algerian dispute.

    法国不甘让美英当盟主
    盖伊阿声明不同意改组北大西洋联盟
    新华社29日讯　巴黎消息：法国总理盖伊阿28日声明：法国不同意改组北大西洋联盟，而使美国和英国获得对其盟国的支配地位。
    盖伊阿在国民议会外交委员会报告他同英国首相麦克米伦会谈的情况时，作了上述声明。他还宣布：“法国不会同意在科学领域上把它排斥在核能领域之外的任何特殊化行动。”据观察家指出，这句话是一个强烈的暗示，暗示法国正在执行它自己的制造核武器的计划，而不顾美英两国要在北大西洋集团内垄断核武器的意图。
    盖伊阿还谈到美英运送武器给突尼斯的问题。他说，他已经告诉麦克米伦：英美两国不顾法国的抗议而把武器运给突尼斯，是“不恰当和不友好的”。
    盖伊阿对英国在阿尔及利亚问题上理解法国的立场表示满意。同时他表示，为了提高盟国对法国的“信心”，必须以很大的多数票通过阿尔及利亚“根本法”。
    盖伊阿证实，他将拒绝突尼斯和摩洛哥出面调停阿尔及利亚争端的建议。
