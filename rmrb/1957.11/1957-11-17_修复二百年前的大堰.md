    Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu Dispatch: The Shuitang Dam in Huatan Township, Ningnan County, Sichuan Province, which had collapsed for nearly two hundred years, was recently repaired and reopened by the local agricultural cooperative.
    The Shuitang Dam is located in a remote mountainous area more than 700 kilometers southwest of Chengdu. It was originally built during the Qianlong era of the Qing Dynasty. Local farmers spent thirteen years building this dam, but it only lasted for twelve years before collapsing due to landslides and rockslides, turning a thousand mu of paddy fields into dry land. Last autumn, after the merger of three local primary agricultural cooperatives into the Shuitang Advanced Agricultural Cooperative with 199 member households, the arduous project of repairing the dam began in February of this year, after careful research and preparation.
    Building irrigation ditches on overhanging cliffs was extremely difficult. Cooperative cadre Ji Shihui led the members, using wild mountain vines to tie themselves, dangling from the mountain to drill blasting holes and open channels. Communist Youth League member Ji Shixu was seriously injured while setting off stone cannons, but he returned from the hospital to participate in the work before his injury had fully healed. With the collective efforts of the members, all kinds of difficulties were finally overcome, and the dam was completely repaired.

    修复二百年前的大堰
    据新华社成都电  四川省宁南县华弹乡塌毁了将近两百年的水塘大堰，不久以前被当地农业社修复通水了。
    水塘大堰在成都西南七百多公里外的偏僻山区。原是清朝乾隆年间修成的。当地农民为了修建这座大堰，花费了十三年的工夫，但只使用了十二年，就因为山垮岩崩而塌毁了，使一千亩水田变成了旱地。去年秋天，当地三个初级农业社合并建成拥有一百九十九户社员的水塘高级农业社后，经过周密的研究和准备，修复大堰的艰巨工程从今年2月起开工了。
    在悬岩陡壁上修水沟遇到极大困难。社干部吉世挥带领社员们，用野山藤绑着身子，从山上吊下去，悬在空中打炮眼，开渠道。共青团员吉世绪放石炮时受了重伤，伤还未完全养好，便从医院回来参加工作。在社员集体努力下，终于克服了各种困难，完全修复了。
