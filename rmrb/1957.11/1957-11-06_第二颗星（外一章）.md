    The Second Star (and an Additional Chapter)
    Zang Kejia

    A few days ago, the news spread like thunder; today, you have already flown into the sky. "The Bible" says, "God said, let there be light, and there was light"; the words of the Soviets are as solid as pure steel. The first star weighed more than eighty kilograms, the second one is six times fatter. The "satellite" in the belly of American scientists, the highest ideal is only "a few pounds."

      The First Satellite Speaks:
      I was the first to open up a path in the high sky. My companion, follow closely and dance with me. I only took off a few dozen days earlier; the latecomer surpasses the former, it is even more miraculous and perfect than me. Hundreds of millions of people applaud and cheer for us, but a few are unhappy. We are the offspring of Soviet science, not some "divine entrustment" [Note].

    [Note] In 1945, the American army dropped the atomic bomb on Nagasaki, believing it to be a rare treasure and arrogant, calling this killing weapon a "divine entrustment."

    第二颗星（外一章）
    臧克家几日前消息轰传，今天，你已经飞上了天，“圣经”上说“上帝说有光就有了光”；苏联人的话结实得像纯钢。第一颗星体重八十多公斤，第二颗比它有六倍胖，美国科学家肚皮里的“卫星”，最高的理想仅仅是“几磅”。
      第一颗卫星的话我第一个在高空开辟道路，我的同伴呀，紧跟上来和我翩翩齐舞，我不过先起飞了几十天，后来居上，它比我更加神妙完善。亿万人民向我们鼓掌欢呼，也有少数人怏怏不乐，我们是苏联科学的产儿，不是什么“上帝神圣的付托”〔注〕。
    〔注〕1945年美军在长崎投下了原子弹，以为奇货独得，不可一世，把这杀人武器说成是“上帝神圣的付托”。
