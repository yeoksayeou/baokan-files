The experience of the four hundred cadres from Shijingshan Steel Plant going to the countryside is:
    I. Don't walk around the problem, but meet it head-on and uncover the lid;
    II. Big blooming, big contending, and big character posters are the best methods of ideological mobilization;
    III. Create conditions for cadres going to the countryside;
    IV. Political and ideological work cannot only reach the factory gate, but must be brought to the countryside.
    (Reported by our reporter Ye Jianyun) At the beginning of November, 414 cadres from Shijingshan Steel Plant went to the countryside to settle down. Currently, there are still 676 cadres, some of whom will be sent to basic construction sites as laborers, some will go to workshops as apprentices, and some cadres who were originally promoted from workers will return to the workshops to engage in industrial production.
    Drawing a large number of cadres to participate in physical labor was considered a task that was "easy to say, but bound to be fraught with difficulties in execution" just over twenty days ago. Some people also doubted whether this would work.
    Now, this question from more than twenty days ago has a definite answer: The hundreds of cadres who have been sent to the countryside have already begun new and intense labor in their new work posts.
    After the plan for streamlining the organization was determined, new questions were raised for the leading cadres of the steel plant: Where would it be most appropriate to place the large number of cadres who were drawn out? Our country has a vast countryside, where a large amount of labor can be placed, which can be said to be a very good way out. However, at that time, the factory leaders did not seriously think about this issue. The reasons for not thinking about it were twofold. On the one hand, it was believed that the plant had expansion tasks, basic construction needed a batch of labor, and new workshops would also need a batch of people in the future, which could save the trouble of going in and out. On the other hand, it was believed that going to the countryside, although the conditions in the countryside are much better than in the past, it is still sending people who are used to living in the city to the countryside. Therefore, speaking of it, it did not seem so confident.
    The situation of the cadres is like the ten fingers, which are long and short. If they are to be sent to construction sites as laborers, the primary condition is to be strong and young. As for going to the workshop as apprentices, in metallurgical enterprises, the requirements for physique and age are also strict. Among the more than one thousand cadres who were drawn out, two-fifths did not meet these requirements. So what to do? At that time, some people advocated asking the Beijing Municipal People's Committee to help arrange for more than three hundred people. Of course, this was impossible. Under the instructions of the higher-level leaders, they focused on considering the problem they did not originally intend to focus on – going to the countryside.
    How to organize cadres to go to the countryside? Some people advocated simply adopting the method of organizational assignment. This was because they were afraid that everyone would be unwilling to go to the countryside; if everyone was called upon to sign up voluntarily, wouldn't the leaders be put in a passive position if everyone didn't sign up? However, some people also advocated handing the matter over to the masses for discussion. The reason was: among the more than two thousand cadres, one thousand and ninety needed to be sent down, whether to go or stay was itself a problem. Since it is a problem, why go around the problem, why not lay the problem out in front of the masses and let everyone discuss it?
    In the end, it was decided to adopt the latter method. That is, meet it head-on and uncover the problem.
    Uncovering the lid is for the purpose of solving the problem. To solve the problem, first of all, everyone must be allowed to raise the problem. As a result, a new upsurge of big blooming, big contending, and big character posters was set off again.
    The focus of the debate during this period was: whether or not to go to the countryside; whether there was a future in participating in agricultural production; whether it was a waste of talent for educated people to go to the countryside; and what kind of attitude should be used to view the hardship of rural life. Like all debates, at the beginning, the two sides' opinions were sharply opposed. In order to clarify the rights and wrongs, more than five hundred cadres went to the countryside to visit agricultural production cooperatives. Some agricultural cooperatives also sent cadres to give reports. One situation that should be specially mentioned here is that although the Shijingshan Steel Plant is in the suburbs, most of the cadres have never been to the countryside in the past few years. Some cadres were from the countryside, but that was years ago. In their impression, the countryside was always dirty and tiring, cultivating large fields all year round, with limited prospects. In short, many cadres did not have a sufficient understanding of the real situation in the countryside. This time, through debate, especially after the cadres personally visited the countryside, they had a clearer understanding of the living conditions of the peasants and the prospects for agricultural production. Later, they also discussed the revised draft of the agricultural development program and the long-term plan of the "July 1st" agricultural cooperative. Most people believed that although the living conditions in the countryside were not as good as those in the cities, the income of peasants had been increasing year by year; at the same time, China's agriculture, like industry, had infinitely bright prospects. Even those who insisted that there was no future in the countryside, and that it was a waste of talent for intellectuals to go to the countryside, had to admit that the issue of going to the countryside could be considered.
    At this time, some people still believed that they were being sent to the countryside because they were not good enough. Just at this time, many cadres in Beijing had already gone to the countryside to work. These cadres asked themselves: were these people also being sent to the countryside because they were not good enough? The factory leaders also repeatedly explained to everyone that going to the countryside was a need for the development of national production; responding to the call of the state was a very glorious thing.
    After several internal struggles, some people even held family meetings, and many people who firmly demanded to go to the countryside took the lead in posting big character posters, requesting the leadership to approve their going to the countryside. In two or three days, among the 2,500 cadres in the entire factory, excluding 75 people who were out on official business or sick, 2,422 cadres posted big character posters or wrote applications, signing up to go to the countryside.
    99% of the cadres in the entire factory signed up to go to the countryside. Based on needs and possibilities, the factory reviewed the conditions of each cadre going to the countryside and finally approved 414 cadres who met the conditions to go to the countryside. Among them, 138 were graduates of colleges and high schools, 213 were graduates of junior high schools, and 63 had elementary school education. In order to be cautious, opinions were widely solicited from those who had been approved to be sent down. After the list of cadres officially approved to go to the countryside was released, the entire factory dispatched more than 250 cadres to talk to the cadres going to the countryside individually, and stipulated that the head of each department and the secretary of the branch must talk to each of the sent-down personnel in their unit at least once. During the talks, they not only encouraged them to actively engage in agricultural labor in the future, but also sincerely inquired about any difficulties they might encounter after going to the countryside. At the same time, persuasion and education were carried out among their families, and the trade union also helped them plan and arrange their housework.
    The sent-down personnel were very moved by these practices of the factory. Some people who had not joined the Party in the organs expressed that they would actively strive to become a glorious rural Party member after going to the countryside.
    At this time, the sent-down cadres had a correct understanding of going to the agricultural labor front and building a new socialist countryside. However, they also raised many practical issues. For example, how will wages be paid in the future, how will welfare issues be resolved, and how will the issues of housing and food be resolved when going to the countryside? The factory answered these questions one by one. For example, wages and welfare issues will remain the same until Beijing has unified regulations.
    Some people also raised some excessive demands. Such as requesting to connect tap water pipes, install electric lights, distribute 666 powder and fly-killing solution, and distribute basketballs. For these excessive demands that would detach them from the peasant masses, the factory adhered to principles and provided persuasive explanations.
    After the cadres go to the countryside, they will encounter difficulties and inconveniences in a new environment, and it is inevitable that some ideological problems will arise. If there are ideological problems, work must be done. In the beginning, after all, the leaders of the enterprise know more about the ideological situation of the cadres, and the Party committees and Party organizations of the agricultural production cooperatives that accept the sent-down cadres will also be unable to take care of them in the early stages due to the addition of a large number of new members. Under such circumstances, the original enterprise cannot immediately abandon its responsibility to continue to do a good job in political and ideological work.
    The arrangement of Shijingshan Steel Plant in this regard is as follows.
    Among the cadres sent down to the countryside by this factory, there is a secretary of the Communist Youth League Committee, two deputy secretaries of the Party General Branch, a member of the General Branch Committee, a section chief, and a director of education of a spare-time school. These people are leaders and Party members, and in addition to doing the same labor as ordinary sent-down cadres, they have the unshirkable responsibility to carry out political and ideological work. In addition, there are 42 Party members, 17 League members, and some activists who are united around the Party and League, all of whom are forces that regularly carry out political work. In order to help the cooperative do a good job in ideological work, the factory Party committee also decided that the administrative负责人and the Party branch secretary of each department and workshop must go to the countryside regularly to understand the situation of the sent-down personnel and help them solve problems as long as there are sent-down cadres in the unit. The secretary of the factory Party committee, the正副厂长, the chairman of the trade union, and the ministers of the Party committee's organization department and propaganda department also divided the work into four areas, and went down once a week in the early stages. Zhang Ping, secretary of the Party committee, proposed to the comrades who went to the countryside: In the future, the comrades in the factory and the comrades who settled down in the countryside should not only establish comradeship, but also establish kinship.

### 石景山钢铁厂四百干部下乡

    石景山钢铁厂四百干部下乡他们的经验是：
    一、不要绕着问题走，而要迎上去揭开盖子；
    二、大鸣大放大争贴大字报是思想动员的最好方法；
    三、要为下乡的干部创造条件；
    四、政治思想工作不能只做到工厂大门口，必须带到农村去。
    本报讯　记者叶剑韵报道：11月初，石景山钢铁厂有四百一十四名干部下乡落户去了。目前，还有六百七十六名干部，有的将派往基本建设工地去当壮工，有的去车间当学徒，还有一部分原来由工人提拔起来的干部，将回到车间里去从事工业生产。
    抽调大批的干部参加体力劳动，这在二十多天前，人们还把它当成是一件“说来容易，执行起来势必困难重重”的工作。也有人怀疑，这样做行得通吗？
    现在，这个二十多天前的疑问，已经有了肯定的答复：下放到农村去的几百名干部，已经在新的劳动岗位上，开始了新的紧张的劳动。
    紧缩机构的方案确定以后，在钢铁厂的领导干部面前又提出了新的问题：抽调出来的大批干部到底安插在哪里最为合适？我们国家有着辽阔的农村，那里可以安插大量的劳动力，这不能不说是一条很好的出路。但是，在当时，工厂领导方面并没有认真地去想这个问题。所以不去想它，有两方面的原因。一方面认为本厂有扩建任务，基本建设需要一批劳动力，将来新的车间成立了，也需要一批人，这样可以省去一出一入。另一方面，认为下农村去，虽说目前的农村条件比起过去来好多了，可是毕竟是要在城市里住惯了的人下乡。因此，说起话来，似乎不那么理直气壮。
    干部的情况，就像十个指头一样，是有长有短的。如果要他们下工地当壮工，首要条件就是身强力壮，年龄还不能太大。至于下车间当徒工，在冶金企业来说，体格和年龄的要求也是严格的。在这抽调出来的一千多名干部中间，就有五分之二的人是不合这些要求的。那么又怎么办呢？当时有人主张请北京市人民委员会帮助安排三百多名。当然，这是不可能的事。在上级领导同志的指示下，他们就着重考虑原来不打算着重考虑的问题——下农村去。
    怎样组织干部下农村去呢？有人主张干脆采取组织分配的办法。这是因为恐怕大家不愿意到农村去；如果号召大家自动报名，到时候大家不报名，领导上不又陷于被动了吗？但是，也有人主张把事情交给群众去讨论。理由是：二千多名干部中，有一千零九十名需要下放，一是去一是留，这本身就是一个问题。既然是问题，为什么要绕过问题走，为什么不可以把问题在群众面前摊开来，让大家去讨论呢？
    最后，还是决定采用后一种办法。就是迎上去，把问题揭开来。
    揭开盖子，其目的是为了解决问题。要解决问题，首先就得让大家把问题提出来。于是，大放大鸣大争贴大字报的新高潮又掀起来了。
    这个时期争论的中心是：要不要到农村去；参加农业生产有没有前途；有文化的人到农村去是不是屈才；用什么眼光来看农村生活苦的问题。像所有的辩论会一样，开始是两方面的意见针锋相对。为了弄清是非，有五百多名干部下乡去参观了农业生产合作社。有些农业合作社还派了干部来作报告。这里要特别提到的一个情况是，石景山钢铁厂虽然是在郊区，几年来绝大部分干部却从来没有到农村去过。有些干部虽然是从农村来的，但那是几年以前的事。在他们的印象中，农村总是又脏又累，一年四季种大田，前途有限。总之，许多干部对农村的真实情况是不够了解的。这次通过辩论，尤其是干部亲自到农村去参观过以后，他们对农民的生活状况和农业生产的前途认识得比较清楚了。后来，他们还讨论了发展农业纲要修正草案和“七一”农业社的远景规划。多数人认为：现在农村的生活条件虽然还比不上城市，但是这几年农民的收入是在逐年增加；同时，我国的农业和工业一样，有着无限美好的前途。即是那些坚持说农村没有出息的人，说知识分子下农村是屈才的人，至此也不得不承认：下农村去的问题是可以考虑的了。
    这时候，还有一部分人认为：是因为自己不行才被派下乡的。恰好就在这个时候，北京市有许多干部已下乡劳动去了。这些干部自己问自己：难道这些人也是因为他们不行才被派下乡的吗？厂里领导人员也反复向大家说明，下乡是国家发展生产的需要；响应国家号召，是十分光荣的事情。
    经过几番内心斗争，有的人还开了家庭会议，许多坚决要求下乡的人带头贴了大字报，要求领导上批准他们到农村去。在两三天当中，全厂二千五百名干部，除去七十五人因公外出或生病外，有二千四百二十二名干部贴了大字报或者写了申请书，报名要到农村去。
    全厂99％的干部都报了名要到农村去。厂里根据需要和可能，把每一个下乡干部的条件进行了审查，最后批准了四百一十四名条件具备的干部下乡。其中大专和高中学生出身的一百三十八名，初中毕业的二百一十三名，小学程度的六十三名。为了慎重起见，又在批准下放的人员中广泛的征求了意见。在正式批准下乡干部名单以后，全厂出动了二百五十多名干部，和下乡的干部个别谈话，并且规定每个科室的负责人、支部书记，必须对本单位的下放人员每个人最少谈一次话。谈话中间，不仅鼓励他们今后要积极从事农业劳动，而且还诚恳地询问他们下乡以后有什么困难。同时，在家属中也进行了说服教育，工会还帮助她们计划安排了家务。
    下放人员对厂里这些作法十分感动。有些人在机关里没有入党的，表示下农村以后要积极争取做一个光荣的农村党员。
    这时候，下放干部对于到农业劳动战线上去，建设祖国的新农村，已经有了正确的认识。但是，他们也提出了不少的实际问题。例如，今后的工资怎么发，福利问题怎么解决，到农村去住房吃饭的问题怎么办？厂里对这些问题都逐一作了解答。例如，工资福利问题，在北京市没有作统一规定以前，仍然照旧。
    也有一部分人提出了一些过高的要求。如要求接自来水管子，安电灯，发六六六粉、杀蝇子的药水，发篮球等。对于这些过高的、会脱离农民群众的要求，厂里都坚持原则，作了说服解释。
    干部下乡以后，换了一个新的环境，困难和不便一定是会碰到的，产生一些思想问题也在所难免。有思想问题，就得做工作。开始的时候，毕竟企业的领导对干部的思想情况了解得多，接受下放干部地区的党委和农业生产合作社的党组织，由于社里增添了大批的新成员，初期，他们也会照顾不过来。在这样的情况下，原属企业就不能马上放弃继续做好政治思想工作的责任。
    石景山钢铁厂在这方面的安排是这样的。
    这个厂下放到农村的干部中，有一个共青团团委书记，两个党总支副书记，一个总支委员，一个科长，一个业余学校的教务主任。这些人是领导人又是党员，他们除了和一般下放干部同样劳动以外，义不容辞地要进行政治思想工作。此外，还有四十二名党员，十七名团员和一些团结在党团周围的积极分子，他们都是经常进行政治工作的力量。为了帮助合作社做好思想工作，工厂党委会还决定：每个科室、车间，只要是本单位有下放干部的，这个单位的行政负责人和党支部书记，必须定期下乡，了解下放人员的情况，并且帮助他们解决问题。厂里的党委书记、正副厂长、工会主席、党委组织部部长和宣传部部长，也分工管四个片，开始时期，每个星期下去一次。党委书记张萍同志向到农村去的同志们提出：今后工厂的同志和在农村落户的同志不仅要建立同志的感情，还要建立起亲戚的感情。
