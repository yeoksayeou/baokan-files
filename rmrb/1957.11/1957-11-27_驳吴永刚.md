Shanghai Film Studio director Wu Yonggang has always boasted that he is a person who has "followed the Party for thirty years" and is a "patriot"; however, through this anti-rightist struggle, his true face has been completely exposed.

Wu Yonggang's anti-Party and anti-socialist conspiratorial activities were programmed, planned, and carried out step-by-step. After the rectification movement began, he discovered that the Shanghai Democratic League, which had been usurped by rightists, could become a tool for him to carry out anti-Party activities and could be used to "counter organizations with organizations." He immediately joined the Democratic League and frantically attacked the Party and the revolutionary cause at the five symposiums held by the Democratic League at the Shanghai Film Studio. He said that the current social system is not good, that everything is dogmatism, and that even daily life is full of dogmas. He pounded the table and demanded that Sima Rui stand up, because this person named Sima Rui had criticized the erroneous viewpoints in the Wenhui Bao's film discussion. He also described this matter as the Party blocking mouths. He cursed the leaders of the Shanghai Film Studio as "mediocre" and "laymen," and scolded Party members and activists as people who "live by making small reports." He stated that "the film industry is about to have a revolution." After the symposium, Wu Yonggang went around canvassing people, proposing that the film studio be run by the Democratic League, and offered advice to Shen Zhiyuan, urging him to adopt his plan.

Wu Yonggang also used the guise of opposing dogmatism to oppose the Party's leadership over the film industry. As early as December 7, 1956, Wu Yonggang published an extremely malicious anti-Party article in Wenhui Bao entitled "Political Commentary Cannot Replace Art." After the rectification movement began, he successively published two articles, "Feelings After the Spring Breeze Thaws" (Xinmin Evening News, May 5, 1957) and "Jottings on Thawing" (Wenhui Bao, May 13, 1957). In the article "Political Commentary Cannot Replace Art," Wu Yonggang smeared films made after liberation as "vitamin pills" without "color, aroma, and taste," as "dogmas," and as "political commentary." In his writing, it was as if the film leadership in the past had really advocated using "dogmas" and "political commentary" to replace art. In fact, in recent years, the leadership has been constantly helping creative personnel to overcome the tendency of formulaic and conceptual creation, opposing the simplification of expressing life, and opposing the diagrammatic interpretation of policies. It is precisely under the Party's care and help that we have been able to produce more excellent films year after year. However, Wu Yonggang lightly dismissed all the achievements of the film industry in the eight years since liberation.

In the two articles "Feelings After the Spring Breeze Thaws" and "Jottings on Thawing," first of all, Wu Yonggang tried his best to distort the lives of intellectuals after liberation as being extremely painful and embarrassing, saying that "the weather is fickle, and there are always some concerns when putting on clothes every day. If you wear too much, you're afraid of being hot, and if you wear too little, you're afraid of catching a cold." In fact, Wu Yonggang himself has personally experienced the political liberation and improvement of the lives of intellectuals after liberation, but he insisted on reversing black and white.

Next, he used Qing Dynasty writer Gong Ding'an's "Record of the Sick Plum Studio" as a metaphor to slander the film art after liberation as "sick plums." And he arrogantly clamored to "treat, indulge, obey, untie, destroy the pot, bury in the ground, and let it open freely" these "sick plums."

Wu Yonggang's purpose was to direct the spearhead at the Party's leadership and the socialist system through these distortions and slanders. In these two articles, he also said, "Some people regard themselves as flower protectors... using methods of pulling up seedlings to help them grow and harming their roots to deal with delicate artistic problems, that is, using dogmatism to treat delicate artistic leadership problems." He also said, "Under the dogmatic rules and regulations, all flowers and plants must grow according to their dogmas, and thus produce formulaic and conceptual flowers and fruits." He also fabricated "burning down the '-ism' with a fire" and "chopping down the '-ism' with a hoe," etc., to slander today's film leadership.

In these articles, Wu Yonggang also put forward a whole set of anti-Party literary and artistic programs.

One of Wu Yonggang's anti-Party literary and artistic programs is that he openly put forward the slogan of so-called "releasing whatever one wants to release and speaking whatever one wants to speak," which is directly opposed to Chairman Mao's six criteria. He advocated treating poisons as flowers. He said, "If poppies appear in our garden, we should first understand that they are beautiful and pleasing flowers." As long as they are "beautiful and pleasing," even if they contain highly poisonous opium, he advocates "releasing whatever one wants to release and speaking whatever one wants to speak." Anyone who points out that this is poison and opposes it, he thinks is "dogmatism" and a simple and crude "burning down the '-ism' with a fire" and "chopping down the '-ism' with a hoe."

Wu Yonggang's second anti-Party literary and artistic program is that he attempts to replace the Party's orientation towards literature and art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers with his "color, aroma, and taste" "artistic direction." In those articles, Wu Yonggang mentioned "artistic direction" more than once; however, he never clearly stated what that artistic direction was. Here, he played a trick, trying to steal the Party's orientation of literature and art for the workers, peasants, and soldiers with his "color, aroma, and taste" "artistic direction." He opposes films focusing on reflecting the current major struggles and real life—especially the lives of workers, peasants, and soldiers—and advocates making more folk tale films. The reasons are: first, folk tales cannot be filled with "dogmas"; second, they sell well; third, they save effort and trouble. It is necessary to appropriately shoot some films with folk tales as the subject matter. In recent years, when formulating the annual production plan, the leadership has given folk tales and adaptations of classical masterpieces a certain proportion. Wasn't "The Fairy Couple," which was warmly welcomed by the audience, also produced with the support of the leadership? Wu Yonggang's advocacy of specializing in folk tale films is actually opposing the direction of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Because Wu Yonggang knows that the masses' awareness is increasing day by day after liberation, it is difficult to promote bourgeois reactionary ideas head-on, and "folk tales" can become his air-raid shelter, which can not only avoid expressing the spirit of socialism but also cleverly peddle his private goods. He did just this when filming "The Tale of Qiu Weng's Encounter with Immortals." He not only adapted this short story, which is full of poetry and strong people-oriented spirit, into a vulgar and unbearable one but also used the plot of Zhang Yanei asking people to hoe up and burn the peony in the play to vent his personal grievances.

Wu Yonggang's third anti-Party literary and artistic program is to oppose the Party's leadership over the film industry and advocate the so-called absolute freedom of the bourgeoisie. It is easy to understand why Wu Yonggang has such anti-Party ideas. Before liberation, he could freely sing praises to the Kuomintang reactionaries, and he could freely plagiarize Chinese and foreign masterpieces, repackage them, and release them as his own "masterpieces"... These "freedoms" were indeed restricted after liberation. We regard film as part of the Party's revolutionary cause, but he sees it as a personal career that can be arbitrarily done; we advocate seriously treating creation, but what he likes is shoddy work; we believe that adapting classical masterpieces and folk tales must be faithful to the people-oriented nature of the original work and promote it, but he wants to use folk tales to promote the decadent ideas of the bourgeoisie! How can such "freedom" not be restricted?

Wu Yonggang boasts that he is a "patriot" who has "followed the Party for thirty years" and a "tough bone." Facts have proved that he is a spineless person who humbles himself to the bourgeois reactionaries. Before liberation, he had relied on Zhang Shankun (a big gangster, a big traitor, and a cultural special agent with mountains of crimes) and Luo Xuelian (the manager of the puppet Central Film Studio). After liberation, he still remembers them and often tells people about their "benevolence."

From 1934 to 1949, Wu Yonggang made nearly thirty films in total. Except for the fact that the Left-Wing Drama League helped him through comrades such as Tian Han, Xia Yan, and Nie Er, which enabled him to make two relatively progressive films, "The Goddess" in 1934 and "Lofty Ambitions" in 1936, and gave him a certain reputation in the film industry, all the other twenty or so films promoted reactionary ideas, eroded the people's fighting will, and sang praises to the Kuomintang reactionaries. Especially when the revolution was severely damaged and the white terror was increasing day by day, this so-called "patriotic" "tough bone" immediately revealed his opportunistic broker's face and made many films that promoted reactionary ideas and catered to the reactionaries. For example, in 1936, when the Kuomintang reactionaries adopted a policy of compromise and surrender to Japan and launched a large-scale attack on the Shaanxi-Gansu border area, he made "Waves Washing the Sand" to erode the people's revolutionary will with nihilistic ideas. Later, he made yellow and vulgar films such as "Rouge Tears," "Huanghai Bandit," "Red Powder and Golden Spears," and "The Oil Seller Occupies the Top Courtesan," to numb the people. After Shanghai fell, he crudely made many so-called folk tale films, including "Loyalty to the Country," which wrote about Yue Fei. In order to win the favor of the traitorous masters, he did not hesitate to delete the most important conflict in Yue Fei's life—the conflict with Qin Hui—in order to cater to the hearts of the Japanese who occupied Shanghai, the traitor Wang Jingwei, and scum like Zhang Shankun. After the end of the Anti-Japanese War, he rejected the invitation of the Shanghai Drama and Art Society led by the Party and went to the puppet Central Film Studio run by the Kuomintang and wrote, directed, and produced the film "A Loyal and Righteous Family," which promoted the Kuomintang's orthodox ideology and encouraged the masses to be loyal and righteous to the Kuomintang reactionaries. In this film, he also employed some actors whose identities during the enemy and puppet regime had not yet been clarified, despite the protests of the vast majority of film workers. From these facts, isn't it clear what kind of "patriot" and what kind of "tough bone" Wu Yonggang is!

    驳吴永刚	艾明之
    上海电影制片公司导演吴永刚，一向夸耀自己是“追随党三十年”的人，是“爱国主义者”；但是通过这次反右派斗争，他的真实面目却彻底暴露了。
    吴永刚反党、反社会主义的阴谋活动是有纲领、有计划、有步骤的。整风运动开始后，他发现被右派所篡夺的上海民盟可以成为他进行反党活动的工具，可以“以组织对抗组织”，他立刻参加了民盟。并且在民盟在上海电影制片公司召开的五次座谈会上，猖狂地向党、向革命事业进攻。他说现在的社会制度不好，一切都是教条主义，连日常生活也充满了教条；他拍着桌子要司马瑞站出来，因为这位署名司马瑞的人对文汇报的电影讨论中的错误论点作了批评；他并且把这件事说成是党在堵嘴；他骂上影的领导是“庸才”，是“外行”，骂党员和积极分子是“靠打小报告为生”的人。他表示“电影界要革命了”。座谈会以后，吴永刚就四面八方拉拢人，提出要由民盟来办厂，并且向沈志远献策，要沈志远采纳他这个计划。
    吴永刚还打着反对教条主义的幌子，来反对党对电影事业的领导。早在1956年12月7日，吴永刚就在文汇报上发表了一篇极其恶毒的反党文章“政论不能代替艺术”。整风运动开始以后，他又连续抛出了“春风解冻有感”（1957年5月5日新民报晚刊）和“解冻随感录”（1957年5月13日文汇报）两篇文章。在“政论不能代替艺术”一文里，吴永刚把解放后的电影诬蔑为没有“色香味”的“维他命丸子”，是“教条”，是“政论”。在他的笔底好像过去电影领导真的曾主张过要用“教条”和“政论”来代替艺术品一样。事实上，这些年来，领导上一直不断地在帮助创作人员努力克服创作上的公式化、概念化倾向，反对在表现生活时的简单化倾向，反对图解政策。正是在党的关怀和帮助下，我们才能一年比一年更多地产生出了优秀的影片。但是，吴永刚却轻轻一笔就把解放八年来的电影的成绩全部否定了。
    在“春风解冻有感”和“解冻随感录”这两篇文章中，首先，吴永刚极力把解放后知识分子的生活歪曲成十分痛苦和狼狈的样子，说什么“天气是乍暖还寒，每天穿衣服的时候总有一些顾虑。穿多了怕热，穿少了又怕着冷。”事实上，解放后，知识分子的政治解放和生活改善，连吴永刚本人也亲身经历过的，然而他偏要颠倒黑白。
    接着，他又借清人龚定盦的“病梅馆记”作隐喻，把解放后的电影艺术诬蔑为“病梅”。并且狂妄地叫嚣，要对这些“病梅”加以“疗之，纵之，顺之，解其缚，毁其盆，埋于地，让其自由开放。”
    吴永刚的目的是通过这些歪曲和中伤，把锋芒引向党的领导和社会主义制度。在这两篇文章中，他还说，“有些人以护花使者自命……用拔苗助长、戕贼生根的方法来处理细致的艺术问题，也就是用教条主义对待细致的艺术领导问题。”又说，“在教条主义者的清规戒律下，一切花花草草，都要按照他们的教条来成长，于是就产生了公式化、概念化的花果。”他又捏造出什么“一把火烧掉主义”和“一锄头砍掉主义”等等来诬蔑今天的电影领导。
    吴永刚在他这几篇文章中也提出了一整套反党的文艺纲领。
    吴永刚反党的文艺纲领之一是，他公开提出了和毛主席的六项标准针锋相对的所谓“放所欲放、鸣所欲鸣”的口号。他提倡把毒品当作鲜花。他说“我们的园地里出现了罂粟花，我们首先该了解，它是美丽悦目的花卉”，只要“美丽悦目”，即使是含有剧毒的鸦片，他也是主张“放所欲放、鸣所欲鸣”的。谁要是指出这是毒品，加以反对，他就认为是“教条主义”，是简单而粗暴的“一把火烧掉主义”和“一锄头砍掉主义”。
    吴永刚反党的文艺纲领之二是，他妄图用他的“色香味”的“文艺方向”来代替党的工农兵文艺方向。在那几篇文章中，吴永刚曾不止一次地提到“文艺方向”；但他绝不明确说明那是什么文艺方向。在这里，他耍了一个花招，企图把自己的“色香味”的“文艺方向”来偷换党的工农兵文艺方向。他反对电影应该着重反映当前的重大斗争和现实生活——特别是工农兵的生活，而主张多拍民间故事片。理由是：一，民间故事装不进“教条”；二，卖座；三，省力省事。适当地拍摄一些以民间故事为题材的影片是需要的。这几年来，领导上在拟定每年的摄制计划时，都给民间故事及古典名著的改编占一定的比例。受到观众热烈欢迎的“天仙配”，不也是在领导上的支持下摄制出来的么？吴永刚提倡专门拍民间故事片，实际上是反对工农兵方向。因为吴永刚知道解放后群众的觉悟一天一天在提高，要正面宣传资产阶级反动思想是困难的，而“民间故事”却可以成为他的防空洞，既可以不必表现社会主义的精神，又可以巧妙地贩卖他的私货。在拍“秋翁遇仙记”时，他就是这样做的。他不仅把这篇诗意浓郁、人民性很强的短篇小说，改编得庸俗不堪，而且还别有用心地借剧中人张衙内叫人把牡丹锄掉、烧掉等情节来宣泄他的私愤。
    吴永刚反党的文艺纲领之三是，反对党对电影事业的领导，提倡资产阶级的所谓绝对自由。吴永刚所以有这样的反党思想，是容易理解的。解放前，他可以自由地为国民党反动派歌功颂德，他可以自由地剽窃中外名著，改头换面后当作自己的“杰作”出笼，……这些“自由”解放后的确受到了限制。我们把电影作为党的革命事业的一部分，他却看作是可以任意为之的个人事业；我们提倡严肃地对待创作，他喜欢的却是粗制滥造；我们认为改编古典名著和民间故事，必须忠实于原著的人民性并加以发扬，他却想借民间故事宣传资产阶级的腐朽思想！这样的“自由”怎能不受限制呢？
    吴永刚自诩是“追随党三十年”的“爱国主义者”，是一个“硬骨头”。事实证明，他却是一个向资产阶级反动派卑躬屈膝的软骨头。解放前，他曾投靠过张善琨（大流氓、大汉奸和罪行如山的文化特务）和罗学濂（伪中央电影制片厂总管理处经理）。解放后，他还对他们念念不忘，经常向人宣传他们的“恩泽”。
    吴永刚从1934年到1949年，一共摄制了近三十部电影，除了左翼“剧联”通过田汉、夏衍、聂耳等许多同志对他进行了帮助，使他在1934年摄制了“神女”，1936年摄制了“壮志凌云”两部比较进步的电影，并使他在电影界中获得一定声誉外，其余二十多部影片，全都是宣传反动思想，消蚀人民斗争意志，为国民党反动派歌功颂德的。特别是在革命受到严重摧残，白色恐怖日益增涨的时候，这个所谓“爱国主义”的“硬骨头”，立刻显露出他那投机掮客的嘴脸，摄制了许多宣传反动思想，逢迎反动派的电影。如1936年，当国民党反动派对日本采取了妥协投降政策，大举进攻陕北根据地的时候，他摄制了“浪淘沙”，以虚无主义思想消损人民的革命斗志。以后他又摄制了如“胭脂泪”、“黄海大盗”、“红粉金戈”、“卖油郎独占花魁女”等等黄色、庸俗的电影，麻醉人民。在上海沦陷后，他又粗制滥造地摄制出许多所谓民间故事的影片，其中如写岳飞的“精忠报国”，为了博得汉奸主子的欢心，他不惜把岳飞一生中最重要的冲突——和秦桧的冲突删去，以迎合当时侵占上海的日本人、汉奸汪精卫及张善琨等败类的心意。抗日战争结束以后，他拒绝了党领导的上海剧艺社的邀请，去投靠国民党办的伪中央电影制片厂，并自编自导摄制了宣传国民党正统思想、鼓动群众向国民党反动派尽忠尽义的电影“忠义之家”。在这部电影中，他还不顾广大电影工作者的抗议，起用了一些在敌伪时期的身份还没有搞清楚的演员。从这些事实来看，吴永刚到底是什么样的“爱国主义者”，是什么样的“硬骨头”，不是昭然若揭了么！
