    Xinhua News Agency, 19th dispatch from New York: The United Nations General Assembly Political Committee concluded its discussion on the Korean question at its morning meeting on the 18th.

    The meeting ultimately passed the proposal put forward by the United States and ten other countries with fifty-three votes. Representatives of the Soviet Union, Ukraine, Belarus, Albania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, and Romania voted against it. Representatives of Afghanistan, Burma, Cambodia, Ceylon, Egypt, Finland, Haiti, Indonesia, Morocco, Nepal, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Syria, Yemen, and Yugoslavia abstained. The representative of India did not participate in the voting.

    Before the proposal was passed, the U.S. representative, Mr. Chou Yi-te, in his speech, demanded that the Korean question be resolved in accordance with the eleven-nation proposal. He admitted that the United States, disregarding the constraints of the Korean Armistice Agreement, was strengthening its military strength in South Korea. At the same time, he slandered the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and China, fabricating lies about the DPRK and China undermining the Armistice Agreement.

    The Soviet representative, Sobolev, in his speech, accused the United States of attempting to use the United Nations to cover up and defend its policies and war preparations in Korea. He said that the eleven-nation proposal was essentially no different from previous proposals. This proposal once again attempted to obliterate the existence of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and its aim was to extend the Syngman Rhee puppet regime to the entire Korean peninsula. He said that those who are now plotting to undermine the Korean Armistice Agreement are hoping to resolve the Korean question by force. Sobolev pointed out that it was the United States that wantonly undermined the Korean Armistice Agreement. The United States announced that it would ship an unlimited amount of modern armaments, including nuclear weapons, to South Korea in the future.

    Sobolev said that the only correct attitude for resolving the issue of Korean unification should be: maintaining the armistice and turning it into a consolidated peace; the Koreans themselves should establish and expand political, economic, and cultural ties between North and South Korea, which would ultimately lead to a unified Korea and a democratic and peace-loving country.

    Sobolev also pointed out that the U.S. representative's slander against China in his speech was not surprising because Chou Yi-te was an active participant in the "Million Signature Committee," which aims to hinder the People's Republic of China from entering the United Nations, namely, a participant in an organization that cultivates hostility towards the new China and the Chinese people among the American people.

    The representative of Bolivia also stated in his speech that the U.S. proposal did not contain any factors that could promote the resolution of the Korean question based on the interests of the Korean people. The representative of Nepal said that the U.S. proposal did not contain any new content that would help resolve the Korean question.

### 苏联代表在联大政委会指出  美国企图武力解决朝鲜问题  会议通过不利朝鲜统一的十一国提案

    苏联代表在联大政委会指出
    美国企图武力解决朝鲜问题
    会议通过不利朝鲜统一的十一国提案
    新华社19日讯　纽约消息：联合国大会政治委员会18日上午会议结束了朝鲜问题的讨论。
    会议最后以五十三票通过了美国等十一国提出的提案。苏联，乌克兰，白俄罗斯，阿尔巴尼亚，保加利亚，捷克斯洛伐克，匈牙利，波兰和罗马尼亚九国代表投票反对。阿富汗，缅甸，柬埔寨，锡兰，埃及，芬兰，海地，印度尼西亚，摩洛哥，尼泊尔，沙特阿拉伯，苏丹，叙利亚，也门和南斯拉夫十五国代表弃权。印度代表没有参加表决。
    在通过提案之前，美国代表周以德在发言中要求根据十一国提案解决朝鲜问题，他承认美国不顾朝鲜停战协定的约束，正在加强在南朝鲜的军事实力，但同时他对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和中国进行诬蔑，捏造朝中方面破坏停战协定的谎言。
    苏联代表索波列夫在发言中指责美国企图利用联合国来掩盖和辩护它在朝鲜的政策和战争准备。他说，现在十一国提案实质上同以前的提案并无半点区别，这个提案再一次企图抹杀朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的存在，它所追求的目的是要把李承晚傀儡制度推广到全朝鲜。他说，现在阴谋破坏朝鲜停战协定的人正在希望把朝鲜问题寄托于武力解决。索波列夫指出，正是美国肆意破坏了朝鲜停战协定。美国宣布今后将向南朝鲜运送数量不限的现代化军备，其中包括原子武装。
    索波列夫说，解决统一朝鲜问题的唯一正确的态度应该是：保持停战状态并使它转为巩固的和平；由朝鲜人自己来建立和扩大南北朝鲜之间的政治、经济和文化联系，这样最后就会使朝鲜统一，成为民主的爱好和平的国家。
    索波列夫还指出，美国代表在他的发言中对中国的诽谤是不足为怪的，这是因为周以德是旨在阻挠中华人民共和国进入联合国的“百万人签名委员会”的积极参加者，即在美国人民中间培植对新中国及对中国人民的敌意的组织的参加者。
    玻利维亚的代表在发言中也认为美国提案并没有能促使在朝鲜人民利益的基础上解决朝鲜问题的因素。尼泊尔代表说，美国提案没有任何新的能有助于解决朝鲜问题的内容。
