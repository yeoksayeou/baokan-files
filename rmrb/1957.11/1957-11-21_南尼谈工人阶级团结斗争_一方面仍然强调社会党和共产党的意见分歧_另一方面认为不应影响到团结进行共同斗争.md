Xinhua News Agency, Rome, 19th Dispatch: Italian Socialist Party General Secretary Nenni published a signed editorial in "Avanti!" regarding the recent resolution passed by the Socialist Party Central Committee plenary session.

Nenni wrote: "The significance of the differences of opinion between Socialists and Communists on fundamental issues of the Italian and international socialist movement far exceeds the scope of daily struggles. However, these differences should not affect the necessity and obligation for us to strive for the unity of all workers, people, and democratic forces to carry out a common struggle. In any case, attempting to exclude Communists and the Communist Party is an unrealistic approach, because in our country and France, doing so would be tantamount to completely handing over political power to conservative bourgeois groups."

In this editorial, Nenni also discussed the issue of the so-called "third force" taking a middle road. He said: Due to the illusion that a third force exists, the Christian Democratic Party in Italy has monopolized political power. The Central Committee is fully aware of the seriousness of the situation, and therefore it is fully responsible for regarding the Christian Democrats as enemies that must be fought. However, this is by no means because they are Catholics, but because they are tools for the churchification of the state and schools, because they are agents of domestic and foreign monopoly organizations, and executors of domestic and foreign capitalist policies.

Note: The Italian Socialist Party agreed to conclude a "United Action Pact" with the Italian Communist Party as early as the anti-fascist struggle in the 1930s. After the Socialist Party Central Committee plenary session in June last year raised the issue of merging the Socialist Party with the Social Democratic Party headed by Saragat, Saragat insisted that the merger must be premised on ceasing cooperation with the Communist Party. At the Socialist Party Central Committee meeting in November last year, Nenni advocated changing the close ties with the Communist Party. He said that the relationship between the Socialist Party and the Communists would no longer be resolved by any agreement, but would be resolved within the scope of mutual non-binding. Subsequently, the Socialist Party continued negotiations with the Social Democratic Party. Nenni also repeatedly issued statements emphasizing the possibility of merging with the Social Democratic Party. However, the Socialist Party Congress held in February this year showed that many people within the party still advocated continuing cooperation with the Communist Party and opposed merging with the Social Democratic Party on the premise of anti-communism. In April this year, the merger negotiations broke down, and the Socialist Party formally rejected the Social Democratic Party's condition of severing relations with the Communist Party to achieve the merger. After this, Nenni announced at the party's Central Committee plenary session on May 9 this year: Although the Socialist Party believes that "its form of unity and organic links with the Communists" is outdated, the Socialist Party "opposes all suggestions to break with the Communists, and opposes abandoning cooperation with the Communists in cases where there is agreement."

    南尼谈工人阶级团结斗争
    一方面仍然强调社会党和共产党的意见分歧
    另一方面认为不应影响到团结进行共同斗争
    新华社19日讯　罗马消息：意大利社会党总书记南尼就社会党中央全会最近通过的决议在“前进报”上发表了一篇署名的社论。
    南尼写道：“社会党人和共产党人对意大利和国际社会主义运动基本问题意见分歧的意义远远超出日常斗争的范围。但是这种分歧不应当影响我们争取团结全体工人、人民和民主力量来进行共同斗争的必要性和义务。在任何情况下，排除共产党员和共产党的企图都是不现实的作法，因为在我国和法国这样做就等于把政权完全奉送给保守的资产阶级集团。”
    南尼在这篇社论中还谈到所谓走中间路线的“第三种力量”的问题。他说：由于有人幻想有第三种力量存在，在意大利已经导致了天主教民主党对政权的垄断。中央委员会充分意识到局势的严重性，因此它完全有责任把天主教民主党人当作必须与之作斗争的敌人。但是，这绝不是由于他们是天主教徒，而是因为他们是国家和学校教会化的工具，因为他们是本国和外国垄断组织的代理人，本国和外国资本主义的政策的执行人。
    按：意大利社会党早在三十年代的反法西斯斗争中就同意大利共产党缔结了“统一行动公约”。去年6月社会党中央全会上提出社会党同以萨拉盖特为首的社会民主党合并的问题以后，萨拉盖特坚持合并必须以停止同共产党合作为前提。在去年11月社会党中央会议上，南尼主张改变同共产党的紧密联系。他说，社会党同共产党人的关系将不再能用任何协议来解决，而将放在彼此互不约束的范围内加以解决。随后社会党同社会民主党继续进行了谈判。南尼并且屡次发表声明强调同社会民主党合并的可能性。但是今年2月举行的社会党代表大会表明，党内有许多人仍然主张继续同共产党合作并且反对在反共的前提下同社会民主党合并。今年4月间，合并的谈判宣告破裂，社会党正式拒绝了社会民主党要求同共产党断绝关系以实现合并的条件。这以后，南尼才在今年5月9日党的中央全会上宣布：尽管社会党认为“它同共产党人的团结形式和有机联系”已经过时，但是社会党“反对同共产党人决裂的一切建议，反对在意见一致的情况下仍然放弃同共产党人合作的一切建议”。
