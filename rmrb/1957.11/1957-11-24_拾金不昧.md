Honesty in Picking Up Things

Many people in Changsha are talking about the honest act of Gu Yufan, a worker at the tricycle cooperative, who picked up money and didn't keep it. On October 28th, Gu Yufan found a small black bag on his tricycle, containing five gold rings, a pair of gold earrings, and two gold buttons from a coat, weighing about two taels in total. In addition, there was about one jin of valuable Chinese medicine, Tianma, and 820 yuan in Renminbi. After Gu Yufan found the bag, he immediately took it to the tricycle cooperative office, so that the lost property was returned to its owner in a timely manner.

Gu Yufan is a resident of Gaozheng Street in Changsha City. His family of three relies entirely on him pulling a tricycle to make a living. He has picked up valuable items on his tricycle several times and immediately sent them to the tricycle cooperative office.
