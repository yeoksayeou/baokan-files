Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 2nd: The Tuo River basin in Sichuan Province recently saw the emergence of seventy agricultural cooperatives that averaged 10,000 jin of sugarcane per mu, with the highest yields on several mu reaching over 30,000 jin per mu. This is the highest record in the area.

The Tuo River basin is rich in sugarcane, but past yields have not been high, with no yields exceeding 10,000 jin per mu. After agricultural cooperativization, yields soared. This year, the cooperatives summarized their experiences from the past few years, absorbed advanced technologies from Fujian, Guangdong, and other places, expanded the use of superior varieties, practiced intensive cultivation and meticulous farming, and increased fertilization. Many cooperatives also specifically established high-yield teams and high-yield groups to foster high yields to drive the laggards, finally achieving the above results.

The emergence of these high-yield records has greatly boosted the production enthusiasm of the broad masses of sugarcane farmers and helped to overcome conservative thinking. Some members of the Shunjiang Cooperative in Shidong Township, Neijiang County, previously lacked confidence in whether the originally set high-yield targets could be achieved. This time, forty mu of sugarcane in this cooperative averaged over 20,000 jin, and after the cooperative organized them to visit the fields, they were all very excited. The entire cooperative decided to increase production by another 30% next year on the basis of this year.

    沱江流域甘蔗大丰收
    出现七十个万斤社
    新华社成都2日电　四川省沱江流域最近出现七十个平均每亩产一万斤甘蔗的农业社，其中最高的几亩地每亩产量达到三万斤以上。这是这一地区最高纪录。
    沱江流域盛产甘蔗，但过去产量一向不高，没有亩产万斤以上的。农业合作化后产量突飞猛进。今年各社总结了过去几年的经验，吸收了福建、广东等地的先进技术，扩大良种、精耕细作、增加施肥，许多社还特地建立了高产队、高产组培养高产带动落后，终于获得以上的成绩。
    这些高产纪录的出现，对鼓舞广大蔗农生产积极性和克服保守思想都有很大作用。内江县史东乡顺江社有些社员过去对原定的高产指标能否实现缺乏信心。这次这个社有四十亩甘蔗平均产量在二万斤以上，社内组织他们参观后都很兴奋。全社决定明年在今年的基础上再增产30％。
