    Overcome All Difficulties and Resolutely Complete the Task of Removing Cottonseed Lint
    By a Commentator of this Newspaper
    Since the State Council issued instructions in mid-August on developing short-fiber cotton production, Party committees and governments at all levels have attached great importance to it, actively urging supply and marketing cooperatives to prepare various delinting equipment and take various measures to increase the purchase of seed cotton, mobilizing and organizing forces from all sides to do this work. However, many problems have emerged in the previous stage of work that need to be resolved immediately.
    According to reports from various places, the most common problem in this work is that delinting technology cannot keep up with the needs of the work, and there is a considerable lack of necessary technical personnel, so that the cottonseeds ginned in many places cannot be delinted in time, or the short-fiber rate is very low. This problem deserves sufficient attention. All localities should immediately organize and train technical forces in a planned way and earnestly strengthen technical guidance for delinting work. At present, many regions have already transferred some personnel to teach them delinting technology by means of crash courses, or adopted methods of masters leading apprentices and holding technical exchange meetings to train technical personnel, thereby effectively solving the problem of insufficient technical strength. These methods should continue to be promoted in various places. Currently, there are still two issues in this regard that need to be well resolved. One issue is that some places still lack personnel with relatively complex technical skills, and it is difficult to train these personnel through short-term training. This requires Party committees and governments at all levels to immediately transfer a group of necessary technical personnel from other departments to support the production of short-fiber cotton. The other issue is that the technical guidance work for agricultural cooperatives and farmers who are capable of delinting short-fiber cotton has not kept up in time, and this work should also be carried out seriously. In order to solve the shortage of delinting technical forces, various localities can also transfer a group of mobile technical personnel to go to cotton processing factories, oil pressing factories, and rural areas to provide roving guidance.
    Resolving the contradiction between cottonseed delinting and the supply of ginned cotton, and between cottonseed delinting and cottonseed oil pressing, is also an important issue in doing a good job in delinting at present. In previous years, after the purchasing departments acquired seed cotton, they sent it to the ginneries for processing, and immediately transferred the ginned cotton to textile factories, while transferring the cottonseeds to oil factories for oil pressing. This year, the situation has changed, and cottonseeds must first have the lint removed before oil pressing. At present, China's delinting machine equipment is far from meeting the requirements of the delinting task. In order to remove more lint before cottonseed oil pressing, some regions have to draw out some ginneries for delinting; thus, it affects the processing and supply of ginned cotton. At the same time, due to the lack of delinting equipment, the cottonseeds after ginning cannot be quickly and completely delinted, which affects cottonseed oil pressing. These two contradictions should be resolved in the spirit of mutual accommodation: (1) Actively draw out some ginneries for delinting on the premise of not affecting the allocation and supply of ginned cotton. That is to say, we should first select places with good delinting conditions and high productivity to draw out a part of the ginneries to participate in delinting production, and let other places fully meet the supply of ginned cotton. (2) For cottonseeds, we should still implement the principle of delinting before oil pressing. In areas with many oilseed varieties, we should first arrange other oilseeds to be pressed before the new year; oil pressing factories should also give priority to absorbing cottonseeds scattered among the masses for delinting, and strive to process the cottonseeds in the hands of the state later, so as to remove more lint. If delinting seriously affects the production of oil pressing factories in some places, some undelinted cottonseeds should be allocated to the oil pressing factories for oil pressing according to needs; however, all localities should make overall arrangements for cottonseed oil pressing work, and first transfer the surplus cottonseeds from areas with poor delinting conditions and fewer tasks to be pressed for oil.
    At present, some regions plan to install delinting machines in urban oil pressing factories and combine them with oil pressing factories, in order to utilize the power and equipment of the oil pressing factories and save state investment. This method needs to be considered. Because simply calculating from the investment in delinting equipment, it is of course better to be attached to an oil pressing factory. However, if rural cottonseeds are transported to cities, and then oil cakes and part of the oil are transported back to rural areas, the increased costs in between will exceed the savings on equipment, and the state will suffer losses when the overall account is calculated, and it will also be detrimental to agricultural production. Therefore, ginneries, delinting factories, and oil pressing factories should be mainly set up in rural areas for easy integration. Of course, the existing oil pressing factories in cities should still be given appropriate consideration in terms of raw material supply.
    In some places, there is also a contradiction between farmers selling seed cotton and selling ginned cotton. It is very important for the state to control a large amount of cottonseeds in order to complete the delinting task. At present, many farmers in many regions have actively responded to the call of the state and enthusiastically sold seed cotton to the state, so that the state has mastered a lot of cottonseeds. However, in some other regions, such as Shanxi, Shaanxi, Sichuan, etc., farmers do not sell much seed cotton to the state. Farmers in these regions have always processed ginned cotton by themselves and sold it to the state. Asking farmers in these regions to sell more seed cotton to the state is related to their habits and interests; at the same time, the purchasing departments in these places also lack the necessary ginning equipment, and excessive seed cotton purchases will affect the supply of ginned cotton. Therefore, all localities should adopt different measures according to different circumstances. It is of course good to purchase more seed cotton if possible; otherwise, they can also actively find ways to ensure that the lint can be removed from the cottonseeds in the hands of farmers.
    The production of power equipment and auxiliary equipment cannot keep up with the needs of delinting, and the installation force of delinting equipment is insufficient, which is also a very important issue at present, which is directly related to whether this year's delinting task can be successfully completed. At present, the relevant industrial departments have given strong support to the delinting work, and the production tasks of delinting machines can generally be completed on schedule. However, the production tasks of some auxiliary equipment and power equipment may not be completed as scheduled. This will affect the progress of the entire delinting work. The relevant departments should earnestly help the production units overcome some major difficulties, allocate the necessary raw materials, and fully tap the production potential, and strive to deliver the various delinting equipment they have contracted to the delinting departments on schedule or ahead of schedule. At the same time, Party committees and governments at all levels can transfer a group of technical personnel from other departments to support the supply and marketing cooperatives, so that the supply and marketing cooperatives can quickly install the existing delinting machines and put them into production as soon as possible.
    Short-fiber cotton, like ordinary cotton, is a state-unified purchase material. At present, many departments, such as commercial, foreign trade, industrial, and handicraft departments, go to the primary markets in cotton-producing areas to purchase cottonseed lint, which has caused some confusion. Some oil pressing factories also arbitrarily dispose of the cottonseed lint removed by themselves. These phenomena must be stopped immediately. In the future, all cottonseed lint will be uniformly purchased by the supply and marketing cooperatives entrusted by the state, and the domestic sales, export sales, and the needs of various departments will be uniformly distributed after consultation by the relevant central departments.
    At present, it is the season for large-scale cotton purchase and processing. All relevant regions and departments must earnestly check and solve the above-mentioned problems, and firmly grasp the opportunity, overcome all difficulties, and achieve simultaneous purchase, ginning, and delinting. As long as conditions permit, the delinting production time can also be considered to be changed from the current two-shift system to a three-shift system to fully utilize the existing equipment. In short, we must mobilize the masses and rely on the masses, give full play to all potential forces, and strive to complete this year's cottonseed delinting task.

    克服一切困难，坚决完成剥取棉籽短绒的任务
    本报评论员
    国务院在8月中旬发出了关于发展短绒棉生产的指示以后，各级党委和政府都很重视，积极督促供销合作社筹建各项剥绒设备和采取各种措施增加籽棉的收购量，动员和组织各方面的力量来做这个工作。但是，在前一段工作中也出现了不少问题，需要立即解决。
    据各地反映，在这个工作中比较普遍存在的问题是：剥绒技术赶不上工作的需要，各种必需的技术人员相当缺乏，以至不少地方轧下的棉籽不能及时剥绒，或者剥取的短绒率很低。这个问题值得引起足够的重视。各地应该立即有计划地大力组织和培养技术力量，切实加强对剥绒工作的技术指导。现在不少地区已经抽调一部分人员用速成的办法对他们传授剥绒技术，或者采取师傅带徒弟的方法和召开技术交流会的方法培养技术人员，从而有效地解决了技术力量不足的问题。这些方法各地应该继续推广。目前，在这方面还有两个问题需要很好地加以解决。一个问题是：某些地方还缺乏掌握较为复杂技术的人员，而这些人员用短期训练的方法又难以一下培养出来。这就需要各地党委和政府立即从其他部门调配一批必要的技术人员来支援短绒棉的生产。另一个问题是：对于有条件剥取短绒棉的农业社和农民，剥绒的技术指导工作还没有及时跟上去，这个工作也应该认真地进行。为了解决剥绒技术力量的不足，各地还可以抽调一批机动的技术人员，到棉花加工厂、榨油厂和农村中去，巡回指导。
    解决棉籽剥绒同皮棉供应之间和棉籽剥绒同棉籽榨油之间的矛盾，也是当前做好剥绒工作的一个重要问题。往年，采购部门收购籽棉以后，即送到轧花厂加工，将加工出来的皮棉立刻调运给纺织工厂，同时将棉籽调运给油厂榨油。今年，情况有了变化，棉籽在榨油之前要首先剥取棉籽上的短绒。我国目前剥绒机的设备远不能满足剥绒任务的要求，为了在棉籽榨油之前采取多剥短绒，有的地区就要抽出一部分轧花机进行剥绒；于是就影响到皮棉的加工和供应。同时，由于剥绒设备少，不能将轧花后的棉籽迅速地全部进行剥绒，因此又影响到棉籽榨油。应该本着互相照顾的精神来解决这两个矛盾：（一）在不影响皮棉调拨供应的条件下，积极地抽出一部分轧花机进行剥绒。也就是说，应该首先挑选剥绒条件好的、生产率高的地方，抽出一部分轧花机参加剥绒生产，让其它地方充分满足皮棉供应。（二）对于棉籽，仍应贯彻执行先剥绒后榨油的原则，在油料品种多的地区应该首先安排其他油料在年前榨油；榨油厂还应该尽先吸收分散在群众手中的棉籽进行剥绒，力求将国家所掌握的棉籽放在后面加工，以便多剥短绒。有的地方如果因为剥绒而严重影响榨油厂的生产，应该根据需要先拨一部分未剥绒的棉籽给榨油厂榨油；但是，各地应该对棉籽榨油的工作统筹安排，先将剥绒条件差、任务少的地区的多余棉籽调去榨油。
    现在，有的地区打算将剥绒机安装到城市的榨油厂中，同榨油厂相结合，以便利用榨油厂的动力和设备，并且节省国家的投资。这个办法需要考虑。因为单纯从剥绒设备的投资来计算，当然是附设在榨油厂比较好。但是，如果把农村棉籽运到城市，再把油饼和一部分油运回农村，中间所增加的费用就要超过设备上的节约，算起总账来国家就要受损失，而且这样做还不利于农业生产。因此，轧花厂、剥绒厂、榨油厂为了便于结合，应该以设置在农村为主。当然，对于城市现有的榨油厂，在原料供应上仍要给予适当的照顾。
    某些地方，农民出售籽棉同出售皮棉也存在着矛盾。国家能够大量掌握棉籽，对于完成剥绒任务是很重要的。目前已经有不少地区的农民积极响应国家的号召，踊跃地把籽棉卖给国家，使国家掌握了不少棉籽。但是，还有一些地区，如山西、陕西、四川等地的农民，把籽棉卖给国家的不多。这些地区的农民，一向是自行加工皮棉出卖给国家的。要求这些地区的农民多卖籽棉给国家，就关系到他们的习惯和利益问题；同时，这些地方的采购部门也缺少必要的轧花设备，籽棉收购过多反会影响皮棉的供应。因此，各地应该根据不同的情况，采取不同的措施，能多收购一些籽棉，当然很好，否则，也可以积极地设法使农民手中的棉籽能够把短绒剥取下来。
    动力设备和附属设备的生产赶不上剥绒需要，以及剥绒设备安装力量不足，也是当前一个十分重要的问题，它直接关系到今年剥绒任务能不能顺利完成。目前，有关工业部门对于剥绒工作已经给予大力的支持，剥绒机的生产任务一般都能按期完成。但是，对于一部分附属设备和动力设备的生产任务，可能不能如期完成。这就会影响到整个剥绒工作的进行。有关部门应该认真帮助生产单位克服某些重大的困难，调给必需的原料，并充分挖掘生产潜力，争取按期或者提前把承制的各项剥绒设备交给剥绒部门。同时，各级党委和政府可以从其他部门抽调一批技术人员支援供销合作社，以便供销合作社迅速地把已有的剥绒机安装起来，及早投入生产。
    短绒棉同普通棉花一样，是国家统购物资。目前有很多部门，如商业、外贸、工业、手工业等部门，到棉产区的初级市场收购棉籽短绒，引起了某些混乱。也有一些榨油厂把剥取下来的棉籽短绒随便自行处理。这些现象，必须立即加以制止。今后全部棉籽短绒棉都由国家委托的供销合作社统一收购，内销、外销以及各部门的需要，都要由中央有关部门协商后统一分配。
    目前正是棉花大量收购和加工的季节，各有关地区和部门必须认真地检查和解决上述一些问题，并紧紧地把握时机，克服一切困难，做到边收购、边轧花、边剥绒。只要条件许可，剥绒的生产时间也可以考虑由现在的两班制改为三班制，把现有的设备充分利用起来。总之，必须发动群众和依靠群众，发挥一切潜在力量，为完成今年的棉籽剥绒任务而奋斗。
