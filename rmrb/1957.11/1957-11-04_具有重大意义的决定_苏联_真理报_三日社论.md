    A Decision of Great Significance
    -- "Pravda" Editorial of Three Days Ago

      Today, "Pravda" published the press communique of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union held at the end of October 1957, and the resolution of the plenary session "On Improving Party and Political Work in the Soviet Army and Navy." Present at the Central Committee plenary session to discuss this important issue were marshals of the Soviet Union, commanders of military districts and naval fleets, members of military councils, and responsible personnel from the Soviet Ministry of Defense.

    The armed forces of the Soviet state, created and educated by the Communist Party, have traversed a glorious and heroic path, firmly defending the achievements of the Great October Socialist Revolution. During the period of the domestic war and foreign armed intervention, the newly established Red Army, under the leadership and inspiration of the Communist Party and its brilliant leader Lenin, demonstrated extraordinary heroism and boundless loyalty to the cause of socialism, thoroughly crushing the White Guard and interventionist bandits and driving them from Soviet soil. In the Great Patriotic War, the Soviet armed forces did not betray the love and trust of their people, defeated a powerful and vicious enemy, and gloriously fulfilled their duty to their homeland. The victory of world historical significance won by the Soviet people and their heroic armed forces in the anti-fascist war will forever remain in the memory of mankind.

    In the post-war years, thanks to the continuous care of the Communist Party and the Soviet people, and on the basis of the general upsurge of the national economy and the significant achievements in the development of heavy industry, science and technology, the Soviet armed forces have reached a new and higher level in their development. It is now equipped with a wide variety of modern equipment, including atomic weapons, thermonuclear weapons, and rocket technology. The command and political cadres and the entire army in the Soviet Army and Navy are infinitely loyal to the Soviet people, the Communist Party, and the cause of communism. The heroic Soviet armed forces resolutely and bravely defend the security of our motherland. The powerful Soviet armed forces, born in the flames of the Great October Revolution and educated by the Communist Party, are one of the most loyal and reliable guarantees for defending world peace.

    The Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the CPSU emphasized that the complexity of the current international situation and the frenzied arms expansion of the imperialist countries require all Soviet people to unremittingly struggle to fulfill the tasks of the 20th Congress of the CPSU: to maintain our national defense at the level of modern science and technology, and to ensure the security of our motherland. Defending the interests of the motherland requires commanders and political workers, political organs, and Party organizations in the Army and Navy to continuously improve the combat and political readiness of all units, ships, and corps of the Soviet Army, to strengthen military discipline, and to educate troops in the spirit of loyalty to the motherland, in the spirit of friendship among all nationalities of the Soviet Union and proletarian internationalism. The moral strength of our army is a great force, and this force must be achieved through tireless educational work. In the years of severe war tests, the soldiers, commanders, and political workers of the Army and Navy, cultivated by the Communist Party with lofty communist ideals and with love and loyalty to the Soviet motherland, have repeatedly shocked the world with their immortal feats and indomitable bravery. Our generation and our descendants will all have to learn from the examples of the glorious heroic sons and daughters of our people: Alexander Matrosov and Nikolai Gastello, Zoya Kosmodemyanskaya and Marite Melnikaite, Oleg Koshevoy and Musa Jalil.

    The Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the CPSU pointed out that further improvement of Party and political work in the Soviet Army and Navy, and the improvement of all educational activities to cultivate conscious and ideologically tempered soldiers, are of particular importance for solving these tasks. The meetings of Party activists held in many military districts and naval fleets before the opening of the plenary session, attended by tens of thousands of Party members, helped expose the enormous shortcomings in Party and political work.

    The Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the CPSU resolutely condemned the underestimation of Party and political work in the armed forces, and, in the spirit of the historic resolutions of the 20th Congress of the CPSU and the unshakeable Leninist traditions, formulated a detailed plan to fundamentally improve the work. Lenin taught us that where the most concern is shown for political work in the army, there is no slackening in the army, there the order and morale of the army are better, and there are more victories.

    Strengthening political work in the Army and Navy is the common task of all communists, commanders, and political workers. Their duty is to resolutely implement the Communist Party's policies in the armed forces and to become guides of the great Marxist-Leninist thought. They have a common purpose: that everyone serves the people in their own posts, and that they work together with one heart and one mind to unremittingly strengthen the armed forces of the Soviet state.

    The Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the CPSU exposed the serious mistakes and distortions made by Comrade Zhukov, the former Soviet Minister of Defense, in his work. As the resolution of the Central Committee plenary session said, Comrade Zhukov undermined Lenin's principle of Party leadership over the armed forces, and the line he pursued was to shrink the work of Party organizations, political organs, and military councils, and to abolish the leadership and supervision of the Party, the Central Committee, and the Soviet government over the Army and Navy. Comrade Zhukov attempted to cultivate a cult of personality around himself in the Soviet army. With his consent and endorsement, various sycophants began to praise him personally and excessively exaggerate his role in the Great Patriotic War in speeches, reports, articles, pamphlets, and films. In this way, in order to please Comrade Zhukov, history was distorted, the truth was misrepresented, the enormous efforts of the Soviet people, the heroism of our entire armed forces, the role of commanders and political workers, the military art of front-line and Army and Navy commanders, and the leading and inspiring role of the Communist Party were belittled. The numerous facts revealed at the Party activist meetings in various military districts showed that the former Minister of Defense adopted excessive administrative orders, insulted subordinates, did not understand the role of educational work in the army of a socialist country, and did not understand that the discipline and high morale of our army were based on the consciousness of the soldiers and officers of our army.

    Among those who spoke at the Central Committee plenary session were outstanding military figures, Marshals of the Soviet Union Malinovsky, Konev, Rokossovsky, Sokolovsky, Yeryomenko, Timoshenko, Biryuzov, Admiral Gorshkov, and Generals of the Army Batov, Zakharov, Kazakov, and others. Many of them had worked with Comrade Zhukov for decades. They pointed out Zhukov's serious shortcomings, sharply criticized his mistakes and distortions, and unanimously condemned his incorrect and non-Party behavior during his tenure as Soviet Minister of Defense.

    The Communist Party and the Soviet government attached great importance to Comrade Zhukov's military achievements, gave him great trust, awarded him the title of Marshal of the Soviet Union, awarded him the title of Hero of the Soviet Union four times, and awarded him many medals. At the 20th Congress of the Party, he was elected a member of the Central Committee of the CPSU, and at the Central Committee plenary session, he was elected an alternate member of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the CPSU, and later became a member of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the CPSU. However, due to insufficient Party spirit and insufficient political maturity, he lost the modesty of a Party member, presuming that he was the sole hero of all the victories achieved by our people and our armed forces under the leadership of the Communist Party.

    Comrade Zhukov's behavior during his tenure as Soviet Minister of Defense and member of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the CPSU was not in line with the Party's line. He betrayed the Party's trust in him, he became a politically unstable person, and he tended toward adventurism both in understanding the tasks of Soviet foreign policy and in the leadership of the Ministry of Defense.

    As everyone knows, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union removed Comrade Zhukov from the post of Soviet Minister of Defense. The Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the CPSU decided to remove him from the post of member of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the CPSU and member of the Central Committee of the CPSU.

    Speaking at the plenary session of the Central Committee of the CPSU, Comrade Zhukov admitted that the criticism of his mistakes was correct, and said:

      "This plenary session is a profound lesson in Party education for me. At the plenary session, everyone talked about the mistakes I made in leading the armed forces, especially the mistakes I made recently, and the political mistakes I made as a member of the Central Committee and a member of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the CPSU. I only truly realized the significance of these mistakes here, which I deeply regret.

      "I believe that the criticism of me here, at the plenary session, is basically correct, and I believe that this criticism is a Party-based, comradely help to me personally and to other military personnel, helping us to correctly understand the Party's requirements and line in the correct leadership of the Army and Navy, and in the correct Party and political education of the armed forces personnel.

      "Some comrades said when proposing disciplinary measures that I was once removed from the post of member of the Central Committee in 1946 when Stalin was alive, and said that I did not recognize the necessity of correcting those mistakes that caused the removal at that time. Comrades, at that time I could not admit, nor did I admit, that the removal of my membership in the Central Committee was correct, nor did I admit that the accusations made against me at that time were correct. Now it is another matter. Now, I admit my mistakes, and in the course of the plenary session, I have deeply realized these mistakes, and now I assure the Central Committee that I am determined to thoroughly correct my existing shortcomings."

    All the members of the Central Committee present at the meeting unanimously adopted the resolution of the plenary session of the Party Central Committee. This resolution was supported by all the alternate members of the Central Committee, members of the Central Auditing Commission, and military personnel present at the plenary session.

    At present, meetings of Party activists and general meetings of grassroots Party organizations are being held everywhere, at which the resolutions of the October Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the CPSU are discussed. The materials published by "Pravda" today on the meetings of Party activists held in Moscow, Leningrad, Kiev, and various military districts prove that the Communist Party members unanimously support the resolutions of the Central Committee plenary session and are determined to improve the level of Party and political work in the Soviet Army and Navy. The unanimous support for the resolution of the Central Committee plenary session of the CPSU reflects the unshakeable unity of the Communist Party and its Leninist Central Committee.

    The Soviet army is an army composed of conscious defenders of the great cause of the working people – the cause of socialism. It has an inseparable link with its people and with our glorious Communist Party. The Communist Party and the Soviet people love the Army and Navy of their motherland because they are loyal to the socialist motherland; the Communist Party and the Soviet people will spare no effort to further strengthen the Army and Navy.

    The Soviet people solemnly and excitedly welcome the national holiday of the 40th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution. Looking back on the victorious path our country has traveled, the people of all nationalities of the Soviet Union look with great gratitude to the Communist Party – the wise leader, organizer, and inspirer of all victories achieved in the struggle for communism.

    The Communist Party and the Soviet people are implementing the historic resolutions of the 20th Congress, and will continue to do everything in their power to strive for the new prosperity of our socialist motherland, for the building of a communist society, and for the further strengthening of the national defense forces of the Soviet socialist motherland.

    具有重大意义的决定
    ——苏联“真理报”三日社论
      “真理报”今天登载了苏联共产党中央委员会在1957年10月底举行的全体会议的新闻公报和全体会议“关于改进苏联陆海军中党和政治工作”的决议。出席中央全会讨论这一重大问题的有：苏联元帅、各军区和海军司令员、军事委员会委员和苏联国防部负责人员。
    由共产党所创建和教育的苏维埃国家武装部队经历了光荣、英勇的道路，牢固地保卫了伟大十月社会主义革命的成果。在国内战争时期和外国武装干涉时期，当时刚刚建立的、在共产党及其天才领袖列宁的领导和鼓舞下的红军，表现了出奇的英雄主义和对社会主义事业的无限忠诚，彻底粉碎了白卫军和干涉者匪帮，把他们从苏联土地上清除干净。在伟大卫国战争中，苏联武装部队没有辜负本国人民对它的爱戴和信任，战胜了强大的凶狠的敌人，光荣地履行了自己对祖国的职责。苏联人民及其英勇的武装部队在反法西斯战争中具有世界历史意义的胜利永远留在人类的记忆中。
    在战后年代里，由于共产党和苏联人民的不断关怀，在国民经济普遍高涨、重工业、科学和技术发展取得重大成就的基础上，苏联的武装部队在它的发展中达到了新的更高的水平。它现在配备着各种各样的现代化装备，其中包括原子武器、热核武器和火箭技术设备。苏联陆海军中的指挥干部和政治干部和全军都无限忠诚于苏联人民、共产党和共产主义事业。英勇的苏联武装力量坚毅果敢地保卫着我们祖国的安全。在伟大的十月革命战火中诞生的、共产党所教育出来的强大的苏联武装部队是保卫世界和平的最忠实和最可靠的保证之一。
    苏共中央全会强调指出，现代国际局势的复杂性和帝国主义国家的疯狂的军备扩张要求全体苏联人民坚持不懈地为完成苏共第二十次代表大会的任务而奋斗：把我们的国防保持在现代科学和技术的水平上，保障我们祖国的安全。保卫祖国的利益要求陆海军中的指挥员和政治工作人员、政治机构和党组织、军事委员会不断地提高苏联全军各部队、舰艇和兵团的战斗和政治准备，加强军纪，用忠于祖国的精神，用苏联各民族友好和无产阶级国际主义的精神教育部队。我国军队的道德力量是伟大的力量，这种力量的取得要通过不倦的教育工作。在严重的战争考验的年代里，共产党用崇高的共产主义理想、用热爱和忠于苏维埃祖国的精神培养出来的陆海军战士、指挥员和政治工作者，不止一次地以不朽的功勋和顽强果敢的精神震惊了世界。我们这一代人和我们的后代都将要学习我国人民的光荣的英雄儿女：亚历山大·马特洛索夫和尼柯莱·加斯捷洛、卓娅·柯斯莫捷米扬斯卡娅和马里泰·麦利尼卡伊捷、奥列格·柯歇伏依和穆萨·贾立里等人的榜样。
    苏共中央全会指出，进一步改善在苏联陆海军中党和政治工作，改善培养自觉的、经过思想锻炼的军人的一切教育活动，对解决这些任务具有特别重要的意义。全会开幕前在许多军区和海军中召开的、有数万名党员参加的党的积极分子会议帮助揭发了党和政治工作中的巨大缺点。
    苏共中央全会坚决地谴责了对武装部队中党和政治工作的估计不足，并且本着苏共第二十次代表大会的具有历史意义的决议和不可动摇的列宁传统精神，制定了一项从根本上改进工作的详尽的计划。列宁教导我们说：在军队中最关心进行政治工作的地方，那里在军队中就没有废弛现象，那里军队的秩序和士气就要好些，那里胜利也就多些。
    加强陆海军中政治工作是全体共产党员、指挥员和政治工作者的共同任务。他们的职责是：在武装部队中坚决贯彻共产党的政策、成为伟大的马克思列宁主义思想的向导。他们有一个共同的目的：每个人都在自己的岗位上为人民服务，今后同心同德、不懈地加强苏维埃国家的武装力量。
    苏共中央全会揭发了前苏联国防部长朱可夫同志在工作中的严重错误和歪曲事实的做法。正如中央全会决议中所说的，朱可夫同志破坏了列宁关于领导武装部队的党的原则，他所执行的路线是收缩党组织、政治机构和军事委员会的工作，取消党、党中央和苏联政府对陆海军的领导和监督。朱可夫同志力图在苏联军队中培植对他个人的崇拜。在他的同意和赞同下，各种阿谀逢迎的人在演讲、报告、文章、小册子和影片中开始赞扬他个人和过分地夸大他在伟大卫国战争中的作用。这样，为了讨好朱可夫同志，历史被歪曲，事实真象被曲解，苏联人民的巨大努力、我国全体武装部队的英雄主义、指挥员和政治工作者的作用、前线和陆海军指挥员的军事艺术、共产党的领导作用和鼓舞作用被贬低了。在各军区党积极分子会议上所揭发的许许多多事实表明，前国防部长采取了过分的行政命令手段，侮辱下级，不懂得社会主义国家军队中教育工作的作用，不懂得我们军队的纪律和高度士气是以我们军队的士兵和军官的觉悟性为基础的。
    在中央委员会全体会议上发言的有出色的军事活动家、苏联元帅马利诺夫斯基、科?夫、罗科索夫斯基、索科洛夫斯基、叶廖缅科、铁木辛哥、比留佐夫、海军上将戈尔什科夫、陆军大将巴托夫、扎哈罗夫、卡扎科夫等同志。他们中间有许多人曾经同朱可夫同志共事数十年。他们指出朱可夫的严重缺点，尖锐地批评他的错误和歪曲事实的做法，一致谴责他在担任苏联国防部长期间的不正确的非党的行为。
    共产党和苏联政府非常重视朱可夫同志的军事功绩，给予他重大的信任，授予他苏联元帅的称号，四次授予他苏联英雄的称号，奖给他许多勋章。在党的第二十次代表大会上他当选为苏共中央委员，在中央全会上他当选为苏共中央委员会主席团候补委员，随后又成为苏共中央主席团委员。但是，由于党性不够和在政治上不够成熟，他丧失了党员的谦虚，妄自以为他是我国人民和我国武装部队在共产党领导下所取得的一切胜利的唯一的英雄。
    朱可夫同志在担任苏联国防部长和苏共中央主席团委员期间的行为不符合党的路线。他辜负了党对他的信任，他成了在政治上站不稳的人，无论在理解苏联外交政策任务方面以及在国防部的领导方面都倾向于冒险主义。
    大家知道，苏联最高苏维埃主席团撤除了朱可夫同志苏联国防部长的职务。苏共中央全体会议决定撤除他的苏共中央主席团委员的职务和苏共中央委员的职务。
    朱可夫同志在苏共中央全会上发言时承认对他的错误的批评是正确的，他说：
      “这次全会对我来说是一堂深刻的党内教育。在全会上大家谈到了我在领导武装部队方面所犯的错误、特别是最近时期所犯的错误以及我作为中央委员、苏共中央主席团委员所犯的政治错误，这些错误的意义我只是在这里才真正认识到，这是我深感遗憾的。
      “我认为，在这里、在全会上对我的批评基本上是正确的，我认为这次批评是对我个人和其他军事工作人员的党内的、同志式的帮助，帮助我们正确地理解党在正确领导陆海军问题上、在对武装部队人员进行正确的党和政治教育问题上的要求和路线。
      “有些同志在提出处分办法时说，在1946年斯大林在世时我曾经一度被撤除中央委员的职务，并且说我没有认识到纠正当时造成撤职原因的那些错误的必要性。同志们，当时我不能承认、也没有承认撤除我的中央委员会委员的职务是正确的，也没有承认当时对我提出的指责是正确的。现在是另一回事了。现在，我承认自己的错误，在全体会议过程中，我深刻地认识了这些错误，现在我向中央委员会保证，决心彻底纠正我现有的缺点。”
    出席会议的全体中央委员一致通过了党中央全会的决议。这个决议得到了出席全会的全体候补中央委员、中央检查委员会委员以及军事工作人员的拥护。
    目前，各地都在举行党组织的积极分子会议以及基层党组织的全体大会，在这些会上讨论苏共中央十月全会的决议。今天，“真理报”所登载的关于在莫斯科、列宁格勒、基辅、各军区所举行的党的积极分子会议的材料证明，共产党员都一致拥护中央全会的决议，并决心提高苏联陆海军中党和政治工作的水平。对苏共中央全会决议的一致拥护反映了共产党及其列宁主义的中央委员会的不可动摇的团结一致。
    苏联军队是伟大的劳动人民事业——社会主义事业——自觉的捍卫者组成的军队。它同自己的人民、同我们光荣的共产党有着不可分割的联系。共产党和苏联人民热爱自己祖国的陆海军，因为他们忠于社会主义祖国；共产党和苏联人民不惜一切力量来更进一步加强陆海军。
    苏联人都隆重地和兴奋地迎接伟大的十月社会主义革命四十周年这个全民的节日。在回顾我国所走过的胜利道路的时候，苏联各族人民怀着十分感激的心情注视共产党——在争取共产主义的斗争中所取得的一切胜利的英明领袖、组织者和鼓舞者。
    共产党和苏联人民正在执行第二十次代表大会的有历史意义的决议，并且将继续尽自己的全部力量为争取我们社会主义祖国新的繁荣、争取建成共产主义社会、争取进一步加强苏维埃社会主义祖国的国防力量而奋斗。
