    Commemorating the Fiftieth Anniversary of the Spoken Drama Movement
    Drama Publishing House to Publish Related Books

    To commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the Chinese spoken drama movement, the China Drama Publishing House published Mr. Xu Banmei's "Reminiscences of the Founding Period of Spoken Drama" as early as July this year. Using his personal participation as the main thread, the book uses the style of memoirs to record the process from the beginning of spoken drama to the formation of spoken drama as a formal genre. It is also planned to publish Zhang Geng's "Chronicle of Major Events in the Spoken Drama Movement" and Zhao Mingyi's "Historical Records of Chinese Spoken Drama" within this year. "Chronicle of Major Events in the Spoken Drama Movement" is a historical reference book. This book uses a chronological format, from 1898 to 1937, listing major events in the Chinese spoken drama movement by year and month, including theater performances, dramatists' activities, the emergence of important plays and their contemporary evaluations, comprehensively and in detail narrating the development of the Chinese spoken drama movement. "Historical Records of Chinese Spoken Drama" discusses the combat experience of the Chinese spoken drama movement from 1906 to 1936, and is the first relatively complete and systematic history of drama theory to appear in recent years.

    In order to review the historical path of spoken drama art, summarize the past, and develop the future, and to provide materials for the research work of the spoken drama movement, the Chinese Dramatists Association has decided to compile the "Fifty Years of Historical Materials of the Chinese Spoken Drama Movement." The first collection, which will be published in January 1958, contains Tian Han's article on the historical development of the spoken drama movement, Ouyang Yuqian's two affectionate and moving memoirs of early spoken drama activities, "Recollections of Spring Willow" and "Talking about Civilization Drama," Hong Shen's "Fragments of the Drama Cooperative," the earliest actress Tang Shuming's prose recalling the South China Society, and reminiscences of the spoken drama movement during the League of Left-Wing Dramatists period written by Xia Yan, Zheng Boqi, Xu Xingzhi, and Shu Xiuwen, among others. There are also memories of the Soviet area drama movement by Li Bozhao, Zhao Pinsan, and Shi Lianxing, and memoirs and reports by workers engaged in the spoken drama movement in the enemy-occupied areas and the Kuomintang-controlled areas during the Anti-Japanese War, all of which are extremely valuable articles.

    In terms of spoken drama scripts, the publishing house has also successively published excellent plays since the May Fourth Movement: "Under the Eaves of Shanghai," "Thunderstorm," "Qu Yuan," "A Career Official," "Fog Chongqing," "Night Shanghai," "The Peach Blossom Fan," "The Death of a Famous Actor," "Sunrise," "Bi Xue Hua," "Tiger Tally," and more than ten others. The first and second volumes of "Hong Shen's Anthology," a collection of important plays from the life of Mr. Hong Shen, one of the founders of Chinese spoken drama and a famous dramatist, will also be published soon.

    纪念话剧运动五十周年
    戏剧出版社将出版有关书籍
    为了纪念中国话剧运动五十周年，中国戏剧出版社早在今年7月份，就出版了徐半梅先生以亲身参加的活动为主要线索，用回忆录的笔法，记述了开始有话剧到话剧形成正式剧种的经过的“话剧创始期回忆录”。今年年内还计划出版张庚著“话剧运动大事编年”和赵铭彝著“中国话剧史记”两本书。“话剧运动大事编年”，是一本史料书。这本书用编年形式，从1898年起到1937年止，按年月先后载列了中国话剧运动中的大事，包括剧团演出、戏剧家的活动、重要剧作的出现与当时的评价等，概括而又详尽地叙述了中国话剧运动的发展面貌。“中国话剧史记”论述了1906年到1936年这三十年间中国话剧运动的战斗经历，是近年来第一次出现的比较完整和系统的戏剧史论著。
    为了回顾话剧艺术的历史道路，总结过去，开拓将来，为话剧运动的研究工作提供资料，中国戏剧家协会决定编辑“中国话剧运动五十年史料集”。将于1958年1月出版的第一辑，载有田汉论述话剧运动历史发展的文章，欧阳予倩的“回忆春柳”和“谈文明戏”两篇亲切动人的早期话剧活动的回忆录，洪深的“戏剧协社片断”，最早的女演员唐叔明回忆南国社的散文，夏衍、郑伯奇、许幸之、舒绣文等写的剧联时期话剧运动的回忆录，李伯钊、赵品三、石联星对苏区戏剧运动的追记，抗战时期在敌后根据地和国统区从事话剧运动的工作者的回忆录和报道，都是极有价值的文章。
    话剧剧本方面，该社还陆续出版了“五四”以来优秀的剧作：“上海屋檐下”、“雷雨”、“屈原”、“升官图”、“雾重庆”、“夜上海”、“桃花扇”、“名优之死”、“日出”、“碧血花”、“虎符”等十余种。中国话剧奠基人之一、著名戏剧家洪深先生一生的重要剧作集“洪深文集”第一、二卷，也即将出版。　（志彬）
