The Tajik Republic, a close neighbor of Xinjiang in our country, is located on the Pamir Plateau, known as the "Roof of the World" in Central Asia, and is a beautiful mountainous country. Three-quarters of the republic's entire territory is plateau more than 4,000 meters above sea level. The Soviet Union's two highest peaks, the Lenin Peak and the Stalin Peak, both over 7,000 meters high, are located here.

Nature has given the Tajik Republic so many mountains, and at the same time, it has given it abundant mineral resources, such as gold, arsenic, tin, lead, and oil. The Fergana Valley in the north and the west produce cotton, and the yield per unit area of cotton in Tajikistan ranks first in the Soviet Union, and the absolute output ranks second in the entire Soviet Union. Last year, it supplied the country with 417,000 tons of cotton. Not only that, but a quarter of Tajikistan's cotton is valuable long-staple cotton.

However, during the reign of the Tsars, Tajikistan was the most remote and backward region in Russia. The vast number of farmers cultivated with backward primitive tools. Industry was extremely backward, with a total of only two hundred industrial workers. The people lived in extreme poverty, and the children of the working people had no opportunity to go to school. Before the revolution, only one in every two hundred Tajiks could read. The total number of doctors in the country was less than twenty, and there were only forty hospital beds. All kinds of infectious diseases were rampant.

Now everything has completely changed! The Republic's industrial output this year will increase to 28 times that of 1913. Large factories famous throughout the country, such as the Stalinabad United Textile Factory and the Leninabad United Silk Factory, have been built, and the petroleum industry, coal industry, and power stations have also been constructed. In addition, many railways and highways have been built in Tajikistan, where high mountains block the way everywhere. Cars are now speeding in places where only camel caravans could pass in the past.

Education has also developed greatly, and the people's cultural level has been greatly improved. Tajikistan now has 2,500 primary schools, eight institutions of higher learning, and one academy of sciences. The ranks of Tajik intellectuals have grown greatly. There are now ninety-two higher education students per 10,000 residents, which is eight times that of Turkey and ten times that of Pakistan. There are 7,000 medical workers and the number of hospital beds has increased to 10,000. The 1.8 million people of the Tajik Republic live a cultured and happy life.

The Republic's capital, Stalinabad, is itself a testament to the Republic's rapid development in the Soviet era. In this place that used to be the small mountain village of Dushanbe, there are now beautiful high-rise buildings everywhere. It is the industrial and cultural center of the Republic.

    “世界屋脊”上的塔吉克共和国
    塔吉克共和国，是我国新疆的近邻，位于中亚细亚号称“世界屋脊”的帕米尔高原上，是个美丽的山国。这个共和国全部领土的四分之三都是拔海四千公尺以上的高原，苏联最高的两座高达七千多公尺的列宁峰和斯大林峰就在这里。
    大自然给了塔吉克共和国这么多的大山，同时也给了它丰富的矿物资源，像黄金、砷、锡、铅、石油等。北部费尔干谷地和西部都产棉花，而且塔吉克的棉花单位面积产量在苏联名列第一，绝对产量占全苏联的第二位。去年它供给了国家四十一万七千吨棉花。不仅如此，塔吉克棉花中有四分之一是贵重的长纤维棉花。
    但是在沙皇统治的年代里，塔吉克是俄国最偏僻落后的地区。广大的农民以落后的原始工具耕作。工业更是极为落后，产业工人总共才有二百多人。人民过着极贫苦的生活，劳动人民的子弟根本没有机会进学校念书。革命前每二百个塔吉克人中，只有一个认字的。全国医生数目还不到二十个，病床只有四十张。各种传染病非常猖獗。
    现在一切都完全改观了！共和国的工业产量今年将增加为1913年的二十八倍，已建起了像斯大林纳巴德的联合纺织厂、列宁纳巴德的联合丝织厂这样全国闻名的大工厂，石油工业、煤炭工业和发电站也都建设了起来。此外，在这处处有高山阻路的塔吉克已修建了许多铁路和公路，在过去只有骆驼队能通行的地方，现在已有汽车在飞奔了。
    教育事业也同样有了很大的发展，人民的文化程度大大提高了。塔吉克现在有二千五百所小学校，八所高等院校和一所科学院。塔吉克本民族的知识分子队伍大大成长起来了，现在每一万个居民中有九十二个高等学校学生，这个数字为土耳其的八倍，巴基斯坦的十倍。医务工作人员已有七千名，病床数增加到了一万张。塔吉克共和国的一百八十万人民，过着有文化的幸福的生活。
    共和国的首都斯大林纳巴德本身也是共和国在苏维埃时代飞跃发展的明证。在这个从前是小山村杜沙姆巴的地方，现在到处是美丽的高楼大厦。它是共和国的工业和文化中心。　（东来）（附图片）
