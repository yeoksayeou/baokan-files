    The first pair of coal mine shafts built in Hebi City, Henan Province, officially went into production on the 1st after half a month of trial production.

    This pair of mine shafts was designed by our country and construction began three years ago. It is highly mechanized and can produce 450,000 tons of raw coal annually after being put into production.

    Hebi Coal Mine has a history of more than 800 years of mining, but before liberation, there was no decent mine shaft. In the past three years, this place has undergone fundamental changes.

    鹤壁市第一对煤矿矿井建成
    年产原煤四十五万吨
    在河南省鹤壁市兴建的第一对煤矿矿井经过半个月的试生产，已在1日正式投入生产。
    这对矿井是由我国自己设计在三年前开工兴建的，机械化程度很高，投入生产后每年可以生产原煤四十五万吨。
    鹤壁煤矿虽有八百多年的开采历史，但是在解放前没有一座像样的矿井。近三年来这个地方发生了根本变化。
