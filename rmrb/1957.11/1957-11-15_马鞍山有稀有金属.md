    Ma'anshan Has Rare Metals
    A large rare metal deposit has recently been discovered in the Ma'anshan mining area.
    Since the beginning of the first Five-Year Plan, the 342 Exploration Team of the East China Geological Bureau of the Ministry of Geology has explored nearly 100 million tons of iron ore reserves and more than 10 million tons of pyrite (the main raw material for sulfuric acid) in the rich Ma'anshan mining area, and conducted a general survey of other larger pyrite and iron ore deposits. Recently, a large rare metal deposit and some rare earth dispersed elements have been discovered in this mining area. Taking the world's rare vanadium-titanium ore as an example, it is initially estimated that this mining area has tens of thousands of tons, and it grows together with iron ore, becoming a precious natural alloy raw material.

    马鞍山有稀有金属
    马鞍山矿区最近发现了很大的稀有金属矿床。
    地质部华东地质局三四二勘探队，自第一个五年计划开始以来，在富饶的马鞍山矿区，探明了铁矿储量近亿吨，黄铁矿（制硫酸的主要原料）储量千多万吨，并普查了其他一些更大的黄铁矿床及铁矿床。近来在这个矿区又发现了很大的稀有金属矿床及一些稀土分散元素。单就世界上稀有的钒钛矿来讲，据初步估计，这个矿区就达数万吨，并且跟铁矿生在一起，成为珍贵的天然合金原料。　（向缉熙）
