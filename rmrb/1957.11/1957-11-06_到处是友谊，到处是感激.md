    Everywhere is Friendship, Everywhere is Gratitude
    By Our Staff Reporter
    Great red palace lanterns are hung at Tiananmen Square, and giant statues of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin stand tall on the square. Lofty slogan towers are erected. Streets, shop windows, and courtyard walls are covered with slogans and colorful paintings. No festival is more grand, more enthusiastic, and more magnificent than this year's October Revolution Day.
    Celebration meetings are held everywhere, and Soviet photo exhibitions are displayed everywhere. Whether in factories, villages, schools, or in government offices, shops, or parks, the words of friendship and gratitude can be heard everywhere.
    The First Unit, the First Aircraft, the First Factory
    We went to the electron tube factory, where a grand meeting to celebrate the October Revolution Day was being held.
    We only saw a large crowd of people suddenly surround the experts. They were scrambling to shake hands with the experts. Hundreds and thousands of hands stretched out, hundreds and thousands of eyes looked at the experts.
    The workers presented the experts with a crimson velvet banner, with the golden glittering words: "Sincerely thank the Soviet people for their internationalist assistance." This is not a simple sentence, it represents the simple and pure feelings of hundreds of millions of Chinese people.
    I remember once, the director of the chemical workshop introduced the factory's machinery and equipment to us, pointing to the ultrasonic washing machine, he said: "You see, it says No. 1 on it, this is a new Soviet product. The Soviet Union gave us the very first machine, I heard they are still using the old machines themselves."
    We walked to the double-threaded automatic machine, he introduced: "This is a machine specially made for us by a tool factory in Leningrad, fully automated. Previously, such machines in the Soviet Union were semi-automatic."
    In the tungsten-molybdenum workshop, in the wire drawing die section, when we saw dozens of young girls drilling holes in diamonds as thin as one-seventh of a hair, we were simply fascinated by their nimble, working hands. People in the factory told us that just over a year ago, they were still students in ordinary schools. They only studied for half a year before they started working on the machine tools. We simply couldn't believe such words. We talked to Bao Congxin, a worker responsible for sealing and exhaust adjustment. Listen to what he said! He said: "With a Soviet teacher like that, what miracles can't be created?" He said that nearly two hundred Soviet experts had come to their factory one after another, and the workers were all taught by the experts hand in hand. He also talked about the nearly one hundred technicians and workers from the factory who went to the Soviet Union to study, and he told some of his personal experiences.
    Before he went to the Soviet Union, he was a third-grade worker. At that time, it could be said that he didn't understand anything. After arriving at the Saratov factory in the Soviet Union, he was assigned to learn skills from Master Alexey. Because his foundation was weak, coupled with nervousness, he often produced defective products. When defective products were produced, Alexey's salary would be reduced (they were paid by piece). This made him timid and afraid to turn on the machine tool. His thoughts were known by the master, Alexey said: "I teach you not for money, but for building socialism, for the cause of world peace. Who isn't inexperienced at first!" In this way, he gradually gained confidence. He learned the technology of sealing, exhausting, and adjusting, and he became a sixth-grade worker.
    Leaving the electron tube factory, we thought a lot on the road. We thought of our country's first aircraft, first locomotive, first automobile, and the magnificent Yangtze River Bridge... and also thought of the Soviet Union. If it weren't for the help of the Soviet Union, how could our country have been built so quickly? If it weren't for the guidance of Soviet experts, how could the technical level of our country's working class have improved so quickly!

    The Best Celebration Gift
    We went to the Sino-Soviet Friendship Agricultural Cooperative. The cooperative was preparing to celebrate the October Revolution Day. Eight large red lanterns had already been pasted up. Soviet photos were also displayed in ten large glass cabinets. The library was plastered with Soviet pictures. We wanted to talk to the actors of this cooperative, but they were all out, those catching the train were catching the train, those going to the fields were going to the fields, and they would only come back in the evening to rehearse the play.
    Ma Zhixiang, the head of Babao Mountain Township, said: "When it comes to celebrating the October Revolution Day, who isn't enthusiastic!" He talked about the story of how the cooperative got its name. He said that this cooperative was formed by merging five cooperatives from two townships. When it came to naming it, everyone argued, and everyone wanted to use the original name of their cooperative. But with five cooperative names, which one should be used? Everyone clamored for a long time, and no one would give way. Later, someone suggested calling it the Sino-Soviet Friendship Cooperative. At this moment, everyone was happy. That's how the name was decided.
    The township head continued to say that it had been quite lively these days in preparation for the celebration. But everyone said that the best celebration gift for the Soviet big brother was production. Everyone said that they would bring their enthusiasm and deep friendship for the Soviet people into production, seize the time for winter production, strive to plow the land once in winter, and also dig ditches to turn 1,280 mu of dry land into paddy fields. The total value of sideline production should reach 220,000 yuan. In addition, a campaign to accumulate 10,000 jin of fertilizer per mu would also be launched.

    Singing About Grandpa Lenin
    On the afternoon of November 3rd, Chinese and Soviet children held a get-together at the Beijing Hotel. In front of the radiant models of the Kremlin and Tiananmen, we heard the moving dedication of the Chinese children: "Forty years ago, Grandpa Lenin led the Soviet Communist Party and raised the revolutionary banner of liberating all mankind.... Today, the revolutionary red flag is flying everywhere, and our lives are so happy. We will never forget that whether in the years of war or during construction, the hand of Soviet people's friendship has never left us. In Wuhan, right where Captain Kulichenko sacrificed his life, today, Soviet experts are helping us build the Yangtze River Bridge. In the Northeast, right where the Soviet Red Army shed blood, today, Soviet experts are helping us build thousands of mines and factories.... We want to sing about Sino-Soviet friendship day and night, dear Soviet Young Pioneer comrades, we are also little grandchildren of Grandpa Lenin, for the great cause of communism, let us join hands and move forward together!" Then, hundreds of Chinese and Soviet children held hands and danced. Although none of them could understand each other's words, everyone understood each other's thoughts.

    "Painless Surgery"
    We went to Shangxiejie Elementary School in Beijing and came across Shen Zhongying, a pediatrician from the Sino-Soviet Friendship Hospital, who was telling stories to the elementary school students:
    Shen Zhongying said: One day, a twelve-year-old child came from Xi'an. His intestines had fallen out of his navel. In order to prevent the child from being nervous during the surgery, the expert played with the child and taught him to speak Russian. The expert asked: "Why didn't you have the surgery in Xi'an? Why did you have to come all the way to Beijing?" The child playfully said: "Because I heard that there is a Soviet Red Cross Hospital in Beijing. There is an expert named Vasker Yasinsky in the hospital, so I wanted to come." The expert heard the child say his name, and smiled and asked: "Have you learned the Russian I just taught you?" The child said: "Learned it, Do Svidaniya!" (meaning goodbye). The expert smiled and shook hands with the child and walked away. The child anxiously asked: "Why did the expert leave?" The nurse said: "Your surgery is over." The child asked strangely: "Why didn't I feel any pain?"
    The elementary school students listened with fascination, and they wanted to see the Soviet experts!

    An Endless Song
    Beijing is filled with fiery enthusiasm for Soviet friends everywhere.
    Going for a stroll on a festive night is truly wonderful. The tall buildings are like strings of pearls. People flock to the parks. The trees in Zhongshan Park are hung with red, blue, and yellow light bulbs. Thousands upon thousands of lotus lanterns float on the water in Beihai Park, and the Working People's Cultural Palace is also brilliantly lit. People sing and dance there, watch acrobatics, shadow plays, Peking opera....

    "Moscow-Beijing" seems like an endless song singing in people's hearts. Dear Soviet brothers! Let us embrace you from the bottom of our hearts! Let us congratulate you from the bottom of our hearts!

    到处是友谊，到处是感激
    本报记者
    天安门挂起了大红宫灯，广场上竖起了马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的巨像。高大的标语塔搭起来了。街道、橱窗、院墙贴满了标语、彩画。没有那个节日比今年十月革命节更隆重、更热烈、更盛大。
    到处在开庆祝会，到处有苏联的图片展览。无论在工厂、农村、学校，无论在机关、商店、公园，到处可以听到友谊和感谢的言语。
    第一台、第一架、第一座
    我们到电子管厂去，那里在开一个庆祝十月革命节的大会。
    我们只看见一大群人一下子就把专家们围住了。他们争着抢着和专家握手。成百成千只手伸过去，成百成千只眼睛看着专家。
    工人们送给专家一面紫红色丝绒锦旗，上面写着金闪闪几个字：“真诚地感谢苏联人民的国际主义的援助”。这不是一句简单的话，它代表着亿万中国人民的朴实、纯真的感情。
    记得有一次，化学车间的车间主任给我们介绍厂里的机器设备，他指着超音波洗涤机说：“你们瞧，这上面写着第一号，这是苏联的新产品。苏联把头一个机器送给我们，听说他们自己还在用旧机器。”
    我们走到双螺纹自动机面前，他介绍说：“这是列宁格勒一个工具厂专为我们作的机器，全部自动化。以前苏联的这种机器都是半自动化的”。
    在钨钼车间拉丝模工段，我们看到几十个年青的女孩子在金钢石上钻着等于一根头发的七分之一那么细的钻孔时，我们简直被她们灵巧的、劳动的手迷住了。厂里的人告诉我们，一年多前，他们还是普通学校里的学生。他们只学了半年就上机床了。我们简直不能相信这样的话。我们和封口、排气调整工人鲍从信谈起这件事。你听他怎么说！他说：“有了苏联这样的老师什么奇迹创造不出来？”他说他们厂陆陆续续来过一百九十七位苏联专家，工人都是专家手把着手教出来的。他又谈到这个厂近百个技术员和工人到苏联学习的情况，他讲了一些他亲身经历的事。
    他去苏联以前是个三级工。那时可以说是什么都不懂。到苏联沙拉托夫工厂后，被指派跟阿历克赛老师傅学手艺。自己底子不厚，加上心慌，老出废品。出废品，阿历克赛的工资就要少拿了。（他们是记件工资）。这样弄得他缩手缩脚，不敢开机床。他的心思叫师傅知道了，阿历克赛说：“我教你不是为了钱，是为了建设社会主义，是为了世界人民的和平事业。那一个人不是由不会到会的！”就这样他渐渐有信心了。他学会了封口、排气和调整的技术，他成了六级工。
    离开电子管厂，路上，我们想得很多很多。我们想到我国的第一架飞机、第一辆火车头、第一辆汽车，想到美丽如虹的长江大桥……同时也想到了苏联。要不是苏联的帮助，我们的国家那会建设得这样快？要不是苏联专家的教导，我国工人阶级的技术水平那会提高得这样快！
      最好的庆祝礼物
    我们去中苏友好农业合作社。社里正在准备庆祝十月革命节。八个红色的大灯笼已经糊起来了。十个大玻璃橱里的苏联图片也展出来了。图书室贴的满是苏联画片。我们很想找这个社的演员谈谈，可是他们都出去了，赶火车的赶火车，下地的下地，晚上才回来排戏。
    八宝山乡的乡长马致祥说：“提起庆祝十月革命节，谁的劲头不大呢！”他谈起这个社起名字的故事。他说，这个社是由二个乡里的五个社合并起来的。在起名字的时候，大伙争起来了，谁都想用自己社原来的名字。可是五个社名，该用那个好呢！大伙嚷嚷了好久，谁也不让谁。后来有人提议叫中苏友好社。这一下，大家才都高兴了。名字就这样定下来了。
    乡长接着又说，这几天为了准备庆祝，闹的挺热闹。可大伙说，给苏联老大哥最好的庆祝礼物还是生产。大伙说要把对苏联人民的热情和深厚的友谊带到生产中去，抓紧冬季生产，争取冬季普耕一遍，还要开渠，把一千二百八十亩旱地变成水田。副业生产总额要达到二十二万元。另外，还要展开每亩积肥一万斤的运动。
      歌唱列宁爷爷
    11月3日下午，中苏儿童在北京饭店联欢。在光芒四射的克里姆林宫和天安门的模型前面，我们听到中国少年动人的献词：“四十年前，列宁爷爷领导苏联共产党，举起了解放全人类的革命大旗……。如今，革命的红旗到处飘扬，我们的生活才有这样的幸福。我们永远不会忘记，无论是战争的年代，或是建设的时候，苏联人民友谊的手从没有离开过我们。在武汉，就在库里申科大队长牺牲的地方，今天，苏联专家帮助我们建造了长江大桥。在东北，就在苏联红军流过血的地方，今天，苏联专家又帮助我们建成了千百座矿山、工厂……。我们要为中苏友谊日日夜夜歌唱，亲爱的苏联少先队员同志们，我们也都是列宁爷爷的小孙孙，为伟大的共产主义事业，让我们共同携手前进！”接着，几百个中苏小朋友就手拉着手跳起舞来。他们虽然谁也听不懂谁的话，可是谁也明白谁的心思。
      “无痛手术”
    我们到北京市上斜街小学，碰上中苏友谊医院小儿科大夫沈钟英正在给小学生们讲故事：
    沈钟英说：有一天，从西安来了个十二岁的孩子。他的肠子从肚脐眼那里掉了出来。专家为了叫孩子动手术时不紧张，就和孩子玩，教孩子说俄语。专家问：“你为什么不在西安作手术？非要跑到北京来呢？”孩子顽皮地说：“因为我听说北京有个苏联红十字医院。医院里有一位瓦斯克业辛斯基专家，所以我愿意来。”专家听这个孩子说出了他的名字，就笑着问：“我刚教给你的俄语会了吗？”孩子说：“学会了，抖拉斯其！”（握手再见的意思）。专家笑着和孩子握了握手，走开了。孩子急得问：“专家为什么走了？”护士说：“你的手术已经完了。”孩子奇怪地问：“我怎么一点也没觉得痛呀？”
    小学生听得入了迷，他们多想见见苏联专家呀！
    永远唱不完的歌
    北京城，到处充满了对苏联朋友火一样的热情。
    节日的夜晚，出去蹓，那真是美极了。高楼上像镶了一串串的珍珠。人们涌向公园。中山公园的树上挂满了红色的、蓝色的、黄色的电灯泡。北海公园的水上飘起了千千万万盏荷灯，劳动人民文化宫也是灯火辉煌。人们在那里欢歌乐舞，看杂技、皮影、京戏……。
      “莫斯科—北京”好像一支永远唱不完的歌在人们心里唱着。亲爱的苏联兄弟！让我们从心底里和你们拥抱！让我们从心底里向你们祝贺！
