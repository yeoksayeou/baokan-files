Report:

    The Datun Township in the eastern suburbs of Beijing has a total of seventy middle and primary school graduates who did not continue their education this year. Among them, twenty participated in agricultural production, while the remaining fifty were mostly younger and eager to continue their studies. The heads of the Township People's Committee and Party organization, together with parents and school teachers, conducted research and decided to help them organize labor production self-study groups, entrusting the principal of the township's civil school with specific leadership.
    Based on the distribution of students' residences, a total of four groups were organized throughout the township, each with about ten people. High school graduates who did not continue their education were hired as tutoring teachers. In addition to the language and arithmetic of senior elementary school, the content of study also included abacus calculation for agricultural society accountants, as requested by parents. The study time is determined according to the agricultural production situation, with more study time during slack seasons and less during busy seasons. The expenses required by the study groups are borne by the students themselves—they participate in lighter labor and use the work points earned to cover study expenses and subsidize the tutoring teachers' fees. To help the tutoring teachers prepare lessons and solve other tutoring difficulties, several local primary school teachers were also invited to guide teaching operations.
    After the establishment of the labor self-study groups, they were very popular among parents and students, who believed that this approach could combine learning and production without increasing the family's financial burden.

    既能生产和学习，又不增加家庭经济负担
    京郊大屯乡劳动生产自学小组办得好
    本报讯　北京市东郊区大屯乡今年没有升学的中小学毕业生共七十人。其中有二十人参加了农业生产，其余五十人大多年龄较小，迫切要求继续学习。乡人民委员会、党组织的负责人同家长及学校教师进行了研究，决定帮助他们组织劳动生产自学小组，并委托乡民校校长进行具体领导。
    根据学生住地的分布情况，全乡共组织四个小组，每组十人左右，聘请没有升学的高初中毕业生担任辅导教师。学习的内容除去高小的语文、算术以外，根据家长的要求还请农业社会计补习珠算。学习的时间是根据农业生产的情况来规定，农闲时学习时间多些，农忙时学习时间就少些。学习小组所需经费都由学生自己负担——他们参加较轻便的劳动，用所得工分来解决学习费用和补助辅导教师的费用。为了帮助辅导教师备课和解决其他辅导上的困难，还约请当地几位小学教师指导教学业务。
    劳动自学小组建立起来以后，很受家长及学生的欢迎，他们认为这样做既能学习和生产，又不给家庭增加经济上的负担。
