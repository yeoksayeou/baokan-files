How Much National Bonds Are You Preparing to Subscribe to Next Year?

The "1958 National Economic Construction Bond Regulations" have been promulgated and will be implemented on January 1, next year. Issuing national bonds is a good way to accumulate national construction funds and increase personal savings. As the people of the great People's Republic of China, each of us should be diligent and thrifty, and build our motherland into a strong socialist country. Comrade Liu Shaoqi said in his speech at the Beijing celebration of the 40th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution: "The Chinese people should have ambition, should be invigorated, and adhere to the fine tradition of diligence and thrift, so as to build China into one of the richest and strongest countries in the world in the next few decades." This is a powerful call to all the people of our country. We should strive to increase national accumulation and also strive to implement personal savings. This is of positive significance for our country's socialist construction. The issuance of construction bonds is not only conducive to the accumulation of national construction funds, but also conducive to personal savings. This is a win-win situation.

The issuance of bonds also has a direct impact on social atmosphere, it will help us to establish a thrifty atmosphere. Now our social atmosphere is fundamentally different from the past. The bad habits and bad atmosphere left over from the old society have changed a lot, but they have not been completely changed. The economic life of the people of our country has generally and significantly improved in recent years, and some people do not pay attention to thrift. We see that there are many young male and female employees who do not have family economic burdens, and they have not felt any difficulties in their lives in recent years, and they do not know how to prepare for their future marriage, career, and raising children. Some young people even blindly pursue material enjoyment, spending money to the fullest. This situation is very bad. This style is extremely inconsistent with the requirements of the Chinese people to realize the current major historical tasks, and it is also very unfavorable for them to plan for their future days. They should be advised to save more money and strive to increase savings.

Of course, we also see that, due to the continuous improvement of the material life of the people of our country in recent years, the broad masses have been encouraged by the great achievements of socialist construction, and their socialist consciousness has risen to an unprecedented level. Now, more and more people are actively subscribing to national bonds as a way of personal savings. It can also be said that purchasing national bonds has become a conscious and indispensable thing in the economic life of the broad masses of the people in our country. According to statistics from the Ministry of Finance, by the end of September this year, the national bonds for 1957 subscribed to by the people of the country have reached 650 million yuan, over fulfilling the original issuance plan. The broad patriotic people have demanded that the state increase the amount of national bonds issued and continue to issue them during the Second Five-Year Plan period in order to build our motherland faster and better. This is reasonable. As the people's purchasing power further increases and the people's income from principal and interest on national bonds increases year by year, the amount of national bonds issued should of course be appropriately increased year by year.

The planned amount of national bonds to be issued in 1958 is slightly higher than in the past—it is planned to issue 630 million yuan, an increase of 30 million yuan over the planned issuance in 1957. Judging from the subscription of national bonds this year, as long as we strengthen publicity and education and improve sales work, the national bond sales plan for the next year can be completed and even overfulfilled. The state has also made reasonable adjustments to the distribution of national bonds for the next year based on the specific circumstances of each class. Although the distribution ratio of each class has increased or decreased compared with this year, the increase or decrease is not large. The adjusted ratio will be closer to the economic affordability of the people of each class and more conducive to the development of the entire national economy. This creates better conditions for the smooth completion and overfulfillment of the national bond sales task.

There are also some changes in the method of paying interest on national bonds for the next year. The new method stipulates that national bonds that are not drawn annually will no longer be paid interest separately, and all principal and interest will be paid in full at the time of the draw. (The method of paying interest on national bonds issued in the past few years remains unchanged.) This is because the number of national bond issues increases year by year, and the time for paying interest each year is stipulated from September 30 to the end of December; however, the actual payment time is mostly concentrated in the ten days or so after the opening of the payment. Therefore, in the early stage of redeeming national bond interest, there is often a phenomenon of congestion, which wastes the people's production time. At the same time, because most of the national bonds purchased by the masses are small in amount and the interest is limited, not paying interest every year will not affect their lives. Adopting the new method can reduce some of their troubles. By postponing the payment of interest, the state can also use this part of the interest for construction undertakings. It is not difficult to see that adopting the new method of paying interest is very convenient for those who subscribe to national bonds, and it is also of great benefit to the country. This method will definitely be supported by the masses.

Then, what problems are still facing us now? Yes. This is to ask: How much national bonds are you preparing to subscribe to next year? This is a question that everyone should consider. We hope that everyone will consider it now. Of course, to strive to buy more national bonds, we must first arrange our lives well. We must make a general plan for household and personal income and expenditure, and, without affecting the necessary living conditions, strive to subscribe to national bonds in the spirit of thrift, simplicity, and diligence in managing the household. We should neither be conservative nor rely solely on momentary enthusiasm. In the past, some people reported a large amount when subscribing to national bonds, but because their living expenses were not planned, the amount subscribed was not fully realized. This situation should be avoided.

The subscription of national bonds by people of all classes over the past few years has proved that the national bond sales work is always completed most smoothly among the broad masses of workers (including staff of state organs) in our country. They can complete more than 370 million yuan this year, greatly exceeding the predetermined target (280 million yuan). This fully demonstrates the high level of conscious spirit and master attitude of the working class in our country in the cause of socialist construction. We believe that the broad masses of workers will definitely be able to continue to carry forward this conscious spirit and master attitude in subscribing to national bonds for the next year, and strive for oversubscription. We also hope that people of other classes will learn from workers nationwide and strive to purchase more national bonds.

If calculated on the basis of households, the amount of national bonds subscribed to by farmers in our country is very small; however, because they are the most numerous, they are a force that cannot be ignored. According to past experience, whether the national bond task assigned to farmers can be completed depends on whether the sales work can be done well. In the past, the method of separate subscription and separate payment by each household of farmers was both troublesome and difficult to complete the task, and the masses also had opinions. In order to change this situation, the State Council has issued instructions this year, requiring agricultural cooperatives to organize subscriptions, distribute them to households, complete the subscription figures voluntarily after democratic discussion, and pay the money in a unified manner by the agricultural cooperative. The facts in many areas have proved that adopting this method can not only smoothly complete the task, but also make the masses feel satisfied.

The national bonds issued during the First Five-Year Plan have already played a considerable role in national construction. In 1958, when the Second Five-Year Plan is about to begin, let us subscribe more to the 1958 national bonds to make our country's economic construction develop more smoothly!

### 你准备明年认购多少公债？

    你准备明年认购多少公债？
    “1958年国家经济建设公债条例”已经公布，将于明年1月1日起施行。发行公债是积累国家建设资金和增加个人积蓄的一种良好方法。作为伟大的中华人民共和国的人民，我们每一个人都应该勤劳节俭，把我们的祖国建设成为强盛的社会主义国家。刘少奇同志在北京各界庆祝伟大十月社会主义革命四十周年大会上的讲话中说：“中国人民应当有志气，应当振作精神，坚持勤劳节俭的优良作风，以便在最近几十年内把中国建设成为世界上一个最富强的国家。”这是对于我国全体人民的一个有力的号召。我们应该努力增加国家积累，同时也努力实行个人积蓄。这对于我国社会主义建设是有积极意义的。建设公债的发行不但有利于国家建设资金的积累，而且也有利于个人的积蓄。这是两全其美的好事。
    公债的发行对于社会风气也有直接的影响，它有助于我们树立节俭的风气。现在我们的社会风气已经根本不同于过去了。旧社会遗留下来的坏习惯和坏风气已经改变了很多，但是还没有彻底改变。我国人民的经济生活在近几年来有了普遍的显著的提高，有些人就不注意节俭。我们看到有许多青年男女职工，没有家庭经济负担，这些年来一直没有感受什么生活上的困难，他们就不知道为他们将来成家立业、抚养子女做好一些准备。有些青年人甚至于一味追求物质享受，把钱尽情花掉、花光。这种情况是很不好的。这种作风同中国人民实现当前重大的历史任务的要求极不相称，就是为他们自己将来的日子作打算，这样也是很不利的。应该劝告他们把更多的钱省下来，努力增加积蓄。
    当然，我们同时也看到，由于几年来我国人民物质生活不断提高，广大群众受到社会主义建设伟大成就的鼓舞，社会主义觉悟空前高涨。现在，愈来愈多的人都踊跃地认购公债，作为个人积蓄的一种方法。也可以说，购买公债已经成为我国广大人民经济生活中的一件自觉的、不可缺少的事情了。据财政部统计，到今年9月底为止，全国人民认购的1957年度公债已经达到六亿五千万元，超额完成了原定发行计划。广大的爱国人民都要求国家增加公债的发行数额，并且在第二个五年计划期间继续发行，以便更快地更好地建设我们的祖国。这是有理由的。由于人民的购买力进一步提高，人民得到公债还本付息的收入逐年增多，在这种情况下，公债的发行数额当然也应该逐年有适当的增加。
    1958年度公债计划发行的数额，比过去略有增加——拟发行六亿三千万元，比1957年计划发行数增加三千万元。根据今年认购公债的情况来看，只要加强宣传教育，改进推销工作，明年度的公债推销计划是可以完成以至超额完成的。国家根据各阶层的具体情况，对明年度公债的分配，又做了合理的调整。各阶层分配比例虽然比今年有增有减，但是增减幅度都不算大。调整以后的比例，将更加接近于各阶层人民的经济担负能力，更加有利于整个国民经济的发展。这就为顺利完成和超额完成公债推销任务创造了更好的条件。
    明年度的公债付息办法也有些改变。新的办法规定，凡每年不中签的公债券，不再单独付给利息，一律在中签时一次总付本息。（过去几年发行的公债，付息办法照旧不变。）这是因为发行公债的期数逐年增加，每年付息的时间都规定在9月30日到12月底；而实际兑付时间又大都集中在开兑以后的十几天内。因此，在兑付公债利息的初期，往往发生拥挤的现象，浪费了群众的生产时间。同时，由于大多数群众购买的公债数额较小，利息有限，不每年付息也不会影响他们的生活。采用新的办法，反而可以使他们减少一些麻烦。由于推迟付息，国家还可把这部分利息用于建设事业。不难看出，采用新的付息办法，对于认购公债的人很方便，对国家好处也很大。这个办法一定会得到群众的拥护。
    那末，现在摆在我们面前的还有什么问题呢？有。这就要问：你准备明年认购多少公债？这个问题是每个人都应该考虑的。我们希望大家现在就来考虑。当然，要争取多买公债，首先要把生活安排得好。要大体做出家庭和个人的收支计划，在不影响必需的生活条件的情况下，本着节约朴素、勤俭持家的精神，努力认购公债。既不应该保守，也不应该只凭一时的热情。过去有些人在认购公债的时候报了很大的数目，但是由于生活开支没有计划，结果认购的数额并没有完全兑现。这种情况是应该避免的。
    几年来各阶层人民认购公债的情况证明，公债推销工作在我国广大职工（包括国家机关工作人员）当中总是完成得最为顺利。他们今年一共可以完成三亿七千多万元，大大超过了预定的指标（二亿八千万元）。这充分说明了我国工人阶级在社会主义建设事业中具有高度的自觉精神和主人翁态度。我们相信，广大职工在认购明年度的公债中一定能够继续发扬这种自觉精神和主人翁态度，争取超额认购。我们也希望其它阶层人民向全国职工学习，争取多购公债。
    我国农民如以户为单位平均计算，认购公债的数额很小；但是，由于他们人数最多，所以是一支不可忽视的力量。根据历年的经验，分配给农民的公债任务能否完成，关键在于能否做好推销工作。过去由各户农民分别认购、分别缴款的办法，既费事，又不容易完成任务，群众还有意见。为了改变这种情况，国务院已在今年发出指示，要求由农业社组织认购，由社分配到户，经过民主讨论，自愿完成认购数字，并且由农业社统一缴款。许多地区的事实证明，采用这个方法，不但可以顺利完成任务，同时群众也感到满意。
    第一个五年计划期间发行的公债，对于国家建设已经起了相当大的作用。在将要到来的第二个五年计划开始实行的1958年度，让我们更多地认购1958年度的公债，使我国的经济建设更加顺利地向前发展吧！
