President Zápotocký's close comrades-in-arms, Novotný, Široký, Barák, Ďuriš, Fierlinger, Kopecký, Jankovcová, and Šimůnek, were the first to stand guard next to President Zápotocký's remains. After them, the leaders of the Czechoslovak Communist Party and the government, as well as various people's organizations, took turns standing guard.

President Zápotocký's wife, daughters, and grandchildren, all dressed in mourning clothes, kept vigil before the coffin.

An endless stream of people continuously entered the Spanish Hall. They sadly bid farewell to President Zápotocký, and also drew more strength from him to build socialism.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, November 17th. ČTK reported that for four days, the Czechoslovak people have been mourning the death of President Zápotocký with unparalleled grief. The Czechoslovak capital has been continuously receiving telegrams and letters of condolence from all parts of the republic. Memorial services for Comrade Zápotocký are being held in cities and villages across the country.

The Academic Committee of Charles University held a memorial service in the "Carolinum" Hall in Prague, observing a minute of silence to mourn the death of President Zápotocký. Professor Procházka, the university president, gave a report on Zápotocký's life and activities at the meeting.

In Zakolany village near Prague—Zápotocký's birthplace—a memorial plaque has been erected on his simple former residence, which reads: "Antonín Zápotocký was born in this house on November 19, 1884." Workers from the Kladno factories and mines, as well as the working people from nearby villages, have been flocking here. The bust of Zápotocký erected on the cornerstone in front of the house is surrounded by flowers. Dozens of delegations have come to Zápotocký's hometown to express their condolences for the deceased president.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, November 17th. According to a report by ČTK, the funeral committee of Comrade Zápotocký announced that, according to the late President Zápotocký's will, his remains will be cremated, and the president's urn will be placed in the National Memorial Hall on Vitkov Hill next to the founders of the party and outstanding fighters of the party.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, November 17th. The autopsy report of President Zápotocký's remains was published here on the 16th, the full text of which is as follows:

The results of the autopsy on the remains of the late President Zápotocký are as follows: Coronary arteriosclerosis, causing narrowing of the arteries and several complete closures. These changes caused insufficient blood flow to the myocardium. An old scar caused by infarction was found on the posterior wall of the left ventricle, and many older and newer infarction sites were found in the remaining myocardium of the left ventricle. These new infarction sites are the cause of sudden heart failure and weakening. The autopsy results prove that the clinical diagnosis was completely correct. The nature and extent of the myocardial changes made it impossible for any medical treatment to prevent death.

    新华社布拉格17日电  捷克斯洛伐克各界人民向自己敬爱的总统安托宁·萨波托斯基同志告别。
    萨波托斯基总统的遗体已经安放在共和国总统府的西班牙大厅里。西班牙大厅和整个总统府里的镜子、窗户、吊灯都蒙着黑纱。大厅里铺着柏枝。在一面巨大的捷克斯洛伐克共和国红白蓝三色国旗下，萨波托斯基总统卧在一张饰有捷克斯洛伐克国旗和国徽的平台上。他穿着黑色的礼服。
    17日上午八时，第一批工人、农民、劳动妇女、士兵和机关工作者在哀乐中肃穆地走进了总统府。他们是从16日晚七时起就在总统府门前等候着来向他们的领袖致最后的敬礼的。在他们的后面，人民排着两三公里长的队伍。人们看到萨波托斯基总统熟悉的慈祥的面貌，便想起他生前不倦的革命活动和他对人民的亲切的教诲。许多人流下了眼泪。
    萨波托斯基总统的亲密战友诺沃提尼、西罗基、巴拉克、杜兰斯基、费林格、柯别茨基、扬科夫卓娃、西穆涅克是第一批站在萨波托斯基遗体旁边守灵的。在他们以后，捷克斯洛伐克共产党和政府以及各人民团体的负责人轮流守灵。

    卡罗瓦大学学术委员会在布拉格“卡罗利纽姆”大厅举行追悼会，默哀一分钟，对萨波托斯基总统的逝世表示哀悼。大学校长普罗哈兹卡教授在会上作了关于萨波托斯基的生平及其活动的报告。
    捷克斯洛伐克农业科学院主席团举行追悼会，悼念故总统，克列茨卡院士在会上讲述了萨波托斯基总统的生平。
    在布拉格附近扎科拉尼村——萨波托斯基的出生地，他的朴素的故居树立了一个纪念牌，上面写着：“安托宁·萨波托斯基于1884年11月19日生在这座房子里”。克拉德诺工厂和矿山的工人们以及附近各村庄的劳动人民都川流不息地到这里来。竖立在房前基石上面的萨波托斯基的胸像的四周洒满了鲜花。好几十个代表团来到萨波托斯基的故乡，对已故的总统表示哀悼。
    新华社布拉格17日电　据捷克斯洛伐克通讯社报道，萨波托斯基同志治丧委员会宣布，根据故总统萨波托斯基的遗嘱他的遗体将进行火葬，总统的骨灰瓮将放置在维特可夫山的国家纪念馆内党的创始人和党的杰出的战士旁边。
    新华社布拉格17日电　这里在16日公布了萨波托斯基总统遗体解剖的报告，全文如下：
    对故总统萨波托斯基的遗体进行解剖后发现结果如下：冠状动脉硬化，造成动脉狭窄和几处完全关闭。这些变化使流到心肌的血液不足。左心室后壁发现梗塞造成的旧瘢，左心室心肌其余部分发现许多更旧的和较新的梗塞部位。这些新的梗塞部位就是造成心脏突然衰竭和减弱的原因。遗体解剖结果证明临床诊断是完全正确的。心肌变化的性质和程度使一切医疗方法都不可能防止死亡。
