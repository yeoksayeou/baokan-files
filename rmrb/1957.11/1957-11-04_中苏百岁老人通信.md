    Sino-Soviet Centenarians Exchange Letters
    Feng Xingfa, an elderly man from the Qunli Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xinmin Township, Nanchong County, Sichuan Province, recently wrote a letter to the 148-year-old Soviet Azerbaijani, M. Enizov, congratulating him on being awarded the Soviet Order of the Red Banner of Labor and wishing him happiness brought to the working people by the October Revolution.
    Feng Xingfa said in his letter: "Dear elder brother: We are both laborers with thick calluses on our hands and wrinkles filled with sweat. Only with the Communist Party, who is like our own father, can we live a peaceful life in our old age."
    Feng Xingfa is 110 years old this year. He has no sons, only a daughter. The government is responsible for his clothing, food, and medical care. The county head even personally crossed the mountains to see him.
    Feng Xingfa began herding cattle for landlords at the age of eight, and became a hired hand at the age of eighteen, carrying sedan chairs—using his shoulders as stools for bureaucrats and landlords. His feet traveled all over the large and small counties of Sichuan. It was not until he was over sixty and unable to carry sedan chairs that he fled to Nanchong County, Sichuan, relying on villagers to give him some hillside land to cultivate, living a hard life of "fire as clothing, vegetables as food." In 1955, an agricultural production cooperative was established there, and the superiority of the collective economy brought them a bumper harvest. In his letter, Feng Xingfa expressed his desire to learn from M. Enizov, to achieve success in labor, and wished M. Enizov good health and longevity.

    中苏百岁老人通信
    四川省南充县新民乡群力农业生产合作社的老人冯兴发，最近写信给苏联阿塞拜疆一百四十八岁的马·艾尼佐夫，祝贺他获得苏联劳动红旗勋章，并且向他祝贺十月革命给劳动人民带来的幸福。
    冯兴发在信里说：“老大哥：我们都是手上起了厚茧，皱纹里浸满汗水的劳动人，有了我们亲爹样的共产党，我们才过着安然的晚年生活。”
    冯兴发今年一百一十岁了，没有儿子，只有一个女儿，衣、食、病等都由政府负责，县长还亲自翻过山来看他。
    冯兴发八岁起就给地主放牛，十八岁当长工，抬轿子——将肩膀给官僚、地主老爷当板凳，双足走遍了四川的大州小县，直到六十多岁抬不动轿子才逃到四川南充县，靠乡亲们送点坡地种，过着“火当衣裳、菜当粮”的苦生活。1955年，他们那里建立了农业生产合作社，集体经济的优越性使他们获得了丰收。冯兴发在信里表示要向马·艾尼佐夫学习，在劳动中获得成就，并且祝马·艾尼佐夫健康长寿。
