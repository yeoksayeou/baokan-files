Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, November 3rd: More than 900 organizations in Henan Province have successively entered the third stage of the rectification movement. Among them, more than 300 units have launched a vigorous airing of views.

According to statistics from twelve provincial-level units and the Luoyang and Xinyang special districts, as well as the Zhengzhou and Pingdingshan municipalities, in the past few days, the masses in various organizations have posted 90,000 big-character posters, offering more than 300,000 suggestions. These suggestions focus on exposing significant problems such as the harm caused by bloated organizations and the bureaucracy and subjectivism of leading cadres. One cadre from the Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative revealed: In the past, the sales department only had eighteen people, and they completed their tasks very well; cadres could also frequently go to the countryside. Now, there are more than one hundred people, but the work is not done well. A big-character poster from the Finance Department criticized a deputy director who, during an inspection in Huixian County in 1956, approved the county to retain an additional 870,000 jin of reserve grain subjectively, without investigation and research. The Zhengzhou Municipal Labor Bureau underestimated the political training the masses received in the anti-rightist struggle, doubting whether they could speak out freely, but once the masses were mobilized, the big-character posters and suggestions offered were four times more than during the first airing of views. The Henan Provincial Party Committee erected a hundred-zhang-long reed mat wall as a forum for airing views, and this forum was covered with four hundred big-character posters in two days.

Currently, the rectification leading groups of various units designate specific personnel to copy the opinions on the big-character posters item by item every day, to ensure timely summarization and timely resolution. Cadres in various units also offer suggestions through small-scale forums, heart-to-heart talks with leaders, and other methods. It is estimated that the opinions offered through these methods are far more numerous than those on the big-character posters.

    河南九百多机关转入整改阶段
    部分单位几天内贴出大字报九万张提出意见三十多万条
    新华社郑州3日电　河南省已经有九百多个机关先后转入整风运动的第三阶段。其中有三百多个单位已经展开大鸣大放。
    据省级十二个单位及洛阳、信阳两个专区，郑州、平顶山两个市的统计，几天来各机关群众已贴出大字报九万张，提出的意见有三十多万条。这些意见集中地揭露出了机构庞大，领导干部官僚主义、主观主义所造成的危害等重要问题。省供销合作社有一个干部揭露：推销处过去只有十八人，任务完成得很好，干部还能经常下乡，现在有一百多人，工作却做得不好。财政厅有一张大字报批评一个副厅长1956年到辉县检查工作时，不经调查研究，就主观主义地批准这个县多留八十七万斤机动粮。郑州市劳动局对群众在反右派斗争中所受到的政治锻炼估计不足，怀疑是否能鸣放得起来，可是群众一经发动，贴出的大字报和提出的意见比第一次鸣放时多了四倍。中共河南省委会搭起了一百多丈长的席墙作为鸣放园地，这块园地两天内就贴了四百张大字报。
    现在，各单位的整风领导小组每天都指定专人逐条抄下大字报上的意见，做到及时归纳、及时解决。各单位干部还通过小型座谈会、找领导谈心等方式提出意见，据估计，通过这些方法提出的意见比大字报上提出的意见还要多得多。
