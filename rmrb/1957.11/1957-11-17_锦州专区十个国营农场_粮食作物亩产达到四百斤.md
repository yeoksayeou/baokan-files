Xinhua News Agency, Jinzhou, 16th. This year, ten state-run grain demonstration farms in Jinzhou Prefecture, Liaoning Province, have reached or exceeded the requirements of the revised draft of the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule. The total grain crop area of these ten state-run grain demonstration farms is more than 15,800 mu, and the average yield per mu has reached 400 jin. This year, the average yield of sorghum and corn in Chaoyang State-Run Farm has exceeded 600 jin per mu.

The conditions of land, labor, and materials of these ten state-run grain demonstration farms are no better than those of the local agricultural cooperatives. Especially in terms of labor, they are far less adequate than the agricultural cooperatives. The reason they can achieve such high production targets is that they apply more fertilizer than agricultural cooperatives (but not more chemical fertilizer). On the other hand, they have universally adopted new agricultural technologies, strictly implemented operating procedures, and operated according to the seasons. Jinxian Farm adopted advanced technologies such as disinfecting rice seeds with mercury juice and artificial pollination of corn, and the yield of each crop this year exceeded 400 jin per mu.

    锦州专区十个国营农场
    粮食作物亩产达到四百斤
    新华社锦州16日电  辽宁省锦州专区今年有十个国营谷物示范农场的粮食生产指标，提前达到或超过了全国农业发展纲要修正草案的要求。这十个国营谷物示范农场粮食作物面积共一万五千八百多亩，平均每亩产量都达到了四百斤。朝阳国营农场今年的高粱、玉米，平均每亩都在六百斤以上。
    这十个国营谷物示范农场的土地、劳力、物力等条件，并不比当地农业社强，特别是劳动力，还远不如农业社充足。他们所以能达到这样高的生产指标，一方面施肥比农业社多（其中化学肥料不比农业社多），另方面是普遍采用了农业新技术，严格执行了操作规程和按季节作业。锦县农场水稻种子采用汞汁剂消毒、玉米实行人工扶助授粉等先进技术，今年各项作物产量每亩都超过了四百斤。
