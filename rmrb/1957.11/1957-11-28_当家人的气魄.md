    The Spirit of Being Masters of the House
    The workers of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company and Nanjing Chemical Plant actively organized rectification shock brigades and solved many problems themselves. In some workshops of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company, more than 70% of the workers participated in the shock brigades. Most of the thousands of problems closely related to production and workers raised by the employees of the entire company during the rectification movement were solved by the shock brigade members themselves.
    The exemplary actions of the rectification shock brigade members in these two units embody the spirit of the working class as masters of their own affairs. In some organizations and enterprises, some staff members have the following idea: Rectification is a matter for the leaders. I can raise problems, but whether or not they are rectified depends on you leaders. This idea is obviously incorrect. It is true that in the rectification movement, improving work is mainly the responsibility of the leadership, and some problems can only be solved by the leaders. However, how to make the work of organizations and enterprises take on a new look during the rectification movement is everyone's responsibility; in fact, many problems can and even must be solved by everyone.
    Not only that, but everyone's participation can also make problems solved faster and better. For example, the acid dripping and smoke leakage in the barrel crystallization process of the nitration workshop of Nanjing Chemical Plant was an old problem that existed since 1951, and it usually took eight or nine days to repair; this time, the shock brigade divided into three shifts and worked day and night, and it was repaired in only three days. For another example, the workers in the machine repair workshop of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company did not have hot water to wash their hands in winter, which troubled everyone; this time, the rectification shock brigade of the fitter section volunteered and installed a 300-meter-long thick water pipe in more than a week of spare time, solving the problem. The entire project did not cost a penny.
    There are so many benefits to everyone solving problems together. The problem is that everyone gives play to their sense of responsibility as masters and actively participates in the upsurge of rectification.
    The leaders of organizations and enterprises should first take responsibility for rectification. However, in the process of rectification, be sure to remember to implement the mass line, and do not work alone.

### 当家人的气魄

    当家人的气魄
    重庆钢铁公司和南京化工厂的职工积极组织整改突击队，自己动手解决了许多问题。重庆钢铁公司有的车间70％以上的工人都参加了突击队。全公司职工在整风运动中提出的成千上万个同生产和工人有密切关系的问题，多数是由突击队员们自己动手解决的。
    这两个单位整改突击队员们的模范行动，体现了工人阶级当家做主的气魄。在有些机关、企业里，有一部分工作人员有这样一种想法：整改是领导人员的事情。有问题我可以提，至于改不改，就看你们领导人员了。这种想法显然是不正确的。不错，在整风运动中，改进工作主要是领导方面的责任，有些问题也只能由领导人员去解决。但是，如何使机关、企业的工作在整风运动中面貌一新，却是人人有责；实际上，许多问题都是可以甚至必须由大家动手解决的。
    不仅如此，大家动手，还可以使问题解决得更快更好。例如，南京化工厂硝化车间桶式结晶工序滴酸漏烟是从1951年就存在的老问题，修理起来通常需要八、九天时间；这次突击队分成三班日夜劳动，仅用三天时间就修好了。再如，重庆钢铁公司机修车间工人过去在冬天没有热水洗手，大伙很伤脑筋；这次钳工段整改突击大队自告奋勇，用一周多的业余时间，安装好了一条三百多公尺长的粗水管，解决了这个问题。全部工程没有花一个钱。
    大伙动手解决问题有这么多好处。问题就在于大家都发挥主人翁的责任感，都积极主动地投入整改高潮。
    机关、企业的领导人员应该首先负起整改的责任。但是，在改的当中，一定要记住贯彻群众路线，切不可以单干。
