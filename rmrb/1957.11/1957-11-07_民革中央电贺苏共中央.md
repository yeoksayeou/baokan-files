Xinhua News Agency, November 6th: The Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang sent a telegram to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on November 6th, congratulating them on the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution. The telegram reads as follows:
To: The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union:

    On the occasion of celebrating the 40th anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution, the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang extends warm, fraternal congratulations to you and, through you, to the entire Soviet people.

    The victory of the October Revolution and the founding of the Soviet Union fundamentally shook the rule of imperialism, giving all oppressed classes and oppressed nations infinite hope, confidence, and courage, and opening up broad paths for the liberation cause of people of all countries.

    The great Union of Soviet Socialist Republics is the most beloved teacher and dearest friend of the Chinese people. The Soviet Union has not only given us invaluable assistance in revolutionary theory and experience but also provided much significant direct support for the liberation cause of our people. As Chairman Mao Zedong said: "The October Revolution enabled the Chinese people to find the road to complete liberation and prosperity. The Chinese people have received tremendous sympathy and generous assistance from the Soviet people in their cause. The people of our two countries have forged a fraternal alliance in their common struggle. No force in the world can separate us."

    Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, inheriting and carrying forward Mr. Sun Yat-sen's spirit of "learning from Russia," will forever stand with the entire Chinese people, resolutely follow the path of the October Revolution, and consolidate and develop the unbreakable friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union.

    Long live the great October Socialist Revolution!

    Long live the great friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union!

    The Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang
            November 6, 1957, Beijing

    新华社6日讯　中国国民党革命委员会中央委员会6日致电苏联共产党中央委员会，祝贺十月革命四十周年。电文如下：苏联共产党中央委员会：
    值此伟大的十月社会主义革命四十周年之际，中国国民党革命委员会向你们，并通过你们向全体苏联人民，致以热烈的、兄弟般的祝贺。
    十月革命的胜利和苏联的成立，从根本上动摇了帝国主义的统治，给一切被压迫阶级和被压迫民族以无限的希望、信心和勇气，给各国人民的解放事业开辟了广阔的道路。
    伟大的苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟，是中国人民最敬爱的导师和挚友。苏联不仅在革命理论和经验上给了我们以无可估量的帮助，而且对我国人民的解放事业作了许多重大的直接的支援。正像毛泽东主席所说的：“十月革命使中国人民找到了彻底解放和繁荣富强的道路。中国人民在自己的事业中得到苏联人民巨大的同情和慷慨的援助。我们两国人民已经在共同的斗争中结成了兄弟般的同盟。世界上没有任何力量可以把我们分开。”
    中国国民党革命委员会在中国共产党的领导下，继承和发扬孙中山先生“以俄为师”的精神，永远和全中国人民一道，坚决地走十月革命的道路，巩固和发展中苏两国人民牢不可破的友谊。
    伟大的十月社会主义革命万岁！
    中苏两国人民的伟大友谊万岁！
