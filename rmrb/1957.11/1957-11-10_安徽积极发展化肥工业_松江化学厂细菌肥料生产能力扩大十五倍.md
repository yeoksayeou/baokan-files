    Anhui Actively Develops Fertilizer Industry
    Songjiang Chemical Plant Expands Bacterial Fertilizer Production Capacity Fifteenfold
    Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 8th - Anhui Province is actively developing the chemical fertilizer industry. At present, some auxiliary projects for a calcium cyanamide plant being built in Hefei have already begun construction, and it is expected to be completed and put into production by the fourth quarter of next year. Preparations for a larger ammonium sulfate plant are also being stepped up, and the Provincial Department of Industry has organized a plant selection team to select a site. Once these two plants are put into production, they will be able to produce 210,000 tons of ammonium sulfate and 30,000 tons of calcium cyanamide annually. These chemical fertilizers can be used on approximately 36.07 million mu of grain and cotton fields.
    Many areas of Anhui Province have discovered raw materials for manufacturing ammonium sulfate - pyrite ore. A pyrite prospecting team has been conducting prospecting in Fanchang County since August of last year. According to preliminary prospecting results, the Moying Stone and Shizi Mountain pyrite in Fanchang County are considered to be of mining value. In addition, pyrite ore has also been discovered in Guichi, Qingyang, Taihu, and Yuexi. At the same time, Anhui also has relatively abundant coal resources needed to manufacture fertilizer.
    Currently, the industrial departments of Anhui Province have transferred dozens of engineers and technicians to the Nanjing Yongli Chemical Plant to learn chemical fertilizer production technology, in preparation for the future production of new plants.
    Xinhua News Agency, Harbin - The state-owned Songjiang Chemical Plant in Heilongjiang Province recently expanded the production capacity of its bacterial fertilizer workshop fifteenfold. By the spring planting season in March next year, it will produce bacterial fertilizers for one million hectares (one hectare equals fifteen mu) of farmland. The use of these fertilizers can increase grain production by more than 400 million jin. The plant has decided to invest another 60,000 yuan next year, preparing to produce bacterial fertilizers capable of supplying 150 million mu of farmland before the spring plowing of 1959.
    Last year, with the assistance of the Academy of Agricultural Sciences in Gongzhuling in providing strains and technical guidance, the factory began small-scale production of bacterial fertilizers such as azotobacter and phosphate bacteria. During this year's spring planting, after state farms such as Jiu San and Hongxing in Heilongjiang Province used this bacterial fertilizer on 7,000 hectares of farmland, the autumn harvest increased by 17% to 40% compared to farmland without fertilizer. The average increase was 400 jin of grain per hectare. The effect of using bacterial fertilizer was particularly good on newly reclaimed land that was cultivated and sown in the same year.
    Bacterial fertilizer can help crops such as wheat and soybeans absorb nutrients, nitrogen, and phosphorus from the soil. It is sown together with the crop seeds. Bacterial fertilizer is inexpensive, costing only five cents to fertilize one hectare of land, and it is small in volume. The bacterial fertilizer needed to fertilize one hectare of land can be transported in a box the size of a soap dish.

    安徽积极发展化肥工业
    松江化学厂细菌肥料生产能力扩大十五倍
    新华社合肥8日电　安徽省正在积极发展化学肥料工业。目前，在合肥兴建的一座石灰氮厂的部分辅助工程已经开始施工，预计到明年第四季度就能建成投入生产。一座规模较大的硫酸铵厂的筹建工作也在加紧进行，省工业厅已组织了选厂小组进行厂址的选择。这两个厂投入生产以后，每年能生产硫酸铵二十一万吨，石灰氮三万吨。这些化学肥料，可以供粮、棉田约三千六百零七万亩使用。
    安徽省有不少地区发现了制造硫酸铵的原料——黄铁矿石。一个普查黄铁矿的普查队，从去年8月份就开始在繁昌县进行普查；据初步普查的结果，认为繁昌县的磨鹰石和狮子山的黄铁矿，都有开采价值。此外，贵池、青阳、太湖和岳西等地，也都发现有黄铁矿石。同时，制造化肥所需要的煤炭资源安徽地区也比较丰富。
    现在，安徽省工业部门已经抽调数十名工程技术人员，前往南京永利化工厂学习化肥的生产技术，为将来新厂的投入生产作准备。
    据新华社哈尔滨电　黑龙江省地方国营松江化学厂最近把制造细菌肥料车间的生产能力扩大了十五倍，到明年3月春播时，将生产出一百万公顷（一公顷合十五市亩）农田使用的细菌肥料。使用这些肥料可以增产粮食四亿多斤。这个厂决定在明年再投资六万元，准备在1959年春耕前，制造出能供给一亿五千多万亩农田使用的细菌肥料。
    去年，这个工厂在公主岭的农业科学研究所供给菌种和技术指导的协助下，开始小规模生产固氮菌、磷细菌等细菌肥料。今年春播时，黑龙江省九三、红星等二十多个国营农场的七千公顷农田使用了这种细菌肥料以后，秋收时都比没有施肥料的农田增产17％到40％，平均每公顷可增产四百斤粮食，当年开垦当年播种的新垦地使用细菌肥料的效果特别好。
    细菌肥料能帮助小麦、大豆等农作物吸收土壤中的养料氮和磷。它是同作物种子拌在一起施播的。细菌肥料价格低廉，施一公顷田只需花五分钱，而且它的体积小，施一公顷田的细菌肥料，只要用一个肥皂盒那样大的盒子来装运。
