Many of the cadres who were sent to the Hongxing Collective Farm on the outskirts of Beijing to participate in labor production are women. When reporters asked them how they overcame their family concerns, they eagerly told of their husbands' support and encouragement, and how their husbands managed the housework well after they went to the countryside. This is the story of one such family. The female head of this family, Li Shushi, is an intellectual who used to work in the Beijing Women's Federation. She has been sent to the countryside for more than a month, but her departure has not caused any difficulties at home, because her husband, Zhou Yajun, has admirably taken on the responsibilities of a mother. Her four children also have more opportunities to develop their independent living skills because their mother is not at home. Therefore, Li Shushi quickly got used to physical labor in a pleasant mood and developed a strong affection for it. Xinhua News Agency reporter Lü Houmin, Liu Qingrui photographed.

    With mother away, the responsibility of helping the children with their homework falls on the father.
    
    The eldest daughter, Zhou Ping (left), has begun to learn housework. She helps with cooking and washing clothes, and she is also responsible for handling the money for buying groceries. This is her teaching her younger sister, Zhou Fang (right), how to wash clothes after school.
    
    Going to the countryside to see mother! is the most exciting thing for the children. In order to cultivate the children's affection for the countryside, Li Shushi takes them to visit the farm and often tells them about the lives of the farmers. Li Shushi said, "This livestock farm currently has one hundred and ninety-eight dairy cows, and in another five years it will increase to one thousand and eighty."

    妈妈下乡参加生产去了
    下放到北京市郊红星集体农庄参加劳动生产的下放干部中，有不少是妇女同志。当记者访问她们如何摆脱家庭的顾虑时，她们争相诉说自己的丈夫对她们的支持和鼓励，她们下乡后，丈夫处理家务有方。这里介绍的是其中一个家庭。这个家庭的女主人李淑世是一个知识分子，原在北京市妇联工作。她已下放到农村一个多月了，但家中并没有因为她的离开而发生困难，因为她的爱人周亚君很出色地兼顾了做母亲的责任。她的四个孩子也因为妈妈不在家，有更多的机会来培养自己独立生活的能力。因此李淑世在愉快的情绪中很快便习惯了体力劳动，并且对它已发生了浓厚的感情。　新华社记者　吕厚民、刘庆瑞摄
    李淑世正在棉田里和老社员们一起摘棉桃。
    妈妈不在家，帮助孩子们复习功课的责任便落在爸爸的身上了。
    大女儿周平（左）开始学习家务劳动。她帮助做饭、洗衣服，买小菜的钱也由她负责处理。这是她下课后，教妹妹周放（右）学洗衣服。
    到农村看妈妈去！是孩子们最感兴奋的事情。为了培养孩子们对农村的感情，李淑世带着他们参观农庄，并经常向他们介绍农民的生活。李淑世说：“这个畜牧场现有乳牛一百九十八头，再过五年就会增加到一千零八十头了。”
