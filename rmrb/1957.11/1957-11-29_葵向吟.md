　　Although my years show signs of decline, my heart is still surging with passion—
　　I long to ride a swift horse and gallop towards the frontier;
　　I long to wield the plow and cultivate vast agricultural estates.
　　The nation has domestically produced aircraft that can soar freely.
　　Railways extend across the vast deserts, and great bridges span the Yangtze River.
　　Rows of trees are planted everywhere, and every village is fragrant with rice and wheat.
　　Dry lands are irrigated, and terraced fields climb the mountainsides.
　　A nation once plagued by thousands of disasters now celebrates abundant harvests year after year.
　　A hundred schools of thought contend, and a hundred flowers bloom in fragrance.
　　Workers and peasants support each other, their alliance as strong as steel.
　　Factories and mines stand like forests, their scale so magnificent!
　　Millions are of one mind, with lofty vision and soaring spirit,
　　To solidify the foundation for the Party and increase the wealth and strength of the nation.
　　To achieve world peace and manifest blessings and virtues among humanity.
　　Alas, in the first half of my life, I walked aimlessly in confusion,
　　How fortunate that in middle age, I have gained access to the light of truth!
　　The people are led to rise up together and drive away the tigers and wolves,
　　Washing away the filth and building a brilliant future day by day.
　　What is valued is a selfless heart, with unwavering loyalty and a passionate spirit.
　　In the great communist family, the "self" can be forgotten for the sake of the collective.
　　Great enemies are still present, and crises lurk in all directions.
　　Be diligent and thrifty in building the nation, diligent and thrifty in improving the homeland,
　　Accumulate strength without懈怠, so as to avoid慌乱 when facing difficulties.
　　The wise Party issues instructions, leading to happiness and well-being.
　　The great cause for ten thousand generations, must be maintained with diligence and constancy.
　　I lie ill in my small room, reading the newspaper's magnificent words,
　　How great are the two declarations, shining with boundless light!
　　The victorious meeting in Moscow, strengthens the solid alliance.
　　The force for peace grows stronger, saving humanity from carnage.
　　Benefiting people surpasses heaven, and the reputation of benevolence and righteousness spreads far and wide.
　　The imperialists are in decline, filled with futile worry and fear.
　　The people turn to the truth, and its power is unstoppable.
　　Looking forward along the great road, the beauty is immeasurable.
　　Raising my arms, I want to dance, and the long song expresses even longer intentions!

    葵向吟	欧阳予倩
    年力显衰迈，予怀正沸扬——
    我欲骑骏马，飞步向边疆；
    我欲掌耒耜，万里辟农庄。
    国有自制机，可以任翱翔。
    铁道通广漠，大桥架长江。
    处处树成行，村村稻麦香。
    旱地通水利，梯田上山岗。
    千灾万难国，逐年庆丰穰。
    百家辩是非，百卉竞芬芳。
    工农互支援，联盟坚似钢。
    厂矿如林立，规模何堂皇！
    万众同一心，高瞻气势昂，
    为党固事基，为国增富强。
    世界和平致，人间福德彰。
    嗟予前半生，局促走彷徨，
    何幸中年后，获见真理光！
    人民得领导，共起逐虎狼，
    腥膻洗涤净，建设日辉煌。
    所贵无私心，公忠具热肠。
    共产大家庭，为群“我”可忘。
    大敌尚当前，危机伏四方。
    勤俭以建国，勤俭整家乡，
    蓄力无懈怠，临事免周张。
    英明党召示，从以致乐康。
    千秋万岁业，辛勤持以常。
    我病卧斗室，读报字琳琅，
    伟哉两宣言，万丈闪光芒！
    胜会莫斯科，团结固金汤。
    和平力壮大，人类免杀伤。
    造福人胜天，仁义声洋洋。
    帝国主义者，衰败徒忧惶。
    人民向真理，其势不可当。
    展望循大道，美好难衡量。
    振臂欲起舞，长歌意更长！
          （一九五七年冬病中作）
