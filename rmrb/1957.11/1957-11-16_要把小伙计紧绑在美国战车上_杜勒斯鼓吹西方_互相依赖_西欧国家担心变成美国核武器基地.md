Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 14th: U.S. Secretary of State Dulles reiterated on the 13th that Western countries should be more "interdependent," and demanded that the American people sacrifice some "freedom" to support the U.S. government's plan to intensify its arms expansion.

Dulles delivered a speech at a meeting of the "National Defense Reserve Organization." He admitted that the Soviet Union had made tremendous achievements in science. He said that to catch up with the Soviet Union in science and military affairs, Western countries must accept a "greater degree of interdependence than at present." He said that the gist of the statement issued by British Prime Minister Macmillan after his talks with Eisenhower was "mutual reliance."

Dulles vigorously advocated the plan to tie Western countries to the American war chariot. He said that in order to "unite" Western countries, the "common security" plan for the United States to help other countries expand their armies is "necessary."

He hopes that the American people will sacrifice some "freedom" to support the government's efforts to expand its arms and prepare for war.

Xinhua News Agency, London, 14th: Among the continental European countries participating in the North Atlantic Group, people have recently expressed obvious concerns that their countries will become American nuclear weapon bases. At the North Atlantic Group parliamentary meeting held in Paris, some parliamentarians stated that if a war were to break out, the threat to their countries as American nuclear weapon bases would increase, and this threat would greatly outweigh the "guarantee" obtained by storing nuclear weapons.

It is generally believed that the so-called "convergence" of the scientific research of the North Atlantic Group countries will not result in all countries sharing research information, but only in the United States obtaining information from other member states.

    要把小伙计紧绑在美国战车上
    杜勒斯鼓吹西方“互相依赖”
    西欧国家担心变成美国核武器基地
    据新华社14日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务卿杜勒斯13日再次鼓吹西方国家要更多地“互相依赖”，并且要求美国人民牺牲一些“自由”来支持美国政府加紧扩充军备的计划。
    杜勒斯在“国防负责人员后备组织”的一个会议上发表演说。他承认，苏联在科学方面已经获得了巨大的成就。他说，要在科学和军事方面赶上苏联，西方国家就必须接受一种“程度比现在为大的相互依赖”。他说，英国首相麦克米伦在同艾森豪威尔会谈后发表的声明的主旨就是“互相依靠”。
    杜勒斯竭力鼓吹把西方国家拴在美国战车上的计划。他说，为了把西方国家“团结在一起”，美国帮助其他国家扩军的“共同安全”计划是“必要”的。
    他希望美国人民牺牲一些“自由”来支持政府的扩军备战的努力。
    据新华社伦敦14日电　在参加北大西洋集团的欧洲大陆各国中，最近人们明显地表示担心自己的国家将变成美国的核武器基地。在巴黎举行的北大西洋集团议员会议上，一些议员表示，如果一旦发生战争，他们的国家作为美国核武器基地所遭受的威胁将要增加，这种威胁将大大地超过由于储存了核武器而获得的“保障”。
    一般认为，所谓“汇合”北大西洋集团各国的科学研究，结果也并不会是所有的国家共同享受研究的情报，而只是美国从其他成员国方面获得情报。
