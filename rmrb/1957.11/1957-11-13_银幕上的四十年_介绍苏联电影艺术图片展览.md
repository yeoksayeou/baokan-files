    Forty Years on the Silver Screen
    —An Introduction to the Soviet Film Art Photo Exhibition
    Su Fang
    The Soviet Film Art Forty Years Photo Exhibition, jointly sponsored by the Ministry of Culture and the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, features over 600 stills from 179 films. These pictures summarize the path that Soviet cinema has taken, and also allow us to clearly see what beautiful and splendid flowers bloom in the garden of Soviet film art!
    Since August 27, 1919, when Lenin signed the decree on the nationalization of the photographic film business, all film enterprises in the Soviet Republic became the property of the socialist state. From then on, audiences no longer saw films on the screen that mainly dealt with "sexual issues"—the main theme of Russian bourgeois films—but rather new chapters in the history of the Soviet people. The written materials and charts in the exhibition tell us that under the leadership of the Soviet Party and government, the film industry has developed rapidly over the past forty years. At present, the Soviet Union has thirty-four film studios, which mass-produce films in various national languages. These films are not only loved by the Soviet people, but also welcomed by people all over the world.
    The Chinese people, who are as close as brothers to the Soviet people, sincerely love Soviet films. We will never forget the endless spiritual inspiration that Soviet films have given us for a long time. However, we have not had much contact with early Soviet films. So, let us take a look at some representative works of early Soviet films through the exhibited stills.
    Here, we see some of the best works from the silent film era of 1919 to 1930: the image of the young Red Army soldier in "Little Red Devils" is so clever and heroic; in "Battleship Potemkin," the scene of the mutinying sailors gathering is so magnificent; in "Mother," the sad, tearful face of the mother also deeply touches our hearts; in addition, we can also see the fragments of the late film master Dovzhenko's "Earth" and the "New Babylon" produced by the Leningrad Youth Film Workers' Comedy Film Studio, all of which greatly enhance our understanding of Soviet films in the silent film era.
    After 1931, the advent of sound films opened up a new era in Soviet film art, making Soviet films more expressive. Early Soviet sound films such as "Road to Life," "Golden Mountains," and "We Are From Kronstadt" were screened in our country twenty years ago, inspiring the fighting spirit of our people and giving great inspiration and education to our filmmakers. In the sound film section of the exhibition, we saw fragments of these historically significant films and some shots from the films "Chapayev," "The Young Guard," and "The Village Teacher," which we are very familiar with. These precious fragments evoked all the memories of the film content, and suddenly reminded us of the images of many heroic characters.
    The exhibited pictures fully demonstrate that Soviet films have serious themes and focus on reflecting major contemporary political events and the lives of the people. During the period from 1941 to 1945, when the Soviet people opposed the German fascist aggression, film art focused on depicting the people's indomitable fighting will and the immortal achievements of patriotic heroes. Films such as "Secretary of the District Committee" and "The Boy From Our Town" were produced during this period. After the victory of the Great Patriotic War, more films appeared that praised ordinary people and peaceful labor, such as "A Big Family," "A Lesson in Life," and "An Unfinished Story."
    The exhibited pictures also fully demonstrate the breadth of Soviet film themes and the diversity of styles: there are descriptions of revolutionary heroes, descriptions of the fate of young people, and themes based on family and marriage issues...; there are comedies, musicals, biographical films, children's films, sports films... Films of various themes and styles shine with their own unique brilliance, constituting the spectacle of Soviet film art!
    The last part of the exhibition is mostly pictures of newly released Soviet films such as "Two Sisters" and "Different Fates." From those beautiful and exquisite pictures, we can imagine the beauty and moving nature of the works themselves, and also allow us to look forward to a more brilliant future for Soviet film art.

    银幕上的四十年
    ——介绍苏联电影艺术图片展览
    苏方
    文化部和中苏友好协会总会联合举办的苏联电影艺术四十年图片展览，展出了一百七十九部影片的六百多幅剧照。这些图片概括地介绍了苏联电影所经过的途径，同时也使我们清楚地看到，苏联电影艺术园地里盛开着多么美丽和绚烂的花朵！
    自从1919年8月27日，列宁签署了关于照像电影事业国有化的法令以后，苏维埃共和国一切电影企业就成为社会主义国家的财产。从那时起，观众从银幕上看到的便不再是以处理“性问题”——俄国资产阶级电影的主要主题——为主的影片，而是苏联人民历史的新的篇章了。展览会上的文字材料和图表告诉我们：四十年来，在苏联党和政府的领导下，电影事业有了飞跃的发展。目前苏联已拥有三十四个电影制片厂，制片厂大量生产各种民族语言的影片。这些影片不仅为苏联人民所热爱，也受到世界各国人民的欢迎。
    同苏联人民亲如兄弟的中国人民，是衷心喜爱苏联电影的。我们永远不会忘记苏联影片长时期来给予我们精神上的无尽的鼓舞力量。但是我们对早期的苏联电影接触得并不多。那么，让我们通过展出的剧照，看看早期苏联电影的一些代表作吧。
    在这里，我们看到了1919至1930年默片时期的一些佳作：“红小儿”里的红军小战士的形象，是那么机灵而又英勇；“战舰波将金号”里，起义的水兵们群集的场面是如此雄伟；“母亲”中，充满了忧伤的含泪的母亲的面孔，也深深地扣动了我们的心弦；此外，我们还可以看到已逝的电影大师杜甫仁科的“工地”，以及一批列宁格勒的青年电影工作者创办的滑稽电影制片厂出的“新巴比伦”等影片的片断，这些，都大大加强了我们对默片时期的苏联电影的了解。
    1931年以后，有声电影的出现，开辟了苏联电影艺术的新时代，使得苏联电影更加富于表现力了。苏联早期的有声片如“生路”、“金山”、“我们来自喀琅斯塔得”等，二十年前就曾在我国放映过，鼓舞了我国人民的斗志，并且给予我国电影工作者极大的启发和教育。在展出的有声片这一部分中，我们又看到了这些富有历史意义的影片的片断和我们非常熟悉的“夏伯阳”、“青年近卫军”、“乡村女教师”等影片中的一些镜头。这些珍奇的片断，勾起了我们对于影片内容的全部的回忆，一下子想起许许多多英雄人物的形象。
    展出的图片充分表明：苏联电影是有着严肃的主题，着力于反映当代重大政治事件和人民生活的艺术。1941年至1945年苏联人民反对德国法西斯侵略时期，电影艺术便着重在描写人民的不屈不挠的斗争意志，爱国英雄的不朽业绩。“区委书记”、“我城一少年”等影片，便是这个时期的出品。而在卫国战争胜利以后，则出现了更多的歌颂普通人，歌颂和平劳动的如“大家庭”、“生活的一课”、“没有说完的故事”等影片。
    展出的图片也充分表明了苏联电影的题材的广泛性和样式的多样性：有描写革命英雄的，有描写青年的命运的，有以家庭、婚姻问题为题材的……；有喜剧片，音乐片，传记片，儿童片，体育片……。各种题材各种样式的影片闪射着自己特有的光芒，构成了苏联电影艺术的奇观！
    展览会陈列出的最后一部分图片，大都是苏联新出的影片如“两姊妹”、“不同的命运”等的剧照，从那些美丽精巧的画面中，我们可以想见作品本身的优美动人，也使我们瞻望到苏联电影艺术的更加辉煌的未来。
