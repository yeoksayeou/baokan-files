Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 9th: Farmers living in the deep mountains and old forests of northern Hubei can now also eat fresh fish and tender lotus roots.

Before 1955, Jun County, Hubei Province, had few ponds, dikes, and reservoirs, and rarely raised fish or grew lotus roots. It was not until 1955 that the county began stocking 80,000 fish. Last winter and this spring, Jun County built more than 2,500 new water conservancy projects. This year, the number of fish stocked has increased to one million. The Guangming Agricultural Cooperative in Daliushu Township expects its income from selling fish to reach more than 1,000 yuan by the end of the year. This year, the area planted with lotus roots in the county has also expanded by more than 1,600 mu. There are 2,750 places in the county where agricultural cooperatives collectively manage and members grow lotus roots themselves, with a total output of more than 4.68 million jin of lotus roots. Many members of the Mingxing No. 1 Cooperative in Xijiadian Township used to have to cross mountains and ridges to fetch water from rivers several miles away. In the past two years, thanks to vigorously building water conservancy projects, not only has the problem of drinking water been solved, but also members have established their own small lotus ponds in front of or behind their houses. This year, each household harvested an average of 80 jin of lotus roots, and the cooperative also stocked 5,000 fish.

    高山养鱼又种藕
    据新华社武汉9日电　居住在鄂北深山老林里的农民，现在也能吃到鲜鱼和嫩藕了。
    湖北均县在1955年以前，由于塘、壋和水库少，很少养鱼种藕。直到1955年，全县才开始放养八万尾鱼。去冬今春均县新修了两千五百多处水利工程，到今年放养的鱼已增加到一百万尾。大柳树乡光明农业社预计到年底卖鱼的收入可达一千多元。今年这个县种藕面积又扩大了一千六百多亩，全县农业社集体经营和社员自己种的藕有两千七百五十处，总共可以产藕四百六十八万多斤。习家店乡明星一社有许多社员，过去连吃水也要翻山越岭到几里路以外的河里挑，近两年由于大力兴修水利，不但解决了吃水问题，而且社员都在门前或屋后建立了自己的小藕池，今年平均每户收八十斤藕，社里还放养了五千尾鱼。
