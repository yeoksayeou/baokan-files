    Labor Education and Labor Practice	Liu Zijiu
    All kinds of education we conduct for young people, such as school education, family education, social education, etc., are of the nature of labor education from the perspective of its purpose. Take the military and political education that our People's Liberation Army conducts for its officers and soldiers as an example. On the surface, it seems to have nothing to do with labor education, but its purpose is nothing more than: liberating or protecting the social labor productivity; defending the place of labor and the fruits of labor. There is nothing that is not related to labor.
    The specific content of labor education for the people is diverse and difficult to list one by one. But if we summarize their content or purpose, it can be roughly divided into three types:
      First, it is to make them understand the meaning and role of labor, so that they consciously carry out labor, let them know that labor is glorious, and that eating without labor is shameful, in order to give full play to their enthusiasm for labor. This is the main content and purpose of conducting "moral education" for the people, especially young people, under the socialist system. Make the people, especially the young people, understand that loving labor and not loving labor is the main sign to judge whether a person's character is good or bad. Therefore, in the socialist society we are in today, labor models, labor heroes, advanced producers, and advanced workers have become titles of supreme glory.
    Second, it is to teach them the knowledge and technology of how to carry out labor, and highly develop their creativity in labor, so that they can labor more, faster, better, more economically, and more safely. This is the main content and purpose of conducting "intellectual education" for the people, especially young people, under the socialist system. The amount of labor, speed, quality, saving or waste, safety or unsafety are the main signs to judge a person's ability, knowledge, and experience.
    Third, it is to make them exercise their bodies, so that their physique is strong, and they can persistently and stubbornly carry out labor, and will not have the frustration and pain of being willing (very willing to labor) but not strong enough (the body cannot support it). This is the main content and purpose of conducting "physical education" for the people, especially young people, under the socialist system.
    Then, since all kinds of education we conduct for young people are of the nature of labor education, why should we emphasize labor education for young people, especially young students? The labor education we are emphasizing now is not the broad labor education mentioned above, but specifically refers to the labor education of physical labor that directly participates in industrial and agricultural production. Why do we particularly emphasize the labor education of physical labor that directly participates in industrial (including transportation, basic construction, and other various handicrafts) and agricultural production for young students? First of all, because this physical labor of directly participating in industrial and agricultural production is the foundation for human society to survive, develop, and grow. Without this labor, we cannot obtain the material resources necessary for human survival and development. The so-called "labor creates the world" labor primarily and mainly refers to this physical labor. Without this labor, even the survival of mankind itself cannot be sustained, and naturally everything else is out of the question.
    Secondly, because after human society had classes (had exploitation), the idea of despising physical labor of "mental workers rule people, and manual workers are ruled by people" occurred. This idea has a deep-rooted influence in people's minds. And the essence of this idea of despising physical labor is a kind of exploiting class thought. In order to break this exploiting class thought of despising physical labor, it is necessary to strengthen labor education for physical labor that directly participates in industrial and agricultural production. Make them understand that the so-called glorious labor primarily and mainly refers to this physical labor engaged in industrial and agricultural production, and this physical labor has a decisive role in the national economy and the people's livelihood.
    Thirdly, it is because of the backwardness of our country's economic and technological development. At present, and even for a considerable period of time, this physical labor of directly participating in industrial and agricultural production is still a means of making a living for people, and cannot become the first need of people's lives. Therefore, in order to make people consciously and voluntarily engage in this heavy labor with not very high labor productivity, it is necessary to patiently and repeatedly carry out ideological and political education work, so that the broad masses of young students understand that if we want to transform the current heavy labor with low labor productivity into light and pleasant labor with high labor productivity, it requires a long and arduous struggle process. Without today's heavy labor with low labor productivity, there would be no tomorrow's light and pleasant labor with high labor productivity and prosperous and happy life. It must be known that labor becomes the first need of human life, even if labor becomes light and pleasant labor with high labor productivity, it is the result of the high development of human culture, science, and technology after the system of man exploiting man is eliminated, and the development of any science and technology is impossible without the production of material resources on which human beings depend for survival as the foundation.
  At present, our country's science and technology are still very backward and the population is very large, which determines that heavy labor and simple labor still occupy a large proportion in the various production labor in our country at present. Therefore, at present, when we carry out labor education for the broad masses of young students in schools, we must grasp the two characteristics of the large population and backward economic and technological development in our country, otherwise it will be difficult to prescribe the right medicine and get through their thoughts. At present, the purpose of strengthening labor education is to make them consciously and voluntarily engage in the physical labor of industrial production and agricultural production that is still quite heavy, the labor conditions are not good enough, the technology is relatively simple, and the labor productivity is not very high, and gradually reduce its heavy degree, improve its labor conditions, carry out technological transformation, and improve labor productivity on the basis of this physical labor. It must be known that this physical labor engaged in industrial and agricultural production is not only a sign to judge whether people are good or bad, but also one of the most effective means to change bad people into good people.
    Since, at present, in our country, this heavy and simple physical labor is caused by the historical conditions of our country's backward economic technology and large population, our task is to use all means to change this reality, but we must never fantasize about leaving this reality, and any ideas and practices that leave or transcend reality are wrong and are destined to fail.
    Our Party, government, Communist Youth League, schools, and other various social organizations are strengthening labor education for the broad masses of young students to engage in industrial production, especially agricultural production. Whether the labor education conducted for them can achieve the expected results, that is, whether it can enable the broad masses of young students who cannot enter higher education after graduating from senior elementary school, junior high school, and senior high school, in addition to being able to study on their own and prepare for continuing their studies, to consciously and voluntarily embark on the glorious industrial and agricultural production posts, engage in physical labor, and persevere. This first depends on whether these young students themselves can overcome the various difficulties they may encounter when participating in industrial and agricultural production and engaging in physical labor; at the same time, it also depends on whether the parents of these young students can help their children or younger siblings overcome these difficulties in all aspects.
    The labor education conducted for young students can explain some truths to them through written, oral, or other art forms (such as drama, movies, etc.) to illustrate the necessity and importance of this labor, thereby helping them solve some ideological problems, otherwise they will not know the direction and goals of their efforts. However, it must be emphasized here that knowing this correct direction of struggle and goals of struggle is far from being the same as implementing this correct direction of struggle and achieving these goals of struggle. To get from the former to the latter, it is also necessary to go through a rather arduous and complex road of struggle, and encounter many various difficulties. If these young students themselves cannot overcome the various difficulties they may encounter, thereby victoriously going through this difficult and complex road of struggle, they cannot obtain the final victory of participating in industrial and agricultural production labor, and there is a danger of giving up halfway!
      Then, what kind of difficulties will young students encounter when they start participating in industrial and agricultural production and engaging in physical labor? And how should they struggle to overcome these difficulties? The first difficulty encountered depends on whether they have the determination to endure hardship and labor, and whether they can develop a habit of enduring hardship and labor. This determination and habit are not easy for a young student who is participating in physical labor for the first time. The specific manifestations of so-called enduring hardship and labor are to be able to withstand wind, sun, and rain, to be able to get used to oil, soot, noise, high temperature, odor, underground and other living conditions, and to not be afraid of being tired and sore all over, and not to be afraid of blisters on the hands. Being sore all over and having blisters on the hands is a temporary and inevitable phenomenon for a person who is participating in physical labor for the first time. After a short period of time, this phenomenon will change and disappear, the bitterness will turn into sweetness, our bodies will be trained to be very strong, we will gradually develop a good habit of enduring hardship and labor, and we will learn a lot of production knowledge, technology, and experience that can never be learned from books from the practice process, and we will personally see the fruits of our labor - industrial or agricultural products. Because of this, labor has become a glorious thing praised by everyone. As early as the Anti-Japanese War, young men and women students who went to Yan'an to study enthusiastically responded to the call of the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, bravely participated in the large-scale production movement that was in full swing at that time, and participated in physical labor. In the process of participating in that large-scale production movement, especially in the beginning, everyone had a lot of blisters on their hands. At that time, two doggerel poems were popular in Yan'an: "What is proud, everyone has two blisters on their hands." These two lines of poems specifically and vividly described and praised the scene of young people enthusiastically participating in production labor at that time. When a young student starts participating in physical labor, is tired and sore all over, and has blisters on both hands, he mainly relies on his greatest determination to endure hardship and labor, and must take out the perseverance and tenacious spirit of practicing running five miles and ten miles on the sports field to overcome this difficulty. Never bow to this difficulty and give up halfway. Under this circumstance, we sincerely hope that all parents, like those spectators watching the practice runs of five miles and ten miles on the sports field, not only applaud and congratulate the winners who first reach the finish line, but also applaud and "cheer" for those who use all their strength to insist on running to the finish line. You must not, and should not, "discourage" your children or younger siblings.
    Secondly, it depends on whether these young students themselves have the confidence and courage to fight against various old ideas and habits, and must be able to defeat them and achieve victory. As everyone knows, the emergence of any new thing will encounter resistance and obstruction from old things. Encouraging young intellectuals to participate in physical labor is a new thing that has emerged under our socialist system. This situation not only proves that our Party and government attach importance to physical labor, making our workers and peasants new workers and new peasants with culture and knowledge, but also proves that the number of young students has greatly increased under the system of people's democratic dictatorship. Then, what are the old things that hinder and destroy such a new thing as the participation of young intellectuals in industrial and agricultural production promoted by our Party and government? That is the general old ideas and habits of despising physical labor, especially despising intellectuals' participation in physical labor. This old idea and habit often consciously or unconsciously attacks this new thing from all corners and aspects of society. Especially when this new thing encounters difficulties and setbacks in the process of development, they gloat and even unite to besiege this new thing. Some young intellectuals with less firm will often fail to persist in the face of this old idea and habit besieging them in various forms (such as relatives, friends, fellow villagers, classmates, etc.) from various aspects, and are disarmed ideologically: they become prisoners of the old idea and habit of despising physical labor! It can be seen that young intellectuals engaging in industrial and agricultural production is a great cause of building socialism, and it is a great move to change customs. I still remember that during the Anti-Japanese War, in the large-scale production movement carried out in Yan'an, many college students, after work or study, carried manure baskets to pick up manure everywhere. College students picking up manure were not ashamed, but proud. Isn't this a great move to change customs? In the struggle against this old idea and habit, to achieve victory, the first and main thing is to rely on these enlightened young students who have already embarked on the right path, who have a strong will to defend new things and oppose old things, and have the confidence to win, and never succumb to this old idea and habit. As long as we ourselves have a strong will to defend new things and the confidence to win, those old ideas and old habits can definitely be defeated. At the same time, it is also hoped that all parents, when your children or younger siblings are fighting against old things to defend new things, you should give them support and encouragement in all aspects, and you must not stand by and watch, let alone "pour cold water" on them. In this regard, it is a pity that many parents not only do not give their children or younger siblings support and encouragement in all aspects, but also intentionally or unintentionally, directly or indirectly, give them stimulation and blows with cold words. This kind of thinking and practice is of course very wrong.
    As everyone knows, the great victory against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism that we have already obtained was not naturally dropped from the sky, nor was it naturally grown from the ground, but was exchanged by countless people with lofty ideals, heroes and martyrs with their own hot blood and heads; similarly, the happy life of socialism and communism that we will obtain in the future is not grown up relying on the nourishment and irrigation of natural rainwater, but is grown up relying on the sweat shed by countless workers, peasants, and intellectuals in hard work. If we were afraid of bloodshed in the past, we would not have today's great victory against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism; similarly, if we are afraid of sweating today, we will never have tomorrow's happy life of socialism and communism.
    The struggle against right-wing elements is being carried out on a grand scale throughout the country, and the people of the whole country are passing the socialist test. For the broad masses of young people, especially intellectual youth, consciously and voluntarily participating in the physical labor of industrial and agricultural production is an extremely important test of whether they can successfully pass this socialist test.
    Young student comrades, if you cannot continue your studies after graduation, you must consciously and voluntarily bravely throw yourself into industrial, first of all, agricultural production, to exercise yourself, test yourself, and improve yourself; all parents should give support and encouragement in all aspects to their children or younger siblings who have already embarked on and are adhering to this bright and correct road, so that they can obtain the final victory and become a new force with culture in our worker-peasant ranks. The future of the country's construction of socialism and the future of everyone are closely linked to this sweating physical labor of developing industrial and agricultural production.
    The model of this labor education and labor practice is what Comrade Mao Zedong said in his article "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People": "Our education policy should enable the educated to develop in all aspects of moral, intellectual, and physical education, and become cultured laborers with socialist consciousness. We must advocate building the country with diligence and thrift, and we must make all young people understand that our country is still a very poor country, and it is impossible to fundamentally change this state in a short period of time. We must rely on the youth and all the people to unite and fight for decades to create a prosperous and strong country with our own hands. The establishment of the socialist system has opened up a road for us to reach the ideal realm, and the realization of the ideal realm still depends on our hard work. Some young people think that everything should be good when they reach socialism, and they can enjoy a ready-made happy life without effort. This is an unrealistic idea."
    All young comrades, let us work hard according to the road indicated to us by Comrade Mao Zedong! "The more beautiful future of the motherland is right in front of us."

    劳动教育和劳动实践	刘子久
    我们对于青年所进行的各种教育，如学校教育、家庭教育、社会教育，等等，从它的目的性来说，都带有劳动教育的性质。就拿我们的人民解放军对于它的官兵所进行的军事、政治教育来说吧，从表面上来看，它似乎和劳动教育无关，但是它的目的，却不外是：解放或者保护社会的劳动生产力；保卫劳动的场所和劳动的成果。没有一样不和劳动有关。
    对人民进行劳动教育的具体内容是多种多样的，很难一一列举。但是如果把它们的内容或者目的概括一下，大体上可以分为三种：
      第一、是叫他们懂得劳动的意义和作用，使他们自觉地进行劳动，叫他们晓得劳动是光荣的，不劳而食是可耻的，以发挥他们的劳动的积极性。这是在社会主义制度下，对人民，特别是对青年进行
  “德育”的主要的内容和目的。使人民，特别是青年了解爱好劳动和不爱好劳动是判定一个人的品德好坏的主要标志。所以在我们今天所处的社会主义社会里，劳动模范、劳动英雄、先进生产者、先进工作者都成为一种无上光荣的称号。
    第二、是叫他们懂得如何进行劳动的知识和技术，高度地发挥他们的劳动的创造性，使他们能够劳动得又多、又快、又好、又省、又安全。这是在社会主义的制度下，对人民，特别是对青年进行“智育”的主要的内容和目的。劳动的多少、快慢、好坏、节省或者浪费、安全或者不安全，是判定一个人的能力的强弱、知识的高低、经验的丰富与否的主要标志。
    第三、是叫他们锻炼身体，使他们的体质坚强，能够持久地顽强地进行劳动，而不会有心有余（很愿意劳动）而力不足（身体不能支持）的烦闷和痛苦，这就是在社会主义制度下，我们对人民，特别是对青年进行“体育”的主要的内容和目的。
    那么，既然我们对于青年所进行的各种方式的教育都带有劳动教育的性质，为什么还要强调对于青年，特别是对于青年学生进行劳动教育呢？我们现在所强调的这种劳动教育，不是如前面所说的那种广义的劳动教育，而是专指那种直接参加工业和农业生产的体力劳动的劳动教育。为什么我们特别强调对于青年学生进行这种直接参加工业、（包括交通运输、基本建设和其他各种手工业）农业生产的体力劳动的劳动教育呢？这首先，是因为这种直接参加工业、农业生产的体力劳动是人类社会赖以生存、发展和壮大的基础，没有这种劳动，我们就不能获得人类赖以生存和发展所必需的物质资料。所谓“劳动创造世界”的劳动，首先而且主要地是指这种体力劳动。没有这种劳动，连人类的自身的生存都无法持续下去，自然其他一切都无从谈起了。
    其次，是因为人类社会自从有了阶级（有了剥削）以后，就发生所谓“劳心者治人，劳力者治于人”的轻视体力劳动的思想。这种思想，在人们的头脑中有着根深蒂固的影响。而这种轻视体力劳动的思想的实质，就是一种剥削阶级思想。为了打破这种轻视体力劳动的剥削阶级的思想，就必须加强对于直接参加工业、农业生产的体力劳动的劳动教育。使他们晓得所谓劳动光荣的劳动，首先而且主要的是指的这种从事工业、农业生产的体力劳动，这种体力劳动对于国计民生都有着决定的作用。
    再次，是由于我国经济技术发展的落后，目前，甚至在相当长的时期内，这种直接参加工业、农业生产的体力劳动，对于人们来说还是一种谋生的手段，还不能成为人们生活的第一需要。因此，要使人们自觉自愿地去从事这种繁重的劳动生产率又不十分高的体力劳动，就要耐心地、反复地去进行思想政治教育工作，使广大的青年学生了解，要想把目前这种繁重的劳动生产率不高的体力劳动变成为轻松愉快的劳动生产率很高的劳动，需要经过一个长期的艰苦的奋斗过程。没有今天这种繁重的劳动生产率不高的体力劳动，也就没有明天那种轻松愉快的劳动生产率很高的生产劳动和繁荣幸福的生活。须知劳动成为人类生活的第一需要，即使劳动成为轻松愉快的劳动生产率很高的劳动，那是在消灭了人剥削人的制度之后，人类的文化、科学、技术有了高度发展的结果，而任何科学技术的发展没有人类赖以生存的物质资料的生产作基础是不可能的。
  目前我国的科学技术还很落后而人
  口又十分众多，就决定了繁重劳动和简单劳动在目前我国各种生产劳动中的还占有很大的比重。因此，目前我们在学校中对广大青年学生进行劳动教育的时候，必须抓住目前我国人口众多和经济技术发展落后这两个特点，否则就很难对症下药，打通他们的思想。目前我们加强劳动教育的目的就是叫他们自觉自愿地去从事那些还相当繁重的、劳动条件还不够好的、技术比较简单的、劳动生产率也不很高的工业生产和农业生产的体力劳动，并且在这种体力劳动的基础上逐步地减轻它的繁重程度，改善它的劳动条件，进行技术改造，提高劳动生产率。须要知道，这种从事工业、农业生产的体力劳动，不但是判定人们的好坏的标志，而且是改变坏人成为好人的一种最有效的手段。
    既然，目前在我国这种繁重的简单的体力劳动是我国的经济技术落后和人口众多的历史条件所造成的，我们的任务就是用尽一切办法来改变这种现实，但是决不能幻想离开这种现实，任何离开或者超越现实的想法和作法都是错误的，都是注定了要失败的。
    我们的党、政府、青年团、学校和其他各种社会团体，正在加强对于广大青年学生进行这种从事工业生产，特别是农业生产的劳动教育。对他们所进行的这种劳动教育能否收到预期的效果，即是否能够使广大的在高小、初中、高中毕业之后不能升学的青年学生，除了能够自学，准备继续升学者以外，都能够自觉自愿地走上光荣的工业、农业生产的岗位，从事体力劳动，并且坚持下去。这首先取决于这些青年学生自己能否克服他们在参加工业、农业生产，进行体力劳动的时候，可能遇到的各种困难；同时，还有赖于这些青年学生的家长能不能从各方面来帮助他们的子女或者弟妹来克服这些困难。
    对于青年学生所进行的劳动教育可以通过文字、口头或者其他的艺术形式（如戏剧、电影等）向他们讲明一些道理，来说明这种劳动的必要性和重要性，从而帮助他们解决一些思想问题，这是十分重要的，否则他们就不晓得自己应该努力的方向和奋斗目标。但是，在这里必须着重指出，知道这种正确的奋斗方向和奋斗目标，和贯彻执行这种正确的奋斗方向并且达到这种奋斗目标，还远不是一回事情。要由前者到达或者变成后者，还需要经过一段相当艰苦而又复杂的斗争路程，还会遇到许多各种各样的困难。如果这些青年学生自己不能够克服可能遇到的各种困难，从而胜利地走过这段艰难而又复杂的斗争路程，他们就不能获得参加工业、农业生产劳动的最后胜利，就有半途而废的危险！
      那么，青年学生在开始参加工业、农业生产，进行体力劳动的时候，会遇到些什么样的困难？并且要怎样进行斗争来克服这些困难呢？首先要遇到的一个困难，就看他们自己有没有吃苦耐劳的劳动决心，能不能养成一种吃苦耐劳的劳动习惯？这种决心和习惯，对于一个初次参加体力劳动的青年学生来说，并不是一件很容易作到的事情。所谓吃苦耐劳的具体表现，就是要受得起风吹、日晒和雨淋，要能够过惯油垢、烟尘、噪音、高温、臭气、地下等生活，更要不怕累得浑身酸痛，不怕手上磨起血泡。浑身酸痛，手上起血泡，是一个初次参加体力劳动的人的一种暂时的必然的现象，经过一个短时期之后，这种现象就会改变、消失，就会苦过甘来，就会把我们自己的身体锻炼得很坚强，就会逐渐养成一种吃苦耐劳的好习惯，就会从实践过程中学得许多在书本上绝对不能学到的生产知识、技术和经验，就会亲眼看到自己的劳动成果——工业或者农业的产品。正因为这样，劳动才成为人人称道的光荣事情。早在抗日战争时期，到延安求学的男女青年学生，当时都热烈地响应了党和毛泽东同志的号召，勇敢地参加了当时闹得热火朝天的大生产运动，参加了体力劳动。在参加那种大生产运动的过程中，特别是在开始的时候，每个人的手上都曾磨起了不少血泡。当时在延安流行的两句打油诗：“何事可骄傲，每人两手泡”。这两句诗具体而且生动地描述和歌颂了当时青年热烈参加生产劳动的情景。当着一个青年学生开始参加体力劳动，累得浑身酸痛，两只手起了血泡的时候，主要是依靠自己有吃苦耐劳的最大决心，并且要拿出在运动场上练习跑五英里、十英里的那种毅力和顽强精神来克服这种困难。决不在这种困难面前低头，半途而废。在这种情况之下，我们诚恳地希望各位当家长的，也要像在运动场上那些观看练习跑五英里、十英里的观众一样，不仅给那些首先跑到了终点的优胜者鼓掌、祝贺，而且更要给那些用尽一切气力，坚持要跑到终点的人们鼓掌、“加油”，决不能够，也不应该给自己的子女或者弟妹“泄气”。
    其次，要看这些青年学生自己有没有同各种旧思想和习惯势力作斗争，并且一定能够战胜它们，取得胜利的信心和勇气。大家知道，任何一种新事物的出现，都会遇到旧事物的抵抗和阻挠。鼓励青年知识分子参加体力劳动，这是在我们的社会主义制度下出现的一种新事物。这种情况，不仅证明我们的党和政府重视体力劳动，使我们的工人和农民都成为有文化、有知识的新的工人和新的农民，而且证明在人民民主专政制度下，青年学生的数字有了很大的增加。那么，对于我们的党和政府所提倡的青年知识分子参加工业、农业生产的这样一个新事情，进行阻挠和破坏的旧事物是什么呢？那就是一般的轻视体力劳动，特别是轻视知识分子参加体力劳动的旧思想和习惯势力。这种旧思想和习惯势力，常常自觉地或不自觉地从社会的各个角落和各个方面来向这种新事物进攻。特别是当着这种新事物在发展过程中，遇到困难，受到挫折的时候，它们就幸灾乐祸，甚至联合起来对这种新事物进行围攻。有些意志不大坚定的青年知识分子，在这种旧思想和习惯势力以各种不同面目（如亲戚、朋友、同乡、同学等）从各个方面，以各种形式轮番地围攻面前，往往就不能坚持下去，在思想上被他们解除武装：成了那种轻视体力  劳动的旧思想和习惯势力的俘虏！可见，青年知识分子从事参加工业、农业生产是一种建设社会主义的伟业，是一种移风易俗的壮举。我还记得在抗日战争时期，在延安开展的大生产运动中，有许多大学生，在工作或者学习之余，就背起粪筐到处去拣大粪。大学生拣大粪，不以为耻，反以为荣，这不是移风易俗的壮举是什么呢？在同这种旧的思想和习惯势力的斗争中，要想取得胜利，首先而且主要的是依靠这些觉悟了的并且已开始走上了正确道路的青年学生自己，有着卫护新事物和反对旧事物的坚强的斗志和胜利的信心，决不为这种旧思想和习惯势力所屈服。只要我们自己有着卫护新事物的坚强的斗志和胜利的信心，那些旧思想和旧习惯势力是一定可以战胜的。同时，也希望各位家长，当你们的子、女或者弟、妹正在为了卫护新事物而和旧事物作斗争的时候，你们要从各个方面给他们以支持和鼓励，决不能袖手旁观，更不该给他们“泼冷水”。在这一方面，可惜的是，竟有不少家长不但不从各方面给他们的子、女或者弟、妹以支持和鼓励，而且是有意无意地、直接间接地、冷言冷语地给他们以刺激和打击，这种思想和作法当然是十分错误的。
    大家知道，我们现在已经得到的反对帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的伟大胜利，不是自然而然从天上掉下来的，也不是自然而然地从地里生长出来的，而是多少年来，无数志士仁人、英雄先烈用他们自己热血和头颅换来的；同样，我们将来要获得的社会主义和共产主义的幸福生活，也不是依靠天然雨水的滋润、灌溉生长出来的，而是依靠无数工人、农民和知识分子在辛勤劳动中所流出的汗水的滋润灌溉中成长起来的。如果，我们过去怕流血，我们就不会有今天的反对帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的伟大胜利，同样，如果，我们今天怕流汗，我们也决不会有明天的社会主义和共产主义的幸福的生活。
    反对右派分子的斗争正在全国范围内波澜壮阔地进行着，全国人民正在过社会主义这一关。对于广大青年、特别是知识青年来说，自觉自愿地参加工业、农业生产的体力劳动，是他们能否胜利地过社会主义这一关的一个极为重要的考验。
    青年学生同志们，如果你们在毕业以后，不可能继续升学的时候，就要自觉自愿地勇敢地投入工业，首先是农业生产中去，去锻炼自己，考验自己，提高自己；各位家长们要从各个方面给那些已经或者正在走上并且坚持这条光明而正确大道的自己的子女或者弟、妹以支持和鼓励，使他们获得最后的胜利，成为我们工农队伍中有文化的新生力量。国家建设社会主义的前途和每一个人的前途，都和这种发展工业、农业生产的流汗的体力劳动紧密地联系着。
    这种劳动教育和劳动实践的典范，就是毛泽东同志在“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”一文中所说的：“我们教育的方针应该使受教育者在德育、知育、体育几方面都得到发展，成为有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者。要提倡勤俭建国，要使全体青年们懂得，我们的国家现在还是一个很穷的国家，并且不可能在短时间内根本改变这种状态，全靠青年和全体人民在几十年时间内，团结奋斗，用自己的双手创造出一个富强的国家。社会主义制度的建立给我们开辟了一条到达理想境界的道路，而理想境界的实现还要靠我们的辛勤劳动。有些青年人以为到了社会主义就应当什么都好了，就可以不费气力享受现成的幸福生活了。这是一种不实际的想法。”
    全体青年同志们，让我们按照毛泽东同志指示给我们的道路努力前进吧！“祖国的更加美好的将来，正摆在我们的前面。”
