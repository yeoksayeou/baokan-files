    Should Be Treated Separately
    In the Fifth Division of the Installation Company of the Third Construction District directly under the Beijing Construction Engineering Bureau, there are twenty female cadres. In this round of streamlining and transferring cadres, only one typist and one on-site recorder were retained in the office. The remaining eighteen female cadres are all being mobilized to retire and return home, and the mobilization methods are very rigid. For example, personnel cadre Dai Wenbin mobilized Ma Shuhua, a draftsman in the construction section, to return home, saying: Where do you want to go? Ma said: I will follow the organization's assignment and do whatever is assigned. Dai said: What if the organization assigns you to return home? Ma said: I am only nineteen years old this year, and I live in Shanghai. My mother and grandmother take care of the housework. What would I do if I went home? She expressed her firm unwillingness to return home. However, the next day, the division chief of the Fifth Division of the Installation Company, Li Yanlin, went to mobilize her to retire and return home, saying: You grew up in the city. If you go to the countryside, you won't be able to eat cornbread, and if you go to the construction site as a strong laborer, your health won't be able to handle it. Then, Cui Fengtian, the head of the construction section, also talked to her, still mobilizing her to retire and return home.
    If female cadres genuinely lack the qualifications to work in the office, or if housework is very heavy, and working in the office is not as good as returning home to manage housework, of course they can be mobilized to return home to engage in housework. However, the practice of the Fifth Division of the Installation Company of the Third Construction District directly under the Beijing Construction Engineering Bureau, which does not distinguish between specific circumstances, does not make proper arrangements, and wants most of the female cadres to retire and return home, is obviously wrong.

    应该分别对待
    北京市建工局直属三工区安装公司五处，共有二十个妇女干部，这次紧缩机构下放干部中，只有一个打字员和一个现场记录员被留在机关工作，其余十八个女干部全都要被动员退职回家，而且动员时方式非常生硬。如人事干部戴文彬动员施工科描图员马淑华回家时说：你愿意到那儿去呀？马说：听从组织分配，干什么都行。戴说：假如组织上分配你回家你怎么样？马说：我今年才十九岁，家住上海，有妈妈和外婆照管家务，我回家干什么？表示坚决不愿回家。可是隔了一天，该处处长李延林同志又去动员她退职回家，并说：你生长在城市，假若到农村，你吃不惯窝头，下工地当壮工，你身体也不行。接着施工科科长崔丰田又找她谈话，仍然动员她退职回家。
    女干部如果确实缺乏在机关工作的条件，或者家务劳动很繁重，在机关工作不如回家料理家务的话，当然可以动员她们回家从事家务劳动，但是像直属三工区安装公司五处这种不分别具体情况、不作妥善安排而要绝大部分女干部退职回家的做法，显然是错误的。
