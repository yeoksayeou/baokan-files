    County Party Secretary Repairs Toilet
    I was walking home from the office when I saw two people in uniform ahead of me. One was carrying a saw, and the other had three planks of wood on his shoulder. I thought they must be carpenters returning from work. Suddenly, the person with the saw turned sideways to speak, and I was surprised to see that it was Comrade Dong Zhanbiao, the County Party Secretary. I asked, "Secretary Dong, what are you doing?" The person carrying the planks chimed in, "The toilet boards are rotten, and we're going to repair the toilet." The person who answered was Comrade Gao Tiankui, the Secretary of the County Discipline Inspection Committee.

    县委书记修厕所
    我从机关回家，前面有两个穿着制服的人。一个手里拿着锯子，一个肩上扛了三块木板，我认为一定是收工回来的木匠。忽然那个拿锯子的人侧转着身说话，我瞪眼一看，原来是县委书记董占标同志。我问：“董书记做什么？”那个扛木板的人抢着搭话：“厕所蹬板烂了，我们去修厕所。”答话的人是党县监委书记高天魁同志。
