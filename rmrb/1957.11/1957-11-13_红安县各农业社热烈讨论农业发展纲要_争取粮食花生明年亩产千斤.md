    Hong'an County Agricultural Cooperatives Enthusiastically Discuss Agricultural Development Program
    Striving for a Grain and Peanut Yield of 1,000 Jin Per Mu Next Year
    (Our Dispatch) After the promulgation of the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft), eighty-one agricultural cooperatives in Hong'an County, Hubei Province, launched enthusiastic discussions and studies. Through study, they overcame conservative thinking, tapped production potential, and revised production plans, demanding to achieve a double 1,000 jin county (grain and peanut yield of 1,000 jin per mu) next year.
    The CCP Hong'an County Committee, in studying the Agricultural Development Program, unanimously agreed that the key to implementing and achieving the program lies first in overcoming right-leaning conservative thinking from top to bottom, further tapping increased production potential, and revising production plans.
    The County Committee analyzed the situation in the past two years: Encouraged by the promulgation of the Forty Articles Program (Draft) last year, the county quickly achieved agricultural collectivization. In these short two years, grain production increased by 84.26 million jin (accounting for 37.65% of the 1955 production), oilseed production increased by 9.5 million jin (accounting for 46.51% of the 1955 production), and pig breeding increased by 91,000 heads (accounting for 90% of 1955). The speed of these two years' increases exceeded the sum of the increase speed of the previous four years. Particularly noteworthy is 1957, where all 732 cooperatives in the county increased production, and all crops achieved bumper harvests. The average grain yield per mu for the year reached more than 834 jin, exceeding the 1962 production level stipulated by the Hubei Provincial Party Committee and the 1967 level (800 jin) stipulated by the National Agricultural Development Program for areas south of the Bailong River by more than 34 jin. In the county's eight districts and forty-eight townships, three districts and seventeen townships already had an average grain yield of more than 1,000 jin per mu. The county's more than 47,000 mu of peanuts, under severe drought, still achieved a yield of 600 jin per mu, creating the highest record of large-scale high yield in the country.
    Based on the above situation, and after repeated research and discussion, the County Committee believes that Hong'an County, which has obtained continuous increases and bumper harvests of peanuts, still has great potential for increased production, and decided to revise the original plan of 800 jin per mu in 1958 to 1,000 jin per mu. The entire county will achieve a double 1,000 jin county (grain yield of 1,000 jin per mu, peanut yield of 1,000 jin per mu) in 1958. In order to achieve this plan, the County Committee inspected and revised the original plan for large-scale water conservancy projects this winter and spring: the construction of reservoirs was revised from the original plan of thirty-nine to ninety-five, the construction of ponds was increased from two hundred and forty to nine hundred and eighty-five, the construction of weirs and dams was increased from seventy-six to one hundred and twenty-nine, and the repair and expansion of ponds, weirs, and dams was also increased from the original plan of three thousand three hundred and thirty-three to more than nine thousand five hundred. After the completion of this water conservancy plan, the original plan to eliminate drought in the county by 1961 can be achieved as early as 1959.
    Agricultural cooperatives in various places enthusiastically discussed the Agricultural Program, and cadres and members unanimously reflected that "their horizons have broadened, and they have confidence." Liu Youguan, a cadre of the Minzhu Cooperative in Zhaohe Township, said while studying the Program: "In the past, we were like frogs in a well, with only a tiny bit of light. Now we are thinking far ahead, and we have more confidence in our hearts." After further tapping the potential for increased production, this cooperative revised its 1958 production plan: the grain yield per mu was revised from the original plan of 800 jin to 1,000 jin. It also expanded the current winter planting area according to local conditions and increased the unit yield requirements for winter crops. Recently, it also studied specific measures to increase production, such as converting dry land into paddy fields, converting small fields into large fields, converting sloping land into terraced fields, improving soil, converting paddy fields into wheat fields, changing from two harvests a year to three harvests a year, converting wasteland into cultivated land, and improving seeds. It is estimated that just expanding the single-season late japonica rice from 93.8 mu in 1957 to 225 mu can increase grain production by more than 140,000 jin. Currently, these cooperatives are further launching a production upsurge. In the Honghua Cooperative, where winter sowing is about to end, in order to complete the construction plan of forty-one water conservancy projects this winter and spring ahead of schedule, the members are actively preparing tools such as pipes and hoes to welcome the large-scale water conservancy campaign.

    红安县各农业社热烈讨论农业发展纲要
    争取粮食花生明年亩产千斤
    本报讯　全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）公布后，湖北红安县八十一个农业社，展开了热烈的讨论和学习。通过学习，克服保守思想，发掘生产潜力，修订了生产规划，要求在明年实现粮食、花生双千斤县。
    中共红安县委在学习农业发展纲要时，一致认为贯彻和实现纲要的关键，首先在于从上到下的克服右倾保守思想，进一步挖掘增产潜力，修订生产规划。
    县委分析了近两年的情况：在去年四十条纲要（草案）公布的鼓舞下，全县迅速实现了农业合作化。在这短短的两年时间里，粮食增产八千四百二十六万斤（占1955年产量的37．65％），油料增产了九百五十万斤（占1955年产量的46．51％），生猪增加了九万一千头（占1955年的90％）。这两年增产的速度超过前四年增产速度的总和。尤其显著的是1957年，全县七百三十二个社，社社增产，样样作物得到了丰收。粮食全年平均亩产已达八百三十四斤多，超过湖北省委规定的1962年生产水平和全国农业发展纲要规定的1967年白龙江以南地区的水平（八百斤）三十四斤多。全县八个区四十八个乡，已有三个区十七个乡的粮食平均亩产一千斤以上，全县四万七千余亩花生，在严重干旱下，亩产仍达到了六百斤，创造了全国大面积丰产的最高纪录。
    县委根据以上情况，经过反复研究讨论，认为红安县获得连年增产丰收的花生，还有很大的增产潜力，决定由原来1958年亩产八百斤的计划修改为亩产千斤，全县在1958年实现双千斤县（粮食亩产千斤，花生亩产千斤）。为了实现这个规划，县委检查和修订了原来制订的今冬明春大兴水利的计划：兴修水库由原计划的三十九座修改为九十五座，兴修塘由二百四十口增至九百八十五口，兴修堰、坝由七十六处增至一百二十九处，补修和扩建的塘、堰、坝也由原计划的三千三百三十三处增加到九千五百多处。完成这个水利计划后，原来全县到1961年才能消灭旱灾的计划，可提前在1959年实现。
    各地农业社热烈讨论了农业纲要，干部和社员们一致反映：“眼界扩大了，心中有底了”。赵河乡民主社社干刘友贯在学习纲要时说：“我们过去是坐井观天，老鼠眼睛一寸光。这回想远了，心中更有底。”这个社在进一步挖掘增产潜力后，把1958年生产规划作了修订：粮食亩产由原计划的八百斤修改为一千斤，还因地制宜地扩大了当前冬播面积，提高了冬播作物的单位产量要求。最近又研究出改旱地为水田，改小田小地为大田大地，改坡地为梯地，改良土壤，改水田为麦田，改两季收为三季，改荒地为耕地，改良种子等等具体增产措施。据估计，仅将一季晚粳由1957年的九十三点八亩扩大到二百二十五亩，即可增产粮食十四万余斤。目前，这些社正在进一步掀起生产高潮。冬播即将结束的红华社，为了提早完成今冬明春四十一处水利工程的修建计划，社员们都在积极准备管子、挖锄等工具，迎接大兴水利运动。
