This newspaper's Shanghai dispatch on the 4th: In Shanghai, more than a hundred units' rectification movement has entered the first stage, focusing on rectifying work style and improving work. Many units have once again formed a mass upsurge of "speaking out."

Since the rectification movement in the Shanghai Municipal Real Estate Management Bureau shifted to the stage focusing on rectification, the masses have been holding discussions and writing big-character posters to discuss the rectification plan (draft) proposed by the bureau's Party committee. They have also enthusiastically and extensively exposed and criticized certain bureaucratic, subjectivist, and sectarian tendencies in the leadership's work. After repeated analysis and research of these criticisms, the leadership decided to focus on resolving the following issues: overcoming sectarianism and special privileges, strengthening unity between the Party and the masses, correcting the bureaucratic and subjectivist work style of leading cadres who are aloof and detached from reality and the masses, improving and establishing various systems, gradually changing certain unreasonable regulations, and resolving the relationships between higher and lower levels, left and right, internal and external affairs in the process of organizational streamlining and cadre transfer to lower levels. The masses expressed satisfaction with the rectification plan (draft) during the discussion. At the same time, they also criticized that some parts of the plan were not specific enough and actively put forward their own opinions.

In the rectification stage, the Party Committee of Luwan District carefully sorted out and analyzed more than 6,000 opinions raised by the masses. After repeated study, they also clearly proposed to focus on studying and improving the main problems, including sectarianism, special privileges, and the problems of systems and organizational structures, including the setting up of the district committee's working departments, the Party's leadership over the government and the division of Party and government responsibilities, the Party's leadership over the trade union, the Communist Youth League, the Women's Federation, the Party's leadership over the grassroots, and the relationship between the city and the district.

In order to improve the consciousness of leading cadres in the rectification stage, many units have carried out ideological mobilization work and studied the documents of the Third Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. The leaders of the Luwan District Party Committee convened three Standing Committee meetings, four ministerial joint meetings, and conducted many individual talks, organized cadres to earnestly study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's report on the rectification movement and the People's Daily's editorials and reports on rectification issues, conveyed the instructions of the Municipal Party Committee, unified the leading cadres' understanding of rectification, and established a revolutionary attitude towards rectification. In order to continue to implement the mass line in the rectification stage and rely on the masses to improve work, the district committee also carried out ideological mobilization among ordinary cadres. Through discussions on the great significance and gains of the anti-rightist struggle, the fundamental differences between the rightists' attack on the Party and our helping the Party with rectification, etc., the masses further drew a clear line between themselves and the rightists in politics and ideology, eliminated concerns, and helped the leadership with a spirit of high responsibility for the revolutionary cause.

    市房地产管理局机关的整风运动自转入着重整改阶段以后，群众连日采取座谈和大字报的形式讨论该局党委提出的整改规划（草案），并热情地广泛地揭露和批评领导工作上某些官僚主义、主观主义和宗派主义。领导方面对这些批评进行反复分析研究后，确定着重解决以下几个问题：克服宗派主义和特殊化的倾向，加强党群之间的团结，纠正领导干部高高在上，脱离实际脱离群众的官僚主义、主观主义作风，健全和建立各项制度；逐步改变某些不合理的规定；在机构紧缩和干部下放中解决上下左右内外关系；等等。群众在讨论中，对党委提出的整改计划（草案）表示满意。但同时，也批评了计划的某些部分还不够具体，并积极提出了自己的意见。
    中共芦湾区委机关在整改阶段中，认真整理分析了群众提出的六千多条意见，经过反复研究，也都明确提出了要着重研究，改进的主要问题，其中除宗派主义、特殊化倾向等内容外，并研究解决制度和组织机构的问题，包括区委工作部门的设置，党对政府的领导和党政分工，党对工会、共青团、妇联的领导，党对基层的领导，市区关系等问题。
    为了提高领导干部在整改阶段的自觉性，许多单位都进行了思想动员工作，进行了党的三中全会文件的学习。中共芦湾区委领导上召开了三次常委会、四次部长联席会议，并进行了多次的个别交谈，组织干部认真学习邓小平同志关于整风运动的报告和人民日报有关整改问题的社论和报道，传达了市委的指示，统一了领导干部对于整改的认识，树立了对整改的革命态度。为了在整改阶段继续贯彻群众路线，依靠群众改进工作，区委在一般干部中也进行了思想发动，通过座谈反右派斗争的重大意义和收获，右派分子向党进攻和我们帮助党整风的根本区别等等问题，使群众进一步划清和右派分子在政治上、思想上的界限，消除顾虑，以对革命事业高度负责的精神，帮助领导进
