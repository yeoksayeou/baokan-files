Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 22nd: According to TASS, Soviet scientists' experiments with artificial satellites have confirmed that the universe is not a vacuum. This was stated by Soviet Doctor of Physical and Mathematical Sciences, Ali Bert, at a discussion meeting of physicists at the Soviet Academy of Sciences. He said that the universe is filled with matter of relatively high density: according to preliminary calculations, each cubic centimeter contains thousands of gas particles.

Ali Bert went on to say that now, not only is it possible to create substantive hypotheses about the nature of the universe, but also to verify them experimentally. In order to carry out this work, Soviet scientists adopted new radio measurement methods. Using this method, dense, negatively charged particles—electrons—were discovered at the apogee of the second artificial satellite, at a high altitude of 1,500 to 1,700 kilometers.

It is reasonably speculated that the closer to the sun, the greater the density of interstellar matter. Soviet astrophysicists observed the radio occultation phenomenon of the so-called Crab Nebula (an extremely distant and powerful source of radio radiation). It was discovered that the radio occultation appeared long before the sun was located between the nebula and the earth. This is because not only does the sun and its corona (atmosphere) block the radio radiation from the nebula, but the interstellar space near the sun with a high density of matter can also block the path of radiation.

The confirmation of the fact that the density of matter in interstellar space is very high makes it necessary to modify certain astrophysical and geophysical hypotheses. In particular, the question of how solar corpuscular radiation of relatively low density and low speed (about 1,500 to 2,000 kilometers per second) can penetrate such a dense medium remains to be solved. It is speculated that because this medium contains a large number of neutral, uncharged particles, the corpuscular radiation stream can pass through. It is possible that this stream of neutral particles, which can penetrate deep into the lower atmosphere (down to 100 kilometers from the ground), is one of the causes of the aurora.

### 人造卫星实验证明  宇宙空间并非真空  离太阳愈近，星际物质密度愈大

    人造卫星实验证明
    宇宙空间并非真空
    离太阳愈近，星际物质密度愈大
    新华社22日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联科学家用人造卫星进行的实验证实，宇宙空间并非真空，这是苏联物理数学博士阿利别尔特在苏联科学院物理学家讨论会上说的。他说，宇宙空间充满了相对说来密度颇大的物质：根据初步计算，每一立方公分内含有数千个气体粒子。
    阿利别尔特接着说，现在，不仅已经可以创立关于宇宙空间性质的实质的假说，并且可以用实验方法来加以验证。为了进行这项工作，苏联科学家采用了新的无线电测量方法。用这种方法在第二个人造卫星的远地点，即在一千五百到一千七百公里高度的高空，发现了密集的带阴电的粒子——电子。
    有根据推测，距太阳愈近，星际物质的密度愈大。苏联天体物理学家对所谓蟹状星云（极远的、强大的无线电辐射源）的无线电食现象进行了观察。发现了：在太阳位于星云和地球之间很久以前无线电食就出现了。这是因为，不仅太阳及其光环（大气层）阻碍星云的无线电辐射，就是太阳附近具有高度物质密度的星际空间也能阻断辐射的道路。
    星际空间物质密度很大这一事实的确定，使得某些天体物理学假说和地球物理学假说有必要加以修改。尤其有待解决的是，密度较小和速度不大（每秒约一千五百到二千公里）的太阳微粒辐射如何穿过密度这样大的介质的问题。人们推想，由于这一介质含有大量中性的不带电粒子，因而微粒辐射流能够通过。可能这种能够深入大气低层（深入到距地面一百公里）的中性粒子流，正是极光产生的原因之一。
