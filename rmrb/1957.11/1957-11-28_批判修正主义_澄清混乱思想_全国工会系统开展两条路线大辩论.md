Criticize Revisionism, Clarify Confused Thinking
National Trade Union System Launches Two-Line Debate

(Our newspaper report) A broad debate on the two lines of trade union work is underway within China's trade union system. Erroneous opinions about trade union work that emerged during the initial stage of the rectification campaign, when people were encouraged to speak out freely, are being systematically criticized, and the confused thinking of trade union cadres regarding the fundamental principles and tasks of trade unions is being clarified.

Shortly after the start of the rectification movement, many newspapers published a newsletter written by Xinhua News Agency reporter Li Feng after interviewing Li Xiuren, deputy director of the General Office of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, entitled "Eight Thousand Miles of 'A Quick Glance at the Flowers'." Although this newsletter touched on several important basic ideas of current trade union work, it gave a one-sided, negative reflection and erroneous analysis and conclusion about the status quo of trade union work, arguing that the trade union was "losing the masses" and encountering a "crisis" because it "spoke with one voice" with the administration. The publication of this newsletter at the beginning of the rectification movement stimulated the thinking of many trade union workers, and they actively explored the problems in current trade union work in the process of speaking out freely and contributing to trade union publications.

The discussion revealed fundamental differences in the opinions of trade union cadres on trade union work. This divergence was concentrated on three main issues: the issue of opposing economism and syndicalism within the trade union system after 1951, the issue of evaluating trade union work since the Seventh National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions, and the issue of the main problems in current trade union work. The majority of trade union cadres held correct opinions on these issues, while a minority held incorrect opinions. Those with incorrect opinions believed that China did not have the social basis for generating economism and syndicalism, and therefore it was wrong to oppose economism and syndicalism within the trade union; they believed that the role of trade unions under the dictatorship of the proletariat was "protection," and protecting the immediate interests of workers was the unique role of trade unions, the personality of trade unions. Therefore, the guiding principle and task of trade unions should not be production-centered, integrating production, life, and education, but should be revised to only manage life or focus on life; they believed that trade union work had been declining since the "Seventh National Congress" because the guiding principles and tasks were unclear and because economism and syndicalism had been opposed in previous years; they believed that the main problems in current trade union work were that the Party and the administration did not support the trade union and the trade union was unable to support the demands of the masses, therefore, they demanded expanding the rights of the trade union, demanding that the Party interfere less with the trade union, and allowing the trade union to play a "unique role." These fundamentally incorrect opinions had a bad influence on some wavering trade union cadres, causing them to be shaken by ideological ambiguity.

In order to clarify the ideological confusion among trade union cadres, the Party Group of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions convened an enlarged meeting from September 5th to September 15th to discuss the divergent opinions on the three main issues in current trade union work, clarify thinking among the leading trade union members, unify understanding, and reach a unanimous conclusion. The Party Group's enlarged meeting believed that the main tasks of trade unions under the people's democratic dictatorship should be production, life, and education, not just one of them, the role of trade union organizations is multifaceted rather than singular, the principles and tasks stipulated by the Seventh National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions are correct, and the steps taken to implement these principles and tasks are basically steady, and the achievements in the work are fundamental and main. The shortcomings and errors in the work are shortcomings and errors in the implementation process, which are secondary compared to the achievements. Some are even unavoidable. The meeting emphasized that the achievements in trade union work are inseparable from the leadership of the Party, the support of the administration, the efforts of the broad masses of workers, and all trade union cadres. Based on the spirit of the enlarged meeting of the Party Group of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, a broad debate has been initially launched among trade union cadres in some areas in the past month or so, and systematic criticism of various revisionist or erroneous statements on trade union issues has begun.

In the process of launching the great debate on trade union issues, the Workers' Daily has published many editorials, articles, news, and newsletters in recent months, refuting revisionist trade union theories and various erroneous opinions from both theoretical and practical perspectives, clarifying the importance of adhering to the correct line of the trade union movement, and expounding on some basic trade union issues from a positive perspective. On October 22nd, the Workers' Daily published an editorial entitled "Adhere to the Correct Line of the Trade Union Movement," which argued that under the current conditions in our country, the erroneous ideological tendencies of the trade union movement are mainly manifested in three issues, namely: the issue of trade unions accepting the leadership of the Party, the relationship between trade unions and the administration, and the relationship between trade unions and the masses. It is necessary to draw a clear line between correct and incorrect thinking on these three issues. The editorial believes that thanks to the correct leadership of the Party, the erroneous ideological tendencies on trade union issues have not formed a complete and systematic line nationwide, but are only the problems of a few trade union cadres, but the serious nature of this error must not be underestimated, otherwise it will have a negative effect. Therefore, "distinguishing right from wrong, clarifying thinking, adhering to the correct line of the trade union movement, and opposing various erroneous ideological tendencies are serious tasks for our country's trade unions on the ideological and political fronts."

Regarding the article "Eight Thousand Miles of 'A Quick Glance at the Flowers'" and the disputes it caused, the editorial department of the Workers' Daily published a commentary on October 24th entitled "Enhance Unity, Educate the Masses." The commentary pointed out that the relationship between trade unions and the masses is generally good, and trade unions have done a lot of work on some major issues and have made great achievements, and have prestige among the majority of the masses. The commentary pointed out that when handling the contradictions between the workers and the enterprise administration within the enterprise, trade unions should adopt an analytical attitude, and should not unilaterally and indiscriminately blame the administration for bureaucracy and not supporting the opinions of the masses, nor should they unilaterally and indiscriminately support all the demands of the workers. Work should be done well from the desire for unity; the masses should be contacted from the perspective of raising the level of awareness of the masses.

Currently, the great debate on the two lines of the trade union movement is gradually unfolding in many places.

### 批判修正主义　澄清混乱思想  全国工会系统开展两条路线大辩论

    批判修正主义　澄清混乱思想
    全国工会系统开展两条路线大辩论
    本报讯　我国工会系统内正在广泛开展关于工会工作的两条路线的大辩论。整风初期大鸣大放中出现的关于工会工作的错误言论正在受到系统的批判，工会干部在工会根本方针、任务方面的混乱思想正在澄清。
    整风运动开始不久，许多报纸发表了新华社记者李峰采访全国总工会办公厅副主任李修仁以后所写的通讯“八千里‘走马观花’记”，这篇通讯虽然涉及了当前工会工作的几个重要的基本思想，但却对工会工作的现状作了片面的消极的反映和错误的分析与论断，认为工会由于同行政“一个鼻孔出气”，已经“失去了群众”，遇到了“危机”。这篇通讯在整风初期发表，引起了许多工会工作者的思想活跃，他们在大鸣大放当中、在向工会报刊投稿中，主动地探讨当前工会工作中的问题。
    讨论中反映出工会干部对于工会工作的意见有着根本的分歧，这种分歧集中在三个主要问题上，这就是：关于1951年以后在工会系统内反对经济主义、反对工团主义的问题，关于中国工会第七次全国代表大会以来工会工作的估价问题和关于当前工会工作中的主要问题。多数的工会干部在这些问题上的意见是正确的，少数人的意见是错误的。持错误意见的人认为中国没有产生经济主义和工团主义的社会基础，因而在工会内部反对经济主义和工团主义是错误的；他们认为工会在无产阶级专政条件下的作用是“保护”，保护工人的眼前利益才是工会的独特作用，是工会的个性，因此，工会的方针任务不应当是以生产为中心，生产、生活、教育三位一体，而应当修改为只管生活或者以生活为主；他们认为工会“七大”以来工会工作走着下坡路，就是因为方针任务不明确，因为前几年反了经济主义和工团主义；他们认为当前工会工作的主要问题是党和行政不支持工会，工会无力支持群众的要求，因此，他们要求扩大工会的权利，要求党少管工会，让工会发挥“独特作用”。这些根本错误的意见在一部分不坚定的工会干部中发生了坏的影响，使他们由思想模糊而动摇起来。
    为了澄清工会干部中的思想混乱，中华全国总工会党组在9月5日到9月15日召开了扩大会议，对于在当前工会工作的三个主要问题上面的分歧意见进行了讨论，在工会领导骨干中澄清了思想，统一了认识，作出了一致同意的结论。党组扩大会议认为在人民民主专政下工会的主要任务应当是生产、生活、教育三个，而不只是其中的一个，工会组织的作用是多方面的而不是单一的，中国工会第七次代表大会所规定的方针和任务是正确的，贯彻这条方针和任务所采取的步骤基本上也是稳妥的，工作中的成绩是基本的，主要的。工作中的缺点和错误是执行过程中的缺点和错误，它和成绩比较起来，则是次要的。有些甚至是难免的。会议着重指出：工会工作中的成绩，是和党的领导、行政的支持、广大职工群众和全体工会干部的努力分不开的。根据全国总工会党组扩大会议的精神，近一个多月来，在一些地方的工会干部中间初步展开了广泛的辩论，对于在工会问题上的各种修正主义的或错误的言论开始进行了系统的批判。
    在开展工会问题的大辩论中，工人日报近几个月来发表了许多社论、文章、消息和通讯，从理论和实际两方面批驳修正主义的工会理论和各种错误意见，阐明坚持工会运动的正确路线的重要性，对一些工会基本问题从正面作了阐述。10月22日工人日报发表题为“坚持工会运动的正确路线”的社论，这篇社论认为在我国现时条件下，工会运动的错误思想倾向主要表现在三个问题上，即：工会接受党的领导、工会对行政的关系和工会对群众的关系的问题上，必须在这三个问题上划清正确同错误的思想界限。社论认为由于党的正确的领导，在工会问题上的错误思想倾向没有在全国形成一条完整的、系统的路线，只是少数工会干部的问题，但是绝不可以低估这种错误的严重性质，否则将会发生消极的作用。因此，“明辨是非，澄清思想，坚持工会运动的正确路线，反对各种错误思想倾向，这是当前我国工会在思想战线和政治战线上的一项严重的任务。”
    对于“八千里‘走马观花’记”一文及其引起的争论，工人日报编辑部在10月24日发表了“增强团结，教育群众”的评论。评论指出目前工会同群众的关系从总的方面看是好的，工会在一些主要问题上做了许多工作，有很大的成绩，在大多数群众中是有威望的。评论指出：工会在处理企业内部工人群众同企业行政之间的矛盾的时候，应当采取分析的态度，而不应片面地不加区别地一概责怪行政有官僚主义、不支持群众意见，也不应片面地不加区别地支持职工群众的一切要求。应当从团结的愿望出发，把工作做好；从提高群众的觉悟水平出发，来联系群众。
    现在，关于工会运动的两条路线的大辩论正在许多地方逐步展开。
