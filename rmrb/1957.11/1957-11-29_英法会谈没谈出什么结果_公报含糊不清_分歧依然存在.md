Xinhua News Agency, Paris, November 27th: The Anglo-French summit talks concluded on the afternoon of the 26th. A tired and pale Macmillan emerged from the French Prime Minister's office and told the assembled reporters that the talks had not reached an agreement, although "great progress" had been made. He also said: "Of course, there will be many problems in the future." Afterwards, he parted coolly with an expressionless Gaillard. That afternoon, Macmillan hurried back to London.

The joint communiqué issued shortly after the talks, while repeatedly emphasizing a "spirit of unity," also indicated that differences between Britain and France remained after the talks.

This is especially evident in the issue of the US-UK arms supply to Tunisia, which caused outrage in France. Observers believe that, in this regard, the attitudes of both sides "have not changed." When the communiqué addressed this issue, it merely stated that the two sides had decided to make some arrangements to avoid a recurrence of difficulties similar to those that had recently occurred. However, when reporters asked the British spokesperson whether this meant that Britain had agreed not to ship weapons to Tunisia, the spokesperson replied, "No." The communiqué also stated that Britain and France would continue to consult on the issue of arms shipments in the future.

Regarding preparations for the NATO summit in December, the communiqué indicated that Britain was trying to quell French indignation caused by the US-UK attempt to subordinate their allies. In this regard, the communiqué only vaguely discussed the need to give a "more precise definition" to the "principle of mutual dependence" and the "unity" of NATO in accordance with the "spirit of equality," and to "strive to develop" the "consultation system" within the group, without any concrete agreement.

    英法会谈没谈出什么结果
    公报含糊不清　分歧依然存在
    据新华社27日讯　巴黎消息：英法两国政府首脑会谈已经在26日午后结束。疲倦而苍白的麦克米伦走出法国总理府，向围拢来的记者表示，会谈没有达成协议，虽然获得了“很大进展”。他还说：“今后当然还会有很多问题。”随后，他同毫无表情的盖伊阿冷淡地分手。当天下午，麦克米伦就匆匆赶回伦敦去了。
    会谈结束后不久发表的联合公报虽然一再强调“团结一致的精神”，但是它也表明英法在会谈后分歧依然存在。
    这尤其是表现在引起法国震怒的美英以武器供应突尼斯的问题上。观察家认为，在这方面，双方的态度“都没有改变”。公报谈到这个问题的时候只是说，双方决定作一些安排，来避免再发生类似最近曾经发生的困难。但是，当记者追问英国发言人，这是否表示英国已经答应不再运武器给突尼斯时，这个发言人回答说：“不。”公报还说，英法今后还要就运送武器问题进行协商。
    在谈到为12月举行的北大西洋集团政府首脑会议作准备的问题时，公报表明，英国竭力想平息法国由于美英企图使它们的盟国处于从属地位而引起的愤慨。在这方面，公报也只是泛泛地谈到要根据“平等精神”对“互相依赖的原则”和北大西洋集团的“团结”下一个“更精确的定义”，谈到要“尽力发展”这个集团中的“协商制度”，而没有什么具体协议。
