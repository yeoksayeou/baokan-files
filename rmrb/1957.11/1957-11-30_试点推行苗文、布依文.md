    Pilot Implementation of Miao and Bouyei Languages
    Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, 29th. Initial success has been achieved in the pilot implementation of the Miao and Bouyei languages in Guizhou Province. More than 200 ethnic minority students participating in the study can generally read and write after more than two months of learning.
    The first batch of six Miao and Bouyei language pilot sites in Guizhou Province are located in areas such as Lushan, Bijie, and Songtao Miao Autonomous County. Each pilot site has forty to fifty students. (Attached picture)
    The harbinger of an era for 6 million Zhuang people to use their own ethnic script to develop their culture - the first Zhuang language literacy campaign in history is being launched on a large scale in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. Tang Huiyun and Pan Qingluan, Zhuang female student workers at the ethnic printing factory, look through the Zhuang language literacy textbooks with joy during their work breaks.
