Xinhua News Agency, November 26th. Soviet Ambassador Yudin held a banquet at the embassy on the evening of the 26th to celebrate the visit to China of the Soviet delegation led by Andreyev.

Chairman Liu Shaoqi, Premier Zhou Enlai, and President Soong Ching Ling were invited to attend tonight's banquet.

Ambassador Yudin said at the beginning of the banquet that the Soviet delegation led by Andreyev came to China for a friendly visit and traveled to various parts of China, witnessing the Chinese people solemnly celebrating the 40th anniversary of the Great October Revolution and seeing the Chinese people's love for the Soviet Union. The Chinese comrades who went to the Soviet Union to participate in the celebration of the October Revolution also saw the profound friendship of the Soviet people towards the Chinese people. At the meeting of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union celebrating the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution, they saw how warmly the Soviet people and all the guests welcomed the Chinese delegation headed by Comrade Mao Zedong. All this shows that the eternal friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people is unbreakable, and the friendship between China and the Soviet Union is a guarantee of world peace.

Head of Delegation Andreyev then spoke, saying, "At the invitation of the Preparatory Committee of the Chinese People for the Celebration of the 40th Anniversary of the Great October Revolution, the Soviet Union sent our delegation to China to participate in the commemorative activities of the Chinese people celebrating the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution. This celebration was filled with the Chinese people's love and friendship for the Soviet Union. Our delegation, on behalf of all circles in the Soviet Union, expresses its deep gratitude to this committee and its chairman, Comrade Liu Shaoqi."

Andreyev went on to talk about two major events that occurred during the celebration of the October Revolution, saying, "The Soviet Union, the countries of the socialist camp, and the working people of the world celebrated the 40th anniversary of the Great October Revolution. The Soviet state - the Soviet Union - has existed for forty years, and now about one billion people in the world are advancing along the path opened up by the October Revolution. This fact alone shows that socialism has achieved a great victory, and capitalism has suffered a heavy defeat and weakening." "There is no doubt that the fifth decade will be an era of new and greater victories for socialism."

Andreyev said that "another major event in celebrating the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution was the conference of representatives of the Communist Parties of socialist countries and the conference of Communist Parties of various countries held in Moscow. These two conferences showed that the Communist Parties of various countries have a consensus of views on all major issues. Important documents of great international significance were adopted at these two conferences."

Andreyev emphasized, "All this will further consolidate the socialist and peace-defending fronts."

When talking about the delegation's impressions of visiting various parts of China, Andreyev said, "Wherever we went, the first thing we saw was the spiritual and political unity of the Chinese people and their concerted efforts in realizing the socialist transformation of the country. Everywhere, we could see the tenacity and perseverance of the working people in all walks of life in realizing the socialist transformation. Everywhere we went, we saw and felt the people's great trust in the Chinese Communist Party and the party's prestige among the people. Everywhere we could see the party's leading role in all undertakings. There is no doubt that the experience of the rectification movement and the anti-rightist struggle led by the Chinese Communist Party is of international significance for the Communist Parties of all countries."

In her speech, President Soong Ching Ling expressed her reluctance to part with the Soviet delegation, saying, "We thank Comrade Andreyev, who, not long after the establishment of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, immediately accepted the invitation to come to our country to participate in the commemorative activities of our people celebrating the 40th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution. The profound speeches he delivered in various parts of our country greatly encouraged our people; at the same time, his visit also promoted the consolidation and strengthening of the ties between the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and the Soviet-China Friendship Association. We thank all the members of the delegation who brought us the infinitely precious friendship of the Soviet people and made great contributions to consolidating the friendship between our two great nations."

Finally, Soong Ching Ling asked all the comrades of the delegation to convey the most sincere and warmest friendship and heartfelt greetings of the Chinese people to the Soviet people.

At the banquet, the guests frequently raised their glasses, wishing for the continuous development and consolidation of the unbreakable great friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people, wishing for the health of the leaders of the Communist Parties and governments of the Soviet Union and China, and wishing for the victory of the construction of communism and socialism in the Soviet Union and China.

Also invited to attend today's banquet were Vice-Chairmen Li Jishen, Shen Junru, and Huang Yanpei, Vice-Premiers Deng Xiaoping, He Long, Chen Yi, and Nie Rongzhen, Vice-Chairman of the National Defense Council Zhang Zhizhong, Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhang Wentian, Vice-Presidents of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Wu Yuzhang, Liao Chengzhi, Ma Yinchu, Shao Lizi, and members of the council, as well as people from all walks of life in the capital.

    尤金大使为苏各界代表团举行宴会
    刘少奇委员长周恩来总理宋庆龄会长应邀出席
    新华社26日讯　苏联驻华大使龙金为以安德烈耶夫为首的苏联各界代表团的访问中国，在26日晚间在大使馆举行宴会。
    刘少奇委员长、周恩来总理和宋庆龄会长应邀出席了今晚的宴会。
    尤金大使在宴会开始时讲话说，以安德烈耶夫为首的苏联各界代表团来到中国进行友好访问和到中国各地作了旅行，亲眼看到中国人民隆重地庆祝伟大的十月革命四十周年，看到中国人民对苏联的热爱。到苏联去参加十月革命庆祝典礼的中国同志们，也看到了苏联人民对中国人民的深厚的友情，在苏联最高苏维埃庆祝十月革命四十周年的大会上，看到了苏联人民和所有的来宾是如何热烈地欢迎以毛泽东同志为首的中国代表团。这些都表明了中苏两国人民之间的永恒友谊是牢不可破的，而中苏两国友好就是世界和平的保证。
    安德烈耶夫团长接着讲话，他说，“应中国人民庆祝伟大十月革命四十周年筹备委员会的邀请，苏联派出了我们这个代表团来中国参加中国人民庆祝十月革命四十周年的纪念活动，这个庆祝活动洋溢着中国人民对苏联的热爱和友情。我们代表团谨代表苏联各界向这个委员会和它的主任委员刘少奇同志表示深深的谢意。”
    安德烈耶夫接着谈到在庆祝十月革命节期间发生的两桩重大事件，他说，“苏联，社会主义阵营的各个国家以及全世界劳动人民一道庆祝了伟大十月革命四十周年这个伟大的节日。苏维埃国家——苏联已经存在了四十年，现在世界上约有十亿人口沿着十月革命所开辟的道路前进，这个事实本身就说明社会主义取得了伟大的胜利，资本主义遭到了沉重的失败和削弱。”“毫无疑问，第五个十年将是社会主义取得新的更大的胜利的年代。”
    安德烈耶夫说，在“庆祝十月革命四十周年的另一重大事件，这就是在莫斯科举行的社会主义国家共产党代表会议和世界各国共产党会议。这两个会议表明了各国共产党在一切主要问题上观点是一致的。在这两个会议上通过了具有重大国际意义的重要文件。”
    安德烈耶夫强调指出，“这一切都将使社会主义和保卫和平的阵线更加巩固。”
    安德烈耶夫在谈到代表团访问中国各地的印象时说，“无论走到那里，我们首先看到的是中国人民在精神上和政治上的团结一致和在实现国家社会主义改造时所表现的同心同德。到处都可以看到各行各业的劳动人民为了实现社会主义改造所表现的坚韧顽强精神。我们每到一地都看到和感觉到人民对中国共产党的巨大信任以及党在人民中的威信。到处都能看到党对一切事业的领导作用。毫无疑问，中国共产党领导的整风运动和反右派斗争的经验对于各国共产党都是具有国际意义的。”
    宋庆龄会长在讲话中对苏联各界代表团表示惜别，她说，“我们感谢安德烈耶夫同志，在苏中友好协会成立不久，立即应邀来我国参加我国人民庆祝伟大十月社会主义革命四十周年的纪念活动。他在我国各地所发表的意义深刻的讲话，给了我国人民以很大的鼓舞；同时，他的这次访问，也促进了中苏友好协会和苏中友好协会之间连系的巩固与加强。我们感谢代表团的全体团员同志们，他们给我们带来了苏联人民无限珍贵的友情，他们在巩固我们两大民族之间的友谊方面，作出了巨大的贡献。”
    宋庆龄最后请代表团的全体同志们把中国人民对于苏联人民的最真挚最热烈的友情和衷心的问候，转达给苏联人民。
    在宴会上，宾主们频频举杯，祝中苏两国人民牢不可破的伟大友谊不断发展和巩固，祝苏中两国共产党和政府领导同志的健康，祝苏中两国共产主义和社会主义建设的胜利。
    应邀出席今天宴会的，还有李济深、沈钧儒、黄炎培副委员长，邓小平、贺龙、陈毅、聂荣臻副总理，国防委员会副主席张治中，外交部副部长张闻天，中苏友好协会总会副会长吴玉章、廖承志、马寅初、邵力子和理事们，以及首都各界人士。
