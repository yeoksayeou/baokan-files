What I Brought Back From Hong'an County…
    —Deputy Secretary of the CPC Pingjiang County Committee Discusses His Impressions of Visiting Hong'an County
    By Our Correspondent Huang Yubai

“This visit to Hong’an County not only resolved my ideological problems but also taught me excellent working methods. If Hong’an County can do it, we can definitely do it too.” The speaker was Li Shaolian, Deputy Secretary of the CPC Pingjiang County Committee. He had just returned from a visit to Hong’an County in Hubei. As soon as he returned, he excitedly delivered a report to a meeting of over 1,800 cadres. We specifically asked him to share his thoughts.

“After the methods of Hong’an County were introduced in the People's Daily, our County Party Secretary, Comrade Wang Xiaoliang, led the County Committee in discussing for two days how to learn from their experience. To be honest, I originally thought this way: our grain production in Pingjiang has already doubled since liberation. Since cooperativization, we have had three consecutive years of bumper harvests. This year's total grain output is estimated to reach 500 million *jin*, with an average yield of 646 *jin* per *mu*, which is unprecedented in history. Initially, when the County Committee was discussing the production plan for next year, Secretary Wang, based on materials obtained through investigation and research, proposed that the grain production target for next year should reach 550 million *jin*. I still thought this was too high. Although everyone investigated and calculated, putting forward the basis for increased production, I thought that the people were still the same people, and the land was still the same land. It wouldn't be without difficulties to jump over such a big step. I didn't say it outright at the time, but I did have some doubts in my mind.

“My ideological knot was untied when I arrived in Hong’an. The production conditions in Hong’an County are not better than those in Pingjiang; to be honest, they are worse. I visited them for five days, walking from the west to the south. Although the terrain is similar to Pingjiang, their Dabie Mountains are larger than our Mufu Mountains. The climate there is colder than in Pingjiang, the water conservancy conditions are not as convenient as in Pingjiang, and the soil quality is also worse than in Pingjiang. However, their grain yield has reached a standard of 800 *jin* per *mu*. Only then did I realize that the potential of the land is great; the question is whether we ourselves have the determination.

“In the past, we never had a deep understanding of this. Several of us on the County Committee were a bit conservative, and there were even more cadres above the level of Township Party Secretary who were. Eleven Township Party Secretaries went with me to visit Hong’an County this time, and several comrades had doubts. For example, Chen Fude, the Party Secretary of Qingshui Township, said, 'We need to see if Hong'an County is really bragging!' When visiting the An’nan Agricultural Cooperative in Hong’an County, just seeing the on-site situation wasn't enough. Zhang Jiuchou, the Party Secretary of our Nanjiang Township, secretly measured a five-*fen* plot of land to see if their fields were larger than ours. It turned out they weren't. Upon closer inspection, it turned out that their rice was generally four inches and four-tenths tall, with seventeen or eighteen roots per clump, and they applied an average of over 300 *shi* of fertilizer per *mu*, plus they achieved 'five plows, four harrows, and one *chao*', and prevented various natural disasters. The final acceptance showed that this five-*fen* plot alone yielded 874 *jin* of grain, which translates to 1,748 *jin* per *mu*. Our Pingjiang is generally seven inches and seven-tenths tall now. If we densely plant like them, we can increase the number of rice clumps by more than 3,000 per *mu*. In addition, if we do a good job in processing and fertilizing, it is no problem to increase production by 700 *jin* on the existing basis. After such a calculation, our comrades were truly convinced. Once this doubt was eliminated, the enthusiasm naturally came.

“Our Secretary Wang once said that to resolve ideological issues, it is not enough to argue in meetings; it is more important to see the site and see the advanced things of others. One visit is better than holding three County Committee meetings at home. The masses also need this. As long as we find high-yield models in our own hometown and organize them to visit each other, the effect will be very good. Wherever this is done well, the masses' enthusiasm for production will not be 800 *jin* but 1,000 *jin*, or even more.

“As for working methods, our understanding is even deeper. Of the more than 2,000 cadres in Hong’an County, nearly half are stationed in the cooperatives for a long time. Their Minister of Rural Affairs is truly an expert who understands agricultural technology. He answered everything we asked, and he spoke very systematically. The County Party Secretary is also like this. When we shook hands with each other, their hands were also rougher than ours, and their skin was thicker.

“Their method of insisting on running experimental plots is good. Their fields are almost everywhere marked with signs, and everyone from the cooperative cadre to the cooperative member has their own experimental plot. Cadres lead production, not by using their own mouths but by using experimental plots to persuade. This truly combines the leadership with the masses. This is a more specific, more practical, and more effective method of leading production with production. But what about us? In the past, we also emphasized participating in labor and participating in production, and leading production with production. Comrades have, in fact, participated, and one of our alternate County Committee members has already done more than 400 work points this year. We are not afraid of hardship, but the purpose of our participation in labor is not clear. The problem is that we must not only participate in labor but also learn how to labor, so that our labor can produce more grain.

“Now it seems that we used to consider the political significance of labor more, and neglected that we must master technology. Comrades go down to help here and do a little there, and they are tired enough, but the result is that they still don't truly understand how to use production to promote production. When members have technical problems in production to solve, we still can't answer them. The reason is that we ourselves have not accumulated a set of experience from beginning to end, and we have not insisted on running experimental plots.

“This time, it has enlightened us. Since the promulgation of the draft revision of the National Agricultural Development Program, we have held four County Committee meetings and revised the production plan for next year four times. It was not until this latest time that we finalized the plan. Next year, we not only want to reach 550 million, but also 570 million. This time, all the comrades who go to the countryside have made up their minds to run experimental plots, to contract cooperatives, contract experimental plots, contract work and output, and contract year-end settlements. There will be rewards for doing well, and punishments for doing badly. Grain is grown, and to produce more grain, you must have technology. Now the comrades' enthusiasm for studying technology is rising. They said: 'We will learn to understand in one year, master it in two years, and become an expert in three years.'”

Comrade Li Shaolian spoke very excitedly. At the end, he once again expressed his determination: "We must achieve 'ten-year plan, completed in one year.'"

When I left Pingjiang County, a comrade from the County Party Committee Office told me: more than 1,900 cadres in the county have already purchased more than 7,000 pieces of agricultural equipment and have determined nearly 2,000 *mu* of experimental fields. A high tide of studying agricultural technology has arrived together with the high tide of winter production.

    从红安县带回来的……
    ——中共平江县委副书记谈参观红安县的感想	本报记者　黄驭白
    “这次到红安县去参观，不仅解决了我的思想问题，还学到了很好的工作方法。红安县能办到的，我们也一定能办到。”跟我说话的是李少连，中共平江县县委副书记。他是刚从湖北红安县参观回来的。他一回来就兴冲冲地在一千八百多人的干部大会上作了报告，我们特地约了他谈谈感想。
    “红安县的办法在人民日报介绍出来以后，我们县委书记王效良同志就领导县委们讨论了两天，琢磨着如何学习他们的经验。说真的，我原来也是这样想：我们平江的粮食产量比解放前已经提高了一倍。从合作化以来，我们这里连续三年得到丰收，今年的粮食总产量估算可以达到五亿斤，每亩平均产量六百四十六斤，这是历史上从来没有的事情。开始，县委在讨论明年生产规划的时候，王书记根据调查研究得来的材料，提出明年粮食产量指标要达到五亿五千万斤，我还认为这也高了。尽管大家调查算账，提出增产根据，但我想人还是这些人，土地还是这些土地，要跳过这一大步，不是没有困难的。当时我口里没说出，心上的确有些怀疑。
    “到了红安，我的思想疙瘩才解开了。红安县的生产条件并不比平江的好，说实在话是比平江的差。我在他们那里参观了五天，从西边走到南边，地形虽说跟平江差不多，但是他们那里的大别山比我们这里的慕阜山还大。那里的气候比平江冷，水利条件没有平江方便，土质也比平江差，可是，他们的粮食产量，居然每亩达到了八百斤的标准。我这才知道，土地潜力是大的，问题是看我们自己有没有决心。
    “过去我们对这总是体会不深。我们几个县委都是有点保守的，乡党委书记以上的干部就更多了。这次随我一道去红安县参观的就有十一个乡的党委书记，有好几位同志有怀疑。像青水乡党委书记陈福德就说：“到底要去看红安县是不是吹了牛皮！”在红安县安南农业社参观的时候，看了现场情景还不算，我们南江乡的党委书记张九畴还暗地里量了一个五分面积的田，看看是不是他们那里的田面大，结果并不大。再仔细一看，原来他们那里普遍是四寸四的禾，每蔸有十七八根，平均每亩下肥三百石以上，加上做到了“五犁、四耙、一耖”，防治了各种自然灾害，最后验收，单这一丘五分田就收谷八百七十四斤。折成一亩就得一千七百四十八斤。我们平江现在一般是七寸七，如果按照他们那样密植，每亩还可增加三千多蔸禾，另外再搞好加工加肥，在现有基础上增产七百斤不成问题。经过这样一算，我们的同志才真正地服了气，这个怀疑一消除，劲头自然来了。
    “我们王书记曾经说过，要闹通思想，光在会议上争论是不够的，更重要的是去看看现场，看看人家那些先进的东西。看一回，比我们在家里开三回县委会还强。群众也需要这样，只要把本乡本土的高产典型找出来，组织他们互相参观，效果就很好。凡是这样做好了的地方，群众的生产劲头就不会是八百斤，而是一千斤，甚至更多。
    “至于说工作方法，我们的体会就更深了。红安全县两千多个干部，长期驻社的就将近一半，他们的农村部长才真正是懂得农业技术的内行，我们问啥他答啥，开口一套一套的。县委书记也是这样。我们互相握手，他们的手也比我们粗些，皮也比我们厚些。
      “他们那个坚持搞试验田的办法就是好，他们那田里土里，差不多处处都钉了牌子，从社干到社员每人都有自己的试验田。干部领导生产，不是用自己的口而是用试验田去说服的。这才使领导与群众真正结合起来。这是一个更具体、更实际、更有效的以生产领导生产的方法。可我们呢？我们过去也强调参加劳动，参加生产，要以生产领导生产，同志们事实上也参加进去了，我们一个候补县委今年就已做了四百多工分，我们并不怕艰苦，但是我们参加劳动的目的性不明确。问题是不仅要参加劳动，还要学会如何劳动，使我们的劳动会更多地变出粮食来。
    “现在来看，我们过去从劳动的政治意义上考虑的多，忽视了必须掌握技术。同志们下去这里帮帮，那里弄弄，累也够累的，但结果还不是真正懂得生产推动生产，社员们生产上有技术问题要解决，我们还是答不上来，道理就在我们自己没有从头到尾地积累一套经验，没坚持搞试验田。
    “这回算是给我们开了窍了。我们从全国农业发展纲要修正草案公布以后，就开了四次县委会，修订了四次明年的生产计划，到最近这次才订下盘子。计划明年不但要达到五亿五，还要达到五亿七。这回全部下乡的同志，每个人都下了决心要搞试验田，要包社、包试验田、包工包产、包年终决算。包好了有奖，包坏了就罚。粮食是种出来的，要多打粮食就硬要技术。现在同志们钻技术的劲头是起来了。他们说：要一年学懂，两年学通，三年就当个专家。”
    李少连同志说的很激动，临了他还再一次表示决心：我们一定要做到“十年规划，一年完成’。”
    当我离开平江县的时候，县委办公室的同志告诉我：全县已经有一千九百多个干部买了七千多件农具，确定了近两千亩试验田。一个钻研农业技术的高潮伴随着冬季生产的高潮一起到来了。
