Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 3rd: After the rectification campaign in more than 100 units of Shanxi's provincial organs entered its third phase, a surge of "letting a hundred flowers bloom" centered on rectifying work style and improving work has emerged. In many units, the number of big-character posters put up in the first few days of this phase exceeded the total number of big-character posters put up in the previous phase. Many units are also continuing to hold "blooming" discussion meetings. Units that have made faster progress have already begun heated debates centered on issues raised by the masses, such as streamlining institutions and transferring cadres to participate in labor.

Among the opinions that have emerged from various units during this phase of "blooming," there has been a significant increase in opinions on improving the system and streamlining institutions. In the first phase of the rectification campaign in the Provincial Department of Construction, 38% of the opinions concerned issues of livelihood and welfare; this time, such opinions have decreased to 5.6%. Opinions concerning business, systems, institutions, leadership style, etc., which accounted for only 32% last time, have increased to 76% this time. The most frequent opinions are related to improving the existing system, streamlining institutions, and strengthening political and ideological work according to work needs.

    山西省级机关出现鸣放热潮
    有关改进体制紧缩机构的意见显著增加
    据新华社太原3日电　山西省级机关一百多个单位的整风运动转入第三阶段后，已出现了以整顿作风和改进工作为中心内容的鸣放热潮。许多单位在这次鸣放开始头几天，贴出的大字报就达到了前一阶段所贴出的大字报的总和。许多单位的鸣放座谈会也在继续进行。进展较快的单位，已开始以群众提出的有关紧缩机构、抽调干部参加劳动等问题为中心热烈展开了辩论。
    各单位这次鸣放出来的意见中，有关改进体制、紧缩机构等问题的意见显著增加。省建设厅整风第一阶段鸣放出来的意见中38％属于生活福利问题，这次这类意见已下降到5．6％；上次只占32％的有关业务、体制、制度、领导作风等问题的意见，这次上升到了76％。意见最多的是要求根据工作需要改进现有体制、紧缩机构和加强政治思想工作问题。
