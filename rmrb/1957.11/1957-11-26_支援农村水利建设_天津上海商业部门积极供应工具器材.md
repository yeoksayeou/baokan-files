    Supporting Rural Water Conservancy Construction
    Tianjin and Shanghai Commercial Departments Actively Supply Tools and Equipment

    (Our report) Tianjin is actively transferring various materials to support rural water conservancy construction.

    These days, trains and trucks departing from Tianjin, and wooden boats sailing along the Grand Canal and Ziya River, are all loaded with various materials for supplying rural water conservancy projects. These materials will be continuously transported to Hebei, Henan, Heilongjiang, Anhui and other places. The materials include nearly a hundred kinds of items such as diesel engines, water pumps, various types of structural steel, rubber hoses, and lead wire.

    The Tianjin commercial department’s fourth-quarter supply of iron shovels to various rural areas will increase by 50,000 tons compared to the third quarter; various round nails suitable for nailing waterwheels and water dippers, as well as lead wire for well-drilling and pipe-binding, can be increased by more than 2,500 tons; inner tubes for handcarts can be increased by 50,000. A large batch of handcart parts, which are about to be shipped to the Cangxian and Shijiazhuang areas of Hebei Province, can be used to assemble 15,000 handcarts. (Zhang Di)

    (Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 23rd) Shanghai is supplying tools and equipment for small-scale water conservancy projects in rural areas, which are being shipped out in a steady stream. Since the beginning of the fourth quarter, state-owned commercial departments here have shipped out round nails, lead wire, iron shovels, sledgehammers, and handcart parts worth more than 16 million yuan. More than 75% of the above-mentioned commodities supplied in the fourth quarter can be shipped out before the end of November.

    Shanghai originally planned to increase the supply of various water conservancy materials in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter, but various regions still felt it was insufficient. In addition to compressing existing inventories as much as possible, the purchasing and supply stations of the hardware machinery and transportation electrical equipment companies have also taken many measures to actively organize sources of goods and increase supply. In the fourth quarter, a large number of round nails, lead wire, sledgehammers, iron shovels, flexible V-belts for water pumps, and inner and outer tires for handcarts will be supplied to various regions in addition to the original plan. The mud shovels for digging earth, which were not originally planned to be supplied, will also be produced in 7,000 units based on the opinions of various regions.

    支援农村水利建设
    天津上海商业部门积极供应工具器材
    本报讯　天津市积极调运各种器材，支援农村水利建设。
    这些天，从天津开出的火车、汽车，顺运河、子牙河驶出的木船，都装有各种供应农村兴修水利的器材。这些器材将源源不断地运往河北、河南、黑龙江、安徽等地。器材中有柴油机、水泵、各种类型的型钢、胶皮管、铅丝等近百多种。
    天津市商业部门第四季度供应各地农村的铁锨将比第三季度增加五万吨；适于钉制水车、水斗的各种元钉以及打井捆管子用的铅丝可增加二千五百多吨；手推车内胎可增加五万条。最近即将运往河北省沧县和石家庄两专区的大批手推车车辆零件，可以用来装配手推车一万五千辆。　（张谛）
    据新华社上海23日电　上海市供应各地农村兴修小型水利工程的工具器材，正源源运出。进入第四季度以来，这里的国营商业部门已运出价值一千六百多万元的元钉、铅丝、铁锹、鎯头和手推车配件等。第四季度供应的上述商品，75％以上可以在11月底以前运送出去。
    上海原来计划在第四季度供应的各种水利器材，都比第三季度增加，但是各地仍然感到不足。五金机械、交通电工器材公司的采购供应站，除了压缩现有库存尽量供应以外，还采取许多办法积极组织货源，增加供应量。第四季度内将在原计划以外多供应各地大批元钉、铅丝、鎯头、铁锹、抽水机的活络三角带和手推车的内外胎。原来不准备供应的挖土用的泥锹，也根据各地意见决定生产七千把。
