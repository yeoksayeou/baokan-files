    The Story of the "Unity Trough"
    In Xijiadian Township, Jun County, Xiangyang Special District, Hubei Province, there are two agricultural cooperatives, one is the Mingxing No. 1 Cooperative, and the other is the No. 2 Cooperative. The fields of the two cooperatives are very close, separated only by a low-lying path. No. 1 Cooperative is at the foot of the mountain, and the spring water from the mountain flows to the final point of No. 1 Cooperative, which is also the frontmost field of No. 2 Cooperative. Because of the low-lying path, the water no longer flowed forward. Therefore, every year during the busy water use season, the two cooperatives often had disputes over unequal water distribution, which affected unity and production.
    This year, during water conservancy construction, the two cooperatives jointly studied and discussed conquering this low-lying road. They used stones to build several stone piers on the road and built a long wooden trough on the piers. From then on, the spring water no longer favored one over the other, and the two cooperatives no longer had disputes.
    A wooden trough connected their hearts, allowing them to jointly improve production and jointly embark on the road to prosperity. Water conservancy construction united the two agricultural cooperatives. The right picture is the "Unity Trough."

    “团结水槽”的故事
    在湖北省襄阳专区均县习家店乡有两个农业社，一个是明星一社，另一个是二社。两个社的田地相隔很近，中间只隔一条低凹的小路。一社在山脚下，山上的泉水流到一社最终点，也就是二社最前面的田地上，因为隔着一条低凹小路，就不再往前流了。因此，每年在用水繁忙的季节，两个社为了用水不平均常闹纠纷，影响团结和生产。
    今年，在兴修水利的时候，两个社共同研究和商量了征服这条低凹路，他们用石头在路上垒起几个石墩，在墩上修了一条长木槽。从此，泉水不再厚此薄彼，两个社也再不闹纠纷了。
    一条木槽使它们心连心，共同搞好生产，共同走富裕道路；兴修水利，使两个农业社团结起来。右图是“团结水槽”。
