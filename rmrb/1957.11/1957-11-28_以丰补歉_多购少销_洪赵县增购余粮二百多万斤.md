Using Surplus to Make Up for Deficiencies, More Purchases and Less Sales
Hong Zhao County Increases Purchase of Surplus Grain by More Than Two Million Jin

(Our newspaper's dispatch) Shanxi's Hong Zhao County implemented the spirit of using surplus to make up for deficiencies, more purchases and less sales. The grain conference held last month achieved very good results, and the county's grain purchase figures for this year increased by more than two million jin compared to the original allocation.

This conference was conducted on the basis of the rural cadres' rectification meeting held by the County Party Committee, continuing to use the method of large-scale debate. All township and commune cadres initially established a correct attitude towards the grain issue. In the past, such meetings often resulted in calculating lower and lower yields, smaller and smaller sales volumes, while calculating larger and larger sales amounts. This time, during the debate, everyone showed great enthusiasm for selling more and saving grain to support socialist construction, which increased the county's total grain output from 140 million jin to 143 million jin this year. Communes with good harvests proposed to sell more surplus grain, and communes with reduced production also voluntarily reduced the supply. The county's supply figures decreased from 20 million jin to 17 million jin. The Nanqin Township Iron and Steel Cooperative was a reduced-production cooperative last year. This year, due to the full utilization of local water conservancy conditions, the land yield per mu reached 816 jin, an increase of 63% compared to last year. They sold a total of more than 680,000 jin of grain to the state this year, exceeding the requisitioned task by more than double. At the same time, they paid off all outstanding debts from last year and all state loans. (Lü Jianzhong)

    以丰补歉　多购少销
    洪赵县增购余粮二百多万斤
    本报讯　山西洪赵县贯彻以丰补歉多购少销的精神，在上月召开了粮食会议，效果很好，全县今年粮食征购数字比原分配数字增加了二百多万斤。
    这个会是在县委召开了农村干部整风会议的基础上，继续用大辩论的方式进行的。全体乡、社干部对待粮食问题都初步树立了正确的态度，过去开这种会往往是产量越算越低、售粮数越算越小，而销量却越算越大，这次在辩论中大家对多卖和节约粮食支援社会主义建设的劲头很大，使全县今年的粮食总产量由一亿四千万斤增到一亿四千三百万斤。丰收社纷纷提出多卖余粮，减产社也自动压缩供应量，全县供应数字由二千万斤减至一千七百万斤。南秦乡钢铁社去年是减产社，今年由于充分发挥了当地的水利条件，土地每亩产量达到八百一十六斤，比去年提高了63％。他们今年共交售给国家六十八万多斤粮食，超过应征购任务一倍多，同时把去年的尾欠和所有国家贷款一律还渍。　　　　　　　　（吕建中）
