Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, November 11th: The Chinese Modern Woodcut Exhibition opened in Jakarta on the evening of the 10th, sponsored by the Indonesia-China Friendship Association.

The Mayor of Jakarta, Sudiro, the Chairman of the Cultural and Educational Committee of the Indonesian Parliament, Sudarsono, and leaders of various Indonesian cultural and artistic groups, accompanied by the Chinese Ambassador to Indonesia, Huang Zhen, visited the exhibition.

After carefully viewing the exhibits, Sudiro exclaimed in admiration, "How were these carved? It's simply hard to imagine. These works, with modern life as their subject matter, reflect the most appealing spirit of revolutionary construction."

Sudarsono and others stated that the exhibition was very rich in content, and one viewing was not enough; they would come again later to appreciate it carefully.

The exhibition featured a total of 141 works, including works on the theme of the former Indonesian Vice President Dr. Hatta's visit to China. This is only a portion of the recent works of Chinese woodcut artists in the past two years.
