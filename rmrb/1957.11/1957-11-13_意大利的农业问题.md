    The Agricultural Problems of Italy
    By Umberto Terracini, Member of the Directing Committee of the Italian Communist Party

    For a century, agricultural problems have played a decisive role in the lives of the Italian people and in the country's affairs. In recent years, the peasant masses, having gained a new understanding of their own strength through their struggle against fascism and their victory in the War of Liberation, have been emboldened to rely on all other exploited classes to fight for their as-yet unacknowledged rights. This has made the agricultural problem even more prominent. While it cannot be said that all government crises after 1953 were caused by agricultural problems, the agricultural problem, specifically the issue of tenancy contracts, was one of the causes of government crises. Ruling parties often failed because they could not simultaneously protect the interests of the landowners and satisfy the demands of the peasants to some extent.

    Agriculture occupies a very important position in Italy. This is because the Italian bourgeois revolution, which occurred around the middle of the last century, was completed under the slogan of national unity, and had nothing to do with the peasants. The liberal government produced by the revolution did not touch the large Catholic landowners—who had vehemently opposed national unity—but retained all the old agricultural systems. These old agricultural systems were the social foundation of the many small despotic states that had once flourished in Italy. Of course, after the country was politically unified, the development of urban capitalism in the north had a certain impact on the countryside. But it must be admitted that until the defeat of fascism, land ownership and production relations remained in the most backward forms.

    The occupation of cultivated land in Italy can be divided into the following three main types: The first type is large tracts of cultivated land with an area of more than one hundred hectares, up to tens of thousands of hectares. Most of these cultivated lands belong to six thousand large aristocrats in central and southern Italy. The second type is tens of thousands of cultivated lands with an area of twenty to one hundred hectares. This type of cultivated land belongs to the urban middle class and wealthy peasants. The last type is small plots of cultivated land, often less than half a hectare, numbering about one million. The first type of cultivated land is distributed in the Po River Plain, Tuscany, Puglia, and Sicily; southern Italy has vast estates that grow only one crop. The second type of cultivated land is distributed in hilly areas, and crop production varies according to local climate and soil characteristics. The third type of cultivated land is distributed in high-altitude areas and mountainous areas, producing a variety of crops, all of which are consumed by the peasant families.

    From a technical point of view, Italian agriculture includes large-scale capitalist enterprises equipped with modern and excellent agricultural machinery and employing labor; generally speaking, sharecroppers have sufficient labor tools; tenant farmers have only a little traditional and outdated farm implements; tenant farmers have almost no means of production, and their numbers are constantly increasing due to the natural growth of family members. Therefore, on the one hand, they constantly flow into cities that are already filled with two million permanently unemployed people, and on the other hand, they flow abroad, like chronic hemorrhages, causing Italy to lose immeasurable wealth—valuable human resources.

    The labor relations in Italian agriculture can also supplement the brief analysis above. Italian agricultural laborers can be divided into independent laborers and dependent laborers. The former are mostly "day laborers" (people who sell their labor), who work short-term jobs every day from April to November each year, moving from one farm to another as needed, without any guarantee of long-term work, and are almost always unemployed from November to March of the following year. There are nearly 1.8 million of these people. Secondly, there are 300,000 employees, almost all of whom are employed by capitalist enterprises for a term of one year, with a portion of their wages paid in kind. They work like livestock, are subject to extremely strict discipline, and live in very poor conditions. Among the dependent laborers, the first are sharecroppers, about 2.3 million, who share the production costs equally with the landlord and also have the right to divide half of the main agricultural products. Secondly, there are 200,000 tenant farmers, who receive in-kind payments for their labor based on the agricultural products they grow, but the amount they receive does not exceed one-third of the harvest. There are 2.98 million tenant farmers, who pay the landlord rent often calculated in a certain amount of grain (wheat, flax, sweet beets, etc.). The last category is self-cultivating farmers, nearly 3.9 million, who are small landowners and medium-sized landowners. They cultivate their own small plots of land and do not hire employees.

    Approximately 8.4 million agricultural laborers in Italy work on 16 million hectares of land, of which 6 million hectares are cultivated by landowners, 3 million hectares are cultivated by tenant farmers, 4.83 million hectares are cultivated by sharecroppers, 500,000 hectares are cultivated by tenant farmers, and 1.75 million hectares are operated by capitalist enterprises.

    The gradual reduction of the national cultivated land area and the various changes in land ownership and labor relations illustrate the complexity of class struggle and the difficulty of reconciling and unifying the demands of these classes on a common basis. However, land reform can still achieve this goal to some extent, although there are many shortcomings in the specific contents stipulated by land reform. The Republic's Constitution does not stipulate any restrictions on the amount of land that landowners should own per capita in terms of land reform, but the Communist Party, in its program, has suggested that landowners' land should not exceed 100 hectares or 50 hectares, depending on local characteristics.

    Currently, peasant and agricultural employee organizations with various political tendencies are demanding land reform. Among these organizations, field laborers account for a large proportion. The peasants of Italy have a long and heroic tradition of struggle, with brilliant achievements in the second half of the 19th century. At that time, the peasant uprisings shook southern Italy, Sicily, and Sardinia (the peasant uprising in 1898 caused a political crisis that shook the whole country). In northern Italy, "day laborers" who were awakened by the initial socialist propaganda launched huge strikes before the industrial workers.

    Until the eve of World War I, the "day laborer" trade union organizations and sharecropper organizations were led by the Socialist Party. However, the Socialist Party was indifferent to the peasants who were still oppressed by the most reactionary social forces despite their organizational participation in the trade unions. This attitude created opportunities for Catholicism to operate among poor and middle peasants. These peasants have been ideologically dominated by the church for a long time. To this day, the Christian Democratic Party still controls most of the organizations of poor and middle peasants. The bourgeoisie is, of course, very pleased with this political and organizational division of agricultural laborers. The fascists used this division to consolidate their regime.

    However, in times of sharp social and political contradictions, this situation cannot prevent various movements from converging into an irresistible torrent, which often forces the large landowners to make huge concessions. After the collapse of fascist rule, poor peasants occupied undeveloped or underdeveloped land in the south and carried out reclamation there; sharecroppers in the central region demanded an increase in the distribution of agricultural products; and "day laborers" in the north carried out persistent struggles to increase wages and guarantee a minimum number of working days per year. These all confirmed this power.

    The movement to occupy large estates between 1945 and 1948 became the primary event in the social and political life of the entire region. The peasant movement was initially spontaneous and easily suppressed, but later gradually became led by left-wing parties—the Communist Party and the Socialist Party. This huge revolutionary wave shook the cities and villages. On agreed-upon days, residents of many villages near the large estates gathered in one place with carts, plows, livestock, sickles, and hoes, and then marched in formation, holding red flags and religious icons, to the designated location, where they distributed the land. In the first few governments after the war, members of the Communist Party and the Socialist Party in the cabinet tried their best to prevent the unexpected and fierce persecution that the mass movement might encounter. Because the measures taken by the peasants damaged the rule of the large landowners, the large landowners carried out brutal retaliation and systematically murdered the leaders of peasant organizations; in Sicily alone, thirty-four peasant leaders were murdered in five years, and the police never apprehended the murderers. In order to legalize the land occupied by the peasants and enable them to cultivate it, a decree was promulgated stipulating that peasants could enjoy these lands if they formed labor cooperatives. After the Constitution was promulgated, a new upsurge of struggle was launched in the countryside. The first Republican Parliament passed a land reform law stipulating the expropriation of 700,000 hectares of land from large landowners and the distribution to approximately 100,000 peasant households. But as mentioned above, this incomplete land reform only touched the old agricultural system of Italy on the surface. In fact, because the peasants were waiting for the distribution of the small amount of land stipulated by the law, the movement to occupy large estates had temporarily stopped. But once this period passed, the movement rose again.

    The struggle goals of tenant farmers and sharecroppers are different. When tenant farmers propose freezing rents (so far, the law protects the increase of rents), sharecroppers propose distributing agricultural products in a 53 to 47 ratio, opposing the currently implemented 50-50 ratio. Nevertheless, for several years, tenant farmers and sharecroppers have taken united and increasingly broad actions on the issue of legally confirming the modification of tenancy contracts. The main content of this requirement is to determine "just cause for dismissal," that is, landlords have no right to dismiss farmers unless there is a legally prescribed fault. Landlords naturally understand that this measure damages their land ownership, so they strongly oppose it. The political fortress of the parties, led by the ruling Christian Democratic Party, is precisely theirs. The peasants of Italy have abandoned the ideological differences that exist between their organizations and maintained complete unity of action in this struggle. This situation exactly explains why the government always encounters crises on agricultural contract issues.

    Finally, regarding the "day laborers," they are the pioneers of strikes. Every year during the agricultural busy season (harvesting, threshing, rice harvesting, mowing, harvesting sweet beets), they always turn the Po River Plain and the Puglia Plateau into a stage for severe struggles. The struggle goals of the "day laborers" are generally to increase wages and improve working conditions. Since the beginning of this century, most "day laborers" have not been able to work more than 120 days a year, so they have carried out a unique struggle that has not occurred in other countries, and have already won victories. The goal of this struggle is that large landowners must employ a certain percentage of day laborers in the off-season to improve the soil on their cultivated land. Although the victories achieved in this regard were immediately affirmed by a decree after the victory of the anti-fascist struggle, the landlords have been trying to evade this obligation, and the government has tolerated the illegal activities of the landlords. Therefore, workers must constantly fight to defend this decree.

    The above brief summary of class struggle in Italian agriculture clearly illustrates the basic characteristics of the Italian agricultural transformation and development process. This is not a peaceful development process without the huge resistance of socially reactionary elements. The following are some materials cited from a recent book published in Rome: From January 1948 to September 1954, seventy-five laborers sacrificed in the movement to occupy large estates and field strikes, five thousand one hundred and four people were injured, and one hundred and forty-eight thousand two hundred and sixty-nine people were arrested and imprisoned, of which sixty-one thousand two hundred and thirty-four people were sentenced to a total of twenty thousand four hundred and twenty-six years of imprisonment.

    Just as in other places, the working people of Italy must pay a heavy price to achieve liberation and social progress.

    意大利的农业问题
    意大利共产党指导委员会委员　翁伯托·特拉齐尼
    一世纪以来，农业问题在意大利的人民生活和国家生活中起着决定性的作用。近年来，由于人民进行了反对法西斯主义的斗争并在解放战争中获得了胜利，农民群众对于自己的力量有了新的认识，这鼓舞了他们依靠其他一切被剥削阶层来争取尚未被承认的权利，因此农业问题更加突出起来。虽然不能说1953年后的历届政府危机全是由农业问题引起的，但农业问题，具体地讲，租佃合同问题，是构成政府危机的原因之一。执政党经常因为不能同时既保卫地主的利益，又多少满足农民的要求而遭到失败。
    农业问题在意大利占有很重要的地位。因为大约发生于上一世纪中叶的意大利资产阶级革命，是在国家统一的口号下完成的，和农民完全无关。革命所产生的自由政府并未触动天主教大地主——他们曾猛烈反对国家统一——而是保留了全部旧的农业制度。这些旧的农业制度正是过去以意大利为温床的许多小专制国家的社会基础。当然国家在政治上统一以后，北部城市资本主义的发展对于农村有一定的影响。但必须承认，一直到法西斯溃败为止，土地所有制和生产关系都停留在最落后的形式上。
    意大利耕地的占有情况可以分为以下三种主要类型：第一类是面积为一百公顷以上，多至上万公顷的大块耕地。这些耕地大部属于中部和南部的六千名大贵族。第二类是面积为二十至一百公顷的几万块耕地。这类耕地属于城市中产阶级和富农。最后一类是面积很小、往往不到半公顷的小块耕地，约有一百万块。第一类的耕地分布在波河平原、托斯干纳、普格里亚和西西里；意大利的南部有广大的种植单一作物的大庄园。第二类耕地分布在丘陵地带，作物生产按各地的气候和土壤的特点而有所不同。第三类耕地分布在地势高的地区和山地，生产多种作物，全部收成供农民家庭消费。
    从生产技术上来看，意大利的农业中有规模巨大的资本主义企业，它们备有现代化的优良农业机器，雇佣着劳动力；一般说来，伙种农都拥有足够的劳动工具；分益农只有一点传统的、陈旧的农具；佃农几乎没有生产手段，后者的数字由于家庭成员的自然增长而在不断地增加。因此他们一方面不断地流入已充塞着二百万固定失业者的城市，一方面流往国外，像慢性出血症一样，使意大利失去不可计量的财产——宝贵的人力。
    意大利农业中的劳动关系也可以补充说明上面简短的分析。意大利农业劳动者可分为独立劳动者和非独立劳动者。前者大部是“短工”（出卖劳动力的人），这些人每年从4月到11月每天做短工，按需要从一家农场走到另一家农场，没有长期工作的任何保证，而且从每年11月到下一年3月几乎总是失业。这种人有将近一百八十万。其次是三十万雇工，他们几乎都是受雇于资本主义企业，雇佣期限是一年，有一部分实物工资。他们像牲畜一般地劳动，受着极严格的纪律束缚，居住条件很恶劣。在非独立劳动者中，首先是伙种农，约有二百三十万人，他们和主人对半分担生产费用，也有权利分得一半主要农产品。其次是二十万分益农，他们根据所种植的农产品取得实物作为劳动力的代价，但是所得部分不超过收成的三分之一。佃农有二百九十八万人，他们缴给地主的地租往往是以一定数量的粮食（小麦、麻、甜萝卜等）来计算。最后一类是自耕农，约近三百九十万，是小土地所有者和中等土地所有者。他们耕种自己的小块土地，不雇佣雇工。
    意大利约有八百四十万农业劳动者在一千六百万公顷土地上劳动，其中六百万公顷土地由土地所有者耕种，三百万公顷土地由佃农耕种，四百八十三万公顷土地由伙种农耕种，五十万公顷土地由分益农耕种，一百七十五万公顷土地由资本主义企业经营。
    全国耕地面积的日益减少和土地所有关系与劳动关系的变化多端，说明阶级斗争的复杂性，也说明在共同的基础上调和与统一这些阶级的要求是很困难的。不过，土地改革还可以在一定程度上实现这个目的，尽管土地改革所规定的具体内容有很多不够的地方。共和国宪法在土地改革方面并没有规定地主按人口计算应拥有多少土地的限制，但是共产党在它的纲领中曾建议规定地主的土地按各地特点不得超过一百公顷或五十公顷。
    目前有各种政治倾向的农民和农业雇工组织都要求土地改革。在这些组织中，田间劳动者占很大比例。意大利的农民有着长期的、英勇的斗争传统，十九世纪后半叶即有过光辉灿烂的事迹。当时农民的起义，曾震撼了意大利南部、西西里岛和萨丁岛（1898年农民起义造成了震动全国的政治危机）。在意大利北部，受到社会主义最初宣传影响而觉悟了的“短工”，曾在工业工人之前发动了巨大的罢工。
    直到第一次世界大战前夕，“短工”工会组织和伙种农组织都是由社会党领导的。但是社会党对那些在组织上参加了工会而仍然受着最反动的社会势力压迫的农民抱着漠不关心的态度。这种态度给天主教在贫农与中农当中活动创造了机会。这些农民很长时期以来在思想上就受着教会的支配。到今天为止，天主教民主党仍然把持了大部分贫农与中农的组织。资产阶级当然很惬意于农业劳动者这种政治上与组织上的分裂。法西斯主义者就曾利用过这种分裂来巩固它的政权。
    但是在社会矛盾与政治矛盾尖锐的时期，这种情况并不能阻碍各种运动汇合成为一支不可抗拒的巨流，这股巨流常常迫使大地主不得不做出巨大的让步。法西斯统治崩溃之后，贫穷的农民占据了南部未开垦的或未充分开垦的土地，在那里进行开垦，中部地区伙种农要求增加应得农作物的分配量，北部“短工”为争取增加工资和保证每年最低工作日进行坚持的斗争，这些都证实了这种力量。
    1945到1948年间占据大庄园的运动成为整个地区社会与政治生活中的首要事件。农民运动起初是自发的，容易受到阻止，后来渐渐为左派政党——共产党和社会党所领导。这股巨大的革命浪潮震动了城市和乡村。在约定好的日子，大庄园附近很多乡村里的居民都带着大车、犁、牲口、镰刀、锄头到一个地方集合，然后列队、高举着红旗和圣像向指定地点进发，到达以后，便分配土地。在战后头几届政府中，共产党和社会党的阁员曾极力防止了群众运动可能遇到的意外的激烈的迫害。由于农民们采取的措施损害了大地主的统治，大地主就进行了残酷的报复，有计划地杀害农民组织的领袖；仅西西里一地，在五年中就有三十四个农民领袖被杀害，而警察从未缉获凶手。为了使农民占领的土地合法化并能进行耕种，曾颁布法令，根据这条法令，农民在组成劳动合作社的情况下，可以享有这些土地。宪法公布以后，农村中又掀起了新的斗争高潮。第一届共和议会通过一项土改法，这项法令规定剥夺大地主七十万公顷土地，分配给大约十万户农民。但是正如上面所说的，这种不彻底的土改仅在表面上触动了意大利的旧农业制度。事实上，由于农民等待着法令规定的小量的土地分配，占据大庄园的运动曾经暂时停顿了。可是这个时期一过，运动又起来了。
    佃农与伙种农的斗争目标是不相同的。当佃农提出冻结地租（到目前为止，法令保护地租的提高）时，伙种农却提出要按五十三与四十七的比例来分配农产品，反对目前所实行的对半分比例。尽管如此，几年以来，在要求从法律上确认修改租佃合同的问题上，佃农与伙种农采取了团结一致和日益扩大的行动。这项要求的主要内容是确定“解雇的正当原因”，即如果没有法律上所规定的过失，地主没有权利解雇农民。地主自然了解这项措施有损于他们的土地所有权，所以极力反对。以执政党天主教民主党为首的党派正是他们的政治堡垒。意大利的农民们放弃了他们所属组织之间存在着的思想分歧，在这一斗争中保持着行动上的完全一致。这种情况正好说明为什么政府总是在农业合同问题上遭到危机。
    最后谈到“短工”，他们是罢工的先驱者，每年农忙期间（收割、打麦、打稻、割草、收割甜萝卜）他们总是把波河平原和普格里亚高原变为严酷斗争的舞台。“短工”的斗争目标一般都是提高工资和改善工作条件。自本世纪初，大部分“短工”都未做到每年一百二十个以上的工作日，因此他们进行了一种在其他国家未曾发生过的独特的斗争，而且已赢得了胜利。这个斗争目标是大地主在农闲季节必须雇用一定比例数字的短工在他的耕地上改良土壤。虽然在这方面取得的胜利已在反法西斯斗争胜利后马上由一项法令肯定了下来，但地主一直在企图逃脱这种义务，而政府方面也容忍地主的违法活动。因此劳动者必须不断地进行斗争来保卫这项法令。
    以上意大利农业的阶级斗争的简况，清楚地说明意大利农业改造发展过程的基本特点。这不是一个没有社会上反动分子的巨大阻力的和平发展过程。以下引证的是最近在罗马出版的一本书中的一些材料：自1948年1月至1954年9月，在占据大庄园的运动和田间罢工中有七十五个劳动者牺牲，五千一百零四人受伤，十四万八千二百六十九人被捕入狱，其中六万一千二百三十四人被判处共达二万零四百二十六年的监禁。
    正像在其他地方一样，意大利的劳动人民群众要取得解放和社会进步，也要付出重大的代价。　　　　　（本报特约稿）
