    Old Tree Encounters Spring and Sprouts New Branches
    ——Dancer Wu Xiaobang Returns to the Stage
    On the evening of the 9th, Wu Xiaobang, a dancer over fifty years old, who had been away from the stage for twelve years, and well-known to all of us, met the audience for the first time on the capital's stage. How can people not believe that it is the Party's brilliant "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom" policy for literature and art that has encouraged this middle-aged dancer to don his dance costume again and step onto the stage.
    The first thing dancer Wu Xiaobang brought to the capital's audience was a collection of representative works from various periods since he began creating dances in 1932, and a small number of ancient Chinese dances that have been collected and compiled in recent years. These dances are fresh and unique to the audience in the capital. Among them, such as the satirical dance "Puppet" created in 1932 because Japanese imperialism supported the puppet Puyi to become the "Pseudo-Manchu Emperor"; "March of the Volunteers," created in 1937 when the whole country set off an anti-Japanese upsurge, based on Nie Er's music and Tian Han's lyrics; "Hunger Fire," depicting the scene around 1942 when hungry people often died on the streets in the Kuomintang-controlled areas; and works such as "Thinking of Mortal World" can all evoke memories of the past and arouse resentment towards the dark life of the old society. We can see that the author tried to make his works reflect the reality of the time and combine them with political movements.
    Wu Xiaobang told reporters that although he had been away from the stage for many years, under the leadership of the Party, he had also improved himself through continuous learning from tradition and cultivating the younger generation. The vigorous new life prompted him to yearn for restoring his stage life, so that his past works could have the opportunity to meet today's vast audience and better exert his work experience. Now, the wish of this elderly dancer has been realized. Under the kind care of the Party and the government, a "Tianma Dance Art Studio" has been established, headed by him. The ancient Chinese dances "Taiping Dance" and "Yue Di Dance" performed this time were performed by the students of the studio. They will continue to strive to collect, sort out and reproduce this precious heritage of the motherland.
    Before this performance, since June this year, Wu Xiaobang had performed in Chongqing, Chengdu, Kunming, Guiyang, Tianjin and other places. He not only met old intellectual audiences from the past, but also had many new worker audiences welcoming him. He said: "This has increased my confidence. I will continue to work on the stage for another ten years." We believe that the new society can rejuvenate elderly artists. (Zhu Shulan) (Attached picture)

    老树逢春重发枝
    ——舞蹈家吴晓邦重上舞台
    9日晚，一位年过五十，离开了舞台十二年，我们大家熟知的舞蹈家吴晓邦在首都舞台上和观众初次见面了。人们怎能不相信，是党的英明的“百花齐放”文艺方针，鼓舞了这位年已半百的舞蹈家重着舞衫，登上舞台。
    舞蹈家吴晓邦第一次带给首都观众的，是他从1932年开始舞蹈创作以来，各时期具有代表性的作品，和少数近年来收集和整理出来的中国古代舞蹈。这些舞蹈对于首都观众来说是新鲜的、别具风格的。其中如1932年因日帝国主义扶植傀儡溥仪去当“伪满皇帝”而创作的讽刺舞蹈“傀儡”；1937年全国掀起抗日热潮，根据聂耳作曲、田汉作词所创作的“义勇军进行曲”；描写1942年前后，国民党统治区城乡街道上经常有饥饿的人死在街头的“饥火”；以及“思凡”等作品，都能使观众回忆起当年的情景，激起对旧社会黑暗生活的愤恨。我们可以看出，作者力图使自己的作品反映当时的现实生活，和政治运动结合。
    吴晓邦对记者说：这些年来他虽然离开了舞台，但是在党的领导下，从不断的向传统学习，和培养青年一代的工作中，自己也得到了提高。蓬勃的新生活便促使他向往着恢复舞台生活，让自己过去的作品能有机会和今天的广大观众见面，更好地发挥自己的工作经验。如今，这位年长的舞蹈家的愿望实现了，在党和政府的亲切关怀下，已建立了一个由他主持的“天马舞蹈艺术工作室”。这一次演出的中国古代舞蹈“太平舞”“龠翟舞”等就是工作室的学员表演的。他们将要继续为收集、整理和再现祖国的这份珍贵遗产而努力。
    在这次演出之前，今年6月以来，吴晓邦曾到重庆、成都、昆明、贵阳、天津等地演出。他不仅和过去的知识分子老观众见了面，还有许多新的工人观众欢迎着他。他说：“这使我增加了信心。我还要继续在舞台上工作十年。”我们相信，新社会是能使老年的艺术家恢复青春的。　（朱树兰）（附图片）
