    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 4th: Under the socialist system, the Soviet Union has not only greatly surpassed capitalist countries such as the United States in terms of the growth rate of industrial and agricultural production and the increase in labor productivity, but also in terms of the speed of national income increase, the rise of people's real wages, and the improvement of people's living welfare, it is ahead of the capitalist world.
    The total national economic income is the source of improved material welfare for the Soviet people. In terms of growth rate, the growth of the Soviet Union's national income is a straight upward red line, while that of the United States, Britain, France, and other countries is an undulating oblique line with little overall increase. Calculated on a per capita basis, the national economic income of the Soviet Union in 1956 increased more than twelvefold compared to 1913, while the United States only increased by about 80%, and Britain and France only increased by 60%.
    The real wages of Soviet workers have been increasing year by year. In 1956, compared with the pre-war year of 1940, real wages increased by 82%. However, the real wages of workers in capitalist countries are decreasing year by year. For example, the real wages of workers in France and Italy have decreased by more than 50% compared with pre-war levels. In the United States, due to the continuous rise in prices, the real wages of laborers are also gradually declining. In the Soviet Union, the various allowances, subsidies, and the cost of various welfare facilities paid to the working people by the state and enterprises are increasing every year. In 1940, the total expenditure in this area was 42 billion rubles, which increased to 169 billion rubles last year, and this year the expenditure in this area will reach 192 billion rubles. This means that now, on average, every person in the Soviet Union receives about 1,000 rubles per year in various extra income paid by the state and enterprises.
    The consumption of consumer goods by the Soviet people is increasing every year. Compared with 1940, the purchase of cloth by workers' families increased by 94%, and the purchase by collective farmers' families doubled. The per capita consumption of meat increased by 62% for workers and staff, and 54% for collective farmers. In the United States, according to official American materials, 70% of families do not have enough income to meet the minimum living standards.
    As a result of increased income, the savings and deposits of the Soviet working people in banks are increasing year by year. In 1956, the total amount of people's savings increased by about eight times compared to the pre-war year of 1940, and four times compared to 1948. The debt of working people in capitalist countries is constantly increasing. For example, the total debt of American farmers at the beginning of 1956 reached 18.8 billion US dollars, more than one and a half times more than in 1946.

### 国民收入增加　实际工资提高　生活福利增进  苏联走在任何资本主义国家前面

    国民收入增加　实际工资提高　生活福利增进
    苏联走在任何资本主义国家前面
    据新华社莫斯科4日电　在社会主义制度下，苏联不仅在工农业生产增长速度和劳动生产率提高速度方面大大超过了美国等资本主义国家，而且在国民收入增加的速度、人民实际工资的提高以及人民生活福利的增进方面也走在资本主义世界的前面。
    国民经济总收入是苏联人民提高物质福利的来源。就增长速度而论，苏联的国民收入的增长是一条笔直上升的红线，而美、英、法等国是起伏不定而结果上升不大的一条斜线。按人口计算的国民经济收入，苏联1956年比1913年提高了十二倍多，而美国只提高了约80％，英、法两国只提高了60％。
    苏联工人的实际工资年年都在增加，1956年和战前1940年相比，实际工资提高了82％。而资本主义国家工人的实际工资却在年年下降，例如，法国和意大利工人的实际工资比战前降低了50％以上；在美国，由于物价的不断高涨，劳动者的实际工资也逐渐下降。在苏联，由国家和企业付给劳动人民的各种津贴、补助费和各种福利设施的费用，每年都在增加。1940年，这方面的总支出为四百二十亿卢布，去年就增加到一千六百九十亿卢布，今年这方面的支出达到一千九百二十亿卢布。这就是说，现在全苏联平均每人每年获得国家和企业支付的各种额外收入约一千卢布。
    苏联人民生活消费品的消费数量每年在增加。以去年和1940年相比，工人家庭的布匹购买量增加了94％，集体农民家庭的购买量增加了一倍。按人口平均的肉类消费量，工人和职员增加了62％，集体农民增加了54％。在美国，按照美国的官方材料，有70％的家庭收入不够最低的生活标准。
    由于收入增加的结果，苏联劳动人民在银行中的存款和储蓄就逐年增加。1956年人民储蓄总额比战前1940年增加了约八倍，比1948年增加了四倍。资本主义国家劳动人民的负债额却在不断地增加。例如，美国农民1956年初的负债总额达一百八十八亿美元，比1946年多一倍半。
