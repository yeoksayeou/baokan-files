We are Now Living a Socialist Life

My name is Li Delu, and I am a bricklayer at the Shijingshan Power Plant Reconstruction Office. I have a wife and six children. I earn ninety yuan a month, and after eating well, dressing warmly, and sending my children to school, I still have money left over each month. Last year, when wages were reformed, I bought a clock and a radio. I attend meetings in the evening, and if there isn't a meeting, I listen to the radio. My older brother lives in the eastern suburbs, and I often take the children to visit. I know that the lives of farmers are indeed much better than before liberation, but they are still worse than ours as workers. Sometimes, my children complain that this isn't good, or that isn't good, and I get angry when I hear it. I tell them, "You live in a time when everything is good. Before liberation, I had to eat vegetables to fill my stomach before going to work. How would you know about that?" To be honest, compared to before liberation, we are now living a socialist life. I have nothing to say about my grade and salary, but I have some opinions about the factory's reward system and methods for training young workers.

Such "Rewards" are Unreasonable

First, let's talk about the reward system.

Our factory has had rewards since 1950, and they have gradually increased. People in the boiler, electrical, and turbine workshops receive "no-accident awards" that account for 10% to 30% of their base salary each month. Office staff receive quarterly bonuses. Workers in the mess hall, barbers, and nursery attendants also receive "task completion awards."

I'm not saying that all reward systems are undesirable, such as awards for rationalization proposals, which should exist. But some awards are unreasonable. Take the "no-accident award," which has the highest reward rate. I joined this factory as a repairman in 1942 and have been to every corner of the factory. Before liberation, the equipment was old, and there were no safety devices. Even if the workers stared intently, they couldn't guarantee that there wouldn't be accidents. The current working conditions are much better. For example, in the boiler workshop, although the boilers are old, most of the parts have been replaced with new ones. Unsafe equipment has been replaced with safe equipment, and inaccurate instruments have been replaced with accurate ones. In principle, workers should ensure safe power generation once they receive their wages. This is a worker's duty. Why should they receive a "no-accident award" for it? Does that mean accidents are acceptable?

Too Many and Too Broad Rewards Have Many Side Effects.

A fifth or sixth-grade production worker's monthly "no-accident award" is almost equal to the base salary of a worker in the administrative department. Most of the workers in the administrative department were transferred from production. Because the income difference is so large, some family members of administrative workers quarrel with their husbands, asking, "People are getting bonuses every month, why aren't you?" Some people are so bothered that they ask not to live with production workers. With the "no-accident award," it's very difficult to transfer people from production to other positions. Last year, the leadership wanted to transfer a fourth-grade bricklayer from the boiler workshop to the reconstruction office. Because there was no "no-accident award" at the reconstruction office, he refused to go no matter what. Although he reluctantly obeyed the transfer later, he was emotional for a whole year. It wasn't until February this year, when the leadership transferred him back, that he stopped complaining.

There's a bad trend in our factory, as if nothing can be done without money. This summer, during the major overhaul of the boiler, it wasn't enough to put large blocks of ice next to the machines. Each person was also given two mao to buy watermelon every day. Does eating watermelon make you not hot? I've only heard that you can't work without eating, but I've never heard that you can't work without eating watermelon. I've been in the boiler workshop for seven or eight years, and I know the boiler overhaul work well. It is indeed tiring during the overhaul, but we weren't afraid of being tired before liberation. Now that we are building socialism, we are afraid of being tired. What kind of reasoning is this?

It's Infuriating to Open Doors with Feet

There are problems with the current methods of training workers. Most of the workers who entered the factory after liberation graduated from junior high school, and a small number graduated from senior primary school. Having culture means they learn technology quickly, which is their advantage. Many young workers come from working-class families, and some participated in agricultural production at home, so they have a good attitude towards labor and cherish state property after entering the factory. However, many of them have not been tempered by physical labor, going from family to school to factory. As soon as they enter the factory, they learn specialized skills from master workers, so they don't understand the difficulties of production and construction, they despise physical labor, and they don't cherish state property.

In June of this year, we were building a house next to the clinic to house a turbine model. The leaders transferred four young workers from the turbine workshop to help us move bricks. I saw that they were all strong and healthy, and I was very happy, thinking that they would work even better than our old workers. Who knew that they had barely moved a few bricks before they went to rest under the office building. They chatted and complained, "Asking us to do this? We are junior high school graduates!"

I said, "Don't junior high school graduates have to work? How can we build socialism without labor?" No matter what I said, they wouldn't listen. I had no choice but to go to their workshop's union chairman, Dong Liwang, who brought them. Dong Liwang said, "I can't do anything with them either!"

During the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, I worked in the boiler workshop. Every time we repaired the boiler, we picked up all the leftover pipes, wires, iron heads, etc., so that not even a tiny piece of iron was dropped. The situation is different now. Some time ago, when the boiler workshop was repairing the boiler, no one cared about the leftover pipes, wires, etc. They were pulled by carts to the garbage dump by the river. Later, Zhang Guomao, an old worker from our reconstruction office, discovered it and made suggestions to their workshop, and they paid attention to it. Steel is so scarce in our country now, and you can't buy it even if you have money, but some young workers feel that the country is big and wealthy and don't care about anything. It's really heartbreaking.

Some young workers' lack of care for state property is also reflected in their housing. In April this year, the dormitory building opposite the north gate of our factory was just completed. The painted doors shone in the sunlight, which made people happy from the bottom of their hearts. One day, a young worker moved his luggage in. When he reached the door, he kicked it open with his leather shoe with a "bang". When I saw it, I felt like he kicked me. I got angry. I asked him which workshop he was from and what his name was. He didn't even bother to look at me and said:

"It's none of your business!"

I said, "It is my business. The house belongs to the country, and everyone should cherish it. Why didn't you open the door with your hand but kicked it open with your foot?" What's the use of me saying a few words to him? This is a problem of the entire education of young workers. I heard that some apprentices, when staying in the dormitory, get up at night to urinate and are afraid of the cold, so they chisel a hole in the door panel.

Many old workers are right: when young workers enter the factory, they should first go to the boiler workshop to carry coal for a year or two, taste the taste of physical labor, transform themselves, and then learn technology from master workers. This kind of training is good for young people. They can understand the hardship of production and construction through practice. At least some people won't treat state property and physical labor like that.

Can They Be Successors to Socialism?

When it comes to promotions, old workers can't compare to young workers. Old workers have worked for a dozen or twenty years and are now only grade five or six. New workers who entered the factory in 1951 and 1952 are now mostly grade four or five, and a few are grade six or seven. Including salary and bonus, some receive eighty or ninety yuan, and others receive one hundred thirty or forty yuan, which is as much as a section chief in a state agency. A young man just out of school, without having suffered any hardship, earns as much as old workers, or even more than old workers. How can this not make some of them proud and complacent? With more money than they know what to do with, even good children are ruined. Some people eat snacks until they are full, and when they read the newspaper, they first look at the drama and movie advertisements. When they go to the theater, they only want to see Ma Lianliang and Tan Fuying. Our factory's cafeteria has stir-fries, stews, braises, hot dishes, cold dishes, steamed buns, and rice. Sometimes there are even steamed buns with fillings. But some young workers are still not satisfied, claiming they want to buy bicycles and go to restaurants in Beixinan, four or five li away! They have too much money, they are not satisfied, and they demand more from the leaders. They want to do easy work with high bonuses and quick promotions. If they are sent to workshops with poor working conditions, they say they are "going to hell." Some people don't care about politics, don't attend meetings after work, and hide in the dormitory to rate the women comrades. We old workers want to tell them about eating mixed noodles and wearing burlap in the old society, to tell them to be thrifty and simple, but as soon as we open our mouths, some people argue back. They say:

"You were unlucky, you weren't born at the right time. We are the youth of the Mao Zedong era..."

Shouldn't the youth of the Mao Zedong era be thrifty and simple? Chairman Mao said that it will take three five-year plans to build a socialist society. We need to build many factories, we need a lot of money. If we spend a little money now on eating and clothing, what will we use to build? Some young workers, because they have been promoted too quickly and have received too much money, are probably forgetting the working class's ultimate goal of struggle. Can workers trained in this way be successors to socialism?

    要好好教育年青人
    ——记老工人李德禄的谈话
    本报记者　陆超祺
    现在过的就是社会主义生活
    我叫李德禄，是石景山发电厂改建处的瓦工。家里有老伴，还有六个孩子。我每月挣九十块钱，除了吃饱、穿暖和送小孩子上学外，每月都有余钱。去年工资改革的时候，买了一个钟，一台收音机，晚上开会就参加，没会就听听无线电。我哥哥在东郊，我经常带孩子去串门，知道农民的生活确实比解放以前好多了，但比我们工人还差一些。有的时候，我的孩子嫌这也不好，那也不好，我听了就生气。我对他们说：“你们生活在现在，什么都好；解放以前，我吃菜充饥去干活，你们那里知道？”说真的，和解放以前比，我们现在过的就是社会主义生活了。对自己的级别和工资，我没什么可说的，对厂里的一些奖励制度和培养青年工人的办法，我有点意见。
    这样“奖励”不合理先讲奖励制度。
    我们厂里从1950年开始有奖，以后一步一步高，锅炉、电气、汽机车间的人，每月拿的“无事故奖”占基本工资10％到30％。科室人员有季度奖。伙食团工人、理发工人、托儿所保育员也有“完成任务奖”。　　　
    我并不是说所有的奖励制度都要不得，比如合理化建议奖就应该有，而是说有些奖不合理。拿奖励率最高的“无事故奖”来说，我1942年就进这个厂当修理工，厂里那个角落都去过。解放以前，设备旧，什 么安全设备也没有，工人们眼睛看直了也不能保证不出事故。现在的劳动条件可好得多了。比如锅炉车间，虽然锅炉是旧的，但大部分零件都换成新的了，不安全的设备换了安全的，不准确的仪表换了准确的。按道理讲，工人拿了工资，就应该保证安全发电。这是工人的分内事，为什么还要拿“无事故奖”呢？难道出事故还是应该的吗？
    奖励太多太泛有很多副作用。一个五、六级的生产工人每月拿的“无事故奖”，差不多等于行政部门一个工人的基本工资。行政部门的工人大都是从生产上调来的，因为收入相差悬殊，有些行政部门的家属就跟自己的男人闹，问：“人家月月拿奖金，干吗你没拿？”有的人被闹得没办法，要求不要跟生产工人住在一起。有了“无事故奖”，要想从生产上调人到别的岗位去就非常困难。去年领导上从锅炉车间调个四级瓦工到改建处去，因为改建处没有“无事故奖”，说什么他也不愿去，后来虽然勉强服从调动了，但整整闹了一年情绪，直到今年2月，领导上把他调回去了，他才没意见。
    我们厂里有一种歪风，好像没钱就办不了事。今年夏天锅炉大检修的时候，机器旁边搁着大冰块还不够，每人每天还发两毛钱吃西瓜。吃了西瓜就不热了吗？只听说不吃饭干不了活，没听说不吃西瓜就不能干活。我在锅炉车间呆过七、八年，检修锅炉的活我清楚。检修的时候确实累一些，但解放以前不怕累，现在建设社会主义倒怕累起来了，这是什么道理呢？
    用脚开门真气人
    现在培养工人的办法有问题。解放后进厂的工人，大部分是初中毕业的，小部分是高小毕业的。有文化，技术学得快，这是他们的优点。很多青年工人都是劳动家庭出身，有些人在家里也参加农业生产，所以进厂以后，劳动态度也很好，也能爱护国家财产。但是，他们之中不少人，从家庭到学校，从学校到工厂，都没经过体力劳动的锻炼，一进工厂就跟老师傅学专门技术，所以不大懂得生产建设的艰难，轻视体力劳动，不爱护国家财产。
    今年6月，在医务室旁边盖一间房子，放汽机模型。领导上从汽机车间调四个青工来给我们搬砖头。我看见他们个个身强力壮，心里很高兴，以为他们干起活来一定比咱们老工人强。谁知道，他们没搬几块砖，就到办公大楼下面休息起来了。他们一面聊天，一面发牢骚：“叫我们干这个，我们是初中毕业生哪！”
    我说：“初中毕业生就不劳动吗？不劳动，怎能建设社会主义？”我左说右说，他们都不听，没办法，我就去找他们车间工会主席董立旺，是他带他们来的。董立旺说：“我对他们也没办法啊！”
    抗美援朝的时候，我在锅炉车间工作。每次修理锅炉，我们把剩下来的管子、铁丝、铁头等等，拾得干干净净的，真是寸铁不掉。现在情形不同了。前些时候，锅炉车间修理锅炉，剩下来的管子、铁丝等等没人理，给拉大车的拉到河边的垃圾堆去倒了。后来，我们改建处的老工人张国茂发现了，给他们车间提了意见，他们才注意了。现在国家的钢铁那样缺，有钱都买不到，有的青年工人却觉得家大业大了，什么都不在乎，真叫人心痛。
    有些青年工人不爱护国家财产，还表现在住房上面。今年4月，我们厂里北厂大门对面的那座宿舍大楼刚刚盖好，漆好的门扇在阳光下闪闪发光，看了叫人从心里高兴。有一天，有个青年工人搬行李进去，走到门口，用皮鞋“嘣”的一下把门踢开。我看了，就像他踢的是我一样，生起气来了。我问他是哪个车间的，叫啥名字。他连瞧也不瞧一眼，说：
    “你管不着！”
    我说：“我就管得着，房子是国家的，大家都应该爱护它，为什么不用手开门，而用脚踢呢？”我这样说他一两句有什么用呢？这是整个对青工的教育问题。听说，有些徒工住宿舍，冬天晚上起来小便怕冷，就在门板上凿个洞呢。
    很多老工人说得对：青工进厂的时候，首先到锅炉车间运一、二年煤，尝尝体力劳动的滋味，改造好了再跟老师傅学技术。这样锻炼对青年人有好处，可以从实践中体会生产建设的艰苦，起码有些人就不会那样对待国家财产和体力劳动了。
    他们能做社会主义的接班人吗？
    讲到升级，老工人跟青年工人比不得。老工人干了十几二十年，现在也不过五级、六级。1951年1952年进厂的新工人，现在多数是四级、五级，个别的是六级、七级。每月工资加奖金，少的拿八、九十元，多的拿一百三、四十元，跟国家机关一个处长拿的一样多。一个青年刚从学校出来，没受什么苦，拿的钱就和老工人的一样多，甚至比老工人的还多，这怎不叫他们中的一些人骄傲自满呢？钱多了没处花，很好的孩子也给折腾坏了。有的人吃零嘴也吃个饱，看报先看戏剧电影广告，看戏非马连良、谭富英不看。我们厂里的食堂，有炒的，有炖的，有熘的，有热的，有凉的，有馒头，有大米饭，有时候还有包子。但是有的青工还不满意，声言要买自行车，专门上离这里四、五里的北辛安吃馆子去！他们钱多了，不知足，对领导的要求更多。干活要挑轻松的，奖金多的，升级快的；派到工作条件比较差的车间去，就说是“进地狱”。有的人不关心政治，下班开会不参加，躲在宿舍里给女同志排队，打分数。我们老工人想给他们讲一讲旧社会里吃混合面，穿麻袋的生活，叫他们艰苦朴素点，但刚刚开口，就给一些人顶回来了。他们说：
    “你们倒霉，生的不是时候，我们是毛泽东时代的青年……”
    毛泽东时代的青年就不应该艰苦朴素吗？毛主席讲三个五年计划才建成社会主义社会。我们要建设很多工厂，要很多钱，现在有点钱就用在吃和穿上，用什么来建设呢？有些青年工人因为级升得太快，钱拿得太多，恐怕连工人阶级最后的奋斗目标都忘掉了。这样培养出来的工人，能做社会主义的接班人吗？（附图片）
