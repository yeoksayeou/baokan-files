    Average and Special
    Jin Zhen
    Unreformed intellectuals mostly harbor so-called "refined" thoughts. They often use beautiful phrases like "emerging from the mud unsullied," "not caring about fame and status," and having "unyielding integrity," as if they are people who are "not contending with the world" or have "seen through the vanity of life."
    Is this really the case? I don't think so. Take egalitarianism, for example. I think intellectuals are more seriously affected by it than small producers. Small producers' egalitarianism only seeks to obtain conditions for average development. Intellectuals, in addition to this, are influenced by the ideology of the exploiting classes, so their expressions are even more prominent. For example, if people who started working at the same time are promoted, but he is not, then he is distressed; seeing old friends and old classmates now in responsible positions, while he is still a general cadre, then he feels unfair; "He and I are about the same!"... As for the political quality and professional ability of others, and how he is in these aspects, he does not consider it. In their view, only by pulling others down, or promoting themselves, to make everything level, is this called "equality," otherwise it is the Party's "distrust" and "discrimination" against them.
    This is still from the main aspects. As for some small issues of living conditions, such as eating, taking the bus, watching a play, and even distributing bookshelves, they often cause their dissatisfaction and grievances. A young intellectual in our organization was greatly aggrieved by the issue of entering the cafeteria, saying something like "Eating in the dining hall (referring to the large canteen) first of all loses the dignity that a person should have," and so on. We said that whether some problems in the living system are reasonable can be studied, but how can it involve the so-called "human dignity"? This, in addition to illustrating the ulterior motives of this young man, also illustrates the absolute egalitarianism of generally intellectuals who are meticulous about material benefits. Refined? Not refined, not noble!
        Do intellectuals only emphasize "average"? Actually, it is not so. Their so-called average is "leveling" upwards, not downwards. Behind egalitarianism lies the idea of privilege. Generally speaking, people with serious egalitarianism are also people with serious privilege-seeking, only expressed differently under different conditions and at different times. Intellectuals believe that they have "knowledge" and demand special care from the Party and the people. Some self-proclaimed "well-known" people have particularly strong demands. They say that the new society is so unequal in this way and that way. In fact, they believe that the Party and the people's care for them is not "special" enough and have not treated them as "superior people." The young man mentioned above, in his self-criticism, did say a little bit of the truth: "...In fact, I myself wanted to truly enjoy the treatment of 'chief' and above, but for me, I felt that it would never be possible, so I also had a feeling of both envy and jealousy towards this phenomenon. ..."
    Originally, our Party and government have always valued intellectuals and have made appropriate arrangements for their work, life, and study, truly taking care of them meticulously, achieving that everyone is in the right place and making the best use of their talents. However, some people always feel dissatisfied. For example, they say that they cannot see documents, and that there are various restrictions on listening to reports and attending meetings, so it is sectarianism, and so on. In fact, the documents they can see, the meetings they can attend, and the reports they can listen to, they have all seen, heard, and participated in, except that some Party meetings they have not been allowed to participate in, and some Party documents they have not been allowed to see. But this has been labeled as the Party having "privileges." Demanding average and demanding special has reached such a degree, which is too shocking.
    The socialist distribution principle is to each according to his ability, to each according to his work. Absolute equality between people is impossible. Intellectuals understand these principles. But when they put forward their unreasonable demands, they often intentionally or unintentionally throw this principle aside. They have not properly measured whether the work they do is commensurate with the rewards and honors given by the people, forgetting who they should serve.
    Comrade Deng Xiaoping said in the "Report on the Rectification Movement": "The only way out for bourgeois intellectuals is to transform themselves and serve the socialist economic base; otherwise, there is a danger of becoming 'roof-top gentlemen' who are neither rooted in the sky nor on the ground." I think this is absolutely true.

    平均与特殊
    金真
    没有经过改造的知识分子，大都有所谓“清高”思想，他们往往用一些美丽的词句如“出污泥而不染”呀，“不计较名誉地位”呀，有“傲骨”呀等等，仿佛自己是“与世无争”或者是“看破红尘”的人了。
    真的如此么？我看不见得。就拿平均主义思想来说吧，我觉得知识分子还要比小生产者严重得多。小生产者的平均主义只是要得到平均发展的条件，知识分子呢，除这之外还有剥削阶级思想的影响，因此他们的表现还更突出一些。例如同是一个时候参加工作的，别人提级了，他没有提，于是他苦恼了；看见老朋友、老同学现在做负责工作，自己还是一般干部，于是他不平了；“他和我是半斤八两差不多呀！”……至于别人的政治品质如何，业务能力如何，自己在这方面又如何，他是不加考虑的。在他们看来，只有把别人拉下来，或者把自己提上去，放成一崭平，这才叫“平等”，否则就是党对自己的“不信任”和“歧视”。
    这还是从主要的方面来说的。至于一些生活待遇的小问题，如吃饭、坐车、看戏以至发书架等等，也往往会引起他们的不满和不平。我们机关有一位青年知识分子，就曾对进食堂的问题大为不平，说什么“进饭厅（指大食堂）吃饭，首先就失去了人应有的尊严”云云。我们说，生活制度上的一些问题是否合理是可以研究的，但是怎么会牵涉到所谓“人的尊严”去了呢？这除了说明这个青年的别有用心之外，也说明了一般知识分子的斤斤计较物质待遇的绝对平均主义思想。清高么？不清也，不高也！
        知识分子仅仅是讲究“平均”么？其实又不然，他们之所谓平均是“平”上不“平”下，在平均主义的背后隐藏着的是特权思想。一般的说，平均主义思想严重的人，也就是特权思想严重的人，只是在不同条件，不同时间，表现不同罢了。知识分子认为自己有“知识”，要求党和人民对他们特殊照顾，有的自命为“知名”人物的人，这种要求特别强烈。他们说新社会这样不平等，那样不平等，实际上是认为党和人民对他们的照顾还不够“特殊”，没有把他们当作“人上人”看待。上述那个青年在检讨中，对此倒说了一点点真话：“……其实我自己却是想真正得到‘长’以上的享受，然而这在我，觉得永远办不到，所以对这种现象也有一种既羡慕又嫉妒的情绪。……”
    本来，我们党和政府对知识分子一向就是重视的，对他们的工作、生活和学习都作了适当的安排，真是照顾得无微不至，做到了各得其所，人尽其才。然而有人却总是感到不满足。如说什么看不到文件呀，听报告和参加会议有种种限制因而是宗派主义呀等等。实际上，他们能够看的文件，能够参加的会议和能够听的报告，也都看到、听到和参加了，只是一些党内的会议没让他们参加，一些党内文件没让他们看而已。但是这就被加上了罪名，说是党内有“特权”。要求平均、要求特殊到了这种程度，也就太惊人了。
    社会主义的分配原则是各尽所能，按劳取酬，人与人之间不可能做到绝对的平等，这些道理知识分子是懂得的。但是当他们提出自己不合理的要求时，却往往有意无意地把这个原则抛在一边了。他们没有好好衡量一下自己做的工作与人民给予的报酬和荣誉是否相称，忘记了他们应该为谁服务。
    邓小平同志在“关于整风运动的报告”中说：“资产阶级知识分子的唯一出路就是改造自己，为社会主义的经济基础服务，否则就有变成上不沾天下不着地的‘梁上君子’的危险”。我看这是千真万确的。
