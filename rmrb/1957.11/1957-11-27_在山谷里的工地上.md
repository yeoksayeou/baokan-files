    On the Construction Site in the Valley
    The Teacher in the Valley
    As soon as Teacher Wu from the staff and workers' spare-time school stepped into the bamboo shed, the workers surrounded him. Little Li asked, "Teacher Wu, are you better now?"
    "Yes, thank you!" Teacher Wu put down the chalk, took off his glasses and wiped the mud and sand off them, as he answered everyone.
    Teacher Wu was called an intellectual of the working class by the workers. Whenever Teacher Wu was mentioned, the workers would talk about his stories.
    One night, Wang Xiaosheng, a dreg removal worker, fell ill, tossing and turning in bed, feeling as if something was pressing heavily on him. It wasn't until morning that he discovered a coat covering him. Xiaosheng called to Xiao Zhou, who slept on the bed above him, "Did your coat fall down?"
    "No, I don't have a coat." Xiao Zhou had just gotten out of bed and looked down. No one recognized whose cotton-padded coat it was. Old Lu walked over and took a look, saying:
    "It's clearly Teacher Wu's coat!" It turned out that Teacher Wu was afraid that Xiao Wang would get cold at night, so he covered him with it.
    An old worker told me: Teacher Wu often stays with us to improve our workers' literacy; during the day when we are at work, he follows us to the cliffs to carry stones and shovel dirt. Once, his hand was broken by a stone, and we advised him not to do it, but he criticized us in return: "Everyone has a share in building the motherland, you are workers, and so am I; in the classroom I am your teacher, here, I am your student."
    The Engineer Pushes a Wheelbarrow
    One afternoon, I went to the small cart sand and gravel yard for the first time. In the crowd, a young engineer was busily filling soil baskets with stones and sending them to the wheelbarrows. He glanced around thoughtfully, patted the dirt off his body, and said to a technician, "Come on, let's see who has the most energy!" Worker Wang Guisheng walked to the wheelbarrow and said, "Engineer, take a break, you've been working for more than three hours, you must be tired. Let us push it." The engineer was not convinced and joked, "We all have two hands and two legs, young man, let's compare!"
    The wheelbarrow went around the mountain pass, more than half a kilometer. The three people in front stopped a wheelbarrow, and the engineer saw it from afar and shouted, "Comrades, is the wheelbarrow not flexible and can't be pushed? Come on, let's switch and push!"
    "Engineer, this is heavy enough, can you do it?" Seeing how tired he was, I wanted to ask him to take a break, but he wouldn't listen, nodding repeatedly: "Yes! Yes!" When the wheelbarrow was speeding along, the sweat on his forehead rolled down, and a white shirt was dyed yellow long ago.
    The First Test
    One night, a typhoon carried heavy rain, crossed layers of mountains, and stirred up the river's waves to rush violently towards both banks. The soil layer on the cliff was washed away by the water. The work section leader issued the first order: "Comrades! Quick, quickly tie the ropes tightly and prepare everything." The section leader looked at the university interns who were studying blasting and concrete work, and his heart was always uneasy. Shao Zhongxia knew what he was thinking, and she raised her voice and shouted: "Don't worry, section leader, we can endure hardship just like the worker comrades; typhoons, rainstorms, and cold currents cannot extinguish our fiery hearts for building the motherland!"
    "All the preparatory work has been planned." Hu Tianling urged on the side.
    The vibration and leveling work of concrete are quite labor-intensive, but these difficulties finally did not make them succumb, and they persisted. Gong Roujian carried a 50-kilogram bag of cement at a time to the river channel to cast the arch dam. If it wasn't seen with one's own eyes, who would believe that this small female student, who is usually accustomed to reading in the classroom, has this energy?
    The pouring of concrete began. Typhoons, cold currents, and rainstorms pounced like beasts, but they did not shrink back, but instead persisted in drainage, leveling, vibration, and other work with redoubled spirit. In order to enable the gantry crane to accurately place the concrete to the predetermined target and increase the pouring speed, Shao Zhongxia picked up a five-meter-long bamboo pole tied with a red flag and supported the red flag under the attack of a level 6 typhoon. Her whole body was soaked with rain, and her face turned from red to cyanotic, and blood oozed from her shoes, which were scratched by rubble. However, she gritted her teeth and slowly struggled to get up again. The section leader came over and asked her to rest, and she said to the section leader: "It's nothing, there is a clause in our guarantee letter that we must be able to withstand the first test!"

    在山谷里的工地上	蒋蘅
    山谷里的教师
    职工业余学校的吴老师刚一跨进竹棚，工人们都围上来了。小李问：“吴老师，病好啦？”
    “好了，谢谢你！”吴老师把粉笔放下来，一边摘下眼镜擦了擦上面的泥沙，一面回答着大家。
    吴老师是被工人称为工人阶级的知识分子的，只要一提到吴老师，工人们就说起他的故事来。
    一个夜晚天，出碴工人王小生得了病，躺在床上翻来复去，似乎身上被一层东西压得重重的，一直到早上才发现身上盖着一件大衣。小生叫睡在他上面床铺的小周：“是你的大衣掉下来了吧？”
    “不，我没有大衣。”小周刚从床上站起，往下看了看。大家都认不出是谁的大棉袄。老陆走过来一看，说：
  “明明是吴老师穿的大衣哩！”原来是吴老师在夜里怕小王冻着替他盖上的。
    一位老工人告诉我：吴老师为了提高我们工人的文化，经常和我们在一起；白天我们上班时，他就跟着我们到悬崖上搬石头、铲土。有一次，他的手被石块砸破了，我们劝他不要干，他却反批评起我们来：“建设祖国大家都有份呀，你们是工人，我也是工人；在课堂里我是你们的老师，在这里，我就是你们的学生。”
    工程师推斗车
    一个下午，我初到小车沙石场去。在人群中一位年青的工程师正忙个不停地将土箕装满石子送上斗车，他出神地回顾了一下四周，拍了拍身上的泥土，对一位技术员说：“来吧，看看谁的劲头大！”工人王桂生走到斗车旁说：“工程师，你休息会吧，已经劳动了三个多钟头，够累的了，还是让我们来推吧。”工程师很不服气，打趣道：“我们都长着两只手，两条腿，小伙子，比比看吧！”
    斗车绕过山坳，足有一里多地。前面三个人推着一辆斗车停了下来，工程师老远就看出来了，喊：“同志们，是不是斗车不灵活，推不动啦吧？来，和你们换个儿推推！”
    “工程师，这个够沉的了，能行吗？”我见他累得那个样，想叫他休息一会，他哪肯听，连连点头：“行！行！”当斗车飞奔的时候，他额头上的汗珠簌簌地滚下来，把一件白衬衣早染成黄色的了。
          第一次考验
    一个深夜，台风抱着暴雨，越过层层山峦，激起河水的浪花向两岸猛冲，悬崖上的土层被水卷走了。工段长发出第一次口令：“同志们！快，快把绳子绑紧，做好一切准备工作。”段长看了看学习放炮工种和混凝土工种的大学的实习同学，心里总像吊水桶七上八下的。他的心思早被邵钟霞看出了，她拉开嗓门喊：“放心吧，段长，我们和工人同志一样能吃苦；台风暴雨寒流扑灭不了我们为祖国建设的火热的心！”
    “一切准备工作都计划好了。”胡天玲在一边急推。
    干混凝土的震动、平仓工作，劳动强度是相当大的，但这些困难终于没使她们屈服，她们坚持下来。龚柔坚一次就搬一包五十公斤的水泥送到河槽浇筑拱坝。假若不是亲眼看见，谁会相信平时习惯于课堂读书的这个小小个儿的女学生有这股劲呢？
    浇筑混凝土开始了。台风、寒流、暴雨像猛兽般扑来，他们没有畏缩，反而精神百倍地坚持排水、平仓、震动等等工作。为着使门式机能将混凝土准确地放到预定目标，提高浇筑速度，邵钟霞拿起一根五公尺长缚着红旗的竹杆，在六级台风的袭击下，支持着红旗。她的全身被雨水浸湿了，她的脸由红变成青色，被乱石划破的鞋渗出了鲜血。可是，她咬着牙，慢慢地又挣扎起来。段长走过来叫她休息，她对段长说：“没什么，我们的保证书上有一条，要经得起第一次考验！”
