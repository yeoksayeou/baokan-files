Xinhua News Agency, November 15th: A commemorative gathering for the world cultural figure and great Czech educator Jan Amos Comenius (Komensky) was held in Beijing tonight. This year marks the 300th anniversary of the publication of Comenius' great work "Opera Didactica Omnia," and November 15th is the anniversary of his death.

The commemorative gathering was jointly organized by five organizations: the China Peace Committee, the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Institute of Educational Science, and the Chinese Writers Association.

At the start of the commemorative gathering, all attendees stood to observe a minute of silence for the passing of Czechoslovak President Zápotocký.

Zhang Xiruo, Standing Committee Member of the China Peace Committee and Standing Director of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, delivered the opening speech at the commemorative gathering. He said that Comenius is first and foremost admired by the world as a great educator. But he was not only an educator, but also a thinker and socio-political activist. He was a democrat, a humanist, a patriot, and at the same time, an internationalist who advocated world peace and international cooperation.

Zhang Xiruo said that the name of Comenius is not unfamiliar to the Chinese people. More than ninety years ago, when China began to implement modern education, the name of the great educator Comenius was introduced to China. His classic work, "Didactica Magna," was translated into Chinese in 1939.

Zhang Xiruo said that we commemorate Comenius primarily for his great and outstanding contributions to human education. We commemorate Comenius also because he was a pioneer of the world peace movement. More than three hundred years ago, he began to advocate for the ideals of world peace and international cooperation.

Dr. Ervin Kukar, a Czech educator who came from Czechoslovakia to attend the commemorative gathering, delivered a report entitled "Jan Amos Comenius is a Fighter for Education and Social Reform." He said that Comenius is not only an outstanding figure of the Czech nation, but is also considered a world-renowned outstanding thinker and reformer of the early modern period. Comenius lives in the hearts of progressive people all over the world, because his educational ideas, which are closely related to social reform, far surpassed the historical scope of the seventeenth century in which he lived, and only a future socialist society can provide favorable conditions for the realization of such educational ideas. After introducing Comenius as an outstanding thinker and reformer, Dr. Ervin Kukar pointed out that Comenius' efforts for peace and comprehensive reform aimed at striving for a society "without the beasts preying on the weak, without the demons bringing war to people, and without the villains who harm others for their own benefit."

Dr. Ervin Kukar also presented a copy of Comenius' "Didactica Magna" to Chinese educators on behalf of Czechoslovak cultural and educational workers.

At the commemorative gathering, Cao Fu, a researcher at the Chinese Institute of Educational Sciences, delivered a report on "The Life and Thought of Jan Amos Comenius (Komensky)."

A congratulatory telegram from the Comenius Institute of the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences to the gathering was read at the meeting.

After the meeting, Chinese actors recited excerpts from Jan Amos Comenius' novel "The Labyrinth of the World and the Paradise of the Heart." The Czechoslovak music delegation, which is currently visiting here, also performed famous pieces by Smetana, Dvořák, and others.

More than 800 people attended the commemorative gathering, including Chu Tunan, President of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, and Shao Lizi, Standing Committee Member of the China Peace Committee.

Vacek, Counselor of the Czechoslovak Embassy in China, as well as experts, professors, and students from Czechoslovakia and cultural officials and foreign peace activists from many countries' embassies attended the commemorative meeting.

    北京集会纪念捷教育家考门斯基
    大会开始时为捷总统逝世默哀
    据新华社15日讯　世界文化名人、捷克伟大的教育家扬·阿莫斯·考门斯基（夸美纽斯）纪念大会今晚在北京举行。今年是夸美纽斯的伟大著作“教育论著全集”出版三百周年，11月15日是他逝世的日子。
    纪念大会由中国人民保卫世界和平委员会、中国人民对外文化协会、中国科学院、教育科学研究所、中国作家协会五个团体联合举办。
    纪念大会开始时，全体起立为捷克斯洛伐克总统萨波托斯基的逝世默哀一分钟。
    中国人民保卫世界和平委员会常务委员、中国人民对外文化协会常务理事张奚若在纪念大会上致开幕词。他说，夸美纽斯首先是以一个伟大的教育家为世人所景仰的。但他不仅是一个教育家，而且是一个思想家、社会政治活动家。他是一个民主主义者、人道主义者、爱国主义者，同时他也是一个提倡世界和平、国际合作的国际主义者。
    张奚若说，夸美纽斯的名字，对中国人民是不生疏的。在九十多年前，当中国开始推行现代化的教育的时候，伟大教育家夸美纽斯的名字传入了中国。他的经典著作“大教学论”在1939年被译成了中文。
    张奚若说，我们纪念夸美纽斯首先就是为了他对人类的教育事业所作出的伟大和杰出的贡献。我们纪念夸美纽斯，同时因为他是世界和平运动的先驱。他在三百多年之前，就开始了世界和平、国际合作理想的倡导。
    从捷克斯洛伐克远道赶来参加纪念大会的捷教育家埃尔文·库卡耳博士在会上作了题为“扬·阿莫斯·考门斯基是为教育和社会改革而斗争的战士”的报告。他说，夸美纽斯不仅是捷克民族杰出的人物，而且也被认为是近代初期的世界闻名的杰出的思想家和改革家。夸美纽斯是活在全世界进步人类的心里的，因为他的和社会改革紧密联系的教育思想远远超越了他生活的十七世纪的历史范围，而只有在未来的社会主义社会才提供实现这种教育思想的有利条件。埃尔文·库卡耳博士在介绍了夸美纽斯作为一个杰出的思想家和改革家的形象以后指出，夸美纽斯为和平与全面改革所作的努力，目的在于争取一个“没有弱肉强食的野兽，没有嫁战祸于人的恶魔，没有损人利己胡作非为的歹徒”的社会。
    埃尔文·库卡耳博士还代表捷克斯洛伐克文化教育工作者把一部夸美纽斯的“大教学论”赠送给中国教育工作者。
    纪念大会上，中国教育科学研究所研究员曹孚作了“扬·阿莫斯·考门斯基（夸美纽斯）的生命和思想”的报告。
    会上宣读了捷克斯洛伐克科学院夸美纽斯研究所致大会的贺电。
    会后，中国演员朗诵了扬·阿莫斯·考门斯基的小说的片断“军情”，正在这里访问的捷克斯洛伐克音乐家代表团还演出了斯美塔那、德沃夏克等人的名曲。
    出席纪念大会的有中国人民对外文化协会会长楚图南、中国人民保卫世界和平委员会常务委员邵力子等八百多人。
    捷克斯洛伐克驻中国大使馆参赞瓦塞克和在华专家、教授、留学生，以及许多国家使馆的文化官员和外国和平人士出席了纪念会。
