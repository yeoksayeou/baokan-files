To the Editorial Department of "Pravda":

Dear Comrades,

During our stay in your great country as members of the delegation of the People's Republic of China to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution, we received a large number of letters and telegrams from Soviet citizens, some of which were accompanied by precious gifts. These letters, telegrams, and gifts enthusiastically expressed the most sincere brotherly friendship and best wishes of the Soviet people towards the Chinese people, towards the delegation of the People's Republic of China and its members, and towards me personally. We regard this feeling of the Soviet people as a symbol of the unbreakable great friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people. Because it is difficult for me and my comrades to reply to so many letters and telegrams one by one, please allow us, through your newspaper, to convey our heartfelt gratitude from the 600 million Chinese people, all the comrades of the delegation of the People's Republic of China, and myself personally to the Soviet people, to all the Soviet comrades who gave us these letters, telegrams, and gifts.

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Mao Zedong
