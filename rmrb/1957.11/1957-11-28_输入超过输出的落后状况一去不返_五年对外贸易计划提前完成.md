Xinhua News Agency, November 27th: Xinhua News Agency reporter Zhang Zhiqing reports: China's first Five-Year Plan for foreign trade has been completed two months ahead of schedule. By the end of October this year, the import and export plan had been fulfilled by 102.74%, with imports completing 105.07% and exports completing 100.27%. During the first Five-Year Plan period, China's imports and exports were balanced, fundamentally changing the sluggish situation in old China where imports long exceeded exports.

In recent years, China's foreign trade relations have been increasingly consolidated and developed. To date, China has traded with eighty-two countries and regions, of which twenty-three countries have signed intergovernmental trade agreements with China. During the first Five-Year Plan period, China's imports and exports to the Soviet Union and other People's Democratic countries accounted for 77.9% of China's total import and export volume; the trade volume with Asian and African countries is expected to increase by 88.5% by the end of 1957 compared to 1950; trade with Western capitalist countries has also increased year by year.

Over the past four years, thanks to the development of China's industrial and agricultural production and the attention paid by Party and government departments at all levels, the quantity and variety of export commodities have increased. In addition to minerals, native products, animal products, food, handicrafts, and various traditional export commodities, many new industrial products have been added to exports with the rapid development of China's industrial production. For example, complete sets of equipment for textile factories, cement plants, and paper mills, general machinery and machine tools, steel, as well as wool fabrics, fountain pens, thermos bottles, sewing machines, radios, etc., have only been exported since liberation. The export of these materials has guaranteed the import of machinery and equipment and related materials necessary for China's industrialization.

During the first Five-Year Plan period, more than sixty large-scale enterprises designed and equipped with the help of the Soviet Union will be put into production by the end of this year. The Eastern European People's Democratic countries will also be able to complete the supply of thirty-three sets of equipment. The completion of these enterprises has an extremely important role in China's socialist industrialization. At the same time, China has imported a considerable amount of other machinery, materials, and people's consumer goods. The import of these materials has played an important role in the rapid development of China's industrial and agricultural production and in regulating domestic market supply.

    输入超过输出的落后状况一去不返
    五年对外贸易计划提前完成
    据新华社27日讯　新华社记者张志清报道：我国对外贸易第一个五年计划已经提前两个月完成。截至今年10月底止，进出口计划完成102．74％，其中进口完成105．07％，出口完成100．27％。第一个五年计划期间我国输入同输出是平衡的，根本改变了旧中国输入长期超过输出的不景气状况。
    几年来，我国对外贸易关系日益巩固和发展，到目前止，我国同八十二个国家和地区进行了贸易，其中有二十三个国家同我国签订了政府间的贸易协定。在第一个五年计划期间，我国对苏联和各人民民主国家的进出口额占我国进出口总额的77．9％；对亚非国家的贸易额，预计1957年底比1950年增长88．5％；对西方资本主义国家的贸易也逐年有所增长。
    四年多以来，由于我国工农业生产的发展和各级党政部门的重视，出口商品的数量和品种都有增加。出口商品中除了有矿产品、土产品、畜产品、食品、手工艺品和各种传统出口商品以外，随着我国工业生产的迅速发展，还增加了许多新工业品出口。比如纺织工厂、水泥厂、造纸厂的全套设备，一般机械和机床，钢材，以及呢绒、自来水笔、暖水瓶、缝纫机、收音机等等，都是解放以后才出口的。这些物资的出口，保证了我国实现工业化所必需的机器设备和有关物资的进口。
    第一个五年计划期内，苏联帮助我国设计和供应设备的各项规模巨大的企业，到今年年底将有六十多项投入生产。东欧各人民民主国家也将能够完成三十三项成套设备的供应。这些企业的建成，对于我国的社会主义工业化有着极其重大的作用。同时我国进口了相当大量的其他的机器、材料和人民生活用品。这些物资的进口，对于我国工农业生产的迅速发展和调剂国内市场供应起了重要的作用。
