Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, November 20th. Fifty thousand people of all ethnic groups in the Ailao Mountains on the southern border of Yunnan Province celebrated the establishment of the Honghe Hani and Yi Autonomous Prefecture in Yunnan Province. On the 19th, the streets and alleys of Mengzi, the capital of the autonomous prefecture, were decorated with lanterns and colored banners, and the crowds were bustling. At noon, 50,000 people of all ethnic groups poured into the square where the conference was held. This was the first time in the history of Mengzi that so many people had gathered. The Miao and Yao people who live on the top of the Ailao Mountains, the Hani and Yi people who live on the mountainside, the Dai people who live along the Honghe River, and the Kucong people who have just migrated from the primeval forests on the border line, gathered together today to listen to the congratulatory message delivered by Xia Kangnong on behalf of the Central Nationalities Affairs Commission. This voice from Beijing evoked thunderous applause, thanking the motherland for its care and congratulations to the people of the border areas. People of all ethnic groups and overseas Vietnamese residing in the autonomous prefecture also welcomed the congratulatory message and the presentation of a banner from Le Songshan, the Consul of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in Kunming, who was invited by the preparatory committee of the autonomous prefecture to attend the conference. The autonomous prefecture has more than 400 kilometers of border line adjacent to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and the historic friendship between the people on the Sino-Vietnamese border has once again been sincerely reflected today.
    At the conference, people of all ethnic groups also presented the carefully made JianShui pottery, the peacock symbolizing happiness, and many other special products from the autonomous prefecture to Chairman Mao and the State Council, and to Le Songshan, the Consul of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in Kunming, to express the love of the 1.4 million people of all ethnic groups in the Honghe border area for the motherland, Chairman Mao, and international friends.
    When countless colorful balloons rose slowly into the sky and the conference ended amidst the deafening sound of firecrackers, the sea of people was filled with joy. Hani men and women danced the Luozo dance, the Axi people, famous for their heroic armed resistance against the Kuomintang reactionary rulers, played the huge three-stringed instrument as tall as a person, the Miao people played the Lusheng, and the Han people danced the golden long dragon, writhing and tumbling.

    庆祝红河哈尼族彝族自治州成立
    哀牢山下五万各族人民集会
    据新华社昆明20日电　滇南边疆哀牢山下五万各族人民欢庆云南省红河哈尼族彝族自治州的成立。19日，自治州首府蒙自街头巷尾到处张灯结彩，人群熙攘。中午，五万各族人民从四面八方涌到举行大会的广场。有这么多人集会，在蒙自历史上还是第一次。居住在哀牢山顶的苗人和瑶人，居住在山腰的哈尼人和彝人，居住在红河沿岸的傣人和刚从国境线上原始森林里迁移出来的苦聪人，今天汇合一起共同倾听着夏康农代表中央民族事务委员会致的贺词。这来自北京的声音唤起春雷般掌声，感谢祖国对边疆人民的关怀和祝贺。各族人民和侨居自治州的越侨，还欢迎应自治州筹备委员会邀请前来参加大会的越南民主共和国驻昆明领事黎松山的致贺和赠送贺幛。自治州有四百多公里国境线和越南民主共和国接壤，中越边境人民的历史性友谊今天又一次得到真挚的反映。
    大会上，各族人民还把精心制作的著名建水陶器，象征幸福的孔雀等许多自治州境内的特产献给毛主席和国务院，赠给越南民主共和国驻昆明领事黎松山，表达红河边疆一百四十多万各族人民热爱祖国，热爱毛主席和热爱国际友人的心意。
    当天空冉冉升起无数彩色气球，在震天价鞭炮声中结束大会时，人海中欢乐一片、哈尼族男女跳起罗佐舞，曾以英勇武装反抗国民党反动统治者著名的阿细人弹起一人高的大三弦，苗族人民吹起芦笙，汉族人民舞起扑腾翻滚金色的长龙。
