Righteousness Overwhelms Evil
By our reporter Jin Yukun

Rampant Individualistic Evil

Since last year, and especially in the first half of this year, the Shenyang High-Voltage Switch Factory has witnessed a very serious phenomenon of lax discipline in its workshops. Workers chatting and loafing around during work hours, disobeying production commands, not sticking to their work posts, washing up and getting ready to leave before time, and arbitrary absenteeism and tardiness were extremely common among some young workers. Li Yuwu's backward small group in the complete equipment workshop, who called themselves "Four Great Uncles," deliberately engaged in collective slowdowns during urgent tasks, confronting the section and workshop leaders. Even more seriously, incidents of beating and scolding foremen and workshop directors occurred repeatedly in several workshops. The medium-voltage workshop saw four such incidents in three months. Cao Wensheng, a worker in the high-voltage workshop, refused work assigned by the foreman, and when the foreman decided to treat it as absenteeism and not issue attendance pay, Cao Wensheng violently beat the foreman.

The factory's labor discipline is so lax mainly because the evil of individualistic thinking has overwhelmed righteousness among the workers. According to investigations, 90% of the labor discipline violations among young workers with poor discipline are caused by dissatisfaction with piece rates, quotas, wages, and other issues. Some young workers, in order to earn more wages, circulate so-called "three not to do," "four not to do," and "five not to do": "Won't do it if I can't learn technology, won't do it if I earn little money, won't do it if it's dirty, won't do it if it's tiring," and even "won't do it if there's little profit, won't do it if it's a new product, won't do it if it's precise, won't do it if the batch is small, won't do it if I don't get a precision machine," and so on. In order to earn more piece-rate wages, they don't pay attention to product quality, secretly alter work hours, and falsely report more work done to fraudulently obtain piece-rate wages. They work hard during piecework, but loaf on the job during hourly work, which workers describe as: "Work like crazy for piece-rate wages, and like in a nursing home for hourly wages." When accepting quotas, they often pick and choose, haggle, and argue endlessly. More than 80% of the workers in the high-voltage workshop try to push off jobs that are not easy to exceed the quota on to the next shift, which often affects the entire task. Some workers even destroy state property to vent personal anger when their personal interests cannot be satisfied. For example, Zheng Changshi, a worker in the medium-voltage workshop, processed parts that did not meet specifications and was not entitled to piece-rate wages according to regulations, but the parts could still be repaired and used. However, in a fit of anger, he raised a hammer and smashed the parts. The value of this part was equal to one and a half months of his wages. Similar behavior occurred three times in this workshop in May alone.

Some veteran workers and production activists have long been very dissatisfied with this phenomenon.

Why is discipline so lax?

The Party Committee of the Shenyang High-Voltage Switch Factory conducted an investigation and analysis of the above situation and believes that since last year, the evil of individualism has become so rampant in the enterprise due to the influence of right-wing elements in society, and mainly for these two reasons:

First, a large increase in non-working-class components within the factory. Due to the expansion of personnel in recent years, and the continuous transfer of original veteran workers to support new factories or to be promoted to cadres, veteran workers account for only about 10% of the production workers, while young workers account for 90%. Among the young workers, only 30% are from working-class families. Among the 70% from non-working-class families, 40% are students from exploiting classes and petty bourgeoisie. The situation for workers who entered the factory in 1956 is even more prominent, with only about 3% from working-class families, while students from exploiting classes and petty bourgeoisie accounted for 74%. (In addition, a considerable number of landlords, capitalists, rich peasants, and puppet police were mixed into the factory.) The characteristics of these young people are: they have a preliminary cultural foundation, are more sensitive to accepting new things, master technology faster, are young and strong, and are very intense when working. However, they lack production experience, and more importantly, lack the training of political struggle, are not disciplined, are not highly conscious, and have a strong non-working-class consciousness. The vast majority, even 100%, of those who violate labor discipline are young people under the age of twenty-five. When they entered the factory, the democratic reform of the factory had ended, and the class struggle had basically passed. They neither suffered from class oppression and class exploitation, nor caught up with the political movement to carry out education in this area. Some people have not even received basic political enlightenment education. Although they have joined the ranks of the working class, their minds are filled with all kinds of individualism.

Second, facing this new situation, the factory's Party organization lacked sufficient attention to strengthening political and ideological work in this area; at the same time, after the factory emphasized concern for the material interests of employees last year, there was a bias towards only paying attention to material incentives, and political and ideological work was invisibly weakened. Therefore, the result is that many young people rarely care about politics and national interests, but are very concerned about personal interests, and their minds are full of how to get promoted, earn more wages, and get more rewards. Some people only participate in competitions for a few yuan of bonus, and go home in anger if they are not awarded a prize. When the factory organizes voluntary labor, they say: "Consider money as one share." They say: entering the factory "isn't it for RMB," "to support the wife and children." In the first year of entering the factory, when they do not have the capital in terms of technology, these people are relatively honest. After some time, after they master the technology, their wings begin to harden, and they begin to become arrogant. At this time, they have not received timely criticism and education from the leadership, so they develop more and more seriously. As a result, they disrespect veteran workers, do not observe labor discipline, do not obey production commands, make trouble, and the evil spirit rises.

Starting with criticizing individualism

Since the lax labor discipline is due to the rampant individualism, to rectify labor discipline, it is necessary to start with criticizing and overcoming individualistic thinking.

The Shenyang High-Voltage Switch Factory’s education to rectify labor discipline is carried out as a part of the socialist education movement in the enterprise.

The main method is to rely on mass self-education led by veteran workers. At the beginning, the Party Committee organized people to give four lectures, talking about issues such as democracy and centralism, freedom and discipline, and personal interests and national interests. However, relying solely on lectures cannot have a deeper impact. Therefore, the Party Committee decided to have each workshop find veteran workers to give personal accounts. One method is for veteran workers to serve as lecturers and give reports; another method is to organize young people to visit veteran workers' homes. The complete equipment workshop invited forty-two-year-old veteran worker Comrade Tong Xinhe to give lectures to all the workers in the workshop. He talked about how difficult it was to learn a little technology when he was an apprentice, even stealing to learn was difficult. As soon as he got close to the master, the master would erase what he had calculated. The master would not be happy if he stood in front of him for a long time and would always find a way to send him away, sometimes asking him to pour a bowl of water, and sometimes asking him to get something. When he came back, he couldn't see what he wanted to see. In the old society, the master also had his own difficulties, as the saying goes: "Teach the apprentice, starve the master." Now, the apprentices can't even imagine these things. At that time, after learning for three years, one actually learned nothing, but now one can master the technology in three months, and still have to sign a contract to guarantee teaching and learning! In the past, it was good enough for apprentices to live in a mat shed; now the young people live in large buildings as soon as they come, with tap water and heating. He said: "But now some young people do not understand these things. The more their lives improve, the more their thinking declines. They only know how to be comfortable, how to earn more money. They are really not content with their blessings, and they don't look like the working class!" Everyone nodded in agreement with what he said.

In the medium-voltage workshop, the secretary of the Youth League branch led young people who usually did not pay attention to labor discipline to visit the home of veteran worker Su Yuyan. As soon as they entered the house, they saw that the Su's house was decorated very well. Some people touched the radio and asked, "How much did this cost?" Some said enviously, "This little house is so good!" Comrade Su continued: "Now you see that this room is full of radios, bicycles, and wall clocks, but the past life was really a world apart..." He began to tell these young people about his tragic life in the old society: His father was a bricklayer, and unfortunately broke his leg while repairing a building. Because he had no money to treat it, he rotted to death on the bed. His two brothers, sisters-in-law, and mother also suffered similar fates. Seven of his family of nine were tortured to death in the old society. He said: Now young people only know how to live a good life, but they don't know how the good life came about. He encouraged the young people to take on the responsibilities of the working class during the construction period. This sincere persuasion moved the young people to tears.

After the veteran workers gave their personal accounts, the workshop organized workers to hold discussions. Some said: "We are young and haven't experienced these things. What the veteran workers say is true. It was really not easy to be a worker in the old society." "We are used to living in happiness, but we have lost the feeling of happiness. It is truly 'difficult to know the sweetness without suffering,' and instead, we become more and more dissatisfied. Fortunately, after this lecture from the veteran workers, it really was a profound lesson." The young workers checked their past shortcomings and denounced those who had consistently and seriously violated labor discipline, expressing great anger and actively requesting the leadership to resolutely and conscientiously rectify labor discipline.

In order to achieve the goal of educating all the factory's employees, the factory leadership decided to launch mass denunciation and criticism against the forty-two people in the factory who had seriously violated labor discipline. At the meeting, the workers generally expressed that they could not tolerate this behavior. When the complete equipment workshop criticized Li Yuwu, the workers handed in dozens of slips of paper, demanding that he be immediately suspended from his duties and reflect. If he did not sincerely and thoroughly correct himself, he would be kicked out of the ranks of the working class. Those who were criticized saw that the masses were very determined, and if they did not truly correct themselves, it would be difficult to gain everyone's understanding, so they made a more profound self-examination in front of the masses. There were also individual people who persisted in their mistakes. For example, Shan Guangru, a worker in the public service workshop, openly walked away in anger when he was criticized at the meeting. The workshop leadership talked to him, but he didn't even listen. The factory was preparing to expel him from the factory. After hearing the news, he ran to the Party branch and wept bitterly and made a self-examination. At the same time as the mass criticism struggle, the leading comrades also conducted individual talks, striving for their parents, wives, neighbors, and family committee to assist in education. These methods also played a great role in helping them recognize their mistakes.

Many employees began to realize in the discussion that if the relationship between the individual and the collective is not properly handled, it will not only affect the interests of the country and the unity of the working class, but also affect the interests and future of the individual. Wang Zhiyuan, a worker in the medium-voltage workshop, reviewed and said: He used to value personal interests too much, and always felt that his wages were low. If he was not given a wage increase, he would not work hard. At its worst, he could only complete 50% of the task. This education awakened him. He sadly said: I have been making trouble over personal interests all day long, which has not only caused irreparable losses to the interests of the country, but is also detrimental to the individual. If this continues, I don't know where I will degenerate to! In the discussion, everyone also realized that the better they serve the national interests and wholeheartedly put their efforts into production, the result will not only benefit the country, but also solve the problem of personal interests. Li Yuwu, from the complete equipment workshop, used to make a lot of noise about personal interests, but in fact, he did not earn much, only a few yuan of piece-rate wages per month. After the change in thinking, he worked without raising his head for several hours, often exceeding the quota by one or two times. His monthly piece-rate wages were twenty or thirty yuan more than in the past.

Socialist Righteousness Overwhelms Evil

After the Shenyang High-Voltage Switch Factory rectified labor discipline, new atmospheres generally appeared in the workshops: The phenomena of arriving late and leaving early, loafing around, and washing hands half an hour in advance have basically disappeared; The phenomenon of disobeying the foreman's assignments has disappeared. In the past, some workshops could not be managed by three foremen on the night shift, but now one foreman is enough; The phenomenon of unreasonably arguing about quota issues in the workshop office in groups of three or five has disappeared. The phenomenon of quota staff and workers quarreling has been basically eliminated; The attendance rate has also increased significantly. In the past, the attendance rate after holidays was generally only 80% to 90%, but after this year's National Day, the attendance rate of the entire factory reached 98%, and some workshops reached 100%.

With the evil of individualism suppressed, the righteousness in the factory has greatly increased. In the past, veteran workers were often bullied in the workshop, but now veteran workers are the most respected in the workshop. There is only one veteran worker in the electroplating workshop named Deng Yutang. In the past, he couldn't stand the behavior of the young workers and often used the situation in the old society as a metaphor to persuade them. But the young workers hated him and said, "What are you talking about these stinky theories? The past is the past, today is today. Who told you to be born in the old society? You deserve it!" Comrade Deng was often so angry that he trembled. After this education, now the young workers go to ask him for advice when they have problems, and they always call Comrade Deng "Comrade Deng." In the past, no one cared about others violating labor discipline, but now the mass supervision is very strict. In the medium-voltage workshop, individual workers who washed their hands and ate early immediately had big-character posters criticizing them. Li Yuwu and Lu Jun, who often violated labor discipline in the past, now criticize others if they see them standing idly by their machine tools. Occasionally, incidents of fraudulently obtaining piece-rate wages are immediately exposed by others. Mass criticism and self-criticism has also begun to become a habit for the workers.

Everyone reflected that such rectification was very good. Veteran workers said: "If we don't rectify, there will be no one to work! What kind of factory is that! It's a good rectification!" The young workers said: "Although we are also a member of the working class, we didn't even know what the working class was doing in the past. If it weren't for this education, it would have been terrible to think about it!" Because the workers consciously abide by discipline, the difficulties in production command have been greatly reduced, and the management cadres have said that they support it.

    正气压倒了邪气

    个人主义邪气泛滥
    沈阳高压开关厂从去年以来，特别是在今年上半年，车间里出现了一种极为严重的纪律涣散的现象。工作时间嘻嘻哈哈、溜溜跶跶，不服从生产指挥，不坚守工作岗位，不到时间就洗手整装，任意旷工迟到等等现象，在部分青年工人中极为普遍。成套车间自称为“四大爷”的李玉武落后小集团，在任务紧急时故意集体怠工，与工段和车间领导对抗。更严重的是，打骂工长和车间主任的事件也在几个车间里屡次发生。中压车间在三个月中就发生了四次。高压车间工人曹文胜拒绝工长分配的工作，工长决定按旷工处理不发出勤工资，曹文胜竟蛮横地将工长痛打了一顿。
    工厂的劳动纪律所以如此涣散，主要原因是工人中个人主义思想的邪气压倒了正气。据调查，在劳动纪律不好的青年工人中，有90％的违反劳动纪律的行为是由于对计件、定额、工资等问题不满而引起的。有些青年工人为多得工资，流传着所谓“三不干”“四不干”“五不干”：“学不到技术不干，挣钱少不干，脏的不干，累的不干”，还有什么“油水少不干，新产品不干，精密的不干，批量少的不干，不给精密床子不干”等等。为了多得计件工资，不注意产品质量，偷改工时、以少报多骗取计件工资的事情也时有发生。做计件活时拚命突击，在计时工作中却磨洋工，工人形容为：“计件工资拚命干，计时工资养老院”。在接受定额时，往往挑肥拣瘦，讨价还价，争吵不休。高压车间有80％以上的工人遇到了不易超额的活，就想办法推出去，这一班推到下一班，结果往往影响了整个任务。更有的工人在个人利益不能得到满足时，竟不惜破坏国家财产以泄私愤。如中压车间工人郑长史加工的零件不合规格，按规定不能得计件工资，但是零件还可以回修使用。但他在一气之下，竟举起榔头把零件砸碎了。这个零件的价值等于他一个半月的工资。与此同样的行为，5月份在这个车间竟连续发生了三起。
    一些老工人和生产积极分子，对这种现象早就很不满意。
    纪律为什么如此涣散？
    沈阳高压开关厂的党委会对上述情况作了调查分析，认为从去年以来，个人主义的邪气在企业中所以如此泛滥，除受社会上右派分子的影响外，主要的有这样两个原因：
    第一，工厂内部非工人阶级成分大量增加。由于近数年企业扩充人员，原有老工人又不断抽调支援新厂或提升为干部，因此老工人在生产工人中仅占10％左右，青年工人却占了90％。而在青年工人中，出身于工人家庭的仅30％，在70％出身于非工人家庭的青年中，有40％是出身于剥削阶级和小资产阶级的学生。1956年入厂工人的情况更为突出，出身于工人家庭的仅占3％左右，而出身于剥削阶级和小资产阶级的学生却达74％。（此外还有相当一部分地主、资本家、富农、伪警宪混进了工厂。）这些青年的特点是：由于具备了初步的文化基础，接受新事物比较敏锐，掌握技术较快，年青力壮，手脚灵敏，劳动起来强度很高。但是他们缺乏生产经验，更主要的是缺乏政治斗争的锻炼，纪律性不强，觉悟不高，非工人阶级意识相当浓厚。违犯劳动纪律的人，绝大部分、甚至百分之百是二十五岁以下的青年。他们入厂时，工厂民主改革已经结束，阶级斗争已基本上过去，他们既没有身受阶级压迫和阶级剥削之苦，又没有赶上进行这方面教育的政治运动。有些人甚至连基本的政治启蒙教育都没受过。他们虽然参加了工人阶级的队伍，但是脑子里却充满了形形色色的个人主义。
    第二，面临这一新的情况，工厂党组织对加强这方面的政治思想工作缺乏足够的注意；同时去年工厂里强调了关心职工物质利益后，又出现了只注意物质刺激的偏向，政治思想工作无形中更加削弱。因此就形成：不少青年很少关心政治和国家利益，对个人利益却斤斤较量，满脑子是如何晋级、多得工资、多得奖励。有的人只为得几元奖金参加竞赛，评不上奖就一怒回家。厂里组织义务劳动，他们说：“有钱就算一份”。他们说：进工厂“还不是为了人民币”，“为了养活老婆孩子”。入厂头一年，技术上还没有本钱，这些人还比较老实。过一些时候，掌握了技术，翅膀开始硬起来，人也就开始骄傲起来。这时候，又没有得到领导方面及时的批判教育，因此就发展得越来越严重。于是不尊重老师傅，不遵守劳动纪律，不服从生产指挥，闹这闹那，邪气高涨。
    从批判个人主义着手
    由于劳动纪律的涣散是因为个人主义思想的泛滥，因此要整顿劳动纪律就必须从批判和克服个人主义思想着手。
    沈阳高压开关厂整顿劳动纪律的教育，是作为企业社会主义教育运动的一项内容来进行的。
    进行的方式主要是依靠老工人为主的群众性的自我教育。开始时，先由党委组织人讲了四次课，讲了民主与集中、自由和纪律、个人利益和国家利益等问题。但是仅仅依靠上课，并不能发生更深刻的影响。因此党委又决定由各车间物色老工人进行现身说法，一种方式是由老工人任讲师作报告；一种方式是组织青年到老工人家里访问。成套车间请四十二岁的老工人——佟新和老师傅给全车间工人讲课。他讲他当学徒的时候，要学点技术真是不易，偷着学都困难，一到师傅跟前，师傅就把计算好的东西擦掉了。在师傅跟前站得久一点，师傅就不乐意，总要想办法把你支使开，一会叫你倒碗水，又要你拿个东西，等你回来，要看的就看不到了。旧社会的师傅也有他的苦处，俗语说：“教会徒弟，饿死师傅”。现在当徒弟的，这些事情连想都想不到。那时，学三年，实际上也学不到什么，而现在三个月就能掌握技术，还得订什么合同得包教保学哩！过去，当学徒的能住上席棚就算不错；现在年青的一来就住上大楼，自来水暖气都全。他说：“但是现在有些小年青的，却不了解这些。他们生活越提高，思想越降低，就知道怎么自在，怎么多赚钱，真是身在福中不知福，哪像个工人阶级的样子！”他这番话说得大家都点头称是。
    在中压车间，团支部书记带领了平时不太注意劳动纪律的青年，去老工人肃玉衍家里访问。一进屋，就看到肃师傅家里摆设得特别好，有的人就摸摸收音机问：“这是多少钱买的？”有的羡慕地说：“这小屋太好了！”肃师傅接着说：“现在你们看这屋里收音机、自行车、挂钟啥都全，可是过去的日子和这真是天差地远呀……”。他对这群年青人讲开了他在旧社会的凄惨生活：他的父亲是一个瓦工，在修楼时不幸摔断了腿，因为没钱治，活活烂死在床上。他的两个哥哥、嫂子、母亲也都遭受了类似的命运，一家九口人，在旧社会就被折磨死了七口。他说：现在年青人只知道过好日子，却不知道好日子是怎么来的。他勉励年青人要好好担负起建设时期工人阶级的责任来。这番诚恳的劝导把青年人都感动得哭了。
    老工人现身说法以后，车间里就组织工人座谈讨论。有的说：“咱们年岁小，没经过这些，老师傅说的都是事实，旧社会当工人真不易。”“咱们在幸福中生活惯了，却对幸福生活失去了感觉，真是‘不吃苦中苦，难知甜中甜’，反而越过越不知足。好得经老师傅这一讲，真是上了一堂深刻的课”。青年工人们纷纷检查自己过去的缺点，并对一些一贯严重违犯劳动纪律的人进行揭发，表示非常气愤，主动要求领导上坚决认真整顿劳动纪律。
    为达到教育全厂职工的目的，厂领导上决定对全厂四十二名严重违犯劳动纪律的人，展开群众性的揭发和批判。在会上，职工群众普遍表示对这种行为不能容忍，成套车间批判李玉武时，工人递上了几十张条子，要求马上让他停职反省，如果他不认真彻底改正，就把他撵出工人阶级的队伍。被批判的人看到群众的决心很大，如不真正改正就难于取得大家的谅解，因而都在群众面前作了较深刻的检查。也有个别的人坚持错误。如公用车间工人单广儒，在开会批判他时竟公然拂袖而去，车间领导找他谈话连听都不听。工厂就准备把他开除出厂。他听到风声后，跑到党支部痛哭流涕作了检查。在群众性的批判斗争的同时，领导同志还进行了个别谈话，争取他们的父母、妻子、邻居和家属委员会协助教育，这些方式对帮助他们认识错误也都有很大作用。
    许多职工在讨论中，开始认识到个人与集体的关系如不能正确处理，不仅影响国家利益和工人阶级的团结，而且也影响到个人的利益和前途。中压车间工人王志元检讨说：他过去对个人利益看得太重，总嫌自己的工资低，不给涨工资，就不好好干，严重时只能完成任务50％，这次教育使他惊醒过来，他沉痛地说：我整天闹个人利益，不仅使国家利益遭到不可弥补的损失，而且对个人也是不利的。如果长此下去，真不知要堕落到那里去了！在讨论中，大家也认识到了：越是更好地服从国家利益，全心全意放在生产上，结果不仅对国家有利，而且也解决了个人利益问题。成套车间李玉武过去个人利益闹得挺凶，但实际上并没有多挣多少，每月只能得几元钱计件工资。思想转变后，干起活来几个钟头不抬头，经常超额一两倍。每月的计件工资比过去要多得二、三十元。
    社会主义正气压倒邪气
    沈阳高压开关厂整顿劳动纪律以后，在车间里普遍出现了新气象：迟到早退、溜溜跶跶、提前半小时洗手的现象基本上没有了；工长派活不服从的现象没有了，过去有的车间夜三班有三个工长管不过来，现在一个工长尽够了；为定额问题在车间办公室三五成群无理取闹的现象没有了，定额员和工人吵架的现象已基本消灭；出勤率也显著提高了，过去假日后一般出勤率仅能达到80％到90％，今年国庆节后全厂出勤率达到98％，有的车间达到了100％。
    个人主义邪气被压倒，工厂里正气大大抬头。过去老工人在车间里经常受气，现在老工人在车间最受人尊敬。电镀车间只有一个老工人叫邓玉堂，过去看不惯青年工人的作为，常爱拿旧社会的情况来作比喻，劝导他们。但是青工都很讨厌他，说他：“老讲这些臭理论干啥？过去是过去，今天是今天，谁叫你生在旧社会，活该！”常常把邓师傅气得发抖。经过这次教育后，现在青年工人有问题都去请教他，老是邓师傅长邓师傅短的。过去旁人违犯劳动纪律谁也不管，现在群众性的监督很严格。中压车间个别工人提前洗手吃饭，马上有人贴出大字报批评。过去经常违反劳动纪律的李玉武、陆浚等，现在看见别人没事站到他们的机床跟前，就要提出批评。偶尔发生骗取计件工资的事情，也马上会遭到别人揭发。群众性的批评自我批评也已开始成为工人们的习惯。
    这样整顿，大家都反映很好。老工人说：“再不整顿，发展下去就要没有干活的人了！那还叫什么工厂！整得好！”青年工人说：“我们虽然也算是工人阶级一分子，但是过去连工人阶级是干啥的都不知道，要没有这次教育，想想真是不得了！”由于工人自觉遵守纪律，生产指挥上的困难大大减少，管理干部更是拥护说好。
