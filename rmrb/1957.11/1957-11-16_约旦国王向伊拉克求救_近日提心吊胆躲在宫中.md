Xinhua News Agency, Amman, 15th: Jordanian King Hussein spent his twenty-third birthday on the 14th living in fear.

    Troops equipped with machine guns guarded the palace, preparing for possible attacks. The whole country remains under martial law. Hussein is now living deep in his mother's palace, as it is easier to defend. It is reported that 1,200 carefully selected men have been formed into a guard to protect the King, equipped with new American guns and British tanks.
    According to UPI, Western observers believe that Hussein can only get support from about 300,000 of Jordan's 1.5 million people.
    Hussein is asking his cousin, Iraqi King Faisal, to support him. In a letter to Iraqi religious leaders on the 13th, Faisal attacked Arab countries that condemned the Jordanian King on radio broadcasts.
    Agence France-Presse, Baghdad, 14th: Citing well-informed sources, the Iraqi government has asked the Egyptian government to pay attention to the "seriousness" of Egyptian newspapers and radio stations accusing the Jordanian government and King.
    These sources revealed that the Iraqi government threatened the Egyptian ambassador to Iraq that if Hussein made a request, the Iraqi-Jordanian treaty signed in 1947, which stipulated mutual assistance, would be fully implemented.
    According to Agence France-Presse, Iraqi officials believe that the fact that troops are stationed at all important road junctions in Jordan is a sign of an impending crisis that could endanger the Jordanian regime and the court.
    These officials said that Jordan now seems to be divided into two parts. On the one hand, there is King Hussein and his cabinet, who adopt a firm anti-communist and pro-American attitude, and on the other hand, there are the masses. They threatened that Iraq could not stand idly by as the situation evolved.

    约旦国王向伊拉克求救
    近日提心吊胆躲在宫中
    新华社15日讯　安曼消息：约旦国王侯赛因14日提心吊胆地度过了他的二十三岁生日。
    配备着机关枪的军队守卫着王宫，防备可能的袭击。全国继续处在戒严令下。侯赛因现在深居在太后的宫中，因为那里易于保卫。据报道，已经精选了一千二百人组成保护国王的卫队，他们将配备新式的美国枪和英国坦克。
    据合众社说，西方观察家认为在约旦一百五十万人口中，侯赛因大约只能得到三十万人的支持。
    侯赛因正要求他的堂兄弟伊拉克国王费萨尔为他撑腰。费萨尔13日在给伊拉克宗教领袖的信中，攻击了那些在电台广播中谴责约旦国王的阿拉伯国家。
    法新社巴格达14日消息援引消息灵通人士的谈话说，伊拉克政府已经请埃及政府注意埃及报纸和电台指责约旦政府和国王的“严重性”。
    这些人士透露，伊拉克政府向埃及驻伊拉克大使威胁说，如果侯赛因提出要求， 1947年签订的规定互相援助的伊拉克—约旦条约将充分付诸实施。
    法新社消息说，伊拉克官方人士认为，约旦一切重要道路的交叉点上都驻扎了部队这个事实，是一个就要发生危机的迹象，这次危机可能危及约旦政权和宫廷。
    这些人士说，约旦现在似乎分成了两部分。一方面是侯赛因国王和他的内阁，他们采取一种坚决反共亲美的态度，而另一方面是人民群众。他们威胁说，伊拉克对局势演变不能袖手旁观。
