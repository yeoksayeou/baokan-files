Xinjiang's Diverse and Rich Folk Sports Activities

(By our newspaper) Rural mass sports activities in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region have developed relatively quickly. In the Yanqi Hui Autonomous County, thirty-four teams exist within nine townships. In Xinyuan County, a medium-sized wrestling competition takes place every three days. In the Qapqal Xibe Autonomous County, Section Three, Township One, many farmers regularly practice archery after work. In the Weihu Agricultural Cooperative in Hutubi County, over two hundred members regularly participate in volleyball. The seventeen agricultural cooperatives in the three counties of Turpan, Shanshan, and Toksun have also held peasant sports meets. Toksun County held a speed horse race this year, mainly involving farmers.

According to the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Sports Commission investigation team, many of the folk sports activities currently popular in pastoral and rural areas, such as wrestling, weightlifting, tug-of-war, archery, nine-pin bowling, ball tossing, Aksu Yok (white bone game), horseback wrestling, horseback combat, horseback silver picking, horse racing, and horseback relay racing, are rich and diverse and worthy of promotion. The Autonomous Region Sports Commission is in the process of sorting them out by category, preparing to select and promote them.

    新疆民间体育活动丰富多采
    本报讯　新疆维吾尔自治区农村群众性的体育活动已有较快的发展。焉耆回族自治县九个乡中，就有三十四个球队。新源县每三天就有一次中型的摔跤比赛。查布察尔锡伯族自治县三区一乡，经常有许多农民在收工后练习射箭。呼图壁县魏户农业社经常参加排球运动的社员有二百多人。吐鲁番、鄯善、托克逊三县的十七个农业社，还举行过农民体育运动大会。托克逊县今年又举行了以农民为主的速度赛马。
    据新疆维吾尔自治区体委调查组发现，目前流行在牧区和农村的民间体育活动，如摔跤、举重、拔河、射箭、九柱戏、托球、阿克苏约克（白骨游戏）、马上角力、马上对抗、马上拾银、赛马、马上接力等有很多是丰富多采，具有推广价值的。自治区体委正在分项整理，准备选择推广。
