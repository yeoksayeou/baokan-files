Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an Dispatch: According to a recent investigation by relevant departments in Shaanxi Province, this year more than 5,440 agricultural cooperatives in Shaanxi Province have caught up with or exceeded the production level of local rich middle peasants, accounting for about 17% of the total number of agricultural cooperatives in the province. In the Qin Chuan Plain area and the Hanzhong Basin, agricultural cooperatives whose production level has caught up with or exceeded that of local rich middle peasants account for about 20% of the total number of agricultural cooperatives. In Xianyang, Gaoling, Pucheng, and the suburbs of Xi'an, the figure is as high as 30% or more. In general mountainous areas, about 10% of agricultural cooperatives have reached or exceeded the production level of rich middle peasants.

In the past two years, Party committees and people's governments at all levels in Shaanxi Province have paid great attention to rapidly improving the production level of agricultural cooperatives based on the fact that agricultural cooperativization has been realized throughout the province. Last year, in carrying out the bumper harvest movement in the province, it was proposed to systematically promote five production reforms throughout the province, including changing low-yield crops to high-yield crops, changing two crops in three years to two crops in one year, and changing single-season rice to double-season rice, and to pay attention to building water conservancy projects, accumulating fertilizer, and rationally organizing labor, as well as vigorously promoting improved varieties, implementing reasonable close planting, promoting new farm tools, and promoting autumn plowing and deep plowing. All localities have implemented the above-mentioned production increase measures in accordance with local conditions, so that the production level has continued to increase. Gaoling County's average grain yield per mu this year reached 409 jin, and 30% of agricultural cooperatives have reached or exceeded the production level of rich middle peasants. Pucheng County has 130 cooperatives that have caught up with and exceeded the production level of rich middle peasants, accounting for about 37.5% of the total number of cooperatives in the county.

The common characteristics of these agricultural cooperatives that have caught up with and exceeded the production level of rich middle peasants are that they were established early, have better production and management, pay attention to diligence and thrift in running the cooperatives, and fully utilize the superior conditions of cooperation, and actively implement various production increase measures.

The fact that the agricultural and sideline production of these agricultural cooperatives has developed rapidly and quickly caught up with and exceeded the production level of rich middle peasants greatly demonstrates the superiority of cooperation. In Hengkou District, Ankang County, more than 200 rich middle peasant households used to believe that their land was good and their livestock was strong, and they were unwilling to join the cooperatives. They wanted to "compete" with the agricultural cooperatives outside the cooperatives. As a result, they lost the competition for two years in a row. This year, except for a small number of individual farmers who have slightly increased production, most individual households have not increased or decreased production, while agricultural cooperatives have increased production by more than 20% compared to them. Therefore, they have asked to join agricultural cooperatives one after another.

### 比赛两年赢了两年  陕西省有五千多个农业社  超过当地富裕中农生产水平

    比赛两年赢了两年
    陕西省有五千多个农业社  超过当地富裕中农生产水平
    据新华社西安电　据陕西省有关部门的最近调查，今年陕西省已有五千四百四十多个农业社赶上或超过当地富裕中农的生产水平，约占全省农业社总数的17％。秦川平原地区和汉中盆地生产水平赶上或超过当地富裕中农生产水平的农业社，约占农业社总数的20％。咸阳、高陵、蒲城和西安市郊高达30％以上。一般山区也有10％左右的农业社达到或超过富裕中农的生产水平。
    近两年来，陕西省各级党委和人民政府根据全省已实现农业合作化的情况，对迅速提高农业社的生产水平十分重视。去年这个省在开展丰产运动中，提出在全省有计划地推行改低产作物为高产作物、改两年三熟为一年两熟、改单季稻为双季稻等五项生产改革，并要注意兴修水利、积肥和合理组织劳力，以及大力推广良种、实行合理密植、推广新式农具，推行秋耕和深耕等。各地因地制宜地贯彻了上述增产措施，使生产水平不断增涨。高陵县今年粮食每亩平均产量达到四百零九斤，30％的农业社已经达到或超过富裕中农的生产水平。蒲城县已有一百三十个社赶上和超过了富裕中农的生产水平，约占全县总社数的37．5％。
    这些赶上和超过富裕中农生产水平的农业社的共同特点是，建社早、生产经营管理较好、注意勤俭办社，并充分发挥合作化的优越条件，积极贯彻各项增产措施。
    这些农业社的农副业生产发展迅速，很快赶上和超过富裕中农生产水平的事实，大大显示了合作化的优越性。安康县恒口区二百多户富裕中农过去认为自己的土地好、畜力壮，不愿入社，要在社外和农业社“比赛”。结果比了两年他们输了两年。今年除少部分单干农民略有增产外，大部分单干户不增不减或减产，而农业社比他们增产20％多。因此，他们纷纷要求加入农业社。
