Xinhua News Agency, November 2nd: The Head Office of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association received a telegram of congratulations from the Presidium of the Inaugural Meeting of the Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association. The full text of the telegram is as follows:

Beijing, Head Office of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, Dear Comrades and Friends:

    We are honored to inform you, and through you, to inform all members of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, composed of millions of people, and the entire Chinese people, that on October 29th of this year, a meeting was held in Moscow, including representatives from various Soviet social organizations, the scientific and cultural circles, the Soviet Army and Navy, workers, collective farmers, and students, unanimously adopted a resolution to establish the Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association. This resolution reflects the ardent wishes of the two hundred million people of the Soviet Union.

    The main tasks of this newly established association are: to promote the further development and consolidation of the fraternal friendship and cooperation between the peoples of the Soviet Union and China; to expand cultural cooperation between the Soviet Union and China; to more widely introduce the life of the Chinese people and the achievements made in socialist construction to all sectors of Soviet society; to comprehensively exchange experiences in cultural construction with the People's Republic of China; and to comprehensively introduce the economic and cultural construction of the Soviet state to the Chinese people. After the resolution to establish the Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association in the Soviet Union was adopted, the initiators elected a council of fifty people for the Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association and unanimously elected Comrade Andrei Andreyev, a well-known Soviet social activist, as the chairman of the association council.

    As we tell you this exciting event, it is the days when the Soviet and Chinese peoples, together with all the peoples of the socialist camp and millions of kind people around the world, are preparing to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution; we earnestly hope that the traditional friendship established on the basis of Lenin's principles of proletarian internationalism, as well as the common goals of our two peoples, will enable the young Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association and the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association under your leadership to establish the closest ties in their work.

    We would like to take this opportunity to express the profound fraternal friendship that fills the hearts of the Soviet people to all the people of the People's Republic of China on behalf of all the people of the Soviet Union.

              The Presidium of the Inaugural Meeting of the Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association
                    October 30, 1957, Moscow
