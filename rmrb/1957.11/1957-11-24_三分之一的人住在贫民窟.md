    One-Third of People Live in Slums
    The American magazine "The Nation" recently published an article stating that in the United States, "the living conditions of one-third of the people are shockingly bad."

    The article said that amidst the government's clamor of "prosperity," "housing shortages and hardship continue to exist side by side." Many "homeless people" just want "any housing, no matter how bad." It pointed out that greedy landlords take this opportunity to charge tenants high rents. "In Columbus, Ohio, one such large house is taxed at only $1,970, but the landlord collects $7,260 in rent annually, which is 368% of the tax amount."

    The article cited Stamford, a city in Connecticut generally considered to have a high standard of living, as an example. "Stamford is a model place in most other respects, but a recent survey showed that 10% of its commercial district housing lacks bathrooms, or is dilapidated, overcrowded, or otherwise does not meet the standards of the Census Bureau."

    The author pointed out: "Housing conditions are equally miserable elsewhere. In most cities, including Washington, Chicago, New York, Philadelphia, New Orleans, and some West Coast cities, millions of people are crammed into small, poorly equipped spaces. Substandard housing accounts for as much as one-fifth of all available housing. The overcrowding among Black people, Puerto Ricans, Mexicans, and other minorities is, on average, six times that of white people."

    According to the "New York Herald Tribune," data from the Census Bureau shows that in New York, no fewer than 250,000 homes do not meet the minimum requirements declared by the municipal authorities. Four hundred thousand families still live in houses built before 1901. 1.5 million New Yorkers (two-thirds of whom are Black and Puerto Rican) live in overcrowded slums.

    The newspaper described the situation of a house with sixty families living in it, with each family occupying only one room. The newspaper wrote, "In a kitchen shared by thirty children and fourteen adults, the window panes are broken, gas pipes often leak, and the walls are full of rat holes. A bathroom shared by so many people has become a breeding ground for infectious diseases, and the odor here can be suffocating."

### 三分之一的人住在贫民窟

    三分之一的人住在贫民窟
    美国“民族”周刊不久以前发表一篇文章说，美国“全国有三分之一的人的居住条件令人吃惊。”
    文章说，在政府叫嚷“繁荣”声中，“房荒和困苦继续一同存在着”。很多“没有庇身之所的人”只要“有房就行，那管好坏”。它指出，贪财的地产主还要借此机会向房客收高额房租，“俄亥俄州哥伦布城有一幢这样的大房子，抽起税来只有一千九百七十美元，可是房东每年所收的租金达七千二百六十美元，为纳税额的368％。”
    文章把一般被认为生活水平较高的康涅狄格州的一个城市斯坦弗作为例子说，“斯坦弗在大多数其他方面是一个模范地方，但是最近的一个调查说明，它的商业区住宅中有10％没有浴室，或者是破烂不堪、过份拥挤，或者在其他方面不够国情普查局的标准。”
    作者指出：“其他地方住宅情况同样悲惨。在大多数城市中，包括华盛顿、芝加哥、纽约、费城、新奥尔良以及西海岸的一些城市，千百万人挤在设备简陋的小块地方。简陋住宅在所有可供人住的住宅中比例高达五分之一。黑人、波多黎各人、墨西哥人及其他少数民族的拥挤程度平均为白人的六倍。”
    另据“纽约先驱论坛报”报道，根据国情普查局的资料，纽约有不下二十五万所住宅不符合市政当局宣布的起码的要求。有四十万个家庭仍居住在1901年以前建造的房屋里。一百五十万纽约人（其中三分之二是黑人和波多黎各人）居住在拥挤不堪的贫民窟内。
    报纸叙述了一幢有六十家人家居住的房子的情况，这里每家只有一间屋子。报纸写道，“在一个三十个孩子和十四个大人公用的厨房里，窗玻璃已经破碎，煤气管常常漏气，墙上满是老鼠洞。同样有那么多人使用的一个洗澡间成了传染病的发源地，这里的气味可以使人窒息。”
