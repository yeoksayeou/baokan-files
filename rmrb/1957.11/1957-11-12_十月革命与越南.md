    The October Revolution and Vietnam
    Xiao Guang
    The First Patriots Influenced by the October Revolution
    In the summer of 1919, the French warship "Paris" sailed into the Black Sea. It was ordered to coordinate with the British and French troops landing in the Odessa and South Caucasus areas to launch an attack on the young Soviet Republic. When the sailors discovered that they had been sent to suppress the revolution of their Russian worker brothers, they were very angry. After heated debates that lasted all night, thousands of soldiers unanimously decided to revolt.
    At dawn, the warship "Paris," flying a bright red flag, turned around and resolutely sailed back to the Mediterranean. The young Vietnamese sailor who personally raised the red flag symbolizing the revolution that day was Ton Duc Thang. He soon returned to his homeland and secretly began organizing trade unions. He is now the Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Vietnam National Assembly.
    In addition to Ton Duc Thang, the first patriotic people who accepted and spread the influence of the Russian October Revolution also included: Phan Van Truong, a lawyer living in France. His newspapers "La Cloche Fêlée" and "An Nam" reprinted articles from the French "L'Humanité" introducing the proletarian revolution very early on, and published the full text of Marx and Engels' "Communist Manifesto." Phan Boi Chau, a famous Vietnamese revolutionary in the early 20th century, began studying and promoting Marxism from 1920... But the most outstanding representative was Nguyen Ai Quoc (now President Ho Chi Minh). He went to Europe to work before the outbreak of World War I, intending to find the truth of revolution overseas. In 1918, when he settled in Paris, he was encouraged by the victory of the October Revolution and hoped to find a correct path for the Vietnamese revolution with the help of the Russian revolutionary experience. He devoted himself to studying and disseminating Marxism to the country and actively participated in Vietnamese revolutionary activities. In 1920, he organized the "Vietnam Marxist Group" in Paris, and expanded it into the "Colonial Association" the following year, and published a "Paris Weekly" called "Le Paria," exposing the crimes of the French colonialists and advocating for national independence. Nguyen Ai Quoc joined the French Socialist Party, but when the Socialist Party split in 1920, he firmly supported the left wing's proposal to join the Third International and became a glorious Communist Party member.
    The Influence of the October Revolution Spreads to Vietnam
    After the end of World War I, despite the French colonialists' best efforts to blockade it, the influence of the October Revolution surged into Vietnam like an iron torrent.
    Through various books and newspapers sent from France and China, the Vietnamese began to know that a new workers' regime had emerged on one-sixth of the earth's land. Activists of the Vietnamese national liberation movement greedily read every revolutionary publication that came from abroad. Popular pamphlets compiled and printed by the Chinese Communist Party, such as:
  "Communism ABC," "Trade Union Work," "How to Mobilize the Peasant Masses"... as well as some newspapers and periodicals published by Vietnamese revolutionaries in France, were their main reading materials.
    As the Chinese revolution turned to a climax in 1923, Marxist ideas powerfully touched the Vietnamese working class, whose class consciousness was budding, and the petty bourgeoisie, who were looking for a way out. More and more revolutionary intellectuals joined the battle, and they began to propagate Marxism-Leninism among the proletariat and all working people. Marxist groups appeared, and secret trade unions were also established in major French enterprises.
    Soon, most of the Marxist groups joined the Vietnam Revolutionary Youth League. This revolutionary party was formed in 1925 by Vietnamese revolutionaries living in Guangzhou, the center of the Chinese people's revolutionary struggle in the early 1920s. It published various publications to promote Marxism-Leninism and the idea of national liberation; and organized a large number of Vietnamese revolutionary youths to study at the Whampoa Military Academy in Guangzhou or short-term training courses. Many comrades, such as Tran Phu, the first general secretary of the Indochinese Communist Party, Pham Van Dong, the current Prime Minister of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and Le Thiet Hung, a senior general of the Vietnamese People's Army, were sent to China by the Youth League around 1926 to receive Marxist-Leninist education. Domestically, the Vietnam Revolutionary Youth League called on its members to go deep into factories, rural areas, and schools to actively lead the anti-French struggle.
    It should be noted that the Vietnamese proletariat had already formed in the early 20th century, and after World War I, it developed greatly. At that time, in order to heal its war wounds, the French colonialists stepped up the development of Vietnamese resources. Its investment was only 492 million francs in the 20 years from 1898 to 1918, but it increased to 4 billion francs in 1929. The proletariat also grew accordingly, with the Vietnamese workforce expanding from 100,000 in 1919 to more than 200,000 in 1929.
    In early 1925, following the strike of workers at the Hanoi Luxi Auto Repair Factory demanding a six-day work week and the protest against wage cuts by workers at the Nam Dinh Brewery, workers in various Vietnamese enterprises and plantations rose up like a storm to oppose exploitation and abuse. The working masses were tempered in the fiery struggle, and the slogan "Workers of all countries, unite!" gradually took root in the hearts of the people.
      After that, the workers' movement was no longer limited to economic struggles. In August of this year, workers at the Saigon Ba Son Shipyard held a ten-day strike, resolutely preventing French warships from carrying troops to Shanghai and Guangzhou to suppress the Chinese revolution. In the nationwide patriotic movements such as "Demanding the release of Phan Boi Chau and Nguyen An Ninh" and "Wearing mourning for patriotic person Phan Chu Trinh," the Vietnamese working class always stood at the forefront of the ranks.
    In 1926, leaflets introducing the October Revolution and the Soviet Union appeared in Saigon when commemorating the October Revolution Day.
    The anti-imperialist and anti-feudal national democratic revolution program put forward by the Vietnam Revolutionary Youth League was also widely spread among the Vietnamese people.
    The movement of workers' strikes, peasants' resistance to taxes and levies, and students' strikes rose higher and higher.
    Thanks to the guidance of the Vietnam Revolutionary Youth League, the Vietnamese people's struggle embarked on the road illuminated by the victory of the October Revolution.
    The Birth of the Indochinese Communist Party
    In the upsurge of the patriotic movement that began in 1925, a fierce struggle between proletarian and bourgeois ideologies unfolded, and the focus of the struggle was: who should lead the Vietnamese revolution. Until 1928, the idea of the proletariat leading the revolution only existed among a section of revolutionaries; after 1929, it was gradually established among all revolutionaries. This was partly because the influence of the October Socialist Revolution spread more and more widely in Vietnam; on the other hand, the betrayal of the Chinese revolution by the big bourgeoisie in 1927 also gave the Vietnamese revolutionaries a particularly profound lesson.
    After the issue of leadership of the revolution was resolved, a new question was presented: the working and peasant masses demanded a clear program of struggle.
    Advanced revolutionaries demanded to emulate the examples of the Soviet Union and China and organize the Communist Party according to Lenin's principles of party building.
    After 1925, various Communist Party organizations appeared in Vietnam one after another.
    The first branch of the Indochinese Communist Party was established in Hanoi by seven advanced members of the Vietnam Revolutionary Youth League led by Ngo Gia Tu.
    Another group of members of the Vietnam Revolutionary Youth League formed the Annam Communist Party in Saigon.
    In the central region, the young members of the "New Vietnam Revolutionary Party" split off and formed the Indochinese Communist League.
    This year, the Vietnamese people publicly commemorated the October Revolution Day in front of the enemy for the first time. Patterns of sickles and axes and slogans of the Communist Party were seen everywhere.
    The three Communist Party organizations achieved considerable success in leading the masses in the anti-French struggle, but the situation of being unconnected to each other could not but cause concern. Faced with the colonialists' terror, this weakness was exposed more prominently.
    In January 1930, Nguyen Ai Quoc, who had just returned from exile in Siam, summoned the leaders of the three organizations to a meeting in Hong Kong. Under the active promotion of Nguyen Ai Quoc, on January 6, the Vietnamese Communist Party was officially established (renamed the Indochinese Communist Party in October of the same year).
    A program of action for a bourgeois democratic revolution was also drafted. Here, the party put forward the slogans of "Establishing Workers', Peasants', and Soldiers' Soviets" and "Supporting the Russian Soviet Federation."
    Encouraged by the unification of the party and encouraged by the new program, the soldiers worked enthusiastically.
    In April, the strike and demonstration of textile workers in Nam Dinh City broke out. Strike and demonstration movements took place one after another in the north, south, and central regions. In some areas, the entire population participated in the struggle.
    The people demanded the reduction of exorbitant taxes and levies, demanded democratic freedom, the release of political prisoners, and the termination of the terror system.
    The French authorities' answer was: bombing, arrests, and massacres. But the people did not yield. The movement continued to develop, widely and deeply.
    In Nghi An and Ha Tinh provinces in the central region, the peasants overthrew the power of the French rulers and established their own Soviet regime. The insurgent peasants declared these regions independent, implemented democratic freedom, and divided the landlords' land for the first time in Vietnamese history.
    The struggle lasted for several months. The workers and peasants in the north and south provinces rose up to support the Soviet movement in the two provinces.
    The French authorities dispatched the West African Legion and the Roman Legion, slaughtering, burning, and using a policy of blood and fire to deal with the unarmed peasants.
    The colonialists achieved a superficial victory. However, the influence of the Soviet movement was deeply rooted in the hearts of the Vietnamese people.
    Prison – A School for Party Cadres
    After 1932, the Vietnamese revolution entered a low ebb.
    Tens of thousands of Communist Party members and party sympathizers were arrested. Vietnam's famous prisons, such as Con Dao and Buon Ma Thuot in the south, Son La in the northwest, Hoa Lo in Hanoi, and No. 6 Prison in Saigon... were almost full of political prisoners.
    Even when imprisoned, the heroic revolutionaries never stopped fighting.
    Based on memory or some books occasionally smuggled in from the outside, the party cadres devoted themselves to compiling and translating the works of Lenin and Stalin and the Soviet revolutionary experience. Words the size of rice grains were densely written on cigarette packets and rough paper, stapled into small booklets, and circulated among each other. The first Vietnamese version of "Problems of Leninism" was translated under such circumstances.
    The books and booklets were all stored in secret wall holes and ceilings. That was everyone's "political bookcase." Almost every large prison cell had its own "bookcase." After the French found them, they burned all the books and hung up the cadres for brutal torture. But they never gave up, and often started over as soon as they were burned.
    In prisons with better conditions, like Con Dao, after guards or cleaners were won over, books, newspapers, and paper had a source. Party cadres then took advantage of every inch of space to read extensively classic works such as "The Communist Manifesto," "Anti-Dühring," "Two Tactics," "Left-Wing Communism: An Infantile Disorder," and "The Foundations of Leninism." They also summarized the experiences and lessons of the 1930-1931 struggle in prison, and fought against the erroneous ideas of individual terror. Around 1930, when the revolution was at its peak, many party members had no time to study the party's program and communist theory before joining the battle; now they started to catch up. They secretly organized themselves, and party cadres gave lessons every day.
    From 1930 to 1936, the comrades responsible for conducting Marxist-Leninist education for political prisoners in Con Dao Prison, in addition to Ngo Gia Tu who had sacrificed, also included Le Duan, Pham Van Dong, Pham Hung, and Le Thanh Nghi, members of the current Politburo of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Workers' Party, and Ha Huy Giap, a member of the Central Committee. At that time, Comrade Truong Chinh was responsible for the party's education work in Son La Prison in the northwest.
    In 1936, the French Popular Front won the victory, some reformist measures began to be implemented in the colonies, and a group of political prisoners were released from prison. Armed with Leninism, the comrades plunged back into the flames of struggle. Three years later, the French Popular Front collapsed, a large number of Communist Party members were sentenced to death, and those comrades who were thrown back into prison immediately took on the education and organization work of the party class.
    In this way, the Indochinese Communist Party turned the prisons used by the colonialists to kill people into schools for training and cultivating cadres. Many cadres it cultivated later became the backbone of the August Revolution.
    After 1939, under the white terror of the reactionary ruling group, the Vietnamese revolution sometimes entered a high tide, and sometimes temporarily turned to a low ebb; but the doctrines of Marx and Lenin and the fact that the first socialist country existed and was becoming increasingly consolidated were deeply engraved in the hearts of the Vietnamese people.
    Every year on the anniversary of the October Revolution, people held commemorations. No matter how the enemy monitored and searched, the red flag still flew over the roofs or trees in Hanoi and Saigon.
    For more than 30 years, the torch of the great October Revolution has always shone on the revolutionary road of Vietnam. Now, North Vietnam has been liberated. Under the leadership of the Vietnam Workers' Party and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the Vietnamese people are fighting along the road of the October Revolution for the peaceful reunification of the motherland and the construction of a socialist society.

    十月革命与越南
    萧光
    第一批接受十月革命影响的爱国者
    1919年夏天，法国战舰“巴黎号”开进了黑海。它奉命配合在敖德萨和南高加索一带登陆的英、法军队，对年轻的苏维埃共和国发动进攻。当水兵们探明自己是被派去镇压俄国工人兄弟的革命时，他们都非常愤怒。经过通宵达旦的热烈争论，几千名战士一致决定起义。
    黎明的时候，飘扬着鲜艳红旗的“巴黎号”战舰掉转船身，毅然驶回地中海。这一天，亲手升起那面象征革命的红旗的，是一位年轻的越南水手——孙德胜。他不久就回到自己的祖国，着手秘密地组织工会。现在他是越南国民大会常务委员会的委员长。
    除了孙德胜，第一批接受和传播俄国十月革命影响的爱国志士还有：潘文章，一位侨居法国的律师。他主编的报纸“破钟”和“安南”，很早就转载法国“人道报”介绍无产阶级革命的文章，并全文刊登马克思、恩格斯的“共产党宣言”。潘佩珠，二十世纪初越南著名的革命者，从1920年开始研究和宣传马克思主义。……而其中最杰出的代表是阮爱国（现在的胡志明主席）。他在第一次世界大战爆发以前去欧洲做工，打算在海外找寻革命的真理。1918年，他在巴黎定居下来时，受到十月革命胜利的鼓舞，希望借助俄国革命经验的启发，为越南革命找出一条正确的道路。他致力研究和向国内传播马克思主义，积极地参加越南的革命活动。1920年，他在巴黎组织了“越南马克思主义小组”，第二年把它扩大为“殖民地协会”，并且出版一个名为“穷苦人”的“巴黎周报”，揭露法国殖民者的罪恶，宣传争取民族独立。阮爱国参加了法国社会党，但当1920年社会党分裂时，他坚决拥护左派的参加第三国际的主张，成为光荣的共产党员。
    十月革命的影响传入越南
    第一次世界大战结束以后，尽管法国殖民者百般封锁，十月革命的影响还是像铁流一样地冲进越南来。
    通过由法国和由中国寄来的各种书报，越南人开始知道在地球六分之一的土地上，出现了一个新的劳动者的政权。越南民族解放运动的活动家们，贪婪地阅读每一本从国外传来的革命书刊。中国共产党编印的通俗小册子如：
  “共产主义ABC”、“工会工作”、“怎样发动农民群众”……，以及越南革命者在法国出版的一些报刊，是他们最主要的读物。
    随着1923年中国革命转向高潮，马克思主义思潮有力地触动了阶级意识正在萌芽的越南工人阶级以及正在寻找出路的小资产阶级。越来越多的革命知识分子参加了战斗，他们开始在无产阶级和全体劳动人民中间宣传马列主义思想。马克思主义小组出现了，秘密工会也在主要的法国企业里建立起来。
    不久，马克思主义小组大都加入越南青年革命同志会。这个革命政党是由二十年代初期住在中国人民革命斗争中心——广东的越南革命者，在1925年组成的。它出版各种刊物，宣传马克思列宁主义和民族解放的思想；并且大批组织越南革命青年到广州入黄埔军校或是短期训练班学习。印度支那共产党第一任总书记陈富、现在的越南民主共和国总理范文同、越南人民军高级将领黎铁雄等许多同志，都曾在1926年前后由同志会送到中国接受马克思列宁主义教育。在国内，越南青年革命同志会号召会员们深入工厂、农村和学校，积极领导反法斗争。
    需要说明的是：越南无产阶级在二十世纪初期已经形成，第一次世界大战以后，有了很大发展。当时法国殖民者为了医治它的战争创伤，加紧开发越南资源。它的投资在1898到1918的二十年间只有四亿九千二百万法郎，1929年已增加到四十亿法郎。无产阶级也随之壮大，越南工人队伍从1919年的十万人扩充到1929年的二十多万。
    1925年初，紧接着河内路西汽车修配厂工人要求每周工作六天和南定酿酒厂工人抗议降低工资的罢工，越南各个企业和种植场的工人，风起云涌地起来反对剥削、反对虐待。劳动群众在火热的斗争中受到锻炼，“全世界无产者联合起来”的口号渐渐深入人心。
      此后，工人运动已不再限于经济斗争。这年8月，西贡巴双修船厂工人就曾举行为期十天的大罢工，坚决阻挠法国战舰载运军队去上海、广州镇压中国革命。在“要求释放潘佩珠、阮安宁”以及“为爱国志士潘周桢戴孝”等全民性的爱国运动中，越南工人阶级也始终站在队伍的前列。
    1926年，纪念十月革命节时，介绍十月革命和苏联的传单在西贡出现了。
    越南青年革命同志会提出的反帝反封建的民族民主革命纲领，也在越南人民中间广泛地传播开了。
    工人罢工、农民抗捐抗税、学生罢课的运动日益高涨。
    由于越南青年革命同志会的引导，越南人民斗争走上了十月革命胜利照耀的道路。
    印度支那共产党的诞生
    在1925年开始的爱国运动高潮中，展开了无产阶级和资产阶级思想的一场激烈的斗争，斗争的焦点是：越南革命由谁领导。直到1928年，无产阶级领导革命的思想还只存在于一部分革命者中间；1929年以后，它才在所有的革命者当中逐步确立起来。这，一方面由于十月社会主义革命的影响在越南境内越来越广泛地流传；另一方面，1927年中国大资产阶级的背叛革命，也给了越南革命者一个特别深刻的教训。
    革命的领导权问题解决了，新的课题却又呈现在眼前：工农群众要求明确的斗争纲领。
    先进的革命者要求仿效苏联和中国的榜样，按照列宁的建党原则组织共产党。
    1925年以后，越南各个共产党的组织相继出现了。
    以吴嘉嗣为首的越南青年革命同志会的七个先进分子，在河内建立了印度支那共产党第一个支部。
    越南青年革命同志会的另一部分会员，在西贡组成了安南共产党。
    在中部，“新越南革命党”的青年党员分裂出来，成立了印度支那共产主义联团。
    这一年，越南人民第一次在敌人面前公开纪念十月革命节。镰刀、斧头的图案和共产党的标语，随处可见。
    三个共产党组织在领导群众反法斗争中获得不小的成绩，只是彼此互不联系的状况却不能不令人忧虑，面对着殖民者的恐怖，这个弱点暴露得更加显著。
    1930年1月，阮爱国刚从暹罗流亡归来，便将三个组织的领袖召集到香港开会。在阮爱国的积极推动下，1月6日，越南共产党正式成立了（同年10月改名为印度支那共产党）。
    一个资产阶级民主革命的行动纲领也告草成。在这里，党提出了“成立工农兵苏维埃”、“拥护俄罗斯苏维埃联邦”的口号。
    受到党的统一的鼓励和新的政纲的鼓励，战士们热烈地工作。
    4月，爆发了南定市纺织工人的罢工和示威游行。罢工示威运动在北部、南部和中部接连发生。有些地区，全体民众都参加了斗争。
    人民要求减轻苛捐杂税，要求民主自由，释放政治犯，终止恐怖制度。
    法国当局的答复是：轰炸、逮捕和屠杀。但民众并没有屈服。运动继续发展，广泛而且深入。
    在中部宜安、河静两省，农民推翻了法国统治者的政权，建立了自己的苏维埃政权。起义的农民宣布这些地区独立，实行民主自由，并且在越南历史上第一次平分了地主的土地。
    斗争持续了好几个月。南北各省的工农群众纷纷起来支援两省的苏维埃运动。
    法国当局调来了西非军团和罗马军团，屠杀、焚烧，用血和火的政策对付赤手空拳的农民。
    殖民者取得了表面上的胜利。苏维埃运动的影响却在越南人民的心里深深地扎下了根。
    监狱——党的干部学校
    1932年后，越南革命转入低潮。
    数以万计的共产党员和党的同情者遭到逮捕。越南著名的监狱，如：南部的昆仑岛和邦美蜀、西北的山萝、河内的火炉、西贡的六号监……几乎全挤满了政治犯。
    英勇的革命者即使被关在监狱里面，也一刻不停地进行着斗争。
    党的干部凭记忆，或偶尔从外面偷运进来的一些书籍，埋头编译列宁、斯大林的著作和苏联革命经验。米粒大小的字密密麻麻地写在香烟包和草纸上，钉成小册子，互相传阅。第一部越南文的“列宁主义问题”就是在这样的情况下译成的。
    书和小册子全都收藏在秘密的墙洞和顶棚里。那是大家的“政治书橱”。几乎每间较大的牢房都有自己的“书橱”。法国人搜到以后，就把所有的书都烧光，并且把干部吊起来残酷拷打。但他们从不气馁，往往刚刚烧完就动手重搞。
    在条件较好的监狱，像昆仑岛，看守人或清洁工被争取过来后，书报和纸张就有了来源。党的干部们于是利用每一寸空隙大量阅读“共产党宣言”、“反杜林论”、“两个策略”、“论共产主义运动中的左派幼稚病”、“论列宁主义基础”等经典著作。他们还在监狱里总结了1930—1931年斗争的经验和教训，并且同个人恐怖的错误思想进行斗争。1930年前后正是革命高潮，许多党员没来得及学习党的纲领和共产主义理论，就投入了战斗；现在才开始补课。他们秘密地组织起来，天天由党的干部给上课。
    从1930年到1936年间，在昆仑岛监狱负责对政治犯进行马列主义教育的同志，除了已牺牲的吴嘉嗣，还有现在的越南劳动党中央政治局委员黎润、范文同、范雄、黎诚毅，中央委员何辉甲等。当时在西北的山萝监狱，负责党的教育工作的是长征同志。
    1936年，法国人民阵线获得了胜利，一些改良主义的措施开始在殖民地实施，一批政治犯被释放出狱。由列宁主义武装起来的同志，重新投入了斗争的烽火。三年后，法国人民阵线瓦解，大批共产党员被判处死刑，而那些重被投进监牢的同志，立刻担负起党课的教育和组织工作。
    就这样，印度支那共产党把殖民者用以杀人的监狱，变成了锻炼和培养干部的学校。它所培养出来的许多干部，后来都成了八月革命的骨干。
    1939年以后，在反动统治集团的白色恐怖下，越南革命有时进入高潮，有时又暂时转入低潮；但是马克思、列宁主义的学说和第一个社会主义国家存在并且日益巩固的事实，却深深地铭刻在越南人民的心中。
    每逢十月革命节，人们都举行纪念。不管敌人怎么监视、搜查，红旗照样在河内和西贡的屋顶或是树上飘扬。
    三十多年来，在越南的革命道路上，始终闪耀着伟大十月革命的火炬。现在，越南北方已经获得解放。越南人民正在越南劳动党和越南民主共和国政府的领导下，沿着十月革命的道路，为争取和平统一祖国和建设社会主义社会而奋斗。
