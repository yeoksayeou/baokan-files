    We Have Weapons to Fight Bad People and Bad Deeds
    "The law cannot be bullied by individuals, with the law we govern people" Editor:
    After the promulgation of the "Regulations on Penalties for Public Security Administration of the People's Republic of China," the village cadres in Zhaodianzi, Qian'an County, Hebei Province, discussed it. Everyone unanimously expressed their support for these regulations. Many cadres mentioned that agricultural cooperatives often find that some members damage collective interests and violate labor discipline, which makes everyone feel very tricky. Since autumn, some members who love petty advantages have disregarded overall interests and stolen peanuts, sweet potatoes, and corn from the agricultural cooperatives. The six townships and thirty-four agricultural cooperatives under the jurisdiction of Zhaodianzi discovered 37 such thefts in just two months, stealing more than 1,600 jin of grain, 300 jin of peanuts, and 600 jin of sweet potatoes. Other phenomena, such as resisting policies, gambling, and beating people, which violate national discipline and endanger the interests of the people, have also occurred. Because the above phenomena have not been stopped for a long time, the masses are very dissatisfied and reflect: "Bad people dominate, and good people suffer."
    Recently, after the promulgation of the regulations on public security administration, a group of lawbreakers were dealt with according to these regulations. The six townships and thirty-four agricultural cooperatives in Zhaodianzi educated and dealt with a group of lawbreakers, a total of 45 people, with very good results. Not only did it directly stop the phenomenon of theft, but also greatly stimulated the enthusiasm of the masses for production. The members reflected: "The law cannot be bullied by individuals, with the law we govern people."

    No Longer Helpless Against Bad People Editor:
    We express our heartfelt support for the "Regulations on Penalties for Public Security Administration of the People's Republic of China" promulgated by the People's Daily on October 23, because it embodies everyone's requirements.
    Today, in our society, although new moral customs are constantly growing, the bad thoughts and bad habits of the exploiting classes, such as harming others to benefit oneself, gaining without labor, and corrupting morality, will continue to have an impact and corrosion on the people for a long period of time. Take our handicraft cooperative as an example, there are such people: they can make trouble unreasonably in the cooperative and insult others at will. Their personal interests cannot be violated in any way, but they can arbitrarily violate collective interests and the discipline and system stipulated by everyone. They are complacent when they violate the discipline and say: "I don't make big mistakes, but I keep making small mistakes. It's not enough to be detained, and I have the final say when it comes to democracy." We have repeatedly educated these people, but it has no effect at all. Sometimes it can be controlled for a few days, but afterwards it is still the same. In their minds, it seems that they feel that the leaders can be deceived, and the leaders are indeed helpless against such people. Today, the state has promulgated these regulations on public security administration, and we have weapons to fight them. Therefore, I say that the promulgation of these regulations is of great significance for maintaining social order, consolidating national discipline, and defending socialist construction.

    The Safety of Our School is Guaranteed Editor:
    We feel happy from the bottom of our hearts that the "Regulations on Penalties for Public Security Administration of the People's Republic of China" has been promulgated. In the past, because there were no such regulations, we suffered a lot from bad elements.
    Our school is located in a market town in a rural area. There are several bad elements in the town who often come to the school to make trouble. When we perform a play, they cannot come in to watch the play, so they try all kinds of ways to make trouble, such as defecating in our rice bowls and smashing the glass of our windows while we are performing. Sometimes they even make trouble for no reason, making it impossible for you to continue the play. Sunflowers and tomatoes are planted in the school. Once they are ripe, they jump over the wall and steal them in batches. When female classmates walk on the street wearing new white pants, they throw large stones into the water to splash the female classmates' clothes and make fun of them... We know the names of these bad elements, but we dare not provoke them. Once, we sent the thieves to the town, but because their illegal behavior did not constitute a criminal offense, the town criticized and educated them and then released them quickly. This made them even more unscrupulous. After a few days, we found that the curtains in the classroom were missing, and the wooden boards used to build the house were also missing. Faced with such a phenomenon, we had to say: These people are simply lawless, but there is nothing we can do.
    Now, with the promulgation of the regulations on public security administration, these bad elements will no longer be at large, and the safety of our school will be guaranteed.

    Vigorously Publicize It, Exemplary Comply with It Editor:
    We have carefully read the regulations on public security administration penalties promulgated by the People's Daily on October 23. As a citizen, I feel that it is so亲切(close, intimate). The regulations stipulate that every article and every clause is some small thing that we often encounter in our daily life, but it is so closely related to our interests. Therefore, I think that we should vigorously publicize it and make it something that everyone knows. We should exemplarily abide by it and strive to assist the public security departments in supervising its implementation. I believe that through the implementation of these regulations, not only will some bad behaviors that endanger social order be restrained, but also the growth of new moral customs will be greatly promoted.

    我们有了同坏人坏事斗争的武器
    “无法人欺法，有法法治人”编辑同志：
    “中华人民共和国治安管理处罚条例”公布以后，我们河北省迁安县赵店子的乡村干部都进行了讨论。大家对这个条例一致表示拥护。很多干部谈到，目前农业社经常会发现一些社员损害集体利益、违犯劳动纪律的现象，使大家觉得很棘手。入秋以来，有些爱沾小便宜的社员不顾整体利益，偷窃农业社的花生、白薯、玉米。赵店子所辖的六个乡三十四个农业社，仅在两个月的时间内，就发现这样的偷盗现象三十七起，共偷粮食一千六百多斤，花生三百斤，白薯六百斤。其他如违抗政策、赌钱、打人等种种违反国家纪律和危害人民利益的现象也有发生，由于上述现象长期得不到制止，群众很不满意，反映说：“坏人称王称霸，好人反而吃亏。”
    最近治安管理条例公布以后，根据这个条例处理了一批违法分子，赵店子六个乡三十四个农业社教育处理了一批违法分子共四十五名，效果很好，不但直接制止了偷盗现象，还大大激发了群众的生产积极性，社员们反映说：“无法人欺法，有法法治人”。

    对坏人再不会束手无策了编辑同志：
    人民日报10月23日公布的“中华人民共和国治安管理处罚条例”我们表示衷心拥护，因为它体现了我们大家的要求。
    今天，在我们的社会里，虽然新的道德风气在不断成长，但在较长一段时期内，损人利己、不劳而获、败坏道德等剥削阶级的坏思想、坏习气，还会对人民时刻起着影响和腐蚀作用。就拿我们手工业合作社来说，就存在有这样的人：他们在社里可以无理取闹，随便辱骂别人。他们的个人利益不能受到任何触犯，而他们却可以任意违犯集体利益和大家规定的纪律和制度，违犯了纪律还得意忘形地说：“大错误不犯，小错误不断，挨押不够条件，讲民主得我说了算。”对这些人，我们曾多次进行教育，但是一点效果也没有，有时能管得几天，事后还是依然故我。在他们的心目中，似乎觉得领导可欺，而领导对这种人确实也是束手无策。今天，国家公布了这个治安管理处罚条例，我们便有了和他们斗争的武器。因此，我说，这个条例的公布对维护社会秩序，巩固国家纪律保卫社会主义建设是有极大作用的。

    我们学校的安全有了保障编辑同志：
    “中华人民共和国治安管理处罚条例”公布了，我们从心里感觉高兴，过去，由于没有这样的条例，曾使我们吃过坏分子不少的亏。
    我们的学校设在一个乡村的集镇上，镇上有几个坏分子，经常来学校捣乱。我们学校演戏，他们不能进来看戏，就想出种种办法捣乱，如趁我们演戏的时候，拉屎在我们的饭碗里，砸碎我们窗户的玻璃。有时甚至无端起哄，直闹得你无法把戏继续演下去。学校里种了向日葵和西红柿，一到长熟了，他们就跳墙进来成批盗窃。女同学穿了新白裤在街上走，他们就拿大石头往水里扔，以溅污女同学的衣服而取笑……这些坏分子，我们是知道他们的姓名的，但就是不敢惹他们。有一次，我们把偷盗分子送到镇里，但是，由于他们的违法行为还没有构成刑事犯罪，镇里对他们进行批评教育后，很快就又把他们放了。这样，就使他们更加肆无忌惮起来，过几天，我们就又发现教室的窗帘丢失了，盖房子用的木板也丢失了，面对这样的现象，我们只好说：这些人简直是无法无天了，却没有什么办法。
    现在，治安管理处罚条例公布了，这些坏分子再不会逍遥法外，我们学校的安全也就得到了保障。

    大力宣传它，模范地遵守它编辑同志：
    我们仔细读完了10月23日人民日报所公布的治安管理处罚条例，作为一个公民，我感到它是那样亲切。条例里面所规定的，无论那一条那一款都是我们日常生活中所常会接触到的一些细小的事，但是却又是那样密切地关系着我们的利益，所以，我认为，我们应该大力地宣传它，使其成为人人熟知的东西，应该模范地遵守它，同时要努力协助公安部门监督它的贯彻执行。我敢相信，通过这个条例的实施，不但会使一些危害社会秩序的不良行为受到约束，同时，还会大大促使新的道德风尚的成长。
