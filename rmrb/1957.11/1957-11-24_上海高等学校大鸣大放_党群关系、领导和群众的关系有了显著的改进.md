Xinhua News Agency report: Shanghai Higher Education Institutions' Great Blooming and Contending
Party-Masses Relations and Leader-Masses Relations Have Significantly Improved

    Xinhua News Agency News: Shanghai's various institutions of higher learning, which have just entered the rectification phase, have formed a magnificent rectification upsurge.
    At the beginning of the rectification phase, the Party committees and rectification leading work groups of many schools formulated improvement plans on fundamental issues such as leadership style, Party-masses relations, teaching and scientific research, explained them in detail to the masses, and published these plans in the form of large-character posters to mobilize everyone to discuss them. Shanghai First Normal School, with more than two thousand teachers, students, and staff, saw more than 2,500 large-character posters appear overnight after entering the rectification phase. The history department teachers of this school held more than ten meetings on the training of teaching assistants alone, and proposed a relatively complete plan. The school leaders then combined this plan with the relevant opinions and plans put forward by teachers and students at all levels, making it a more complete plan, and then submitted it to the masses for discussion until it was perfect.
    Strengthening teaching and scientific research, and improving teaching quality, is also an important task for the rectification of many schools. In order to strengthen the Party's leadership over teaching work, the Party committee of Fudan University stipulated in the rectification plan that from the Party Secretary to every full-time Party and Youth League cadre with certain qualifications, must spend four to eight hours a week participating in the activities of a teaching and research group; concentrate the strength of some teachers from the Department of Foreign Languages and the Department of Chinese to form a literary theory teaching and research group to strengthen the leadership of students' literary thought; encourage and assist teachers to strengthen contact with production enterprise departments. Party and administrative leading cadres such as the Party Secretary and Vice-President of Shanghai Fisheries College also began to frequently contact various departments to strengthen the teaching and scientific research work of each department. Leaders of some departments and teaching and research groups of Shanghai First Normal School also decided to regularly attend classes, and check and help teachers prepare lessons and provide specific guidance.
    At the same time, all schools are streamlining institutions in a revolutionary spirit, decentralizing cadres, and enriching grassroots forces. Shanghai Fisheries College, Shanghai Second Normal School and other schools have merged the organization department and propaganda department of the Party committee into the Party committee office, and drawn Party backbone forces to the departments and teaching and research groups. In the week since the rectification of Fudan University, more than 40 responsible cadres such as members of the Party committee have been decentralized to serve as Party general branch secretaries and student Party branch secretaries in various departments. Many full-time Party cadres of Shanghai First Medical College, Tongji University and other schools have begun to eat, live, and think with the students, becoming one with them.
    After the leaders went deep into the masses and the cadres were decentralized, there were significant changes in the relations between the Party and the masses, the League and the masses, and the leaders and the masses in various schools. The Party secretary and president of East China Textile Institute of Technology personally cleaned the dormitories and offices, and also went to the cafeteria to help the chefs, which greatly inspired the majority of teachers, students, and staff. Every Communist Party member in Fudan University and Shanghai First Normal School and other schools has formulated their own improvement plan. Many Party members generally adopted forms such as holding small-scale heart-to-heart talks with non-Party members and individual visits to sincerely solicit the opinions of the masses, making their improvement plans more practical and comprehensive. Li Yufen, a Party member lecturer at Fudan University, had some problems in teaching and was not united with a lecturer, which had not been resolved for two years. Now Li Yufen took the initiative to go to the lecturer's home and made a review to him, and the relationship between the two improved. Most of the student Party member cadres of Shanghai First Normal School have changed their work style, actively participate in collective activities, and care about class work, and the masses treat them as confidants. The school's mass political demands have generally increased. Many classes have increased their newspaper subscriptions, and many female students in Class 15 of the second grade of the Chinese Department have subscribed to plans to strive to join the Party. The broad masses of teachers and students universally and strongly demanded "to go into labor, transform ourselves into intellectuals of the working class." On Sundays and after school, batches of students and teachers often participate in physical labor on campus or in the rural areas of the suburbs.

    上海高等学校大鸣大放
    党群关系、领导和群众的关系有了显著的改进
    新华社讯　刚刚转入整改阶段的上海各高等学校，已形成一个波澜壮阔的整改热潮。
    整改阶段开始，许多学校的党委和整风领导工作组，就制订出关于领导作风、党群关系、教学与科学研究等根本问题的改进方案，向群众详加解释和说明，并用大字报形式把这些方案公布出来，发动大家讨论。有二千多个教师、学生和员工的上海第一师范学院，转入整改后的一夜间，即出现了大字报二千五百多张。这个学校历史系教师，单就助教的培养问题就召开了十多次会议，提出一个较为完善的方案。学校领导又将这个方案同各系级师生提出来的有关意见和方案加以综合，成为一个更为完善的方案，再交群众讨论。直到完善无缺时为止。
    加强教学与科学研究，提高教学质量，也是许多学校整改的一项重要课题。为了加强党对教学工作的领导，复旦大学党委在整改方案中规定，从党委书记到每一个具备一定条件的党团专职干部，每周必须抽出四至八小时参加一个教研组的活动；集中外文系和中文系的部分教师力量，成立文艺理论教研组，加强对学生的文艺思想的领导；鼓励和协助教师与生产企业部门加强联系。上海水产学院党委书记和副院长等党和行政的领导干部也开始做到经常与各系联系，加强各系教学和科学研究工作。上海第一师范学院有的系和教研组的领导人也决定定期下班级听课，并分头检查和帮助教师备课，进行具体指导。
    与此同时，各校都以革命精神紧缩机构，下放干部，充实基层力量。上海水产学院、上海第二师范学院等校都将党委组织部和宣传部并入党委办公室，抽出党员骨干力量到各系和教研组去。复旦大学整改一周来，已下放党委委员等四十多个负责干部，到各系担任党总支书记和学生党支部书记职务。上海第一医学院、同济大学等校许多党、专职干部，已开始和学生同饮食、共起居，生活、思想，打成一片。
    领导深入群众和干部下放以后，各校在党群、团群、领导与群众的关系方面，起了显著的变化。华东纺织工学院党委书记和院长等负责人亲自打扫宿舍和办公室，还到食堂帮助厨师工作，大大鼓舞了广大师生员工。复旦大学和上海第一师范学院等校每个共产党员都订出自己的改进计划，许多党员普遍采用和非党群众开小型谈心会以及个别访问等形式，诚恳地征求群众的意见，使自己的改进计划更切实、全面。复旦大学党员讲师李郁芬过去由于教学上的一些问题和一位讲师闹不团结，两年来一直没有解决。现在李郁芬主动地到这位讲师的家里去，向他作了检讨，两人关系改善了。上海第一师范学院大部分学生党员干部已转变工作作风，积极参加集体活动，关心班、级工作，群众把他们作知心朋友看待。该校群众政治要求普遍增强，不少班级增订了报纸，中文系二年级十五班的很多女学生，订了争取入党的计划。广大师生普遍而强烈地要求“到劳动中去，改造自己成为工人阶级的知识分子。”星期日和课余时间，经常都有成批的学生和教师在校园里或郊区农村参加体力劳动。
