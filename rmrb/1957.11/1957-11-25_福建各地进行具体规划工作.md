Xinhua News Agency report:

    Various counties in Fujian Province are universally carrying out investigation and planning work in order to enable the vast majority of agricultural cooperatives to catch up with or surpass the production level of well-to-do middle peasants within three to five years. The typical investigation and planning work in ten counties, including Zhao'an, Dongshan, Nan'jing, and Longxi in the Longxi Special District, has been completed. Among the 1,630 agricultural cooperatives in these ten counties, 580 cooperatives had reached or exceeded the production level of well-to-do middle peasants last year, increasing to 801 this year. It is planned to increase this number to 1,157 next year and to 1,607 by 1961.

    The materials from the investigations in various types of townships and agricultural cooperatives show that, although well-to-do middle peasants in various places have more, better, and stronger advantages than ordinary peasants in terms of land, water conservancy, draught cattle, farm implements, fertilizer, labor, and sideline production, and have higher production levels and more income, as long as the agricultural cooperatives are good at leveraging the superiority of collective management, vigorously carry out basic construction such as farmland water conservancy in accordance with local conditions, increase fertilizer accumulation, implement the principles of diligence and frugality in running the cooperatives and democratic operation, promote advanced production techniques and experiences, and develop diversified production with grain as the mainstay, it is entirely possible to catch up with or surpass the production level of well-to-do middle peasants within three to five years.

    According to investigations of twenty-nine agricultural cooperatives in different areas in mountainous, semi-mountainous, and plain areas of nine counties, including Shaowu, Shanghang, Minhou, and Zhangpu, in the first year of establishing advanced cooperatives last year, seven cooperatives already had an average income per member that reached or exceeded the level of well-to-do middle peasants, and four cooperatives were close to the level of well-to-do middle peasants. In terms of grain yield per unit area, twelve cooperatives reached or exceeded the level of well-to-do middle peasants, and eight cooperatives were close to the level of well-to-do middle peasants.

    福建各地进行具体规划工作
    据新华社讯　福建省各县普遍进行调查和规划工作，以便在三、五年内使绝大部分农业社都能赶上或超过富裕中农的生产水平。龙溪专区的诏安、东山、南靖和龙溪等十个县的典型调查和规划工作已经结束。十个县一千六百三十个农业社中，去年赶上或超过富裕中农生产水平的农业社已有五百八十个，今年增加到八百零一个，计划明年增加到一千一百五十七个，到1961年增加到一千六百零七个。
    各县在各种类型乡和农业社调查的材料说明，尽管各地富裕中农由于土地、水利、耕牛、农具、肥料、劳力和副业生产等方面都比一般农民多、好、强，生产水平较高，收入较多，但是只要农业社善于发挥集体经营的优越性，因地制宜地大力进行农田水利等基本建设，增积肥料，贯彻勤俭办社和民主办社方针，推广先进生产技术经验，发展以粮食为主的多种生产，完全有可能在三、五年内赶上或超过富裕中农生产水平。
    据邵武、上杭、闽侯和漳浦等九个县山区、半山区和平原地区的二十九个不同地区农业社的调查，在去年建立高级社的第一年，就已有七个社社员每人平均收入赶上或超过富裕中农水平，有四个社接近富裕中农水平。在粮食单位面积产量方面，则有十二个社赶上或超过富裕中农水平，有八个社接近富裕中农水平。
