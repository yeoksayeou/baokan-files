The lamentable "Interdependence"
Commentator of this newspaper

In the communique of the Washington talks held not long ago, Eisenhower and Macmillan put forward the principles of "interdependence" and "united cooperation" of Western countries with special emphasis. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) countries are preparing to adjust their relations with each other according to this principle. But what is the real relationship between the NATO countries hidden behind the pleasant words of "interdependence" and "united cooperation"? The recent turmoil caused by the issue of arms supply to Tunisia is a good illustration.

On November 14, Washington and London separately announced that they would supply arms to Tunisia. This caused a fierce reaction in Paris. French Prime Minister Félix Gaillard hurriedly met with the ambassadors of the United States and Britain at two o'clock in the morning and lodged a "verbal protest" to them. Foreign Minister Pineau decided to go to Washington immediately to negotiate with Dulles. The French delegation attending the third annual meeting of the NATO Parliamentary Assembly even openly stated that "the Atlantic solidarity needed by all members of this meeting is no longer meaningful" and announced its withdrawal from the meeting. The situation developed to such an extent that the American "Associated Press" also believed that "this is the most serious crisis in the eight-year history of this Atlantic organization."

This storm is certainly not an accident. It is an outbreak of the long-standing contradictions between the United States, Britain, and France in North Africa.

In recent years, under the impact of the great wave of national independence movements of the people in North Africa, French colonial rule has been crumbling. The United States has been trying to take the opportunity to replace France's position in North Africa. It was only afraid that being too hasty would upset France that it has temporarily refrained from launching a large-scale offensive into North Africa.

So why did the United States suddenly decide to supply arms to Tunisia now? Originally, France's current financial crisis is deepening, and it is eager to borrow money from the United States to overcome the difficulties. Therefore, the United States feels that it can use this opportunity to open the door to North Africa from Tunisia. According to Western news agencies, U.S. Ambassador to France Amory Houghton suddenly interrupted the discussion of financial issues between the two countries as a means of coercion before notifying French Prime Minister Félix Gaillard of the decision to supply arms to Tunisia. However, because France regards North Africa as its lifeblood and is unwilling to let this region fall into the hands of the United States so easily, such a fierce dispute has occurred.

This is not the first time that a crisis has erupted between member states of NATO due to conflicts over the sphere of influence. The Cyprus issue caused fierce quarrels, and the "Eisenhower Doctrine" once caused serious "rifts." Obviously, in this group composed of countries full of conflicting interests, there is no united cooperation at all, only mutual infighting and intrigue, or, under the guise of "united cooperation," those allies of the United States are firmly tied to the chariot of Wall Street's monopoly groups.

For France, the facts are now very clear. Trying to "interdepend" with the United States to maintain its colonial interests is like seeking skin from a tiger, and it will not get any good results. If France wants to improve its position in North Africa, there is only one way: abandon its colonial policy and establish new relations with North African countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit.

    可悲的“互相依赖”
    本报评论员
    艾森豪威尔和麦克米伦在不久前举行的华盛顿会谈的公报中，用特别强调的语气提出了西方国家“互相依赖”和“团结合作”的原则。北大西洋集团国家正准备根据这个原则来调整它们相互之间的关系。但是，掩盖在“互相依赖”和“团结合作”这些动听的言辞后面的北大西洋集团国家之间真正的关系是什么呢？最近由供应突尼斯军火问题所引起的一场风波是一个很好的说明。
    11月14日，华盛顿和伦敦分别宣布要向突尼斯供应军火。这在巴黎引起了激烈的反应。法国总理盖伊阿在深夜两点钟匆忙地接见美英两国大使，向他们提出了“口头抗议”。外交部长比诺决定，马上要赶到华盛顿去找杜勒斯交涉。正在参加北大西洋集团议员会议第三届年会的法国代表团甚至公开提出“寻找这次会议的所有成员所需要的大西洋团结再没有意义了”，而宣布退出这次会议。事情发展到这样的地步，以致美国的“合众社”也认为“这是这个大西洋组织八年历史中最严重的危机”。
    这场风波当然不是什么偶然事件。它是美英法三国在北非由来已久的矛盾的一次爆发。
    近年来，在北非人民民族独立运动巨浪的冲击下，法国的殖民统治正在摇摇欲坠。美国一直想乘机取代法国在北非的地位。只是怕操之过急会把法国惹翻，才暂时没有大举向北非进军。
    那末，为什么美国现在又突然决定向突尼斯供应军火了呢？原来，法国目前财政危机日益加深，急于向美国贷款来度过难关，因此美国就感到可以利用这个机会来从突尼斯打开北非的大门。据西方通讯社透露，美国驻法大使阿莫里·霍顿在把关于供应突尼斯军火的决定通知法国总理盖伊阿前，就突然中断了两国之间财政问题的讨论，作为一种要挟手段。但是，由于法国把北非看作自己的命根子，不甘心让这个地区这样轻易地转到美国手里，于是就发生了这样激烈的争吵。
    在北大西洋集团的成员国之间，由于争夺势力范围的冲突而爆发的危机这并不是第一次了。塞浦路斯问题引起过激烈的争吵，“艾森豪威尔主义”也曾经造成过严重的“裂痕”。显然，在这个由充满利害冲突的国家组成的集团中，根本没有什么团结合作，有的只是互相倾轧和勾心斗角，或者是在“团结合作”的美名下那些美国的盟国被华尔街的垄断集团牢牢地缚在他们的战车上。
    对法国说来，现在事实已经很清楚了，想和美国“互相依赖”来维护自己的殖民利益，就如同与虎谋皮一样，是不会得到什么好结果的。法国如果要改善在北非的地位，办法只有一个，那就是：放弃自己的殖民政策，在平等互利的基础上和北非国家建立新的关系。
