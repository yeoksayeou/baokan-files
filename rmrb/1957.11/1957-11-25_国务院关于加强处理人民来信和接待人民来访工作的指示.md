Instruction of the State Council on Strengthening the Handling of People's Letters and Visits

    Handling people's letters and receiving people's visits is a regular and important political task for state organs at all levels. In our country, the people express various demands and wishes, offer opinions on various tasks, and criticize some staff members by writing letters to government organs and requesting meetings and talks. This is a democratic right of the people and a method for the people to supervise the work of the government. Our state organs must protect this democratic right of the people, listen to the people's opinions, and accept the people's supervision. Practical experience has also proven that earnestly handling people's letters and receiving people's visits has great benefits: it can regularly establish contact with thousands of people, understand the emotions and demands of all classes and strata; it can publicize policies, educate the masses, and correctly handle contradictions among the people based on these situations, and timely solve some prominent problems in current work. This can help leading organs discover problems at any time, overcome bureaucracy, and improve work.

    State organs at all levels have established work on handling people's letters and receiving people's visits for a long time, made many achievements, and accumulated some experience, but there are also many shortcomings in the work. Since the unfolding of the rectification movement this year, the majority of provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government have convened work conferences and taken other specific measures to implement the spirit of anti-bureaucracy, examined the work of handling people's letters and receiving people's visits, improved the ideological understanding of cadres, and improved work, and some have already made relatively significant achievements. This is a very good phenomenon. However, at present, the efforts in this area are not enough, and the changes are not resolute or thorough enough. In many organs, the phenomenon of accumulating or losing people's letters, shying away from responsibility, and not being responsible for solving problems still exists in large numbers; some organs still adopt completely wrong methods such as "too busy to handle matters, unavailable for meetings" when dealing with people's letters and visits; some organs and grassroots units still hastily copy and forward various opinions raised by the masses in the rectification and airing of views without careful study; in some areas, leading organs have not seriously grasped this matter, have not taken specific measures to combat bureaucracy, and have not shown the determination and courage to earnestly improve work. This situation is contrary to the spirit of the rectification movement. Our state organs at all levels must implement the spirit of boldly, resolutely, and thoroughly improving work in the rectification movement, earnestly strengthen the handling of people's letters and receiving people's visits, and fully play its role, so as to more effectively closely contact the masses, overcome bureaucracy, and strengthen leadership over the cause of socialist construction.

    For this reason, the following instructions are now given:

    1. People's committees of all provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government, all departments of the Central Government, and other state organs at all levels must have a leader personally in charge of the handling of people's letters and the reception of people's visits in the organ. The leader in charge of this work should personally handle some of the letters from the masses, receive some of the visiting masses, help cadres accumulate experience, improve work, and supervise and guide this work in subordinate units. In addition, other leaders in the organs should also take time to handle a certain number of letters from the masses and receive some of the visiting masses, and regularly care about this work. Experience has proven that the leadership of the organ attaches importance to it and personally takes action is the key to doing a good job in handling people's letters and receiving people's visits.

    2. The work of handling people's letters and receiving people's visits should be based on the principles of promoting people's democracy, closely contacting the masses, and complying with national policies and laws, and satisfying the legitimate demands of the masses as much as possible.

    (1) Criticisms and suggestions made by the masses on various tasks, if they are correct and feasible, should be carefully studied and adopted; if they conflict with current policies or are difficult to implement, explanations should be given and the relevant policies should be publicized.

    (2) Various specific demands raised by the masses, if they are reasonable and can be resolved at present, should be handled in a timely manner by taking effective measures; if they are unreasonable and cannot be resolved at present, patient explanations should be given, and the relevant specific circumstances and actual difficulties should be explained to the masses to obtain the understanding of the masses. In short, whether it is a reasonable demand or an unreasonable demand, it should be handled responsibly, and it should not be handled simply.

    (3) Accusations by the masses of misconduct and violations of laws and disciplines by cadres of state organs should be carefully investigated and handled. When it is necessary to transfer them, they should generally be handed over to the higher-level leading organs or supervisory departments of the accused for handling, and the results should be inquired from the handling department in a timely manner.

    (4) For bad elements and fraudsters who make trouble unreasonably under the guise of people's letters and visits, they should be criticized, educated, or contacted with relevant departments for appropriate handling, depending on the severity of the circumstances.

    3. The work of handling people's letters and receiving people's visits should implement the method of combining special personnel in charge and everyone taking action. People's committees above the county level must have full-time personnel or full-time institutions responsible for establishing systems, organizing division of labor, conducting supervision and inspection, conducting comprehensive research, exchanging experiences, and directly handling some problems. In addition, for the large number of various problems raised by the masses, they must be "handled by designated departments," relying on various business departments and work units to handle them in conjunction with their respective businesses and work. It is necessary for the higher-level leading organs to transfer some letters and visits cases from the masses to the lower-level organs for handling. However, things that they should and can handle themselves should not be transferred downwards. County-level organs and grassroots units below must handle more and transfer less, or only handle and not transfer. It is necessary to earnestly establish a system of responsibility at all levels, oppose the bureaucratic work style and methods of shirking responsibility, being irresponsible, and not solving problems.

    4. A variety of methods should be adopted to handle the problems raised by the masses. For example, entrusting cadres going to the countryside and factories to take cases down and handle relevant issues in conjunction with central work and regular business; assigning certain organizations or organizing forces to conduct special investigations and handle them vigorously for prominent and major issues; conducting comprehensive research, formulating methods, and centrally resolving policy-related issues; mediating and handling some disputes among the masses through mass organizations; publishing criticisms and suggestions made by the masses in newspapers, answering questions of concern to the masses, and announcing the results of the handling of certain issues; compiling opinions raised by the masses into briefs and sending them to leaders and relevant organs for reference, and so on. These are all effective working methods in many places that can be emulated in other places. In addition, more good working methods can be created in practical work.

    5. All organs should establish and improve necessary procedures and systems in the work of handling people's letters and receiving people's visits, so as to eliminate loss, facilitate investigation, and improve work efficiency. These procedures and systems should be suitable for the different situations of various organs, be simple and easy to implement, and should not be forced to be consistent or too cumbersome.

    People's committees of all provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government, and all departments of the Central Government should, in accordance with the above instructions, combine with the rectification movement in their respective regions and departments, thoroughly examine the bureaucracy in the work of handling people's letters and receiving people's visits, and take specific measures to effectively improve work in accordance with the spirit of correctly handling contradictions among the people.

    国务院关于加强处理人民来信和接待人民来访工作的指示
    处理人民来信和接待人民来访，是各级国家机关一项经常的重要政治任务。在我们的国家里，人民群众通过向政府机关写信和要求见面接谈，提出各种要求，表示各种愿望，对各项工作提出意见，对一些工作人员提出批评，这是人民的一种民主权利，是人民监督政府工作的一种方法。我们的国家机关，一定要保护人民的这种民主权利，倾听人民的意见，接受人民的监督。实际经验也证明，认真地处理人民来信和接待人民来访，有很大的好处：可以经常地同成千上万的群众建立联系，了解各阶级、阶层的情绪和要求；可以宣传政策，教育群众，可以根据这些情况正确处理人民内部的矛盾，及时解决当前工作中一些突出的问题，这就能够帮助领导机关随时发现问题，克服官僚主义，改进工作。
    各级国家机关，建立处理人民来信和接待人民来访工作，已经有了很长的时间，做出了很多成绩，积累了一些经验，但是工作中也有许多缺点。在今年整风运动开展以后，多数的省、自治区、直辖市，都经过召开工作会议和采取其他具体措施，贯彻反官僚主义的精神，检查了处理人民来信和接待人民来访工作，提高了干部的思想认识，改进了工作，有些已经做出比较显著的成绩。这是很好的现象。但是，目前在这个方面的努力还不够，还改得不坚决，改得不狠。在许多机关中，积压或者丢失人民来信、互相推诿、不负责解决问题的现象还大量存在；有些机关对待人民来信、来访，还采取“事忙不办，开会不见”等完全错误的办法；有些机关和基层单位，在处理整风鸣放中群众提出的各种意见的时候，仍然是不加认真研究就草率照抄照转；有些地区，领导机关还没有认真地抓这件事，没有采取具体措施同官僚主义现象作斗争，没有表现出认真改进工作的决心和勇气。这种情况，是同整风运动的精神相抵触的。我们各级国家机关，必须在整风运动中贯彻大胆、坚决、彻底改进工作的精神，切实加强处理人民来信和接待人民来访工作，充分发挥它的作用，以便更有成效地密切联系群众，克服官僚主义，加强对社会主义建设事业的领导。
    为此，现在作如下指示：
    一、各省、自治区、直辖市人民委员会，中央各部门，以及其他各级国家机关，都必须有一个领导人亲自掌管机关的处理人民来信和接待人民来访工作。掌管这项工作的领导人，要亲自批办一部分群众来信，接见一些来访群众，帮助干部积累经验，改进工作，并且对所属单位的这项工作进行监督和指导。此外，机关中的其他领导人，也都要抽出时间，批办一定数量的群众来信和接见一些来访群众，经常关心这项工作。经验证明，机关领导人重视和亲自动手去抓，是做好处理人民来信和接待人民来访工作的关键。
    二、处理人民来信和接待人民来访工作，应该以发扬人民民主，密切联系群众，并且遵照国家政策、法令，尽可能满足群众的正当要求为原则。
    （一）群众对于各项工作提出的批评和建议，凡属正确的、可行的，应该认真研究采纳；同当前政策有抵触的或者难以实行的，应该进行解释，并且对有关政策加以宣传。
    （二）群众提出的各种具体要求，凡是合理的目前可以解决的，应该采取有效办法，及时处理；凡是不合理的目前不能解决的，应该耐心地进行解释，把有关的具体情况和实际困难向群众说清楚，取得群众的谅解。总之，不论是合理的要求，或者是不合理的要求，都应该认真负责处理，不得简单从事。
      （三）群众控告国家机关干部不良作风和违法乱纪行为，应该认真检查处理，需要转交的时候，一般的要交给被控告者的上级领导机关或者监察部门处理，并且应该及时向处理部门查问结果。
    （四）对于假借人民来信、来访名义，进行无理取闹的坏分子、诈骗犯，应该根据情节轻重，分别进行批评、教育或者联系有关部门作适当的处理。
    三、处理人民来信和接待人民来访工作，要实行专人负责和大家动手相结合的办法。县以上人民委员会一定要有专职人员或者专职机构，负责建立制度，组织分工，进行督促检查，综合研究，交流经验，并且直接处理一些问题。另外，对于群众提出的大量的各种各样的问题，则必须分别“归口交办”，依靠各个业务部门和工作单位，结合各自的业务和工作进行处理。上级领导机关，将一些群众来信、来访案件转交下级机关处理，是必需的。但是，凡属自己应该办和能够办的事，就不要往下转。县级机关和以下的基层单位，必须多办少转，或者只办不转。要认真建立层层负责的制度，反对互相推诿，不负责任，不解决问题的官僚主义的工作作风和工作方法。
    四、处理群众提出的问题要采取多种多样的方法。例如，委托下乡、下厂干部带案下去，结合中心工作和经常业务，处理有关的问题；对于突出的重大问题，责成一定的组织或者组织力量进行专案调查，大张旗鼓地处理；对于带政策性的问题，进行综合研究，拟定办法，集中地加以解决；通过群众组织，调解和处理群众中的一些纠纷问题；在报纸上登载群众提出的批评和建议，解答群众关心的问题，公布某些问题的处理结果；集中整理群众提出的意见，编成简报，送领导人和各有关机关参考，等等。这些，都是在许多地方行之有效而其他地方也都可以仿行的工作方法。此外，在实际工作中，还可以创造出更多的良好的工作方法。
    五、各个机关，在处理人民来信和接待人民来访工作中，都应该建立和健全必要的手续和制度，以达到杜绝丢失，便于稽查，提高工作效率等目的。这些手续和制度，应该适合各种不同机关各自的情况，简便易行，不能强求一致，过于繁琐。
    各省、自治区、直辖市人民委员会，中央各部门，应该按照上述指示，结合本地区、本部门的整风运动，彻底检查处理人民来信和接待人民来访工作中的官僚主义，并且根据正确处理人民内部矛盾的精神，采取具体措施，切实改进工作。
