    Mr. Moogan Needs a "Passport"
    Yan Ling
    In this world, there are actually people so utterly consumed and possessed by the desire for private ownership.
    According to a news dispatch from Chicago on November 3rd, a man named James Moogan, living there, is at it again with his nonsense. The dispatch said: "James Moogan, who calls himself the owner of all property rights in outer space, said today that the second Russian satellite carrying a dog is more reason for panic than anything since the first atomic bomb." What made him so "panicked"? Moogan said, "The launch of two satellites indicates that the Russians have a plan, according to which they will eventually send a rocket to the moon, and later they may launch rocket ships carrying Russians to the moon." The more amazing thing is yet to come: "But if the Russians get to the moon, their ownership claims will certainly be vague, because they don't have passports through celestial space." It is said that Mr. Moogan had earlier "accused the Russians" of "invading" the sky with the first satellite!
    I remember, there was indeed such a thing, which happened between 1949 and 1950.
    On March 3, 1950, the US State Department issued a statement: The delegation of the World Peace Congress was not allowed to go to the United States to appeal for peace to the US Congress. US Congressman McCormick, one of the leaders of the Democratic Party, even croaked: The idea of the US Congress accepting a peace appeal is simply "extremely arrogant." At that time, I wrote a brief note on reading the newspaper about this, in which I talked about the "famous" thing that Mr. Moogan did:
     "Here is a typical example of 'extremely arrogant' - a Mr. James Moogan in Chicago, USA, applied to the Illinois Attorney General for registration, requesting to be the owner of the entire sky, including planets and comets; moreover, the Attorney General registered him without hesitation. Because American law recognizes: Whoever is the first to discover any land, this place can belong to him. He also wrote to the United Nations Secretariat, requesting permission to speak at the United Nations General Assembly as a representative of the 'sovereign space nation.' Naturally, the United Nations Secretariat was unable to give him a satisfactory answer, so he held a press conference, declaring: 'From now on, no one on Earth is allowed to go to the moon or any planet without Moogan's consent! Especially the Russians.' - In a country of arrogance, under arrogant laws, in an arrogant atmosphere, such an arrogant 'arrogant person' has grown up! It is not enough to dream of enslaving the whole world, and they still dream of putting iron chains on every planet!"
    "There are too many examples of American officials being 'extremely arrogant.' Last year (1949), a James named Forrest went crazy because he was afraid of the forces of peace and committed suicide by jumping off a building; and now, this James named Moogan is so arrogant that he wants to prevent the spread of peaceful thoughts to planets outside the earth as early as possible. And their partners turned around and said that those who ask for peace are 'arrogant.' - Naturally, in the eyes of people in the lunatic asylum, people outside the lunatic asylum are lunatics." (See "People's Daily," March 14, 1950)
  　Now, two artificial satellites are roaming in space, spreading the gospel of democracy and peace to all mankind, and emitting the light of socialism. They are also flying over the sky above Mr. Moogan's head, neither bothering to say hello to Mr. Moogan, nor asking Mr. Moogan for a "passport." Mr. Moogan and his partners have no way to put an iron curtain on the road to the moon.
    Why are the Americans, who shout that their "science and technology are the most advanced," unable to launch even the smallest artificial satellite, and yet are panicking about the two artificial satellites that have already flown into the sky? From this, we can also find an important answer: There, people put their minds on how to expand their private desires; there, the social system is only to protect the private rights of a very few people and encourage people to pursue their personal interests. And in the place where two artificial satellites have already risen from, people have become accustomed to putting the collective public interest first, and people's labor and wisdom are harmoniously organized into a whole, and countless people have become a giant.
    When this giant strides towards the stars with heroic steps, what an embarrassing clown's role James Moogan is playing! Mr. Moogan may get such a "glory" that his "deeds" may become a small joke that can help digestion and is popular in the second half of the twentieth century, circulating among people, and soon after, circulating to the stars.

### 毛根先生要“护照”

    毛根先生要“护照”
    燕凌
    在世界上，居然有被私有的欲望弄得如此神魂颠倒、鬼迷心窍的人。
    据11月3日芝加哥传来的消息，住在那个地方的一个姓毛根名为杰姆斯的人又在说胡话了。消息说：“杰姆斯·毛根这个自称为对外层空间一切拥有所有权的人今天说，俄国载有狗的第二颗卫星比自第一枚原子弹以来的任何东西更有理由引起恐慌。”为什么使他如此“恐慌”呢？毛根说，“发射两颗卫星这件事表明俄国人有一项计划，根据这一计划终于会把火箭送到月亮上去的，而以后可能发射火箭船把俄国人载送到月亮上去。”更妙的话还在后边：“但是如果俄国搞到月亮上，他们的所有权要求肯定是模糊的，因为他们没有通过天体空间的护照。”据说，这位毛根先生早些时候还曾“控诉俄国人”以第一颗卫星“侵入”天空呢！
    我想起来了，的确有过这么一回事，发生在1949年和1950年间。
    1950年3月3日，美国国务院发表了一个声明：不许世界拥护和平大会代表团到美国去向美国国会呼吁和平。美国众院议员、民主党党魁之一考米克还哑着嗓子叫嚣：要美国国会接受和平呼吁的想法，真是“狂妄极了”。当时，我曾为此写了一则读报随笔，里面谈到过这位毛根先生干的那件“有名”的事：
      “这里有一个‘狂妄极了’的典型——美国芝加哥城有一位叫做杰姆斯·毛根的先生，他向伊里诺州的检察长申请备案，要求作为整个天空，包括行星、彗星的所有人；而且，检察官毫不迟疑地给他备了案。因为美国法律承认：凡是第一个发现任何土地的人，这地方就可以属于他。他还写信给联合国秘书处，要求准许他以‘主权太空国家’代表的身份到联合国大会讲话。自然，联合国秘书处没有能够给他以满意的答复，于是他就举行记者招待会，宣称：‘今后地球上不论何人如未得毛根同意，绝对不许到月球或任何星球上去！特别是俄罗斯人。’——狂妄的国度中，狂妄的法律下、狂妄的空气里，才孳生出了如此狂妄的‘狂妄家’！奴役全世界的梦做得还不够过瘾，还梦想把铁锁链套上每一个星球！”
    “美国官员们‘狂妄极了’的例子是太多了，他们除了发疯，就是狂妄。去年（1949年），姓福莱斯特的那位杰姆斯因为害怕和平力量而发疯以至跳楼自杀；而今，这位姓毛根的杰姆斯则狂妄到想要及早阻止和平思想传到地球以外的星球上去。而他们的伙伴却反说要求和平的人‘狂妄’。——自然，在疯人院里的人的眼睛里，疯人院以外的人都是疯子。”（见1950年3月14日“人民日报”）
  　而今，两颗人造卫星正在太空遨游，向全人类散布着民主和平的福音，发射着社会主义的光芒。它们也在毛根先生头顶的天空飞过，既不屑于向毛根先生打招呼，也不向毛根先生要一张“护照”。毛根先生和他的伙伴们，一点也没办法把通向月球的路上安置一道铁幕。
    为什么大叫大嚷着自己的“科学技术最先进”的美国人，却连最小的人造卫星也放不出去，而又为已经飞上天去的两颗人造卫星而惊慌？从这里也可以寻出一个重要的答案来：在那里，人们把心思都用在怎样扩大私欲上边；在那里，社会制度只是为了保护极少数人的私有权和鼓励人们追逐个人的利益。而在已有两颗人造卫星从那里升起的地方，人们已经习惯于把集体的公共的利益放在第一位，人们的劳动和智慧谐调地组织成了一个整体，无数的人变成了一个巨人。
    当这个巨人跨着豪迈的步伐走向星际的时候，杰姆斯·毛根在扮演着一个多么尴尬的小丑的角色！毛根先生也许能得到这样一份“光荣”，他的这件“事迹”，可能会成为在二十世纪后半期盛行的一个颇能助消化的小笑话，流传在人间，不久之后，再流传到星际。
