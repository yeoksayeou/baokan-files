　　Scientists were attending a celebration of the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution, and had just finished listening to astronomer Li Heng's report on the first Soviet artificial satellite, when they received this unexpected good news. When the news of the Soviet Union's launch of the second artificial satellite, issued by Xinhua News Agency, was read out at the meeting, the whole audience applauded warmly, and every sentence of the news evoked bursts of admiration. Ren Hongjun, chairman of the Shanghai Science and Technology Association and chairman of the conference, said excitedly: We can fully believe that the ideal of human travel to the stars will soon be realized. The amazing achievements of the Soviet Union in science and technology have further encouraged our confidence in learning from the Soviet Union.

　　Thousands of workers celebrating the October Revolution Festival at the Workers' Cultural Palace heard the good news, and their enthusiasm was even higher. The song and dance party immediately sang "Moscow-Beijing" to express their congratulations on the second artificial satellite. A group of workers visiting the "Great Achievements of Soviet Science" photo exhibition applauded repeatedly. They said: This artificial satellite is heavier, flies higher, and has animals on it. The development of Soviet science is really progressing rapidly.

　　At the Children's Palace, more than 600 children who were having a get-together with Soviet experts suddenly saw two children carrying out huge "囍" characters. The counselor announced to the children: There is one more friend in the sky, and the Soviet Union launched the second artificial satellite today.
