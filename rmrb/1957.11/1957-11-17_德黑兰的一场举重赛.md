The 1957 World Weightlifting Championships, which concluded on November 12 in Tehran, the capital of Iran, once again confirmed the absolute dominance of Soviet weightlifting in the world. In the seven weight classes, Soviet athletes won six first places and one second place; the middleweight competitor Bogdanovsky tied with the American Kono in the total weight lifted. Kono, the light heavyweight champion of the Sixteenth Olympic Games, reduced his weight this time to compete in the middleweight class. He was more than half a kilogram lighter than Bogdanovsky, so he won the championship in this class.

According to the World Weightlifting Championships rules, the first-place winner in each class gets five points, the second-place winner gets three points, and the third-place winner gets one point. The American team and the Iranian team each scored nine points, while the Soviet team scored thirty-three points.

Some say that the United States did not send all of its best weightlifters this year, allowing the Soviet Union to win easily. Is this the case?

American weightlifting is in a slump this year. The heavyweight Anderson has turned professional, and the flyweight Olympic champion, Vinci, did not travel with the team because he is about to become a father. The light heavyweight Olympic runner-up Shepol is said to have been arrested for fighting drunk in the street.

However, the great progress shown by Soviet weightlifters in Tehran cannot be said to be a fluke victory due to incomplete opponents. The most powerful proof is that Soviet athletes swept all seven new world records created in this competition.

On the 13th, even Tsimichkian, a reserve athlete on the Soviet team, broke two world records.

It is no exaggeration to say that after the Soviet Union selected its seven best representatives, a second team composed of the remaining athletes could still defeat any team in this world competition.

Now let's review the situation of this competition: In the flyweight competition, the Soviet Union's Stogov jerked 107.5 kilograms, snatched 105 kilograms, and clean and jerked 132.5 kilograms, for a total of 345 kilograms. The snatch was a world record, and the total also broke Vinci's world record of 342.5 kilograms.

Before the featherweight competition, Western newspapers almost unanimously predicted that the American world record holder Berger could defeat Minayev. Their basis was that Berger defeated Minayev with 352.5 kilograms at the Sixteenth Olympic Games. Berger’s press was only 107.5 kilograms at that time, but not long ago he pressed 117 kilograms in a competition in Israel.

Who knew that Minayev had made amazing progress. The total weight he lifted that day was 362.5 kilograms, exceeding Berger's world record by 20 kilograms.

In the lightweight competition, the Soviet world record holder Bushuyev won first place without any strong opponents threatening him. His total was 380 kilograms, 5 kilograms less than his own world record. Lightweight is the weakest link for the United States. The American champion Pittman only achieved a score of 342.5 kilograms.

In the middleweight class, the Soviet Union's Bogdanovsky and the United States' Kono competed fiercely, and as a result, both lifted 420 kilograms.

In the light heavyweight class, the Soviet Union's Romakin defeated the United States' Jim George with a total of 450 kilograms, taking first place and breaking Kono's world record of 447.5 kilograms.

In the middle heavyweight class, the Soviet Union's Vorobyov once again retained his world champion title, with a total of 470 kilograms, breaking the world record of 462.5 kilograms.

In the heavyweight competition, the Soviet Union's Medvedev defeated Argentina's Silvetti with a total of 500 kilograms, becoming the third strongman in the world to lift 500 kilograms, after Anderson and Silvetti.

Everyone knows that the International Weightlifting Federation, ignoring our country's protests, accepted the participation of Taiwanese athletes this time. In order to oppose the conspiracy to create two Chinas, our weightlifters did not participate in the competition. Now, we can compare the results of this competition with the strength of our athletes. The rapid progress made by Chinese weightlifting in recent years surprised some Westerners who saw Chinese weightlifters perform for the first time at the Third International Youth Friendship Games. Judging from the speed of progress of Chinese weightlifters in recent years, and the good conditions prepared by the Party and the state for popularizing and improving this sport, it is not impossible for the Chinese team to reach the third place in the world.

The third place in this competition was the host country Iran. Judging from the results achieved by Iran's seven athletes in this competition, their current strength is slightly stronger than China's. For example, the runner-up in the flyweight class, Iran's Songbouli, scored 327.5 kilograms. The best result of our athlete Chen Jingkai is currently 322.5 kilograms. It should be said that Chen Jingkai still has a lot of untapped potential.

In the featherweight class, China's Xu Honglin achieved a score of 327.5 kilograms. Iran did not have any athletes participating in this class.

In the lightweight class, the Soviet Union had three athletes reach 380 kilograms. However, the International Weightlifting Federation passed a resolution that each country can only have one athlete in each class in the future. In this way, China's Huang Qianghui and Bulgaria's Abajayev, with a strength of 372.5 kilograms, are likely to win the second place. Huang Qianghui's clean and jerk is also likely to improve to more than 150 kilograms. And the Iranian athlete Tomraz's score is 360 kilograms.

In the middleweight class, Iran's Tehrani and China's Zhu Hongquan both achieved a score of 370 kilograms.

Light Heavyweight: Iran's Mansouri's total score is 412.5 kilograms. Zhao Qingkui can reach this score under normal circumstances.

In the middle heavyweight class, Iran's Lanafati won the world runner-up this time, with a score of 440 kilograms. The total score of China's middle heavyweight athlete Li Baiyu is 415 kilograms. The heavyweight athlete Chang Guanqun is relatively weak with only 377.5 kilograms.

Therefore, it is certainly not easy for China to catch up with the traditional weightlifting power, Iran, but among China's various sports, weightlifting is the fastest growing. Judging from the speed of progress, we have the possibility and confidence to take surpassing Iran as the first step towards advancing to the world weightlifting level.

    德黑兰的一场举重赛
    新华社记者  李郁文
    11月12日在伊朗首都德黑兰结束的1957年世界举重锦标赛又一次证实了苏联举重运动在世界上的绝对优势。在七个等级的比赛中，苏联选手赢得了六个第一，一个第二；而获得第二的中量级选手鲍格达诺夫斯基和美国的科诺举起的重量相等。科诺是十六届奥林匹克运动会轻重量级冠军，这次他减轻了体重，降一级参加中量级的比赛，他的体重比鲍格达诺夫斯基轻半公斤多，所以获得这一级的冠军。
    按世界举重锦标赛规则，以获得每一级比赛第一名的选手得五分，第二名得三分，第三名得一分来计算，美国队和伊朗队各得九分，而苏联队得三十三分。
    有人说，美国今年没有派出它的全部举重好手，所以让苏联轻易取胜，是不是这样呢？
    美国的举重运动今年是不景气的。重量级的安徒逊转为职业举重运动员，最轻级奥运会冠军温奇因为最近要做爸爸了，没有随队远征。次重级奥运会亚军歇泊尔据说因为喝醉酒在大街上打架而被逮捕。
    但是，苏联举重家在德黑兰显示的巨大进步，决不能说是由于对手残缺不全，侥幸取得胜利。苏联选手包办了这次比赛中创造的全部七项世界新纪录，是最有力的证明。
    在13日，甚至于苏联队的后备选手齐米希基安也打破了两项世界纪录。
    可以毫不夸张地说，在苏联选拔了七名最优秀的代表以后，由其余的选手组成一个第二队，仍然可以战胜这次世界比赛中的任何一队。
    现在让我们回顾一下这次比赛的情形吧：在最轻级比赛当中，苏联的斯托戈夫推举一○七点五公斤，抓举一百零五公斤，挺举一三二点五公斤，总成绩是三百四十五公斤，其中抓举成绩是一项世界纪录，总成绩也打破了温奇的三四二点五公斤的世界纪录。
    在次轻级比赛以前，西方报纸几乎一致预测美国的世界纪录保持者伯吉尔可以战胜米纳耶夫。它们的根据是，伯吉尔在十六届奥运会上以三五二点五公斤打败了米纳耶夫，伯吉尔当时推举只到达一○七点五公斤，而不久以前他在以色列的一次比赛中推起了一百一十七公斤。
    那知道米纳耶夫已经取得了惊人的进步。他当天举起的总成绩是三百六十二点五公斤，超出伯吉尔的世界纪录二十公斤之多。
    在轻量级比赛当中，苏联的世界纪录保持者布舒耶夫没有受到任何强敌的威胁，就取得了第一名。他的总成绩是三百八十公斤，比他本人的世界纪录少五公斤。轻量级是美国最弱的一环，美国冠军匹脱门的成绩只有三百四十二点五公斤。
    在中量级里，苏联的鲍格达诺夫斯基和美国的科诺经过激烈的竞赛，结果两个人都举起了四百二十公斤。
    在轻重量级，苏联的罗玛金以四百五十公斤的总成绩战胜美国的吉姆·乔治，获得第一，并且刷新了科诺保持的四百四十七点五公斤的世界纪录。
    在次重量级，苏联的沃罗比耶夫又一次保持了本人的世界冠军称号，总成绩是四百七十公斤，打破了四百六十二点五公斤的世界纪录。
    在重量级比赛当中，苏联的梅德维捷夫以五百公斤的总成绩战胜了阿根廷的西尔维蒂，成为继安徒逊、西尔维蒂以后，世界上第三个举起五百公斤的大力士。
    大家知道国际举重联合会这次由于不顾我国的抗议，接受台湾选手参加，为了反对制造两个中国的阴谋，我国举重运动员没有参加比赛。现在，我们可以把这次比赛的成绩和我国运动员的实力比较一下。中国举重运动几年来获得的飞跃的进步使在第三届国际青年友谊运动会上第一次看到中国举重家表演的一些西方人士大吃一惊。从中国举重选手近年来进步的速度来说，以及党和国家为了普及和提高这项运动所准备的良好条件来说，中国队达到世界第三位，不是不可能的。
    在这次比赛中得第三的是东道国伊朗。以伊朗的七名选手在这次比赛中取得的成绩来看，目前他们的实力比中国稍微强一些。像这次最轻级亚军伊朗的宋鲍利的成绩是三百二十七点五公斤。我国选手陈镜开目前的最好成绩是三百二十二点五公斤，应该说陈镜开还有好些潜在力量没有发挥。
    次轻量级中国的徐鸿林达到三百二十七点五公斤的成绩。伊朗没有选手参加这级比赛。
    在轻量级里，苏联有三名选手达到三百八十公斤。不过这次国际举重联合会通过一项决议，以后每个国家在每一级只能有一名选手。这样，中国的黄强辉和保加利亚的阿巴杰耶夫以三百七十二点五公斤的实力都有可能夺取第二名。黄强辉的挺举还有可能提高到一百五十公斤以上。而伊朗的选手汤姆拉兹的成绩是三百六十公斤。
    在中量级里，伊朗的德黑兰尼和中国的朱鸿全的成绩都是三百七十公斤。
    轻重量级：伊朗的曼苏里的总成绩是四百一十二点五公斤。赵庆奎在正常情况下，可以达到这个成绩。
    在次重量级，伊朗的拉那伐蒂这次获得世界亚军，成绩是四百四十公斤。中国的次重级选手李白玉的总成绩是四百一十五公斤。重量级选手常冠群的实力较差只有三百七十七点五公斤。
    所以，中国要赶上传统的举重强国——伊朗当然不是很容易的事情，可是在中国的各种体育项目中，举重是进步最快的一项，从进步的速度来看，我们有可能也有信心把超过伊朗作为向世界举重水平迈进的第一步。  （本报特约稿）
