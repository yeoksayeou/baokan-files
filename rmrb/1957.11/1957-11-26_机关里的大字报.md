Big-Character Posters in Government Offices

    Is it necessary to establish the Tianjin Administration Bureau?
    In order to "strengthen" the leadership of coal mines in the Hebei area, the Ministry established the Tianjin Administration Bureau to lead Kailuan, Jingxi, Fengfeng, Jingxing, and Xinglong. It seems that the Ministry has reduced a lot of trouble, but in reality, it has doubled the trouble for the lower levels and further aggravated the Ministry's bureaucracy—not getting close to the grassroots. For example, if the Jingxi Mining Bureau encounters certain problems, it has to go to Tianjin first and then return to the Ministry. If the Beijing Municipal Party Committee wants to study the problems of Jingxi, it has to find the Tianjin Administration Bureau. Wouldn't it be better to directly ask the Ministry and contact the Ministry in the past? Jingxing, Fengfeng, and Kailuan are not far from Beijing either. What's wrong with the Ministry leading them? Just give the mining bureaus some more power.
    After the establishment of the Tianjin Administration Bureau, some bureau chiefs, section chiefs, and technical cadres were transferred from subordinate bureaus to the Administration Bureau, which is bound to weaken the strength of the grassroots. Isn't this contrary to the spirit of reducing levels and strengthening grassroots leadership repeatedly instructed by the Central Government?
    Recently, the Central Government has also instructed to streamline institutions with a revolutionary spirit. Please also consider this issue, Party Leadership Group!

    The Merged Organization is Still Two Separate Entities
    It has been more than half a year since the Cadre Department and the Education Department merged into the Cadre and Education Department, but to this day, it is still not worthy of its name, and the organization has not been thoroughly merged. There are two director's offices (one in the east, one in the west), two secretarial groups, and of course, two secretaries and three dispatchers. Official documents are also handled with two sets of procedures. There are two official seals and six telephones in use. During the Rectification Campaign, although there is one leading group, there are still two offices. Although there is one branch, sometimes only half a branch meeting is held.
    There are also problems with the merging of sections and divisions. For example, the Planning and Coordination section has been merged into one section, but now it is working in three different places, partly with the Training Division, partly with the Personnel Division of the organ. The Training Division is also one entity in the east and one in the west, which is very inconvenient for work.
    Why can't the above situation be unified and resolved? I think there is no determination to merge. If there is determination, it should be merged quickly.

     机关里的大字报
    设立天津管理局必要吗？
    部为了“加强”对河北地区煤矿的领导，成立了天津管理局，领导开滦、京西、峰峰、井陉和兴隆几个单位。看起来部里减少了不少麻烦，实际上是加倍的增加了下边的麻烦，并且更加重了部的官僚主义——不接近基层。如京西矿务局遇到某些问题，还得先去天津，再返回来到部，北京市委要研究京西的问题，还得找天津管理局。过去直接请示部和与部联系不更好吗？井陉、峰峰、开滦离北京也并不远，由部领导有甚么不好？只要把权力分给矿务局一些就可以了。
    天津管理局成立后，由所属局抽调了一些局长、处长和技术干部到管理局，势必要削弱基层的力量。这与中央所一再指示的减少层次和加强基层的领导的精神不是背道而驰吗？
    最近中央又指示，要以革命的精神紧缩机构，这个问题也请党组考虑考虑！

    机构合并仍是两摊
    干部司和教育司合并为干教司，已经半年多了，可是到今天还名不符其实，机构仍没彻底合起来。有两个司长室
  （东边一个，西边一个），两个秘书组，当然也是两个秘书三个收发。办理公文也是两套手续，现用两个公章六台电话机。在整风运动中，领导小组虽是一个，但办公室却又是两个。支部虽是一个，但有时却开半个支部大会。
    在处科合并上也有问题。如计划和调配合为一个科，现在是分在三处办公，一部分和培训处在一起，一部分和机关人事在一起，培训处也是东边一摊，西边一摊，工作很不方便。
    以上情况为甚么不能统一和解决呢？我认为是没有合并的决心，如果有决心，就应迅速合并起来。
