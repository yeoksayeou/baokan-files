    Forty Years Ago and Forty Years Later
    Wang Tongzhao
    (Suffering from severe tracheitis and arthritis, my hand trembled and I was short of breath, but I managed to complete this poem in one go. After writing, I rested in bed for half a day, but my mind was clear and my spirits were good. Attached note.)

Less than half a century, barely a person's middle age,
How much struggle and suffering have we experienced, enduring torment on frozen ground and amidst poisonous flames!
Wind cannot topple it, thunder cannot break it, no amount of countercurrents or undercurrents can swallow
This towering like a mountain—this towering like a mountain Red Star
Standing tall in the northern plains of the world, high mountains, great rivers, forests, fields, villages,
And cities all gleaming with red light. Gathering inward, expanding outward,
Passing on to the endless future, extending, realizing humanity's highest ideals, the greatest
Reality, the fairest life on this land of ice, snow, hunger, and cold.
Pacifying internally, repelling externally, and struggling for food and production, staking blood and flesh, advancing
Forward bravely. This trail of blood,
Can those who come after not open their eyes? This hardship, this pain,...
How can it be compared to ordinary things! Here is iron discipline, fiery passion, mirror-like analysis,
And the will to move mountains and fill seas. Not looking back; not bowing to difficulties, and even unafraid of temporary
Natural disasters and human calamities. For humanity, for truth, for the realization of fair ideals, - to open
The door to socialism first, and then enter the paradise of communism!
For forty years, there has been history, records, bloodstains,
Sweat,
And even more remarkably, all kinds of achievements. You can compare, measure, ponder, these forty years
Of achievements and previous sufferings! From a backward, illiterate, autocratic, and corrupt Tsarist Russia,
A subtle change, a sudden transformation, scattering red light from the darkness. Through much struggle, we were able
To lead industry and agriculture onto new fronts; only then could education, science, and culture write
Brand new poems. The abundance of the masses' lives, the development of remote areas, the progress of all trades and industries,
Need not be mentioned, nor need they be demonstrated one by one, the world shares in hearing and seeing, true achievements don't rely on
Propaganda, and progress in production can be seen in the numbers.
Forty years! Now we have launched intercontinental missiles,
Artificial Earth satellites are also appearing in the sky, proof is before us, with just this scientific power,
Can you not sincerely admire! Can you not think about the Soviet Union forty years ago? Missiles and satellites
Are both "stars of fate" for humanity, shining infinitely in the vast sky. Could this be achieved without the socialist system?
Without the organization and leadership of the Communist Party, where would the Soviet Union be these forty years? Saying there's money, there's manpower,
That's not enough, without a good government, people and things are just scattered sand, broken threads. "A single thread does not make a line," "using
Money to fill the void,"
Science and culture both closely follow changes in the government. I, in my early twenties, knew the words "Labor and Peasant Government" and "Broad
Ideology," at the time, they just felt fresh and new, later, I learned a little from books and records, what the "Bolshevik"
Implied, what the new government's purpose
Was, but it was not immediately clear… Now, forty years have passed, all the good effects have been realized; all the political capabilities are spreading everywhere,
Without careful consideration and deep thought, for humanity's lofty purpose; without the Party's leadership and the implementation of its ideology, everything would be a mess,
What kind of facilities would be vague and loose, what kind of system, agreeing or opposing would only lead to disputes,
Wasting time, wasting manpower, and there would be no way to bring everyone together to realize democracy,
Wouldn't that allow domestic and foreign enemies to exploit the loopholes?
After decades of testing, it is known that
Marx's philosophy can always be universal; it is clear that Lenin's great talent and courage can
Develop the ideas of his predecessors; it shows the achievements of Stalin, who ruled for many years,
His achievements are passed down in history - shortcomings are also difficult to avoid, merits and demerits are judged by later generations.
To this day, this Tsarist Russia forty years ago - this Soviet Union of forty years, stands tall at the top of the world,
Not through arrogance, self-aggrandizement, or self-praise and false propaganda!
Life and facts, culture and progress, cannot deceive the world's discerning eyes, facts and evidence are before our eyes.
The Red Star hangs ten thousand feet high in the sky,
The true era of the people is at hand!
The broad road is bright and clear,
All nations look forward to joy!
Forty years... less than half a century, barely a person's middle age. It is difficult to calculate the great achievements, the joys and sorrows within are vastly different.
However, the achievements are so great, the impact on humanity is boundless.
Forty years... even the relationship with China would require a large book to fully describe.
The assistance in people and materials has always been for many years, I cannot write it all in this short poem.

        Let me sing again:
      The Red Star hangs ten thousand feet high in the sky,
      The true era of the people is at hand!
      The broad road is bright and clear,
      All nations look forward to joy!

### 四十年前与四十年后

    四十年前与四十年后
    王统照
    （在极度的气管支炎和关节炎的病中，手颤气促，勉成此诗，还是一气呵成。写后卧床半日，然心思畅朗，精神却好。附记。）不及半个世纪、才数到人的中年，经历过多少奋斗和苦难，从坚冰毒火上受过熬煎！风吹不倒，雷震不坏，多少逆流暗潮吞没不了
  这屹立如山——这屹立如山的红星高高
  竖立在世界北方的平原，高山、大河、森林、田野、乡村
  与城市都一齐红光闪闪。向内中集合，向外方扩展，
  向无尽的未来传留，绵延，把人类的最高理想，最伟大的
  现实，最公平的人生要在冰雪饥寒的地上实现。
  肃内、攘外，更和食粮，生产，作种种斗争，拚上了血肉，勇往
  直前。这一道血痕长途，后来者
  能不睁眼？这艰险、苦痛、……
  岂同泛泛！这里有铁的纪律，火的热情，明镜般的分析，
  移山填海的意志。不往回头看；不低头于困难，更不怕一时的
  天灾、人患。为人类、为真理、为公平理想的实现，——为打开
  社会主义的大门在先，然后才能走进共产主义的乐园！四十年来，有历史，有纪录，有血迹，
  汗点，
  更有多少奇伟的成绩般般。你可以比数、较量、寻思，这四十年
  的成果与以前的苦难！从一个落后、文盲、专制、腐朽的帝俄，
  潜变、突转，从黑暗里把红光四散。经多少种种奋争，才能够
  把工业、农业领导上新的阵线；才能使教育、科学、文化都写出了
  崭新的诗篇。群众生活的丰裕，边远地方的开拓，各行各业的进展，
  不须提，更不须一一表演，世界人有共闻共见，真成就岂靠
  宣传，生产进步有数目字的比观。四十年！现今更射出了洲际导弹，
  人造地球卫星也在天空现，佐证在前，就这点科学伟力，
  你能不平心赞叹！你能不想一想苏联的四十年前？导弹和卫星
  都是人类的“命星”飞耀在苍空无限。不是社会主义的制度能成就这般？
  不是共产党的组织、领导，又那有这四十年来的苏联！说有金钱，有人力，
  这不够数，没有好的政权，人与物都是散沙、断线。“单丝不成线”，“用
  钱向空填”，
  科学、文化都紧随着政权变迁。我，二十岁初知道“劳农政府”和“广
  义派”的字眼，当时，只认作满透新鲜，后来，从书志上多少知道一点，“布尔
  什维克”的含义何在，新政权的目的
  何在，可不能一览了然。……于今、四十年了，一切的良效皆实现；一切的政能到处传，
  若无精思，深想，为人类的崇高目的；无党的领导，主义的贯彻，任乱成一片，
  什么样的设施，模糊又松散，什么样的制度，赞同反对徒争喧，
  把时间空抛，人力白费，更没法叫大家集中起来把民主现，
  岂不叫国内外的敌人早把空子钻？经过几十年时间考验，才知道
  马克思的哲理永远能普遍；才明著列宁的雄才、魄力，能够
  把前人的思想发展；才显出执政若干年的斯大林
  他的成就所在，历史流传，——有缺点也难避免，功过但凭后人见。到今日
  这四十年前的帝俄——这四十年的
  苏联，巍巍高踞世界颠，并不是骄傲、自大、自吹自捧作虚传！
  生活和事实，文化和前进，遮不了世界人的明眼，事实、明证在眼前。
  红星万丈悬天半，
  真正的人民世纪在目前！
  宽阔大道光明显，
  各个民族企望都欣欢！四十年……不及半个世纪，才数到人的中年。丰功伟业难计算，此中苦乐太殊悬。可是，成绩巨大有这般，给人类的影响无边岸。四十年……即对中国的关系，也得一本大书方能叙述完。人与物的援助从来多少年，我没法写入这短短诗篇。
        且让我再歌一遍：
      红星万丈悬天半，
      真正的人民世纪在目前！
      宽阔大道光明显，
      各个民族企望都欣欢！
