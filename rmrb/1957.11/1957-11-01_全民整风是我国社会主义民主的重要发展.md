    The rectification movement and the anti-Rightist struggle of the past six months are a socialist revolutionary movement in the political and ideological spheres during the transition period in our country, and also a nationwide socialist democratic movement. This movement started among staff members and intellectuals in political circles, cultural and scientific circles, and has gradually expanded to workers, farmers, industrialists and businessmen, primary and secondary school teachers, and the military, and has already acquired a nationwide character and scale. The problem to be solved by this movement is the contradiction between two different natures in the transition period in our country, namely the contradiction between the enemy and ourselves and the contradiction among the people. The methods adopted to resolve these contradictions are the current popularized methods of great airing, great contending, big-character posters, symposiums, debates, and reports and articles in almost all newspapers and periodicals. This is a new form of socialist democracy suitable for the content of the current socialist revolution in the political and ideological fields.
    Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out in his "Report on the Rectification Movement": "Implementing the great airing, great contending, presenting facts, reasoning, issuing big-character posters, holding symposiums and debates, this is the most extensive socialist democracy, which bourgeois democracy cannot dream of. This is the method for correctly handling contradictions among the people, and also the method for educating and uniting the masses to fight against the enemy."
    Socialist democracy is fundamentally opposed to bourgeois democracy. We oppose bourgeois democracy because it is a means for a very few exploiters to oppress and deceive the vast majority of working people, and it serves the economic foundation of the capitalist private ownership system. The socialist democracy we practice is to protect the interests of the vast majority of working people, and to ensure that they can use their own strength to build a new life, to eliminate exploitation, to eliminate private ownership of the means of production, and to serve the economic foundation of the socialist public ownership system. Precisely because our socialist democracy is the democracy of the vast majority of the people, this determines that the content and form of our democracy must be widely adapted to the requirements of the vast majority of the people, and constantly enriched and developed. Socialist democracy will take various forms in different countries, at different times, and under different conditions. Now, the people of our country have created new forms of socialist democracy such as great airing, great contending, and big-character posters in the nationwide rectification movement. This is what our party must fully value and fully utilize.
    Our adoption of this form to carry out the rectification movement of the party, state organs and the whole people is a major new development in our party's democratic working methods. In 1942, our party carried out a rectification movement that played a significant role in the history of our party. This was a movement in which all party members, under the unified leadership of the party, promoted democracy and conducted systematic criticism and self-criticism to achieve the purpose of correcting mistakes and improving ideological level. During this rectification movement, methods such as big-character posters and symposiums had already appeared. Later, before and after the national liberation, there were three more such rectification and party consolidation movements. During the Three-Anti and Five-Anti campaigns, various methods of reasoning and struggle emerged to meet the needs of the time. We have universally adopted various mass criticism and self-criticism methods in factories, rural areas, schools, and the military. These democratic traditions, after the development of this recent period, have become the new forms of socialist democracy, such as the current great airing, great contending, etc., which are quite complete. Now that we have found this form of socialist democracy, many things will be easier to handle in the future. Whether it is a revolutionary issue or a construction issue, whether it is a major issue of right and wrong or a minor issue of right and wrong, it can be quickly resolved through great airing, great contending, and great debate. Big-character posters in various agencies, schools, and enterprises can gradually become a regular weapon for conducting such airing and debates.
    People should see that often many problems are almost never resolved in the absence of airing, contending, and debate; in the case of small airing, small contending, and small debate, some incomplete solutions are obtained very slowly; and in the case of great airing, great contending, and great debate, comprehensive and thorough solutions will be obtained quickly. From this, it can be seen that the method of great airing, great contending, and great debate should become an important method of socialist democracy. Although some issues may not be studied in great detail during great airing, great contending, and great debate, these can be supplemented by other methods, but the advantages of great airing, great contending, and great debate cannot be replaced by other methods. Because it is a mass action, it exposes problems more thoroughly, the criticism is more profound, the educational effect is greater, and the solutions to problems are more appropriate and rapid due to the collective wisdom of the majority.
    Some people are afraid of great airing, great contending, and great debate, and afraid of big-character posters. What are they afraid of? First, they are afraid of "chaos," and second, they are afraid of "being unable to step down." Their fear shows that they dare not firmly trust the majority of the masses. Firmly trusting the majority of the masses is the fundamental starting point for adopting the method of nationwide rectification and the method of great airing, great contending, and great debate, and it is also the fundamental starting point of Marxism-Leninism. Marxism-Leninism has always held that the people are the creators of history, and the people must, can only, and will certainly be able to save themselves. Lenin said in his "Report on the Work of the Council of People's Commissars" in January 1918: "The victory of the Soviet regime was achieved because the Soviet regime, from the very beginning, implemented the long-standing precepts of socialism, it thoroughly and resolutely relied on the masses, and it considered its task to be to awaken the most oppressed and most devastated strata of society to participate in vigorous life, and to promote them to participate in socialist creation." What we have done in the anti-Rightist struggle and the rectification movement is exactly this. What we rely on is mainly the most oppressed and most devastated strata in the old society, namely workers, poor peasants and lower-middle peasants. They are the main force of the revolution, and they, together with other people who support socialism, account for about 90% of our country's population. The remaining about 10% are not all firmly opposed to socialism. Those who are like that are only one or two percent, and they are isolated and scattered in the encirclement of the masses. Since our cause has the support of the vast majority of the masses, as long as we rely on the masses, the revolutionary world will not be chaotic, and we have no reason to be afraid of chaos. All great airing, great contending, great debate, and big-character posters, in the final analysis, can only benefit the proletariat and the people, and will not benefit the enemies of the proletariat and the people. The Rightists are justified in fearing the masses and distrusting the masses. There is no reason for the Leftists to fear the masses and distrust the masses. True Leftists must firmly trust the masses and rely on the masses, otherwise they are not true Leftists. The Rightists say that the Communist Party is no good and that socialism is no good. We say, well, let the masses listen to them, and then the masses will make a correct judgment. If the Rightists are not allowed to air their views freely and thoroughly expose themselves, how can the masses recognize those enemies and how can they rise up to wage a resolute and merciless struggle against those enemies? When the Rightists are airing their views freely, the revolutionary world seems to be somewhat chaotic, but once the masses recognize these enemies and attack them, the revolutionary world will not only not be chaotic, but will be a hundred times more consolidated than before. On the contrary, if the Rightists are not exposed and keep their words in their hearts, the masses do not understand them and do not know to fight against them, let alone how to fight against them, then they may confuse the masses and they may take advantage of some opportunity to make trouble. This is true for the Rightists, and it is also true for the mistakes and shortcomings in our work. Resolutely let go, boldly let go, thoroughly let go, and then resolutely change, boldly change, thoroughly change, and the result will definitely not be chaotic. Resolutely not allowing to let go, resolutely refusing to change, and the result, even if there is no great chaos, cannot avoid small chaos. This truth has been fully proven in our practice. The masses are reasonable and can distinguish right from wrong. Since the world will not be in great chaos, there is of course no problem of "being unable to step down." In fact, the people who really cannot step down are the Rightists themselves who hope that the Communist Party cannot step down, if they are not willing to bow their heads and confess their crimes and start anew. As long as they are good people, although they have made mistakes but are willing to correct them, the masses are willing to be kind to others.
    There are also some people who believe that the method of great airing, great contending, and great debate does not conform to the spirit of gentle breeze and fine rain in the rectification campaign. However, people all know that we advocate gentle breeze and fine rain, but at the beginning of the rectification movement, the Rightists attacked us with the force of a storm, and then the masses rose up and launched a counterattack against the Rightists, which of course could not but be a storm. However, this movement will eventually turn into gentle breeze and fine rain. When dealing with contradictions among the people, we must use gentle breeze and fine rain so that we can study and handle various issues very carefully and correctly. It should be pointed out that this kind of research and handling is still inseparable from the mass line, that is to say, it still has to go through the process of great airing, great contending, and great debate by the masses.
    At present, the people of the whole country are launching great airing, great contending, and great debate on the issue of two roads, that is, whether we should take the socialist road or the capitalist road, which is completely necessary. We should further launch a heated debate on this issue so that everyone can thoroughly understand the good and bad and right and wrong of these two roads. Regarding the issues of bureaucracy, sectarianism, and subjectivism, we should also mobilize the masses, air their views freely, put up big-character posters, hold symposiums, clarify right and wrong, find out the causes and methods of correction, and supervise the implementation of these methods. There are many unreasonable aspects in some of the work systems and management systems stipulated by party organizations, government agencies, people's organizations, schools, enterprises, and troops at all levels. Especially when focusing on rectification at present, these issues should be sorted out and resolved through great airing, great contending, and great debate. Regarding the issue of how to reasonably adjust the wages, benefits, and income distribution of the masses, and regarding the issue of how to overcome the tendencies of liberalism, individualism, absolute egalitarianism, departmentalism, and localism in the ideological consciousness of the masses, we should also gradually seek solutions through great airing, great contending, and great debate. In short, as long as we resolutely trust the masses and hand over the major issues that are closely related to the masses to the masses to discuss and debate under leadership, the current nationwide rectification movement will surely reap extremely rich results.

### 全民整风是我国社会主义民主的重要发展

    全民整风是我国社会主义民主的重要发展
    近半年来的整风运动和反右派斗争，是我国过渡时期在政治上和思想上的社会主义革命运动，也是一个全民性的社会主义民主运动。这个运动从政治界、文化科学界的工作人员和知识分子中开始，逐步扩大到工人、农民、工商业者、中小学教职员和军队中间，已经具有全民的性质和全民的规模了。这个运动所要解决的问题是我国过渡时期的两种不同性质的矛盾，即敌我矛盾和人民内部的矛盾。解决这些矛盾所采取的方式，是大鸣大放、大辩论、出大字报、开座谈会、开辩论会和在几乎一切报纸刊物上作报道、写文章等目前已经普及的方式。这是适合于目前政治上和思想上的社会主义革命内容的一种社会主义民主的新形式。
    邓小平同志在“关于整风运动的报告”中指出：“实行大鸣大放大争，摆事实，讲道理，出大字报，开座谈会和辩论会，这是最广泛的社会主义民主，是资产阶级民主所不能梦想的。这是正确处理人民内部矛盾的方法，也是教育和团结群众对敌人进行斗争的方法。”
    社会主义的民主同资产阶级的民主根本对立。我们反对资产阶级民主，因为它是极少数剥削者对于最大多数劳动人民实行压迫和欺骗的手段，是为资本主义私有制度的经济基础服务的。我们实行的社会主义民主，是为了保障最大多数劳动人民的利益，并且保障他们能用自己的力量来建设新生活，是为了消灭剥削，消灭生产资料的私有制，而为社会主义的公有制度的经济基础服务的。正因为我们的社会主义民主是最大多数人民的民主，这就决定了我们的民主内容和它的形式要广泛地适应于最大多数人民的要求，而不断地充实起来和发展起来。社会主义民主在各个国家、各个时期、各种不同的条件下，形式会是多种多样的。现在我国人民在全民整风运动中，创造了大鸣大放、大辩论、出大字报等社会主义民主的新形式，这是我们党所必须充分重视和充分运用的。
  我们采用这种形式进行党的、国家机关的和全民的整风运动，是我们党的民主工作方法的一个重大的新发展。1942年，我们党进行了在我们党的历史上起了重大作用的整风运动，这是全体党员在党的统一领导下，发扬民主，进行系统的批评和自我批评来达到纠正错误和提高思想水平的目的的运动。在这一次整风运动期间，大字报、座谈会等方式已经出现。后来，在全国解放以前和以后，又曾三次进行过这样的整风和整党运动。在三反五反期间，适应当时的需要，又有说理斗争的各种方式出现。我们在工厂、农村、学校、军队中都曾普遍采取各种群众性的批评和自我批评的方式。这些民主传统经过最近这个时期的发展，就成为现在的大鸣大放大争等相当完整的新的社会主义民主的形式了。我们找到了社会主义民主的这种形式，今后许多事情就好办了。无论革命问题或者建设问题，无论大是大非或者小是小非，都可以经过大鸣大放大辩论，而迅速地得到解决。各机关、各学校、各企业的大字报，都可以逐步地变为进行这种鸣放和争辩的一种经常性的武器。
    人们应该看到，往往有许多问题在不鸣不放不争的情况下，几乎老是得不到解决；在小鸣小放小争的情况下，很慢地得到了某些不彻底的解决；而在大鸣大放大争的情况下，就会很快地得到全面的彻底的解决。由此可见，大鸣大放大争的方法，应该成为社会主义民主的重要方法。虽然在大鸣大放大争的时候，有些问题不一定都能够进行非常详尽的研究，但是这些可以用其他方法来补足，而大鸣大放大争的优点，却不能用其他方法来代替。因为它是群众性的行动，揭露问题比较彻底，批评比较深刻，教育作用比较大，解决问题的办法由于多数人的集思广益也比较妥善而迅速。
    有些人害怕大鸣大放大辩论，害怕大字报。怕什么呢？一怕“乱”，二怕“下不了台”。他们的这种害怕，表示了他们不敢坚定地信任群众的多数。坚定地信任群众的多数，这是采用全民整风的方法、采用大鸣大放大辩论的方法的根本出发点，这也是马克思列宁主义的根本出发点。马克思列宁主义从来认为人民群众是历史的创造者，人民群众必须、也只能、也一定能自己救自己。列宁在1918年1月所作的“人民委员会的工作报告”中说：“苏维埃政权的胜利之所以取得，是因为苏维埃政权从最初起就实行社会主义的历来的训条，它彻底地坚决地依靠着群众，它认为它的任务，是在唤起社会上最受压迫的最受摧残的阶层起来参加活泼的生活，是提携他们起来参加社会主义的创造。”我们在反右派斗争和整风运动中所作的，就正是这样。我们所依靠的，主要的就是在旧社会最受压迫最受摧残的阶层，就是工人、贫农和下中农。他们是革命的主力，他们加上其他拥护社会主义的人在一起，就占我国人口的90％左右。其余约10％的人，也并不都是坚决反对社会主义的，那样的人不过百分之一、二，而他们是孤立地分散在群众的包围之中的。我们的事业既然有群众的绝大多数的支持，只要我们依靠群众，革命的天下就不会乱，我们就没有怕乱的理由。一切大鸣大放，大争大辩，大字报，归根结底，只能有利于无产阶级和人民群众，而不会有利于无产阶级和人民群众的敌人。右派害怕群众、不信任群众是有理由的，左派害怕群众、不信任群众是没有理由的。真正的左派必然坚定地信任群众，依靠群众，否则他就不是真正的左派。右派说共产党不行，说社会主义不行。我们说，好吧，让群众听一听他们的吧，然后群众就会作出正确的判决。如果不让右派大鸣大放，彻底地暴露他们自己，群众怎么会认清那些敌人，怎么会起来同那些敌人作坚决无情的斗争呢？当右派大鸣大放的时候，革命的天下似乎有一些乱，但是群众一旦认清了这些敌人并且向他们进攻，革命的天下就不但不乱，而且比以前巩固了一百倍。相反，如果右派分子不暴露，有话都藏在心里，群众不了解他们，不知道要同他们斗争，更不知道要怎样同他们斗争，那么，他们就有可能迷惑群众，他们就有可能利用某种时机起来捣乱。对于右派是如此，对于我们工作中的错误和缺点也是如此。坚决地放，大胆地放，彻底地放，随之而坚决地改，大胆地改，彻底地改，其结果天下必不乱。坚决地不许放，坚决地不肯改，其结果天下即令不大乱，也不能免于小乱。这个真理，在我们的实践中已经充分证明了。群众是讲道理的，是能够分清是非的。天下既然不会大乱，当然也就没有什么“下不了台”的问题。事实上，真正下不了台的人，就是那些希望共产党下不了台的右派分子自己，如果他们不肯低头认罪，从新作人的话。只要是好人，虽然犯了错误但是愿意改正，那么，群众是愿意与人为善的。
    还有一些人认为，大鸣大放大争的方法，不符合和风细雨的整风精神。但是，人们都知道，我们是主张和风细雨的，而整风运动一开始，右派分子却以狂风暴雨之势向我们进攻，接着群众起来了，向右派举行了反击，这当然不能不也是一场大风大雨。不过，这个运动终究还是要转为和风细雨的。在对待人民内部矛盾的时候，一定要用和风细雨，这样才能十分细致而正确地研究和处理各种问题。应该指出的是，这种研究和处理，仍然离不开群众路线，就是说，仍然是要通过群众的大鸣大放大争的过程。
    目前全国人民正在就两条道路的问题，就是说，究竟应该走社会主义的道路还是应该走资本主义道路的问题，展开大鸣大放大争，这是完全必要的。应该进一步对这个问题展开热烈的大辩论，使人人都彻底地弄清楚这两条道路的好坏和是非。对于官僚主义、宗派主义、主观主义的问题，也应该发动群众，大鸣大放，贴大字报，开座谈会，弄清是非，找出原因和纠正的办法，并且监督这些办法的实行。各级党组织、政府机关、人民团体、学校、企业和部队所规定的某些工作制度和管理制度，有许多不够合理的地方，在目前着重进行整改的时候，尤其应该经过大鸣大放大争，对这些问题加以整理和解决。对于群众的工资福利和收入分配如何合理调整的问题，对于群众思想意识中的自由主义、个人主义、绝对平均主义、本位主义、地方主义等倾向如何克服的问题，同样也应该经过大鸣大放大争，逐步求得解决。总之，只要坚决地信任群众，把同群众有密切关系的重大问题有领导地交给群众去讨论和辩论，那么，当前的全民整风运动就一定能够得到极为丰富的收获。
