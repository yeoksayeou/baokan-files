Xinhua News Agency, 15th dispatch: Washington news: The U.S. State Department issued a statement on the 14th, stating that the U.S. government has decided to supply Tunisia with a batch of weapons.

The statement said that this shipment of arms is a "preliminary response" to President Bourguiba's appeal on September 4th for assistance in purchasing arms.

U.S. State Department spokesman White said in response to a question that the U.S. government's decision had been formally notified to France on the same day.

In addition, according to news from London, the British Foreign Office also announced on the evening of the 14th that Britain had decided to immediately ship a batch of weapons worth 20,000 pounds to Tunisia.

Xinhua News Agency, 15th dispatch: Paris news: The decision by the United States and Britain to provide weapons to Tunisia has plunged the fragile Gaillard government into a new predicament.

Reports say that French Prime Minister Gaillard met with the U.S. and British ambassadors to France at 2:00 a.m. on the 14th and lodged a "verbal protest" with them. The French ambassador to the United States also verbally conveyed the French government's protest when he met with Dulles on the same day.

Foreign Minister Pineau, when reporting to the National Assembly's Foreign Affairs Committee on this issue on the morning of the 14th, accused the U.S. and Britain of "undermining the unity of Atlantic nations" and said that the French government expressed "regret" over the "initiative" taken by the two countries. Pineau said that he would fly to Washington on the 15th to discuss the issue with Dulles.

Reports say that many members of the National Assembly have been angrily discussing France's withdrawal from the North Atlantic Treaty in the lounges these past two days.

France has signed an agreement with Tunisia and has already begun implementing it this summer. This agreement stipulates that France will supply weapons to equip the Tunisian army.

Xinhua News Agency, 15th dispatch: Paris news: The French delegation participating in the third annual meeting of the NATO Parliamentary Assembly announced today its withdrawal from the meeting to protest the United States and Britain's decision to ship weapons to Tunisia, disregarding France's opposition. The principle of strengthening the so-called "interdependence" of various countries in the North Atlantic bloc, which Western politicians have been advocating recently, has thus encountered a reef.

In a statement read at the parliamentary assembly, the French delegation denounced the decisions of the United States and Britain as "unjust" and declared that "the objective of this session, namely seeking the unity of the North Atlantic countries, no longer has any meaning," and therefore, the French delegation decided "to no longer participate in the work of this session." The statement also requested that the next meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council discuss "this rupture in Western solidarity."

After reading the statement, the French delegation walked out of the meeting.

A spokesman for the French delegation later explained that the French delegation's withdrawal from this session also meant withdrawal from the various standing committees of this session.

Today, various bourgeois newspapers in Paris also unanimously attacked the United States and Britain. "Le Parisien Libéré" threatened that the decisions of the United States and Britain might prompt France to "withdraw from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization."

    美英法在北非利害冲突表面化
    美英要向突尼斯供应军火想挖法国墙脚
    法退出北大西洋集团议员会议表示抗议
    新华社15日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务院14日发表声明说，美国政府已经决定供给突尼斯一批武器。
    声明说，这次运送的军火是对布尔吉巴总统9月4日提出的要求在购买军火方面给予援助的呼吁的一个“初步答复”。
    美国国务院发言人怀特在回答问题时说，美国政府的这个决定已经在当天正式通知法国。
    另外据来自伦敦的消息说，英国外交部也在14日晚间宣布，英国已经决定把一批价值二万英镑的武器立即运给突尼斯。
    新华社15日讯　巴黎消息：美英两国决定向突尼斯提供武器这件事把脆弱的盖伊阿政府投入了新的窘境。
    有消息说，法国总理盖伊阿在14日清晨两点钟接见了美英两国驻法大使，并且向他们提出“口头抗议”。法国驻美大使在同一天会见杜勒斯时也在口头转达了法国政府的抗议。
    外交部长比诺14日上午向国民议会外交委员会就这个问题作报告时，指责美英两国这种作法是“破坏大西洋国家的团结”，并且说法国政府对这两国所采取的这种“主动”表示“遗憾”。比诺说，他将在15日飞往华盛顿同杜勒斯讨论这个问题。
    有消息说，国民议会不少议员这两天在休息室里气愤地讨论着法国退出北大西洋公约的问题。
    法国同突尼斯签订过一项协定，并且已经在今年夏天开始执行这项协定。这项协定规定由法国供给武器装备突尼斯军队。
    新华社15日讯　巴黎消息：参加北大西洋集团议员会议第三届年会的法国代表团今天宣布退出这个会议，以表示抗议美国和英国不顾法国的反对，决定运送武器给突尼斯。西方政客们最近以来鼓吹的要加强所谓北大西洋集团各国“互相依赖”的原则，就这样遇到了一个礁石。
    法国代表团在议员会议上宣读的声明中指斥美国和英国的决定是“不公正的”，并且宣告，“本届会议的目标，即寻求北大西洋国家的团结，已经没有什么意义”，因此，法国代表团决定“不再参加这次会议的工作”。声明还要求北大西洋集团理事会下次会议讨论“西方团结中的这次破裂”。
    在宣读声明以后，法国代表团就走出了会场。
    法国代表团发言人事后又解释说，法国代表团退出本届会议同时也就是退出本届会议的各个常设委员会。
    今天巴黎的各种资产阶级报纸也一致攻击美国和英国。“解放了的巴黎人报”威胁说，美国和英国的决定可能要促使法国“退出北大西洋公约联盟”。
