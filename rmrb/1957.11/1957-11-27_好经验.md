    Good Experience		Wang Pu
    The Shanghai Ballpoint Pen Factory No. 1's method of educating workers on the correct relationship between individual and national interests by revealing all the facts, keeping meticulous accounts, and arranging site visits has truly grasped the key to reasonably resolving employee welfare issues.
    The working class is the most selfless, the most capable of subordinating individual and local interests to overall interests, and the most capable of subordinating temporary interests to long-term interests. However, this does not mean that there will be no one among the workers who raises demands that contradict overall and long-term interests. During the rectification campaign, almost every enterprise had some people who raised overly high demands regarding living welfare that were unreasonable or could not be resolved temporarily. This is not surprising. This is because the workers' position has limitations; they do not understand the overall situation of the enterprise and the country, and they naturally tend to pay more attention to current, local, and individual interests. Especially young workers, because they have not experienced the suffering of the old society, cannot appreciate the contrast between the lives of workers in old and new China, cannot deeply understand how the Chinese people went through arduous struggles to achieve liberation, and do not understand that building a beautiful socialist society requires long-term hard work. Therefore, they are also more likely to raise some unreasonable and overly high living demands. Therefore, the leader's responsibility is to use vivid facts to help workers understand the situation of the enterprise and the country, help them break free from local limitations, so that when they think about problems and make suggestions, they can stand higher, see farther, see not only their own needs, but also the needs of the people of the whole country, see not only their own difficulties, but also the difficulties of the enterprise and the country.
    The experience of the Shanghai Ballpoint Pen Factory No. 1 tells us that once the workers understand the overall situation and the difficulties of the country, they will automatically withdraw unreasonable or temporarily unsolvable demands, and will fully demonstrate the noble qualities of the working class, being selfless and proceeding from the overall interests in everything. Now, some leading comrades in enterprises, seeing that workers have raised some demands that are too high to be accepted, or discovering that some unreasonable living welfare systems need to be reformed, feel very embarrassed at this time, and dare not openly explain to the masses, nor dare to openly propose reforms. As for persuading the masses to willingly and sincerely withdraw these demands and support these reforms, it is even more unimaginable for them. This kind of thinking actually reflects their distrust of the masses and distrust of the workers' class consciousness. These comrades should dispel their concerns after reading the experience of the Shanghai Ballpoint Pen Factory No. 1, firmly believe in the majority of the masses, and hand over all issues involving the personal interests of employees to the masses for discussion, while telling the masses about the national situation of the enterprise and the country. For young workers, we must also organize old workers to educate them with their personal experiences in the old society. In this way, all problems will be smoothly resolved in accordance with the requirements of the state.

    好经验	王朴
    上海笔尖一厂用摊底牌、算大账、参观现场的办法来教育工人正确认识个人利益与国家利益的关系，真是抓住了合理解决职工福利问题的关键。
    工人阶级是最大公无私的，是最能以个人利益、局部利益服从整体利益，最能以暂时的利益服从长远利益的。但是，这并不是说，在工人中，就不会有人提出一些跟整体利益和长远利益相矛盾的要求来。在整风运动中，差不多每个企业都有一些人在生活福利方面，提出不太合理的或暂时不能解决的过高要求。这并没有什么奇怪。这是由于工人所处的地位有局限性，他们不了解企业和国家的全面情况，很自然地就比较容易注意当前的、局部的、个人的利益。尤其是年青工人，由于没有经历过旧社会的折磨，体会不到旧中国跟新中国工人生活的对比，不能深切了解我国人民曾经怎样经历千辛万苦的斗争才得到解放，不懂得建立一个美好的社会主义社会要经过长期的艰苦劳动，所以，他们也比较容易提出一些不合理的过高的生活要求。因之，领导者的责任，就是要用生动的事实来帮助工人了解企业的和全国的情况，帮助他们从局部的限制中摆脱出来，使他们想问题、提意见的时候，能站得高一些，看得远一些，不只看到自己的需要，还看到全国人民的需要，不只看到自己的困难，还看到企业的困难，国家的困难。
    上海笔尖一厂的经验告诉我们，工人一旦了解了全面的情况，了解了国家的困难，就会自动取消不合理的或者暂时解决不了的要求，就会充分表现出来大公无私，处处从整体利益出发的工人阶级的高贵品质。现在，有些企业的领导同志，看到工人提出一些过高的要求不能接受，或者发现有些不合理的生活福利制度需要改革，这时候，他们就感到十分为难，不敢向群众公开解释，也不敢公开提出改革。至于说服群众心悦诚服地自动撤消这些要求，赞成这些改革，对他们说来，更是不可想像的事。这种思想，实际上反映了他们不相信群众，不相信工人阶级的觉悟。这些同志看了上海笔尖一厂的经验应该破除顾虑，坚决相信群众的多数，把一切涉及职工个人利益的问题，放手交给群众讨论，同时把企业的国家的全国情况告诉群众。对于年青工人，还要组织老工人用在旧社会的亲身经历教育他们。这样，一切问题就都会顺利地按照国家的要求得到解决。
