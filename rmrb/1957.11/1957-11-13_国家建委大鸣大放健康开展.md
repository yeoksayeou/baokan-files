Xinhua News Agency, 12th: The walls of the State Construction Commission office building are covered with big-character posters. From the beginning of the third stage of rectification on October 30th to the 10th, a total of 1,462 big-character posters have been posted. On the 5th and 6th alone, 635 big-character posters were posted, reaching a peak. Currently, more than 200 big-character posters are still being posted every day. The number of people in the entire commission who wrote big-character posters reached 86% of those participating in the rectification. For example, the Transportation Bureau had only 39 cadres, but more than 130 big-character posters were produced.

According to the person in charge of the State Construction Commission Party Committee, the big-character posters have three characteristics. First, the opinions in the big-character posters are mainly focused on issues related to implementing guidelines and policies, streamlining organizations, and improving business operations. An analysis of the 970 opinions expressed before the 6th of this month showed that these opinions accounted for more than half. In these big-character posters, some people suggested that some institutions could be merged, and administrative personnel and secretarial groups could be reduced. Some people criticized the State Construction Commission's leadership for not adequately implementing the principle of building the country through diligence and frugality, such as inaccurate budget quotas, which resulted in waste; the indirect costs were too high, which amounted to taking care of backwardness. Some people criticized the State Construction Commission for not focusing well on the key points of design review, one of its main tasks. Second, the big-character posters not only contained criticism but also suggestions, debates, and replies. The Heavy Industry Bureau, Fuel Bureau, Machinery Bureau, and Light Industry Bureau of the State Construction Commission all had people responsible for reviewing civil engineering designs. This time, someone criticized this practice in a big-character poster, saying that it was a go-it-alone approach that wasted manpower and affected work quality. This big-character poster also suggested that the personnel reviewing civil engineering should be merged and centralized, with a division of labor for review, which could improve the quality of work and reduce personnel. An official from the General Office raised the opinion that "promotion is a sign of a person's progress," which immediately caused a debate, and many big-character posters were posted in response to this opinion. An official from the General Office criticized the Metallurgical Division of the Heavy Industry Bureau in a big-character poster for delaying a document for more than twenty days, despite repeated reminders to forward it. The next day, the personnel involved posted a big-character poster to make a self-criticism and quickly processed the document. Someone criticized the cadres of the Labor and Wage Bureau in a big-character poster for lax labor discipline, and the cadres of the Labor and Wage Bureau immediately posted a big-character poster expressing acceptance and gratitude. Third, seeking truth from facts and being calm and peaceful. During the first stage of blooming and contending, radical emotions were quite prevalent among the masses. Some big-character posters were full of abuse and attacks. Some people seized on some unsubstantiated and hearsay matters to write big-character posters. However, this time the great blooming and great contending is different. Many people conducted investigations to offer opinions, verifying materials repeatedly until they clarified the facts before posting big-character posters. This time, attention was also paid to grasping the proper tone and language in the wording of the big-character posters, striving to conform to the actual situation. In the first great blooming and great contending, big-character posters were rarely signed, while this time almost all of them were signed.

The person in charge of the State Construction Commission Party Committee said: The healthy development of this great blooming and great contending is the result of the increased awareness, correct stance, and attitude of all the staff of the State Construction Commission after the anti-Rightist struggle.

### 国家建委大鸣大放健康开展

    国家建委大鸣大放健康开展
    大字报的三个特点：
    一、主要集中在改进工作上面；二、有批评，有建议，有争论，有答复；三、实事求是，心平气和。
    新华社12日讯　国家建设委员会办公大楼内的各处墙壁都已被大字报贴满。从上月30日开始转入整风第三阶段到10日为止，大字报一共贴出了一千四百六十二张。其中5、6两日贴出的大字报就有六百三十五张，达到高峰。现在每天贴出的大字报仍在二百张以上。全委写大字报的人数达到参加整风人数的86％，其中如交通局只有三十九个干部，就出了大字报一百三十多张。
    据建委党委会负责人谈，这次的大字报有三个特点。第一，大字报的意见主要集中在有关贯彻方针政策、紧缩机构和改进业务工作的问题上面，对本月6日以前九百七十条意见的分析，属于这些意见的占到半数以上。在这次的大字报上有人提出有些机构可以合并，行政人员和秘书组可以减少，有人批评建委领导上贯彻勤俭建国方针不够，如预算定额有的不准换算，造成浪费；间接费太高，等于照顾了落后。有人批评建委对主要工作之一的审核设计工作没有很好抓住重点。第二，这次大字报不只有批评还有建议，有争论，也有答复。建委重工业局、燃料局、机械局、轻工业局都有人负责审核土建设计。这次有人在大字报上批评这是单干作法，既浪费人力又影响工作质量。这张大字报同时建议把审核土建的人员合并集中起来，分工审核，既可以提高工作质量，也可以减少人员。办公厅一个干部提出“提级是标志一个人进步”的意见，马上就引起争论，对这个意见出了许多张大字报。办公厅一个干部在大字报上批评重工业局冶金处把一件公文拖了二十几天，几次催促都不转去。第二天有关的人员就贴出大字报作检讨，并迅速把这件公文处理了。有人在大字报上批评劳动工资局干部，劳动纪律松懈，劳动工资局的干部立即贴出大字报表示接受和感谢。第三，实事求是，心平气和。在第一阶段鸣放时，群众中偏激情绪相当普遍。一些大字报充满了谩骂和攻击。有些人抓住一些捕风捉影和道听途说的事情就写大字报。但是，这一次的大鸣大放却不同。许多人为了要提意见，进行调查，三番五次对证材料，直到把事实弄清楚以后才出大字报。这一次的大字报在行文用语方面也注意掌握分寸，力求符合于实际情况，在第一次大鸣大放时，大字报很少署名，而这次则几乎全部都署了名。
    建委党委负责人说：这一次的大鸣大放能够这样健康地展开，是建委全体工作人员经过反右派斗争后觉悟提高，端正了立场和态度的结果。
