    美机不断侵犯领空  朝中方面提出抗议
    新华社平壤4日电据朝鲜中央通讯社开城消息：朝鲜军事停战委员会双方秘书长会议今天在开城举行。朝中方面秘书长在会上抗议美方飞机违反停战协定不断侵入朝中方面上空，同时要求美方根据停战协定采取相应的措施。
    朝中方面秘书长在会上指出，在8月15日到11月1日之间，发生了十七起美方飞机违反停战协定侵入朝中方面上空的事件，其中有一起是美方飞机公然侵入军事停战委员会朝中方面代表团驻在地开城的上空。
    朝中方面秘书长又指出，虽然朝中方面已经多次要求美方注意美方人员违反停战协定不佩戴任何识别标志进入非军事区这个事实，这种事件还是继续发生。仅在8月1日到10月20日这一期间就发生这类的美方违反军事协定事件二十三起。
    朝中方面秘书长在今天的会议上要求美方严格管理它的人员，以防止再发生上述违反停战协定的事件。
