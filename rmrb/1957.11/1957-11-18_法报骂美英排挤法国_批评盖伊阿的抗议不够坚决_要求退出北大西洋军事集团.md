Xinhua News Agency, November 17th: Paris dispatch: French newspapers on the 16th continued to comment with indignation on the United States and Britain's decision to supply weapons to Tunisia. The statement by the spokesperson of the U.S. Embassy in Tunisia that U.S. weapons would be continuously transported to Tunisia further fueled the already tense atmosphere. The mood in Paris was so agitated that the authorities had to increase the number of motorcycle police equipped with radio communication devices to about fifty in front of the U.S. and British embassies in Paris to guard them.

    "Zhendan Bao" wrote in its commentary on the U.S. and British decision: The "tricks" adopted by the U.S. and Britain "can obviously be explained by oil... The problem lies in squeezing us out." The newspaper believes that France can no longer rely on so-called "Atlantic solidarity" and that "from now on, it should only rely on itself."

    Many newspapers criticized Prime Minister Gaillard's speech in the National Assembly, believing that his protest was not firm enough. "Liberated Parisian Daily" believes that the protest was "illusory." "Echo Newspaper" pointed out, "Verbal protests cannot change the status quo at all. After the launching of artificial satellites, this new blow should awaken the French and force the representatives of the parliament to change their policies and methods in all aspects."

    "Liberation Daily" pointed out that the fact that Britain and the United States transported weapons to Tunisia proves that the French government's policy has led the country into a "humiliating dead end." The necessary conditions for getting out of this dead end are to stop the Algerian war, withdraw from the Atlantic Alliance, and implement an independent foreign policy.

### 法报骂美英排挤法国  批评盖伊阿的抗议不够坚决  要求退出北大西洋军事集团

    法报骂美英排挤法国
    批评盖伊阿的抗议不够坚决
    要求退出北大西洋军事集团
    据新华社17日讯　巴黎消息：法国报刊16日继续愤慨地评论美国和英国把武器供给突尼斯的决定。美国驻突尼斯大使馆发言人关于美国武器将源源运到突尼斯去的声明对于本来就已经紧张了的气氛更是火上加油。巴黎的情绪如此激动，当局不得不在美、英两国驻巴黎大使馆前面各增派大约五十名配备有无线电通讯设备的摩托警察，加以守护。
    “震旦报”在评论美英两国的决定时写道：美英所采取的“这些手腕显然可以用石油来做解释……问题是在于排挤我们。”这家报纸认为法国已经不能依靠所谓“大西洋团结”，而“从现在起，它应该只依靠自己了”。
    许多报纸批评了总理盖伊阿在国民议会上的演说，认为他所提的抗议是不够坚决的。“解放了的巴黎人报”认为，这个抗议是“虚幻的”。“回声报”指出，“口头上的抗议丝毫不能改变现状。在人造卫星发射之后，这个新的打击应该唤醒法国人，迫使议会的代表们改变他们在各方面的政策和方法。”
    “解放报”指出，英美把武器运往突尼斯这件事就证明了法国政府的政策已经把国家引进“屈辱的死胡同”，从这个死胡同中走出来的必要条件是停止阿尔及利亚战争、退出大西洋联盟并且执行独立的外交政策。
