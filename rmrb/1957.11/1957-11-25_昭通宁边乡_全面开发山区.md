Zhaotong Ningbian Township

Comprehensively Developing Mountainous Areas

(Report from our newspaper) Ningbian Township, Zhaotong County, Yunnan Province, is earnestly implementing the spirit of the National Agricultural Development Program, comprehensively developing mountainous area production, and has surpassed the production and living standards of local well-to-do middle peasants in just one year. After the comprehensive collectivization of Ningbian Township last spring, they earnestly discussed the forty articles of the National Agricultural Development Program and, based on the characteristics of mountainous areas being suitable for diversified operations, formulated a plan for the comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline production, adapting to local conditions. They first focused on grain production, adopting measures to develop high-yield crops and improve farming techniques. In 1956, the township planted more than 3,000 mu of potatoes, yielding over 3.75 million jin, equivalent to 121% of the township's total grain output in 1955. Not only did the yield per mu increase, but the planting area also expanded compared to 1955. While developing grain production, Ningbian Township also developed animal husbandry. In 1956, the number of pigs tripled, and the number of goats, sheep, cattle, and horses increased by about 25%. In addition, they actively developed various sideline productions in the mountainous areas, greatly increasing the income of the commune members. Recently, they have conducted planning based on the forty articles of the National Agricultural Development Program.

    昭通宁边乡
    全面开发山区
    本报讯　云南昭通县宁边乡认真贯彻农业发展纲要精神，全面开发山区生产，仅仅一年内就超过了当地富裕中农的生产生活水平。去年春宁边乡全面合作化后，认真讨论了农业发展纲要四十年，并根据结合山区宜于多种经营的特点，因地制宜地制定了全面发展农、林、牧和副业生产的规划。他们首先抓住了粮食生产，采取发展高产作物和改进耕作技术的措施。1956年全乡种植洋芋三千多亩，收入三百七十五万多斤，相当于1955年全乡粮食总产量的121％。不仅单产提高了，种植面积也比1955年扩大了。宁边乡在发展粮食生产的同时，还发展了畜牧生产。1956年生猪增加三倍，山羊、绵羊、黄牛、马增加25％左右。此外，还积极的发展了山区的各种副业生产，使社员们大大地增加了收入。最近，他们又根据农业发展纲要四十条进行了规划。
