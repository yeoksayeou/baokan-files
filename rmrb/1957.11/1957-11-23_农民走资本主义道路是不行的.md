Listen, listen, the dogs are barking,
The beggars have come to town,
Some in sacks, some in rags,
And some in silken gowns.

When I was a child, my mother often sang this old rhyme to me. But it was not until I grew up that I understood why there was such a rhyme describing so many beggars. In fact, the beggars mentioned in the rhyme referred to peasants, retainers of feudal nobles, and monks. They were driven out during the enclosure movement in England and became beggars.

The transition from feudal agricultural society to bourgeois industrial society in England is a typical example. At present, some people in China advocate using capitalist methods to do things. Therefore, it is meaningful to study the experiences of the peasant class in England at that time.

Generally speaking, five hundred years ago, there were no capitalists in England. Most English people were what Marx described as "free peasant proprietors." They labored on their own land for themselves.

Capitalism cannot grow in such an environment. The growth of capitalism requires the free purchase of labor, requiring capitalists to find people without means of production who are thus "free" to sell their labor.

In England, the growth of capitalism was achieved in this way: the enclosure movement drove away the peasants, and landlords burned down the peasants' houses, forcing them to work for others and earn wages to survive.

The enclosure movement brought great suffering and poverty to the peasant class. The peasants had nowhere to turn for help because the landlords and factory owners controlled the law. There is an English song that goes:

The law demands that we atone
When we take things we do not own
But leaves the lords and ladies fine
Who take things that are yours and mine

When the feudal landlords enclosed land for pastures to increase wool production for the emerging textile industry, Catholic monasteries were abolished, and church property was confiscated and sold cheaply or given as gifts to the king's friends. The people in these places were also driven out.

As a result, an army of unemployed was formed. Years later, factories and businesses absorbed them and their children. However, the labor supply always exceeded demand.

Regardless of the reason for unemployment, the authorities enacted a series of terrible laws, forcing them to accept any job, regardless of the conditions or pay. "Stubborn vagrants" should have one ear cut off, repeat offenders should have another ear cut off, and a third offense would result in hanging. Beggars were given to those who reported them as slaves, chained up, and forced to work with whips. Even fourteen-year-olds who could not find work were tortured and branded. If arrested three times in a row, they would be executed.

Marx quoted the example of the notorious Duchess of Sutherland, who drove out all the residents of her clan's land in order to open a sheep farm. Marx wrote: "Between 1814 and 1820, about 15,000 people, comprising about 3,000 families, were systematically evicted and annihilated. Their villages were destroyed and burned; their fields were all turned into pastures. British soldiers clashed with the residents while carrying out orders. An old woman refused to leave her hut and was burned to death in the flames. In this way, the Duchess took possession of 794,000 acres of land that had belonged to the clan since time immemorial." (Das Kapital)

This is how emerging capitalism transformed the peasants' means of labor into capital and turned the peasants into a reserve of labor. This is the means of producing the proletariat necessary for the development of industrial capitalism.

With such a large army of unemployed without any organizational traditions, the wage standard could be lowered to the lowest limit. As a result, children had to work at a very young age.

They had no trade unions and had to work fifteen to sixteen hours a day. As late as 1816, nine workers in Stockport, England, were sentenced to two years in prison for attempting to organize a trade union.

In 1836, a writer wrote: "More than one million people are on the verge of starvation, and this number is constantly increasing." At that time, the total population of England was only a few million.

Here is the testimony of eleven-year-old Thomas Clark to those investigating child labor in factories. He said: "If we doze off, they whip us...The foreman (overseer) often has a double-stranded, knotted rope as thick as my thumb in his hand...I always go to the factory before six in the morning, sometimes at five o'clock, and work until nine in the evening...I earn about four shillings (about one yuan and three jiao in RMB) a week...Sometimes my brother takes my shift. He is only seven years old. I don't give him any pay...If he weren't my brother, I would have to give him one shilling every week."

Initially, these former peasants blindly resisted, launching riots and destroying machines, attempting to hinder the development of industry. This was a natural but ineffective resistance. Many years later, they realized that, whether they liked it or not, they had become workers, and they had to unite to defend their interests and fight for socialism.

Capitalism, with its blind and cruel methods, did increase production and develop industry—but much more slowly than the industrial development of socialist countries. The industrial development of capitalism made the people of England and the people of all colonies pay a very high price. Capitalism is promoted through prosperity, depression, massive unemployment, the poverty of the majority and the wealth of the minority, war, and disaster.

Strictly speaking, there is no peasant class in England now. English farms are capitalist farms. The workers on the farms are wage-earning, unionized workers. Most of them work on large, mechanized farms. The workers in England have now forgotten that they came from peasants. Their task is to overthrow the oldest and most experienced bourgeoisie in the world.

In China, the situation is different. Of course, as in England, under feudalism, there could be no improvement in the people's living conditions. Urban and rural exchanges must increase. The question is: how to realize the industrial and agricultural revolution in China—by capitalist methods or by socialist methods?

The capitalist method, as happened in England, is anarchic competition, everyone for himself, the backward suffer, progress is slow, and fluctuations occur. The happiness of the minority is built on the suffering of the majority, and there is also the threat of war. Under the current conditions, this method means for China to become a semi-colony of the United States, meaning the poverty of a large number of peasants and their being used as cheap labor to work in privately-run factories, and it also means the restoration of landlords in the countryside. Before liberation, there were many Chinese Thomas Clarks. If capitalism is completely restored, there will be millions of Thomas Clarks.

The socialist road is the road that China is taking under the slogan of "building modern industry and modern agriculture"—not to impoverish the peasant class, but to gradually develop the agricultural population of the working class. There is no enclosure movement here, no ranks of beggars, and no cutting off of ears or hanging for failing to find work. Development here is stable and planned. Everyone's life is improving day by day with economic development. There is no phenomenon of a minority enjoying happiness and the majority being poor. The urban and rural areas are not contradictory, but support each other. Where there are conflicts of interest, they are resolved through democratic discussion.

The contrast between the history of England and the history of China clearly shows that the socialist road is the most promising road for the peasants.

    农民走资本主义道路是不行的
    阿兰·魏宁顿
    听，听，狗在叫，
    乞丐来到了镇上，
    有的披麻袋，有的穿破袄，
    有的穿着绸袍。
    当我还是一个小孩子的时候，我的母亲时常对我唱这支古老的小调。但是，直到我长大成人，我才了解为什么会有这样一支小调来描写这么多的乞丐。实际上，这首小调所提到的乞丐指的是农民、封建大贵族家里的扈从和僧侣。他们在英国的圈地运动中，被赶了出来，流落成乞丐。
    英国从封建农业社会到资产阶级工业社会的过渡具有典型的形式。目前中国有些人主张用资本主义的方法来办事。因此，研究一下英国当时农民阶级的遭遇是件有意义的事情。
    一般来讲，在五百年前，英国还没有资本家，大多数的英国人是马克思所描写的“自由的自耕农民”。他们在自己的土地上为他们自己而劳动。
    资本主义是不能在这样的环境下生长的。资本主义的生长要求自由购买劳动力，要求资本家能够找到没有生产工具因而“自由”出卖自己劳动力的人。
    在英国，资本主义的生长是这样达成的：圈地运动赶走了农民，地主焚毁了农民的房屋，使他们不得不去为别人作工，赚取工资来维持生活。
    圈地运动给农民阶级带来了极大苦难和贫困。农民无处求援，因为地主和工厂主们掌握了法律。有这样一首英国歌曲：
    从公地上偷鹅的人，
    法律把他们关进监牢；
    但对窃取公地的恶棍，
    法律却不动他们一根毫毛。
    当封建地主为了新兴的纺织工业而圈地作牧场以增产羊毛的时候，天主教修道院遭受取缔，教会产业被没收并贱价出售或作为礼物分赠给国王的朋友们。这些地方的人也被赶了出来。
    结果，失业的大军形成了。几年后，工厂和商店企业吸收了他们和他们的孩子。不过，劳动力总是供过于求。
    不管失业者没有工作的理由是什么，当局制订了一系列可怕的法律，强迫他们不论条件如何，报酬多少，接受任何工作。“顽梗的流浪汉”应割去一只耳朵，重犯就割去另一只，第三次再犯就处绞刑，这就是法律。乞丐被送给告发他们的人当奴隶，用铁链把他们锁起来，用鞭子来强迫他们工作。甚至连十四岁的小孩找不到工作也要受到拷打并被打上烙印。如果连续被捕三次，就被处极刑。
    马克思曾引用过臭名昭彰的苏德兰女公爵的例子。这位女公爵为了开辟一个牧羊场，就把她的氏族的土地上所有居民统统赶掉。马克思写道：“由1814年至1820年间，大约包含有三千家族的一万五千人口，都被系统地驱逐了，剿灭了。他们的村落被破坏了，焚毁了；他们的田地全部转化为牧场了。英国的士兵在执行命令时，与居民发生冲突。一个老妇人拒绝离开她的小屋，被烧死在烈焰中。这样，这位女公爵，就把那不知从什么时代起即为氏族所有的七十九万四千英亩土地，占为己有了。”（资本论）
    这就是新兴的资本主义如何把农民的劳动工具转化为资本，把农民变作劳动力的后备。这也就是产生工业资本主义发展所必需的无产阶级的手段。
    有了这样没有任何组织传统的失业大军，就可以把工资标准降低到最低限度。结果，小孩子在很小的时候也必须参加工作。
    他们没有工会组织，每天必须工作十五小时到十六小时。直到1816年，英国斯托克波尔地方还有九个工人因为企图组织一个工会，被判处二年徒刑。
    1836年有位作家写道：“有一百万人以上是在饿死的边缘上，而这个数字仍在不断地增加着。”在当时，英格兰的人口总共不过几百万人。
    这里是十一岁的汤姆斯·克拉克向调查工厂童工情况的人所作的证述。他说：“如果我们打瞌睡，他们就用鞭子抽打我们……开斯尔（工头）手里经常拿着同我的大拇指一样粗的、双股的、打了结的绳子……我总是在清早六点不到，有时是五点钟就到工厂里去，一直工作到晚上九点……我一个星期约赚四先令（约合人民币一元三角）……有时我弟弟替我的班。他刚七岁。我没有给他任何报酬……如果他不是我的弟弟，每个星期我必须给他一个先令。”
    最初，这些昔日的农民盲目地反抗，发动暴乱和打毁机器，企图阻碍工业的发展。这是自然的、但是无效的反抗。很多年以后，他们才认识到，不管他们愿意不愿意，他们已经成为工人，他们必须团结起来保卫他们的利益和为社会主义而奋斗。
    资本主义用它盲目的和残酷的办法，的确增加了生产和发展了工业——但是比起社会主义国家的工业发展来，缓慢得多。资本主义的工业发展使英国人民与一切殖民地的人民付出了极高的代价。资本主义是通过繁荣、萧条、大规模的失业、多数人贫困和少数人发财、战争和灾难来推进的。
    严格说来，英国现在没有农民阶级。英国的农场是资本主义的农场。农场里的劳动者是拿工资的、有工会组织的工人。他们大部分人在大的机械化的农场工作。英国的工人现在已经忘记了他们是从农民变来的。他们面前的任务是推翻这个世界上最古老的和最有经验的资产阶级。
    在中国，情况是不同的。当然，正如英国一样，在封建主义下，人民的生活情况不可能有任何改善。城乡交流必须增加。问题是：在中国如何实现工业和农业革命——用资本主义的方法还是用社会主义的方法？
    资本主义的方法，像在英国发生过的情形一样，是无政府状态的竞争，每个人为了自己，落后的遭殃，进展缓慢，起伏不定。少数人的幸福建筑在多数人的痛苦上，而且还有战争的威胁。在现在的条件下，这个方法对中国意味着变为美国的半殖民地，意味着大批农民的贫困与他们被当作廉价的劳动力去为私人经营的工厂干活，还意味着地主在农村的复辟。在解放前，有过许多中国的小汤姆斯·克拉克。如果资本主义完全复辟，那就会有几百万的汤姆斯·克拉克。
    社会主义的道路，就是中国正在“建设现代化工业与现代化农业”这个口号下所走的道路——不是使农民阶级极端贫困，而是逐渐地发展工人阶级的农业人口。这里没有圈地运动，没有乞丐队伍，也没有因找不到工作被割掉耳朵或绞死的事情。这里的发展是稳定的和有计划的。每个人的生活随着经济的发展而日益改善。这里没有少数人享福和多数人贫困的现象。城乡不是矛盾的，而是互相支援的。哪里有利害冲突，就用民主的方式，讨论解决。
    英国的历史和中国的历史的对照，很清楚地表明了，社会主义的道路是农民最有前途的道路。
