Xinhua News Agency, Washington, November 21st: French Foreign Minister Pineau, after talks with U.S. Secretary of State Dulles, left Washington for New York by plane on the 20th. In his statement before departure, he admitted that the differences between France and the United States and Britain over the issue of U.S. and British arms shipments to Tunisia had not been resolved.

Pineau went to New York to lead the French delegation to the United Nations General Assembly debate on the Algerian question, which begins next week. Upon arriving in New York, he stated that after the Algerian debate, he might return to Washington for another series of talks with Dulles to discuss important issues between France and the United States.

On the same day, U.S. State Department spokesman White, at a press conference, spoke about the results of the Dulles-Pineau talks. He said that the United States and France had reached a “understanding in principle” on the procedures for supplying arms to Tunisia, but no plan had been formulated for dealing with Western arms supplies to Tunisia. Regarding the Algerian question, which the two sides had discussed, White declined to say whether the United States would support France's position in the United Nations General Assembly debate.

According to news from Paris, the French newspapers were greatly dissatisfied with the results of the U.S.-French talks. "Paris Presse's" headline was: "Apart from a guarantee of consultation, Pineau got nothing from Dulles." "France Soir" said: "Difficult to reach an agreement." "Le Figaro's" headline was: "The Pineau-Dulles talks took place in an unpleasant atmosphere after the Secretary of State held a frustrating press conference."

    法美在北非矛盾未能消除
    比诺白跑了华盛顿一遭
    新华社21日讯　华盛顿消息：法国外交部长比诺同美国国务卿杜勒斯会谈以后，已经在20日乘飞机离开华盛顿去纽约。他在起飞前发表的谈话里承认，法国同美英两国在美英运送武器给突尼斯问题上的分歧并没有消除。
    比诺去纽约是为了率领法国代表团参加下周开始的联合国大会关于阿尔及利亚问题的辩论。他在抵达纽约时表示，在阿尔及利亚辩论结束后，他还可能再度去华盛顿同杜勒斯举行另外一系列会谈来讨论法美之间的重要问题。
    同一天，美国国务院发言人怀特在记者招待会上谈到杜勒斯同比诺的会谈结果。他说，美法两国已经就供给突尼斯武器的程序“在原则上达成谅解”，但是并没有制定出有关处理西方对突尼斯供给军火问题的任何计划。关于双方曾经讨论的阿尔及利亚问题，怀特拒绝说明美国在联合国大会的辩论中是否将支持法国的立场。
    据来自巴黎的消息说，法国报纸对美法会谈结果大为不满。“巴黎新闻”的头号大标题是：“除了进行协商的保证以外，比诺从杜勒斯那里什么也没有得到。”“法兰西晚报”说：“难于取得协议。”“费加罗报”的标题是：“比诺—杜勒斯会谈是在国务卿举行了一次令人沮丧的记者招待会以后的不愉快情况下举行的。”
