Being Able to Endure Hardships and Maintain Close Ties with the Masses
Farmers in the Suburbs of Beijing Praise the Sent-Down Cadres as Excellent

(Our Dispatch) "The cadres who have come to our agricultural cooperative to participate in labor and production are truly outstanding. They observe discipline, endure hardships, and maintain close ties with the masses. In another year or six months, they will surely be just like farmers." This is the comment of farmers in the suburbs of Beijing on the sent-down cadres from Beijing.

Eating, Living, and Laboring with Farmers, Humbly Learning from Farmers

The reporter recently visited Fengtai, Nanyuan, Haidian, and the eastern suburbs, and deeply felt that the farmers' comments were justified. According to the reporter's understanding, most of the more than 10,000 cadres recently sent down to the suburbs of Beijing are performing satisfactorily in their labor and production. When they were first sent down, it was the busy season for agricultural affairs in the suburbs, especially for vegetable production cooperatives, where various vegetables were about to be harvested, requiring the gathering of cabbage, digging of cellars, construction of seedbeds, drying of manure, and loading of manure. All of this usually involves relatively heavy labor. However, many sent-down cadres participated in these heavy labor activities with a cheerful attitude. They did whatever the cooperative members did, went to work when the cooperative members went to work, and stopped work when the cooperative members stopped work, truly achieving eating, living, and laboring together with the farmers. Although some people were initially sore from the work, developed blisters on their hands, and cracks on their heels, and also had difficulties due to lack of technical skills, they gritted their teeth, persevered, and humbly learned from the farmers, and these difficulties were gradually overcome. Song Baosen, a cadre from the Beijing Supply and Marketing Cooperative who was sent down to Xishan Township, had never done any farm work before. When he went down this time, he hadn't even finished a tenth of an acre of sweet potatoes before his back was so sore he couldn't stand up straight. And many of the sweet potatoes he dug up were only halves or small pieces. He wasn't discouraged, but instead watched how the farmers dug. Now, not only can he dig, but he can dig two or three tenths of an acre at a time. Yang Chunrong, a cadre from the Beijing Planning Commission, after being sent down to the Red Star Collective Farm, would ask the veteran cooperative members for advice whenever he didn't understand something. After more than a month, he had gone from knowing nothing to being a qualified cart driver. Female cadres from the Beijing Fifth Construction Engineering Company who were sent down to Jinzhan Township in the eastern suburbs were unable to meet their quota when picking cotton on the first day. They were very anxious, so the next day they went to the fields earlier than the average cooperative members and picked more than on the first day, but still didn't meet the quota. The third day, they didn't even rest at noon and exceeded the quota. After a certain period of labor training, the quantity and quality of work of a considerable number of sent-down cadres has become comparable to that of ordinary cooperative members. Cao Jiuwen, from the Beijing Supply and Marketing Cooperative who was sent down to Xishan Township, built seedbeds alongside the cooperative members. Ordinary cooperative members built one and a half seedbeds a day, and he also built one and a half. Jia Berlin, a cadre from the Soviet Exhibition Hall who was sent down to Mentou Village, after a short period of training, can now dig more than nine tenths of an acre of sweet potatoes a day, about the same as the average cooperative member. Some of the sent-down cadres at the Nanyuan Red Star Collective Farm earned more than 200 work points in just over half a month, with the highest reaching 300 points, comparable to the earnings of ordinary cooperative members. These cadres from intellectual backgrounds not only participated in heavy labor, but also did agricultural work that some intellectuals had always disliked and considered too dirty. For example, "manure," which is indispensable for farming. In the past, cadres from intellectual backgrounds would cover their noses when they saw it, but now? Some people spend all day drying and loading manure, dealing with manure all the time. Duan Ruijin and Song Yulin, cadres from Haidian District who were sent down to the Si Ji Qing Vegetable Production Cooperative, had only been there for a short time when the cooperative was drying manure. They worked with the cooperative members to scoop the liquid manure out of the manure pits and transport it to the fields to spread it out to dry. After drying manure all day, their clothes were covered in the stench, but they gradually got used to it. Zhang Guozhong, another sent-down cadre at the cooperative, had some manure slag fly into his mouth and nostrils while working with the cooperative members to load dry manure slag. Under these circumstances, he continued to work just like the cooperative members.

Settling Down in the Countryside and Focusing on Agricultural Production

As labor enthusiasm rose, the attendance rate of sent-down cadres also increased. In many areas of Fengtai District, the attendance rate reached 100%. Some people at the Si Ji Qing Vegetable Production Cooperative did not miss a single day in the month they were there. In order to increase attendance and focus on production in the countryside, many people brought their families to settle down in the countryside. A cadre surnamed Xiang from a unit directly under the Beijing Municipal People's Committee brought his wife and children after arriving in Xishan Township. He went to work at sunrise and finished at sunset, just like the cooperative members. When it was necessary to work overtime at night during the rice harvest, he would eat dinner and then go to the fields, working until after ten o'clock, just like the cooperative members. Ten sent-down cadres in Yuegezhuang, Fengtai District, also settled down in the village.

When the sent-down cadres participated in labor with full enthusiasm, the cooperative and team leaders paid special attention to arranging farm work suitable for their physical strength. At the same time, they paid attention to adjustments in the actual labor process to avoid overworking the sent-down cadres, while still ensuring they received the necessary training. The Zhongjie Friendship Cooperative in Fengtai District first assigned the sent-down cadres to lighter work such as picking peanuts and breaking corn, and then assigned them to heavier farm work such as threshing and sowing wheat. When digging cabbage cellars in some teams in Dongran Village Township, the team leaders first asked them to dig soil blocks, and when they saw that they were tired, they asked them to throw the soil blocks. When they were even more tired, they asked them to climb on top of the cabbage cellar and tamp the soil blocks firmly. After they recovered from their fatigue, they were asked to dig soil blocks again. This kind of cordial care and consideration from the cooperative and team leaders further encouraged the sent-down cadres' enthusiasm for labor and production.

Solving Difficulties Themselves and Being Closely Connected to the Farmers

Many sent-down cadres also overcame various difficulties in their lives. For example, regarding the housing problem, there were originally no extra houses in the suburbs. With the sudden influx of more than 10,000 cadres, difficulties naturally arose. However, many cadres overcame this difficulty. Some lived in the team office, some lived in the homes of cooperative members, and more commonly, they repaired the empty, dilapidated small houses in the cooperative themselves. E Li-quan, a sent-down cadre from the Youth Team of the Si Ji Qing Vegetable Production Cooperative, worked early and late, using his noon break to repair a house with drafts coming from all four walls. Although the house was small, he was very satisfied with it. Some people didn't have hot water to wash their faces in the morning, so they used carts to fetch water from nearby wells to wash their faces and rinse their mouths before going to work. Many people changed their original living habits. The most common change was switching from eating three meals a day to eating two meals of dry rice, in order to adapt to the living habits and working hours of the farmers.

The sent-down cadres also developed close ties with the farmers. They always chatted with the farmers and read newspapers during breaks and meals. The cadres who lived in the homes of cooperative members also swept the yards and fetched water for the cooperative members early in the morning and late at night. Cao Jiuwen and Song Baosen, sent-down cadres in Xishan Township, lived in the home of cooperative member Chen Sibao. Sometimes Chen Sibao's family hadn't even gotten out of bed yet, and they had already quietly swept the yard clean. Old Mrs. Chen was very touched and treated them like family. Sometimes they came back from a big debate meeting late at night, and the old lady would always stuff them with a piece of sweet potato and say, "Don't starve, eat it!"

Sent-Down Cadres Receive Training, Agricultural Cooperatives Increase Labor Force

All the cadres who actively participated in labor and production and integrated with the farmers received training from the labor and significantly improved their ideological awareness. They universally realized the truth that "every grain of rice and every drop of congee should be cherished as hard-earned." Therefore, many people used examples to educate their families to pay attention to conservation when they went to the city to visit their families. Some people suffering from the common disease of intellectuals—neurasthenia and insomnia—experienced significant improvements in their health. Zhang Jie, a comrade from the Beijing Women's Federation, suffered from insomnia for more than four years and could never be cured. Recently, after participating in labor for a period of time, she can now sleep at night.

After a large number of sent-down cadres actively participated in labor, not only did they receive training themselves, but they also solved the problem of labor shortage in agricultural production cooperatives. The Guo Changzhuang Brigade of the Red October Agricultural Cooperative in Fengtai District was preparing to allocate 300 acres of land to other cooperatives because they had a lot of land and not enough people. This time, their cooperative accepted more than 100 sent-down cadres and no longer allocated land to other cooperatives. Moreover, the active labor of the sent-down cadres also changed the social atmosphere in the countryside and changed the incorrect thinking of some rural youth who were not focused on agricultural production and wanted to go to the big cities. In the past, more than 100 young and middle-aged farmers in the Dongfanghong Agricultural Production Cooperative wanted to become technicians, workers, and cadres, and more than 50 people were constantly running around looking for work and not attending work. Now, more than 30 people have returned to their hometowns to participate in production. In addition, it has also changed the farmers' views on intellectual cadres. At the beginning of the sent-down movement, many cooperative and team leaders believed that "sent-down cadres are highly educated and difficult to lead." Therefore, no one wanted to accept them. The farmers thought, "How can these people work? They must be here to do work for us." Now the cooperative and team leaders often ask the township and district for sent-down cadres, complaining that the leaders gave them too few in the past. When the farmers are mentioned, they always give a thumbs up and say, "Excellent!"

A Few People Are Not Active in Labor But Have Special Lifestyles

Of course, among the sent-down cadres, there are also some people who are not active in labor, are picky about their work, and even leave without permission. Some people have special lifestyles and cannot integrate with the farmers. Some sent-down cadres, as soon as they arrive, ask the cooperative to build collective dormitories and collective kitchens for them, causing the cooperative to increase its expenses and the cooperative members to be dissatisfied. Some cadres complain that the food in the countryside is not good and bring butter, bread, and canned goods with them when they go down. After they go down, they also complain that the farmers are dirty. Although there are not many such cadres, the farmers have a lot of opinions about them. They say, "This is not coming to work, they have such big habits, like young masters and young ladies coming!" This phenomenon should attract the attention of relevant units, and these cadres should be educated. (Attached pictures)

### 既能吃苦耐劳　又能联系群众  北京郊区农民赞扬下放干部真棒

    既能吃苦耐劳　又能联系群众
    北京郊区农民赞扬下放干部真棒
    本报讯　“到咱们农业社里来劳动生产的干部真是好样儿的，守纪律，能吃苦耐劳，又能联系群众，一年半载以后，准保就像农民了。”这是北京市郊区农民对北京市下放干部的评语。
    和农民同吃同住同劳动，虚心向农民学习
    记者最近访问了丰台、南苑、海淀、东郊等区，深深感到农民的评语是有道理的。据记者了解：北京市最近下放到郊区的一万多名干部中，大部分干部劳动生产的状况是令人满意的。他们下放之初，正是郊区农事繁忙的季节，特别是蔬菜生产合作社，各种蔬菜都快收藏了，需要收白菜、挖菜窖、打阳畦、晾粪、装粪，这一切，通常都是比较繁重的劳动。但是，许多下放干部以愉快的心情参加了这些繁重的劳动，社员干什么活，他们就干什么活，社员上工，他们上工，社员下工，他们下工，真正做到了和农民同吃、同住、同劳动。有些人虽然在开始时也曾累得腰酸背疼，手上磨起了泡，脚跟裂开了缝，同时加上技术不熟练，干起活来有困难，但是他们咬紧牙关，坚持下去，并虚心向农民学习，这些困难也就慢慢克服了。北京市供销合作社下放到西山乡的干部宋保森过去什么农活都没有干过，这次下去，开始刨白薯时，还没有刨上一分地，就累得腰也立不直，而刨出来的白薯，好多是半个或者一小块，他没有灰心，而是去看农民怎么刨。现在，他不仅会刨了，而且可以一连刨上二、三分地。北京市计划委员会干部杨春荣，下放到红星集体农庄以后，遇有一点不懂的地方，都随时向老社员请教，经过一个多月的时间，已经由一窍不通，变成一名够格的赶车把式。北京市第五建筑工程公司下放到东郊区金盏乡的女干部，第一天摘棉花时，达不到定额，她们心里挺着急，第二天就比一般社员早下地，比第一天摘得多了，但还是没有达到定额，第三天中午也不休息，就超过定额了。相当一部分下放干部在经过一定时期的劳动锻炼以后，活计的数量和质量和一般社员已经不相上下。北京市供销合作社下放到西山乡的曹九文和社员一齐打阳畦时，普通社员一天打一个半，他也是打一个半；苏联展览馆干部贾柏林下放到门头村经过短期锻炼后，现在一天能刨九分多地白薯，和一般社员差不多。南苑红星集体农庄的一些下放干部，在半个多月当中，一般的都挣了二百多分，最多的达到三百分，和一般社员所得不相上下。这一些知识分子出身的干部，不仅仅参加了繁重的劳动，即使对于一些知识分子从来就看不顺眼，认为太脏的农活，他们也是照样干。比如庄稼活离不了的“粪”，过去知识分子出身的干部一见到它，就会掩鼻而过，现在呢？有些人却整天晾粪、装粪，和粪打交道。海淀区下放到四季青蔬菜生产合作社的干部段瑞金、宋玉琳，下去不久，正逢社里晒大粪，他们就和社员一起把稀粪从粪坑里掏出来，再运到场地摊平晒干，晒了一天粪以后，衣服上都沾满了臭气，他们也渐渐习惯了。该社另一下放干部张国忠和社员一齐装干粪渣时，嘴巴和鼻孔里也飞进了一些粪渣，在这样情况下，他仍和社员一样干。
    在农村安家落户安心农业生产
    随着劳动热情的高涨，下放干部的出勤率也很高。丰台区许多人的出勤率达到百分之百，四季青蔬菜生产合作社有些人下去一个月当中，一天也没有缺勤。为了提高出勤率，安心在农村生产，许多人把家属接来，在农村安家落户。北京市人民委员会直属单位有一个姓向的干部到西山乡后，将爱人孩子都带来了，他每天和社员一样，日出上工，日落收工，割稻时，晚上需要加班，他也和社员一样吃好晚饭后再下地，一直干到十点多钟。丰台区岳各庄也有十个下放干部在该庄安家落户。
    当下放干部怀着满腔热情参加劳动的时候，社、队领导上特别注意了安排适合他们体力的农活，同时，在实际劳动中，又随时注意调整，避免下放干部过分劳累，但又得到应有的锻炼。丰台区中捷友好社先分给下放干部拣花生、掰玉米等较轻的活，然后再分配他们打场、种麦等较重的农活。东冉村乡有些队在挖白菜窖时，队领导上先叫他们挖土块，看看他们累了，就叫他们扔土块，再累了，就叫他们爬在菜窖上面把土块踏实，一会儿恢复了疲劳以后，又叫他们挖土块。社、队领导上这种亲切的关怀和照顾，更加鼓舞了下放干部劳动生产的热情。
    自己动手解决困难和农民亲密无间
    许多下放干部还克服了生活上的种种困难。比如居住问题，郊区原来并没有多余空房，一下子下放了一万多干部，当然会发生困难；但是，许多干部克服了这一困难，有的住在队办公室里，有的住在社员家里，更普遍的是他们自己动手将社里空着的破旧的小屋重新修理。四季青蔬菜生产合作社青年队下放干部鄂丽泉起早带晚，利用中午休息的时间，把一间四壁通风的房子修好了，虽然这座房子很矮小，但是他住得很满意。有些人早上没有热水洗脸，他们就用车到附近水井里推点水回来，洗洗脸、嗽嗽口就下地干活了。许多人改变了原来的生活习惯，最普遍的是，目前已由吃三顿饭改吃二顿干饭，以便适应农民的生活习惯和劳动时间。
    下放干部还和农民有了亲密的血肉联系，他们在休息、吃饭的时候，总是找农民聊天、读报。住在社员家里的干部，还起早摸黑给社员打扫院子，挑水。西山乡下放干部曹九文和宋保森住在社员陈四保家，有时陈四保一家还没有起床，他们已轻轻地将院子打扫好了，陈家老太太非常感动，把他们当亲人。有时他们深更半夜开完大辩论会回来，老太太总要塞一块白薯给他们说：“别饿坏了，吃吧！”
    下放干部受到了锻炼农业社增加了劳动力
    凡是积极参加劳动生产和农民打成一片的干部，他们都从劳动中得到了锻炼，思想觉悟有显著提高，普遍体会到“一粥一饭当思来处不易”的道理，因此，许多人在进城看望家属时，都以实例教育家属注意节约，有些患知识分子通病——神经衰弱，失眠症的人，身体有了显著好转，北京市妇联的张节同志，患失眠症四年多，总是治不好，最近下去劳动了一个时期后，夜里已可睡觉了。
    大批下放干部积极参加劳动以后，不仅他们自己获得了锻炼，还解决了农业生产合作社缺乏劳动力的困难。丰台区红十月农业社郭常庄大队，因为地多人少，曾准备拨给其他社三百亩地，这次他们社接受了一百多名下放干部，就不再往外拨地了。不仅如此，下放干部积极劳动的结果，还转变了农村的社会风气，转变了部分农村青年不安心农业生产想上大城市的不正确思想。东方红农业生产合作社过去有一百多名青壮年农民想当技术员、当工人、当干部，有五十多人整天东奔西走，找工作，不出勤，现在已有三十多人回乡参加生产。另外，还改变了农民对知识分子干部的看法，在开始下放时，许多社、队领导上曾认为：“下放干部文化高，很难领导。”因此，谁也不愿接受。农民认为：“凭这些人怎能劳动？一定又是给我们做工作来了”。现在社、队领导上经常向乡里、区里要下放干部，怨领导上过去给的太少了，农民呢？一提起他们，总是大拇指一竖说：“真棒”。
    少数人劳动不积极生活却很特殊
    当然，在下放干部中，也还有部分人劳动不积极，干活挑肥拣瘦，甚至不假而归。有些人在生活上特殊，不能和农民打成一片，有些下放干部一下去，就要社里给他们造集体宿舍，集体伙房，弄得合作社增加开支，社员不满。有些干部嫌农村吃得不好，下去时，带了黄油、面包、罐头，下去后，又嫌农民脏。这样的干部虽然不多，但是农民的意见却很大，他们说：“这那里是劳动来了，习气这样大，像做少爷、小姐来啦！”这种现象应该引起有关单位的注意，并对这些干部进行教育。（附图片）
