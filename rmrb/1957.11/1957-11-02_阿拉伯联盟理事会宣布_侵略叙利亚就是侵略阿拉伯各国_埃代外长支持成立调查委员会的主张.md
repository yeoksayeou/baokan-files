Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, November 1st: The Arab League Council unanimously adopted a resolution on October 31st, declaring that any aggression against Syria is an aggression against all Arab countries, and that Arab countries will unite to confront such aggression in accordance with the Arab League Charter.

    This resolution was adopted at the first meeting of the twenty-eighth session of the Arab League Council. All member states of the League attended the meeting.

    The resolution condemned "actions such as exerting pressure on Syria, threatening it, and concentrating troops on its borders, as well as attempts to interfere in its internal affairs." The resolution pointed out: "All of this is incompatible with the principles and charter of the United Nations."

    The resolution also emphasized that Syria has every right to safeguard its independence and sovereignty.

    This resolution has been telegraphed to the Secretary-General of the United Nations and the current President of the General Assembly for forwarding to all member states.

    Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, November 1st: "Al-Ahram" reported that Egyptian Minister of State and Acting Foreign Minister Ali Sabri requested the United Nations to accept Syria's proposal to the United Nations to establish a commission of inquiry at a meeting of the Arab Affairs Committee of the National Assembly on October 30 to discuss the situation in Syria and Oman.

    Sabri said that sending only a United Nations representative to investigate Syria's accusations against Turkey would not bring the results people expect. He believes that the current tension on the Syrian-Turkish border is due to American instigation.

    Sabri also said that Egypt's dispatch of armed forces to Syria is to implement the military agreement between the two countries and for self-defense. He told the committee that steps to enhance the unity between Egypt and Syria are proceeding according to plan.

    The committee expressed its approval of the current Egyptian government's policy on the Syrian issue and thanked the government for the steps it has already taken.

    Xinhua News Agency, November 1st: TASS, Ankara, November 1st: According to the "Yeni Ulus" newspaper, Turkish Defense Minister Erkin flew to Gaziantep on October 30th.

    Gaziantep is located in southern Turkey, not far from the Syrian border, which is where Turkish troops are currently concentrated.
