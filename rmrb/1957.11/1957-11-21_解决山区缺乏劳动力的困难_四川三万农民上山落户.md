Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 18th. Mountainous agricultural cooperatives in northern Sichuan, such as Pingwu, Qingchuan, Jiange, and Beichuan counties, have received and settled more than 30,000 farmers who have moved to the mountains. These farmers migrated from the Suining Special District. They have now settled down in the mountains.

Due to the abundance of land and the scarcity of people and labor in the mountainous areas, the farmers there are eager to increase the labor force. In August of this year, when farmers from Suining, Santai, Shehong, and other counties sent representatives to the mountains to negotiate, the mountain farmers expressed a warm welcome, especially to farmers with skills and education. After the agricultural cooperatives on both sides had negotiated and coordinated, the farmers from the plains moved to the mountains in batches. The mountain farmers properly helped them solve the difficulties of housing, agricultural tools, and daily necessities. Some lent part of their surplus houses to the newly relocated cooperative members, while others voluntarily lent their surplus farm tools and pots and pans to the new cooperative members. When the new cooperative members did not know how to use mountain farming tools, the local veteran cooperative members enthusiastically introduced them to the methods of use.

The warm care of the mountain farmers greatly moved the farmers who had moved up, and their enthusiasm for production was very high. They expressed that they would work hard to build the mountain areas well.

    解决山区缺乏劳动力的困难
    四川三万农民上山落户
    新华社成都18日电　四川北部平武、青川、剑阁、北川等县山区农业社，已经接待和安置了三万多上山农民。这批农民是从遂宁专区迁入的。现在，他们已在山区安下了家。
    由于山区地多人少，劳动力缺乏，山区农民渴望着增加劳动力。今年8月，遂宁、三台、射洪等县农民派代表上山接洽时，山区农民表示非常欢迎，特别是对有技术、有文化的农民上山尤其欢迎。经过双方农业社和农业社商谈挂好钩后，山下农民便分批上山。山上农民妥善地帮助他们解决住房、农具和生活用具等的困难。有的把自己多余的房子让出一部分借给迁入的新社员住，有的主动把多余的农具和锅碗等借给新社员用。新社员不会使用山地农具，当地老社员就热心地给他们介绍使用方法。
    山区农民的热情关怀使上山农民非常感动，他们的生产情绪都很高，表示一定要努力把山区建设好。
