Tianjin Special District Sees New Upsurge in Water Conservancy Construction

(Our Newspaper) News - Based on the socialist great debate and the victory of transforming low-lying areas, Tianjin Special District, Hebei Province, has further launched a water conservancy construction campaign centered on transforming low-lying areas. While busy with the autumn harvest and wheat watering, all parts of the district organized a 140,000-strong water conservancy army to invest in water conservancy construction projects.

Tianjin Special District has more than 13 million mu of cultivated land, most of which is located in low-lying areas, suffering from floods seven out of ten years. Through vigorous farmland water conservancy construction over the past three years, 5 million mu of low-lying areas have been transformed, ensuring a large increase in grain production. According to the district's plan, 349 new sluices and culverts will be built in 1958, and the area of transformed low-lying areas will increase to 6 million mu. High-yield crops in low-lying areas—rice and "dian rice"—will be developed to 2 million to 2.5 million mu, striving to produce 2.5 billion jin of grain. After the implementation of this plan, the district's grain output will increase by 45% compared to this year.

The funds needed for water conservancy projects will mostly come from the masses, with only a portion of the main buildings being built by the state, and some larger buildings being subsidized by the cooperative. At present, the masses are actively raising funds in the spirit of "spending less money, doing more things, and transforming low-lying areas diligently and frugally." To solve the problem of water conservancy funds, each cooperative has appropriately increased its accumulation this year. Fumin Cooperative in Jinghai County only retained 50,000 yuan last year, and still encountered many difficulties in the project; this year, on the premise of ensuring that the income of the members increases, 200,000 yuan will be retained, so that the funds for the project and production are all self-sufficient. Many cooperatives are actively arranging sideline production to support water conservancy projects with sideline income.

As early as August this year, the Tianjin Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China formulated the 1958 plan for transforming low-lying areas. From the Prefectural Committee to the County Committees, work fronts were divided, with the first secretaries personally leading water conservancy work, and established low-lying area transformation committees, and established or improved low-lying area transformation offices. Districts, townships, and cooperatives also established committees or groups of the same nature headed by the main cadres. More than 30 county-level cadres and more than 400 other cadres were also transferred and assigned to larger low-lying areas and depressions, stationed on-site for a long time, and working full-time to lead this work. Some major depressions have been headed by the county party secretary, members, or county head to establish committees.

Due to the strict organization and specific leadership, the low-lying area transformation movement quickly showed a momentum of thousands of troops and horses. At present, under the slogan of "one square of water, one dan of grain, one drop of water, one grain of rice," the masses are building projects, storing water, and using water at the same time. In the process of building projects, they use machines, water dragons, water buckets, and washbasins to store river water and well water in low-lying areas and on the ground for watering wheat and white land, and plan to continue until before the Qingming Festival next year in order to effectively resist drought.

### 群众出钱出力改造洼地  天津专区出现水利建设新高潮

    群众出钱出力改造洼地
    天津专区出现水利建设新高潮
    本报讯　在社会主义大辩论、改造洼地获胜的基础上，河北省天津专区进一步展开了以改造洼地为中心的水利建设运动。全区各地在繁忙的秋收和浇麦的同时，组织了十四万水利大军投入水利建设工程。
    天津专区有耕地一千三百多万亩，绝大部分处在低洼地区，十年七涝。三年来经过大力兴修农田水利，已经改造洼地五百万亩，保证了粮食大量增产。按照全区计划，1958年度将新建三百四十九座闸涵，改造洼地面积将增加到六百万亩，洼地的高产作物——水稻、淀稻将发展到二百万——二百五十万亩，争取生产粮食二十五亿斤。实现这个计划以后，全区粮食产量将比今年增产45％。
    水利工程所需要的资金，绝大部分将取之于群众，只有一部分主要建筑物将由国家举办，一部分较大建筑社办公助。目前群众正本着“少花钱、多办事、勤俭改造洼地”的精神，积极筹措资金。为了解决水利资金问题，今年各社都适当增加一部分积累。静海县富民社去年只扣留了五万元，在工程上仍然碰到了许多困难；今年在保证社员增加收入的前提下，扣留二十万元，作到工程、生产用款全部自给。许多合作社正在积极地安排副业生产，以副业收入支持水利工程。
    早在今年8月，中共天津地委就拟订了1958年度的改造洼地计划。从地委到各县委都划分了工作战线，由第一书记亲自领导水利工作，并建立了洼地改造委员会，建立或健全了洼地改造办公室。区、乡、社也以主要干部为首建立了同样性质的委员会或小组。还抽调了三十多名县级干部，四百多名其它干部，分配到较大的洼淀，长期驻在现场，专职领导这一工作。一些主要的大洼，都由县委书记、委员或县长亲自挂帅成立了委员会。
    由于组织严密，领导具体，洼地改造运动很快出现了千军万马之势。目前，群众正在“一方水、一担粮、一滴水、一粒米”的口号下，一面作工程，一面蓄水，一面利用水。在作工程过程中，使用机器、水龙、水斗子以及洗脸盆等工具，把河水、井水蓄在洼内、存在地里，进行浇麦和浇白地，并且打算一直搞到明年清明节前，以便有效地抗御干旱。
