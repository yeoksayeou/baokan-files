Xinhua News Agency, Rome, November 23rd: According to TASS, the Italian Communist Party delegation that participated in the 40th anniversary celebrations of the October Revolution returned to Rome on the 22nd. The head of the delegation, the General Secretary of the Italian Communist Party Central Committee, Togliatti, issued a statement to "l'Unità" after returning home.

The statement first emphasized that the 40th anniversary celebration of the October Revolution brilliantly demonstrated the power, unity, and solidarity of the socialist camp. He said that socialism, which is being built in vast areas of the world under the leadership of the Communist Party, has increasingly manifested its moral and material superiority. The socialist camp is becoming increasingly consolidated on the basis of defending peace, democracy, the welfare of the working people, and the highest interests of scientific progress.

The statement continued that the Italian Communist Party delegation took advantage of this visit to Moscow to meet with the leaders of Communist Parties from all over the world and exchange opinions, thereby strengthening mutual solidarity and unity. Although in different countries, everyone is moving forward along a common path. "Consistent principles and common goals unite us all. We are united in the struggle for socialism and for peace."
