Leading Cadres Take the Lead; Pay Attention to Rectification and Reform While Rectifying
Sichuan and Shanxi Provincial Organs Enter Climax of Free Airing of Views

This newspaper reports that Sichuan province-level organs entered the third stage of the rectification campaign in mid-October, and a new climax of free airing of views has emerged. In the financial and trade systems alone, over 90% of people offered opinions in just over ten days, posting nearly 10,000 big-character posters. The Planning Department of the Provincial People's Bank had eighteen cadres, who submitted over 1,200 opinions, averaging more than sixty opinions per person.

The characteristics of this period of free airing of views are: more significant issues related to principles, policies, institutions, systems, and work operations, and fewer issues related to living welfare; not only criticisms and suggestions, but even specific plans; many opinions are not only well-intentioned but also sharp and accurate.

The participation of leading cadres in the free airing of views is also a characteristic of this period. After the deputy director of the Department of Agriculture freely aired his views at a cadre meeting, cadres above the section and division levels followed suit and posted big-character posters. The Provincial Industrial System held a meeting on November 12th and 13th, gathering more than 120 people including directors and deputy directors of departments and bureaus, and section chiefs to freely air their views, raising many significant issues. The Department of Transportation held a three-level cadre meeting, bringing together more than 100 people including managers and station masters of transportation companies from various regions, cadres above section chief level within the department, as well as representatives of automobile drivers and repair workers, who freely aired their views, posting a total of more than 680 big-character posters in three days. At the same time, many organs also paid attention to mobilizing middle-level cadres and Party and Youth League members to take the lead in freely airing their views.

Many organs also paid attention to rectification and reform work, which further promoted the in-depth development of the movement. Many organs have established "Improvement Groups," assigning dedicated personnel to sort out the criticisms and suggestions from the masses, classify them, and improve work based on the principle of "easy first, difficult later." For some major issues, the masses' suggestions are first summarized, and improvement plans are proposed, then submitted to the masses for discussion, and then comprehensively sorted out and implemented after being approved by the leadership. Experience has shown that the more bold, resolute, and thorough the reforms, the more welcome they are by the masses. For example, the Party organizations of some organs in the Provincial Transportation System, with a revolutionary attitude and a high degree of principled spirit, took decisive measures to address the situation of the spouses of twenty-four leading cadres above the section chief level having excessively high ranks, being unable to work for a long time due to illness, or being incompetent in their work. After full persuasion and education, they were respectively given demotions, downgrades, job transfers, suspension of pay, and persuaded to resign. This further encouraged the enthusiasm of the masses to freely air their views.

In the process of rectification and reform, some organs also paid attention to closely integrating rectification and reform with current work. For example, in order to correctly formulate the province's second five-year plan for industrial development, the Industrial Department, in addition to sending people to conduct in-depth investigations and research in various regions, also convened a meeting of cadres above the section chief level in the department, focusing on discussing how local industries could serve agriculture. In order to implement the forty articles of the Agricultural Development Program, the Department of Agriculture, in response to the lack of practical business skills such as "rice experts" not knowing how to transplant rice seedlings, decided to operate the thirty acres of land within the department themselves. All cadres and technicians who could participate in labor would participate in practical operations to explore the experience of high-yield production.

This newspaper reports that since entering the third stage of the rectification movement, the Shanxi province-level organs have generally launched a new climax of free airing of views.

The Shanxi Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a meeting of responsible Party cadres of provincial organs at the end of October, making important preparations for promoting the forward development of the movement. Tao Lujia, First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, made a report on the tasks of the third stage of the rectification movement at the meeting. This report enabled the leading cadres of various units to further understand the important significance of the current stage of the movement, and clarified that launching a new climax of free airing of views is the primary link to achieve the goal of rectifying and reforming while rectifying, thereby eliminating the slackening phenomenon that had once appeared, and the movement rapidly and enthusiastically developed in a short period of time.

After the meeting, the leading cadres of various units immediately personally convened various meetings, repeatedly explaining the policies to the masses in their units, requiring everyone to completely eliminate concerns, and boldly, resolutely, and thoroughly let go; the leading cadres were determined to set themselves on fire and boldly, resolutely, and thoroughly reform. The director of the Provincial Reserve Materials Bureau and other leading comrades took the lead in posting big-character posters, and some even publicly reviewed their shortcomings. After the masses of the bureau freely aired the opinion that there were too many meetings, a bureau affairs meeting was convened the next day, formally making specific methods and decisions to reduce meetings and improve meeting quality. This greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of the masses to freely air their views.

After nearly two hundred provincial-level organs adopted the above-mentioned various methods, the garden for free airing of views increased day by day, and the walls of various units were filled with red and green big-character posters. According to statistics as of November 9th, more than 100,000 big-character posters related to rectification and reform have been posted by provincial-level organs (an average of three big-character posters were written by each staff member), with more than 100,000 opinions. Among these opinions, many criticisms and suggestions were put forward on institutional systems, personnel systems, Party-mass relations, cadre style, industrial and agricultural production, work systems, living welfare, etc. Tightening up institutions is one of the most discussed issues. Liu Keqin and other comrades from Shanxi Broadcasting Station revealed that the Broadcasting Administration had added twenty people outside of the establishment, resulting in a situation where there were too many people and too little work. Many people had to often read novels and eat early, and suggested drastically tightening up institutions and sending cadres down. After this opinion was put forward, more than 130 Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, and young intellectuals successively posted big-character posters, expressing their willingness to go to the countryside and mountains to become farmers to temper and transform themselves.

Currently, the various units are sorting out and studying the opinions put forward by the masses. The Rectification Office of the Department of Agricultural Construction specially convened a meeting to determine that the affiliated units would uniformly study and arrange business work and rectification work, and assigned dedicated personnel to sort out the big-character posters of their respective units in order to thoroughly improve work and rectify work style through extensive airing of views, extensive debate, and extensive discussion on important issues. Twenty-three pioneer units such as the Provincial Finance Department have entered the stage of in-depth thematic airing of views and debate.

### 领导干部带头　注意边整边改  四川山西省级机关进入鸣放高潮

    领导干部带头　注意边整边改
    四川山西省级机关进入鸣放高潮
    本报讯　四川省一级机关自10月中旬先后转入整风第三阶段，已出现了新的鸣放高潮。仅财经贸易系统十多天当中，就有90％的人提了意见，贴出大字报近一万张。省人民银行计划处有十八个干部，提的意见达一千二百多条，平均每人提了六十多条意见。
    这段时期鸣放的特点是：属于方针、政策、机构、体制和工作业务等方面的重大问题多，属于生活福利方面的少；不仅有批评，有建议，甚至有具体方案；许多意见不仅是善意的，而且很尖锐、很准确。
    领导干部参加鸣放，也是这段时期的特点。农业厅副厅长在干部大会上鸣放后，科处长以上干部都跟着贴出了大字报。省工业系统在11月12、13两天集中了厅长、局长、处长等一百二十多人开会鸣放，提出了许多重大问题。交通厅举行三级干部会，集中了各地运输公司经理、站长和厅内科长以上干部，以及汽车驾驶员、修车工人代表等一百多人鸣放，三天中共贴出了大字报六百八十多张。与此同时，许多机关还注意了发动中层干部和党团员带头鸣放。
    许多机关还注意了整改工作，这就更促进了运动的深入开展。不少机关都成立了“改进小组”，抽出专人整理群众的批评建议，分类排队，本着“先易后难”的原则改进工作。对于一些重大问题，则首先归纳群众建议，提出改进方案，再交群众讨论，然后综合整理，经领导上批准公布施行。经验证明，改的愈大胆、愈坚决、愈彻底，群众愈欢迎。如省交通系统部分机关的党组织以革命的态度和高度的原则精神，采取断然措施，对二十四个处长以上领导干部的爱人级别过高、因病长期不能工作，工作不称职等情况，经过充分的说服教育后，已分别作了降职、降级、调动工作、停薪留职和动员退职的处理。这就更加鼓舞了群众鸣放的积极性。
    在整改中，有些机关还注意了紧密结合当前工作来整改。如工业厅为了正确制定本省工业发展的第二个五年计划，除派人深入各地进行调查研究外，还在厅内召集科长以上干部会议，着重讨论了地方工业如何为农业服务的问题。农业厅为了贯彻农业发展四十条纲要，针对厅内“水稻专家”不会栽秧等缺乏实际业务能力的情况，决定自己经营厅内的三十亩地，所有能参加劳动的干部和技术人员都参加实际操作，用以摸索高额丰产的经验。
    本报讯　山西省级机关自进入整风运动第三阶段以来，已普遍掀起新的鸣放高潮。
    中共山西省委在10月底召开的一次省级机关党员负责干部会议，为促进运动向前发展作了重要的准备。省委第一书记陶鲁笳在会上作了整风运动第三阶段的任务的报告。这个报告使各单位领导干部进一步认识了目前阶段运动的重要意义，明确了掀起新的鸣放高潮是达到边整边改目的的首要环节，从而消除了一度出现的松劲现象，运动在短时期内迅速热烈地开展了起来。
    各单位领导干部在会后立即亲自召集各种会议，反复向本单位群众交代政策，要求大家彻底解除顾虑，大胆地放，坚决地放，彻底地放；领导干部决心引火烧身，大胆地改，坚决地改，彻底地改。省储备物资管理局局长等领导同志带头张贴大字报，有的还公开检讨了自己的缺点。该局群众鸣放出会议过多的意见后，次日就召集局务会议，正式作出减少会议提高会议质量的具体办法和决定。这就大大地鼓舞了群众鸣放的积极性。
    近二百个省级机关单位采取上述种种办法以后，鸣放园地一天一天增多了，各单位的墙壁上，满目皆是红红绿绿的大字报。截至11月9日统计，省级机关张贴的有关整改的大字报已达十余万张（平均每个工作人员写了三张大字报），意见达十万多条。在这些意见中，对机构体制、人事制度、党群关系、干部作风、工农业生产、工作制度、生活福利等方面，提出了许多批评和建议。紧缩机构是谈论得最多的问题之一。山西省广播电台刘克勤等同志揭露出广播管理局在编制以外又增加了二十个人，形成人多事少，不少人只得经常看小说，提前吃饭，建议大刀阔斧地紧缩机构，下放干部。这一意见提出后，有一百三十多个共产党员、共青团员和青年知识分子先后贴出大字报，表示愿意下乡上山当农民锻炼改造自己。
    目前，各单位对群众提出的意见，正在整理研究。农业建设厅整风办公室专门召开了会议，确定所属单位统一研究和安排业务工作和整改工作，责成专人整理本单位的大字报，以便经过对重要问题的大鸣大放大辩论，彻底地改进工作，整顿作风。省财政厅等二十三个先行单位，已走向专题鸣放深入辩论的阶段。
