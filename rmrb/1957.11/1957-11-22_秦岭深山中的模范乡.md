    Model Township in the Deep Mountains of the Qinling Mountains
    By Our Correspondent Zhu Bo
    In early winter, we arrived at Longwangmiao Township in Shangluo County, Shaanxi Province.
    As we just crossed Huangsha Ridge, a beautiful mountain scenery appeared before our eyes. The mountains and valleys were covered with forests, some of which had grown into timber, and some were still young saplings, including pine, cypress, birch, poplar, willow, chestnut, persimmon, and walnut trees, some orange-yellow, some bright red... dressing up this mountainous area in a riot of colors. Streams of mountain springs, like white ribbons, trailed down from the mountains, flowing along the mountain waist canals, past the terraced fields, singing and flowing into the valley.
    Here, we see not the poor mountain area of the past, but a happy paradise. However, the people of Longwangmiao Township have not forgotten the arduous past. They often compare the dark years with the happy times of today to educate themselves and the younger generation.
    In the past, Longwangmiao Township was a remote and poor mountain area. It was full of towering peaks and crisscrossing valleys. The township had one thousand and eighty-four households, with more than nine thousand five hundred mu of cultivated land, scattered in the mountains nearly forty miles long, and most of them were thin, barren land with stones, where a heavy rain would wash away all the seedlings and soil. In a good year, the average yield per mu was only one hundred jin at most, and often the grain harvested in a year was not enough to eat for one season. Therefore, people had to toil all year round for food. Some farmers went out to escape famine or beg for food, and some even moved two or three times a year. Local farmers describe this kind of life as "abundance in spring, half in summer, desolation in autumn, and nothing in winter." In such a difficult life, bandits and landlords often robbed and exploited the farmers. Before liberation, they were also looted by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. After liberation, people returned one after another, and the people's government helped them re-establish their homes. However, because the bandits were not completely eliminated and the landlords were not overthrown, it was not until the work of transforming backward townships in 1955 that the stones pressing on people's hearts were removed. Then, the mutual aid and cooperation movement was launched, and a large-scale production movement focusing on the construction of mountainous areas began.
    In the past two years, the poverty of the mountainous areas has been changed. Everywhere we passed, we could see newly built terraced fields, and many streams of spring water were cut off and diverted into canals. Soil erosion has basically been stopped. In the past, every time there was a flood, many fertile fields and houses would be washed away, but this year, when there was a big mountain flood, there was no loss.
    In the Qixing Cooperative, we visited the newly built terraced fields and canals. This is an agricultural cooperative that has basically realized terracing and water conservancy. According to the director and Party branch secretary of the cooperative, more than 80% of the land here used to be slopes of forty to fifty degrees. In the past, there were only thirty-nine mu of paddy fields. Since the launch of the large-scale production movement last year, more than 80% of the slopes have been turned into terraced fields. In particular, this year, three consecutive advances were made in water conservancy, and a total of twenty-eight canals were built, irrigating more than eight hundred mu of land, and 85% of the cultivated land became paddy fields.
    In the struggle against nature, the cooperative members showed a moving heroic spirit. The cooperative built a terraced field last winter. In the middle of this field was a half-mu stone beach full of oddly shaped boulders, some as big as houses. On the right side of the slope was a large ditch more than two zhang deep and two zhang wide. To build this field, the stone beach had to be removed, the ditch filled, and a huge stone embankment built. Of course, there were many difficulties in such a project. The cooperative members said that no matter how difficult it was, they would build it!
    The Magou West Canal, which is currently under construction, is also a very arduous project. But the cooperative members did not retreat. Instead, they shouted the heroic slogan "No mountain is higher than the hoe, no stone is harder than the hammer." On the cliffs, the cooperative members almost crawled and knelt, using hammers to drill holes and set off cannons. Especially when they reached Shaling, the project became even more difficult. They had to blast open a 120-meter-long stone ridge here. The stone here was very hard. One hammer blow only made a white spot, and one cannon could only blast open a small stone kiln and collapse some white stone surfaces. Even such difficulties did not scare them. Every day, seven or eight people climbed Shaling to drill holes and set off cannons, and it took them eight days to blast open this stone ridge and build the canal on Shaling. Now, the main project of the West Canal is almost completed. There are still more than twenty canals to be built. These canals have to cross mountains and valleys, some have to blast away boulders as big as rooms, and some have to fill in mountain gullies more than thirty meters deep. However, although the project is so complex and difficult, it did not cost much money. The people's government only lent twenty-eight foreign hoes. The gunpowder was purchased by the cooperative itself, costing less than one hundred yuan.
    According to the Party branch secretary of the cooperative, the biggest difficulty in the construction process was the struggle against those stubborn and conservative ideas. People with this kind of thinking always emphasize difficulties and find various reasons to oppose the construction of terraced fields. They said, "If you want terraced fields on slopes, unless the sun rises in the west." This kind of thinking seriously affected everyone's enthusiasm. Without refuting this kind of thinking, construction would not be easy.
    The masses of Longwangmiao Township, like the members of the Qixing Cooperative, have exchanged their hard work for remarkable results. Terraced fields and water conservancy construction have already played a role, achieving "dividing large water into small water, and blocking rapid water into slow water," achieving the goal of "step-by-step control, section-by-section water storage, so that water does not leave the ditch, soil does not go down the slope, and both drought resistance and flood prevention." Since last year, this place, which has always been short of grain in history, has become a surplus grain township.
    Everywhere in Longwangmiao Township, you can see people engaged in sideline production activities. There are many ways to engage in sideline production here, including forestry (including timber, charcoal burning, orchards, etc.), animal husbandry, digging medicinal materials, hunting, and raising silkworms. This year, the sideline income of the whole township increased to more than 110,000 yuan, and the average income per person in the township was 25 yuan.
    Due to the rapid development of agriculture and sideline production in the township, income has increased compared with the past. In 1954, the average income per person was 33.5 yuan; this year, the average income per person in the township was 57.3 yuan. The average income of farmers in the township has exceeded the living standards of local wealthy middle peasants. In Longwangmiao Township, most of the villages have been replaced with new tiled houses, and the dilapidated thatched houses of the past have disappeared. According to statistics from the Qixing Cooperative, in recent years, the cooperative has added more than two hundred and sixty new tiled houses, and this winter, more than twenty farmers will build new houses.
    However, the people of Longwangmiao Township are not satisfied with their current lives. They have proposed to complete the tasks of terracing, water conservancy, and afforestation throughout the township next year.

    秦岭深山中的模范乡
    本报记者　朱波
    初冬，我们来到了陕西省商雒县的龙王庙乡。
    当我们刚刚翻过黄沙岭时，眼前就出现了一幅美丽的山区景色。满山满谷的森林，有的已经长大成材，有的还是幼小的树苗，其中有松、柏、桦、白杨、杨柳、栗子、柿子和核桃树，有的橙黄，有的鲜红……把这个山区打扮的万紫千红。一股一股的山泉，像是一条白色的飘带，从山上拖了下来，沿着山腰的水渠，流过层层叠叠的梯田，歌唱着向山谷流去。
    在这里，我们看到的已经不是过去的贫困的山区，而是幸福的乐园。但是，龙王庙乡的人民，并没有忘记那艰苦的过去，他们常常把那黑暗的岁月和今天的幸福时光作对比，用来教育自己和年青一代。
    过去的龙王庙乡是个偏僻而又贫困的山区。到处都是高耸的山峰和纵横的山谷。全乡一千零八十四户，共有耕地九千五百多亩，分散在近四十里地长的丛山中，而且大部分都是一镢捣着石头的薄瘠土地，一场大雨过后，就会把禾苗和泥土全部冲光，好年景每亩平均产量最多也只有一百斤，常常是一年收下的粮食还不够一季吃，因此，人们不得不常年为吃饭而奔波，有些农民就出去逃荒或讨饭，有人甚至一年内搬两三次家。当地农民形容这种生活是“春满堂，夏一半，秋冷落，冬不见”。就在这样困苦的生活里，土匪、地主还经常对农民进行抢夺和剥削。解放前，又曾遭蒋介石匪帮的劫掠。解放后，人们陆续回来了，人民政府帮助他们重新安家立业，但因土匪没有彻底肃清，地主也没有被斗垮，一直到1955年改造落后乡的工作时，才把压在人们心头上的石头搬掉。接着开展了互助合作运动，开始了以建设山区为重点的大生产运动。
    两年来，已经改变了山区的贫困面貌。在我们经过的地方，到处可以看到新修的层层梯田，很多股泉水被拦腰截断，引到水渠里。水土流失现象基本上被制止住了。过去每年发洪水时，总要冲垮很多良田和房屋，今年，这里曾遇到一场很大的山洪，但是却没有受到什么损失。
    在七星社里，我们参观了新修的梯田和水渠。这是一个基本上实现梯田化、水利化的农业社。据该社主任和党支部书记介绍，这里原来有80％以上的是四五十度的坡地。过去只有三十九亩水地，从去年开展大生产运动以来，已经有80％以上的坡地修成了梯田，特别是今年连续三次向水利进军，共修成了二十八条水渠，共浇地八百多亩，85％的耕地成了水地。
    在向大自然进行斗争中，社员们表现了令人感动的英雄气概。该社在去年冬季曾修过一块梯田，这块地中间有块半亩大的石滩，上边都是奇形怪状的巨石，有的像房子那么大。坡地的右边有一条二丈多深两丈宽的大沟。修这块地就要把这块石滩铲掉，把沟填平，并修筑一道巨大的石埝。这样一个工程困难当然是很多的，社员们说再困难也要修成它！
    目前正在施工的麻沟西渠也是非常艰巨的工程。但社员们并没有退缩，而是高呼着“山高没有镢头高，石硬没有锤头硬”的英雄口号。在悬崖陡壁上，社员们几乎是爬着、跪着用锤头打眼放炮，特别是当修到沙岭时，工程更加艰巨了，他们要在这里炸开一条一百二十公尺长的石岭，这里石质非常坚硬，一锤打下去，只打出一个白点，一炮只能炸开一个小石窑窑，崩掉一些白石面，就是这样困难也没有把他们吓倒，他们每天都有七、八个人，爬上沙岭打眼放炮，用了八天的时间把这个石岭炸开了，把水渠修上了沙岭。现在，西渠的主要工程已经快要完工了。还有二十多条水渠要修，这些水渠都要盘山越谷，有的要炸掉房间大的巨石，有的要填平三十多公尺深的山沟。但是，工程虽然这样复杂和困难，却并没有花费多少钱，人民政府只贷给了二十八件洋镐，火药是社筹资买的，共用了不到一百元。
    据该社支部书记说，建设过程中最大的困难要算是和那些顽固守旧的思想作斗争。有这种思想的人总是强调困难，找各种理由来反对修梯田，他们说“要想坡地有梯田，除非太阳出西山”。这种思想严重地影响了大家的热情，不驳倒这种思想，建设就不容易进行。
    龙王庙乡的群众就像七星社的社员们那样，用自己的辛勤劳动，换来了显著的成果。梯田、水利建设都已经发挥了作用，做到了“分大水为小水，拦猛水为缓水”，达到“步步控制，节节蓄水，使水不出沟，土不下坡，又抗旱又防涝”的目的。去年起，这个历史上一贯缺粮的地方，变成了余粮乡。
    在龙王庙乡到处可以看到搞副业生产活动的人。这里副业生产门路很多，有林业（又包括用材、烧木炭、果树等树林）、牧畜、挖药材、打猎、养蚕等。今年全乡副业收入增长到十一万元以上，全乡每人平均收入二十五元。
    由于该乡农业、副业发展较快，收入比过去增加了，1954年每人平均收入三十三元五角；今年全乡每人平均收入五十七元三角，全乡农户平均收入超过了当地富裕中农的生活水平。龙王庙乡各村，绝大部分都换成了新瓦房，过去那种破烂的草房已经绝迹了。据七星社统计，近几年来，全社共增加了二百六十多间新瓦房，今年冬季又有二十多户农民要盖新房。
    但是，龙王庙乡的人民对目前生活并没有感到满足，他们提出明年在全乡范围内完成梯田化、水利化和绿化的任务。
