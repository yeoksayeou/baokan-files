Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 3rd -- TASS reported from Moscow on November 2nd that the Soviet magazine "International Life" published Khrushchev's answers to questions from Denison, a reporter for the Canadian "Toronto Telegram," on issues such as disarmament, the Middle East situation, German reunification, and Soviet-Canadian trade relations.

Regarding the question of stopping nuclear weapons tests, Khrushchev said that as long as Western countries agree to undertake the obligation to cease nuclear weapons tests, the Soviet government is ready to sign an agreement to stop nuclear weapons tests at any time. The current level of scientific development allows for the supervision of the fulfillment of this obligation. If other countries believe that some form of additional supervision is required in the territory of the country conducting the tests, we are also willing to consider the conditions for establishing such supervision. Khrushchev emphasized that the responsibility for the long-delayed resolution of the issue of stopping nuclear weapons tests does not lie with the Soviet Union, but with Britain and the United States, which stubbornly refuse to conclude an agreement on this issue.

Khrushchev believes that the arms race should be stopped, and that reductions in armed forces and armaments should be undertaken, followed by a gradual establishment of supervision. Khrushchev said that the entire process of the United Nations Disarmament Subcommittee negotiations and other facts prove that Western countries are afraid of disarmament. The work of the subcommittee is fruitless, and secret discussions on disarmament issues cannot promote the smooth resolution of these issues. Khrushchev advocated the establishment of a permanent disarmament committee composed of all members of the United Nations, and advocated that disarmament negotiations be conducted in public. Khrushchev said that the abolition of foreign military bases on the territory of other countries is one of the important issues in resolving disarmament and easing international tensions. If Western countries really want to solve the disarmament problem and strive to ease international tensions, then they should abolish their military bases in other countries and withdraw their armed forces from there. Khrushchev said that even reducing the number of troops currently stationed at these military bases would be reasonable. If the United States and other Western countries abolish their military bases, then the Soviet Union and other peace-loving countries will immediately take further disarmament measures.

Khrushchev then pointed out that military bases in other countries no longer have the significance attributed to them by some overly boastful generals and activists with aggressive ambitions in Western countries. The development of intercontinental rockets has solved the problem of launching hydrogen bombs to any location on Earth.

Regarding the Middle East situation, Khrushchev said that we are deeply concerned and uneasy about the events taking place in the Middle East region. The imperialists are unwilling to accept the national independence and economic independence of the Arab people. When the people of Arab countries rise up against any form of political and economic enslavement, the imperialists say that there is a "communist threat" in those countries, use communism to intimidate, and begin to organize invasions in the way that they did in Guatemala. The United States is now using this method, preparing to invade Syria through Turkey. Therefore, the reason for the tension in the Middle East region is the interference of Western countries, primarily the United States, in the internal affairs of Arab countries.

Regarding the German issue, Khrushchev said that we have been and are in favor of restoring German reunification. However, in resolving this issue, the actual situation should be considered first. In fact, there are two German states with different socio-political systems. It is impossible to make any progress in the cause of restoring German reunification without acknowledging this fact. Only the Germans themselves, that is, the two Germanies, can promote the resolution of this issue through mutual negotiations. Ignoring the existence of two Germanies and attempting to resolve the issue of restoring German reunification without German participation means embarking on a path of violence, which will cause war disasters and may evolve into a new world war. The issue of restoring German reunification must be resolved peacefully.

When asked whether the danger of war is now less than it was a year or two ago, Khrushchev said that the conditions currently formed in the world do not foreshadow the outbreak of a new war in the near future. It can be said that the people of all countries are committed to peace, and the current situation is not a pre-war situation, that is, it is different from the situation before World War II. The governments of socialist countries are doing their utmost not only to prevent war, but also to eliminate tensions and create normal conditions for the two systems to compete on the basis of peaceful coexistence. Khrushchev said that we deny the statement that war is inevitable. However, it is also impossible to say absolutely that war will not happen. Everyone knows that in some capitalist countries there are still figures in high positions in the state who are calling for war. Can these madmen be trusted?

Regarding Canadian-Soviet trade relations, Khrushchev said that although the Soviet-Canadian trade agreement signed in February 1956 created favorable conditions for the development of mutually beneficial trade, trade relations between the two countries have not been fully developed. Khrushchev emphasized that Canada's discriminatory treatment of trade with the Soviet Union seriously hinders the development of trade. When asked whether he would agree to mutual visits with Canada's new Prime Minister Diefenbaker, Khrushchev said that we have always been in favor of mutual visits between national leaders, but such visits must be well prepared and help improve mutual understanding.

    就裁军、中东局势、德国统一等问题答加拿大记者问
    赫鲁晓夫斥美国干涉阿拉伯国家内政
    新华社3日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科2日讯，苏联“国际生活”杂志刊登了前些时候赫鲁晓夫就裁军、中东局势、德国统一、苏加贸易关系等问题答复加拿大“多伦多电讯报”记者戴米逊的谈话。
    赫鲁晓夫在回答有关停止试验核武器的问题时说，只要西方国家同意承担停止试验核武器的义务，苏联政府随时都愿意签订停止试验核武器的协议。目前科学发展的水平是能够监督这种义务的履行情况的。如果其他国家认为，在进行试验的国家境内须要另外建立某种监督的话，我们也愿意考虑建立这种监督的条件。赫鲁晓夫强调说，停止试验核武器的问题迟迟未获解决的责任不在苏联，而在英美，英美两国顽固地拒绝就这项问题缔结协定。
    赫鲁晓夫认为：应当停止军备竞赛，着手裁减武装部队和军备，然后进而逐步地建立监督。赫鲁晓夫说，联合国裁军小组委员会谈判的整个进程和其他事实，都证明西方国家害怕裁军。小组委员会的工作毫无结果，秘密讨论裁军问题不能够促进这些问题的顺利解决。赫鲁晓夫主张建立一个由联合国全体会员国组成的常设裁军委员会，并且主张裁军问题的谈判要在公开的情况下进行。赫鲁晓夫说，取消在别国领土上的外国军事基地是解决裁军和缓和国际紧张局势的重要问题之一。如果西方国家真想解决裁军问题、想争取缓和国际紧张局势的话，那末它们就应该取消在别国境内的军事基地，从那里撤出自己的武装部队。赫鲁晓夫说，即使是把现在驻扎在这些军事基地上的军队数量加以缩减也是合理的。如果美国和其他西方国家把自己的军事基地取消，那末，苏联和其他爱好和平的国家会马上采取进一步的裁军措施。
    赫鲁晓夫接着指出，在别国领土上的军事基地已经不再具有西方国家某些过度吹嘘的将军们和具有侵略野心的活动家们所赋予它的那种意义了。洲际火箭的制成解决了把氢弹发射到地球上任何地点去的可能性问题。
    关于中东局势，赫鲁晓夫说，我们对中东地区所发生的事件深感忧虑和不安。帝国主义者不甘心阿拉伯人民具有国家的独立和经济的独立。当阿拉伯国家的人民起来反对任何形式的政治和经济奴役的时候，帝国主义者就说在那些国家里存在有“共产主义威胁”，用共产主义进行恐吓，并且着手按照在危地马拉所用过的方法来组织进犯。美国现在所用的就是这种方法，它准备假手土耳其来进犯叙利亚。因此，造成中东地区紧张局势的原因就是西方国家，首先是美国干涉阿拉伯国家的内政。
    关于德国问题，赫鲁晓夫说，我们过去和现在都赞成恢复德国统一。但是在解决这个问题的时候，首先应当考虑现实的情况。事实上，德国存在有两个具有不同社会政治制度的国家。不承认这个事实，就不可能在恢复德国统一的事业中获得任何进展。只有德国人自己、也就是两个德国互相进行谈判，才能推动这个问题的解决。无视存在两个德国的事实和企图不要德国参加来解决恢复德国统一的问题，就意味着走上采取暴力的道路，就会造成战争的灾难，可能演变成新的世界大战。恢复德国统一的问题必须采取和平的方式解决。
    在回答目前发生战争的危险性是否小于一两年前的问题的时候，赫鲁晓夫说，目前世界上形成的条件不预示最近会爆发新战争。可以说，各国人民是致力于和平的，目前的局势不是战前的局势，也就是说，不同于第二次世界大战以前的局势。社会主义国家的政府竭尽全力，不仅为了不发生战争，而且也为了消除紧张局势和创造两个制度在和平共处的基础上展开竞赛的正常条件。赫鲁晓夫说，我们否认战争是注定不可避免的说法。但是，绝对地说战争不会发生也是不行的。大家知道，在某些资本主义国家里还有一些身居国家高位的人物在号召战争。难道能够信赖这些疯子吗？
    关于加拿大和苏联贸易关系，赫鲁晓夫说，虽然1956年2月签订的苏加贸易协定给发展互利的贸易创造了有利条件，但是两国之间的贸易关系还没有得到充分的发展。赫鲁晓夫强调说，加拿大保留对苏联贸易的歧视严重地阻碍着贸易的发展。赫鲁晓夫在回答是否同意同加拿大新总理迪芬贝克互相访问的问题时说，我们一贯赞成国家领导人互相访问，但是这种访问必须很好地准备和有助于改善相互谅解。
