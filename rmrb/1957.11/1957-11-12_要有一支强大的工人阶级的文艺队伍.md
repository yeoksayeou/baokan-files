    The struggle against the rightists in literary and art circles has achieved a great victory, bringing a fresh atmosphere to the literary and art scene. The broad masses of literary and art workers have received tremendous education and training in this historically significant struggle. We have conducted and will continue to conduct a struggle with the rightists in literary and art circles. This struggle is to defend the socialist line in literature and art and to prevent the rightists from leading literature and art onto the bourgeois path. However, defeating the rightists only clears the obstacles for the development of socialist literature and art, and does not completely solve the problem of establishing and developing socialist literature and art. To establish and develop socialist literature and art, a series of correct measures must be taken, and the most fundamental is that there must be a strong and truly working-class literary and art contingent.
    What is the situation of our literary and art contingent? The contingent of literary and art workers is large, and the vast majority of them support the leadership of the Party and are willing to take the socialist road. However, this anti-rightist struggle has also clearly exposed the weaknesses of this contingent. Our literary and art contingent is composed of the following people: Some were revolutionary or progressive literary and art workers before liberation. They had long been engaged in revolutionary literary and art work in revolutionary base areas or Kuomintang-controlled areas. They are the backbone and core of our literary and art contingent, and have made many efforts and contributions to the development of socialist literature and art. However, even among them, some have still not thoroughly changed their original bourgeois world outlook, have not completely abandoned their bourgeois individualism and habits, and have gradually degenerated and deteriorated under the new circumstances, finally falling into the ranks of bourgeois rightists. Some were originally bourgeois literary and art workers. After liberation, through ideological remolding and multiple ideological criticism movements, most are willing to follow the people on the socialist road; some have even accepted Marxism-Leninism; but there are also some who still adhere to their bourgeois reactionary stance and hold a hostile attitude towards the Party and socialist cause. Another part is young literary and art workers who have been trained in the new society after liberation. Most of them are good and are reliable successors to our literary and art cause. But it is heartbreaking that many rightists and anti-Party elements have also emerged among them. This situation cannot but arouse our serious vigilance. Obviously, our literary and art contingent is still very unsound and cannot be said to have become a truly working-class literary and art contingent.
    It must be pointed out that the phenomenon of the literary and art circles being divorced from the masses is quite serious. Many writers are divorced from the working masses, from the lives and struggles of workers and peasants. And when separated from the working people, bourgeois individualism, liberalism, and other ideas will inevitably grow; and this has become a major obstacle to the progress of the literary and art contingent and a hotbed for cultivating rightists among them. In order to develop socialist literature and art, there must be a truly working-class literary and art contingent that has completely rid itself of the ideological influence of the bourgeoisie, and the only way to build such a contingent is to closely integrate literary and art workers with the workers and peasants. They should always live among the masses, and should participate in production struggles and class struggles together with the masses. This is what Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out long ago in his "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art": Literary and art workers "must integrate with the new masses," "must go to the masses, must go to the workers, peasants, and soldiers for a long time, unconditionally, and wholeheartedly, and go to the heat of the struggle." Only in this way can literary and art workers thoroughly transform their thinking, make themselves loyal fighters of the working class, and become outstanding singers of the working people.
    During the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation, many literary and art workers in the revolutionary base areas responded to the call of the Party and went to the countryside, factories, and troops in large numbers to practice the policy of integrating with the masses. They were tempered among the masses, and produced a number of excellent works full of new life, giving our literature and art a new look. After liberation, some people continued to live among the masses. Some of them actively participated in various social transformation movements, and some have been living in factories and rural areas. They have a serious and earnest attitude towards the cause of the people and their own creations, and therefore have achieved better results. Some people had to stay in the city due to work needs. However, many other people were simply attached to the life in big cities. They left the workers and peasants, and only occasionally went to the countryside and factories for a fleeting glimpse, making it impossible to truly understand the life and struggle in factories and rural areas. Their thoughts and feelings became increasingly estranged from the workers and peasants. As a result, either they could not write anything at all, or they wrote some superficial works that impoverished life, or they distorted reality and wrote things that slandered the people and defamed the socialist system.
    The slogan "experience life" used to be popular in literary and art circles. This slogan was good for some old writers who did not have the opportunity to contact the workers and peasants under the reactionary rule in the past, so that they could make up for the lesson and get closer to the workers and peasants to some extent. For today's writers, especially young writers, who can live among the masses, this slogan is far from enough and may even have a bad effect. "Experiencing life" is short-term, occasional, and specifically for the purpose of collecting creative materials. That is to say, the writer is not living with the masses as a member of the masses, sharing their joys and sorrows, but only occasionally visiting them as a guest. This is vastly different from the spirit of "going to the workers, peasants, and soldiers for a long time, unconditionally, and wholeheartedly." Truly reflecting the vivid deeds of the working masses in socialist construction is the fundamental task of our literature and art. Writers and artists can only realize this task by directly participating in the socialist transformation and construction movement. Therefore, our writers, except for those who are old and frail, or who hold positions in state organs or literary organizations and cannot stay for a long time, should generally go to factories, rural areas, or other grassroots units to take on certain practical work and appropriately participate in productive labor. Young writers must do this without exception. They have little experience in life and creation, and should not be professionalized too early. In the past, some places adopted the method of "raising flowers in a greenhouse" to separate some young authors from practical work and make them "professional writers." This practice was wrong. We should pay special attention to cultivating writers and artists from the workers and peasants, especially from young workers and peasants who have culture and talent; but in the past, some places inappropriately transferred workers and peasants who had just written one or two works away from their jobs to professionalize them, or forcibly touted some workers and peasants who did not yet have basic cultural knowledge as "writers." This practice was also wrong. Painters, composers, various artistic performers, theorists, critics, and researchers also need to adopt appropriate methods, according to the nature of their business, to frequently go to the grassroots masses to participate in practical work and physical labor. The long-term combination of literary and art workers with the workers and peasants in labor and struggle should become the fundamental system of our literary and art work.
    At present, there are relatively more writers concentrated in Beijing and Shanghai, and some of them should be appropriately dispersed to various provinces and cities. Many writers have certain historical connections with a certain place. Their going there is not only conducive to their in-depth understanding of the life of the masses, but also conducive to the development of the local literary and art movement. The people and Party and government leaders in various places welcome writers to go. Dozens of writers in Beijing have decided to go to various places for a long time or a relatively long time to go deep into factories and rural areas to participate in grassroots work. This is a very good thing. It is hoped that writers across the country can do the same. Some writers who stay in big cities should also establish certain connections with nearby factories or suburban rural areas, and participate in some practical work as much as possible. All Party member writers should be incorporated into the grassroots Party organizations where they work or the street branches where they live to participate in organizational life. Writers should not only be close to other writers, but should also make friends with workers and peasants.
    It should be seen that there are difficulties for writers to go to the grassroots to participate in work and labor. Life below is of course more difficult than life in big cities. In addition to doing their own practical work well, writers who go down also need to observe life, study life, and constantly accumulate materials for literary writing in many ways. This is an arduous task. However, literary creation is originally a difficult undertaking, and it is necessary to pay a great deal of labor to achieve certain achievements. All ambitious writers will be able to overcome those difficulties and resolutely take this correct road. At the same time, the Writers Association and its branches in various places should do their best to help the writers who go down to solve various difficulties. Detailed arrangements should be made according to the specific circumstances of each writer, so that they can all be put in their proper places below. After they go down, writers' organizations should establish regular contact with them and provide them with all possible assistance in their creation and learning. Party organizations at all levels should also care more about them, especially giving them regular guidance and assistance in politics and ideology.
    To build a strong and truly working-class literary and art contingent is our current major historical task. And to build such a contingent, there is no other way than to implement the integration of literary and art workers with the workers and peasants and to cultivate new writers from the workers and peasants. We must resolutely implement this policy. We believe that the broad masses of literary and art workers will also support this policy, respond to the call of the Party, go to the workers and peasants for a long time, unconditionally, and wholeheartedly, temper themselves, transform themselves, and at the same time obtain rich creative sources and profound artistic feelings from the life of the people, and write many artistic works worthy of this great era. In this way, our socialist literature and art will reach a higher stage of prosperity. This is foreseeable.

### 要有一支强大的工人阶级的文艺队伍

    要有一支强大的工人阶级的文艺队伍
    文艺界反右派的斗争，已经取得很大的胜利，使文艺界气象一新。广大文艺工作者在这场有历史意义的斗争中受到了极大的教育和锻炼。我们和文艺界的右派分子进行了并且还要继续进行斗争，这个斗争是为了保卫社会主义的文艺路线，不让右派分子把文艺引到资产阶级的道路上去。但是，击溃了右派只是为发展社会主义文艺扫清了障碍，还不等于彻底解决了建立和发展社会主义的文艺的问题。要建立和发展社会主义的文艺，必须采取一系列正确的措施，而最根本的就是必须有一支坚强的真正工人阶级的文艺队伍。
    我们的文艺队伍的情况怎样呢？文艺工作者的队伍很大，他们绝大多数是拥护党的领导，愿意走社会主义的道路的。但是，经过这次反右派斗争也明显地暴露了这支队伍的弱点。我们的文艺队伍是由这样一些人组成的：一部分在解放前就是革命的或进步的文艺家，他们曾经在革命根据地或国民党统治区长期从事革命的文艺工作，他们是我们的文艺队伍的骨干和核心，对于发展社会主义文艺，曾经作了很多的努力，并有贡献。但是，就在他们中间也有一些人仍然没有彻底改变他们原来的资产阶级世界观，没有彻底抛弃他们的资产阶级个人主义的思想和习惯，以致在新的情况下逐渐蜕化、变质，终于堕落成为资产阶级右派。一部分是本来属于资产阶级的文艺家，在解放后，经过思想改造和多次的思想批判运动，大多愿意跟着人民走社会主义道路；有些人且已接受了马克思列宁主义思想；但也有一些人还是坚持他们的资产阶级的反动立场，对党和社会主义事业抱着仇视的态度。另一部分是在解放后的新社会里培养出来的青年文艺工作者。他们大多是好的，是我们的文艺事业的可以依靠的接班人。但令人痛心的，是他们中间也出现了不少右派分子和反党分子。这种情况，不能不引起我们的严重警惕。很明显，我们的文艺队伍还是很不健全，还不能说已经成为真正工人阶级的文艺队伍。
    必须指出，文艺界脱离群众的现象是相当严重的。许多作家脱离了劳动群众，脱离了工人和农民的生活和斗争。而脱离了劳动人民，资产阶级个人主义、自由主义等等思想就必然会滋长；而这就成了文艺队伍前进的重大障碍和在他们中间培植右派的温床。为了发展社会主义文艺，必须有一支彻底摆脱了资产阶级的思想影响的真正工人阶级的文艺队伍，而建立这样一支队伍的唯一途径，就是要使文艺工作者和工农群众密切结合，他们应该永远生活在群众之中，应该和群众一起参加生产斗争和阶级斗争。这就是毛泽东同志“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”中所早已指出的：文艺家“必须和新的群众相结合”，“必须到群众中去，必须长期地无条件地全心全意地到工农兵群众中去，到火热的斗争中去”。只有这样，文艺工作者才能彻底改造自己的思想，使自己成为工人阶级的忠实战士，成为劳动人民的出色的歌手。
    在抗日战争和解放战争中，革命根据地的许多文艺工作者曾经响应党的号召，大批到农村、工厂、部队中去，实践了和群众相结合的方针，他们在群众中受到了锻炼，并且产生了一批充满新的生活气息的优秀的作品，使我们的文艺面目一新。解放后，有些人还是继续坚持生活在群众中，他们有的曾积极参加各种社会改造运动，有的一直住在工厂、农村，他们对人民的事业和自己的创作都抱着严肃认真的态度，因此也有较好的成绩。有些人则因为工作的需要不得不留在城市里面。但是，另外有不少人却只是留恋大城市里的生活，他们离开了工农群众，偶尔下乡下厂，也只是走马观花，不可能真正了解工厂农村中的生活和斗争，他们的思想感情也和工农群众日益疏远，结果是或者根本写不出东西，或者写出一些肤浅的把生活贫乏化的作品，再不然就是歪曲现实，写出一些污蔑人民、诽谤社会主义制度的东西。
    文艺界曾经流行过“体验生活”的口号。这个口号，对于过去在反动统治下没有机会去接触工农群众的一些老作家来说是有好处的，可以使他们补一补课，多少接近一下工农群众。对于今天本来可以生活在群众中的作家特别是青年作家来说，这个口号就十分不够甚至会起坏作用了。“体验生活”是短期的，偶一为之的，是专门为了搜集创作材料而去的。这就是说，作家并不是作为群众中的一分子，和他们生活在一起，同甘共苦，而只是偶然地到他们中间去作客。这和“长期地无条件地全心全意地到工农兵群众中去”的精神，是有天壤之别的。真实地反映劳动群众在社会主义建设中的生动事迹，是我们的文学艺术的根本任务。作家、艺术家只有直接参加社会主义的改造和建设运动，才有可能实现这个任务。因此，我们的作家，除了年老体弱，或在国家机关、文学团体中担任了职务，不可能长期下去的以外，一般地都应当到工厂、农村或其他基层单位去，担任一定的实际工作，并且适当地参加生产劳动。青年作家更必须无例外地这样做。他们生活经验和创作经验都很少，不应当过早地专业化。过去有些地方采用“温室养花”的办法使一些青年作者脱离实际工作而去当“专业作家”，这种作法是错误的。我们应当特别注意从工农群众中，特别是有文化有天才的青年工人农民中去培养作家艺术家；但是过去有些地方把刚写过一两篇作品的工农作者不适当地调离工作岗位，使之专业化，或者把一些还没有具备基础文化知识的工农写作者勉强地吹捧成“作家”，这种作法也是错误的。画家、作曲家、各种艺术表演家、理论批评家和研究家，也需要根据他们的业务性质，采用适当的方式，经常到基层群众中去，参加实际工作和体力劳动。文艺工作者在劳动中、斗争中和工农群众长期地相结合，应当成为我们文艺工作的根本制度。
    目前集中在北京、上海的作家比较多，应该适当地分散一部分到各省市去。许多作家都和某一个地方有一定的历史联系，他们到那里去，不但有利于他们深入群众生活，而且也有利于发展当地的文艺运动。各地的人民和党政负责人很欢迎作家们去。北京的几十位作家已经决定到各地长期或比较长期地深入工厂农村，参加基层工作，这是一件很好的事情。希望全国的作家都能够这样做。一部分留在大城市的作家，也应当和附近的工厂或郊区农村建立一定的联系，尽可能参加一些实际工作。所有党员作家都应当编到他们担任工作的基层党组织或他们居住所在的街道支部中去过组织生活。作家不应该只同作家接近，而应该到工人农民中间去交朋友。
    应当看到，作家们到基层去参加工作和劳动，并不是毫无困难的。下面的生活，当然比大城市的生活要艰苦一些。下去的作家除了做好自己担负的实际工作以外，还要多方面地观察生活，研究生活，还要不断地积累文学写作的资料，这是一项繁重的工作。但是，文学创作本来就是一件艰苦的事业，必须付出巨大的劳动，才可能达到一定的成就。一切有志气的作家，是一定能够克服那些困难，坚决地走这条正确的道路的。同时，作家协会和它在各地的分会，应当尽力帮助下去的作家们解决各种困难。应当根据每个作家的具体情况，进行细致的安排，使他们到下面去各得其所。在他们下去以后，作家团体应当和他们建立经常的联系，对他们的创作和学习给以各种可能的帮助。各级党组织，也应当更多地关心他们，特别是在政治上思想上经常地给以指导和帮助。
    建立一支强大的真正工人阶级的文艺队伍，是我们当前重大的历史任务。而要建立这样一个队伍，除了实行文艺工作者和工农群众相结合并从工农群众中培养新作家以外，再没有任何其他的道路。我们必须坚决地实行这个方针。我们相信，广大的文艺工作者也会拥护这个方针，响应党的号召，长期地、无条件地、全心全意地到工农群众中去，锻炼自己，改造自己，同时从人民生活中取得丰富的创作源泉和深刻的艺术感受，写出许多无愧于这个伟大时代的艺术作品。这样，我们的社会主义文艺，就会达到一个更高的繁荣的阶段。这是可以预期的。
