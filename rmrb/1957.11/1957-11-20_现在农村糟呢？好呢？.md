Is the Countryside Now Terrible? Or Good?

Shi Huiyun, female worker at Beijing State-owned No. 2 Cotton Mill

Some people say the rural cadres are no good, and even if there are good cadres, they are suppressed by the bad ones. I think most of the village cadres are good and are earnestly serving the people. Only a few village cadres have shortcomings. However, some farmers are selfish and have serious ideas about private ownership. Take my maternal grandmother's family as an example. They clearly have enough food to eat, but they still demand more grain. The village cadre said straightforwardly, "You have enough to eat, we cannot increase it." They then said the village cadre was bureaucratic and didn't care about the lives of the farmers. But later, my grandmother came to my house and brought us several pounds of good rice. I asked my mother where the grain came from. My mother said, "Your grandmother's family gave it to us!" I said, "Didn't my grandmother's family say they didn't have enough to eat?" My mother said, "That's just what she wants to say."

Some people say the current cooperatives are getting worse and worse. I think this is unfounded. Take my family as an example. In the past, when my family was middle peasant, my father and my uncle both worked in Beijing and often sent money home. It is said that life was very good. But at that time, we still ate sweet potato leaves (yam leaves) and sorghum flour pancakes. Now farmers eat grain, and they can eat white flour during the New Year and other holidays. Does that mean life is getting worse? What are people wearing in the countryside now? There is fancy serge and gabardine. What are they eating? They are eating until their faces are rosy.

Some people say that the rural life and the workers' life are too far apart. I don't think they are too far apart. We should compare the living conditions. In the countryside, one person can eat for five yuan a month, but in the city, an average person needs more than ten yuan a month. Some farmers, with one labor force in the family, support five or six people, and life is relatively difficult; but some workers in the city, with one person working to support five or six people, also have a difficult life. To compare living standards, we cannot compare a farmer supporting several family members with a worker who has no family burdens.

### 现在农村糟呢？好呢？

    现在农村糟呢？好呢？
    北京国棉二厂女工　施慧云
    有人说农村干部不好，就是有好的干部也被坏干部压倒了。我认为村干部大部分都是好的，是认真为人民服务的。只有个别的村干部是有缺点。但是有的农民自私自利和个人私有观念严重，就拿我姥姥家来说吧，明明粮食够吃，还叫喊要增加粮食。村干部很直爽的说，够吃的，不能增加。他们就说村干部官僚主义，不关心农民生活。可是以后我姥姥到我家来，给我们带来几斤的好大米。我问我母亲这粮食由哪里来的？我母亲说，是你姥姥家给拿来的！我说，我姥姥家不是说粮食不够吃吗？我母亲说，她就要这样喊。
    有人说现在的合作社越搞越糟了，我认为这样说是没有根据的。就拿我们家来说吧，过去，我家是中农的时候，我父亲和我叔父他们都在北京作事，经常往家寄钱。按说，生活是过得很好的。可是我们那时还吃白薯叶（地瓜叶）和高粮面作成的饼子。现在农民吃的是粮食，过年过节都能吃上白面了。难道说，这是生活越来越低了吗？现在农村穿的是什么？有花哔叽和华达呢，吃的，也是吃的满脸红红的。
    有人说，农村生活和工人生活相差太远。我认为相差不太远。我们应该拿生活条件来比一下，在农村一个人一个月吃饭五元就可以了，可是城市平均一个人一个月十元还不够。有的农民，一家人一个劳动力，养五、六口人，生活是比较困难点；可是城市里有的工人，一个人做工养五、六口人，他的生活也是困难的。要比生活水平，我们不能拿一个农民养着几口人的人家和一个没有家庭等负担的工人相比。
