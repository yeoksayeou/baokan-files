Xinhua News Agency, 2nd -- The Central Committee of the China Democratic League held its tenth enlarged rectification forum on the afternoon of October 29th to expose and criticize the reactionary words and deeds of Ye Duyi, a loyal follower of the Zhang-Luo alliance.

According to revelations at the meeting, as early as when the rightist Ye Duyi was studying at Yenching University from 1930 to 1934, he was the adopted son of John Leighton Stuart, a close friend of American agent Fu Jingbo, and a prized student of Zhang Dongsun, who was known for his anti-communism. In 1938, he and Zhang Dongsun went to Hankou, plotting to promote the so-called "Sino-Japanese Reconciliation" and surrender to Japanese imperialism. Ye Duyi's reactionary twenty-year history began with engaging in traitorous activities.

In 1946, Ye Duyi became a liaison between the State Socialist Party leader Zhang Junmai, Luo Longji, and others, and American imperialist elements. He served as Zhang Junmai's personal English secretary. In addition to acting as an interpreter for Zhang Junmai's meetings with Marshall and John Leighton Stuart and selling out information of the Democratic League, he also accepted instructions from American imperialism to engage in a third force to confront the Chinese Communist Party. Moreover, he drafted letters and translated the draft constitution of the Old Political Consultative Conference for Zhang Junmai. According to Ye Duyi, Zhang Junmai later secretly transferred these letters and draft constitution translations to Truman to curry favor with American imperialists.

Ye Duyi admitted that he was the "democratic individualist" expected by American imperialists. He confessed: "From following Zhang Junmai to following Luo Longji, I followed a pro-American line in foreign relations and a middle line on domestic issues, advocating a bourgeois democratic system." He admitted that he was a "sympathizer" in terms of the ideas of Zhang Junmai and Luo Longji, and an "active participant and executor" of their conspiracies.

After liberation, the Communist Party and the people did not hold past transgressions against Ye Duyi and gave him a high political position, but he never abandoned his anti-communist and anti-socialist stance. From 1949 onwards, he participated in the Luo Longji anti-communist group, including Zhang Dongsun, becoming a core member of this group. After the formation of the Zhang-Luo alliance in 1956, Ye Duyi served as a liaison between Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji, becoming their loyal follower and vigorously promoting the Zhang-Luo alliance's political line of attacking the Communist Party.

During the period of great contending and blooming in the first stage of rectification, Ye Duyi fired two poisonous arrows at a forum of the United Front Work Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China: First, he clamored for the Communist Party to withdraw from government organs, schools, and enterprises. He said, "It is not appropriate to emphasize party affiliation in government organs, schools, and enterprises, and it is not appropriate to emphasize the role of party organizations, including the Communist Party of China." He believed that "one more layer of party affiliation creates one more opportunity for conflict and creates a wall between the Party and the masses." Ye Duyi's second poisonous arrow was to organize an intellectual party. He said: "The Democratic League, the CAPD, the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, and the Jiusan Society are all parties that unite intellectuals from different fields. From the perspective of uniting five million intellectuals, I suggest disbanding these four parties and forming another intellectual party." Many facts have now shown that Ye Duyi's poisonous arrow was fired to realize the Zhang-Luo alliance's conspiracy to control intellectuals as a means of attacking the Communist Party. Ye Duyi admitted in his confession, "I completely became a docile servant of these two careerists."

At the meeting, Ma Zhengxin, who had worked with Ye Duyi, revealed Ye Duyi's conspiratorial activities in the National Committee of the CPPCC, using his position as Deputy Secretary-General. Ma Zhengxin said that the Zhang-Luo alliance, misappropriating the name of the Central Committee of the Democratic League, proposed the establishment of a so-called "Committee on Advanced Intellectuals" to the National Committee of the CPPCC, attempting to usurp the Communist Party's leadership over intellectuals through this committee. Ye Duyi echoed Zhang Bojun, saying, "If we're going to do it, let's do it big. Not only should the National Committee of the CPPCC establish a Committee on Intellectuals, but also each province and city should establish one, and this should continue down the line so that the appeal is great."

After Ye Duyi participated in the work of receiving foreign guests of the CPPCC, he did his best to help Luo Longji realize his conspiracy to occupy the international issues group of the CPPCC in order to establish direct external contact.

Zhang Bojun attempted to turn the National Committee of the CPPCC into an upper house of the bourgeoisie and implement a capitalist bicameral system. Ye Duyi actively supported him in the CPPCC. Ye Duyi said: "I propose that the National People's Congress have a certain committee, and the CPPCC also have a certain committee. On the same issue, the committee of the NPC discusses it, and the committee of the CPPCC also discusses it. The bicameral system in capitalist countries is that one is facing the other, the upper house has a certain committee, and the lower house also has a certain committee."

Ye Duyi also participated in the four working groups of the Zhang-Luo alliance's conspiracy to attack the Communist Party and the reactionary activities such as the Six Professors Meeting convened by Zhang Bojun on June 6. In addition, Ye Duyi also used his position as Deputy Secretary-General and Director of the General Office of the Central Committee of the Democratic League to compile and print "Brief Reports on the Work of the Central Committee of the Democratic League" to peddle the private goods of the Zhang-Luo alliance.

Ye Duyi made a light-hearted confession of his sinister activities at the meeting, and everyone believed that his attitude was not honest. Chu Tunan, a member of the Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the Democratic League who presided over the meeting, warned Ye Duyi to thoroughly confess his crimes and the reactionary activities of the Zhang-Luo alliance and not to isolate himself from the people.

Zhang Manjun, Song An, Xue Bomin, Lü Guangguang, Xin Zhichao, Qian Jiaju, and others also exposed Ye Duyi at the meeting.

    向日美帝国主义献媚　替好多反共头目效忠
    叶笃义二十年来一贯反动
    民盟中央整风座谈会揭露和批判了他的罪恶言行
    新华社2日讯　中国民主同盟中央10月29日下午举行第十次整风扩大座谈会，揭露和批判章罗联盟的忠实走卒叶笃义的反动言行。
    据会上揭露，右派分子叶笃义远在1930年到1934年燕京大学读书的时候，就是司徒雷登的干儿子，是美国特务傅泾波的密友，又是以反共著称的张东荪的得意学生。1938年，他同张东荪到汉口，阴谋促成所谓“中日媾和”，向日本帝国主义投降，叶笃义反动的二十年历史，就是从进行汉奸活动开始的。
    1946年，叶笃义成为国社党头子张君劢、罗隆基等人与美帝国主义分子勾结的牵线人。他充当了张君劢的私人英文秘书。他除了为张君劢会见马歇尔、司徒雷登当翻译，出卖民盟的情报外，还接受了美帝国主义的指示，搞第三势力，与中共对抗。不仅如此，他还为张君劢起草信件和旧政协宪草译稿。据叶笃义说，张君劢后来把这些信件和宪草译稿秘密转给杜鲁门，向美帝国主义者献媚。
    叶笃义承认他是美帝国主义者所期望的“民主个人主义者”。他交代说：“我由追随张君劢到追随罗隆基，在对外关系上走亲美路线，在国内问题上走中间路线，主张资产阶级民主制度。”他承认他是张君劢、罗隆基思想上的“共鸣者”，是进行阴谋活动的“积极参加者和执行者”。
    解放后，共产党和人民不咎既往，给了叶笃义很高的政治地位，但他一直没有放弃反共、反社会主义的立场。从1949年起，他就参加了包括张东荪在内的罗隆基反共集团，成为这个集团的核心分子。1956年，章罗联盟形成以后，叶笃义又充当了章伯钧、罗隆基之间的联络员，成为他们的忠实走卒，大肆宣扬章罗联盟向共产党进攻的政治路线。
    叶笃义在整风第一阶段大鸣大放时期，曾经在中共中央统战部座谈会上放出两支毒箭：首先，他叫嚣要共产党退出机关、学校和企业。他说：“在机关、学校和企业中不宜强调党派关系，不宜强调包括中共在内的党派组织的作用。”他认为，“多一层党派关系就多一个产生矛盾的机会，就有了党群关系之间的墙。”叶笃义的第二支毒箭是要组织一个知识分子政党。他说：“民盟、民进、农工、九三这四个党派，都是团结不同方面的知识分子的党派，从团结五百万知识分子着眼，建议把这四个党派解散，另组一个知识分子政党。”现在已经有许多事实表明，叶笃义的这支毒箭是为了实现章罗联盟控制知识分子作为向共产党进攻的阴谋而放射的。叶笃义在交代中承认“我完全变成这两个野心家的驯顺仆从了”。
    会上，曾经同叶笃义一起工作的马正信揭露了叶笃义在政协全国委员会利用副秘书长职务进行阴谋活动的事实。马正信说，章罗联盟盗用民盟中央的名义，向政协全国委员会提出了设立所谓“高级知识分子问题委员会”的建议，企图通过这个委员会来篡夺共产党对知识分子的领导。叶笃义跟着章伯钧一唱一和地说：“要搞就大搞，不但政协全国委员会要成立知识分子问题委员会，各省、市也要成立，就这样一直线下去，号召作用才大。”
    叶笃义参加了政协外宾接待工作以后，竭力帮助罗隆基实现霸占政协国际问题组以建立对外直接联系的阴谋。
    章伯钧企图把政协全国委员会变为资产阶级的上议院，实行资本主义的两院制，叶笃义在政协曾积极为他帮腔。叶笃义说：“我主张全国人民代表大会有一个什么委员会，政协也有一个什么委员会，同一个问题，人大的委员会讨论，政协的委员会也讨论。资本主义国家的两院制就是一个一个地对着的，上院有一个什么委员会，下院也有一个什么委员会。”
    叶笃义还参与了章罗联盟阴谋向共产党进攻的四个工作组以及章伯钧6月6日召集的六教授会议等反动活动。此外，叶笃义还利用民盟中央副秘书长兼办公厅主任的职务编印“民盟中央工作简报”，贩卖章罗联盟的私货。
    叶笃义在会上避重就轻地交代了他的罪恶活动，大家认为他的态度很不老实。主持会议的民盟中常委楚图南警告叶笃义，要他彻底交代自己的罪行和章罗联盟的反动活动，不要自绝于人民。
    会上揭露叶笃义的还有张曼筠、宋安、薛博民、吕光光、辛志超和千家驹等人。
