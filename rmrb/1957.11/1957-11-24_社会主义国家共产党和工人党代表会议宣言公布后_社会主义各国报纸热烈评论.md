Xinhua News Agency, November 23rd - After the publication of the Declaration of the Meeting of Representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of Socialist Countries, "Neues Deutschland," "Berliner Zeitung," "Tribune," and "Young World" in the German Democratic Republic all carried the full text of the Declaration. Other newspapers published summaries. The "Sächsische Zeitung," published in Dresden, also carried and published commentaries.

    "Berliner Zeitung" had the headline "The Victory of Socialism is Inevitable Throughout the World." The newspaper wrote that the Communist and Workers' Parties, while uniting their ranks and striving for the unity of the working class and the people of all countries, unhesitatingly overcome all obstacles in their path and will achieve new and brilliant victories in the struggle for world peace, democracy, and socialism.

    "Tribune" said that the Communist and Workers' Parties of socialist countries should adhere to the principle of combining the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the specific practice of revolution and construction in each country, creatively apply the common laws of socialist revolution and socialist construction in accordance with the specific conditions of each country, and learn from and exchange experiences with each other.

    The German News Agency reported many talks by representatives of all strata of the Republic's people, who warmly welcomed the publication of the communiqué and emphasized its great significance, believing that this document embodies the power of the peace camp and reflects firm confidence in the victory of socialism.

    Xinhua News Agency, November 23rd - All newspapers in Bulgaria carried the full text of the Declaration of the Meeting of Representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of Socialist Countries on the 22nd. "Rabotnichesko Delo" and "Zemedelsko Zname" both published editorials.

    "Rabotnichesko Delo" pointed out that the leading force of socialist countries is their long-tested Marxist-Leninist party. For the benefit of their own people and for the sake of peace and socialism, socialist countries constantly strengthen their unity and friendly cooperation. The Declaration of the Meeting of Representatives is another brilliant manifestation of this unity among socialist countries and their complete agreement on the current international situation and some issues in the international communist movement. It is a document of great significance. The strength of the socialist camp lies in its unbreakable unity. This unity is based on the invincible ideology of Marxism-Leninism and the principles of socialist internationalism. The editorial continued, saying that the Bulgarian people stand firmly in the socialist camp, are an inseparable part of it, and have a flesh-and-blood connection with it, sharing life and death. The Bulgarian people safeguard the unity of this camp like the apple of their eye and strengthen friendship with the Soviet Union and other socialist countries.

    Xinhua News Agency, Prague, November 23rd - Czechoslovakia's "Rudé Právo" and other central-level newspapers all carried the Declaration of the Meeting of Representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of Socialist Countries on the 22nd.

    "Rudé Právo" published an editorial on this declaration on the 23rd.

    The editorial said that the Declaration of the Meeting of Representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of Socialist Countries attaches great importance to the issue of the international situation and the struggle for peace. The development of the world today is determined by the process and outcome of the competition between two opposing social systems. In this competition, socialism has clearly demonstrated its tremendous superiority and strong vitality. Capitalism is irretrievably approaching its demise. The imperialists have no other way out of their predicament except to prepare for war. In this regard, the American aggressive bloc plays a special role, being the world center of reaction in our era and the most vicious enemy of the masses. The struggle against plans to launch a new war and the struggle against German militarism, which threatens the people of all Europe, is our primary task.

    The editorial then wrote that the declaration signed by the representatives of the Communist and Workers' Parties of socialist countries shows that there is complete agreement and mutual understanding on all issues concerning the mutual relations of these parties.

    The editorial emphasized that the Soviet Union, the first victorious socialist country, is the core of the entire socialist camp, and that closely uniting around the Soviet Union is the foundation of the unity of socialist countries.

    The editorial pointed out that the Czechoslovak party sees revisionism as the main danger to the communist movement. Of course, this does not mean that the party does not pay attention to the struggle against dogmatism and sectarianism that hinder our progress.

    Xinhua News Agency, November 23rd - Pyongyang newspapers published editorials on the 23rd, warmly welcoming the Declaration of the Meeting of Representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of Socialist Countries.

    The "Rodong Sinmun" editorial said: All members of the Korean Workers' Party and the Korean people warmly welcome and fully support this declaration, which has great historical significance for the international workers' movement and the communist movement. The editorial said that the unbreakable proletarian internationalist friendship and unity among socialist camp countries is the decisive guarantee of the final victory of peace and socialism. The Korean people regard this internationalist relationship among socialist camp countries as a reliable guarantee for their victory in the struggle for the peaceful reunification of the fatherland and the construction of socialism. The Korean people will always be loyal to the banner of proletarian internationalism and constantly consolidate and develop the friendship and unity of the socialist countries led by the Soviet Union.

    The "Democratic Korea" editorial said that under the powerful inspiration of this historic declaration, the Korean people are confidently moving towards new victories, and no obstacles can stop the Korean people, who are fighting for the peaceful reunification of the fatherland and socialist construction, from advancing towards victory.

    Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, November 23rd - Polish central newspapers prominently carried the full text of the Declaration of the Meeting of Representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of Socialist Countries on the 22nd.

    "Głos Pracy," "Życie Warszawy," and "Trybuna Wolności" also published editorials and special articles today welcoming the Declaration of the Meeting of Representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of Socialist Countries.

    "Trybuna Ludu" published an editorial on the 23rd saying that all participants in the meeting agreed that the unity between parties and between countries should be strengthened and developed. This unity is the foundation for the further development of these countries. The meeting discussed and adopted the principles of cooperation and unity between the parties that are building socialism and the socialist countries. The meeting adopted the principles expressed in the resolutions of the 20th Congress of the CPSU, the declaration of the Soviet government on October 30, 1956, the joint Soviet-Polish statement on November 18, 1956, and many other documents. These are the Leninist principles of relations between parties and socialist countries.

    The proletarian party cannot ignore the characteristics of the nation to which it belongs. At the same time, it cannot forget the basic universal principles of Marxism. Without paying attention to this point, there is no way to talk about socialist construction. The declaration says that the creative application of the common laws of socialist construction and the diversification of forms and methods of socialist construction in various countries are the collective contribution of various parties to Marxist-Leninist theory.

    "Trybuna Ludu" then wrote that the meeting emphasized the need to wage a resolute struggle on two fronts, namely against revisionism and against dogmatism. The Communist Party considers revisionism to be the main danger. The meeting believes that revisionism is a manifestation of bourgeois ideology, which paralyzes the revolutionary will of the working class and demands the preservation or restoration of capitalism.

    Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, November 23rd - Hungary's "Népszabadság" carried the full text of the Declaration of the Meeting of Representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of Socialist Countries on the 22nd.

    "Magyar Nemzet" called the declaration an extremely important document in international politics. The newspaper wrote that this declaration once again shows the solidarity of socialist countries. It assessed the international factors that determine the currently decisive issue - the issue of peace. The newspaper emphasized that "in our era, the development of the world depends on the process and outcome of the competition between two opposing social systems."

    "Népszava" wrote that this declaration once again eloquently proves that the communist movement consciously embodies the objective laws of historical development, and it is the only political force capable of attracting an increasingly wider range of masses to change the old world and build a new world that can dispel the dark clouds of war.

    Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, November 23rd - Mongolia's "Ünen" prominently carried the news of the Meeting of Representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of Socialist Countries and the full text of the Declaration of the Meeting on the 22nd.

    Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, November 23rd - Albanian newspapers all carried the news of the Meeting of Representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of Socialist Countries on the front page on the 22nd. The newspapers carried the full text of the Declaration of the Meeting.

    Xinhua News Agency, November 23rd - Yugoslavia's "Borba" and "Politika" carried detailed summaries of the Declaration of the Meeting of Representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of Socialist Countries held from November 14th to 16th on the 23rd, and other newspapers also carried summaries of the Declaration.

    社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议宣言公布后
    社会主义各国报纸热烈评论
    据新华社23日讯　民主德国的“新德意志报”、“柏林日报”、“论坛报”和“青年世界报”都刊载了社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议宣言全文。其他报纸发表了摘要。刊载和发表评论的还有在德累斯顿出版的“萨克森日报”。
    “柏林日报”的标题是“社会主义在全世界胜利是不可避免的”。这家报纸写道，共产党和工人党在团结自己的队伍和争取工人阶级和世界各国人民的团结的同时，毫不犹豫地克服着自己道路上的一切障碍，并且将在争取全世界的和平、民主和社会主义的斗争中取得新的、辉煌的胜利。
      “论坛报”说，社会主义国家共产党和工人党应该坚持马克思列宁主义的普遍真理同各国革命和建设的具体实践相结合的原则，按照各国的具体条件，创造性地运用社会主义革命和社会主义建设的共同规律，并且互相学习和交流经验。
    德意志通讯社报道了共和国各阶层人民的代表人物的许多谈话，他们热烈欢迎这个公报的发表，并且着重指出了公报的巨大意义，认为这个文件体现了和平阵营的威力，反映了对社会主义胜利的坚定信心。
    据新华社23日讯　保加利亚各报22日刊载了社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议宣言全文。“工人事业报”和“农业旗帜报”都发表了社论。
    “工人事业报”指出，社会主义各国的领导力量是它们的久经考验的马克思列宁主义政党。为了本国人民的利益以及和平和社会主义的利益，社会主义各国不断地加强着彼此间的团结和友好合作。代表会议宣言是社会主义各国间这种团结和对目前国际局势以及国际共产主义运动中一些问题的看法完全一致的又一辉煌表现。它是一个具有重大意义的文献。社会主义阵营各国的力量就在于彼此间的牢不可破的团结。这种团结是以战无不胜的马克思列宁主义思想和社会主义国际主义原则为基础的。社论继续说，保加利亚人民坚定地站在社会主义阵营里，是这一阵营的不可分割的一部分，同它有着同生共死的血肉联系。保加利亚人民像保护眼珠一样维护着这一阵营的团结，加强同苏联和其他社会主义国家的友谊。
    新华社布拉格23日电　捷克斯洛伐克“红色权利报”和其他中央一级报纸22日都登载了社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议宣言。
    “红色权利报”23日就这个宣言发表了社论。
    社论说，社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议宣言对国际局势问题和争取和平的斗争问题给予了极大的重视。现在全世界的发展决定于两个对立的社会体系竞赛的进程和结果。在这一竞赛中，社会主义已经明显地显示出了它的巨大的优越性和坚强的生命力。资本主义正在无可挽救地走近死亡。除了准备战争之外，帝国主义者再也没有别的出路来摆脱它所处的绝境。在这方面，美国侵略集团起着特别的作用，它是我们这个时代中的世界反动中心，是人民群众最凶恶的敌人。反对发动新战争计划的斗争，反对威胁全欧洲人民的德国军国主义的斗争是我们的首要任务。
    社论接着写道，社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表所签订的宣言表明，在这些党相互关系的一切问题上是完全一致和彼此谅解的。
    社论着重指出，第一个胜利了的社会主义国家苏联是整个社会主义阵营的核心，紧紧地团结在苏联的周围是社会主义国家团结的基础。
    社论指出，捷克斯洛伐克的党把修正主义看做是共产主义运动的主要危险。当然，这并不是说党就不注意同阻碍我们前进的教条主义和宗派主义进行斗争。
    新华社23日讯　平壤各报23日发表社论，热烈欢迎社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议的宣言。
  “劳动新闻”的社论说：朝鲜劳动党全体党员和朝鲜人民热烈欢迎和全面支持这个对国际工人运动和共产主义运动有巨大历史意义的宣言。社论说，社会主义阵营国家间的牢不可破的无产阶级的国际主义友谊团结，是和平和社会主义最后胜利的决定性的保证，朝鲜人民把社会主义阵营国家的这种国际主义的关系看作是自己在和平统一祖国和建设社会主义的斗争中取得胜利的可靠保证，朝鲜人民将永远忠实于无产阶级国际主义的旗帜，不断地巩固和发展以苏联为首的社会主义国家的友谊团结。
    “民主朝鲜报”的社论说，朝鲜人民在这个历史性的宣言的有力鼓舞下，满怀信心地走向新的胜利，任何障碍也阻挡不住为和平统一祖国和社会主义建设而斗争的朝鲜人民向胜利前进。
    新华社华沙23日电　波兰各中央级报纸22日以显著地位刊载了社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议宣言全文。
    “劳动之声报”、“华沙生活报”和“自由战士报”今天也都发表社论和专论欢迎社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议宣言。
    “人民论坛报”23日发表社论说，所有参加会议者都一致认为，应该加强和发展各党和各个国家之间的团结。这种团结是这些国家进一步发展的基础。会议讨论和通过了建设社会主义的各党和社会主义各国合作和团结的原则。会议通过了在苏共第二十次代表大会的决议中、1956年10月30日苏联政府的宣言中，1956年11月18日波苏联合声明中以及其他许多文件中所表现的原则。这是各党和社会主义各国间关系的列宁主义原则。
    无产阶级政党不能忽视它本身所属的民族的特点。同时它也不能忘记马克思主义基本的普遍原则，忽视了这一点就根本谈不上社会主义建设。宣言说，社会主义建设共同规律的创造性运用，各国社会主义建设形式和方法的多样化是各党对马克思列宁主义理论的集体贡献。
    “人民论坛报”接着写道，会议强调指出在两条战线上进行坚决斗争的必要性，那就是反对修正主义和反对教条主义。共产党认为修正主义是主要的危险。会议认为修正主义是资产阶级意识形态的表现，它麻痹工人阶级的革命意志，要求保存或者恢复资本主义。
    新华社布达佩斯23日电　匈牙利“人民自由报”22日刊载了社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议的宣言全文。
    “匈牙利民族报”把这个宣言称为国际政治中极其重要的文件。这家报纸写道，这个宣言又一次显示了社会主义各国的团结一致。它对决定当前具有决定性的问题——和平问题的国际因素作了估价。报纸着重指出，“在我们的时代里，世界的发展取决于两个对立的社会体系的竞赛的进程和结果。”
    “人民意志报”写道，这个宣言又一次雄辩地证明，共产主义运动自觉地体现了历史发展的客观规律，它是唯一能够吸引越来越广泛的群众来改变旧世界和建立能够驱散战争乌云的新世界的政治力量。
    新华社乌兰巴托23日电　蒙古“真理报”22日以显著地位刊载了社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议消息和代表会议宣言全文。
    新华社地拉那23日电　阿尔巴尼亚各报都在22日的第一版上登载了社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议的消息。各报登载了代表会议宣言全文。
    新华社23日讯　南斯拉夫“战斗报”和“政治报”23日刊载了11月14日到16日社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议的宣言的详细摘要，其他报纸也刊载了宣言的摘要。“战斗报”、“政治报”和其他报纸刊载了11月16日到19日在莫斯科举行的共产党和工人党代表会议的消息和和平宣言。
