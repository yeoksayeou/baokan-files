    叙埃政界盼望成立埃叙联邦
    据新华社大马士革18日电　到叙利亚访问的埃及国民议会代表团团长萨达特在16日拜会叙利亚国民议会议长胡拉尼以后说，成立埃及—叙利亚联邦的协议就可以签字了。
    胡拉尼16日说，叙埃两国将要举行会谈，讨论成立两国联邦的问题。他又说，埃及议会代表团16日在叙利亚受到的热诚欢迎表明，叙亚利人民正在盼望叙埃两国联合。
    叙利亚外交部长比塔尔16日在埃及议会代表团访问他的时候说，叙利亚人和埃及人正在殷切期待两国政府为实现两国的联合而采取又一个坚定的步骤。比塔尔又说：“我们应该在这个时代做出一些有历史意义的事情。”
    萨达特回答他说：“我要告诉叙利亚人民，我们埃及的议员们很清楚地知道我们对于实现和叙利亚联合的责任；我们将为达到这个目的而进行斗争。”他又说：“我应当向叙利亚人民致敬，因为他们在保卫自己的自由、尊严和独立的斗争中采取了坚定的立场。我要向你们保证，每一个埃及人都愿意做保卫叙利亚领土的战士。”
    叙利亚某些政界领袖和绝大部分有影响的报纸也表示欢迎埃及和叙利亚建立更密切的关系。
