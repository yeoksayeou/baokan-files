    Celebrating the 40th Anniversary of the October Revolution
    Mao Dun Cables Congratulations to Smirnov

    To Comrade Smirnov, Acting First Secretary of the Soviet Writers' Union,

    Dear Comrade Smirnov:

    On the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution, I, on behalf of all Chinese writers, extend warm congratulations to the glorious Soviet writers and the fraternal Soviet people with unparalleled excitement.

    The October Socialist Revolution opened a new era for the working people of the world, illuminating the path of human progress like the rising sun. Over the past forty years, under the leadership of the great Soviet Communist Party, the great Soviet people have built a happy, prosperous, and incomparably powerful socialist Soviet Union through long-term and heroic struggles, setting a glorious example for the working people of all countries. The powerful existence of the great Soviet Union and its strong assistance to the people of all countries have become a great source of encouragement for the world's people in their struggle for peace, democracy, national independence, and the path of socialism. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people, following the path of the October Socialist Revolution, have achieved victory in the democratic revolution and the socialist revolution. In the revolutionary struggle and in the construction to realize socialist industrialization, the Chinese people have always received fraternal, sincere, and selfless assistance from the Soviet people. In terms of literary creation, Soviet literature, from the early days of the revolution, has attracted and educated the people of all countries with its profound revolutionary content and excellent artistic techniques. The Chinese people have always been loyal readers of Soviet literature, regarding it as a textbook for life. From October 1949 to December 1956, our country published a total of 2,746 kinds of Soviet literary and art books, some of the important works were printed in hundreds of thousands to more than one million copies.

    Since the autumn of 1956, a counter-current of anti-Marxist revisionism has emerged in the world. Some people have painstakingly attacked socialist realism in literature and art, and attacked Soviet literature, but their intentions are futile. Lies and ravings cannot deceive people's reason. Chinese writers are watching the brilliant achievements of Soviet literature with great joy, and are happy to see that socialist realism has become a powerful literary trend in the world. Chinese writers have always taken Soviet literature as their example, earnestly learning from its rich experience, and are determined to work with fraternal Soviet writers to defend the literary path of socialist realism.

    Today, as the Soviet people warmly celebrate the great festival of the October Socialist Revolution for all mankind, the Chinese people are deeply rejoiced by the great achievements of the Soviet people. We sincerely thank the great Soviet Union for its tremendous assistance to us. The profound friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union, linked together for a common cause, is as solid as a rock and will last forever. We wish our great brotherly country, the Soviet Union, growing prosperity and strength, and eternal victory in the struggle for the progress of all mankind! We wish the glorious Soviet literature will blossom more splendidly and bear more abundant fruits.

        Mao Dun, Chairman of the Chinese Writers Association

    庆祝十月革命四十周年
    茅盾电贺斯米尔诺夫苏联作家协会代理第一书记斯米尔诺夫亲爱的斯米尔诺夫同志：
    值此伟大的十月社会主义革命四十周年的日子，我谨代表全体中国作家，以无比兴奋的心情，向光荣的苏联作家和兄弟的苏联人民致以热烈的祝贺。
    十月社会主义革命，为全世界劳动人民开辟了新纪元，像初升的太阳，照亮了人类前进的道路。四十年来，伟大的苏联人民在伟大的苏联共产党的领导下，经过长期的英勇奋斗，建成了幸福、繁荣和无比强大的社会主义苏联，为各国劳动人民树立了光辉的榜样。伟大苏联的强大存在，以及它对各国人民的强有力的援助，已经成为世界人民争取和平、民主、民族独立和社会主义道路的巨大的鼓舞力量。中国人民在中国共产党的领导下，遵循着十月社会主义革命的道路，取得了民主革命和社会主义革命的胜利。在革命斗争当中，以及在实现社会主义工业化的建设当中，中国人民始终得到苏联人民的兄弟般的真诚无私的援助。在文学创作方面，苏联文学从革命的初期，就以它深刻的革命内容和优异的艺术技巧吸引和教育着各国人民。中国人民从来都是苏联文学的忠实读者，他们把苏联文学当作生活的教科书。从1949年10月到1956年12月，我国出版的苏联文艺书籍共达二千七百四十六种，其中一些重要的作品，印行数都在几十万册到一百万册以上。
    1956年秋季以来，世界上出现了一股反马克思主义的修正主义的逆流，有些人煞费苦心地攻击文学艺术上的社会主义现实主义，攻击苏联文学，但是，他们的用心是徒劳的。谎言和呓语，不能欺骗人们的理智。中国作家，以十分欣喜的心情注视着苏联文学的光辉成就，并且高兴地看到，社会主义现实主义已经成为世界范围的强大的文学潮流，中国作家始终以苏联文学做为自己的榜样，认真学习它的丰富经验，并决心和兄弟般的苏联作家一起，为保卫社会主义现实主义的文学道路而奋斗。
    今天，当苏联人民热烈庆祝十月社会主义革命这一全人类的伟大节日的时候，中国人民深深为苏联人民的伟大成就而欢欣鼓舞。我们衷心感谢伟大苏联给予我们的巨大援助。为共同事业联结起来的中苏两国人民的深厚友谊，坚如磐石，万世长存——祝我们伟大的兄弟之邦——苏联，日益繁荣，日益强大，在为全人类的进步事业所进行的斗争中永远胜利！祝光荣的苏联文学开出更加绚丽的花，结成更加丰硕的果实。
        中国作家协会主席　茅盾
