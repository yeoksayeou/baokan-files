Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, November 24th. The Lebanese authorities' action on the 22nd of refusing entry to a Syrian parliamentary delegation has provoked widespread indignation here and in Lebanon.

The delegation, consisting of seventeen people representing all parties in the Syrian parliament, was supposed to go to Lebanon to congratulate Maronite Patriarch Maouchi on Lebanese Independence Day. However, they were refused entry at the Lebanese border.

The Speaker of the Syrian Parliament, al-Hawrani, sent a telegram to the Speaker of the Lebanese Parliament, Oseiran, on the same day, accusing the Lebanese authorities of taking "arbitrary and astonishing" measures. The Syrian cabinet held a meeting on the evening of the 23rd to discuss Lebanon's actions.

Syrian newspapers have also criticized Lebanon's actions. "Alif Ba" published an editorial on the 23rd pointing out that the Lebanese authorities' actions "once again prove that the current Lebanese regime is a divisive regime that serves imperialism and the enemies of Arab nationalism." The newspaper praised Patriarch Maouchi, saying that he was the first person in Lebanon to oppose "Eisenhowerism." "Al-Jamahir" also criticized the current Lebanese government in an editorial, saying that it is an agent of imperialists, especially American imperialists.

At the same time, leaders of the Lebanese opposition bloc refused to participate in the official Independence Day celebrations in protest against the measures taken by the government.

The Lebanese opposition party, the National United Front, also issued a statement accusing the government of its policies towards Arab countries and its foreign policy. Patriarch Maouchi also said that the government's measures were "absurd and ridiculous actions" and expressed disappointment. Maouchi has always criticized the Lebanese government's policies and is closer to the Lebanese opposition.

On the evening of the 22nd, a mass rally was also held in Beirut to condemn the government's actions.

Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, November 23rd. The Egyptian National Assembly delegation returned to Cairo from Damascus on the afternoon of the 22nd.

The head of the Egyptian National Assembly delegation, Sadat, paid a visit to President Kuwatly before his departure. Kuwatly gave him a letter to President Nasser, thanking Egypt for its support of Syria in opposing provocations from the United States and Turkey, and congratulating Nasser on the formation of a federation between the two countries.

In a speech on the 21st, Sadat said: "All Arab countries are happy for Egyptian-Syrian unity, but the imperialists, the enemies of Arab nationalism, are saddened by this."

    黎巴嫩无理拒绝叙议会代表团入境
    叙黎两国舆论震怒
    埃及议会代表团访叙完毕返开罗
    据新华社大马士革24日电　黎巴嫩当局在22日拒绝叙利亚议会代表团进入黎巴嫩的行动，在这里和黎巴嫩激起了广泛的愤慨。
    由代表叙利亚议会各党派的十七人组成的代表团，本来要去黎巴嫩向基督教马罗派主教迈乌什祝贺黎巴嫩独立日。但是他们在黎巴嫩的边界上被拒绝入境。
    叙利亚议会议长胡拉尼在当天打电报给黎巴嫩议会议长奥塞兰，指责黎巴嫩当局所采取的措施是“专横和令人惊异的”。叙利亚内阁已经在23日晚上举行会议，讨论黎巴嫩的行动。
    叙利亚报纸也纷纷抨击黎巴嫩的行动。“阿利夫巴报”23日发表社论指出，黎巴嫩当局的行动“又一次证明，目前黎巴嫩政权，是为帝国主义和阿拉伯民族主义的敌人服务的制造分裂的政权”。这家报纸赞扬迈乌什主教，说他是黎巴嫩反对“艾森豪威尔主义”的第一人。“群众报”也在社论中抨击目前黎巴嫩的政府，说它是帝国主义者、特别是美帝国主义者的代理人。
    同时，黎巴嫩反对派集团的领袖为了抗议政府所采取的措施，拒绝参加官方举行的独立日庆祝会。
    黎巴嫩反对党民族统一阵线也发表声明，指责政府的对阿拉伯国家的政策和对外政策。迈乌什主教也说政府的这种措施是“荒谬可笑的行动”，并且表示失望。迈乌什一向批评黎巴嫩政府的政策，他同黎巴嫩反对党比较接近。
    22日晚间，贝鲁特还举行了群众大会，谴责政府这种行动。
    据新华社大马士革23日电　埃及国民议会代表团22日下午从大马士革回到开罗。
    埃及国民议会代表团团长萨达特在行前曾经拜会库阿特利总统。库阿特利交给他一封带给纳赛尔总统的信，信中对埃及支持叙利亚反对美国和土耳其的挑衅表示感谢，并且为两国结成联邦向纳赛尔表示祝贺。
    萨达特在21日发表的谈话中说：“一切阿拉伯国家都为埃叙团结而高兴，但是，阿拉伯民族主义的敌人帝国主义者却因此悲伤。”
