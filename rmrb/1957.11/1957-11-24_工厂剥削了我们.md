Editor's Note: "The Factory Exploited Us" and "You Have to Speak with Conscience" are based on conversations between Yan Tianxiang and Li Lanzhen with a cadre of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee. These two articles show that some new and old workers have drastically different views on current welfare issues in enterprises. According to our understanding, this kind of divergence between new and old workers is quite common. Comrade Dong Jin expressed his opinions on this issue in the article "Must Compare with the Past." We believe that these three articles are of some reference value to the debate on welfare issues in enterprises, so we are publishing them together here.

The Factory Exploited Us
Youth Worker of Beijing State-owned Cotton Mill No. 1, Yan Tianxiang

My home is in Nan苑 (Nanyuan). After graduating from senior primary school, I came to Beijing State-owned Cotton Mill No. 1 in August 1954. Originally a roving frame worker, I am now a roving frame carrier in the spinning workshop (auxiliary worker).

The welfare of State-owned Cotton Mill No. 1 is substantial, but it is less for us auxiliary workers, especially for auxiliary workers in the spinning workshop. For example, we have been requesting work clothes for more than two years, but the leadership always says that our work doesn't require work clothes. The factory always talks about saving money in everything, which we don't oppose, but they haven't seen how many pairs of pants we've worn out and how many pieces of skin have been scraped off our legs! For example, it doesn't cost money for employees to see a doctor, which is a great welfare, and the state spends a lot of money on it, but the clinic doesn't solve the problem. Small illnesses are not cured, and bigger illnesses are always sent to the city. As for subsidies, it's useless for any auxiliary worker to apply, even if the group and team discussions pass it and the application form is filled out. The canteen food is a welfare for our workers, but there is little rice and small buns, and we can't afford to eat it. The workers have argued with the canteen over this issue countless times while holding their rice bowls. It has improved a bit now, but it still doesn't meet the standard. The canteen makes money every month, but I have only eaten cheap meals once in the three years I've been here. In the past, the factory gave out bath tickets and haircut tickets, but now a haircut costs 15 cents, which is too expensive! Where does this money go? The finance department adds the barbers' wages, supplies and other expenses together, so of course they will lose money! If we include the welfare funds given to us by the state, I would say they are definitely making money off of us! Those living in collective dormitories pay 40 cents per person per month for rent, which doesn't seem expensive, but how many people live in one room! How much does a family dormitory cost? Six to nine square meters cost a little over a yuan a month, the rent is low, and the conditions are good, so which one is more comfortable? Where does the 40 cents go?

Everything costs money in our factory. Watching movies also costs money, and it's only free when there's no way to sell tickets (such as when performing in the courtyard)! When outside theater troupes come to perform, some actors from our factory's troupe can not buy tickets, and some cadres also do not buy tickets, they are taking advantage of the workers! Where does the money from selling tickets go? It goes to the club, they have not published the accounts, because there is no way to publish them.

In our factory, there are many conditions for workers to get housing, such as only those whose homes are more than 2,000 miles away are given housing, and those who marry before the age of 25 are not given housing. The Marriage Law stipulates that you can marry at the age of 20, but here they restrict people from getting married by not giving them housing. The factory also stipulates that those without five years of service are not given housing. Look, State-owned Cotton Mill No. 1 has only been built for a few years! In my opinion, there should be no conditions for housing at all. Everyone is a worker and should not be divided into new and old, let alone those who live close to home and those who live far away, otherwise those whose homes are in Beijing will never be able to move in!

The wages of our auxiliary workers are unreasonable and not based on work. Newcomers, auxiliary workers and spinning operators get the same wages, but later their wages increased, and we still get apprentice wages. During the wage reform, the leadership said that "all" workers' wages "have increased," and the auxiliary workers' wages increased to 48.6 yuan, but it is still different from the doffers. In the old factory, auxiliary workers and doffers get the same wages. We demand pay according to work; although we have no skills, we have strength. We can learn the work of a spinning operator in six months, but if you let the spinning operator learn our work, they don't have the strength. Is skill valuable, or is strength valuable? Skills can be learned, but strength is innate! We asked to be transferred out to learn skills, but the leadership did not approve it. If we don't learn skills, that's fine, as long as we are paid more! Now the leadership is constantly asking us to sell our strength and not giving us a raise. I have increased from handling 32 spinning frames to 61 spinning frames, and recently the workshop director even wants me to increase two more. I said: Not only will I not increase it, but I also don't want to do it! Increasing the number of frames is okay, but is it paid according to work? Where did the wage of the worker who was reduced by me managing more machines go?

Which expenses should be paid from the welfare fund to be considered reasonable? Now the leadership's calculations are different from ours. For example, for nurseries, except for the children's food which is paid by the parents, nothing else should be charged. Collective dormitories can charge rent, and the rent should be used as a repair fee. This expense is limited, and each person cannot be charged 40 cents, so the rent should be lowered. The canteen is also a welfare for the workers, so the wages of the cooks, furniture, etc. should not be borne by the workers.

Some people say: The furniture in the canteen is paid for by the welfare fund, I don't believe it. It was all purchased by making money off the workers. The price of food in our canteen is similar to that in restaurants, and they make enough money! The coal used by the canteen should not be borne by the workers either, otherwise the cost will be high, things will be expensive, and the welfare will not be apparent. All expenses of the barbershop should not be counted on the workers' bills either. Haircuts should not cost workers money at all.

Someone asked: If the welfare fund given by the state is 50 yuan and the factory spends 70 yuan, should the workers be charged the difference of 20 yuan? I don't think this will happen. The welfare fund given to us by the state is very large. State-owned Cotton Mill No. 1's eyes turn red when they see money, and they ask the workers for money everywhere. Isn't this the factory making money off our workers' welfare? For example, the trade union has a sports equipment fund, but the new basketball hoops were purchased with bonuses, so where did the part of the welfare given by the state go? There are many such things. My opinion is: The welfare that the state gives to us workers should all be enjoyed by us.

### 工厂剥削了我们

专栏：

    编者按：“工厂剥削了我们”“讲话得有良心”这两篇文章，是根据阎天祥和李兰珍对北京市委一个干部的谈话整理的。从这两篇文章中，可以看出某些新工人和老工人对目前企业中的生活福利问题，看法是截然不同的。据我们了解，新老工人之间的这种分歧，有相当的普遍性。冬今同志在“一定要和过去比”的文章中，对这个问题发表了自己的意见。我们认为这三篇文章对企业中进行的关于生活福利问题的辩论，有一定的参考价值，所以一起发表在这里。
    工厂剥削了我们
    北京国棉厂青工　阎天祥
    我家在南苑。高小毕业后，1954年8月来北京国棉一厂。原为磅纱工，现在是细纱车间的推纱工（辅助工）。
    国棉一厂的福利很大，但是轮到我们辅助工身上就差些了，尤其到了细纱车间的辅助工，那就更差了。譬如工作服，我们要求了两年多，领导总是讲我们的工作不需要工作服。工厂干什么都讲节约，这我们不反对，但是他们没有看见我们磨破了多少条裤子，腿上擦掉了多少块皮！又譬如职工看病不要钱，这是很大的福利，国家花在这上面的钱不少，但是医务室不解决问题，小病看不好，大一点的病尽往城里送。讲到补助，凡是辅助工申请，即使小组大组讨论通过了，填了申请书，也没用。食堂伙食是我们工人的福利，但是饭少，馒头小，吃不起，工人为这事端着饭碗和食堂不知吵过几次架，现在改进了一点，但是还不合标准。食堂月月挣钱，可是我来了三年了，就吃过一次便宜饭。过去厂里发洗澡票，发理发票，现在理发要一毛五，太贵了！要得了这些钱吗？财务科把理发员工资、用具等费用都加在一起，这样当然要赔钱！如果把国家给我们的福利费也算进去，我说准是他们赚了我们的钱！住集体宿舍的每人每月交四毛房钱，看起来不贵，可是一个房间住多少人呀！一间家属宿舍才收多少钱？六平方公尺到九平方公尺的一月一块多钱，房租少，条件又好，你说那一个舒服？收四毛钱，这些钱用到什么地方去了？
    我们厂样样要钱。看电影也要钱，实在没有办法卖票时（如在大院里演），才不要钱！厂外剧团来演戏，有些本厂剧团演员可以不买票，有的干部也不买票，他们沾了工人的光！卖票赚的钱哪里去了呢？归到俱乐部去了，他们没有公布过账目，因为没法公布。
    我们厂里，工人要房子的条件很多，什么家在两千里地以外的才给房，什么不满二十五岁结婚的不给房。婚姻法规定二十岁就可以结婚，这里以不给房子来限制人家结婚。厂里还规定没有五年工龄的不给房。你瞧瞧，国棉一厂建厂才几年呵！照我看，住房根本不应该规定什么条件，都是工人，就不应该分新的、老的，更不应该分家近的、家远的，要不然家在北京的一辈子也住不进来！
    我们辅助工的工资不合理，不是按劳取酬。才进厂的，辅助工和运转工（挡车工）拿一样的工资，后来他们的工资提高了，我们还是拿学徒工工资。工资改革时，领导上说工人工资“都有所增加”，辅助工涨到四十八元六角，但还是和落纱工不一样。在老厂，辅助工和落纱工拿一样的工资。我们要求按劳取酬，我们虽没有技术，但有力气。运转工的工作，我们六个月就能学会，但让运转工学我们的工作，他们没有力气。是技术值钱，还是力气值钱？技术可以学，力气却是天生的！我们要求调出去学技术，领导上不批准。不学技术也可以，只要钱给得多就行！现在领导上尽叫我们卖气力，不给涨工资，我已经从推三十二台的纱提高到推六十一台，最近车间主任还想要我增加两台。我说：不但不增加，还想不干呢！增加台数没关系，是不是按劳付酬了？我多管了车，减少的一个工人工资哪儿去了？
    哪些费用从福利费中开支才叫合理？现在领导上的算法和我们的算法不一样。譬如，托儿所，除小孩的伙食由家长负担外，其他都不应该收钱。集体宿舍可以收房租，房租应该作为修理费，这项开支有限，每个人收不了四毛钱，所以房租应该降低。食堂也是工人的福利，因此炊事员的工资、家具等等不应该由工人负担。
    有人说：食堂里的家具是由福利费开支的，我不信。这都是赚工人的钱然后置的，咱们食堂里的饭菜价钱和饭馆里差不多，他们赚足了钱！食堂用煤也不应该由工人负担，否则成本大，东西贵，就显不出福利来了。理发室的一切开支也不应该算在工人的账上，理发根本就不应该向工人要钱。
    有人问：如果国家给的福利费是五十元，厂里支出七十元，不足的二十元该不该向工人收费？我认为这种情况是不会发生的。国家给我们的福利费很多，国棉一厂见钱就眼红，处处向工人要钱，这不是工厂赚我们工人的福利费是什么呢？例如工会有一笔体育用品费，但是新的篮球架却是用奖金置的，那么国家给的这部分福利又哪里去了呢？这类事情不少。我的意见是：国家给我们工人的福利，应该全部让我们来享受。
