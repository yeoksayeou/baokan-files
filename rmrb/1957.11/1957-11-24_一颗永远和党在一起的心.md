    A Heart Forever With the Party
    Xiaolan
    After March 1928, puffs of thick smoke frequently rose from the Silver Screen Mountain and Lotus Mountain northwest of Haifeng City. This was the Kuomintang reactionaries carrying out a frantic retaliation against the people of Haifeng and Lufeng after the failure of the Haifeng and Lufeng Soviet regime. Villages were turned into ashes, and a cruel massacre was carried out day and night.
    In Haifeng City, at No. 5 Yanhou Street, a woman, along with her three children, was driven out of her home by the Kuomintang army. The woman's determined face was stained with tears. The eldest of the three children was no more than ten years old. This woman was Zheng, the wife of Chen Kuiya, the Propaganda Minister of the CCP Dongjiang Special Committee. That day, she had just received the tragic news of her husband's death under the enemy's knives. Before she could express the grief and indignation in her heart, she was driven out of her home by the Kuomintang.
    Zheng was an illiterate, kind, and ordinary housewife who diligently did her housework every day. She only knew that her husband was doing revolution, working for the Communist Party, but she did not fully understand what revolution was or what the Communist Party was at first. However, she loved her husband and trusted him, so she supported him and cared for him. In November 1927, the revolution was victorious, the Communist Party seized power, established the Soviet government, and launched a vigorous land revolution. The poor burned their land deeds and obtained land. The local bullies and evil landlords who had always done evil were suppressed. The people of the whole city were joyful and living a comfortable life. The revolution left her with profound and beautiful memories. At that time, she believed that her husband was right, that the revolution was good, and that the Communist Party was good.
    On this day, she was driven out of her home by the Kuomintang army, gritting her teeth and looking back with every step, taking her children to seek refuge with relatives nearby. She thought that one day she would return.
    On the surface, Zheng was silent, but in her heart, she was burning with hatred for the enemy. News of the Red Army's activities often came from the mountains, and sometimes news came that her husband was not dead. These true or false messages awakened her enthusiasm and hope. She believed that the Communist Party had not left, the Red Army had not failed, and the Soviet government would definitely return. In these difficult years, she relied on only two beliefs to survive: one was to raise her children to adulthood; the other was to wait for the Soviet government. At night, whenever she thought of her husband, she would call her children to her side and tell them that their father was a revolutionary Communist Party member who was killed by the Kuomintang. She also told them many stories of the Soviet era, deeply planting the seeds of revolution in the children's young hearts.
    Life became more and more difficult. It was impossible for her to support three children with her own hands. She worked tirelessly all day long, tearing tobacco leaves, pulling peanuts, spinning hemp, and chopping firewood to earn barely enough sweet potatoes to half-fill their bellies. As a result, she had no choice but to painfully send her eldest son to Hong Kong to be an apprentice, and her nine-year-old daughter to someone else as a child bride, leaving only her second son, Chen Zimin, by her side.
    The mother and son lived together for several years, accumulated some money, and Zheng sent her son to school. One night, after the neighbors had turned off their lights and gone to sleep, she secretly took out her husband's diaries and books, which she had treasured for many years, from her package. She called her son over and said to him seriously: Now that you can read, from these diaries and books, you will know what kind of person your father was. You must learn from your father.
    Towards the end of the War of Resistance Against Japan, Chen Zimin had grown into an adult. Under Zheng's teachings, he had developed a firm revolutionary will and joined the Party's underground work. During the Liberation War, he had been fighting guerrillas in the mountains. Unfortunately, on the eve of victory in 1949, he was killed by the enemy again. The blow of losing her son in her later years left Zheng with irreparable wounds. However, the darkness was about to pass, and the light was about to come. The news of the Communist Party's successive victories aroused excitement and joy in her wounded heart. The victory she had waited for for more than twenty years had finally arrived.
    Liberation came, and No. 5 Yanhou Street returned to Zheng's hands. On the wall of the hall hung two photos of Chen Kuiya and Chen Zimin, next to two certificates of a revolutionary martyr's family. With her hair streaked with gray, Zheng brought the three children left to her by her eldest son. She often pointed to the photos and said to them, "This is your grandfather, this is your uncle." Then she pointed to the martyr's certificate and said, "Grandfather and uncle both sacrificed themselves for the revolution. You must learn from their example!" She told the children the stories of the Great Revolution era over and over again, telling them to cherish today's happy life. As long as her heart was still beating, she would spread the seeds of revolution forever.
    Today, the people of Haifeng City are happily celebrating the 30th anniversary of the Soviet. Zheng is even more excited. In the Red Palace, where the establishment of the Soviet regime was announced thirty years ago, she saw a huge oil painting of her husband hanging on the wall of the palace. In front of a thousand visitors, she shouted the slogan "Long live the Communist Party" from the bottom of her heart.

    一颗永远和党在一起的心
    晓蓝
    1928年3月以后，海丰城西北的银屏山、莲花山里，经常冒起一团团的浓烟。这是海陆丰苏维埃政权失败以后，反动派对海陆丰人民在进行疯狂的报复。村庄变成了灰烬，残酷的大屠杀夜以继日地在进行。
    海丰城内盐后街五号一个女人，带着三个孩子被国民党军队从家里赶了出来，女人坚定的面庞上还带着泪痕，三个孩子最大的不过十岁，这个女人是中共东江特委宣传部长陈魁亚的妻子郑氏。这一天她才接到丈夫惨死在敌人屠刀下的噩耗，还没有来得及发出胸中悲愤就被国民党赶出了家园。
    郑氏是一个目不识字的善良的普通家庭妇女，每天勤勤恳恳地做着自己的家务事，她只知道自己的丈夫是干革命的，搞共产党的，但是究竟什么是革命？什么是共产党？她最初并不完全了解，但是她爱自己的丈夫，信任自己的丈夫，所以她支持他，体贴他。1927年11月革命胜利了，共产党掌握了政权，建立了苏维埃政府，掀起了轰轰烈烈的土地革命运动，穷人烧掉了地契，得到了土地，向来为非作歹的恶霸地主被镇压了，全城的人民个个都喜气洋洋，生活够安乐的了。革命给她留下了深刻而美好的记忆，那时她就相信丈夫是正确的，革命是好的，共产党是好的。
    这一天她被国民党军赶着咬紧牙关一步一回头地走出了家园，带着孩子投靠到附近亲戚家里。她想，终有一天她还要回来的。
    表面上郑氏是沉默无言的，她内心里却燃烧着对敌人的仇恨。从山沟里经常传来红军活动的消息，有时还传来丈夫没有死的消息。这些是真是假的消息唤醒了她的热情和希望。她相信共产党没有走，红军没有失败，苏维埃政府一定要回来。在这些艰难的岁月里，她赖以生存的，就只有两个信念：一个是把儿女抚养成人；一个是等待苏维埃政府。晚上，每当她想起丈夫的时候，她就把孩子们叫到身旁，告诉他们爸爸是干革命的共产党员，被国民党杀死了。又给他们讲许多苏维埃时代的故事，在孩子们幼稚的心里深深地种下了革命的种籽。
    生活越来越困难了，要靠她的一双手养活三个孩子是不可能的，她终日不停地劳动，撕烟叶、拔花生、纺麻、砍柴赚下了一顿半饱蕃薯，结果她只好忍痛把大儿子送到香港去当学徒，把九岁的女儿送给别人作童养媳，只留下二儿子陈子民在身边。
    母子俩相依为命地生活了几年，积累了一点钱，郑氏便把儿子送去念书。一天夜里，邻居都熄灯睡觉了，她偷偷地从包裹里拿出她珍藏多年的她丈夫的日记和书籍，把儿子叫过来，严肃地对他说：你现在认识字了，从这些日记和书里面，你就知道阿爸是怎样的人，你要学阿爸的样啊。
    抗日战争末期，陈子民已经长大成人了，在郑氏的教诲下，他已经有了坚定的革命意志，参加了党的地下工作，解放战争时期，他一直在山里打游击，可惜在1949年胜利的前夕，又被敌人杀害了。晚年丧子的打击给郑氏留下了难以医治的伤痕，可是黑暗就要过去了，光明就要来了，共产党节节胜利的消息在她受伤的心灵里又激起了兴奋和喜悦，等待了二十多年的胜利终于来了。
    解放了，盐后街五号又回到了郑氏的手里。在厅堂的墙上挂着陈魁亚、陈子民二张照片，旁边挂着两张烈属证。头发斑白的郑氏带着大儿子留给她的三个孩子，她经常指着照片，对他们说，这是你爷爷，这是阿叔，然后又指着烈属证说，爷爷、阿叔都是干革命牺牲的，你们要学他们的榜样啊！她把大革命时代的故事给孩子们讲了又讲，要他们珍惜今天幸福的生活。只要她的心还在跳动，她就要把革命的种籽永远撒播下去。
    今天全海丰城的人民都在兴高采烈地庆祝苏维埃三十周年，郑氏更是无比兴奋。她在三十年前宣布苏维埃政权成立的红宫，看到丈夫的巨幅油画像高挂在宫内墙上，她当着一千个参观者，从内心里高喊出了共产党万岁的口号。
