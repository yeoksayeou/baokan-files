    We warmly celebrate the 40th anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution. This revolution ushered in a new era in human history, an era of socialist victory and capitalist decline. After forty years of arduous struggle and construction, the Soviet Union has become a strong fortress of world peace and human progress. The Soviet Union's economic development speed far exceeds that of capitalist countries, and its achievements in science and culture have leapt to the first place in the world. The superiority of the socialist system is demonstrated in all aspects. Not long ago, the Soviet Union produced intercontinental ballistic missiles and recently successfully launched the first and second artificial earth satellites, opening up the path for mankind to travel to the stars and conquer outer space. This is an unprecedented event in the history of science, and it is good news for all mankind. This outstanding contribution of Soviet scientists makes the scientific achievements of the most developed capitalist countries pale in comparison and frightens the imperialists who are obsessed with the so-called policy of strength. As we commemorate this great holiday of the October Revolution today, we would like to pay the highest tribute to the Soviet scientists, the entire Soviet people, and the Soviet Communist Party, which victoriously leads the people towards a communist society.
    The October Revolution illuminated the path of liberation for oppressed nations all over the world. After the October Revolution, in 1919, China experienced the May Fourth Movement. This magnificent mass movement was later recorded in history as the turning point from China's old democratic revolution to the new democratic revolution. Comrade Mao Zedong once pointed out: "The May Fourth Movement occurred under the call of the world revolution at that time, under the call of the Russian revolution, and under the call of Lenin." At that time, China's advanced intellectuals and the working class expressed cheers for the October Revolution. Since the May Fourth Movement, Marxist ideology has been widely spread among the Chinese people, becoming an irresistible social trend of thought. Socialist culture began to form and develop in our country. Advanced intellectuals and revolutionary people eagerly regarded Marxist works as their most precious spiritual food, receiving revolutionary enlightenment education from them, and learning the communist world outlook and the theory and experience of proletarian revolution. People began to use the viewpoint of historical materialism to analyze and study China's social and revolutionary problems. Soviet literature, art, and films were loved by Chinese readers and audiences, encouraging our courage to fight for the independence and freedom of our nation. The proletarian literary movement led by Lu Xun became the only literary movement at that time. It was this great writer who translated and introduced Fadeyev's "The Rout" and Serafimovich's "The Iron Flood," introduced Plekhanov's and Lunacharsky's aesthetic works, and introduced Soviet woodcut art to Chinese appreciators.
    The victory of the Chinese people's revolution and the establishment of the People's Republic of China have provided sufficient conditions for large-scale socialist cultural construction. We are faced with the arduous task of building a socialist culture.
    The Soviet Union has accumulated rich and complete experience in socialist construction in the forty years since the October Revolution. Therefore, China regards learning from the Soviet Union as a basic policy for economic and cultural construction and strives to absorb the excellent achievements of Soviet socialist construction. Therefore, in just a few years, we have achieved great victories on the economic front and important achievements on the cultural front.
    The direction of Soviet culture is the direction of the development of culture for all progressive mankind. After the Soviet Communist Party and Lenin won the basic victory of the October Revolution, they put forward the issue of developing socialist culture. Lenin once refuted the fallacy that socialism could not be implemented in economically backward countries with underdeveloped cultures, and correctly pointed out that the socialist revolution that overthrew the rule by landlords and capitalists created the premise for developing human civilization. He also pointed out that after political and social changes have been made, cultural changes must be carried out. Without a complete cultural revolution, the complete realization of socialism is impossible.
    On the question of how to build socialist culture, Lenin resolutely opposed Bogdanov's anti-Marxist views and the tendency of the "Proletarian Culture Association" to act independently of the Party. Lenin emphasized that cultural undertakings must be subordinate to the tasks of the entire socialist revolution and socialist construction and accept the leadership of the Party and the state. He pointed out that the construction of the proletarian socialist culture is only possible by relying on all the cultural achievements left over from the past. Lenin said: "We must acquire all the culture left behind by capitalism and use it to build socialism. We must acquire all science, technology, knowledge, and art. Without these, we cannot build a communist society life. And these sciences, technologies, and arts are in the hands of experts, in their minds." (Lenin: "The Achievements and Difficulties of the Soviet Government") This raised the task of winning over and transforming bourgeois intellectuals, the task of workers, peasants, and their cadres learning from bourgeois experts, and the task of cultivating new experts from workers and peasants. The working class must wage an irreconcilable struggle against bourgeois ideology, while at the same time it must master all the culture left behind by capitalism. To accomplish this task, it must go through a long, arduous process of struggle. This is the basic policy for developing socialist culture formulated by the Soviet Communist Party and Lenin after the October Revolution. Our country has adopted such a policy after the liberation. Of course, the specific historical conditions of the Chinese revolution are different from those in the Soviet Union, and Chinese culture has its own profound traditions and distinct national characteristics. Therefore, we must be good at learning and be good at combining the advanced experience of the Soviet Union with the specific reality of China. In the past few years, we have worked hard to do this. Although we have inevitably made mistakes and shortcomings in our work, in general, the achievements have been great. Here, the comradely and enthusiastic help of Soviet experts has played an unforgettable and outstanding role. With the example of Soviet socialist construction and the help of Soviet experts, our construction cause is much smoother than the situation the Soviet Union faced in the early days of its founding.
    After the founding of the People's Republic of China, while restoring and developing the national economy, we have planned and systematically carried out the work of developing socialist culture. First, we strive to popularize revolutionary culture among the masses of the people as much as possible. We have implemented the socialist reform of education from higher education to general education; reorganized old scientific institutions, gradually expanded scientific undertakings, and brought scientific research undertakings into the orbit of socialist planning; reformed and developed national traditional art, so that all literary and artistic creations are subordinate to the goal of serving the working people. We have criticized various reactionary bourgeois idealist and individualist viewpoints on all ideological fronts, and launched a movement of self-education and self-transformation among the broad masses of intellectuals. All of these are to eliminate all feudalism and bourgeois old culture and build a revolutionary socialist new culture.
    In order to further prosper and develop socialist culture, the Chinese Communist Party put forward the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" last year. This policy was put forward under the specific historical conditions that the people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class has been basically consolidated, the economic foundation of capitalism has been basically abolished, and the ideological transformation of intellectuals has initially achieved results. Although China's socialist revolution in terms of ownership of the means of production has been basically completed, capitalist (and some feudalist) ideas and habits still exist in people's minds in large quantities. Since bourgeois ideological viewpoints still exist in people's minds, they are bound to stubbornly express themselves. However, problems that belong to the people internally, especially ideological problems, should not be resolved by means of suppression, but by means of persuasion. Allowing and encouraging free debate on various different ideological viewpoints in academic circles and free competition of various different creative styles in literature and art is a good way to develop science and art. Through this kind of free competition and free debate, the broad masses of the people can truly realize that only Marxist ideology and socialist culture are the most correct and progressive, while bourgeois culture based on the individualist world outlook has long become backward and reactionary. "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" has now become a good method to embody the broadest socialist democracy. The Chinese Communist Party has always emphasized that the mass line must be followed in all work and believes in the majority of the masses. The same is true in academic work and literary and artistic work. As Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Thorough materialists are fearless." The truth of Marxism-Leninism cannot be refuted. Free debate on academic issues will only benefit the proletariat and harm the bourgeoisie, and will only make more and more people believe in the truth of Marxism-Leninism, and not the opposite. In the field of literature and art, the result of free competition will also only be that works that are understood and appreciated by the masses of the people and are beneficial to the people will survive and develop; while poisonous weeds that are harmful to the people will inevitably be abandoned and eliminated. This truth has been proven by the vivid facts of the past year or so. The slogan "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" is by no means a slogan of "liberalization" as imagined by some bourgeois writers and reporters, but a battle slogan for developing socialist culture.
    Revisionists do not understand this at all. They distort this slogan from the right. They believe that advocating "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" is a concession to the bourgeoisie. They thought that under this slogan, proletarian ideology and bourgeois ideology can coexist peacefully, but facts have proven that they are wrong. Dogmatists reject this slogan from the "left." They are afraid that bourgeois ideological viewpoints will flood under this slogan. In fact, they do not believe in the vigorous fighting power of Marxism-Leninism, so they advocate adopting suppressive measures against all non-Marxist ideological viewpoints. They do not understand that bourgeois ideological viewpoints can only be identified by the masses of the people and thoroughly criticized when they are allowed to express themselves. Facts have proven that they are also wrong.
    The bourgeoisie and rightists among bourgeois intellectuals in our country took advantage of the slogan "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" and the opportunity of the Communist Party's rectification campaign to launch a frenzied attack on socialism. The spearhead of their attack was first directed at cultural and educational work. They thought this was a relatively weak defense line that they could easily break through. They vigorously promoted bourgeois culture and opposed socialist culture. In philosophy, they believed that bourgeois reactionary idealist philosophy was superior to Marxist philosophy. They denied the absoluteness of the contradictory struggle between materialism and idealism, thus attempting to reconcile the two, and actually attempting to restore bourgeois idealist philosophy. In social sciences, they believed that Marxism-Leninism was outdated or not in line with China's national conditions. They believed that following the universal truth of Marxism was dogmatism, thus advocating the restoration of bourgeois reactionary sociology, economics, law, history, etc. in China. In natural sciences and technological sciences, they opposed the principle of combining scientists' personal expertise with the needs of national construction and subordinating the former to the latter in scientific research. In literature and art, they opposed the policy that literature and art must serve socialism and serve workers, peasants, and soldiers; under the slogan of "writing the truth," they advocated that literary and artistic works should mainly expose the so-called "dark side" of the new society and promoted the false bourgeois "freedom of literature and art." They believed that the creative principle of socialist realism must be cancelled or modified. In journalism, they denied the principle that socialist journalism is a tool of the proletarian class struggle and advocated "freedom of the press" and "recording everything heard" to cater to the low-level tastes of the bourgeois direction. In education, they attacked the comprehensive reform of higher education that we have implemented on the basis of learning from the Soviet Union. In all these aspects, they opposed the leadership of the Communist Party. They said that the Communist Party was an "amateur" in cultural and educational work, and "amateurs" cannot lead "professionals." They demanded the abolition of the Communist Party's leadership in the entire cultural and educational work and even the entire national work, and demanded that it be replaced by bourgeois rightists; and advocated replacing Marxism-Leninism with bourgeois reactionary sociopolitical theories as the guiding ideology in national work. Of course, these conspiracies of the bourgeois rightists cannot succeed. For several months, under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Chinese people have launched a firm and thorough struggle against the rightists in the form of a great debate, causing the political conspiracies of the bourgeois rightists to go bankrupt. This struggle fully shows that the socialist revolution must not only achieve a complete victory economically, that is, in terms of ownership of the means of production, but also must achieve a complete victory on the political and ideological fronts. Without a complete victory on the political and ideological fronts, the socialist system cannot be consolidated. Socialist culture cannot be developed and strengthened.
    The historical experience of the October Revolution tells us that a new socialist culture cannot be created out of thin air; specialized talents of the working class cannot be cultivated in special "greenhouses." Socialist culture can only be built on the basis of its own national culture in the process of the working class and all working people fighting to build a socialist society. In order to develop socialist culture, the working class must have its own technical cadre force, and must have its own force of professors, teachers, scientists, journalists, writers, artists, and Marxist theorists. This is a grand force. To establish such a force and solve the great tasks that history has put forward to us, revolutionary intellectuals must strive to master all the cultural achievements left behind by the past, master the new achievements of modern science, and at the same time, must go to the masses for a long time, unconditionally, and wholeheartedly, go to the fiery struggle, and share the same breath and destiny with the workers and peasants. Only in this way can they train themselves to become socialist laborers and builders of socialist culture. Only when literary and art workers combine with the workers, peasants, and laboring masses can they obtain an endless source of artistic creation, and can they more easily overcome the extremely harmful individualistic pride and fame and fortune concepts that often grow in them.
    Comrade Khrushchev's recent conversation with Soviet writers, "Literature and art should maintain close contact with the lives of the people," powerfully refuted various erroneous and harmful viewpoints in the field of literature and art, and pointed out the correct path for further developing socialist literature and art, which is of great benefit not only to Soviet writers, but also to all progressive writers in the world.
    The Chinese people who are building socialism have always regarded their cause as a continuation of the great October Revolution. We pay close attention to studying and learning from all the experiences of the Soviet Union since the October Revolution. We have always regarded this experience as a priceless treasure, which will always illuminate our path forward.

    十月革命和建设社会主义文化的任务
    ——在北京文艺界庆祝十月社会主义革命四十周年大会上的讲话
    周扬
    我们热烈地庆祝伟大的十月社会主义革命的四十周年。这个革命开辟了人类历史的新时代，即社会主义胜利和资本主义衰亡的时代。苏联经过四十年艰苦卓绝的斗争和建设，成为了世界和平和人类进步的坚强堡垒。苏联经济发展的速度远远超过了资本主义国家，而科学和文化的成就已跃居世界第一位。社会主义制度的优越性在一切方面表现出来。不久以前，苏联制成了洲际弹道火箭，最近又成功地发射了第一颗和第二颗人造地球卫星，打开了人类向星际旅行和征服宇宙空间的途径。这是科学史上破天荒的大事，这是全人类的福音。苏联科学家的这一卓越贡献使最发达的资本主义国家的科学成就相形见拙，使迷恋于所谓实力政策的帝国主义者为之丧胆。我们在今天纪念十月革命这个伟大节日的时候，谨向苏联的科学家，全苏联人民和胜利地领导人民走向共产主义社会的苏联共产党致最崇高的敬意。
    十月革命照亮了全世界被压迫民族解放的道路。十月革命后，在1919年，我国发生了“五四”运动。这个波涛壮阔的群众运动、后来被作为中国从旧民主革命到新民主革命的转折点而载入史册。毛泽东同志曾经指出：“五四运动是在当时世界革命号召之下，是在俄国革命号召之下，是在列宁号召之下发生的。”当时中国先进的知识分子和工人阶级对十月革命表示欢呼。从五四运动以后，马克思主义思想就在中国人民中间得到广泛的传播，成为一种不可抗拒的社会思潮。社会主义文化在我国开始形成和发展。先进的知识分子和革命人民，如饥如渴地把马克思主义著作当作自己最宝贵的精神食粮，从这里得到革命的启蒙教育，从这里学习了共产主义的世界观和无产阶级革命的理论和经验。人们开始运用历史唯物主义的观点来分析和研究中国的社会问题和革命问题。苏联的文学、艺术和电影受到了中国广大读者和观众的热爱，鼓舞了我们为自己民族的独立自由而斗争的勇气。以鲁迅为首的无产阶级文学运动成为了当时唯一的文学运动。正是这位伟大作家翻译和介绍了法捷耶夫的“毁灭”和绥拉菲莫维奇的“铁流”，介绍了普列汉诺夫和卢纳察尔斯基的美学著作，并且把苏联的木刻艺术介绍给中国的欣赏者。
    中国人民革命的胜利和中华人民共和国的成立，为大规模的社会主义文化建设提供了充分的条件。在我们面前摆着建设社会主义文化的艰巨的任务。
    苏联在十月革命以后的四十年间，积累了社会主义建设的丰富的完整的经验，因此中国把向苏联学习作为进行经济建设和文化建设的一项基本政策，并且尽力吸取苏联社会主义建设的优秀成果。因此，在短短的几年间，我们在经济战线上取得了巨大的胜利，同时在文化战线上也取得了重要的成就。
    苏联文化的方向，就是全体进步人类文化发展的方向。苏联共产党和列宁在十月革命取得了基本胜利之后就提出了发展社会主义文化的问题。列宁曾经驳斥了在经济文化落后的国家不能实行社会主义的谬论，而正确地指出推翻地主和资本家统治的社会主义革命，正为发展人类文明创造了前提。他又指出在进行了政治变革和社会变革以后必须进行文化变革，没有整个文化革命，社会主义的完全实现是不可能的。
    列宁在如何建设社会主义文化的问题上坚决地反对了波格丹诺夫的反马克思主义的观点，反对了“无产阶级文化协会”对党闹独立性的倾向。列宁强调指出，文化事业必须服从于整个社会主义革命和社会主义建设的任务，接受党和国家的领导。他指出无产阶级的社会主义文化的建设，只有凭借过去遗留下来的全部文化的成果，才有可能。列宁说：“必须取得资本主义遗留下来的全部文化，用它来建设社会主义。必须取得全部科学、技术、知识和艺术。没有这些，我们就不能建设共产主义社会的生活。而这些科学、技术、艺术却在专家们的手中，在他们的头脑里。”（列宁：“苏维埃政权的成就和困难”）由此就提出了争取和改造资产阶级知识分子的任务，工人农民及其干部向资产阶级专家学习的任务，以及从工农中培养新的专家的任务。工人阶级必须和资产阶级思想进行不调和的斗争，同时又必须掌握资本主义所遗留的全部文化。要完成这个任务，必须经过一个长期的，艰苦的，斗争的过程。这就是苏联共产党和列宁在十月革命以后所规定的关于发展社会主义文化的基本方针。我国在解放后所采取的也正是这样的方针。当然，中国革命的具体历史条件和苏联有所不同，中国的文化又有自己深远的传统，带有自己民族的鲜明特色，因此我们必须善于学习，善于将苏联的先进经验和中国的具体实际结合起来。几年来，我们努力这样做了，虽然我们在工作中也不免犯过这样或那样的错误和缺点，但总的来说，成绩是很大的。在这里，苏联专家的同志般的热情的帮助起了令人难忘的卓越的作用。有了苏联社会主义建设的榜样和苏联专家的帮助，我们的建设事业就比苏联开国初期所处的状况要顺利得不知多少倍了。
    中华人民共和国成立以后，在恢复和发展国民经济的同时，我们有计划，有步骤地进行了发展社会主义文化的工作。我们首先努力使革命文化尽量普及到人民群众中。我们实行了从高等教育到普通教育的社会主义改革；改组了旧有的科学机构，逐步扩展了科学事业，使科学研究事业纳入社会主义计划的轨道；改革和发展了民族传统的艺术，使一切文学艺术的创造服从于为劳动人民服务的目标。我们在各个思想战线上批判了各种反动的资产阶级唯心主义和个人主义的观点，在广大知识分子中间展开了自我教育和自我改造的运动。所有这些，都是为了扫除一切封建主义和资产阶级的旧文化，建设革命的社会主义的新文化。
    为了社会主义文化的进一步繁荣和发展，中国共产党在去年提出了“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的方针。这个方针是在以工人阶级为领导的人民民主专政已经基本巩固，资本主义的经济基础已经基本废除，知识分子的思想改造已经初步获得成效这样的特定历史条件下提出的。中国在生产资料所有制方面的社会主义革命虽已基本完成，但资本主义的（其中还夹着一些封建主义的）思想和习惯却还大量地在人们头脑中存在。资产阶级的思想观点，既然在人们的头脑中还存在，就必然要顽强地表现出来。但凡属于人民内部的问题，特别是思想问题，不能采取压服的办法，而应当采取说服的办法来解决。容许和鼓励学术上的各种不同思想观点的自由辩论和文学艺术上各种不同创作风格的自由竞赛是发展科学和艺术的良好办法。通过这种自由竞赛和自由辩论，就能使广大人民真正认识只有马克思主义思想和社会主义文化才是最正确最进步的，而以个人主义世界观为基础的资产阶级文化则早已成为落后的和反动的了。“百花齐放，百家争鸣”现在已成为体现最广泛的社会主义民主的良好方法。中国共产党历来强调在一切工作中必须走群众路线，相信群众的多数。在学术工作和文学艺术工作中，也是如此。正如毛泽东同志所说：“彻底的唯物主义者是无所畏惧的”。马克思列宁主义的真理是驳不倒的。学术问题上的自由辩论，结果只会对无产阶级有利，而对资产阶级不利，只会使愈来愈多的人民群众相信马克思列宁主义的真理，而不会是相反。在文学艺术领域内的自由竞赛，其结果同样也只会是被人民群众所理解，所欣赏的，而又于人民有益的作品得到生存和发展；而于人民有害的毒草必然被唾弃，被淘汰。这个道理已经为一年多来的生动的事实所证明。“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的口号决不像某些资产阶级的作家、记者所想像的那样，是什么“自由主义化”的口号，而正是发展社会主义文化的战斗口号。
    修正主义者完全不了解这一点。他们从右的方面来歪曲这个口号。他们认为提倡“百花齐放，百家争鸣”是向资产阶级让步，他们以为在这个口号下，无产阶级思想和资产阶级思想可以和平共居，但是事实证明他们是错误的。教条主义者从
  “左”的方面来拒绝这个口号，他们害怕资产阶级思想观点在这个口号下泛滥起来，他们实际上是不相信马克思列宁主义的生气蓬勃的战斗力量，所以主张对一切非马克思主义的思想观点采取压服的手段。他们不了解资产阶级的思想观点，只有让他表现出来，才便于人民群众识别它，才便于对它进行彻底的批判。事实证明他们也是错误的。
    我国资产阶级和资产阶级知识分子中的右派，利用“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的口号，趁着共产党实行全党整风的机会，发动了向社会主义的猖狂进攻。他们进攻的矛头，首先指向文化教育工作。他们以为这是一条比较薄弱，他们容易突破的防线。他们极力宣扬资产阶级文化，反对社会主义文化。在哲学方面，他们认为资产阶级反动的唯心主义哲学比马克思主义的哲学更为优越，他们否认唯物主义和唯心主义之间的矛盾斗争的绝对性，从而企图把两者调和起来，实际就是企图使资产阶级唯心主义哲学复辟。在社会科学方面，他们认为马克思列宁主义已经过时，或者不合中国国情，他们认为遵从马克思主义的普遍真理就是教条主义，从而主张资产阶级反动的社会学、经济学、法学、历史学等等在中国复辟。在自然科学和技术科学方面，他们反对在科学研究工作中，科学家的个人专长和国家建设需要相结合而以服从国家建设需要为主的原则。在文学艺术方面，他们反对文艺必须为社会主义服务，必须为工农兵服务的方针；他们在“写真实”的口号下，主张文学艺术作品主要应当揭露新社会的所谓“阴暗面”，提倡虚伪的资产阶级的“文艺自由”。他们认为社会主义现实主义的创作原则必须取消或修改。在新闻工作方面，他们否认社会主义的新闻事业是无产阶级的阶级斗争的工具的原理，提倡“新闻自由”“有闻必录”相迎合低级趣味的资产阶级方向。在教育工作方面，他们攻击我们在学习苏联的基础上实行的高等教育的全面改革。在所有这些方面，他们都反对共产党的领导，他们说共产党在文化教育方面是“外行”，而“外行”不能领导“内行”，要求取消共产党在整个文化教育工作以至整个国家工作的领导权，而由资产阶级右派来代替；并且主张以资产阶级反动的社会政治学说来代替马克思列宁主义在国家工作中的指导地位。当然，资产阶级右派的这些阴谋是不能得逞的。几个月以来，中国人民在共产党的领导下，通过大辩论的形式，向右派展开了坚决彻底的斗争，使得资产阶级右派的政治阴谋归于破产。这次斗争充分表明，社会主义革命，不仅必须在经济上即生产资料所有制方面取得彻底的胜利，而且必须在政治战线上和思想战线上取得彻底的胜利。没有政治战线上和思想战线上的彻底胜利，社会主义制度是不可能巩固的。社会主义文化也是不可能发展壮大的。
    十月革命的历史经验告诉我们，新的社会主义的文化是不可能凭空创造出来的；工人阶级的专门人才是不可能在特殊的“温室”中培养出来的。社会主义文化只有在工人阶级和全体劳动人民为建成社会主义社会而斗争的过程中，在自己民族文化的基础上才能建设起来。为了发展社会主义的文化，工人阶级必须有自己的技术干部的队伍，必须有自己的教授、教员、科学家、新闻记者、文学家、艺术家和马克思主义理论家的队伍。这是一个宏大的队伍。要建立这样一个队伍，解决历史向我们提出的伟大任务，革命知识分子必须努力掌握过去所遗留下来的一切文化成果，掌握现代科学的新成就，同时必须长期地、无条件地、全身心地到群众中去，到火热的斗争中去，和工农群众同呼吸，共甘苦，只有这样才能把自己锻炼成为社会主义的劳动者和社会主义文化的建设者。文艺工作者只有同工农劳动群众相结合，才能获得艺术创造的无穷源泉，才较易于克服时常在他们身上滋长的那种极端有害的个人主义的骄傲情绪和名利观念。
    最近赫鲁晓夫同志与苏联作家的谈话，“文学艺术要同人民生活保持密切的联系”有力地驳斥了文艺领域内各种错误的和有害的观点，指明了进一步发展社会主义文学艺术的正确途径，不但对苏联的作家，而且对全世界一切进步作家都有极大的教益。
    正在建设社会主义的中国人民，一向把自己的事业看做是伟大的十月革命的继续，我们十分注意研究和学习十月革命以来的苏联的全部经验。我们从来把这种经验看做是无价之宝，它永远照耀着我们前进的道路。
