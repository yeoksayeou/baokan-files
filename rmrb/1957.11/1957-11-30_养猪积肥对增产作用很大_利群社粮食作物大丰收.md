    Raising Pigs and Accumulating Manure Greatly Contributes to Increased Production
    Liqun Cooperative Achieves a Bumper Harvest of Grain Crops

    (Xinhua News Agency Dispatch) The Liqun Agricultural Cooperative in Suiyang County, Guizhou Province, mobilized its members to raise pigs and accumulate manure in large quantities, which played an important role in achieving a bumper agricultural harvest. This autumn, the cooperative's grain yield increased from an average of 346 jin per mu last year to 580 jin, an increase of more than 67%. The production level of all forty farming households in the cooperative has caught up with that of well-to-do middle peasants.
    The Liqun Agricultural Cooperative is located in a semi-mountainous area with thin and poor arable land, and its grain yield has always been low. Since the establishment of the agricultural cooperative, farming techniques have been continuously improved, but the increase in output has not been significant due to insufficient fertilizer. After last year's autumn harvest, the cooperative summarized the important reasons for the low output, and then put forward the slogan "People raise pigs, pigs nourish the fields, and fields feed the people" to the members, mobilizing everyone to raise pigs and accumulate manure in large quantities, and promptly helping members solve specific difficulties such as pig sources, funds, and feed. The cooperative now has 276 pigs, averaging 6.9 pigs per household, double the number last year. Due to the large-scale pig raising, the fertilizer increased rapidly. This year, the cooperative's paddy fields were generally top-dressed more than twice, and the amount of fertilizer applied per mu increased from 3,120 jin last year to 4,800 jin, of which pig manure accounted for 60% of the total fertilizer application. Because of the large increase in fertilizer application and the improvement of farming techniques, the grain yield per unit area has greatly increased. The Cement Dam Production Team increased grain production by two times this year after increasing fertilizer application by one time compared to last year. Last year, the cooperative was short of nearly 50,000 jin of grain for food. This year, in addition to handing over public grain and selling a large amount of surplus grain, each person has an average of 629 jin of grain. The large-scale pig raising in the Liqun Agricultural Cooperative not only provided important conditions for a bumper grain harvest, but also greatly increased the cash income of the members. The cooperative has already earned 17,655 yuan from pig raising, with an average income of 441 yuan per household, double that of last year.

    养猪积肥对增产作用很大
    利群社粮食作物大丰收
    据新华社讯  贵州省绥阳县利群农业社发动社员大量养猪积肥，对农业获得大丰收起了重要作用。这个社今秋粮食产量平均每亩由去年的三百四十六斤提高到五百八十斤，增产67％以上。全社四十户农民的生产水平都赶上了富裕中农。
    利群农业社位于半山地区，耕地瘦薄，历年粮食产量都较低。自从成立农业社以后，耕作技术不断改进，但因肥料不足，产量增加仍不显著。去年秋收后，社里总结了产量不高的重要原因，随后向社员提出了“人养猪、猪养田、田养人”的口号，发动大家大量养猪积肥，并及时帮助社员解决猪源、资金和饲料等具体困难。全社现已养猪二百七十六头，平均每户达六点九头，比去年增加一倍。由于大量养猪，肥料增加迅速，今年全社的稻田普遍追肥二次以上，每亩施肥量由去年三千一百二十斤增加到四千八百斤，其中猪肥占总施肥量的60％。因为大量的增施肥料，和耕作技术的改进，粮食单位面积产量大大提高。水泥坝生产队比去年增施肥料一倍后，今年粮食增产二倍。去年全社缺少口粮近五万斤，今年全社除交公粮、卖出大批余粮外，平均每人还有粮食六百二十九斤。利群农业社大量养猪不仅提供了粮食大丰收的重要条件，还大大增加社员的现金收入，全社养猪已收入一万七千六百五十五元，平均每户已收入四百四十一元，比去年增加一倍。
