    Building Pens is a Must for Raising Pigs
    After reading the article "Building Pens is a Must for Raising Pigs" published on page 2 of the People's Daily on November 18th, and considering the situation in our area, I feel even more strongly that building pens for raising pigs is necessary.
    Along the 200-kilometer highway from Xinyang, Henan, to Yeji Set, most of the livestock raised by residents on both sides have no pens. Livestock wander back and forth on the highway unattended, and pig manure is everywhere. Often, drivers do not notice the stray livestock and run them over. Then the masses stop the vehicles from proceeding, often leading to disputes. From January to November this year alone, eighty-six pigs and three cows were run over and killed. If we calculate that each pig manure increases grain production by 200 jin, the fertilizer lost from these eighty-six pigs would result in a reduction of 17,000 jin of grain, not counting other losses. Based on the above situation, I suggest that relevant departments should earnestly do this work and educate pig farmers to keep their pigs penned up.

    养猪必须修圈
    看了人民日报11月18日二版所登载的“养猪不可不修圈”一文，结合我们地区的情形，使我更感到养猪修圈的必要。
    在河南信阳至叶家集这一条长达二百多公里的公路，两旁居民所养牲畜大多无圈。牲畜在公路上来往横窜无人管，猪粪到处皆有。往往因牲畜乱窜，驾驶员没有注意到而被轧死。于是群众便拦车不让走，时常发生纠纷。仅今年1月至11月份共轧死猪八十六头，牛三条。就以每头猪粪增产粮食二百斤计算，损失这八十六头猪的肥料就少增产粮一万七千斤，其他损失还不算。根据以上情况，建议有关部门要认真做好这一工作，教育养猪户把猪圈起来。
