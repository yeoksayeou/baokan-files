    Unforgettable People
    I am a young translator who has worked with many Soviet experts. I constantly feel their enthusiasm for helping our country's construction.
    My first Soviet partner, Engineer Shevchenko, told me that when his wife heard he would be separated from her for a long time, she cried. But when she heard it was to go to China, she immediately smiled again, with tears of joy in her eyes.
    My second Soviet partner, Expert Gushev, told me that when he received the order to come to China, he was so happy that he didn't sleep for three nights, as if he had received the highest award. Because in the Soviet Union, everyone knows that the government sends the best workers to help the construction of brotherly countries.
    My third Soviet partner, Comrade Goryunov, excitedly picked up a strong and sturdy young man on the construction site and kissed him warmly on the cheek, saying, "Fantastic, you're practically a little tiger! You will overcome all difficulties to build your socialist motherland!"
    My fourth Soviet partner was a man named Dmitryev with considerable literary cultivation. One moonlit night on a holiday, he suddenly recited four lines of Russian poetry, and then praised, "What a vivid scene the poet Li Bai depicted!" I thought he was praising a Russian poet! But on closer thought, I realized that these were Russian translated lines of "Before my bed, the moon is shining bright, I suspect it is frost on the ground. I raise my head to look at the bright moon, I lower my head and think of my hometown," and I couldn't help but chuckle.
    Look at their great internationalist spirit, their selfless love for the newborn brotherly country! They came so quietly with joy, devoted themselves to diligent and selfless labor, and then quietly left with joy in their hearts. (Bai Ning)

    难忘的人们
    我是一个年青的翻译工作者，曾伴随着许多苏联专家工作，我随时都感觉到他们帮助我国建设的热情。
    我的第一个苏联伙伴舍甫琴柯工程师告诉我，他的妻子听说他要长时间和她分别的时候，她哭了，但是当她听说是到中国来，她立刻又笑了，眼中闪耀着喜悦的泪花。
    我的第二个苏联伙伴古雪夫专家告诉我，当他接到调来中国的命令时，他欢喜得三个晚上没有睡觉，仿佛自己受到了最高的奖赏。因为在苏联谁都知道：政府是把最优秀的工作者派去帮助兄弟国家的建设的。
    我的第三个苏联伙伴葛良斯诺夫同志在工地上兴奋地抱起了一个又粗又壮的小伙子，热烈地吻着他的面颊说：“了不得，你简直是个小老虎！你会克服一切困难去建设你的社会主义祖国！”
    我的第四个苏联伙伴，是一个文学修养相当高的名叫季米特里也夫的人。在一个假日的月夜，他忽然朗诵了四句俄文诗，然后赞美道“诗人李白描绘出了多么生动的情景啊！”我还以为他在赞美一个俄罗斯诗人呢！但仔细一想，原来这正是“床前明月光，疑是地上霜，举头望明月，低头思故乡”的俄译诗句，不禁哑然失笑了。
    请看他们伟大的国际主义的胸怀，他们对新生的兄弟国家无私的爱吧！他们是那么满怀喜悦地悄悄而来，付出一番辛勤的、忘我的劳动以后，又带着满怀喜悦的心情悄悄而去。　（白宁）
