(Dispatch from our newspaper) The manure collection campaign in Hebei Province has gradually unfolded from key points to the whole area. Statistics up to mid-November show that the province has collected over 80 billion catties of fertilizer. Leaders at all levels, while focusing on water conservancy, have also emphasized manure collection. Each special district has formulated plans to increase fertilizer collection. For example, the CPC Shijiazhuang Prefectural Committee recently held a telephone conference requiring that the amount of fertilizer applied in the central and western regions next spring should increase by one-third to two-thirds on the existing basis, and the amount of fertilizer applied in the eastern region should be doubled. In Baoding Special District, eleven counties including Mancheng plan to exceed the special district's requirements for manure collection this winter and next spring.

Generally, areas promote the development of the manure collection campaign by cultivating key points, creating models, summarizing experiences, and organizing visits. Eleven counties including Yutian, Jiaohe, Dongguang, and Mancheng have established more than 300 key points for various types of manure collection. Jiaohe, Dongguang, and other six counties have also organized more than 3,000 commune and team cadres and activists to study and visit the key experience. A manure collection upsurge has formed in many areas. Incomplete statistics from Cangxian and Baoding Special Districts show that more than 760,000 people are involved in manure collection every day, accounting for 30% of the total labor force. Currently, rural water conservancy construction, wheat field management, and various work tasks are heavy, requiring a lot of labor. Many agricultural cooperatives, by rationally organizing labor and utilizing all auxiliary labor, have achieved good results in manure collection. Of the more than 70,000 people involved in manure collection in Mengcun, Nanpi, and Fucheng counties, women account for 56%. Many agricultural cooperatives have focused on summarizing the experience of increasing fertilizer and increasing production in previous years and have formulated fertilizer increase plans for next year.

    河北积肥运动将形成高潮
    组织辅助劳力积肥效果很好
    本报讯　河北省积肥运动已由点到面逐步展开，到11月中旬统计，全省已积肥八百多亿斤。各级领导在突出抓紧水利的同时，重视了积肥工作。各个专区都制定了增积肥料的计划。例如中共石家庄地委最近召开了电话会议要求中部和西部地区明春的施肥量要在现有基础上增加三分之一到三分之二，东部地区的施肥量要翻一翻。保定专区满城等十一个县今冬明春计划积肥数字超过了专区要求。
    一般地区都通过培养重点，搞样版的方法，进行总结经验，组织参观，以推动积肥运动的开展。玉田、交河、东光、满城等十一个县就搞了各类积肥重点三百多个。交河、东光等六个县并组织了三千多名社、队干部和积极分子学习和参观了重点经验。许多地区积肥已形成热潮。沧县、保定两专区不完全统计，每天有七十六万多人投入积肥，占劳力总数的30％。当前农村水利建设，麦田管理，各项工作任务很重，需用劳力很多。许多农业社由于合理组织劳力，发挥了所有辅助劳力的作用，积肥开展的很好。孟村、南皮、阜城三县投入积肥的七万多人，其中妇女占56％。不少农业社着重总结了历年增肥增产的经验，制定了明年的增肥计划。
