Xinhua News Agency, New York, October 31st: TASS, New York, October 31st—The United Nations General Assembly Political Committee's morning session on October 31st began discussing draft resolutions submitted by various delegations during the general discussion on disarmament issues. A total of ten draft resolutions were submitted to the committee for discussion. Three of these concerned the cessation of atomic weapons testing, namely: the Soviet delegation's draft proposal calling for the cessation of all atomic and hydrogen weapon tests for two or three years, starting on January 1, 1958; the Indian proposal calling on countries possessing atomic weapons to cease testing and suggesting the establishment of a technical committee to formulate a system for monitoring the implementation of this measure; and the Japanese proposal stipulating a short-term trial cessation of nuclear weapons testing (until the next session of the United Nations General Assembly) while implementing other recommendations.

The Soviet delegation's draft resolution called on countries possessing nuclear weapons to undertake an obligation not to use atomic and hydrogen weapons for five years, after which the United Nations would discuss the issue again.

Three draft resolutions concern general recommendations from the United Nations Disarmament Commission. One of these is the so-called "Twenty-Four Nation Draft" proposed by Western countries. This draft actually supports the position taken by Western countries during the London negotiations. The draft lists six partial disarmament measures, but the implementation of each point is conditional on reaching an agreement on all other points. The draft makes no mention of banning the use of nuclear weapons, not even as a distant goal.

India's draft resolution seeks to reconcile differing views among various proposals.

A draft resolution submitted by Yugoslavia clarifies several principles, requiring members of the United Nations Disarmament Commission Subcommittee to reach an agreement on partial disarmament measures based on these principles.

Two draft resolutions—proposed by the Soviet Union and India—call for changing the United Nations bodies dealing with disarmament issues. The Soviet draft resolution suggests establishing a permanent United Nations Disarmament Committee composed of all United Nations member states. This committee should study all disarmament-related proposals submitted to the United Nations and formulate relevant recommendations to be submitted to the United Nations General Assembly. After the establishment of this permanent committee, the existing Disarmament Commission and its subcommittee should be abolished.

India's draft resolution proposes expanding the membership of the United Nations Disarmament Commission and its subcommittee.

The Political Committee also discussed a draft resolution proposed by Belgium calling for collective action based on the world opinion's demand to pay attention to the dangers of the arms race.

Yugoslav Representative Prica was the first to speak at the October 31st meeting. When discussing the Western countries' one-sided draft resolution, he emphasized that passing such a draft resolution by a majority vote could only lead to further aggravation of international relations, and only unanimously adopted resolutions could achieve progress in disarmament.

Prior to this, the Political Committee concluded the general debate on disarmament issues on October 30th, with representatives from India, the Soviet Union, and France speaking.

Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Kuznetsov criticized the Western countries' consistent back-and-forth attitude on disarmament issues and used irrefutable facts to prove that the United States, Britain, and France oppose the prohibition of nuclear weapons, oppose the cessation of manufacturing nuclear weapons, and oppose the elimination of nuclear weapons from the armaments of various countries.

The Soviet representative pointed out that the Western countries' "Twenty-Four Nation Proposal" cannot serve as the basis for a disarmament agreement, and it is yet another useless resolution.

Indian Representative Menon called for an immediate halt to atomic testing at the meeting. He opposed the view that unanimity was not necessary on disarmament issues, and he noted that he regretted that French Representative Moch had told the General Assembly to abandon the idea of reaching unanimous agreement on disarmament issues. Menon also expressed opposition to the passage of the Western Twenty-Four Nation Proposal.

### 联大开始讨论各种裁军提案  苏印南等国代表反对西方建议

    联大开始讨论各种裁军提案
    苏印南等国代表反对西方建议
    据新华社1日讯　塔斯社纽约31日讯：联合国大会政治委员会10月31日上午会议开始讨论各国代表团在裁军问题一般性讨论中提出的决议草案。提交委员会讨论的草案共十个。其中有三个是关于停止试验原子武器的，即苏联代表团提出的从1958年1月1日开始在两年或三年内停止一切原子武器和氢武器试验的草案；印度提出的号召拥有原子武器的国家停止试验并建议成立技术委员会制订监督实行这一措施的制度的草案；日本提出的规定在实行其他建议的同时，短期（到下一届联合国大会开会时为止）试行停止核武器试验的草案。
    苏联代表团提出的决议草案号召拥有核武器的国家承担在五年内不使用原子武器和氢武器的义务，在五年期满后再由联合国来讨论这个问题。
    有三个决议草案是关于联合国裁军委员会一般性建议的。其中有一个是西方国家提出的所谓“二十四国草案”。这个草案实际上是支持西方国家在伦敦谈判时采取的立场。这个草案举出六点局部裁军措施，但是要实行每一点，都必须以其他各点达成协议为先决条件。这个草案没有提到禁止使用核武器，那怕是把它作为遥远的目标也没有。
    印度的决议草案是想调和各种建议中的不同观点。
    南斯拉夫提出的一项决议草案阐明了几项原则，要求联合国裁军委员会小组委员会的成员根据这些原则达成关于裁军的局部措施的协议。
    有两个决议草案——苏联和印度提出的——要求改变处理裁军问题的联合国机构。苏联提出的决议草案建议成立一个由所有联合国会员国参加的联合国常设裁军委员会。这个委员会应该研究向联合国提出的所有有关裁军的建议，并且拟定向联合国大会提出的有关建议。在这个常设委员会成立之后，现有的裁军委员会及其小组委员会应该撤消。
    印度的决议草案提出要扩大联合国裁军委员会及其小组委员会的成员。
    政治委员会还讨论比利时提出的根据世界舆论要求注意军备竞赛危险性的呼吁而采取集体行动的决议草案。
    南斯拉夫代表普里察在31日会议上第一个发言。他谈到西方国家的片面性的决议草案时强调说，以多数表决来通过这种决议草案只能导致国际关系的进一步尖锐化，只有一致通过的决议才能使裁军方面获得进展。
    在这之前，政治委员会10月30日结束了裁军问题的一般性辩论，发言的有印度、苏联和法国的代表。
    苏联外交部副部长库兹涅佐夫抨击西方国家在裁军问题上一贯的出尔反尔态度，并且用无可反驳的事实证明，美、英、法反对禁止核武器，反对停止制造核武器和从各国军备中取缔核武器。
    苏联代表指出西方国家的“二十四国提案”不能作为裁军协定的基础，这是又一个毫无好处的决议。
    印度代表梅农在会上要求立即停止原子核试验。他反对在裁军问题上不必取得一致意见的主张，他指出，他对法国代表莫克告诉大会放弃在裁军问题上取得一致通过的想法表示遗憾。梅农还表示反对通过西方二十四国提案。
