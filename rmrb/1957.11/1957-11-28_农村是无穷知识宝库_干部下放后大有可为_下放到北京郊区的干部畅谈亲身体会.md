The newspaper reports: "After cadres are sent down, do they really have a future?" "Do peasants have anything worth learning for intellectuals?" "Can they get used to the harsh life in the countryside?" "Can they really do manual labor?" These are the questions that many people are very concerned about. The reporter recently interviewed some of the cadres who were sent down to the suburbs of Beijing on these three questions, and got affirmative answers from their talks.

	Not without a future,
	But with great potential
Some people once thought: "After the cadres are sent down, they will fall behind and have no future." Many cadres who have been sent down use the facts to show that cadres sent down to the countryside are not without a future, but have great potential. Ren Baoqin, a cadre from the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau who was sent down to Yuegezhuang Township in Fengtai District, is a young intellectual who graduated from school after liberation. After leaving school, he went to the agency and never engaged in physical labor. Although he has only been down for two months, he has deeply realized that the countryside needs a large number of educated youths to engage in agricultural labor. He told reporters: "When I and the farmers dug vegetable cellars and built sun-facing seedbeds together, the old farmers had a wealth of experience on how to dig vegetable cellars and how to build sun-facing seedbeds; however, due to the limitation of the farmers' cultural level, these valuable experiences have not been summarized and improved, which affects the continued improvement and development of production. I think that my main task now is to learn labor and become familiar with labor. When I have learned and become familiar, I can help farmers study and summarize these experiences, which will be of great benefit to the development of agricultural production. In the countryside, I can not only learn production knowledge from the old farmers, but also apply my own knowledge to production. Therefore, with the continuous development of agricultural production, I will surely be continuously improved. A foreign reporter once asked me: How many years do you have to work? My answer is: Time is not a problem for me, because this land needs me, and I can also learn things here. I want to use my hands to build a new countryside. And after I learn to work, I can go to more remote mountainous areas to reclaim wasteland in the future."
	In Dongran Village Township, the reporter interviewed Wang Dongguang, a cadre who was sent down. Wang Dongguang was originally an agricultural technician. He excitedly told reporters: "In the past, I went to wherever there was experience to summarize, and I was a technician who 'only talked and didn't practice'; now I can concretize my past book knowledge through personal practice, and at the same time I can apply my book knowledge to practice, so I understand many problems more specifically and deeply, which strengthens my idea of serving agriculture for life." Now, in addition to participating in labor with the commune members, Wang Dongguang makes a chart record for every farm work he does, and studies book knowledge related to current production early and late. After his continuous study and research, he found that some rice fields in the brigade where he was located had impure rice seeds, and the cabbage was also a hybrid. He helped the team re-select the good seeds.
	A large number of young intellectuals from Renmin University who were sent down to the Sino-Czech Friendship Agricultural Cooperative were deeply encouraged by the beautiful vision of the countryside. Many people are willing to settle down in the countryside for a long time. According to Zhai Liangchao, the person in charge of the cadres sent down from Renmin University to the Sino-Czech Friendship Cooperative, the Sino-Czech Friendship Cooperative is surrounded by mountains and rivers, but before liberation, the mountains were barren mountains and the land was dry land, and the lives of the peasants were very hard. After liberation, especially since the establishment of the Sino-Czech Friendship Cooperative, with the help of the Party and the government and Czechoslovakia, this large cooperative with more than 9,000 people and more than 24,300 mu of land has 700 mu of irrigated land, one car, three tractors, 120 large carts and more than 1,000 new farm tools. Last year, many commune members had a monthly income of about 40 or 50 yuan. This year will increase even more. At present, the cooperative is concentrating a lot of effort on water conservancy construction. They plan to use the Yongding River water to "draw water up the mountains and let the water flow by itself" within a few years, and turn more than 10,000 mu of dry land into irrigated land, and they also plan to build a hydropower station. The current ongoing work of repairing canals and digging wells alone will increase the irrigated land to 5,000 mu after completion next spring. This year, the cooperative has planted tens of thousands of various fruit trees. At present, the nursery is still cultivating tens of thousands of fruit tree seedlings such as peaches, pears, and apples, which will also be planted on various hillsides next spring. The mountain pastures for grazing livestock have also been planned. In terms of the cultural life of the peasants, the cooperative is vigorously carrying out literacy work, and a plan for the establishment of a peasant spare-time middle school has also been drafted. Zhai Liangchao said that in a few years, the appearance of this cooperative will also be greatly changed. At that time, it will become a good place to "eat apples when you look up and pick peanuts when you look down." To realize such a vision, new-style farmers with knowledge are needed. Therefore, socialist agriculture not only expands the ideal realm of intellectuals, but also opens up a new place for them to contribute to the socialist cause.

	Peasants not only have things to learn
	But there are many things to learn
Some people also think: Peasants have no culture, and agricultural labor only requires effort. What is there to learn? Many conversations between cadres sent down and reporters show that this view is wrong. Lu Guo, a cadre from the Municipal Women's Federation who was sent down, said: In terms of agricultural labor alone, peasants have countless places worth learning from us. Take the simplest cotton picking as an example! It seems that just picking the cotton from the branches is enough, but when we went to pick it at the beginning, our hands were clumsy, and it took a long time to pick one. What about the farmers? They can grab it with their hands and it will come down easily. Duan Ruijin, a cadre sent down from Dongran Village Township, said: I have now initially learned to do some simple farm work, but any small operation is learned from the farmers. Therefore, he believes that if he does not humbly learn from the farmers after being sent down, he will accomplish nothing.
	In fact, peasants not only have many things worth learning from the cadres sent down in terms of production knowledge, but also have many things worth learning in terms of moral character and knowledge of class struggle. Comrade Liu Shoupeng (former deputy secretary of the Party Committee of Renmin University), who was sent down to the Junmin Friendship Cooperative in Fengtai District, told reporters: The peasants' loyal, straightforward, hardworking, and thrifty qualities often move me. For example, once, a comrade from Renmin University pulled radishes and was tired, so he didn't pull them by hand, but kicked them with his feet. After a farmer saw it, he said seriously but kindly: "If the skin is broken, it won't last, which will affect the income of the commune members." Before "Minor Snow," in order to prevent the cabbage from freezing, the leaders of the Junmin Friendship Cooperative called on all commune members to participate in the emergency harvesting. That night, elementary school students and old farmers in their sixties all participated in the emergency harvesting.
	The simple life of the peasants also has a profound impact on the cadres sent down. When talking about this issue, Comrade Liu Shoupeng took himself as an example and said meaningfully: In the past, in the school, we senior intellectuals ate in small canteens, which was much higher than the lives of the peasants. But whenever the alkali in the steamed buns was a little too much, or the stir-fried dishes were slightly undercooked, we were dissatisfied and picked on them everywhere. When we saw the simple life of the peasants with our own eyes, we naturally felt that this phenomenon was very wrong. For example, in the past, in order to make it convenient for ourselves to eat fruits and snacks, we asked the general affairs office for bedside tables. The bedside tables sent by the general affairs office were not very good-looking, so we didn't want them. Now it seems, how excessive this is!
	The actual life in the countryside also made the comrades of Renmin University discover the shortcomings in the past teaching work. The teachers of the Department of Economics, when talking about socialist agriculture in the past, had unrealistic aspects in terms of labor organization and distribution. For example, some people confused work points and work days. After this period of labor, the comrades also had a concrete rather than abstract understanding of the issue of labor creating the world. Some people said that when they go back to teach this course, they will no longer make people feel that it is dogmatic. As long as you realize the meaning of labor, you will feel "joy in hardship"
Some cadres sent down, especially those who were born as intellectuals, believe that they have never worked before, never lived in the countryside, and whether they can engage in agricultural labor all of a sudden, whether they will be exhausted, and whether they can get used to the hard life in the countryside? The conversations of many cadres sent down prove that this concern is unnecessary. The person in charge of the cadres sent down from Tsinghua University in the Nanyuan Agricultural Cooperative told reporters: Most of them were intellectuals who "do not use their limbs and do not distinguish between the five grains," but after a period of labor training, some people can not only participate in labor, but also their labor efficiency and labor quality can catch up with the level of ordinary commune members. People who participate in labor are not only not exhausted, but also healthier. Bai Dazun, a cadre sent down from the school, concretized what the person in charge said. He said: His health was not very good when he was in the agency. When he was sent down this time, many commune members said that he had a pale complexion and looked like a frail scholar. How could he work? But he did not lose heart and was determined to exercise. When harvesting rice, he bent over to harvest and his waist was sore, so he squatted to harvest. When his legs hurt, he knelt to harvest. When he really couldn't do it, he rested for a while and then continued to work. He asked the peasants for advice whenever he didn't understand. He worked like this day after day, and after a week, he was not so tired, and he was familiar with the work. At the beginning, he could only earn four or five points a day, but now he can earn about ten points. Not only that, his health is much better than when he was at school. In the past, he always had to ask for a few days off due to illness every month, but now he has not been absent for a day in a month, and his complexion has changed from pale to dark and red. He said he felt very happy and joyful.
	Because they are determined to exercise from labor, they believe that life in the countryside is more difficult than life in the city, but as long as they can recognize the great significance of participating in agricultural labor, they will feel "joy in hardship" and will naturally get used to it. Duan Ruijin, a cadre who has always been engaged in cultural and educational work in Dongran Village Township, said: Like us, who have never lived in the countryside, we will of course feel unaccustomed when we first arrive in the countryside. When I first came down, I felt that there were no foreign houses, no running water, no transportation, and everything in terms of clothing, food, housing, and transportation had changed. In addition, I had to work and deal with soil all day long, and I felt awkward everywhere. However, I thought: This is training, this is a test, and intellectuals must be trained in this. After returning from work every day, I pick up a cornbread and a bowl of cabbage soup, and I always feel that it is sweet and fragrant. I think if you can solve the problem ideologically, you will feel "joy in hardship." Fan Li, a cadre from the Beijing Cultural and Sporting Goods Company who was sent down to the Jinxing Agricultural Cooperative, told reporters: Although today's countryside is more difficult than today's city life, it is truly joyful compared to the past countryside. Before liberation, I participated in voluntary labor in the countryside of Yan'an for more than ten days. The countryside was really hard at that time! The peasants ate corn paste and had no money to buy chopsticks, so they used Artemisia stalks as chopsticks. What about now? I have been down for more than a month, and I eat at the homes of the folks, and every meal is cabbage and tofu, and I am full.

### 农村是无穷知识宝库　干部下放后大有可为  下放到北京郊区的干部畅谈亲身体会

    农村是无穷知识宝库　干部下放后大有可为
    下放到北京郊区的干部畅谈亲身体会
    本报讯　“干部下放以后究竟有没有前途？”“农民有没有值得知识分子学习的地方？”“能不能习惯农村的艰苦生活？”“究竟能不能劳动？”这是当前许多人非常关心的问题。记者最近就这三个问题访问了北京市郊区的一些下放干部，从他们的谈话中，得到了肯定的回答。
      不是没有前途
      而是大有可为
    曾有一些人认为：“干部下放以后，就要落后了，没有前途了”。许多下放干部用事实说明：干部下放到农村不是没有前途，而是大有可为。北京市公安局下放到丰台区岳各庄乡的干部任保芹，是解放以后才从学校毕业的青年知识分子。他走出学校，就进了机关，从来没有从事过体力劳动。他虽然下去才两个月，但已深深体会到农村需要大批知识青年去从事农业劳动。他对记者说：“我和农民一齐挖菜窖，打阳畦时，菜窖究竟如何挖？阳畦如何打？老农都有着一套丰富的经验；但是，农民由于文化水平的限制，对这些宝贵的经验都没有加以总结、提高，这就影响到生产的继续提高和发展。我想，我现在主要是学会劳动，熟悉劳动，等我学会了，熟悉了，我就可以帮助农民研究、总结这些经验，这样，对农业生产的发展会有很大好处。在农村我既可以向老农学习生产知识，又可以将自己的知识用于生产，因此，随着农业生产的不断发展，我自己一定也会得到不断的提高。一个外国记者曾问我：要劳动多少年？我的回答是：时间对我不是个问题，因为这片土地上需要我，我也可以在这里学到东西，我要用我的双手建设新农村。而且我学会了劳动，将来还可以到更远的山区去开荒。”
    在东冉村乡，记者访问了下放干部王东光。王东光本来是一个农业技术人员，他兴奋地对记者说：“过去是哪儿有经验，就到哪儿去总结，是‘只说不练’的技术员；现在可以从亲身实践中，把自己过去的书本知识具体化，同时又可以把书本知识用于实践，所以对于许多问题了解得更加具体，更加深刻了，这就更加坚定了自己一生为农业服务的思想。”现在，王东光除和社员一齐参加劳动以外，每干一个农活，都做一个图表记载，并且起早带晚学习和当前生产有关的书本知识。经过他不断学习、研究以后，他发现他所在的那个大队有些稻田的稻种不纯，白菜也是杂种的，他就帮助队里重新选了良种。
    人民大学下放到中捷友好农业社的大批年青知识分子，深深为农村美丽的远景所鼓舞，许多人愿意长期在农村安家落户。据中捷友好社人民大学下放干部的负责人翟良超对记者说：中捷友好社虽然依山傍水，但在解放前山是荒山，地是旱地，农民的生活很苦。解放以后，特别是从成立中捷友好社以来，农民们在党和政府以及捷克斯洛伐克的帮助之下，现在这个拥有九千多人口和两万四千三百多亩土地的大社，已经有七百亩水浇地、一辆汽车、三台拖拉机、一百二十辆大车和一千多件新式农具。去年，有不少社员每月收入达四、五十元左右。今年还要增加。目前，这个社正在集中很大的力量兴修水利。他们准备利用永定河水，在数年之内“引水上山、引水自流”，把一万多亩旱地变成水浇地，并且准备兴建水电站。单是目前正在进行的修渠打井工作，待明春完工后，水浇地就可以增加到五千亩了。今年，这个社已经栽种了上万株各种水果树。现在，苗圃里还在培育着数以万计的桃、梨、苹果等果树苗，来年春天也要栽种在各个山坡上。放养牲畜的山地牧场，也已经规划好了。在农民的文化生活方面，社里正在大力进行扫盲工作，一个农民业余中学的创办计划也草拟好了。翟良超说，几年以后，这个社的面貌也要大大地改观。到时候，这里就会变成一个“抬头吃苹果，低头拣花生”的好地方。而要实现这样的远景，是需要有知识的新式农民的。因此，社会主义的农业，不但扩大了知识分子的理想境界，也为他们开辟了一个新的为社会主义事业贡献力量的场所。
    农民不仅有东西可学
    而且可学的东西很多
    还有些人认为：农民没有文化，农业劳动也只要卖力气就行了，这有什么可以学习的呢？许多下放干部和记者的谈话，都说明这个看法是错误的。市妇联下放干部吕果说：仅仅农业劳动这一项，农民就有无数地方值得我们学习。比如最简单的摘棉花吧！看起来把棉花从枝上摘下来就行了，可是开始我们去摘的时候，手就是笨，好一会儿才能摘一个。农民呢？用手轻轻一抓就下来了。东冉村乡下放干部段瑞金说：我现在初步学会干一些简单的农活，但是，任何一个细小的操作都是向农民学来的，因此，他认为：下放后，如不虚心向农民学习，就会一事无成。
    其实，农民何止在生产知识方面有许多东西值得下放干部学习，在道德品质、阶级斗争知识方面还有不少东西值得学习。人民大学下放到丰台区军民友谊社的刘寿彭同志（前人民大学党委副书记）对记者说：农民忠厚、率直勤劳、俭朴的品质往往使我感动。比如有一次，人民大学的一个同志拔萝卜拔累了，就不用手拔，用脚踢。一个农民看见以后，严肃地但又是亲切地说：“皮踢破了就放不住了，这会影响社员收入的。”在“小雪”前，军民友谊社为了防止冻坏白菜，社领导上就号召所有的社员参加抢收，那天晚上，小学生、六十多岁的老农民，都参加了抢收。
    农民的简朴生活，对下放干部也有着深刻的影响。谈到这个问题时，刘寿彭同志以自己为例。意味深长地说：过去在学校里，我们这些高级知识分子吃小灶，比农民的生活是高得很多的。但是每当馒头的碱大一点，炒的菜略微欠点火，就感到不满意，处处挑眼。当我们亲眼看到农民的简朴生活以后，就很自然地感到这种现象是非常不应该的。再比如，过去为了自己吃水果、零食方便，就向总务处要床头柜。总务处送来的床头柜样子不太好看，自己就不要。现在看来，这多么过分呵！
    农村的实际生活，还使人民大学的同志们发现了过去教学工作中的缺点。经济系的教员，过去在讲社会主义的农业时，对劳动力的组织、分配等方面，就有过不切实际的地方。比如，有人对工分和劳动日就混淆不清。经过这段劳动后，同志们对于劳动创造世界的问题，也有了具体的而不是抽象的体会。有人说，他们再回去讲这门课时，再也不会使人感到是教条主义了。只要认识到劳动的意义就会感到“苦中有乐”
    有些下放干部特别是知识分子出身的下放干部认为：自己过去从来没有劳动过，从来没有在农村生活过，一下子去搞农业劳动，是否劳动得下来？是否会累坏了身体？是否能过惯农村的艰苦生活？许多下放干部的谈话，证明这种顾虑是多余的。南苑农业社的清华大学下放干部负责人告诉记者：他们这次下放的大部分是“四肢不勤，五谷不分”的知识分子，但是经过一定时期的劳动锻炼以后，有些人不仅能够参加劳动，而且劳动效率和劳动质量都能赶得上一般社员水平。参加劳动的人，不仅没有累坏身体，而且更加健康了。该校下放干部白大尊把这位负责同志的话具体化了。他说：他原来在机关里身体不怎么好，这次下放时，也曾有不少社员说他面色白白的，文绉绉的书生样子，怎么能劳动？可是他没有灰心，下决心锻炼，割稻时，弯着腰割得腰酸了，就蹲着割，蹲得腿疼了，就跪着割，实在不行，休息一会儿再干。有不懂的随时请教农民，这样一天天干下去，一个礼拜以后，也就不怎么累了，活计也熟悉了。开始时，每天只能挣四分、五分的，现在已可挣十分左右了。不仅如此，身体比在校时好多了，过去一个月里总要因病请几天假，现在下来一个月，一天也没有缺勤，脸色由苍白变成又黑又红，他说他感到万分幸福，愉快。
    由于他们下决心从劳动中锻炼，因此，他们认为：农村生活比城市生活是要艰苦一些，但是只要能够认识到参加农业劳动的重大意义后，就会感到“苦中有乐”，也就自然会习惯起来。东冉村乡一向从事文教工作的下放干部段瑞金说：像咱们一伙人，从来没有在农村生活过，乍到农村，当然会感到不习惯。我初下来，就感到农村没有洋房，没有自来水，没有交通工具，衣、食、住、行那一样都发生了变化，加上还要劳动，成天和土打交道，处处感到怪蹩扭的。可是，我想：这就是锻练，就是考验，知识分子就是要在这当中锻练。每天劳动回来以后，拿起一个窝窝头，端起一碗白菜汤，吃起来总觉得又甜又香。我认为如果思想上能解决问题，就会感到“苦中有乐”。北京市文化用品公司下放到金星农业社的干部范黎对记者说：今天的农村比起今天城市的生活，虽苦一些，但是如果比起过去的农村，那真是乐中又乐。解放前，我曾在延安农村参加过十几天的义务劳动，那时农村才真苦呢！农民吃的是玉米糊，没钱买筷子，拿蒿子杆当筷子。现在呢？我下去了一个多月了，在老乡家里吃，那一顿都是又是白菜，又是豆腐，吃得饱饱的。
