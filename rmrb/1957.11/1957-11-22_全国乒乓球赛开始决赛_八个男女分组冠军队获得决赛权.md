National Table Tennis Championships Begin Finals
Eight Men's and Women's Group Champion Teams Qualify for Finals

(Our newspaper's report) The men's and women's team events of the 1957 National Table Tennis Championships, after 210 matches over the past five days, have produced the champions of the eight groups. In the four men's groups, Beijing First Team, Shanghai Second Team, and Guangdong First Team all secured group championships with a record of seven wins and no losses. Shanghai First Team won their group championship with six wins and no losses (this group had only seven teams).

In the women's four groups, Guangdong First Team, Beijing First Team, and Liaoning Team all secured group championships with a record of seven wins and no losses. In another group, Beijing Second Team, Guangdong Second Team, and Guangxi Second Team all had records of six wins and one loss. Beijing Second Team only secured the group championship due to a greater number of games won overall.

In this men's and women's team competition, many newcomers with considerable technical skill have emerged, and they have unexpectedly defeated veteran players and famous players several times during the competition. Zhuang Zedong, sixteen years old from the Beijing team, used fierce forehand and backhand shots in the competition to defeat Wen Weilang, a famous player from the Guangdong Second Team and last year's provincial champion, and veteran player Mai Rongpai. Gu Qingcui and Zhou Meizhen, two female players from Anhui Province, are only sixteen years old and are the provincial champion and runner-up, respectively. They also performed excellently in the competition. Wang Chuanqi, a young player from Shanghai First Team, defeated Liang Zhitāo from Guangdong First Team, the sixth-seeded team, by a score of 2-0 in the competition on the evening of the 21st.

The results of the eight group champions' matches in the evening were: In the women's group, Beijing First Team defeated Liaoning Team (3-1), and Beijing Second Team defeated Guangdong First Team (3-1). In the men's group, Beijing First Team defeated Shanghai Second Team (5-0), and Shanghai First Team defeated Guangdong First Team (5-3).

The champions and runners-up of the men's and women's team events will be determined after the competition on the 22nd. (Chen)
