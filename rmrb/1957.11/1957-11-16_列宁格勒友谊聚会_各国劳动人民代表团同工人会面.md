Li Fuqing, a member of the Chinese labor delegation who had once served as Lenin's guard, revisited the old site with particularly affectionate feelings.

That afternoon, the delegation visited the Admiralty Shipyard, which has a history of 250 years. The members watched with particular excitement the construction of the world's first atomic icebreaker. After the visit, Xu Guangping, the deputy head of the Chinese labor delegation, expressed her gratitude to the hosts, saying that the atomic icebreaker is the latest scientific achievement in the world. This great contribution of the Soviet Union to science once again proves that Soviet science is used to conquer nature and benefit mankind.

He said that everything we have seen in the Soviet Union in the past few days has made us extremely happy and excited.
