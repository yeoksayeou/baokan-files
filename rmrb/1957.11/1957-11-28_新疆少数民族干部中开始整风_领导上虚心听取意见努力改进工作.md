    (Reported by this newspaper) A rectification campaign among minority cadres in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region is entering the stage of full and frank airing of views. In units where the rectification campaign started earlier, such as Xinjiang University and the Uyghur language editorial department of Xinjiang Daily, the airing of views has basically concluded and is about to move into the stage of vigorous debate.
    At the beginning of the rectification campaign, minority cadres in various organs studied Comrade Deng Xiaoping's report on the rectification campaign and other rectification documents. Party and administrative leaders invited minority cadres to forums or held individual talks with them to listen to their opinions. Minority comrades in departments such as the Department of Commerce, the Department of Grain, the Bureau of Foreign Trade, and the Supply and Marketing Cooperative pointed out that there were relatively few minority cadres assigned to purchasing agents sent to inland areas and some departments. These units have replenished their ranks with ethnic minority cadres. The Urumqi Department Store added ethnic minority shops and increased the variety of ethnic minority goods. Residents of Urumqi reflected that the toilets built by some units affiliated with the Xinjiang Military Region Production and Construction Corps were too close to the canals, and the sewage discharged by food processing plants flowed into the canals, polluting the drinking water. Leading cadres of the Corps went to investigate upon receiving the residents' opinions and immediately relocated the toilets and diverted the sewage from the food processing plants elsewhere.
    However, during the airing of views, some minority cadres also released many fallacies. They slandered the Party's ethnic policies and incited ethnic discord. Various units are preparing to launch debates among ethnic minority cadres on these remarks in order to distinguish between right and wrong on major issues. At the current second meeting of the second executive committee of the Xinjiang Autonomous Region Federation of Industry and Commerce, industrialists and businessmen of all ethnic groups are criticizing Abliz Musabayev, the second manager of the Autonomous Region Industrial Comprehensive Company, for his fallacy of clamoring everywhere during the airing of views that "joint state-private ownership has messed things up."

    新疆少数民族干部中开始整风
    领导上虚心听取意见努力改进工作
    本报讯　新疆维吾尔自治区少数民族干部整风运动正在进入大鸣大放阶段。整风运动开展得较早的新疆学院、新疆日报维吾尔文编辑部等单位，鸣放已经基本结束，即将转入大辩论。
    整风运动开始时，各机关的少数民族干部学习了邓小平同志关于整风运动的报告和其他的整风文件。党和行政的领导邀请少数民族干部座谈，或者和他们个别谈话，听取他们的意见。商业厅、粮食厅、对外贸易局和供销合作总社等部门的少数民族同志提出派到关内的采购员以及某些科室，配备的少数民族干部比较少，这些单位均充实了民族干部。乌鲁木齐市百货公司增设了民族商店，增添了民族商品的品种。乌鲁木齐市居民反映，新疆军区生产建设兵团所属某些单位修建的厕所离水渠很近，食品加工厂放出的污水流入水渠，弄脏了饮水。兵团领导干部根据市民的意见，亲往调查，立刻迁移了厕所，将食品加工厂流出的污水引到别的地方。
    但是在鸣放期间，有的少数民族干部也放出了不少谬论，他们污蔑党的民族政策，挑拨民族关系。各单位准备就这些言论，在民族干部当中展开辩论，以分清大是大非。现在正在召开的自治区工商业联合会第二届执行委员会第二次会议，各族工商业者正在批判自治区工业综合公司第二经理阿布列孜·木沙巴也夫在鸣放期间到处叫嚣“公私合营搞糟了”的谬论。
