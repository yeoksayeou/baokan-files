Xinhua News Agency: Farmers in Gansu Province have launched a massive campaign to build water conservancy projects. In Pingliang and Yinchuan Special Districts and Wushan County alone, the number of people participating in water conservancy construction has reached more than 400,000.

According to preliminary statistics, in the past half month, the province has newly built more than 160,000 mu of irrigated land, and improved more than 300,000 mu of field ridges and terraced fields. Farmers in Yinchuan Special District have changed their centuries-old habit of only repairing canals in spring, and are now busily repairing canals and draining waterlogging, having newly dug and renovated more than 1,000 branch canals and dug more than 200 drainage ditches. In the relatively arid Wushan County, farmers are splitting mountains, filling gullies, and diverting water to the mountains, changing the arid landscape one gully and one canal at a time. 30,000 people in the county are participating in water conservancy construction, and have quickly built 33,000 mu of irrigated land. The county now has 160,000 mu of irrigated land, which is three times more than before liberation. This time, they are doing everything possible to find water sources and build new canals. The projects are being carried out quickly and well. In many places, canals are being opened and irrigated simultaneously, with immediate benefits.

In the past few days, more than 350 technicians and cadres from the Gansu Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau have set out from Lanzhou to guide water conservancy construction in various places. All special districts and counties have also made water conservancy construction the central task, sending out key responsible cadres and a large number of cadres.

    平凉银川两专区及武山县
    四十多万人参加修水利
    新华社讯　甘肃省农民兴修水利已出现千军万马之势。仅在平凉、银川两专区及武山县，参加修水利的人就已经达到四十多万人。
    据初步统计，全省近半月来已经新修水地十六万多亩，培地埂、修梯田三十多万亩。银川专区的农民改变了千百年来只在春季修渠的习惯，现在紧张地修渠排涝，已经新挖和整修支渠一千多条，挖排水沟二百多条。比较干旱的武山县，农民正在劈山填沟、引水上山、一沟一渠地改变着干旱面貌，全县有三万人参加兴修水利，很快修成了三万三千亩水地。这个县现已有水地十六万亩，等于解放以前的三倍。这次，他们想尽办法找水源、修新渠，所做的工程又快又好，不少地方是边开渠、边灌溉，立即发生效益。
    这几天，甘肃省水利局有三百五十多名技术人员和干部从兰州出发去各地指导兴修水利。各专区、县也都把兴修水利作为当前的中心工作，派出了主要的负责干部和大批干部。
