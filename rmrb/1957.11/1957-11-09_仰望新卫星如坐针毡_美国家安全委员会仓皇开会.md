Xinhua News Agency, 8th. Washington dispatch: Eisenhower convened the largest meeting of the National Security Council in American history on the 7th, with forty-five participants, compared to the usual twenty or so.

Fifteen scientific advisors attended the meeting. White House spokeswoman Mrs. Wheaton admitted that the meeting was related to "all the developments of the past week or ten days," including the Soviet Union's launch of the second satellite.

At the same time, some American politicians expressed doubts about whether the United States could launch a satellite. Congressman Magnuson said that the plan to launch a satellite next March was "very likely" to fail.

He said he had personally investigated the "Vanguard rocket program," and he felt that this program "was in serious trouble" and that it was "almost certain to fail."

    仰望新卫星如坐针毡
    美国家安全委员会仓皇开会
    新华社8日讯　华盛顿消息：艾森豪威尔7日召开了美国历史上最大的一次国家安全委员会会议，参加者有四十五人，而平常只有二十人左右。
    有十五名科学顾问参加了会议。白宫发言人惠吞夫人承认，会议同“上周或十天来的一切事态发展”有关，包括苏联发射第二颗卫星在内。
    同时，美国一些政界人士对美国是否能够发射卫星表示怀疑。众议员麦格讷逊说，明年3月发射卫星的计划“非常可能”会失败。
    他说，他亲自调查了“先锋火箭计划”，他觉得这个计划“陷入了严重的困难”，它“几乎肯定要失败”。
