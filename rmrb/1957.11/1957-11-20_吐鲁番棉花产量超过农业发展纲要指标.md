Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, 18th - In the Turpan Basin of Xinjiang, the average yield per unit area of cotton in Shanshan, Turpan, and Toksun counties, covering more than 163,000 mu this year, has exceeded the target of 80 jin of ginned cotton per mu, as stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft).

The fundamental reason for the bumper cotton harvest in the Turpan Basin is that the agricultural cooperatives here have conscientiously promoted the comprehensive experience of high cotton yield that has been effective locally for several years: all have adopted the high-yield cotton varieties 3173 and 8517, which are suitable for the local climate, soil, and other conditions. The advanced techniques of autumn plowing and winter irrigation, as well as a series of management techniques for cotton fields, have been implemented. In Turpan County, where the improved variety 8517 has been basically popularized, according to a comprehensive assessment, the average yield of ginned cotton per mu in the county's more than 78,000 mu of cotton fields is 85 jin, an increase of more than 25% over last year. Among them, more than 16,000 mu have an average yield per unit area exceeding 100 jin. The Pioneer Agricultural Cooperative, which has had high yields in previous years, has five mu of high-yield land, producing 486.5 jin of ginned cotton per mu, exceeding the highest target of the Agricultural Program by about four times. Shanshan County, whose cotton production has historically been lower than Turpan County, also had a unit area yield of more than 80 jin on its more than 67,000 mu of cotton fields this year. Toksun County, with its relatively poor soil, also achieved a yield of more than 71 jin of ginned cotton per mu on its more than 17,000 mu of cotton fields.

The Turpan Basin has a hot climate and is an ideal cotton-growing area in China. Since liberation, the People's Government has vigorously promoted cotton planting here. Cotton fields now account for nearly one-third of the total cultivated land area.

    吐鲁番棉花产量超过农业发展纲要指标
    新华社乌鲁木齐18日电　新疆吐鲁番盆地的鄯善、吐鲁番和托克逊三县今年十六万三千多亩棉花，平均单位面积产量已超过全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）规定每亩产皮棉八十斤的指标。
    吐鲁番盆地棉花获得大丰收的基本原因，是这里的各个农业社认真推广了几年来在当地行之有效的棉花丰产综合经验：全部采用了适合当地气候、土壤等条件的高产棉种三一七三和八五一七。推行了秋耕冬灌和一系列管理棉田的先进技术。在基本普及了八五一七良种的吐鲁番县，根据全面鉴定，全县七万八千多亩棉花平均每亩产皮棉八十五斤，比去年增产25％以上。其中有一万六千多亩平均单位面积产量超过百斤。历年高产的先锋农业社，有五亩丰产地，每亩产皮棉四百八十六点五斤，超过了农业纲要最高指标的约四倍。历来棉产低于吐鲁番县的鄯善县，今年全县六万七千多亩棉田单位面积产量也超过了八十斤，土壤瘠薄的托克逊县一万七千多亩棉花每亩产皮棉也超过了七十一斤。
    吐鲁番盆地气候炎热，是我国理想的植棉区。解放后，人民政府大力在这里提倡种棉花。现在棉田面积占全部耕地面积近三分之一。
