Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 18th. The people of Haifeng and Lufeng Counties in Guangdong Province have begun to launch various activities to warmly commemorate the thirtieth anniversary of the Hailufeng Soviet.

In the past few days, the entire Haifeng County has been filled with a festive atmosphere. Red flags were hung everywhere in Haifeng city, red lanterns were lit, and colorful archways were erected. Students sang songs from the Great Revolution era. A production upsurge was launched in the countryside to greet the thirtieth anniversary of the Hailufeng Soviet with practical actions. Members of various agricultural cooperatives strived to complete and over-fulfill the task of winter planting 285,000 mu of land and accumulating 30 dan of fertilizer per mu before the 21st, as a gift for the commemorative meeting to be held on the 21st.

On the 17th, more than 100,000 people in various parts of Lufeng County held commemorative meetings. Two thousand people participated in the commemorative activities in the county seat. Gu Dacun, Secretary of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and Deputy Governor of Guangdong Province, called on the people of Hailufeng to continue to carry forward the glorious revolutionary tradition, consolidate agricultural cooperatives, launch a large-scale production movement, and unite to overcome various difficulties and strive to realize the National Program for Agricultural Development.

Celebration meetings were also held in Jiazi, Jieshi, Bomei and other places in Lufeng County.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 18th. Leading officials of Lufeng County, Guangdong Province, announced on the 17th, while commemorating the thirtieth anniversary of the Hailufeng Soviet: The county has achieved a major victory in the struggle between the two roads. As of the 16th, more than 42,000 farmer households had rejoined agricultural cooperatives. Thus, the number of farmer households participating in cooperatives in the county has reached 87% of the total number of farmer households.

In May and June of this year, a counter-current of withdrawal and dissolution of cooperatives emerged in Lufeng County. The number of farmer households participating in agricultural cooperatives fell from 84% to 46% of the total number of farmer households, causing a large number of poor farmers to suffer capitalist exploitation again.

The poor farmers of Lufeng County, who have recognized the harm of the capitalist road, have firmly expressed their determination to run the cooperatives well in this re-organization of cooperatives. They reviewed the reasons why the cooperatives had not been run well in the past in order to improve them. In the past, in places where the dissolution and withdrawal of cooperatives were serious, the leadership of the cooperatives mostly fell into the hands of wealthy peasants. Now, the leading cadres of the new cooperatives are mostly poor and lower-middle peasants. Cadres at all levels have also improved their work style. According to the opinions of the masses, they divided the excessively large cooperatives into several smaller ones. At present, there are 1,374 cooperatives in the county, basically one cooperative per village.

Many agricultural cooperatives have also convened meetings of old peasants to study how to improve production more realistically, study how to expand winter planting, and the production enthusiasm of the members is also very high. Therefore, winter production in the county is progressing rapidly. As of the 14th, 223,711 mu had been planted, completing 55.9% of the already expanded plan, and more than 6.97 million dan of fertilizer had been accumulated.

    纪念海陆丰苏维埃三十周年
    海丰掀起生产高潮，陆丰四万农户重新入社
    据新华社广州18日电　广东省海丰县和陆丰县人民开始展开各种活动，热烈纪念海陆丰苏维埃三十周年。
    这几天，整个海丰县都洋溢着节日的气氛。海丰城内到处挂红旗，点红灯，搭彩楼。学生们唱起了大革命时代的歌曲。农村里掀起了以实际行动迎接海陆丰苏维埃三十周年的生产高潮，各个农业社的社员都争取在21日以前完成和超额完成冬种二十八万五千亩、每亩田积肥三十担的任务，以作为将在21日举行的纪念大会的献礼。
    17日，陆丰全县各地十万多人分别举行纪念会。在县城参加纪念活动的有两万人。中共广东省委书记、广东省副省长古大存号召海陆丰人民继续发扬革命光荣传统，巩固农业社，开展大生产运动，并团结一致，克服各种困难，为实现全国农业发展纲要而斗争。
    陆丰县甲子、碣石、博美等地也分别举行了庆祝会。
    据新华社广州18日电　广东省陆丰县领导机关负责人17日在纪念海陆丰苏维埃三十周年的时候宣布：全县在两条道路的斗争中已经取得了重大胜利。到16日止，已有四万二千多户农民重新加入农业社，至此，全县参加合作社的农户已占农户总数的87％。
    今年5、6月间，陆丰县曾掀起一股退社、散社的逆流，参加农业社的农户曾由占农户总数的84％下降到46％，使大批贫苦农民重新遭受资本主义的剥削。
    认清了资本主义道路的为害的陆丰县贫苦农民，在这次重新组织合作社中，都坚决表示要把合作社办好。他们检查了过去合作社办的不好的原因，以便改进。过去在散社、退社严重的地方，社的领导权大部分落在富裕农民手里，现在新社的领导干部绝大部分是贫农和下中农。各级干部也改进了工作作风。他们根据群众的意见，把过大的合作社分成几个小社，目前全县共有一千三百七十四个社，基本上是一村一社。
    许多农业社并召开老农会议，研究如何更加切合实际地搞好生产，研究如何扩大冬种，社员们的生产积极性也很高，因此全县冬季生产进展很快。到14日，已种上二十二万三千七百一十一亩，完成已经扩大的计划的55．9％，并积了六百九十七万多担肥料。
