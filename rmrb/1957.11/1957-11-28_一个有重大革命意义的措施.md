A Measure of Great Revolutionary Significance

The Chinese People's Liberation Army has begun to mobilize, in stages and batches, the dependents of officers living with the army to return to their hometowns to engage in production, find employment, settle down, and participate in the socialist construction of the countryside. According to statistics from mid-November, in fourteen units, over 20,000 households, totaling more than 36,000 dependents of officers, have already returned to their hometowns for production. In some units, the number of officer dependents returning to production has reached 81% of the total number of dependents living with the army. Now, the General Political Department of the People's Liberation Army has stipulated that "in principle, dependents of all members of the army should not reside with the army"; regarding housing, medical treatment, employment, children's schooling, and entry into nurseries for officer dependents temporarily allowed to reside with the army, the officer himself will, in principle, be responsible. At the same time, the General Political Department has also instructed the entire army that after officer dependents return to their hometowns, all officers should be educated to send money home to support their parents and raise their children, and officers are allowed to return home to visit relatives during their vacations. This measure taken by the People's Liberation Army is of great revolutionary significance.

The return of officer dependents living with the army to their hometowns for production is of great significance for our country's national defense and army building, as well as for the work and study of officers. The Chinese People's Liberation Army is an armed force that defends our country's socialist construction and defends against imperialist aggression, and it is undergoing modernization. A large number of officer dependents living with the army seriously affects the army's construction, defense, and training. For officers, having their dependents living with the army inevitably distracts them, requiring them to devote attention to their dependents' food, clothing, housing, transportation, as well as the upbringing and education of their children. This inevitably affects the completion of officers' tasks of training soldiers and studying for improvement. Therefore, mobilizing officer dependents living with the army to return to their hometowns for production will play a positive role in strengthening the modernization of the People's Liberation Army, enhancing the unity between officers and soldiers, and strengthening the relationship between the army and the people. At the same time, this measure is also conducive to the work, study, and progress of the officers themselves.

The return of officer dependents living with the army to their hometowns for production also conforms to the principle of building the army and the country through diligence and frugality. In recent years, the state has allocated a large sum of money to build a large number of residences and nurseries for officer dependents living with the army, and to add many other welfare facilities. However, due to the rapid increase in the number of officer dependents living with the army in recent years, there are still many difficulties in housing, medical care, children's schooling and entry into nurseries, and the supply of living materials. To meet the needs of the living welfare of a large number of officer dependents living with the army is not only beyond the state's financial capacity, but also violates the principle of building the army and the country through diligence and frugality. Therefore, the rational solution is to mobilize officer dependents living with the army to return to their hometowns for production, reduce the state's financial expenditure in this regard, and increase the funds for economic and cultural construction.

This measure of the People's Liberation Army arranges a reasonable and long-term future for the officer dependents living with the army who come from the countryside. Most of the officer dependents living with the army in the troops now were born in the countryside and have lived in the countryside for a long time. They are accustomed to rural life and have relatively skilled agricultural production skills. However, after they leave the countryside, they are separated from agricultural production, and they cannot find suitable work in the city and have nothing to do. This is a great distress for many officer dependents who are accustomed to working, and for agricultural production, letting these strong working women idle is a great waste. Chen Yanfen, an officer's dependent in a certain unit, said: "Before I came to the army, I was the production team leader of an agricultural cooperative, earning more than 2,000 work points every year. After coming to the army for more than a year, not only did I not produce grain, but the state had to support me. This is unreasonable." The officer dependents of a certain unit also unanimously agreed at a symposium that: Building socialism is everyone's business. Others work hard from five o'clock in the morning until midnight, but we are here idle; if rural women were all like us, who would build socialism? Now, according to the regulations of the General Political Department, they can re-enter the glorious labor front and become participants in socialist construction rather than bystanders. This not only solves the employment problem of officer dependents living with the army, but also increases income and reduces expenses. It is also of great benefit to the cultivation, education, and training of children after officer dependents return to the countryside. Therefore, this measure of the General Political Department of the People's Liberation Army also conforms to the vital interests of officers and officer dependents.

Among the officer dependents living with the army, many are Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, and activists, and they have a high degree of political awareness; among them, some have also performed meritorious service in wars and production, and served as heroes and models, and served as directors of cooperatives and captains of production teams. The return of officer dependents living with the army to their hometowns for production not only increases a production force for the countryside, but also increases a political force.

Most People's Liberation Army officer dependents living with the army realize the significance of returning to their hometowns for production for the country and their personal future, and many have happily left the army and returned to their hometowns. However, there are also a few who are reluctant to leave city life, or are unwilling to be temporarily separated from their loved ones, and therefore have resistance. For this part of the people, the People's Liberation Army has carried out in-depth political mobilization and meticulous organizational work. Experience has shown that as long as patient mobilization and education are carried out, the reasons are explained, and the great righteousness is made clear, they can obey the long-term interests of the country and understand their bright future.

Officer dependents who return to the countryside can generally immediately engage in production labor, but there are also some officer dependents who may encounter some temporary difficulties after returning to their hometowns for production due to being away from the countryside for too long, such as lack of housing or houses that need to be repaired, furniture that needs to be purchased, children who need to be transferred to schools, and even feeling unaccustomed to labor production at the beginning. Regarding these, the State Council has issued a notice requesting that local people's committees, especially those at the county (city) and township levels, should assist in solving these problems and mobilize the masses to help solve them. This is a political task of supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of revolutionary armymen and martyrs, which is of great significance for consolidating national defense, strengthening the relationship between the army and the people, and promoting the cause of rural socialist construction. Local party and government organs and agricultural cooperatives should warmly welcome officer dependents who return to their hometowns for production and help them solve difficulties in production and life.

The Chinese People's Liberation Army is the army of the people. In the past years of war, under the leadership of the Party and with the active support of the people of the whole country, they bravely fought victoriously against the enemy for the cause of liberation of the motherland and its people, and made countless great achievements. After the liberation of the mainland of China, in the cause of socialist construction of the motherland, they responded to the call of the Party and the state, actively defended the motherland, worked hard for the modernization of the army, and played an exemplary role in supporting agricultural cooperation, practicing economy, and supporting national economic construction. This time, they mobilized officer dependents to return to their hometowns for production, find employment, settle down, and participate in rural socialist construction. They have once again taken the lead and set an example for all government organs, organizations, and enterprises across the country. We hope that all these units will also follow the example of the People's Liberation Army, take practical steps in the rectification process, and mobilize those cadres' dependents who come from the countryside, live in the city, have no work, and can return to their hometowns for production to return to their hometowns for production and participate in the glorious cause of building a new socialist countryside.

### 一个有重大革命意义的措施

    一个有重大革命意义的措施
    中国人民解放军已经开始分期分批地动员随军军官家属还乡生产，劳动就业，安家落户，参加农村的社会主义建设。根据11月中旬的统计，十四个单位还乡生产的军官家属，已经有二万多户，三万六千多人。有的单位，还乡生产的军官家属，已达到随军家属总数的81％。现在，解放军总政治部规定军队“一切成员的家属原则上不能随军居住”；对允许暂时随军的军官家属的住房、治病、就业、子女入学和入托儿所等问题，原则上都由军官本人自理。同时，总政治部还指示全军，在军官家属还乡以后，要教育所有军官寄钱回家赡养父母和抚养子女，并允许军官在休假期间回家探亲。人民解放军所采取的这一措施，是具有重大革命意义的。
    随军军官家属还乡生产，对于我国的国防和建军、对于军官的工作和进修，都有重大的意义。中国人民解放军是保卫我国进行社会主义建设和防御帝国主义侵略的武装力量，它正在进行现代化的建设。大批军官家属随军居住，严重影响部队的建设、守备和训练。对于军官来说，家属随军居住，势必使军官精力分散，从家属的衣食住行到子女的抚育和教养，都须要军官分心照顾。这就必然影响军官训练士兵和学习进修的任务的完成。因此，动员随军军官家属还乡生产，对于加强人民解放军的现代化建设，增强官兵团结，密切军民关系，将起着积极的作用。同时，这一措施，也有利于军官本人的工作、学习和进步。
    随军军官家属还乡生产，也符合勤俭建军、勤俭建国的方针。几年来，国家曾拨出很大一笔钱，为随军军官家属修建了大批住宅、托儿所和增设了许多其他福利设施。但是，由于随军军官家属几年来急剧增加，住宅、就医、子女入学和入托儿所、生活资料的供应等等，仍然存在许多困难。要满足大批随军军官家属的生活福利的需要，不但国家财政力量不容许，而且也违反勤俭建军、勤俭建国的方针。因此，合理的解决办法就是动员随军军官家属还乡生产，减少国家在这方面的财政开支，而增加经济建设和文化建设的资金。
    人民解放军的这一措施，为来自农村的随军军官家属安排一个合理的远大的前途。现在部队中的随军军官家属，多数人出生在农村，长期生活在农村。她们习惯于农村生活，并有较熟练的农业生产的技能。但是，她们离开农村以后，脱离了农业生产，在城市中找不到适当的工作，无事可做。这对于许多有劳动习惯的军官家属来说，是很大的苦闷，而对于农业生产来说，让这些强壮的劳动妇女投闲置散，也是莫大的浪费。某部军官家属陈艳芬就说过：“我来部队前是农业社的生产队长，每年挣两千多工分，来到部队一年多，不但没有生产粮食，反要国家供养自己，这是不合理的。”某部的军官家属在一次座谈会上也一致认为：建设社会主义是每个人的事，别人起五更睡半夜地劳动生产，我们却在这儿闲着无事；要是农村妇女都像我们一样，社会主义由谁去建设呢？现在，根据总政治部的规定，她们就可以重新投入光荣的劳动战线上去，作一个社会主义建设的参加者而不是旁观者。这样不但随军军官家属的就业问题得到解决，而且还可以增加收入、减少开支。军官家属回到农村后，对子女的培养、教育和锻炼也是有很大好处的。因此，人民解放军总政治部的这一措施，也是符合军官和军官家属的切身利益的。
    随军军官家属之中有不少是共产党员、青年团员和积极分子，她们都有较高的政治觉悟；她们之中，有的还在战争中、生产中立过功，当过英雄和模范，当过合作社的主任和生产队的队长。随军军官家属还乡生产，这不仅是为农村增加一批生产力量，而且也是增加了一支政治力量。
    大多数人民解放军随军军官家属是认识到回乡生产对国家、对个人前途的意义的，许多人已经愉快地离开了部队，回到了家乡。但是，也有少数人，留恋城市生活，或者不愿与爱人暂时分离，因而有抵触情绪。对于这一部分人，人民解放军曾经向她们进行了深入的政治动员和细致的组织工作。经验证明，只要进行耐心的动员和教育，说明道理，晓以大义，她们是能够服从国家的长远利益，了解个人的光明前途的。
    军官家属回到农村，一般可以立即投入生产劳动，但也有一部分军官家属，由于离开农村时间过久，还乡生产后暂时可能遇到一些困难，诸如缺房住或房子要修补，家具要购买，子女要转学，甚至开始时对劳动生产感到不习惯等。对于这些，国务院已发出了通知，要求各地特别是县（市）、乡的人民委员会应该予以协助解决，并且发动群众帮助解决。这是一项拥军优属的政治任务，对于巩固国防、密切军民关系以及促进农村社会主义建设事业，都有重大的意义。地方党政机关和农业合作社应该热情地欢迎还乡生产的军官家属，并且帮助她们解决生产和生活上的困难。
    中国人民解放军是中国人民的子弟兵，在过去的战争岁月里，他们曾经在党的领导和全国人民的积极支援下，为祖国人民的解放事业，英勇地对敌人进行了胜利的战斗，立过无数丰功伟绩。全国大陆解放以后，在祖国社会主义建设事业中，他们响应党和国家的号召，积极保卫祖国，努力于军队现代化的建设，并且在支援农业合作化、厉行节约、支援国家经济建设等各方面起了模范的作用。这次动员军官家属还乡生产，劳动就业，安家落户，参加农村社会主义建设，他们又走在前面，给全国的各机关、团体和企业树立了榜样。我们希望，所有这些单位，也效法人民解放军，在整风过程中，采取切实的步骤，动员那些来自农村住在城市没有工作而又可以还乡生产的干部家属还乡生产，参加建设社会主义的新农村的光荣事业。
