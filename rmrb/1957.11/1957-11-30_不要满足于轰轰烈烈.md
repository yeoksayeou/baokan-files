    To mobilize the enthusiasm of all members of agricultural cooperatives for manure accumulation, calls and propaganda are necessary; however, relying solely on calls to action or assigning manure accumulation tasks to each production team and member is not enough. It is necessary to ensure that the members' enthusiasm for manure accumulation is sustained and continuously developed to achieve even greater results. How can the enthusiasm of members for manure accumulation be fully utilized? A key issue here is to earnestly adhere to the principle of mutual benefit and reasonably resolve the issue of compensation for members' manure accumulation.
    Currently, the sources of fertilizer for agricultural cooperatives, apart from some commercial fertilizers and the collective manure accumulation of the cooperative, largely, or even mostly, depend on the family fertilizers of the members. Therefore, whether the price paid to members for their fertilizer is reasonable has a decisive impact on whether the cooperative can obtain more and better fertilizer.
    Some cooperatives do not provide any compensation, or only very low compensation, or do not provide compensation according to the quality of the fertilizer when acquiring family fertilizers from members. This will hinder the enthusiasm of members for manure accumulation. The quality of pig manure in the Qinfeng Agricultural Cooperative was getting lower and lower, and the leading cadres could not find a way to change this situation in the past. Later, after a debate among the members, they realized the crux of the problem. Then they adjusted the manure accumulation methods and purchase prices, and the enthusiasm of the members for manure accumulation greatly increased.
    Now, the manure accumulation movement in many places has already started with great fanfare. What problems are behind this vigorous movement? What opinions do the members have? Leading cadres of rural party organizations and agricultural cooperatives in various regions need to check in a timely manner to see if the manure accumulation methods are correct and whether the fertilizer compensation is reasonable. If problems are discovered, immediately mobilize the masses to study, debate, find the causes, think of solutions, and solve the problems in a timely manner. Don't just be satisfied with "a rousing start" and stop leading with slogans of "thousands of carts and ten thousands of loads."

    不要满足于轰轰烈烈
    农业合作社要想把全体社员的积肥积极性调动起来，号召和宣传是很必要的；但是，光靠号召动员或是给每个生产队和社员规定出积肥任务，也还是不够的，必须使社员的积肥热情持久不懈地发挥出来，才能得到更大的成绩。怎样能使社员的积肥积极性得到充分发挥呢？这里面有一个关键问题，就是认真按照互利原则，合理地解决社员积肥报酬的问题。
    当前农业社的肥料来源，除部分商品肥料和社的集体积肥以外，相当一部分甚至大部分要靠社员的家庭肥料。因此，合作社要想得到又多又好的肥料，给社员的肥料代价是不是合理，有决定的作用。
    有些合作社在取得社员家庭肥料时，不给任何代价，或者只给很低的代价，或者不按肥料质量给代价，这都会妨碍社员积肥的积极性。勤丰农业合作社猪肥质量越来越低，领导干部过去也找不到改变这种情况的办法，后来经过社员一辩论，这才了解到问题症结所在，接着把积肥办法和收购价格作了调整，社员积肥积极性就大大高涨起来。
    现在，许多地方积肥运动已经轰轰烈烈地开展起来，在轰轰烈烈的背后有些什么问题？社员们有些什么意见？各地农村党组织和农业合作社的领导干部有必要及时检查一下，看看积肥办法是否对头，肥料报酬是否合理？发现了问题，立即发动群众研究、辩论，找原因，想办法，及时解决问题。不要只是满足于“轰轰烈烈”，把领导只停留在“千车万担”的口号上。
