    As early as fifteen years ago, Chairman Mao pointed out to us that the path of life for proletarian writers should be a long-term, unconditional, and wholeheartedly integrated path with the working people. We have also seen that the Soviet writers nurtured by the October Revolution took this path even earlier. Over the years, we have implemented the instructions of the Party and Chairman Mao, and learned from the Soviet experience. As a result, we have achieved significant accomplishments, and our ranks have welcomed literary talents who have emerged from the working people and the tempering of struggle. However, the achievements we have made and the situation of our ranks are far from meeting the needs of the people. Recently, the Party put forward the task of strengthening and developing the working class's own literary ranks, and the Third Plenary Session of the Party Central Committee called on us to go deep into the grassroots to participate in work and labor. Comrades Lu Dingyi and Zhou Yang's speeches at the Writers Association's meeting to oppose the Ding-Chen anti-Party clique also pointed out the specific ways for us to integrate with the working people. I believe that this series of measures by the Party is not an ordinary or temporary work instruction, but a fundamental issue raised to us in the current period of socialist construction, arranging for us a new revolutionary fighting path; This is to further resolutely implement the policy put forward by Chairman Mao fifteen years ago, and it is the path of life that our existing and future large number of proletarian writers must fundamentally solve.

    Of course, there are already a group of veteran writers in our ranks who are quite rich in experience and cultivation. They have been working hard all the time, and they are models for our country's writers. We also have some middle-aged writers who have generally embarked on the correct path of life in the past ten years according to Chairman Mao's instructions. But I also keenly feel that the way of life of a considerable part of our team has indeed had problems in recent years. Our understanding of Chairman Mao's instructions fifteen years ago is not very profound, and the implementation is not thorough. First, let's talk about the younger generation. After the national liberation, young authors who emerged from the working people, or even young authors who came from intellectuals and had little experience in struggle, often rushed to leave the grassroots or production posts after writing a few short stories, and adopted a lifestyle of going down to "experience life" and then coming back to write. This approach has led to the degeneration of some young authors and other bad consequences. Regarding the middle-aged generation, in addition to a few who have always adhered to their posts in the struggle life, others also correctly solved the path of life in combination with the masses during the war, but very few of them were truly "academic" from the working people. After the national liberation, most of them changed their past lifestyles in the war environment. Some of them lived in big cities due to work needs; Some comrades who specialize in writing, their base of struggle life is not in the city, but they also left their base and settled in big cities, only going to the so-called "life" for a short time when necessary, and then coming back to write; Some comrades even have no fixed base of life, but they also stay in big cities in this way. This way of life naturally also affects the above-mentioned young writers. Although this approach is suitable for some middle-aged and older writers, it is definitely not suitable for others, such as myself; Because this is not a way to thoroughly implement the instructions of the Party and Chairman Mao and fundamentally solve the path of life of proletarian writers. The recent call of the Party is precisely a timely and wise measure aimed at these situations.

    I unconditionally respond to the Party's recent call and prepare to go to the countryside to participate in work. And I have not completely considered the above issues in the past. Even a year ago, I proposed to leave Beijing and go to Hebei Province to go deep into life and carry out creation. The Party approved my request this spring. However, my past thoughts are fundamentally different from my current determination and requirements. Originally, I had a long-term creative plan, and I felt that the accumulation of life to complete that plan was not enough. At the same time, because I had worked in Beijing for many years, I felt that some environments in big cities would even affect creation. Therefore, I was determined to go to the area where I had worked and which I planned to describe, to contact life and supplement materials in the short term, while focusing on writing. Now it seems that my plan has obviously not fundamentally solved the problem, and it is not much different from living in Beijing; Because just where you live sometimes cannot determine the main problem.

    I advocate that literary workers should have their own main living base. In the past, during the war, I worked in rural areas of Hebei and Shanxi for several years, and in recent years I have also worked in agricultural cooperatives in that area for a short time; The life struggle of the working people there gave me some tempering and transformation, and that place naturally became my main living base; The heroic deeds of the people there and the comrades who fought together in the past constantly urged me, making me feel uneasy if I didn't write them down. However, can I write works that are more worthy of them? According to the original plan, I seemed quite confident, as if everything was almost the same, just a short trip to supplement something and breathe a little new life. Now, after the rectification and the anti-rightist struggle, I cannot help but doubt myself. I was not born in the working class. In the past, most of the mass work was done in the office, and I rarely engaged in grassroots work and participated in labor. My own subjective efforts were not enough, and some wrong ideas grew in the urban life after the national liberation; Therefore, I deeply realized in the rectification that I am not a strong fighter of the Party and the working class, and I even feel ashamed to be called a writer. Examining my original plan from this perspective, it is precisely that I have not consciously emphasized the fundamental issue of tempering and transforming in labor struggle, as if I had already been well tempered and transformed in the past mass work and had solved the fundamental problem, and forgot the Party's teaching that we should wash our faces and look in the mirror every day. This idea itself just shows that my tempering and transformation is not enough, and explains why wrong ideas will grow after entering the city. Therefore, my current determination must first be to go to grassroots work and labor to further transform myself. Without this, any creative plan will not be guaranteed to be completed.

    Since I grew up in a city in the south and left my hometown very early, I am not familiar with my hometown, and my feelings are not as strong as Hebei, where I have worked and fought. It should be said that the choice of my main living base is appropriate. But, am I very familiar with the rural areas of Hebei and the general rural situation? I recalled the scene when I worked briefly in the rural areas of Hebei with Comrade Zhao Shuli three or four years ago. From that period of time, I clearly saw that I went to the countryside to "participate" in work and "understand" life. Although it was not too difficult to "understand," and it was still possible to get involved in "participation" in work, and even in specific work, Comrade Lao Zhao and I were not without our respective strengths and weaknesses; But the fundamental problem is that Lao Zhao did not go to the countryside to "participate" and "understand" anything, but returned to his own home, although his hometown is not in Hebei but in Shanxi. That is to say, if I competed with Comrade Zhao Shuli in a real way, no matter in terms of social knowledge, production knowledge, and the daily life and customs of the working people, in a word, in terms of the understanding of these basic knowledge that is crucial to the tempering and writing of intellectuals, I am still far behind him; That is to say, in the combination with the working people, I still have an obvious distance, and he doesn't even have to mention the combination or not. Not to mention his struggle experience in the war and earlier underground work, he planted land when he was young, did mud, wood, and tile work, drove foot, and also had a set of skills for the local Shangdang opera, and even had the talent of a rural inventor. When he encounters specific problems in rural areas, he can not only combine the actual situation in the work, but also is good at considering various kinship relations and customs. He picks up ordinary farm tools just like picking up a pen; Maybe the farm tools in Hebei and Shanxi are a little different, or even new farm tools, but he is like meeting a special style of pen, and he can master it by asking a few knowledgeable words. He can even talk fluently with local experts about oil workshops, flour workshops, canals, wells, and hillsides, and general agricultural and sideline techniques and medicinal materials and fruits. And I don't want to say anything about "expert," that is, things that I have learned and understood in the past, after a few years, I often just seem to have met them before, and I need to start from scratch to barely cope. When it comes to combining with the working people, it is really not easy to talk about! There can be no falsehood here, and it all depends on solid work. Therefore, I feel that the Party's current call is really a right remedy for me. I must not hesitate to go deep into grassroots work and labor to further temper and transform myself. And I think this is the first step in my creative practice.

    Moreover, I only participated in the mass struggle in the stage of democratic revolution in the past. Although I also went to the countryside for a short time to run cooperatives in recent years, I have not personally experienced a more comprehensive process in the development of a cooperative, and the entire production process from spring to winter in a year; I participated in collective labor even less, and the tempering of various aspects of life in rural areas after collectivization is naturally not enough. The current socialist countryside is changing rapidly, and people's lives are changing rapidly; Whether my pen touches the past or the present, leaving the experience of the present will be leaving the current pulse of the people, and will turn any brilliant pen into a bald pen. Therefore, I must not only respond to the Party's current call in temporary actions. I will completely change my past plans and seriously embark on a long-term, unconditional, and wholeheartedly integrated path with the working people.

    So, what will be the specific arrangements in the future? Because I will become a cadre in Hebei Province, I will naturally obey the distribution of the province. But I will strive to participate in specific work in a township that I am more familiar with in the past. I feel that at present, local party and government organs often consider various considerations for literary workers, but we ourselves must not ask for any special treatment in the future. Whatever work is assigned, that is what cadre we will be. We must bear all the responsibilities and work actively and hard. We must both complete the tasks and contact the masses without forcing orders. I think this is the most basic attitude to meet the risks and tests. Only in this way can we achieve sharing the fate of the people, breathing the same breath, and being connected by blood, achieve emotional exchange with the people, and be consistent with the Party's ideas; And under the supervision of the Party and the people, seek further transformation of ourselves.

    This naturally does not mean to put down the literary weapons, or even passively put them down temporarily. However, since our combination with the working people is by no means just a means to complete the writing purpose, we have an unshirkable responsibility to first and always fight with the people; And this battle itself also includes creative practice. For example, I am prepared to learn about some more comprehensive situations with the help of the Party committee during the grassroots work; And I may transfer to work in other counties and townships after a certain period of time, so as to combine the in-depth of points and the openness of areas in many aspects. Of course, I can also focus on understanding certain materials according to needs, and I can also pay attention to folk literature. It is also necessary to squeeze out time in the entire work to write features and reports for provincial and foreign newspapers and periodicals. Special writing will inevitably be carried out after a certain period of time, but in writing, we must also strive to participate in work in the short term. When encountering mass movements, we will suspend writing and participate in the movements. I envision that in the next few years, on the one hand, I will learn as much as possible about the rural situation and even other aspects, and on the other hand, I will focus on participating in the work of two or three townships, participating in their long-term plans, and being responsible for the completion of that plan for a long time. Even if I leave there, I will regard the completion of the plan as my regular work and continue to participate, check, and summarize. Perhaps in the future, I will participate in the formulation and implementation of their second plan... In short, I will never regard grassroots work and literary creation as two completely unrelated things. Grassroots work is the combat responsibility of an ordinary cadre to build socialism, and it is also a part of creative practice; Literary creation is the combat responsibility of a proletarian literary worker, and it is also a part of the entire struggle to build socialism. There is no "down, up" or "out, back" here. This is a path of life that is always sticking to the fighting post, a path of life that is long-term, unconditional, wholeheartedly combined with the people and fighting for the people. This is a path of life that should be consistent in the overall aspects, no matter where you place your living base in factories, troops, or any post in big cities, although the specific methods adopted by each person will be different.

    To pass through this road, we must naturally be armed with political theory, and we cannot be separated from literary activities, and we cannot fail to participate in and support the work of the literary and art circles and the Writers Association. More importantly, every province and city in our vast motherland cannot be without its own literary and art team; Only when new people continue to emerge in every corner of the country and form a large detachment under the leadership of the local party committee can the entire working class's strong and powerful literary team converge. This is also one of the main bases for writers not to be excessively concentrated in big cities but must be appropriately dispersed, because this may affect and help the rapid development of local literary and art creation and literary teams. This also determines that after we go to the provinces and cities, we must also be a member of the provincial and city literary teams and participate in local activities, and at the same time, we should fulfill the necessary responsibility for the growth of local literary newcomers. Since you are a literary warrior of the working class, you cannot imagine that you can leave the collective and only let the collective serve you, solve your difficulties, publish your works, and publish books...

    I wrote these excitedly, and I suddenly felt how complicated and complicated the road we are going to take! And many other hardships that can be imagined on this road, I have not written them all down. However, some of our comrades have walked this road very well today and during the war, and our class and people have always been the most conscious and proud to overcome any hardships to meet glory and joy. Chairman Mao taught us that we must have ambition, the ambition of socialism. Chairman Mao called us "promising" when he instructed us to combine with the people in a long-term, unconditional, and wholeheartedly manner. I once again thought of the Soviet writers who were nurtured for the October Revolution. They sacrificed the lives of 250 writers in the Great Patriotic War alone. Today, we can embark on a new path of life according to the Party's arrangements, strive to be an ambitious and promising literary worker, and strive to strengthen our working class's own strong and powerful literary team sooner and faster, and turn our literary and artistic work into a garden where a hundred flowers bloom in the socialist motherland. What could be happier for our literary workers than this!

    坚决走上新的生活道路
    康濯
    早在十五年前，毛主席就向我们指出了工人阶级作家的生活道路，应该是长期地、无条件地、全心全意地和劳动人民结合的道路。我们也看到为十月革命所培养的苏联作家队伍，更早就是这样走过来的。而这些年我们也执行了党和毛主席的指示，并且汲取了苏联的经验，因此我们也获得了显著的成就，我们队伍中也拥进了从劳动人民中和斗争锻炼中出现的文学天才。不过，已有的成就和我们队伍的情况，却还远不能满足人民的需要。最近党提出了壮大和发展工人阶级自己的文学队伍的任务，党的三中全会更号召我们深入基层参加工作和劳动；陆定一同志和周扬同志在作家协会反对丁陈反党集团会议上的讲话，也指出了我们同劳动人民结合的具体途径。我认为，党的这一系列措施，并不是一个普通的或一时的工作指示，而是在目前社会主义建设时期，向我们提出的一个根本问题，给我们安排的一条新的革命的战斗的道路；这就是为了更进一步坚决贯彻十五年前毛主席提出的方针，我们已有的和将要大量出现的工人阶级作家所必须从根本上解决的生活道路。
    当然，我们队伍中已有了一批经验和修养都相当丰富的老作家，他们一直都在刻苦地劳动着，他们是我国作家的榜样。我们也有一些中年一代的作家，十多年来已大体按照毛主席的指示，走上了正确的生活道路。但我也痛切感到我们队伍中的不小一部分，这些年来的生活方式确有问题。我们对十五年前毛主席指示的体会还并不都很深刻，执行也并不彻底。先说青年一代。全国解放后，从劳动人民中出现的青年作者，甚至是知识分子出身而很少经受过斗争锻炼的青年作者，往往刚写了几个短篇就赶紧脱离了基层或生产岗位，而采取下去“体验生活”然后回来写作的生活方式；这种方式已导致了某些青年作者的堕落和其它不好的后果。关于中年一代，除了少数始终在斗争生活中坚持岗位的，其它虽也有一些在战争时期曾经正确解决过同群众结合的生活道路，但他们当中真正是劳动人民“科班”出身的却还很少，他们在全国解放以后又大多改变了过去战争环境中的生活方式，有的是由于工作需要而住在大城市；也有一些专业写作的同志，他们斗争生活的根据地并不在城市，却也远离了自己的根据地而在大城市安家落户，只在必要时到所谓“生活”中去短期看看，然后又回来写作；甚至有的同志并无固定的生活根据地，却也如此这般地在大城市呆了下来。这样的生活方式自然也影响了上述青年作家。而这种方式虽然对有些中年以上的作家是合适的，对另外一些则可以肯定是不合适的，比如对我这样的就不合适；因为这不是彻底执行党和毛主席的指示，从根本上解决工人阶级作家的生活道路的办法。而最近党的号召，就正是针对这些情况所提出的适时的、英明的措施。
    我是无条件地响应最近党的号召，准备去农村参加工作的。并且我过去也并非完全没考虑上述这些问题。甚至还在一年以前，我就提出了离开北京去河北省深入生活与进行创作的要求，党并在今年春天就批准了我这个要求。然而，我过去的想法与现在的决心和要求，却有着某些根本性的差别。原来我是有一个较长时间的创作计划，而又感到完成那个计划的生活积累还不够，同时也由于自己在北京作了多年的工作，感到大城市的某些环境甚至会要影响创作，所以决心去我曾经工作过并且也是我计划要描写的地区，一面短期下去接触生活和补充材料，一面以主要力量进行写作。现在看来，我这个打算显然还并没从根本上彻底解决问题，甚至还和住在北京的差别并不太大；因为仅仅一个住在哪里，有时并不能决定主要问题。
    我是主张文学工作者应该有自己主要的生活根据地的。过去战争时期，我曾在河北山西农村作过几年群众工作，近年来也去那一带的农业社里短期工作过；那里劳动人民的生活斗争给了我一些锻炼改造，那里也自然成了我主要的生活根据地；而那里人民的英雄事迹和过去一同战斗过的同志也时时强烈地督促着我，使我感到不写下他们就安不下心。然而，我是不是能够比较无愧于他们地写出作品来呢？按照原来的打算，我似乎颇有信心，似乎一切都差不太多，只要短期下去补充点什么，呼吸一点新的生活气息就够了。现在，经过整风和反右派斗争，我却不能不对自己发生怀疑。我并非出身于劳动阶层，过去那段群众工作也是坐机关多，真正从事基层工作和参加劳动较少，自己主观努力也不够，在全国解放以后的城市生活中又滋长了一些错误思想；因而我在整风中深深认识到自己还不是一个党和工人阶级的坚强战士，我甚至觉得被称为作家都于心有愧。从这样的角度来考察我原来的打算，那恰恰是没有有意识地强调在劳动斗争中锻炼改造这个根本问题，好像我在过去那段群众工作中已经好好地锻炼改造了一次，并已解决了根本问题似的，而忘记了党要我们天天洗脸、照镜子的教导。这种想法本身也正好说明了我锻炼改造不够，说明了为什么进城以后还会滋长错误思想。因此，我现在的决心，首先必须是到基层工作和劳动中去进一步改造自己，不这样就任何创作计划都将不可能保证完成。
    由于我生长在南方的城市而又很早就离开了家乡，我对家乡并不熟悉，感情也不及我曾工作和战斗过的河北，我的主要生活根据地的选择应该说是合适的。但是，我对河北农村和一般的农村情况，难道就是很熟悉么？我想起了三四年前，我和赵树理同志一道在河北农村短期工作的情景。从那一段日子中鲜明地看到，我是下乡去“参加”工作和“了解”生活，虽然“了解”起来还不太困难，“参加”工作也还能插上手，甚至在具体工作中我和老赵同志也并非没有各自的长处和短处；但根本问题在于，老赵却不是下乡去“参加”和“了解”什么，而是回到了自己家里，尽管他的家乡不在河北而在山西。这就是说，我和赵树理同志实打实地较量起来，无论在对社会知识、生产知识以及对劳动人民的日常生活和风俗习惯，总之一句话，在对这些同知识分子的锻炼和写作都是运命攸关的基础知识的了解上，我比他还差了一大截；这也就是说，在同劳动人民的结合上，我还有着明显的距离，他则甚至都不必提起结合不结合。且不说他在战争时期和更早以前的地下工作当中的斗争经历，他年轻时候就种过地，干过泥木瓦活儿，赶过脚，对家乡的上党梆子也有一套把式，甚至还具备着农村的土发明家的才能。他在农村碰到具体问题，不仅能结合工作中的实际情况，并且还善于联系种种亲族关系和风俗习惯而加以考虑。他拿起一般的农具就跟拿起笔一样；也许河北的农具和山西的农具有些不同，或者竟是新式农具，那他也不过像碰见了特殊式样的钢笔似的，几句懂行的话语一问就能掌握。他甚至对油坊粉坊，对渠道水井和山坡野地，举凡一般的农副业技术和药材果木，也能和当地的行家对答如流。而我则不要说什么“行”，就是过去学习过和了解过的事物，几年后乍一见面也往往只是似曾相识，需要从头来过才能勉强应付。提起和劳动人民结合，真是谈何容易！这里来不得任何虚假而全凭扎扎实实的工夫。因而我感到目前党的号召对我说来真是对症下药，我必须毫无犹豫地深入基层工作和劳动中去进一步锻炼改造，我并且认为这就是我创作实践的第一步。
    况且我过去参加的只是民主革命阶段的群众斗争，这些年虽也短期地下乡办过社，但并没亲身经历过一个合作社发展当中的较全面的过程，以及从春到冬一年间的全部生产过程；参加集体劳动就更少，集体化以后农村各方面生活的锻炼自然也不够。而目前的社会主义农村，人民一日千里，生活瞬息万变；我的笔将要触及的不论是过去或现在，离开了对现在的体会就将是离开了人民当前的脉搏，就将使任何生花之笔变成秃笔。因而我决不能只在一时的行动上响应目前党的号召，我将彻底改变过去的打算，认真地走上长期地、无条件地、全心全意地和劳动人民结合的路途。
    那末，今后的具体安排将是怎样？因为我将成为河北省的干部，我自然要服从省里的分配。但我将争取到我过去比较熟悉的一个乡去参加具体工作。我感到目前地方党政机关对文艺工作者常要考虑各种照顾，而我们自己在今后却决不能要求任何特殊。分配作什么工作，就是什么干部。责任要全部担负，工作要积极努力。又要完成任务，又要联系群众而不强迫命令。我认为这是最起码的迎接风险考验的态度。也只有这样，才可能作到和人民共命运同呼吸与血脉相通，作到同人民的感情交流，同党的思想一致；并在党和人民的监督下，求得自己进一步的改造。
    这自然不是说要放下文艺武器，甚至也不能消极地暂时放下。不过，由于我们同劳动人民的结合决不是仅仅为了完成写作目的的一种手段，因而就责无旁贷地必须首先并且永远同人民一起战斗；而这个战斗本身也就包含了创作实践。比如，我就准备在基层工作期间，同时争取在党委的帮助下了解一些较全面的情况；并将在一定时期以后可能转移到另外的县和乡去工作，以便从多方面作到点的深入和面的开阔相结合。我当然也可以根据需要而重点了解某些材料，还可以对民间文艺加以注意。在整个工作中也有必要挤出时间，给省里的和外地的报刊写些特写和报道。一定时期以后也必然会专门写作，但在写作中还要争取短期参加工作，遇到群众性的运动就暂停写作而去参加运动。我这样设想：若干年内，一方面尽可能多地了解农村情况乃至其它方面的情况，一方面重点则放在参加两三个乡的工作，参加他们的长期规划，并在这个长时期中对那个规划的完成负责，即使离开了那里，也要把规划的完成当作自己的经常工作而不断去参与、检查和总结，或许在以后还要再参加他们第二个规划的制订和实现……总之，绝不把基层工作和文学创作当作截然无关的两件事。基层工作是一个普通干部建设社会主义的份内的战斗责任，同时也是创作实践的一部分；文学创作是一个工人阶级的文学工作者份内的战斗责任，同时也是建设社会主义的整个斗争的一部分。这里没有什么“下去、上来”或“出去、回来”，这是一条永远坚守在战斗岗位上的生活道路，长期地、无条件地、全心全意地同人民结合和为人民战斗的生活道路。这是不论把自己的生活根据地放在工厂、部队或大城市的任何岗位，尽管各人所采取的具体方式会有差别，但在总的方面却应该步伐一致的生活道路。
    要通过这条道路，自然还得有政治理论的武装，并且也不能脱离文艺活动，不能不参加和支持文艺界和作家协会的工作。更重要的是，我们广阔祖国的各个省市都不能没有自己的文艺队伍；而整个工人阶级的坚强雄厚的文学队伍，也只有在国家各个角落不断涌现出新人并在各地党委领导下组成宏大的支队以后，才能汇合起来。这也正是作家不能过分集中于大城市而必须适当分散的主要根据之一，因为这样也许可以影响和帮助各地文艺创作和文学队伍的迅速发展。这也就决定了我们去到省市以后，还得作为省市文学队伍的一员并参加当地的活动，同时也应为当地文学新人的成长尽到必要的责任。你既然是工人阶级的文艺战士，就不能想像可以离开集体而只让集体为你服务，为你解决困难、发表作品和出书……
    我激动地写下这些，我突然感到我们将要走的是一条多么复杂纷繁的道路！而这条路上可以想到的其它许多艰苦我还并没都写下来。但是，这条路在今天和在战争当中我们有些同志都走得很好，而我们的阶级和人民又从来就是最能自觉自豪地战胜任何艰苦去迎接光荣和欢乐的。毛主席教导我们必须有志气，有社会主义的志气。毛主席在指示我们长期地、无条件地、全心全意地同人民结合的时候，曾把我们称呼为“有出息的”。我还又一次想起了为十月革命培养的苏联作家，他们甚至仅仅在卫国战争中就牺牲了二百五十个作家的生命。而我们今天能够按照党的安排走上新的生活道路，争取作一个有志气的和有出息的文学工作者，并争取更快更早地壮大我们工人阶级自己坚强雄厚的文艺队伍，让我们的文艺把社会主义的祖国造成一个百花齐放的花园，我们文学工作者还会有什么比这更幸福的呢！
