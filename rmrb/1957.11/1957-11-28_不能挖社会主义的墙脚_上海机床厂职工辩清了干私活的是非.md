Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, November 27th: "Is it right to work in the factory during the day and do work for underground factories at night?" Recently, a fierce debate unfolded among the workers of the state-owned Shanghai Machine Tool Plant. The conclusion reached through the debate was: "No, doing so is tantamount to undermining the foundations of socialism."

This sharp ideological clash was triggered by the case of Huang Rongbao, a Communist Youth League member and fourth-grade lathe operator, doing work for an underground factory. Starting in the first half of this year, Huang Rongbao was different from ordinary workers. When the factory assigned him day shifts, he would work for the underground factory at night; when the factory assigned him night shifts, he would go outside to take on private jobs during the day.

Regarding Huang Rongbao's behavior, the factory's workers held two different views. Some workers believed that Huang Rongbao had financial difficulties, and it was no big deal for him to do some private work in his spare time; they argued that the products made by underground factories were also needed by society, increasing both individual income and benefiting the country, so there was nothing wrong with it. However, the majority of workers opposed this view. Many workers cited a large number of facts to refute the fallacy of this argument.

Thus, a mass debate unfolded in large and small meetings, in the dining hall, dormitory, and next to the machines. Wu Cheng, a scraper, pointed out in the debate that Huang Rongbao, due to working in the underground factory, did not get enough rest, resulting in a weakened body and inability to work night shifts at the factory. He said that doing private work during rest time would inevitably affect the factory's production. Many veteran workers also exposed the criminal behavior that Huang Rongbao had gradually engaged in to support the underground factory: Huang Rongbao first stole tools from the factory and recruited factory workers to do private work; he further stole the official seal, falsified invoices, and engaged in more than one hundred yuan of middleman exploitation; later, he even wanted to buy machines and become the boss of an underground factory. The veteran workers said: How can such behavior of tax evasion, theft of state assets, shoddy manufacturing, disruption of the state's planned economy, and operating an underground factory be said to benefit socialism?

Huang Rongbao and some workers who sympathized with him retreated and said: "Operating an underground factory is because of financial difficulties." Thus, many workers displayed Huang Rongbao's current living conditions on big-character posters and in cartoons. Huang Rongbao is only twenty-four years old this year. He used to be very poor, but now he can earn 105 yuan a month in wages and only supports four people. His family has also newly bought a bed, radio, watch, woolen uniforms, etc. Can this be called financial difficulty?

After more than a month of layer-by-layer refutation, Huang Rongbao began to realize his mistakes. He tearfully said: "I was wrong, I have let down the country's cultivation. I don't compare myself to my past life, nor do I compare myself to the lives of the broad masses of working people today, but I compare myself to the decadent and corrupt life of the bourgeoisie. Although my wage income is very high and my life is already very good, I still feel dissatisfied. In the past year or so, after I bought a new watch, radio, leather shoes, gabardine Zhongshan suit, flannel Zhongshan suit, etc., I even planned to rent a spacious house and buy furniture. So I felt that I didn't have enough money, and I started thinking about running an underground factory, and I lost interest in the factory's production. Now I realize that this is undermining the foundations of socialism, and I am deeply troubled by my conscience. I am willing to return to everyone's embrace and be a good worker again."

Some workers who were sympathetic to Huang Rongbao and had a vague understanding also became aware after the debate. For example, Zhou Lianzi, a lathe operator who had defended Huang Rongbao, confessed: "This debate is a very profound socialist education for me. Otherwise, given the opportunity, I would also have embarked on Huang Rongbao's shameful path." Sun Dexi and 19 other lathe operators who had previously worked in underground factories or ran their own underground factories also confessed their wrongdoings at mass meetings.

The welding quality of the hull workshop of the Dalian Shipyard was once called "the worst." After socialist education, the workers implemented the advanced welding method – the "six no-weld" system, and the quality has exceeded the national quality requirements. Recently, they also wrote a "guarantee for good quality, compliance with labor discipline, safety, and early completion of the annual plan," issuing a challenge to the workers of the entire factory.

The semiconductor thermoelectric generator successfully trial-produced by Longjiang Electric Factory is lightweight, beautiful, economical, and practical. When the kerosene lamp on this generator is heated to a certain temperature, it can generate direct current, and the power generation is enough to supply a radio and a small projector, and it can also be used for lighting.

Recently, this thermoelectric generator has been exported to countries such as Egypt, Thailand, and Jordan.

### 不能挖社会主义的墙脚  上海机床厂职工辩清了干私活的是非

    不能挖社会主义的墙脚
    上海机床厂职工辩清了干私活的是非
    据新华社上海27日电　“白天在厂里做工、晚上替地下工厂干活对不对？”最近在国营上海机床厂的职工群众里展开了一场激烈的争辩。争辩得出的结论是：“不对，这样做等于挖社会主义的墙脚。”
    这一场尖锐的思想交锋，是由共青团员、四级车工黄荣宝做地下工厂的活这件事引起的。黄荣宝从今年上半年开始，和一般工人不一样，工厂里轮到他做日班，晚上他就做地下厂工作；厂里轮到他做夜班，白天他就到外边去接私人的活。
    对黄荣宝这种做法，厂里的职工群众有两种不同的看法。一部分职工认为，黄荣宝的生活困难，利用业余时间做一点私活，没啥了不起；认为地下工厂做出来的东西也是社会需要的，是既增加了个人收入，又有利于国家，没什么不好。大多数职工却反对这种说法。许多工人举出大量的事实来批驳这种说法是错误的。
    于是，一场群众性的大辩论在大会小会上、食堂宿舍里和机床旁边展开了。刮工吴诚在辩论中举出，黄荣宝由于在地下工厂干活，没有很好休息，因此身体衰弱，不能在厂里做夜班。他说，在休息时间去做私活，必然会影响厂里的生产。许多老工人还揭发了黄荣宝为了搞地下工厂而一步一步做出的犯罪行为：黄荣宝先偷厂里的工具，拉厂里的工人去做私活；进一步他又偷盖公章，虚开发票，进行了一百多元的中间剥削；到后来他甚至想买机器当地下工厂的老板了。老工人们说：这种偷税漏税，盗窃国家财富，粗制滥造，破坏国家计划经济，搞地下工厂的行为，难道能说对社会主义有利吗？
    黄荣宝和有些同情他的工人又退一步说：“搞地下工厂是因为生活困难。”于是，许多工人就在大字报和漫画上摊开了黄荣宝今天的生活情况。黄荣宝今年才二十四岁，从前很穷，现在每月工资可拿一百零五元，只养活四口人，家里还新买了床、收音机、手表、毛货制服等等。这能说生活困难吗？
    经过一个多月层层批驳以后，黄荣宝开始认识到自己的错误。他痛哭流涕地说：“我错了，我辜负了国家的培养。我不和过去的生活比，也不和今天广大劳动人民的生活比，我却和资产阶级享乐腐化的生活比。虽然我的工资收入很多、生活已经过得很好了，但是我还是感到不满足。这一年多来，我买了新手表、收音机、皮鞋、哔叽中山装、花呢中山装等等以后，我甚至还打算租一间宽敞的房子，添购家俱。所以我就感到钱不够用了，就动脑筋去搞地下工厂了，对厂里的生产也就没有劲了。现在我认识到这是在挖社会主义的墙脚，我深深受到良心的责备，我愿意回到大家的怀抱里来，重新做个好工人。”
    原来一些同情黄荣宝的认识模糊的工人，经过辩论以后也觉悟过来了。如曾经替黄荣宝辩护过的车工周连子检讨说：“这场辩论对我是一次极深刻的社会主义教育，要不然有了机会，我也会走上黄荣宝的可耻的道路的。”过去曾经在地下工厂做过工或自己搞过地下工厂的车工孙德熹等二十人，也纷纷在群众会上检查了自己的错误行为。
    大连造船厂船体车间的电焊质量，过去被大家称为“倒数第一”。经过社会主义教育，工人们贯彻了先进的电焊法——六不焊制度，质量已经超过国家质量要求。最近他们又写下了“质量好、遵守劳动纪律、安全、提前完成全年计划的保证书，向全厂工人发出挑战。

    龙江电工厂试制成功的半导体热电发生器，轻便美观，经济适用。这种发生器上的煤油灯加热到一定温度便可产生直流电，发电量足可供给一架收音机和一支小型幻灯机使用，也可以用于照明。
    最近，这种热电发生器已经外销到埃及、泰国、约旦等国。
