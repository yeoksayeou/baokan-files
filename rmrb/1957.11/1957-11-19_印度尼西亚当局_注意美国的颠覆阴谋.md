Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 18th - "Indonesia Torch Daily" said today that Indonesian authorities attach great importance to news that the US Ambassador to Indonesia is involved in a conspiracy to overthrow President Sukarno.
    Major Hasono of the Indonesian Army Intelligence Service, when answering inquiries from the "Indonesia Torch Daily" reporter, said that the army is paying close attention to subversive activities in Indonesia.
    Jakarta newspapers widely published the secret documents issued by US Ambassador to Indonesia, Allison, to the US State Department, which were published by the Indian "Blitz" weekly.
