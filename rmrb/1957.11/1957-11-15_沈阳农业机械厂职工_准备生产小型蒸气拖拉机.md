Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 14th -- Employees of the Shenyang Agricultural Machinery Plant are preparing to manufacture small steam tractors in large quantities to meet the needs of national agricultural development.

In the past, this factory mainly produced large-scale agricultural implements such as grain seed selectors, corn planters, and 48-row seeders for state-owned farms. Recently, in order to support agricultural production, the factory, after repeated discussions, decided to shift its production direction to mass-produce small steam tractors and other small and lightweight agricultural machinery urgently needed by general agricultural producers' cooperatives.

This small steam tractor has ten horsepower. Its characteristics are that it is lightweight, simple in structure, and can be driven by ordinary farmers. In addition, it can use firewood, sorghum stalks, grass roots, or coal as fuel according to local conditions, which can save a lot of liquid fuel. Because the body is equipped with a chassis and wheels, it can not only draw well water and river water to prevent drought and drain floods, but also pull various machines for sowing, cultivating, earthing, weeding, and ginning cotton. When equipped with vehicles, it can replace cattle and horses to haul goods, and can operate continuously for more than 1,000 hours in hilly areas.

Currently, the factory is making preparations for production.

    准备生产小型蒸气拖拉机
    新华社沈阳14日电　沈阳农业机械厂根据全国发展农业的需要，正在准备大批制造小型蒸气拖拉机。
    这个工厂过去主要是生产国营农场用的谷物选种机、玉米点播机和四十八行播种机等大型农具。最近这个厂为了支援农业生产，经过多次讨论，决定转变生产方向，大量生产一般农业生产合作社迫切需要的小型蒸气拖拉机以及其他小型、轻巧的农业机械。
    这种小型蒸气拖拉机是十匹马力的。它的特点是轻巧，结构简单，一般农民都可以驾驶。另外它还可以根据当地条件用木柴、秫秸、草根或煤炭作燃料，能节约大量液体燃料。因为机体下方装有底盘、车轮，它不仅能够抽取井水、河水来防旱、排涝，还可以牵引各种机件进行播种、中耕、培土、除草、轧棉花，挂上车辆可以代替牛马拖拉货物，而且能在丘陵地带连续开动一千小时以上。
    目前，这个厂正在进行生产的准备工作。
