Xinhua News Agency, 12th: By the end of October, over 58% of this year's cotton unified purchase plan had been completed. The national purchase of lint cotton was 61.7% more than the purchase volume in the same period last year and 21.7% more than the same period in the bumper harvest year of 1955.

Although the cotton purchase situation is generally good, there are still some problems in the work. In some areas, the publicity of the cotton unified purchase policy is not deep or thorough enough, causing some agricultural cooperatives to still be reluctant to sell cotton. For example, in Huarong County, Hunan, although fifty-nine agricultural cooperatives have overfulfilled the cotton unified purchase task, there are still many cooperatives that have not yet sold. Some agricultural cooperatives have not properly implemented the State Council's regulations on retained cotton and there are still phenomena of private distribution and excessive distribution. In Wangdu County, Hebei, one hundred and four cooperatives have distributed all the retained cotton, most of them according to nine jin of seed cotton per person, exceeding the state-stipulated cotton retention standard. The purchasing departments in some areas, seeing that this year's cotton harvest is good and the purchasing situation in the previous stage was relatively good, believe that completing the cotton unified purchase task is not a problem and have relaxed their purchasing work. Qi County, Henan, reduced the number of purchasing cadres from one hundred and seventy to seventy, which affected the cotton purchasing work. Some areas even promote slow purchasing. The Hetan purchasing station in Cheng'an County, Hebei, only accepts good cotton of second or third grade, refusing to accept other grades of cotton. Cadres at the Chengguan purchasing station in Fuping County, Shaanxi, emphasize adhering to the system of going to and from work, not accepting purchases after hours, and not accepting purchases on Sundays. Purchasing departments and agricultural cooperatives in some areas neglect the storage of cotton, resulting in fires, thefts, and other incidents, incurring losses.

A person in charge of the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives told reporters that in order to better complete this year's cotton unified purchase task, the current priority is to overcome the complacency of purchasing cadres, further implement the policy of purchasing more and purchasing quickly, and purchasing departments in various places should take various measures to help and solve the difficulties of agricultural cooperatives in selling cotton, such as insufficient manpower, livestock power, and processing equipment. Secondly, it is necessary to continue to deeply implement the cotton unified purchase policy and the state-stipulated cotton retention standards for cotton farmers. Third, it is necessary to do a good job in the late-stage management of cotton, mobilize the masses to pick and clean the cotton, and ensure that all cotton is brought home. Hebei has carried out the "three searches" campaign to find fallen cotton, eyelashes, and dead bolls, with good results. In Handan Prefecture alone, by the end of October, eight hundred and eighty-five agricultural cooperatives had found more than 600,000 jin of fallen cotton, eyelashes, and dead bolls on 190,000 mu of cotton fields, an average increase of more than three jin per mu. Finally, special attention must also be paid to the storage of cotton, and measures must be taken to prevent cotton from being lost.

    今年棉花统购情况较好，但问题不少
    要克服松劲思想加强收购工作
    到十月底止已完成统购计划百分之五十八以上
    新华社12日讯　本年度的棉花统购计划到10月底止已完成58％以上。全国收购的皮棉，比去年同期的收购量多61．7％，比丰收的1955年同期多21．7％。
    棉花收购情况总的说来虽然比较好，但是工作中还存在一些问题。有的地区对棉花统购政策宣传的不深不透，致使有些农业社对棉花还抱有惜售态度。如湖南华容县，虽然有五十九个农业社超额完成了棉花统购任务，但还有不少社至今还未出售。有的农业社还没有很好贯彻国务院关于自留棉的规定，仍有私分、多分的现象。河北望都县有一百零四个社分完了自留棉，大部分是按每人九斤籽棉分的，超过了国家规定的留棉标准。有些地区的采购部门，看到今年棉花丰收了，前一阶段收购情况又比较好，就认为完成棉花统购任务不成问题，而 放松了收购工作。河南杞县把采购干部从一百七十人减少到七十人，使棉花收购工作受到影响。有的地区甚至宣传缓收，河北成安县河滩采购站，只收二级或三级的好花，拒收其他等级的棉花。陕西富平县城关采购站干部，强调遵守上、下班制度，过时不收，星期日不收。有些地区的采购部门和农业社忽视对棉花的保管工作，以致发生失火、偷盗等事件，遭受了损失。
    全国供销合作总社一位负责人对记者说，为了更好地完成今年的棉花统购任务，当前，首先要克服采购干部的松劲思想，进一步贯彻多收快收的方针，各地采购部门应该采取多种措施帮助和解决农业社出售棉花所需要的人力、畜力和加工设备不足的困难。其次要继续深入贯彻棉花统购政策和国家规定的棉农自留棉标准。第三是要做好棉花后期管理工作，要发动群众把棉花摘干拣净，做到所有棉花全部还家。河北各地开展找落地花、眼睫毛、僵瓣的“三找”运动，效果很好。仅邯郸专区到10月底就有八百八十五个农业社在十九万亩棉田里找到落地花、眼睫毛和僵瓣六十多万斤，平均每亩增加收获量三斤多。最后，对棉花保管工作也必须特别注意，要采取措施不使棉花受到损失。
