Go!
   (Written in response to the United States forcing the International Red Cross Conference to allow the Chiang gang to attend, and seventeen countries withdrawing from the meeting to protest.)

   Go! Let your beloved "Republic of China" kowtow to you! Your "strength" seems to be squeaking under the pressure, but today it's all crossed out! "Despicable"! China spits, "Resign"! The Indian chairman is shaking with anger, and the Soviet Union and other countries wave their hands: Meeting with "political zombies"? Who can endure it any longer! From now on, it's not just the Red Cross that you, the United States, will be held responsible for damaging, but wherever your voting machine is activated, you'll have to clean up the mess!

    走！
    俯拾（为美国强迫国际红十字大会让蒋帮出席，十七国退出会场表示抗议作）走！让你美国心爱的“中华民国”给你磕头！你的“实力”好像还压的吱吱响，可是，今天一笔勾！“可鄙”！中国吐口唾沫，“辞职”！印度做主席的气的发抖，苏联等国手一挥：和“政治僵尸”开会？！谁还能再忍受！从今后，要你美国负破坏责任的不仅是红十字会，凡有你表决机器开动的地方，烂摊子都由你收！
