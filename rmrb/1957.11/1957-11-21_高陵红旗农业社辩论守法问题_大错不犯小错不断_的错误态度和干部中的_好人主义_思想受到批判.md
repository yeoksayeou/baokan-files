Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an: The Hongqi Agricultural Cooperative in Gaoling County, Shaanxi Province, recently launched a heated debate on the issue of law abidance among all its members after studying the "Regulations on Administrative Penalties for Public Security."

More than 70% of the cooperative members participated in the debate, which focused on the central question of "Is there a contradiction between law abidance and democracy?" A small number of members believed that the "Regulations on Administrative Penalties for Public Security" were "regulations to persecute people," saying, "This confines people to death, so what's the point of talking about democracy?" However, the vast majority of members opposed this view. Lu Zhongshu, the deputy director of the cooperative, said, "As the saying goes, even the best wound medicine is no match for not getting hurt in the first place. If you don't want to be a bad person or do bad things, the law won't bind you." "Besides, democracy and law abidance are not contradictory at all. To have democracy, you must abide by the law. Otherwise, a few people will undermine the interests of the majority, and democracy cannot be guaranteed." Many members supported Lu Zhongshu's view and used many facts of damaging public property and violating labor discipline within the cooperative in the past year to further illustrate the relationship between law abidance and democracy. In the past year alone, more than a dozen accidents, such as livestock injuries and deaths, have been caused by members failing to comply with the livestock breeding management system, and violations of labor discipline hindering production are even more common. Many people are careless about the quality of their work, and when tasks are assigned, they pick and choose, refusing to accept assignments. Recently, according to reports from two production teams, nearly a thousand pounds of beans were spoiled because of this. In addition, individual cadres have also violated laws and regulations. For example, An Yankun, the accountant of the eleventh production team, privately recorded more than 300 work points for himself and his wife. After these things happened, due to the imperfect system within the cooperative, some of them have not been resolved for a long time, but often lead to quarrels and fights, causing disunity within the cooperative. Through the exposure and discussion of these facts, everyone finally realized that if this situation is allowed to develop, the cooperative would be in danger of collapsing, and there would be no way to talk about democracy at that time.

After the debate, although everyone understood that law abidance is an important guarantee of democracy, some people felt a lack of confidence, and proposed that even if laws and regulations are good, it would only be empty talk if everyone does not follow them. Why don't they follow them? Some members said that this is primarily because individual cadres have not taken the lead in implementing them. Some people said that this is because some members believe that they have a good background and hold the erroneous attitude of "no major mistakes, but constant minor errors." Others said that this is because there is a "good old boy" mentality among members and cadres, who do not interfere or stop illegal and undisciplined behavior when they see it, thus condoning the development of unhealthy tendencies. Based on the named exposures by the members, many people made self-criticisms at the meeting. The meeting summarized everyone's opinions and believed that in order to ensure that the legal system is well implemented, everyone must treat it with the attitude of a master, and everyone must fight against their own or others' illegal and undisciplined behavior. This both gave full play to democracy and truly enabled the legal system to play its role in safeguarding democracy.

Through this debate, in accordance with the spirit of "everyone is responsible for abiding by the law," the members re-revised and supplemented the cooperative's labor discipline, farm tool storage, breeding management and other systems, and also stipulated that the cooperative management committee should check the implementation of the system once every half a month to a month, and when necessary, it should also convene a members' meeting to discuss and study.

    高陵红旗农业社辩论守法问题
    “大错不犯小错不断”的错误态度和干部中的“好人主义”思想受到批判
    新华社西安讯　陕西省高陵县红旗农业社最近在学习“治安管理处罚条例”后，全体社员对守法问题展开了热烈的辩论。
    参加辩论的社员有70％以上发了言，讨论涉及的中心问题是“守法和民主是不是有矛盾？”有一小部分社员认为“治安管理处罚条例”是“整人条例”，“这把人都箍死了，还讲啥民主。”但是绝大多数社员反对这种看法。这个社的副主任路中书说：“俗话说得好，金疮药虽好，不伤不破最好。谁不愿当坏人、做坏事，法就箍不到谁身上。”“再说，民主和守法一点不矛盾。要民主，就要守法。不然，少数人破坏大家利益，民主就保不全了。”许多社员都支持路中书的说法，并且用社内过去许多破坏公共财产、破坏劳动纪律的事实来进一步说明守法和民主的关系。在最近一年中，这个社社员因为不遵守牲畜饲养管理制度，造成了牲畜伤亡等事故十多起，社员不遵守劳动纪律而妨碍生产的事更是普遍。许多人做活不讲究质量，派活时挑精拣肥不服从分配。最近，据两个生产队的反映，就曾经因此而霉坏了近千斤豆子。此外，个别干部还违法乱纪，例如第十一生产队会计安言坤就曾私自给他自己和他的妻子多记了三百多个工分。这些事情发生后，由于社内制度不够健全，有的长期得不到解决，反而常常引起吵嘴、打架，造成社内不团结。通过对这些事实的揭发和讨论，大家最后一致认识到如果让这种情况发展下去，合作社就有垮台的危险，那时就根本谈不上民主了。
    经过辩论后，大家虽然懂得了守法是民主的重要保证，但是有人感到信心不足，提出法令制度虽好，大家不照着做也是纸上谈兵。为什么不照着做？有些社员说，这首先是个别干部没有带头执行。有些人说，这是因为有些社员认为自己成分好，抱着“大错不犯，小错不断”的错误态度。还有人说，这是因为社员和干部中都有“好人主义”思想，看到违法乱纪的事情也不干涉不制止，所以纵容了歪风的发展。根据社员的指名揭发，会上有许多人自动作了检查。会议总结了大家的意见，认为要使法律制度很好贯彻执行，就要人人用主人翁的态度来对待它，人人都要和自己或别人的违法乱纪行为作斗争。这就既发挥了民主，又使法律制度真正起了保障民主的作用。
    通过这次辩论，社员们根据“守法人人有责”的精神，重新修订和增订了社内劳动纪律、农具保管、饲养管理等制度，还规定每半个月到一个月，由社管理委员会检查一次制度的执行情况，必要时还应召开社员大会来讨论和研究。
