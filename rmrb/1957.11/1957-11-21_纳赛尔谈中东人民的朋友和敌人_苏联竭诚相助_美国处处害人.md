Xinhua News Agency, New York, November 20th: Egyptian President Nasser, in an interview with "Newsweek" reporter Lindley, said that the purpose of the "Eisenhower Doctrine" is "the same as the purpose of the Anglo-French aggression."

The November 19th issue of "Newsweek" published Nasser's remarks. When discussing US-Egyptian relations, Nasser said: "There is pressure to change our policy direction and make it completely subordinate to the United States. The United States has taken some actions that insult us. You are trying to isolate Egypt. You have applied economic pressure. You are also conducting a propaganda war. Your secret radio stations aim to undermine our government and turn our people against their government. There have also been conspiracies against the government and against me."

He said he hoped to have friendly relations with the United States. But he reminded, "If our sovereignty and dignity are affected, we will not be willing."

Nasser condemned the United States' subversive activities in Jordan, saying: "You are trying to make them your friends and our enemies. We want to keep them as friends, but not make them your enemies. It is you who destroyed the Jordanian government and tried to overthrow the Syrian government."

Nasser said that Syria "had asked you and other countries for weapons. A year and a half ago, I asked (British Foreign Secretary) Lloyd to supply them with six planes. He refused. But Israel was supplied. Syria tried to get help from the World Bank, but it could not get help on fair terms. A country cannot stand still. Therefore, Syria signed an agreement with the Soviet Union to improve its living standards. I don't think this means making oneself dependent on any one country. I would not hesitate to take the same steps. I will not wait for the United States to destroy Egypt."

Nasser compared the policies of the West and the Soviet Union towards the Middle East, saying: Look at the situation in the Middle East. The Middle East is under the rule of Britain and France. We are fighting for independence. The Soviet Union has not ruled—so we cannot oppose the Soviet Union. Britain, France, and the United States refused to supply us with weapons, but supplied Israel with weapons—especially France. The Soviet Union provided us with weapons. The Soviet Union asked to participate in the investment in the Aswan Dam. The United States withdrew its proposal in an insulting manner.

He added: "The Soviets supported the nationalization of Suez; the United States supported internationalization. So we have no reason to attack the Soviet Union." "Later we were short of wheat—only fifteen days' storage left. We asked you for help. You refused. Later you agreed, but only if it was paid for in US dollars, but you froze our US dollars. This means that the United States is unwilling to help us in our time of crisis. We asked the Soviet Union for help. The Soviet Union had no reserves, but it sent us wheat. The situation is the same with medicine, gasoline, and so on."

Lindley asked him, "Do you really believe the United States wants to bring you down?"

Nasser said: "I really believe so. They don't want me to speak for Egypt. The wheat deal means they want to kill us with hunger. They ignore any demands from Egypt. They want to have the right to take hostile actions, but do not want others to have the right to do so. We have such a tradition here: we are hungry, but if assistance is offered that damages dignity, then it will be rejected."

### 纳赛尔谈中东人民的朋友和敌人  苏联竭诚相助　美国处处害人

    纳赛尔谈中东人民的朋友和敌人
    苏联竭诚相助　美国处处害人
    新华社20日讯　纽约消息：埃及总统纳赛尔在接见美国“新闻周刊”记者林德莱的时候说，“艾森豪威尔主义”的目的“同英法侵略的目的是同样的”。
    19日的“新闻周刊”登载了纳赛尔的谈话。纳赛尔在谈到美埃关系的时候说：“有一种压力要改变我们的政策方针，并且使它完全听命于美国。美国采取了一些侮辱我们的行动。你们正在设法孤立埃及。你们施用了经济压力。你们又进行宣传战。你们的秘密广播电台的目的是要破坏我们的政府，使我们的人民反对他们的政府。还进行了反对政府和反对我的阴谋。”
    他说，他希望同美国有友好关系。可是他提醒说，“如果我们的主权和尊严受到影响，那我们就不愿意”。
    纳赛尔谴责美国对约旦的颠覆活动，他说：“你们企图使他们做你们的朋友，做我们的敌人。我们要使他们仍旧做朋友，但不使他们做你们的敌人。是你们破坏了约旦政府，和企图推翻叙利亚政府。”
    纳赛尔说，叙利亚“曾要求你们和其他国家给予武器。一年半以前我曾要求（英国外交大臣）劳埃德供给他们六架飞机。他拒绝了。但是以色列得到了供应。叙利亚企图从世界银行得到帮助，但是它不能够在公平的条件上得到帮助。一个国家不能停止不动。因此叙利亚同苏联签订了一项协议以提高它的生活水准。我并不认为这意味着使自己依附任何一个国家。我会毫不迟疑地采取同样的步骤。我不会等待美国来毁灭埃及。”
    纳赛尔把西方和苏联对中东的政策作了对比，他说：请看一下中东的情况。中东在英国和法国的统治之下，我们为争取独立而奋斗，苏联并没有进行统治——因此我们不能反对苏联。英国、法国和美国拒绝供给我们武器，而供给以色列武器——特别是法国。苏联向我们提供了武器。苏联要求参与投资阿斯旺水坝的事。美国以一种侮辱的方式撤销了它的建议。
    他又说：“苏联人支持苏伊士的国有化；美国支持国际化。因此我们没有理由去攻击苏联。”“后来我们缺少小麦——只有十五天的贮存量了。我们要求你们援助。你们拒绝了。后来你们又同意了，如果是用美金付款的话，但是你们冻结了我们的美金。这意味着美国不愿意在我们危急的时候帮助我们。我们请求苏联援助。苏联没有贮存，但是，它送给我们小麦。在医药、汽油等方面的情况也是一样的。”
    林德莱问他“你真的相信美国要使你下台吗？”
    纳赛尔说：“我真的这样相信。他们不要我为埃及说话。小麦交易意味着他们想要用饥饿来杀死我们。他们不理睬埃及的任何要求。他们要有采取敌对行动的权利，但是不希望别人有这样做的权利。我们这里有这样的传统：我们是饥饿的，但是，如果提出损伤尊严的援助，那就予以拒绝。”
