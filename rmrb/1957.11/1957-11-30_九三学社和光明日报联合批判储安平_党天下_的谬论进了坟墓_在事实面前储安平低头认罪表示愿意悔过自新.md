Xinhua News Agency, November 29th: The Central Committee of the Jiusan Society and the Guangming Daily jointly held three conferences on the 24th, 25th, and 28th to systematically and thoroughly expose and criticize the reactionary words and deeds of rightist Chu Anping. At the meetings, by presenting the facts and reasoning things out, Chu Anping's so-called "Party's World" fallacy was refuted completely. Chu Anping, at the end of his rope, had no choice but to bow his head to the people and confess his crimes.

The conferences were presided over by Xu Deheng, Chairman of the Jiusan Society, and Yang Mingxuan, President of Guangming Daily. Each conference was attended by more than 1,000 people, including members of the Jiusan Society, employees of Guangming Daily, staff members of central state organs, and representatives from universities and colleges.

At the meeting, Xu Deheng cited many instances of his personal involvement in decisions on major national policies to refute the "Party's World" fallacy. He said that the formulation of major national policies and guidelines was decided after Chairman Mao himself invited various democratic parties and non-party democratic人士 to fully discuss them. Some were even submitted to the masses for repeated discussions. For example, the formulation of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China went through detailed discussions and several revisions by various democratic parties, people's organizations, and about 150 million people across the country before it was submitted to the National People's Congress for deliberation and approval. Xu Deheng also cited the Draft National Agricultural Development Program (1956-1967), the Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme, and the supply methods for cooking oil and pork, all of which were decided after full consultation with all parties. Xu Deheng questioned Chu Anping: "Such brilliant examples of repeatedly seeking the opinions of the broad masses and concentrating the wisdom of the broad masses can only be achieved in a country under the leadership of the Communist Party. Can this be called the 'Party's World'?"

Li Zuyin refuted the "Party's World" fallacy from the perspective of the national system. He specifically discussed the appointment of the twelve vice premiers mentioned in the "Party's World" fallacy. Li Zuyin said that according to Articles 27, 31, and 40 of the Constitution, these twelve vice premiers were all appointed by the National People's Congress. The Constitution stipulates this, and it is also implemented in practice. Moreover, these twelve vice premiers have all performed their duties competently and have not failed the trust of the people. The reason why Chu Anping seized on this point to attack, and blatantly demanded that so-called "non-Party人士 sit in these chairs," was essentially to fight for the position of vice premier for Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji.

Members of the Jiusan Society engaged in science and technology, culture and education, and medicine and health all used their personal experiences to prove the correctness of the Party's leadership and refute the "Party's World" fallacy. Mao Yisheng made a sharp comparison between the construction of the Qiantang River Bridge before liberation and the construction of the Yangtze River Bridge after liberation, explaining that the vigorous development of science in our country is the result of the leadership of the Communist Party. He said, "There is no doubt that the Party is fully capable of leading science and technology, and the Party is a great expert in leading science and technology." Yan Jici, Pan Shu, Yin Zanxun, Yang Zhongjian, Fei Wenzhong, and others, in a joint statement, demanded that "in developing socialist science, not only must the Party lead, but also the Party's leadership must be further strengthened; not only must the Party lead in terms of principles and policies, but also the Party must lead in specific terms."

Wang Xu, a professor at Beijing Medical College, said: Venereal diseases, which used to be the most harmful in our country, are now close to being eliminated. Yunnan's malarial areas and the blood fluke disease in Jiangnan, which were once considered insurmountable, have now been basically resolved or will soon be resolved. Wang Xu questioned Chu Anping: "Without the leadership of the Communist Party, could we have achieved such amazing achievements?"

Sun Dingguo, Deputy Director of the Philosophy Teaching and Research Office of the Central Party School of the Communist Party of China, in a speech of more than two hours, theoretically and in detail criticized Chu Anping's "Party's World" fallacy. Sun Dingguo said: Chu Anping's speech at the symposium of the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee on June 1 was a political program of bourgeois rightists against the Communist Party, against the people, and against socialism. It concentrated its attack on three fundamental issues in our political life: first, the issue of the dictatorship of the proletariat; second, the issue of the Party's leadership; third, the issue of the core role of the Party Central Committee and the Party's leaders. Regarding the first issue, Sun Dingguo said that whether it is a capitalist system or a socialist system, whether it is a bourgeois dictatorship or a proletarian dictatorship, this is the central issue of our great debate with the bourgeois rightists. Chu Anping's series of criminal activities revolved around the restoration of the bourgeoisie, but this is just a dream, and it will never be possible. Regarding the second issue, the essence is whether or not to have the leadership of the Communist Party. Chu Anping attacked the Communist Party with "Party's World," which is judging the heart of a gentleman with the mind of a villain, because the idea of "family world" is a product of private ownership, the thought of slave owners, feudal lords, and capitalists, which is fundamentally unrelated to the proletariat and its political party. Sun Dingguo also pointed out: We should clearly state that today's world of this New China is the world led by the Communist Party, because the facts prove that only a China led by the Communist Party belongs to the people.

When talking about the last question, Sun Dingguo said that we must clarify the fundamental difference between personal worship and love for leaders, so as to get rid of Chu Anping's malicious slander. Marxists firmly oppose personal worship, but at the same time do not deny the role of outstanding figures in history, because the reason why outstanding figures can play a prominent role in history is that they can correctly reflect the objective requirements of historical development and correctly reflect the will of the people. The Chinese people's love for the Communist Party and Chairman Mao is combined with their love for their own happy lives and their own great future. Therefore, no matter how maliciously Chu Anping attacks the Party Central Committee and the Party's leaders, it will be of no avail.

Wang Guang, a worker representative from the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant in Beijing, refuted the "Party's World" fallacy at the meeting, saying: The Chinese people's recognition of the Communist Party's leading position and support for the Communist Party's leadership is the result of the Chinese people's choice from the lessons of past failures and from countless sacrifices of bloodshed, and it is also the inevitable result of historical development. Without the leadership of the Communist Party, the Chinese people, especially the working people, would not be able to live a happy life, but only a life worse than cattle and horses; without the leadership of the Communist Party, we could not be guaranteed to take the socialist road.

Wei Guobin, a farmer representative from the Wuyi Agricultural Production Cooperative in Yongfengtun Township, Changping District, Beijing, pointed out: Chu Anping wants us to go back to the days of exchanging twenty catties of corn flour for a daughter, and let the rightists "come to power" to oppress and exploit us. We will never agree to this. The 500 million farmers across the country have personally felt the kindness of the Communist Party. The rightists want us to leave the leadership of the Communist Party, which is absolutely impossible.

Huang Zhuoming, Xu Yian, and Qiu Lin of Guangming Daily respectively spoke at the meeting, exposing and criticizing Chu Anping's reactionary words and deeds.

Chang Zhigeng and Sun Chengpei criticized the reactionary essence of Chu Anping's "Observer" magazine before liberation in their speeches, exposing the hypocrisy of Chu Anping's professed "freedom" and "neutrality."

At the meeting, although Chu Anping made a "self-criticism" while avoiding the important points, he had to admit his crimes against the Communist Party and the people in the face of a large number of facts. He expressed his willingness to repent and start anew, and to be a new person.

    九三学社和光明日报联合批判储安平
    “党天下”的谬论进了坟墓
    在事实面前储安平低头认罪表示愿意悔过自新
    据新华社29日讯　九三学社中央和光明日报社在24、25、28日联合举行了三次大会，系统深入地揭露和批判右派分子储安平的反动言行。会上，用摆事实讲道理的方法，把储安平所谓的“党天下”的谬论批驳得体无完肤，储安平理屈词穷，不得不向人民低头认罪。
    大会由九三学社主席许德珩、光明日报社社长杨明轩主持。每次出席大会的有九三学社社员、光明日报社职工以及中央国家机关工作人员、高等学校代表等一千多人。
    许德珩在会上举出许多亲身参与的决定国家重大政策的经过，来驳斥“党天下”谬论。他说，国家重大的方针政策的制定，都是毛主席亲自邀请各民主党派及无党派民主人士充分商量以后才决定的，有些并且交给人民群众反复讨论，例如中华人民共和国宪法的制定，就是经过各民主党派、各人民团体以及全国约一亿五千多万人的详细讨论，几经修改，才提到全国人民代表大会审议通过。许德珩又举出1956—1967年全国农业发展纲要草案、汉语拼音方案以及关于食油、猪肉的供应办法等，无不通过各方面充分协商后才作出决定的。许德珩质问储安平：“像这样反复不断地征求广大人民的意见，集中广大群众智慧的光辉例证，只有共产党领导下的国家才能做得到，这能说是‘党天下’吗？”
    李祖荫从国家制度方面来驳斥“党天下”的谬论，他特别谈到“党天下”谬论中涉及的有关十二位副总理的任命问题。李祖荫说，根据宪法第二十七条、第三十一条和第四十条的规定，这十二位副总理都由全国人民代表大会决定任命，宪法如此规定，实际也是这样执行的。而且这十二位副总理都工作得很称职，并没有辜负全国人民的信任。而储安平所以要抓住这一点来进行攻击，并且露骨地要求所谓“由党外人士坐此交椅”，其实质只是想为章伯钧、罗隆基来争副总理而已。
    从事科学技术、文教、医药卫生等工作的九三学社社员，都从自己亲身的经历来证明党的正确领导，驳斥“党天下”的谬论。茅以升把解放前修钱塘江大桥和解放后修长江大桥的经过作了鲜明的对比，说明我国科学之所以能蓬勃发展，是由于共产党领导的结果，他说“毫无疑义，党是完全能够领导科学技术的，党是领导科学技术的大内行。” 　　严济慈、潘菽、尹赞勋、杨锺健、斐文中等五人在联合发言中，要求“在发展社会主义科学事业上，不但须要党来领导，而且还要更加加强党的领导；不但要党在方针政策上的领导，而且还要党的具体领导。”
    北京医学院教授王序说：我国过去为害最烈的花柳病，现已接近消灭，过去认为无法克服的云南瘴区以及江南的血吸虫病，现已基本解决或不久就可解决。王序质问储安平：“没有共产党的领导，我们能有这样的惊人成就吗？”
    中共中央高级党校哲学教研室副主任孙定国以两个多小时的发言，从理论上详细地批驳了储安平的“党天下”谬论，孙定国说：储安平6月1日在中共中央统战部座谈会上的发言，是资产阶级右派分子反共反人民反社会主义的政治纲领，它把攻击点集中在我国政治生活中三个带有根本性质的问题：一、关于无产阶级专政问题；二、关于党的领导问题；三、关于党的中央、党的领袖的核心作用问题。对于第一个问题，孙定国说，是资本主义制度还是社会主义制度，是资产阶级专政还是无产阶级专政，这是我们和资产阶级右派进行大辩论的中心问题。储安平一系列的罪恶活动，就是环绕着资产阶级复辟为中心的，但这只是梦想，是永远不可能的事。关于第二个问题，实质上就是要不要共产党领导的问题。储安平以“党天下”来攻击共产党，这是以小人之心度君子之腹，因为“家天下”的思想是私有制的产物，是奴隶主、封建主、资本家的思想，它和无产阶级以及它的政党是根本不相干的。孙定国同时也指出：我们应该明白表示，今天这个新中国的天下，就是共产党领导的天下，因为事实证明，只有共产党领导的中国，中国才是属于人民的。
    在讲到最后一个问题时，孙定国说，我们必须弄清楚个人崇拜和热爱领袖的根本区别，这样才能摆脱储安平的恶毒的中伤。马克思主义者是坚决反对个人崇拜的，但同时又不否认杰出人物在历史上的作用，因为杰出人物之所以能在历史上起卓越的作用，是因为他能够正确地反映历史发展的客观要求，正确地反映人民的意志。中国人民之热爱共产党和毛主席是和热爱人民自己的幸福生活、热爱自己的远大未来结合在一起的。因此，任凭储安平对党中央、对党的领袖进行怎样恶毒的攻击，都是无济于事的。
    北京石景山钢铁厂的工人代表王广在会上驳斥“党天下”的谬论说：全中国人民承认共产党的领导地位和拥护共产党的领导，是中国人民从历次失败的教训中、从无数的流血牺牲中选择的结果，也是历史发展的必然结果。没有共产党的领导，我国人民首先是劳动人民就不能过幸福的生活，只能过牛马不如的日子；没有共产党的领导，就不能保证我们走社会主义的道路。
    农民代表、北京昌平区永丰屯乡五一农业生产合作社的魏国宾指出：储安平是要我们再过二十斤玉米面交换一个闺女的日子，让右派分子“上台”来压迫、剥削我们，我们是坚决不答应的。全国五亿农民亲身感受到共产党的恩情，右派分子要我们离开共产党的领导，是万万办不到的。
    光明日报黄卓明、徐亦安、丘林分别在会上发言，揭露、批判储安平的反动言行。
    常芝青和孙承佩在发言里批判了储安平在解放前办“观察”杂志的反动实质，揭穿了储安平所标榜的“自由”、“中立”的假面具。
    会上，储安平虽然避重就轻地作了“检讨”，但是他在大量的事实面前，不得不承认他反共反人民的罪行，他表示愿意悔过自新，重新作人。
