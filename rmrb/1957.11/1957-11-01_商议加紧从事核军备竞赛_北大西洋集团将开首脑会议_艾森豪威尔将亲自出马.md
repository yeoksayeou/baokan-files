Xinhua News Agency, 31st dispatch from Paris: The North Atlantic Group Council of Permanent Representatives officially announced after a meeting on October 30th that the Council meeting scheduled for December will be a summit-level meeting. A spokesman for the group confirmed that US President Eisenhower will attend the meeting in person.

The reason Britain and the United States decided to hastily convene such a meeting during their talks in Washington was to reassure the Western world, which was showing alarm at the Soviet Union's tremendous scientific progress.

It is revealed that this meeting will prioritize the discussion of pooling Western manpower and material resources to engage in the nuclear arms race. In addition, the meeting will also study Britain's plan to reduce manpower and rely more on nuclear weapons, as well as a new "defense" plan drafted by the Supreme Commander of the North Atlantic Group, Norstad.

In the past two days, Western countries have been constantly engaged in activities surrounding this meeting. In Washington, Eisenhower summoned Norstad to discuss some issues of the North Atlantic Group. The State Department also summoned the US ambassadors to the fourteen member states of the North Atlantic Group to convey to them the plan for the meeting to be held in December.

In Western Europe, West German Chancellor Adenauer decided to attend the summit meeting, and he will also go to Britain to talk with Macmillan before the meeting. It is reported that as soon as the new French government is formed, Macmillan will go to Paris for talks.

Xinhua News Agency, 31st dispatch from Washington: US President Eisenhower announced at a press conference on October 30th that he is prepared to attend the highest-level meeting of the North Atlantic Group Council in December. He said that Council Chairman Spaak had issued an invitation and he intends to accept it. Eisenhower said he hoped the upcoming summit meeting of the group would strengthen "cooperation" among the North Atlantic Treaty countries in science and technology, so that the effectiveness of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization could be further expanded.

Eisenhower also said that after attending the North Atlantic Treaty Organization meeting, he hoped to stay in Britain for a while. But whether this can be arranged is still a question.

    商议加紧从事核军备竞赛
    北大西洋集团将开首脑会议
    艾森豪威尔将亲自出马
    新华社31日讯　巴黎消息：北大西洋集团理事会常任代表10月30日举行会议后正式宣布，这个集团订于12月举行的理事会会议将是政府首脑级会议。这个集团的一个发言人证实，美国总统艾森豪威尔将前往参加这个会议。
    英国和美国在华盛顿会谈中所以决定匆促间召开这样一次会议，是想安定一下西方世界对苏联在科学上的巨大进展所表现的惊慌心情。
    据透露，这次会议将优先讨论集合西方人力、物力来从事核军备竞赛问题。此外，会议还将研究英国裁减人力而更多地依靠核武器的计划和北大西洋集团最高统帅诺斯塔德草拟的一项新“防御”计划。
    近两天来，西方国家环绕这次会议不断进行活动。在华盛顿，艾森豪威尔召见了诺斯塔德来商讨北大西洋集团的一些问题。国务院也召集了美国驻北大西洋集团十四个成员国的使节向他们传达12月举行的会议的计划。
    在西欧，西德总理阿登纳决定出席首脑级会议，他还要在会议前去英国同麦克米伦会谈。有消息说，一俟法国新政府组成，麦克米伦将去巴黎会谈。
    新华社31日讯　华盛顿消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔10月30日在记者招待会上宣布，他准备参加北大西洋集团理事会在12月间召开的最高级会议。他说，理事会主席斯巴克已经发出邀请，他打算接受这个邀请。艾森豪威尔说，他希望即将举行的这个集团的最高级会议将能加强北大西洋公约国家之间在科学技术方面的“合作”，使北大西洋公约组织的效用能够进一步扩大。
    艾森豪威尔又说，在参加北大西洋公约组织的会议后，他希望能够去英国停留一下。但是能否这样安排目前还是个问题。
