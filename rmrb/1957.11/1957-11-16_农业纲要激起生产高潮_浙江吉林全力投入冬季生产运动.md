    Agricultural Program Spurs Production Upsurge
    Zhejiang and Jilin Fully Invested in Winter Production Campaign

    According to Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou: Early start, large scale, and quick action are the main characteristics of Zhejiang Province's current production. The sowing season for more than 24 million mu of winter crops such as wheat, rapeseed, and green manure in the province generally started half a month earlier than last year. Winter sowing has been more than half completed in most areas. While carrying out autumn harvest and winter planting, agricultural cooperatives in various places started water conservancy construction early. In Jinhua Special District, 952 water conservancy projects started one month ahead of schedule. The construction of medium and small-sized reservoirs distributed in mountainous and semi-mountainous areas is progressing rapidly. In the past half month, 700 reservoirs have been under construction, and 20 small reservoirs have been completed ahead of schedule. Many agricultural cooperatives in various regions have launched fertilizer accumulation activities for next year's production. Eight agricultural cooperatives in Lantang Township, Yuyao, mobilized more than 200 boats to accumulate fertilizer more than 200 li away. In Pingyang Yi District, Wenzhou, some agricultural cooperative members crossed the Ao River, climbed mountains and ridges, and tried every means to find fertilizer sources.

    The socialist propaganda and education and the promulgation of the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) have become a huge force in promoting various productions. The winter sowing area in the province will expand by about 2.4 million mu compared with last year. Many areas have changed the phenomenon of not paying attention to winter sowing through major debates on winter sowing production. In Majian Township, Lanxi County, some farmers were initially unwilling to plant wheat, believing that winter sowing was not as cost-effective as engaging in sideline occupations; after fierce debates, the winter sowing area expanded by more than 500 mu.

    During the autumn harvest and winter sowing, many government cadres at the provincial, county, district, and township levels in Zhejiang Province, led by leading comrades, went to the cooperatives to directly participate in labor production. The first batch of more than 600 cadres from county-level organs in five counties including Xinchang, Xuanping, and Fenghua went to the cooperatives to work and produce, which further stimulated the production enthusiasm of the masses.

Xinhua News Agency, Changchun: The winter production upsurge in Jilin Province arrived more than a month earlier than last year. At present, the province mobilizes 460,000 people every day to engage in water conservancy construction, accumulate manure, and manage sideline occupations.

    The characteristics of this year's winter production in Jilin Province are: early start, high enthusiasm of the masses, high labor attendance rate, and fast production progress. In terms of water conservancy construction, more than 260 projects have been repaired, with an irrigation area of more than 3,400 hectares; more than 900 projects are under construction, which can expand the irrigation area by more than 1,700 hectares. The accumulation of manure has completed 60% of the plan.

    The winter production upsurge in Jilin Province was launched on the basis of discussing the revised draft of the Agricultural Development Program and carrying out a major socialist debate. Various places have put forward various specific slogans according to local conditions to encourage the enthusiasm of the masses.

    农业纲要激起生产高潮
    浙江吉林全力投入冬季生产运动
    据新华社杭州电　动手早、规模大、行动快，是浙江省当前生产的主要特点。全省二千四百多万亩大小麦、油菜、绿肥等冬季作物，播种季节普遍比去年提早半个月。大部地区冬种已经完成一半以上。各地农业社一面进行秋收冬种，一面提早动工兴修水利。金华专区有九百五十二处水利工程已提前一月动工。分布在山区、半山区的中、小型水库兴修工程，进度迅速，近半月来，正在兴修的水库就有七百处，其中二十处小型水库已提前完成。许多地区农业社已为明年生产展开了积肥活动。余姚兰塘乡的八个农业社，就开动了二百多只船到二百里路以外去积肥。温州地区的平阳宜山区，有些农业社社员渡过鳌江，爬山越岭，千方百计寻找肥源。
    社会主义宣传教育和全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）的公布，已成为推动各项生产的巨大力量。全省冬种面积将比去年扩大二百四十万亩左右。很多地区通过了冬种生产的大辩论，已改变了不重视冬种的现象。兰溪县马涧乡起初有部分农民不愿种大小麦，认为冬种不如搞副业合算；经过激烈辩论，结果冬种面积扩大了五百多亩。
    在秋收冬种当中，浙江省地、县、区、乡很多机关干部以领导同志为首，纷纷下社直接参加劳动生产。新昌、宣平、奉化等五个县的县级机关第一批即有六百多个干部下社劳动生产，更加激发了群众的生产劲头。
    新华社长春电　吉林省冬季生产高潮比去年提前一个多月到来。目前，全省每天出动兴修水利、积攒粪肥、经营副业的人达四十六万。
    吉林省今年冬季生产的特点是：动手早，群众劲头大，劳动出勤率高，生产进度快。在水利建设方面，已经修补二百六十多处工程，灌溉面积达三千四百多公顷；正在施工的有九百多处，可以扩大灌溉面积一千七百多公顷。积攒粪肥已完成计划的60％。
    吉林省的冬季生产高潮，是在讨论农业发展纲要修正草案和进行社会主义大辩论的基础上开展起来的。各地都根据当地情况提出各种具体口号，以鼓动群众的积极性。
