Xinhua News Agency Report: The big-character posters at the Institute of Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences exposed the serious situation of scientific workers wasting and stockpiling equipment.

A researcher, in order to suspend a large magnet indoors, ordered an electric crane worth 13,660 yuan, which was due to arrive in the fourth quarter. However, instead of welcoming its arrival, people became anxious. It turned out to be a huge object, weighing three tons and capable of lifting one ton, totaling four tons. Such a crane cannot be used in the laboratory. According to needs, the Institute of Physics only needed to purchase a manual hoist crane, which can lift one and a half tons and costs only 160 yuan.

In 1956, the Isotope Storage Room of the Institute of Physics received a large batch of "Carbon-14" isotopes of unknown origin, worth 1,021,580 yuan. It has been shelved for a year, and it is still unknown what it was bought for.

On one occasion, the Institute of Physics purchased 103 vacuum tubes, which were抢光d by various units within the institute in three days. When other equipment arrives, everyone always争抢s for it, the more the better. Regardless of whether they need it, they put it in their small warehouses after争抢ing it. After everyone criticized it in this 放鸣, some scientists' departmentalism and the erroneous idea of not cherishing state property have been greatly improved.

### 物理研究所浪费器材  不管是否需要　大家总争着要

    物理研究所浪费器材
    不管是否需要　大家总争着要
    据新华社讯　中国科学院物理研究所的大字报揭露了科学工作者浪费和积压器材的严重情况。
    有位研究员为了在室内吊动大磁铁，订购了一架价值一万三千六百六十元的电动起重机，第四季度内就要到货了，可是人们不是欢迎它的到来，反而惶恐起来了。原来它是一个庞然大物，自重三吨，起重一吨，共四吨，这样的起重机是不能在实验室内使用的。按照需要，物理所购买一架手动葫芦起重机就行了，它可以起重一吨半，价格只有一百六十元。
    1956年，物理研究所同位素保管室收到了一大批来历不明的“碳十四”同位素，价值一百零二万一千五百八十元。搁置了一年之久，还不知道买来干什么的。
    有一次物理所购到了一百零三只真空管，在三天中所内各单位就一争而光。其他的器材购到的时候，大家也总是争着要，越多越好。不管自己是否需要，争到手以后，就放在自己的小仓库里。在这次鸣放中大家提出批评后，有些科学家的本位主义和不爱惜国家财产的错误思想已大有改进。
