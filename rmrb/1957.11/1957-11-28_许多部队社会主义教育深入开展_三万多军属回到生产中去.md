Xinhua News Agency, 27th - With the deepening of the rectification movement and socialist education movement, a wave of military officers' dependents returning home to produce and participate in socialist construction has begun to take shape in many units of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. According to incomplete statistics from the leading organs of troops stationed in Beijing, Jinan, Guangzhou, Chengdu, Fuzhou, Wuhan, Lanzhou and other places, as well as fourteen units including the Armored Corps, Engineering Corps, Railway Corps, Artillery Corps stationed in Beijing, and the General Headquarters of the People's Liberation Army, by mid-month, more than 20,000 households of military officers' dependents had returned to production, totaling more than 36,000 people. Among them, the 4th Detachment of a certain unit has achieved the best results, with the dependents returning home accounting for 81% of the total number of dependents accompanying the military. In a certain unit, the dependents who have already returned home and signed up to return home account for more than 95% of the total number of dependents accompanying the military. At present, in all units of the army, more and more dependents are signing up and setting off to return home for production every day and every hour.

The call to mobilize military dependents to return home for production, employment, settlement, and participation in socialist construction was first proposed by Marshal Peng Dehuai at a meeting of military cadres stationed in Shijiazhuang in August this year. In September this year, the organizational work conference held by the General Political Department also put forward this revolutionary measure. This measure was quickly and enthusiastically supported by leaders at all levels, the vast number of military officers and their families throughout the army. Party committees and leading organs at all levels have held meetings, made resolutions, and ensured the success of this work. Many troops have made mobilizing military officers' dependents to return home for production one of the important contents of rectification, and have conducted in-depth and meticulous ideological education work for the vast number of military officers and their families through big-character posters, symposiums, family meetings, individual conversations, etc., so that they can further understand the great significance and benefits of mobilizing their families to return home for production, and truly achieve a conscious and voluntary return to production. Before the families returned home, the leaders of many troops also personally visited each household, patiently helping them solve various specific difficulties and problems, and held various get-togethers, tea parties, and enthusiastic farewell meetings when the families set off to return home.

The vast number of military officers and their families throughout the army have responded to this call with practical actions. Some military officers in leading positions took the lead in signing up their families to return home for production. Many dependents from working women's backgrounds have warmly supported this correct measure of returning home for production. They have expressed that everyone is responsible for building socialism, and those of us who came from production should return to production and contribute our strength to socialism. At a meeting of family representatives held by a certain unit on the Fujian front line, when the leadership put forward the call to return home for production, more than 80% of the dependents signed up to return home on the spot. Zhang Lanfang, a military officer's dependent who was formerly a county labor model, excitedly stated when signing up to return home for production that she would always maintain the glorious title of labor model in the future. Many military officers' dependents also firmly stated when leaving the team that they would actively engage in production, manage their households diligently and frugally, and strive to make contributions and become models in labor after returning home.

    许多部队社会主义教育深入开展
    三万多军属回到生产中去
    新华社27日讯　随着整风运动和社会主义教育运动的深入开展，随军军官家属还乡生产，参加社会主义建设的热潮，已经在中国人民解放军许多部队中开始形成。驻北京、济南、广州、成都、福州、武汉、兰州等地部队领导机关和驻北京的装甲兵、工程兵、铁道兵、炮兵及解放军总部等十四个单位的不完全统计，到本月中旬，还乡生产的军官家属已有两万多户，三万六千多人。其中，成绩最好的某部四支队还乡家属已占随军家属总人数的81％，某部已经返乡和报名还乡的家属，已占随军家属总数95％以上。目前，全军各部队每天、每时都有越来越多的家属报名和启程还乡生产。
    动员随军家属还乡生产，劳动就业，安家落户，参加社会主义建设的号召，是今年8月彭德怀元帅在石家庄驻军干部会议上首次提出的。今年9月，总政治部召开的组织工作会议也提出了这个具有革命意义的措施。这个措施，迅速得到全军各级领导、广大军官和家属的热烈拥护和广泛支持。各级党委和领导机关都举行了会议，作出决议，保证作好这一工作。许多部队都把动员随军军官家属还乡生产，作为整改的重要内容之一，通过大字报、座谈会、家庭会、个别交谈等方式，对广大军官和家属进行深入细致的思想教育工作，使他们进一步领会动员家属回乡生产的重大意义和好处，真正作到自觉自愿地还乡生产。家属还乡前，许多部队的首长还亲自到各家各户访问，耐心地帮助他们解决各种具体困难问题，并且在家属启程还乡时举行了各种联欢会、茶话会和热烈的欢送大会。
    全军广大军官和家属纷纷以实际行动响应这一号召。一些担任领导职务的军官，带头为自己的家属报名回乡生产。许多劳动妇女出身的家属，更是热烈拥护回乡生产这一正确措施。她们纷纷表示，建设社会主义人人有责，我们从生产中来的应当回到生产中去，为社会主义贡献自己的力量，在福建前线某部召开的家属代表会上，当领导上提出还乡生产的号召后，当场就有80％以上的家属报名还乡。过去是县的劳动模范的军官家属张兰芳，在报名还乡生产时，还激动地表示今后要永远保持劳动模范的光荣称号。许多军官家属在离队时也都坚决地表示，回乡后一定积极生产，勤俭持家，争取在劳动中立功当模范。
