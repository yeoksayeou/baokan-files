Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 23rd: The more than 20,000 cadres in Shanxi Province who have been successively transferred to agricultural production positions this year have already made significant achievements in agricultural production.

The vast majority of cadres who have returned to production posts are able to put down their airs, humbly learn from the masses, and labor diligently. Many people, on their first day in the countryside, joined commune members in carrying manure, digging latrines, and going into the water to repair canals, undertaking the most arduous work. By the end of October, the 20,631 cadres who had been transferred had worked more than 2.28 million labor days, with the most working 260 labor days.

After this period of labor, many downward-transferred cadres have learned production techniques such as plowing, threshing, weeding, sowing, warm water seed soaking, and seed dressing with chemicals. Some have mastered the skills of running communes, such as contracting production to teams and flexible evaluation methods. Now, 90% of the downward-transferred cadres love the countryside and are settled into production. According to statistics from 53 counties, among the 8,954 cadres transferred, 4,862 have been elected by the peasants to concurrently serve as commune cadres, Party and League cadres, women's work cadres, and volunteer teachers in people's schools.

The actions of the downward-transferred cadres in laboring diligently have also reversed the idea of some people in the countryside who looked down on labor, and have established a new social ethos that labor is the most glorious. According to information from six counties including Ying County and Xiyang, the original 7,569 commune cadres, middle and primary school graduates, and young commune members who were not settled in agricultural production and wanted to enter the city as workers or cadres have now settled down and actively participate in agricultural production.

    放下架子　刻苦劳动
    山西省下放干部安心农业生产
    新华社太原23日电　山西省今年陆续下放到农业生产岗位上的两万多名干部，已经在农业生产上做出了显著成绩。
    回到生产岗位的绝大多数干部，都能放下架子，虚心向群众学习，刻苦地进行劳动。有很多人头一天到农村，第二天就和社员一起担大粪、挖茅坑、下水修渠，担负最艰苦的工作。到10月底止，下放的两万零六百三十一名干部已作了二百二十八万多个劳动日，其中最多的做了二百六十个劳动日。
    经过这一段时间的劳动以后，不少下放干部已经学会了犁地、打场、锄苗、下种、温汤浸种、药剂拌种等生产技术，有的已掌握了包工包产、死分活评等办社本领。现在90％的下放干部已经热爱农村，安心生产。据五十三个县的统计，下放的八千九百五十四名干部中，被农民选出兼任社干部、党团干部、妇女工作干部和民校义务教员等职的达四千八百六十二人。
    下放干部刻苦劳动的行动，还扭转了农村中一部分人轻视劳动的想法，树立了劳动最光荣的新风尚。据应县、昔阳等六个县了解，原有的七千五百六十九名不安心农业生产，想进城当工人、当干部的社干部、中小学毕业生和青年社员，现在都安定下来，积极参加了农业生产。
