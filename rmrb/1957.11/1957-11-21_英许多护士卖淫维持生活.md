So-Called “Free World”

    London Dispatch: Mrs. Ravi Bonde, a member of the government agency, the Wolfenden Committee, which is investigating homosexuality and prostitution in Britain, said that many British nurses are forced by life to prostitute themselves once a week to make up for insufficient wages.
    Ravi Bonde said at a meeting of the Anglican Diocese of London that she was "horrified to hear the police say that many nurses come to London to prostitute themselves overnight."
    She said that there are all kinds of women who prostitute themselves. One she recently met was the daughter of a member of the clergy, who had obtained a degree from Oxford University.

    英许多护士卖淫维持生活
    伦敦消息：调查英国同性爱和娼妓情况的政府机构沃耳芬登委员会委员拉维邦德夫人说，英国有许多护士为生活所迫，不得不每周卖淫一次，以弥补工资收入的不足。
    拉维邦德在圣公会伦敦主教区会议上说，她“听到警察说许多护士到伦敦来过夜卖淫，感到可怕。”
    她说，卖淫的有各式各样的妇女。她最近遇到的一个，就是牧师会会员的女儿，她曾经在牛津大学取得学位。
