Xinhua News Agency, 10th dispatch from Paris: The French cabinet passed a bill on the 9th demanding that Parliament grant special powers to cope with France's increasingly serious financial crisis and inflation. The bill includes levying an additional 100 billion francs in new taxes and reducing budget expenditures by another 100 billion francs in order to reduce the 1958 budget deficit from 800 billion francs to 600 billion francs.

The bill requests authorization for the Minister of Finance to further tighten expenditures, levy new taxes, curb foreign exchange consumption, and control "illegal" price increases in the future, without having to obtain prior parliamentary approval.

In addition, the bill also stipulates that the government has the right to oppose any expenditures exceeding the 1958 budget.

It is believed that the government's bill is actually aimed at abolishing the National Assembly's supervisory power over the national finances for 1958.

The bill will be submitted to the National Assembly for debate on the 13th. Sources say that Gaillard is prepared to request a vote of confidence when the bill is put to a vote.

Prior to this, on the 7th, the National Assembly approved by a vote of 375 to 150 the cabinet's measure to borrow another 250 billion francs from the Bank of France to meet the urgent needs of the national treasury. Including this new loan, the total amount of loans the French government has borrowed from the Bank of France this year has reached 550 billion francs.

Xinhua News Agency, 10th dispatch from Paris: The French Ministry of the Interior held a special meeting on the 8th and decided to take several new special measures to suppress North Africans residing in mainland France.

On the same day, the Internal Affairs Committee of the French National Assembly passed a bill granting the Prime Minister special powers in mainland France and Algeria.

    法国新阁刚上台就下大赌注
    要求议会授予财政方面特别权力
    决定加紧镇压居住法国的北非人
    新华社10日讯　巴黎消息：法国内阁9日通过了一项要求议会授予特别权力以应付法国日趋严重的财政危机和通货膨胀的法案。法案内容包括再征收一千亿法郎的新税和再缩减一千亿法郎的预算开支，以便把1958年度的预算赤字从八千亿法郎减到六千亿法郎。
    法案要求授权财政部长今后能够进一步紧缩开支、征收新税、制止外汇消耗和控制“非法”抬高物价，不必再事先征得议会同意。
    另外，法案还规定政府可以有权反对超出1958年度预算之外的任何支出。
    人们认为，政府这个法案实际上是要取消国民议会对1958年度国家财政的监督权。
    法案将在13日提交国民议会辩论。有消息说，盖伊阿准备在对这个法案进行表决时要求信任投票。
    在这以前，国民议会在7日以三百七十五票对一百五十票批准了内阁所采取的再向法兰西银行借款二千五百亿法郎以应国库急需的措施。连同这一笔新借款，今年以来法国政府向法兰西银行借款总额已经达到五千五百亿法郎。
    据新华社10日讯　巴黎消息：法国政府内政部8日举行特别会议，决定采取若干新的特别措施来镇压居住在法国本土的北非人。
    同一天，法国国民议会内政委员会通过了授予总理在法国本土及阿尔及利亚以特别权力的法案。
