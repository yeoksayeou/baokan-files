Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 18th - The Mujiazhuang Agricultural Cooperative in Zhongyang County, Shanxi Province, has created a new method for accumulating fertilizer in mountainous areas. This method is called "fertilizer accumulation and water storage pit" by local farmers.

The Xiazaolin Township, where the Mujiazhuang Agricultural Cooperative is located, is in a loess mountainous area, with 98% of the township's cultivated land on the mountains. This summer, in order to change the situation of low yields due to the inconvenience of transporting fertilizer and the small amount of fertilizer applied, the cooperative members began to choose places where water could accumulate on hillsides, field edges, and corners, and dug pits according to the terrain. They layered soil and straw, using them to hold and soak floodwater when it rained. When there was little rain and a shortage of water, they adopted the method of smoking fertilizer. In this way, a large amount of fertilizer was stored for autumn wheat planting.

According to the experience of the Mujiazhuang Agricultural Cooperative, adopting this method of accumulating fertilizer on the spot can solve the difficulties in transporting fertilizer and straw on steep mountain slopes; reduce labor and heavy physical labor in transporting fertilizer, and lower fertilizer prices; and also retain floodwater, playing a role in water conservation, soil conservation, and fertilizer conservation.

### 中阳县穆家庄社  创造山区积肥新办法

    创造山区积肥新办法
    新华社太原18日电　山西省中阳县穆家庄农业社创造出一种山区积肥的新办法，这种办法被当地农民称为“积肥蓄水坑”。
    穆家庄农业社所在的下枣林乡地处黄土山区，全乡98％的耕地在山上。今年夏天社员们为改变当地因运肥不方便、施肥少产量不高的情况，开始在山坡、田边、地角选择能聚水的地方，根据地势挖成坑，一层土一层秸秆铺好，下雨时拦蓄洪水沤泡；在雨少缺水时便采取熏肥的办法。这样，为秋季种麦贮备了大量肥料。
    根据穆家庄农业社的经验，采取这种办法就地积肥，既可解决山地陡坡运送肥料和秸秆上的困难；减少运肥用工和繁重的体力劳动，降低肥价；还可拦蓄洪水，起到保水、保土和保肥的作用。
