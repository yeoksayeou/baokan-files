Snippets of Soviet Union Welcoming the Holiday

    Printing Recordings of Lenin's Speeches
    To celebrate the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution, the Soviet Union is printing microgroove records of seven of Lenin's speeches for the first time. The recordings reproduce Lenin's following speeches: "What is Soviet Power?", "Message to the Red Army," "On the Middle Peasants," "How to Free the Working People Forever from the Oppression of Landlords and Capitalists," "In Memory of Comrade Yakov Mikhailovich Sverdlov, Chairman of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee," "The Third International - Communist International," "Notification on Telephone Communication with Bela Kun via Radio."
    The microgroove records made now are much better than those printed in the past, and Lenin's voice sounds very clear.
    Talking Letters and Telegrams with Photos
    During the celebration of the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution, relatives and friends from all over the country will write letters and send telegrams to each other to congratulate the holiday and inquire about their health. In order to better serve the general public, the postal and telecommunications departments in Moscow have expanded a new business: sending talking letters and sending telegrams with photos. People who send letters can go to a special studio on Gorky Street to speak their words to their relatives, record them on tape with a tape recorder, and send them in an envelope. The recipient only needs to put the tape on a gramophone to play it and hear the voices of relatives or friends. In addition, people can also send their photos to relatives and friends together with telegrams by facsimile.
    Rushing to Repair the Moscow Ring Road
    In order to welcome the October Revolution Day, the builders of Moscow are carrying out a socialist competition to build the ring road. In recent years, no less than 60,000 cars have passed through Moscow from other places every day. Therefore, the vehicles on the streets of Moscow are relatively crowded, which reduces the speed of the vehicles. In order to allow these vehicles to bypass the city, Moscow decided to build a ring road with a total length of 109 kilometers, which connects the ten major highways leading to Moscow from the outer city.

    苏联迎接节日花絮
    印制列宁演说的录音片
    为庆祝十月革命四十周年，苏联首次印制了列宁七个演说密纹录音片。录音片上再现列宁的下列演说：“什么是苏维埃政权？”“告红军书”，
  “论中农”，“怎样使劳动人民永远摆脱地主资本家的压迫”，“悼念全俄中央执行委员会主席雅柯夫·米哈依洛维奇·斯维德洛夫同志”，“第三国际——共产国际”，“关于用无线电同贝拉·库恩通话的通报”。
    现在制成的密纹录音片比过去印制的好得多，列宁的声音听起来非常明朗和清晰。
    说话的信和带像片的电报
    在庆祝十月革命四十周年时，各地的亲人和朋友都要互相写信和打电报祝贺节日，问候健康。莫斯科的邮电部门为了更好地为广大市民服务，特扩大举办一项新业务：——寄送说话的信件和拍发带像片的电报。寄信的人可以到高尔基大街特设的工作室，把想要和亲人讲的话讲出来，用录音机录在胶纸上，装在信封里寄出。收信人只须把胶纸放在留声机上开放，就可以听到亲人或朋友的声音。另外，人们还可把自己的像片和电报一起用传真的办法拍发给亲人和朋友。
    赶修莫斯科环城公路
    莫斯科的建设者为了迎接十月革命节，正在进行建设环城公路的社会主义竞赛，近年来，每天由外地途经莫斯科的汽车不下六万辆，因此，莫斯科街道上的车辆比较拥挤，减低了车辆行驶速度。为了使这些车辆可以绕城而过，莫斯科决定兴建全长一百零九公里的环城公路，它连接着外城通往莫斯科的十条大公路。　　（新华社）
