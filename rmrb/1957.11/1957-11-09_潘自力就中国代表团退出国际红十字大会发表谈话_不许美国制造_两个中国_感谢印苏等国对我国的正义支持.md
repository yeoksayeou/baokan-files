Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, November 7th. Pan Zili, head of the Chinese government delegation, made a statement at a press conference held in New Delhi on the afternoon of November 7, after the Chinese delegation withdrew from the 19th International Red Cross Conference. The full text is as follows:

　　The Chinese delegation, in order to protest against the U.S. delegation's forcing the conference to adopt a U.S. proposal that violates the "International Red Cross Charter" and conspires to create "Two Chinas," has announced its withdrawal from the 19th International Red Cross Conference.

　　The occurrence of this matter is regrettable, but it is not unexpected by us.

　　Ever since the Standing Committee of the International Red Cross decided in September 1955 to invite the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek Group to attend this conference under the names of "Formosa Government" and "Formosa Red Cross," we have continuously opposed and demanded the revocation of this decision, which blatantly violates the "International Red Cross Charter." We also frankly told the relevant parties our opinions, pointing out that this is a decision that is conducive to creating "Two Chinas," that the U.S. aim is to create "Two Chinas," and that this is something we absolutely cannot agree to. However, our opinions have not received due attention. Many people may have thought that what was invited this time was the "Formosa Government," rather than the so-called "Republic of China Government," which had long been overthrown by the 600 million Chinese people and had lost any representation, and therefore would not constitute "Two Chinas." Now, the facts prove that this view is extremely wrong. What the U.S. has done at this conference is a profound lesson for many people. There is only one China, and that is the People's Republic of China. If anyone thinks that besides this China, which truly represents the Chinese people, there is another China of some kind, then they will only fall into the trap of the U.S. policy of hostility towards the Chinese people. It's one or the other; there is no middle ground.

　　We expected the U.S. to do this a long time ago. Why? Because, as people can see, the People's Republic of China is developing and growing stronger day by day. The fact that the New China stands tall cannot be changed by the U.S. attitude towards the New China. The Chinese people oppose the U.S. policy of hostility towards the New China, but they are not at all eager for the U.S. to recognize the People's Republic of China. In fact, the U.S. adoption of such a policy does not harm the existence and development of the New China in the slightest; what is harmed is the U.S. itself. Today, the central issue in Sino-U.S. relations is not that the New China is eager to obtain U.S. recognition, but that the U.S. is trying to obtain China's recognition of its occupation of Taiwan; that is, to create "Two Chinas" and find a way out for its bankrupt China policy. It tried to achieve this goal in a roundabout way in the Sino-U.S. ambassadorial talks in Geneva, but we blocked it. It hasn't it tried to do this in the United Nations as well, but it hasn't been able to turn around for a while because its China policy is too rigid. Therefore, the easier way is to first create a situation of "Two Chinas" in other international conferences and international organizations where this can be done, and slowly create a situation of "Two Chinas." The International Red Cross Conference is one of the venues it has chosen. As we have repeatedly stated solemnly, we absolutely cannot agree to this U.S. practice. In the final analysis, even if the U.S. does not recognize the New China for a hundred years, and the New China cannot participate in any international conferences and international organizations, we cannot recognize that the U.S. occupation of Taiwan is legal, and we cannot allow a situation of "Two Chinas" to appear in any international conferences or international organizations that we participate in. This is our position.

　　The delegation of the Government of the People's Republic of China and the delegation of the Chinese Red Cross came to participate in this International Red Cross Conference with the good intention of promoting international cooperation on the basis of mutual respect. Although we had to withdraw from the meeting due to the sabotage and obstruction of the U.S. and its followers, we do not think that our participation was in vain; we believe that we have gained something. During our participation, we received warm hospitality from the host country of this conference—India, the great neighbor of New China—and the Indian Red Cross Society. In our struggle against the U.S. conspiracy to create "Two Chinas," we have

    潘自力就中国代表团退出国际红十字大会发表谈话
    不许美国制造“两个中国”
    感谢印苏等国对我国的正义支持
    新华社新德里7日电　中国政府代表团团长潘自力在中国代表团退出第十九届国际红十字大会以后，11月7日下午在新德里举行的记者招待会上发表了谈话，全文如下：
    中国代表团为了抗议美国代表团强迫大会通过违反“国际红十字章程”和阴谋制造“两个中国”的美国提案，已经宣布退出第十九届国际红十字大会。
    这件事的发生是令人遗憾的，但是并不是出于我们意料的。
    自从1955年9月国际红十字常设委员会决定邀请台湾蒋介石集团用“福摩萨政府”和“福摩萨红十字会”的名义出席这次大会的时候起，我们就不断反对和要求撤销这个公然违反“国际红十字章程”的决定。我们并且把我们的意见坦率地告诉了有关方面，指出这是一个有利于制造“两个中国”的决定，美国的目的就是要制造“两个中国”，而这是我们绝对不能同意的。但是我们的意见没有得到应有的重视。不少人也许以为这次邀请的是“福摩萨政府”，而不是早已被六亿中国人民推翻、失去任何代表性的所谓“中华民国政府”，因而不会构成“两个中国”。现在，事实证明，这个观点是极端错误的。美国在这次大会上的所作所为对于许多人是一次深刻的教训。中国只有一个，这就是中华人民共和国。如果有人以为在这个真正代表中国人民的中国以外，还有一个什么中国，那么只会让自己陷进美国敌视中国人民的政策的圈套。二者必居其一，中间的道路是没有的。
    美国这样做，是我们早就料到的。为什么？因为，人们都可以看到，八年来中华人民共和国一天天在发展和壮大。新中国屹然存在的事实绝不是美国对新中国的态度所能改变的。中国人民反对美国敌视新中国的政策，但是一点也不稀罕美国对中华人民共和国的承认。其实美国采取这样的政策丝毫也损害不了新中国的存在和发展，受到损害的倒是美国自己。今天中美关系中的中心问题并不是新中国急于取得美国的承认，而是美国力图取得中国对它侵占台湾的承认；这就是制造“两个中国”，为它那破产了的对华政策找下台。它在日内瓦中美大使级会谈中转弯抹角地想实现这个企图，被我们挡住了。它在联合国也何尝不想这样做，只是因为它的对华政策太僵化了，一时还转不过来。因此，比较容易的办法是先在其他可以这样做的国际会议和国际组织中搞起“两个中国”的局面，慢慢地造成“两个中国”的形势。国际红十字大会是它选中的场所之一。美国的这种作法，正如我们历次郑重表示过的，我们是绝对不能同意的。说到底，即使美国一百年不承认新中国，新中国不能参加任何一个国际会议和国际组织，我们也不能承认美国侵占我国台湾是合法的，我们也不能容许在任何我们所参加的国际会议或国际组织中有“两个中国”的局面出现。这就是我们的立场。
    中华人民共和国政府代表团和中国红十字会代表团是抱着在互相尊重的基础上促进国际合作的良好愿望来参加这一次国际红十字大会的。尽管由于美国及其追随者的破坏和阻挠，使我们不能不退出会议，我们并不认为我们的参加是白费的，我们认为我们是有收获的。在我们的与会期间，我们得到了本届大会的东道国家——新中国的伟大邻邦印度政府和印度红十字会的热诚的招待。在我们反对美国制造“两国中国”阴谋的斗争中，我们又得到许多国家代表团的支持，如苏联、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利、罗马尼亚、保加利亚、阿尔巴尼亚、南斯拉夫、德意志民主共和国、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、越南民主共和国、蒙古人民共和国、印度、印度尼西亚、叙利亚、埃及，特别是我们要向我们的主人、印度红十字会主席阿姆里特·考尔女士主持正义的精神表示感激。在我们同各方面的接触中，我们知道即便是在一些不支持我们的国家和红十字会代表团中，也有很多人士是主持正义和支持我们的正义立场的。在临别的时候，我们愿乘此机会向所有对新中国友好的国家和人士表示衷心的感谢。
    谢谢你们。
