Following the release of the "Decision on Launching a Large-Scale Farmland Water Conservancy and Manure Accumulation Campaign in the Coming Winter and Spring" by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, and the communication of the Eighth Central Committee's Third Plenary Session's agricultural development policy, many provinces and regions across the country are now ushering in a high tide of large-scale water conservancy construction. This is the first piece of good news on the agricultural production front this winter and spring, and a good start to striving to achieve the agricultural production increase targets of the Second Five-Year Plan.

The first year after the basic completion of agricultural cooperativization in our country saw the emergence of the first high tide of water conservancy construction. Since then, many regions have made significant achievements in mass water conservancy construction. The reports published in this newspaper today regarding the harnessing of the Mang River in the Jiyuan area of Henan, and the reports published on October 22nd regarding the conquest of low-lying land in the Tianjin area of Hebei Province, both illustrate that not only have there been instances of individual cooperatives and townships achieving significant leaps in production due to water conservancy construction, but also that typical examples like the Mang River basin and the Tianjin area have emerged where entire basins and areas have greatly increased production as a result of water conservancy. These typical examples all demonstrate the tremendous advantages of our country's agricultural cooperative system. In the era of small-scale peasant economy, it was impossible to mobilize manpower, materials, and financial resources on a large scale among the masses to carry out large-scale farmland water conservancy projects over large areas due to the dispersion of land and labor; cooperativization has provided ample conditions for this. In the era of small-scale peasant economy, due to the weakness of individual economic strength, attending to capital construction meant neglecting current production, which greatly limited the combination of water conservancy construction and current production; after cooperativization, it became possible to closely integrate water conservancy construction with current production, and to closely combine the personal interests of the masses with collective interests, and immediate interests with long-term interests. It is precisely because of this that a mass movement of water conservancy construction immediately unfolded in vast areas of our country after the basic realization of agricultural cooperativization.

In the mass movement of farmland water conservancy construction in the past few years, many regions have gained invaluable experience. There is now an urgent need to earnestly summarize these experiences, concentrate them, and use them to guide today's movement. Recently, many provinces and regions have convened water conservancy conferences to communicate and discuss the central government's policies, summarize many good experiences, and make specific arrangements for this work. From the experiences summarized by Henan and Hebei provinces, especially from the experiences of the Mang River basin and the Tianjin area, several points are particularly noteworthy.

The most important point: the vast majority of projects are small-scale, but the benefits are enormous. The Tianjin area has already transformed from a grain-deficient area to a surplus-grain area; in the Mang River basin, Meng County's grain output has already exceeded the requirements of the National Agricultural Development Program, and Jiyuan County's grain output has increased from more than 98 million jin in 1952 to more than 197 million jin in 1956. These achievements have been possible mainly because the masses have been mobilized to widely construct small-scale water conservancy projects. Small-scale water conservancy projects can not only be widely implemented, but also yield quick results and greatly save state investment. The harnessing of the Mang River only took four years and cost the state only 250,000 yuan; the transformation of low-lying land in the Tianjin area only took three years, with direct state investment of only 2.8 jiao per mu. Small-scale water conservancy projects are not very complex technically, the design is relatively simple, the site is easy to choose, it is not necessary to abandon cultivated land or relocate residents, and it is easy to closely integrate them with the current production of the masses. Therefore, it is easy to mobilize the masses to build these water conservancy projects, and it can be done more, faster, better, and more economically. Large-scale projects are the opposite: they require large state investments, are technically demanding, the site selection is more difficult, the construction time is long, they take a long time to become effective, and it is not easy to combine them with current production; therefore, it is impossible to do them more and faster. The central government's policy on water conservancy construction is: "Small-scale projects as the main focus, medium-sized projects as supplementary, and large-scale projects to be built where necessary and possible." This policy fully conforms to our country's current specific situation. At present, some comrades still take a skeptical attitude towards this policy; they do not object to it verbally, but in reality, they are not interested in small-scale projects, do not actively carry out relevant scientific research, and do not pay attention to helping the masses summarize existing experiences and guide the masses in building such projects. These comrades doubt the role of small-scale projects and worry that small-scale projects will be of no avail when particularly large floods arrive. Of course, it is undeniable that small-scale projects have certain limitations; they can only resist ordinary floods and droughts; in order to overcome the harm of particularly large floods, large-scale projects that are necessary and possible to build cannot be ignored either. However, it must not be ignored that in our country's current situation, striving to first eliminate ordinary floods and droughts is of great significance to the entire economic construction and people's lives.

Another point worth noting is that they have adhered to the policy of overall planning, comprehensive management, and centralized management. The Mang River basin and the Tianjin area, based on local natural conditions, have made overall plans for mountains, plains, low-lying lands, upstream, and downstream, and comprehensively utilized various projects. This is a method of controlling nature that starts from the investigation and research of the interrelationships of various natural conditions and uses a variety of projects adapted to local conditions. Facts have proven that as long as this is done, there will be good results. Some regions do not consider the interrelationships of various natural conditions, do not have unified planning, emphasize the singularity of projects, and carry out management in isolation; the result is often to combat drought when drought comes, prevent floods when floods come, and drain water when waterlogging occurs, passively responding and making it difficult to achieve the goal of rapid production increase. Some places have even caused production to decline or even increased water disputes. In the past, some places adopted a scattered management method; added up, it can be considered that they controlled a certain number of square kilometers of area; however, they could not point out the actually controlled areas. The management of the Mang River, on the other hand, followed the basin plan, adopted the method of combining slope and gully management, starting with tributaries and then moving to the main stream, concentrating efforts to successively advance on one small river after another. In this way, they moved from points to areas, controlling the entire Mang River basin in a few years, and playing a huge role in reducing drought in the upper reaches and floods in the lower reaches, and in the overall production development of the basin. The experience of centralized management can not only be applied to small rivers, but also be beneficial to the management of large rivers. Because large rivers are composed of more small rivers, as the saying goes, "A steady stream of trickles eventually becomes a river"; after every small river in the large river basin is well managed, the large river itself will also change. After the Mang River was managed, the amount of sediment flowing from the Mang River basin into the Yellow River was greatly reduced. It can be seen from this that selecting one or two tributaries with suitable conditions from the tributaries of large rivers, or from the tributaries of tributaries, and first concentrating efforts to manage them, and then promoting them to other tributaries after success, to cooperate with the state's large-scale projects for managing large rivers, will achieve twice the result with half the effort; this will also play a significant role in the effectiveness and longevity of large-scale projects.

The experiences of the Mang River basin and the Tianjin area also prove that in the movement of water conservancy construction, attention must be paid to comprehensive development and comprehensive utilization. We are not building projects for the sake of building projects, nor are we blindly pursuing the number of wells dug and canals opened. The purpose of water conservancy construction is to comprehensively develop production. The success of water conservancy construction in the Mang River basin and the Tianjin area lies in the fact that they have greatly increased grain production, and at the same time, forestry, animal husbandry, aquaculture, and so on have all greatly developed. From the beginning of their water conservancy construction, they had the idea of comprehensive development and comprehensive utilization. According to different natural conditions such as deep mountains, shallow mountains, hills, plains, and low-lying land, they used a variety of small-scale projects such as fish-scale pits, interception ditches, terraces, reservoirs, water cellars, channels, dikes, sluices, ditches, soil ridges, ridged fields, and terraced fields to plant crops adapted to local conditions. Using fish-scale pits and horizontal ditches to store water and accumulate soil can not only control soil erosion, but also plant trees and plant legume crops; closing mountains for afforestation and planting trees on barren mountains also cultivated pasture and developed animal husbandry; in hilly areas and slopes, terraces were renovated, and alfalfa was widely planted on field edges and soil ridges to develop pig farming; reservoirs can be used for fish farming, low-lying land can be converted into rice paddies, and lotus roots and reeds can be planted in ditches. They also used hydropower to build small power stations. In short, they fully utilized whatever conditions were available for developing production; if there were no conditions yet, they actively created conditions to utilize them. They all paid attention to controlling the water and turning water disasters into water conservancy. Some areas discharge water during the flood season, only draining and not storing, and then ask the state for water during drought; this practice reflects a lack of comprehensive utilization of water.

In carrying out the mass movement of water conservancy construction, it is very important to correctly solve some ideological understanding problems of cadres and the masses. Such as: Is it mainly small-scale projects or mainly large-scale projects? Relying on state investment or relying on the strength of the broad masses? Overall planning, comprehensive management, and centralized management, or treating the head when it hurts, treating the foot when it hurts, and dispersing management in a piecemeal manner? Comprehensive development and comprehensive utilization, combining water conservancy construction with current production, or only caring about water conservancy construction and not caring about current production, only caring about the mountains and not caring about the foot of the mountains, only caring about the upper reaches and not caring about the lower reaches, only caring about flood discharge and waterlogging removal and not caring about water storage and water use? These are fundamental ideological problems related to water conservancy construction, and they must be clearly resolved in order to ensure the smooth development of the water conservancy construction movement. The best way to solve these problems is to earnestly summarize local advanced experiences, organize visits, and展開辯論 (展开辩论 means "engage in debate"). Whether it is successful experience or failed lessons, every region has them, and they should be summarized and used to educate cadres and the masses. The first article of the "Decision on Launching a Large-Scale Farmland Water Conservancy and Manure Accumulation Campaign in the Coming Winter and Spring" by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council points out: "It is necessary to comprehensively summarize the experiences and lessons of the past few years, especially the high tide of water conservancy construction in the winter of 1955 and the spring of 1956." Many provinces and regions have already paid attention to this, which is good. What should be pointed out here is that do not stop at just summarizing some technical experiences; what is important is to find out the laws of the movement from the creative activities of the masses. Only in this way can we improve the thinking of cadres and the masses, clarify the direction, strengthen confidence, and further give play to their initiative and creativity. Of course, the technical experiences created by the masses are also rich and colorful, and water conservancy engineering technicians should be mobilized to conduct scientific summaries so as to improve and promote them.

Water conservancy construction is a key measure to ensure increased agricultural production, and it is a broad mass movement. Therefore, the secretaries must take action, the whole party must be mobilized, and the masses must be mobilized. The experiences of the Mang River basin and the Tianjin area and other places show that the task of water conservancy construction cannot be undertaken by only a few enthusiasts; it must rely on the entire party and strengthen the party's leadership. In the mass movement of water conservancy construction, there are not only many technical problems, but also many policy problems that need to be solved; many tasks require the vigorous cooperation and support of relevant departments; and extensive and in-depth ideological education work needs to be carried out among cadres and the masses. Some comrades feel that the current tasks are heavy and believe that emphasizing the secretary taking action is unrealistic. Yes, the current tasks are indeed heavy; the rural areas are undergoing a major debate, the grain and cotton procurement tasks in many areas have not yet been completed, the field management work of wheat needs to be strengthened, the rectification movement of organs below the county level is about to begin, agricultural production cooperatives need to be further rectified and consolidated, and the agricultural development plans of all levels below the province must be quickly started. These tasks must all be done well. However, it must also be understood that water conservancy construction is extremely important for the development of agricultural production, especially for striving for a bumper harvest in the next wheat season, and therefore must also be done well. This requires even more reliance on the party committees at all levels to make appropriate arrangements for the work, scientifically organize forces, and combine the various tasks in a planned manner. The party committees at all levels in the Tianjin area and the Mang River basin have personally grasped the work of water conservancy construction for several years, which has enabled production to develop and the relationship between the party and the masses to become closer. Doing so has not only not hindered other work, but has instead provided favorable conditions for doing other work well.

Judging from the situation across the country, the high tide of large-scale water conservancy construction this winter is three months earlier than in the winter of 1955. This is one of the most important parts of the production high tide that followed the high tide of the socialist education movement in our country's rural areas. This high tide has more favorable conditions compared to the first high tide of water conservancy construction. The first high tide of water conservancy construction arose in a situation where our country's agricultural cooperativization had just been basically completed and there was a lack of experience in water conservancy construction. Now our country's agricultural cooperativization has been going on for two years, the cooperatives have been further consolidated, the public accumulation that cooperatives can use for capital construction has increased, and the leading organs and the masses in various regions have also gained some experience in water conservancy construction and labor organization. After the great debate on the two roads, the socialist consciousness of the peasant masses has been greatly improved. All of these, taken together, are: earlier time, more experience, higher awareness, greater strength, and solid work. It can be expected that as long as we strengthen leadership and fully utilize the various favorable conditions, we will definitely achieve greater victories in this high tide of water conservancy construction than in the past.

### 推广先进经验，发动群众大兴水利

    推广先进经验，发动群众大兴水利
    中共中央和国务院发布“关于今冬明春大规模地开展兴修农田水利和积肥运动的决定”以及党的八届三中全会关于发展农业的方针下达以后，全国许多省、区正在掀起大兴水利的高潮。这是今冬明春农业生产战线上的第一个喜讯，是争取实现第二个五年计划农业增产任务的良好开端。
    我国农业合作化基本上完成以后的第一年，就出现了第一次兴修水利的高潮。从那以后，不少地区在群众性的水利建设方面已经有了显著的成就。本报今天发表的河南济源一带治理漭河等项报道，以及10月22日发表的河北天津专区征服洼地等项报道，都说明在我国各地不仅出现了一个社、一个乡由于兴修水利而使生产大跃进的事例，而且开始出现了像漭河流域和天津专区这样由于兴修水利而使得整个流域、整个专区大大增产的典型。这些典型事例，都说明了我国农业合作制度有巨大的优越性。在小农经济时代，由于土地、劳力的分散，要在群众中大规模地动员人力、物力、财力，在大面积上兴修农田水利工程，是不可能的；在合作化以后，就提供了充分的条件。在小农经济时代，由于个体经济力量的单薄，顾了基本建设就顾不了当前生产，使兴修水利和当前生产的结合受到很大的限制；在合作化以后，就可以把兴修水利和当前生产密切地结合起来，把群众的个人利益和集体利益、眼前利益和长远利益密切地结合起来。正是因为这样，所以在农业合作化基本实现以后，在我国广大地区立即展开了兴修水利的群众性运动。
    在过去几年兴修农田水利的群众性运动中间，许多地区已经取得十分宝贵的经验。现在迫切需要把这些经验认真地加以总结，把它集中起来，用以指导今天的运动。近来，不少省、区都召开了水利会议，传达和讨论了中央的方针，总结了许多好的经验，对这个工作作了具体部署。从河南、河北两省总结的经验来看，特别是从漭河流域和天津专区的经验来看，有几点十分值得重视。
    顶重要的一点：绝大部分工程是小型的，效益却是巨大的。天津专区已经由缺粮区变为余粮区；在漭河流域，孟县的粮产量已经超过全国农业发展纲要的要求，济源县的粮产量由1952年的九千八百多万斤增加到1956年的一亿九千七百万多斤，在“愚公移山”寓言中提到的王屋山上已经出现了亩产两千斤粮食的典型。能够取得这些成就，主要是因为发动群众普遍兴修了小型水利工程。小型水利工程不仅可以广泛举办，而且收效快，大大节省了国家投资。漭河的治理只花了四年时间，国家投资只二十五万元；天津专区的洼地改造只花了三年时间，国家对每亩地的直接投资仅两角八分。小型水利工程技术不很复杂，设计比较简单，地址容易选择，不必废弃耕地、迁移居民，同群众的当前生产也易于密切结合。因此，这种水利工程容易发动群众来兴修，能够做到多、快、好、省。大型工程则与此相反，国家投资大，技术性高，地址选择较难，施工时间长，生效慢，不容易和当前生产相结合，因此，就不可能多和快。中央规定的关于水利建设的方针是：“小型为主，中型为辅，必要和可能的条件下兴修大型工程。”这个方针完全符合我国当前的具体情况。目前，有些同志对这个方针仍然采取半信半疑的态度，他们口头上不反对，实际上对小型工程却不感兴趣，不积极进行有关的科学研究工作，不注意帮助群众总结已有的经验和指导群众兴修这种工程。这些同志怀疑小型工程的作用，耽心在特大洪水到来的时候小型工程无济于事。当然，不可否认，小型工程是有一定的局限性的，它只能抵抗普通的水旱灾害；为了克服特大洪水的危害，对于必要和可能兴修的大型工程也是不能忽视的。但是，决不可忽视，在我国目前情况下，争取首先消灭普通水旱灾害，对整个经济建设和人民生活都有重大的意义。
    又有一点值得注意的，就是他们坚持执行了全面规划、综合治理、集中治理的方针。漭河流域和天津专区，根据当地自然条件，对于山上、山下、平原、洼地、上游、下游，全面地作出规划，综合地利用各项工程。这是从各种自然条件相互关系的调查研究出发，因地制宜地运用多种多样的工程来控制自然的方法。事实证明，只要这样做，就会有好的效果。有的地区不考虑各种自然条件的相互关系，没有统一规划，强调工程的单一化，孤立地进行治理；其结果往往是旱来抗旱，洪来防洪，涝了排涝，被动招架，难于达到迅速增产的目的，有些地方反而使生产下降，甚至增加了水利纠纷。过去有些地方采取零零星星地分散治理的办法，加起来计算，也算是控制了多少平方公里的面积；但是，却指不出实际控制的地区。漭河的治理，则是按照流域规划，采取坡沟兼治、先支后干的办法，集中力量对一条小河又一条小河依次进军。这样就由点到面，在几年时间内控制了整个漭河流域，对减少上游的旱灾和下游的涝灾，对整个流域的生产发展，都起了巨大的作用。集中治理的经验，不仅可以用之于小河，对治理大河也是有益的。因为大河是由更多的小河组成的，正所谓“涓涓不绝，终成江河”；把大河流域的每一条小河都治理好以后，大河本身也就会发生变化。漭河治理后，由漭河流域注入黄河的泥沙就大大减少了。由此可见，在大河的支流中，或在支流的支流中，选择一两条具有条件的支流首先集中力量治理，待成功后就推广到其它支流，以配合国家治理大河的大型工程，将会收事半功倍之效；这对大型工程的效果和寿命的延长，也将起显著的作用。
    漭河流域和天津专区的经验还证明了：在兴修水利的运动中，必须注意全面开发，综合利用。我们不是为修工程而修工程，不是盲目追求打井、开渠的数目字。兴修水利工程的目的在于全面地发展生产。漭河流域和天津专区兴修水利的成功，正在于他们大大增加了粮食产量，同时使林业、牧畜业、水产业等等都有了很大的发展。他们在兴修水利之初，就具有全面开发、综合利用的思想。他们根据深山、浅山、丘陵、平原、洼地等不同的自然条件，用鱼鳞坑、截水沟、梯田、水库、水窖、渠道、堤堰、水闸、沟洫、土埂、畦田、台田等多种多样的小型工程，因地制宜地种植作物。利用鱼鳞坑、水平沟蓄水积土，不仅可以控制水土流失，而且还可以植树和种植豆类作物；在荒山上封山育林，植树造林，还培养了牧草，发展了畜牧业；在丘陵地区和坡地，整修了梯田，又利用田边、土埂广种苜蓿，发展养猪事业；水库可以养鱼，洼地可以改为稻田，沟内可以种植莲藕蒲苇之类。他们还利用水力修建了小型发电站。总之，当地有什么发展生产的条件就充分利用；如果还没有条件，就积极地创造条件加以利用。他们都注意了把水控制起来，变水患为水利。某些地区汛期把水送走，只排不蓄，旱时又向国家要水，这种做法，就是对于水缺乏综合利用的思想的反映。
    在开展群众性的兴修水利运动中，正确解决各级干部和群众的一些思想认识问题是很重要的。如：以小型工程为主，还是以大型工程为主？依靠国家投资，还是依靠广大群众的力量？全面规划、综合治理、集中治理，还是头痛医头、脚痛医脚，零零星星地去分散治理？全面开发、综合利用，把水利建设和当前生产结合起来，还是只顾兴修水利不顾当前生产，只顾山上不顾山下，只顾上游不顾下游，只顾排洪除涝不顾蓄水用水？这些都是有关水利建设的带根本性的思想问题，必须明确地加以解决，才能使兴修水利运动顺利开展。解决这些问题的最好的方法，就是认真总结当地的先进经验，组织参观展开辩论。无论是成功的经验或者是失败的教训，各地都有，应当总结起来，用以教育干部和群众。中共中央和国务院“关于今冬明春大规模地开展兴修农田水利和积肥运动的决定”的第一条就指出：“必须全面总结过去几年来，特别是1955年冬季和1956年春季水利建设高潮时期的经验教训。”目前许多省、区已经注意到这一点，这是好的。这里要指出的是，不要停留于只总结一些技术性的经验，重要的是从群众的创造性的活动中找出运动的规律来。只有这样，才能提高干部和群众的思想，明确方向，坚定信心，进一步发挥他们的积极性和创造性。当然，群众所创造的技术性的经验，也是丰富多采的，应当发动水利工程技术人员去进行科学的总结，以便加以提高和推广。
    兴修水利是保证农业增产的一个关键性措施，是一个广泛的群众运动。因此，必须书记动手，全党动员，发动群众。漭河流域和天津专区等地的经验说明，兴修水利这项任务，不是只有少数热心家就能够担负起来的；必须依靠全党，必须加强党的领导。在群众性的兴修水利的运动中，不仅有许多技术性的问题，而且有许多政策性的问题需要解决；有许多工作需要有关部门大力配合和支援；在干部和群众中需要进行广泛深入的思想教育工作。有的同志感觉到当前任务繁重，认为强调书记动手是不现实的。是的，当前的任务确实是繁重的，农村正在进行大辩论，不少地区粮、棉征购任务尚未完成，小麦的田间管理工作尚须加强，县以下的机关整风运动即将开始，农业生产合作社需要进一步整顿和巩固，省以下各级的农业发展规划都要赶快着手制定。这些工作都是必须做好的。但是，也必须了解，兴修水利对农业生产的发展，特别是对争取明年麦季的丰收是极为重要的，因而也是必须做好的。这就更加需要依靠各级党委把工作加以适当安排，科学地组织力量，有计划地把各项工作结合进行。天津专区和漭河流域的各级党委，几年来都是亲自抓着兴修水利的工作，使生产发展了，党和群众的关系更加密切了。这样做，不仅没有妨碍其它工作，反而给做好其它工作提供了有利条件。
    从全国各地的情况看来，今年冬季大兴水利的高潮，比1955年冬季提早了三个月。这是在我国农村开展社会主义教育运动的高潮之后随之而来的生产高潮的一个最重要的部分。这次高潮和第一次水利建设高潮相比，具有更加有利的条件。第一次水利建设高潮是在我国农业合作化刚刚基本上完成而又缺乏兴修水利的经验的情况下兴起的。现在我国农业合作化已经两年，合作社已进一步巩固，合作社可以用之于基本建设的公共积累已有增加，各地的领导机关和群众也都取得了一些兴修水利和组织劳动的经验，经过两条道路的大辩论，农民群众的社会主义觉悟已大为提高。所有这些，总括起来，就是：时间早，经验多，觉悟高，力量大，工作踏实。可以预期，只要我们加强领导，把各项有利条件充分运用起来，这一次兴修水利的高潮中，一定会比过去取得更大的胜利。
