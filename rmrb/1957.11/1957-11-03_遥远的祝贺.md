    Distant Congratulations
    Han Opera Actress Chen Bohua
    In 1954, I had the opportunity to visit and study in the Soviet Union as a member of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association delegation. I met many friends in the Soviet theater world. Their friendship and warmth left an indelible impression on my memory.
    At the Baku Akhundov State Theater, I saw the opera "Sevil". When we went to the lounge after watching the first act, we met a woman in her thirties with a pair of very beautiful and moving eyes. From the emotion that her eyes conveyed, I felt excited and thrilled. I didn't even need a translator to understand what she was "saying" to me, and I could tell that she was a very talented actress. When the translator came over, she asked me first, "Are you an actress?" She had also understood me from my eyes. She also asked, "Do you sing? Do you sing soprano or mezzo-soprano?" It was then that I understood that she was Abisheva, the Stalin Prize winner.
    We "hit it off" immediately. She graciously accompanied me to watch the rest of the performance that evening, explaining the plot to me constantly. She also told me that she would go to the theater to observe and learn whenever she didn't have a performance. She said, "An actor must live in the theater and be concerned about every play being staged." When she heard that we had more than a hundred different kinds of operas in China, she was amazed and envious. That was just the number at the time. If I told her now, "Under the leadership of the Party, we have discovered even more types of operas, not just over a hundred, but over three hundred!" I don't know how happy she would be!
    The time we spent together passed so quickly. Before saying goodbye, I asked her to sign her name for me. She wrote excitedly:
      “Dear comrade, our meeting is extraordinary.
  Please accept my extraordinary love!
  Say hello to Chairman Mao, hello to the great Chinese people!”
    When I heard the translator read her poetic words, I couldn't help but feel a lump in my throat. She also hugged me tightly, with tears falling on my shoulder. I pinned a commemorative badge with a profile of Chairman Mao on her chest. She comforted me, saying, "Although we are separated, our hearts are together. I can see your achievements in construction and artistic gains in newspapers and magazines. You will also gain many Soviet friends."
  Comrade Abisheva was right. I did meet more Soviet friends, who treated us with as much warmth and affection as if we were their own flesh and blood. In October of that year, Comrade Denisov and his party, who had hosted us in Moscow, also came to China to attend our National Day celebrations and even visited Wuhan. I can't describe how happy and excited I was when I welcomed these friends from afar. We stood on the ruins of the ancient Yellow Crane Tower and looked out over the Yangtze River. I pointed to the drilling ships on the river and said, "We are going to build a huge bridge across the Yangtze River from here. This Yellow Crane Tower will be the bridgehead of the future. Thanks to the Soviet experts, who are helping us realize this decades-long dream!" At that time, we estimated that it would take about four or five years for the Yangtze River Bridge to be completed. But the reality exceeded our expectations. From the day construction officially began, this bridge spanning the north and south of the Yangtze River was completed in just over two years. Without the selfless assistance of Soviet friends, who creatively applied their first-class design—the caisson drilling method—to this great project, such a miracle would not have been possible. No wonder many people call this magnificent bridge the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Bridge."
    I think Abisheva and Denisov must have read this happy news in the newspapers as well. What is particularly gratifying is that the official opening of the Yangtze River Bridge was on October 15, 1957, which was the tenth day after the "Red Moon," symbolizing a new era of human science, soared into the sky, and also on the eve of the fortieth anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution. Three happy events came one after another, how could we not be especially happy!
    In April of this year, when the Han Opera Troupe was performing in Shanghai, Soviet meritorious actress Ye. Kang. Liepkkovskaia, who was conducting a performing arts training class at the Shanghai Theatre Academy, became a frequent audience member of our Han Opera Troupe. I am grateful to her—this kind and sincere senior, like a mother—for giving us a lot of valuable lessons, and even more grateful that she loves our country so much, and loves the achievements of New China.
    When we visited her and asked her to criticize our performance, she enthusiastically introduced two new lines of poetry she had just written:
        China, my second motherland,
        You are as beautiful as the morning glow,
        You are as beautiful as the morning glow!
    Ye. Kang. Liepkkovskaia has returned to the Soviet Union after leaving behind her carefully staged "Rupture" and "Much Ado About Nothing", but her little poem has been lingering in my mind. Yes, our beloved motherland is indeed as beautiful as the "morning glow"!

### 遥远的祝贺

    遥远的祝贺
    汉剧演员　陈伯华
    1954年我曾经以中苏友好协会访苏代表团团员的身份，到苏联去作了一次访问和学习，认识了很多苏联戏剧界的朋友，她们的友爱和热情，在我记忆当中留下了永难磨灭的印象。
    在巴库阿红多夫国立剧院，我看到歌剧“谢菲尔”。当我们看完第一幕到休息室去，在那里遇见一位三十多岁的女性，她有一对非常美丽动人的眼睛，从她那能够用眼睛传达感情的眼神里，使我感觉到激动和兴奋，我已经不用翻译而了解她对我在“说”些什么了，同时还能断定她是一位非常有才能的演员。当翻译同志走来以后，她先开口问我了：“你是演员吗？”她也从眼睛里了解了我。她还问：“你是唱歌的吧，唱高音还是唱中音？”这时我才弄清楚，她就是斯大林奖金获得者阿比谢娃。
    我们是“一见如故”了，那晚的一场戏，是她亲切的陪着我在一起看完的，她还不断地为我讲解剧情，并且对我说，她没有演出任务的时候，就要到剧场观摩学习。她说：“做一个演员就要生活在戏剧当中，要关心每个戏的上演。”她听说我们中国有一百多个剧种时，感到惊奇和羡慕，其实那还是当时的统计，要是现在我告诉她：“我们在党的领导之下，已经发掘出更多的剧种，不是一百多种而是三百多种！”不知道她会高兴成什么样子呢！
    相聚的时间过得那么快，告别前我让她给我签个名，她激动地写道：
      “亲爱的同志，我们见面是不平
  凡的，请你接受我这不平凡的热爱
  吧！问候毛主席，问候伟大的中国人
  民！”
    我听了翻译同志念出她诗一般的语言时，我的眼眶子忽然禁不住发热了，她也把我紧紧地拥抱着，眼泪滴在我的肩头，我在她胸前别上一枚雕塑着毛主席侧像的纪念章，她安慰着我说：“我们人虽然分开了，心还在一起，我可以从报纸杂志上看到你们建设的成就和艺术的收获，你们还会得到很多苏联友人的。”
  阿比谢娃同志的话说对了，我的确遇见了更多的苏联友人，都像她那样满怀热情亲骨肉一样的看待着我们。就在那年10月间，曾经在莫斯科做过我们主人的杰尼索夫同志等一行，也来到中国参加了我国的国庆观礼，还到过武汉。当我迎接到这些远道而来的友人们，心情的愉快和兴奋也是无法形容的。我们站在古黄鹤楼的遗址上瞻望长江，我指着江上的钻探船说：“我们要从这里修建一座工程巨大的桥梁横跨长江，这个黄鹤楼就是未来的桥头堡。感谢苏联的专家们，正在帮助我们实现这个几十年的愿望呢！”当时我们的估计，大概需要四、五年以后，这座长江大桥才可以落成吧？事实又出乎意料之外，从正式兴工那天起，这一座飞架南北的长江大桥，只花了两年多一点的时间就宣告建成了，要不是苏联友人无私的帮助，把他们第一流的设计——管柱钻孔法，创造性的运用在这个伟大的工程之上，是不可能出现这样的奇迹的。难怪很多人都把这座巍峨壮丽的大桥叫做“中苏友谊桥”哩。
    我想，阿比谢娃和杰尼索夫同志，也一定在报纸上知道这条令人高兴的消息了。特别使人高兴的是长江大桥正式通车是1957年的10月15日，这正是标志着人类科学新纪元的“红色的月亮”飞向天空的第十天；也是伟大的十月社会主义革命四十周年的前夕，三重喜事接踵而来，怎么不该特别高兴呢！
    今年4月间，汉剧团在上海演出时，苏联的功勋演员叶·康·列普柯芙斯卡娅正好在上海戏剧学院主持表演师资进修班，也成了我们汉剧团经常的观众，我感激她——这位像妈妈一样慈祥、诚恳的前辈，给了我们很多宝贵的教益，更感激她是那样的热爱我们的国家，热爱新中国的成就。
    在我们去拜访她，请她对我们的表演提出批评时，她热诚地介绍她刚写的两句新诗：
        中国，我的第二个祖国，
        你像朝霞一样的美丽，
        你像朝霞一样的美丽！
    叶·康·列普柯芙斯卡娅留下她精心排演的“决裂”和“无事生非”以后，已经回苏联去了，可是，她写的小诗，却一直萦回在我的脑海中，是啊，可爱的祖国，真是像“朝霞”那样美丽啊！
