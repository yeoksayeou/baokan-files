Xinhua News Agency, 18th – A correspondence shooting competition between China and the German Democratic Republic will be held in Beijing and Berlin between November 20th and 22nd.

The competition events include men's and women's small-bore rifle shooting in three positions (standing, kneeling, and prone) with 120 shots; and four men's pistol events including rapid fire at silhouette targets and slow fire. Each country will select five athletes per event to form a team to participate in the competition. In addition to sending four teams to participate in the team correspondence competition, some Chinese athletes will also participate in the individual championship competitions for these four events.

The Chinese shooters participating in the correspondence competition include internationally renowned athletes such as Zhang Hong, Lu Guizhen (female), Liu Jiaqiu, and Cao Jingfen (female), who won individual championships, runners-up, and third place in the international shooting competition held in Romania this September.

This competition was proposed by the German Democratic Republic to enhance the friendship between the people of China and Germany and strengthen the connection between athletes. During the competition, the embassies of the two countries in each other's countries will send personnel to participate in the work of the referee committees in their respective countries. The results of the competition and the shooting targets will also be exchanged with each other, and the host country will finally evaluate the results and rankings and notify the other party by correspondence. This is an economical and simple form of international competition.

    一种既节约又简便的国际比赛形式
    中德通讯射击比赛将在北京柏林同时举行
    新华社18日讯　中国和德意志民主共和国之间的通讯射击比赛，将在11月20日到22日间分别在北京和柏林举行。
    比赛项目有男子和女子小口径步枪立、跪、卧三种姿式一百二十发射击，男子手枪人像靶速射和慢射等四项，两国每项各选五名运动员组成一队参加比赛。中国除派四个队参加队际的通讯比赛外，还有一部分运动员参加两国的这四个项目的个人冠军赛。
    参加通讯比赛的中国射手有国际知名的张鋐、陆桂珍（女）、刘佳秋和曹靖芬（女）等，他们今年9月在罗马尼亚举行的国际射击比赛中曾获得了个人冠军、亚军和第三名。
    这次比赛是德意志民主共和国提议举行的，目的是为了增进中德两国人民的友谊和加强运动员之间的联系。比赛时，两国驻对方国家的大使馆将派人参加所在国的裁判委员会工作。比赛的结果和射击后的靶纸也要相互交换，最后由主办国家评定成绩和名次，用通讯方式通知对方。这是一种既节约又简便的国际比赛形式。
