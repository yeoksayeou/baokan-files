    Historical Science Workers Must Focus on Ideological Remolding
    --Refuting Rightist Xiang Da's Anti-Party and Anti-Socialist Remarks--
    Chen Yuan, Director of the Second Institute of History, Chinese Academy of Sciences

    I would like to offer a few opinions specifically regarding Mr. Xiang Da's anti-Party and anti-socialist remarks.

    I have not had much contact with Mr. Xiang, but I had never heard him say anything critical of the Party before. Only in recent months, after everyone exposed him, did I realize the extent of his anti-Party sentiments. Upon hearing this, I was both surprised and very angry. His words and actions are truly unexpected.

    In my opinion, the fundamental reason for his anti-Party and anti-socialist remarks lies in his class stance. Viewing new people and new things from a bourgeois standpoint will inevitably lead to ideological conflicts and emotional dissonance. Treating the working class party with bourgeois thoughts and feelings will naturally result in hostility, and one will find fault with everything a Communist Party member does. Mr. Xiang once said, "Science cannot be conducted with a 'those who obey me prosper, those who defy me perish' attitude." In reality, he has opinions about every Party member he works with, viciously cursing, sarcastically mocking, and wishing to scold every Party member he comes into contact with. Such a domineering attitude is truly a "those who obey me prosper, those who defy me perish" attitude.

    Why does Mr. Xiang hate the Party to such an extent? It turns out, as he himself said, that he did not undergo ideological remolding after liberation. His old thinking remained intact. While others have been progressing for the past eight years, he has been standing still.

    According to published materials, his arrogance and conceit have reached the point of mania. He looks down on everyone, believing himself to be knowledgeable and a scholar, considering himself an expert and something special. He often says that intellectuals are not street vagrants, who can be summoned at will and dismissed at whim. He often says that he can pack his bags and leave, and he will still have a way to eat even if he leaves the Academy of Sciences. He says he will stay if he agrees, and leave if he doesn't. He throws tantrums at the Party and acts like a senior, as if no place can function without Xiang Da. May I ask, if you leave the Academy of Sciences, will you still do your work at Peking University? Will you still do your work at the library? You can leave, but where will you go? Could it really be "to Taiwan"? Such thoughts and attitudes are not only a manifestation of bourgeois individual arrogance, but also deeply rooted in the bad habits of feudal scholar-officials.

    Mencius, the Confucian scholar, often put on airs with the monarchs of his time to show his high worth. One day, he was about to go to see the King of Qi, but when the King of Qi sent someone to invite him, he pretended to be sick and did not go. Mencius's style of putting on airs has had a profound influence. Intellectuals in feudal societies of all dynasties often put on airs. However, the nature of the state was different then from now. The state was ruled by one family, so intellectuals naturally felt that the state belonged to the monarch, that it was someone else's, and that they were guests or foreign ministers. They often thought that if you employed them, the country could be governed, and if you did not, the country could not be governed. This was not necessarily all bad at the time.

    But today, in the new society, the people are their own masters. Some intellectuals still put on a pretentious attitude. They do not get involved in the people's own world and still feel like guests. Mr. Xiang is like this. The Party and the government clearly respect and trust you, and ask you to take on important positions, but you insist on having a "five-day capital official" mentality. In the early days of liberation, not recognizing this was understandable. But after eight years of liberation, you still regard yourself as an outsider, thinking that this is speaking frankly and daring to advise, that this is being stubborn, and adopting various uncooperative attitudes. May I ask, who are you doing this to? Are you using this attitude to deal with the people? Being stubborn under reactionary rule can be considered heroic, but being stubborn in the cause of revolution is not an enemy?

    In the old society, not to mention that many intellectuals were displaced and suffered hardship, even Mr. Xiang himself was just an ordinary professor, and he was able to get along. After liberation, the government respected you so much and gave you a very high position, but you maliciously attacked and insulted, and nitpicked. Isn't this because your class stance has not changed at all? During the rule of the Kuomintang and Chiang Kai-shek, you were able to accept it calmly, but when the Communist Party led the people to take power, you found everything wrong. If this isn't anti-Party and anti-people, if this isn't dissatisfaction with the new social system, then how else can it be explained?

    I heard that Mr. Xiang once said that when mentioning the old historical circles, people only mention the two Chens, implying why he, Xiang Da, wasn't mentioned. I was very surprised to hear this. I don't know where the saying of the two Chens came from, but that's not the point. I feel that eight years after the national liberation, if there is still a distinction between new and old in the historical circles, it is because we have not worked hard enough. This is not something to be proud of, but something to be ashamed of. I regret that I learned the truth too late, that my accumulated habits are too deep, that my old ways have not been washed away, and that it is not easy to accept the new. As the saying goes, "Learning after the time has passed is laborious and difficult to achieve." We cannot allow the distinction between new and old to exist in the historical circles for a long time, because after ideological remolding, an old historian accepts a new worldview and uses Marxist ideology to guide academic research, he gradually becomes a new historian. Every old historian should actively study Marxism and transform himself into a new historian as soon as possible. Mr. Xiang seems afraid that people will not call him an old historian, as if he hopes to keep the title of old historian forever and even takes pride in it.

    Mr. Xiang also often mentions that I am over seventy years old, and so on. Yes, I am an old man of seventy-eight this year. However, I have never given up learning because I am old. Although I started learning Marxism very late, and although I have great difficulties in learning because of my age and failing senses, once I understood, I was determined to follow the Communist Party and do my best to carry out ideological remolding and study political theory. In the past eight years, although I can't say I have achieved anything, my belief is very firm and has never wavered in the slightest, precisely because I have found the most correct and glorious path that I have dreamed of for many years. Because what I believe in is science, and what I support is truth. Therefore, I am not willing to be the banner of the old historical circles, I am willing to be an old soldier in the Marxist historical science ranks, I am not willing to be a master in the old historical circles, I am willing to be a primary school student in the new historical circles. Here I want to tell Mr. Xiang frankly, you said you have a ruler and often use it to measure people, I advise you to go back and break this outdated ruler! Today is the new era of the people's century, the standards for measuring people have long changed, and it is no longer accurate to use the old ruler.

    Before liberation, a large part of us intellectuals did not have the opportunity to come into contact with Marxism. After liberation, the vast majority of intellectuals studied Marxism and broadened their horizons. Especially those of us who study history, many of us used to grasp some scattered materials, and even if we grasped relatively rich materials, we had great limitations in research without the correct stance, viewpoint, and method. But after studying and recognizing the inevitable laws of historical development, we can more clearly understand the past of mankind, see the present, and look forward to the future. I feel that people who study history, after ideological remolding, should be able to understand the path of human development more easily, and therefore should be more satisfied with the new society, and should be more receptive to the leadership of the Party, the policies of the government, and all new measures, and should support them more enthusiastically. I never expected that Mr. Xiang would refuse ideological remolding, infinitely nostalgic for the old society, not only not accustomed to the new society, but also increasingly hostile to it.

    The Party has always been very concerned about and respectful of intellectuals. The two written speeches by Vice-President Tang Yongtong are good examples, and I myself have the same feeling, and my situation is similar to that of Vice-President Tang. In the past few years, the respect and trust of the Party and the government for intellectuals, and their meticulous care for us, have moved many people greatly, so that the vast majority of intellectuals are more consciously serving the people wholeheartedly, which is of course very good. I think that even if some individuals feel that they are not taken care of enough and feel unhappy, when they see hundreds of millions of people being liberated and seeing the oppressed people breaking open the shackles that have bound them for thousands of years and achieving true liberation, they should also feel that this is the most exciting thing and put aside personal gains and losses. Especially those of us who study history, seeing the working people who create history truly become the masters of the country, isn't this something that should be extremely happy about? Compared with personal gains and losses, how can the importance be compared? Moreover, Mr. Xiang has only personal gains after liberation, what losses have there been? As he himself said about others, after liberation he has truly been "promoted three levels in a row," what else is there to be dissatisfied with? If you want to say that there is something lost, I think it is the class you originally depended on! Do you feel that "if the skin is gone, what will the hair attach to"? Do you feel that you have become a "gentleman on the beam" hanging in mid-air? Is this why you feel "depressed" and "dying"?

    Mr. Xiang, like other rightists, is clamoring wildly that laymen cannot lead experts, saying that this one should step down and that one should step down, that Party members are either violating laws and disciplines, disregarding kinship, or acting recklessly and swindling, as if there isn't a single good person among Party members. Comrade Qian Junrui was originally the Vice-Minister of Education and was transferred to the Vice-Minister of Culture, and he said it was "promoted three levels in a row." It's hard to understand why the Ministry of Education is three levels lower than the Ministry of Culture? Isn't this nitpicking? Talking about Xie Xinhe, the Deputy Secretary-General of the Academy of Sciences, he said that because Deputy Secretary-General Xie once attended a meeting and asked Xiang Da, "What is your name? What unit do you represent?" So Xiang Da thought, "I have never seen Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou have this attitude," meaning that Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou both know me, but you are just a Deputy Secretary-General of the Academy of Sciences and you don't even know me, Xiang Da, how can you lead academics? I really don't know what kind of logic this is! The reason why he says this is actually to let all Party members step down, that is, to oppose the Party by opposing individual Party members, to oppose the leadership of the Party, the problem is very obvious.

    Mr. Xiang said that it is not possible to do a good job in social sciences by relying only on 12 million Party members, but you want this one to step down and that one to step down, and when they have all stepped down, only you, Xiang Da, is left, can you do a good job in social sciences? Isn't this just saying that the Party cannot lead academics, cannot lead science, and attempting to let the Party step down and let bourgeois social science come to power? If the leadership is handed over to bourgeois intellectuals, the socialist revolution cannot be carried out! Don't fantasize that a Hungarian incident might happen in China. Not only will the broad masses of workers and peasants not agree, but the enlightened intellectuals will also resolutely not agree.

    Mr. Xiang should recognize that intellectuals' thinking must be transformed. You cannot have a negative reaction at the mention of transformation and feel pressured. Studying Marxism is not "lowering one's status." In fact, it is the most glorious thing for a person to surrender to the truth. Let's think about it carefully. For more than 30 years, the Chinese people have walked a difficult, glorious, and great road under the leadership of the Communist Party. Advanced people and advanced intellectuals have long been engaged in a vigorous revolutionary cause. But some of us have been confined to a corner. In the past, we did not have the opportunity to participate in the revolution in person, so we can only make redoubled efforts today to contribute our meager strength. In the face of the earth-shaking revolutionary cause, in the face of the soldiers who do not hesitate to shed blood and sacrifice, even if we have written a few papers, how much contribution is that? Now the world's first artificial satellite has been launched by Soviet scientists and is orbiting the earth. The era in which humans are limited to living on the earth is coming to an end, and the era in which humans enter the universe is beginning. Such great achievements are worthy of pride. Even if an individual has done a little bit of work, what is there to be proud of? I think that some intellectuals often overemphasize their own role, often thinking highly of themselves, being arrogant and conceited, looking down on the masses, looking down on workers and peasants, as if the socialist society cannot be built without them. And at critical moments in history, they cannot stand the test and reveal their true colors. This is because they have not seriously transformed their thinking in the past.

    I see that Mr. Xiang's problem is quite serious, and has developed from individualism to political ambition. Not to mention the anti-Party activities carried out in collusion with other rightists on the issue of the Tujia ethnic group, even his words and deeds in other aspects have already developed to a serious point.

    I have read Mr. Xiang's two self-criticism records. The self-criticism only listed some facts, without touching on the ideology, only analyzing his own problems from the surface, and failing to dig into the essence of the ideology. If this continues, I am afraid that he will not recognize the serious errors in his position and behavior for a while.

    Mr. Xiang himself should consider that for the past eight years, the people have never treated you as an outsider, but you have always alienated yourself from the people. You have placed yourself in the ranks of the people, but you have stood on the anti-socialist position and taken actions that are detrimental to the socialist cause. This time, you should bring out your true ideological activities, analyze why you stand on the anti-Party and anti-people position, analyze why you feel dissatisfied with the new society everywhere, take out those bad things and discard them, so that you can make progress.

    Mr. Xiang should know that his mistakes are very serious, but it is not to say that there is no way out. Rightists still have a future. A rightist is not necessarily a rightist forever. His own nature can change. Premier Zhou said that the door of socialist transformation is open to rightists. I think the important thing is to see if you are willing to come in.

    Now we must draw a clear line between ourselves and Mr. Xiang politically and ideologically, but we still hope that Mr. Xiang can patiently and carefully consider his own problems, and can humbly and sincerely accept socialist transformation, "realizing that he has not strayed far, realizing that today is right and yesterday was wrong," turning back as soon as possible, and not being so "stubborn" and not truly cutting yourself off from the people. We hope that you will return to the ranks of the people and the ranks of historical science soon!

    历史科学工作者必须着重进行思想改造
    ——驳斥右派分子向达反党反社会主义言行——
    中国科学院历史研究所第二所所长　陈垣
    我想专就有关向达先生的反党反社会主义的言行谈几点意见。
    我和向先生接触不多，但以前并没听见过他有对党不满的话。最近几个月以来，经大家揭发，才知道他有这样大的反党情绪。听到后，一方面感到惊讶，一方面非常气愤。他这些言行，真是出人意外。
    他所以有这样的反党反社会主义的言行，据我看来，根本原因是阶级立场的关系。站在资产阶级立场来看新人新事，在思想上一定会有抵触，在感情上一定会格格不入。拿资产阶级的思想感情来对待工人阶级的政党，自然就会有敌对情绪，看到共产党员所做所为自然就处处都不满意了。向先生曾说：“办科学不能‘顺我者生，逆我者亡’”，实际上他对任何同他有工作关系的党员都有意见，恶毒的咒骂，冷嘲热讽，恨不得骂尽和他接触的所有的党员，这样蛮横的态度，倒真是“顺我者生，逆我者亡”的态度了。
    向先生为什么会仇视党到这种地步呢？原来正像他自己所说的，他解放以后，并没有进行思想改造，旧思想还是原封不动，八年来，人家都在进步，他却在原地踏步。
    根据刊布的材料，他的骄傲自大，已经达到狂妄的地步了。他目中无人，自以为有学问，有知识，自以为是专家，了不起。常说知识分子不是街头流浪者，不能呼之则来，挥之则去。常说我可以卷铺盖走，离开科学院也有地方吃饭。说什么合则留不合则去。和党发脾气，摆老资格，真好像哪个地方离开了向达就不能办事一样。试问你离开科学院，那末北大的工作你还作不作呢？图书馆的工作你还作不作呢？可以走，走到哪里去呢？难道真的是
  “到台湾去”吗？这样的思想、态度，不仅是资产阶级个人狂妄自大的表现，而且是有极深的封建的士大夫的处世恶习。
    儒家的孟子对于当时的君主就常常端着架子，以表示自己的身价高。有一天，他本来将要去朝见齐王，恰好这时齐王着人来请他，他反而装病不去了。孟子这种摆架子的作风，一直影响很深，封建社会各朝各代的知识分子，每每摆起架子。但是那时的国家性质和现在不同，国家由一姓一家统治，知识分子也就自然会觉得国家是君主的，是人家的，他自己是作客的，是客卿。他们常以为你用我，国就可治，不用我，国就不可治。在当时也不一定都是不好。
    但是今天在新社会，人民自己当家作主，有的知识分子仍端着臭架子，人民自己的天下，自己不插手，仍觉得是客卿。向先生就是这样，党和政府明明对你尊敬和信任，请你担任着重要职务，而你自己却偏偏有“五日京兆”之心。在初解放，不认识，还情有可原。解放已经八年，还把自己作为外人，却以为这是直言敢谏，以为这是倔强，采取种种不合作的态度，试问你这是对谁呢？是拿这态度来对付人民吗？在反动统治的时候倔强，那算是好汉，对革命事业上倔强，这还不是敌人吗？
    在旧社会的时候，且不说很多知识分子颠沛流离，艰难困苦，就是向先生自己也不过是作一个普通教授，而那时却也相安无事。解放后，政府这样尊重你，给予你很高的地位，你反而恶意攻击辱骂，吹毛求疵，这不是阶级立场根本没有改变，还是什么呢？在国民党蒋介石统治的时期，你倒也安之若素，在共产党领导人民坐天下的时候，你就看着这也不对那也不对，这不是反党反人民，这不是不满意新的社会制度，又怎样来解释呢？
    我听说，向先生曾说过现在举旧史学界，都只举二陈，言外大有为什么不举我向达的意思。我听了很惊异。二陈之说，不知从何而起，这且不谈。我觉得在全国解放八年的今天，如果史学界仍存在新旧之分，这是我们大家的努力不够，这不是什么光荣，这是惭愧。我正痛恨我自己闻道太晚，积习较深，旧染未洗除，知新不容易进去，真所谓“时过而后学，则勤苦而难成”。我们不能让史学界长期存在新旧之分，因为旧史学家经过思想改造，接受了新的世界观，以马克思主义思想来指导学术的研究，他就逐渐成为新史学家了。每一个旧史学家，都应当积极学习马克思主义，使自己尽快的改造成为新史学家。不想向先生很怕人不称他为旧史学家，似乎希望永远保持旧史学家的头衔，而反引以为荣一样。
    向先生又常常谈到我是七十多岁的高龄如何如何，不错，我今年已是七十八岁的老人。但是，我从没因为老就放弃学习。尽管我学习马克思主义很晚，尽管我因为年龄的限制，耳目已不聪明，学习上有很大的困难，但是自从我有了认识，就下定决心跟着共产党走，尽我最大的努力来进行思想改造，学习政治理论。八年以来，我虽谈不上有什么成绩，但是我的信念甚坚，从来没有丝毫动摇，就是因为我找到了多年来梦寐以求的最正确的最光荣的道路。因为我相信的是科学，我拥护的是真理。因此，我不愿作旧史学界的旗帜，我愿作马克思主义历史科学队伍中的老兵，我不愿作旧史学界的大师，我甘心作新史学界的小学生。这里我要正告向先生，你说你有一把尺，常拿这尺来衡量人，我奉劝你回去把这过了时的尺摔断了吧！今天已经是人民世纪的新纪元，衡量人的度量衡早已改变了，再拿出旧尺来，已经量不准确尺寸了。
    解放以前，我们知识分子，有很大一部分人是没有机会接触马克思主义的。解放以后，绝大多数的知识分子，学习了马克思主义，眼界为之开阔。尤其是我们学历史的，很多人以往都是掌握了一些零零散散的材料，纵然是掌握了比较丰富的材料，但是没有正确的立场、观点、方法，在研究上有很大的限制。而经过学习，认清了历史发展必然的规律，才更清楚的了解到人类的过去，看到现在，向往未来。我觉得学历史的人，经过思想改造，应该比别人更容易理解人类的发展途径，因此对新社会就应该更加满意，对党的领导，对政府的政策，以及一切新的措施，应该更容易接受，应该更热烈的拥护。想不到向先生竟拒绝思想改造，对旧社会无限的留恋，对新社会不但不习惯，而且反越来越仇视。
    党对知识分子，从来就是非常关心和尊重的，汤用彤副校长的两次书面发言，就是很好的例证，我自己也有同样的感觉，也和汤副校长的情况差不多。几年来，党和政府对于知识分子的尊重和信任，对于我们无微不至的关怀，已经使很多人十分感动，从而绝大多数的知识分子就更加自觉的一心一意的为人民服务，这当然是很好的。我想，纵然有个别的人感到对自己照顾不够，心里有些不快，但是当他们看到亿万人民得到翻身，看到受压迫的人打开了几千年来束缚着的枷锁，得到真正解放的时候，也应当感到是最令人振奋的事情而把个人得失抛开。尤其是我们研究历史的人，看到创造历史的劳动人民真正作了国家的主人，难道这还不是应该极端高兴的事情吗？这和个人的得失相较，轻重又怎能相比呢？何况向先生解放后只有个人的所得，何尝有什么所失呢？正像他自己所说别人的话，解放以后真是“连升三级”了，还有哪些不满呢？如果要是说有所失的话，我想就是失去你原来所依附的阶级了！你是不是感到“皮之不存，毛将焉附”了呢？你是不是感到自己作了悬在半空的“梁上君子”了呢？是不是因此而感到“意气消沉”“奄奄一息”了呢？
    向先生也和其他右派分子一样，在狂妄的叫嚣外行不能领导内行，说这个也应该下台，那个也应该下台，党员不是违法乱纪，六亲不认，就是胡作非为，招摇撞骗，好像党员就没有一个好人一样。钱俊瑞同志原是教育部副部长，调为文化部副部长，他说是“连升三级”。让人很难理解，教育部为什么比文化部低三级呢？这不是吹毛求疵是什么呢？谈到科学院谢鑫鹤副秘书长，则说因为谢副秘书长在一次参加会的时候，曾和向达说“你姓什么？代表那个单位？”于是向达就认为“我见毛主席、周总理他们都没有这种态度”，意思就是说毛主席、周总理都认识我，你不过是一个科学院的副秘书长，连我向达都不认识，这怎能领导学术？真不知这是什么逻辑！他所以这样说，实际上就是让党员都下台，就是要通过反对个别党员来反对党，反对党的领导，问题是很明显的。
    向先生说搞社会科学，仅靠一千二百万党员做不好，但是你让这个下台，那个下台，都下台了，只剩你向达一人，难道就能把社会科学搞好吗？这还不就是说党不能领导学术，不能领导科学，企图让党下台，使资产阶级社会科学上台吗？把领导权交给资产阶级知识分子，社会主义革命就无法进行了！你不要妄想中国可能发生匈牙利事件，这不但广大工农不答应，就是觉悟了的知识分子也是坚决不能答应的。
    向先生应当认清，知识分子思想必须改造，不能一提改造就有反感，就觉得有压力。学习马克思主义并不是“降低身份”，实际上一个人能向真理投降，是最光荣的事情。我们细想一下，三十多年来，中国人民在共产党的领导下，走过的是一条艰难困苦、光荣伟大的道路。先进的人们、先进的知识分子早已在作着轰轰烈烈的革命事业。而我们有些人却闭塞一隅，过去既没有机会亲自参加革命，只有今天加倍努力以尽自己微薄的力量。在翻天覆地的革命事业面前，在不惜流血牺牲的战士面前，纵然自己曾写过几篇论文，那又算得了有多大的贡献呢？现在世界上第一个人造卫星已经由苏联科学家发射出来，正在环绕地球转动，人类仅限于在地球上生活的时期正在结束，人类进入宇宙的时代正在开始。这样伟大的成就，才值得骄傲。个人纵然做过一点点工作，又有什么可骄傲的呢？我看有些知识分子，就是常常过分强调自己的作用，往往自命很高，骄傲自大，看不起群众，看不起工农，好像没有他就建不成社会主义社会一样。而在历史的重大关头就经不起考验了，就原形毕露了，这就是因为过去没有认真改造思想的原故。
    我看向先生的问题，性质是相当严重的，已由个人主义发展为政治野心家。且不说在土家族的问题上与其他右派分子勾结在一起进行的反党活动，就是在其他方面的言行，也已经发展到了严重的地步。
    我看了向先生的两次检讨记录，检讨里只罗列了一些事实，并没有触及到思想，只从表面分析自己的问题，未能挖到思想的实质，如果这样下去，恐怕一时还不会认识自己的立场和行为的严重错误。
    向先生自己应当考虑，八年来人民从没有外待你，你却一直自外于人民，你置身于人民队伍之中，却站在反对社会主义的立场上，并且采取不利于社会主义事业的行动。这一次应把真实的思想活动拿出来，分析出到底为什么站在反党反人民的立场，分析到底为什么对新的社会处处感到不满，把那些坏东西拿出来，丢掉它，这样自己才能有进步。
    向先生应该知道，自己的错误是十分严重的，但也并不是说就没有办法了。右派分子也还是有前途的，右派分子并不一定永远是右派分子，他的本身是可以发生变化的，周总理说，社会主义改造的大门，对右派分子是开着的。我看重要的是看你自己愿不愿进来了。
    现在我们要在政治上和思想上与向先生划清界限，但是我们还希望向先生能够耐心的仔细的考虑自己的问题，能够谦虚诚恳的接受社会主义改造，“实迷途其未远，觉今是而昨非”，及早回头，不要再那样“固执”，不要真的自绝于人民。盼望你早一天回到人民的队伍，回到历史科学的队伍来！（10月11日在科学院召开的批判史学界右派分子座谈会上的发言摘录）
