    Developing Mountainous Areas is a Major Task for the Entire Party and All the People
    The Rural Work Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China Convenes a Symposium on Mountainous Area Production to Determine Guiding Principles: Do a Good Job in Soil and Water Conservation, Strive for Self-Sufficiency in Grain and Oil Crops with a Surplus, and Develop Diversified Economic Activities
    The symposium on mountainous area production convened by the Rural Work Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China ended on the 19th. The symposium unanimously agreed that facing the mountainous areas, marching into the mountainous areas, and comprehensively developing mountainous area production is one of the important directions for developing agricultural production in our country.
    The symposium began on November 1st. Participants included secretaries of provincial Party committees, heads of rural work departments, and heads of relevant central ministries. Vice Chairman Zhu De gave important instructions on mountainous area work before the end of the meeting. Deng Zihui, Minister of the Rural Work Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, made a concluding report.
    The information gathered at the symposium showed that on the basis of the realization of agricultural cooperativization, in recent years, the production and various economic construction undertakings in mountainous areas have made considerable progress, and people's lives in terms of food, clothing, housing, and transportation have been significantly improved. However, due to insufficient attention in some areas, the resources of mountainous areas have not yet been extensively developed. Therefore, the lives of people in general mountainous areas are not as prosperous as those in the plains. In order to develop mountainous areas and do a good job in mountainous area work, the symposium, after full discussion, exchanged experiences, unified understanding, clarified directions, and formulated preliminary plans. The meeting believed that the comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and local specialties, mining, and other production in mountainous areas is of extreme importance to China's economic construction.
    First, mountainous areas are vast and rich in resources. Mountainous and semi-mountainous areas account for about 80% of the total area of ​​mainland China. Apart from ethnic minority areas such as Tibet, Xinjiang, and Qinghai, according to the statistics of the twenty-one provinces participating in the symposium, mountainous and semi-mountainous areas account for 62.4% of the area of ​​these provinces and cities; more than half of the counties in these provinces and cities are distributed in mountainous and semi-mountainous areas; in such vast mountainous areas, not only does the cultivated land area and grain output account for about one-third of the total cultivated land area and total grain output of these areas, but there are also large areas of forests and special economic forests such as tung oil trees, tea oil trees, tea trees, and various dry and fresh fruit trees; local specialties and various mineral resources awaiting utilization and development are also very rich. Therefore, this symposium believes that it would be a serious mistake to neglect the production and construction of the vast mountainous areas; if the production of the mountainous areas is fully developed, it will not only gradually meet the needs of the national economy for agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations and local specialties, but also further improve the living standards of the more than 200 million rural people in mountainous areas. Accordingly, the symposium unanimously recognized that the planned and full development and utilization of mountainous area resources, and the vigorous development of mountainous area production, is an important strategic direction for the development of industrial and agricultural production in our country.
    Secondly, from the perspective of the overall and long-term development of agricultural production, it is also necessary to pay attention to mountainous areas. Special attention should be paid to the greening work in mountainous areas in order to prevent soil erosion. Although great achievements have been made in controlling soil erosion in various places in recent years, soil erosion is still quite serious in the vast mountainous, semi-mountainous and Loess Plateau areas in the upper and middle reaches of the Yellow River, and in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, Huai River, Hai River, and Liao River water systems. Soil erosion in these areas not only seriously affects local agricultural production, but also poses a serious flood threat to the plains in the lower reaches of various rivers. Therefore, the symposium believes that it is extremely important for mountainous areas in various places to plant trees on all barren mountains and bare ridges suitable for greening, on the premise of comprehensively developing production; vigorously planting various trees in mountainous areas can not only increase farmers' income and prevent soil erosion, but also conserve water sources and regulate the climate after the forest area increases, and may fundamentally eliminate natural disasters such as droughts, floods, and hailstorms. Accordingly, the symposium pointed out that the comprehensive development of mountainous area production, including afforestation and greening mountainous areas, is a fundamental key to ensuring the development of agricultural production throughout the country.
    Thirdly, the production potential of mountainous areas is very large, and tapping the production potential of mountainous areas is an important link in pushing China's agricultural production greatly forward at present. The production potential of mountainous areas is reflected in two aspects. On the one hand, the existing production level is not high. At present, the yield per unit area of ​​grain crops in mountainous areas is generally low; the output of various special economic trees is also uneven. For example, in the case of tea oil trees, the yield per unit area is as high as 160 jin in some areas, but as low as 11 jin in other areas. If the grain yield in mountainous areas is slightly increased, and the yield of special economic trees with lower yields is increased to the existing higher level, a large amount of wealth will be added to the country in the next few years due to their large area. On the other hand, mountainous areas have a large area of ​​undeveloped land suitable for forestry and animal husbandry, and other resources are also very rich. Some special economic trees, such as tung oil trees, tussah silkworms, and tea oil trees, have been vigorously restored after liberation, but have not yet been restored to the highest level before the war. If the usable barren mountains are utilized in accordance with the requirements of comprehensive planning; those that have not been restored to the highest level before the war are quickly restored and developed, some production will have great development in a short period of time. Therefore, the symposium believes that it is also extremely important to vigorously develop mountainous area production in terms of providing the national economy with more agricultural, forestry, animal husbandry, and local specialty products at present.
    The symposium pointed out that many mountainous areas are old revolutionary base areas, and the people in the old areas have made great contributions to China's revolutionary cause. In recent years after liberation, with the support and leadership of the Party and the government, the production and lives of the people in the old areas have been improved to varying degrees, but the lives of the people in some old base areas with serious wounds are still relatively difficult. Therefore, the comprehensive development of mountainous area production not only has huge economic significance, but also has great political significance.
    The general goal of mountainous area construction unanimously agreed upon by the symposium is encouraging. This goal is: to build the now economically and culturally backward mountainous areas into socialist mountainous areas that are economically and culturally advanced, prosperous, healthy, and happy.
    In order to achieve this goal, the symposium discussed the guiding principles, tasks, and various measures that should be taken for mountainous area production and construction.
    The guiding principle for mountainous area production and construction is based on the characteristics, favorable conditions, and difficult factors of mountainous area production. This guiding principle is: on the basis of doing a good job in soil and water conservation and striving for self-sufficiency in grain, oil crops, etc. with a surplus, to develop agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and local specialties, minerals, and other diversified economic activities in a planned, locally appropriate, and comprehensive manner.
    The symposium believes that in order to comprehensively develop mountainous area production, it is necessary to obtain the close cooperation and support of various departments of the national economy. First of all, it is necessary to gradually change the inconvenient transportation conditions in mountainous areas, so as to transport products out of the mountainous areas and transport in the necessities for people's production and life in mountainous areas. In order to support mountainous area production, processing industry, handicraft industry, and various technical personnel must go to the mountains to obtain raw materials locally and process them locally into finished or semi-finished products, so as to adapt to the inconvenient transportation conditions and facilitate transportation out. Commercial work is extremely important in promoting mountainous area production. The symposium believes that a commercial network must be built in mountainous areas; agricultural cooperatives can be entrusted to purchase and sell on commission in mountainous areas with sparse population, so as to purchase various products from farmers in mountainous areas; the purchase prices of some products that are not reasonable enough should be adjusted to stimulate farmers' enthusiasm for production. The cultural, educational, and health undertakings in mountainous areas must also be gradually developed on the basis of increased production, so as to improve the cultural level of mountainous areas and eliminate various diseases of farmers in mountainous areas. In order to do a good job in the above aspects, the heads of relevant central ministries put forward preliminary plans to support mountainous areas at the meeting.
    The unified leadership of the Party is the fundamental guarantee for the comprehensive development of mountainous area production. The symposium believes that under the unified leadership of Party committees at all levels, comprehensive plans should be drawn up for the short-term and long-term development of mountainous area agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and the development of transportation, various small-scale industries that are conducive to mountainous area production, handicrafts, and cultural, educational, and health undertakings.
    The symposium emphatically pointed out that building mountainous areas mainly relies on the people in the mountainous areas. At present, cooperativization has been completed in mountainous areas. Therefore, it is necessary to run and consolidate cooperatives in mountainous areas well. In order to do a good job in mountainous area work, Party committees in various places must plan to mobilize a large number of outstanding cadres and urban and rural people to go to the mountains, and learn from the determination of the Gansu Provincial Party Committee to build mountainous areas with the determination to "live ten years less." In terms of the scale of the society and the organization of labor, cooperatives in mountainous areas should handle affairs in accordance with the characteristics of mountainous areas, and should not rigidly copy the experience of the plains. According to the characteristics of mountainous area production with a large commodity nature, the symposium believes that it is extremely important to constantly carry out socialist and collectivist education among cooperative members in mountainous areas.

    建设山区是全民全党的大事
    中共中央农村工作部召开山区生产座谈会确定方针  作好水土保持力争粮食油料自给有余发展多种经济
    新华社28日讯　中共中央农村工作部召开的山区生产座谈会在19日结束。座谈会一致认为：面向山区，向山区进军，全面发展山区生产是我国发展农业生产的重要方向之一。
    座谈会是从11月1日开始的。参加会议的有各省中共省委书记、农村工作部部长和中央有关各部负责人。朱德副主席在会议结束以前对山区工作作了重要指示。中共中央农村工作部部长邓子恢作了总结报告。
    座谈会汇集的情况表明：在实现了农业合作化的基础上，几年来山区的生产和各项经济建设事业有了不小的发展，人民在衣食住行等方面都得到了显著的改善。但是，由于有些地区不够重视，山区的富源还没有大量开发出来，因此，一般山区人民的生活同平原地区比较还是并不充裕的。为了开发山区，做好山区工作，座谈会经过充分讨论，交流了经验，统一了认识，明确了方向，制订了初步规划。会议认为，全面发展山区的农业、林业、牧业和土特产、采矿等生产对我国经济建设有着极重要的意义。
    首先，山区面积辽阔，资源丰富。在我国大陆全部面积中，山区、半山区约占80％左右。除西藏、新疆、青海等少数民族地区外，据参加座谈会的二十一个省统计，山区、半山区面积占这些省、市面积的62．4％；这些省、市有半数以上的县份分布在山区和半山区；在这样辽阔的山区中不仅耕地面积和粮食产量都占这些地区耕地总面积和粮食总产量的三分之一左右，而且还有面积很大的森林和油桐、油茶、茶叶以及各种干、鲜果树等特种经济林木；土特产和各种矿藏等有待利用和开发的资源也非常丰富。因此，这个座谈会认为，如果忽视广大山区的生产建设，就要犯严重的错误；如果把山区的生产全面地发展起来，不仅可以逐步满足国民经济对农业、林业、牧业、副业和土特产品的需要，而且还可以使山区两亿多农村人口的生活水平进一步提高。据此，座谈会一致认识到：有计划地充分地开发和利用山区资源，大力发展山区生产，是我国发展工农业生产的一个具有战略性的重要方向。
    其次，从农业生产的全局和长远发展着眼，也必须重视山区。特别应该重视山区的绿化工作，以便防止水土流失。几年来各地在控制水土流失方面虽然取得了很大成绩，但黄河上游、中游和长江、淮河、海河、辽河等水系上游的广大山区、半山区和黄土高原地区水土流失现象还相当严重。这些地区的水土流失，不仅严重地影响当地的农业生产，并使各河下游的平原地区受到严重的洪水威胁。因此，座谈会认为，各地山区在全面发展生产的前提下，把宜于绿化的一切光山秃岭都种上树木极为重要；山区大力植造各种林木，不仅可以增加农民收入和防止水土流失，而且森林面积增多之后还可以涵养水源，调节气候，有可能从根本上消除水旱风雹等自然灾害。据此，座谈会指出，包括植树造林、绿化山区在内的全面发展山区的生产，是保证全国农业生产发展的一个根本关键。
    再次，山区生产潜力很大，发挥山区生产潜力是当前把我国的农业生产向前大大推进一步的重要环节。山区生产潜力表现在两个方面。一方面是现有的生产水平不高。现在，山区粮食作物单位面积产量一般较低；各种特种经济林木的出产也不平衡。例如油茶，有的地区单位面积产量高达一百六十斤，有的地区低到十一斤。如果把山区的粮食产量略微提高一点，把产量较低的特种经济林木的产量提高到现有较高的水平，由于它们的面积很大，就会在近几年内给国家增加大量的财富。另方面，山区尚未开发的可资利用的宜林、宜牧的土地面积很大，其他资源也很多，有些特种经济林木如油桐、柞蚕、油茶等，解放后虽大力恢复，但还没有恢复到战前的最高水平，如果把能够利用的荒山都按照全面规划的要求利用起来；没有恢复到战前最高水平的尽快地加以恢复和发展，有些生产在较短的时期内就会有很大的发展。因此，座谈会认为，就当前对国民经济提供较多的农业、林业、牧业和土特产品来说，大力发展山区生产也极为重要。
    座谈会指出，很多山区都是革命老根据地，老区人民对我国的革命事业有过极大的贡献。解放后几年来在党和政府的扶持、领导下，老区人民的生产和生活虽然有了程度不同的改善，但创伤严重的部分老根据地人民的生活还比较困难。因此，全面发展山区生产不仅有巨大的经济意义，还有重大的政治意义。
    座谈会一致同意的关于山区建设的总目标，是令人欢欣鼓舞的。这个目标是：把现在经济上文化上落后的山区建设成为社会主义的经济上文化上进步、繁荣、康乐幸福的山区。
    为了达到这个目标，座谈会讨论了山区生产建设的方针、任务和应该采取的各项措施。
    关于山区生产建设的方针，是根据山区生产的特点、有利条件和困难因素提出的。这个方针是：要在做好水土保持、力争粮食、油料等自给有余的基础上，有计划地因地制宜地全面地发展农业、林业、牧业和土特产、矿产等多种经济。
    座谈会认为，要想全面发展山区生产必须取得国民经济各部门的密切配合和支援。首先必须逐步地改变山区交通不便的状况，以便运出山区的产品和运进山区人民生产和生活的必需品。为了支援山区生产，加工业、手工业和各种技术人员必须上山，就地取得原料就地加工，制成成品或半成品，以适应交通不便的状况，便于运出。商业工作在促进山区生产上极为重要，座谈会认为必须在山区中建成商业网；地广人稀的山区可以委托农业合作社代购代销，以便收购山区农民的各种产品；有些产品的收购价格不够合理的应该予以调整，以刺激农民的生产积极性。山区的文教卫生事业也必须在生产提高的基础上逐步发展，以便提高山区的文化水平和消灭山区农民的各种疾病。为了做好上述各方面的工作，中央有关各部负责人都在会上提出了支援山区的初步计划。
    党的统一领导，是全面发展山区生产的根本保证。座谈会认为，必须在各级党委的统一领导下，订出短期的和长期的发展山区农业、林业、牧业、副业生产和发展交通运输、利于山区生产的各种小型工业、手工业以及文教卫生事业的全面规划。
    座谈会着重指出，建设山区主要是依靠山区人民。目前山区已完成合作化。因此，必须办好和巩固山区的合作社。为了作好山区工作，各地党委要有计划地动员大批优秀干部和城乡人民上山，要学习甘肃省委“抱着少活十年”的决心建设山区。山区的合作社在社的规模和劳动组织等方面，应该按照山区的特点办事，不要硬搬平原地区的经验。根据山区生产商品性较大的特点，座谈会认为，对山区合作社社员要经常进行社会主义和集体主义的教育极为重要。
