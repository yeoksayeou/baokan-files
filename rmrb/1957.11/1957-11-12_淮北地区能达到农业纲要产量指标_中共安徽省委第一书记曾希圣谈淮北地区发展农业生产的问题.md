    Whether and how to implement the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party concerning the development of agricultural production in the Huaibei region, and whether and how to fulfill the requirements of the Agricultural Development Program, is a matter of public concern. Because Huaibei is prone to both floods and droughts, if Huaibei can achieve this, it will be relatively easier for other regions in Anhui.

    After the Third Plenary Session, Comrade Zeng Xisheng, First Secretary of the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, on his way back from Beijing, together with Vice Governor Wang Guangyu, investigated this issue in the Fuyang and Bengbu areas of Huaibei. They conducted field inspections in seven counties and jointly studied the issue with the heads of more than a dozen counties. Recently, they returned to Hefei, and we went to visit them.

    Comrade Zeng Xisheng spoke to us in detail about the future of agricultural development in Huaibei.

    He first introduced the basic situation of the Huaibei region. He said that Huaibei has 45 million mu of arable land, accounting for more than half of the total arable land in Anhui Province, and a population of 12 million, accounting for 37.5% of the province's population. This region is a plain with very good soil, but it is also a nationally known disaster area. Since liberation, the area affected by floods has averaged more than 15 million mu per year, and the total grain production reduction in recent years has been more than 10 billion jin. Moreover, due to drought, wheat often cannot be sown in time, and yields are greatly affected. Although Huai River management and small-scale water conservancy projects have achieved considerable results, the threat of disasters is still great, and objective conditions are more difficult. Therefore, in the past, there were concerns about whether Huaibei could meet the target of an average grain yield of 500 jin per mu as required by the Agricultural Development Program.

    After conducting specific research in Huaibei with local cadres and the masses, it was felt that we had overestimated the difficulties in the past. Everyone believes that there are many objective and favorable conditions for increasing production in Huaibei. As long as we make subjective efforts and utilize these conditions, we can not only reach a yield of 500 jin within ten years, but also possibly exceed it ahead of schedule. The most important thing is to solve the water conservancy problem.

    Comrade Zeng Xisheng said that the key to increasing yields in Huaibei is to solve the water conservancy problem. He said that the methods of Huai River management proposed by the Provincial Party Committee in the past are generally applicable, such as digging ditches, building weirs, and changing to rice cultivation. A plan was also proposed to control waterlogging by changing to rice cultivation (because rice is water-tolerant and is not greatly affected by 200-300 mm of rain in one or two days, but dryland crops cannot withstand it). However, the past methods mostly relied on lifting water from rivers for irrigation, so progress was relatively slow. From the current point of view, Huaibei still has a large amount of groundwater that can be utilized, so the area and speed of rice cultivation can be greatly expanded and accelerated. In other words, the possibility of eliminating general waterlogging is also greater.

    He said that we had previously advocated digging ponds to store water in Huaibei, but it did not develop on a large scale due to the resistance of some comrades who believed that it was not suitable to dig ponds in plain areas, as well as right-leaning ideas. This time, seeing the good effect of some deep ponds in Huaibei strengthened our courage to dig ponds. He analyzed the characteristics of deep ponds and compared them with well digging. He said that digging ponds (with springs inside) can not only intercept surface water but also utilize groundwater. The water source is sufficient, and the irrigation effect is greater than that of wells. The temperature of pond water for irrigation is also better than well water. He said that he saw a large pond in Xinhua Agricultural Cooperative in Fuyang County, 120 meters long, 20 meters wide at the top, 6 meters wide at the bottom, and 4.5 meters deep, which can irrigate 300 mu of paddy fields once every five days. Its effect is equivalent to thirty large brick wells. However, compared to wells, it is cheaper and easier to use. According to calculations, 3,900 workdays are required to build thirty brick wells, and a large amount of materials are needed, such as bricks, wood, iron wire, and lime, totaling 4,000 yuan. However, this deep pond in Xinhua Cooperative only used 4,000 workdays when digging, and no other materials are needed except for the spring eyes. The technology is also low, and each workday costs 0.5 yuan, which only costs 200 yuan. The water lifting tools are also not restricted, and any water wheel tools can be used, unlike using well water to irrigate the land, which is limited to horse-drawn water carts. In addition, the pond water has a large surface area, which can also be used for raising fish and ducks, planting various aquatic feeds, and planting trees around it, which is also of great benefit to regulating the climate in Huaibei. Judging from the investigated groundwater conditions, digging deep ponds is suitable in various parts of Huaibei. This solves the water source problem for changing to rice cultivation and also strengthens the courage of the people of Huaibei to fight drought and eliminate waterlogging and increase production.

    Comrade Zeng Xisheng said that because it has been discovered that a large amount of groundwater can be utilized in Huaibei, the work of building water conservancy projects in the Huaibei region this year will focus on digging deep ponds, opening ditches, building weirs, building sluice gates (on major rivers), and digging wells (on slopes), gradually utilizing both surface water and groundwater together. According to the situation in various places, it seems that the Huaibei region can complete 400 million cubic meters of earthwork this winter and next spring, which is more than double the projects in the winter of 1955 and the spring of 1956. As long as water conservancy is carried out in this way, 4 billion cubic meters of earthwork can be completed in ten years, and 40% to 50% of the land in Huaibei can be planted with rice, and the face of Huaibei can undergo fundamental changes. The 530,000 mu of rice newly planted in the Fuyang area this year has generally reached a yield of about 500 jin per mu. If the water conservancy is well-built, and fertilizers can also be solved, and a season of wheat can be harvested before planting rice, then, ten years later, the two seasons of wheat and rice may reach a yield of 800 jin per mu. In addition to paddy fields, there will still be 50% to 60% of dry land at that time. If the water problem is truly solved within ten years, and all dry land is turned into irrigated land, and wheat fields can be irrigated frequently and fertilized, then it is also very possible to achieve an average yield of 250 to 300 jin per mu for one season of wheat. This year, more than 1 million mu of wheat in Huaibei have reached a yield of more than 200 jin per mu. After the wheat, another season of high-yielding corn can be planted, and it is not too difficult to harvest 250 jin per mu, and the two items combined are also more than 500 jin. In short, judging from the objective conditions in Huaibei, it is possible to reach and exceed the target of 500 jin per mu as required by the Agricultural Development Program within ten years. The most important thing is to solve the water conservancy problem.

  Solving the Fertilizer Problem Requires Determination

    After Comrade Zeng Xisheng finished talking about the water conservancy problem, he talked about the second problem that must be solved for the development of agriculture in Huaibei, namely the fertilizer problem. In Huaibei, talking about the fertilizer problem is truly a special problem, and it can simply be said to be a task of changing customs. In the past, because there were many disasters in Huaibei and production was unreliable, the masses did not have the habit of accumulating fertilizer. Everywhere there were people without toilets and pigs without pens, and very good human and animal manure was lost due to sun and rain. Since liberation, the party and government leaders of Anhui have repeatedly called on various places to build toilets and livestock pens. Although many have been built by the side of villages and roads until now, they have not been universally built, and the toilets that have been built are not up to standard. The manure is still on the ground in the toilets, still exposed to the sun and rain, and there is a lack of manure cellars, so the manure cannot be stored, and a lot is still lost. Comrade Zeng Xisheng said that this time in Huaibei, some methods were studied with comrades from various places, and the comrades in various places also strengthened their confidence to solve this problem. The method is to establish a fertilizer infrastructure group (or team) within the agricultural cooperative, specifically responsible for helping each household build toilets, manure pits, pig and sheep pens, etc. The work points of the infrastructure group are recorded by the cooperative, and the materials are provided by the public accumulation fund, without increasing the burden on the cooperative members. Everyone believes that by doing this, toilets, pig and sheep pens, etc., will be built quickly. In addition, kiln masters were also found to study the design of manure tanks, and a large number of manure tanks will be fired and supplied to the masses starting this winter. It is estimated that human manure and urine alone can accumulate 1,000 jin per person per year, which can solve the needs of two mu of land for planting one season of crops a year.

    Comrade Zeng Xisheng pointed out that another researched method of accumulating fertilizer is to raise a large number of pigs. He said that if each household raises three pigs, and each pig can traditionally provide fertilizer for three mu of land, each family can solve the fertilizer for planting nine mu of land for one season just by raising pigs. He went on to say that to raise more livestock, it is necessary to solve the fuel problem in Huaibei at the same time. Because most of the various grasses and fodder in Huaibei are used for fuel, resulting in a great shortage of livestock feed. Huaibei has a lot of land, and a household of five people can have fifteen mu of land. Taking one mu of land to plant reeds, each mu generally yields 5,000 jin. According to the habit of the army, one person needs three jin of fuel per day, and the whole family needs fifteen jin per day. Planting only one mu of reeds will solve the fuel for the whole year. Reeds can be planted in low-lying areas, which are often difficult to harvest even if crops are planted, so this method will not have a big impact on grain production. By saving fodder, raising more livestock, and increasing the fertilizer, the low-yielding crops can be changed into high-yielding crops, so in fact, it is still a good method for increasing production. In addition to planting reeds and advocating planting firewood willows in front of and behind houses, it is also planned to develop small coal mines as much as possible to completely solve the fuel problem, to increase feed and fertilizer.

    Comrade Zeng Xisheng said that according to the results of the research in Huaibei, the fertilizer problem for 65% of the cultivated land can be solved by the above methods. He said, where does the remaining 35% of the fertilizer come from? This depends on planting green manure. If Huaibei plans to sow one season of green manure on 30% of the cultivated land, and intercrop 20% of green manure, 50% of the cultivated land can be planted with green manure. In addition to wheat fields, strive to plant green manure on the remaining land in winter without leaving it idle. This requirement can be achieved, and it is estimated that it can be done by 1960. One mu of green manure can be enough for two mu of land to plant one season of crops, or it can be used for one mu of land to plant two seasons. In this way, the fertilizer problem for the remaining 35% to 40% of the area in Huaibei will be largely solved. If chemical fertilizers are added, it can be solved completely. He finally said that Huaibei has a solution to the fertilizer problem, and the key lies in the determination to change the habit of not accumulating fertilizer.

    Do a Good Job in Rectification and Lay a Solid Ideological Foundation

    Comrade Zeng Xisheng finally said that the basic conditions for agricultural development in Huaibei are good, but ultimately, it is necessary to solve ideological problems first. If the ideological problem is not solved and there is no subjective initiative, good conditions will also turn into bad conditions. He said that the main obstacle to the development of agricultural production is right-leaning conservative thinking. The rightists said that everything was ruined, and those with serious right-leaning thinking also staggered and shouted along. Now they have all been criticized, some have turned around, and some are turning around. However, right-leaning conservative thinking in production is widespread among farmers, not only among wealthy farmers, but also among ordinary older farmers. Some people also use the slogan of "adapting to local conditions" as a protective shield for right-leaning conservatism and adopt a passive attitude. Therefore, to fulfill the requirements of the Agricultural Development Program, it is necessary to vigorously educate cadres and the masses to overcome conservative thinking. On the other hand, it is also necessary to establish a style of seeking truth from facts. Some people, if you let them make plans, they can make plans for increasing production many years later, and the indicators are also very good-looking, but there is no reliable basis and no reliable method. This phenomenon of empty talk about increasing production should be prevented in the future. In addition, it is also necessary to overcome the mentality of dependence. People with this mentality want money everywhere and think that nothing can be done without money or with little money. If this mentality is not changed, it will also be a major obstacle to the development of agricultural production.

    Comrade Zeng Xisheng went on to talk about changing working methods and improving work style. He said that in the past, we knew the working method of "from the masses, to the masses" in theory. In actual work, we also knew that to come from the masses is to do more investigation and research. But how to go to the masses? How to turn correct things into the things of the masses? There are fewer methods in this regard. As a result, originally good things were forced and ordered in the process of implementation, and they were done badly. Now Chairman Mao has told us a good way to go to the masses, which is the method of debate. It should be known that even a good thing will inevitably be opposed by some people at the beginning. Through the masses' own debate, a high degree of democracy and a high degree of self-education are brought into play. By combining democracy and education in mass debates, the party's policies and guidelines are turned into the things of the masses, so there will never be the phenomenon of "you hit me and I understand," or "if my thinking doesn't agree, I will obey the organization." Therefore, to solve the ideological problems of the masses, it is necessary to first solve the working methods and work style problems of the leadership, which is the key to mobilizing the masses and ensuring the good development of agricultural production.

    Comrade Zeng Xisheng finally said: Chairman Mao told us that "rectification is the key to all work." This sentence has become very obvious to the cadres and masses in Huaibei, which is mainly manifested in the transformation of right-leaning thinking and the general rise in enthusiasm for production. Taking drought resistance and wheat planting as an example, from children to old people of seventy or eighty years old, from farmers to people from all walks of life in industry, commerce, and education, all participated together. The tools used ranged from water pumps to small urine jars and small ladles. Each person can only plant an average of one to two tenths of a mu of wheat per day, but even in this difficult situation, the progress of wheat planting has kept up with and surpassed the progress of the same period last year. This has never happened before. From here, we are even more aware that it is the most reliable foundation for realizing the Agricultural Development Program to make up our minds, combine it with the vigorous blooming and contending, rectify the agricultural cooperatives well, and solve the ideological problems of the cooperative members and the production management of the cooperatives.

    淮北地区能达到农业纲要产量指标
    ——中共安徽省委第一书记曾希圣谈淮北地区发展农业生产的问题
    本报记者　于明　于风
    在淮北这个地区，怎样贯彻执行中共三中全会关于发展农业生产的精神，能否完成以及如何完成农业发展纲要提出的要求，这是人们所关心的问题。因为淮北多涝多旱，如果淮北能够完成，那末在安徽其他地区来说，就比较容易一些。
    三中全会以后，中共安徽省委第一书记曾希圣同志，为了弄清这一问题，从北京回来的途中，便偕同副省长王光宇同志，到淮北的阜阳、蚌埠两专区研究了这个问题。他们在七个县作了实地考察，又和十几个县的负责人共同进行了研究。最近他们回到合肥，我们便去访问了他们。
    曾希圣同志对我们详细地谈论了淮北农业发展的前途。
    他首先介绍了淮北地区的基本情况。他说，淮北有四千五百万亩耕地，占安徽全省耕地面积的一半以上，有一千二百万人口，占全省人口的37．5％。这个地区是平原，土地很好，但却是闻名全国的灾区。从解放以来，因涝成灾的面积，平均每年总在一千五百万亩以上，几年来减产的粮食合计一百多亿斤。又由于干旱，小麦也常常不能及时播种，产量很受影响。治淮、兴修小型水利，虽然已经收到不小成效，但是灾害的威胁还很大，客观条件要困难一些，所以，过去对淮北能否完成农业发展纲要所要求的粮食平均亩产五百斤的指标问题，比较担心。
    这次在淮北和当地干部及群众具体研究以后，却感到我们过去对困难估计得多了一些。大家认为，淮北增产的客观有利条件不少，只要主观努力，利用这些条件，不但在十年内能够达到五百斤产量，而且可能提前超过。最主要的是解决水利问题
    曾希圣同志说，淮北提高产量的关键，是解决水利问题。他说，过去省委提出的治淮办法，一般都是可用的，如开沟打圩、改种水稻等，并曾提出过以改种水稻的办法来治理内涝的方案（因为水稻耐水，在一二天内下两三百公厘雨所受影响不大，但旱粮作物就抵不住）。但过去的办法多仰赖从河里提水灌溉，所以进行得比较缓慢。从现在看来，淮北还有大量地下水可以利用，因此种水稻的面积和速度就可大大扩大和加快。也就是说，消除一般涝灾的可能性也更大了。
    他说，我们过去曾提倡在淮北挖塘蓄水，也因某些同志认为平原地区不宜于挖塘以及右倾思想的抵抗，没有大量发展。这次在淮北看到一些深塘的作用很好，因而增强了挖塘的勇气。他分析了深塘的特点，并与打井作了一个比较。他说，挖塘（塘内再下泉眼）既能拦蓄地面水，又能利用地下水，水源充足，灌溉作用比井大，塘水灌溉的温度也好于井水。他说，他看到阜阳县新华农业社有一口大塘，长一百二十公尺，宽顶二十公尺，底六公尺，深四点五公尺，每五天浇一次水，能供应三百亩水稻田用。它的作用能抵三十口大砖井。可是它比起井来，却省钱好用。据计算，三十口砖井要用三千九百个工才能做成，用的材料很多，要大量砖头、木料、铁丝、石灰等，总共需四千元。可是新华社这口深塘，在挖时只用了四千个工，除下泉眼外，其他材料都不需要，技术性也低，每工五角，只要二百元就行了。抽水工具也不受限制，什么车水工具都可使用，不比用井水灌地，只限于马拉水车。另外，塘水面大，还可养鱼、养鸭子，种各种水生饲料，周围可植树，对调节淮北气候也大有好处。从调查过的地下水的情况看来，淮北各地挖深塘都是适宜的。这就解决了改种水稻的水源问题，同时也使淮北人民增强了抗旱除涝、增加生产的勇气。
    曾希圣同志说，因为发现了淮北有大量地下水可利用，所以淮北地区今年兴修水利的工作，将着重在挖深塘，开水沟，打圩，修闸（在主要河流上），打井（在坡地）等方面，把地上水和地下水都逐步地一齐利用起来。根据各地情况看来，今冬明春淮北地区将可作到四亿土方，比1955年冬和1956年春的工程还要高过一倍。水利只要这样做下去，十年可做到四十亿土方，淮北将有40％到50％的土地都可种水稻，淮北面貌即可发生根本变化。阜阳专区今年改种的五十三万亩水稻，一般亩产量都已达到五百斤左右。如果水利修得好，肥料也能解决，栽稻之前再收一季小麦呢，那么，十年以后，麦稻两季可能达到亩产八百斤。除了水稻田外，那时还有50％到60％的旱地。如果在十年内确实解决了水的问题，把所有旱地变成水浇地，麦地能经常溉溉，又有肥料，那末一季小麦达到每亩平均二百五十斤到三百斤的产量，也是大有可能的。今年淮北已有一百多万亩小麦达到亩产二百斤以上了。麦后再种一季高产玉米，每亩收二百五十斤也不太困难，两项合计也在五百斤以上。总之，从淮北的客观条件看来，十年内达到和超过农业发展纲要所要求的亩产五百斤的目标，是可以的。最主要的一条，在于解决水利问题。
  解决肥料问题要下决心
    曾希圣同志谈完水利问题，便谈到淮北发展农业必须解决的第二个问题，即肥料问题。在淮北，谈起肥料问题，真是一个特殊问题，简直可以说是一件移风易俗的工作。淮北过去因为灾害多，生产不可靠，所以群众没有积肥习惯，到处都是人无厕所，猪无圈，很好的人畜粪都被日晒雨淋流失了。解放以来，安徽党政领导曾一再号召各地修建厕所和牲畜圈，到现在虽然在村旁道旁已经修建了不少，但还没有普遍修起来，而且修的厕所也不合乎标准，粪便在厕所里的地上，还是被日晒雨淋，又缺少粪窖，粪便不能贮藏，仍然流失很多。曾希圣同志说，这次在淮北和各地同志研究了一些办法，各地同志也加强了信心来解决这个问题。办法是，在农业社内成立肥料基建组（或队），专门负责帮助每家修建厕所、粪坑、猪羊圈等。基建组的工分由社记，材料由公积金出，不增加社员的负担。大家认为这样做，就会很快地把厕所猪羊圈等修建起来。另外还找了窑师研究了如何做粪缸的式样，从今冬起将要大量烧制粪缸供应群众。据估计，单是人的粪尿每人一年能积一千斤，就可解决二亩地一年种一季庄稼的需要。
    曾希圣同志指出，另一个研究过的积肥办法，就是大量养猪。他说，每户养到三口猪，一口猪按习惯可供三亩地的肥料，每家只靠养猪就可解决九亩地种一季的肥料。他接着说，要多养牲畜，就得同时解决淮北的燃料问题。因为淮北的各种草料，大部都作燃料用掉了，结果牲畜饲料大感不足。淮北土地多，一户五口人可合到十五亩地，拿一亩地种芦苇，每亩一般收五千斤，按部队习惯算，一人一天需三斤燃料，全家一天需十五斤，只种一亩芦苇就把一年的燃料解决了。芦苇可利用水洼地种，这种地经常是种了庄稼也难保收，所以这个办法也不会对粮食产量有什么大影响，而节省了草料，多养牲畜，多增加的肥料又可把高粱低产作物改成高产作物，所以实际上仍是一个增产的好办法。除了种芦苇和在门前门后提倡栽柴柳外，还拟尽可能地开发小煤窑，彻底解决燃料问题，以增加饲料和肥料。
    曾希圣同志说，在淮北研究的结果，靠以上办法就可解决65％耕地的肥料问题。他说，其余35％的肥料从那里来呢？这就要靠种绿肥了。淮北有计划地在30％的耕地上播种一季绿肥，另外套种20％的绿肥，即可达到50％的耕地种绿肥。除麦地外，争取其余土地冬季都不休闲而种绿肥，这个要求可以实现，而且估计到1960年便可做到。一亩地绿肥可够二亩地种一季庄稼用，也可供一亩地种两季用。这样，淮北地区另外35％到40％的肥料问题，也就大体上得到了解决，如果再加化肥，就可根本解决，他最后说，淮北解决肥料的办法是有的，关键在于下决心改变不积肥的习惯。
    作好整风工作打下思想基础
    曾希圣同志最后说，淮北发展农业的基本条件是好的，但是归根还要首先解决思想问题。思想问题不解决，没有主观积极性，好条件也会变成坏条件。他说，发展农业生产的主要障碍，是右倾保守思想。右派分子说什么都搞坏了，有严重右倾思想的人也踉踉跄跄的跟着叫喊。现在已经都受到了批判，有的已经转过来，有的正在转。但是在生产上的右倾保守思想，在农民中是普遍存在的，不仅富裕农民有，就是一般的老年农民也有。有些人还用“因地制宜”的口号，作右倾保守的护身符，而采取了消极态度。所以，要想完成农业发展纲要的要求，就要大力教育干部和群众克服保守思想。另一方面也要树立实事求是的作风。有些人，你让他订计划，多少年以后的增产计划都可给你订出来，指标也很好看，就是没有可靠的根据，没有可靠的办法，这种空喊增产的现象，以后要防止。此外，还要克服依赖思想。有这种思想的人是处处都要钱，认为无钱和钱少，都不能办事。这种思想如不转变，对发展农业生产也将是一个大障碍。
    曾希圣同志接着谈到改变工作方法，改进作风的问题。他说，我们过去对“从群众中来到群众中去”的工作方法，在理论上知道。在实际工作中，也知道要从群众中来就是要多调查研究。但是如何到群众中去呢？如何把正确的东西变成群众的东西呢？这方面的办法就少了。结果本来是好的东西，在推行中有了强迫命令，就做坏了。现在毛主席告诉了我们一个到群众中去的好方法，就是辩论的方法。须知即使一件好事，开始也难免不会有人反对。通过群众自己的辩论，就发挥了高度民主，又发挥了高度的自我教育作用。把民主与教育结合于群众性的辩论之中，就把党的方针政策变成群众的东西了，这样就再也不会有过去那样“你打我通”，或
  “思想不通组织服从”的现象。所以要解决群众的思想问题，首先要解决领导上的工作方法和作风问题，这是动员群众，保证农业生产很好发展的关键。
    曾希圣同志最后说：毛主席告诉我们“整风是一切工作之纲”。这句话，在淮北的干部和群众中已经看得很明显，主要表现在右倾思想有了转变，生产积极性普遍高涨。就拿抗旱种麦来说，从小孩到七八十岁的老年人，从农民到工商学各界都一齐参加了；所用的工具，从抽水机到小尿罐、小瓢都用上了。每天平均一人只能种一分到二分地的麦，但就是在这种艰苦的情况下，种麦进度也跟上和超过去年同期的进度。这是过去从来没有的。从这里就更加使我们认识到，下定决心，结合大鸣大放把农业社整顿好，解决农业社社员的思想问题和社的生产管理等问题，是实现农业发展纲要的最可靠的基础。
