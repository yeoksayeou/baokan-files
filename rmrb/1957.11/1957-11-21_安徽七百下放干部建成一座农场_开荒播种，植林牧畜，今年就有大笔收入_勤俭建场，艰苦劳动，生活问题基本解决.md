Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 20th - More than seven hundred cadres from Anhui Province's financial and trade system have built a Zhou Wang Farm in the barren mountains more than forty miles southwest of Xuan Cheng County. In the past eight months, they have reclaimed more than 5,000 mu of wasteland, planting peanuts, sweet potatoes, radishes, medicinal herbs, orchards, and young forests in five operational areas; at the same time, they have raised more than 500 breeding pigs and rabbits, as well as a large number of chickens, bees, and fish. Among the diverse economic productions they have pioneered, with the exception of the vermicelli factory and oil extraction factory which have not yet been put into production, and the longer production cycles of animal husbandry and forestry, the agricultural crops alone, including peanuts, sweet potatoes, and radishes, can yield 2.5 million jin this autumn, with a total value of 90,000 yuan.

The more than seven hundred cadres who built the farm were those who were streamlined from Anhui Province's financial and trade system during the reorganization at the beginning of this year. Relevant units adopted the policy of "facing the countryside and facing production" when arranging these cadres. The farm implemented the spirit of "building the farm thriftily" during the construction process. In the early stages of construction, many cadres lived in cowsheds and dug earth to make stoves. The farm's leaders led everyone in opening up wasteland for planting, afforestation, and animal husbandry, striving for income this year; at the same time, they raised building materials and successively constructed 852 various houses. In addition to offices and dormitories, they also built clinics, canteens, supply and marketing cooperatives, warehouses, and basketball courts. The problems existing in the lives of cadres have been basically solved.

When the cadres participating in the farm construction first arrived, their thinking was relatively chaotic. Some felt that there was no future, and others were afraid of hardship. However, with the growth of crops and the gradual improvement of living conditions, the cadres' thinking has also stabilized. Through several months of labor practice, they have learned many skills such as feeding pigs, raising rabbits, digging the ground, sowing seeds, weeding, and fertilizing. The phenomenon of not being able to carry on their shoulders or lift with their hands has been eliminated. When sowing in the spring, many people complained that carrying fertilizer was "heavy labor," but now everyone is scrambling to carry loads of peanuts weighing more than one hundred jin. Many people who could not distinguish between the five grains when they came have now been trained into production experts. In August of this year, 131 male and female production activists were selected from the entire farm. The idea of settling down and establishing a career has also gradually taken root. More than two hundred cadres have now brought their families to the farm, and some have even spent their own money to build houses on the mountain, preparing to make the farm their home for the long term.

In order to strive for a greater harvest next year, tractors are now running day and night on the wasteland. This winter and next spring, the planting area of crops (including hemp, tobacco, and medicinal herbs) will be expanded to more than 12,000 mu; the planting area of various economic forests and orchards will reach more than 28,700 mu next year; the number of cattle, sheep, pigs, rabbits, chickens, etc. will also increase several times compared to this year next year. In addition, the vermicelli factory, oil extraction factory, sauce workshop, flour mill, medicinal herb processing factory, and iron and wood factory, which are planned to be built, will also be put into production one after another next year. The farm's staff have also proposed to strive to achieve self-sufficiency and profitability within five years.

    安徽七百下放干部建成一座农场
    开荒播种，植林牧畜，今年就有大笔收入
    勤俭建场，艰苦劳动，生活问题基本解决
    新华社合肥20日电　安徽省财贸系统的七百多名干部在宣城县西南四十多里的荒山里建设了一个周王农场。八个月来，他们在这里开垦了荒地五千多亩，在五个作业区里种植了花生、山芋、萝卜、药材、果园和幼林；同时还喂养了五百多头种猪、种兔以及大批的鸡、蜂、鱼。在他们开辟的多种经济生产中，除副业粉丝厂、榨油厂还未投入生产，畜牧、林业生产周期较长外，农作物中仅花生、山芋、萝卜三项今秋就可收二百五十万斤，总值达九万元。
    建设农场的这七百多名干部是安徽省财贸系统在今年年初进行整编时紧缩下来的。有关单位在安排这些干部时采取了“面向农村、面向生产”的方针。农场在建设过程中贯彻了“勤俭建场”的精神，许多干部建场初期寄居牛棚、挖土做灶、农场的领导人员领导大家一边开荒抢种、植林、牧畜，争取今年就有收入；一面筹集建筑材料，陆续建筑了各种房舍八百五十二间，除办公室、宿舍外，还建筑了卫生所、食堂、供销部、仓库和篮球场，干部生活上存在的问题都已基本解决。
    参加农场建设的干部，初来时思想上比较混乱，有的认为没有前途，有的怕吃苦，但随着农作物的生长和生活条件的逐渐改善，干部思想也都稳定下来。通过几个月的劳动实践，他们学会了喂猪、养兔、挖地、播种、锄草、施肥等很多本领。肩不能挑、手不能拿的现象已经消灭。春季播种时很多人叫喊挑肥料是“重劳动”，现在一百多斤重的花生挑子大家都抢着去挑。不少人来时五谷不分，现在都已经锻炼成生产能手。今年8月间，全场评出的男女生产积极分子就有一百三十一人。安家立业的思想也已逐渐建立起来，现在已有二百多个干部把家属接到农场来，有的人还自己花钱在山上建造了住房，准备长期以农场为家。
    为了争取明年更大的丰收，目前拖拉机正日夜不停地在荒地上奔驰。今冬明春，农作物的播种面积（包括麻、烟、药材）将扩大到一万二千多亩；各种经济林、果林种植面积明年要达到二万八千七百多亩；牛、羊、猪、兔、鸡等的数量明年也将比今年增加数倍。此外，计划兴建的粉丝厂、榨油厂、酱坊，粉厂、药材加工厂、铁木厂等也将在明年陆续投入生产。农场的工作人员们还提出要争取在五年内达到自给和盈利。
