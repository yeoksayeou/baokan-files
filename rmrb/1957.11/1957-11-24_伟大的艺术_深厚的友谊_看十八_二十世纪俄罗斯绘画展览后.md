Great Art, Profound Friendship
    —After Seeing the Exhibition of 18th-20th Century Russian Paintings
    Wu Zuoren
    In the days when the working people of the world are warmly and joyously celebrating the 40th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution, our capital is holding an exhibition of original Russian paintings from the 18th to 20th centuries, marking the strengthening of Sino-Soviet cultural exchange and the consolidation and development of fraternal friendship. Such an exhibition is the first of its kind in the history of our country's international cultural exchanges.
    These invaluable exhibits are a selection of oil paintings from the Leningrad State Russian Museum in the Soviet Union. They represent the development of Russian painting from the second half of the 18th century to the beginning of the 20th century, a period of nearly a century and a half, including sixty-three carefully selected works by forty-five outstanding painters from Ф·С· Rokotov (1736-1808) to В·А· Serov (1865-1911).
    Ancient Russian art was almost entirely in the service of religion, and countless anonymous craftsmen created countless works with piety. At the beginning of the 18th century, Peter the Great reformed the feudal and backward Russia. On a new economic basis, after art was freed from the shackles of religious themes, secular art that expressed human life appeared in art. Although Russian art gradually converged with European art in terms of expression techniques during this period, the characteristics of the Russian nation were not obscured by the new art form, but vividly and profoundly depicted the inner emotions of the characters in each work.
    In a society ruled by the aristocratic class, upper-class figures were the scope of artistic activities for painters at that time. Although painters also vividly expressed the pomp and circumstance of the powerful, portrait paintings, which were popular for a while, still revealed people's inner activities under the hands of masters: such as Ф·С· Rokotov's portrait of Ц·г· Orlov and later portrait paintings, the painter placed the natural scenery behind the characters, such as В·Л· Borovikovsky (1757-1825)'s portrait of the Duchess Gagarin, although official, it was full of radiance. In the early 19th century, К·Л· Bryullov (1799-1852), the author of the famous work "The Last Day of Pompeii," overcame the then-popular academic rules and created bold and excellent portrait paintings. His "Portrait of Doctor and Writer В·И· Orlov" is on display at the exhibition.
    After the Russian people crushed Napoleon's invasion in 1812, common people, who were despised by the upper class, also became the objects of painting. At this time, А·Г· Venetsianov (1780-1847) praised the simple farmers from his early years of genius. The "Reaper" created in 1820 can be said to be a model of Russian realistic portrait painting. Since then, the range of themes of ordinary people expressed by Russian painters has expanded. This direction of realism, which has taken a step forward in art, will inevitably be reflected in the works of his descendants, such as the portraits of farmers and scholars painted by outstanding И·Н· Kramskoy (1837-1887), Н·Н· Gay (1831-1894), etc., which can illustrate this point.
    In the second half of the nineteenth century, the famous democratic revolutionary Chernyshevsky raised the banner of critical realism. Under the influence of this thought, painters should not only depict real life without embellishment, but also have criticism, satire and praise. Like-minded painters formed the Association of Traveling Art Exhibitions. They walked out of the conservative academy and plunged into life. В·Г· Perov (1833-1882), И·Н· Kramskoy, И·И· Shishkin (1832-1898), etc. were the initiators of this traveling exhibition school. This has given new content to genre paintings, which accounted for the main proportion at that time. At the exhibition, Perov's small "Hunters at Rest," К·В· Lemokh's "Lonely and Helpless," В·Е· Makovsky's "In the Mediation Judge's Room" and other paintings, show the trend of genre paintings during this period.
    Russian landscapes, from the early landscape master Ф·Я· Koryksieyev (1753-1824)'s "On the Neva River" to И·И· Levitan (1861-1900)'s "Moonlight," have indeed left many valuable legacies in this century-long history. А·К· Savrasov (1830-1897)'s "Thaw," И·И· Shishkin's "Forest" and "Coast," А·И· Kuindzhi (1842-1910)'s "Evening in Ukraine," and the landscape paintings of many painters, all express the changes of light and darkness, cold and warmth on the Russian land with realistic creation methods, and the concern between people and nature. Each work is filled with the author's patriotic passion and poetry.
    The works of three artistic giants at the turn of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries have profound and touching power. These are: individual figure drafts in two masterpieces by В·И· Surikov (1848-1916): "Cossacks" and "Soldiers"; three portraits by И·Е· Repin (1844-1930): "Portrait of a Black Woman," "Portrait of Surgeon Pirogov," and "Portrait of Composer Н·А· Rimsky-Korsakov," and the youngest of them, В·А· Serov (1865-1911)'s "Portrait of А·Н· Durnachinin." These outstanding works can be said to fully demonstrate the painter's superb skills. The simplicity of its style and the conciseness of its expression methods can be described as reaching a state of wonder. The painters have so successfully conveyed the spiritual state and inner activities of the characters. It can be appreciated that the masters can truly integrate their keen feelings with the audience's thinking activities through skilled brushstrokes and delicate and varied tones, and every stroke can strike the heartstrings of the audience.
    Such an exhibition of great significance undoubtedly brings great joy to Chinese audiences who love the Russian art heritage, enhances our understanding of Russian painting, and will certainly be of great help to our learning. Because only through the original works can we understand the spiritual features of oil painting's tonal differences, brushstrokes, and other modeling characteristics; this is by no means something that a printed reproduction can replace.

    伟大的艺术　深厚的友谊
    ——看十八——二十世纪俄罗斯绘画展览后
    吴作人
    在全世界劳动人民热烈而欢腾地庆祝伟大十月社会主义革命四十周年的日子里，我国首都举办十八—二十世纪俄罗斯绘画的原作展览会，标志着中苏文化交流的加强，和兄弟友谊的巩固与发展。这样的展览会，在我国国际文化交流的历史上，是第一次。
    这些无比珍贵的展品是从苏联列宁格勒国立俄罗斯博物馆中选出的一部分油画。它代表着俄罗斯从十八世纪下半叶，到二十世纪初，近一个半世纪间绘画的发展面貌；其中包括由Ф·С·罗柯托夫（1736—1808）起，到В·А·谢罗夫（1865—1911）四十五位杰出的画家的六十三幅精心作品。
    俄罗斯的古代艺术，几乎全部是为宗教服务的，多少无名的匠师，虔心地创造了不可数计的作品。到十八世纪初，彼得大帝把封建落后的俄罗斯进行了改革，在新的经济基础上，艺术摆脱了宗教题材的桎梏之后，在艺术上出现了表现人间生活的世俗艺术。尽管这时期俄罗斯的艺术逐渐与欧洲艺术在表现技法上趋于一致，但是俄罗斯民族的特性，并不曾被新的艺术形式所掩盖，而是在每件作品中鲜明而深刻地描绘了人物的内在感情。
    在贵族阶级统治的社会里，上层社会人物，是当时画家艺术活动的范围。画家虽也绘形绘声地表现了权贵的煊赫、排场，可是风行一时的肖像画，仍在大师们手下流露出人们的内心活动：如Ф·С·罗柯托夫画的Ц·г·奥尔格洛夫肖像和较晚的肖像画中，画家把自然风景放在人物后面，如В·Л·波罗维柯夫斯基（1757—1825）画的加加里娜公爵夫人肖像，虽是官样的，但神采奕奕。到了十九世纪的早期，名作“彭拜末日”的作者、天才画家К．Л·勃留洛夫（1799—1852）克服了在当时流行的学院主义的清规戒律，创造了豪放而又优秀的肖像画。会上展出了他的“医生和作家В·И·奥尔洛夫”肖像。
    1812年，俄罗斯人民粉碎了拿破仑的侵略之后，上层人士不屑一顾的平民，也成为绘画描写的对象了。这时的А·Г·维涅齐亚诺夫（1780—1847）从他天才的早年，就歌颂着朴实的农民，如1820年创作的“割麦人”可说是俄罗斯现实主义肖像画的典范。从此俄罗斯画家所表现的普通人物的题材范围扩大了。这个在艺术上进了一步的现实主义的方向必然体现在他的后辈的作品里，如杰出的И·Н·克拉姆斯科依（1837—1887），Н·Н·盖伊（1831—1894）等所画的农民及学者等肖像就可以说明这一点。
    十九世纪的下半叶，著名的民主主义革命家车尔尼雪夫斯基，举起了批判的现实主义的旗帜。在这一思想影响下，画家们不仅对现实生活要不加矫饰的描写，而且要有批判、讽刺和歌颂。志同道合的画家们便组成了流动艺术展览协会。他们走出了保守的学院，投入生活。В·Г·别罗夫（1833—1882），И·Н·克拉姆斯科依，И·И·希施金（1832—1898）等就是这个流动展览派的倡导者。这样就使得当时占主要比重的风俗画，也获得了新的内容。在展览会上，别罗夫的小幅“猎人在休息”，К·В·列莫赫的“孤寡无靠”，В·Е·玛柯夫斯基的“在调解法官室中”等画，就表现着这个时期风俗画的倾向。
    俄罗斯的风景，从早期的风景大家Ф·Я·珂历克塞耶夫（1753—1824）的“涅瓦河上”，到И·И·列维坦（1861—1900）的“月色”，在这一个多世纪的历史中间，确实留下了很多珍贵的遗产。А·К·萨兰拉索夫（1830—1897）的
  “解冻”，И·И·希施金的“森林”和“海岸”，А·И·库因哲（1842—1910）的“乌克兰的傍晚”，以及许多画家的风景画，都以现实主义的创作方法表现了俄罗斯大地的明晦寒温的变化，人和自然之间的关切。每幅作品都洋溢着作者的爱国主义激情和诗意。
    十九世纪与二十世纪交接期间三位艺术巨匠的作品有深刻感人的力量。这些就是：В·И·苏里柯夫（1848—1916）的两幅巨作中的个别人物图稿：“哥萨克人”和“士兵”；И·Е·列宾（1844—1930）的三幅人像：“黑女像”、“外科大夫皮罗戈夫像”和“作曲家Н·А·烈姆斯基—科萨柯夫像”和他们中间最年轻的В·А·谢罗夫（1865—1911）的“А·Н·杜尔查尼诺夫像”。这些杰出的作品，可谓充分地表现了画家的高超技法。其风格的纯朴，表现手法的简练，可谓达到了神妙之境，画家们是如此成功地传出了人物的精神状态，和内心活动。可以体会到大师们是真正能把自己敏锐的感受通过熟练的笔调，细腻而多变化的色调，把画中的人物和观众的思维活动相融洽，每一笔都能扣中观众的心弦。
    这样一个有非常重大意义的展览会，无疑地给热爱俄罗斯艺术遗产的中国观众带来了极大的欢欣，提高了我们对俄罗斯绘画的认识，同时对我们的学习一定有很大的帮助。因为只有通过原作，才能使我们了解到油画的色调参差，笔踪来去等造形特性的精神面貌；对这一点那绝非一帧印刷复制品所能替代。（附图片）
