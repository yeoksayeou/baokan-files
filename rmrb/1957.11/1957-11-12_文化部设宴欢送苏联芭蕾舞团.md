Xinhua News Agency, November 10th: The Ministry of Culture held a banquet in Beijing on the evening of November 10th to bid farewell to the ballet troupe of the Soviet National Novosibirsk Opera and Ballet Theatre. The ballet troupe will visit and perform in Guangzhou before returning to their country.

The head of the ballet troupe, Ligachev, the deputy head, Zelimanov, and all the members of the ballet troupe in Beijing were invited to attend the banquet.

Vice Minister of Culture Xia Yan spoke at the banquet. He said that the ballet troupe had created a new record in China, performing from summer all the way into winter. They not only performed for tens of thousands of Chinese people, but also took the time to teach their valuable experience to our country's dance and music workers. Xia Yan said that the ballet troupe's tireless performances in China have become a model for our literary and art workers to learn from.

At the banquet, Xia Yan also presented the gifts from Premier Zhou Enlai and the Ministry of Culture to the ballet troupe's head, Ligachev.

The head of the ballet troupe, Ligachev, said at the banquet that after arriving in China, they wanted to go beyond the simple scope of "actors performing for the audience." They also expanded the scope of their performances in China, holding performances for Chinese workers, farmers, soldiers, and students. He thanked the Chinese side for all the preparations made for their successful performances. Ligachev finally proposed a toast to the unbreakable friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union.

Vice Minister of Culture Zhang Zhixiang and Deputy Head of the Ballet Troupe Zelimanov also spoke successively. Their speeches, filled with the spirit of friendly cooperation between China and the Soviet Union, were constantly interrupted by warm applause.

After leaving Beijing on the 14th, the ballet troupe will also hold ten performances in Guangzhou.

    文化部设宴欢送苏联芭蕾舞团
    据新华社10日讯　文化部10日晚在北京举行宴会，欢送苏联国立新西伯利亚歌剧芭蕾舞剧院芭蕾舞团。芭蕾舞团将在去广州访问演出后回国。
    芭蕾舞团团长利加乔夫、副团长泽利曼诺夫和芭蕾舞团在北京的全体团员应邀出席了宴会。
    文化部副部长夏衍在宴会上讲话。他说，芭蕾舞团在中国创造了新纪录，由夏天一直演到冬天。他们不仅为成千上万的中国人民演出，而且还抽空把宝贵的经验教给了我国的舞蹈和音乐工作者们。夏衍说，芭蕾舞团在中国不辞辛苦的演出，已成为我国文艺工作者学习的榜样。
    在宴会上，夏衍还把周恩来总理和文化部送给芭蕾舞团的礼品，转交给芭蕾舞团团长利加乔夫。
    芭蕾舞团团长利加乔夫在宴会上说，他们来到中国以后，就想超出单纯的“演员表演给观众看”这个范围。他们在中国还扩大了演出范围，为中国的工人、农民、战士和学生们举行了演出。他感谢中国方面对他们顺利地演出所进行的一切准备工作。利加乔夫最后提议为苏中两国人民牢不可破的友谊干杯。
    文化部副部长张致祥和芭蕾舞团副团长泽利曼诺夫也先后讲了话。他们两人充满了中苏两国友好合作精神的讲话，也不断被热烈的掌声所打断。
    芭蕾舞团14日离开北京后，还将在广州举行十场演出。
