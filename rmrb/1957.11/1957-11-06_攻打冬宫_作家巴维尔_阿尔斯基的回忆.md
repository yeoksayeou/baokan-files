Attacking the Winter Palace
—Memories of Writer Pavel Arsky

Editor’s Note: Pavel Arsky was the son of a bricklayer, and he himself had worked as a bricklayer, boiler worker, sailor, and miner. In 1905, he participated in the revolution in Poltava. In 1915, he was drafted into the Tsar's army and became a soldier in the Pavlovsky Guards Regiment. In February 1917, the soldiers elected him deputy chairman of the regiment's soldiers' committee.

The Pavlovsky Regiment, where Pavel Arsky served, participated in the assault on the Winter Palace and fought for the victory of the October Socialist Revolution. In 1917, the Russian revolutionary movement became increasingly magnificent. Under these circumstances, the Communist Party began to prepare for armed uprising. According to the Party Central Committee's directive of October 12 (October 25, Gregorian calendar), the Petrograd Soviet established the Military Revolutionary Committee, which was the combat organ for preparing and carrying out the armed uprising. The leadership core of the Military Revolutionary Committee was the Party Central Committee elected at the enlarged meeting of the Party Central Committee on October 16.

On October 24 (November 6, Gregorian calendar), the headquarters of the Red Guards received an order from the Military Revolutionary Committee to mobilize all forces for combat readiness. On this very day, Lenin arrived at the Smolny Palace and directly took charge of the leadership of the uprising.

…That night is unforgettable for me. The Winter Palace, where the bourgeois Provisional Government was entrenched, was surrounded from all sides. The voices of the Red Guards, soldiers, and sailors were heard from time to time in the cold air. Their coats were soaked by rain and snow. On the parade ground of Petrograd, piles of campfires were lit, and the soldiers warmed their hands there.

Our Pavlovsky Regiment was ready for battle. The soldiers were very anxious, but we had to wait for the instructions of the Military Revolutionary Committee to act.

To avoid bloodshed, the Military Revolutionary Committee issued an ultimatum to the Provisional Government, demanding their surrender within twenty minutes.

The appointed time arrived. At this last moment, we received the Provisional Government's reply. They requested an extension of ten more minutes. The Military Revolutionary Committee agreed to this. Everyone was watching the clock. When the time was up again, the Winter Palace remained silent. It was obvious that the Provisional Government was playing tricks, deceiving the insurgent masses, and desperately trying to buy time. It still hoped that reinforcements would arrive from the front at any moment.

The Military Revolutionary Committee ordered: the attack on the Winter Palace begins.

The signal for the attack was familiar to all our soldiers and commanders of the revolutionary forces: as soon as a red signal light was lit in the sky above the Peter and Paul Fortress, the cruiser “Aurora” would immediately open fire. The tension had reached its peak. Let’s do it! …

High above the spire of the fortress, a red star rose. It was 9:40 PM. The cruiser "Aurora" fired its guns. The Red Guards, soldiers, and sailors bravely, resolutely, and unitedly began the battle. The shouts of the people were intertwined with the sound of machine guns and the whistling of bullets. Continuous firing, rising and falling, tore through the night.

The Pavlovsky Regiment, together with the Red Guards from the Petrograd side who had arrived that day, began the attack from Millionnaya Street. After a short run, we moved forward slightly, approaching the Winter Palace. The most difficult thing was to cross the square that was blocked by fire. The machine gun fire was so intense that it was simply impossible to cross the square.

At midnight, the cannons of the Peter and Paul Fortress fired. We felt a new force had been added. All of us were full of confidence in the coming victory. … Forward, forward! Now, the “Provisional Government faction” is doomed! …

This was a decisive battle of life and death. Nothing could be seen around, not even buildings or people. Under the searchlights of the cruiser "Aurora" and other warships anchored on the Neva River, the Winter Palace suddenly appeared from the darkness, followed by a pitch-black night.

A tsunami-like roar erupted in the square, with the sounds of people, gunfire, and shells exploding merging together. The revolutionary soldiers advanced towards the Winter Palace from three directions: the parade ground, Millionnaya Street, and Alexander Park. After a while, a high-pitched, victorious "Hurrah!" came from the direction piled with round logs. The cadets were defeated.

The two large iron gates were shaken and slowly opened. We rushed into the Winter Palace with overwhelming force. Here were wide staircases gleaming with white light, tall corridors, rows of chairs, paintings hanging on the walls…

Bullets whistled overhead, from the left and right. The enemies defending the Winter Palace hid behind the stair railings, shooting at us from behind columns and chairs. In the battle to eliminate the cadets, room-to-room close combat was necessary. It was by no means easy to capture the Winter Palace with over a thousand rooms.

The battle inside the Winter Palace lasted for almost an hour and a half.

Our final goal was the place where the ministers of the Provisional Government were hiding. A line of cadets with guns stood ready to fire at the door.

The Red Guards and soldiers snatched the guns from their hands and went into the room... The personnel of the Provisional Government were arrested and imprisoned in the Peter and Paul Fortress.

October 25, 1917 (November 7, Gregorian calendar), this glorious day, has been recorded in the history of our motherland and mankind as the day of the victory of the Great October Socialist Revolution. (Special contribution to this newspaper, translated by Feng)

    攻打冬宫
    ——作家巴维尔·阿尔斯基的回忆
    编者按　巴维尔·阿尔斯基是一个砖瓦工的儿子，他本人在过去曾经作过砖瓦工、锅炉工、水手和矿工。1905年他在波尔塔瓦参加革命。1915年他被征入沙皇军队，在巴甫洛夫近卫团里当一名士兵。1917年2月战士们选他做团的士兵委员会副主席。
    巴维尔·阿尔斯基所在的巴甫洛夫团，参加了攻打冬宫之役，曾为十月社会主义革命的胜利而战。1917年俄国的革命运动日益波澜壮阔。在这种情况下，共产党着手准备武装起义。根据党中央10月12日（公历25日）的指示，在彼得格勒苏维埃成立了革命军事委员会，这是准备和实行武装起义的战斗机关。革命军事委员会的领导核心是党中央委员会在10月16日举行的扩大会议上所选出的党的中央。
    10月24日（公历11月6日）赤卫军的总部，接到了革命军事委员会关于动员一切力量进行战斗准备的命令。就在这一天，列宁来到了斯莫尔尼宫，并且直接掌握对起义的领导。
    ……这一个夜晚是我终生难忘的。资产阶级临时政府盘踞的冬宫，从四面八方被包围起来。冷空气中不时传出赤卫队、士兵和水兵们的声音。他们的大衣被雨雪淋湿了。在彼得堡的练兵场上，燃起了一堆堆的营火，战士们在那里烤手。
    我们的巴甫洛夫团已做好战斗准备。战士们的心情十分焦急，但是我们要等革命军事委员会的指示行动。
    为了避免流血，革命军事委员会向临时政府提出了最后通牒，要他们在二十分钟以内投降。
    指定的时间到了。就在这最后的时刻，我们接到了临时政府的答复。他们要求再延长十分钟。革命军事委员会同意这样做。大家都在看着表。又等到时间了，冬宫里仍然默不作声。事情很明显了，这是临时政府在玩弄诡计，欺骗起义群众，极力想赢得时间。它仍然期望随时都会有从前线开来的援军。
    革命军事委员会命令：攻打冬宫开始。
    攻击的信号是我们所有的战士和革命部队的指挥员全都熟悉的：一看到彼得罗巴甫洛夫堡上空烧起红色信号灯，“阿芙乐尔”巡洋舰就马上开炮。紧张气氛已达到了顶点。快下手吧！……
    在堡垒的尖塔上面的高空，升起一颗红星。这时是二十一点四十分。“阿芙乐尔”巡洋舰的大炮打响了。赤卫队、士兵和水兵们，勇敢、坚决、齐心协力地开始战斗。人们的呐喊声同机关枪的射击声、子弹的呼啸声交织在一起。此起彼伏连续不断的射击，划破了夜幕。
    巴甫洛夫团和白天开到我们这里来的彼得格勒方面的赤卫队一道，从百万大街开始攻击。经过短时间的跑步，我们稍许向前移动，逼近冬宫。最困难的是要穿过被火力封锁的广场。机关枪的火力很猛，以致简直无法穿过这个广场。
    午夜十二点，彼得罗巴甫洛夫堡的大炮打响了。我们感到又增加了一股新的力量。我们所有的人对即将到来的胜利都充满信心。……前进呀，前进！现在，“临时政府派”就要完蛋了！……
    这是生死存亡的决定性的战斗。周围什么也看不见，就连楼房和人也分辨不出来。在停泊在湼瓦河上的“阿芙乐尔”巡洋舰和其它战斗舰的探照灯照耀下，冬宫突然从黑暗中现出原形，之后又是一片漆黑的夜。
    广场上发出了海啸一般的轰鸣，人声、射击声和炮弹爆炸声汇合在一起。革命的士兵，从练兵场、百万大街和亚历山大公园这三个方面向冬宫挺进。又过了一会儿，从堆满圆木的方面发出高吭的胜利的“乌拉！”声。士官生被击溃了。
    两扇大铁门被撼动了，缓缓地敞开来。我们以排山倒海之势冲进了冬宫。这里有泛着白光的宽大楼梯，高大的走廊，一排排的椅子，墙上挂着画……
    子弹从头上，从左边和右边呼啸而过。守冬宫的敌人藏在楼梯栏杆后面，他们从圆柱和椅子的后面向我们射击。战斗中为了肃清士官生，要逐室地进行白刃战。打下拥有一千多个房间的冬宫，决非容易之事。
    在冬宫内部进行的战斗，几乎达一个半钟头之久。
    我们最后的目标是临时政府部长们隐藏的地方。门口有持枪的士官生队伍准备开枪。
    赤卫队和士兵们从他们手里夺下了枪枝，走进房间里去了……临时政府的人员被逮捕，并被关进彼得罗巴甫洛夫堡。
    1917年10月25日（公历11月7日）这个光荣的日子，作为伟大十月社会主义革命胜利之日载入了我们祖国和人类的史册。（本报特约稿峰译）（附图片）
