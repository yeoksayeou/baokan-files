    Thanks to the Soviet Union for its Sincere Help
    Feng Chao, Director of Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Factory

    The Chinese people remember very clearly that for more than thirty years, our revolutionary cause has been hated and sabotaged by all imperialist countries. However, the Soviet Union always extended a hand of friendship to help us in the most difficult days. On the second day of the founding of New China, the Soviet Union was the first country in the world to announce the establishment of diplomatic relations with our country. In February 1950, China and the Soviet Union signed the "Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance." With this alliance, world peace has a reliable guarantee.

    The Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Factory is one of the 156 projects aided by the Soviet Union in China's construction. The factory's complete set of equipment was supplied by the Soviet Union. From surveying and designing to construction and installation, from small-batch trial production to mass production, everything is inseparable from the enthusiastic help of Soviet comrades. During this period, the Soviet government sent 35 of its best experts to directly participate in our factory's construction work. Comrades such as Kaldelin, Chief Engineer of the State Operation Design and Trial Institute of the Soviet Machine Tool Manufacturing Department, and Kasovich, Engineer of the Moscow Tool Factory, all possessed high technical theories and practical work experience. With a great spirit of internationalism, they enthusiastically and unreservedly taught Soviet advanced science and technology and production experience to our workers, laying a good foundation for China's tool manufacturing industry.

    During the construction of the Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Factory, due to the cold weather and long winter in the Harbin area, if construction were carried out according to natural conditions, the factory's construction would be prolonged by one year. However, under the guidance and advice of Soviet experts Ivaki and Dadalinzev, winter construction was carried out on the factory's measuring tool workshop, factory office building, and central water tower. Ivaki braved the severe cold of minus 30 degrees Celsius to work outdoors with the workers and personally taught Chinese workers how to carry out winter construction. This not only allowed the factory's construction and installation project to be completed ahead of schedule, but also set a good example for Harbin, this emerging industrial base, and cultivated a technical team with modern construction standards for the First Engineering Company of Northeast China's construction industry.

    In the past, China was mostly unable to produce measuring tools and cutting tools by itself, and the measuring tools and cutting tools required by the machinery industry were almost entirely imported from foreign countries. For example, "gauge blocks," which require extremely high precision, require a dimensional accuracy that cannot differ by 0.7/100,000 of a millimeter. Not to mention the production of these benchmark measuring tools, even the new technologies and equipment used in the design had never been seen in our country. However, with the help of the Soviet government and under the personal guidance of Soviet experts, our factory trained a large number of technical workers in more than ten special types of work, such as machine tool adjustment, optical curve grinding, and chrome plating. A total of thirteen professional training courses were opened, training 488 workers and 108 technicians.

    On January 18, 1955, the Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Factory was officially accepted by the state and put into production. In June 1956, the factory's total output value had reached the production level stipulated in the state's Five-Year Plan for 1957, and it reached the design level 18 months ahead of schedule. In addition to learning and mastering the manufacturing technology of 80 basic varieties and more than 6,000 specifications of measuring tools and cutting tools, we are also gradually trial-producing new products. This year, we plan to trial-produce eleven new products, such as dial comparators, 0.002 dial indicators, and screw micrometers.

    The birth and development of the Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Factory are inseparable from the Soviet Union's help to our country. All the workers and staff of our factory are constantly grateful for the Soviet government's selfless assistance to us. Chairman Mao pointed out this truth more than a decade ago: The liberation cause of the Chinese nation and the Chinese people can only be truly assisted by socialist countries; and our cause cannot achieve final victory without their assistance.

    The 40th anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution is coming soon. We sincerely extend our gratitude to the great Soviet Communist Party, the Soviet government, and the Soviet people.

    We must resolutely learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union to build our motherland.

    Let us shout:

    Long live the 40th anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution!

    Long live Marxism-Leninism!

    Long live the Soviet people!

### 感谢苏联的真诚帮助

    感谢苏联的真诚帮助
    哈尔滨量具刃具厂厂长　冯超
    中国人民记得清清楚楚，三十几年里，我们的革命事业受到一切帝国主义国家的仇视和破坏，但是，苏联总是在最困难的日子里，伸出友谊的手，来帮助我们。在新中国成立的第二天，世界上第一个宣布和我国建立外交关系的，就是苏联。在1950年2月，中苏两国又订立了“中苏友好同盟互助条约”，有了这个同盟，世界和平就有了可靠的保证。
    哈尔滨量具刃具厂就是苏联帮助我国建设一百五十六项工程之一，工厂的全套设备都是苏联供给的，这个厂从勘测设计到施工安装，从小批试制到成批生产，全与苏联同志们的热情帮助分不开。这期间苏联政府派来了三十五位最优秀的专家直接参加我们的建厂工作。像苏联机床制造部国家操作设计试制院的总工程师卡尔德林、莫斯科工具厂工程师卡索维奇等同志，都具有很高的技术理论与实际工作经验，他们以伟大的国际主义精神，将苏联的先进科学技术和生产经验，热情地毫不保留地教给了我们的工人，为我国的工具制造工业打下了良好的基础。
    哈尔滨量具刃具厂在建厂过程中，由于哈尔滨地区寒冷，冬季时间较长，如果根据自然条件施工，那么便会使建厂工作拖长一年，但在苏联专家依瓦基、达达林则夫二位同志的建议指导下，工厂的量具厂房、厂部办公楼和中央水塔进行了冬季施工。依瓦基冒着零下三十度的严寒，在室外和工人一起劳动，亲自教导中国工人进行冬季施工，这不仅使工厂建筑安装工程提前完成，并给哈尔滨市这个新兴的工业基地，树立了良好的榜样，给我国东北建筑第一工程公司培养出一支具有现代建筑水平的技术队伍。
    量具、刃具过去在我国大部分不能自造，机械工业中所需用的量具刃具几乎完全靠外国进口。如精密度要求极高的“块规”，它的尺寸精确度，要求不能差十万分之七公厘。不要说这些基准量具的生产了，就是连设计所采用的新工艺和设备我国也从没见过，但是我们在苏联政府的帮助下，在苏联专家的亲手指导下，给我厂培养了大批的机床调整光学曲线磨、镀铬等十多种特殊工种的技术工人，共开了十三个专业训练班，培训了工人四百八十八名，技术人员一百零八人。
    1955年1月18日哈尔滨量具刃具厂正式经国家验收开工生产，1956年6月，工厂总产值已达国家五年计划规定的1957年的生产水平，并提前十八个月达到了设计水平。我们现在除了学会掌握八十个基本品种六千多种规格的量具刃具制造技术外，还逐步的在试制新产品，今年计划试制十一种新产品。如千分比较仪0．002千分表，螺丝千分尺等。
    哈尔滨量具刃具厂的诞生与发展，和苏联对我国的帮助是分不开的。我们全厂职工，无时无刻的都在感激苏联政府对我们的大公无私的援助，毛主席早在十几年前就指出这个真理：中华民族和中国人民的解放事业，只有社会主义的国家，才能真正援助；而我们的事业没有他们的援助是不能取得最后胜利的。
    伟大的十月社会主义革命四十周年就要到了，我们衷心地向伟大的苏联共产党，苏联政府和苏联人民致以谢意。
    我们要坚决学习苏联的先进经验，来建设我们的祖国。
    让我们高呼：
    伟大的十月社会主义革命四十周年万岁！
    马克思列宁主义万岁！
    苏联人民万岁！（附图片）
