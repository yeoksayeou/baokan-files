    Dialogue Between Two Artificial Satellites
    Guo Moruo
    (One): Dear comrade, you've finally arrived.
      I've been waiting for a month, you've finally arrived.
      Your size is bigger than mine, you fly higher than me.
    (Two): You are the vanguard, you flew the earliest.
      I saw you fly into the vacuum,
      I was worried you'd be a little lonely.
    (One): We are a gift for the October Revolution,
      Good things come in pairs, your arrival makes me even stronger;
      I believe there are more comrades preparing to fly.
    (Two): Yes, dear comrade, you are right,
      Soon there will be more comrades flying,
      They will fly higher and faster than us.
    (One): Yes, they will fly to the moon,
      And send humans there to settle down and take root,
      I think it won't be too long before that happens.
    (Two): Do you know, I also brought a dog?
      His name is Laika, he is living very normally,
      Not agitated at all, not howling.
    (One): Laika, my little friend, is worth praising,
      He flew into the sky for the first time ever,
      I think he is a true hero.
    (Two): Yes, he is a heroic image,
      Selflessly serving the happiness of mankind,
      But he doesn't mind himself, and he's not exaggerating.
    (One): I heard that some animal protection societies in some countries
      Think he is being cruelly abused,
      And want to protest on his behalf, it's really strange.
    (Two): The hearts of those kind people can't be said to be bad,
      But they are eating turkey, calves, and little birds.
      The psychology of protecting dogs is nothing more than protecting treasure.
    (One): The dog has been relieved of the duty of guarding treasure,
      He's reached the pinnacle of vacuum travel,
      Laika won't be grateful to those kind people.
    (Two): Yes, people are really strange.
      Some people created the Earth satellite,
      Some people are brewing war.
    (One): The strangest thing is those kind people,
      They don't protest the conspiracies of war,
      But they want to protest the dog's flight.
    (Two): Please let them get the comfort of "conscience",
      They are always kinder than the warmongers,
      I hope they enlighten the brilliance of reason.
    (One): Oh, we must not forget our companions,
      And the three-stage rockets that sent us into the sky,
      They are also orbiting the Earth.
    (Two): Yes, they are the messengers of peace,
      Without them, we wouldn't be able to fly into the sky;
      They will make the conspiracies of war vanish like smoke.
    (One): Comrade, it's a pity the meeting time is too short,
      There are really too many things I can't say.
      Wish you peace, we'll see you again.
    (Two): Wish you peace, we'll see you again,
      But today please let us shout in unison:
    (One): (Two): (Together) "Long live the great 40th anniversary of the October Revolution!"
                  November 7, 1957, in Moscow

    两个人造卫星的对话
    郭沫若（一）：亲爱的同志，你终于来了。
      我等了一个月，你终于来了。
      你的身材比我大，飞得比我高。（二）：你是急先锋，你飞得最早。
      我看到你飞进了真空，
      我是耽心你会有些寂寥。（一）：我们是十月革命的献礼，
      好事要成双，你来我就更有力量；
      我相信还有好些同志在准备飞翔。（二）：是的，亲爱的同志，你说得很对，
      接着便会有好些同志要飞来，
      他们会飞得比我们更高，更快。（一）：是啦，他们将会飞到月球去，
      把人类送到那儿落户生根，
      我看，这不会是太久的事情。（二）：你知道吗，我还带着了一条狗？
      他名叫莱伊卡，生活得很正常，
      丝毫也不急躁，没有乱吼。（一）：莱伊卡小友倒是很值得歌颂，
      他破天荒地飞上了天空，
      我看他倒是位真正的英雄。（二）：是的，他真是一个英雄形象，
      献身地在为人类幸福服务，
      自己却毫不介意，毫不夸张。（一）：我听说有哪一国的爱护动物会，
      认为他是受了残酷的虐待，
      要为他提出抗议，真是奇怪。（二）：那些善人们的心肠不能说不好，
      不过他们却在吃火鸡、小牛和小鸟。
      爱护狗的心理不外是爱护宝财。（一）：狗被解除了守财奴的职份，
      登峰造极地做到真空旅行，
      莱伊卡不会向那些善人们感恩。（二）：是的，人实在也是奇怪。
      有的人创造了地球卫星，
      有的人却在酝酿着战争。（一）：最奇怪的就是那些善人，
      他们不抗议战争的阴谋，
      而却要抗议狗的飞行。（二）：请让他们得到“良心”的安慰，
      他们总比战争贩子们善良，
      希望他们启发理智的辉光。（一）：哦，我们可不要忘记我们的同伴，
      还有把我们送上天来的三级火箭，
      他们也在环绕着地球旋转。（二）：是的，他们才是和平的使者，
      没有他们，我们飞不上天；
      他们会使战争的阴谋烟消云散。（一）：同志，可惜相会的时刻太短，
      心里的话实在是无法说完。
      祝你平安，我们回头再见。（二）：祝你平安，我们回头再见，
      但在今天请让我们同声高呼：
        “万岁，伟大十月革命四十周年！”（一）：（二）：（合）“万岁，伟大的十月革命四十周年！”
                  1957年11月7日，于莫斯科
