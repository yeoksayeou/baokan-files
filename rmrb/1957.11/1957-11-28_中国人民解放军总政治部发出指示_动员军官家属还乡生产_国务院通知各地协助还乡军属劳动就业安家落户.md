Xinhua News Agency, November 27th: The General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army issued a directive to the entire army on the 21st regarding mobilizing officers' families to return to the countryside for production and participate in socialist construction.

The directive stated that since the implementation of the salary system in our army, the number of dependents accompanying military personnel has increased rapidly. A large number of dependents residing with the military has not only created significant difficulties in terms of housing, medical treatment, children's schooling, family employment, and material supplies, but also often affects the training and combat readiness of the troops, as well as the work, study, and progress of officers. In particular, at a time when a high tide of socialist production is sweeping the country's rural areas, the phenomenon of officers' families moving from the countryside to the cities and shifting from production to non-productive activities is a highly abnormal reversal that inevitably affects rural production, the relationship between officers and soldiers, and military-civilian relations to some extent.

The directive stated that mobilizing officers' families to return to the countryside for production, labor employment, resettlement, and participation in socialist construction is in line with the overall interests of both army building and national construction, as well as the personal interests of the officers. The return of dependents to the countryside for production is conducive to strengthening the army, fostering closer relations between officers and soldiers and between the military and the people, promoting the work, study, and progress of the officers themselves, facilitating labor employment and increased income for the dependents, reducing expenses, and benefiting the upbringing, training, and education of officers' children. According to statistics, 80% of the dependents accompanying military personnel are rural working women with relatively high political awareness, production experience, and work habits. As long as we mobilize and organize them to return to the countryside for production, they will immediately become creators of social wealth. This politically significant and glorious action will play an active role in increasing agricultural production, promoting socialist construction, and establishing a socialist ethos of building the army and managing households diligently and frugally, loving labor, and practicing thrift.

The directive stated that the army is the armed force of the state, a combat organization, and in principle, the dependents of all members should not reside with the military. Currently, the vast majority of officers' wives, children, and all officers' parents, siblings, and non-direct relatives who are already residing with the military should be mobilized to return to the countryside for production and resettlement. In principle, dependents who joined the military before October 1, 1949, dependents with job positions, and the families of junior officers who joined the army during the Red Army era and have no home to return to may be temporarily allowed to stay with the military. Those without jobs who are willing and able to return to the countryside for production should also be mobilized to do so as much as possible. For all dependents approved to stay with the military temporarily, in principle, officers themselves should be responsible for their housing, medical treatment, children's schooling, and childcare, but they should also be organized to participate in nearby agricultural, handicraft production cooperatives, or military reclamation farms for production. Officers should also be encouraged to build or rent houses themselves to settle down, so that their families gradually leave the barracks. Dependents with many children, poor health, and unable to participate in production labor should be mobilized to take good care of household affairs. After officers' families return to the countryside, officers may be allowed to visit their families once a year during their vacations. The families of salaried staff serving in the army will also be treated according to the above principles.

The directive requires Party committees and political organs at all levels throughout the army to adopt the mass line method, vigorously, step by step, and in batches, to conduct thorough and full ideological and organizational work among all officers and their families, and strive to mobilize the majority of dependents who should return to the countryside to do so around the Spring Festival next year.

Xinhua News Agency, November 27th: The State Council issued a notice on the 23rd regarding assisting officers' families to return to the countryside for production and labor employment. The full text is as follows:

Recently, the Chinese People's Liberation Army has begun to mobilize officers' families accompanying military personnel to return to the countryside for production, labor employment, resettlement, and participation in socialist construction in stages and batches. This measure is not only conducive to strengthening army building and fostering closer military-civilian relations, but also the return of a large number of officers' families from cities to rural areas, from consumption to production, has a significant role in increasing agricultural production and promoting socialist construction. However, since officers' families have been away from the countryside and separated from production for a long time, it is estimated that they will encounter some temporary difficulties in resettlement or employment, and the people's committees of each province, autonomous region, and municipality directly under the Central Government need to supervise the relevant county (city) and township people's committees to actively find ways to provide assistance and do the following:

1.  After officers' families return to the countryside, the local government should actively arrange for them to participate in agricultural production. For officers' families who have previously worked in township or commune people's organizations, if they are still able to work, they should be absorbed into work as much as possible.
2.  Some officers' families have no home to return to or are far from home and are willing to participate in labor production near the military garrison. The local government should find ways to arrange for them to join nearby agricultural production cooperatives or handicraft production cooperatives, or assist the army in establishing farms to organize them for production.
3.  When officers' families return to the countryside for production and resettlement, if they have no housing or the housing is not enough, the local government should find ways to mobilize the masses to lend or rent houses to them. When it is necessary to repair or build new houses, the masses should also be mobilized to provide assistance.
4.  After officers' families return to the countryside, daily necessities such as tables, benches, beds, pots, bowls, spoons, and basins may not be purchased immediately. The masses can be mobilized to lend them for temporary use, but the families should return them to the original owners in a timely manner after use, and the families should be responsible for compensation if there is any damage.
5.  Officers' families who participate in agricultural production may be allocated the same amount of private plots as other members, according to the specific circumstances of the local agricultural production cooperative, to solve their difficulties in growing their own vegetables.
6.  The local government should assist in solving the problem of school enrollment and transfer for officers' children after they return to the countryside, and try to prevent them from dropping out of school due to returning to the countryside.
7.  Mobilize and educate grassroots cadres, commune members, and the masses to welcome officers' families who return to the countryside for production and employment, and actively unite them. After a certain period of training, they should gradually change their habits and become one with the masses in production and life.

The people's committees of counties (cities) and townships in various places should regard the above items as a political task of supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of revolutionary armymen and martyrs, earnestly study them, and earnestly implement them.

### 中国人民解放军总政治部发出指示  动员军官家属还乡生产  国务院通知各地协助还乡军属劳动就业安家落户

    中国人民解放军总政治部发出指示
    动员军官家属还乡生产
    国务院通知各地协助还乡军属劳动就业安家落户
    新华社27日讯　中国人民解放军总政治部21日向全军发出关于动员军官家属还乡生产、参加社会主义建设的指示。
    指示说，自从我军实行薪金制以来，随军家属的数目增长很快。大批的家属随军居住，不但住房、治病、子女入学、家属就业、物质供应等方面发生了很大的困难，而且常常影响部队的训练和作战，影响军官的工作、学习和进步；特别是正当全国农村掀起社会主义生产高潮的时候，军官家属反而从农村转入城市，由生产转入脱产，这种极不正常的倒流现象，在一定程度上必然影响农村生产，影响官兵关系和军民关系。
    指示说，动员军官家属还乡生产、劳动就业、安家落户、参加社会主义建设，既符合军队建设和国家建设的整体利益，也符合军官的个人利益。随军家属还乡生产，有利于军队建设和密切官兵关系与军民关系，有利于军官本人的工作、学习和进步，有利于家属劳动就业、增加收入、减少开支，有利于军官子女的培养、锻炼和教育。据统计，随军家属有80％是农村劳动妇女，她们政治觉悟较高，有生产经验和劳动习惯，只要我们动员和组织她们还乡生产，她们就会立即变成社会财富的创造者。这一富有政治意义的光荣行动，对于增加农业生产，促进社会主义建设，树立勤俭建军、勤俭持家、热爱劳动、厉行节约的社会主义风气，必将起着积极的作用。
    指示说，军队是国家的武装力量，是一个战斗组织，一切成员的家属原则上都不能随军居住。目前，应该动员已经随军的绝大部分军官的妻子、儿女和所有军官的父母、弟妹及非直系亲属还乡生产，安家落户。其中，1949年10月1日以前随军的家属、有工作岗位的家属和红军时代入伍无家可归的尉官家属，原则上可以允许暂时随军。其中没有工作的、愿意和能够还乡生产的，也应尽量动员他们还乡生产。对所有批准暂时随军的家属，除住房、治病、子女入学入托等，原则上由军官本人自理外，也应组织她们参加就近的农业、手工业生产合作社或军垦农场进行生产，并提倡军官自建或自租房舍定居，使家属逐渐离开营房。子女多、身体弱、不能参加生产劳动的家属，应动员她们好好料理家务。军官家属还乡后，可准许军官每年在休假期间探家一次。在部队服务的工薪制职员的家属，也按上述原则处理。
    指示要求全军各级党委和政治机关采用群众路线的办法，大张旗鼓地、有步骤地、分期分批地向全体军官和家属进行深入的充分的思想工作和组织工作，争取在明年春节前后，将应该还乡的家属大部动员还乡。
    新华社27日讯　国务院23日发出关于协助军官家属还乡生产劳动就业的通知，全文如下：
    中国人民解放军最近已经开始分期、分批地动员随军军官家属，还乡生产，劳动就业，安家落户，参加社会主义建设。这一措施，不仅有利于加强军队建设和密切军民关系，而且大批军官家属由城市返回农村，由消费走向生产，对增加农业生产，促进社会主义建设，也有重大作用，但是，由于军官家属离开农村、脱离生产时间较久，估计她们还乡安家或者生产就业，暂时都会遇到一些困难，需要各省、自治区、直辖市人民委员会督导有关的县（市）、乡人民委员会积极设法予以协助，做好以下几项工作：
    一、军官家属还乡以后，当地政府应该积极地安排她们参加农业生产；对过去曾经在乡、社人民团体担任过工作的军官家属，如现在仍有参加工作条件的时候，应该尽可能地吸收她们参加工作。
    二、有些军官家属因无家可归，或者离家较远，愿意在部队驻地附近参加劳动生产的，当地政府应该设法安置她们加入就近的农业生产合作社或者手工业生产合作社，或者协助军队开办农场，组织她们进行生产。
    三、军官家属还乡生产，安家落户的时候，没有房舍或者房舍不够住的，当地政府应该设法动员群众借给，或者租给她们居住；需要修理或者新盖房舍的时候，亦应该动员群众予以协助。
    四、军官家属还乡以后，日常生活的必需用具，如桌、凳、床铺、锅、碗、瓢、盆等，一时购置不及，可以动员群众借给她们暂时使用，但是家属用后应该及时归还原主，如有损坏，应该由家属负责赔偿。
    五、军官家属参加农业生产的，可以按照当地农业生产合作社的具体情况，分给她们与其他社员以同等数量的自留地，以解决她们自种蔬菜的困难。
    六、军官子女还乡以后的入学、转学问题，当地政府应该协助解决，尽量设法使他们不因还乡而发生失学、辍学的现象。
    七、动员和教育基层干部、社员群众，对军官家属还乡生产，劳动就业，应该抱欢迎态度，并且积极主动地团结她们，经过一定时期的锻炼，使她们逐步改变习惯，在生产和生活上同群众打成一片。
    以上各项，各地县（市）、乡人民委员会应该当做一项拥军优属的政治任务，认真研究，切实执行。
      一九五七年十一月二十三日
