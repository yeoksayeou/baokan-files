    "The Department Head is Here!"
    When Xue Huitang was participating in sports activities, he accidentally injured his left foot. He couldn't put weight on it, so his classmates brought him food when it was time to eat; his classmates carried him to class; and his classmates supported him when he went to the toilet. ...
    The next afternoon, several of us students were reading when the department head and another responsible comrade from the department suddenly came into the dormitory. They carefully inquired about Xue Huitang's condition, repeatedly urging him to take good care of himself and rest peacefully. Finally, they also instructed us to take extra care of the patient. We said, "Director, don't worry, we will take good care of him." The department head also asked about our studies, what requests we had, and what opinions we had on teaching.
    The department head stayed with us for half an hour. After he left, some students said, "Look, the department head's work style is changing!"

    “系主任来了！”
    薛惠堂参加体育活动时，不小心把左脚弄坏了。脚不能着地，吃饭时同学们给端来；上课时同学们背着他；到厕所时同学们扶着。……
    第二天下午，我们几个同学正在看书，系主任和系的另一位负责同志突然走进宿舍来。他们仔细地询问了薛惠堂的病情，一再叮嘱要好好地注意，安心地休养。最后，还嘱咐我们要格外地照顾病人。我们说：“主任放心，我们一定会好好地照顾的。”系主任又问到我们的学习情况，问我们有什么要求和对教学上有什么意见。
    系主任在我们这里呆了半个多小时，他走后，有的同学说：“你瞧，系主任的工作作风在改变了啊！”
