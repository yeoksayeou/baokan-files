Xinhua News Agency, November 2nd: Japan's 27th Extraordinary Diet session opened this afternoon. This is the first Diet session convened since the formation of the Nobusuke Kishi Cabinet.

Nobusuke Kishi delivered a policy speech at the Extraordinary Diet session. Kishi, who has been trying to promote the so-called "Southeast Asia Development Plan," once again stated, when discussing Japan's relations with Asian countries, that Asian countries should engage in economic and cultural cooperation. However, on the issue of Japan's diplomatic relations, he emphasized that Japan should establish a "solid and lasting cooperative relationship" with the United States.

Inejiro Asanuma, Secretary-General of the Japan Socialist Party, questioned Nobusuke Kishi's policy direction on behalf of the Socialist Party. Asanuma first pointed out that Kishi's policy speech was "too abstract." The Japan-U.S. Joint Communiqué issued by Kishi and Eisenhower "only deepened Japan's dependence on the United States." He pointed out that cooperation with the Asian-African group is the path that contributes to world peace; Kishi's "Southeast Asia Development Plan" is unpopular among Asian countries because it relies on "U.S. aid."

Asanuma said that it is now time to restore diplomatic relations between Japan and China. He also pointed out that Japan should propose an immediate and unconditional ban on nuclear weapons testing. Regarding economic policy, Asanuma said that the Kishi Cabinet's deflationary policy is a policy that sacrifices the people's lives.

Asanuma criticized the Kishi Cabinet for delaying the convening of this Diet session and demanded that the Diet be dissolved and a general election be held in January next year.

Sanzo Nosaka, First Secretary of the Japanese Communist Party, published a statement in the "Akahata" newspaper criticizing the policy speech delivered by Nobusuke Kishi at the Extraordinary Diet session.

Nosaka said that Kishi, in his policy speech, failed to offer any concrete results on issues such as the prohibition of nuclear weapons testing, the negotiation of Japan-China trade, and cooperation with Southeast Asian countries, all of which the Japanese people are demanding. This diplomatic failure is a major blow to Kishi.

Nosaka said: We want to make the following three demands to this Extraordinary Diet session: First, the government must clearly announce and implement its policy on the unconditional cessation of atomic and hydrogen bomb tests; second, it must clearly express its attitude towards the Taiwan regime and decide to adopt a policy of promoting genuine friendly relations between Japan and China and promoting the restoration of diplomatic relations between the two countries; third, immediately dissolve the Diet and accept the judgment of the people in order to fundamentally change Japan's politics and move it in the direction of peaceful coexistence, democracy, and improving the people's lives.

    日国会临时会议开幕
    社会党要求解散国会举行大选
    野坂参三抨击岸信介施政演说
    本报综合报道　据新华社2日讯：日本第二十七次国会临时会议今天下午开幕。这是岸信介内阁成立以后召开的第一次国会会议。
    岸信介在国会临时会议上发表了施政演说。一直在设法推销所谓“东南亚开发计划”的岸信介在谈到日本同亚洲各国的关系时，再一次说亚洲各国应当实行经济合作和文化合作。但是，在日本的外交关系问题上，他强调日本应该同美国建立“巩固而持久的合作关系”。
    日本社会党书记长浅沼稻次郎代表社会党对岸信介的施政方针提出质询。浅沼首先指出，岸信介的施政演说“过于抽象”。岸信介同艾森豪威尔发表的日美联合公报“只是加深了日本对美国的从属性”。他指出，同亚非集团合作才是对世界和平有贡献的道路；岸信介的“东南亚开发计划”因为要依靠“美援”，所以不受亚洲国家的欢迎。
    浅沼说，现在已经是恢复日中邦交的时候了。他并且指出日本应该提出立即无条件禁止核武器试验的提案。关于经济政策，浅沼说，岸信介内阁的通货紧缩政策是牺牲国民生活的政策。
    浅沼指责岸信介内阁拖延召开这次国会会议，并且要求在明年1月解散国会，举行大选。
    日本共产党第一书记野坂参三在“赤旗报”上发表谈话，抨击岸信介在国会临时会议上发表的施政演说。
    野坂说，岸信介在他的施政方针演说中对于日本人民所要求的禁止核武器试验、进行日中贸易谈判、同东南亚国家实行合作等问题，都提不出任何具体的成果。这个外交上的失败对岸信介说来是一个极大的打击。
    野坂说：我们要向这次的国会临时会议提出下列三项要求：第一，政府要明确地在关于无条件停止原子弹和氢弹试验问题上宣布自己的方针，并且加以实行；第二，要明确地表示对台湾政权的态度，决定采取增进日中两国真正友好关系并且促使两国恢复邦交的方针；第三，立刻解散国会，接受国民的裁决，以便从根本上改变日本的政治，使它向和平共处、民主和改善国民生活的方向前进。
