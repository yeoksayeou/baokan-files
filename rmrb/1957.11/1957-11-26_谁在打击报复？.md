Zhao Jifu, the director of the office of the National Reserves Committee of the Ministry of Geology, and a Communist Party member, not only failed to welcome and encourage the masses to criticize him as a leading cadre should have done during this "blooming and contending" period, but instead, when the masses put forward well-intentioned criticisms on big-character posters, he wrote big-character posters to counterattack the masses, saying that the masses' criticisms of him were "intentional attacks," were "a matter of political quality," and were "a matter of principle," and demanded that the leading group convene a meeting specifically to discuss this issue. What is even worse is that when the leading comrades criticized him by name at the conference for not suppressing criticism and hindering the "blooming and contending," he actually said that the leadership was "retaliating" against him.

Is suppressing criticism retaliation? Or is criticizing the suppression of criticism retaliation? The issue is very clear. Why does Zhao Jifu want to confuse right and wrong and reverse black and white in this way?

    谁在打击报复？
    地质部全国储量委员会办公室主任、共产党员赵基辅，在这次鸣放中，不仅不像一个领导干部所应该作的那样——欢迎和鼓励群众对自己开展批评，反而当群众在大字报上向他提出善意的批评意见时，写大字报向群众反击，说群众对他的批评是“有意攻击”，是“政治品质问题”，是“大是大非问题”，并要求领导小组召开会议专门讨论这个问题。而且更加恶劣的是当领导同志在大会上指名批评他不应压制批评、阻碍鸣放的时候，他竟说领导上对他“打击报复”。
    究竟压制批评是打击报复？还是对压制批评进行批评是打击报复？问题十分明白，赵基辅为什么要如此混淆是非颠倒黑白？
