    New Raw Materials for Oil, Wine, Soy Sauce, and Vinegar
    Various places in Sichuan have achieved great success in using substitutes to extract oil, brew wine, and make soy sauce.
    The Chongqing No. 1 Silk Textile Factory has used silkworm pupae to make soy sauce. If all the silkworm pupae in this factory were used to make soy sauce, it could save more than 200,000 jin of grain a year. Brewing factories in Pixian County have completely replaced rice with sweet potatoes, potatoes, or pumpkins to make vinegar, and have used medicinal koji instead of sweet koji to make vinegar mash. Based on this year's vinegar production, more than 82,000 jin of staple food can be saved and substituted. Pixian, Wanxian and other places mix sweet potatoes, potatoes or rice bran to make sweet sauce, Qingchuan, Gaoxian and other places use wild water tallow seeds to extract edible oil, and various places in Leshan Prefecture use dried radish to brew wine, all of which have saved a lot of grain.

    油酒酱醋的新原料
    四川各地用代用品榨油、酿酒、做酱油，取得了很好成绩。
    重庆第一丝纺厂用蚕蛹制成了酱油。这个厂全部蚕蛹如果都用来做酱油，一年可节约二十多万斤粮食。郫县各酿造厂完全用红苕、洋芋或南瓜等代替大米做成了醋，又用药曲代替甜曲制醋坯。照今年醋的产量，可以节约和代替主粮八万二千多斤。郫县、万县等地掺用红苕、洋芋或米糠制甜酱，青川、高县等地用野生水冬瓜子榨食油，乐山专区各地用萝卜干酿酒，都节约了不少粮食。　（据新华社讯）
