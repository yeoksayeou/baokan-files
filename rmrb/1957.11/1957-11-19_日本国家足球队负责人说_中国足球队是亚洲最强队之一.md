　　Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, 18th. Mr. Takekoshi, the person in charge of the Japanese national football team that recently visited China, said to a reporter from the Hong Kong "Ta Kung Pao" on his way back to his country that the current Chinese football team is one of the strongest in Asia.
    The Japanese football team officials Takekoshi, Fujita, and coach Takahashi were all very pleased with their visit to China. They said that the six teams they encountered in Beijing, Shanghai, and Shenyang were all excellent football teams. They believe that the "August 1st" team has strong organizational skills in the game, good players' basics, good physique, and agile movements. The Beijing team players are experienced, and several players have particularly good skills.
    Japanese friends also talked about some shortcomings of the Chinese football team. The first is the shooting technique and the problem of grasping the timing. The August 1st team and the Beijing team had many shooting opportunities, but they lacked a powerful kick, so the hit rate was not high. The second is that the level is very high, but the organizational ability is not yet up to par.
    Japanese friends feel that the Chinese audience is very fair, very enthusiastic, and very good at appreciating and understanding football games. They often applaud the Japanese team.

    日本国家足球队负责人说
    中国足球队是亚洲最强队之一
    新华社香港18日电　最近访问中国的日本国家足球队负责人竹腰，在回国途中对香港“大公报”的一位记者说，目前中国的足球队是亚洲最强队之一。
    这个日本足球队的负责人竹腰、藤田和教练高桥都对这次访问中国感到非常愉快。他们说，他们在北京、上海、沈阳遇到的六个队都是优秀的足球队。他们认为“八一”队在比赛中组织力很强，队员基础好、身体好、动作敏捷。北京队的队员经验丰富，有几个队员的技术特别好。
    日本朋友也谈到了中国足球队的一些缺点。第一是射门技术和掌握时机问题，八一队和北京队射门机会很多，但欠缺有力的一脚，所以命中率不高。第二是水平很高，但是组织能力还未到家。
    日本朋友们觉得中国观众很公平，很热情，很懂得欣赏和理解足球比赛，他们常为日本队鼓掌。
