Polish Correspondence:

Lenin Lived Here
By Our Correspondent Hu Sisheng

The old saying goes, "One thinks of loved ones all the more on festive occasions." As we celebrate the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution, everyone recalls the life of Comrade Lenin, the leader of the October Revolution and a loved one of the working people. The Polish people feel this way too. The fact that Comrade Lenin lived and worked on Polish soil for about two years evokes a particularly warm feeling in their memories.

Lenin's Trip to Poland

In 1912, a vigorous wave of workers' strikes swept across Russia, signaling the arrival of a new period of revolutionary upsurge. At that time, Lenin lived in Paris, and the new situation urgently demanded quick decisions and strong leadership. Lenin increasingly felt the inconvenience of being far from Russia. In addition, Comrade Ordzhonikidze, Stalin, and other central leaders who were responsible for practical work in Russia at that time were successively arrested. Therefore, Lenin made the decision to leave Paris. However, if he returned to Russia, the Czarist Russian gendarmerie was waiting for him with handcuffs and instruments of torture. Where to go?

On July 2, 1912, Lenin arrived in Krakow. Krakow is a city in Poland, very close to Russia, and at that time it was under the rule of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Lenin said in a letter to Gorky in August of the same year: "You ask why I came to Austria. The Central Committee has set up a bureau here, very close to the border, which can be used. Newspapers can be received on the third day, and it is convenient to write articles for the newspapers there, and we can work together better." After Lenin came to Krakow, the Foreign Bureau of the Bolshevik Party Central Committee was set up in Lenin's residence.

On September 2, 1912, Lenin moved once, to 47 Lubomirski Street. There were only two rooms here, and the windows, tables, and chairs in the house were often piled with books and newspapers. The small kitchen served as both a dining room and a reception room. A constant stream of newspapers and letters connected Lenin with Russia. The postman delivered letters to Lenin twice a day.

Writing articles for "Pravda" became an important means for Lenin to guide the revolution at that time. Because "Pravda" itself was a powerful weapon for the Bolshevik Party to consolidate its organization and mobilize the masses. Lenin used it to point out the tasks of the struggle at that time to the masses. During his residence in Poland, Lenin wrote a total of 232 articles for "Pravda."

At the same time, Lenin also cared about local affairs. He contacted the Krakow left-wing magazine "Political Prisoner" and made suggestions to the editorial department of the magazine. On April 18, 1913, at the Mickiewicz University in Krakow, Lenin gave a report to the Polish Social Democrats on "The Russian Workers' Movement and Social Democracy."

Of course, it was not just the postman who connected Lenin with the Russian revolutionary movement. Revolutionaries from Russia often came to Lenin's residence in Krakow, and Lenin's residence was often crowded with people. But more importantly, here, under Lenin's personal supervision, two plenary sessions of the Central Committee of the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party were held. At the joint meeting of the Central Committee of the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party and party workers and members of the Social Democratic Party group of the State Duma held from December 28, 1912 to January 1, 1913, Lenin and Stalin jointly formulated measures to improve the editing work of "Pravda."

Moving to the Mountains

At the foot of the Tatar Mountains, nearly 2,000 meters above sea level in southern Poland, there is a quiet and beautiful small mountain village called Poronin. In the spring of 1913, the often leisurely post office in this mountain village suddenly became busy. Every day, a large number of books and letters from many countries were sent through the post office to a stranger who had recently moved here. Soon, the small mountain village spread the word that a Russian revolutionary, Lenin, lived in the Szkrobin's house.

Lenin moved from Krakow to the mountains for health reasons. Long-term intense work, the torment of exile, and the difficult life abroad had adversely affected Lenin's health.

The residents of the mountain village gradually got to know Lenin. Everyone liked to talk to this person with a medium build, a cheerful smile, and a broad forehead. He was kind and polite to people, and could get along with everyone. Lenin often asked the local residents about their living conditions and working conditions, and he did not refuse to sing Russian folk songs with everyone to the accompaniment of the accordion.

Lenin said in a letter from the mountain village to his sister: "I have many newspapers here, so I can work." Indeed, Lenin was still engaged in quite intense labor in this quiet mountain village. Here, Lenin studied the land issue and the national issue. Just before he was arrested here by the Austrian gendarmerie in 1914, he was studying how to turn the imperialist war into a socialist revolution. Here, he held many meetings with Russian and Polish revolutionaries.

In August 1914, Lenin's combat life in the mountain village was interrupted. On August 7, shortly after the outbreak of World War I, the Austrian police suddenly searched Lenin's residence and took away some materials. The next day, he was arrested on the "crime" of being a "Russian spy" and imprisoned in the nearby Nowy Targ prison. In prison, Lenin also wrote a defense for the local Polish peasants who were imprisoned for failing to pay taxes and sent it to the court.

Lenin's arrest aroused protests from people from all walks of life in Poland. Writers, artists, lawyers, and Russian expatriates stood up to defend Lenin. Under such circumstances, after twelve days, on August 19, Lenin regained his freedom. After being released from prison, Lenin needed to leave Poland quickly because the ruling authorities might re-arrest him. On August 29, Lenin left Krakow, that is, left Poland, in a freight car filled with goods. On November 1 of the same year, the Bolshevik Party Central Committee's declaration "War and the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party," signed by Lenin, appeared in the "Social Democrat" newspaper, putting forward the slogan of turning the imperialist war into a civil war. Lenin began a new struggle in a new place.

Lenin Lives in People's Hearts

Now, more than 40 years after Lenin left Poland, under the care of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, the places where Lenin lived in Krakow and Poronin during his lifetime have been turned into museums, and many places have been restored to their original appearance. Every year, people from all over the world come to visit these museums. In the guest books of the museums, you can see the Polish people's respect for this revolutionary teacher.

Reviewing a period of Comrade Lenin's combat life makes people deeply feel that although Comrade Lenin has left us for more than 30 years, his great image still lives in the hearts of the people.

    列宁在这里生活过
    本报记者　胡思升
    古语说：“每逢佳节倍思亲”。在庆祝十月革命四十周年的节日的时候，大家都忆起十月革命的领导人和劳动人民的亲人列宁同志的一生来。波兰人民也是这样。列宁同志在波兰的土地上生活和工作过两年光景的事实，使这里的人们在回忆中带着一种特别亲切的感情。
                列宁同志的波兰之行
    1912年，俄国工人罢工斗争风起云涌，遍及全国，这预示着革命的新的高涨年代来到了。当时，列宁住在巴黎，新的形势迫切需要迅速的决定和有力的领导，列宁愈来愈感到远离俄国的不便。加上当时在俄国负责实际工作的中央领导人奥尔忠尼启则、斯大林等同志相继被捕，列宁于是作了离开巴黎的决定。但是，如果回到俄国，沙皇俄国的宪兵正在用手拷和刑具等着他。往哪里去呢？
    1912年7月2日，列宁从巴黎到达克拉科夫。克拉科夫是波兰的一个城市，离俄国很近，当时是在奥匈帝国的统治下。列宁在同年8月给高尔基的信中曾说：“你问，为什么我到奥国来。中央委员会在这里设立了一个局，离边界很近，可以利用。第三天就可收到报纸，为那里报纸写文章也方便，可以共同工作得更好。”列宁来克拉科夫后，布尔什维克党中央国外局就设置在列宁的住所里。
    1912年9月2日，列宁搬了一次家，搬到鲁布米尔斯基街四十七号。这里只有两间房子，在房子的窗上、桌子上、椅子上经常堆满了书报。小小的厨房兼做餐室和会客室。川流不息的报刊和信件把列宁同俄国联结起来。邮差一天送两次信件给列宁。
    向“真理报”写文章成为列宁当时指导革命的一种重要手段。因为那时的“真理报”本身就是布尔什维克党巩固组织、发动群众的有力武器。列宁就通过它向群众指明当时斗争的任务。在居留波兰期间，列宁一共为“真理报”写了二百三十二篇文章。
    同时，列宁也关心当地的事务，他同克拉科夫的左翼杂志“政治犯”发生接触，向该杂志编辑部提出过建议。1913年4月18日，在克拉科夫的密茨凯维支大学，列宁向波兰的社会民主党人作了“俄国的工人运动和社会民主”的报告。
    把列宁同俄国革命运动联系起来的当然不仅仅是邮差。从俄国经常有革命家到克拉科夫的列宁住所来，在列宁住所里常常挤满了人。但是，更重要的是：在这里，在列宁的亲自主持下举行了俄国社会民主工党中央两次全会。在1912年12月28日到1913年1月1日举行的俄国社会民主工党中央和党的工作人员及国家杜马社会民主党党团成员的联席会议上，列宁和斯大林共同拟定了改进“真理报”编辑工作的措施。
                          移居山间
    在波兰南部海拔近二千公尺的塔塔尔山脚下，有一个僻静的美丽的小山村，叫做博鲁宁。1913年春天，这个山村的经常清闲的邮政站突然忙碌起来了，每天都有大批的来自许多国家的书报信件经过邮政站寄给不久前移住在此的一个陌生人。不久，小山村就传开了，在施柯宾的家里住着一个俄国革命家，就是列宁。
    列宁从克拉科夫移居山间是由于健康的原因。长期紧张的工作，流放的折磨，侨居国外的艰苦生活，都给列宁的健康带来不良的影响。
    山村的居民逐渐都认识了列宁。大家都喜欢同这个有中等身材，开朗的笑脸和宽阔前额的人谈话，他待人和气并有礼貌，同每一个人都能谈得拢。列宁经常向当地居民了解他们的生活情况和劳动条件，他也不拒绝和大家一起在手风琴的伴奏下唱俄国民歌。
    列宁从山村给他的姐姐的信中说：“我这里有许多报纸，可以工作。”的确，列宁在这幽静的山村还从事着相当紧张的劳动。在这里，列宁研究了土地问题和民族问题。就在1914年他在这里被奥地利宪兵逮捕之前，他正在研究怎样把帝国主义大战变成社会主义革命的问题。在这里，他同俄国和波兰的革命者举行了多次会议。
    1914年8月，列宁在山村的战斗生活被打断了。8月7日，第一次世界大战爆发后不久，奥地利警察突然搜查了列宁住所，拿走了一部分材料。第二天，他就以“俄国间谍”的“罪名”被逮捕，被关在不远处的新塔格的监狱中。在监狱中，列宁还代替因为付不起税而被关进来的当地波兰农民写送给法院的辩护词。
    列宁的被捕引起了波兰各界人民的抗议，作家、艺术家、律师、俄国侨民纷纷起来保卫列宁。在这样的形势下，在十二天之后，8月19日，列宁恢复了自由。出狱后，列宁需要赶快离开波兰，因为统治当局可能重新逮捕他。8月29日，列宁坐上塞满货物的货车离开了克拉科夫，也就是离开了波兰。同年11月1日，在“社会民主党人”报上出现了由列宁签名的布尔什维克党中央的宣言：“战争和俄国社会民主工党”，提出了把帝国主义大战变成内战的口号。列宁在新的地方又开始了新的斗争。
                      列宁活在人们心中
    现在，在列宁离开波兰四十多年后的今天，在波兰统一工人党中央的关怀下，列宁生前在克拉科夫和博鲁宁住过的地方都改成了博物馆，许多地方都把它恢复成以前原来的模样。每年都有从全世界各地来的人民到这些博物馆去参观。在博物馆的留言簿里，可以看到波兰人民对这位革命导师崇敬的感情。
    重温列宁同志生前的一段战斗生活，使人深切感到，列宁同志虽然离开我们已三十多年，但是他伟大的形象仍然活在人们的心头。
