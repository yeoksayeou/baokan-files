Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, November 29th. Many veteran teachers in the nine universities in Chongqing are actively participating in the rectification.

Veteran teachers are participating in the rectification work groups in various universities and departments. They have put forward many important opinions on major issues such as teaching work and have personally improved their work. Gu Qiyi, a veteran professor in the Department of Architecture at Chongqing Institute of Architectural Engineering, worked with the teachers to carefully study how to implement the Party's architectural policy in teaching and put forward pertinent opinions. Professor Gu Qiyi stepped forward in the anti-Rightist struggle to oppose the Rightists' attack on the Party and the bourgeois architectural ideas spread by the Rightists. This time, during the rectification, he also regarded running a socialist university well as an inseparable task for himself. Qian Qifan, director of the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Chongqing University, and deputy directors Huang Huirong and Xu Xianggu, carefully studied the reasons for the students' excessive course load. Xu Xianggu also visited teachers and students everywhere for this purpose. They finally proposed a method to streamline the overlapping parts of basic and professional courses. Now, the fourth-year course in the Department of Mechanical Engineering has been reduced from 29 hours per week in the past to 23 hours. Jiang Daojiang, director of the Department of Metallurgy at Chongqing University and a veteran professor, saw that the most opinions from the students of the Department of Metallurgy in the big-character posters were about the poor quality of lectures by the new teachers. In addition to completing his own teaching tasks, he squeezed out time to listen to the new teachers' lectures with the students and talked to them to understand the shortcomings of the new teachers' lectures and the students' requirements. Afterwards, he tried to help the new teachers to improve the quality of their lectures. Many veteran professors also put forward opinions to the Party organization at the symposiums organized by the school Party committee and in the big-character posters to help the Party organization correct its shortcomings.

    办好社会主义大学
    重庆市老教师积极参加整改
    新华社重庆29日电　重庆市九所高等学校中的许多老教师积极参加整改。
    在各高等学校和各系、科的整改工作小组中，都有老教师参加。他们在教学工作等重大问题上提出了许多重要的意见，并且亲自动手改进工作。重庆建筑工程学院建筑系老教授辜其一和教师们一起，仔细研究了如何在教学中贯彻党的建筑方针的问题，提出了中肯的意见。辜其一老教授在反右派斗争中曾挺身而出，反对右派分子的向党进攻，反对右派分子所散播的资产阶级建筑思想。这次在整改中，他又把办好社会主义大学作为与自己不可分割的任务。重庆大学机械系主任钱企范，副主任黄惠荣和许香谷等，细致地研究了学生课程负担过重的原因，许香谷还为此到处访问教师和学生。他们最后提出办法，精简了基础课和专业课重复的部分。现在机械系四年级的课程已经由过去一星期二十九学时，减低到二十三学时。重庆大学冶金系系主任、老教授蒋导江，看到大字报中冶金系学生对新教师讲课质量差的意见最多。他就在完成自己的教学任务以外，挤出时间来和学生一块听新教师讲课，和学生们谈心，从中了解新教师讲课的缺点和学生们的要求，以后就设法帮助新教师，提高他们讲课的质量。许多老教授还在学校党委组织的座谈会上和在大字报中，向党组织提出意见，帮助党组织改正缺点。
