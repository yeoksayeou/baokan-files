Xinhua News Agency, November 5th, Moscow Dispatch: A large number of observation points of various kinds located within the Soviet Union have begun observing the operation of the second artificial satellite. The scientific intelligence obtained from the second satellite is much greater than that obtained from the first satellite. Observation and measurement results are being transmitted using various forms of communication.

The satellite is equipped with instruments to record cosmic rays, which creates conditions that could not be obtained by other methods in the past and guarantees long-term scientific experiments at extremely high altitudes. The satellite's measurement of the intensity of solar radiation energy in the ultraviolet band can study the high-frequency part of the solar spectrum that is largely absorbed in the atmosphere.

These materials will enrich the scientific data on the physical properties of solar radiation and the Earth's energy balance, which are necessary for solving several important problems in geophysics, meteorology, and biophysics.

Measurements illustrating a series of parameters of the hygienic conditions inside the sealed cabin, and recording the main biofunctional indicators of the animal, can provide experimental materials, and studying these materials can clarify the problems of life activities under space flight conditions for the first time.

Currently, preliminary processing of the first batch of data obtained has been carried out.

Xinhua News Agency, November 5th, Moscow Dispatch: According to relevant sources, as of the morning of November 5th, the condition of the small dog "Laika" on the Soviet Union's second artificial satellite was very satisfactory. Its breathing was normal, and the conditions inside the sealed cabin were normal except for a slightly higher temperature.

Before the launch, Soviet scientists prepared many conditions for the dog's flight and conducted thorough research work. In addition to the automatic supply of food and oxygen by instruments, the satellite also carried instruments to record breathing frequency, heart activity, blood pressure, and other materials. All materials were transmitted to Earth via radio.

"Laika" had undergone multiple rocket flights and had undergone rigorous training repeatedly. It was accustomed to living in a tightly sealed room and accustomed to the various instruments around it. It was accustomed to eating a certain amount of food after a certain period of time. Its food on the satellite was specially made. It could be completely unaffected by radiation in the sealed room.

Before the flight, it had a meal in the airport cafeteria, eating two courses and some snacks.

Xinhua News Agency, November 5th, Moscow Dispatch: Professor V. Parin, Academic Secretary of the Soviet Academy of Medical Sciences, told a TASS reporter on the 4th that the fact that we are now able to observe the physiological state of an animal taken to an altitude of 1,500 kilometers by an artificial Earth satellite shows that the Soviet Union has made great achievements in biological experimental technology.

Soviet scientists overcame the many difficulties of animal feeding under conditions of weightlessness and decided to use automatic equipment to provide animals with food on time.

Professor Parin said that the first high-altitude flight of animals in artificial satellites is of great significance in studying the effects of cosmic rays on biological organisms.

Professor Parin concluded by saying that since the dog was domesticated, this animal has served mankind well countless times. In the development of scientific medicine, dogs have been used many times and successfully as experimental subjects, resulting in the solution of many problems of great value to medicine. Undoubtedly, in this remarkable experiment, the dog will once again serve mankind and make invaluable contributions.

Xinhua News Agency, November 5th, Moscow Dispatch: Commenting on the significance of the second artificial satellite, the famous Soviet female astronomer Masevich pointed out that this new satellite, in terms of its weight and distance from the Earth, is already close to the "real" celestial bodies belonging to our planetary system and known in astronomy as "small bodies of the solar system."

She said that the data obtained by scientists from the satellite can illustrate problems in many departments of physics. The satellite is equipped with a special device to study the original composition of cosmic rays. The cosmic rays that can be studied on Earth undergo great changes when they pass through the Earth's atmosphere. It is now possible to study the composition of cosmic rays and the properties of atomic nuclei more deeply and to clarify the origin of cosmic rays, which is now generally inferred to be related to supernova explosions. There is no doubt that valuable data on the distribution of chemical elements in the universe can be obtained, which is also related to the question of their origin.

Masevich pointed out that the device for studying solar radiation in the short-wave band is of particular interest to astronomers and geophysicists. This radiation directly affects the physical state of the high-altitude atmosphere, especially the ionosphere. All these studies will enable us to better understand solar activity and better study the formation of solar radiation, especially the relationship between chromospheric flares and the strengthening of short-wave radiation.

    新卫星佳音频传旅客无恙
    新华社5日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：分布在苏联境内的大量的各种各样的观测点都开始了对第二个人造卫星运行情况的观测。从第二个卫星获得的科学情报要比从第一个卫星上获得的多得多。观察和测量结果正在利用各种通讯形式传送。
    在卫星上装有记录宇宙线的仪器，这就创造了从前用其他方法无法得到的条件，并能保证在极高的高空中进行长时间的科学试验。卫星上对太阳辐射能强度在紫外线带分布情况所进行的测量，可以研究在大气层中被大量吸收的太阳光线光谱的高频部分。
    这些材料将使关于太阳辐射的物理特性的科学资料，地球能量平衡的科学资料丰富起来，这些科学资料是解决地球物理学、气象学、生物物理学等方面若干重要问题所必需的。
    测量说明密封舱内的卫生条件的一系列参数，记录动物的主要生物机能指标，可以提供试验材料，研究这些材料就能第一次阐明在宇宙飞行情况下生命活动的问题。
    现在，对所获得的第一批资料已经进行了初步整理。
    新华社莫斯科5日电　据有关方面获悉，直到5日上午为止，苏联第二个人造卫星上的小狗“莱伊卡”的情况非常令人满意。它的呼吸正常，密封室内除温度略高而外，其他条件都很正常。
    在起飞以前，苏联科学家们为这只小狗的飞行准备了许多条件，作了充分的研究工作。除了由仪器自动供给食物和氧气外，卫星上还带有记录呼吸频率、心脏活动、血压和其他材料的仪器。所有材料都经过无线电传到地球上来。
      “莱伊卡”曾经过多次火箭飞行，并一再经过严格训练。它习惯在封闭严密的室内生活，习惯了周围的各种仪器。它习惯了经过一定时间吃一定份量的食物。它在卫星上的食物是经过特殊制造的。它在密封室里可以完全不受放射线的影响。
    在飞行前，它在机场食堂里进过一次餐，吃了两道菜和一些点心。
    新华社5日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联医学科学院学术秘书瓦·帕林教授4日向塔斯社记者发表谈话时说，我们现在已经有可能观察被人造地球卫星带到一千五百公里高空飞行的动物的生理状态，这个事实说明，苏联的生物实验技术取得了巨大成就。
    苏联科学家克服了动物在失去体重的条件下的饮食问题的重重困难，而决定使用自动装备来按时供给动物饮食。
    帕林教授说，装在人造卫星内的动物第一次高空飞行，在研究宇宙线对生物机体的作用方面有重大意义。
    帕林教授最后说道，自从狗被驯养的时候起，这种动物就曾无数次地很好地为人类服务。在发展科学的医学的过程中，狗就多次地、成功地被利用来作为试验的对象，结果解决了许多对医学非常有价值的问题。无疑地，在这次卓越的试验中，狗将再一次为人类服务并作出不可估价的贡献。
    新华社5日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联著名女天文学家马谢维奇在评论第二个人造卫星意义时指出，这个新卫星就其重量和与地球的距离来说，已经接近属于我们的行星系而在天文学上以“太阳系小天体”著称的“真正的”天体。
    她说，科学家们从卫星上得到的资料可以说明物理学许多部门的问题。卫星上装有一个专门装置，用来研究宇宙线的原始组成。在地球上能够研究的宇宙线，在它们经过地球大气层的时候发生很大变化。现在有可能更深入地研究宇宙线的构成和原子核的性能，弄清楚宇宙线的起源了，现在一般推断，其起源是和超新星爆发有关的。毫无疑问可以获得关于宇宙中化学元素分布的有价值的资料，这也同它们的起源问题有关。
    马谢维奇指出，研究短波波段内的太阳辐射的装置使天文学家和地球物理学家特别感兴趣。这种辐射直接影响着高空大气层，特别是电离层的物理状态。所有这些研究会使我们更好地了解太阳活动，更好地研究太阳辐射的形成，特别是色球爆发同短波辐射加强之间的关系。（附图片）
