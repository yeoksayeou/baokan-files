    Chairman Mao Meets with Students Studying in the Soviet Union
    Since Chairman Mao led our delegation to Moscow, the Chinese students and interns in Moscow have wanted to meet Chairman Mao, see his kind face, and hear his loud voice. In recent days, our embassy in the Soviet Union has been constantly receiving letters and phone calls from them, requesting that their wish be conveyed to Chairman Mao. They all believe that Chairman Mao cares very much about them and will meet them whenever he has a little free time. Their wish has finally come true.
    November 17th, Sunday. Moscow had its first snowfall the day before. The weather that day was very sunny, and the sun came out early. In the morning, while the personnel of Soviet agencies and schools were resting quietly, the Chinese students and interns in Moscow gathered at Moscow University on Lenin Hills to listen to a report on the domestic situation by Comrade Lu Dingyi, a member of our delegation. The students and interns were very happy, and they expected to see Chairman Mao as well.
    There were especially many people who came that day, about three thousand five hundred. The spacious auditorium of Moscow University was full, and a club and a classroom were also occupied. During the report, the students and interns wrote notes to Ambassador Liu Xiao, asking whether Chairman Mao would come, and hoping that Chairman Mao would come. Comrade Lu Dingyi's report did not end until after three o'clock in the afternoon. By this time, everyone knew that Chairman Mao might come, and they were so happy that they kept applauding and cheering, and the whole auditorium was boiling.
    At six o'clock in the afternoon, Chairman Mao and members of the Chinese delegation Deng Xiaoping, Peng Dehuai, Ulanhu, Chen Boda, Yang Shangkun, and Hu Qiaomu, accompanied by Ambassador Liu Xiao, arrived at Moscow University. When Chairman Mao and the delegation members appeared on the platform of the auditorium, everyone in the audience stood up and cheered and applauded, shouting, "Hello, Chairman Mao!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" Chairman Mao walked to the front of the platform, from left to right, waving to everyone. At this time, a wave of hands appeared in the audience, and everyone raised their hands to cheer and pay tribute to Chairman Mao. The storm-like applause and cheers continued for about ten minutes before gradually subsiding.
    Chairman Mao first greeted the students and interns, and then said to them: The world is yours, and ours, but in the final analysis, it is yours. You young people are full of vigor and are in a period of prosperity, like the sun at eight or nine o'clock in the morning. Hopes are pinned on you. Chairman Mao's very witty words aroused laughter and applause from everyone.
    Then, in his speech, Chairman Mao talked to everyone about the current international situation. He first pointed out that the October Socialist Revolution was a turning point in human history. Two man-made satellites went into the sky, and the communist parties of sixty-eight countries came to Moscow to celebrate the October Revolution Day. This is a new turning point. The socialist forces have surpassed the imperialist forces. Our socialist camp must have a head, and that head is the Soviet Union. The enemy also has a head, which is the United States. Without a head, the strength will be weakened. Chairman Mao said that the direction of the world has changed. The struggle between the socialist camp and the capitalist camp is either the West wind prevailing over the East wind, or the East wind prevailing over the West wind. Now there are a total of 2.7 billion people in the world. The population of socialist countries is nearly 1 billion, the population of independent former colonial countries is more than 700 million, the population of countries striving for independence or striving for complete independence and capitalist countries that do not belong to the imperialist camp is 600 million, and the population of the imperialist camp is only about 400 million, and their internal divisions. There will be "earthquakes" there. Now it is not the West wind prevailing over the East wind, but the East wind prevailing over the West wind. When Chairman Mao said this, a storm of applause rang out in the hall.
    Then Chairman Mao talked about the domestic situation. He said: The real and thorough socialist revolution cannot be successful overnight. Some people believe that the victory of the real socialist revolution in our country was in 1956, but I think it was actually in 1957. In 1956, the ownership system was changed, which was relatively easy. In 1957, the victory of the socialist revolution was achieved politically and ideologically. He said that now the rightists have been defeated, but there are still shortcomings in our work. This rectification campaign is a very big thing, and we must earnestly correct it. The world is afraid of the word "earnest," and the Communist Party is the most serious.
    Finally, Chairman Mao once again congratulated everyone and said to everyone that the world belongs to you. The future of China belongs to you.
    Chairman Mao's words dripped like dew into the hearts of the students who were longing for the motherland.
    After Chairman Mao finished speaking, he kindly waved to the enthusiastically applauding people. At this time, a voice came from the corridor of the auditorium: "Chairman Mao, please don't go, sit down and rest."
    Chairman Mao smiled and nodded, looked at everyone kindly, sat down and lit a cigarette and smoked it slowly. At this time, he leaned forward and asked about the lives of the students sitting in the front row.
    Five minutes passed, and Chairman Mao stood up and looked at everyone with loving eyes. The students' faces showed irrepressible joy: Chairman Mao must have seen himself! Chairman Mao finished smoking the cigarette and put the cigarette butt in the ashtray. At this time, the students all knew that Chairman Mao should go to rest, and the emotion of farewell was tightly gripping everyone's heartstrings. In this moment of calm, a clever female student shouted with a half-red face: "Chairman Mao, I wish you good health!" At this time, the venue awoke from silence and cheered one after another. Chairman Mao left his seat, walked to the students, and kindly said to everyone: "Thank you." Then he slowly left the auditorium. Everyone watched Chairman Mao's tall figure, and their eyes revealed a glow of joy.
    Chairman Mao walked to the student club in the backyard, where Chinese students who could not be accommodated in the auditorium were gathered. Chairman Mao greeted them. At this time, hundreds of pairs of eyes looked at Chairman Mao, as if saying at the same time: We could only hear your speech from the microphone just now, now please tell us a few more words! "I will only tell you three sentences," Chairman Mao said with a smile, looking at everyone: "First, young people must be brave and humble; second, I wish you good health, good studies, and good work in the future; third, we must be closely united with Soviet friends."
    Chairman Mao came out of the club and went to the reception room of the Economics Department dormitory of Moscow University to rest. There happened to be four Soviet female students there. An economics student named Chekova said to Chairman Mao in clear Chinese as soon as she saw him: "Hello!" Chairman Mao asked her: "Do you understand Chinese?" She said: "No, I used to live in a room with a Chinese female student and learned a sentence from her." Chairman Mao talked cordially with these Soviet female students for more than twenty minutes. They said: "Your coming here is our great honor." Chairman Mao said: "I am also very honored." They asked Chairman Mao about his impressions of participating in the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution. Chairman Mao said: "Very good." Chairman Mao talked about the great achievements made by the Soviet Union, the man-made satellites went into the sky, the world belongs to the young generation, the Soviet Union is the head of the socialist countries, and the Soviet Union is the head of the socialist camp. They all confirmed that these words are truth. They asked Chairman Mao: "Do you like this Moscow University?" Chairman Mao said: "I like it very much. We don't have it in China yet." They said: "You will definitely have it in the future." Chairman Mao said: "Yes, we will definitely have it in the future." When they wished Chairman Mao good health, Chairman Mao said "Thank you!" in Russian. Finally, Chairman Mao encouraged students from China and the Soviet Union to unite closely. He said that the people of China and the Soviet Union should unite closely. China and the Soviet Union are big countries. As long as we are united, the enemy will be afraid.
    Wang Huijing, a Chinese graduate student at Moscow University, and her neighbor, Seskakova, a fifth-year Soviet female student in the Economics Department, were the happiest that day because Chairman Mao came to visit their dormitory. Chairman Mao walked into the beautiful room and first looked at what books were placed on the desk. Chairman Mao saw a copy of the "People's Daily" dated November 14th on Wang Huijing's bed, and asked with concern: "Which Chinese newspapers can you see here?" Wang Huijing and others answered in unison, and said that the fastest newspapers from Beijing only take two or three days. Chairman Mao nodded and smiled as he listened. After a while, Chairman Mao went to Seskakova's dormitory, where he had a cordial conversation with her.
    It was almost eight o'clock when Chairman Mao came out of the student dormitory. When he appeared in the spacious corridor, Soviet and other foreign students who stayed in the dormitory on their day off surrounded Chairman Mao, greeted him, and shook hands with him. Students from Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia brought Russian versions of Mao Zedong's Selected Works and asked Chairman Mao to sign them. Chairman Mao satisfied their request.
    At this time, the front gate of Moscow University was already open. More and more people gathered inside and outside, and more and more people gathered to see him off. On the quiet Lenin Hills, a sound of "Goodbye, Chairman Mao!" rang out. When Chairman Mao and the cars of the delegation members drove away from Moscow University, the students still stood at the gate for a while. At this time, Sun Meiling, a student studying abroad, shouted happily: "I shook hands with Chairman Mao." Someone else interjected: "The most important thing is to remember Chairman Mao's words."

    毛主席会见留苏学生
    自从毛主席率领我国代表团到达莫斯科以后，莫斯科的我国留学生和实习生，都想同毛主席见见面，看看毛主席和蔼的面容，听听毛主席宏亮的声音。这些天，我国驻苏联大使馆不断接到他们的信件和电话，要求把他们的这个愿望转达给毛主席。他们都相信，毛主席是非常关心他们的，只要稍有空闲，总会同他们见面的。他们的愿望终于实现了。
    11月17日，星期日。头一天莫斯科下了第一场雪。这天的天气非常晴朗，一早就出了太阳。早晨，当苏联机关和学校的人员正在安静休息的时候，莫斯科的我国留学生和实习生都集合到列宁山上的莫斯科大学，来听我国代表团团员陆定一同志关于国内情况的报告。留学生和实习生们都非常高兴，他们料想也能看到毛主席。
    这天来的人特别多，大约有三千五百人，莫斯科大学宽大的礼堂坐得满满的，另外还占了一个俱乐部和一个教室。在报告中间，留学生、实习生们纷纷地写条子给刘晓大使，询问毛主席是否来，并且希望毛主席来。陆定一同志的报告到下午三点多钟才结束。这时候大家全知道毛主席可能来，高兴得不断地鼓掌和欢呼，整个大礼堂都沸腾起来了。
    下午六点钟，毛主席和中国代表团团员邓小平、彭德怀、乌兰夫、陈伯达、杨尚昆、胡乔木等同志由刘晓大使陪同来到了莫斯科大学。当毛主席和代表团团员们在大礼堂的讲台上出现的时候，全场的人都站起来欢呼、鼓掌，高喊：“毛主席，你好！”“毛主席万岁！”毛主席走到讲台的前沿，从左边走到右边，向大家招手致意，这时台下出现了一片手的波浪，大家都举起手来向毛主席欢呼致敬，暴风雨般的掌声和欢呼声一直继续了十分钟左右，才逐渐静止下来。
    毛主席首先向留学生、实习生们问好，然后向他们说：世界是你们的，也是我们的，但是归根结底是你们的。你们青年人朝气蓬勃，正在兴旺时期，好像早晨八、九点钟的太阳。希望寄托在你们身上。毛主席非常有风趣的话引起了大家的笑声和掌声。
    接着毛主席在讲话中给大家谈了当前国际形势，他首先指出，十月社会主义革命是人类历史上一个转折点，两个人造卫星上了天，六十八个国家的共产党到莫斯科来庆祝十月革命节，这是一个新的转折点。社会主义力量超过了帝国主义力量。我们社会主义阵营要有个头，这个头就是苏联，敌人也有个头，就是美国。如果没有头，力量就会削弱。毛主席说，世界的风向变了。社会主义阵营和资本主义阵营之间的斗争不是西风压倒东风，就是东风压倒西风。现在全世界共有二十七亿人口，社会主义各国的人口将近十亿，独立了的旧殖民地国家的人口有七亿多，正在争取独立或者争取完全独立以及不属于帝国主义阵营的资本主义国家人口有六亿，帝国主义阵营的人口不过四亿左右，而且他们的内部是分裂的。那里会发生“地震”。现在不是西风压倒东风，而是东风压倒西风。毛主席说到这里，大厅里响起了一阵暴风雨般的掌声。
    然后毛主席又谈了国内的情况。他说：真正的彻底的社会主义革命不是一朝一夕可以成功的。在我国真正的社会主义革命的胜利，有人认为在一九五六年，我看实际上是在一九五七年。一九五六年改变了所有制，这是比较容易的，一九五七年才在政治上、思想上取得了社会主义革命的胜利。他说，现在右派是打垮了，我们工作中的缺点还是有的。这次整风是件很大的事，我们要认真地改。世界上怕就怕“认真”二字，共产党就最讲“认真”。
    最后，毛主席再次祝贺大家，向大家说，世界是属于你们的。中国的前途是属于你们的。
    毛主席的话像露水般滴进渴望着祖国的留学生们的心里。
    毛主席讲完话，亲切地向热烈鼓掌的人们招手致意。这时从大礼堂走廊人群里传出了一个声音：“毛主席，请你不要走，要坐下歇歇。”
    毛主席微笑地点了点头，慈祥地望着大家，坐下来点燃了一支香烟慢慢地吸着。这时他把身体向前一靠，问底下坐在前排的留学生的生活。
    五分钟过去了，毛主席站了起来，用慈爱的眼光向大家看了看。留学生们的脸上露出了压制不住的喜悦：毛主席一定看到了自己！毛主席吸完了香烟，把烟头放在烟灰碟里。这时同学们都知道毛主席应该休息去了，惜别的情绪紧扣着每个人的心弦。在这平静的刹那，一个聪明的女学生半红着脸高叫了一声：“毛主席，祝你健康！”这时会场从沉静中惊醒过来，此起彼落地欢呼起来。毛主席离开了座位，走到了学生们面前，亲切地向大家说了声：“谢谢你们。”才慢慢地离开大礼堂。每个人都目送着毛主席魁梧的背影，眼睛里流露出高兴的光芒。
    毛主席走到后院的学生俱乐部，那里聚集着大礼堂容纳不下的中国留学生。毛主席向他们问好。这时几百双眼睛望着毛主席，好像同时在说：我们刚才只能从麦克风里听到你的讲话，现在再给我们讲两句吧！“我只给你们讲三句，”毛主席望着大家微笑地说：“第一，青年人既要勇敢又要谦虚；第二，祝你们身体好、学习好、将来工作好；第三，和苏联朋友要亲密团结。”
    毛主席从俱乐部出来，顺路到莫斯科大学经济系宿舍会客室休息，那里正好有四位苏联女学生，一位名叫契科爱娃的经济系女学生，一见毛主席就用清晰的中国话向毛主席说：“你好！”毛主席问她：“你懂中文吗？”她说：“不懂，我过去和一位中国女同学在一个房间里住过，向她学会了一句。”毛主席和这几位苏联女学生亲切地谈了二十多分钟的话。她们说：“你来这里是我们莫大的光荣。”毛主席说：“我也很光荣。”她们问毛主席对参加十月革命四十周年庆祝的感想，毛主席说：“非常好。”毛主席谈到苏联获得了很大的成就，人造卫星上了天，世界是年青一代的，苏联是社会主义国家的头，苏联是社会主义阵营的头。她们都确认这些话是真理。她们问毛主席：“你喜欢这个莫斯科大学吗？”毛主席说：“很喜欢，我们中国现在还没有。”她们说：“你们将来一定会有。”毛主席说：“是的，将来一定会有。”当她们祝毛主席健康时，毛主席用俄文说了声：“谢谢！”最后毛主席勉励中苏两国同学要紧密团结。他说，中苏两国人民要紧密团结。中国和苏联是大国，只要我们团结一致，敌人就害怕。
    莫斯科大学中国研究生王蕙菁和她的邻居——经济系五年级苏联女学生谢斯卡科娃这天是最高兴了，因为毛主席来参观了她们的宿舍。毛主席走进了漂亮的房间，先看了看书桌上放着什么书。毛主席看到王蕙菁的床铺上放着一张11月14日的“人民日报”，就关心地问：“你们这里能看到哪些中国报纸？”王蕙菁等齐声回答了，并且说从北京来的报纸最快的只要两三天。毛主席一面听着一面点头微笑。过了片刻以后毛主席到了谢斯卡科娃的宿舍，在她的宿舍里毛主席亲切地和她谈了话。
    快八点钟了，毛主席才从学生宿舍里出来。当他出现在宽敞的走廊里的时候，在休息日留在宿舍的苏联和其他外国学生，把毛主席围起来，向毛主席问好，和毛主席握手。保加利亚和捷克斯洛伐克的学生拿来了俄文版的毛泽东选集，请毛主席签名，毛主席满足了他们的要求。
    这时候，莫斯科大学正面的大门已经打开了。里里外外人们越集越多，欢送的人们越集越多。在平静的列宁山上，响起了一片“毛主席，再见！”的声音。当毛主席和代表团团员们的汽车远离莫斯科大学的时候，学生们还在大门口站了一会，这时候，留学生孙美玲高兴地嚷开了：“我同毛主席握了手。”不知谁又插了一句：“最重要的是要把毛主席的话记住。”
