Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang Dispatch: In the minority areas of Guizhou Province, every county now has a middle school and every township has an elementary school.

In various minority areas of Guizhou Province, schools are increasing year by year with economic development. At present, the province has 792 ethnic normal schools, ethnic middle schools and elementary schools, an increase of 239 over 1953. There are more than 340,000 minority students in middle and elementary schools, a fifteen-fold increase over 1950. In the normal schools and secondary schools of the Qian Dongnan Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture, minority students account for 54%, and minority elementary school students account for 63% of the total number of elementary school students in the prefecture. In Duyun, Dushan, and Huishui counties of the Qian Nan Buyi and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, the current number of students is ten to eleven times higher than in 1948, the peak year of educational development during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang. Ceheng and Changshun counties, where the Buyi people live, which never had middle schools before, have successively established middle schools.

These ethnic middle and elementary schools pay attention to collecting local vivid ethnic folk songs, dances, and heroic stories to combine with education. In addition, in light of the needs and interests of minority female students, many elementary schools have organized ethnic costume pattern drawing and embroidery groups in extracurricular activities. Wengxiang Ethnic Elementary School in Lushan County has also set up a special embroidery room in the school to provide female students with embroidery during rest and after-school hours. The masses have responded well, dispelling parents' concerns that their daughters would not know how to embroider after going to school. In 1956, nineteen embroidery crafts made by Miao female students such as Pan Zhimei from this school were selected for exhibition in the German Democratic Republic.

Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, 19th: Since the spring of last year, 20 wired broadcasting stations and 400 radio stations have been established in minority areas of Guizhou Province. Now, most counties in the Miao and Buyi areas of Qian Dongnan and Qian Nan have broadcasting stations or radio stations.

These established broadcasting stations and radio stations broadcast important programs from the Central People's Broadcasting Station and the Guizhou Provincial People's Broadcasting Station to the people of all ethnic groups every day, which has educated and encouraged the people of all ethnic groups. When members of the Songbai Agricultural Cooperative in Songtong Township, Huangping County, lacked confidence in expanding the area of autumn planting last autumn, they heard on the radio about the experience of other agricultural cooperatives in striving to expand the area of autumn planting according to the national plan, which strengthened their confidence, and as a result, the sown area exceeded the original plan by 100 mu. During the summer harvest last year, Caizi Township in Qianxi County promptly organized members to harvest wheat and rapeseed due to hearing news about the possibility of rainstorms on the radio beforehand, saving the entire township from losses.

The twenty counties that have established wired broadcasting stations have now added ethnic programs. Huangping, Shibing, and other counties where the Miao people live broadcast in the Miao language, promptly conveying various policies to the masses.

    县县有中学　乡乡有小学
    贵州少数民族地区文教事业欣欣向荣
    广播站和收音站已经普遍建立
    新华社贵阳电　贵州省少数民族地区，现在已县县有中学，乡乡有小学。
    贵州省各少数民族地区，随着经济发展，学校年年增加。现在全省已有民族师范、民族中学和小学七百九十二所，比1953年增加二百三十九所，少数民族中、小学生已有三十四万多人，比1950年增加了十五倍。黔东南苗族侗族自治州的师范学校和中等学校里，少数民族学生已占54％，少数民族小学生已占全州小学生总数的63％。黔南布依族苗族自治州的都匀、独山、惠水三县，现有的学生人数，比国民党反动统治时期教育发展最高的1948年增加十到十一倍。从来没有中学的册亨、长顺等布依族人民聚居的县，都相继有了中学。
    在这些民族中学和小学校里，都注意搜集当地生动的民族歌谣、舞蹈和英雄故事结合进行教育。此外，结合少数民族女学生的需要和爱好，不少小学在课外活动中组织了民族服装图案绘制和刺绣小组。炉山县翁项民族小学还在学校里专设了一个刺绣室，供给女学生在休息和课余时间绣花。群众反映很好，解除了家长怕女孩子上学后不会绣花的顾虑。1956年，这个学校的苗族女学生潘志美等十九人作的十九件刺绣工艺品，曾被选送到德意志民主共和国去展览。
    新华社贵阳19日电　贵州省少数民族地区从去年春季起，已先后建立起二十个有线广播站和四百个收音站。现在黔东南和黔南的苗族和布依族聚居区，绝大部分县都有了广播站或收音站。
    这些已建立的广播站和收音站，每天都向各族人民转播中央人民广播电台和贵州省人民广播电台的重要节目，使各族人民受到了教育和鼓舞。黄平县松桐乡松柏农业社社员在去年秋天扩大秋种面积时缺乏信心，后来从广播中听到其他农业社根据国家计划努力扩大秋种面积的经验，就增强了信心，结果播种面积超过原计划一百亩。黔西县菜子乡在去年夏收中，由于事先在广播里听到将有暴雨的消息，就及时组织社员抢收小麦和油菜，使全乡免除了损失。
    已经建立起有线广播站的二十个县现在都增设了民族节目。苗族聚居的黄平、施秉等县用苗族语言进行广播，及时地把各项政策传达给了群众。
