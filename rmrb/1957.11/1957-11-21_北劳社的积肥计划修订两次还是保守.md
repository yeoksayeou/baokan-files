    Beilaoshe's Manure Accumulation Plan Revised Twice But Still Conservative

    (Our dispatch) The cadres of Beilaoshe in Yangjia Township, Haikang County, Guangdong Province, when formulating this year's winter planting manure accumulation plan, did not fully recognize the enthusiasm of the masses for production. They only required 15 *dan* of manure accumulation per *mu*, thinking that it would be good enough to complete if it was 7 *dan* more than last year. They did not expect that in just a few days, the manure accumulation per *mu* had exceeded 15 *dan*. Only then did the cadres revise the plan and propose a target of 20 *dan* per *mu*. The members exceeded this requirement within ten days as well. The target was then raised again to 30 *dan* per *mu*. By October 28, the average manure accumulation of the whole society had reached 27 *dan* per *mu*. The director of the society said: "It seems that the plan for 30 *dan* of manure accumulation per *mu* is again conservative."

    北劳社的积肥计划修订两次还是保守
    本报讯　广东省海康县杨家乡北劳社的干部，在制订今年冬种积肥计划时，对于群众生产积极性认识不足，只要求每亩积肥十五担，以为比去年多七担，能够完成就算很不错了。他们意料不到过不了几天，每亩积肥已超过十五担。干部这才修订计划，提出每亩二十担的指标。这个要求，社员也在十天内超过了。指标于是再次提高为每亩三十担。到10月28日，全社积肥平均每亩已达二十七担。社主任说：“看来每亩积肥三十担的计划又保守了。”
