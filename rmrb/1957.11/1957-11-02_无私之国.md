    A Nation of Selflessness
    Song Gong
    I lack both production knowledge and electrical common sense. Therefore, after visiting the Beijing Electron Tube Factory, only two things impressed me deeply.
    First, it's about a Soviet expert at the factory. Once, this expert went to the hospital to have his tonsils removed. The day after the operation, a problem arose in production, and the factory sent someone to the hospital to consult the expert. The doctor firmly refused the meeting, but the expert, upon learning of it, insisted on meeting. His incision was still bleeding, and every time he spoke, he had to painfully spit out saliva; and strands of blood seeped into the saliva, which he spat out, mouthful by mouthful. The expert persisted in this way until the problem was solved.
    The blood of the Chinese and Soviet people has long been mingled in the Sino-Soviet friendship. In the years when the Russian people fought for liberation, the Chinese people shed blood with them; and when the Chinese people engaged in the national liberation struggle, the blood of Soviet soldiers also flowed on Chinese soil. This is well known to everyone. Therefore, the selfless spirit of this expert in helping our country's construction is very easy to understand; however, this matter still moved me very much, because this is, after all, in peaceful construction!
    The other thing is about the equipment in the factory. It is said that the equipment in this factory is the most advanced in the world. Some are even not yet installed in Soviet factories; they were first transported to our factory immediately after successful testing in the laboratory.
    The former matter illustrates a selfless person; the latter illustrates a selfless nation. I think that selfless people are found all over the world. We all know that Comrade Norman Bethune, the outstanding son of the Canadian people and a communist, also gave his blood and life for the Chinese people. But selfless countries are rare. Apart from the socialist camp, they cannot be found. Capitalist countries are afraid of lagging behind in competition, so how can they easily grant new technologies to others? Even these selfless people mostly grow up in the Soviet Union. As long as you go to any piece of Chinese land where Soviet comrades have left their footprints, you will find moving stories like that of the expert to testify. I think this is also because the Soviet Union is a socialist country.
    When I wrote this short article, I deeply regretted not having recorded the name of that expert and the names of those pieces of equipment; but I also felt that these individuals and equipment were actually just representing a great collective. I am familiar with the name of this great collective, which is "Soviet Union," especially "socialist countries."
    I finally wrote out this point, with the intention of, on the one hand, making people who are enthusiastic about Sino-Soviet friendship cherish our friendship even more; on the other hand, also making some other people understand: before slandering the Soviet Union in Sino-Soviet relations, they should always go to places where Soviet people have been to sniff around and ask questions. Relying solely on "high blood pressure" and "hotheaded" "impulse" to spout nonsense is not only difficult to tolerate, but also likely to be laughed at!

    无私之国
    宋功
    我是既缺乏生产知识，更缺乏电学常识的，因此参观了北京电子管厂，看到很多东西，只有两件事印象最深。
    其一，是关于这个厂的一个苏联专家的。有一次这位专家到医院去割了扁桃腺，刚刚动过手术的第二天，生产上就发生了一个难题，厂子里便派人来医院请教专家。医生坚决拒绝这种会见，但专家知道了，却坚决地接见了。当时刀口还在出血，他每说一句话，总要痛苦地吐出唾液来；而血缕也就渗在唾液中一口一口地吐出。这位专家，终于这样坚持到解决了那个问题。
    中苏友谊中早就凝有中苏人民的鲜血。在俄国人民争取解放的那些年代里，中国人民就跟他们一起流过血；而当中国人民从事民族解放斗争时，苏联士兵的血也在中国土地上流过。这是大家都知道了的。因此，对于这位专家帮助我国建设的这种忘我精神，也就十分容易理解；可是，这件事还是使我十分感动，因为这毕竟是在和平的建设中啊！
    另一件事，是关于厂内的设备的。据说这个厂内的设备，都是世界上最新式的。有些是连苏联厂内还未曾安装过的，只是当试验室内刚刚试验成功以后，就首先运给我们的这厂子了。
    前一件事说明了一个无私的人；而后一件事说明的却是一个无私的国家。我以为，无私的人，是遍布于世界的。我们都还会知道，加拿大人民的优秀儿子、共产党员白求恩同志，也曾为中国人民付出了鲜血和生命。但无私的国家，却不可多得，舍却社会主义阵营，便再不会找寻得到的。资本主义国家，竞争犹恐不及，哪里还肯把新的技术授柄于人呢？就是这无私的人，也是特多地生长在苏联。只要到留有苏联同志足迹的任何一块中国土地上去走走，便都会有像那位专家那样的动人事迹出来作证。我想这又是因为苏联是个社会主义国家的缘故。
    我写这篇短文的时候，深悔没有记下那位专家的名字和那些设备的名称；却又觉得这些个人、设备等等，其实又不过是代表着一个伟大的集体，对于这个伟大的名字我是熟知的，这就是“苏联”，特别是“社会主义国家”。
    我终于写出了这点意思，用意不外乎一方面使热衷于中苏友谊的人们，知此更加珍重我们的友谊；另一方面也使另一些人明白：在从中苏关系上中伤苏联以前，总应该也到苏联人到过的地方去嗅一嗅，问一问。只凭了“血压高”“脑瓜热”的“冲动”，就信口雌黄，除了难以令人容忍以外，怕也还要为人所笑的吧！
