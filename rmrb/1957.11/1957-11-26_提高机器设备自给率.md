A Review and Outlook of the First Five-Year Plan

    Increase the Self-Sufficiency Rate of Machinery and Equipment Xie Bei Yi
    Before liberation, China's machinery manufacturing industry was very backward. The vast majority of machinery factories were mainly engaged in repair and assembly, and hardly produced any decent mechanical products. Most of the machinery and equipment needed by the industrial and transportation sectors had to be imported. Taking 1936 before the Anti-Japanese War as an example, according to the data collected by the National Bureau of Statistics, it is estimated that in this year when there was not much construction, about 80% of the machinery and equipment needed nationwide was imported from abroad, and the self-sufficiency rate of machinery and equipment was only about 20%.
    In the eight years since liberation, China's machinery industry has undergone fundamental changes. The original enterprises have undergone consolidation, reorganization, reconstruction, and expansion. In particular, the new large-scale machinery factories have been put into production one after another, which has enabled China's machinery industry to embark on the road of independent manufacturing from a state of only being able to repair and assemble. During the period of the First Five-Year Plan, due to the rapid development of the production capacity and technical level of the machinery industry, China's self-sufficiency rate of machinery and equipment has been increased to about 60% in large-scale construction.
    Increasing the self-sufficiency rate of equipment can give full play to the potential of the domestic machinery industry, improve the technical level of the machinery industry, ensure construction needs, and speed up the progress of construction. Moreover, in terms of equipment prices, products produced in batches domestically are generally cheaper than imported equipment. To strive to increase the self-sufficiency rate of machinery and equipment is a serious task for China's machinery manufacturing sector for a certain period in the future. The degree of self-sufficiency of machinery and equipment is also one of the main indicators for measuring China's socialist industrialization.
        Vigorously Increase Variety
    In order to increase China's self-sufficiency rate of machinery and equipment, the first thing to do is to vigorously increase the variety of new mechanical products.
    In recent years, China's machinery industry has made many efforts in expanding product varieties and has achieved considerable success. From 1953 to 1957, the new products expected to be added by the factories under the First Ministry of Machine Building alone exceeded 1,200 (excluding new varieties of various tools, grinding wheels, and bearings); the national machinery industry reached about 3,000. However, from the perspective of the needs of various departments of the national economy for the machinery industry, it is far from meeting the requirements. At present, China's self-sufficiency rate of machinery and equipment has reached more than 60% in terms of equipment value, but in terms of product variety, it is only about 30% on average. Taking machine tools as an example, nearly 1,000 varieties were needed during the First Five-Year Plan period, while China currently only produces about 250 varieties. Therefore, increasing the variety of new mechanical products is the key to further improving equipment self-sufficiency in the future.
    To expand product varieties, it is necessary to strengthen product design work. Before liberation and in the early days of liberation, China rarely designed products on its own, but the situation has changed greatly now. In the system of the First Ministry of Machine Building, during the First Five-Year Plan period, self-designed products have accounted for 20% of all new products; the structure and quality of major products, such as the Heping (Peace) type steam locomotive, the 8,600-ton coastal freighter, and the 12,000-kilowatt steam turbine, have reached or approached international advanced levels. Of course, self-design does not mean that everything should be original and unique, but should inherit and utilize existing design achievements at home and abroad, and combine them with China's specific conditions and the requirements of the user departments to bring forth new ideas and gradually improve. Here, it is very necessary for the product design forces of enterprises and the mechanical research institutes (institutes) of the ministries and bureaus, as well as relevant departments such as the Academy of Sciences and universities, to reasonably divide the work and cooperate closely; it is also very important to strengthen the exchange of technical information at home and abroad.
    In addition to strengthening the self-design work of products, boldly carrying out surveying and imitation is an important way for China to increase the variety of new machine products under the current circumstances. During the First Five-Year Plan period, the products and process drawings provided by the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic Countries played a significant role in improving the technical level of China's machinery industry. In the future, we still need to strive for this kind of assistance, but we must never develop a mentality of dependence and laziness because of this. When there are difficulties in the supply of drawings from abroad, we cannot sit still and wait, but should boldly and boldly carry out surveying and imitation based on physical samples for trial production. In carrying out surveying and imitation, we should pay attention to overcoming the idea that increasing new varieties requires rebuilding factories and equipping them with complete sets of special equipment. Some people believe that if products produced in batches are not rebuilt factories and have no special equipment, even if they are trial-produced, they are uneconomical. However, the C-6 type grain combine harvester surveyed and imitated by the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory cost 40,000 yuan per unit in 1955, but this year it has been reduced to 14,000 or 15,000 yuan. This fact shows that after trial-producing new products, as long as we vigorously improve various tasks and gradually reduce costs, it is entirely possible.
    Product serialization and parts standardization are important conditions for rapidly expanding product varieties and improving technical levels. The mechanical products of old China did not have a certain series, and there were very few universal parts and standard parts for machines; after liberation, some work has been done in this regard, but it has not been fully developed. This has caused a waste of some technical forces and affected the arrangement of new product trial production plans and the rapid increase in product varieties. The work of product serialization and standardization should start with products such as motors, transformers, fans, pumps, and machine tools, which are versatile and have a large demand, and then gradually extend to products such as diesel engines, gas compressors, agricultural machinery, and petroleum machinery. In compiling serialization and selection work, we must seriously learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic Countries, and at the same time pay close attention to combining the specific characteristics of China (resources, climate, etc.) to avoid blindly copying and acting subjectively.
    In addition, formulating long-term development plans for mechanical products, strengthening the planning and organization of new products, doing a good job in the collaborative supporting work in the trial production of new products, and determining the funding expenditures and incentive methods for the trial production of new products are all closely related to the rapid increase in the variety of mechanical products.
      Organize Complete Set Production
    Organizing the complete set production of equipment is of great importance to improving China's self-sufficiency rate of machinery and equipment. In recent years, although the variety of mechanical industrial products has continued to increase, we still cannot supply many major equipment in complete sets; especially for key construction projects aided by foreign countries, the proportion of self-made equipment cannot be rapidly increased (the self-made proportion was about 45% in 1955, 47% in 1956, and the agreement was 42.5% in 1957, and the expected execution result will be improved). Since there are many difficulties in the mutual connection between the supply of complete sets of equipment from home and abroad, it is difficult to retain some domestically manufactured parts for domestic supply in complete sets of equipment. For example, for the 1,150 mm primary rolling mill and the 2,800 mm steel plate rolling mill, because China cannot produce them in complete sets, it is very difficult to retain domestically manufactured parts such as connecting roller tables, cooling beds, and lubrication equipment for domestic self-manufacturing. In organizing the complete set production of equipment, although there are many products that are difficult to solve in the short term due to the limitations of technical equipment conditions; however, many products cannot be supplied in complete sets due to the lack of necessary organizational work. For example, steam turbine blowers for blast furnace systems, charging machines for open hearth furnace systems, high-pressure feed water pumps and automatic control equipment for power plants, etc., there is not much technical problem if they can be trial-produced as soon as possible. In addition, the cooperation and coordination between machinery and electrical appliances is also not close enough at present. Some major equipment often cannot be supplied in complete sets because some parts or electrical control equipment are not produced in time. Therefore, in the future, the relevant departments should not only grasp the trial production plan of individual new products, but also incorporate the trial production work of complete sets of equipment such as power stations, blast furnaces, rolling mills, and nitrogen fertilizer equipment into the national plan item by item, and give full support in terms of material allocation. Only in this way can we ensure that China's industry rapidly embarks on the road of self-reliance.
    Strengthen Collaboration and Cooperation Between Enterprises
    In expanding product varieties and organizing the production of complete sets of equipment, the collaboration and cooperation of relevant enterprises is very important. Effective collaboration and cooperation is an important link to ensure the trial production and production of major new products. Taking the large air compressor to be trial-produced next year (which is one of the major equipment for nitrogen fertilizer plants) as an example: large forged steel parts such as spindles and large cast iron parts such as machine bases must be supplied by other factories in collaboration, and the supporting large AC motor also needs to be designed and trial-produced by the motor factory. Once these parts that need to be supplied by external factories have problems or the supply is delayed, the large air compressor may not be trial-produced next year. As for the complete set supply of power station equipment, nitrogen fertilizer equipment, and rolling mill equipment, it is necessary to organize the collaboration and cooperation of many factories. However, these factories are distributed all over the country and belong to different affiliations; and some products are uniformly distributed, some are managed by the ministry, some are self-sold, some are included in the plan, some are tasks outside the plan, and some need to be designed and trial-produced. Under such circumstances, if the relevant enterprises do not have reasonable production arrangements, full cooperation spirit, coordinated trial production plans, and effective inspection and supervision, it is difficult to ensure the production and supply of complete sets of equipment. This requires certain institutions (such as complete set companies) and systems (such as the general delivery person system), and also requires the strong support of the relevant ministries, bureaus, economic commissions, and provinces and cities.
    Improve Equipment Selection Work
    The selection of equipment types in factory design is directly related to China's technical policy and directly affects the self-sufficiency rate of machinery and equipment. Foreign design departments select the latest and most advanced technical equipment for our factories based on the technical level and economic conditions of advanced countries, especially the latest achievements of the machinery manufacturing industry and the materials industry, and their starting point is completely understandable. However, some of our comrades often do not give enough consideration to China's specific conditions, especially to the full utilization of domestic machine manufacturing power and the use of similar models of domestic equipment when approving designs, and sometimes even propose to select the latest equipment that has not yet been finalized abroad. This will not only increase construction costs, but also increase foreign exchange expenditures. This phenomenon can be avoided. For example, in a power station expansion design, it was originally planned to use a foreign latest type of high-pressure boiler with an evaporation capacity of 220 tons per hour, but China currently does not have the conditions to manufacture this product; now it is changed to the same model of high-pressure boiler with an evaporation capacity of 230 tons per hour, because China already has drawings and manufacturing conditions, it can be retained for domestic self-manufacturing without having to order from abroad. There are similar examples in domestic design projects. Therefore, in the future, when conducting factory design and approving foreign designs in China, we should fully consider the specific conditions of the domestic machine manufacturing industry and the materials industry, and use domestic equipment as much as possible. At the same time, when approving factory designs, we should also absorb relevant personnel from the machinery industry department to participate and jointly study the selection of major equipment.
    During the Second Five-Year Plan period, there are many favorable conditions for gradually increasing the self-sufficiency rate of equipment. As long as we strengthen leadership, unify understanding, vigorously develop product varieties, and organize the production and supply of complete sets of equipment, it is entirely possible to increase China's self-sufficiency rate of equipment from the current 60% to more than 80% during the Second Five-Year Plan period.

专栏：第一个五年的回顾与前瞻

    提高机器设备自给率	谢北一
    解放以前，我国机械制造工业十分落后，绝大多数的机械厂都是以修配为主要业务，几乎没有生产过比较像样的机械产品。工业、交通运输部门需要的机器设备大部分都要进口。以抗战以前的1936年为例，据国家统计局收集的资料估算，在这个并没有进行什么建设的年份当中，全国所需要的机器设备即有80％左右是从国外进口的，机器设备自给率只达20％上下。
    解放八年来，我国机械工业已经发生了根本性的变化。原有的企业经过裁并组合，改建扩建，特别是新建大型机械工厂陆续投入生产，已经使我国机械工业从只能修配的状态走上独立制造的道路。第一个五年计划期间，由于机械工业的生产能力和技术水平有了飞跃的发展，在大规模建设中，我国机器设备自给率已经提高到60％左右。
    提高设备自给率可以充分发挥国内机械工业的潜力，提高机械工业的技术水平，保证建设需要，加快建设进度。而且从设备价格上说，国内成批生产的产品，一般也比进口设备价格要便宜。为提高机器设备的自给率而斗争，在今后一定时期内，是我国机械制造部门的严重任务。机器设备的自给程度，也是衡量我国社会主义工业化的主要标志之一。
        大力增加品种
    为了提高我国机器设备的自给率，首先就要大力增加新的机械产品品种。
    几年来，我国机械工业在扩大产品品种方面作了许多努力，也取得了不小的成就。从1953年到1957年，仅第一机械工业部所属各厂预计增加的新产品即在一千二百种以上（不包括各种工具、砂轮和轴承的新品种数字）；全国机械工业，则达三千种左右。但是，从国民经济各部门对机械工业的需要来说，还远不能满足要求。目前，我国机器设备的自给率从设备价值上看已经达60％以上，但是从产品品种来看，却平均不过30％左右。如以机床为例，第一个五年计划期间需要的品种近一千种，而我国目前仅生产了二百五十种左右。所以，增加新的机器产品品种，是今后进一步提高设备自给率的关键。
    要扩大产品品种，就要加强产品设计工作。解放以前和解放初期，我国很少自行设计产品，现在情况已有很大的改变。在第一机械工业部系统，第一个五年计划期间，自行设计的产品已经占全部新产品的20％；重大的产品，如和平型蒸汽机车、排水量八千六百吨的沿海货轮、一万二千瓩汽轮机等，其结构和质量已经达到或者接近国际先进水平。当然，自行设计并不是要样样独出心裁，别树一帜，而是应该继承和利用国内外已有的设计成果，结合我国的具体情况和需用部门的要求，推陈出新，逐步改进。在这里，企业的产品设计力量和部局的机械研究院（所）以及科学院、大专学校等有关部门，合理地进行分工而又密切合作，是很必要的；加强国内外技术情报的交流也很重要。
    除了加强产品的自行设计工作以外，大胆地进行测绘仿制，是我国当前情况下增加新机器产品品种的重要途径。第一个五年计划期间，苏联和人民民主国家供给我们产品和工艺图纸，曾对我国机械工业技术水平的提高起了重大的作用。今后我们还需要争取这种援助，但是我们绝不能因此而产生依赖心理和懒汉思想。在国外供应图纸有困难的时候，不能坐待不前，而应该放手地、大胆地根据实样进行测绘和仿造试制。在开展测绘仿制工作中，应该注意克服那种认为增加新的品种就要改建工厂、配备全套专用设备的想法。有人认为，成批生产的产品如果不改建工厂，没有专用设备，即令试制出来，也是不经济的。但是，北京农业机械厂测绘仿制的C—6型谷物联合收割机，1955年每台成本是四万元，今年已经降低到一万四、五千元。这个事实说明，试制出新产品以后，只要大力改进各项工作，逐步降低成本是完全可能的。
    产品系列化和零部件标准化，是迅速扩大产品品种，提高技术水平的重要条件。旧中国的机械产品没有一定的系列，机器的通用件和标准件很少；解放以后，这方面的工作已经作了一些，但还没有全面展开。这就造成了一些技术力量的浪费，影响了新产品试制计划的安排和产品品种的迅速增加。产品系列化和标准化的工作，应该从通用性和需要量较大的电机、变压器、扇风机、泵、机床等产品着手，再逐步推及柴油机、气体压缩机、农业机械、石油机械等产品。在编订系列化和选型工作中，必须认真学习苏联和人民民主国家的先进经验，同时要十分注意结合中国的具体特点（资源、气候等），避免盲目照抄，主观行事。
    此外，编制机械产品的长远发展计划，加强新产品的计划工作和组织工作，作好新产品试制中的协作配套工作，确定新产品试制的经费开支和奖励办法等，都是同迅速增加机械产品品种有密切关系的工作。
      组织成套生产
    组织设备的成套生产，对于提高我国机器设备自给率有非常重大的关系。几年来，机械工业产品品种虽然不断增加，但是很多重大设备我们还不能成套供应；特别是国外援助的重点建设项目，自制设备的比重还不能迅速提高（1955年自制比重约为45％，1956年为47％，1957年协议为42．5％，预计执行结果将会提高一些）。由于成套设备分别由国内外供应在相互联系上有很多困难，所以在成套设备中，有些国内能够制造的也很难留在国内供应。例如一千一百五十公厘初轧机和二千八百公厘的钢板轧机，因为我国不能成套生产，所以像连接辊道、冷床、润滑设备等我国可以制造的部分、要留下来由国内自制就有很大困难。在组织设备的成套生产中，固然有不少产品是由于技术设备条件的限制，在短期内还难于解决；但是也有不少产品不能成套供应，是由于缺少必要的组织工作而造成的。例如高炉系统的蒸汽透平鼓风机、平炉系统的装料机、电站的高压给水泵和自动控制设备等，如果能尽早动手试制，在技术上是没有多大问题的。另外，机械和电器之间的协作配合，在目前也是不够密切的。有些重大设备，常常因为某些部件或电器控制设备没有及时配合生产而不能成套供应。因此，各有关部门今后不仅要抓单个新产品的试制计划，而且应该逐项逐项地将电站、高炉、轧钢机、氮肥设备等成套设备的试制工作纳入国家计划，并且在材料分配等方面予以充分支持。这样才能保证我国工业迅速走上自力更生的道路。
    加强企业之间的协作配合
    在扩大产品品种和组织成套设备生产中，有关企业的协作配合十分重要。有效的协作配合是保证重大新产品试制生产的重要环节。如以明年试制的大型空压机（它是氮肥工厂的重大设备之一）为例：主轴等大型锻钢件和机座等大型铸铁件，都必须由其他工厂协作供应，而配套的大型交流电机还需要电机工厂设计试制，这些需要由外厂供应的部件一旦发生问题或供应脱期，大型空压机明年就可能试制不出来。至于像电站设备、氮肥设备、轧钢设备等的成套供应，更是需要组织很多工厂的协作配合。但是这些工厂分布在天南地北，隶属关系不同；而产品有的是统一分配，有的是部管，有的是自销，有的纳入了计划，有的是计划外的任务，有的还需要设计试制。在这种情况下，各有关企业如果没有合理的生产安排、充分的协作精神、协调的试制计划以及有效的检查督促，要保证成套设备的生产供应是很困难的。这需要有一定的机构（如成套公司）和制度（如总交货人制度），也需要有关部、局、经委和省、市的有力支持。
    改进设备选型工作
    工厂设计中对设备型式的选择，直接关系到我国的技术政策，也直接影响到机器设备的
  自给率。国外设计部门根据先进国家的技术水平和经济条件，特别是机器制造业和材料工业的最新成就，为我们工厂选择最新式的、最先进的技术装备，其出发点的良好是完全可以理解的。但是，我们有些同志在审批设计的时候，常常对我国的具体条件，特别是对充分利用国内机器制造力量，采用类似型号的国产设备考虑不足，有时甚至提出选用国外尚未定型的最新设备的要求。这样不但会增加建设费用，而且会多支出外汇。这种现象是可以避免的。如有一个电站扩建设计中，原来打算采用国外最新型的每小时蒸发量二百二十吨的高压锅炉，但是我国目前还没有具备制造这种产品的条件；现在改用同型号的每小时蒸发量二百三十吨的高压锅炉，因为我国已有图纸和制造条件，便可留在国内自制而不必向国外订购。国内设计项目中，也有类似的例子。因此，在今后国内进行工厂设计和审批国外设计的时候，都应该充分考虑国内机器制造业和材料工业的具体条件，尽可能地选用国产设备。同时，在审批工厂设计的时候，也应该吸收机械工业部门有关人员参加，共同研究重大设备的选型问题。
    第二个五年计划期间，逐步提高设备自给率有很多有利条件。只要加强领导，统一认识大力发展产品品种，组织好成套设备的生产供应，在第二个五年计划期间把我国设备的自给率由目前的60％左右提高到80％以上，是完全可能的。
