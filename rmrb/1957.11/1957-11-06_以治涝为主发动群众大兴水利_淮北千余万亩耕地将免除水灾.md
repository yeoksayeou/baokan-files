    Launch Mass Water Conservancy Projects Primarily Focused on Flood Control
    More Than Ten Million Mu of Cultivated Land in Northern Anhui Will Be Free from Floods
    (Our Correspondent in Bengbu, 5th) The water conservancy projects that the Huai River Commission plans to build in northern Anhui this winter and next spring will free 13.28 million mu of farmland—nearly one-third of the cultivated land in northern Anhui—from floods that occur once every three to five years.
    The characteristics of the water conservancy projects that the Huai River Commission will build in northern Anhui this winter and next spring are: shifting from flood prevention as the main focus to flood control as the main focus, combining flood prevention and drought resistance, integrating river management and comprehensive farmland water conservancy. In terms of projects, the focus in the past was on large-scale water conservancy construction; now, large, medium, and small-scale water conservancy projects are combined. From building reservoirs, raising and reinforcing dikes, and building culverts and sluices to digging large ditches, building small reservoirs, drilling wells, digging ponds, opening canals, building weirs, and constructing gully dams and mountain dams, medium and small-scale water conservancy projects are being built according to the needs of agricultural development. In the past, the focus was on water conservancy projects invested in by the state; now, in addition to some water conservancy projects invested in by the state, efforts will be made to mobilize the masses and adopt the method of public-private partnerships to turn water conservancy construction into the farmers' own business.
    In order to do this work well, the Huai River Commission specially convened a meeting attended by the heads of eighteen counties in northern Anhui and the Fuyang and Bengbu special districts to fully listen to the opinions and suggestions of various counties on flood control, drought resistance, and flood prevention. Based on these opinions and suggestions, the Huai River Commission formulated a water conservancy construction plan for this winter and next spring, and made specific divisions of labor with the special districts and counties. It was decided that the Huai River Commission will be responsible for the overall planning of water conservancy construction in the northern Anhui area, and will provide water source data and continue to explore water source and other technical issues; as for specific projects, with the exception of certain large-scale water conservancy constructions, the special districts and counties will be responsible. The construction corps originally led by the Huai River Commission has now been assigned to the direct leadership of the Fuyang and Bengbu special districts, and some construction brigades have also been transferred to the direct leadership of the counties, so as to facilitate construction according to local conditions. In the past, the design of water conservancy projects in northern Anhui had to be submitted to the Huai River Commission for review; now, the Huai River Commission has sent two design review teams to the Fuyang and Bengbu special districts to review them locally. In addition, the Huai River Commission will transfer a large number of cadres to various parts of northern Anhui to strengthen local water conservancy construction work. A group of engineering and technical personnel has already been transferred to the Bengbu special district.

### 以治涝为主发动群众大兴水利  淮北千余万亩耕地将免除水灾

    以治涝为主发动群众大兴水利
    淮北千余万亩耕地将免除水灾
    本报蚌埠5日电　治淮委员会计划今冬明春在淮北兴修的水利工程，将使一千三百二十八万亩农田——近淮北三分之一的耕地，免除三年到五年一遇的水灾。
    治淮委员会今冬明春在淮北兴修水利工程的特点是：由防洪为主转为以治涝为主，结合防旱防洪，治理河道和全面的农田水利相结合。在工程方面过去着重大型水利建设；现在把大、中、小型水利工程结合起来。从修水库、加高加固堤防、修涵闸到挖大沟、修小型水库、打井、挖塘、开渠、打圩、筑谷坊、山坝等中、小型水利工程，都根据农业发展的需要，进行兴建。过去是以建设国家投资的水利工程为主；现在除了部分国家投资的水利工程外，还要大力发动群众，采取社办公助的办法，把兴修水利变为农民自己的事。
    淮委为了作好这一工作，特地召开了淮北十八县和阜阳、蚌埠两专区负责人参加的会议，充分听取各县在治涝、防旱、防洪方面的意见和建议。根据这些意见和建议，淮委制定了今冬明春的水利建设计划，并和各专区、县作了具体分工。决定淮委负责淮北地区水利建设的全面规划，并提供水源资料、继续勘探水源等技术上的问题；至于具体工程，除某些大型的水利建设外，由各专区、县负责。淮委原领导的施工总队，现已分属阜阳、蚌埠两专区直接领导，有些施工大队也转由县直接领导，以便于根据当地情况进行施工。过去淮北地区水利工程设计都要送到淮委审核；现在淮委已派出两个设计审核小组分赴阜阳、蚌埠两专区去就地审核。此外，淮委将调出大批干部到淮北各地去加强当地的水利建设工作，目前已调出一批工程技术人员到蚌埠专区。
