Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 21st. According to a survey of 2,342 agricultural cooperatives in 58 counties and cities by relevant departments in Jiangsu Province, 57% of these cooperatives have average yields per mu that have caught up with or exceeded the level of prosperous middle peasants, and more than 26% of the cooperatives have average per capita incomes that have caught up with or exceeded the level of prosperous middle peasants.

Before agricultural collectivization, prosperous middle peasants in Jiangsu Province had an average annual grain yield 10% higher than that of ordinary peasants due to better land conditions, stronger animal power, complete farm tools, and more fertilizer. In addition, prosperous middle peasants had about 20% more arable land per capita than other classes of peasants, and their sideline income was also higher. Coupled with some minor exploitation, their living standards were 30% to 40% higher than those of ordinary peasants. However, in recent years, the enormous advantages of collective management by cooperatives have become increasingly clear, and they are rapidly catching up with the production level of prosperous middle peasants.

In the past, the problem of water conservancy construction, which prosperous middle peasants could not solve when working individually, has been solved by cooperatives because they have brought collective strength into play. For example, the Chengwan Agricultural Cooperative in Wujin County, surrounded by mountains on three sides, built two large reservoirs halfway up the mountains with collective strength, which completely eradicated drought and mountain floods. In less than two years, the poor mountain village has been completely transformed, and the yield of rice per mu has jumped to more than 500 jin, and wheat has jumped to more than 140 jin, exceeding the level of local prosperous middle peasants.

Because agricultural cooperatives concentrate the use of labor and vigorously carry out the fertilizer accumulation campaign, the level of cultivation and fertilization has rapidly caught up with that of prosperous middle peasants. For example, in Fengxian County, prosperous middle peasants used to spend 13 to 15 workdays per mu of cotton field, but now agricultural cooperatives generally spend about 30 workdays. Prosperous middle peasants mainly relied on raising pigs and commercial fertilizers for fertilization, but now the county has not only doubled the number of pigs raised compared with before the cooperatives were established, but also vigorously accumulates various natural fertilizers.

According to the plans of various counties, before 1962, all agricultural cooperatives in Jiangsu Province will reach or exceed the production level and income level of prosperous middle peasants in batches.

This newspaper reports that more than 80% of the agricultural cooperatives in Fengxian County, Jiangsu Province, have caught up with and exceeded the level of prosperous middle peasants in the county. Since the realization of advanced cooperativization in the spring of 1956, due to the support of the state and the increase of public accumulation of agricultural cooperatives, the means of production have generally increased compared with those of prosperous middle peasants. Each agricultural cooperative has added more than 100 water pumps and more than 10,000 sets of pesticide equipment. The county has built more than 70 million cubic meters of earthwork and more than 2.5 million cubic meters of stone water conservancy projects, which have freed 140,000 mu of farmland in the coastal Jiatang area from drought and flood disasters. These are all things that prosperous middle peasants could not do when working individually. The amount of fertilizer applied to rice, wheat, and cotton fields has also exceeded that of prosperous middle peasants. In particular, in the past two years, the Fengxian County Party Committee has vigorously promoted the improvement of three agricultural cultivation systems in accordance with the preliminary plan in the draft agricultural development program: after reversing the idea of emphasizing major crops (rice and wheat) and neglecting minor crops (wheat, rape), the area of wheat, rape and late autumn crops has been expanded, and the land utilization rate of the county has increased from 129% in 1948 to 212%; more than 5,000 mu of double-cropping rice has been promoted in the county, with an average yield of 800 jin per mu this year, an increase of more than 12 million jin of grain compared with planting early rice and mung beans before the change; more than 87,000 mu of medium-season rice, whose yield has always been unstable, has been changed to late rice, with an average increase of 50 jin of grain per mu. Therefore, a bumper harvest of various crops has been achieved this year. The average yield of rice per mu in the county's more than 300,000 mu of paddy fields is 520 jin, an increase of 11.2% compared with the average yield per mu of prosperous middle peasants in extraordinarily good harvest years. The average yield of ginned cotton per mu in the county's 320,000 mu of cotton fields is 182 jin, an increase of 8.2% compared with the unit yield of prosperous middle peasants in 1955. The unit yield of wheat and yuan wheat has also increased by 4.3% compared with that of prosperous middle peasants, and the yield per mu of rape has increased by 40% compared with that of prosperous middle peasants.

Due to the improvement of the production level of agricultural cooperatives, the agricultural cooperatives have conscientiously implemented the policy of running cooperatives diligently and thriftily. The average cost per mu of farmland in the county has decreased by 6 jiao and 3 fen compared with before the establishment of the cooperatives, and the credit loans requested from the state this year have decreased by 71% compared with last year. The county has developed sideline occupations such as pig raising, silkworm raising, sheep raising, and rabbit raising. Therefore, the total output value of agriculture and sideline occupations throughout the year has not only increased by 8 million yuan compared with 1956, but also increased by more than 9 million yuan compared with 1955 before the establishment of the cooperatives, so that the income level of many members has caught up with and exceeded that of prosperous middle peasants.

    江苏农业社在一九六二年以前
    将分批达到富裕中农水平
    奉贤县大部分农业社已经迎头赶上
    据新华社南京21日电 据江苏省有关部门在五十八个县市对二千三百四十二个农业社的调查，这些农业社中，已有57％的社平均每亩耕地产值赶上或超过了富裕中农的水平，26％以上的社每人平均收入赶上或超过了富裕中农的水平。
    农业合作化以前，江苏省富裕中农由于土地条件好、畜力强、农具全、肥料多等因素，粮食年产量平均比一般农民高10％；加上富裕中农每人平均占有的耕地比其它阶层农民多20％左右，副业收入也较多，再加上一些轻微的剥削，生活水平比一般农民要高30％到40％。但是几年来，合作社集体经营的巨大优越性越来越清楚地显示出来，正在迅速地赶上富裕中农的生产水平。
    过去富裕中农在单干时所不能解决的兴修水利问题，合作社因为发挥集体力量而得到解决了。例如武进县三面环山的城湾农业社，以集体力量在半山腰里筑起了两座大水库，根治了旱灾和山洪，不到两年时间完全改变了穷困的山村面貌，水稻每亩产量已经跃进到五百多斤，小麦跃进到一百四十多斤，超过了当地富裕中农的水平。
    由于农业社劳力集中使用，大力开展积肥运动，耕作水平和施肥水平迅速赶上了富裕中农。例如奉贤县过去富裕中农每亩棉田用工十三个到十五个，现在农业社的棉田普遍用工三十个左右。富裕中农施肥主要靠养猪和商品肥料，现在全县不仅养猪数量比办社前增加了一倍，还大力积聚各种自然肥料。
    根据各县的规划，在1962年以前，江苏省的所有农业社都将分批达到或超过富裕中农的生产水平和收入水平。
    本报讯　江苏省奉贤县80％以上的农业社已经赶上并超过了本县富裕中农的水平。这个县自1956年春实现高级合作化以来，由于国家的支持和农业社公共积累的增加，生产资料一般比富裕中农增多，各农业社新添了一百多部抽水机，和一万多架农药器械。全县兴修了七千多万土方和二千五百多石方的水利工程，使沿海夹塘地区十四万亩农田免除了旱涝灾害。这都是富裕中农单干时无法办到的。稻、麦、棉田的施肥量也超过了富裕中农。特别是近两年来，奉贤县党委根据农业发展纲要草案中的初步规划，有力地推行了三项农业耕作制度的改进：在扭转了重大熟（稻麦）轻小熟（麦类、油菜）的思想后，扩大了麦类油菜和晚秋作物的面积，全县土地利用率由1948年的129％增加到212％；全县推广了五千多亩双季稻，今年平均亩产八百斤，比改种前种早稻、绿豆增产了一千二百多万斤粮食；将产量一贯不稳定的八万七千多亩中熟稻，改种了晚稻，平均每亩也可增产五十斤粮食。因此，今年各种农作物都获得了大丰收。全县三十多万亩水稻平均亩产五百二十斤，比富裕中农在特大丰收年的平均每亩产量增加11．2％，三十二万亩棉田平均亩产籽棉一百八十二斤，比1955年富裕中农单位产量增加8．2％，大小麦和元麦单位产量也比富裕中农增加4．3％，油菜单产更比富裕中农增加了40％。
    由于农业社生产水平的提高，各农业社又认真贯彻了勤俭办社的方针，全县每亩农田的成本平均比办社前降低了六角三分，向国家要求信用贷款今年却比去年减少了71％。全县发展了养猪、养蚕、养羊、养兔等副业，因此全年农副业总产值不仅比1956年增加了八百万元收入，而且比办社前的1955年增加了九百多万元，使很多社员收入水平赶上和超过了富裕中农。
