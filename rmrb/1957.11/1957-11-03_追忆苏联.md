	Remembering the Soviet Union
	Mei Lanfang
	Forty years ago, the great revolutionary teacher—Lenin—wisely applied Marxist theory, established the powerful Soviet Communist Party, led the earth-shattering October Socialist Revolution, and created the world's first socialist state. At that time, China was under the heavy oppression of international imperialism, and in the dark years when it was called the Sick Man of East Asia, many patriots tried every means to find ways to save the country from Japan, Britain, and France. The medicines they grabbed could not cure China's illness. It was not until the guns of the October Revolution sounded that our revolutionary pioneers found the effective prescription of Marxism-Leninism, established the Chinese Communist Party, and from then on, followed the path taken by the Russians, learned from the good example of the Soviet Union, overthrew imperialism and all evil forces, overturned all unreasonable systems of exploitation, eradicated the stubborn old roots of thousands of years, and established the new People's Republic of China. While our people are working hard on socialist construction, the Soviet Union has given our country strong support and assistance, making our country stronger and stronger, and moving towards prosperity and happiness.
	Since China's liberation, I have traveled and performed in various places and have personally witnessed the help given to us by Soviet friends.
	In the spring of 1952, I went to Dalian and coincided with the anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance. It was also the eve of the Soviet government's transfer of all the equipment of the Lushunkou naval base to China in accordance with the treaty. We held a performance to entertain Soviet friends. I said to a senior Soviet general: "In the past few years, Soviet comrades have taught us all kinds of experience, enabling us to learn many things. This friendship is sincere and precious." The Soviet friend said with a smile: "Your cadres have grown up. After we leave, I believe they will be able to take on all the responsibilities."
	When I participated in the groundbreaking ceremony of the three major projects of Anshan Iron and Steel, I heard the chairman of the trade union say: "Soviet experts sometimes receive telegrams from their own country in their work, inventing new working methods. They immediately take a plane back to China and bring back the new methods. Therefore, some of the equipment for the three major projects are the latest methods that they have not yet tried."
	The invention of the drilling method for the Yangtze River Bridge and the outstanding achievements of Soviet experts in this area are a miracle known to the world, which I need not introduce. Last year, I crossed Wuhan three times and saw the rapid growth of the bridge. When I performed in Wuchang, I lived next to the bridge and personally witnessed the close work of Soviet comrades with the workers in the cold winter season. What impressed me most was that a Soviet expert came to see my play. After the performance, a Soviet female comrade, on behalf of all the experts building the Yangtze River Bridge, presented flowers on the stage to wish me artistic longevity. I excitedly said to her: "I can hardly find the right words to express my gratitude. I think the huge construction project of the Yangtze River Bridge symbolizes the crystallization of friendly cooperation between the Chinese and Soviet people. It is a flower of friendship in the socialist garden."
	There are many other examples that I cannot list one by one. Below I would like to talk about my impressions of visiting the Soviet Union:
	Before each trip abroad, I always heard different opinions at home. Some people expressed doubts about Chinese opera being performed on foreign stages because they did not value China's traditional theatrical heritage highly. When I received an invitation from the Soviet Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries twenty years ago, I discussed it with friends who were familiar with the situation abroad. They believed that the level of Soviet literature, drama, and music was very high, but our theatrical performance form was not the same as that of the Soviet Union. At the same time, the socialist system was very different from ours. It was uncertain whether Chinese opera could be accepted and understood by them. Although I did not understand the revolutionary principles of Marxism-Leninism at the time, I doubted the above remarks. I felt that despite the different social systems, the national traditions and stylistic characteristics of culture and art could be accepted by them. At the same time, I was eager to see the living conditions of the people under the socialist system. In addition, I also wanted to put the Chinese theatrical performance art on their scales of art to weigh its weight.
	In the spring of 1935, I accepted the invitation of the Soviet Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries and took the troupe to the Soviet Union for a visit and performance. Before going abroad, I expressed my unwillingness to pass through Chinese land occupied by Japanese imperialists. The Soviet government specially sent the "Northern" special ship to pick us up, and we transferred to a train in Vladivostok to reach Moscow directly.
	There, we received a warm and enthusiastic welcome from the Soviet people and the literary and art circles. Drama experts organized a reception committee for us, including art masters such as Stanislavsky, Nemirovich-Danchenko, and Eisenstein. We performed in Moscow and Leningrad for more than three weeks and hosted people from all walks of life at the Moscow Grand Theatre. After the performance, the comrades in the Soviet drama circle held many serious seminars with us to study the unique style of Chinese classical drama and affirmed its advantages, such as the diversity of hand gestures, the virtual actions of riding horses and rowing boats, and the performance method of combining singing and dancing. During this period, they also invited us to see many famous Soviet dramas such as "The Cherry Orchard," which gave us a lot of inspiration. All of this encouraged me and the members of the troupe. From that time on, I further realized the preciousness of our national artistic heritage, and thus realized how a country under the leadership of the Communist Party selflessly respects the artistic creation and achievements of all ethnic groups in the world. What I will always remember is the sincere and simple demeanor of the two old gentlemen, Stanislavsky and Danchenko, and their serious attitude towards artistic endeavors.
	At that time, imperialism often used slander to slander the Soviet Union and the Chinese Communist Party. We knew that these rumors were unreliable. However, I did not have specific knowledge of what the people under the leadership of the Communist Party were like. After this personal experience, I knew—I knew that only in a country under the leadership of the Communist Party can everyone fully have his own rights as a human being, and everyone can truly have the opportunity to develop his abilities. No matter who it is, as long as he makes a contribution to the people, he will definitely be respected. No one will erase the achievements of others, and there will be no exploitation of people. The Soviet people's spirit of loving the country, loving the party, and loving their careers deeply moved me.
	However, at that time, the Soviet Union was still in the second five-year plan period. The people across the country were vigorously practicing thrift, accumulating funds, and rapidly engaging in the construction of heavy industry. Therefore, people's lives were still relatively difficult. However, they treated guests from afar with thoughtfulness and generosity. The food we ate was very rich, and the place we lived was comfortable. People in our troupe received preferential treatment wherever they went. Once, a member of my troupe who was in charge of costumes went to a department store to buy things and queued up at the back. When the shop assistant saw him, he waved to him and sold him the things in advance. I was often accompanied by two Soviet comrades who could speak Chinese. They not only took care of my life but also paid attention to my safety. They said to me: "We still have 'red radishes' here (red radishes are red on the outside and white on the inside, which means that some people pretend to be progressive, but their hearts are unpredictable), so we must be vigilant." From this sentence, we can also see that the revolutionary cause cannot be separated from struggle, and we cannot relax for a moment.
	At the end of 1952, on my way to Vienna to attend the World People's Peace Congress, I passed through Moscow and Leningrad again and was hosted by the Soviet Peace Protection Committee to spend the Spring Festival of 1953, visiting and sightseeing for ten days. The Soviet Union at this time had greatly changed compared to what I saw in 1935. In Moscow, I saw the newly built Moscow University with more than 5,700 dormitories; the small houses on Gorky Street in the past have now become tall buildings; many artistic and magnificent stations have been added to the subway; the department store has long abolished the rationing system and is piled with various goods, allowing people to choose; the audience in the Grand Theatre are all dressed in neat and beautiful clothes, happily appreciating dramas with high ideological and artistic qualities.
	We had long heard about the destruction and suffering that Leningrad suffered in the Patriotic War. Now that we are on the scene, except for seeing a few bullet marks on the towering stone pillars of the triumphal arch, it has been restored and there is no trace of war wounds, and many new buildings have been added. I was even able to live in the hotel I used to live in. These impressions made me more deeply aware of the great power that the Soviet people have unleashed under the leadership of the Communist Party. The facts in front of us illustrate the superiority of the socialist system and encourage the broad masses of the socialist camp. And we are marching along the Soviet path, and we deeply feel that the Soviet Union's today is our tomorrow. We are most fortunate to live in this great socialist era, doing things that our predecessors have never done before, all of which are inseparable from the October Revolution led by the Soviet Communist Party.
	In recent years, the Soviet Union's construction has made even more rapid progress, and the people's living standards are still gradually improving. The emergence of jet airliners, the successful manufacture of intercontinental missiles, and especially after the first artificial satellite flew out, shocked the world, making the gentlemen who clamor for power politics generally lose color and scramble, greatly enhancing the power to defend world peace. The light of socialism shines all over the earth, and a big step has been taken in the scientific advancement journey.
	On the great festival commemorating the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution, I express my heartfelt words with great joy. Although I understood the principles of revolution very late, I was already influenced when I visited the Soviet Union twenty years ago. In my recent life, I have also been nurtured and educated by the Party and the state, especially in the practice of the eight years since liberation, which has improved my awareness. I am willing to work harder to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union's socialist cultural and artistic construction, to develop and create our nation's new socialist culture, and to better serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers.

    追忆苏联
    梅兰芳
    四十年前，伟大的革命导师——列宁，睿智地运用了马克思主义学说，建立了强大的苏联共产党，领导了惊天动地的十月社会主义革命，缔造了世界上第一个社会主义国家，那时中国正处于国际帝国主义重重压迫之下，在被称为东亚病夫的黑暗岁月里，许多忧国之士，想尽方法从日本、英、法各国去找寻救国良方，结果抓来的药，都治不了中国的病。一直等到十月革命的炮打响了，我们的革命先进者才找到了马列主义这张对证下药的良方，建立了中国共产党，从此踏着俄国人走过的道路，学习了苏联的好榜样，打倒了帝国主义和一切恶势力，推翻了一切不合理的剥削制度，拔掉了几千年来顽固无比的老病根，成立起崭新的中华人民共和国。在我们全国人民努力从事社会主义建设的时候，苏联又给予我国大力的支持和帮助，使我们的国家一天天强大结实，走向繁荣幸福的道路。
    中国解放以后，我在各地旅行演出，亲眼看到了苏联朋友对我们的帮助。
    1952年的春天，我到大连，正碰上中苏友好同盟互助条约签订的纪念日，又值苏联政府按照条约的规定将旅顺口军港基地的全部设备移交给中国的前夕，我们举行演出晚会招待苏联朋友，我向苏联的一位高级将官说：“这几年，苏联同志们把种种经验教给我们，使我们能够学会许多东西，这种友谊是真挚可贵的。”苏联朋友含着微笑对我说：“你们的干部都已长成了，我们走后，我相信他们能够担负起所有的责任”。
    我参加鞍钢三大工程开工典礼的时候，我听到工会主席对我说：“苏联专家在工作中，有时接到本国的电报，发明新的工作方法，他们立刻坐飞机回国，把新的方法带回来，因此，三大工程的设备，有些是他们尚未试用过的最新的方法。”
    长江大桥的钻孔法的发明，苏联专家在这方面的卓越成就，已是举世皆知的一个奇迹，无庸我来介绍。我去年三过武汉，看到大桥的迅速长成，在武昌演出时，我就住在大桥旁边，曾亲眼看到苏联同志在风雪严寒的季节里和工人们亲密工作的情形，最使我难忘的是有一次苏联专家来看我的戏，演毕，一位苏联女同志代表修建长江大桥的全体专家到台上献花，祝我艺术长春。我激动地对她说：“我很难找到恰当的言词，来表达我心里感谢的意思。我想，长江大桥的巨大建筑工程，象征着中苏两国人民友好合作的结晶，是社会主义花园里一朵友谊之花。”
    可以举的例子还很多，我无法一一叙述，下面我想谈一谈访苏的印象：
    我每次出国之前，在国内总听到一些不同的看法，个别的人对中国戏到外国舞台上去表演表示怀疑，因为他们对中国传统的戏剧遗产的估价是不高的。当二十年前我接到苏联对外文化协会的邀请书，我曾和熟悉国外情况的朋友讨论。他们认为苏联的文学、戏剧、音乐的水平很高，而我们的戏剧表演形式和苏联是并无相同之处的。同时社会主义国家的制度和我们又截然不同。中国戏能否为他们所接受和理解，是没有把握的。我当时虽然不懂马列主义的革命道理，但对上面的一番话，发生怀疑，我觉得尽管社会制度不同，而文化艺术的民族传统和风格的特色，是可以为他们所接受的。同时我又急于想看看在社会主义制度下人民的生活情况。另外，我也想把中国的戏剧表演艺术摆到他们那里衡量艺术的天秤上，秤一秤分量。
    1935年的春天，我接受了苏联对外文化协会的邀请，带着剧团到苏联作访问演出，在出国之前我曾表示不愿经过日本帝国主义者侵占下的中国土地。苏联政府特派了“北方号”专轮来接我们，经海参崴换乘火车直达莫斯科。
    在那里受到了苏联人民和文学艺术界的亲切热烈的欢迎。戏剧界的专家们为我们组织了招待委员会，其中包括斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基，聂米诺维奇—丹钦科，爱森斯坦因等艺术大师。我们在莫斯科、列宁格勒两个名城作了三星期以上的演出，并在莫斯科大剧院招待了各界人士。在演出之后，苏联戏剧界的同志们很认真地和我们在一起开了好多次座谈会，研究中国古典戏剧特有的风格，肯定了其中的优点，像对手势变化的多样性，虚拟的骑马、划船等动作，歌舞合一的表演法等等都加以分析和赞扬。在这期间，他们也招待我们看了很多的苏联名剧如“樱桃园”等，给了我们很多的启发。所有这一切都鼓舞着我和团员们。从那时候起我才更进一步认识到我们民族艺术遗产的宝贵，从而体会到在共产党领导下的国家是如何无私地尊重着全世界各族人民在艺术上的创造和成果。使我永久怀念的是斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基和丹钦科两位老先生那种诚恳、朴实的艺术家的风度和对待艺术事业的认真严肃的态度。
    当时，帝国主义对苏联和中国共产党常常用蜚语毁谤，这种谣言，我们知道是靠不住的。但是，共产党领导下的人民究竟是什么样子，我可没有这种具体的知识。经过这一次的亲身体验，我知道了——我知道只有在共产党领导下的国家里，每个人才能充分有他自己做人的权利，每个人才能真正有他发挥能力的机会，不论任何人，只要对人民有一分贡献，便一定能受到一分尊重，绝不会抹杀别人的功绩，更没有人剥削人的事。苏联人民那种热爱国家，热爱党，热爱事业的精神，深深地感动了我。
    不过，那时候的苏联还在第二个五年计划期间，全国人民正在厉行节约，积累资金，迅速地从事重工业的建设，因此人民在生活方面，还是比较艰苦的。但是，他们对待远方来的客人是招待周到、毫不吝惜的，我们吃的东西很丰富，住的地方也舒适。我们剧团的人走到那里都会受到优待。有一次替我管服装的一个团员到百货店里买东西，排队在后面，店员看见了，就对他招手，提前卖给他。我的身边经常有两位能讲中国话的苏联同志陪伴着我，他们不但照顾我的生活，还注意我的安全。他们对我说：“我们这里还有‘红萝卜’（红萝卜是红皮白心，这意思是说有个别的人伪装进步，其心难测），所以必须提高警惕。”从这句话里还可以看出革命事业离不开斗争，一刻也不能松懈。
    1952年的年底，我到维也纳参加世界人民和平大会的归程中，又经过莫斯科和列宁格勒，被苏联维护和平委员会招待度过了1953年的春节，参观、游览了十天。这时的苏联和我在1935年所见的情形相比，就大大地改变了面貌。我在莫斯科看到了新建的拥有五千七百多间宿舍的莫斯科大学；高尔基街过去的矮小房屋现在变成了高楼大厦；地下铁道添建了许多艺术性的华丽的车站；百货公司早已废除了配给制，堆满了各种货物，听人选购；大剧院的观众都穿着整齐、漂亮的衣服，愉快地欣赏着具有高度思想性和艺术性的戏剧。
    我们早就听到列宁格勒在卫国战争中所遭受的破坏和苦难，现在身历其境，除看到了凯旋门高耸入云的石柱上面有几点弹痕之外，已经恢复得看不到一丝战争创伤，并且还添了许多新的建筑物。我居然能够住在从前住过的旅馆里。这些印象使我更深一层认识到苏联人民在共产党领导下发挥了多么伟大的力量。摆在面前的事实，说明了社会主义制度的优越性，鼓舞了社会主义阵营的广大人民。而我们正沿着苏联的道路迈进，更深深地感觉到苏联的今天，就是我们的明天。我们最幸福的是生活在这伟大的社会主义时代里，正做着前人所没有做过的事，这些都和苏联共产党领导的十月革命分不开的。
    最近几年来，苏联的建设，更有飞跃的进展，人民的生活还在逐步提高。喷气客机的出现，洲际导弹制造成功，特别是第一颗人造卫星飞出以后，震动了全世界，使一般叫嚣实力政策的先生们，相顾失色，手忙脚乱，大大地增强了保卫世界和平的力量。社会主义的光芒普照着整个地球，在科学进军行程中，跨进了一大步。
    当纪念十月革命四十周年的伟大的节日里，我以十分欢跃的心情，说出我心里的话。我对革命的道理虽然领会得很晚，但我在二十年前访苏的时候，却已经受到了影响。在我近年的生活中，又受到党和国家的培养教育，特别是在解放八年的实践中，提高了我的觉悟。我愿更加努力地学习苏联的社会主义文化艺术建设事业的先进经验，来发扬创造我们民族的社会主义的新文化，更好地为工农兵服务。
