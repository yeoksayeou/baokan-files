    Yangtze River Bridge
    Ye Jianying
    Tortoise and Snake Mountains confront each other, for a thousand years the turbid waves rise high and empty, halberds broken and sand submerged, heroes exhausted, nowhere to be found. The sky sighs in admiration, immortals on earth, a long bridge soars, connecting the north, south, east and west without limit. Imagining the Milky Way, glancing askance at the Cowherd and Weaver Girl, truly they are surprised and jealous. Standing alone in the river's heart, watching the Wu Gorge and Wu Mountains, head in Wu, tail in Chu. Let you calmly point and gaze. The flowing water is indifferent, let it roll eastward.

    长江大桥
    叶剑英
    龟蛇对峙，千年浊浪排空起，折戟沉沙，英雄淘尽，都无觅处。天空叹服，地上神仙，长桥飞架，南北东西无限。遥想银河，斜窥牛女，端的乍惊还妒。江心独立，看巫峡巫山，头吴尾楚。任你从容指顾。流水不关情，让它滚滚东去。
