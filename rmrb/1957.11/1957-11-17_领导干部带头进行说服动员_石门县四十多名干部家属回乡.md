Xinhua News Agency News: In Shimen County, Hunan Province, government cadres are taking the initiative to mobilize their family members to return to their hometowns for production. Currently, over forty family members of cadres have been mobilized to return to the countryside. The Shimen County Party Committee originally had eleven cadre family members living in the government offices. After the cadres persuaded and mobilized them themselves, nine family members have returned to their hometowns.

Many leading cadres took the lead in mobilizing their family members to return to their hometowns. County Head Lü Dingyuan's wife originally engaged in production in the countryside. This summer, she came to see him from over a hundred miles away. After staying for a short time, Lü Dingyuan mobilized her to return to her hometown to avoid affecting production. Many members of the Shimen County Party Committee also took the initiative to mobilize their family members to return to their hometowns for production. Currently, out of the twenty-five county committee members, only two have family members living with them in the government offices. Out of the 162 district-level cadres in the county, only eight have family members who are not participating in labor production.

    领导干部带头进行说服动员
    石门县四十多名干部家属回乡
    新华社讯  湖南省石门县机关干部主动动员自己的家属回乡生产，目前已有四十多名干部家属被动员回乡。中共石门县委原有十一个干部家属住在机关里，经过干部自己说服动员以后，已有九个家属回乡。
    许多领导干部带头动员自己的家属回乡。县长吕定元的爱人原在农村中生产，今年夏天从百里外来看他，住了一个短时间以后，吕定元就动员她回乡，以免影响生产。许多中共县委委员也主动地动员自己的家属回乡生产。目前，在二十五个县委委员中，只有两个家属和干部一同住在机关里。在全县一百六十二个区委级干部中，只有八个家属没有参加劳动生产。
