    Speech by Andreyev at the Wuhan People from All Walks of Life Welcoming the Soviet Delegation
    Dear Comrades, our faithful friends!
    Our Soviet delegation extends its greetings to all of you present – representatives of various social organizations and enterprises – and, through you, to all the working people of Wuhan and Hubei Province. We convey to you the sincere wishes of all circles and all the working people of the Soviet Union, wishing you success in the cause of socialist construction.
    Comrades! Fifteen days ago, the Soviet people celebrated the 40th anniversary of the victory of the Great October Revolution. This is no ordinary festival. It is forty years of victory for the new, liberated labor system, a true triumph of the victorious socialist system.
    The 40th anniversary of the October Revolution is not only a great festival for the Soviet people but also an international festival for the working people of the world because the October Revolution opened up and paved the way to liberation not only for our people but also for the working people of the whole world. On the other hand, for those capitalists who are still exploiting the working people, the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution is a crushing defeat for capitalism.
    When our working class, under the leadership of the Bolshevik Party and the great Lenin, was preparing for an armed uprising to seize power, representatives of the bourgeoisie, reactionary intellectuals, and bourgeois and petty-bourgeois parties clamored from all sides, saying that the working class and the Bolsheviks could not grasp power, let alone consolidate it, because the majority of the country, the peasants and the army, did not support the workers and the Bolsheviks. But as everyone knows, the armed uprising of the workers and soldiers of Petrograd was victorious within a day, and Soviet power, with the support of the peasants, was established throughout the country within a few days.
    Since that time, the power of the victorious people has been consolidating victoriously for forty years and has been constantly achieving success.
    When the power of capitalists and landlords was overthrown in October 1917 and replaced by the dictatorship of the proletariat, the domestic and foreign enemies of the young Soviet Republic asserted and hoped that the working people would not manage the state and factories after seizing power, that the workers and peasants did not have enough talent, knowledge, and culture to manage the state and factories, but they were greatly mistaken again.
    The Soviet people have overcome all difficulties in the past forty years to build a strong socialist country and have fundamentally transformed their country according to socialist principles.
    The Soviet Union has established a first-rate socialist industry, and the electrification of the country is developing rapidly; agriculture – collective farms and state farms – is also equipped with sophisticated technology.
    The current level of industry and agriculture has enabled the Soviet people to set the practical task of catching up with and surpassing the most developed country, the United States, economically in the next ten to fifteen years. Based on the most reliable estimates, we believe that the Soviet Union will definitely be able to accomplish this task.
    Countless enemies of the Soviet regime, in order to oppose the young Soviet Republic, forced the people to engage in civil war and established blockades from all sides. They falsely accused the Soviet regime and the Bolsheviks of being destroyers of culture and barbarians. But forty years have passed, and now even our slanderers have to admit the great progress of the Soviet Union in science, technology, and culture.
    Not only that, but they also have to admit their own backwardness and admit that the technological progress of the Soviet Union is far superior to that of capitalist countries.
    Now our country has very excellent scientific and technological cadres and countless scientific research institutions, which have made great changes in many scientific and technological fields such as atomic energy, jet technology, and aviation. Soviet science has entered interplanetary space, successfully launching two artificial earth satellites, thus opening up a new era for mankind to conquer nature.
    In terms of culture, the Soviet Union has completely eliminated illiteracy and has begun to transition to universal secondary education for young people. Our country has cultivated a large army of intellectuals. The victorious socialist system has not only inherited all the great heritage of human culture but has also established a new type of socialist culture, which is beyond the reach of bourgeois culture.
    As everyone knows, the imperialists have launched military attacks against the Soviet people more than once, attempting to eliminate the first socialist country in the world, but each time they were battered and bruised, and the Soviet armed forces have proven themselves to be superior to the armies of the top capitalist countries more than once.
    When the Great October Revolution was victorious, our enemies predicted that we would inevitably fail because we were in a state of isolation. But they had to be greatly disappointed once again, because the October Revolution received the support of the international proletariat from the very beginning.
    Now there are twelve countries with a population of 700 million that are advancing along the socialist road together with the Soviet Union, including the great Chinese people.
    This is the most important summary of the forty years since the October Revolution. It shows how great the strength of the people is, and how great things the people, liberated from capitalist oppression, can do.
    Dear Comrades! We have been staying in the land of the People's China for more than two weeks, and we have participated in the celebrations of the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution in your capital, Beijing. During this period, the delegation has visited many cities in your beautiful country, visited many factories and agricultural cooperatives, and had many meetings with workers, peasants, intellectuals, and young people.
    Wherever we go, what we first see and feel is the spiritual and political unity of the entire Chinese people, as well as the Chinese people's wholehearted and enthusiastic desire to carry out socialist transformation of their country. Everywhere we see the indomitable spirit and unyielding efforts shown by the working people in all walks of life to achieve this goal quickly.
    Everywhere, we feel the people's trust in the Chinese Communist Party and the Party's great prestige among the masses, and see the Party's leading role in all undertakings.
    Finally, one thing that particularly moves our delegation is the sincere friendship and love of the Chinese people for the Soviet Union. This is vividly manifested in the grand celebration of the 40th anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution by the Chinese people and the Chinese Communist Party on a grand scale.
    Let the great force of defending peace and building communism—the friendship between the people of our two countries—be further consolidated!
    Comrades! Today we would like to emphasize the great significance of the friendship between the two great nations of the Soviet Union and the People's China. The convergence of this force alone is enough to make the socialist cause completely invincible and world peace victorious.
    The friendship between the people of our two countries is based on the common foundation of socialist and communist ideas. The Sino-Soviet friendly alliance was cemented with the blood of the outstanding sons and daughters of our two countries as early as the October Revolution and our civil war.
    The friendly alliance between our two great nations was also formed in the common struggle of the Soviet and Chinese peoples against Japanese imperialism.
    This friendship between our two peoples was born in the flames of the struggle for common interests, and it is eternal and unbreakable.
    Comrades! The Soviet people are watching with great concern how the People's China is moving from backwardness to progress, and how it is moving towards the victory of socialism in all aspects of the economy, culture, and the people's material life.
    The Soviet people celebrate the achievements of their faithful friends and brothers, the Chinese people, with joy, and wish the Chinese people further achievements in the great cause of socialist construction.
    We know that these achievements of the Chinese people are the result of the leadership of the glorious Chinese Communist Party, the vanguard of the long-tempered Chinese working people.
    Dear Comrades! Please allow me to once again express to you our Soviet people's warm and heartfelt wishes, wishing you success in the great cause of building a new socialist China.
    Long live the great Chinese people and the glorious Chinese Communist Party!
    Long live the unbreakable friendship and cooperation between the Soviet and Chinese peoples!
    Long live world peace!

### 在武汉各界欢迎苏联代表团大会上  安德烈耶夫的讲话

    在武汉各界欢迎苏联代表团大会上
    安德烈耶夫的讲话亲爱的同志们，我们的忠实朋友们！
    我们苏联各界代表团谨向在座的诸位——各社会团体和企业代表们，并通过你们向武汉市和湖北省的全体劳动人民致意，向你们转致苏联各界和苏联全体劳动人民对你们的真诚的祝愿，祝你们在社会主义建设事业中获得成就。
    同志们！十五天以前，苏联人民庆祝了伟大十月革命胜利的四十周年。这是一个不平常的节日。这是新的解放了的劳动制度胜利的四十年，这是获得了胜利的社会主义制度的真正凯旋。
    十月革命四十周年不仅是苏联人民的伟大节日，而且是全世界劳动人民的国际节日，因为十月革命不仅为我国人民、而且也为全世界劳动人民开辟和铺平了走向解放的道路。另一方面，对于那些还在剥削劳动人民的资本家来说，十月革命四十周年却是资本主义的惨重失败。
    当我国工人阶级在布尔什维克党和伟大列宁的领导下，准备武装起义，夺取政权的时候，有资产阶级、反动知识分子、资产阶级和小资产阶级政党的代表们从各方面发出叫嚣说，工人阶级和布尔什维克不可能掌握政权，更谈不上巩固政权，因为国内大多数人、农民和军队都不支持工人和布尔什维克。但是大家知道，彼得堡工人和士兵的武装起义在一天内就取得了胜利，苏维埃政权在农民的支持下，几天之内就在全国范围建立起来了。
    从那个时候起，胜利了的人民的政权在四十年间一直胜利地巩固着，并且不断地获得成就。
    当资本家和地主的政权在1917年10月被推翻、并由无产阶级专政来代替的时候，年轻的苏维埃共和国的国内外敌人就断言，并且指望劳动人民在夺取政权以后不会管理国家和工厂，工人和农民没有足够的才干、知识和文化来管理国家和工厂，但是他们又大大地失算了。
    苏联人民四十年来克服了一切困难建立了强大的社会主义国家，并且按照社会主义的原则把自己的国家从根本上改造过来了。
    苏联建立了头等的社会主义工业，国家的电气化迅速地发展着；农业——集体农庄和国营农场也用精湛的技术装备起来了。
    现在所达到的工农业水平，使苏联人民已经能够提出在最近十年到十五年内，在经济方面赶上并超过最发达的国家——美国的实际任务。根据最可靠的估计，我们相信，苏联一定能完成这个任务。
    苏维埃政权的无数敌人为了反对年轻的苏维埃共和国，强使人民进行内战，从各方面建立封锁。他们诬指苏维埃政权和布尔什维克是文化破坏者和野蛮人。但是四十年过去了，现在就连污蔑过我们的敌人也不得不承认苏联在科学技术文化方面的巨大进步了。
    不但如此，他们还不得不承认自己的落后，不得不承认苏联的技术进步远比资本主义国家优越。
    现在我国拥有十分优秀的科学技术干部和无数科学研究机关，他们在原子能、喷气技术、航空等许多科学技术领域中作出了伟大的变革。苏联科学进入了星际空间，顺利地发射两颗人造地球卫星，从而开辟了人类征服大自然的新纪元。
    在文化方面，苏联已经全部消灭了文盲，并开始过渡到对青年进行普遍的中等教育。我国已培养出一支人数众多的知识分子大军。胜利了的社会主义制度不仅继承了人类文化的一切伟大遗产，而且建立了新型的社会主义文化，而这是资产阶级文化所不可望其项背的。
    大家知道，帝国主义者曾经不止一次地对苏联人民发动了军事进攻，企图消灭世界上第一个社会主义国家，但是每次都碰得焦头烂额，而苏联的武装力量已不止一次地证明了自己比头等的资本主义国家军队还要优越。
    当伟大的十月革命取得胜利的时候，我们的敌人曾经预言我们因为处于孤立地位，不可避免地要遭到失败。但是他们不得不又一次地大失所望，因为十月革命一开始就得到了国际无产阶级的支持。
    现在和苏联一起沿着社会主义道路前进的还有七亿人口的十二个国家，其中就包括有伟大的中国人民。
    这就是十月革命以来四十年的最主要的总结。它说明了人民蕴藏着多么伟大的力量，说明了从资本主义压迫下解放出来的人民能够做出多么伟大的事业。
    亲爱的同志们！我们在人民中国的土地上已经逗留了两个多星期了，我们曾经在你们的首都——北京参加了十月革命四十周年的庆祝活动。在这个期间，代表团到过你们美丽国家的许多城市，访问过许多工厂和农业合作社，跟工人、农民、知识分子和青年作过许多次的会见。
    无论我们到什么地方，我们首先看到和感觉到的，是整个中国人民在精神上和政治上的团结一致，以及中国人民全心全意地为自己的国家进行社会主义改造的热烈愿望。我们到处都看到各行各业的劳动人民为了迅速地达到这个目标所表现的顽强精神和百折不挠的努力。
    在任何地方，我们都感到人民对中国共产党的信任和共产党在群众中的巨大威信，看到党对一切事业的领导作用。
    最后，还有一点是特别使我们代表团感动的，这就是中国人民对于苏联的真挚友情和热爱。这一点鲜明的表现在，中国人民和中国共产党以一场盛大的规模隆重地庆祝十月社会主义革命四十周年。
    让保卫和平建设共产主义的伟大力量——我们两国人民之间的友谊进一步巩固吧！
    同志们！今天我们想特别强调一下苏联和人民中国这两大民族之间友谊的巨大意义。仅仅是这种力量的汇合，就足以使社会主义事业完全不可战胜，世界和平得到胜利。
    我们两国人民的友谊是建立在社会主义和共产主义思想的共同基础之上的，苏中友好同盟是远在十月革命和我国内战时期用我们两国人民优秀儿女的鲜血凝结起来的。
    我们两大民族之间的友好同盟也是在苏中两国人民反对日本帝国主义的共同斗争中结成的。
    我们两国人民的这种友谊，是在为了共同利益而进行的斗争火焰中诞生的，她是永恒的和牢不可破的。
    同志们！苏联人民以伟大的关怀注视着人民中国怎样从落后走向进步，怎样在经济、文化和人民的物质生活各个方面走向社会主义的胜利。
    苏联人民以愉快的心情庆祝自己忠实的朋友和兄弟——中国人民的成就，并祝中国人民在社会主义建设的伟大事业中获得进一步的成就。
    我们知道，中国人民所取得的这些成就，是由于久经锻炼的中国劳动人民的先锋队——光荣的中国共产党领导的结果。
    亲爱的同志们！请允许我再一次地向你们表达我们苏联人民热烈的和衷心的祝愿，祝你们在建设新的社会主义中国的伟大事业中获得成就。
    伟大的中国人民和光荣的中国共产党万岁！
    苏中两国人民牢不可破的友谊和合作繁荣万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
