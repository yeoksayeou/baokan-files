Xinhua News Agency, November 7th: The people of the capital reached the climax of their celebrations for the 40th anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution on the 7th, with approximately 500,000 people holding a grand mass celebration in Tiananmen Square.

Festive lights outlined the Tiananmen Gate and surrounding tall buildings with pearl-like, glittering borders. The square was illuminated like daylight by spotlights, and searchlights and fireworks embroidered the sky like a colorful curtain. The jubilant crowd extended from Tiananmen Square in all directions to Zhongshan Park, the Working People's Cultural Palace, Zhengyangmen, and East and West Chang'an Avenue. On this area of approximately 200,000 square meters, workers, suburban farmers, students, citizens, government officials, and officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stood shoulder to shoulder, singing and dancing joyously.

Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, Zhu De, Chen Yun, and Peng Zhen, together with members of the Soviet delegation from all walks of life participating in the Chinese people's celebration of the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution, headed by Andreyev, and the Soviet Embassy's Chargé d'Affaires ad interim to China, Gutikov, ascended the Tiananmen Gate to watch the mass celebration.

Also watching the celebration from the Tiananmen Gate and the viewing stands were heads of central and Beijing municipal departments, members of various Soviet delegations invited to visit China, Soviet experts and their wives helping China with its construction, foreign envoys and their wives stationed in China, Soviet and other foreign experts and their wives, and Soviet and other foreign guests currently visiting China, totaling more than 5,000 people.

More than 15,000 workers formed over 20 dance circles in the square, celebrating wildly. Textile workers, while dancing the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Dance," rhythmically shouted, "Long live Sino-Soviet friendship!" In the railway workers' dance circle, composed of veteran "February 7th" workers and advanced producers, railway workers performed a lion dance.

In the center of the square, workers from the Qinghe Woolen Mill and the Beijing Woolen Textile Factory played the "Horse Racing" game. Four workers rode "horses," carrying the workers' festive greetings from "Beijing" to "Moscow." When young worker Wu Chenglu was the first to arrive at the "Kremlin," he jumped up with joy, and people ran over to surround him, shaking his hand and congratulating him.

In front of the Monument to the People's Heroes, handicraft workers performed over twenty ethnic dances, martial arts, and other programs. As the magic show began, six white doves flew out of an empty square box in an instant. Then, a string of bright nine-linked lanterns appeared, with the words "Celebrating the 40th Anniversary of the October Revolution" written on them.

More than 30,000 college students formed dance circles one after another. Viewed from above, there were dancing crowds everywhere. In front of Jinshui Bridge, drums rumbled, and two colored dragons rolled along with the sound of the drums. In the dance circle of the Central Institute for Nationalities, young people from various ethnic regions performed wonderful songs and dances.

Another dance circle erupted in enthusiastic applause as students from the Beijing Institute of Technology sang their newly learned Soviet song, "The Party's Banner." They sang in unison: "The glorious October of Lenin, it is the foundation of our Party, the bright red flag, forever radiating golden light like the sun!"

The more than fifty students of the "Paul Class" of Beijing No. 25 Middle School seemed particularly happy tonight. Dressed neatly, with class badges bearing Paul's image hanging on their chests, they celebrated and danced wildly to the song "Moscow-Beijing."

At this moment, Soviet expert Gribenyuk from the Ministry of Foreign Trade, with a head full of white hair, had just stepped into the dance circle of Peking University when he was immediately surrounded by a group of female students who congratulated him and greeted him. The expert said to the college students: "Tonight's joy is just like I am in Moscow." The brass band played dance music, and the expert danced ballroom dance with the female students, talking and laughing.

Soviet folk dances could be seen frequently in the programs performed by the people. Here was the Kazan Tatar Dance, there was the Potato Harvest Dance, and elsewhere was the Latvian Dance. Many of these dances were learned temporarily.

People watching the celebration on the Tiananmen Gate were also in high spirits, repeatedly congratulating each other and their Soviet guests. During the break, Premier Zhou Enlai congratulated Chairman Andreyev and all members of the delegation on the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution and the successful launch of the artificial satellite.

Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, Zhu De, Chen Yun, Peng Zhen, and others all toasted Chairman Andreyev and all members of the delegation.

The joyous enthusiasm of the people in the square and the beautiful night scene attracted all the Soviet and foreign guests on the viewing platform. Some danced to the music, some softly sang the song "Moscow-Beijing," some held cameras to choose wonderful shots, and some ran to the square to celebrate with the masses. Almost all of the Soviet middle school students came, jumping and skipping on the viewing platform, singing and dancing. Romanian expert Diaconiscu described his feelings about participating in this grand evening to the Chinese comrades who came with him, saying: "The great October Revolution has brought youthful vitality to both the Romanian and Chinese people."

Soldiers of the People's Liberation Army could be seen everywhere in the joyous crowd. Members of the Cultural Troupe of the Tibet Military Region performed Chamdo folk dances and Lhasa tap dances, and the acrobatic team of the General Political Department Cultural Troupe also performed wonderful programs.

Farmers who came from Nanyuan Town, more than thirty miles away, to participate in the celebration also performed Huangmei Opera and folk song choruses.

People expressed their joy in a variety of ways, not only dancing and singing, but also skipping rope, playing hide-and-seek, and guessing words. A group of children wearing red scarves sat in a circle, looking at the laughing people around them, smiling and clapping their hands while singing the song "Socialism is Good."

Countless fireworks shells rushed into the sky with deafening sounds, and fireworks transported from Shandong, Fujian, Luoyang, and other places were set off simultaneously. The fireworks changed in a thousand ways in the night sky, like a myriad of flowers vying for beauty, and silver snakes dancing. At this time, the crowds boiling in Tiananmen Square looked up and cheered, congratulating Sino-Soviet friendship for ten thousand years. (Attached pictures)

    为革命佳节而高歌　为中苏友好而欢舞
    首都五十万人昨晚热烈联欢
    新华社7日讯　首都人民庆祝十月社会主义革命四十周年的活动7日达到了顶点，约五十万人在天安门广场举行了盛大的群众联欢晚会。
    节日的电灯把天安门城楼和周围高大建筑物镶起珍珠般晶莹的边框，广场被聚光灯照耀得如同白昼，探照灯光和礼花把天空绣成采幕。狂欢的人群以天安门广场为中心向四方延伸到中山公园、劳动人民文化宫、正阳门和东西长安街。在这约二十万平方公尺的地面上，工人、郊区农民、学生、市民、机关干部和解放军官兵肩踵相接，歌舞欢腾。
    刘少奇、周恩来、朱德、陈云、彭真同以安德烈耶夫为首的苏联各界参加中国人民庆祝十月革命四十周年纪念代表团人员，和苏联驻我国大使馆临时代办顾悌克夫，登上天安门城楼观看了群众联欢晚会。
    在天安门城楼和观礼台上观看联欢晚会的，还有中央和北京市各部门的负责人，应邀来我国访问的苏联各个代表团人员，帮助我国进行建设的苏联专家和夫人，各国驻华使节和夫人，苏联和各国的专家和夫人，正在我国访问的苏联和各国外宾，共有五千多人。
    一万五千多名工人在广场上围成二十多个舞圈狂欢着。纺织女工一面跳着“中苏友好舞”，一面有节奏地喊着“中苏友好万岁！”。在“二七”老工人和先进生产者组成的铁路工人舞圈里，铁路工人演出了狮舞。
    广场中间，清河制呢厂和北京毛纺织厂的工人玩着“赛马”游戏，四个工人骑着“马”，把工人们节日的祝贺从“北京”带到了“莫斯科”。当青年工人吴成禄第一个赶到“克里姆林宫”时，他高兴得跳起来，人们跑来围着他，向他握手祝贺。
    在人民英雄纪念碑前面，手工业工人表演了二十多个民族舞蹈、武术等节目。魔术开始了，刹那间，从一个空的方箱子内，飞出了六只白鸽。接着，变出了一串光亮的九联灯，上面写着“庆祝十月革命四十周年”。
    三万多名高等学校学生排开了一个连一个的舞圈。从高处望去，到处是翩翩起舞的人群。金水桥前鼓声隆隆，两条采龙随着鼓声翻滚。在中央民族学院的舞圈里，来自各民族地区的青年表演了精采的歌舞。
    另一个舞圈里也爆发出了热烈的掌声，北京工业学院的学生们唱起了他们新学会的苏联名歌——
  “党的旗帜”。他们齐声唱道：“光辉的列宁的十月，它是我们党的基础，鲜艳的红旗，永远像太阳在放射金光！”
    北京第二十五中学“保尔班”的五十多个学生，今晚显得特别高兴，他们穿戴整齐，胸前挂着镌有保尔像的班徽，随着“莫斯科—北京”的歌曲狂欢起舞。
    这时候，满头白发的对外贸易部苏联专家格里别纽克刚踏进北京大学的舞圈，马上被一群女学生包围起来，向他祝贺问好。专家对大学生们说：“今晚的欢乐，真像我在莫斯科一样。”铜管乐奏起舞曲，专家同女学生边谈边笑地跳起了交谊舞。
    在人们表演的节目中，可以连连看到苏联人民的舞蹈。这儿是喀山鞑靼舞，那儿是土豆丰收舞，另外一处又是拉脱维亚舞。这些舞蹈很多都是临时学成的。
    在天安门城楼上观看联欢晚会的人们，也兴高采烈，他们屡屡和苏联客人互相祝贺。在休息的时候，周恩来总理为十月革命四十周年和人造卫星的发射成功，向安德烈耶夫团长和全体团员表示祝贺。
    刘少奇、周恩来、朱德、陈云、彭真等都和安德烈耶夫团长和全体团员干杯。
    广场上人们欢乐的热情和美丽的夜景，把观礼台上所有苏联和各国外宾都吸引住了，他们有的随着乐曲起舞，有的小声唱着“莫斯科—北京”的歌曲，有的举着照相机选择精采的镜头，有的跑到广场上去和群众一起狂欢。苏联中学的学生们差不多都来了，他们在观礼台上跳跳蹦蹦，一会儿唱歌，一会儿跳舞。罗马尼亚专家迪亚康尼司古向同来的中国同志叙述自己参加这个盛大晚会的心情，他说：“伟大的十月革命给罗马尼亚人和中国人都带来了青春活力。”
    在欢乐的人群中到处可以看到人民解放军战士。西藏军区文工团的团员们，表演了昌都民间舞和拉萨踢踏舞，总政文工团的杂技队也表演了精采的节目。
    从三十多里以外南苑镇赶来参加联欢的农民，也表演了黄梅戏和民歌合唱。
    人们表示自己欢乐的方法是多种多样的，不但有跳舞、歌唱而且有跳绳、捉迷藏、猜字。一群戴着红领巾的孩子，坐成一圈，看着周围欢笑的人们，一面笑着一面拍手唱着“社会主义好”的歌曲。
    无数支礼花弹在震天的响声中冲向天空，从山东、福建、洛阳等地运来的焰火同时燃放起来。礼花和焰火在夜空中千变万化，好像万花争艳、银蛇飞舞。这时，沸腾在天安门广场的人群仰首欢呼，祝贺中苏友好万万年。（附图片）
