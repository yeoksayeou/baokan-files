The Chinese people and the people of the world are celebrating the 40th anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution with extraordinary excitement and joy. These forty years have been the most extraordinary forty years. Forty years may not seem very short to the average person, but it is only a very brief moment in the entire history of mankind. However, these forty years are a very important historical stage, different from any historical era in the past, and have become the greatest period in human history. This period has had a decisive influence on the entire course of world history and the fate of all mankind. In these forty years, every page of history vividly records one brilliant victory after another in the cause of human liberation. First, on one-sixth of the earth's land, the phenomenon of human exploitation of man was ended, social and national oppression was eliminated, and the first new country without classes, without exploitation, and without oppression appeared, opening a new era in human history and pointing out the common road to complete liberation for the oppressed classes and oppressed nations of the world. It inevitably led to the complete collapse of decadent capitalism and imperialism, while vigorous socialism and communism will inevitably triumph throughout the world. Obviously, the victory of the October Revolution is not only the victory of the Soviet Union, but the common victory of the people of the world. Up to now, the great victory of socialism has been achieved in the area accounting for one-third of the world's population, and triumphant songs have been played in the vast areas of Europe and Asia, and this triumphant jubilation is spreading to every corner of the world at a rapid pace, attracting more and more people of all ethnic groups in the world to the bright road pointed out by the October Revolution, year after year. The October Revolution is forever the banner of human happiness and world peace. The Chinese people, like the Soviet people and the people of the world, regard the October Revolution as their most glorious and greatest festival, and cheer for the Soviet Union's great contribution to defending world peace and promoting the cause of human liberation over the past forty years: Glory belongs to the heroic Soviet people who created a new life, and glory belongs to the Soviet Communist Party, the great organizer of socialism and communism!

On the eve of the worldwide celebration of the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution, the Soviet Union successfully launched the first artificial satellite, which is the best gift for this great festival. Isn't it attracting the eyes of residents all over the world and touching the heartstrings of hundreds of millions of people? It has brought joy and hope to mankind, and also dealt a fatal blow to American war-mongers. This great initiative of the Soviet Union not only marks the achievements of Soviet science and technology, but also undeniably demonstrates the victory of the October Revolution and the invincible Marxism-Leninism. These victories are the source of all the vigorous development of the Soviet Union, thus mastering advanced science and technology and constantly achieving a leading position. In recent years, the Soviet Union has created a series of world-shaking miracles: in 1954, it built the world's first atomic power station; last year, it manufactured the world's first "Tu-104" jet airliner; and this year, it launched the world's first intercontinental ballistic rocket missile... However, these are only a part of the Soviet Union's brilliant achievements. Its rapid development in industry and agriculture, and the unprecedented surge in the people's material and cultural living standards, all standing at the forefront of the world, are not these facts obvious to everyone? In just forty years since the October Revolution, it has far surpassed the achievements of old capitalist countries in hundreds of years. These ironclad historical facts demonstrate the infinite vitality of Marxism-Leninism and the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system. Without the victory of the October Revolution, without the leadership of the Soviet Communist Party, without the socialist system, without the dictatorship of the proletariat, and without the alliance of workers and peasants and the unity of all ethnic groups, the Soviet Union's economic and cultural development could never have been so rapid and brilliant.

It must be emphasized that the great achievements of the Soviet Union are countless, and the hard and painstaking struggle of the Soviet people is also countless. If we want to ask where the happy life of the Soviet people today comes from? This can only be found in their arduous struggle, hard work, and overcoming difficulties. The Soviet Union's today is our tomorrow. At the same time, we should not forget the Soviet Union's yesterday. In the winter of 1927, I went to the Soviet Union for the first time and witnessed the Soviet people tightening their belts, enduring hardships, and investing every ruble in the cause of national construction. Every Soviet man and woman filled me with great admiration. Learning from the Soviet Union must not abandon the arduous journey of this great country in building the country through diligence and thrift. People cannot forget that before the October Revolution, Russia was a poor and backward country. After the October Revolution, it suffered more than three years of destruction from internal and external troubles. The Soviet people overcame enormous difficulties with unprecedented courage and changed the face of Russia. When the third five-year plan was about to be completed, it was invaded by fascist Germany. At that time, I was also in the Soviet Union and witnessed the patriotic heroism and hard-working spirit displayed by the Soviet people during the arduous years of the Great Patriotic War. Many moving heroic struggles and arduous struggles emerged, which gave me an unforgettable and profound impression. The Soviet people finally overcame serious difficulties, won the final victory, defeated the Hitler bandit army, weakened the capitalist world, saved the people of Europe and Asia, and helped the people in vast areas enter the socialist family. This was a battle related to the fate of mankind. Can it be imagined that the victory of the anti-fascist war in World War II could have been achieved without the heroic struggle of the Soviet people? After the war, the Soviet people quickly healed the heavy wounds of the war, rebuilt a happy paradise from the ruins, and strode forward to communism. The revolutionary spirit of the Soviet people in overcoming difficulties and forging ahead, and the advanced experience of building the country through diligence and thrift, are our brilliant examples, forever encouraging us to build a new China with full confidence.

As I celebrate the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution, I think of Mr. Sun Yat-sen, the pioneer of the Chinese revolution, who devoted himself to the National Revolution for forty years. In his deathbed testament, Sun Yat-sen said: "I have been devoted to the National Revolution for forty years, and its purpose is to seek freedom and equality for China." Like countless advanced Chinese people, Sun Yat-sen tirelessly searched for the truth in the West, but all ended in failure. Even a national movement like the Xinhai Revolution failed. It was not until his later years that he found the truth, which was "to take Russia as a teacher." As Chairman Mao pointed out in "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship": "Sun Yat-sen met the October Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party in despair. Sun Yat-sen welcomed the October Revolution, welcomed the Russian people's help to the Chinese people, and welcomed the Chinese Communist Party to cooperate with him." It was precisely in this way that Sun Yat-sen, encouraged by the October Revolution and with the help of the Soviet Union and the Chinese Communist Party, unswervingly "took the road of the Russian people." However, he had just found this bright road when he died before he could witness the victory of the Chinese people's revolution. Therefore, Sun Yat-sen said in his will: "The revolution has not yet succeeded, and comrades still need to work hard." He had to tell future generations the experience he had accumulated over the years: "With forty years of experience, I deeply know that to achieve this goal, we must awaken the masses and unite with the nations of the world that treat me equally to fight together." Chairman Mao further developed this conclusion and summarized it into two things: first, to unite the people of the whole country to form a domestic united front and establish a people's democratic dictatorship; second, to unite with the Soviet Union to form an international united front. Sun Yat-sen also said in his "Letter to the Soviet Union" on his deathbed: "I hope that dawn will break soon. At that time, the Soviet Union will welcome a strong and independent China as a good friend and ally. The two countries will join hands and advance together to achieve victory in the great war for the freedom of the oppressed nations of the world." Sun Yat-sen's proposition of "taking Russia as a teacher" and his hopes in his "Will" and "Letter" have all been fully realized today. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and with the sincere and selfless great assistance of the Soviet Union, the Chinese people have already achieved great victories in the democratic revolution, the socialist revolution, and socialist construction along the road of the October Revolution. However, this victory was achieved through tortuous and arduous struggles. When I talk about Sun Yat-sen's forty years of dedication to the National Revolution, I feel that Sun Yat-sen's perseverance, unyieldingness, and spirit of fighting for the liberation of the motherland can be compared with the spirit of hard struggle of the Soviet people in the forty years after the October Revolution. However, the Soviet Union has one victory after another, while Sun Yat-sen inevitably suffered many failures. Why is this? There are many reasons, and I think there is no need to elaborate. I will only say one point here. Sun Yat-sen more than once investigated the reasons for his revolutionary failure and the success of the Soviet revolution, eager to learn from the successful experience of the Soviet revolution. He was jubilant about the victory of the October Revolution. In his "Fourth Lecture on Nationalism," he said: "With the Russian revolution, mankind in the world has gained great hope." He especially admired the great revolutionary teacher Lenin, praising Lenin in his "Speech on the Death of Lenin" as "a great success in the revolution, a saint in the revolution, and the best model in the revolution." Therefore, he spared no effort to learn the Russian method. In his speech "Success Depends on Party Members, Not Just on the Army," he pointed out: "If we want the revolution to succeed, we must learn from the Russian methods, organization, and training in order to have the hope of success." Not only should the organization and training learn from the Russian methods, but also in preventing the enemy from carrying out sabotage activities from within, we must learn from the Russian good methods. This is very relevant to the current anti-Rightist struggle. Sun Yat-sen told a story in "The Question of Reorganizing the Kuomintang": "A revolutionary comrade in Russia once said to me that the cleverness and ability of the Chinese counter-revolutionaries are beyond the reach of the Russian counter-revolutionaries. The Russian counter-revolutionaries are bureaucrats and intellectuals. When the revolutionaries launched an attack, they all fled to foreign countries, so the Russian revolutionaries could succeed. However, the Chinese counter-revolutionaries are extremely clever. Not only do they not escape, but they also join, and eventually destroy the revolutionary cause... The Chinese revolutionaries do not have much experience, so they let the opposition parties use their skills to the fullest. There is no good Russian method to prevent the counter-revolutionaries from sabotaging from within. Therefore, Russia succeeded six years later than us, while we failed even though we started the revolution six years earlier." Isn't that right? Just look at the current Rightists, they are really "extremely clever." They outwardly support socialism and the Communist Party, but secretly sabotage socialism and attempt to seize the leadership of the Communist Party. What is the difference between this and the behavior of taking advantage of the opportunity to sabotage from within that Sun Yat-sen pointed out? On the eve of the celebration of the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution, we have widely launched the anti-Rightist struggle and have already achieved a decisive victory. This is precisely to learn "the good Russian method to prevent the counter-revolutionaries from sabotaging from within." This not only powerfully shattered the political conspiracy of the bourgeois Rightists to oppose the Soviet Union, oppose the Communist Party, and oppose socialism, but will also make us more convinced that only by taking the socialist road under the leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party, only by being good at learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, and only by being good at learning the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism that is applicable everywhere, can we better build our socialist motherland.

The forty years of the great October Socialist Revolution in the Soviet Union is the greatest period in human history. The wheels of history are always moving forward, especially under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism theory and under the light of the October Revolution. The Soviet people, together with the Chinese people and the peace-loving people of the world, will have more and greater new achievements. I imagine that the next forty years will be the last period of the 20th century. At that time, the Soviet Union will enter the fourteenth five-year plan, and China will also enter the ninth five-year plan. It can be believed that the Soviet Union will complete the construction of communism, and China will also enter a communist society. At that time, the problem of mankind conquering nature will be solved, the ideal of interstellar travel can be realized, and at the same time, it can be hoped that the society of human exploitation of man will completely disappear throughout the world, and mankind's material life and spiritual life can also reach a more beautiful and complete realm. Of course, this will require even greater and more efforts to achieve. I believe that the Soviet people will definitely be able to achieve it, and we can definitely achieve it as long as we work hard.

In order to safeguard the security of the motherland and defend world peace, and in order to build our own happy and beautiful life, we must unite more closely around the Chinese Communist Party, resolutely strive for greater victories on the production front, the political front, and the ideological front, further strengthen the fraternal friendship and unity between China and the Soviet Union, strengthen the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, strengthen the unity of the proletariat and peace-loving people of the world, hold high the banner of Marxism-Leninism, and advance victoriously along the road of the October Revolution!

    人类有史以来最伟大的四十年
    邵力子
    庆祝伟大的十月社会主义革命四十周年，中国人民和全世界人民都怀着异常兴奋的心情，欢欣鼓舞地来迎接这最光辉的节日。这四十年，是最不平凡的四十年；四十年在一般的人看来为时并不很短，但在整个人类历史中不过是很短暂的时刻。然而这四十年却是很重要的历史阶段，不同于过去任何一个历史年代，而成为人类有史以来最伟大时期。这个时期，对世界历史整个进程，对全人类命运都起了决定性的影响。这四十年中，每一页历史上都生动地写着人类解放事业一个接一个的辉煌胜利。首先在地球六分之一的土地上结束了人剥削人的现象，消灭了社会的和民族的压迫，出现了第一个没有阶级、没有剥削、没有压迫的新国家，开辟了人类历史的新纪元，指出了全世界被压迫阶级和被压迫民族彻底解放的共同道路。不可避免地导致腐朽的资本主义、帝国主义的全部崩溃，而生气蓬勃的社会主义、共产主义必然在全世界胜利。显然十月革命的胜利，不只是苏联的胜利，而是全世界人民的共同胜利。到现在，占全世界人口三分之一的范围内已取得了社会主义事业的伟大胜利，在欧洲和亚洲的广大地区奏起了高响入云的凯歌，并且这种胜利的欢呼正一日千里地普及到全世界每一个角落，一年多似一年地吸引着越来越多的世界各族人民奔向十月革命所指出的光明大道。十月革命永远是人类幸福与世界和平的旗帜。中国人民同苏联人民和全世界人民一样把十月革命视为自己最光荣最伟大的节日，为苏联四十年来对保卫世界和平与推进人类解放事业的巨大贡献而欢呼：光荣属于英雄的新生活创造者的苏联人民，光荣属于社会主义和共产主义的伟大组织者的苏联共产党！
    当着全世界人民热烈庆祝十月革命四十周年的前夕，苏联第一个成功地发射了人造卫星，这是这一伟大节日的最好礼品。它不是吸引着全世界居民的眼睛，叩动了亿万人民的心弦么？它给人类带来了欢乐和希望，也给予美国战争挑拨者以致命打击。苏联这一伟大的创举，不仅标志着苏联科学技术的成就，无可辩驳地显示了十月革命和战无不胜的马克思列宁主义的胜利。这些胜利是苏联一切蓬勃发展的泉源，因而掌握了先进的科学技术，不断取得了领先地位。最近几年，苏联创造了一连串的震动世界的奇迹：1954年建成了世界第一个原子能发电站，去年制成了世界第一架“图—104”喷气客机，今年在世界上发射了第一颗洲际弹道火箭导弹……然而这些只不过是苏联光辉灿烂的成就之一部分。他如工农业的飞跃发展，人民物质和文化生活水平的空前高涨，都站在世界上的最前列，难道不是大家有目共睹的事实吗？十月革命仅仅四十年工夫，就远远超过老牌资本主义国家百几十年的成绩。这些铁一般的历史事实，表明了马克思列宁主义的无限生命力，和社会主义制度的无比优越性。如果没有十月革命的胜利，没有苏联共产党的领导，没有社会主义制度，没有无产阶级专政，没有工农联盟和各族人民的团结，苏联经济文化决不可能有这样迅速的光辉的发展。
    必须着重指出，苏联的伟大成就是说不完数不尽的，同样苏联人民千辛万苦的奋斗历程也是说不完数不尽的。如果要问苏联人民今天的幸福生活从何而来？这只能在他们艰苦奋斗、辛勤劳动、克服困难的过程中求得答案。苏联的今天，就是我们的明天，同时我们不应忘记苏联的昨天。1927年冬天，我第一次到苏联，目击苏联人民节衣缩食、忍受艰苦，把每一个卢布都投到国家建设事业中去，每一个苏联男女都使我十分敬佩。学习苏联，决不能抛开这个伟大国家勤俭建国的艰苦历程。人们不能忘记十月革命以前，俄国是一个贫困落后的国家，十月革命以后又遭受三年多内战外患的破坏，苏联人民以前所未有的魄力战胜了巨大的困难，改变了俄国的面貌。第三个五年计划快要完成的时候，又受到法西斯德国的侵略，当时我又在苏联，目击苏联人民在伟大的卫国战争的艰苦岁月里所表现的爱国主义的英勇气概和刻苦精神，涌现出许多可歌可泣的英勇斗争和艰苦斗争的事迹，更给我不可磨灭的深刻印象。苏联人民终于克服了严重的困难，赢得了最后胜利，打垮了希特勒匪军，削弱了资本主义世界，拯救了欧亚两洲人民，并且帮助广大地区人民进入社会主义大家庭。这是一场关系人类命运的战斗，不能设想没有苏联人民的英勇奋战，而能在第二次世界大战中取得反法西斯战争的胜利？战后苏联人民迅速医治了沉重的战争创伤，从废墟上重建起幸福的乐园，又大踏步地向共产主义迈进。苏联人民克服困难勇往直前的革命精神和勤俭建国的先进经验，是我们的光辉榜样，永远鼓舞着我们信心百倍地去建设新中国。
    我在庆祝十月革命四十周年的时候，想起中国革命先行者孙中山先生的致力国民革命四十年。孙中山临终遗嘱中说：“余致力国民革命，凡四十年，其目的在求中国之自由平等。”孙中山同无数的先进中国人一样，不辞劳瘁地向西方寻找真理，可是结果都碰了壁，像辛亥革命那样全国规模的运动也失败了。直到他的晚年才找到了真理，就是“以俄为师”。诚如毛主席在“论人民民主专政”一文中所指出：“孙中山在绝望里，遇到了十月革命和中国共产党。孙中山欢迎十月革命，欢迎俄国人对中国人的帮助，欢迎中国共产党和他合作”。正是这样，孙中山在十月革命的鼓舞下，在苏联和中国共产党的帮助下，坚定不移地“走俄国人的路”。可是，刚找到了这条光明大道，竟来不及目睹中国人民革命的胜利而与世长辞。所以孙中山在遗嘱中说：“革命尚未成功，同志仍须努力”，他不得不把多年积累的经验告诉后人：“积四十年之经验，深知欲达到此目的，必须唤起民众，及联合世界上以平等待我之民族，共同奋斗。”毛主席进一步发展了这个结论，总结为两件事：其一，团结全国人民结成国内统一战线，建立人民民主专政的国家；其二，联合苏联结成国际的统一战线。孙中山在临终“致苏联遗书”中还说：“希望不久即将破晓，斯时苏联以良友及盟国而欢迎强盛独立之中国，两国在争世界被压迫民族自由之大战中，携手并进以取得胜利”。孙中山“以俄为师”的主张以及在“遗嘱”和“遗书”中的希望，今天都完全实现了，中国人民在中国共产党的领导下，在苏联真诚无私的伟大援助下，沿着十月革命的道路已经取得了民主革命、社会主义革命和社会主义建设的伟大胜利，然而这个胜利，是经过曲折的艰苦奋斗才获得的。我谈到孙中山的致力国民革命四十年，觉得孙中山的坚苦卓绝，百折不回，为祖国的解放事业而奋斗的精神，实可与苏联人民在十月革命后四十年中的艰苦奋斗精神相比美，可是苏联是一个胜利接着一个胜利，而孙中山不免许多次的失败，这是为什么呢？有许多原因，我想不必详论。这里只说一点。孙中山曾不止一次地追究自己革命失败和苏联革命成功的原因，渴望在苏联革命成功的经验中吸取教训，对于十月革命的胜利感到欢欣鼓舞，他在“‘民族主义’第四讲”中说：“有了俄国革命，世界人类便生出了一个大希望”。尤其对伟大的革命导师列宁推崇备至，在“列宁逝世演说”中称赞列宁“是一个革命之大成功者，是一个革命中之圣人，是一个革命中最好的模范”。故不惜千方百计来学习俄国的方法。他在“要靠党员成功，不专靠军队成功”的演说中指出：“吾等欲革命成功，要学俄国的方法、组织及训练，方有成功的希望”。不仅组织训练要学俄国的方法，在防范敌人从内部进行破坏活动，更要学俄国的好方法，这与目前正在进行的反右派斗争很有关系。孙中山在“国民党改组问题”中讲了一个故事：“俄国有个革命同志曾对我言，谓中国反革命派之聪明本事，俄国反革命派实望尘莫及。俄之反革命派为官僚与知识阶级，当革命党发难时，均相率逃诸外国，故俄国革命党能成功。而中国反革命派，聪明绝顶，不仅不逃避，反来加入，卒至破坏革命事业……中国之革命党经验不多，遂令反对派得尽其技，没有俄国那种好方法以防范反革命派，使其不能从中破坏。故俄国虽迟我六年革命，而已成功；我虽早六年革命，而仍失败。”可不是吗？试看现在的右派分子也真是“聪明绝顶”，他们表面上拥护社会主义，拥护共产党，而暗地里破坏社会主义，企图夺取共产党的领导权，这与孙中山所指出的乘隙而入从中破坏的行为有何区别呢？在庆祝十月革命四十年的前夕，我们广泛地展开反右派的斗争，并且已经取得决定性的胜利，正是学习“俄国那种好方法以防范反革命派，使其不能从中破坏”。这不只有力地粉碎了资产阶级右派分子反苏、反共、反社会主义的政治阴谋，并将使我们更确信唯有在伟大的中国共产党的领导下走社会主义道路，唯有善于学习苏联的先进经验，善于学习放之四海而皆准的马克思列宁主义普遍真理，才能更好地来建设社会主义的祖国。
    苏联的伟大十月社会主义革命四十年，是人类有史以来最伟大时期，历史车轮是永远前进的，尤其是在马克思列宁主义理论的指导下，在十月革命的光芒照耀下，苏联人民同中国人民和全世界爱好和平人民还会有更多更伟大的新成就。我设想今后的四十年，正是二十世纪最后时期，那时候的苏联将要进入第十四个五年计划，中国也将进入第九个五年计划，可以相信苏联将完成共产主义建设，中国也将进入共产主义社会，那时候人类征服大自然的问题会得到解决，可以实现星际旅行的理想，同时在全世界范围内也可以希望人剥削人的社会完全绝迹，人类物质生活和精神生活也可以达到更美好更圆满的境界。这当然还要需要更大更多的努力去实现，我相信苏联人民一定能够实现，我们只要努力，也一定可以实现。
    为了维护祖国安全和保卫世界和平，为了建设自己幸福美好的生活，我们必须更紧密地团结在中国共产党的周围，坚决争取生产战线上、政治战线上和思想战线上的更大胜利，进一步加强中苏两国兄弟般的友好团结，加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结，加强全世界无产阶级和爱好和平人民的团结，高举起马克思列宁主义的旗帜，沿着十月革命的道路胜利前进！
