Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 17th - State-owned theatrical troupes in Anhui Province are going to the countryside to perform for farmers. The Provincial Huangmei Opera Troupe and the Provincial Lu Opera Troupe have recently gone to Feixi and Feidong counties respectively to perform. A portion of the Provincial Lu Opera Troupe's actors will also go to Pinghu Farm in Jiashan County to perform. Other provincial state-owned theatrical troupes are also formulating plans for rural performances and rehearsing repertoire suitable for rural audiences.

The Anhui Provincial Bureau of Culture convened a meeting of heads of provincial state-owned theatrical troupes in early November to discuss performance work for workers, peasants, and soldiers. According to inspections, state-owned theatrical troupes have rarely performed in rural areas in the past four years. The meeting decided that each provincial state-owned theatrical troupe must perform in rural areas forty to sixty times each year, and within five years, the provincial state-owned theatrical troupes should perform in all counties of the province according to a plan. It also required state-owned theatrical troupes to inherit the fine traditions of the Liberated Area Cultural Work Troupes, pay attention to reducing scenery and props during rehearsals, and simplify luggage for rural performances. When performing in rural areas, actors should help farmers with production as an important method of ideological remoulding for actors.

    安徽国营剧团下乡演出
    新华社合肥17日电　安徽省国营剧团纷纷下乡为农民演出。省黄梅戏剧团、省庐剧团已在最近分别去肥西、肥东两县演出，省庐剧团还分出一部分演员，将要去嘉山县平湖农庄演出。其他省属国营剧团也正在制订下乡演出计划和排演下乡剧目。
    安徽省文化局在11月上旬召开省国营剧团团长会议，讨论了向工农兵演出工作。据检查，各国营剧团四年来很少去农村演出。会议决定今后每个省国营剧团每年必须到农村演出四十场到六十场，五年内省国营剧团要按照计划到全省各县演出。并要求各国营剧团继承解放区文工团的优良传统，在排演时注意减少布景、道具，简化行装，以便下乡演出。在农村演出时，演员要帮助农民生产。作为演员思想改造的重要方法。
