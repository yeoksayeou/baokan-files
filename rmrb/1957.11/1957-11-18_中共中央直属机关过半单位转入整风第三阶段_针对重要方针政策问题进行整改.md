Xinhua News Agency, 16th: Over half of the departments directly under the CCP Central Committee have entered the third stage of rectification. Many departments have decided to focus on rectifying issues concerning some of the Party's important guidelines and policies, and are determined to overcome shortcomings such as bureaucratism, subjectivism, and sectarianism in the Party's leading organs.

After studying the opinions raised by the masses, the Rectification Leading Group of the Organization Department of the CCP Central Committee decided to focus on resolving issues in cadre work, such as the system of cadre management; the issue of the cadre work line, especially studying how to implement the cadre work line stipulated by the Third Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee in the future; the issue of the stability and improvement of cadres, including cadre training; and the issue of cadre retirement. In addition, the work of recruiting new Party members will also be discussed. The Propaganda Department of the CCP Central Committee tentatively plans to focus on studying the Party's leadership over cultural and educational undertakings, how to form a contingent of intellectuals from the working class, and the inspection of major policies in propaganda work. The Rural Work Department of the CCP Central Committee decided to focus on examining the guidelines and policies of rural work, including the guidelines and policies in areas such as cooperativization, agricultural production, mountain area production, afforestation, water conservancy, and the construction of state-owned farms.

The general approach of the departments directly under the CCP Central Committee in the third stage of rectification is: leading cadres take the lead, fully mobilize the masses, consistently implement the spirit of extensive airing of views, and adopt various forms such as big-character posters and symposiums to conduct extensive debates.

Many departments, after entering the third stage of rectification, immediately took resolute and swift rectification actions, resolving problems that could be solved immediately. The staff of the Propaganda Department of the CCP Central Committee launched an extensive airing of views on the issue of sending staff down to lower levels, posted many big-character posters, and held several symposiums. Everyone responded to the Party's call and discussed many specific issues related to sending people down. For example, what difficulties will be encountered after going to the countryside and mountains, and how to solve them? At present, ideological problems such as fear of slow progress after going down, and fear of a hard life, have been largely resolved. Everyone believes that working and living with the working people after going down can temper the proletarian stand and the proletarian world outlook, and cultivate the hard-working and simple style that a socialist builder must possess. At the same time, it is possible to come into contact with reality, learn production knowledge and labor skills from the masses, and progress faster. Currently, more than 150 people in this department are prepared to go to the grassroots and rural areas. Staff of the Organization Department of the CCP Central Committee have also been holding meetings for days to discuss the reduction of institutions and the sending of staff to lower levels. Currently, 193 staff members have expressed their determination to go to the grassroots and to the labor front.

    中共中央直属机关过半单位转入整风第三阶段
    针对重要方针政策问题进行整改
    新华社16日讯　中共中央直属机关已经有一半以上的单位转入整风第三阶段。许多单位都确定，要针对党的一些重要的方针、政策问题，下决心进行整改，坚决克服党的领导机关的官僚主义、主观主义和宗派主义等缺点。
    中共中央组织部整风领导小组在研究了群众提出的意见以后确定，要着重解决干部工作方面的问题，如关于干部管理的体制；关于干部工作路线的问题，特别是研究今后如何贯彻党的八届三中全会所规定的干部工作路线；关于干部的稳定提高问题，包括训练干部问题；关于干部的退职退休问题。另外，还要讨论关于接收新党员的工作等问题。中共中央宣传部初步打算，着重研究党对文教事业的领导问题，工人阶级的知识分子队伍如何形成问题，宣传工作方面主要政策的检查问题。中共中央农村工作部确定，着重检查农村工作的方针政策，包括合作化、农业生产、山区生产、造林、水利以及国营农场的建设等方面的方针政策。
    中共中央直属机关在整风第三阶段一般的做法是：领导干部亲自动手，充分发动群众，自始至终贯彻大鸣大放精神，采用大字报、座谈会等多种形式，进行大辩论。
    许多单位在转入整风第三阶段以后，立即采取了坚决迅速的整改行动，能够解决的问题立即解决。中共中央宣传部的工作人员围绕工作人员下放问题展开大鸣大放，张贴了许多大字报，召开了多次座谈会，大家响应党的号召，同时讨论了许多有关下放的具体问题。例如，下乡、上山后有什么困难，如何解决。目前，怕下放后进步慢、怕生活苦等思想问题已大体解决。大家认为，下放后和劳动群众共同劳动，共同生活，可以锻炼无产阶级立场和无产阶级的世界观，养成一个社会主义建设者所必须具备的艰苦朴素作风。同时，可以接触实际，向群众学习生产知识和劳动本领，进步会更快。现在这个部已有一百五十多人准备到基层和农村去。中共中央组织部工作人员连日来也在召开会议，讨论紧缩机构和工作人员下放问题，目前已有一百九十三个工作人员表示决心到基层去、到劳动战线上去。
