Seventeen Days of Rectification

——Record of the High Tide of Airing Views in the Mineral Export Company of the Ministry of Foreign Trade

By our reporter Zheng Qimin

In Extraordinary Days

For nearly half a month, the staff of the Mineral Export Company of the Ministry of Foreign Trade have been living in extraordinary days, and almost everyone's heart is filled with excitement. Bao Xianfang, a cadre from the business division, worked hard all day, and tossed and turned in bed at night, unable to sleep. It was already twelve o'clock in the middle of the night, and he quietly put on his clothes, turned on the light, and leaned against the bed, writing and thinking. What was he writing? A draft of a big-character poster. He wanted to write down his opinions on the organizational structure of the company. Xie Wenjie, a cadre from the Second Division, was arguing with comrades in the dormitory, his face red and ears flushed, about whether the three business divisions could be merged. It was past ten o'clock in the evening, and Song Hongzhi was still posting big-character posters on the wall. The three cooks had been arguing for three days about whether the auditorium should be converted into a dormitory, and they had not yet reached a consensus.

After work and meals, the company's courtyard was always crowded with people, scrambling to see the colorful big-character posters that were posted every day. He Zizhi, a staff member of the company, said with deep feeling: "These days, big-character posters have become magnets. As long as you have a little free time, you will be attracted to them involuntarily." Yes, he was not exaggerating at all. At noon on October 25th, I personally saw many people eating their meals while reading the big-character posters. Some were probably so focused on reading that they even forgot to eat their meals.

Unlocking Ideological Knots

What made these big-character posters become "magnets" that attracted all the company's staff? Why could Bao Xianfang, who never liked to express his opinions in the past, now actively participate in the big airing of views and write big-character posters late into the night? Didn't the staff of this company have any ideological concerns about the third stage of the rectification movement? Of course not. In fact, some leading cadres and the masses in this company still had many ideological concerns when the rectification movement first entered the third stage. For example, some of the masses were afraid of being "rectified" for saying the wrong thing, afraid of retaliation, and afraid of being streamlined after the big debate. Some activists in the anti-rightist struggle were temporarily unable to understand the idea of ​​shifting to rectification and continuing to air views. As one activist said: "The anti-rightist struggle is a struggle between ourselves and the enemy, and I am willing to fight day and night. Now the rectification movement is to resolve internal contradictions, and I can't understand the idea of ​​writing big-character posters criticizing the leadership." Some leading cadres believed that there had already been enough airing of views, and whether it was a bit of an overreaction to continue to air views. Some leading cadres were also worried that continuing to air views would have side effects, and feared that this would lead to a loss of leadership prestige for leading cadres.

It seemed that if we did not first find a way to break through these ideological obstacles among the leading cadres and eliminate the ideological concerns of the masses and activists, it would be impossible to launch a relatively thorough high tide of airing views in the rectification stage. The rectification leading group of the company realized this, so when the company's anti-rightist struggle achieved a complete victory in early October, the rectification leading group promptly addressed the erroneous thinking of some leading cadres and raised the discussion topic of "Have the problems of the Mineral Company been fully exposed?" requiring all leading cadres to participate in the discussion. After several debates, most people believed that they had not been fully exposed and needed to continue to air views. However, some people suggested that the masses should not be allowed to say everything, and the leadership should impose some restrictions, preferably by the leadership first raising several questions and letting everyone debate around the questions. The discussion resulted in the rejection of this suggestion. Everyone unanimously agreed that all efforts must be made to mobilize the masses to air their views, and that only by allowing everyone to freely express what has been hidden in their hearts for a long time can rectification and reform be done well. After such a big debate, the thinking of the leading cadres gradually became consistent. At this time, the rectification leading group convened a meeting of all staff, on the one hand, commending the thirty-five activists who had performed the most actively and bravely in the anti-rightist struggle, calling on them to not only become the Party's "vanguards" in the anti-rightist struggle, but also to become brave warriors in helping the Party to eliminate the "three evils" of work style. On the other hand, it also analyzed and criticized the erroneous thinking of being soft on bureaucratic work style, unwilling to criticize, and unwilling to write big-character posters. Then, meetings of Party and League members and symposiums with activists were held to discuss the question of how Party and League members and activists should play an exemplary role in this big airing of views, correcting and eliminating their incorrect views and ideological concerns.

Launched a High Tide of Airing Views

After this series of organizational and publicity work, starting from October 12th, the company's rectification leading group used all methods to vigorously call on everyone to air their views widely and thoroughly, calling on Party members, League members, and activists to take the lead in posting big-character posters. On that day, Party members, League members, and activists posted forty-four sharply critical big-character posters. Gu Pinlu, a Communist Party member who had posted eighteen big-character posters to launch a fierce attack on rightists in the anti-rightist struggle, has now become a "vanguard" in helping the Party to eliminate the "three evils" of work style. In seventeen days, he posted fifteen big-character posters alone. Yan Yuan, an activist, after listening to the mobilization report on the transition to the third stage of the rectification movement, not only spoke actively in the group debates and wrote big-character posters, raising sixty-nine criticisms alone, but also actively mobilized comrades who were usually afraid to raise their opinions to give feedback to the leadership through individual talks and other methods. Under the impetus of these activists, many people who originally had ideological concerns have now gradually eliminated their concerns and begun to air their views boldly. For example, there was a typist in the company's administrative office who was initially very afraid and did not dare to speak at several group meetings, fearing that she would be "rectified" for saying the wrong thing. Later, when she saw that many people were enthusiastically posting big-character posters and criticizing the leadership, she also boldly exposed the relatively serious bureaucratic work style of the director of the administrative office. Now, the company's high tide of airing views has been launched, and the enthusiasm of the masses is very high. From October 12th to October 2nd, in this agency of less than two hundred people, eight hundred and two big-character posters have been posted, with two thousand one hundred and seventy-six suggestions of various sizes.

The wisdom of the masses is infinite. When you carefully look at the big-character posters of the Mineral Export Company, you will have a deeper understanding of this sentence. The company's big-character posters are not only numerous and cover a wide range of issues, but many of them are sharply critical, pertinent, and hit the nail on the head. Director Meng Renna sharply criticized the bureaucratic work style of Manager Shang, who was high above and unwilling to go deep into the grassroots, with the title "Why Has Manager Shang Not Left the City in Eight Years Since Entering the City?" Qi Yi, deputy section chief of the secretariat, satirized the company's nominal but ineffective four-level organizational structure and the abnormal phenomenon of more and more people being streamlined in the agency, with the title "Too Many Soldiers and Generals, Idly Panicking." There are many more big-character posters like this. These big-character posters are not only rich in content and sharply criticize the problems, but also come in various forms and use popular language.

Still Need to Climb to a Higher Level

The mass-based rectification fire of the Mineral Export Company has already been ignited. In seventeen days, the masses have put forward more than two thousand criticisms and suggestions to the leadership. In this situation, how to guide the movement to develop in a deeper, broader, and healthier direction is indeed a problem that needs to be solved urgently. To this end, I have twice visited the person in charge of the company's rectification leading group. According to him, the rectification leading group has held four consecutive meetings in the past three days, specifically to study this issue. They believe that first of all, the leadership must resolutely change and quickly change. They have conducted preliminary research on the two thousand one hundred and seventy-six suggestions put forward by the masses, and have synthesized those that should be changed and can be changed at present, and arranged the time for the changes. They plan to concentrate their efforts in the next week to improve 100 aspects of work. Secondly, they have summarized and sorted out three major issues based on the opinions of the masses, namely: various opinions on the organizational structure, cadre policy and personnel system, and welfare issues, and are preparing to print and distribute them to everyone for special debates.

    整风十七天
    ——记对外贸易部矿产出口公司的鸣放高潮
    本报记者　郑启民
    在不平常的日子里
    近半个多月来，对外贸易部矿产出口公司的工作人员，都生活在不平常的日子里，几乎每个人的心都在激动着。业务处干部鲍贤芳，白天工作了整整一天，晚上躺在床上翻来复去睡不着觉。已是午夜十二时了，他悄悄地披起衣服、开开电灯，靠在床边上一面写着一面想着。他在写些什么？草拟一篇大字报的底稿，他要写出他对该公司组织机构的意见。二处的干部谢文杰，在宿舍里面红耳赤地与同志们争论三个业务处能不能合并的问题。晚上十点多钟了，宋宏志还在墙壁上张贴大字报。三个炊事员为了大礼堂该不该改为宿舍的问题，已争论了三天，至今还没有取得一致的意见。
    在工余饭后，该公司的大院子里总是熙熙攘攘地挤满了人，争看每天新贴出来的五光十色的大字报。公司工作人员何子直深有所感地说：“这些天，大字报已成了吸铁石，只要你一有点闲空，身不由主地就被它吸来了”。是的，他这些话一点也不夸大，10月25日的中午，我也亲眼看到有许多人端着饭碗一面吃饭，一面看大字报，有的也许是看得太专心了吧，连饭都忘记吃了。
    解开了思想疙瘩
    是什么东西使这些大字报变成了吸引全公司工作人员的“吸铁石”呢？为什么过去一直不爱发表意见的鲍贤芳，现在能够积极参加大鸣大放，连夜赶写大字报呢？难道该公司的工作人员对第三阶段的整风运动就没有一点思想顾虑吗？当然不是这样，事实上这个公司的部分领导干部和群众在整风刚转入第三阶段的时候，思想上的顾虑还是很多的。如有些群众害怕说错了话“挨整”；怕打击报复；怕大争之后把自己精简掉等。还有些反右派斗争中的积极分子，听到要转入整风，而且还要继续鸣放，思想上一时搞不通。如一个积极分子说：“反右派是敌我斗争，要我夜以继日地反，我都心甘情愿，现在整风是解决内部矛盾，要我给领导上贴大字报，我思想上搞不通。”还有一些领导干部则认为已经鸣放得差不多了，再继续鸣放是不是有些小题大作？有的领导干部还担心继续鸣放会起副作用，害怕这样一来领导干部会丧失领导威信。
    看来，如果不首先想办法突破领导干部中这些思想障碍，不解除群众和积极分子中的思想顾虑，要想比较彻底地掀起整改阶段的鸣放高潮，显然是不可能的。该公司整风领导小组看清了这一点，因此，当10月上旬该公司的反右派斗争取得了彻底胜利，整风领导小组就及时地针对部分领导干部的错误思想，提出了一个“矿产公司的问题到底放透了没有？”的讨论题，要求所有领导干部参加讨论。经过几次争论，多数人认为没有放透，还需要继续鸣放。但又有人提出意见说，不要让群众什么都放，领导上要有所限制，最好领导上先提出几个问题让大家围绕着问题争鸣。讨论的结果，否定了这个意见。大家一致认为必须用尽一切力量发动群众鸣放，只有让大家毫无拘束地把久藏在心里的话都说出来，边整边改才能整好和改好。经过这样的一场大辩论，领导干部的思想逐渐取得了一致。这时整风领导小组又召开了全体工作人员大会，一方面表扬了三十五名在反右派斗争中，表现最积极、最勇敢的积极分子，号召他们不仅要成为反右派斗争中党的“尖兵”，同时也要成为帮助党清除“三害”作风的勇敢战士；另一方面也分析批判了对官僚主义作风表现心软，不愿提出批评，不愿写大字报的错误思想。接着又召开了党团员大会，和积极分子座谈会，分别讨论了党团员和积极分子在这次大鸣大放中如何起模范带头作用的问题，纠正和消除了他们的不正确看法和思想顾虑。
    掀起了鸣放高潮
    经过这一系列的组织工作和宣传鼓动工作以后，从10月12日开始，该公司整风领导小组就利用一切方法大张旗鼓地号召大家大鸣大放，号召党、团员和积极分子带头张贴大字报。当天就由党、团员和积极分子贴出了四十四张批评尖锐的大字报。反右派斗争中曾张贴过十八张大字报向右派分子展开猛烈攻击的共产党员顾品禄，现在已成了帮助党铲除“三害”作风的“尖兵”，十七天内他一个人贴出了十五张大字报。积极分子阎渊，听了整风转入第三阶段的动员报告之后，不但在小组辩论会上积极发言，写大字报，一人提出了六十九条批评意见，而且利用个别谈心等方式，积极动员平时有意见不敢提的同志向领导提意见。在这些积极分子的带动下，有许多原来思想上有顾虑的人，现在都逐渐解除了思想顾虑，开始大胆地鸣放了。如该公司行政处有个打字员，最初她心里非常害怕，在几次小组会上都不敢发言，怕说错了话“挨整”。后来，当她看到许多人都踊跃张贴大字报，向领导提出批评的时候，她也大胆地揭发了行政处处长的比较严重的官僚主义作风。现在该公司的鸣放高潮已经掀起了，群众热情十分高涨，从10月12日到10月2日在这个不到二百人的机关里，已经贴出了八百零二张大字报，提出了大小意见二千一百七十六条。
    群众的智慧是无限的。当你仔细观看了矿产出口公司的大字报之后，对于这句话就会有更深刻的体会。该公司的大字报不仅数量多，涉及的面广，而且许多大字报批评尖锐、中肯，能击中要害。处长孟仁呐以“商经理为什么入城八年未出过城”为题，尖锐地批评了这位经理高高在上不肯深入基层的官僚主义作风；秘书科副科长齐毅以“兵多将广，闲的发慌”为题，对该公司名废实存的四级制组织机构和机关中愈精简人员愈多的反常现象，进行了有力的讽刺。类似这样的大字报还有很多。这些大字报不仅内容丰富，问题提得尖锐，而且形式多样，语言通俗。
    还需更上一层楼
    矿产出口公司群众性的整风之火已经烧起来了，十七天中群众已经向领导上提出了两千多条批评和建议。在这种情况下怎样才能引导运动向更深和更广更健康的方向发展，确是一个急待解决的问题。为此，我曾两次访问该公司整风领导小组的负责人。据他谈，整风领导小组近三天来已经连续召开了四次会议，专门研究了这个问题。他们认为首先领导上要坚决地改，快快地改。他们对群众提出的二千一百七十六条意见已进行了初步的研究，将应当改而目前又能够改的进行了综合，并安排了改的时间，他们计划在最近一个星期内就要集中力量改进各种工作一百项。其次他们已经根据群众所提意见综合整理出三个重大问题，即：组织机构、干部政策和人事制度、生活福利问题的各种不同意见，准备印发给大家进行专题辩论。
