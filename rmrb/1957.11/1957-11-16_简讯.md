    Hani Hunters Hunt Fish-Sparrows
    Hani hunters in the Honghe area of Yunnan have again begun hunting grey fish-sparrows in the evergreen broad-leaved forests of the mountains, using shotguns, crossbows, or bamboo baskets. The sound of gunfire and cheers of catching fish-sparrows constantly echo through the vine-covered forests.
    The fish-sparrow is a migratory bird that comes to inhabit and forage in the Ailao Mountain forests of the Honghe River basin every year in September. The meat of the fish-sparrow is delicious, and the bones are crispy; some are as plump and tender as young hens. People in the Honghe River basin and the interior of the country consider fish-sparrows a delicacy on the banquet table. Hunting fish-sparrows is a lucrative source of income for Hani hunters. During this season, the average hunting household can earn tens of yuan.

    New Plant Species Discovered in Northern Guangxi
    The Guangxi branch of the South China Botanical Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences discovered a new species of coniferous tree in the virgin forests at the junction of Longsheng, Sanjiang, Rongan, Yongfu, and Lingui counties in northern Guangxi Province. After identification by plant taxonomy experts Professors Chen Huanyong and Kuang Keren, it was determined to be a new genus and new species, named "Genshan" (艮杉). Genshan belongs to the gymnosperm family Pinaceae in plant taxonomy. Research data on the position of Genshan in the plant system, wood anatomy, and mechanical properties are being compiled and prepared for publication.
    In this forest area, nine new species of rhododendrons, including Short-veined Rhododendron, Jixin Rhododendron, and Guangfu Rhododendron, were also discovered. The naming of these nine new species was determined after identification by Professors Chen Huanyong and Fang Wenpei and was published in the second issue of the sixth volume of the Acta Phytotaxonomica Sinica this year.
