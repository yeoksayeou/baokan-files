Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, November 17th: "Al Masaa" reported on the 16th that King Hussein of Jordan has ordered the withdrawal of Jordanian troops stationed on the Jordanian-Israeli border, so that the U.S. Sixth Fleet's Marines can pass through Israel into Jordan to protect Hussein and suppress the popular protests sweeping the country.

The newspaper said that this action would also allow Israeli troops to enter Jordan after the Americans occupy the West Bank.

Israel has already begun to strengthen its military strongholds along the border, preparing to attack Palestinian refugees settled in the area, because the refugees most strongly oppose Hussein's pro-American policies and the U.S. and Jordanian conspiracy on the Palestinian issue.

"Al-Shaab" said: "Jordan has established a reign of terror. Soldiers patrol the streets of various cities, firing shots into the air from time to time to intimidate peaceful residents. Tanks and motorcycles guard the royal palace."

The newspaper said that people coming from Jordan said that the situation in the country, especially in the West Bank area where Palestinian refugees live, is very serious. Bedouin troops loyal to the royal family have been dispatched to Jordanian Jerusalem, Ramallah, and Nablus. American-made armored vehicles drive through the streets from time to time.

    约旦国王要引进美军做靠山
    以色列准备袭击巴勒斯坦难民
    新华社开罗17日电　“晚报”16日报道，约旦国王侯赛因已经下令撤退驻在约旦—以色列边境上的约旦军队，以便美国第六舰队的海军陆战队能够经过以色列进入约旦来保护侯赛因和镇压席卷全国的人民的抗议示威运动。
    这家报纸说，这个行动也将使以色列军队在美国人占据约旦河西岸以后能够进入约旦。
    以色列已经在开始加强边境一带的军事据点，准备袭击在这个地区定居的巴勒斯坦难民，因为难民最强烈地反对侯赛因的亲美政策，反对美国和约旦在巴勒斯坦问题上的阴谋。
    “人民报”说：“约旦已经建立了恐怖统治。士兵们在各城市街道巡逻，不时放空枪来恫吓和平居民。有坦克和摩托车守卫着王宫。”
    这家报纸说，从约旦来的人说，国内的情况，特别是在巴勒斯坦难民居住的约旦河西岸地区的情况非常严重。忠于王室的贝都印人部队开到了耶路撒冷约旦区、拉马拉、纳布鲁斯这些城市。街道上不时有美制的装甲车驶过。
