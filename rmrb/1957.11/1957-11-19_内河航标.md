Inland River Navigation Marks

The task of inland river navigation marks is to accurately indicate the direction of inland waterways, mark waterway boundaries and obstacles in the waterway that endanger safe navigation, announce the minimum depth of shallow water channels, direct the navigation order of ships in narrow and sharply curved sections, bridges, ship locks, and other temporarily blocked areas, and provide advance warning of impending typhoons or storms.

The setting of new navigation marks is divided into three classes: First-class marks are set on rivers with particularly developed shipping. The navigation marks are interwoven to form a series of uninterrupted chains, enabling ships to see from one mark to the next. These navigation marks are all illuminated at night. Second-class marks are set on rivers with relatively developed shipping. These navigation marks are also interwoven to form a series of uninterrupted chains. At night, all shore marks are illuminated, but buoys are only illuminated on difficult major waterways. Third-class marks are set on rivers with less developed shipping. Ships can only use the marks and natural features to navigate safely during the day.

New inland river navigation marks are further divided into three types according to their function: marks that guide navigation, marks that indicate danger, and signal marks.

After setting up marks on rivers, it is also necessary to continuously change and move the marks according to different water depths, flow rates, and flow directions.

    内河航标
    内河航标的任务，是准确地标示内河航道方向，标示航道界限及航道中妨碍航行安全的障碍物，通告浅水航道的最小深度，指挥狭窄、急弯、桥梁、船闸及其他临时封锁地段船舶的航行秩序，以及预告即将到来的台风或暴风。
    新航标的设置分为三等：一等标志设置在航运特别发达的河流上。航标互相交组成一系列不间断的锁链，使船舶能从一个航标看到下一个航标。这种航标夜间全部发光。二等标志设置在航运较为发达的河流上。这种航标也交组成一系列不间断的锁链，夜间岸标全部发光，但浮标只在困难的主要航道上发光。三等标志设置在航运不甚发达的河流上。船舶只能利用标志和天然物在白天安全航行。
    新内河航标在作用上又分为引导航行的标志、指示危险的标志和信号标志三种。
    在河流上设置标志以后，还需要不断地根据不同水深、流速、流向等情况变更和移动标志。
