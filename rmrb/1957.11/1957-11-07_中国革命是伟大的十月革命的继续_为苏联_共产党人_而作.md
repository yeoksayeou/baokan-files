    The great October Socialist Revolution in Russia achieved its victory forty years ago. The October Socialist Revolution opened a new era in world history, unveiling the first page of a new epoch of the demise of capitalism and the victory of socialism. It has had a profound impact on the development of human society. Comrade Mao Zedong once said: "Since the victory of the great Soviet October Socialist Revolution, the situation of the people's victory in the world has been determined, and now this situation has been developed and consolidated due to the founding of the People's Republic of China and the establishment of various people's democratic countries." (Opening speech of the Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, see Xinhua Monthly, General No. 25, page 5)
    The October Revolution was a true great people's revolution. The road of the October Revolution is a true Marxist-Leninist road. The people of every country and nation in the world will, under the leadership of the working class, follow this common path towards socialism and communism according to their own national characteristics. Our people, under the leadership of the working class, have embarked on this road illuminated by the light of the October Revolution, and thus won the victory of the revolution and the development of socialism. Precisely because of this, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China stated in the political report of the Eighth National Congress of the Party, "Although our country's revolution has its own many characteristics, the Chinese Communists regard the cause they are undertaking as a continuation of the great October Revolution."
    The victory of the Chinese revolution and construction is a victory of Marxism-Leninism in all aspects. Since its establishment, the Communist Party of China has regarded the integration of the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution as its consistent ideological principle. It is in this sense that we can proudly say that the Communist Party of China is forever one of the inheritors of the great tradition of the October Revolution. The Chinese Communists have consistently followed the tradition of the October Revolution, striving to build a Leninist revolutionary party of the working class in China, struggling to uphold the Marxist-Leninist leadership in the revolutionary and construction cause in China, and striving to uphold the principle of proletarian internationalism in the international communist movement. The great tradition of the October Revolution, like a red thread, runs through the entire process of the development of the Chinese revolution and construction cause, becoming the basic guarantee for the victory of the Chinese revolution and construction cause.
    Building a working-class party based on Marxist-Leninist theory and the example of the Soviet Communist Party is precisely the most concentrated, most distinct, and most prominent manifestation of the great tradition of the October Revolution in China. Lenin said that in order to defeat capitalism, the proletariat must have a party that acts as its vanguard, a party that contains all the best representatives of its class, composed of conscious and loyal communists who have been educated and nurtured by tenacious revolutionary struggles, who can connect themselves with the entire life of their class and through this class connect themselves with the entire mass of the exploited, and who can win the full trust of their class and all the working masses. Comrade Mao Zedong also often said that in our country, without a Leninist revolutionary party established according to Marxist-Leninist theory and style, it would be impossible to lead the working class and the broad masses of the people to victory over imperialism and its running dogs. He said, "In the more than one hundred years since the emergence of Marxism, only when the Russian Bolsheviks led the October Revolution, led socialist construction, and defeated fascist aggression, did a new type of revolutionary party be established and developed on a world scale. Since the emergence of such a revolutionary party, the face of the world revolution has changed. ... The Communist Party of China is a party established and developed according to the example of the Soviet Communist Party. Since the emergence of the Communist Party of China, the face of the Chinese revolution has been completely renewed."
  (Mao Zedong's thesis written for the special issue commemorating the thirty-first anniversary of the October Revolution for the magazine "Lasting Peace and People's Democracy" on November 4, 1948, entitled: "Unite All Revolutionary Forces of the World to Combat Imperialist Aggression," see "Internationalism and Nationalism," page 3)
    Adhering to the unity of Marxism-Leninism within its own ranks, adhering to the principle of close integration of the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of the revolution in one's own country, this is the mark of this new type of revolutionary party. According to Lenin's famous saying: "Without revolutionary theory, there can be no revolutionary movement," "Only a party guided by advanced theory can fulfill the role of advanced fighters." Comrade Mao Zedong often said that if our party is to be able to fulfill a series of great historical tasks, to be able to lead the Chinese people from one victory to another, the first thing to do is to form the unity of Marxism-Leninism within the party, to raise the Marxist-Leninist level of the whole party, and to consolidate the ideological and political leadership of Marxism-Leninism. He pointed out that Marxism-Leninism is a universally applicable theory, and the whole party should learn Marxism-Leninism as a revolutionary science and guide to action. He said: "The great power of Marxism-Leninism lies in the fact that it is linked with the concrete revolutionary practice of various countries. For the Communist Party of China, it is necessary to learn to apply the theory of Marxism-Leninism to the specific environment of China." (Selected Works of Mao Zedong, Volume 2, page 497, "The Position of the Communist Party of China in the National War")
    The Chinese Communists, represented by Comrade Mao Zedong, precisely on the basis of the fundamental views of Marxism-Leninism on the new era of imperialism and proletarian revolution, on the basis of the fundamental changes in world history after the October Revolution, and combined with the fundamental changes in Chinese history after the Chinese working class ascended the political stage, examined the Chinese revolution, recognized that the Chinese revolution after the May Fourth Movement in 1919 had changed its face, no longer the old democratic revolution led by the bourgeoisie, but the new democratic revolution led by the proletariat. The Chinese revolution must be thoroughly anti-imperialist and anti-feudal, and it must carry out a thorough break with imperialism and feudalism. The Chinese revolution must be guided to the establishment of a people's republic led by the proletariat, and through the people's republic led by the proletariat to socialism and communism, while a bourgeois republic is a reactionary fantasy that cannot be realized in China.
    The Chinese Communists, represented by Comrade Mao Zedong, also precisely on the basis of the fundamental views of Marxism-Leninism on the interrelationship between proletarian revolution and national revolution in colonies and semi-colonies, on the basis of the interrelationship between bourgeois democratic revolution and socialist revolution as manifested by the October Revolution, and combined with the semi-colonial and semi-feudal nature of Chinese society, examined the Chinese revolution, recognized that the Chinese revolution must be divided into two steps, bourgeois democratic revolution and socialist revolution, and adopted the fundamental policy of distinguishing these two revolutions of different natures from each other while closely connecting the latter revolution with the former revolution. In the democratic revolution, all necessary conditions were created as much as possible for the socialist revolution, and once the democratic revolution had won a nationwide victory, the struggle for the socialist revolution was launched without hesitation.
    The Chinese Communists, represented by Comrade Mao Zedong, also precisely on the basis of the fundamental views of Marxism-Leninism on the leadership of the proletariat and the worker-peasant alliance, on the basis of the basic experience, confirmed by the October Revolution, on the proletariat, under the leadership of the Communist Party, uniting all working people to seize power, and combined with the actual situation of the interrelationship and balance of power of the various classes in Chinese society, examined the Chinese revolution, recognized that the Chinese revolution must be led by the proletariat, must rely on the solid alliance of the two classes of workers and peasants, and at the same time, under Chinese conditions, it is also necessary to establish a revolutionary united front with the national bourgeoisie. The most fundamental thing here is the leadership of the proletariat, and the leadership of the proletariat is the leadership of the Communist Party, which is the leadership of Marxism-Leninism. The victory of the Chinese revolution fully confirmed the correctness of the road of the October Revolution. Although the Chinese revolution has its own specific characteristics in seizing power, the basic experience of the October Revolution gave us great inspiration. The October Revolution proved that the basic issue of the revolution is the issue of political power, and only when the proletariat seizes power and establishes the dictatorship of the proletariat can it open the road to socialism and communism.
    As the first country of the dictatorship of the proletariat, the Soviet Union is a great example in building socialism. It possesses the richest experience, and the main and fundamental aspects of this experience have universal significance at the present stage of human history. Lenin himself drafted the scientific program for carrying out socialist transformation and socialist construction in the Soviet Union, and this scientific program is precisely the complete doctrine of Marxism-Leninism on the transition period. Due to differences in historical conditions, social structure, and characteristics of revolutionary development, the specific forms of the road to socialism in various countries are bound to be diverse and cannot be completely identical to each other. However, the Marxist-Leninist doctrine on the transition period is applicable to any country, because the fundamental principles stipulated by this doctrine regarding consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat, implementing the nationalization of industry and the collectivization of agriculture, developing the socialist economy and socialist culture in a planned way, gradually raising the people's living standards on this basis, and actively preparing conditions for the transition to communism are precisely the universally applicable truths of Marxism-Leninism.
    Based on the above-mentioned Lenin's doctrine on the transition period, on the basis of the basic experience of the Soviet Union in building socialism, and combined with the actual situation of the development of politics, economy, culture, and society in our country after the nationwide liberation, the Chinese Communists formulated the general line and general policy for carrying out socialist transformation and socialist construction in our country. In 1956, the socialist transformation of the ownership of the means of production had been basically completed, and a great victory had been won in the socialist revolution on the economic front, while in 1957, a great victory will be won in completing the first five-year plan for developing the national economy. The victory of the socialist revolution in terms of the means of production on the economic front gives us better conditions to carry out the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts; and the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts will in turn promote and strengthen the socialist revolution on the economic front, accelerate the establishment of a modern industrial base and a modern agricultural base, and achieve the victory of building a completely consolidated socialist society within the expected period. This is the road to building socialism that our people are experiencing.
    In the aspect of socialist construction, our Party has learned from the basic experience of the Soviet Union and adopted the line of socialist industrialization centered on the development of heavy industry and aimed at establishing a modern industrial base and a modern agricultural base. Because the socialist revolution has brought about a great liberation of the productive forces, and with the assistance of the Soviet Union and other socialist brother countries, we have the possibility of completing this arduous task in the period of three five-year plans. In order to complete this task, we have adopted the policy of giving priority to the development of heavy industry, so as to promote the priority growth of the production of the means of production at a much faster rate than capitalist production. At the same time, we have adopted a policy of developing agriculture and light industry in line with the priority development of heavy industry, so as to continuously improve the people's purchasing power, expand the domestic market, and accelerate capital accumulation to meet the growing needs of developing the national economy and improving the people's livelihood. Our country has a large population, a weak foundation, and is still very backward in all aspects, so we attach great importance to the experience of the Soviet Union in the early days of its founding, and regard diligence and thrift in building the country as our long-term policy for building socialism, striving to achieve diligence and thrift in running enterprises, diligence and thrift in running cooperatives, and diligence and thrift in running all undertakings. At the same time, we also attach great importance to learning from the experience of the Soviet Union in the cultural revolution, and according to the characteristics of our country, strive to basically eliminate illiteracy, popularize primary education, improve the cultural level of workers and peasants, establish a contingent of working-class intellectuals, and enable the main scientific departments to catch up with the advanced level of the world in the shortest possible time, and at the same time adopt the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" to promote the prosperity of science and culture in our country.
    Our people's democratic dictatorship is a state system based on the worker-peasant alliance led by the working class. Without such a state system, we would not be able to completely solve the tasks of the bourgeois democratic revolution, let alone solve the tasks of the socialist revolution. Our current people's democratic dictatorship is a form of the dictatorship of the proletariat, and the basic point of this form of the dictatorship of the proletariat is, needless to say, learning from the example of the Soviet Union. Of course, it also has its own characteristics. In addition to having a worker-peasant alliance led by the working class as its foundation, this revolutionary regime also has a people's democratic united front led by the working class, including all democratic classes, all democratic parties, all people's organizations, and all other patriotic people, continuing to play a role in national life. Under this state system, the dictatorship over the enemy and the democracy within the people are united. The dictatorship is used to solve the contradictions between ourselves and the enemy, while the democracy is used to deal with the contradictions within the people. Our democracy is socialist democracy, which does not belong to a few people but to the vast majority of the population, including workers, peasants, and all other working people, as well as all people who support socialism and are patriotic. The purpose of this socialist democracy is not to weaken the dictatorship of the proletariat, but to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, that is, to consolidate the leadership of the working class and the Communist Party, develop the enthusiasm of the people in building socialism, and develop their enthusiasm in fighting against all enemies who oppose and undermine the socialist cause. The organizational principle of this socialist democracy is democratic centralism, which is a combination of high degree of democracy and high degree of centralization. The unity of democracy and centralism, the unity of freedom and discipline, and the unity of administrative means and persuasive education means, these are the characteristics of this socialist democracy. Only this democratic centralism can fully develop the enthusiasm and creativity of the people, and only on this basis can the people form political unity, and only then can our state organs truly become powerful weapons to defend the interests of the people, defend the socialist cause, and defend the independence and security of our country.
    In the forty years since the October Revolution, the international communist movement has achieved extremely great achievements, becoming a powerful political force on a worldwide scale. The proletariat of the world and all working people who yearn for liberation place all their hopes on the victory of this movement, and this movement is precisely guided by Marxism-Leninism. Marxism-Leninism, as Comrade Mao Zedong said, "is surging throughout the world with overwhelming momentum, thunderous force, and immense power, and maintaining its wonderful youth" (Selected Works of Mao Zedong, Volume 2, page 657, "On New Democracy"). Of course, Marxism-Leninism is a guide to action, it is not stagnant and unchanging, it itself is developing, and the experience of the revolutionary movement of each country and the experience of transitioning to socialism will contribute to Marxism-Leninism and enrich and replenish its treasure house. It is wrong to regard Marxism-Leninism as unchanging, to regard individual words and sentences in Marxist-Leninist books as dogma without considering whether these words and sentences are suitable for the objective reality of the revolution in one's own country and the objective needs of the people in one's own country. This is a dogmatic attitude towards Marxism-Leninism. However, if in opposing dogmatism we go to an extreme, completely abandon the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism, completely deny the universal significance of the basic experience of the October Revolution and Soviet construction, and unilaterally emphasize the national characteristics of one's own country to an inappropriate extent, this is also wrong. This is a revisionist attitude towards Marxism-Leninism. Revisionism is a tendency that deviates from the fundamental principles of Marxism-Leninism and secretly transports bourgeois viewpoints into the ranks of the working class. Lenin had long pointed out the extreme danger of revisionist tendencies to the working-class revolutionary movement. While overcoming dogmatic tendencies, we must insist on carrying out the struggle against revisionism, and at present, opposing revisionism is a particularly urgent task. Marxism-Leninism has developed precisely from the struggle against dogmatism and revisionism on these two fronts. The Communist Party of China has also carried out the struggle on these two fronts, adhered to the principle of the unity of Marxist-Leninist theory and practice, and guided the victory of the Chinese revolution and construction cause. The Communist Party of China consistently educates its members to continue to maintain this great tradition of the October Revolution, to defend the purity of Marxism-Leninism, and to uphold the unity of Marxism-Leninism in the communist movement, all of which is where the party spirit of us Chinese Communists lies.
    Lenin taught us that in order to oppose the international united front of the bourgeoisie, the proletariat of all countries must also implement its own international united front, and the revolutionary action of the proletariat in each country must develop and promote the general movement of the international proletarian revolution to the greatest extent. Comrade Mao Zedong said, "In this world, all imperialists are our enemies, and China cannot achieve independence without the assistance of socialist countries and the international proletariat." (Selected Works of Mao Zedong, Volume 2, page 651) When leading the struggle of the working class and all other working people in our country to carry out revolution and construction, we must unite with the international revolutionary forces, first of all, unite with the socialist camp centered on the Soviet Union. The Central Committee of our Party also emphasized in the political report to the Eighth National Congress of the Party that consolidating and strengthening the unity between our country and the great Soviet Union and other socialist countries is our highest international obligation. Combining patriotism and internationalism in our own ranks, and treating internationalism as our code of conduct in the international communist movement, this is also the great tradition of the October Revolution.
    In the international arena, the only correct position we must take can only be proletarian internationalism. The starting point of this proletarian internationalism is that the communist movement has been an international movement from the very beginning, and the cause of establishing the dictatorship of the proletariat and building socialism, which was founded by the October Revolution, has always been the common cause of the international proletariat, and the various differences and boundaries between any country and nation cannot alleviate our responsibility for this common cause. The Soviet Union has become the center of the international proletariat and the communist movement, and this is precisely the greatest historical achievement of the October Revolution. It is the first socialist country, the first to reach the stage of transition to communism, the most experienced, and the most powerful. Only it can give the cause of liberation of the proletariat of all countries the most significant assistance, and only by relying on it can the people of the world defend the cause of peace and prevent the occurrence of a third world war. What imperialism fears most is our socialist countries, is this unity of socialist countries and the international proletariat. In order to achieve the goal of destroying the communist cause, they always try every possible means to undermine our unity, and in the face of a strong enemy, firmly maintaining this unity is the most urgent task of the revolutionary faction of the proletariat of all countries. For us proletarian revolutionaries, patriotism and internationalism are consistent. Internationalism refers to the unity and cooperation of the proletariat of all countries in the revolutionary struggle, patriotism refers to the most full reflection and representation of the interests of the people of their own nation by the proletariat of all countries in the revolutionary struggle, and uniting the international revolutionary forces to fight against the common enemy—imperialism—is precisely the greatest and most fundamental interest of the people of all countries. Continuing to maintain this great tradition of the October Revolution, strengthening the proletarian internationalist unity centered on the Soviet Union, this is also what we Chinese Communists consider ourselves to be fulfilling our international obligations.
    In the cheers of the people of the world celebrating the anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution, people will remember Lenin's famous saying: "The farther this great day is away from us, the more obvious the significance of the Russian proletarian revolution will be." Today, everything is very clear: the death knell of the old world has been ringing louder and louder, and the prospect of a new world of socialism and communism has been presented before the eyes of mankind.

    中国革命是伟大的十月革命的继续
    ·为苏联“共产党人”而作·
　　康生
    伟大的十月社会主义革命在俄国的胜利，至今已经四十年了。十月社会主义革命开辟了世界历史的新纪元，揭开了资本主义灭亡，社会主义胜利的新时代的第一页。它给了人类社会的发展以极其深远的影响。毛泽东同志说过：“自从伟大的苏联十月社会主义革命胜利以后，世界上人民胜利的局面就确定了，现在则因为中华人民共和国的成立和各人民民主国家的成立而使这个局面发展和巩固了。”（中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第三次会议开会词见新华月报总第25号第五页）
    十月革命是一个真正的人民大革命。十月革命的道路是一条真正的马克思列宁主义的道路。世界上每个国家和民族的人民都必将在工人阶级领导下，按照自己的民族特点，沿着这条共同的道路走向社会主义和共产主义。我国人民就正是在工人阶级领导下，踏上了这条由十月革命的光芒照亮了的道路，因而赢得了革命胜利和社会主义的发展。正是因为这样，中国共产党中央委员会在党的第八次全国代表大会的政治报告中说，“尽管我国的革命有自己的许多特点，可是中国共产党人把自己所干的事业看成是伟大的十月革命的继续。”
    中国革命和建设的胜利，在一切方面都是马克思列宁主义的胜利。中国共产党自从成立之日起，就把马克思列宁主义的普遍真理和中国革命的具体实践相结合当做是自己一贯的思想原则。正是在这个意义上，我们可以自豪地说，中国共产党永远是十月革命的伟大传统的继承者之一。中国共产党人一贯遵循着十月革命的传统，为在中国建设一个列宁式的工人阶级革命政党而努力，为在中国坚持革命和建设事业中的马克思列宁主义的领导而斗争，为在中国坚持国际共产主义运动中的无产阶级国际主义原则而奋斗。十月革命的伟大传统，像一根红线一样贯穿着中国革命和建设事业的发展的整个过程，成为中国革命和建设事业的胜利的基本保证。
    根据马克思列宁主义的理论和苏联共产党的榜样而建设一个工人阶级的政党，这正是十月革命的伟大传统在中国的最集中最鲜明最突出的表现。列宁说过，为要战胜资本主义，无产阶级就要有一个充当自己的先锋队的党，这个党要包含本阶级一切最优秀的代表，要由那些为顽强的革命斗争所教育和培养出来的、有觉悟的和忠诚的共产主义者所组成，要能够把自己同本阶级的全部生活联系起来而又能通过本阶级同被剥削的整个群众联系起来，要能够获得本阶级和一切劳动群众的充分信任。毛泽东同志也常说，在我国，没有一个按照马克思列宁主义理论和风格建立起来的列宁式的革命政党，就不可能领导工人阶级和广大人民群众取得战胜帝国主义及其走狗的胜利。他说，“自从马克思主义产生以来的一百多年时间内，只有在俄国布尔什维克领导十月革命、领导社会主义建设和战胜法西斯侵略的时候，才在世界范围内建立了和发展了新式的革命党。自从有了这样的革命党，世界革命的面目就起了变化了。……中国共产党就是依照苏联共产党的榜样建立起来和发展起来的一个党。自从有了中国共产党，中国革命的面目就焕然一新了。”
  （1948年11月4日毛主席给“持久和平与人民民主”杂志纪念十月革命三十一周年专号所写的论文，题目：“全世界革命力量团结起来，反对帝国主义的侵略”见“国际主义与民族主义”一书第3页）
    在自己的队伍中坚持马克思列宁主义的统一，坚持马克思列宁主义的普遍真理和本国革命的具体实践密切结合的原则，这是这种新式革命党的标志。根据列宁的名言：“没有革命的理论，就不会有革命的运动”，“只有受先进理论指导的党，才能实现先进战士的作用”。毛泽东同志常说，我们党要能够实现一系列伟大的历史任务，要能够把中国人民从一个胜利引导到又一个胜利，首先就要在党内形成马克思列宁主义的统一，提高全党的马克思列宁主义的水平，巩固马克思列宁主义的思想和政治的领导。他指出，马克思列宁主义是放之四海而皆准的理论，全党都应当把马克思列宁主义当做革命的科学和行动的指南来学习。他说：“马克思列宁主义的伟大力量，就在于它是和各个国家具体的革命实践相联系的。对于中国共产党说来，就是要学会把马克思列宁主义的理论应用于中国的具体的环境。”（毛泽东选集第二卷第497页“中国共产党在民族战争中的地位”）
    中国共产党人，以毛泽东同志为代表，正是根据马克思列宁主义关于帝国主义和无产阶级革命新时代的根本观点，根据十月革命以后世界历史的根本变化，结合中国工人阶级登上政治舞台以后中国历史的根本变化来考察中国革命，认定了中国革命以1919年的五四运动以后就改变了自
  己的面目，不再是资产阶级领导的旧民主主义革命，而是无产阶级领导的新民主主义革命。中国革命必须是彻底反帝反封建的，必须同帝国主义和封建主义实行彻底的决裂。中国革命必须引导到建立无产阶级领导的人民共和国，通过无产阶级领导的人民共和国到达社会主义和共产主义，而资产阶级共和国在中国是不能实现的反动的幻想。
      中国共产党人，以毛泽东同志为代表，也正是根据马克思列宁主义关于无产阶级革命和殖民地半殖民地民族革命相互关系的根本观点，根据十月革命所表现的资产阶级民主革命和社会主义革命的相互关系，结合中国社会的半殖民地半封建的性质来考察中国革命，认定了中国革命必须分为资产阶级民主革命和社会主义革命两个步骤来进行，采取了把这两个性质不同的革命互相区别而又使后一革命紧密地衔接着前一革命的根本政策。在民主革命中尽量为社会主义革命创造了一切必要条件，而在民主革命一经取得全国胜利以后就毫不停顿地展开了社会主义革命的斗争。
    中国共产党人，以毛泽东同志为代表，也正是根据马克思列宁主义关于无产阶级领导权和工农联盟的根本观点，根据十月革命所证实了的关于无产阶级在共产党领导下联合一切劳动人民夺取政权的基本经验，结合中国社会各阶级的相互关系和力量对比的实际情况来考察中国革命，认定了中国革命必须由无产阶级领导，必须依靠工人和农民这两个阶级的巩固联盟，同时在中国条件下还必须同民族资产阶级建立革命的统一战线。在这里最根本的东西，就是无产阶级的领导，而无产阶级的领导就是共产党的领导，就是马克思列宁主义的领导。中国革命的胜利充分地证实了十月革命道路的正确性。尽管中国革命在夺取政权方面有自己的具体的特点，但十月革命的基本经验给了我们极大的启发。十月革命证明革命的基本问题是政权问题，无产阶级只有夺取了政权，建立了无产阶级专政，才能够打开通往社会主义和共产主义的道路。
    作为第一个无产阶级专政的国家，苏联在建设社会主义方面是一个伟大的榜样。它拥有最丰富的经验，这些经验的主要的和基本的方面在人类历史的现阶段具有普遍的意义。列宁自己手订了在苏联进行社会主义改造和社会主义建设的科学纲领，这个科学纲领也正是马克思列宁主义关于过渡时期的完整的学说。由于历史条件、社会结构和革命发展特点等等方面的不同，各国向社会主义过渡的道路的具体形式必然是多种多样的，不可能彼此完全相同。但是，马克思列宁主义关于过渡时期的学说对于任何国家都是适用的，因为这个学说所规定的关于巩固无产阶级专政、实行工业国有化和农业集体化、有计划地发展社会主义经济和社会主义文化、在这个基础上逐步提高人民的生活水平、积极准备条件向共产主义过渡等等根本原理也正是马克思列宁主义的放之四海而皆准的普遍真理。
      中国共产党人根据上述列宁关于过渡时期的学说，根据苏联建设社会主义的基本经验，而又结合我国全国解放以后政治、经济、文化、社会各方面发展的实际情况，制订了在我国进行社会主义改造和社会主义建设的总路线和总政策。在1956年中已经在基本上完成了生产资料所有制方面的社会主义改造，取得了经济战线上社会主义革命的伟大胜利，而在1957年又将赢得完成发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的伟大胜利。经济战线上生产资料方面的社会主义革命的胜利，使我们有更好的条件来进行政治战线和思想战线上的社会主义革命；而政治战线上和思想战线上的社会主义革命又将反过来促进和加强经济战线上的社会主义革命，加速现代化工业基础和现代化农业基础的建立，在预期的时期内取得建成完全巩固的社会主义社会的胜利。这就是我国人民正在经历的建设社会主义的道路。
    在社会主义建设方面我们党学习了苏联基本经验，采取了以发展重工业为中心的、以建立现代化工业基础和现代化农业基础为目标的社会主义工业化的路线。由于社会主义革命带来了对于生产力的大解放，在有苏联和其他社会主义兄弟国家的援助的条件下，我们有可能在三个五年计划时期完成这个艰巨的任务。为着完成这个任务，我们采取了优先发展重工业的方针，以比资本主义生产更快得多的速度来促进生产资料生产的优先增长。而与此同时，我们又采取了同优先发展重工业相适应的发展农业和轻工业的方针，以不断提高人民的购买力、扩大国内市场、加速资金积累来满足发展国民经济和改善人民生活的日益增长的需要。我们国家人口多，底子薄，各方面都还很落后，因此我们非常重视苏联建国初期的经验，把勤俭建国当做我们建设社会主义的长远方针，力求做到勤俭办企业、勤俭办合作社和勤俭办一切事业。同时我们也非常重视学习苏联的文化革命的经验，并根据我国的特点，力求在最短的时期内基本上消灭文盲，普及小学教育，提高工农群众的文化程度，建立工人阶级知识分子队伍，使主要的科学部门赶上世界的先进水平，同时采取“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针来促进我国科学和文化的繁荣。
    我国人民民主专政是工人阶级领导的以工农联盟为基础的国家制度，没有这样的国家制度，我们就不可能彻底地解决资产阶级民主革命的任务，当然更不可能解决社会主义革命的任务。我国现时的人民民主专政是无产阶级专政的一种形式，这种形式的无产阶级专政的基本点，不消说是学习的苏联的榜样。当然，也具有自己的特点。除了有一个工人阶级领导的工农联盟做自己的基础之外，这个革命政权还有一个工人阶级领导的包括各民主阶级、各民主党派、各人民团体和其他一切爱国人士在内的人民民主统一战线在国家生活中继续发挥作用。在这个国家制度下，对于敌人的专政和对于人民内部的民主是统一在一起的，专政是用来解决敌我矛盾的，而民主是用来处理人民内部的矛盾问题的。我们的民主是社会主义的民主，它不是属于少数人而是属于全人口中占绝大多数的工人、农民和其他一切劳动人民以及一切拥护社会主义的和爱国的人民。这种社会主义民主的目的不是用来削弱无产阶级专政，而是必须巩固无产阶级专政，即巩固工人阶级和共产党的领导，发展人民群众建设社会主义的积极性，发展他们同一切反对和破坏社会主义事业的敌人作斗争的积极性。这种社会主义民主的组织原则是民主集中制，它是高度的民主和高度的集中的结合。民主和集中的统一，自由和纪律的统一，行政手段和说服教育手段的统一，这就是这种社会主义民主的特点。只有这种民主集中制，才能够充分发展人民群众的积极性和创造性，才能够在这种基础上形成人民群众政治上的一致性，也才能够使我们的国家机构真正成为保卫人民利益、保卫社会主义事业、保卫我们国家独立和安全的强有力的武器。
    十月革命以来的四十年间，国际共产主义运动获得了极其伟大的成就，在全世界范围内成为强大的政治力量，全世界无产阶级和一切渴望解放的劳动人民把他们的全部希望寄托在这个运动的胜利上面，而这个运动正是以马克思列宁主义为指导思想的。马克思列宁主义，正像毛泽东同志所说的，“正以排山倒海之势，雷霆万钧之力，磅薄于全世界，而葆其美妙之青春”（毛泽东选集第二卷第657页“新民主主义论”）。当然，马克思列宁主义是行动的指南，它不是停滞不前、一成不变的，它本身是发展的，每个国家的革命运动的经验和过渡到社会主义的经验都会对马克思列宁主义作出贡献而使它的宝库丰富和充实起来。把马克思列宁主义看成是不变的，把马克思列宁主义书本上的个别词句当做教条而毫不考虑这些词句是否适合本国革命的客观实际和本国人民的客观需要，这是错误的。这就是对于马克思列宁主义的教条主义态度。但是，如果在反对教条主义的时候走到一个极端，根本背弃马克思列宁主义的普遍真理，根本否认十月革命和苏联建设的基本经验的普遍意义，把本国的民族特点片面地强调到不适当的程度，这也是错误的。这就是对于马克思列宁主义的修正主义态度。修正主义是背离了马克思列宁主义的根本原则，而把资产阶级观点偷偷地运输到工人阶级队伍中间来的一种倾向。列宁早已指出了修正主义倾向对于工人革命运动的极端危险性。我们克服教条主义倾向的同时，必须坚持进行反对修正主义的斗争，而在目前，反对修正主义尤其是迫切的任务。马克思列宁主义正是从反对教条主义和修正主义这两条战线的斗争中发展起来的。中国共产党也正是进行了这样两条战线的斗争，坚持了马克思列宁主义的理论和实际的统一的原则，而指导了中国革命和建设事业的胜利的。中国共产党一贯地教育自己的党员，继续保持十月革命这个伟大传统，保卫马克思列宁主义的纯洁性，在共产主义运动中坚持马克思列宁主义的统一，这一切就是我们中国共产党人的党性的所在。
    列宁教导我们说，为了反对资产阶级的国际联合，各国的无产阶级也要实行自己的国际联合，每个国家无产阶级在本国的革命行动都要最大限度地发展和推动国际无产阶级革命的总运动。毛泽东同志说，“这个世界上，所有帝国主义都是我们的敌人，中国要独立，决不能离开社会主义国家和国际无产阶级的援助。”（毛泽东选集第二卷第651页）在领导本国工人阶级和其他一切劳动人民进行革命和建设的斗争的时候，我们必须同国际革命力量团结一致，首先是同以苏联为中心的社会主义阵营团结一致。我们党的中央委员会向党的第八次全国代表大会的政治报告中也强调指出，巩固和加强我国同伟大的苏联和其他社会主义国家的团结是我们最高的国际义务。在自己的队伍中把爱国主义和国际主义结合起来，把国际主义当做自己在国际共产主义运动中的行为的准则，这也正是十月革命的伟大传统。
    在国际上，我们必须采取的唯一正确的立场只能是无产阶级的国际主义。这种无产阶级国际主义的出发点是，共产主义运动一开始就是国际性的运动，十月革命所创始的建立无产阶级专政和建设社会主义的事业，从来就是国际无产阶级的共同事业，任何国家和民族之间的各种差别和界限都不能减轻我们对于这个共同事业的责任。苏联成为国际无产阶级和共产主义运动的中心，这正是十月革命最伟大的历史成果。它是第一个社会主义国家，最先走到向共产主义过渡的发展阶段，经验最丰富，国力最强大，只有它能够给予各国无产阶级的解放事业以最重大的援助，也只有依靠它，世界人民才能够保卫住和平事业而阻止第三次世界大战的发生。帝国主义最害怕的就是我们社会主义国家，就是社会主义国家和国际无产阶级的这种团结，他们为了达到毁灭共产主义事业的目的，总是千方百计要来破坏我们这种团结，而大敌当前，坚定地维护这种团结正是各国无产阶级革命派最迫切的任务。对于我们无产阶级革命派说来，爱国主义和国际主义是一致的。国际主义所指的是各国无产阶级在革命斗争中的团结和合作，爱国主义所指的是各国无产阶级在革命斗争中最充分地反映和代表本民族人民的利益，而联合国际革命力量来对共同的敌人——帝国主义进行斗争正是各国人民最大的最根本的利益。继续保持十月革命的这个伟大传统，加强以苏联为中心的无产阶级的国际主义团结，这也正是我们中国共产党人所认为自己应尽的国际义务。
    在全世界人民庆祝伟大的十月社会主义革命纪念节的欢呼声中，人们都会记起列宁的名言：“这个伟大的日子离开我们愈远，俄国无产阶级革命的意义就愈明显。”今天一切都非常清楚：旧世界的丧钟已经越敲越响了，社会主义、共产主义的新世界的前景已经呈现在人类的眼前。
