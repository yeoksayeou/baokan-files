    Overcoming Right-leaning Thought: Reversal of Counter-Revolutionary Case
    Luo Jikui and Lu Binglin Sentenced to Death

    This newspaper reports that counter-revolutionary element Luo Jikui, who had murdered former Central Committee member of the CCP, Chen Tanqiu, and our party's senior cadres, Mao Zemin and Lin Jilu, was arrested on June 29, 1956. After the Anshan City Intermediate People's Court sentenced Luo to twenty years in prison, Luo appealed, and the Liaoning Provincial Higher People's Court upheld the original judgment. However, after the verdict, Luo refused to confess his guilt and submit to the law, and refused to reform. At the same time, the Liaoning Provincial Higher People's Court received letters from people in various places, unanimously believing that the sentence given to counter-revolutionary element Luo Jikui, who was guilty of so much blood debt, was too lenient and demanding severe suppression. The Liaoning Provincial Higher People's Court accepted the opinions of the people from various places and, in accordance with the provisions of the People's Court Organization Law, decided to revoke the original judgment after discussion by the adjudication committee, and re-tried the case. On October 25th of this year, Luo Jikui was re-sentenced to death, and after being reported to the Supreme People's Court of the People's Republic of China for approval, he was executed by firing squad on November 6th.

    Counter-revolutionary element Luo Jikui served as a junior lieutenant prison officer and captain prison warden in the Second Prison of the Public Security Administration of the Xinjiang Governor's Office from 1941 to 1944. In the autumn of 1943, while serving as prison warden, under the command of special agents and Li Yingqi, the director of the Public Security Administration, and other executioners such as prison officer Lu Binglin (also known as Lu Qingfu), he secretly strangled former Central Committee member of the CCP Chen Tanqiu and our party's senior cadres Mao Zemin and Lin Jilu with ropes in the middle of the night. During his tenure in reactionary posts, counter-revolutionary element Luo Jikui participated in the secret killing of Communist Party members and innocent people on eighteen occasions, with more than 250 people being killed. In each killing activity, in addition to personally strangling people with ropes, Luo Jikui actively participated in burying the bodies of the victims or burning the bodies with gasoline to destroy the evidence. Secondly, Luo Jikui abused prisoners in the prison, often beat them with wooden boards or whips, and sometimes forced them to kneel on cinder and hold tree branches. After liberation, Luo Jikui fled back to his hometown in Longjiang County, Heilongjiang Province, and lived in hiding. In 1951, he mixed into our basic construction department as a stone worker. In March 1953, he was transferred to the Anshan Iron and Steel Company Civil Engineering Company as a bricklayer. This counter-revolutionary element who killed revolutionary martyrs finally could not escape the people's justice and was duly punished.

    Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 17th. With the approval of the Supreme People's Court, the Gansu Provincial Higher People's Court and the Lanzhou City Intermediate People's Court jointly held a sentencing rally attended by more than 6,000 people on the 16th, sentencing counter-revolutionary element Lu Binglin (formerly known as Lu Qingfu), who brutally murdered former Central Committee member of the CCP Chen Tanqiu and Party's senior cadres Mao Zemin and Lin Jilu, to death, and the sentence has been carried out.

    Murderer Lu Binglin is a die-hard, consistently loyal to the reactionary government, and a blood-debt-ridden counter-revolutionary element. In August and September of 1943, while serving as a pseudo-Xinjiang Provincial prison officer, Lu, along with other executioners, personally strangled Chen Tanqiu, former Central Committee member of the CCP and CCP representative in Xinjiang, Mao Zemin, Director of the Finance Department of Xinjiang Province, and Lin Jilu, Dean of Studies of Xinjiang College, with ropes, and killed more than 300 progressive people and innocent people.

    After liberation, Lu mixed into the cadre training class of the Gansu Provincial Department of Commerce as a cook, and later, through private introduction, sneaked into the Lanzhou Workers' Cinema as a ticket clerk, attempting to continue counter-revolutionary activities. During the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement, after being reported by the masses and through extensive investigation by our public security department, he was finally identified, arrested, and brought to justice. However, due to the serious right-leaning thought that existed in the political and legal departments at one time, the Lanzhou City Intermediate People's Court only sentenced Lu to twenty years of imprisonment this June. When this news was announced, it aroused the indignation of people across the country, who wrote letters to the People's Daily, Gansu Daily, and the Lanzhou City Intermediate People's Court, criticizing the leniency towards the perpetrator and demanding a heavier sentence. The People's Court accepted the opinions of the masses, severely criticized right-leaning thought during the rectification campaign, and seriously revised the judgment of this case.

### 克服右倾思想　改判反革命案件  罗继魁卢秉林被判死刑

    克服右倾思想　改判反革命案件
    罗继魁卢秉林被判死刑
    本报讯　曾杀害过中共前中央委员陈潭秋和我党的高级干部毛泽民、林基路等同志的反革命分子罗继魁，于1956年6月29日被捕。经鞍山市中级人民法院判处罗犯二十年徒刑后，罗犯不服上诉，辽宁省高级人民法院维持了原判。但判决后，罗犯毫不认罪服法，拒绝改造。与此同时，辽宁省高级人民法院接到各地群众纷纷来信，一致认为对此血债累累的反革命分子罗继魁判处太轻，要求予以严厉镇压。辽宁省高级人民法院接受各地人民群众的意见，按人民法院组织法规定，经审判委员会讨论决定撤销了原判决，重新审理，于今年10月25日改判罗犯继魁死刑，并经报请中华人民共和国最高人民法院核准，于11月6日执行枪决。
    反革命分子罗继魁，从1941年到1944年间，曾充任新疆督办公署公安管理处第二监狱少尉监狱官、上尉监狱长等反动职务。1943年秋，罗继魁充任监狱长期间，在特务分子、公安管理处长李英奇等的指挥下，和监狱官卢秉林（又名卢庆福）等刽子手，乘深夜秘密用绳子将中共前中央委员陈潭秋和我党的高级干部毛泽民、林基路同志勒死。反革命分子罗继魁在任反动职务期间，曾先后参与秘密杀害共产党员和无辜群众十八次，有二百五十多人被害。罗继魁在每次杀人活动中除亲手用绳子勒人外，并积极参加掩埋被害人尸体或用汽油烧尸灭迹等活动。其次，罗继魁在监狱内对被押人员进行虐待，经常用木板子或鞭子拷打，并有时强逼被押人员跪煤渣举树棍。解放后罗继魁逃回原籍黑龙江省龙江县匿居，1951年混入我基本建设部门当打石工人，1953年3月被调到鞍山钢铁公司土建公司当瓦工。这个杀害革命烈士的反革命分子终于逃不出人民的法网而受到应有的制裁。
    新华社兰州17日电　甘肃省高级人民法院和兰州市中级人民法院报请最高人民法院批准，16日联合举行了有六千多人参加的宣判大会，判处惨杀中共前中央委员陈潭秋和党的高级干部毛泽民、林基路等的反革命分子卢秉林（原名卢庆福）以死刑，并已执行。
    杀人刽子手卢秉林是死心塌地、一贯为反动政府效忠的血债累累的反革命分子。1943年8、9月间，卢犯在任伪新疆省监狱官期间，和其他刽子手一道亲手用绳索勒死中共前中央委员、中共驻新疆代表陈潭秋，新疆省财政厅厅长毛泽民和新疆学院教务长林基路，并杀害进步人士、无辜群众等共三百多人。
    解放后，卢犯曾混入甘肃省商业厅干部训练班当炊事员，以后又经私人介绍钻进兰州市工人电影院作对号员，妄图继续进行反革命活动。在肃反运动中，经群众检举和我公安部门多方侦察，终于把他清查出来，依法逮捕归案。可是，由于政法部门一度存在着严重的右倾思想，兰州市中级人民法院在今年6月只给卢犯判处有期徒刑二十年。当这个消息公布后，引起了全国各地人民的义愤，他们纷纷写信给人民日报、甘肃日报和兰州市中级人民法院，批评对该犯过于宽大，要求重判。人民法院接受群众意见，在整风中严厉批判了右倾思想，将这一案件严肃地作了改判。
