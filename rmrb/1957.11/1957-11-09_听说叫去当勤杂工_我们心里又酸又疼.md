    Hearing We Are to Be Sent to Be Handymen, Our Hearts Ache
    After hearing the factory director's report on mobilizing apprentices to temporarily work as handymen, our hearts ache. Our calculations have been in vain, and our great ideals have been shattered. Of course, the cadres will say that all work is glorious, but why don't the factory director and cadres become handymen? We will never let our children become apprentices again! Beijing No. 1 Machine Tool Plant, Qunzhong Ming

    听说叫去当勤杂工  我们心里又酸又疼
    听了厂长关于动员学徒工暂时去做勤杂工的报告，我们的心又酸又疼。我们的心算白费了，我们伟大的理想被破坏了。当然，干部会说什么工作都光荣，可是为什么厂长、干部不去当杂工？我们决不让自己的子女再当徒工了！　北京第一机床厂　群众鸣
