    My Relationship with Chinese Characters
    Zhao Shuli
    Those who have studied the Confucian classics in their youth recognize the "official standard characters." The hardship of learning and practicing these characters in those years goes without saying. But once you discover their shortcomings and want to improve them, it becomes another ordeal.

    After learning the "official standard characters," I developed a rather deep affection for them. When writing articles or taking notes, I always felt uncomfortable not writing in this style, which made me much slower than others. Since the advocacy of simplified characters, I have been satisfied with the logic behind it. However, whenever I use a simplified character, I feel a certain imperfection emerging above it, and the energy spent on dealing with this feeling often exceeds the effort of writing a regular character. I am aware that this is a kind of inertia, but I have not been able to correct it for a long time. I really envy the children who are just starting school now—I predict that they will not develop this problem of mine.

    However, today's children can only be said to have gained a slight advantage compared to us back then (writing a few fewer strokes in some Chinese characters), while the pain of learning characters is still fundamentally there. I have a child in the first grade at home. What troubles this child during self-study time is the stroke order of writing characters—finding no pattern. I used to teach in elementary school, and naturally suffered a lot when teaching young children to write. I couldn't come up with a set of rules for the stroke order. I could only teach and write more, like my teachers taught me, so that they could find the patterns themselves through practice. Every time I see my child staring blankly at a new character with a pencil, I really want to say to him, "Don't bother learning that anymore, phonetic writing is about to be adopted!" But "about to" is not the same as "already," so I can't say that yet. I still have to act as a tutor and teach him the stroke order according to the old rules.

    In short, my feelings towards Chinese characters are inconsistent—on the one hand, I hope it will be reformed and replaced by phonetic writing as soon as possible, and on the other hand, I become its admirer when I use it myself. However, this admiration will never affect my enthusiasm for advocating reform—I believe that children should no longer be allowed to pick up my bad habits.

    我与汉字
    赵树理
    凡是幼读孔孟之书的人，都认的是“官板正字”。这种字，在当年认它、练它的时候，吃苦自不必说；而一旦发现它的缺点想改进一下，也会成为苦事。
    我自己在学了“官板正字”之后，对它发生了比较深厚的感情，在作文章、记笔记的时候，不写成这种字老觉着不洽于心，因此比别人在速度方面要差一大段时间。倡用简笔字以来，我在道理方面是满意的，只是自己一动笔使用个把简笔字，再往下写，总觉得上边产生了一点什么缺陷，为它耗去的精力，比写一个正字已经超过好多了。我自知这是一种惰性，但久久未能更正。我真羡慕现在才上学的儿童——预料他们不会产生我这种毛病。
    可是现在的儿童，只能说稍微比我们当时讨了一点便宜（在某些汉字上少写几画而已），而学字的痛苦基本上还在。我自己家里就有个小学一年级儿童。这孩子在自修时间，所苦的是写字的笔顺——找不着规律。我从前也教过小学，在教初年级儿童写字的时候自然也吃苦不小，对笔顺的规律也开不出一个条文来，只好像我的老师教我一样，多教、多写，让他们写得多了自己去找规律。我每看见孩子面对着生字，拿着铅笔楞楞地发愁的时候，真想对他说“不用学那个了，拼音文字快要被采用了！”只是“快”不等于“已经”，所以话还不能那么说，还只得作为个辅导教师按着老规矩教他笔顺。
    总之，我对汉字的感情是不统一的——一方面希望它早日改革而代之以拼音文字，另一方面在自己用它的时候又成了它的爱好者，不过这种爱好绝不影响到主张改革的积极性——我以为再不应该让孩子们染上我这种恶习。
