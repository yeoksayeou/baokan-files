Friendship's Flowers

    Friendship and Life
    As the great festival—the October Revolution Day—is approaching, I am especially reminded of those Soviet friends who worked so hard to win my second life.
    At this time last year, I was studying in Bezhitsa, Soviet Union. One Monday morning, the Soviet and Chinese students all went to class. I had just stepped out of the door when I fainted and fell to the ground. When I woke up, I was already lying on the bed in the school clinic. Soviet teachers, students, and staff crowded the entire room, all asking me with concern: "How do you feel?" At that time, I really felt like I was dreaming, and I didn't even know how I got to this place. Later, the Chinese students told me that when I fainted in the corridor, an old cleaning lady helped me up and sent me to the school clinic. The next morning, they sent me to a hospital in Moscow.
    In the hospital, the Soviet comrades created all the conditions for my recovery, making me feel as warm, comfortable, and happy as I was at home. I could eat rice and dumplings every day. The female director of the hospital always checked my condition once a day and often comforted and encouraged me to fight against the disease. Fearing that I would be bored, she often chatted with me about everyday life and sometimes told me stories about the lives and struggles of the Soviet people.
    Once, the lunch hour had passed, and a Soviet mother brought me a glass of fruit juice, touched my head, and said, "Child, eat it! Eating it will make you better! You are like my son in the Soviet Union, and isn't my son just like your mother's son working at the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant in China!" This motherly love made me shed tears of gratitude.
    Living in that big family full of friendship, my spirit improved day by day. I not only rested well every day, but also learned a lot from the Soviet people, making me feel like going to the hospital was like going to school again.
    Whenever I recall this extraordinary life experience, my heart beats again on the great Soviet land! (Li Xueguo)

### 友谊和生命

    友谊和生命
    当伟大的节日——十月革命节即将来临的时候，特别使我想起了那些为我夺来第二次生命而付出辛勤劳动的苏联朋友。
    去年此时，我正在苏联的贝日查学习。一个星期一的早晨，苏联同学和中国同学都上课去了，我刚迈出门就晕倒在地上，当我醒来时，早已躺在校医室的床上了。苏联的老师、同学、工作人员挤满了整个房间，他们都在关切地问我：“感觉怎样？”当时我真像做梦一样，还不知道怎样到这个地方来的。后来中国同学告诉我：当我晕倒在走廊里的时候，就被一位擦地板的老妈妈扶起来，送到了校医室里。第二天清早，就把我送进了莫斯科的一所医院了。
    在医院里，苏联同志为我创造了一切疗养的条件，使我像在家里一样的感到温暖、舒适和愉快。我每天都可以吃到大米饭和饺子。医院的女院长每天总要为我检查一次病情，并经常安慰我鼓励我向疾病作斗争。她怕我烦闷，还经常和我谈家常，有时讲苏联人民的生活斗争故事给我听。
    有一次，吃中饭的时间已经过了，一位苏联妈妈给我拿来一杯水果汁，摸着我的头说：“孩子，吃了吧！吃了病就好啦！你在苏联就和我的儿子一样，我的儿子在中国第一汽车制造厂工作不也和你妈妈的儿子一样吗！”这种慈母般的爱，使我感激得流下了眼泪。
    生活在那充满友谊的大家庭里，我的精神一天天好起来，每天不仅休息得很好，而且从苏联人的身上学得很多东西，使我觉得住一次医院仿佛又进了一次学校。
    每当我回忆起这一段不平凡的生活经历时，我的心就又跳动在伟大的苏维埃的土地上！　　（李学国）
