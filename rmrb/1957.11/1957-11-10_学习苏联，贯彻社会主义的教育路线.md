    Learning from the Soviet Union, Implementing the Socialist Education Line
    Ma Yinchu, President of Peking University

    The working people of the whole world are celebrating the great October Revolution's fortieth anniversary – a landmark festival – with extreme excitement. The October Revolution declared the end of capitalism and opened a glorious new socialist era for all mankind. Under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and inspired by the October Revolution, the Chinese people, after a long period of struggle, finally completed the people's democratic revolution and basically achieved the victory of the socialist revolution, thus entering a radiant socialist society. Remembering the source of our happiness, our people are unanimously grateful to the October Revolution for bringing us happiness.

    The October Revolution also brought new life to Peking University. Peking University, founded by the Qing Dynasty imperial family, was originally a school that served the feudal ruling class, instilling feudal and bourgeois culture. Shortly after the outbreak of the October Revolution in 1917, Marxism spread rapidly at Peking University. Our revolutionary pioneers (such as Comrade Li Dazhao) carried out Marxist theoretical activities at Peking University with unparalleled enthusiasm. Chairman Mao Zedong also actively engaged in the propaganda of Marxism at Peking University at that time. Thus, about a year and a half after the October Revolution, the May Fourth Movement, originating from Peking University, broke out, thus beginning the period of our people's democratic revolution. The Soviet people warmly celebrated the victory of our May Fourth Movement. Students of Moscow University at that time presented a banner to the students of Peking University, expressing revolutionary respect. Shortly after the May Fourth Movement, our first Marxist group was founded at Peking University, creating preparatory conditions for the establishment of the Chinese Communist Party in 1921. Obviously, just as the October Revolution brought a bright future to our people, the October Revolution also brought new life to Peking University.

    From the May Fourth Movement until the victory of the Liberation War, the revolutionary tradition that the October Revolution brought to Peking University never ceased. During that period, the progressive people of Peking University mainly participated in the revolutionary struggle under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. Because the regime was still in the hands of the reactionary class, it was impossible to implement the socialist education line at Peking University. Only after the victory of the people's democratic revolution and the people's grasp of political power, it was possible for Peking University to transform from an old university of a capitalist nature into a new socialist university, and to implement the socialist education line to serve our great socialist construction.

    Since the reorganization of departments in 1952, Peking University, under the leadership of the Party and the government and with the help of Soviet experts, has carried out a series of teaching reforms. The teaching reforms at Peking University, like those in other institutions of higher learning across the country, have achieved great success. The teaching reforms are going very well, not at all as the rightists have slandered: "very bad." Through several years of teaching reforms, the teaching work of Peking University has been reorganized organizationally in accordance with the principles of meeting the needs of socialist construction. Each major and each course has a teaching plan and syllabus that can guarantee the quality of teaching. All teachers are working hard to do a good job of teaching through teaching and research sections, helping each other, and pooling their wisdom.

    However, can we say that the socialist education line has been thoroughly implemented at Peking University? We cannot say that yet. This May, the rightists in Peking University and other institutions of higher learning rampantly attacked the socialist line of the institutions of higher learning, attempting to make the institutions of higher learning return to the capitalist line. These reactionary words and deeds of theirs once deceived the sympathy of some of the masses at the time. Isn't this enough to show that the socialist education line has not been truly implemented in the institutions of higher learning, especially in the minds of some teachers and students? After several months of the anti-rightist struggle, the political reactionary activities of the rightists have been fully exposed and refuted, but because the thinking of some teachers and students has been influenced by bourgeois ideology to varying degrees, the thorough implementation of the socialist education line cannot but be a relatively long-term and rather arduous task.

    The attack by the rightists has given us a very good lesson, that is: we must give the greatest importance to the task of implementing the socialist education line. At present, Peking University, together with other institutions of higher learning, under the leadership of the Party, is taking various necessary measures to more effectively implement the socialist education line, such as: thoroughly completing the anti-rightist struggle, carrying out systematic and in-depth socialist ideological education among students and staff, implementing the policy of running schools diligently and thriftily, and mobilizing the masses to participate in labor production, etc. It is believable that through these measures, Peking University can be run better.

    The Soviet institutions of higher learning are a brilliant example for our institutions of higher learning. In order to thoroughly implement the socialist education line, we must continue to adhere to the policy of "learning from the Soviet Union" and better integrate it with our country's reality. The unparalleled superiority of the socialist education system has been well proven in the vigorous development of the Soviet scientific and cultural undertakings. The recent successful launch of the Soviet artificial satellite is enough to prove that the Soviet Union's scientific level is at the forefront of the world in many aspects. Only by learning from the Soviet Union better can we improve our country's scientific and cultural level at the fastest speed and ensure the smooth realization of our country's twelve-year science plan.

    On the occasion of celebrating the fortieth anniversary of the great October Revolution, Peking University deeply thanks the Soviet people, because the October Revolution has brought us new life; because we have achieved great victories in the teaching reforms due to learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and the enthusiastic help of the Soviet experts; because the Soviet universities have provided us with a guiding light to advance towards socialism. We can only thank the Soviet people for their noble friendship and great assistance to us by learning from the Soviet Union better, thoroughly implementing the socialist education line, making Peking University advance along the socialist road, and sending more and better qualified specialists to the motherland.

    学习苏联，贯彻社会主义的教育路线
    北京大学校长　马寅初
    全世界的劳动人民怀着极其兴奋的心情来欢呼伟大的十月革命四十周年这一划时代的节日。十月革命宣告了资本主义的末日并为全人类开辟了光辉的社会主义新时代。中国人民在十月革命的感召下，在中国共产党正确领导下，经过长期斗争，终于完成了人民民主革命并基本上取得了社会主义革命的胜利，从而进入了光芒万丈的社会主义社会。我国人民饮水思源，齐声感谢十月革命给我们带来了幸福。
    十月革命也给北京大学带来了新的生命。清朝皇室所创办的北京大学，原来是一所为封建统治阶级服务的，灌输封建阶级与资产阶级文化的学校。在1917年十月革命爆发以后不久，马克思主义在北京大学迅速地传播开来。我国的革命先进人士（如李大钊同志等）以无比的热情在北京大学进行马克思主义的理论活动。毛泽东主席当时也在北京大学积极地进行了马克思主义的宣传活动。于是，在十月革命以后大约一年半的时间，以北京大学为发祥地的五四运动爆发了，从而开始了我国人民民主革命的时期。苏维埃人民热烈地庆贺我国五四运动的胜利，莫斯科大学的学生当时曾向北京大学的学生赠送了一面锦旗，表示革命的敬意。在五四运动以后不久，我国第一个马克思主义小组在北京大学创立，为1921年中国共产党的建立创造了准备条件。显而易见，正像十月革命给我国人民带来光明的前程一样，十月革命也给北京大学带来了新的生命。
    从五四运动开始直到解放战争胜利三十年的历史中，十月革命所带给北京大学的革命传统未尝中断。在那个时期中，北京大学的进步人士主要是在中国共产党的领导下，参加了革命斗争，由于政权还在反动阶级的掌握中，要在北京大学贯彻社会主义的教育路线是不可能的。只有在人民民主革命胜利、人民掌握了政权之后，北京大学才有可能从资本主义性质的旧大学改造成为社会主义的新型大学，才有可能来贯彻社会主义的教育路线，来为我国伟大的社会主义建设服务。
    从1952年院系调整以来，北京大学在党和政府的领导下，在苏联专家的帮助下，进行了一系列的教学改革。北京大学的教学改革，正像全国其他高等学校一样，取得了极大的成绩。教学改革搞得好得很，完全不是像右派分子所诬蔑的那样：“糟得很”。通过几年来的教学改革，北京大学的教学工作已经在符合社会主义建设需要的原则下进行了在组织上的整顿。各个专业各个课程都有了能保证教学质量的教学计划和教学大纲。全体教师正通过教研室这种组织，相互帮助，群策群力地为做好教学工作而努力。
    但是，能不能说社会主义的教育路线在北京大学已经贯彻得很好了呢？还不能这样说。今年5月，北京大学以及其他高等学校中的右派分子猖狂地向高等学校的社会主义路线进攻，图谋使高等学校走回资本主义的路线。他们这些反动言行在当时曾骗得了一部分群众的同情，这难道还不足以说明社会主义的教育路线在高等学校中，尤其在一部分师生的思想中并没有得到真正的贯彻吗？经过几个月来的反右派斗争，右派分子这种政治性的反动活动是被充分揭发和驳斥了，但是由于一部分教师和学生的思想在不同的程度上受了资产阶级思想的影响，因此，要彻底地贯彻社会主义教育路线不能不是比较长期的、相当艰巨的任务。
    右派的进攻，使我们得到了很好的经验教训，那就是：必须对贯彻社会主义教育路线的任务，予以最大的重视。目前，北京大学和其他高等学校一起，在党的领导下，正采取各种必要的措施来更有效地贯彻社会主义的教育路线，例如：彻底完成反右派斗争，在学生和工作人员中进行系统而深入的社会主义思想教育、贯彻勤俭办学的方针以及动员群众参加劳动生产等等。可以相信，通过这些措施，可以使北京大学办得更好。
    苏联的高等学校是我国高等学校的光辉榜样，为了彻底地贯彻社会主义的教育路线，我们必须继续坚持“学习苏联”的方针，并且更好地与我国实际相结合。社会主义教育制度的无比优越性，已经在苏联科学文化事业的蓬勃发展中得到了很好的证明。最近苏联人造卫星发射成功，足以证明苏联的科学水平在许多方面已居世界之冠。我们只有更好地学习苏联，才能以最快的速度提高我国的科学文化水平，才能保证我国十二年科学规划的顺利实现。
    在庆祝伟大十月革命四十周年之际，北京大学深深感谢苏联人民，因为十月革命给我们带来了新的生命；因为由于学习苏联的先进经验和苏联专家们的热情帮助使我们在教学改革中取得很大的胜利；因为苏联的大学为我们提供了向社会主义前进的指路明灯。我们唯有更好地学习苏联，彻底地贯彻社会主义的教育路线，使北京大学沿着社会主义道路大步前进，为祖国输送数量更多、质量更好的专门人才，才能答谢苏联人民对我们的崇高的友谊和伟大的援助。
