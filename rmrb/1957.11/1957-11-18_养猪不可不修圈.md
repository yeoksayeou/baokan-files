The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council issued a decision on September 24 regarding launching a large-scale farmland water conservancy and fertilizer accumulation campaign this winter and spring. This decision pointed out that actively and extensively building farmland water conservancy is the most effective fundamental measure to expand agricultural production, increase yield per unit area, and prevent drought and flood disasters; it also pointed out that accumulating and applying more fertilizer is a reliable way to ensure increased production.

There are many sources of fertilizer, but raising pigs to accumulate fertilizer is a very important way to increase fertilizer. The experience of many regions has proven that attaching importance to the utilization of this fertilizer can increase the amount of fertilizer applied. For example, the Wu'ai Agricultural Cooperative in Huimin County, Shandong Province, fully utilized pig manure, increasing the application of pig manure to three carts per mu this year, and the yield per mu increased to four hundred catties.

According to the experiments of the North China Agricultural Science Research Institute, the manure of one pig can increase grain production by 150 catties. According to the experience of old farmers in Wangcheng County, Hunan Province, the manure of one pig can increase rice production by about 300 catties. Furthermore, according to statistics from eleven agricultural cooperatives in Hunan, Hubei, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hebei, Henan, Shandong, and other provinces, the manure of each pig can increase grain production by an average of 288 catties per year, and up to 400 catties. It can be seen that applying the manure of one pig to the land can increase grain production by 200 to 300 catties, which is entirely possible. In the first half of this year, the number of pigs in the country developed greatly. Currently, there are more than 118 million pigs in the country. Calculated at 200 catties of grain increase per pig, grain production can be increased by 23.6 billion catties.

At present, many areas do not have pig pens for raising pigs, and the habit of letting pigs roam freely is still relatively common. For example, in provinces such as Guangxi and Henan, 60-70% of pig farmers do not have pig pens, and in most provinces, about 50% of pig farmers do not have pig pens. Because there are no pens for raising pigs, a large amount of pig manure and urine is lost. Estimating that 40% of the country's pigs do not have pens, the annual loss of grain production due to this fertilizer loss is more than 9 billion catties. What a huge loss this is!

Having pens for raising pigs can not only accumulate fertilizer but also prevent the spread of pig diseases. In recent years, many regions have attached importance to this work and have achieved certain results. In recent years, Hubei Province has vigorously called on the masses to raise pigs, build pens, accumulate fertilizer, and prevent epidemics, and has educated the masses to consciously build pens and accumulate fertilizer by calculating three accounts (the fertilizer loss account, the impact on production increase account, and the dead pig loss account). In 1956, Huanggang Prefecture in the province built 17,590 pig pens. Many other provinces have also achieved certain results in this area. According to incomplete statistics from Heilongjiang Province in 1956, more than 288,000 new and renovated pig pens were built throughout the province. Gansu Province requires that by this winter and spring, pig raising should basically be done with pens in all agricultural areas of the province. Zhejiang Province plans to incorporate the construction of pig pens as a system in the plains area in conjunction with pig insurance. The practices of these regions are worth learning.

While mobilizing the masses to build pig pens, we must also try to solve the specific problems of building pens. At present, most pigs are privately owned and raised by commune members. Commune members may encounter problems such as lack of funds, materials, and labor when building pens. Agricultural cooperatives should adopt methods such as "self-construction with public assistance" and "helping with labor and supplementing materials" to help commune members solve these problems.

In order to raise pigs, build pens, and accumulate fertilizer, the purchase price of commune members' pig manure must be reasonable, otherwise, it will dampen the enthusiasm of commune members to accumulate more fertilizer and affect the development of pen construction and fertilizer accumulation work.

Winter and spring are the best seasons to mobilize commune members to raise pigs, build pens, and accumulate fertilizer. We must not miss the opportunity. (Attached picture)

The Qingchun Agricultural Cooperative in Tuqiao Township, Tong County, Hebei Province, has established a pig farm, raising more than 100 sows. In addition to producing more than 2,000 piglets each year, the farm can also accumulate a lot of fertilizer. The picture shows a corner of the pigsty. Liu Ming and Ke Zhang (photographers)

    养猪不可不修圈
    郭金城
    中共中央、国务院9月24日发布了关于今冬明春大规模地开展农田水利和积肥运动的决定。这个决定指出积极广泛地兴修农田水利是扩大农业生产，提高单位面积产量，防止旱涝灾害最有效的一项根本措施；同时指出多积肥多施肥是保证增产的可靠办法。
    肥料的来源是很多的，但养猪积肥是增加肥料的一项极为重要的途径。很多地区的经验证明，重视这项肥料的利用，就可以增加施肥的数量。如山东省惠民县五爱农业社，由于充分地利用猪的粪肥，今年每亩地能施猪肥增加到三车，每亩产量就增加到四百斤。
    根据华北农业科学研究所的试验，一头猪的粪肥可增产粮食一百五十斤。按照湖南省望城县老农经验，一头猪的粪肥可增产稻谷三百斤左右。又据湖南、湖北、江苏、浙江、河北、河南、山东等省十一个农业社的资料统计，每头猪的粪肥，每年平均可增产粮食二百八十八斤，最多可到四百斤。由此可见，把一头猪的粪肥施到地里，增产二、三百斤粮食是完全可能的。今年上半年全国生猪有了很大的发展，目前全国有猪一亿一千八百多万头，以每头猪粪增产粮食二百斤计算，可增产粮食二百三十六亿斤。
    目前很多地区养猪没有猪圈，放野猪的习惯还比较普遍。如广西、河南等省有60—70％的养猪户没有猪圈，大部分省有50％左右的养猪户没有猪圈。由于养猪没圈，大量的猪粪尿都流失掉了。以目前全国猪只有40％没有猪圈推算，每年由于这项肥料损失而少产的粮食，就有九十多亿斤。这是多么大的损失啊！
    养猪有圈不但可以积攒肥料，同时还可以防止猪疫传播。近年来有不少地区已经重视了这项工作，并取得一定的成绩。湖北省近几年来大力号召群众养猪修圈积肥、防疫，并通过算三笔账（算肥料损失账、影响增产账、死猪损失账）的方法，教育群众自觉地修圈积肥。该省黄冈专区1956年就修圈一万七千五百九十个。其他许多省在这方面也有一定的成绩。据黑龙江省1956年不完全统计，全省共新修和改修的猪圈有二十八万八千多个。甘肃省要求今冬明春全省农区基本上做到养猪有圈。浙江省准备在平原区结合生猪保险将修圈规定为一项制度。这些地区的作法都是值得学习的。
    在发动群众修建猪圈的同时，还要尽量设法解决修圈的具体问题。目前绝大部分猪只都是社员私有、私养。社员在修圈时，可能碰到缺乏资金、器材和劳动力等问题。农业社应该采取“自修公助”“帮工补料”等办法，协助社员解决这些问题。
    为了养猪修圈积肥，收买社员猪粪价格必须合理，不然就会挫伤社员多积肥料的积极性，影响到修圈积肥工作的开展。
    冬、春是发动社员养猪修圈积肥的最好季节，我们切莫要错过时机。（附图片）
