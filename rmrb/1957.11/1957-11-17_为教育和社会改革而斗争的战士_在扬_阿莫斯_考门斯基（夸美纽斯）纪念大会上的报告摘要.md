    A Fighter for Education and Social Reform
    -- Excerpts from a Report at the Jan Amos Comenius Commemorative Conference
    Czech Educator Dr. Erwen Guoerkaer
    Comenius is not only an outstanding figure of the Czech nation, but is also regarded as a world-renowned outstanding thinker and reformer of the early modern period. The World Peace Council's inclusion of Jan Amos Comenius in cultural commemorative activities is, in our opinion, significant beyond being merely a tribute to a Czech thinker of the early medieval period, who lived in the suffering years of the Thirty Years' War and dedicated himself to peace and international cooperation. Comenius lives in the hearts of progressive people all over the world because his educational ideas, which are closely linked to social reform, far transcend the historical scope of the seventeenth century in which he lived, and only in the socialist society of the future will favorable conditions be provided for the realization of these educational ideas.
    Undoubtedly, Comenius is a great and complex figure. Recent scientific research has clarified the social and economic background of Comenius's works, and newly discovered materials ("Comprehensive Reform") tell us that Comenius was more complex and greater than we originally imagined. Therefore, it is impossible to cover all aspects of Jan Amos Comenius as an educator, philosopher, social critic, and reformer in one speech. I will only talk here about Comenius as an ordinary person and a social critic.
    For the greater part of his time, Comenius lived and worked in the seventeenth century, a period which, especially after the failure of the Czech noble rebellion against the Habsburg dynasty - the Battle of White Mountain in 1620 - marked the beginning of a national, social and cultural disaster for the Czech people, a disaster that lasted for three hundred years. Due to the persecution by the reactionary Habsburg dynasty, Czech non-Catholic intellectuals, including Comenius, had to flee abroad. He was forced to flee abroad not only because he was a priest of the non-Catholic Brethren denomination, but also as a patriot and political thinker.
    In Comenius's works and speeches, we often encounter ideological differences arising from his different understanding of viewpoints. It is unscientific to conceal this. His thought stems on the one hand from practical reason, and on the other hand from religious belief. The polarization of the thinker's cognitive viewpoints at the turning point between the Middle Ages and modern times aroused intense inner struggles in Comenius, prompting him to strive for a harmonious society, and to seek the laws of social life, education, and natural phenomena. Therefore, although Comenius remained a faithful believer in the Czech Brethren denomination until his death, on the other hand, he treated things, phenomena and their interrelationships, and people, with a very clear scientific attitude. This contradiction occurred in the period of transition between the Middle Ages and modern times, and is also a characteristic of his thought. He was both a man of feudal society and already a man of the new society of the future.
    In Comenius's writings and personality, the characteristics of medieval people using religion and science to explain things and modern people using only science to explain things are intertwined. The difficulty in scientifically understanding the image of Comenius, and faithfully and correctly understanding the complexity of his progressive and backward sides, lies in this.
    Comenius sought refuge in God, which is the thought of medieval people, but the modern way of thinking had already permeated his medieval religious worldview. This is particularly clear in his conviction that it is futile to stubbornly adhere to religious dogma and his advocacy of religious tolerance. These two points made his fellow Protestants uneasy and aroused the distrust of pious Protestant theologians towards him.
    In his attitude of thoroughly understanding things, Comenius showed a modern non-dogmatic scientific method of thinking, which is certainly more difficult and requires more labor. But he was willing to pay the price of active, tireless hard work for it. This quality is also the traditional spirit of the Czech Brethren denomination.
    This tireless and admirable diligence is the basic characteristic of Comenius's personality. It is because of this labor, coupled with his genius as a creative thinker, that we can explain why he, although he did not, and was unwilling to engage in hasty writing, often made revisions after it was written; and why he left behind a huge number of works (a total of more than two hundred and fifty-six large and small volumes).
    The tenacity of his work not only prevented the work from being superficial, but also made him often rethink, think about those works that had already been written and published. He believed that there was nothing that was absolutely perfect, flawless, and did not need to be revised with a critical eye. Comenius had a creative way of thinking that constantly sought more thorough and perfect, which is already the way of thinking of modern thinkers.
    Comenius's self-critical spirit of responsibility for his work is also one of the characteristics of his personality. When he was preparing to publish the complete collection of "Educational Treatises" (published in Amsterdam in 1657-1658, we are commemorating its 300th anniversary), he conducted strict self-criticism and revision. He believed that it was the natural duty of any loyal person to correct errors that would harm others. Because he wanted to remove the tares and preserve the grain, and eliminate the false and retain the true in his own writings, he used the image of a farmer's winnowing fan in the book "Sprout of Wisdom" when removing tares from grain. Comenius, as if he had accepted our dialectical epistemology, believed that the recognition of truth must go through the process of error and overcoming error, so he was opposed to authoritarianism and dogmatism.
    Comenius loved people, especially his own Czech people, so he was very concerned about their education. He saw education as one of the important methods for national survival. He emphasized that education should not be limited to a few people in the nation who understand Latin. He saw in the more economically developed countries of Western Europe that educating in the national language could also enable the broad masses of the citizens and handicraftsmen to have access to education, but the Czech Republic lacked this condition. Therefore, his first pedagogical work written in Czech was primarily devoted to the development of Czech education.
    One of Comenius's noble qualities, his love for his native language, is not only expressed in his own writing in his native language and his call for Czech intellectuals to write in Czech, but also in the fact that, as one of the founders of the development of national education, he could see that the national language should be used as the language of education. To this end, he began to collect vocabulary and compile the dictionary "Czech Treasury" to show the richness of the Czech vocabulary. Comenius's love for the Czech people and the Czech language is intertwined with his love for the motherland.
    When he learned in 1649 that the Swedish Prime Minister Oxenstierna felt insulted by his constant attention to Sweden's responsibility to the Czech nation, he wrote a letter to the Prime Minister, expressing that the suffering of the nation was his own suffering. He wrote: "The suffering that I told you about was not my personal suffering, but the suffering of the public. It is not I or my companions who share the same faith who have been abandoned, but the entire nation." Comenius also firmly believed that history would be able to draw a just conclusion. When he saw some people abandoning the Czech nation, he still firmly believed that these people would eventually realize that the freedom of one's own nation could not be exchanged at the cost of the enslavement of other nations, and that if other nations were enslaved and oppressed, one's own nation would never benefit from it. From this, it can be seen that Comenius's idea of serving his own people has developed into the idea of serving mankind. Comenius's patriotism has developed into an effort to reform the entire society, to demand a more humane and just system, and to demand comprehensive reform. He wanted to achieve comprehensive reform by implementing comprehensive education, the result of which would bring lasting peace to the world.
    Now I would like to talk about Comenius's idea of reforming society. He recognized the crisis and decay of the collapsing feudal society, and then his idea of reforming society was born. His development process of the idea of reforming society is reflected in his works, from "Letters to Heaven", through "Labyrinth", "The Way of Light", to "The Happiness of the Nation" and "Comprehensive Reform".
    Undeniably, in Comenius's early thinking, the views on social issues showed obvious contradictions and hesitations. On the one hand, we cannot one-sidedly think that his thoughts are all progressive and without reservation, but on the other hand, we cannot mechanically treat the contradictions in his thoughts, thinking that this contradiction is always the same in all of Comenius's works and actions, as if the contradiction in his thoughts is a permanent mark. Such a view would lead to a mechanical understanding of Comenius and a simple and crude treatment of Comenius's views on social issues. The contradictions in his thoughts cannot be explained only conceptually, saying that this is a reflection of the turning point of the times in which he lived in his thoughts, because such a conceptual explanation would make us ignore the fierce struggle between the new and the old that took place in Comenius's heart. This struggle made him recognize the more real reasons for the collapse of feudal society, that is, the economic life had changed, and capitalist relations had grown in the collapsing feudal system. Comenius personally saw this relationship in his exile abroad. Using Marx's historical point of view of development to analyze the political events in Europe at that time, we can more clearly understand how Comenius appeared as a spokesperson, and even a defender, of the feudal order in most cases in his early period, but the more he went later, the more firmly he became a combatant critic of the collapsing feudal system, and became a propagandist and defender of democratic thought.
    When the young Comenius was still a pastor in Fulnek (a place name in the Czech Republic), he began to consider social issues. This can be found in the "Letters to Heaven" published in Olomouc (the central city of the Moravian region of the Czech Republic) in 1619. In these letters, Comenius is still manifested as the maintainer of the feudal aristocratic order, although in some places there have been accusations of the shortcomings and contradictions within the feudal society. The book also lacks a democratic spirit, and there is no attempt to solve social inequality beyond the scope of religion. We cannot find in the book the tradition of the radical revolutionary spirit of the Taborites inheriting the Hussite movement.
    Comenius's social views in "The Labyrinth of the World" are still similarly bound by the feudal ideas as we saw in "Letters to Heaven," although he correctly and increasingly urgently sees the signs of the impending collapse of the feudal system. He focuses on pointing out the chaos and shortcomings of the power organs, the defects of the legislative system and the dignity of the law, and the shame of the clergy degenerating into specializing in collecting money, ... "It is wrong to call those people priests, now they should be called 'money fathers'." Comenius sarcastically uses terms such as "braggarts, weevils, bad guys, and shysters..." to portray the images of some law enforcement officers who specialize in collecting money and are in charge of upholding the law and justice. Comenius constantly sees the best way to reform the social system at that time in "The Labyrinth of the World," in the Gospels and religious humility, and in the attitude of non-contention with the world that a good Christian should have in the secular Babylon of all modern times. For Comenius, this is the only possible way from "The Labyrinth of the World" to "The Garden of the Heart."
    But what Comenius sees in another place in "The Labyrinth" is still worth noting: he also feels that the self-deceptive saying that secular injustice and the disparity between the rich and the poor are temporary can never completely satisfy the poor, because the inequality and injustice suffered by the poor in this world are really too heavy. So here (Chapter 32) we come across Comenius's ideas with a spirit of renewal; he says that the social system in this world does not exclude any poor people. He writes: "Everyone should not miss the opportunity to take any path to save themselves from poverty."
    Even if the combativeness and democracy in "The Labyrinth of the World" are only isolated factors, I still understand this factor as an early recognition of the further development of Comenius's views on society, which can be confirmed in his later works, such as "The Way of Light," "The Happiness of the Nation," "Angel of Peace," and the most outstanding "Comprehensive Reform."
    I think "The Way of Light" (1641-42) is another stage in the development of Comenius's social views. This book was written during Comenius's stay in England, and was only published in 1668; in which can be seen his noteworthy suggestions for the establishment of a world academy of sciences and the compilation of a world language. "Witnessing the contradictions of society leads to the diagnosis of social disputes. If the whole of society is not rotten, you will be in vain to improve anything from the parts that have already been corrected..." (page 32) At that time, Comenius not only saw the unreasonable consequences of the feudal system being manifested in the sharpness of class contradictions; he analyzed more deeply, looking for the reasons why society was not improving, and he discovered this reason in the bad political foundation, so to speak, in the bad political theory on which the feudal system was built. Comenius wrote: I must speak frankly, the main political theory supported by the current ruling class is only a trick of the eye, and is the real reason for social unrest. The understanding of the cause leads Comenius to seek ways of reform. He said: "... the constraints of incorrect, deeply rooted habits are very tight, and cannot be broken without great courage." This is one of the reliable documents proving that Comenius, who in "The Labyrinth" still took not rejecting evil as a principle of salvation, has been liberated from the passivity of religious pacifism.
    It is worth noting that Comenius in this period did not expect the representatives or theorists of the church to reform society. He believed that social reform was the task of the holders of world power, the "political rulers." ("The Way of Light" Preface Section 27)
    In his work "The Happiness of the Nation," Comenius first faces the democratic demand for "universal freedom" that belongs to all the people and is not exclusive to the rulers. Related to "universal freedom" is a further democratic demand, that is, the demand that the law must belong to all the people, and the law must be in line with the interests of all the people. He demanded that the state power should have the participation of peasants and citizens. Here, Comenius seems to have crossed the structural scope of the medieval monarchy. The concept of the monarchy has been completely overcome in the book "Comprehensive Reform." He does not distinguish the social classes by the feudal hierarchy, but by occupation.
    In "The Happiness of the Nation," Comenius's view of labor as the natural duty of all the people, regardless of rank, is full of distinct democratic colors. He believes that a model society should not have the suffering of unemployment, everyone must work, and power should only be imposed on those who are unwilling to work. He understands labor as an obligation, as a panacea for laziness, but here he mistakenly regards laziness as the source of national chaos.
    In 1667 (Comenius lived in Amsterdam from 1656 to 1670), he wrote "Angel of Peace," which involved the event of the British and Dutch envoys discussing peace in Branda. In Amsterdam, he had the opportunity to see the vigorous development of commercial capital, but this did not dazzle him. On the contrary, he revealed the shadow of wealth concentration. He fiercely opposed the exploitation of business owners and warned them with punishment. As an idealist, he saw such a social system:
  "In this society, everyone works and everyone enjoys the fruits of their labor."
      "Comprehensive Reform" is the most important (fifth) part of Comenius's culminating comprehensive work "General Suggestions for the Comprehensive Reform of Human Affairs," which means a further development of Comenius's research on society's views. Comenius himself did not publish the entire "Comprehensive Reform." First of all, according to friendly predictions, the chapters that were bound to cause opposition and attacks from conservative groups in the society at that time were not published, because those chapters involved guaranteeing world peace, reforming the church, and reforming the national system.
      In my opinion, the work "Comprehensive Reform" - as I have tried to point out - can be listed as Comenius's most insightful social views, which have been prepared and brewing in Comenius's previous works. Compared with Comenius's social views in the earlier period, the difference is that the views in the later period are more specific, clearer and more resolute.
    In "Comprehensive Reform," we can also find the components of Comenius's early democratic thoughts, which are more vividly expressed in the later convincing essays.
    As the legitimate demand for "culture for all" put forward in "The Great Didactic" is emphasized again in "Comprehensive Reform": all young people should receive formal education without exception, "Even the children of the poorest families should not be treated as rotten wood and not carved...".
    Democratic thoughts are also expressed in the suggestions for adjusting civic relations and social management systems. Comenius put forward the idea of "regional system," that is, each region in each county sends its own representatives to meet regularly every month to discuss and solve some common matters. If the issue involves the whole state, it can be resolved at the municipal representative meeting in the capital. As for the relationship between culture and education, church affairs, civic life and economic issues, they can all be undertaken by newspapers. In his words, newspapers should be "tools for spreading culture and wisdom."
    His suggestions also include democratic demands for public service: the authorities should care about the construction of public buildings, and there should be hospitals, orphanages, poorhouses, nursing homes, etc. near the school. The authorities should also find ways to make it feasible for the children of poor people to go to school; we can think that the demand for "culture for all" in "The Great Didactic" is also an economic consideration in theoretical principle.
    I think the above-mentioned documents related to Comenius's democratic thoughts are enough to illustrate that Comenius not only did not deviate from the progressive path in his own ideological development process, but also thoroughly and specifically supplemented and developed his idea of reforming the world order in his masterpiece "Comprehensive Reform." Comenius overcame the firm religious passivity in his early works such as "Letters to Heaven" and part of "The Labyrinth of the World," some of which were already obvious in "The Happiness of the Nation." In "Comprehensive Reform," Comenius appeared more resolute and uncompromising.
    In the work "Angel of Peace," his idea of social reform is combined with the idea of maintaining world peace. In it, we can see the criticism of selfishness and greed that sees profit and forgets righteousness. In the process of finding the roots of all social chaos at that time, mainly wars, Comenius realized that the main reasons for wars and social chaos lie in the struggle for power and the struggle for markets and interests. When he saw that the back of all wars was precisely that vulgar motive of greed, he could not help but raise an angry protest.
    Of course, Comenius was able to distinguish between what is a war of plunder and what is a just war; in a just war, weapons are not tools of violence, but tools of justice, and a just war is not for hegemony and power, but to defend justice. This view can be evidenced by Comenius's letter of tribute to the Dutch captain in February 1658 (this letter is attached to the "Complete Collection of Educational Treatises").
    This view is the natural conclusion of the ideological origin of Comenius's "Comprehensive Reform" and "Angel of Peace." Comenius not only did not stand idly by, but bravely developed his ideas of peace and comprehensive reform. His efforts for peace and comprehensive reform aimed at striving for a society "without beasts preying on the weak, without demons inflicting war on people, and without gangsters harming others and benefiting themselves." Although Comenius himself tasted the pain of exile and displacement abroad in the chaotic society at that time, and although he was greatly disappointed after returning to China, he still firmly believed in the possibility of lasting peace, and he still taught tirelessly for his optimistic belief. His boundless love for mankind, his great belief in mankind and human progress and development are worthy of admiration.

    为教育和社会改革而斗争的战士
    ——在扬·阿莫斯·考门斯基（夸美纽斯）纪念大会上的报告摘要
    捷克斯洛伐克教育家  爱尔文·郭尔卡尔博士
    夸美纽斯不仅是捷克民族杰出的人物，而且也被认为是近代初期的世界闻名的杰出的思想家和改革家。世界和平理事会把扬·阿莫斯·考门斯基列入文化纪念活动中，我们认为它的意义还不限于是对一位中世纪初期，生活在三十年战争的苦难年代里，致力于和平和国际合作的捷克思想家的崇敬。夸美纽斯是活在全世界进步人类的心里的，因为他的和社会改革紧密联系的教育思想远远超越了他生活的十七世纪的历史范围，而只有在未来的社会主义社会才提供实现这种教育思想的有利条件。
    无可置疑，夸美纽斯是伟大而复杂的人物。由于近年来的科学研究弄清了夸美纽斯作品的社会、经济背景，以及新发现的材料（全面改革）告诉我们，夸美纽斯要比我们原来想像的更为复杂和伟大。因此，不可能在一次演讲里涉及作为教育家、哲学家、社会批评家和改革家的扬·阿莫斯·考门斯基的多方面事迹。我仅在这里谈谈作为一个普通的人和社会批评家的夸美纽斯的形象。
    夸美纽斯的极大部分的时间都生活和工作在十七世纪，这个时期，特别是在捷克贵族反哈布斯皇朝起义——1620年白山战役——失败之后，对捷克人民来说，是一场民族、社会与文化的大灾难的开始，这场灾难加在捷克人民头上长达三百年之久。由于反动的哈布斯皇朝的迫害，捷克的非天主教知识分子，其中包括夸美纽斯，必须逃亡到国外去。他不仅仅因为是非天主教的兄弟会教派的教士而被迫逃亡国外，他是作为一个爱国者和政治思想家而逃亡的。
    我们在夸美纽斯的作品和讲话里常能遇见由于他的不同的认识观点而产生的思想上的分歧，要掩盖这点是不科学的。他的思想一方面是从实际出发的理智，另一方面却是宗教信仰。在中古和近代两个时期转折点的思想家认识观点的两极分化引起夸美纽斯内心的激烈斗争，促使他努力寻求协调的社会，寻求社会生活、教育和自然现象的规律。所以夸美纽斯虽然直到临终时还是捷克兄弟会教派的忠实信徒，但在另一方面却以非常明确的科学态度来对待事物、现象及其相互关系和对待人。这种矛盾发生在中古和近代交替时期，同时也是他的思想特征。他既是封建社会的人，同时又已经是未来新社会的人。
    在夸美纽斯的著作和人格里都交织着中世纪人用宗教和科学来解释事物和近代人只用科学来解释事物的特点。科学地认识夸美纽斯的形象，忠实而正确地认识他的进步一面与落后一面的复杂性和困难即在于此。
    夸美纽斯在上帝那里找避难所，这是中世纪人的思想，但是，近代人的思想方法已浸入了他的中世纪人的宗教世界观。这在他深信死守宗教教条的徒劳无益并主张宗教的宽容这两点看得特别清楚。这两点曾使他的同道，基督新教徒感到不安，并引起虔信的基督新教神学家对他的不信任。
    在彻底认识事物的态度上，夸美纽斯显示了近代非教条的科学思想方法，这种方法当然比较困难并需要多花劳动。但他是宁愿为此而付出积极的、不倦的艰苦劳动。这种品质也是捷克兄弟会教派的传统精神。
    这种不知疲倦的、令人敬佩的勤劳正是夸美纽斯人格的基本特征，由于这种劳动，再加上他那创造性的思想家的天才，才能解释为什么他虽然不会，也不愿草率地从事写作，但在写成后还常加修改；才能解释为什么他留下了数量巨大的著作（一共超过二百五十六本大大小小的册籍）。
    他的工作的坚韧性不仅防止了工作的不深入，并且使他常常重新思考，思考那些已写就的和已出版的著作，他认为没有十足完善、十全十美而不需再用批评的眼光来修改的东西。夸美纽斯具有不断寻求更彻底、更完善的创造性的思想方法，这已是近代思想家的思想方法。
    夸美纽斯的对工作负责的自我批评精神也是他人格的特征之一。当他准备着出版“教育论著”全集时（1657—1658年出版于阿姆斯特丹，我们正在纪念其出版三百周年），他进行了严格的自我批评与修改。他认为改正会贻害别人的错误是任何忠实的人的天责。因为他要在自己的著作里去莠存谷，去伪存真，他在“智慧之芽”书中应用了农民在去除谷粒里的莠草子时用的扇风车的图。夸美纽斯犹如接受了我们的辩证认识论一样，认为认识真理是必须经过错误和克服错误的过程，所以他是反对权威主义和教条主义的。
    夸美纽斯爱人，尤其是爱自己的捷克人民，所以他非常关心他们的教育，他看到教育是民族生存的重要方法之一。他着重指出，受教育不应该仅限于民族中少数懂拉丁文的人。他在西欧经济比较发达的国家里看到用本国语言来教育能使广大的市民阶层和手工业者也获得受教育的机会，而在捷克却缺乏这个条件，所以，他的第一本用捷文写的教育学的著作，首先是致力于发展捷克教育的。
    作为夸美纽斯高贵品质之一的对祖国语言的敬爱不仅表现在他自己用本国语言写作并号召捷克的知识分子用捷克语言写作，而且在于作为发展民族教育的奠基人之一，他能看到民族的语言应当作为教育用语这一点。为此，他开始收集字汇，编写字典“捷克语宝库”的工作，以显示捷克语词汇的丰富。夸美纽斯对捷克人民，对捷克语言的爱是和对国土的爱交织在一起的。
    他在1649年得知瑞典首相奥克逊斯岩恩因为他的不断提请注意瑞典对捷克民族所负的责任而感到受侮辱时，他给首相写了一封信，表示民族的苦难就是他自己的苦难，他写道：“那次我向你述说的苦难，并不是我私人的苦难，而是公众的苦难。遭到遗弃的并不是我或者和我有共同信仰的同伴们，而是整个的民族。”夸美纽斯还坚信历史定能做出正义的结论。当他看到某些人背弃了捷克民族时，他仍坚信这些人终究能认识到，以别的民族的被奴役作为代价是换不来本民族的自由的，假若别的民族遭到奴役和压迫，本民族决不会由此得到好处。从这里可看出夸美纽斯为本国人民服务的思想已发展成为为人类服务的思想，夸美纽斯的爱国主义已发展成为改革整个社会，要求实现更人道、更正义的制度，和要求全面的改革的努力。他想用实行全面的教育来达到全面的改革，其结果便将给世界带来持久的和平。
    现在我想说一说夸美纽斯改革社会的思想。他认识了正在崩溃的封建社会的危机和腐朽后，才产生他改革社会的思想。他对那时社会的压迫不能表示同意，他改革社会思想的发展过程是反映在他的著作里，从“寄天国书”，经“迷宫”，“光明之路”，直到“民族的幸福”和“全面改革”。
    无可否认，在夸美纽斯初期的思想里，对社会问题的看法表现出明显的矛盾和动摇。一方面，我们不能片面地认为他的思想毫无保留地、全都是进步的，但另一方面，我们也不能机械地来对待他思想里的矛盾，认为这种矛盾在夸美纽斯的全部著作和行动里总是一成不变的，好像他的思想矛盾是一个永远的标记，这样的看法会导致机械地来了解夸美纽斯，简单、粗暴地来对待夸美纽斯对社会问题的观点。对他思想里的矛盾也不能只作概念化的解释，说这是他生活的时代转折点在他思想里的反映，因为这样概念的解释，会使我们忽略了在夸美纽斯内心进行的新与旧的激烈斗争。这斗争使他认识了封建社会崩溃的更真实的原因，那就是经济生活发生了变化，在崩溃着的封建制度里已生长了资本主义的关系。夸美纽斯在国外的流亡生活里就亲自看到了这种关系。用马克思主义的发展的历史观点来分析当时欧洲的政治事件，我们就能更清楚地明白，夸美纽斯如何在他的初期，在大多数场合都是以封建秩序的代言人，甚至是卫道者的身份出现，但愈到后来，他就愈坚定地变成了正在崩溃着的封建制度的战斗的批评家，变成了民主思想的宣传人和保卫者了。
    当年轻的夸美纽斯还在富涅克（捷克地名）做牧师时就开始考虑社会问题，这在1619年在奥洛摩茨（捷克摩拉维亚地区的中心城市）出版的“寄天国书”里可以找到论证。在这些书信里，夸美纽斯还是表现为封建的贵族等级秩序的维护人，虽然在某些地方已出现了对封建社会内部秩序的缺点和矛盾的指责。书中也缺乏民主精神，没有任何想超出宗教范围来解决社会不平等的企图，我们在书中也找不到承继胡斯运动的里塔波尔派激进的革命精神的传统。
    夸美纽斯在“世界迷宫”中的社会见解还同样地受着如我们在“寄天国书”中所见的那种封建观念的束缚，虽则他正确地愈来愈紧张地看到末日将临的封建制度正在崩溃的种种迹象。他着重地指出政权机关的混乱与缺点，立法制度与法律尊严的缺陷，以及教士堕落到专事搜括钱财的耻辱，……“把那些人称作神父乃是错误，现在应该叫‘钱父’”。夸美纽斯以讽刺的口吻把一些专门搜括钱财的、身为主持法律与公道的执法人用“吹牛大王、米蛀虫、坏蛋、讼棍……”等名词来刻划他们的形象。夸美纽斯不断地在“世界迷宫”中，在福音书与宗教的谦和中，在作为所有现时代的世俗的巴比伦的一个好基督徒应有的与世无争的态度中看到了改革当时社会制度的最好的道路，对夸美纽斯来说这是一条从“世界迷宫”走向“心的乐园”的唯一可能的道路。
    但夸美纽斯在“迷宫”的另一个地方所看到的仍是值得注意：他也觉得世俗的不公道与贫富悬殊的暂时性的那种自欺欺人的说法是永远不能使穷人完全满足的，因为在这个世界上，穷人所身受的不平等与不公道实在太沉重了。于是我们在这里（第三十二章）碰上了夸美纽斯的带有维新主义色彩的思想；他说在这个世界上的社会制度并不排斥任何穷人。他写道：“每个人不要失去机会，走任何一条道路将自己从穷困中拯救出来。”
    即使在“世界迷宫”中的战斗性与民主性仅是一些孤立的因素，我仍把这种因素理解为夸美纽斯对社会的见解进一步发展的先期认识，这一点可以在他以后的作品中，如“光明之路”、“民族的幸福”、“和平天使”以及最出色的“全面改革”中获得证实。
    我认为，“光明之路”（1641—42）是夸美纽斯的社会见解发展的另一个阶段，这本书写于夸美纽斯居留在英国期间，1668年方始出版；其中可看到他对建立世界科学院以及编制世界语言的引人注意的建议。“目睹社会的矛盾就导致对社会纷争的诊断，社会的全体不腐烂，你就徒然再从已经改正的部分去改进什么……”（第三十二页）夸美纽斯那时不仅看到封建制度表现在阶级矛盾的尖锐上不合理的结果；他更深一层进行了分析，寻找社会不见起色的原由，并且他在不良的政治基础上，可以这么说，在借以建立封建制度的不良政治学说上发现了这个原由。夸美纽斯写道：我必须直言无讳，为现时统治阶级所支持的主要的政治学说，仅是障眼的手法，是社会动荡不宁的真正原因。对原因的认识就把夸美纽斯引向寻求改革的途径。他说：“……不正确的，根深蒂固的习惯势力的约束得非常严紧，非有大勇不能破除。”这是可靠的文件之一，证明在“迷宫”中还以不摒绝邪恶作为解救原则的夸美纽斯已经从宗教的和平主义的消极中解放出来了。
    值得注意的是夸美纽斯在这时期并不期待教会的代表人物或理论家来改革社会，他认为社会改革是世界权力的持有者，“政治的执掌者”之任务。（“光明之路”序第二十七节）
    夸美纽斯在“民族的幸福”这部著作中首先面临为全体人民所有，非统治者所独享的那种“普及自由”的民主要求。与“普及自由”相关的还有更进一步的民主要求，即要求法律必须是全体人民的，法律，符合全体人民的利益。他要求国家的政权应该有农民与市民的参加，这里夸美纽斯似乎已经越过了中世纪君主政体的结构范围，君主政体的观念在“全面改革”一书中已完全克服，他不将社会的阶层以封建社会贵贱来区分，而是按职业来区分。
    在“民族的幸福”中夸美纽斯对劳动作为全体人民不分贵贱的当然义务的这个见解就带有鲜明的民主主义色彩。他认为模范的社会应该没有失业的痛苦，每个人必须劳动，权力只强加于不肯劳动的人。他把劳动理解为义务，理解为医治懒惰的万用灵药，不过这里他错误地将懒惰当作国家混乱的源由。
    1667年（夸美纽斯在1656—1670居留在阿姆斯特丹）他写了“和平天使”，这本书涉及英国与尼德兰的使者在勃兰达议和的事件。在阿姆斯特丹他有机会看到商业资本的蓬勃发展，但这没有使他眼花撩乱，相反地他揭开了财富集中的阴影。他猛烈地反对企业主的剥削，并以惩罚来警告他们。作为一个理想主义者，他看到了这样的社会制度：
  “在这个社会里人人做工，人人享受自己劳动的成果。”
      “全面改革”是夸美纽斯登峰造极的综合性作品“人类事务全面改革总建议”中之最重要的（第五）部分，它意味着夸美纽斯的研究社会的见解进一步的发展。夸美纽斯自己并没有把“全面改革”的全部出版，首先是据友好的预测必然会引起当时社会上保守集团的反对与攻击的，那几章没有出版，因为那几章涉及保障世界和平，改革教会，改革国体等事件。
      “全面改革”这部著作，据我看来——如我所试图指出的——可列为夸美纽斯最精辟的社会见解，这些见解在夸美纽斯以前的几部著作中已有所准备和酝酿。夸美纽斯的社会见解与前期的相比较，所不同者是后期的见解更为具体，更明确而坚决。
    “全面改革”中我们也可以找到夸美纽斯早期民主思想的成分，这在后期的令人信服的论文中更鲜明的表现出来。
    如在“大教学论”中所提出的“人人受文化”的正当要求，在“全面改革”中再一次获得强调：全部青年应毫无例外的接受正规教育，“即使是最穷苦人家的孩子也不应该当作朽木而不加雕琢……”。
    民主思想还表现在要求调整公民关系与社会管理制度的建议中。夸美纽斯提出了“区域制”的思想，这就是说每个县分的每个地区都派出自己的代表，每月定期聚会，商议并解决一些共同有关的事宜。如问题涉及全州可以在首府的市代表会上解决。至于文化与教育之间的关系，教会事务，公民生活与经济问题都可以由报纸来担承，用他的话来说，报纸应该是“传播文化与智慧的工具”。
    他的建议中还包括为公众服务的民主要求：当局应该关怀公共建筑物的建设，学校近旁还应该有医院、孤儿院、贫民收容所、养老院等。当局也应该设法让穷人的子弟上学成为切实可行的事；我们可以认为“大教学论”中的“人人受文化”要求也就是在理论原则上的经济考虑。
    我想，以上所引述的有关夸美纽斯民主思想的文件足以说明夸美纽斯不仅在自己的思想发展过程中没有脱离过进步的路线，并且在他的杰作“全面改革”中彻底而具体地补充并发展了他的改革世界秩序的思想。夸美纽斯克服了在他的早期作品如“寄天国书”和“世界迷宫”的一部分中牢固的宗教消极性，有的甚至在“民族的幸福”中也已经明显地克服了。在“全面改革”中夸美纽斯显得更坚决更不妥协。
    在“和平天使”这部著作中，他的社会改革的思想是与保持世界和平的思想结合在一起的，我们在其中可以看到对见利忘义自私贪婪的批判。夸美纽斯在寻找一切当时社会的混乱，主要是战争的根源的过程中认识到战争与社会混乱的主要原因在于争夺权力，争夺市场与利益。当他看到一切战争的背面恰是那种下流的贪婪的动机时，就不禁提出愤怒的抗议。
    当然，夸美纽斯能够区别什么是掠夺的战争，什么是正义的战争；在正义的战争中武器不是狂暴的工具，而是正义的工具，正义的战争不是为了争霸夺权，而是捍卫正义。这个见解有夸美纽斯在1658年2月致荷兰船长致敬信可以作证（这封信是附在“教育论著全集”中的）。
    这个见解是夸美纽斯在“全面改革”与“和平天使”产生时期的思想本源的自然结论。夸美纽斯不仅没有束手无策，相反是英勇地发挥了他的和平与全面改革的思想。他为和平与全面改革所作的努力，目的在于争取一个没有弱肉强食的野兽，没有嫁战祸于人的恶魔，没有损人利己胡作非为的歹徒”的社会。夸美纽斯尽管在当时混乱的社会中自身备尝亡命国外颠沛流离之苦，尽管他回国之后大失所望，但他仍然坚信持久和平的可能，仍然为了自己的乐观信仰诲人不倦，他对人类的无比热爱，对人类以及人类的进步与发展的伟大信仰足以令人敬崇。
