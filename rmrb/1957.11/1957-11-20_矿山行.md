    Mine Trip
  　Li Jia
    The mine, the mine, is like a benevolent God of Wealth, sitting leisurely on a vast green velvet carpet, rubbing his sleepy eyes to greet the morning sun, warmly waving and saying hello to us. Good morning, people, good morning! I know you will come with the morning sun. What are you anxiously searching for? Why not sit down and pour out your heart to me? Good morning, people, good morning! Rest a while, I already know what's on your mind; aren't you searching for the treasure of happiness? Take it, take it! I have already prepared it for you! The mine is like a benevolent God of Wealth, his face full of smiles, warmer than the morning sun; he gently strokes our foreheads and generously takes out countless glittering jewels.
    The Mine Shaft
    When I put on my work clothes and go down into the mine shaft, I feel like I am once again on the front lines of a raging war! It seems I once fought tunnel warfare against the enemy here, it seems I was once bathed in the thick smoke of gunpowder here. However, there is no bloody stench here, no sky-filled flames and smoke, what shines here is not the flash of knives and swords, what is heard here is not the screams of hatred and killing. The hoisting bucket rapidly descends again and again, as if to send people all the way to the heart of the earth; lights flash past, layer after layer, as if walking down an ancient building buried deep underground. Electric lights illuminate the tunnels like brightly lit streets, and large ventilation ducts bring gusts of spring breeze to the tunnels; the spring breeze, accompanied by the workers' loud chants, awakens the mineral deposits that have been sleeping for millions of years. Here, there is the fragrance of gems everywhere, here, you can see hearts blooming everywhere, what shines here are the pneumatic drills and the people's eyes, what is heard here is heroic and magnificent singing. When I put on my work clothes and go down into the mine shaft, I feel like I am once again on the front lines of a raging war; but what is taking place here is not a bloody battle, it is our march towards the hell that imprisons the mineral deposits!

    矿山行
  　黎家
    矿山矿山像一位慈祥的财神爷，安闲地盘坐在阔大的绿绒毯上，迎着朝阳揉搓着惺忪的睡眼，热情地向我们招手问好。早啊，人们，早上好！我知道你们会随着朝阳来到。你们焦急地在探寻什么呀？为什么不坐下来把心事向我倾诉？早啊，人们，早上好！歇一歇吧，你们的心事我早猜到；你们莫不是探寻幸福的财宝？拿吧，拿吧！我早已为你们准备好！矿山像一位慈祥的财神爷，满脸微笑，比朝阳还温厚；他轻轻地抚摸着我们的前额，又慷慨地掏出无数闪光的珠宝。
    矿坑当我换上工装下到矿坑的时候，我好像又置身在烽火连天的前线！我好像曾经在这里与敌人进行过坑道战，我好像曾经在这里沐浴过浓烈的硝烟。可是，这里闻不到血腥的臭味，这里没有漫天的火焰和硝烟，这里闪亮的不是刀光和剑影，这里听到的不是仇恨和撕杀的尖叫。升降斗疾速地下降又下降，好像要把人们一直送到大地的心脏；眼前闪过一层又一层灯光，又像是走下深埋地底的古老楼房。电灯把坑道照耀像通亮的街道，合抱的风筒给坑道送来阵阵春风；春风伴合着工人们嘹亮的号子，唤醒了沉睡千万年的矿藏。这里，到处是宝石的芬芳，这里，到处可见心花在怒放，这里闪亮的是风钻和人们的目光，这里听到的是豪迈宏壮的歌声。当我换上工装下到矿坑的时候，我好像又置身在烽火连天的前线；可是这里进行的不是血腥的激战，是我们向囚禁矿藏的地狱进军！
