What is Lacking in Creative Work?

At first, I didn't realize it. I felt that in recent years I hadn't completely detached myself from life. I would always take a few months each year to go to the countryside, and my connection with the masses hadn't been severed. But in reality, the connection with the masses *was* broken. If there was any connection, it was just a tenuous link. Relying on just a few thin threads isn't enough to connect. Even if I spent more time living in the countryside each year, it wouldn't solve the fundamental problem, because my attitude towards life was completely different from before. Before coming to Beijing, I was an amateur writer, I had my own job, and I shouldered certain responsibilities. Marching and fighting meant marching and fighting; participating in land reform meant participating in land reform. I was just a drop of water in a rapid current, the same as all the other water droplets. My emotions were consistent with those of the broad masses. When there was a drought, the peasants were very anxious, and I was just as anxious; when there was a good harvest, everyone was very happy, and I was just as happy. If work was done well, I was praised; if work was done badly, I was criticized, and there was no difference between me and other cadres. There was no such thing as "experiencing life," because I was already immersed in "life." But now it's different. Going to the countryside is just to "experience" other people's lives. Others finish their work, and I go to take a look. It's like watching a wedding or a funeral, just standing on the sidelines and observing other people's joy or sorrow, without feeling the same real emotions myself. If I'm interested, I'll watch for a while; if I'm not interested, I'll watch for a shorter time. If it suits me, I'll stay; if it doesn't suit me, I'll leave. Anyway, it's someone else's business, and it doesn't have much to do with me.

What exactly is lacking in some of the works I've written in recent years? I think what's mainly lacking is a full, genuine emotion; a strong sense of life. This kind of way of "experiencing life" and this kind of attitude towards life will inevitably produce this kind of result. If this isn't thoroughly changed, these fatal flaws in my works will never be remedied. If I continue to "drift along" like this, the result will be unimaginable. After a long period of distress, I understood this point, so I left Beijing last spring. Although I haven't really gone deep yet, I have this determination: to go to the fiery struggle, to participate in practical work. Even if I can't write any works, I can do something beneficial for the masses. That's much better than writing some insipid articles.

    在创作里缺少了什么？
    起先我并没有意识到这一点，我觉得这几年自己并没有完全脱离生活，差不多每年总要抽几个月时间到乡下去，和群众的联系并没有割断。实际上和群众的联系是断了。如果说还有点联系的话，也只不过是一种藕断丝连罢了。单靠几条细丝是连接不到一起的。即使每年抽更多的时间下去生活，也不能解决根本问题，因为对待生活的态度和以前完全不相同了。我在到北京之前，是一个业余作者，我有我自己的工作岗位，担负着一定的任务。行军打仗就是行军打仗；参加土地改革就是参加土地改革。我只是激流中的一滴水，和其余的水滴一样。和广大群众的情感是相一致的，天旱了，农民们很焦急，我也一样焦急；丰收了，大家很高兴，我也一样高兴。工作做好了受表扬，工作做坏了受批评，和别的干部并没有什么两样。也没有“体验生活”这一说，因为自己本来就是置身于“生活”之中的。而现在却不同了，下乡去只是“体验体验”别人的生活。别人把事情办完了，自己去看一看。就像去看娶媳妇、埋死人一样，只是站到旁边观察别人的欢乐或悲哀，自己并没有产生同样的真实的情感。有兴趣就多看一阵，没兴趣就少看一阵。合则来，不合则去。反正是别人家的事情，与自己关系不大。
    我这近年来所写的一些作品中，究竟缺少点什么呢？我觉得主要是缺少一种饱满的真实的情感；缺少一种浓厚的生活气息。这样一种“体验生活”的方式，和这样一种对待生活的态度，必然要产生这样一种结果。如不加以彻底改变，作品中的这些致命的缺陷是永远无法弥补的。再这样“混”下去，其结果将是不堪设想的。经过很长时间的苦恼，我明白了这一点，于是在去年春天离开了北京。现在虽然还没有真正深入下去，但我有这样的决心，决心到火热的斗争中去，参加实际工作。即使写不出什么作品来，也可做点对群众有益的事情。比写一些不痛不痒的文章要好的多。　（摘自文艺学习1957、11期马烽：“一点体会”）
