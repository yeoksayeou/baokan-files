For the New Generation
    -- Reflections on the Soviet Feature Film "A Calling"
    He Yi
    Amidst the burning ruins of Stalingrad, beside his mother lying in a pool of blood, young Alyosha's terrified and desperate cries are a sorrowful accusation against the heinous war of aggression, directed at all honest and conscientious people!
    How many orphans did the sinful war create! These unfortunate young lives, whether in imperialist countries or in colonies or dependencies, could only be abandoned in ditches, or roam the streets, becoming repulsive social dregs, becoming candidates for thieves, swindlers, hooligans, and prostitutes. But Alyosha, although he unfortunately lost his parents, was fortunate enough to grow up on the land of the Soviet state. The motherland nurtured him, cared for him meticulously, and cultivated him, enabling him to grow into a healthy and well-educated good young man. Dobrynin, the Honored Artist of the State who spent a wandering childhood on the banks of the Volga in the old days, and was later educated and became a musician under the Soviet regime, is precisely an example ahead of him.
    In the Soviet Union, in all socialist countries, the entire society takes over the responsibility of raising and caring for children from their deceased parents. Orphans are not "helpless and without appeal." Alyosha's life in the orphanage illustrates this point.
    Under the loving care and education of Mama Masha (the director Maria who rescued Alyosha from the artillery fire) and the teachers, the orphans live in a warm family and do not feel the pain of losing their parents' love at all. When Dobrynin suggested taking Alyosha to Moscow to study at a music school, Maria said with both joy and worry: "This matter is too sudden! No, Comrade Dobrynin, I can't decide like this, I have to think about it." These few words not only demonstrate the spirit of a highly responsible orphanage director for the children's future, but also, what a loving mother's voice! Later, when Alyosha went to Moscow, his close relationship with the orphanage director and his classmates was not diluted in the slightest. People cared about Alyosha, and Alyosha cared about the orphanage. When Alyosha gave his first formal performance, Maria personally rushed to Moscow to attend the concert, shedding tears of joy for the achievements of the child she had raised. Maria is precisely a typical example of all Soviet women who love children, regard all children as their own flesh and blood, and possess a high degree of socialist consciousness and responsibility.
    Not only in the orphanage, but on the land of the Soviet state, even if you go to the ends of the earth, orphans receive warmth and care just like other children. Alyosha in unfamiliar Moscow also received the care of teachers and classmates. Although there are people like Dobrynin's wife, Irina, who have selfish intentions and mistakenly believe that all the children in the orphanage are uneducated wild children, and are afraid that keeping Alyosha at home will corrupt their own son. But she was immediately given a gentle lesson by her husband. When her son Polya insulted Alyosha at the music school, Alyosha, who had a high degree of self-respect, no longer returned to Polya's home. The door of every family in Moscow is open to orphans. And Polya was also condemned by his classmates, teachers, and father, and recognized that this kind of thinking and behavior was wrong and shameful.
    Soviet children are the happiest in the world. All children, including orphans, receive the best care and cultivation from the state and society. But in the work of cultivating and raising children, there are two different methods. One is the method of Dobrynin and Professor Nikolsky, who not only try their best to prepare the best learning conditions for the children and constantly guide them patiently, but also pay more attention to the cultivation of moral character. They want to teach the children to become, as Dobrynin said, "honest and upright people" first. This is the correct method. But there is another method, which is Irina's method. She believes that Polya is a genius and needs "special care." Besides playing the piano, she doesn't let Polya do anything. Even tidying the bedroom and schoolbag has to be done for him, for fear of "damaging" the child's fingers; she won't let her son go to school when it's cold, and when her son gets a score of two, she argues "rationally" with the teacher... Gradually, Polya becomes a lazy, selfish, arrogant and willful child. This is the wrong educational method. This educational method runs counter to the purpose of socialist education. It cannot cultivate a new generation of socialists with a high degree of culture and moral cultivation, but can only cultivate the child (regardless of whether he is a genius or not) into a new type of "young master" who "loves and respects no one but himself" (Dobrynin's words criticizing Polya). The film "A Calling," while positively praising the correct educational method, kindly criticizes Irina's mistakes.
    With the encouragement and help of Mama Masha and Dobrynin, and under the patient guidance of Professor Nikolsky, Alyosha, who has musical talent, finally achieved excellent results through his hard work and showed his talent at the concert. The film completely convinces people that Alyosha will definitely become a valuable person in the future. Similarly, Polya will also be able to correct his mistakes and have ample opportunity to develop his talent. Because, the children are living in the Soviet Union today! Socialism not only guarantees the happy and healthy growth of children in material life, but also provides a social foundation for the growth of tremendous moral strength and the full development of talent. This is also one of the clear proofs that the socialist system is superior to the decadent capitalist social system.
    Protect children! Always care for children, correctly love and teach children, and prepare the best conditions for the development prospects of children! This is already the duty that all Soviet citizens should fulfill to the socialist motherland! Similarly, this should also be the duty that we Chinese people, who are building socialism, should fulfill to the motherland!

    为了新一代
    ——苏联故事片“天职”观后感
    贺宜
    在燃烧的斯大林格勒的废墟上，在倒卧在血泊中的母亲身畔，幼小的阿略沙的惊恐绝望的啼哭声，是向一切正直的有良心的人们，对罪恶的侵略战争提出的悲愤控诉！
    罪恶的战争制造了多少的孤儿啊！这些不幸的小生命，无论在帝国主义国家或是殖民地或附属国里，只能委转沟壑，或者流落街头，成为惹人憎恶的社会的赘疣，成为盗贼、骗子、流氓、妓女的候补者。但是，阿略沙虽然不幸失去了父母，却幸而是生长在苏维埃国家的土地上。祖国抚育了他，无微不至地关怀他，培养他，使他成长为健壮的有教养的好少年。同样是孤儿，旧时代在伏尔加河畔度过流浪的童年生活，而后来在苏维埃政权下被教养成为音乐家的国家功勋艺术家多布雷宁，正是走在他前面的榜样。
    在苏联，在一切社会主义国家里，全社会把抚养爱护子女的责任从死去的父母手里接了过来。孤儿是并不“孤苦无告”的。阿略沙在孤儿院中的生活说明了这一点。
    孤儿们在玛沙妈妈（就是把阿略沙从炮火中抢救出来的院长玛丽亚）和教师们的爱抚教育下，生活在一个温暖的大家庭中，丝毫也不感到因失去父母之爱的痛苦。当多布雷宁建议带阿略沙到莫斯科进音乐学校去培养的时候，玛丽亚又喜又愁地说：“这件事太突然了！不，多布雷宁同志，我还不能这样就决定，我得想一想。”寥寥数语，不仅表现了作为孤儿院院长的对孩子前途高度负责的精神，而且，这又是何等慈爱的母亲的声音！后来阿略沙到了莫斯科，他和孤儿院院长和同学们亲如骨肉的关系也丝毫没有冲淡。人们惦记着阿略沙，阿略沙惦记着孤儿院。当阿略沙作第一次正式演奏的时候，玛丽亚还亲自赶到莫斯科来出席音乐会，为自己抚养长大的孩子的成就而高兴得流泪。玛丽亚正是一切热爱儿童，把所有的孩子都视同骨肉的具有高度社会主义觉悟和责任心的苏联妇女的典型。
    不仅在孤儿院里，在苏维埃国家的土地上，那怕走到天南地北，孤儿也和别的孩子一样得到温暖和爱护。阿略沙在陌生的莫斯科，也受到教师和同学们的关怀，虽然还有像多布雷宁的妻子伊丽娜那样的人，存在着自私的打算，并且错误地认为孤儿院里的全是些没教养的野孩子，害怕把阿略沙留在家里会带坏自己的儿子。但是她立刻受到丈夫温婉的教训。她的儿子波里亚在音乐学校中侮辱了阿略沙的时候，对自己的人格高度自尊的阿略沙不再回到波里亚家中。莫斯科的每一个家庭的门都对孤儿开着的。而波里亚也受到同学、教师和父亲的谴责，并且认识了这种思想和行为是错误的、可耻的。
    苏联的儿童是世界上最幸福的。一切孩子，包括孤儿，都得到国家和社会最好的关怀和培养。但是在培养和儿童的工作上，存在着两种不同的方法。一种是多布雷宁和尼阔里斯基教授的方法，他们不仅尽力为孩子们准备最好的学习条件，不断循循善诱，而且更注意到道德品质的培养。他们要把孩子们首先教养成多布雷宁所说的“诚实而正直的人”。这是正确的方法。但是另外还有一种方法，那是伊丽娜的方法。她认为波里亚是个天才，需要“特殊照顾”，除了弹钢琴，不让波里亚干什么事，连整理卧室和书包也要为他代劳，怕“弄坏”了孩子的手指头；天冷就不让儿子上学，儿子得了两分，就向老师据“理”力争；……慢慢地波里亚就成为一个懒惰、自私、而又骄傲任性的孩子。这是错误的教育方法。这种教育方法是跟社会主义教育的目的背道而驰的，它不能培养出有高度文化和道德教养的社会主义新一代，只能把孩子（不管他是不是天才）培养成一种“除了自己谁也不爱，谁也不尊重”（多布雷宁批评波里亚的话）的新式“小少爷”。影片“天职”在正面赞扬了那种正确的教育方法的同时，善意地批判了伊丽娜的错误。
    具有音乐天才的阿略沙在玛沙妈妈和多布雷宁的鼓励和帮助之下，在尼阔里斯基教授的循循善诱之下，加上自己的刻苦努力，终于取得了优秀的成绩，在音乐会上初露头角，影片完全使人相信：阿略沙以后肯定会成为一个有价值的人。同样的，波里亚也一定能改正他的错误，并且有充分发展他的天才的机会。因为，孩子们是生活在今天的苏联！社会主义不仅在物质生活上保证了孩子们幸福健康的生长，而且也提供了滋长巨大道德力量和充分发展天才的社会基础。这也正是社会主义制度比腐朽的资本主义社会制度优越的明证之一。
    保卫孩子！时刻关心孩子，正确地爱护和教导孩子，为孩子们的发展前途准备最好的条件！这已经是全体苏联公民对社会主义祖国应尽的天职！同样的，这也应该是我们建设着社会主义的中国人民对祖国应尽的天职！
