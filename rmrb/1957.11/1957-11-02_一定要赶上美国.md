    Must Catch Up With the United States
    By Our Correspondent Li He
    "Catch up with and surpass the United States in per capita output!" The Communist Party of the Soviet Union has issued such a call to the people. This is the basic economic task of the Soviet Union.

    "Must catch up with and surpass the United States!" The Soviet people have responded to the Party's call. Workers, collective farmers, and scientific workers are all filled with the firm determination to defeat capitalist countries in peaceful economic competition.

    The Soviet Union has gone through two wars and has only been able to carry out peaceful construction for a little more than thirty years, and the economic foundation left over from before the revolution was weak and poor. Nevertheless, in just forty years, the Soviet Union has caught up with and surpassed the United States, which has more than a hundred years of capitalist development history and made a fortune in the two world wars, in terms of absolute industrial growth rate, the latest scientific achievements, and so on.

    Despite this, when the Communist Party of the Soviet Union called on agricultural workers this May to catch up with the United States in per capita production of meat, milk, and fats in the next few years, American bourgeois elements laughed again. In their view, that was absolutely impossible. These people fail to see the large-scale increase in livestock products brought about by the further development of agriculture in the Soviet Union in recent years, and they do not know how great the potential power of Soviet agriculture is after its drastic improvement in recent years.

    There are fewer skeptics that the Soviet Union's per capita milk production will catch up with the United States relatively quickly. The average annual milk production per cow in Soviet collective farms increased by more than half from 1953 to 1956, reaching more than 1,600 kilograms. On a per capita basis, the milk production in Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania has already exceeded that of the United States last year. Calculated on the basis of every 100 hectares of agricultural land, not only these three republics, but also Ukraine, Belarus, and sixteen states of the Russian Federal Republic, achieved high yields of 200, 300, and 400 quintals of milk last year. In the first eight months of this year, the milk production of collective farms and state farms throughout the Soviet Union increased by 3.2 million tons compared with the same period last year, an increase of 21%. Therefore, it will not take long to increase milk production from 49.1 million tons in 1956 to 70 million tons—catching up with the United States on a per capita basis.

    Increasing meat production is a more difficult task. However, there is also a sufficient material basis for proposing this task. From 1953 to 1956, meat production increased by 1.3 million tons (gross weight), while in the past three years the Soviet Union's main attention was still focused on increasing grain production. Therefore, this is not the real speed of meat production increase in the Soviet Union. If people see the high morale of Soviet agricultural workers today in responding to the Party's call and their determination to compete with the United States in peaceful economic competition, they will understand that their strength cannot be measured by ordinary statistical standards. I recently witnessed this exciting sentiment in Moldova.

    I arrived in Moldova during the grape harvest season. The collective farm members told me with smiles: This year is a bumper grape harvest! In this land of grapes, a bumper grape harvest is a great joy. Moldova's vineyards and orchards account for one-third of the total in the Soviet Union, and this year it will harvest about 270,000 tons of grapes. What could attract the hearts of the people of Moldova more than a bumper grape harvest? Yes, that is increasing meat production.

    No matter which district, people are thinking and talking about increasing meat production and raising pigs, because raising pigs is an effective way to rapidly increase meat production. The rural areas of the entire republic have been involved in this patriotic movement. Many collective farms guarantee to produce 60 to 100 quintals of meat and 300 to 350 quintals of milk per 100 hectares of agricultural land this year. In the first half of this year, the collective farms sold twice as much meat to the state as in the first half of last year.

    The southern Chadyr-Lunga District is at the forefront of the meat production increase movement. This is a thriving district. There are thirteen collective farms in the district. As of August 20, the district produced 45 quintals of meat per 100 hectares, which is equal to one and a half times the total for last year; among them, the Kirov Collective Farm produced 100 quintals, and the Ilyich's Testament Collective Farm produced 83 quintals. People are highly motivated, and they are confident that they can fulfill their promise of producing 60 quintals of meat per 100 hectares of agricultural land throughout the district, and the output will increase greatly in the next year and the year after.

    This belief is not simply based on enthusiasm. Volnyansky, the first secretary of the district committee, took me to visit several collective farms' pigsties and feed bases. Although it was a brief visit, it was clear that people's confidence was well-founded. The district is raising more than 60,000 piglets and more than 5,000 sows this year, almost all of which have been developed since 1955. The Ilyich's Testament Collective Farm is raising 2,200 pigs this year, almost twice as many as last year. The Kirov Collective Farm is actively expanding its feed and pigpens, preparing to leap to a peak of 180 quintals of meat per 100 hectares of agricultural land within three years. Raising pigs, raising more pigs, increasing meat production, that is the situation in the entire district.

    In this situation, the minds of people at all levels are focused on pig farming. Doing a good job in pig farming has become the primary task of the Party District Committee. Volnyansky personally checks the pigsties and feed everywhere, reminding each collective farm to mate the sows in time so that piglets can be added in January next year. Party members, members of the Communist Youth League, and outstanding villagers have been sent to work in pig farms. Field, orchard, and tractor work teams have also started raising pigs. They built temporary pigpens on open spaces with wooden fences, with each team raising 50 to 100 pigs. They are feeding discarded food and fodder planted using the corners of the fields. More attention has been paid to the preparation and cultivation of feed, and it is used more economically. The planting area of ​​corn, which is suitable for growing here, has increased. Supplementary feed has also been greatly developed. In order to utilize the abundant green fodder in the fields in summer and autumn, they arrange the farrowing time of sows between January, February, March, and July, August.

    The district plans to produce 100 quintals of meat per 100 hectares of agricultural land next year. To this end, all sows in the district will begin mating in September. They are expected to produce 44,000 piglets in the spring of next year, plus 20,000 left over from this autumn, for a total of 60,000. At the same time, each pig will be raised to more than 80 kilograms, in order to obtain 4,800 tons of pork. Together with the 3,000 cattle, 12,000 sheep, and 250,000 poultry sold next year, the goal of producing one quintal of meat per hectare will be achieved.

    Pointing to the pigsties full of fat pigs, Volnyansky talked about the development trend and said with confidence: "We must catch up with the United States."

    I had just returned to Moscow from Moldova when the agricultural workers in Chadyr-Lunga District reported to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union that they had achieved this year's goal ahead of schedule: collective farms throughout the district produced 63.9 quintals of meat per 100 hectares of agricultural land in nine months, which is equal to twice the total for last year and five times that of 1953.

    Agricultural workers all over the Soviet Union are involved in this "catch up with the United States" upsurge, welcoming the fortieth anniversary of the October Revolution with outstanding labor achievements. In the Kreizopol District of Vinnytsia Oblast, Ukrainian Republic, 88 quintals of meat and 241 quintals of milk were produced per 100 hectares of agricultural land in nine months. The Lenin Collective Farm in the Chuvash Autonomous Republic produced 102.6 quintals of meat and 239.3 quintals of milk per 100 hectares of agricultural land in nine months. The "Communist International" Collective Farm in Tambov Oblast produced 85 quintals of meat and 212 quintals of milk per 100 hectares of agricultural land in nine and a half months. … This is a good start. Soviet agricultural workers said: "What the Party says will be done!"

### 一定要赶上美国

    一定要赶上美国
    本报记者　李何
    “在按人口计算产量方面赶上和超过美国！”苏联共产党向人民提出这样的号召。这是苏联的基本经济任务。
    “一定要赶上和超过美国！”苏联人民响应了党的这一号召。工人、集体农民、科学工作者都怀着要在和平的经济竞赛中战胜资本主义国家的坚强斗志。
    苏联经过了两次战争，曾经只能用三十年多一点的时间进行和平建设，而且革命前留下的只是贫弱的经济基础。虽然如此，苏联在短短的四十年间，在工业的绝对增长率、科学的最新成就等等方面，还是赶上和超过有一百多年资本主义发展历史并且在两次世界大战中发过横财的美国。
    尽管这样，当今年5月苏联共产党号召农业劳动者在最近几年内在肉类、牛奶和油脂的生产上按人口平均计算赶上美国的时候，美国资产阶级分子又在讥笑了。在他们看来，那是绝对不可能的。这些人看不清几年来苏联进一步发展农业所造成的大规模提高畜产品的形势，他们不知道几年来苏联农业在狠狠地改进以后拥有何等巨大的潜在力量。
    苏联牛奶产量按人口平均计算将比较快地赶上美国，这方面的怀疑论者比较少。苏联集体农庄每头乳牛一年平均产奶量从1953年到1956年的三年中提高了半倍以上，达到一千六百多公斤。按人口平均计算，拉脱维亚、爱沙尼亚、立陶宛的牛奶产量在去年已经超过美国。按每一百公顷农业用地计算，不但这三个共和国，而且乌克兰、白俄罗斯两个共和国，以及俄罗斯联邦共和国的十六个州的牛奶产量在去年已经达到二、三、四百公担的高额。今年头八个月，全苏联集体农庄和国营农场的牛奶产量比去年同期增产了三百二十万吨，也就是增产了21％。所以，牛奶产量要从1956年的四千九百一十万吨提高到七千万吨——按人口平均计算赶上美国是不需要多久的。
    增产肉类的任务比较艰巨。但是，这个任务的提出，也有充分的物质基础。从1953年到1956年的三年中，肉类就增加了一百三十万吨（毛重），而过去三年苏联的主要注意力还是放在增产谷物方面。所以，这还不是苏联增产肉类的真正速度。人们如果看到苏联农业劳动者今天响应党的号召，决心在和平的经济竞赛中与美国较量的高涨情绪，那么就会了解，他们的力量不是普通统计学的尺度所能衡量的。最近我在摩尔达维亚见到了这种令人兴奋的情绪。
    我在收获葡萄的季节到了摩尔达维亚。集体农庄庄员们笑吟吟地告诉我：今年葡萄丰收！在这葡萄之乡，葡萄丰收是件莫大的喜事。摩尔达维亚葡萄园和果园的面积占全苏的三分之一，今年大约收获二十七万吨葡萄。有什么事情比葡萄丰收更吸引摩尔达维亚的人心呢？有，那就是增产肉类。
    不论在哪个区，人们想的和谈的都是关于肉类增产和养猪问题，因为养猪是迅速增产肉类的有效办法。整个共和国的农村都卷入这个爱国主义运动中去了。许多集体农庄保证今年每一百公顷农业用地生产肉类六十到一百公担，牛乳三百到三百五十公担。今年上半年集体农庄交售国家的肉类，比去年上半年增加了一倍。
    南部茶堆龙区走在增产肉类运动的前列。这是蓬勃发展的一个区。全区有十三个集体农庄。截至8月20日止，全区从每一百公顷生产了四十五公担肉类，这等于去年全年的一倍半；其中基洛夫集体农庄生产了一百公担，伊里奇遗训集体农庄生产了八十三公担。人们的劲头很大，他们自信能够实现全区每一百公顷农业用地生产六十公担肉类的诺言，而明年后年产量还要大大增加。
    这种信念不是单纯建立在一股热情上面的。区委第一书记沃尔良斯基带我参观了几个集体农庄的猪舍和饲料基地。虽然走马看花，但看得出人们的信心是有充分根据的。全区今年养六万多头仔猪和五千多头母猪，这几乎全是在1955年以后发展起来的。伊里奇遗训集体农庄今年养二千二百头猪，差不多为去年的两倍。基洛夫集体农庄积极地扩充饲料和猪圈，准备三年内跃进到每一百公顷农业用地生产一百八十公担肉类的高峰。养猪，多多养猪，增产肉类，这就是全区的形势。
    在这种形势下，上下的心都放在养猪业上了。把猪养好，已成为党区委会的首要任务。沃尔良斯基到处亲自检查猪圈和饲料，提醒各个集体农庄及时使母猪交配，使得明年1月就添加猪仔。党员、团员、优秀的庄员被派到养猪场工作了。田间、果园和拖拉机工作队也附带养起猪来。他们用木栅在空地上搭起临时的猪圈，每队养五十头到一百头。喂的是废弃的食物，以及利用田边地角栽种的饲料。饲料的准备和栽培已更加受注意，用起来也更加节约了。适宜于此地生长的玉米播种面积增加了。补充饲料也大大发展了。为了利用夏秋田间充足的青绿饲料，他们把母猪产仔的时间安排在一二三月间和七八月间。
    这个区计划在明年从每一百公顷农业用地生产一百公担肉类。为此，全区母猪在9月开始交配。要它们在明春产仔猪四万四千头，连同今秋留下的两万头，总共六万头。同时将把每头养到八十公斤以上，以便取得四千八百吨猪肉。加上明年交售的三千头牛、一万二千只羊和二十五万只家禽，那么一公顷地生产一公担肉的目标将会达到。
    沃尔良斯基指着满圈满栏的肥猪，谈着发展的趋势，信心十足地说：“一定要赶上美国。”
    我才从摩尔达维亚回到莫斯科，茶堆龙区农业劳动者已经向苏共中央报告他们提前实现了今年的目标：全区集体农庄在每一百公顷农业用地上在九个月中生产了六十三点九公担肉类，这等于去年全年的两倍，等于1953年的五倍。
    苏联全国各地农业劳动者都卷入了这个“赶上美国”的热潮中，以出色的劳动成就来迎接十月革命的四十周年。乌克兰共和国文尼查州克雷佐波尔区在九个月中在每一百公顷农业用地上生产了八十八公担的肉类和二百四十一公担的牛奶。楚瓦什自治共和国列宁集体农庄在九个月中在每一百公顷农业用地上生产了一百零二点六公担肉类和二百三十九点三公担牛奶。唐波夫州“共产国际”集体农庄在九个半月中在每一百公顷农业用地上生产了八十五公担肉类和二百一十二公担牛奶。……这是良好的开端。苏联农业劳动者说：“党说怎样，就会是怎样！”
