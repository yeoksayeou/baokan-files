Both Sides of the Hong River
—An Introduction to the Honghe Hani and Yi Autonomous Prefecture, Yunnan
By Our Correspondent Zhang Jiechun

Yunnan is a fascinating plateau, and the Honghe Hani and Yi Autonomous Prefecture in southern Yunnan is even more rich and colorful. It has a total population of more than 1.48 million people of various ethnic groups, including Han, Hani, Yi, Miao, Zhuang, Yao, Hui, Dai, Bai, Mongolian, Manchu, Tibetan, Kawa, Lisu, Lahu, and others.

The Honghe Hani and Yi Autonomous Prefecture is located on both sides of the famous Hong River (Red River), close to our friendly neighbor, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. It includes twelve counties—Honghe, Jinping, Yuanyang, Mengzi, Pingbian, Kaiyuan, Jianchui, Mile, Longwu, Quxi, Shiping, and Hekou—and the Liucun (Six Villages) administrative office, which is equivalent to a county. It was formed by the merger of the original Honghe Hani Autonomous Region and the Mengzi Special District. Mengzi is the location of the autonomous prefecture's government. On this fertile subtropical land of 32,500 square kilometers, the Hong River rushes with red waves through the evergreen Ailao Mountains. On both sides of the river are neat, terraced fields rising hundreds of levels to the high mountain peaks, forming a magnificent picture. In winter or spring, you can also enjoy the strange Hong River cloud sea in the morning. The mist churns in the river valley, and the peaks are faintly visible in the clouds and mist. At this time, you can't help but think of the Penglai fairyland, the descent of the Seven Fairies, and other myths. In summer, if you are interested, you can climb from the hot river valley up the cool mountain slopes to the misty summit of Guanyin Mountain, where you can admire the vast expanse of snow!

The Hong River basin is also a famous "land of fish and rice." A comrade told me that they had once used a grenade to bomb more than 200 catties of fish in the Tengtiao River (a tributary of the Hong River). The fish in the terraced fields are both fat and tender. The large yellow croaker in the Hong River weighs dozens of catties each. The dried fish from Yilong Lake in Shiping County have fine and thick meat, some even thicker than pork. The oily fish from Honghe County, with its tender meat and abundant oil, is a well-known specialty. There are also fish-quail as big as chicks, which are not only delicious but also have soft and crispy bones. If you are lucky, you can also spend twice as much money as pork to eat rare mountain delicacies such as bear paws and deer tendons. Tropical fruits such as bananas, coconuts, pineapples, jackfruit, mangoes, longans, papayas... are all produced here, and you can have whatever you like. There are also the Rusha pears from the banks of the Hong River, which are watery and delicate, the large and sweet Mengzi pomegranates from Mengzi County, and the sour pomegranates from Jianchui County, which leave a sweet taste in your mouth after eating, all of which are flavorful specialties.

This is also the main producing area of peanuts and sugarcane in Yunnan. Peanut production accounts for one-third of the province's total output, and sugarcane production accounts for one-quarter of the province's total output. Last year, the 3,091 mu of peanuts in the Shiliguan Agricultural Cooperative of Mengzi County yielded an average of 236 catties per mu, and the 4,703 mu of sugarcane in Quxi yielded an average of 10,335 catties per mu. This is also a good place to develop cotton. Last year, the 3,738 mu of cotton in Quxi yielded an average of 68 catties of ginned cotton per mu, with the highest reaching 125 catties. In the Second Five-Year Plan, cotton production here will increase from the current annual output of 5,648 dan to 75,000 dan. This is also an ideal place to develop rubber. This is also a treasure trove of medicinal materials. The valuable cao guo (black cardamom) can yield more than 500,000 catties annually, making it the highest-yielding area in the country. Cinnamon, notoginseng, deer antler, Bupleurum, Saposhnikovia divaricata, Aucklandia, betel nut, etc. are all produced here. There are also tropical crops such as kapok, lac, Bauhinia variegate, citronella, coffee, cocoa, lemon, lacquer, camphor, and oil tea.

There are also 900,000 hectares of forests, a large part of which are virgin forests with high economic value. The forests are home to rare birds and animals such as peacocks, gibbons, and slow lorises that sleep in trees all day long. Coal, iron, copper, mica, cinnabar, mercury, and rare metal deposits such as gold, aluminum, zinc, antimony, tungsten, manganese, and molybdenum are found in almost every county.

Hydropower resources are also extremely abundant. The 400-kilometer Hong River alone contains more energy than the current total hydropower capacity of the entire country.

However, in the past, this rich land did not bring happiness to the people. The mineral deposits were almost entirely untouched, the virgin forests were only useful for refuge, and most of the products were taken away by the Tusi, landlords, and reactionary governments. For the sake of their happy life, the people of all ethnic groups have waged heroic struggles. In the spring of 1948, the Axi people of Xishan and the Sani people of the Guishan area (both branches of the Yi ethnic group) first revolted against the oppression of the Kuomintang reactionary rulers. Subsequently, flames of resistance were ignited throughout the autonomous prefecture. Tens of thousands of people of ethnic minorities, together with the Han people, participated in the Yunnan underground armed forces led by the Communist Party. They blew ancient ox horns, lit torches, and took up hunting rifles and broadswords to fight the Kuomintang bandits in the deep mountains and forests. In 1949, they cooperated with the People's Liberation Army to annihilate the remnant bandits.

After liberation, under the brilliant light of the Party's ethnic policy and with the concerted efforts of the people of all ethnic groups, the people of the Honghe Hani and Yi Autonomous Prefecture have covered a distance in a short period of more than seven years that was unimaginable in the past hundreds of years. In terms of grain, the total output in 1956 increased by 40.9% compared with 1952, exceeding the First Five-Year Plan by 7.5% one year ahead of schedule, and transforming from a grain-deficient area to a surplus area. In terms of cash crops, comparing the output in 1956 with 1952, peanuts increased by 375.5%, sugarcane by 177.8%, and flue-cured tobacco by 474%. The total agricultural output value this year will increase by about 8% compared with last year. In terms of local industry, before liberation, there were only three small and dilapidated state-owned factories and mines and six private factories and mines. In 1956, there were 32 local state-owned and joint state-private factories and mines. This year, more than 60 new and expanded factories and mines have been built, with capital construction investment eleven times that of last year. The total output value this year is expected to reach more than 3.49 million yuan, seven times that of 1952, and 200.3% of the First Five-Year Plan. The total output value of handicrafts this year is expected to reach 13.33 million yuan, 364.5% of the pre-cooperative 1955. The transportation situation is also changing. After the completion of the Bihe Line at the end of the year, the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway will run through the north and south, and the Bishi Railway will run through the east and west, plus 14 newly built highways with a total length of 335 kilometers, and telephone and postal routes connecting every township (except Liucun), the transportation landscape of the entire prefecture will be greatly improved.

After liberation, the Communist Party and the People's Government adopted various measures to help the people of all ethnic groups develop their economy and get rid of poverty. Over the past seven years, the state has issued more than 20 million yuan in agricultural loans and more than 4.5 million yuan in various relief funds and gratuitous subsidies. In Malizhai, Yuanyang County, in the past, twenty households could not afford a cow, ten households could not afford a pig, and three households could not afford a chicken; but by 1953, on average, three households had a cow, one household had a pig, and twelve chickens. "Prosperous livestock, flocks of chickens and ducks, and happy people" is their description of the new life.

In the past, there was a saying here: "Ants cannot cross the river, and the Yi people do not study." For example, in Yuanyang County, there was only one primary school in the past, which was open to some wealthier people. The people of all ethnic groups said: At that time, we were "flowers without pots." Now Yuanyang has 90 primary schools, and there are also middle schools.

With the improvement of the cultural level of the people of all ethnic groups, and with the Party and the government carefully cultivating and promoting them, ethnic minority cadres are growing rapidly. At present, there are 3,898 ethnic minority cadres in the entire prefecture, accounting for 29.4% of the total number of cadres. Most of the rural grass-roots organizations are ethnic minority cadres.

Now, the people of all ethnic minorities in the entire prefecture, together with the Han people, are united around their own ethnic minority cadres and Han cadres, and are advancing firmly along the road pointed out by Chairman Mao and the Communist Party. (Attached picture)

    红河两岸
    ——云南红河哈尼族彝族自治州介绍
    本报记者　章皆淳
    云南是一个迷人的高原，滇南的红河哈尼族彝族自治州更是富饶而多姿。这里共有各族人口一百四十八万多，其中有汉族、哈尼族和彝、苗、僮、瑶、回、傣、白、蒙古、满、藏、佧佤、傈僳、拉祜等族。
    红河哈尼族彝族自治州地处著名的红河的两岸，紧挨着我们亲密的邻邦越南民主共和国。它包括红河、金平、元阳、蒙自、屏边、开远、建水、弥勒、龙武、曲溪、石屏、河口十二个县和一个相当于县的六村办事处，是由原来的红河哈尼族自治区和蒙自专区合并而成的。蒙自是自治州的机关所在地。在这块面积三万二千五百平方公里的亚热带肥沃的土地上，红河带着红色的波涛在四时常青的哀牢山间奔腾，河两岸是一片片齐整几百级的梯田，直升到高高的山头，构成了一幅壮丽的图画。如果是在冬天或春天，早上还可以欣赏奇异的红河云海，雾气在河谷里翻腾，群峰在云雾中若隐若现，这时你不禁会想起蓬莱仙境，七仙女下凡等等神话来。而在夏天，只要你有兴趣，从炎热的河谷一直往上爬，爬过凉风习习的山坡，登上云雾缭绕的观音山顶，你还可以欣赏到茫茫一片的雪景！
    红河流域还是有名的“鱼米之乡”。一位同志给我谈起，他们曾在藤条江
  （红河支流）中，用一个手榴弹就炸了两百多斤鱼。梯田中的田鱼，既肥且嫩。红河中的大黄鱼一条有几十斤重。石屏县异龙湖的干条鱼，肉细且厚，有的甚至比猪肉还厚。红河县的油鱼，肉嫩油多，都是为人称道的特产。又有大如小鸡的鱼雀，不但肉味可口，骨头也软酥酥的。如果碰巧，只要花上比猪肉多一两倍的钱，你还可以吃到难得的山精熊掌和鹿蹄筋。热带水果，如香蕉、椰子、菠萝、密多萝、芒果、龙眼、木瓜……，这里都出产，你喜欢什么就有什么。还有红河岸上的水多质细的鲁沙梨，蒙自县粒大味甜的蒙自石榴，建水县的吃后口中转甜的酸石榴，也都是颇有风味的特产。
    这里也是云南花生、甘蔗的主要产区。花生产量占全省总产量的三分之一，蔗糖产量占全省总产量的四分之一。去年，蒙自县十里馆农业社的三千零九十一亩花生，每亩平均产了二百三十六斤，曲溪的四千七百零三亩甘蔗，平均每亩产了一万零三百三十五斤。这里也是发展棉花的好地方，去年曲溪的三千七百三十八亩棉花，平均每亩产皮棉六十八斤，最高的达到一百二十五斤。在第二个五年计划中，这里的棉花将从现在的年产五千六百四十八担，提高到七万五千担。这里还是发展橡胶的理想地方。这里也是药材的宝库，名贵的草果每年可收五十多万斤，是全国产量最多的地方。桂皮、三七、鹿茸、柴胡、防风、木香、槟榔等这里都有出产。这里还产有木棉、紫胶、板枝花、香茅、咖啡、可可、柠檬、漆、樟脑、油茶等等热带作物。
    这里还有九十万公顷的森林，其中有很大一部分是经济价值很高的原始森林；森林中有孔雀、长臂猿和整天抱着树睡觉的风猴等等珍禽异兽。煤、铁、铜、云母、朱砂、水银及金、铝、锌、锑、钨、锰、钼等稀有金属矿藏，几乎每个县都有好多种。
    水力资源也极丰富，单是四百公里的红河，所蕴藏的能量就比目前全国的水电总容量大一倍多。
    可是，在过去，这块富饶的土地并没有给人民带来幸福。矿藏几乎是全部原封未动，原始森林只有避难时才有些用处，生产出来的东西也多为土司、地主和反动政府抢走。为了自己的幸福生活，各族人民曾进行了英勇的斗争。1948年春天，西山的阿细人和圭山地区的撒尼人（都是彝族支系），首先起义反对国民党反动统治者的压迫。随后，自治州各地都燃起了反抗的火焰。数以万计的少数民族人民跟汉族一道参加了共产党领导的云南地下武装。他们吹起古老的牛角，燃起火把，拿起猎枪和大刀，在深山老林里和国民党匪军搏斗。1949年，他们配合人民解放大军歼灭了残匪。
    解放后，在党的民族政策光辉的照耀下，在各族人民同心协力奋斗下，红河哈尼族彝族自治州的人民在短短的七年多的时间里，已跑过了过去几百年内所不能想像的距离。粮食方面，1956年的总产量已比1952年增长了40．9％，提前一年超额7．5％完成了第一个五年计划，由缺粮区一跃而为余粮区。经济作物方面，1956年的产量和1952年比较，花生是375．5％，蔗糖是177．8％，烤烟是474％。而今年的农业总产值，又将比去年增长8％左右。地方工业方面，解放前只有三个规模很小的破烂不堪的国营厂矿和六个私营厂矿，1956年已有地方国营和公私合营厂矿三十二个；今年又新建、扩建了六十多个，基建投资为去年的十一倍。今年生产总值预计将达三百四十九万多元，为1952年的七倍，为第一个五年计划的200．3％。今年手工业总产值预计将达一千三百三十三万元，为合作化前1955年的364．5％。交通方面亦在改观，年底碧河线修通后，滇越铁路纵贯南北，碧石铁路横穿东西，再加上长达三百三十五公里的十四条新修公路，和乡乡都通的电话邮路（除六村外），全州的交通面貌将会大大改观。
    解放后，共产党和人民政府采取多种办法帮助各族人民发展经济，摆脱贫困。七年多来，国家发放了农业贷款二千多万元，各种救济款、无偿补助款等四百五十多万元。元阳县的麻栗寨，过去二十户养不起一头牛，十户养不起一口猪，三户养不起一只鸡；但到1953年，平均三户就有一头牛，一户一口猪，十二只鸡。“六畜兴旺，鸡鸭成群，人心快乐。”这是他们对新生活的描述。
    过去这里有这样的话：“蚂蚁不过河，彝族不读书。”如元阳县，过去只有一所小学，为一些较有钱的人开放着。各族人民说：那时我们是“有花没盆栽”。现在元阳已有小学九十所，而且还有了中学。
    随着各族人民文化水平的提高，随着党和政府精心在意的培养和提拔，民族干部在迅速的成长着。目前全州民族干部已有三千八百九十八人，占干部总数的29．4％。农村基层组织中大半是民族干部。
    现在，全州各少数民族人民，正和汉族人民一道，团结在他们本民族干部和汉族干部的周围，沿着毛主席和共产党指出的道路，坚定不移的前进。（附图片）
