    Two Million Farmers in Shanxi
    Break Frozen Soil to Build Water Conservancy Projects

    Over two million farmers in Shanxi Province are braving the early winter cold to carry out water conservancy construction.

    In the frozen northern frontier region of Jinbei, 450,000 farmers have completed more than half of the planned work volume for farmland water conservancy and soil conservation in the past month, which is more than half of the planned work volume for this winter and next spring. Farmers in Hequ County, near the east bank of the Yellow River, are breaking frozen soil to build 30 water conservancy projects.

    In the Taihang and Taiyue mountain areas of southeastern Shanxi, many small-scale water conservancy projects have been completed one after another. On the plains of southern Shanxi, groups of people digging canals and wells can be seen everywhere, with competition red flags fluttering on the construction sites.

    Agricultural Cooperatives Establish Nurseries

    In the five townships of Fujiazhai, Zhaogang, etc., in Guanghua County, Hubei Province, 41 agricultural cooperatives have established nurseries, cultivating more than 20 kinds of tree seedlings such as pine, fir, mulberry, and black locust. The seedlings are now growing very vigorously. It is estimated that more than 1.2 million seedlings can be released from the nurseries this winter, enough to afforest more than 9,000 mu of barren hills.

    These five townships have more than 300,000 mu of barren hills. In the past, most of the tree seedlings used for afforestation every year were small saplings sprouted from large trees dug from the wild on a temporary basis. The roots of the small trees were injured when dug out, making them difficult to survive. In addition, tree seedlings brought back from forest farms were also greatly damaged by wind and sun. Therefore, they decided to establish their own nurseries. (Xinhua News Agency)

    山西二百万农民
    敲开冻土修水利
    山西省二百多万农民冒着初冬的寒风，在进行水利建设。
    已经封冻的晋北塞外地区，四十五万农民在最近一个月内完成的农田水利和水土保持的工作量，等于今冬明春计划工作总量的一半以上。靠近黄河东岸的河曲县农民，正在敲开冻土兴建三十处水利工程。
    在晋东南的太行、太岳山区，许多小型水利工程目前已陆续完工。在晋南平原上，目前到处可以看见开渠打井的人群，工地上飘扬着竞赛红旗。
    农业社建立苗圃
    湖北省光化县傅家寨、赵岗等五个乡中，有四十一个农业社建立了苗圃，培育有松杉、桑树、洋槐等二十多种树苗。现在树苗都长得十分茁壮。预计今年冬天能出圃一百二十多万株树苗，够绿化荒山九千多亩。
    这五个乡共有荒山三十多万亩。过去每年造林时用的树苗，绝大多数是临时到野外挖来的大树旁分蘖出来的小树秧，小树的根在挖出时受伤，不容易活。另外从林场里弄回来的树苗，经过风吹日晒，也受到很大损伤。所以他们决定建立自己的苗圃。　（新华社）
