Xinhua News Agency, November 11th, London: The British magazine "New Statesman and Nation" published an article on the 9th titled "Science Fiction and Scientific Fact," urging Western countries to accept peaceful coexistence.

The article stated: "The Soviet satellite has opened a new chapter in the history of mankind's conquest of nature; are we really so foolish as to regard these two satellites merely as a new stage in the Cold War?"

The article condemned the attitude of Western rulers. It said that the Soviet Union's new scientific achievements "have caused unease, almost panic, especially in the United States. The United States will use more money for crash programs to produce intercontinental missiles; the scope of security measures will be further expanded. Moreover, there are concerns that these measures may be imposed on British science as the price for sharing those 'secrets' that the Russians apparently already possess. Most disturbing is that a proposal seems to have been made to remove treaty restrictions prohibiting West Germany from nuclear rearmament. This seems to be a way to start World War III. Why should we expect Russia to allow Germany, which ravaged its country just fifteen years ago, to rearm with nuclear weapons?"

The article pointed out: "Since it is absolutely impossible to use war as an instrument of policy, it would be extremely foolish to use Russia's superiority in intercontinental missiles to stir up a new 'Red Scare'. It is frightening to hear Mr. Dulles and Mr. Macmillan utter phrases that people were very familiar with and extremely unrealistic ten years ago. The first thing to understand is, of course, that Western policy all these years has been based on the assumption of Western superiority, which is now certainly outdated. We really have no other choice but coexistence or destruction."

    苏联卫星粉碎了西方优势论
    美英除却接受共处别无他途
    英“新政治家与民族”杂志这样说
    新华社11日讯　伦敦消息：英国“新政治家与民族”杂志9日登载了一篇题为“科学幻想和科学事实”的文章，要求西方国家接受和平共处。
    这篇文章说：“苏联卫星在人类征服自然的历史上揭开了新的一章；难道我们真的愚蠢到这种程度，竟然要把这两颗卫星仅仅当作是冷战的新阶段吗？”
    文章谴责西方国家的统治者的态度。它说苏联科学的新成就“特别是在美国引起了不安，几乎可以说引起了惶恐。美国将把更多的钱用于生产洲际导弹的突击计划；安全措施的应用范围将进一步扩大。而且，人们担心这些措施可能被强加于英国科学，作为共同享有那些显然早已为俄国人所掌握的‘秘密’的代价。最令人不安的是：看来已经提出取消不准西德进行核武器重新武装的条约限制的建议。这似乎是发动第三次世界大战的一种办法。为什么我们要指望俄国允许就在十五年前蹂躏了自己国家的德国再用核武器重新武装起来呢？”
    文章指出：“既然确确实实不可能把战争当作政策的工具，那末利用俄国在洲际导弹方面的优势来掀起一次新的‘红色恐怖’将会是一件极端愚蠢的事。听到从杜勒斯先生和麦克米伦先生嘴里喊出十年以前人们就很熟悉而且极不现实的词句真是令人害怕。第一件应当了解的事当然是，所有这些年来西方政策一直是以西方优越这一假定为基础的，这一假定现在肯定已经过时了。除了共处或者毁灭以外，我们的确没有其他的选择。”
