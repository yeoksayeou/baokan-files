How Wang Sheren Township Carried Out Village Consolidation
Zheng Song

After the socialist great debate in Licheng County's Wang Sheren Township, Shandong Province, three villages and village party branches (the first-class Chengguan Village, the second-class Sheng Sheng Village, and the third-class Hongqi Village) were selected from the township's twenty-three villages and thirteen party branches to carry out pilot work for rectification and party consolidation. Rectification and party consolidation were closely integrated with village consolidation, and the work was roughly divided into four steps:

First, on the basis of the great debate, ideological preparation for rectification was carried out among the key leading cadres of the party branch and the village committee. The various opinions put forward by the masses in the previous stage were classified and ranked, a core leadership for rectification was established, production was arranged, and ideological and organizational preparations were made. Second, rectification was carried out among the key leading cadres of the branch and the village. Third, rectification was carried out among all party members, Youth League members, and non-party cadres above the level of production team leader. Fourth, organizational measures were taken against party members, Youth League members, and cadres who had committed various errors, the leadership of the party and Youth League branches and the village committees was re-elected, systems were established, the results of the rectification were consolidated, and the momentum of rectification was promptly shifted to a production upsurge.

Through such planned and step-by-step rectification, some of the more common and prominent problems within the villages, such as undemocratic practices, cadres not participating in productive labor, non-disclosure of financial accounts, cadres borrowing money arbitrarily, chaotic expenditures, extravagance and waste, and embezzlement and theft, were basically resolved. In the past, the phenomena of corruption, degeneration, embezzlement of public funds, and squandering were extremely serious among the party branch and village leading cadres of Hongqi Village, and some individuals had even degenerated. After this rectification, problems were seriously and solemnly dealt with, the leadership of the branch and the village was re-elected, and work style was transformed. The masses reflected, "If we continue to do things this way, the cooperative will definitely be run well."

The reason why the rectification and party consolidation in these three villages were able to achieve good results was mainly because the following issues were grasped and resolved:

I. Correct the attitude of cadres and party members and overcome ideological obstacles to rectification and party consolidation. At the beginning of the rectification, cadres and party members had resistance. The more common situations were of two types: cadres and party members with serious shortcomings and errors were afraid of being punished, afraid of accounting and looking for money from outside, afraid of retaliation from the masses, afraid of losing prestige and face, and afraid that the airing of views would lead to chaos; those without serious shortcomings and errors believed that the great debate in the previous stage was sufficient, and that rectification was not important, so at the beginning of the rectification, some were unwilling to participate, while others were apprehensive and wanted to escape under various pretexts. In order to enable party members and cadres to raise their understanding and dispel their concerns, the following aspects of work were emphasized: (1) Presenting the correct criticisms raised by the masses in the previous stage of great airing and great debate, analyzing the shortcomings and errors in the leadership within the party and the village, and the current situation of party members and cadres, and repeatedly explaining the significance, purpose, and guiding principles and policies of rectification;

(2) Based on the specific thinking of party members and cadres and the different ideological sentiments at each stage, strengthening education through meetings of all sizes and individual talks to make them realize that they must thoroughly rectify and transform their work style. During the process of mass airing of views, cadres with serious errors were greatly shaken and felt very nervous, requiring more patient assistance and not simple treatment. Except for those who resolutely resisted rectification, there should generally be no rush to punish them, giving them a chance to correct their mistakes. After this work, Wang Zhenming, the party member and village chief of Sheng Sheng Village, who was originally afraid of being punished, consciously examined his mistake of embezzling 25 yuan and only working for three days in a year and a half, made a plan to repay the money, immediately participated in productive labor, and mobilized the masses to boldly air their views and make suggestions. At the beginning, many branch committee members of Chengguan Village believed that there was no wind to rectify. After presenting the problems, analyzing the demands of the masses, and the current situation within the party, more than 200 opinions were presented, making them realize that "rectification is truly necessary." This strengthened their determination to rectify and reform, and as a result, they not only made good self-criticisms and reformed quickly, but also boldly mobilized the masses to put forward 840 criticisms and suggestions.

II. Firmly believe in the masses and let go of mobilizing great airing and great debate. On the one hand, correcting the cadres' idea of only wanting to rectify among cadres and not wanting to meet with the masses for closed-door rectification; on the other hand, breaking the masses' concerns about helping the leadership with rectification. The masses' main concerns about helping cadres with rectification were fear of retaliation from party members and cadres, fear of being criticized for saying the wrong thing, fear that suggestions would not be implemented, and fear that cadres would label them. In order to dispel these concerns, the following measures were taken to mobilize the masses to boldly air their views: (1) Repeatedly explaining the policies of rectification through mobilizations and forums of all sizes;

(2) The work team, branch, village committee, and cadres of each production team repeatedly expressed their attitude to the masses, resolutely not retaliating. Those individuals with serious errors who resisted rectification and obstructed the masses from airing their views were suspended from their duties for self-criticism or temporarily transferred away from their units; (3) Rectifying and reforming as views were raised, rectifying while rectifying, and immediately rectifying what could be rectified, demonstrating the determination to rectify with practical actions;

(4) Stipulating and announcing the discipline that party members and cadres should abide by during the airing of views (such as not allowing retaliation, not allowing beating or cursing, not allowing sectarian activities, opposing only talking and not acting, leading production well, etc.); (5) Based on the characteristics of busy farming seasons, adopting various forms such as large meetings, small meetings, individual connections, suggestion boxes, blackboards, and door-to-door visits, and persisting in mobilizing from within the party to outside the party, from key personnel to the masses at all levels. In this way, these three villages aired more than 1,600 opinions in just three or four evenings. The vast majority of the opinions raised were well-intentioned and correct.

III. Start with production and carry out rectification in the midst of a production upsurge, so that rectification promotes a production upsurge. From the pilot projects in the three villages, it seems that this approach is good, and production and rectification can be combined. However, there are also some specific contradictions that need to be resolved when these two tasks are carried out simultaneously: (1) First of all, it must be ideologically clear that rectification must be closely integrated with production and further promote production, overcoming the idea of attempting to take out a single period of time to carry out rectification and party consolidation, as well as the tendency in actual work to only focus on rectification and not production, detaching from production to carry out rectification.

(2) Implement a division of labor from the township and village to the production team, with some people responsible for rectification and some people responsible for production, strengthening specific guidance. (3) In the specific steps, methods, and time arrangements of the work, taking into account that both production and rectification are not neglected. At the beginning of the rectification, first make the current production plan, arrange production well, and launch production, then carry out rectification. During the rectification process, generally adopt the method of producing during the day and rectifying at night, reporting and inspecting both rectification and production simultaneously. When farm work is particularly busy, shorten the evening rectification time or suspend meetings for several nights. Immediately after the basic conclusion of rectification, shift the momentum of rectification to further launching a production upsurge. (4) Emphasize that cadres change their work style, rectify while rectifying, take the lead in participating in production, and provide specific guidance to production. Because of the importance attached to resolving the contradiction between rectification and production, although the rectification period was in the midst of the busy farming season of drought resistance, wheat planting, and late autumn harvesting, not only did it not affect production, but it vigorously promoted production. Chengguan Village not only overfulfilled the wheat planting task, but also started farmland water conservancy construction one month earlier than last year.

IV. Implement the spirit of rectifying while rectifying from beginning to end. Not only must rectification be bold, resolute, and thorough, but the principle of rectifying while rectifying must be implemented throughout, so that some cadres who have made mistakes can demonstrate their determination to correct their mistakes through practical actions. This is an extremely arduous task. To this end, we have carried out the following work: (1) Repeatedly explaining to party members and cadres the determination and importance of rectification, criticizing the idea of muddling through, so that they have the determination to rectify. (2) Inspecting and checking opinions as they are raised, rectifying where inspections reach, formulating a rectification plan, checking the implementation on schedule, and publishing the plan to the masses for supervision. (3) In terms of the content of rectification, first grasping those issues that are common, serious, and easy to rectify, and that will have immediate results after rectification; for those that are difficult to rectify all at once, first proposing methods to gradually rectify; in this way, grasping important issues to rectify prominently, easily reflecting the results of rectification, and boosting the confidence of the masses. For example, at the beginning, the masses of Hongqi Village did not believe in rectification, but after grasping the common and serious problems in the village – cadres borrowing public funds arbitrarily, eating, drinking, and wasting, chaotic finances, and not participating in labor – and proposing 20 specific corrective measures and immediately putting them into action, they immediately gained the trust of the masses.

V. Implement the class line, strengthen organizational construction, and consolidate the results of rectification. Focus on solving three problems: (1) Making organizational arrangements for cadres and party members who have made mistakes, based on their specific situations. In the handling process, it is necessary to draw clear lines between general selfishness and individualism and serious capitalist ideological behavior that cannot be corrected after repeated education, between opinions on the shortcomings and errors of the cooperative and essentially opposing cooperation and creating trouble to withdraw from the village, as well as between general coercion and commandism and violations of laws and discipline, between general work style problems and serious corruption and degeneration beyond redemption, between general blurred class boundaries and unstable positions and class alien elements, between those who have not done work due to special difficulties and those who have lost revolutionary will, and other principles and boundaries, and to clarify the scope of responsibility of each person in the common mistakes made by several people. Based on these principles, treat them differently. Oppose both simple punishment and unprincipled appeasement and leniency. For example, Sheng Sheng Village expelled Li Shuyi, a bad element who had infiltrated the party and the former branch secretary (deputy village chief), from the party and dismissed him from his position as deputy village chief, while Wang Zhenming, who had made a profound self-criticism during the rectification, had a firm position, consistently worked actively, but had serious errors, regained the trust of the masses and was re-elected as village chief. The masses were very satisfied with this handling, saying: "Wang Zhenming and Li Shuyi are essentially different. If he has made mistakes and corrected them, he is still a good cadre." (2) Establishing a system to fix the results of rectification and the improved opinions from the system. (3) Doing a good job of organizational construction, transforming and improving the organization. Consolidating the results of rectification ideologically, organizationally, and institutionally.

From the pilot projects, the most central issue in organizational construction is to implement the class line, grasp the leadership of the branch in the hands of outstanding party members, and establish the leadership advantage of poor and lower-middle peasants in the village. Pay attention to cultivating backbone at the beginning of rectification. Examine the implementation of the position and class line within the party, clarify class viewpoints, so as to ensure the establishment of the leadership advantage of poor and lower-middle peasants in the village.

    王舍人乡是怎样进行整社的
    郑松
    山东历城县王舍人乡在社会主义大辩论之后，即在全乡二十三个社十三个党支部中选择三个社和社支部（一类社城关社、二类社升生社、三类社红旗社）进行整风整党的试点工作。整风整党与整社紧密结合，工作大体分为四步：
    第一步，在大辩论的基础上，在党支部和社委会的主要领导骨干中进行整风的思想酝酿，并将前段群众鸣放出各种意见进行分类排队，建立整风的核心领导，安排好生产，作好思想准备与组织准备。第二步，进行支部和社的主要领导骨干的整风。第三步，进行全体党员、团员和生产小组长以上非党干部的整风。第四步，对犯有各种错误的党员、团员和干部进行组织处理，改选党团支部和社委会的领导，建立制度，巩固整风成果，并将整风的劲头及时转上生产高潮方面。
    经过这样有计划有步骤的整顿，一些社内较普遍、突出的问题，如办事不民主；干部不参加生产劳动；财务账目不公开，干部乱借款，开支混乱；铺张浪费，以及贪污盗窃等，基本上解决了。原来红旗社的党支部和社的领导干部中，贪污腐化堕落挪用公款挥霍浪费的现象极为严重，个别的并已蜕化变质。经过这次整风，认真严肃地处理了问题，改选了支部和社的领导，转变了作风。群众反映：“照这样办下去，合作社一定会办好”。
    这三个社整风整党所以能够收到较好的效果，主要是掌握和解决了以下几个问题：
    一、端正干部和党员的态度，克服整风整党的思想阻碍。干部党员对于整风开始有抵触情绪。比较普遍的是两种情况：有严重缺点错误的干部和党员怕受处分，怕算账向外找钱，怕群众打击报复，怕失去威信丢人，怕鸣放乱了；没有什么严重缺点错误的则认为有了前段大辩论就行了，整不整无关紧要了，因而整风开始有的不愿参加，有的则提心吊胆，想借故脱逃。为了使党员干部提高认识解除顾虑，抓紧了以下几方面的工作：（1）摆出前段群众大放大鸣提出的正确批评，分析党内和社内领导上存在的缺点错误和党员干部的现状，反复说明整风的意义目的和方针政策；
  （2）根据党员干部的具体思想和各个阶段的不同思想情绪，通过大会小会个别谈话等办法，加强教育，使其认识到必须彻底整顿转变作风。在群众鸣放过程中，错误严重的干部震动很大，心情紧张，更需要耐心帮助，不可简单对待。除了是坚决抗拒整风的，一般不要急于处分，给他改正错误的机会。经过这样工作，原来怕受处分的升生社党员社长王振明，自觉检讨了贪污二十五元和一年半只干了三天活的错误，订出还款计划，马上参加生产劳动，并到处动员群众大胆的鸣放提意见。城关社开始不少支委认为无风可整，经过摆问题分析群众要求和党内现状，摆出了二百多条意见，使他们认识到“不整真不行”。坚定了整改决心，结果不仅检讨好，改的快，而且还大胆地发动群众提出八百四十条批评和意见。
    二、坚定地相信群众，放手发动大放大鸣。一方面纠正干部只愿在干部中整不愿与群众见面的关门整风的想法；另一方面打破群众帮助领导整风的顾虑。群众对帮助干部整风的主要顾虑，是怕党员干部打击报复，怕说错了受批驳，怕提了不改，怕干部扣大帽子。为了解除这些顾虑，便采取下列措施发动群众大胆鸣放：（1）通过大小会动员座谈，反复讲明整风的政策；
  （2）工作组和支部、社委会及各生产队干部，反复向群众表明态度，决不打击报复。对个别错误严重对抗整风阻挠群众鸣放的，则停职检讨或暂时调离本单位；（3）随提随改，边整边改，能改的马上改，以实际行动表明整改决心；
  （4）规定与宣布党员干部在鸣放中应遵守的纪律（如不准打击报复，不准打人骂人，不准搞宗派活动，反对光说不作，领导好生产等）；（5）根据农忙特点，采取大会提，小会谈，个别串连，信箱，黑板报，登门访问等多种形式，并且坚持从党内到党外由骨干到群众层层发动。这样，这三个社仅三、四个晚上即鸣放出一千六百多条意见。所提意见绝大部分是善意的正确的。
    三、从生产入手，在生产高潮中进行整风，使整风推动生产高潮。从三个社试点来看，这样做法是好的，生产整风是可以结合的。但是这两个工作同时进行也有一些具体矛盾需要解决：（1）首先必须在思想上明确整风必须紧密结合生产和进一步推动生产，克服企图单拿出一段时间进行整风整党的想法，以及在实际工作中只管整风不管生产脱离生产去整风的偏向。
  （2）从乡社到生产队实行分工，一部分人负责整风，一部分人负责生产，加强具体指导。（3）在工作的具体步骤方法和时间安排上照顾到生产整改两不误。在整风开始时，首先作出当前生产计划，安排好生产，将生产发动起来，然后再进行整风。在整风过程中，一般的采取白天生产晚上整风，对整风和生产同时进行汇报检查，农活特别忙时，则缩短晚上整风时间或暂停几个晚上的会议。整风基本结束之后立即将整风的劲头转上进一步发动生产高潮。（4）强调干部转变作风，边整边改，带头参加生产，具体指导生产。由于重视解决了整风与生产的矛盾，虽然整风时期正处在抗旱种麦和收割晚秋的紧张农忙季节里，不仅没有影响生产，反而有力的推动了生产。城关社不仅超计划完成了种麦任务，而且比去年提前一个月展开了农田水利建设。
    四、把边整边改的精神贯彻始终。不仅要大胆的改，坚决的改，彻底的改，而且要始终贯彻边整边改，使一些犯有错误的干部能够以实际行动表现改正的决心。这是一项极为艰巨的工作。为此我们进行了以下工作：（1）反复向党员干部讲明改的决心和重要意义，批判蒙混过关思想，使他们有改的决心。（2）随提意见随检查，检查到那改到那里，制定改的计划，按期检查执行情况，并将计划向群众公布，让广大群众来监督。（3）在改的内容上首先抓住带有普遍性严重性而又易于改，改了以后马上见效的立即改；对于一些难于一下子改的，先提出办法逐步改；这样抓住重要问题改的突出，容易体现整改成果，鼓舞群众信心。例如红旗社，开始群众对整改不相信，经过抓住该社普遍而严重的问题——干部乱借公款，吃喝浪费，财务混乱，不参加劳动等问题，提出了二十条具体纠正办法，并马上见诸行动后，便立即取得了群众的信任。
    五、贯彻阶级路线，加强组织建设，巩固整改成果。重点解决三个问题：（1）犯有错误的干部和党员，分别情况作好组织处理。在处理中必须划清一般的自私自利个人主义和严重资本主义思想行为屡教不改的，划清对合作社的缺点错误有意见和本质上反对合作化闹退社的，以及一般性的强迫命令和违法乱纪，一般的作风问题和严重腐化堕落不可救药的，一般阶级界限模糊立场不稳和阶级异己分子，因有特殊困难未作工作和丧失革命意志的等等原则界限，并且划清在几个人共同所犯错误中每个人应负责任的范围。根据这些原则，分别对待。既反对了简单惩办，又反对无原则的姑息迁就。如升生社将混入党内的坏分子前支书（副社长）李树义开除出党并撤消其副社长职务，而在整风中已作了深刻检讨，立场坚定工作一贯积极但有严重错误的王振明，则又取得群众信任，重新当选为社长。这样处理群众很满意，说：“王振明和李树义是本质上的不同。有错改了后，还是好干部。”（2）建立制度，把整风成果和改进意见从制度上确定下来。（3）作好组织建设，改造与健全组织。从思想上、组织上、制度上巩固整风成果。
    从试点来看，在组织建设中最中心的问题，是贯彻阶级路线，把支部领导权掌握在优秀党员手里，树立贫农和下中农在社内的领导优势。整风开始就要注意培养骨干。在党内检查立场和阶级路线的执行情况，明确阶级观点，以保证树立贫农下中农在社内的领导优势。
