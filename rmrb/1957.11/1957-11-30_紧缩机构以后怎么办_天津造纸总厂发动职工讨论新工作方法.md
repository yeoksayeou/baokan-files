Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, November 29th - After the Tianjin Paper Mill streamlined its institutions by half in late October, reducing the number of cadres by 45%, the original work system could no longer adapt to or was not fully suitable for the new situation. The factory leadership then mobilized workers to conduct special "blooming and contending" discussions on this issue in order to simplify procedures and improve work.

The factory's workers responded to the call and put forward a large number of opinions. For example, in the past, the laboratory stations in each workshop were led by the factory's laboratory. In addition to the tests done by the laboratory stations, the production workshop itself had to do thirty-two tests every shift, wasting a lot of manpower. Now, after the streamlining of institutions, the laboratory stations have been transferred to the leadership of each workshop. In this special "blooming and contending," workers put forward opinions, and with the approval of the leadership, the original thirty-two tests per shift that the workshop had to carry out have been cancelled. In the past, workers in the power workshop received materials on a one-time basis, even if they needed a screw they had to fill out a card; now the material requisition procedure has been improved, with the workshop uniformly requisitioning materials and then distributing them to the workers, who find it very convenient.

This month, when the factory was conducting experiments on using Timothy grass to make paper instead of wood pulp, it changed the past procedure of requiring review by four or five departments such as technology, testing, and dispatching, and instead the production section was solely responsible, with the factory director personally leading the effort. Work that would have taken a long time to experiment with in the past is now completed in just over ten days.

    紧缩机构以后怎么办
    天津造纸总厂发动职工讨论新工作方法
    新华社天津29日电　天津造纸总厂在10月下旬，将原有机构紧缩了一
  半，干部减少了45％以后，原有的工作制度已不能适应或不完全适应新的情况。工厂领导方面便发动职工对这个问题进行专题鸣放，以便简化手续改进工作。
    全厂职工响应号召提出了大量意见。如过去各车间的化验站是归厂里的化验室领导，除了化验站所做的化验外，生产车间本身每班还要做三十二次化验，浪费了很多人力。现在机构紧缩后，化验站已划归各车间领导。职工在这次专题鸣放中提出意见，经领导同意已把车间原先每班要进行的三十二次化验取消了。过去，动力车间的工人领料是用一次领一次，即使领一个螺丝也要卡片；这次改进了领料手续，由车间把材料统一领来，然后分配给工人，工人感到很便利。
    本月份，这个厂进行用龙须草代替木浆造纸试验时，改变了过去要经过工艺、化验、调度等四、五个部门审核的程序，而由生产科统一负责，厂长亲自领导。这项在过去需要很长时期试验的工作，现在只花十多天就做成功了。
