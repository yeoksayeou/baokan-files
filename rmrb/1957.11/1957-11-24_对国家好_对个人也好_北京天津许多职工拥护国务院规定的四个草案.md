Xinhua News Agency, November 22nd: After the State Council announced the four draft regulations including the "Provisional Regulations on the Handling of Retirement for Workers and Staff," the majority of workers in Beijing have diligently read the original text. Workers in many factories have also held discussion sessions. Many veteran workers, in light of important issues raised during the rectification movement in their factories, provided socialist education to young apprentices, pointing out that the spirit of the four draft regulations announced by the State Council aligns with the interests of the working class. Some young apprentices also believe that the "Provisional Regulations (Draft) on the Apprenticeship Period and Living Allowances for Apprentices" proposed by the State Council are reasonable.

	To Master Skills, One Must Work Hard for Several Years
	Apprentices and veteran workers at the Beijing No. 1 Machine Tool Plant held four consecutive discussion sessions on the 21st and 22nd. Veteran instructors Song Yutian and Zheng Tongsheng stated at the meetings that the proposed measures regarding the apprenticeship period and living allowances for apprentices in the draft are not only considering the interests of the country but also the interests of young people. Zheng Tongsheng gave an example, saying that an apprentice was promoted to a Grade 1 artisan after only being at the factory for a little over a year, but his technical skills were very low. Now, he can't work when switching to a different lathe. What good is this for the country or for him? To master skills, one must work hard for several years. He believes that the three-year apprenticeship period proposed in the draft is very correct.
	This factory had recently held a debate on the issue of apprentice wages. Liu Xiande, an apprentice who previously thought his "wages were low" and his "life was hard," has now become an active advocate in the factory for promoting these drafts after his understanding changed. He said: "The veteran instructor told me that a farmer sent his son to the factory as an apprentice, and in less than six months, the apprentice was earning 34 yuan a month, which was several times higher than his father's income as a farmer. The villagers know how skilled this apprentice is, and the farmers have a lot of opinions about this."
	More than 700 extra copies of the newspaper containing the four draft regulations were purchased by over a thousand apprentices at the North China Radio Equipment Factory, compared to usual. Apprentice Ma Lianbi was once dissatisfied with the 29 yuan a month he received from the factory and posted a big-character poster saying "29 yuan is starvation." Later, with the help of his colleagues, he realized that his thinking was wrong and said that "starvation" was not in line with the facts. After seeing the measures regarding the apprenticeship period and living allowances in the draft on the 21st, he excitedly said to his colleagues, "Now we have a goal to strive for. In the future, we must maintain a hardworking and simple lifestyle and put our minds on production." On the afternoon of the 21st, five veteran workers from this factory also reported their painful experiences as apprentices in the old society to the apprentices. They encouraged the apprentices to study technology diligently and not to haggle over food and clothing. They said, "We veterans can rest assured when we see you looking like members of the working class."

	Guaranteed Life in Old Age
	Many veteran workers spoke about the measures regarding the handling of retirement for workers and staff in the draft with infinite gratitude. They unanimously believed that the measures stipulated in the draft guaranteed the lives of veteran workers in their old age. Zhen Xuecheng, a veteran worker at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, said, "The country has thought of us so thoroughly. I will better train my apprentices and teach them all my skills so that they can take over after I retire." Chen Jianyao, a veteran worker at the state-owned Beijing No. 2 Cotton Textile Mill, was so excited that he couldn't sleep all night. He said, "The current society is truly paradise." Many veteran workers who are nearing retirement age suggested at the discussion sessions that the Party organizations should pay special attention to strengthening the education of young workers in the future.
	Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, November 22nd: After the State Council announced the four draft provisional regulations on the handling of retirement for workers and staff, workers in factories and shops in Tianjin launched heated discussions. On the 21st, many factories held various discussion sessions with veteran workers, young workers, apprentices, and odd-job workers. Some factories also convened worker representative conferences to convey and discuss these four documents.

	The state-owned Tianjin Textile Machinery Plant, which has more than a thousand apprentices, convened an expanded worker representative conference on the 21st with the participation of over 200 veteran workers, technicians, apprentices, and odd-job workers. During the discussion of the draft provisional regulations on the apprenticeship period and living allowances, many workers spoke. Apprentice Chi Lushan said that these regulations are very good. In the past, some apprentices only considered wages and benefits and neglected to learn skills, which affected their progress. With these regulations, apprentices can be guaranteed to learn skills better. Apprentice Wang Xiuqin stated that in the past, apprentices were upgraded too quickly. She was promoted to Grade 2 after only one year, and as a result, she couldn't even read assembly drawings, which not only caused losses to the country but also made her very distressed. Extending the apprenticeship period allows for better learning of skills.

	The Worker-Peasant Alliance Will Be Further Consolidated
	The broad masses of workers believed that the draft provisional regulations on retirement expressed the meticulous care of the Party and the government for the working people. Yu Zhide, a veteran worker at the Da Zhonghua Rubber Factory, said emotionally at the discussion session, "Before liberation, there was a female worker in our factory who fainted in the workshop due to illness. The capitalists had people carry her outside. After she died, they cruelly threw her in a pit. Now the Communist Party considers the working people in every way. Elderly workers can retire. I really don't know how to thank the Party and Chairman Mao." Wang Yuchun, a 54-year-old veteran salesman at the jointly owned Qianxiangyi Chenji Cotton Fabric Store, said that in the past, when working in private enterprises, when one got old, people would let you go if they didn't want you anymore. Today, elderly workers retire, and the state still provides retirement pay, which shows that our country has infinite care for elderly workers. He stated that in the very short years before his retirement, he must teach his accumulated business experience to young people.
	The draft provisional regulations on vacation and wage treatment for workers and staff returning home to visit relatives also aroused great interest among the workers. Hou Ruiqin, a salesperson at the Qianxiangyi Chenji Cotton Fabric Store, said that 60% of the families here are in the countryside. With this regulation, it can prevent family members from blindly flowing into the city. This can not only reduce the burden on urban housing and consumer goods supply but also reduce the burden on their own lives.
	The workers also had a heated discussion on the draft provisional regulations on the wage treatment of ordinary workers and odd-job workers. Many odd-job workers expressed their support for this regulation. Hei Wenzhong, an odd-job worker at the Textile Machinery Factory, said that the income of some odd-job workers exceeds that of ordinary farmers too much, which has a great impact on farmers blindly flowing into the city. The doorkeepers and cooks at the Hengyuan Yarn Factory believe that this regulation is of great significance for consolidating the worker-peasant alliance.
	During the discussion, many workers also raised suggestions for revising these draft provisional regulations.

    对国家好  对个人也好
    北京天津许多职工拥护国务院规定的四个草案
    据新华社22日讯　国务院关于工人、职员退休处理暂行规定等四个草案公布后，北京市广大职工都认真阅读了草案的原文，许多工厂的工人还举行了座谈会。很多老工人结合本厂在整风运动中所提出的一些重要问题向青年徒工们进行了社会主义教育，指出国务院公布的四个草案的精神是符合工人阶级利益的；有些青年徒工，也认为国务院所提出的关于学徒工的学习期限和生活补贴的暂行规定（草案）是合理的。
    要学好技术，就得苦干几年
    北京第一机床厂的学徒工和老工人，21日和22日连续举行了四次座谈会。宋玉田、郑彤升两位老师傅在会上说，草案中提出的关于学徒的学习期限和生活补贴的办法，不但是从国家利益着想，也是为青年人着想的。郑彤升举例说，有个徒工来厂一年多就升为一级工匠，其实技术水平很低，现在一换车床就不能干活。这对国家和他本人有什么好处呢？要学好技术就得好好地苦干几年。他认为草案中提出学徒学习三年的规定很正确。
    这个工厂不久以前曾就徒工工资高低问题进行过辩论，辩论前认为自己“工资低”“生活苦”的学徒工刘先德，在认识转变以后，现在却成为全厂向徒工宣传这些草案的积极分子。说：“老师傅告诉我，有个农民把自己的儿子送进工厂当学徒，不到半年，这个徒工每月就拿三十四元的工资，比他当农民的父亲的收入高好几倍。这个学徒工有多大本领，他的乡亲们是知道的，农民对这件事很有意见。”
    华北无线电器材厂的一千多个学徒工，比平时多买了七百多份刊有四个草案的报纸。学徒工马连壁曾对工厂每月给他二十九元的工资不满意，贴出“二十九元饿死人”的大字报，后来经过同伴们的帮助，才认识到自己的想法错了，说“饿死人”更不符合事实。他在21日看到草案中关于学徒的学习期限和生活补贴的办法后，兴奋地向同伴们说：“这下可有努力目标了，今后一定要保持艰苦朴素作风，把脑筋用在生产上。”21日下午，这个工厂的五位老工人还向徒工们报告了在旧社会当徒工的痛苦经历，他们勉励徒工们努力钻研技术，不要斤斤计较吃穿。他们说，看到你们像个工人阶级的样子，我们老一辈的人才放心。
    晚年生活有了保证
    很多老工人都怀着无限感激的心情谈论草案中提出的关于工人、职员退休处理的办法。他们一致认为：草案中所规定的办法使老工人的晚年生活有了保证。石景山钢铁厂的老工人甄学诚说：“国家为我们想得太周到了，我要更好地培养徒弟，把技术完全教给他们，在我退休后好让他们接班。“国营北京第二棉纺织厂老工人陈建瑶兴奋得一夜没睡好觉，他说：“现在的社会真是天堂”。许多快到退休年龄的老工人在座谈会上建议党组织今后要特别注意加强对青年工人的教育。
    据新华社天津22日电　国务院关于工人、职员退休处理等四项暂行规定草案公布以后，天津市工厂、商店的职工展开了热烈的讨论。21日，有许多工厂举行了老工人、青年工人、学徒工、勤杂工等各种座谈会，有的厂还召开了职工代表大会传达和讨论这四个文件。
    拥有一千多名学徒工的国营天津纺织机械厂，在21日召开了有二百多名老工人、技术人员、徒工、勤杂工参加的职工代表扩大会议。在讨论到关于学徒学习期限和生活补贴的暂行规定草案时，许多工人都发了言。学徒工迟禄山说，这些规定很好，过去有些徒工净考虑工资福利等问题，忽略了学习技术，因此影响自己的进步。有了这些规定，就能够保证徒工更好地学习技术。徒工王秀琴表示，过去由于徒工升级太快，她一年就升了二级工，结果连装配图也不能看，不但给国家造成损失，自己也很苦恼。延长学习期限以后，可以更好地学习技术。
    工农联盟将更加巩固
    广大职工认为关于退休的暂行规定草案，表示了党和政府对劳动人民无微不至的照顾。大中华橡胶厂老工人于志德在座谈会上激动地说：“解放前我们工厂有一个女工，在车间因病晕倒后，资本家让人把她抬到门外。在她死后，还残忍地把她扔在坑里。现在共产党处处为劳动人民着想，年老的工人可以退休，真不知应该怎么感激党和毛主席。”公私合营谦祥益辰记棉布店，五十四岁的老业务员王雨春说，过去在私营企业工作的时候，年老了人家不要了就得走。今天老年职工退休，国家还发给退休费，说明我们国家对老年职工是无限关怀的。他表示自己在退休以前的很短几年中，一定要把多年积累的业务经验教给青年人。
    工人、职员回家探亲的假期和工资待遇的暂行规定草案也引起了职工们的极大兴趣。谦祥益辰记棉布店售货员侯瑞勤说，我们这里有60％的人家属在农村，有了这项规定就可以防止家属盲目流入城市。这不但可以减轻城市住房和消费品供应等方面的负担，同时也可以减轻自己生活方面的负担。
    职工们对关于普通工、勤杂工的工资待遇的暂行规定草案也进行了热烈的讨论。许多勤杂工表示拥护这项规定。纺织机械厂勤杂工黑文忠说，有些勤杂工超出一般农民收入过多，这对农民盲目流入城市很有影响。恒源纱厂的看门工人和炊事员，认为这个规定对于巩固工农联盟有很重要的意义。
    在讨论中，许多职工还对这些暂行规定草案提出了修改意见。
