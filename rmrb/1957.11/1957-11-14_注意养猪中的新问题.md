Post-Editing Notes

    Recently, in the Jinhua Special District of Zhejiang Province and the Xiangtan Special District of Hunan Province, there have been instances of farmers being unwilling to raise sows and market prices for piglets falling. Analysis suggests that the primary reason is due to one-sided propaganda about conserving grain.
    Grain must be conserved, but it absolutely cannot be said that conserving grain means one cannot raise a large number of pigs. Examples and experiences of raising a large number of pigs without using staple grains exist in many places. Facts demonstrate that there is no irresolvable contradiction between conserving grain and raising pigs!
    Both conserving grain and raising a large number of pigs are established national policies. As long as ideological education work is done well and specific problems are resolved, hog production can still develop. The approach taken by Xiangtan Special District is timely and necessary.

    注意养猪中的新问题
    最近浙江省金华专区、湖南省湘潭专区都发生某些农民不愿养母猪、市场上小猪落价的现象，据分析原因，主要是由于对节约粮食的片面宣传引起的。
    粮食一定要节约，但是，决不能说要节约粮食，就不能大量养猪，不用主粮而可以大量养猪的范例和经验，各地都有不少。事实说明，节约粮食和养猪之间并不存在不可解决的矛盾！
    既要节约粮食又要大量养猪，这是国家既定方针，只要思想教育工作作好，具体问题得到解决，生猪还是能发展的。湘潭专区的作法是及时和必要的。
