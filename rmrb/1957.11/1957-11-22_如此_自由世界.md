Such a "Free World"

    The Fate of French Construction Workers
    According to official French statistics, two construction workers die every day on French construction sites due to work-related accidents.
    According to statistics from the French social insurance authorities, in 1955, there were 260,000 construction workers in the Paris area, and there were 60,000 construction-related accidents that year. This means that on average, one out of every four workers experiences an accident, injury, or death.
    A reporter from the French "l'Humanité" recently visited a French construction site to understand the living and working conditions of construction workers. He saw that the tall buildings under construction on the site lacked safety equipment. For example, some very high scaffolding had no protective equipment underneath, and workers could fall to their deaths with the slightest carelessness.
    The living conditions of construction workers are also very poor. Many workers live in simple, temporary houses built on the construction site. The rooms are dirty and overcrowded. After a day of hard work, it is difficult for workers to recover their energy in such polluted and dirty rooms. As a result, many workers have poor concentration during work hours.

    The Country with the Highest Alcohol Consumption
    France is the country with the highest consumption of wine and spirits in the world. Not long ago, the French monthly magazine "Réalités" published an article describing the drinking habits of the French and the consequences of drinking. According to statistics from the French National Institute of Demographic Studies, the total wine consumption in France in 1955 was 9.14 million hectoliters, with an average consumption of 22.5 liters per person, and 30 liters per adult.
    According to "Réalités," the mortality rate of French people between the ages of 35 and 40 is currently very high, and one-third of these deaths are due to alcohol poisoning. On average, about 20,000 French people die from alcohol poisoning each year. At the same time, alcoholism causes many criminal cases. According to statistics, 50% of juvenile offenders and more than 60% of adult offenders are alcoholics or grow up in families of alcoholics.

    如此“自由世界”
    法国建筑工人的命运
    据法国官方的统计，每天在法国的建筑工地上有两个建筑工人因工伤事故而死亡。
    又据法国社会保险机关的统计，1955年在巴黎区从事建筑的工人共有二十六万人，而这一年共发生建筑工伤事故六万次，就是说平均每四个工人中就有一个工人碰到事故受伤或死亡。
    法国“人道报”记者不久以前曾到法国的一个建筑工地上去了解建筑工人的生活和劳动条件，他看到工地上正在建筑中的高大的建筑物非常缺乏安全设备，例如有些很高的建筑木架下面没有装置任何防护设备，工人只要偶一不慎就有摔得粉身碎骨的可能。
    建筑工人的居住条件也很恶劣，很多工人就住在工地上临时搭盖的简陋的房子里。住室内很肮脏并且拥挤不堪。工人们在劳累了一天之后，回到这样空气污浊和肮脏的屋子里，很难恢复疲劳。因此很多工人在工作时间精神很坏。
    饮酒最多的国家
    法国是世界上酒与烈性饮料消费量最大的国家。不久以前法国“现实”月刊曾登载了一篇文章叙述法国人饮酒情况和饮酒造成的后果。据法国全国人口统计研究所的统计，1955年全法国酒的消费量是九百一十四万公石，平均每个法国人的消费量是二十二点五公升，而每个成年人的消费量是三十公升。
    据“现实”月刊说，目前从三十五岁到四十岁之间的法国人死亡率很高，而这些人中有三分之一死于酒精中毒，平均起来每年约有二万法国人死于酒精中毒。而同时酗酒造成了许多犯罪案件。据统计，50％的少年罪犯和60％以上的成年罪犯是酒徒或生长在酒徒的家庭中。
