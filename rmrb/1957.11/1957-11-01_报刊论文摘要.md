    Democracy is Only a Means
    We say that democracy is only a means, which is to say that, whether in politics or in any other area, promoting democracy is for a great purpose: to bring into play the enthusiasm of the broad masses of people for building socialism, to bring into play their enthusiasm for struggling against all anti-socialist forces, so as to build our country into a great socialist country better and faster. Conversely, all kinds of "absolute democracy" and "abstract democracy" that are not conducive to socialist transformation and socialist construction are what we resolutely oppose. The Rightists are completely different from us. They stand on the reactionary bourgeois position. They hate socialism and hate the system of the people's democratic dictatorship. They shout that the new China of people's democracy is a "dark kingdom without any democracy," where people "dare to be angry but dare not speak out," and even "do not have the freedom to be angry." Therefore, they believe that democracy should be strived for as an end in itself. What is the purpose of "striving for democracy"? They generally dare not say it publicly. However, everyone knows that they greatly admire the Hungarian incident. The reason why the Chinese Rightists admire the Hungarian incident and fantasize about a so-called "struggle for democracy" Hungarian incident in China is precisely for this purpose. Therefore, the debate over whether democracy is a means or an end is not only a debate over an academic issue, but also a component of the current struggle between two roads—the socialist road and the capitalist road. (Excerpt from Wenhui Daily, October 20, by Miao Menghuang: "Democracy is Only a Means")
    The Historical Tasks of the Democratic Parties in the Period of Socialist Revolution
    The historical task of the democratic parties during the period of socialist revolution is to educate the classes and strata they represent in socialism according to the six criteria for judging right and wrong indicated by Chairman Mao, especially the two criteria of socialism and the leadership of the Communist Party, and to help them complete their socialist self-transformation, rather than to represent their capitalist tendencies and demands, otherwise they will violate the laws of historical development and will not be able to represent their true interests. What are their true interests? It is to make the bourgeois elements and members of the bourgeois intellectuals abandon their capitalist stand and turn to the stand of the working class in the socialist transformation; to transform their political groups from bourgeois political parties into political forces serving socialism. (Excerpt from Deng Chumin, "Contending," October 1957: "The Current Political Orientation and Work of the Democratic Parties")

    报刊论文摘要
    民主只是一种手段
    我们说民主只是手段，这就是说，无论在政治方面，还是在其他任何方面，发扬民主都是为了一个伟大的目的：发挥广大人民建设社会主义的积极性，发挥他们同一切反社会主义的势力作斗争的积极性，以便更好更快地把我国建设成为一个伟大的社会主义国家。反之，一切不利于社会主义改造和社会主义建设的什么“绝对民主”、“抽象民主”之类，都是我们所坚决反对的。右派分子和我们完全不同。他们站在反动的资产阶级立场上。他们仇恨社会主义，仇恨人民民主专政的制度。他们大叫什么人民民主的新中国是“毫无民主的黑暗王国”，人们“敢怒不敢言”，甚至连“敢怒的自由也没有”。因此，他们认为，民主应当作为目的去争取。“争取民主”是为了什么呢？他们一般的都不敢公开地说出来。但是，大家知道，他们是非常欣赏匈牙利事件的。中国的右派分子所以欣赏匈牙利事件，并幻想在中国也来一个所谓“争取民主”的匈牙利事件，其目的也正在于此。因此，民主是手段还是目的的争论，不仅是一个学术问题的争论，而且是当前两条道路——社会主义道路和资本主义道路斗争的一个组成部分。　（摘自10月20日文汇报缪梦黄：“民主只是一种手段”）
    各民主党派在社会主义革命时期的历史任务
    各民主党派在社会主义革命时期的历史任务，就是要按照毛主席为我们指示的判别是非的六条标准，特别是社会主义和共产党领导的两条，去向他们所代表的阶级、阶层进行社会主义教育，帮助他们完成社会主义的自我改造，而不是去代表他们资本主义的倾向和要求，否则就要违反历史发展的规律，而不可能代表他们的真正利益。他们的真正利益是什么呢？就是要在社会主义改造中，使资产阶级分子和资产阶级知识分子的成员抛弃他们的资本主义的立场，转到工人阶级的立场上；把它们的政治集团，从资产阶级性的政党，改变成为社会主义服务的政治力量。　（摘自1957年“争鸣”十月号邓初民：“当前民主党派的政治方向和工作问题”）
