	Rent
	Yan Yizhong, Shijingshan Power Plant

	The club room was crowded with people. The room was filled with smoke, and the sunlight shone through the clean glass windows, forming many golden, transparent light columns. Wisps of light smoke seeped into the golden columns, making them particularly clear.

	Before the debate began, I was thinking, single dormitories also charge rent, I don't agree. Although the money is not much, no one has taken it in the eight years since liberation! Why did I have to run into it. As soon as I was about to say this thought, a young man stood up unsteadily.

	From his actions, I determined that it was Zhang Baoyou, an apprentice who entered the factory with me. He frowned, skillfully exhaled a thick white puff of smoke, and said, "I don't agree with collecting rent." I was satisfied with his speech and listened quietly. "In the past, the Japanese and Kuomintang eras did not collect rent. Aren't we comparing with the old society? Then let's compare. If rent wasn't collected before liberation, it shouldn't be collected even more after liberation. Isn't the Communist Party working for the welfare of the workers? What welfare is there if you charge rent for housing?" There was a rustling sound in the room. I was pondering whether his statement was correct. Old Master Li, who was in charge of ash removal, suddenly stood up, glanced at Zhang Baoyou, and said, "Let's talk about whether the rent should be collected first. It should be collected." Old Master Li said the three words "should be collected" in a particularly loud voice, which shocked everyone. "This can't be considered rent at all, it's just a little maintenance fee. Don't you have to repair your own house if it's broken? So I say it should be collected. Family dormitories should be collected, and youth worker buildings should also be collected. That's right! The Japanese didn't collect rent, they didn't build a brick or a tile, where would they collect it? They didn't even give enough to eat of mixed noodles, yet they would collect rent? Not to mention the Kuomintang, they didn't even build a toilet, what rent would they collect? In the early days of liberation, I lived in a small adobe house, and I was always worried that the house would collapse and hurt people when it rained. I couldn't sleep at night at all. How many houses have been built in the past few years! In the past, there were only twenty-eight families in our village, look at how many buildings there are now, just seven or eight."

	Old Master Li waved his hand, paused for a while, and recounted the bitter years of the past. His voice was hoarse. "I have lived in a single dormitory before liberation, which really didn't cost money, but it was living with livestock! I had to take care of the livestock at night. I really didn't want to sleep there, but what else could I do if I didn't sleep there?" Old Master Li sat down tremblingly, the wrinkles on his face, awakened by the past suffering, seemed very deep. I shivered, and my heart was contracting. After Old Master Li sat down, he said intermittently: "Let's compare and see if the rent should be collected."

	As soon as Old Master Li finished speaking, Master Liu from the boiler room followed up and said: "People can't forget their roots! I was working for the capitalists when I was fifteen years old. I didn't need to pay rent when I was an apprentice. They didn't pay wages, so where would they collect rent? They treated people like animals. At night, I guarded the door for the capitalists, and during the day, I looked after the children for the capitalist's wife. Did they still want rent? They drank all the human blood and peeled off a layer of skin. During the Kuomintang era, a dozen of us lived in a small room in the factory, and we didn't need to pay money, but when we were sleeping soundly at night, we were driven up to work the night shift. If we didn't go, the supervisor would hit us with a stick, making no one dare to sleep in this free room at night." Master Liu said here and looked at everyone. "You can ask the old masters, who doesn't know? I agree to collect rent."

	The room was silent for a while, people were thinking, and I was also thinking. The young people in the room were silent, and the words I wanted to say were swallowed back into my stomach.

	A stubborn young worker, sitting on the windowsill, shouted, "The old masters are right, but you have to take care of us bachelors! As the saying goes: 'Bachelors are bitter, no one mends the clothes of bachelors'."

	Everyone chuckled. I saw Master Ren, who was sixty-three years old, slowly stood up and coughed, and slowly said to the young worker: "What's so bitter about being a bachelor? An apprentice earns thirty odd yuan a month, which is stronger than an old master who has been in the factory for more than ten years. An old master earns ninety yuan to support seven or eight people, who is bitter? You have to compare! Besides, your bachelor building (youth worker building) has heating, and someone boils water for you, what's bitter about that? What, do you still want the leaders to find you a partner? Hey—you'd like that, but do people even want to be your partner?"

	Everyone laughed, shaking the whole room, and I couldn't help but laugh out loud. The young worker's face turned red, and he lowered his head and said nothing.

	At night, I lay in bed, looking at the clean white ceiling, deeply thinking about and recalling the debate during the day. Today I feel particularly comfortable, warm air, soft bedding, I feel satisfied and happy, how could there have been such an apprentice life in the past!

    房钱	石景山发电厂　阎一忠
    俱乐部屋里挤满了人。屋里弥漫着烟雾，阳光透过明净的玻璃射进屋里，形成许多金色的透明光柱，缕缕轻烟渗到金柱里面，分外清晰。
    辩论会开始之前我就在想，单身宿舍也收房租，我不同意，虽然钱不多，可是解放了八年谁也没拿过呀！怎么单单让我赶上了。这念头我刚要讲出去，一个小伙子晃晃悠悠的已经站了起来。
    我从他的举动，就断定是和我一同进厂的徒工张宝有，他皱了一下眉，熟练的吐出了一口浓浓的白烟说：“我不同意收房租。”我满意他的发言，静静地听下去，“过去日本、国民党时代都不收房租。不是和旧社会比吗？那就比比吧，解放前不收，解放了更不应该收，共产党不是给工人谋福利吗？住房收房租还有什么福利”。屋里一阵嗞嗞声，我正琢磨他的发言是否正确。除灰的李老师傅，霍地站了起来，看了张宝有一眼说：“咱们先说房钱该不该收，应该收”。李师傅把应该收三个字说的声音特别大，把大家镇住了。“这根本不能算房租，只是一点修缮费，自己的房子坏了不也得修吗，所以我说应该收。家属宿舍该收，青工大楼也应该收。对！日本不收房钱，他们没盖过一块砖，一片瓦，哪儿收去。吃混合面都不给饱还收房钱？国民党更不用提啦，连个厕所都没盖过，他收个屁。解放初我还住小土坯房，下雨老担心家里别塌了房伤了人。晚上根本不能睡觉，这几年盖了多少房啊！过去咱们村里才二十八家，你们看看现在光大楼就七、八座。”
    李老师傅把手挥了一下，停顿一会，述说起过去苦难的岁月，他的声音嘶哑了，“我住过解放前的单身宿舍，实实在在不要钱，可是，是和牲口住在一起呀！晚上还得照顾牲口，我真不愿睡在那里，可不睡在那又有什么办法呢？”李师傅颤巍巍坐了下去，脸上被过去苦难所唤起的皱纹显得很深，我打了一个冷战，心在收缩。李师傅坐下后断断续续的说：“比吧，看看该不该收房钱。”
    李师傅刚说完，锅炉场的刘师傅就跟着说：“人可不能忘本啊！我十五岁就给资本家干活，学徒时倒不要房钱，他不给工钱哪收房钱去。把人当牲口使唤，晚上给资本家看门，白天给资本家老婆看孩子，早起来给资本家倒夜壶。房钱还要哇？喝尽了人血还剥层皮。国民党时候，我们十几个人住在厂里的一间小屋里，也不要钱，可晚上睡得香香的，就给赶起来去加夜班，不去，监工拿棒子抽你，弄得晚上谁也不敢去睡这不要钱的房。”刘师傅说到这儿，看了看大家。“你们去问老师傅谁不知道，我同意收房钱。”
    屋内静寂了一会，人们在想，我也在想，屋里的青年人沉默了，我想说的话也咽到肚里去。
    一个楞头楞脑的青工，坐在窗台上嚷了起来，“老师傅说的对，可是得照顾我们光棍呀！俗话说：‘光棍苦，光棍衣裳破了没人补’”。
    大家吃吃地笑了。只见六十三岁的任师傅慢条斯理的冲着那个青工立起了身子，咳嗽了一声缓缓地说：“光棍苦什么？一个徒工一月拿三十来块，比进厂十几年的老师傅还强呢，一个老师傅挣九十块钱养活七、八口人，谁苦呀？得比一比！再说你们光棍楼（青工楼），有暖气，有人给烧开水，苦什么？怎么，还得让领导给找对象？嘿——你倒乐意呢，可是人家对象乐意不乐意呢？”
    哄地大家都乐了，振荡了整个屋子，我也禁不住哈哈大笑，那个青工弄得面红耳赤，低着头不言语了。
    晚上，我躺在床上，看着洁白的屋顶，深思着、回忆着白天的辩论会。今天特别觉得舒适，温暖的空气，软绵绵的被褥，我感到满足的快乐，过去那有这样的徒工生活呀！
