Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, November 8th: TASS reported from Tokyo that Tokyo Radio broadcast on the 7th a congratulatory message from Iichirō Hatoyama, President of the Japan-Soviet Association and former Prime Minister of Japan, to the citizens of the Soviet Union. Hatoyama said that forty years ago, a new socialist system was established in your country. Many foreigners doubted whether this new system could last for a long time... However, the Soviet Union has existed for forty years, and after overcoming all wars and other difficulties, the Soviet Union is advancing along the road of continuous progress and prosperity, which proves the close unity of all nationalities in your country.

Hatoyama then said that, as Prime Minister of Japan, after overcoming certain criticisms and difficulties, I firmly advocated the restoration of diplomatic relations between Japan and the Soviet Union. I was deeply convinced that Japan and the Soviet Union, which have been historically and geographically linked in the past and present, must have peaceful and friendly relations. The restoration of normal relations with your country is beneficial and appropriate for Japan, and Japan has become a member of the United Nations. I hope that we and your country will not only have formal diplomatic relations, but also sincere and friendly relations.

Hatoyama finally paid heartfelt respect to the citizens of the Soviet Union.

    鸠山电贺十月革命节
    希望发展日苏关系
    新华社8日讯　据塔斯社东京讯：东京广播电台7日播送了日苏协会会长、前日本首相鸠山一郎向苏联公民的祝贺词。鸠山一郎说，四十年前，在你们的国家里建立了新的社会主义制度。许多外国对这种新制度能否长期存在抱怀疑态度……。但是，苏联已经存在了四十年，苏联在克服了一切战争和其他困难以后，正沿着不断进步和繁荣的道路前进，这证明了你们国家各民族的紧密团结。
    鸠山一郎接着说，作为日本首相，我曾经在克服了某些批评和困难以后，坚决主张恢复日本和苏联之间的外交关系。我曾经深信，过去和现在在历史上和地理上有着联系的日本和苏联，一定会有和平和友好的关系。同你们国家恢复正常的关系对于日本是有利和适当的，日本成了联合国的会员国。我希望，我们和你们国家不仅有形式上的外交关系，而且有诚挚和友好的关系。
    鸠山一郎最后向苏联公民致衷心的敬意。
