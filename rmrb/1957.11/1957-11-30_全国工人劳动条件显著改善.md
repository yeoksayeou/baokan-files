Xinhua News Agency, 29th dispatch: The working conditions of workers in our country have greatly improved during the period of the First Five-Year Plan.

According to materials provided by the Labor Protection Department of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, if the frequency of worker injuries is taken as 100 in 1953, it had decreased to 55.08 by 1956; the number of people disabled due to work-related injuries in 1956 had also decreased to 28.41% of that in 1953. Incidents of occupational poisoning, heatstroke, and occupational diseases among workers have significantly decreased year by year.

The head of this department said that these achievements were made under the care of the Party and the state for the safety and health of workers. From 1953 to the present, the state has promulgated many laws and regulations related to labor protection; the central industrial and transportation departments have spent 290 million yuan on improving working conditions. All enterprises have made ensuring safe production one of the important contents of enterprise management. Trade union organizations at all levels have also done a lot of work. At present, there are more than 260,000 labor protection activists led by trade union organizations nationwide, assisting enterprise administrations in strengthening labor protection measures.

Currently, many key issues in safe production in various industrial enterprises in our country are being gradually resolved. For example, textile factories, where workshop temperatures often reached 40 degrees Celsius in the past during the summer, are now almost entirely equipped with ventilation and cooling equipment, reducing workshop temperatures to around 32 degrees Celsius. Coal mines, which were once called "living hells" by workers before liberation, have now undergone fundamental changes in their working conditions. More than 96% of the nation's state-owned coal mines have adopted mechanical ventilation, and the vast majority of underground workers can obtain an average of more than three cubic meters of fresh air per minute. The degree of mechanization of coal mining has also increased from 17% in 1952 to about 43%, and the proportion of underground mechanical transportation has reached more than 77%. In production environments with toxic gases and dust, measures such as dust extraction, smoke exhaust, sealing, and wet operations have been widely adopted. From the opening of the Xikuangshan Mining Bureau in Hunan in 1898 to 1947, a total of more than 90,000 workers died of silicosis in 49 years. Since liberation, due to the adoption of various measures, silicosis patients have been reduced to 1% of the total number of employees.

In addition, enterprises have also taken many measures to improve electrical safety, high-altitude operations, and safety during rainy season construction, as well as to reduce the intensity of heavy physical labor. After the State Council promulgated three decisions last year, including the "Factory Safety and Hygiene Regulations," all factories, mines, and construction units conducted inspections item by item, and the safety situation has been greatly improved.

In recent years, the commissioning of many newly built and renovated factories and mines has provided workers with very good working conditions. These factories and mines generally have a higher degree of automation and mechanization and have good air conditioning equipment. In newly built units such as coal mines and power plants designed with the help of the Soviet Union, various automated signals and equipment for preventing accidents are also installed.

Women workers never received protection in capitalist society. However, in all enterprises in our country, the provision of 56 days of maternity leave with full pay has been implemented, and many methods and systems to take care of women workers have also been stipulated. Many factories with a large number of female workers have established women's health rooms, canteens for pregnant women, rest rooms for pregnant women, as well as nursing rooms and nurseries, and have fixed substitutes to replace pregnant women during rest and women workers during breastfeeding.

    全国工人劳动条件显著改善
    据新华社29日讯　我国工人的劳动条件在第一个五年计划期间有了很大改善。
    据全国总工会劳动保护部提供的材料，职工的负伤频率如果以1953年为一百，到1956年已下降为55．08；因工残废的人数在1956年也已下降为1953年的28．41％。职工的职业中毒中暑以及职业病现象逐年都有显著减少。
    这个部的负责人说，这些成绩是在党和国家关怀工人安全和健康的情况下取得的。从1953年到现在，国家公布了许多有关劳动保护的法令；中央各工业和交通部门用于改善劳动条件的经费就达二亿九千万元。各企业单位都把保证安全生产列为企业管理的重要内容之一。各级工会组织也做了不少工作。现在全国有二十六万多个由工会组织领导的劳动保护积极分子，协助企业行政加强劳动保护措施。
    目前我国各工业企业中，许多安全生产的关键问题正在逐步得到解决。例如过去夏季车间温度常达摄氏四十度的纺织厂，现在几乎全部装置了通风降温设备，车间温度降低到三十二度上下。解放以前被工人称为“活地狱”的煤矿，现在的劳动条件已经有了根本改变。全国国营煤矿96％以上的矿井都采用了机械通风，绝大多数井下工人平均每分钟能得到三立方公尺以上的新鲜空气。采煤的机械化程度也已经从1952年的17％提高到43％左右，井下机械运输的比重更已达到77％以上。在有有毒气体和粉尘的生产环境中，广泛采取了抽尘、排烟、密闭和湿式作业等措施。湖南锡矿山矿务局从1898年开矿到1947年的四十九年中总计有九万多职工因患矽肺病而死。解放以后因为采取了各种措施，矽肺病患者已降低到占职工总人数1％。
    除此以外，各企业在改进用电安全、高空作业和雨季施工的安全和减轻繁重体力劳动的强度等方面，也都采取了很多措施。去年国务院公布了工厂安全卫生规程等三个决定以后，各生产厂矿和建设单位都逐条进行了检查，安全情况有了更大的改进。
    几年来许多新建和改建厂矿的投入生产，更为工人们提供了十分良好的劳动条件。这些厂矿自动化机械化的程度一般都比较高，并且具有良好的空气调节设备。在苏联帮助设计的煤矿、电厂等新建单位中，还都装有各种防止事故的自动化信号和设备。
    女工在资本主义社会中是从来得不到保护的。但是在我国所有的企业中，都已经执行了休产假五十六天、工资照发的规定，同时还规定了许多照顾女工的办法和制度。许多女工多的工厂都设立了妇女卫生室、孕妇食堂、孕妇休息室以及哺乳室、托儿站等，并设有固定代替工代替孕妇休息和女工哺乳时间的工作。
