Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, November 12th: Shanxi Province, after large-scale geological surveys and explorations during the First Five-Year Plan period, has been confirmed as a treasure trove with extremely rich underground mineral resources. As many as fifty-four types of minerals have been discovered here.

Of the one hundred counties and cities in Shanxi Province, eighty-eight have coal seams. The province's coal reserves are over 400 billion tons. Iron reserves have increased more than twofold compared to pre-liberation estimates during the five years of exploration.

Exploration has proven that Shanxi's copper reserves are among the richest in China, and large quantities of lead and zinc mines have also been found in many areas. In addition, rare metals such as molybdenum, nickel, aluminum, manganese, and piezoelectric quartz have also been newly discovered in Shanxi.

The reserves of sulfur and gypsum are even more abundant. The Jin-Northwest region up to the Wutai Mountain area is a continuous sulfur mining area. The province's gypsum reserves are approximately 400 million tons or more.

    山西地下资源多
    煤铁铜矿极丰富硫磺石膏量更足
    据新华社太原12日电　在第一个五年计划期间经过大规模地质普查、地质勘探的山西省，已经证实是我国地下矿藏极为丰富的一片宝地。在这里发现的矿藏达五十四种之多。
    山西省一百个县市中，八十八个县市有煤层。全省煤藏量在四千亿吨以上。铁的储量在五年的勘探中已比解放前估量增加二倍以上。
    勘探证明，山西铜的蕴藏量是我国最丰富的地区之一，在许多地区还找到了大批铅锌矿。此外，在山西还新发现了稀有金属如钼、镍、铝、锰、压电石英等。
    硫磺和石膏的埋藏量更为丰富，晋西北地区直到五台山地区，是一片连绵不断的硫磺矿区。全省石膏的蕴藏量约在四亿吨以上。
