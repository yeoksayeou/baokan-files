Xinhua News Agency Report: France's long-term government crisis has temporarily come to an end. Radical Party member Félix Gaillard has formed a new cabinet, the twenty-fourth since the war. The National Assembly approved his appointment as Prime Minister late on November 5th, with 337 votes in favor and 173 against.

Since officially accepting the mandate to form a government from President Coty on October 29th, Gaillard has gone to great lengths to bring all the major and minor parties in the National Assembly, except for the Communist Party and the extreme right-wing "Poujadists," into his cabinet in order to cobble together a majority of support in the parliament. Among the seventeen ministers in the new cabinet, four are Socialists, three are from the Popular Republican Movement, three are Conservatives, three are from the Radical Socialist Party, and the remaining four belong to other parties. It is, in reality, a complex combination, in which conservative forces play a major role.

Before the vote in the National Assembly, Gaillard delivered a forty-minute speech requesting authorization. Trying to avoid disputes among the parties participating in the government, Gaillard did not put forward any binding long-term program in his entire speech.

Observers have expressed doubt about how long the Gaillard cabinet can last and whether it can work effectively.

    法国长期的政府危机暂告段落
    激进党人盖伊阿组成新阁
    人们对新内阁有多长寿命表示怀疑
    据新华社讯　法国国民议会5日深夜批准由激进社会党人盖伊阿担任法国战后第二十四届总理，组织新内阁。投票结果是三百三十七票对一百七十三票。
    自从在10月29日正式接受戈蒂总统的组阁委托以来，盖伊阿花了九牛二虎之力，把国民议会中除了共产党和极右翼的“布热德分子”以外的各个大小政党都拉进了他的内阁，以便拼凑到议会多数的支持。在新内阁的十七名部长中、四名是社会党人、三名是人民共和党人，三名是保守党人、三名是激进社会党人，另外四名分属其他党派。它实际上是一个成分复杂的结合体，而其中起主要作用的是保守力量。
    在国民议会举行投票之前，盖伊阿发表了历时四十分钟的要求授权的演说。由于力图避免在参加政府的各政党中引起争执，盖伊阿在通篇演说中没有提出任何带约束性的长期性纲领。
    观察家对于盖伊阿内阁究竟能够维持多久和它能否有效地进行工作表示怀疑。
