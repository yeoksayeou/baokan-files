"If anyone says that water conservancy cannot be developed in large mountainous areas, then please ask them to go to the Mingxing Fourth Agricultural Cooperative in Xijiadian Township, Jun County, and see the heroic deeds of Zhang Renchang, the cooperative director and Communist Party member, who led the cooperative members to build an eight-li long irrigation canal on a cliff." This was what the water conservancy visiting group, composed mainly of township branch secretaries from eight counties in the northern Hubei mountain area, such as Yunxi and Zhuxi, said after visiting this cooperative recently.

Recently, I also visited this cooperative. The cooperative director, Zhang Renchang, excitedly led me to the site for a visit. A thrilling picture suddenly appeared before my eyes. It turned out that this eight-li long irrigation canal was built on the mountainside, winding through eight mountains. Above the canal were oddly shaped boulders everywhere, and below the canal was a straight cliff with many deep pools of water several yards deep at the bottom. At the northern end of the canal, there was a small river. The cooperative members built a large dam with stones here to raise the water level in the river and force the water into the canal.

Zhang Renchang recalled the scene of opening the canal here at that time, saying: "There was not even a five-inch wide foothold on the mountain originally. Many cooperative members said: 'Opening a canal on such a steep mountain is really joking with one's own life. Who doesn't want to eat rice, but we were born with mouths for eating sweet potatoes. How can we succeed in wanting to eat rice?'" Zhang Renchang and four brave cooperative members, including Communist Youth League member Luo Xianzhong, in order to overcome people's conservative thinking and turn dreams into reality, first used ropes of more than ten yards long, tying one end to a large stone and the other end to their waists, hanging themselves on the mountainside to conduct drilling and other exercises, so that the cooperative members could visit from the foot of the mountain. After two exercises, the cooperative members became bolder. Then, they used this method to divide more than ten cooperative members into a class, taking turns going up the mountain to blast the mountain, dig the canal, and build the canal embankment with stones. In the construction of the canal, many thrilling deeds occurred. Once, several cooperative members lost their footing and accidentally dropped knives, axes, and other tools from the mountain into the pool at the bottom of the cliff, seriously affecting the progress of the project. The cooperative members were all worried around the pool. At this time, production team leader Zhu Jinyi and Communist Youth League member Zhao Yixian volunteered to go down to retrieve them, but the cooperative members could not bear to let them go down, risking their lives, some persuaded and some pulled, but they unexpectedly jumped into the pool with a plop. By the time they had retrieved all the items from the water, their mouths were frozen black.

The self-sacrificing spirit of Zhu Jinyi and Zhao Yixian moved many cooperative members to tears and stimulated the enthusiasm of all cooperative members to build the canal, making them even more energetic. This eight-li long irrigation canal was started last winter and completed in April this year, more than twenty days ahead of the original plan. The total investment was only more than 140 yuan, but this irrigation canal can convert more than 400 mu of dry land on the hillside into paddy fields. This year, this cooperative initially converted more than 70 mu of terraced fields according to the labor situation, and all of them were planted with rice seedlings. The average yield was 400 jin of rice per mu, with a total harvest of more than 28,000 jin of rice, an increase of nearly three times compared with dry land. Before this, the entire cooperative did not have a single mu of paddy field. Only during the New Year, miscellaneous grains or firewood were used to exchange for one or two jin of rice in the city as refreshments. This year, each person averaged more than 90 jin of rice, changing the life that was previously described by the cooperative members as "four months of pumpkin, eight months of sweet potato." The cooperative members said gratefully: "When we eat fragrant white rice, we think of the cooperative cadres and Party and League members."

At present, the cooperative members are more enthusiastic about water conservancy construction than in the past. The entire cooperative plans to convert another 120 mu of fields this winter and next spring. The cooperative members sing their self-composed songs in a bold manner: We are not afraid of the deep cliffs of ten thousand feet, We don't care if the mountains are high enough to reach the sky, As long as the cooperative members are determined, River water can also go up the mountain.

    悬崖上修渠道
    新华社记者  张国翰
    “要是有人说，大山区无法兴修水利的话，那就请他到均县习家店乡明星第四农业社，看看社主任、共产党员张仁昌是怎样带动社员们，在悬崖上修成一条八里长引水渠的英雄事迹吧。”这句话，是鄂北山区的郧西、竹溪等八个县以乡支部书记为主组成的水利参观团，最近到这个社里参观后说的。
    最近，记者也到这个社访问。社主任张仁昌兴奋地领着我到现场参观。一幅惊险的图画，顿时呈现在眼前。原来这条八里长引水渠，是在大山腰修成的，渠道盘绕经过八座山。在渠的上面，到处是奇形怪状的大石块，渠下面是笔直的悬崖，崖底下有许多几丈深的大水潭。在渠道的北端，有条小河，社员们就从这里用石头筑了一个大拦河坝，使河里的水位抬高，逼水入渠。
    张仁昌回忆当时在这里开渠的情景说：山上原来连五寸宽落脚的地方都没有，许多社员说：“在这样陡的山上开渠，真是拿自己的命开玩笑，谁不想吃大米，可是生就吃红薯的嘴，想吃大米怎能成。”张仁昌和共青团员罗贤中等四个勇敢的社员，为了克服人们的保守思想，把梦想变成现实，他们首先用十几丈长的绳子，一头捆在大石块上，一头系着腰，把自己吊在半山腰，进行打炮眼等演习，让社员们在山下参观，经过两次演习，社员们都胆大了。接着，就用这种办法，把十多个社员编成一班，轮流上山，一面炸山、一面开凿渠道和用石块砌渠埂。在修筑渠道中，出现了很多惊心动魄的事迹。有一次，几个社员因立脚不稳，猛一失手，把刀、斧等东西从山上掉到悬崖下的水潭中，严重影响工程进展，社员们都围在水潭边发愁。这时，生产队长朱金义和共青团员赵义仙自告奋勇下去捞，但社员们都不忍心让他俩下去，冒生命危险，劝的劝，拉的拉，但他俩却出人不意，扑通一声跳进潭里，等把东西全部从水里捞出时，他俩的嘴都冻乌了。
    朱金义和赵义仙俩人的自我牺牲精神，使许多社员感动得流泪，激发了全体社员的修渠热情，干劲更大了。这条八里长引水渠，从去年冬天动工，到今年4月间就比原计划提前二十多天修成功了。总共投资只一百四十多元，但是利用这条引水渠，可以把山坡上的四百多亩旱地改成水田。今年这个社根据劳力情况，初步改了七十多亩梯田，全部插上了秧。平均每亩收稻谷四百斤，共收两万八千多斤稻谷，比旱地增产将近三倍。在此以前，全社没有一亩水田，只有过年时，才用杂粮或柴草进城换回一、二斤大米当点心。今年平均每人分九十多斤稻谷，改变了过去被社员们形容为“四个月南瓜，八个月红薯”的生活。社员们感激地说：“自己吃喷喷香白米饭的时候，就想起了社干和党、团员。”
    目前，社员们兴修水利的劲头比过去更大，全社计划今冬明春再改田一百二十亩。社员们豪放地唱着自编的歌儿：不怕悬崖深万丈，那管山高能顶天，只要社员决心大，河水也能上山岗。
