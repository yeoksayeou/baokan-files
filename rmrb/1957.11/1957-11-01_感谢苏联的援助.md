    Thanking the Soviet Union's Assistance
    Shen Xiangshan, Director of the North China Pharmaceutical Factory
    Our North China Pharmaceutical Factory and its affiliated Starch Factory are among the 211 key projects aided by the Soviet Union in our country's construction. Since 1953, we have been carrying out various tasks with the assistance of the Soviet Union. Now, the Starch Factory has been officially put into production; the Pharmaceutical Factory will also be basically completed by the end of the year. During this period, we have gained a deep understanding of the great friendship of the Soviet Union.
    First of all, the Soviet Union used the most advanced technology to design our factory. Moreover, during the design process, as Soviet and world science and technology developed, some designs were immediately modified. For example, the extraction of the second product of the Pharmaceutical Factory, which adopted the most advanced ion exchange method, was a major improvement made during the detailed design stage. In order to support our construction, the Soviet Union supplied high-quality alloy steel and ethylene plastic pipes, and supplied us with thousands of brand-new equipment and instruments, some of which had just been successfully trial-produced in the Soviet Union and had not yet been used domestically. Whenever our country could not supply the equipment and parts, the Soviet Union always tried everything possible to supply them. For example, when two important ball bearings were damaged during the trial operation of the Starch Factory, which seriously affected the work, the relevant Soviet authorities, upon learning of this, quickly sent them to us by plane. This really moved us beyond words.
    During our factory's construction and trial operation, the Soviet Union sent 32 experts in succession to help us with our work. Each batch of experts, upon arrival, repeatedly stated that they had accepted the instructions of the Soviet Party and government to help us with all their ability in the spirit of internationalism. Originally, the Soviet Union had an annual vacation system, but they were unwilling to take vacations and worked diligently for us year after year. This selfless and noble quality is truly admirable.
    In their work, Soviet experts not only solved major technical problems for us, but also trained our young technicians through lectures and practical operations. For example, the mechanized warehouse project adopted the sliding formwork construction method, which had never been done in our country before. However, under the specific guidance of the experts, we now have a large number of workers who have learned it. The workers in our installation team could not weld stainless steel, but after the expert's hands-on teaching, a group of workers also learned it. Under the expert's specific guidance, hundreds of production technicians have grown up.
    Soviet experts are not only our teachers in industrial construction experience and technology, but their serious work attitude and down-to-earth work style also have a great enlightenment and educational effect on us. They often say that there should be no slightest sloppiness or carelessness in dealing with scientific and technical issues. In our work practice, we have deeply realized the correctness of this view.
    The October Revolution Day is coming, and the working people of the world are rejoicing over the great achievements of the Soviet Union. The Chinese revolution and socialist construction are advancing victoriously along the path that the Soviet Union has already taken, and with the active support of the Soviet Union. Therefore, in celebrating the October Revolution Day, we should first of all extend our heartfelt thanks to the Soviet Union, and continue to learn from the Soviet Union's advanced experience and advanced technology, and unite and struggle to complete our country's socialist construction and safeguard world peace.

### 感谢苏联的援助

    感谢苏联的援助
    华北制药厂厂长　申象山
    我们华北制药厂和所属淀粉厂，是苏联帮助我国建设的二百一十一项重点工程之一。从1953年以来，我们就在苏联的援助下进行着各项工作。现在，淀粉厂已正式投入生产；制药厂也将在年底基本上建成。这期间，我们对苏联的伟大的友谊有深刻的体会。
    首先，苏联用了最先进的技术来为我们工厂设计。而在设计过程中，随着苏联及世界科学技术的发展，又即时修改了部分设计。例如制药厂第二种产品的提炼，采用了最先进的离子交换法，就是在施工图设计阶段做的重大改进。为了支援我们的建设，苏联供应了优质合金钢材及乙烯塑料管材，并供应了我们数千台崭新的设备及仪表，其中有的是苏联刚试制成功，在国内还未使用过。凡是我国自己不能供应的设备及部件，苏联总是想尽一切办法供应。如淀粉厂试车损坏了两盘重要的滚珠轴承，严重影响工作的时候，苏联有关方面得知后，迅速用飞机给我们送来。这真使我们感动得说不出话来。
    在我们建厂和试车期间，苏联曾先后派来三十二位专家帮助我们工作。每一批专家到来，都反复表明他们接受苏联党和政府的指示，要以国际主义的精神，尽其所能帮助我们。本来在苏联有一年一度的休假制度，但是他们竟不愿休假，而成年累月为我们辛勤的工作。这种忘我的高贵的品质，令人万分感佩。
    苏联专家在工作中一方面为我们解决了技术上的大问题，一方面通过讲课与实际操作，培养了我们年青的技术人员。如机械化仓库工程是采用活动模板施工法，这在我国从来没有搞过。但经过专家的具体指导，现在我们已有成批的职工学会了。我们安装队的工人不会焊接不锈钢，经过专家手把手的教导，也有一批工人学会了。在专家这样具体的教导下，已有几百个生产技术人员成长起来。
    苏联专家不但是在工业建设的经验上和技术上堪为我们的老师，他们严肃的工作态度与踏实的工作作风，对我们也有很大的启示和教育作用。他们常说，对待科学技术问题不应有丝毫的苟且和马虎。我们在工作实践中深刻体会到这种意见的正确性。
    十月革命节就要来到了，全世界劳动人民都为苏联的伟大成就而欢欣鼓舞。中国革命和社会主义建设是沿着苏联已经走过的道路，并在苏联积极的支援下胜利前进的。因此，我们庆祝十月革命节，首先应向苏联盟邦致以衷心的感谢，并要继续学习苏联的先进经验与先进技术，为完成我国的社会主义建设和维护世界和平而团结奋斗。
