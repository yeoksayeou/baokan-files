    East China Builds Six More Pairs of New Coal Mines
    Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, November 25th. Six more pairs of new coal mines in East China have started construction successively in the fourth quarter. According to the design capacity, the total annual output of these six pairs of mines can reach 1.77 million tons.
    These mines, the last to be built during the First Five-Year Plan period, are located in the Zaozhuang, Xinwen, and Jiawang mining areas, which are very close to the Jinpu and Longhai Railways. In the Jiawang mining area, the main shaft project of the Dahuangshan No. 2 mine started on October 20th, and by the end of October, the shaft had been sunk twenty-six meters; the new construction projects of the Wazhuang and Huli mines also started in November and are doing temporary engineering, respectively. The Zhuzibu mine in the Zaozhuang mining area and the Dongdu mine in the Xinwen mining area also broke ground in early November. The last mine to start construction, the Huangbei mine, will begin construction in early December.
    During the First Five-Year Plan period, the state built, renovated, and restored a total of thirty-eight pairs of mines in East China. Among them, the nineteen newly built pairs of mines alone, after all being put into production, can produce more than 7.9 million tons of coal annually. The newly added coal mine production capacity in East China within five years is equivalent to more than twice the highest annual output of the entire region during the enemy and puppet era in 1941.

    华东又建六对新煤井
    据新华社济南25日电　华东地区又有六对新矿井在第四季度先后动工兴建。按照设计能力，这六对矿井的年产总量可达一百七十七万吨。
    这些在第一个五年计划期间最后兴建的矿井，分布在距津浦、陇海铁路很近的枣庄、新汶和贾汪矿区。在贾汪矿区建设的大黄山二号矿井，主井工程已在10月20日动工，到10月底井筒已下凿二十六公尺；瓦庄和湖里矿井的新建工程，也分别在11月开工和作临时工程。在枣庄矿区建设的朱子埠矿井和在新汶矿区建设的东都矿井，也在11月上旬动土。最后动工的一个矿井——黄贝矿井，将在12月初动工兴建。
    在第一个五年计划期间，国家在华东地区新建、改建和恢复的矿井共有三十八对。其中单是新建的十九对矿井，全部投入生产后，每年就可以产煤七百九十多万吨。华东地区五年内新增加的煤矿生产能力，等于敌伪时代全区最高年产量1941年的两倍以上。
