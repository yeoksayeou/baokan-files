Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 4th: Soviet scientists Gorlov and Yakovlev stated in an article published in "Pravda" on the 4th that the successful launch of the second artificial satellite carrying an animal has brought the realization of human spaceflight a step closer.

    There are many problems to be solved in animal spaceflight, such as the air problem, the temperature problem, and the food problem in the sealed cabin. This requires the development of a series of automated equipment to solve these problems necessary for maintaining life.

    The article stated that recently, Soviet scientists sent animals into sealed cabins equipped with good equipment to altitudes of 200 to 210 kilometers for research, and no phenomena harmful to the body were found.

    However, the loss of body weight, the medical and biological effects of primary cosmic rays, solar particle radiation, and ultraviolet radiation are almost completely unstudied to this day. Up to now, relying on short-term flights of animals on rockets has not been able to obtain sufficiently accurate material on the effect of cosmic rays on organisms.

    Observing the condition of animals in the second artificial satellite can clarify these problems that are impossible to clarify under laboratory conditions or in general high-altitude flights. The second artificial satellite can study the effects of prolonged weightlessness on organisms and solve the problems related to centrifugal force.

    The authors said that it is quite natural that the satellite's first "passenger" is a warm-blooded animal - a dog - because the normal physiological state of dogs has been studied in detail.

    In order to clarify some specific issues, it may also be necessary to use monkeys, rodents, mollusks, and insects that are similar to humans. Using insects can provide convenient conditions for studying the effects of these factors on animal genetics.

    人类宇宙飞行又迈进一步
    据新华社莫斯科4日电　苏联科学家戈尔洛夫和雅可夫列夫4日在“真理报”上发表文章说，带有动物的第二个人造卫星的发射成功使人类宇宙飞行的实现又向前迈进了一步。
    动物的宇宙飞行中有许多问题需要解决，如密封舱内的空气问题、气温问题、食物问题等等。这就要制定一系列的自动装备来解决这些为了维持生命所必需的问题。
    文章说，最近苏联科学家曾经把动物放在装有良好装备的密封舱里送到二百到二百一十公里的高空进行研究，结果并没有发现任何对机体有害的现象。
    然而，体重的失去，原始宇宙射线、太阳的粒子辐射和紫外线辐射在医学和生物学方面的影响，直到现在几乎是毫无研究。到目前为止，依靠动物在火箭上短时间的飞行，还没有能获得关于宇宙线对有机体影响的足够准确的材料。
    观察第二个人造卫星中动物的情况，就可以弄清楚实验室条件下或一般高空飞行所不可能弄清的这些问题。第二个人造卫星可以研究长时间的失去体重的状态对有机体的影响和解决关于离心力的问题。
    作者说，卫星的第一名“乘客”是热血动物——狗，这是十分自然的，因为狗的常态生理状况得到过详尽的研究。
    为了阐明一些专门问题，还有可能要利用与人相类似的猴子、啮齿动物、软体动物和昆虫，利用昆虫可以为研究这些因素对动物遗传方面的影响提供方便条件。
