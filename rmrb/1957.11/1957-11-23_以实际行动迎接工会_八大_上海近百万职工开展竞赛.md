Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, November 21st: Nearly one million industrial workers in Shanghai are currently engaged in a socialist competition, taking practical actions to welcome the convocation of the Eighth National Congress of Trade Unions.

Ying Zhongfa, a technician at the state-owned Shanghai Second Textile Machinery Factory and elected as a representative from Shanghai to attend the Eighth National Congress of Trade Unions, completed the entire design work for a new tool on the evening of the 15th. Using this tool to replace manual processing of the louver parts on the fine spinning machine can save more than two hundred workdays per year, and the quality will also be improved. In the days before going to Beijing for the meeting, he is also studying a new tool used on cotton delinting machines. He said, "I want to dedicate a better gift to the 'Eighth National Congress.'"

Steel casting workers and open hearth workers at the Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant, cooperating with each other, cast a 21-ton rolling mill on the 15th, which could not be cast in the past. They are now also preparing to cast large castings of 25 tons or more. Employees of the Shanghai Machine Tool Plant also decided to produce eight more grinding machines in addition to completing this year's annual plan, and many workers have already set out individual guarantees.

Thousands of light industrial factories have joined the socialist competition. The Shiye Rubber Factory recently had more than 10,000 pairs of rubber shoes delivered late due to poor quality. After the factory conveyed the resolutions of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions representatives meeting, the workers immediately took action and found the reasons for the poor quality. They proposed that they not only make up for the task of 10,000 pairs of rubber shoes, but also strive to increase production by another 7,000 pairs by the end of the year. On the 14th, the China Record Factory created its highest record this year – a daily output of 37,179 records. Recently, fourteen workers at the Guan Le Ming Gold Pen Factory also created sixteen new production records.

The office staff of the Shanghai Battery Factory also took active action. After hearing that the workshop workers were having difficulties completing this year's increased production plan, they voluntarily requested to go to the workshop to support production. Now, this factory has eliminated the phenomenon of production disconnection, and they are preparing to strive for an extra fifteen days of output in addition to completing the entire increased production plan as a gift to the Eighth National Congress of Trade Unions.

    以实际行动迎接工会“八大”
    上海近百万职工开展竞赛
    据新华社上海21日电　上海近百万竞赛产业工人目前正在开展社会主义竞赛，以实际行动迎接工会第八次全国代表大会的召开。
    当选为上海市出席工会“八大”的代表、国营上海第二纺织机械厂技师应忠发，在15日晚上完成了一项新工具的全部设计工作。用这种工具代替手工加工精纺机上的叶子板零件，每年可以节约二百多个工作日，质量也有提高。在去北京开会前的这几天，他还在研究一种棉籽剥绒机上用的新工具。他说：“我要向‘八大’献出更好的礼物。”
    上海第三钢厂铸钢工人和平炉工人，相互配合，在15日浇出了一架过去不能浇铸的重达二十一吨重的轧钢机，现在还准备浇铸二十五吨以上的大型铸件。上海机床厂职工也决定在完成今年年度计划以外，再增产八台磨床，许多工人都已订出个人保证条件。
    数千个轻工业工厂投入了社会主义竞赛。实业橡胶厂前不久因为质量不好，有一万多双胶鞋脱期交货。厂里传达了市工会代表会议决议后，职工们立即行动起来，找到了质量不好的原因。他们提出，不但要补足那一万双胶鞋的任务，还争取到年底再增产七千双。中国唱片厂在14日创造了今年以来的最高纪录——日产三万七千一百七十九张唱片。关勒铭金笔厂最近也有十四个工人创造了十六个生产新纪录。
    上海电池厂的科室人员也积极行动起来了。他们听说车间工人完成今年增产计划有困难，便自动要求下车间支援生产。现在，这个厂已经消灭了生产脱节的现象，他们准备在完成全部增产计划以外，争取再超额十五天的产量，作为向工会“八大”的献礼。
