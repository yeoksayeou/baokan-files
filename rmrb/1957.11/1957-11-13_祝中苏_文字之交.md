    Celebrating the Sino-Soviet "Literary Exchange"
    Luo Zhinan

    On this "arduous and long" road, literature once fulfilled the task of "leading the way." Just as Russian literature in the late nineteenth century served as a precursor to the October Revolution, the introduction of Soviet literature to our country also played a vanguard role in the Chinese revolution. Since the May Fourth Movement, for approximately thirty-eight years, the translation and publication of Soviet-Russian literature has been one of the main tasks of the Chinese literary world. With the demand and support of a broad readership, this work not only did not falter due to "re-establishment of relations" or "severance of relations," nor was it interrupted by the persecution of "White Terror," but continued to develop, making Soviet-Russian literature the mainstream of modern world literature introduced to China: its impact was greater than that of any works from any other country.

    From Tolstoy, we learned about "literature for life": "Beauty" is merely a social value, and there is no such thing as art that is "beyond good and evil." From Dostoevsky, we learned about the kind souls of "the insulted and injured"; we learned that there are classes of oppressors and the oppressed in human society. From Gorky, we learned about the storm petrel in the storm, bravery, struggle, and confidence in future victory; we learned to "eliminate the enemy if he does not surrender."

    Soviet literature, inheriting the fine traditions of Russian literature, guided by Marxism-Leninism, has a more definite social purpose, pays more attention to expressing real life, and is closer to the masses. The task of writers is not only to explain the world but also to transform it; literary works are no longer rare objects for a few to appreciate, or pastimes for leisure, but spiritual food in the daily lives of the people.

    Due to the inevitable result of historical evolution, China and the Soviet Union share the same destiny; the material construction and cultural development of the two countries have a close, inseparable relationship. Therefore, the literatures of the two countries are also completing the same historical task on the same road, although the two countries have their own traditions and specific circumstances.

    In the forty years of the development of the Sino-Soviet "literary exchange," what we have been able to give is far less than what we have received. Some even say that the Chinese New Literature Movement since the May Fourth Movement is merely an imitation and translation of Soviet-Russian literature. This is close to exaggeration, but not far from the truth. If the intention of this statement is to encourage us to flourish our own creations, then the flaw can be reduced.

    It is foolish to strictly divide "yours and mine" in academics. The law of gravity was invented by an Englishman, Marxism by a German, and artificial satellites by a Soviet, but just because we are Chinese, do we not recognize or learn these truths? Moreover, we are too young, only eight years old, and it is only natural to learn from our forty-year-old big brother.

    In brotherly, sincere, and joyful friendship, teaching and learning enhance each other, and youth is indeed a great advantage. We can assert that under the guidance of vibrant and broad Marxism-Leninism, the socialist literary creations of our two countries will become even more prosperous, and the respective essential particularities of our two countries will become even more distinct and complete.

    祝中苏“文字之交”
    罗稷南
    在这“道阻且长”的路上，文学曾经尽过“带路”的任务。正如十九世纪后期俄罗斯文学曾经为十月革命作过先驱一样，苏联文学的输入我国也曾为中国革命起过前哨的作用。自五四以来，大约三十八年间，苏俄文学的翻译和出版一直是中国文学界的主要工作之一。在广大读者的要求和支持之下，这工作不但不曾因为“复交”“绝交”而动摇，或因为“白色恐怖”的迫害而间断，而且继续发展，使苏俄文学成为世界现代文学输入中国的主流：那影响的巨大是其他任何国家的任何作品所不能比拟的。
    我们从托尔斯泰知道“为人生的文学”：“美”不过是一种社会价值，并无所谓“超善恶”的艺术。我们从陀思妥耶夫斯基知道“被侮辱与被损害的”人们的善良的灵魂；知道人类社会中有压迫者和被压迫者的阶层。我们从高尔基知道暴风雨中的海燕，勇敢，斗争，确信将来的胜利；知道“敌人不投降就消灭他”。
    苏联文学，继承了俄罗斯文学的优良传统，以马列主义为主导思想，更具有一定的社会目的，更注重表现现实生活，更亲近群众。作家的任务不但要说明世界，也要改造世界；文学作品已经不再是供少数人欣赏的稀奇事物，或茶余酒后的消遣品，而是人民大众日常生活中的精神粮食。
    由于历史演化的必然结果，中苏两国是同一命运的；两国的物质建设和文化发展都有着血肉相联的密切关系。所以，两国文学也在同一道路上完成同一历史课题，虽然两国各有自己的传统和具体情况。
    四十年来，在中苏“文字之交”的发展过程中，我们所能给与的远不如我们所已接受的那么多。甚至有人说五四以来的中国新文学运动不过是苏俄文学的模仿和翻译而已。这近于夸张，但也离事实不远。倘若这句话的意旨是要鼓励我们自己繁荣创作，那就可以减少语病。
    在学术上严格划分“你的我的”是愚蠢的。发明地心引力是英国人，发明马克思主义的是德国人，发明人造卫星的是苏联人，难道我们因为我们自己是中国人就不承认，不学习这些真理吗？况且我们还太年轻，才八岁，向四十岁的老大哥学习正是当然的事。
    在兄弟般的真忱愉快的友情中，教学相长，而且年轻确是一大优点，我们可以断言：在富有生命力的博大的马列主义指导之下，我们两国的社会主义文学创作越发繁荣，我们两国的各自的本质的特殊性也就越发分明和完整。
