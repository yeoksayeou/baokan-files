Xinhua News Agency, November 14th: The 84th meeting of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress was held on the afternoon of November 14th.

After discussion, the meeting approved in principle the State Council's Regulations on Improving the Industrial Management System, the State Council's Regulations on Improving the Commercial Management System, and the State Council's Regulations on Improving the Financial Management System.

The meeting discussed Premier Zhou Enlai's proposal to "Request the Amendment of the Number of Times Provincial and Municipal People's Congresses Convene Each Year." This proposal stated: Article 10 of the Organic Law of Local People's Congresses and Local People's Committees at All Levels stipulates that the meetings of the Provincial and Municipal People's Congresses should be held twice a year, and provinces with inconvenient transportation may hold them once a year. In the past two years, many provincial people's committees have reflected that the main topics of the meetings of the Provincial and Municipal People's Congresses, such as economic construction, cultural construction, major political movements, local budgets, and final accounts, are inherently annual in nature. Once planned, they are carried out according to the plan. Within half a year, it is difficult to find a clear segment that reflects the overall results as an agenda to be submitted to the people's congresses at the same level for discussion and decision. Moreover, most provinces have vast territories, and representatives spend a long time traveling to and from meetings, which takes a long time. In addition, many representatives to the Provincial People's Congresses are leading comrades from counties and cities or advanced individuals from various production fronts. Their work and production are very busy, and holding too many meetings in the province will affect the completion of their tasks. In view of the above situation, it is suggested that Article 10 of the Organic Law of Local People's Congresses and Local People's Committees at All Levels, which stipulates that Provincial and Municipal People's Congresses shall meet twice a year, be changed to once a year. Before submitting the Organic Law of Local People's Congresses and Local People's Committees at All Levels to the National People's Congress for amendment, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress is requested to approve it first so that the provinces and municipalities can follow it.

Based on Premier Zhou Enlai's proposal, the meeting decided that Provincial and Municipal People's Congresses may convene once a year.

    全国人大常委会原则批准国务院三项规定
    改进工业、商业和财政管理体制
    并决定：省、直辖市人民代表大会会议可以每年举行一次
    新华社14日讯　全国人民代表大会常务委员会第八十四次会议在14日下午举行。
    会议经过讨论，原则批准了国务院关于改进工业管理体制的规定、国务院关于改进商业管理体制的规定和国务院关于改进财政管理体制的规定。
    会议讨论了国务院周恩来总理提出的“关于提请修改省、直辖市人民代表大会每年举行会议次数的议案”。这个提案说：地方各级人民代表大会和地方各级人民委员会组织法第十条规定关于省、直辖市人民代表大会会议每年举行两次，交通不便的省可以每年举行一次。最近两年，不少省人民委员会反映，由于省、直辖市人民代表大会会议的主要议题如经济建设、文化建设、重大政治运动、地方预算和决算等，有的本来就是年度性质的，有的一经规划之后，即按计划进行，在半年时间以内，很难找出一个明显的反映全面结果的段落作为议程，提到本级人民代表大会会议讨论和决定。又由于多数省的地区辽阔，代表参加会议旅途较长，费时较久；加以省人民代表大会代表很多是县、市的负责同志或者是各个生产战线上的先进分子，他们的工作和生产十分繁忙，到省开会次数多了，会使他们所负任务的完成受到一定的影响。鉴于上述情况，地方各级人民代表大会和地方各级人民委员会组织法第十条关于省、直辖市人民代表大会会议每年举行两次的规定，建议改为每年举行一次，在提请全国人民代表大会对地方各级人民代表大会和地方各级人民委员会组织法进行修改以前，提请全国人民代表大会常务委员会先予批准，以便各省、直辖市遵照执行。
    会议根据周恩来总理提出的建议，决定省、直辖市人民代表大会会议可以每年举行一次。
