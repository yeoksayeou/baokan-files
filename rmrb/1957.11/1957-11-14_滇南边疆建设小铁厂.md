    Small Iron Plant Under Construction in Southern Yunnan Border Region
    The Honghe Hani and Yi Autonomous Region in Yunnan Province is building its first small iron smelting plant. The iron produced by this factory will gradually meet the needs of the various ethnic groups within two years. In the past, the steel needed for various farm tools here was transported from the interior by mules and horses.
    This year is the year with the most industrial construction in the Honghe Hani and Yi Autonomous Region since liberation. The region has completed and is building 21 local small-scale factories and workshops, including wineries, oil presses, and sugar presses, giving it its first batch of small-scale factories and workshops.

    滇南边疆建设小铁厂
    云南省红河哈尼族彝族自治区正在兴建第一座小型炼铁厂。这座工厂生产的铁将在两年内逐步达到满足各族人民的需要。过去，这里各种农具所需的钢铁都是依靠骡马从内地运进的。
    今年是红河哈尼族彝族自治区解放以来工业建设最多的一年。全区建成的和正在兴建的有酿酒、榨油、榨糖等二十一项地方小型工厂和作坊，使这里有了第一批小型工厂和作坊。
