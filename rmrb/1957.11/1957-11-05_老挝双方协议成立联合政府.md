Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, November 4th: The Vientiane radio station broadcast that Lao Kingdom Government Prime Minister Prince Souvanna Phouma and Lao Fighting Forces leader Prince Souphanouvong issued a joint statement on the 2nd, agreeing to form a coalition government with representatives of the Lao Fighting Forces participating by expanding the current Kingdom Government. They also agreed to use the current Kingdom Government's governing program proposed by Prince Souvanna Phouma on August 9th of this year as the coalition government's political program.

The statement said that both sides unanimously agreed that the Lao Patriotic Front is a political organization, and as long as its establishment complies with the Kingdom's laws and current decrees, it can enjoy the same rights and be bound by the same obligations as other political parties legally established in Laos.

The statement said that both sides agreed that before the coalition government obtains the National Assembly's trust, it must formally announce the transfer of Phong Saly and Sam Neua provinces and personnel of the Lao Fighting Forces to the Kingdom Government.

The statement said that the Lao Fighting Forces would hand over their combat supplies to the Kingdom Government.

The statement said that both sides agreed to establish Kingdom administrative institutions in Phong Saly and Sam Neua provinces, incorporating combat personnel and public servants of the Lao Fighting Forces. The detailed rules will be stipulated by the Joint Political Committee and the Joint Military Committee.

The statement said that the Kingdom Government guarantees to incorporate the Lao Fighting Forces into the national army. Within the limits of the national budget, those willing to continue serving will be recruited into the active army. Those willing to retire and return home will be incorporated into the national reserve force. The Kingdom Government guarantees to provide them and their families with all kinds of convenience to return to their homes and seek a livelihood.

The statement said that the Kingdom Government guarantees to appoint qualified public servants of the Lao Fighting Forces to appropriate positions in administrative and technical departments.

The statement said that both sides unanimously agreed that the agreement on the cessation of hostilities signed on October 31, 1956, has been overtaken by the development of the situation, and the situation requires a genuine cessation of hostilities. Both sides will instruct the Joint Military Committee to quickly stipulate new measures to achieve absolute ceasefire.

The statement said that after reaching an agreement on principles, it is necessary to solve relevant specific issues through the current negotiations.

The statement said that both sides will actively help the two joint committees to complete their tasks and hope that the issues currently being negotiated and agreed upon can be realized as soon as possible.
