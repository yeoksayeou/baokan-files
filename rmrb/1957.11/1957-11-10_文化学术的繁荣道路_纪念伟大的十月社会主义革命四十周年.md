    The Road to Prosperity for Culture and Scholarship
    —Commemorating the 40th Anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution
    Chu Tunan
    The great October Socialist Revolution opened a new page in human history, and also began a new road of cultural and academic prosperity.
    Before this, human culture and scholarship, like human productivity, were restricted by class society. Because the tools of writing and knowledge were controlled by a small number of people, culture and scholarship served a minority, providing enjoyment and amusement for a few. They did not receive the full support of the entire society, nor the support and love of the broad masses of the people. Therefore, the genius and wisdom of the people could not be fully utilized, and the normal development of culture and scholarship was restricted. It is understandable, and also inevitable, that the culture and scholarship of capitalist society gradually became paralyzed and anemic, gradually losing their full vitality and creativity. The great victory of the October Socialist Revolution opened a new era in human history, establishing a new society without exploitation of man by man on one-sixth of the world's land. The broad masses of working people began to master their own destiny, began their new lives, and also began to exert their genius and wisdom. Therefore, in the short span of forty years, the great Soviet people not only achieved highly developed at an unprecedented speed in the production of industry and agriculture and in all aspects of social construction, but also achieved extremely brilliant achievements in culture and scholarship. An important indicator of this is the unprecedented popularization and improvement of culture and education in the Soviet Union. At present, the seven-year compulsory education system has been implemented throughout the Soviet Union, both in urban and rural areas, and the ten-year compulsory education system has been basically implemented in major cities. In terms of cultivating specialized talents, the Soviet Union's institutions of higher learning had trained more than 1.12 million specialized talents during the Fifth Five-Year Plan period, and night universities and correspondence universities had also trained more than 260,000 specialized talents. In terms of the publication and circulation of books, such as the types and number of books published, the number of books distributed per capita, the proportion of scientific books in the total number of books published, and the number of libraries of various types throughout the country and the number of books in their collections, the Soviet Union has taken the lead in the world. In the Tsarist era, the Soviet Union was still a culturally backward country with a large number of illiterate people. In the forty years since the October Revolution, the development of culture and education in the Soviet Union has been of such a large scale and speed that it can be said to be unparalleled and impossible in any capitalist country. In terms of science and technology, the Soviet Union was the first country to build an atomic power station and also the first country to successfully complete the intercontinental missiles that can be launched. In the past, various old and new brands of imperialist countries were complacent in thinking that their industrial construction and science and technology could dominate the world. Now, they are distraught at the thought that they are lagging behind the Soviet Union in science and technology. The recent launch of the artificial earth satellite by the Soviet Union is further proof of the prosperity of Soviet science and technology. This also undeniably demonstrates the superiority of the socialist system.
    Of course, this is due to the leadership of the Soviet Communist Party and the construction of a socialist society, which have provided fertile ground for the development of culture and scholarship. At the same time, because Marxism-Leninism has been grasped by the workers, peasants and intellectuals of the Soviet Union, Soviet culture and scholarship have had the correct direction and path for development. This kind of culture and scholarship takes the dialectical materialist world outlook and the revolutionary theory of Marxism-Leninism as its guiding ideology, so it can correctly recognize the objective laws of nature and society, correctly and comprehensively explain nature and society, have scientific foresight, and can point out the ways and methods to conquer nature and transform society. This kind of culture and science is also closely integrated with practice and completely serves the people. Therefore, this kind of culture and science will always have rich, full and healthy vitality and creativity, and is loved and supported by the broad masses of the people. This is the main reason why Soviet culture and scholarship have achieved prosperity and upsurge in the past forty years.
    As early as the beginning of the revolution, Lenin, the great teacher of the socialist revolution, repeatedly emphasized that dialectical materialism is a guide to action and emphasized the creativity of Marxism. After the October Socialist Revolution, Soviet culture and science developed rapidly under the guidance of the revolutionary theory of Marxism-Leninism. Soviet cultural, educational, and scientific workers have also armed themselves with the revolutionary theory of Marxism-Leninism and worked creatively. Therefore, today, forty years later, they have indeed achieved brilliant achievements.
    The victory of our people's revolution and the establishment of New China is a continuation of the October Socialist Revolution and a part of the world proletarian socialist revolution movement. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people's revolution advanced along the road of the October Revolution before it won a complete victory. The glorious path pointed out by the October Socialist Revolution and the advanced experience of Soviet socialist construction will always be our example to learn from. In terms of promoting the culture and scholarship of our country and bringing our science to approach or reach the international level within twelve years, we will also learn from the Soviet Union without exception. This is of decisive significance for promoting our country's socialist cultural construction and promoting the prosperity of our country's culture and scholarship. The rightists refuse to accept the leadership of the Party, refuse to study Marxism-Leninism, resist ideological remolding, and also have various forms of resistance to learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. The essence of this reactionary statement and action is to make the Chinese people deviate from the road of the October Socialist Revolution, destroy the great cause of socialist construction, and return Chinese academic culture to the decadent and declining road of capitalist society. This is absolutely intolerable to the Chinese people. Therefore, while commemorating the October Socialist Revolution, we must deeply understand the great historical and international significance of the October Socialist Revolution and further expose and smash all the conspiracies of the rightists. Defend the road of the October Revolution and defend the fruits of victory of the socialist revolution.
    The historical experience of the Chinese revolution proves that only under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party can the bourgeois revolution be completed and the socialist revolution be realized. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, the broad masses of the Chinese people have been freed from oppression, exploitation, and poverty, their lives have gradually improved, and people of all ethnic groups have united closely and emerged in the world as a free, independent, and peaceful progressive force. This would be impossible without the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. The same is true in the field of culture and scholarship. In the past eight years, the development of cultural and educational undertakings in New China, the expansion of the scientific team, and the gradual improvement of the working and living conditions of academic workers have all achieved extremely brilliant achievements under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. Taking scientific research institutions as an example, compared with 1950 and 1956, the number of research institutions increased from seventeen to sixty-six, funding increased by twenty-two times, and the number of researchers increased by thirteen times. In terms of higher education, the speed of higher education development in our country after liberation is second only to the Soviet Union in the world, and more than twice the average annual development speed of the United States in forty-five years. Compared with old China, the number of new students added each year after liberation is more than six times that of the Kuomintang rule. A total of more than 210,000 graduates from institutions of higher learning in the fifty years before liberation, while in the short eight years after liberation, our institutions of higher learning have trained more than 360,000 graduates. The average annual expenditure on higher education is more than fifteen times that of the Kuomintang period. In addition, the development speed of general cultural undertakings and general education is not only unprecedented in Chinese history, but also unparalleled by any capitalist country. Therefore, we must severely refute all kinds of fallacies that "the Party cannot lead science" and smash all kinds of conspiracies and tricks that resist and oppose the leadership of the Party. Only in this way can we guarantee that Chinese culture and scholarship will have strong leadership and an infinitely bright future.
    The achievements of socialist construction, including the prosperity and progress of socialist culture and scholarship, are inseparable from the ideological guidance of Marxism-Leninism. The Soviet experience proves this. Chinese intellectuals, especially old intellectuals, are generally educated by capitalism and even feudalism, so they must be thoroughly transformed. First of all, they must change their political stand and resolutely take the socialist road. Secondly, they must carry out ideological remolding and learn to master the ideological weapon of Marxism-Leninism. Only in this way can they play a role and make certain useful contributions to socialist culture and scholarship. Rejecting ideological remolding and refusing to study Marxism-Leninism will not only block their own ears and eyes, but may even lose their direction, be incompatible with the socialist environment, and not conform to the interests and demands of the broad masses of the people. Only by seriously carrying out ideological remolding and seriously studying the revolutionary theory of Marxism-Leninism, and arming one's mind with the dialectical materialist world outlook, can one recognize the objectively existing laws of the natural world and human society, continuously progress, and then conquer nature and transform society. At the same time, because one's world outlook has been thoroughly resolved, the issues of whom academic workers serve and how to serve and connect with reality will also be resolved accordingly. A new world outlook can produce new ways of thinking and new work attitudes. This will not only make one's research always rich in lively content and full of infinite hope for the future, but will also make the entire cultural and academic activities of New China move towards the prosperous road of correct development.
    The victory of the great October Socialist Revolution pointed out a new direction for human history and social development. The great achievements of the Soviet Union's forty years of socialist construction have also accumulated incomparably rich and valuable experience for mankind. Today, when the working people of the world are celebrating the 40th anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution, the Chinese people will hold higher the glorious banner of the October Socialist Revolution and march forward on the road of victory! Chinese intellectuals will also receive profound socialist revolutionary education from the great October Revolution and the Soviet Union's forty years of construction experience. We believe that under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, Chinese intellectuals will be educated and tempered in the anti-rightist struggle, and on the basis of winning the anti-rightist struggle, they will surely study Marxism-Leninism with a hundredfold effort, carry out ideological remolding, and shoulder the glorious task of promoting and prospering the new national culture of socialist China, and advance together with the broad masses of workers and peasants in China!

    文化学术的繁荣道路
    ——纪念伟大的十月社会主义革命四十周年
    楚图南
    伟大的十月社会主义革命掀开了人类历史的新的一页，也开始了文化学术昌盛繁荣的新道路。
    在这以前，人类的文化学术也如同人类的生产力一样是受到阶级社会的限制的。由于文字工具和知识被掌握在少数人的手里，文化学术为少数人服务，供少数人享受和消遣，既得不到整个社会的全力支持，也得不到广大人民的拥护和热爱，因而人民的天才和智慧不能充分发挥，文化学术的正常发展受到限制。资本主义社会的文化学术逐渐瘫痪和贫血，逐渐失去了饱满的生活力和创造力，这是可以理解的，而且也是不可避免的。十月社会主义革命的伟大胜利，开辟了人类历史的新纪元，在世界六分之一的土地上建立了没有人剥削人的新社会，广大劳动人民开始掌握了自己的命运，开始了自己的新的生活，也开始发挥了自己的天才和智慧，所以在短短的四十年间，伟大的苏联人民不仅在工农业的生产和社会建设各方面，均以史无前例的速度得到了高度的发展，即在文化学术方面，也获得了极为光辉的成就。在这方面的一个重要的指标，就是苏联的文化教育的空前的普及和提高。现在苏联全境无论城市农村都已经实行了七年制的义务教育，在大城市中已基本上实行了十年制的义务教育。在培养专门人材方面，在第五个五年计划期间苏联的高等学校即已培养了一百一十二万多名专门人材，夜大学和函授大学也培养了二十六万多名专门人材。在书籍的出版和流通方面，如书籍出版的种类和册数，每人平均分配的书籍册数，科学书籍在所有书籍出版总额中的比重，全国各种类型的图书馆的数量及藏书的数量等，苏联皆已跃居于世界的首位。苏联在沙皇时代还是一个文化落后、文盲众多的国家。而在十月革命以后的四十年间，苏联的文化、教育的发展，其巨大的规模和速度，可以说是任何资本主义国家所没有、也不可能有的。在科学技术方面，苏联是第一个建立原子能发电站的国家，也是第一个成功地完成了可以放射洲际导弹的国家。过去各种新旧不同牌号的帝国主义国家，曾经得意忘形的以为他们的工业建设和科学技术可以独霸世界。现在他们已经失魂落魄似的感到在科学技术方面是落在苏联的后面了。最近苏联发射的人造地球卫星，更是苏联科学技术的繁荣的证明。这同时也无可辩驳地说明了社会主义制度的优越性。
    当然，这是由于苏联共产党的领导，社会主义社会的建成，使文化学术有了得以发展的富饶的土壤。同时，由于马克思列宁主义掌握了苏联的工农劳动人民和知识分子，便使苏联的文化学术有了正确发展的方向和道路。这种文化学术是以辩证唯物主义的世界观和马克思列宁主义的革命理论作为指导思想的，因而它可以正确认识自然和社会的客观规律，正确而全面地解释自然和社会，有科学的预见性，可以指出征服自然和改造社会的途径和办法。这种文化科学又是密切地与实际结合的，并且是完全服务于人民的，因此这种文化科学也就永远有着丰富、饱满和健壮的生命力和造创力，为广大人民所热爱和拥护。这便是苏联四十年来文化学术获得繁荣和高涨的主要原因。
    远在革命开始的时期，社会主义革命的伟大导师列宁即一再强调辩证唯物主义是行动的指南，强调马克思主义的创造性。十月社会主义革命以后，苏联的文化科学正是在马克思列宁主义的革命理论的指导下得到迅速的发展的。苏联的文化、教育和科学工作者，也正是以马克思列宁主义的革命理论武装了自己而创造性地工作着。因此，在四十年后的今天，果然获得了光辉灿烂的成就。
    我国人民革命的胜利和新中国的建立是十月社会主义革命的继续，也是全世界无产阶级社会主义革命运动的一部分。中国的人民革命，正是在中国共产党的领导之下，沿着十月革命的道路前进，才获得了彻底的胜利。十月社会主义革命所指出的光辉道路和苏联社会主义建设的先进经验，将永远是我们学习的榜样。在繁荣我国的文化学术、使我国的科学在十二年内接近或达到国际水平方面，我们也将毫不例外地向苏联学习。这对于促进我国的社会主义文化建设，繁荣我国的文化学术，有着决定性的意义。右派分子拒绝接受党的领导，拒绝学习马列主义，抗拒思想改造，对于学习苏联先进经验也发生各种各样不同方式的抵触情绪。这种反动的言论和行动的实质，就是要使中国人民离开十月社会主义革命的道路，破坏社会主义建设的伟大事业，使中国的学术文化回到资本主义社会的腐朽没落的道路。这是中国人民绝不能容忍的。所以在纪念十月社会主义革命的同时，我们必须深刻认识十月社会主义革命的伟大的历史意义和国际意义，进一步揭发和粉碎右派分子的一切阴谋。保卫十月革命的道路，保卫社会主义革命胜利的果实。
    中国革命的历史经验证明，只有在中国共产党的领导下，才能完成资产阶级革命，实现社会主义革命。中华人民共和国成立后，广大的中国人民已经摆脱了压迫、剥削和贫困，生活逐步得到改善，各族人民亲密团结，成为自由独立和和平进步的强大力量出现于世界。这没有中国共产党的领导，是不可能设想的。在文化学术方面也不例外。八年来，新中国文教事业的发达、科学队伍的扩大和学术工作者工作条件、生活条件的逐步改善，也都在中国共产党的领导之下获得了极为光辉的成就。就科学研究机构来说，以1950年和1956年比，研究机构从十七个增加到六十六个，经费增加了二十二倍，研究人员增加了十三倍。以高等教育来说，我国解放以后高等教育发展的速度，在全世界仅次于苏联，而超过美国四十五年间平均每年发展速度的两倍。和旧中国比，解放后每年新增加的学生人数等于国民党统治时期的六倍以上。解放前五十年间的高等学校毕业生共二十一万多人，而解放后的短短八年间，我们的高等学校却培养了三十六万多毕业生。高教经费每年平均支出相当于国民党时期的十五倍以上。此外，一般文化事业和普通教育的发展速度不仅在中国历史上是空前的，并且也是任何资本主义国家所不能比拟的。所以我们必须严厉驳斥“党不能领导科学”的各种谰言，粉碎一切抗拒和反对党的领导的各式各样的阴谋和诡计。这样才能保证中国文化学术有坚强的领导和无限光明的前途。
    社会主义建设事业的获得成就，包括社会主义的文化学术的繁荣和进步在内，是和马克思列宁主义的思想指导分不开的。苏联的经验证明了这一点。中国的知识分子，特别是旧知识分子，一般是受资本主义乃至封建主义的教育，因此必须彻底改造。首先必须改变政治立场，坚决走社会主义的道路。其次必须进行思想改造，学会掌握马克思列宁主义的思想武器。这样才能发挥作用，对社会主义的文化学术作出一定的有益的贡献。拒绝思想改造，拒绝学习马克思列宁主义，不仅闭塞了自己的耳目，甚至会迷失方向，和社会主义的环境不相适应，也不符合广大人民的利益和要求。惟有认真地进行思想改造，认真地学习马克思列宁主义的革命理论，以辩证唯物主义的世界观武装了自己的头脑，才可以认识自然世界和人类社会客观存在的规律，不断地进步，进而征服自然和改造社会。同时由于自己的世界观获得了彻底的解决，也就相应地解决了学术工作者为谁服务以及如何服务和联系实际等问题。新的世界观可以产生新的思想方法和新的工作态度。这样不仅使自己的研究永远富有活泼生动的内容和充满了无限希望的前景，也将使新中国整个文化学术的活动，走向正确发展的昌盛繁荣的道路。
    伟大的十月社会主义革命的胜利，指出了人类历史和社会发展的新的方向。苏联四十年社会主义建设的伟大成就，亦为人类积累了无比丰富的宝贵经验。在全世界劳动人民狂欢庆祝十月社会主义革命四十周年的今天，中国人民将更高地举起十月社会主义革命的光辉旗帜，踏着胜利的道路，迈步前进！中国的知识分子也将从伟大的十月革命和苏联四十年来的建设经验中受到深刻的社会主义的革命教育。我们相信，在中国共产党的领导之下，中国知识分子在反右派斗争中得到教育和锻炼，在反右派斗争获得胜利的基础上，必然能够百倍努力地学习马克思列宁主义，进行思想改造，负担起促进和繁荣中国社会主义的民族的新文化的光荣任务，和中国广大的工农劳动人民一道前进！
