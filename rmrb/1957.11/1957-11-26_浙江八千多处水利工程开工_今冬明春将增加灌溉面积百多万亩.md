    Hangzhou, November 23rd (Report from our newspaper) A large-scale water conservancy construction movement has vigorously unfolded in Zhejiang Province. According to statistics, construction has started in 64 counties across the province, with over 100,000 people working daily. A total of 8,657 various farmland water conservancy projects have commenced, with 54 small reservoirs and 1,755 other water conservancy projects already completed. This winter and spring, Zhejiang Province will mobilize over 112.3 million person-days to complete over 241,300 various water conservancy projects, including 4,879 medium and small reservoirs. After the completion of these projects, the irrigated area will increase by 1.07 million mu, the irrigation area will be improved by 7.3 million mu, and the drainage area will be controlled and improved by 5.1 million mu. In addition, soil erosion control will be achieved on an area of 1,095 square kilometers, and 1,150 kilowatts of hydroelectric power will be generated. In order to accomplish this enormous task, Party organizations at all levels have taken various active measures. Currently, 77 counties across the province have established water conservancy construction headquarters to strengthen leadership over water conservancy work. Seventy counties have convened water conservancy representative meetings, launching extensive airing of views, debates, and discussions on issues such as water conservancy construction and the development of agricultural production relations, clarifying erroneous ideas and enhancing the enthusiasm of the masses for water conservancy construction. After the water conservancy conferences in 13 counties, including Suichang and Lin'an in the Jiande Special Zone, water conservancy committees were established in every township and water conservancy teams were established in every cooperative. In late October, 142 townships began water conservancy construction, and 192 water conservancy projects have now been completed. Currently, 15,000 people are working daily in Lanxi County. All 33 townships in the county have achieved "water conservancy construction in every township and water conservancy construction in every cooperative." In Zhuge Township, nearly 400 women were mobilized to participate in water conservancy construction. Under the slogan "Where there is water, there is grain; reservoirs are granaries," Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members of Jianfeng Cooperative in Yongchang Township led more than 250 cooperative members to work day and night on the construction site, ramming stones, carrying earth, and building dams, enabling the township's reservoir to be completed two days ahead of schedule.
    In the process of water conservancy construction, Zhejiang Province is not only educating farmers about the significance of water conservancy construction and increasing grain production through organized visits and tours but also training a large number of farmer water conservancy technicians. Currently, over 50 counties across the province have organized more than 3,000 cadres and masses to visit Tongshan Township in Zhuji, Tangdi Township in Shaoxing, and Pengling Township in Wenling, where agricultural abundance has been achieved due to well-constructed water conservancy facilities. Twenty-three counties, including Dongyang, Yongjia, Haining, and Deqing, have held water conservancy training classes, training a total of 3,200 farmer technicians.

    浙江八千多处水利工程开工
    今冬明春将增加灌溉面积百多万亩
    本报杭州23日电　规模宏大的兴修水利运动，已经在浙江省蓬勃展开。据统计，全省已有六十四个县开工，每天出工有十多万人，共开工各种农田水利工程八千六百五十七处，已完成五十四处小型水库和一千七百五十五处其他水利工程。在今冬明春浙江省将出动一亿一千二百三十多万个人工，完成各种水利工程二十四万一千三百多处，其中有中、小型水库四千八百七十九处。完成这些工程后，可增加灌溉面积一百零七万亩，改善灌溉面积七百三十万亩，控制和改善排水面积五百一十万亩；此外，还能控制水土流失面积一千零九十五平方公里，水力发电一千一百五十瓩。为了完成这项巨大任务，各地党组织采取了各种积极措施。现在全省有七十七个县建立了兴修水利指挥部，加强了对水利工作的领导。有七十个县召开了水利代表会，就兴修水利和发展农业生产关系等问题展开了大放、大鸣、大辩论，澄清了错误思想，提高了群众兴修水利的积极性。建德专区遂安、临安等十三个县水利会议后，乡乡成立水利委员会，社社建立水利小组。10月下旬，有一百四十二个乡开始兴修水利，现在已完成一百九十二处水利工程。兰溪县现在每天有一万五千人出工，全县三十三个乡，已做到“乡乡修水利，社社修水利”，该县诸葛乡还动员了近四百妇女参加了修水利。永昌乡建丰社的共产党员和共青团员在“有水就有粮、水库是粮仓”的口号下，带领二百五十多个社员星夜在工地上赶打石夯、挑土、筑坝，使该乡水库提早两天完成。
    浙江省在兴修水利中，一面通过组织参观、访问，教育农民兴修水利和增产粮食的意义，一面还训练了大批农民水利技术员。现在全省有五十多个县组织了三千多名干部、群众先后到诸暨同山乡、绍兴棠棣乡，温岭彭岭乡等地参观、访问，这些先进地区都是由于修好水利而获得了农业丰产。东阳、永嘉、海宁、德清等二十三个县举办了水利训练班，共训练出农民技术员三千二百名。
