Xinhua News Agency, November 11th: More than one-eighth of the nation's cotton-producing counties and cities have achieved average cotton yields of 40, 60, 80, and 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu, respectively. The cotton fields in these counties and cities account for approximately 30% of the nation's total cotton field area.

According to preliminary statistics from the National Cotton Production Work Conference, over 9 million mu (more than one-tenth of the nation's cotton field area) of cotton fields across the country have an average yield of over 80 jin of ginned cotton per mu this year. Among them, approximately 3.5 million mu, accounting for about 4% of the nation's cotton field area, have an average yield exceeding 100 jin per mu. Agricultural production cooperatives achieving 100 jin or 80 jin of ginned cotton per mu are even more widespread across the country in various regions.

According to highly incomplete statistics from the National Cotton Production Work Conference, among the more than 1,300 cotton-producing counties (cities) nationwide, 179 counties and cities have achieved an average cotton yield of over 40 jin per mu this year. Among them, five counties and cities have an average yield exceeding 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu (previously reported as four): Cixi County in Zhejiang (105 jin), Macheng County (103 jin) and Guangji County (100 jin) in Hubei, Dunhuang County in Gansu (105 jin), and Shijiazhuang City in Hebei (101 jin). Six counties have an average yield between 80 and 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu: Huangmei County (90 jin) and Xishui County (82 jin) in Hubei Province, Shanshan County (84 jin) and Turpan County (82.5 jin) in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, Chongren County (85 jin) in Jiangxi Province, and Baixiang County (80 jin) in Hebei Province. Forty counties (cities) have an average yield between 60 and 80 jin of ginned cotton per mu, including ten in Hubei Province, six in Anhui Province, five in Jiangxi Province, four each in Hebei, Shandong, and Jiangsu Provinces, three in Shaanxi Province, two in Xinjiang, and one in Henan, plus Shanghai Municipality (suburbs). One hundred and twenty-eight counties (cities) have an average yield between 40 and 60 jin of ginned cotton per mu, including thirty-eight in Xinjiang, fourteen each in Shanxi and Shaanxi, ten each in Henan, Jiangxi, and Liaoning, eight each in Shandong and Hunan, seven in Hubei, four in Anhui, three in Sichuan, and one in Gansu, plus Beijing Municipality (suburbs). The average cotton yield per mu in Zhejiang Province this year has exceeded 60 jin, and there are also many counties and cities in Hebei Province with average yields per mu between 40 and 60 jin, but they are not included in the above-mentioned 179 counties and cities due to a lack of detailed statistics. In addition, the average cotton yield per mu in Hebei, Hubei, Shaanxi, Xinjiang, and Gansu provinces/regions has also reached between 40 and 60 jin.

The above situation indicates that in various regions of our country, there are conditions for achieving increased cotton production and bumper harvests. (Photo attached)

    全国三分之一棉田增产
    产棉区都有条件达到农业发展纲要的指标
    据新华社11日讯　全国八分之一以上的产棉县、市今年棉花每亩平均产量，分别达到了四十斤、六十斤、八十斤、一百斤皮棉的水平。这些县、市的棉田占全国棉田总面积30％左右。
    全国棉产工作会议根据初步掌握的材料统计：今年全国有九百万亩以上（占全国棉田面积十分之一多）的棉田平均每亩产皮棉八十斤以上，其中有约占全国棉田面积4％的三百五十多万亩平均每亩产量超过了一百斤。每亩产百斤皮棉、八十斤皮棉的农业生产合作社，更遍布在全国各种不同的地区。
    据全国棉产工作会议极不完全的统计，全国一千三百多个产棉县
  （市）中，今年有一百七十九个县、市的棉花每亩平均产量达到了四十斤以上。其中，每亩平均产量超过一百斤皮棉的有五个县、市（前报道为四个），它们是浙江的慈溪县（一百零五斤），湖北的麻城县（一百零三斤）、广济县（一百斤），甘肃的敦煌县（一百零五斤），河北的石家庄市（一百零一斤）；每亩平均产量在一百斤以下八十斤以上的有六个县，它们是湖北省的黄梅县（九十斤）、浠水县（八十二斤），新疆维吾尔自治区的鄯善县（八十四斤）、吐鲁番县（八十二点五斤），江西省的崇仁县（八十五斤），河北省的柏乡县（八十斤）；每亩平均产量在八十斤以下六十斤以上的有四十个县（市），其中湖北省十个，安徽省六个，江西省五个，河北、山东、江苏等省各四个，陕西省三个，新疆两个，河南省一个，另外还有一个上海市（郊区）；每亩平均产量在六十斤以下四十斤以上的有一百二十八个县（市），其中新疆三十八个，山西、陕西各十四个，河南、江西、辽宁各十个，山东、湖南各八个，湖北七个，安徽四个，四川三个，甘肃一个，另外还有北京市（郊区）。浙江省今年棉花每亩平均产量已超过了六十斤，河北省也有很多平均亩产量在六十斤以下四十斤以上的县、市，因没有详细统计，都没有计算在上述一百七十九个县、市中。另外，河北、湖北、陕西、新疆、甘肃等五省区的每亩棉花平均产量，也都达到了六十斤以下四十斤以上。
    以上情况说明，在我国各地，种植棉花都有条件获得增产丰收。（附图片）
