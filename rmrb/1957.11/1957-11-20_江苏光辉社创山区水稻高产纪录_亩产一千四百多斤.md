Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, November 17th: The Guanghui Seventh Agricultural Cooperative in Tingzi Township, Jurong County, Jiangsu Province, harvested 1,490 jin of rice from one mu and five li of land, averaging 1,419 jin per mu, creating a high-yield record for rice production per unit area in mountainous regions.

	This high-yield field was meticulously cultivated by cooperative members under the leadership of Nie Changhuai, the captain of the Second Production Team of the agricultural cooperative. After soil improvement, this field had fertile soil, sufficient fertilizer, was deeply ploughed three times, and weeded four times. The variety planted was the Huangke Zao 20-Ri Japonica rice, a superior variety. This year, Guanghui Seventh Cooperative had 29 mu of rice fields yielding over 1,000 jin. The average yield of rice for the entire cooperative, covering 1,030 mu, was over 510 jin per mu, an increase of more than 20% compared to last year. With the increase in high-yield fields, Guanghui Seventh Cooperative plans to expand the area of dry land converted to paddy fields and indica rice converted to japonica rice, striving to achieve an average rice yield of over 900 jin per mu next year.

    江苏光辉社创山区水稻高产纪录
    亩产一千四百多斤
    新华社南京17日电　江苏句容县亭子乡光辉第七农业社，有一亩零五厘田收获水稻一千四百九十斤，平均每亩产量一千四百一十九斤，创造了山区水稻单位面积产量的高额纪录。
    这块高产田是这个农业社的第二生产队队长聂昌怀领导社员精心培植的。这块田改良土壤后土质肥沃，肥料足，深耕三次，锄草四次，种植的是黄壳早二十日粳稻良种。光辉七社今年出现了二十九亩水稻千斤田。全社一千零三十亩水稻平均每亩产量五百一十多斤，比去年增产20％以上。在高产田增多的情况下，光辉七社计划扩大旱田改水田和籼稻改粳稻的面积，争取明年每亩水稻产量平均达到九百多斤。
