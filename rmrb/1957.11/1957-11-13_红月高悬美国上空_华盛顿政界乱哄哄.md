    Red Moon Hangs High Over America
    Washington Political Circles in Chaos
    Xinhua News Agency, Washington, November 12th: American political figures, with a sense of panic, continue to argue about the Soviet Union's launch of two artificial satellites. They each put forward what they believe are the reasons for America's backwardness and demand that emergency measures be taken.
    Truman said on the evening of the 10th that the Soviet Union's launch of artificial satellites was "a major event" because the United States had fallen behind "in areas where it should not have fallen behind." He also gave a speech at the Veterans Day celebration in Wiert, West Virginia, on the 11th, saying that one of the reasons for the United States' backwardness in the artificial satellite program was that some "character assassins" had driven many important scientists out of government service. These people "used slander (rather than evidence), accusations, and obvious lies to try to create fear and doubt among us... They launched fierce attacks on American scientists who were studying the peaceful use of atomic energy. These scientists were subjected to such great humiliation that the U.S. government lost a great many of them."
    Former Democratic presidential candidate Stevenson said that the Soviet Union's launch of artificial satellites made it necessary for people to choose between destruction and international peaceful coexistence. He said that a nova passed through the sky last month. He had hoped that the United States would ignite this nova, but it didn't, and he was "very disturbed" by this. Stevenson demanded a reformulation of policy. He said that the appearance of artificial satellites required the United States to make "meaningful and creative responses," but the proposals he put forward were still primarily to "reorganize America's military alliances" and "reorganize and re-examine America's military strength," etc.

    红月高悬美国上空
    华盛顿政界乱哄哄
    据新华社12日讯　华盛顿消息：美国政界人士带着惊慌的情绪继续在对苏联发射两颗人造卫星一事吵吵嚷嚷。他们各自提出他们认为美国落后的原因，并且要求采取紧急措施。
    杜鲁门10日晚上说，苏联发射人造卫星是“一件大事”，因为美国已经在“不应该落后的地方落后了”。他在11日又在西弗吉尼亚州威尔特复员军人日庆祝会上发表演讲说，美国在人造卫星计划方面落后的原因之一是由于有一些“扼杀性格的人”把许多重要的科学家赶出了为政府服务的岗位，这些人“使用诬蔑（而不是证据）、控告和显而易见的谎言来设法在我们中间制造恐惧和疑虑……他们对那些研究和平利用原子能的美国科学家进行猛烈的攻击。这些科学家遭到了这样大的凌辱，以至美国政府损失了许许多多这样的科学家”。
    前民主党总统候选人史蒂文森说，苏联发射人造卫星使得人们必须在毁灭和国际和睦共处之间作一选择。他说，上个月一颗新星在天空掠过。他本来希望燃起这颗新星的是美国，结果并不是，他对此“大为不安”，史蒂文森要求重新制订政策。他说，人造卫星的出现要求美国作出“有意义的和创造性的反应”，但是他提出的主张却仍然首先是“改组美国的军事联盟”、“改组和重新审查美国的军事力量”等。
