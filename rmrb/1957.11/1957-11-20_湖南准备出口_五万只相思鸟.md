Hunan Prepares to Export
    50,000 Leiothrix Lutea (Red-billed Leiothrix)
    The peak season for catching Leiothrix Lutea has arrived just after the Beginning of Winter. Farmers in various parts of Hunan Province plan to capture 50,000 Leiothrix Lutea this year for export, and 30,000 have already been caught. Before dawn each day, in the areas where Leiothrix Lutea are produced—the Bamianshan Mountain in Guidong, Hunan Province, and the Mufu Mountain in Pingjiang and Liuyang—many agricultural cooperative members enter the dense forests to catch birds.
    The Leiothrix Lutea is slightly smaller than a sparrow, with a red beak, beautiful plumage, and a clear, melodious song. Usually, they live in caves and feed on the seeds of wild plants. In winter, they forage in groups. This bird is a very precious gift in Western countries and the South Pacific islands. When young people get married, their relatives and friends always buy a pair in exquisite small cages to send as congratulations for their loving relationship. In the past, this bird did not attract much attention. Last year, after the China Export Company discovered this bird in Guidong and other places, it entrusted the local supply and marketing cooperatives to purchase more than 20,000 birds and ship them abroad.

    湖南准备出口
    五万只相思鸟
    立冬刚过，捕捉相思鸟的旺季就到来了。湖南各地农民今年要捕捉相思鸟五万只，运销国外，现已捕到三万只。每天东方还未发白，在相思鸟的产地——湖南省桂东的八面山以及平江、浏阳的幕阜山等山地，就有许多农业社员进入茂密的树林里捕鸟。
    相思鸟形体比麻雀略小，红嘴，毛色美丽，有着清脆动人的歌喉，平时，住在岩洞里，靠吃野生植物的种子生活，冬天就成群结队地四出觅食。这种鸟在西方国家和南洋群岛等地是一种非常珍贵的礼品，当地年轻人结婚时，他们的亲友总要买上一对装在精致的小笼里送去，祝贺他们相亲相爱。从前，这种鸟没有引起人们注意。去年，中国出口公司在桂东等地发现这种鸟后，曾委托当地供销合作社代购两万多只，运往国外。 （新华社）（附图片）
