A person in charge of the First Ministry of Machine Building told reporters: In order to support agricultural production, the First Ministry of Machine Building will organize a group of factories to trial-produce and produce simple rice harvesters, paddy field tillage machines, power threshers, swamp double-furrow plows, ridging cultivators, small grain combine harvesters, cotton pickers, electric wool shears, small tractors, and coal gas powered trucks with a load capacity of half a ton to one ton, as well as other agricultural machinery power and mechanical tools.

Xinhua News Agency, November 24th: The National Agricultural Machinery Conference, jointly convened by the State Economic Commission, the First Ministry of Machine Building, and other relevant departments, will be held in Beijing on December 2nd. This conference will study the specific needs of the upcoming new high tide of agricultural production for agricultural (including water conservancy) machinery, the production arrangements and promotion and use of agricultural machinery, etc. This was stated by a person in charge of the First Ministry of Machine Building.

In order to implement the policy proposed by the Central Committee of the Communist Part of China of developing industry and developing agriculture simultaneously on the basis of prioritizing the development of heavy industry, what work is the First Ministry of Machine Building doing to support the development of agricultural production? What measures will be taken? This person in charge spoke about these issues at the request of Xinhua News Agency reporters. Reporters from the People's Daily, Ta Kung Pao, and the Central People's Broadcasting Station also participated in the conversation.

The person in charge said that before the Third Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, we had already sent a group of cadres and technicians to the countryside to investigate agricultural machinery issues. Later, we held some meetings with agricultural and water conservancy departments to conduct some research on the issue of agricultural mechanization in our country. We are also preparing to continue in-depth investigations into relevant aspects.

The person in charge said that from what we have already learned, we can draw the following conclusion: the need for agricultural machinery in the Chinese countryside after cooperation is urgent. The main way to increase agricultural production in our country is to increase the yield per unit area. This means changing from one crop per season to multiple crops, changing dry land to paddy fields, applying more fertilizer, and intensive cultivation, etc. These all require a lot of manpower and animal power. In particular, increasing the multiple cropping index, the shortage of human and animal power during busy farming seasons has become a common problem hindering increased production in rural areas. Therefore, there is an urgent need for the help of mechanical power and mechanical tools. Agricultural machinery can increase production as long as it is used properly, and the economic effect is also good. However, the characteristics of our country must also be considered when determining agricultural machinery for our country. China's terrain and soil are different, and the cultivation techniques in various places are also different. In terms of power resources, China lacks oil. How to make the best use of our abundant coal, water, and other natural power sources is also a problem that must be paid attention to.

The person in charge said that we have combined these characteristics of China's agriculture and done some experimental research work on agricultural machinery. In terms of power machinery, we have found more possibilities for utilizing natural power resources other than oil. The De Te-54 type tractor that has been converted to burn coal gas has been successfully tested. A factory in Tianjin recently converted a gasoline engine into a gas engine, and the experimental effect was also very good. We will also experiment and study rural power machinery that utilizes water power and wind power.

According to the preliminary plan, the First Ministry of Machine Building will organize a group of state-owned and local state-owned agricultural machinery factories next year to trial-produce thirty-eight kinds of agricultural machinery. These agricultural machinery include simple rice harvesters, paddy field tillage machines, and power threshers for the southern paddy field areas; swamp double-furrow plows, ridging cultivators, and small grain combine harvesters adapted to the soil characteristics and ridging requirements of the Northeast; cotton pickers, sisal hemp, and lemongrass harvesters for cash crop areas; and hay rakes, electric wool shears, and milking machines for pastoral areas. Among the agricultural machines to be trial-produced by this ministry next year, there are also seven types of tractors for various agricultural uses, ranging in size from one hundred horsepower to six horsepower, one of which, with fifty-four horsepower, will begin small-batch production next year. In order to solve the problem of rural transportation machinery, we will also study and trial-produce coal gas-powered rural vehicles with a load capacity of half a ton and one ton next year, and require it to be equivalent to the price of two mules and a large cart.

The person in charge said that actively supporting the current water conservancy movement in various places is an important task for us. After the rectification and socialist education movement, the vast number of farmers have a high enthusiasm for production. Canals are being dug and wells are being drilled everywhere in the countryside, and the number of power machinery for drainage and irrigation needed is very large, changing every day. We must try our best to meet this need, but we must also pay attention to preventing blindness.

The person in charge also said that the upcoming National Agricultural Machinery Conference is very important. The conference will also discuss the national plan for agricultural machinery manufacturing and repair in my country during the second five-year plan.

    大力生产适合我国需要的农业机械
    第一机械工业部负责人对记者说：为了支援农业生产，第一机械工业部将组织一批工厂，试制和生产简易水稻收割机、水田耕作机、动力脱粒机、沼泽地双铧犁、垅作中耕培土机、小型谷物联合收割机、摘棉机、羊毛电剪、小型拖拉机以及载重半吨到一吨的烧煤气的汽车等农业机械动力和机械工具。
    据新华社24日讯　由国家经济委员会同第一机械工业部及其他有关部门联合召开的全国农业机械会议，将在12月2日在北京举行。这次会议将研究即将到来的农业生产新高潮对于农业（包括水利）机械的具体需要，农业机械的生产安排和推广使用等问题。这是第一机械工业部一位负责人说的。
    为了贯彻执行中共中央提出的在优先发展重工业的基础上，发展工业和发展农业同时并举的方针，第一机械工业部为支援发展农业生产，正在做些什么工作？将要采取哪些措施？这位负责人应新华社记者的要求谈到了这些问题。参加这次谈话的还有人民日报、大公报和中央人民广播电台的记者。
    负责人说，在中共八届三中全会以前，我们就开始派一批干部和技术人员下乡调查农业机械的问题，以后我们又同农业、水利部门开了一些会，对我国农业机械化的问题作了一些研究。我们还准备继续深入调查有关这方面的情况。
    这位负责人说，从我们已经了解到的情况可以得出这样的认识：合作化后的中国农村对农业机械的需要是迫切的。我国农业增产的主要途径是提高单位面积产量。这就是要改一季为多季，变旱田为水田，多施肥料，精耕细作等等。这些都需要很多的人力和畜力。特别是提高复种指数，在农忙时人畜力不足已经成为农村中妨碍增产的一个普遍问题。因此，迫切需要机械动力和机械工具的帮助。农业机械只要使用得当是可以增产的，经济效果也是好的。但是在确定我国的农业机械时还必须考虑我国的特点。中国的地形和土壤各不相同，各地的耕种技术也不一样，在动力资源方面，中国缺乏石油，如何尽量利用我们丰富的煤、水等天然动力，也是一个必须注意的问题。
    负责人说，我们已经结合我国农业的这些特点，对农业机械做了一些试验研究工作。在动力机械方面，我们已找到了利用石油以外的其他天然动力资源的更多的可能性。改烧煤气的德特—五四型的拖拉机，已经试验成功。天津一个工厂最近将汽油机改成煤气机，试验的效果也很好。我们还要试验研究利用水力、风力的农村动力机械。
    按照初步确定的计划，第一机械工业部明年将组织一批国营和地方国营农业机械厂试制三十八种农业机械。这些农业机械有供南方水田地区用的简易水稻收割机、水田耕作机和动力脱粒机；有适应东北土壤特点和垅作要求而制的沼泽地双铧犁、垅作中耕培土机、小型谷物联合收割机；有供经济作物区用的摘棉机，剑麻、香茅收割机；还有供牧区用的搂草机、羊毛电剪和挤奶器等。这个部明年试制的农业用的机器中，还有大到一百个马力小到六个马力的供各种农业用的七种形式的拖拉机，其中一种五十四个马力的明年将开始小批生产。为了解决农村的运输机械问题，明年还要研究试制载重半吨和一吨的烧煤气的农村汽车，并要求它只相当于两头骡子和一辆大车的价格。
    负责人说，积极支援当前各地的水利运动是我们的一项重要工作。广大的农民经过整风和社会主义教育运动，生产的热情很高，农村中到处开河、打井，需要排涝、灌溉用的动力机械数量很大，一天一个样。我们一定要尽量满足这个需要，但是也要注意防止盲目性。
    负责人又说，即将举行的全国农业机械会议很重要。会议还将讨论第二个五年计划我国农业机械制造和修配的全国规划。
