Editor's Note: China's first Five-Year Plan is about to be successfully completed. In the five years of practice, we have gained many valuable experiences and lessons. Conscientiously summarizing these experiences and lessons is of great significance for us to formulate and implement the second Five-Year Plan. For this reason, we have opened up such a column, welcoming everyone to study and discuss all aspects of production and construction work during the first Five-Year Plan.

(I)

China's industry is divided into central industry and local industry according to the management system. Central industry refers to industrial enterprises directly under the central industrial departments and non-industrial departments. As a result of the implementation of the first Five-Year Plan, calculated according to the estimated output value in 1957, the proportion of this part of industry in the national industry (including handicrafts, the same below) has increased from 31.8% in 1952 to 46.2%. Central industry is mainly the means of production industry. Calculated according to the estimated output value in 1957, central industry accounts for about 60% of the output value of the national means of production industry. Whether these enterprises are existing or newly built, they are large and medium-sized enterprises that the country urgently needs, are most basic to the national economy, and are relatively technically complex. The industry producing consumer goods in the central industry also accounts for a significant proportion of the national industry. Their output value in 1957 accounts for about one-third of the national consumer goods industry output value. Among them are mainly the larger-scale and newer-equipped textile and food industries. It can be seen that central industry is the backbone of China's industry and an important material foundation for China's implementation of socialist industrialization.

Local industry is industrial enterprises managed by various provinces and cities. They are in the tens of thousands, scattered throughout the country, mainly small and medium-sized enterprises. Over the past five years, due to the influence of various factors, the proportion of local industrial output value in the national industrial output value has decreased from 68.2% in 1952 to 53.8%, but their absolute value has increased by about 64%. The production of consumer goods occupies a major position in local industry. Calculated according to the estimated output value in 1957, local industry produces about two-thirds of the output value of the national consumer goods industry. It can be seen that local industry occupies an important position in the national industry, and in the consumer goods industry, they have particularly significant role.

Central industry and local industry are interdependent, complementary, and mutually promoting. Together, they form a whole of China's socialist industry. They must be combined with each other.

Specifically, in what aspects is it necessary to combine central industry with local industry?

As everyone knows, one of the characteristics of modern industry is the need for close cooperation. Central industry is only a number of technically complex enterprises that play a leading role in the national economy, but their production requires the cooperation of many technically simpler local industrial enterprises. For example, a car is assembled from more than 3,000 parts and components, and many of the parts needed by the Changchun Automobile Factory are supplied by local machinery factories. Some of the iron ore and pig iron needed by some large steel plants are also supplied by local industrial enterprises. Asbestos, sulfur, mica, graphite, rosin, special-shaped small steel products, as well as bricks, tiles, lime, etc., needed by central industrial enterprises in various places for production and construction, are also all or mostly supplied by local industrial enterprises. As for the routine work of supplementing equipment accessories and repairing machinery and equipment for central industrial enterprises in various places, they are also often inseparable from local industry.

As everyone also knows, China has a vast territory with countless dispersed resources, and at the same time, there are diverse needs with local characteristics in production and life in various places. Central industry only utilizes large and concentrated resources and only pays attention to the production of key products. Then, the responsibility of utilizing dispersed resources in various places and meeting the diverse needs of various places must be borne by local industry.

In addition, after these years of construction, local industry has developed greatly and cultivated a group of technical forces. Local industry has successfully trial-produced many products such as fiberglass, cellophane, photosensitive paper, certain special plastics, precision instruments, and chemical raw materials. These technical forces are indispensable and powerful assistants in the production of central industry.

(II)

In terms of the combination of central industry and local industry, we have done a lot of work in the past and achieved considerable results, but there are also some shortcomings. This is mainly manifested in: a lack of sufficient estimation of the role and potential of local industry; a lack of careful and meticulous arrangements for certain departments and enterprises; and the existence of a "self-sufficiency" mentality in certain central departments and enterprises. Due to the existence of these shortcomings, certain inappropriate phenomena have occurred in the distribution of raw materials and production tasks between central industry and local industry, and between local industries in various provinces and cities. For example, insufficient estimates of the need for local small coal mines and native paper production in a certain period, and excessive compression, are one of the reasons for the emergence of supply shortages. There have also been phenomena of repeated waste of construction resources. For example, in some areas, the central government and local governments have successively built some sugar factories, but due to insufficient raw materials, neither can give full play to the equipment capacity, or some factories need to be relocated; another example is that in some areas, the local machinery repair capacity is already more than sufficient, but newly built central enterprises in the area still have to build their own machinery repair workshops. There have also been phenomena of encouraging local industry to trial-produce or increase production when needed, and then abandoning it when there is a surplus. For example, drilling machinery was felt to be insufficient in a certain period, and some local machinery factories were organized to trial-produce and produce in relatively large quantities, but when there was a surplus, they were asked to shift to producing other products. These shortcomings, to a certain extent, hinder the enthusiasm of local industry and also waste some of the country's construction funds. Of course, these shortcomings also exist to varying degrees among central industrial enterprises. It should be pointed out that insufficient overall planning is not in line with the requirements of China's planned economy; and the "do not ask anyone for anything" mentality is a reflection of the backward self-sufficient economic era. On the other hand, due to the lack of close ties between local industry and central industry and between local industries in various provinces and cities, there have also been some phenomena of blind development. For example, some provinces and cities have a surplus of construction hardware materials and plumbing equipment, while other provinces and cities are carrying out new construction and expansion; the national pharmaceutical equipment for processing raw materials originally had a surplus, but some provinces and cities have also carried out new construction and expansion. This has also increased some difficulties in the national overall planning and is also not in line with the requirements of the planned economy.

Chairman Mao pointed out in his speech "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" that China's path to industrialization "takes heavy industry as the center" and at the same time, "must pay full attention to the development of agriculture and light industry." Therefore, both central industry and local industry need to devote considerable energy to paying attention to organizing and developing the production of industries such as fertilizers, pesticides, and agricultural machinery to support the development of agriculture; they also need to pay attention to developing industrial production that can replace agricultural raw materials and the comprehensive utilization of agricultural raw materials to reduce the pressure on agriculture due to the continuous expansion of production and needs. The work of resource exploration, technical testing, equipment supply, and production cooperation in these aspects also requires the closest cooperation between central industry and local industry, thereby further enriching the content of the combination of the two.

In response to these situations, how should we improve the combination between central industry and local industry during the second Five-Year Plan? I think we should mainly pay attention to the following points.

First, we should strengthen the product balance work mainly led by the central industrial departments, so that the supply, production, and sales of products and the new construction and expansion plans of enterprises can be included in the balance calculation to ensure that central industry and local industry are connected to each other and coordinated with each other in these aspects. When dealing with the balance work, we need to pay attention to making central industry and local industry do their best and use their strengths; making the surplus and deficiency of the production capacity of each enterprise mutually adjusted; and at the same time, pay attention to combining the present and the future, so as to adjust production according to the different situations of agricultural harvests and raw material surpluses and deficiencies each year. The planning and management work should not be too rigid or too broad, and local governments and enterprises should have certain powers so that they can better complete the national plan by adapting to local conditions and taking advantage of the time, without violating the principle of national balance.

Second, it is necessary to appropriately change the current industrial management system. The new management system should adapt to the situation that newly built enterprises in the central industry are successively put into production and the task of building factories during the second Five-Year Plan is more arduous, and transfer some enterprises in the central industry that are not very technically complex, not very large in scale, or whose raw materials are mainly taken from the local area and whose products are mainly supplied to the local area to local management. This can both strengthen the backbone force for the further development of local industry and enable these devolved enterprises to better obtain the leadership and support of local party and government, and better play their role. The new management system should also give local governments and enterprises more financial power than they currently have, in order to help improve their enthusiasm and enable them to have relatively sufficient funds to actively plan for development production in accordance with the resources and technical conditions of the local area and their own enterprises. The new management system also needs to give local governments more powers than they currently have to strengthen the guidance and supervision of local central industrial enterprises, so that local governments can timely discover and solve the problems existing in the cooperation between local central industry and local industry.

Third, gradually adjust the more specific division of labor and cooperation relationship between central industry and local industry. On the one hand, this division of labor and cooperation relationship should enable central industry to truly concentrate its efforts on undertaking the increasingly arduous task of establishing the backbone force of industrialization, and on the other hand, it should enable local industry to more specifically clarify the future direction of efforts under the requirements of serving the rural economy and serving national construction and large-scale industry, so that local governments can unified planning and control of local industrial construction. Therefore, in addition to the various medium-sized and small-scale light and heavy industries that meet local needs should continue to be held by local governments, general light industries that are universally needed throughout the country should also be under local management. Although heavy industry is needed throughout the country, mining, rough refining, general-purpose medium-sized and small-sized machinery, and certain non-standard equipment accessories and parts manufacturing industries that are not technically complex, not large in scale, and suitable for local management should also be transferred to local development as much as possible without hindering the reasonable operation of central industry and without hindering product quality. Local governments should also be encouraged to develop industrial raw materials and fuels, such as various chemical raw material industries and coal, that are in short supply from certain central industries, as long as the local government has the conditions. The utilization of waste materials from local central industrial enterprises should be organized by local governments. Of course, this division of labor is not mechanical.

Fourth, the existing strength of local industry should be given reasonable utilization. For some local industrial enterprises with better technical conditions, central industry should also combine its own needs, or entrust it with the trial and trial production of new products, or use its original foundation to assist it in renovation and expansion. The auxiliary workshops such as machinery repair and carpentry in newly built central industrial enterprises should pay attention to fully utilizing the existing strength of local industry and minimize or not build them.

(III)

During the second Five-Year Plan, local industry will have further development due to the country's greater attention than before to the development of agriculture and the gradual improvement of people's lives, which is completely in line with the country's interests. However, in order to prevent the blindness that may occur in the development process of local industry, local industry should also pay attention to placing its own development on the basis of national balance. That is to say, all production and sales relationships that need to be nationally balanced must be subject to the national balance, avoiding the phenomenon of production shrinkage or the inability to reasonably utilize equipment in other provinces and cities due to their own development, disrupting the principle of national overall planning. For products that are produced and sold within the province, the balance work within the province should also be strengthened based on this principle.

In new construction and expansion projects, attention should be paid to preventing the one-sided practice of being greedy for large and new things. The important advantages of local industry are precisely that it is smaller in scale, less in investment, and faster to put into production, so it can fully utilize scattered resources, can meet needs in a timely manner, and can reduce the pressure on the country's transportation arteries for long-distance transportation of large quantities of materials. If it unilaterally pursues large scale or the latest technology, it will be difficult to maintain these advantages.

When formulating development plans, local industry should also carefully consider the possibility of funding, technology, and equipment supply, and should not only proceed from needs. During the entire transitional stage of socialist construction, the failure of production to fully meet needs will be a relatively common phenomenon. It is impossible to imagine solving all the problems in national construction and people's lives in a short period of time. Therefore, it is necessary to weigh the importance and urgency of needs and carry out construction in an orderly manner, so as to avoid the plan failing or the accumulation of use being too dispersed.

    中央工业要和地方工业相结合
    海鸥
    编者按：我国第一个五年计划就要胜利完成了。在五年的实践当中，我们获得了许多宝贵的经验和教训。认真总结这些经验和教训，对于我们编制和执行第二个五年计划都有很大意义。为此，我们辟了这样一个专栏，欢迎大家对第一个五年计划期间生产和建设工作的各个方面进行研究和探讨。
    （一）
    我国工业按管理系统划分，分为中央工业和地方工业。中央工业是指中央各工业部门及非工业部门所直属的工业企业。第一个五年计划执行的结果，按1957年预计的产值计算，这一部分工业在全国工业（包括手工业，下同）中的比重，已经由1952年的31．8％上升为46．2％。中央工业中，主要是生产资料工业。按1957年预计的产值计算，在全国生产资料工业的产值中，中央工业占60％左右。这些企业不论是原有的或新建的，都是国家所迫切需要的、国民经济中最基本的和技术比较复杂的大、中型企业。中央工业中生产消费资料的工业，在全国工业中也占着不小的比重，它们1957年的产值，约占全国消费资料工业产值的三分之一左右。其中主要是规模较大、设备较新的纺织工业和食品工业。由此可见，中央工业是我国工业的骨干，是我国实行社会主义工业化的重要物质基础。
    地方工业是由各省、市管理的工业企业。它们数以万计，散布于全国各地，其中主要是中、小型的企业。五年以来，地方工业产值在全国工业中的比重，由于各种条件的影响，由1952年的68．2％下降为53．8％，但是它们的绝对值增长了64％左右。消费资料的生产在地方工业中占着主要的地位。按1957年预计产值计算，在全国消费资料工业的产值中，地方工业所生产的约占三分之二。可见地方工业在全国工业中占有重要地位，在消费资料的工业中，它们尤其具有重大的作用。
    中央工业和地方工业既相互依赖，又相互补充，也相互促进。它们共同形成为我国社会主义工业的一个整体。它们必须相互结合。
    具体地说，中央工业要和地方工业相结合的必要性，表现在哪些方面呢？
    大家知道，现代工业的特点之一是需要相互密切协作。中央工业只是一些在国民经济中起主导作用的、技术复杂的企业，它们的生产却需要许多技术较简单的地方工业企业进行协作配合。例如，一辆汽车是由三千多个部件和零件装配起来的，长春汽车厂需要的不少零件，是由地方机械工厂供应的。某些大钢铁厂需要的铁矿石、生铁，也有一部分是地方工业企业供应的。中央工业企业生产和建设中需要的石棉、硫磺、云母、石墨、水银、松香、异形的小型钢材以及砖、瓦、石灰等，也全部或大部是地方工业企业供应的。至于各地中央工业企业经常的补充设备配件、修理机器设备等工作，也往往离不开地方工业。
    大家也知道，我国幅员广阔，有着无数分散的资源，同时各地在生产和生活上都存在着富有地方特点的多种多样的需要。中央工业只是利用大而集中的资源，只是注意生产关键性的产品，那末，利用各地分散资源，满足各地多种多样需要的责任，就必须由地方工业承担起来。
    此外，经过这几年的建设，地方工业已经有了很大的发展，培养了一批技术力量。玻璃纤维、玻璃纸、感光纸和某些特种塑料、精密仪器、化工原料等，地方工业试制成功了不少。这些技术力量，是中央工业生产中必不可少的有力助手。
    （二）
    在中央工业和地方工业的结合方面，我们以往做了不少工作，获得了不小的成绩，但是也存在着一些缺点。这主要表现在：对地方工业的作用和潜力还缺乏足够的估计；对某些部门和企业还缺乏周密细致的安排；中央某些部门和企业还存在着求全单干的思想。由于存在这些缺点，中央工业同地方工业之间，各省、市地方工业之间，在原材料和生产任务的分配方面曾出现过某些不适当的现象，如某一时期对地方小煤矿及土纸生产的需要估计不足，压缩过多，是产生供不应求的原因之一。也出现过建设力量重复浪费的现象，如在某些地区，中央与地方先后兴建了一些糖厂，但由于原料不足，以致均不能发挥设备力量，或需将某些厂另行迁移；又如某些地区的当地机修力量本已有余，但在该地新建中央企业仍要自建机修车间。也出现过需要时鼓励地方工业试制或者增加生产，有余时又弃置不顾的现象。如钻探机械在某一时期感到不足，曾组织地方某些机械厂试制和较大量地生产，但有余时又要它转移生产其他产品。这些缺点在一定程度上都妨碍着地方工业积极性的发挥，也浪费了国家一些建设资金。当然，这些缺点在中央工业企业之间，也程度不同地存在着。应该指出，统筹安排不够是同我国计划经济的要求不相符合的；而“万事不求人”的单干思想，又是落后的自给经济时代的思想反映。另一方面，由于地方工业与中央工业间及各省市地方工业间缺乏密切的联系，也产生过一些盲目发展的现象，如某些省市的建筑五金材料及水暖器材已有剩余，而另一些省市又进行新建、扩建；全国原药加工的制药设备原有多余，但某些省市也进行了新建、扩建。这也增加了全国统筹安排的一些困难，同样也是与计划经济的要求不相符合的。
    毛主席在“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”讲演中，曾经指出我国工业化的道路“是以重工业为中心”，同时，“必须充分注意发展农业和轻工业”。因此，不论中央工业和地方工业，都需要以相当大的精力，注意组织和发展肥料、农药、农业机械等工业的生产，以支援农业的发展；也需要注意发展可以代替农业原料的工业生产，发展农业原料的综合利用，以减轻因生产和需要不断扩大而加给农业的压力。这些方面的资源勘探、技术试验、设备供应、生产协作等工作，也都需要中央工业和地方工业进行最密切的配合，从而更丰富了两者相互结合的内容。
    针对这些情况，在第二个五年计划期间，我们应当如何改进中央工业和地方工业之间的结合呢？我认为主要应当注意如下各点。
    第一、应该加强以中央工业各主管部门为主的产品平衡工作，使产品的供产销和企业的新建、扩建计划，都能纳入平衡计算，以保证中央工业同地方工业在这些方面彼此衔接，相互协调。在处理平衡工作的时候，需要注意使中央工业和地方工业都能各尽其力，各施所长；使各企业生产能力的有余和不足之间能相互调节；同时要注意使目前和将来互相结合，以便根据每年农业丰歉和原料盈缺的不同情况调剂生产。计划管理工作也不要过死过宽，应该使地方和企业有一定权限，以便在不违反全国平衡的原则下，能因时因地制宜，更好地完成国家计划。
    第二、需要适当改变目前的工业管理体制。新的管理体制要适应中央工业中新建企业陆续投入生产、第二个五年计划期间建厂任务更加繁重的情况，将一部分中央工业中技术并不十分复杂、规模并不十分巨大，或者原材料主要取自当地而产品又主要供应当地的企业，划归地方管理。这样既可以加强地方工业进一步发展的骨干力量，又可以使这些下放的企业能够更好地取得地方党政的领导和支持，更好地发挥作用。新的管理体制还应该使地方和企业有较现在为多的财权，以利于提高其积极性，并且使它们有比较充分的资金，以便按照当地和本企业的资源和技术条件主动地进行发展生产的规划。新的管理体制还需要给地方以较现在为多的权限，加强对当地中央工业企业的指导和监督，以便使地方有可能及时发现和解决当地中央工业和地方工业之间存在的协作中的问题。
    第三、逐步调整中央工业同地方工业之间比较具体的分工协作关系。这种分工协作关系，一方面要使中央工业能够真正集中力量担负起日益繁重的建立工业化骨干力量的任务，另一方面要使地方工业在为农村经济服务和为国家建设、为大工业服务的要求下，更具体地明确今后的努力方向，以便地方能统一规划和掌握当地的工业建设。因此，除了满足地方需要的各种中、小型轻重工业应该继续由地方举办以外，属于全国普遍需要的一般轻工业，也应该归地方管理。重工业中虽然是全国所需但是技术不复杂、规模不大、宜于由地方管理的采矿、粗炼、一般通用的中小型机器以及某些非标准的设备配件和零件制造工业，在不妨碍中央工业的合理经营和不妨碍产品质量的原则下，也宜于尽量划归地方发展。某些中央工业供应不足的工业原料、燃料，如各种化学原料工业、煤炭等，只要地方有条件的，也宜于鼓励地方发展。当地中央工业企业的废料利用，更宜于由地方举办。当然，这种分工也不是机械的。
    第四、对于地方工业的现有力量，应该给以合理利用。某些地方工业企业具有较好技术条件的，中央工业也应结合自己的需要，或委托它试验和试制新产品，或利用它的原有基础，协助它进行改建、扩建。新建中央工业企业的机修、木工等辅助性的车间，更应注意充分利用地方工业已有的力量，尽量少建或不建。
    （三）
    在第二个五年计划期间，地方工业将由于国家以较前更大的注意力来发展农业和人民生活的逐步改善而有进一步的发展，这是完全符合国家的利益的。但是，为了防止地方工业在发展过程中可能产生的盲目性，地方工业也应该注意使自己的发展置于全国平衡的基础之上。就是说，凡产供销关系需要进行全国平衡的，必需服从国家的平衡，避免因自己的发展而使其他省、市出现生产萎缩或设备不能合理利用的现象，打乱了国家统筹安排的原则。对于省内产销的产品，也应本此原则加强省内的平衡工作。
    在新建、扩建工程中，应该注意防止贪大贪新的片面做法。地方工业的重要优点正是规模较小，投资较少，投入生产较快，因而能充分利用分散的资源，能及时满足需要，能减轻大量物资长途运输对国家交通干线的压力，如果片面地追求大规模或最新技术，就很难保持这些优点。
    地方工业在制订发展规划的时候，还应该慎重考虑资金、技术和设备供应的可能性，不应该仅从需要出发。在整个社会主义建设的过渡阶段中，生产不能充分满足需要将是比较普遍的现象，不可能设想在一个短时期内就解决国家建设和人民生活中的全部问题。因此，必须权衡需要的轻重缓急，按部就班地进行建设，以免计划落空或积累的使用过于分散。
