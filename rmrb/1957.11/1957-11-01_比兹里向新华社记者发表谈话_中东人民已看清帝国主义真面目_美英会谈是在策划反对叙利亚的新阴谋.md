Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, October 31st: This reporter, Jin Kengran, reports: Syrian Armed Forces Commander-in-Chief Bizri said on the evening of October 28th, when meeting with a Xinhua News Agency reporter, that the unity of the people in the Middle East region "has been increasing daily. People with different opinions all believe in one point, which is that we must first kick out the imperialists, and then talk about private matters."

When the reporter thanked General Bizri for meeting him despite his busy schedule, General Bizri said, "I am always very happy to meet Chinese friends."

In his simply decorated office, Bizri sat in a chair behind his desk and began the conversation. He began by saying in a firm tone: "Imperialism in this region used to dictate and do whatever it wanted, but things and situations have changed. Now we can firmly tell the imperialists: the only law that can be enforced in our country is our law, not theirs, and the only will that can rule this country is the will of our people, not theirs and their lackeys. The people of this region have learned from their struggle against imperialism, and the faces of the imperialists, especially the American imperialists, have been completely exposed to these people."

General Bizri, who is about forty years old, was amiable and kind. While lighting a cigarette, he continued, "After imperialism went bankrupt in the face of Syria's strong front, it was greatly disappointed, so it began to look for other means to attack our national position. In the past, it used its tool Israel and pretended to be a judge, but now it is starting to use Turkey and Israel against Syria, which can only expose its sinister face. After the imperialist elements were disappointed with internal activities, they immediately put external pressure on Syria. This is the reason for Turkey's current mobilization of troops, Israel's recent exercises, and Dulles' and Lodge's hysterical cries."

Bizri said, "The Chinese people understand all these things because they have suffered a lot before."

Regarding the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's upcoming exercise in the Eastern Mediterranean, he pointed out: "This is a continuation of the threatening and provocative movement against Syria." He said firmly, "This certainly can never change the existing facts: despite these constant exercises, we are prepared to defend our country."

When our topic turned to the recent meeting between Eisenhower and Macmillan, he said, "The talks show that they are still continuing to implement the position-of-strength policy favored by Dulles. There is no doubt that the purpose of the talks was not to ease the tension in the Middle East, because the result of the talks was to conduct new exercises, rather than to withdraw the troops they are now gathering to threaten Syria. All of this shows that they held talks to plan new plans against Syria and world peace after the Soviet Union exposed their old conspiracies."

Bizri listed the facts of the constant provocations by the United States and Turkey, and reiterated Syria's firm stance of never considering accepting mediation. He said that this is definitely not a question of mediation, but a question of preventing a premeditated aggression against Syria.

He also asked: "Why do they refuse a commission of inquiry?" He pointed out, "Only criminals are afraid of investigation."

When talking about Syria's resolute attitude to resist any aggression, Bizri said that we are only defending justice. The justice of our cause makes us ready to sacrifice ourselves when we defend our motherland with great enthusiasm. Our soldiers understand why they are fighting. They know that they must defend their homes and children that imperialism wants to plunder.

Bizri expressed his gratitude for the "lofty and brotherly feelings" of the Chinese people towards the Syrian people. He said that when we defend our rights, we are strong not only because of ourselves, but also because the Arab people and the people of the world support us. We have confidence in ourselves precisely because of this.

During my visit, which lasted more than a hundred minutes, Bizri continued to handle his official business while waiting for my friend to translate his words for me. His secretary often came in to ask for his instructions. Many messages were conveyed to him by telephone. Telegrams requesting to participate in the anti-aggression struggle and support Syria's just struggle were also placed on his desk by his secretary. The atmosphere in Bizri's office reflects the current national combat atmosphere in Syria.

    比兹里向新华社记者发表谈话
    中东人民已看清帝国主义真面目
    美英会谈是在策划反对叙利亚的新阴谋
    据新华社大马士革31日电　本社记者金铿然报道：叙利亚武装部队总司令比兹里10月28日晚间在接见新华社记者的时候说，中东地区“人民的团结已经日益加强。不同见解的人都相信一点，这就是必须首先踢出帝国主义者，然后再谈私事”。
    当记者对比兹里将军在百忙中接见表示感谢的时候，比兹里将军说：“我一向是很高兴会见中国朋友的”。
    在他的布置得简单朴素的办公室里，比兹里坐在桌后的椅子上开始了谈话。他首先以坚定的语气说：“帝国主义在这个地区惯于发号施令，为所欲为，但是事情和情况已经改变了。现在我们可以坚决地告诉帝国主义者：能够在我们国家里施行的唯一的法律，是我们的而不是他们的法律，能够统治这个国家的唯一意志是我国人民的意志，而不是它和它的走卒的意志。这个地区的人民已经从他们反对帝国主义的斗争中汲取了经验教训，帝国主义者、特别是美帝国主义者的面目已经在这些人民面前暴露无遗。”
    年约四十岁的比兹里将军态度和蔼可亲，他一边点香烟，一边继续说，“帝国主义在叙利亚的强大阵线面前破产以后大为失望，于是就开始寻找另外的手段来打击我们的民族立场。在过去，它习惯于利用它的工具以色列，并且装出一付法官的面孔，但是它现在开始利用土耳其和以色列来反对叙利亚了，这只能暴露出它的罪恶面貌。帝国主义分子在对从内部活动失望以后立刻就对叙利亚施加外来的压力。这就是土耳其目前结集军队，以色列最近的演习，以及杜勒斯和洛奇的歇斯底里的叫嚣的原因。”
    比兹里说，“中国人民了解所有这些事情，因为他们以前遭受过许多苦难。”
    关于北大西洋公约组织即将在东地中海进行的演习，他指出：“这是对叙利亚进行的威胁和挑衅运动的继续。”他坚定地说，“这当然永远不能改变现存的事实：尽管不断地有这种演习，我们准备保卫我们的国家。”
    当我们的话题转到艾森豪威尔和麦克米伦最近举行的会谈的时候，他说，“会谈表明，他们仍然在继续执行为杜勒斯所喜爱的实力地位政策。毫无疑问，举行会谈的目的并不是要缓和中东的紧张局势，因为会谈的结果是进行新的演习，而不是撤退他们现在集结起来威胁叙利亚的部队。所有这些都表明，他们举行会谈是为了在苏联揭露了他们的旧阴谋以后又策划反对叙利亚和世界和平的新计划。”
    比兹里列举了美国和土耳其不断挑衅的事实，并且再度表示了叙利亚绝不考虑接受调停的坚定立场。他说，无疑，这不是一个调停问题，而是防止对叙利亚的预谋侵略的问题。
    他还问道：“他们为什么拒绝调查委员会？”他指出，“只有罪犯才害怕调查”。
    比兹里在谈到叙利亚抵抗任何侵略的坚决态度时说，我们只是在保卫正义。我们的事业的正义性使我们在以极大的热诚保卫我们的祖国时准备牺牲我们自己。我们的士兵明白他们为什么而战。他们知道他们必须保卫帝国主义所想掠夺的他们的家园和儿童。
    比兹里表示感谢中国人民对叙利亚人民的“崇高和兄弟般的感情”。他说，在保卫我们的权利的时候，我们所以强有力并不是单单由于我们自己，而是由于阿拉伯人民和全世界人民都支持我们。我们所以自己具有信心就是因为这一点。
    在我历时一百多分钟的访问过程中，每当比兹里等待我的朋友把他的话翻译给我听的时候，他就继续办理他的公事。他的秘书常常走进来向他请示。许多消息由电话传给他。请求参加反侵略战斗和支持叙利亚的正义斗争的电报也由他的秘书放在他的桌子上。比兹里办公室里的气氛正反映着叙利亚目前全国的战斗气氛。
