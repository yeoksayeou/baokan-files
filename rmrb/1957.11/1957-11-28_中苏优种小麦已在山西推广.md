	Sino-Soviet Superior Wheat Varieties Promoted in Shanxi
	The Sino-Soviet No. 68 superior wheat variety has achieved a bumper harvest in Taigu County, Shanxi Province, and is being promoted throughout the province this year. This wheat is a superior variety resulting from the hybridization of Jinzhong wheat and Soviet wheat. This year, Taigu County planted 19,000 mu, with a yield of 141 jin per mu, an increase of 36.7% compared to the average yield of ordinary wheat. In irrigated areas, the Wuyi Cooperative achieved an average yield of 288 jin per mu, an increase of 112 jin compared to the cooperative's hybrid wheat. This wheat is characterized by tight husks that do not easily shed grains, strong resistance to wind and pests, long ears, thick stalks, resistance to lodging, and high yield. In addition to large-scale planting in this county, more than one million jin have been promoted in nine counties including Yuci and Qi County. (Shu Bin)

    中苏优种小麦已在山西推广
    中苏六八号优种小麦，已在山西太谷县获得丰收，今年推广到全省。这种小麦是晋中小麦与苏联小麦杂交后的一种优种小麦，今年太谷县种了一万九千亩，亩产一百四十一斤，较平常小麦的平均亩产增产36．7％，水浇地区五一社平均亩产了二百八十八斤，较本社杂种小麦增产一百一十二斤。这种小麦的特点是壳紧不易落粒，抗风、抗病虫力强，穗长、杆粗、不易倒伏、产量高。今年除在本县大量种植外，还在榆次、祁县等九个县推广一百多万斤。　　（树彬）
