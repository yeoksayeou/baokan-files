Make the Water Go West, and It Goes West
	Zeng Yuqiu
	In the eastern Fujian region, riverbeds are shallow, and streams are rapid. A few more rains bring floods; a few more sunny days bring droughts. When water is needed, it never comes; when it's not needed, it always arrives.

	Opening the "Fuan County Chronicle," one can see records filled with blood and tears:

	In the 19th year of Hongwu in the Ming Dynasty, a great flood submerged most of the people, and the fields lay in ruins, desolate for more than ten years.

	In the seventh month of the fifth year of Chenghua, the East and Second Creeks overflowed, accompanied by fierce winds and heavy rain. The water level was five feet higher than in the 19th year of Hongwu, leading to consecutive years of famine twenty years later.

	From the third to the sixth month of the sixteenth year of Jiajing, there was no rain, and more than half of the fields were barren.

	In the twenty-eighth year, a drought occurred, resulting in a great famine and epidemic, with two thousand deaths.

	After the sixteenth year of Wanli, the wells dried up, leading to continuous years of drought and famine.

	On the thirteenth day of the seventh month of the eleventh year of Shunzhi in the Qing Dynasty, there was a sudden heavy rain, torrential and surging, with water heads of over a zhang. On the fourteenth night, a dragon emerged from Hou Mountain at Daliu Dongshan Chuanzhan, passing through Santang in the twenty-ninth du, collapsing the pond dams, flooding the pond fields, and causing a complete crop failure in Tongyang.

	In the summer of the fifteenth year of Daoguang, there was a drought. It did not rain from the fourth to the eighth month, leading to a great famine in the winter, and many villagers starved to death. …

	For many years, farmers have lived like this, letting the water dictate their fate.

	For many years, people have been thinking: When can we control the water?

Twice Green in a Year
	This ideal was finally realized after the establishment of advanced cooperatives.

	1956 was a year of unfavorable weather – with both floods and droughts. However, with the centralized use of labor in advanced cooperatives, the situation was different from the past.

	In Wanwu Township, Fuan County, although more than 1,800 mu of rain-fed fields were affected by more than sixty days of drought and two floods, and more than 700 mu of rice suffered from pests, and the late rice was hit by a typhoon just as it was heading, grain production still increased by 72,335 jin.

	The main reason for the increased production was the change from intercropping rice to continuous cropping.

	Here, there used to be a saying: "Early rice is good, but late rice is terrible." The black soil pond fields of Wanwu are good in quality, but the water conservancy is inconvenient. If there is no water for a few days after the early rice is harvested, the late rice seedlings cannot be transplanted, leading to a severe reduction in yield. How could they dare to boldly change to continuous cropping?

	It was possible to change to continuous cropping after the establishment of the advanced cooperative because six water conservancy projects, including the "Be Careful Sluice," were built, allowing 1,720 mu of fields to be irrigated. This converted 630 mu of intercropped rice fields into continuous cropping rice fields.

	This year, there was another severe drought. After the continuous early rice was harvested, there was still no water to transplant late rice seedlings on 280 mu of land, and even the soil cracked. However, it is easier to manage when the land is connected into large tracts. The experienced farmers studied the situation, and the production teams consulted with each other. The advanced cooperative uniformly controlled the water source and used water rationally, diverting water from Lingdou and other four places covering more than 200 mu of rice fields to the Mentang, Hongmaotang, and Menqiantang and other four tracts of fields for transplanting, managing to plant continuous cropping late rice on more than 190 mu of land.

	Twice green in a year, only because of the "Be Careful Sluice." In the past, people described the terrain here as "Nine" streams converging into one river – the water flowing from the mountains converged here and flowed into the sea. The river is more than 460 zhang long and is a large canal for both drainage and storage. 615 mu of fields rely on this water for irrigation. However, in the past, with private land ownership, people privately reclaimed the land along the river, and the river channel narrowed year by year, reducing the water storage capacity year by year. Therefore, floods and droughts brought countless disasters to the farmers. After liberation, people had long hoped to dredge the river, but they dared not take action because they were not united. Although the elementary cooperative carried out repairs the year before last, it only built one sluice gate due to the lack of manpower and fear of occupying other people's land. After the establishment of the advanced cooperative, the repair of the sluice river was included in the annual production plan. The members were enthusiastic and widened the river surface from one zhang five chi to three zhang, and deepened it by six chi, increasing the water storage capacity by two times. During the drought resistance period, more than 30 waterwheels were operated day and night by the whole cooperative for more than 30 days. Last year, there were two more floods, but the sluice gates were opened, and the floods flowed smoothly, without flooding the rice fields. More than 40 mu of low-yielding fields in Guocuotang are now no longer afraid of flooding. The Wanwu farmers have also planted lychee trees on the堤防. In a few years, it will be a green forest with red fruits.

Two Enemy Villages and a Stream

	The private ownership of land brought distrust between people and caused the water to suffer injustice. In the Huotong Town area of ​​Ningde County, people sang: "Shichiao, Shansia is one family, only because of individual farming becoming enemies..."

	Shansia Village and Shichiao Village are only a little over a li apart, and both have the surname Huang. Shansia Village is small, with barren land and high fields with little water source. Their ancestors could not support their families by farming, so they built oil mills and flour mills in front of Shichiao Village. The Shichiao Village landlord said: "Shansia Village cries to Shichiao all day long, which will destroy the feng shui of Shichiao." They wanted to demolish the oil mills and flour mills, but the people of Shansia would not agree. The landlord said: "Okay! We will build coffin buildings here and let you mourn!" More than 30 "coffin buildings" appeared opposite the flour mill (local custom: after a person dies, they are not buried immediately, but the coffin is placed in a certain place and covered with a small house called a "coffin building," and it is believed that the place opposite the "coffin building" is unlucky.).

	Later, in a year of severe drought with no rain, the fields in Shansia were cracked by the sun. However, there was a ditch bypassing Shansia Village, flowing into the fields of Shichiao. The farmers of Shansia could not bear to watch the rice die of drought, so they opened a ditch to divert the water. Who knew that the people of Shichiao said: "This ditch was dug by our ancestors." They would not allow the people of Shansia to divert water. The people of Shansia said: "We share the same ancestors, but the people of Shichiao do not acknowledge it and even sing to scold us." The two villages argued fiercely and started fighting with sticks. The people of Shichiao were more numerous and beat the people of Shansia bloody. The lawsuit was taken to the county yamen. Shichiao had high influence, and they won the lawsuit, sealing up the ditch that had been opened to Shansia. Without water, the rice fields in Shansia had to be converted to sweet potatoes. Since then, the two villages often engaged in armed fights, never spoke to each other, and never intermarried.

	When the farmers of Shansia were pressing oil and grinding wheat, they felt very sad when they saw the dark "coffin buildings" and the water flowing around the village during droughts.

	After the establishment of the advanced cooperative, the cooperative director, Peng Lianzhai, discovered that there was fertile soil that had not been dug for a hundred years around the "coffin buildings." He proposed to move the "coffin buildings" and dig out the fertile soil to use as fertilizer. The people of Shichiao and Shansia dug more than 10,000 loads of fertilizer shoulder to shoulder, improving more than 100 mu of fields, and planted one mu of "10,000 jin sweet potatoes" on the old site of the "coffin buildings."

	The members of Shichiao Village said: "Advanced cooperatives do not distinguish between you and me, and the water of the society is used by the society." More than 100 laborers from the two villages spent three consecutive days digging a ditch from "Longyaodai" to divert water to Shansia Village, and they also dug up the ditch that had been sealed in front of Shansia Village in the past. The river water flowed into the fields of Shansia Village, and 60 mu of sweet potato fields in the whole village were converted to rice fields. The water brought a bumper harvest. In June, standing in front of the door and looking around, there were golden rice fields everywhere. The ditch flows windingly into the village, clear and bright. Women wash clothes by the ditch, and children actively bathe and play water fights by the village. Huang Di'er, an old man from Shansia Village, had participated in two armed fights because of the water in this ditch. Now, watching the people of Shichiao personally dig it open and irrigate the water to Shansia, he exclaimed, "The world has changed!"

Making the Flood Listen to the Farmers

	Qukou Township in Qin Island District of Fuding has more than 1,000 mu of land from Qukou to Dongdi, facing the vast sea. Relying on the Dongcheng Dike, there is only one sluice gate, which is very inconvenient for drainage. Whenever mountain floods break out, the floods rush down from the high mountains of Xinmei Village, more than ten li away, and swallow the entire Qukou Ocean. Moreover, the water cannot be stored. After the mountain flood rushes from top to bottom, it cannot withstand half a month of drought, and the field water dries up again. The Shuidaioyang area is low-lying. After three days of rain, you can see the white water of Tongyang, and you can row boats in the fields. But after a few days, it dries up again. This is a field that has been harvested nine years out of ten. The Menxia River is the throat of the Qukou Ocean, and the floods from the upper ocean flow into the sea through here. Farmers have a saying: "The fields of Qukou are like streams, and good women are not for farmers." Because of the disasters and low yields, they cannot afford to marry a wife. Although the land in Shangyang is good, the yield per mu is only about 200 jin.

	For generations, farmers have wanted to dig a port to drain the mountain floods, but they did not have the strength. After Qukou and Dongcheng merged to form an advanced cooperative, with a total of more than 510 member households, it took only more than 20 days to open two new ports on the Qukou Ocean, more than 700 zhang long, more than two zhang wide, and five chi five cun deep. From then on, they were no longer afraid of mountain floods. In August, a typhoon brought heavy rain, and mountain floods rolled in. The three newly established sluice gates of Dongcheng were opened, and the stream water obediently flowed into the sea along the new port. The members said: "The floods of Qukou Ocean listen to the farmers and no longer harm the crops." Although the disaster was great, it was like a good year with gentle breeze and light rain. The yield per mu of 750 mu of fields averaged 250 jin, an increase of more than 290 dan of grain, or more than 40%, compared to the previous year.

	If it doesn't rain for three days, it becomes a drought. People living in Wuliyang, Ningde County, are truly tormented by droughts. During droughts, farmers sleep in the fields to watch the water until dawn, often arguing until midnight over the water.

	The year before last, with the strength of cooperation, a 32-li-long Wuliyang canal was jointly opened. This allows 15,137 mu of land to be irrigated.

	In June last year, there was a drought for more than 50 days. This was the period of summer plowing for continuous rice and tillering for intercropped rice. In the past, the whole ocean was filled with the sound of competing for water. Water is so important! The newly cooperating farmers were still a little worried. The Nancheng cooperative even sent members to the border to compete for water. Every drop of water was more precious than oil. In the advanced cooperative, the land was entered into the cooperative, and large tracts were connected to work together, eliminating the complications of "you" and "me". They organized a drought resistance headquarters to uniformly allocate water resources, irrigating in rotation according to the urgency of the need. The cooperative also selected specialists to be responsible for the allocation of water resources.

	For the first time, the water of Wuliyang listened so well, flowing east when told to flow east, and flowing west when told to flow west, allowing more than 10,000 mu of fields to be planted on time. With this canal, coupled with rational management, a bumper harvest was brought. Last year, the total production of early and late rice increased by 47%.

	This spring, 3,000 meters of main canals and 6,800 meters of branch canals were built on the entire Wuliyang, and three new branch canals were opened, increasing the irrigation area by more than 900 mu. The irrigation system has also been adjusted more rationally. Last year, the management was not very good, and a lot of labor was wasted, and many places that should have been irrigated were not. This year, the superiority of the advanced cooperative has been further brought into play, adjusting the scattered land and opening more field ditches, allowing more fields to be irrigated. Some agricultural cooperatives have also built six control gates in the branch canals to raise the water level, making irrigation more convenient.

Competing for Land with the Sea God

	This year, the largest project in the entire region, the Wenwusha reclamation project in Changle County, is about to be completed. It is located in the east of Changle County, with two large sand mountains extending straight into the sea like dragons playing in the water. Between the two mountains is a large sandy beach called Wenwusha, which used to bring disasters to farmers every year. When the tide receded, it was a sandy land that was difficult to cultivate; when the tide came, it was a vast ocean. If strong winds and tides came, the nearby Hujing Township and Dongshan Township would suffer greatly. If a sluice gate and a large dike were built between these two mountains, the sea water could be blocked, eliminating the disaster, and more than 17,000 mu of beach inside the dike would become fertile land. However, to build an 18-hole large sluice gate and a 3-li-long sea dike, not counting the wood and labor, just the stone alone would require more than 669,000 dan, something that individual farmers would never dare to dream of. After the cooperative was established, the state allocated 1.15 million yuan and established a project headquarters. All 48 cooperative townships in the county mobilized 397,000 laborers and boatmen to support the project. The soil here is sandy, and the water surges upwards, making it difficult to build a solid sluice foundation. The engineers consulted with experienced farmers to come up with a solution: three water pumps were brought in to pump water day and night, and more than 3,000 large fir trees were driven into the beach bottom, covered with three layers of stone strips and lime soil to solidify the sluice foundation. In September, a storm came, and 400 laborers bravely rushed to the construction site, carrying and digging, fighting the wind and rain for 17 hours, and finally protecting the dam.

	In early February of this year, the dike extension project began. This project involves extending a 3-li-long dike from the left side of the sluice gate, running across the east and west banks. When the east bank sea dike was extended half a li, a sinkhole 53 meters long and 7 meters deep was suddenly discovered in front. The east bank labor brigade called on the laborers: "We will never stop until the sinkhole is filled!" More than 500 laborers from Jinfeng, Dongwu, and other townships launched a competition, proposing: "We must compete with the sea for time. We will start working whenever the tide recedes." For more than ten days, regardless of the snow or the wind and rain, as long as the tide receded, people fought bravely. After a year of labor, the 18-hole large sluice gate project was completed at the end of February this year, and the dike extension project is still in intense battle. The first year's yield per mu of the 17,000 mu of newly reclaimed land can reach 400 jin. After the land is desalinated, it can be increased to 800 jin, with a total annual output of 13.6 million jin. At the same time, it also protects 15,000 mu of fields from salt water damage, which can also increase grain production by more than 3 million jin each year. In addition to irrigating farmland, the 1,000 mu of rivers, ponds, ditches, and canals inside the dam can also be used to raise freshwater fish. More than 20,000 citrus trees can also be planted on the old dike. A folk song circulates among the 200,000 people of Changle:

Wenwusha, a good place, different from before. In the past, it was a sandy beach, with winds and tides turning into a vast ocean; now, sluice gates are built for reclamation, and a sea dike three li long is constructed. From now on, the sea water will listen to people, and rice will be produced on the barren beach.

	Last year, the eastern Fujian region was short of water and had too much water, with drought and floods. However, because advanced cooperatives were established and water conservancy projects were vigorously built, the irrigation area increased and improved by nearly 288,000 mu. With the cooperation of other measures, the total output of grain and beans in the region this year increased by 5.14% compared with 1955. The average output per capita based on the agricultural population was 667 jin, an increase of 13 jin compared with 1955.

	Since the beginning of September this year, a new upsurge in autumn water conservancy construction has been set off in the eastern Fujian region. This autumn's water conservancy construction started early and is large in scale. It is estimated that after the completion of the water conservancy plan next year, the region will increase the irrigation area by 277,000 mu, which can increase grain production by 181,000 dan.

    叫水向西就向西
    曾毓秋
    在闽东地区，河床浅，溪流急，多下了几阵雨，就是涝灾；多出了几天太阳，又是旱灾。要水的时候，偏偏不来；不要的时候，它偏偏又来了。
    翻开“福安县志”，可以看到充满血泪的记载：
    明洪武十九年大水，人民淹没大半田园丘墟十数年荒落。
    成化五年七月，东平二溪水溢，狂风猛雨从之，水势较之洪武十九年高加五尺，二十年以后连荒。
    嘉靖十六年三月至六月不雨，田园荒过半。
    二十八年旱，大荒大疫，死者二千人。
    万历十六年之后，井泉涸，连岁旱荒。
    清顺治十一年七月十三日，陡然骤雨，滂沱汹涌，水头丈余；十四夜，大留东山传展后山蛟出路，由下二十九都三塘经过，推陷塘坝，潮浸塘田，通洋绝收。
    道光十五年夏旱，四月不雨至于八月，冬大饥，乡民多饿死。…………
    多少年来，农民就是这样生活过来的，任凭水来摆布自己的命运。
    多少年来，人们都在想：什么时候，我们才能把水控制住。
    一年可见两次青
    这个理想在高级合作化以后终于实现了。
     1956年是个风不调、雨不顺的年头——又有洪水，又有旱灾。可是，高级社里集中使用劳力，光景就同过去不一般了。
    在福安县的湾坞乡，虽说是一千八百多亩靠天水灌溉的田，受到六十多天旱灾和两次洪水的袭击，而且有七百多亩水稻受到虫害，晚稻刚刚吐穗的时候，又遭到台风。可是，就这样，粮食还增产了七万二千三百三十五斤。
    增产的主要原因是把水稻从间作改成了连作。
    在这里，过去流传着一句话：“早稻好来晚稻糟。”湾坞的一片黑土塘田，土质好是好，可是水利不方便，要是收了早稻那几天没有水，晚稻插不下秧，就要严重减收。这样，怎敢大胆改连作呢？
    办了高级社就能改连作，是因为修了“当心闸”等六项水利，有一千七百二十亩田可以灌到水。这样就把六百三十亩间作稻田改成连作稻田。
    这年又遇上了大旱，收完连作早稻，还有二百八十亩田插不下晚稻秧，连田土都晒裂了。可是，土地连成大片就是好办事，老农们研究了一番，各个生产队互相商量，由高级社统一控制水源，合理用水。把岭兜等四处二百多亩稻田的水放到面前塘、红毛塘、门前塘等四片田插秧，抢插了一百九十多亩田连作晚稻。
    一年能见两次青，只因有了当心闸。过去农民形容这里的地形是“九”溪归一河——山上流来的水，在这里汇到一起，流进大海里去。河长有四百六十多丈，是排蓄两用的大沟渠。有六百十五亩田要靠这里的水灌溉。但是，过去土地私有，河边的土地，群众私自开垦，河身年年缩小，蓄水能力年年降低。因此，洪旱两害，不知道给农民带来了多少灾难。解放以后，人们早就希望疏通河道；因为心不齐，不敢动手。前年初级社虽说进行了修理，但是，人力少，又怕占了别人的土地，只修了一个水闸就罢了手。高级社办起后，把修闸河列入全年的生产规划。社员们热情奋发，把河面从一丈五放宽到三丈，又加深了六尺，蓄水量提高了两倍。在抗旱期中，全社三十多架水车昼夜车水三十多天。去年又有两次洪水，打开闸门，洪水畅通，稻田没有受淹。郭厝塘有四十多亩低产田，现在也不怕受淹了。湾坞农民还在堤上种下了荔枝树，过几年，该是一片绿林红果了。
    两个冤家村和一条溪流
    土地私有制带来了人与人之间的不信任，也叫流水受了委屈。宁德县霍童镇那一带，人们唱着：“石桥、山下是一家，只因单干成冤家……”
    山下村和石桥村，相隔只有一里多路，都是姓黄的。山下村小，地瘦田高水源少，他们的祖先靠种田养不活家，在石桥村面前修起油坊和磨坊。石桥村地主说：“山下一天到晚对着石桥大哭，会破坏了石桥的风水。”要想拆掉油坊磨坊，山下人哪里会肯。地主说：“好吧！我们这里修棺材楼，让你们来哭丧吧！”磨坊对面出现了三十多个“棺材楼”（当地风俗，人死后不立刻下葬，而把棺材停放在一定地方，盖上个小房子，叫“棺材楼”；并认为与“棺材楼”相对的地方是不吉利的。）。
    后来，有年大旱无雨，山下的田被晒得裂开了。山下村边却有一条水渠绕过，流进石桥的田里去。山下农民不能眼看着稻子旱死，就开了条水沟把水引进来。谁知石桥人说：“这水渠是我祖宗开的。”不让山下人引水。山下人说：“我们共祖宗，石桥人不承认，还唱歌骂我们。”两村大吵，摸出棍棒就干。石桥人多，把山下人打得头破血流。官司打到了县衙门，石桥势力高，官司打胜了，把开进山下的水渠封起来。山下村没有水，稻田只好改种甘薯。此后，两个村时常械斗，见面不说话，永远不结亲。
    山下农民在榨油磨麦时，看到那一片黑压压的“棺材楼”，天旱时看见那绕过村边的流水，心里很伤痛。
    办了高级社，社长彭连宅发现“棺材楼”四周有百年未挖的肥土，提出移开“棺材楼”，把肥土挖出来当肥料。石桥人和山下人肩并肩挖了一万多担肥料，改良了一百多亩田，并且在“棺材楼”旧地上种了一亩“万斤薯”。
    石桥村的社员说：“高级社不分你我，社会的水社会用。”两个村出了一百多个劳力，接连三天，从“龙腰带”开进一条水渠，把水引进山下村，又把山下村前过去被封的水沟挖开来。河水流进山下村的田地，全村有六十亩番薯地改成了稻田。水，带来了个丰收的年成。六月天，站在门前望，四周都是黄澄澄的稻子。水渠弯弯曲曲流进村里，清清亮亮的，妇女们在渠边搓洗衣裳，小孩子活跃地在村边洗澡、打水战。山下村老汉黄第二，因为争这条水渠的水，参加过两次械斗。现在亲眼看着石桥人亲手挖开，把水灌到山下，连叫“世界变了！”
    叫大水听农民的话
    福鼎秦屿区有个渠口乡，从渠口到东堤有一千多亩土地，面临着汪洋大海，依着东埕堤，却只有一个闸门，排水很不便利。每逢山洪暴发，洪水从新梅村十多里远的高山上冲下来，就把整个渠口洋吞没了；而且存不住水，山洪从上到下倾泻过去了，经不起半个月旱，田水又干涸了。水袋洋地势低，下了三天雨，就可以看到通洋白漂漂的水，田里可以划船。但是，没几天就又干了。这是十年九没收的田地。门峡洋是渠口洋的喉咙，上洋的洪水就经过这里流进海。农民有句俗话说：“渠口田当溪，好女不是农民的。”因为有灾害，收成低，讨不起老婆。上洋土地虽好，每亩的产量也只在二百斤左右。
    农民世世代代想挖港排山洪，都没有力量。渠口和东埕合并办了高级社以后，总共有五百一十多户社员，只花了二十多天，就在渠口洋上开辟了两条新港，有七百多丈长，二丈多宽，五尺五寸深。从此不怕山洪了。8月间，台风夹着暴雨，山洪滚滚而来，东埕三个新设的闸门开放，溪水驯服地顺着新港流进大海。社员们说：“渠口洋的洪水听农民的话，不再害庄稼了”，灾害虽大，却像是个和风细雨的好年成。七百五十亩田，每亩平均收成二百五十斤，比前一年还要增产二百九十多担粮食，合四成多。
    三日没雨就成旱，生活在宁德县五里洋的人，真是给旱灾纠缠苦了。每到旱天，农民就睡在田里看水到天亮。常常因为看水，争吵到半夜三更。
    前年，靠着合作的力量，联合开了一条三十二里长的五里洋水渠。这样，这一万五千一百三十七亩土地才有水灌溉了。
    去年6月间，旱了五十多天。这正是连作稻夏耘，间作稻发兜的时期。过去啊，满洋都是争水的声音。水多要紧啊！刚合作的农民，也还有点放心不下呢。南埕社还派了社员到交界处争水。真是，每滴水比油还要贵重。高级社里，土地入了社，大片联起来干，没有了你啦我呀的牵扯。他们组织了抗旱指挥部来统一调用水利。根据需要的缓急，轮流灌溉。社里也选出了专人负责调用水利。
    五里洋的水，头一次这样听话，叫它流向东就流向东，叫它流向西就流向西，使得一万多亩田都按时插上了秧苗。有了这条水渠，加上合理管理，带来了丰收，去年早稻、晚稻总共增产了四成七。
    今年春天，全五里洋上修了干渠三千公尺，支渠六千八百公尺，还新开了三条支渠，又增加灌溉面积九百多亩。灌溉系统也调整得更合理了。去年管理得不很好，浪费了不少劳力，有许多地该灌水没灌到。今年，更充分地发挥高级社的优越性，调整零乱的土地，多开田间毛渠，更多的田能灌到水了。有的农业社在支渠中还新建节制闸六座，提高了水位，灌溉就更方便了。
    向海龙王争地
    今年，全专区最大的工程，长乐县文武砂围垦工程就要大体完工了。它在长乐县城东面，两座大砂山，好像双龙戏水一样直伸到海里去，两座山里是一片大砂滩，这就叫文武砂，过去是个年年给农民带来灾难的地方。海水退了，一片砂地，很难耕作；潮水来了，又是一片汪洋；有了狂风猛潮来，附近的壶井乡和东山乡就要大遭殃了。要是在这两座山间，建一个闸门，筑一条大堤，就可以挡住海水，免除祸害，堤内一万七千多亩海滩也会变成良田。可是，要修一个十八孔的大闸门，一条三里长的海堤、木料、人工不算，光是石头就要六十六万九千多担，单门独户的农民真是做梦也不敢想。在合作化以后，国家拨了一百十五万元，成立了工程指挥部，全县四十八个合作化乡都出动了民工、船工三十九万七千多人来支援。这里是砂地，水向上涌，闸基很难筑得牢。工程师请了老农一起来商量想办法：搬来三架抽水机，日夜不停地抽水，还用三千多根大杉木打入滩底，杉木上盖上三层石条和三合土，把闸基筑牢了。9月间，来了一场暴风雨，四百个民工都英勇的奔向工地，扛的扛，挖的挖，和风雨斗争了十七个钟头，终于把水坝保住了。
    今年2月初，伸堤堵海的工程开始了。这个工程是要在水闸左边伸出一条三里长的堤坝，横贯在东西两岸。当东岸海堤伸出半里长的时候，忽然发现前面有一个五十三公尺长，七公尺深的陷坑。东岸民工大队号召民工们：“不填平深坑，决不罢休！”金峰、东吴等乡五百多个民工发起了竞赛，提出：“要和海水争夺时间，海水什么时候退，就什么时候出工。”以后十多天，不管雪花飘，不管风雨吼，只要海潮一落，人们就英勇地奋斗。经过一年劳动，今年2月底修好了十八孔大水闸工程，伸堤工程还在紧张的战斗中。一万七千亩新垦地，头一年产量每亩可以达到四百斤。土地养淡后，还能提高到八百斤，每年总产量可以达到一千三百六十万斤。同时还保住了一万五千亩田不受盐水害，每年也能增产三百多万斤粮食。围坝内一千亩的河、塘、沟、渠，除了灌溉农田外，还能养殖淡水鱼，旧堤上还能种植两万多株柑桔树，长乐二十万人民中流传着一首歌谣：
    文武砂，好地方，前前后后不一样。从前一片沙滩地，风起潮涨变汪洋；如今修闸来围垦，建筑海堤三里长。从此海水听人话，荒滩上面出米粮。

    去年，闽东地区是水又缺，水又多，旱灾加上洪水。可是，因为办了高级社，大力兴修水利，增加和改善的灌溉面积近二十八万八千亩，加上其他措施的配合，这一年全区粮食和豆类产量比1955年增加了5．14％，按农业人口平均，每人平均产量有六百六十七斤，比1955年增加了十三斤。
    今年9月初起，闽东地区又掀起了秋季兴修水利的新高潮。今秋的水利建设不但动工早，而且规模大。预计明年完成水利计划以后，全区又将增加二十七万七千亩灌溉面积，可以增产粮食十八万一千担。
