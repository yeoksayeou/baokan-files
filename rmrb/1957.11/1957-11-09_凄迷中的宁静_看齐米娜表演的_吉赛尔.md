    Tranquility in the Mist
    —Watching T. Zimina's Performance of "Giselle"
    Qiu Yang
    Like wandering through a magical realm, the performance of the Novosibirsk Ballet from the Soviet Union brings us many beautiful, dreamlike scenes, not only visually, but also in our hearts.
    I had seen Kruglinina's performance in "The Magic Lamp." Her excellent dance movements fully demonstrated her performing talent, and through her performance, we clearly saw how the elegant art of ballet, in delicately expressing complex and diverse emotional states, has such a clear, powerful, and accurate means of expression! In the second act, her portrayal of Budur and the two pas de deux with Aladdin and Vizier, though similarly involving rotations and lifts, so clearly expressed the distinct attitudes of this young woman towards the different objects of her affection and disdain. We didn't hear her speak, but we saw her whole body speaking, speaking so passionately and fluently, with the joy and shy confession of love, as well as the cold aversion and clear rejection. The changes were very significant, but all perfectly unified within the character of this young woman. Through her, we truly saw a distinctive feature of this theater—a focus on clearly and precisely portraying the characters' thoughts and feelings.
    And what convinced me most was the moving image of Giselle created by T. Zimina. She not only allowed us to see the clear emotional state of the character, but also further demonstrated the character's beautiful and profound soul!
    The story of Giselle is inherently moving. This pure girl falls in love with Count Albrecht, who is traveling incognito, and becomes engaged to him; but the latter already has a fiancée. When she discovers the deception, she dies in sorrow, her soul bound by a group of brides who have suffered the same fate. These deceived brides, with intentions of revenge, constantly haunt men at night, dancing them to death. Albrecht encounters them, but Giselle protects him from death, finally fading away into her tomb…
    T. Zimina's creation of Giselle, while accurately portraying the character, reveals a deeper truth: what is most honorable in love, and what kind of person can possess this honorable emotion?!
    The heart-stirring performance begins in the third scene when Giselle discovers she has been deceived.
    Her other suitor, Hans, exposes Albrecht's lie in front of everyone. For Giselle, who is immersed in the intoxication of love, this is simply unimaginable, yet it is the truth. T. Zimina seems to be in a dream, her eyes filled with a kind of bewildered joy, feebly raising her hand to imitate Albrecht's gesture when he swore his oath to her. Their vows, joy, and playfulness—she fleetingly relives her just-passed, still-lingering love with movements (mainly with her eyes). However, her steps are unsteady. At times, her eyes seem to see something she has long been searching for, thus revealing a hint of a smile. People see very clearly that she is trying to use the vanished tenderness to prove that what is happening before her is not real. Slowly, she discovers Albrecht's sword, which Hans brought as evidence, on the ground. Like suddenly discovering a strange object, she circles it, identifies it, and picks up the tip of the sword with her fingers, letting the sword draw a circle on the ground. The sudden blow has already caused her to lose her composure in grief. She stares at this sword that declares the death of her love, her movements slowly slowing down. She seems to gradually approach consciousness from a distant dream, raising her head to seek answers in the empty space: is she in a dream or awake? Albrecht comes forward and attempts to explain something; his expression proves the truth and interrupts her fantasy. Like avoiding a terrible demon, she avoids him, until at this moment, the grief is truly and directly displayed on her. She wants to commit suicide, finally collapsing into her mother's arms and ceasing to breathe, so sadly, so sorrowfully! T. Zimina's performing talent expresses the enormous emotional change of this pure girl from the pinnacle of happiness to the abyss of grief so delicately and pitifully that it evokes sympathy! It very clearly shows us how this girl suddenly comes into contact with the harshness of life from the dream of love! How cruelly the fickle nobleman destroys a pure life!
    The appearance of the Queen of the Wilis, Myrtha, and the Wilis in the fourth act has a cold and desolate tone. Giselle, rising slowly from the grave, does not appear continuing the grief-stricken tune of the previous act. She is stern, or rather, tranquil, somewhat like a cleared and purified expression. But when Albrecht is surrounded by the Wilis, this keynote changes. She is restless, agitated, and tries hard to plead for his forgiveness from the Wilis; but when she faces Albrecht, she is ethereal, elusive, as if a light veil separates her from him. Looking at the person she once loved, her expression is somewhat like the mistiness of the previous act, but even more so, it is tranquil. Here, she is not a vengeful spirit; she does not have that desolation. She is still protecting the person she once loved, but it is no longer love, but pity. This is not the same as not accusing him or not lashing out at him. Her accusation and lash are not accomplished through reproach, but through her behavior at the time: the behavior of being constantly responsible for her love. Like a celestial being overlooking the injustice of the human world, she finally leads him out of the maze, maintaining her purity and tranquility, and slowly fades away into the graveyard, leaving him only a few white flowers, allowing him to muse and regret! The power of this lash is heavy, showing people what is good and what is evil, how goodness and beauty are immortal, and how injustice and ugliness can only bear the condemnation of conscience at the grave!
    This is a misty but tranquil poem, and T. A. Zimina has given this poem a deeper meaning. It is said that playing "Giselle" is a rigorous test for ballet dancers, because it requires superb dance skills, requiring the actor to be good at using dance to skillfully and delicately express the heroine's inner feelings. I think T. Zimina is worthy of this test.

    凄迷中的宁静
    ——看齐米娜表演的“吉赛尔”
    丘扬
    有如漫游一段神奇的境界，苏联新西伯利亚芭蕾舞剧的演出，给我们带来许许多多美丽的、梦幻一般的情境，不独是视觉上的，更其是心灵上的。
    曾看过克鲁宾妮娜在“神灯”中的表演，她的卓越的舞蹈动作，充分展示了她的表演才能，而通过她的表演，使我们明白地看到优美的芭蕾舞艺术，在细致地表达复杂迥异的诸般感情状态上，有着何等鲜明、有力和准确的表现方式！在第二场中她所扮演的布杜尔和阿拉金、维齐尔两段紧紧衔接的双人舞，同样有着回旋、同样有着托举，但却那么清楚地表现出了这个少女在对待她爱的和不爱的不同对象的鲜明态度，我们没听到她在讲话，但却看到，她的全身都在讲着话，讲的那么热烈，那么流畅，有爱情的欢乐和羞涩地告白，也有冷漠的厌恶和明确的拒绝，变化非常显著，但又都完美地统一在这个少女的性格之中，透过她，我们确实看到了这个剧院的一个创造特色——着力地明确地刻划人物思想感情状态的特色。
    而最最说服了我的，是齐米娜所创造的吉赛尔这一动人的形象，她不仅仅让我们看到了人物的明确的感情状态，更进一步展示了人物美丽而深刻的心灵！
    吉赛尔的故事本就是动人的，这个纯洁的少女爱上了微行的伯爵阿尔伯特，并且和他订了婚约；而后者却早有了未婚妻，当她发现被骗时，便悲痛地死去，灵魂为一群遭有同样命运的新娘鬼魂所约制，这群被欺骗的未婚新娘，抱着复仇的意愿时时缠扰着男子们深夜跳舞至死，阿尔伯特遇见了她们，而吉赛尔却保护他免于死亡，自己最后奄然消逝在坟墓之中……
    齐米娜创造的吉赛尔，在准确地刻划人物性格的同时，展示了一条更深刻的道理：在爱情生活中什么是最可尊贵的？以及在人生中什么样的人才有可能具有这种可尊贵的感情！？
    动人心弦的表演，是从第三景吉赛尔发现自己被骗时开始的。
    她的另一个追求者汉斯当着众人的面揭破了阿尔伯特的谎言，对于正沉溺在爱情的迷醉当中的吉赛尔，这简直是不可想像的事，然而这却是事实。齐米娜像是在梦幻之中，眼睛中充满着一种迷惘的欢乐，无力地举起手模仿着阿尔伯特当日向她起誓的动作，她们的誓约、欢乐和游嬉，她飘忽地用动作（更主要地是用眼睛）重温她刚刚逝去余韵犹在的爱情，然而步履是不稳的，时而眼睛中像是看到了她久已寻找的东西因而现出一丝笑意，人们看的很清楚，她是在努力地用已逝的温存来证明眼前所发生的不是事实。慢慢地她在地上发现了汉斯取来做证物的阿尔伯特的佩剑，像是突然发现了一个陌生物件，她围着它转、辨视、用手指捻起了剑尖，让佩剑在地上画了一个圆圈，突然的打击已使她悲痛地失却常态，她注视着这柄宣告她爱情死亡的佩剑，动作慢慢地缓慢下来了。她像是从遥远的梦境中逐渐靠近清醒，抬起了头疑问地向空际寻找答案：是梦中呢还是醒着呢？阿尔伯特上前来企图说明什么，他的神色证明了事实也打断了她的幻想，像是避开一个可怕的恶魔，她避开他，直到这时悲痛才真正地在她身上正面显示出来，她想自杀，最后扑倒在母亲的怀里停止了呼吸，那么凄惋，那么哀痛！齐米娜的表演才能把这个纯洁的少女从幸福的顶巅一下子落到悲痛的深渊的巨大感情变化表现的那么细致、那么可悯地令人同情！十分清楚地让我们看到这个少女如何由爱情的梦幻中一下子接触到了严酷的人生！见异思迁的贵族是多么惨酷地毁灭了一个纯洁的生命啊！
    第四场鬼王弥尔达和维丽茜女鬼们的出现，是具有冷酷和凄厉的情调的，从坟墓中冉冉升起的吉赛尔，却不是沿续着前一场哀痛欲绝的调子出现的，她严冷、或者说宁静，多少有如澄彻了的神情，但当阿尔伯特被女鬼们围住的时候，这基调变化了，她不安，激动，努力地向女鬼们替他恳求宽恕；但当她与阿尔伯特相对时，她是瓢忽的、若即若离地，有如一幅轻纱隔在她与他之间，看着她从前曾爱过的人，神色多少有如前一场的凄迷，但更多地是宁静，在这里，她不是复仇的精灵，她没那份凄厉，她还在保护着她曾爱过的人，然而不再是爱情而是怜悯，这不等于对他没有控诉、没有鞭挞，她的控诉和鞭挞不是用责难来完成的，而是用她当时的行为：她一直在为自己的爱情负责的行为来完成的，像是俯视着人间不义的仙人，最后她引他出迷途，保持着她的纯洁和宁静冉冉地消逝在坟场，只留给他几朵白花，让他去遐思，追悔！这鞭挞的力量是沉重的，向人们展示了什么是善什么是恶，良善和美好如何不朽，而不义和丑恶只能在坟前承受良心的谴责！
    这是一首凄迷但却宁静的诗，而T·A·齐米娜赋予了这诗篇以更深刻的意义，据说扮演“吉赛尔”是芭蕾舞剧女演员的严格考验，因为它要求高超的舞蹈艺术，要求演员善于用舞蹈来巧妙地、细致地表达女主人公的内心感受，我想，齐米娜是无愧于这一考验的。
