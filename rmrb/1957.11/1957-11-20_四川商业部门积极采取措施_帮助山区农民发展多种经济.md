Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 18th - Sichuan Province's commercial departments are actively taking measures to help mountain farmers develop diverse economies.
　　The Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative has organized lacquer tapping workers to go to the mountains to teach lacquer tapping techniques in Mianyang, Ya'an, Dazhou and other regions that produce raw lacquer. In the past, Mianyang region only produced 60,000 to 70,000 jin of raw lacquer annually. This year, after mastering new lacquer tapping techniques, the output of mountain farmers has risen to 200,000 jin. The Chinese herbal medicine management departments in Wenjiang and Wanxian regions organized more than 6,000 medicinal herb farmers and hunters to go into the mountains to dig for herbs and hunt. Supply and marketing departments in various places have also gone deep into the mountains to hold commodity exhibitions, introducing the products they purchase and opening up sales channels for mountain specialty products.
　　In order to support the development of production in mountainous areas, commercial departments have also made reasonable adjustments to the purchase prices of some major products in mountainous areas. For example, in southern and eastern Sichuan, which are rich in gallnuts, it is expected that gallnut production will be reduced due to disasters this year, and only more than 18,000 dan can be purchased. Due to the adjustment of purchase prices, many farmers are actively going into the mountains to collect them, and more than 22,000 dan have already been purchased. The price of *tangpian* in Dazhou region was originally very low, and farmers were unwilling to go into the mountains to cut it. Now, after adjusting the purchase price, the output has also increased by more than double.
　　Commercial workers sent to the mountains for investigation feel that the mountains have great development prospects. The Sichuan Provincial Service Hall conducted a survey in the mountainous areas of southern Sichuan and proved that the development prospects for pigs, livestock, and poultry are very great. They discovered more than 30 kinds of wild feed in Gong County alone. As for some non-staple foods supplied to urban and rural areas, such as daylilies, tree ears, and peppercorns, as long as production is rationally organized, the output can be increased by one or two times within a few years. There are also many wild plants in the mountains that can be used for brewing wine and extracting oil. According to preliminary investigations, just the raw materials for brewing wine such as *qinggangzi* and kudzu root can be purchased more than 100 million jin annually if the masses are mobilized to collect them.

    四川商业部门积极采取措施
    帮助山区农民发展多种经济
    新华社成都18日电　四川省商业部门积极采取措施，帮助山区农民发展多种经济。
    省供销合作社先后在盛产生漆的绵阳、雅安、达县等专区，组织割漆工人上山传授割漆技术。绵阳专区过去年产生漆只六、七万斤，今年山区农民在掌握新的割漆技术以后，产量已上升到二十万斤。温江、万县两个专区中药材经营部门，今年组织了六千多药农、猎手上山挖药、打猎。各地供销部门还深入山区举办商品展览会，介绍收购的产品，为山区土特产品打开销路。
    为了扶植山区生产发展，商业部门对山区一些主要产品，在收购价格上也作了合理调整。如盛产五倍子的川南和川东地区，预计今年五倍子受灾减产，只能收购一万八千多担，由于调整了收购价格，许多农民都踊跃上山采集，现在已经收购到二万二千多担。达县专区的棠片，原来价格很低，农民都不愿上山割取，现在调整收购价格以后，产量也增加一倍以上。
    各个派到山区调查的商业工作人员，都感到山区有很大的发展前途。四川省服务厅在川南山区调查，证明当地生猪、牲畜和家禽的发展前途很大。他们仅在珙县一地发现的野生饲料就有三十多种。至于一些供应城乡食用的副食品，如黄花、木耳、花椒等，只要合理组织生产，几年内产量就可增加一两倍。山区可供酿酒、榨油的野生植物也很多，其中仅青杠籽、葛根等酿酒原料，据初步调查，只要发动群众采集，每年就可收购一亿斤以上。
