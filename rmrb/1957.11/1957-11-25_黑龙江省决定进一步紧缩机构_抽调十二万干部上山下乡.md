Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 23rd - Heilongjiang Province has decided to further reduce its staff by 30% to 50% on the basis of streamlining its organizations in the first half of this year. In this way, the province will transfer at least 120,000 cadres to lower levels, most of whom will go to the countryside to participate in agricultural production. This was proposed by Qiang Xiaochu, Secretary of the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, in a report to the Party members' meeting of directly subordinate organizations of the province on the 22nd.

Although Heilongjiang Province had already transferred 26,000 cadres to lower levels this spring, the province's agencies, enterprises, and institutions still suffer from bloated organizations, overlapping layers, over-detailed division of labor, and a serious phenomenon of overstaffing. In his report, Qiang Xiaochu demanded that all units, when streamlining their organizations, should assign personnel according to tasks, and oppose assigning tasks according to personnel. He also asked leading cadres of all units to overcome ideological obstacles such as fearing that there would be fewer people and the work would not be done well. They should personally take the lead and conduct full and frank discussions with the masses to formulate and discuss reorganization plans; at the same time, conduct in-depth and thorough ideological work in the organs, so that cadres regard participating in labor as a glorious thing and happily go to the countryside.

The provincial direct organs, which are at the forefront of the rectification campaign in the province, have already had more than 30 units move into the stage of focusing on rectification and reform, setting off a high tide of signing up to participate in agricultural production. The number of people in the Department of Civil Affairs, the Department of Supervision, and the Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League who signed up to go to the countryside reached 98% to 100%. Some cadres have already discussed with their families and made preparations to go to the countryside. According to the demands of the masses, the Provincial Department of Agriculture decided to transfer 50% of its existing personnel to lower levels. The Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League has merged its original seven departments and one office into four departments, transferring 45% of its cadres to lower levels, and has approved a deputy secretary and thirteen ministers to go to the grassroots to work or participate in production. The Department of Commerce has also transferred more than 530 people to the forest area to participate in production.

    黑龙江省决定进一步紧缩机构
    抽调十二万干部上山下乡
    新华社哈尔滨23日电　黑龙江省决定在今年上半年紧缩机构的基础上，再紧缩人员30％到50％，这样全省至少将抽调十二万名干部下放，其中绝大部分将上山下乡参加农业生产，这是中共黑龙江省委书记强晓初22日在省直属机关党员大会上作报告时提出的。
    黑龙江省虽然在今年春季已经抽调二万六千名干部下放，但全省各机关、企业、事业等单位机构臃肿、层次重叠、分工过细，人浮于事的现象还很严重。强晓初在报告中要求各单位在紧缩机构时，要以事设人，反对以人设事。并要求各单位领导干部要克服怕人少工作不好做等思想障碍。要亲自动手和群众一起鸣放，拟定和讨论整编方案；同时在机关中进行深入的、透彻的思想工作，使干部把参加劳动看成是光荣的事情，愉快地到农村去。
    走在全省整风最前面的省直属机关，已经有三十多个单位转入着重整改阶段，掀起了报名参加农业生产的高潮。民政厅、监察厅、共青团省委报名下乡的人达百分之九十八到百分之一百。有的干部已和家庭商量好并做好了下乡上山的准备。省农业厅根据群众要求，决定从现有人员中抽调50％下放，共青团省委已将原有七个部一个办公室合并为四个部，下放干部45％，并已批准了一个副书记和十三个部长下放到基层工作或参加生产。商业厅也已下放五百三十多人到林区参加生产。
