Fabricating Facts to Attack the Party
Liu Shengya's True Colors Fully Exposed

    (Our report) The anti-communist conspiracy of the self-proclaimed "recluse" and "writer" Liu Shengya has been exposed. He turns out to be an important figure in the China Democratic League's Chongqing rightist group. Liu Shengya described the literary and art circles under the leadership of the Party as "pitch black" and believed that "things are not as good after liberation as before liberation." He slandered the Party's leadership of literary and art work as a cannibalistic "sectarian rule." At the Chongqing literary and art circles' forum, he questioned the Party with sixteen consecutive "whys?", such as asking: "Why let some people with little knowledge or even those who are incompetent lead the cause of various departments of literature and art?" etc., using the excuse that "laymen cannot lead experts" in an attempt to usurp the Party's leadership over literary and art undertakings. Liu Shengya fabricated so-called "prominent examples" of sectarianism that "happened in more than a hundred cases" and said: "This kind of sectarianism is by no means against me alone, but against several people," attempting to instigate many people to attack the leadership of the Party.

    Liu Shengya is the author of the reactionary novel "Record of Rebirth." This novel, which defends counter-revolutionaries, was published during the vigorous suppression of counter-revolutionaries in 1951 and was severely condemned and criticized by people from all walks of life in Chongqing. During this blooming and contending period, Liu Shengya fiercely counterattacked this criticism, clamoring to make a big issue of reversing the verdict on "Record of Rebirth."

    Liu Shengya is a "special member" of the China Democratic League, added to the league according to the Zhang-Luo alliance's great development plan. He is also the deputy director of the Literary and Art Work Committee of the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League. This organization was also established before and after the blooming and contending period according to the reactionary plan of the Zhang-Luo alliance.

    捏造事实对党攻击
    刘盛亚真面目全部暴露
    本报讯　自称“隐士”的“作家”刘盛亚反共阴谋已被揭穿，原来他是民盟重庆右派集团的一员重要角色。刘盛亚把党领导的文艺界说成“漆黑一团”，认为“解放后不如解放前好”，诬蔑党对文艺工作的领导是吃人的“宗派统治”。他在重庆文艺界鸣放座谈会上，一连向党质问了十六个“为什么？”，例如问：“为什么让一些知识很少乃至不学无术的人来领导文学艺术各个部门的事业”等等，借口“外行不能领导内行”，企图篡夺党对文艺事业的领导。刘盛亚捏造所谓“发生了一百多件”宗派的“突出事例”，并说：“这种宗派绝不是对我一人，而是对若干人”，企图煽动许多人起来攻击党的领导。
    刘盛亚是反动小说“再生记”的作者，这部为反革命分子辩护的小说发表在1951年轰轰烈烈镇压反革命时期，受到重庆各方面人士严厉的谴责和批判。这次鸣放中刘盛亚气势汹汹地对这次批判进行反扑，大肆叫嚣要把“再生记”的翻案问题闹大。
    刘盛亚是按章罗联盟大发展计划加人民盟的“特殊盟员”，是民盟重庆市委机关文艺工作委员会的副主任委员，这个机构也是按章罗联盟反动计划在大鸣大放前后建立起来的。
