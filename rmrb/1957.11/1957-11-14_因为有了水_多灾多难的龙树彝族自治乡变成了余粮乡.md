Because of Water
——The Disaster-ridden Longshu Yi Autonomous Township Transformed into a Surplus Grain Township
	Zhang Jiechun
	The heavy ears of grain no longer sway in the wind as they once did, and the rows of terraced fields have turned from green to golden yellow. The season for crop maturity has arrived. Men from Longshu Yi Autonomous Township carry poles and women carry baskets, busily working in the fields. The elderly praise this year's crops, saying it's "a good harvest they never dreamed of." Seeing the abundant harvest, people are all talking about water, the water that has been accumulated, which has created such a miracle: this year's rice production will more than double that before liberation!
	Who would have thought that just two years ago, this Longshu Yi Autonomous Township was a notoriously poor mountainous area in Yuxi County, Yunnan. The suffering brought by drought was almost unbearable. But now, this poor mountainous area has been transformed into a surplus grain township.
	In the past, the rainfall here wasn't less than in other places, but it just couldn't be retained. Heavy rain brought floods, and light rain brought small floods. After the rain, even drinking water had to be carried from the mountain streams in the lowlands; after more sunny days, fetching water became even more laborious.
	Even more frightening was the damage to production. When it was time to transplant seedlings, there was a lack of water. People carried water from the mountain streams every day to pour on the fields. Sometimes there was no water to carry, and the sky didn't rain, so they had to watch the seedlings wither and die, waiting for a chance to sow a second time. In the three years of 1948, 1949, and 1950, more than half of the rice paddies were simply sown with dry seedlings. Finally, a rain came, and everyone quickly turned the fields and transplanted the seedlings. But before they could transplant much, the water ran out again, so they had to wait for the next rain... In this way, every year they had to transplant seedlings around the middle of the fourth month of the lunar calendar, and wouldn't finish until the end of May, sometimes even dragging on until June. Because the planting was too late, the average yield per mu never exceeded two hundred jin. Even worse, the transplanted seedlings were then hit by drought. This happened in 1953. At that time, Longshu Township had only organized mutual aid teams, and water conservancy hadn't been developed much. The peasants had transplanted three hundred mu of seedlings early on the 15th of the fourth month of the lunar calendar, but after that, it didn't rain. They first carried water to pour on the fields, and then cut thatch and leaves to lay on the rice paddies, but in the end, they were still scorched to death by the sun.
	Before liberation, only twenty-eight households of landlords and rich peasants in Longshu Township's three hundred and twenty-seven households had surplus grain, and another twenty-seven middle peasant households barely had enough to eat. The remaining eighty-two households had enough grain to last until the New Year, while the other one hundred plus households could only eat until the end of the autumn harvest. Living such a life, there was no strength to repair dams and ponds. They barely repaired some small ones, which weren't very effective. In the year before liberation, the whole township had only one large dam and sixty small dams, which could only irrigate one hundred and fifty mu, accounting for 11.7% of the total rice field area at that time. Most of these dams were owned by landlords and rich peasants.
	After the land reform in 1952, life was a little better. The Yi people were able to spend some effort repairing and building dams and ponds. But until 1955, the irrigated area was still only four hundred mu. In 1956, advanced cooperatives were established. The Party branch analyzed the township's characteristics of having a wide area, barren soil, and water shortage, but the soil was conducive to building dams and storing water. They realized that to change the poor face of the mountainous area, they had to vigorously develop water conservancy. In one year, the whole township built a total of two hundred and sixty-three large and small dams, expanding the irrigated area to eight hundred mu. The peasants' slogans were "How high the fields are, how high the water is" and "Don't waste a drop of water." According to the specific situation, they dug ponds on the hillsides and built dams in the mountain gullies. Because of the increased water, the agricultural cooperative unprecedentedly advanced the planting time to the end of March. Coupled with the rain, 70% of the rice was planted on time, and the rest was planted before the end of April. In 1956, rice production generally increased, with an average yield of three hundred and sixty-nine jin per mu, an increase of 84.5% compared to 1949. The total grain output increased by more than 150,000 jin compared to 1955. The grain-deficient township was transformed into a surplus grain township, selling more than 93,000 jin of surplus grain.
	The bumper harvest changed the lives of the people in Longshu Township. The days of eating wild mountain herbs and sleeping by the fire pit are gone forever, and the tattered trousers that couldn't cover the body no longer need to be worn. The township's supply and marketing cooperative made great efforts to meet the needs of the people, but it was often unable to meet the demand. According to a survey of Xiaoba Village, the village with the largest population in the township, all one hundred and five households in the village bought flashlights, and some households even had three. In the past, even landlords and rich peasants only made one new set of clothes per household per year, but this year they made an average of two sets per household. All seventy-plus young adults in the village have a set of khaki Zhongshan suits.
	The harvest of 1956 gave everyone greater confidence. The Party branch used the method of recalling the past and comparing it with the present to make everyone more aware of the necessity of developing water conservancy. In addition to the water conservancy groups in each production team that managed dams, blocked dams, and repaired small dams, the agricultural cooperative also organized a permanent professional water conservancy team of one hundred and twenty people, specializing in building larger dams. Since last winter, this professional water conservancy team has completed six larger projects, building and repairing two hundred small dams ranging from two to four mu. The funds used to build these projects were raised by themselves, without asking the state for money.
	Because there was little rain last year, and it was relatively dry this spring, only nine hundred and sixty-five mu were irrigated during this year's spring plowing, accounting for 58% of the rice area. However, based on the current harvesting situation, the average yield per mu in the township can still reach four hundred and twenty jin. It is estimated that the total surplus grain in the township this year will reach nearly 200,000 jin. Because of water conservancy, economic crops such as flue-cured tobacco have also been developed. There were none in the past, but this year 571 mu were planted.
	Water conservancy construction in Longshu Township is developing rapidly. By 1958, all fields will have dams. By 1959, the goal is to ensure that all rice fields can be transplanted on time even in severe drought. By then, this "poor mountainous area" will be a rich water town with sparkling lakes.

    因为有了水
    ——多灾多难的龙树彝族自治乡变成了余粮乡
    章皆淳
    沉甸甸的谷穗已不再像过去那样随风摆动，一溜溜的梯田已经由绿色变为金黄。庄稼成熟的季节来到了。龙树彝族自治乡男的挑着担子，女的背着背箩，奔忙在田野里。年老的夸着今年的庄稼，说是“做梦也没想到过的好年景”。看到丰收景象，人们都在谈论着水，就是那些积起来的水，造成了这样的奇迹：今年的水稻产量将比解放前增加一倍多！
    有谁想到，就在两年前，这个龙树彝族自治乡，还是云南玉溪县一个出名的穷山区。干旱带来的苦难，逼得人们简直喘不过气来。而现在，这个穷山区却已变为余粮乡。
    在过去，这里的雨水倒也不比别处少下，可就是存不住，下大雨就发大水，下小雨就发小水。雨过了，连吃水都要到低处的山箐里去挑；多晴些日子，吃水就更成为颇花劳力的大事。
    更可怕的是生产遭受的灾害。该撒秧了，可是缺少水。人们天天到山箐里挑水来泼。有时水也没地方挑了，天还不下雨，就只好眼看着秧苗枯死，等机会再撒第二次种。在1948、1949、1950三年中，有大半的秧田，干脆就撒旱秧。好容易盼来了一阵雨，大家赶紧翻田栽秧。但没栽上多少，水又跑光了，于是又再等下一阵雨……。就这样，每年总要到旧历4月中旬才栽秧，5月底才栽完，有时还要拖到6月。因为种得太迟，每亩平均产量一直不超过二百斤。更糟糕的是栽下秧又遭旱。1953年就是这样。那时，龙树乡才组织了互助组，水利还没怎样搞起来。农民们提前在旧历4月15日栽下了三百亩秧，可是以后就是不下雨。他们先是挑水泼，后来又割了茅草、树叶铺在稻田里，结果还是被晒枯掉。
    在解放前，龙树乡三百二十七户人家中只有二十八户地主富农有余粮，还有二十七户中农粮食勉强够吃。余下的有八十二户粮食能吃到过年，另外那一百多户则只能吃到秋收末。过着这样的生活，那里有力量修坝塘，勉强修了些小的，也不很顶事。解放前一年，全乡只有一个大坝塘、六十个小坝塘，仅能灌溉一百五十亩，占当时稻田总面积的11．7％。这些坝塘，还多是地主富农的。
    1952年实行土地改革后，日子好过些了。彝族人民才能花一些力量来整修、兴修坝塘。但是直到1955年，灌溉面积也还只有四百亩。1956年成立了高级社，党支部分析了本乡地广、土瘦、水缺，但是土质利于打坝蓄水的特点，认识到要改变山区贫困面貌，就必须大力搞水利。一年中，全乡共修了大小坝塘二百六十三个，灌溉面积扩大到八百亩。农民们的口号是“田有多高，水有多高”“不浪费一滴水”。依照具体情况，在山坡上挖塘，在山沟里拦坝。由于有了较多的水，农业社破天荒地把栽种时间提前到3月下旬，再加上雨水，70％的稻谷都按时栽种，其余的也都在4月底以前栽下。1956年稻谷普遍增产，平均每亩产三百六十九斤，比1949年增加84．5％。粮食总产量比1955年增产十五万多斤，缺粮乡一变而为余粮乡，卖出余粮九万三千多斤。
    大丰收改变了龙树乡人民的生活面貌，吃山茅野菜、睡火塘觉的日子已一去不复返了，破得不能蔽体的裤子再也用不着穿了。乡里的供销社用了很大的努力去满足人民的需要，还往往供不应求。根据乡里户口最多的小坝村的调查，全村一百零五户，每户都买了手电，有的还一户有三个。过去连地主富农在内，平均每户每年才做一套新衣，今年平均每户做了两套。全村七十多个青壮年，每人都有一套卡叽中山服。
    1956年的丰收使大家树立了更大的信心。党支部用回忆对比的办法使大家更明确了搞水利的必要。农业社除了各生产队都有管理坝塘、堵坝和整修小型坝塘的水利小组外，还组织了一个一百二十人的常年专业水利队，专门兴修较大的坝塘。自去冬到现在，这个专业水利队完成了六项较大的工程，兴修、整修二亩到四亩的小型坝塘二百个。他们兴修这些工程，所用的经费，是由自己设法解决的，没有向国家要过钱。
    因为去年雨下得少，加上今春又比较干燥，今年春耕中只灌溉了九百六十五亩，占水稻面积的58％。不过根据目前正在收割的情形来看，全乡平均每亩产量还是能达到四百二十斤。估计今年全乡余粮将达近二十万斤。因为有了水利，还发展了经济作物，如烤烟，过去是没有的，今年种了五百七十一亩。
    龙树乡的水利建设正在大步地发展着。到1958年，所有的田都将有坝塘。到1959年，要做到在严重干旱的情况下使全部稻田按时栽秧。到那时，他们这个“穷山区”，将是一个湖光点点的富饶的水乡了。
