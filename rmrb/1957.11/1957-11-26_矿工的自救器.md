    Miner's Self-Rescuer
    A "filtering self-rescuer" that ensures coal miners can safely escape in the event of gas or fire accidents underground has recently been successfully trial-produced in Fushun. With this self-rescuer, if miners encounter gas or fire accidents underground, they can put it on immediately and breathe fresh air for forty-five minutes, preventing poisoning. This allows them to safely evacuate the disaster area.
    The filtering self-rescuer was made by the Fushun Coal Research Institute and Coal Mine Safety Instrument Factory, imitating Soviet products and after dozens of tests.

    矿工的自救器
    一种保证煤矿工人在井下遇到瓦斯或火灾事故可以安全脱险的“滤过式自救器”，最近在抚顺试制成功。有了这种自救器，矿工在井下如果遇到瓦斯或火灾事故，马上把它带好，就能够在四十五分钟内呼吸到新鲜空气，不致中毒。这就可以安全脱离灾区。
    滤过式自救器是抚顺煤炭科学研究院和煤矿安全仪器厂仿造苏联产品，经过几十次试验才制成的。
