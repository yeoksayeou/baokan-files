The water source area of Yingkou County, Liaoning Province, used to suffer from the frequent disasters of the Liao River flooding. For ten years, there would be nine years of waterlogging, and tens of thousands of mu of cultivated land would yield nothing each year. After liberation, under the leadership of the People's Government, the local farmers carried out the work of building farmland water conservancy. They built a Limin River, 80 miles long, running through three townships, and expanded and repaired four tributaries of the Liao River. On these five rivers, they built 74 large and small water gates and 33 pumping stations, achieving "no flooding in heavy rain and no drought without rain," ensuring production and harvest. This year, due to conquering the drought, the total output of water and dry land in the entire area reached more than 80 million catties. The production and living standards of all 36 agricultural cooperatives in the area have surpassed those of the local well-to-do middle peasants. The picture shows the members of the agricultural cooperative returning happily from the harvest.

    水利带来的幸福
    辽宁省营口县水源区过去经常受到辽河泛滥的灾害，十年九涝，十几万亩耕田中，每年都有几万亩颗粒不收。解放后，在人民政府的领导下，当地农民开展了兴修农田水利工作，修了一条长达八十里、贯穿三个乡的利民河，并扩修了四条辽河支流，在这五条河坝上修建了大大小小七十四座水闸和三十三座抽水站，做到了“大雨不泛、无雨不旱”，保产保收。今年由于征服了旱灾，全区水旱田总产量达到八千多万斤。全区三十六个农业社的生产和社员的生活水平都超过了当地富裕中农的水平。图为农业社的社员们，愉快地收割归来。
