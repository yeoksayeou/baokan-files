Xinhua News Agency, November 15th: Zhang Zhixiang, Vice Minister of Culture, held a banquet in Beijing at noon on November 15th to welcome the Yugoslav "Branko Krsmanović" Song and Dance Troupe.

Miloš Nikolić, head of the song and dance troupe, Miotrag Pavlović, deputy head, and all 41 members of the troupe were invited to attend the banquet.

At the banquet, Zhang Zhixiang said that the Yugoslav "Kolo" Folk Song and Dance Troupe visited China in 1955 and was warmly welcomed. Some Yugoslav folk songs and dances have been widely circulated in China or included in performance programs. He believed that the "Branko Krsmanović" Song and Dance Troupe's visit to China this time would also be a great success.

Miloš Nikolić, head of the song and dance troupe, said that their song and dance troupe is part of the Belgrade "Branko Krsmanović" student art society, and the members are all university students. They will perform a portion of the art programs they rehearsed in their spare time, so that the Chinese audience can have a general impression of the cultural creation and people's lives of the Yugoslav people.

At the banquet, Milicevic, Chargé d'Affaires ad interim of the Yugoslav Embassy in China, and Wu Xiuquan, Chinese Ambassador to Yugoslavia, also spoke. They both expressed their hope that the cultural relations and other aspects of relations between China and Yugoslavia would be further strengthened and developed.

Representatives from the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Youth League, the All-China Student Federation, and the Beijing Student Federation spoke at the banquet, expressing a warm welcome to the song and dance troupe for performing for Chinese youth and students first.

At the banquet, Miloš Nikolić, head of the song and dance troupe, presented gifts to the hosts. The troupe members also performed choruses and some beautiful Yugoslav folk songs and folk music.
