Thoughts on Reading "Cow Tails and Other Things"

    After reading the article "Cow Tails and Other Things" published in the People's Daily on September 16, 1957, one can't help but find the way this "judge" in Sichuan handled the case of unlawful landlords harming oxen both laughable and absurd. I believe this is a problem that deserves deep thought from every one of our political and legal cadres.

    This shows that currently, some of our political and legal cadres have a very superficial understanding of Chairman Mao's report "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," and they cannot distinguish between the nature of two different kinds of contradictions. Sometimes they even mistake contradictions between the enemy and ourselves for contradictions among the people.

    When bourgeois right-wingers took advantage of the Party's rectification campaign to launch a frenzied attack on our Party, some unlawful landlords, rich peasants, and remaining counter-revolutionaries in the countryside also seized the opportunity to become active. They were cooperating with the right-wingers in fighting, attacking the socialist positions in the countryside. An unlawful landlord in Mading Township, Chuxian County, even gloated in August, shouting wildly, "Let's do it! Our time has come!" Although the battlefields were different, one in the city and one in the countryside, they were echoing each other from afar, and their goals were the same, all dreaming of the restoration of capitalism in China.

    As the weapon of the people's democratic dictatorship—the state's political and legal organs—in this serious life-and-death struggle against the right-wingers, some places and some aspects have shown weakness and even lost their function. Some cadres in the political and legal departments have serious right-leaning thoughts, appearing incompetent in the face of the enemy, losing their power, and having a numb and indifferent complacent attitude. The "judge" in Sichuan is not without "comrades" in various places.

    One political and legal cadre even has the viewpoint of "solely relying on confessions," insisting that only when the prisoner so-called "confesses without reservation" is the "whole case clear." They arbitrarily negate the materials reported by the masses. In their view, if a prisoner is found guilty of a few more crimes or sentenced to two more years, that is called a "wrong case." It is considered reasonable to allow the guilty to go unpunished or to exonerate criminals.

    There seems to be less interest in investigating cases of light sentences for serious crimes than in investigating cases of heavy sentences for minor crimes. It seems that leaning a little to the left is deviating, while leaning a little to the right doesn't matter. A responsible cadre in a grassroots political and legal department not only recognizes this but has already been doing it.

    Making excuses for criminals in many ways is truly a case of "if you want to reduce the crime, you'll never be short of words." For example, for thieves, if they steal many times but the amount is small, it is called "minor crime"; if they steal few times but the amount is large, it is called "accidental offense." If they are young, it is called "ignorance," and if they are over fifty, they are of course "old." What about middle-aged people? There are also cases of "better confession," and so on, endlessly. I wonder if the enemy will be so considerate of us when they attack us.

    The above examples are a series of feelings that arose after reading this essay. There are indeed many problems in the thinking of our political and legal cadres. The existence of these problems means that some people are not even consciously examining themselves, causing invisible losses to the work of the Party and the state, invisibly condoning the enemy, and harming our own people.

    I am willing to always remember the lesson of the "judge" in Sichuan, otherwise, unknowingly, my ears will be cut off by the masses.

### 读“牛尾巴及其他”有感

    读“牛尾巴及其他”有感
    1957年9月16日人民日报上发表了一篇“牛尾巴及其他”的文章，读后不禁使人对四川这位“法官”处理不法地主暗害耕牛的案件感到啼笑皆非。我认为：这是值得我们每一个政法干部深思的问题。
    这说明了目前在我们某些政法干部中，对毛主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的报告学习得肤浅得很，划不清两类不同矛盾的性质。有时甚至误认敌我矛盾为人民内部矛盾。
    当着资产阶级右派分子借着帮助党整风的机会向我党发动疯狂进攻的时候，农村中一些不法地主、富农、残余的反革命分子都乘机而起，活跃起来了。他们在配合右派分子作战，向农村社会主义阵地进攻。滁县马丁乡有一个不法地主在8月间曾得意忘形的在狂叫“干吧！我们的时机到了！”作战的阵地虽然不同，一在城市，一在农村，但他们是在遥相呼应，目的是一致的，都在梦想资本主义在中国复辟。
    作为人民民主专政的武器——国家政法机关，在这一场严重的你死我活的反右派斗争中，某些地方某些方面却表现得软弱无力，甚至丧失自己的职能。政法部门中的一些干部，则存在着严重的右倾思想，在敌人的面前表现得无能，失去了威力，有麻木不仁的太平观念。像四川这位“法官”，在各地不是没有“同志”的。
    有一位政法干部还有“唯口供论”的观点，他一定要被犯人所谓“供认不讳”的时候，这才是“全案大白”。对群众的检举材料，却任意否定。在他看来，对犯人多认定了几条罪恶，或者多判了两年，这就叫“错案”。有罪的逍遥法外，或替犯罪分子开脱罪责，倒是理所当然的。
    对重罪轻判的并不像轻罪重判的检查得那样有兴趣。似乎左一点，偏了；右一些，倒无关系。有一个基层政法部门的负责干部，不但是这样认识的，而且早已在这样做了。
    多方面为犯罪分子开脱罪责，真是“欲减其罪，何患无词”。例如，对偷窃犯，偷的次数多，数量少，这叫“罪情轻微”；偷的次数少数量多，这叫“偶犯”。年纪轻的这叫“无知”，五十多岁的当然是“年迈”了。中年人呢！也有“坦白较好”，如是等等，不一而足。不知敌人在向我们进攻的时候，是否也会为我们设想得这么周到。
    以上数例，是读过这篇杂文后而引起的一连串的感觉。当前在我们政法干部的思想上确存在不少的问题。这些问题的存在，有的还不能自觉的去检查自己，使党和国家的工作无形中遭到了损失，无形中宽纵了敌人而残害了自己的人民。
    我愿永远记住四川这位“法官”的教训，否则在不知不觉之中，自己的耳朵是会被群众割掉的。
