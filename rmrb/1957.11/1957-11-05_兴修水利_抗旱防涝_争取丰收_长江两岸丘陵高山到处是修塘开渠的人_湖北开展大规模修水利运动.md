Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 4th. A water conservancy movement for farmland that is larger in scale than in previous years has been widely launched in rural Hubei Province. On the fertile banks of the Yangtze River, or in hilly and mountainous areas, people are scattered everywhere building ponds, digging canals, excavating ditches, and building dams. They are striving to continue expanding and improving the irrigated area by ten million mu on the basis of the original irrigation, increasing the area of guaranteed-harvest fields by four million mu, converting 750,000 mu of dry land into paddy fields, and expanding the cultivated area by 800,000 mu.

According to the habits of previous years, Hubei's farmland water conservancy projects would not start until after November, but this year they started as early as September. In the Ebei area, Guanghua, Junxian, and Zhaoyang counties have built more than 10,000 large and small irrigation projects during this period, which not only solves the problem of irrigation water for winter sowing, but can also convert about 100,000 mu of dry land into paddy fields. Among them, Junxian alone has converted more than 24,000 mu of dry land into paddy fields, exceeding 20% of this winter's plan. In the Edong area, which is rich in grain and cotton, while building several large-scale irrigation projects, it is vigorously renovating and strengthening the existing water conservancy facilities and rationally adjusting the irrigation system. In the areas along the river and near the lake, drainage and desalination work is underway. The Enshi mountainous area in western Hubei, which is progressing slowly, is expected to see a large-scale upsurge in farmland water conservancy construction in mid-November.

The attention and personal involvement of party organizations at all levels is an important factor in the early arrival of the mass upsurge in farmland water conservancy construction. As early as the beginning of September, Hubei Province convened a provincial water conservancy conference to discuss and deploy the water conservancy work for this winter and next spring. Afterwards, special districts, counties, and even townships and communes, focused on farmland water conservancy construction and conducted specific studies and arrangements.

In addition, Hubei Province has also adopted methods such as visits and exchange of experiences to overcome the conservative thinking and complacency of some cadres. From mid-September, Xiangyang Special District organized the county party secretaries, water conservancy cadres, and some township and commune cadres to visit Junxian and Guanghua counties successively. After the visit, the cadres revised the water conservancy plan based on the characteristics of their own regions. The special district originally planned to convert 500,000 mu of dry land into paddy fields this winter and next spring, but now it has increased to 700,000 mu, and the guaranteed-harvest fields have also increased from 600,000 mu to 1 million mu.

### 兴修水利　抗旱防涝　争取丰收  长江两岸丘陵高山到处是修塘开渠的人  湖北开展大规模修水利运动

    兴修水利　抗旱防涝　争取丰收
    长江两岸丘陵高山到处是修塘开渠的人
    湖北开展大规模修水利运动
    据新华社武汉4日电　一个规模比往年大得多的兴修农田水利的运动，已经在湖北省农村广泛展开。在富饶的长江两岸，或是丘陵高山地区，到处散布着修塘、开渠、挖沟、筑坝的人。他们力争在原有灌溉的基础上，继续扩大和改善灌溉面积一千万亩，增加保收田四百万亩，旱地改水田七十五万亩，扩大耕地面积八十万亩。
    按照往年的习惯，湖北的农田水利工程要在11月份以后才开始动工，而今年早在9月份就动起手来了。鄂北地区的光化、均县、枣阳等县，在这期间兴修的大小灌溉工程达一万多处，不仅解决了冬播灌溉用水，还能改旱地为水田十万亩左右。其中仅均县一地就改旱地为水田二万四千多亩，超过今冬计划的20％。盛产粮棉的鄂东地区，在兴修几个大型灌溉工程的同时，正大力整修加强旧有水利设施，合理调整灌溉系统。沿江滨湖地区，正在进行排水除渍工作。进度较慢的鄂西恩施山区，预计11月中旬也将出现一个大规模兴修农田水利的高潮。
    各级党组织的重视和亲自动手，是群众性的兴修农田水利高潮提早到来的重要因素。早在9月初，湖北省就召开了全省水利会议，讨论、布置了今冬明春的水利工作。以后，各专区、县以至乡、社，都以兴修农田水利为中心，进行了具体研究和安排。
    此外，湖北省还采取参观、交流经验等办法，克服部分干部的保守思想和自满情绪。襄阳专区从9月中旬起组织了各县党委书记、水利干部以及部分乡、社干部，先后到均县、光化县参观。干部们经过参观以后，都纷纷根据本地区的特点，重新修订了水利规划。这个专区原先计划今冬明春改旱地为水田五十万亩，现在增加到七十万亩，保收田也由六十万亩增加到一百万亩。
