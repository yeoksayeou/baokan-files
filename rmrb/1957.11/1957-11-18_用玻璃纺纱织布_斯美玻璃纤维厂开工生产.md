Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, November 17th: The first factory in China to spin glass to weave fabric – the Smei Glass Fiber Factory – officially began production on the morning of the 15th in Shanghai. Strands of glass fiber, as white as snow and finer than silk, continuously emerged from rows of machines, completely identical to the high-grade imported glass fiber.

This factory can produce various acid-resistant, alkali-resistant, and high-temperature resistant products, such as glass yarn, glass cloth, glass rope, and glass tape. The factory is equipped with dozens of spinning machines researched and designed by Chinese technicians themselves, as well as re-fitted doubling frames, looms, and tape weaving machines originally used in cotton textile mills. Next year, the factory's production scale will be several times larger than it is now.

Using glass to spin yarn and weave fabric is a rapidly developing new industry abroad. The yarn and cloth woven from glass are supplied for manufacturing electric motors, generators, fishing nets, and ship cables, and can replace industrial cotton yarn and cotton cloth. It has characteristics such as high-temperature resistance, corrosion resistance, and high tensile strength, which can reduce the size and increase the efficiency of electric motors and generators, and extend the lifespan of fishing nets and ship cables. Glass cloth can also be pressed together with plastic to form fiberglass, which can be used to manufacture boat and car shells, and is more durable than steel.

The main raw material for manufacturing glass yarn and cloth is silica sand, which is inexhaustible and available everywhere. Therefore, technically advanced countries around the world are sparing no effort in researching and developing this industry.

    用玻璃纺纱织布
    斯美玻璃纤维厂开工生产
    据新华社上海17日电　国内第一座用玻璃纺纱织布的工厂——斯美玻璃纤维厂，15日上午在上海正式开工生产。一缕缕像雪一样白，比蚕丝还要细的玻璃丝，连绵不断地从成排的机器里吐出来，它们同进口的高级玻璃丝完全一样。
    这个工厂可以生产各种耐酸、耐碱、耐高温的玻璃纱、玻璃布、玻璃绳和玻璃带等产品。厂里安装着由我国技术人员自己研究设计出来的几十台纺丝机和改装了的棉纺织厂用的并线机、织布机、织带机。明年，这个厂的生产规模比现在还要扩大几倍。
    用玻璃来纺纱织布，在国外还是一个正在大力发展的新兴工业。用玻璃纺织出来的纱布，供给制造电动机、发电机、渔网、船缆，可以代替工业用的棉纱、棉布。它有耐高温、耐腐蚀和拉力强等特性，可以使电动机、发电机体积缩小，效力提高，使渔网、船缆寿命延长。用玻璃布同塑胶一起压制，还可以制成玻璃钢，用来制造船只和汽车外壳，它比钢还要耐用。
    制造玻璃纱布的主要原料是到处取之不尽，用之不竭的矽砂。所以世界技术先进的国家都在不遗余力地研究和发展这项工业。
