    Suggestion to Re-Thresh Rice Straw
    According to my field production inspection in Minfeng Cooperative, Xinming Township, Fuyang County, Zhejiang Province, I found many problems in the rush harvest. For example, when inspecting the six *jian* intercropped paddy fields that had been harvested in Donghuashu, Team Three, a handful of rice straw still contained more than one or two *liang* of rice. We re-threshed the rice straw from those six *fen*, and actually obtained seven *jin* and seven *liang* of dry grain. Calculated per *mu*, this would be twelve *jin* and six *liang*. On average, each *mu* of field in the entire cooperative has at least five *jin* remaining. This means that the entire cooperative's more than 1,000 *mu* of fields (excluding the more than 300 *mu* threshed with threshing machines) will lose more than 3,000 *jin* of grain. If this calculation is applied to a county, a special district, or a province, the numbers become staggering. I hope that all localities will re-thresh the rice straw that has not been thoroughly threshed, so as to avoid wasting grain.

    建议重新打稻草
    根据我在浙江省富阳县新明乡民丰社的田间生产检查，发现抢收中存在很多问题，如在三小队东华墅已收刈的六分间作稻田上检查，一把稻草就有一两多稻谷，我们把六分的稻草重打了一次实得燥谷七斤七两，以一亩计算就有十二斤六两，全社各块田平均至少每亩剩下的有五斤，这样全社一千多亩田（除三百多亩用打稻机打的外）就要损失三千多斤粮食。把这一笔账按一个县，一个专区，一个省算，数字就惊人了，希望各地把没有打干净的稻草都再重新打一遍，以免糟蹋了粮食。
