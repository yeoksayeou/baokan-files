Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, November 26th: The Foreign Ministry of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement today regarding the negotiations between Japan and South Vietnam on the issue of reparations for war losses. The full text of the statement is as follows:

Recently, the Japanese government and the South Vietnamese regime have held several rounds of negotiations on the issue of Japanese reparations for war losses. Most recently, during his visit to South Vietnam, Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi once again discussed this issue with the South Vietnamese regime. Regarding this issue, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has clearly stated its position in its statements of August 25th and 29th, 1956. Now, the Foreign Ministry of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam deems it necessary to state once again:

During World War II, Japanese troops occupied Indochina, causing significant losses in lives and property to the Vietnamese people from north to south. The Japanese government has a responsibility to compensate the entire Vietnamese people for this enormous loss. All Vietnamese people have the right to demand that the Japanese government compensate for the losses caused by Japanese troops during the war.

It is incorrect for the Japanese government to conduct unilateral negotiations with the South Vietnamese regime on the issue of reparations for war losses. According to the Geneva Accords, the South Vietnamese regime is not qualified to represent the entire Vietnamese people in demanding reparations for war losses from the Japanese government.

The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam declares that if the Japanese government signs any agreement with the South Vietnamese regime regarding reparations for war losses for the whole of Vietnam, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam will never recognize it. The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam reserves the right to demand reparations for war losses from the Japanese government.

### 越南外交部发表声明  抗议日本同南越谈判赔偿

    越南外交部发表声明
    抗议日本同南越谈判赔偿
    新华社河内26日电　越南民主共和国外交部今天就日本同南越之间谈判赔偿战争损失问题发表了声明。声明全文如下：
    近来，日本政府同南越政权就日本赔偿战争损失问题进行过几次谈判。最近，日本首相岸信介在访问南越的时候，又一次同南越政权讨论了这个问题。关于这个问题，越南民主共和国政府在1956年8月25日和29日的声明中，已经清楚地表明了自己的立场。现在，越南民主共和国外交部认为有必要再一次声明：
    日本军队在第二次世界大战期间占领了印度支那，使从北到南的越南人民在生命和财产上受到重大损失。日本政府有责任赔偿越南全国人民的这种巨大损失。全体越南人民有权要求日本政府赔偿日本军队在战争期间所造成的损失。
    日本政府就赔偿战争损失问题同南越政权进行片面的谈判，这是不对的。根据日内瓦协议，南越政权没有资格代表全体越南人民要求日本政府赔偿战争损失。
    越南民主共和国政府宣布：如果日本政府同南越政权就赔偿全越南的战争损失问题签订任何协议，越南民主共和国政府决不予以承认。越南民主共和国政府方面仍然保有要求日本政府赔偿战争损失的权利。
