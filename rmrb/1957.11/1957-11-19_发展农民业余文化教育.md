    Develop Farmers' Spare-Time Cultural Education

    Article 31 of the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) from 1956 to 1967 stipulates: "Starting from 1956, depending on the circumstances in each locality, illiteracy among young and middle-aged people should be basically eliminated within twelve years. Efforts should be made to gradually establish spare-time cultural schools in townships or communes to further improve the cultural level of rural grassroots cadres and farmers."

    Since liberation, farmers' spare-time cultural education work has achieved remarkable results. To date, approximately 20 million farmers nationwide have eliminated illiteracy, about 40 million have transitioned from illiteracy to semi-literacy, and even more have gone from not knowing any characters to knowing some. A number of townships (villages), cooperatives, and production teams have now basically eliminated illiteracy. In addition, with a large number of middle and primary school graduates participating in agricultural production in recent years, the cultural level of rural residents has improved to some extent over the past few years.

    To build a modern agriculture, it is necessary to continue to actively change the backward cultural outlook of the countryside. Currently, most farmers are still illiterate. According to estimates from some areas, 60 to 70 percent of the rural population aged 14 to 40 are still illiterate (or semi-literate), with some areas having even higher rates of illiteracy. This means that the work of eliminating illiteracy still requires great effort. At the same time, to enable farmers who have escaped illiteracy and middle and primary school graduates participating in production to continue learning culture, it is necessary to develop spare-time primary schools where conditions permit, focus on running spare-time middle schools, and establish self-study organizations. Recently, during the discussion of the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) in various regions, they should, in accordance with the spirit of the program and in conjunction with local conditions, make long-term plans for eliminating illiteracy and running spare-time middle and primary schools, or revise the original plans, and incorporate them into the overall agricultural development plan. When formulating or revising this plan, it is necessary to learn from the lessons of the past few years, adopt a positive and pragmatic spirit, oppose both passive conservatism and rash advancement, and strive to make the plan practical and feasible. After the plan is formulated, there must also be practical and specific measures to ensure its implementation.

    The large-scale elimination of illiteracy in vast areas of the country will mainly be carried out during the Second Five-Year Plan period. Doing a good job in farmers' spare-time cultural education this winter and next spring can lay a good foundation for the implementation of the Second Five-Year Plan. This winter and next spring, a large-scale production movement centered on the construction of farmland water conservancy and fertilizer accumulation, as well as a large-scale socialist education, will be universally carried out in rural areas. The central task of the countryside is quite heavy. However, both the leadership of cooperatives and the socialist consciousness and enthusiasm for cultural learning of the peasant masses have greatly improved compared to the past. At the same time, due to the transfer of a large number of government cadres to lower levels, the source of spare-time teachers is increasingly expanding; the experience in carrying out this work is also becoming richer. These are all conducive to carrying out large-scale spare-time cultural education this winter and next spring. Therefore, as long as we can fully utilize these favorable conditions and closely cooperate with the central task, farmers' spare-time cultural education work can be carried out smoothly.

    To do a good job in farmers' spare-time cultural education work, it must be properly coordinated with rural production and other tasks. If these tasks are well coordinated, not only will farmers' spare-time cultural education work be able to proceed normally, but the smooth completion of production and other work can also be promoted through farmers' cultural learning organizations. However, in actual work, some places often squeeze out spare-time cultural education work because they have not made comprehensive plans and appropriate arrangements for various tasks. This is not good. Of course, it is also incorrect to excessively and inappropriately emphasize cultural learning to the point of hindering production or other central tasks. However, because farmers' cultural learning is a regular task, not as urgent as production and central tasks, it often creates the illusion that this matter is optional, and can be done sooner or later. Therefore, it is often easily overlooked and squeezed out. It should be pointed out that to build modern agriculture, it is necessary to improve the cultural level of farmers as quickly as possible. It is not acceptable for farmers to remain illiterate for a long time. Neglecting farmers' spare-time cultural education is detrimental to the development of production.

    Farmers' spare-time cultural education must be closely coordinated with the production movement and socialist education. Therefore, the Party committees and governments at all levels must first make overall plans and unified arrangements for farmers' production and learning (including political learning and cultural learning) and socio-political activities. That is, the farmers' spare time must be planned in a unified manner. This is the key to ensuring that farmers learn culture well. Here, I would like to especially mention the unified arrangement of spare time in townships, cooperatives, and production teams. This winter and next spring, the categories of agricultural production are complex and changes are large, and socialist education and rectification work are also underway. The leaders of townships, cooperatives, and production teams should arrange the time for farmers' cultural learning in a timely and flexible manner according to this situation. For example, during the period of great debate or when some people's production is particularly tight, the time for cultural learning can be reduced, or even temporarily suspended. After this stage is over, normal cultural learning should be quickly resumed. Secondly, the farmers' learning organizations should be fully utilized to carry out socialist education, the political lessons in the people's schools should be strengthened, and the content of the political lessons should be socialist education. The teaching content of cultural lessons can also be appropriately combined with political education. Learning organizations should adapt to the production situation and change with the changes in the production situation. At present, attention should be paid to adopting a combination of decentralized and centralized methods for teaching.

    Farmers' spare-time cultural education work must implement the mass line. According to the requirements of the Agricultural Development Program, the country will eliminate 10 to 20 million illiterates every year in the future, which requires organizing a certain number of people to enroll and persist in learning every year. In some places, the number of illiterates with good learning conditions is decreasing, while the number of people with poor conditions is relatively increasing. In addition, the central tasks in rural areas are relatively heavy this winter and next spring, which requires us to mobilize the masses in depth, rely on the masses, and try to strive for more farmers to participate in spare-time cultural learning. In addition to the Party, government, and cooperatives in rural areas being responsible for mobilizing the masses to participate in spare-time cultural learning, organizations such as the Communist Youth League, the Women's Federation, and the Anti-Illiteracy Association should also assume this task well. In terms of methods, it is not enough to limit ourselves to general publicity and mobilization; we must carry out meticulous organizational work, and plan to unite a group of activists in learning, teaching, and running schools, and through them, widely and deeply carry out propaganda and education to the masses, mobilize the masses to enroll and persist in learning. For some things related to learning, we must consult with the masses and let them do it themselves. The responsibility of the leadership lies only in understanding the ideological emotions and difficulties of the masses in learning at any time, carrying out enlightenment education, encouraging and supporting them, and helping them solve the difficulties in learning in a timely manner.

    Winter has arrived. It is hoped that all localities will make good use of the time this winter and next spring to effectively and rapidly launch farmers' spare-time cultural education work.

### 发展农民业余文化教育

    发展农民业余文化教育
    1956年到1967年全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）第三十一条规定：“从一九五六年开始，按照各地情况，分别在十二年内，基本上扫除青年和壮年中的文盲。争取在乡或者社逐步设立业余文化学校，以便进一步提高农村基层干部和农民的文化水平。”
    解放以来，农民业余文化教育工作，获得了显著的成绩。到目前为止，全国已有两千万左右的农民扫除了文盲，大约有四千万左右的人由文盲成为半文盲，还有更多的人由原来不识字到识了一些字。现在已有一批乡（村）、合作社、生产队基本上扫除了文盲。再加上几年来大量的中、小学毕业生参加农业生产，农村居民的文化水平过去几年中已经有了一定的提高。
    为了建设现代化的农业，今后必须继续积极地改变农村文化落后的面貌。现在，大多数农民仍然处于文盲状态。根据一些地区的估计，现在十四到四十岁的农村人口中，仍有百分之六、七十的文盲（半文盲），某些地区文盲还更多一些。这就是说，扫除文盲的工作仍然要用极大的努力来进行。与此同时，为了使部分摆脱文盲状态的农民和参加生产的中、小学毕业生有可能继续学习文化，还必须根据条件，发展业余小学，重点举办业余中学，并且建立自学组织。最近期间，各地在讨论全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）的时候，应该根据纲要的精神，结合本地具体情况，对于扫除文盲、举办业余中、小学，作出长远的规划，或者修订原来的规划，并且把它列入农业发展的总规划中。在制订或修订这个规划的时候，要吸取几年来的教训，要采取积极的实事求是的精神，既反对消极保守思想，又反对急躁冒进的做法，尽力使规划切实可行。规划制订之后，还要有切实具体的措施，来保证计划的实现。　　在全国广大地区大规模地扫除文盲，主要是在第二个五年计划期间内进行。做好今冬明春农民业余文化教育工作，就可以为执行第二个五年计划作出一个良好的开端。今冬明春在农村中要普遍开展以兴修农田水利、积肥为中心的大生产运动和大规模的社会主义教育。农村的中心任务是相当繁重的。但是，不论合作社的领导，农民群众的社会主义觉悟，学习文化的积极性，都比过去有了很大的提高；同时，由于大批机关干部下放，业余教师的来源愈来愈加扩大；开展这一工作的经验也更加丰富了。这些对于大规模开展今冬明春的业余文化教育都是有利的。因此只要我们能够充分地利用这些有利条件，紧密地配合中心任务，农民业余文化教育工作就可以顺利地开展起来。
    要做好农民业余文化教育工作，必须同农村生产和其他各项工作有适当的配合。这些工作如果配合得好，不仅使农民业余文化教育工作得以正常进行，而且还可以通过农民文化学习组织，推动生产和其他工作的顺利完成。可是有些地方在实际工作中，常常由于没有对各项工作作出全面的规划和适当的安排，结果就把业余文化教育工作挤掉了。这是不好的。当然，过分地不适当地强调文化学习，以致妨碍生产或其他中心任务，那也是不对的。但是，由于农民的文化学习是一项经常性的工作，不像生产和中心工作那样紧迫，因而往往会使人们发生一种错觉，以为这件事情可做可不做，可以早做，也可以晚做。因此往往容易忽视它，把它挤掉。应该指出，要建设现代化的农业，必须尽可能快地提高农民的文化水平，农民长期处于文盲状态是不行的。忽视农民业余文化教育，对发展生产是不利的。
    农民业余文化教育要同生产运动和社会主义教育紧密配合，因此，对于农民的生产和学习（包括政治学习和文化学习）及社会政治活动，各级党委和政府，首先要作通盘筹划，统一安排。就是说，要对农民的业余时间作统筹安排。这是保证农民学好文化的关键问题。这里特别提一下乡、合作社、生产队的业余时间的统筹安排问题。在今冬、明春，农业生产的门类复杂，变化较大，社会主义教育和整社工作也在进行。乡、合作社、生产队的领导上应该按照这种情况，及时地灵活地安排农民文化学习的时间。例如在大鸣大放或某些人生产特别紧张的时候，就可以减少文化学习时间，甚至暂时停止文化学习。这一阶段过去之后，就应该迅速恢复正常的文化学习。其次，要充分地利用农民的学习组织进行社会主义教育，要加强民校的政治课，政治课的内容应该是社会主义教育。文化课的教学内容也可以适当地结合政治教育进行。学习组织应该同生产情况相适应，并且随着生产情况的变化而变化，当前应该注意采取分散和集中相结合的办法进行教学。
    农民业余文化教育工作必须贯彻群众路线。按照农业发展纲要的要求，全国今后每年将要扫除一、两千万的文盲，这就需要每年组织一定数量的人入学和坚持学习。现在有些地方文盲中学习条件好的人日益减少，条件差的人相对增加，再加今冬明春农村中心任务又比较重，这就要求我们必须深入地发动群众，紧紧地依靠群众，尽力设法争取更多的农民参加业余文化学习。发动群众参加业余文化学习，除了农村的党、政、合作社要负责进行以外，共青团、妇联、扫盲协会等组织也应很好地担当起这个任务。在做法上，仅仅限于一般的宣传动员是不够的，必须进行细致的组织工作，有计划地团结一批学习、教学、办学等几方面的积极分子，通过他们向群众广泛、深入地进行宣传教育，发动群众入学并坚持学习。对于有关学习中的一些事情，要和群众商量，并由他们自己去做。领导的责任只在于随时了解群众学习中的思想情绪和困难，进行启发教育，鼓励支持，及时帮助他们解决学习中的困难。
    冬季已经到来，希望各地很好地利用今冬明春的时间，切实地把农民业余文化教育工作迅速地开展起来。
