    Hooking Up	Lù Xī
    Recently, various middle schools have been intensifying labor education, and the vast majority of students are actively participating in physical labor. In many schools, a new atmosphere has begun to emerge, establishing a new school ethos. However, how can labor education be made a regular practice? How can participation in physical labor be made a regular practice, and not just a temporary surge? The middle schools in Hangzhou have provided us with a relatively good method.
    The method of Hangzhou middle schools is that the schools establish regular and fixed contact systems with agricultural cooperatives in the suburbs, assign students to production teams, directly linking them with the production teams, and regularly participate in physical labor for a certain period of time. The method of schools establishing fixed contact with agricultural cooperatives can not only regularize students' participation in labor, but also make it easier for students to make friends with farmers, establish close feelings, and cultivate their love for the countryside and labor. On the side of the agricultural cooperatives, they can also have a clear understanding and arrange work for students in a planned way, enriching students' production knowledge. In this way, the phenomenon of students participating in physical labor in a temporary surge can be avoided.
    Hangzhou's method is worth learning. Schools can not only hook up with agricultural cooperatives, but also with other production units, establishing regular rather than temporary contact systems to ensure that students can regularly participate in physical labor and regularly receive labor education.

    挂钩	路兮
    最近以来，各地中学深入加强了劳动教育，广大学生积极参加体力劳动。在许多学校里，开始呈现了一片新气象，树立起新校风。可是，怎样使劳动教育经常化？怎样使参加体力劳动经常化？而不只是突击一阵呢？杭州市中学为我们提供了一个比较好的办法。
    杭州市中学的办法是，学校方面同郊区农业合作社建立经常的固定的联系制度，把学生编到生产队里，同生产队直接挂上了钩，定期去参加一定时间的体力劳动。学校同农业社建立固定联系的办法，不但可以使学生参加劳动经常化，而且，学生也便于同农民交上朋友，建立亲密的感情，培养自己热爱农村、热爱劳动的思想。在农业社方面，也可以做到心中有数，有计划地为学生安排活计，丰富学生生产知识。这样，就可以避免学生参加体力劳动的一阵风现象。
    杭州的办法是值得学习的。学校不但可以同农业社挂上钩，而且同其它生产单位也可以挂上钩，建立经常的而不是一时的联系制度，来保证学生能经常地参加体力劳动，经常地受到劳动教育。
