Xinhua News Agency, November 4th dispatch from New York according to TASS: The head of the Soviet delegation to the 12th session of the United Nations General Assembly, Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko, flew from New York to Moscow on November 3rd.

At the New York airport, Gromyko made a statement to newspaper and radio reporters, saying that the discussion of the issue raised by the Syrian government at the United Nations General Assembly had achieved certain positive results. Although the General Assembly did not adopt any formal resolution, the discussion of the issue itself showed that the majority of the members of the United Nations were taking the issue seriously and expressing great concern about the current situation, because they understood the dangerous consequences that would result if Syria were invaded. The United Nations should remain vigilant, because it is not yet possible to believe that those plotting to invade Syria will abandon their adventurous plans.

Gromyko went on to say that during the discussion of the disarmament issue at the General Assembly, as in the past, two approaches were demonstrated. The Soviet Union and many other countries firmly maintained that it was necessary to implement the reduction of armed forces of all countries and the unconditional prohibition of nuclear weapons. However, the Western countries, on the contrary, are still deliberately creating obstacles on the disarmament issue. He said that the Soviet Union resolutely condemned the policies of the Western countries, because they are obstructing the achievement of disarmament agreements, and therefore must bear full responsibility to the people of all countries.

Gromyko said that there are many important issues on the agenda of the General Assembly, the first of which is the Soviet government's proposal on peaceful coexistence among countries. We hope that during the discussion of this issue, the United Nations General Assembly will give it serious consideration, and not be dictated by those who oppose the easing of international tension, and prefer to push their own country and their allies in aggressive military blocs onto the dangerous road that has serious consequences for the cause of universal peace.

Gromyko concluded by expressing his best wishes to the American people.

    葛罗米柯返苏前在纽约发表谈话
    联合国仍应警惕侵叙阴谋
    并指责西方还在阻挠达成裁军协议
    新华社4日讯　据塔斯社纽约4日讯：苏联出席联合国大会第十二届会议的代表团团长、苏联外交部长葛罗米柯11月3日从纽约乘飞机前往莫斯科。
    葛罗米柯在纽约机场上向报纸和电台记者发表谈话说，联合国大会对叙利亚政府提出的问题的讨论，获得了一定的积极成果。虽然大会并没有通过任何形式的决定，但是，讨论这个问题本身就说明了联合国的多数会员国是认真地对待这个问题的，并且对目前的局势表示了极大的耽心，因为他们懂得，如果叙利亚遭到侵略，将会导致什么样的危险结果。联合国还应当保持警惕，因为现在还不能相信那些策划侵略叙利亚的人会放弃他们的冒险计划。
    葛罗米柯又说，在大会上讨论裁军问题的时候，像过去一样，表现出两种方针。苏联和其他许多国家坚决主张有必要实行裁减各国武装部队和无条件禁止核武器。但是西方国家恰恰相反，它们直到现在还在裁军问题上故意制造障碍。他说，苏联坚决谴责西方国家的政策，因为它们在阻碍达成裁军协议，所以要向各国人民负担全部责任。
    葛罗米柯说，在大会的议程上还有许多重要的问题，其中首先是苏联政府提出的关于各国和平共处的建议。我们希望：在讨论这个问题的时候，联合国大会要对这个问题加以认真的考虑，而不要听命于那些反对缓和国际紧张局势、宁愿把自己的国家以及自己的侵略军事集团的同盟国推向对普遍和平事业具有严重后果的危险道路的人。
    葛罗米柯最后向美国人民表示最好的祝愿。
