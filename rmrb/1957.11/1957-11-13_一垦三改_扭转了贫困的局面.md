"One Reclamation, Three Reforms" Reverses the Poverty Situation
Wang Luming, First Secretary of the CCP Cang County Committee, Hebei Province

From Grain-Deficient Area to Grain-Surplus Area

This year, Cang County Prefecture has seen an unprecedented record in grain production: the total grain output of the entire area is expected to reach 2.5 billion jin, an increase of 39% compared to the average annual output of the past eight years, and an increase of 14% compared to 1955 (the year with the highest output). If it hadn't been for the drought, this year's harvest would have been even better.

Historically, Cang County Prefecture has been a poor area, with alkaline and barren land, frequent droughts and floods, many low-yield crops, insufficient fertilizer, and extensive cultivation. Of the more than 21 million mu of land in the 18 counties (cities) of the prefecture, there are more than 3 million mu of wasteland, and about 1 million mu of perennially waterlogged ports and depressions. Cultivated land is only over 17 million mu. Among the cultivated land, there are 5 million mu of saline-alkali land and more than 4 million mu of low-lying, flood-prone land (totaling 53% of the total cultivated land). There are many dry fields and few paddy fields. In spring, there are often wind, sand, and rain, and the land's salinity rises, making sowing and seedling protection difficult. In late summer and early autumn, rainfall is concentrated, making it easy to suffer from waterlogging and floods. From 1949 to the present, in nine years, there have been four years of relatively serious flooding and two years of poor harvests due to drought. This situation has caused a large reduction in production and also caused the increasing alkalization of cultivated land, increasing the amount of wasteland, and resulting in annual grain shortages, adding a great burden to the state. Since the implementation of the state monopoly for the purchase and sale of grain in 1953, the state has transferred in more than 1 billion jin of grain over the past four years. The vast majority of farmers have many difficulties in production and life. Therefore, vigorously constructing water conservancy projects to change the drought and flood situation of farmland and the saline-alkali condition of the land has become an important task for Cang County Prefecture to develop agricultural production and fundamentally change the face of poverty.

For more than two years, under the correct leadership of the Central Government and the Hebei Provincial Party Committee, and in view of the characteristics of our region, we have relied on agricultural cooperatives, fully mobilized the masses, and, adhering to the principles of active leadership, steady progress, and utilization and transformation of nature, vigorously launched the "One Reclamation, Three Reforms" movement. ("One Reclamation" is: reclaiming wasteland; "Three Reforms" are: transforming saline-alkali land, transforming low-lying land, and reforming crop planting). In two years, a total of 840,000 mu of wasteland have been reclaimed, 1.8 million mu of saline-alkali land have been transformed, 1.3 million mu of low-lying land have been transformed, and crop planting has been reformed on more than 5 million mu. These projects have cumulatively increased grain production by more than 600 million jin, cotton production by 800,000 jin, and other income by more than 3 million yuan. The poor and backward situation in the Cang County area has begun to change: in the past, there was a shortage of more than 200 million jin of grain every year, but this year there may be a surplus of about 100 million jin, relieving the state's grain supply burden and also enabling many farmers to embark on a new and prosperous life (25.37% of the agricultural cooperatives in the district have reached the production level of well-to-do middle peasants). The members of the cooperatives in the reclaimed and reformed areas sing: "Socialism is good, collectivization is strong, the Communist Party's leadership has strength, large tracts of wilderness are built into villages, and saline-alkali wastelands are turned into granaries."

In the past, the masses in Shanggulin Village, Huanghua County, on the coast of the Bohai Sea, lived by gathering firewood, fishing, and hunting geese, and their lives were extremely poor. Last year, this village reclaimed wasteland and planted 3,100 mu of rice, with an average yield of 645 jin per mu, and an average income of 1,400 jin per person. This year, 3,200 mu were planted, and the average yield is expected to be 850 jin per mu, and the average income is 1,900 jin per person. The members of this cooperative excitedly said: Last year it was "plow one and surplus two," and this year it is "plow one and surplus three." More than 500 houses have been built in the whole village, and a lot of agricultural and sideline production tools and daily furniture have been purchased. More than 30 poor bachelors have married wives, and they happily said: "In the past, girls got married and went far away, but now girls from far away come to Beidagang." The Shajingzi Village Agricultural Cooperative reclaimed more than 9,000 mu of wasteland and planted rice this year, with an expected average yield of 1,000 jin per mu and an average income of more than 10,000 jin per household. The members happily said: "Reclaiming wasteland and changing planting is 'a step to heaven.' In the past, a year's income would be used up in half a year, and *huangcaipanzi* (a kind of wild vegetable growing in saline-alkali land) filled the stomach. Now, a year's income can be eaten for five years, and every household has surplus grain." All the members of the cooperative wrote a congratulatory letter to Chairman Mao and sent a small package of *huangshuicai* and a small package of rice with the letter, reporting the changes in their past and present lives. After receiving Chairman Mao's reply, the members were greatly encouraged. Yuan Ziyun, an 82-year-old poor peasant member, said: "Chairman Mao's letter should be properly preserved so that future generations will know how bitter our village was in the past, how sweet the present is, and never forget the kindness of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party." All the land in Xuguantun Village in Cang County is saline-alkali land. In the past, the farmers worked hard for a year to have enough to eat in the autumn. After cooperation, all the saline-alkali land was transformed in three years, and the whole village became a grain-surplus cooperative, selling 40,000 jin of surplus grain to the state last year. Because of the increased production, the lives of the members of many agricultural cooperatives have gradually improved, their patriotism and love for the cooperative have been strengthened, their labor has become more active, and the cooperative itself has been further consolidated.

Coastal Wastelands Become Granaries

The prefecture has about 3 million mu of wasteland, most of which is distributed in Cang County, Huanghua, Yanshan, Nanpi, and Mengcun counties in coastal areas. The areas are large and concentrated and relatively fertile. After reclamation and transformation, they can be turned into good land. In 1955, we began to measure the wasteland, test the soil, and test the reclamation, and formulated a reclamation plan. Large tracts of wasteland are reclaimed by tractors, and small tracts of wasteland are reclaimed by agricultural cooperatives using human and animal power. The reclaimed large tracts of wasteland are cultivated in two ways: one is to establish three state-owned and reform-through-labor farms (cultivating about 200,000 mu). This method requires large state investment and high costs, but the work is easier. The second is to mobilize agricultural cooperatives to immigrate and set up branch cooperatives. In the spring of 1956, more than 16,000 young men and women volunteers were mobilized and organized in various agricultural cooperatives to build and expand 26 villages and establish 29 reclamation agricultural cooperatives in Cang County, Huanghua, Nanpi, and Mengcun counties. Livestock, farm implements, financial resources, materials, etc. were mainly prepared by the agricultural cooperatives where the reclamation team members came from. The state provided subsidies for the insufficient parts. The reclamation cooperative and the old cooperative uniformly distributed the income. This method requires less state investment, lower costs, and faster returns, but there are more difficulties and arduous work at the beginning. However, practice has proved that as long as we rely on cooperatives, mobilize the masses, and follow the mass line, difficulties can be overcome. Over the past two years, the reclamation cooperatives have been consolidated. Most of the unmarried young men and women reclamation team members have gotten married, and many team members have moved their families here, laying the foundation for large-scale immigration and reclamation in the future. The members of the Beidagang Mutual Aid Agricultural Cooperative in Huanghua County said that reclamation is "bitter in the first year, sweet in the second year, and a great improvement in life in the third year."

Let Saline-Alkali Land and Low-Lying Land Turn Over

There are about 5 million mu of saline-alkali land in the prefecture, and each mu only produces dozens of jin of grain. From 1955, we began to conduct investigations and research, summarize the experience of the masses, and organize agricultural cooperatives to conduct experiments on transforming saline-alkali land. In 1956, we comprehensively carried out the work of transforming saline-alkali land. Up to this year, a total of 1.8 million mu of saline-alkali land have been transformed in the prefecture, of which 800,000 mu have been transformed better. A total of more than 60 million jin of grain have been produced cumulatively in two years. The methods of transformation are: using river water, water storage, rainwater, well water, and pit water for alkali washing, silt deposition, alkali suppression, and replanting. More than 250,000 mu of rice have been replanted in saline-alkali land throughout the prefecture, with an average yield of 450 jin per mu, which is the most thorough method of transforming saline-alkali land. After 551 mu of severely saline-alkali land in the Liubiaozhuangzi Agricultural Cooperative in Cang County were replanted with rice, the average yield was 600 jin per mu, an increase of more than tenfold compared to the past. The prefecture used the opportunity of abundant water and high sand content during the flood season to deposit silt on more than 100,000 mu, which can guarantee two or three years of harvest. In the past two years, the prefecture has built 300,000 mu of ditch and embankment fields and 7,000 mu of terraced fields. The Renhe Village Agricultural Cooperative in Cang County had 12,000 mu of saline-alkali land with no income over the years. After washing the saline-alkali land with river water last spring, the average yield was 120 jin of grain or 80 jin of seed cotton per mu. The Xueguantun Agricultural Cooperative's wheat yield after washing with river water averaged 111 jin per mu. Xuguantun used well water and pit water to wash and suppress alkali, and the grain yield per mu increased from 70 to 80 jin before the transformation to 240 jin. The Liushe Township of Mengcun County built 3,200 mu of saline-alkali land with ditches and embankments to suppress alkali with rainwater, and the average yield per mu increased by 29 jin compared to the past. Processing and fertilizing and improving cultivation methods also have a good effect on transforming saline-alkali land. Leveling the land, building ridges and dams, maintaining water and soil, fine cultivation and rough harrowing, and increasing the application of organic fertilizer can neutralize alkalinity. Another method is to replant alkali-resistant crops. The Zhao Guanzhuang of Cang County, the Hu Zhuangzi of Huanghua, and other agricultural cooperatives used ridge-building to store water and plant grass to raise green manure, and increased production greatly in the second year. Excavating soil and replacing soil are the most widely used methods by the masses. This method is only effective in the current year and cannot fundamentally transform saline-alkali land.

There are about 4 million mu of low-lying and flood-prone land in the prefecture. According to the principle of adapting to, utilizing, and transforming nature, 2.8 million mu of earthen embankment ridge fields and 180,000 mu of ditch ridge fields have been built in the past two years, and more than 100 drainage ditches have been excavated and renovated. A large number of flood-resistant and harvest-guaranteed crops have been planted. In these areas, even in the severe floods last year, grain production increased by more than 80 million jin.

Implement Planting Reform

One of the main reasons for the low grain yield in Cang County Prefecture is that there are many low-yield crops and few high-yield crops, and the land utilization rate is low. After cooperation, according to the national plan and the needs of the farmers, planting reform was implemented in accordance with local conditions, and various crops were rationally allocated, resulting in a large increase in production.

Before cooperation, the prefecture generally planted corn on about 4.5 million mu every year, and most of it was summer corn and low-yielding varieties. Last year, thanks to vigorous well digging and fertilizer accumulation, 6.6 million mu of spring corn and summer corn were planted. Most of them were planted with high-yielding varieties such as *maya* and Golden Queen. Except for 3 million mu that suffered from floods, the remaining 3.6 million mu increased production by more than 30 jin per mu compared to the past. A total of more than 100 million jin of grain was produced. This year, because there are more wheat fields and less spring fallow land, and the weather is dry, the corn planting area has been reduced (a total of 4.83 million mu have been planted). More than 2 million mu were converted to high-yielding varieties, with an average increase of 25 jin per mu, totaling 50 million jin. A total of 150 million jin have been produced cumulatively in two years. Last year, the area under sweet potatoes in the prefecture increased from 400,000 mu to 800,000 mu, and this year it increased to 830,000 mu. More than 90% of the high-yielding variety Victory No. 100 was planted, an increase of 200 jin of grain per mu compared to before the replanting. A total of 140 million jin of grain have been produced cumulatively in two years. Some measures have also been taken to expand the area of multiple cropping, that is, one crop is changed to two crops, and two crops with conditions are changed to three crops. Intercropping and intercropping have been implemented. Cumulatively in two years, the average yield per mu has increased by more than 20 jin, totaling more than 40 million jin of grain. The above-mentioned replanting has cumulatively increased grain production by more than 330 million jin in two years.

Build Water Conservancy to Eliminate Water Damage

One of the keys to doing a good job in "One Reclamation, Three Reforms" is to build water conservancy projects and prevent water damage. In the era of small-scale peasant economy, not only a large amount of river water and drainage water flowed into the sea in vain after disasters during the flood season and rainy season, but also river water and groundwater were not fully utilized at ordinary times. Since the implementation of "One Reclamation, Three Reforms" after cooperation, the river water and groundwater sources that can be excavated in the entire district are fully utilized at ordinary times; a large amount of water is stored during the flood season and rainy season for irrigation in the coming spring. In this way, not only water conservancy was actively built, but also water damage was prevented. In the past two years, the prefecture has completed more than 20 million cubic meters of water conservancy projects, built 8 pumping stations, 150 culverts, and more than 1,800 other large and small buildings, and dug more than 220,000 brick wells. Last year, more than 1,000 ports, parks, depressions, abandoned rivers, and large pits were renovated and utilized, storing more than 500 million cubic meters of water, and the area of paddy fields and irrigated land in the entire prefecture was expanded by more than 1.6 million mu, which not only guaranteed a large increase in agricultural production, but also developed aquatic crops, planted more than 100,000 mu of reeds, cattails, and lotus roots, and developed fish farming.

Three Experiences

Practice over the past two years has proved that "One Reclamation, Three Reforms" is a major reform in agricultural production in the Cang County area and an effective measure for a large increase in production. In leading this production increase movement over the past two years, the three most profound experiences we have gained are as follows:

First, strengthening the Party's leadership, constantly fighting against backward and conservative ideas, and preventing impetuous emotions are the primary guarantee for the healthy development of the "One Reclamation, Three Reforms" movement. After cooperation, we analyzed the natural characteristics of Cang County Prefecture and the new situation after cooperation, and determined that "One Reclamation, Three Reforms" is the central link in the Party's leadership of the large-scale production movement. Leading cadres at all levels of the Party and government took personal command and organized the Reclamation and Reform Headquarters to specifically lead this work. The biggest difficulty encountered in this work at first was the resistance of backward and conservative ideas. Many comrades did not have enough understanding of the characteristics of the region and underestimated the new conditions after cooperation. This kind of thinking was most serious among some engineering and technical personnel in the agriculture and water conservancy departments. In the leadership of some areas, there was fear of difficulties and hesitation in production reform. After Chairman Mao put forward the call to "do everything possible to overcome difficulties and strive for a bumper agricultural harvest" this spring, our prefecture convened a cadre meeting of more than 1,500 people, summarized the reclamation and reform experience of last year, organized exhibitions and visits, and unified the thinking of the whole Party, thereby pushing the reclamation and reform movement to a new climax.

Second, strengthening investigation and research, summarizing the experience of the masses, and making good typical demonstrations, the method of "One Reclamation, Three Reforms" was created by the broad masses of peasants in the period of primary cooperatives. The success of the agricultural cooperatives in Shanggulin and Shajingzi villages in reclaiming more than 100 mu of wasteland and planting rice in 1954, the transformation of saline-alkali land by the Hu Zhuangzi and Zhao Guanzhuang agricultural cooperatives, the transformation of the low-lying land in the Dalangdian by the Nianlaowa Agricultural Cooperative of Nanpi and the Xiaoguantun Agricultural Cooperative of Cang County, and the planting reform by the Nanhetou Agricultural Cooperative of Xianxian, the Junziguan Agricultural Cooperative of Hejian, and the Xuguantun Agricultural Cooperative of Cang County all achieved a large increase in production. We summarized their experience and made key demonstrations in the whole district in 1955, thereby strengthening the leadership's determination and confidence and boosting the enthusiasm of the broad masses. It was comprehensively promoted in 1956, forming a mass "reclamation and reform" movement.

Third, relying on cooperatives, fully mobilizing the masses, and following the mass line will surely overcome difficulties. The reclamation and reform movement requires a large amount of manpower, funds, materials, and technical forces. It is not enough to rely on the state alone. Only by relying on cooperatives, each cooperative contributing labor, everyone pooling funds and materials, and finding local experts when technical personnel are insufficient, and adhering to the principles of spending less money, doing more things, being simple and easy to implement, having quick returns, and combining with the current interests of the masses, can we overcome difficulties. More than 80% of the "reclamation and reform" costs in the entire prefecture in the past two years were raised by the agricultural cooperatives themselves.

There are also many shortcomings and problems in the "reclamation and reform" movement. We are determined and confident to overcome and solve them in the future.

After the discussion of the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft), our confidence in doing a good job in the "reclamation and reform" movement has been further enhanced. The preliminary plan is to complete the reclamation of more than 2 million mu of wasteland, thoroughly transform 2 million mu of saline-alkali land, transform 2.5 million mu of low-lying land, build more than 10 million mu of field projects, expand the irrigated area to 5 million mu, actively carry out planting reform, rationally allocate various crops, develop high-yield crops, and expand the multiple cropping index during the second five-year plan period. By 1962, the total grain output of the prefecture will reach 4 billion jin, and 1 billion jin of grain can be delivered to the state. The cotton fields will be expanded from more than 1.7 million mu this year to 2.5 million mu.

    “一垦三改”扭转了贫困的局面
    中共河北省沧县地委第一书记　王路明
    缺粮区变成余粮区
    今年沧县专区出现了粮食增产的空前纪录：全区的粮食总产量预计将达到二十五亿斤，比近八年的平均年产量增加39％，比丰收的1955年（产量最高的一年）增产14％。若不是受了旱灾的话，今年的收成还要更好。
    沧县专区历史上就是一个贫困的地区，土地碱荒，旱涝多灾，低产作物多，肥料不足，耕作粗放。全区十八个县（市）二千一百多万亩土地中，荒地有三百多万亩，常年积水的港淀洼泊有一百万亩左右，耕地只有一千七百多万亩。在耕地中又有盐碱地五百万亩、低洼易涝地四百多万亩（两项合计占耕地总数53％）。旱田多，水田少。春季多风、沙、雨，土地盐碱上升，播种保苗困难；夏末秋初雨量集中，易于遭受沥涝和洪水灾害，从1949年到现在，九年中就有四年遭到较严重的水涝灾害，有两年因为干旱歉收。这种情况，造成了大量减产，而且引起了耕地的日益碱化，使荒地增多，年年粮食不足，给国家增加很大负担：自1953年实行粮食统购统销至今，四年来国家共调入十亿多斤粮食。广大农民在生产上、生活上都有很多困难。因此，大力兴修水利，改变农田旱涝、土地碱荒的状况，已经成为沧县专区发展农业生产和从根本上改变贫困面貌的重要任务。
    两年多以来，我们在中央、河北省委的正确领导下，针对我区的特点，依靠农业社，充分发动群众，本着积极领导、稳步前进、利用和改造自然的方针，大力开展了“一垦三改”运动。（“一垦”是：开垦荒地；“三改”是：改造盐碱地，改造低洼地，农作物种植改革）。两年共计开垦荒地八十四万亩，改造盐碱地一百八十万亩，改造低洼地一百三十万亩，农作物种植改革五百多万亩。这几项累计增产粮食六亿多斤、皮棉八十万斤，其他收入三百多万元。沧县地区的贫困落后的状况开始改变了：过去每年缺粮二亿多斤，今年却可有一亿斤左右的余粮，解除了国家的粮食供应负担，也使许多农民开始走向富裕的新生活（全区已有25．37％的农业社的生产水平赶上了富裕中农）。垦改地区的社员们唱着：“社会主义好，合作化强，共产党领导有力量，大片荒野建村庄，盐碱荒地变粮仓”。
    渤海边上的黄骅县上古林村的群众，过去以打柴、治渔、打雁为生，生活极为贫困。去年这个村垦荒种水稻三千一百亩，平均亩产六百四十五斤，每人平均收入一千四百斤，今年播种三千二百亩，预计平均每亩产八百五十斤，每人平均收入一千九百斤。这个社社员们兴奋地说：去年是“耕一余二”，今年是“耕一余三”。全村盖房五百多间，购买了不少农副业生产工具和日用家具等。有三十多名穷单身汉娶了媳妇，他们欢喜地说：“过去姑娘们结婚奔远方，现在是远方的姑娘到北大港。”沙井子村农业社，今年开荒种水稻九千多亩，预计平均亩产一千斤，每户平均收入一万多斤，社员们高兴地说：“垦荒改种‘一步登天’，过去是一年收入半年光，黄菜盘子（生长在盐碱地里的一种野菜）充饥肠，现在是一年收入吃五年，家家户户有余粮。”全体社员给毛主席写了一封报喜信，并随信寄去了一小包黄水菜，一小包大米，报告他们过去和现在生活的变化。在接到毛主席的回信以后，社员们受到了极大的鼓舞。八十二岁的老贫农社员元子云说：“把毛主席的信要好好保存起来，叫后代子孙知道咱村过去是多么苦，现在的甜是怎么来的，永远不要忘了毛主席共产党的恩情。”沧县许官屯全村土地均是盐碱地，过去农民们劳动一年闹个秋饱，合作化后三年时间把盐碱地全部改造了过来，全村变成了余粮社，去年卖给国家四万斤余粮。许多农业社由于增了产，社员生活逐步提高，爱国、爱社的思想增强了，劳动更加积极了，社本身也进一步巩固了。
    海边荒地变粮仓
    全区荒地约有三百万亩，多数分布在沿海地区的沧县、黄骅、盐山、南皮、孟村等县，片大集中，比较肥沃，经过开垦改造，就可变为良田。1955年开始测量荒地、化验土壤、试行垦荒，并制定了垦种规划。对于大片荒地采用拖拉机开垦，小片荒地发动农业社用人畜力开垦。开垦出来的大片荒地采用两种方法耕种：一是建立了三个国营与劳改农场（约耕种二十万亩），这种办法国家投资大、成本高，但是工作好作。一是发动农业社移民办分社。1956年春季在各个农业社中发动组织了一万六千多名青年男女志愿垦荒队员，在沧县、黄骅、南皮、孟村等县新建和扩建了二十六个村庄，建立了二十九个垦荒农业社。牲畜、农具、财力、物力等主要由出垦荒队员所在的农业社筹备，不足部分，国家予以补助。垦荒社和老社统一分配收益。这种办法国家投资少，成本小，收益快，但是在初办时困难较多，工作艰巨。不过，实践证明，只要依靠合作社，发动起群众来，走群众路线，困难是可以克服的。两年来，垦荒社已经巩固下来了，大部未婚的青年男女垦荒队员结了婚，不少队员将家属搬来了，给今后大量移民开荒打下了基础。黄骅县北大港互助农业社的社员们说，垦荒是“头年苦，二年甜，三年生活大改善。”
    让盐碱地、低洼地翻身
    全区盐碱地约有五百多万亩，每亩只产粮几十斤。从1955年开始，进行调查研究，总结群众经验，组织农业社进行改造盐碱地的试验。1956年全面开展了改造盐碱地的工作。到今年，全区共改造盐碱地一百八十万亩，其中改造较好的有八十万亩。两年累计共增产粮食六千多万斤。改造的办法是：利用河水、蓄水、雨水、井水、坑水进行洗碱、放淤，压碱、改种。全区在盐碱地中改种水稻二十五万多亩，平均亩产四百五十斤，这是改造盐碱地最彻底的方法。沧县刘表庄子农业社有五百五十一亩重盐碱地改种水稻后，平均每亩产六百斤，较过去增产十倍多。全区利用汛期水多含沙量大的时机，放淤十多万亩，能保两、三年的收成。两年来全区修作沟洫围田三十万亩，台田七千亩。沧县仁和村农业社有历年来没有收入的盐碱地一万二千亩，去年春季利用河水对盐碱地洗碱后，平均每亩产粮食一百二十斤或籽棉八十斤。薛官屯农业社利用河水洗碱后小麦亩产平均一百一十一斤。许官屯利用井水、坑水洗碱压碱，粮食亩产由改造前的七、八十斤增到二百四十斤。孟村县刘舍乡三千二百亩盐碱地修作沟洫围田利用雨水压碱，平均每亩产量比过去增加二十九斤。加工加肥，改进耕作方法，对改造盐碱地也有良好作用。平整土地，修筑畦埂，保持水土，细耕粗耙，增施有机质肥料，可以中和碱性。又一个办法是改种耐碱作物。沧县赵官屯、黄骅胡庄子等农业社用筑畦蓄水、种草养青，第二年即大量增产。起土、换土，是群众采用最广泛的方法，这种办法只在当年有效，不能从根本上改造盐碱地。
    全区约有低洼易涝地四百万亩，根据适应、利用、改造自然的方针两年来共修土埂畦田二百八十万亩，沟洫畦田十八万亩，开挖和修整排水沟渠一百多条，大量种植了耐涝保收作物。这类地区在去年严重水灾的情况下，还增产粮食八千多万斤。
    实行种植改革
    沧县专区粮食产量不高的主要原因之一，是低产作物多，高产作物少，土地利用率低。合作化后，根据国家计划和农民需要，因地制宜地实行种植改革，合理地配植各种作物，结果大量增产。
    合作化前全区种玉米一般年头在四百五十万亩左右，而且多数的是夏玉米和低产品种。去年靠了大力打井和积肥，种春玉米和夏玉米六百六十万亩。绝大部分种的是马牙、金皇后等高产品种。除去三百万亩遭受水灾外，其余三百六十万亩，比从前平均每亩增产三十多斤。共增产一亿多斤粮食。今年因为麦田多、春白地少，又加上天气干旱，玉米种植面积减少了些（共种四百八十三万亩）。改为高产品种的二百多万亩，每亩平均增产二十五斤，共增产五千万斤。两年累计共增产一亿五千万斤。去年全区薯类栽培面积由四十万亩扩大到八十万亩，今年又扩大到八十三万亩，90％以上种的是胜利百号高产品种，比改种前，每亩增产折粮二百斤。两年累计共增产粮食一亿四千万斤。扩大复种面积方面也采取了一些措施，就是一作改两作，有条件的两作改三作，实行套种、间作等，两年累计，每亩平均增产二十多斤，共增产粮食四千多万斤。以上各项改种两年累计增产粮食三亿三千多万斤。
    兴水利除水害
    搞好“一垦三改”的关键之一，是兴修水利，防除水害。在小农经济时代，不仅汛期、雨季有大量河水、沥水在成灾后白白流入大海，而且平时河水、地下水也没能充分利用起来。合作化后实行一垦三改以来，在平时将全区的河水和可能挖掘的地下水源加以充分利用；在汛期雨季大量蓄水以备来春灌溉。这样作，不仅积极的兴办了水利，也防除了水害。两年来全区完成了水利工程量二千多万公方，建立了扬水站八座、涵闸一百五十个、其他大小建筑物一千八百多个，打砖井二十二万多眼；去年改造、利用一千多个港、泊、淀、洼、废河、大坑，蓄水五亿多公方，全区扩大水田和水浇地一百六十多万亩，不仅保证了农业大量增产，还发展了水产作物，栽植苇、蒲、藕十余万亩，发展了养鱼事业。
    三点体会
    两年来的实践证明，“一垦三改”是沧县地区农业生产上的重大改革，是大量增产的有效措施。两年来在领导这个增产运动中，我们体会最深刻的是下面三个经验：
    第一，加强党的领导，经常和落后保守思想作斗争，防止急躁情绪，是一垦三改运动健康发展的首要保证。合作化以后，我们分析了沧县专区自然特点和合作化后的新情况，确定了“一垦三改”是全党领导大生产运动的中心环节。各级党政负责干部亲自挂帅，组织了垦改指挥部，专门领导这项工作。这项工作首先遇到的最大困难，就是落后保守思想的抵抗。不少同志对本地区的特点了解不够，对合作化后的新条件估计不足，这种思想以农业、水利部门的某些工程技术人员为最严重。在某些地区的领导上，畏惧困难，对生产改革迟疑不前。今春毛主席提出了“千方百计，克服困难，争取农业大丰收”的号召后，我们专区召开了一千五百多人的干部大会，总结了去年垦改经验，组织了展览参观，把全党思想统一了起来，从而使垦改运动推向新的高潮。
    第二，加强调查研究，总结群众经验，作好典型示范，“一垦三改”的办法在初级社时期就被广大农民创造出来了。1954年上古林、沙井子两个村的农业社，开垦一百多亩荒地种植水稻的成功，胡庄子、赵官屯等农业社对盐碱地的改造，南皮年涝洼、沧县肖官屯等农业社对大浪淀的洼地改造，献县南河头、河间君子馆、沧县许官屯等农业社种植改革，都获得了大量增产。我们总结了他们的经验，于1955年在全区作了重点示范，从而增强了领导上的决心和信心，鼓舞了广大群众的积极性。1956年全面推广，形成了群众性的“垦改”运动。
    第三，依靠合作社，充分发动群众，走群众路线，就一定能克服困难。垦改运动，需要大量的人力、资金、物料、技术力量，光靠国家是不行的，只有依靠合作社，劳力各社出，资金、物料大家凑，技术人员不足找土专家，本着少花钱、多办事、简便易行、收益快、和群众的当前利益相结合的原则办事，就把困难克服了。全区两年来“垦改”的费用，80％以上是农业社自行筹措的。
    在“垦改”运动中，也有不少缺点和问题，我们有决心有信心在今后加以克服和解决。
    经过对全国农业发展纲要（修正草案稿）的讨论，我们搞好“垦改”运动的信心更增强了。初步计划，在第二个五年计划期内，把二百多万亩荒地全部开垦完，彻底改造盐碱地二百万亩，改造低洼地二百五十万亩，修筑田间工程一千多万亩，灌溉面积扩大到五百万亩，积极进行种植改革，合理配植各种作物，发展高产作物，扩大复种指数。1962年全区粮食总产量将达到四十亿斤，可交给国家十亿斤粮食。棉田将由今年的一百七十多万亩扩大到二百五十万亩。
