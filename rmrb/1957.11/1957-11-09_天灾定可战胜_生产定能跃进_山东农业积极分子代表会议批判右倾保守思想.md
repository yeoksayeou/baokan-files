    Natural Disasters Can Certainly Be Overcome, Production Can Certainly Leap Forward
    Shandong Agricultural Activists' Representatives Conference Criticizes Right-leaning Conservative Thought

    (Reported by this newspaper) A province-wide mass debate on agricultural production is about to unfold in Shandong. The debate will focus on the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft), in connection with the province's 1958 plan and the Second Five-Year Plan. Currently, the first step is to conduct a mass debate to resolve the right-leaning conservative thinking within and outside the Party on agricultural production issues.
    How can we thoroughly overcome the right-leaning conservative thinking that has become a serious obstacle in the production upsurge? On what key issues should we launch a mass debate to thoroughly clarify major rights and wrongs? The Shandong Province's Third Agricultural Socialist Construction Activists' Representatives Conference, which opened on the 3rd, is discussing the following questions: (1) Relying on the Heavens? Or transforming nature? (2) Crawling? Or leaping forward? (3) Has production reached its peak? Or is production endless? (4) Are disasters and difficulties an obstacle to progress? Or the driving force for progress? (5) Does agriculture have a future?
    More than a thousand activist representatives attending the meeting can refute the erroneous views of right-leaning conservatism with their own personal experiences. Many of them first overcame right-leaning conservatism before achieving victory. For example, in two years, the province expanded the irrigated area by more than 17 million mu, which is equal to more than double the irrigated land in the province's water conservancy construction over the past several thousand years. For example, the heroic deeds of the Dashan Cooperative in Junan County, which transformed poor mountains and bad waters into a rich and fertile land with the spirit of the Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountain. There are also many typical examples of creating high-yield harvests in sandy and saline-alkali land, which prove that no matter how harsh the natural conditions, there is nothing that cannot be changed in front of communists and the working people. Transforming nature and overcoming difficulties are our natural mission and great character. Can the speed of production increase be accelerated? In 1956, although more than 10 million mu of land in the province were affected by disasters, the growth rate was still 8.6%. Twelve counties in the province have increased by an average of more than 10% per year during the First Five-Year Plan period. Shou Zhang County increased production by 40% after cooperativization compared to 1955, Huang County increased production by 36%, and the Qianjin Cooperative in Dong'e County increased production by 78.12% in 1956 compared to 1954. Isn't this a leap forward without historical precedent? In addition, the increased production facts of the Huang County and Junan County Sunlight Agricultural Cooperatives also refuted the claim that production has reached its peak. In 1955, the average yield per mu in Huang County reached 443 jin, making it the first high-yield county in the province. However, after the first production upsurge after cooperativization, the county achieved another great leap forward of 35% in 1956, reaching a yield of 599 jin per mu, which is more than double the province's yield of 263 jin per mu, exceeding the national twelve-year long-term plan target of 500 jin per mu. The wheat and corn of the Taiyangsheng Agricultural Cooperative in Huang County reached an average yield of 971.4 jin per mu, even under conditions of reduced production due to disasters. The originally very poor Riguang Agricultural Cooperative in Junan County also increased production year by year. Before liberation, the yield per mu here was only 150 jin, but by 1957, it can be increased to 383 jin per mu. They will also strive to increase it to 455 jin in 1958 and reach the target of 550 jin in 1962. The great achievements created by the broad masses of peasants under the leadership of the Party are encouraging people to move forward. Disasters and difficulties must not become an obstacle to our progress. On the contrary, we can completely turn misfortune into blessing and turn bad things into good things. The fact is that this year's floods and droughts in the province have aroused the vigilance of the broad masses of people and their enthusiasm for vigorously building water conservancy projects. Finally, on the issue of whether agriculture has a future, every achievement made on the agricultural production front in Shandong in recent years can powerfully refute the erroneous ideas of conservatives who despise agriculture and think that agriculture is backward and has no future.

    天灾定可战胜　生产定能跃进
    山东农业积极分子代表会议批判右倾保守思想
    本报讯　山东省农业生产上的全民大辩论即将展开。辩论是以全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）为重点，联系本省1958年计划和第二个五年计划而进行。当前首先要经过大辩论，解决党内和党外在农业生产问题上的右倾保守思想。
    怎样彻底克服成为生产高潮中严重障碍的右倾保守思想呢？要在那些关键问题上展开大辩论，彻底弄清大是大非呢？3日开幕的山东省第三届农业社会主义建设积极分子代表会议上正在围绕着以下几个问题进行讨论：（一）靠天吃饭？还是改造自然？（二）是爬行呢？还是跃进？（三）是生产到了顶？还是生产无止境？（四）灾荒和困难是前进的阻力？还是前进的动力？
  （五）农业有没有前途？
    到会的千余名积极分子的代表，都能以自己的亲身体会来驳斥右倾保守主义的错误观点。他们很多人都是首先战胜了右倾保守主义才取得胜利的。如两年内全省扩大水浇面积达一千七百余万亩，等于过去几千年全省水利建设中水浇地的一倍以上。如以愚公移山气魄把穷山恶水变为富饶田园的莒南县大山社的英雄事迹。还有在沙荒、盐碱地上创造高产丰收的奇迹的许许多多典型事例，都证明了不论多么恶劣的自然条件，在共产党人和劳动人民面前，没有改变不了的。改造自然和战胜困难，正是我们的天然使命和伟大性格。增产的速度能不能跃进？1956年全省虽有一千余万亩土地受灾，而增产速度仍为8．6％。全省有十二个县在第一个五年计划期间，平均每年递增10％以上。寿张县合作化后较1955年增产40％，黄县增产36％，东阿县前进社，1956年较1954年增产78．12％。难道这不是没有历史先例的跃进吗？另外，黄县和莒南县日光农业社的增产事实，也驳倒了生产到顶的说法。黄县1955年全县平均亩产已达四百四十三斤，是全省第一个高产县。但经过合作化后第一个生产高潮，到1956年全县就取得了再增产35％的大跃进，达到亩产五百九十九斤，超过全省亩产二百六十三斤的一倍以上，超额实现了全国十二年远景规划亩产五百斤的指标。而黄县太阳升农业社的小麦、玉米，都在因灾减产的情况下，达到全社平均亩产九百七十一点四斤的水平。原来非常贫苦的莒南县日光农业社，也年年增产。解放前这里亩产只有一百五十斤，但到1957年，即可上升到亩产三百八十三斤。他们还要争取1958年提高到四百五十五斤，1962年达到五百五十斤的指标。广大农民群众在党的领导下创造的伟绩，事事都在鼓舞着人们前进，灾荒和困难绝不能成为我们前进的阻力，相反，完全可以转祸为福，把坏事变成好事。事实确是这样：今年全省水灾和干旱更激起了广大群众的警惕和大力兴修水利的积极性。最后在农业有没有前途的问题上，山东农业生产战线上近几年取得的每一个成就，都能有力地反驳保守主义者轻视农业，认为农业落后，没出息的错误思想。
