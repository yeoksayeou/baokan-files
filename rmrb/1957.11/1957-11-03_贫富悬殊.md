    Wealth Inequality
    The October 27th issue of "Fortune" magazine published a list of seventy-six American billionaires. The first on the list is J. Paul Getty of California, whose personal wealth is estimated at between 700 million and 1 billion US dollars. The current US Ambassador to the UK, John Whitney, is also among these seventy-six wealthy individuals, with an estimated wealth of 100 to 200 million US dollars.
    Joseph Kennedy, who served two terms as ambassador, has an estimated wealth of 200 to 400 million US dollars. The current Governor of New York State and former Ambassador, Averell Harriman, has an estimated wealth of 75 million to 100 million US dollars.
    Other individuals listed in "Fortune" magazine's list of wealthy individuals include: Mellon Bruce, Arthur Vining Davis, H.L. Hunt, Paul Mellon, Richard King Mellon, John D. Rockefeller Jr., and Alan M. Scaife. Most of these people belong to the Mellon and Rockefeller families, and their wealth is estimated at 400 to 700 million US dollars.
    However, on the other hand, according to the New York "Daily Worker" newspaper, more than 7 million families in the United States had an annual income of less than $2,000 in 1956, and 3 million of these families had an annual income of less than $1,000 (these income figures do not include taxes). According to the cost of living budget compiled by the Heller Committee in the United States in 1956, the living expenses required for a typical family of four to maintain themselves for a year was $5,400.

    贫富悬殊
    10月27日出版的一期“幸福”杂志发表了七十六名美国亿万富豪的名单。名单上第一个是加利福尼亚的季·保罗·格提，他的私人财产约有七亿到十亿美元。现在美国驻英国大使约翰·惠特尼也在这七十六名富豪之列，他的财产估计为一亿到两亿美元。
    曾经担任过两任大使的约瑟夫·肯尼迪的财产估计为两亿到四亿美元。现任纽约州州长、前大使阿弗里尔·哈里曼的财产估计为七千五百万到一亿美元。
    列入“幸福”杂志富豪名单中的另外一些人有：梅隆·布鲁斯，阿瑟·范宁·戴维斯，赫·耳·享特，保罗·梅隆，理查德·金·梅隆，小约翰·洛克菲勒，阿兰·姆·斯凯夫等。这些人大都属于梅隆家族和洛克菲勒家族，他们的财产估计为四亿到七亿美元。
    但是，另一方面，据纽约“工人日报”报道，美国有七百多万个家庭在1956年的全年收入不及两千美元，其中有三百万个家庭的全年收入不及一千美元（这些收入数字还没有扣除捐税）。而据美国海勒委员会在1956年编制的生活费用预算，一般四口之家维持一年所需的生活费用为五千四百美元。
