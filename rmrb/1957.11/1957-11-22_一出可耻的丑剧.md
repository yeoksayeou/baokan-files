    A Shameful Farce
    Liu Zhongping

    The case of the American soldier Girard who seduced and murdered a Japanese farmer's wife has been judged by the Maebashi District Court of Japan: the murderer Girard was sentenced to three years imprisonment, suspended for four years. The US military authorities immediately stated that Girard would be sent back to the United States within two weeks. This case, which dragged on for more than nine months and caused a great uproar in both Japan and the United States, ended with a verdict that was virtually equivalent to an acquittal, as Japanese newspapers said, this was nothing more than a play staged to deceive the Japanese people.

    People still remember how much lip service was paid between Japan and the United States over the issue of jurisdiction in the Girard case, which even alarmed the top US leader Eisenhower to express his "concern." Of course, the dispute over jurisdiction was not just about Girard alone. In Japan, when people talk about the Girard case, they think not only of the victim, Nakako Sakai, but also of the thousands upon thousands of similar incidents of humiliation and injury, and of the humiliating state of the entire nation, treated like insects. The Japanese people's demand to try Girard according to Japanese law was an expression of their intolerance of the trampling of national dignity and the violation of national sovereignty. In the United States, some bigwigs clamored that handing Girard over to Japanese courts would damage the "morale" and "prestige" of the American troops stationed abroad, arguing that the Soumagahara base, where the shooting occurred, was under "American sovereign jurisdiction" and that Girard's crime could not be a crime of "invading Japan." Obviously, what they were concerned about was not just the personal fate of Girard, a mere pawn; what they wanted to maintain was the privilege of the American army as a colonizer and as a world policeman. Regarding the dispute over jurisdiction, the United States finally made a "concession." This was because Dulles was, after all, smarter than some American congressmen; he saw that the Girard case contained a certain "explosive" element that could "fundamentally affect the relationship between the United States and Japan"; especially the great outbreak of the anti-American movement of the Taiwanese people caused by the Reynolds incident in May, which greatly encouraged the Japanese people and taught Dulles and his ilk a lesson.

    However, when the United States decided to hand Girard over to Japan for trial, it did not admit that jurisdiction should originally belong to Japan, and it was not without reason. At the time, Eisenhower said that "the United States has never relinquished jurisdiction over this case," but only "transferred" jurisdiction for the sake of "being better for all parties concerned." The so-called "better for all parties concerned" meant both to ease the anger of the Japanese people and to give some face to the Kishi Nobusuke government supported by the United States; and to make the trial result favorable to the United States so as not to damage its colonial interests. In order to achieve this goal, Eisenhower said: if there is "any possible unjust treatment," it will be handled "through diplomatic channels." At the same time, Dulles leaked the information that the Japanese judicial authorities would prosecute Girard "under the lightest possible charge of manslaughter under Japanese law." Isn't this blatant interference and a blatant hint? The then acting Prime Minister of Japan, Ishii, also guaranteed: "Americans can rest assured that Girard will receive a fair trial." Singing in harmony, the outcome of the trial was revealed long ago.

    However, the victim's daughter, Kayoko Sakai, held a vain hope: she thought that this trial would let the world know how sacred a person's life is. She didn't know that the play had already been rehearsed, the stage was set in Maebashi, but the lines were issued by Washington, and the executive director was in Tokyo. She didn't know that sacred life, for some people, can also be used for dirty transactions. Although Japan won the formal right to try the crimes of American soldiers (and only crimes committed outside of official duty!), in order to somewhat appease the resentment of the Japanese people, the price it paid was not only the wrongful death of a mother, but also the sweeping away of the dignity of Japanese law. Even the prosecutor of the Maebashi District Public Prosecutor's Office, who, under the instruction of the highest Japanese judicial authorities, had only demanded a five-year prison sentence for Girard, felt that the final verdict was completely unexpected, which shows how much this case was handled to accommodate and please the United States.

    While Kayoko was weeping softly at her mother's grave, while the Japanese people were filled with righteous indignation, Dulles said at a press conference with great satisfaction: "The outcome of the case shows that the trial was very fair, just as we had imagined it would be." This just shows that this "play" was completely staged according to the intentions of the United States. However, can staging such a shameful farce really eliminate the "explosive" elements in US-Japan relations? Dulles and his accomplices in Japan are too naive. As the shameful farce comes to an end, the Japanese people's indignant protests follow, and the struggle is not over. "Blood debts must be repaid with the same thing. The longer the delay, the greater the interest will be paid," those who enjoy killing and those who help murderers escape punishment should remember this truth.

    一出可耻的丑剧
    刘仲平
    美国兵哲腊德诱杀日本农妇案件，已经由日本前桥地方裁判所宣布判决：凶手哲腊德被判处三年徒刑，缓刑四年。美军当局立即表示，要在两星期之内把哲腊德送回美国去。这个拖延九个多月、在日美两国造成了沸沸扬扬的舆论的案件，最后以实际上等于无罪开释的判决收场，正如日本报纸所说，这不过是为了蒙蔽日本人民的眼睛而演出的一出戏。
    人们都还记得：围绕哲腊德案件的审判权问题，日美两国间曾经费过多少唇舌，甚至惊动了美国最高首脑艾森豪威尔出来表示“关心”。当然，关于审判权的争执，不仅仅是关系到哲腊德一个人的问题。在日本，人们谈论哲腊德案件，想到的不仅仅是被害者坂井奈加子，也不仅仅是以千计、以万计同类性质的受侮辱与受损害的事件，而是那种像虫豸一样遭到轻侮和杀害的整个民族的屈辱状态。日本人民要求按照日本法律审判哲腊德，是对于民族尊严受到践踏、国家主权遭到侵犯的不能再加容忍的表现。在美国，某些大人先生们叫嚣把哲腊德交给日本法庭有损美国驻外军队的“士气”和“威信”，认为发生枪杀事件的相马原基地是在“美国主权管辖之下”，哲腊德的犯罪不能成为“侵犯日本”的罪行，显然他们所关心的也不仅仅是哲腊德这个区区小卒的个人命运，他们所要维护的是作为殖民者和作为世界宪兵的美国军队的特权。关于审判权的争执，最后美国作了“让步”。这是因为杜勒斯毕竟比美国某些议员高明些，他看到了哲腊德案件中包含着某种“爆炸性”因素，可能“从根本上影响美国和日本的关系”；特别是5月间由雷诺事件引起的台湾人民反美运动的大爆发，给了日本人民很大鼓舞，也使杜勒斯之流接受了一点教训。
    但是，美国在决定把哲腊德交给日本审判的时候，并没有承认审判权原应属于日本，也不是没有原因的。当时艾森豪威尔曾经说，“美国从来没有放弃过对于这个案件的管辖权”，只是为了“对一切有关方面都更好些”，把管辖权“转让”出去了而已。所谓“对一切有关方面都更好些”，就是说，既要缓和一下日本人民的愤怒情绪，给美国所支持的岸信介政府一点面子；又要使审判结果有利于美国，不致损伤它的殖民利益。为了达到这个目的，艾森豪威尔说：如果“有什么可能的不公正的处理”，将“通过外交途径”来进行处理。同时，杜勒斯则放出空气说，日本司法当局将“按照日本法律所可能得到的最轻的杀人罪名”对哲腊德提出起诉。这难道不是公然的干涉和露骨的暗示么？当时的日本代理首相石井也作了保证：“美国人可以放心，哲腊德将得到公正的审判”。一唱一和，从这里早就透露了审判结果的端倪。
    然而被害者的女儿坂井佳代子却抱着一个虚幻的希望：她以为这次审判会使世界知道一个人的生命如何神圣。她不知道，戏早就排好了，舞台虽然设在前桥，但台词是由华盛顿发出来的，而执行导演是在东京。她不知道，神圣的生命，对于某些人来说，也可以用来进行龌龊的交易。日本虽然争得了对于美国兵的犯罪
  （而且只是非执行公务时间内的犯罪！）进行审判的形式上的权利，借以多少平息一下日本人民的怨愤，但它付出的代价不仅仅是一个母亲的冤沉海底，而且是日本法律的尊严扫地。连根据日本最高司法当局的指使曾经只要求判处哲腊德五年徒刑的前桥地方检察厅的检事，对于最后的判决也感到完全是出于意外，可见这个案件的处理是如何迁就和讨好美国的了。
    当佳代子在她母亲坟前喁喁而泣的时候，当日本人民都感到义愤填膺的时候，杜勒斯在记者招待会上却甚为满意地说：“案子的结局表明审判非常公正，正像我们以前所想像的那样公正”。这恰好说明了这出“戏”完全是按美国的意图演出的。然而果真排演这样一出可耻的丑剧，就能排除日美关系中的“爆炸性”因素么？杜勒斯和他在日本的同伙未免想得太天真了。丑剧收场，日本人民的激愤的抗议接着而起，斗争并没有结束。“血债必须用同物偿还。拖欠得愈久，就要付更大的利息”，那些以杀人作乐和那些帮助凶手逃脱罪责的人们，应该记住这个真理。
