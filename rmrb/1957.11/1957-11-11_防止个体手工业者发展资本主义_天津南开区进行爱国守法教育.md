Xinhua News Agency report: Nankai District in Tianjin recently conducted patriotic and law-abiding education among more than 1,200 individual handicraft households to prevent individual laborers from developing capitalism through exploitation, speculation, profiteering, and shoddy workmanship, using methods such as mass self-imposed patriotic and law-abiding covenants.

In recent years, the number of individual handicraft households in Tianjin has grown rapidly. Of the existing 1,200 or so individual households (with business licenses) in Nankai District, more than 700 were newly established after the collectivization upsurge last year. Due to the large demand for handicraft products in society and the lack of strict management by relevant departments, illegal business practices by individual handicraft households are quite common. According to statistics, among the first batch of 96 individual handicraft workers who participated in patriotic and law-abiding study in Nankai District, 84 had taken various degrees of illegal means to seek exorbitant profits, and had stolen more than 51,600 yuan of state property in the past year or so. There were as many as ten kinds of illegal means, the main ones being illegal hiring of labor for exploitation, shoddy workmanship, reselling raw materials and purchasing unified purchase and sales materials through illegal channels, and tax evasion. After obtaining huge profits through these illegal means, these individual handicraft households also flaunted it to the members of the cooperatives, encouraging them to withdraw.

After the start of patriotic and law-abiding education, groups were formed according to industry and region, and inspections and criticisms were carried out in the form of group meetings. After ideological mobilization, self-examination, mutual accusations and denunciations, and reasoning struggles against key households, a comprehensive review was conducted, and then the stage of drafting patriotic and law-abiding covenants from industry to individual was entered. In this way, both illegal and law-abiding individual handicraft workers received a profound socialist education. Many people listed striving to participate in cooperatives as their future direction of effort in the patriotic and law-abiding covenant. After this education, a new business style also began to be established, and many industries and owners voluntarily made reasonable cost plans, lowered the prices of products, and began to implement a clear price system.

    防止个体手工业者发展资本主义
    天津南开区进行爱国守法教育
    据新华社讯  天津市南开区最近在一千二百多户个体手工业者中进行爱国守法教育，以群众自立爱国守法公约的方法，防止个体劳动者以剥削和投机倒把、偷工减料等手段发展资本主义。
    近年来，天津市的个体手工业户增长很快，南开区现有的一千二百多户（有开业执照的）个体户中，有七百多户是在去年合作化高潮以后新开业的。由于社会上对于手工业产品的大量需要，和有关部门对他们缺乏严格管理，个体手工业户违法经营的情况相当普遍。据统计，南开区第一批参加爱国守法学习的九十六户个体手工业者，有八十四户采取了各种程度的违法手段牟取暴利，一年多以来共盗窃国家资财五万一千六百多元。他们的违法手段共有十种之多，其中主要的有非法雇工剥削、偷工减料、倒卖原料和套购统购统销物资、偷税漏税等。这些违法个体手工业户取得暴利后，还向社员炫耀，鼓动社员退社。
    爱国守法教育开始后，按行业和地区划成小组，用小组会的方式进行检查、批判。经过了思想动员，自我检查，互相检举揭发，对重点户进行说理斗争，全面复查以后，即进入由行业到个人订立爱国守法公约的阶段。这样，不论违法和守法的个体手工业者，都受到了一次深刻的社会主义教育。许多人在爱国守法公约上，把争取参加合作社列为自己今后的努力方向。经过这次教育，新的经营作风也开始树立起来，不少行业和业主都自动做出了合理的成本计划，降低了产品的价格，开始实行明码制度。
