Basically Eliminating Drought and Flood Disasters Within a Year
— The Experience of Xuegou and Shanggou Townships in Building Small-Scale Water Conservancy Projects
Song Haiyan Zheng Shixia
Xuegou and Shanggou Townships in Yu County, Henan Province, relying on the masses' own strength to build small-scale farmland water conservancy projects, basically eliminated soil erosion and drought and flood disasters in the mountainous areas in less than a year.

“Fearing Drought, Fearing Wind, Fearing Water Flow”

Xuegou and Shanggou Townships are both located in shallow mountainous areas. Due to the numerous mountains and large ridges, arable land accounts for less than 20% of the total land area. Most areas are barren mountains and bare ridges with exposed rocks. Whenever it rains, mountain floods rage, carrying mud and sand. Soil erosion occurs on the mountains, and farmland is damaged below. However, just a few days after the rain stops, drought will occur again. Occasionally, a gust of hot wind can scorch the crops in the fields. The masses have a saying: "Three disasters in the mountains mean no harvest, fearing drought, fearing wind, fearing water flow." More than 500 mu of land at the foot of Jishan Mountain in Xuegou Township have been completely rendered unusable due to years of water erosion, resulting in an annual reduction of more than 82,000 jin of grain. In 1942, Shanggou Township suffered a drought. At that time, out of 365 households and 1,650 people in the township, 197 households and 957 people went out to beg for food, and 48 people starved to death. After liberation, under the leadership of the local Party and the People's Government, the masses in the two townships launched a campaign to transform the mountainous areas. However, due to the limitations of the small-scale peasant economy and the failure to adopt fundamental measures to transform the mountains, the results were not significant.

Learning from Daquan Mountain

In the spring of 1956, the vast majority of farmers in the two townships joined advanced cooperatives (one cooperative per township), providing extremely favorable conditions for large-scale small-scale water conservancy construction in the mountainous areas. In order to develop the mountainous areas, the Party branches of the two townships conscientiously studied the higher authorities' policy of "overall planning and comprehensive management" and sent capable cadres to Daquan Mountain in Shanxi to visit and learn. In mid-October of the same year, after the cadres who had visited and learned returned, the two townships launched publicity and education campaigns among the masses on the direction of development of the mountainous areas and specific methods for managing the mountains. The Xuegou Township Party branch also assisted the cooperative management committee in formulating an overall plan for developing the mountainous areas based on local conditions. At the same time, 23 strong laborers with high socialist consciousness and a love for mountainous work were selected from the cooperative to form a basic construction team, led personally by Deputy Director Wang Youliang (a Communist Party member), to focus on taking action on the mountains.

They managed Jishan Mountain, which was of the most vital interest to the township. Before the start of construction, in addition to conducting careful surveys and planning, they also hired three experienced peasant technicians from Daquan Mountain as consultants. The project started from the watershed on the mountain, and gradually developed from the top of the mountain to the foot of the mountain, adhering to the principle of "treating both slopes and gullies." Various comprehensive development measures such as agriculture, forestry, water conservancy, and animal husbandry were implemented according to different terrains and conditions. Horizontal ditches and dikes were dug on gentle slopes with thick soil layers to intercept surface runoff and eliminate slope soil erosion. Fish-scale pits were dug on steep slopes with thin soil layers to disperse and intercept ground runoff. Trees and crops were planted in the pits. Gully head protection projects were carried out at the heads of branch gullies to intercept water and prevent it from flowing into the gullies; check dams were also built in the gullies. Strip cropping was implemented on steeper slopes…. The 23 basic construction team members worked on the mountain for about two weeks and completed more than 40 mu of various soil and water conservation projects. The branch organized the masses to visit the mountain. As a result, the project expanded from the basic construction team to the universal participation of all cooperative members under the principle of "major efforts during slack farming seasons, minor efforts during busy farming seasons, and suspension during peak seasons." At this time, the basic construction team members took on the role of technical guidance in the work.

After the mass soil and water conservation work was launched, in order to facilitate the participation of the surplus labor force among the masses in the project construction anytime and anywhere, the cooperative management committee assisted the basic construction team in making plans on the hillside in advance, delineating the work scope of each team, proposing quality and specification standards for the project, and adopting a piece-rate system to record work points according to the amount of work done. As a result, many cooperative members not only went to the mountains to work during slack farming seasons, but also went to the mountains to work whenever they had a little time, and the project progressed very rapidly. From the end of October 1956 to the end of April this year, the two townships completed horizontal ditches, fish-scale pits, interception ditches, drainage ditches, gully head protection and other high protection forests, check dams, water weirs, reservoirs, sediment settling ponds, ponds, field boundary ridges, rolling water ditches, and other projects in less than seven months, ensuring that 2,300 mu of slopes on Jishan Mountain and Caiping Mountain would no longer experience soil erosion, and at the same time ensuring that more than 1,700 mu of cultivated land at the foot of the mountain would no longer be subjected to water erosion and sand pressure.

Benefits Are Endless

The soil and water conservation projects in Xuegou and Shanggou Townships have yielded significant benefits in the first year. Taking Jishan Mountain in Xuegou Township as an example, there were eight rainfalls in 20 days in July this year, with a total rainfall of more than 410 millimeters. The intensity of the water was rarely seen in a century, but it all disappeared on the mountain without any runoff occurring. One heavy rain reached 122.2 millimeters in less than eight hours, but all projects not only suffered no damage, but the water accumulated in some projects was less than two-fifths of the project capacity. All the projects played the role of "water not flowing down the mountain, and soil not leaving the valley." Due to the elimination of soil erosion on the mountains, not a single mu of the 704 mu of cultivated land at the foot of the mountain was damaged this year, and the autumn crops (grain, cotton, vegetables) on 491 mu of them yielded an increased value of 2,524 yuan compared with the same land at the foot of other mountains that had not been treated. In addition, the increased production of cogon grass on the mountain and the income of 966 yuan from grain and vegetables planted in fish-scale pits and horizontal ditches and other projects totaled 3,490 yuan in increased income. The treatment of Jishan Mountain only cost 6,300 labor days. Calculated at 45 cents per labor day during the autumn distribution of this cooperative, the total cost was 2,835 yuan. Adding the state's 500 yuan investment, the total was only 3,335 yuan. This investment amount is 155 yuan less than the increased income this year. That is to say, the income in one year not only earned back the capital, but also had a surplus.

Due to the construction of soil and water conservation projects, the groundwater level in the mountainous area has risen, which has laid the foundation for the realization of water conservancy on the mountain ridges. In the past, none of the 3,464 mu of cultivated land in Shanggou Township could be irrigated because of the low water level on the mountain ridges. After treating Caiping Mountain this year, although there was a severe drought for more than three months, they used water to fight the drought and plant 1,565 mu of wheat, accounting for 60% of the township's wheat planting plan. Through the drought-resistant wheat planting campaign, the township also newly purchased a waterwheel, dug seven wells, and dug seven springs this year, which was the first time in the local area. The east slope of Caiping Mountain had no springs at all in previous years, but this year a large spring was dug. The cooperative members used a heavy waterwheel to irrigate it continuously for 38 days and nights, and the water in the spring only dropped by four fingers. The two newly dug dry ponds were also filled with water. There is a gully on the south slope of Caiping Mountain. In the past, it was "floods during rain, and dry skin after rain." Now it has become "no (flood) water during rain, and clear water flowing for many days after rain." The local masses have great confidence in realizing water conservancy. Now more than 200 mu of wheat fields have been ditched and are ready for winter irrigation and spring irrigation.

Barren mountains have become green mountains. Before carrying out soil and water conservation on the mountains, because there was insufficient soil moisture on the mountains, not only was the survival rate of afforestation very low, but even grass could not grow. Now this problem has been solved. This year, Xuegou Township combined various soil and water conservation projects and planted a total of 480 mu of peach, apricot, and cypress forests on Jishan Mountain, with a survival rate of over 80% in the absence of rain for three months. In addition, the cogon grass on other mountains was only half a foot deep this year due to the drought, but the cogon grass on Jishan Mountain was one and a half feet deep this year, yielding about 40,000 jin more than in previous years. The masses said: "After carrying out soil and water conservation, trees and grass are also blessed. The benefits of managing the mountains are truly endless."

    一年内基本消灭了旱涝灾害
    ——薛沟、尚沟两乡兴修小型水利经验
    宋海燕  郑师侠
    河南省禹县薛沟、尚沟两乡，依靠群众自己力量兴修小型农田水利，不到一年工夫就基本消灭了山区水土流失和旱、涝灾害。
    “怕旱怕风怕水流”
    薛沟、尚沟两乡都是浅山区。由于山多岭大，耕地面积占不到总土地面积的20％。大部地方都是荒山秃岭，岩石裸露，每逢下雨，山洪滚滚，泥沙俱下，山上水土流失，山下田地被冲坏；但住雨后隔不上几天，就又会发生旱灾，偶尔吹来一阵热风，也能把地里庄稼刮得叶焦秆枯。群众中有“山区灾难三不收，怕旱怕风怕水流”的说法。薛沟乡鸠山下边有五百多亩土地，因为连年被水冲刷，现在已全部不能耕种，每年减产粮食约八万二千多斤。尚沟乡1942年遭旱灾，当时全乡三百六十五户、一千六百五十口人中，就有一百九十七户、九百五十七人出外逃荒，四十八人饿死。解放后，两乡群众在当地党和人民政府领导下，展开了改造山区的工作。但由于小农经济的限制和没有采取根治办法改造山区，因此收效不大。
    向大泉山学习
    1956年春天两乡绝大部分农民加入了高级社（一乡一社），为大兴山区小型水利工作提供了极为有利的条件。两乡党的支部为了开发山区，认真学习了上级“全面规划，综合治理”的方针，并分别派出得力干部到山西大泉山去参观和学习。同年10月中旬，当参观学习的干部回来后，两乡就分别在群众中展开了山区发展方向和治山具体办法的宣传教育工作。薛沟乡党支部并协助社管理委员会根据本地情况作了开发山区的全面规划；同时在社里挑选社会主义觉悟高、热爱山区工作的精壮劳力二十三名，组成基本建设工作队，由副社长王友良（共产党员）亲自率领，有重点的在山上开始行动起来。
    他们治理的是对本乡利害最关紧要的鸠山。开工之前，除作了认真勘查和规划之外，还从大泉山聘请了三位有实际经验的农民技术员作顾问。工程从山上的分水岭开始做起，本着“坡沟兼治”的方针，逐步由山顶到山脚发展。根据不同地形、不同条件实施了农、林、水、牧等全面开发的各项措施。在坡度较缓、土层较厚的地方挖水平沟埂，拦蓄地表径流，消灭坡面土壤冲刷。在坡度陡、土层薄的地方挖鱼鳞坑，分散和拦蓄地面径流；坑内种树也种农作物。在支毛沟头作沟头防护工程，将水拦截不使流入沟内；沟内并修筑谷坊。坡度较大的实行垅作区田……。二十三名基建队员在山上干了约两星期，完成了各种水土保持工程四十多亩。支部组织群众上山参观。于是，工程便在“农闲大干、农忙小干、大忙暂停”的原则下，由基建队而扩大到全体社员普遍动手。这时，基建队员便担当了工作中的技术指导。
    群众性的水土保持工作开展起来以后，为了便于随时随地吸收群众中的剩余劳力参加工程建设，社管理委员会协助基建队事前在山坡上做好规划，划定各队工作范围，提出工程的质量、规格标准，并采取按件计工办法做多少记多少工分。这样一来，很多社员不仅农闲时上山做工，随时有一点时间也到山上去做工，工程进展非常迅速。两乡从1956年10月下旬开工到今年4月底止，以不足七个月的时间，共完成水平沟、鱼鳞坑、截水沟、排水渠、沟头防护等高护岸林、谷坊、水簸箕、蓄水池、澄沙池、水塘、地边埂、滚水渠等工程，可保证鸠山和菜坪山上二千三百亩坡面不再发生水土流失，同时保证山下一千七百多亩耕地不再遭受水冲沙压。
    好处说不完
    薛沟和尚沟两乡的水土保持工程，头一年就收到了显著效益。以薛沟乡的鸠山为例，今年7月份二十天中降雨八次，降雨量共计四百一十多公厘，水势之大，百年少见，但全部消失在山上，没有发生径流。其中一次大雨在不足八个小时内降到一百二十二点二公厘，但所有工程不仅没有一点损坏，有些工程内的积水还不及工程容量的五分之二。全部工程起到了“水不下山，土不出川”的作用。由于消灭了山上水土流失现象，山下七百零四亩耕地今年不仅没有一亩被冲坏，而且其中四百九十一亩秋季作物（粮、棉、菜）较没治理的别的山下同样土地增产价值二千五百二十四元，加上山上白草增产和鱼鳞坑、水平沟等工程内所种粮、菜收入九百六十六元，共计增加收益三千四百九十元。而治理鸠山才费六千三百个劳动日，按这个社秋季分红时每个劳动日值四角五分计算，共为二千八百三十五元，加上国家的五百元投资也不过才三千三百三十五元。这个投资数和今年增加的收益数相比还少一百五十五元。这就是说，一年的收益不仅赚回了本钱，而且还有余利。
    由于兴修了水土保持工程，山区的地下水位提高了，这就为山岗地实现水利化打下了基础。尚沟乡三千四百六十四亩耕地，过去因为山岗地水位低，没有一亩可以用水灌溉。今年治理菜坪山之后，虽然大旱三个多月，他们却用水抗旱种麦一千五百六十五亩，占全乡麦播计划的60％。通过抗旱种麦运动，这个乡今年还新买一部水车，打了七个井，挖了七个泉，这在当地都是开天辟地头一次。菜坪山东坡往年根本没泉，今年却挖出个大水泉，社员们用重型水车在上边连浇三十八昼夜，泉内的水仅下降四指。新挖的二个干塘也盛满了水。山西南坡有条沟，往年是“下雨洪水发，雨过地皮干”，现在变成了“下雨期间不见（洪）水，雨后多日清水流”。当地群众对实现水利化信心很足，现在已有二百多亩麦田打了畦，准备冬浇春灌。
    荒山变成了绿山。没有在山上搞水土保持以前，因为山上墒水不足，不仅造林的成活率很小，就是草也长不起来。现在这个问题解决了。薛沟乡鸠山今年结合各项水土保持工程，共造桃、杏、柏树林四百八十亩，在三个月不雨的情况下成活率达80％以上。此外，别的山上白草今年因旱只长半尺深，鸠山上的白草今年却长一尺半深，比往年约多收四万斤。群众说：“开展水土保持以后，树和草也有福了，治山的好处真是说不完”。
