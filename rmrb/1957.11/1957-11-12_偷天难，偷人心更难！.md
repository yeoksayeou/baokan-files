Stealing Heaven is Hard, Stealing Hearts is Harder!
　　Chí Dì

"Two Chinas" is a despicable and ridiculous trick played by the American imperialists and their lackeys.

In fact, the American imperialists did not intend to create "Two Chinas" from the beginning. They were always fantasizing about a resurrected, stiffened Kuomintang China, wanting only such a China. However, the American imperialists ran into the nail of reality. After the contest on the Korean battlefield, they probably understood that "One China" was not as "realistic" as "Two Chinas." Therefore, they tried every possible means to seek recognition or tacit approval of "Two Chinas" from the great Chinese people. They thought that this would allow them to stabilize their foot on Chinese territory—Taiwan. To achieve this goal, the American imperialists even used so-called "recognition of China" and "allowing China to enter the United Nations" as bait to lure people into acknowledging their aggression. In their view, this seemed to be something the Chinese people were eagerly seeking.

However, the Chinese people do not value American "recognition." The Chinese people have this kind of backbone and will never allow the American imperialists' dirty, hairy leg to contaminate our land. Have you heard? "Even if the United States does not recognize New China for a hundred years, and New China cannot participate in any international conferences or international organizations, we cannot recognize the US occupation of our Taiwan as legal, nor can we allow the situation of 'Two Chinas' to appear in any international conferences or international organizations we participate in."

The American imperialists, who think they are extremely clever, are actually the most ignorant. They failed to force it at the negotiating table in Geneva, and they failed to mix it in at the World Games and the International Geophysical Year Special Committee. Anyone with a little intelligence would know when to retreat. But the American imperialists stubbornly insisted on bringing this clumsy and shameless trick to the International Red Cross Conference, turning an international Red Cross conference into a conference condemning the despicable acts of the American imperialists. They made a great fool of themselves. It really deserves to be called self-inflicted suffering.

However, the American imperialists have not gained nothing. At least, after such a performance, the American imperialists' thick skin has become famous in the world. Just look, after batches of upright people proudly withdrew from the conference, the head of the American delegation could still go on stage and say to some blushing listeners, "The conference does not need to feel ashamed of its actions." This really shows that they do not know the meaning of shame.

The American imperialists may comfort themselves by dragging in the representatives of the two Chiang Kai-shek groups. In fact, this is also not good. Judging from the voting results: those who supported the United States and those who did not support the United States were sixty-two to sixty. In form, there were only two more votes, but in reality, calculated by the population represented, those who withdrew from the conference were more than those who stayed in the conference. Moreover, "among the delegations of some countries and Red Cross societies that do not support us, there are also many people who uphold justice and support our just position!" Moreover, among the countries and Red Cross delegations that support the United States, there are still some "who feel ashamed of their actions," otherwise, why would the head of the American delegation have to go on stage to shout?

Justice resides in the hearts of the people. The head of the Indian government delegation said it well: "No country can recognize 'Two Chinas'." Even if the Americans have the means to steal the heavens, they cannot steal people's hearts. And the further we go, the more openly people's hearts will be revealed. The twenty-nine delegations from the eighteen countries that withdrew from the conference and all those who did not support the American proposal will surely feel proud of their actions!

    偷天难，偷人心更难！

    “两个中国”，是美国佬及其奴才们玩弄的一种卑鄙而又可笑的把戏。
    其实，美国佬一开始也并不打算搞“两个中国”，他们总是幻想着一个僵死了的国民党中国复活起来，想要的只是这样的一个中国。然而美国佬碰了事实的钉子，经过朝鲜战场上的较量，他们大概懂得了“一个中国”不如“两个中国”来得“现实”一些。于是便千方百计的在伟大的中国人民面前求得对“两个中国”的承认或默认。他们以为，这样就可以使他们踏在中国土地——台湾上的一只脚放稳些。为了达到这个目的，美国佬竟以所谓“对中国的承认”“让中国进入联合国”等来作为钓饵，诱骗人们承认它的侵略。在他们看来这好像是中国人民求之不得的。
    然而，中国人民并不稀罕美国的“承认”。中国人民有这种骨气，决不让美国佬那只带毛的脏腿来沾污我们的土地。听见了吧：“即使美国一百年不承认新中国，新中国不能参加任何一个国际会议和国际组织，我们也不能承认美国侵占我国台湾是合法的，我们也不能容许在任何我们参加的国际会议或国际组织中有‘两个中国’的局面出现。”
    自以为聪明绝顶的美国佬，其实是最不识眼相的。在日内瓦的谈判桌上逼不来，在世界运动会上和国际地球物理年专门委员会上混不来，稍具聪明的人总可知难而退了吧。而美国佬偏不，厚着脸皮硬要把这种拙劣而又无耻的把戏搬到国际红十字大会上来耍一耍，这就把一个红十字国际会议变成了一个谴责美国佬卑鄙行径的大会。他为自己出了一场大大的洋相。真称得是自讨苦吃了。
    然而美国佬也不是一无所得的。起码，经过这么一场演出，美国佬的厚脸皮总是在世界上出了名的。试看在一批又一批正直的人昂昂地退出大会以后，美国代表团团长竟还能跑到台上对着一些红着脸的听众们说“会议不必为自己的行动感到羞耻”。这真是不知人间尚有羞耻事了。
    美国佬也许以拉进了两个蒋介石集团的代表来强颜自慰。其实，这也是不妙的。从投票结果看：支持美国的与不支持美国的是六十二比六十，形式上不过只多了两票，实际上，以代表的人口计算，退出大会的比留在大会的还要多。而且，“在一些不支持我们的国家和红十字会代表团中间，也有很多人士是主持正义和支持我们的正义立场的”！而且，在支持美国的国家和红十字会代表团中，也还有一些“对自己的行动感到羞耻的”，不然，美国代表团长何必还要专门跑到台上大嚷呢？
    公道自在人心，印度政府代表团团长说得好：“任何国家都不能承认‘两个中国’”。美国人即使有偷天手段，也不能把人心偷走。而且越往后，人心的向背就越会公开地表露出来。退出大会的十八个国家的二十九个代表团和一切不支持美国提案的人，一定会为自己的行动感到光荣！
