Refuting the Rightists' Slanders Against the People's Congress System
Wu Kejian

During their frantic attack on the Party and socialism, the bourgeois rightists viciously attacked our country's People's Congress system, attempting to shake our country's fundamental system and conspiring to restore the reactionary system of landlords and the bourgeoisie.

The People's Congress system is our country's fundamental political system and the best political organizational form for the vast masses of people to manage their own country. However, the rightists describe it as a formality.

The rightists say that the major issues passed in the people's congresses at all levels are "finished products" that the Communist Party has prepared in advance and are simply passed at the meetings, making it a "formalistic meeting." Our country is a people's democratic state led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance. The leadership of the working class is realized through the leadership of the Communist Party of China. This is clearly stipulated in the preamble and the general principles of our country's solemn constitution. The Communist Party of China is the core force leading the Chinese people's revolution and socialist construction, which has been affirmed by our country's historic victories and today's great achievements. The constitution consolidates this fact legally. Therefore, our country's leadership by the Communist Party of China is not only due to historical conditions but also affirmed by the country's fundamental law. Anyone who does not isolate themselves from the people should not oppose it. At the same time, since the Communist Party is the party leading the country, what is wrong with it submitting "finished products" to the People's Congress? The proposals submitted by the Communist Party to the People's Congress are merely suggestions. The Communist Party does not impose its suggestions on the People's Congress. The essence of the matter is that the proposals of the People's Congress are not only due to the suggestions of the Communist Party, but also because the suggestions proposed by the Communist Party concentrate and reflect the will and interests of the people of the whole country. Is the constitution drafted and suggested by the Communist Party and adopted by the first session of the National People's Congress not a summary of our country's revolutionary historical experience and a presentation of the fundamental goals of the people's struggle nationwide? Does the first Five-Year Plan formulated and suggested by the Communist Party and adopted by the second session of the National People's Congress not concentrate on reflecting the long-standing wishes and fundamental interests of the people nationwide? The first Five-Year Plan is about to be completed successfully, which even the enemies cannot deny as a huge achievement unprecedented in Chinese history. This precisely demonstrates the correctness of the Communist Party's leadership, and this precisely proves that only the proletarian party—the Communist Party of China—and not the bourgeois parties can truly reflect and represent the highest and long-term interests of the people nationwide. Isn't this obvious enough? At the same time, the suggestions proposed by the Communist Party are merely suggestions before they are passed by the congress. The representatives have the freedom to express their own will. Only after being passed by the majority of the People's Congress does it become a law or resolution formulated by the People's Congress itself. It is implemented by the state administrative organs and is subject to the inspection and supervision of the people's congresses at all levels and the broad masses of people nationwide. May I ask the rightists, what is wrong with this? Do they want the bourgeois parliament, as demanded by the rightists, to pass bills that represent the interests of a few monopoly capitalists? This is not allowed and cannot exist in our socialist country.

The rightists say that in our People's Congress, the motions are only passed as a matter of routine, without any debate, as if the Communist Party is suppressing debate and is afraid of it. The fact is quite the opposite. The Communist Party has always believed that truth becomes clearer through debate, and has always advocated using the democratic method of criticism and self-criticism to clarify right and wrong. The Communist Party has never thought that the proposals it puts forward are perfect and do not need any improvement or development. Many major proposals to be submitted to the National People's Congress are announced nationwide before the congress is convened to allow the whole people to debate. For example, the Constitution and the Model Regulations for Agricultural Producers' Cooperatives were submitted to the broad masses of people nationwide for discussion before they were passed by the National People's Congress. Moreover, during the discussion, all beneficial opinions, even beneficial opinions on wording techniques, were absorbed and adopted. Therefore, such important proposals have already absorbed many beneficial opinions from the people nationwide before they are discussed and passed by the People's Congress; and during the process of the People's Congress, debates are also unfolded in the representative group meetings formed by electoral units. Almost every representative expresses his or her opinion, and many beneficial opinions that require revisions and supplements to the original proposal are adopted. Many impractical opinions and some fallacies are either explained or criticized. We can cite many examples to illustrate this. During the second session of the National People's Congress, didn't some people emphasize greatly increasing investment in education and agriculture and reducing investment in industry? On the surface, it seemed to care about cultural and educational undertakings and the interests of farmers, but in fact, it wanted to hinder or at least postpone the speed of our industrialization, which is a harmful opinion to the interests of the people nationwide, including the interests of farmers. Isn't this a principled debate? This kind of debate precisely reflects a serious class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie on the issue of industrialization. There are many such debates. The bourgeois rightists deliberately obliterate such principled differences and debates in order to cover up their reactionary essence and slander the People's Congress for having no debate and no democracy, and being only a formality. However, the facts ruthlessly answered the bourgeois rightists.

The rightists also say that our state power organs "have no supervision" over the administrative organs and that "it is actually very difficult to supervise." This is another slander by the rightists against our country's political system. We know that our state administrative organs are responsible to the state power organs, are produced and dismissed by the state power organs, and are subject to the supervision of the state power organs. This is one of the characteristics of our socialist country that is different from bourgeois countries. In fact, the people's congresses at all levels in our country have carried out extensive supervision over the work of the people's governments at all levels. When the People's Congress is in session, it listens to, discusses, and examines the reports of the government's work and discusses the motions put forward by the government (such as the annual economic plan, budget, and final accounts). During the discussion, it is inevitable to raise opinions on the government's work. During the recess of the People's Congress, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress also frequently listens to the work reports of the State Council and its subordinate departments, and conducts discussions and puts forward opinions; during the recess of the Congress, the representatives also frequently raise criticisms and suggestions to the relevant government departments based on the problems, shortcomings, and errors they have discovered in the government's work in production, work, and social activities. The Standing Committee receives many letters from the representatives of the National People's Congress every year, and some of them are opinions on the work of the government. These letters have been forwarded to the relevant departments for processing and reference. In addition, the representatives of the National People's Congress and the representatives of the people's congresses of provinces, municipalities directly under the Central Government, and autonomous regions conduct two inspections every year, and the problems found in the inspections are also handed over to the government for handling. How can it be said that our state power organs have not supervised the state administrative organs and that it is actually very difficult to supervise? Obviously, the rightists are still attacking our state power organs for not playing a role and being a formality. At the same time, they are also attacking our state administrative organs, saying that they can act arbitrarily against the will of the state power organs and the people, in order to discredit our country's people's democratic system.

Another poisonous arrow of the rightists' attack is directed at our electoral system, criticizing our country's elections for not being like the "universal suffrage" of capitalist countries, without competition, and therefore undemocratic.

Our country's current electoral system is based on our country's specific conditions and the wishes of the broad masses of people. Our country's grass-roots elections are universal and direct elections. This facilitates the broadest masses of basic laborers to directly participate in the elections, which is essentially different from the hypocritical universal suffrage system of capitalist countries that actually deprives the basic laborers of various restrictions. At the same time, in the grass-roots elections, the area of the township is not large, the population is not large, and the scope is even smaller in the natural village (the cities are districts and streets). The common people usually know very clearly among the people living in their own village and township who is a good person, who is a bad person, who is talented, and whose talent is not enough. Therefore, in the grass-roots direct elections, the common people can express their free will, and it is convenient for them to elect their own representatives. This also makes it easier for good and capable representative figures in their own hometown to be concentrated in the grass-roots people's power organs—the township people's congress. They represent the basic people in exercising their power and participating in the work of managing the country. This kind of universal suffrage at the grass-roots level in our country truly embodies the spirit and essence of democracy. Why? Because it adopts the method of direct elections, because it obtains the actual help of the state for the necessary material conditions for conducting elections, because it is truly free of various restrictions (such as nationality, race, occupation, social origin, religious belief, education level, property status, length of residence, etc.), because it mobilizes all the broadest laborers who directly participate in production to participate in the elections, and makes the representative figures among them who are satisfied by the people be elected. At the same time, as long as someone among the elected violates his promise to the people, or even violates laws and disciplines and does not fulfill his glorious responsibility as a people's representative, the people who participated in electing him as a representative can easily discover his words and deeds and easily dismiss him and re-elect another person to replace him.

Do not forget that the representatives of the people's congresses above the county level in our country are elected by the people's congresses at each level on the basis of such direct universal suffrage and full democracy. Precisely because it is produced on the basis of universal suffrage at the grass-roots level, the indirect elections above the county level can also embody the free will of the basic laborers in our country, can represent the interests of the broad masses of people, and can represent the people in exercising their supervisory power over the administrative organs.

Using the method of consultation to elect candidates is an advantage of our people's representative elections. The candidates for the people's congress above the county level are generated according to the number of places stipulated by the election law. The allocation of places is jointly negotiated by the Communist Party and other democratic parties and people's organizations (such as trade unions, cooperatives, youth, women, culture, education, and other mass organizations) to obtain everyone's agreement. As for who in each unit is to be the candidate, it is up to each unit to nominate them. Generally, the number of people initially nominated is slightly larger. After such democratic methods as deliberation, consultation, discussion, and debate, the candidates for the people's representative at the next level who are nominated are easily familiarized and understood by the people's representatives at the next level. It is easy to distinguish who is more suitable to be elected and who is less suitable, and the bad people who are recognized by the public are not easy to be nominated in each unit, and even if they are nominated, they are not easy to be passed and elected in the People's Congress. Therefore, it can be said that the candidates and elected persons who are truly democratically consulted and carefully considered and nominated can represent the will and interests of the basic masses of workers, peasants, and revolutionary intellectuals in our country.

At the same time, it must also be pointed out that our country's current electoral system has another advantage, that is, it can take care of the minority. Taking the representatives of this National People's Congress as an example, if it were not for following the principle of taking care of the minority and adopting the method of consultation, then some upper-level minority representatives, some representatives of non-Communist democratic parties, and some representatives of the bourgeoisie would be difficult to be welcomed by the basic laborers and would be elected. It is precisely because of the spirit of taking care of the minority and consultation that makes them have appropriate representative places, and these representatives can represent the reasonable interests of the masses they are connected with in the People's Congress. However, the rightists have never been willing and dare to raise objections to the point of taking care of the minority.

Our country is a people's democratic country led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance. In our country, all power belongs to the people. The organs through which the people exercise their power are the National People's Congress and the local people's congresses at all levels. Democratic centralism is practiced in these organs and other state organs. This political system of the People's Congress precisely reflects the superstructure of our country's socialist economic relations and is the broadest and most genuine democratic system. It is precisely because the people of our country rely on this political system that they have achieved the great victories of socialist revolution and socialist construction. In the future, they must also rely on this political system to ensure the construction of a prosperous and happy socialist society in our country. Therefore, we must give a thorough exposure and a merciless counterattack to those rightists who attempt to shake our country's fundamental system.

    驳斥右派对人民代表大会制度的诬蔑
    吴克坚
    资产阶级右派在向党向社会主义猖狂进攻中，对我国的人民代表大会制度，进行了恶毒的攻击，企图动摇我们国家的基本制度，阴谋恢复地主资产阶级的反动制度。
    人民代表大会制，是我们国家的根本政治制度，是全国广大人民群众管理自己的国家的最好的政治组织形式。而右派分子却把它说成是一种形式主义。
    右派分子说，在各级人民代表大会上所通过的重大问题，都是共产党事先搞好了的“成品”，拿来在大会上通过一下，这是“形式主义的会”。我们的国家是工人阶级领导的、以工农联盟为基础的人民民主国家。而工人阶级的领导是通过中国共产党的领导来实现的。这在我国的庄严宪法序言里和宪法总纲中就明确规定了。中国共产党是领导中国人民革命和社会主义建设的核心力量，已为我国历史性的胜利和今日的伟大成就所肯定了的，宪法是从法律上把这种事实巩固下来，所以我国以中国共产党为领导，不仅是由于历史条件所造成，而且也被国家的根本法所肯定，只要是不自绝于人民的谁也不应该反对。同时，共产党既然是领导国家的党，由它向人民代表大会提出
  “成品”，这有什么不好呢？共产党向人民代表大会所提出的议案，仅仅是一种建议，共产党并不以自己所建议的强加于人民代表大会。问题的实质，人民代表大会的议案还不仅是由于共产党所建议的，而是由于共产党所提出的建议，正是集中反映和代表了全国人民的意志和利益。难道由共产党所草拟建议的而为全国人民代表大会第一次会议所通过的宪法，不是总结我国革命历史经验和提出全国人民的根本奋斗目标吗？难道由共产党所制定建议而为全国人民代表大会第二次会议所通过的第一个五年计划，不是集中反映了全国人民多年的愿望和人民的根本利益吗？第一个五年计划即将圆满完成，这连敌人也无法不承认这是中国历史上从来没有过的巨大成绩。这正是显示共产党领导的正确性，这正是证明不是资产阶级的政党而只有无产阶级的政党——中国共产党，才能真正反映和代表全国人民的最高利益和长远利益。这难道还不明显吗？同时，共产党所提的建议，在未经过大会通过以前，仅仅是建议而已，代表们都有表达自己的意志的自由。只有最后经过人民代表大会多数通过，才变为人民代表大会本身所制定的法律或决议。由国家行政机关执行并受到各级人民代表大会和全国广大人民群众的检查和监督执行。试问右派分子这又有什么不好呢？难道非要像右派分子所要求的资产阶级的国会通过那些代表少数垄断资本的利益的议案才好吗？这在我们社会主义国家里是不允许有，而且也是不可能存在的。
  右派分子说，在我们人民代表大会上，议案只有照例通过，没有什么争论，好像共产党有压制现象和害怕辩论似的。事实正相反，共产党一贯认为真理只有愈辩愈明，一贯主张用批评和自我批评的民主方式，辩明是非，共产党也从不以为自己所提出的议案已经是尽善尽美，而不需要任何改进和发展了。许多将提交全国人民代表大会的重大议案，有的是在开大会以前，就公布全国，让全民进行辩论。例如宪法，例如农业生产合作社示范章程等，都是在人代大会通过以前就提交全国广大人民讨论的。而且在讨论中，凡是有益的意见，那怕是文字技巧方面的有益意见，都被吸收采纳。所以像这样重大议案，在人民代表大会讨论通过以前，就已经吸取了全国人民许多有益的意见；而在人民代表大会进行过程中，以选举单位分别组成的代表小组会议上，也是展开辩论的，差不多每个代表都发表了自己的意见，其中许多有益的意见而且又必须对原案进行修改补充的，没有不被采纳的。许多不切合实际的意见和某些谬论，或是受到解释或是受到批判。我们可以举出许多例子加以说明。在全国人民代表大会第二次会议时候，不是有些人强调大大增加教育和农业投资，削减工业投资吗？在表面上看，似乎关心文教事业和农民的利益，实际上是想阻碍至少是推迟我们工业化的速度，这对全国人民利益也包括农民的利益是一种有害的意见。难道这不是一种带有原则性的争论吗？这种争论，正是反映了无产阶级和资产阶级在工业化问题上的一种严重的阶级斗争。像这类的争论是不少的，只不过举一反三罢了。资产阶级右派分子故意抹煞这种原则分歧和争论，以掩盖他们的反动实质，污蔑人民代表大会开会没有争论没有民主，只是形式主义，可是事实却无情地回答了资产阶级右派分子。
    右派分子还说我们国家权力机关对行政机关“没有监督”，“实际上也很难监督”。这是右派分子对我国政治制度的又一诬蔑。我们知道，我们国家行政机关对国家权力机关负责，由国家权力机关产生和罢免，受国家权力机关的监督。这是我们社会主义国家不同于资产阶级国家的特点之一。事实上我国的各级人民代表大会对各级人民政府的工作进行了广泛的监督。在人民代表大会开会时，听取和讨论审查政府工作的报告，要讨论政府提出的议案（如年度经济计划、预决算等），在讨论中就必然要对政府的工作提出意见。在人民代表大会闭会期间，全国人民代表大会常务委员会也经常听取国务院及其所属各部门的工作报告，并进行讨论提出意见；大会闭会期间，代表们还经常根据自己在生产、工作和社会活动中发现的政府工作中的问题或者缺点和错误，向政府有关部门提出批评和建议。常务委员会每年都要收到不少全国人民代表大会代表的来信，其中有一部分便是属于对政府工作提出的意见。这些来信都已转交有关部门处理和参考。此外，全国人民代表大会代表和省、直辖市、自治区人民代表大会代表每年要进行两次视察，在视察中发现的问题，也都交由政府去处理。这怎么能说我们的国家权力机关对国家行政机关没有进行监督，实际上也很难监督呢？很明显，右派分子仍是在攻击我们国家权力机关没有发挥作用，是个形式，同时也是在攻击我们的国家行政机关，把它说成是可以违背国家权力机关和人民的意志而为所欲为，以此来诋毁我们国家的人民民主制度。
    右派分子攻击的另一支毒箭，是射向我们的选举制度，责难我国的选举，不像资本主义国家那种“普选制”，没有竞选，因而是不民主的。
    我国现在的选举制度，是根据我国的具体情况和照顾广大人民的愿望而出发的。我国基层的选举，是普遍的直接的选举。这样就便利于最广大的基本劳动群众有可能直接参加选举，比起资本主义国家实际上用种种限制剥夺基本劳动群众的那种虚伪的普选制是有着本质的不同的。同时，在基层选举里面，乡的地区不大，人口不多，在自然村里，范围就更小（城市是区和街道），老百姓平常就很清楚地知道，在本村本乡范围内聚居的人当中，谁是好人，谁是坏人，谁是有才能的，谁的才能不够。因此，在基层直接选举中，老百姓是能够表现出他们的自由意愿，并且便于他们选出自己的代表的。这样也就便于本乡本土的好人而又会办事的有代表性的人物，比较集中在基层的人民权力机关——乡人民代表大会中来。他们代表基层人民行使自己的权力，参加管理国家的工作。我国基层的这种普选，才真正是充分体现出民主的精神和实质的。为什么呢？因为它是采取了直接选举的方式，因为它获得国家对进行选举所必需的物质条件的实际帮助，因为它是真正没有种种限制（例如民族、种族、职业、社会出身、宗教信仰、教育程度、财产状况、居住期限等），因为它把所有直接参加生产最广大的劳动人民都动员起来参加选举，而又使其中为人民满意的代表人物被选举出来了。同时，只要被选举人中有人违背自己对人民的诺言，甚至违法乱纪不履行自己人民代表的光荣职责的时候，曾经参加选举他为代表的人民，很容易发现他的言行并且易于罢免他们，重新选出另外的人来代替他。
    不要忘记，我国县以上的人民代表大会的代表，就是在这样直接普选、充分民主的基础上经过逐级人民代表大会选举出来的。正因为它是在基层的普选基础上产生的，所以县以上的间接选举，也就能够体现出我国基本劳动群众的自由意志，能够代表广大人民的利益说话，能够代表人民对行政机关行使自己的监督权。
    用协商办法推选出候选人，是我们人民代表选举的一个优点。县以上人民代表候选人的产生，是按照选举法所规定的名额。名额的分配，由共产党及其他各民主党派、各人民团体（如工会、合作社、青年、妇女、文化、教育等群众组织）共同协商，取得大家同意的。至于各单位中那些人作为候选人，则由各单位自己推出，一般起初推出的名额要略多一些。这样经过酝酿、协商、讨论、争辩等民主方式，被推出的上一级人民代表候选人，就容易为下一级人民代表所熟悉了解，容易分别谁比较适合当选，谁比较不适当，而公认的坏人，不仅在各单位不易推举出来，就是推举出来，也不易被人民代表大会上通过当选。所以说这样真正民主协商慎重考虑推举出来的候选人、当选人，是能够代表我国的工人、农民、革命知识分子基本群众的意志和利益的。
    同时，还必须指出，我国现行的选举制度，还有一个好处，就是能够照顾少数。拿这一届的全国人民代表大会的代表来说，如果不是按照照顾少数的这个原则和采取协商的办法，那么，某些上层的少数民族代表，某些非共产党的各民主党派的代表人物，某些资产阶级的代表人物，是很难为基本劳动群众所欢迎而会当选的，正因为采取了照顾少数和协商的精神，使他们都有适当的代表名额，这些代表能在人民代表大会中，有可能代表他们所联系的群众的合理利益。而右派分子却从来不愿也不敢提出反对照顾少数这一点。
    我们的国家是工人阶级领导的、以工农联盟为基础的人民民主国家。在我们国家里，一切权力属于人民。人民行使权力的机关就是全国和地方各级人民代表大会。在这些机关和其他国家机关里都实行民主集中制。人民代表大会的这种政治制度正是反映了我国社会主义经济关系的上层建筑，是最广泛的和真正的民主制度。我国人民正是由于依靠这种政治制度，才取得了社会主义革命和社会主义建设的伟大胜利，今后还必须依靠这种政治制度，才能保证在我国建成繁荣幸福的社会主义社会。因此，对那些企图动摇我们国家基本制度的右派分子，我们必须给予彻底的揭露和无情的反击。
