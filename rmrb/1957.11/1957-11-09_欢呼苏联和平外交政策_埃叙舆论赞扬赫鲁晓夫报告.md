Xinhua News Agency, November 8th, TASS Dispatch from Cairo: Khrushchev's report at the Supreme Soviet celebration has become the center of attention for Egyptian newspapers and has been praised by the public.

    On November 7th, all newspapers published detailed summaries of the report. The headlines of the newspapers pointed out the Soviet Union's peaceful foreign policy and its desire to end the Cold War.

    Husseini Fahmy, editor-in-chief of "People's Newspaper" and member of the National Assembly, published a long article entitled "November 7th." When discussing the Soviet Union's peaceful foreign policy, Fahmy pointed out: "The Soviet Union's selfless assistance to the people striving to break free from colonial oppression is also based on the Leninist principles of the October Revolution." He concluded: "On the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution, the Egyptian people and the entire Arab people declare that they will never forget everything the Soviet Union has done for them, and they congratulate the Soviet people and wish them new and great achievements."

    Cairo's "Evening News" commented on November 7th on the speeches made by Khrushchev, Chairman Mao Zedong, and other leaders of socialist countries at the Supreme Soviet celebration of the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution, saying that these speeches declared the unity and strength of the great socialist camp and affirmed their tasks in defending and strengthening peace and the prosperity of all mankind. The newspaper believes that it is natural to form an alliance between the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and the Asian and African countries, because the Asian and African countries also oppose exploitation, autocracy, and imperialism, and support peace, progress, and prosperity.

    All newspapers in Damascus, Syria, published on November 7th summaries of Khrushchev's report celebrating the 40th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution and Chairman Mao Zedong's speech at the celebration. "Al-Nour" published an editorial and a special issue with articles and pictures to celebrate the festival, praising the progress made by the Soviet Union since the success of the revolution. "Al-Nour"'s editorial said: "We proudly remember the noble position taken by the Soviet Union in supporting the Arab countries since Lenin called on the Muslims of the Middle East to overthrow the slave system and extended a hand of cooperation to them." It also said that the Soviet Union guarantees Syria's freedom with missiles and satellites and with everything possible. With the support of the Soviet Union, "we are more confident that with the great unity and cooperation of the people and the army, with our vigilance and constant state of alert, we will not only crush the conspiracies of these agents, but also the conspiracies of their masters."

    欢呼苏联和平外交政策
    埃叙舆论赞扬赫鲁晓夫报告
    据新华社8日讯　塔斯社开罗讯：赫鲁晓夫在苏联最高苏维埃庆祝会上的报告成为埃及报刊注意的中心，受到公众的赞许。
    各报在7日都详细地刊载了报告的摘要。各报的标题都指出了苏联的和平外交政策和力求结束冷战的意愿。
    “人民报”总编辑、国民议会议员侯赛尼·法米发表了题为“11月7日”的长篇文章。法米在谈到苏联的和平外交政策时指出：“苏联对那些争取摆脱殖民主义压迫的人民的无私援助也是以列宁主义的十月革命的原则为基础的。”他最后写道：“埃及人民和全体阿拉伯人民在十月革命四十周年这一天声明，他们决不会忘记苏联为他们所作的一切，并且向苏联人民致贺，祝他们取得新的巨大成就。”
    开罗的“晚报”11月7日评论赫鲁晓夫、毛泽东主席和其它社会主义国家的领袖们在苏联最高苏维埃庆祝十月革命四十周年纪念大会上的讲话说，这些讲话宣布了巨大的社会主义阵营的团结和力量，肯定了它们在保卫和加强和平和全人类的繁荣方面的任务。这家报纸认为，很自然，应当结成一个以苏联为首的社会主义阵营同亚非国家间的联盟，因为亚非国家也反对剥削、专制和帝国主义，并且支持和平、进步和繁荣。
    叙利亚大马士革所有的报纸11月7日都刊载了赫鲁晓夫所作的庆祝伟大的十月社会主义革命四十周年的报告摘要和毛泽东主席在庆祝大会上发表的讲话。“光明报”发表了社论，并且出版专刊刊载文章和图片来庆祝这个节日，赞扬自从革命成功以来苏联所取得的进步。“光明报”的社论说：“我们自豪地记着自从列宁号召中东的穆斯林推翻奴隶制度并且向他们伸出合作的手以来苏联所采取的支持各阿拉伯国家的崇高立场。”它还说，苏联以导弹和卫星而且以它的一切可能来保障叙利亚的自由。在苏联的支持下，“我们更加相信：有了人民同军队的伟大的团结和合作，有了我们的警惕和不断保持的戒备状态，我们不仅将粉碎这些代理人的阴谋，而且也将粉碎他们的主子们的阴谋”。
