    Another Day in Irkutsk

      (Continued from yesterday)
    There are also beautiful buildings here such as the Art Museum and the History Museum. It is said that the Art Museum has a Chinese section, which houses many Chinese ceramics, calligraphy, paintings, sculptures, embroideries, and the like, as well as an emperor's throne inlaid with jewels.
    There is a one-kilometer-long steel-reinforced concrete Angara Bridge spanning the Angara River. The dim bridge lights are reflected on the blue waters and snow-covered pontoons. The bridge railings are also covered with snow. On the opposite bank, trains come and go, emitting long trails of smoke under the intense spotlights. That is the famous Trans-Siberian Railway. I took its international train and excitedly went to Moscow for the first time.
    We walked from the north side of the bridge back to the south side, and the magnificence of the scenery made us forget the cold of the night wind. Comrade Rima Krashkova, who was leading the way, told me about the myth of the Angara River. It is said that the goddess Baikal had three hundred and sixty sons to accumulate wealth for her (which of course refers to the hundreds of tributaries flowing into Lake Baikal), but one daughter kept spending her wealth, and that was the Angara. She admired the handsomeness of Prince Yenisei and insisted on marrying him. Her mother disagreed, but she did not listen. She traveled one thousand eight hundred kilometers, determined to find the prince. Her mother was furious and raised a stone to smash her, but she finally kicked the stone away and threw herself into the embrace of the Yenisei. Today, at the confluence of the Angara River and the Yenisei River, there is still this huge "sacred stone" remaining. In the past, confused and brutal Tsarist officials used this magical stone to judge prisoners, believing that anyone thrown from the stone who did not sink was innocent and should be released; those who sank were deemed to be caught in the net of heaven, and their crimes deserved punishment.
    Angara's mother, Lake Baikal, is sixty kilometers wide and one hundred and seventy kilometers long. According to the standards of our Beihai, Zhongnanhai, and Shichahai, it should have been called a "sea" long ago, but it modestly calls itself a "lake." It is also the deepest lake in the world, reaching a depth of one thousand eight hundred meters in some places. Although it is freshwater, it produces sea creatures like seals.
    Here, there are six months of winter starting in October, with temperatures dropping to minus forty degrees Celsius at the coldest. However, the climate is dry, and there are no strong winds, so people live comfortably.
    Of course, it was very uncomfortable here in the past. From the perspective of the people in the capital of Petrograd, Irkutsk, more than ten thousand miles away from the capital, was once a wild and desolate place. Therefore, the Tsarist government exiled the Decembrists, Social Revolutionaries, and Communists (Bolsheviks) here one after another. After the failure of the Decembrist revolt, Duke Trubetskoy was exiled to the Nerchinsk iron mine near Irkutsk to do hard labor. The young Duchess Trubetskaya, disregarding the obstruction of relatives and officials along the way, resolutely traveled thousands of miles by horse-drawn carriage through wind and snow to Irkutsk to find her husband; then, Princess Volkonskaya, who was related to Pushkin, also traveled thousands of miles to this place to find her husband. This touching story has been portrayed in the famous work "Russian Women" by the poet Nekrasov. There is also a famous Russian painting called "Volkonsky's Dream," which also depicts this story. According to Rima, Trubetskaya and her two sons are buried here. There are also their relics in the History Museum. In memory of them, there is a "December Events Street" and a "Decembrists Square."
    The Communists (Bolsheviks) who were exiled here included Kirov and Molotov. A memorial square has also been specially established here for Comrade Kirov.
    It is said that these revolutionaries, despite being under the surveillance of Tsarist officials, did not forget to serve the people. They actively organized schools, published small publications, and carried out many enlightenment activities, which played a significant role in Irkutsk's ability to become a city of culture and science today.
    As I write this, a comrade from the delegation comes knocking on the door to inform me that "we can take off, and we need to prepare to board the plane within an hour." Therefore, I have to say to the readers, "See you in Moscow."

    伊尔库次克的又一日
    田汉
      （续昨）
    这里还有美术馆、历史博物馆等美丽建筑，美术馆中据说还有中国部，藏有许多中国陶瓷书画雕刻刺绣之类，还有一个嵌有珠宝的皇帝的御座。
    这里有一座一公里长的钢筋的安哥拉大桥，横跨在安哥拉河上。朦胧的桥灯映在碧流和雪盖的趸船之上。桥栏也积着雪。对岸火车来往吐着长烟起伏在强烈的射灯之下。那就是有名的西伯利亚大铁路。我是坐它的国际列车第一次兴奋地去到莫斯科的。
    我们从桥北走回桥南，风景的壮丽使人忘了夜风的寒冷。领路的丽玛·克拉施柯娃同志对我谈起关于安哥拉河的神话。说相传贝加尔女神有三百六十个替她攒积财富的儿子（那当然是指流入贝加尔湖的几百条支流），却被一个女儿把她的财富不断花掉，那就是安哥拉。她爱慕叶尼塞王子的英俊，定要嫁给他，她母亲不答应，她不听，走了一千八百公里，执意要去找这位王子，她母亲大怒，举起石头去砸她，她终于踢开这石头，投入叶尼塞的怀抱。于今在安哥拉河流入叶尼塞河的江口还留存这个巨大的“神石”，以前糊涂残暴的沙皇官吏在这神奇的石头上处理犯人，认为凡从石上丢下去不沉下的便是无罪，放了他；沉下去的便是天网恢恢，罪有应得。
    安哥拉的母亲贝加尔湖宽六十公里，长一百七十公里，按我们北海、中南海，什刹海的体例，她早该叫做“海”了，但还是谦虚地自称为“湖”。她还是世界上最深的湖，最深处达一千八百公尺。虽是淡水，但产大海豹之类。
    这里从十月里有六个月冬天，最冷时达零下四十度。但气候干燥，没有大风，人们过得很舒服。
    当然以前这里是很不舒服的。从彼得格勒的都人士看来，这一离京一万多里的伊尔库次克，曾是蛮荒烟瘴之地。所以沙皇把十二月党人，社会革命党人，共产党（布）人先后放逐到这里。十二月党人暴动失败后，特洛彼茨柯野公爵被发配到伊尔库次克附近的聂孔斯基铁矿做苦工，年轻的公爵夫人特洛彼茨卡娅，不顾亲友们和沿途官吏百般阻止毅然坐着马车，风雪万里，到伊尔库次克寻找她丈夫；接着和普希金有亲戚关系的奥尔公斯卡娅也同样万里寻夫到此。这一动人的故事曾表现在诗人涅克拉索夫的名作“俄罗斯的女人”之中。俄国有一张名画叫“奥尔公斯基之梦”也写的是这个故事。据丽玛说，特洛彼茨卡娅和她两个儿子的墓还在这里。历史博物馆里也还有他们的遗物。为着纪念他们，这里有一条“十二月事件大街”，还有“十二月党人广场”。
    共产党（布）人曾发配到这里的有基洛夫和莫洛托夫。这里也特为基洛夫同志建立一所纪念广场。
    据说这些革命家被放逐到这里来，尽管在沙皇官吏的监视之下，他们不忘记为人民服务，主动地组织学校，出版小型刊物，做了许多启蒙活动，这对今天伊尔库次克之能成为文化科学城市是起了极大作用的。
    写到这里团的工作同志来敲门通知说“可以起飞了，要在一小时内做好上机的准备”。因此我只好对读者们说：“莫斯科见”。
