News from this newspaper: Hunan Province, based on the preliminary experience gained from the first batch of 800 rectification pilot cooperatives, launched the second batch of 20,000 agricultural cooperatives for rectification in mid-November. This batch of cooperatives includes more than 5,000 third-category cooperatives and second-category cooperatives with more problems, as well as a small number of large cooperatives that need appropriate adjustments in size. The success or failure of this rectification is of great importance to the consolidation of the province's 50,000 agricultural cooperatives. Therefore, Party organizations at all levels attach great importance to it. Beforehand, all localities summarized the experiences and lessons of the first batch and made full preparations. The Provincial Party Committee transferred more than 3,500 cadres to participate in this movement. Each special district and county also transferred more than 40,000 cadres from government agencies with certain rural work abilities to the countryside to participate in the rectification work. Each county also held large-scale three-level cadre meetings to convey the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, carry out vigorous airing of views, big blooming, big contending, improve thinking, boost energy, and study the methods of combining production with rectification. At present, more than 70% of the members of the county party committees throughout the province have gone to townships and cooperatives to guide the movement.

This rectification movement includes three specific tasks: production, rectification, and consolidation of cooperatives. The general approach in various localities is divided into four steps: The first step is to vigorously grasp production, combined with understanding the situation and brewing airing of views. The second step is to comprehensively air views and bloom, combined with rectification and improvement. The third step is to carry out big debates and conduct systematic consolidation of cooperatives. The fourth step is to summarize education. It is expected that before early January, the rectification of the remaining 30,000 cooperatives can be staggered and rolled out in waves.

At present, the rectification in rural areas is beginning to air views. In order to ensure that the rectification is always carried out in the midst of a production upsurge, many places have successively established disciplines or conventions to ensure that production and rectification are not mutually hindered. It is expected that through vigorous airing of views, blooming, contending, and rectification and improvement, the already emerging production upsurge will be pushed to a higher peak.

    湖南两万个农业社开始整风
    许多地方订立公约保证整风生产两不误
    本报讯　湖南省在第一批八百个整风试点社取得初步经验的基础上，11月中旬开展了第二批两万个农业社的整风运动。这批社包括了全省五千多个三类社和问题较多的二类社，以及少部分需要适当调整社队规模的大社。整风的好坏，对全省五万个农业社的巩固关系至为重大。因此，各级党组织都非常重视。事先各地都总结了第一批的经验教训，作了充分的准备工作。省委抽调干部三千五百余人参加这次运动。各专区和县也从机关抽调了四万多名具有一定农村工作能力的干部下乡参加整风工作。各县并开了规模较大的三级干部大会，传达三中全会精神，开展大鸣大放大争，提高思想，鼓足劲头，研究生产结合整风的作法。现在，全省70％以上的县委委员都到乡、社指导运动。
    这次整风运动包括了生产，整风和整社三项具体工作。各地作法一般分为四步：第一步大力抓生产，结合了解情况，酝酿鸣放。第二步全面大鸣大放，结合进行整改。第三步开展大辩论，进行系统整社。第四步总结教育。预计在1月上旬以前，可以波浪式地交错铺开其余三万个社的整风。
    现在农村的整风，正在开始鸣放，许多地方为了使整风始终在生产高潮中进行，纷纷订立保证生产整风两不误的纪律或公约。预计通过大鸣大放大争和整改，已经出现的生产高潮将推向更高峰。
