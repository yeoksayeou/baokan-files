What We See From the National Basketball League By Mou Zuoyun, Deputy Director of the Ball Sports Department of the National Sports Commission

    The 1957 National Basketball League has successfully concluded. In addition to last year's Class A men's and women's teams, this year’s competition included the Chengdu team and Shanghai White team, which were promoted after winning the men's championship and runner-up in last year's Class B competition, as well as the Jiangsu team and Wuhan team, which won the women's championship and runner-up. In the men's division, players from the National Mixed Team, who did not participate in last year's league, also participated this time. Therefore, the lineup for this league appears even more complete and strong. From many intense games, it can be seen that the level of basketball in our country is developing and improving rapidly.

    Although the results of this league did not result in more games with mutual wins and losses, creating a complex situation, the competition was fierce in many games. Due to the close technical levels of the teams, the outcome of the game was sometimes decided in the last few minutes or even seconds. The physical qualities, offensive and defensive skills of the athletes participating in the Class A basketball league, as well as the coaches' on-the-spot command and organization and allocation of on-the-spot strength, and the application of tactics and techniques, have greatly improved compared to last year.

    From this league, it can be seen that in terms of technology, this year's shooting techniques have undergone new changes and improvements. The most significant is the expansion of the shooting area, and the proportion of long-distance shooting in the game has increased. Last year, there were only eight long-distance shots by the men's team in the entire league, with a hit rate of 12.5%. This year, the men's team took 198 long-distance shots in the first 18 games of the preliminary round, with a hit rate of 37.3%. The increase in long-distance shots and the improvement in hit rate show that players have attached importance to long-distance shooting skills. Each team has also cultivated accurate shooting experts, which has created favorable conditions for tactical diversification. Teams can not only shoot long-distance baskets, but also show diverse shooting methods. Many male players can shoot very accurately with one hand while jumping in the mid-range. Female players also have the skill of jumping and shooting accurately with one hand in the air, which are rare moves in international competitions. In addition, the most prominent skill in shooting is the improvement in the combined use of mid-range shooting and cutting movements. Some players use mid-range shooting and cutting movements in very fast actions, often making defenders unpredictable and difficult to defend, thus gaining an offensive advantage. In terms of passing errors, there has been a great improvement this time. The most important thing is that players have a further understanding of the importance of ball possession. The situation of blindly passing and losing the ball, forming a back-and-forth seesaw state, without defense, and only scoring shots, no longer exists this year. Each team has also made progress in defense. The defensive positions are not only well-positioned, but also act actively, preventing dribbling and cutting, and even intercepting the ball. The situation of defending centers is the same, not only can they block the opponent's passes, but also jump in the air and knock the ball out when the opponent gets the ball and shoots. These are advanced defensive techniques. In terms of collective defensive cooperation, when using man-to-man, if the opponent is screened, switching defenses is also very skilled. The most prominent performance this time is the diversification of defensive tactics. Most players can use different defensive tactics according to the specific situation on the spot to achieve victory. For example, in the final between the Beijing men's team and the Shanghai Red team, Beijing adopted a half-court man-to-man defense in the first half, losing by sixteen points at the end. In the second half, they promptly adopted a full-court press man-to-man defense, and instead won by twenty-one points.

    What is exciting is that new forces have grown up. There are many young players with shorter playing experience, especially tall players, in each team. They all have considerable technical skills. The Shanghai White team, with an average age of only twenty, is an example. This shows the widespread development of basketball in our country and the continuous growth of the basketball players. In this league, our most outstanding athletes not only demonstrated good physical qualities and high technical level, but also showed good moral conduct. Many spectators praised the athletes' moral conduct. This shows the improvement of the players in political ideology, which is the result of the Party's care and education for the athletes.

    The league also revealed a number of problems that are worth studying and striving to improve. First of all, the development of athletes' physique is still not enough. Many athletes have good jumping ability, but lack strength training. Some teams ignore endurance and speed training. This problem was not very exposed in the preliminary round, but in the final, the situation of declining performance due to insufficient endurance was very obvious. The second is the center technology problem. In this league, the offensive skills of general centers are too simple. Most centers do not have enough variety in their shooting. Some only know one shooting action, and they cannot use both hands. They are very rigid in their activities under the basket. They cannot move according to the movement of the ball on the outside, and they do not accurately take the position in time, which affects the offensive cooperation of inside and outside passing. Most centers cannot move to the top of the free throw circle to support according to the opponent's defensive situation, which limits the continuity and diversification of offensive tactics and affects the flexible use of tactics. How to grab rebounds in offense and defense is also a question worth studying. Many players only rely on their personal jumping ability to grab rebounds. Some do not know how to judge the time when the ball rebounds from the backboard, how to grab a position under the basket, and how to cooperate with collective strength to attack. At present, the technical level of each team is close, and the diversity of tactical application and the competition for rebounds are even more important.

    In the league, some players showed unstable skills in the game. When the game goes smoothly, all aspects of technology are well-presented, but once the situation changes, the technology fails and they cannot overcome the difficulties on the field at that time. This shows that the athletes' willpower is not strong enough, which will affect the performance of their skills. Therefore, in peacetime training, we must pay attention to the education of athletes' willpower.

    从全国篮球甲级队联赛中看到些什么	国家体委球类司副司长  牟作云
    1957年全国篮球甲级队联赛已胜利闭幕了。参加竞赛的单位除去年甲级男女队外，增加了去年在乙级赛中获得男子冠亚军而升级的成都队和上海白队，女子冠亚军江苏队和武汉队。在男子方面去年没参加联赛的国家混合队队员这次也参加了竞赛。因此这次联赛的阵容更显得整齐壮大。从许多场激烈紧张的比赛中，可以看出我国篮球运动水平在迅速发展和提高。
    这次联赛竞争的结果虽然没有更多场次互有胜负，而形成错综复杂的局面，但从比赛过程来看，很多场比赛是激烈的。由于各队技术水平接近，比赛的胜负有时决定在最后几分钟甚至几秒钟内。参加联赛的甲级篮球队的运动员们身体品质的发挥，进攻和防守技术的掌握，以及教练员的临场指挥工作和对于临场力量的组织、配备，战术和技术的运用都比较去年有很大进步。
    从这次联赛中看到，在技术方面，今年的投篮技术有了新的改变和提高。最显著的是投篮区域扩大，远距离投篮在比赛中所占的比重增加。去年全部联赛中男子队的远距离投篮只有八次，命中率12．5％，而今年男子队在初赛的十八场比赛中，就投了一百九十八次远投，命中率已达37．3％。远投的增加和命中率的提高，说明队员们已重视远投技术。各队也培养了准确的投篮能手，这就为战术多样化创造了有利条件。各队不但能投远篮，而且表现了多样的投篮方式，有许多男队员中距离跳起单手投得很准。女队员也有跳起在空中单手投得很准的技术，这些是国际比赛中少见的动作。另外在投篮上最突出的技巧，是中距离投篮同切入动作互相结合地运用有所提高。有的队员在非常迅速的行动中，运用了中距离投篮和切入动作，常使防守者捉摸不定，难于防守，因此取得进攻的优势。在传球失误方面，这次有很大的改进，最主要的是队员们对珍惜球的得失有进一步的认识。因盲目传失形成往返拉锯状态，没有防守，只是投篮得分的情况，今年已不存在。各队在防守上也有进步。防守位置不但站得好，而且行动积极，能防止过人切入，更能截球。防守中锋的情况也是一样，不但能阻截对方的传球，也能当对方得球后投篮时跳在空中把球扑出。这些都是防守中的高级技术。在集体防守配合方面，采用人盯人时，如果被对方掩护住，交换防守也很熟练。这次表现最突出的是防守战术多样化。大多数队员能根据临场具体不同情况，使用不同的防守战术，以取得胜利。例如，北京男队对上海红队决赛时，上半时北京采用半场盯人防守，结束时输了十六分，下半时及时采用全场紧逼盯人防守，反而胜了二十一分。
    令人感到兴奋的是新生力量已成长起来。各队球龄较短的年青队员特别是高大队员很多，他们都有相当的技术水平，队员平均年龄只有二十岁的上海白队就是一个例子。这说明了我国篮球运动广泛的开展和篮球运动员的队伍在不断的日益壮大。在这次联赛中，我国最优秀运动员不但表现出良好的身体品质和很高的技术水平，而且表现了良好的道德作风。听到许多观众赞扬运动员的道德作风。这说明了队员们在政治思想方面的提高，这是由于党对运动员的关怀和教育的结果。
    从这次联赛中还发现有不少问题是值得研究和努力改进的。首先是运动员体质的发展仍然不够，有许多运动员弹跳很好，但缺少力量训练，有的队忽略耐力和速度训练。这个问题在初赛时暴露还不大，到决赛时因耐力不够影响比赛、成绩逐步下降的情况就暴露得很明显了。其次是中锋技术问题。在这次联赛中看到一般中锋进攻技术过于简单。多数中锋投篮不够多样化，有的只会一种投篮动作，更不能左右手并用，在篮下活动非常呆板，不能根据外围球的移动情况而移动，及时抢位置作得不够准确，影响了进攻上里应外合传接的进攻配合。多数中锋更不能根据对方防守情况移动到罚球顶圈一带进行策应，这就限制进攻战术的连续和多样化，更影响了战术的灵活运用。在进攻和防守时如何抢篮板球，也是值得研究的问题。很多队员只是凭个人弹跳力去抢篮板球，有的不知如何去判断球从篮板反弹回来的时间，以及如何抢站篮下位置，更不知如何配合集体力量去进攻。目前各队技术水平已接近，战术运用的多样和篮板球的争夺就更显得重要了。
    在联赛中，有的队员在比赛中表现技术不巩固。当比赛顺利时，各方面技术表现很好，一旦情况有变化，技术即失常，不能克服当时场上的困难。这说明运动员的意志品质锻炼不够，会影响技术的发挥。所以在平时训练中，一定要重视对运动员的意志品质教育。
