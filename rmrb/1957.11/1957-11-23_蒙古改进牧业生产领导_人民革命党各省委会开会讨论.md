Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, November 21st: The Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party's provincial committees have recently held meetings one after another to discuss the improvement of party organizations' leadership in livestock production and livestock production cooperatives.

Judging from the discussions at the provincial meetings, regions that closely integrate the party's political work, mass work, and the development of livestock production have increased their livestock. For example, Kobdo Province exceeded its livestock breeding plan this year in this way. However, the party and government in some provinces and counties did not attach importance to leading livestock production and did not implement the party's measures to improve livestock production, resulting in a decrease in livestock production.

The discussions at the provincial meetings considered that livestock production cooperatives should play a demonstrative role in increasing livestock among herders. Party organizations should pay close attention to consolidating cooperatives materially and economically.

    蒙古改进牧业生产领导
    人民革命党各省委会开会讨论
    据新华社乌兰巴托21日电　蒙古人民革命党各个省的委员会最近先后召开会议，讨论了改进党组织领导牧业生产和牧业生产合作社的问题。
    从各省会议讨论的情况看来，凡是把党的政治工作、群众工作和发展牧业的生产工作密切结合起来的地区都增殖了牲畜。例如，科布多省就是这样超额完成了今年的牲畜增殖计划。但是有些省县的党和政府没有重视领导牧业生产，没有执行党的有关改进牧业生产的措施，以致牲畜减产了。
    在各省的会议讨论中认为，牧业生产合作社在增畜方面要在牧民中起示范作用。党组织应当十分关注地从物资和经济上去巩固合作社。
