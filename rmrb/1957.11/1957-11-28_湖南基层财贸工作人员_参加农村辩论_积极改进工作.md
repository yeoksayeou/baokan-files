Hunan Grassroots Financial and Trade Workers
Participate in Rural Debates to Actively Improve Work

    (Our report) Hunan's rural grassroots financial and trade workers actively participate in rural socialist debates, listen to the opinions of the masses, and actively improve their work, which is welcomed by the broad masses of farmers. The Financial and Trade Department of the CPC Nanxian County Committee organized more than 200 grassroots financial and trade workers to participate in the debates of 85 agricultural cooperatives. In two evenings, they listened to more than 240 opinions from the masses. After the staff of seven financial and trade units in Sanxianhu Town participated in the debates of five nearby agricultural cooperatives, they immediately formed a special team to study improvement measures. For example, when the masses asked why old ducks were not purchased, the Sanxianhu Town Supply and Marketing Cooperative immediately organized purchases.

    In the debates, all localities tried to resolve those opinions that were correct as soon as possible; a small number of incorrect or erroneous opinions were prepared to be clarified through debate, distinguishing right from wrong, and at the same time explaining policies and answering questions to the masses. This not only improved the socialist consciousness of cadres and the masses, but also laid a favorable foundation for the rectification of grassroots financial and trade workers.

    In mid-October, the CPC Hunan Provincial Committee instructed all localities to actively organize grassroots financial and trade workers in rural areas to participate in the socialist debates in various townships and cooperatives. Zhang Boshen, director of the Provincial Finance, Grain and Trade Office, and Zhang Yichuan, director of the Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative, went deep into Hengshan, Changsha and other counties, townships and cooperatives to listen to the opinions of the masses on grain, financial and trade work, and helped the grassroots improve their work.

    湖南基层财贸工作人员
    参加农村辩论　积极改进工作
    本报讯　湖南农村基层财贸工作人员，积极参加农村社会主义大辩论，听取群众意见，积极改进工作，受到广大农民的欢迎。中共南县县委财贸部组织二百多个基层财贸工作人员，参加了八十五个农业社的辩论，在两个晚上就听取了群众提出的二百四十多条意见。三仙湖镇七个财贸单位的工作人员参加附近五个农业社的辩论后，回去立即组成了专门小组，研究改进办法。如群众提出为什么不收购老鸭，三仙湖镇供销社立即组织收购。
    各地在辩论中，对于一些属于正确的意见，都尽可能及时解决；少数不正确或错误的意见都准备通过辩论，分清是非，并同时给群众说明政策，解答疑问。这样不但提高了干部与群众的社会主义觉悟，并为基层财贸工作人员进行整风打下了有利基础。
    中共湖南省委在10月中旬即曾指示各地积极组织农村基层财贸工作人员，就近参加各乡社的社会主义大辩论。省财粮贸办公室主任章伯森、省供销合作社主任张毅川都深入到衡山、长沙等县乡社听取群众对粮食、财贸工作的意见，帮助基层改进工作。
