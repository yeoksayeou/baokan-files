Uncle Yan Bing

	In March of this year, I went to Manhe Village in the Dai Autonomous Prefecture. One day, Manhe Village was to establish an agricultural production cooperative, and a meeting was held in the evening to sign up. I went to participate.
	It is an extraordinary event for Dai farmers to establish agricultural production cooperatives and enter socialist society. Before liberation, the Dai people were ruled by feudal lords, and all the land belonged to the feudal lords. The farmers living on this land were all serfs of the lords. Serfs had to buy water, buy passage, buy land to live on, and even buy dirt to cover their faces when they died. Some villages were dedicated to cooking, stir-frying dishes, fetching water, and chopping firewood for the lords; some villages were dedicated to raising horses and "ghosts" (ancestral spirits) for the lords; some villages were dedicated to singing and dancing for the lords; some villages were dedicated to wailing when someone died in the lord's house...
	In the past, Manhe Village was specifically responsible for serving as an honor guard, carrying spears and knives for the lords when they went hunting, performing sacrifices, or touring.
	I arrived in Manhe Village after dark. In the subtropical March night, the air was filled with the rich fragrance of fruits and plants. While passing through a dense forest, I suddenly heard someone singing nearby:
	I walk alone at night,
	Accompanied by stars and the moon,
	No girl!
	I feel a little lonely,
	The song I write and sing myself,
	Becomes louder! ...
	The voice was very rough, but he sang carefree and at ease. I guessed he must be a young lad, but when I met him, I saw, by the moonlight leaking through the branches and leaves of the dense forest, that he was actually an old man with a full beard. He wore a Dai farmer's ever-present tool – a double-edged machete – at his waist.
	He was energetic and radiant. When he saw me, he opened his mouth and said, "Comrade, are you going to Manhe Village?"
	I said, "Yes. Old man, what about you?"
	He said, "I am from Manhe Village, I went up the mountain to cut bamboo. I didn't plan to come back, but I was worried and couldn't rest easy. I was afraid my old woman wouldn't do it well, so I hurried back. Comrade, do you think I'm still in time?"
	I was a little confused by his sudden words at first, not knowing what he was referring to. Then I suddenly understood that he was talking about signing up for the cooperative.
	I said, "You're in time, let's hurry."
	We quickened our pace.
	Beyond the dense forest was Manhe Village. We went straight to the township government.
	In the township government's bamboo shed, three bonfires were lit, each surrounded by a circle of people. A table was placed in the center, with two candles lit on it. Several township cadres and work team comrades were sitting next to it.
	Registration had already begun. Each person registering to join the cooperative reported the acreage of land, cattle, population, etc. that they were contributing. Then, they talked about their understanding of the cooperative and their determination. Everyone talked about how the Communist Party and Chairman Mao had led them to turn over a new leaf, and expressed their desire to follow the Communist Party forever and take the socialist road, etc. When saying these words, people had excited and sincere hearts. The light of the bonfires illuminated their faces, and they were so serious, like they were swearing allegiance to socialism.
	After a while, suddenly, from beside a bonfire, the sound of two people arguing in whispers came. I looked closely and saw that it was the old man who came with me, and an old woman arguing. I guessed that the old woman must be his wife. Later, the old woman stopped talking, but the old man kept talking and his voice grew louder, already affecting the order of the meeting.
	"Uncle Yan Bing, what's the matter?" A township cadre said to the old man with a smile.
	"I'm signing up for the cooperative!" Uncle Yan Bing stood up, and said loudly and seriously, and then lowered his head and said angrily to his wife: "You're really getting more and more confused as you get older, still thinking of watching for another year! How can you believe those bad people's words! They say the Communist Party won't last long, that's nonsense!"
	Uncle Yan Bing became more and more angry, and the entire bamboo shed became quiet, with only the crackling of the bamboo burning in the bonfire.
	Suddenly, Uncle Yan Bing pulled out the machete from his waist, swung it up, and chopped it into the wooden pillar beside him. The machete trembled twice and stuck straight into the wooden pillar.
	"Which dog says the Communist Party won't last long, and wants to destroy the life we've just begun to live like human beings. If I hear it again, this machete of mine won't spare him! Who still wants to go back to the old days? Go back to being a slave to the landlord? Call Lao Ba [Note 1] to manage us? Carry spears and knives for the landlord?"
	There was not a sound in the bamboo shed.
	Uncle Yan Bing unbuttoned his coat, revealing his chest. In the flickering firelight, a large scar was deeply etched on it like a pattern.
	"That year, during the Opening Gate Festival [Note 2], the landlord went to the Burmese Temple [Note 3] to worship Buddha. I went to carry the knife. Carelessly, the knife slipped from my shoulder and happened to hit the horse's butt that the landlord was riding. The horse was startled and jumped, throwing the landlord to the ground. The landlord got up, drew his waist knife and slashed me on the chest. I immediately fainted. No one dared to save me at the time, and it wasn't until the landlord finished worshiping Buddha and went back that someone carried me home. But, just as I was carried home and entered the door, the landlord sent a group of people, and they grabbed you..." Uncle Yan Bing lowered his head and looked at his wife, "...and dragged you away forcibly. It wasn't enough to cut me, they also snatched you away to be his house slave. I was lying in the bamboo building with no one to take care of me, and no medicine to treat it, the wound got bigger and bigger, and maggots grew. You were doing hard labor and suffering in the landlord's house, unable to come back..."
	Uncle Yan Bing's voice changed, his eyes turned red. His wife, who was sitting beside him with her head lowered, began to cry softly and sadly. The bamboo shed became even quieter.
	"Fortunately, God has eyes, I didn't die! After a few years, I worked desperately and redeemed you too. Now, the Communist Party has come and liberated us serfs, giving us land, and we can finally live like human beings. Now, Chairman Mao is calling on us farmers to take the socialist road, to establish cooperatives, and to live a better life. There's nothing wrong with that, I, Yan Bing, should be the first to sign up. Who would have thought you would listen to the words of bad people, wanting to wait and see for another year! Luckily I came back! Those damned bad people!..."
	The light of the bonfire illuminated Uncle Yan Bing's excited face, and illuminated the shining machete stuck in the wooden pillar.

	[Note 1] Lao Ba: The headman in charge of the village, who works for the landlord.
	[Note 2] Opening Gate Festival: A Dai festival.

    今年3月，我到傣族自治州曼贺寨去。有一天，曼贺寨要成立农业生产合作社，晚上召开报名入社大会，我去参加了。
    傣族农民成立农业生产合作社，跨进社会主义社会，这是一件非常不平常的事。解放以前，傣族被封建领主统治，所有的土地都属于封建领主。生活在这片土地上的农民，全是领主的农奴。农奴必须向领主买水吃，买路走，买地住，人死了也要买土盖脸。有的寨子专门给领主做饭、炒菜、挑水、砍柴，有的寨子专门给领主养马、养鬼（供祖先），有的寨子专门给领主唱歌、跳舞，有的寨子专门在领主家死了人的时候去哭嚎，……
    曼贺寨过去是专门在领主游猎、祭祀、出巡的时候，给领主当仪仗队、抬矛扛刀的。　　我去曼贺寨，天已经黑了。亚热带3月的夜晚，空气里飘散着浓郁的水果和草木的香味，在穿过一带密林的时候，忽然从附近传来一个人的歌声：
    我独自夜间行走，
    伴着星儿和月亮，
    没有姑娘！
    心中有些寂寞啊，
    自编自唱的歌儿，
    就越响亮！…………
    声音很粗犷，但唱得无忧无虑地挺自在。我猜想一定是个年青的小伙子，可是当和他碰头的时候，借着从密林的枝叶间漏下的月光一看，原来却是位长满胡须的老头子。腰间别着一把傣族农民不离身的农具——两面刃的砍刀。
    他精神抖擞，容光焕发，见到我，首先开口说：“同志，去曼贺寨，是吗？”
    我说：“是的。老大爷，你呢？”
    他说：“我是曼贺寨的人，上山砍竹子去了。本来不打算回来，可是又放心不下，怕我老伴办不好，到底还是赶回来了。同志，你看，还赶的上吗？”
    对他这番没头没脑的话，起初我有些茫然，不知他指的是甚么，随即我就恍然大悟了，他说的是报名入社的事。
    我说：“赶的上，咱们快点走吧。”
    我们加快了脚步。
    过了密林，就是曼贺寨。我们直奔乡政府。
    乡政府的竹棚里，点着三堆篝火，每堆围着一圈人。正中放一张桌子，点着两只蜡烛，旁边坐着几个乡干部和工作组的同志。
    报名已经开始了，每个报名入社的人，报出入社的田亩、耕牛、人口等等。然后讲一讲对社的认识和决心。每个人都讲到是共产党毛主席领导他们翻了身，表示要永远跟着共产党走，走社会主义的道路等等，说这些话的时候，人们都怀着一颗激动的、真诚的心。篝火的光焰照亮他们的面颊，他们是那样的严肃，像是向社会主义宣誓。
    过了不久，忽然从一堆篝火旁边，发出两个人小声争吵的声音。我仔细看了看，原来是和我同来的那个老头，和一个老太婆在争吵。我猜想这个老太婆一定就是他的老伴了。后来老太婆不说话了，可是老头仍不停的说着，并且越说声音越大，已经影响了会场的秩序。
      “岩丙大叔，甚么事啊？”一个乡干部笑着对老头说。
      “我报名入社！”岩丙大叔站起来，很严肃地大声说，然后低头又对着他的老伴气愤愤地说：“你真是越老越糊涂了，还三心二意的想看一年！那些坏人的话怎么能相信！他们说共产党长不了，这是胡扯！”
    岩丙大叔越说越气愤，整个竹棚里都安静了，只有篝火中燃烧的竹子毕毕剥剥的响着。
    突然，岩丙大叔抽出别在腰间的砍刀，抡起来，砍在身旁的木柱上，砍刀震颤了两下，直直的嵌在木柱上。
      “哪个狗东西说共产党长不了，想破坏我们刚刚过得像个人似的生活，若是让我再听到了，我这把砍刀可不饶人！有谁还想再回到过去的日子？再去当领主的奴隶？叫老叭〔注一〕来管？给领主抬矛扛刀？”
    竹棚里没有一点声响。
    岩丙大叔解开上衣的纽扣，露出前胸，在火光闪耀中，上面像图案似的深绘着一块很大的疤痕。
    “那年开门节〔注二〕领主到缅寺〔注三〕拜佛，我去扛刀，一不小心，刀从我的肩膀上滑下来，凑巧打在领主骑的马屁股上，马惊了，跳起来，把领主摔在地下。领主爬起来，抽出他的腰刀就在我胸上砍了一刀，我立刻昏死过去。当时没人敢来救我，直到领主拜完佛，回去了，才有人把我抬回家来。可是，把我抬到家里，刚刚进门，领主就派来一群人，把你……”岩丙大叔低头看着他的老伴，“死拉活扯的抢走了。砍伤了我还不算，又把你抢去给他当了家奴。我躺在竹楼上没人服侍，又没药医治，伤口越烂越大，生了蛆。你在领主家做苦工受罪，不能回来，……”
    岩丙大叔的声音变了，眼圈红了，低头坐在他身旁的他的老伴，低声的悲痛的哭起来。竹棚里更静了。
      “还好，老天有眼，我没有死！过了几年，我拚命的干活，把你也赎了出来。现在，共产党来了，把咱们农奴解放了，分给咱们土地，咱们才过上了像个人似的生活。现在，毛主席号召咱们农民走社会主义道路，成立合作社，过更好的日子，没有错，我岩丙应该抢先第一个报名。谁想你听信坏人的话，要看一年再说！幸亏我赶回来了！该杀千刀的坏人！……”
    篝火的光焰照耀着岩丙大叔激动的脸，照耀着砍在木柱上那把闪光的砍刀。
    〔注一〕老叭：管辖村寨的头人，替领主办事的。
    〔注二〕开门节：傣族的节日。
              傣历9月15日为“关门节”，从这天起关起爱情和婚
            姻之门，不能再谈情说爱，要集中全力进行农业生产。
            傣历12月14日为“开门节”，此时农忙已过，从这天起
             ，关了三个月的爱情之门又重新开放了。
    〔注三〕缅寺：佛寺。
