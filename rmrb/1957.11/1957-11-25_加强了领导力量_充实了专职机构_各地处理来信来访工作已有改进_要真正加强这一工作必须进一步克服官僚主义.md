Xinhua News Agency, November 24th: Preliminary achievements have been made by Party and government organs across the country in improving the handling of people's letters and visits.

    All regions and central government agencies across the country have convened meetings to convey the spirit of the National Conference on Handling People's Letters and Visits held in May this year by the General Office of the CPC Central Committee and the General Office of the State Council. They have also summarized past experiences, criticized bureaucracy in their work, and enhanced their ideological understanding of handling people's letters and visits. In accordance with the spirit of correctly handling contradictions among the people, they have established several specific measures to strengthen and improve this work, and these measures have been gradually implemented.

    First, all regions have strengthened leadership over this work, emphasizing that leaders should take personal action. Currently, twenty-six provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities have reported the list of leaders (CPC Party secretaries, vice-governors, vice-mayors, vice-chairmen of autonomous regions) in charge of this work to the central government. All regions have stipulated that leaders at the provincial, municipal, and county levels should be assigned to oversee this work. Henan, Shandong, Qinghai, and other provinces have established a system for governors and vice-governors to read people's letters and regularly meet with visiting masses. From May to July, Henan Province's governors and vice-governors took turns meeting with visiting masses sixteen times. The system of leaders of Party and government organs below the provincial level regularly meeting with visiting masses has been gradually promoted. For example, forty-six counties in Shandong Province have established a system for county heads to regularly meet with visiting masses, and twenty-three counties have established a system for county Party secretaries to regularly meet with visiting masses. In Henan Province, four special districts, four cities, and seventy counties have implemented a system where commissioners, mayors, and county heads personally handle people's letters and meet with visiting masses. Various regions have also commended leaders who have personally taken charge of this work and achieved significant results. For example, Longyan County in Fujian has implemented a "County Head Reception Day" since 1952 and has persisted with it to this day. The county head of Huang County in Shandong receives visiting masses on the first and fifteenth of each lunar month and has persisted with this since 1953. The Deputy County Head of Henan Mongolian Autonomous County in Qinghai Province, Gabulong (Mongolian), has received more than 1,550 visiting masses and personally handled more than 400 major disputes in the field in the two years since the second half of 1955.

    The specialized agencies in various regions that handle people's letters and visits have been strengthened. Most regions have strengthened the specialized agencies in this area and filled the ranks of cadres while reducing the staffing of government agencies, based on the principle of seeking truth from facts. The Qinghai Provincial People's Committee originally had only three cadres doing this work, but now has increased that to five. The Henan Provincial People's Committee originally had three full-time cadres, but now has increased that to eight. Sichuan Province stipulates that leadership organs above the county level should generally set up specialized agencies and full-time cadres to handle people's letters and visits. Anhui Province stipulates that organs above the county level that handle more than 150 cases (visits) of people's letters and visits each month should be equipped with full-time cadres with certain political qualities. Many places have also proposed that cadres engaged in this work should remain stable and avoid frequent transfers in order to accumulate work experience.

    Another measure to improve this work is to solve some prominent problems in the current work and improve working methods. For example, at the conference on people's letters and visits in Tianjin, the heads of the relevant departments gave special speeches on the issues of migrants going to Qinghai, labor employment, and the enrollment and employment of middle and primary school graduates, and put forward principles and methods for handling them. At the conference on people's letters and visits in Sichuan Province, the legacy problems of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements were studied, the situation was analyzed, the boundaries between right and wrong were clarified, and the methods for handling them were determined. The study and resolution of these problems has greatly helped the staff of lower-level institutions. In terms of improving working methods, all regions have affirmed that handling people's letters and visits must implement a combination of specialized agencies and full-time personnel being responsible and mobilizing everyone to take action. While stipulating the "centralized handling" method, many regions emphasize "handling more and forwarding less." The staff of the CPC Municipal Committee and the Municipal People's Committee in Zhangzhou City, Fujian Province, adopted the method of "handling more and forwarding less," often going deep into the masses to understand the situation, handling some problems on the spot, which is highly efficient and does not delay the masses' production. Hebei Province has strengthened the handling of people's letters and visits in counties and cities, thus reducing the trouble of the masses appealing to higher-level organs back and forth, which is both convenient for the masses and saves the masses' time, energy, and financial resources.

    In addition, many regions have formulated some methods and regulations to improve the working system, and some regions have also made some regulations on clearing backlogged letters and improving work efficiency. For example, Guizhou and Hubei provinces stipulate that letters that generally need to be forwarded should be forwarded within three to five days and must not be backlogged. Sichuan Province stipulates that letters accusing cadres below the county level should be handled separately by the county supervisory committee and the county people's committee and must not be forwarded to lower levels to avoid retaliation.

    However, the current improvement and strengthening of the handling of people's letters and visits in various regions is only a beginning. The working conferences held in various regions mainly solved the two problems of strengthening leadership and strengthening specialized agencies and staffing cadres, and other related problems have not been solved much. Some of the regulations made at the meeting are relatively easy to implement, while others will encounter considerable resistance, and this is the bureaucratic style of thinking of many cadres. Therefore, state organs at all levels must seize the key rectification stage of the rectification movement, resolutely and thoroughly criticize the bureaucratic style of thinking of cadres, vigorously conduct supervision and inspection, implement the various correct regulations that have been made, and pay attention to continuing to study and solve various practical problems in the work. In this way, we can truly greatly strengthen the handling of people's letters and visits, achieve the purpose of more closely linking with the masses, promoting a good style of work, improving work, and strengthening leadership over the construction of socialist cause.

### 加强了领导力量  充实了专职机构  各地处理来信来访工作已有改进  要真正加强这一工作必须进一步克服官僚主义

    加强了领导力量  充实了专职机构
    各地处理来信来访工作已有改进
    要真正加强这一工作必须进一步克服官僚主义
    新华社24日讯　全国各地党和政府机关改进处理人民来信、接待人民来访的工作，已经获得初步成绩。
    全国各地区和各中央机关都召开会议，传达了今年5月间中共中央办公厅和国务院秘书厅召开的全国处理人民来信、来访工作会议的精神，并且总结了过去的经验，批判工作中的官僚主义，提高对处理人民来信、来访工作的思想认识；并根据正确处理人民内部矛盾的精神，确定了若干加强和改进这一工作的具体办法，这些办法已经逐步着手实行。
    各地首先加强了对这一工作的领导，强调领导人员亲自动手。目前已经有二十六个省、自治区、直辖市将分工掌管这项工作的领导人员名单（中共党委书记、副省长、副市长、自治区副主席）报到中央。各地区都规定从省、市级机关到县都要由一位领导干部分工掌管这项工作。河南、山东、青海等省建立了省长、副省长批阅人民来信和定期接见来访群众的制度，河南省从5月到7月，省长、副省长轮流接见来访群众十六次。省以下党、政机关领导人定期接见来访群众的制度，已在逐步推广。如山东省有四十六个县建立了县长定期接见来访群众日制度，有二十三个县建立了县委书记定期接见来访群众日制度。河南省有四个专署、四个市和七十个县，实行了专员、市长、县长亲自处理人民来信和接见来访群众的制度。各地还表扬了一些亲自动手抓这项工作，做得很有成绩的领导人员。如福建龙岩县从1952年起实行“县长接待群众日”，一直坚持到现在。山东黄县县长每月初一、十五（旧历）接待群众来访，从1953年坚持到现在。青海省河南蒙古族自治县副县长尕布龙（蒙族），自1955年下半年以来，在两年多的时间内，接见来访群众一千五百五十多人，亲赴现场处理了四百多件较重大的纠纷案件。
    各地处理人民来信、来访工作的专职机构都已得到加强。多数地区都在紧缩机关编制人员的前提下，实事求是地加强这个方面的专职机构，充实了干部力量。青海省人民委员会原来只有三个干部做这项工作，现在增加到五个干部。河南省人民委员会原有三个专职干部，现增加为八个。四川省规定县以上领导机关一般应设专职机构和专职干部来处理人民来信、来访工作。安徽省规定县以上机关每月处理人民来信、来访在一百五十件（次）以上的，应配备具有一定政治质量的专职干部。许多地方还提出，担任这一项工作的干部，应该保持稳定，避免经常调动，以积累工作经验。
    改进这一工作的另一措施是解决当前工作中的一些突出问题和改进工作方法。例如天津市在人民来信、来访工作会议上对去青海的移民问题，劳动就业问题，中、小学毕业生的升学、就业问题，由各主管部门负责人作了专题发言，提出处理原则和办法；四川省在人民来信、来访工作会议上对于“三反”、“五反”的遗留问题进行了研究，分析了情况，分清是非界线，确定了处理办法。这些问题的研究和解决，对下级机构的工作人员帮助很大。在改进工作方法方面，各地都肯定处理人民来信、来访工作，必须实行专职机构、专职人员负责与发动大家动手相结合的办法。许多地区在规定“归口交办”办法的同时，强调“多办少转”。福建省漳州市的中共市委和市人民委员会处理人民来信、来访工作的人员采取“多办少转”办法，经常深入群众了解情况，有些问题就地处理，工作效率高，又不耽误群众生产。河北省加强了县、市处理人民来信、来访的工作，这样，减少了群众向上级机关往返申诉的麻烦，既便利群众，又节省群众的时间、精力和财力。
    此外，许多地区对健全工作制度方面制定了一些办法和规定，有的地区还对清理积压信件和提高工作效率作出了一些规定。如贵州、湖北两省规定，一般需要转的来信，应在三五天内转出，不得积压；四川省规定控告县以下干部的来信，分别由县监察委员会和县人民委员会处理，不得下转，以免造成打击报复等等。
    但是，目前各地改进和加强人民来信、来访工作的处理还只是一个开始。各地区召开的工作会议主要是解决了加强领导和加强专职机构、充实干部力量两个问题，其他有关的问题解决的还不多。会议作出的规定，有的比较容易实现，有的还会遇到相当大的阻力，这就是不少干部中的官僚主义思想作风。因此，各级国家机关都必须抓紧在整风运动的着重整改阶段，坚决地、彻底地批判干部中的官僚主义思想作风，大力进行督促、检查，把已经作出的各项正确规定贯彻下去，并注意继续研究解决工作中的各种实际问题。这样，才能真正大大加强处理人民来信、来访工作，达到更密切地联系群众，发扬优良作风，改进工作，加强对建设社会主义事业的领导的目的。
