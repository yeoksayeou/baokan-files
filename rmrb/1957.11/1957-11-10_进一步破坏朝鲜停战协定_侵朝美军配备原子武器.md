    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 9th. Seoul News: General White, Commander of the U.S. Army Forces in the Pacific, said at a press conference in Seoul on the 8th that the two U.S. Army divisions in Korea had been partially equipped with weapons capable of firing atomic warheads. He said that after obtaining the necessary items, these troops would be fully equipped with atomic weapons.

    In June of this year, when the United States openly announced the destruction of the Korean Armistice Agreement's clause regarding the prohibition of bringing reinforcing weapons into Korea, it stated that it would deliver rockets and missiles capable of launching atomic and ordinary warheads to the American troops in Korea. These two U.S. Army divisions have been reorganized into "pentomic divisions".

    进一步破坏朝鲜停战协定
    侵朝美军配备原子武器
    据新华社平壤9日电　汉城消息：太平洋美国陆军部队总司令怀特8日在汉城召开的记者招待会上说，在朝鲜的两师美国军队已经部分地用能够发射原子弹头的武器装备起来。他说，在得到必要的东西以后，这些军队将全部配备原子武器。
    今年6月间，美国在公然宣布破坏朝鲜停战协定中关于不得以增援性武器运入朝鲜的条款的时候，曾经表示要把能够放射原子弹头和普通弹头的火箭和导弹运交在朝鲜的美国军队。这两师美军已经改编为“五单位制原子师”。
