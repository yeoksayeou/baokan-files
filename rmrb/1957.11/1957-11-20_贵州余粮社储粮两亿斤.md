Xinhua News Agency Report:

    Guizhou Province's agricultural cooperatives in most areas are storing grain for disaster preparedness during the autumn harvest distribution. This year, in addition to setting aside seeds, rations for members, and fulfilling the state's procurement tasks, surplus grain cooperatives across the province have set aside approximately 200 million jin of grain for reserves. Among them, agricultural cooperatives in the Zunyi area have stored 40 million jin of grain, while the Qian Dongnan and Qiannan minority autonomous prefectures have stored around 30 million jin. In Zunyi County, 70% of agricultural cooperatives have set aside grain for disaster preparedness. The Da Zi Ran cooperative in this county, with 2,553 people, has stored 150,000 jin of grain, accounting for 5.7% of the cooperative's total grain production. Many cooperative members are also voluntarily storing 50 to 200 jin of grain per household.
  Guizhou had a bumper grain harvest this year, with an increase of 850 million jin compared to last year. After the agricultural cooperatives set aside reserves, the members' rations are still slightly higher than last year, with no impact on their lives. Cooperative members everywhere happily said: If we continue to store like this for a few more years, we won't be afraid of even the biggest disasters.
    Guizhou's mountainous areas constantly experience natural disasters every year. Crops are often affected by water, drought, wind, hail, insects, and animals. In years with particularly severe disasters, there may even be reduced production. Therefore, in the past, farmers of all ethnic groups in Guizhou Province generally had the habit of storing grain to prevent famine. Last year, half of the agricultural cooperatives in the Qiandongnan Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture set aside grain reserves.

    贵州余粮社储粮两亿斤
    据新华社讯　贵州省绝大多数地区的农业社，在秋收分配中储粮备荒。全省余粮社今年除了留足种籽、社员口粮、完成国家的征购任务以外，留出的储备粮约两亿斤左右。其中，遵义专区的农业社储存粮食四千万斤，黔东南、黔南两个少数民族自治州储粮也在三千万斤上下。遵义县70％的农业社都留下备荒粮，这个县的大自然社二千五百五十三人，储粮十五万斤，占全社粮食总产量5．7％。许多农业社的社员还在自愿基础上，每户储备五十斤到二百斤的粮食。
  贵州今年粮食丰收，比去年增产八亿五千万斤。各农业社留出储备粮后，社员的口粮仍比去年略有增加，对生活并无影响。各地社员高兴地说：这样再储几年，再大的灾荒也不怕了。
    贵州山区自然灾害每年不断，农作物常受水、旱、风、雹、虫、兽等灾侵袭，遇上灾害特大的年成，还有减产可能。因而过去贵州省各族农民一般都有积谷防荒的习惯，去年黔东南苗族侗族自治州就有半数农业社留出了储备粮。
