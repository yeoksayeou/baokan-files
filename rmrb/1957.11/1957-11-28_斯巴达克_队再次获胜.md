"Spartak" Team Wins Again
    (Our Newspaper) On the afternoon of the 27th, the "Spartak" football team of Minsk, Belorussian SSR, defeated the Changchun team with a score of 1-0. This was the second friendly match of the "Spartak" team in Beijing.
    Three minutes after the kickoff, the guest team's right forward Dubrovsky made a powerful shot from six meters away from the goal. However, this very dangerous ball was accurately caught by goalkeeper Xu Fusheng. After Xu Fusheng got the ball, he passed it to the forward. Center forward Li Guangzhu received the ball in the midfield and dribbled it to fifteen or sixteen meters away from the guest team's goal. He raised his foot and slammed the ball, but unfortunately, the ball was slightly higher and grazed the crossbar out of bounds. After that, the home team took advantage of the favorable wind and launched a fierce attack. Except for leaving defender Jin Rongzhi to watch the guest team's center forward Nikulenko, the entire team pressed over the midline and launched a fierce attack. With the cooperation of the whole team, Li Guangzhu and Pu Wanshi's powerful shots repeatedly forced corner kicks. The guest team was indeed under a relatively serious threat, and they had to relax their attack and strengthen their defense. In the first half, both sides made no achievements for over thirty minutes. At the fortieth minute, the players from both sides fiercely fought in front of the home team's goal. The guest team's multiple rushes failed to break through the home team's defense. In the melee, the guest team's left forward Yelokhavets kicked the ball to the left side of the home team's goal, where the guest team's right-winger Korneev happened to catch it. At this time, the home team's defender Fang Zhengxun not only did not press up to watch him, but retreated to defend instead. Korneev calmly scored a goal without anyone guarding him. Xu Fusheng was unable to save it in time because his vision was blocked. The ball flew into the net from the upper right corner of the goal. The first half ended with a score of 1-0.
    In the second half, the guest team launched a major attack, taking advantage of the favorable wind. The home team adopted a tactic of strengthening defense and waiting for opportunities to attack. Therefore, in the entire second forty-five minutes, the home team's goal was often crowded with people and short-range contact. Under the home team's strong defense, the guest team's several dozen minutes of siege failed to score a single goal. The home team also failed to put the ball into the opponent's goal in the second half. The score of 1-0 was maintained until the end of the game.
    The Changchun team played relatively successfully yesterday. They ran actively, competed for every ball, and passed quickly. In addition, their defenders were positioned very well and successfully blocked the guest team's multiple attacks.

    “斯巴达克”队再次获胜
    本报讯　27日下午，苏联白俄罗斯明斯克市“斯巴达克”足球队以一比○胜长春队。这是“斯巴达克”队在北京的第二场友谊比赛。
    开球后三分钟，客队右锋杜布洛夫斯基就在距门六公尺处劲射，这个十分危险的球，却被守门员徐福生准确地接住了。徐福生得球后一脚遥递前锋，中锋李光洙中场接得来球，盘带到距客队大门十五六公尺处举脚猛扣，可惜球稍高擦过横木越出界外。此后，主队乘顺风之势连续发动了猛烈的进攻，除留下后卫金荣枝看住客队中锋尼库连柯外，全班人马压过中线进行猛攻猛打，在全队的配合下，李光洙、朴完植的劲射，曾经多次地迫成了角球。客队确实受到了比较严重的威胁，他们不得不放松进攻加强防守。上半场三十几分钟双方都无建树。到了第四十分钟时，双方队员在主队门前剧烈争夺，客队多次的猛冲都没有突破主队的防线，在混战中，客队左锋耶洛哈维茨把球踢到主队大门的左边，正好客队右翼科尔涅也夫接着，这时主队后卫方正勋不但不紧迫上去把他看住，反而向后退守，科尔涅也夫在没有人看守的情况底下从容不迫地一蹴，徐福生因为视线被挡来不及扑救，球从门右上角飞入网内。上半场以一比○结束。
    下半场客队借顺风之势大举进攻。主队采取了加强防守伺机进击的战术。因此，在整个后四十五分钟中主队门前经常是人马云集、短兵接触。在主队的有力的防守下，客队的几十分钟的围攻，始终没有打中一球。主队在后半场时，也没有把球攻入对方的大门。一比○的比数一直维持到终场。
    长春队昨天踢得比较成功，他们跑动积极，每球必争和传递迅速，另外他们的后卫位置站得很好，成功地挡回了客队的多次进攻。
