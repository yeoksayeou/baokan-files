    Food Production Increases Rapidly, Supplies Become Increasingly Abundant
    Soviet Union Further Reduces Meat Prices
    (People's Daily, Moscow, November 1st) On the eve of the fortieth anniversary of the Great October Revolution, the Soviet people received a new holiday gift. The Soviet government announced another price reduction. Starting November 1st, the average price of various meat products was reduced by another 11%–15%, and goose and duck meat products were reduced by 12.5%. Top-grade pork was reduced from 21 rubles per kilogram to 18 rubles, beef and mutton from 18 rubles and 50 kopecks per kilogram to 16 rubles, and goose meat from 12 rubles per kilogram to 10 rubles. At the same time, the price of ham, bacon, etc., was also reduced by 14%–15%. Restaurants and public canteens have correspondingly changed the new prices on their various meat menus. This reduction in the price of various meat products will save the Soviet people more than 500 million rubles in one year.
    In April, September, and October of this year, the Soviet government successively reduced the prices of various meats, fish, canned foods, and other items. This year's price reductions for various foods will save the people a total of 1 billion rubles in one year. In addition to the price reductions for various foods this year, the prices of radios, clocks, vacuum cleaners, and various electrical appliances for daily use have also been reduced.
    This latest price reduction for meat and other foods proves that the Soviet Union's food production is rapidly increasing and the daily necessities of the people's lives are becoming increasingly abundant. For example, this year's meat purchases have reached 624,000 tons, an increase of 38% over the same period last year, and cattle have also increased by 19%.
