Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 4th. The famous Soviet film director Sergei Apollinarievich Gerasimov recently told our reporter that the development of Soviet film is a living history of the era and a reflection of reality. For forty years, Soviet films have played an unparalleled role in educating the people, raising the communist consciousness of the masses, and broadening the horizons of the audience.

Gerasimov said that Soviet films take serving the people and actively participating in communist construction as their highest purpose, because film is the most powerful weapon for educating the masses, and it directly appeals to the people, and everyone can understand it. The source and moving power of Soviet film creation lies in its true reflection of our bright new life and in its communist ideology.

Gerasimov said that Soviet films were produced after the October Revolution. In the early days, the Soviet Union shot some documentaries about the domestic war and the life of Lenin, which have now become valuable historical documents. The Soviet Union began producing feature films in the 1920s. The successful production of "Battleship Potemkin" and "Mother" was a victory for the Soviet film industry and paved the way for the development of Soviet films on the basis of socialist realism. Sound films appeared in the 1930s, and the film "Chapayev" was produced, which marked the establishment of the socialist realism creative method in film and was an important stage in the development of Soviet film. Subsequently, excellent films such as "The Maxim Trilogy," "Baltic Deputy," and "Road to Life" appeared. The 1930s were a period of vigorous development of Soviet films, which was due to the upsurge in domestic political life, which was the period of national industrialization and agricultural collectivization.

Gerasimov said that with the development of political life, films such as "Party Card" and "The Great Citizen" appeared, as well as comedies such as "Volga-Volga," "Happy People," and new films with various themes and styles. During the Great Patriotic War, the Soviet Union shot many military documentaries, and after the war, films depicting the restoration of the national economy were produced.

Gerasimov said that after the 20th Congress of the CPSU, film creation was higher than ever. If the Soviet Union had produced ten films a year after the Great Patriotic War, now it can produce about one hundred new feature films every year. During this period, many talented new actors and excellent film workers emerged, who will become the successors of the older generation. The characteristics of the films in this period are the diversification of styles, themes, and expressions. The films show the lives of modern people, such as the reclamation of virgin land, the friendship of all nationalities, and the defense of peace. The film industry in the various republics has also developed greatly. Most of the republics have established film studios and produced many good films.

Gerasimov also said that now, Soviet film workers are creating works to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution. There are dozens of films dedicated to the October Revolution Day, such as "Two Sisters," "Born of the Storm," "Communists," "Stories about Lenin," and "Days of October." The two parts of "Quiet Don" that I directed have been filmed, and the final part can be completed by the end of the year.

The famous director finally said that when the Soviet people commemorate the October Revolution Day, they are most likely to think of their close friend—China. The people of China and the Soviet Union are the closest. My visit to China after the founding of New China has become the happiest memory of my life. He also said that Chinese films have made great progress compared with the early days of the founding of the country. Chinese films have developed in terms of plot and characterization. The Chinese films I have seen recently are all of high quality.

### 提高群众共产主义觉悟  真实反映光辉的新生活  苏联电影发挥了巨大作用

    提高群众共产主义觉悟  真实反映光辉的新生活
    苏联电影发挥了巨大作用
    新华社莫斯科4日电　苏联著名电影导演谢·阿·格拉西莫夫最近对本社记者谈话时指出，苏联电影的发展是一部活的时代的历史，是现实的反映。四十年来，苏联电影在教育人民、提高群众的共产主义觉悟和扩大观众眼界方面，起了无可比拟的作用。
    格拉西莫夫说，苏联电影把为人民服务和积极参加共产主义建设作为最高目的，因为电影是教育群众的最有力的武器，它直接号召人民，每个人都能看得懂。苏联电影创作的源泉和感人的力量就在于它真实地反映我们光辉的新生活，在于它的共产主义思想。
    格拉西莫夫说，苏联电影是十月革命后产生的。在初期，苏联拍摄了一些有关国内战争和列宁生活的纪录片，这些影片现在成了珍贵的历史文献。苏联在二十年代开始生产故事片。“战舰波将金号”和“母亲”的摄制成功是苏联电影界的胜利，为苏联电影在社会主义现实主义基础上的发展开辟了道路。三十年代出现了有声电影，拍制了影片“夏伯阳”，这标志着电影中的社会主义现实主义创作方法的确立，是苏联电影发展的一个重要阶段。随后苏联又出现了像“马克辛三部曲”、“波罗的海代表”、“生路”等优秀影片。三十年代是苏联电影蓬勃发展的时期，这是因为国内政治生活高涨的缘故，那时正是实行国家工业化和农业集体化的时期。
    格拉西莫夫说，随着政治生活的发展，出现了影片“党证”、“伟大的公民”，出现了喜剧片“伏尔加—伏尔加”、“快乐的人们”以及各种主题和多种风格的新片。卫国战争期间，苏联拍摄了许多军事纪录片，战后摄制了表现国民经济恢复情形的影片。
    格拉西莫夫说，苏共第二十次代表大会以后，电影创作比任何时候都更加高涨。如果说卫国战争以后苏联曾经有过全年生产十部影片的情形，那么现在每年可以生产一百部左右新的艺术故事片了。这一时期涌现出许多有才能的新演员和优秀的电影工作者，他们将成为老一代的接班人。这一时期电影的特点是风格、题材、表现手法的多样化，影片表现了现代人的生活，像开垦处女地，各民族的友谊，保卫和平等。各加盟共和国的电影事业也有很大发展，大部分加盟共和国建立了制片厂，并且摄制了许多好影片。
    格拉西莫夫又说，现在，苏联电影工作者在为纪念十月革命四十周年而创作。献给十月革命节的影片约有几十部，如“两姊妹”、“暴风雨所诞生的”、“共产党人”、“关于列宁的故事”、“十月的日子”等。我所拍摄的“静静的顿河”已摄好两部，最后一部可在年底完成。
    这位名导演最后说，苏联人民在纪念十月革命节的时候，最容易想起亲密的朋友——中国。中苏两国人民是最亲近的。新中国成立后我在中国的访问，成了我一生中最幸福的回忆。他又说，中国电影比起刚建国时期有了飞跃的进步。中国电影无论在故事的情节，或是在人物性格的刻划方面都有了发展。我最近所看到的中国影片都是质量很高的影片。
