　　Xinhua News Agency, 23rd: The United States and Britain's plan to control other countries in the North Atlantic Group and drag them into future nuclear wars is deepening contradictions within the group.

    The proposals recently put forward by U.S. Secretary of State Dulles and Defense Secretary McElroy to establish U.S.-controlled atomic weapons storage and deployment of intermediate-range ballistic missiles in Western Europe have aroused strong suspicion and unease in Western European countries. The U.S. and Britain's plan to sacrifice the sovereignty of Western European countries to "merge" the military forces of the North Atlantic Group has also shocked Western European countries.

    France is particularly annoyed by the collusion between the United States and Britain behind its back. French Defense Minister Chaban-Delmas announced on the 22nd that France would never accept the ban imposed on it by its allies, which would allow the U.S. and Britain to monopolize the manufacture of nuclear weapons while prohibiting other Atlantic countries from manufacturing them. He called this reorganization plan "discriminatory."

    Some French diplomats have openly expressed concern that the actions of the United States and Britain in creating an "alliance within the alliance" in the North Atlantic Group have placed them in a position to control the group. The London "Times" believes that the "deeper reason" for France's current "excitement" lies not in the U.S.-British arms shipments to Tunisia, but in "fear of U.S.-British control (over the North Atlantic Group)."

    The Paris "Combat" also said: "The plot against North Africa is a step by the two major powers (the U.S. and Britain) to satellitize the thirteen countries (of the North Atlantic Group)."

    Some observers in Paris link the above-mentioned plan with the pressure France has recently received from the United States and the issue of supplying weapons to Tunisia. They believe that the supply of weapons to Tunisia is to tell France that its position in North Africa is insecure and to make France more obedient when it comes to further abandoning national sovereignty.

    West Germany is also uneasy about the US-British plan to control the North Atlantic Group. London diplomatic sources said that West German Foreign Minister Brentano's sudden decision to visit Washington was due to West Germany's fear of "being sidelined" when planning the North Atlantic Group summit. The West German newspaper "Neue Rheinische Zeitung" said that Brentano's trip was aimed at "preventing the Anglo-Americans from directing (Western European) continental countries."

    British public opinion also expressed unease about the U.S. and British policy of preparing for nuclear war. The Conservative "Daily Mail" expressed surprise and dissatisfaction with Dulles' announcement that the U.S. and Britain had reached an agreement in Bermuda to "store U.S.-controlled atomic weapons on British bases." The newspaper said that the policy implemented by the U.S. ruling group is a "terrible policy." It pointed out that the plan to store nuclear weapons in Western Europe under U.S. supervision was kept secret from the British people.

    The "News Chronicle" said that Dulles likes to brag about the power of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. However, although the North Atlantic Treaty Organization has been established for eight years, it is not a powerful alliance now. Many small countries are unwilling to be completely involved in it because they know it is just an American military machine.

    The London "Daily Worker" demanded that the government disclose the contents of the Bermuda agreement regarding missile issues. The newspaper said: "The British people do not want more atomic bases, they demand a summit of great powers to discuss and begin to resolve the major issues that threaten world peace."

### 美英控制大西洋集团计划吓煞了伙伴  法国特别恼火，西德当局和英国舆论也很不安

    美英控制大西洋集团计划吓煞了伙伴
    法国特别恼火，西德当局和英国舆论也很不安
    本报综合报道　据新华社23日讯：美国和英国企图控制北大西洋集团其他国家和把它们拖入未来的核战争的计划，正在加深这个集团内部的矛盾。
    美国国务卿杜勒斯和国防部长麦克艾罗伊最近提出的在西欧建立美国控制下的原子武器储存和配置中程弹道导弹的建议，在西欧各国引起了强烈的怀疑和不安。美国和英国打算牺牲西欧各国的主权来“合并”北大西洋集团的军事力量的计划也使得西欧国家感到震惊。
    法国对于美国和英国背着它所进行的勾结特别恼火。法国国防部长沙邦—戴尔马22日宣布，法国永远不会接受它的盟国强加于它的由美英垄断核武器制造而不准其他大西洋国家制造核武器的禁令。他把这种改组计划称为“歧视”。
    法国的一些外交家公开地表示担心美国和英国在北大西洋集团中制造“联盟内的联盟”的行动，已经使它们处于一种控制这个集团的地位。伦敦“泰晤士报”认为，法国目前的“激动”的“更深刻的原因”，不在于美英运送武器给突尼斯，而在于“害怕美英（对北大西洋集团）的控制”。
    巴黎“战斗报”也说：“针对北非的图谋是两大国（美、英）要把（北大西洋集团）十三个国家卫星化的一个步骤。”
    巴黎有些观察家把上述计划同法国在最近期间从美国方面所受到的压力和供应突尼斯武器问题联系起来。他们认为，供应突尼斯武器是为了告诉法国：它在北非的阵地是不牢靠的，并且使法国在问题涉及到进一步放弃民族主权的时候，变得更听话一些。
    西德对于美英企图控制北大西洋集团的计划也感到不安。伦敦外交界人士说，西德外交部长勃伦塔诺突然作出访问华盛顿的决定，是因为西德害怕在筹划北大西洋集团首脑会议的时候“被冷落”。西德报纸“新莱因报”说，勃伦塔诺此行的目的是“阻止英美指挥（西欧）大陆国家”。
    英国的舆论对于美英两国准备核战争的政策也表示不安。保守党的“每日邮报”对于杜勒斯宣布美英两国在百慕大达成“在英国基地上存放美国控制下的原子武器”的协议表示诧异和不满。这家报纸说，美国统治集团执行的政策是一种“可怕的政策”。它指出，在美国的监督下在西欧储存核武器的计划是瞒着英国人民的。
    “新闻纪事报”说，杜勒斯喜欢吹嘘北大西洋公约组织的威力。但是，北大西洋公约组织虽然成立了八年，现在这个组织并不是一个有力量的联盟。许多小国不愿意完全卷入其中，因为他们知道这不过是一架美国军事机器而已。
    伦敦“工人日报”要求政府公开百慕大协议关于导弹问题的决定的内容。报纸说：“英国人民不要更多的原子基地，他们要求举行大国首脑会议讨论和开始解决威胁着世界和平的主要问题。”
