Many Factories in Liaoning Thoroughly Rectify After Extensive Airing of Views; Mobilizing the Masses to Discuss Major Issues in Enterprises

(Our Dispatch) This reporter, Jin Yukun, comments on the current rectification movement in factories and mines in the Liaoning area: Most factories and mines in Liaoning have now undergone a general airing of views and have moved on to mobilizing the masses to discuss major issues in enterprises, starting a thorough rectification.

In the Liaoning area, the airing of views in enterprises began in mid-September for some, and mostly after National Day. According to statistics at the end of October, more than 1,000 factories and mines in the province, nearly 80% of the workforce—1.2 million people—participated in the airing of views, offering more than 4.3 million suggestions and posting more than 1.8 million big-character posters. The climax of airing views in industrial and mining enterprises in Liaoning developed very rapidly due to the promotion of the national situation and the surging socialist enthusiasm of the masses. For example, the Huanggu Tun Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory formed a massive airing of views climax throughout the factory in three days, posting more than 10,000 big-character posters in a few days (an average of more than three posters per person). In general enterprises, as long as the masses are fully mobilized, the airing of views will come to an end in about a week to ten days. In this stage, the main purpose is to let the masses speak their minds, asking them to say whatever they want and speak freely. According to a survey by the Shenyang Mining Machinery Factory, after the climax of the airing of views, the movement reached this level: 91% of the workers and 80% of the cadres spoke, and 65% of the entire factory spoke more than three times, expressing their true thoughts. The scope of the suggestions was very broad, ranging from specific issues in workshops, factories, to provinces, cities, and the State Council, from specific issues in production and welfare to policies in all aspects of domestic and foreign affairs.

Major Issues Need In-Depth Discussion

After the climax of the airing of views, most people expressed their true thoughts and generally felt that there were no more suggestions to be made. However, in reality, the airing of views had not been thorough enough. Even in factories and mines with better airing of views, such as the Shenyang Mining Machinery Factory, workers offered more than 20,000 suggestions (an average of 6.2 suggestions per person) and posted more than 10,000 big-character posters (an average of 2.6 posters per person), but still 20% of the workers did not speak or write. Many of those who had spoken their minds mostly offered general opinions, many specific and minor issues, and more exposure and criticism, with relatively few major and systematic constructive suggestions based on deep consideration. This is a natural phenomenon in general airing of views, because of the different division of labor and positions of the workers and leaders, they tend to raise issues from a personal perspective and consider the major issues in the entire enterprise relatively less. Although many major issues in enterprises were touched upon during the climax of airing of views, they were often raised very simply and not deeply enough. For example, they said: "I think our factory has an bloated structure and should be streamlined!" "There are too many idlers in our factory, why not streamline them?" What is the key to the problem and how should it be improved? It is also necessary to mobilize workers to conduct in-depth discussions. In summary, rectification based solely on the opinions in the airing of views will often be limited to solving some minor issues, and will not significantly change the face of the factory, thus failing to achieve the main purpose of rectification.

How can we attract the attention and interest of the masses to major issues in the enterprise and ensure a thorough rectification? The experience of Liaoning is: to organize the masses to discuss major issues in the rectification in a guided manner. Focusing on the major issues of the enterprise, especially the issues that the masses are very concerned about but were not aired deeply enough in the first stage, this discussion will fully and thoroughly expose the main contradictions in the enterprise and propose specific improvement methods.

How to Organize Discussions?

How should this discussion be organized? First of all, a noteworthy issue is: the time should not be too early or too late. Although general airing of views touches on fewer major issues, most of these opinions are related to the immediate interests of the workers, and they are all very important in the eyes of the workers. Therefore, if these opinions are ignored and the discussion of major issues in the rectification is started too early, it will limit the enthusiasm of the masses to air their views, prevent workers from speaking freely, and at the same time make this discussion lack a mass base. However, if the masses have mostly spoken their minds, and we still delay in leading the masses to discuss and find ways to solve the major issues in the enterprise, it will further affect the enthusiasm of the masses. Secondly, the topics for discussion should not only be major issues in the enterprise, but also issues that the masses are widely concerned about. The topics should be selected from the issues that the masses have already raised as much as possible (this is also possible). If the issues are only raised by the leaders, the interest and enthusiasm of the masses may be affected. Third, general issues should be resolved as much as possible before turning to this discussion. In addition, too many topics and prolonged discussion times are also inappropriate.

After entering the discussion of major issues, many factories in Shenyang immediately formed a new climax, and many major issues were raised, and the airing of views was deeper and more thorough. Workers in the Shenyang Mining Machinery Factory offered more than 56,000 suggestions, of which more than 31,000 were raised during the discussion of major issues.

Three Forms of Organizing Discussion

Based on the existing materials, there are roughly three forms of organizing the discussion of major issues:

The first form can be exemplified by the Shenyang Mining Machinery Factory. After summarizing the major issues raised in the airing of views, the leadership of this factory proposed three topics. This transformation is more natural and easier for the masses to accept. When proposing the topics, the leadership does not propose reform plans first. Only after the masses discuss the topics does the leadership propose preliminary reform plans based on the opinions of the masses, and then submit them to the masses for repeated discussions, finally determining an advanced and feasible reform plan.

The second form can be exemplified by the Huanggu Tun Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory. Their approach is: first, the leadership organizes forces to conduct in-depth investigations and research (while absorbing the opinions of the masses in the airing of views), proposes preliminary plans, and then mobilizes the masses to conduct special discussions, further supplementing and revising the plans proposed by the leadership through discussions. The characteristic of this form is the combination of leadership's investigation and research and mass discussion, which is particularly suitable for solving some more complex problems. For example, one of the topics of this factory is the issue of reducing costs. To solve this problem well, it is not enough to rely solely on the discussion of the factory's workers; it is necessary to conduct investigations and research in similar advanced factories to find solutions. Therefore, they specially organized an investigation team to study in two advanced factories, Harbin and Mudanjiang. After returning to the factory, they also inspected the factory's production and found that the high cost was mainly due to excessive waste. Based on these investigations and research, they proposed 194 improvement measures and formulated a plan to reduce costs by more than 30%. Around this plan, all the factory's workers conducted special discussions. During the discussion, the masses also proposed many specific ways to reduce costs, with the locomotive main assembly workshop alone proposing 300 measures. After extensive discussion by all the factory's workers, a plan on paper became a feasible plan with a mass base. In the past four and a half years, this factory has only reduced costs by 9% to 16%. After this special discussion, the factory, from top to bottom, has a great deal of confidence and is prepared to reduce costs by more than 30% in one quarter and catch up with the national advanced level.

The third form is to organize professional personnel to conduct special discussions. The Huanggu Tun Freight Car Repair Factory held 16 special discussion meetings separately according to seven systems such as planning, scheduling, accounting, labor wages, etc. The Shenyang Mining Machinery Factory organized people who are concerned about the issue to participate in the discussion after determining the topic. They held a forum for workshop directors, planning, statistics and other personnel. These professional personnel are usually scattered in various units. When airing their views on their own business, they often feel that they are "clapping with one hand." When airing their views in their own workshops, they are often afraid that the opinions will not be conveyed to the relevant units, or that the communication will not be comprehensive. They are also afraid of not being able to explain clearly when writing big-character posters. Now, they gather together to hold meetings, inspire and supplement each other. People who originally did not speak also actively speak at the meeting, and the issues are discussed more deeply.

Rectification Climax and Production Climax

Organizing the masses to discuss major issues in the rectification is a form of taking the mass line during the key rectification stage. After this discussion is launched, a situation focusing on rectification will naturally be formed in the enterprise. The general situation is: first, many people tend to agree with one aspect of the opinion, and after a period of time, there will be a collision of different opinions, and then a debate will unfold. After repeated debates, ideological and organizational preparations will be made for rectification. Many factories are discussing and bearing fruit at the same time. Part of the cost reduction plan of the Huanggu Tun Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory has now been realized. The loss of dismantling a car has been reduced by 200 yuan compared to before. The amount of paint used for painting the outer skin of passenger cars has been reduced from 90 kg to 35 kg while ensuring quality. The Huanggu Tun Freight Car Repair Factory proposed a production reform plan to promote assembly line operations and increase labor productivity by 27% in the special discussion. The first step of this plan has now begun to be implemented. Many factories are organizing the high enthusiasm of the masses into a production climax through competition. Based on the favorable factors such as institutional reform and revision of quotas, the Shenyang Screw Factory has formulated a plan to increase production and save another 1.02 million yuan in the fourth quarter. The Shenyang Mining Machinery Factory has also decided to increase production by another 3.2 million yuan and save more than 1 million yuan in addition to the original production increase and savings plan. Organizing the masses to discuss major issues in the rectification will inevitably push the movement to a rectification climax and a production climax.

The experience of rectification in industrial and mining enterprises in Liaoning proves that: all major tasks in enterprises, whether economic, technical, or management issues, can only be considered most carefully, and things can only be done most thoroughly, and the resistance encountered can only be reduced to the minimum extent after extensive airing of views, debates, and repeated discussions by the masses, and mobilizing the high enthusiasm of the masses. Therefore, this method of organizing the masses to discuss major issues in enterprises can not only be used in the current rectification, but also can be used frequently in the future work of enterprises, so that the leadership's investigation and research and the infinite wisdom of the masses can be better combined.

    辽宁许多工厂在大鸣大放后彻底整改
    发动群众讨论企业中的重大问题
    本报讯　记者金雨困评述目前辽宁地区厂矿企业的整风运动：辽宁地区大多数厂矿企业现在都经过普遍的大鸣大放，转入发动群众讨论企业中的重大问题，着手进行彻底的整改。
    辽宁地区企业的大鸣大放，有一部分开始于9月中旬，大部分是在国庆节后展开的。据10月底统计，全省已经有一千多个厂矿企业、近80％的职工——一百二十万人参加了大鸣大放，共提出四百三十多万条意见，贴出一百八十多万张大字报。辽宁地区工矿企业的鸣放高潮，由于全国形势的推动，群众社会主义积极性的高涨，发展十分迅速。例如，皇姑屯机车客车修理工厂在三天内就形成了全厂声势浩大的鸣放高潮，几天内贴出的大字报超过万张以上（平均每人三张多）。在一般企业，只要群众发动得充分，有一周到十天左右的时间，鸣放就告一段落。在这一阶段，主要目的是让群众把心里的话说出来，要求有啥说啥，畅所欲言。据沈阳矿山机器厂调查，经过大鸣大放高潮，运动就达到了这样的程度：91％的工人、80％的干部都发了言，全厂65％的人发言三次以上，说出了心里话；提意见的范围很广，从工段、车间、工厂到省、市、国务院，从生产福利工作中的具体问题一直到国家内政外交各方面的政策。
    重大问题需要深入讨论
    在大鸣大放的高潮以后，大部分人都说出了心里话，一般都认为没有什么意见可说了。但是实际上还没有鸣深放透。即使鸣放较好的厂矿，如沈阳矿山机器厂，职工们提出意见二万多条（平均每人六点二条），贴出大字报一万多张（平均每人二点六张），但是仍然有20％的职工没有开口、动笔。已经说了心里话的人，许多也是提的一般性意见多，具体细小的问题多，揭发批评意见比较多，经过深思熟虑提出的比较重大和系统的建设性意见比较少。这是一般鸣放中的一种必然现象，原因是职工群众和领导者的分工不同、所处的地位不同，往往容易从个人角度提问题，而对整个企业中的重大问题考虑比较少。在鸣放高潮中，虽也触及到不少企业中的重大问题，但是往往提得很简单而且不够深刻。如说：“我认为我们厂机构臃肿，应当紧缩！”“我们厂吃闲饭的人太多了，为啥不精简？”究竟问题的关键在哪里，应该如何改进？还需要发动职工进行深入的讨论。总起来说，只是根据大鸣大放中的意见来进行整改，往往会只限于解决一些细枝末节的问题，不能使工厂面貌发生重大的改变，因而也就不能达到整风的主要目的。
    怎样才能把群众的注意力和兴趣吸引到企业中的重大问题上来，保证整改得彻底呢？辽宁的经验是：有领导地组织群众讨论整改中的重大问题。围绕本企业的重大问题，特别是为群众十分关心而在第一阶段鸣放得不深不透的问题，通过这种讨论使企业中的主要矛盾得到充分彻底的暴露，并且提出具体的改进办法。
    怎样组织讨论？
    应该怎样组织这种讨论呢？首先一个值得注意的问题是：时间不宜过早，也不宜过迟。一般大鸣大放虽然触及的重大问题较少，但是这些意见大部分同职工切身的利益有关，在职工个人看来都是很重要的问题。因此，如果忽视这些意见，过早地转入讨论整改中的重大问题，就会限制群众鸣放的积极性，使职工不能畅所欲言，同时使这种讨论缺乏群众基础。但是当群众大部分已经畅所欲言以后，如果仍旧迟迟不领导群众讨论和设法解决企业中的重大问题，那就更会影响群众的积极性。其次，讨论的专题，既要选择企业中的重大问题，又要考虑到是群众广泛关心的问题。专题应该尽量从群众已经提出的问题中选择（这也是可能的），如果仅仅由领导上提出问题，群众的兴趣和积极性可能会受到影响。第三，在转入这种讨论以前，一般问题应该尽可能地先解决掉。此外，专题过多和这种讨论的时间拖得过长也是不适宜的。
    沈阳许多工厂由大鸣大放进入讨论重大问题以后，马上就形成了一个新的高潮，许多重大问题都提出来了，而且鸣放得又深又透。沈阳矿山机器厂职工共提出五万六千多条意见，其中有三万一千多条是在讨论重大问题时提出的。
    组织讨论的三种形式
    就现有材料来看，组织讨论重大问题的方法大致有三种形式：
    第一种形式可以拿沈阳矿山机器厂为例。这个厂的领导方面把大鸣大放中提出的重大问题归纳以后提出了三个专题。这样的转变较为自然，群众也易于接受。在提出专题的时候，领导方面先不提出改革方案，等群众围绕专题讨论起来以后，领导方面才根据群众意见提出初步的改革方案，再交群众进行反复的讨论，最后确定一个先进可行的改革方案。
    第二种形式可以拿皇姑屯机车客车修理工厂为例。他们的作法是：先由领导方面组织力量作深入的调查研究（同时吸收群众鸣放中的意见），提出初步方案，再发动群众进行专题讨论，通过讨论进一步补充和修正领导方面提出的方案。这种形式的特点是领导方面的调查研究和群众的讨论相结合，特别适宜于用来解决一些比较复杂的问题。例如，这个厂的专题之一是降低成本问题。要很好地解决这个问题，仅仅依靠本厂职工讨论是不够的，需要到同类先进厂去作调查研究，寻找办法。因此，他们专门组织了一个调查组，到哈尔滨和牡丹江两个先进工厂去学习。回厂以后又对本厂生产进行了检查，发现成本高主要是因为浪费太大。根据这些调查研究，他们提出了一百九十四条改进措施，制订了降低成本30％以上的方案。围绕这个方案，全厂职工进行了专题讨论。在讨论中，群众又提出了很多降低成本的具体办法，仅机车主装车间就提出了三百条措施。这样经过全厂职工广泛的讨论，一个纸上的方案就变成为有群众基础切实可行的方案了。这个厂在过去四年半的时间内仅降低成本9％到16％，经过这次专题讨论以后，这个厂从上到下已经具有十分的把握和信心，准备在一个季度内降低成本30％以上，赶上全国的先进水平。
    第三种形式是组织专业人员进行专题讨论。皇姑屯货车修理工厂按计划、调度、会计、劳动工资等七个系统，分别举行了十六次专题讨论会。沈阳矿山机器厂是在确定专题以后，组织关心这个问题的人员参加讨论。他们召开了工段长、计划、统计等人员的座谈会。这些专业人员平时分散在各个单位，在鸣放本行业务时往往感到“孤掌难鸣”，在本车间鸣放的时候，往往怕意见传达不到有关单位，或者传达不全面，写大字报又怕说不清楚；现在聚集在一起开会，互相启发，互相补充，原来不开口的人也在会上积极发言，问题也讨论得比较深透。
    整改高潮和生产高潮
    组织群众讨论整改中的重大问题，是着重整改阶段走群众路线的一种形式。这种讨论开展以后，企业中就自然地形成了着重整改的局面。一般的情况是：先是不少人倾向于一个方面的意见，经过一段时间，就会出现不同意见的交锋，然后展开争论；经过反复的争论，就为整改作好了思想上和组织上的准备。许多工厂一面讨论，一面就在开花结果。皇姑屯机车客车修理工厂降低成本的方案，现在一部分已经实现。一台车的拆车损失已经比以前减少二百元，客车外皮喷漆时用漆数量已经在保证质量的情况下，由九十公斤降低到三十五公斤。皇姑屯货车修理厂在专题讨论中提出推行流水作业、提高劳动生产率27％的生产改革方案，现在这个方案的第一步已经开始实行。不少工厂正在把群众高涨的积极性，通过竞赛组织到生产高潮中去。沈阳螺钉厂在改革机构、修订定额等有利因素的基础上，制订了在第四季度再增产节约一百零二万元的计划。沈阳矿山机器厂也决定在原订增产节约计划以外再增产三百二十万元，节约百余万元。组织群众讨论整改中的重大问题，必然会把运动推向整改高潮和生产高潮。
    辽宁工矿企业整风的经验证明：企业中一切重大工作，无论是经济上、技术上或者是管理上的问题，只有经过群众的大鸣、大放、大争，反复研讨，调动起群众高涨的积极性，问题才能考虑得最周到，事情才能办得最彻底，遇到的阻力才能减低到最小的程度。因此，组织群众讨论企业中的重大问题这种方式，不仅可以在当前的整改中运用，而且在企业今后的工作中也可以经常运用，使领导上的调查研究和群众的无限智慧更好地结合起来。
