Xinhua News Agency, November 3rd: As the core of the Five-Year Plan construction, and the "156" industrial projects with comprehensive Soviet assistance to China's construction, as of the third quarter, according to the National Bureau of Statistics, 57 have been fully or partially completed and put into production. Among them, 37 have been fully completed and put into production. It is estimated that by the end of this year, the plan to fully complete 45 projects originally scheduled during the First Five-Year Plan can be successfully completed.

Of the "156" projects, 131 will have commenced construction by the end of this year, and 61 will have been fully or partially completed and put into production.

For these projects, the Soviet Union has provided comprehensive assistance from start to finish, from selecting factory sites, collecting basic design data, determining design task books, designing, supplying equipment, guiding construction and installation and commissioning operations, to the manufacture of new products. The Soviet people have put in a huge amount of work for the "156" projects with comprehensive assistance. In terms of design drawings alone, about 600,000 kilograms have been handed over to our country during the Five-Year Plan period. For the design of just one factory in the Northeast, 16 Soviet design institutes participated directly in the work. In these "156" industrial projects, all equipment that we are able to manufacture ourselves is made by our own country. Every year, representatives from China and the Soviet Union hold a distribution and handover meeting in this regard. Every year at the distribution and handover meeting, our country withdraws many pieces of equipment to make them ourselves. However, the equipment that needs to be supplied by the Soviet Union still accounts for more than half in terms of value before this year. These equipments are either not yet produced in our country, or although they can be produced, the quantity is insufficient. Many of them are precision, large-scale, or in line with the latest technical requirements. The complete sets of equipment already delivered by the Soviet Union (including individual non-industrial projects) are worth about 3 billion yuan in RMB, weighing about 700,000 tons. If transported by train, it would take more than 1,000 trains with 20 carriages each to load. In 1955 alone, for the 63 equipment distribution projects, the mechanical equipment that the Soviet Union agreed to help us manufacture amounted to 6,000 types and 40,000 units. The number of equipment distribution projects in 1956 reached 87, and the number of equipment distribution projects in 1957 reached 90, and the quantity that requires the Soviet Union to help us manufacture is even larger than this.

The 61 Soviet-assisted industrial enterprises that have been fully and partially put into production during the First Five-Year Plan have played a huge role in China's completion and over-completion of the Five-Year Plan. For example, of the 5 million tons of steel that may be reached by the end of this year, 2.8 million tons are produced by Soviet-assisted steel enterprises. Of the 120 million tons of coal that may be reached by the end of this year, 6.3 million tons are produced by Soviet-assisted coal mines. Of the more than 4.4 million kilowatts of power capacity equipment that may be reached by the end of this year, more than 680,000 kilowatts belong to Soviet-assisted power plants.

The 61 Soviet-assisted enterprises that have been partially or fully put into production during the First Five-Year Plan have also played a huge role in improving China's industrial production level. The fact that China has been able to manufacture airplanes, automobiles, coastal ships, and more than 200 different types of machine tools is a good illustration.

### 苏联全面援助开花结果  五十七项重点工程全部或部分投入生产

    苏联全面援助开花结果
    五十七项重点工程全部或部分投入生产
    据新华社3日讯　作为五年计划建设中心的、苏联全面援助我国建设的“一五六”项工业工程，截至第三季度为止，据国家统计局统计，已经有五十七个全部或部分建成投入生产。其中已经全部建成投入生产的是三十七个。预计到今年年底，原定在第一个五年计划期间全部建成四十五个的计划，可以胜利完成。
    在“一五六”项工程中，到今年年底，开工兴建的将达一百三十一个，全部或部分建成投入生产的将达六十一个。
    这些工程，从选择厂址，搜集设计基础资料，确定设计任务书，设计，供应设备，指导建筑安装和开工运转，一直到新产品制造，苏联都给予从头到尾的全面援助。对于全面援助的“一五六”项工程，苏联人民付出了巨量的劳动。只是设计图纸，在五年计划期间已经交给我国的就达六十万公斤左右。只是给东北的一个工厂设计，苏联就有十六个设计院直接参加工作。在这“一五六”个工业项目中，凡是我们已经能够自行制造的设备，就由我国自己来作。每年中苏两国在这方面的代表都有一次分交会谈，每年在分交会谈中，我国都把许多设备撤回来自己作。但是需要苏联供应的设备，按价值计算，在今年以前，仍占一半以上。这些设备都是目前我国还不能生产的或虽能生产数量不足的。其中许多是精密的或大型的或合乎最新技术要求的产品。苏联已经交付的成套设备（包括个别非工业项目在内）约值人民币三十亿元，重量约七十多万吨。如果用火车来装运，需要挂二十个车皮的一千多列车才能装下。只是1955年设备分交的六十三个项目，协议由苏联帮我国制造的机械设备，就达六千种，四万台件。而1956年设备分交的项目达八十七个，1957年设备分交的项目达九十个，要求苏联帮我们制造的数量都比这个还要大。
    在第一个五年计划期间全部和部分投入生产的六十一个苏联全面援助的工业企业，对于我国完成和超额完成五年计划起了巨大的作用。如在今年底可能达到的五百万吨钢的产量中，就有二百八十万吨是产于苏联全面援助的钢铁企业。到今年年底可能达到的一点二亿吨煤的产量中，就有六百三十万吨产于苏联全面援助的煤矿。到今年年底可能达到的四百四十多万瓩的电力容量设备中，就有六十八万多瓩属于苏联全面援助的电厂。
    在第一个五年计划期间部分或全部投入生产的六十一个苏联全面援助的企业，对于提高我国工业生产水平也起了巨大作用。我国已能制造飞机、汽车、近海轮船和二百多种不同型号的机床，就是很好的说明。
