    News Headlines Should Be More Accessible
    I think that the headlines of some news items in the People's Daily are sometimes not very accessible. For example, on page 5 of the October 23rd issue, there was a headline like this: "Syria's Purchase of Soviet Weapons, What's it to You?" After reading the content of this news, I understood the meaning, but I didn't understand the explanation of "What's it to You?". I asked several comrades, and they also said they didn't understand. The education level of the readers of the People's Daily varies, and I hope that the news headlines can be made as accessible as possible.

    新闻标题要更通俗些
    我觉得人民日报有时个别新闻的标题很不通俗。如10月23日第五版上有这样一个标题：“叙利亚买苏联武器干卿底事”。看了这则新闻的内容，意思是知道了，但“干卿底事”作何解释，不懂。我问了几个同志，他们亦说不懂。人民日报读者的文化程度是高低不一的，希望尽可能把新闻标题作得通俗一些。　　　　　　　　　白芸秋
