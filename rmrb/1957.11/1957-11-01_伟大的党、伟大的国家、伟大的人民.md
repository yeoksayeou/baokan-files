    Great Party, Great Nation, Great People
    Zhou Peiyuan, Vice President of Peking University
    The October Revolution is now forty years old. Forty years is less than 1% of the five or six thousand years of human cultural history. However, the salvo of the October Revolution shattered the chains that imperialism had placed on the people of the world; the spark from the cruiser Aurora forty years ago has gradually burned away the poisonous weeds from more than one-third of the earth's surface, allowing more than one-third of the world's people to joyfully build their socialist paradise. The October Revolution pointed out the historical path forward for mankind and allowed us to foresee a bright future. All peace-loving working people around the world greet the fortieth anniversary of the great October Revolution with unparalleled joy and excitement.
    The founding of the People's Republic of China eight years ago was a continuation of the October Revolution. Most of our bourgeois intellectuals also only had the opportunity to have direct contact with Soviet scientists after the Chinese people's revolutionary and liberation cause achieved brilliant victory, to learn about the glorious achievements of the Soviet Union in science, thereby deeply understanding the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system, and recognizing that the October Revolution truly liberated the power and wisdom of the people. The October Revolution was the beginning of the people's century.
    Since our country's liberation, the Soviet government and people have sent thousands upon thousands of their excellent sons and daughters to our country to teach us and help us build socialism. After leaving their homeland and coming to our country, they worked selflessly for us. In the past five years, Peking University has successively hired more than twenty Soviet experts to guide us in learning from the Soviet Union's advanced experience, carry out teaching reforms, cultivate new forces, and establish scientific research bases. Their work enthusiasm and high degree of responsibility fully demonstrated the excellent qualities of the people of socialist countries. I recall Professor Novodranov, the president's advisor and colloid chemistry expert, and Comrade Belova, the aerodynamics expert, with whom I had more contact in my work. At the opening ceremony of the teaching experience exchange conference held at Peking University in the winter of 1954, Professor Novodranov insisted on giving his long academic report despite suffering from a severe cold, which greatly moved the teachers and students present. While diligently doing her teaching and training graduate students and young assistant lecturers, Comrade Belova also compiled and published a textbook on gas dynamics. However, she resolutely refused the remuneration she deserved for her labor. She believed that the Chinese government had already paid her a monthly salary and that she should not receive additional income from our publishing house. Her humble, thrifty, serious work attitude and personal style are truly worlds apart from the so-called scholars among bourgeois intellectuals who crave fame, fortune, and the pursuit of status.
    Similarly, Soviet friends also received Chinese guests visiting the Soviet Union with unparalleled warm affection. I visited Leningrad in 1955. At that time, Professor Van Lander, Vice President of Leningrad University and Director of the Aerodynamics Teaching and Research Department, personally hosted my visit to the aerodynamics laboratory of the Department of Mathematics and Mechanics, the gas dynamics laboratory, the Department of Physics and the Institute of Physics, the cyclotron, and invited me to participate in the graduation thesis defense of university graduates, the thesis defense of doctoral students, and the competition conference for the appointment of associate professors, etc. He was able to satisfy all my requests. He could accompany me from ten in the morning until eleven at night without rest or food. Here, I also thought of the President of the Sverdlovsk Institute of Technology. When Comrade Jiang Nanxiang, President of Tsinghua University, and I went to visit there in 1955, he was with us all the time during the three or four days from the time we arrived until we left Sverdlovsk, visiting, touring, and sightseeing. His patience, enthusiasm, and friendly internationalist spirit are examples for us to learn from.
    The Soviet people made unprecedented great contributions in defeating German fascism and Japanese militarism, and paid a huge price. We can see the merits of many experts in our school in the Patriotic War. Some of them lost an arm in the war, some lost a leg; others received medals and awards. However, they were always so humble and reserved about their sacrifices for the people; when you got along with them, they rarely talked about their past. The heroic people of Leningrad lived a hard life that is difficult to describe in words during the days when they were surrounded by German fascists. They struggled on the line of death and hunger every day, but our experts from Leningrad never talked about these things, never boasted about their suffering past. Professor Van Lander of Leningrad University was a navigator in the Air Force during the Patriotic War. In the war to defend Leningrad, young people volunteered to go to the front to fight. The Geometry Teaching and Research Department led by Academician Alexandrov, President of Leningrad University, had more than twenty teachers and graduate students before the war, but after the war only Professor Alexandrov was left. The other members either sacrificed in the battle to defend Leningrad or died of malnutrition. Academician Alexandrov himself also requested to join the defense war, but was not approved by the higher authorities due to his lofty academic status in the country. Such heroic deeds of loving the motherland and being prepared to sacrifice one's life at any time to fight for the defense of the socialist cause can be heard everywhere in the Soviet Union.
    Traveling and visiting the Soviet Union, I almost always saw new people and new things worth learning from. Once, when I was traveling on an electric train in the suburbs of Moscow with a Chinese student, I only saw passengers buying tickets before boarding, but I did not see any ticket collectors, ticket checkers, or ticket takers. It is said that electric trains in the suburbs of Moscow run many times every day, but very few people check tickets on the train, and even if someone checks tickets, it is rare to find cases of people riding without buying tickets. After forty years of socialist ideological education, the Soviet people have made abiding by social order and cherishing public property their own conscious rules of action.
    Soviet scientific research institutions and universities also assist our research institutions and universities with the same brotherly spirit of friendship. The Soviet Academy of Sciences and our Academy of Sciences have close ties. Our Peking University President Ma Yinchu wrote to the President of Moscow University requesting assistance in establishing our mechanics laboratory. They immediately agreed to draw up the general plan of the laboratory and write the instructions in three or four months, and solemnly hand it over to us at a meeting during the celebration of the 200th anniversary of the founding of Moscow University. This strong support for academic institutions in fraternal countries is a good example for us. Especially because we lack scientific talent and have weak technical strength, our scientific undertakings must be greatly strengthened in the future. We must rely more on Soviet scientific institutions and schools to strive for their assistance; at the same time, we must also support and learn from each other in order to achieve the rapid development of our country's scientific undertakings and meet the needs of socialist construction.
    Peace-loving people all over the world clearly recognize the Soviet government's world peace policy and the spirit of internationalism in handling international affairs in the socialist camp. In 1955, when I participated in the celebration of the 200th anniversary of Moscow University, the translator asked me to visit the German art exhibition. At that time, I had many institutions and schools to visit, and I didn't really want to go, always thinking that I could put off seeing the art exhibition (although I am generally very happy to see art). But when I arrived in front of the exhibition hall, I was surprised to see a sea of people. After entering the exhibition hall, the German art exhibition immediately gave me a very profound internationalist education. It turned out that this batch of oil paintings were exhibits from the Dresden Art Gallery in Germany before the war. When German fascism collapsed, the Soviet Red Army discovered this large batch of oil paintings in a damp salt mine, many of which were world-famous paintings that had been damaged. After the Soviet Red Army discovered these precious works of art, they transported them to the Soviet Union. After being repaired and preserved by Soviet artists, and after being restored in the Dresden Art Gallery in Germany, the Soviet government made a decision to return them to the government and people of Democratic Germany. Before sending them back to Democratic Germany, the Soviet government decided to hold an exhibition in Moscow for three months. No wonder the Soviet people were eager to appreciate these artistic treasures of the German people. My visit to this exhibition had a very profound impact on me. Because when I was a student in Germany in 1929, I had visited the Dresden Art Gallery, where the most famous oil painting was Raphael's Sistine Madonna, a masterpiece of the Italian Renaissance. When I entered the gate of the Moscow German Art Exhibition and saw this work, I felt very親切, very moved: 親切 because this famous painting that I had seen in my youth still existed after the fascist war and the indiscriminate bombing by American planes (when the heroic Red Army was about to liberate Dresden, American planes destroyed this world-famous city in one night); I was moved by the Soviet government's incomparably great spirit of internationalism. I also thought of the unforgivable crimes of imperialism by the US, Britain, France, Japan, and other countries in plundering our cultural relics. American imperialism stole two of the eight horses of Zhao Mausoleum and dismantled the Lama Temple in Jehol; British and French imperialism stole the cultural relics of Dunhuang. Who are our friends and who are our enemies, the right-wing elements in the cultural and artistic circles can now see clearly.
    Under the leadership of the great, glorious, and correct Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Soviet people have transformed a backward agricultural country into an advanced industrial country in just forty years. In just forty years, the Soviet people defeated imperialist intervention, suppressed the domestic White Army rebellion, extinguished the Trotskyite conspiracy, defeated the ferocious fascist enemy, and defeated the so-called most elite Kwantung Army of Japan. In the short ten years from the 30th to the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution, outstanding Soviet scientific and technical personnel mastered atomic energy and invented the world's first atomic power station, and built the world's largest 10 billion electron volt synchrophasotron; the Soviet aviation industry is the most advanced aviation industry in the world, and the Soviet jet civil aircraft is the most perfect means of civil aviation transportation in the world. When the Soviet government announced that it had launched an intercontinental ballistic missile, the imperialist camp headed by US imperialism was still skeptical. But after the Soviet Union launched the first artificial satellite, the imperialist camp, especially its leader US imperialism, showed panic and dismay. Seeing and hearing the facts of the artificial satellite, they had to face the fact that the Soviet Union is also a giant in science and technology. In the past short ten years, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union has not only led the Soviet people to achieve the highest growth rate of productivity in industrial and agricultural production, but has also surpassed the most advanced capitalist countries in major aspects of science and technology. At the same time, they also helped our country restore the national economy, build industry and agriculture, assist in teaching reform, and carry out scientific research. Excellent Soviet engineering and technical personnel helped us build highways to the roof of the world, build large reservoirs, manufacture locomotives, ships, and airplanes, and build the first bridge over the Yangtze River, making the natural barrier accessible from now on. In our future socialist construction work, we must also carry out our scientific research work on a large scale, to realize the twelve-year scientific and technological perspective plan that we formulated last year, and to catch up with the advanced level of the world in twelve years. For this reason, we must rely more on Soviet assistance in science and technology, and the Soviet Union will certainly give us selfless assistance.
    The historical development since the October Revolution fully illustrates the fact that because the Chinese people, under the leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party, took the road of the October Revolution, the Chinese people's liberation cause and socialist construction have achieved brilliant historical victories. We have also seen that the development of Chinese science and technology has followed the Soviet socialist road in the past eight years and has achieved great achievements, and will certainly achieve even more brilliant achievements in the future. On the occasion of the glorious 40th anniversary of the October Revolution, we Chinese scientific workers and the Chinese people, together with peace-loving people all over the world, greet this great, historic festival with a grateful and joyful mood. We also sincerely congratulate the Soviet people for achieving even more brilliant achievements in the cause of building communism under the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government, and making the close unity between China and the Soviet Union more consolidated and stronger. Let us shout:
    Long live the great Communist Party of the Soviet Union!
    Long live the great Soviet government!
    Long live the great Soviet people!

    伟大的党、伟大的国家、伟大的人民
    北京大学副校长　周培源
    十月革命已有四十年了。四十年在人类五、六千年的文化历史上，还不到1％的时间。可是十月革命的一炮，摧断了帝国主义加在世界人民身上的锁链；四十年前阿芙乐尔巡洋舰上的星星之火，已逐步地烧尽了地球面积三分之一以上的毒草，使全世界三分之一以上的人民愉快地建设他们社会主义的乐园。十月革命为人类指出前进的历史道路，使我们预见到美好的未来。全世界爱好和平的劳动人民以无比欢欣鼓舞的心情来迎接伟大的十月革命节的四十周年。
    八年前，中华人民共和国的成立，是十月革命的继续。我们绝大部分资产阶级的知识分子也只有在中国人民革命解放事业取得辉煌胜利之后，才有机会与苏联的科学家们有了直接的接触，才有可能学习苏联在科学上的光辉成就，从而深刻地体会到社会主义制度的无比优越性，并认识到十月革命才把人民的力量与智慧真正地解放出来。十月革命是人民世纪的开始。
    自我国解放之后，苏联政府和人民派遣了他们上千成万的优秀的儿女来我国教导我们、帮助我们建设社会主义。他们远离祖国来到我国后忘我地为我们工作。在过去的五年时间里，我们北京大学曾先后聘请过二十多位苏联专家指导我们学习苏联先进经验，进行教学改革，培养新生力量和建立科学研究基地。他们工作的积极性和对事业的高度负责精神充分表现了社会主义国家人民的优良品德。我回忆到和我在工作上接触比较多的校长顾问、胶体化学专家诺沃德拉诺夫教授和空气动力学专家别洛娃同志。在1954年冬天北京大学举行教学经验交流会的开幕式上，诺沃德拉诺夫教授不顾自己患有重感冒而坚持要做他的长篇的学术报告，使到会的师生们十分感动。别洛娃同志在辛勤地做她的教学与培养研究生及青年讲助工作的同时，复编写了一本气体动力学讲义出版。但是她坚决地推却她的劳动所应得的报酬。她认为我国政府已按月付给她工资，不应再从我们的出版社获得额外的收入。她那种谦虚、俭朴、严肃的工作态度与个人作风，和资产阶级知识分子的好名、好利与追求地位的所谓学者真有天渊之别。
    同样的，苏联友人也以无比友爱的热情来接待从中国到苏联访问的中国客人。1955年我访问过列宁格勒城。当时列宁格勒大学副校长兼空气动力学教研室主任范兰德教授亲自招待我参观数学力学系的空气动力学实验室、气体力学实验室、物理系与物理研究所、回旋加速器，邀请我参加大学毕业生的毕业论文答辩、博士生的论文答辩以及副教授聘请的竞赛会议等等。凡是我所提出的要求，他都能使我得到满足。他可以从早晨十一点一直陪我到晚上十一点而不休息、不吃饭。在这里我也想到了斯维德洛夫斯克工业学院的院长。在1955年清华大学校长蒋南翔同志和我去该地访问的时候，从我们抵达的时间起一直到离开斯维德洛夫斯克止，在这三、四天内他一直和我们在一起参观、访问和游览。他那种耐心、热诚、友爱的国际主义精神是我们学习的榜样。
    苏联人民在打败德国法西斯与日本军国主义中作出了史无前例的伟大贡献，并付出了巨大的代价。在我们学校里许多位专家的身上就可以看出他们在卫国战争中的功勋。他们在战争中有丧失了一只胳臂的，有丧失了一条大腿的；也有人得到勋章与奖章。但是他们对于自己为人民作出的牺牲，总是那末谦虚，那末含蓄；和他们相处，他们很少谈他们的过去。英雄的列宁格勒人民在被德国法西斯包围的日子里，过着难以用笔墨来形容的艰苦生活，他们天天在死亡、饥饿线上挣扎，但是我们从列宁格勒来的专家们从来不谈这一些，从来不夸耀他们吃苦的过去。列宁格勒大学的范兰德教授在卫国战争中是空军中的领航员。在保卫列宁格勒的战争中，青年们都自愿报名上前线参加战斗。列宁格勒大学校长亚力山德洛夫通讯院士所领导的几何教研室，在战前共有教师和研究生二十多人，在战后只剩下亚力山德洛夫教授一人，其他各位成员不是在保卫列宁格勒战中牺牲，就是由于营养不良而病死。亚力山德洛夫通讯院士自己也曾要求报名参加保卫战，但由于他在国内的崇高的学术地位而未被上级批准。这种热爱祖国、准备随时牺牲自己的生命为保卫社会主义事业战斗的英雄事迹，在苏联到处都可以听到。
    在苏联旅行和访问，几乎经常看到新人物与新事物值得我们学习。一次和一位中国留学生乘莫斯科近郊的电火车时，我只见到旅客上车前购买车票，但未见到剪票、查票与收票人。据悉莫斯科近郊的电火车天天要开行很多次，但在车上很少有人查票，而即使有人查票也很少发现不购票乘车的事例。经过四十年的社会主义思想教育，苏联人民已把遵守社会秩序、爱护公共财物，作为自己自觉的行动规律。
    苏联的科学研究机关和高等学校，也以同样兄弟般的友爱精神来协助我们的研究机关与高等学校。苏联的科学院和我们的科学院有密切的联系。我们北京大学马寅初校长曾为建立我们的力学实验室写信给莫斯科大学校长恳请协助。他们立刻答应在三、四个月的时间内就画出实验室的总图和写出说明书，并在庆祝莫斯科大学成立二百周年的期间在一个会议上隆重地交给我们。这种对兄弟国家学术机关的大力支援是我们良好的榜样。特别是由于我们的科学人材缺乏，技术力量薄弱，今后的科学事业要大大地加强，我们要更多地依靠苏联的科学机关与学校，争取他们的援助；而同时我们自己也要彼此相互支援，相互学习，以求我国科学事业的迅速发展，适应社会主义建设的需要。
    全世界爱好和平的人民都清楚地认识到苏联政府的世界和平政策以及在处理社会主义阵营里国际事务中的国际主义精神。1955年在参加莫斯科大学二百周年庆祝会的时候，翻译同志要我去参观德国画展。我当时要访问的机关、学校很多，心里很不想去，总以为看画展可以搁一搁（虽然我一般很高兴看画）。可是一到展览馆前，我见观众人山人海，心里就感到惊讶；进展览馆之后，德国画展立刻给我极深刻的国际主义教育。原来这批油画是战前德国德累斯顿画院的陈列品。在德国法西斯溃败的时候，苏联红军曾在一个阴湿的盐矿里发现这大批油画，其中许多世界名画业已损坏。苏联红军发现这批世界珍贵艺术品之后，就运到苏联。经过苏联艺术家们的修理与保管，又在德国德累斯顿油画馆修复之后，由苏联政府作出决定交还给民主德国政府与人民。在送回到民主德国之前，苏联政府决定在莫斯科举行展览三个月。无怪乎苏联人民要争先恐后地去欣赏这批德国人民的艺术珍品了。对这次展览的参观曾给我极深刻的影响。因为1929年我在德国做学生的时候，曾参观过德累斯顿的画廊，其中最著名的一幅油画是意大利文艺复兴时代的艺术大师拉斐尔的西克斯丁圣母像。当我进入莫斯科德国画展的大门后见到这幅作品时，我心里感到非常的亲切，非常的感动：亲切的是在青年时代所看到的这幅名画居然经过法西斯战争、美国飞机的滥炸（英雄的红军正要解放德累斯顿的时候，美国飞机在一个晚上就把这个世界名城毁灭了）仍旧存在；感动的是苏联政府无比伟大的国际主义精神。我也想到了美、英、法、日等帝国主义掠夺我国文物的不可饶恕的罪行。美帝国主义盗窃了我国昭陵八骏中的两骏，拆走了热河的喇嘛庙；英法帝国主义偷走敦煌的文物。谁是我们的朋友，谁是我们的敌人，文教艺术界的右派分子们可以认清楚了。
    在伟大的、光荣的、正确的苏联共产党领导下，苏联人民在短短的四十年内，把一个落后的农业国变成了一个先进的工业国。在短短的四十年里，苏联人民击败了帝国主义的干涉，镇压了国内白党的叛乱，扑灭了托派的阴谋，战胜了凶恶的法西斯敌人，打垮了号称日本最精锐的关东军。在十月革命三十周年到四十周年的短短十年里，优秀的苏联科学技术人员掌握了原子能并发明了世界第一座原子能发电站，修建了世界上最大的一百亿电子伏同步稳相加速器；苏联的航空事业是全世界最先进的航空事业，苏联的喷气式民用航空机，是全世界最完善的民用航空的交通工具。当苏联政府宣称已发射了洲际弹道导弹的时候，以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义阵营尚将信将疑。可是在苏联发射了第一颗人造卫星之后，帝国主义阵营，特别是它的首领美帝国主义，表现得惊慌失措。看到与听到人造卫星的事实，不得不正视苏联在科学技术上也是一个巨人。在过去短短的十年里苏联共产党不独领导苏联人民在工农业生产上获得了最高的生产力的生长率，在科学技术上在主要方面也已超过了资本主义最先进的国家。同时他们也帮助了我国恢复国民经济，建设工农业，协助教学改革，开展科学研究。苏联优秀的工程技术人员帮助我们把公路修上世界屋脊，修建大型水库，制造机车、轮船与飞机，在长江上修造第一座大桥，使天堑从此变通途。在今后我们建设社会主义的工作里，我们还要大规模地开展我们的科学研究工作，要实现我们去年所制订的十二年科学技术远景规划，要在十二年内赶上世界的先进水平。为此，我们还要更多地依靠苏联在科学技术上的帮助，而苏联也一定会给我们以无私的帮助。
    十月革命以来的历史的发展，充分地说明了这样一个事实：由于中国人民在伟大的中国共产党领导下走十月革命的道路，中国人民解放事业与社会主义建设取得了辉煌的历史性的胜利。我们也看到了，中国科学技术的发展在过去八年来走苏联社会主义的道路，已获得了巨大的成就，今后一定会获得更辉煌的成就。在光荣的十月革命节四十周年到来的时候，我们中国科学工作者和中国人民一道，和全世界爱好和平的人民一道，抱着饮水思源十分感激与欢欣鼓舞的心情来迎接这个伟大的、历史性的节日。我们并衷心地祝贺苏联人民在苏联共产党与苏联政府领导下在建设共产主义的事业里，获得更辉煌的成就，使中苏两国的紧密团结更加巩固、更加坚强。让我们高呼：
    伟大的苏联共产党万岁！
    伟大的苏联政府万岁！
    伟大的苏联人民万岁！
