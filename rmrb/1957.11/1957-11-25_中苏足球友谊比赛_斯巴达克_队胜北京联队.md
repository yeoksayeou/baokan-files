    Sino-Soviet Football Friendship Match
    "Spartak" Team Defeats Beijing Team

    (Our newspaper reports) On the 24th, in a football friendship match held in Beijing, the "Spartak" team from Minsk, Byelorussian SSR, defeated the Beijing United team by a score of 3-0. On the 27th, they will also hold a friendly match with the Changchun team.

    The game yesterday saw the visiting team demonstrating quick passing, active running, and strong defense. They not only successfully used a full-court, man-to-man pressing defense to thwart the opponent's attack, but also, with great speed, launched fierce offensives with long passes in a split second. The home team also showed active tackling and energetic running for a period, but their forwards dribbled too much. After getting the ball, they didn't pass it out quickly, but instead weaved around, eventually being intercepted by the opponent. The connection between the defense and the offense was also poor, and disconnections often occurred.

    Just two minutes after the kickoff, the home team launched its first attack. Midfielder Zhang Jingtian received the ball and passed it to right winger Cong Zheyu. Cong Zheyu cleverly cooperated with right forward Zhang Honggen, dribbling the ball to the end line and sweeping it fiercely. The ball rolled along the ground past the penalty area straight towards the left side of the goal. At this moment, left winger Cui Hengxie tried to catch up and shoot, but he was a little too slow, and the ball had already crossed the end line. Although the visiting team was startled, they did not become disorganized. Their active running and quick passing allowed them to gradually take control of the game. In the seventh minute of the match, visiting team center forward Nikulenko received a pass from the backfield near the center line in the offensive zone. He dribbled past home team defender Sun Yuming and cut diagonally to the right. At this point, the other two home team defenders, Wang Xinsheng and Jiang Jexiang, rushed to surround him, trying to intercept, but they were half a step short. Huang Zhaowen was also not calm enough, and he pounced towards the left side of the goal. Seeing Huang Zhaowen pouncing to the left, Nikulenko gently pushed the ball towards the right side of the goal. The ball slowly rolled into the net at an angle of about 30 degrees. After scoring a goal, the visiting team's offensive became even more fierce, and the home team went all out to strengthen their defense.

    The first half ended with a score of 1-0.

    In the second half, the home team substituted Sun Baorong and Fang Renqiu for center forward Wang Xiweng and defender Sun Yuming, and moved left forward Nian Weisheng to center forward to strengthen their attack and try to reverse the defeat. Just three minutes after the start, Fang Renqiu and Nian Weisheng cooperated cleverly, passing the ball to right winger Cong Zheyu for a shot, but unfortunately, the ball went slightly out of bounds. In the eighth minute, home team midfielder Zhang Jingtian committed a foul half a meter outside the penalty area. Visiting team right forward Dubrovsky took the free kick, and the ball rolled straight towards the goal. Goalkeeper Huang Zhaowen dived to save the ball, but it slipped out after he caught it, landing right in front of Nikulenko, who volleyed it into the net. In order to reverse the situation, the home team also organized many attacks, but because of excessive individual dribbling and short passes, and slow passing, they never posed a significant threat to the opponent. On the contrary, the visiting team's offensive often threatened them. Ten minutes before the end of the match, visiting team left winger Hassin shot from 25 meters away from the goal. Although it was a long shot, it was fast and powerful, and Huang Zhaowen could not save it in time. The ball grazed his hand and flew into the net. The final score was 3-0, with the visiting team winning.

    中苏足球友谊比赛
    “斯巴达克”队胜北京联队
    本报讯　24日，在北京举行的一场足球友谊比赛中，苏联白俄罗斯明斯克市“斯巴达克”队以三比○战胜了北京市联队。27日还将与长春队举行友谊赛。
    昨天比赛情况是：客队出球迅速、跑动积极和防守得好。他们不但成功地运用了全场紧迫人盯人的防守战术阻止了对方的进攻，而且以很快的速度，在一刹那间一脚长传就组成了猛烈的攻势。主队虽然也曾在一个时期内表现得抢球积极、奔跑活跃，但是他们的前锋盘带过多，得球后，不是很快地传递出去，而是在那里拐来拐去，最后被对方截去。后卫和前锋的联系也不好，经常出现了脱节的现象。
    开球后，刚二分钟，主队就发动了第一次进攻，前卫张京天得球后，传给右翼丛者余，丛者余巧妙地和右锋张宏根配合，将球带到底线后举脚猛扫，球沿着地面越过禁区直向门的左边滚去，这时左翼崔亨燮企图赶上扫射，可惜慢了一点，球已越出端线。客队虽受了一惊，并未因此混乱，积极的跑动和迅速的传递，使他们逐渐掌握了主动权。比赛进行到第七分钟时，客队中锋尼库连柯在前场靠近中线的地方得后方来球，带球前进晃过主队后卫孙玉明，又向右方斜入，这时主队另两个后卫王新生和姜杰祥急急向他围拢过来力图堵截，但差半步没有赶上，黄肇文也不够沉着，他就向大门左方扑出，这时尼库连柯见黄肇文扑向左方，他却将球向门右方轻轻一拨，皮球以约三十度角，徐徐滚入网中。客队得一球后，攻势更为猛烈，主队全力以赴，加强防守。
    上半时以一比○告终。
    下半场，主队以孙宝荣、方纫秋换下中锋王锡文和后卫孙玉明，将左锋年维泗调任中锋，加强进攻力量，力图挽回败局。开始后，刚三分钟，方纫秋和年维泗就巧妙配合，两下传递把球送给右翼丛者余打门，可惜球稍偏出界。八分钟时，主队前卫张京天在禁区界外半公尺处犯规，客队右锋杜布洛夫斯基主罚，球擦着地直滚向门前，守门员黄肇文卧地扑球，球接住后又滑出，正好落在尼库连柯跟前，他就地飞起一脚射中。主队为了挽回局势，也曾多次地组织进攻，但因个人盘带和短传过多，出球又慢，始终没有使对方感受到较大的威胁。相反，客队的攻势经常威胁着他们。比赛结束前十分钟，客队左翼哈辛在离门二十五公尺以外的地方射门，这虽然是一个远射，但又急又劲，黄肇文来不及扑救。球擦过他手边，飞入网内。全场三比○，客队胜。
