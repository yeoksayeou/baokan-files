Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, October 31st. The Gansu Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held its Second Plenary Session (Enlarged) from the 17th to the 26th to discuss how to implement the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the CPC in the Gansu area. After extensive debate, the meeting proposed an ambitious plan: within five years, the annual grain output of the province will increase from the estimated 10 billion jin in 1957 to 17 billion jin, and all agricultural cooperatives will catch up with or exceed the production level of wealthy middle peasants in three to five years.

The average yield per mu in Gansu Province is currently 176 jin. By 1962, it should reach 270 to 280 jin, with an annual increase rate of approximately 9%. The meeting believes that to achieve this ambitious plan, vigorous measures must be taken, primarily the construction of water conservancy projects and the development of soil and water conservation. By 1962, the province should expand the area of irrigated land by 18 million mu and control soil erosion over an area of 100,000 square kilometers. If these two tasks are done well, grain output in 1962 can increase by 4 to 5 billion jin compared to 1953. The fertilizer problem should be solved using a "let a hundred flowers bloom" approach, with the focus on mass accumulation of fertilizer and the active development of phosphate fertilizer, nitrogen fertilizer, peat, and bacterial fertilizer. Other aspects, such as improving cultivation techniques, improving agricultural tools, and improving the management of cooperatives, must also be vigorously pursued. More than 60% of Gansu is mountainous, so developing mountainous areas and mobilizing people in the plains to go to the mountains is of great significance.

The meeting discussed the full cooperation of various sectors of the economy, believing that local industry should serve the development of agriculture well, supply large quantities of fertilizer and agricultural tools, and pay special attention to the manufacture of water-lifting irrigation machinery, such as waterwheels and pumps, because approximately 10 million mu of land in Gansu can be developed for water-lifting irrigation. In terms of commerce, the procurement of local specialties should be strengthened, and the prices of local specialties that need to be developed should be adjusted. In terms of culture and education, agricultural scientific research work should be decentralized, the promotion of technology to the countryside should be encouraged, attention should be paid to training farmer technicians, and local diseases should be vigorously prevented and treated to create conditions for the development of mountainous areas. Agricultural production should adapt to the development of industry, increasing the production of economic crops such as cotton and sugar beets. Gansu will build sugar factories, alcohol factories, etc., within five years, and the output value of local industry may increase more than twofold by 1962, reaching more than 400 million yuan.

The meeting also discussed the issues of streamlining institutions and the anti-rightist struggle. This year, Gansu Province has already reduced its staff by 21,000 people, of whom more than 10,000 have returned to the countryside to participate in production, and more than 2,700 cadres above the district level have been sent down in stages. However, the various levels of agencies, enterprises, and institutions are still very bloated. Many of the main cadres above the county level have no grassroots work experience, and 80% to 85% of the general cadres are intellectuals who joined the workforce after liberation, most of whom have not participated in labor. The meeting believes that revolutionary methods must be adopted to further streamline the number of personnel in party and government agencies by more than 15% on the basis of the streamlining already carried out this year, reduce the administrative management personnel in industrial and mining enterprises to within 10%, reduce the number of personnel in commercial enterprises to within 12%, and reduce the number of personnel in state-owned farms to around 2%. The streamlining will be completed by the end of December, and most of the streamlined personnel will participate in agricultural production. In addition, after streamlining the institutions, leading cadres will also take turns working at the grassroots level, and general cadres will be sent to the countryside and factories in batches within six years to participate in labor production. Cadres who are sent down must pay attention to summarizing their experience and writing articles as "graduation theses". Cadres who go to production posts and cannot withstand the test of labor should be considered unqualified as cadres.

The anti-rightist struggle in all levels of agencies across the province has already achieved significant victories, and the first batch of agencies has now shifted to a stage focused on improving work. According to statistics up to the 18th, a total of 240 factories and mines in the province, with approximately 100,000 workers, have launched a great blooming and contending, posting more than 40,000 big-character posters and putting forward nearly 80,000 opinions. In the countryside, more than 12,200 agricultural cooperatives are now conducting great debates, and more than 20,000 cadres at all levels have been sent to participate in the great debates in various places. The meeting believes that leaders at all levels must fully mobilize the masses, resolutely launch a great blooming and contending, and adopt revolutionary methods to solve problems. In the later stages of the great debates, factories and rural areas should debate production increase plans.

The meeting also severely criticized the leadership style in Gansu Province, which is currently seriously detached from reality, believing that if this situation continues to develop, it will turn into a "gentleman on the beam" who is neither connected to the top nor to the bottom. The prominent manifestation of this leadership style is a lack of research and poor work summarization. Gansu has many mass-based creations, such as bringing water to the mountains, changing the face of drought, and the masses running primary and secondary schools. However, these good experiences have not been seriously summarized. Therefore, this has provided an excuse for the right-leaning thinking of some cadres. The meeting believes that this leadership style must be resolutely transformed ideologically and organizationally.

### 甘肃提出发展农业的宏伟计划

    甘肃提出发展农业的宏伟计划
    五年内粮食年产量达到一百七十亿斤，每年增产率9％
    强调兴修水利、水土保持、发展山区、各种经济充分协作
    新华社兰州31日电　中共甘肃省委17日到26日召开省委二届五次全体扩大会议，讨论如何在甘肃地区贯彻执行中共三中全会的精神。会议经过大争辩后提出了一个宏伟的计划：五年内全省粮食年产量由1957年的一百零几亿斤（预计数）达到一百七十亿斤，三年到五年所有农业社要赶上或超过富裕中农的生产水平。
    甘肃省现在平均每亩产量是一百七十六斤，到1962年要达到二百七十至二百八十斤，每年增产率为9％左右。会议认为，要实现这个宏伟的计划，必须采取有力的措施，主要的是兴修水利和开展水土保持工作。到1962年，全省要扩大水地和水浇地一千八百万亩，控制水土流失面积十万平方公里。这两项工作搞好以后，1962年比1953年就可增产四十亿到五十亿斤粮食。肥料问题要实行“百花齐放”的解决办法，以群众积肥为主，积极发展磷肥、氮肥、泥煤和细菌肥料等。其他关于改进耕作技术，改良农具，改善合作社的经营管理等，都须要大力进行。甘肃60％以上是山区，因此发展山区、动员平川地区人民上山，就有很大的意义。
    会议就各种经济的充分协作问题进行了讨论，认为地方工业要很好地为农业的发展服务、大量供应肥料和农具，在甘肃特别要注意制造提水灌溉机械，如水车、抽水机等，因为甘肃大约有一千万亩地可以发展提水灌溉。商业方面要加强收购土特产品，调整需要发展的土特产品价格。文教方面要分散设置农业科学研究工作，提倡技术下乡，注意训练农民技术员，大力防治地方病，为开发山区创造条件。农业生产要适应工业的发展，增产棉花、甜菜等经济作物，甘肃在五年内要建设糖厂、酒精厂等，地方工业产值到1962年有可能提高两倍多，达到四亿元以上。
    会议还讨论了紧缩机构和反右派斗争等问题。今年甘肃省已经缩减了二万一千人，其中有一万多人已回到农村参加生产，有二千七百多名区以上干部已经分层下放。但是，目前各级机关、企业和事业单位仍然很臃肿。县级以上主要干部很多没有基层工作经验，一般干部中80％——85％是解放后参加工作的知识分子，他们大多数没有参加过劳动。会议认为，要采取革命的办法，在今年已经紧缩的基础上，党政机关的人数再紧缩15％以上，工矿企业的行政管理人员减到10％以内，商业企业减到12％以内，国营农场减到2％左右。12月底紧缩完毕，紧缩下来的人员大部分去参加农业生产。此外，紧缩机构以后，领导骨干还要轮流到基层工作，一般干部要在六年内分批到农村、工厂去参加劳动生产。下放的干部必须注意总结经验，写成文章，作为
  “毕业论文”。到生产岗位去的干部，如经不起劳动的考验，应被看做是不够干部资格。
    全省各级机关反右派斗争已经取得重大胜利，目前第一批机关已转入以改进工作为主的阶段。到18日的统计，全省共有二百四十个厂矿企业约十万工人展开了大鸣大放，贴出的大字报有四万多张，提出的意见近八万条。农村中现在已有一万二千二百多个农业社进行大辩论，各地派下去参加大辩论的各级干部达两万多人。会议认为，各级领导必须充分发动群众，坚决展开大鸣大放，采取革命的办法来解决问题。工厂和农村在大辩论的后期要辩论增产规划。
    会议还严厉地批评了甘肃省目前严重存在的脱离实际的领导作风，认为这种情况发展下去，会变成上不着天下不着地的“梁上君子”。这种领导作风的突出表现是研究少、总结工作差。甘肃有很多群众性的创造，例如，水地上山，改变干旱面貌，群众办中小学等等。但是，这些好经验却没有认真地加以总结。因此，给一些干部的右倾思想找到了借口。会议认为必须从思想上和组织上坚决转变这种领导作风。
