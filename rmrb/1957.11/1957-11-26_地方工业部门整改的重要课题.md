    An Important Topic for Rectification in Local Industrial Departments
    Kong Sang
    Supporting agriculture is an important task for industrial departments. Because of China's vast territory, complex terrain, and widely varying climates, agricultural production in different regions has many different characteristics. In order to meet the different needs of various localities in a way that suits local conditions, local industrial departments bear a particularly important responsibility. During the rectification movement, the Sichuan Provincial Department of Industry organized all its cadres to engage in "blooming and contending" discussions on the issue of how local industry can serve agriculture. Everyone exposed many shortcomings and also put forward positive suggestions. We believe that doing so is very necessary, and we hope that the local industrial departments of other provinces, special districts, and counties will also do so. First, check whether the policy of serving agriculture has been conscientiously implemented in the past, and then check whether attention has been paid to local characteristics in the implementation of this policy. It is necessary to check not only how the means of production serving agricultural production are supplied, but also how the consumer goods serving the lives of farmers are supplied. When organizing "blooming and contending," it is necessary to fully mobilize all the cadres in the management organs, but it is even more important to mobilize the cadres and all the workers and staff in the subordinate enterprises; in particular, it is necessary to go to agricultural cooperatives to actively solicit the opinions of rural cadres and farmers, and to formulate improvement measures based on their opinions.
    Winter is coming, and the task of supporting rural water conservancy construction is now urgent. There is also not much time for production preparations to supply more and better new-style farm tools and mineral fertilizers in the coming spring plowing. Local industrial departments in various regions should immediately take action, seize this important topic, and quickly launch a high tide of support for agriculture.

    地方工业部门整改的重要课题	孔桑
    支援农业是工业部门的重要任务。由于我国幅员广大，地形复杂，气候悬殊，各地农业生产具有许多不同的特点。为了因地制宜地满足各个地方各种不同的需要，地方工业部门负有特殊重要的责任。四川省工业厅在整风运动中，组织全体干部就地方工业如何为农业服务的问题展开鸣放，大家揭发了许多缺点，也提出了积极的建议。我们认为，这样做是非常必要的，希望其他省份、专区和县的地方工业部门也都这样做。首先检查过去是不是认真执行了为农业服务的方针，再检查在执行这个方针中是不是注意了当地的特点。既需要检查为农业生产服务的生产资料供应得怎样，也需要检查为农民生活服务的消费资料供应得怎样。在组织鸣放的时候，要充分发动管理机关中的全体干部，但是更要重视发动所属企业中的干部和全体职工；特别是要到农业合作社去，主动征求农村干部和农民的意见，根据他们的意见来拟订改进的措施。
    冬天到来了，支援农村水利建设的任务已刻不容缓；要在来年春耕中供应更多和更好的新式农具和矿物肥料，生产准备工作的时间也并不充裕。各地的地方工业部门应当立即行动起来，抓住这个重要的课题，迅速地掀起一个支援农业的高潮。
