    Old Man Feng Climbs the Chimney Three Times
    Li Lunxin
    Walking into the gate of the brewery, I saw workers sweeping with joy. I headed straight for the Party branch office.
    Secretary Chen of the branch office saw me come in, quickly got up to greet me, poured me a glass of water, and sat down beside me. Just as he was about to say something, an old worker with gray hair, long eyebrows, and a thin face full of wrinkles limped in and said loudly, "Secretary Chen, look, is it okay to write these few sentences?" He handed over a slip of paper. Old Chen took the paper and looked at it. I leaned over and saw that the paper read:
        Long Live the People's Republic of China!
        Long Live the Chinese Communist Party!
        Long Live Socialism!
          Long Live Chairman Mao!
    After reading it, Old Chen took off his thick glasses and looked at the old worker, saying, "Yes, it's fine. Where are you going to write it?"
      "That goes without saying, on top of the chimney, so that all of Shanghai can see it!" The old worker said, turning to leave. Old Chen quickly said, "Old—you can't climb up that high." Unexpectedly, this stopped the old worker, who was so angry that veins popped out on his forehead. "You're saying I'm old and useless again! Who else has ever climbed that chimney besides me? Look, strong or not?" As he spoke, he rolled up his sleeves and patted his thick, dark arms with his right hand, clearly somewhat indignant. Old Chen quickly smiled apologetically and said with a hint of self-criticism, "You're not old, you can do it." Only then did he leave. Old Chen and I watched him go out.
    Old Chen laughed heartily and said, "This old man is really interesting, he's clearly over sixty but still refuses to admit he's old." After speaking, he picked up the phone and said, "Connect me to the General Affairs Section." I asked inexplicably, "What's going on?" Old Chen said into the phone, "General Affairs Section? ... Old Man Feng wants to go to the top of the chimney to paint slogans, you guys go and take care of it." After speaking, Old Chen said to me, "He's really a quirky old worker. He wants to be involved in everything in the factory, but nine times out of ten, he's right, and everyone admires him."
    "Has he really been the only one to climb to the top of that chimney?" I asked.
    "That's true..." Then Old Chen told me about the times Old Man Feng had climbed the chimney:
    "Back in 1949, the boss made a fortune by speculating and adulterating products. He replaced the small stove for making soy sauce with a large stove and erected a large chimney. The boss deliberately asked the masons to build the chimney tall and large. After it was built, he knew that Old Man Feng had worked in an advertising company before, so he asked Old Man Feng to paint the factory name and the words "Wanzi Old Brand Soy Sauce, Genuine and Fair Price" on the chimney. When Old Man Feng saw these words, he was so angry that he threw the draft on the ground and said, "I won't do such a conscienceless thing. It's clear that the soy sauce is adulterated and made for profiteering, yet you write such deceptive words!" This infuriated the boss, who came running over and said fiercely, "It's up to you, if you don't paint it, you're fired tomorrow!" Old Man Feng had suffered the pain of unemployment and thought about how he had just been introduced to this factory and hadn't received his salary yet to feed his wife and children, who had been hungry for several days. He didn't say anything more, but he was still determined not to do this deceptive thing, so he came up with a plan. He agreed to the boss and climbed up the ladders, tied together section by section. When he climbed to a place that wasn't too high, he deliberately fell down. His leg was injured in that fall. The boss was afraid of spending money on treating the injured, so he didn't ask anyone else to paint the words, and as a result, the tall chimney remained blank.
      "Last year, when the whole city celebrated the public-private partnership with gongs and drums, the workers in our factory were joyfully busy with sweeping and putting up slogans, removing the old sign and painting a new sign for the public-private partnership. No one thought about writing a sign on the big chimney, but Old Man Feng thought of it. He brought a ladder and tied it together section by section. Just as he was about to climb up, everyone stopped him, saying that it was dangerous and that an unfortunate incident shouldn't happen on a joyous day. But he smiled and said, "Do you really think the chimney will eat people? That time I fell down was because I wanted to fall. If I don't want to fall, I definitely won't fall!" No one could dissuade him. He climbed up, climbing so quickly and nimbly. In less than half a day, he painted the bright red words "Public-Private Partnership ×× Brewery" on the chimney..."
    Just as he was saying this, there was a commotion outside the window. Old Chen stopped talking and walked out of the office with me.
    We saw over a hundred people gathered at the foot of the chimney. By the long ladder leaning against the chimney, Old Man Feng was holding a can of paint, unable to climb up because several young people were holding him back: "Let me go up, Master." "Let me go up, Teacher Feng." "Let me go up, Old Man Feng."
    More people were clamoring, and it was impossible to hear what they were saying. A young man ran over and spread his hands out to Old Chen, saying, "Secretary Chen, such a high chimney top, not many young people dare to go up there. Old Man Feng has a bad leg, how can he go up? Please persuade him!" Old Chen nodded and squeezed over to Old Man Feng, saying, "Old Feng, I think the sign with the factory name up there is pretty good, why don't you just leave it." Who knew that Old Man Feng would angrily throw his hand down and say, "Who doesn't know that our factory is either state-owned or a public-private partnership? Now that I'm writing this slogan, when the factory becomes state-owned in the future, I'll climb up again and write the sign for the state-owned ×× Brewery." As he spoke, he started climbing up again. Seeing that Old Chen couldn't persuade him either, the others didn't try to persuade him anymore. Everyone silently looked up at Old Man Feng climbing up rung by rung, climbing so quickly and nimbly. People stood around the chimney, on guard in case something happened. Old Chen and I also stood there looking up. When Old Man Feng's calves shook halfway up, everyone held their breath for him. The people below shouted, "Old Man Feng, come down! Master, come down and let me go up!" He stopped and shook his hand down, and then quickly climbed up again. Soon, he had reached the summit. He tied the thick rope to the chimney to secure himself, and like a monkey, he started painting. The people below were all absorbed in watching. I was also attracted by the scene and stood there watching until the western sky was swallowed up by the mountains and the evening glow hung in the sky. The bright red characters were already painted on top of the chimney:
        Long Live the People's Republic of China!
        Long Live the Chinese Communist Party!
        Long Live Socialism!
          Long Live Chairman Mao!
    Old Man Feng looked down with a smile. Enthusiastic applause and cheers rang out below. Old Man Feng straddled the top of the ladder, clamped his legs tightly, and clapped his hands too!

    冯老头三上烟囱顶
    李伦新
    走进酿造厂的大门，工人们充满欢快的心情在大扫除，我直往党支部办公室走去。
    支部书记老陈见我进来，忙起身招呼，倒来一杯开水，坐到我身边，正要说什么时，一个头发灰白、长眉毛、瘦长的脸上满是皱纹的老工人一跛一跛地走进来大声说：“陈书记，你看，写上这几句行吗？”说着递过来一张纸条，老陈接过纸条在看，我凑过去，见纸条上写的是：
        中华人民共和国万岁！
        中国共产党万岁！
        社会主义万岁！
          毛主席万岁！
    老陈看完，取下那深度近视的眼镜望望那老工人说：“行呀。你写在哪儿？”
      “这不用问，当然写在烟囱顶上，让全上海的人都能看见！”老工人说着拔脚要走了，老陈忙说：“你老——你可不能爬上那么高去哟。”哪知这一说，老工人倒停住了，气急得额上青筋条条绽出说：“你又说我老了、不行了！那烟囱上除了我还有谁上去过？你看，结棍不结棍？”他说着卷起袖子，用右手拍打着粗壮的、黝黑的手臂，显然有些气愤的样子。老陈忙陪笑着带点检讨的意味说：“你没老，你行。”他才走去。老陈和我目送他走出去。
    老陈爽朗地笑笑说：“这老头真有趣，明明六十多岁了还不服老。”说完，拿起话筒说：“接总务科。”我莫名其妙地随口问道：“这是怎么会事？”老陈对着话筒说：“总务科吗？……冯老头要上烟囱顶去漆标语，你们去照管一下。”说完，老陈对我说：“真是个古怪的老工人，厂里无论什么事他都要管，不过，十有九他都管得对的，大家都佩服他。”
    “那烟囱顶真的只有他一个人上去过？”我问。
    “那倒不假，……”接着老陈向我述说了冯老头几次爬上烟囱顶的事：
    “在1949年的时候，老板靠投机、掺假发了财，烧酱油的小灶改砌大灶，竖了个大烟囱，老板有心叫泥水匠把烟囱砌得又高又大，砌好后，他知道冯老头过去在广告公司做过，叫冯老头到烟囱上去漆上厂名和“万字老牌酱油，货真价实”几个大字，冯老头一看是这几个字，气得把纸稿一掼说：“我是不做这种昧良心的事，明明酱油掺假又图暴利还写上这种骗人的话！”这可把老板触怒了，跑来凶狠狠地说：“随便你，不漆明天就给我滚蛋！”冯老头是饱尝失业痛苦的，想到刚刚托人介绍到这个厂里，还没拿到工资回去养活饿了几天的老婆孩子，没有再吭声，但心里还是在誓死也不做这桩骗人的事，于是他想了个办法，答应了老板，到架好一节节绑起来的梯子，他爬上去，爬到不算太高的地方时，故意跌了下来，腿就是这次跌伤的。老板因为怕伤了人要花钱，也就再没叫人上去漆字，因此，这个高大的烟囱一直是白踏踏的。
      “去年全市锣鼓喧天庆祝公私合营的时候，我们厂里的工人都欢天喜地忙着大扫除贴标语，铲掉了原来的老招牌，漆上了公私合营的新招牌，谁也没想到在大烟囱去写招牌，冯老头却想到了，他搬来扶梯，一节一节的绑好，正要爬上去时，大家都拉住他，说这是危险的，喜日子里不能弄出不幸的事来，可他却笑笑说：‘你们当真的以为烟囱会吃人？那次跌下来是我自己要跌的，我不要跌就保险不会跌！’大家劝阻不住，他爬上去了，爬得那么快，那么敏捷，不到半天时间就在烟囱上漆上了‘公私合营××酿造厂’几个鲜红的大字。……”
    正说到这里，窗外传来了嚷闹声，老陈停止了述说，和我一起，走出办公室。
    只见烟囱脚下，簇拥百多人，架在烟囱上的长扶梯边，冯老头提着只漆罐头欲上不能，被几个年轻人拖住：“师傅让我上去吧。”“老师傅让我上去吧。”“冯师傅让我上去吧。”
    更多的人在闹嚷嚷的，说些什么也听不清楚，有个小伙子跑来朝老陈手一摊说：“陈书记，这么高的烟囱顶，年轻人也没几个敢上去的，冯老头他脚不好，怎么能上去呢，你快去说服说服他吧！”老陈点点头，抢步挤过去对冯老头说：“老冯，我看上面写得蛮好的招牌字，就不要去换它吧。”谁知冯老头生气地手一掼说：“谁不知道我们的工厂不是国营的就是合营的，现在写这标语，将来厂变国营了，我再上去写上国营××酿造厂的招牌好了。”说着，他又往上爬了，别人见老陈也说服不了他，也就没再去啰嗦了，大家都默不作声地仰面望着冯老头一档一档地爬上去，爬得那么快，那么敏捷，人们站在烟囱周围戒备着，以防万一，我和老陈也站在那里抬头看着，当冯老头爬到半空中腿肚子发抖地一幌，每个人都为他捏了一把汗，下面的人都喊起来：“冯师傅，还是下来吧！师傅下来让我上去！”他停住脚，用手朝下只摇，之后，又迅速地往上爬去，不一会，他已爬到顶峰了，用那粗绳子套在烟囱上系住自己的身子，像只猴子似地刷将起来，下面的人们都出神地望着，我也被这场面吸引住了，一直站在那儿望着，直到西边天空夕阳被高山吞没、晚霞挂了起来，烟囱顶上已写好了鲜艳的大红字：
        中华人民共和国万岁！
        中国共产党万岁！
        社会主义万岁！
          毛主席万岁！
    冯老头朝下笑嘻嘻地望着，下面响起了热烈的掌声和欢呼声，冯老头骑在梯子顶上，用两腿夹紧，也拍起手来！
