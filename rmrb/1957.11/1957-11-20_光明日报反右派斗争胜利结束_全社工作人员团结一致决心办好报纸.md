    (Our Newspaper) Guangming Daily's anti-Rightist struggle has achieved a great victory, and now all staff members are working together to improve their work, determined to run this socialist newspaper well.
    Beginning in mid-June, all employees resolutely and thoroughly liquidated Zhang Bojun and Chu Anping's bourgeois newspaper management line, bringing the newspaper back onto the socialist track. During this period, a resolute struggle was waged against the Rightists within the newspaper who actively supported Zhang Bojun and Chu Anping's attempt to篡改(usurp and alter) the newspaper's political line. A total of fifteen Rightists were identified, in addition to the Rightist ringleaders Zhang Bojun and Chu Anping. They are: Pan Wenbin (pen name Wen Bing), Director of the Education Department of the Editorial Department's School Education Section; Wang Shaotong, Second Director of the Party Department; Zhang Yinhuai, Deputy Director of the News Department; editors and reporters Zheng Xiaofeng, Xu Ying (female), Xu Zimei, Yin Yi, Qian Tonggang, Xiao En Yuan, Xie Jie (female), etc.
    During the period of Great Blooming and Letting a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend, these Rightists faithfully implemented Chu Anping's bourgeois reactionary newspaper management policy of "only exposing" and "singing a counter-tune" to the Communist Party. They organized and wrote a large number of reactionary articles and inflammatory, destructive reports, viciously attacking and slandering the Communist Party's leadership over various undertakings—first and foremost, cultural, educational, and scientific undertakings; negating the great achievements made by the Communist Party and the government in various tasks; and inciting and provoking intellectuals to be dissatisfied with the Communist Party and resist transformation. They said, "Our task is to expose, and the analysis and improvement are the Communist Party's business!" They advocated turning Guangming Daily into an "opposition party newspaper" that was completely detached from the leadership of the Communist Party and opposed socialism. They closely cooperated with the rampant attacks of bourgeois Rightists in society, stirring up trouble and instigating waves everywhere. In the editorial commemorating the "May Fourth" Movement, they maliciously incited people: "Don't be a cold insect," but "muster strength and greet the spring." (This editorial was written by Pan Wenbin, Chu Anping's henchman, and published after being personally reviewed by Chu). They spared no space, publishing full-page records of inflammatory seminars, and promoting them both inside and outside the newspaper, saying that "every speech is the best editorial!" "And it is the best form of editorial!" They regarded the false report of "Fudan University Abolishing the Party Committee System," which confused public opinion, as a "scoop," and used it to wantonly denigrate the correct reports of the "People's Daily." They enthusiastically supported and implemented Zhang Bojun and Chu Anping's reactionary newspaper management line, with some saying, "Whoever feels nervous about this situation is not worthy to work at Guangming Daily!" They regarded Guangming Daily at that time as a world firmly held by the Rightists.
    These sinful activities of the Rightist elements in the editorial department, led by Chu Anping, were applauded by a small group of Rightist elements in society, who wrote nauseating congratulatory letters to Chu Anping, calling Guangming Daily at that time "our own newspaper." However, the broad masses of righteous readers raised questions one after another, asking "Guangming Daily has deteriorated!" and hoping that Guangming Daily would return to the correct path it had taken before May of this year.
    It was precisely under the concern and support of the broad masses of readers, and under the inspiration of the "People's Daily" editorial on June 8, that some staff members of the Guangming Daily editorial department, who had been temporarily deceived by Chu Anping, became clear-headed, and everyone saw the true face of Chu Anping, the political careerist, and resolutely fought against these Rightist elements who used news to attack the Communist Party.
    After several months of mass-based reasoning, criticism, and struggle, most of these Rightist elements had to bow their heads and confess their guilt.
    At present, Guangming Daily's anti-Rightist struggle has come to a victorious conclusion and has entered the stage of focusing on rectification. Through the practical exercise of the anti-Rightist struggle in the past few months, all employees of this newspaper, especially the staff of the editorial department, have received a vivid and concrete political and ideological education, and everyone has improved their political and ideological understanding and clarified many fundamental issues. Among them, the most profound understanding is that no work, especially a work with such a strong class nature as newspaper work, can be separated from the leadership of the Communist Party for a moment, otherwise, it will commit principled errors. Many comrades recalled with shame and regret their wavering stance and the rise of bourgeois ideology during the "blooming" and "contending" period, and deeply realized the harm and reaction of bourgeois news viewpoints. This is an extremely serious lesson. Many comrades resolutely stated that they must always remember this painful lesson, strive to study Marxism-Leninism and the party's policies, and constantly carry out ideological transformation, so as to gradually train themselves into genuine socialist journalists who can withstand risks, and run this socialist newspaper that should belong to the people well.

### 光明日报反右派斗争胜利结束  全社工作人员团结一致决心办好报纸

    光明日报反右派斗争胜利结束
    全社工作人员团结一致决心办好报纸
    本报讯　光明日报的反右派斗争已经取得巨大胜利，现在全体工作人员正在团结一致地努力改进工作，决心办好这张社会主义的报纸。
    6月中旬开始，全社职工坚决、彻底地清算了章伯钧、储安平的资产阶级办报路线，使报纸重新走上了社会主义轨道。在此时期，对报社内积极支持章伯钧、储安平篡改报纸政治路线的右派分子，进行了坚决的斗争。共清查出除右派头子章伯钧、储安平之外的右派分子十五人。他们是：编辑部学校教育部主任潘文彬（笔名文冰），党派部第二主任王少桐，要闻部副主任张荫槐，编辑、记者郑笑枫、徐颖（女）、许子美、殷毅、钱统纲、萧恩元、谢捷（女）等。
    这些右派分子，在大鸣大放期间，忠实执行储安平的“只管揭露”和同共产党“唱对台戏”的资产阶级反动办报方针，组织和采写了大量的反动文章和带煽动性、破坏性的报道，凶恶地攻击、诽谤共产党对各种事业——首先是文教、科学事业的领导；否定共产党和政府在各项工作中所取得的巨大成绩；煽动、挑拨知识分子对共产党不满、抗拒改造。他们说：“我们的任务就是揭露，分析改进是共产党的事！”他们主张把光明日报办成一张完全脱离共产党的领导的反对社会主义的“在野党的报纸”。他们密切配合着社会上资产阶级右派的猖狂进攻，到处煽风点火，推涛作浪。在纪念“五四”的社论中，恶毒地向人们煽动：“不要作寒虫”，而要“鼓起力量，迎接春天”。（这篇社论是由储安平的干将潘文彬执笔，经储亲自审阅发表的）。他们不惜篇幅，整版整版地刊登放火座谈会记录，并在社内社外宣扬其中
  “每一篇发言都是最好的社论！”“而且是社论的最好形式！”他们把混淆社会视听的“复旦大学取消党委制”假报道，说成是什么“独家新闻”，并借此肆意诋毁“人民日报”的正确报道。他们狂热地支持和执行章伯钧、储安平的反动办报路线，有的说什么“谁对这种局面感到紧张，谁就不配在光明日报工作下去！”他们把当时的光明日报看成右派坐稳了的天下。
    以储安平为首的编辑部右派分子的这些罪恶活动，曾获得了当时社会上一小撮右派分子的喝采，他们给储安平写来肉麻的贺信，把那一个时期的光明日报称做“我们自己的报纸”。但是，广大正义的读者却纷纷提出责问，提出“光明日报已经变了质！”期望光明日报恢复到今年5月以前的正确道路上去。
  正是在广大读者的这种关怀、支持下，在6月8日“人民日报”社论的启示下，曾经被储安平蒙蔽一时的光明日报编辑部的一些工作人员，头脑清醒过来了，大家看清楚了储安平这个政治野心家的真面目，纷纷起来向利用新闻手段向共产党进攻的这些右派分子展开了坚决的斗争。
    经过几个月来群众性的说理批判斗争，这些右派分子中的多数人不得不表示低头认罪。
    目前，光明日报反右派斗争已告胜利结束，并已转入着重整改阶段。经过这几个月反右派斗争的实际锻炼，本报全体职工，特别是编辑部工作人员，受到了一次生动具体的政治思想教育，大家在政治思想认识上有了提高，明确了许多根本问题。其中认识特别深刻的是，任何工作，特别是像报纸工作这样一种阶级性十分强烈的工作，一时一刻也不能离开共产党的领导，否则就要犯原则错误。许多同志怀着愧悔的心情回忆到“鸣”“放”期间自己立场的摇摆和资产阶级思想的抬头，深刻体会到资产阶级新闻观点的危害性和反动性。这是一个异常严重的教训。许多同志坚决地表示：一定要永远记住这次沉痛的教训，努力学习马克思列宁主义和党的政策，不断地进行思想改造，以便逐步地把自己锻炼成为一个经得起风险的名副其实的社会主义新闻工作者，把这张应该属于人民的社会主义的报纸办好。
