    (Reported by this newspaper) Feidong County convened a three-level cadre meeting on October 30th, the central content of which was summarizing production work, conscientiously studying and discussing the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft), and revising the county's five-year agricultural development plan and the 1958 plan.
    Since the promulgation of the National Agricultural Development Program (Draft) in January 1956, party and government leading departments at all levels in Feidong County have conscientiously publicized and implemented it. The County Party Committee organized cadres from the county, districts, townships, and agricultural cooperatives to study and discuss it. Various localities also used blackboard newspapers, local broadcasts, big-character posters, and other diverse forms to carry out extensive publicity activities. More than 85% of the agricultural cooperatives in the county have, through study and discussion, successively formulated preliminary plans for cooperation, production, and water conservancy. Encouraged by the National Agricultural Development Program (Draft), the broad masses of farmers have a clear goal for developing agricultural production, and their enthusiasm for production has reached unprecedented heights.
    Based on the spirit of the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) and the specific conditions for developing agricultural production in the county, the Feidong County Party Committee preliminarily proposed the county's agricultural development plan (draft) for 1958 to 1962 at this meeting. It requires that by 1962, the county will guarantee a grain yield of 700 jin per mu; an average cotton yield of 100 jin per mu (lint), an increase of 436% compared to 1957; an average oilseed yield of 352 jin per mu, an increase of 209.1% compared to 1957; a multiple cropping index increase from 158.7% in 1957 to 189.7%; and an increase of 103.8% in draught cattle compared to 1957.
    In order to achieve the targets of the agricultural development plan, the County Party Committee, based on the spirit of "three reforms," proposed the following measures: First, vigorously build water conservancy projects, requiring that by 1962, the county's irrigated area will account for 83% of the total cultivated land area. This winter and next spring, the county will ensure the completion of 20 million cubic meters of earthwork for farmland water conservancy, and strive to complete 25 million cubic meters. Second, accumulate natural fertilizer, increasing it from 200 million dan in 1957 to more than 270 million dan. In addition to adopting various methods of accumulating fertilizer, it is planned to plant 200,000 mu of green manure crops annually (excluding intercropping green manure), and ensure that every household has a toilet and livestock have pens. Third, prevent and eliminate plant diseases and insect pests. Fourth, promote superior varieties. Fifth, promote new-style farm tools. In addition to making full use of existing new-style farm tools such as double-wheeled double-shared plows, appropriately promote new-style farm tools such as disc harrows, ten-row seeders, and rocker-arm harvesters. It is also planned to establish two machine tractor stations. Sixth, breed livestock. The number of draught cattle in the county will increase from more than 44,000 in 1957 to more than 90,000. Seventh, plant trees and afforest. The county still needs to green an area of more than 670,000 mu, with an average of more than 130,000 mu completed annually within five years. Eighth, develop sideline production. By 1962, the number of pigs raised will reach 600,000, with an average of three pigs raised per household.
    The cadres attending the meeting are now conscientiously studying and discussing the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) and the county's five-year agricultural development program (draft). During the discussion, after careful analysis and accounting, everyone has full confidence in guaranteeing the completion of the requirements put forward by the County Party Committee in the plan within five years. At the same time, everyone also formulated plans for their respective districts, townships, and cooperatives based on the County Party Committee's plan and in combination with local conditions. In terms of grain yield targets, many townships and cooperatives have set targets that exceed the targets proposed by the County Party Committee by 5%. The cadres attending the meeting are all very confident and unanimously expressed their determination to complete the tasks put forward by the County Party Committee in the agricultural development plan.

    肥东县三级干部会认真讨论纲要
    订出农业规划组织生产高潮
    本报讯　总结生产工作，认真学习和讨论全国农业发展纲要（修正草案），修订本县发展农业的五年规划和1958年的规划，这是10月30日召开的肥东县三级干部会议的中心内容。
    自从1956年1月全国农业发展纲要（草案）公布以后，肥东县各级党、政领导部门，都认真作了宣传贯彻。县委曾组织了县、区、乡和农业社的干部进行学习和讨论；各地还利用黑板报、土广播、大字报等多种多样的形式，开展了广泛的宣传活动。全县已有85％以上的农业社，通过学习和讨论，先后订出了合作化、生产、水利等方面的初步规划。广大农民在全国农业发展纲要（草案）的鼓舞下，发展农业生产有了明确的目标，生产情绪空前高涨。
    中共肥东县委根据全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）的精神和本县发展农业生产的具体条件，在这次会上初步提出了全县1958年到1962年农业发展规划（草案）。要求到1962年，全县保证每亩产粮七百斤；棉花平均亩产一百斤（皮棉），比1957年增加436％；油料平均亩产三百五十二斤，比1957年增加209．1％；复种指数由1957年的158．7％提高到189．7％；和1957年相比，耕牛将增加103．8％。
    为了实现农业发展规划的指标，县委根据“三改”精神，提出了如下措施：一，大力兴修水利，要求到1962年全县灌溉面积占总耕地面积83％。今冬明春，全县兴修农田水利要保证完成两千万公方土方的任务，争取完成两千五百万公方。二，积蓄自然肥料，由1957年的二亿担增加到二亿七千多万担。除采用各种办法积肥外，计划每年种植二十万亩绿肥（套种绿肥不在内），并做到户户有厕所，牲畜有圈栏。三，防治与消灭病虫害。四，推广优良品种。五，推广新式农具。除充分利用现有双轮双铧犁等新式农具外，还适当推广圆盘耙、十行播种机，摇臂收割机等新式农具。并计划建立二处机器拖拉机站。六，繁殖牲畜。全县耕牛由1957年的四万四千多头增加到九万多头。七，植树造林。全县现在尚需绿化面积六十七万多亩，在五年内平均每年完成十三万多亩。八，发展副业生产。1962年生猪发展到六十万头，平均每户将养猪三头。
    到会的干部，现都认真地学习和讨论全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）和本县五年农业发展纲要（草案）。在讨论中，经过认真的分析和算账，大家都有充分的信心，保证五年内完成县委在规划中所提出的要求。同时，大家还根据县委的规划，结合本地情况，订出本区、本乡、本社的规划。在粮食产量指标上，许多乡、社订的指标，都超过县委提出的指标5％。到会的干部信心都很高，一致表示有决心完成县委在农业发展规划中所提出的任务。
