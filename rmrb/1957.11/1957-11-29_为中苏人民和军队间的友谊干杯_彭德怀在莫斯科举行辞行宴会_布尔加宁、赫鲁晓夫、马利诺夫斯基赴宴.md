Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 28th—Marshal Peng Dehuai, head of the Chinese military goodwill delegation to the Soviet Union, held a farewell banquet at the "Beijing Restaurant" in Moscow on the evening of the 27th.

Invited to the banquet were Soviet Communist Party and government leaders Bulganin and Khrushchev, Soviet Defense Minister Marshal Malinovsky, Soviet Marshals Sokolovsky, Meretskov, and Bagramyan, Air Force Chief Marshal Zhigarev, Air Force Marshals Vershinin and Rudenko, Artillery Marshals Varentsov, Nedelin, and Yakovlev, Generals Malinin, Antonov, Zhadov, and Kurasov, Admiral Flota Vlasov, as well as more than one hundred generals and officers.

Soviet Minister of Defense Industry Ustinov and Deputy Foreign Minister Fedrin were also invited to the banquet.

The entire members of the Chinese military goodwill delegation to the Soviet Union, Chinese Ambassador to the Soviet Union Liu Xiao, and Military Attaché of the Embassy, Lieutenant General Han Zhenji, attended the banquet.

Marshal Peng Dehuai delivered a speech at the banquet. He first expressed his gratitude for the hospitality the delegation received in the Soviet Union. He said that during the more than twenty days of the visit, the heroic Soviet army left us with an extremely deep impression. The Soviet army is an army equipped with the latest modern technology, with good military training and a high degree of patriotism and internationalism. This is a great achievement under the leadership of the Soviet Communist Party. The Soviet army is a powerful force defending world peace and the cause of socialist construction, and is also a good example for the Chinese People's Liberation Army. We will certainly bring back what we have learned from this visit to our country, study it carefully, and apply it according to the actual situation of the Chinese army.

Peng Dehuai then said that the Chinese military goodwill delegation to the Soviet Union was warmly received by comrades in Moscow and various places. The Soviet people and the Soviet army treated us as their own brothers. The fact once again proves that the friendship between the people and armies of China and the Soviet Union has not only a deep foundation among leading comrades and ordinary cadres, but also a deep foundation among the broad masses of the people and army soldiers. This deep friendship will last forever, and no force can separate us.

Peng Dehuai said that in order to thank the Soviet army for its warm reception of our visit and further enhance the unity of the Chinese and Soviet armies, we warmly invite Comrade Marshal Malinovsky and the Soviet military delegation to pay a friendly visit to China.

Then, Marshal Malinovsky spoke.

He said that the armed forces of the Soviet Union and China are defending the peaceful and creative labor of our two peoples. The strength of our army lies not only in the fact that they are equipped with modern first-class weapons, but first and foremost in the fact that they have flesh-and-blood ties with their own people, and their leaders and organizers are the Communist Parties of the Soviet Union and China. We are happy for the achievements made by the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

He said that the purpose of the increase in the power of our two countries' armed forces is to strengthen the cause of peace and socialism. We are very willing to provide our Chinese friends and military brothers with our experience in building armed forces. We sincerely wish the Chinese People's Liberation Army continued success in improving its combat effectiveness, so that the Chinese armed forces can ensure their national interests and, together with the armed forces of the entire socialist camp, defend peace and the security of all peoples.

Comrade Khrushchev also spoke at the banquet. The banquet proceeded in a comradely, sincere and friendly atmosphere. The hosts and guests constantly toasted the fighting friendship between the people and armies of China and the Soviet Union. (Picture attached)

    彭德怀元帅在宴会上致词。他首先对代表团在苏联所受到的招待表示感谢。他说，在二十多天的访问中，英雄的苏联军队给了我们极其深刻的印象。苏联军队是拥有最新现代技术装备、有着良好的军事训练和高度爱国主义、国际主义精神的军队。这是在苏联共产党领导下的伟大成果。苏联军队是保卫世界和平、保卫社会主义建设事业的强大力量，也是中国人民解放军的良好榜样。我们一定把这次访问所学到的东西带回国去，认真研究，根据中国军队的实际情况加以运用。
    彭德怀接着说，中国军事友好访苏代表团在莫斯科和各地都受到同志们的热情接待。苏联人民和苏联军队都把我们当作自己的兄弟。事实再一次证明：中苏两国人民和军队之间的友谊不但在领导同志和一般干部当中已经有了深厚的基础，而且在广大人民群众和军队士兵当中也有了深厚的基础。这种深厚的友谊将永世长存，任何力量都不能够把我们拆散。

    他说，我们两国武装力量的威力的增长目的在于加强和平和社会主义的事业，我们非常愿意把我们建设武装力量的经验提供给我们的中国朋友们和军人弟兄们。我们衷心地祝中国人民解放军在提高战斗力方面继续取得成就，使中国的武装力量确保本国的国家利益，并且和整个社会主义阵营的武装力量一道保卫和平和各国人民的安全。
