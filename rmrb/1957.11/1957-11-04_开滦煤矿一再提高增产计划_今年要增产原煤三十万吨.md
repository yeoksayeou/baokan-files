    Kailuan Coal Mine Continues to Raise Production Increase Plan
    This Year to Increase Raw Coal Production by 300,000 Tons
    (Our Newspaper) News: The workers of Kailuan Coal Mine have increased their planned production increase of raw coal this year from the original 150,000 tons and 200,000 tons to the current 300,000 tons. In February of this year, their planned annual production increase of raw coal was set at 150,000 tons. By the end of May, in addition to completing the state plan on a monthly basis, they had cumulatively increased raw coal production by more than 140,000 tons. Therefore, they revised the annual planned production increase of raw coal to 200,000 tons. By August 7th, in addition to completing the state plan every day, they had cumulatively increased raw coal production by 200,000 tons. By the end of September, they had cumulatively completed a production increase of more than 246,000 tons of raw coal. This shows that Kailuan Coal Mine still has certain potential. Recently, with the help of Vice Minister Liu of the Ministry of Coal Industry and Soviet experts, they studied the plan for increasing raw coal production and preparing for next year's production. They believe that the annual planned production increase of raw coal can be increased to 300,000 tons, and that work such as strengthening the tunneling of roadways, fire and water prevention, and machinery repair in the production preparation work can be completed on time and according to quality standards.
    The state plan for Kailuan Coal Mine to produce raw coal this year is higher than last year's actual production. Because the mine's leadership has strengthened political and ideological work and improved production management, the workers' production enthusiasm is high, so the production tasks are completed relatively well. In terms of political and ideological work, following the response to the State Council's call to increase coal production during the Spring Festival, the mine leadership has continuously adopted various forms, focusing on the workers' ideological situation, repeatedly explaining the state and enterprise's financial situation to everyone, and conducting education on hard work, thrift in building the country, and carrying out the production increase and economy campaign, thereby improving the workers' ideological understanding. They also organized various forms of small-scale competitions, such as competitions between the previous shift and the next shift, between classes and groups or individuals with the same conditions, and inter-mine competitions in the same business and type of work, etc. This has continuously encouraged and organized the workers' production enthusiasm, and the attendance rate of production workers is usually over 90%. Currently, the rectification movement and socialist education movement in the enterprise, after the upsurge of "great鸣大放" (letting people speak out freely), has entered the rectification and improvement upsurge, and the workers' production enthusiasm is very full.
    In terms of production management, they have learned from past lessons, stepped up production preparation work, and strived to overfulfill the excavation plan for all roadways. By the end of September, the available mining period of the prepared coal mining faces had reached more than six months, which ensured the connection between mining and excavation. They have also actively promoted regular cyclic operations. The proportion of mining faces operating on a regular cycle was 53.41% in the second quarter and increased to 58.1% in the third quarter; the proportion of faces completing more than 25 cycles per month was 32.83% in the second quarter and 48.27% in the third quarter.
    The safety situation in this mine's production has also improved compared to last year.
    However, most units in this mine have not fully utilized coal mining machinery. The reasons why coal mining machinery cannot be fully utilized, in addition to being affected by geological conditions, are mainly insufficient mechanical parts and insufficient repair capacity, and some grassroots cadres lack confidence and determination in using machinery. Only by seriously solving these problems can we better tap into this part of production potential.

### 开滦煤矿一再提高增产计划  今年要增产原煤三十万吨

    开滦煤矿一再提高增产计划
    今年要增产原煤三十万吨
    本报讯　开滦煤矿的职工们已经把他们今年增产原煤的计划，从原来的十五万吨、二十万吨提高到现在的三十万吨。今年2月，他们定的全年增产原煤计划是十五万吨，到5月底，除按月完成国家计划外，累计即已增产了十四万吨多原煤。于是，他们把全年增产原煤的计划改定为二十万吨。到8月7日，他们除逐日完成国家计划以外，累计又已增产了二十万吨原煤，到9月底为止，他们已累计完成增产计划二十四万六千多吨原煤。这说明开滦煤矿还有一定的潜力，最近在煤炭工业部刘副部长和苏联专家的帮助下，研究了增产原煤和作好明年生产准备工作的计划，认为全年增产原煤的计划可以提高到三十万吨。且能将生产准备工作中的加强掘进巷道推修、防火防水、机械修理等工作，按时按质的完成计划。
    开滦煤矿今年生产原煤的国家计划，是比去年的生产实绩提高了的。由于这个矿的领导方面加强了政治思想工作，改进了生产管理，职工们的生产情绪高涨，所以生产任务完成得比较好。在政治思想工作方面，继响应国务院关于春节期间增产煤炭的号召的工作以后，矿的领导上不断采取了各种形式，针对职工们的思想情况，反复向大家交代了国家和企业的家底，进行了艰苦奋斗、勤俭建国和开展增产节约运动的教育，提高了职工的思想认识。他们还组织了各种形式的小型竞赛，如上一班与下一班之间，同条件的班与班、组与组之间或个人之间的竞赛；矿际之间的同业务、同工种的竞赛；等等。这都不断鼓舞和组织了职工们的生产积极性，生产工人的出勤率平常总在90％以上。目前，企业里的整风和社会主义教育运动，在大鸣大放高潮之后，已进入整改高潮，职工们的生产情绪很饱满。
    在生产管理方面，他们接受了过去的教训，加紧了生产准备工作，努力超额完成全部巷道的掘进计划，到9月底，准备好的采煤掌子的可采期限已达到六个多月，这就保证了采掘的衔接。他们还积极推行了正规循环作业，回采工作面走上正规循环的比重，第二季度为53．41％，第三季度提高到58．1％；每月走二十五个以上循环的占全部工作面的比重，第二季度是32．83％，第三季度是48．27％。
    这个矿在生产中的安全情况也比去年有了改进。
    可是，这个矿的大部分单位对采煤机械还没有充分利用。采煤机械不能充分利用的原因，除受地质条件的影响外，主要是机械配件不足、修配能力不够，个别基层干部对使用机械的信心和决心不够。只有认真的解决这方面的问题，才能更好的发掘这部分生产的潜力。
