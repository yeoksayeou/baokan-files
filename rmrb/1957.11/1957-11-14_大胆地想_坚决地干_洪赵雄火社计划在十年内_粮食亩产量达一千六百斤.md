Dare to Think, Be Determined to Act
The Hongzhao Xionghuo Cooperative Plans to Achieve a Grain Yield of 1,600 Jin Per Mu Within Ten Years

    This newspaper, Hongzhao, 13th dispatch (Reporter Lü Jianzhong): The Xionghuo Agricultural Cooperative in Hongzhao County, Shanxi Province, recently adopted an inspiring ten-year production plan. This plan states that next year, the cooperative's average grain yield per mu will increase from 750 jin this year to 1,000 jin, and cotton will increase from 60 jin this year to 80 jin (seed cotton). By 1967, the grain yield per mu will reach 1,600 jin, and cotton will reach 160 jin. Coupled with diversified economic income, the cooperative's production level will exceed twice the production level of local well-to-do middle peasants.
    This plan was formulated after all members of the cooperative studied the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft), continued to freely express their views on production and construction issues, and conducted in-depth debates on the two roads. During the debate, conservative thinking, capitalist management ideas, and erroneous ideological tendencies such as being unthrifty, neglecting the interests of the state and the collective of the agricultural cooperative were criticized. This debate consolidated the ideological achievements of the previous stage of socialist debate among all members, especially the well-to-do middle peasants, and fully mobilized everyone's socialist enthusiasm towards achieving the goal of the cooperative's ten-year plan.
    During the airing of views and debates, everyone put forward more than 1,100 opinions and suggestions. Everyone believes that realizing the ten-year plan mainly relies on developing farmland irrigation, increasing fertilizer application, and improving farming techniques. Among the cooperative's 1,924 mu of cultivated land, in addition to strengthening the irrigation conditions of the original 1,300 mu of irrigated land, efforts should be made to fully irrigate all the cooperative's land within one or two years. The whole county will soon start the construction of the Fenhe Third Main Canal. After the cooperative realizes irrigation, it can not only silt the cooperative's nearly 1,000 mu of waterlogged land into good paddy fields, saving about 40,000 yuan in fertilizer investment each year, but also turn the original clear (spring) water irrigated land into irrigated land using both clear and flood water, and change from irrigating once every twenty days in the past to irrigating once every five to seven days. In addition, huge potential for increasing production can be tapped in aspects such as hydropower generation, labor management, manure accumulation, afforestation, animal husbandry, developing diversified economy, and improving agricultural technology. This debate greatly broadened the horizons of the cooperative members, overcame the idea of ​​"reaching the ceiling for increasing production", and made everyone dare to "dare to think, be determined to act". At the same time, some well-to-do middle peasants who still lingered on their own small-scale production methods were criticized again in the debate; when they realized that the above-mentioned measures to increase production could only be achieved through large-scale production methods, they sincerely expressed their intention to devote their hearts and efforts to the ten-year plan.
    In the debate, the debate on the management policy of the agricultural cooperative was also carried out on typical cases such as the cooperative's brick and tile kiln problem and the speculation and profiteering of cooperative members Zhang Zhijian, Liang Dongquan, etc., and their doing business themselves during the busy farming season, so that all cooperative members also received a practical education on the two roads in terms of management policy. Everyone firmly wants to adhere to the correct management policy of focusing on the development of agriculture, with sideline occupations as supplements, and not engaging in commercial activities to achieve the ten-year plan.
    On the above basis, everyone further debated what to rely on and who to rely on to achieve the ten-year plan. During the debate, everyone unanimously agreed that the policy of running the cooperative diligently and thriftily must be earnestly implemented. At the meeting, poor peasant Liang Shibao and well-to-do middle peasant Zhang Fucai and others introduced their experience in managing their families diligently and thriftily and working actively, and criticized the phenomena of extravagance and waste and lack of diligence and thrift in the agricultural cooperative and some people. Their opinions were warmly welcomed by all cooperative members, greatly promoted the righteous spirit of loving the country and the cooperative and taking pride in labor, and the morale of the masses was high. Everyone realized that the practical manifestation of loving the country and the cooperative is to rely on their own capital accumulation to realize the plan, and decided to pay off all past state loans and increase the public accumulation fund from 7% last year to 10%.
    Now, each production team is also conducting a heated challenge competition to realize the plan.

    大胆地想  坚决地干
    洪赵雄火社计划在十年内
    粮食亩产量达一千六百斤
    本报洪赵13日电　记者吕建中报道：山西省洪赵县雄火农业社最近通过了一个鼓舞人心的十年生产规划。这个规划标明，明年全社粮食平均亩产量将由今年的七百五十斤提高到一千斤，棉花由今年的六十斤提高到八十斤（皮棉）。到1967年，粮食亩产量将达到一千六百斤，棉花达到一百六十斤，加上多种经济收入，那时候全社的生产水平将超过当地富裕中农生产水平两倍。
    这个规划是全体社员学习了全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）之后，在生产建设问题上继续大鸣大放和深入开展两条道路大辩论之后制定的。辩论中对保守思想、资本主义经营思想以及那些不勤不俭、忽视国家和农业社集体利益的错误思想倾向进行了批判。这次辩论使全体社员尤其是富裕中农前一段社会主义辩论的思想成果巩固下来，并且把大家的社会主义积极性完全调动到实现全社的十年规划这个目标上来了。
    在鸣放、辩论中，大家提出了一千一百多条意见和建议。大家认为实现十年规划主要靠发展农田水利、增施肥料和提高耕作技术。全社一千九百二十四亩耕地中，除加强原有一千三百亩水地的灌溉条件外，要努力在一、二年内使全社土地全部水利化。全县在最近就动工修建汾河三干渠。全社实现水利化以后，不仅可以把社里的近千亩浸湿地淤漫成好稻田，每年节省约四万元的肥料投资，而且能变原有的清
  （泉）水浇地为清洪两用的水浇地，并由过去的二十天轮浇一次改为五至七天轮浇一次。此外，还可在水利发电、劳动管理、积肥、绿化、畜牧、发展多种经济、改进农业技术等方面挖掘出巨大的增产潜力。这次辩论，大大打开了社员的眼界，克服了“增产到顶”的思想，使大家敢于“大胆地想，坚决地干”。同时，仍然留恋自己的小生产方式的某些富裕中农，在辩论中再次受到批判；当他们认识到上述种种增产措施只有大生产方式才能做得到的时候，他们心悦诚服地表示要把心和力量都用到十年规划上来。
    在辩论中，还就社里的砖瓦窑问题和社员张志坚、梁东全等的投机倒把、在农忙时自己去做买卖等典型事例开展了农业社经营方针的辩论，使全体社员也在经营方针上受到一次两条道路的实际教育。大家坚决要坚持以发展农业为主、副业为辅、不进行商业活动的正确经营方针来实现十年规划。
    在上述基础上，大家又进一步辩论了依靠什么和依靠谁来实现十年规划。辩论中大家一致认为必须切实贯彻勤俭办社的方针。会上贫农梁石宝和富裕中农张福财等介绍自己勤俭持家，积极劳动的经验，并批评了农业社和某些人的铺张浪费、不勤不俭的现象。他们的意见受到全体社员的热烈欢迎，大大发扬了爱国爱社、劳动光荣的正气，群众情绪高昂。大家认识到爱国爱社的实际表现是依靠自己的资金积累来实现规划，决定全部还清过去的国家贷款，把公积金由去年的7％提高到10％。
    现在，各个生产队也为实现规划进行了热烈的挑战竞赛。
