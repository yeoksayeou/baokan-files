Dear Comrade Delegates! Dear Comrades! The delegation of the Government and Party of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea feels greatly honored to attend the celebration meeting of the Supreme Soviet of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in celebration of the 40th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution.

On the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution, which opened a new era in human history, please allow me, on behalf of the Korean Workers' Party, the Government of the Democratic People's of Korea, and the entire Korean people, to extend warm fraternal greetings to our closest friends, the Soviet people! (Applause)

Under the leadership of the glorious Communist Party founded by Lenin, the Soviet people, after heroic struggles, built the first socialist society without exploitation and oppression in human history, and transformed backward Russia into a great socialist power.

Today, the Soviet people are successfully implementing the historic resolutions of the 20th Congress of the CPSU and have achieved new and great successes in all fields of politics, economy, science, and culture. The Soviet Union, thoroughly implementing Lenin's foreign policy aimed at consolidating peace and friendship among all peoples, is playing an increasingly decisive role in further strengthening the unity of socialist countries, easing international tensions, and consolidating world peace.

All this proves the great superiority of the Soviet socialist system—the product of the October Revolution—and proves the wise leadership of the CPSU and its Central Committee.

The victory of the Great October Revolution pointed out the road to freedom and independence for the people of the Eastern countries groaning under colonial oppression, and aroused them to engage in the struggle for national liberation.

The Soviet Union crushed German fascism and Japanese militarism, saving the people of all countries from fascist enslavement, and opened up the road to national independence for the people of the East. Today, in Asia, there are the great 600 million Chinese people, and the people of Korea, Mongolia, and Vietnam, advancing side by side with the Soviet people along the road pointed out by the October Revolution.

Hundreds of millions of people in India, Indonesia, Burma, and other Asian countries have shaken off the shackles of colonialism and are building independent sovereign states.

The Korean people rejoice at the achievements of the Soviet people in socialist and communist construction as if they were their own, and regard the powerful development of the Soviet Union as the source of their invincible strength.

In the darkest years of Japanese colonial rule, the victory of the October Revolution and the socialist construction of the Soviet Union gave the Korean people hope for liberation and gave them infinite encouragement in their struggle for national liberation.

The great Soviet Union liberated the Korean people from Japanese colonial rule and helped them build a new life materially and morally.

After liberation, the Korean people experienced countless difficulties and severe tests in the struggle for the unification of the motherland and national independence. In this arduous struggle, the Korean people always relied on the Soviet Union. With the active support and encouragement of the Soviet Union, the Korean people have gloriously withstood all difficulties and tests. With the support of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other people's democratic countries, the Korean people, together with their People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, defeated the armed aggression of the US imperialists and the Syngman Rhee clique, and defended the honor and independence of our motherland. In the post-war years, thanks to the enormous economic and technical assistance given by the fraternal countries and the correct leadership of the Korean Workers' Party, the Korean people have made tremendous achievements in restoring and developing the national economy. Industrial and agricultural production has increased rapidly and greatly exceeded pre-war levels, the people's living standards have improved, and socialist economic forms have achieved a decisive victory in all areas of the economy.

Now, under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party, the Korean people are confidently advancing along the road of peaceful reunification of the motherland and the victory of socialism in our country. (Applause)

Workers, peasants, intellectuals, and all the people of our country, based on the serious experience of their own struggles, are very clear about the great significance of solidarity with the people of the socialist camp, and above all, the unbreakable friendship with the great Soviet people.

The Korean people are proud that they are building their new life; that they have formed an alliance with such reliable friends as the Soviet people, and that they are a member of the powerful socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. The Korean people will always advance together with the Soviet people and will always be consistently loyal to the banner of proletarian internationalism. (Applause)

The enemies of peace and socialism, headed by the United States, are doing everything possible to undermine the unity of the socialist camp and to restore and support the moribund imperialist colonial system. Recently, the US aggressive bloc has attempted to provoke adventurous wars in the Middle East to oppose the national independence of the Arab countries, seriously threatening world peace.

The US imperialists continue to occupy the southern part of our country and have not ceased to carry out all kinds of subversive and destructive activities against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, attempting to create new tensions in Korea.

However, all the aggressive plots of the imperialists are countered by the powerful socialist camp closely united around the Soviet Union, and are met with strong resistance from the people of all countries pursuing peace and national independence. These plots are doomed to failure.

The Korean people, led by the Marxist-Leninist Party, relying on the active support of the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union, are unwavering in striving for the complete victory in their just struggle. (Applause)

Long live the 40th anniversary of the Great Socialist October Revolution! (Applause)

Long live the great Soviet people, the Communist Part of the Soviet Union, and its Leninist Central Committee! (Applause)

Long live the indestructible unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union! (Applause)

Long live the eternal and unbreakable friendship and unity between the Korean and Soviet peoples! (Prolonged applause)

    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表团团长
    金日成同志的讲话
    亲爱的代表同志们！亲爱的同志们！朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府和党的代表团能以出席苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟最高苏维埃为庆祝伟大十月社会主义革命四十周年所举行的庆祝大会，感到莫大的荣幸。
    值此庆祝开辟人类历史新纪元的伟大十月社会主义革命四十周年之际，请允许我代表朝鲜劳动党、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府和全体朝鲜人民，向我们最亲密的朋友——苏联人民致以热烈的兄弟般的敬礼。（掌声）
    苏联人民在列宁所缔造的光荣的共产党领导下，经过英勇奋斗，第一次在人类历史上建成了没有剥削和压迫的社会主义社会，把落后的俄国变成了伟大的社会主义强国。
    今天，苏联人民在顺利地实现苏共第二十次代表大会的历史性决议中，在政治、经济、科学和文化的一切领域里取得了新的巨大成就。彻底执行旨在巩固和平和各国人民友好的列宁的对外政策的苏联，在进一步加强社会主义国家的团结、缓和国际紧张局势和巩固世界和平中日益起着决定性的作用。
    这一切都证明苏维埃社会主义制度——十月革命的产儿——具有巨大的优越性，证明苏共及其中央委员会的领导是英明的。
    伟大的十月革命的胜利，向呻吟在殖民压迫下的东方各国人民指出了走向自由和独立的道路，并且唤起他们从事民族解放的斗争。
    苏联粉碎了德国法西斯和日本军国主义，使世界各国人民免遭法西斯的奴役，并为东方各国人民开辟了走向民族独立的道路。今天在亚洲有伟大的六亿中国人民，朝鲜、蒙古和越南各国的人民，在同苏联人民并肩携手沿着十月革命所指的道路前进。
    印度、印度尼西亚、缅甸及其它亚洲国家的亿万人民，挣脱了殖民主义的枷锁，建设着独立的主权国家。
    朝鲜人民对苏联人民在社会主义和共产主义建设中取得的成就，就像对自己的成就一样欢欣鼓舞，并且把苏联的强大发展看成是自己不可战胜的力量的源泉。
    在日本殖民统治的最黑暗的年代里，十月革命的胜利和苏联的社会主义建设，给了朝鲜人民以解放的希望，并且使他们在民族解放斗争中得到了无限的鼓舞。
    伟大的苏联把朝鲜人民从日本殖民统治下解放出来，并且从物质上和道义上帮助他们建设新生活。
    解放后，朝鲜人民在争取祖国统一和民族独立的斗争中，经历了无数的困难和严重的考验。在这艰巨的斗争中，朝鲜人民总是依靠着苏联。朝鲜人民在苏联积极支援和鼓舞下，光荣地经受了一切的困难和考验。在苏联、中华人民共和国及其它人民民主国家的支援下，朝鲜人民及其人民军和中国人民志愿军并肩作战，击退了美帝国主义者及李承晚集团的武装进犯，捍卫了我们祖国的荣誉和独立。在战后年代里，由于兄弟国家在经济和技术上给了巨大的援助，由于朝鲜劳动党的正确领导，朝鲜人民在恢复和发展国民经济中取得了巨大的成就。工农业生产迅速增加，并大大超过了战前水平，人民生活有了改善，社会主义经济形式在经济的一切领域内都取得了决定性的胜利。
    现在，朝鲜人民在朝鲜劳动党领导下，满怀信心地沿着和平统一祖国和社会主义在我国胜利的道路前进。（掌声）
    工人、农民、知识分子，以及我国全体人民，根据切身的严重斗争经验，十分清楚同社会主义阵营各国人民团结一致，而首先是同伟大苏联人民的牢不可破的友谊，对于他们有何等重大的意义。
    朝鲜人民引为自豪的是：他们在建设自己的新生活；他们同苏联人民这样可靠的朋友结成联盟，并且是以苏联为首的强大社会主义阵营的一个成员。朝鲜人民将永远同苏联人民一道前进，并且始终一贯地忠于无产阶级国际主义的旗帜。（掌声）
    以美国为首的和平和社会主义的敌人，千方百计地企图破坏社会主义阵营的团结，恢复和支持日暮途穷的帝国主义殖民制度。近来，美国的侵略集团企图在中近东地区挑起冒险的战争，以反对阿拉伯各国人民的民族独立，严重地威胁世界和平。
    美国帝国主义者继续占领着我们祖国的南部，仍未停止对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国采取一切方式的颠覆和破坏活动，企图以此在朝鲜制造新的紧张局势。
    但是，帝国主义者的一切侵略阴谋都遭到紧密团结在苏联周围的强大社会主义阵营方面的反击，并遇到追求和平和民族独立的各国人民的强大的反抗。这些阴谋注定破产了。
    由马克思列宁主义党所领导的朝鲜人民，依靠以苏联为首的社会主义各国的积极支援，坚定不移地争取自己的正义斗争的彻底胜利。
  （掌声）
    伟大的十月社会主义革命四十周年万岁！（掌声）
    伟大的苏联人民、苏联共产党及其列宁主义的中央委员会万岁！
  （掌声）
    以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的不可战胜的团结万岁！（掌声）
    朝苏两国人民的永恒和牢不可破的友谊和团结万岁！（长时间的掌声）
