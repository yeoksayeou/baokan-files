    Actively Increase Coal Production, Vigorously Conserve Coal!
    The coal supply falling short of demand is a serious phenomenon at present. Its impact will not only limit the development of industrial sectors such as metallurgy, electricity, and chemicals and the transportation industry, which use large amounts of coal, but also affect the fuel supply for people's livelihoods. To solve this problem, we must resolutely implement the Party Central Committee and the State Council's instructions on increasing production and practicing economy. On the one hand, national and local state-owned coal mines should exert all positive factors, continue to tap production potential, and strive to increase coal production as much as possible. On the other hand, industrial, transportation, and other sectors, as well as government agencies, schools, the military, and urban and rural residents across the country should, based on the principle of running enterprises and undertakings diligently and thriftily and managing households diligently and thriftily, take various measures to vigorously conserve coal. Only by simultaneously increasing coal production and conserving coal can the tense coal supply situation be alleviated.
    In recent years, the development speed of China's coal industry has surpassed any period in history. Before liberation, China's highest annual coal output was 61.87 million tons; this level was surpassed as early as 1952. According to the First Five-Year Plan, coal production would increase by an average of 12% annually, reaching an annual output of 113 million tons by 1957. This plan has also been completed ahead of schedule. It is estimated that the national coal output in 1957 will reach 120.16 million tons, 106.5% of the Five-Year Plan, with an average annual increase of 13.6%, 1.6% higher than the annual increase rate stipulated in the Five-Year Plan. It can be seen that the development speed of the coal industry is very fast, the achievements of the coal industry during the First Five-Year Plan are significant, and the comrades in the coal industry departments have made great efforts.
    So, why is there still a situation where the coal supply falls short of demand?
    The problem is that the development speed of the entire national economy during the same period is faster than the development speed of the coal industry. The First Five-Year Plan stipulated that the total industrial output value should increase by an average of 14.7% annually, and the actual implementation resulted in an average annual growth rate of 17.4%. As the development speed of the entire industry accelerated, the demand for coal also increased. In 1952, the total national coal consumption for production and operation, including industry, transportation, and local handicrafts, was 32 million tons. In 1957, it is estimated that it will reach 69.6 million tons, with an average annual increase of 16.8%. This means that the national coal consumption for production and operation will increase by an average of 7.5 million tons each year. This is a considerable figure.
    In addition to the increased demand for coal for production and operation, the demand for civilian coal has also increased. At present, the amount of civilian coal in our country accounts for about 40% of the total coal sales. Because our country has little land, a large population, and few forests, coal is the main fuel in some rural areas, especially in economic crop areas. Especially after agricultural cooperativization, various places have universally carried out farmland water conservancy construction, fertilizer accumulation, soil and water conservation, and expansion of economic and technical crop areas. The firewood, which used to be the main fuel in rural areas, has relatively decreased, and the demand for civilian coal has further increased. In 1952, the national amount of civilian coal was 24 million tons. In 1957, it is estimated to be 52.45 million tons, with an average annual increase of 16.9%. This means that the national amount of civilian coal will increase by an average of 5.7 million tons each year. This is also a considerable figure.
    Adding the needs of other aspects, the national coal demand in 1957 greatly exceeded the original consumption amount set by the Five-Year Plan. Although the coal industry departments completed the output stipulated in the First Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule and exceeded the target, they still cannot meet the needs of industrial and transportation coal and civilian coal. This is the entire situation of the coal supply falling short of demand, and it is a new problem brought about by the rapid development of the national economy.
    Is it possible to increase coal production? It is entirely possible. The production potential of coal mining enterprises is multifaceted. The most prominent weak links at present are lax labor discipline, low attendance rates, poor production preparation, and frequent accidents. The reason why these situations occur is inseparable from weak political and ideological work and poor production management. For example, due to poor management, especially the poor political and ideological work, the phenomenon of a small number of employees being absent from work is still noteworthy. From January to August this year, the average attendance rate of workers producing raw coal in the coal department system was only 87.6%, a decrease of 2.29% compared with the same period last year. It is impossible to require a 100% attendance rate, but maintaining the level that has already been reached last year is a completely reasonable requirement. If the level that has already been reached last year is achieved, more than one million tons of coal can be produced for the country. What's more, can't our attendance rate be greatly improved compared with last year? For another example, due to poor production preparation, only 92% of tunnel excavation was completed from January to August this year, and even more seriously, only 84% of the main tunnels were completed, which not only affects the current production but also brings some difficulties to next year's production. Furthermore, there are still many accidents in coal mines this year. According to estimates, 930,000 tons of coal were lost in the first half of the year alone due to accidents. Of course, it is difficult to completely eliminate accidents. The phenomenon of reduced coal production due to accidents will always exist, but can fewer accidents occur and less impact on output? Obviously, this is entirely possible. Due to the above-mentioned reasons, among the 138 enterprises under the Coal Industry Department in the first half of this year, 44 enterprises failed to complete the plan. Of course, some enterprises' underproduction has certain objective difficulties, but are so many enterprises' underproduction all unavoidable? Obviously not. Most enterprises can completely exceed the national plan as long as they improve their work.
    The rectification and socialist education movement currently being carried out in industrial and mining enterprises across the country has created an excellent condition for overcoming shortcomings, improving work, and tapping production potential. With the development of this movement, righteousness is rising, evil is declining, the phenomenon of lax labor discipline has been corrected, and a new production upsurge is forming. Taking the average daily output of state-owned coal mines as an example, it was 250,900 tons in July, 259,100 tons in August, and 276,900 tons in September. The situation in some units that have been relatively backward for a long time has also improved significantly. The Datong Coal Mine is a unit that has been relatively backward in its work for a long time. It did not complete the national plan last year and lacked confidence in completing the Five-Year Plan. However, under the leadership of the Party, it vigorously carried out socialist education. After fully mobilizing the masses, adjusting labor organization, rectifying labor discipline, and at the same time, strictly handling a small number of rogues, hooligans, thieves, and other bad elements and anti-socialist elements who seriously violated laws and discipline and refused to be reformed after repeated education, its work in the recent period has greatly improved. The overall daily output has increased from 11,000 to 12,000 tons in the past to the current more than 20,000 tons, and it is already confident of exceeding the First Five-Year Plan. The Taiyuan Xishan Mining Bureau adopted the same method, increasing the attendance rate from 84.85% in the first quarter to 89.3% in September, and has proposed to exceed this year's national plan by 20%. These vivid examples prove that all coal mining enterprises will surely be able to make the leadership work and the appearance of the enterprise completely new as long as they earnestly carry out the rectification and socialist education movement, and the prospects for increasing coal production are infinitely broad.
    It must be especially emphasized that while actively increasing coal production, we must pay attention to improving quality, and we must also pay attention to safety, strengthen equipment maintenance, and production preparation. Combining increasing coal production with paying attention to safety, paying attention to quality, and strengthening equipment maintenance and production preparation is a normal requirement of coal mine production, not an additional requirement. All coal mining enterprises must fully recognize this point.
    In addition to the active increase in production by state-owned coal mines, local coal mines should also shoulder the task of increasing coal production. In 1957, the output of local coal mines was equivalent to one-quarter of the national coal output, which played an important role in supplying coal for civilian use and small and medium-sized city handicrafts. Especially after the State Council issued instructions on actively developing small coal kilns, the development of local coal mines and small coal kilns was rapid, and the output increased significantly. Strengthening the leadership of local coal mines and further developing local coal mines will play an important role in alleviating the contradiction between coal supply and demand. Provinces, cities, and autonomous regions should regularly understand and check the production, transportation, and commercial departments' acquisition of small kiln coal and provide specific assistance.
    The fundamental solution to the coal supply problem is to build new mines and greatly increase coal production. However, the construction of new wells requires a large amount of capital and a long time, and the problem cannot be completely solved in a short time. The most effective way to alleviate the current coal supply tension, in addition to striving to tap production potential and increase coal production, is to effectively conserve coal. Since the State Council issued instructions on conserving coal on January 6 this year, many regions and units have taken effective measures and have achieved some practical results. Thirteen provinces and cities, including Beijing, Shanghai, Liaoning, and Heilongjiang, saved 450,000 tons of coal in the first quarter, and the coal consumption quotas of various industrial sectors have also been reduced. However, from the national perspective, it is far from enough, and this work must be further deepened and comprehensively carried out.
    The potential for saving coal is also very large. According to surveys, there is a big difference in coal consumption between advanced and backward units in the industrial sector. Taking the power industry sector as an example, some power plants only need a little over a pound of coal to generate one kilowatt-hour of electricity, while some plants need about two pounds. According to experiments by the railway department, railway locomotives can save 12%-20% if they use sized coal instead of raw coal. This shows that in the industrial and transportation sectors, as long as the equipment is appropriately improved and coal burning technology is improved, the coal consumption quota can still be greatly reduced. According to a survey of 77 units in Beijing, 41 units used less coal than the national standard for heating, and the units that saved the most coal used 50% less than the national standard. Some government agencies used an average of two to three catties of coal per person per day for cooking, while the lowest average was only three to four taels per person, which can also be greatly saved. It is estimated that if the coal consumption quota of various industrial sectors can be reduced by another 3%, heating coal of government agencies and organizations can be saved by 15%, industrial coal supplied by the market can be saved by 5%, and residential coal can be saved by 5%, then 4 million to 5 million tons of coal can be saved in one year.
    In order to carry out the work of saving coal well, industrial and transportation departments, provinces, cities, agencies, schools, and the military across the country must take measures seriously, extensively carry out propaganda and education work on saving coal, promote various advanced experiences related to saving coal, improve some equipment of boilers, take measures such as supplying coal by variety, strengthen the planned management of coal use, strictly control consumption quotas, and urban and rural people should actively create experiences in saving coal burning and consciously help the country save resources. At present, winter has arrived, which is the season when urban and rural residents use the most coal. Government agencies, organizations, schools, and the military should appropriately postpone the heating time according to local climatic conditions. Coal supply falling short of demand is not only a prominent contradiction in the current economic work, but also a phenomenon that exists for a considerable period of time in the future. Therefore, only by simultaneously increasing coal production and conserving coal can this contradiction of coal supply falling short of demand be gradually and thoroughly resolved. As long as the national coal production and consumption departments can earnestly and conscientiously implement the "State Council's instructions on strengthening coal mine leadership, exerting production potential, increasing coal production and vigorously conserving coal," the current tight coal supply situation will surely be alleviated.

    积极增产煤炭，大力节约用煤！
    煤炭供不应求，是当前的一个严重现象。其影响所及，不仅将限制大量使用煤炭的冶金、电力、化学等工业部门和交通运输事业的发展，而且将影响人民生活的燃料供应。为了解决这个问题，必须坚决贯彻执行党中央和国务院增产节约的指示，一方面，全国国营和地方国营的煤矿应当发挥一切积极因素，继续挖掘生产潜力，尽最大可能地努力增产煤炭；另一方面，全国工业、交通运输业、机关、学校、部队和城乡居民应当根据勤俭办企业、事业和勤俭持家的原则，采取各种措施，大力节约煤炭。只有增产煤炭和节约用煤同时并举，煤炭供应的紧张情况，才能有所缓和。
    这几年来，我国煤炭工业的发展速度，是超过历史上任何时期的。解放前，我国煤炭最高年产量是六千一百八十七万吨；这个水平远在1952年就被突破了。按照第一个五年计划的规定，煤炭产量平均每年递增12％，到1957年要达到年产一亿一千三百万吨的水平。这个计划也已提前完成了。预计1957年全国煤炭产量可达到一亿二千零十六万吨，为五年计划的106．5％，平均每年递增13．6％，较五年计划规定的每年递增速度增长了1．6％。可见煤炭工业的发展速度是很快的，第一个五年计划煤炭工业的成绩是很大的，煤炭工业部门的职工同志们是做了很大努力的。
    那么，为什么还会出现煤炭供不应求的情况呢？
    问题在于，同一时期整个国民经济的发展速度更快于煤炭工业的发展速度。第一个五年计划规定全国工业总产值平均每年递增14．7％，实际执行的结果，平均每年发展速度达到17．4％。由于整个工业的发展速度加快了，煤炭需要量也增加了。1952年，包括工业、交通运输业和地方手工业在内的全国生产经营用煤共三千二百万吨，1957年预计将达到六千九百六十万吨，平均每年递增16．8％，这就是说，全国生产经营用煤平均每年要增加七百五十万吨。这是一个很可观的数字。
    除了生产经营用煤的需要量增加之外，民用煤的需要量也增加了。目前，我国民用煤的数量约占全部煤炭销售量的40％，因为我国地少、人多、森林少，在一部分农村，尤其是经济作物区，煤炭是主要燃料；特别是农业合作化之后，各地普遍开展兴修农田水利、积肥、水土保持以及扩大经济技术作物面积等工作，以前作为农村主要燃料的柴草相对减少，民用煤的需要量更形增大。1952年全国民用煤的数量为二千四百万吨，1957年预计为五千二百四十五万吨，平均每年递增16．9％，这就是说，全国民用煤的数量平均每年要增加五百七十万吨。这也是一个很可观的数字。
    加上其他方面的需要，1957年全国煤炭需要量较五年计划原定消费量超过很多，虽然煤炭工业部门提前超额完成了第一个五年计划规定的产量，但仍不能满足工业交通用煤和民用煤的需要。这就是煤炭供不应求的全部情况，是国民经济迅速发展中带来的新的问题。
    增产煤炭有没有可能呢？完全有这种可能。煤矿企业的生产潜力是多方面的。当前最突出的薄弱环节是劳动纪律松弛，出勤率低，生产准备工作差，事故多。而这些情况之所以产生，是和政治思想工作薄弱及生产管理不善分不开的。例如，由于管理不善，特别是政治思想工作做得较差，少数职工旷工缺勤的现象还是值得注意的，今年1至8月，煤炭部系统生产原煤的工人平均出勤率仅达到87．6％，比去年同期下降了2．29％。要求出勤率达到百分之百，这是不可能的，但是维持去年已经达到的水平，却是一个完全合理的要求。如果达到去年已经达到的水平，即可为国家多产一百多万吨煤炭。何况我们的出勤率还可以比去年大大地提高呢？又如：由于生产准备工作差，今年1至8月巷道掘进只完成计划的92％，更严重的是主要巷道只完成计划的84％，这不仅影响当前的生产，也会给明年生产带来一些困难。再说今年以来煤矿的事故仍然不少，据估计仅上半年由于事故影响，就少产煤炭九十三万吨。当然，事故很难完全消灭，由于事故影响而少产煤炭的现象总是会存在的，但是能不能少出一些事故，少影响一些产量呢？显然，这是完全可以做到的。由于上述种种原因，今年上半年煤炭工业部所属的一百三十八个企业中，就有四十四个企业没有完成计划。固然，有些企业欠产，是有某种客观困难的，可是，难道这么多的企业欠产，都是不可避免的吗？显然不是。多数企业，只要改善自己的工作，是完全可以超额完成国家计划的。
    目前全国工矿企业开展的整风和社会主义教育运动，给克服缺点、改进工作、挖掘生产潜力创造了一个绝好的条件。随着这个运动的开展，正气上升，邪气下降，劳动纪律松弛的现象得到纠正，一个新的生产高潮正在形成。拿国营煤矿的平均日产量来说，7月份为二十五万零九百吨，8月份为二十五万九千一百吨，9月份为二十七万六千九百吨。一些长期比较落后的单位，情况也有显著的好转，大同煤矿是一个长期以来工作比较落后的单位，去年没有完成国家计划，对完成五年计划也缺乏信心，但是在党的领导下，大力进行了社会主义教育，经过充分发动群众，调整劳动组织，整顿劳动纪律，同时对少数严重违法乱纪屡教不改的混入工人队伍中的流氓、阿飞、盗窃等坏分子和反社会主义分子进行了严肃的处理，因而，最近一个时期的工作大有起色，全局的日产量由过去的一万一、二千吨提高到目前的二万多吨，超额完成第一个五年计划已经有了把握。太原西山矿务局采取了同样的方法，使出勤率由第一季的84．85％提高到9月份的89．3％，已提出超额20％完成今年的国家计划。这些生动的例子证明：一切煤矿企业只要认真开展整风和社会主义教育运动，必然能使领导工作和企业的面貌焕然一新，增产煤炭的前景是无限广阔的。
    必须特别强调的是，在积极增产煤炭的同时，必须注意提高质量，并要注意安全，加强设备的检修工作和生产准备工作。把增产煤炭同注意安全，同注意质量，同加强设备检修工作和生产准备工作结合起来，是煤矿生产的正常要求，而不是什么附加的要求。一切煤矿企业都必须充分认识到这一点。
    除了国营煤矿积极增产以外，地方煤矿也应该担负起增产煤炭的任务。1957年地方煤矿的产量相当于全国煤炭产量的四分之一，在供应民用和中小城市手工业用煤方面起了重要的作用。特别是在国务院发布了关于积极发展小煤窑的指示以后，地方煤矿和小煤窑的发展很快，产量有了显著的提高。加强对地方煤矿的领导，进一步发展地方煤矿，对缓和煤炭供不应求的矛盾会有重要的作用。各省、市、自治区应该经常地了解和检查他们的生产、运输和商业部门对小窑煤的收购情况，给予具体的帮助。
    解决煤炭供应问题的根本办法是建设新的矿井，大量增加煤炭产量。但是建设新井需要大量的资金和较长的时间，短时间内是不能彻底解决问题的。当前缓和煤炭供应紧张情况的最有效办法，除了努力发掘生产潜力、增产煤炭以外，必须切实节约煤炭。自从今年1月6日国务院发出节约用煤的指示以后，很多地区和单位采取了有效措施，已经取得了一些实际效果，京、沪、辽、黑等十三个省、市第一季度就节省煤炭四十五万吨，各工业部门的耗煤定额也都有所降低。但是从全国看来还做得很不够，必须进一步深入全面的开展这一工作。
    节约用煤的潜力也是很大的，根据调查，在工业部门中先进单位与落后单位耗煤量差别很大。以电力工业部门为例，有的电厂每发一度电只需煤一斤多，有的厂却需要二斤左右。据铁道部门试验，铁路机车如果使用粒度煤比用原煤能节约12％—20％。这说明在工业、交通部门只要适当的改善设备，提高烧煤技术，耗煤定额还是可以大大降低的。机关烤火用煤根据北京市七十七个单位的调查，有四十一个单位用煤量低于国家标准，用煤最省的低于国家标准50％。机关伙食用煤有的每天每人平均二、三斤，而最低的平均每人只三、四两，也是可以大大节省的。估计如果各工业部门耗煤定额能再降低3％，机关团体烤火用煤能节约15％，由市场供应的工业用煤节约5％，居民生活用煤节约5％，一年就能节约煤炭四百到五百万吨。
    为了很好的开展节约用煤的工作，全国各工业交通运输部门，各省、市和机关、学校、部队必须认真采取措施，广泛地开展节约用煤的宣传教育工作，推广有关节约用煤的各种先进经验，改进锅炉的部分设备，采取分品种供应煤炭等措施，加强煤炭使用的计划管理工作，严格控制消费定额，城乡人民都应当积极创造节省烧煤的经验，自觉的帮助国家节约资源。目前冬季已到，正是城乡居民用煤量最多的季节，各机关、团体、学校、部队应根据各地的气候条件，适当地推迟烤火时间。煤炭供不应求不只是当前经济工作中一个突出的矛盾，而且是今后一个相当长的时期里存在的现象。因此，增产煤炭和节约煤炭同时并举才能逐步彻底解决煤炭供不应求的这个矛盾。只要全国煤炭的生产部门和消费部门能够切实认真地贯彻执行“国务院关于加强煤矿领导，发挥生产潜力，增产煤炭和大力节约用煤的指示”，目前煤炭供应的紧张局面是一定可以缓和下来的。
