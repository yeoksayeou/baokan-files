    Three Short Poems
    Heartfelt Words
    Jiang Shui

    Who says girls only run to the city?
    Who says girls don't love farmers?
    The girl was furious when she heard,
    And glanced under the gas lamp.
    There squatted a young man,
    Sticking his neck out, dazed,
    "What are you thinking about!"
    The girl cursed in her heart.
    "Why don't you stand up and argue?
    Just letting this rich peasant spout nonsense?"
    The girl's face flushed red with anxiety,
    And raised her hand to request a speech.
            (Written in Shuanghuaishu)
    At the Debate	Zhu Cheng
    He again and again
    Muttered:
    "Money has a day to be spent,
    People have a time to meet."
    Don't look at his bear-like appearance,
    His belly is full of bad intentions.
    Who does he want to meet after all?
    Don't relax, follow closely!
    Should it be
    He who bows his head to us and confesses,
    Or should it be us
    Who kneel to this landlord again?

    Meeting's End	Zhu Cheng
    The meeting is over,
    Some are in contemplation,
    Some are whispering,
    Some are continuing to debate.
    Tonight,
    Socialism
    On this land
    Has taken root a few inches deeper?
            (At Xiping Village, a suburb of Beijing)

    短诗三首
    心里话
    江水
    谁说姑娘直往城里跑？
    谁说姑娘不爱庄稼汉？
    姑娘听得直冒火，
    朝汽灯底下瞧一眼。
    那里蹲着个小伙子，
    支着脖子在发楞，
    “在想啥呀？你！”
    姑娘心里骂了一声。
    “你干吗不站起来辩？
    就听凭这富农瞎胡编？”
    姑娘急得脸一红，
    举起手要求发言。
            （写在双槐树）
    辩论会上	朱城
    他一次又一次
    嘟哝着说：
    “钱有花了之日，
    人有见面之时。”
    别瞧他那副熊像，
    一肚子尽是坏水。
    他到底想跟谁见面？
    别放松，紧跟着追！
    到底该是
    他向我们认罪低头，
    还是该我们
    再向这个地主下跪？
    散会	朱城
    会散了
    有人在沉思，
    有人在低语，
    有人在继续辩论。
    今夜
    社会主义
    在这块土地上
    又扎进了几寸深？
            （于京郊西平庄）
