Ode to October

    Take My Heart With You
    Cai Qijiao

The other side of the Tianshan Mountains is a place I yearn for. There are white birches standing quietly in the fields, and snowflakes dancing and falling gently from the sky, the earth as pure as a maiden's heart. There, the spires of the capital burn with a ruby-red star that never goes out in the wind, snow, and deep night. I have seen all this in my dreams many times, and I still feel a surge of passion when I wake up.... Long ago, that snow-covered country had already produced the most passionate poetry, nurturing the souls of our generation. Pushkin is a giant oak in the storm, every leaf singing an impassioned song. Lermontov is a soaring flame. Nekrasov, clouds of melancholy and anger. They were only predicting the future. Finally, the dawn of the October wind and snow arrived, and a team of warriors appeared in the vastness, led by the tall Mayakovsky, shouting a voice that shook the world, bringing us the rebirth of poetry. Ah, Russia, mother of freedom! Your era of fire and gunfire, your era of tilling the land with the hooves of warhorses, shook complacent Europe and awakened slumbering Asia. The beacon red flag on the Don land also shone on the streets of Guangzhou, and the sound of the guerrillas galloping across the Siberian snowfields echoed in the dense forests of Wuyi Mountain. At that time, the Chinese prophets fixed their eyes on the light of October, opening their own path from the darkness. At that time, a spirited poet stood on the bank of the Xiang River, contemplating the distant mountains and forests, the deepest wisdom like timely spring rain, the bravest flowers blooming for the first time in the mountains and forests. After thirty years of wind and rain, October appeared in China for the second time. Asia has undergone earth-shaking changes, and imperialism has been defeated like an avalanche. At this time, engineers from the Urals are teaching Chinese workers in front of the Anshan furnace how to transform ore into flying steel. At this time, the builders of the Lenin Canal came to the rocks of Sanmenxia, taking the lead in laying the foundation for the happiness of millions of farmers. Thirty years ago, the poet who pointed out the country, time has covered his forehead with dust, but the grand blueprint in his heart is even clearer, he stepped on the banks of the Yellow River, he splashed on the rapids of the Yangtze River, looking at the broken clouds of Kunlun, pointing to the white waves of the Pacific Ocean, the power of the people is about to overturn the river and the sea, and a more powerful march will appear on the earth again.... Look! In that vast space, a radiant man-made satellite marks the forty-year milestone of the Soviets. People all over the world are cheering and celebrating. The poet who led millions of troops across the rivers and mountains of China will once again bring China's congratulations, fly to the land I yearn for, and step onto the steps of Lenin's and Stalin's Mausoleum in the sun-drenched morning to pay tribute to the bravest people in the world. Before the plane takes off, let me hand my heart over to him to take away! Take it to a corner of Red Square, to the forest of flags and flowers, and then, like a drop of water, melt into the sea of people waving their arms and overflowing with smiles. ...

    把心交他带去
    蔡其矫在天山的那一边，是我倾心向往的地方。那里有静立原野的白桦，飞舞的雪花从天空轻轻飘落，大地纯洁如少女的心。那里，都城的尖塔燃烧着一颗宝石的红星，在风雪中，在深夜里从不熄灭。这一切我都在梦中屡次见过，醒来还感到一阵激情……。很久以前，那雪原的国度就已经产生了最热情的诗歌养育我们一代人的灵魂。普希金是暴风中巨大的橡树，每一片叶子都发出激昂的歌声。莱蒙托夫是冲天火焰。涅克拉索夫，忧郁和愤怒的云。他们还只是在预言未来。终于来到了十月风雪的黎明，茫茫中出现一队战士，带头的是高大的马雅可夫斯基，喊出震动世界的嗓音，给我们带来诗歌的再生。啊，俄罗斯，自由的母亲！你那火光与枪声的年代，你那以战阵马蹄耕耘的年代，震颤了耽于安逸的欧罗巴，也惊醒了沉睡的亚细亚。那顿河土地上的烽火红旗，也照耀在广州的街道，西伯利亚雪地飞驰的游击队蹄声一直响到武夷山的密林里。那时候，中国的先知眼睛注视十月的光从黑暗中开辟自己的路。那时候，湘江的岸上站立着一个英姿焕发的诗人面对远山层林思索，最深沉的智慧如适时的春雨，最勇敢的花在山林初放。经过三十年的风霜雨露，十月又第二次在中国出现。亚洲经历了翻天覆地，帝国主义败走如雪崩山倒。这时候，乌拉尔的工程师在鞍山炉前教导着中国工人怎样把矿石转变为飞翔的钢铁。这时候，列宁运河的建筑者来到三门峡的岩石上带头打下千万农民幸福的基础。三十年前那指点江山的诗人，时间在他额上覆盖风尘，而宏图在他心中则更加清晰，他踏看黄河两岸，他飞溅长江的急流，望着昆仑的断云，指着太平洋的白浪，人民的力量又要翻江倒海，大地又出现更强大的进军……。看吧！在那太空之中一颗光芒四射的人造新星，标志了苏维埃四十年的里程。全世界人民都在欢呼庆祝。那率领百万部队踏遍中华河山的诗人又将再次带着中国的祝贺，飞到我倾心向往的土地在阳光照耀的早晨登上列宁斯大林陵墓的台阶向世界上最英勇的人民致敬。趁飞机还没有启程，让我把心交他带去吧！带到那红场的一角，带到那旗帜和鲜花的森林，然后像一滴水一样溶入那飞扬着手臂和泛滥着微笑的人群的海里去吧。……
