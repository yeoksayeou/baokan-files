    Night, in a village...
    ...This is a quick sketch of a certain night in Xishan Township, a suburb of Beijing. Throughout the nation, in thousands upon thousands of villages, every night is spent in an extraordinary atmosphere. From this one village, you can hear the footsteps of socialism striding forward in the vast countryside.
    He Understood!
    -- A Debate in the Black Pagoda Brigade
    Dai Zeng was a well-known person in the village who never attended meetings. From the day of liberation until this debate, he had never attended a single meeting, no matter what it was.

    During the period of "Big Blooming, Big Airing of Views," the commune members went to Dai Zeng's house for two meetings. At that time, he had said, "My income decreased after joining the commune." This statement aroused great interest among the commune members, and everyone had their own views, which they discussed openly at the debate.

    Zhang Lao Han (Old Man Zhang) said, "We can divide Dai Zeng's life into three parts to see if his life is better or worse. Before liberation, he worked for others, and life was bad. After liberation, he got land, and life was better. After joining the commune, life became worse."

    Zhou Shuqin said, "That depends on how you look at it. After liberation, he got land, and the whole family worked in the fields. He also raised a few sheep, so of course, life was good. After collectivization, only two laborers from his thirteen-member family worked in the commune, so of course, the income was less. He still eats well every day, doesn't eat any coarse food, and even drinks some wine. How can he blame the commune? Who told him not to work?" She added, "A family like Dai Zeng's should have at least four laborers participating in the commune's labor. Three sons plus Dai Zeng himself. If each person earns only 2,500 work points a year, that's 10,000 work points a year. If one work point is worth 15 cents, that's an income of 1,500 yuan a year, or 125 yuan a month. For his family of thirteen, a living of ten yuan per person is very good in the countryside."

    Hou Yanshan said, "For those who say their income decreased after joining the commune, we should thoroughly calculate their attendance. Others work more than 300 days a year, but he only works half a year, spending the rest of his time on his private plot. Then he says his income decreased after joining the commune. I say for people like this, there's no way their income in the commune won't decrease."

    Dai Zeng's eldest son, Dai Guoliang, listened to everyone and thought they all made sense. He also spoke up, "My family has 1.8 *mu* of private land and has reclaimed more than 1 *mu* of wasteland around the house. My family puts all its energy into these lands. Who says it doesn't delay working for the commune? My family's life has indeed declined after joining the commune because we participate less in commune labor. I am personally willing to act in accordance with the commune regulations and hand over the excess private land to the commune."

    Huang Cheng said, "Dai Zeng's decreased living standard is self-inflicted. There are several laborers in the family, but only two participate in commune labor. Take Dai Guoliang, for example; he rested for forty days just for a wedding. If the whole family doesn't work, it's even more insufficient. Our lives have all improved after liberation. How many bicycles were there before liberation, and how many are there now? Without collectivization, our village would have beggars. These are all facts. Everyone may not say it, but they know it clearly in their hearts."

    At this point, Dai Zeng spoke, "I want to give up the private land and work in the commune, but my family has thirteen people. If we also only keep three *fen* of private land, how can that be enough! Two people eat one scallion, and thirteen people also eat one scallion. Is that reasonable or not?"

    Chen Guolu said, "The regulations for retaining private plots are not that rigid. If there aren't enough vegetables for so many people, you can buy them from the commune."

    Li Shuqin said, "In the past, one day of work wasn't even enough to eat for one day. After buying corn with the little money left over, there wasn't enough for vegetables. I couldn't even eat a meal of rice for half a year. After joining the commune, the family added a member, rice is eaten regularly, and we even added two quilts. My family of five is doing well without any private land."

    Chen Tingyuan said, "I don't think Dai Zeng's life has declined. You only think about selling vegetables from your private plot, which is wrong. Are you confused? Are you stupid? No. Grain doesn't fall from the sky. If several people in your family come out to work, I guarantee you can still save money. Everyone knows what my life was like in the past. What about now? After joining the commune, I have saved over a hundred yuan in the commune."

    Dai Zeng had nothing to say.

    The team leader announced the end of the meeting, and people walked out of the venue in a hubbub. Dai Zeng quietly walked to the team leader and the work team comrades and said:

    "Let's chat again; I have something to say."

    After everyone sat down, he said, "I am a rough fellow, and my thinking can change quickly. Everyone says my thinking has problems and that I am a stumbling block to socialism. I will not be a stumbling block. What everyone said is all correct. I will hand over the private land. From now on, I will not only participate in commune labor, but you watch, I will have to do the work of one and a half people."

    Before anyone could speak, he continued, "Since the Eighth Route Army came, I have never attended a meeting. The other day, you held two meetings at my house, and today I came here for another one. I understand now. I also want to speak at the meeting and tell everyone how I realized that keeping too much private land is unreasonable. Sigh, anyway, from now on, I guarantee I will attend every meeting."

### 他心里豁亮了——黑塔大队的一场辩论

    夜晚，在一个乡里……
    ……这里是北京郊区西山乡某一个夜晚的一些速写。全国有千百万个乡村，目前，每个乡村的每一个夜晚，都是在不平凡的气氛里度过的。从这一个乡里，你能听到社会主义在广大农村里大踏步迈进的足音。
    他心里豁亮了
    ——黑塔大队的一场辩论
    戴曾是村里有名的从不参加会的人，打从解放那一天起，直到这次大辩论以前，他无论什么会从没参加过一个。
    在大鸣大放中，社员们到戴曾家里去开了两次会。那时候，他曾经说过：“入社后收入降低了。”这句话引起了社员们的极大兴趣，大伙各有各的看法，在辩论会上便谈开了。
    张老汉说：“戴曾的生活好坏，可分三截，解放前他给人干活，生活就是不好；解放后他分了地，生活好了；入社以后生活坏了。”
    周淑琴说：“那要看怎么说，解放后他分得了地，一家子老小都到田里干活，家里还养几只羊，当然生活好。合作化以后，一家十三口人只出来两个劳动力到社里干活，收入当然少，他每天还净吃好的，不吃点粗的，还要喝点酒。这哪能赖社不好呢，谁让他不干活呢！”又说：“像戴曾家里起码有四个劳动力可以参加社里劳动，三个儿子加上戴曾本人，按一个人一年只挣二千五百分吧，一年就是一万分；按一分顶一角五分算，一年可以收入一千五百元，一个月就有一百二十五元，他家十三口人，一个人十来元的生活在农村就很好。”
    侯言山说：“说入社后收入减少的人，我们就该彻底算一下他的出勤。别人一年干三百多天，他只干半年，其余的时间都泡在自留地上，末了又说入社后收入减少了。我说这样的人，在社里的收入没有法子不减少。”
    戴曾的大儿子戴国良听听大伙的话都有道理，他也开了腔：“我家有一亩八分自留地，还在房子周围开了一亩多荒，我家的劲都使在这些地上了，谁说不耽误干社里的活呢？我家入社后生活降低，的确是参加社里劳动少，我个人愿意按社章办事，把多余的自留地交给社里。”
    黄成说：“戴曾的生活降低是自找的，家里有好几个劳动力只有两人参加社里劳动。就说戴国良吧，办个喜事一下子就歇了四十多天，如果一家人全不劳动那就更不够了。我们解放后的生活都提高了，解放前有多少自行车，现在有多少？不是合作化我们村会有要饭的，这都是实情。平时大家嘴里没说，心里可清楚。”
    这时戴曾说话了：“我要不留自留地就到社里干活去，可是我家十三口人，如果也只留三分自留地，那怎么成！两个人吃一棵大葱，十三口人也吃一棵大葱，这样做合理不合理？”
    陈国禄说：“按社章规定留自留地并不是那样死板的，如果人多菜不够吃还可以到社里去买。”
    李书琴说：“过去我干一天活还不够一天吃的，剩下些钱买了苞米就不够买菜的，半年也吃不上一顿大米饭。入了社家里添了一口人，大米饭常吃，还添了两床被，我五口人没要一分自留地也过得挺好。”
    陈廷元说：“我看戴曾的生活没有降低，你尽想靠自留地卖菜，这就不对。你糊涂吗？傻吗？不是的。粮食不能从天上掉下来，你家里几口人都出来劳动，保管你还能存钱。我过去的生活怎样大家都知道，现在呢，入了社在社里还存着百多元。”
    戴曾没话说了。
    大队长宣布散会，人们乱哄哄地走出会场。戴曾悄悄地走到队长和工作组同志身边，说：
    “咱们再聊聊吧，我还有些话。”
    等到大家坐下来，他就说：“我是大老粗，思想要变就变得快，大伙说我的思想有疙瘩，是走社会主义的绊脚石，我就不做绊脚石。大伙说的理都对。我要把自留地交出来，以后我不但参加社里劳动，你们看吧，我还得一个人抵一个半人干。”
    没等别人说话，他又接下去说：“从八路军来后，我从没有参加过会，前几天你们在我家里开了两次会，今天我又到这里开了一次，我的心里豁亮了，我还要在会上讲给大家听听，我是怎样认识多留自留地不合理的，咳，反正以后开会，我保证每次都到。”
