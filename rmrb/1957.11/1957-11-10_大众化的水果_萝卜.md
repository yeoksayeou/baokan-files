    Popular Fruit - Radish
    Radish is essentially a root vegetable. Among vegetables, its uses are broader than leafy greens. It can be stir-fried, served raw in salads, made into pickles, and even used as a substitute for fruit.

    In China, both southerners and northerners enjoy eating raw radishes to quench their thirst or "reduce internal heat." From a nutritional standpoint, it can completely replace fruit. First, it has a high water content. Second, radishes contain a large amount of Vitamin C. People generally eat fruit to supplement Vitamin C, and the nutrients contained in radishes, with the exception of carotene, have higher levels of other nutrients such as Vitamin C, riboflavin, niacin, calcium, phosphorus, and iron than oranges, apples, and pears. For example, one pound of "Xinlimei" radish contains 136 milligrams of Vitamin C, and one pound of small red radish contains 86 milligrams of Vitamin C, while one pound of apples only contains 20 milligrams of Vitamin C. Pears contain even less, only the Vitamin C content of citrus fruits can compare with radishes. One pound of oranges contains 93 milligrams of Vitamin C, and one pound of oranges contains 137 milligrams of Vitamin C. Third, radishes contain enzymes that can aid digestion, and they also contain mustard oil, which produces a pungent taste and promotes appetite. Therefore, from a nutritional point of view, radishes are only better than other fruits; from an economic point of view, the price of fruit is almost ten times more expensive than radishes.

    If the diet lacks Vitamin C, it can easily lead to symptoms such as listlessness, poor appetite, and easy bleeding of the teeth and under the skin. Infants also need a certain amount of Vitamin C every day, otherwise it will affect the growth of teeth and bones. Therefore, if we can often eat some raw radishes, we can supplement the lack of Vitamin C in our diet; infants can eat some boiled radish water or radish juice. (Zhu Lianzhen)

### 大众化的水果——萝卜

    大众化的水果——萝卜
    萝卜本是一种根茎类的蔬菜。在蔬菜中它的用途较叶菜类广，可以熟炒生拌，可以制咸菜，还可以代替水果。
    在我国，不论是南方人，还是北方人，都爱吃生萝卜以解渴或“去火”。从营养观点上来看，它完全可以代替水果。第一、水份多。第二、萝卜中含有大量的丙种维生素。一般人吃水果是为了补充丙种维生素，而萝卜中所含的营养素除胡萝卜素以外，其余的营养素如丙种维生素、核黄素、尼克酸、钙、磷、铁等，都比桔子、苹果、梨中的含量高。例如，一斤心里美萝卜中含丙种维生素一百三十六毫克，一斤小红萝卜中含丙种维生素八十六毫克，而一斤苹果中的丙种维生素只有二十毫克，梨中含得更少，只有柑桔类的丙种维生素含量才可以和萝卜相比。一斤桔子中含丙种维生素九十三毫克，一斤橙子中含丙种维生素一百三十七毫克。第三、萝卜中有一些酶可以帮助消化，并且其中含有产生辛辣味的芥子油，具有促进食欲的功效。所以从营养价值来看，萝卜和其它水果相比，只有过之而无不及；从经济观点来看，水果的价钱比萝卜几乎要贵到十几倍。
    如果膳内缺乏丙种维生素，就容易产生精神不振，胃口不佳，牙齿和皮下容易出血等现象。婴儿每日也需要一定量的丙种维生素，否则会影响牙齿和骨骼的生长。因此，我们若是能经常吃些生萝卜，就可以补足饮食中所不足的丙种维生素；婴儿则可吃些煮萝卜水或萝卜汁。　（朱莲珍）
