From Xuzhou, Huaiyin, and Yancheng Special Zones in Jiangsu Province, where natural disasters are frequent, the large-scale conversion of dry land to rice paddies has resulted in bumper harvests for two consecutive years. Last year, a total of 1.27 million mu of rice was planted, with an average yield of 240 jin per mu. This year, the area was expanded to over 1.36 million mu, and with the exception of a few areas, the average yield per mu in most paddy fields is around 215 jin. Many agricultural cooperatives have also achieved high yields of over 500 jin.

"Dry to wet" conversion is one of the main projects for reforming the cultivation system in Jiangsu Province and an important measure to change the impoverished situation in the three special zones of Xuzhou, Huaiyin, and Yancheng. In the past two years, the areas for "dry to wet" conversion were mainly on both sides of the main irrigation canal, along the Grand Canal, and in some low-lying lake and swamp areas. These lands were mostly newly reclaimed wasteland, fallow land, low-lying and flood-prone areas, and low-yielding dry grain land. The result of large-scale "dry to wet" conversion in the past two years is that the impoverished situation in these areas has begun to change: agricultural cooperatives have significantly increased grain production, public means of production have increased significantly, and many agricultural cooperatives have successively changed from grain-deficient to self-sufficient, and from self-sufficient to having surplus grain. In Guanyun County, the Xiaodang Agricultural Cooperative converted to rice planting this year, and the average income per member was 42 yuan, an increase of more than three times compared to last year. 23% of farming households built new houses, increased pig breeding by 23.27%, and increased the number of children enrolled in school by more than 50. In Binhai County, after the bumper harvest of rice planted in Luxiang and Tongyu townships, the lives of agricultural cooperative members have improved significantly, with 70% to 90% of the members catching up with or exceeding the living standards of the local wealthy middle peasants. The Liu Duna Agricultural Cooperative in Tongyu Township was originally a poor cooperative. Out of 342 households in the cooperative, 263 were poor peasants before the land reform, including 23 who begged for food in other places last year, and more than 200 were also "eating before saving" and living on debt. This year, the implementation of "dry to wet" conversion resulted in an average yield of 229 jin per mu, more than doubling the yield of dry grains and increasing the bumper harvest of 1955 by more than 370,000 jin. The entire cooperative of 1,498 people is expected to have an average net income of 52 yuan per person. Now this "poor cooperative" has 26 students in middle school and more than 210 in elementary school. Many folk songs praising "dry to wet" conversion are circulating among farmers in the converted areas. The people of Funing County sing: "Cooperativization, people stand up, the poor become rich; dry to wet, fields stand up, black soil becomes gold." (Attached picture)

    徐州淮阴盐城三个专区
    旱田改水田连年丰收
    本报讯　在江苏省自然灾害频多的徐州、淮阴、盐城等专区大面积的旱田改种的水稻，已经连续两年丰收。去年共种一百二十七万亩水稻，平均每亩产量二百四十斤；今年扩种一百三十六万余亩水稻，除少数地方外，大多数水田平均每亩产量都在二百一十五斤左右。不少的农业社还出现了五百斤以上的高额产量。
      “旱改水”是江苏省改革耕作制度的主要项目之一，也是改变徐、淮、盐三个专区的贫困面貌的重要措施之一。前两年“旱改水”的地区主要在灌溉总渠两岸、中运河一带和一部分湖荡洼地。这些土地大都是原来的新垦荒地、轮休地、低洼易涝地，以及低产的旱谷地。两年来实行大面积“旱改水”的结果，这些地区的贫困面貌开始有了变化：农业社粮食显著增产，公共生产资料显著增加，不少农业社并已先后由缺粮变为自给，由自给变为有余粮。灌云县小荡农业社今年改种了水稻，社员平均每人收入四十二元，比去年增加收入三倍以上，有23％农户盖了新房，增养猪子23．27％，增加入学儿童五十余人。滨海县路建、通榆等乡改种的水稻丰收后，农业社社员生活得到显著改善，70％到90％以上的社员赶上或超过了当地富裕中农的生活水平。通榆乡刘簖农业社原来是个穷社，全社三百四十二户，土地改革前有二百六十三户是贫农，其中有二十三户去年在外地讨饭，还有二百多户也是“前吃后空”，借债度日。今年实行“旱改水”，每亩平均产量二百二十九斤，比种旱谷增产一倍以上，比大丰收的1955年增产三十七万余斤。全社一千四百九十八人预计平均每人可得纯收入五十二元。现在这个“穷社”已有二十六个学生读中学，二百一十余人读小学。改制地区农民中流传着很多歌颂“旱改水”的歌谣。阜宁县群众歌唱：“合作化，人翻身，穷人变富人；旱改水，田翻身，黑土变黄金。”（附图片）
