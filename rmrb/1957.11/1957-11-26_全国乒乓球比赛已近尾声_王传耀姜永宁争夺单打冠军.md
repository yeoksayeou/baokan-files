    National Table Tennis Tournament Nearing Completion
    Wang Chuanyao and Jiang Yongning to Compete for Singles Championship

    (Our newspaper dispatch) The 1957 National Table Tennis Championships have entered the final stage. The elimination rounds for the four events of men's and women's singles and doubles, which started successively from the 23rd, have, by the 25th, left only two players (or pairs) to compete for the championship and runner-up.

    In the seventh round of the men's singles competition held on the 25th, Wang Chuanyao, Jiang Yongning, Zhuang Jiafu, and Liu Zhiwei secured the right to compete in the final four. Yang Ruihua of Shanghai Team A, who was considered highly likely to win the championship, led the first game against Zhuang Jiafu, but lost the next three games because he could not withstand Zhuang Jiafu's accelerated spin shots and suddenly changing drop shots, and was eliminated.

    In the eighth round, the match between Wang Chuanyao and Liu Zhiwei attracted all the spectators. Liu Zhiwei, who held the racket in his left hand, hit the ball on the left side with great force and speed, making it difficult for Wang Chuanyao to parry. Liu Zhiwei led 19-16 in the first game, but Wang Chuanyao took advantage of Liu's weakness of only being able to block on the right side, constantly hitting Liu's right side, forcing Liu to defend the right side with all his strength, exposing gaps on the left side, and then suddenly and quickly hitting the left side. He used this unexpected offensive method to tie the score at 20-20, and finally won the first game 23-21.

    In the second game, Liu Zhiwei attacked Wang Chuanyao's mid-court fiercely, and served many short, backspin balls, making it difficult for Wang Chuanyao to hit the ball, thus winning the second game. In the third game, Wang Chuanyao won by displaying his most powerful forehand and backhand smashes. In the fourth game, Wang Chuanyao led all the way, and with a 20-13 advantage, victory seemed within reach, but he was too cautious and dared not smash, allowing Liu to win six consecutive points to tie the score at 19-20, and finally won with a lucky net ball.

    In the match between Jiang Yongning and Zhuang Jiafu, because both sides were good at defending, neither of them easily smashed. When the score reached 16-12 and twenty minutes had passed, the referee judged that Jiang Yongning had won the first game. After that, Jiang won two more games in a row, eliminating Zhuang Jiafu 3-0. So far, only Wang Chuanyao and Jiang Yongning are left in the men's singles to compete for the championship.

    In the women's singles competition, after seven rounds of elimination, Zhang Baodi and Zhang Xiuying, who entered the top four, have been eliminated, leaving only Ye Peiqiong and Qiu Zhonghui to compete for the championship.

    Of the sixty pairs of male doubles players, after five rounds of competition over the past two days, only Wang Chuanyao, Hu Bingquan and Yang Ruihua, Xu Yinsheng are left to compete for the championship.

    Of the thirty-one pairs of female doubles players, after four rounds of elimination competition, only Ye Peiqiong, Qiu Zhonghui and Deng Zhujun, Li Linshu have qualified to compete for the championship. (An)

    全国乒乓球比赛已近尾声
    王传耀姜永宁争夺单打冠军
    本报讯　1957年全国乒乓球锦标赛已进入最后决赛阶段。从23日起陆续开始的男、女单打和双打四个项目的淘汰赛，至25日止都只留下争夺冠、亚军的两名（两对）。
    在25日进行的第七轮男子单打的比赛中，王传耀、姜永宁、庄家富、刘志伟四人取得了前四名的决赛权。被认为颇有希望染指冠军的上海一队的杨瑞华在对庄家富的比赛中曾一路领先赢了第一局，但在第二、三、四局的比赛中，杨因不敌庄家富削出的加速旋转球和突然改变路线的搓球，连输三局而被淘汰。
    在第八轮的比赛中，王传耀对刘志伟的比赛吸引了所有的观众。左手握拍的刘志伟在抽击左边的球时力猛球急，使王传耀颇难招架。刘志伟在第一局中曾以十九比十六领先，但王传耀利用刘右边不能进攻只能推挡的弱点，连抽刘的右边使刘全力防守右边球左边露出空隙时，突然疾抽左方，他用这种猝不及防的进攻方法，追成二十平，最后才以二十三比二十一取得第一局。
    第二局刘志伟猛攻王传耀的中路，在发球时放了不少短而下旋的球，使王传耀很难起拍抽击，因而赢得了第二局。第三局由于王传耀发挥了他最有威力的正、反手猛抽而取胜。第四局的比赛中，王传耀一路领先，以二十比十三的优势看来胜利在握，但因过分拘谨，不敢抽击，被刘连胜六分追至十九比二十，最后赖一下碰网球而取胜。
    姜永宁对庄家富的比赛由于双方都是守球好手，因此谁也不轻易抽击，当比数到十六比十二时由于已到了二十分钟，裁判判断姜永宁胜第一局。此后，姜又连胜两局，以三比零将庄家富淘汰。至此，男子单打只留下王传耀、姜永宁两人争夺冠军。
    女子单打比赛中，经过了七轮的淘汰赛，进入前四名的章宝娣和张秀英都已被淘汰，只留下叶佩琼和丘锺惠两人争夺冠军。
    男子双打比赛的六十对选手，经过两天来五轮的比赛，只留下王传耀、胡柄权和杨瑞华、徐寅生两对争赛冠军。
    女子双打比赛的三十一对选手，经过了四轮的淘汰比赛，获得争夺冠军权的只有叶佩琼、丘锺惠和邓竹君、李麟书两对。　（安）
