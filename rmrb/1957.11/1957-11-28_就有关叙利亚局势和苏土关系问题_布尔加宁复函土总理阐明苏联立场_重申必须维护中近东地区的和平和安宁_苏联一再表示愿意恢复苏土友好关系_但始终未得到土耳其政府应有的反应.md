Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 26th: TASS reported that the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Bulganin, wrote another letter to the Turkish Prime Minister Menderes on November 22nd. In the letter, he reiterated the Soviet Union's position on the Syrian situation and Soviet-Turkish relations, refuted some of the arguments made by Menderes in his reply, and expressed his willingness to use all available opportunities to improve Soviet-Turkish relations and ease tensions in the Middle East.

Bulganin wrote a letter to the Turkish Prime Minister on September 10th this year. The letter discussed the tension in the Middle East caused by the United States and Turkey's preparation for military intervention in Syria.

On September 30th, Menderes replied to Bulganin's letter through the Soviet Ambassador to Turkey. In his reply, Menderes addressed the situation in the Middle East and Soviet-Turkish relations. He attempted to defend the colonial powers' policies in the Middle East, as well as the pressure and threats used by the United States and Turkey against Syria. Menderes insisted that Syria's "armaments far exceeded what was needed for normal defense" and that Syria was becoming an "arsenal." The reply argued that the concentration of Turkish troops on the Syrian border was "a measure to safeguard its own national defense."

At the same time, Menderes's reply also guaranteed that Turkey never had, and never would have "the slightest intention of aggression" against its neighbors, and that Turkey was willing to "respect" the "independence and territorial integrity" of the Syrian people and all Arab countries.

In his reply, Menderes strongly defended the aggressive Baghdad Pact, attempting to prove its so-called "defensive" nature.

Regarding the issue of Soviet-Turkish relations, the Turkish Prime Minister also stated that the Turkish government was willing to restore the friendly relations based on mutual trust between the two neighboring countries, but he ingeniously put forward conditions for improving Soviet-Turkish relations. He proposed that the Soviet Union should abandon its policies in the Middle East.

On November 25th, the Soviet Ambassador to Turkey, Ryzhov, visited the Turkish Foreign Minister, Zoru, and handed him Bulganin's reply to Menderes.

In his letter, Bulganin pointed out that the Soviet government had carefully studied Menderes's reply of September 30th and had the opportunity to see the assurances expressed in the letter: that Turkey was willing to continue maintaining good neighborly relations with the Soviet Union and to transform these relations into the kind of friendly and trusting relations that had existed between the two countries in the past. The Soviet government was willing to confirm that the Soviet Union had the same desire towards Turkey. However, it was impossible not to notice that the situation surrounding Syria had greatly overshadowed the current Soviet-Turkish relations.

Bulganin then mentioned that the purpose of his last letter was to kindly advise the Turkish government to help prevent the Syrian situation from developing in an unpleasant direction, in order to maintain peace in the Middle East and universal peace, and not to participate in actions such as armed intervention in Syria, which would have extremely dangerous consequences. If Turkey listened in this matter to those foreigners who did not want to maintain peace in the Near East and only remembered to extract wealth from this region for profit, then Turkey would only bring great misfortune upon itself.

Bulganin said that the further development of events and the discussion of the Syrian issue at the current session of the United Nations General Assembly had fully confirmed that our concerns were justified. Many new facts proved that there was a military conspiracy against peace-loving Syria, the purpose of which was to deprive Syria of its national independence and make it obey the orders of certain other countries. The role played by the United States in all these machinations was also thoroughly exposed. The United States not only secretly instigated certain countries to invade Syria, but also shamelessly engaged in open provocation in this regard. The US government has used the Atlantic Treaty to threaten and sent the US Sixth Fleet to the eastern Mediterranean.

Bulganin pointed out that the Soviet Union sincerely hoped to establish the most friendly relations with Turkey. However, the Soviet Union was also equally sincere and eager to ensure that independent countries in the Middle East were free from armed aggression by anyone, and hoped that lasting peace and tranquility could be maintained in the region.

Bulganin said that the Soviet government had certainly noted the assurances made in your letter, in which you said that Turkey had no intention of aggression against its neighbors, that it was willing to respect Syria's independence and sovereign integrity, and that it had no intention of pursuing a policy of military adventurism. Of course, such assurances have a certain significance. However, when assessing the situation, the facts play a decisive role.

Bulganin said that, regrettably, the actual situation on the Turkish-Syrian border still contradicted these assurances. The many troops that Turkey had concentrated on the Syrian border had still not been withdrawn. Turkish troops were still making demonstrative movements on the Turkish-Syrian border. Recently, Turkish military aircraft had frequently violated Syrian airspace. Turkish troops often groundlessly invaded Syrian territory and strafed Syrian border outposts and settlements. Turkish officials and Turkish newspapers and radio stations under the control of the Turkish authorities continued to conduct hostile propaganda against Syria. Turkey's policy was nothing more than a dangerous game of playing with fire. All of this had nothing in common with Turkey's assurances of peaceful intentions towards Syria. The Turkish government should take into account that maintaining this dangerous state of tension in the region and blatantly attempting to continue exerting pressure on Syria would force countries concerned with ensuring lasting peace in the Middle East to take measures to effectively safeguard peace and tranquility in the region.

Bulganin pointed out that Menderes criticized the Soviet Union's Middle East policy in his letter, especially its policy towards Syria, and even believed that the foundation for restoring relations between Turkey and the Soviet Union could only be established if the Soviet Union abandoned this policy.

Bulganin said, we must first emphasize that the Soviet Union's policy towards the countries of the Middle East is in line with the principles of the Bandung Conference of Asian and African countries, which Turkey also agreed to. In this region, the Soviet Union has no, and does not want to have, economic or other privileges. The Soviet Union has not signed any secret treaties or secret agreements with any Arab country, including Syria. The Soviet Union is concerned with: the realization of peace in the Middle East, that the countries of this region have the possibility of living free and independent lives in accordance with their own national interests, and that no country interferes in their internal affairs.

Turkey often accuses the Soviet Union of selling weapons needed for self-defense to certain Arab countries. However, it should be known that in the 1920s, when the Turkish people, under the leadership of Kemal, were fighting for their independence and freedom, the Soviet Union also helped Turkey with weapons and ammunition. At that time, the Turkish people welcomed such help. Why does the Turkish government now oppose the Soviet Union giving the same selfless assistance to Arab countries? Moreover, these countries have not, and cannot, pose any threat to Turkey.

Bulganin said that the Soviet Union cherishes friendship with Turkey and approves of this friendship, but it is unwilling to exchange this friendship for abandoning support for the national independence of Eastern countries, especially the Arab East.

Bulganin asked: Does Turkey's participation in the current military conspiracy against Syria bring any benefits in international political relations? Have the meetings between Henderson in Ankara and Istanbul, the aggressive military demonstrations on the Turkish-Syrian border, and other such actions, not caused Turkey's moral prestige in the international arena to plummet? Have these actions not placed Turkey in an extremely difficult position in the East? It should be said that this is the case not only in the East, but also among all peace-loving countries.

Bulganin pointed out that after Turkey joined the North Atlantic military bloc and the Baghdad military bloc, it disregarded the national interests of other countries, disregarded its own future, and became extremely interested in the internal affairs of Arab countries, to the point that it seemed to be a representative of Western countries promoting colonialism in the East, and gradually acted in the name of these Western countries.

In his letter, Bulganin said, Mr. Prime Minister, you made accusations against Syria in your letter, saying that it is becoming an "arsenal." If one were to say which country in the Middle East is an arsenal, it would undoubtedly not be the peace-loving small country of Syria, but Turkey itself.

The Soviet government has stated, and considers it necessary to reiterate, that the Soviet Union has no territorial or other claims against Turkey, and that the Soviet Union's policy is entirely based on the principles put forward by Lenin of fully respecting the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of the Turkish state. We also believe that friendship between the Soviet Union and Turkey and joint efforts in consolidating peace and security in the Middle East countries would greatly contribute to establishing a stable and peaceful situation in this region, which would be of inestimable significance to universal peace. At the same time, the Soviet government does not want to worsen Turkey's relations with Western countries in order to improve Soviet-Turkish relations. Although the Soviet government takes a well-known and strong opposition to the North Atlantic Group and the Baghdad military treaty, it believes that Turkey's participation in these military groups will not become an insurmountable obstacle to improving the current Soviet-Turkish relations. On the contrary, the improvement of this relationship can make an important contribution to easing international tensions and strengthening the cause of security of both countries.

Bulganin pointed out that the Soviet government has repeatedly stated its willingness to restore the previous friendly and trusting relations between the Soviet Union and Turkey. In July of this year, the Soviet Ambassador to Ankara, entrusted by the Soviet government, made a formal proposal to the Turkish government, suggesting that the national leaders of the Soviet Union and Turkey establish direct contact in order to exchange views on the current state of Soviet-Turkish relations and discuss proposals that both sides may put forward with the aim of establishing sincere and truly good-neighborly relations between the two countries, including issues of economic cooperation.

Regrettably, our friendly proposition has not received the due response from the Turkish government, and the Turkish government has taken a very hesitant attitude towards any, even the smallest, measure aimed at improving relations between our two countries. From this, it can be seen that the Turkish government is implementing another line on this issue.

Bulganin concluded by saying that we believe that the Soviet Union's position on the Syrian situation and Soviet-Turkish relations has been clarified very clearly, and therefore there is no basis for any misunderstanding. On the other hand, in order to consolidate peace and seek mutual trust, we are still willing to use all available opportunities to improve Soviet-Turkish relations and ease tensions in the Middle East. We hope that the Turkish government will pay attention to the views expressed by the Soviet government above.

### 就有关叙利亚局势和苏土关系问题  布尔加宁复函土总理阐明苏联立场  重申必须维护中近东地区的和平和安宁  苏联一再表示愿意恢复苏土友好关系  但始终未得到土耳其政府应有的反应

    就有关叙利亚局势和苏土关系问题
    布尔加宁复函土总理阐明苏联立场
    重申必须维护中近东地区的和平和安宁
    苏联一再表示愿意恢复苏土友好关系
    但始终未得到土耳其政府应有的反应
    新华社27日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科26日讯：苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁11月22日再一次写信给土耳其总理曼德列斯。他在信中重申苏联在有关叙利亚局势和苏土关系问题上的立场，驳斥了曼德列斯在复信中所提出的一些论点，并且表示愿意利用现有的一切机会来改善苏土关系和缓和中近东的紧张局势。
    布尔加宁在今年9月10日曾经写了一封信给土耳其总理。这封信谈到美国和土耳其准备对叙利亚进行军事干涉在中近东造成的紧张局势。
      9月30日，曼德列斯通过苏联驻土耳其大使答复了布尔加宁的信。曼德列斯在回信中谈到中近东局势问题和苏土关系问题。他企图为殖民国家在中近东的政策以及美国、土耳其对叙利亚所使用的压力和威胁进行辩解。曼德列斯硬说叙利亚的“军备远远超过了正常防务所需”，硬说叙利亚正在变成“武器库”。回信辩解说，土耳其军队在叙利亚边境集结“是一种保障本国国防的措施”。
    与此同时，曼德列斯的回信还保证说，土耳其对它的邻国从来没有、将来也永远不会有“丝毫的侵略意图”，土耳其愿意“尊重”叙利亚人民以及所有阿拉伯国家的“独立和领土完整”。
    曼德列斯在回信中极力为侵略性的巴格达条约辩解，企图证明这个条约的所谓“防御”性质。
    谈到苏土关系问题时，这位土耳其总理虽然也说，土耳其政府愿意恢复苏土这两个邻国之间基于相互信任的友好关系，但是，他别出心裁地提出了改善苏土关系的条件。他提出，苏联应当放弃自己在中近东的政策。
  　11月25日，苏联驻土耳其大使雷若夫访问了土耳其外交部长佐鲁，把布尔加宁给曼德列斯的复信交给他。
    布尔加宁在信中指出，苏联政府仔细地研究了曼德列斯9月30日的复信并有机会看到信中所表示的保证：土耳其愿意与苏联继续保持善邻关系并且把这种关系变成两国之间以前有过的那种友好和信任的关系。苏联政府愿意证实苏联对土耳其也有同样的愿望。但是，不能不注意到，叙利亚周围的局势使目前的苏联和土耳其的关系大大地黯淡下来。
    布尔加宁接着提到他上次写信的目的就是友善地劝告土耳其政府协助防止叙利亚地区的事件朝不愉快的方向发展，以维护中近东和平以及普遍的和平，不要参与像武装干涉叙利亚那样的后果极其危险的勾当。如果土耳其在这件事情上听那些决不希望维护近东和平、而只念念不忘榨取这个地区的财富以谋暴利的外国人的话，那么土耳其只会替自己招来很大的不幸。
    布尔加宁说，事件的进一步发展以及本届联合国大会对叙利亚问题的讨论，完全证实了我们的担心是有根据的。很多新的事实证明，对爱好和平的叙利亚的军事阴谋是存在的，这种阴谋的目的，就是要剥夺叙利亚的民族独立，要它服从某些别的国家的命令。美国在这一切勾当中所起的作用也被彻底揭穿。美国不仅偷偷地唆使某些国家侵略叙利亚，而且还恬不知耻地在这方面公开地进行挑拨。美国政府曾经利用大西洋条约进行威胁，并把美国第六舰队派到地中海东部去。
    布尔加宁指出，苏联真诚地希望同土耳其建立最友好的关系。但是，苏联也同样真诚和热切地关怀着中近东独立国家不受任何人的武装侵略，希望这个地区的持久和平和安宁能够维持。
    布尔加宁说，苏联政府当然注意到了您的信中提出的保证，你们说土耳其没有侵略邻国的意图，它愿意尊重叙利亚的独立和主权完整，决没有执行军事冒险政策。当然，这种保证具有一定的意义。但是，在估计形势的时候，事实是起决定性作用的。
    布尔加宁说，遗憾的是，直到现在为止，土叙边境的实际情况还是跟这些保证相违背的。土耳其集结在叙利亚边境的许多军队仍然没有撤退。土耳其军队仍旧在土叙边境作示威性的调动。最近，土耳其军用飞机经常侵犯叙利亚领空。土耳其部队往往无端侵犯叙利亚国境并且扫射叙利亚的边防岗哨和居民点。土耳其的官方人士以及在土耳其当局势力控制下的土耳其报纸和电台继续对叙利亚进行敌意宣传。土耳其的这种政策不外是玩火的危险把戏。所有这一切同土耳其对叙利亚怀着和平意愿的保证毫无共同之处。土耳其政府应当考虑到，使这个地区维持这种危险的紧张局势和露骨地企图继续向叙利亚施加压力的做法，将使得关心保证中近东地区持久和平的国家不得不采取措施以便有效地维护这个地区的和平和安宁。
    布尔加宁指出，曼德列斯在信中批评了苏联的中近东政策，特别是对叙利亚的政策，甚至认为，只有苏联放弃这种政策，恢复土耳其和苏联的关系的基础才能建立。
    布尔加宁说，我们首先要着重指出，苏联执行的对待中近东国家的政策，是符合亚非国家万隆会议的原则的，而这些原则土耳其也是同意了的。在这一地区，苏联没有、也不想拥有经济的或其他的特权。苏联没有同包括叙利亚在内的任何一个阿拉伯国家签订过秘密条约或秘密协定。苏联所关心的是：在中近东实现和平，这一地区的国家有可能按照自己的民族利益过自由和独立的生活，没有任何国家去干涉他们的内政。
    土耳其常常责备苏联把自卫所需的武器卖给某些阿拉伯国家。但是，要知道，在二十年代，土耳其人在凯末尔领导下为自己的独立和自由而斗争的时候，苏联也用武器和弹药帮助过土耳其。当时土耳其人民欢迎这样的帮助。为什么现在土耳其政府反对苏联给予阿拉伯国家同样的无私援助呢？何况这些国家对土耳其没有过、也不可能有任何威胁。
    布尔加宁说，苏联珍视和土耳其的友谊，并且赞成这种友谊，但是它不愿意以放弃支持东方国家，特别是阿拉伯东方国家的民族独立的代价来换取这种友谊。
    布尔加宁问道：难道土耳其参加目前反对叙利亚的军事阴谋，就能在国际政治关系上得到了什么好处吗？难道汉德逊在安卡拉和伊斯坦布尔的会谈，土叙边境上侵略性的军事示威和其他种种诸如此类的行动，没有使土耳其在国际上的道义威信一落千丈吗？难道这些行动没有使土耳其在东方处于极其为难的境地吗？应该说不仅是在东方，就是在所有爱好和平的国家中间也是如此。
    布尔加宁指出，土耳其在参加北大西洋军事集团和巴格达军事集团以后，它竟轻视其他国家的民族利益，不顾本国的前途，对阿拉伯国家的内政极感兴趣，以致好像它已经是在东方推行殖民主义的西方国家的代表，并且逐渐以这些西方国家的名义行动。
    布尔加宁在信中说，总理先生，您在来信中对叙利亚提出指责，说它正在变为“武器库”。假如要说中近东那一个国家是兵器库，那么，无疑这不是爱好和平的小国叙利亚，而正是土耳其自己。
    苏联政府已经声明过，并认为有必要再次重申，苏联对于土耳其没有任何领土或其他要求，苏联的政策完全是以列宁提出的充分尊重土耳其国家的领土完整、主权和独立的原则为基础的。我们也相信，苏联和土耳其两国间的友谊和在巩固中近东国家的和平与安全方面的共同努力，在很大程度上会有助于在这一地区建立稳定和安静的局势，这对普遍和平也会有不可估价的意义。同时苏联政府决不想恶化土耳其同西方国家的关系以改善苏联和土耳其的关系。尽管苏联政府对北大西洋集团和巴格达军事条约采取的是尽人皆知的激烈反对的态度，但是它认为，土耳其参加这些军事集团并不会成为改善目前苏土关系的不可克服的障碍，正相反，这种关系的改善能够对缓和国际紧张局势和巩固两国安全的事业有重要贡献。
    布尔加宁指出，苏联政府曾一再声明愿意恢复苏土间以前的友好和信任关系。今年7月，苏联驻安卡拉大使受苏联政府的委托向土耳其政府提出正式建议，建议苏联和土耳其的国家领导人建立直接接触，以便就苏土关系的现状交换意见和讨论双方可能提出的、以建立两国的真诚和真正善邻关系为目的的建议，包括经济合作的问题在内。
    遗憾的是，我们的友好主张没有得到土耳其政府应有的反应，土耳其政府对待任何一个、甚至最小的一个以改善我们两国关系为目的的措施都抱着非常犹豫不决的态度。由此可见，土耳其政府在这个问题上执行着另外一种路线。
    布尔加宁最后说，我们认为，苏联在有关叙利亚局势和苏土关系的问题上所采取的立场已经阐明得非常清楚了，因此没有引起任何误解的根据。另一方面，为了巩固和平和求得互相信任，我们仍然愿意利用现有的一切机会来改善苏土关系，缓和中近东的紧张局势。我们希望土耳其政府能够注意苏联政府在上面所阐述的观点。
