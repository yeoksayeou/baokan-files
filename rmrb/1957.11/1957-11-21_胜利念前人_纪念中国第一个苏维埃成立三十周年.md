    Remembering Our Predecessors in Victory
    —Commemorating the 30th Anniversary of the Establishment of the First Soviet in China
    Fushi
    Thirty years ago today,
    A thunderclap shook the earth,
    A beam of red light shone in the East,
    The worker-peasant regime was first established.
    The newly established worker-peasant regime,
    Swept away the old world and old mountains and rivers,
    The revolution wielded an iron fist,
    And turned the world upside down.
    The great heroes who turned the world upside down,
    The vanguards of the Chinese working class,
    Opened up the great road of revolution,
    Cutting through thorns and clearing away flying wormwood.
    Not afraid of the dark clouds filling the sky,
    The red flag flies high in Haifeng and Lufeng,
    Comrade Peng Pai is wise and brave,
    And the masses cheer and follow him.
    Temporarily wipe away the bloodstains of setbacks,
    It is difficult to break the steel will of heroes,
    Do not hesitate on the difficult road,
    The successors followed in the footsteps of the martyrs.
    Today's victory reminds us of our predecessors,
    Red China is seething with excitement,
    The heroic undertaking has greatly developed,
    The earth is covered with red flowers.

    胜利念前人
    ——纪念中国第一个苏维埃成立三十周年
    俯拾
    三十年前今日里，
    霹雳一声震天地，
    一道红光射东方，
    工农政权初创立。
    初创立的工农新政权，
    一扫旧世界旧山川，
    革命使出铁手腕，
    直把天地倒翻转。
    翻转天地的大英雄，
    中国工人的急先锋，
    开辟革命大道路，
    斩断荆棘割飞蓬。
    不怕满天乌云浓，
    红旗高飘海陆丰，
    彭湃同志智又勇，
    万众欢呼齐跟从。
    暂时挫折拭血迹，
    难使英雄钢腰折，
    道路艰难不徘徊，
    前仆后继追先烈。
    今日胜利念前人，
    红色中国尽沸腾，
    英雄的创业大发展，
    地球上红花开满身。
