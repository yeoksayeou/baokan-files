    Changes at Xin Zhuangzi Mine
    By Our Reporter Wu Rongjiang

    I have visited the Huainan Xin Zhuangzi Coal Mine more than once. The first time was in 1953. This was on the eve of the mine's transformation. At that time, this mine was the smallest producing mine in Huainan. I toured the level roadway and production sites, which were only seventy-five meters deep from the surface. Although mine cars had replaced some human and donkey labor in hauling coal, the backward production methods left over from before liberation still existed in many places. Workers still pushed heavy mine cars step by step in low tunnels. In small roadways where mine cars couldn't enter, one could still see two workers carrying baskets weighing a hundred or so catties, walking with their backs bent. Coal cutting machines, pneumatic picks, and hand picks were all used simultaneously. On the ground coal storage yard, countless people carried baskets of coal, walked across narrow planks, and dumped the coal into trains. The workers were hardworking, but the output was not high. The workers told me that they would personally transform this mine, which only produced 150,000 to 160,000 tons of coal annually, into a mine producing over a million tons of coal.
    In 1954, the massive mine reconstruction project began according to the wishes of the employees. By the beginning of this year, the reconstruction project had been completed, and the annual coal production had reached 1.2 million tons. Recently, I visited this coal mine again and found that its appearance had been completely renewed. The mine has been extended from seventy-five meters deep to one hundred and forty meters deep. Workers now use electric drills for all coal mining. On the working face, with a series of explosions from gunpowder, coal chunks collapsed like an avalanche, and the black, shiny coal chunks flowed like streams along hundreds of meters of chain conveyors and belt conveyors, converging into mine cars in the mine's main transportation roadway. In the spacious and bright transportation roadway, which was paved with double tracks, a train of trolley locomotives pulled long lines of mine cars every few minutes. When the coal cars reached the pithead yard, they automatically tipped the coal into the underground coal bunker, and the coal from the bunker was fed by machines into a continuously rotating large belt over six hundred meters long, which transported it to the surface at a rapid speed of ninety-six meters per minute on a sloping ramp. In a small room, an operator managed the belt conveyor from underground to the surface. A row of indicator lights in the room emitted a beautiful red light, indicating that the belt conveyor was operating normally. Once the coal reached the surface, it was conveyed by other belt conveyors into the railway coal bunkers. A female technician pointed to two coal blending machines that almost occupied a large room and said: "These two machines are also remotely controlled. A worker operates the two coal blending machines back and forth, evenly distributing the coal from the mine into eight railway coal bunkers." Through the window, I saw a train coming from afar, opening the hopper under the coal bunker, and the coal poured down like a black waterfall, quickly filling a large section of the train car.
    The reconstruction cost of this mine was about one-third less than that of building a new large mine with an annual output of 900,000 tons, and the time it took for the output to reach the designed production level was also shorter than that of building a new large mine.
    This mine is now facing even greater changes, and the employees are discussing an even larger change plan than before. A roadway thousands of meters long has already begun to be developed, leading to a coal seam originally planned for future mining, which will be mined ahead of schedule. After this plan is realized, the coal production of the Xin Zhuangzi Coal Mine can be increased to 2.5 million tons.
    At that time, the "underground railway" of this mine will be greatly extended, the trolley locomotives will shuttle underground like shuttles, and the large trains loading coal on the surface will be more frequent. The industrial plaza will also be expanded accordingly, and the mining area market will also be more prosperous. Because this mine is being reconstructed on the basis of the original mine, the cost can be much lower, the organization can be much smaller, and there is no need to add complete sets of equipment.

### 新庄孜矿的变化

    新庄孜矿的变化
    本报记者　吴荣江
    我不止一次到过淮南新庄孜煤矿。第一次是1953年。这是矿井开始变化的前夕。那时这个矿是淮南最小的一个生产矿井。我沿着那仅仅只有离地面七十五公尺深的水平巷道和生产地点参观。虽然矿车代替了部分人和毛驴拉煤，但是解放前遗留下的落后生产方式，在许多场所依然存在。工人还是在低矮的洞子里，一步一步地推着笨重矿车。在矿车通不进去的小巷道里，仍可看到两个工人抬着百十斤重的筐子，曲背走着。割煤机、风镐和手镐采煤同时存在。在地面储煤场上，数不清的人群，抬着满筐的煤，从狭窄的跳板上走过，把煤倒在火车里。工人是辛苦的，但产量不高。工人们告诉我：他们要亲手把这个每年只产十五六万吨煤炭的矿井，改建成生产上百万吨煤的矿井。
    1954年，巨大的矿井改建工程按照职工的意愿开始了。到今年年初，改建工程已经完成，每年产煤量已达到一百二十万吨。最近，我又访问了这个煤矿，发现它的面貌已焕然一新。矿井已由过去离地面七十五公尺延深到一百四十公尺。工人在全部用电钻采煤。工作面上随着一连串的炮药爆炸声，煤块像山崩地裂一样坍塌下来，乌黑发亮的煤块顺着几百公尺长的一道道链板运输机和皮带机，像小溪般汇集到矿井运输大巷的矿车里。宽敞明亮的铺着双轨的运输大巷，几分钟就有一列架线式电机车拉着长长一排矿车奔驰而过。煤炭车到了井口车场，又自动地把煤翻入地下煤仓，煤炭从煤仓由机器喂到一道旋转不停的有六百多公尺长的大皮带里，在斜斜的坡道上，以一分钟九十六公尺的飞快速度运上地面。在一个小屋子里，一个操纵工在管理着从地下到地面的皮带运输机，屋里的一排指示灯射出美丽的红光，表示皮带机运转正常。煤炭到了地面，又顺着另几台皮带机进入铁路煤仓。一个女技术员指着两台几乎占去一大间房屋的配煤机说：这两台机器也都是由远方操纵，一个工人把两台配煤机开得来回跑，把矿井里出来的煤均匀地分在八个铁路煤仓里。我透过窗门看到一列火车从远方驰来，开到煤仓下面打开漏斗，煤炭像黑色的瀑布，一会儿就装满一大节火车皮。
    这个矿井的改建费用比新建年产九十万吨大矿井少三分之一左右，而且产量达到设计产量水平的时间也比新建大矿井的短。
    在这个矿井，现在又面临着更大的变化，职工中又在讨论着比前更大的变化计划。一条长达几千公尺的巷道已经开始开拓了，通向一个原计划今后开采的煤层，将提前开采。这项计划实现后，新庄孜煤矿的产煤量可提高到二百五十万吨。
    那时，这个矿场的“地下铁道”将大大延长，架线电机车在地下像穿梭一般，地面上装煤来往的大火车也将更加频繁，工业广场也将相应扩大，矿区市场也将更繁荣。因为这个矿又是在原有矿井基础上改建，费用可以少得多，机构可以小得多，也不再需要成套增添设备。（附图片）
