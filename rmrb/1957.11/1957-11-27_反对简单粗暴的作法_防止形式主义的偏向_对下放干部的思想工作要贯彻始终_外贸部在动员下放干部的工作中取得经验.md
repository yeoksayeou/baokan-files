Xinhua News Agency, 25th: Xinhua News Agency reporter Lin Yao reports: The Ministry of Foreign Trade has decided to transfer 1,560 cadres to lower levels and will send them in batches to the countryside to participate in agricultural labor or to work in grassroots units of the foreign trade system. The organizational restructuring is also underway. Recently, the reporter interviewed the person in charge of the Chinese Communist Party Committee of this ministry, asking him to introduce the work experience of this stage.

This person in charge said that in solving the organizational problem, we have clearly established an idea, that is, we must fully trust the majority of the masses and rely on the mass line of combining leadership with the masses to solve the organizational problem, changing the past subjective approach of a few leaders doing the math first and then assigning tasks to lower-level units. Therefore, in early November, we guided all staff members to launch extensive airing of views, big debates, and then mobilized the masses to discuss how to reform the organization. Leading cadres at all levels also participated in the airing of views and debates by the masses. Although there were some differences between the opinions of leaders and the masses at the beginning, they quickly reached a consensus after mutual research. The numbers of personnel reductions proposed by the administrative units and various companies of this ministry after mass discussions totaled about 40% of the total number of cadres. Based on this indicator, the ministry leadership, taking into account the reality that the Ministry of Foreign Trade frequently holds overseas exhibitions and often sends trade delegations and business groups abroad in addition to the fixed routine work of various departments, requiring a certain number of mobile personnel, finally decided to reduce personnel by 35%.

This person in charge said that after the organizational structure and staffing were generally determined, the focus of work naturally shifted to discussing the issue of cadres being transferred to lower levels to participate in agricultural labor.

The person in charge emphasized that throughout the entire process of transferring cadres to lower levels, political and ideological education must be done from beginning to end, and we must prevent and oppose the style of simple and crude work and the tendency of pursuing a sensational and formalistic approach. In order to enable staff members to have a correct understanding of participating in agricultural labor, we organized all cadres to focus on studying Comrade Deng Xiaoping's section on the cadre line in his report on the rectification movement, and various units also held some report meetings to focus on explaining the significance of cadres participating in agricultural labor. Leading cadres of various units also gained a detailed understanding of the specific ideological situation of many cadres. The leaders of the Tea Company held individual talks with fifty cadres, learning that many people still have many incorrect views on participating in agricultural labor, such as being afraid of getting dirty, being afraid of a hard life, and being afraid of losing face; feeling that it is not worth it for intellectuals to labor, that it is a waste of talent; that there is no future in being a farmer for a long time; and some are worried that after going to the countryside, they will lose their profession or foreign language, and that there will be no one to take care of their families left in the city, and so on. In response to these ideas, we further guided the masses to discuss four questions: 1. Is it glorious or shameful to go to the countryside? 2. Are you going to train or to enjoy happiness? 3. Are personal interests and revolutionary prospects consistent, and how should they be combined? 4. What exactly do intellectuals gain and lose by going to the countryside? Debates were launched around these issues, which improved the understanding of many people who had the above concerns. In particular, the ministry leadership clearly announced the specific regulations regarding wages and benefits after training in the countryside, which further encouraged the enthusiasm of staff members. On the basis of such thorough and meticulous ideological education, a surge of enthusiasm for participating in agricultural labor quickly formed within the entire scope. Within five days, more than 4,000 cadres voluntarily signed up to be transferred to lower levels. However, ideological work cannot be relaxed even after signing up.

The person in charge emphasized that in carrying out this work, leading cadres at all levels must also be educated to implement the policy of unity and the spirit of being responsible to the end for downward-transferred cadres. Those who cannot figure it out for the time being should be explained to patiently, and those with family difficulties should be helped to settle down properly, so that every downward-transferred cadre will happily embark on the labor front, opposing the erroneous ideas and practices of pushing things out of the way and being irresponsible. Now this ministry is carefully reviewing the list of downward-transferred cadres.

    反对简单粗暴的作法　防止形式主义的偏向
    对下放干部的思想工作要贯彻始终
    外贸部在动员下放干部的工作中取得经验
    据新华社25日讯　新华社记者林耀报道：对外贸易部已经决定下放干部一千五百六十人，并将分批下乡参加农业劳动或到外贸系统基层单位去工作；机构的调整工作也正在进行。最近记者访问了这个部的中共党委负责人，请他介绍了这一阶段的工作经验。
    这位负责人说，在解决机构问题上，我们明确地树立了一个思想，就是一定要充分相信群众的多数，依靠领导与群众相结合的群众路线来解决机构问题，改变过去先由少数领导人算账，然后向下级单位分配任务的主观主义作法。因此在11月上旬就引导全部工作人员以组织机构为中心展开大鸣大放，大争大辩，接着又发动群众讨论如何改革机构问题。各级领导干部也都参加了群众的鸣放和争辩，领导和群众的意见虽然开始有些距离，但是在互相研究后很快地取得了一致的认识。综合这个部行政单位和各公司经过群众讨论后提出的紧缩人员的数字约为全体干部总数的40％。部的领导上在这个指标的基础上，实事求是地考虑到对外贸易部除各部门固定的经常工作外，还经常举办出国展览会，时常派出贸易代表团和业务小组到国外等，需有一定的机动人员，因而，最后确定紧缩人员35％。
    这位负责人说，在机构设置和人员编制大体上确定下来以后，工作中心就自然而然地转入讨论干部下放参加农业劳动的问题上来。
    负责人强调说，在整个下放干部的工作过程中，必须自始至终做好政治思想教育工作，必须防止与反对简单粗暴的作风和追求轰轰烈烈的形式主义偏向。为了使工作人员对于参加农业劳动有正确的认识，我们组织全体干部着重学习了邓小平同志关于整风运动报告中的干部路线部分，各单位也分别举行了一些报告会着重说明干部参加农业劳动的意义。各单位的领导干部还深入细致地了解许多干部的具体思想情况。茶叶公司的领导人同五十个干部作了个别谈话，了解到不少人对于参加农业劳动还是存在着很多不正确的看法，如怕脏、怕生活苦，怕丢人；觉得知识分子去劳动得不偿失，是大材小用；长期当农民没有前途；还有的顾虑下农村后会丢掉专业或外文，怕家庭留在城市无人照顾，等等。针对这些思想，又进一步引导群众讨论了四个问题：一、到农村去是光荣还是丢人？二、去锻炼还是去享福？三、个人利益和革命前途是否一致，应该如何结合？四、知识分子到农村究竟得到什么？失掉什么？围绕这些问题又展开了辩论，使许多有以上顾虑的人提高了认识，特别是部的领导上明确宣布了到农村锻炼后，工资、福利待遇等具体规定，更加鼓舞了工作人员的积极性。在这样深入细致的思想教育工作的基础上，迅速在全部范围内形成了要求参加农业劳动的热潮。五天之内，自愿报名要求下放的干部达到四千多人。但是在报名后，思想工作仍然不能放松。
    这位负责人强调说，在进行这一工作中还要教育各级领导干部对于下放干部必须贯彻团结的方针和负责到底的精神，暂时想不通的应该十分耐心地进行解释，家庭有困难要帮助他们妥善地安置，要使每个下放干部都心情愉快地走上劳动战线，反对推出了事和一些不负责任的错误思想和作法。现在这个部正在慎重地审批下放干部的名单。
