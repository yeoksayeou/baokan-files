In order to introduce the excellent plays selected by various provinces and cities through performances, observations, and careful selection, to provide mutual exchanges among various opera genres and for opera workers to use as reference, to preserve the essence of opera scripts, and for international cultural exchange, the cultural bureaus of various provinces and cities have carefully selected the most outstanding opera scripts to be compiled into "A Collection of Chinese Local Operas" under the editorship of Comrade Tian Han, Chairman of the Chinese Dramatists Association. The complete collection will consist of approximately twenty volumes, each volume containing approximately 300,000 words, including: a foreword, production photos, scripts, a distribution map of opera genres, etc. The first volume will also include a general preface by Comrade Tian Han. The entire collection will be published by the Chinese Drama Publishing House starting in January 1958.　　　　　　　　(Zhi)
