    The Soviet people, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the great leader Lenin, thoroughly overthrew the rulers who had long oppressed the Russian people forty years ago, completed the socialist revolution, opened up a new era for human history, and set an example for the working people of the world, especially the Chinese people, in their struggle for complete liberation. Under the leadership of our Party and Chairman Mao, our people, following the path taken by the Soviet people, after decades of struggle, finally defeated the enemies who had long oppressed and exploited the Chinese people, and basically completed the socialist transformation last year. Since then, we have been building a new socialist life at a rapid pace.

    In 1950, I responded to the call of the motherland to defend the security of our country and Korea, and joined the Volunteer Army to fight the American invaders in Korea. After the Third Battle, my feet were frostbitten and had to be amputated. At that time, I collapsed. I often pondered my future and my way out, and I always felt that it would be difficult for me to live from then on. In my depression, it suddenly occurred to me: wasn't the body of Comrade Maresiev, the Soviet Flying General who lost his feet during the Great Patriotic War, the same as mine? If he could walk, couldn't I? The tenacious spirit of the Soviet comrades awakened my desire to return to life. So, I worked hard to learn to stand up, slowly learn to walk, and ride a bicycle. Finally, in 1955, my ideal became a reality. I embarked on a new life path, learned to drive cars and tractors, and began driving the magnificent C-80 tractor on the land of the State-run Boai Farm, working shifts like a person with all four limbs. When I went to the Soviet Union for recuperation last year, I specifically visited Comrade Maresiev, the Soviet legless Flying General, and he also told me about his experience in overcoming difficulties and embarking on a new life.

    The Chinese and Soviet people have forged an inseparable flesh-and-blood relationship. The Soviet people are always concerned about us. Last September, at the invitation of the Soviet people, I went to the beautiful Sochi spa resort on the Black Sea for recuperation. On the train, a Soviet engineer asked me, "How is the life of the Chinese people? Is Chairman Mao healthy?" During my recuperation, when I took a car to visit a pier by the sea, the Soviet people on the road, upon seeing a car carrying Chinese people, would stand up and wave from afar, shouting "Long live Chairman Mao!" During a break on the way, before I even got out of the car, they rushed to the car to shake hands and kiss us. The Soviet people are so sincere to us.

    I personally witnessed the great achievements of the Soviet Union's construction in various fields and the happy and prosperous life of the Soviet people. During my visits, the lofty and far-reaching life ideals of the Soviet people and their glorious tradition of loving labor left me with an unforgettable impression.

    苏联人民给了我生活的力量
    李来财
    苏联人民四十年前在共产党和伟大领袖列宁的领导下，彻底推翻了长期压在俄国人民头上的统治者，完成了社会主义革命，给人类历史开辟了新时代，给全世界劳动人民特别是中国人民争取彻底解放作了榜样。我国人民在我们党和毛主席领导下，沿着苏联人民所走过的道路，经过数十年的斗争，终于打败了长期压迫剥削中国人民的敌人，并在去年基本上完成了社会主义改造。从此我们一日千里地建设着社会主义新生活。
    我在1950年响应祖国召唤，保卫我国和朝鲜的安全，参加了志愿军赴朝鲜和美国侵略者作战。在三次战役结束后，双脚因受了冻伤截去了。这时我就躺倒了。经常沉思自己将来的前途和出路，总觉得自己从此很难生活下去了。在沉闷中我忽然想到：苏联卫国战争时失去双脚的飞将军马列西叶夫同志的身体不是和我自己一样吗？他能走我就不能走吗？苏联同志的坚毅精神，唤起了我重新走向生活的念头。于是，我努力学着站立起来，慢慢学着走路，骑车。终于1955年理想变成了现实，我走上新的生活道路，学会了驾驶汽车，拖拉机，开始驾驶着雄伟的C—80号拖拉机在国营博爱农场的土地上奔驶，和四肢齐全的人一样值班工作。去年我赴苏休养时，专门访问了苏联无脚飞将军马列西叶夫同志，他还对我谈了他如何克服困难，走上新生活的经验。
    中苏人民已经结成了血肉不可分的关系。苏联人民经常在关心着我们。去年9月间，我应苏联人民的邀请到美丽的黑海索契温泉疗养区疗养。在火车里苏联一位工程师问我：“中国人民生活怎样？毛主席健康吧？”当我在休养期间乘汽车去海边一个码头参观时，公路上的苏联人民，看见中国人乘坐的汽车，很远就站起来打招呼喊毛主席万岁。途中休息还没下汽车，他们就抢上汽车握手、接吻。苏联人对我们就是这样真诚。
    我在苏联亲眼看到了苏联各方面建设的巨大成就，和苏联人民的美满幸福生活。在我的参观访问中，苏联人民那种崇高远大的生活理想，和热爱劳动的光荣传统，给了我难忘的印象。
