    Will Never Forget
    Lü Opera Actress Lang Xianfen
    In November 1956, I had the honor of participating in the National People's Congress delegation's visit to the Soviet Union. During the half-month visit, we met millions of Soviet people. These Soviet friends shook hands and embraced us tightly, and their friendly smiles and enthusiastic emotions from those times together are unforgettable to this day.
    In the Kremlin, we met many experienced and long-tested leaders. Comrade Voroshilov, whose hair was completely white, asked us with great concern: "Are you tired from the flight?" "How is the food?" "Are you sleeping well?" We felt that Old Voroshilov was as kind as a grandfather.
    People in factories, theaters, schools, and rural areas greeted us with smiling faces. Everywhere we heard cheers of "Long live the unbreakable friendship between the great Chinese and Soviet people!" and "Long live Sino-Soviet unity!"
    When we arrived at the Lenin Factory, many workers, their hands covered in oil and wearing work clothes, ran to greet us. They said, "Chinese brothers, we have been looking forward to your arrival!" In a workshop, I met a young and beautiful female worker. She told me that she had known for a long time that the Chinese delegation was coming to the Soviet Union because she had received a letter from her husband, an engineer, from China. She said to me, "I am very envious that my husband can go to China. Although I have not had the opportunity to go to China yet, I am very happy to meet the representatives of the Chinese people."
    In Tashkent, the capital of the Uzbek Republic, we visited the Red Uzbekistan Collective Farm. The members of the farm welcomed and received us warmly with infinitely joyful smiles, treating us as their dearest guests.
    I had the honor of visiting Comrade Ulanova, a ballet dancer with international renown. I will never forget the happy moments I spent as a guest in her home. She treated me like a younger sister, and she said to me kindly, "My feelings for the Chinese people are very deep. I love the Chinese people as much as I love the Soviet people. Look at the things hanging on the walls and placed on the tables in my room. Many of them were given to me by Chinese friends. Some people say that my room is like a room lived in by Chinese people!" Here, I once again felt the sincere friendship and warm feelings that the Soviet people expressed towards the Chinese people.
    I will never forget the children singing Chinese songs around me when I visited the "Children's Palace" in Leningrad. That little girl with the pair of sparkling blue eyes warmly gave me a red scarf and asked me to be sure to convey the warm greetings of Soviet children to their young Chinese friends. We met with university students in many venues, and we saw that the Soviet people guaranteed their happy future with their own victories.
    I will never forget the excellent performances of Soviet artists that I saw at the Moscow Grand Theatre and the Stanislavsky Music Theatre, which gave me an exceptionally valuable learning opportunity. Every program was extremely wonderful, which made me deeply realize that only in the great Soviet country could there be such art and such great artists.

    永远不会忘记
    吕剧演员　郎咸芬
    1956年11月，我荣幸的参加全国人民代表大会代表团访问了苏联。在访苏的半个月中间，我们会见了千千万万的苏联人民，这些苏联朋友和我们紧紧地握手、拥抱，他们和我们在一起的那些友谊的微笑和热烈的情绪，至今难忘。
    在克里姆林宫，我们会见了许多经验丰富久经考验的领导者。头发已经全白了的伏罗希洛夫同志非常关怀地问我们：“坐飞机累了吧？”“吃饭怎么样？”“睡的好吗？”使我们感到伏老就像老祖父那样的慈祥。
    在工厂、剧院、学校和农村的人们，都用笑脸迎接着我们。到处都听到：“伟大的中苏人民牢不可破的友谊万岁！”“中苏团结万岁！”的欢呼声。
    当我们到达列宁工厂的时候，许多工人满手油污，穿着工作服就跑来迎接我们。他们说：“中国兄弟们，可把你们盼来了！”在一个车间里，我遇到了一位年轻漂亮的女工，她告诉我，她早就知道中国的代表团要来苏联，因为她接到她爱人——一位工程师从中国寄来的信。她对我说“我非常羡慕我爱人能到中国去。我虽然还没有到中国去的机会，但是能见到中国人民的代表还是非常高兴。”
    在乌兹别克共和国首都——塔什干，我们访问了红色乌兹别克斯坦农庄，庄员们带着无限快乐的笑容热烈地欢迎和接待我们。把我们当做最亲爱的客人。
    我荣幸的拜访了享有国际声誉的芭蕾舞演员乌兰诺娃同志。我永远忘不了在她家做客时度过的幸福时刻。她对我像对待亲妹妹一样，她亲切地对我说：“我对中国人民的感情是非常深厚的，我爱中国人民，就像爱苏联人民一样。你看我房间里墙上挂的、桌上摆的，有很多东西都是中国朋友送给我的。有人说我的房间就像中国人住的房间一样！”在这里我又一次感到苏联人民对中国人民所表示的真挚友谊和亲切的感情。
    我永远也不会忘记，在列宁格勒访问“少年宫”时，那些围绕在我身边唱着中国歌的小朋友。那个闪着一双蓝色眼睛的小姑娘，她热诚地赠给我一条红领巾，并要我一定转达苏联儿童对中国少年朋友们的亲切问候。我们曾经在许多会场上和大学生们见面，我们看到苏联人民以自己的胜利，保证了他们幸福的未来。
    我永远也不会忘记，在莫斯科大剧院、斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基音乐剧院看到的苏联艺术家的优秀表演，使我得到异常珍贵的学习机会。每一个节目都是极其精彩的，使我深深地体会到只有在伟大的苏维埃国家，才会有这样的艺术，才会有这样伟大的艺术家。
