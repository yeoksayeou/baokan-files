    "Murder, Inc."
    Around ten o'clock on the morning of October 25th this year, two masked bandits walked into a barbershop at the corner of Seventh Street and Fifty-Third Street in New York. They first warned the barbershop owner, who was sitting at the entrance, "Don't make a sound, or you'll lose your head!" Then, they calmly walked up to a customer who was getting a haircut, fired ten shots at him, and left. Although the New York police have already determined that the murdered man was Albert Anastasia, the "chief executioner" of the notorious "Murder, Inc.," who had been running rampant and killing people like flies, and that the murder was due to infighting within the gang, the two bandits who assassinated Anastasia can also get away with it, just as Anastasia had been shielded and condoned by the New York police for decades.
    "Murder, Inc." is a New York-based organization of gangsters who specialize in murder. The citizens of New York are terrified at the mention of it. The 1930s and 1940s were the peak of this terror organization. After 1940, the activities of "Murder, Inc." became more covert. According to the American "Newsweek," "Murder, Inc." charged anywhere from fifty to five thousand U.S. dollars for each assassination.
    The American "Daily Worker" exposed the inside story of "Murder, Inc." on November 4th. The "Daily Worker" said that Anastasia was only an executioner, and behind him were several big bosses, including tycoons controlling the black market, gambling kings, drug traffickers and human traffickers, and notorious labor scabs. More than seventy people have been investigated as having been killed by "Murder, Inc." Among them, Anastasia personally killed thirty-one, and thirty-two were killed on his orders. The vast majority of the victims were kind people or people with progressive tendencies.
    Anastasia had been charged with murder five times, but each time he was acquitted by the American judicial authorities. During World War II, Anastasia even served as a military policeman for the United States. He bribed a member of former New York Governor Dewey's staff to destroy his records. In 1955, Anastasia spent a year in prison, but not because he committed numerous murders, but because he evaded a huge income tax of US$12,000.

    “暗杀公司”
    今年10月25日上午十点钟的光景，两名蒙面匪徒走进了纽约第七号街与第五十三号街转角处一所旅馆的理发厅。他们首先警告坐在门首的理发厅主人说：“不许声张，否则当心脑袋搬家！”接着，他们从容不迫地走到一位坐在那里理发的客人面前，对准他连续开了十枪，然后扬长而去。纽约警察当局虽然已经查出被杀者是曾经横行一时、杀人如麻的“暗杀公司”“首席刽子手”阿尔伯特·阿纳斯塔西亚，被杀的原因是匪党内讧，可是，正像数十年以来阿纳斯塔西亚受着纽约警察当局的包庇、纵容一样，暗杀阿纳斯塔西亚的两名匪徒也可以逍遥法外。
    “暗杀公司”是纽约的以谋杀为业的匪徒组织。纽约市民提起它来，莫不谈虎色变。1930年至1940年是这个恐怖组织的极盛时期。1940年以后，“暗杀公司”的活动比较隐蔽。据美国“新闻周刊”透露，“暗杀公司”暗杀一人收费自美金五十元至五千元不等。
    美国“工人日报”11月4日揭发了“暗杀公司”的内幕。“工人日报”说，阿纳斯塔西亚只是一名刽子手，在他背后操纵的是几位大老板，其中有控制黑市交易的巨商，有赌博大王，有贩毒贩运妇女的恶棍，还有作恶多端的工贼。被“暗杀公司”所杀害的人，业已调查出来的已达七十余名。其中由阿纳斯塔西亚亲手杀害的计有三十一人，由他发出命令而被杀害的计有三十二人。被害者绝大多数都是善良的或是具进步倾向的人士。
    阿纳斯塔西亚曾经五次被控以杀人罪，但是每一次都得到了美国司法当局的开脱。第二次世界大战时期，阿纳斯塔西亚竟充当了美国的宪兵。他买通了前纽约州州长杜威的一名属员，设法销毁了有关他的档案。1955年，阿纳斯塔西亚坐了一年的监狱，但是，这并不是因为他杀人累累，而是因为他逃避了一笔数达美金一万二千元之巨的所得税。
