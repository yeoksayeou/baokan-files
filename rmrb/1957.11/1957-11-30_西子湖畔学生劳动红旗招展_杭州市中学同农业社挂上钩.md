Student Labor Red Flags Flutter on the Banks of West Lake
Hangzhou Middle Schools Linked with Agricultural Cooperatives

    (Reported by our newspaper) Since the beginning of this semester, middle schools in Hangzhou have universally strengthened labor education for students and regularly organize students to participate in various forms of physical labor, mainly agricultural labor. Many schools have established fixed connections with agricultural production cooperatives in the suburbs and have formulated specific measures for students to go to the countryside to participate in voluntary labor on a regular basis.
    How to establish fixed relationships with agricultural cooperatives? The method adopted by these schools is to assign students in the third year of junior high school and above to production teams of the agricultural cooperatives they are connected with, linking them directly with the production teams. At the same time, the schools draw up schedules for students to participate in physical labor, so that students can collectively go to the production teams they are connected with on fixed days to engage in physical labor for half a day to a day. For example, Hangzhou No. 2 Middle School has assigned more than 1,200 students in 24 classes from the third year of junior high school and above to the production teams of six agricultural cooperatives in the suburbs, including Wangjiang, Sijiqing, Hongxing, Qianjiang, and Wulong Nos. 4 and 7 Cooperatives, and stipulated that they go to the countryside for labor once every two to three weeks, until the students in the class graduate. In addition to establishing a fixed connection with the Nanshan Agricultural Production Cooperative, a national model pig-raising cooperative, Hangzhou No. 4 Middle School has also signed a contract with the cooperative. The school and the agricultural cooperative jointly form a leading group to be jointly responsible for students' participation in labor. The contract stipulates that the agricultural cooperative is responsible for providing technical guidance on agricultural production labor to students, regularly giving students field reports, and explaining agricultural production technical knowledge to enrich students' practical knowledge; the school will set up science lectures for the agricultural cooperative, regularly explain scientific knowledge related to agricultural production to the members, and use spare time and holidays to organize students to assist the agricultural cooperative in carrying out recreational and sports activities and literacy campaigns.
    At present, more than 20 ordinary middle schools in Hangzhou (nearly half of the city's schools) have established this connection system with agricultural cooperatives. Seven or eight middle schools have directly assigned students to production teams and regularly organized students to participate in agricultural labor, and many schools are also carrying out this work. In the past month or so, almost every day a large number of students from middle schools in Hangzhou, carrying red flags, have marched mightily to the countryside, to the banks of West Lake, and worked with the peasants. Among the more than 28,000 high school and junior high school students in the city, except for some younger and physically weaker lower grade students, most have participated in labor three or four times, and some have participated six or seven times. In labor, they can humbly learn from the peasants, work conscientiously, abide by the rules and regulations of the agricultural cooperative, cherish crops, and respect old peasants. Therefore, they are warmly welcomed by the agricultural cooperatives. Many agricultural cooperatives, with the strong support of the students during the busy farming season, have achieved timely harvesting and sowing. For example, with the support of the students, Gudang Township completed the harvesting of more than 5,000 mu of late rice in the township ten days earlier. Through labor, visits, and heart-to-heart talks, the broad masses of students have established deep friendships with the agricultural cooperatives they are connected with and made friends with the peasants. The Yunjushan Agricultural Cooperative in Hangzhou is a cooperative that Hangzhou No. 11 Middle School's Senior One (1) class often connects with. Xu Baiquan, the director of the cooperative, is a class friend of this class. Recently, when No. 11 Middle School celebrated its anniversary, the cooperative specially sent two lambs to congratulate the school anniversary and as a souvenir of establishing a permanent friendship.

    西子湖畔学生劳动红旗招展
    杭州市中学同农业社挂上钩
    本报讯　杭州市各中等学校在本学期开学以来，普遍加强了对学生的劳动教育，并定期组织学生参加各种体力劳动，主要是农业劳动。许多学校已和郊区农业生产合作社建立了固定联系，订出了学生下乡参加义务劳动的具体办法，使学生参加义务劳动经常化。
    怎样和农业社建立固定关系呢？这些学校采取的办法就是把初中三年级以上的学生，按班级分别编到所联系的农业社的生产小队里面去，和生产小队直接挂上钩。同时，学校里排出学生参加体力劳动的日程表，使学生在固定的日子里集体到自己所联系的生产小队里去从事半天到一天的体力劳动。如杭州第二中学，就是把初三以上二十四个班级的一千二百多学生，分别编到郊区的望江、四季青、红星、钱江、乌龙四社、七社等六个农业社的生产小队里去，并规定每隔两个星期到三个星期下乡劳动一次，一直到该班学生毕业为止。杭州第四中学除了和所联系的全国养猪模范生产合作社——南山农业生产合作社建立固定联系外，还和合作社订立了合同，由学校和农业社联合组成领导小组，共同负责学生参加劳动事宜。合同里规定农业社负责对学生进行农业生产劳动的技术指导，定期给学生作田间报告，讲解农业生产技术知识，以丰富学生的实际知识；学校则为农业社设置科学讲座，定期给社员讲解有关农业生产的科学知识，并利用课余时间和假期组织学生协助农业社开展文娱体育活动和扫盲运动。
    现在，杭州市二十多个普通中学（将近全市一半左右的学校）已和农业社建立了这种联系制度。有七、八所中学已经把学生直接编入生产小队，定期组织学生参加农业劳动，还有许多学校也正在进行这一工作。近一个多月来，杭州市各中学几乎每天都有大批学生，打着红旗，浩浩荡荡地奔向农村，奔向西子湖畔，和农民一起劳动。全市二万八千多名高、初中学生中除了一部分年纪小、身体差的低年级学生以外，一般都参加过劳动三、四次，多的达到六、七次。他们在劳动中都能虚心向农民学习，认真干活，遵守农业社的规章制度，爱护农作物，尊敬老农民，因此，受到农业社的热烈欢迎。许多农业社在农忙的时候，由于得到学生的大力支援，做到及时收获和播种。如古荡乡在同学们的支援下，提早十天完成了全乡五千多亩晚稻的收割任务；广大学生通过劳动和参观访问、谈心等活动，已和所联系的农业社建立了深厚的友谊，和农民交上了朋友。杭州市云居山农业社是杭州第十一中学高一（1）班经常联系的合作社，该社社长徐柏泉是这个班级的班友。最近，十一中庆祝校庆，这个合作社特地送来了二只小羊，祝贺校庆，并作为建立永久友谊的纪念。　（杭州日报编辑部）
