Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan Special Dispatch: The Wuhan Municipal Federation of Trade Unions recently held a meeting of activists from public-private joint ventures. The purpose of the meeting was to strengthen trade union work in public-private joint ventures and to educate workers to raise their class consciousness and resist the erosion of bourgeois ideology. More than 1,300 people attended the meeting, including trade union cadres and activists from municipal and district trade union organizations and public-private joint ventures.

At the meeting, workers Sun Weicai and Yuan Bin introduced how, under the leadership of the Party and with the help of the workers, they overcame the erosion of bourgeois ideology and returned from the wrong path. Representatives from the Hanyang Machine Factory, a public-private joint venture, introduced how their factory's trade union conducted socialist education for employees and mobilized employees to fight against illegal capitalists.

Sun Weicai, a lathe operator at the Hanyang Machine Factory, a public-private joint venture, was once lured by illegal capitalists to do private work in "underground factories." He was exploited, his health deteriorated, and he could not muster any energy while working in the factory during the day, which affected production. Later, he even stole machines from the public-private joint venture to work for the capitalists. In order to educate him and all the workers, the factory leadership launched a factory-wide debate specifically on the issue of doing private work. Many workers pointed out in the debate that Sun Weicai was helping capitalists develop capitalism and undermining the foundation of socialism. After several debates and Party education, Sun Weicai recognized and corrected his mistakes, and made great progress in both production and learning. Many workers in the factory who had been lured by illegal capitalists to do private work also raised their awareness and concentrated on production in the factory. The factory overfulfilled its output value plans for August, September, and October, changing the chaotic situation of failing to complete production plans for several consecutive months in the past. Yuan Bin, a fitter at the Dali Electric Motor Factory, a public-private joint venture, took some materials and tools from the factory because he was corrupted by the capitalists. Therefore, for a long time, he did not dare to boldly expose the illegal acts of capitalists stealing state property. In August of this year, under the education of the trade union, he raised his awareness, confessed his problems to the organization, returned what he had taken to the factory, and ruthlessly exposed the illegal acts of illegal capitalists. These two incidents were very educational for those who attended the meeting.

Zhao Tie fu, chairman of the Wuhan Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, said in a report that there are still many capitalists who resist reform. The reason why they dare to do this is mainly because they have the profit-seeking bourgeois nature. However, in the past, trade union organizations and workers in public-private joint ventures emphasized unity with them, while neglecting their reform, which is also a very important reason. Zhao Tie fu called on employees of public-private joint ventures to resolutely oppose various illegal activities of illegal capitalists, comprehensively implement the policy of uniting, educating, and reforming capitalists, and the trade union should strengthen socialist education for workers and prevent the erosion of capitalist ideology on workers.

    提高阶级觉悟　防止资本主义思想侵蚀
    武汉召开合营企业积极分子会议　要求加强合营企业的工会工作
    本报特约新华社武汉电　武汉市工会联合会最近召开了公私合营企业积极分子会议。会议的目的是要求加强公私合营企业的工会工作，教育工人提高阶级觉悟，抵制资产阶级思想的侵蚀。参加会议的有市、区工会组织和公私合营企业的工会干部、积极分子等共一千三百多人。
    会上，工人孙维才、袁斌介绍了自己在党的领导和工人的帮助下，如何战胜了资产阶级思想的侵蚀，从错误的道路上走了回来。公私合营汉阳机器厂的代表介绍了他们厂的工会怎样向职工进行社会主义教育和发动职工向不法资本家作斗争。
    公私合营汉阳机器厂车工孙维才，曾经在不法资本家的利诱下，到“地下工厂”做私活，受了剥削，累坏了身体，白天在厂内干活时打不起精神，影响了生产，后来甚至把公私合营厂内的机器偷出去为资家本干活。工厂的领导上为了教育他和全体工人，专门就干私活问题开展了全厂性的大辩论。很多工人在辩论中指出孙维才是帮助资本家发展资本主义，挖社会主义墙脚。经过几次辩论和党的教育，孙维才认识并改正了自己的错误，生产和学习都有很大的进步。厂内原来很多被不法资本家引诱去干私活的工人，也提高了觉悟，专心在工厂生产。全厂8、9、10月的产值计划都超额完成，改变了过去几个月连续不能完成生产计划的混乱状况。公私合营大力电机厂钳工袁斌因为受资本家的腐蚀，拿过厂内的一些材料、工具，因此，长期以来不敢大胆揭发资本家偷窃国家财产的不法行为。今年8月他在工会的教育下，提高了觉悟，向组织上交代了自己的问题，把所拿的东西交回厂里，并无情地揭发了不法资本家的违法行为。这两件事给到会者以很大的教育。
    武汉市工会联合会主席赵铁夫在会上作报告说，现在还有不少资本家抗拒改造，他们之所以敢于这样，主要是因为他们具有唯利是图的资产阶级本质，但是过去公私合营企业的工会组织、工人对他们强调了团结，而忽视了改造，也是一个很重要的原因。赵铁夫号召公私合营企业的职工坚决反对不法资本家的各种违法行为，全面贯彻团结、教育、改造资本家的政策，工会要加强对工人的社会主义教育，防止资本主义思想对工人的侵蚀。
