    To Lake Baikal
    Hailing
    The waters of Lake Baikal are so blue and deep... The scenery of Lake Baikal is so beautiful and enchanting. The lake reflects the bright and changing colors of the morning glow, like a wonderful fairyland in a fairy tale. Like a group of fairies dancing lightly on the shore, embracing distant friends with passionate power, Baikal, I know you are waving and smiling at me, using the holy water of wisdom to inspire my poetic soul.
    (Note) Let me drink a mouthful of Lake Baikal's morning dew, perhaps I will become more intelligent. You, ancient lake of the Soviets, please tell me about the ancient things you have experienced. Let me drink a mouthful of Lake Baikal's milk, to moisten my dry throat. I will sing out the infinite joy in my heart to my heart's content, because I am now walking on Soviet soil. Let me wash my eyes with the water of Lake Baikal, to make my eyes brighter, so that I can see farther, farther, from the Soviet land to see the future radiance of the new world. Let me wash my chest with the water of Lake Baikal, to make my youthful vitality forever strong, I will shoulder the heavy trust given to me by the people, and march forward to the journey of future life with fighting spirit!
      (Note) Lake Baikal is also known as the Holy Sea

    给贝加尔湖
    海棱贝加尔的湖水是这么蓝而深……贝加尔湖的景色是这么美丽迷人，湖光映着早晨灿烂的变幻的彩霞，就好像童话世界里美妙的仙境。好像一群仙女轻盈地在湖畔舞蹈，用热情的力量拥抱远方的友人，贝加尔呵，我知道你在向我招手微笑，用智慧的圣水启示着我诗的心灵。
  （注）让我饮一口贝加尔湖的朝露，也许我会变得更加聪明，你苏维埃的古老的湖呵，请告诉我你所经历的那些往古的事情。让我饮一口贝加尔湖的奶浆，润一润我干燥的喉咙，我将尽情地唱出心中的无限欢乐，因为我此刻正行走在苏维埃的国土上。让我用贝加尔湖的水洗一洗我的眼睛，使我的眸子变得更加明亮，我将看得更远，更远，从苏维埃的国土看到新世界未来的万丈光芒。让我用贝加尔的湖水洗一洗我的胸膛，使我那青春的活力永远旺盛，我将肩负着人民给我的重托，战斗地向未来的生活的旅程迈进！
      （注）贝加尔湖又称圣海
