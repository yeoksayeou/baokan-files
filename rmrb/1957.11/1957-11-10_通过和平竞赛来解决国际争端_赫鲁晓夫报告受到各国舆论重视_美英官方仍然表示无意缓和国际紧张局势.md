Xinhua News Agency reported: On November 6, Comrade Khrushchev, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the CPSU, delivered a report entitled "The 40th Anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution" at the meeting of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union celebrating the October Revolution Day. In his report, Comrade Khrushchev explicitly put forward the Soviet Union's proposal to ease international tensions, "hoping that capitalist countries and socialist countries will hold high-level talks" and "solve disputes not through war, but through peaceful negotiations, through peaceful competition in developing the economy and culture, and better meeting people's spiritual and material needs." Comrade Khrushchev's proposal has aroused a very profound reaction in many countries.

    Bevan, a left-wing leader of the British Labour Party who is visiting the United States, said on the 6th, "I think that holding a high-level meeting to discuss the benefits of peace is obviously a worthwhile goal, but of course some preparations must be made. I hope this preparatory work can begin."

    British Foreign Secretary Lloyd rejected Khrushchev's proposal for a summit meeting on the 8th. He said in the House of Commons: "A summit meeting would be worse than no meeting if it failed," and he believed that holding such a meeting now was doomed to "failure."

    He added: "This is not to say that we think there should be no meeting." He emphasized that Western countries would first gather their strength, and if a summit meeting were to be held, it must wait until there was "equality of strength."

    The British bourgeois press acknowledged the great achievements of the Soviet Union in the 40 years since its founding and attached importance to Khrushchev's proposal to hold high-level talks. The "Daily Mirror" said in a commentary on the October Revolution Day on the 7th, "Communist Russia is bound to exist as one of the most powerful countries on earth. In some respects, it is even stronger than the United States." This newspaper supports holding summit talks.

    In the face of Khrushchev's proposal to convene a high-level meeting to ease world tensions, the US government once again expressed its unwillingness to resolve issues through negotiations. Secretary of State Dulles said on the 7th that he thought Khrushchev's proposal "seemed very general." He also deliberately said that he did not think Khrushchev's words necessarily referred to a summit meeting between East and West. He refused to hold a meeting between East and West with some irrelevant words, saying, "We already have agreements not to use force to resolve international disputes. I think the existing agreements, if properly implemented, are sufficient. Of course, this is mainly the task of the United Nations."

    State Department spokesman White said that such talks were only desirable "if there is a reasonable basis for expecting that such talks would produce beneficial results." He also said that previous high-level meetings were "disappointing" and stubbornly blamed the Soviet Union.

    Some US officials also said that "the United States will not agree to hold a 'summit' meeting between East and West until the steps to reorganize NATO to adapt it to the new conditions are completed."

    American newspapers, news agencies, radio stations, and television stations paid great attention to Khrushchev's report. "The New York Times" wrote in an editorial that Khrushchev suggested holding a "summit" meeting between East and West "in order to declare war illegal, stop the expansion of armaments, and establish peaceful coexistence on the basis of competition." "The New York Times" said that it can now be said that a new "summit" meeting is welcome. However, this newspaper tried to undermine the great appeal of the Soviet Union's new proposal, insisting that the Soviet Union should be responsible for the current tensions in international relations.

    Many West German newspapers pointed out Khrushchev's proposal for convening a high-level meeting between East and West in their headlines. "Die Welt" emphasized in its Moscow dispatch that Khrushchev's proposal to convene a summit meeting of capitalist and socialist countries "will definitely eliminate international tensions." The newspaper also pointed out the part of Khrushchev's report that was convinced that Soviet industry would definitely catch up with American industry. According to "Deutsche Presse-Agentur": "Social Democratic leaders welcomed the Soviet proposal to convene a new meeting between East and West. These people claimed that in the current serious international situation, all efforts to ease international tensions through negotiations between the political leaders of East and West should be supported."

    Paris newspapers all attached great importance to Khrushchev's report. International political commentators all used Khrushchev's proposal to hold a high-level meeting as the subject of their comments. Some newspapers attempted to find reasons to defend the Western ruling group's behavior of not daring to face the Soviet Union's new peace proposal, saying that this proposal was "unacceptable" to Western countries. "France Soir" acknowledged that Khrushchev's proposal had a "particularly conciliatory tone." But it believes that Western countries cannot hold negotiations. It said, "We cannot agree to hold negotiations when we are at a disadvantage spiritually and diplomatically." The French democratic press mentioned the Soviet Union's consistent and peaceful foreign policy, and pointed out that Western countries should respond to the proposals mentioned in Khrushchev's report.

    The Italian "Unita" also particularly emphasized Khrushchev's proposal for the leaders of countries in the two major camps to hold talks on reaching an agreement on peace issues. This newspaper also paid special attention to the materials quoted by Khrushchev regarding the great achievements made by the Soviet Union in various fields. "Nazione" emphasized that only an agreement reached at a high-level meeting can guarantee the easing of tensions and guarantee peace.

    "Volksstimme" of Austria paid special attention to those paragraphs in Khrushchev's report concerning the international situation and the prospects of the international communist movement.

    When summarizing and publishing Khrushchev's report, Finnish newspapers emphasized the parts about the remarkable achievements of the Soviet regime in the past 40 years, the peaceful foreign policy of socialist countries, and the proposal to compete in launching artificial earth satellites instead of armaments.

    The Urdu daily "Jang" of Pakistan welcomed Khrushchev's proposal in an editorial on the 8th. This newspaper said: "Khrushchev's proposal is very timely and should be welcomed." It said: "After the Soviet Union achieved a historically significant victory in launching outer space rockets and artificial satellites—for this reason, the Soviet Union has certainly become the greatest country in the world—people all over the world expect it to prove that it is demanding peace."

    通过和平竞赛来解决国际争端
    赫鲁晓夫报告受到各国舆论重视
    美英官方仍然表示无意缓和国际紧张局势
    本报综合报道　据新华社消息：11月6日，苏共中央第一书记赫鲁晓夫同志在苏联最高苏维埃庆祝十月革命节大会上作了“伟大的十月社会主义革命四十周年”的报告。赫鲁晓夫同志在报告中曾明确地提出了苏联对和缓国际紧张局势的建议，“希望资本主义国家和社会主义国家举行高级会谈”，“不是通过战争，而是通过和平谈判，通过发展经济、文化和更好地满足人们的精神和物质需求方面的和平竞赛来解决争端”。赫鲁晓夫同志的这一建议在许多国家引起了很深刻的反应。
    正在美国访问的英国工党左翼领袖比万6日说，“我认为，举行高级会议讨论和平的利益，显然是值得希望的目标，但是当然必须要作一些准备。我希望这种准备工作能够着手进行起来。”
    英国外交大臣劳埃德8日拒绝了赫鲁晓夫关于举行最高级会议的建议。他在下议院说：“最高级会议如果失败的话比不举行更糟”，而他认为现在举行这样的会议是注定要“失败”的。
    他又说：“这并不是说我们认为不应当举行会议。”他强调说，西方国家将首先集合它们的力量，如果要举行最高级会议的话，必须等到“势均力敌”的时候才举行。
    英国资产阶级报纸承认苏联建国四十年来取得的伟大成就，并且重视赫鲁晓夫提出的举行高级会谈的主张。“每日镜报”7日在关于十月革命节的评论中说，“共产党俄国势将作为地球上最强大的国家之一存在下去。在某些方面，它甚至比美国更强大。”这家报纸支持召开最高级会谈。
    在赫鲁晓夫的关于召开高级会议来缓和世界紧张局势的建议面前，美国政府又一次表示它不愿意通过谈判来解决问题。国务卿杜勒斯7日说，他认为赫鲁晓夫的建议“似乎很笼统”。他还故意说，他并不认为赫鲁晓夫的话一定是指东西方最高级会议。他用一些不相干的话来拒绝举行一次东西方会议，他说，
  “我们已经有了不使用武力来解决国际纠纷的协定。我认为现有的协议如果加以适当的执行的话，是足够的。当然，这主要是联合国的任务。”
    国务院发言人怀特说，“只有在有相当的理由可以指望这种会谈会产生有益的结果的情况下”，这种会谈才是可取的。他还说从前的高级会议是“令人失望的”，而且硬把责任推在苏联身上。
    美国还有一些官方人士说，“在改组北大西洋公约组织使它适应新条件的步骤完成以前，美国不会赞同举行东西方之间的‘最高级’会议。”
    美国报纸、通讯社、广播电台和电视站非常注意赫鲁晓夫的报告。“纽约时报”的社论写道，赫鲁晓夫建议举行东西方的“最高级”会议，“以便宣布战争为非法，停止扩充军备，在竞赛的基础上建立和平共处”。“纽约时报”说，现在就可以说，举行新的“最高级”会议，是值得欢迎的。可是这家报纸又力图破坏苏联新建议的巨大吸引力，硬说苏联应当对目前国际关系中的紧张局势负责。
    西德许多报纸都在标题中指出了赫鲁晓夫关于召开东西方高级会议的建议。“世界报”在它的莫斯科消息中强调指出，赫鲁晓夫关于召开资本主义国家和社会主义国家最高级会议的建议，
  “一定会消除国际紧张局势”。报纸还指出了赫鲁晓夫报告中关于确信苏联工业一定会赶上美国工业的那一部分。据
  “德意志新闻社”报道：“社会民主党的领导人欢迎苏联关于召开东西方新会议的建议，这些人士声称，在当前严重的国际局势下面，应当支持一切试图通过东西方政治首脑谈判的道路来和缓国际紧张局势的努力。”
    巴黎各报都极为重视赫鲁晓夫的报告。国际政治评论员都以赫鲁晓夫关于举行高级会议的建议作为他们评论的主题。有些报纸企图寻找理由为西方统治集团不敢正视苏联新的和平建议的行为辩护，说什么这个建议对西方国家来说是“不能接受的”。“法兰西晚报”承认赫鲁晓夫的建议具有“特别和解的语气”。但是它却认为，西方国家不能举行谈判。它说，“我们不能同意当我们在精神上和外交上处于失利的时候来举行谈判”。法国民主报纸提到了苏联外交政策始终如一的和平方针，并且指出，西方国家应当回答赫鲁晓夫报告里所提到的建议。
    意大利“团结报”也特别强调指出了赫鲁晓夫关于两大阵营的国家领导人就和平问题达成协议而进行会谈的建议。这家报纸还特别重视赫鲁晓夫所引证的有关苏联在各方面所取得的巨大成就的材料。“国家报”强调指出，只有在高级会议上达成协议，才能保证紧张局势的缓和和保证和平。
    “奥地利人民之声报”特别注意赫鲁晓夫报告中关于国际局势和国际共产主义运动前景的那些段落。
    芬兰报纸在摘要刊载赫鲁晓夫报告时强调指出关于苏维埃政权四十年的卓越成就、社会主义国家的和平外交政策以及主张在发射人造地球卫星方面而不是在军备方面展开竞赛的部分。
    巴基斯坦的乌尔都文日报“战斗报”8日在社论中欢迎赫鲁晓夫的建议。这家报纸说：“赫鲁晓夫的建议非常及时，应当受到欢迎。”它说：“当苏联在发射外层空间火箭和人造卫星方面取得了具有历史意义的胜利以后——由于这个缘故苏联已经肯定地成为世界上最伟大的国家——全世界人民都期待它会证明它是要求和平的。”
