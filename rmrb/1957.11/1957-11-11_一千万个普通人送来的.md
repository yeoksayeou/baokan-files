Stepping into the Lost and Found office in Beijing is truly like entering a well-stocked department store. Two glass display cases are affixed to the wall; one is filled with all kinds of small leather bags, and the other hangs with hundreds of pairs of glasses. Several bookshelves in the center of the room are also full, stacked with bundles of colorful sweaters, woolen clothes, scarves, gloves... We heard a soft rustling sound coming from a cabinet, and it turned out to be over four hundred ticking watches inside. Another cabinet holds fountain pens, with more than ten brands and around six thousand pieces. In fact, these items displayed outside are only a small part of the lost property; the Lost and Found staff broadly categorize all items awaiting collection into forty major categories. If calculated by the number of owners, they belong to approximately thirty thousand careless individuals.

Where did such a large number of lost items come from? The answer is: from the hands of millions of ordinary people. People initially send them to the Lost and Found departments in various streets or public places, and if no one claims them within ten days, they are then transferred to this central Lost and Found office. If someone asks: why did some people in the past treat found items as their unexpected gains, but today they can proactively return them to others? The answer is simple: this is a new social ethos. An ordinary pedicab driver can consciously send hundreds of yuan of banknotes left in his car by passengers to the nearby public security police station; an ordinary tram (or bus) conductor can consciously send the gold jewelry lost by passengers to the tram (or bus) company; a child who has just entered primary school can hand over a fountain pen found on the road to the police officer on duty... And these finders often don't even want to leave their names, making it impossible for the losers to express their gratitude to them. This is the general public's ethos.

Lost items from all directions are sent to the Lost and Found office, bringing heavy responsibilities to the staff responsible for the Lost and Found work. In order to prevent some clothes from being moth-eaten, they must be frequently aired; to prevent watches from rusting, they must be wound every day; some equipment also needs to be cleaned regularly. However, these are all relatively easy to do. The most difficult task is to find the original owners of these lost items one by one.

If the losers can proactively search, the problem will naturally be solved. Otherwise, the Lost and Found staff can only painstakingly explore the whereabouts of the loser, layer by layer, based on the time and place of the pick-up and the characteristics of the item. It is because of this that in the Lost and Found office, you can see some staff members shouting themselves hoarse by the telephone, and you can see them frowning over how to deduce the location of the loser of an item. It is also because of this that you can see how happy they are when they return a lost item to its owner!

Here is an example. In April of this year, Wang Lin, a small merchant from a foreign county, lost a pocket containing more than two hundred yuan in cash in Qianmen. The loser's anxious mood need not be elaborated. However, at this time, Ma Rongxiu, a staff member responsible for the Lost and Found, was also sitting there blankly, feeling anxious. Because when he opened the money bag, he found that it was full of bundles of small receipts. Experience in handling such matters told him that it was lost by a small rural peddler. So he worriedly asked himself: "A rural person is unfamiliar with the city. What if he doesn't know how to search? What if he has lost confidence and left Beijing in despair? What can be done to find this loser?" The result, of course, was that the loser found the Lost and Found office, and Ma Rongxiu was relieved of a heavy burden.

There are also many losers who have not had time to search for themselves, but the Lost and Found office returned the lost items to them. Miao Yanxiu, a designer at the Beijing Basic Chemical Design Institute, was one of them. This female technician lost a salary she had just received. The salary bag only had her position and name, but no organization name. After receiving the money, the Lost and Found office had no choice but to visit the household registration units of all nearby industrial organizations to inquire, and finally found the female technician's address. Therefore, when she received her salary bag again, she praised the work of the Lost and Found office repeatedly, feeling both grateful and surprised. (Attached picture)

    一千万个普通人送来的
    千峰
    走进北京市的失物招领处，真像到了一所种类齐全的百货店。贴墙两面玻璃橱，一面摆着各式各样的小皮包，另一面悬挂着上百副眼镜。屋子正中几只书架也被占满了，那是成捆的五颜六色的毛衣、绒衣、围巾、手套……。我们听到在一只柜子里发出嘈嘈??的细响，原来里面放着四百多块正在走动着的手表。还有一只柜子放着自来水笔，光牌号就有十几种，支数约在六千以上。其实这些陈列在外面的东西只不过是招领物的一小部分，招领处的工作人员把所有正在等待招领的物品概括地分为四十大类。如果以失主为单位计算，它们大约属于三万个粗心大意的主人。
    这样多的遗失物品是从哪里汇集来的？回答是：从千千万万个普通人民手里。人们最初先把它送到各个街道或是公共场所的失物招领部门，如果在十天内没有人领取，然后就转送到这个总的招领处。如果有人要问：为什么过去有的人把拾到的东西当作自己的意外收获，而今天就能够主动地去送还别人？回答很简单，这是一种新的社会风尚。一个普通的三轮车夫，他可以把乘客丢在车上的几百元钞票自觉地送到附近公安派出所；一个普通的电车（或汽车）售票员，他可以自觉地把乘客遗失的金饰品送到电车（或汽车）公司；一个刚入小学的儿童，他可以把在马路上拾到的自来水笔交给站岗的警察叔叔……。而这些拣拾者往往连名字都不愿留，以致失主要想向他们表示谢意都不可能。这就是一般人们的风尚。
    四面八方的失物被送到招领处里，它们给负责招领工作的人员带来了繁重的责任。为了使得有些衣物不被虫蛀，就要经常翻晒；为了避免钟表生锈，就要天天上弦；有些器械还需要经常擦洗。然而这些都还容易办到，最困难的是要为这些失物一一找到原主。
    如果失主能够主动去查找，问题自然就解决了。否则，失物招领处的工作人员就只有根据拣拾的时间、地点以及物品的特征，一层一层艰苦地探求那个失主的踪迹了。正是因为这样，在招领处里，你可以看到有的工作人员在电话机旁喊哑了嗓子，你可以看到他们为推敲一件物品的失主的所在地区而愁眉不展。也正因为这样，你也可以看到当他们把一件失物归还原主的时候是多么高兴！
    这里不妨举一个例子。今年4月间，一个外县小商人王林，在前门失落了一只装着二百多元现金的口袋。失主的焦急心情自然不必细说。然而就在这时，一个负责失物招领的工作人员马荣秀也正呆呆地坐在那里发急。因为他打开的这个钱袋，发现里边装的尽是一捆捆的小票，处理这类事情的经验告诉他，这是一个乡下小商贩丢的。于是他在担心地追问着自己：“一个乡下人到了城里人地生疏，如果不知道查找怎么办呢？如果他已经失去信心而绝望地离开了北京又怎么办呢？用什么办法才能找到这个失主呢？”结果当然是那个失主找到了失物招领处，马荣秀才卸下了一块千斤重的石头。
    也有许多失主是自己还没有来得及寻找，而由招领处把遗失的东西送还给他的。北京基本化学设计院设计员苗延秀就是这样的。这个女技术员丢掉了刚刚领到的一份薪金。薪金袋上只有职务和姓名，而没有机关名称。招领处收到这笔钱以后，只好到所有临近的工业机关的户籍单位去查访，最后终于找到了女技术员的住址。因此当她重新拿到自己的薪金袋的时候，口口称道招领处的工作，使她又感激又惊奇。（附图片）
