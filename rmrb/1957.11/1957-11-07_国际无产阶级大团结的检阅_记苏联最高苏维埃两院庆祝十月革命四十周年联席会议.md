    The meeting of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union celebrating the 40th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution was held on the 6th in the Luzhniki Palace of Sports. This was a summary meeting of the Soviet Union's forty years of brilliant achievements, and a proletarian unity meeting centered on the Soviet Union, holding high the red flag of the great October Revolution.
    The Luzhniki Palace of Sports is where Premier Zhou and the children celebrated the Fir Tree Festival this January. Today it has become a spacious conference hall. The original artificial ice rink in the center of the hall is now covered with carpets and seats for the deputies of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. The Soviet flag and the flags of the fifteen republics hang in the center of the ceiling. The Soviet emblem and the emblems of the fifteen republics are hung around the ceiling. The red flags and flowers behind the rostrum set off the portrait of Lenin. The lights at the top of the rostrum are woven into the words "1917-1957" and "Long live the 40th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution." Today, about 15,000 people are participating in this grand event.
    Here are the representatives of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, the responsible personnel of the Communist Party and government of the Soviet Union, and representatives from all walks of life in the Soviet Union. In addition to the hosts, there are delegations from the parties and governments of all socialist countries, representatives from fraternal communist and workers' parties from sixty-one countries, and representatives from many important people's organizations in the world. Important envoys of the world's proletariat gathered together. Seeing these figures on such a commemorative day, one cannot help but think about how deeply the ideas of Marxism-Leninism have penetrated the hearts of the people and the vigorous development of the international communist movement. When Lenin's Marxist group was active in St. Petersburg, although the Russian ruling class feared it more than fire, they never imagined that this spark would burn down the Russian capitalist system. When the sound of the guns of the cruiser "Aurora" shook the world, although the international reactionary class was very shocked, they never imagined that this roaring cannon was proclaiming the beginning of the demise of the capitalist world and the rise of the socialist world. No matter how frantically the international bourgeoisie tries to prevent the train of human history from advancing along the road of the October Revolution, they will be in vain. Look, on the eve of the October Revolution, there were no more than 250,000 communists in Russia, and now the total number of communists in the world has exceeded 33 million. The communist and workers' parties of thirteen socialist countries have become ruling parties. There are communist parties in sixty-two capitalist countries, with a total of about 4.55 million members. When the October Revolution had just won, there was only one socialist country, and now the territory of various socialist countries has accounted for more than a quarter of the world, the population has accounted for more than a third of the world, and the industrial output has accounted for about a third of the world. The gathering of so many leading figures and representatives here today is a manifestation of the prosperity of the cause of the working class and the cause of communism, and a sign of the victorious development of the new era opened up by the October Revolution—a new era of destroying capitalism and establishing socialism.
    At ten o'clock, Comrades Khrushchev and Voroshilov, together with Chairman Mao and Vice-Chairman Song Qingling, appeared on the rostrum. Comrades Bulganin, Mikoyan, and other members of the Presidium of the CPSU Central Committee, and Comrade Deng Xiaoping and leaders of fraternal parties from various countries entered the presidium. The audience stood up and applauded warmly. Khrushchev and Chairman Mao and Vice-Chairman Song Qingling sat in a row.
    Presided over by Lobanov, Chairman of the Union Council of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, the celebration meeting first listened to Khrushchev's report "Forty Years of the Great October Socialist Revolution." When Comrade Khrushchev announced that the Chinese delegation led by Comrade Mao Zedong was attending the meeting, the audience stood up and applauded for a long time. Khrushchev introduced the delegations of fraternal parties one by one. Each time a delegation was announced, the audience burst into warm applause. At this moment, the whole venue was filled with an atmosphere of proletarian internationalism.
    Comrade Khrushchev's report lasted three and a half hours. The participants listened attentively to his report and applauded constantly. Comrade Khrushchev pointed out that the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution is a festival of the victory of socialism in the Soviet Union and an international festival for the working people of the world. He said that on the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution, the people of all nationalities in the Soviet Union showed to all mankind the historically significant victory of socialism. Our working class has always regarded itself as a force in the international workers' movement, and it regards its achievements as the victory of the working people of all countries, as its contribution to the great cause of liberating mankind from the shackles of imperialism and colonialism, and to the cause of building a new socialist society. Comrade Khrushchev briefly reviewed the history of the Soviet people, under the leadership of the Communist Party and with the support of the working classes and working people of all countries, waging heroic struggles and arduous struggles to open up a brand-new road for mankind. He cited the facts of the Soviet people and the working people of the world uniting and helping each other. He said that the Soviet people have felt in the past and still feel the friendly and fraternal support of the international proletariat and the tens of millions of working people around the world. Our country was the first to break through the front line of imperialism in 1917. Later, it built socialism and crushed the Hitler military machine, thereby gloriously fulfilling its internationalist responsibility to the working people of all countries, to the international communist and workers' movement, and to all progressive forces in the world. Comrade Khrushchev pointed out in a happy tone that socialism has developed from the initial victory in the Soviet Union to a powerful world system. He said: We feel happy and joyful that there are 600 million Chinese people marching forward shoulder to shoulder with the Soviet people, led by their glorious Communist Party, and that there are working people in various countries building socialism under the leadership of their Communist and Workers' Parties. In his report, Comrade Khrushchev repeatedly mentioned the Communist Party and the people of China and other people's democratic countries in building socialism. Whenever these places were mentioned, there was continuous applause in the venue. This reflects the great concern of the Communist Party and the people of the Soviet Union for the unity of the international proletariat and working people.
    Comrade Khrushchev summarized the achievements of the Soviet Union over the past forty years. He said that the entire experience of the Soviet state over the past forty years tells us that without a unified party as solid as a rock, without a party armed with the knowledge of the laws of social development, without a party loyal to the great principles of Leninism, our working class and laboring peasants, as well as our people across the country, could not have seized power, could not have defeated their enemies, could not have built a socialist society, and could not have successfully and gradually transitioned to a communist society.
    Comrade Khrushchev then talked about the prospects and tasks of the Soviet communist construction. He said that now that the Soviet Union has made outstanding achievements in national economy, science and technology, and cultural development for forty years and has built a socialist society, we have every reason to say that communism is no longer a distant future. It is becoming clearer and clearer to the people of all nationalities like a magnificent building. This building is developing and growing, and will become more and more perfect in form with every labor achievement gained by the workers, peasants, and intellectuals of our multi-ethnic country.
    Comrade Khrushchev described the international significance of the October Revolution and the growth of world socialist forces. He said that the socialist world system has strong economic, political, and military resources. No matter how rampant the imperialists are, they cannot defeat the growing power of the socialist world system. They cannot stop the movement of society toward communism. Comrade Khrushchev said that today hundreds of millions of people are advancing under the banner of Marxism-Leninism. Tomorrow, tens of millions of workers will stand under the invincible banner.
    After Comrade Khrushchev finished his report, the audience stood up and applauded continuously. When he returned to his seat, Chairman Mao shook hands with him tightly to express his congratulations.
    The celebration meeting continued at 4 pm. When Comrade Khrushchev and Chairman Mao appeared on the rostrum hand in hand, the audience applauded warmly for a long time. Razis, Chairman of the National Council of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, announced that Chairman Mao Zedong, head of the Chinese delegation, would speak, and the audience stood up unanimously. Chairman Mao walked to the podium amidst applause. He first extended warm fraternal congratulations on behalf of the National People's Congress, the State Council, the Communist Party of China, and the people and all party members of China to the great Soviet people, government, and party. Chairman Mao pointed out the great achievements of the October Revolution over the past forty years, saying that it is not only the pride of the Soviet people, but also the pride of the world proletariat and the pride of all mankind. Chairman Mao also pointed out that the road of the October Revolution is fundamentally the common bright road for the development of all mankind. He said that it is equally clear that after the October Revolution, any government that refuses to live in friendship with the Soviet Union can only harm the true interests of its own people. After Chairman Mao expressed his heartfelt thanks on behalf of the Chinese people for the great assistance given to our country by the Soviet Union, he said that we share the same destiny and breathe the same air with the Soviet Union and the entire socialist camp. We believe that strengthening the unity of the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union is the sacred international obligation of all socialist countries. Finally, Chairman Mao shouted: "Long live the great October Socialist Revolution!" "Long live the unity and friendship of the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union!" "Long live the great internationalist banner of Marxism-Leninism!" "Workers of all countries and peace-loving people of the world, unite!" Chairman Mao's speech was repeatedly greeted with warm applause from the audience.
    Then, Comrade Gomulka of Poland, Comrade Novotny of Czechoslovakia, Comrade Ulbricht of the German Democratic Republic, Comrade Stoica of Romania, and Comrade Zhivkov of Bulgaria spoke successively, unanimously congratulating the 40th anniversary of the Great October Revolution, emphasizing the great historical significance of the October Revolution, and expressing their desire to strengthen the unity of socialist countries. At today's meeting, Comrade Kardelj of Yugoslavia, Comrade Kadar of Hungary, Comrade Ho Chi Minh of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Comrade Kim Il-sung of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Comrade Hoxha of Albania, and Comrade Damba of the Mongolian People's Republic continued to speak. The celebration meeting will finally pass a letter to the Soviet people and a letter to the people of the world.

    国际无产阶级大团结的检阅
    ——记苏联最高苏维埃两院庆祝十月革命四十周年联席会议
    本报驻莫斯科记者集体采写
    苏联最高苏维埃庆祝伟大十月社会主义革命四十周年会议6日在卢日尼基体育宫里举行。这是苏联四十年辉煌成就的总结大会，这是高举着伟大的十月的红旗的以苏联为中心的无产阶级团结大会。
    卢日尼基体育宫是今年1月周总理和孩子们欢度枞树节的地方。今天变成一座宽敞的会议厅。大厅中央原来的人工的滑冰场现在铺着地毯，摆着苏联最高苏维埃代表的席位，顶棚中心悬着苏联国旗和十五个加盟共和国的国旗。顶棚四周挂着苏联的国徽和十五个加盟共和国的国徽。主席台的背后招展着的红旗和花朵衬托着列宁的肖像。主席台楣端的灯光织成了“1917—1957”和“伟大的十月社会主义革命四十周年万岁”的字样。今天，约有一万五千人参加这个盛会。
    这里有苏联最高苏维埃的代表、苏联共产党和政府的负责工作人员和苏联社会各界代表。除了主人以外，这里有所有社会主义国家的党和政府代表团，有六十一个国家的兄弟共产党和工人党的代表，有世界许多重要的人民团体的代表，全世界无产阶级的重要使者们聚集一堂，在这样的纪念日看到了这些人物，人们不能不联想到马克思列宁主义的思想多么深入人心和国际共产主义运动的蓬勃发展。当列宁领导的马克思主义小组在彼得堡进行活动的时候，俄国统治阶级虽然怕它甚于怕火，但是他们那里想得到这星星之火竟然会烧掉俄国资本主义制度。在“阿芙乐尔”巡洋舰的炮声震撼世界的时候，国际反动阶级虽然非常震惊，但是他们那里想到这轰轰的大炮竟然是宣告资本主义世界开始灭亡和社会主义世界开始兴起的号角。不论国际资产阶级怎样疯狂地阻挡人类历史的列车沿着十月革命的道路前进，他们都是枉然。看吧，在十月革命前夜，俄国的共产党员才不超过二十五万人，而现在世界各国的共产党员总数已经超过三千三百万人，十三个社会主义国家的共产党和工人党已经成为执政党。在六十二个资本主义国家里已经有了共产党，党员共约四百五十五万人，在十月革命刚胜利的时候，只有一个社会主义国家，而现在各个社会主义国家的领土已经占世界四分之一以上，人口已经占全世界三分之一以上，工业产量约占全世界的三分之一。今天在这里聚集这样多的领袖人物和代表人物，这正是工人阶级事业和共产主义事业兴旺发达的表现，这是十月革命所开辟的新纪元——破资本主义立社会主义的新纪元——的胜利地发展的标志。
    十点钟，赫鲁晓夫同志、伏罗希洛夫同志和毛主席、宋庆龄副委员长一起出现在主席台上，随着布尔加宁同志、米高扬同志和其他苏共中央主席团委员，邓小平同志及各国兄弟党的领导人员进入主席团。全场起立，热烈鼓掌。赫鲁晓夫和毛主席、宋庆龄副委员长坐在一排。
    在苏联最高苏维埃联盟院主席洛巴诺夫主持下，庆祝会议首先听取了赫鲁晓夫“伟大的十月社会主义革命四十年”的报告。当赫鲁晓夫同志宣布有毛泽东同志率领的中国代表团出席会议时，全场起立经久不息地鼓掌欢迎。赫鲁晓夫一一介绍各国兄弟党代表团。每当宣布一个代表团时，全场就爆发一阵阵热烈的掌声。在这个时刻，全场洋溢着无产阶级国际主义气氛。
    赫鲁晓夫同志的报告长达三个半小时，参加会议的人聚精会神地聆听他的报告，总是不断地鼓掌。赫鲁晓夫同志指出，十月革命四十周年是社会主义在苏联取得胜利的节日，是全世界劳动者的国际节日。他说，在十月革命四十周年的时候，苏联各族人民向全人类展示具有历史意义的社会主义的胜利。我国工人阶级一向把自己看作是国际工人运动的一支队伍，它把自己的成就看作是各国劳动者的胜利，是自己对人类摆脱帝国主义和殖民主义枷锁的伟大解放事业，是对新的社会主义社会的建设事业的贡献。赫鲁晓夫同志简短地回顾了苏联人民在共产党的领导下，在各国工人阶级和劳动人民的支援下进行英勇斗争和艰苦斗争、为人类开辟一条崭新的道路的历史。他举出了苏联人民和世界劳动人民的团结互助的事实。他说，苏联人民过去和现在都感觉到国际无产阶级、全世界千千万万劳动人民友好的兄弟般的支持。我国在1917年第一个突破了帝国主义的战线，后来建成了社会主义，粉碎了希特勒军事机器，从而光荣地尽了对各国劳动者、对国际共产主义和工人运动、对世界上一切进步力量的国际主义的责任。赫鲁晓夫同志用高兴的声调着重指出社会主义已经从最初苏联一个国家取得胜利，发展成为强大的世界体系。他说：我们感到幸福和愉快，为现在和苏联人民并肩前进的有自己光荣的共产党领导的六亿中国人民、有在自己的共产党和工人党领导下建设社会主义的各国劳动者。赫鲁晓夫同志在他的报告中曾经多次提到在建设社会主义的中国和其他人民民主国家的共产党和人民。每逢谈到这些地方，就引起场内的不断掌声。这反映了苏联共产党和人民对国际无产阶级和劳动人民的团结的巨大关怀。
    赫鲁晓夫同志对苏联四十年来的成就作了总结。他说苏维埃国家的四十年的全部经验告诉我们说，如果没有一个统一的、像磐石般团结一致的党，如果没有一个以社会发展规律知识武装起来的党，如果没有一个忠实于列宁主义的伟大原则的党，那么我国工人阶级和劳动农民以及我们全国人民是不能取得政权的，是不能击溃自己的敌人的，是不能建成社会主义社会和胜利地逐步过渡到共产主义社会的。
    赫鲁晓夫同志接着谈到苏联共产主义建设的远景和任务，他说，现在当苏联四十年来在国民经济、科学技术和文化发展方面取得卓越成绩并建成了社会主义社会的时候，我们有一切理由说，共产主义已经不是遥远的未来。它像是一座雄伟壮丽的大厦越来越清楚地呈现在各族人民的面前。这座大厦正在发展壮大，并将随着我们多民族的国家的工人、农民和知识分子所获得的每一个劳动成就越来越具有更加完美的形式。
    赫鲁晓夫同志描述了十月革命的国际意义和世界社会主义力量增长的情况，他说，社会主义世界体系拥有强大的经济、政治力量和军事资源。帝国主义者不论怎样猖狂，他们都不能挫败社会主义世界体系日益增长的力量。他们都不能制止社会向共产主义前进的运动。赫鲁晓夫同志说，今天数亿人民都在马克思列宁主义的旗帜下前进。明天又会有成万万劳动者站到前面无往不胜的旗帜下面来。
    赫鲁晓夫同志作完报告以后，全场起立不断鼓掌。当他回到坐位的时候，毛主席同他紧紧地握手，表示祝贺。
    庆祝会议下午四时继续举行，赫鲁晓夫同志和毛主席手携手出现在主席台上的时候，全场长时间的热烈鼓掌。苏联最高苏维埃民族院主席拉齐斯宣布中国代表团团长毛泽东主席讲话，这时全场一致起立。毛主席在一片掌声中走上讲台，他首先代表我国全国人民代表大会、国务院、中国共产党，代表我国全国人民和全体党员向伟大的苏联人民、政府和党致热烈的兄弟般的祝贺。毛主席指出了十月革命四十年的伟大成就说，它不但是苏联人民的骄傲，而且是全世界无产阶级的骄傲，全人类的骄傲。毛主席并且指出，十月革命的道路从根本上说来是全人类发展的共同的光明大道，他说，同样很明显，在十月革命以后，任何一个国家的政府，如果拒绝同苏联友好相处，那就只能损害本国人民的真正利益。毛主席在代表中国人民对苏联给与我国的伟大援助表示衷心的感谢之后说，我们同苏联和整个社会主义阵营共命运，同呼吸。我们认为增强以苏联为首的社会主义国家的团结是一切社会主义国家的神圣的国际义务。最后，毛主席高呼：“伟大的十月社会主义革命万岁！”“以苏联为首的社会主义各国的团结和友谊万岁！”“马克思列宁主义伟大的国际主义旗帜万岁！”“全世界无产者和爱好和平的人民联合起来！”毛主席的讲话一再得到全场热烈的掌声。
    接着波兰的哥穆尔卡同志，捷克斯洛伐克的诺沃提尼同志，德意志民主共和国的乌布利希同志，罗马尼亚的斯托伊卡同志，保加利亚的日夫科夫同志相继讲话，一致祝贺伟大十月革命四十周年，强调了十月革命的伟大历史意义，并且表示了加强社会主义各国团结的愿望。在今天的大会上，继续讲话的还有南斯拉夫的卡德尔同志，匈牙利的卡达尔同志，越南民主共和国的胡志明同志，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的金日成同志，阿尔巴尼亚的霍查同志，蒙古人民共和国的达姆巴同志。庆祝大会最后将通过致苏联人民书和致世界人民书。
