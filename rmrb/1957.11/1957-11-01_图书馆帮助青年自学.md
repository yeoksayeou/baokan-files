Libraries Help Young People Study Independently

    (Our report) Beijing's libraries are actively helping middle and primary school graduates who did not continue their education this year to study independently. Since August, the libraries have been issuing library cards to these young people and lending them books. The Children's Library normally opens at 10:00 AM, but for these self-studying young people, it opens at 8:00 AM every day, and there are often fifteen young people studying there. The Dongdan District Library also provides guidance on borrowing books to these young people, recommending reference books based on the courses they are studying. To meet the needs of young people studying independently, many libraries have increased their collection of books on mathematics and science. Currently, the number of young people going to the library to borrow books is increasing daily. The Dongsi District Library has the most borrowers, with fifty to sixty people on some days. According to the requests of the self-studying young people, the libraries are trying to purchase more self-study reference books and prepare reading rooms for them whenever possible. The Dongdan District Library plans to investigate the number and needs of self-studying young people in the district to strengthen this work.

    图书馆帮助青年自学
    本报讯　北京市各图书馆积极帮助今年没有升学的中小学毕业生自学。从8月份起，各图书馆相继给自学青年发了借书证，借给他们图书。儿童图书馆平日规定上午十时开馆，但对自学青年，每天从八时起就开馆，经常有十五个青年去那里自学。东单区图书馆对自学青年还进行了借书的辅导工作，根据借书人自学的课程，向他们推荐参考书。很多图书馆为了满足青年自学的要求，已经增加了数理方面的书籍。目前，自学青年到图书馆借书的一天天地多起来，到东四区图书馆借书的最多的一天已有五六十人。各图书馆根据自学青年的要求，在可能的情况下，正设法增购自学参考书和为他们准备阅览室。东单区图书馆计划调查全区自学青年的人数和要求，以便加强这方面的工作。
