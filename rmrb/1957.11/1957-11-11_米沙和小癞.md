    Misha and Little Lai
    Yang Jie
    The Soviet expert's wife and son from the exploration team also came. It was at dusk when I had just finished calculating the double difference problem. Wu Little Lai from next door shouted all the way from the village entrance: "Come and see the Soviet child, red hair, he's coming into the village." I hurried out. That child was Misha. Blue eyes, light red hair, tall, but wearing a red scarf. He was holding some boxes in one hand and pulling his mother with the other. When he saw us, he walked and smiled, waving and saying in Chinese: "Hello, Chinese friends!" All the children in the yard crowded around the roadside, curiously looking at him, but none of them came forward to greet him. Misha followed his mother, accompanied by the agricultural cooperative's chairman, Uncle Li, to the Li family compound where the exploration team lived.
    All the children in the yard gathered at my house as usual that evening. Everyone talked about him with great interest. "So spirited! Walking with a 'clop, clop, clop' sound." "And so polite!" "Yes, why didn't we say hello to him too?" Only Wu Little Lai stood aside, wiping his nose and saying, "What's so great about him? Hmph, a head of red hair!" Little Lai was a notorious "troublemaker," always arguing with people. This time, he provoked public anger. "Insulting a Soviet friend, outrageous!" People swarmed around him, some pointing at his nose, some tugging at his clothes, insisting that he confess his guilt. Little Lai's face turned red instantly. He stammered a few words, broke free from the encirclement, and hurried back to his room.
    The next day was Sunday, and Misha came to our yard to play alone. To everyone's surprise, he knew a lot of Chinese, though not very fluently. The children naturally surrounded him at my house again, asking this and that. He said he was thirteen years old, in the seventh grade, and had come to China with his father in 1949. To help China's construction, his father had repeatedly postponed his return to his country. He also told us about school life in the Soviet Union, mixing Chinese with Soviet words, and gesturing incessantly. The house was filled with his hearty laughter, which was extremely interesting. Later, I pointed to Little Lai, who was standing by the side door, and said to him: "Last night, he called you red hair!" Misha didn't understand, but Little Lai glared at me resentfully and left.
    One day, I took Misha to visit the agricultural cooperative's livestock shed. On the way home, a stone suddenly flew from behind a jujube tree and nearly hit my head. Looking closely, a figure flashed from behind the jujube tree into the vegetable garden. Wasn't that the "troublemaker"! I was furious and urged Misha, "Quick, chase him, that's Little Lai, who often scolds you." Misha smiled and chased after him. I went around to the other side, just in time to block Little Lai on the ridge of the vegetable garden's fish pond. "See where you're running, you little troublemaker!" Misha also shouted with a smile: "Your sur-ren-der, sur-ren-der!"
    Little Lai stood in the middle of the pond ridge, silent. After a moment of stalemate, he rushed towards me with all his might. Unexpectedly, he stepped on the grass on the edge of the ridge, slipped, tumbled, and rolled down the ridge. I panicked, and Misha was also stunned. At this time, the pond water was deep, Little Lai sank and floated again, cried once, took a sip of water, and sank again. I quickly shouted loudly, "Come and save him, Little Lai fell into the pond." But there were no adults around. Misha looked at me and then at Little Lai, and resolutely said: "Don't worry, don't worry!" Without even taking off his clothes, he jumped into the water. I was so frightened that I stood there like a fool, watching him swim close to Little Lai in a few strokes, and then watching him drag Little Lai to the shore. It took me a long time to come to my senses and help pull Little Lai onto the ridge.
    Little Lai came up, spat out a few mouthfuls of water, and cried loudly, mixed with scolding me. I saw Misha dripping wet, his lips frozen purple, and his face frozen white. But he only cared about comforting Little Lai: "Don't cry, you'll be all right..."
    When I sent Little Lai home, I was naturally scolded by my mother. Then I sent Misha back. His mother was very surprised to see him soaking wet. Misha told her what happened, and she laughed.
    The next day, Misha came running over, full of energy, and took me to see Little Lai. Little Lai was scolded when he came back, slept for a night, and was fine. I asked Little Lai: "Why did you scold Misha? Look how good Misha is, without him, you would have drowned." His face turned red, and he lowered his head, only caring about rolling the corner of his clothes.
    From that day on, when Misha came to the yard to play, he would always stop by Little Lai's house. He saw that Little Lai had a head of sores, and took some ointment and gauze from his mother to change his dressings every day, as carefully as his own brother. This continued until early November, when Misha was about to return to Guangzhou with his mother, and we reluctantly parted.
    ...Now in my hometown, tungsten mines and coal seams that were never known to anyone have been mined in large quantities. This often makes me gratefully think of Misha's father. As for Wu Little Lai, his sores have been cured, and he and I are studying in the same school. I am in the first year of high school, and he is in the second year of junior high school.

    米沙和小癞
    杨杰
    勘探队里苏联专家的爱人、儿子也来了。是黄昏时分，我刚做完倍差问题的演算。隔壁吴小癞从村口一路嚷进来：“快来看苏联小孩，红头发，进村来了。”我忙出来。那个小孩就是米沙。碧蓝的眼睛，淡红的头发，个子很高却系条红领巾。他一手拿些盒儿，一手拉着妈妈。看到我们，就一面走一面笑着招手，用中国话说：“中国朋友，你们好！”院子所有的小孩都挤挤碰碰地围在路旁，好奇地瞅他，却没一个上前去跟他招呼。米沙就这么跟着妈妈，由农业社社长李伯伯陪着，上勘探队住的李家大院去了。
    整个晚上，院里的小孩都像平常一样聚在我家。大家兴致勃勃地谈他。“多精神啊！走路壳壳壳的。”“还很有礼貌哪！”“是呀，我们为啥不也向他问好呢？”只有吴小癞一个人，在旁边抹着鼻涕说：“有啥了不起？哼，一头红毛！”小癞是有名的“胡捣蛋”，专和人抬杠。这次可激起了众怒。“侮辱苏联朋友，岂有此理！”人们一窝蜂围了上去，有的指着他鼻子，有的就扯他衣襟，非逼他认罪不可。小癞唰的红了脸。支吾两句，挣脱包围，就慌慌张张地回屋去了。
    第二天是星期日，米沙一个人到我们院子来玩。使大家惊奇的是，他竟懂很多中国话，虽然不太熟练。孩子们又自然地把他围到我家里，问这问那。他说他十三岁，读七年级，1949年就随爸爸来到中国。为了帮助中国建设，他爸爸一再推迟了回国的日期。他又跟我们讲苏联的学校生活，中国话夹着苏联话，还不住地比手势。屋里响着他爽朗的笑声，有趣极了。后来，我指着傍门站着的小癞跟他说：“昨晚，他骂你红毛呢！”米沙没听懂，小癞却恨恨地白我一眼，走了。
    有一天，我带米沙参观农业社的牲畜棚，回家路上，突然从一棵枣树后对着我飞来块石子，险些打中我的头。定睛一看，一个人影一晃就从枣树后溜进菜园了。那不正是“胡捣蛋”吗！我气极了，怂恿米沙说：“快追，那就是常常骂你的小癞。”米沙笑了笑，追上去。我就绕向另一边，恰好把小癞堵在菜园的鱼塘塍上。“看你朝哪儿跑，你个胡捣蛋！”米沙也笑着嚷：“你的透（投）降，透降！”
    小癞站在塘塍中间，却不吱声，僵持了一忽儿，他一个猛劲就朝我这儿冲。不想一脚踩到塘边草上，脚一滑，一跟斗栽倒，并且顺着塘塍滚下去。我吓慌了，米沙也惊呆了。这时节塘水正深，小癞沉下去又浮上来，哭一声，喝口水，又沉下去了。我连忙大声喊：“快来救啊，小癞掉到塘里了。”可是周围没一个大人。米沙看看我又看看小癞，毅然说：“不忙，不忙！”连衣服也不脱，纵身一跳，就到了水里。我吓得傻瓜似的，呆呆看着他三划两划划近小癞，又看着他把小癞拖到岸边。好久，我才清醒过来，拢去帮着把小癞拉上塘塍。
    小癞上来吐了几口水，就一股劲“哇哇”地哭，还夹杂着骂我。我看米沙一身水直往下淋，嘴唇冻乌了，脸也冻白了。他却只顾安慰小癞：“不哭，你大大好的……”
    送小癞回家，我自然挨妈妈一顿骂。我又送米沙回去。他妈看到他湿漉漉一身，很惊讶。米沙把这事一说，她却笑了。
    下一天，米沙又活蹦活跳地跑来，还拉我去看小癞。小癞回来挨了顿骂，睡一宿，也就没事了。我问小癞：“你为啥要骂米沙？你看米沙多好，没有他，你早淹死了。”他涨红了脸，低着头只顾卷衣角。
    从这天起，米沙来院子里玩时，也总要到小癞家转一转。他看小癞一头癞疮，又从妈妈那儿拿些药膏、纱布，每天给他换药，细心得像他的亲哥哥。这样一直到11月初，米沙要跟妈妈回广州了，我们才依依不舍地分手。
    ……现在在我的家乡，从来无人知晓的钨矿、煤层，已经被大量挖出来。这常使我感激地想起米沙的爸爸。吴小癞呢，癞疮治好了，正和我在一个学校念书，我读高中一，他读初中二了。
