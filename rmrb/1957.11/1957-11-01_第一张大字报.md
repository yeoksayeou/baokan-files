    The First Big-Character Poster
    In May, on the very first day the rectification campaign began at the Beijing Institute of Aeronautics, before the 3303 class even had a chance to hear the mobilization report, they posted the first big-character poster – “A Message to All Students of the Institute.” The big-character poster used the most vicious language to attack the Party and the socialist system, igniting the first fire in the school.
    Four months later, the anti-Rightist struggle has been victorious, and the rectification has entered the work improvement phase. The Party is again calling for bold airing of views and active suggestions. After several months of training, the students know that they were fooled by the Rightists in the past. On the morning of the second day of the mobilization meeting, the young men of the 3303 class again posted the first big-character poster. They raised more than thirty suggestions for the school leadership. The difference is that no more vicious language can be found in the big-character poster.

    第一张大字报
    5月里，北京航空学院整风运动刚刚开始的第一天，3303班还没有来得及听完动员报告就贴出了第一张大字报——“告全院同学书”。大字报里用尽恶毒的言词，攻击了党和社会主义制度，在学校里点起了第一把火。
    四个月后的今天，反右派斗争已经胜利，整风进入改进工作阶段，党又号召大胆地鸣放，积极地提意见。同学们经过几个月来的锻炼，知道过去是上了右派分子的当。在动员大会的第二天一清早，3303班的青年小伙子们，他们又贴了第一张大字报。对学校领导上提了三十多条意见。不同的是，大字报里再也找不出一点恶毒的言语了。
