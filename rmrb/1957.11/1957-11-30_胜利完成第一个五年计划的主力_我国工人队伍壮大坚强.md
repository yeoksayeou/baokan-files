Xinhua News Agency, 29th: The basic ranks of China's working class—the number of employees in various industrial sectors—have grown tremendously in the four years since the Seventh National Congress of Trade Unions of China. Currently, the total number of employees working in industries, capital construction, and transportation and postal services alone reaches 12 million. This is an increase of more than 4.5 million people compared to the end of 1952.

As a result of implementing the policy of giving priority to the development of heavy industry, the proportion of employees in industrial sectors producing means of production (electricity, mining, smelting, machine manufacturing, etc.) to the total number of industrial employees has increased from 51% in 1952 to 59% in 1956. The number of employees in agriculture, forestry, water conservancy, and meteorology has nearly tripled in the past few years.

In many areas where the industrial base was extremely weak in the past, the workforce is also growing rapidly with the construction of emerging industries. Taking Shaanxi, Gansu, and Xinjiang as examples, the total number of employees in 1952 was 158,000, but now it has reached 266,000.

It is particularly worth mentioning that with the development of inland industries, a contingent of minority workers has been formed. According to statistics from eight provinces and regions, including Qinghai, Gansu, Xinjiang, Yunnan, Guangxi, Sichuan, Guizhou, and Inner Mongolia, the number of minority employees has now reached more than 80,000, accounting for 47% of the total number of employees in the eight regions.

Compared with the time when the "Seventh National Congress" of trade unions was held in May 1953, the number of employees in various industrial sectors in our country has not only increased greatly, but has also become more politically mature. In the past few years, the vast number of employees in these sectors, together with the people of the whole country, have experienced the movements of eliminating counter-revolutionaries and the upsurge of socialist transformation. On the basis of the victory of socialist transformation in 1956, they launched a new upsurge of production with unprecedented enthusiasm. After the rectification campaign began in May of this year, the national employees stood at the forefront in the struggle against the rightists. While repelling the bourgeois rightists' attacks on the Party, the vast number of employees made even more outstanding achievements in production, demonstrating that China's working class is the most powerful defender and leading class of socialism.

Through the training of the above-mentioned movements, the consciousness of employees has been continuously improved, and a large number of employees have joined the Communist Party and the Communist Youth League one after another. At present, in the industrial, construction, transportation, and postal sectors alone, there are more than 1.3 million Communist Party members and more than 1.5 million members of the Communist Youth League.

The cause of socialist construction not only requires China's working class to become an organized, disciplined, and conscious class, but also requires this class to become a cultured and skilled force.

The Party, the government, and trade union organizations at all levels attach great importance to the cultural and technical education of employees and have carried out a lot of work. From 1953 to 1956, the state trained a total of 1.01 million new skilled workers, and 2.43 million employees improved their technical proficiency through training. The improvement of the cultural and technical level of employees not only ensured the early completion of China's first five-year plan, but also produced a large number of industrial enterprise leading cadres and engineering and technical personnel who were both red and expert during this period. This has created favorable conditions for the implementation of China's upcoming second five-year plan.

    胜利完成第一个五年计划的主力
    我国工人队伍壮大坚强
    据新华社29日讯　我国工人阶级的基本队伍——各工业部门的职工人数，在中国工会第七次全国代表大会以来的四年多里有了巨大的增长。现在单是在工业、基本建设和交通邮电等部门工作的职工，总数就达一千二百万人。这比1952年底增加了四百五十多万人。
    由于执行优先发展重工业方针的结果，在生产生产资料的工业部门（电力、采矿、冶炼、机器制造等）中，职工人数占工业职工总数的比例，已由1952年的51％，上升到1956年的59％。农业、林业、水利和气象等部门的职工在这几年中增加了近三倍。
    许多过去工业基础极为薄弱的地区随着新兴工业的建设，工人队伍也在迅速增长。以陕西、甘肃、新疆三个地区为例，1952年的职工总数为十五万八千人，现在已经达到二十六万六千人。
    值得特别提出的是，由于内地工业的发展，一支少数民族工人队伍已经形成。据青海、甘肃、新疆、云南、广西、四川、贵州、内蒙古等八个省区的统计，少数民族职工现在已达八万人以上，占八个地区职工总人数的47％。
    同1953年5月工会“七大”开会的时候相比，我国各工业部门职工不仅在数量上大大增加，同时在政治上也更加成熟。在过去的几年里，这些部门的广大职工同全国人民一道经历了肃清反革命、社会主义改造高潮等运动；在1956年社会主义改造胜利的基础上，又以空前高涨的热情掀起了新的生产高潮。今年5月整风运动开始后，全国职工在反对右派的斗争中又站到了最前列。广大职工一面反击资产阶级右派分子向党进攻，一面在生产上更加突出地作出了成就，表现出我国工人阶级是社会主义的最有力的捍卫者和领导阶级。
    通过上述运动的锻炼，职工觉悟不断提高，大批职工先后参加了共产党和共青团。目前，全国仅在工业、基建、交通运输和邮电部门职工中，就有共产党员一百三十多万人，团员已达一百五十万人以上。
    社会主义建设事业不仅要求我国工人阶级成为一个有组织有纪律有觉悟的阶级，同时也要求这个阶级成为一个有文化有技术的队伍。
    党、政府和各级工会组织，对于职工的文化技术教育极为重视，并且进行了许多工作。在1953年到1956年内，国家共培养了一百零一万新的技术工人，经过培养训练提高了技术熟练程度的职工有二百四十三万人。职工文化技术水平的提高，不仅保证了我国第一个五年计划的提前完成，同时有一大批人在这个期间成了又红又专的工业企业领导干部和工程技术人员。这为执行即将开始的我国第二个五年计划创造了有利条件。
