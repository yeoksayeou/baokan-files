    Liu Hulan Chinese Language Group Begins New Academic Year
    Dear Comrades:
    Since the "People's Daily" published my letter introducing the Liu Hulan Chinese Language Group in Sochi, I and my students have been continuously receiving a large number of letters from China. Most of these letters are written by middle school and university graduates. From these letters, we see the happy lives of Chinese youth and their infinite youthful vitality in building their motherland.
    I apologize that there are so many letters, and my students still don't know how to write letters in Chinese, and I am also sick. Despite this, I have already written dozens of reply letters these days.
    The Liu Hulan Chinese Language Group has already started its new academic year. On July 1st and August 1st this year, we twice invited Chinese students to solemnly celebrate the anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party and the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. To celebrate China's National Day, on October 1st my students began publishing the "Friendship" magazine. This magazine is published every two months, and its content is about the life of the Liu Hulan Chinese Language Group and an introduction to China.
                                With brotherly greetings,
                        Liu Hulan Chinese Language Group Teacher, Navumov (with picture)

### 刘胡兰中文小组开始新学年

专栏：苏联来信

    刘胡兰中文小组开始新学年亲爱的同志们：
    自从“人民日报”登了我介绍索契市刘胡兰中文小组的来信以后，我和我的学生接连不断收到中国寄来的大批信件。这些信多半都是中学毕业生和大学生写来的。从这些信里我们看到了中国青年的幸福生活和他们建设祖国的无限青春活力。
    抱歉的是，来的信那么多，我的学生们还不会用中文写信，而我又有病了。尽管这样，这些天，我已经写了几十封回信。
    刘胡兰中文小组已经开始了新学年。今年7月1日和8月1日，我们曾先后两次邀请了中国留学生一起隆重地庆祝了中国共产党的诞辰和中国解放军建军三十周年。为了庆祝中国国庆节，10月1日我的学生们开始出刊“友好”杂志。这个杂志每两个月出一期，内容是关于刘胡兰中文小组的生活和中国情况介绍。
                                此致
    兄弟般友谊的敬礼
