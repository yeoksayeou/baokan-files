Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, November 1st. Jiangsu Province's agricultural departments at all county levels have broken down conservative and fearful thinking, and the area of dry land converted to rice paddies next year will increase from 1.55 million mu to 3.14 million mu.

This year, the more than 1.36 million mu of rice paddies converted from dry land in Jiangsu Province have generally achieved bumper harvests. In the past two years, the province has increased grain production by more than 500 million jin due to the conversion of dry land to paddy fields. However, some people regarded the many new problems and some shortcomings encountered in the work of converting dry land to paddy fields as a result of "the pace of converting dry land to paddy fields being too fast." Some people were frightened by the difficulties and believed that there were insurmountable obstacles. At a recent work conference on converting dry land to paddy fields held by the Provincial Department of Agriculture with representatives from various counties, these issues were debated. Everyone believed that converting dry land to paddy fields is a major measure to increase agricultural production, and it is necessary to use revolutionary spirit to overcome difficulties.

Examples cited at the meeting showed that Funing County, an advanced area in converting dry land to paddy fields, has been converting for three consecutive years. Over the years, Funing County has mobilized 120,000 laborers, excavated more than 5,500 large and small canals, and built more than 3,300 various culverts, solving the water conservancy problem. In the past three years, the county's area of dry land converted to paddy fields reached 530,000 mu, accounting for 64.2% of the total cultivated land, and it has become a new rice-producing county in northern Jiangsu. Funing County's bold innovative spirit has greatly inspired other counties. At the beginning, the masses in Binhai County were worried that rice would not grow due to lack of fertilizer. The county's leadership mobilized the masses to combine dredging old river courses with collecting fertilizer. Last winter, they increased the accumulation of river mud by more than 210,000 cubic meters of soil, and this spring they mobilized the masses to cut green grass, so that every mu of rice paddy converted from dry land was fertilized. The county's 125,000 mu of dry land converted to rice paddy achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest.

In the debate, everyone believed that the existing water conservancy conditions had not been fully utilized. Only 22% of the existing water sources in the Huaiyin area were used this year. The water conservancy projects that have already been completed in Huaiyin County can be used to convert 300,000 mu of land to rice paddies, but this year only more than 80,000 mu were converted. Donghai County has built six reservoirs and renovated many large, medium, and small water conservancy projects in the past three years, but in the past two years, only more than 4,500 mu of dry land have been converted to paddy fields. After criticizing conservative ideas, Donghai County is preparing to fully utilize existing water sources and convert more than 65,000 mu of dry land to paddy fields next year.

The representatives also used specific facts to criticize statements such as "the masses in the Xuhuai area and Yancheng area live a hard life, and conversion must rely on national support" and "converting dry land to paddy fields requires a lot of money, and big things cannot be done with little money." For example, Tiaogang Agricultural Cooperative and Haozhou Agricultural Cooperative in Funing County have similar natural conditions. Due to Tiaogang Cooperative's attention to diligence and thrift in the reform, it only invested 7 jiao and 9 fen per mu of land. Haozhou Cooperative spent money lavishly, investing 3 yuan and 5 jiao per mu of land. The masses reflected: the same output with two different investments, blaming the cadres for not using the money wisely.

### 用革命精神打破保守思想  江苏明年扩大水田一倍

    用革命精神打破保守思想
    江苏明年扩大水田一倍
    新华社南京1日电　江苏省各县农业部门打破保守畏难思想，明年旱田改种水稻的面积将从一百五十五万亩增加到三百一十四万亩。
    今年江苏省旱田改水田的一百三十六万多亩稻田普遍获得丰收。两年来全省由于旱田改水田增产了五亿多斤粮食。但有些人把旱田改水田工作中遇到的许多新问题和某些缺点看成是“旱田改水田的步子跨大了”的结果。有些人在困难面前被吓住了，认为有不可克服的困难。最近省农业厅召开的有各县代表参加的旱田改水田工作会议上，对这些问题进行了辩论。大家认为旱田改水田是农业增产的重大措施，要用革命精神去战胜困难。
    会上举出的例子说明，旱田改水田先进地区阜宁县已经连续改了三年。几年中，阜宁县共动员了十二万劳动力，开挖大小渠道五千五百多条，兴建各种涵洞三千三百多座，解决了水利问题。三年来全县旱田改水田面积达五十三万亩，占耕地总面积64．2％，已成为苏北新的水稻县。阜宁县的大胆革新精神给其它各县很大启发。滨海县群众开始顾虑缺肥稻不长，县的领导部门发动群众把疏浚旧河道和积取肥料结合起来，去冬增积河泥二十一万多方土，今春又发动群众割青草，使亩亩旱田改水田的稻田施上了肥料，全县十二万五千亩旱田改水稻田取得了空前丰收。
    在辩论中，大家认为现有水利条件并没有充分被利用起来。淮阴专区现有水源今年只利用了22％。淮阴县已做的水利工程可以改种水稻三十万亩，但今年全县只改了八万多亩。东海县在最近三年内修建了六座水库，整修了许多大、中、小型水利工程，但两年中旱田改水田只有四千五百多亩。批判了保守思想后，东海县准备充分利用现有水源，明年旱田改水田六万五千多亩。
    代表们还以具体事实批判了“徐淮地区和盐城专区群众生活苦，要改就得依靠国家支持”、“要旱田改水田就得花大钱，钱少不能办大事”等说法。如阜宁县条岗农业社和郝周农业社自然条件相仿。条岗社由于在改革中注意勤俭，每亩田只投资七角九分。郝周社用钱大手大脚，每亩田投资了三元五角，群众反映：两样投资，一样的产量，责备干部没有把钱用在刀口上。
