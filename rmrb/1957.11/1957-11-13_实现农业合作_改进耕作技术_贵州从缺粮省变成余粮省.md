Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, November 11th: Guizhou Province has transformed from a grain-deficient province to a grain-surplus province. During the first Five-Year Plan period, it not only didn't require grain supplies from the state but also had surplus grain to transfer out each year to support the country's socialist construction. From 1953 to October 1957, a total of over 2.1 billion jin of rice, wheat, and corn were transported from Guizhou to provinces like Guangxi. The surplus grain transferred out from July to October this year exceeded the total surplus grain transferred out in 1953.

Guizhou Province has many mountains and poor soil, and before liberation, it was consistently unable to be self-sufficient in grain. In 1949, the average person only had 300 jin of grain, and the chronic grain shortage required imports from Sichuan Province. In the three years after liberation, Guizhou Province basically achieved self-sufficiency. After completing land reform in 1952, the rural productive forces were liberated, and the mutual aid and cooperation movement was steadily developed. Through the construction of agricultural irrigation projects and the improvement of farming techniques, a bumper harvest was achieved in 1953, transforming Guizhou from a historically grain-deficient province into a grain-surplus province. Since then, the total grain output has risen sharply. In 1955, the province exceeded its first Five-Year Plan grain production target ahead of schedule, reaching 8.524 billion jin. In 1956, after the province achieved agricultural collectivization, although 3.6 million mu of cultivated land suffered severe drought, the province's grain output still increased by 1.2 billion jin, and the grain consumption level of farmers increased from an average of 466 jin per person in 1954 to 542 jin. This year, the province's grain output increased by another 850 million jin compared to last year, with a total output of 10.58 billion jin. Compared to 1949, this year's net increase in grain is 4.65 billion jin, and the average grain possession per person will nearly double. In Duyun County, Qiannan Buyi and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, each farmer received more than 700 jin of grain this year.

Due to the continuous increase in grain output, although the grain consumption level of farmers has increased year by year, the surplus grain that farmers of all ethnic groups in Guizhou Province transfer out to support the country's construction has continued to increase. In 1954, 385 million jin were transferred out; in 1956, it rose to 484 million jin; and in the first ten months of this year, more than 500 million jin of surplus grain were transferred out.

### 实现农业合作　改进耕作技术  贵州从缺粮省变成余粮省

    实现农业合作　改进耕作技术
    贵州从缺粮省变成余粮省
    据新华社贵阳11日电　贵州省已经从缺粮省变成了余粮省。在第一个五年计划期间，不仅不要国家供应粮食，而且每年都有余粮调出支援国家的社会主义建设。1953年到1957年10月，由贵州运往广西等省的大米、小麦、玉米共二十一亿多斤。今年7月至10月外调余粮就超过1953年外调余粮的总和。
    贵州省山多土瘦，解放前粮食一向不能自给，1949年，每人平均只占有粮食三百斤，历来的缺粮需要从四川省运进。在解放后的头三年，贵州省基本上达到自给自足。1952年完成土地改革后，解放了农村生产力，稳步开展了互助合作运动，兴修农田水利、改进耕作技术，1953年空前丰收，使贵州由历史上的缺粮省一跃而为余粮省。从此以后，粮食总产量直线上升，1955年就提前超额完成贵州省第一个五年计划规定的粮食生产任务，达到八十五亿二千四百万斤。全省实现农业合作化后的1956年，虽然有三百六十万亩耕地遭受严重旱灾，全省粮食仍增产十二亿斤，农民用粮水平由1954年每人平均四百六十六斤增加到五百四十二斤。今年全省粮食又比去年增产八亿五千万斤，总产量达到一百零五亿八千万斤。和1949年相比，今年净增粮食四十六亿五千万斤，每人占有粮食将近增加一倍。黔南布依族苗族自治州都匀县，今年每一农民分得粮食超过七百斤。
    由于粮食产量不断增加，农民用粮水平虽然逐年提高，贵州省各族农民外调支援国家建设事业的余粮仍愈来愈多，1954年外调三亿八千五百万斤，1956年上升为四亿八千四百万斤，而今年前十个月外运余粮就超过五亿斤。（附图片）
