Fully Utilizing Bast Fiber
    —— Interview with Mr. Feng Yunhe
		By Our Correspondent Xi Ping

Seeking new sources of raw materials for the textile industry is an important task for China's textile industry today. Mr. Feng Yunhe, a consultant to the Ministry of Textile Industry of the Central Government who is engaged in hemp research at the East China Textile Administration Bureau, recently submitted a proposal to the State Planning Commission on developing the hemp textile industry. In her proposal, she stated: "Extensive use of hemp fiber to spin various fabrics is an important way to solve the current shortage of raw cotton and meet the clothing needs of 600 million people."

Mr. Feng Yunhe raised an important issue. To hear her views in detail, I visited her one early autumn morning. When I entered, I saw her carrying a travel bag, and I thought she was about to leave. But she smiled and said to me, "This bag is for you, and it contains various materials about hemp." Opening the bag, it was full of colorful samples of various hemp fabrics, including woolen cloth, silk, printed hemp gauze, colored line cloth, and bundles of clean, bright fibers. In the past, when we mentioned hemp fabrics, we thought of a kind of white, stiff summer cloth worn by the elderly in the summer, which was easy to wrinkle, but the fabrics that appeared in front of me now were not only brightly colored and pleasing, but also very soft, with almost no difference from ordinary cloth and silk. Ms. Feng found that I was very interested in these hemp fabrics, and took out a bundle of clean, bright fibers from her handbag, pulling out some of the slender fluff for me to see, and said, "This is Apocynum fiber, which is more than fifty millimeters long, more than twenty millimeters longer than the average Jiangsu Daizi cotton. Its strength and tensile force are four times that of cotton, and it does not shrink when exposed to water. What a great resource this is!"

Ms. Feng said that the development of the hemp textile industry has many favorable conditions in China. China's climate and soil are particularly suitable for the growth of various hemp plants. Farmers in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hubei and other provinces have long grown ramie. The Apocynum discovered in Xinjiang, Qinghai, Gansu, Inner Mongolia, Shandong and other places after liberation, and the Urtica, stinging nettle, and mountain foot hemp discovered in Northeast China and Fujian, are all good textile resources. Flax, with an annual output of more than one million dan, used to be used as fuel, but in fact, its fiber quality is second only to flax. After refining, it can be woven into sacks and canvas, and after complete degumming, it can be blended with cotton to weave cloth. In addition to ramie, the annual output of wild hemp and flax in China is roughly estimated at about four to five million dan. If cultivated, the output can be greatly increased. Many wastelands, mountain slopes, field edges, and wastelands that cannot grow cotton and high-yield grains can be used to grow hemp. For example, Apocynum grows on barren alkaline land, so developing hemp production not only enriches rural sideline production but also does not compete with grain for land.

Ms. Feng said that the government has attached great importance to the development of the hemp textile industry since liberation. In recent years, her personal progress in hemp research has been greater than in the ten years before liberation. She and other technicians have studied the extraction methods of flax, mountain foot hemp, Urtica, stinging nettle, Apocynum, and other hemp plants, and conducted trial spinning of the extracted fibers. They also studied the relationship between hemp fiber and various other fibers. The results of the research proved that refined hemp fiber can be spun into hemp yarn and then woven into clothing, towels, socks, parachutes, machine belts, and light canvas. Hemp fiber blended with wool and waste silk can be woven into high-grade clothing. Loosened hemp fiber can be used as quilt stuffing and clothing stuffing, and its warmth retention is no less than cotton. Inferior hemp fiber can also be used as raw material for high-grade pulp. Hemp fiber also has some unique advantages in textile applications. For example, hemp fiber blended with wool does not affect the quality of woolen fabrics, the cost can be reduced, and it is also washable and does not shrink when exposed to water. Hemp fiber blended with waste silk can maintain the luster of silk and increase its beauty. Adding 20% ​​to 30% hemp fiber to man-made fibers can overcome the shortcomings of man-made fibers, which are usually not strong, not washable, and have too soft a body. Blending hemp and cotton can enhance the wear resistance of fabrics. It is especially beneficial for tightly woven fabrics such as khaki.

Since the People's Daily published an article about Apocynum, many readers have been concerned about the cost of hemp fabrics. I asked Ms. Feng if there was a possibility of further reducing the cost of hemp fabrics? She believes that it is possible to reduce the cost of hemp fiber to close to the level of cotton. In the small-scale experiments she has done in Shanghai in recent years, the cost of extracting spinnable fiber from high-grade ramie is about 15% to 20% higher than that of cotton fiber per pound. Last year, they used 30% hemp fiber and 70% cotton on ordinary cotton spinning machines to blend a small amount. The price was only one-third of that of pure hemp yarn. The cost of each blended yarn was about nine yuan more than pure cotton yarn. After weaving into cloth, the wholesale price per bolt was only 0.29 yuan more, and after printing into calico, it was 0.39 yuan more per bolt. When trial sales were conducted in the market, each foot of blended cloth was about four cents more expensive than pure cotton cloth. According to the sales department, consumers are basically satisfied with this price. In the future, with mass production, the cost can be reduced somewhat. As for the price of Apocynum being particularly high, it is because it contains a particularly large amount of colloidal material, and the refining cost is correspondingly increased. At the same time, due to the wild nature, it contains more impurities. Coupled with transportation, the cost seems high. If the raw hemp is peeled by machine locally in the future and pre-bleached before being transported to the textile area, the cost will definitely be reduced.

Ms. Feng also said: When we calculate the accounts, we must not only carefully calculate the cost of hemp, but also start from the overall interests of the country. At present, the total output of various hemp plants in the country cannot be verified, but based on the estimated wild and domestic hemp, it is estimated that there are about five million dan to six million dan. Calculated at a 50% refining rate, three million dan of spinnable fiber can be extracted. According to experiments, each catty of pure hemp fiber can be woven into 3.5 to 4 yards of hemp cloth, so 12 million meters of hemp fabrics can be woven. If these fibers are blended with cotton or wool, the current shortage of raw cotton can be greatly alleviated. From this point of view, she believes that it is worthwhile even if the cost is slightly higher than cotton. This big picture cannot be ignored.

Ms. Feng repeatedly said: Further research and utilization of hemp fibers is a task involving various aspects. She requested the relevant central departments to establish specialized institutions to strengthen the leadership of hemp textile research work in order to provide sufficient information for mass production. This is the reason why she recently submitted a proposal to the State Planning Commission.

After interviewing Ms. Feng Yunhe, I had the opportunity to meet with the comrades in charge of the East China Textile Administration Bureau and other relevant comrades. The materials they provided to me showed that strengthening the leadership of hemp textile research work is indeed an urgent matter. The current situation is: on the one hand, the enthusiasm of the local governments is very high, especially in hemp-producing areas, they are eager to get this emerging industry off the ground. It is understood that Guangdong Province is preparing to build a 20,000-spindle ramie factory, which is scheduled to be put into production in 1959; Hubei is preparing to build a hemp refining factory with a daily output of one to seven tons. During the second five-year plan period, the province will also build a new hemp refining factory with a daily output of 25 tons. Tianjin has started cotton-hemp blending this spring, and Sichuan Province is also preparing to build a factory. Relevant personnel from these places have recently come to Shanghai one after another, requesting the supply of various technical information. On the other hand, there are still many technical problems that have not been solved in the research work on hemp. For example, on the degumming of hemp and the standardization of hemp spinning machines, relevant researchers have not reached a consensus for a long time, and have been arguing for several years without an authoritative department to make a final decision. This situation has been unable to adapt to the urgent needs of current actual life. In order to supply the people with more clothing materials as soon as possible, they request the relevant central departments to take effective measures as soon as possible to strengthen the specific leadership of hemp research work.

    充分利用麻类纤维
    ——丰云鹤先生访问记	本报记者  习平
    寻求纺织工业原料的新来源，是我国纺织工业当前的一项重要工作。现在华东纺织管理局从事麻的研究工作的中央纺织工业部顾问丰云鹤先生，最近向国家计划委员会提出一个关于发展麻纺工业的意见书。她在意见书中提出：“大量地利用麻纤维，纺制成各种织物，是解决目前原棉不足、满足六亿人民衣着需要的一条重要道路。”
    丰云鹤先生提出的是一个重要问题。为了详细地倾听她的见解，在一个初秋的早晨，我去访问她。我进门的时候，见她提着一个旅行提包，以为她有事要出门。但她微笑着对我说：“这个提包是给你带的，里面装着有关麻的各种资料。”打开提包，里面全是一包包五彩缤纷的各种麻织物的样品，其中有呢绒，有绸缎，有印花麻纱，有彩色线呢等，还有一束束洁白发亮的纤维。我们过去一提到麻织物，就想到夏天老年人穿的一种白色发硬容易起皱的夏布，但是现在出现在我面前的这些织物，不仅色彩鲜艳，讨人喜爱，而且很柔和，和普通的布、绸简直没有什么差别。丰先生发现我对这些麻织物很有兴趣，又从手提包里拿出一束洁白发亮的纤维，用手拉出其中一部分细长的毛绒给我看，说：“这是罗布麻的纤维，足有五十多毫米，比一般的江苏岱字棉还长二十多毫米。它的强力和拉力有棉的四倍，而且遇水不缩。这是多好的资源！”
    丰先生说，发展麻纺工业在我国有许多有利条件。我国的气候和土壤特别适宜于各种麻的成长。江浙、两湖等省农民很早就种植苎麻。解放后在新疆、青海、甘肃、内蒙古、山东等地发现的罗布麻，在东北及福建等地发现的艳麻、螫麻、山脚麻等，都是很好的纺织资源。年产量在一百万担以上的胡麻，过去一直当燃料用，其实它的纤维质量仅次于亚麻，精洗后可以织成麻袋、帆布，完全脱胶后可以同棉混纺织成布。我国除苎麻外，野生麻和胡麻每年的产量，粗略估计约有四、五百万担，如果加以培植，产量还可以大大增加。许多荒地、山坡、田沿以及不能种棉花和高产粮食的荒地都可以用来种麻，像罗布麻就是生长在荒碱地上，所以发展麻类生产，既丰富农村的副业生产，又不与粮食争地。
    丰先生说，解放后政府很重视发展麻纺工业。近几年来，她个人在麻的研究工作上的进展，比解放前十几年还多。她和其他一些技术人员研究了胡麻、山脚麻、艳麻、螫麻、罗布麻等的提炼方法，并将提炼出来的纤维进行试纺。他们还研究了麻纤维和其他各种纤维的关系。研究的结果证明，精炼的麻纤维纺成麻纱后，可以织成衣料、手巾、袜子、降落伞、机器用带及轻帆布等。麻纤维和毛、废丝混纺，可织成高级衣料。麻纤维打松后可以作被絮和衣絮，保暖程度不亚于棉花。次等的麻纤维还可以用来作高级纸浆的原料。麻纤维在纺织上还具有一些独特的优越性。例如，麻纤维和羊毛混纺，不影响毛织物的质量，成本可以降低，还能耐洗和遇水不缩。麻纤维和废丝混纺，既可以保持绢丝的光彩，又增加美观。人造纤维掺入20％—30％的麻纤维后，就能克服人造纤维通常所有的不牢、不经洗和身骨过软的缺点。麻和棉混纺，可以增强织物的耐磨度。特别是对于组织密的织物，如卡其布等好处更大。
    自从人民日报刊登关于罗布麻的文章后，许多读者都关心麻织物的成本问题。我问丰先生进一步降低麻织物成本的可能性是不是存在？她认为把麻纤维的成本降低到接近棉花的水平是可能的。这几年她在上海小型试验的结果：用高级苎麻提炼可纺纤维，每磅成本约比棉纤维高出15％到20％。去年他们用30％的麻纤维和70％的棉花在普通的棉纺机上小量混纺，价格仅及纯麻纱的三分之一。每件混纺纱的成本比纯棉纱多九元左右，织成布后每匹批发价仅多○·二九元，印成花布后每匹多○·三九元，在市场试销时，每尺混纺布比纯棉布约高四分钱。据销售部门反映，消费者对这个价格基本上是满意的。将来大量生产以后，成本还可以降低一些。至于罗布麻的价格所以特别高，是因为它含胶质特别多，炼制费用相应增加，同时因为野生的关系，含杂质多，加上运输，成本就显得高，如果将来原麻在当地就采用机器剥皮，并经过初步漂炼再运到纺织的地区，成本是肯定可以降低的。
    丰先生还说：我们在算账的时候，不但要认真算麻的成本，也要从国家的整体利益出发。目前全国各种麻的总产量还无从考查，但就已发现的野生的和家种的麻来估计，约有五百万担到六百万担，按50％炼制率推算，可提炼三百万担可纺纤维。据试验，每斤纯麻纤维可织成麻布三点五码到四码，这样就可以织成一千二百万公尺麻织物，如果这些纤维和棉花或羊毛混纺，就可以大大缓和目前原棉不足的情况。从这个意义上来讲，她认为就是成本略高于棉花也还是值得的，这个大账不能不算。
    丰先生一再说：进一步研究和利用麻类纤维，是一件牵涉到各个方面的工作。她要求中央有关部门，成立专门机构，加强对麻纺研究工作的领导，以便给大量生产提供足够的资料。这就是她最近向国家计划委员会提出意见书的理由。
    在访问了丰云鹤先生以后，我有机会碰到华东纺管局负责同志和其他有关的同志们。他们向我提供的材料说明，加强麻纺研究工作的领导的确是刻不容缓的事。当前的情况是：一方面地方积极性很高，特别是产麻地区，他们迫切要求把这项新兴工业搞起来。据了解：广东省正在筹建一个两万锭的苎麻厂，计划1959年投入生产；湖北正在筹备一个日产一吨到七吨的炼麻厂，在第二个五年计划期间这个省还要新建日产二十五吨的炼麻工厂。天津今年春天已开始作棉麻混纺，四川省也在筹建工厂。这些地方的有关人员近日陆续来到上海，要求供给各项技术资料。另一方面，对麻的研究工作还有许多技术问题没有解决。例如关于麻的脱胶，麻纺机的定型等问题，长时期以来有关研究工作人员尚未取得一致的意见，几年来争论不休，没有一个权威部门出来最后定案。这种状况已经无法适应目前实际生活的急迫需要。为了及早地给人民供应更多的衣着原料，他们要求中央有关部门及早采取有效的措施，加强对麻的研究工作的具体领导。
