Soviet Scientists' Fruitful Labor

Soviet Union, Bulaganlawofu

Lenin once said after the victory of the October Socialist Revolution: "All the wisdom of mankind, all the creations of human genius in the past, were only to give all the wealth of technology and culture to a part of the people, and deprive another part of the people of the most necessary things—enlightenment and development. Now all technological miracles, all cultural achievements have become the property of the whole people..."

Lenin's predictions have come true.

Today, our country is at the forefront of the world in terms of scientific and technological development.

Artificial Satellites Are the Result of Highly Developed Science and Technology in Various Departments

The successful manufacture and launch of the first artificial Earth satellites is a clear proof of the high level of science, technology, and industrialization in our country. The Soviets have opened a new era in the history of world science, solved the most complex problem in science—overcoming gravity and flying into outer space—and cleared the way for studying interstellar space and the planets themselves.

The successful launch of artificial satellites is the greatest achievement of Soviet scientists and technicians, and of the workers who work in our industry. This is the result of years of labor by scientists who study physics and mathematics, radio technology and electronics, chemistry and geology, astronomy and astrophysics, automation and control mechanics, geochemistry and biochemistry, and many other scientific departments. This victory is inseparable from the achievements of our instrument manufacturing, metallurgy, machine manufacturing, chemical, and other industrial sectors.

It should be pointed out that Soviet scientists have made great contributions to the development of the following scientific fields: supersonic aerodynamics, the theory of rocket motion trajectory, the elasticity of air, the movement of objects with changing mass, wave dynamics, the plasticity and creep of metals, the stability of motion, automatic adjustment, and so on.

The Soviet Union is the Most Advanced in the World in the Peaceful Use of Atomic Energy

The Soviet Union occupies the most advanced position in the world in the peaceful use of atomic energy. The Soviet Academy of Sciences' atomic power plant began supplying electricity to users more than three years ago. According to the resolutions of the 20th Congress of the CPSU, a broad plan is being implemented to build some larger atomic power plants with a total power generation capacity of two million to two and a half million kilowatts. The atomic icebreaker is being built smoothly, and some atomic power units for transportation are also being manufactured.

Unfortunately, it is not possible to fully outline the prospects of atomic energy dynamics today. Only one thing is clear: the future of atomic energy dynamics is bright, and its role in technological progress is enormous. Therefore, special attention is paid to the large-scale and extremely complex work carried out in manufacturing the world's largest proton accelerator with an energy of 10 billion electron volts.

Now, a more powerful proton accelerator with an energy of 50 billion electron volts is also being manufactured. This will enable us to study the nature of nuclear forces and the properties of elementary particles more deeply.

Through the research of our scientists Kurchatov, Blokhintsev, and Alexandrov, some first-class reactors for research and power generation that produce radioactive isotopes have been manufactured. Radioactive isotopes are being used as radiation sources and "tracer" atoms in research and production work more and more widely.

In the petroleum and coal industries, the use of radioactive isotopes makes it possible to use completely new electrical measurement methods that do not require sampling. The problem of using cobalt isotope gamma rays to find coal seams buried in rock formations has been successfully solved. In the metallurgical system, isotopes are used to study blast furnace processes, and are used in metallography and metal physics, thermal engineering, hydraulic engineering, and engineering geology. Experiments have shown that radioactive radiation can change the properties of materials in a prescribed direction and realize chemical processes that were previously impossible. Cobalt, cesium, thulium, and iridium isotopes are widely used in the actual work of enterprises to check the quality of metal products.

Soviet scientists are studying the problem of controlling the thermonuclear reaction of light elements, especially the thermonuclear reaction of hydrogen, for power purposes.

Development of Radio and Electronics

Many of the great discoveries and achievements of modern science are, to a certain extent, related to the development of radio physics, radio technology, and electronics, to the study of the laws of radio wave propagation, especially in the upper atmosphere, to radio transmitting and receiving methods, to the search for new radio wave channels for long-distance transmission, to the mastery of new radio wave bands, and to the study of radio relay communication and radio wave communication systems. Television, radio positioning, and radio astronomy have been created due to the research of meter, decimeter, and centimeter radio waves.

Radio positioning (which is related to the development of pulse technology) provides us with the possibility of transmitting instrument indicators over long distances. For example, the distance measured by a radio positioner can now reach the moon. Radio telescopes have been used to study the sun and outer space.

Radio technology and electronics are being used more and more widely in production. Radio technology and electronics are constantly improving the precision, stability, reliability, and speed of the production technology itself and the products produced. For example, the speed of automated mechanical actions has reached 10-4 to 10-5 seconds.

Soviet Union's Contribution to Laying the Scientific Foundation for Semiconductor Research

Semiconductors are becoming increasingly important for technological progress. It is expected that due to the use of semiconductors, huge changes will occur in various technical fields in the near future. Soviet scientists have made many contributions to establishing the scientific foundation of semiconductor physics and technology. Joffe and Davydov studied the process of current passing through electron-hole channels. Tamm theoretically demonstrated the surface phenomena and properties of crystals. The exciton theory proposed by Frenkel enables us to explain many phenomena related to heat transfer and light absorption in semiconductors.

Work is underway to directly convert light energy and heat energy into electrical energy using semiconductor photocells and semiconductor thermoelectric couples. Soviet scientists have theoretically demonstrated this phenomenon and researched the necessary instruments and devices: photocells, thermoelectric generators, etc. Joffe and Lashkarev have obtained important results in this area. Guchkov has researched powerful semiconductor rectifiers, and Kolomiets has researched highly sensitive cadmium sulfide photocells.

Electronic Computers and Production Automation

The manufacture of electronic computers is an achievement of science in recent decades.

Production automation is an extremely important trend in the development of Soviet production. Here lies the huge potential to increase labor productivity.

In the chemical industry, the automation of the control and adjustment of a series of parameters of technological operation processes has been widely promoted, and individual sections and workshops have transitioned to overall automation.

In the petroleum industry, automatic electrical measuring stations have been built and are being used successfully. The adjustment of the level and pressure of liquids at the wellhead is automated, and automatic pumping units are being used extensively. Many compressor stations automatically adjust the supply of compressed air. Experience in the overall automation of petroleum refining processes has been accumulated.

Machine tool manufacturing has firmly achieved automation. From individual automated machine tools to automatic production lines and fully automated production, this is the basic direction of technological progress in this sector.

The development of modern automation devices is increasingly closely related to the application of electronics and calculating devices that control and automate operation processes. The latest achievement in this regard is the use of fast electronic computers to control production processes according to a prescribed program, which opens up the possibility of automating the control of assembly line operations. The widespread use of automatic production lines and the transition to fully automated enterprises are related to the use of such machines.

In recent years, a very important task in automation has been solved: the creation of standard machine tools for automatic production lines. Automatic production lines for manufacturing motor shafts have been working for about three years. These automatic production lines are composed of horizontal standard machine tools. An automatic production line for processing gears, which is composed of vertical standard machine tools, has recently been built.

Two milling machines and one lathe controlled according to the operation program made by the Metal Cutting Machine Tool Testing Scientific Research Institute are new products. One milling machine is used for stereoscopic milling and its operation program is recorded on magnetic tape. Another milling machine is equipped with punched paper tape, and the insertion device installed on the machine tool can translate the program recorded on this paper tape. This milling machine can be used to mill objects of various shapes. The lathe is equipped with a program keyboard. This lathe is used to process stepped and conical rotating bodies. The calculation devices on these three machine tools are all made of semiconductors, making these devices reliable and durable in use.

The Institute of Automation and Remote Control of the Soviet Academy of Sciences Bulgakov developed a system for controlling milling machines according to a program. Kotelnikov and others are successfully manufacturing discontinuous systems for automatically controlling high-precision machine tools.

Soviet scientists have developed the legacy of Lyapunov, Zhukovsky, and Chebyshev in the theory of motion stability and automatic adjustment, and have solved a series of problems that are of urgent practical significance in nonlinear adjustment theory, statics, automatic adjustment systems, and the establishment of standard and automatic adjustment systems.

Chetaev, Lurie, Letov, and others studied the methods of practically applying Lyapunov's theory of motion stability to nonlinear systems of automatic adjustment. A group of scientists led by Tsyplin established the theoretical foundation of the pulse system for automatic control and operation. Pugachev and Solodovnikov formulated the calculation methods for standard adjustment systems.

Remote Control

Remote control is of great significance in technological progress, as it can control machines and units that are far apart from each other. The central dispatch station now manages more than half of the power generation work of our entire power system. Most of the hydroelectric power stations and transformer substations of the main power transmission network have been converted to remote control. The application of remote control in the railway transportation industry is also expanding.

Gavrilov and Razhkashvili of the Institute of Automatic Control and Remote Control of the Soviet Academy of Sciences have manufactured some very promising remote signaling devices; these devices use magnetic components and have a rectangular hysteresis loop. The new device does not require human care, can work continuously under any conditions, and is as reliable as a wire. This will expand the application of remote control in production conditions. The "Electric Pulse" factory will soon begin producing this device, and the coal industry, the metallurgical industry, railway transportation, and hydroelectric power stations have already begun preparing to adopt this device. ※※※

The Communist Party has raised our science to the advanced position in the world. Soviet scientists and engineers are dedicating all their strength and knowledge to carry forward the achievements of the country's science and technology for the honor of our motherland.

    苏联科学家们卓有成效的劳动
    苏联　布拉冈拉沃夫
    列宁在十月社会主义革命胜利以后就曾说过：“以往全部人类智慧、全部人类天才的创造，只是为了把技术和文化的一切财富给予一部分人，而剥夺另一部分人最必需的东西——启蒙和发展。现在一切技术奇迹、一切文化成果都成为全民的财产……”
    列宁的这些预言实现了。
    今天，我国在科学技术发展方面已经站在世界的前列。
    人造卫星是各部门科学技术高度发展的成果
    第一批人造地球卫星的制成和发射成功，是我国科学技术和我国工业化高度水平的明证。苏维埃人在世界科学史上开辟了新纪元，解决了科学中最复杂的课题——克服重力和飞入宇宙空间，为研究星际空间和行星本身扫清了道路。
    人造卫星的发射成功，是苏联科学技术工作者，是我们在工业中工作的工人最伟大的功绩。这是研究物理学和数学、无线电技术和电子学、化学和地质学、天文学和天体物理学、自动化和赶控力学、地球化学和生物化学以及其他许多科学部门的科学家多年劳动的成果。这一胜利同我国仪器制造业、冶金业、机器制造业、化学和其它工业部门的成就是分不开的。
    不能不指出苏联科学家在发展下列科学部门中的巨大功绩，这就是：超音速航空动力学、火箭运动弹道理论、空气的弹性、质量变化的物体的运动、波动力学、金属的塑性和蠕变、运动的稳定性、自动调整等等。
      苏联在和平利用原子能方面是世界最先进的
    苏联在和平利用原子能方面占世界最先进的地位。苏联科学院原子能发电站早在三年多以前就开始向用户供电了。根据苏共第二十次代表大会的决议，正在实现兴建总发电能力为二百万到二百五十万瓩的一些规模更大的原子能发电站的广泛计划。原子破冰船正在顺利地建造，一些运输用的原子能动力装置也正在制造。
    遗憾的是，今天还不能全面概述原子能动力学的远景。只有一点是清楚的：原子能动力学的未来是远大的，它在技术进步中的作用是巨大的。因此，在制造世界上最大的能量达一百亿电子伏特的质子加速器方面进行的规模巨大和极其复杂的工作，受到特别的重视。
    现在还在制造更强大的能量达五百亿电子伏特的质子加速器。这将使我们有可能更深入地研究核力的本质和基本粒子的性质。
    经过我国科学家库尔查托夫、勃洛欣采夫、亚历山德罗夫的研究，制成了一些供研究用和供动力用的生产放射性同位素的头等反应堆，放射性同位素做为辐射源泉和“示踪”原子在研究工作中、生产工作中正在得到日益广泛的应用。
    在石油工业和煤炭工业中，运用放射性同位素就可以采用完全新的、无须取样品的电测法。使用钴同位素丙种射线寻找埋藏在岩层中的煤层的问题已经成功的解决了。在冶金系中，同位素被用来研究高炉过程，用于金相学和金属物理学、热工学、水工技术和工程地质学等方面。试验表明，放射性辐射能够使材料的性质向规定的方向改变，实现从前做不到的化学过程。在企业的实际工作中极广泛地使用了钴、铯、铦、铱同位素来检查金属制品的质量。
    苏联科学家正在研究控制轻元素的热核反应、首先是氢的热核反应以用于动力目的的问题。
          无线电和电子学的发展
    现代科学的许多巨大发现和成就在一定程度上同无线电物理学、无线电技术和电子学的发展，同无线电波的传播规律，特别是在大气高层的传播规律的研究，同无线电收发报方法，新的供远距离发报用的无线电波道的探寻，同无线电波新的波段的掌握，同无线电继电通信和电波通信系统的研究都有关系。由于公尺、公寸、公分无线电波的研究，创造出了电视、无线电定位和无线电天文学。
    无线电定位（脉冲技术的发展与此有关）给我们提供了在远距离之内传送仪器的指数的可能性。例如，无线电定位器测量的距离现在已可远达月球。无线电天文望远镜已被用来对太阳和宇宙空间进行研究。
    无线电技术和电子学正在日益广泛地运用到生产中。无线电技术和电子学不断提高着生产技术本身以及生产出来的成品的精密程度、稳定性、可靠性和快速程度。例如，自动化机械动作的快速程度已经达到10－4—10－5秒。
    苏联在奠定半导体研究的科学基础方面的贡献
    半导体对技术进步的意义越来越大。可以预料，由于半导体的采用，不久的将来在各种技术领域中都将发生巨大的变化。苏联科学家对建立半导体物理学和技术的科学基础做了不少的贡献。约飞和达维多夫研究了电流通过电子孔通道的过程。塔姆在理论上论证了晶体的表面现象和性质。弗连克尔所提出来的激子论使我们能够解释许多同半导体中的热转移和光吸收有关的现象。
    利用半导体光电管和半导体温差电偶把光能和热能直接变为电能的工作正在进行中。苏联科学家已在理论上论证了这个现象，研究出了必须的器械和装置：光电管、热电发电机等等。约飞·拉什卡列夫在这方面得出了重要的结果。古奇科夫研究出了强大的半导体整流器，科洛米耶茨研究出了灵敏度极高的硫化镉光电管。
            电子计算机和生产自动化
    电子计算机的制成，是最近几十年来科学的成就。
    生产自动化是苏联生产发展的极重要的趋势。这里隐藏着提高劳动生产率的巨大潜力。
    在化学工业中已经广泛地推行了技术操作过程的一系列参数的控制和调整的自动化，单个工段和车间已经过渡到全盘自动化。
    在石油工业方面，建成并顺利地使用着自动电测站。井口液体的水平和压力的调整是自动化的，大量地运用着自动汲取机。许多压缩机站都是自动调节压缩空气的供应。已经积累了石油提炼过程全盘自动化的经验。
    机床制造业稳固地实现了自动化。由单个自动化机床到自动作业线和全部自动化生产，这是这一部门技术进步的基本方向。
    现代自动化装置的发展同电子学和指挥自动化操纵操作过程的计算装置的应用有着日益密切的联系。这方面的最新成就是使用快速电子计算机按规定的大纲操纵生产过程，这就开辟了自动化操纵流水作业的可能性。广泛地采用自动作业线，并过渡到全盘自动化的企业，是同使用这种机器有关的。
    近几年来，解决了一个在自动化方面极为重要的课题：创造了自动作业线用标准机床。制造电动机轴的自动作业线已经工作了三年左右。这些自动作业线是由卧式标准机床组成的。不久前建成了加工齿轮的自动作业线，它是由立式标准机床组成的。
    金属切削机床试验科学研究所制成的按操作大纲操纵的两台铣床和一台车床是一种新产品。一台铣床用于立体铣它的操作大纲记录在磁带上。另一台铣床装有凿孔纸带，装在机床上的插入装置可以把这个纸带上记录的大纲翻译出来，这台铣床可以用来铣制各种外形的物件。车床上装有大纲键盘。这台车床用来对阶段式和圆锥形旋转体进行加工。这三台机床上的计算装置都是用半导体做的，使这种装置在使用方面可靠而结实。
    苏联科学院自动化和远距离操纵研究所布尔加科夫制定了按大纲操纵铣床的系统。科捷尔尼科夫等人顺利地制造着自动化操纵高精确度机床的不连续的系统。
    苏联科学家发展了利亚普诺夫、茹科夫斯基、契贝谢夫在运动稳定性和自动化调节理论方面的遗产，解决了一系列的在非直线调整理论、静力学、自动化调整系统、建立标准的和自动调整系统等对实际工作有迫切意义的问题。
    契塔耶夫、卢里叶、列托夫等人研究了把利亚普诺夫关于运动稳定性的学说实际运用到自动调整的非直线系统的方法。以泽普金为首的一批科学家创立了自动控制和操纵的脉冲系统理论基础。普加契夫和索洛多夫尼科夫制定了标准调整系统的计算方法。
                远距离操纵
    远距离操纵在技术进步中具有重要意义，它可以操纵彼此距离很远的机器和机组。中央调度站现在管理着我国全部动力系统半数以上的发电工作。大多数水电站和干线输电网的变电所已经改为远距离操纵。远距离操纵在铁路运输业中的运用也在日益扩大。
    苏联科学院自动控制和远距离操纵研究所加夫里洛夫和饶日卡什维利制成一些非常有前途的远距离信号装置；这种装置采用磁性元件并有直角磁滞环。新的装置不需要人照顾，可以在任何条件下不停地工作，而且像导线一样可靠。这将会扩大远距离操纵在生产条件中的应用。“电脉冲”工厂很快就要开始生产这种装置，煤炭工业、冶金工业、铁路运输、水电站都已经着手准备采用这种装置。※※※
    共产党把我们的科学提高到世界上的先进地位。苏联科学家和工程师正献出自己的全部力量和知识，为了我们祖国的荣誉发扬光大祖国科学技术的成就。（注：文中小标题是新华社编者加的）
