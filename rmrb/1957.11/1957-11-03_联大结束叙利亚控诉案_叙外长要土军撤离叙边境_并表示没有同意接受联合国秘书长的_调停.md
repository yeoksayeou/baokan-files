Xinhua News Agency, New York, 2nd: The United Nations General Assembly concluded its discussion on November 1st on Syria’s complaint regarding threats to its security and international peace from Turkey. The Syrian representative, as well as the representatives of the seven nations who proposed that the UN Secretary-General conduct “mediation” between Syria and Turkey, stated at the meeting, in accordance with the agreement they reached outside the session the previous day, that they would not insist on the passage of their respective proposals. Therefore, no vote was held. However, according to Syria’s wishes, the issue remains on the agenda of the UN General Assembly.

After the meeting, Syrian Foreign Minister Bitar issued a statement and answered questions at a press conference, clarifying Syria’s position.

Bitar pointed out that bringing the issue of Turkey’s threat to Syria’s security and international peace to the United Nations was to take action to prevent possible aggression, since Turkey had amassed troops on the Syrian border while conducting a propaganda war.

Bitar emphasized that the essence of the current problem is the struggle between the liberation forces of Arab nationalism and the imperialism of the Zionist camp. The attempt by some Western countries to portray the issue as part of the Cold War is merely a smokescreen to conceal their opposition to Syria and its free policies, and to obstruct the UN from establishing a commission of inquiry to clarify the Turkish-Syrian border issue. In this regard, he criticized American policy.

Bitar stressed that the causes of the crisis on the Syrian-Turkish border have not disappeared. Listing and retaining Syria’s complaint on the agenda of the UN General Assembly is a form of monitoring of anything that happens on the Syrian-Turkish border. World public opinion should remain vigilant about dangerous developments.

Bitar stated that Syria did not agree to accept the UN Secretary-General's "mediation." Regarding Saudi Arabia’s “conciliation” proposal, it was merely being used to confuse the public. In reality, there are no disputes between Syria and Turkey that need mediation. Syria only hopes to eliminate the cause of the tension—the concentration of Turkish troops on the Turkish-Syrian border, which could be used as a means to force the Syrian government to change its policy course or as a means of direct aggression.

    联大结束叙利亚控诉案
    叙外长要土军撤离叙边境
    并表示没有同意接受联合国秘书长的“调停”
    据新华社2日讯　纽约消息：联合国大会全体会议在1日结束了叙利亚关于它的安全和国际和平遭受土耳其威胁的控诉案的讨论。叙利亚代表以及建议联合国秘书长在叙土之间进行“调停”的七国提案提议国的代表按照他们前一天在会外达成的协议，在会议上分别表示，他们都不坚持要通过他们所提出的提案。因此，会议没有进行表决。但是，按照叙利亚的意愿，这个问题仍然保留在联合国大会的议程中。
    会后，叙利亚外交部长比塔尔在记者招待会上发表声明和回答问题，申明叙利亚的立场。
    比塔尔指出，把土耳其威胁叙利亚的安全和国际和平的问题提到联合国，是为了要采取行动防止可能的侵略，因为土耳其向叙利亚边境集结军队，同时又进行宣传战。
    比塔尔着重指出，目前的问题，实质上是阿拉伯民族主义的争取解放的力量同犹太复国主义阵营的帝国主义之间的斗争。而西方某些国家把问题说成是冷战的一部分，只是为了要制造烟幕，以掩盖它们反对叙利亚及其自由政策的意图，并且阻挠联合国成立调查委员会来弄清土—叙边境问题。在这方面，他抨击了美国的政策。
    比塔尔强调：造成叙—土边境上的这次危机的原因还没有消失。把叙利亚控诉案列入和保留在联合国大会议程上，就是对在叙—土边境上发生的任何事情的一种监视。世界舆论应该对危险的发展情况继续保持警惕。
    比塔尔表示，叙利亚并没有表示同意接受联合国秘书长的“调停”。而关于沙特阿拉伯的“调解”建议，也不过是被利用来混淆视听而已。实际上，叙利亚和土耳其之间并没有什么争端需要进行调解。叙利亚只是希望消除造成紧张局势的原因——在土—叙边境上土耳其军队的集结，而这种集结可能作为迫使叙利亚政府改变政策路线的手段，也可能作为直接进行侵略的手段。
