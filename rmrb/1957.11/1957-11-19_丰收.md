    油茶
    湖南省七百多万亩油茶丰收。根据许多地区的典型调查，预计今年全省茶油产量将比去年增产一成以上。收成较好的湘西土家族苗族自治州，将产九万四千六百担，比大丰收的去年增产一成左右，比1952年增产约二倍。
    江西、广西两省今年油茶生产获得丰收。江西省六百万亩油茶林，现在已有四百万亩采摘了茶籽。预计今年能产五十万担茶油，比以往最高年产量增产一万担。这个省在解放以来垦复了二百零八万亩油茶山，垦复后的油茶林生长茂盛，结籽又多又壮实。
    广西省的茶籽也已开始收摘。据各地汇报材料估计：今年全省可收油茶两千六百多万斤，比去年增产70％。现在油茶区农民，一面采摘茶籽，一面在选种留种，为明年的生产作准备。（新华社）
