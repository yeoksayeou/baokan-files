Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, November 10th. The governments of the Soviet Union and India signed an agreement in New Delhi on November 9th regarding Soviet assistance to India in establishing certain publicly owned industrial enterprises and the Soviet Union granting a loan of 500 million rubles (approximately 600 million Indian rupees).

The Soviet loan will be used to build a heavy machinery manufacturing plant with an initial annual output of 45,000 tons, a coal mining machinery manufacturing plant with an annual output of 30,000 tons, a thermal power station with a power generation capacity of 250,000 kilowatts, an optical glass factory, as well as coal mining and coal washing enterprises.

The Soviet side will prepare detailed engineering reports for all these enterprises, and provide equipment, machinery and materials, technology and assistance.

The agreement also stipulates that necessary training facilities will be provided in the Soviet Union for Indian technical personnel needed for these projects.

The loan has an annual interest rate of 2.5%. The loan will be repaid within twelve years, starting one year after the complete delivery of Soviet machinery and equipment required for each enterprise.

The Soviet loan meets all of India's foreign exchange needs for establishing these enterprises. The agreement also stipulates that if the amount currently agreed upon for the above-mentioned purposes ultimately proves insufficient to establish these enterprises, the Soviet Union may provide additional loans in the future.

The Indian government's press bureau said in a press release: "The signing of this agreement will greatly help the Indian government save foreign exchange in the near future, and will promote the progress of the five-year plan currently being implemented. The establishment of these large-scale modern enterprises will enable India, for the first time, to organize the domestic production of heavy machinery and equipment necessary for the development of Indian industry, according to the goals of its Second Five-Year Plan."

Today, all major newspapers in the Indian capital carried this news on the front page with large headlines.

    苏联帮助印度建设重工业
    双方缔结贷款五亿卢布的协定
    新华社新德里10日电　苏联和印度两国政府11月9日在新德里签订了一项关于苏联帮助印度建立某些公营工业企业和苏联给予五亿卢布（约合六亿印度卢比）贷款的协定。
    苏联的贷款将用于建造一座初期年产四万五千吨的重型机械制造厂、一座年产三万吨的采煤机械制造厂、一座发电能力二十五万瓩的热电站、一座光学玻璃工厂，以及采煤和选煤企业。
    苏联方面将为所有这些企业准备详细的工程报告，并且提供设备、机器和材料、技术和援助。
    协定还规定在苏联为这些工程所需要的印度技术人员提供必要的训练便利。
    贷款年息是2．5％。贷款将从每一企业所需的苏联机器和设备全部交货后满一年之日起十二年内偿还。
    苏联的贷款满足了印度建立这些企业的全部外汇需要。协定中还规定，如果目前商定的用于上述目的的数目最后证明不足以建立这些企业的话，苏联将来还可以再给予贷款。
    印度政府新闻局的新闻公报说：“这个协定的签订会大大地帮助印度政府在最近的将来保存外汇，而且将推动目前在执行着的五年计划的进展。这些大规模现代化的企业的建立，将使印度第一次能够根据它的第二个五年计划的目标，来组织为发展印度工业所必需的重型机械和装备在本国的生产。”
    今天印度首都各主要报纸都在第一版以大字标题刊载了这个消息。
