Poems from the Countryside
The Bell
Dong Jinhuai
    On the old locust tree at the village entrance,
    Hangs a bomb casing,
    "USA" is its mark,
    Brought here by an American plane.
    It once carried unexploded, deep-seated evil,
    Deeply embedded in the soil.
    One year, two years, three years...
    People dug it up from underground again.
    Dug it up and hung it at the village entrance as a bell.
    The bell rings at dawn,
    Hoe shadows wave in the colorful morning light;
    The bell rings at dusk,
    Lights gleam red on the path to the people's school.
                (Jiangsu Haizhou)

    Every Piece is the Collective's Field Li Mou
    East and west are planted with autumn crops,
    South and north are planted with cotton;
    The autumn fields are lush and green,
    Cotton flowers are bright red.
    Collective members are all happy.
    Sorghum looks like a blazing fire,
    Millet droops its head, broomcorn bends,
    Corn wears three strands of silk,
    Cotton bolls grow in whole bunches.
    Collective members are never idle in the fields.
    Large piece after large piece,
    Every piece is the collective's field;
    All sides are years of harvest,
    Large carts haul, shoulders carry,
    Collective members complete the autumn harvest on time. (Shaanxi Qian County)
        Pain and Happiness　Feng Cun
    A peasant,
    Asks his son for guidance,
    "Child, how are 'pain' and 'happiness' written?
    Write them for Dad."
    "Dad, I have a suggestion for you,
    Why didn't you study hard when you were little?
    You still ask me about such words!"
    Dad doesn't speak,
    Thinking about his own painful past and his child's happy childhood.
        Manure Ladle　Wang Chunhu
    The manure cart sways in the morning breeze,
    There's a strange thing on the cart.
    The long handle is already dark,
    Holding a special iron ladle,
    Clearly a "steel helmet",
    Faintly visible are some traces?
    I looked at the cart driver's crippled leg,
    And gently called out to him:
    Comrade, why not hand in military supplies to the state,
    But instead squander them casually?
    He turned his head and laughed loudly,
    Revealing a mocking expression;
    "This thing has followed me through thousands of mountains and rivers,
    It's a souvenir, it's from 'USA'!"
    "It has three holes pierced by me,
    Just enough to thread a rope and hang it on my waist;
    It followed me across the '38th parallel',
    And came with me to the agricultural collective."

    来自农村的诗
    钟
    董金淮
    村口老槐树上，
    挂着颗炸弹壳，
    USA是它的标记，
    运它来的是美国飞机。
    它曾带着没有炸出的深沉罪恶，
    深深地陷进泥土里。
    一年、两年、三年……
    人们又把它从地下挖起。
    挖起挂在村口当口钟。
    钟声响在黎明，
    五彩霞光里锄影挥动；
    钟声响在黄昏，
    去民校的小路上灯光闪红。
                （江苏海州）
    片片都是社里田	李谋
    东面西面种秋田，
    南面北面种成棉；
    秋田片片绿湛湛，
    棉的花儿红艳艳。
    社员个个心喜欢。
    高粱好像红火般，
    谷子垂头糜?偏，
    玉米身带三把线，
    棉桃结的整串串。
    社员田里不得闲。
    大片大片连大片，
    片片都是社里田；
    四面都是丰收年，
    大车拉来担子担，
    社员按时秋收完。	（陕西乾县）
        痛苦和幸福	　冯村
    一个庄稼汉，
    请教在儿子面前，
    “孩子，‘痛苦’和‘幸福’都怎样写？
    你给爸爸写写看。”
    “爸爸，我给你提个意见，
    你小时候为什么不好好念书？
    这样的字还来问俺！”
    爸爸不发言，
    思想着自己过去痛苦的和现在孩子幸福的童年。
        粪瓢	　王纯嘏
   大粪车在晨风里摇移，
    车上有件古怪的东西。
    长长的把子已经黝黑，
    夹着一个特殊的铁瓢，
    明明是一只“钢盔”，
    隐隐地还可见一串什么痕迹？
    我看了看赶车人腿上的残废，
    轻轻地叫他声：
    同志，军用品为啥不交给国家，
    却随随便便地糟踏呢？
    他回头哈哈大笑起来，
    露出一副嘲弄的神气；
    “这玩意跟我走过千山万水，
    是纪念，是‘USA’的”！
    “它被我打穿了三个窟窿，
    刚好穿个绳挂在腰里；
    跟我走过‘三八线’，
    随我来到农业社里。”
