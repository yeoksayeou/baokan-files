Our country is a socialist country, and our construction is planned construction. The production and construction work of all regions and enterprises throughout the country must obey the unified plan of the state and must not violate the unified plan of the state. Our current industrial management system basically meets this requirement. However, judging from the current situation, there are two main shortcomings in the current industrial management system: one is that some enterprises are suitable for local management but are still directly managed by the central industrial departments; at the same time, local administrative organs have too little authority in industrial management in terms of material distribution, financial management, personnel management, etc. The other is that enterprise managers have too little management authority over their own enterprises, and industrial administrative departments manage too much of the business in the enterprises. These two main shortcomings limit the initiative and enthusiasm of local administrative organs and enterprise managers in their work. Within the unified plan of the state, it is absolutely necessary to give local governments and enterprises a certain degree of power to adapt to local conditions. This certain degree of flexible power for local governments and enterprises within the scope of the state's unified plan is precisely for completing the state's unified plan in accordance with local conditions, which is necessary for the state's unified plan. In order to appropriately expand the authority of local governments in industrial management and the management authority of enterprise managers over the internal affairs of enterprises, the State Council hereby makes the following regulations.

First, Appropriately Expand the Authority of Provinces, Autonomous Regions, and Municipalities Directly Under the Central Government to Manage Industry

I. Adjust the affiliation of existing enterprises and transfer some of the enterprises currently directly managed by the central government to provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government for leadership, as local enterprises.

Enterprises currently under the Ministry of Light Industry and the Ministry of Food Industry, except for a few enterprises that must be managed by the central government, most of the enterprises should be transferred to the provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government for management. The textile industry should first transfer a small portion, and then determine the steps for transferring most of it based on the specific situation.

Enterprises under the heavy industry departments, all those that belong to large mines, large metallurgical enterprises, large chemical enterprises, important coal bases, large power grids, large power stations, oil extraction and refining enterprises, large and precision machinery, electrical machinery and instrument factories, military industry, and other technically complex industries, will still be managed by the central industrial departments. Except for these, other factories that can be transferred should be gradually transferred according to the situation.

All enterprises under the Ministry of Forestry, except for individual units that need to be directly managed by the ministry, will be transferred.

A portion of the ports and enterprises managed by the Ministry of Communications will be transferred.

The civil construction part of construction enterprises should be gradually transferred in many areas and managed uniformly by the local authorities.

The central industrial and transportation departments concerned should, in accordance with the above principles, consult with local governments, propose a list of enterprises to be transferred, report to the State Council for approval, and then implement the transfer.

All enterprises that are still under the jurisdiction of the central ministries should implement the dual leadership of the central ministries as the mainstay and the central and local authorities, and strengthen the leadership and supervision of local authorities over the enterprises under the central ministries.

II. Increase the authority of the People's Committees of the provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government in material distribution.

The materials needed by the three aspects of enterprises under the central ministries, enterprises under local authorities (including local public-private joint ventures), and the commercial system, whether they are materials under the unified national distribution managed by the State Economic Commission (hereinafter referred to as unified distribution materials) or materials under the unified distribution managed by the central ministries (hereinafter referred to as ministry-managed materials), should still be applied for and distributed according to the original system. The materials needed by local state-owned and local public-private joint ventures should be applied for and distributed uniformly by the provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government. However, the People's Committees of the provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government have the right, within the scope of the provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government, to adjust the quantity, variety, and timing of the materials applied for and distributed by central enterprises, local enterprises, and local commercial organs for their own production and operation, based on the local situation and the urgency of needs, between various enterprises, on the condition of ensuring the completion of the state plan; enterprises of all systems must obey this adjustment.

The materials owned by the central ministries that are supplied to the whole country, whether stored in enterprises or warehouses in a certain place, cannot generally be transferred or used by the local provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government. If the local government requests to transfer them, it must obtain the consent of the central competent department. When the local government requests to transfer special raw materials used for military products, it must also obtain the consent of the central competent department.

If the production quantity of unified distribution materials and ministry-managed materials produced by enterprises managed by provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government exceeds the quantity stipulated in the national plan, the local government can retain a certain proportion of the excess for its own use, but the original planned variety cannot be changed. For the products exceeding the plan of enterprises under the central ministries, the local government can also share a proportion approved by the central government, except for a small number of enterprises and a small number of product varieties designated by the central government.

When provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government require the mechanical manufacturing enterprises under the central ministries to produce beyond the plan, in order to avoid blind increases in production, if the varieties produced beyond the plan fall under the unified distribution of the State Economic Commission or within the scope of ministry management, the consent of the relevant central mechanical industry departments is required.

III. Of all the profits of enterprises that were originally managed by the central ministries but are now transferred to the local government for management, 20 percent belongs to the local authorities and 80 percent belongs to the central government.

Local governments do not participate in profit sharing for enterprises under the Second Ministry of Machine Building Industry, the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, the Ministry of Railways, the foreign sales part of the Ministry of Foreign Trade, and the Civil Aviation Administration, as well as large mines, large metallurgical enterprises, large chemical enterprises, large coal mines, large power grids, oil extraction and refining, large machinery and electrical machinery manufacturing enterprises, and shipping enterprises operating across provinces along the Yangtze River and the coast; except for these, local governments can also share 20 percent of all the profits of other enterprises that are still under the management of the central ministries, such as textile enterprises.

For all enterprises in which local governments participate in profit sharing, the above-mentioned 20-80 profit sharing ratio will remain unchanged for three years.

All profits of enterprises that were originally managed by local authorities will still belong to the local government.

IV. In terms of personnel management, increase the management authority of local authorities. All enterprises that are transferred by the central ministries to the local government for management should be handled in accordance with local enterprises in terms of personnel management. The provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government can make appropriate adjustments to all cadres of enterprises that are still under the jurisdiction of the central ministries, without weakening the main factories and mines. However, when local authorities request to transfer cadres within the scope of the State Council's management, they should report to the State Council for approval. When local authorities transfer cadres within the scope of the management of the competent industrial departments, they should consult with the competent departments. When transferring cadres, especially senior technical personnel, attention should be paid to the original specialty of the cadres and consideration should be given to the stability of certain cadres in their work positions for a certain period of time.

The central ministries' enterprises and management institutions stationed in various places should be subject to the leadership and supervision of the local People's Committees regarding staffing and establishment work.

Second, Appropriately Expand the Management Authority of Enterprise Managers over the Internal Affairs of Enterprises

I. Reduce mandatory targets in plan management and expand the responsibilities of enterprise managers for plan management.

In terms of production plans, the original mandatory targets stipulated by the State Council that could not be changed without the approval of the State Council were twelve in total, namely: total output value, output of major products, trial production of new types of products, important technical and economic quotas, cost reduction rate, cost reduction amount, total number of employees, number of workers at the end of the year, total wage amount, average wage, labor productivity, and profit. Now the mandatory targets of the State Council are reduced to four, namely: (1) output of major products, (2) total number of employees, (3) total wage amount, and (4) profit. The remaining eight targets are, in general, regarded as non-mandatory targets. These non-mandatory targets should still be fully included in the plan when issuing and reporting the plan, just like the four mandatory targets, as a basis for calculation, but enterprises can modify them according to the actual situation during implementation. The revised plan for non-mandatory targets should be reported to the relevant departments and bureaus for the record.

In addition to the four mandatory targets stipulated by the State Council, the industrial ministries can add individual mandatory targets according to the special needs of the enterprises, such as trial production of new types of products, important technical and economic quotas, cost reduction rate, etc. The People's Committees of the provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government can also add individual mandatory targets to their subordinate enterprises according to local needs, such as stipulating the output of a certain product that is balanced within the scope of the province, autonomous region, or municipality directly under the Central Government.

In terms of basic construction plans, the mandatory targets stipulated by the State Council in 1957 are four, namely: (1) total investment amount, (2) projects above the limit, (3) utilization of production capacity, and (4) construction and installation workload. These four mandatory targets will continue to be implemented in the future. The labor and wage targets of the construction and installation departments should still be handled in accordance with past regulations. The provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government can adjust the projects, construction progress, etc., for the use of local basic construction investment, within the total amount of local investment approved by the State Council, on the condition of ensuring the completion of the above-mentioned mandatory targets.

The national plan only stipulates the annual plan. The competent departments should decide which enterprises should have quarterly and monthly plans stipulated by the competent departments and which enterprises should formulate them themselves, based on the specific situation.

Simplify the plan preparation procedure. Change the current two-time issuance and two-time reporting preparation process to two-time issuance and one-time reporting, that is, first issue control figures from top to bottom, then prepare draft plans from bottom to top, and finally issue plans from top to bottom. Efforts should be made to roughly determine the annual plan by November of the previous year, and the plan will generally not be modified after it is issued. Resolutely streamline the current forms and reports.

II. The state and enterprises implement profit sharing, and improve the enterprise's financial management system. The enterprise's profits are fully shared by the state and the enterprise. The base for sharing is based on the four expenses received by the industrial departments during the first five-year plan period (technical and organizational measures expenses, new product trial production expenses, labor protection expenses, and miscellaneous purchase expenses), plus the enterprise bonus fund, plus 40 percent of the over-planned profits. The ratio of the three incomes received by the various ministries to the total profits turned over by the industrial departments in the same period is calculated separately on a ministry basis. For example, if the three incomes received by the industrial ministries account for a certain percentage of the profits turned over by the industrial ministry, this percentage will be used as the fixed sharing ratio of the industrial ministry. In future annual budgets, the state will no longer allocate the four expenses and enterprise bonus funds. All these expenses will be solved from the fixed profit sharing. After the sharing ratio is determined, it will remain unchanged for three years. The sharing amount is calculated annually based on the realized profits. The industrial ministries determine different sharing ratios for their subordinate enterprises based on the above principles and specific circumstances, so as to realize the profit sharing between the state and the enterprise. However, the industrial ministries can concentrate a part of all the sharing income of their directly affiliated enterprises for inter-enterprise adjustment. The industrial management departments of the provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government can also extract a part of the profit sharing obtained by their directly affiliated enterprises (including enterprises transferred from the central government) for local inter-enterprise adjustment.

If the trial production cost of new products in national defense enterprises, as well as the trial production cost of new products of special importance in other enterprises, exceeds the enterprise's ability to bear, the competent department will allocate it separately.

Because public-private joint ventures did not have the same regulations as state-owned enterprises in the past for the four expenses, enterprise bonus funds, and over-planned profit sharing, and public-private joint ventures are mostly small and medium-sized enterprises, special research should be conducted on the sharing base and sharing methods of public-private joint ventures when implementing enterprise profit sharing, and appropriate methods should be formulated.

When enterprises use their shared income, they must use most of it for production and business aspects, and at the same time, appropriately take care of the welfare of employees.

Abolish some of the current unreasonable regulations, such as the regulations that major repairs are not allowed to "deform" or "increase in value." The enterprise's operating expenses can be adjusted by the enterprise among the items within the total amount of operating expenses, on the condition of ensuring the completion of the plan. The enterprise's fixed assets can be increased, decreased, or scrapped by the enterprise within the limits prescribed by the higher authorities.

III. Improve the enterprise's personnel management system. Except for the enterprise's responsible managers (factory director, deputy factory director, manager, deputy manager, etc.) and key technical personnel, all other employees are managed by the enterprise.

The enterprise has the right to adjust its organization and personnel without increasing the total number of employees.

    国务院关于改进工业管理体制的规定
    我国是社会主义的国家，我国的建设是有计划的建设，全国各地区各企业的生产和建设工作都必须服从国家的统一计划，决不可以违反国家的统一计划。我们现行的工业管理体制基本上是符合这种要求的。但是，从目前情况看来，现行工业管理体制存在着两个主要的缺点：一个是有些企业适宜于交给地方管理的，现在还由中央工业部门直接管理；同时地方行政机关对于工业管理中的物资分配、财务管理、人事管理等等方面的职权太小。另一个是企业主管人员对于本企业的管理权限太小，工业行政部门对于企业中的业务管得过多。这两个主要缺点限制了地方行政机关和企业主管人员在工作方面的主动性和积极性。在国家的统一计划以内，给地方政府和企业以一定程度的因地制宜的权力，是完全必要的。这种国家统一计划范围内的地方政府和企业的一定程度的机动权力，正是为了因地制宜地完成国家的统一计划，这是国家统一计划所必需的。为了适当地扩大地方政府在工业管理方面的权限和企业主管人员对企业内部的管理权限，国务院现作下列的规定。
    第一、适当扩大省、自治区、直辖市管理工业的权限
    一、调整现有企业的隶属关系，把目前由中央直接管理的一部分企业，下放给省、自治区、直辖市领导，作为地方企业。
    现在属于轻工业部和食品工业部的企业，除了若干企业必须由中央管理的以外，大部分企业都下放给省、自治区、直辖市管理。纺织工业先下放一小部分，以后根据具体情况，再定大部分下放的步骤。
    重工业各部门所属的企业，凡是属于大型矿山、大型冶金企业、大型化工企业、重要煤炭基地、大电力网、大电站、石油采炼企业、大型和精密的机器、电机和仪表工厂、军事工业以及其他技术复杂的工业，仍旧归中央各工业部门管理。除此以外，其他工厂凡属可以下放的，都应该根据情况，逐步下放。
    森林工业部所属的企业，除个别单位需要由部直接管理的以外，其余全部下放。
    交通部管理的一部分港口和企业下放。
    建筑企业中的土建部分，在许多地区应该逐步下放，由地方统一管理。
    中央各有关的工业、交通部门，应该根据上述原则，同地方政府协商，提出下放企业的名单，报告国务院批准以后，实行下放。
    一切仍归中央各部管辖的企业，都实行以中央各部为主的中央和地方的双重领导，加强地方对中央各部所属企业的领导和监督。
    二、增加各省、自治区、直辖市人民委员会在物资分配方面的权限。
    中央各部所属企业、地方所属企业（包括地方所属的公私合营企业）和商业系统这三个方面所需要的物资，不论是国家经济委员会所管的全国统一分配的物资（以下简称统配物资）或者是中央各部所管的统一分配物资（以下简称部管物资），仍旧各按原来系统申请和分配。地方国营、地方公私合营企业所需要的物资由省、自治区、直辖市统一申请和分配。但是，省、自治区、直辖市人民委员会，对于在省、自治区、直辖市范围以内的中央企业、地方企业和地方商业机关为本企业生产经营所申请分配的物资，在保证完成国家计划的条件下，有权根据当地的情况和需要的缓急，在各个企业之间进行数量、品种和使用时间方面的调剂；各个系统的企业，都要服从这种调剂。
    中央各部所有的供应全国需要的物资，不论是存放在某地企业内的或者是仓库中的，当地省、自治区、直辖市一般不能调动使用。如果当地政府要求调用，必须取得中央主管部门的同意。军用产品所用的特殊原材料，地方政府要求调用的时候，也必须取得中央主管部门的同意。
    省、自治区、直辖市管理的企业所生产的统配物资和部管物资，如果生产数量超过了国家计划规定数量，超过计划的部分，当地政府可以按照一定比例提成，自行支配使用，但是原定的品种计划不能改变。中央各部所属企业的超过计划的产品，除了中央指定的少数企业和少数产品品种以外，地方政府也可以按照中央批准的比例分成。
    各省、自治区、直辖市要求中央各部所属机械制造企业超额生产时，为了避免盲目增产，其超额生产的品种，如果属于国家经济委员会统一分配或者在部管范围内的，需要得到中央各有关机械工业部门的同意。
    三、原来属于中央各部管理现在下放给地方政府管理的企业，全部利润的百分之二十归地方所得，百分之八十归中央所得。
    凡是属于第二机械工业部、邮电部、铁道部、对外贸易部外销部分和民航局等部门的企业和大型矿山、大型冶金、大型化工、大型煤矿、大电力网、石油采炼、大型机器和电机的制造等企业以及长江、沿海跨省经营的航运企业，地方政府不参与利润分成；除此以外，所有仍旧属于中央各部管理的其他企业，例如纺织企业，地方政府也可以分得全部利润的百分之二十。
    所有地方政府参与利润分成的企业，上述规定的二八分成的比例，三年不变。
    凡是属于原来由地方管理的企业，其全部利润，仍旧归地方政府所得。
    四、在人事管理方面，增加地方的管理权限。凡是属于中央各部下放给地方政府管理的企业，在人事管理方面，都按照地方企业办理。各省、自治区、直辖市对仍归中央各部管辖的企业的所有干部，在不削弱主要厂矿的条件下，可以进行适当地调整。但是，国务院管理范围的干部，地方要求调动的时候，应该报请国务院批准。各主管工业部门管理范围的干部，地方调动的时候，应该同主管部门协商。在调动干部尤其是调动高级技术人员的时候，应该注意干部原来的专业，照顾到某些干部在他的工作岗位上要有一定期间的稳定性。
    中央各部所属的企业和分驻各地的管理机构，有关编制定员工作，应该受当地人民委员会的领导和监督。
    第二、适当扩大企业主管人员对企业内部的管理权限
    一、在计划管理方面减少指令性的指标，扩大企业主管人员对计划管理的职责。
    在生产计划方面，原来由国务院规定的非经国务院批准不得改变的指令性的指标共有十二个，即：总产值、主要产品产量、新种类产品试制、重要的技术经济定额、成本降低率、成本降低额、职工总数、年底工人到达数、工资总额、平均工资、劳动生产率、利润。现在把国务院指令性的指标减为四个，即：（一）主要产品产量，（二）职工总数，（三）工资总额，（四）利润。其余八个指标，在一般情况下，都作为非指令性的指标。这些非指令性的指标，在下达计划和上报计划的时候，仍旧和四个指令性指标一样，全部列入计划，作为计算根据，但是，企业在执行中可以依据实际情况进行修改。对于非指令性指标的修改以后的方案，应该报告有关部、局备案。
    除了国务院规定的四个指令性的指标以外，各工业部可以根据企业的特殊需要，增加个别指令性的指标，例如新种类产品试制、重要技术经济定额、成本降低率等等。各省、自治区、直辖市人民委员会也可以根据当地需要，对自己所属企业增加个别指令性的指标，例如规定在省、自治区、直辖市范围内平衡的某种产品的产量。
    在基本建设计划方面，国务院一九五七年规定的指令性指标是四个，即：（一）总投资额，（二）限额以上项目，（三）动用生产能力，（四）建筑安装工作量。今后仍旧按照这四个指令性指标执行。建筑安装部门的劳动工资指标，仍旧按照过去规定办理。各省、自治区、直辖市对于地方基本建设投资的使用，在保证完成上述指令性指标的条件下，在国务院核定的地方投资总额以内，可以对建设项目、建设进度等等方面进行调剂。
    国家计划只规定年度计划。关于季度、月度计划，那些企业应该由主管的部、局规定，那些企业应该由企业自行制定，都由各主管部门根据具体情况，作出决定。
    简化计划编制程序。由现行的两次下达、两次上报的编制过程改为两次下达、一次上报，就是先由上而下的颁发控制数字，然后由下而上的编制计划草案，最后由上而下的下达计划。年度计划力求在年前十一月份大致确定，计划下达以后，一般不再修改。坚决精简现行表报。
    二、国家和企业实行利润分成，改进企业的财务管理制度。企业的利润，由国家和企业实行全额分成。分成的基数根据各工业部门第一个五年计划期间领取的四项费用（技术组织措施费用、新种类产品试制费用、劳动保护费用、零星购置费用），加上企业奖励基金，再加上百分之四十的超计划利润，把各部所领取的这三笔收入与工业部门在同一时期所实现的全部上缴利润，以部为单位，分别算出比例。例如各工业部所领取的三笔收入共占各该工业部上缴利润的百分之几，就把这个比例分别作为各工业部的固定分成比例。以后年度预算中，国家不再拨付四项费用和企业奖励基金，所有这些费用，统由利润固定分成中解决。分成比例确定以后，三年不变。每年根据实现的利润，计算分成数额。各工业部对于所属企业根据上述原则和具体情况，分别确定各个不同的分成比例，实现国家和企业在利润方面的分成。但是，各工业部可以在自己直属各企业的全部分成所得中集中一部分作为企业间调剂之用。各省、自治区、直辖市的工业管理部门也可以在它直属企业（包括中央下放企业）所得的利润分成中，抽出一部分，作为当地各企业间调剂之用。
    国防企业中新种类产品试制费用，以及其他企业的特殊重要的新种类产品的试制费用，如果超过本企业负担能力，由主管部门另行拨付。
    因为公私合营企业过去对四项费用、企业奖励基金、超计划利润分成等等没有像国营企业那样的规定，而且公私合营企业中以中小型企业为多，因此在实行企业的利润分成的时候，应该对公私合营企业的分成基数和分成办法，进行专门研究，定出适宜的办法。
    企业在使用分成所得的时候，必须把其中的大部分用于生产事业方面，同时，适当地照顾到职工福利方面。
    取消现行的某些不合理的规定，例如大修理不准“变形”、“增值”等规定。企业的事业费在保证完成计划的条件下，可以由企业在事业费总额内的项目之间调剂使用。企业的固定资产在上级规定的权限内，可以由企业增减或者报废。
    三、改进企业的人事管理制度，除企业主管负责人员（厂长、副厂长、经理、副经理等）、主要技术人员以外，其他一切职工均由企业负责管理。
    企业有权在不增加职工总数的条件下，自行调整机构和人员。
