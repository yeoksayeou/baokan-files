Editor's Note: The fabric-saving clothing cutting patterns introduced here are designed by comrades from the Beijing Garment Production Cooperative Union Research Institute. Since starting this work in September of this year, they have created more than one hundred sets of fabric-saving single-garment cutting methods. These include men's and women's cadre uniforms, student uniforms, youth clothing, children's clothing, shirts, and undershirts, as well as various women's clothing such as dresses. These garments not only adhere to the principle of saving fabric, but are also simple to cut and make.

They are now teaching these methods to various grassroots cooperatives; and are rushing to make clothes according to these methods, preparing to open an exhibition in mid-November to invite colleagues and customers to visit and offer suggestions for improvement. All fabric-saving cutting patterns have also been sent to the Beijing Publishing House to be edited into a book, which will be published within the year.

This research institute was only established in January of this year. Establishing a garment research institute is a pioneering undertaking in China. This research institute has a total of thirteen people, most of whom are tailors with two or thirty years of experience. They have also published several related books.

3.  7 feet of fabric to make a women's shirt

Explanation: This is a women's shirt with a closed square collar, raglan sleeves, and patch pockets made of floral blistered cotton with a relatively narrow width (64 cm, i.e. 1.92 feet) (if the fabric is wider, even less material will be used). The collar is single-layered (saving 10 cm, i.e. more than 3 inches, compared to a double layer). Lace can be added around the collar, cuffs, and pocket openings. A one or two-inch opening can be made at the shoulder of the cuff, so that when you raise your hand, it doesn't ride up like a regular shirt.

1.  8 feet of fabric to make a pair of men's underwear
2.  5 feet of fabric to make a pair of women's underwear

Explanation: The following two charts are for men's and women's western-style underwear made of bleached cotton 80 cm (i.e. 2.4 feet) wide.

In the men's underwear diagram, 1, 2, and 3 are the body of the pants; 4 is the scrap material, which can be used to make the facing for the fly.

In the women's underwear diagram, 1, 2, and 3 are the body of the pants; 4 is the facing for the fly; 5 is the scrap material, which can be used to make the facing for the elastic band. (Attached pictures)

### 向主妇们介绍几种省布的裁剪图样

    向主妇们介绍几种省布的裁剪图样
    编者按：这里介绍的几个省布的服装裁剪图样，是北京服装生产合作联社研究所的同志设计的。他们从今年9月份开始这件工作以来，已创造出一百多套省布的单服裁剪法。其中有男女干部服、学生服、青年服、童装、衬衫衬裤，还有各种妇女服装如布拉吉等。这些服装不仅合乎节约用布原则，而且裁剪、制作也简便。
    现在他们正在给各基层社传授这些方法；并正在按照这些方法赶制衣服，预备在11月中旬开一个展览会，请同行及顾客参观和提意见，以便改进设计。所有省布裁剪法的图样，也已送到北京出版社编辑成书，年内可出版。
    这个研究所是今年1月才成立的。成立服装研究所，在中国还是创举。这个研究所共十三人，大都是有着二、三十年工龄的裁缝，他们还曾出过几本有关的图书。3．7尺布做一件女衬衣
    说明：这是用布面比较窄（64公分，即1．92尺）的花泡泡纱做成的关门方领、连袖、贴袋女衬衣（如果布面宽，用料当更省）。领子是单层（比双层省布10公分即3寸多）。领子周围及袖口、袋口可镶花边。袖口上肩处可开一、二寸缝口，这样抬手时不至于像一般衬衫那样上掀。
    1．8尺布做一条男内裤
    1．5尺布做一条女内裤
    说明：下面这两张图表都是用八十公分（即2．4尺）宽的漂白布做成的男女西式内裤。
    男内裤图中1、2、3是裤身；4是零料，可做开门明里襟。
    女内裤图中1、2、3是裤身；4是开门贴边；5是零料，可做穿松紧带的贴边。（附图片）
