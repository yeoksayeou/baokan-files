    "We Received the Benefits of the 'Forty Articles'"
    – Experience in Increasing Production at Changfeng Agricultural Cooperative, Xiaogan County
    Wang Jiaji, First Secretary of the Xiaogan Prefectural Committee
    The Changfeng Agricultural Cooperative in Pengxing Township, Xiaogan County, led by Guan Musheng, achieved an average yield of 1,011 jin per mu in 1956, an increase of 72% compared to 1955. This year's estimated yield is 1,160 jin. Preliminary plans call for 1,500 jin by 1967. When discussing the Forty Articles of the National Programme for Agricultural Development (Revised Draft), cooperative member Guan Shaoming said, "Of all the thousands of articles, it boils down to one – we cannot depart from the leadership of the Communist Party; we have received the benefits of the 'Forty Articles.'"
    Based on the goals and measures for increasing production outlined in the National Programme for Agricultural Development, the Changfeng Agricultural Cooperative implemented a major reform of its cropping system. One of the cooperative's experiences in increasing production is that it seized upon the rice cropping system reform, which had great potential for increasing production, as the central link, expanded the area of multiple cropping, improved varieties, and actively and steadily promoted japonica rice, adapting to local conditions. In 1952, the area of double-cropping rice accounted for only 1.68% of the cooperative's total area; in 1956, it increased to 16%; and this year it reached 40%. The land multiple cropping index has reached 241.5% this year, resulting in a large increase in yield. Members reflected, "One year is equivalent to two years of harvest, and after eating the first season, there is still autumn," "There is no bare land in mid-autumn, everywhere is green, this is something that has never happened before."
    Before cooperation, why did no one dare to plant double-cropping rice on a large scale or switch to improved varieties? Cooperative member Guan Dengshou put it well: "When we were working individually, we had little strength, poor water sources, and a lack of fertilizer. We were afraid of autumn droughts, pests, and lean years. If something went wrong, how could small households bear it?"
    Cooperation effectively overcame many contradictions. The Changfeng Cooperative carried out large-scale water conservancy construction, increasing water storage by 110% compared to 1952.
    In addition to repairing water conservancy facilities, the Changfeng Cooperative also paid great attention to accumulating fertilizer. In the past, when working individually, 20% of the fields were not fertilized, and 50% were under-fertilized. Although there were decades' worth of pond mud and old wall soil, it was impossible to utilize them. After cooperation, the cooperative organized large-scale fertilizer accumulation movements throughout the year. By adjusting the price of household fertilizer and allocating fertilizer accumulation tasks, the enthusiasm of the members for accumulating fertilizer was fully utilized. The whole cooperative launched "three clearances" (clear pond mud, clear weeds, clear mud from ditches) and "five haves" (cows have pens, pigs have sties, chickens and ducks have cages, toilets have lids, sewage has buckets) and "five moves" (cellars, topsoil, chicken coops, old wall soil, cattle pens) to accumulate and preserve fertilizer, plus planting green manure, solved 74% of the fertilizer demand.
    Rice stem borers are the great enemy of double-cropping rice production. The Changfeng Cooperative has basically eliminated stem borer damage. They implemented the policy of "prevention is more important than treatment," put forward the slogan of "eliminate stem borers, fight for grain with insects," and adopted long-term pest control measures. Last winter's "three clearances" (clear rice stubble, clear weeds from field ridges, clear slopes) stem borer removal campaign eliminated more than 80% of the overwintering stem borers. At the beginning of spring plowing this year, seed dressing, spraying, and moth trapping campaigns were continuously adopted, and the stem borer damage rate has dropped from 18% in 1955 to below 1%.
    Planting according to local conditions, acting according to one's ability, and rationally matching varieties are important experiences for the Changfeng Cooperative to ensure annual production increases. Starting with winter sowing, annual and two-year planting plans are arranged at the same time. Winter sowing is subordinate to spring sowing, taking care of the current year and looking after the coming year, and calculating five accounts according to needs and possibilities (manpower, livestock, water, fertilizer, time): For example, the yield of single-season late japonica rice is high, but the growth period is long, the water demand is large, and it is afraid of autumn drought, so the "five rely" method (rely on ports, rely on reservoirs, rely on wells, rely on large ponds, rely on village side) was used to plant more than 400 mu. Even in the case of more than 40 days of autumn drought this year, it can guarantee a bumper harvest. Matching early rice varieties with different maturity periods can regulate labor and seize the favorable time.
    The Changfeng Cooperative actively promotes advanced technology and strengthens intensive cultivation. For example, the implementation of staggered transplanting completely avoids the danger of a large reduction in production due to transplanting old seedlings. Another example is rational close planting, so that the average planting density reaches about 34,000 seedlings per mu, an increase of about 10,000 seedlings compared to before liberation. Now, it has become a common practice in the Changfeng Cooperative to learn advanced technology.
    The members of the Changfeng Cooperative describe intensive cultivation in this way: "One plow is equal to one application of fertilizer; fields must be deeply ploughed, and children must be born personally." After cooperation, the amount of labor per mu of land in the Changfeng Cooperative has increased from 14 labor days in the past to 27 labor days (single-season rice). In the past, 20% of the backward fields, called "Taiwan fields" by the masses, had very low yields. After cooperation, through intensive cultivation and sufficient base fertilizer, the yield per mu of rice last year was more than 700 jin. This year, double-cropping rice was planted, and each mu can harvest about 1,100 jin. Members reflected that "cooperation has liberated people, and the land has also been liberated."
    Cultivating high-yielding fields while increasing production in a balanced way is the Changfeng Cooperative's greatest asset for breaking the conservative thinking of members who annually feel that "production has reached the top." Cooperative and team cadres personally engage in experimental fields. Improved varieties and advanced cultivation methods all have experimental fields. When the experiment is successful, visits and demonstrations are organized, which has a great effect. Last year, 5.12 mu of double-thousand-jin grain fields were cultivated, and this year, 120 mu of high-yielding grain fields with double-thousand-jin planned. Members call experimental fields "locomotives" and "models." This also avoids coercion and blindness, greatly stimulating the enthusiasm of cooperative cadres and members to study production technology.
    Cooperative cadres participating in production and leading production, especially personally cultivating experimental fields to demonstrate to the masses, is the basic key to the Changfeng Cooperative's ability to smoothly promote various production increase measures and achieve a great harvest. The majority of cooperative and team cadres, led by Cooperative Director Guan Musheng, have not changed their labor nature for a long time, and their labor viewpoint is getting stronger day by day. The main cadres can go deep into the most difficult and important places, participate in production, and lead production. They understand very well that separation from production will lead to separation from the masses, and only by participating in production can they better lead production. Guan Musheng's love of labor has played an important role in inspiring the labor enthusiasm of cooperative and team cadres and members. When the cooperative cadres are at home, they squeeze out time every day to go to the team to produce, or engage in their own experimental fields.
    The Changfeng Cooperative still has some problems on the road forward. Due to the expansion of the multiple cropping area and the continuous increase in labor input, there is an urgent need to gradually improve agricultural tools and increase chemical fertilizers.
    When discussing the National Programme for Agricultural Development (Revised Draft), they requested to increase the number of flatbed trucks, water pumps, seeders, threshers, small rice milling machines, sewing machines, and sprayers. They calculated several accounts. If they improved transportation tools, increased eight water pumps, used threshers, and used machines to mill rice, they could save 40,400 workdays a year, accounting for 29.8% of the total workdays invested by the cooperative this year. They also requested that new-style agricultural machinery parts be sent to the countryside and that repair and fitting stations be established in the countryside.

    “我们得到了‘四十条’的好处”
    ——孝感县长风农业社增产经验
    孝感地委第一书记　王家吉
    湖北省孝感县朋兴乡官木生领导的长风农业社1956年全社平均产量为每亩一千零十一斤，比1955年增产72％。今年预计为一千一百六十斤。初步规划到1967年为一千五百斤。这个社在讨论农业发展纲要（修正草案）四十条的时候，社员官少明说，“千条百条，归总一条——不能离开共产党的领导，我们就是得了‘四十条’的好处。”
    长风农业社根据农业发展纲要指出的奋斗目标和增产措施，实行了耕作制度的重大改革。这个社的增产经验之一，是因地制宜地突出抓住了增产潜力很大的水稻改制这一中心环节，扩大了复种面积，改良了品种，积极而又稳步地推广了粳稻。1952年，这个社双季稻的面积只占1．68％，1956年扩大到16％，今年则达到40％，土地复种指数今年已达241．5％，因而产量大增。社员们反映：“一年抵了两年收，吃了头季还有秋”，“中秋无白地，遍地绿油油，这是古来没有的事”。
    合作化前，为什么没有人敢于大面积地种植双季稻和换用良种呢？社员官登寿说得好：“单干时，力量小，水源差，肥料缺，怕秋旱，怕虫害，怕瘦年，要是出了差错，小家小户怎样背得起呢？”
    合作化有力地克服了许多矛盾。长风社进行了大规模的水利建设，蓄水量比1952年增加了110％。
    除了修水利，长风社还非常注意积肥。过去单干时有20％的田不施肥，50％的施肥不足，虽有几十年的塘泥、陈壁土却没法利用。合作化后，社里长年大规模地组织了积肥动运。经过调整家肥价格和分配积肥任务，充分发挥了社员的积肥积极性。全社开展了“三光”（塘泥光、杂草光、阴沟阳沟污泥光）、“五有”（牛有栏、猪有圈、鸡鸭有笼、厕所有盖、污水有桶）、“五搬家”（窖、地皮、鸡笼、陈壁土、牛栏）的积肥、保肥工作，加上种植绿肥，解决了需肥量的74％。
    螟虫是双季稻增产的大敌。长风社已基本上消灭了螟害。他们执行了“防重于治”的方针，提出“消灭螟虫，与虫争粮”的口号，采取了长年的除虫防虫措施。去冬的“三光”（谷兜捡光、田埂草割光、坂田起光）除螟运动，越冬螟虫80％以上被消灭。今年春耕开始，又持续采取药剂拌种、喷治以及千灯万火的诱蛾运动，螟虫为害率已由1955年的18％下降到1％以下。
    因地种植，量力而为，合理搭配品种，是长风社保证年年增产的重要经验。从冬播开始，同时就安排好一年和两年的种植计划。冬播服从春播，当年照顾来年，根据需要与可能，算好五笔账
  （人、畜、水、肥、时间）：如一季晚粳产量高，但生长期长，需水量大，怕秋旱，就以“五靠”办法（靠港、靠水库、靠井、靠大塘、靠村旁），种了四百多亩。在今年秋旱四十多天的情况下，也能保证丰收。搭配好成熟期不同的早稻品种，可以调节劳力，抢住火色。
    长风社积极推广先进技术，加强精耕细作。如实行分期下秧，就完全避免了因栽老秧而大量减产的危险。又如合理密植，使栽秧密度平均每亩达三万四千蔸左右，比解放前增加一万蔸左右。现在，长风社学习先进技术，已经形成风气。
    长风社的社员们这样形容精耕细作：“一道犁头抵一道粪；田要深耕，儿要亲生”。合作化后，长风社每亩田的用工量，已由过去的十四个劳动日，增加到现在的二十七个劳动日（一季稻）。过去被群众叫做“台湾田”的20％的落后田，产量很低，合作化后，经过精耕细作，施足底肥；去年亩产稻谷七百多斤，今年改种双季稻，每亩可收一千一百斤左右了。社员反映说：“合作化人翻了身，田也翻了身”。
    在平衡增产的同时培养高额丰产田，这是长风社用以打破社员年年出现“增产到顶”的保守思想的最大资本。社队干部亲自搞试验田。优良品种和先进栽培方法，样样都有试验田。试验成功就组织参观示范，作用很大。去年培养了粮食双千斤田五点一二亩，今年计划双千斤粮食的高额丰产田一百二十亩。社员们称试验田为“火车头”，“样子”。这样作，也避免了强迫命令和盲目性，大大激发了社干、社员钻研生产技术的积极性。
    社干部参加生产、领导生产，特别是亲自培育试验田向群众示范，是长风社能够顺利推行各项增产措施，取得大丰收的基本关键。长风社以社长官木生为首的大多数社队干部，长期以来，劳动本色没有改变，劳动观点一天比一天强。主要干部能深入到最艰苦最重要的地方，参加生产，领导生产。他们十分懂得，脱离生产就会脱离群众，只有参加生产，才能更好地领导生产。官木生的热爱劳动，对鼓舞社、队干部和社员的劳动热情，起了重要的作用。社干部在家的时候，每天都挤出时间到队生产，或搞自己的试验田。
    长风社在前进的道路上还存在一些问题。由于复种面积扩大，劳动投放不断增加，所以迫切要求逐步改进农具，增加化肥。
    在讨论农业发展纲要（修正草案）的时候，他们要求增加一些板车、抽水机、播种机、脱粒机、小型碾米机、缝纫机和喷雾器等。他们算了几笔账，如果改良运输工具，增加八部抽水机，使用脱粒机，利用机器碾米，一年即可以省四万零四百个工，占今年全社投放总工数的29．8％。他们还要求新式农具零件下乡，和在农村建立修配站。
