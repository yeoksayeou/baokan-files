Xinhua News Agency, November 25th: According to TASS, experiments conducted by Soviet scientists have shown that adding antibiotics to livestock feed can make livestock grow faster and greatly reduce the mortality rate of young animals.

Soviet scientists conducted significant experiments with calves, adding antibiotics to their feed. After six weeks, these animals weighed an average of more than 10% more than calves fed ordinary feed. Pigs fed with antibiotic-added feed also increased in weight by 10% to 20%, while the survival rate of piglets reached 98% to 99%.

Experiments were also carried out on poultry. Chicks fed antibiotics weighed 10% to 15% more than chicks fed ordinary feed in the first twenty days after hatching. Penicillin was particularly effective, increasing the weight of chicks by 17% to 20%. The mortality rate of experimental chicks was one-third to one-half lower than that of ordinary chicks. Scientists also conducted experiments on wild animals. Adding aureomycin to the feed of female minks greatly increased the animals' reproductive capacity. The cubs they gave birth to were larger and did not die from disease.

The Soviet magazine "Science and Life" published an article on this issue written by Professor Leonov in its August issue this year. He pointed out that scientists are now engaged in seeking new antibiotics that are cheaper than drugs (such as penicillin and streptomycin) for large-scale use in animal husbandry. He said that something like "tea fungus" may become such a stimulant.

    苏联科学家实验证明
    幼畜饲料掺进抗生素能促进成长减少死亡
    新华社25日讯　据塔斯社报道，苏联科学家进行的实验表明，在牲畜饲料中掺进抗生素可以使牲畜更快地成长，幼畜的死亡率大大降低。
    苏联科学家用牛犊进行了有意义的实验，在它们的饲料里掺进抗生素。过了六个星期以后，这些牲畜的重量比吃普通饲料的牛犊平均超过10％。吃掺有抗生素饲料的猪的重量也多增加10％到20％，同时猪崽的成活率达到了98％到99％。
    对家禽也进行了实验。吃了抗生素的小鸡在孵出后的头二十天内，比吃普通饲料的小鸡要重10％到15％。青霉素的效果特别好，可以使小鸡多增加重量17％到20％。经过实验的小鸡的死亡率比普通小鸡的死亡率减少三分之一到一半。科学家们还对野兽进行了实验。在雌水貂的食料中掺入生霉素，这种动物的繁殖力就大大增加。它们生出的小兽较大并且不会因疾病死亡。
    苏联“科学与生活”杂志今年8月号刊载了列昂诺夫教授就这一问题所写的论文。他指出，现在科学家正从事寻求一些新的、比药品（如青霉素、链霉素）更便宜的抗生素，以供畜牧方面大量使用。他说，像“茶菌”就可能成为这种刺激素。
