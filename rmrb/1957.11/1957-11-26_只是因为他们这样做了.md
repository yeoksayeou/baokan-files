    Just Because They Did It
    Macheng County, Hubei Province, is a semi-mountainous and semi-plain area with poor soil quality. However, this year's grain and cotton yields have reached the highest targets required by the National Agricultural Development Program.
    What is the reason for such great achievements in a place with such poor natural conditions? It is because of correct leadership methods. This leadership method mainly involves formulating the annual production plan of the agricultural cooperative based on the full discussion of the commune members, and then concentrating on formulating the plan for the entire county. From the county party secretary to the production team leader of the agricultural cooperative, they personally manage experimental plots to guide production with experimental experience. Using the leadership method of "grasping the two ends and leading the middle," field visits and comparisons are organized according to the production season to discover advanced experiences and spread them on the spot; when backward townships, cooperatives, and third-class fields are discovered, forces are immediately organized to provide support, so that the backward can catch up with the advanced. There are also some other measures. The combination of these efforts has resulted in a comprehensive leap in production.
    These practices are not new, but only because the cadres in these places have earnestly done so have they achieved outstanding results. Rural workers in various places may also get some inspiration from these ordinary experiences.

    只是因为他们这样做了
    湖北麻城县是一个半山半川的地区，土质并不好，但今年粮棉产量都达到全国农业发展纲要所要求的最高指标。
    这样一个自然条件并不好的地方能获得这样大的成绩，原因何在？就是因为有正确的领导方法。这种领导方法主要是，在发动社员充分讨论的基础上，制订农业社的全年生产规划，然后再集中起来制订全县的规划。从县委书记起到农业合作社的生产队长，都亲自搞试验田，以试验的经验指导生产。用“抓两头带中间”的领导方法，根据生产季节组织田间参观评比，发现先进的经验，当场传播；发现落后乡、社和三类田，立即组织力量支援，使落后赶上先进。还有其他一些措施。这几方面的努力结合起来，取得了全面的生产大跃进。
    这些作法说来并不新奇，但只是这些地方的干部认真这样作了，他们就得到了突出的成绩。各地农村工作者从这些平平常常的经验里，也可能得到些启示。
