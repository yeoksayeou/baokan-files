    "Artificial Satellite" on the Screen
    This is a Soviet-made documentary.
    The film begins by introducing the preparations before the launch of the artificial satellite. We know that the brilliant Russian scholar Tsiolkovsky predicted as early as the last century that mankind would conquer the mysterious space, and affirmed that the tool for space navigation should be a rocket. Tsiolkovsky's prediction was completely correct. From the film, we see that Soviet scientists launched the first artificial Earth satellite on October 4th. This scientific initiative that opened up mankind's conquest of nature immediately shocked the whole world. Congratulatory telegrams from various countries flew in like snowflakes. People all over the world are talking about this 20th-century miracle. In the film, we see a schematic diagram of the artificial satellite's operation in the air after it was launched; scientific workers are concentrating on observing every moment of this small moon's operation; tens of thousands of Soviet radio enthusiasts are proudly listening to its signals, because this magical artificial satellite is not only flying but also working, it is constantly sending out telegrams, reporting the secrets of the universe.
    Before introducing the launch of the artificial satellite, the film also introduces the experiment of using rockets to carry puppies. When we see the energetic puppies being sent to the skies, we are indeed worried about their extraordinary journey. However, soon they all landed with small parachutes, and their expressions were still so happy and lively. Their body temperature, blood pressure, breathing, and pulse at high altitude have been recorded by sensitive instruments, and even their actions have been filmed by automatic cameras.
    The film also briefly introduces the world's first atomic power plant and the Nuclear Research Institute built in the Soviet Union, as well as the speeches of academicians of the Academy of Sciences and other scenes.

    银幕上的“人造卫星”
    这是苏联赶制出的纪录片。
    影片一开始，先介绍了发射人造卫星前的准备工作。我们知道，俄罗斯天才的学者齐尔科夫斯基早在上个世纪即已预言，人类将会征服那神秘的太空，并且肯定的指出：宇宙航行的工具应当是火箭。齐尔科夫斯基的预言是完全正确的，我们从影片里看到了苏联科学家在10月4日发射出第一个人造地球卫星。这个开辟了人类征服大自然的科学创举，立刻震惊了整个世界。各国的贺电如雪片般飞来。全世界的人们都在谈论这个二十世纪的奇迹。在影片里，我们看到了人造卫星发射以后在空中运行的示意图；科学工作者都在聚精会神地观察着这个小月亮运行的每一瞬间；苏联成千上万的无线电爱好者都在骄傲地收听它的信号，因为这颗神奇的人造卫星不仅在飞行着，而且还在工作着，它不断发出电讯，报告宇宙的秘密。
    影片在介绍人造卫星发射以前，还介绍了用火箭载运小狗的实验。当我们看到生气勃勃的小狗被送上九霄云外的时候，确是为它这次不平凡的旅行担心的。但是，不久它们都带着小降落伞降落了，它们的表情还是那么愉快而活泼。它们在高空时的体温、血压、呼吸和脉搏已被灵敏的仪器纪录下来，甚至连行动也被自动摄影机拍摄成影片。
    影片还简略地介绍了苏联建成的世界上第一个原子能发电站和核子研究所，以及科学院院士们的讲演等场面。
