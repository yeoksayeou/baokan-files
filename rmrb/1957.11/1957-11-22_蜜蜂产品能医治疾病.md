    Honey and other products from bees have very high therapeutic properties. Bee venom, beeswax, royal jelly, etc., can all be used as therapeutic agents. This has been proven by Soviet scientists and doctors through years of experimentation. Recently, a special conference on the application of honey and bee products in medicine was held in Leningrad. More than 400 people, including doctors, veterinarians, pharmacologists, pathologists, and other scientific workers, participated in the conference.
    In the academic reports of the conference, much valuable data was presented regarding the clinical application of bee venom. For example, bee venom can be used to treat diseases of the nervous system and vascular system, as well as some surgical and skin diseases. The reports also proposed two inductive methods for injecting bee venom into the patient's body. The surgical clinic of the National Moscow Second Medical Institute, under the leadership of Professor Saizev, has carried out treatments for several types of cases.
    Bee venom can also be used as a cutting agent. Several preparations have recently been successfully tested. Bee alkane, proposed by Associate Professor Konolenko of Kharkov Medical College, is particularly effective. These preparations have been very effective in treating nervous system diseases, spinal diseases, arthritis, and in obstetrical clinics.
    In his report, Poltev focused on the therapeutic properties of royal jelly. He said that royal jelly contains many valuable things, including Vitamin B. Royal jelly, combined with other therapeutic agents, can play a significant therapeutic role in treating pernicious anemia, boils, and radial bone disease, having a major therapeutic effect on the body. Royal jelly also has a bactericidal effect, enhances metabolism, and increases the body's resistance.
    In addition to describing the therapeutic properties of various bee products, scientists and doctors also pointed out in their academic reports that strict medical examinations must be carried out when using bee venom to treat diseases.

    蜜蜂产品能医治疾病
    蜂蜜和蜜蜂身上的其它产品具有很高的治疗特性。蜜毒、蜜脂、蜜乳等都可以用作治疗剂。这是苏联科学家和医生经过多年来试验证明的。最近在列宁格勒召开了一次关于蜂蜜和蜜蜂产品在医学上应用的专门会议。参加这个会议的有医生、兽医学家、药理学家、病理学家和其他科学工作者共四百多人。
    在会议的学术报告中提出了许多关于蜜毒在临床应用上的有价值的资料。例如，蜜毒可以应用在医治神经系统和血管系统病以及一些外科和皮肤病。报告中还提出了把蜜毒注入病人的有机体的两种诱导法。国立莫斯科第二医学院外科门诊部，在萨依采夫教授的领导下，曾经为好几种病例进行了治疗。
    还可以利用蜜毒作为切断制剂。最近已经试验成功好几种制剂。哈尔科夫医学院科诺林珂副教授提出的蜂烷特别有效。在医治神经系统病、脊椎骨病、关节炎以及在产妇科临床上，这些制剂的效力都很好。
    波尔捷夫在他的报告中，对蜜乳的治疗特性着重作了阐述。他说，在蜜乳里含有许多有价值的东西，其中包括维他命B。蜜乳和其他治疗剂合在一起，在医治恶性贫血病、疖病、桡骨病时，对有机体能起很大的治疗作用。蜜乳还有杀菌的作用，它能增强新陈代谢，增加有机体的抵抗力。
    科学家和医生们在学术报告中除了叙述蜜蜂各种产品的治疗特性外，还指出在利用蜜毒治病时，必须进行严格的医疗检查。
