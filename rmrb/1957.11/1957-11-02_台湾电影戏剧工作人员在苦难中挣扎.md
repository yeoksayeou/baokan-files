Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, October 31st. Taiwan's local drama and film industries are on the verge of collapse under the Jiang Jieshi (Chiang Kai-shek) Group's oppression.

According to Taiwan newspapers, local opera in Taiwan has suffered an unprecedented misfortune since last autumn. During this period, one-third of the local opera troupes have disbanded because they could not sustain themselves. More than sixty theaters have closed down due to the meager audiences and bleak business conditions; more than 90% of the remaining theaters are struggling under very difficult circumstances, and some are already heavily in debt. The lives of Taiwan's film and drama actors and staff are also very difficult.

Taiwan's film and drama industries are struggling under the double shackles of American cultural aggression and the Jiang Jieshi Group's heavy taxes. American films account for 70% of the films shown in Taiwan. Half of the box office revenue of Taiwan theaters is used for various taxes and levies, such as entertainment tax, defense contributions, and troop慰劳 (consolation) funds, etc. The remaining half is the joint income of the theaters and film merchants or troupes. After the theaters have received their due share, they must also pay business tax, income tax, etc., like ordinary shops, so many theaters cannot make ends meet, their equipment is dilapidated, and closures and shutdowns are often heard of. Taiwan's film and drama industries also have to bear some special "obligations." In addition to performing twice a week for the military, each theater also has to set aside dozens of the best seats to entertain the so-called "returning from the front" Chiang army officers and soldiers. Various temporary duty performances are too numerous to mention. Theaters and troupes also have to entertain batches of imposing officials, secret agents, bullies, and ruffians who enter and leave the theater at will.

    台湾电影戏剧工作人员在苦难中挣扎
    新华社广州31日电台湾地方戏剧和电影业在蒋介石集团摧残下濒于绝境。
    据台湾报纸报道，自去年秋季到目前为止，台湾地方戏遭到了空前的厄运。在这段时间内，地方戏的剧团由于无法维持而解散的占了三分之一。戏院由于观众寥寥，营业惨淡，已倒闭了六十多家；其余没有倒闭的戏院，有90％以上都在很困难的情形下苦撑着门面，有些已经是欠债累累了。台湾电影、戏剧演员和工作人员的生活也很困苦。
    台湾的电影、戏剧事业，在美国的文化侵略和蒋介石集团苛重的捐税两条枷锁下苦苦地挣扎着。在台湾放映的电影中，美国影片占70％。台湾戏院的票房收入，有一半要充作各种名目的捐税，诸如娱乐税、防卫捐、劳军款等等，余下的一半才是戏院和影片商人或剧团的共同收入。戏院在分得自己应得的一份之后，还要和一般商店一样再行交纳营业税、所得税等等，因而许多戏院入不敷出，设备残破不堪，倒闭停业日有所闻。台湾的电影、戏剧业还要负担着一些特殊的“义务”，每家戏院除每星期要作两次劳军演出外，平时还要划出几十个最好的座位招待所谓“前方归来的”蒋军官兵，各种临时义务演出更是举不胜举。戏院和剧团还要招待一批批气势汹汹任意出入剧场的官员、特务、恶霸和流氓。
