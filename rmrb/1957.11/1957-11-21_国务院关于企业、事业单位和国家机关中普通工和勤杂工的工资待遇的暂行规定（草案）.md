The current wage treatment for ordinary workers and miscellaneous workers in various departments and regions is generally somewhat too high. Since ordinary workers and miscellaneous workers only engage in simple physical labor and are generally recruited locally, and their relationship with farmers is relatively close, their wage treatment is excessively higher than the income of farmers. This will arouse dissatisfaction among farmers and easily attract a large influx of farmers into cities, which not only hinders agricultural production but also increases difficulties in arranging labor employment and supplying residents' lives in cities. In order to change this situation, it is now determined to set the standard of wage treatment for ordinary workers (referring to formal and temporary ordinary workers in the construction industry and temporary ordinary workers in enterprises, institutions, and state organs) and miscellaneous workers (referring to orderlies, service personnel, and general communicators in enterprises, institutions, and state organs, excluding confidential communicators). The people's committees of each province, autonomous region, and directly administered municipality are responsible for formulating and implementing specific regulations based on the following principles and according to local conditions.

    1.  The wages for newly recruited formal and temporary ordinary workers (levels one to three) in the construction industry should not exceed the income of ordinary farmers in the locality by too much, but should also take into account the difference between urban and rural living standards. Therefore, their wage standards should be equivalent to the income of stronger laborers in general middle-level agricultural cooperatives in the locality, plus the difference in living expenses between urban and rural areas. The specific standards shall be formulated and promulgated by the people's committees of the provinces, autonomous regions, and directly administered municipalities, and shall be uniformly implemented within the province, autonomous region, and directly administered municipality, and shall be reported to the Ministry of Labor for record.

    The current wage standards for formal ordinary workers and temporary ordinary workers whose contracts have not expired before the promulgation of these regulations will not be changed. However, when they are promoted in the future, they should be implemented in accordance with the newly stipulated wage standards in the locality.

    2.  The wage standards for newly recruited miscellaneous workers shall, in principle, not exceed the wage standard of the thirtieth grade of the current state organ staff wage standard table (1). The specific standards shall be formulated and promulgated by the people's committees of the provinces, autonomous regions, and directly administered municipalities, and shall be uniformly implemented within the province, autonomous region, and directly administered municipality, and shall be reported to the Ministry of Labor for record.

    The current wage standards for miscellaneous workers who have been recruited before the promulgation of these regulations will not be changed.

    3.  These regulations shall come into effect from the date of promulgation.

    国务院关于企业、事业单位和国家机关中普通工和勤杂工的工资待遇的暂行规定（草案）
    （一九五七年十一月十六日全国人民代表大会常务委员会第八十五次会议原则批准）
    目前各部门、各地区的普通工和勤杂工的工资待遇，一般都有些偏高。由于普通工和勤杂工只从事简单的体力劳动，并且一般都是就地招收的，同农民的关系比较密切，他们的工资待遇比农民的收入高出过多，就会引起农民的不满，并且容易吸引农民大量流入城市，既有碍于农业生产，也给城市中劳动就业的安排和居民的生活供应等方面增加了困难。为了改变这种状况，现在确定将普通工（指建筑业中正式的和临时的普通工人以及企业、事业单位和国家机关中的临时的普通工人）和勤杂工（指企业、事业单位和国家机关中的勤务员、服务员和一般通讯员，不包括机要通讯员）的工资待遇的标准，责成各省、自治区、直辖市人民委员会根据以下原则，按照各地具体情况，规定执行。
    一、今后新录用的建筑业中正式的和临时的普通工（一级至三级）的工资既不可超过当地一般农民的收入过多，又要照顾城乡生活水平的差别，因此，他们的工资标准，应该以相当于当地一般中等农业社中劳动力较强的农民的收入加上城乡生活费用的差额为原则予以规定；其他企业、事业单位和国家机关今后新录用的临时普通工的工资标准，应该大体相当于或者略低于当地建筑业普通工的工资标准。具体标准都由省、自治区、直辖市人民委员会规定颁发，在本省、自治区、直辖市范围内统一执行，并且报送劳动部备案。
    在本规定发布以前已经录用的正式普通工和合同期未满的临时普通工的现行工资标准，都不予变动。但是，他们在今后升级的时候，都应该按照当地新规定的工资标准执行。
    二、今后新录用的勤杂工的工资标准，应该以最高不超过现行国家机关工作人员工资标准表（一）第三十级的工资标准为原则，由省、自治区、直辖市人民委员会具体规定颁发，在本省、自治区、直辖市范围内统一执行，并且报送劳动部备案。
    在本规定发布以前已经录用的勤杂工的现行工资标准，不予变动。
    三、本规定自公布之日起施行。
