Dear Comrades! Today, the people of Albania, a small country, celebrate the most significant festival in the history of human society – the 40th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution – with immense joy. On this day, we, on behalf of the Albanian people, the Labor Party, and the People's Republic of Albania, extend our warmest greetings to the fraternal Soviet people and the beloved Communist Party of the Soviet Union, founded by the great Lenin. (Applause)

In world history, the October Socialist Revolution is the greatest and most important event concerning human destiny. Under the leadership of the Bolshevik Party headed by the great Lenin, you overthrew the regime of capitalists and landlords and established the Soviet power, the dictatorship of the proletariat (the highest form of democracy for the broad masses of the people), for the first time on one-sixth of the world's land, opening a new era for all mankind – the era of the demise of capitalism and the victory of socialism.

Albania, a small country located on the Adriatic coast, was once an oppressed and backward nation. However, as a weak nation, it was ruthlessly oppressed and exploited by aggressors of the old era and modern imperialists.

The Great October Socialist Revolution triumphed in Russia. It eradicated exploitation and poverty, realizing mankind's dream of a new and happy life for thousands of years.

The echoes of the Great October Socialist Revolution, like a violent storm, flew across national borders and the bayonets of imperialist armies. It reverberated in our mountains as well. It awakened our people, further strengthened their centuries-long hatred of the enslavers, united the workers and peasants of Albania, encouraged them, and ignited in their hearts the hope of liberating our country from the heavy oppression of foreign occupiers and local ruling classes.

Although Albania declared its independence forty-five years ago, it remained a country dependent on foreign capitalist powers. However, the hearts of the Albanian people were like a real volcano, and they longed to realize in their own country what the various ethnic groups of Russia had already achieved.

On April 7, 1939, Italian fascists, regardless of the resistance of our people, occupied Albania. The ruling class betrayed our people. Fascism extended its evil claws to the whole of Europe. The fascists, with all their armed forces, attacked the Soviet Union – the unshakeable fortress of the people of all countries fighting for freedom. In those days, the communists of our country and the poorest classes of our residents showed a much greater will and desire than ever before. They were united in their determination to fight for the liberation of their motherland, linking their fate with the struggle of the peoples of the Soviet Union. In the critical days of November 1941, the Albanian Communist Party was founded. It followed the example of the beloved Communist Party of the Soviet Union and, using its experience, pointed out to our people the road to victory, and established a brotherly friendship with the Soviet people as comrades-in-arms. Victory was bought with the price of blood, and our two peoples consolidated their friendship with blood. Because of this friendship, because of their own struggle and the heroic and miraculous struggle of the Soviet people, the Albanian people achieved freedom, established a people's government, and will never again be the lamb to be slaughtered by any foreign imperialist power. Therefore, the Albanian people will protect this friendship as they protect their own eyes. It is the most precious thing, the greatest victory, and the guarantee of the independence and progress of our motherland. (Applause)

It has only been thirteen years since the victory of our people's revolution on November 29, 1944. But, what a profound change has taken place in the face of our motherland during this period! Albania used to be the most backward country in Europe. The few small factories we had in the past could be counted on the fingers of one hand. In the fields of our country, where slavery had sown seeds of blood, tears, and poverty for centuries, peasants tilled the land with wooden plows. The majority of residents in our cities and villages were ignorant and did not know what a school was.

The brutal enemy murdered tens of thousands of our brothers and sisters, destroyed and burned a large number of villages, ruined factories, roads and cities, and stole the food we needed to survive. But, at this moment, Soviet ships sailed into our port city of Durrës. They carried not gunpowder, cannons, and soldiers to invade our country, they carried not slavery and poverty like the imperialist warships brought. These were ships of friendship and peace. They brought us grain, comrades, and your finely crafted factory equipment. (Prolonged applause)

The Albanian people set about restoring their country and building a new Albania. We had many great difficulties. We overcame these difficulties because you were standing with us, comrades, you taught us how to work. Soviet workers, technicians, and engineers worked day and night side by side with our workers to build factories, combined factories, and power stations in our country.

Our people and our Party struck the mountains with iron fists and steel wrists, and we extracted chromium, oil, copper, and asphalt from the mountains. We drained the swamps, built new roads, laid railways, cultivated lemons and oranges, and opened institutions of higher learning, opera houses, theaters, and universities. The working class of our country and the entire Albanian people will never forget the Soviet Union's enormous and generous assistance! (Applause)

The Soviet Union, your glorious motherland – the product of the October Revolution, is the greatest world power, a powerful socialist country, a country with a strong industry, highly developed agriculture, advanced technology and culture. The Soviet Union has opened the way to a world hitherto undiscovered with brilliant scientific inventions. The first and second man-made earth satellites you have launched are orbiting the earth. You have opened the way for mankind to go into space. Karl Marx once called the assault of the members of the Paris Commune a "storming of heaven." This wonderful and vivid metaphor, thanks to the genius of Marx and Lenin's thought, has become a reality today. These ideas have been truly realized in the glorious Soviet homeland. You have created intercontinental ballistic missiles. You have greatly shortened the distance between countries around the world. Due to the brilliant achievements of the Soviet people's creative genius, the homeland of the October Revolution has become an indestructible fortress of socialism and peace, which has won the love and praise of millions of workers fighting for liberation from capitalist and colonial oppression. It has become the country that people see as their future. It is a great happiness for the socialist system to have the Soviet Union as such a great, faithful, and noble friend. The Soviet Union, with its huge economic, political, and military strength, shares everything with us so that we can all move forward together and build socialism and communism. (Applause)

The strength of the Soviet Union is the main guarantee that we can all jointly defend our revolutionary achievements. Our revolution is a continuation of the great October Socialist Revolution. The 20th Congress of the CPSU was of great significance not only for the Soviet Union but also for the entire international communist and workers' movement. The countries of the socialist camp, headed by the Soviet Union, have now become a reliable pillar in the struggle to defend world peace, and a reliable pillar in the struggle of colonial countries to win liberation, and in the struggle of countries that have won freedom and are striving to develop their economies. It is no accident that all imperialist forces, revisionists, and their accomplices attempt to undermine the unity of the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union. But they have failed, and they will always suffer a shameful defeat.

The Albanian Labor Party will, as always, safeguard and strengthen the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and consolidate proletarian internationalism. (Applause) As always, our eyes will be on the Soviet Union, on the Communist Party created by Lenin. As always, we will continue to learn from you, because the ideas of the October Revolution that you have realized are the lighthouse illuminating the road for the whole world.

We regard the Soviet Union as our savior and liberator. (Applause) Because of the Soviet Union, we have achieved freedom, we are building socialism, and we are living a happy life. Thanks to the Soviet Union's brotherly and selfless internationalist assistance, we have become invincible, and we have a deep and unwavering confidence in our strength. We have forged an eternal friendship of steel with the Soviet Union and the countries of the socialist camp. We draw new strength from this great friendship to fight, to strive for the future, and to continue to achieve socialist victories. Our people express their deep feelings in singing about this friendship:

Yes, brothers, the Albanians know very well:
Without the Soviet homeland, there would be no Albania.
Batch after batch of factories and combined factories, every workshop
Was built by us and our Soviet brothers together!
This friendship is our strength, we will protect it as we protect the most precious thing, and we will never allow anyone to undermine it.

Our enemies – the imperialists – are plotting plunder plans, intending to endanger the world with new bloody threats, turn the world into a new slaughterhouse, and hinder mankind's historical development on the road to communism. But they will not achieve this goal, they will never achieve this goal! Their attempt to hinder the future of mankind is futile. The invincible socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union stands before them like a giant rock, and the workers and peoples of the world stand before them. The cause of the Great October Socialist Revolution will be victorious in every battle! The world is moving forward with confidence on the path opened up by the October Revolution, on the path of peace, friendship, and socialism. (Applause)

Comrades! On this significant day, when we are celebrating the 40th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution in the great family of socialist countries and in the ranks of millions of workers (our friends all over the world), the mood of the Albanian people is closer to your glorious homeland than ever before, and we sincerely hope that you will achieve new and greater successes in the sacred struggle for the victory of communism and peace. (Applause)

In the Second World War, people from Moscow, Leningrad, Stalingrad, and Odessa, as well as hundreds of thousands of people from all over the Soviet Union, sacrificed their lives to defend their vast territory and to defend our small country. It is impossible to describe the hardships you have endured to save your second generation and the second generation of Albania, and you have shed a great deal of blood for the happiness of your own people and the people of all countries in the world. Many of your sons and daughters gave their lives to bring freedom to Europe and peace to mankind. Until now, you have continued to uphold this noble spirit of internationalism, sharing your happiness with the people of many countries in the world. You are helping backward and advanced countries, you are helping the people of countries large and small, from great China to small Albania.

Comrades! On this important festival, the working class, working peasants, people's intellectuals, and the entire people of Albania sincerely thank you for the blood and sweat you have shed to save, consolidate, and prosper our socialist motherland. (Applause)

Thank you, dear comrades and brothers, for everything you have done for our people and for our motherland. We will always be grateful to you! (Applause)

Long live the 40th anniversary of the Great October

    阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国代表团团长
    霍查同志的讲话
    亲爱的同志们！今天，小国阿尔巴尼亚的人民怀着巨大的喜悦的心情，同光荣的苏联人民一道来庆祝人类社会历史上最重大的节日——伟大的十月社会主义革命四十周年。在这一天，我们代表阿尔巴尼亚人民、劳动党和阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国，向兄弟般的苏联人民和由伟大列宁所缔造的亲爱的苏联共产党致以最热烈的敬礼。（掌声）
    在世界史上，十月社会主义革命是关系人类命运的最伟大最重要的事件。在以伟大列宁为首的布尔什维克党领导下，你们推翻了资本家和地主的政权，在世界六分之一的土地上第一次建立了苏维埃政权、无产阶级专政（广大人民群众民主的最高形式），开辟了全人类的新纪元——资本主义灭亡和社会主义胜利的纪元。
    位于亚得里亚海滨的小国阿尔巴尼亚，曾是一个被压迫的落后国家。但是，作为一个弱小的民族，旧时代的侵略者和现代的帝国主义者都无情地压迫和剥削过他们。
    伟大的十月社会主义革命，在俄国胜利了。它铲除了剥削和贫困，实现了人类千百年来渴望新的幸福的生活的梦想。
    伟大的十月社会主义革命的回声像阵疾风暴雨飞过了各国国界和帝国主义军队的刺刀。在我国的山中也起了反响。它唤醒了我国人民，更加加强了他们几世纪以来对奴役者的仇恨，使阿尔巴尼亚的工人和农民团结起来，鼓舞了他们，在他们的心中燃起了对我国从外国占领者和当地统治阶级的惨重压迫下取得解放的希望。
    尽管阿尔巴尼亚在四十五年前宣布过自己的独立，但仍然是一个依附于外国资本主义列强的国家。但是，阿尔巴尼亚人民的心是真正的火山，他们渴望在自己国家里实现俄国各族人民所已经实现的东西。
    1939年4月7日，意大利法西斯分子不顾我国人民的反抗，占领了阿尔巴尼亚。统治阶级出卖了我国人民。法西斯把自己的魔爪伸向整个欧洲。法西斯分子以其全部的武装力量向苏联——各国人民为争取自由而斗争的不可动摇的堡垒——进攻。在那些日子里，我国的共产党人和我国居民的极贫苦的阶层，比任何时候都表现了更大得多的意志和意愿，万众一心更加坚决地为争取祖国的解放而斗争，把自己的命运同苏联各族人民的斗争联系在一起。在1941年11月的危急的日子里，阿尔巴尼亚共产党成立了。它追随着亲爱的苏联共产党的榜样，并且利用它的经验，向我国人民指出了走向胜利的道路，和苏联人民结成战友的兄弟情谊。胜利是用鲜血的代价换来的，我们两国人民以鲜血巩固了友谊。由于这种友谊，由于自己的斗争以及苏联人民的英勇神奇的斗争，阿尔巴尼亚人民取得了自由，建立了人民政权，并且永远也不再是任何外国帝国主义列强宰割的羔羊。因此，阿尔巴尼亚人民将像保护眼珠似地保护这种友谊，它是最珍贵的东西，是最大的胜利，是我们祖国独立和进步的保障。（掌声）
    自从1944年11月29日我国人民革命胜利以来统共只有十三年。但是，在这段时期里我们祖国的面貌起了多末深刻的变化啊！阿尔巴尼亚过去是欧洲最落后的国家。我国过去仅有的小工厂简直屈指可数。在几世纪以来奴役制曾经撒下血泪和贫困的种子的我国田野上，农民用木犁耕地。我国城乡的大多数居民愚昧无知，不知道学校为何物。
    残暴的敌人杀害了我们成千上万的兄弟姊妹，破坏和烧毁了大批的乡村，毁坏了工厂、道路和城市，抢走了我们活命的粮食。但是，正当这个关头，苏联的轮船驶进了我们的港口城市都拉斯。它们载来的不是为侵占我国用的火药、大炮和士兵，它们载来的不是像帝国主义军舰所带来的奴役和贫困。这是友好和和平之船。它们给我们载来了粮食，同志们，还有你们精工细制的工厂设备。（经久不息的掌声）
    阿尔巴尼亚人民着手恢复自己的国家，建设新的阿尔巴尼亚。我们有很多巨大的困难。我们克服了这些困难，因为有你们和我们站在一起，同志们，是你们教导我们应该怎样工作。苏联的工人、技术员和工程师同我国的工人并肩携手日日夜夜地为在我国建立工厂、联合工厂、电站而辛勤地工作。
    我国人民和我们的党以铁拳钢腕捶击群山，我们从山里取到了铬、石油、铜、沥青。我们汲干了沼泽，建设了新的道路，敷设了铁道，培植了柠檬和橘子，开办了高等学校、歌剧院、戏院和大学。我国工人阶级和阿尔巴尼亚全体人民终生也不会忘记苏联的巨大的慷慨援助！（掌声）
    苏联，你们的光荣的祖国——十月革命的产儿，是最大的世界强国，是强大的社会主义国家，是一个有强大的工业、高度发展的农业、先进技术和文化的国家。苏联以光辉的科学发明开辟了通往直到现在尚未发现的世界的道路。你们放出来的第一颗和第二颗人造地球卫星正在围绕地球运转。你们开辟了人类到宇宙去的道路。卡尔·马克思曾经把巴黎公社社员们的冲击称做“冲天之举”，这句绝妙的生动比喻的话，由于马克思和列宁的天才思想，在今天变成了现实。这些思想在光荣的苏维埃的祖国已经如实地实现了。你们创制了洲际弹道火箭。你们大大地缩短了世界各国之间的距离。由于苏联人民创造天才的光辉成就，十月革命的祖国已经成了坚不可摧的社会主义和和平的堡垒，它已博得了为从资本主义和殖民压迫下解放而斗争的千百万工人的热爱和赞扬。它已经成了人们把它看作是自己的未来的国家。社会主义体系各国能有苏联这样一个伟大、忠实和崇高的朋友，是极大的幸福。拥有巨大的经济、政治和军事实力的苏联和我们分享着一切，以便使我们大家能一道前进，建成社会主义和共产主义。（掌声）
    苏联的强大，是我们大家能以共同保卫我们革命成果的主要保证。我们的革命是伟大的十月社会主义革命的继续。苏共第二十次代表大会不仅对于苏联，而且对于整个国际共产主义工人运动都有重大的意义。以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国，现在成了保卫世界和平斗争的可靠支柱，成了殖民地国家为争取解放而斗争，以及已取得自由并极力发展自己经济的各国斗争的可靠支柱。所有帝国主义势力、修正主义者和它们的帮凶，妄图破坏以苏联为首的社会主义各国的团结，决非偶然。但是他们失败了，他们永远会遭到可耻的失败。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党将和往常一样维护和巩固以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结，巩固无产阶级的国际主义。（掌声）和往常一样，我们的眼睛将朝着苏联，朝着列宁缔造的共产党。和往常一样，我们还将向你们学习，因为你们所实现的十月革命的思想，是为全世界照亮道路的灯塔。
    我们把苏联看作是自己的拯救者和解放者。（掌声）由于有苏联，我们才取得了自由，我们正在建设社会主义，过着幸福生活。由于苏联的兄弟般的无私的国际主义援助，我们成了不可战胜者，我们对于我们的力量有深刻的、毫不动摇的信心。我们同苏联，同社会主义阵营各国结成钢铁般的永恒友谊。我们从这伟大的友谊中汲取进行斗争、争取未来以及继续取得社会主义胜利所需的新的力量。我国人民在歌唱这种友谊中表达了自己深厚的感情：
    是的，兄弟们，阿尔巴尼亚人知道得很清楚：
    没有苏维埃的祖国，就没有阿尔巴尼亚。
    一批一批的工厂和联合工厂，每一个工场
    都是我们和苏联弟兄们一道建成的！
    这友谊就是我们的力量，我们将像保护最珍贵的东西一样来保卫它，我们决不允许任何人来破坏它。
    我们的敌人——帝国主义者正在策动掠夺的计划，打算用新的血腥的威胁危及世界，把世界变成新的屠杀场，阻挠人类在通往共产主义道路上的历史发展。但是，他们达不到这个目的，他们决不会达到这个目的！他们想阻碍人类的未来是枉然的。以苏联为首的不可战胜的社会主义阵营，像一块巨岩似地耸立在他们的面前，站在他们面前的还有全世界的工人和各国人民。伟大的十月社会主义革命的事业百战百胜！世界满怀信心地在十月革命开辟的道路上，在和平、友好和社会主义的道路上前进。（掌声）
    同志们！在这重大的日子里，当我们在社会主义国家的大家庭里，在千百万工人（我们在世界各地的朋友）的队伍里庆祝伟大的十月社会主义革命四十周年的时候，阿尔巴尼亚人民的心情是要比任何时候更加靠近你们光荣的祖国，并且衷心地希望你们在争取共产主义和和平的胜利而进行的神圣斗争中取得新的、更大的成就。（掌声）
    在第二次世界大战中，来自莫斯科、列宁格勒、斯大林格勒和敖德萨的人们，以及来自苏联各地的千百万人，为了保卫自己的广大国土和保卫我们的小国而献出了生命。你们为了拯救自己的第二代和阿尔巴尼亚的第二代所遭受的艰难困苦是罄竹难书的，你们为了本国人民和全世界各国人民的幸福而流了大量的血。贵国许多儿女以生命为代价给欧洲带来了自由，为人类带来了和平。直到现在你们仍然继续坚持这种崇高的国际主义精神，同世界上许多国家的人民分享着你们的幸福。你们在帮助落后的和先进的国家，你们在帮助从伟大的中国直到小小的阿尔巴尼亚为止的大大小小国家的人民。
    同志们！在这重大的节日里，阿尔巴尼亚的工人阶级、劳动农民、人民的知识分子，以及阿尔巴尼亚的全体人民，都衷心地向你们致谢，感谢你们为了拯救、巩固和繁荣我们社会主义祖国所流的血汗。（掌声）
    谢谢你们，亲爱的同志们和兄弟们，感谢你们为我国人民、为我们祖国所做的一切。我们将永远感激你们！（掌声）
    伟大的十月社会主义革命四十周年万岁！（掌声）
    阿尔巴尼亚人民和伟大苏联人民之间的永恒的牢不可破的友谊万岁！（掌声）
    以苏联为首的强大的社会主义阵营万岁！（掌声）
    光荣属于亲爱的苏联共产党和伟大的列宁！（掌声）
    光荣属于马克思列宁主义！（经久不息的掌声）
