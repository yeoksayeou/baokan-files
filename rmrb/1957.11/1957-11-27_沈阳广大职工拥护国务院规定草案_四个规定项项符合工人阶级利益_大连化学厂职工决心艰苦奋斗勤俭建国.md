(From Our Newspaper) The broad masses of workers in Shenyang City, after reading the four draft provisional regulations of the State Council on improving certain labor wages and labor insurance benefits, praised these four regulations as reasonable stipulations that conform to the long-term interests of the working class.

The entire workforce of the Huanggu Tun Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory discussed these four drafts. The Shenyang Paper Mill, Freight Car Repair Factory, Municipal Electrical Appliance Factory, and other units have invited some veteran workers and apprentices for discussions. The workers all agree with these four new regulations. Chen Shuchang, an apprentice at the Water Pump Factory who joined last May, said: "Our apprentices' wages are 28 yuan per month, which is 336 yuan per year. In addition, we enjoy labor insurance benefits and receive free medical treatment. I have only been away from my hometown for a short time, and my actual income exceeds the income of a first-class laborer in our hometown's agricultural production cooperative. This is very unreasonable. If it is not corrected quickly, the peasants will have opinions about us, which will affect the relationship between workers and peasants." Jin Shumei, an apprentice at the Water Pump Factory, said: "The apprenticeship period should be extended, and the income should be lower. Now, some apprentices haven't learned the technology well but have learned how to spend money first."

When many veteran workers in factories talked about extending the apprenticeship period and implementing a living allowance system, they praised the State Council's regulations. Wang Huifu and Kang Zhaocheng, veteran workers at the Huanggu Tun Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory, both believed that the State Council's new regulations were very correct. They said: "In the past, many apprentices finished their apprenticeship after only six months. They didn't learn the technology well, and their arrogant attitude of looking down on their masters grew, which was not good for improving the apprentices' technical level and ideological awareness.

Liu Enzhou, a gray-haired 61-year-old worker at the Paper Mill, was extremely happy after seeing the draft provisional regulations on the retirement of workers and staff. He said: The Party and the government take such good care of retired veteran workers, not only giving them old-age subsidies but also providing medical treatment. This was something we didn't even dare to think about in the old society. Wang Bingling, who has been a boiler worker for more than 30 years, went home to educate his son and daughter, who are apprentices, to correctly understand these four drafts. He also stated that before retiring, he must teach all his skills to the young workers without holding anything back. Luo Zhihui, a mail carrier at the Shenyang Post Office, got married not long ago, and his wife is a rural woman. After seeing the draft provisional regulations of the State Council on the holidays and wage benefits for workers and staff returning home to visit relatives, he decided to mobilize his wife to return to the countryside to participate in agricultural production.

(From Our Newspaper) The four draft regulations of the State Council, such as the provisional regulations on the retirement of workers and staff, have been warmly supported by the broad masses of workers and staff at the Dalian Chemical Plant. Workers in many workshops have organized reading sessions and discussions. Some workers have put up big-character posters expressing their support for these government regulations.

Liu Rende, a veteran compressor worker in the Heavy Alkali Workshop in his fifties, said: "Our new society is so concerned about the workers that the workers can be taken care of by the state from old age until death." He calculated the accounts and said: "I earn more than 60 yuan a month now. After retirement, I should get 50%, which is more than 30 yuan a month. Not only can I use it for my own living expenses, but it is also enough for my wife and I to eat and dress!" Young workers such as Yang Jingyu from the Carbonization Section all believe that the state's regulations on the apprenticeship system are reasonable. They cited facts to show that if apprentices graduate too quickly, they not only fail to learn the technology well but also cause frequent production accidents due to their lack of technical proficiency, causing losses to the country, which is very detrimental to the development of production. Veteran worker Liu Zixiang said: "In the past, when young workers arrived at the factory, the factory had to take care of everything. They would graduate and be promoted after only a few months of learning, which was too unreasonable. Now the government's regulations are right!" Wang Xianlin, a worker, applied to the factory for housing some time ago to bring his wife over. After seeing the draft regulations on the vacation and wage issues for workers' visiting relatives, he happily said, "What's the point of having a house when you can have two weeks of vacation a year to go home to visit relatives!" An employee of the Transportation Section of this factory said: "I have five houses in my hometown that are unoccupied, but I brought my wife and children to the city to live, which makes my life tired and adds to the burden on the country. In the past, I wanted to send my wife home, but now that the state gives vacation for visiting relatives, I will definitely mobilize my wife to go home and give my house to the people who need it most."

Through discussion, the workers have come to understand the principle that everything should be based on the population of 600 million and believe that workers should further establish the idea of hard work. They have taken the initiative to propose abolishing some excessive and unreasonable welfare benefits and rewards in the factory. Wang Jitang, a worker in the Caustic Soda Workshop, criticized the unreasonable reward system implemented in the workshop. He said: "If our workshop fails to complete the quota, we are paid on a time basis. If we exceed the quota, we are paid on a piecework basis. This is too unreasonable and should be corrected." Everyone also criticized the excessive demands for wages and benefits made by some people among the workers.

    沈阳广大职工拥护国务院规定草案
    四个规定项项符合工人阶级利益
    大连化学厂职工决心艰苦奋斗勤俭建国
    本报讯　沈阳市广大职工阅读了国务院关于改进某些劳动工资和劳保福利的四项暂行规定草案以后，都称赞这四项规定是符合工人阶级长远利益的合理规定。
    皇姑屯机车客车修理工厂全厂职工都讨论了这四个草案。沈阳造纸厂、货车修理工厂、市电器制造厂等单位已经邀请部分老工人、学徒工进行了座谈。职工们都同意这四项新规定。去年5月入厂的水泵厂徒工陈树昌说：“我们徒工的工资每月二十八元，一年便是三百三十六元，另外还享受劳动保险待遇，治病不花钱。我离开家乡时间很短，我的实际收入便超过了我们家乡农业生产合作社一等劳动力的收入，这是很不合理的。如果再不赶快纠正，农民会对我们有意见，也会影响工人、农民之间的感情。”水泵厂徒工金淑梅说：“徒工的学徒时间应该延长，收入也应该少一些。现在有些徒工技术没学好，就先学会花钱了。”
    许多工厂的老工人在谈到延长学徒时间、实行生活补贴制度的问题时，都称赞国务院的规定。皇姑屯机车客车修理工厂老工人王惠孚、康兆成都认为国务院这个新规定非常正确。他们说：“过去不少徒工学了六个月就满徒了，技术没有学好，看不起师傅的骄傲情绪却滋长起来，这对提高徒工的技术水平和思想觉悟是没有好处的。
    造纸厂白发苍苍的六十一岁老工人刘恩洲看到工人、职员退休暂行规定草案以后，异常高兴。他说：党和政府对退休老工人照顾得真周到，不但发给养老补助费，还给治病，这个事情在旧社会连想都不敢想。当了三十多年锅炉工的王秉岭回家教育正在当学徒的儿子、女儿正确认识这四个草案。他自己还表示，在退休以前，一定要把全部技术一点不拉地教给青年工人。沈阳邮局投递员罗志辉结婚不久，他妻子是农村妇女。他看到国务院关于工人、职员回家探亲的假期和工资待遇的暂行规定草案以后，决定动员他的妻子回乡参加农业生产。
    本报讯　国务院关于工人、职员退休处理的暂行规定等四个草案，受到大连化学厂广大职工的热烈拥护。许多车间的工人组织了读报、座谈；有的职工张贴大字报，对政府这些规定表示拥护。
    重碱车间五十多岁的老压缩机工人刘仁德说：我们的新社会对工人太关心了，工人从老到死都能得到国家的照顾。他算了一下账说：我现在一个月挣六十多元钱，退休后得50％吧，一个月还有三十多元，不但自己的生活用不了，我们老两口也够吃够穿了！炭化工段的青年工人杨景玉等都认为，国家对学徒制度所作的规定是合情合理的。他们列举事实说明：徒工出徒快了，不但自己学不到技术，而且由于技术不熟练，经常发生生产事故，给国家造成损失，这对发展生产很不利。老工人刘子祥说：“过去青年工人一到工厂，什么都要工厂包下来，学几个月就出徒升级，这太不合理。现在政府的这项规定就对了！”工人王贤林前些时候还向工厂申请住房，要把妻子接来，这次看到国家对职工探亲假期和工资问题的规定草案以后，高兴地说：“一年能有两个星期的假回家探亲，还要房子作什么！”这个厂运输科的一位职员说：我老家有五间房子没人住，却把老婆孩子弄到城市住，自己生活受累，还给国家增加负担。过去我就想把老婆送回家，现在国家给探亲的假期，我一定把我老婆动员回家，把我住的房子交给最急需房子的人住。
    经过讨论，工人们懂得了办一切事情都应该从六亿人口出发的道理，认为工人应该进一步树立艰苦奋斗的思想。他们主动提议取消工厂里一些过高的和不合理的福利待遇和奖励等制度。烧碱车间工人王继堂批评了车间实行的不合理的奖励制度。他说：我们车间完不成定额就给计时工资，超过定额就给计件奖，这太不合理，应该纠正。对职工中某些人对工资福利提出的过高要求，大家也作了批判。
