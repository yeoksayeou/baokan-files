Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, November 9th. Indian Red Cross Society President Mrs. Kaur issued a statement strongly refuting the insulting accusations made against her by Mr. McClintock, the head of the U.S. government delegation attending the International Red Cross Conference.

After Mrs. Kaur resigned from her position as chairperson of the conference and led the Indian Red Cross delegation in withdrawing from the meeting in protest against the U.S.'s disruptive actions, McClintock slandered her legitimate actions as "blackmail."

In her statement, which was published in all major newspapers today, Mrs. Kaur expressed regret that a person attending a Red Cross conference "devoted to the noble cause of peace and helping suffering humanity" would "use such language."

She believes that if the U.S. government had had the "courtesy and wisdom" to raise objections when sending out invitations twenty months ago, and if the Standing Committee had changed its previous decision (regarding the designation of the Chiang Kai-shek clique), then the host country's Red Cross Society would have had ample time to withdraw its invitations, because the Indian Red Cross Society would never have wanted to issue invitations using the name of two Chinas.

She said that therefore, given the U.S. delegation's stubborn attitude, the Indian Red Cross Society "had no choice but to withdraw from the meeting to protest this discourteous action." She said that McClintock's insulting language "was completely inappropriate and completely lacking in dignity, and certainly not in keeping with the spirit of the Red Cross."

### 印红十字会主席考尔发表声明  强硬驳斥美国代表的诬蔑

    印红十字会主席考尔发表声明
    强硬驳斥美国代表的诬蔑
    新华社新德里9日电　印度红十字会主席考尔女士发表声明，强硬驳斥出席国际红十字大会的美国政府代表团团长麦克林托克对她提出的侮辱性的指责。
    在考尔女士为抗议美国的破坏行动而辞去大会主席职务并率领印度红十字会代表团退出会议后，麦克林托克曾诬蔑她的正当行动是“讹诈”。
    考尔女士在今天各主要报纸都登载的她的声明中，对于前来出席“从事和平和帮助受苦人类的崇高事业的”红十字大会的一个人竟然“使用这种措词”表示遗憾。
    她认为，如果美国政府有在二十个月前发请帖的时候就提出抗议的“礼貌和聪明”，如果常设委员会已经改变了它先前的决定（关于对蒋介石集团的称呼的决定），那么东道国的红十字会本来可以有充裕的时间来撤回它的请帖，因为印度红十字会任何时候都不愿用两个中国的名称发出请帖。
    她说，因此，鉴于美国代表团的固执态度，印度红十字会“除了退出会议来抗议这种不礼貌的行动外没有别的办法”。她说，麦克林托克所用的侮辱性言词“是完全不得当和完全没有气度的，并且肯定是不符合红十字会的精神的”。
