Xinhua News Agency, New York, 24th: The US economy is currently in a recession. Many in the US economic circles believe that this recession will be more serious than the two US post-war economic recessions in 1949 and 1953-54.

    The United States is currently experiencing serious overproduction of basic means of production and daily consumer goods. In recent years, American monopoly capital has artificially maintained economic "prosperity" by massively increasing basic investment to expand production capacity. This investment increased from $27 billion in 1954 to an annual rate of $37 billion in the second quarter of 1957. This has led to a serious "excess" of production capacity. At present, the operating production capacity of the entire manufacturing industry is only 82%, and the operating rate of the steel industry is only about 77% (as of mid-November).

    Commodity inventories have also increased to very high levels. As of August this year, the total US inventory reached $91.2 billion, an increase of 4.6% over a year earlier.

    Under the pressure of overproduction, many factories have reduced production. By October this year, the level of industrial production had fallen to its lowest point in fifteen months (the production index was 142). Overall, this year (except for a slight rebound in production in July and August) the production index is a sluggish downward curve.

    In the past two or three months, the phenomenon of economic recession has spread from the production sector to the areas of circulation and consumption. The volume of vehicle transportation has decreased by 11% in the past month compared to a year ago. In early November, the volume of transportation of several important industrial products decreased significantly: coal decreased by 9.2% compared to the same period last year, coking coal decreased by 18.5%, timber decreased by 16%, and iron ore decreased by 21.6%.

    The number of employees in factories continued to decline from the September level in October, with the aircraft industry alone reducing 40,000 people. The factory employment level in September had already decreased by 186,000 people compared to a year earlier.

    The number of unemployed is rising. In the first three weeks of October, the number of people applying for unemployment benefits increased by 46% compared to a year earlier.

    Due to factory layoffs, reductions in working hours, and other factors, the national personal income in the United States fell by $1 billion in October. And September this year was $200 million lower than August.

    Due to declining wages and continued increases in living costs, the purchasing power of manufacturing, construction, mining, and agricultural workers in October decreased by 3.3% compared to December last year. The decline in purchasing power has already affected the shrinkage of trade volume. The retail trade volume in September fell for the second consecutive month. The department store trade volume in October fell to its lowest level since February 1956.

    American newspapers generally believe that American production will continue to decline in the future, and the economic recession is only in its early stages. American newspapers have listed several signs that serve as the basis for this prediction. One is that fixed investment, which previously supported the temporary "prosperity" of the economy, is decreasing. The "American Institute" estimates, based on a study of the business activities of 1,000 companies, that fixed investment may shrink by $7 billion next year. Another is that orders for machine tools are declining. In September this year, orders for machine tools decreased by 35% compared to August, and decreased by 63% compared to the level a year ago. Currently, orders for steel have also decreased by 21%. In addition, there are signs of contraction in US foreign trade. From March to August this year, the total value of US exports has been declining, and after a slight increase in September, it declined again in October.

    The stock exchange, which to a certain extent is the economic weather vane of the United States, is in a long-term slump. From mid-July to October this year, stock prices on the New York Stock Exchange fell by more than 15%, and the total value of listed stocks decreased by more than $25 billion. Although stock prices rebounded somewhat recently due to the stimulus of Eisenhower's two consecutive speeches clamoring for stepped-up war preparations, they have resumed their downward trend in the past few days.

    Currently, the measures taken by the US government to cope with the economic recession are: increasing military spending and loosening monetary policy to "stimulate" economic activity.

### 生产过剩　存货激增　贸易萎缩  美国经济活动继续衰退  华盛顿当局借助增加军费和放松银根等措施来救急

    生产过剩　存货激增　贸易萎缩
    美国经济活动继续衰退
    华盛顿当局借助增加军费和放松银根等措施来救急
    新华社24日讯　纽约消息：美国经济目前正处在衰退过程中。美国不少经济界人士认为，这次衰退将比美国战后在1949年和1953—54年两次经济衰退都更为严重。
    美国的基本生产资料以及日常消费用品目前都出现了严重的生产过剩。几年来，美国垄断资本用大量增加扩大生产能力方面的基本投资，来人为地维持经济“繁荣”。这种投资从1954年的二百七十亿美元增加到1957年第二季的年率三百七十亿美元。这使得生产能力严重地“过剩”了。目前整个制造业开动的生产能力只及82％，钢铁工业的开工率只有77％左右（到11月中旬）。
    商品储存量也已经增到很高的水平。到今年8月为止，美国全部存货量达到九百一十二亿美元，比一年以前增加了4．6％。
    在生产过剩的压力下，许多工厂的生产减少了。到今年10月，工业生产水平下降到十五个月来的最低点（生产指数为一四二）。整个说来，今年（中间除了7、8月的生产稍有回升以外）生产指数是一条迟滞的下降的曲线。
    近两、三个月来，经济衰退的现象已经从生产领域蔓延到流通、消费等领域。车辆的运载量在过去一个月里，比一年前减少了11％。在11月初，几种重要的工业产品的运载量都有显著减少：煤比去年同期减少了9．2％，焦煤减少了18．5％，木材减少了16％，铁矿砂减少了21．6％。
    10月份工厂中的就业人数继续从9月份的水平下降，飞机工业一个部门就减少了四万人。9月份工厂就业水平已经比一年前减少了十八万六千人。
    失业人数在上升，10月份头三个星期，要求领失业津贴的人数比一年前增加了46％。
    由于工厂解雇工人和减少工人工作时间以及其他因素，10月份美国全国的个人收入下降了十亿美元。而今年9月份又比8月份低了两亿美元。
    由于工资下降和生活费用继续上升，10月份制造业、建筑业、采矿业和农业工人的购买力比去年12月减少了3．3％。购买力的下降已经影响到贸易额的萎缩。9月份的零售贸易额连续第二个月下降。10月份百货公司的贸易额下跌到1956年2月以来的最低水平。
    美国报刊普遍认为，美国生产今后还要继续下降，经济衰退现在还只是处在初期。美国报刊列举出好些作为这种预测的根据的迹象。一个是过去支撑经济暂时“繁荣”的固定投资在减少。“美国研究所”根据对一千家公司的企业活动的研究估计，明年的固定投资将可能缩减七十亿美元。另一个是工作母机订货在下降。今年9月份，工作母机的订货比8月份下降了35％，比一年前的水平减少了63％。目前对钢铁的订货也减少了21％。此外，美国对外贸易也有缩减迹象。从今年3月到8月，美国的出口总额一直在下降，在9月份稍有上升之后10月份又下降了。
    在一定程度上是美国经济测候表的股票交易所正处长期不景气状态中。从今年7月中旬到10月，纽约交易所的股票价格降低了15％以上，挂牌的股票价值总共减少了二百五十多亿美元。虽然股票价格在不久前由于艾森豪威尔连续发表两篇叫嚷加紧备战演说的刺激而有所回升，但这几天又恢复了它下降的趋势。
    目前，美国政府在应付经济衰退上采取的措施是：用增加军费开支，放松银根等，来“刺激”经济活动。
