Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, November 23rd -- Reading the two documents of great historical significance – the Declaration of the Representatives of the Communist and Workers' Parties of Socialist Countries and the Peace Manifesto issued by the Conference of Communist and Workers' Parties – has become a major event in the political life of Shanghai's seven million people in the past two days. Shanghai newspapers have published these two declarations and news of the two conferences in red and in the most prominent positions. The entire staff of the Shanghai Post Office was mobilized to participate in the distribution of newspapers, striving to deliver the newspapers to readers as quickly as possible. The post office and the Liberation Daily temporarily dispatched five mobile retail vehicles to broadcast this good news to the city's residents. Crowds surged into the streets: workers riding tricycles, pastry shop apprentices with flour on their hands, construction workers working on scaffolding... all stopped their work and rushed to buy newspapers.

The working people of Shanghai read the two documents with excitement. The propagandist of the Shanghai Mining Machinery Factory set up a reading platform at the request of the workers and broadcast the full text of the documents to the workers through loudspeakers. Workers at the Jiangnan Shipyard bought more than 1,000 copies of newspapers carrying the Peace Manifesto today. Lin Guoguang, an old worker in the shipbuilding workshop, said: This declaration concentrates the will of peace-loving people all over the world. We working people love peace, and we must better build our socialist motherland, which is the best guarantee of peace. Today, more than 50 mothers at the Shanghai No. 17 Cotton Mill joined together to read the Peace Manifesto. Xu Xiuying, a textile worker with six children, said at the meeting: Four of my children grew up in the disasters of war. I understand the preciousness of peace, and I absolutely support the Peace Manifesto. Some employees of the Shanghai Poultry and Egg Company also held a forum to discuss the Peace Manifesto. Zhao Jiayuan, an elderly employee in his sixties, said: I have experienced many wars, and only now have I obtained a peaceful life. I love peace and resolutely oppose imperialists launching a new war.

Shanghai newspapers sold 400,000 more copies in these two days. Some party committees in Shanghai issued emergency notices requesting all units to organize the study of these two documents.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, November 23rd - In the past two days, workers in Shanghai have been talking everywhere about the profound content of the two documents, the "Declaration of the Representatives of the Communist and Workers' Parties of Socialist Countries" and the "Peace Manifesto". Workers generally believe that the two historical declarations issued by the representatives of the Communist and Workers' Parties of various countries mark a new and important stage in further strengthening the power of socialist countries. The current situation, as Chairman Mao said, is that "the East wind has prevailed over the West wind."

In the rural areas, the wired broadcasting network, which is 900 kilometers long, broadcast these two documents to the members of agricultural cooperatives through more than 6,000 loudspeakers. Chen Shengrong, a member of the Red Flag Agricultural Cooperative who had suffered from the hardships of war, said that our lives have been improving year by year in a peaceful environment, and my family is full of children and grandchildren, and my grandson has already entered high school. The "Peace Manifesto" truly speaks the minds of everyone.

University students enthusiastically read these two historic documents. Fourth-year students of the Chinese Department of Fudan University also held a forum today. The students said that more than 100 years ago, when Marx and Engels published the "Communist Manifesto," communism was only "a specter haunting Europe," but today the power of communism has surpassed the old world. We firmly believe that the future belongs to communism, and the future of our younger generation is infinitely bright.

    集中了爱好和平人们的意志
    上海人民热烈学习和讨论两个宣言
    本报上海23日电　阅读两个具有伟大历史意义的文献——社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议宣言和共产党和工人党代表会议发出的和平宣言——形成了昨今两天上海七百万人民政治生活中的一件大事。上海各报都以红色套版和最显著的地位发表了这两个宣言和两次会议的消息。上海市邮局全体总动员参加了报纸发行工作，争取尽快的把报纸送给读者。邮局和解放日报临时出动五辆流动零售车，向全市居民播送这个喜讯。人群像潮水一样拥向街头：踏着三轮车的工人，手上沾满了面粉的糕饼店徒工，正在脚手架上工作的建筑工人……都放下了工作，抢购报纸。
    上海的劳动人民以激动的心情阅读了两个文件。上海矿山机器厂的宣传员应工人们的要求搭起了阅读台，用广播喇叭向工人们广播了文件的全文。江南造船厂工人今天买了一千多份刊载和平宣言的报纸。造船车间老工人林国光说：这个宣言把全世界爱好和平的人们的意志集中起来了。我们劳动人民是热爱和平的，我们一定要更好地建设社会主义祖国，这是和平的最好保证。上海国棉十七厂今天有五十多个妈妈结合起来宣读了和平宣言。有着六个孩子的纺织女工徐秀英在会上说：我有四个孩子是在战争的灾难中长大的，我懂得和平的可贵，我绝对拥护和平宣言。上海市禽类蛋品公司部分职工也举行了座谈会，讨论和平宣言。六十多岁的老职员赵家元说：我经历过多次战争，到现在才得到了和平生活，我热爱和平，坚决反对帝国主义者发动新战争。
    这两天上海的报纸多售了四十万份。上海市一些党委机关发出了紧急通知，要求各单位组织学习这两个文件。
    据新华社上海23日电　这两天，上海的工人到处在谈论着“社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议宣言”和“和平宣言”这两个文献的深刻的内容。工人们普遍认为，各国共产党和工人党的代表会议发表的两个具有历史性的宣言，是进一步加强社会主义国家力量的新的重要阶段的标志。今天的形势，正如毛主席所讲的“东风已经压倒了西风”。
    在郊区农村，全长九百公里的有线广播网通过六千多个喇叭向农业社的社员们广播了这两个文献。深受过战争苦难的红旗农业社社员陈生荣说，在和平生活中我们生活年年提高，我家子孙满堂，孙子已经进了高中，“和平宣言”真是讲出了每一个人的心里话。
    大学生们欢欣鼓舞的阅读了这两个历史性的文献。复旦大学中文系四年级学生今天还举行了座谈会。学生们说，一百多年前马克思和恩格斯发表“共产党宣言”时，共产主义还只是“一个怪影在欧洲游荡着”，可是今天共产主义的力量已经超过了旧世界。我们完全相信未来是属于共产主义的，我们年青一代的前途是无比光辉的。
