Investigation of Living Conditions of Workers and Peasants in Hebei Province	Zhang Hua
I. The Living Standards of Peasants Exceed the Pre-War Level

    Several investigation materials prove that the actual income of farmers in Hebei Province, whether in cotton-producing areas with higher incomes or mountainous areas with poorer production conditions, generally exceeds the pre-war level. According to a typical survey in Shijiazhuang Prefecture, the living consumption level of middle and poor peasants in Zhoujiazhuang Village, Jin County, a cotton-producing area, increased by 60% and 120% respectively compared with 1936 (Note: The calculation method for comparing pre-war and current living standards is to convert prices at that time into grain, and then convert grain into currency according to the current grain price. Same below). The current living standards of middle and poor peasants in Huangyan Village, Huolu County, have doubled compared with pre-war levels. According to a survey conducted in She County, a mountainous area in Handan Prefecture, last year, among the 188 agricultural cooperatives in the county, except for 12 cooperatives that did not increase income, the remaining 176 cooperatives distributed an average of 41 yuan per person. If we add the income from household sideline occupations, private plots, and manure accumulation, the average annual income per person reaches 51.6 yuan. This figure exceeds the pre-war living standard of well-to-do middle peasants – an average of 45 to 50 yuan per person per year. She County is a deep mountainous county in Hebei Province with poor production conditions and cannot fully represent the situation in the mountainous areas of Hebei. Judging from the situation in typical villages such as Junying and Dongchuankou in Xingtai County, and Huangyan in Huolu County, which have better production in mountainous areas, the current average annual income of farmers has reached about 70 yuan per person, more than half the income of ordinary farmers before the war. According to a typical survey in Xiaopanshi Village, Yi County, a mountainous area in Baoding Prefecture, the actual income of farmers last year also increased by 42.4% compared with 1936.

    From many survey materials, the improvement of farmers' living standards is not an isolated phenomenon, but a general one. Except for a few well-to-do middle peasants and "Five Guarantees" households, the income of the original middle, poor, and hired peasants has generally increased significantly compared with pre-war levels. For example, among the 198 cooperative members in Huangyan Village, Huolu County, those who were originally middle peasants earned an average of 74 yuan per person last year, an increase of 54% compared with the average income of 48 yuan in 1936. The cooperative members who were originally poor peasants earned an average of 67 yuan per person last year, an increase of 91% compared with 35 yuan in 1936. The cooperative members who were originally hired peasants earned an average of 68 yuan per person last year, an increase of 119% compared with 31 yuan in 1936.

II. Workers' Income is More Than Double That of Peasants

    Surveys have shown that there are still certain differences between the current income of workers and peasants in general.

     (1) Zhangjiakou City conducted a survey on the lives of workers and peasants. The average annual income of employees and their families in the city is approximately 166.7 to 195.6 yuan per person. The average income of farmers in the suburbs of the city last year was approximately 81.83 yuan per person. Compared with the two, the average income of workers and their family members is approximately 203% to 239% of the average income of farmers, that is, one or more times higher than that of farmers.

     (2) The income situation of workers and peasants in the Baoding area also has the following comparison.

     According to a typical survey in Baoding City, in 1955 (because the nearby rural areas suffered disasters in 1956 and could not be compared, the 1955 materials were used), 1,290 employees in 14 units in the city supported (excluding themselves) 3,861 people, and their monthly wages and other income were approximately 64,147 yuan. The average monthly income of employees and their families was 12.5 yuan per person, and the annual income was 150 yuan.

     According to a typical survey and analysis of 120 peasant households in Baoding Prefecture during the same period, the average annual income per person in the prefecture was 84.4 yuan. Compared with employees in Baoding City, the income of workers and peasants in this area is also approximately two to one.

III. Workers' Living Expenses Are Double That of Peasants

    Workers and peasants have very different living expenses due to different production and living conditions. According to the situation in urban and rural areas of Hebei Province, the general level of living expenses in medium-sized cities is generally about twice as high as the same level of living in rural areas. According to the understanding in Shijiazhuang area, the average daily expense for a general middle-class life in Shijiazhuang city is about 8 to 10 yuan per person per month, while the expense for the same level of life in rural areas is about 5 yuan because there is no rent or utility bill to pay and non-staple foods (vegetables, eggs, etc.) and firewood are cheaper.

    Tangshan City conducted a survey on the lives of workers and peasants before the wage increase last year. The main findings of the survey were:

    The average monthly living expenses per person for 12 cooperative members of the 15th production team of the Shuguang Agricultural Cooperative in the suburbs were: upper class, 8.5 yuan; middle class, 7.5 yuan; lower class, 6 yuan; households in difficulty, 5 yuan.

    The daily living expenses of six urban households with lower-middle living standards (average monthly wage income of less than ten yuan per person) exceeded nearly half of the daily expenses of lower-middle living standards in the suburbs. According to the average statistics of three months, the various expenses of these six employee households per month are as follows: food 24.89 yuan, non-staple food 12.06 yuan, other food, fuel expenses, clothing daily necessities, cultural entertainment supplies, medicine, rent, utilities, service expenses, etc.

    The above totaled 66.58 yuan per household per month. The average number of people per household is 7.3, and the average daily consumption per person per month is 9.12 yuan. Compared with the daily expenses of farmers in the suburbs, this figure exceeds the farmers' upper-class life by 0.62 yuan, middle-class life by 1.62 yuan, lower-class life by 3.12 yuan, and nearly doubled the life of those in difficulty.

    However, Tangshan is a city with a strong industrial base and good living conditions such as houses and utilities. In some newly built or rapidly expanding cities, because there are fewer employee dormitories and poor living service facilities, the figure for employee living expenses will exceed the above standards. The income of Zhao Qingxuan, a weaver at the Daxing Yarn Factory in Shijiazhuang, can be seen in this situation. Zhao Qingxuan's monthly salary is 60 yuan, and his family of five spends the following on major expenses each month, accounting for the following percentages of his salary:

    Rent 6 yuan, accounting for 10% of the total salary
    Food 13 yuan, 21.6%
    Eating in the factory canteen every month 8 yuan, 13.3%
    Electricity and water bills 1 yuan, 1.6%
    Vegetable expenses 15 yuan, 25%
    Coal expenses 4 yuan, 6.6%
    Total 47 yuan, 78.3%

    In addition, there are expenses for oil, salt, seasoning, and clothing. Among them, the expenses for rent, utilities, vegetable expenses, and eating in the canteen, which are either unnecessary or very low in rural areas, account for half of the salary.

    From the above materials, the current life of workers is higher than that of peasants, but it is wrong to only see that the income of workers is higher than that of peasants and not see that the expenses of workers are greater than that of peasants, and thus think that the life of workers is too high compared to that of peasants.

IV. Some Peasants Have Caught Up With Workers' Living Standards

    In the course of investigation and research, it was also found that the income of members of a small number of agricultural cooperatives with a long history and good management has gradually approached or caught up with the income of urban workers in recent years. The Dachenzhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Ninghe County, a rice-producing area in Hebei Province, is an example. Since the establishment of this cooperative in 1952, its production income has increased more than three times in recent years with the support of national electric water lifting equipment. Since 1955, the average income per person has exceeded 180 yuan. Last year, after deducting the public accumulation fund and public welfare fund from the net income of 96,885 yuan, the average labor remuneration per person in the entire cooperative was 187.84 yuan. If we add the income of more than 1,400 yuan from the members' private plots, the average income per person reaches more than 190 yuan. Compared with the aforementioned average income of 166.7 to 195.6 yuan per person for employees and their families in Zhangjiakou, the income of farmers in this cooperative is close to or reaches the income level of urban employees. The figures comparing the income of farmers in this cooperative with the income of employees in various industries in Zhangjiakou are roughly as follows:

    Zhoujiazhuang, Jin County, is an agricultural production cooperative with relatively good production in the cotton-producing area of central Hebei. According to a survey in Shijiazhuang Prefecture, the current living consumption standard of cooperative members in this cooperative is approximately 135 yuan per person per year (132 yuan for new middle peasants and 137 yuan for old middle peasants).

    Compared with the above situation, the living standards of cooperative members in agricultural cooperatives with relatively good production and high income in the cotton-producing areas of Hebei are also approaching the living standards of urban workers.

    Due to the limitations of production conditions, the production and income of general grain-producing areas and mountainous areas in Hebei Province have developed significantly after cooperation, but there is still a certain difference compared with the living income of urban workers. However, this does not mean that these areas cannot catch up with the living standards of workers. For example, the actual income of cooperative members in the Jianming Agricultural Cooperative in Zunhua County, led by the nationally famous labor model Wang Guofan, reached an average of 110.04 yuan per person last year.

    Although agricultural cooperatives like Dachenzhuang and Zhoujiazhuang are advanced in Hebei, they are not special. The income of members of more than 200 advanced agricultural cooperatives that were piloted in the province around 1952 has generally increased significantly. According to typical surveys in several different regions, the amount of increase in recent years has generally exceeded more than half of that at the time of establishment. The average income per person in the Fumin Cooperative in Jinghai County, a coastal depression, increased from 35 yuan in 1954 to more than 95 yuan last year. Due to a large amount of land reclamation and the construction of rice fields, the planned income this year will increase to 210 yuan. The average income per person in the Shuimen Village Agricultural Cooperative in Xingtai County, a deep mountainous area, also increased from 65 yuan in 1953 to 91.8 yuan last year. It is also planned to increase to more than 100 yuan this year. Judging from the income growth of these old cooperatives, if there are no major disasters, with the support of the state, the income and life of cooperative members will soon approach or reach the level of urban employees. Even for some agricultural cooperatives with a shorter history, as long as they can run the cooperatives well, vigorously develop production and increase income, it is not difficult to reach the living standards of workers. Last year, most of the more than 100 award-winning agricultural cooperatives in Hebei Province reached the living standards of well-to-do middle peasants, with an average income of about 100 yuan per person. Among these cooperatives, many have only three or two years of history.

    河北省工人农民生活情况调查	张华
    一、农民的生活水平超过战前
    若干调查材料证明，目前河北农民的实际收入，无论收入较大的产棉区或生产条件较差的山区，一般都超过了战前的水平。据石家庄专区典型调查，棉产区晋县周家庄村中、贫农的生活消费水平，比1936年提高了60％和120％（按：战前与现在生活比较的计算方法是按当时物价折粮，再按现在粮价合成货币。下同）。获鹿县黄岩村目前中、贫农的生活，比战前提高了一倍左右。另据邯郸专区在山区涉县调查，去年全县一百八十八个农业社当中，除十二个没有增加收入的社以外，其余一百七十六个社，平均每人分得了四十一元。如果再加上社员的家庭副业、自留地收入和积肥挣款，平均每人全年收入即达到五十一元六角。这个数目，已超过了战前富裕中农生活——平均每人每年四十五至五十元的水平。涉县是河北省的一个深山县，生产条件太差，不能完全代表河北山区的情况。从邢台县军营、东川口、获鹿县黄岩等生产较好的山区典型村的情况来看，目前农民的年收入，平均每人已达到七十元左右，超过了战前一般农民收入一半多。另据保定专区山区易县小盘石村的典型调查，去年农民的实际收入，也比1936年增加了42．4％。
    从许多调查材料来看，农民生活水平的提高并不是个别的，而是普遍的。除去少数富裕中农和“五保”户以外，原来的中、贫、雇农的收入，一般都比战前有显著的增加。例如获鹿县黄岩村的一百九十八户社员中，原是中农的，去年平均每人收入了七十四元，比1936年平均收入四十八元，增加了54％。原是贫农的社员，去年平均每人收入了六十七元，比1936年的三十五元增加了91％。原是雇农的社员，去年平均每人收入六十八元，比1936年的三十一元提高了119％。
    二、工人比农民的收入多一倍多
    调查证明，目前工人和农民的收入，一般的说还是有一定的差别的。
      （一）张家口市对工人和农民的生活，曾经进行过调查。该市职工及其家属平均每人每年的收入大约为一百六十六点七到一百九十五点六元。该市郊区农民去年平均每人的收入约为八十一点八三元。两者相比，工人及其家属成员的平均收入大约为农民平均收入的203％到239％，即高于农民一倍或一倍多。
    （二）保定地区工人和农民生活收入的情况，也有以下的比较。
    据保定市的典型调查，1955年（因1956年附近农村遭灾不能比较，故用1955年材料）该市十四个单位一千二百九十名职工，共供养（本人除外）三千八百六十一人，每月工资及其他收入大约为六万四千一百四十七元，职工及其家属平均每人月收入为一十二点五元，年收入为一百五十元。
    另据同期保定专区对一百二十个农户家庭的典型调查分析，该专区农民平均每人的年收入为八十四点四元。与保定市职工相比，这个地区工人与农民的收入也大约为二比一。
    三、工人的生活开支比农民大一倍
    工人和农民由于生产和生活的条件不同，生活开支也有很大差别。根据河北省城乡的情况来看，中等城市内一般水平的生活消费开支，一般要高于乡村同等生活水平的一倍上下。据石家庄地区的了解，石家庄市内一般中等生活的日用开支，平均每人每月约需八元到十元，而农村的同等生活的开支，由于不拿房租水电费，副食品（蔬菜蛋类等）烧柴等便宜，大约有五元左右就够了。
    唐山市在去年增加工资前，曾对工人和农民的生活进行过调查。调查的主要情况是：
    郊区曙光农业社第十五生产队十二户社员每月平均每人的生活开支是：上等，每月平均每人的生活开支8．5元；中等，7．5元；下等，6元；困难户，5元。
    城市六户中下等生活水平（全家平均每人每月工资收入不满十元）职工家庭的日用生活开支，则超过郊区中下等生活日用开支近一半。根据三个月的平均统计，这六户职工每户每月各类的开支如下：粮食24．89元，副食品12．06元，其它食品、燃料开支、衣服日用杂品、文化娱乐用品、医药、房租水电、服务性开支等等。
    以上总计每户每月开支六十六点五八元。每户平均七点三人，平均每人每月日用消费为九点一二元。以这个数字与郊区农民日用开支相比，则分别超过农民上等生活0．62元、中等生活1．62元、下等生活3．12元、困难生活近一倍。
    但唐山是工业基础较强、房屋水电等生活条件较好的城市，如果在一些新建或扩建较快的城市中，因为职工宿舍较少，生活服务设备较差等，职工生活开支的数字，还会超过上述标准。从石家庄市大兴纱厂织布工人赵清轩家的收入数目，就可看到这种情况。赵清轩月薪六十元，全家五口人，每月几项主要开支及所占工资的比例是：
    房　租　6元　占工资总数　10％
    粮　食　13元　21．6％
    每月在厂食堂用饭　8元　13．3％
    电灯、水费　1元　1．6％
    菜　金　15元　25％
    煤　费　4元　6．6％
    合计　47元　78．3％
    此外尚有油盐作料和穿衣费用。其中仅农村无需开支或开支很少的房租、水电、菜金、食堂用饭等几项，即占去了工资的一半。
    从上述材料来看，现在工人的生活是高于农民的，但只看到工人比农民的收入高，看不到工人比农民的开支大，因而即认为工人生活比农民太高的看法，是不对的。
  四、有些农民已赶上工人的生活水平
    在调查研究当中，还发现了少数历史较长，办得较好的农业社的社员收入，几年来已逐步接近或赶上了城市工人的收入。河北省稻田区宁河县大陈庄农业生产合作社，就是一个例子。这个社从1952年建立起来后，几年来在国家电力扬水设备的扶持下，生产收入已增加了三倍多。从1955年开始，每人的平均收入即超过了一百八十元。去年从九万六千八百八十五元的纯收入中扣除了公积金、公益金后，全社平均每人分得劳动日报酬一百八十七点八四元。如果再加上社员自留地的一千四百多元的收入，每人的平均收入，即达一百九十元以上。如果以这个社的每人平均收入，与前述张家口职工及其家属平均每人一百六十六点七到一百九十五点六元的收入相比，这个社农民收入的即接近或达到了城市职工的收入水平。这个社农民与张家口市各行业职工收入比较的数字大体如下：
    晋县周家庄是冀中棉区一个生产较好的农业生产合作社。据石家庄专区调查，现在这个社的社员生活消费标准，全村平均每人每年约为一百三十五元左右（新中农一百三十二元，老中农一百三十七元）。
    以上述情况比较，河北棉区生产较好收入较高的农业社社员生活也接近了城市工人的生活水平。
    河北省一般产粮区和山区由于受生产条件的限制，合作化后生产与收入虽有显著的发展，但与城市工人生活收入比较，还有一定差别。但是这也不是说，这些地区就不能赶上工人的生活水平。例如全国著名的、劳动模范王国藩领导的遵化县建明农业社，去年社员的实际收入，平均每人即达到了一百一十元零四角。
    像大陈庄和周家庄这样的农业社在河北来说，虽说是先进的，但不是特殊的。该省1952年前后试办的二百多个高级农业社的社员收入，一般都有了显著的增长。根据几类不同地区的典型调查，几年来的增长数目，一般都超过建社时一半以上。沿海洼地静海县富民社去年全社平均每人收入，即由1954年的三十五元增加到九十五元多。由于大量垦荒增修稻田，今年的计划收入将再增到二百一十元。深山区邢台县水门村农业社，去年每人的平均收入，亦由1953年的六十五元增加到九十一元八角。今年亦计划增加到百元以上。从这些老社的收入增长情况来看，如果没有特大灾害，在国家支持下，社员收入及生活很快就要接近或达到城市职工的水平。即使是一些历史较短的农业社，只要能办好合作社大力发展生产增加收入，达到工人的生活水平也并不困难。去年河北省一百多个受奖的农业社大部达到富裕中农的生活水平，平均每人有了百元左右的收入。这些社当中就有不少社只有三两年的历史。
