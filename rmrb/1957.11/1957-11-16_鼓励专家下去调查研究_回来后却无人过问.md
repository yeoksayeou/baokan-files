    Encouraging Experts to Go Down for Investigation and Research, But No One Asks About It After They Return
    In February of this year, Pan Huaixu, a specially invited researcher at the Central Conservatory of National Music, proposed to Director Zhou Weizhi that he prepare to go to more than a dozen provinces and cities in the South and Northwest to investigate and collect research materials related to Yan Yue (ancient Chinese banquet music), and requested the Arts Bureau to allocate him a sum of investigation funds. Director Zhou Weizhi agreed and allocated him 3,500 yuan in funding. To facilitate his work, a young teaching assistant was transferred from the Art Normal College to be his assistant.
    In order to explore the national heritage and encourage such experts to do special research work, it is right to do so. However, after they went down for four or five months, traveled to many places, and returned to Beijing with a lot of valuable information, no one has asked about it. Mr. Pan has tried several times to report the situation to Director Zhou, but Director Zhou has not taken the time. This not only wastes a large amount of state funds, but more importantly, it has a negative impact on encouraging experts to engage in investigation and research work. It is hoped that the leadership can carefully consider this issue.

    鼓励专家下去调查研究  回来后却无人过问
    今年2月间，中央民族音乐研究所特邀研究员潘怀素先生向周巍峙局长提出，准备到南方、西北十几个省、市去调查搜集有关燕乐的研究资料，并要求艺术局拨给他一笔调查经费。周巍峙局长同意了，并拨给他三千五百元的经费。为了便利工作，还从艺术师范学院调了一位青年助教作他的助手。
    为了发掘民族遗产，鼓励这样的专家做专题研究工作，这样作是很对的。但是，当他们下去了四、五个月，走了很多地方，带着许多宝贵的资料回京以后，却没有人过问了。潘老先生曾几次想向周局长汇报一下情况，但周局长却一直没有抽出时间来。这样不仅浪费了国家大批经费，更重要地是对鼓励专家从事调查研究工作起了消极作用。希望领导上能慎重考虑这一问题。
