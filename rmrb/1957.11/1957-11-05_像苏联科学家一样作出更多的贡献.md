    Like Soviet Scientists, Make More Contributions
    Lin Qiaozhi, Director and Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences
    Currently, all parts of our country are preparing to solemnly and solemnly welcome the fortieth anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution, which has far-reaching significance for the whole world. All Chinese people are celebrating this epoch-making day in human history with unparalleled enthusiasm for building socialism. Our hearts are filled with the lofty respect and friendship for the great Soviet Communist Party and the people.
    In the past forty years, the Soviet people have not only liberated themselves and built a socialist society, but also pointed out the correct direction for the working people of the world.
    The great Soviet Communist Party led the brave Soviet people and accomplished earth-shattering undertakings in just forty years. It overthrew the feudal and reactionary Tsarist Russian rule, established the proletarian regime, smashed the barbaric and shameless intervention of fourteen countries, and defended this newly born socialist country which was still fighting alone at that time. During the Second World War, the Soviet working class experienced another severe test, which resulted in crushing the fascist German bandits, liberating many countries in Eastern Europe, and defeating the Japanese Kwantung Army, which powerfully helped the cause of liberation of the Chinese people. Today, the entire Soviet people are confidently engaged in communist construction, making every effort to defend world peace. This great spirit of loyalty to the motherland, the proletariat, and the working people of the world will always be our shining example to learn from.
    In less than half a century, this locomotive of human history has brought about one-third of the world's population into a truly democratic, free, and prosperous new world. The people of our new China, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, are advancing side by side with the Soviet big brother along this bright road.
    Although our country has a history of thousands of years, it is still a very young country in terms of the socialist camp. In the past, industry, agriculture, and science were very backward, but the progress in the past few years has been very rapid. Even the United Nations had to admit that the speed of industrial development in our country last year was the champion in the world. Our first five-year plan has been successfully completed, and now the world-famous Yangtze River Bridge has also been officially opened to traffic. Everyone of us is cheering for the happiness and prosperity of our motherland. We sincerely thank our Party, and we also sincerely thank the Soviet Party and the people. We know that these achievements are inseparable from the correctness of the Communist Party's policies and the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union. The Soviet government has sent its most experienced experts to work in our country, introduced first-class technology to us, and provided materials for all aspects of our country's construction. This kind of brotherly relationship between countries can only be found in the socialist world. Just from the department I am most familiar with, Comrade Korchagin, the leader of the Soviet expert group of the Ministry of Health who is currently helping our country to formulate a medical science research plan, is a famous Soviet scientist and organizer and leader of medical science research work. He is working diligently for our country's socialist construction, deeply understanding the situation, starting from the Chinese situation, combining the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, and studying every specific problem with Chinese experts. This will undoubtedly play an important role in the development of medical science in our country. As we warmly celebrate the fortieth anniversary of the October Revolution, we would like to express our gratitude and condolences to all comrades of the Soviet expert group of the Ministry of Health headed by Comrade Korchagin, and through them, extend our greetings to the Soviet brothers.
    At present, the Party is conducting profound socialist education among the people of the whole country. In the struggle against the bourgeois rightists' attack on the Party and socialism, we realize that there are also struggles between two lines in scientific development. Science serves the broad masses of the people and benefits mankind. This is the only correct direction for scientific development. The Soviet Union has leapt from a backward agricultural country to the most scientifically developed country in the world in forty years because it resolutely followed this path. The United States has also repeatedly flaunted itself, trying to dominate the world with "American science," but people are increasingly seeing through its essence and corrupt future. People do not deny that the science of this country is developed, but what is the result of this "development"? It is not the improvement and improvement of the lives of the working people, but the "oil king" and the "steel king" manipulate everything, but the atomic bomb and germ warfare for the purpose of killing. Coexisting with these is not the popularization of science but monopoly and patents. Science has become a criminal tool for a few people to get rich, invade and plunder, and kill and set fire. What benefits will such "scientific development" bring to people? On the contrary, it will only destroy or even destroy human happiness. This is a dangerous and degenerate road. Today, the United States is still hypocritically using these "sciences" to aid so-called backward countries, and its purpose is obvious, to invade and obtain greater profits.
    The Soviet Union is completely different from the United States. In 1953, when I visited the Soviet Union, I received an extremely profound ideological education. The Soviet Union has no big kings, let alone any patents. Science has a very clear direction, that is, according to the country's plan, subject to the needs of the people. People not only constantly enjoy new scientific achievements, but also scientific knowledge is rapidly improved. The people are not only the masters of society, but also the masters of nature. It was also at that time that I deeply understood why the Soviet obstetrics and gynecology departments have achieved such outstanding theoretical and practical achievements as "painless childbirth." It brought happiness to women all over the world. This is the inevitable contribution of obstetricians and gynecologists with socialist ideas, and it is the embodiment of the close integration of science and the interests of the people. I specifically realized that the development of scientific undertakings in the Soviet Union has also pointed out a correct path for the world.
    In recent years, the Soviet Union has made more and more achievements in science, making great and important contributions to world science. The extensive peaceful use of atomic energy has brought science into a new era; the recent successful launch of the artificial satellite that shocked the world has made it possible for mankind to go out of the scope of the earth and march toward a broader nature. This star shows that Soviet science has far surpassed the United States, so it will inevitably play a major role in world peace. We are very excited to pay attention to the activities of this "new moon" full of socialist superiority. We express our congratulations to the Soviet scientists with great joy, and pay tribute to the Soviet people.
    The history of the Soviet Union's march towards science for forty years is the most valuable mirror for our country's march towards science. The rightists attempted to use the name of opposing dogmatism to prevent us from learning from the Soviet Union. This trick has been completely exposed. We will never allow the future of Chinese science to be dragged into capitalism. We deeply realize that learning from the Soviet Union not only enables our country's scientific level to be improved rapidly, but also, more importantly, will not take the wrong path. We must better transform ourselves, resolutely fight for socialism under the leadership of the Party, and make more contributions to the motherland and world peace like Soviet scientists.

    像苏联科学家一样作出更多的贡献
    中国协和医学院妇产科主任教授　林巧稚
    现在，我国各地正在准备隆重而庄严地迎接这对全世界具有深远意义的十月社会主义革命四十周年，全中国人民都以建设社会主义的无比热诚来庆贺这个在人类历史上划时代的日子，我们内心里充满了对伟大的苏联共产党和人民的崇高的敬意和友谊。
    四十年来，苏联人民不仅解放了自己，建成了社会主义社会，而且为全世界劳动人民指出了正确的方向。
    伟大的苏联共产党领导着勇敢的苏联人民，在短短的四十年里，做了惊天动地的大事业。推翻了封建反动的帝俄统治，树立起无产阶级的政权，粉碎十四国的野蛮无耻的干涉，保卫了这个在当时还是孤军作战的新生的社会主义国家。在第二次世界大战期间，苏联工人阶级又经历了再一次的严重考验，结果是粉碎了法西斯德寇，解放了东欧很多国家，打败了日本关东军，有力地帮助了中国人民的解放事业。今天苏联全体人民正在满怀信心地进行共产主义建设，尽一切努力保卫世界和平，这种伟大的忠于祖国忠于无产阶级忠于全世界劳动人民的精神，永远是我们学习的光辉榜样。
    在不到半个世纪的时间里，这个人类历史的火车头已经把地球上约三分之一的人口带进了一个真正民主自由欣欣向荣的新世界。我们新中国的人民，在中国共产党的领导下，正在沿着这条光明大道和苏联老大哥并肩前进。
    我们的国家虽然有着几千年的历史，但从社会主义阵营来说，还是年纪很轻的国家。过去工业农业和科学都很落后，但是这几年的进步却是非常迅速的。就连联合国也不得不承认去年我国工业的发展速度是全世界的冠军。我们第一个五年计划已经胜利完成，现在举世闻名的长江大桥也已正式通车，我们每一个人都为我们祖国的幸福和繁荣而欢呼，我们由衷地感谢我们的党，我们也由衷地感激苏联的党和人民。我们知道这些成绩是和共产党的政策的正确和苏联的无私的援助分不开的。苏联政府派出了自己最有经验的专家来我国工作，把头等的技术介绍给我们，在物资上供给了我国建设各方面的需要，这种情同手足的国家关系，只有在社会主义世界里才能找到。就从我最熟悉的部门来说，现在正在帮助我国制定医学科学研究规划的卫生部苏联专家组组长柯尔切金同志，就是苏联著名科学家和医学科学研究工作的组织者和领导者，他辛勤地为我国的社会主义建设劳动着，深入地了解情况，从中国情况出发，结合苏联的先进经验，和中国专家一道研究每一个具体问题，这对我国医学科学的发展无疑会起着重要的作用。当我们热烈庆祝十月革命节四十周年的时候，我们谨向以柯尔切金同志为首的卫生部苏联专家组的全体同志们表示感谢和慰问，并通过他们向苏联兄弟们致意。
    目前党正在向全国人民进行深刻的社会主义教育。在反对资产阶级右派向党和社会主义进攻的斗争中，我们认识到在科学发展中也存在着两条路线的斗争。科学为广大人民服务，造福于人类，这是科学发展唯一正确的方向。苏联在四十年里从落后的农业国一跃而成为世界上科学最发达的国家，就是因为坚决走这条道路的结果。美国也曾一再眩耀自己，想以“美国科学”独霸世界，可是人们却越来越深刻地看穿了它的实质和腐朽的前途。人们并不否认这个国家的科学是发达的，但是这种“发达”的结果是什么呢？不是劳动人民生活的改善和提高，而是什么“煤油大王”、
  “钢铁大王”操纵一切，而是出现了以屠杀为目的的原子弹和细菌战。和这些并存的不是科学的普及而是垄断和专利，科学成为少数人发财致富、侵略掠夺、杀人放火的罪恶工具，这样的“科学发达”会给人们带来什么好处呢？相反地只会破坏甚至毁灭人类的幸福，这是一条危险堕落的道路。今天美国还在伪善地拿这些“科学”去援助所谓落后的国家，其目的很明显，就是为了侵略以取得更大的利润。
    苏联与美国完全两样。1953年我在苏联参观，我受到了一次极其深刻的思想教育。苏联既没有什么大王，更没有什么专利，科学有着很明确的方向，就是按国家的计划，服从于人民的需要。人民不但不断地享受着新的科学成果，而且科学知识也迅速地提高。人民不但是社会的主人，也是自然的主人。也就是在那个时候，我才深深地理解了为什么在苏联的妇产科会取得像“无痛分娩”那样杰出的在理论上和实践上的成就，它给全世界妇女带来了幸福，这正是具有社会主义思想的妇产科工作者必然的贡献，是科学和人民群众利益密切结合的体现。我具体的体会到，苏联的科学事业的发展也为全世界指出一条正确的道路。
    近几年来苏联在科学方面的成就越来越多，对世界科学作出很大的重要的贡献。广泛地和平利用原子能，使科学进入了一个新的时代；最近发射成功震动全球的人造卫星，使人类有可能走出了地球的范围向更广阔的大自然进军。这颗星显示了苏联的科学已远远地超过了美国，因此对世界和平也必将起着重大的作用，我们十分兴奋地注意这一满载社会主义优越性的“新月亮”的活动，我们以莫大欢欣的心情向苏联科学家们表示祝贺，向苏联人民致敬。
    苏联四十年来向科学进军的历史，正是我国向科学进军的最宝贵的借镜。右派分子企图假借反对教条主义的名义使我们不去学习苏联，这种鬼把戏已经完全被揭穿，我们绝不容许把中国科学的前途拖向资本主义。我们深刻地体会到，学习苏联不仅使我国科学水平迅速提高，而且还有更重要的一条就是不会走错了路。我们一定要更好地改造自己，坚决地在党的领导下为社会主义而奋斗，像苏联科学家一样为祖国为世界和平作出更多的贡献。
