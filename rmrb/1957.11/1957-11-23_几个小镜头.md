A Few Short Scenes

    Determined to be a Good Cadre
    Evening, at the Xipingzhuang Brigade headquarters.
    The oil lamp flickered. The cadres were discussing the opinions and criticisms raised by the masses, and the discussion was in full swing.
    Communist Party member Wang Kui said excitedly: "Most of the opinions raised by the villagers are correct. There are indeed many problems with the management of the manure yard. I have been at the manure yard for a year, and the members of the manure yard are sent by various teams. They are unfamiliar with the work, and coupled with my lack of strictness with myself, the leadership is very chaotic.” As soon as Wang Kui finished speaking, the brigade leader, Communist Party member Song Dekuan, followed closely: "The opinions raised by the villagers are valuable. There were shortcomings in the work of the brigade in 1957. I made mistakes of bureaucratism, and my attitude towards the villagers was not good. I was impatient. I should not have lent money to villagers who should have borrowed it, and I borrowed money from those who shouldn't. The main reason is that I did not go deep into the work. I will be determined to correct it in the future, and change it as soon as I say so, and never be insincere.”
    Communist Party member Xu Qingzhang said sincerely: "The opinions raised by the villagers are practical. The facts are just like that. As a party member, I can't play an exemplary role, which is not good. In the future, I should take the lead and obey the leadership of the team leader in my work. It is a fact that the villagers criticize me for being picky about my work, choosing the easy work and not doing the heavy work. The team leader asked me to pull corn stalks, but I didn't go, which is wrong.” Several people wrote down the opinions raised by the villagers and wanted to go back to the team to improve their work.
    The one who was uneasy and restless at the meeting was Sun Kui, because he could not hear the opinions raised by the villagers about him. He looked at the opinion book for a while, and then sat down again. Later, he stretched his head and asked the comrades of the work team: "You haven't missed the opinions of the villagers about me, have you! Why don't I have any?” The comrades of the work team said that the villagers did not raise any opinions about him. Sun Kui said: "Although the villagers have not yet raised their opinions about me during the rectification, it is because the villagers have not raised them or dare not raise them. As a squad leader, how can my work have no shortcomings? I hope the villagers will raise them to me, whatever they have, so that I can know and improve!"
    The next morning, Sun Kui gathered some of the team members and asked for their opinions on himself. For example, the villagers pointed out that he had recorded more work points for his son. His eldest son used the team's lamp oil to review his lessons, etc. He admitted that they were very correct and would correct them immediately, and was determined to be a good cadre.
    Days of Eating Coarse Grain
    Never Forget
    The members of the first team of the Niulufeng Brigade were debating whether unified purchase and sales were good or not. At the beginning, many people expressed their personal experiences, saying that "unified purchase and sales are really good, and we won't starve in disaster years and famine years. Prices are the same every year, and everyone can concentrate on production." Some also recalled the tragic situation before liberation, saying that they ate coarse grain during the Japanese rule, and people often starved to death on the streets of Mentou Village. However, there were also some different opinions at the time. For example, young Wang Yonghe said: "Are unified purchase and sales good? Where does the grain go? I still eat even without unified purchase and sales." Everyone looked at him with surprise. Someone questioned him:
    "Wang Yonghe, does your family grow rice?"
    "No."
    "Where does the rice you eat come from?"
    "It's transferred from other places."
    "You don't grow rice, but you can still eat rice. Isn't this the benefit of unified purchase and sales?" Another person also asked: "Wang Yonghe, have you eaten coarse grain?" Wang said: "I was only five or six years old when I ate coarse grain. I know that we only ate vegetables at that time." Zhou Yuqing said: "You haven't eaten coarse grain. Go home and ask your mother, and you will know whether unified purchase and sales are good or not?" The hard days of a mother and son depending on each other before liberation flashed through his mind one by one. The next day, while working, he muttered to himself: "I will never forget the days of eating coarse grain!"
    Returning Excess Private Plots
    Wang Fu of Sitongbei was dreaming of developing capitalism a month ago. He planned to expand his existing 1.67 mu of private plots to 3 mu before late autumn, buy a donkey, and drive the donkey to sell vegetables every day. Now, after the education of the great debate, he realized his mistake and told the cadres that he would return the excess private plots. From then on, he participated in the team's labor every day. At the general meeting tonight, he made a self-criticism. His self-criticism motivated many people to turn in their excess private plots.
    Why did Wang Fu change so quickly? It turned out that he was a poor peasant who had herded camels for ten years and watched the crops for six years. After liberation, he was allocated a few mu of land, and his second son went to middle school and received government subsidies every month. During the blooming and contending, the landlords and rich peasants launched a counterattack, demanding back their mules, horses, carts, land, and houses. He felt that the situation was not right. When the great debate began, some teams discussed the issue of private plots, and he felt very heavy in his heart. His second son also came back from school and repeatedly advised him to reconsider. He originally knew that socialism was good, and the team's production was getting better year by year. He said: Can socialism be realized if everyone is like me? Can the cooperative be run well? Too many private plots are a stumbling block to socialism. We are busy on both sides, and we can't take care of this side or that side. In the past, I was like a crow who couldn't see that he was black. I said that this cadre was not good and that cadre was not right without thinking about whether I was right or not. I only cared about myself. Now that I have handed over the land, I feel relaxed as if I have taken a gas-relieving pill.

    几个小镜头
    决心当个好干部
    晚上，在西平庄大队部里。
    油灯晃动着。干部们在这里讨论群众提出的意见和批评，讨论得正热火。
    共产党员王奎激动地说：“社员给我提的意见大部分是正确的，粪场管理的确问题不少。我来粪场一年了，粪场的成员是由各队派来的，人手生疏，又加上我对自己不严格，因此领导很乱。”王奎刚一闭嘴，大队长、共产党员宋德宽紧接着说：“社员提出的意见是宝贵的，1957年大队的工作是有缺点的，我犯了官僚主义，对社员态度不好，犯了急躁病。对社员该借的钱不借，不该借的借了，主要是工作不深入，今后要下定决心改正，说改就改，决不口是心非。”
    共产党员徐庆章诚恳地说：“社员给我提的意见是实际的，事实就是那样，我是党员起不了模范作用，这不行，今后应起带头作用，干活服从队长领导，社员对我提的干活挑肥拣瘦干轻的不干重的这是事实。队长叫我去拔玉米秸，我不去，这就不对。”有几个人把社员给自己提的意见记下来，要回到队里去改进工作。
    会上心神不安，坐立不定的就是孙奎，原因是他听不到社员对他提的意见，一忽儿看看意见簿，一忽儿又坐下来，后来伸头问工作组的同志说：“你们没有把社员对我的意见漏掉了吧！为什么没有我的呢？”工作组的同志说社员们没提你的意见。孙奎说：“整风中社员虽然还没有提我的意见，但这是社员还未提出或不敢提，我当分队长，工作哪里没有缺点呢。我希望社员给我提提，有什么提什么，这样好让我知道了有改进呀！”
    第二天一清早，孙奎就召集一部分队员，征求大家对自己的意见。如社员提出他给自己的儿子多记了工分。大儿子用社里的灯油温习功课等意见，他都承认提的很对，要马上改正，决心当个好干部。吃共合面的日子
    永远忘不了
    牛碌坟大队第一分队社员们在辩论统购统销好不好。一开始很多人就说出了亲身体会，都说“统购统销真正好，灾年荒年饿不倒，年年物价无异样，人人安心搞生产”。有的还回忆了解放前的悲惨情况，说日本统治时吃共合面，门头村街上常见饿死人。但是，当时也有些不同意见，如青年王永和说：“统购统销好不好？粮食统到哪里去啦？没有粮食统购统销我也一样吃饭。”大家都用惊奇的眼光瞧着他，有人质问他说：
    “王永和，你家种大米没有？”
    “没有。”
    “你吃的大米是从哪里来的？”
    “从外地调来的。”
    “你不种大米，可是也能吃到大米，这不是统购统销的好处吗？”另一个人也问：“王永和你吃过共合面没有？”王说：“吃共合面时我还是五六岁。我知道那时我们光吃菜。”周玉清说：“你没吃过共合面，你回家问问你妈，你就知道统购统销好不好？”解放前母子相依为命的艰苦日子，一幕一幕地在他脑子里翻着。第二天在干活的时候，他还自言自语的说：“吃共合面的日子永远忘不了！”
    退出过多的自留地
    四统碑的王福，在一个月之前还做着发展资本主义的美梦。他计划由现有的一亩六分七厘的自留地，在晚秋之前扩展到三亩，买一头毛驴，每天赶着毛驴去卖菜。现在经过大辩论的教育，他觉悟了，找干部表明态度，把过多的自留地退出来，以后每天他都参加社里劳动，在今天晚上的大会上作了检讨，他这检讨，带动了很多人也把过多的自留地交出来。
    王福转变为什么这样快呢？原来他本是个贫农，曾经拉过十年骆驼，看了六年青。解放后分了几亩地，二儿子念中学，每月都得到政府补助费。大鸣大放中，地主富农纷纷反攻倒算，要夺回骡马大车、土地房屋，他感觉到形势有些不对头。及至大辩论开始，有的队讨论起自留地问题，他心里就觉得很沉，二儿子从学校回来，也几次劝他该重行考虑考虑。他本来知道社会主义是好的，社里生产也是一年比一年好。他说：个个都像我这样，社会主义能实现吗？合作社能搞好吗？自留地多了是走社会主义的绊脚石，两头忙，这边顾不上，那边顾不着。过去我是老鸦瞧不见自己黑，东一枪西一炮的说这个干部不行，那个干部不对，没有想想自己对不对，一味只顾自己。现在交出了地像吃了顺气丸似的，我轻松了。
