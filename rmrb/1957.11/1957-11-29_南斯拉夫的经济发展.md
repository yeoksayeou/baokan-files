    The Economic Development of Yugoslavia	Dong Chengbin
    Today marks the twelfth anniversary of the founding of the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia. Since the establishment of the people's government, Yugoslavia has made significant achievements in economic construction. Yugoslavia, once a backward agricultural country, has now transformed into a relatively developed industrial-agricultural nation. The proportion of industrial output in the national income has increased from 25% in the pre-war year of 1939 to 47% in 1956. The total industrial output in 1956 was 2.7 times higher than the pre-war peak. In that year, Yugoslavia, with a population of just over 18 million, produced 5.047 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity, 17.1001 million tons of coal, 887,000 tons of steel, 293,600 tons of oil, 2,240 trucks, and 125,400 radios.
    Before World War II, Yugoslavia was one of the most backward countries in Europe. According to a 1921 survey, 80% of the country's able-bodied population was engaged in agriculture. Ten years later (in 1931), this figure was still above 76%, and this situation did not change much until the outbreak of World War II.
    The devastation of the war inflicted severe damage on Yugoslavia's already backward economy. During the war, 50% of Yugoslavia's industrial enterprises were completely or severely destroyed. A large number of means of transportation were looted or destroyed by the enemy. 20% of the residents were homeless, and nearly 300,000 farmers went bankrupt.
    In order to restore and develop the national economy and to lay the material foundation for socialism, the Yugoslav party and government first implemented measures for the nationalization of industry, followed by the implementation of the policy of socialist industrialization. In the process of developing industry, special attention was paid to heavy industry. For example, in the total industrial investment between 1947 and 1953, the power industry alone accounted for 35.9%, and the metallurgical industry accounted for 25.2%.
    Most of the large industrial investments yielded good results. Between 1946 and 1955, more than 250 modern industrial enterprises were put into production in Yugoslavia. Industrial sectors that did not exist in Yugoslavia in the past, such as the automotive, tractor, and aircraft industries, were established, and previously backward industrial sectors such as electric power, ferrous metallurgy, and the oil industry were greatly developed. The annual rate of industrial growth was also very high. For example, between 1953 and 1956, the average annual rate of industrial growth was nearly 13%. Industrial output in 1956 increased by 60% compared to 1952, and by 166% compared to before the war, with heavy industry production increasing more than eightfold compared to before the war.
    Due to the rapid development of industry, the number of industrial workers in the country increased from 300,000 before the war to 685,000 in 1954, and the agricultural population decreased from about 76% before the war to about 60%.
    In terms of developing agriculture, Yugoslavia has relatively good natural conditions. Due to the mild climate and fertile land, the vast majority of crops can be grown domestically. In 1955, the area cultivated for grain accounted for 73% of the total cultivated area. In that year, the country harvested a total of 7.26 million tons of grain. In order to expand the agricultural technological base, the government increased the total number of tractors in the country to 2.1 times the number in 1939 (a total of 7,200 tractors) in 1949. In 1956, Yugoslavia's agricultural machinery manufacturing industry was already able to produce 15,000 agricultural machines and 2,000 tractors, and it was preparing to double production within two or three years. According to 1956 statistics, the socialist component in agriculture already included about 900 state-owned farms, more than 5,500 general agricultural cooperatives (supply and marketing cooperatives), and more than 800 agricultural production cooperatives.
    With the restoration and development of industry and agriculture, the material living standards of the Yugoslav working people have also improved. If the real wage of a family of four in 1939 is taken as 100, it increased to 155 in 1954.
    The economic development of Yugoslavia, especially the development of heavy industry, has been tremendous in the past twelve years. However, according to Yugoslav newspapers and periodicals, Yugoslavia has also encountered some difficulties and problems that urgently need to be solved in its economic development. These problems are mainly manifested in the imbalance between industrial and agricultural development. In addition, handicrafts and light industry in industry have also experienced imbalances exceeding normal development in certain aspects.
    Yugoslavia's agriculture remains a backward economic sector to this day. Its production is increasing very slowly and has not yet recovered to its pre-war peak level. In the bumper harvest year of 1955, Yugoslavia's total agricultural output was only 2% higher than in 1939. In 1956, due to poor harvests, agricultural output decreased by 12% compared to 1955.
    In terms of socialist transformation of agriculture, in recent years more than 5,000 supply and marketing cooperatives have been established in rural Yugoslavia, while agricultural production cooperatives own only about 3% of the country's cultivated land. Currently, with the exception of state-owned farms (which own 9% of the country's cultivated land), about 78% of the country's cultivated land is still in the hands of individual farmers. Such decentralized management has made it difficult to develop large-scale, modern agriculture.
    The backwardness of agricultural production not only affects the development of light industry but also fails to meet residents' needs for grain. Therefore, Yugoslavia has to import large quantities of grain from abroad every year.
    In order to change the imbalances in economic development, especially the backwardness of light industry and agriculture, Yugoslavia has begun to take some concrete measures in recent years. In November 1955, Yugoslav President Tito spoke about the necessity of changing the direction of Yugoslavia's industrialization plan in a report on economic issues. In terms of investment, between 1947 and 1954, Yugoslavia's industrial investment accounted for more than 60% of the total national economic investment, but it had already decreased to 49.7% in 1955, and it will decrease further to 38.9% this year. The investment ratio between light and heavy industry has also changed.
    According to the draft of Yugoslavia's 1957-1961 economic development plan recently formulated, industrial production will increase by an average of more than 11% per year and agricultural production will increase by an average of 6% per year over the five years. The purpose of this plan is to eliminate economic imbalances, reduce the deficit in the balance of payments, and make the increase in total production more in line with total distribution. During this period, the development of agricultural production and other aspects directly related to agriculture will receive special attention. Non-economic allocations will also be greatly increased.

    南斯拉夫的经济发展	董成彬
    今天是南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国成立十二周年纪念日。在人民政权成立以来的时间里，南斯拉夫在经济建设方面已取得了重大的成就。南斯拉夫过去是一个落后的农业国，现在已变成为工业相当发达的工业—农业国家，工业产值在国民收入中所占的比重，已从战前1939年的25％增加到1956年的47％。1956年的工业总产量比战前最高水平增加为二点七倍。这一年，人口仅有一千八百多万的南斯拉夫生产了五十亿四千七百万度电，一千七百一十万零一千吨煤，八十八万七千吨钢，二十九万三千六百多吨石油，二千二百四十辆载重汽车，十二万五千四百多架收音机。
    在第二次世界大战以前，南斯拉夫是欧洲最落后的国家之一。根据1921年的调查，全国80％有劳动能力的人都从事农业。十年以后（即1931年），这个数字还在76％以上，一直到第二次世界大战爆发以前，这种情况并没有多大改变。
    战争的破坏使本来就落后的南斯拉夫经济又受到了严重的创伤。在战争中，南斯拉夫的50％的工业企业遭到了彻底的或者是严重的破坏。大批的交通工具被敌人劫走或者破坏了。20％的居民无家可归，几乎有三十万农民破产了。
    为了恢复和发展本国的经济，为了奠定社会主义的物质基础，南斯拉夫党和政府首先实行了工业国有化的措施，接着又执行了社会主义工业化的方针。在发展工业的过程中，重工业特别受到了重视。例如在1947—1953年间的全部工业投资中，单是动力工业就占35．9％，冶金工业就占25．2％。
    大量的工业投资在建设中大部分都得到了良好的结果。在1946—1955年间，南斯拉夫投入生产的现代化工业企业就有二百五十个以上。过去南斯拉夫不存在的工业部门如汽车、拖拉机、飞机工业等建立起来了，过去落后的工业部门如电力、黑色冶金和石油工业等大大地发展了。每年工业增长的速度也很高。例如在1953—1956年间，每年工业的平均增长速度将近达到13％。1956年的工业比1952年增长60％，比战前增长166％，而其中重工业的生产比战前增加了八倍以上。
    由于工业的迅速发展，全国的产业工人从战前的三十万人增加到1954年的六十八万五千人，农业人口从战前的76％左右降低到60％左右。
    在发展农业方面，南斯拉夫具备着相当良好的自然条件。由于气候温和和土地肥沃，绝大多数的农作物都可以在国内种植。1955年谷物耕种面积占全部耕地面积的73％，这一年全国收获的谷物共有七百二十六万吨。为了扩大农业技术基础，还在1949年政府就把全国拖拉机的总数增加到1939年的二点一倍
  （共有七千二百台拖拉机）。1956年南斯拉夫的农业机器制造业已经能够生产出一万五千台农业机器和两千台拖拉机，并且准备在两三年内把生产提高两倍。农业中的社会主义成分，据1956年的统计，全国已经约有九百个国营农场，五千五百多个一般性的农业合作社（供销合作社）和八百多个农业生产合作社。
    随着工农业的恢复和发展，南斯拉夫劳动人民的物质生活水平也有了提高。如果把1939年每一个四口之家的实际工资当作一百，那么1954年就增加到一百五十五。
    十二年来南斯拉夫的经济发展特别是重工业的发展是巨大的，但是据南斯拉夫报刊报道，南斯拉夫在发展经济中也碰到了一些困难和出现了一些亟待解决的问题。这些问题主要表现在工农业发展不平衡方面。此外，工业中手工业和轻工业也在某些方面出现了超过正常发展的不平衡。
    南斯拉夫的农业到目前为止仍然是一个落后的经济部门。它的生产增加很缓慢，还没有恢复到战前的最高水平。在1955年丰收的年景，南斯拉夫的农业总产量仅比1939年多2％。1956年由于歉收，农业产量比1955年下降了12％。
    在农业社会主义改造方面，近几年来南斯拉夫的农村中曾经成立了五千多个供销合作社，而农业生产合作社拥有的耕地仅占全国耕地的3％左右。目前除了国营农场（拥有全国耕地9％）以外，全国78％左右的耕地仍然掌握在个体农民手中。这样的分散经营给发展大规模的现代化农业带来了困难。
    农业部门的生产落后不仅影响了轻工业的发展，而且不能够满足居民对粮食的需要。因此南斯拉夫每年不得不从国外进口大批粮食。
    为了改变经济发展中不均衡状态，特别是轻工业和农业的落后状态，近几年来，南斯拉夫已经开始采取了一些具体措施。1955年11月，南斯拉夫总统铁托曾经在一个经济问题的报告中谈到了改变南斯拉夫工业化计划方针的必要性问题。从投资上看，在1947—1954年间，南斯拉夫的工业投资占全部国民经济的投资60％以上，而1955年已经减少到49．7％，今年将再减少到38．9％。轻重工业的投资比例也有改变。
    根据不久以前拟定的南斯拉夫1957—1961年经济发展计划草案规定，五年中工业生产平均每年将增加11％以上，农业生产平均每年将增加6％。这个计划的目的在于消除经济上的不平衡状态，减少支付平衡表中的赤字，使全部生产的增加同全部的分配更加适应起来。在这期间，农业生产的发展以及同农业直接有关的其他各方面的发展将受到特别的重视。非经济方面的拨款也将大为增加。
