Preventing Diseases in Forest Areas and Ensuring Workers' Health
Great Khingan Range Forest Area Establishes Medical Network

    This newspaper reports that in recent years, the medical and health undertakings in the Inner Mongolia Great Khingan Range Forest Industrial Zone have greatly developed. This forest area, when it returned to the hands of the people in 1945, had nothing but dilapidated forest farms left by the Japanese and puppet regime and diseases among the workers. The Party and the government started to build and develop Inner Mongolia's forest industry on such a broken foundation. Along with the development of the forest industry, the health and medical undertakings in the Great Khingan Range have developed from scratch, from small to large, and are growing and strengthening day by day.

    Now, in the Great Khingan Range forest industrial base, there are seven health and epidemic prevention stations, eight hospitals with four hundred beds, seven maternal and child health stations, forty-five workshop health clinics, and thirty-six midwifery stations. Each work team has non-detached health workers and first-aid kit equipment. In addition, in 1956, more than 30 traditional Chinese medicine practitioners were hired from Harbin and other places to carry out traditional Chinese medicine work in various hospitals. At present, in the forest sea of the Great Khingan Range, a health team of more than 500 people has been formed, forming a strong and solid health medical network. Medical workers are working day and night, traveling through workshops and work teams, ensuring the health of hundreds of thousands of employees and their families.

    In recent years, the entire forest area has vigorously carried out the Patriotic Health Campaign, held unprecedented mass clean-ups of garbage, dredging of ditches, filling of sewage pits, and five eliminations (rats, flies, mites, ticks, lice), and promoted the "three diligences" (diligent washing, diligent sunning, diligent sweeping) among employees, greatly improving the health conditions of employees and making the forest area's health outlook completely new. In particular, it has played a huge role in preventing diseases that endanger the health of forest workers, such as epidemic hemorrhagic fever and gastrointestinal infectious diseases. The incidence of epidemic hemorrhagic fever decreased by 14% in 1956 compared to 1955, and the first half of 1957 showed a significant decrease compared to the same period in 1956. For example, the incidence of gastrointestinal infectious diseases used to be 30% to 40%, but now it has been reduced to only 2% to 4%, basically controlling its occurrence and prevalence. Another example is "water dermatitis," which is most likely to occur among logging workers. Due to the continuous strengthening of water transport work, special health teams (stations) for logging operations are formed every year during the logging season, implementing a system of responsibility by section and team, and continuously improving preventive measures. This year, it has basically been controlled. Other diseases in the forest area have also been significantly reduced.

    In terms of medical treatment, there is not only a complete set of institutions, but also better equipment. In the employee hospitals, there are departments of internal medicine, surgery, traditional Chinese medicine, etc., and each department has a formal physician serving as the director of the department. General surgery can be done very well. In order to solve the treatment of difficult and complicated diseases in the forest area and to provide business guidance to various enterprise hospitals, a comprehensive central hospital with 160 beds and modern equipment was newly built not long ago.

    In terms of maternal and child health work, due to the establishment of midwifery stations at the grassroots level, the training of midwives, the promotion of new midwifery methods, and the promotion of new parenting methods, from 1953 to 1957, more than 4,900 new lives were born in the "Forest Sea."

    防治林区疾病　保证工人健康
    大兴安岭林区建立医疗网
    本报讯　几年来，内蒙古大兴安岭森林工业区医疗卫生事业有很大发展。这个林区在1945年回到人民的手里，当时除了日伪留给我们残破的林场和工人疾病之外，一无所有。党和政府就在这样破烂的基础上着手建设和发展内蒙古森林工业。伴随着森林工业的发展，大兴安岭上的卫生医疗事业，已经从无到有，由小到大，日新月异地发展壮大起来。
    现在，在大兴安岭森林工业基地上，有卫生防疫站七处，医院八处，病床达四百张；妇幼保健站七处，车间卫生所四十五个，助产站三十六处，每个工队都有不脱产的卫生员和保健箱的设备。此外，1956年还由哈尔滨等地聘请了三十多名中医中药人员，在各医院开展了中医工作。目前在大兴安岭林海里，已经形成了一支五百多人的卫生队伍，组成了坚强巩固的卫生医疗网，医务工作者都夜以继日、披星戴月地奔走在车间、工队，保证着十几万职工和家属的健康。
    几年来，全林区大力开展了爱国卫生运动，举行了空前规模的群众性清除垃圾，疏通沟渠，填平污水坑和五灭（鼠、蝇、螨、壁虱、虱），并推动职工开展了三勤（勤洗、勤晒、勤扫），大大改善了职工的卫生状况，使林区卫生面貌焕然一新。尤其是对危害林区职工健康的疾病——流行性出血热、胃肠传染病的预防起了极大的作用。流行性出血热的发病率，1956年比1955年降低14％，1957年上半年比1956年同一时期又有了显著的降低。又如胃肠传染病的发病率过去为30％至40％，目前已降低到只有2％至4％，基本上控制了它的发生和流行。又如流送作业工人最易发生的“下水皮炎”，由于不断加强水运方面工作，每年在流送季节里，都专门组成流送作业的保健队（站），实行分段分队负责制，以及在预防措施上不断改进，今年已基本能控制了。林区其它的疾病也有了显著的减少。
    在医疗上，不仅有了一套完整的机构，同时还有较好的设备。在职工医院里都设有内、外、中医等科，每科都有正式医师担当科主任，一般外科手术都能作得很好。为解决林区疑难病的医治，以及对各企业医院业务上的指导，不久前又新建了设有一百六十张病床的现代化设备的综合性中心医院。
    在妇幼卫生工作方面，由于在基层建立了助产站，培养了接生员，推广了新法接生，宣传了新法育儿，从1953年到1957年，有四千九百多个新生命在“林海”里诞生。　　（张健）
