Xinhua News Agency, November 9th: Cairo dispatch: According to the "Al Masaa" newspaper on the 8th, Turkey and Israel are colluding in an attempt to expand their influence in the Middle East.

The newspaper said that Turkish Prime Minister Menderes had written to Israeli Prime Minister Ben-Gurion, stating that Turkey agreed that Israel "has the right to freely pass through the Suez Canal and the Gulf of Aqaba" and recognized Israel's "historical rights to Palestine." In exchange, Israel should recognize "Turkey's legitimate rights to Iskenderun (i.e., Alexandretta)" and support "Turkey's Cyprus policy."

"Al Masaa" also published photos of the first and third pages of Turkish Prime Minister's letter.

Iskenderun (i.e., Alexandretta), currently controlled by Turkey, is located north of Aleppo in Syria. The area has more Arab residents than Turkish residents. It was ceded to Turkey by France in 1939, when Syria was a French mandate. After Syria's independence, it has been a disputed area between Syria and Turkey.

    土耳其和以色列狼狈为奸
    妄图在中东地区扩张势力
    新华社9日讯　开罗消息：据“晚报”8日报道，土耳其和以色列正在进行勾结，以谋在中东扩张势力。
    这家报纸说，土耳其总理曼德列斯曾经写信告诉以色列总理本—古里安说，土耳其同意以色列“有权利自由通过苏伊士运河和亚喀巴湾”，并且承认以色列“对巴勒斯坦的历史权利”。作为交换条件，以色列应当承认“土耳其对伊斯肯德伦（即亚历山大勒达）的合法权利”，并且支持“土耳其的塞浦路斯政策”。
    “晚报”还刊载了土耳其总理这封信件的第一页和第三页的照片。
    目前由土耳其控制的伊斯肯德伦（即亚历山大勒达）在叙利亚的阿勒颇以北。该地阿拉伯居民多于土耳其居民。1939年被法国割让给土耳其，当时叙利亚是法国的委任统治地。叙利亚独立后，它一直是叙利亚和土耳其之间争执的地方。
