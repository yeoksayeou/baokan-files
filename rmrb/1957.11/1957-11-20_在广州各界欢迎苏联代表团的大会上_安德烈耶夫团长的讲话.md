Comrades!

Our delegation came to China from the Soviet Union at the invitation of the National Committee for the Celebration of the 40th Anniversary of the October Revolution by the Chinese People.

We would like to extend our greetings to all of you present here—representatives of various social organizations in Guangzhou—and through you, to all the working people of Guangzhou and Guangdong Province. We convey to you the warm wishes of people from all walks of life and all the working people of the Soviet Union, wishing you achievements in the cause of socialist construction.

Dear Comrades!

We have been on the land of People's China for about two weeks now. We participated in the celebrations of the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution in your capital, Beijing. During this period, the delegation visited many cities in your beautiful country, visited many factories and agricultural cooperatives, and had many meetings with workers, farmers, intellectuals, and youth.

Wherever we went, the first thing we saw and felt was the wholehearted spiritual and political unity of the entire Chinese people and the fervent desire of the Chinese people to carry out the socialist transformation of their country.

Everywhere we see the tenacious and indomitable efforts of working people in all walks of life to achieve this goal quickly. The unity of the victorious people is the fundamental condition for achieving all achievements.

Everywhere, we feel the great trust of the people in the Chinese Communist Party and the great prestige of the Communist Party among the masses, and see the leading role of the Party in all undertakings.

Finally, what particularly moved our delegation was the sincere friendship and love of the Chinese people for the Soviet Union. This is vividly expressed in the grand celebration by the Chinese people and the Chinese Communist Party of the 40th anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution.

Let the friendship between our two peoples be further consolidated! This friendship is a great force for defending peace and building communism.

Of course, we Soviets know that there are still many difficulties to be overcome on your road; however, the difficulties encountered by the Soviet people in the past may not be less than yours, but rather more, because our people were the first to gloriously begin the socialist revolution.

Looking back at everything the Soviet people have experienced in the forty years since the October Revolution, one will see that the road they have traveled is not easy, but rather a road of hard struggle and labor.

The proletarian revolution of October 1917 was relatively easy to win. In just one day, the armed uprising of workers and soldiers ended the rule of landlords and capitalists. Subsequently, within a few days, Soviet power triumphed throughout the country.

However, the main difficulty was after the October Revolution. At that time, the Russian reactionaries formed an alliance with international imperialism to jointly oppose the young Soviet Republic and forced our people to conduct a brutal civil war lasting nearly four years. This civil war ended with the complete defeat of the White bandits and foreign interventionists.

Subsequently, the arduous years of restoring completely destroyed industry, transportation, and agriculture began, which took almost ten years. Only after this did the Soviet people begin to build new socialist industry and transportation, and at the same time guide the scattered small-scale peasant economy onto the socialist track.

In the following ten years, a new, first-class equipped socialist industry was established, and collective farms and state farms were established on the basis of a scattered small-scale peasant economy.

After establishing our own industry and transforming agriculture, our country developed at the fastest speed. If German fascism had not imposed a devastating war on us, the Soviet Union would have caught up with the most developed capitalist country—the United States—in terms of industrial production levels long ago, and in some respects might have even surpassed it. The price we paid for the war is at least equal to two or three five-year plans; however, at that time, American monopoly capital accelerated its development and made a fortune from the war.

Comrades, I am not prepared to talk to you here about all the difficulties that the Soviet people have overcome in order to raise their country's economy and culture to the level it has today. The difficulties in our socialist construction arise from the fact that socialist construction is carried out in an environment of struggle against external capitalist enemies. We fought for almost eighteen years. For thirty years, the Soviet Union was the only socialist country in the world. We lacked experience and took a rugged road unknown to anyone to socialism.

Now, the main difficulties have passed. The Soviet people have fundamentally transformed their country according to socialist principles.

Comrades! Now we have built a first-class socialist industry, the country's plan is developing rapidly, and agriculture—collective farms and state farms—is also armed with sophisticated technology, all of which makes it possible for us to greatly increase the sown area.

Now, the Soviet Union is not only not lagging behind but also far surpassing developed capitalist countries, including the United States, in many aspects of science and technology.

Our country already has very excellent scientific and technical cadres and countless scientific research institutions, which have made great reforms in many scientific and technological fields such as atomic energy, jet technology, and aviation. The Soviet Union has successfully launched two artificial satellites, thus opening up a new era for mankind to conquer nature.

In terms of culture, the Soviet Union has long since completely eliminated illiteracy and is beginning to transition to universal secondary education for young people. Our country has trained a large army of Soviet intellectuals. The multi-ethnic Soviet art is also developing and prospering.

From the point of view of ensuring national defense capabilities, the Soviet army has more than once proved itself to be superior to the armies of first-class capitalist countries.

However, it is incomplete to only list the above facts as a summary of our victory, because it is very important that the Soviet Union is no longer the only socialist country. There are also twelve countries with a population of 700 million advancing along the road opened up by the October Revolution. The invincible force of the socialist camp lies in the friendship between the peoples of these countries.

Comrades! Today I would like to especially emphasize the great significance of the friendship between the two major nations of the Soviet Union and People's China. The convergence of these two forces alone is enough to make the cause of socialism completely invincible and world peace victorious!

The friendship between our two peoples is based on the common foundation of socialist and communist ideas. The Sino-Soviet friendship alliance was forged with the blood of the outstanding sons and daughters of our two peoples as early as the October Revolution and the domestic war.

The friendship and alliance between our two nations was forged in the common struggle of the Chinese and Soviet peoples against Japanese imperialism during the years of World War II.

The friendship between our two peoples was born in the flames of the struggle for common interests, and it is permanent and unbreakable.

Comrades! The Soviet people are watching with the greatest concern how People's China is moving from backwardness to progress and how it is moving towards the victory of socialism in all aspects of the economy, culture, and the material life of the people.

It is no exaggeration to say that People's China's speed in socialist construction is much faster than that of the Soviet people in the early days of the founding of the country. After seven or eight years, you have already had new socialist enterprises, automobile manufacturing plants, and other factories put into production. Advanced agricultural producers' cooperatives have been firmly established in the countryside.

Due to special historical conditions and difficulties, we were only able to start building new enterprises and organizing individual farmers into collective farms fifteen years after the founding of our country. You are doing this faster in this regard.

The Soviet people are happily celebrating the achievements of their loyal friend and brother—the Chinese people—and wish the Chinese people further achievements in the great cause of socialist construction!

We know that these achievements of the Chinese people are the result of the wise leadership of the glorious Chinese Communist Party, the vanguard of the long-tempered Chinese working people.

The Soviet people admire the Chinese Communist Party headed by the Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong for its fortitude and the spirit of consistent implementation of Marxism-Leninism!

Dear Comrades! Please allow me to once again express to you our warm and heartfelt wishes from the Soviet people, and wish you achievements in the great cause of building a new socialist China!

Long live the great Chinese people and the glorious Chinese Communist Party! Long live the unbreakable friendship and cooperation between the Soviet and Chinese peoples!

Long live world peace!

### 在广州各界欢迎苏联代表团的大会上  安德烈耶夫团长的讲话

    在广州各界欢迎苏联代表团的大会上
    安德烈耶夫团长的讲话亲爱的同志们：
    我们代表团应中国人民庆祝十月革命四十周年全国委员会的邀请，从苏联来到中国。
    我们谨向在座的诸位——广州市各社会团体的代表们通过你们向广州市与广东省的全体劳动人民致意。向你们转致苏联各界和全体苏联劳动人民对你们的热诚祝愿，祝你们在社会主义建设事业中取得成就。
    亲爱的同志们！
    我们置身于人民中国的土地上已经有两个礼拜左右了。我们曾在你们的首都——北京参加了十月革命四十周年的庆祝活动。在这个期间，代表团到过你们美丽国家的许多城市，访问过许多工厂和农业合作社，跟工人、农民、知识分子和青年有过许多次的会见。
    无论我们来到任何地方，我们首先看到和感觉到的，是整个中国人民全心全意的在精神上和政治上的团结一致以及中国人民全心全意的对自己的国家进行社会主义改造的热烈愿望。
    我们到处都看到各行各业的劳动人民为了迅速地达到这个目标所表现的顽强与百折不挠的努力。而胜利了的人民的团结一致则是取得一切成就的基本条件。
    在任何地方，我们都感到人民对中国共产党的巨大信任和共产党在群众中的巨大威信，看到党对一切事业的领导作用。
    最后还有一点是，特别使我们代表团感动的是中国人民对于苏联的真挚友谊和热爱。这一点鲜明地表现在：中国人民和中国共产党以一场盛大的规模隆重地庆祝十月社会主义革命四十周年。
    让我们两国人民之间的友谊进一步巩固吧！这个友谊是保卫和平、建设共产主义的伟大力量。
    当然，我们苏联人知道在你们的道路上还有许多有待克服的困难；但是，苏联人民过去所遭遇的困难也许不仅不少于你们，相反地却是更多，那是由于我国人民首先光荣的开始了社会主义革命。
    现在回顾一下十月革命以后四十年间苏联人民所经受过的一切时，人们就会看到他所走过的道路不仅不是轻车熟路，相反地却是一场艰苦的斗争与劳动的道路。
    1917年10月无产阶级革命是比较容易的取得胜利。仅仅一天功夫工人与士兵的武装起义就结束了地主、资本家的政权。随后，在几天之内，苏维埃政权就在全国范围取得了胜利。
    但是，主要的困难还是在十月革命以后。那时，俄国反动派跟国际帝国主义结成了联盟共同来反对年轻的苏维埃共和国，并强使我国人民进行一场历时将近四年的残酷的内战。这场内战是以白匪军和外国干涉者的彻底溃败而告终的。
    随后，开始了恢复完全遭受破坏的工业、运输业和农业的艰苦岁月，几乎花费了十年的时间。只是在这以后，苏联人民才开始着手建立新的社会主义工业、运输业，同时把分散的小农经济引导到社会主义的轨道上来。
    在以后的十年间建立起了新的、具有头等装备的社会主义工业，并在分散的小农经济的基础上建立起集体农庄和国营农场。
      建立起本国的工业和改造了农业以后，我们的国家是以最快的速度向前发展着。如果不是德国法西斯强把一场毁灭性的战争加于我们身上，苏联在工业生产水平方面早就赶上了最发达的资本主义国家——美国，而在某些方面甚至还能超过它。我们对付给战争的代价至少等于两、三个五年计划；可是，在那个时候美国垄断资本却加快了自己的发展速度并发了一笔战争财。
      同志们，在这里我不准备跟你们谈，苏联人民为了把自己国家的经济与文化提高到今天已有的水平所克服了的全部困难。我国社会主义建设中困难是由于社会主义建设是在跟外部的资本主义敌人包围作斗争的环境中进行而产生的。几乎打了十八年的仗。三十年间，苏联一直是世界上唯一的社会主义国家。我们是在缺乏经验，沿着一条无人知晓的崎岖道路走上社会主义的。
    现在，主要的困难已成过去了。苏联人民已经按照社会主义的原则把自己的国家从根本上改造过来了。
    同志们！现在我们已建成了头等的社会主义工业，国家的计划迅速地发展着，农业——集体农庄和国营农场也用精湛的技术武装起来了，所有这一切使我们有可能大大地增加播种面积。
    现在，苏联在科学、技术的许多方面不仅不落后而且大大地超越资本主义发达的国家，其中也包括美国。
    我国已经拥有十分优秀的科学技术干部和无数科学研究机构，他们在原子能、喷气技术、航空等许多科学技术领域中作出了伟大的改革。苏联已经顺利地发射了两颗人造卫星从而开辟了人类征服大自然的新纪元。
    在文化方面，苏联早已全部消灭了文盲，并开始过渡到对青年进行普遍的中等教育。我国已经培养出一支人数众多的苏维埃知识分子大军。多民族的苏维埃艺术也发展繁荣起来了。
    从保证国防能力的观点出发，苏联的军队已经不止一次地证明了自己比头等的资本主义国家军队还要优越。
    但是，只列举以上的事实，我们的胜利总结还是不完全的，因为很重要的一点是：苏联现在已不再是唯一的社会主义国家了。沿着十月革命所开辟的道路前进的，还有七亿人口的十二个国家。社会主义阵营不可战胜的力量就在于这些国家人民之间的友谊。
    同志们！今天我想特别强调一下苏联和人民中国这两大民族之间友谊的巨大意义，仅是这两种力量的汇合，就足以使社会主义事业完全不可被战胜，世界和平得到胜利！
    我们两国人民的友谊是奠基于社会主义和共产主义思想的共同基础之上的。中苏友好同盟早在十月革命和国内的战争时期是用我们两国人民优秀儿女的鲜血凝结起来的。
    我们两大民族之间的友谊和同盟，是在第二次世界大战的年代里中苏两国人民反对日本帝国主义的共同斗争中结成的。
    我们两国人民的友谊，是在为了共同的利益而进行的斗争的火焰中诞生的，它是永久的和牢不可破的。
    同志们！苏联人民以最大的关怀注视着人民中国怎样从落后走上进步，怎样在经济、文化和人民物质生活的各个方面走上社会主义的胜利。
    可以毫不夸大地说，人民中国在社会主义建设方面的速度是比苏联人民在建国初期要快得多的。经过七、八年时间，你们已经有新的社会主义企业、汽车制造工厂以及其他工厂投入生产。在农村已巩固地建立起高级农业生产合作社。
    由于特殊的历史条件和困难，我们在建国十五年后，才能开始建立新的企业，将个体农民组成集体农庄，你们在这方面进行得更快些。
    苏联人民以愉快的心情庆祝自己忠实的朋友和兄弟——中国人民的成就，并祝中国人民在社会主义建设的伟大事业中获得进一步的成就！
    我们知道，中国人民所取得的这些成就，是由于久经锻炼的中国劳动人民的先锋队——光荣的中国共产党英明领导的结果。
    苏联人民赞美以中央委员会和毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党的刚毅、马克思、列宁主义的坚定贯彻始终的精神！
    亲爱的同志们！请允许我再一次的向您们表达我们苏联人民的热烈和衷心的祝愿，祝你们在建设新的社会主义的中国的伟大事业中获得成就！
    伟大的中国人民和光荣的中国共产党万岁！苏中两国人民牢不可破的友谊和合作繁荣万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
                （新华社广州18日电）
