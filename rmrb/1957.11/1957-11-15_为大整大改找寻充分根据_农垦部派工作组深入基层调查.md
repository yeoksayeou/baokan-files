Xinhua News Agency, 14th: Combining the airing of views by the staff of the agencies with in-depth investigation and research at the grassroots level is a measure taken by the Ministry of State Farms and Land Reclamation to thoroughly carry out the rectification work. The six work groups of the Ministry, led by bureau and division chiefs, and sent to state farms and agricultural machinery supply stations in Heilongjiang, Liaoning, Jiangsu, Hunan, Jiangxi, and other provinces, already departed on the 11th. The other four work groups, going to Inner Mongolia, Hubei, and other places, will also depart soon. These work groups are scheduled to return to the Ministry around December 20th. While participating in labor at the farms and stations, the personnel of the work groups will extensively solicit opinions from the staff and workers of the farms and stations on the leadership work of the Ministry of State Farms and Land Reclamation, and on how to run state farms well, as one of the bases for the Ministry's major rectification and improvement.
    The rectification movement in the Ministry of State Farms and Land Reclamation entered its third stage on October 31st. In the past ten days or so, a high tide of airing views has been set off. 70% of the personnel participating in the rectification within the Ministry have put up big-character posters. 77% of the division-level and above cadres at home have written big-character posters. Party members and League members who have written big-character posters account for 80% of the Party members and League members at home. Among the more than 300 opinions raised on the big-character posters, the most are on organizational structure, scope of responsibilities, and business aspects, accounting for 54% of the total number of big-character posters.
    The leadership of the Ministry of State Farms and Land Reclamation attaches great importance to the opinions of the masses. The Ministry has already established five rectification and improvement groups, which are responsible for dividing the work on issues such as guiding principles and tasks, systems, administrative affairs, personnel work, business issues, and Party-masses relations. Members of the Ministry's rectification core group personally serve as the leaders of the rectification and improvement groups. These groups conduct research separately based on the opinions raised in the big-character posters and symposiums. What can be changed will be changed in a timely manner and announced in a timely manner. Major issues are prepared to be resolved through thematic airing of views and debates.
