The Guy Mollet Cabinet - A Product of "Weariness"
By our commentator

On November 5th, the French National Assembly approved Félix Gaillard, a Radical Socialist and former Minister of Finance in the Bourgès-Maunoury cabinet, as the new Prime Minister. The French government crisis, which had lasted for five weeks, has finally come to a temporary end.

The fall of the Bourgès-Maunoury cabinet was the result of the Algerian colonial war and the financial crisis, which sharpened the internal contradictions within the French ruling group. In the process of forming a new cabinet, these difficulties and contradictions were further demonstrated. French President Coty successively invited Socialist leader Mollet, leader of the Democratic Socialist Resistance Union Pleven, Conservative leader Pinay, and leader of the Popular Republican Movement Schuman to form a cabinet; however, some dared not accept, some retreated after trying, and some requested authorization from the National Assembly but were rebuffed. Therefore, the comments of political observers in Paris on this government crisis were full of anxious cries. It was even rumored that President Coty, feeling despair at finding a new Prime Minister, was prepared to tender his resignation.

At this moment, Gaillard actually came to power. His cabinet list included members of parties, from the Socialist Party to the Conservative Party, who had been fiercely arguing with each other. Gaillard boasted that he had promoted "broad unity" among those parties.

Is this really the case? The answer is, of course, negative. The internal contradictions within the French ruling group have developed so sharply because France's colonial policy in Algeria is in a dead end and because the domestic financial situation has become very serious. The Mollet government fell because of this, and the Bourgès-Maunoury government fell because of this as well. And Gaillard's program for forming a cabinet does not provide any new solutions to these two difficulties.

Regarding the Algerian question, the fact that Lacoste, who is directly responsible for guiding the colonial military suppression of the Algerian people, remains the Resident Minister in Algeria shows that Gaillard is merely inheriting the mantle of Mollet and Bourgès-Maunoury. And the Conservatives' agreement to participate in the cabinet further illustrates Gaillard's compromise with the North African colonial bloc on this issue.

Due to the increasingly deteriorating military situation in Algeria, the French ruling group has serious differences of opinion on how to maintain French colonial rule in Algeria. Some people believe that, in addition to military suppression, some political tricks such as "reforms" are also needed. However, the so-called Conservatives oppose any "reforms," even formal ones, and insist on strengthening military suppression. The so-called "Fundamental Law" draft on Algeria of the original Bourgès-Maunoury government took into account the opinions advocated by the former group while trying to cater to the demands of the latter group, and then submitted it to the National Assembly for discussion. Due to sharp contradictions, the "Fundamental Law" draft failed to pass, and the government fell. On this issue, Gaillard has already stated that he still wants to formulate a law similar to the "Fundamental Law" and that the special powers bill drafted by the previous government should be put to a vote "in its current form." On this current key issue that affects the French political and economic situation, Gaillard has not reduced the contradictions in the slightest.

As for financial and economic issues, a simple review of Gaillard's performance during the few months when he was directly in charge of financial power in the Bourgès-Maunoury government makes it easy to estimate the value of his current program. During his tenure as Minister of Finance, Gaillard took so-called "emergency measures" in an attempt to improve the financial situation. As a result, the franc was devalued by 20%, the foreign trade deficit continued to increase, and foreign exchange reserves were completely exhausted; despite repeated tax increases and continuous cuts in social welfare spending, the national treasury was still empty and had to continue to borrow from the Bank of France to maintain itself.

The fundamental problem is that the French economy can no longer bear the heavy burden of the Algerian war expenditure. Since the Gaillard government has announced that it will continue to engage in Algeria, it is impossible to imagine that it can find any effective way to solve the financial crisis.

Given this situation, what is the reason why Gaillard was able to easily come to power after some established figures had failed to form a cabinet? It is not surprising. As early as when Gaillard was first invited to form a cabinet, "Agence France-Presse" quoted the predictions of political observers in Paris in a news report: "Because the parliament is extremely weary, Gaillard may succeed this time." The word "weariness" conceals the essence of the matter. To put it more clearly: the French ruling group realized that a situation without a government for a long time would be unfavorable to everyone. Especially at present, the UN General Assembly is about to discuss the Algerian issue; the Algerian National Liberation Army has launched a large-scale offensive; the domestic financial situation is very urgent; the labor movement is flourishing; the international situation has undergone new major developments, and Western countries have decided to hold a summit meeting for emergency consultations. … Under these circumstances, it is necessary to quickly end this government crisis. However, on the other hand, none of the parties fighting for power and profit is willing to make major concessions. Thus, Gaillard, who is only thirty-eight years old and has little seniority, was brought out to temporarily maintain the situation.

It can be seen that the Gaillard cabinet is nothing more than a result of contradictions, a product of compromise, and its foundation is extremely unstable. It is not only not a symbol of any "broad unity," but precisely a sign that France's colonial difficulties cannot be overcome and internal contradictions cannot be resolved. Such a cabinet does not seem to have a better fate than its predecessors.

    盖伊阿内阁——“厌倦”的产物
    本报评论员
    11月5日，法国国民议会批准由激进社会党人、原布歇—莫努里内阁中的财政部长费利克斯·盖伊阿出任新总理。延续了五星期之久的法国政府危机总算暂时告一段落。
    布歇—莫努里内阁的垮台，是阿尔及利亚殖民战争的困难和财政危机使法国统治集团内部矛盾尖锐化的结果。在组织新阁的过程中，这种困难和矛盾得到了新的证明。法国总统戈蒂曾经先后邀请社会党领袖摩勒、民主社会抵抗联盟领袖普利文、保守派领袖比内和人民共和党领袖舒曼出来组阁；但是他们有的不敢应命，有的奔走了一番就知难而退，有的要求国民议会授权而结果碰了壁。因此，巴黎的政治观察家对这次政府危机的评论是一片不安的呼号。人们甚至传说，戈蒂总统由于对物色新总理人选感到绝望，已经准备要提出辞职了。
    就在这时候，盖伊阿居然上台了。在他的内阁名单里，包括了从社会党到保守派那些一直在激烈地争吵着的政党的成员。盖伊阿为此吹嘘说，他促使那些政党达成了“广泛的团结”。
    事情真是这样吗？答复当然是否定的。法国统治集团内部矛盾发展得如此尖锐，是由于法国在阿尔及利亚的殖民政策已经处于绝境，由于国内的财政状况已经十分严重。摩勒政府是因此倒台的，布歇—莫努里政府也是因此倒台的。而盖伊阿组阁的纲领，根本没有解决这两方面困难的任何新办法。
    关于阿尔及利亚问题，直接负责指导对阿尔及利亚人民的殖民军事镇压的拉戈斯特，留任阿尔及利亚驻节部长，这一事实就表明盖伊阿不过是承袭摩勒和布歇—莫努里的衣钵。而保守派同意参加内阁，更说明盖伊阿在这个问题上对北非殖民集团的妥协。
    由于在阿尔及利亚的军事形势愈来愈恶劣，法国的统治集团对于怎样维护法国在阿尔及利亚的殖民统治这个问题上意见有严重的分歧。一部分人认为，在军事镇压以外，还需要搞一些“改革”之类的政治花招才行。但是所谓保守派却反对任何即使是形式上的“改革”，而坚持加强军事镇压。原布歇—莫努里政府的所谓阿尔及利亚“根本法”草案，就是考虑到前一部分人所主张的那种意见，而又尽量照顾到后一部分人的要求，然后提交给国民议会讨论的。由于矛盾尖锐，“根本法”草案没有能通过，政府就倒了台。在这个问题上，盖伊阿已经表示，他仍然要制订一个和“根本法”类似的法律，要使前政府起草的特别权力法案“在其现有的形式下”提付表决。在关系到法国政治经济局面的这个当前关键的问题上，盖伊阿丝毫也没有使矛盾有所减少。
    至于财政经济问题，只要回顾一下盖伊阿在布歇—莫努里政府中直接掌握财政大权的几个月的政绩，就不难估计他这次纲领的价值了。盖伊阿在财政部长的任期中，曾经采取了所谓“紧急措施”，企图来改善财政情况。结果，法郎贬值了20％，对外贸易的逆差依旧增加，外汇储备完全枯竭；尽管税收一再增加，社会福利开支不断削减，然而国库还是空空如也，不得不继续向法兰西银行借款来维持。
    根本的问题是，法国的经济再也负担不起阿尔及利亚战争开支的重荷了。盖伊阿政府既然宣布它将继续在阿尔及利亚干下去，就不可能设想它能够找到任何有效的解决财政危机的办法。
    情况既然如此，那末盖伊阿竟能在一些老牌人物都组阁失败之后而轻易上台，又是什么原因呢？说来也不奇怪。早在盖伊阿刚刚被邀组阁时，“法新社”在一则新闻里转述了巴黎政治观察家们的预测：“由于议会极端厌倦了，这次盖伊阿可能成功。”用“厌倦”这个字眼，是掩饰了事情的实质的。把话说得明白一些是：法国统治集团认识到，长期没有一个政府的局面会对他们大家都不利。特别是在目前，联合国大会马上要讨论阿尔及利亚问题；阿尔及利亚民族解放军发动了大规模的进攻；国内财政情况十分紧急；工人运动正在蓬勃展开；国际局势有了新的重大发展，西方国家决定举行首脑会议作紧急磋商。……在这种情况下，有必要赶快结束这次政府危机。但是，另一方面，争权夺利的各方谁也不肯作较大的让步。于是，年方三十八岁、资望甚浅的盖伊阿就被捧出来暂时维持局面。
    由此可见，盖伊阿内阁不过是一个矛盾的结果，妥协的产物，它的基础是极其不稳的。它不但不是什么“广泛的团结”的象征，而恰恰是法国殖民主义困难无法克服、内部矛盾无法解决的标帜。这样的内阁，看来也不会比它的几个前任有较好的命运。
