Collect More, Collect Quickly Agricultural and Livestock Products - Don't Wait Any Longer!
By Our Commentator

    At present, it is the peak season for the marketing of agricultural and livestock products such as tobacco, hemp, wool, and hides. Purchasing departments in various regions should adhere to the principle of quick collection and increased collection, acquiring all the agricultural and livestock products that can be collected. To support national economic construction, increase farmers' income, and improve people's lives, this work should be done well.
    This year's agricultural and animal husbandry production is generally good. Taking hemp as an example, preliminary estimates indicate that ramie, jute, hemp, and green hemp will all increase by about 5% to 15% compared to last year. Although Shandong, Henan, and other provinces suffered disasters this year and reduced their production of flue-cured tobacco, Anhui, another major producing area, not only increased its production significantly but also improved its quality. Livestock products such as wool and hides have also seen annual increases in production due to the development of cooperatives and strong state support for animal husbandry. Since the State Council promulgated the "Regulations on Prohibiting Agricultural Products and Other Materials Subject to State Planned Purchase (Monopoly Purchase) and Unified Purchase from Entering the Free Market" in August this year, various regions have strengthened market management, blocked speculative activities, and relatively expanded the scope of procurement. After the great debate on the two roads in rural areas, the socialist consciousness of farmers in many areas has also been raised. These are all favorable conditions for doing a good job in the procurement of agricultural and livestock products this year.
    Of course, this does not mean that with these favorable conditions, we can sit back and relax. At present, although the purchase volume of flue-cured tobacco is gradually increasing, the progress is still slower than last year; although the purchase progress of hemp, wool, hides, etc. is faster than the same period last year, it is still far from this year's purchase plan. Now is the most crucial stage of the procurement work, and we should quickly check the reasons for the slow progress and immediately improve it.
    Generally speaking, the procurement personnel in various regions are working hard. However, individual procurement units still have passive waiting ideas. They want to wait until the farmers have finished debating and their socialist consciousness has been raised before starting procurement; or wait until the farmers have finished fighting drought before starting procurement.
    The ongoing great debate in rural areas does have a significant positive effect on helping farmers correctly handle the relationship between personal interests and national interests and on mobilizing farmers to sell more and retain less agricultural and livestock products. However, this only means that we should do the procurement work faster and better in this favorable situation. Why wait until the great debate is completely over to do the procurement work? Procurement staff should also not stand by and watch during the great debate; they should, in fact, combine it with the procurement work to help rural cadres better carry out the great debate so that farmers can receive socialist education through concrete work. In this way, those who have already received socialist education can further consolidate their existing understanding; and those who have not yet started the debate can both prepare for the great debate and sell agricultural and livestock products to the state. Some cadres and members of agricultural and pastoral cooperatives still cannot correctly understand and handle the relationship between the state, the collective, and the individual. Some members overuse hemp or hides, and some cooperatives also want to sell less and retain more for their own use or to engage in sideline occupations. This requires explaining to them that their needs in life and production should of course be appropriately taken care of; however, based on the spirit of diligence and thrift in running cooperatives, diligence and thrift in managing households, and supporting national economic construction, we should retain as little as possible of the agricultural and livestock products that must be retained; and not retain those that can be retained or not retained, so as to achieve selling first and retaining later, selling more and retaining less, and selling the good and retaining the inferior. It should also be made clear to them that processing hides and other products for sideline occupations is unfavorable from a global perspective. Currently, the quality of rural tanned hides is low and not durable due to limitations in technology and equipment, which causes waste. On the one hand, we should help cooperatives and members develop other appropriate sideline production; on the other hand, we should also lead members to launch debates to clarify what is ultimately beneficial to the country, the collective, and the members.
    In the previous period, some regions concentrated their efforts on fighting drought, which somewhat affected the work of agricultural cooperatives in selling agricultural products. However, the most intense stage of drought resistance has now basically ended. Even if agricultural cooperatives still need to continue to fight drought or are busy with other production activities, as long as labor is rationally arranged, it should not affect sales work. The Dongfanghong Agricultural Cooperative in Xuchang County, Henan, even when drought resistance was at its most intense, still set a plan to sell tobacco leaves, and extracted some semi-labor force to bundle tobacco, selling more than 8,000 jin of flue-cured tobacco in two days. This shows that as long as arrangements are reasonable, drought resistance and other agricultural activities do not contradict the sale of agricultural products.
    To collect more and faster tobacco, hemp, and other agricultural and livestock products, it is also necessary to improve procurement methods. Some procurement units must change their practice of not going deep into agricultural cooperatives but "sitting" and waiting. The result of "sitting" and waiting often leads to two situations: one is that they don't come. The other is that there is a lack of unified arrangements, and the selling households crowd together, making it difficult for the purchasing unit to cope and causing the selling households to delay production due to long waits. The latter phenomenon has recently occurred in some areas of Guizhou in the purchase of flue-cured tobacco. On the contrary, the Yuxian County Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Shanxi, in response to the situation where farmers were too busy to sell wool, organized teams to go to the countryside, carrying wool bags to collect wool door-to-door, collecting almost all the scattered wool that could be collected, and overfulfilling the task calmly. Of course, flue-cured tobacco is different from wool, and the specific methods of purchasing the two may differ; however, strengthening ties with agricultural cooperatives is indispensable in the procurement work of any agricultural and livestock products.
    Over the past few years, supply and marketing cooperatives have accumulated some procurement experience and strengthened their work in procurement organization and inspection technology. It is especially worth pointing out that in procurement work, many places, based on the principle of the mass line, have created and promoted resident liaison officers and democratic evaluation work involving members of agricultural cooperatives. This has greatly strengthened the connection between purchasing units and production units and promoted purchasing work. This mass line working method should be adhered to and widely implemented.
    In addition, market management work should continue to be strengthened.
    By doing these tasks well, we will definitely be able to procure more and better tobacco, hemp, wool, and hides and other agricultural and livestock products. Don't wait any longer, quickly increase our efforts in all aspects and take action!

    多收快收农畜产品
    不要再等待了！
    本报评论员
    目前正是烟、麻、羊毛、皮张等农畜产品上市的旺季。各地采购部门应该本着快收、多收的方针，把可能收到的农畜产品都收购上来。为了支援国家经济建设、增加农民收入和改善人民生活，都应该把这件工作做好。
    今年农牧业的生产情况一般良好。以麻类来说，初步预计苎麻、黄麻、大麻、青麻都比去年增产5％至15％左右。今年的烤烟，虽然山东、河南等省受灾有所减产，但是另一主要产区——安徽的烤烟不但增产很多，而且质量也好。毛、皮等畜产品，由于合作社的发展和国家对畜牧业的大力扶植，生产也在年年上升。自从今年8月国务院公布“关于由国家计划收购（统购）和统一收购的农产品和其他物资不准进入自由市场的规定”后，各地都加强了市场管理，堵死了投机活动，相对地扩大了收购范围。经过农村两条道路的大辩论，不少地区的农民的社会主义觉悟也提高了。这些，都是今年做好农畜产品收购工作的有利条件。
    当然，这决不是说，有了这些有利条件，就可以高枕无忧了。目前烤烟的收购量虽逐渐上升，但进度仍比去年迟缓；麻、羊毛、皮张等的收购进度虽然比去年同期快，但是与今年收购计划比，相差尚远。现在正是收购工作最要紧的阶段，应该赶快检查一下进度迟缓的原因，立即改进。
    一般说来，各地收购人员都是努力工作的。但是，个别地区的收购单位还存在着消极等待思想。他们想等待农民辩论完了，社会主义觉悟提高了再收购；或者等农民抗旱完了才收购。
    农村正在进行的大辩论，对于帮助农民正确处理个人利益与国家利益、对动员农民少留多卖农畜产品方面的确有很大的积极作用。但是，这只说明应该在这个有利的形势下把收购工作做得更快更好一些。何必等待大辩论完全结束了才做收购工作呢？收购工作人员也不应该在大辩论中站在袖手旁观的地位，正好应该结合收购工作，帮助农村干部把大辩论更好地开展起来，使农民通过具体的工作受到社会主义教育。这样，已经受到了社会主义教育的，就可以更加巩固他们已有的认识；还没有展开辩论的，也能够一方面为大辩论做好准备，一方面把农畜产品卖给国家。有些农业社牧业社的干部和社员，还不能正确地了解和处理国家、社和个人三者之间的关系。有的社员过多地分用了麻或皮张，有的合作社也想少卖多留些自己用或者搞副业。这就需要向他们解释：对于他们生活和生产上的需要，当然要适当照顾；但是，应该本着勤俭办社、勤俭持家和支援国家经济建设的精神，对必需要留用的农畜产品，尽量少留；对可留可不留的，就不留，做到先卖后留、多卖少留、卖好留次。还要使他们了解，用皮张等加工搞副业，从全局来说，是不利的。目前农村硝制的皮张，由于技术和设备的限制，质量低，不耐用，这就造成了浪费。一方面，应该帮助社里和社员开展其他适当的副业生产；一方面，还应该领导社员展开辩论，弄清楚究竟怎样才对国家对社对社员都有利。
    前一个时期，有些地区因为集中力量抗旱，使农业社出售农产品的工作多少受到一些影响。不过，抗旱的最紧张阶段现在已经基本结束，即使农业社还需继续抗旱或忙于其他生产活动，只要合理安排劳动力，还是可以不影响出售工作的。河南许昌县东方红农业社，正当抗旱最紧张的时候，还订了出售烟叶的计划，抽出一些半劳力来扎烟，在两天内就卖了八千多斤烤烟。这说明，只要合理安排，抗旱等农事活动同出售农产品并不矛盾。
    要多收和快收烟麻等农畜产品，还需要改进收购方法。有些收购单位不深入农业社而“坐点”等待的办法必须改变。“坐”等的结果，常常会产生两种情况：一种是等不来。一种是缺乏统一安排，出售的户头拥在一起，收购单位手忙脚乱无法应付，出售户则因久等贻误生产。后一种现象，最近贵州一些地区在收购烤烟中就曾出现过。相反，山西盂县供销社针对农忙无暇出售羊毛的情况，组织下乡小组，带着毛包上门收购，把能够收购到的零星分散的羊毛差不多都收了上来，从容不迫地超额完成了任务。当然，烤烟不同于羊毛，两者的收购具体方法容或有些差异；然而，加强同农业社的联系，在任何农畜产品的收购工作中都是不可忽视的。
    几年来，供销社已经积累了一些收购经验，加强了收购组织和验级技术等方面的工作。特别值得指出的是：在收购工作中，许多地方根据群众路线的原则，创造和推广了驻乡联络员和由农业社社员参加的民主评级工作。这样就大大地密切了收购单位同生产单位的联系，推进了收购工作。这种群众路线的工作方法应该坚持下来，普遍推行。
    此外，市场管理工作还要继续加强。
    做好了这些工作，就一定能够收购到更多、更好的烟、麻、羊毛和皮张等农畜产品。不要再等待了，快从多方面一齐加劲，行动起来吧！
