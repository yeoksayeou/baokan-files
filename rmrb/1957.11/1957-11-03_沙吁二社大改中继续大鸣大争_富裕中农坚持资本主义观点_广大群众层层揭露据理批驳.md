Guangzhou, November 2nd (From our Newspaper) Agricultural cooperatives, when undergoing a great transformation after experiencing great blooming, great contending, and great debate, must oppose purely technical viewpoints and continue to boldly promote democracy and implement the spirit of great blooming, great contending, and great debate. Only in this way can the victories achieved in the great debate be consolidated and expanded and be reflected in the various systems within the cooperative. Only systems formulated in this way can be supported by the broad masses of members and be actively implemented.

This is the conclusion drawn by the Sha Xu No. 2 Cooperative in Panyu County, Guangdong Province, in this movement.

This agricultural cooperative has a total of 258 households. For more than a year, it has been impacted by spontaneous capitalist forces. The wealthy middle peasants in the cooperative have desperately developed their private economies, raised a large number of private sows and flocks of ducks, and wholeheartedly schemed on their private plots, even to the point of renting out private plots. After about a month of great debate, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants sharpened their eyes and strengthened their determination to take the socialist road. The wealthy middle peasants were defeated in the debate, their spontaneous ideas were criticized, they admitted their mistakes, and began to work. As a result, the cooperative's production work showed a new atmosphere that had not been seen in a year. Then, based on the victory of the debate, the cooperative began to systematically improve its internal work, re-examined and revised the past poorly executed contracting system, and prepared to establish some systems that could reasonably handle the relationship between the cooperative's public and private interests, so as to formulate the 1958 production plan.

Initially, some cadres believed that these tasks could be accomplished by simply drawing a few people for ten days or so, just as they had rectified the cooperative in the past, to formulate all the system plans and then submit them to the members' congress for approval and implementation. Practice negated this purely technical viewpoint, and the same sharp, intense, and more complex two-road struggle emerged in the process of improvement. For example, when specifically handling the relationship between the cooperative's public and private interests, the broad masses of members, whose awareness had been raised, demanded the establishment of a cooperative-loving pledge to restrict those who "wear half-shoes" (referring to members who only cared about developing their personal economies and disregarded the cooperative's production). They put forward many specific measures, such as delineating the boundaries of household sideline occupations and setting a maximum number of ducks that each household could raise; setting the attendance task for each member, and deducting grain or even taking back private plots from those who did not complete the task without special circumstances; taking back over-allocated private plots and prohibiting renting; and not providing food rations to laborers who privately left the cooperative to work elsewhere. As soon as these opinions were raised, they aroused fierce opposition from those "engaging in spontaneity," the wealthy middle peasants. For example, wealthy middle peasants Chen Ze and Chen Jiang clamored aggressively, saying, "In the past, we were called upon to develop household sideline occupations, but now we are restricting them. Does the government have the final say?" "Why stipulate attendance days? Is this labor reform?" The argument that had been refuted, "Earn food rations by working, and rely on yourself to improve your life," reappeared in a disguised form. However, the poor and lower-middle peasants rose up to argue with reason and confidence, saying, "We work hard to grow grain and let you eat it to engage in spontaneous money-making. Is there anything so cheap and unreasonable in the world?" "Everyone is a member of the cooperative, and if we have the ability, everyone should do it. This is the natural order of things. In the past, it was 'live fish carrying dead fish.' How could production be done well?" When discussing the number of private ducks to be raised, people said, "Raising thirty or forty ducks requires one person to take care of them. Raising flocks of ducks privately will definitely affect attendance, and raising too many ducks wastes grain. Those who complain about not having enough grain are all those who are desperately raising ducks." The wealthy middle peasants, who had been aggressive, were at a loss for words.

After the leadership explained the policies and drew a clear line between legitimate household sideline occupations and spontaneous forces, a unanimously supported "cooperative-loving pledge" was finally formulated, making the handling of public and private relationships specific and plugging the loopholes of capitalism.

When discussing and studying how to better implement the mutual benefit policy to promote production and improve the contracting system, the wealthy middle peasants showed even more "step-by-step defense, every inch must be contested." They took the opportunity to smuggle in fake goods of "disguised individual farming." They initially proposed "contracting production to households," but this was quickly seen through and refuted by the poor and lower-middle peasants. Then, they proposed: "Since contracting production to households does not work, isn't 'free grouping, contracting production to small groups' even better?" The reason was: "Free grouping brings people together, production is good with discussion and consultation, and small groups are easy to lead, and the captain is easy to do." They also exaggerated the shortcomings of the past contracting system, saying, "Contracting production by team is not good, people's hearts are not aligned, there are many opinions, work does not take into account quality, and waste is great." These beautiful words did confuse many people, and there was a situation where only a few activists insisted on opposing it. However, when further blooming and contending were carried out, and the discussion reached how to organize and how to contract, their true colors were finally revealed. Wealthy middle peasant Zhuo Jun said: "Everyone finds like-minded people, and after the small group completes the contracted production task, they can think of more ways to increase income." Wealthy middle peasant Bingkun said: "After the small group contracts production, it is 'each temple has its own Bodhisattva, each uses its own methods.'" At this time, the poor and lower-middle peasants began to wake up, and they began to argue and oppose, saying: "Isn't this like the past mutual aid groups, where the strong are matched with the strong, the weak are matched with the weak, soldiers are matched with soldiers, generals are matched with generals, and poor peasants are squeezed everywhere?" "This method will definitely benefit a few people and not benefit most people." "This is not a way to improve production. People who engage in spontaneity come together and still want to engage in spontaneity. They will definitely not produce according to the needs of the state, and they will not accept the leadership of the cooperative committee. That is no different from disbanding the cooperative and farming individually." In this way, a new contracting plan was formulated to address the past shortcomings.

Similarly, when formulating the 1958 cooperative's production plan, a great debate was triggered on whether it was better to plant large rows (intercropping) or plowing (continuous cropping) in the paddy fields. This seemingly technical debate on farming was essentially a question of the two-road struggle related to the management policy of the agricultural cooperative, and whether the agricultural cooperative should undertake the state's grain production task.

In the debate, the members exposed that the reason why the wealthy middle peasants advocated planting large rows was not because large rows were really better than plowing and could increase grain production, but because this method of cultivation required less effort, and they could have more time to engage in their own sideline occupations and develop their personal economies. Then, should the agricultural cooperative focus on increasing grain production or spending more time on other businesses? Everyone calculated an account: In the two years since cooperativization, the total population of the cooperative has increased from 1,020 to 1,100, and the demand for food rations has increased from 561,000 jin to 600,000 jin. If we do not increase grain production, we will not have enough to eat ourselves. How can we support industrial construction? Then, can developing other crops without a plan necessarily make money? Everyone also made an analysis and negated this statement. As a result, the tricks played by the wealthy middle peasants on the production plan were also shattered again.

After this period of great debate in the improvement work, the wealthy middle peasants suffered a more thorough defeat, and the broad masses of members further clarified the boundaries and their awareness was further improved. At the same time, because these plans and systems were formulated through mass discussion, the systems and plans were more perfect and could be mastered by the broad masses of members and consciously and willingly implemented. The cadres had considered afterwards: Why were the various plans and systems formulated in each cooperative rectification in the past not easily implemented? For this question, the members had a sentence that could serve as a very good answer: "In the past, you cooked the dishes and let us eat them, of course, they didn't suit our taste!"

    沙吁二社大改中继续大鸣大争
    富裕中农坚持资本主义观点　广大群众层层揭露据理批驳
    本报广州2日电　农业社在经过大鸣大放大争，进入大改阶段的时候，必须反对单纯技术观点，继续放手发扬民主、贯彻大鸣大放大争的精神，才能使在大辩论时所取得的胜利继续巩固和扩大，并在社内各种制度上体现出来；而只有这样制订出来的制度，也才能为广大社员所拥护，并且积极执行。
    这是广东省番禺县沙吁二社在这次运动中得出的结论。
    这个农业社共二百五十八户。一年多来曾受到资本主义自发势力的冲击，社里的富裕中农曾拼命发展私人经济，大量饲养私人的母猪和群鸭，并全心全意在自留地上打算盘，甚至已经发生租佃自留地的现象。经过一个月左右的大辩论后，广大贫农和下中农擦亮了眼睛，坚定走社会主义道路的决心。富裕中农在辩论中失败了，自发思想受到批判，承认了错误，开始出勤。全社生产工作因而出现了一年来未有过的新气象。接着，该社就在辩论胜利的基础上开始系统地改进社内工作，对过去没有做好的包工制度从新研究改订方案，准备订立一些能合理地处理社内公私关系的制度，以便订出1958年的生产计划等。
    对于这些工作，初时曾有些干部认为：只要像过去整社一样，抽几个人花上十天八天就可把一切制度方案订出，然后提交社员大会通过执行。实践否定了这种单纯技术观点的看法，改进工作过程中出现了同样尖锐激烈而且更加复杂的两条道路的斗争。比如，在具体处理社内公私关系时，提高了觉悟的广大社员要求订一个爱社公约，对那些“穿半截鞋”（指只顾发展个人经济不顾社的生产的社员）的人加以限制。他们纷纷提出许多具体措施，如家庭副业要划定界限，订出每户养鸭最高数目；定出每个社员的出勤任务，凡无特殊情况，完不成任务的扣减粮食，甚至收回自留地；多分的自留地也要收回，禁止租佃；劳力私自外流不在社出勤的，社里不发口粮。这些意见一提出来，就引起那些“搞自发”的富裕中农激烈的反对。如富裕中农陈泽、陈江声势汹汹地叫嚷说：“以前号召发展家庭副业，现在又来限制，究竟政府说话算不算数？”“为什么规定出勤天数，这是劳改吗？”领导上认为这是使斗争取得更彻底的胜利的时机，如果过去还未放透争透，现在就是放透争透的机会。于是，又一次大放大鸣大争就展开了。
    出勤任务成为争论的焦点。耕了一亩多自留地、长期不出勤的富裕中农朱锦说：“定了出勤任务，我的自留地要丢荒了，岂不是破坏生产？”陈树江说：“既然是按劳取酬，我做得少就得少些，何必这样限制死人。”曾经被驳斥的“出勤赚口粮，改善生活靠自己”的论调又改装变相出现了。但是，贫、下中农理直气壮地起来辩驳，说：“我们辛辛苦苦种粮食，让你们吃了去搞自发赚钱，天下有这样便宜这样不合理的事？”“大家都是社员，有功夫应该大家做，这是天公地道的事情，过去那样子，是‘生鱼带死鱼’，生产怎能搞好？”讨论私人养鸭数目时，人们说：“每养三四十只鸭，就得一个人服侍，私人养群鸭，一定影响出勤，而且养鸭太多，浪费粮食，叫喊粮食不够的，都是拼命养鸭的人。”原来气势汹汹的富裕中农都理屈辞穷了。
    经过领导上交代政策，划清正当家庭副业同自发势力的界线以后，终于订出了一个一致拥护的“爱社公约”，使公私关系的处理具体化了，堵塞了资本主义的漏洞。
    在讨论研究怎样更好地贯彻互利政策促进生产改进包工制度时，富裕中农更是表现得“步步为营，寸土必争”，他们又乘机偷运“变相单干”的假货。他们最初提出“包产到户”的主张，但很快就被贫、下中农识穿和驳倒了。接着，他们又提出：“既然以户包产行不通，那么，‘自由合组、小组包产’不是更好吗？”理由是：“自由组合人心齐，有商有量生产搞得好，而且组小易领导，队长也好做。”他们又夸大过去在包工制度上的缺点，说：“以队包产搞不好，人心不齐意见多，工作不顾质量，浪费大。”这些漂亮的言词的确迷惑了许多人，曾出现只有少数积极分子坚持反对的局面。但是，当进一步鸣放下去，讨论到如何编组如何包法时，他们的底子就终于露出来了。富裕中农灼均说：“大家各找合心人，小组完成包产任务后，就可多想门路增加收入。”富裕中农炳坤说：“小组包产后，正是‘各庙各菩萨，各施各法’。”这时，贫、下中农开始醒悟了，他们开始争辩反对了，说：“这岂不像过去互助组时那样，强对强，弱对弱，兵对兵，将对将，贫苦农民到处受排挤？”“这办法一定会少数人好，多数人不好。”“这不是为了搞好生产的办法，走自发的人合在一起，还是想搞自发，他们一定不按国家需要生产，不接受社委会领导，那跟散社单干没有两样。”这样，才针对过去的缺点，制定出新的包工方案来。
    同样，在制定1958年全社生产计划时，也在稻田莳大行（间作）好还是翻耕（连作）好的问题上，触发了大辩论。这个看来是耕作技术上的争论，实质上却是一个联系到农业社经营方针上两条道路斗争的问题，是农业社同国家关系，农业社是否承担国家粮食生产任务的问题。
    在争辩中，社员们揭穿了富裕中农之所以主张莳大行，不是因为大行真的胜过翻耕，可以增产粮食，而是因为这样耕作方法花功夫少，他们可以有更多的时间去搞自己的副业和发展个人经济。那么，农业社应以增产粮食为主还是以更多时间经营其他？大家算了一笔账：合作化两年来，全社人口从一千零二十人增加到一千一百人，口粮需要从五十六万一千斤增加到六十万斤，如果不增产粮食，自己也不够吃，怎能支援工业建设？那么，无计划地发展其他作物，是否一定能赚钱呢？大家也作了分析，并且否定了这一说法。于是，富裕中农在生产计划上玩弄的手法也又破灭了。
    经过这一段改进工作中的大辩论，富裕中农遭到了更彻底的失败，广大社员则进一步划清了界限，觉悟进一步提高了。同时，由于这些计划和制度是经过群众讨论制定的，因而使制度计划更加完善，也能为广大社员所掌握，自觉地乐意地执行。干部们曾在事后考虑过：为什么过去每次整社，每次制定的各种计划制度都不容易贯彻下去呢？对于这个问题，社员有一句话可以作为很好的回答：“过去是你们炒了菜让我们吃，当然不合口胃了！”　　（周方旸　黄向青）
