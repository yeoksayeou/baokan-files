    The Soviet Republics
    Prosperous Georgia
    Georgia is an ancient country in the South Caucasus Mountains. Immortal masterpieces of world literature such as "The Knight in the Panther's Skin," and the works of the great Russian poets Pushkin and Lermontov, vividly depict Georgia's ancient culture and beautiful land. However, despite its beauty and antiquity, in the era of Tsarist Russia, it was a backward frontier, a semi-feudal agricultural region with only about two hundred small handicraft enterprises and nothing else.
    Now, Georgia has become a prosperous industrial and agricultural republic. In 1956, the republic's total industrial output increased thirtyfold compared to 1913, electricity increased two hundredfold, and coal increased more than fortyfold. The huge South Caucasus Steel Plant was built not far from Tbilisi. Manganese mining has also greatly developed, and its current output exceeds the total output of seven countries including the United States, Japan, Mexico, Congo, Morocco, the Union of South Africa, and Ghana. The machinery manufacturing and lathe manufacturing industries have also been established.
    Georgia's Black Sea coast has a humid subtropical climate. Therefore, it abounds in tea and fruits. The slopes in this area are covered with orange and tea plantations. The oranges, lemons, and other fruits it produces are not only supplied to Moscow and other large cities but also made into canned goods and shipped to various places. Therefore, Georgia's canned food, tea processing, dried fruit, and other enterprises are very developed. This year, Georgia will collect 125,000 tons of tea, which is more than 224 times that of 1913. The output of tangerines and grapes has also far exceeded pre-revolutionary levels. Due to the abundance of grapes, Georgia's wine is also one of its largest export items, not only supplying the entire Soviet Union but also selling abroad.
    Georgia's rich and diverse ancient national culture has only achieved true revival and development in the era of Soviet power. Now, the number of people with higher education per thousand Georgians is ten times that of Turkey, fifty times that of Iran, and four times that of the United Kingdom. There are more than 4,500 primary and secondary schools. In addition, Georgia has 130 scientific research institutions.
    The capital of the republic, Tbilisi, is a very ancient city and a historically vital passage from Europe to Asia. Before the October Revolution, the Tsarist Russian Governor-General of the Caucasus was stationed here. At that time, Tbilisi was a city of officials and small merchants, with more police and soldiers than workers. Now, it has become the second largest city in the South Caucasus, with a population of over 600,000, and is the industrial and cultural center of the republic. (Jun) (with picture)

    苏联的加盟共和国
    富饶的格鲁吉亚
    格鲁吉亚是南高加索山区的一个古老的国家。不朽的世界文学名著“虎皮骑士”，俄国大诗人普希金和莱蒙托夫的著作，都形象地描写了格鲁吉亚的古老文化和优美的国土。但是，尽管它美丽而古老，在帝俄时代它却是个落后的边疆，是半封建的农业区，除了二百来家小型的手工业企业外，就一无所有了。
    现在，格鲁吉亚已经成为一个繁荣的工农业共和国了。1956年，共和国的工业总产量已增加为1913年的三十倍，电力增加到二百倍，煤增加到四十倍以上。在距第比利斯不远的地方，建起了巨大的南高加索钢铁厂。锰矿开采业也得到很大发展，目前产量已超过了美国、日本、墨西哥、刚果、摩洛哥、南非联邦和加纳等七个国家的产量总和。机器制造业和车床制造业也都建立起来了。
    格鲁吉亚的黑海沿岸是湿润的亚热带气候。所以这儿盛产茶叶和水果。这一带的山坡上到处是橘园和茶园。它生产的橘子、柠檬等水果除供应莫斯科和其他大城市外，还制成罐头运往各地。所以格鲁吉亚的罐头食品、茶叶加工、干果等企业都很发达。今年格鲁吉亚采集的茶叶将达十二万五千吨，比1913年多二百二十四倍以上。橘柑和葡萄的产量也都远远超过了革命前的水平。由于盛产葡萄，所以格鲁吉亚的葡萄酒也是它出口的最大项目之一，不仅供应全苏联，而且还销行国外。
    格鲁吉亚那丰富多采的古老的民族文化，只有在苏维埃政权年代，才获得了真正的复兴和发展。现在，每一千个格鲁吉亚人中，受过高等教育的人数，为土耳其的十倍，为伊朗的五十倍，为英国的四倍。中小学校已有四千五百多所。此外，格鲁吉亚还有一百三十个科学研究机构。
    共和国首都第比利斯是个非常古老的城市，是历史上从欧洲到亚洲的必经之地。十月革命前，沙皇俄国的高加索总督就驻在这里。那时的第比利斯是个官吏和小商人的城市，警察和军人比工人还多。现在，它已成为南高加索第二个大城市，拥有六十多万人口，是共和国的工业和文化中心。　　　　（君）（附图片）
