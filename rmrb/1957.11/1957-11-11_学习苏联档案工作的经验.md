Learning from the Soviet Union's Experience in Archival Work
Zeng San

The great October Socialist Revolution and the Soviet Union's socialist construction have influenced China's revolution and socialist construction in all aspects, meticulously; its experience is extremely valuable to us. As an archival worker, I deeply feel, looking back at the development of my country's archival work over the past eight years, that the Soviet Union's advanced experience in archival undertakings, like other aspects, has played a very important role for us; the assistance of Soviet archival experts to us is truly brotherly and selfless. On the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution, I would like to make a few simple introductions with boundless gratitude to Soviet comrades.

Although our country's archival work has a history of more than three thousand years, the political and cultural organs of China before liberation did not have rich scientific knowledge of managing archives. Various organs had some methods for organizing and consulting documents, but the state did not have a complete and unified system for managing national archives. Although our Party had long paid attention to preserving archives, and the Party Central Committee formulated "Measures for Handling Documents" in Shanghai in 1931, we did a lot of work over the past twenty years, but before the national revolution's victory, we were in an underground and wartime environment, and it was impossible to preserve many archives. We did not accumulate much experience in this regard.

In this situation, in the first year of national liberation, Soviet archival expert Comrade Milyushin came to China. He visited archival work in our country, gave lectures, drafted documents, and worked diligently for more than half a year, which gave us a comprehensive understanding of archives and archival work: archives are not only the property of organs, but also the property of the state, and they play an extremely important role in socialist construction; archival work should not only be the work carried out by each organ, but should also be the unified work of the state; the habit of handling and keeping archives in a decentralized manner must be changed, and the principle of centralized and unified management of archives must be established. The dissemination of these ideas, coupled with his many suggestions, helped our document and archive workers improve their understanding and begin to value and study their work, laying a preliminary ideological foundation for the archival undertakings of socialist countries.

Comrade Milyushin's time in our country was not long, and our own experience was very little, so our initial learning was still superficial. In 1952, we established an archival training class at Renmin University, and invited Comrade Seleznev, who worked in our country for three years, to give a comprehensive and systematic introduction to the advanced experience of Soviet archival work. He helped us write three basic textbooks, helped us train teachers and graduate students, and also urged us to organize and study our own archival history. As a result, the archival training class of Renmin University was expanded into the Department of Historical Archives, and there were archival workers who had received basic training all over the country, which laid the foundation for our country's archival work in education and cadre training. After the National Archival Work Conference was held and the State Archives Bureau was established, our country's archival work developed vigorously.

In 1956, the State Archives Bureau hired Comrade Volchkov as a consultant. He made nineteen reports on the construction of our country's archives work and archival management institutions, and drafted seventeen business guidance documents, including draft versions of the National Archives Regulations, Archives and Documents Retention Schedule, Measures for Utilizing National Archival Materials, and Appraisal and Destruction Measures, which are all things we urgently need in carrying out our work. We are studying them based on China's actual experience, in order to gradually adopt and implement them.

In addition, many departments of the Central Government have hired Soviet experts to help them establish various special archival work and technical information work.

Over the past seven years, the books on Soviet archival work written and introduced to us by Soviet comrades, which we have translated and published (including internal distribution), have amounted to ten types, totaling 311,000 copies, some of which have been printed in four editions. The Soviet General Administration of Archives and the Soviet Historical Archives Institute also regularly donated some valuable materials to the State Archives Bureau and the Department of Historical Archives of Renmin University. In 1957 alone, the State Archives Bureau received as many as 45 types. In short, Soviet comrades have always responded to our requests for help, and this assistance has accelerated the development of archival work in our country, avoided detours, and has immeasurable value.

Chairman Mao said: "We must earnestly learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union has been building socialism for forty years, and its experience is extremely valuable to us." The results of our archival workers doing this have also fully proven this point. Although we have not learned very well in the past eight years, we have indeed achieved great results in the following aspects.

First of all, we have established the principle of unified management of national archives. The State Council's decision on strengthening national archival work stipulates: "All national archives... are the historical wealth of our country. The task of archival work is to establish a national archives system under the principle of unified management of national archives, and scientifically manage these archives, so as to facilitate the use of state organs' work and scientific research work." This idea did not exist in old China. At that time, the archival management system of various organs only focused on the convenience of retrieving and consulting archives within the organ. Scholars looked for archives, and most of them only focused on their own needs. The idea of comprehensively building the archival undertaking from the national long-term perspective was only the hope of a few people; but today this hope has been realized.

In several years of practical work, national archival personnel have seen that not only the archival materials of their own organs often need to be retrieved and consulted, but also the archival materials of the old regime organs often play an important role in our work. Because of these experiences, we all know that the archival materials of any organ must be selected and arranged into files according to their different values ​​and different retention periods. Those that should be permanently preserved must be sent to the National Archives on schedule. At the same time, we also know that all historical archival materials cannot be destroyed casually, but must be concentrated in the National Archives for careful cleaning and scientific arrangement, so as to facilitate research and utilization. Premier Zhou pointed out in the "Report on the Issue of Intellectuals": "In order to realize the plan of marching towards science, we must prepare all the necessary conditions for the development of scientific research. The most important thing here is to enable scientists to obtain the necessary books, archival materials, technical materials and other working conditions." This more clearly affirms the significance of archival work. At present, the national archival work has begun to move a big step towards this goal. The archival systems and document systems of various levels of organs have been established or are being established; historical archives have begun to be collected; the National Archives is under construction; and the archives of many provinces, cities, and autonomous regions are also being actively prepared. Of course, to manage the national archives in a unified way, so that they can be properly placed and facilitate the timely and long-term use of all parties, this work is very complicated. In addition to our continued efforts, we also need assistance from all parties.

Secondly, we have learned and are promoting a set of advanced experiences of Soviet archival work. Before liberation, the methods of arranging archives in our country were very inconsistent. The most commonly used arrangement methods at that time were the "Gate, Category, Outline, Item" method and the "Decimal Method." These methods are only suitable for the arrangement and classification of books, and it is unscientific to use them to arrange archives. There were also many organs that simply packed them into small bags by month and large bags by year without arranging them. This inconsistent, unscientific method or the habit of not arranging them has already made it difficult for various organs to find and consult archives themselves, and it is very unfavorable for unified management and finally concentrating and utilizing archives in the National Archives. The Soviet method is to take the fonds (all the archives of an organ) as a unit, and establish files and archive them according to the inherent relationship of years, issues, and organizational structures. File establishment is regarded as the last process of document work and is carried out by the document department; the archives rooms of various organs should focus on the work of preservation and organization of utilization and prepare to transfer the archives that have been cleared and identified to the National Archives on schedule; the Archives is completely a scientific research organ or an organ used by scientific researchers to use archives. This method is convenient for organs to find and consult, and also facilitates concentration in the National Archives. This is a method of managing archives according to the natural laws of forming archival materials, and it is the most scientific method. Since we learned the theory and practice of Soviet archival work in 1952, it has been implemented nationwide so far. Thanks to the State Council's decision on strengthening national archival work and some measures and general rules approved and issued by the State Council, these methods have become the national organs' system, so the promotion effect is very fast. However, because our foundation is too weak and the time is still short, and the work of the Archives is still in the preparatory stage, the work done in preservation and research utilization is still small and needs further efforts.

Third, we already have a set of archival institutions and a group of archival work cadres. This set of organizations includes the archives rooms of various organs, the National Archives, archival business management institutions, and archival education institutions. The organ archives room is an institution for centralized management of the archives of the organ, and it is a part of the organ organization, but it is the basic institution for the national management of archives. Most organs have established this institution, and a few that have not established it should also establish it. The central or local National Archives is an institution that concentrates and manages national archives by region and type, and it is the central institution of the archival undertaking. It provides conditions for scientific research work to provide archival materials, and the central task is to be undertaken by them. We already have the First Historical Archives, the Nanjing Historical Data Compilation and Arrangement Office, and the Archives Preparation Offices in Shanghai, Wuhan, Chongqing, Shenyang, and Xi'an. In addition to the State Archives Bureau, there are also archival management offices (sections) in various provinces, cities, and autonomous regions, and some central organs also have archival bureaus (offices, sections). In order to organize and supervise the national archives file establishment system and the concentration, arrangement, preservation, and utilization of archives, such institutions are indispensable. In the past, we did not pay enough attention to this, and the phenomenon of archives being lost and damaged has been repeatedly seen. We should strengthen supervision and inspection in this area in the future. At present, there are only the Department of Historical Archives of Renmin University and some training classes. In the Department of Historical Archives, research is being conducted on the theory and practice of archival work, document science, preservation technology, technical archives, literature publication science, Chinese archival history, and foreign archival history, and textbooks are being compiled, which is laying the foundation for the research of archival science in our country. In addition, there is also the "Archival Work" magazine, which has also played a significant role in training and uniting archival work cadres.

With the development of national archival work and the establishment of the archival system, the task of training cadres has been put forward. Since 1952, nearly 500 cadres have studied at the Archival Training Department of Renmin University, thousands of people have studied in training classes in various places, and even more have studied on their own through documents and books. Judging from the distribution of more than 60,000 copies of "Archival Work," there must be more than 60,000 cadres engaged in archival work nationwide. It cannot be said that it is a huge achievement that such a large group of cadres has mastered or is learning the advanced experience of Soviet archival work. Strengthening the dedication of these comrades, continuing to improve their professional ability and scientific knowledge level, the future of our country's archival work is unlimited.

In short, the development of our country's archival undertaking in the past few years has been very rapid. Although there are still many shortcomings to be overcome and many problems that have not been resolved, we have indeed made great achievements with the help of Soviet comrades. When I look back at the development of archival work in the past few years and see these achievements, we are very grateful for the help of Soviet comrades. We must better learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, combine it with China's reality, correctly apply and promote it, improve the ideological level and professional level of cadres, solve problems, overcome shortcomings, and make our country's archival undertaking fully adapt to the needs of socialist construction.

    学习苏联档案工作的经验
    曾三
    伟大的十月社会主义革命，和苏联的社会主义建设，对于中国革命和中国社会主义建设的影响，是各方面的、无微不至的；其经验对于我们是十分宝贵的。我以一个档案工作者的身份，回顾一下八年来我国档案工作的发展，就深深感到，苏联在档案事业方面的先进经验，同其他方面一样，对我们起了非常重要的作用；苏联档案专家对我们的帮助也是真正兄弟般的、无私的帮助。现值十月革命四十周年，我抱着对苏联同志无限的感谢心情，想来做几点简单的介绍。
    我们国家的档案工作，虽然有了三千余年的历史，但是解放前中国的政权机关和文化机关对于管理档案的科学知识是不丰富的，各个机关对于整理和调阅文卷还有一些办法，而国家对于管理全国档案的完整和统一的制度却是没有的。我党虽然早已注意保存档案，1931年党中央在上海就制订了“文书处置办法”，二十年来做了很多工作，但是在全国革命胜利以前我们处在地下和战争的环境，要保存很多档案是不可能的，在这方面积累的经验也是不多的。
    在这种情况下，全国解放的第一年，苏联档案专家米留申同志到中国来了。他在我国参观档案工作，讲演，起草文件，辛勤地工作了半年多，使我们对档案和档案工作有了全面的认识：档案不仅是机关的财产，而且是国家的财产，它在社会主义建设中有极为重要的作用；档案工作不应该只是机关各自进行的工作，而应该同时是国家统一进行的工作；分散地处理和保管档案的习惯必须改变，集中地统一地管理档案的原则，必须确立。他传播的这些思想，加上他的许多建议，帮助我们文书档案人员提高了认识，开始重视和钻研自己的工作，为社会主义国家的档案事业打下了初步的思想基础。
    米留申同志在我国的时间不久，我们自己的经验又很少，所以我们初期的学习还是肤浅的。1952年，我们在人民大学创立档案专修班，聘来了谢列兹聂夫同志，他在我国工作了三年，把苏联档案工作的先进经验作了全面的系统的介绍，他帮助我们写了三种基本教材，帮助我们培养了教员和研究生，还督促我们对本国档案史进行了整理和研究。这样作的结果，人大的档案专修班扩大成了历史档案系，全国各地都有了经过基本训练的档案工作人员，就使我国档案工作在教育和培养干部方面打下了基础，在全国档案工作会议召开和国家档案局成立以后，我国的档案工作就有了蓬勃的发展。
    1956年，国家档案局又聘请了沃尔钦科夫同志为顾问，他对我国档案馆工作和档案事业管理机构的建设方面作了十九次报告，起草了十七个业务指导文件，包括国家档案条例、档案文件保管期限表、国家档案资料利用办法、鉴定和销毁办法等草案，都是我们在开展工作时非常需要的东西，我们正在根据中国的实际经验进行研究，以便陆续采择施行。
    此外，中央还有许多部门聘请了苏联专家帮助他们建立各种特殊的档案工作和技术资料工作。
    七年来苏联同志给我们写的和介绍的论述苏联档案工作的书籍，经我们翻译出版的（连内部发行的在内）已有十种，共三十一万一千册，其中有的印了四版。苏联档案管理总局和苏联历史档案学院还经常赠给国家档案局和人大历史档案系一些宝贵的材料，单就1957年国家档案局收到的就有四十五种之多。总之，苏联同志对我国的帮助是有求必应的，这些帮助对于我国档案工作的发展，增加了速度，少走了弯路，有不可估量的价值。
    毛主席说：“我们必须认真学习苏联的先进经验。苏联建设社会主义已经有四十年了，它的经验对于我们是十分宝贵的。”我们档案工作者这样作的结果，也完全证明了这一点。我们八年来虽然学习得还很不好，但是在以下几个方面确已取得了巨大的成绩。
    首先是我们已经确立了统一管理国家档案的原则。国务院关于加强国家档案工作的决定上规定：“国家的全部档案，……都是我们国家的历史财富。档案工作的任务就是要在统一管理国家档案的原则下建立国家档案制度，科学地管理这些档案，以便于国家机关工作和科学研究工作的利用。”这一个思想，在旧中国是没有的，那时候各机关档案的管理制度，只是从本机关调阅、查找的便利着眼，学者们寻找档案，也大多只是从本人的需要着眼，以国家的长远的观点来全面建设档案事业的思想还只是少数人的希望；但是在今天这个希望已经实现了。
    全国档案人员在几年的实际工作中已经看到，不仅本机关的档案材料经常需要查找、调阅，旧政权机关的档案材料对我们的工作也经常起着重要的作用。由于这一些经验，我们都已经知道，任何机关的档案材料，都必须经过选择根据它的不同价值，按不同的保管期限整理归档，应该永久保存的还要按期送入国家档案馆。同时我们也知道，一切历史档案材料都不能随便销毁，必须集中到国家档案馆经过认真的清理和科学的整理，以便研究和利用。周总理在“关于知识分子问题的报告”上指出：“为了实现向科学进军的计划，我们必须为发展科学研究准备一切必要的条件。在这里，具有首要意义的是要使科学家得到必要的图书、档案资料、技术资料和其他工作条件。”这便更明确地肯定了档案工作的意义。目前，全国的档案工作已开始朝着这个目标前进了一大步。各级机关的档案制度和资料制度已经建立或者正在建立；历史档案已经开始收集；国家档案馆正在修建；不少省、市、自治区的档案馆也已经在积极筹备中。自然，要把全国的档案统一地管理起来，使它们各得其所，便于各方面的随时的又长远的利用，这一工作是很复杂的，除了我们继续努力以外，还需要各方面给以帮助。
    其次，就是我们已经学到了而且正在推行着苏联档案工作的一套先进经验。在解放以前，我国档案的整理方法是很不统一的。当时采用得最普遍的整理方法是“门、类、纲、目”法和“十进法”，这些方法只适用于图书的整理分类，拿来整理档案是不科学的，还有不少的机关只是按月一小包、每年一大包，没有进行整理。这种不统一、不科学的办法或不加整理的习惯，对于各机关自己查找和调阅档案，已经困难不小，而对于统一管理和最后在国家档案馆集中和利用档案，则是非常不利的。苏联的方法，是以全宗（一个机关的全部档案）为单位，按年代、问题、组织机构等内在联系立卷归档，并把立卷当成文书工作的最后一个工序，由文书部门进行；各机关的档案室应着重保管和组织利用的工作并准备把经过清理鉴定的档案按期移交国家档案馆；档案馆则完全是一个科学研究机关或者是科学研究人员利用档案的机关。这种方法既便于机关查找和调阅，也便于向国家档案馆集中，这是按形成档案材料的自然规律管理档案的方法，是最科学的方法。自从1952年我们学习了苏联档案工作的理论与实践以后，到目前为止，就已经在全国实行开了，由于有了国务院关于加强国家档案工作的决定和国务院批准发布的一些办法和通则，又使这些方法成了国家机关的制度，所以推行的效果是很快的，不过由于我们的基础太薄，时间还短，档案馆的工作还只在筹备期间，所以在保管和研究利用方面做的工作还少，需要进一步地努力。
    第三、我们已经有了一套档案机构和一批档案工作的干部。这一套组织就是各机关的档案室、国家档案馆、档案业务管理机构、和档案教育机构。机关档案室是集中管理本机关档案的机构，是机关组织的一部分，但是它是国家管理档案的基础机构。大多数机关都已经建立了这一机构，少数没有建立的也应该建立起来。中央的或地方的国家档案馆是分地区、分种类集中管理全国档案的机构，是档案事业的中心机构，为科学研究工作提供档案资料的条件，中心的任务是由它们来担负的。我们已经有了第一历史档案馆、南京史料整理处和上海、武汉、重庆、沈阳、西安的档案馆筹备处等。档案业务管理机构，除国家档案局外，各省、市、自治区还有档案管理处（科），各中央机关也有设档案局（处、科）的。为了组织和监督全国档案的立卷归档制度和集中、整理、保管和利用等工作，这样的机构是不可少的。过去我们对此注意不够，散失损坏档案的现象已经屡见不鲜，今后应该加强这方面的监督和检查。档案教育机构，在目前还只有人民大学历史档案系和一些训练班，在历史档案系，已经就档案工作的理论与实践、文书学、保管技术学、技术档案、文献公布学、中国档案史、外国档案史等科目进行研究，编写教材，正为我国档案科学的研究建立基础。此外，还有“档案工作”杂志，它在培养和团结档案工作干部方面，也起了不小的作用。
    随着全国档案工作的开展和档案制度的建立，提出了训练干部的任务。自1952年以来，经过人民大学档案专修科学习的干部近五百人，在各地训练班学习过的数千人，经过文件和书刊自学的就更多了。从“档案工作”发行六万余份估计，全国从事档案工作的干部，当在六万人以上。这样一大批干部掌握了或者学习着苏联档案工作的先进经验，不能不说是一个巨大的成绩。加强这些同志的事业心，继续提高他们的业务能力和科学知识水平，我国档案工作的前途是未可限量的。
    总之，我国档案事业这几年来的发展是非常迅速的，尽管还存在着很多缺点有待克服，还有很多问题尚未解决，我们在苏联同志帮助之下，确已取得了很大的成绩。当我回顾这几年档案工作的发展，看到这些成绩的时候，我们对苏联同志的帮助，是十分铭感的。我们一定要更好地学习苏联的先进经验，联系我国实际，正确地运用和推广它们，提高干部的思想水平和业务水平，解决问题，克服缺点，使我国档案事业完全适应社会主义建设的需要。
