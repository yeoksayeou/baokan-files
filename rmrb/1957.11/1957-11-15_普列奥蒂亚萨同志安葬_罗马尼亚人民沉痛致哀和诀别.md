Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, November 14th: The Romanian working people on the 13th mourned and bid a final farewell to Comrade Preoteasa, alternate member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party and Secretary of the Central Committee.

After Comrade Preoteasa's coffin was transported back from the Soviet Union to Bucharest on the morning of the 12th, it was placed in the Palace of the Republic. For the past two days, crowds of working people have been streaming into the Palace of the Republic to pay their respects and bid farewell to Comrade Preoteasa's remains.

Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party, Groza, Chairman of the Presidium of the Grand National Assembly, other party and government leaders, and members of the Soviet government delegation attended the vigil.

At exactly 11:00 AM on the 13th, Romanian party and government leaders carried the coffin out of the hall of the Palace of the Republic and placed it on a gun carriage. The funeral procession proceeded towards the Ghencea Military Cemetery.

The funeral was held in the military cemetery. Apostol, member of the Political Bureau of the Workers' Party, delivered a eulogy. He spoke of the circumstances of Comrade Preoteasa's death and his contributions to the revolutionary cause.

Apostol said that before liberation, Preoteasa, as a brilliant political commentator, wrote many articles in the secret and public publications of the Communist Party and the Communist Youth League, calling on the working masses, youth, and all honest patriots to rise up and fight for democracy, for defending national independence, and for pursuing a policy of good neighborly and friendly relations with the Soviet Union. The exploiting classes arrested, sentenced, and imprisoned him in concentration camps more than once, but these could not frustrate his revolutionary will. After the liberation of Romania, Preoteasa made valuable contributions to the development of cultural undertakings and the implementation of the party and government's foreign policy.

Subsequently, Brezhnev, member of the Presidium of the CPSU Central Committee and Secretary of the CPSU Central Committee, spoke. Also speaking at the funeral were Romanian Deputy Foreign Minister Maioreanu and heads of mass organizations. After the speeches concluded, Comrade Preoteasa's coffin was slowly placed in the tomb to the sound of gun salutes and the Internationale.

    普列奥蒂亚萨同志安葬
    罗马尼亚人民沉痛致哀和诀别
    新华社布加勒斯特14日电　罗马尼亚劳动人民13日沉痛地和罗马尼亚工人党中央委员会政治局候补委员、中央委员会书记普列奥蒂亚萨同志最后告别。
    普列奥蒂亚萨同志的灵柩在12日清晨从苏联运回布加勒斯特以后，就停放在共和国宫内。这两天来，成群的劳动人民川流不息地走进共和国宫，向普列奥蒂亚萨遗体致哀和告别。
    罗马尼亚工人党中央第一书记乔治乌—德治、大国民议会主席团主席格罗查，以及其他党政领导人和苏联政府代表团的成员先后参加了守灵。
    13日上午十一时整，罗马尼亚党政领导人把灵柩抬出共和国宫大厅，安放在炮架上。送葬的行列向根恰军人陵园进发。
    在军人陵园里举行了葬礼。工人党中央政治局委员阿波斯托尔致悼词。他谈到普列奥蒂亚萨同志的逝世经过和他对革命事业的贡献。
    阿波斯托尔说，解放以前，普列奥蒂亚萨作为一个天才的政论家，在共产党和共产主义青年团的秘密和公开的刊物上写了许多文章，号召劳动群众、青年和一切正直的爱国人士起来为争取民主、为捍卫国家独立、为奉行同苏联建立睦邻和友好关系的政策而斗争，剥削阶级不止一次对他进行逮捕、判刑和把他关进集中营，但这些并不能挫折他的革命意志。在罗马尼亚解放以后，普列奥蒂亚萨在发展文化事业和实现党和政府的对外政策上作出了宝贵的贡献。
    随后，苏共中央主席团委员、苏共中央书记勃列日涅夫讲了话。在葬礼上讲话的还有罗马尼亚外交部副部长迈尔奈沙努和群众团体的负责人等。讲话结束以后，普列奥蒂亚萨同志的灵柩在礼炮和国际歌声中徐徐安放在墓穴中。
