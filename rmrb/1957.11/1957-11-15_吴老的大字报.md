    Old Wu's Big-Character Poster
    On the large blackboard in the "Culture Square" of Renmin University of China, a big-character poster written by Comrade Wu Yuzhang during the "rectification and improvement" phase was posted.
    The title of the big-character poster is: "Accept Criticism, Correct Shortcomings, Improve Work." The big-character poster reads:
    "During the big blooming and contending phase of the rectification movement, some students gave me some suggestions. These suggestions mainly are: I meet with students too infrequently, rarely give reports to students, and they hope I will meet with students more often. I think these suggestions are correct, and I thank the students for their sincere criticism."
    "It should be admitted that bureaucracy, sectarianism, and subjectivism also exist in myself. I am willing to conduct in-depth self-examination during the rectification and improvement phase, strive to improve, and am willing to work with everyone to further transform our thinking through socialist ideological education, improve our understanding, correct our shortcomings, and improve the quality of our work. ..."
    "In the future, I have decided to spend more time going deep into the grassroots, meeting with students more often, and taking more care of the school's work. ..."
    At the end is signed: Wu Yuzhang October 26
    Since the beginning of the semester, whenever the school held a major meeting, Teacher Wu personally attended and gave speeches to the students at the meetings. The students all said, "We can see Old Wu often now!"

    吴老的大字报
    中国人民大学“文化广场”的大黑板上，贴着吴玉章同志在“整改”阶段中所写的一张大字报。
    大字报的标题是：“接受批评，改正缺点，改进工作”。大字报写着：
    “在整风运动中的大鸣大放阶段，有的同学给我提了一些意见。这些意见主要是：我与同学们见面太少，很少给同学们作报告，并希望我与同学们多见面。我认为这些意见是正确的，感谢同学们对我的诚恳批评”。
    “应该承认，官僚主义、宗派主义和主观主义，在我本身也是存在的。我愿意在整改阶段，深入检查，力求改进，并愿与大家一道，通过社会主义思想教育，进一步改造思想，提高认识，改正缺点，提高工作质量。……”
    “今后我决定多抽出一些时间深入下层，与同学们多见面，多管一管学校的工作。……”
    末端署着：吴玉章　10月26日
    开学以来，每逢学校举行的大会，吴老师亲自出席参加，并在会上都给同学们讲了话。同学们都说：“我们能经常见到吴老了！”
      （中国人民大学学生  邢振华）
