    Mass Line in Cotton Purchasing Work
    *People's Daily* Commentator

    This year, cotton purchasing departments in major cotton-producing areas across the country have helped agricultural cooperatives train approximately 150,000 primary-level grading and inspection personnel. These personnel, on the one hand, educate cooperative members about the benefits of grading according to national standards, provide technical education on cotton picking and grading, and promote the "four separations" movement: separate picking, separate drying, separate storage, and separate selling. On the other hand, when selling cotton, they work with the cotton purchasing departments' grading personnel to democratically discuss and assess the cotton's grade, length, ginning outturn, and moisture and impurities, what is known as the "four assessments." This is the working method of following the mass line in cotton purchasing work.

    Experience has proven that wherever this mass line working method is implemented, cotton farmers' enthusiasm for production is high, and cotton purchasing work proceeds smoothly. The result of implementing the "four separations" is the ability to distinguish between good cotton and substandard cotton. Although a small portion of the lower-grade cotton sells for a lower price, the majority of the good cotton can be sold for more money, increasing farmers' income and benefiting the country. After separating good and substandard cotton, the proportion of good cotton increases, and the quality of cotton is standardized, allowing textile industrial departments to implement "good cotton for good use." At the same time, the reduction in cotton grades and the improvement in quality allow industrial and purchasing departments to save considerable manpower and resources in cotton storage and cleaning work.

    This working method has been welcomed by many farmers. The Changxiang Agricultural Cooperative in Cheng'an County, Hebei Province, compared the results of implementing the "four separations" with not implementing it, and the cooperative members all understood the great benefits of implementing the "four separations." The fourth production team of this cooperative, due to separating good and substandard cotton, reducing moisture, and removing impurities, sold raw cotton for an average of 38.1 yuan per dan (approximately 50 kg); while the first production team, which did not carry out the "four separations" work, mixed good and substandard cotton, had high moisture content, and many impurities, resulting in an average sale price of only 33 yuan per dan. Now, the members of this cooperative are all requesting grading and inspection personnel to guide them in doing a good job in the "four separations" work.

    Adopting this working method has better resolved the issue of frequent disputes between purchasing departments and cotton farmers in the assessment of cotton grades over the past few years. Over the years, purchasing departments have generally done a good job in cotton purchasing, and have basically guaranteed reasonable income for cotton farmers. However, in the grading and assessment work, due to the mixing of good and substandard cotton, grading was difficult, and the national grade standards were not clearly explained to farmers, nor were farmer representatives involved in jointly negotiating the grades, so disputes often arose with farmers, affecting the relationship between the state and farmers. After implementing the "four separations" and "four assessments," these disputes have been greatly reduced. For example, in the past, the Nanyuan District Cotton Purchasing Station in Beijing had disputes with farmers almost every day regarding inspection and grading during cotton purchasing. This year, they promoted the "four separations" and "four assessments" method, and from September 10th to mid-October, over more than forty days, only one dispute occurred. Moreover, this one dispute was successfully resolved through democratic consultation.

    Are there any difficulties in implementing the "four separations" and "four assessments"? From a technical point of view, this is not a very complicated matter. It only requires agricultural cooperatives and cotton farmers to avoid mixing cotton from the first, second, and last bolls when picking, and to separately pick cotton affected by pests, dead boll cotton, and good cotton. Then, dry them separately according to the picking classification, and pick out the mixed substandard cotton and impurities. During storage, store them separately according to the drying classification. Finally, sell them separately by category. After the cotton is sent to the purchasing station, technical personnel from the purchasing department and representatives and technical personnel from the agricultural cooperative jointly inspect the cotton's grade, fiber length, ginning outturn, and moisture and impurities according to the national cotton samples and standards, and then determine the grade and price through democratic consultation. According to general experience, agricultural cooperatives' primary-level grading and inspection personnel only need about ten days of training to master these techniques. Whether this method can be implemented mainly depends on whether ideological education work has been done well, whether the cadres and cooperative members recognize the benefits of implementing the "four separations" and "four assessments" for themselves and for the country, and treat the "four separations" and "four assessments" work as their own business, thereby consciously and actively taking action.

    Separately picking cotton can easily reduce the amount of cotton picked, and the work points earned by cooperative members will also be reduced. This becomes an obstacle to promoting this method. This problem is not without a solution. The key still lies in mobilizing the masses and relying on the masses. In some agricultural cooperatives, after educating the masses to recognize the great benefits of the "four separations," everyone created many faster picking methods, such as the double-pocket or three-pocket cotton picking method, the collaborative cotton picking method with several people dividing the work, and the contract cotton picking method with assigned plots, and so on. Some cooperatives also differentiated the quality of cotton according to the different boll-opening periods, stipulated quotas and remuneration standards for picking work, adjusted the original work point recording methods, and many places also established reward and punishment systems related to cotton picking quality. In this way, cooperative members are also willing to implement the "four separations."

    Many places have already gained a lot of experience in implementing cotton "four separations" and "four assessments." All localities should carefully summarize and resolutely promote them. At the same time, it should also be understood that the experience in this regard is not yet very rich or systematic, and it is necessary to continuously absorb the opinions of the masses and continuously improve it in future work, so that this method becomes more complete and mature. This method can also be used in the purchasing work of other agricultural products, wherever there are purchase grade regulations. The experience of following the mass line in the purchasing work of other agricultural products should also be gathered, summarized, and comprehensively promoted.

    购棉工作中的群众路线
    本报评论员
    今年全国各棉产区的棉花采购部门，帮助农业社训练了约十五万初级分级检验人员。这些人员，一方面对社员宣传按照国家规定的等级进行分级的好处，进行采摘棉花分级的技术教育，开展分摘、分晒、分存、分售的“四分”运动；另一方面，在出售棉花的时候，会同棉花采购部门的验级人员，民主协商评定棉花的品级、长度、衣分率和水分杂质，即所谓“四评”。这就是在购棉工作中走群众路线的工作方法。
    经验证明，哪里实行了这种群众路线的工作方法，哪里的棉农生产情绪就高涨，棉花收购工作就进行得顺利。实行“四分”的结果，就能把好棉和次棉分清。这样虽然一小部分低次棉花卖的价格低一点，但是大部分好棉花可以多卖一些钱，农民就可以增加收入，而且对国家也有好处。好棉次棉分开以后，好棉的比重增加了，棉花的品级整齐了，纺织工业部门就可以实行优棉优用；同时，棉花的等级减少和质量提高，工业部门和采购部门在棉花保管和清理工作方面还可以节省不少人力和财力。
    这种工作方法已经受到许多农民的欢迎。河北省成安县长巷农业社把实行“四分”与不实行“四分”进行了对比，社员都了解实行“四分”的好处很大。这个社第四生产队由于好次棉分清，水分降低，杂质清除干净，因而平均每担籽棉卖到三十八元一角；而第一生产队没有进行“四分”工作，好次棉混在一起，水分大，杂质多，结果平均每担籽棉只卖三十三元。现在这个社的社员们都要求分级检验人员指导他们作好“四分”工作。
    采用这种工作方法，使几年来采购部门同棉农在棉花验级评价上经常发生争执的问题，更好地解决了。几年来采购部门在收购棉花中，工作一般是做得好的，也基本上保证了棉农的合理收入。但是在验级评价工作上，由于好次棉混杂，评级困难，同时又没有把国家规定的品级标准向农民讲清楚，没有吸收农民代表共同协商评级，所以常常同农民发生争执，影响了国家同农民的关系。实行了“四分”和“四评”后，这种争执就大大减少了。例如，北京市南苑区棉花收购站以往收购棉花的时候，几乎每天同农民在检验评级上发生争执。今年他们推行了“四分”和“四评”的方法，从9月10日至10月中旬的四十多天中，只发生一次争执。而且这一次已通过民主协商的方法顺利地解决了。
    实行“四分”和“四评”，有没有什么困难呢？从技术上来看，这并不是很复杂的事情。只要求农业社和棉农在采摘棉花的时候，把头喷、二喷和尾稍的棉花不要混在一起，把虫害棉、僵瓣棉同好棉花分别采摘。然后按照采摘的分类进行分晒，同时挑拣混进的次棉和杂质。在保管的时候，按照分晒的分类分别储存。最后是按类分别出售。棉花送到采购站以后，由采购部门技术人员和农业社的代表和技术人员，根据国家规定的棉花样本和标准，共同检验棉花的品级、纤维长度、衣分率和水分杂质，然后经过民主协商确定等级和价格。根据一般的经验，对农业社初级分级检验人员只需训练十天左右，他们就能够掌握这些技术。能不能实行这个方法，问题主要在于是不是做好了思想教育工作，是不是使农业社的干部和社员群众认识到实行“四分”和“四评”对自己和对国家的好处，把“四分”和“四评”工作当作自己的事情，从而自觉地积极地行动起来。
    分摘棉花容易减少采摘的数量，社员所得工分也就会减少。这就成为推行这种方法的一种阻力。这个问题也不是没有办法解决的。关键还在于发动群众、依靠群众。在一些农业社里，教育群众认识到“四分”有很大好处以后，大家就创造了许多较快的采摘方法，如双兜或三兜采棉法，几人分工协作采棉法，分片包干采棉法，等等。有些社还根据棉桃不同的喷放时期，分别棉花的好次，规定采摘工作定额和报酬标准，调整原有评工记分的方法，许多地方还建立了有关摘棉质量的奖惩制度。这样，社员也就乐意实行“四分”了。
    不少地方在实行棉花“四分”和“四评”方面，已经取得了不少经验。各地应该认真地加以总结，坚决地加以推广。同时也要了解，这方面的经验还不是很丰富和很系统的，还需要在今后工作中不断地吸取群众意见，不断地加以改进，使这种方法更加完整，更加成熟。这种方法，在其他农产品的采购工作中，凡是有收购等级规定的，也都可以采用。在其他农产品收购工作中走群众路线的经验，也应该集中起来，加以总结，全面推广。
