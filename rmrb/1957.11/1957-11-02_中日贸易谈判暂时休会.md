Xinhua News Agency, 1st Dispatch: The Sino-Japanese trade negotiations between the Japanese Trade Delegation to China and the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade continued with a plenary meeting on the evening of October 31st. Despite another concession made by the Chinese side on the issue of establishing non-governmental commercial representative offices in each other's countries, an agreement could not be reached. Both sides decided to temporarily conclude the negotiations by issuing a joint statement. This joint statement was signed at 6:00 AM on November 1st. Representing the Japanese side were the eleven representatives of the three groups within the Japanese Trade Delegation to China, headed by Masanosuke Ikeda. Representing the Chinese side were Nan Hanchen, Lei Renmin, Li Zhuchen, and five others.

At the plenary meeting on the 30th, both sides discussed the draft of the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement proposed by the Chinese side and reached an agreement. Both sides also unanimously agreed to include matters related to the establishment of permanently stationed non-governmental commercial representative offices in a memorandum, forming an inseparable part of the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement.

At the plenary meeting on the 31st, both sides held a final negotiation on the outstanding issue of establishing non-governmental commercial representative offices in each other's countries. In order to strive for an agreement, the Chinese side made a second concession on many issues. However, the Japanese side believed that it was necessary to take the draft of the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement and the memorandum back to Japan for discussion, and therefore suggested adjourning the negotiations. In view of the Japanese side's request, the Chinese side agreed to the adjournment.

Both sides expressed their hope at the plenary meeting that negotiations would resume soon in order to sign the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement.

According to Xinhua News Agency, 31st Dispatch: Nan Hanchen, Chairman of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, held a banquet on the evening of October 31st to bid farewell to the Japanese Trade Delegation to China. The delegation will return to Japan in batches tomorrow and the day after.

Nan Hanchen said in his speech at the banquet that the negotiators on both sides were very friendly during the negotiation process of the past month. This fully proves the increasing growth of the friendly relations between the Chinese and Japanese peoples.

Masanosuke Ikeda said in his reply that during the negotiation process, the personnel of both sides established friendship and sincere feelings, and fully exchanged opinions, which is of great significance for the future relationship between the two countries.

    中日贸易谈判暂时休会
    新华社1日讯　日本访华通商使节团同中国国际贸易促进委员会举行的中日贸易谈判，10月31日晚上继续举行了全体会议。在有关互设民间商务代表机构的问题上，中国方面虽然再作一次让步，但终于没有能够达成协议。双方决定以发表一项共同声明来暂时结束这次谈判。这项共同声明已在11月1日早晨六时签字。代表日本方面签字的是以池田正之辅为首的日本访华通商使节团中三团体代表十一人，代表中国方面签字的是南汉宸、雷任民、李烛尘等八人。
    双方在30日的全体会议上，曾就中国方面所建议的第四次中日贸易协定草案进行讨论，并达成了协议。双方还一致同意将互设常驻的民间商务代表机构的有关事项列入备忘录内，构成第四次中日贸易协定不可分割的一部分。
  在31日的全体会议上，双方对互设民间商务代表机构的悬案问题又作最后一次谈判。中国方面为争取达成协议，在许多问题上作了第二次的让步，但日本方面认为需要把第四次中日贸易协定草案和备忘录带回国去商讨，因而建议中止谈判。中国方面鉴于日本方面的要求，同意休会。
    双方在全体会议上表示希望早日恢复谈判，以便签订第四次中日贸易协定。
    据新华社31日讯　中国国际贸易促进委员会主席南汉宸10月31日晚举行宴会，欢送日本访华通商使节团。这个代表团将在明天和后天分批回国。
    南汉宸在宴会上致词说，在过去一个多月的谈判过程中，双方谈判人员十分友好。这充分证明了中日两国人民友好关系的日益增进。
    池田正之辅在答词中说，在这次谈判过程中，双方人员建立了友谊和坦率的友情，并且充分地交换了意见，这对两国将来的关系有很大的意义。
