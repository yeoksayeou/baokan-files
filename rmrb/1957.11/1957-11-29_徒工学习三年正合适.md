    A Three-Year Apprenticeship is Just Right
    We four are apprentice workers who just entered the factory last year and are now studying politics at the Beijing First Machine Tool Plant Political School. Our school discussed the State Council's draft temporary regulations regarding the apprenticeship period and living allowance for apprentices, and we believe this regulation is completely correct.
    Some people say that a three-year apprenticeship is too long, but we think it is just right. A shorter time simply wouldn't work. When we entered the factory last year, it was said that we would be promoted to third-grade workers after one year. We were really happy at the time, but as the promotion date approached, we became truly afraid, worried that if we were really promoted, we wouldn't be able to do the work. Our skills are indeed very poor, and we can only learn single-process work. Compared with our third-grade masters, we are far behind! With the apprenticeship period changed to three years, we will have enough time to learn well from our masters.
    Our current living allowance of 34 yuan per month is indeed too high. Because young people lack political tempering, they easily become corrupt when they get more money, and they don't study technology diligently. Among the apprentices in the No. 2 Machining Workshop, 80% have learned to smoke, and they only smoke Hengda and Da Qianmen cigarettes. Some people are also very particular about their clothes, buying four pairs of woolen pants and still not being satisfied. Because apprentices only pursue personal enjoyment and do not study technology diligently, they also look down on their masters. We believe that giving less living allowance would not only benefit the country, but also enable apprentices to develop a hardworking and simple style and study technology well. Moreover, the wealth we apprentices create for the country is very small, while the masters create great value, and their wages are only slightly higher than ours. If we don't lower the allowance, the masters will also have opinions.
    Based on the above situation, we request the implementation of the State Council's regulations on the apprenticeship period and living allowance for apprentices.

    徒工学习三年正合适
    我们四个人都是去年刚进厂的学徒工，现在在北京第一机床厂政治学校学习政治。我们学校讨论了国务院关于学徒学习期限和生活补贴的暂时规定草案，认为这个规定完全正确。
    有人说学习三年太长了，我们认为很合适，时间太短了确实不行。去年我们进厂时，说一年后升三级工。当时真高兴，但快到升级的时候，心里却真害怕，怕真的升了级，干不了活怎么办？我们的技术确实很差，只能学会单一的工序工作，和我们的三级师傅比，真差得远呢！学徒工期限改为三年，我们才有充分的时间向师傅好好再学。
    我们现在的生活补贴每月三十四元，确实太高了。因为青年人缺乏政治锻炼，钱拿得多了，生活就容易腐化，不好好钻研技术。加工二车间的学徒，现在有80％的人学会了抽烟，而且光抽恒大和大前门的。有的人也很讲究穿，买了四条料子裤还不满意。由于学徒光追求个人享乐，不好好学技术，也看不起师傅了，我们认为生活补贴少给一些，不但对国家有好处，而且也可以使徒工养成艰苦朴素的作风，能好好学习技术。再说，我们学徒给国家创造的财富是很少的，师傅们创造的价值大，而工资比我们的只多一点。不降低，师傅也会有意见。
    根据以上情况，我们要求实行国务院关于学徒工期限和生活补贴的规定。
