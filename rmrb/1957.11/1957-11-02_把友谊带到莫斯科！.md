    Bring Friendship to Moscow!
    To welcome the October Revolution Day, the teachers and students of the Beijing Institute of Aeronautics have decided to present a "Friendship Box" to the Moscow Aviation Institute.
    Currently, teachers, staff, and students of the Beijing Institute of Aeronautics are busily preparing meaningful gifts and writing congratulatory letters to enrich the "Friendship Box." As of now, the Communist Youth League Committee has received more than 280 congratulatory letters. Among these gifts are various meaningful medals and commemorative badges, precious landscape paintings, Hangzhou embroidery symbolizing Sino-Soviet friendship, exquisite handicrafts, and ingenious aircraft models... To enable Soviet friends to hear the voice of friendship, the institute is producing a reel of audio tape to send to the Moscow Aviation Institute. The tape's content includes festive greetings, selections from the literary and art societies' programs, and live recordings of celebration activities. (Ren Ren)
