On the warm and sunny morning of November 17th, the Beijing Municipal Games track and field competition was being held at the Xian Nong Tan Stadium. The southeast corner of the Xian Nong Tan Stadium's stands is usually the least popular place for spectators to sit, but today was an exception; the audience crowded into these stands. This was because the famous national athlete, Zheng Fengrong, was giving a high jump performance in the southeast corner of the field.

The high jump bar was constantly being raised, and Zheng Fengrong, wearing white shorts, easily and happily cleared 1 meter 56, 1 meter 60, 1 meter 64, 1 meter 68... Now it was time to jump 1 meter 72. For Zheng Fengrong, this height was achievable, but judging from her facial expression, she wasn't as relaxed as before. Zheng Fengrong made some preparatory movements, approached the starting line, and after a quick run-up, she crossed the bar and landed skillfully and lightly in the sand pit.

"1 meter 77..." Zheng Fengrong said to the referee.

When the loudspeaker announced this height, the stands immediately erupted in a commotion: "Increasing it by 5 centimeters at once, that's 1 centimeter higher than the world record! The girl's ambition is really not small!"

The staff were busy measuring the dimensions and leveling the ground. After a lot of time had passed, Zheng Fengrong, who was resting, said, "Let me jump quickly!" She kept making marks on the ground with her running shoes, and then measured the distance between the bar and the take-off point with her arm... It seemed that she was extremely nervous. Finally, she stood at the starting line, staring at the bar, as if she had forgotten how to jump over it. The field also became tense, and everyone fell silent. The photographers prepared everything to capture this meaningful moment with their cameras.

In an instant, Zheng Fengrong had already started her run-up, quickly approaching the bar. She crossed the bar with one leg, followed immediately by the sound of the bar falling to the ground... The first attempt failed!

People around her were comforting her, hoping she would relax, move around a bit, and prepare for the second jump.

Now, not only Zheng Fengrong herself, but also the people around the high jump rack and the audience in the stands felt nervous.

Zheng Fengrong constantly massaged and stroked her arms and thighs. Then, she looked at the bar, clenched her lips, and rushed forward. Her body flew over like a swallow.

Success! The whole stadium erupted in applause, congratulating Zheng Fengrong on her success. Zheng Fengrong herself also jumped up, accepting congratulations from all around. The entire area around the high jump rack was immersed in a joyful atmosphere.

The performance did not end there. Zheng Fengrong then requested that the bar be raised to 1 meter 80 centimeters, but failed three times in a row. Despite this, Zheng Fengrong had achieved her goal for the year. After the performance, Zheng Fengrong said, "I will consolidate this achievement and strive to create a new record."

The people of the whole country are looking forward to this young world women's high jump record breaker creating even better records and winning glory for the great motherland. Yan Shixiong (with picture)

    郑凤荣跳过了1．77公尺
    风和日暖的11月17日上午，北京先农坛体育场正在举行北京市运动会田径比赛。先农坛体育场的东南角看台，平常是观众最不爱坐的地方，可是今天却是例外，观众们都挤在这几个看台上。这是因为著名的国家选手郑凤荣，正在田径场的东南角上作跳高表演。
    跳高架的横竿不时地往上升着，穿着白色短裤的郑凤荣轻松愉快地跳过了1公尺56、1公尺60、1公尺64、1公尺68……。现在该是跳1公尺72的时候，对郑凤荣来说，这个高度是可以越过的，但从她的面部表情来看，她没有像刚才那么轻松；郑凤荣做了下准备动作，走近了起跑线，一阵快速助跑后，就跨过了横竿，巧妙轻盈地落在沙坑里。
    “1公尺77……”，郑凤荣对裁判说。
    当扩音器传出了这个高度之后，看台上马上就喧哗了起来：“一下子就加5公分，比世界纪录还高1公分，姑娘的雄心可真不小呀！”
    工作人员忙着量尺寸，平场地，时间过了很多，正在休息的郑凤荣说：“让我快些跳吧！”她自己又不住用跑鞋在地上做标志，接着又用手臂量了一下横竿与起跳点之间的距离，……看来，她是紧张极了。最后，她在起跑线上站着，眼睛盯着横竿，好像要忘了跳过去一样。场上也紧张了起来，大家都沉默着。摄影记者准备好了一切，要把这个有意义的镜头，收入镜箱。
    刹那间，郑凤荣已经开始助跑了，很快就奔近了横竿，只见她一脚跨过了横竿，接着马上就是一阵横竿落地声，……第一次试跳失败了！
    四周的人们在安慰她，希望她好好地放松一下，再活动一下，准备跳第二次。
    现在不仅是郑凤荣自己，连跳高架四周的人们，看台上的观众也感到紧张。
    郑凤荣不时地按摩、抚摸着手臂和大腿。接着，她对准横竿看，咬紧了嘴唇，向前冲去。她的身体像燕子般地飞过去了。
    成功了！全场响起了掌声，祝贺郑凤荣的成功。郑凤荣自己也跳了起来，她接受了四周的祝贺。整个跳高架的四周浸沉在欢乐的气氛中。
    表演并没有结束，接着郑凤荣要求把横竿继续加至一公尺八十公分，接连三次都失败了。尽管这样，郑凤荣今年的目标是达到了。表演结束后，郑凤荣说：“我将巩固这个成绩，争取创造更新的纪录。”
