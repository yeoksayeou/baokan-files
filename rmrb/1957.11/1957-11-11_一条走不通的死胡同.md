    A Dead End That Leads Nowhere
    By a commentator of this newspaper
    U.S. President Eisenhower delivered a speech on the 7th of this month entitled "Science in National Security," a rant resulting from a combined attack of the weakness of the U.S.'s "position of strength" policy and the hysteria of expanding armaments. In this speech, Eisenhower put forward an action program that attempts to further concentrate America's scientific power on the work of destroying humanity, which is to say, an action program to accelerate the nuclear arms race. Just as people of all countries are yearning for the rapid development of science and technology to create more favorable conditions for peaceful coexistence and peaceful competition, this speech by the U.S. President can undoubtedly only arouse deep disgust and opposition from people.
    The reason why the U.S. President had to deliver this speech at this time, and was forced to deliver it a week earlier than he originally planned, was to urgently stabilize the hearts of the American ruling group and its partners, which had been thrown into chaos and panic by the successive launch of two artificial satellites by the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union's great scientific innovations have once again proven with ironclad facts that the socialist system is far superior to capitalism; the Soviet Union has definitely moved ahead of the United States in the development of science and technology. At the same time, it has further proven that the "position of strength" policy on which the U.S. ruling group and its partners rely has completely gone bankrupt. When people look up at space, they see two Soviet artificial satellites operating normally every day, but there is no trace of even a tiny American satellite. Where is the "strength" of the United States that is greater than that of the Soviet Union? This has not only created a "national sense of disappointment" in the United States, but has also greatly shaken the confidence of some of America's followers in the United States, not to mention many countries in Asia and Africa.
    However, instead of soberly facing the current situation and reconsidering U.S. policy, the U.S. President continues to boast about America's military strength. In his speech, Eisenhower listed the U.S. military equipment, flaunted the power of these equipment, and even exaggerated that "the entire military strength of the free world is stronger than the entire military strength of the communist countries." This is just like the teacher in our Peking Opera "Hitting the Fishing Family," who uses waving his fists and making a show to embolden himself, which does not help the actual situation. The myth that the so-called "free world" maintains a military advantage over the socialist camp has long been shattered. Now that the Soviet Union has successfully launched intercontinental ballistic missiles and artificial earth satellites, it is even more ridiculous for the U.S. ruling group to flaunt its "deterrent power." Even U.S. Senator McClellan did not believe the U.S. President's boast about U.S. military strength. The senator pointed out that although the purpose of this speech was to stabilize people's hearts, "it is not entirely convincing."
    In his speech, the U.S. President called for intensifying the mobilization of the military scientific forces of the United States and other countries in the North Atlantic group to develop missiles and catch up with the Soviet Union. In Eisenhower's own words, "We (referring to the United States) must strive to ensure that any advantage they (referring to the Soviet Union) have is only temporary." However, the Soviet Union's advantage over the United States is more than just missiles. In addition to possessing intercontinental ballistic missiles, in recent years, the Soviet Union has built the first atomic power station, manufactured jet-powered passenger aircraft, launched the first and second artificial satellites, and is building the first atomic-powered icebreaker. This series of achievements of the Soviet Union is due to the superior social system of the Soviet Union and the result of the extensive development of the Soviet Union in science. The spokesperson of the U.S. President's Committee of Scientists and Engineers also admitted not long ago that the Soviet Union's achievement in launching artificial satellites "is not an isolated achievement caused by an overriding plan, but another proof of the widespread development in science." The backwardness of the United States in science and technology is precisely the inevitable result of the American social system, especially the reactionary imperialist policy it pursues. In his own speech, the U.S. President also admitted that the United States had already focused the center and emphasis of scientific research on long-range ballistic missiles in the past few years, and spent as much as 1 billion U.S. dollars a year on this project alone. However, despite this, the United States is still backward. It can be seen that trying to catch up with the Soviet Union from the path of intensifying the arms race in order to regain the advantage that the United States has long lost is already a dead end that leads nowhere. If the United States continues to drill into this dead end, facts will continue to prove that the United States will be even more trapped in a tragic situation.
    The so-called advantage of the United States over the Soviet Union, and the so-called advantage of the entire imperialist camp over the socialist camp, is definitely gone forever. The only future for the United States and its partners is to coexist peacefully with socialist countries and compete under peaceful conditions.

    一条走不通的死胡同
    本报评论员
    美国总统艾森豪威尔于本月7日发表了一篇题为“国家安全中的科学问题”的演说，这是美国“实力地位”政策的虚弱症和扩张军备的歇斯底里症的合并发作而引起的一阵叫嚷。在这个演说里，艾森豪威尔提出了一个企图把美国的科学力量进一步集中在毁灭人类的工作上的行动纲领，也就是一个加速进行核武器竞赛的行动纲领。正当各国人民渴望着科学技术的飞速发展为和平共处和和平竞赛造成了更为有利的条件的时候，美国总统的这个演说无疑只能引起人们的深刻的厌恶和反对。
    美国总统所以要在这个时候发表这篇演说，并且被迫比他原来预定的时间提早了一个星期发表，这是为了急欲稳定由于苏联连续发射了两颗人造卫星而使美国统治集团及其伙伴陷于混乱和惊慌失措的人心。苏联的伟大的科学创举，以铁的事实再一次证明：社会主义制度要比资本主义远为优越；苏联在科学技术的发展上已肯定地走到美国的前面去了。同时，它也进一步证明了美国统治集团及其伙伴所依恃的“实力地位”政策是彻底破产了。当人们仰望太空的时候，每天所看到的是两个在正常运行的苏联的人造卫星，却没有那怕是极小的美国的卫星的踪迹，那末美国比苏联强大的“实力”何在呢？这不但造成了美国的“民族失望感”，而且也使得美国的一些追随者对美国的信心大大地动摇了，更不用说许多亚洲和非洲的国家了。
    但是，美国总统却不是清醒地面对目前的现实局势，来重新考虑美国的政策，而是继续吹嘘美国的军事实力。艾森豪威尔在他的演说中列举了美国军事装备的情况，炫耀这些装备的威力，甚至还夸张所谓“自由世界的全部军事力量要比共产党国家的全部军事力量强大”。这正像我国京剧“打渔杀家”里的那个教师爷，以舞拳弄棍、装腔作势来给自己壮胆一样，是无补于实际的。所谓“自由世界”对社会主义阵营保有军事优势的那种神话早已破灭了。现在苏联已经成功地放射了洲际弹道导弹和人造地球卫星，美国统治集团还要炫耀自己的“威慑力量”，那就更加可笑了。美国总统对美国军事实力的吹嘘，连美国参议员麦克利兰也不肯相信。这位参议员指出，虽然这篇演说的目的是安定人心，“可是它并不是完全令人信服的。”
    美国总统在他的演说中，要求加紧动员美国以及北大西洋集团其他国家的军事科学力量，来发展导弹，赶上苏联。用艾森豪威尔自己的话来说，就是“我们（指美国）必须努力做到，他们（指苏联）取得的任何优势都只是暂时的”。但是，苏联对美国的优势又何止仅仅是导弹一项呢。除了拥有洲际弹道导弹以外，这几年来，苏联建成了第一座原子发电站，制成了喷气发动的载运旅客的飞机，发射了第一颗和第二颗人造卫星，正在建造第一艘原子发动的破冰船。苏联的这一系列的成就，是由于苏联的优越的社会制度，是由于苏联在科学方面广泛发展的结果。美国总统的科学家和工程师委员会的发言人在不久前也承认：苏联发射人造卫星的成就，“并不是一种压倒一切的计划所造成的孤立的成就，而是再一次证明了在科学方面的广泛发展。”而美国在科学技术方面的落后，也正是美国的社会制度，特别是它所奉行的帝国主义反动政策的必然结果。美国总统在他自己的演说中，也承认美国在过去的几年中就早已把科学研究的中心和重点放在远程弹道导弹上了，而且单单在这个项目上每年就要花费十亿美元之巨。可是，尽管这样，美国依然是落后的。可见，想从加紧军备竞赛这条道路上来赶过苏联，以求挽回美国早已失掉的优势，已经是一条走不通的死胡同了。如果美国继续向这条死胡同里钻，事实将会继续证明，美国将更加陷于悲惨的境地。
    美国对苏联的所谓优势，整个帝国主义阵营对社会主义阵营的所谓优势，是已经肯定地一去不复返了。对于美国和它的伙伴们的唯一前途，是同社会主义国家和平共处，并在和平的条件下进行竞赛。
