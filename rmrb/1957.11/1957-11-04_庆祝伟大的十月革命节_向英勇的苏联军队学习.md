    Celebrating the Great October Revolution Festival
    Learning from the Heroic Soviet Army
    Peng Dehuai

    Forty years ago, the great October Socialist Revolution opened a new era in human history. The decadent capitalist system began to give way to the emerging socialist system. Human history has since turned a new page.

    The socialist system first built in the Soviet Union is the most progressive social system in history. The Soviet regime is the most progressive and democratic regime in history. All the working people of the Soviet Union have completely shaken off their exploited and oppressed status, gained genuine liberation, enjoyed full democratic and free rights, and become the masters of the country. The socialist revolution in the Soviet Union eliminated domestic capitalism and all forms of exploitation, transformed the private ownership of the means of production into public ownership, and thoroughly liberated the social productive forces. The Soviet Union's socialist economy and scientific and cultural undertakings have developed at an unprecedented speed, and the material and cultural lives of the working people have been continuously improved and raised. The Soviet state has established a large family of equality, harmony, and friendship among all nationalities at home, established fraternal close unity among various socialist countries based on the spirit of internationalism, equality, and mutual assistance, and insisted on advocating peaceful coexistence with countries with different social systems. The unparalleled superiority of the socialist system has been fully demonstrated in the Soviet Union, and has continued to be proven in the victorious development of various socialist countries. The socialist system will inevitably develop vigorously along the path of the October Revolution, which cannot be stopped by any force.

    In the flames of the October Revolution, the Soviet people established a completely new type of revolutionary army on the basis of the Red Guards. This army was established under the leadership of the great Bolshevik Party headed by Lenin, using the revolutionary method of arming workers and peasants and thoroughly disintegrating the old army. The establishment of this army was absolutely necessary to defend the fruits of the great October Revolution. Lenin once said in his book "The Proletarian Revolution and the Renegade Kautsky": "The new social class that has risen to the ruling position can never achieve and consolidate its ruling position unless it completely disintegrates the old army, unless it experiences the most difficult and painful period without any army (the French Revolution also experienced such a most painful period), and unless it gradually creates a new army, new discipline, and new military organization of the new class in the arduous domestic war." History has proved that Lenin's argument is completely correct. This is one of the important historical experiences left to us by the great October Revolution. It was precisely because the Soviet people, under the leadership of the Bolshevik Party, created such a new type of army, the Red Army of Workers and Peasants, in a timely manner that they successfully defended the fruits of the October Revolution and victoriously walked through forty years of glory. The heroic and powerful Soviet army defeated the domestic counter-revolutionary armed rebellion and the armed intervention of imperialism, and also defeated the fascist invading army in the Great Patriotic War, defended the security of the motherland, and rescued mankind from fascist enslavement. The Soviet army is the strongest pillar of the socialist camp and a loyal friend of all oppressed people and peace-loving people.

    The reason why the Soviet army was able to develop, grow stronger, and achieve great success is because it is an army of the working people and an army of all nationalities in the Soviet Union. It is fundamentally different from the armies of all exploiting classes. Lenin once vividly quoted an old woman's words: "The soldiers of the old army protect the landlords and capitalists, while the revolutionary soldiers protect the poor." "Now there is no need to be afraid of people with guns." Lenin believed that this was a noble award to the Red Army. The reason why the Soviet army is so powerful is precisely because such a close relationship has been established between the army and the people. In socialist countries, the army is no longer a tool for oppressing the people, but a powerful weapon for the people to defend the fruits of the revolution. The people have become the source of strength for the revolutionary army. The people of all nationalities in the Soviet Union, both in the severe war period and in the period of peaceful construction, have enthusiastically supported their army with selfless labor, with great production achievements, and with the latest science and technology. Therefore, the Soviet army was able to defeat all enemies in the war, continuously strengthen and improve the combat effectiveness of the army, and become the world's leading powerful and modern revolutionary armed force.

      The strong leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union over the Soviet army is the fundamental guarantee for the Soviet army to achieve great victories. The Party has formulated the principles for building the army and various fundamental systems for the Soviet army, consolidated the strong unity within the army, and established close ties with the people of all nationalities. The Party educated the Soviet army in the spirit of Marxism-Leninism. The Communist Party members in the Soviet army used their exemplary actions to unite all soldiers and successfully carry out the sacred task of defending the motherland. Under the guidance of the Party, the Soviet army has worked tirelessly for the cause of world peace and the cause of human progress, and has made brilliant contributions, winning the heartfelt love of oppressed nations and peace-loving people all over the world.

    The Soviet army's military science and technology have reached the world's most advanced level. This is a brilliant victory achieved by dialectical materialism in the military field. The Soviet army has gained rich experience in modern warfare in the great achievements of crushing the German fascists and Japanese militarist army. After World War II, it made amazing achievements in military technology and science. The success of the intercontinental ballistic missile demonstrates the indisputable superiority of the Soviet military's technology and science. This greatly enhances the power of the Soviet army, making it a huge force for defending and promoting world peace.

    The Soviet state born from the October Revolution is a great example for our country's socialist construction, and the Soviet army born from the October Revolution is also a great example for our army's modernization construction. Learning from the Soviet Union and learning from the Soviet army has been a firm and unwavering policy of the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese People's Liberation Army for a long time. Thirty years ago, when the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong created the Chinese People's Revolutionary Armed Forces, they learned and applied many valuable experiences of the Soviet Red Army based on China's actual conditions. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, when the Chinese People's Liberation Army entered a new period of modernization construction, the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong promptly called on us to learn all the advanced experiences of the Soviet army. All comrades of the Chinese People's Liberation Army warmly responded to this call, launched a wave of learning from the Soviet army throughout the army, and achieved significant results. In the future, we should continue to work hard to learn from the Soviet army. We should also learn from the armies of other socialist countries. As long as we adhere to the correct learning attitude and adhere to the pragmatic learning method, our army's modernization construction can avoid many detours. All comrades of the Chinese People's Liberation Army should use the achievements of our learning to commemorate the fortieth anniversary of the great October Revolution.

    The glory of the October Revolution encourages people all over the world to move forward to the future with confidence. The Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, like the Soviet people and the Soviet army, are welcoming and celebrating this great festival with joy and excitement. Our common cause, the just cause of mankind, will surely be victorious. The Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army must always unite with the great Soviet people and the Soviet army to fight to the end to defend world peace and to realize the lofty ideals of socialism and communism.

    庆祝伟大的十月革命节
    向英勇的苏联军队学习
    彭德怀
    四十年前伟大的十月社会主义革命，开辟了人类历史的新时代。腐朽的资本主义制度开始让位于新兴的社会主义制度。人类的历史从此揭开了新的一页。
    在苏联第一次建成的社会主义制度，是有史以来最进步的社会制度。苏维埃政权，是有史以来最进步最民主的政权。苏联的全体劳动人民，彻底摆脱了被剥削被压迫的地位，获得了真正的解放，享有充分的民主自由权利，成为国家的主人。苏联的社会主义革命，消灭了国内资本主义和一切剥削制度，把生产资料的私有制变成为公有制，彻底解放了社会生产力。苏联的社会主义经济和科学文化事业，以史无前例的速度向前发展，劳动人民的物质生活和文化生活，不断地得到改善和提高。苏维埃国家，在国内建立了各民族平等和睦友爱的大家庭，在各个社会主义国家之间，本着国际主义和平等互助的精神，建立了兄弟般的亲密团结，并且坚持主张与不同社会制度的各国和平共处。社会主义制度的无比优越性，已经在苏联充分表现出来，在各个社会主义国家的胜利发展中又继续得到了证明。社会主义制度必将沿着十月革命的道路生气勃勃地向前发展，这是任何力量都不能阻挡的。
    在十月革命的烈火中，苏联人民在赤卫军的基础上建立起来一支完全新型的革命军队。这支军队是在以列宁为首的伟大的布尔什维克党的领导下，用武装工人农民和彻底瓦解旧军队的革命方法建立起来的。建立这支军队，是保卫伟大十月革命的成果所绝对必需的。列宁在“无产阶级革命与叛徒考茨基”一书中，曾经说过：“升到统治地位的新社会阶级，若不完全瓦解旧军队，若不经历没有任何军队的最困难、最痛苦的时期（法国大革命也曾经历过这样最痛苦的时期），若不逐渐在艰苦国内战争中，创造出新阶级的新军队、新纪律、新军事组织，——那它始终也不能达到与巩固自己的统治地位。”历史证明了列宁这个论断是完全正确的。这是伟大十月革命留给我们的重要历史经验之一。苏联人民，正是由于在布尔什维克党的领导下，适时地创建了这样一支新型的军队，即工农红军，才胜利地保卫了十月革命的成果，胜利地走过了四十年光荣的道路。英勇的强大的苏联军队，战胜了国内反革命武装叛乱和帝国主义的武装干涉，又在伟大的卫国战争中，打败了法西斯侵略军，保卫了祖国的安全，并且把人类从法西斯奴役中拯救出来。苏联军队是社会主义阵营最坚强的支柱，是一切被压迫人民和爱好和平人民的忠实朋友。
    苏联军队所以能够发展、壮大和获得巨大的成就，因为它是劳动人民的军队，是苏联各族人民的军队。它与一切剥削阶级的军队有着根本的区别。列宁曾经生动地引述过一个老太婆的话：“旧军队的兵士是保护地主资本家的，革命兵士却保护穷人。”“现在用不着害怕带枪的人了。”列宁认为这是对红军高贵的奖誉。苏联军队之所以强有力正是由于军队和人民之间建立了这样亲密的关系。在社会主义国家，军队不再是压迫人民的工具，而是人民保卫革命成果的有力武器。人民也就成为革命军队力量的源泉。苏联各族人民在严重的战争时期与和平建设时期，都以忘我的劳动，以巨大的生产成就，以最新的科学技术，热烈支援自己的军队。因而苏联军队，就得以在战争中战胜一切敌人，不断地加强和提高军队的战斗力，成为世界上头等强大的现代化的革命武装。
      苏联共产党对苏军的坚强领导，是苏军获得巨大胜利的根本保证。党为苏军制定了建军原则和各项根本制度，巩固了军队内部的坚强团结，和各族人民建立了亲密的联系。党用马克思列宁主义的精神教育苏军。苏军中的共产党员，用自己的模范行动，团结全体军人，胜利执行保卫祖国的神圣任务。苏军在党的教导下，为世界和平事业和人类进步事业奋斗不懈，并且作出了光辉的贡献，获得了全世界被压迫民族和爱好和平人民的衷心爱戴。
    苏军的军事科学和技术都达到了世界最先进的水平。这是辩证唯物主义在军事领域内所取得的光辉胜利。苏军在粉碎德国法西斯和日本军国主义军队的丰功伟绩中，取得了现代化作战的丰富经验。第二次世界大战后，在军事技术科学上，又取得了惊人的成就。洲际弹道导弹的成功，显示了苏军技术科学无可争辩的优越性。这就大大增强了苏军威力，使它成为保卫和促进世界和平的巨大力量。
    十月革命诞生的苏维埃国家是我国社会主义建设的伟大榜样，十月革命诞生的苏联军队也是我军现代化建设的伟大榜样。向苏联学习，向苏联军队学习，这是中国共产党和中国人民解放军长期以来坚定不移的方针。三十年前，中国共产党和毛泽东同志创建中国人民革命武装的时候，就从中国的实际情况出发，学习和运用了苏联红军的许多宝贵经验。中华人民共和国成立以后，中国人民解放军进入了现代化建设的新时期，中国共产党和毛泽东同志又及时地号召我们把苏军的一切先进经验学到手。中国人民解放军全体同志，热烈地响应了这个号召，在全军掀起了向苏军学习的热潮，并且取得了重大的成绩。今后我们应当继续努力地向苏联军队学习。我们也应当向其他社会主义国家的军队学习。只要我们坚持正确的学习态度，坚持实事求是的学习方法，我军的现代化建设就可以少走许多弯路。中国人民解放军全体同志，应该用我们学习的成绩，来纪念伟大的十月革命四十周年。
    十月革命的光辉，鼓舞着全世界人民满怀信心地向未来迈进。中国人民、中国人民解放军和苏联人民、苏联军队一样，怀着欢欣鼓舞的心情，迎接和庆祝这个伟大的节日。我们的共同事业，人类的正义事业，必将获得胜利。中国人民和中国人民解放军，一定要和伟大的苏联人民、苏联军队永远地团结在一起，为保卫世界和平，为实现社会主义、共产主义的崇高理想奋斗到底。
