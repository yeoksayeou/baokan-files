    (Reported from Kunming) A number of upper-level figures from Yunnan Province's minority nationalities, in a discussion of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's "Report on the Rectification Campaign," expressed their support for carrying out socialist education in minority areas and criticizing bourgeois local nationalism tendencies.

    Zhao Zhongqi (Hui nationality), a representative of the National People's Congress, a member of the Provincial People's Committee, and Director of the Kunming Hui Muslim Cultural Advancement Association, said: "The Hui nationality, like other minority nationalities, is a nationality that has been oppressed and discriminated against. Only after liberation did we truly stand up. The Hui nationality is determined to take the socialist road, but there is also a small number of bad elements among the upper levels of the Hui nationality, like Ma Bo'an and his ilk, who oppose the leadership of the Communist Party and oppose socialism. But we must wage a resolute struggle against these rightist elements." He also said, "Although socialist reforms have been carried out in areas inhabited by the Hui nationality, socialist consciousness is still not high. Comrade Deng Xiaoping's proposal to carry out socialist education among minority nationalities is very correct." Cha Guangzhou (Yi nationality), representative of the Provincial People's Congress and Vice Chairman of the Political Consultative Conference of the Nujiang Lisu Autonomous Prefecture, believes that without the leadership of the Communist Party, there would be no status for minority nationalities. If minority nationalities do not take the socialist road, it is impossible to get rid of backwardness and poverty. He said: "I firmly support Comrade Deng Xiaoping's report. If we do not carry out socialist education in ethnic minority areas and do not oppose Han chauvinism and local nationalism, it is impossible to carry out socialist construction in ethnic minority areas; it is impossible to achieve the unity of the motherland and the unity between all nationalities." He also said: "Among the upper-level figures of the ethnic groups, some people say: Since we have implemented ethnic regional autonomy, why does the Party still have to manage us? Some Communist Party members from minority nationalities also have this narrow nationalist tendency, and some have even proposed the establishment of a minority nationality Communist Party. This tendency is extremely dangerous." Li Hecai (Hani nationality), Chairman of the Political Consultative Conference of the Honghe Hani and Yi Autonomous Prefecture, said: "Before liberation, when people mentioned minority nationalities, they only knew Han, Manchu, Mongolian, Hui, and Tibetan. Who knew about Hani, Lisu, Lahu, and other minority nationalities? After liberation, the minority nationalities truly became masters of their own affairs. Not only can they enter Kunming and Beijing, but the whole country is their home." He also said: "I firmly support Comrade Deng Xiaoping's report, insist on carrying out socialist education in minority areas, resolutely criticize bourgeois nationalist tendencies, and strengthen unity and unification among nationalities." Duan Chengjin (Han nationality), a member of the Nujiang Lisu Autonomous Prefecture Committee and Deputy County Head of Lushui County, said: "Comrade Deng Xiaoping's report is timely and correct. Only by thoroughly criticizing Han chauvinism and local nationalism will it be conducive to ethnic unity." He said: "Socialism is the only way for minority nationalities to get rid of poverty; without the leadership of the Communist Party and the help of the Han people, minority nationalities cannot embark on the socialist road."

    离开了共产党的领导和汉族的帮助
    少数民族就不能走上社会主义道路
    云南少数民族上层人士赞成在少数民族地区进行社会主义教育
    本报昆明讯　云南省部分民族上层人士，座谈邓小平同志“关于整风运动的报告”，纷纷表示拥护在少数民族地区进行社会主义教育及批判资产阶级地方民族主义倾向。
    全国人民代表大会代表、省人民委员会委员、昆明市回民文化协进会主任委员赵锺奇（回族）说：“回族也同其它少数民族一样，是受压迫受歧视的民族，解放后，才真正的翻了身。回族是要坚决走社会主义道路的，但在回族上层也有一小部分坏分子，像马伯安之流，他们反对共产党领导，反对社会主义。可是我们对这些右派分子一定要作坚决斗争。”他又说：“回族居住的地区虽然进行过社会主义改革，但社会主义觉悟还是不高的。邓小平同志提出在少数民族中进行社会主义教育是很正确的。”省人民代表大会代表、怒江傈僳族自治州政协副主席茶光洲（彝族）认为，没有共产党的领导，就没有少数民族的地位。少数民族如果不走社会主义道路，就不可能摆脱落后贫困的面貌。他说：“我坚决拥护邓小平同志的报告，如果在民族地区不进行社会主义教育，不反对大汉族主义和地方民族主义，就不可能进行民族地区的社会主义建设；就不可能实现祖国的统一和各民族之间的团结。”他又说：“在民族上层人士中，有些人说：既然实行民族区域自治，为什么还要党来管着我们。少数民族中的有些共产党员，也存在着这种狭隘的民族主义倾向，有些人还提出成立少数民族共产党。这种倾向是极其危险的。”红河哈尼族彝族自治州政协主席李和才（哈尼族）说：“解放前，提起少数民族人们只知道汉、满、蒙古、回、藏，那有人知道哈尼、傈僳、拉祜等等少数民族。解放后，少数民族真是当家作主了，不但能进昆明进北京，全国各地都是自己的家。”他又说：“我坚决拥护邓小平同志的报告，坚持在少数民族地区进行社会主义教育，坚决批判资产阶级民族主义倾向，加强民族间的团结和统一。”怒江傈僳族自治州委员、泸水县副县长段成金（汉族）说：“邓小平同志的报告是适时的，正确的。只有彻底的批判了大汉族主义和地方民族主义，才有利于民族团结。”他说：“社会主义是少数民族摆脱贫苦的唯一道路；少数民族离开共产党领导，离开汉族的帮助，就不能走上社会主义道路。”
