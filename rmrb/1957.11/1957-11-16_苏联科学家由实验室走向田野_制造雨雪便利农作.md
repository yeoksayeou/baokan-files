Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 15th: Soviet scientists are now able to create artificial "clouds" that can produce "rain" indoors, or under normal temperature, pressure, and humidity natural conditions. This was stated recently by Soviet Deputy Doctor of Chemical Sciences, Smirnov, in an article published in the "Young Technology" magazine.

The article said that a small group of scientists, led by Corresponding Member of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, Deryagin, began to solve the problem of creating artificial clouds, rain, and snow not long ago. Under laboratory conditions, they thoroughly studied the effect of radioactive radiation on ordinary atmospheric air. The results proved that, due to extremely complex electrical and radiochemical processes, minute water droplets can be generated in irradiated air. The droplets quickly enlarge, becoming ordinary raindrops.

Smirnov said that this type of experiment is still quite far from being implemented under real natural conditions. However, with the development of modern atomic energy science, it is already possible to start field geophysical research on the impact of radioactive radiation on the atmosphere.

In the article, Smirnov also introduced an experiment by Soviet scientists to make natural clouds, that would not naturally turn into rain, produce rain. Soviet scientist Fedoseyev flew over the Ashkhabad region and used a calcium chloride solution to influence the clouds. As a result, the water droplets in the clouds enlarged, the clouds disintegrated, and rain fell from the clouds. He said that chemical products such as phosphate fertilizer, nitrogen fertilizer, growth stimulants, and trace elements can also be used to influence clouds. This will not only promote rainfall, but the chemical products themselves will also benefit crop growth.

    苏联科学家由实验室走向田野
    制造雨雪便利农作
    新华社莫斯科15日电　苏联科学家现在已经能够在室内，或在正常温度、气压和湿度的自然条件之下，制造可以降“雨”的人造“云”了，这是苏联化学科学副博士斯米尔诺夫最近在“青年技术”杂志上发表的一篇文章中说的。
    文章说，以苏联科学院通讯院士杰里雅金为首的一批人数不多的科学家在不久以前着手解决制造人造的云和雨雪的问题。他们在实验室条件下详尽地研究了放射性辐射对普通的大气层空气的影响。结果证明，由于极复杂的电过程和放射化学过程，在受到辐射的空气中可以产生极微小的水滴，水滴迅速变大，变成通常的雨滴。
    斯米尔诺夫说，这种试验同真正在自然条件下加以实行还有相当距离，然而在现代原子力能学发展的情况下，已经有可能着手从事放射性辐射对大气影响的野外地球物理研究。
    斯米尔诺夫在这篇文章中还介绍了苏联科学家使不会自然变成雨的天然云降雨的一次试验。苏联科学家费多谢耶夫乘飞机飞到阿什哈巴德地区上空，用氯化钙溶液来影响云。结果云里的水滴变大了，云解体了，从云中降下了雨。他说，还可以利用磷肥、氮肥、生长刺激素、微量元素等化学产品来影响云，这样不仅可以促成雨的下降，而且化学产品本身对农作物生长也会有好处。
