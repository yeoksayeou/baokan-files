Xinhua News Agency dispatch: According to an investigation by the Laiyang Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Shandong Province, covering twelve agricultural cooperatives in Heluo Township, Laiyang County: due to increased grain production, 71.3% of the member families now have grain reserves. As long as the work is done well, in another five to six years, all members will be able to store enough surplus grain for one year's consumption, as required by the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft).

Currently, the agricultural cooperatives in this township are educating their members to conserve grain and increase reserves. The Hejiagou Agricultural Cooperative has already decided to establish a grain reserve committee under the leadership of the cooperative committee to mobilize member families to make plans for grain reserves.

Heluo Township has limited land and a large population, with an average of less than 1.8 mu of cultivated land per person. After the collectivization, land yields increased, resulting in surplus grain. Of the 2,405 households in the township, excluding seven individual farmers, 1,709 households now have stored grain, only 77 households lack grain, and the rest have enough to eat but no stored grain. According to an investigation by the working group of the Laiyang Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, since the average grain per person greatly exceeds the three-fixed grain retention standard, there should be even more households with stored grain.

Of the 1,709 households with stored grain, the average stored grain per person is 65 jin. Based on this calculation, each person could have around 400 jin of stored grain in six to seven years. Coupled with the promotion of grain conservation and the development of production, in another five to six years, not only can these households store enough surplus grain for one year's consumption, but other members can also achieve this.

According to the working group's investigation, the obstacles to grain reserves are mainly ideological. Some members have the idea of relying on the cooperative and the state, some are afraid of showing off wealth by storing grain, and some are afraid that they will receive less grain during distribution if they store grain; some even believe that the cooperative has advantages, and there will be enough grain to eat in lean years, so there is no need to store grain for emergencies. Therefore, each cooperative in Heluo Township has decided to strengthen education among members, explaining the importance of conservation and reserves, and promoting that it is glorious to conserve and store grain earned through labor, to advance the work of grain reserves.

### 河洛乡多数社员家有存粮  五、六年内可储备一年余粮

    河洛乡多数社员家有存粮
    五、六年内可储备一年余粮
    新华社讯　据中共山东省莱阳地委对莱阳县河洛乡十二个农业社的调查证明：由于粮食增产，现在有占社员总数71．3％的社员家庭都有存粮。只要把工作作好，再过五年到六年，所有的社员都能按全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）的要求，储备够一年食用的余粮。
    现在，这个乡的农业社都在教育社员节约粮食增加储备。贺家沟农业社已经决定在社委会领导下成立储备粮食委员会，发动社员家家做出储备粮食的计划。
    河洛乡地少人多，每人平均耕地不到一亩八分。合作化以后土地产量提高有了余粮。全乡二千四百零五户中除七户单干农民外，现在有陈粮的达一千七百零九户，缺粮户只有七十七户，其余够吃无陈粮。据中共莱阳地委工作组调查，既然每人平均粮食大大超过了三定留粮标准，有陈粮户应该更多。
    现在有陈粮的一千七百零九户，每人平均有陈粮六十五斤，照此推算六、七年每人就可有四百斤左右陈粮。加上发动节约粮食和生产的发展，再过五、六年不仅这些户可以储备一年食用的余粮，其他的社员也能办到。
    据工作组调查，储备粮食的障碍主要是思想问题。有的社员有依赖社和国家的思想，有的怕存粮露富，有的怕存了粮再分粮时会少分；甚至有的认为合作社有优越性，荒年打粮也够吃，不必存粮备荒。为此，河洛乡各社决定向社员加强教育，说明节约储备的重要性，宣传劳动分得的粮食节约储备是光荣的，推进储备粮食的工作。
