This newspaper Urumqi dispatch: The average yield per unit area of more than 1,710,000 mu of cotton in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region reached 59.52 jin of ginned cotton, exceeding the cotton production target of the first Five-Year Plan by 8.69%. This is Xinjiang's highest cotton yield record in history. More than forty cotton-growing counties have reached the targets of 40, 60, and 80 jin of ginned cotton per mu as stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft). The average yield per mu in Turpan (84 jin) and Shanshan (82.5 jin) counties exceeded 80 jin. The average yield per mu in Toksun (over 71 jin), Moyu, and Makit counties was below 80 jin and above 60 jin. Thirty-eight counties had an average yield per mu below 60 jin and above 40 jin. The main reasons for the record high cotton yield per unit area in the autonomous region this year are the promotion of cotton high-yield experiences and advanced cultivation techniques in recent years, and the use of Soviet improved varieties. The yields of these improved varieties are generally one to two times higher than those of local varieties. Turpan County, where improved varieties are basically popularized, has an average yield of 84 jin of ginned cotton per mu, an increase of 25% over last year. During the entire growth period of cotton, each cotton-growing county generally applied 3,000 to 4,000 jin of stable manure and one to two top dressings. Under the conditions of reducing cotton row spacing and increasing density, early and timely cultivation, deep cultivation, and delayed late cultivation were generally achieved. All counties also promptly prevented and controlled pests, basically achieving the requirements of early treatment, small-scale treatment, and thorough treatment.
    
    According to Xinhua News Agency, Zhejiang Province's average yield of ginned cotton per mu this year is about 75 jin, making it one of China's high-yield cotton provinces. It is estimated that the province's 1,140,000 mu of cotton fields will produce more than 850,000 dan of ginned cotton this year, exceeding the state plan target for the last year of the first Five-Year Plan by 70%.
    
    The cotton-growing areas of Zhejiang Province are distributed around the Hangzhou Bay and along the coast. This year, leaders at all levels have vigorously strengthened their leadership in cotton production and generally promoted excellent varieties. In 1952, the planting area of Dai-character cotton in Zhejiang Province accounted for only 3.86% of the total cotton planting area, while this year the planting area of this variety accounts for more than 85%. In addition, a trend of low-yield areas learning from high-yield areas has formed throughout the province. About 400 cadres and members of agricultural cooperatives from various places went to Cixi County, known as the "Jiangnan Cotton Warehouse," to visit and study. Cixi County also selected a group of members with rich production experience to serve as production instructors in eight counties including Linhai and Sanmen. They imparted technology and helped with production in the fields, which played a significant role in increasing production. For example, Linhai County only harvested 10 jin of ginned cotton per mu in 1952 and only 32 jin last year, but this year it harvested 56 jin.
    
    Due to the bumper cotton harvest, the income of cotton farmers has greatly increased. Now the cotton farmers are selling cotton to the state, repaying loans, and planning to achieve higher production levels in the future.
    
    According to Xinhua News Agency, Cixi County in Zhejiang Province has reached the production increase target of 100 jin of cotton required by the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) this year. The county's 488,000 mu of cotton fields have an average yield of 109 jin of ginned cotton per mu.
    
    This year, Cixi County has focused on four aspects in cotton production: fertilizer, water conservancy, pest control, and soil improvement. Agricultural cooperatives throughout the county have basically used advanced technologies such as "green manure burial," "fertilization based on seedling observation," and "heavy application of bud fertilizer" to better exert the effectiveness of fertilizer. Many agricultural cooperatives have switched to deep-ditch and high-ridge systems to improve drainage conditions. The county has also dug an 80-li long river to lower the groundwater level to facilitate the growth of cotton taproots. "1059" pesticides are used for pest control. All of these have greatly encouraged farmers and promoted increased cotton production.
    
    According to the person in charge of the Cixi County Committee of the Communist Party of China, Cixi County still has great potential to tap in cotton production. This year, more than 3,000 mu of cotton fields in the county yielded more than 160 jin of ginned cotton per mu, and more than 220,000 mu of cotton fields yielded 100 jin to 140 jin of ginned cotton per mu, but more cotton fields still only yielded 70 jin to 90 jin per mu. The conditions of these cotton fields are similar, which shows that the potential for increasing production is still great. Based on this situation, the county's plan for 1958 is to achieve an average yield of 122 jin of ginned cotton per mu.

    四十多个县达到纲要指标
    新疆棉花产量创历年最高纪录
    浙江全省亩产皮棉七十五斤
    本报乌鲁木齐电　新疆维吾尔自治区一百七十一万多亩棉花平均单位面积产量达五十九点五二斤皮棉，超额8．69％完成第一个五年计划的棉花产量指标，这是新疆历年最高棉产量纪录。其中有四十多个植棉县产量已分别达到全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）规定的亩产皮棉四十、六十、八十斤的指标。每亩平均产量在八十斤以上的有吐鲁番（八十四斤）和鄯善（八十二点五斤）二县，每亩平均产量在八十斤以下，六十斤以上的有托克逊（七十一斤多）、墨玉、麦盖提县，每亩平均产量在六十斤以下、四十斤以上的有三十八个县。今年，自治区棉花单位面积产量获得历史最高纪录的主要原因是几年来推广了棉花丰产经验和先进耕作栽培技术，采用了苏联良种。这些良种产量一般均较土种提高一到二倍，基本上普及良种的吐鲁番县平均每亩产皮棉八十四斤，比去年增产25％。各植棉县在棉花整个生长期中，一般施厩肥三至四千斤，追肥一至二次。在缩小棉花行距、加大密度的情况下，一般做到了早中耕、及时中耕和深中耕以及延迟后期中耕。各县还及时地防治了虫害，基本上做到了治早、治小、治了的要求。
    据新华社讯　浙江省今年平均每亩棉田产皮棉七十五斤左右，成为我国棉花高额丰产省之一。全省一百一十四万亩棉田，预计今年可产皮棉八十五万担以上，超额70％完成第一个五年计划最后一年的国家计划指标。
    浙江省的棉区分布在杭州湾口和沿海一带。今年各级领导大力加强了对棉花生产的领导，普遍推广优良品种。在1952年的时候，浙江省的岱字棉种植面积只占全部植棉面积的3．86％，而今年这个品种的种植面积占到了85％以上。另外，全省已经形成了一个低产地区向高产地区学习的风气。各地约有四百个干部和农业社社员到素称“江南棉仓”的慈溪县去参观学习。慈溪县也选拔了一批具有丰富生产经验的社员到临海、三门等八个县去担任生产辅导员。他们在当地传授技术，下地帮助生产，对增产起了很大作用。如临海县1952年每亩只收皮棉十斤，去年也只收三十二斤，而今年收到了五十六斤。
    由于棉花丰收，棉农收入大大增加。现在棉农们正在把棉花出售给国家，归还贷款，规划在今后达到更高的生产水平。
    据新华社讯　浙江省慈溪县今年已经达到全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）所要求的百斤棉的增产指标，全县四十八万八千亩棉田，平均每亩产皮棉一百零九斤。
    慈溪县今年在棉花生产中突出地抓住了肥料、水利、治虫、改良土壤等四个方面。全县农业社基本上都运用“草子青葬”、“看苗施肥”、“重施蕾肥”等先进技术，更好地发挥肥效。许多农业社改用深沟高畦来改善排水条件。全县还开掘了一条八十里长的河道来降低地下水位，以利棉花主根的生长。采用“一○五九”农药治虫。这些都大大鼓舞了农民，促进了棉花的增产。
    据中共慈溪县委负责人谈，慈溪县棉花生产还有很大潜力可挖。今年全县有三千多亩棉田亩产皮棉一百六十多斤，有二十二万多亩棉田亩产皮棉一百斤到一百四十斤，但是较多的棉田每亩产量还只有七十斤到九十斤。这些棉田条件相差不多，可见增产潜力还是很大的。根据这一情况，全县1958年的规划是，使平均每亩产量达到皮棉一百二十二斤。
