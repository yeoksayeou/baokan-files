In the anti-Rightist battlefront

Former *Dazhong Daily* Editor-in-Chief Counterrevolutionary, Arrogant, Degenerate, and Traitor to the Party
Liu Jian Attempted to Turn the Party Newspaper into an Anti-Party Newspaper

(Reported by this newspaper) All staff members of the Shandong *Dazhong Daily* recently held a meeting to expose and criticize the anti-Party and anti-socialist crimes of Liu Jian, the former editor-in-chief of the newspaper, member of the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, traitor to the Party, and ultra-Rightist.

Using "mass character" and "interest" as excuses to oppose the class character and guiding nature of the Party newspaper, he incited editors and reporters to say things that the Central Committee had not said.

Liu Jian attempted to篡改 (cuan gai) the political direction of the Party newspaper with a bourgeois newspaper management program. Using his so-called "mass character" and "interest" as excuses, he opposed the class character, guiding nature, and Party spirit of the Party newspaper. He vehemently opposed the *Dazhong Daily* publishing instructions from the Party and government, work experiences, and reports from responsible comrades. He also viciously opposed articles explaining Marxism-Leninism and reports on the life of the Party. He was extremely interested in exposing the "dark side" of society, demanding that the Party newspaper staff comprehensively expose the "dark side" of socialist society, and regarding this as a standard for "intellectual liveliness." He viciously incited the newspaper editorial staff to say things that the Central Committee and the Provincial Party Committee had not said, believing that following what the Central Committee and the Provincial Party Committee had said was dogmatism.

Liu Jian greatly admired the reactionary journalistic views of the Rightist Wang Zhong, considering him a thoughtful and knowledgeable person.

Even more egregious, he even smeared the *Dazhong Daily*, the organ of the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, as being less able to connect with the masses than bourgeois newspapers. He said: "We are now detached from the masses, detached from the urban masses, and have not grasped the rural masses... but bourgeois newspapers can closely connect with the masses..."

Demanding that the Provincial Party Committee abandon its leadership over the newspaper, refusing to publish important manuscripts designated by the Provincial Party Committee.

Starting from a bourgeois viewpoint and position on newspaper management, Liu Jian vehemently opposed the Party's leadership over the newspaper. When responsible comrades of the Provincial Party Committee asked him to publish the Provincial Party Committee's supplementary instructions on rural work in the newspaper, he expressed his disagreement. When responsible comrades of the Provincial Party Committee brought back two important manuscripts from the Linyi Prefectural Committee and instructed that they be published in the newspaper, he openly returned the manuscripts, refusing to publish them. During the grassroots elections last winter, when responsible comrades of the Provincial Party Committee wanted the newspaper to reprint the People's Daily editorial and the State Council's notice, and to publish Vice Governor Yang Xuanwu's report on "Ensuring the Success of Grassroots Election Work," he refused twice by telephone. He believed that the meeting where the Provincial Party Committee conveyed the resolutions of the Second Plenary Session had no "new" content and was not prepared to publish it. Only after the Provincial Party Committee questioned and criticized him did he reluctantly use the Xinhua News Agency稿 (gao).

During the Great Blooming and Great Contending, Liu Jian's reactionary views and arrogance reached an unprecedented level. He believed that the Provincial Party Committee was wrong and he was right, that the Provincial Party Committee was an amateur and he was an expert. He arrogantly demanded that the Provincial Party Committee break away from its relationship with the newspaper, openly proposing the idea of running two newspapers. He also instructed the editorial departments to convene座谈会 (zuo tan hui) for grassroots masses such as workers, students, handicraftsmen, and suburban farmers, and wanted to send reporters to various prefectural committees to collect "opinions" on the Provincial Party Committee, believing that this would promote the Provincial Party Committee's determination to "change."

Preparing to hire reactionary old newspapermen as consultants, advocating exchanging two county-level cadres for one university student.

In order to realize his reactionary newspaper management program, Liu Jian vehemently vilified the Party's cadre policy. He proposed hiring "old newspapermen" (i.e., those who ran reactionary newspapers during the Kuomintang and enemy-puppet rule) as "consultants" for the *Dazhong Daily* to revise important articles and handle headlines. To this end, he sought help from the Rightist Wang Zhong, writing a letter asking Wang Zhong to actively find such people for him in Shanghai. At the same time, he told another Rightist in the newspaper's editorial department to look for them in Jinan City.

He also took a negative attitude towards the old cadres of the newspaper from the bourgeois viewpoint of "talent only" and "literati running newspapers," opposing the Party's cadre policy of both ability and integrity. He tried his best to exaggerate the shortcomings of certain old cadres in terms of writing skills, attempting to squeeze them out. Liu Jian repeatedly proposed "exchanging county-level cadres for university students; if one is not enough, exchange two for one." Liu Jian expressed his unease that some bourgeois intellectuals in the editorial department who had not been transformed or had not been thoroughly transformed had not been promoted to leadership positions, believing that this was "sectarianism," burying their talents and learning and affecting their enthusiasm.

In order to completely eliminate the reactionary influence of the traitor Liu Jian, all the staff members of the *Dazhong Daily* are continuing to expose and criticize his crimes in depth.

    前大众日报总编辑反动狂妄堕落叛党
    刘建企图把党报办成反党的报纸
    本报讯　山东大众日报社全体工作人员，近日举行大会，揭发与批判该报前总编辑、中共山东省委委员、党的叛徒和极右派分子刘建反党反社会主义罪行。
    借口“群众性”“兴趣性”反对党报的阶级性、指导性，煽动编辑记者说中央没有说过的话
    刘建企图用资产阶级办报纲领，来篡改党报的政治方向。他借口自己的所谓“群众性”、“兴趣性”，来反对党报的阶级性、指导性和党性原则。他极力反对大众日报刊登党和政府的指示、工作经验和负责同志的报告等。他还恶毒地反对阐释马克思列宁主义的文章及党的生活的报道。他对揭露社会“黑暗面”兴趣极浓，要求党报工作人员全面的揭露社会主义社会“黑暗面”，并以此为“思想活泼”的标准。他恶毒地煽动报纸编辑部工作人员，要说中央、省委没有说过的话，他认为按照中央、省委说过的话说，就是教条主义。
    刘建极为赞赏右派分子王中的反动新闻观点，认为他是有思想有学问的人。
    更为恶劣的是，他竟污蔑作为中共山东省委机关报的大众日报还不如资产阶级报纸能联系群众。他说：“我们现在脱离了群众，脱离了城市的群众，也没有抓住农村群众。……但资产阶级的报纸却能密切联系群众，……
    要求省委放弃对报纸的领导，拒绝刊登省委指定的重要稿件
    刘建从资产阶级办报观点和立场出发，极力反对党对报纸的领导。省委负责同志让他在报纸上刊载省委关于农村工作的补充指示，他表示不同意；省委负责同志从临沂地委带回两件重要稿子，指示在报纸上登载，他公然将稿件退回，拒不刊登；去年冬季进行基层选举时，省委负责同志要报纸随同转载人民日报有关社论和国务院的通知，登载杨宣武副省长关于“保证做好基层选举工作”的报告，他两次打电话加以拒绝；省委传达二中全会决议的会议，他认为没有“新”内容，不准备登报，经省委提出质问和指责后，他才勉强用了新华社稿。
    在大放大鸣期间，刘建的反动观点和气焰嚣张到了无以复加的程度。他认为省委错了他对了，省委是外行他是内行，他狂妄地要求省委摆脱与报纸的关系，公然提出办两张报纸的主张。他还布置编辑部各部召开工人、学生、手工业者、郊区农民等基层群众的座谈会，并想派出记者到各地委搜集对省委的“意见”，他认为这样才能促进省委“改”的决心。
    准备聘请反动的老报人当顾问，主张用两个县级干部换一个大学生
    为了实现其反动的办报纲领，刘建极力诋毁党的干部政策。他提出要聘请“老报人”（即在国民党和敌伪统治时期办过反动报纸的人）做大众日报的“顾问”，由他来修改重要文章和处理标题。为此，他求助于右派分子王中，写信要求王中在上海为他积极物色；同时，还告诉本报编辑部另一右派分子在济南市寻找。
    他还从资产阶级“唯才论”和“文人办报”的观点出发，对报社老干部采取否定的态度，反对党的德才兼备的干部政策。他尽力扩大某些老干部在文字水平方面的缺陷，企图把他们排挤出去。刘建曾屡次提出“用县级干部换大学生，如果一个不行，用两个换一个。”刘建对编辑部某些未经改造或未经彻底改造的资产阶级知识分子没被提拔到领导岗位上去表示不安，认为这就是“宗派主义”，埋没了他们的才学、影响了他们的积极性。
    为了彻底消除叛徒刘建的反动影响，大众日报全体工作人员对他的罪行，正继续深入揭发和批判。
