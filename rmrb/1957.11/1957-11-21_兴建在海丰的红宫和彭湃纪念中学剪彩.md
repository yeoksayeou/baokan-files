Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 19th: A grand ribbon-cutting ceremony was held on the 19th for the Red Palace and Peng Pai Memorial Middle School, built in Haifeng County.

The ribbon-cutting ceremony for the Red Palace was presided over by Gu Dacun, Secretary of the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee. Before the ribbon-cutting, the Third Secretary of the Huiyang Prefectural Party Committee delivered a speech. He said that thirty years ago, this building was the center of the Hailufeng Soviet activities, and many regional representative meetings were held here to decide how to carry out armed struggles against landlords, gentry, and reactionaries, and liberate the working people. He called on everyone to inherit the legacy of the martyrs and actively build a socialist motherland under the leadership of the Communist Party.

In November 1927, the Hailufeng Soviet government was established in Haifeng County. From then on, this palace-style Confucius Temple began to be renamed the Red Palace. After the failure of the Hailufeng Soviet regime, the Red Palace was severely damaged. Last year, the government allocated funds to rebuild the Red Palace, making it even more magnificent today than before. The Red Palace displays more than 260 revolutionary relics, including the blood-stained clothes of the martyrs, the knives and guns used by the martyrs, as well as the bullets taken from the martyrs and the shackles buried underground with the martyrs.

On the 19th, more than 700 representatives from more than a dozen counties in eastern Guangdong and many citizens of Haifeng County came to visit the Red Palace. Among the visitors were the mother of martyr Peng Pai and many other relatives and comrades-in-arms of the martyrs.

The Peng Pai Memorial Middle School, built on the site of the former Haifeng County Middle School where Peng Pai studied in his youth, is a complete middle school. More than 1,400 students who have just moved into the new school building have expressed their determination to learn from the spirit of Peng Pai's sharing weal and woe with the peasants, and to cultivate themselves into cultured laborers.

    兴建在海丰的红宫和彭湃纪念中学剪彩
    新华社广州19日电　兴建在海丰县城的红宫和彭湃纪念中学，19日隆重举行了剪彩典礼。
    红宫剪彩典礼由中共广东省委书记古大存主持。剪彩以前，中共惠阳地委第三书记讲了话。他说，三十年前，这座建筑物是海陆丰苏维埃活动的中心，曾在这里召开过许多区域性的代表会议，决定怎样和地主豪绅反动派进行武装斗争，解放劳动人民。他号召大家要继承先烈的遗志，在共产党领导下积极建设社会主义祖国。
    1927年11月，海丰县城成立海陆丰苏维埃政府，从那时起，这个宫殿式的孔庙就开始改名为红宫。海陆丰苏维埃政权失败后，红宫也随之遭到了严重破坏。去年政府拨款重新修建红宫，使它今天比从前更加辉煌壮丽。红宫里面陈列着二百六十多件革命文物，其中有烈士的血衣，烈士用过的刀枪，还有从烈士身上取出的子弹和同烈士一起埋在地下的脚镣。
    19日粤东十多个县的七百多位代表和许多海丰县市民来到红宫参观。在参观者的行列中，有彭湃烈士的母亲及其他许多烈士的亲人和战友。
    建筑在彭湃烈士青年时代读过书的原海丰县立中学旧址上的彭湃纪念中学，是一所完全中学。刚搬进新校舍的一千四百多名学生，都表示要学习彭湃烈士与农民同甘共苦的精神，把自己培养成有文化的劳动者。
