Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 8th November: "Pravda" wrote in an editorial on the 8th, entitled "Towards the Victory of Communism," that the grand celebrations in the Soviet Union and around the world of the fortieth anniversary of the Great October Revolution powerfully demonstrate the growing strength of peace, democracy, and socialism, and the further unity of millions of working people under the banner of proletarian internationalism.

The editorial said that the fortieth anniversary of the October Revolution is a significant and glorious festival for the people of all nationalities in the Soviet Union, the working people of all socialist countries, the international working class, and all of progressive humanity.

The heroic Russian working class, allied with the working peasantry and led by the immortal Lenin and the Communist Party, completed the proletarian revolution and established the world's first socialist state. Their achievements will be forever remembered in the hearts of the people.

Now everyone can see the great leap our motherland has made from backwardness to progress in the years of Soviet power, how vigorously its material and spiritual strength has grown, and the height science and technology have reached. The Soviet Union is now a great industrial and collective agricultural socialist power, a free alliance of free nations, an unbreakable pillar of world peace, and a beacon and hope for all of working humanity. The tremendous achievements of the creative labor of the Soviet people and the collective heroism they displayed during the years of cruel war prove what miracles the working people can create when they manage the country themselves and solve the historical destiny of the country themselves.

The editorial said that in the report made by Khrushchev, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the CPSU, at the celebration meeting of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union in Moscow on the 6th, he summarized the historically significant victories achieved by the Soviet people under the leadership of the Communist Party and pointed out the inspiring prospects for our country's communist construction. The leaders of the parties and governments of the socialist countries delivered exciting congratulatory messages in a sincere and friendly atmosphere. This celebration meeting once again demonstrated that the alliance between the working class and the collective farmers and the friendship of the people of all nationalities in our country are unbreakable, and once again demonstrated that they are closely united around the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, which is the soul and mind of the entire creative activity of the Soviet people. The military parade and the march of the working people held in Moscow and other cities of the Soviet Union on the 7th vividly proved that the Soviet people are unswervingly fighting for the victorious implementation of the resolutions of the 20th Congress of the CPSU.

The editorial concluded by saying that the Soviet state is full of vigor and endless creativity as it enters its fifth decade. With firm and deep confidence in a bright future, our people are advancing towards the victory of communism under the banner of Lenin and under the leadership of the Communist Party.

    走向共产主义的胜利
    苏联“真理报”八日社论（摘要）
    新华社8日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：“真理报”8日在题为“走向共产主义的胜利”的社论中写道，苏联和世界各地庆祝伟大的十月革命四十周年的盛况，有力地显示了不断增长的和平、民主和社会主义的力量，显示了千百万劳动人民在无产阶级国际主义的旗帜下进一步的团结。
    社论说，十月革命四十周年是苏联各族人民、各社会主义国家的劳动人民、国际工人阶级和整个进步人类的重大和光辉的节日。
    英勇的俄国工人阶级同劳动农民结成联盟，在以不朽的列宁为首的共产党领导下完成无产阶级革命，建立了世界上第一个社会主义国家，他们的功绩将在人们的心中永志不忘。
    现在大家都看到，我们祖国在苏维埃政权的年代里从落后向进步跃进了多么大的一步，它的物质和精神力量是多么蓬勃地增长起来，科学技术达到了何等的高度。苏联现在是伟大的工业——集体农业的社会主义大国，是自由民族的自由联盟，是世界和平牢不可破的支柱，是整个劳动人类的灯塔和希望。苏联人创造性劳动的巨大成绩和他们在残酷战争的考验年代里所表现出的集体英雄主义证明，劳动人民只要亲自管理国家，亲自解决国家的历史命运，他们就能够创造出什么样的奇迹来。
    社论说，苏共中央第一书记赫鲁晓夫6日在莫斯科举行的苏联最高苏维埃庆祝大会上所作的报告里，总结了苏联人民在共产党领导下所取得的具有历史意义的胜利，指明了我国共产主义建设的令人鼓舞的远景。社会主义国家的党和政府代表的领导人在真诚友好和诚恳的气氛中发表了激动人心的贺词。这次庆祝大会再一次表明了工人阶级同集体农民的联盟和我国各族人民的友谊是牢不可破的，再次表明了他们是紧密地团结在作为苏联人民整个创造活动的灵魂和头脑的苏联共产党的周围。而7日在莫斯科以及苏联其他城市举行的阅兵和劳动人民的游行，鲜明地证明了苏联人毫不动摇地在为胜利实现苏共第二十次代表大会的决议而奋斗。
    社论最后说，苏维埃国家充满着蓬勃的力量和无穷尽的创造力进入它的第五个十年。我国人民怀着对光辉的未来的坚定的和深厚的信心，在列宁的旗帜下和共产党的领导下朝着共产主义的胜利前进。
