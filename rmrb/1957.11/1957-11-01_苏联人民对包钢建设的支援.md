    Soviet People's Support for Baogang Construction
    Yang Wei, Manager of Baotou Iron and Steel Company
    As people all over the world joyfully celebrate the fortieth anniversary of the great October Revolution, we recall the construction of Baogang over the past few years. Only under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, following the path of the October Revolution, and after a long period of arduous and victorious struggle, could the Chinese people build such a large-scale iron and steel complex—Baogang—on this windy and sandy, cold, and industrially extremely backward Inner Mongolian minority area with inconvenient transportation and a sparse population. The Soviet comrades who participated in the construction of Baogang not only had a high level of technical expertise but also had the same enthusiasm as if they were working in their own country. When it was discovered that the Baiyun Ebo iron ore had a relatively high fluorine content and contained a large number of other metallic substances, we encountered many difficulties because our technical cadres had no experience in smelting such ore. However, Comrade I. P. Shomik, who was then teaching at the Northeast Institute of Technology, readily agreed to our request. He not only helped us solve technical problems in theory but also, despite his illness, went from Shenyang to the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant in Beijing to directly guide the experimental operations and lead our technical cadres in preparing the experimental report. When Baogang was preparing the design task book and selecting the plant site, we also could not confirm the plant site or prepare the design task book because of our insufficient technical and economic experience. It was not until the factory site selection team led by Belyanchikov and Andreyev came to China that they helped us solve the technical and economic difficulties we encountered, prepared the design task book, and selected the plant site. Comrade Andreyev made extremely valuable suggestions to us on how to prepare for the construction of an iron and steel complex in the Baotou area, such as when railways, highways, and thermal power plants needed to be built, how to organize the construction base, and how to allocate construction cadres and workers. Today, these suggestions all prove to be correct. All the Soviet experts who participated in the construction of Baogang, both those mentioned above and those not mentioned, enthusiastically imparted their advanced technical experience to the Chinese comrades who worked with them. Some experts worked in Baogang for a relatively short time, and when they were about to leave, they expressed regret that they could not impart more of their advanced technology to their Chinese comrades. This is filled with the deep, unbreakable, and great friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people.
    The entire design staff of the Leningrad Branch of the Black Metallurgical Design Institute, headed by Chief Engineer Andreyev, adopted the latest technological achievements of the Soviet steel industry in the design for Baogang. The steelmaking plant adopted world-class large open-hearth furnaces, used oxygen steelmaking, vaporized cooling, and was equipped with waste heat boilers to utilize waste heat. All rolling mills were fully mechanized and automated and had interlocking devices. The central laboratory was equipped with new laboratories such as an isotope testing laboratory, an ultra-high-speed flaw detection laboratory, and a spectral qualitative and quantitative testing laboratory. All these new equipment, including several rolling mills and open-hearth furnaces, were manufactured by the Soviet Union and supplied to us. This reflects the selfless assistance of the Soviet Communist Party and government to China's socialist industrial construction, and also reflects the tremendous achievements made by the Soviet people in socialist and communist construction under the leadership of the Soviet Communist Party in the forty years since the October Revolution.
    When celebrating the fortieth anniversary of the great October Revolution, all the staff and workers of Baogang, in addition to expressing their heartfelt gratitude for the Soviet Union's selfless assistance to our economic construction, also deeply appreciate the infinite vitality of Marxism-Leninism and the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system. We must celebrate the fortieth anniversary of this great October Revolution, which opened a new era for mankind, with great enthusiasm. We must more consciously study Marxism-Leninism, resolutely engage in socialist construction under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and build Baogang diligently and thriftily.

    苏联人民对包钢建设的支援
    包头钢铁公司经理　杨维
    值此全世界人民欢欣鼓舞地庆祝伟大的十月革命四十周年之际，我们回想起了包钢几年的建设。中国人民只有在中国共产党领导下，沿着十月革命的道路，进行了长期的艰苦的胜利斗争，才能在这风砂大、气候寒冷的塞外，工业极端落后，交通不便，人口稀少的内蒙古少数民族地区，平地建设这样大规模的钢铁联合企业——包钢。参加包钢建设的苏联同志们，不仅是有相当高的技术水平，而且有着像在他们的祖国工作一样的热情。在发现白云鄂博铁矿内含氟比较高和含有大量的其他金属物的时候，由于我们的技术干部对冶炼这样的矿石没有经验，遇到很多困难。但是当时在东北工学院任教的伊·彼·萧米克同志，慨然答应我们的请求，不仅在理论上帮助我们解决技术问题，而且带病由沈阳到北京石景山钢铁厂直接指导试验操作，领导我们的技术干部作出试验报告。在包钢编制设计任务书和选择厂址时，也因为我们技术经济的经验不够，不能肯定厂址，不能编制出设计任务书。直到别良齐可夫、安德列也夫率领的选厂址组来到中国，才帮助我们解决了所遇到的技术经济上的困难，编制了设计任务书，选定了厂址。安德列也夫同志对在包头地区建设钢铁联合企业如何进行准备工作，向我们提出了极宝贵的建议，如铁路、公路、热电站需要在何时建设，建筑基地如何组织，建设干部与工人如何调备等问题，今天看都是正确的。上面所提到以及没有提到的凡参加过包钢建设的苏联专家，都很热情地把他们先进的技术经验传授给同他们一起工作的中国同志。有的专家在包钢工作时间比较短，在临别时还向我们表示没能更多的把他所学的先进技术传授给中国同志是件憾事。这中间充满了中苏两国人民深厚的牢不可破的伟大友谊。
    黑色冶金设计院列宁格勒分院以安德列也夫总工程师为首的全体设计人员在给包钢设计中采用了苏联钢铁工业上最新的技术成果，炼钢厂采用了世界第一流的大平炉，使用氧气炼钢，汽化冷却，并设有含热锅炉，以利用余热；几套轧钢机全部机械化自动化并有联锁装置；中央化验室设有同位素检验室，超高速探伤检验室，光谱定质定量检验室等新试验室。以上这些新设备，包括几套轧钢机、平炉等都由苏联制造供给我们。这一方面反映了苏联共产党与政府对中国社会主义工业建设的无私援助，同时也反映了十月革命后四十年来苏联人民在苏联共产党领导下，在社会主义与共产主义建设方面取得的巨大成就。
    包钢全体职工在这庆祝伟大的十月革命四十周年时，除了衷心地感谢苏联无私的援助我国经济建设外，还深刻体会到马克思列宁主义的无限活力，社会主义制度无比的优越性。我们要以极大的热诚庆祝这开辟人类新纪元的伟大十月革命的四十周年，要更自觉的学习马克思列宁主义，坚决在党中央、毛主席领导下，积极地进行社会主义建设，勤俭建设包钢。
