Xinhua News Agency, New York, November 17th: The U.S. Federal Reserve Board announced on the 15th that the U.S. industrial production level in October fell to its lowest point in fifteen months.

    The Board's seasonally adjusted index showed that the industrial production index for October was 142 (with the average from 1947 to 1949 as 100), a decrease of two points from September, three points from August, and four points lower than October of last year. The industrial production level has never been this low since the U.S. steel strike in July of last year caused the production index to fall to 136.

    This indicator reflects the actual output of U.S. manufacturing, mining, and factories, and is unrelated to any changes in price levels. The most drastic production reductions were in industries such as steel, machinery manufacturing, automobiles, furniture, television, and construction equipment. Overall, the current operating rate for manufacturing is only 82%.

    In October, U.S. worker employment, retail sales, bank loans, and stock market prices also declined.

    Regarding corporate investment, McGraw-Hill Publishing Company, after conducting a preliminary survey of corporate plans, determined that investment in new enterprises and equipment may decrease by 7% next year compared to this year's amount, which would be the first reduction in corporate investment in four years.

    According to United Press, the U.S. Federal Reserve Board had already reduced the bank discount rate from 3.5% to 3% on the 14th to give the "economy another psychological boost and increase business confidence." At the same time, U.S. government leaders continue to propose increasing military spending in order to use "more cannons" as another stimulus for economic activity.

    美国工业生产急降
    十月份水平降到十五个月来最低点
    新华社17日讯　纽约消息：美国联邦储备委员会15日宣布，美国工业生产水平在10月份下降到十五个月来的最低点。
    委员会的季节调整指标表明，10月份的工业生产指数是一四二（以1947年到1949年的平均数为一百），这比9月份下降了二点，比8月份跌下三点，比去年10月份低四点。自从去年7月份美国钢铁大罢工使生产指数下降到一三六以来，工业生产水平从来没有这样低。
    这个指标反映了美国制造业、矿山和工厂的实际产量，同任何变化的价格水平无关。生产减少得最剧烈的是钢铁、机器制造、汽车、家具、电视和建筑器材等行业。而整个说来，制造业目前的开工率只有82％。
    在10月份，美国的工人就业、商品零售、银行借款和股票行市也都下降了。
    在企业投资方面，据麦克格劳—希尔出版公司在对企业计划进行了初步调查后断定，明年对新企业和新设备的投资可能比今年的数额减少7％，这将是四年以来企业投资第一次的削减。
    据合众社说，美国联邦储备局14日已经把银行贴现率从3．5％降到3％，以给予“经济另一次心理上的振作和提高企业的信心”。同时，美国政府领导人不断提出要增加军费，以便用“更多的大炮”来作为经济活动的另一刺激。
