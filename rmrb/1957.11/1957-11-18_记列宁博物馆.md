    A Visit to the Lenin Museum
    Wu Boxiao
    Early in the morning, I came out of the hotel and walked alone on the streets of Moscow. I didn't know anyone, but I didn't feel lonely or strange. From the vivid scenes in movies, from the detailed descriptions in literature, and especially from the burning aspirations of decades, I felt as if I had long been familiar with Moscow. The Soviet people I encountered on the street that day, whether male, female, old, or young, whether walking towards me or passing by, all seemed like old friends and neighbors. They welcomed and greeted you with kind eyes and pleasant faces. They seemed to be saying, "Good morning!" "Hello! Guest of the Soviets." My Russian is limited, so I couldn't speak Soviet fluently, but my sincere feelings encouraged me to give a silent reply to each and every one of them: "Hello, comrade!" And I further wanted to tell them (even though they might not ask you): "I'm going to the Lenin Museum."
    The air that day was humid and not cold. Although it was October at almost sixty degrees north latitude, it didn't feel like winter at all. Judging from the light steps of the pedestrians and the joy in my own heart, it felt a bit like early spring. Listening to the chimes of the Kremlin, ding-dong... ding-dong..., my heart immediately opened up like an ocean, pregnant with enthusiasm and full of strength. The chimes were rounded, loud, solemn, and harmonious, like a signal of peace and prosperity, and also like a call to strive forward. In such chimes, I walked into the Lenin Museum.
    Walking into the Lenin Museum is like walking into an international family. It was both quiet and lively there. From the different skin colors of the people and the different languages they spoke, I knew that everyone came from many different countries. Many people exchanged thoughts and feelings not only by speaking, but a slight smile or a gentle nod seemed to imply mutual understanding. Isn't the word "Lenin" the most resounding international language? Its rich connotation is not just the name of a great teacher admired by the world, but already the embodiment of "friend," "comrade," "class friendship and solidarity," and "world peace and happiness."
    With a reverent heart, I followed the endless stream of people through sixteen exhibition rooms. The exhibition rooms displayed either photos and oil paintings of Lenin's revolutionary activities, or mementos and relics belonging to Lenin. From Lenin's childhood to the final farewell of the world's working people to him, people seemed to have lived through Lenin's fighting life. It was such a great yet ordinary life.
    After graduating from middle school with a gold medal, Lenin entered Kazan University. There, he joined a student group that the Tsar's secret police described as "extremely dangerous." With revolutionary zeal, he organized students' revolutionary activities. Because he had read Chernyshevsky's novel "What Is to Be Done?" and the works of democratic poets such as Herzen and Nekrasov when he was fourteen or fifteen years old, Lenin was known among the students for his erudition. An oil painting depicts the scene of seventeen-year-old Lenin leading young students in the struggle against the "University Charter of 1884": He held his head high, his eyes looking far ahead, taking big steps, and a group of young students followed him closely, advancing bravely... It was not yet an armed struggle, but it already gave people a sense of perseverance, decisiveness, and combativeness. According to records, when Lenin was arrested, the police chief escorting him said, "Young man, why do you want to rebel? There is a wall in front of you!" Lenin's reply was: "It is a decaying wall, it will collapse with just a push."
    Under the circumstances of the Tsar's pursuit and wanted notice, and with the constant danger to his life, Lenin fled from the country to abroad, and then fled back to the country from abroad. No hardship could stop him. Wherever he went, he established revolutionary organizations and spread revolutionary seeds. In prison, he avoided the surveillance of the prison guards and engaged in revolutionary writing. "On Strikes" was written in prison. In order to keep secrets, Lenin used milk to write his letters and manuscripts in the spaces between the lines of books.
    In February 1897, Lenin was exiled to remote Siberia, living in the village of Shushenskoye in the Minusinsk district of Yeniseysk province. It was a village in the wilderness, with no trees, only a few filthy streets filled with dung. But during his three years of exile there, Lenin wrote more than thirty works, the famous "The Development of Capitalism in Russia" being one of them. In the intervals of intense work, Lenin also hunted, played chess, skated, took long trips, and read his favorite writers: Pushkin and Lermontov. Lenin was the most capable of working, the most capable of resting, and the most full of life's pleasures.
    Abroad, Lenin also carried out tireless revolutionary activities. The "Iskra" (Spark) newspaper published in Munich, Germany (the first issue was published on December 11, 1900), and the "Zarya" (Dawn) magazine were the all-Russian newspapers and magazines he founded. In the fourth exhibition room, the furnishings of Lenin's residence in Geneva from 1903 to 1904 are displayed. There is also the table used when running the "Iskra" newspaper. In the fifth exhibition room, there is a model of the underground printing house from 1903 to 1906. From the shelter house on the ground and the winding underground passages, one can fully imagine the dangers and hardships of the secret revolutionary work at that time.
    Moving forward, the glorious scene of Razliv unfolds: the historically significant grass shed, the birch forest, the boat on the lake, and the close meeting of two great minds on the shore all leave an indelible impression on people. Lenin was working in the depths of the jungle at that time (July to August 1917). In the center of the jungle, a clearing was made, and two tree stumps were erected, one higher to serve as a table and the other shorter to serve as a stool. Surrounded by branches, Lenin called it the "green office." It was in such an office that Lenin wrote his brilliant work "State and Revolution." For the convenience of work, Lenin shaved off his beard, put on Finnish-style peasant clothes, and took a boat to Razliv to cut grass, or secretly gathered in the grass shed with close comrades-in-arms Sverdlov and Dzerzhinsky. A thirteen-year-old boy named Kolya collected pine branches every day, lit a bonfire to make tea for Lenin, and watched the surroundings at the same time. When he encountered strangers, he would whistle and imitate the call of a nightingale. These should all be immortal pages in the annals of the socialist revolution.
    Disguised as a stoker, he took a locomotive to Finland. Two months later, on November 7th, he gave a speech at an extraordinary meeting of the Petrograd Soviet, shouting: "Long live the world socialist revolution!" On the same day, at 10:45 pm, he announced at Smolny Palace, "All state power belongs to the Soviets,"... Those scenes filled with thunderous applause and tidal waves of cheers are familiar to everyone and remembered by everyone. Our frequent cheers of "Hurrah" and "Long live" can be imagined as continuations of those grand and intense scenes. In the quiet museum, when you visit the oil paintings of large-scale mass scenes, doesn't it seem like you can still hear the cheers clearly from a not-so-distant place? We might as well imagine ourselves as members of those mass gatherings.
    Distributed in three exhibition rooms are three sets of Lenin's clothes: a wool overcoat from 1918, with a black velvet collar and two rows of buttons; a coat with a black sheepskin collar, paired with a pair of felt boots; and a set of drab gray Lenin suit and a pair of coarsely made high-top black leather shoes. These are all very ordinary clothes, but they were all worn by Lenin. Respecting the person who wears the clothes, the clothes also seem to shine. There is also the small desk that was often placed in Lenin's bedroom, the sofa chair with a wide cloth cover that Lenin sat on when talking to peasant representatives, the photograph taken with Gorky... The original objects are quietly and silently displayed there, but each souvenir seems to be giving a personal account, vying to tell visitors the fascinating stories of their time with Lenin.
    The end of the tour is the screening of a documentary about Lenin. Through the film, people directly meet Lenin. Lenin's way of walking, Lenin's voice, Lenin's kind and incredibly firm attitude towards people are irreplaceable and will forever live in people's hearts.
    There was also an unforgettable episode during that visit.
    On the carpet in the museum corridor, I inadvertently picked up a Young Pioneer badge. When I reached the sixteenth exhibition room, I happened to come across a group of Young Pioneers holding an induction ceremony there. They were taking an oath in front of a statue of Lenin. I thought to myself that the badge I picked up might have been dropped by one of the members, so I waited until their induction ceremony was over and gave the badge to a young girl who I estimated to be a counselor. The counselor gave the badge to me as a souvenir. I gladly accepted it and hung a golden commemorative badge with a portrait of Comrade Mao Zedong on her chest. As I turned around and walked only twenty steps, a group of elementary school students caught up with me, everyone smiling and surrounding me. It was the same counselor again, pinning a Communist Youth League badge on my lapel. At the same time, she said affectionately: "Hello, comrade!"
    A year has passed, and recalling that kind and enthusiastic scene is like it just happened yesterday. Let me receive the education given to me by Lenin's life and career, and with the Communist Youth League badge as proof, let me be a truly youthful Communist Youth League member.

    记列宁博物馆
    吴伯箫
    早晨，从旅馆出来，我一个人走在莫斯科的街上。我没有一个认识的人，但是我并不感到孤单、生疏。从电影生动的画面，从文学作品细致的描述，特别是从几十年来燃烧一样的向往，对莫斯科，我仿佛早就熟识。那天在街上来来往往的苏联人，无论是男的、女的，或者是老的、少的，也无论是从你对面走过来的，或者是从你身边擦过去的，都像是老朋友、老邻居，他们用亲切的眼光，和悦的脸色，来欢迎你，招呼你。都仿佛在说：“早哇！”“您好！苏维埃的客人。”我俄文懂得不多，自然说不好苏联话，但是我真挚的感情怂恿我，却一个一个作了无声的回答：“同志，您好！”并且进一步想告诉他们（尽管他们不一定问你）：“我要到列宁博物馆去”。
    那天空气很潮润，不冷，虽然在北纬快六十度的地方的10月，但是绝不像冬天。从行人走路时的轻捷和自己心情的畅快看，倒觉得有点儿像初春。听着克里姆林宫叮当……叮当……的钟声，心胸立刻像海洋一样开扩起来了，饱孕了热情，充满了力量。那钟声是浑圆的，响亮的，肃穆的，和乐的，像一种和平和繁荣的信号，又像一种叫人奋发前进的召唤。在这样的钟声里我走进了列宁博物馆。
    走进列宁博物馆像走进一个国际家庭。那里又肃静又热闹。从人们不同的皮肤的颜色，从人们说的不同的语言，知道大家是来自许多不同的国家的。很多人交换思想感情不单靠说话，微微地笑一笑或者轻轻地点点头，就仿佛彼此已经互相了解了。“列宁”这个字，不就是最响亮的国际语言吗？它的丰富的涵义，已经不只是一个举世景仰的伟大的导师的名字，已经是“朋友”“同志”“阶级友爱和团结”“世界和平和幸福”的化身了。
    带着虔敬的心情我随着络绎不绝的人群走过十六个陈列室。陈列室里不是张挂着一幅一幅关于列宁革命活动的照片、油画，就是陈列着一件一件属于列宁的纪念品和遗物。从列宁的幼年直到世界劳动人民向他最后告别，人们像跟着列宁度过了战斗的一生。是那么伟大又那么平凡的一生啊。
    列宁获得金质奖章从中学毕业以后，进了喀山大学。在那里他参加了沙皇暗探所说的“极危险”的学生小组。他以满怀的革命热情，组织学生的革命活动。因为他十四五岁的时候就读了车尔尼雪夫斯基的长篇小说“做什么？”也读了赫尔岑、涅克拉索夫那些民主诗人的作品，所以在学生中间列宁是以博学多闻著名的。一幅油画画着，十七岁的列宁带领青年学生进行反对“1884年大学章程”的斗争情况：他昂着头，眼睛望着远远的前面，步子迈得很大，一群青年学生就紧紧地跟在他后面，奋勇前进……那还不是武装斗争，但是已经给人一种坚毅果敢战斗的气氛。据记载，当列宁被逮捕的时候，押解他的警察所长对他说：“你这个年轻人，为什么要造反呢？横在你前面的是一座墙壁啊！”列宁的回答是这样：“是一座腐朽的墙壁哩，只须推撞一下，就会倒塌的。”
    在沙皇追捕、通缉，随时都有性命危险的情况底下，列宁从国内逃到国外，又从国外逃回国内，任何艰难困苦都挡不住他。他走到哪里，哪里便建立起革命的组织，传播下革命的种子。在监狱里，他避开狱卒的监视，从事革命的著作。像“论罢工”就是在监狱里写的。为了严守秘密，列宁把自己的书信和书稿用牛奶写在什么书籍的字行夹缝中间。
    1897年2月，列宁被流放到辽远的西伯利亚，住在叶尼塞省米奴新斯克州舒申斯克村。那是一座荒原上的村子，没有树林，只有几条堆满粪垢的污秽的街道。但是在那里被流放的三年，列宁竟然写了三十多种著作，著名的“俄国资本主义底发展”是其中的一部。紧张工作的空隙里，列宁还打猎，下棋，滑冰，作长途旅行，阅读他所爱好的作家：普希金、莱蒙托夫的作品。列宁是最会工作，最会休息，又最富于生活乐趣的人。
    在外国，列宁也进行着始终不懈的革命活动。在德国慕尼黑出版的“火星报”（1900年12月11日第一期出版），“曙光杂志”就是他手创的全俄性的报刊。在第四陈列室里陈列着1903—1904年列宁侨居日内瓦的时候住房的摆设。还有办“火星报”的时候所用的桌子。在第五陈列室里有1903—1906年地下印刷厂的模型。从地上的掩护用房，地下的回环曲折的通道，人们完全可以想见当年秘密革命工作的艰险和辛苦。
    再往前走，拉兹里夫光辉的一幕揭开了：那富有历史意义的草棚，那白桦树林，那湖边的小船，那岸上两个伟大心灵的亲密的会见，都留给人以永远不会磨灭的印象。列宁那时（1917年7月到8月）是在丛林深处工作的。丛林的中央，辟出一块空地，立下两个树墩，一个高一些的当桌子，另一个矮一些的做凳子。周围用树枝圈了起来，列宁就叫它作“绿色的办公室”。是在这样的办公室里，列宁写下了他的天才著作“国家与革命”。为了工作方便，列宁曾剃去胡须，穿起芬兰式的农民衣服，坐小船到拉兹里夫割草，或者跟亲密的战友斯维尔德洛夫、捷尔任斯基在草棚里秘密集会。有一个叫科里亚的十三岁的孩子，每天搜集松枝，燃起篝火替列宁烧茶，同时看望四周，遇到生人到来的时候，便吹口哨，学夜莺叫。这些都应当是社会主义革命史册上不朽的篇页。
    扮作司炉乘火车头去芬兰，两个月后的11月7日在彼得堡苏维埃非常会议上演说，高喊：“全世界社会主义革命万岁！”同一天晚上十点四十五分在斯莫尔雷宫宣布“全部国家政权归苏维埃”，……那些充满了雷鸣般的鼓掌声和巨潮般的欢呼声的场面，是人人熟悉的，人人记得的。我们经常有的“乌拉”“万岁”的欢呼，我们无妨想像是那些轰轰烈烈的场面的继续。在肃静的博物馆里，当你参观着大幅群众场面的油画的时候，那欢呼不也仿佛还能从并不遥远的地方清晰地听到吗？我们也无妨想像自己就是那些群众集会的成员吧。
    分散放在三个陈列室里有三套列宁的衣服：1918年的一套呢大衣，黑绒的领子，两排纽扣；一套带黑羊皮领子的大衣，配了一双毡筒的靴子；又一套是哗哒呢的黄灰色的列宁装和一双皮质粗劣的高腰黑皮鞋。这些都是极平常的衣裳，但是都是列宁穿过的。尊敬穿衣服的人，衣服看来也发着光辉。还有常在列宁寝室里摆着的那张小书桌，列宁跟农民代表谈话的时候坐过的那张带着宽宽大大的布套的沙发椅，跟高尔基一块谈话时候的照像……原物都静静地默默地陈列在那里，但是每一种纪念物却都仿佛在现身说法，争着告诉客人它们各自跟列宁在一起的时候那些引人入胜的故事。
    参观的结尾是放映有关列宁的纪录影片。通过影片人们直接会见了列宁。列宁走路的姿式，列宁说话的声音，列宁对人和蔼又无比坚定的态度，那是无可代替的，永远活在人们的心里的。
    那次参观，也还有一个难忘的插曲。
    在博物馆走廊的地毯上我无意中拾到一枚少年先锋队的徽章。参观走到第十六陈列室的时候，正碰上一队少年先锋队员在那里举行入队式。她们在列宁像前宣誓。我心里想，拾的那枚徽章可能就是哪个队员丢掉的吧，便等她们的入队式举行完毕的时候，把徽章去交给估计是辅导员的一个年轻的姑娘。那辅导员却把徽章送给了我，作为纪念，我高兴地接受了，同时把一枚有毛泽东同志像的金黄的纪念章给她挂在了胸上。我回头刚走了二十几步，一伙小学生又赶上我来，大家笑着，围着我。又是那个辅导员，拿一枚共青团的徽章别在了我的衣襟上。同时亲热地说：“同志，您好！”
    时间已经过去了一年了，回忆那亲切、热情的一幕，就像刚发生在昨天。接受列宁的生平和事业给自己的教育，凭共青团的徽章作证，让我名副其实地做一个不老的共青团员吧。
