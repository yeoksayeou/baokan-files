	Accumulating Fertilizer
	The "Fertilizer Accumulation Day" of the Huopen Cooperative
	The "Fertilizer Accumulation Day" activity carried out by the Huopen Agricultural Cooperative in Jianyang County, Sichuan Province since the spring of this year has played a significant role in increasing grain and cotton production.
	The Huopen Agricultural Cooperative stipulates that the 14th and 30th days of each lunar month are "Fertilizer Accumulation Days." On these days, all members of the cooperative, men, women, old, and young, begin their fertilizer accumulation activities from dawn. The cooperative stipulates that each person should accumulate 500 to 1,000 jin of residue fertilizer and mud fertilizer, or 40 to 80 jin of green manure on this day, depending on their individual circumstances. The vast majority of members always exceed the task. In addition, the cooperative also assigns a certain amount of fertilizer accumulation tasks to each member on a monthly basis, according to the fertilizer needs of each season. More than 100 primary school students in the cooperative also accumulate seven jin of green manure every day after school.
	The "Fertilizer Accumulation Day" activity has become a system that members consciously abide by and has never been interrupted. The cooperative also gives rewards to units and individuals who overfulfill the fertilizer accumulation task.
	This year, the cooperative's expenditure on purchasing commercial fertilizer was reduced by 20% compared with last year, but the amount of fertilizer applied to cultivated land increased by 47% compared with last year. Due to the increase in fertilizer, the average grain yield per mu in the whole cooperative reached more than 1,000 jin. The cotton yield per mu was 62 jin, an increase of 94% compared with last year.
	80,000 Farmers in Jinxian County, Jiangxi Province, are Busily Accumulating Fertilizer on Mountains and Fields
	In Jinxian County, Jiangxi Province, 80,000 farmers are now busily accumulating fertilizer day and night by shoveling turf and composting manure pits, going up mountains and down to the fields.
	In the 1958 production plan formulated by the Party and government leading organs of Jinxian County, the requirement for fertilizer accumulation is to accumulate 70 to 80 dan of fertilizer for each mu of double-cropping rice field for next year, and 50 dan for single-cropping rice fields. The county needs to accumulate a total of 51.8 million dan of fertilizer. In accordance with this requirement, the county will sow 400,000 mu of green manure and compost 280,000 manure pits this year. After this production increase plan was put forward, agricultural cooperative members responded enthusiastically. In the past half month, in order to strive to shovel more turf before the grass withers and yellows, they have been working hard day and night. The farmers in Qianfang District, under the personal leadership of Xing Haichuan, the secretary of the county party committee, spent eight nights building more than 34,000 manure pits and shoveling more than 600,000 dan of turf beside the fields. More than 70 members of the Communist Youth League and young people from Shangfu Agricultural Cooperative in Zhanggang Township built 43 manure pits and shoveled more than 1,000 dan of turf in one day and night. At present, the county has shoveled more than 10 million dan of turf, and 5 million dan have been composted into manure pits. The 410,000 mu of green manure crops that have been sown are growing well. In addition, farmers in the county have recently built more than 10,000 new pigsties to accumulate pig manure.
	Farmers in Ulanqab League, Inner Mongolia, etc., Accumulate 15 Billion Jin of Fertilizer
	Up to now, farmers of all ethnic groups in Ulanqab League, Jerim League, and Hetao Administrative Region in Inner Mongolia have accumulated 30 million carts (about 15 billion jin) of manure and soil fertilizer, enough to fertilize 30% to 60% of the sowing area next year. Herdsmen in pastoral areas of Chahar League, Ikezhao League, and Bayannur League also use a large amount of sheep manure to support farmers as fertilizer.
	Qinghai Farmers Have Accumulated 70% of the Fertilizer Needed for Next Year
	Farmers of all ethnic groups on the Qinghai Plateau are doing everything possible to expand fertilizer sources, and the fertilizer they have accumulated accounts for 70% of the fertilizer needed for next year. According to the requirements of next year's grain production increase plan, the farmland here will be fertilized 20% more than this year, and the phenomenon of not applying fertilizer in some high-altitude and cold mountainous areas in the past will be eliminated.
	This year's winter fertilizer accumulation upsurge came earlier than in previous years, and more was accumulated than in the same period in previous years. Composting green manure, using waste smoke from cooking to smoke soil blocks, storing human urine, and large-scale scraping of old soil on the road surface are all newly promoted fertilizer accumulation methods. The Salar and Tu farmers, who had no knowledge and habit of composting green manure, have learned to compost green manure this year. Many agricultural cooperative members have transformed their traditional chimney stoves into oxtail stoves. Some cooperatives have put forward the slogan "Every household has a urine jar, and every team builds a urine pool." (Xinhua News Agency)

    积肥
    火盆社的“积肥日”
    四川简阳县火盆农业社从今年春天开始的“积肥日”活动，对粮棉增产起了很大作用。
    火盆农业社规定夏历每月14日和30日两天为“积肥日”。到了这两天，全社男女老少从清晨起就开始积肥活动。社里规定，每人按不同情况在这天要积五百斤至一千斤渣滓肥、泥肥，或四十斤至八十斤青肥。绝大多数社员总是超额完成任务。除此以外，社里还根据各季节用肥需要，按月分配每个社员一定数量的积肥任务。全社一百多个小学生每天课余也都要积七斤青肥。
    “积肥日”活动已成为社员自觉遵守的制度，从未间断。社里对超额完成积肥任务的单位和个人也都给予奖励。
    今年全社购买商品肥料的费用比去年减少20％，但是耕地施肥量却比去年增加47％。由于肥料增加，全社平均每亩产粮达到一千斤以上。棉花亩产六十二斤，比去年增加94％。
    江西进贤县八万农民  上山下田紧张积肥
    江西省进贤县现在有八万农民日夜铲草皮、沤粪窖，上山下田紧张进行积肥。
    进贤县党政领导机关制定的1958年生产计划中，在积肥方面要求今冬为明年的每亩双季稻田积肥七十至八十担，单季稻田五十担，全县共需积肥五千一百八十万担。按照这个要求，今年全县要播种绿肥四十万亩，沤肥二十八万个粪窖。这一增产计划提出后，农业社社员们热烈响应。半个月来，他们为了争取在青草没有枯黄前多铲草皮，不分日夜，紧张劳动。前坊区的农民在县委书记邢海川亲自带领下，用八个夜晚在田边修了三万四千多个粪窖，铲草皮六十多万担。章冈乡上付农业社七十多名共青团员和青年在一昼夜内修了四十三个粪窖，铲草皮一千多担。目前，全县已铲了一千多万担草皮，有五百万担已沤进粪窖。已经播种的四十一万亩绿肥作物，生长良好。此外，全县农民最近还新修了一万多个猪圈，积蓄猪粪。
    内蒙古乌兰察布盟等
    农民积肥一百五十亿斤
    到目前为止，内蒙古乌兰察布盟、哲里木盟和河套行政区等地各族农民已经积了三千万车（约一百五十亿斤）粪肥和土肥，够施明年播种面积的30％到60％。察哈尔盟、伊克昭盟和巴彦淖尔盟畜牧区牧民，还用大量羊粪支援农民作肥料。
    青海农民已积明年
    所需肥料的70％
    青海高原上各族农民千方百计，扩大肥源，已经积得的肥料，占明年需用肥料的70％。根据明年粮食增产计划要求，这里的农田要比今年多施肥料20％，消灭过去部分高寒山地不施肥料的现象。
    今年冬季积肥高潮比往年来得早，也比往年同时期积得多。沤绿肥、利用做饭的废烟熏土块、储积人尿、大规模刮取路面陈土等都是新推广的积肥办法。没有沤绿肥知识和习惯的撒拉族和土族农民，今年都学会了沤绿肥。许多农业社社员把世代相传的烟筒灶改装成牛尾灶。有的社提出了“户户有尿罐，队队修尿池”的口号。（新华社）
