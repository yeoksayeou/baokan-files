Xinhua News Agency, November 13th: This reporter learned from the National Cotton Production Work Conference that this year's national cotton production has exceeded the target of the First Five-Year Plan, setting a new annual production record for cotton in China.

According to preliminary statistics from the conference, this year's total national cotton production is approximately 32.8 million dan, exceeding the First Five-Year Plan's target of 32.7 million dan for this year by about 100,000 dan. This is an increase of about 3.9 million dan compared to last year, and an increase of more than 2.4 million dan compared to 1955, the year with the highest production in history. According to survey estimates, the national average yield of ginned cotton per mu is 38 jin, 3.5 jin higher than the Five-Year Plan target and exceeding any year in history. Therefore, although the state adjusted the grain and cotton planting plan this year, and the national cotton planting area was more than 7 million mu less than in 1956, and more than 8 million mu less than the original target of the Five-Year Plan, the total national cotton production still exceeded the Five-Year Plan target and surpassed any previous year.

In the eight years since liberation, the rate of increase in cotton production nationwide, whether in terms of total output or yield per unit area, has greatly exceeded that before liberation. In 1949, China's cotton production was only over 8.88 million dan, but by 1951 it had exceeded the highest annual output before liberation (over 16.97 million dan), reaching over 20.61 million dan. By this year, the national annual cotton production has increased by more than two and a half times compared to 1949, and by nearly one time compared to 1936, the year with the highest cotton production before liberation. In the eight years since liberation, the average annual increase has been more than 2.9 million dan. During the period from 1930 to 1937, when cotton production was relatively high before liberation, the national annual cotton production only increased by more than 2.8 million dan, with an average annual increase of less than 410,000 dan, a difference of more than six times. The national average yield of cotton per mu was 21.6 jin in 1949, increasing to 35.1 jin in 1955, an increase of 13.5 jin in six years; while before liberation, it was 29.6 jin in 1930 and 31.6 jin in 1936, an increase of only 2 jin in six years, a difference of more than five and a half times.

Due to the rapid growth of cotton production, China's current per capita consumption level of cotton cloth has increased by about one time compared to before liberation. China's textile industry has freed itself from the miserable situation of relying on imported cotton to maintain production before liberation, and has been able to achieve development equivalent to several decades of the old China's textile industry in just eight years, increasing the production of cotton yarn and cotton cloth by more than one and a half times and three and a half times respectively.

The quality of cotton has also improved significantly in recent years. This year, the proportion of cotton with a fiber length of more than one inch has increased from less than 7% in 1950 to more than 85% this year, mainly as a result of the widespread promotion of improved cotton varieties. Currently, the area planted with improved cotton varieties accounts for more than 90% of the national cotton fields. The more than 20 million mu of low-quality coarse-lint cotton that could not be replaced by fine-lint cotton in the old China for decades has been gradually replaced over the past few years since liberation, and is now almost extinct. Due to the improvement in quality, China's cotton could only be used to weave ordinary cloth and twill before liberation, but now it can weave higher quality poplin and gabardine.

The rapid development of cotton production in China is the result of the consistent attention and strong support given to cotton production by the Chinese Communist Party and the government. The Party's policy of "giving priority to the development of grain production, while simultaneously developing cotton and various economic crops" is the fundamental guarantee for the continuous increase in cotton production. The Party and the government have also played a significant role in determining reasonable grain and cotton price ratios, implementing cotton pre-purchase and unified purchase and sales, helping cotton farmers disseminate advanced yield-increasing experiences, promote improved varieties, fight drought and eliminate waterlogging, supply pest control machinery and medicines, chemical fertilizers, and new-style improved agricultural tools, and provide loans to farmers.

Currently, the area of cotton fields in China has more than doubled compared to the more than 41 million mu in 1949. Since liberation, in addition to expanding many cotton fields in the old cotton-producing areas of the Yellow River and Yangtze River basins, China has also developed more than 1 million mu of cotton fields in the new cotton-producing areas of Xinjiang and Gansu, where the yield per unit area is relatively high. The expansion of cotton field area is one of the important reasons for the rapid increase in the total national cotton production.

The realization of national agricultural cooperativization has further created more favorable conditions for increasing cotton production. Many cotton yield-increasing measures that could not be promoted at all or could not be thoroughly implemented before cooperativization in many regions have been smoothly and widely implemented after cooperativization. After cooperativization, the production enthusiasm of farmers in various regions has greatly increased. They not only stubbornly fight against pests, droughts, and floods, but also promote improved varieties, increase fertilizer application, use new-style improved agricultural tools, and implement advanced yield-increasing technologies and experiences such as early sowing, rapid sowing, close planting, fine and detailed pruning, autumn plowing to preserve moisture, early cultivation, and deep cultivation in accordance with local conditions, thereby increasing cotton production. After cooperativization, cotton production in many regions has achieved rapid progress, and many cotton-producing areas that have always been low-yielding have also become high-yielding cotton-producing areas. Counties, townships, and cooperatives with large-scale high-yield cotton production have sprung up like mushrooms after rain in various regions across the country. Many places have reached the targets of 40 jin, 60 jin, 80 jin, and 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu as stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) ten years ahead of schedule.

Party and government leaders in various regions rely on the masses to find yield-increasing measures suitable for their local conditions, and then adopt methods such as cadres planting experimental fields to conduct typical demonstrations to lead the masses to conscientiously implement them, which has played a great role in promoting the increase of cotton yield per unit area in various regions. After the Party and government leaders of Macheng County, Hubei Province, found the key to increasing cotton production in their county, they universally planted experimental fields from the Secretary of the CPC County Committee to the production team leaders of agricultural cooperatives, so that several decisive yield-increasing measures were universally implemented; the average yield of cotton per mu in the county jumped from 60 jin last year to 103 jin this year.

    今年棉花产量创新纪录
    超额十万担突破第一个五年计划指标
    新华社13日讯　新华社记者从全国棉产工作会议获悉：今年全国的棉花总产量突破了第一个五年计划的指标，创造了我国棉花生产的最高年产量纪录。
    据这个会议的初步统计，今年全国棉花总产量约达三千二百八十万担左右，超额十万担左右完成了第一个五年计划要求今年产棉三千二百七十万担的指标，比去年增产三百九十万担左右，比历史上产量最高的1955年增产二百四十多万担。根据调查估算，全国平均每亩棉花产皮棉三十八斤，比五年计划指标高三斤半，超过了历史上任何一年；因此，虽然今年国家调整了粮棉播种计划，全国棉花播种面积比1956年少了七百多万亩，比五年计划的原定指标少了八百多万亩，但是全国的棉花总产量还是突破了五年计划指标、超过了以往任何一年。
    解放八年来，全国棉花的增产速度，无论是总产量或是单位面积产量，都大大超过解放以前。1949年我国棉花产量只有八百八十八万多担，到1951年就超过了解放前的最高年产量（一千六百九十七万多担），达到了二千零六十一万多担。到今年为止，全国棉花年产量比1949年增长了两倍半以上，比解放前棉花产量最高的1936年增长了将近一倍。解放以来的八年中，每年平均增产二百九十万多担。解放前棉花产量较高的1930—1937年间，全国棉花年产量只增长二百八十多万担，平均每年增长不到四十一万担，相差六倍多。全国平均每亩棉花的产量，1949年是二十一点六斤，1955年增长到三十五点一斤，六年间增长了十三点五斤；而解放前1930年是二十九点六斤，1936年是三十一点六斤，六年间才增长了二斤，相差五倍半以上。
    由于棉花产量增长迅速，我国当前按人口平均的棉布消费水平已经比解放前增长一倍左右，我国的纺织工业才摆脱解放前那种依赖进口棉维持生产的惨况，并且有可能在短短的八年期间获得了相当于旧中国纺织工业几十年的发展，使棉纱和棉布的产量分别提高了一倍半以上和三倍半以上。
    棉花的质量几年来也有了显著的提高，今年全国纤维长度超过一英寸的棉花，已由1950年的不足7％增加到今年的85％以上，这主要是普遍推广优良棉种的结果。现在全国棉花良种面积已占全国棉田90％以上，旧中国几十年间都不能以细绒棉代替的两千多万亩质量低劣的粗绒棉，经过解放后几年来陆续换种，目前已将近绝迹了。由于质量提高，我国的棉花在解放前只能纺织市布和斜纹，现在已能纺织品质较高的府绸和华达呢了。
    我国棉花生产的迅速发展，是由于中国共产党和政府一贯重视棉花生产并给予大力援助的结果。党提出的“优先发展粮食生产、同时发展棉花和各种经济作物”的方针是棉花不断增产的根本保证。党和政府在确定合理的粮棉比价，实行棉花预购和统购统销，帮助棉农传播先进增产经验、推广良种、抗旱除涝，供应治虫药械、化学肥料和新式改良农具，发放贷款等方面给予农民的巨大援助，也起了重大的作用。
    目前，我国的棉田面积已比1949年的四千一百多万亩增加了一倍以上。解放以来，我国除了在黄河、长江流域的老棉区扩大许多棉田外，还在新疆和甘肃的单位面积产量较高的新棉区发展了一百多万亩棉田。棉田面积扩大是全国棉花总产量迅速增长的重要原因之一。
    全国农业合作化的实现，更进一步给棉花的增产创造了更多的有利条件。许多地区合作化前根本无法推行或不能彻底推行的棉花增产措施，合作化后都顺利地得到了普遍深入的推行。合作化后，各地农民生产热情大大提高，他们不仅顽强地同虫害、旱灾、涝灾进行斗争，而且还因地制宜地推广良种、增施肥料、使用新式改良农具、实行早播、快播、密植、精细整枝、秋耕保墒、早中耕、深中耕等先进增产技术经验，因而提高了棉花的产量。在合作化后，许多地区的棉花都获得了突飞猛进的增产，不少一向低产的棉区也一跃而成为高产棉区，棉花大面积高额丰产的县、乡、合作社，更像雨后春笋一样纷纷在全国各种不同的地区出现，许多地方已经提前十年分别达到了全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）规定的平均每亩产皮棉四十斤、六十斤、八十斤和一百斤的指标。
    各地党政领导依靠群众找出适宜本地情况的增产措施，然后采取干部种试验田进行典型示范等办法领导群众认真贯彻执行，对各地提高棉花单位面积产量起了很大的推动作用。湖北省麻城县的党政领导找出本县的棉花增产关键后，上自中共县委书记下至农业社的生产队长普遍种了试验田，使几个决定性的增产措施得到了普遍贯彻；全县的棉花每亩平均产量，就由去年的六十斤跃进到今年的一百零三斤。
