    The Glorious Forty Years
    Leningrad, a city of historical renown,
    From here echoed the guns of the October Revolution,
    It heralded the dawn of a new era,
    It awakened the working people of the entire world.
    Arise, overthrow the tyrannical oppressors of exploitation and enslavement!
    Arise, let us seize control of our own destiny!
    Though the guns have fallen silent, their reverberations are eternal,
    They have transformed into a truth: Learn from the Russians.
    Forty years ago today, the workers and peasants of Russia, under the leadership of the Bolshevik Party, overthrew the rule of the old Russian feudal landlords and bourgeoisie and established their own regime. It was like a beacon in the long night, opening up a new path for the liberation of all mankind. The picture shows the workers and soldiers of Petrograd storming the Winter Palace, where the bourgeois government was entrenched, on the night of November 6, 1917.
    The Winter Palace has been taken, and Lenin, the great teacher of mankind, declared: Power belongs to the Soviets, land belongs to the peasants, and peace belongs to all nationalities!
    The newborn Soviet Republic was a thorn in the side of imperialism. Imperialism colluded with domestic reactionaries such as landlords and capitalists in the Soviet Union in an attempt to strangle the Soviet Union "in its cradle." However, the liberated people, under the leadership of the Communist Party, are a great force that is invincible and indomitable, repelling the frantic attacks of enemies at home and abroad. The picture shows the first contingent of workers' Red Guards opposing foreign armed intervention.
    After repelling the frantic attacks of enemies at home and abroad, the Soviet Union built the world's first socialist country amidst the encirclement of capitalist countries and on the basis of a backward agricultural country. In January 1931, the first Soviet blast furnace was built in the wilderness under Mount Magnitnaya, which was also the largest blast furnace in Europe at that time.
    With strong will and rapid speed, the Soviet people healed the serious wounds of war and began a great march towards communism. On July 27, 1952, the Volga-Don Canal was completed and opened to navigation.
    In 1954, the Soviet Union began an unprecedented large-scale land reclamation campaign. The picture shows spring plowing on the wasteland of Kazakhstan.
    On October 4 this year, the Soviet Union launched the first artificial Earth satellite. On November 3, it launched the second artificial Earth satellite. This astonishing and great achievement in science and technology has ushered in a new era in human science and is a new beginning for mankind to conquer outer space. The picture shows the first artificial Earth satellite placed on a frame.
    From the beginning of its founding, the Soviet Union has steadfastly pursued a peaceful foreign policy. For forty years, the Soviet Union has made unremitting struggles and efforts for the cause of peace and the friendship of all peoples. Today, the hearts of all peace-loving people around the world are turned towards Moscow. The picture shows Soviet youth representatives and youth representatives from other countries on Red Square during the 6th World Youth Festival.
    The first tractor arrives at Larino Village, Smolensk Oblast.
    On June 22, 1941, Hitler's Germany launched a perfidious attack on the Soviet Union. The Great Patriotic War began. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union led the people and army of the whole country to work together to drive the fascist German invaders out of the sacred homeland and directly attacked the lair of the German invaders - Berlin. The picture shows the Soviet army capturing the Reichstag in Berlin.

    光辉的四十年
    列宁格勒，历史的名城，
    从这里响起了十月的炮声，
    它宣告了新时代的来临，
    它唤醒了全世界的劳动人民。
    起来，推翻剥削和奴役的暴君！
    起来，让我们自己掌握自己的命运！
    炮声虽停，?响却是永恒，
    它变成了真理：学俄罗斯人。
    四十年前的今天，俄罗斯的工人农民在布尔什维克党领导下，推翻了旧俄封建地主和资产阶级的统治，建立了自己的政权。它像漫漫长夜中出现了一盏明灯，为全世界人类的解放开辟了一条新道路。图为1917年11月6日的夜晚，彼得格勒的工人和士兵向资产阶级政府盘踞的冬宫冲击的情形。
    冬宫拿下来了，人类伟大的导师列宁宣布：政权归于苏维埃，土地归于农民，和平归于各族人民！
    新生的苏维埃共和国是帝国主义的眼中钉。帝国主义勾结了苏联国内的地主、资本家等反动派企图把苏联扼杀“在摇篮中”。但是，解放了的人民在共产党的领导下，是一支所向披靡无坚不摧的伟大力量，打退了国内外敌人的疯狂进攻。图为反对外国武装干涉的第一批工人赤卫队。
    苏联打退了国内外敌人的疯狂进攻后，在资本主义国家的包围中和落后的农业国的基础上建成了世界上第一个社会主义国家。1931年1月，在马格尼托山下的荒野建成了苏联第一座高炉，它也是当时欧洲最大的高炉。
    苏联人民用坚强的意志和飞快的速度，治愈了战争的严重创伤，并开始向共产主义大进军。1952年7月27日，伏尔加—顿河运河建成通航。
    1954年苏联开始了史无前例的大规模的垦荒运动。图为哈萨克斯坦荒地上的春耕。
    今年10月4日，苏联发射了第一颗人造地球卫星。11月3日又发射了第二颗人造地球卫星。这个科学技术的惊人的伟大成就，开创了人类科学的新纪元，是人类征服宇宙空间的新开端。图为放置在架子上的第一颗人造地球卫星。
    苏联从建国开始便坚定不移地执行和平外交政策，四十年来苏联为了和平事业和各国人民的友谊作了始终不渝的斗争和努力。今天，全世界爱好和平的人们的心都向着莫斯科。图为第六届世界青年联欢节中，苏联青年代表和其他国家的青年代表在红场上。
    第一架拖拉机到达斯摩林斯克州拉里诺村。
    1941年6月22日希特勒德国背信弃义向苏联发动进攻。伟大的卫国战争开始了，苏联共产党领导着全国军民，同心同德把法西斯德寇赶出神圣的国土，直捣德寇的巢穴——柏林。图为苏军在柏林攻占了国会大厦。
