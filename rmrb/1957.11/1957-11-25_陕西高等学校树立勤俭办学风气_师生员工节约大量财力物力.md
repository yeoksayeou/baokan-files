Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 24th - Nine higher education institutions in Shaanxi Province have begun to establish a frugal school management style, reversing the phenomenon of extravagance and waste. They have recently formulated annual or semester-long savings plans, preparing to save more than 2 million yuan in expenses. Currently, teachers, students, and staff in these schools, under the principle of ensuring the smooth completion of teaching tasks, have used various methods such as adjusting the use of existing equipment or using old and waste materials to reconstruct new tools, saving a large amount of financial and material resources. Some schools have already overfulfilled or completed their original savings plans ahead of schedule. Xi'an Medical College changed the students' experimental time from being concentrated in the morning to alternating between morning and afternoon, which reduced the need to purchase sixty microscopes and also saved ten laboratories. Xi'an Institute of Architectural Engineering replaced a 100-ton universal testing machine with a 50-ton machine, saving 60,000 yuan.

Teachers, students, and staff in some schools also saved a lot of expenses by repairing, cleaning, or manufacturing instruments themselves. Teachers from the surveying and teaching research group at Xi'an Institute of Architectural Engineering cleaned and repaired more than 100 damaged and old surveying instruments, levels, and other instruments, ensuring the smooth progress of teaching work and saving 3,000 yuan in repair costs.

In terms of capital construction, all schools have lowered design standards, and houses that can be not built or postponed will not be built. Xi'an Institute of Architectural Engineering reduced the design standards for family dormitories and instrument repair shops, saving 15,000 yuan. Xi'an Normal College originally planned to spend 100,000 yuan to build a covered sports ground. Later, they converted the construction shed into a simple covered sports ground, saving all of the originally planned expenses.

    陕西高等学校树立勤俭办学风气
    师生员工节约大量财力物力
    新华社西安24日电　陕西省有九所高等院校开始树立勤俭办学风气，扭转铺张浪费的现象，最近分别订出了全年或者一学期的节约方案，准备节约经费二百多万元。目前，这些学校的师生和员工已经在保证教学任务顺利完成的原则下，用调整使用现有仪器设备或利用旧料、废料改制新器具等各种办法，节约了大量的财力和物力。有些学校已经超额或者提前完成原订的节约计划。西安医学院把学生实验时间由原来集中在上午改为上、下午轮流进行，便可少购买六十架显微镜，同时还可节省十个实验室。西安建筑工程学院用五十吨的万能材料实验机代替一百吨的同样机器，就可节省六万元。
    有些学校师生员工自己修理、擦洗或制造仪器，也节约了很多用费。西安建筑工程学院测量教研组的教师们擦洗和修理了过去损坏和年久破旧的经纬仪、水准仪等一百多件仪器，保证了教学工作顺利进行，还少花三千元的修理费。
    在基本建设方面，各校都降低设计标准，可以不建或缓建的房屋都不建。西安建筑工程学院降低眷属宿舍和仪器修配室等房屋的设计标准，可节约一万五千元。西安师范学院原来准备花费十万元修建一幢风雨操场，后来，他们把工棚改为简易的风雨操场，就把原来计划的费用全部节省下来。
