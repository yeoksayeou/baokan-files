Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu Electric Dispatch: The late rice crop on over eight million mu of double-cropping rice fields in Sichuan Province has been basically harvested. According to estimates from relevant departments, the average yield of late rice per mu increased by more than 10% compared to last year, resulting in a total increase of over 800 million jin of rice, accounting for approximately one-third of the province's total grain production increase this year.

The double-cropping rice in Sichuan Province has been widely promoted in recent years with the development of agricultural cooperativization. This year, the double-cropping rice area in the province expanded from over four million mu last year to over eight million nine hundred thousand mu. During the growth period of the late rice, the province faced continuous autumn drought and consecutive days of overcast and rainy weather, and the damage from rice borers was more severe than last year. However, all localities widely publicized and implemented double-cropping rice yield-increasing technologies, and relevant departments provided significantly more seeds, pesticides, machinery, and commercial fertilizers for double-cropping rice production than last year. Party and government leading organs at all levels dispatched a large number of cadres to go deep into the rural areas to provide specific leadership. Therefore, agricultural cooperatives in all localities took measures such as early planting and timely fertilization for late rice, and fought against various natural disasters, finally achieving increased production.

    四川八百多万亩晚稻丰收
    据新华社成都电　四川省八百多万亩双季稻的晚稻基本上收割完毕。据有关部门估计，平均每亩晚稻比去年增产一成多，共可增产稻谷八亿多斤，约为今年全省粮食增产总量的三分之一。
    四川省的双季稻，是近几年随着农业合作化的发展而大量推广的。今年全省双季稻面积由去年的四百多万亩扩大到八百九十多万亩。在晚稻生长期间曾经连续遇到秋旱和连日阴雨，螟虫为害也比去年严重。但是，各地广泛宣传推行了双季稻增产技术，有关部门支援双季稻生产的种籽、药械、商品肥料也比去年大大增加。各地党政领导机关派出大批干部，深入农村具体领导。因此各地农业社对晚稻都作到提前早栽、及时施肥等措施，并对各种自然灾害进行了斗争，终于获得增产。
