Xinhua News Agency:

Following the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, rural areas in Liaoning Province, having achieved initial victory in the socialist great debate, have begun large-scale construction of farmland water conservancy, soil and water conservation, and drainage projects.

By the end of October, the Liaoyang Special District had mobilized 163,000 workers, completing 200,000 cubic meters of earthwork. In the Jinzhou Special District, water conservancy technicians from nine counties, including Xingcheng and Lingyuan, have gone to key townships and agricultural production cooperatives to provide specific guidance on construction. More than 1,000 rural water conservancy construction technical backbones trained in five counties, including Heishan and Jianping, have also returned to their communes to participate in construction. In the Andong Special District, projects to develop 200,000 mu of new paddy fields and carry out soil and water conservation on 500,000 mu have also begun successively, striving to complete 60% of the total project before the ground freezes.

Before the start of construction, all regions conducted specific planning and deployment. The Liaoyang and Andong Special Districts successively held county party secretary and county head conferences around October 23, while Suizhong and other nine counties in the Jinzhou Special District and Xifeng County in the Tieling Special District held conferences of key district and township cadres to arrange farmland water conservancy construction plans for this winter and next spring. The above areas plan to newly develop 573,000 mu of paddy fields, control 2,330,000 mu of soil and water conservation area, and eliminate waterlogging on 2,280,000 mu through projects such as building reservoirs, digging canals, sinking wells, and constructing gully dams. The Liaoyang Special District also plans to restore 76,000 mu of paddy fields and increase irrigation for 112,500 mu of dry land. Upon completion of these projects, the Liaoyang and Andong Special Districts alone can increase grain production by 431,000 tons in 1958.

    大辩论初获胜利
    辽宁各地大修水利
    新华社讯　中共八届三中全会精神下达后，辽宁省各地农村已在社会主义大辩论初获胜利的基础上，开始大修农田水利、水土保持和排涝工程。
    到10月底，辽阳专区已用工十六万三千个，完成土方工程二十万公方。锦州专区兴城、凌源等九县的水利技术人员，全部深入重点乡和农业生产合作社，具体指导施工。黑山、建平等五县训练的农村水利建设技术骨干一千多名，也已回社参加施工。安东专区新开水田二十万亩、进行水土保持五十万亩的工程，也已陆续开始，争取在结冻前完成总工程量的60％。
    各地开始施工之前都进行了具体规划部署。辽阳、安东两个专区先后在10月23日前后召开了县委书记、县长会议，锦州专区绥中等九个县和铁岭专区的西丰县，召开了区、乡主要干部会议，安排了今冬明春农田水利建设计划。以上地区准备通过修水库、挖渠、打井筑谷坊等工程，新开水田五十七万三千亩，水土保持控制面积二百三十三万亩，排除内涝二百二十八万亩。辽阳专区还计划恢复水田七万六千亩；增加旱田灌溉十一万二千五百亩。这些工程完成后，仅辽阳、安东两个专区，1958年就可增产粮食四十三万一千吨。
