According to newspaper reports, following the scientific work plan implemented under the International Geophysical Year program, the Soviet Union launched its second artificial earth satellite on November 3, 1957. The launch of the second artificial satellite is another outstanding achievement of Soviet science. Thanks to the intense and fruitful work of a large number of scientists, engineers, technicians, and workers, an artificial satellite with an effective weight of 508.3 kilograms, six times that of the first artificial satellite, was manufactured and launched into orbit. At the same time, the orbit of the second artificial satellite is much farther from the ground than that of the first artificial satellite.

The second artificial satellite is equipped with various scientific instruments sufficient to carry out large-scale research programs. The artificial satellite carries instruments for studying cosmic rays, instruments for studying solar radiation in the ultraviolet and X-ray spectral bands, a sealed cabin containing experimental animals (dogs), radio telemetry instruments for sending measurement materials to Earth, radio transmitters, and necessary power supply equipment.

Satellite Orbit and Its Evolution

The second artificial satellite was launched into orbit by a multi-stage rocket. During the process of launching into orbit, the rocket rises to an altitude of several hundred kilometers above the ground. In the final stage of launching, the final stage rocket flies parallel to the ground at a speed of more than eight kilometers per second, which becomes an Earth satellite. When launched into orbit, the fuel reserves in the rocket body are exhausted and the engine stops working. The continued movement of the satellite is maintained by the kinetic energy obtained by the rocket during the launch phase.

The speed imparted to the final stage rocket is greater than the speed required for the satellite to move along a circular orbit at a fixed altitude corresponding to the highest point when launched into orbit. Therefore, the satellite does not move in a circular orbit, but in an elliptical orbit, with the farthest distance from the Earth being approximately 1,700 kilometers, which is almost twice the maximum altitude reached when the first satellite was launched. Because the semi-major axis of the second satellite's orbit is larger than that of the first satellite's orbit, the period of the second satellite's rotation around the Earth is also longer, initially at 103.7 minutes.

As a result of the increased rotation period, the second satellite revolves around the Earth approximately fourteen full circles per day and night, while the first satellite revolved around the Earth approximately fifteen circles per day and night in its initial operation. Due to the Earth's rotation, the position moved by the second satellite per revolution in its daily motion is about one-fifteenth greater than that of the first satellite in terms of changes in longitude. The distance between adjacent circles seen on the ground is also increased by one-fifteenth.

The resistance of the Earth's atmosphere causes the satellite to decelerate. At the same time, the size and shape of the satellite's orbit also change. Because the atmosphere at high altitude is extremely thin, the resistance acting on the satellite is small. Therefore, the changes in orbital parameters are also very slow. Because the atmospheric density decreases rapidly with altitude, deceleration mainly occurs in the perigee region. At the apogee, the satellite is operating at a very high altitude, at which time the satellite is in outer space outside the Earth's atmosphere. According to theoretical data, the Earth's atmosphere extends to an altitude of 1,000 kilometers above the ground.

The deceleration of the satellite depends not only on the density of the atmosphere, but also on the shape of the satellite and the ratio of the satellite's weight to its cross-sectional area (i.e., the so-called cross-sectional density). The greater the cross-sectional density, the smaller the speed loss.

If two satellites are launched into the same orbit and the magnitudes of the deceleration forces they experience are different, their operation will be different after a period of time, because their orbits will change due to different speeds. And it mainly reduces the size of the orbit due to the lowering of the apogee altitude.

The first satellite and its carrier rocket initially operated in approximately the same orbit, with a small difference in their operating periods, approximately 96.2 minutes. Currently, because the resistance experienced by the first satellite is smaller than that of the carrier rocket, their orbits are very different. The highest point of the carrier rocket from the ground is 100 kilometers lower than the highest point of the satellite from the ground. According to data from November 10, the operating period of the carrier rocket is approximately 74 seconds shorter than that of the first satellite.

The resistance experienced by the carrier rocket and the satellite changes at any time due to changes in orbital parameters. As the orbit lowers, the resistance continues to increase. This situation can be clearly confirmed by observation results. When the orbit is lowered to an altitude of 100 kilometers, the resistance will increase to the point that the satellite and carrier rocket become hot, causing them to further rapidly descend and burn up.

The satellite's existence time depends on the magnitude of the resistance experienced by the satellite in the atmosphere. Obviously, the greater the operating period and the smaller the resistance, then the longer the satellite's existence time. Based on the results of calculations based on data obtained from observing the first satellite and carrier rocket, it can be inferred that the satellite's existence time should be approximately three months from the time of launch. That is to say, the first satellite will remain in orbit until the end of 1957. The carrier rocket has a shorter existence time than the first satellite. Therefore, it can be predicted that the burning of the carrier rocket will occur earlier than that of the satellite. The second satellite has a larger operating period and is less affected by resistance than the first satellite. Therefore, it can be determined that the second satellite will operate in orbit for a significantly longer time than the first satellite.

Based on the current results of studying orbital evolution, the entire process of the evolution of satellite orbital parameters can be determined, and important information about the density distribution of the upper atmosphere can be obtained. In the future, it will be possible to reliably predict the existence time of artificial earth satellites.

Observation Work of Artificial Earth Satellites

Sixty-six specialized optical observation stations, all astronomical observatories in the Soviet Union, and approximately thirty foreign astronomical observatories are conducting systematic optical observations of the operation of the first two Earth satellites and the first satellite's carrier rocket. Optical observation station networks are currently being organized in various People's Democratic countries. The number of foreign astronomical observatories conducting systematic observations of artificial satellites is increasing every day. Due to the huge brightness of the carrier rocket and the second satellite, high-altitude meteorological stations of the Hydrometeorological Bureau can also conduct visual observations as long as they have wind-measuring theodolites.

The results of observations with optical instruments show that the brightness of the carrier rocket often changes. This is related to its change in spatial direction. According to visual observations, the shortest interval for brightness change is approximately twenty seconds.

While conducting visual observations, photographic observations are also being conducted on the carrier rocket and the second satellite. Based on the photographs taken by the Pulkovo Observatory, the Astrophysical Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the Kazakh Republic, the Astronomical Observatory of Kharkov State University, and other astronomical institutions in the Soviet Union, as well as photographs taken by the Zijinshan Observatory (People's Republic of China), the Edinburgh Observatory (United Kingdom), the Dunsink Observatory (Ireland), and the Potsdam Observatory (German Democratic Republic), the orbits of the satellite and carrier rocket can be verified.

Radio observations of artificial Earth satellites provide extremely rich data. Radio observation stations located at different longitudes and latitudes, clubs of the Volunteer Association for Support of the Army, Navy and Air Force of the Soviet Union, many universities, and hundreds of thousands of radio enthusiasts have conducted such observations. The data obtained are extremely extensive, and only preliminary processing has been completed so far.

Measuring the intensity of radio signals received from satellites is of great significance. This measurement is carried out in two ways, one is continuous automatic recording, and the other is local measurement within a certain period of time. Based on the results of measuring the intensity of radio signals, the situation of the ionosphere absorbing radio waves can be estimated, including the area above the region with the maximum intensity of the main ionosphere F2 ionization, which cannot be reached by general measurement methods on the ground. Based on these measurements, the possible paths of radio wave propagation in the ionosphere can also be determined.

The results of listening to radio signals from artificial satellites and measuring the intensity of radio signals show that signals with a wavelength of fifteen meters can be received over very long distances, far exceeding visibility. These distances reach 10,000 kilometers, 12,000 kilometers, or even 15,000 kilometers, and sometimes even further.

It is particularly noteworthy that when the satellite is operating in an elliptical orbit, the relative position of the region with the highest electron concentration in the Earth's atmosphere is constantly changing. When studying radio observation materials, it is necessary to consider whether the satellite is actually located above the true altitude of the maximum electron concentration of the F2 layer at that instant, or whether it is located below it. (This electron concentration is obtained according to the high-frequency characteristics of the ionosphere taken by the ionosphere station.) When the satellite is operating in the southern hemisphere, it is higher than the ionosphere, while in the northern hemisphere, it is sometimes higher than the maximum ionosphere, sometimes lower than the maximum ionosphere, and sometimes close to the maximum ionosphere. This situation creates great differences in the path of long-distance radio shortwave propagation. One of these routes is that radio waves that are emitted through the entire ionosphere are reflected from the ground and then reflected once from the ionosphere where the critical frequency has a maximum value. In other cases, radio waves falling on the ionosphere from above at a certain angle are greatly refracted in the ionosphere and therefore enter areas outside the geometric line of sight.

The position of the satellite near the maximum ionosphere of the atmosphere can create favorable conditions for propagating radio waves using the ionospheric radio waveguide. Observations have proven that in some cases, radio waves do not reach the receiving location through the shortest distance, but bypass the Earth and reach the receiving location along the long arc of a large circle. In individual cases, the phenomenon of radio signal echoes traveling around the Earth once appeared. In some cases, the intensity of the signal is greater than the distance originally calculated according to the law that it is inversely proportional to the distance. This also shows that there are waveguides in the ionosphere.

Recording the change in the beat tone between the frequency of the radio waves emitted by the artificial satellite and the vibration frequency of the local oscillator on magnetic tape can obtain meaningful results about the Doppler effect. There are many such records, and they are currently being processed.

There is no doubt that the large amount of material obtained by radio observation of artificial Earth satellites will provide valuable material on the characteristics of ionization in the upper part of the ionosphere, as well as the absorption and propagation properties of radio waves in this part of the ionosphere after final processing.

Construction of the Second Satellite

As mentioned above, the Soviet second artificial Earth satellite differs from the first satellite in that it is the last stage of the rocket, which contains all the scientific measurement instruments. This arrangement of instruments greatly simplifies the task of determining the satellite's position by relying on optical observation instruments, because the experience of the first satellite has proven that observing the carrier rocket is much simpler than observing the satellite. The brightness of the carrier rocket exceeds the brightness of the first satellite by several magnitudes. The total weight of the various instruments, experimental animals, and power supply equipment on the second satellite is 508.3 kilograms.

The frame at the front of the last stage rocket is equipped with instruments for studying solar radiation in the short-wave ultraviolet and X-ray spectral bands, a spherical container containing radio transmitters and other instruments, and a sealed cabin containing experimental animals (dogs). Instruments for studying cosmic rays are installed on the rocket body. The instruments and containers installed on the frame are protected by a special conical protective body, so that they are not affected by the aerodynamic and thermal forces generated when the rocket flies through the dense layers of the atmosphere. When the last stage rocket flies into orbit, the conical protective body automatically falls off.

The two radio transmitters installed in the spherical container operate at frequencies of 40.002 and 20.005 MHz respectively. The radio transmitter's power supply equipment, temperature control device, and sensitive instruments for recording temperature changes and other parameters are also installed in this container. This spherical container is structurally similar to the Soviet first artificial Earth satellite.

The signal of the radio transmitter with a frequency of 20.005 MHz (wavelength of 15 meters) adopts the form of a telegraph signal. Each signal has the same duration and interval time, averaging approximately 0.3 seconds. When certain parameters (temperature, pressure) inside the spherical container change, the signal duration and interval time also change within a certain range.

The radio transmitter with a frequency of 40.002 MHz (wavelength of 7.5 meters) operates in a continuous transmission state. The installation of two radio transmitters with the above wavelengths ensures the study of the propagation of radio waves emitted from the satellite and the measurement of its orbital parameters. It also ensures that signals can be received from the satellite in any state of the ionosphere. The selection of wavelengths and the sufficient energy of the radio transmitter make it possible for vast radio enthusiasts to conduct radio observations of the satellite like specialized observation stations.

The sealed cabin containing experimental animals (dogs) is cylindrical. In order to establish the necessary conditions for the animal's normal survival, it contains food reserves, as well as an air conditioning system and a temperature control system composed of reduction equipment. In addition, the cabin is also equipped with instruments for recording pulse, breathing, and blood pressure, instruments for obtaining cardiograms, and sensitive elements for measuring the cabin's parameters (temperature, pressure).

The animal cabin and the spherical container are made of aluminum alloy. Their surfaces are smooth and have been specially processed to give their surfaces the necessary coefficient values for radiating and absorbing solar radiation energy. The temperature control system installed in the spherical container and the animal cabin enables them to maintain a certain temperature inside. Due to the forced circulation of gas, heat is sent to the outer shell.

In addition to the above equipment, the last stage rocket body is also equipped with: radio telemetry instruments, temperature measuring instruments, and equipment for supplying power to scientific instruments and measuring instruments. The surface and internal temperature of the animal cabin, as well as the temperature of various instruments and structural parts, are determined by the temperature material transmitters installed on them. The radio telemetry device ensures that all measurement materials of the satellite are broadcast to Earth. According to a special chart, the radio telemetry device is turned on at regular intervals to broadcast measurement materials.

The scientific research plan for observing the second artificial satellite is set for seven days and nights. Now, this plan has been completed. The satellite's radio transmitter and radio telemetry device have stopped working. In the future, the observation of the operation of the second artificial satellite and the study of the characteristics of the upper atmosphere and the prediction of the satellite's operation will be carried out with optical instruments and radar equipment.

Scientific Measurements on Artificial Earth Satellites

Artificial Earth satellites allow scientists for the first time to conduct various experiments in the upper atmosphere that were previously impossible.

Short-Wave Radiation of the Sun

Studying the short-wave ultraviolet radiation of the Sun is of paramount scientific and practical significance for physics, astrophysics, and geophysics. Recent studies have shown that in addition to visible light, the Sun also has radiation with a wide range of wavelengths, from X-rays with wavelengths of approximately hundreds of millions of a centimeter to radio waves with wavelengths of several meters.

Radiation at the short-wave end of the solar spectrum (i.e., far-ultraviolet and X-ray radiation) and radio radiation are related to physical phenomena (chromosphere and corona) occurring in the little-studied outer layers of the solar atmosphere and have a great impact on the Earth's atmosphere. The basic radiation of the solar chromosphere is concentrated on the hydrogen spectral line with a wavelength of 1215 angstroms (one angstrom equals one hundred millionth of a centimeter) located in the far-ultraviolet spectral band, while the corona radiation is concentrated in the soft X-ray spectral band of 3 to 100 angstroms. The corona, which is composed of very thin material, has a temperature of nearly one million degrees, and it seems that the temperature in some areas of the corona is even higher than this. To date, the nature of the corona is still largely a mystery.

The total energy of short-wave solar radiation is not large - it is tens of thousands of times weaker than the energy of visible light emitted by the Sun, but it is this radiation that has a particularly large impact on the Earth's atmosphere. This is because short-wave radiation is extremely active and can ionize air molecules to form the ionosphere, that is, the strongly ionized upper atmosphere. According to current views, the lower layer (D layer) of the ionosphere, which is 70 to 90 kilometers high, is formed by the ionization of air molecules by the hydrogen spectral line radiation emitted by the chromosphere, while the upper layer (E layer), which is 90 to 100 kilometers high, is formed by the X-ray radiation of the corona.

The conditions of the upper layers of the Sun and the ionosphere are not fixed - but are constantly changing. It has been determined that there is a close relationship between solar activity (i.e., the so-called chromospheric eruption phenomenon) and the absorption of radio waves in the ionosphere (which can interrupt radio communications). Therefore, it is speculated that changes in the intensity of short-wave solar radiation are directly related to the processes occurring in the ionosphere.

The Earth's atmosphere completely absorbs the Sun's ultraviolet radiation, only releasing the near-ultraviolet radiation part close to the purple side of the visible spectrum. This absorption effect of the Earth's atmosphere protects living organisms from the harmful short-wave solar radiation. At the same time, however, it makes it impossible to study this radiation on Earth. The absorption capacity of air molecules is so great that it is necessary to install instruments on artificial Earth satellites and completely get outside the atmosphere to observe this short-wave radiation. Although good results have been obtained using high-altitude rockets, only by using satellites is it possible to conduct systematic measurements for a long period of time necessary to study changes in the intensity of short-wave ultraviolet radiation.

Three special photomultiplier tubes with angles of 120 degrees to each other are used as receivers of radiation. Each photomultiplier tube is sequentially covered with several filters made of thin metal sheets and organic films, as well as special optical materials, so that the various wavebands in the X-ray part of the solar spectrum and the far-ultraviolet part and hydrogen spectral line can be separated. The electrical signal emitted by the photomultiplier tube facing the sun is amplified by a radio circuit and sent to Earth by means of a telemetry device.

Since the artificial satellite's orientation to the sun is constantly changing and it spends part of its time operating in an orbit facing away from the sun, in order to save power, the instrument's circuit is only turned on when the sun shines on one of the three light receivers. Turning on the circuit is achieved by means of a photoresistor and an automatic device that is also equipped with a photomultiplier tube and is illuminated by the sun.

While observing solar radiation from the satellite, the entire joint solar observation network on Earth, which is working according to the plan of the International Geophysical Year, is also observing the sun. These observations are carried out by astrophysical observatories, ionosphere research stations, and solar radiation receiving stations. After comparing all these observation results, it will be possible to draw preliminary conclusions about the relationship between the Sun's ultraviolet radiation and X-ray radiation and the processes occurring in the Sun's chromosphere and corona, as well as the relationship with the conditions of the Earth's atmosphere. These materials can be used as the basis for future systematic observations.

Research on Cosmic Rays

In cosmic space, the atomic nuclei of various elements are constantly accelerating and gaining huge amounts of energy. The cosmic rays produced as a result make it possible to study the universe very far from the Earth, even the universe very far from the solar system. Cosmic rays are affected by the medium through which they pass on their way from their place of origin to the Earth. As a result of a series of processes, the composition and intensity of this radiation are changed. For example, when the sun encounters strong bursts and creates conditions for the nuclei to accelerate to great energy, the number of cosmic ray particles increases. The additional increase in cosmic rays generated on the sun is formed as a result.

The sun is also a source of particle radiation. There are strong magnetic and electric fields in the particle radiation flow, which affect cosmic rays. Cosmic rays can be used to study particle radiation flows very far from the Earth.

When cosmic ray particles pass through the Earth's magnetic field, they are strongly deflected in the magnetic field. Only particles with very strong energy can reach any area of the Earth without hindrance. The less energy the particles have, the smaller the range of areas on Earth that these particles can reach. Low-energy particles can only reach the Arctic and Antarctic regions. In this way, the Earth seems to be surrounded by an energy barrier, which is highest in the equatorial region. The higher the geomagnetic latitude, the lower the barrier. Only protons in cosmic rays with energy greater than 14 billion electron volts can reach the equatorial region. Particles with energy greater than 7 billion electron volts can reach the southern region of the Soviet Union. Finally, particles with energy greater than 1.5 billion electron volts can reach the Moscow region. By measuring cosmic rays at different latitudes, it is possible to determine how many particles there are in cosmic rays and how much energy they carry. The relationship between the number of cosmic ray particles and latitude, the so-called latitude effect, determines the distribution of particles by energy, that is, the energy spectrum of cosmic rays.

Due to a series of processes that occur in cosmic space, the number and composition of cosmic rays are constantly changing. In some cases, for example, when particles occur on the sun, it is expected that only the number of low-energy particles will increase, and the number of very high-energy particles will not change. Conversely, changes in the Earth's magnetic field and the impact of particle flows emitted by the sun on cosmic rays will change not only the number of small-energy particles, but also the number of large-energy particles.

To clarify the essence of the changes that occur in cosmic rays, it is necessary to determine not only whether the intensity of cosmic rays increases or decreases, but also how the number of particles with various energies changes. The satellite operates at a speed of eight kilometers per second, and it can fly from one latitude zone to another latitude zone in a very short time. In this way, by measuring cosmic rays on the satellite, it is possible to determine the latitude effect of this radiation, and thus it is also possible to determine the distribution of particles of this radiation by energy. It is especially important that a large number of such measurements can be carried out at one time. Therefore, relying on satellites, it is possible not only to observe changes in the intensity of cosmic rays, but also to observe changes in its composition.

Particles in cosmic rays are recorded on the satellite using charged particle counters. When a charged particle passes through the counter, a spark occurs, generating a pulse in a radio circuit composed of semiconductor transistors. The function of this radio circuit is to calculate the number of cosmic ray particles and to send a signal after a certain number of particles have been calculated. After the radio sends a signal about the calculation of a certain number of particles, the recording work is carried out again, and after the same number of particles have been calculated, a new signal is sent. Dividing the recorded number of particles by the time it takes to calculate these particles can give the number of particles passing through the counter per second, or the intensity of cosmic rays.

The satellite is equipped with two identical instruments for recording charged particles. The axes of the counters of the two instruments are perpendicular to each other.

The results of preliminary studies of the cosmic ray data emitted by the satellite indicate that the two instruments are functioning normally. These data clearly show that the number of cosmic ray particles varies with the latitude of the Earth's magnetic field. A large number of measurements of the energy spectrum of particles in primary cosmic rays make it possible to study how this energy spectrum changes over time and to compare it with the processes that occur in the cosmic space around us during this period.

Research on Physiological Phenomena in Space Flight

In order to study a series of medical and biological problems, a special sealed cabin containing experimental animals (a dog named "Laika"), measuring devices for studying the animal's physiological functions, and devices for regenerating air, supplying animal feed, and removing the products of animal life activities were installed on the satellite. When designing this device, consideration was given to minimizing the size and weight of the instruments and reducing their power consumption to a minimum.

This device has to work for a long period of time. Through the radio telemetry system, it ensures the recording of the animal's pulse and breathing rate, as well as the magnitude of its arterial blood pressure and cardiac physiological potential, the temperature and pressure in the animal cabin, and so on.

In order to regenerate air and maintain the necessary gas composition in the animal cabin, highly effective chemical compounds are used to supply the oxygen needed for the animal's breathing and absorb carbon dioxide and excess moisture. The amount of substances involved in the chemical reaction is automatically adjusted. Since there is no air convection in a weightless environment, a forced ventilation system is installed in the animal cabin. Maintaining a certain temperature in the animal cabin is achieved by a temperature control system. In order to ensure the supply of the diet required by the animal during flight, a device for feeding the animal is installed in the container.

The dog "Laika" riding on the satellite had been trained in advance. This animal had gradually become accustomed to wearing special clothes and living in a very small sealed cabin for a long time. It had also become accustomed to the transmitters for recording physiological functions installed on various parts of its body, and so on. The dog was also trained to be accustomed to the effect of sudden increases in weight. The stability of this animal to vibration and other factors was determined on the test bench. As a result of long-term training, this animal was able to live quietly in the sealed cabin for several weeks, which ensured that the necessary scientific research could be carried out.

Due to the extensive prior experiments conducted by the Soviet Union on short-term flights of animals in rockets to altitudes of 100 to 200 kilometers over the years, it is now possible to study the physiological phenomena of living organisms in space flight.

Unlike previous studies, the animal's flight on the satellite makes it possible to study the long-term effects of weight loss. To date, the effects of weight loss can be studied for several seconds using aircraft, and for several minutes using vertical launches of rockets. Satellite flights make it possible to study the condition of the animal's body in the conditions of weight loss for several consecutive days.

The experimental data obtained from the implementation of the medical and physiological research plan are currently being studied carefully and meticulously. It can now be determined that the animal under test withstood well the long-term effects of acceleration during the satellite's launch into orbit and the subsequent weightless conditions lasting for several days. The data obtained indicate that the animal's condition was satisfactory throughout the test period.

There is no doubt that the experiments conducted will be a great contribution to the successful mastery of the upcoming interstellar flight enterprise and can lay the foundation for designing equipment to ensure the safe space flight of people.

The Soviet Union's launch of the first two artificial Earth satellites is a major contribution to the study of the upper atmosphere and has also expanded the scope of human understanding of the surrounding universe. At the same time, this also shows that our country's science and technology have a high level and foreshadows that the day when mankind can directly study the entire space around the sun is coming soon.

    苏联第二个人造地球卫星
    苏联“真理报”编辑部
    据报纸报道，按照根据国际地球物理年计划而实行的科学工作计划，苏联在1957年11月3日发射了第二个人造地球卫星。第二个人造卫星的发射是苏联科学的新的卓越的成就。由于大批科学家、工程师、技术人员和工人紧张的卓有成果的工作，有效重量为五百零八·三公斤即为第一个人造卫星的六倍的人造卫星才得以制成并发射到轨道上。同时，第二个人造卫星的轨道要比第一个人造卫星距离地面远得多。
    第二个人造卫星装备着足以实现大规模的研究计划的各种科学仪器。人造卫星上载有研究宇宙线的仪器，研究太阳在紫外线和X射线光谱段的辐射的仪器，装有试验动物（狗）的密封舱，用来向地球发送测量材料的无线电遥测仪器，无线电发报机以及必要的电源设备。
    卫星的轨道及其演变
    把第二个人造卫星发射到轨道上去是靠多级火箭来实现的。在发射到轨道上去的过程中，火箭升到离地面数百公里的高空，在发射的最后阶段，最末一级火箭就以每秒八公里多的速度和地面平行地飞行，这就变成了地球卫星。在发射到轨道上时，火箭体内的燃料储备已经耗尽，发动机也就停止了工作。卫星的继续运动靠火箭在发射阶段的运动所获得的动能来维持。
    传给最末一级火箭的速度大于卫星沿着圆形轨道在相当于发射到轨道时最高点的固定高度上运动所必需的速度。所以卫星并不是按圆形轨道，而是按椭圆形轨道运行着的，这个椭圆离开地球的最远距离约为一千七百公里，差不多超过发射第一个卫星时所达到的最高度一倍。因为第二个卫星轨道的半长轴大于第一个卫星轨道的半长轴，所以第二个卫星绕地球旋转的周期也要大，在运行的初期为一○三·七分钟。
    由于旋转周期增大的结果，第二个卫星每昼夜约绕地球十四个整圈，而第一个卫星在运行初期每昼夜约绕地球十五圈。由于地球的自转，在周日运动中，第二个卫星每转一圈移动的位置按经度的变化说，约比第一个卫星大十五分之一。在地面看到的相邻两圈之间的距离也增加了十五分之一。
    地球大气的阻力引起卫星的减速。同时卫星轨道的大小和形状也发生变化。由于高空大气极为稀薄，作用于卫星上的阻力是不大的。因此轨道参数的变化也极为缓慢。由于大气密度随高度而迅速减少，所以减速主要发生在近地点区域。在远地点，卫星运行的高度很高，此时卫星处于地球大气圈以外的宇宙空间，根据理论资料推算，地球大气一直伸展到离地面一千公里的高度。
    卫星的减速不仅取决于大气的密度，而且也取决于卫星的形状和卫星重量与断面面积之比（即所谓断面密度）。断面密度愈大，速度损失就愈小。
    如果把两个卫星发射到同一轨道上去，并使它们所受减速力的大小不同，过一段时间之后它们的运行就会各有不同，因为它们运行的轨道将因不同的速度而发生变化。而且主要是由于远地点高度的降低而缩小轨道的大小。
    第一个卫星及其运载火箭最初差不多在同一条轨道上运行，两者运行周期相差不大，约为九十六·二分。目前，由于第一个卫星受到的阻力比运载火箭小，所以它们的轨道大大不同了。运载火箭离地面的最高点比卫星离地面最高点低一百公里。据11月10日资料，运载火箭的运行周期比第一个卫星的运行周期约短七十四秒。
    运载火箭和卫星所受的阻力都因轨道参数的改变而随时变化。随着轨道的降低，阻力不断增大。这种情况可以根据观察结果得到明显的证实。当轨道降低到一百公里高的时候，阻力将增加到使卫星和运载火箭灼热，使它们进一步迅速下降而烧毁。
    卫星存在的时间取决于卫星在大气中所受阻力的大小。显然，运行周期越大，阻力越小，那末卫星存在的时间也就越长。根据观测第一个卫星和运载火箭所得资料进行计算的结果，可以推测，卫星存在的时间从发射时算起应为三个月左右。也就是说，第一个卫星在轨道上存在的时间将维持到1957年年底。运载火箭比第一个卫星存在的时间要短些。因此可以预料，运载火箭的烧毁要比卫星为早。第二个卫星的运行周期较大，所受的阻力的作用比第一个卫星要小，因此可以断定，第二个卫星在轨道上运行的时间将显著的超过第一个卫星。
    根据目前研究轨道演变的结果，可以确定卫星轨道参数演变的全部过程，并获得有关大气上层的密度分布的重要情报。将来能够可靠地预测人造地球卫星存在的时间。
    人造地球卫星的观测工作
    六十六个专门光学观测站、苏联所有的天文台和大约三十个外国天文台在对头两个地球卫星和第一个卫星的运载火箭的运行情况进行有系统的光学观测。现在正在各人民民主国家组织光学观测站网。对人造卫星进行系统观测的外国天文台的数目每天在增加。由于运载火箭和第二个卫星的巨大亮度，水文气象机关的高空气象站只要有测风经纬仪，也可以进行目测。
    用光学仪器观测的结果表明，运载火箭的亮度常常改变。这同它在空间方向的改变有关。根据目测，亮度改变的最短间隔大约是二十秒钟。
    在肉眼观测的同时，还对运载火箭和第二个卫星进行照相观测。根据普尔科沃天文台、哈萨克共和国科学院天体物理研究所天文台、哈尔科夫国家大学天文台和苏联其他天文机关所拍摄的照片，以及紫金山天文台（中华人民共和国）、爱丁堡天文台（英国）、丹辛克天文台（爱尔兰）、波茨坦天文台（德意志民主共和国）等所拍摄下来的照片，可以核实卫星和运载火箭的轨道。
    对于人造地球卫星的无线电观测提供了极为丰富的资料。位于不同经纬度的无线电观测站、苏联支援陆海空军志愿协会俱乐部、很多高等学校和成千上万的无线电爱好者都进行了这种观测。所得到的资料异常广泛，目前才仅仅完成了它们的初步整理工作。
    测量从卫星上收到的无线电讯号的强度具有十分重大的意义。这种测量通过两种办法进行，一种是不断地自动纪录，另一种是在一定的时间内进行局部测定。根据测量无线电讯号的强度的结果，可以估计电离层吸收无线电波的情况，其中包括主要电离层F2电离强度最大区之上的区域，这是在地面用一般测量法不能达到的区域。根据这些测量还可以断定无线电波在电离层中传播的可能路径。
    收听人造卫星无线电讯号和测量无线电讯号强度的结果表明，波长十五公尺的讯号可以在很远的距离内收到，远远超过可见度。这些距离达到一万公里、一万二千公里、甚至一万五千公里，有时还更远。
    特别值得注意的是：当卫星在椭圆形轨道上运行时，对于地球大气中电子浓度最大的区域的相对位置时时有所不同。在研究无线电观测材料时要考虑到，卫星在当时一瞬间究竟位于F2层最大电子浓度的真正高度之上，还是位于它的下面。（这个电子浓度是根据电离层站所摄下的电离层高频率特性而得到的）卫星在南半球运行时高于电离层，而在北半球，它有时高于最大电离层。有时低于最大电离层，又有时靠近最大电离层。这种情况在无线电短波远距离传播的路线上造成很大的差异。这种路线之一就是，经过整个电离层射下来的电波，从地面反射上去，接着又从电离层中临界频率具有极大值的地方反射一次。在另外的情况下，以某一角度从上面落到电离层的无线电波在电离层中受到相当大的折射，并因此射入几何学直线可见度范围之外的地区。
    卫星靠近大气最大电离层的位置，可以造成良好的条件来用电离层的无线电波导传播无线电波。据观测证明，在某些情况下，无线电波不是通过最短距离到达接收地点，而是绕过地球沿着大圆形的长弧到达接收地点的。在个别情况下出现了无线电讯号的回声绕地球一周的现象。在某些情况下讯号的强度比原来按照它和距离成反比例的定律计算的距离大。这也就说明电离层有波导存在。
    把人造卫星发射的无线电波的频率同本机振荡器的振动频率之间拍击音的改变用磁带记录下来，就可获得有关都普勒效应的有意义的结果。这些记录很多，正在整理中。
    毫无疑问，用无线电观测人造地球卫星所得到的大量材料最后处理出来后，将提供有关电离层上部电离作用的特点以及无线电波在电离层这一部分中被吸收的情况和传播的性质的宝贵材料。
    第二个卫星的构造
    如上所述，苏联第二个人造地球卫星与第一个卫星不同的地方在于：它是火箭的最后一级，其中装有全部科学测量仪器。这样安置仪器，使得依靠光学观测仪器确定卫星位置的任务大大简单化了，因为第一个卫星的经验证明，观测运载火箭比观测卫星要简单得多。运载火箭的亮度要比第一个卫星的亮度超过好几个星等。第二个卫星上各种仪器、试验动物和电源设备的总重量为五○八·三公斤。
    在最后一级火箭前部的框架上装着研究太阳在短波紫外线和X射线光谱段的辐射的仪器、带有无线电发报机及其他仪器的球状容器、装有试验动物（狗）的密封舱。研究宇宙线的仪器装置在火箭体上。安装在框架上的仪器和容器由专门的圆锥形保护体保护着，使之不受火箭在大气的稠密层飞行时产生的空气动力和热力的影响。当最后一级火箭飞上轨道后，圆锥形保护体即自行脱落。
    装在球形容器内的两台无线电发报机分别以四○·○○二和二○·○○五兆赫的频率工作。无线电发报机的电源设备，温度调节装置和记录温度变化和其他参数的灵敏仪器也装在这个容器内。这个球形容器在结构方面和苏联第一个人造地球卫星相似。
    频率为二○·○○五兆赫（波长为十五公尺）的无线电发报机的讯号采用电报讯号的形式。每个讯号持续时间和间隔时间一样，平均约为○·三秒。当球形容器内部的某些参数（温度、压力）变化时，讯号持续时间和间隔时间也在一定范围内变化着。
    频率为四○·○○二兆赫（波长为七·五公尺）的无线电发报机在连续发报的状态下工作。由于安装了两台用上述波长的无线电发报机，保证了研究从卫星上发射出的无线电波的传播和测量其轨道参数的工作。同时也保证了在电离层的任何状态中都能从卫星上收到讯号。波长的选择以及无线电发报机的足够的能量使广大的无线电爱好者同专门观测站一样有可能对卫星进行无线电观测。
    装有实验动物（狗）的密封舱呈圆筒形。为了建立动物正常生存的必要条件，里面储备着食物，还有由还原设备组成的空气调节系统和温度调节系统。此外，舱内还装有记录脉搏、呼吸、血压的仪器，获得心动电流图的仪器，还有测量舱内情况（温度、压力）参数的灵敏元件。
    动物舱和球形容器是用铝合金制成的。它们的表面光滑，并且经过特别加工，以使它们的表面具有辐射和吸收太阳辐射能的必要系数值。球形容器和动物舱内所装置的温度调节系统使它们的内部能够保持一定温度，由于气体的强制循环，热被送到外壳。
    除了上述设备外，火箭最后一级体内还装置有：无线电遥测仪器、测量温度的仪器以及供应科学仪器和测量仪器电源的设备。动物舱表面和内部的温度以及各个仪器和结构部分的温度，由它们上面装置的温度材料发送机来确定。无线电遥测装置保证卫星的一切测量材料发播到地球上来。根据专门的图表，无线电遥测装置定时开动播发测量材料。
    有关观测第二个人造卫星的科学研究计划，规定为七个昼夜。现在，这个计划已经完成。卫星的无线电发报机以及无线电遥测装置已经停止工作。今后对于第二个人造卫星运行的观测以及研究大气高层的特性和对卫星运行的预测将用光学仪器和雷达设备来进行。
  在人造地球卫星
  上的科学测量
    人造地球卫星使科学家破天荒第一次可以在大气高层进行种种以前做不到的实验。
    太阳的短波辐射
    研究太阳短波紫外线辐射对于物理学、天体物理学和地球物理学具有头等重要的科学意义和实践意义。近年来的研究表明，太阳除可见光以外，还具有波长范围很广的辐射，这种辐射从波长约数亿分之一公分的X射线一直到波长数公尺的无线电波。
    太阳光谱短波一端的辐射（即远紫外线和X射线的辐射）以及无线电辐射同很少研究过的太阳大气外层发生的物理现象（色球和日冕）有关，并且对地球大气有极大的影响。太阳色球的基本辐射集中于位于远紫外光谱段的波长一千二百一十五埃（一埃等于一亿分之一公分）的氢光谱线上，而日冕辐射则集中于三至一百埃的软性X射线光谱段内。由非常稀薄的物质组成的日冕具有将近一百万度的温度，而且看来日冕内某些区域的温度比这还要高。到目前为止，日冕的性质还在很大的程度上是个谜。
    太阳短波辐射的总能量不算大——它比太阳发射出的可见光线的能量弱数万倍，然而正是这种辐射对地球上的大气起着特别大的影响。这是因为短波辐射具有极强的活动力，能够使空气分子电离，形成电离层，即被强烈电离的大气高层。按目前的见解，处在七十到九十公里高的电离圈的下层（D层）是由色球所发射出的氢光谱线辐射使空气分子电离所形成的，而其上的一层（九十到一百公里高的E层）是由日冕的X射线辐射形成的。
    太阳上层和电离层的状况并不是固定的——而是在不断变化着。已经确定，太阳活动（即所谓色球爆发现象）和电离层中无线电波的吸收（这种现象会使无线电联系中断）有着密切的联系。因而人们推想，太阳短波辐射强度的变化同电离层中发生的过程有直接联系。
    地球的大气层完全吸收了太阳的紫外线辐射，只放过靠近可见光谱紫边的近紫外线辐射部分。地球大气层的这个吸收作用使生物机体免受对他们有害的太阳短波辐射的影响。但同时，它使得在地球上没有可能来研究这种辐射。空气的分子的吸收能力大到如此程度，以致必须把仪器装到人造地球卫星上，完全越出大气层以外，才能观察这种短波辐射。虽然使用高空火箭已经获得了良好的结果，但是只有利用卫星才有可能在研究短波紫外线辐射强度的变化所必需的一段长时间内进行系统的测量。
    三个互成一百二十度夹角的特种光电倍增管被用作辐射的接收器。每个光电倍增管都顺序地复盖着几个滤波器，这些滤波器由薄金属片和有机胶片以及由特种光学材料制成，这样就能分出太阳光谱X线部分的各个波段和远紫外线部分和氢光谱线。向阳的那个光电倍增管所发出的电讯号经过无线电线路的放大就依靠遥测装置而发送到地球上来。
    由于人造卫星对太阳的方位不断改变以及一部分时间在背阳的轨道上运行，为了节省电源，只有在太阳照到三个光线接收器中的一个的时候，仪器的电路才打开。打开电路，是靠同时带有光电倍增管的、受到太阳照射的光电阻和自动装置来实现的。
    在从卫星上观察太阳辐射的同时，根据国际地球物理年的计划进行工作的地球上整个太阳联合观察网也在对太阳进行观察。这些观察由天体物理观测台、电离层研究站和太阳辐射接收站来进行。把所有这些观测结果作一番比较之后就能得出关于太阳的紫外线辐射和X线辐射同太阳的色球和日冕所发生的过程的关系以及同地球大气层状况的关系的初步结论。这些材料可以作为今后进行系统观测的根据。
    宇宙线的研究
    在宇宙空间中，各种元素的原子核不断在加速，并且获得巨大的能量。由此而产生的宇宙线使得有可能研究离开地球非常远的宇宙，甚至离太阳系非常远的宇宙。宇宙线从发源地到地球的途中受到它所通过的介质的影响。由于一系列过程的结果，这种辐射的成份和强度都有改变。例如，遇到太阳在发生强烈性爆发以及为原子核加速到具有很大的能量创造了条件的时候，宇宙线的粒子数量就有增加。太阳上所产生的宇宙线的额外增加量就是由此而形成的。
    太阳又是微粒辐射的源泉。在微粒射辐流中有很强的磁场和电场，它们对宇宙线有影响。依靠宇宙线可以研究离开地球很远的微粒辐射流。
    宇宙线的粒子在通过地球磁场的时候，在磁场中强烈的偏转。只有那些具有非常强的能量的粒子才能够毫无阻碍地达到地球的任一地区。粒子的能量越少，这些粒子所能达到的地球上的地区范围也就越小。能量小的粒子只能达到北极和南极地带。这样，地球仿佛被一个能量屏障所包围，这个屏障在赤道地带最高。地磁纬度越高，屏障越低。只有带一百四十亿电子伏特以上能量的宇宙线中的质子才能到达赤道地区。带有七十亿电子伏特以上能量的粒子能达到苏联南部地区。最后，带有十五亿电子伏特以上能量的粒子都能达到莫斯科地区。在不同纬度上测量宇宙线就可以断定宇宙线中有多少粒子以及它们带多少能量。宇宙线粒子数目同纬度的关系，即所谓纬度效应，确定粒子按能量的分布，即宇宙线的能谱。
    由于宇宙线在宇宙空间发生的一系列过程，宇宙线的数量和成份都在不断改变。在某些情况下，例如，当太阳上发生粒子时，有根据预料，在数量上增加的仅仅是能量小的粒子，能量很高的粒子数量没有改变。与此相反，地球磁场的改变和太阳发出的微粒流对宇宙线的影响，不仅会改变小能量粒子的数量，而且会改变大能量粒子的数量。
    要弄清楚宇宙线所发生的变化的本质，不仅要确定宇宙线的强度增加还是减少这样一点，而且要确定，具有各种能量的粒子数量的变化如何。卫星以每秒八公里的速度运行，它在非常短的时间内就可以从这一个纬度区飞越到另一个纬度区。这样一来，依靠在卫星上对宇宙线的测量，就可以确定这种辐射的纬度效应，从而也可以按能量来确定这种辐射的粒子分布的情况。尤其重要的是，一次就可以进行大量的这种测量。因此，依靠卫星，不仅可以观测宇宙线的强度的变化，而且可以观测它的成份的变化。
    宇宙线中的粒子在卫星上用带电粒子计数器记录下来。带电粒子通过计数器时就发生火花，在由半导体三极管组成的无线电线路中产生脉冲，这种无线电线路的功用是计算宇宙射线的粒子数量，并且在计算了一定数量的粒子后发出讯号。无线电发出关于计算了一定数量粒子的讯号以后，记录工作又再度进行，当计算出同样数量的粒子以后，再发出新的讯号。把记录下来的粒子数目除以计算这些粒子的时间，就能够得出每秒钟通过计数器的粒子数，或称宇宙射线强度。
    卫星上装有两个相同的记录带电粒子的仪器。两个仪器的计数器的轴线互相垂直。
    对卫星所发出的宇宙射线资料作初步研究的结果表明，两个仪器的作用很正常。这些资料清楚地表明，宇宙线的粒子数量视地球磁场纬度而异。研究原始宇宙线中粒子能谱的大量测定结果就可能研究出这个能谱随着时间而发生的变化，并且可能同这段时间内在我们周围的宇宙空间内所发生的过程进行比较。
    对宇宙飞行情况下生理现象的研究
    为了对一系列医学生物学问题进行研究，在卫星上安装有放着试验动物（名叫“莱伊卡”的狗）的特制密封舱、研究动物生理机能的测量装置以及再生空气、供应动物饲料和排除动物生命活动的产物的装置。在设计这种装置时，考虑到最大限度地减少仪器的体积和重量并且使它们的电能消耗减少到最低限度。
    这种装置要工作很长时期，它通过无线电遥测系统保证记录动物的脉搏和呼吸次数及其动脉血压和心脏生理潜能的大小、动物舱内的温度和气压等等。
    为了在动物舱内再生空气和保持必要的气体组成，采用了供应动物呼吸所需的氧及吸收二氧化碳和过剩水气的、具有高度效能的化学化合物。参与化学反应的物质数量是自动调节的。由于在无重量情况下缺乏空气对流作用，所以在动物舱内设有强制通风系统。在动物舱内维持一定气温是由温度调节系统来实现的。为了保证供应动物在飞行时所需的饮食，在容器内设有饲养动物的装置。
    乘坐卫星的狗“莱伊卡”曾预先受过训练，这个动物已逐渐地习惯于穿着特制的衣服长期住在容积很小的密封舱内，习惯了装在它身
  上各部位的记录生理机能的发报机等等。还训练狗习惯于体重突增的作用。在试验台上确定了这个动物对振动作用和其他一些因素的安定性。由于长期训练的结果，这个动物能够在几周内安静地住在密封舱内，这样就保证了能够进行必要的科学研究。
    由于多年来苏联对动物乘火箭飞到一百公里到两百公里高空的短时间飞行进行了事先广泛的试验，现在才有可能研究生物机体在宇宙空间飞行中的生理现象。
    与以往的研究不同，动物在卫星上飞行可能对失去重量的长期影响进行研究。到目前为止，用飞机可以对失去重量的影响进行数秒钟的研究，而通过火箭的垂直发射可以对这种影响进行数分钟的研究。通过卫星飞行就可以对动物机体在失去重量接连几天的条件下的状态进行研究。
    目前正在对执行医学生理学研究计划中所得到的实验资料进行精密仔细的研究。现在已经能够断定，受试验的动物很好地经受住了卫星发射到轨道上去的加速度的长期作用和以后历时数天的失去重量的状况。所得资料表明，动物在整个试验期内的状况是令人满意的。
    毫无疑问，所进行的试验将是对于成功地掌握即将来临的星际飞行事业的巨大贡献，可作为设计保证人能安全地作宇宙空间飞行的设备打下基础。
                      ×　×　×
    苏联发射头两个人造地球卫星是对研究高层大气的重大贡献，并且也扩大了人类认识周围宇宙的范围。同时这也表明我国的科学技术具有高度水平，并且预示了人类能够直接研究全部太阳周围的空间的日子即将到来。
