A So-Called "Free World"

    Man Sells Eyes
    Lebanon’s “Daily News” reported on October 22 that a young man in Sardinia, Italy, is preparing to sell one of his eyes to ensure that his elderly and sick mother can live a relatively peaceful life.
    This twenty-year-old youth, driven by poverty, lives in the Piri area near Cagliari, Italy. He told the press that he is prepared to sell his eye to an unnamed "figure" who is almost completely blind and willing to pay 14 million lira for an eye with special properties.

    人卖眼睛
    黎巴嫩“日报”10月22日报道，意大利撒丁一青年准备出售他自己的一只眼睛，以保证他年迈多病的母亲能过比较平静的生活。
    这位为穷困所迫的二十岁的青年住在意大利卡利阿利附近的皮里地方。他向报界说，他准备把他的眼睛卖给一个尚未透露姓名的某“人物”，这个人几乎完全失明，愿以一千四百万里拉的价钱购买一只特殊性能的眼睛。
