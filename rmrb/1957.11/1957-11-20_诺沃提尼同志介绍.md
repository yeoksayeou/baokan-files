Introduction to Comrade Novotný

    Comrade Antonín Novotný, the new President of the Czechoslovak Republic, is one of the most outstanding fighters of the Czechoslovak Communist Party and the working class.

    Comrade Novotný was born on December 10, 1904, into a working-class family. He worked as a fitter. From his youth, he became a loyal and selfless worker of the Czechoslovak Communist Party. When he turned sixteen, he joined the Party. The revolutionary workers' movement he experienced, and the years of the Communist Party's struggle to establish Lenin's revolutionary line, all tempered him and endowed him with the excellent qualities of a Communist.

    From 1928, Comrade Novotný began to hold a series of leading Party positions. He served as chairman of the District Party Committee and district instructor of the Prague Regional Party Committee. In 1935, he participated in the Seventh Congress of the Communist International in Moscow.

    During the difficult years of 1937-1938 when fascism threatened the Republic, Comrade Novotný served as the Secretary of the Hodonín Regional Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party. Wherever he worked and struggled, the working people recognized Comrade Novotný as a loyal, diligent, and selfless fighter for the rights and freedoms of the Czechoslovak people.

    During the German fascist occupation of Czechoslovakia, when the Communist Party went underground, Comrade Novotný completed many Party tasks. In 1941, he was arrested by the German invaders. Nazi concentration camps could not destroy Comrade Novotný's determination to fight for the freedom of the Czechoslovak working class and all working people. In the concentration camp, he actively participated in underground work.

    After the Soviet army liberated Czechoslovakia, the Czechoslovak Communist Party appointed Comrade Novotný as the First Secretary of the Prague Regional Party Committee. At the Eighth Congress of the Czechoslovak Communist Party held in 1946, he was elected as a member of the Party Central Committee. In 1951, Comrade Novotný was elected as Secretary of the Party Central Committee and a member of the Presidium. In September 1953, he was elected as the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party. Comrade Novotný is also a member of the National Assembly of the Czechoslovak Republic and a member of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the National Front. In these positions, Comrade Novotný has made brilliant contributions to the construction and consolidation of socialism.

    在德国法西斯占领捷克斯洛伐克期间，当共产党转入地下活动的时候，诺沃提尼同志完成了许多党的任务。在1941年，他被德寇逮捕。纳粹集中营不能够摧毁诺沃提尼同志为捷克斯洛伐克工人阶级和全体劳动人民的自由而斗争的决心。在集中营里，他积极参加了地下工作。
    苏联军队解放了捷克斯洛伐克以后，捷克斯洛伐克共产党委派诺沃提尼同志担任布拉格州党委第一书记的职务，在1946年召开的捷克斯洛伐克共产党第八次代表大会上，他被选为党中央委员会委员。1951年诺沃提尼同志被选为党中央委员会书记和主席团委员，1953年9月，他被选为捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会第一书记。诺沃提尼同志还是捷克斯洛伐克共和国国民议会议员和民族阵线中央委员会主席团委员。在这些岗位上，诺沃提尼同志孜孜不倦地为社会主义的建设和巩固，作出了光辉的贡献。
