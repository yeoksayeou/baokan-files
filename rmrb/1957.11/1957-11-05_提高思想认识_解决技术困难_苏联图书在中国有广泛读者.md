    Enhancing Ideological Understanding, Solving Technical Difficulties
    Soviet Books Have a Wide Readership in China
    (Our newspaper reports) From 1950 to September 1957, the Soviet Union supplied China with 40,795 types of books urgently needed for socialist construction, totaling 21,845,600 copies.

    The complete works of Marx and Engels published in the Soviet Union and distributed in China numbered 14,064 copies; the Russian and English editions of Das Kapital totaled 2,481 copies; and the fourth Russian edition of Lenin's Collected Works exceeded 3,000 copies.

    Works by Soviet classical and modern writers such as Leo Tolstoy, Chekhov, Pushkin, Gorky, Alexei Tolstoy, Nikolai Ostrovsky, Ehrenburg, Fadeyev, and Sholokhov, have all been issued in quantities of several thousand copies or more in China.

    The number of Soviet science and technology books distributed in China is not only large but also has experienced a dramatic increase. If 1950 is taken as 100, then 1957 will reach over 478. Engineering and technical personnel and workers at the Shanghai Shipyard, based on a Soviet book "New Volga River Ships," have successively built Volga-type passenger and cargo ships such as the "Xinjiang," "Jiangming," and "Jiangshun." These beautiful and comfortable ships, when they appeared in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, won the praise of passengers. The Shanghai Electricity Meter Factory also, by referring to Soviet technical books, discovered a method for eliminating leakage in potentiometers, improving inspection quality, and also manufactured experimental equipment such as shaft tip heat treatment and anti-splash devices. In the design of electricity meters, the Soviet "Structural Atlas of DC Electricity Meters" has become a reference template for the factory, and some drawings have been adopted in the electricity meters produced by the factory. The Soviet book "Theoretical Basis of Arc Welding Transformers and Generators" promptly solved the work difficulties of the Shanghai Institute of Electrical Science, and similar inspiring examples are too numerous to mention.

    Readers of Soviet books are spread all over the country. With the growth and expansion of the number and scope of distribution, by the end of 1956, the number of distribution points for Soviet books had increased to 121. These distribution points have expanded from large cities to medium and small cities, and the newly established foreign language distribution points are mostly distributed in the key areas of industrial construction throughout the country.

    Recently, a large number of new Soviet books and pictures have been transported to our country and are being supplied to readers in the foreign language departments of Xinhua bookstores and the international bookstore outlets throughout the country. The new books that have arrived include: "Ten Days That Shook the World," "In the Days of the October Revolution," "Great Feat," "For the Motherland," "Industrial Economics and Technological Progress," "Collection of Special Reports from the Great Patriotic War Front," "Soldiers Returning Home," "Economic Issues of Soviet Oil," "Special Reports on Collective Farm Villages," and so on.

    To celebrate the October Revolution Day, Xinhua Bookstore has also printed a large number of beautiful bookmarks and catalogs, which are given to readers who buy books. (Xinhua Bookstore Beijing Distribution Office)

    苏联的科学技术书籍在我国的发行数量不仅多而且有飞跃的增长，如果以1950年为一百，1957年则将达到四百七十八以上，上海船厂的工程技术人员和工人们根据一本苏联“伏尔加河新型船舶”的书，先后修造了伏尔加型的“新江”、“江明”、“江顺”等客货轮。这些美丽、舒适的船舶在长江中下游出现时，博得了乘客们的赞扬。上海电表厂也由于参考了苏联的技术书籍，获得了消除电位差计漏电的方法，提高了检验质量，同时还制造出轴尖热处理、防溅等试验设备。在电表设计中，苏联的“直流型电表的结构图册”，已成为这个厂的参考范本，有些图样已采用在该厂出品的电表中。苏联的“电弧焊接变压器和发电机理论基础”一书，及时的解决了电器科学研究院上海研究所的工作困难，诸如此类令人感奋的事例，是举不胜举的。
    苏联图书的读者遍布于全国各地。随着发行数量和发行范围的增长和扩大，截至1956年底为止，发行苏联图书的据点已增加到一百二十一处。这些发行据点已由大城市扩展到中小城市，新设的外文发行据点，大部分分布在全国各工业建设的重点地区。
