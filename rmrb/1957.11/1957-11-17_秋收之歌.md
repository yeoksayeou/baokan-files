Song of the Autumn Harvest
Zou Difan

Going to the countryside with luggage, we go to the countryside, sunflowers lined up along the road. They resemble a thousand suns, ten thousand suns, how bright the autumn fields are. Chickens crowing in low trees, dogs barking in deep alleys, cattle and sheep wandering behind the earthen houses, the wind blowing the large fields of crops rustling, is this Tao Yuanming's pastoral poetry? No, this is a lyrical movement in the chapter of collectivization. Arriving at a quiet village, only the red pomegranates beside the houses peek at us, children sitting by the door singing "The East is Red" out of sync.
  "Children, we are from Beijing, looking for the cooperative director,"
  "They're all in the fields," they point to the east, where there is an ocean of corn, and happiness is stirring up waves there.

Listening to the morning bell, the rooster is crowing, the bell rings again and again, then white light is painted on the paper window, then the sound of cattle and horses hooves echoes outside the window... Good morning, bell ringer, I send you my earliest song of dawn. You will know that the field dikes separated for thousands of years were built into earthen prisons, without happiness, it is like a prison without sunshine. At this moment, when your bell rings, the sound is the overture to the song of peaceful labor, all the villagers get up at the same time. Working together is a good example of work and life, we also get up at the same time. Go to the water well, wash our faces with the cold water, our minds are clearer, we cannot forget that you gave us food.

Picking corn, for many of us, it is the first time to go to the fields, the first time to go to the fields to pick corn. In a hundred acres of cornfields, from east to west, it's like a swimming competition, jumping into the water. This is the result of hard work, the yellow-green husk and fluff protect the mature corn. What we are picking is the result of enduring spring winds and autumn rains, oil gourds jump away, grasshoppers fly away, let us quickly pick past. From east to west we compete, we understand the meaning of the words "advanced" and "backward," we know that without good labor there will be no results. Our fingers are cut by the leaf stems, our arms are sore and weak, who is it, picking with both hands at the same time, rushing past like running a hundred meters? That's a cooperative member, oh, agricultural labor is not easy.

Moonlit night, we come back from the cornfields, the moon rises in the east, the treetops have sparse stars, we come back from the cornfields, the village has lights like tangerines, the sounds of insects chirping in the fields... Who is saying:
  "Tomorrow we are going back, the cooperative's bean stalks are still scattered on the threshing ground, because of the lack of labor!" Let us take advantage of the moonlit night to make a surprise attack, pile the bean stalks into mountains, gather the bean grains into beads, the power of unity creates new achievements. You take the fork, I take the rake, he takes the broom, we take advantage of the moonlit night to make a surprise attack. At night, the corn sways with dewdrops, exuding fragrance in the moonlight. Huh, where are the cooperative members? Are they all asleep? No, under the lights of the big temple, the debate has just begun, the soil of thought is bathing in the sunshine, and moistened by the spring rain.

    秋收之歌
    邹荻帆
    下乡掮着行李，我们下乡，向日葵在路边排列成行。它仿佛一千个太阳，一万个太阳，秋天的田野多么明朗。鸡鸣矮树，犬吠深巷，土屋后面游走着牛羊，风吹大片禾稼苏苏作响，这是陶渊明的田园诗吗？不，这是合作化的一页抒情乐章。走到一个静静的村子，只有屋边的红石榴向我们探望，孩子们坐在门边不符节拍地把“东方红”歌唱。
  “孩子，我们是从北京来的，找社主
    任，”
  “都下田了，”他们指着东方，那里是玉米的海洋，幸福在那里掀打波浪。
    晨钟听，雄鸡在唱，钟声一声声敲响，随后纸窗上描上了白光，随后牛马蹄声在窗外响……早安啊，打钟的人，送给你，我黎明最早的歌唱。你会知道，几千年分割的田堤筑成过土牢房，没有幸福就像牢房没有阳光。此刻，当你们的钟声敲响，音流是和平劳动颂的序曲啊，全村的劳动者在同一时间起床。共同劳动是工作生活的好榜样，我们也同时起床。到汲水井边，用冰凉的水洗一洗我们的脸庞，我们的头脑更为清醒，我们忘不了是你们赐与了食粮。
    扳玉蜀黍我们好多人是第一次下田，第一次下田扳玉蜀黍。在一百亩玉米田里，从东到西像游泳竞赛，跳下水去。这是辛苦劳动的成绩，黄绿色的衣壳和绒丝保护着成熟的玉米。我们采摘的是熬过春风秋雨的成绩，油蛄蠦跳开吧，蚱蜢飞开吧，我们快快地采摘过去。从东到西我们竞赛，我们认识了“先进”、“落后”的字义，我们知道了劳动不好就没有成绩。我们的手指被叶梗划破，我们的膀子酸痛得没有力气，是谁啊，却左右手同时扳摘，像跑百米那样冲了过去？那是合作社员，哦，农业劳动并不容易。
    月夜我们从玉米田里回来，月亮东上，树梢星稀，我们从玉米田里回来，村子有灯光如橘，四野的虫声唧唧……是谁说着：
  “明天我们要回去，社的豆梗还散在禾场上，为的缺少劳动力！”让我们趁月夜突击，把豆梗堆成山，把豆粒聚成珠，团结的力量创造新成绩。你拿叉，我拿耙，他拿条帚，我们趁月夜突击。夜晚啊，玉蜀黍摇着露珠，在月光下腾着香气。咦，社员们呢？都已睡眠了吗？不，大庙的灯下，辩论会刚刚开始，思想的土壤上正沐着阳光，润着春雨。
