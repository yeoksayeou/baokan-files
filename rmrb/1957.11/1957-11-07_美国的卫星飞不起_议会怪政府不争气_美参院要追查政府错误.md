Xinhua News Agency, Washington, November 6th: US Senate Democratic Leader Johnson announced on November 5th that a subcommittee of the Senate Armed Services Committee would conduct a "thorough investigation" of the US satellite and missile programs.

Johnson said at a press conference that hearings for the investigation might begin at the end of this month, with the aim of "determining ways to accelerate these programs and strengthen US 'security'."

Johnson said, "The recent achievements of Russia are indeed remarkable. The Russians have gone ahead of us (the United States)." He said that merely being alarmed by the US's backwardness in satellites and missiles "will not provide any solutions."

He said that the Soviets had subjected the US to "a technological failure and a propaganda failure," and he criticized the US government's work in this regard, saying, "A weak denial in the face of the facts of life will not strengthen our strength." Johnson said that the Senate investigation would criticize the Department of Defense and government officials directing missile and satellite programs, and would "seek to determine how the mistakes were made and how they can be corrected."

    美国的卫星飞不起  议会怪政府不争气
    美参院要追查政府错误
    据新华社6日讯  华盛顿消息：美国参议院民主党领袖约翰逊11月5日宣布，参议院军事委员会的小组委员会将对美国的卫星和导弹计划进行“彻底的调查”。
    约翰逊在一次记者招待会上说，进行调查的意见听取会可能在本月底开始，这次调查的目的在于“确定加速这些计划和加强美国‘安全’的方法”。
    约翰逊说，“最近俄国的成就的确是值得注意的。俄国人已经走在我们（美国）的前边。”他说，光是对美国在卫星和导弹方面的落后感到惊慌“绝不会提供任何办法。”
    他说，苏联人使美国“遭到了工艺上的失败和宣传上的失败”，他在这方面对美国政府的工作进行了批评，他说，“面对生活事实予以软弱无力的否认不会增强我们的力量”。约翰逊说，参议院进行的调查将要对国防部和指导导弹与卫星计划的政府官员提出批评，并将“设法确定一下错误是如何造成的和怎样才能够改正这些错误。”
