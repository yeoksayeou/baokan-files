    Railway Corps Thanks Soviet Experts
    Lieutenant General of the Railway Corps, Li Shouxuan
    The Railway Corps of the Chinese People's Liberation Army was built and grew up by learning from the experience of the Soviet Red Army and with the help of Soviet experts. In the early days of the establishment of our Railway Corps, dozens of Soviet experts, led by Doronin, Silin, Bagrev, and Shagrov, came to China to help us. They brought valuable experience in railway corps construction and railway repair, which played a huge role in our army's construction and the completion of railway repair tasks. During the more than three years of the national economic recovery period, on the vast land from the Songhua River Bridge in the north to Munan Pass in the south, we repaired and strengthened a total of 2,014 kilometers of lines, more than 1,200 bridges and culverts, 53 water supply stations, and erected more than 60,000 kilometers of communication lines. More than 8,000 meritorious individuals emerged from the troops. Our achievements are inseparable from the help of Soviet experts. The serious, responsible, and enthusiastic spirit of the Soviet experts left a deep impression on the officers and soldiers of our army. Here, on behalf of all the officers and soldiers of the Railway Corps, I would like to express my deep gratitude to the Soviet experts who have helped our army.
    After the start of the First Five-Year Plan, the Railway Corps actively participated in the socialist economic construction of the motherland. In less than four years, it completed the construction of more than 1,200 kilometers of new railways and restored more than 400 kilometers of railways. More than 25,000 model heroes emerged from the troops. In the process of construction, Soviet experts, led by Comrade Lianghovsky, gave us tremendous help. In particular, during the construction of the Yujiang Bridge on the Lizhan Line, when we used pneumatic caisson operations for the first time, Soviet experts Belousov and Karlbinsky went deep into the site, provided specific guidance, corrected the caisson tilt accident, and ensured the early opening of the Lizhan Railway. The famous Soviet blasting expert Comrade Chichikin guided and helped us use the large blasting method for construction, which greatly saved manpower, reduced the amount of engineering work, greatly reduced the project cost, and shortened the construction period, ensuring the completion of the Hexia Railway one year ahead of schedule.
    Soviet experts also helped us build the Railway Corps School. Comrade Kichasov, an expert from the school, actively helped the school build and compiled and provided a large amount of material, making the Railway Corps School a regularized school.
    In order to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution, we must continue to work hard to learn from the advanced experience and advanced science and technology of the Soviet Union, learn from the internationalist spirit and communist labor attitude of the Soviet people, and actively participate in the socialist construction of the motherland.
    Under the glorious banner of the October Revolution, the people and armies of China and the Soviet Union will always advance side by side.

    铁道兵感谢苏联专家
    铁道兵中将　李寿轩
    中国人民解放军铁道兵是在学习苏联红军的经验、并在苏联专家的帮助下建设和成长起来的。在我铁道兵建军初期，以多尔宁、西林、巴格列夫、沙格洛夫为首的几十位苏联专家先后来到中国帮助我们，他们带来铁道兵建设和铁路修复的宝贵经验，这对我军建设和完成铁路修复任务起了巨大的作用。我军在国民经济恢复时期的三年多的时间内，北起松花江桥，南至睦南关的辽阔土地上，共修复和加强线路二千零一十四公里，桥涵一千二百多座，给水五十三座，架设通信线路六万多条公里，部队共涌现出八千多名功臣。我们取得这些成绩，是和苏联专家的帮助分不开的。苏联专家对工作严肃认真、热情负责的精神，在我军官兵中留下了深刻的印象。在这里，我代表铁道兵全体指战员，向曾帮助我军工作的苏联专家同志们，表示深切的感谢。
    第一个五年计划开始后，铁道兵部队积极参加了祖国社会主义的经济建设，在不到四年的时期内，共计完成新建铁路一千二百多公里，恢复铁路四百多公里，部队涌现出二万五千多名功臣模范。在建设的过程中，以梁霍夫斯基同志为首的苏联专家给了我们巨大的帮助。尤其是黎湛线的郁江大桥施工，我们第一次使用气压沉箱作业，苏联专家别洛乌索夫和卡尔滨斯基同志，深入现场，具体指导，纠正了沉箱倾斜事故，保证了黎湛铁路提前通车。苏联著名的大爆破专家契契金同志，指导帮助我们使用了大爆破方法施工，大量节省了人工，减少了工程数量，大大降低了工程造价和缩短了工期，保证了鹤厦铁路提前一年完成。
    苏联专家还帮助我们建设了铁道兵学校。学校专家祁洽索夫同志积极的帮助学校建设，编写和提供了大量材料，使铁道兵学校建设成为一个正规化的学校。
    为了庆祝十月革命节四十周年这个伟大的节日，我们必须继续努力学习苏联先进经验和先进的科学技术，学习苏联人民的国际主义精神和共产主义的劳动态度，积极参加祖国的社会主义建设。
    在十月革命的光辉旗帜下，中苏两国人民和两国军队永远并肩前进。
