Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 26th. Since the sensation caused by the Soviet "Tu-104" aircraft in August last year, a series of new giant jet airliners designed by Tupolev and others, such as "Tu-104A," "Tu-110," "Tu-114," and by Antonov and others, such as "Ukraine," and by Ilyushin and others, such as "Moscow," have emerged from the Soviet Union. These aircraft carry more passengers, have a larger payload, fly faster, fly higher, and have a longer range, and each one is better than the last, surpassing the level of the most advanced capitalist countries. In the past twenty years alone, the flight speed of aircraft designed by the famous aircraft designer Tupolev has increased fourfold, and the flight altitude has increased from 6,000 meters to more than 13,000 meters. Flight costs are decreasing daily; the ticket price for the newly manufactured "Tu-114" airliner is already close to the train ticket price for the same distance. Now, Soviet aircraft are able to fly at speeds one and a half times faster than the speed of sound. Due to the creation of sealed cabins and special air compression devices, flying at an altitude of fifteen to twenty kilometers is now commonplace. Soviet scientists are confident that flying at an altitude of twenty-five to thirty-five kilometers is a perfectly achievable task.

Currently, all aspects of the Soviet aviation industry have leaped to the forefront of the world. In the field of helicopter manufacturing, the new "Flying Car" helicopter designed by Soviet aircraft designer Yakovlev is about twice the size and weight of foreign aircraft of the same type. The "Flying Motorcycle" designed by engineer Kamov has received widespread attention for its lightness and agility. The "Mi-4" helicopter designed by Mil, the chief designer of the experimental factory of the Soviet Aviation Industry Ministry, set a world record for helicopter flight speed, and his "Mi-6" helicopter surpassed the American record by more than double in terms of payload at an altitude of 2,000 meters.

In addition, the Soviet Union is also working on solving the design and manufacturing problems of nuclear-powered aircraft and jet helicopters. The jet helicopter experimental aircraft that has already been manufactured solves a series of specific problems for the future manufacture of giant jet helicopters that can travel at three times the speed of sound, accommodate dozens of passengers, and do not require runways.

The brilliant achievements of the Soviet aviation industry are inseparable from the superiority of the socialist system. Before the October Revolution, Russia had only about ten semi-handicraft workshops-style so-called aviation enterprises that mainly manufactured aircraft designed by foreign countries, with only one factory manufacturing Russian-designed "Russian Knight" and "Muromets" aircraft.

Under the attention of the Party and the government in the Soviet era, a series of aircraft and engine manufacturing factories were built in the Soviet Union as early as the First Five-Year Plan. During the Second Five-Year Plan, the total output value of the aviation industry increased by 4.5 times. During the Second World War, the Soviet aviation industry made a great contribution to the motherland. In the last three years of the war, aircraft production reached 40,000 per year. After the war, the Soviet aviation industry advanced by leaps and bounds. The use of aircraft is becoming more and more widespread, not only in transportation and national defense but also in medical care and agriculture.

Currently, the Soviet Union is designing aircraft for everyday use. For example, an agricultural single-propeller engine aircraft designed by Antonov can take off and land on any road and rural street without any airport. Soviet scientists express their belief that in ten years, Soviet propeller aircraft will become as common and necessary in agriculture as tractors or combine harvesters are today. The sowing, topdressing, chemical weeding, and pest control of certain crops in agriculture will all be carried out by aircraft. Taking weeding as an example, the efficiency of aircraft weeding is thousands of times greater than that of manual labor.

The socialist system allows workers and scientists to freely unleash their creativity and enthusiasm. Ilyushin, who designed various "Il" aircraft, was an ordinary worker at the airport before the October Revolution. Mikoyan, the designer of the "MiG" aircraft that made the enemy famous, and the famous aircraft designer Yakovlev were only teenagers during the October Revolution. They have all grown into world-renowned aircraft designers under the kind care of the Soviet Party and government. Zhukovsky, known as the father of Russian aviation, received only indifference and ridicule from the Tsarist government before the October Revolution. In the early years of the Soviet regime, the Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute, headed by Zhukovsky, was established with the direct participation of Lenin, allowing this outstanding scientist to make great contributions to the motherland. Many people in the aviation industry have been awarded the title of Hero of Socialist Labor, and thousands of staff members have received various Soviet medals and awards.

    居世界首位的苏联航空工业
    多种新式巨型喷气客机都超过了最先进的资本主义国家水平；直升飞机也比美国的强；不仅在交通运输、国防方面，并在医务、农业方面使用也日益广泛。
    新华社莫斯科26日电　从去年8月苏联“图—一○四”式飞机轰动世界以来的一年多时间里，从苏联又连续不断地传出图波列夫等人设计的“图—一○四A”、“图—一一○”、“图—一一四”，安东诺夫等人设计的“乌克兰”，伊柳辛等人设计的“莫斯科”等许多种新式巨型喷气客机。这些飞机载客多，载重量大，飞得快，飞得高，续航力强，而且是一种胜似一种，超过了最先进的资本主义国家水平。最近二十年来，仅著名飞机设计师图波列夫设计的飞机的飞行速度就提高了四倍，飞行高度从六千公尺增加到一万三千多公尺。飞行成本日益降低，最近制成的“图—一一四”式客机票价已经接近于同样里程的火车票价。现在，苏联飞机已经能够用比音速快一倍和一倍半的速度来飞行了。由于密封机舱和专门空气压缩装置的制成，飞到十五到二十公里高空已经是平常现象。苏联科学家们满怀信心地认为，在二十五到三十五公里的高空飞行是完全可以实现的任务。
    现在，苏联的航空工业各个方面已经跃居世界前列。在直升飞机的制造方面，苏联飞机设计师雅科夫列夫设计的新型直升飞机“飞行车厢”，在体积和重量方面都为外国同类型飞机的两倍左右。卡莫夫工程师设计的“飞行摩托”则以其轻便灵巧受到了普遍注意。苏联航空工业部试验工厂总设计师米尔设计的“米—四”式直升飞机创造了直升飞机飞行速度的世界纪录，他所设计的“米—六”式直升飞机在升高两千公尺的载重纪录方面比美国高出了一倍以上。
    此外，苏联还在解决原子能飞机和喷气式直升飞机的设计和制造问题。现在已经制成的喷气式直升实验飞机，为今后制造三倍于音速、可容纳数十名乘客而无须跑道的巨型喷气式直升飞机解决了一系列的具体问题。
    苏联航空工业的光辉成就同社会主义制度的优越性是分不开的。十月革命以前，俄国只有十家左右主要是制造外国设计的飞机的半手工业作坊式的所谓航空企业，仅有一家工厂制造俄国自己设计的“俄罗斯勇士”式和“穆罗美茨”式飞机。
    而在苏维埃时代党和政府的重视之下，早在第一个五年计划期间，苏联就建成了一系列飞机和马达制造工厂。在第二个五年计划期间，航空工业总产值增加了四点五倍。在第二次世界大战期间，苏联航空工业对祖国做出了巨大贡献。到战争的最后三年，飞机产量达到了每年四万架。战后，苏联航空工业更是一日千里地飞跃前进。不仅在交通运输、国防方面，在医务、农业等方面飞机的使用也日益广泛。
    目前，苏联正在设计便于日常使用的飞机。例如，设计师安东诺夫设计的一种农业用的单螺旋桨发动机飞机可以在任何道路上和农村的街道上起飞和降落，而无须任何机场。苏联科学家表示相信，十年后，苏联螺旋桨飞机将像目前农业中的拖拉机或收获联合机一样成为农业中常见和必要的东西。农业中某些作物的播种、追肥、化学除草、消灭害虫的工作都将用飞机来进行。以除草工作为例，飞机除草效率要比人工大几千倍。
    社会主义制度使工人和科学家可以自由地发挥他们的创造性积极性。曾经设计了各种“伊尔”式飞机的伊柳辛在十月革命前是飞机场的普通工人，使敌人闻名丧胆的“米格”式飞机的设计师米高扬和著名的飞机设计师雅科夫列夫在十月革命时都还只是十来岁的儿童，他们都在苏联党和政府的亲切关怀下成长为世界闻名的飞机设计师。被称为俄罗斯航空之父的茹科夫斯基在十月革命前从沙皇政府那里得到的只是冷漠和嘲讽，而在苏维埃政权最初年代中，就在列宁的直接参加下建立了以茹科夫斯基为首的中央航空水力动力学研究所，让这位卓越的科学家对祖国做出了巨大的贡献。航空工业中许多人荣获社会主义劳动英雄称号，数以千计的工作人员获得了苏联各种勋章和奖章。
