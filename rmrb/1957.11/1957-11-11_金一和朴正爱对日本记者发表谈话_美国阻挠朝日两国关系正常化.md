Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 10th. Kim Il, Vice Premier of the DPRK Cabinet, and Pak Jeong-ae, Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea, met with Japanese television and radio reporter Kiyoshi Sakurai and others visiting North Korea on the 9th, and gave talks on issues such as the peaceful reunification of Korea, the normalization of relations between North Korea and Japan, and world peace.

    Kim Il said in his speech that we especially hope to normalize our relations with our neighbor Japan and promote economic and cultural exchanges between the two countries. We have been working towards this. But regrettably, normal relations between the two countries have not yet been established, and this is entirely the result of obstruction by the United States and the unfriendly attitude of the Japanese government.

    Kim Il said that if the Japanese government is willing to negotiate with us on the normalization of diplomatic relations and economic and cultural exchanges between the two countries, we can agree to do so at any time.

    Kim Il emphasized that in recent years, contacts and exchanges between the people of North Korea and Japan have become increasingly frequent. Despite the obstacles created by the United States and the Japanese authorities, North Korean and Japanese non-governmental trade groups concluded a trade agreement in September of this year.

    Pak Jeong-ae told Japanese reporters that the call to oppose a new war and to oppose the use of atomic and hydrogen weapons unites hundreds of millions of people around the world. She expressed her respect for the contributions made by the Japanese people, especially Japanese women, in the common struggle of the people of the world to ban atomic and hydrogen weapons.

    Pak Jeong-ae also said that if U.S. imperialism instigates Turkey to finally launch a war of aggression against Syria, it will suffer the same disastrous defeat it suffered in Korea and Egypt.

    金一和朴正爱对日本记者发表谈话
    美国阻挠朝日两国关系正常化
    新华社平壤10日电　朝鲜内阁副首相金一和朝鲜劳动党中央委员会副委员长朴正爱在9日接见了来朝鲜访问的日本电视广播记者樱井清等，并且就朝鲜的和平统一、朝日两国关系的正常化以及世界和平等问题发表了谈话。
    金一在谈话中说，我们特别希望使我们同邻国日本的关系正常化，并且促进两国的经济、文化交流。我们一直为此进行努力。但是遗憾的是两国的正常关系至今还没有建立，这完全是美国的阻挠和日本政府的不友好态度所招致的结果。
    金一说，如果日本政府愿意同我们就两国邦交的正常化和经济、文化交流等问题进行协商，我们随时都可以同意进行。
    金一强调说，近几年来，朝日两国人民之间的接触和往来日益频繁。尽管美国和日本当局在制造障碍，今年9月间朝日民间贸易团体还是缔结了贸易协定。
    朴正爱对日本记者说，反对新战争和反对使用原子武器和氢武器的呼声，团结着全世界的亿万人民。她对日本人民，特别是日本妇女在世界人民禁止原子武器和氢武器的共同斗争中所作出的贡献表示敬意。
    朴正爱还说，如果美帝国主义嗾使土耳其终于发动侵略叙利亚的战争，它就要遭到曾经在朝鲜和埃及遭到过的惨败。
