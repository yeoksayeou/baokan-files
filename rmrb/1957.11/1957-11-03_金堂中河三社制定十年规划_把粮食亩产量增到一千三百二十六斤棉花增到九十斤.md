    Jin Tang Zhonghe Third Cooperative Formulates Ten-Year Plan
    Increasing Grain Yield to 1326 Jin Per Mu and Cotton Yield to 90 Jin

    Chengdu, November 2nd (report from this newspaper) Inspired by the National Agricultural Development Program, the Zhonghe Third Cooperative of Zhaodu Township, Jintang County, Sichuan Province, has formulated a ten-year long-term plan with the goal of achieving a grain yield of 1326 jin per mu and a cotton yield of 90 jin per mu.

    For the past two years, this cooperative has achieved bumper harvests annually, with grain yields reaching 734 jin per mu and cotton yields at 52 jin. Many cooperative members believed that production had reached its peak, with no further potential for improvement. However, after extensive debate on the two roads, the cooperative members' enthusiasm for production greatly increased, and the beautiful prospects outlined in the National Agricultural Development Program brought them infinite confidence and strength. To fulfill the goals set by the program, all cooperative member representatives and experienced farmers held meetings to study various measures for tapping into the potential for increased production, increasing the output of grain, cotton, and fruit trees, taking into account the specific characteristics of the cooperative.

    The cooperative has seventy-five mu of sandy land with very low yields, sometimes even resulting in no harvest. To improve yields, everyone decided to turn the sand, carry soil, and improve the land, as well as reclaim fourteen mu of sandy wasteland. These two measures alone are expected to increase grain production by 280,000 jin within ten years. To increase fertilizer application, in addition to vigorously accumulating and producing manure and planting green manure, it is required that the number of pigs raised per household be increased from the current one and a half to five, and the amount of fertilizer applied per mu be increased from the current 4,800 jin to 10,000 jin. At the same time, it was decided to build a five-li-long canal and repair two flood control dikes more than two li long next year to overcome common floods and droughts. (Fan Yinghui)

    金堂中河三社制定十年规划
    把粮食亩产量增到一千三百二十六斤棉花增到九十斤
    本报成都2日电　粮食亩产一千三百二十六斤，棉花亩产九十斤，这是四川省金堂县赵渡乡中河三社在农业发展纲要鼓舞下制定的十年长远规划。
    两年来，这个社连年丰收，粮食亩产已达七百三十四斤，棉花五十二斤。不少社员认为生产到顶，再无潜力可挖了。经过两条道路的大辩论，社员生产情绪大大提高，农业发展纲要的美好远景更给社员带来无限信心和力量。为完成纲要提出的奋斗目标，全社社员代表和老农召开会议，结合本社特点，研究了多方挖掘增产潜力，增产粮食、棉花和果木的措施。
    全社有七十五亩是沙滩地，产量很低，甚至颗粒无收；为提高产量，大家决定翻沙担土，改良土壤，并开沙荒十四亩，仅此两项，十年内即可增产粮食二十八万斤。为增施肥料，除大力积肥、造肥、种植绿肥外，要求毛猪由目前每户一头半增到五头，每亩施肥量由现在的四千八百斤增到一千斤；同时决定明年兴修五里长的水渠一条，修补两里多长的防洪堤两条，战胜一般的水旱灾。　　（樊映辉）
