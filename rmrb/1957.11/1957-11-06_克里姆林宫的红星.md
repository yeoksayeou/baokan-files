    The Red Stars of the Kremlin
    In the days when the great October Revolution's fortieth anniversary is fast approaching, Moscow's artisans and high-altitude specialists have inspected the mechanics of the five red stars atop the Kremlin's spires, refurbished the glass, and overhauled the frameworks.
    Speaking of Moscow, people always mention the five red stars of the Kremlin soaring into the clouds. Anyone coming to Moscow will first come with reverence to admire Red Square, pay homage to the Lenin and Stalin Mausoleum, visit the Kremlin, and look up at these five great red stars. Visitors new to Moscow, if they get lost, can recognize the direction by simply looking at these red stars. The Kremlin's red stars have become a symbol of the capital of the first socialist country, and how passionately poets and artists have sung and depicted them.
    These five red stars were installed on the spires of the five tallest towers of the Kremlin in October 1937. Their sizes are not exactly the same; the lightest one weighs a ton, and is installed on the Vodovzvodnaya Tower, with each corner being three meters apart. The red star on the Spassky Tower (that is, the Kremlin Clock Tower) is the largest, with each corner being three point seven meters apart. These five red stars are so heavy, but they are mounted on bearings, so when the wind blows, they will rotate with the wind. During the day, they shine with golden light, and at night, they radiate ruby-like light.
    The operation of these five red stars is concentrated in a central control room. Here, craftsmen are on duty day and night.
    Every late night, people still brave the light chill of early winter to stroll on Red Square and nearby streets, admiring the panoramic view of the Kremlin under the shining red stars. The great festival is coming soon, and guests from all over the world will come to Moscow. People will raise their heads and look up at the red stars of Moscow, the red stars of the Kremlin.

    克里姆林宫的红星
    在伟大的十月革命四十周年快要来临的日子里，莫斯科的工匠和高空作业的专家们检查了克里姆林宫尖塔上五颗红星的机械，修饰了红星的玻璃，检修了红星的骨架。
    提起莫斯科来，人们都要提到克里姆林宫的这五颗高耸入云的红星。来到莫斯科的人，谁都会首先带着崇敬的心情，来瞻仰红场，拜谒列宁斯大林陵墓，参观克里姆林宫和仰望这五颗大红星。初到莫斯科的旅客，如果迷了路，只要看到这几颗红星就可辨认出方向来。克里姆林宫的红星成了第一个社会主义国家首都的象征，多少诗人和艺术家们曾经多么热情地歌颂过和描绘过它们。
    这五颗红星是1937年10月安设在克里姆林宫五座最高塔楼的尖顶上面的。它们的大小不完全一样，最轻的一颗也有一公吨重，它安在沃多符兹德纳亚塔楼上，每个角的距离是三公尺。斯巴斯基塔（就是克里姆林宫钟楼）上面的红星是最大的一颗，它的每个角的距离是三点七公尺。这五颗红星是那么重，可是它们是装在轴承上的，风吹的时候，就会顺着风旋转。白天，它们闪耀着金光，晚上，它们放射着红宝石般的光芒。
    操纵这五颗红星的工作集中在一个中心的管理室里面。这里，日夜都有工匠守候着。
    每天深夜，红场和附近的街道上都还有人冒着入冬的轻寒散步，欣赏红星闪耀下的克里姆林宫全景。伟大的节日就要来到了，全世界的客人们都将来到莫斯科。人们将抬起头来，仰望这莫斯科的红星，克里姆林的红星。
