Comprehensive report by our newspaper: According to Xinhua News Agency: On the 24th, the Syrian side lodged an urgent complaint with the Syrian-Israeli Mixed Armistice Commission, accusing Israel of deliberately intruding into the demilitarized zone between Syria and Israel.

A formal statement issued by the Syrian military stated that forty Israeli workers, led by an armored vehicle, departed from the Israeli residential area of ​​Sheri Ashov and entered the northern part of the demilitarized zone, "attempting to forcefully cultivate Arab land, despite Arab farmers working on these lands."

The statement said that the Israeli armored vehicle opened fire on the Arabs. The Arabs retaliated in self-defense, and after ten minutes of mutual shooting, they drove the Israelis back. There were no Arab casualties.

Syrian newspapers said on the 24th that the military and diplomatic contacts between Washington and Tel Aviv prove that Israel is involved in the new anti-Syrian conspiracy of the United States revealed by the Soviet "Izvestia."

Officials in Damascus are watching the situation vigilantly and with confidence.

A Syrian military spokesman said on the 24th that the number or deployment of Turkish troops gathered in the border area has not changed. He made these remarks when commenting on a broadcast by Mecca Radio. According to Mecca Radio, Turkey had notified the King of Saudi Arabia that Turkey had decided to withdraw a large portion of its troops from the Syrian border after the completion of military exercises.

    以色列又侵犯叙边境非军事区
    土耳其军队仍在叙边境集结和挑衅
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：叙利亚方面24日向叙利亚—以色列混合停战委员会提出紧急控诉，指责以色列有意侵入叙利亚和以色列之间的非军事地区。
    叙利亚军方发表的一个正式声明说，四十名以色列工人从谢里阿绍夫的以色列居民区出发，由一辆装甲车引导，进入非军事区的北部，“企图以武力耕种阿拉伯土地，尽管有阿拉伯农民在这些土地上耕作”。
    声明说，以色列装甲车对阿拉伯人开火。阿拉伯人为了自卫而进行了反击，在互相射击十分钟以后，他们把以色列人赶了回去。阿拉伯人没有伤亡。
    叙利亚报纸24日说，华盛顿和特拉维夫之间的军事和外交接触证明，以色列同苏联“消息报”所揭露的美国的新的反叙阴谋有关。这家报纸说，以色列军队现在正在叙利亚南部边界靠近泰比里亚斯一带集中，并且在埃及边界和靠近加沙的地带集中。大马士革官方人士正警惕地和有信心地注视着局势。
    另据塔斯社特拉维夫22日讯：“晚报”报道，以色列国防部办公厅主任佩雷斯和外交部政治顾问希洛阿最近将访问西欧许多国家的首都，其中包括波恩，“目的是研究以色列和北大西洋公约组织之间建立联系的可能性”。
    叙利亚军方发言人24日说，集结在边境地带的土耳其军队的数目或者部署都没有改变。他是在评论麦加电台的广播时说这番话的。据麦加电台说，土耳其曾经通知沙特阿拉伯国王，土耳其决定在军队演习结束后，从叙利亚边境撤退一大部分军队。
    据悉，土耳其巡逻队23日曾渗入阿勒颇以西、哈里姆附近的叙利亚领土。它们在遇到叙利亚人民抗敌军的士兵后退却。
