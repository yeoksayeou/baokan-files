Xinhua News Agency, 10th: San Francisco dispatch: U Thant, the Burmese representative to the United Nations, said on November 8 that the United States' policy of not recognizing China is "meaningless" and "needs a thorough re-examination and re-evaluation."

	U Thant pointed out that in Asia, "the opinions of no more than two or three leaders are close to the United States' attitude toward China." Some neutral countries in Asia find it difficult to understand the United States' attitude of not having diplomatic relations with China and prohibiting American citizens from traveling to China and trading with China.

	U Thant also criticized the United States for obstructing the restoration of China's legitimate seat in the United Nations. He believes that doing so will only harm the United Nations, because the United Nations will "therefore not be regarded as an effective tool for international reconciliation." He pointed out that due to the United States' "ambiguous attitude" towards colonial issues and its "failure to understand the Asian mindset," the United States has lost many friends in Asia.

	U Thant also criticized the United States' "foreign aid" policy. He expressed doubt about the United States' practice of "dumping millions of dollars into the coffers of undemocratic, corrupt, and discredited regimes," and said: "The struggle to win the minds of billions of people cannot be won simply by giving them better materials and more gasoline."

    缅甸驻联合国代表指出
    美对华政策需要重新审查
    不承认中国的作法是毫无意义的
    据新华社10日讯　旧金山消息：缅甸驻联合国代表吴丹11月8日说，美国不承认中国的政策是“毫无意义的”，“需要彻底重新审查和重新估价”。
    吴丹指出，在亚洲，“没有两三个领袖的意见是接近于美国对中国的态度的”。亚洲的一些中立国家很难了解美国不同中国发生外交关系并且禁止美国公民同中国来往和进行贸易的态度。
    吴丹还批评美国阻挠恢复中国在联合国中的合法地位。他认为，这样做只会使联合国受到损害，因为联合国会“因此而不被人当作国际和解的有效工具”。他指出，由于美国对殖民地问题的“暧昧态度”和“没有能够了解到亚洲人的思想”，美国在亚洲已失去许多朋友。
    吴丹也对美国的“援外”政策提出了批评。他对美国“把成百万美元倾倒在不民主、腐败和声誉扫地的政权的国库里”的作法表示怀疑，并且说：“争取亿万人民思想的斗争，是不能只依靠给他们更好的原料和更多的汽油就可以取胜的。”
