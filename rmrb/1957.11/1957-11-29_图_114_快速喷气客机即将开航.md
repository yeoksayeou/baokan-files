Xinhua News Agency, 28th: TASS reports: The newly manufactured Soviet "Tu-114" rapid jet passenger plane will soon be operating on domestic and international routes.

This aircraft, designed under the leadership of Academician Tupolev of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, is the fastest of the existing turbojet propeller passenger planes. In terms of passenger capacity, payload, engine horsepower, and non-stop flight range, it is unparalleled in the world.

The aircraft is equipped with four turbojet propeller engines, which have almost twice the horsepower of similar foreign engines. The aircraft is also equipped with the latest aerial navigation, radio navigation, and autopilot equipment, enabling it to fly under any conditions, day or night. It can fly non-stop from Moscow to Vladivostok, Beijing, Tokyo, Yangon, or Washington in ten to twelve hours.

The "Tu-114" is a cantilever monoplane with swept wings and tail. It is intended for the transport of passengers, luggage, and mail on intercontinental and intercontinental routes.

The standard "Tu-114" has two levels, upper and lower. The upper level has three large passenger cabins and seven compartments. The forward cabin has forty-one seats. The middle cabin is a restaurant type, with forty-eight seats. The aft cabin has fifty-four sofa chairs. Each seat has a single small table for reading, writing, or knitting. Each compartment has six seats or three berths. The lower level has many luggage compartments that can accommodate fifteen to sixteen tons of cargo. In addition, there are kitchens, restrooms, and rooms for storing clothing.

The standard "Tu-114" can carry one hundred and seventy passengers, while the "Tu-114" for intercontinental flights can carry one hundred and twenty people, all in berth seating. For routes such as Moscow to Tbilisi, Sverdlovsk, or Riga, it can carry two hundred and twenty people.

All cabins maintain normal air pressure, temperature, and humidity. The aircraft also has two elevators for transporting food and various other amenities for passengers.

On such a large aircraft, the crew consists of eight people: two pilots, a navigator, a flight engineer, a radio operator, and three stewardesses. Due to the reduction in flight costs, the cost of flying on this aircraft is close to the cost of train travel. (Attached pictures)

    “图—114”快速喷气客机即将开航
    新华社28日讯　据塔斯社消息：苏联新制成的“图—114”快速喷气式客机最近就要在国内和国际航线上行驶了。
    这种在苏联科学院院士图波列夫领导下设计的飞机是现有的涡轮喷气螺旋桨客机中最快速的一种。就其载客数目、载重量、发动机马力和不着陆飞行的路程说来，都是举世无匹的。
    飞机上装有四部涡轮喷气螺旋桨发动机，这种发动机比外国同类型发动机的马力差不多要高一倍。飞机上还装有最新式的空中领航、无线电导航和自动驾驶设备，可在昼夜任何条件下飞行。它可以在十到十二小时之内不着陆飞完从莫斯科到海参崴、北京、东京、仰光或华盛顿的路程。
    “图—114”式飞机是一种具有箭形机翼和尾翼的张臂式单翼飞机。它是供洲内和洲际航线上运送乘客、行李和邮包用的。
    普通型的“图—114”式飞机内分上、下两层。上层有三个大客舱和七个房舱。头舱有四十一个座位。中舱是餐厅型的，有四十八个座位。尾舱有五十四个沙发椅。每个座位前都有单人小桌子，可供看书报、写字、打毛线之用。每个房舱设有六个座位或三个卧铺。下层有许多行李舱，能容纳十五到十六吨重的货物。此外，还有厨房、盥洗室和存放衣物的房间。
    普通型的“图—114”式飞机可以载一百七十名乘客，供洲际飞行用的“图—114”式飞机可以载一百二十人，其中全是卧铺席位。供从莫斯科到第比利斯、斯维德洛夫斯克或里加这样的航线用的则可载二百二十人。
    所有机舱都保持着正常气压、温度和湿度。飞机上还有两部输送食物的电梯和为乘客服务的各种其他设备。
    在这样大的飞机上，乘务人员一共有八人：两位驾驶员、一位领航员、一位随机工程师、一位无线电报务员和三位女服务员。由于飞行成本的降低，乘这种飞机的费用接近于乘火车旅行的费用。（附图片）
