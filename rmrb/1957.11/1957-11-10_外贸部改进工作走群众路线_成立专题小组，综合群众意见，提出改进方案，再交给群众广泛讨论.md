Xinhua News Agency, November 9th: Since the Ministry of Foreign Trade entered the third stage of the rectification campaign in mid-October, more than 7,500 big-character posters have been put up, offering many criticisms and suggestions regarding its work. The leadership of the ministry is continuing to mobilize the masses to speak out freely, studying the opinions of the masses, and starting to improve its work.

So far, according to statistics from twenty-eight units, including the China Minerals Company, the masses have offered more than 18,000 suggestions on various aspects through big-character posters and other means. The big-character posters show that the current focus is on organizational structure and problems existing in business operations, as well as manifestations of bureaucratic work styles. For example, many people at the China Minerals Company criticized the unreasonable organizational structure in big-character posters. They said that the current organizational division of labor is: one section manages the source of goods; the second section trades with the Soviet Union and new democratic countries; and the third section trades with capitalist countries. This divides a single product into three parts, which not only wastes manpower but also sometimes leads to mutual buck-passing, affecting work efficiency. Some criticized the practice of changing the organizational structure three times in one month in 1956. They said that due to bureaucracy and subjectivism on the part of the leadership, and the idea that "more people make things easier," the organization was changed repeatedly, resulting in an increasingly bloated organization, overstaffing, and inefficiency.

Many big-character posters demanded improvements in enterprise management. One big-character poster, titled "How to Cure the Problem of Unclear Financial Records," proposed establishing inventory quotas, strengthening verification systems, and dividing inventory between the head office and branches to grasp the commodity inventory situation in a timely manner. A big-character poster titled "One Number, Three Sets of Statistics" revealed the following: due to each department using its own set of statistics, over two thousand tons of coal were over-delivered in a foreign trade deal, causing the state a loss of more than six thousand yuan.

Many big-character posters also criticized specific managers by name for not going deep into the grassroots, for being un-receptive to criticism, and for not adhering to labor discipline.

Many criticisms were also made about the phenomenon of overstaffing in big-character posters. For example, China National Metals and Minerals Import Corporation has five managers and one commissioner. The masses believe that there are too many managers and that the number should be reduced to improve work efficiency and to correct the bureaucratic work style of delays in leadership and slow document turnaround. China National Technical Import Corporation has a total of 210 people, with non-business personnel accounting for more than 25%. The Petroleum Department of China National Import and Export Corporation currently has three section chiefs, seven business personnel, one clerk, and one statistician. A proposed streamlined organizational structure from the masses could reduce personnel by half.

The leaders of most units have attached great importance to the opinions of the masses. In order to resolutely, thoroughly, and quickly make changes, the ministry has established special business groups, organizational structure groups, and personnel and welfare groups to study improvement plans separately. They have also begun to address some urgent issues in pricing, transportation, warehousing and packaging, division of responsibilities, and work systems. Regarding organizational issues, three plans have been submitted to each unit for discussion. Regarding business issues, nine major problems have been identified, and preliminary solutions have been proposed, which will soon be submitted to the masses for broad debate. In the rectification and reform process, some leaders have sincerely accepted the opinions of the masses and earnestly corrected their undesirable work styles. For example, in the past, Vice Minister Fan Ziwen's instructions on requests for instructions and reports were sometimes ambiguous, and the response time was relatively long. Now, he has accepted the opinions of the masses and has made improvements. The managers of the China Tea Company accepted the criticisms of the masses and began to change their long-standing work style of not going deep into the grassroots. Recently, two deputy managers went deep into the branches to inspect work and study problems.

    外贸部改进工作走群众路线
    成立专题小组，综合群众意见，提出改进方案，再交给群众广泛讨论
    据新华社9日讯　对外贸易部从10月中旬转入整风第三阶段以来，已贴出了七千五百多张大字报，提出了许多有关工作的批评和建议。这个部的领导上正在一面继续发动群众大鸣大放，一面研究群众的意见，着手改进工作。
    到目前为止，根据中国矿产公司等二十八个单位统计，群众通过大字报等方式对各方面所提出的意见有一万八千多条。大字报表明，现在大家注意的中心是组织机构以及业务方面存在的问题和表现出的官僚主义作风。比如中国矿产公司不少人在大字报中批评了组织机构不合理的现象。他们说，现在的组织分工是：一处管理货源；二处对苏联和新民主主义国家进行贸易；三处对资本主义国家进行贸易。使得一个品种分成三部分，不仅在工作中浪费人力，而且有时互相推诿，影响工作效率。有人对1956年一个月内机构三变的作法提出批评，他们说，由于领导上存在官僚主义和主观主义，存在“人多好办事”的思想，机构一变再变，人员愈来愈多，形成机构臃肿，人浮于事。
    许多大字报要求改善企业经营管理。有一张以“如何医治家底不清的毛病”为题的大字报，提出建立库存定额，加强核查制度以及划分总公司与分公司的库存等办法来及时掌握商品库存情况。在一张题为“一个数字三套统计”的大字报中，揭露了这样一件事情：由于各搞一套统计数字，以致在一次对外贸易中，造成超交两千多吨煤，使国家损失了六千多元。
    还有许多大字报指名指姓的批评有些经理不深入下层、不虚心、不遵守劳动纪律等缺点。
    关于人浮于事的现象，大字报上也提出了许多批评。比如，中国五金进口公司有五个经理，一个专员。群众认为经理太多，应该减少，这样可以提高工作效率，改进领导上的拖拉和文件周转旅行的官僚主义作风。中国技术进口公司共二百一十人，非业务人员占25％强。中国进出口公司石油处，现有三个处长，七个业务人员，一个文书，一个统计。群众提出的一个紧缩机构方案，人员可以减少一半。
    绝大多数单位的领导人都很重视群众的意见，为了坚决地改、彻底地改、迅速地改，这个部成立了专门的业务小组、组织机构小组和人事福利小组，分别研究改进的方案，并且着手解决价格、运输、仓储与包装、职权分工与工作制度等方面存在的一些迫切需要解决的问题。机构方面的问题，已提出三个方案交各单位讨论，业务方面已归纳成为九个大问题，并提出了解决的初步意见，也拟很快交到群众中去大争大辩。在整改中，有些领导人诚恳地接受了群众的意见，认真改正自己的不良作风。如副部长范子文过去对请示报告的指示，有些地方模棱两可，批复时间较长。现在他接受了群众的意见，已经作了改进。中国茶业公司经理们接受群众的批评，开始改变了长期不深入下层的作风。最近两位副经理深入分公司检查工作，研究问题。
