Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 9th — The Yangzhuangzi Pioneer Cooperative in Anxin County, Hebei Province, which has consecutively set the national record for fish production and won the Gold Star Medal for two years, has set a new record for fish production this year.

This year, the cooperative chose an area of 5.5 mu (approximately 0.9 acres), with fast-flowing water and surrounded by reed fields and villages suitable for wind protection, to raise over 10,000 fish fry. Due to the assignment of dedicated personnel for careful management, doing a good job in disease prevention, escape prevention, and regular pond cleaning, using the "four fixings" (fixed time, fixed location, fixed quality, fixed quantity) feeding method, the fish were able to eat a certain amount of fresh forage on time, accelerating the growth rate of the fish. After one year of breeding, a total of more than 10,400 fish were produced, weighing more than 20,000 jin (approximately 10,000 kg), with an average yield of 3,663 jin per mu (approximately 1.83 tons per acre), an increase of 49.5% over last year's yield.

    白洋淀畔的先锋社
    创养鱼丰产最高纪录
    据新华社保定9日讯　连续两年创全国养鱼丰产最高纪录，和金星奖章的河北省安新县杨庄子先锋社，今年又创养鱼丰产新纪录。
    今年，这个社选择在水流大、四周有苇田和村庄易于避风的五亩五分的面积里，放养鱼苗万余尾。由于确定专人精心管理，做好防病防逃和定期清塘等工作，以“四定”（定时、定地点、定质、定量）的饲养方法，使鱼按时吃到一定数量的新鲜饲草，加快了鱼的生长程度。这样经过一年的饲养，共出鱼一万零四百多尾，重二万多斤，平均亩产三千六百六十三斤，比去年亩产量提高49．5％强。
