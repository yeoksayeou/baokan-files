Let the Rectification of the Commune Instructions Reach the Masses!
	Yan Ling

"The Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued some time ago an instruction on rectifying agricultural cooperatives; at the same time, it also issued two instructions: one on implementing mutually beneficial policies and one on improving operation and management. Do the members of your cooperative know about these?" I asked a deputy director of the Dongshuangtang Agricultural Cooperative in Jinghai County. His reply was: "Even I don't know yet!" According to comrades from the local work team, the Dongshuangtang Agricultural Cooperative is a key focus of the county committee's rectification of communes; however, the comrades from the work team have been in the commune for half a month, busy with other things, and have not done any rectification work. They have neither conveyed nor publicized the Central Committee's instructions on rectifying communes to the commune cadres and members, nor have they studied these instructions themselves.

"How did the county committee arrange for the rectification of communes? Did it arrange for publicizing the Central Committee's instructions to the masses?" I asked the first secretary of the Jinghai County Committee. His reply, in essence, was: "When arranging for the launch of the great debate, we arranged to combine it with the rectification of communes and the rectification of the Party. The specific policies for rectifying communes are based on the Central Committee's several instructions, and this has also been explained to the cadres." I also checked the county committee's newspaper, the "Jinghai Daily," which only published an excerpt of one of the three instructions—the instruction on implementing mutually beneficial policies. Why? It is said that only the content of this instruction is suitable for the masses to see, while the other two instructions are only suitable for cadres to see. In fact, which of the three instructions is not something the masses need to understand? Even if the newspaper has limited space, it could still publish a brief news item about the major event of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issuing these three instructions, right? This can only show that the county committee's guiding ideology for rectifying communes is not very clear.

The fact is that, by only casually mentioning "combining it," the vast majority of the masses, even the main cadres in the commune, do not know that the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has issued these instructions. Of course, "combining it" is not wrong in itself, the problem lies in how to combine it. From the preliminary opinions voiced by the commune members, rectifying the work style of the commune cadres, improving labor management and financial management, and correctly implementing mutually beneficial policies are precisely the most urgent demands of the masses. Many people still have concerns, one of the main reasons being that they do not understand whether raising opinions will be useful or not, and whether the leadership supports the opinions of the masses. Vigorously publicizing the Central Committee's three instructions on rectifying communes to the masses is precisely the best way to dispel the masses' concerns and launch a great airing of views, right? Why put such a good weapon aside and not use it, while on the other hand worrying about the lack of enthusiasm for the masses to air their views? If the Party's policies on rectifying and running communes are not grasped by the masses, how can we rely on the power of the masses to rectify and run the communes well? The Party's instructions should never be regarded merely as the basis for cadres to handle affairs, they must also become the direction of action for the masses and become the force for mobilizing the masses.

    让整社指示到群众中去！
    燕凌
    “中共中央前些时发了一个关于整顿农业社的指示；同时还发了两个指示：一个关于执行互利政策的，一个关于改进经营管理的。你们社里的社员们知道吗？”我问静海县东双塘农业社的一位副主任。他的回答是：“连我自己也还不知道哩！”据当地工作组的同志谈，东双塘农业社是县委的整社的重点；可是，工作组的同志到社半月了，还是忙于别的事情，并没有做什么整社工作。既没有向社干部和社员群众传达和宣传中央的整社指示，自己也没有学习这些指示。
    “县委对整社是怎么布置的？布置向群众宣传中央的指示的工作了没有？”我问静海县委第一书记。他的回答，大意是：“在布置开展大辩论的时候就布置了要结合进行整社、整党。整社的具体政策，要根据中央的几个指示，这也向干部交代了。”我又查了一下县委的报纸“静海报”，上面只摘要刊载了三个指示中的一个——关于执行互利政策的指示。为什么呢？据说只有这个指示的内容是适合群众看的，其他两个指示则只是适合干部看的。其实，三个指示中有哪一条不是群众需要了解的呢？报纸篇幅小，也总可以把中共中央发了这样三个指示这件大事登一条简要的消息吧？这只能说明，县委对于整社的领导思想不是十分明确的。
    事实就是如此，只附带地交代一下“结合进行”，结果，广大群众甚至社里的主要干部都不知道中共中央有这么几个指示。当然，“结合进行”并没有错，问题在于究竟怎样结合。从社员群众初步鸣放出来的一些问题看，整顿社干部的作风，改进劳动管理工作和财务管理工作，正确执行互利政策，正是群众最迫切的要求。很多群众还有顾虑，主要原因之一是不了解提了意见究竟管用不管用，不了解领导方面是不是支持群众的意见。大张旗鼓地向群众宣传中央关于整社的三个指示，不正是打破群众顾虑、开展大鸣大放的最好的方法吗？为什么有这么好的武器放在一边不用，另一方面却又发愁群众鸣放的劲头不足呢？党的关于整社、办社政策不让群众掌握住，又怎能依靠群众的力量把社整好、办好呢？党的指示，决不应该只当做是干部办事的依据，也必须使它成为群众行动的方向，成为动员群众的力量。
