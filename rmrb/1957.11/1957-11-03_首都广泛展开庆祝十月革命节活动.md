Xinhua News Agency, November 1st: Huge portraits of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin were hung today in front of the red walls on both the east and west sides of Tiananmen Square. Huge banners celebrating the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution were hung on many tall buildings throughout the city and at the entrances of government offices, factories, and shops. The large-scale activities in the capital to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution have begun.

To date, more than 100 factories, mines, and enterprises have launched celebratory activities, and tens of thousands of workers have heard reports on the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution. Many factories, mines, enterprises, and construction sites are enthusiastically engaged in competitions to dedicate achievements to the great 40th anniversary of the October Revolution. Construction workers at the Beijing Thermal Power Plant construction site have proposed to complete the fourth quarter's production tasks ahead of schedule, and workers at the Xinhua Printing Factory are carrying out a "three goods" competition—good quality, good safety, and good economy. Celebratory activities are also underway in agricultural production cooperatives in the suburbs. The Heping Agricultural Production Cooperative in the eastern suburbs has already held a grand celebration meeting.

Various reports and propaganda activities are very active. Zhang Youyu, Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, delivered a report on October 31st to more than 800 people, including Party workers from Beijing's government offices, organizations, factories, mines, enterprises, schools, and district committee secretaries, on celebrating the October Socialist Revolution. A large propaganda team is going deep into small and medium-sized factories, enterprises, and streets to carry out propaganda activities. The first group of reporters from the CPC Dongdan District Committee has already given more than 20 reports, with more than 10,000 people listening to the reports. Nearly a thousand units throughout the city have held small-scale photo exhibitions such as "The Great Forty Years of the Soviet Union" and "The Great Sino-Soviet Friendship." More than 7,000 propaganda posters are being displayed in shop windows.

Tall colorful arches celebrating the festival have been erected at the entrances of universities and colleges. The Sino-Soviet Friendship Club at Tsinghua University has seen thousands of people participating in various celebratory activities every day for the past few days. Many university students began a symbolic long-distance run towards Moscow from late October, and some schools have already "crossed" Siberia today. At the starting ceremony of the symbolic long-distance run at Tsinghua University on the 30th, veteran athlete Ma John said to more than 9,000 university students: "Run to Moscow and learn the excellent qualities of Soviet youth." He also led the students in running the first leg of 2,000 meters. Many middle schools have opened exhibition halls and exhibition rooms, displaying gifts and correspondence from Soviet friends. The Beijing Children's Palace and the "Children's Homes" in various districts have held more than 20 story-telling sessions about the October Revolution to date.

Artistic activities celebrating the festival have also begun. The Cultural Center of the Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association has been inviting playwrights and others in recent days to introduce the achievements of Soviet films and dramas to art enthusiasts, and has screened Soviet films such as "How the Steel Was Tempered," "A Mother's Duty," and "Whirlwind of Hatred." The actors of the China Acrobatic Troupe began today to perform wonderful programs for Soviet experts, including "Flying Forks," "Tightrope Walking," "Great Martial Arts," and "Strongman," which they learned from the Soviet Circus.

The city's celebration activities are expected to enter a climax in the next two days.
