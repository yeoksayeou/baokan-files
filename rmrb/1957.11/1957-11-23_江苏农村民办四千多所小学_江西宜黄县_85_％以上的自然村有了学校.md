Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 22nd. Agricultural production cooperatives in various parts of Jiangsu Province have established more than 4,200 elementary schools, providing education to 530,000 rural children.

Most of these private elementary schools use public housing provided by the cooperatives, while some are newly built with funds raised by the masses. Desks and chairs are generally brought by the students themselves or borrowed from the masses. The teachers are mostly middle and high school graduates from previous years who did not continue their education. They are enthusiastic and well-received by the farmers. The funding for private elementary schools mainly relies on agricultural cooperatives or tuition fees. Teachers' remuneration also varies: some are paid monthly from the cooperative's public welfare fund or according to the work points of strong laborers; some private school teachers' living expenses are shared by the students' families. Many areas also organize students to fish and grow vegetables to solve the problem of insufficient school funding.

These private elementary schools generally teach according to the curriculum prescribed by the government and meet the requirements of elementary education. In the Xinmin Private Elementary School in Gaozuo District, Suining County, 42 out of 45 students in the last semester achieved a score of four or higher. In the Lu Yuan Private Elementary School, 16 elementary school students from the graduating class of the sixth grade were admitted to junior high school last year. Teachers in private elementary schools in various places receive guidance in teaching from local public elementary schools. They also participate in various political and professional studies under the unified leadership of the local education administrative departments, just like public elementary school teachers. Many agricultural cooperatives also subscribe to newspapers and magazines for private school teachers to read.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 22nd. Yihuang County, Jiangxi Province, now has 147 private elementary schools. Together with 120 public elementary schools, more than 85% of the natural villages in the county have schools, with more than 8,000 children enrolled.

Yihuang County is a mountainous area, and its culture was backward before liberation; it was difficult to find a literate person in several villages. After liberation, with the development of production, the cause of education also greatly developed, but it still could not meet the needs, especially after the realization of agricultural cooperation in 1955, farmers urgently demanded to send their children to school. At this time, the county's Party and government leading organs helped the masses to run their own elementary schools. Each student paid a certain amount of tuition according to their grade level and family economic situation. The school buildings were built by the masses contributing labor and materials. In this way, the masses felt that they were the masters of the school and were particularly concerned about the school and teachers. The teachers were trained by the relevant departments of the county. Because the teachers have received the care and encouragement of the masses, they are all very active in their work.

### 江苏农村民办四千多所小学  江西宜黄县85％以上的自然村有了学校

    江苏农村民办四千多所小学
    江西宜黄县85％以上的自然村有了学校
    新华社南京22日电　江苏省各地农业生产合作社办了四千二百多所小学，有五十三万农村儿童在这些学校里受着教育。
    这些民办小学的校舍大部分是利用社里的公房，有的是由群众集资新建的；课桌椅子一般都由学生自带或向群众借用。教师大都是历届没有升学的中、小学毕业生，他们工作积极热情，很受农民欢迎。民办小学的经费主要是依靠农业社或收学费。教师的酬劳也是多种多样的：有的是农业社按月从公益金中支付，或按照强劳动力记工分；有的民校教师生活由学生家庭分担。很多地区还组织学生捕鱼、种菜，来解决学校经费不足的困难。
    这些民办小学一般都能按照政府规定的课程进行教学，符合小学教育的要求。睢宁县高作区新村民办小学上学期四十五个学生中达到四分标准以上的有四十二人。陆元民办小学去年六年级毕业的一个班中就有十六个小学生考取了初中。各地民办小学教师在教学业务上都得到当地公立小学的辅导。他们也和公立小学教师一样在当地教育行政部门的统一领导下参加各种政治和业务学习。很多农业社还订了报刊、杂志供民校教师阅读。
    据新华社南昌22日电　江西省宜黄县现在已有民办小学一百四十七所，加上一百二十所公办小学，全县85％以上的自然村有了学校，入学儿童达八千多人。
    宜黄县是山区，解放前文化落后，几个村庄找不到一个识字的人。解放后随着生产的发展，教育事业也有了很大的发展，但是还不能满足需要，特别是1955年实现农业合作化以后，农民迫切要求把自己的子女送进学校读书。这时候，县的党、政领导机关便帮助群众自己办小学。每个学生按照自己的学级、家庭经济情况等，缴纳一定的学费。校舍是由群众献工献料建筑的。这样，群众感到自己是学校主人，对学校和教师也特别关心。教师是由县的有关部门培养训练的。教师们由于得到了群众的关怀和鼓舞，工作都很积极。（附图片）
