　　Residents Begin to Speak Out Freely; Leaders Promptly Resolve Problems
　　A Fresh Atmosphere in the Jianxi District Streets of Luoyang

　　(Our newspaper reports) The citizens of Jianxi District, Luoyang City, have begun to speak out freely. After the opinions expressed were promptly processed and resolved, a fresh atmosphere has emerged in the streets.

　　The opinions expressed by the citizens are multifaceted. Among them, the largest proportion concerns issues such as grain supply, the service attitude of state-owned store employees, and the work style of cadres.

　　In July, the entire district experienced a severe grain shortage, with 7,000 out of more than 15,000 households claiming they lacked grain. At that time, although the leadership felt that these claims were unrealistic, they did not know the actual number of households that were truly short of food, or why so many families were making such claims. In mid-September, when residents throughout the district began to speak out freely, the true situation was revealed. After analyzing and verifying the more than 20,000 opinions raised by over 90% of the adult population in youth and elderly forums, informal heart-to-heart talks, street suggestion boxes, and street office reception rooms, the district committee learned that only about 5% of those claiming a grain shortage were truly short. For example, in Block 1 of Wuhan Road, out of 133 households, 25 originally claimed to lack grain. After this free expression clarified the situation, it was found that only one household was truly short of grain. Thirteen households actually had enough but echoed the claims that the grain supply standard was too low due to ideological problems or opposition to the state's grain policy. Six households wasted grain by feeding chickens or throwing it away. The other four households were short of grain due to entertaining guests or relatives staying for extended periods. The reason for the remaining household had not yet been investigated. In Block 7 of Qingdao Road, out of 466 households, 80 originally claimed to lack grain. After this free expression and initial handling, only 4% of the total households were truly short. After understanding the above situation, the leadership had a practical basis for future grain supply, and the masses no longer randomly shouted that there was not enough grain. Furthermore, with the help of street resident groups, they began to formulate plans to save grain.

　　During this period of free expression and rectification while correcting errors, the work of various street offices and state-owned stores throughout the district has improved significantly. For example, the masses strongly criticized the street offices for studying every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday afternoon and for not working after 6:30 pm every day. The staff of the street offices criticized these practices that were divorced from the masses, changed the schedule so that there were always enough people on rotation to handle various affairs during study time, and extended the daily office hours to 9:30 pm, with staff on duty on Sundays. The masses expressed satisfaction with these improvements.

　　The masses also criticized the service attitude of some stores. For example, the Shanghai Market Food Company was accused of showing favoritism in selling meat, where acquaintances could buy good meat and oil without waiting in line, while strangers waiting in line could not buy good meat. The staff at the Wuhan Road Grain Store had a poor service attitude. The butcher shop on this street intentionally made things difficult for the masses when selling meat, forcing customers to take whatever amount was cut. The criticized units and staff publicly apologized to the masses at meetings and immediately corrected their poor management practices and service attitudes.

　　Currently, the movement throughout the district is continuing to deepen. Each street has launched a major debate centered on the grain issue to further raise the socialist consciousness of the masses and distinguish right from wrong.

### 居民开始大鸣大放　领导及时解决问题  洛阳涧西区街道气象一新

    居民开始大鸣大放　领导及时解决问题
    洛阳涧西区街道气象一新
    本报讯　洛阳市涧西区市民开始大鸣大放。鸣放出来的意见经过及时处理和解决后，街道气象一新。
    市民们鸣放出来的意见是多方面的。其中占比重最大的是有关粮食供应、国营商业店员服务态度、干部作风一类的问题。
    7月，整个区里闹缺粮问题很严重，一万五千多户居民中就有七千户喊缺粮。当时领导上虽然感到这种叫喊不切合实际，但是真正不够吃的户有多少，为什么有这样多的人家喊缺粮，心中是无数的。9月中旬全区居民开始大鸣大放，问题的真实情况才揭露出来。区委根据占成年人总数90％以上的人在青年老年座谈会、不拘形式的谈心会、街道意见箱、街道办事处接待室等提出的两万多条意见，进行分析调查对证后，了解到：在叫喊缺粮户中真正缺粮的只占5％左右。例如武汉路一号街坊一百三十三户中，原来喊粮食不够吃的有二十五户，经这次鸣放弄清底细的结果，真正缺粮的只有一户，有十三户实际够吃但由于思想问题或反对国家粮食政策而随声附和喊粮食供应标准太低，还有六户是因为喂鸡、乱扔浪费了粮食，另外四家缺粮户是由于请客或亲属探亲长住造成的。还未调查清原因的一户。青岛路七号街坊四百六十六户居民中，原来喊缺粮的有八十户，经过这次鸣放和初步处理，真不够吃的只占总户数的4％。领导上了解了上述情况，对今后的粮食供应有了切实依据，群众中也不乱叫乱嚷粮食不够吃了，并且都在街道居民组的帮助下开始订节约粮食的计划。
    全区在这次大鸣大放、边整边改中，各街道办事处和国营商店的工作都有了不少的改进。例如群众对街道办事处每星期一、三、五下午学习，和每天下午六时半以后不办公很有意见。街道办事处的工作人员即批判了这些脱离群众的作风，改为学习时仍有足够的人轮班处理各项事务，同时把每天下午的办公时间延长到九时半，星期天也有人值班。群众对这些改进表示满意。
    群众还对一些商店的服务态度提出批评，如上海市场食品公司卖肉耍私情，熟人不站队也能买到好肉和油，生人站队也买不到好肉；武汉路粮店店员服务态度差；这条街上的肉店卖肉时有意为难群众，一刀割下多少就强迫群众要多少等。被批评的单位和工作人员，都在会上公开向群众作了检讨，立刻纠正了不良的经营作风和服务态度。
    目前，全区运动正在继续深入，各街道已经展开了以粮食问题为中心的大辩论，以便进一步提高群众的社会主义觉悟，辨明大是大非。
