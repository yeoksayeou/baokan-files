Seeing the Superiority of the Socialist System from Soviet Higher Education
Jiang Longji, Vice President of Peking University

The October Revolution was the first to turn the socialist ideal into reality. The great Soviet people, as the creators of a socialist society, have set a good example for progressive humanity worldwide and opened up infinitely broad prospects. In the short span of forty years, the Soviet people have created countless miracles and made extremely great contributions to mankind. Today, socialist Soviet Union is second to none in the world, whether in politics, economy, military affairs, culture, education, or science and technology. Here, I will only give a brief introduction to the achievements made by the Soviet Union in higher education over the past forty years. From this perspective, we can also clearly see the superiority of the socialist system.

According to the materials we obtained from our observation in the Soviet Union last year, the Soviet Union had only 105 higher education institutions in the Tsarist era, while in 1956 there were 765, an increase of 7.2 times. The number of students enrolled in the Tsarist era was only 127,000, while in the 1955-56 academic year it was 1,228,000, an increase of nearly ten times. The number of enrollments: in the 1928-29 academic year, only 42,800 people were enrolled, while in the 1955-56 academic year, 285,600 people were enrolled, an increase of nearly seven times in twenty-seven years. Number of graduates: A total of 2.97 million students graduated in the same twenty-seven years. The Soviet Union currently has about two million college students, equivalent to sixteen times that of the Tsarist era, and more than one and a half times the total number of college students in all European capitalist countries combined. This year alone, the Soviet Union has trained 265,000 specialized talents with higher education, which will increase to 315,000 next year. Among the high-level talents trained this year, there are 80,000 engineers alone, which is more than three times the number of engineers trained in the United States this year, and almost twenty-seven times that of the United Kingdom and France. At present, the number of engineers per capita in the Soviet Union is more than twice that of the United Kingdom. Therefore, even officials from countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States cannot but admit that the Soviet Union has far surpassed them in training specialized talents.

Based on our superficial understanding of the Soviet Union last year, I believe that Soviet higher education has at least the following advantages: First, its purpose is to train intellectuals of the working class to serve socialist construction. After the October Revolution, Soviet higher education institutions opened their doors to workers and peasants. The proportion of workers and peasants among students increased year by year, reaching 25.7% in the 1927 academic year (according to statistics from higher industrial colleges), and at the same time, worker departments (equivalent to university preparatory courses) were opened for worker and peasant students. Because Soviet higher education institutions paid attention to enrolling workers and peasants from the beginning, they trained a large number of intellectuals of their own working class. This is the reason why most of the Soviet scientists, professors, and engineers are from worker and peasant backgrounds. In order to train its own working-class intellectuals, Soviet higher education institutions still pay great attention to the composition of new students. Last year, the Soviet government decided that, except for majors such as mathematics, physics, and chemistry, colleges and universities would only admit people who have undergone more than two years of practical work experience. This measure was implemented this year, and more than 60% of the new students enrolled this year have practical work experience. In addition, the Soviet Ministry of Higher Education passed a resolution last winter: in the future, college graduates must go through a probationary period of one and a half to two years before they can be issued graduation certificates and formally assigned work. The stipulations of these systems are of great significance for implementing the principle of combining theory with practice and combining mental labor with physical labor. This is fundamentally different from the situation in capitalist countries where universities mainly absorb the children of the exploiting classes, and the students they train are "exploitation experts" who are divorced from reality and the working people.

Secondly, Soviet higher education institutions adapt to the needs of national construction and train talents in a planned and proportional manner. The establishment of colleges and departments, the setting of departments and the division of majors are all strictly determined according to the needs of national construction. The number of students enrolled each year in various majors (such as literature, law, engineering, agriculture, medicine, science and other departments, as well as each major in each department) maintains a certain proportion. At the same time, the number of students enrolled each year in the same type of major in higher education institutions and secondary vocational schools also maintains a certain proportion. This can ensure that the talents trained by higher education institutions are completely consistent with what they have learned. Of course, it is not easy to accurately match the caliber of talent supply and demand. The Soviet Union has also gone through a long process of exploration in this regard. In the early stage of the First Five-Year Plan and during the Great Patriotic War, the division of majors was too narrow and detailed, which affected the quality of talent and increased the difficulty of job assignment, but they were corrected in time later. At present, the major settings of Soviet higher education institutions are still being adjusted in a broader direction. After decades of experience accumulation, they have now mastered the basic laws of talent supply and demand, so the annual enrollment plan can closely coordinate from top to bottom, left and right, and the annual distribution of graduates can also be done properly, so that each can give full play to its talents. This is in sharp contrast to the situation in capitalist countries where college students are unemployed upon graduation or where what they are using is not what they have learned.

Each major in Soviet higher education institutions has clear training goals and detailed teaching plans. The teaching plan not only embodies the scientific system of the major and the qualities that a socialist construction talent must possess in all aspects, but also embodies the training process and training methods of various professional talents. The obvious characteristics of Soviet teaching plans are the combination of professional education and political theory education, the combination of basic training and professional training, the combination of theoretical cultivation and practical skills cultivation, and the combination of classroom teaching and extracurricular guidance. This kind of scientific and rigorous teaching plan is essential for cultivating socialist construction talents with both ability and integrity, sound physique, who can master the achievements of modern science and technology and master the Marxist-Leninist world view. However, Soviet higher education institutions are not mechanically rigid and unchangeable when implementing teaching plans. Without violating the basic spirit of the teaching plan and without lowering the standards of talent, each school can flexibly apply course arrangements, lecture hours, teaching procedures and training methods according to its specific conditions and different opinions. Higher education institutions with better conditions can also formulate their own teaching plans with the approval of the Soviet Ministry of Higher Education. In short, Soviet higher education is planned education, which is essentially different from the laissez-faire approach of capitalist countries' higher education institutions, where teachers set up courses according to individual needs and students listen to courses according to their interests.

Third, Soviet higher education institutions closely integrate scientific research work with teaching work. Few teachers in higher education institutions do not engage in scientific research. They have never heard of any contradiction between scientific research work and teaching work, because they combine teaching work and scientific research work very well. For example, specialized courses are usually offered on the basis of the scientific research work of the teaching and research office, specialized experiments are often the research work of teachers, teaching assistants or graduate students, and graduation theses and even academic year papers are often part of or closely related to the teacher's scientific research work. In this way, teachers organize everyone around them into their scientific research plans in the teaching process, which creates extremely favorable conditions for the formation of academic schools.

Soviet higher education institutions also attach great importance to cultivating students' scientific research abilities. From the third and fourth grades, college students are assigned to a certain teaching and research office, and under the guidance of teachers and with the help of graduate students, they learn to do research work and cultivate independent working abilities.

In order to further develop the scientific research work of higher education institutions, the Soviet government has taken the following measures last year: First, in the 1957-58 academic year, eighty-five modern scientific research laboratories will be established in twenty-five to thirty higher education institutions. Second, the teaching workload system will be abolished, and the teacher-student ratio will generally be one to ten, so that schools can better allocate resources and carry out scientific research work. Third, business departments are allowed to transfer research institutes with poor conditions or little need to higher education institutions, or to establish scientific research laboratories with higher education institutions through agreements, and to allocate the latest equipment to higher education institutions free of charge. With the active support and encouragement of the Party and the government, the scientific research work of Soviet higher education institutions is advancing by leaps and bounds, and has achieved brilliant results.

Fourth, the teaching and scientific research work of Soviet higher education institutions implement the principle of combining theory with practice. Whether it is the teaching plan issued by the ministry or self-formulated, great importance is attached to the training of practical knowledge and skills. Experimental courses, classroom internships, production internships and teaching internships all occupy an important position in the teaching plan. Each major in the biology and earth science departments has field internships for more than one month almost every year, and physics and chemistry majors stipulate that freshmen must participate in operations in the school's internship factory in order to master basic operation methods such as glass blowing, drilling, and welding. In terms of teaching methods, image teaching methods such as classroom performances and teaching films are also widely used. The teaching syllabus and textbooks pay great attention to reflecting the latest achievements of science and technology, the controversial issues and opinions of various schools in this science, as well as the actual problems existing in the process of production and construction and their solutions.

The scientific research work of higher education institutions is also closely linked to reality, directly or indirectly serving socialist construction. The scientific research plan of higher education institutions can be roughly divided into two parts. One part is an important scientific research plan that has a significant impact on the development of the national economy. This part of the plan is summarized by the Ministry of Higher Education every year and sent to relevant business departments for comments before approval. The other part is a general scientific research plan, which also tries to adapt the teacher's interests to the needs of the country as much as possible. The scientific research results of higher education institutions are also summarized by the Ministry of Higher Education every year, and the implementation plan of scientific research results is compiled and sent to relevant business departments for comments, and relevant business departments designate factories and mining enterprises for trial use, inspection or adoption. In addition, the department or teaching and research office of higher education institutions often signs contracts with relevant business departments or factories and mining enterprises to accept commissions to study a scientific problem in the production process, and the commissioning unit is responsible for providing funds, equipment and materials. Higher education institutions also often jointly hold scientific discussion meetings with relevant business departments, research institutions or factories and mining enterprises, or send scientific personnel to participate in each other's scientific discussion meetings. Through these methods, the scientific research work of higher education institutions is closely linked to the actual needs of national construction and people's lives.

Finally, what must also be mentioned is the fine tradition of hard struggle in Soviet higher education institutions. Because Soviet higher education institutions have developed rapidly, the basic construction is generally still tight except for a few key schools. Classrooms and laboratories generally adopt a two-shift system, and there is no free time from morning to night. Some schools even use corridors as laboratories or classrooms. Sports venues are generally lacking, and student dormitories can only accommodate about half of the students. Students in this city generally commute to school. The number of sets of laboratory equipment is not large, and the circulation system is generally adopted, and the utilization rate is relatively high. The addition of scientific research equipment does not only rely on state funding. Part of it, or even most of it, is solved by signing scientific research contracts with business departments. Many schools manufacture instruments by themselves, which can not only meet the needs of their own schools, but also supply friendly schools. In many laboratories, the equipment used by teachers and graduate students for scientific research is retained for teaching experiments. Therefore, the experiments that can be carried out in the laboratory are often several times more than the experiments stipulated in the teaching plan, so that students can choose to do them according to their needs. The above practices not only save a lot of financial and material resources for the country, but also cultivate a good atmosphere of diligence, thrift and hard struggle among teachers and students. This is particularly worth learning from.

Since 1952, higher education institutions in our country have learned from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and carried out the adjustment of departments and teaching reform. After five years of efforts, great achievements have been made. Higher education institutions before the reform basically belonged to the type of bourgeois liberal universities. The setting of departments was not in line with the needs of national construction. The teaching system and teaching content were mostly copied from European and American capitalist countries. The educational ideology and academic ideology were dominated by idealism. The courses were offered without any plan, the teaching process was lack of organization, and the teaching work and scientific research work were divorced from reality. In the past five years, under the correct leadership of the Party and the government, the active efforts of teachers, students and staff, and the enthusiastic help of Soviet experts, preliminary reforms have been carried out from political ideology to educational ideology, from education policy to education system, from training goals to teaching plans, from teaching content to teaching methods, from teaching organization to administrative institutions. After this series of reforms, higher education in our country has undergone essential changes. In terms of its nature, higher education institutions in our country already belong to the category of socialist universities. Bourgeois right-wingers are unwilling to take the socialist road, so they wantonly slander and denigrate the higher education institutions for learning from the Soviet Union to carry out teaching reform. They obliterate the development and improvement of higher education in our country in the past five years. This is not for anything else, but to carry out capitalist restoration in higher education. We must resolutely expose their conspiracies and completely smash their rampant attacks.

Of course, the reform of higher education institutions in our country has not yet been finally completed. For example, the change of student composition, the ideological transformation of teachers and students, the elimination of the influence of bourgeois ideology in teaching content, the improvement of teaching quality, the implementation of the principle of combining theory with practice in teaching work and scientific research work, the improvement of political theory education and political ideological work, etc., all need to be continuously worked on in the future. This requires us to continue to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union with an unswerving attitude, better combine it with the actual situation in China, carry out in-depth teaching reform, and turn higher education institutions in our country into complete socialist universities.

    从苏联的高等教育看社会主义制度的优越性
    北京大学副校长　江隆基
    十月革命第一次把社会主义的理想变成了现实。伟大的苏联人民，作为社会主义社会的缔造者，给全世界的进步人类树立了一个良好的榜样，开辟了无限广阔的前途。在短短的四十年中，苏联人民创造了无数的奇迹，为人类作出了极其巨大的贡献。社会主义的苏联到今天，无论在政治上、经济上、军事上、文化教育上或科学技术上都是全世界首屈一指的。在这里我只就苏联建国四十年来在高等教育方面所取得的成就作些片断的介绍。从这个角度上也可清楚地看出社会主义制度的优越性。
    根据我们去年这时候在苏联考察所得到的材料，苏联高等学校在沙皇时代只有一百零五所，而在1956年度则有七百六十五所，增加到七点二倍。在校学生数在沙皇时代只有十二万七千人，而在1955—56年度则为一百二十二万八千人，增长到将近十倍。招生数：在1928—29年度只招收了四万二千八百人，而在1955—56年度则招收了二十八万五千六百人，二十七年之间增长到将近七倍。毕业生数：在同上二十七年间共毕业学生二百九十七万人。苏联现有大学生约二百万人，相当于沙皇时代的十六倍，比现在欧洲所有资本主义国家大学生总数多一倍半以上。今年一年苏联培养出来的具有高等教育水平的专门人才就有二十六万五千人，明年将增至三十一万五千人。今年培养出来的高级人才中，光工程师就有八万人，这个数字等于美国今年培养的工程师的三倍多，几乎等于英国和法国的二十七倍。目前苏联按人口平均计算的工程师数比英国要多两倍以上。所以连英美等国的官方人士也不能不承认苏联在培养专门人才上已远远地超过他们了。
    根据我们去年在苏联的粗浅了解，我认为苏联的高等教育至少有以下几个优点：首先它是以培养工人阶级知识分子、替社会主义建设服务为目的的。苏联的高等学校在十月革命后就为工农打开了大门。学生中的工农成份逐年增长，到1927年度工农学生即达25．7％（根据高等工业院校的统计），同时为工农学生开办了工人系（相当于大学预科）。苏联的高等学校因为一开始就注意吸收工农入学，所以它就大批地培养了工人阶级自己的知识分子。现在苏联的科学家、教授、工程师多数是工农出身，就是这个缘故。为了培养工人阶级自己的知识分子，苏联的高等学校至今仍很注意新生的成分。去年苏联政府决定高等学校招生，除数学、物理、化学等专业外，一律只吸收经过两年以上实际工作锻炼的人。这一措施从今年开始实行，本年度所招新生60％以上都是有实际工作经验的人。另外，苏联高等教育部去年冬天曾通过一项决定：今后高等学校毕业生必须经过一年半到两年的见习期，才能发给毕业证书，正式分配工作。这些制度的规定，对于贯彻理论联系实际、脑力劳动与体力劳动相结合的原则，有着十分重要的意义。这和资本主义国家的大学主要吸收剥削阶级的子弟，培养出来的学生都是脱离实际，脱离劳动人民的“剥削专家”的情况，是有根本区别的。
    其次，苏联的高等学校是适应国家建设的需要，有计划地按比例地培养人才的。校院的创办，系科的设置及专业的划分都是严格地根据国家各项建设的需要来决定的。各类专业（如文、法、工、农、医、理各部类以及每一部类的各个专业），每年招生的人数都是保持着一定的比例，同时高等学校和中等专业学校同样性质的专业每年招生的人数也是保持着一定的比例。这样就可以保证高等学校所培养出来的人才完全做到学用一致。当然人才供需的口径一时是不容易对得准确的，苏联在这方面也是经过了长期摸索的过程。在第一个五年计划的初期和卫国战争期间，曾因专业分得过窄过细，影响了人才的质量和增加了分配工作的困难，但后来都及时作了纠正。目前苏联高等学校的专业设置还在继续向宽广方向调整。经过数十年经验的积累，到现在他们已经掌握了人才供需的基本规律，所以每年的招生计划都能做到上下左右密切配合，每年毕业生的分配也能做到各得其所，各展其才。这和资本主义国家的大学生毕业即失业，或所用非所学的情况，形成了鲜明的对照。
    苏联高等学校的每一个专业都有着明确的培养目标和周密的教学计划。在教学计划中不仅体现了本专业的科学体系和一个社会主义的建设人才所必须具备的各方面的素养，而且体现了各项专业人才的训练过程和训练方式。苏联教学计划的明显的特点是业务教育与政治理论教育相结合，基本训练与专业训练相结合，理论培养与实际技能的培养相结合，课堂教授与课外指导相结合。这种科学的严密的教学计划，对于培养德才兼备、体魄健全、既能掌握现代科学技术的成就，又能掌握马列主义世界观的社会主义建设人才，是十分必要的。但是，苏联高等学校在执行教学计划时也不是机械死板，一成不变的。在不违反教学计划的基本精神和不降低人才规格的前提下，各校可以根据自己的具体情况和不同见解，在课程安排、讲授时数、教学程序和训练方式上灵活地运用，条件较好的高等学校经苏联高教部批准，也可以自订教学计划。总之，苏联的高等教育是有计划的教育，它和资本主义国家的高等学校，教师因人设课，学生凭兴趣听课的自由主义的作法，是有本质的区别的。
    第三，苏联的高等学校是把科学研究工作和教学工作紧密地结合在一起的。高等学校的教师很少有不作科学研究的。在他们那里没有听说科学研究工作与教学工作有什么矛盾，这是因为他们把教学工作与科学研究工作结合得很好。例如专门化课程通常是在教研室的科学研究工作的基础上来开设的，专门化试验常常就是教师、助教或研究生的研究工作，毕业论文以至学年论文也往往是教师的科学研究工作的一部分或者与之密切关联。这样教师在教学过程中把自己周围的人都组织在自己的科学研究计划中，而这就替学派的形成创造了极为有利的条件。
    苏联高等学校也很重视培养学生的科学研究能力。大学生一到三、四年级就被分配到一定的教研室，在教师的指导和研究生的帮助下，学着做研究工作，培养独立工作的能力。
      为了进一步地开展高等学校的科学研究工作，苏联政府去年又采取了如下的措施：一、在1957—58年度，在二十五到三十个高等学校设立八十五个现代化的科学研究实验室。二、废止教学工作量制度，师资配备一般按教师与学生一比十的比例，以便学校更好地调配力量，开展科学研究工作。三、允许业务部门将条件较差或需要不大的研究所移交高等学校，或与高等学校协议建立科学研究实验室，并且无偿地拨给高等学校以最新的设备。在党和政府的积极支持和鼓励之下，苏联高等学校的科学研究工作正在大踏步地前进，而且已取得了辉煌的成绩。
    第四、苏联高等学校的教学与科学研究工作是贯彻理论联系实际的原则的。无论部颁的或自订的教学计划，对于实际知能的训练都是很重视的。实验课、课堂实习、生产实习和教学实习都在教学计划中占着重要的地位，生物和地学部门的各专业差不多每年都有一个月以上的野外实习，物理化学专业则规定一年级新生必须在本校的实习工厂参加操作，以便掌握吹玻璃、钻孔、焊接等基本操作方法。在教学方式上，课堂表演、教学电影等形象教学法也被广泛应用。教学大纲和教材十分注意反映科学技术的最新成就，本门科学中所存在着的争论问题和各家的见解，以及生产建设过程中所存在的实际问题及其解决办法。
    高等学校的科学研究工作也是密切联系实际，直接或间接地为社会主义建设服务的。高等学校的科学研究计划大体可分为两部分，一部分是对国民经济发展有重大影响的重要的科学研究计划，这一部分计划每年要由高等教育部汇总起来，送到各有关业务部门征求意见，然后批准。另一部分是一般的科学研究计划，这一部分计划也是尽可能地使教师的兴趣与国家的需要相适应。高等学校科学研究的成果，每年也由高等教育部汇总起来，编制科学研究成果的实施计划，送请有关业务部门提意见，并由有关业务部门指定厂矿企业进行试用、检验或者加以采用。此外，高等学校的系或教研室常常和有关业务部门或厂矿企业签订合同，接受委托，研究生产过程中的某一科学问题，而由委托单位负责提供经费设备和材料。高等学校也常和有关的业务部门、研究机构或厂矿企业联合举办科学讨论会，或互派科学人员参加对方的科学讨论会。通过这些方式，高等学校的科学研究工作就和国家建设和人民生活的实际密切联系起来了。
    最后还必须提到的，就是苏联高等学校艰苦奋斗的优良传统。苏联高等学校由于发展很快，基本建设除少数重点学校外一般还是很紧张的。教室、实验室普遍采用二部制，从早到晚是没有空闲的。有的学校连走廊都利用来作实验室或教室。运动场地一般都感缺乏，学生宿舍只能容纳约半数学生，本市的学生一般都是走读的。实验室的设备套数不多，一般是采用循环制，使用率比较高。科学研究设备的添置，不单纯依靠国家的拨款，其中一部分甚至大部分是依靠与业务部门签订科学研究合同时解决的。很多学校自己动手制造仪器，除满足本校的需要外，还可供应友校。许多实验室中，教师和研究生做科学研究时用过的设备保留下来，供教学实验用。因此，实验室所能开的实验往往数倍于教学计划所规定的实验，这样就可以让学生根据需要去选做了。上述的做法，不仅替国家节约了大量的财力物力，而且在教师和学生中培养了一种克勤克俭艰苦奋斗的优良风气。这是特别值得我们学习的。
    我国的高等学校，从1952年起，学习苏联的先进经验，进行了院系调整与教学改革。经过五年来的努力，已经取得了很大的成绩。改革以前的高等学校基本上是属于资产阶级自由主义大学那一类型的，系科的设置是和国家建设的需要不相吻合的，教学制度和教学内容大半是抄袭欧美资本主义国家的，教育思想和学术思想是受唯心主义支配的，课程的开设是毫无计划的，教学过程是缺乏组织的，教学工作和科学研究工作都是脱离实际的。五年来在党和政府的正确领导、师生员工的积极努力和苏联专家的热情帮助之下，从政治思想到教育思想，从教育方针到教育制度，从培养目标到教学计划，从教学内容到教学方法，从教学组织到行政机构，都进行了初步的改革。经过这一系列的改革，我国的高等教育已经起了本质的变化。就其性质来说，我国的高等学校已经是属于社会主义大学的范畴了。资产阶级右派分子不愿意走社会主义的道路，所以他们对于高等学校的学习苏联进行教学改革肆意诋毁，横加污蔑。他们把五年来我国高等教育的发展和提高一笔抹杀。这不是为了别的，只是要在高等教育方面进行资本主义的复辟。我们要坚决地揭露他们的阴谋，彻底地粉碎他们的猖狂进攻。
    当然，我国高等学校的改革尚未最后完成。例如学生成分的改变，师生的思想改造，教学内容上资产阶级思想影响的清除，教学质量的提高，教学工作和科学研究工作中理论联系实际原则的贯彻，政治理论教育和政治思想工作的改进等等，都有待于今后的继续努力。这就需要我们以坚定不移的态度，继续学习苏联的先进经验，更好地结合中国的实际，深入进行教学改革，把我国的高等学校变成完全的社会主义大学。
