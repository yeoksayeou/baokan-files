    Written After the National Table Tennis Championships	Sportsman	Beijing Table Tennis Team Instructor Fu Qifang
    The 1957 National Table Tennis Championships, with seven events, concluded on the evening of the 26th. Two hundred and fifty-two male and female athletes from twenty-seven provinces and cities across the country and four sports academies participated in this competition, making it a grand and unprecedented event. This competition can be considered a major review of the strength of table tennis in our country.
    After ten consecutive days of intense competition, Beijing Team One won five championships in men's and women's team events, men's and women's singles, and men's doubles. Beijing Team Two won the mixed doubles championship, and the women's doubles championship went to the Liaoning team. This championship demonstrated the great progress in the technical level of local teams, which is gradually approaching the level of the Beijing team. For example, Qiu Zhonghui was defeated by Li Linshu, Chi Huifang, and Yang Yueying. Many seeded players from the Beijing team, such as Hu Bingquan, Cen Huaiguang, Wang Xitian, Liang Zhitou, Wang Qi, and Zhang Yiqian, were also eliminated by newcomers. The average age of the athletes participating in this competition was twenty-five years old, which is more than two years younger than last year. Among them, seventy-four people were under the age of twenty, accounting for almost one-third, and many teenagers in their teens defeated famous veterans of the past. For example, Zhuang Zedong, one of the winners of the mixed doubles championship, is only sixteen years old this year. This shows that table tennis in our country has improved on the basis of widespread development.
    The physical strength of the athletes is better than in the past, which was also evident in this competition. In the ten days of intense competition, the athletes did not feel excessively fatigued, and they fought tenaciously throughout. Many athletes often lost the first two games, but because they had good physical strength and a strong will, they came back to win three consecutive games in the end. For example, Ye Peiqiong defeated Li Linshu, and Qiu Zhonghui defeated He Shubin. In the team competition between Beijing Team Two and Guangdong Team Two, they also won four consecutive games after falling behind 1-4, turning defeat into victory. In this competition, the athletes all observed discipline and were able to abide by the referee's decisions, demonstrating good moral character. In terms of technique, each player has mastered certain tactics, unlike in the past when they would hit the ball as soon as they saw it, stand next to the table to hit the ball, and could not use footwork to move back and forth, left and right.
    This competition also revealed some problems that still exist in table tennis.
    Apart from a few players whose basic movements are relatively correct and skilled, the basic movements and techniques of many others are incorrect. The arm swing, bending of the legs, and swaying of the waist are uncoordinated when hitting the ball, which greatly hinders the power and accuracy of the hit. Especially for straight-grip players, some people hold the racket vertically when hitting the ball on the forehand, without raising the racket horizontally or semi-horizontally. The arm is extended too straight, making it impossible to exert force on the forehand attack and also making it easy to make mistakes.
    The hit rate is also not high enough. This is because in normal times, the focus is on scoring to win or lose, and basic ball routines are not practiced well enough. If half of the time in each training phase is spent practicing basic ball routines, the technical progress will be faster.
    At present, only a few people can serve various spin balls. Most athletes can only serve backspin balls and cannot serve left and right sidespin balls. Even fewer can serve topspin balls, and the spin is not strong enough. In the future, time should be allocated specifically for practicing serves in training, using arm and wrist strength to rub the upper part (topspin), middle part (sidespin), or middle and lower part (backspin) of the ball.
    The number of table tennis players using various sponge rackets is increasing. Sponge rackets are more difficult to control than rubber rackets, so they have difficulties when facing chop shots. Most athletes have taken a shortcut, using push shots as the main tactic, and neglecting the practice of loops. Although push shots are much easier than loops, it is more difficult to attack when both sides are pushing the ball than to add force to a loop. Therefore, many people cannot attack at all once they use push shots and have to push to the end. This results in losing the initiative. Table tennis players should not be afraid of difficulties and should repeatedly practice loops. When using tactics, they should mainly use loops and only use push shots to deal with extremely spinning or close-to-the-net balls that cannot be hit with force. This will make the threat to chop shots even greater. This is the advantage of table tennis players in our country. Athletes must master excellent looping techniques because almost all players in other countries (except Japan) have a very high chop shot base.
    Some athletes who usually adopt defensive tactics can also counterattack, but the attacking power is too weak, which often leads to a situation of being constantly beaten. For example, Jiang Yongning lost to Wang Chuanyao, and Jiang Yongning and Ye Peiqiong lost to Zhuang Zedong and Zhang Baodi in mixed doubles. This was because Jiang and Ye were often in a passive position, allowing the opponents to find opportunities to launch a fierce attack and score points. In the future, it is necessary to greatly improve attacking power to achieve greater technical progress.
    Although many new forces have been discovered in this competition, the level of table tennis in our country is still far behind other sports. Therefore, it is hoped that sports associations in various regions and physical education teachers in schools will cooperate to vigorously cultivate young players aged fourteen to eighteen. This will ensure that there will be enough new forces in table tennis in the future.

    写在全国乒乓球锦标赛之后	运动健将	北京乒乓队指导  傅其芳
    1957年全国七项乒乓球锦标赛，已于26日晚全部结束。参加这次比赛的有来自全国二十七个省市和四个体育学院的男女运动员二百五十二名，真是规模宏大，盛况空前。这次比赛可算是我国乒乓球运动力量的一次大检阅。
    经过了连续十天的战斗，北京一队获得了男女团体，男女单打和男子双打等五项冠军，北京二队获得混合双打冠军，女子双打冠军是辽宁队。从这次锦标赛中看到地方队的技术水平是有极大的进步，已逐渐和北京队的水平接近。例如丘钟惠败于李麟书、池惠芳、杨月英，北京队许多种子球员胡炳权、岑淮光、王锡添、梁志滔、汪奇、张逸倩等也都给新手淘汰。参加这次比赛的运动员的平均年龄是二十五岁，比去年少了二岁多。其中二十岁以下的有七十四人，几乎占三分之一，许多十来岁的少年打败了过去有名的老将，如获得男女混合双打冠军之一的庄则栋今年才十六岁。这说明了我国乒乓球运动在普遍的开展的基础上有了提高。
    运动员的体力比过去好，在这次比赛中也表现很明显。在一连十天的紧张比赛中，运动员们都没有感到过度的疲劳，他们始终是顽强地战斗着。不少运动员在比赛中往往是先输了二局，但因为他们有良好的体力和坚强的意志，反而在最后反连胜三局。如叶佩琼胜李麟书，丘钟惠胜何淑冰。北京二队对广东二队的团体赛，也是在一比四落后中连胜四场反败为胜的。在这次比赛中运动员们都做到了遵守纪律，都能很好地服从裁判的裁决，表现了良好的道德品质。在技术上，每个选手都掌握了一定的战术，不像过去那样见球就打，站在台旁击球，不能运用步法作前后左右的奔走。
    从这次比赛中也还发现目前在乒乓运动中还存在一些问题。
    除了一部分队员基本动作较正确和熟练外，其余许多人的基本动作和手法不正确，击球时手臂挥动和两腿弯屈和腰部摆动的姿势不协调，这样就大大地妨碍了击球的力量和准确性。尤其是直式握拍选手，有些人在正手击球时，球拍是垂直的，没有将球拍举成横形或半横形，手臂伸得太直，使正手攻球既不能用力又容易失误。
    击球的命中率也不够高。这是因为平时多以记分打输赢，没有很好地练习基本球路。如果在每个训练阶段的计划中，有一半时间是练习基本球路的，这样会使技术进步更快。
    目前只有少数人能发各种旋转球，大部分运动员只能发下旋球，不能发左右侧旋球，能发上旋球的就更少了，而且旋转力不够强。今后在训练中，应该规定时间专门练习发球，运用臂力和腕力去摩擦球的上部（上旋）、中部（侧旋）或中下部（下旋）。
    乒乓运动员使用各类海绵拍的人数日益增多，海绵拍比胶皮拍难控制，因此碰到削球就有了困难。大部分运动员都走了捷径，以搓球为主要战术，而忽略了拉抽的练习。搓球虽比拉抽容易得多，但双方在对搓中要进攻就比拉抽时加力起板的命中率低，因此有许多人一使用搓球就完全不能再进攻，只好搓到底。这样就会失去了主动权。乒乓运动员们应该不怕困难，反复地练习拉抽，在运用战术时应以拉抽为主，遇到对方削球极转或是近网而不能用力时，才以搓球对付，这样对削球的威胁更大。这是我国乒乓运动员的优点。运动员们必需掌握很好的拉抽技术，因为世界各国选手（除了日本）几乎全是具有很高削球基础的。
    有些平时采取防守战术的运动员虽也能反攻，但进攻力量太弱，这样就形成经常挨打的局势。例如姜永宁输给王传耀、姜永宁和叶佩琼混合双打败于庄则栋、章宝娣，都是因为姜、叶经常是处于被动下给对方找到机会后狠狠地突击一下而失分。今后必需大力提高进攻力量才会使技术有更大的进步。
    在这次比赛中，虽发现了不少的新生力量，但是我国乒乓球的水平和我国其他运动项目相比较，还差不少，因此希望各地的体育协会和学校中的体育教师配合起来，大力培养十四岁至十八岁的少年选手。这样才能使今后乒乓运动中出现有足够的更多的生力军。
