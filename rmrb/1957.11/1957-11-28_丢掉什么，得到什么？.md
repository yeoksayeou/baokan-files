    What to Lose, What to Gain?	Mou Yi
    "Actively respond to the Party's call, go to the countryside, go to the labor front, temper yourselves and transform yourselves!" "Support agriculture, build a new socialist countryside!" This has become the common rallying cry of many cadres in state organs. This shows that after the anti-Rightist struggle, everyone's political and ideological awareness has been unprecedentedly raised, and they are full of enthusiasm for building socialism.
    On the issue of cadres going to lower levels to engage in labor training, many comrades have already weighed the pros and cons, reached a correct understanding, made up their minds, and specifically arranged their family affairs, so that as soon as the leadership approves, they can happily go to the agricultural production front. However, there are also some comrades who, although willing to go to the countryside for training, are in a state of ideological contradiction, with many concerns. They believe that "after going to the countryside, there will be no theoretical study like in the organs, and progress will be slow"; therefore, "the gains will not outweigh the losses."
    These thoughts, whether they are personal concerns or mistaken understandings, need to be debated and clarified. For this reason, every comrade participating in agricultural production should carefully and conscientiously calculate such an account: what will cadres lose and what will they gain by participating in agricultural production?
    Will cadres, especially intellectual cadres, who go to the countryside to participate in production, lose anything? Yes, they will. But what is lost is by no means anything good or worth regretting, but precisely what we urgently need to discard. For example: the bourgeois worldview; the bourgeois erroneous views of despising the working people and manual labor; the bad work style of being divorced from the masses and theory being divorced from practice; the selfish and self-interested thinking of pursuing personal comfort and enjoyment, etc. Losing these things is not a loss, but a great and gratifying thing. Without removing these dirty things, we cannot serve the people wholeheartedly. What will we gain by participating in agricultural production? What we can gain is the most basic thing that every revolutionary cadre must possess, and it is also what many of our comrades feel most lacking. For example: the proletarian revolutionary worldview; the production viewpoint, labor viewpoint, and mass viewpoint; the thoughts and feelings of the working people and the fine style of diligence and thrift, etc. A revolutionary cadre without these things cannot have good political qualities. In general, through the tempering of agricultural production labor, we can break with the bourgeois standpoint and establish the proletarian and socialist standpoint. It can be seen that this is not only not a matter of "slow progress" or "gains not outweighing losses," but also a matter of great revolutionary significance.
    Regarding the issues of political study and professional knowledge learning during the period of participation in labor, there should also be a correct understanding. Cadres who are sent to the countryside to participate in labor can still study politics and professional knowledge in their spare time. Not only should every cadre sent down not give up this kind of study, but the leadership also has the unshirkable responsibility to organize and help. Of course, cadres sent to lower levels mainly engage in labor and temper themselves in labor, so the time for studying theory and professional knowledge is not much, and it may not be as regular as studying in the organs. In this respect, learning will be somewhat affected, but this should absolutely not be regarded as a matter of gains not outweighing losses. In fact, the losses are very small, and the gains are very large. Moreover, after labor training, after the issue of standpoint is resolved and the awareness is greatly improved, there is no doubt that there will be faster progress in learning theory and professional knowledge.
    Some comrades may ask: why can participating in productive labor discard the decadent ideas of the bourgeoisie and establish a revolutionary worldview and the thoughts and feelings of the working people? This is because productive labor is a kind of physical labor that creates social wealth. Through the tempering of this kind of labor, on the one hand, it can enable us to personally experience the significance of labor and the greatness of the working people, and on the other hand, because we live with the working people for a long time, eating, living, and working together, it is easy to accept the ideological influence of the working people, so that our own thoughts and feelings undergo qualitative changes, thereby abandoning the decadent ideas of the bourgeoisie and establishing the proletarian standpoint, viewpoint, and method. That is to say, through the practice of labor, we will be transformed into laborers. Since labor can transform us into laborers, then it is not difficult to understand why labor can enable us to abandon the decadent ideas of the bourgeoisie and establish the thoughts and feelings of the working people.
    Is it true that every comrade who goes to the countryside can transform their old and wrong ideas and establish new ideological viewpoints as long as they go through productive labor? It is by no means such an easy thing. Whether or not one can truly transform depends on whether or not one has the determination and perseverance to transform oneself. All comrades who are determined to transform themselves, are not afraid of any difficulties, integrate with the working people, and actively engage in labor training can, after a certain period of time, train themselves into excellent cadres who combine manual and mental labor. If there is no determination to transform oneself, one becomes dejected when encountering difficulties, full of complaints, and full of grievances, or regards participating in physical labor as an extra burden and "great misfortune," then one will not get good training results, and some people may even not be able to withstand this test and become deserters on the road of revolutionary advancement, and be eliminated by the revolution. This cannot but be strictly guarded against.
    Sending cadres to the countryside to participate in labor training is an important method for our Party to cultivate cadres, and it is also an important path for the majority of cadres, especially intellectual cadres, to transform themselves. This is a major plan for consolidating and strengthening socialism for a hundred years, and it has great historical and revolutionary significance. If our broad masses of cadres, especially intellectual cadres, do not make up for this lesson of productive labor, if they are not tempered and tested in labor, they cannot establish a revolutionary worldview of wholeheartedly serving the people, they cannot progress faster, and they cannot contribute everything to the socialist cause. Therefore, every comrade who asks to participate in agricultural production must strictly demand themselves with revolutionary spirit, and temper and transform themselves into loyal revolutionary fighters who serve the people wholeheartedly.

    丢掉什么，得到什么？	牟易
    “积极响应党的号召，到农村去，到劳动战线上去，锻炼自己和改造自己！”“支援农业，建设社会主义的新农村！”这已经成为很多国家机关干部共同的豪言壮语。这说明了大家经过反右派斗争以后，政治思想觉悟空前地提高了，充满了建设社会主义的热情。
    在干部下放进行劳动锻炼的问题上，很多同志已经算过账，有了正确认识，下了决心，并且具体地安排了家务，只要领导批准就可以愉快地走上农业生产战线。但是，也有一部分同志，虽然愿去农村锻炼，思想上却处于矛盾状态，顾虑重重。他们认为“到农村去以后，没有机关这样的理论学习，进步就慢了”；因而“得不偿失”。
    这些思想，不管它是个人顾虑也好，或者是错误认识也好，都有必要展开辩论加以澄清。为此，要求每一个参加农业生产的同志，应该细致地认真地算清这样一笔账：干部参加农业生产，会丢掉什么又会得到什么？
    到农村去参加生产的干部特别是知识分子干部，会不会丢掉什么东西呢？会丢掉的。但是丢掉的东西，绝不是什么好的，值得可惜的东西，而正是我们急需抛弃的东西。例如：资产阶级的人生观；资产阶级的轻视劳动人民、轻视体力劳动的错误观点；脱离群众、理论脱离实际的恶劣作风；追求个人生活的安适和享受的自私自利思想等等。丢掉了这些东西，并不是什么损失，而是一件值得庆幸的大好事，不清除这些肮脏的东西，我们就不可能全心全意为人民服务。参加农业生产会得到什么东西呢？我们所能得到的东西，是每一个革命干部都必须具备的最基本的东西，也正是我们许多同志最感到缺乏的东西。例如：无产阶级的革命人生观；生产观点、劳动观点、群众观点；劳动人民的思想感情和勤俭朴素的优良作风等等。一个革命干部不具备这些东西，他就不可能有优良的政治品质。总起来说，通过农业生产劳动的锻炼，可以使我们破资产阶级的立场，立无产阶级的、社会主义的立场。可见这不但不是什么“进步慢了”“得不偿失”的事情，而且是具有重大革命意义的事情。
    关于在参加劳动期间，政治学习和业务知识学习的问题，也应该有一个正确的认识。下放到农村参加劳动的干部在劳动之余仍然可以学习政治和学习业务知识的。这种学习，不但每一个下放干部自己不应该放弃，领导上也有组织和帮助的义不容辞的责任。当然，下放干部在农村中主要是从事劳动，在劳动中锻炼，因此，不论理论和业务的学习时间是不很多的，也可能没有机关中的学习那样正常，就这一点说，学习会受到一些影响，但是这也绝对不能认为是什么得不偿失，实际上是所失甚小，所得甚大。而且经过劳动锻炼，在立场问题解决以后，觉悟大大提高以后，不管学习理论和学习业务都会有更快的进步，这也是没有疑问的。
    有的同志也许会问：为什么参加生产劳动能够丢掉资产阶级的腐朽思想，建立革命人生观和劳动人民的思想感情呢？这是因为生产劳动是一种创造社会财富的体力劳动，经过这种劳动的锻炼，一方面可以使我们亲身体会到劳动的意义和劳动人民的伟大，另一方面由于我们长期的和劳动人民生活在一起，同吃、同住、同劳动，就容易接受劳动人民的思想影响，使自己的思想感情发生质的变化，从而抛弃资产阶级那些腐朽思想，树立起无产阶级的立场、观点和方法。这就是说，经过劳动的实践，会把我们改造成为劳动者。既然经过劳动可以把我们改造成为劳动者，那末，也就不难理解为什么经过劳动能够使我们抛弃资产阶级的腐朽思想建立劳动人民的思想感情了。
    是不是每一个下乡的同志，只要经过生产劳动就都可以把旧的错误的思想改造过来树立新的思想观点呢？绝不是这样轻而易举的事。能不能真正改造过来，还要看有没有自我改造的决心和毅力。凡是抱着决心改造自己、不怕任何困难、与劳动人民打成一片积极劳动锻炼的同志，是能够经过一定时间把自己锻炼成为体力劳动和脑力劳动相结合的优秀干部的。如果没有自我改造的决心，遇到困难就垂头丧气，牢骚满腹，怨言百出，或者把参加体力劳动看成是额外负担和“大不幸”，那么，就不会得到良好的锻炼结果，甚至会有某些人经受不起这一次考验，变成革命前进道路上的逃兵，被革命所淘汰。这是不能不严加警惕的。
    把干部下放到农村，参加劳动锻炼，这是我们党培养干部的一种重要方法，也是广大干部特别是知识分子干部自我改造的一条重要道路。这是巩固和加强社会主义的百年大计，具有伟大的历史意义和革命意义。我们的广大干部特别是知识分子干部，如果不补上生产劳动这一课，如果不在劳动中得到锻炼和考验，就不可能树立全心全意为人民服务的革命人生观，就不可能更快地进步，就不可能为社会主义事业贡献出一切。因此，每一个要求参加农业生产的同志，都要以革命的精神来严格的要求自己，锻炼和改造自己成为忠心耿耿的、为人民服务的革命战士。
