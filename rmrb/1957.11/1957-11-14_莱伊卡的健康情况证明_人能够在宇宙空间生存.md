Xinhua News Agency, November 13th – The Soviet Union has conducted experiments on weightlessness experienced during human flight and has achieved good results. A recent article in the Soviet newspaper "Trud" discussed this matter.

The author of the article, Aleksiev, said that the experiment was conducted using an aircraft equipped with special equipment. Sixteen people participated in the experiment.

During the flight, the special equipment created a state of weightlessness lasting thirty to forty-five seconds. During this time, eight of the sixteen people felt no discomfort; one scientist participating in the experiment said that the state of weightlessness was the best way for people to rest; five of them experienced hallucinations, feeling as if they were in a state of free fall, or as if they were flying upside down; and one person felt symptoms similar to seasickness.

One thing has been determined: after repeated training in experiencing weightlessness, the human body can adapt to this state. In this way, even in a state of weightlessness during space flight, humans can still accurately orient themselves and perform very precise corresponding actions. (Attached picture)

    莱伊卡的健康情况证明
    人能够在宇宙空间生存
    新华社13日讯　苏联已经进行了人在飞行时发生失去重量的实验，并且取得了良好的效果。苏联“劳动报”最近发表的一篇文章谈到了这桩事。
    这篇文章的作者阿利克西夫说，这次实验是用一架带有一种特殊装备的飞机进行的。十六个人参加了这次实验。
    这架飞机在飞行的时候，通过特殊装备产生了三十秒到四十五秒钟的失重状态。在这一个时间里，十六个人中有八个人毫无不舒服的感觉；一个参加这次实验的科学家说，没有重量的状态成为人们休息的最好方式；其中有五人产生了幻觉，感觉得好像在一种自由降落的状态中，或是好像头朝下颠倒地飞行；还有一个人感觉到和晕船一样的症状。
    有一点已经确定：在重复地经过失重状态的训练后，人的有机体就能适应这种状态。这样，人在宇宙飞行时失去重量的状态下，仍旧能够很好地辨别方向，作十分精确的相应的动作。（附图片）
