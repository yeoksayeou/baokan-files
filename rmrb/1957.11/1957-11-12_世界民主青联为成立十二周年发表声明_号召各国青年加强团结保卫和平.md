Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, November 11th: The Secretariat of the World Federation of Democratic Youth issued a statement on November 10th for the 12th anniversary of the federation's founding.

The statement said that twelve years ago, on November 10, 1945, representatives of thirty million young men and women from sixty-three countries, holding different political and religious beliefs, gathered after the victory of the anti-fascist war to establish the World Federation of Democratic Youth. What young people all over the world deeply cared about at that time was: to defend the peace won at a high price, to eliminate all remnants of fascism, to strive for national independence for all peoples, and to pave the way for a happier future. The establishment of the World Federation of Democratic Youth was a manifestation of this desire.

In the past years, this organization has continuously struggled to win peace and national independence, to strengthen friendship and mutual understanding among young people of all countries, and to safeguard their happy future.

All the activities of the federation are aimed at winning the respect and trust of millions of young men and women on all continents. On the twelfth anniversary of its founding, the federation already has more than two hundred organizations, uniting eighty-five million young men and women in ninety-seven countries.

The statement said that the World Federation of Democratic Youth fully supports the just struggles of the people of all countries for national independence and defense, including the struggles of the youth of Algeria and Syria. The World Federation of Democratic Youth advocates the rapid cessation of thermonuclear weapon tests and the prohibition of such weapons, and calls for countries possessing thermonuclear weapons to reach corresponding agreements; it supports any initiative aimed at defending peace and for the bright future of youth.

The statement also said that now, young people are still facing major issues related to their lives and future. Under the current circumstances, the cooperation between young people and their national and international organizations is more necessary than ever.

The World Federation of Democratic Youth is ready to cooperate with all national and international youth organizations that are willing to contribute to resolving disputes on various issues concerning young people.

The statement expressed greetings to all young people and youth organizations in the world and wished them new achievements in the struggle for peace and to strengthen friendship among the youth of all countries.

    世界民主青联为成立十二周年发表声明
    号召各国青年加强团结保卫和平
    新华社布达佩斯11日电　世界民主青年联盟书记处10日为联盟成立十二周年发表了声明。
    声明说，十二年前，在1945年11月10日，六十三个国家的抱有不同政治信仰和宗教信仰的三千万男女青年的代表在反法西斯战争胜利结束后举行集会，建立了世界民主青年联盟。全世界青年在那个时期所深切关怀的是：保卫以高昂的代价争得的和平，消灭法西斯主义的一切残余，为各国人民争取民族独立以及为更幸福的未来开辟道路。世界民主青联的建立是这种意愿的体现。
    在过去的年月中，这个组织不断地为争取和平和民族独立、为加强各国青年之间的友谊和互相谅解以保障他们的幸福未来而斗争。
    联盟的全部活动都是为了要赢得各大陆千百万青年男女的尊重和信任。在联盟成立十二周年的时候，它已经拥有二百多个组织，团结着九十七个国家的八千五百万男女青年。
    声明说，世界民主青联完全支持各国人民为争取和保卫民族独立所进行的正义斗争，其中包括阿尔及利亚和叙利亚青年的斗争。世界民主青联主张迅速停止热核武器的试验并禁止这种武器，要求拥有热核武器的国家达成相应的协议；支持任何一项旨在保卫和平和为了青年美好未来的倡议。
    声明还说，现在，青年们仍然面临着关系到他们的生活和前途的重大问题。在当前情况下，青年们以及他们的全国性组织和国际性组织的合作比过去任何时候都更加必要。
    凡是愿意对解决青年们在各种问题上的争论有所贡献的一切全国性青年组织和国际性青年组织，世界民主青年联盟都准备同它们合作。
    声明表示向世界上所有青年和青年组织致意，并祝他们在争取和平和加强各国青年友谊的斗争中取得新的成就。
