The great achievement of the October Revolution was the emergence of the first proletarian dictatorship in human history – the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. This opened up an entire era in human history, from the old capitalist world to the new socialist world.

Our people have never forgotten that our own cause of revolution and construction is inextricably linked to the October Revolution. Before the October Revolution, from the Opium War in 1840 to the May Fourth Movement in 1919, the revolutionary struggles of the Chinese people consistently failed to achieve victory, or only achieved temporary and partial victories. Only after the October Revolution, with the establishment of the Chinese Communist Party under the influence of the October Revolution, with the Chinese Communist Party representing the working class to lead the Chinese revolution, and with the assistance of the international revolutionary forces led by the Soviet Union to the Chinese revolution in various ways, did our people achieve a complete national victory after a long and arduous struggle. The great victory of the October Revolution at that time gave the deeply suffering Chinese people great encouragement. The bright path opened by the October Revolution to eliminate national oppression and class oppression pointed out the direction for the Chinese people to move forward. The existence and development of the first socialist country – the Soviet Union – created by the October Revolution, especially the consistent sympathy and support given by the Soviet Union to the Chinese people, further enabled the once isolated Chinese people to obtain the most loyal friends internationally. The most profound, concentrated, and fundamental influence of the October Revolution on the Chinese revolution is, as Comrade Mao Zedong said: "The salvo of the October Revolution brought us Marxism-Leninism." The Chinese Communist Party was established and developed on the basis of the combination of Marxism-Leninism and the Chinese working-class revolutionary movement. Since its establishment, the Chinese Communist Party has regarded Marxism-Leninism as its ideological weapon, and after a long period of effort, combined the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution, which guided the victory of the Chinese revolution and construction. This is also as Comrade Mao Zedong said: "The universal truth of Marxism-Leninism, which reflects the practical struggle of the proletariat worldwide, becomes the invincible weapon of the Chinese people when it is combined with the concrete practice of the revolutionary struggle of the Chinese proletariat and the broad masses of the people."

The October Revolution was a truly great people's revolution. The path of the October Revolution is a true Marxist-Leninist path. The people of every country and nation in the world will inevitably, under the leadership of the working class, follow this path, which is fundamentally the same but has its own characteristics in its expression, towards socialism and communism. It is precisely because our people, under the leadership of the working class, have embarked on this path illuminated by the light of the October Revolution that we have won revolutionary victory and socialist development. It is precisely for this reason that the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party stated in its political report to the Eighth National Congress of the Party: "Although our revolution has many of its own characteristics, the Chinese Communists regard the cause they are engaged in as a continuation of the great October Revolution."

(I)

We Chinese Communists had no experience at the beginning of the revolution. Only after a long period of effort did we learn to combine the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution, and use Marxism-Leninism to correctly solve the problems of the Chinese revolution.

The October Revolution is a model of the close integration of the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism and the revolutionary practice of the masses. The Bolsheviks, led by Lenin, implemented extremely wise political and ideological leadership, while at the same time highly developing the revolutionary enthusiasm of the Russian proletariat and all other working people. It was the close combination of these two aspects that guaranteed the victory of the October Revolution. The fundamental characteristic of Marxism-Leninism is the unity of theory and practice. The October Revolution brilliantly tested and confirmed this characteristic of Marxism-Leninism.

The Chinese Communists, represented by Comrade Mao Zedong, precisely based on the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism, based on the basic experience of the October Socialist Revolution, and proceeding from the principle of the unity of Marxist-Leninist theory and practice, conscientiously studied the objective reality of Chinese society and the objective needs of the Chinese people, conscientiously studied the political, military, economic, and cultural development of China, and conscientiously studied the tradition and experience of the Chinese people's revolutionary practice, thereby formulating the basic line and basic policies to guide the Chinese revolution to victory. It can be clearly seen that although our revolution has many of its own characteristics, in terms of the basic points, the revolutionary road that our people have traveled is precisely the broad road of Marxism-Leninism opened up by the October Revolution.

We know that China was originally a semi-colonial and semi-feudal country. The enemies of the Chinese people were imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. The task of the first stage of the Chinese revolution was to overthrow the joint rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. The enemies of the Chinese people were once extremely powerful. At that time, the Chinese people were deprived of any political freedom and any possibility of peaceful activities. Therefore, the Chinese people had to accept the enemy's continuous anti-people's war and had to use their own sustained people's war relying on the countryside to carry out a long and cruel struggle against the enemy. In China, in the past stage of the bourgeois democratic revolution, the largest revolutionary democrats were the peasants. Liberating the peasants from the feudal land system was one of the basic problems of the revolution. However, the peasants themselves could not organize themselves into an independent political force with a clear revolutionary program. The Chinese national bourgeoisie was also weak economically and politically, and in addition to having a revolutionary side, it also had a compromising side. They were incapable of leading the Chinese people to defeat imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries. What was the most fundamental thing needed for the Chinese revolution? It was what Lenin taught, that the proletariat must and can unite the peasants on its side and become the leader of the bourgeois democratic revolution, and that the proletariat must and can rely on the worker-peasant alliance to carry out the bourgeois democratic revolution to the end. The Chinese Communists precisely followed Lenin's teaching, seized the leadership of the bourgeois democratic revolution from the bourgeoisie, firmly grasped it in the hands of the working class, and then led the Chinese people to defeat imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and opened up the road to socialism for the Chinese people. All this is as Comrade Mao Zedong said: "The entire revolutionary history proves that without the leadership of the working class, the revolution will be defeated. With the leadership of the working class, the revolution will be victorious. In this era of imperialism, no other class in any country can lead any real revolution to victory. The repeated failures of the Chinese petty bourgeoisie and national bourgeoisie in leading revolutions are clear proof of this."

Opening up the history of the Chinese revolution, it can be clearly seen that only the Chinese Communist Party put forward a thorough anti-imperialist and anti-feudal revolutionary program, only the Chinese Communist Party put forward the general line and general policy of "a revolution led by the working class and the broad masses of the people against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism," only the Chinese Communist Party put forward the complete strategy of "developing progressive forces, winning over intermediate forces, and isolating stubborn forces," only the Chinese Communist Party has the great thought of people's democracy that distinguishes and closely links the bourgeois democratic revolution and the socialist revolution, and only the Chinese Communist Party has a clear stance that is consistent with patriotism and internationalism. In a word, only the Chinese Communist Party has this complete, scientific, and great idea about the Chinese revolution. The political and ideological leadership of the Chinese Communist Party transformed the Chinese working class from a class-in-itself into a class-for-itself, united the extremely broad and extremely scattered peasants and made them form a solid alliance with the working class, and won over and united the national bourgeoisie and made them participate in the people's democratic united front led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance. That is to say, the political and ideological leadership of the Chinese Communist Party united all those who could be united, maximized the isolation of the enemy, and maximized the establishment of the ranks of the working-class allies, raising the degree of organization and awareness of the Chinese people to an unprecedented height, thereby transforming the spontaneous struggle of the Chinese people into a conscious revolutionary struggle with leadership, organization, and scientific foresight to guide it.

In this way, the Chinese people, under the leadership of the working class (through the Communist Party), went through all the necessary stages of the bourgeois democratic revolution and embarked on the road of socialist development in the entire historical period from the May Fourth Patriotic Movement in 1919 to the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949. Lenin's policy of directly transitioning from the bourgeois democratic revolution to the socialist revolution guided the development of the Russian February Revolution to the October Revolution in 1917, and also guided the direct transformation of the Chinese bourgeois democratic revolution into the socialist revolution. It was only under the conditions of China that the basic problem of the revolution, namely the problem of political power, was solved through the bourgeois democratic revolution, and political power was seized from the Kuomintang reactionaries from local areas to the whole country, and a state power of people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance was established. Therefore, naturally, the founding of the People's Republic of China became the main symbol of the great victory of the bourgeois democratic revolution and the great beginning of the socialist revolution in our country and was recorded in the historical pages of the Chinese people's revolutionary struggle.

(II)

Now, our people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, are carrying out the great cause of building socialism, which our predecessors have never done before.

As the first country of proletarian dictatorship, the Soviet Union is a great example in building socialism. It has the richest experience, and the main and basic aspects of this experience have universal significance at the present stage of human history. Lenin himself drafted a scientific program for socialist transformation and socialist construction in the Soviet Union, and this scientific program is also the complete doctrine of Marxism-Leninism on the transition period. Due to differences in historical conditions, social structures, and characteristics of revolutionary development, the specific paths and forms of transition to socialism in various countries must be diverse and cannot be completely the same. However, the Marxist-Leninist doctrine on the transition period is applicable to any country, because this doctrine is also the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism that is applicable everywhere.

The Chinese Communists, represented by Comrade Mao Zedong, precisely based on the Marxist-Leninist doctrine on the transition period, based on the basic experience of socialist construction in the Soviet Union, and proceeding from the principle of the unity of Marxist-Leninist theory and practice, conscientiously studied the actual conditions of the political, economic, cultural, and social aspects of China's transition period, and conscientiously studied the construction experience that our party had accumulated since the time of the Southern Revolutionary Base, thereby formulating the general line and general policies to guide China's socialist transformation and socialist construction. It can also be clearly seen that although China's socialist revolution and socialist construction also have many of their own characteristics, in terms of the basic points, the road that our people are currently experiencing is also the broad road of Marxism-Leninism that the Soviet people have already traveled after the October Revolution.

Since the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, our country has entered a transition period and started a new stage of the socialist revolution, and our people's democratic dictatorship has actually become a proletarian dictatorship. The characteristic of our entire transition period is, as Lenin said about the characteristic of the general transition period from capitalism to socialism, that there is both socialism and capitalism, and there is an inevitable struggle of who will win between socialism and capitalism; and the task of the working class that has gained political rule during the entire transition period is to rely on and use its own political rule to eliminate the capitalist exploitation system, replace the private ownership of the means of production with the public ownership of the means of production, and realize the transformation of the entire society on this basis, so that all members of society become laborers, thereby building a socialist society that eliminates classes and exploitation.

In the first few years of the transition to socialism, we could not but implement land reform to resolve the contradictions between feudalism and democracy, namely between landlords and peasants, in the vast rural areas, and at the same time concentrate our efforts to restore the national economy that had been damaged by the war. In 1952, when the land reform was completed, the period of national economic recovery ended, and preparations were being made to implement the first five-year plan for the development of the national economy, our party put forward the general line for the transition period in our country, stipulating the general task of building our country from a backward agricultural country into an advanced socialist industrialized country with a modern industrial base and a modern agricultural base in about three five-year plan periods. At that time, our party recognized that the transition from capitalism to socialism in our country requires a considerable period of time, because it takes a considerable period of time to overcome the backwardness of our economy and culture, transform agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce into a socialist economy, and create the economic, political, and ideological prerequisites necessary to ensure the complete victory of socialism. This is as Lenin said, in order to achieve the goal of building a socialist society, a relatively long transition period is indispensable. "On the one hand, because reorganizing production is a difficult matter, on the other hand, because it takes time to fundamentally change all sectors of life, and on the third hand, because the huge habitual forces that are accustomed to operating in a petty-bourgeois way and in a bourgeois way can only be overcome after a long and persevering struggle."

Our party also recognized that under the conditions in our country, we can adopt peaceful means to eliminate the capitalist exploitation system, that is, the state power of people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class and the Communist Party can lead from top to bottom and obtain the direct support from bottom to top of the broad masses of the people, especially the basic masses of workers and peasants, to carry out socialist transformation. The most reactionary part of the bourgeoisie in our country – the bureaucratic bourgeoisie – was eliminated by the revolution as early as the democratic revolution period, and the national bourgeoisie in our country established an alliance relationship with the working class during the democratic revolution period. Although they became the direct target of the revolution to be eliminated during the socialist revolution period, under the conditions that the working class holds the state power and is not afraid of the bourgeoisie rebelling, they have no other way out but to accept the policy of striving for, uniting, educating, and transforming put forward by our party. This is as Lenin said, in countries where the bourgeoisie does not dare to resist madly, the working class can achieve the same goal "through other more humane ways" without taking the bloody means that they force us to use. However, this does not mean that there is no class struggle, or that the goal of socialism defeating capitalism can be achieved without going through class struggle. Therefore, our party also recognized that in the socialist revolution period, the main class contradiction is the contradiction between the working class and the bourgeoisie. In our country, this contradiction has an antagonistic side and a non-antagonistic side. The bourgeoisie are exploiters, and they will not automatically give up exploitation and withdraw from the stage of history. In the struggle between the two roads of socialism and capitalism, they will always repeatedly compete with the working class. Therefore, this contradiction has an antagonistic nature. However, under the conditions in China, they are different from the bureaucratic bourgeoisie and the landlord class. In addition to exploiting the working class to obtain profits, they also have a side that supports the Constitution and accepts socialist transformation, which makes it possible to handle the contradiction between them and the working class within the people. Here, the prerequisite is that the bourgeoisie must accept socialist transformation, accept the socialist road, and accept the leadership of the Communist Party; and if they do not accept but resist the socialist road and the leadership of the Communist Party, then they will be outside the people and in a position of contradiction between ourselves and the enemy. Therefore, in the final analysis, the struggle between the working class and the bourgeoisie will not stop until the bourgeois elements and their intellectuals are transformed into socialist laborers, that is, before the economic, political, and ideological prerequisites necessary to create the complete victory of socialism are created, and sometimes it will be sharp. This is also as Lenin said, under the conditions of the proletarian dictatorship, class struggle transitioned to a new and higher stage. The exploiters have been overthrown, but the exploiters still retain some means of production, still have money, still have great social connections, still possess the "art" of managing the country, still have factual inequalities that are beneficial to them (for example, they have a higher level of cultural education than the working class), and still have the support of international capital, while at the same time the peasants and the general petty bourgeoisie are accustomed to accepting bourgeois influence and wavering. In all these aspects, the bourgeoisie still has a great advantage. Under these circumstances, the working class cannot but carry out class struggle to oppose the resistance of the exploiters, overcome the conservatism and wavering nature of the petty bourgeoisie, strengthen the organization and discipline of the proletariat, consolidate the ties between the working masses and the working class and its vanguard, and consolidate the proletarian dictatorship. Only in this way can a completely consolidated socialist society be built and a complete victory of socialism over capitalism be achieved.

We first carried out a socialist revolution in the ownership of the means of production on the economic front, implementing the principles of industrial nationalization and agricultural collectivization in the Marxist-Leninist doctrine on the transition period, in order to realize the transition of our country from private ownership of the means of production to public ownership of the means of production. By 1956, our country had basically realized this transition and basically established a new socialist system. This is an extremely important victory, but a revolution in ownership alone is not enough and cannot guarantee the complete victory of socialism over capitalism.

Now, the main situation in our country is that although we have solved the problem of socialism defeating capitalism on the economic front, we have not yet solved the problem of who will win on the political front and the ideological front, that is, the problem of who will win has not been finally and completely solved. It is precisely for this reason that after the victory of the socialist revolution in the ownership of the means of production on the economic front, a socialist revolution on the political front and the ideological front must follow. The so-called socialist revolution on the political front is to consolidate the leadership of the working class and the Communist Party over all aspects of national life, first of all, to consolidate the leadership of the working class and the Communist Party over bourgeois elements, petty-bourgeois elements, and their intellectuals. The so-called socialist revolution on the ideological front is to help the masses of the people improve their socialist awareness and enthusiasm on a national scale and on an overall scale, mainly to help bourgeois elements, petty-bourgeois elements, and their intellectuals accept socialist transformation and improve their socialist awareness and enthusiasm. The general goal to be achieved by carrying out this revolution is to create a political situation in which there is both centralism and democracy, both discipline and freedom, both unity of will and personal ease and liveliness. Only this kind of political situation can form the unity of the people of the whole country in politics and ideology, which is conducive to socialist transformation and socialist construction, and can build our country's modern industry and modern agriculture relatively quickly.

Our party, in accordance with the principles of planned development of the socialist economy and socialist culture in the Marxist-Leninist doctrine on the transition period, put forward a socialist industrialization line with the development of heavy industry as the focus, with the establishment of modern industry and modern agriculture as the goal, and including a cultural and technological revolution. Now our socialist economic system and political system still lack a sufficient material basis, and therefore are not yet consolidated. Our task is to establish a modern industrial base and a modern agricultural base in our country in the next ten to fifteen years. Under the leadership of our party, the people of the whole country are responding to our party's call to build the country with diligence and thrift, and are working creatively with a hundredfold of enthusiasm to achieve this great task.

In the mid-1930s, nearly twenty years after the October Revolution, the Soviet Union had successfully solved the problem of who would win on the economic, political, and cultural ideological fronts in accordance with Leninist principles, and built the first great socialist country in human history. The example of the Soviet Union encourages our people to continue to move forward.

Our country has a state system of people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance, and it is this state system that is the basic guarantee for us to win the complete victory of socialism. Under this state system of people's democratic dictatorship, we have all the means to implement a strong dictatorship against the enemy and use the method of dictatorship to resolve the contradictions between ourselves and the enemy; and at the same time, we have all the conditions to implement democracy within the people and use democratic methods to resolve the contradictions within the people. Our democracy, as Lenin said, is proletarian democracy, socialist democracy, and the democracy of socialist laborers; it does not belong to a few people but to the vast majority of the entire population, including workers, peasants, and all other working people, as well as all people who support socialism and are patriotic. This kind of democracy is incomparable to bourgeois democracy. The current nationwide rectification movement we are carrying out is a form of socialist democracy. Any democracy is a means, and our socialist democracy is also such a means, which must be used to consolidate the proletarian dictatorship, consolidate the leadership of the working class and the Communist Party, develop the enthusiasm of the masses of the people to build socialism, and develop their enthusiasm to fight against all enemies who oppose and undermine the socialist cause. It is precisely by relying on this socialist democracy that we are carrying out the great cause of socialist revolution and socialist construction. Therefore, our country is consolidated, our people are united, and our socialist cause is also developing rapidly and unshakably, and the ultimate, complete, and thorough victory of socialism in our country is just around the corner.

    十月革命的光芒照耀着中国人民的胜利的道路
    熊复
    作为十月革命的伟大成果，人类历史上第一次出现了无产阶级专政的国家——苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟，这就在人类历史上开辟了由资本主义旧世界进到社会主义新世界的整个时代。
    我国人民从来没有忘记，我们自己的革命和建设的事业是同十月革命不可分离地联系在一起的。在十月革命以前，从1840年的鸦片战争到1919年的五四运动的八十年间，我国人民的革命斗争始终没有能够取得胜利，或者只有暂时的和局部的胜利。只是在十月革命之后，有了在十月革命影响下建立起来的中国共产党，有了中国共产党代表工人阶级来领导中国革命，有了以苏联为首的国际革命力量对于中国革命的各种不同方式的援助，我国人民才在经过长期艰苦斗争之后取得了彻底的全国的胜利。十月革命的伟大胜利在当时就给了灾难深重的中国人民以极大的鼓舞。十月革命所开辟的消灭民族压迫和阶级压迫的光明大道又给中国人民指出了前进的方向。十月革命所创立的第一个社会主义国家——苏联的存在和发展，特别是苏联给予中国人民一贯的同情和支持，更使一向孤立的中国人民在国际上获得最忠实的朋友。十月革命对于中国革命的最深刻最集中最根本的影响，则是正如毛泽东同志所说：“十月革命一声炮响，给我们送来了马克思列宁主义。”中国共产党就是在马克思列宁主义和中国工人阶级革命运动相结合的基础上建立和发展起来的。自从建立之日起，中国共产党就把马克思列宁主义当做自己的思想武器，经过长时期努力把马克思列宁主义的普遍真理和中国革命的具体实践结合起来，这才指导了中国革命和建设事业的胜利。这也正如毛泽东同志所说：“反映了全世界无产阶级实践斗争的马克思列宁主义的普遍真理，在它同中国无产阶级和广大人民群众的革命斗争的具体实践相结合的时候，就成为中国人民百战百胜的武器。”
    十月革命是一个真正的人民大革命。十月革命的道路是一条真正的马克思列宁主义的道路。世界上每个国家和民族的人民都必将在工人阶级领导下，沿着这条基本点上彼此相同而又在表现形式上各有自己的特点的道路走向社会主义和共产主义。我国人民正是在工人阶级领导下，踏上了这条由十月革命的光芒照亮了的道路，而因此才赢得了革命胜利和社会主义的发展。正是因为这样，中国共产党中央委员会向党的第八次全国代表大会的政治报告中说：“尽管我国的革命有自己的许多特点，可是中国共产党人把自己所干的事业看成是伟大的十月革命的继续。”
                      （一）
    我们中国共产党人，对于革命开始是没有经验的。只是经过长时期努力，才学会把马克思列宁主义的普遍真理和中国革命的具体实践结合起来，运用马克思列宁主义来正确地解决中国革命问题。
    十月革命是马克思列宁主义的普遍真理和人民群众的革命实践密切结合的典范。以列宁为首的布尔什维克实行了极其英明的政治和思想的领导，而同时又高度地发挥了俄国无产阶级和其他一切劳动人民的革命积极性，正是这两方面的密切结合，保证了十月革命的胜利。马克思列宁主义的根本特点就是理论和实践的统一，十月革命光辉地检验了和证实了马克思列宁主义的这个特点。
    中国共产党人，以毛泽东同志为代表，正是根据马克思列宁主义的普遍真理，根据十月社会主义革命的基本经验，从马克思列宁主义的理论和实践的统一的原则出发，认真研究了中国社会的客观实际和中国人民的客观需要，认真研究了中国的政治、军事、经济、文化各方面的发展状况，认真研究了中国人民的革命实践的传统和经验，从而制订了指导中国革命达到胜利的基本路线和基本政策。可以清楚地看到，尽管我国革命有自己的许多特点，而就基本点方面来说，我国人民所走过的革命的道路正是十月革命所开辟的马克思列宁主义的康庄大道。
    我们知道，中国原来是一个半殖民地半封建的国家，中国人民的敌人是帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义，中国革命第一个阶段的任务是推翻帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的联合统治。中国人民的敌人曾经是异常强大的，当时，中国人民被敌人剥夺了任何政治自由和一切和平活动的可能，因此，中国人民就不得不接受敌人的连续不断的反人民战争，而必须用自己的持久的依靠农村的人民战争，来同敌人进行长期残酷的斗争。在中国，在过去的资产阶级民主革命阶段，最大的革命民主派是农民，从封建土地制度下解放农民是革命的基本问题之一，但是农民本身不能把自己组织成为独立的有明确的革命纲领的政治力量。而中国民族资产阶级在经济上和政治上也是软弱的，除了有革命性一面之外还有妥协性一面，他们是没有能力领导中国人民战胜帝国主义和国民党反动派的。对于中国革命说来，最根本需要的东西是甚么呢？就是列宁所教导的，无产阶级必须而且能够把农民团结在自己方面而成为资产阶级民主革命的领导者，无产阶级必须而且能够依靠工农联盟而把资产阶级民主革命进行到底。中国共产党人正是遵循了列宁的这个教导，把资产阶级民主革命中的领导权从资产阶级手里夺取过来，紧紧地掌握在工人阶级手里，这才领导中国人民战胜了帝国主义和国民党反动派，并为中国人民打开了通往社会主义的道路。这一切正如毛泽东同志所说：“整个革命历史证明，没有工人阶级的领导，革命就要失败，有了工人阶级的领导，革命就胜利了。在帝国主义时代，任何国家的任何别的阶级，都不能领导任何真正的革命达到胜利。中国的小资产阶级和民族资产阶级曾经多次领导过革命，都失败了，就是明证。”
    打开中国革命的历史可以清楚地看到，只是中国共产党才提出了彻底的反帝反封建的革命纲领，才提出了“工人阶级领导的人民大众的反对帝国主义、反对封建主义和反对官僚资本主义的革命”的总路线和总政策，才提出了“发展进步势力、争取中间势力、孤立顽固势力”的完整的策略，才有把资产阶级民主革命和社会主义革命互相区别而又紧密衔接起来的人民民主主义的伟大思想，才有爱国主义和国际主义一致的鲜明立场。一句话，只有中国共产党才有这种关于中国革命的完整的、科学的、伟大的思想。中国共产党这种政治和思想的领导，使中国工人阶级由自在的阶级变成自为的阶级，把极其广大而又极其散漫的农民团结起来而使他们同工人阶级结成了巩固的联盟，并且争取和团结了民族资产阶级而使他们参加了工人阶级领导的以工农联盟为基础的人民民主统一战线。这也就是说，中国共产党这种政治和思想的领导，团结了一切可能团结的人，最大限度地孤立了敌人而又最大限度地建立了工人阶级同盟军的队伍，把中国人民的组织程度和觉悟程度提到了从来未有的高度，从而把中国人民的自发斗争变成了有领导有组织有科学预见来做指导的自觉的革命斗争。
    中国人民就是这样，在工人阶级（通过共产党）的领导下，从1919年五四爱国运动起到1949年中华人民共和国成立的整个历史时期内，经过了资产阶级民主革命的一切必要阶段而走上了社会主义发展的道路。列宁关于从资产阶级民主革命直接过渡到社会主义革命的方针，指导了俄国1917年的二月革命到十月革命的发展，同样也指导了中国资产阶级民主革命直接转变成为社会主义革命。只是在中国的条件下，经过资产阶级民主革命就解决了革命的基本问题即政权问题，把政权从国民党反动派手里从局部地区到全国范围夺取了过来，建立了工人阶级领导的以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政的国家政权。所以，很自然地，中华人民共和国的成立就成为我国资产阶级民主革命的伟大胜利和社会主义革命的伟大开始的主要标志而记载在我国人民的革命斗争的史页上。
                      （二）
    现在，我国人民正在中国共产党领导下进行我们前人所未曾做过的建设社会主义的伟大事业。
    作为第一个无产阶级专政的国家，苏联在建设社会主义方面是一个伟大的榜样。它拥有最丰富的经验，这些经验的主要的和基本的方面在人类历史的现阶段具有普遍的意义。列宁自己手订了在苏联进行社会主义改造和社会主义建设的科学纲领，这个科学纲领也正是马克思列宁主义关于过渡时期的完整的学说。由于历史条件、社会结构和革命发展特点等等方面的不同，各国向社会主义过渡的具体的道路和形式必然是多种多样的，不可能彼此完全相同。但是，马克思列宁主义关于过渡时期的学说对于任何国家说来都是适用的，因为这个学说也正是马克思列宁主义放之四海而皆准的普遍真理。
    中国共产党人，以毛泽东同志为代表，也正是根据马克思列宁主义关于过渡时期的学说，根据苏联社会主义建设的基本经验，从马克思列宁主义的理论和实践的统一的原则出发，认真研究了中国过渡时期政治、经济、文化、社会各方面的实际状况，认真研究了我们党自南方革命根据地时候起就积累起来的建设经验，从而制订了指导我国社会主义改造和社会主义建设的总路线和总政策。也可以清楚地看到，尽管中国社会主义革命和社会主义建设也有自己的许多特点，而就基本点方面来说，我国人民所正在经历的道路，也正是十月革命后苏联人民已经走过的马克思列宁主义的康庄大道。
    自1949年中华人民共和国成立之日起，我们国家就进入了过渡时期，开始了社会主义革命的新阶段，而我国人民民主专政也就在实际上变成了无产阶级专政。我国整个过渡时期的特点，也正如列宁就一般由资本主义到社会主义的过渡时期的特点所说的一样，既有社会主义，又有资本主义，在社会主义和资本主义之间不可避免地要发生谁战胜谁的斗争；而取得政治统治权的工人阶级在整个过渡时期的任务，就是依靠和利用自己的政治统治来消灭资本主义剥削制度，用生产资料的公有制来代替生产资料的私有制，在这个基础上实现对于全社会的改造，使全体社会成员都成为劳动者，由此建成消灭阶级和剥削的社会主义社会。
    在向社会主义过渡的最初几年，我们还不能不实行土地改革来解决广大农村中封建主义和民主主义即地主和农民之间的矛盾，同时集中力量来恢复受到战争破坏的国民经济。到了1952年土地改革完成、国民经济恢复时期结束、准备实行第一个发展国民经济的五年计划的时候，我们党就提出了我国过渡时期总路线，规定了要在大约三个五年计划时期把我国由一个落后的农业国建设成为一个先进的拥有现代化工业基础和现代化农业基础的社会主义工业化国家的总任务。当时我们党就认定了，我国由资本主义到社会主义的过渡需要有一个相当长的时间，这是因为要有一个相当长时间才能够克服我国经济和文化的落后，改造农业、手工业和资本主义工商业为社会主义经济，造成为保证社会主义完全胜利所需要的经济上、政治上和思想上的前提。这就正如列宁所说的，为要达到建成社会主义社会的目的，没有一个较为长久的过渡时期是不可能的。“这一方面因为改组生产是一件困难的事情，另一方面因为根本改变生活一切部门是需要时间的，第三方面因为惯于按照小资产阶级方式经营、按照资产阶级方式经营的那种巨大习惯势力，是只有经过长期坚忍斗争，才能克服的。”
    我们党还认定了，在我国的条件下，我们可以采取和平方式来消灭资本主义剥削制度，就是说可以由工人阶级和共产党领导下的人民民主专政的国家政权从上而下地领导并取得广大人民群众首先是工人和农民基本群众从下而上的直接支持来进行社会主义改造。我国资产阶级中的最反动部分——官僚资产阶级早在民主革命时期就被革命消灭了，而我国民族资产阶级则在民主革命时期就同工人阶级建立了联盟关系，他们到了社会主义革命时期虽然变成了革命所要直接消灭的对象，但是在工人阶级掌握着国家政权、不怕资产阶级造反的条件下，他们除了被迫接受我们党提出的争取、团结、教育、改造的政策之外没有别的出路。这就正如列宁所说的，在资产阶级不敢疯狂反抗的国家里，工人阶级可以不采取他们逼迫我们使用的流血手段，而有可能“通过其他更人道的方式来达到同样的目的”。但是，这并不是说就没有阶级斗争，或者不通过阶级斗争就可以达到社会主义战胜资本主义的目的。所以，我们党也认定了，在社会主义革命时期，主要的阶级矛盾就是工人阶级和资产阶级之间的矛盾。在我国，这种矛盾有对抗性一面，也有非对抗性一面。资产阶级是剥削者，他们不会自动放弃剥削而退出历史舞台，他们在社会主义和资本主义两条道路谁胜谁负的斗争中也总是要同工人阶级反复较量力量的，所以这种矛盾具有对抗的性质。但是，在中国的条件下，他们又同官僚资产阶级和地主阶级不同，除了有剥削工人阶级取得利润一面之外还有拥护宪法、接受社会主义改造一面，这就有可能把他们同工人阶级之间的矛盾放在人民内部来处理。在这里，先决的条件是资产阶级必须接受社会主义改造，接受社会主义道路和共产党的领导；而如果他们不接受而是反抗社会主义道路和共产党的领导，那末他们就是自外于人民而处于敌我矛盾的地位。所以，归根结蒂，不到把资产阶级分子和他们的知识分子改造成为社会主义劳动者以前，也就是在造成社会主义完全胜利所需要的经济上、政治上和思想上的前提以前，工人阶级和资产阶级之间的斗争是不会停止的，有时还会是尖锐的。这也正如列宁所说，在无产阶级专政条件下，阶级斗争过渡到了新的更高的阶段。剥削者被推翻了，但是剥削者还保有某些生产资料，还有金钱，还有极大的社会联系，还拥有管理国家的“艺术”，还有对他们有利的事实上的不平等（例如他们有比工人阶级较高的文化教育程度），还有国际资本的支持，而同时农民和一般小资产阶级又习惯于接受资产阶级影响而发生动摇，在这一切方面，资产阶级还获得极大的优势。在这种情况下，工人阶级就不能不进行阶级斗争来反对剥削者的反抗，克服小资产阶级的守旧习气和动摇天性，增强无产阶级的组织性和纪律性，巩固劳动群众同工人阶级及其先锋队的联系，巩固无产阶级专政。只有这样，才能建成完全巩固的社会主义社会，取得社会主义对于资本主义的完全胜利。
    我们首先在经济战线上进行了生产资料所有制方面的社会主义革命，实行了马克思列宁主义过渡时期学说中关于工业国有化和农业集体化的原则，来实现我们国家从生产资料私有制到生产资料公有制的过渡。到1956年，我们国家在基本上实现了这个过渡，基本上建立了社会主义新制度。这是一个极其重大的胜利，但是单有所有制方面的革命还是不够的，还不能保证社会主义对资本主义的彻底胜利。
    现在，我们国家的主要状况是，我们虽然已经在经济战线上解决了社会主义战胜资本主义的问题，但是还没有在政治战线上和思想战线上解决这个谁胜谁负的问题，也就是说，这个谁胜谁负的问题还没有最后的彻底的解决。正是因为这样，在经济战线上生产资料所有制方面的社会主义革命取得胜利之后，不能不随之发生政治战线上和思想战线上的社会主义革命。所谓政治战线上的社会主义革命，就是巩固工人阶级和共产党对于国家生活一切方面的领导，首先就是巩固工人阶级和共产党对于资产阶级分子、小资产阶级分子和他们的知识分子的领导。所谓思想战线上的社会主义革命，就是在全国范围内和全体规模上帮助人民群众提高社会主义的觉悟性和积极性，主要地就是帮助资产阶级分子、小资产阶级分子和他们的知识分子接受社会主义改造而提高社会主义的觉悟性和积极性。进行这个革命所要达到的总目标是要造成这样一种政治局面：又有集中又有民主，又有纪律又有自由，又有统一意志又有个人的心情舒畅和生动活泼。只有这种政治局面，才能形成全国人民在政治上和思想上的一致性，才有利于社会主义改造和社会主义建设，才能比较快地建成我国的现代化工业和现代化农业。
    我们党按照马克思列宁主义过渡时期学说中关于有计划地发展社会主义经济和社会主义文化的原则，提出了以发展重工业为重心的、以建立现代化工业和现代化农业为目标的、包括文化技术革命在内的社会主义工业化路线。现在我们的社会主义的经济制度和政治制度还缺乏充分的物质基础，因而还是不巩固的。我们的任务就是要在今后十年到十五年的时间内在我国建立一个现代化的工业基础和现代化的农业基础。全国人民正在我们党的领导下，响应着我们党的勤俭建国的号召，百倍奋发地进行着创造性的劳动，为着实现这个伟大任务而努力。
    苏联在三十年代中叶，离开十月革命将近二十年的时候，已经按照列宁主义原则而在经济、政治和文化思想各个战线上胜利地解决了谁战胜谁的问题，建成了人类历史上第一个伟大的社会主义国家。苏联的先例，鼓舞着我国人民继续前进。
    我们国家有一个工人阶级领导的以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政的国家制度，正是这个国家制度是我们争取社会主义的彻底胜利的基本保证。在这个人民民主专政的国家制度下，我们有一切手段来对敌人实行强有力的专政，用专政的方法来解决敌我之间的矛盾；而同时也有一切条件来对人民内部实行民主，用民主的方法来解决人民内部的矛盾。我们的民主，正如列宁所说，是无产阶级民主，社会主义民主，社会主义劳动者的民主；它不属于少数人而是属于全人口中占绝大多数的工人、农民和其他一切劳动人民以及一切拥护社会主义和爱国的人民。这种民主，是资产阶级民主所不能比拟的。目前我们正在进行着的全民整风运动正是社会主义民主的一种形式。任何民主都是一种手段，我们的社会主义民主也是这样一种手段，它必须用来巩固无产阶级专政，巩固工人阶级和共产党的领导，发展人民群众建设社会主义的积极性，发展他们同一切反对和破坏社会主义事业的敌人进行斗争的积极性。我们正是依靠这种社会主义民主来进行社会主义革命和社会主义建设的伟大事业。因此，我们国家是巩固的，我国人民是团结的，我们的社会主义事业也是正在突飞猛进地发展而不可动摇的，社会主义在我国的最终的完全的彻底的胜利也就是指日可待的了。　（未完）
