No U.S. Interference in Korean Internal Affairs
By Our Staff Commentator

On November 18th, the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly, under the manipulation of the United States, passed a so-called resolution on the Korean question. This resolution was proposed by the United States and eleven other countries, and it is almost entirely a replica of the proposal made solely by the United States at the Eleventh United Nations General Assembly. The resolution reiterates some "basic principles" related to the Korean question "passed" by the United Nations General Assembly in the past under U.S. manipulation, attempting to achieve the goal of "unifying" Korea under "a representative government" through so-called "free elections" under "United Nations supervision." In plain language, this is nothing more than a repetition of the old tune of the United States trying to impose its will on the other side. It attempts to grossly interfere in the internal affairs of Korea under the guise of the United Nations, and to extend the dark rule of the U.S. puppet Syngman Rhee in South Korea to the entire Korean peninsula. This absurd "resolution" will not only not help solve the Korean problem, but will only hinder the Korean people from solving the issue of national reunification themselves.

The Korean issue can only be resolved reasonably through fair discussions with the participation of all relevant parties. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea is a relevant party and should naturally participate in the UN General Assembly's discussion on the Korean issue. However, for several years, due to U.S. obstruction, representatives of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea have been unreasonably excluded from the meeting. At this session of the UN General Assembly Political Committee, the proposal made by India, supported by the Soviet Union and many other countries, to invite representatives of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to participate in the discussion was originally very fair, but it was once again unreasonably rejected by the voting machine manipulated by the United States. However, the United States and its followers stubbornly dragged South Korean representatives into the meeting. This approach by the United States is clearly not intended to genuinely resolve the Korean issue. On the contrary, the United States uses the United Nations platform every year to distort the truth on the Korean issue, merely to continue obstructing the peaceful reunification of Korea, in order to permanently occupy southern Korea and maintain an aggressive base and a source of tension there.

The Chinese people resolutely oppose the United States' use of the United Nations to interfere in Korean affairs. We have always supported the just demands of the Korean people: the Korean issue should be resolved by the Korean people themselves. The Chinese and Korean governments have suggested to the United States that a conference of relevant countries be convened to discuss the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea and the peaceful reunification of Korea. However, the U.S. government rejected this proposal and, in June of this year, brazenly tore up paragraph 13D of the Armistice Agreement by transporting new weapons into South Korea, attempting to turn South Korea into a U.S. military base of aggression forever. In October of this year, suggestions made by the Korean and Chinese sides at the Military Armistice Commission meeting to facilitate trade between North and South Korea were also unreasonably rejected by the United States. The United States is also attempting to forcibly drag South Korea into the United Nations, in order to create a situation of permanent division between North and South Korea. All of this shows that the United States is deliberately obstructing and undermining the peaceful reunification of Korea in order to maintain the tense situation in the Far East. These obvious facts cannot be concealed by the U.S. representative's eloquent rhetoric and distortion of the truth. The illegal resolution passed by the United Nations hijacked by the United States once again exposes its conspiracy to place the entire Korean peninsula under its colonial rule. This should be condemned by fair-minded public opinion around the world.

    朝鲜内政不容美国干涉
    本报评论员
    11月18日，联合国大会政治委员会在美国的操纵之下，通过了一项所谓关于朝鲜问题的决议。这项决议案是由美国等十一个国家提出的，它同美国在第十一届联合国大会上单独提出的提案几乎完全是依样葫芦。决议重申了美国过去操纵联合国大会所“通过”的有关朝鲜问题的一些“基本原则”，企图通过“联合国监督下”的所谓“自由选举”，来达到在“代议制政府领导下”实现“统一”朝鲜的目的。用通俗的语言来说，这不过是美国想把一方意志强加于另一方的老调重弹，它企图假借联合国名义粗暴地干涉朝鲜的内政，把美国傀儡李承晚在南朝鲜的黑暗统治扩大到全朝鲜。这种荒谬的“决议”，不但无助于朝鲜问题的解决，而且只能起阻挠朝鲜人民自己解决祖国统一问题的作用。
    朝鲜问题只有在有关各方面共同参加之下，进行公正的讨论，才能求得合理的解决。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国是有关的一方，当然应该参加联合国大会关于朝鲜问题的讨论。但是几年来，由于美国的阻挠，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的代表一直被无理地排斥在会议之外。在这一届联大政治委员会上，印度提出的、得到苏联等许多国家支持的邀请朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表参加讨论的建议，本来是十分公正的，但是再一次受到美国所操纵的表决机器的无理否决。而美国和它的追随者却硬把南朝鲜代表拉到会议上来。美国这种做法显然不是要真正解决朝鲜问题。正相反，美国每年利用联合国讲坛在朝鲜问题上颠倒黑白地叫嚣一通，只不过是要继续阻挠朝鲜的和平统一，以便永久占领南部朝鲜，在那里保持一个侵略基地和紧张局势的根源。
    中国人民坚决反对美国利用联合国干涉朝鲜事务。我们一向支持朝鲜人民的正义主张：朝鲜问题应该由朝鲜人民自己来解决。中、朝两国政府曾经向美国方面建议，召开有关国家会议来协商从朝鲜撤出一切外国军队以及和平统一朝鲜等问题。但是美国政府却拒绝了这个建议，并且在今年6月悍然撕毁了停战协定第十三款卯项，把新武器运进南朝鲜，企图把南朝鲜永远变成美国的军事侵略基地。今年10月，朝、中方面在军事停战委员会会议上提出有助于南北朝鲜通商的建议，也遭到了美方的无理拒绝。美国还企图把南朝鲜硬拉入联合国，以造成南北朝鲜永远分裂的局面。所有这些都说明美国处心积虑地在阻挠和破坏朝鲜的和平统一，以保持远东地区的紧张形势。这种明显的事实，决不是美国代表鼓其如簧之舌，颠倒黑白所能掩盖得了的。美国劫持联合国所通过的非法决议，再一次暴露了它想把整个朝鲜置于它的殖民统治之下的阴谋。这应当受到全世界公正舆论的谴责。
