Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 8th: A grand and solemn rally was held by people from all walks of life in Moscow at 12:15 noon on the 8th at the Lenin Stadium Sports Palace to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution.

The Sports Palace was decorated solemnly and simply. The Soviet flag was erected on the top of the hall, and the hall was hung with the Soviet emblem and the emblems and flags of the fifteen republics. A huge banner composed of torches was hung on the rostrum: "Long Live the 40th Anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution!" The words "1917" and "1957" were written on both sides of the slogan.

A huge portrait of Lenin hung in the center of the rostrum, flanked by large red flags. Flowers were placed on the stage.

Soviet Communist Party and government leaders attended the celebration.

The celebration was attended by delegations from various socialist countries, delegations from communist and workers' parties of various countries, and other foreign delegations.

The Chinese delegation headed by Comrade Mao Zedong attended the meeting.

The Chinese Military Goodwill Delegation to the Soviet Union and the Labor People's Delegation also attended the meeting.

The celebration was also attended by delegations from other socialist countries, delegations from communist and workers' parties of various countries, and other foreign delegations. The Chinese Labor People's Delegation also attended the meeting.

Also present at the celebration were many participants of the October Revolution, heads of various ministries of the Soviet government, heads of social organizations, people from the fields of science, culture, education, and art, representatives of workers, collective farmers, youth, and women, as well as diplomatic envoys from various countries to the Soviet Union and Soviet and foreign journalists.

A total of more than 10,000 people attended the meeting.

Furtseva, member of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and First Secretary of the Moscow City Committee, served as the chairman of the meeting. On behalf of all Muscovites, she extended a warm welcome to the representatives of various countries and, through them, expressed the best wishes to the people of various countries. She said that the October Revolution Day is not only our festival, but also the festival of the working class all over the world. In the various stages since the establishment of the Soviet state, the working people of all countries have given moral support to the Soviet people. When foreign interventionists attacked the Soviet state, workers from all countries shouted the slogan "Get out of Russia!" to the interventionists. We are grateful for this support. She emphasized that the power generated by the mutual support of the working people is enough to crush any conspiracy of the imperialists. The unshakable principle of proletarian internationalism has been and will be the foundation of our activities.

After Furtseva's speech, a total of thirty-one representatives from various countries spoke. As they walked to the podium, the audience stood up and applauded. Their speeches were warmly welcomed.

The first speaker was Maurice Thorez, Secretary-General of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party. Thorez said that the October Socialist Revolution gloriously recovered the shame of the failure of the Paris Commune. Socialism has become a world system, which is the basic feature of our era. October 1917 created the conditions for the rapid achievement of the scientific and technological level that the Soviet Union has now reached.

Thorez pointed out that the unbreakable unity of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the rock-solid unity of the Communist Party ranks, and the firm struggle against revisionism and opportunism are the guarantees of all the achievements of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

Next, Palmiro Togliatti, Secretary-General of the Italian Communist Party, spoke. He said that the great victory won by the various nationalities of Russia in October 1917 changed the course of world history. Now, the Soviet Union has a strong force that can powerfully influence the solution of the most complex problems facing mankind. The Soviet Union has become a fortress of civilization and progress.

Togliatti emphasized that the existence of the Soviet Union has a decisive influence on the workers' movements in various countries, including Italy. He said that it is now clear that the working class can win and socialism can triumph throughout the world.

Referring to the divisive activities of social democrats and other enemies of the workers' movement, Togliatti emphasized that the proletarian unity of the Italian working people and the Soviet working people will always be the main strength and life of all loyal people in Italy. He said that we are committed to opening up our own path to socialism, but those who expect us to break away from the principles of proletarian internationalism and abandon solidarity with the Soviet state are gravely mistaken.

Togliatti continued: We are moving forward with hope and unwavering determination for our victory. Capitalism is no longer a dominant force.

Song Qingling (Soong Ching Ling), Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of China, and Chairman of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, spoke. She extended the warmest congratulations to the participants of the meeting, to the great Soviet people and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on behalf of the Chinese delegation and the Chinese people. She said that the profound friendship between China and the Soviet Union is a symbol and an important pillar of the great unity of the camp of peace, democracy and socialism. China will always stand with their great friend, the Soviet Union.

Louis Saillant, Vice President of the World Federation of Trade Unions, extended warm congratulations to the attendees on behalf of 92 million members of the World Federation of Trade Unions.

Harry Pollitt, Chairman of the Executive Committee of the British Communist Party, said that the British working people firmly advocate friendship with the Soviet Union because they know that if the people of these two countries can unite closely, no country in the world would dare to launch a third world war. He continued, "I have visited your country many times, and each time I am amazed by the unimaginable and tremendous achievements of your people. Currently, the Soviet Union has launched two artificial satellites, which are orbiting the earth. The Soviet Union is indeed a beacon for peace-loving people, pointing them to the path to lasting peace. For British workers living in periodic crises, the Soviet Union is a source of example and hope compared to workers in other countries."

The speech by Ajoy Ghosh, General Secretary of the Communist Party of India, was warmly welcomed. He said that the October Revolution destroyed the foundations of imperialism and colonialism and strengthened the national liberation movements of the oppressed countries in many ways. Ghosh emphasized that now one-third of mankind has embarked on the path of Marxism-Leninism—the only correct path for mankind. There is no doubt that socialism will also triumph in other countries in the near future. He went on to say that the struggle of the Communist Party of India and other progressive forces has achieved great victories.

Next, Ignar, Chairman of the Polish United Peasant Party, spoke to the attendees. He extended warm congratulations to the Soviet people.

When Dolores Ibárruri, Secretary-General of the Spanish Communist Party, appeared on the podium, enthusiastic and friendly applause rang out in the hall.

She said that the October Revolution of 1917 meant a huge leap in human development. The victory of October gave us experience and filled us with confidence in the victory of our just cause. Now General Franco's reactionary autocracy has been greatly weakened, and the democratic forces, the forces of the Spanish people, are preparing for a new struggle for democratic freedom.

Hermann Matern, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the German Communist Party, conveyed the fraternal congratulations and deep sympathy of the West German communists to the Muscovites and through them to the Soviet people in his speech.

Sudisman, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Indonesia, said: "The Soviet Union and the Republic of Indonesia are fighting side by side for world peace." He emphasized that the Communist Party and the progressive forces of the Indonesian people have achieved victory thanks to the Marxist-Leninism which inspires the world workers' movement. Amidst the stormy applause of the attendees, Sudisman said: "The era of lasting peace will surely come."

Johann Koplenig, Chairman of the Austrian Communist Party, and Alois Plojhar, Chairman of the Czechoslovak People's Party, spoke and congratulated the attendees on the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution on behalf of the Austrian and Czechoslovak people respectively.

Jean-Marie Dhellemmes, Vice Chairman of the World Peace Council, said that we hope that all peace-loving forces in the world will unite. He continued, "Three days after the Supreme Soviet commemorative meeting, we are once again convinced in the same hall that the achievements of socialist construction can only be achieved in a peaceful environment. The two small artificial moons that are currently orbiting the earth are moons of peace. We hope they will become new symbols of peace."

The following then spoke at the meeting: Traykov, Secretary of the Bulgarian Agrarian National Union; Ville Pessi, Secretary-General of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Finland; and Victorio Codovilla, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Argentina.

Vittorio Vecchietti, Member of the Leadership and Secretariat of the Italian Socialist Party, emphasized in his speech that the peace goals for which the Soviet Union is fighting are also the goals for which the Italian working people are fighting.

Aksel Larsen, Chairman of the Danish Communist Party; Lothar Bolz, Chairman of the Christian Democratic Union of Germany; Hilding Hagberg, Secretary of the Swedish Communist Party; and Reidar Lovlien, Chairman of the Norwegian Communist Party, then spoke.

The speech of Khaled Bakdash, Member of the Leadership of the Central Committee of the Syrian and Lebanese Communist Party, was warmly welcomed. He said that the Soviet Union is the greatest friend of the Arab countries. "The love, respect and praise of your country by the Arabs are not accidental, they have deep roots and are inseparable from their struggle for independence." The Soviet Union respects the high culture of the Arabs and supports their just desire for freedom.

He continued that the threat of aggression hangs over Syria, but our people are full of firm confidence in victory and are fighting against this danger, as Khrushchev and Mao Zedong said, because they have the support of all peace-loving people in the world. All patriots in our country are convinced that friendship with the Soviet Union is a fundamental element of their lives and a guarantee of peace in the Near East and the world.

Eugénie Cotton, President of the Women's International Democratic Federation, gave a touching speech. She said that women all over the world are grateful to the Soviet people for their great work in strengthening international peace.

Also speaking at the meeting were: Yoshio Shiga, Member of the Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party; Ernest Burnelle, National Secretary of the Belgian Communist Party; Paul de Groot, Secretary-General of the Dutch Communist Party; Tim Buck, Secretary-General of the Labor-Progressive Party of Canada; Nguyen Xien, Secretary-General of the Vietnam Socialist Party; Shmuel Mikunis, Secretary-General of the Communist Party of Israel; Laurence Sharkey, Secretary-General of the Communist Party of Australia; and Enrico Bajini, Chairman of the World Federation of Democratic Youth.

Finally, Kuzmin, a worker from the Moscow Red Proletarian Factory, expressed his heartfelt gratitude to the participants of the meeting and to the guests from various countries on behalf of the people from all walks of life in Moscow.

The celebration ended at 4:30 pm (Moscow time), at which time the audience stood up and sang the Internationale.

    莫斯科举行庆祝十月革命节群众大会
    来自各国的三十一位代表在会上论述十月革命的伟大意义
    据新华社莫斯科8日电　莫斯科各界劳动人民8日中午十二时十五分在列宁运动场体育宫举行盛大、隆重的庆祝大会，庆祝伟大的十月社会主义革命四十周年。
    体育宫布置得庄严朴素，大厅顶上竖着苏联国旗，大厅中挂有苏联国徽以及十五个加盟共和国的国徽和国旗。主席台上悬着用灯炬组成的巨幅标语：“伟大的十月社会主义革命四十周年万岁！”标语两旁写有“1917”“1957”字样。
    主席台正中挂着列宁的巨幅画像，两旁是大面红旗。台上摆设着鲜花。
    苏联共产党和政府领导人出席了庆祝大会。
    出席大会的有各社会主义国家代表团、各国共产党和工人党代表团、其他的外国代表团。
    以毛泽东同志为首的中国代表团出席了大会。
    中国军事友好访苏代表团和劳动人民代表团也参加了大会。
    出席大会的还有其他社会主义国家的代表团、各国共产党和工人党代表团、其他的外国代表团。中国劳动人民代表团也参加了大会。
    出席庆祝大会的还有许多十月革命的参加者，苏联政府各部首长，社会团体负责人，科学、文化、教育、艺术界人士，工人、集体农民、青年、妇女的代表们，以及各国驻苏联外交使节和苏联及外国的新闻记者。
    参加大会的总共有一万多人。
    苏联共产党中央委员会主席团委员、莫斯科市委员会第一书记福尔采娃担任大会主席。她以全体莫斯科人的名义向各国代表们表示热烈欢迎，并且通过他们向各国人民表示最好的愿望。她说，十月革命节不仅是我们的节日，而且是全世界工人阶级的节日。在苏维埃国家建立以来的各个阶段中，各国劳动人民一直给予苏联人民以道义上的支持。当外国干涉者进攻苏维埃国家的时候，各国工人向干涉者喊出了“从俄国滚出去”的口号。我们感谢这种支持。她着重指出，劳动人民相互支持所产生的力量足以粉碎帝国主义者的任何阴谋。不可动摇的无产阶级国际主义原则在过去和将来都是我们活动基础的基础。
    在福尔采娃致词后，总共有来自各国的三十一位代表讲了话。当他们走向讲台时，全场一一起立鼓掌。他们的讲话受到了热烈的欢迎。
    首先讲话的是法国共产党中央委员会总书记多列士。多列士说，十月社会主义革命光辉地挽回了巴黎公社失败的耻辱。社会主义变成为一个世界体系，这是我们时代的基本特征。1917年10月为迅速达到苏联现在所达到的高度的科学和技术水平创造了条件。
    多列士指出，苏联共产党牢不可破的团结，共产党队伍的坚如磐石的团结，以及对修正主义和机会主义的坚决斗争，是苏联共产党一切成就的保证。
    接着，意大利共产党总书记陶里亚蒂讲话。他说，俄国各族人民在1917年十月所取得的伟大胜利改变了世界历史的进程。现在，苏联拥有强大的力量，它能够有力地影响人类所面临的各种最复杂问题的解决。苏联已经成为文明和进步的堡垒。
    陶里亚蒂强调指出，苏联的存在对各国工人运动有着决定性的影响，其中包括意大利。他说，现在人们都清楚，工人阶级能够获胜，社会主义能够在全世界胜利。
    陶里亚蒂在谈到社会民主党人和工人运动的其他敌人的分裂活动时强调指出，意大利劳动人民和苏联劳动人民的无产阶级团结永远是意大利一切忠诚的人的主要力量和生命。他说，我们致力于开辟一条我们自己的走向社会主义的道路，但是，那些指望我们脱离无产阶级国际主义原则、放弃同苏维埃国家的团结的人，是大错特错了。
    陶里亚蒂接着说：我们满怀着希望和对我们的胜利的不可动摇的决心向前迈进。资本主义再不是统治力量了。
    中国全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长、中苏友好协会总会会长宋庆龄讲话。她代表中国代表团和中国人民向会议的参加者、向伟大的苏联人民和苏联共产党表示最热烈的祝贺。她说，中国和苏联的深厚友谊是和平、民主、社会主义阵营的伟大团结的标志和一个重要的支柱。中国将永远同他们的伟大朋友苏联站在一起。
    世界工会联合会副主席弗拉商代表世界工联九千二百万会员向到会者致以热烈的祝贺。
    英国共产党执行委员会主席波立特说，英国劳动人民坚决主张同苏联友好，因为他们知道，如果这两个国家的人民能够紧密团结，世界上就没有任何国家敢于发动第三次世界大战。他接着说，我到贵国来过很多次，每一次你们人民的那种难以想像的巨大成就都使我感到惊讶。目前苏联发出两颗人造卫星，它们正在围绕地球回转。苏联的确是爱好和平人民的灯塔，给他们指出了走向持久和平的道路。对于生活在周期性危机情况下的英国工人来说，同其他国家工人相比，苏联更是榜样和希望的源泉。
    印度共产党总书记高士的讲话受到了热烈的欢迎。他说，十月革命摧毁了帝国主义和殖民主义的基础，并且在许多方面加强了被压迫国家人民的民族解放运动。高士强调说，现在三分之一的人类走上了马克思列宁主义的道路——人类唯一正确的道路。毫无疑问，在不久的将来社会主义还会在其他国家取得胜利。他接着说，印度共产党和其他进步力量的斗争得到了极大的胜利。
    接着，波兰统一农民党主席伊格纳尔向到会者讲话。他向苏联人民表示热烈的祝贺。
    当西班牙共产党总书记伊巴露丽出现在讲台上时，大厅内响起了热烈的、友谊的掌声。
  她说，1917年的十月革命意味着人类发展的巨大飞跃。十月的胜利给了我们经验，使我们对自己的正义事业的胜利充满信心。现在佛朗哥将军的反动专制大大地削弱了，而民主力量，西班牙人民的力量正准备进行争取民主自由的新的斗争。
    德国共产党中央委员会第一书记雷曼在讲话中向莫斯科人并通过他们向苏联人民转达西德共产党员的兄弟祝贺和深切同情。
    印度尼西亚共产党中央政治局委员苏蒂斯曼讲话说：“苏联和印度尼西亚共和国为争取世界和平而并肩作战”。他着重指出，由于有鼓舞全世界工人运动的马克思列宁主义，共产党和印度尼西亚人民的进步力量获得了胜利。苏蒂斯曼在与会者的暴风雨般的掌声中说：“持久和平的时代必将来临”。
    奥地利共产党主席柯普勒尼希和捷克斯洛伐克人民党主席普洛伊哈讲话，他们分别代表奥地利和捷克斯洛伐克人民向到会者祝贺十月革命四十周年。
    世界和平理事会副主席德拉维热里说，我们希望世界一切热爱和平的力量团结起来。他接着说，在最高苏维埃纪念会开会后的第三天，在同一个大厅中我们又一次确信，只有在和平的情况下才能够取得社会主义建设的成就。现在正在围绕地球旋转的两颗小小的人造月亮，是和平的月亮。我们希望它们成为新的和平象征。
    接着在会上讲话的是：保加利亚农民联盟书记特莱科夫，芬兰共产党中央委员会总书记维勒·培西、阿根廷共产党中央委员会书记柯都维亚。
    意大利社会党领导机构委员和书记处书记维基耶蒂在讲话中强调指出，苏联所奋斗争取的和平目的，也正是意大利劳动人民为之奋斗的目的。
    丹麦共产党主席拉森，民主德国基督教民主联盟主席努舍克，瑞典共产党书记哈格堡，挪威共产党主席洛夫林，接着讲话。
    叙利亚和黎巴嫩共产党中央领导机构委员海劳的讲话受到了热烈的欢迎。他说，苏联是阿拉伯国家最大的朋友。阿拉伯人对“贵国的爱戴、尊敬和赞扬不是偶然的，这是有深厚根源的，同他们争取独立的斗争是分不开的”。苏联尊重阿拉伯的高度文化，支持他们争取自由的正义愿望。
    他继续说，侵略的威胁降临在叙利亚的头上，但是，我国人民充满对胜利的坚定信心，为反对这种危险而斗争，正如赫鲁晓夫和毛泽东所说的，因为他们得到了世界一切爱好和平人民的支持。我国的所有爱国者都确信，同苏联的友谊是他们生活的基本要素，是近东和全世界和平的保证。
    国际民主妇女联合会主席戈登夫人作了感动人的讲话。她说，全世界妇女都感激苏联人民为加强国际和平所作的巨大工作。
    在大会上讲话的还有：日本共产党中央委员会常任干部会委员志贺义雄，比利时共产党全国书记伯内尔，荷兰共产党总书记格鲁特，加拿大劳工进步党总书记布克，越南社会党总书记阮阐，以色列共产党总书记米库尼斯，澳大利亚共产党总书记夏基，世界民主青年联盟主席柏尼尼。
    最后，莫斯科红色无产者工厂工人库兹明代表莫斯科各界劳动人民向大会参加者、向来自各国的客人们表示衷心的感谢。
    庆祝大会在下午四时半（莫斯科时间）宣告结束，这时全场起立，高唱国际歌。
