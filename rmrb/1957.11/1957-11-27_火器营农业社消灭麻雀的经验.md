The main experiences of the Huoqiying (Fire Brigade) Agricultural Cooperative in Dongran Village Township, Haidian District, Beijing in eliminating sparrows: On the one hand, it is necessary to mobilize all the masses to ensure that everyone takes action; on the other hand, it is necessary to use various methods and tools to cast a dragnet over the sparrows in order to achieve significant results.

In terms of mobilizing the masses: First, it is necessary to conduct in-depth propaganda and education among the masses so that everyone recognizes the significance of eliminating sparrows, so that the masses can act consciously. Second, it is necessary to establish organizations and unify leadership. Third, it is necessary to fully utilize the strength of young people and give full play to the role of professional bird catchers.

In terms of methods of catching sparrows: It is imperative to master the four methods of "search, capture, dig out, and block" and the principles of "steady, accurate, and ruthless." The main catching methods are as follows:

I. Large Net Trap: Use two nets, each about 36 feet long and 12 feet wide, connect one end of the two nets together, nail the bottom of the nets to the ground, forming a "?" shape when viewed from above. Thread a rope along the upper edge of the net, leading to a hidden place, where a person is stationed. Place two sparrows inside the net as bait. When many sparrows enter the net, pull the rope forcefully, the upper edges of the net will come together, and the net will fall to the ground, trapping all the sparrows inside. This method can catch hundreds of sparrows at a time. Recently, cooperative member Tang Qinglu and student Liu Zhenjiang used this method to trap 259 sparrows in one net.

II. Flashlight Illumination and Hand Capture: Generally, sparrows roost under the eaves of houses. When sparrows see the strong light emitted by a flashlight in the darkness, they cannot open their eyes and cannot fly. At this time, it is very easy to catch them by hand. When using this method to catch birds, it is best to have two or three people working together. One person first shines the flashlight on the sparrow, one person holds the ladder, and the other person climbs up to catch it. The movements must be quick and light, and do not let the captured sparrow make any noise, so as not to alarm other sparrows. For example, student Fu Shushen used this method to catch 36 sparrows in one night.

III. Glue Traps: Take four liang of Perilla seed oil, place it in a small earthenware pot and simmer over a low heat for about 20 minutes, pour out a portion, called "thin glue," for adjusting the glue. Continue to simmer the remainder for about 40 minutes, until golden yellow bubbles appear, then it becomes thick glue, also called old glue. Stir with a wooden board before using. When using, take several two-foot-long sticks of thorny branches, apply the glue to these sticks, called "glue sticks," and insert the "glue sticks" in trees, haystacks, eaves, etc., according to the specific situation. According to the sparrows' habit of liking to fly and land into the wind, the "glue sticks" should be tied to various places facing the wind. Sparrows that land on the "glue sticks" will be stuck. After a sparrow is stuck, the feathers on the "glue stick" must be cleaned, otherwise other sparrows will not continue to land on it. The place where the "glue sticks" are tied must be changed frequently. It is best not to use the glue method when there is a strong wind, because the "glue sticks" will not be sticky if they are covered with dirt.

IV. Sieve Trap: A rice-sifting sieve or a round dustpan can be used. Place the sieve or dustpan upside down on the ground, and prop up the edge of the sieve or dustpan with a small wooden stick. Tie a long rope to the small wooden stick, and sprinkle some millet on the ground under the sieve or dustpan. When sparrows come to eat the food, pull the rope, the small wooden stick will fall, and the sparrows will be trapped. This method is most effective on snowy days. After it snows, just sweep the ground under the sieve or dustpan clean, and the sparrows will definitely come here to find food, so it is extremely easy to catch them.

V. Trap: Ordinary rat traps can be used, but it is best to modify them for use. Small traps are most suitable. If using large traps, the support stick can be lengthened and the tether shortened. The most suitable form is to support it at almost 180 degrees, bury it in the soil, and only expose the birdseed. When sparrows come to peck at the food, they will touch the support stick that holds the food, the support stick will slip, and the sparrow will be trapped.

VI. Slingshot: Use a relatively thick iron wire to bend into an iron frame shape, tie two rubber bands to both ends of the iron wire, and then install a leather pouch at one end of the two rubber bands.

VII. Nest Excavation: Sparrows build nests in the gaps between tiles, wall holes, or tree holes. After climbing up the ladder, use your hands to take out the grass and sparrow eggs from the sparrow's nest. It is best to place a cloth bag at the entrance of the nest to prevent the sparrows from flying away. Some sparrow nests have two openings. It is best to dig from one opening and put a cloth bag at the other opening. This will not only clean out the nest, but also prevent the sparrows from flying away. After digging, fill the sparrow hole with broken bricks and plaster the outside with mud or ash. This will prevent them from breeding again. It is best to use this method at the same time as nearby residents, so that the sparrows have nowhere to hide and are easy to eliminate. When digging nests, it is best to wear masks and gloves, and tie a rope around your waist, with one end of the rope tied to a secure place, to ensure hygiene and safety.

There are many other methods, such as smashing with wooden boards and bricks. Practical work has proven that the method of flashlight illumination and hand capture is the most effective. This method is simple and easy to implement, and generally everyone can do it. The large net trap method is also very effective, but this kind of net is very expensive, and at the same time requires skilled techniques.

In addition, reconnaissance work is extremely important when catching sparrows. Dawn, when sparrows leave their nests, and dusk, when sparrows enter their nests, are the best times to scout sparrow activity. Whether catching during the day or digging nests at night, meticulous reconnaissance work must be done to avoid failure. Especially when digging nests at night, it is even more important to do a good job of reconnaissance. According to the habits of sparrows, they generally do not enter nests between winter and spring. At night, most of them roost under the eaves of houses that are sheltered from the wind and warm. During the catching process, it was also discovered that there are many sparrows in haystacks, firewood piles, fences, city walls, chicken coops, horse pens, woods, dry wells, and old buildings, and the masses can be mobilized to catch them.

    火器营农业社消灭麻雀的经验	北京市海淀区火器营农业社主任　段文奎
    北京市海淀区东冉村乡火器营消灭麻雀的主要经验：一方面是要把所有的群众发动起来，做到人人动手；另一方面是要使用各种各样的方法和工具，给麻雀撒上天罗地网，才能收到显著的效果。
    在发动群众方面：首先要向群众进行深入的宣传教育，使每一个人认识到消灭麻雀的意义，这样群众才能自觉地行动起来。其次要建立组织，统一领导。第三充分运用青少年的力量和充分发挥职业捕鸟人的作用。
    在捕捉麻雀的方法方面：必须掌握住“搜、捕、掏、堵”这四种办法和“稳、准、狠”的原则。主要的捕捉方法有以下几种。
    一，大网扣：用两块长约三丈六、宽约一丈二的线网，把两网的一端连结在一起，网的下边钉在地上，从上面看下去成“?”状，沿网的上部边缘穿上一根绳子，通到一个隐蔽的地方，人就守在这里。网里的地上放两只麻雀作引诱。等到很多麻雀进入网里，就用力拉网绳，网的上部边缘就合到一起，网就倒在地上，把网里面的所有麻雀全部扣住。用这种方法一次可以捉到几百只麻雀。最近，社员唐庆禄和学生刘振江，使用这种方法，一网就扣住二百五十九只麻雀。
    二，用手电筒照、手抓麻雀：一般麻雀都在屋檐下过夜。麻雀在黑暗里见到手电筒射出的强烈亮光后，就睁不开眼睛，也不能飞动，这个时候用手去捕捉非常容易。采用这种方法捕雀的时候，最好由二、三人配合进行。一人先用手电筒照住麻雀，一人扶住梯子，另一人上去捕捉。捉的时候动作必须轻快，并且不要让捉到的麻雀叫，以免惊动其他麻雀。如学生傅书申用这种方法，一晚上就捉住三十六只麻雀。
    三，胶粘：用苏子油四两，放在小沙锅内用微火熬，约二十分钟左右，倒出一部分，叫“稀胶”，作调和胶用，其余的再熬四十分钟左右，等到胶起了金黄色的泡沫以后就成稠胶，又叫老胶，再用木板捣搅以后就可以使用了。使用的时候，取二尺多长的荆条棍若干，把胶涂抹在这些荆条棍上，叫“胶尺”，根据具体情况，把“胶尺”插在树上、柴草垛、屋檐等处。根据麻雀喜欢迎风飞、迎风落的习性，所以要把“胶尺”迎风绑在各个地方，麻雀落在“胶尺”上就被粘住。粘到麻雀以后，“胶尺”上的雀毛要弄干净，否则别的麻雀不会继续往上落。绑“胶尺”的地方必须经常调换。刮大风的时候最好不用胶粘法，因为“胶尺”上沾了土就不黏了。
    四，筛子扣：用筛米的筛子或圆簸箩都可以。把筛子或簸箩扣在地上，用一根小木棍支起筛子或簸箩的边，小木棍上拴一根长绳，筛子或簸箩下面的地上撒一点小米，等麻雀来吃食的时候，一拉绳，小木棍就倒了，麻雀就被扣住了。这种方法在下雪天最有效。下雪以后单扫清筛子或簸箩下面的这块地面，麻雀一定到这儿来找食，所以极容易捉。
    五，夹子打：一般用的老鼠夹子都可以，最好改制一下使用。用小夹子最合适，如用大夹子时，可以把支棍改长一些，拴线改短一些，支成将近于一百八十度的形式最为适宜，埋在土里，外面只露出雀食，麻雀来啄食物时，碰着放食的支棍，支棍滑落后就把麻雀打住。
    六，弹弓打：用一条比较粗的铁丝，弯成铁架形状，在铁丝两头拴住两根橡皮带，再在两个橡皮带的一端安好皮斗即成。
    七，掏窝：麻雀都在瓦檐间、墙窟窿或树洞里筑窝。蹬梯子上去后，用手把麻雀窝里的草和雀蛋掏出来，窝口最好放一个布袋，以免麻雀飞跑。有的麻雀窝有两个洞口，最好从一个洞口掏，另一个洞口放好布袋，这样不仅能将窝里掏干净，麻雀也不致飞掉。掏完以后，用碎砖把雀洞填实，外面抹上泥或灰。这样就避免它们再来繁殖。使用这个办法，最好是和附近住户同时作，使麻雀无处躲藏，便于消灭。掏窝的时候最好带上口罩、手套，并且用绳子拴住自己的腰，绳子的一端拴在稳妥的地方，以便保证卫生和安全。
    其他如用木板砸、砖砸等还有很多方法。从实际工作里证明，以用手电筒照、手抓的方法最为有效。这种方法简单易行，一般人都可以作。大网扣的方法也很有效，不过这种网很贵，同时得有熟练的技术。
    此外，在捕捉麻雀时，作好侦察工作是极为重要的。在拂晓麻雀出窝及黄昏麻雀入窝时，是侦察麻雀活动的最好时间，不论白天捕打或晚间掏窝，都必须切实作好细致的侦察工作，才不会落空。特别是晚间掏窝时，更要作好侦察工作。根据麻雀的习性，在冬春之间，一般是不进窝，夜晚大部栖住在避风、暖和的屋檐下，在捕打中也发现草垛柴堆、篱笆墙、城墙、鸡圈、马圈、树林、枯井以及古老建筑物等处，有很多麻雀，都可以发动群众去捕打。
