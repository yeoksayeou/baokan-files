Xinhua News Agency, 8th Dispatch: The rectification campaign in the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the national committees of various industrial unions, and the directly affiliated institutions of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions in Beijing has now entered its third stage.

According to the rectification plan formulated by the Party Group of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the above units will focus on resolving five issues in the third stage: the guiding principles and tasks of trade union work, the structure of trade union organizations at all levels, work systems and methods, staffing levels, and the living standards of cadres. The Party Group emphasized that the overall goal of resolving all these issues is to overcome bureaucracy, subjectivism, and sectarianism in the work, and to strengthen the ties between the trade unions and the masses.

In order to accelerate the progress of the movement, Lai Ruoyu, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, made a mobilization report at a general meeting of all cadres of the directly affiliated organs of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions on November 6. In addition to explaining the significance of the rectification work in the third stage, he also emphasized the leadership's determination to improve its work. He said that the issue of the guiding principles and tasks of trade union work, which is one of the five issues to be resolved in the rectification, is a common problem in trade union organizations at all levels across the country. This issue was debated during the first stage of the rectification movement, the period of airing views and debates, and opinions from all sides have been expressed relatively fully. At present, as far as the leading cadres of trade unions at the provincial and municipal levels are concerned, the disordered thinking on the issue of the guiding principles and tasks of trade union work has been basically clarified, but it has not been completely resolved among the broad masses of trade union cadres. Therefore, in the third stage, it is still necessary to continue discussing this issue so that every staff member can clearly grasp the guiding principles and tasks of trade union work stipulated by the Central Committee. He also said that in order to smoothly resolve various work issues, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions itself will first solve the problem of bloated institutions, in order to set an example for other units. In addition to discussing the guiding principles and tasks of trade union work, other units should also focus on exposing shortcomings and errors in their work, finding solutions through airing views and debates, and making practical improvements.

Now all units have entered a new upsurge of airing views and debates. According to statistics from the ten departments directly under the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, since entering the third stage, 2,078 big-character posters have been put up. Some units have also established several special topic groups in order to promptly gather mass opinions and study improvement plans.

    全总和各产业工会出现新鸣放高潮
    党组制定整风计划提出整改阶段着重解决的问题
    新华社8日讯　中华全国总工会、各产业工会全国委员会及在北京的全总直属事业单位的整风运动，目前已经转入第三阶段。
    根据中共全国总工会党组制订的整风计划，在第三阶段中以上各单位将着重解决五个问题：工会工作的方针任务问题，各级工会组织的体制问题，工作制度和工作方法问题，人员的编制和干部的生活待遇问题。党组着重指出，所有这些问题的解决，总的目的是要克服工作中的官僚主义、主观主义和宗派主义，密切工会同群众的联系。
    为了加快运动的进展，全国总工会主席赖若愚11月6日在全总直属机关的全体干部大会上作了动员报告，除了说明第三阶段整改工作的重要意义以外，还着重表示了领导方面改进工作的决心。他说，在整改中所要解决的五个问题中的工会方针任务问题，是全国工会各级组织中普遍存在的问题。这个问题在整风运动的第一阶段即大鸣大放期间，就在工会系统展开了辩论，各方面的意见已经比较充分地发表了出来。目前，就省市以上的工会领导干部来说，对工会工作方针任务问题上的紊乱思想基本上澄清了，但是在广大工会干部中间还没有完全解决。因此，在第三阶段中，仍然需要对这问题继续进行讨论，使每个工作人员都能明确地掌握中央规定的工会工作的方针任务。他还说，为了顺利地解决各项工作问题，全总机关本身将首先解决机构臃肿问题，以便向各单位作出榜样。其他各单位除了进行有关工会工作方针任务的讨论以外，还应当着重揭露工作中的缺点、错误，通过大鸣大放和辩论，找出解决办法，切实加以改进。
    现在各单位都已经转入新的鸣放高潮。据全总直属的十个部门的统计，自转入第三阶段以来，已经贴出了二千零七十八张大字报。有些单位还成立了若干专题小组，以便及时集中群众意见和研究改进方案。
