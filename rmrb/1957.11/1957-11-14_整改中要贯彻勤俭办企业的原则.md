In Rectification, Implement the Principle of Running Enterprises Diligently and Frugally
By our reporter Ji Yin

Recently in Shanghai, it was discovered that a small number of factories, when implementing some measures for rectification while correcting, did not pay attention to implementing the policy of running enterprises diligently and frugally. They used excessive funds to satisfy some welfare demands raised by employees. Some things that could have been talked out of were done, and some things that did not require much money were done expensively. For example, some young workers at the Shanghai Soap Factory, during the recent airing of views, stated that the original basketball court was too dusty and demanded that the ground be rebuilt with cement. The factory then spent a lot of money to renovate the playground. The Shanghai Cable Factory not only spent several thousand yuan to build a cement basketball court (also used as a skating rink) but also spent more than 6,800 yuan to build an indoor gym and spent more than 700 yuan to install a diaper-drying device for the nursery. Some factories already had enough nurseries and dormitories but still wanted to build new nurseries and new family dormitories. Some factories even ruined the original good auditorium floor and rebuilt it with a new terrazzo floor to satisfy the young workers' demand for dancing.

It should be said that most of the specific opinions on living welfare raised by employees during the great airing of views (according to statistics from Shanghai pilot factories, these opinions account for more than a quarter of the total) are reasonable. Factory leaders should, during this rectification, quickly resolve them based on the opinions of the masses and possible conditions, to encourage the enthusiasm of the masses. However, when solving these problems, we must pay attention to spending less money and doing more things, and avoid extravagance and waste. We should guide the enthusiasm of the masses onto the road of building the country diligently and frugally, and running enterprises diligently and frugally. If we simply spend money to satisfy the demands of the masses, we will inevitably get the opposite effect. The handling of welfare issues should be combined with improving leadership style and implementing education on running enterprises diligently and frugally. The process of handling welfare issues should be turned into a vivid process of ideological education for leaders and employees. In this way, we can not only solve specific problems but also truly encourage the political enthusiasm of the employees and masses.

In the recent rectification, Shanghai State-Owned Cotton Mill No. 17 used this method to deal with a welfare problem raised by employees. There was a section of muddy road more than ten zhang long in the South Plant of State-Owned Cotton Mill No. 17. The terrain was very low, and it was damp all year round. It was slippery and rotten on rainy days, and during high tides, excrement overflowed from the sewers. Workers often slipped and fell when passing by. They had requested the renovation of this road a long time ago, but the leadership had not solved the problem in time in the past. During this airing of views, the workers brought up the old matter again, and the leadership also decided to solve it during the rectification. However, they did not adopt the method of contracting it out administratively and spending money to repair the road. Instead, they combined it with the activity of leading cadres participating in physical labor. Led by the deputy director and other leading cadres, they organized more than a dozen workers to do it themselves, using coal cinder from the factory's boiler room to pave the road and using waste cement blocks from the factory to line the edges of the road. The workers who made suggestions in the cleaning workshop were greatly moved when they saw the leading cadres repairing the road in the rain and came to participate together. In this way, without spending a penny, the road was quickly repaired. When dealing with such welfare issues, some factories, such as Shanghai State-Owned Cotton Mill No. 1, handed some unreasonable welfare demands over to the masses for discussion, and fierce debates were held with each other. In the end, the masses rejected those unreasonable demands, changing the passive situation of the leadership.

Judging from some factories in Shanghai that have already launched rectification, the fundamental issue of building the country diligently and frugally and running factories diligently and frugally has many ideological problems, especially in the large number of new joint state-private enterprises in Shanghai. Therefore, it is very necessary to emphasize this issue. However, in many factories in Shanghai, this topic has not yet been placed in its proper position.

    整改中要贯彻勤俭办企业的原则
    本报记者　季音
    上海最近发现少数工厂在执行边整边改的一些措施的时候，不注意执行勤俭办企业的方针，用过多的钱来满足一部分职工提出的福利要求，有的可以说服职工不办的事也办了，有的不必花很多钱的事也花了很多钱。例如，上海肥皂厂的一些青年工人，在这次鸣放中提出原来的篮球场灰尘太大，要求将操场的地面改筑成水泥的，厂里便花了许多钱重新翻修了操场。上海电缆厂不但花几千元修筑了一个水泥篮球场（兼作溜冰场），还花六千八百多元盖了一所室内健身房，用七百多元给托儿所设了个烘尿布设备。有的厂托儿所、宿舍本来够用了，还要修建新的托儿所和新的家属宿舍。甚至有的厂为了满足青年工人跳舞的要求，便将原来很好的礼堂地面挖坏，重修新的水磨地面。
    应该说，职工们在大鸣大放中提出来的许多生活福利方面的具体意见（据上海试点工厂的统计，这类意见约占总数的四分之一强），大部分是合理的。工厂领导上应当在这次整改中，根据群众的意见和可能的条件迅速解决，鼓舞群众的积极性。但是，解决这些问题的时候，一定要注意少花钱，多办事，不要铺张浪费。应该把群众的热情引导到勤俭建国、勤俭办企业的道路上去。如果单纯花钱来满足群众要求，必然得到相反的效果。福利问题的处理应当同改进领导作风、贯彻勤俭办企业的教育结合起来，把处理福利问题的过程反过来变成对领导和职工进行思想教育的生动过程。这样，既能解决具体问题，又可以真正鼓舞职工群众的政治积极性。
    上海国棉十七厂在最近的整改中，就曾用这个方法，处理了一件职工们提出的福利问题。国棉十七厂南厂房有一段十多丈长的泥路，地势很低，终年潮湿，下雨天又滑又烂，潮汛时，阴沟里还溢出粪来。工人经过那里时，常常要滑跌。他们很早就要求翻修这条道路，但是领导方面过去没有及时解决这个问题。这次鸣放中，工人们又旧事重提，领导方面也决心在整改中解决，但他们不是采取由行政上包下来花钱修路的办法，而是同领导干部参加体力劳动的活动结合起来，由副厂长等领导干部带头，组织了十多个工人自己动手，用厂里炉子间的煤渣铺路面，用厂里废水门汀块镶路边。清花间提意见的工人看到领导干部冒雨在修路，受到很大的感动，也一齐赶来参加。就这样没有花一分钱，很快就把这条路修好了。上海国棉一厂等部分工厂，在处理这类福利问题时，把一些不合理的福利要求交给群众去讨论，相互展开激烈的争辩，最后，群众否决了那些不合理的要求，改变了领导工作的被动局面。
    勤俭建国、勤俭办厂这个关系到国家建设的根本问题，从上海目前已开展整风的一些工厂中来看，这方面的思想问题不少，尤其是上海大量的新公私合营工厂，问题更多。因此特别强调一下这个问题是很有必要的。而上海的不少工厂中，现在却还没有把这个课题摆到它应有的位置上来。
