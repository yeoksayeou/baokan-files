Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 18th - According to TASS: The regular meeting of the Council of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers opened in Moscow on the 16th. Representatives from more than twenty countries are participating in the meeting.

    The President of the Association, Mr. Pritt, delivered the opening speech, in which he spoke of the great significance of the recent conference of legal workers from Asian and African countries. He said that cooperation among Asian and African countries, given the dangers of colonialism, is welcome.

    Pritt expressed regret that the Association still does not have consultative status within the United Nations. Then, the Secretary-General of the Association, Nordmann, gave a summary report of the Association's work. He said that in the past year and a half, the Association's work has developed due to the implementation of the resolutions and recommendations of the Brussels Congress. The Association pays close attention to issues such as peaceful coexistence, disarmament, the prohibition of the production and testing of atomic weapons, and strengthening the ties between legal workers in various countries. The Association has put forward the goal of uniting all progressive legal workers from all countries in the world who recognize the principle of peaceful coexistence (despite their differences in views on individual issues).

    Nordmann said that the meeting has two purposes: to enable legal workers' associations and individual legal workers from various countries to exchange work experiences and to formulate the future work guidelines of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers.

    Speaking about the participation of legal workers in the struggle to prevent war, Nordmann said that the Association should study the Eisenhower Doctrine's interference in the internal affairs of other countries from the perspective of international law, which would help to defend peace in the Near and Middle East.

    Nordmann introduced to the meeting participants some of the measures taken by the Association, including measures to protect Algerian legal workers persecuted by colonialists, measures to protect fighters in the Cypriot liberation struggle, and measures to protect people in other countries who are fighting for freedom and independence.

    国际民主法律工作者协会理事会开会
    倡导和平共处反对干涉内政
    新华社18日电　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：国际民主法律工作者协会理事会的例会16日在莫斯科开幕。有二十多个国家的代表参加了这次会议。
    协会主席普里特致开幕词，他谈到了不久以前召开的亚非国家法律工作者代表会议的重大意义。他说，鉴于殖民主义的危险，亚非国家进行合作，这是值得欢迎的。
    普里特对协会至今在联合国中没有咨询地位一点表示遗憾。接着由协会秘书长诺尔曼作了协会工作的总结报告。他说，最近一年半来这个协会的工作由于执行了布鲁塞尔代表大会的决议和建议而有了发展。协会非常注意和平共处、裁军、禁止原子武器的生产和试验、加强各国法律工作者的联系等问题。协会已经提出这样一个目标：把一切承认和平共处原则的世界各国进步的法律工作者（尽管他们对个别问题的看法有分歧）团结起来。
    诺尔曼说，这次会议有两个目的：使各国的法律工作者协会和法律工作者个人交流工作经验，制定国际民主法律工作者协会今后的工作方针。
    诺尔曼在谈到法律工作者参加防止战争的斗争时说，协会应该以国际法的观点来研究一下干涉别国内政的艾森豪威尔主义，这样做有助于保卫中近东地区的和平。
    诺尔曼向会议参加者介绍了协会所采取的一些措施，其中包括保护受殖民主义者迫害的阿尔及利亚法律工作者的措施，保护塞浦路斯解放斗争战士的措施以及保护其他国家中为自由和独立而奋斗的人的措施。
