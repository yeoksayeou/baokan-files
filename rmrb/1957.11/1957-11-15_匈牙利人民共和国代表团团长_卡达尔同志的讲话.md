Comrade Esteemed Supreme Soviet! Dear Comrades, Friends! Please allow me, on behalf of the Hungarian people, who are unwavering in their loyalty to the cause of socialism, the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, and the Hungarian Revolutionary Worker-Peasant Government, to extend to you, to all the Soviet people, and to the Leninist Party that leads the people, heartfelt, warm, and fraternal greetings! (Prolonged applause)

Today, as the Soviet people celebrate the 40th anniversary of the Great Revolution, they look back on the fruits of their victorious struggles over the past forty years. Today, the vast majority of people in every country in the world who support peace and human progress join the Soviet people in celebrating this holiday. And so it is that today the representatives of all conscious workers, peasants, and intellectuals in urban and rural Hungary also join the Soviet people in celebrating this holiday.

Forty years ago, the victorious banner of the Great October Socialist Revolution was unfurled. Just as no one can deny that there are stars in the sky, no one, not even the enemy, can deny that the Soviet Union exists on Earth. (Applause)

The Hungarian working people have also noticed the anxious articles appearing in the American and British newspapers, complaining that the Soviet Union has surpassed the United States and Britain in the scale and level of training scientific cadres and in the results of scientific research. The authors of these articles do not mention the social reasons for these achievements of world significance, but the Hungarian working people know that only the Soviet socialist system could have transformed this country from a country that forty years ago was known for its large number of illiterate people, superstition, and widespread backwardness, into a country that today leads the world in terms of the prosperity of science and culture and the development of society as a whole.

We, the Hungarian working people, are delighted with every achievement of the Soviet Union and are grateful to the Soviet people in many ways.

The modern industrial proletariat, armed with the theories of Marx and Engels, the founders of scientific socialism, has been holding high the banner of socialism and social progress, standing at the forefront of the people and nations of all countries, and fighting for the realization of this theory for more than a hundred years. Socialist theory became a reality thanks to the struggle of the Russian proletariat and Lenin's Bolshevik Party, and thanks to the victory of the Great October Socialist Revolution of 1917 and the establishment of the Soviet Union. (Applause) This victory not only meant a fundamental change in the fate of the peoples of the former Tsarist Russia, but also a historically significant milestone affecting the fate of all mankind.

The Hungarian working class, the Hungarian people, received a spiritual weapon from the Great October Socialist Revolution, from the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, from the passionate revolutionary Lenin, and with this weapon, the Hungarian people overthrew the oppression of landlords and capitalists thirty years ago, and established the Hungarian Soviet Republic on March 21, 1919. (Applause)

In 1944, the sons of the Great October Socialist Revolution came to us and, at the cost of their blood, drove the Hitler fascist bandits from the territory of Hungary, restoring the national independence and freedom of the Hungarian people.

Under the leadership of its revolutionary party, the Hungarian people were able to use the freedom they had gained to embark on socialist construction and take a giant step forward in the path of social development. Great achievements have been made on this path, but there have also been mistakes, and difficulties have arisen.

The 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union gave the Hungarian working class tremendous assistance in summing up good experiences in Marxism-Leninism and eliminating errors that hinder our continued progress. The theoretical and political principles used by the 20th Congress of the CPSU to enrich the world workers' movement, including us Hungarian revolutionaries, still occupy a prominent place in the spiritual arsenal of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party.

When a counter-revolutionary rebellion, instigated and supported by imperialists, broke out in Hungary in the autumn of 1956, the sons of the Great October Socialist Revolution came to the aid of the Hungarian people, to the aid of the Hungarian People's Republic, which was advancing along the socialist path.

Dear Comrades, Friends! We have no reason to boast, but as representatives of the Hungarian people, we can now openly and without shame speak here to you, to our friends who have come here from all over the world, that the assistance we have received has not been in vain! Loyal to the cause of socialism, we, the Hungarian people, with the help of the great Soviet people and with the support of our friends all over the world, have gathered the strength to fight back and have won an undeniable victory over the forces of imperialist counter-revolution. (Applause)

The Hungarian People's Republic has stood firm. Under the leadership of its revolutionary party, which is full of internationalist spirit, the Hungarian people continue to build a socialist society in Hungary. (Applause)

Comrades! On this great anniversary, the Hungarian Red fighters who once fought on the great Russian land in the Soviet Civil War, the fighters of the Hungarian Soviet Republic of 1919, the underground workers during the fascist Horthy regime, the founders of the Hungarian People's Republic, the people who fought back against the counter-revolutionary forces in 1956, and all the Hungarian people who are loyal to socialism, wish the fraternal, great Soviet people, their glorious Communist Party, their Supreme Soviet, and their government success, peace and happiness in their great constructive labor. (Applause)

Long live the heroic Soviet people and their Communist Party, and may the great Soviet state flourish! (Applause) May the friendship between the peoples of Hungary and the Soviet Union last forever! (Applause) Long live proletarian internationalism and the fraternal friendship of the peoples of all countries building socialism! Long live peace! (Prolonged applause)

    匈牙利人民共和国代表团团长
    卡达尔同志的讲话
    最敬爱的最高苏维埃！亲爱的同志们，朋友们！请允许我代表坚定不移地忠于社会主义事业的匈牙利人民、匈牙利社会主义工人党和匈牙利工农革命政府向你们，向全体苏联人民，向领导人民的列宁主义的党致以衷心的、热情的、兄弟般的敬礼。（经久不息的掌声）
    今天，苏联人民在庆祝伟大革命四十周年的时候，回顾自己在四十年当中所进行的胜利斗争的成果。今天，世界上任何一个国家里的绝大多数拥护和平和人类进步的人都同苏联人民一道来庆祝这个节日。正是这样，今天匈牙利城乡一切有觉悟的工人、农民和知识分子代表也同苏联人民一道来庆祝这个节日。
    四十年前展开了伟大的十月社会主义革命的胜利旗帜。正如任何人都不能否认天上有星星一样，任何人，就连敌人，也不能否认地球上有苏联存在。（掌声）
    匈牙利劳动人民还注意到美英报纸上出现的满腹焦虑的文章，它们抱怨苏联在培养科学干部的规模和水平以及从事科学研究工作的成果方面都超过了美国和英国。这些文章的作者，没有提到这些具有世界意义的成就的社会原因，但是匈牙利劳动人民知道，只有苏维埃社会主义制度才能使这个国家从四十年前被人称为有大量文盲、迷信和普遍落后的国家变成了今天从科学文化的繁荣及整个社会发展的角度来说全都走在世界各国前面的国家。
    我们匈牙利的劳动人民对苏联的每项成就都感到欢欣鼓舞，并且在许多方面都感激苏联人民。
    以科学社会主义奠基人马克思、恩格斯学说武装起来的现代产业无产阶级，高举着社会主义和社会进步的旗帜，站在各国人民和各民族的前列，并为实现这一理论而斗争，已经有一百多年了。社会主义理论因为有俄国无产阶级和列宁的布尔什维克党的斗争，由于1917年伟大十月社会主义革命的胜利和苏联的成立，而变成了现实。（掌声）这一胜利不仅意味着前沙皇俄国各族人民命运有了根本的转变，而且是影响全体人类命运的有历史意义的里程碑。
    匈牙利工人阶级，匈牙利人民，从伟大的十月社会主义革命，从苏联共产党，从热情的革命者列宁那里得到了一个精神武器，靠着这个武器，匈牙利人民在三十年前推翻了地主、资本家的压迫，并于1919年3月21日建立了匈牙利苏维埃共和国。（掌声）
    1944年，伟大十月社会主义革命的子弟来到我们这里，用他们的鲜血为代价，从匈牙利的国土上赶走了希特勒法西斯匪帮，恢复了匈牙利人民的民族独立和自由。
    匈牙利人民在自己的革命政党的领导下，能以利用所获得的自由，着手进行社会主义建设，并在社会发展道路的前进中迈出了巨大的一步。在这个道路上取得了巨大的成就，但同时也还有错误，并产生了困难。
    苏联共产党第二十次代表大会，在以马克思列宁主义总结优良的经验，以及消除阻碍我们继续前进的错误方面，给了匈牙利工人阶级以巨大的援助。苏共第二十次代表大会用以丰富的、包括我们匈牙利革命者在内的世界工人运动的那些理论和政治原理，直到现在在匈牙利社会主义工人党的精神武库里占居显著的位置。
    当1956年秋天匈牙利爆发了由帝国主义者策动和支持的反革命叛乱时，伟大十月社会主义革命的子弟便赶来援助匈牙利人民，援助沿着社会主义道路前进的匈牙利人民共和国。
    亲爱的同志们，朋友们！我们没有根据吹嘘，但是我们作为匈牙利人民的代表，现在可以公开地、毫不抱愧地在这里向你们，向从世界各地来到这里的我们的朋友们讲话，我们所得到的援助，并没有白费！忠于社会主义事业的我们匈牙利人民，靠着伟大苏联人民的援助，并在全世界朋友们的支持下，聚集了反击的力量，并且赢得了对帝国主义反革命势力的无可争辩的胜利。（掌声）
    匈牙利人民共和国站稳了脚根。匈牙利人民在自己的充满国际主义精神的革命政党的领导下，继续在匈牙利建设社会主义社会。（掌声）
    同志们！在这伟大的周年纪念日，曾经在苏联国内战争作战于伟大的俄国土地上的匈牙利红色战士们、1919年匈牙利苏维埃共和国的战士们、法西斯霍尔蒂专政时期的地下工作者们、匈牙利人民共和国的缔造者们、在1956年反击了反革命势力的人们，以及全体忠于社会主义的匈牙利人民，都祝兄弟的伟大苏联人民、他们的光荣的共产党、他们的最高苏维埃和政府在伟大的建设性劳动中取得成就，祝他们和平和幸福。（掌声）
    英勇的苏联人民及其共产党万岁，祝伟大的苏维埃国家繁荣昌盛！
  （掌声）祝匈苏两国人民的友谊万世永存！（掌声）无产阶级国际主义、建设社会主义的各国人民兄弟般的友谊万岁！和平万岁！（经久不息的掌声）
