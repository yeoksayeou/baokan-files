Xinhua News Agency, November 27th -- The Beijing Personnel Bureau and Religious Affairs Bureau have decided to further streamline their organizations and send more cadres down to labor positions for training.

The Beijing Personnel Bureau, which has already been reduced from thirty-two cadres to seventeen cadres, decided today to retain only eight cadres. The Beijing Religious Affairs Bureau, which has been reduced from sixteen cadres to nine cadres, decided to retain only four cadres. These two bureaus have already made arrangements for how to better carry out their work after the streamlining. They believe that further streamlining can further improve work efficiency.

This is the prelude to further streamlining organizations, reducing levels, and further delegating cadres in units under the Beijing People's Committee. When the person in charge of the Beijing People's Committee talked to Xinhua News Agency reporters about this issue, they believed that the further streamlining of these two bureaus is worth promoting as a typical example to all municipal units. At present, although the organizations of various agencies in Beijing have been streamlined, and some agencies have been streamlined more thoroughly, most agencies are still large in organization, large in personnel, and inefficient. Further thorough streamlining is needed to truly make them lean, able to closely connect with the masses, and efficient working organs of the people's government.

The Beijing Religious Affairs Bureau originally had sixteen cadres. During the first streamlining, nine people were retained, and three sections and one secretary's office were kept. Recently, it was decided to abolish all section offices and reduce another five people, leaving only four staff members. They plan to have one cadre do internal work, and the other two cadres, led by the director, will frequently go deep into the grassroots to study and solve practical problems.

The director of the Beijing Personnel Bureau pointed out at a meeting of all cadres held today that the Personnel Bureau used to have fifty or sixty cadres. This autumn, it was reduced from more than thirty people to seventeen, retaining one office and three sections. Now, based on the potential and work situation of the cadres, the sections can be completely abolished, and only eight cadres are needed. The vast majority of the streamlined cadres will participate in agricultural production and train themselves through labor. The cadres of this bureau unanimously supported this plan for further streamlining the organization in the discussion and put forward many suggestions for improving the work. Some cadres said: We have now streamlined the organization again with a revolutionary spirit, and in the future, it is even more important to carry out our work with a revolutionary spirit.

    机构要精干　效率要提高
    北京市两个局决定再次紧缩机构
    人事局只留八个干部，宗教事务局只留四个干部
    新华社27日讯　北京市人事局和宗教事务局决定再次紧缩机构，把更多的干部下放到劳动岗位上进行锻炼。
    由三十二个干部减少到十七个干部的北京市人事局，今天决定只留八个干部；由十六个干部减少到九个干部的北京市宗教事务局决定只留四个干部。这两个局对于精简以后如何更好地进行工作的问题已经作了部署。他们认为再次紧缩机构可以更进一步地提高工作效率。
    这是北京市人民委员会所属单位再次紧缩机构、减少层次和进一步下放干部的先声。北京市人民委员会负责人对新华社记者谈到这个问题的时候，认为这两个局这样进一步紧缩机构值得市属各单位作为典型加以推广。目前，北京市各机关的机构虽然经过紧缩，有的机关紧缩得也比较彻底，但多数机关仍然是机构大、人员多、效率不高，需要进一步进行彻底的紧缩，才能使它真正成为一个精干的、能密切联系群众的、效率高的人民政府的工作机关。
    北京市宗教事务局原有十六个干部，第一次紧缩时留下九人，保留了三个科和一个秘书室。最近决定把科室机构全部取消，再减去五人，只留四个工作人员。他们计划留一个干部做内部工作，另外两个干部由局长带领经常深入基层，研究和解决实际工作中的问题。
    北京市人事局局长在今天举行的全体干部会议上指出，人事局过去有五、六十个干部，今年秋天从三十多人减到十七人，保留了一个办公室和三个科，现在从干部的潜力和工作情况看来，科室完全可以取消，只留八个干部就行了，精简下来的干部绝大部分去参加农业生产，在劳动中锻炼自己。这个局的干部在讨论中一致拥护这个进一步紧缩机构的方案，并且提出了许多改进工作的意见。有的干部说：我们现在用革命的精神再次紧缩了机构，今后更重要的是要以革命的精神来进行工作。
