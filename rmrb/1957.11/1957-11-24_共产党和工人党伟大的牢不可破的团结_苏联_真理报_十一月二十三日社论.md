The "Pravda" yesterday published the communique of the meeting of representatives of the Communist and Workers' Parties of the socialist countries held in Moscow from November 14 to 16, 1957, and the declaration adopted at this meeting.

The "Pravda" today publishes the communique of the meeting of representatives of the Communist and Workers' Parties held in Moscow from November 16 to 19, 1957, and the Peace Manifesto adopted at this meeting.

The meetings of the Communist and Workers' Parties and the documents adopted at these two meetings mark a new and important stage in the development of the world communist movement, in further strengthening the great strength of the socialist camp, and in the struggle of the people of all countries for world peace. These two meetings were held in the capital of the Soviet state during the days when the Soviet people, the working people of all countries, and all progressive mankind solemnly celebrated the fortieth anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution, which opened a new era in world history.

The Moscow meetings reflected the tremendous ideological and political upsurge of the entire world communist and workers' movement. This was the most representative and broadest international conference in the history of the international communist movement. The meeting powerfully demonstrated the great and unbreakable unity and solidarity of the Communist and Workers' Parties, which have more than 33 million members and work on the basis of Marxist-Leninist ideas. The meeting was conducted in an atmosphere of close cooperation and sincerity, which showed the interrelationship between the brotherly parties united by the ideological unity of Marxist-Leninism and the principles of proletarian internationalism.

The declaration unanimously adopted by the representatives of the Communist and Workers' Parties of the socialist countries is a document of great historical significance. It summarizes the great experience of the Communist and Workers' Parties of the socialist camp. The achievements and experiences of the socialist countries in building a new society have a decisive influence on the awakening of the working people of the world. The declaration of the representatives of the Communist and Workers' Parties of the socialist countries also summarizes the experience of the workers' movement in capitalist countries and the national liberation struggle of the people in colonial and dependent countries. In analyzing all the most important issues of the contemporary era, it demonstrates a high degree of Marxist-Leninist principle and flexibility, and sets an example for the Communist and Workers' Parties to creatively apply and develop Marxist-Leninist theory.

The declaration extensively describes the fundamental changes that have taken place in the balance of power on the world stage in recent times. The declaration emphasizes that the main content of our era is the transition from capitalism to socialism, which was started by the Great October Socialist Revolution in Russia. Now, more than 950 million people, accounting for more than one-third of the world's population, have embarked on the road of socialism and are building a new life. The tremendous development of socialist forces has encouraged the tremendous development of the anti-imperialist national movement after the war. In the past twelve years, in addition to the People's Republic of China, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, more than 700 million people have shaken off the colonial shackles and established their own nationally sovereign states. The people of colonies and semi-colonies who are still enslaved are strengthening their struggle for national liberation.

The development of socialism and the national liberation movement has drastically accelerated the process of imperialism's demise. Imperialism has lost its original control over most of mankind. For forty years, socialism has proved that it is a far superior social system to capitalism. The ever-growing and consolidating world socialist system is exerting an increasingly greater influence on the international situation, thereby helping the cause of peace, progress, and people's freedom.

The US imperialist aggressive blocs, which are pursuing a "position of strength" policy, are hindering the progress of mankind. Under the banner of "anti-communism", they attempt to dominate more and more countries, strive to eliminate democratic freedoms, threaten the national independence of developed capitalist countries, try to reimpose colonial shackles on the people who have already been liberated in new forms, and constantly carry out hostile subversive activities against socialist countries. The policy of certain aggressive groups in the United States is to gather all the reactionary forces of the capitalist world around themselves. In this way, these groups become the center of reactionary forces around the world and the most ferocious enemies of the masses.

At present, the most important task in the world is the struggle to defend peace. The declaration emphasizes that the mighty forces of our time safeguarding the cause of peace are: the indestructible socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union; the peace-loving countries of Asia and Africa that stand against imperialism and together with the socialist countries constitute a vast area of peace; the international working class, especially its vanguard – the Communist Party; the liberation movement of the people of colonies and semi-colonies; the mass movement of the people of all countries for peace; and the people of European countries that have declared neutrality, the people of Latin America, and the masses in imperialist countries who resolutely resist the planning of a new war. The union of these powerful forces can prevent the outbreak of war, and if the imperialist warmongers insist on launching a war regardless of everything, then imperialism is doomed to perish, because the people will never continue to tolerate the system that brings them such heavy pain and sacrifice.

As emphasized in the declaration and the Peace Manifesto, the Communist and Workers' Parties regard the struggle for peace as their primary task. They are all striving to act jointly with all peace-loving forces that do not want war in the broadest possible scope. The participants in the meeting declared that they support all the efforts of any country, party, group, movement, and individual to safeguard peace and oppose war, and support all their efforts for peaceful coexistence, the establishment of collective security in Europe and Asia, arms reduction, and the prohibition of the use and testing of nuclear weapons.

The problem of strengthening the unity and fraternal cooperation among socialist countries, Communist and Workers' Parties of various countries, and strengthening the unity of the international workers' movement, the national liberation movement, and the democratic movement occupies an important position in the declaration. The unity of the Communist and Workers' Parties is the core of the unity of all democratic and peace-loving forces and is the basic guarantee for the victory of the cause of the working class. They bear particularly important historical responsibilities for the fate of the world socialist system and the international communist movement. In the declaration, the Communist and Workers' Parties of the socialist countries declare that "for the benefit of the further unity of the socialist family, for the benefit of the international workers' movement and the cause of peace and socialism, they will unswervingly strengthen their unity and comradely cooperation with each other." The foundation of the interrelationships between the countries of the world socialist system and between the Communist and Workers' Parties of the world is the Marxist-Leninist principle that has been tested by life, and the principle of proletarian internationalism. The declaration states that at present, it is in the fundamental interest of the working people of all countries to support the Soviet Union and all socialist countries, which are implementing the policy of safeguarding world peace and are the bastion of peace and social progress. What the working class, democratic forces, and working people of all countries are concerned about is the continuous consolidation of fraternal ties for the common cause, the maintenance of the historical, political, and social achievements of the first and most powerful socialist country, the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and all socialist countries, so that they are not subject to any conspiracy by the enemies of socialism, and the expansion and consolidation of these achievements.

The mutual assistance of socialist countries powerfully embodies the socialist principle of internationalism. The meeting emphasized that in the future, the socialist countries will continue to expand and improve their economic and cultural cooperation; they know that the solidarity of the socialist countries is a reliable guarantee of the national independence and sovereignty of every socialist country. In order to consolidate the fraternal relations and friendship among the socialist countries, the Communist and Workers' Parties must implement the Marxist-Leninist policy of internationalism, educate all working people in the spirit of combining internationalism and patriotism, and resolutely overcome the remnants of bourgeois nationalism and chauvinism.

The fact that the representatives of the Communist and Workers' Parties of the socialist countries affirmed that the Communist and Workers' Parties participating in the meeting were in agreement on the fundamental issues of socialist revolution and socialist construction is of particular significance. The declaration, from the Marxist-Leninist standpoint, summarizes the main laws that are the foundation of the struggle for socialism, which are: the working class, with the Marxist-Leninist party as its core, leads the working masses to carry out proletarian revolution in this or that form and to establish proletarian dictatorship in this or that form; the establishment of an alliance between the working class and the basic masses of the peasantry and other working strata; the elimination of capitalist ownership of the basic means of production and the establishment of public ownership of the basic means of production; the gradual realization of the socialist transformation of agriculture; the planned development of the national economy in order to build socialism and communism and improve the living standards of the working people; the implementation of the socialist revolution in the ideological and cultural spheres to create a strong intelligentsia loyal to the working class, the working people, and the cause of socialism; the elimination of national oppression and the establishment of equality and fraternal friendship among all nationalities; the protection of the fruits of socialism from infringement by enemies at home and abroad; the implementation of proletarian internationalism and solidarity with the working class of all countries.

The creative application of common principles in accordance with the characteristics and specific historical conditions of each country, and the diversification of specific forms and methods of socialist construction, are the collective contributions of the Communist and Workers' Parties to Marxist-Leninist theory.

The meeting's further study of the question of the forms of transition from capitalism to socialism in various countries is one example of a creative attitude towards the strategic and tactical issues of the working-class struggle. The meeting pointed out that, owing to the profound historical changes and great leaps in the balance of forces on the international stage that favor socialism, and the growing appeal of socialist ideas among the working class, working peasants, and working intellectuals, more favorable conditions have been created for the victory of socialism. Under the present conditions, in some capitalist countries, the working class, led by its advanced troops, has the possibility, on the basis of the workers' front and the people's front, on the basis of agreements in various possible forms between different parties and social groups, and the establishment of various possible forms of political cooperation, to unite the majority of the people and obtain state power without civil war, so as to ensure that the basic means of production are transferred to the hands of the people. In this case, the degree of intensity of the class struggle and the forms it takes depend less on the proletariat and more on the extent to which the reactionary groups resist the will of the vast majority of the people, and whether these groups resort to violence in this or that stage of the struggle for socialism. In this case, it is necessary to see another possibility, that is, a non-peaceful transition to socialism.

At the present stage, it is of great significance to strengthen the struggle against various opportunist factions in the workers' movement and the communist movement. The meeting emphasized that it is necessary to resolutely overcome revisionism and dogmatism in the ranks of the Communist and Workers' parties. Revisionism and dogmatism in the workers' movement and the communist movement have been and are international in nature. Dogmatism and sectarianism hinder the development of Marxist-Leninist theory, hinder the creative application of this theory under constantly changing specific conditions, replace the study of specific situations with quoting scriptures and mechanically memorizing books, and separate the party from the masses. While opposing dogmatism, the Communist Party believes that under the present conditions, the main danger is revisionism, or right-wing opportunism, which is a manifestation of bourgeois ideology, paralyzes the revolutionary will of the working class, and demands the preservation or restoration of capitalism.

The declaration emphasizes that it is of paramount importance to apply dialectical materialism in the practical work of the Communist Party, to educate the masses with Marxism-Leninism, to fight against bourgeois ideology, to expose the imperialist propaganda's slander and vilification of the socialist and communist movements, and to widely disseminate the ideas of socialism, peace, and friendship among nations in a popular, understandable, and profoundly vivid form.

The strength of the international communist movement is united, and this strength is indeed boundless.

The declaration states that "contrary to the imperialist nonsense of the so-called 'crisis of communism', the communist movement is developing and consolidating. The historic resolutions of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union are not only of great significance for the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the communist construction of the Soviet Union, but also opened a new stage in the international communist movement, promoting its further development on the basis of Marxism-Leninism. The success of the recent congresses of the Communist Parties of China, France, Italy, and other countries powerfully demonstrates the unity of their ranks and their loyalty to the principles of proletarian internationalism. The meeting of representatives of the Communist and Workers' Parties demonstrates the international solidarity of the communist movement."

The declaration of the representatives of the Communist and Workers' Parties of the socialist countries has given all fighters for peace, democracy, and socialism greater confidence in their own strength and has opened up a bright prospect for the brilliant future of mankind.

The inspiring call in the declaration for the working class and the people of all countries to further unite and make new great victories for the cause of peace, democracy, and socialism on a world scale has been enthusiastically responded to by the working people of all countries. Reports from all parts of the Soviet Union indicate that our entire party and all our people unanimously support the declaration adopted by the Communist and Workers' Parties of the socialist countries. The people of all nationalities of the Soviet Union, who have entered their fifth decade and are loyal to their internationalist responsibilities, will, under the leadership of the Communist Party and under the banner of Marxism-Leninism, strive with unremitting energy to achieve the sacred goal of all mankind - the building of communism.

    共产党和工人党伟大的牢不可破的团结
    ——苏联“真理报”十一月二十三日社论
    “真理报”昨天刊载了1957年11月14日至16日在莫斯科召开的社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议公报和这次会议所通过的宣言。
    “真理报”今天刊载了1957年11月16日至19日在莫斯科召开的共产党和工人党代表会议公报和这次会议所通过的和平宣言。
    共产党和工人党的会议和这两次会议所通过的文件标志着，在发展世界共产主义运动方面、在进一步加强社会主义阵营的强大力量方面和在各国人民争取世界和平的斗争方面进入了新的重要阶段。这两次会议是在苏联人民、各国劳动人民和全体进步人类隆重地庆祝打开世界历史新纪元的伟大十月社会主义革命四十周年的日子里在苏维埃国家首都举行的。
    莫斯科会议反映了整个世界共产主义运动和工人运动的巨大的思想和政治高潮。这是国际共产主义运动史中最富有代表性的、最广泛的国际会议。会议有力地表明拥有三千三百万以上党员并在马克思列宁主义思想基础上进行工作的共产党和工人党的伟大的、牢不可破的一致和团结。会议是在密切合作和真诚的气氛中进行的，这种情况表明了以马克思列宁主义思想意识的一致，以无产阶级国际主义原则联合在一起的各兄弟党的相互关系。                              
    社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议所一致通过的宣言，是一个具有重大历史意义的文件。它总结了社会主义阵营各国共产党和工人党的伟大经验。社会主义国家建设新社会的成就和经验对全世界劳动人民的觉悟有决定性的影响。社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议宣言同时还总结了资本主义国家工人运动的经验以及殖民地和附属国人民的民族解放斗争的经验。它在分析当代一切最重要的问题时，表现了高度的马克思列宁主义原则性和灵活性，树立了共产党和工人党创造性地运用马克思列宁主义理论并发展这种理论的范例。
    宣言广泛描述了最近时期在世界舞台上力量对比方面发生的根本变化。宣言强调指出，我们时代的主要内容是由俄国伟大十月社会主义革命所开始的由资本主义向社会主义的过渡。现在，占世界人口三分之一以上的九亿五千多万人已经走上了社会主义道路，正在建设新生活。社会主义力量的巨大发展鼓励了战后反帝国主义的民族运动的巨大发展。在最近十二年内，除了中华人民共和国、越南民主共和国、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国以外，还有七亿多人挣脱了殖民枷锁，建立了自己的民族主权国家。仍然受奴役的殖民地和半殖民地的人民，正在加强争取本民族的解放的斗争。
    社会主义和民族解放运动的发展剧烈地加速了帝国主义的没落过程。帝国主义已经丧失了对于大部分人类的原有统治。四十年来，社会主义证明了它是比资本主义远为优越的社会制度。日益壮大和巩固的世界社会主义体系，正在给予国际局势越来越大的影响，从而帮助了和平、进步和人民自由的事业。
    执行“实力地位”政策的美国的帝国主义侵略集团妨碍着人类的进步。它们打着“反共”的幌子，企图统治越来越多的国家，力图消灭民主自由，威胁发达的资本主义国家的民族独立，想要以新的形式给已经解放了的人民重新套上殖民枷锁，并且经常不断地对社会主义国家进行敌对的颠覆活动。美国某些侵略集团的政策是要把资本主义世界的一切反动势力集结在自己的周围。这样，这些集团就成为全世界反动势力的中心，成为人民群众的最凶恶的敌人。
    目前全世界最重要的任务是保卫和平的斗争。宣言中强调指出，维护着和平事业的是当代的这些强大的力量：不可摧毁的以苏联为首的社会主义阵营；站在反帝立场上并且同社会主义国家一起构成广大和平地区的亚非爱好和平的国家；国际工人阶级，首先是它的先锋队——共产党；殖民地和半殖民地人民的解放运动；世界各国人民争取和平的群众运动；坚决反抗新战争策划的，还有欧洲宣布中立各国的人民，拉丁美洲的人民以及帝国主义国家的人民群众。这些强大力量的联合可以阻止战争的爆发，如果帝国主义的战争狂人硬要不顾一切发动战争，那么帝国主义就注定灭亡，因为人民绝不会再继续容忍那个给他们带来如此惨重的痛苦和牺牲的制度。
    正像宣言和和平宣言中所强调指出的，共产党和工人党认为争取和平的斗争是自己的首要任务。它们都在争取同一切爱好和平而不愿意战争的力量在最广泛的范围内共同行动。会议参加者声明，他们支持任何国家、政党、团体、运动和个人维护和平、反对战争的一切努力，支持他们为和平共处、建立欧洲和亚洲的集体安全、裁减军备、禁止使用和试验核武器的一切努力。
    加强社会主义国家、各国共产党和工人党之间的团结和兄弟合作问题，加强国际工人运动、民族解放运动和民主运动的团结问题在宣言中占据重要地位。共产党和工人党的团结是一切民主和爱好和平力量团结的核心，是工人阶级事业胜利的基本保证。他们对世界社会主义体系和国际共产主义运动的命运负有特别重大的历史责任。社会主义国家共产党和工人党在宣言中声明，“为了社会主义各国大家庭的进一步团结的利益，为了国际工人运动以及和平和社会主义事业的利益，它们将始终不渝地加强彼此间的团结和同志式的合作。”世界社会主义体系各国之间以及世界各国共产党和工人党之间相互关系的基础，是为生活所考验过的马克思列宁主义原则，是无产阶级国际主义原则。宣言中说，目前，各国劳动者对于执行维护世界和平政策的并且是和平和社会进步的堡垒的苏联和所有社会主义国家给以支持，是符合他们的切身利益的。各国工人阶级、民主力量和劳动者所关切的，是为了共同事业不断地巩固兄弟联系，是维护第一个和最强大的社会主义国家苏联、中华人民共和国和所有社会主义国家所取得的历史、政治和社会成果，使它们不受社会主义敌人的任何阴谋所侵犯，并且扩大和巩固这些成果。
    社会主义各国的互相援助有力地体现了社会主义的国际主义原则。会议着重指出，今后，社会主义各国将继续扩大和改善它们之间的经济和文化合作；它们知道，社会主义各国的团结一致，是每一个社会主义国家的民族独立和主权的可靠保证。为了巩固社会主义各国间的兄弟关系和友谊，共产党和工人党必须执行马克思列宁主义的国际主义政策，用国际主义和爱国主义相结合的精神教育全体劳动人民，坚决克服资产阶级民族主义和沙文主义的残余。
    这样一个事实具有特别重大的意义：社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议肯定了参加会议的共产党和工人党在社会主义革命和社会主义建设的根本问题上的意见是一致的。宣言从马克思列宁主义的立场出发，总结了作为争取社会主义的斗争的基础的那些主要规律，这些规律是：以马克思列宁主义政党为核心的工人阶级，领导劳动群众进行这种形式或那种形式的无产阶级革命，建立这种形式或那种形式的无产阶级专政；建立工人阶级同农民基本群众和其他劳动阶层的联盟；消灭基本生产资料资本主义所有制和建立基本生产资料的公有制；逐步实现农业的社会主义改造；有计划地发展国民经济，以便建成社会主义和共产主义，提高劳动人民的生活水平；进行思想文化领域的社会主义革命，造成忠于工人阶级、劳动人民和社会主义事业的强大的知识分子队伍；消灭民族压迫，建立各民族间的平等和兄弟友谊；保卫社会主义果实，不让它受到国内外敌人的侵犯；实行无产阶级的国际主义，同各国工人阶级团结一致。
    根据每个国家的特点和具体历史条件对共同原则的创造性运用，社会主义建设具体形式和方法的多样化，是共产党和工人党对马克思列宁主义理论的集体贡献。
    会议对各国从资本主义向社会主义过渡的形式问题所作的进一步研究是对工人阶级斗争的战略和策略问题采取创造性态度的范例之一。会议指出，由于国际舞台上的力量对比有利于社会主义的深刻历史变化和巨大跃进，社会主义思想的吸引力在工人阶级、劳动农民和劳动知识分子中的增长，为社会主义的胜利创造了更加有利的条件。在目前条件下，在一些资本主义国家里，以自己的先进部队为首的工人阶级，有可能在工人阵线和人民阵线的基础上，在不同的党派和社会团体达成各种可能形式的协议和建立各种可能形式的政治合作的基础上，把大多数的人民团结起来，不经过内战而取得国家政权，从而保证使基本生产资料转入人民手中。在这种情况下，阶级斗争的剧烈程度和所采取的形式，与其说是决定于无产阶级，不如说是决定于反动集团对于绝大多数人民的意志抵抗到什么程度，决定于在争取社会主义斗争的这一或那一阶段上这些集团是不是采取暴力。在这种情况下，必须看到另一种可能性，那就是不是和平地过渡到社会主义。
    在现阶段中，加强反对工人运动和共产主义运动中的各种机会主义流派的斗争，具有重大的意义。会议强调指出，必须在共产党和工人党的队伍中坚决克服修正主义和教条主义。工人运动和共产主义运动中的修正主义和教条主义，无论过去和现在都带有国际性质。教条主义和宗派主义妨碍马克思列宁主义理论的发展，妨碍在不断变化的具体条件下创造性地运用这一理论，用引经据典和死啃书本来代替对具体情况的研究，使党脱离群众。在反对教条主义的同时，共产党认为，在目前条件下，主要的危险是修正主义，或者说右倾机会主义，它是资产阶级意识形态的表现，它麻痹工人阶级的革命意志，要求保存或者恢复资本主义。
    宣言强调指出，具有头等重要意义的是，在共产党的实际工作中运用辩证唯物论，用马克思列宁主义教育群众，同资产阶级的意识形态进行斗争，揭露帝国主义宣传对社会主义和共产主义运动的造谣诬蔑，通过通俗易懂和深刻生动的形式广泛宣传社会主义、和平和各民族友好的思想。
    国际共产主义运动的力量是团结一致的，这种力量的确无穷无尽。
    宣言中说，“同帝国主义所谓‘共产主义危机’的胡说相反，共产主义运动正在发展和巩固。苏联共产党第二十次代表大会的历史性决议，不但对于苏共和苏联的共产主义建设具有伟大的意义，而且开辟了国际共产主义运动的新阶段，促进了它在马克思列宁主义基础上的进一步发展。中国、法国、意大利和其他国家共产党最近时期召开的代表大会的成功，有力地说明了它们的队伍的团结一致，说明了它们对于无产阶级国际主义原则的忠实。这次共产党和工人党代表的会议，证明了共产主义运动的国际团结。”
    社会主义各国共产党和工人党代表会议的宣言使一切争取和平、民主和社会主义的战士对自己的力量有了更大的信心，打开了争取人类光辉未来的灿烂前景。
    宣言中要求各国工人阶级和各国人民更进一步团结、使和平、民主和社会主义事业在世界范围内取得新的伟大胜利的这一令人振奋的号召，得到各国劳动人民的热烈响应。来自苏联全国各地的报道说明，我们全党和全体人民都一致拥护社会主义各国共产党和工人党通过的宣言。已经进入第五个十年的、忠于国际主义职责的苏联各族人民，在共产党的领导下，在马克思列宁主义的旗帜下一定会以毫不放松的精力争取实现全人类的神圣目标——建成共产主义。
