Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, November 17th. The Indonesian Red Cross delegation, which returned here on the 16th, issued a statement explaining that its withdrawal from the International Red Cross Conference after the US proposal was passed was "a protest against a certain aspect of the International Red Cross Conference being insulted, and at the same time a demonstration of self-respect and politeness."

The International Red Cross Conference plenary session, recently held in New Delhi, passed a US proposal on November 7th, under US pressure, to allow Chiang Kai-shek clique elements to attend the meeting under the name of the so-called "Republic of China." The Chinese delegation attending the meeting immediately lodged a strong protest and withdrew from the meeting. Delegations from more than ten countries, including India, the Soviet Union, and Indonesia, also withdrew from the meeting in protest.

The Indonesian Red Cross delegation stated in its statement that the reasons for the delegation's withdrawal from the meeting were the same as those of the Indian delegation.

The statement believes that "the resolution to allow the Chiang gang to attend the meeting was passed under pressure from a certain party. We believe this is an act of power politics that insults other countries."

    印度尼西亚红十字会代表团
    斥美国破坏国际红十字大会
    新华社雅加达17日电　16日回到这里的印度尼西亚红十字会代表团发表声明，说明了它在国际红十字大会会议通过美国提案之后随即退出会议是“对某一方面侮辱国际红十字大会的做法表示抗议，同时这也是一种自尊和礼貌的表示。”
    最近在新德里举行的国际红十字大会全体会议，11月7日曾经在美国的压力下通过了要让蒋介石集团分子以所谓“中华民国”的名义出席会议的美国提案。参加会议的中国代表团立即提出强烈的抗议，并且退出会议。印度、苏联、印度尼西亚等十多个国家的代表团也退出了会议，表示抗议。
    印度尼西亚红十字会代表团在声明中说，代表团退出会议的理由同印度代表团是一致的。
    声明认为，“准许蒋帮出席会议的决议是在某一方面的压力之下通过的。我们认为这是一种侮辱别的国家的强权行为。”
