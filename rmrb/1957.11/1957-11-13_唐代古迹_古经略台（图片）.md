    Tang Dynasty Relic - Ancient Jinglüe Terrace
    The Zhenwu Pavilion on the Ancient Jinglüe Terrace in Rong County, Guangxi Province, is a large ancient wooden structure. It was built using the principle of leverage. The three-story building does not use a single nail. The weight around the top of the pavilion is balanced. The four central pillars on the second floor, which connect to the top of the pavilion, are suspended in the air, about five or six fen (a traditional unit of length) above the floor. The entire building is supported by only twenty wooden pillars, none of which are set into walls or have foundations.
    According to historical records, the Jinglüe Terrace was built during the Qianyuan period of the Tang Dynasty. During the Wanli period of the Ming Dynasty, the site was expanded, and the existing Zhenwu Pavilion was built. It is a rare national classical building in China since the Tang and Song Dynasties.

    唐代古迹——古经略台
    广西省容县古经略台上的真武阁，是一座古代的大型木结构建筑。它是运用杠杆原理建成的，三层楼不用一颗钉子，阁顶四周重量平衡，第二层楼上通阁顶的四条中央大柱悬空吊起，约离楼面五、六分，全座建筑只用二十根木柱支撑，都没有落墙脚和打地基。
    据史料记载，经略台为唐乾元时所建，至明万历年间扩大基址并修筑了现存的真武阁。为唐宋以来，我国稀有的民族古典建筑。图为古经略台外景。  新华社记者　谭志强摄
