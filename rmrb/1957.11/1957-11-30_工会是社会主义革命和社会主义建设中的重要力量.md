Trade unions are mass organizations of the working class. Under the leadership of their advanced troops—the Communist Party—they rely on the unity and consciousness of their class to fight against the exploiters, overthrow the system of exploitation, and establish a happy society without exploitation. Therefore, trade unions are the first mass organizations in history with a clear class nature and are the most revolutionary.

Class nature and mass character are the characteristics of trade union organizations. Class nature and mass character dictate that they must fight to protect and strive for the greatest interests of their class.

China's handicraft workers carried out struggles very early on to resist the cruel exploitation of handicraft owners. After the emergence of modern industrial workers, the struggles became more frequent and their scale became larger. Such constant struggles could not be without an organization. Chinese workers very early had organizations such as "guilds" and "gangs." "Guilds" and "gangs" are organizational forms that inevitably emerged during handicraft production. They are different from trade union organizations. "Guilds" are organizations of producers to jointly deal with consumers in order to protect the interests of their industry; "gangs" are often organizations of people from the same place or a certain group of people to protect the interests of that place or that group of people. They are not organizations of the working class. Before the working class was formed, these organizations were not harmful to the workers; they were needed by some of the masses. However, when modern industrial workers appeared, these organizations could no longer meet the needs. At this time, the unity of the working class was needed, but "guilds" and "gangs" could not play the role of uniting the working class, and their existence would even undermine this unity.

The establishment of Chinese trade unions was after the establishment of the Chinese Communist Party. From the beginning, it accepted socialist ideas and, under the leadership of the Communist Party, carried out a vigorous revolutionary struggle. The slogan "Fight for freedom! Fight for human rights!" put forward by the "February 7th" General Strike in 1923 shows that the Chinese working class was already a conscious class. Before the establishment of the Chinese Communist Party, Chinese workers also carried out many struggles. However, the struggles of that period were spontaneous and were aimed at improving the immediate living conditions of the workers. Therefore, this kind of struggle could not shake the ruling foundation of the ruling class; it did not belong to the socialist trade union movement. However, this kind of struggle can educate the workers and provide them with struggle experience. This also created conditions for the workers to accept the socialist trade union movement. The fact that Chinese workers accepted the propositions of the Communist Party relatively quickly is inseparable from the struggles they had carried out in the past and the experience they had gained in the struggles.

After the establishment of the Chinese trade union, it organized and led the workers to carry out struggles against imperialism and against reactionary rule. At the same time, it also carried out struggles to improve their own living conditions and social status. Such as the Canton-Hong Kong strike, which lasted for two years, the nationally shocking "February 7th" General Strike, the historically famous three armed uprisings of Shanghai workers, and many subsequent strike struggles. On the eve of China's liberation, in order to cooperate with the War of Liberation before liberation, the workers carried out a struggle to protect factories and oppose relocation. This series of struggles tempered the ranks of the working class and shook the reactionary rule of imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek clique. These struggles wrote a glorious page in the history of the Chinese revolution and made a significant contribution to the liberation of China. Trade union organizations played a significant role in these works. It is precisely because the Chinese trade union led the workers in carrying out unyielding struggles for the liberation of China that the Chinese trade union has prestige among the working masses. The history of the Chinese trade union movement is a glorious history.

After China's liberation, the working class rose to become the leading class of the country. The imperialists who oppressed and exploited the workers have been driven out of China, and feudalism and bureaucratic capitalism have also been overthrown. Although capitalists still exist, they also have to carry out socialist transformation under the leadership of the working class. In this situation, what do we need trade unions for?

After the working class is liberated, it is necessary to consolidate the state led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance. To consolidate such a country, it is necessary to have the correct leadership of the Party and the government, and it is also necessary to have the support of the broad masses of the people, especially the working class. To get the support of the workers, the policies and laws of the state must reflect the greatest interests of the working class. Therefore, the state needs to listen to the opinions of the workers. However, the state cannot consult with each worker one by one. This requires an organization to reflect the opinions and demands of the workers.

To consolidate the state led by the working class, it is necessary to do a good job in production and improve labor productivity. This requires the state to formulate correct plans and formulate enterprise management systems that are suitable for the situation. At the same time, it also requires workers to treat labor with the attitude of masters. This requires a lot of work to be done among the workers, and an organization is needed to do this work.

The Party's line and policies need to be consciously implemented by the workers, the influence of bourgeois ideology on the workers also needs to be criticized and eliminated, and the cultural and technical level of the workers also needs to be continuously improved. The Party, the Communist Youth League, and enterprise administrations can do a lot of work in these areas; at the same time, a mass organization is also needed to do these tasks.

In the plan for developing the national economy, the state includes the improvement and improvement of the living conditions of the workers in the plan. However, it is not enough to rely on this aspect alone to improve the lives of the workers. It is also necessary for the workers to organize themselves to solve the problems that they can solve themselves. Such as mutual assistance and hardship subsidies. At the same time, it is also necessary to educate workers to live frugally. These works are also difficult to carry out without an organization of the workers themselves.

The arduous tasks of socialist construction require the close unity and hard work of the working class to be realized. To unite all workers, it also needs an organization that can unite all workers.

All this shows that after the working class is liberated, it still needs an organization that can unite the working class and carry out work among the workers. The trade union is such an organization. It cannot be replaced by any other organization. The Party is the highest organizational form of the working class, and it is the leader and command of the working class. Only the advanced and outstanding elements of the working class can join the Party organization. The Party cannot be, and should not be, a mass organization of the working class. The Communist Youth League is an organization of young people, and it works among young people. It is not convenient to organize all workers into the Communist Youth League organization. The trade union is a mass organization of the working class. It does not distinguish between advanced and backward thinking, nor does it distinguish between young and old. As long as one is a worker, one can apply to join the trade union if one is willing. Therefore, after the working class is liberated, it not only needs the trade union organization, but also needs to strengthen it so that it can play a greater role.

The trade union organizations in our country after liberation have been greatly strengthened compared with before liberation, and have played a greater role. Judging only from the situation of trade union members, there were only more than 2.8 million people at the Sixth National Labor Congress held in Harbin in 1948 before China's liberation; however, less than five years later, at the Seventh Congress in 1953, it reached more than 10.02 million people; and now there are more than 16 million people. This on the one hand shows the situation of industrial development in our country; on the other hand, it also shows the situation of the growth of trade union organizations in our country and their extensive contact with the masses.

After liberation, the Chinese trade union not only expanded its organization, but also carried out tremendous work among the workers. In organizing workers' labor competitions, giving play to the labor enthusiasm and creativity of the workers, in raising the awareness level and cultural and technical level of the workers, in caring for the material life of the workers and organizing the cultural life of the workers, it has done a lot of work and achieved great results. This also proves the important role of trade union organizations in socialist construction and their important position in society.

Trade union organizations are an important force in socialist revolution and socialist construction, and they are an arduous and important work position. Trade union workers must do a good job in their responsibilities, study hard and work hard under the leadership of the Party. We must attach importance to trade union work and do a good job in trade union work.

    工会是社会主义革命和社会主义建设中的重要力量	张修竹
    工会是工人阶级的群众组织，它在它的先进部队——共产党领导下，依靠本阶级的团结和觉悟的力量，来同剥削者进行斗争，推翻剥削制度，建立没有剥削的幸福的社会。所以工会是历史上第一个具有明确阶级性的、最革命的群众组织。
    阶级性、群众性是工会组织的特点。阶级性和群众性就规定
  了它要为保护和争取本阶级的最大利益而斗争。
    我国的手工业工人，在很早的时候，为了反抗手工业主的残酷剥削就进行过斗争。近代产业工人出现后，斗争更多，其规模也就更大了。这样不断的斗争，不能没有个组织。中国工人很早就有“行会”、“帮派”的组织。“行会”、“帮派”是手工业生产时必然出现的一种组织形式。它和工会组织不同。“行会”是生产者为了保护本行业的利益共同对付消费者的组织；
  “帮派”往往是同一地方的人或者是某一部分人为了保护这一地方的人或者某一部分人的利益的组织。它们都不是工人阶级的组织。这种组织，在工人阶级还没有形成之前，对工人没有什么坏处，它是一部分群众所需要的。可是当近代产业工人出现后，这种组织就不能适应需要了。这时，需要工人阶级的团结，而“行会”、“帮派”不能起工人阶级团结的作用，它的存在，还会破坏这种团结。
    中国工会的成立是在中国共产党成立以后。它一开始就接受了社会主义思想，在共产党的领导下，进行了轰轰烈烈的革命斗争。1923年“二七”大罢工提出的“为争取自由而战！为争取人权而战！”的口号，就说明中国工人阶级已经是觉悟了的阶级了。中国共产党成立以前，中国工人也进行过多次斗争。可是，那个时期的斗争是自发的，是为了改善工人眼前生活上的问题。因而这种斗争，不能动摇统治阶级的统治基础；它也就不属于社会主义的工会运动。但是，这种斗争可以教育工人，可以给工人提供斗争经验。这也就给工人接受社会主义的工会运动创造了条件。中国工人较快地接受了共产党的主张，是与过去进行了斗争和在斗争中取得了经验分不开的。
    中国工会成立以后，就组织和领导了工人进行反对帝国主义、反对反动统治的斗争。同时也进行了改善自身生活状况和社会地位的斗争。如坚持了两年的省港大罢工，震动全国人心的“二七”大罢工，历史上有名的上海工人三次武装起义，以及以后的多次罢工斗争。在我国解放前夕，工人为了配合解放前的解放战争，进行了护厂反迁斗争。这一系列的斗争，锻炼了工人阶级的队伍，摇撼了帝国主义、蒋介石集团的反动统治。这些斗争，在中国革命史上写下了光辉的史页，对中国的解放也是有重大贡献的。而这些工作，工会组织起了重大作用。也正由于中国工会领导了工人为中国的解放进行了不屈不挠的斗争，中国工会在工人群众中是有威信的。中国工会运动史是一部光荣的历史。
    中国解放以后，工人阶级升为国家的领导阶级了。压迫和剥削工人的帝国主义已被赶出中国，封建主义、官僚资本主义也被打倒。资本家虽然还存在，但他也不得不在工人阶级领导下进行社会主义改造。在这种情况下要工会干什么呢？
    工人阶级获得解放以后，就要巩固工人阶级领导的以工农联盟为基础的国家。要巩固这样的国家，需要党和政府的正确领导，也需要广大人民特别是工人阶级的支持。要工人支持，国家的政策法令就要反映工人阶级的最大利益。因此，国家就需要听取工人的意见。可是国家不能一个工人一个工人地去商量。这就需要一个组织来反映工人的意见和要求。
    要巩固工人阶级领导的国家，就要把生产搞好，提高劳动生产率。这需要国家制定出正确的计划，制定出适合情况的企业管理制度。同时也需要工人以主人翁的态度对待劳动。这就需要在工人中进行许多工作，需要一个组织来作这项工作。
    党的路线和政策需要工人自觉地贯彻，资产阶级的思想对工人的影响，也需要批判和清除，工人的文化技术水平也需要不断提高。党、团、企业行政在这些方面可以作许多工作；同时也需要一个群众组织来作这些工作。
    国家在发展国民经济的计划中，是把提高和改善工人的生活状况安排在计划之内的。可是工人生活的改善只靠这一方面是不够的，还需要工人组织起来解决自己可以解决的问题。如互助和困难补助等。同时也还需要教育工人勤俭地生活。这些工作，如果没有一个工人自己的组织也是难于进行的。
    社会主义建设的艰巨任务，需要工人阶级紧密团结、辛勤劳动才能实现。要把全体工人团结起来，也需要一个能够团结全体工人的组织。
    这一切都说明了，工人阶级获得解放以后，还是需要一个能够把工人阶级团结起来并向工人进行工作的组织，工会就是这样的一个组织。它不是其他任何组织所能代替的。党是工人阶级的最高组织形式，是工人阶级的领导者、司令部。工人阶级中的先进者，优秀分子才能加入党的组织。党不能是、也不应该是工人阶级的群众组织。团是青年的组织，它是向青年进行工作的，不便于把全体工人组织到团的组织中去。工会是工人阶级的群众组织，它不分思想先进还是落后，也不分青年还是老年，只要是工人，自己愿意，就可以申请加入工会。所以，工会组织在工人阶级获得解放以后，不仅仅需要它，而且需要加强它，使它发挥更大的作用。
    我国解放以后的工会组织比之解放以前是大大加强了，也更大地发挥了作用。仅以工会会员的情况看，中国解放前夕，1948年在哈尔滨召开的全国第六次劳动大会时，只有二百八十多万人；可是相隔不满五年，1953年第七次大会时就达到一千零二十多万人；而现在已有一千六百多万人了。这一方面说明了我国工业发展的情况；另一方面也说明了我国工会组织壮大和广泛地联系了群众的情况。
    在解放以后，中国工会不仅组织扩大了，还在工人中进行了巨大的工作。在组织工人劳动竞赛，发挥工人的劳动积极性和创造性方面，在提高工人的觉悟水平和文化技术水平方面，在关心工人的物质生活和组织工人的文化生活方面，都作了许多工作，有了很大成绩。这也证明了工会组织在社会主义建设中的重要作用和在社会上的重要地位。
    工会组织是社会主义革命和社会主义建设中的重要力量，是一个艰巨而重要的工作岗位。工会工作者要作好自己担负的工作，就要在党的领导下，努力学习，辛勤工作。要重视工会工作，要作好工会工作。
