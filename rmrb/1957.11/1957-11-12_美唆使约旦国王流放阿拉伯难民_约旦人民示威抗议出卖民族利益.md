Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, November 11th: According to Damascus newspapers on the 10th, King Hussein of Jordan and U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Benson, who recently visited Jordan, have reached an agreement on a conspiracy to relocate Palestinian Arab refugees.

The report said that Hussein agreed to transfer Palestinian Arab refugees from Jordanian cities and the Jordan-Israel demarcation line area to the desert area between Shilah and Ma'an in southern Jordan, near the Saudi Arabian border, as soon as possible.

This is a long-planned conspiracy by the United States. As early as April this year, after the United States instigated a coup in Jordan, the United States and the pro-Western government of Jordan attempted to move Palestinian Arab refugees with strong anti-imperialist sentiments out of the aforementioned areas, in an attempt to stabilize the reactionary rule of Jordan and pave the way for the collusion between Jordan and Israel, two confidants of the United States in the region. At that time, due to the opposition of the Jordanian people and the people of other Arab countries, this conspiracy could not be realized. The newspaper report said that U.S. and Jordanian officials believe that now is the best time to carry out this conspiracy because Syria and Egypt are currently busy dealing with the possible aggression against Syria.

The Jordanian people strongly oppose the Jordanian rulers' act of selling out national interests. Residents of cities such as Amman, Irbid, Nablus, Zerqa, Jerusalem, Ramallah, Jericho, and Tulkarm are still holding demonstrations to protest the U.S.-Hussein conspiracy. Jordanian troops are on alert in various cities with mass demonstrations.

The newspaper report also said that the U.S. Ambassador to Jordan told Hussein that the United States believes that the recent mass demonstrations in Jordan are a great danger to the "Eisenhower Doctrine" and U.S. interests in Jordan. The U.S. Ambassador stated that his government is prepared to build detention camps in the desert for those "dangerous elements." The U.S. military attache in Jordan has gone to the desert to select sites for the proposed detention camps.

### 美唆使约旦国王流放阿拉伯难民  约旦人民示威抗议出卖民族利益

    美唆使约旦国王流放阿拉伯难民
    约旦人民示威抗议出卖民族利益
    据新华社大马士革11日电　据大马士革报纸10日报道，约旦国王侯赛因同最近访问约旦的美国农业部长本逊已经就阴谋迁移巴勒斯坦阿拉伯难民问题达成协议。
    消息说，侯赛因同意尽快把巴勒斯坦阿拉伯难民从约旦的城市和约旦—以色列分界线地区转送到沙特阿拉伯边境附近、约旦南部的什拉赫和马昂之间的沙漠地区。
    这是美国策划已久的一个阴谋。早在今年4月美国在约旦策动政变以后，美国和约旦的亲西方政府就曾经企图把具有强烈反帝国主义情绪的巴勒斯坦阿拉伯难民迁移出上述地区，想由此稳定约旦的反动统治，并且为美国在这个地区的两个心腹——约旦和以色列的勾结铺平道路。当时由于约旦人民和其他阿拉伯各国人民的反对，这个阴谋没有能够实现。报纸的消息说，美国和约旦的官员认为，目前是进行这种阴谋的最好时机，因为叙利亚和埃及目前都在忙着对付叙利亚可能遭到的侵略。
    约旦人民强烈反对约旦统治者出卖民族利益的行为。安曼、伊尔比德、纳布鲁斯、泽林、耶路撒冷、拉马拉、杰里科和图尔卡姆等城市的居民仍然在举行示威，抗议美国—侯赛因的阴谋。约旦军队正在有群众示威的各城市进行警戒。
    报纸的消息还说，美国驻约旦大使曾经对侯赛因表示，美国认为约旦最近的群众示威是对于“艾森豪威尔主义”和美国在约旦的利益的极大的危险。美国大使表示，他的政府准备为那些“危险分子”在沙漠中建造拘留营。美国驻约旦的武官已到沙漠中去为拟议中的拘留营选择地点。
