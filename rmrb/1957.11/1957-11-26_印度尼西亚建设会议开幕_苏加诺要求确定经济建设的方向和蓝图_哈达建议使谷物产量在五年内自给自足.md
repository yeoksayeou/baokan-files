Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, November 25th: The Indonesian National Construction Conference officially opened in Jakarta today. More than 300 central and local military and government leaders, economic experts, and advisors are participating in the conference to discuss major issues related to national construction.

The conference is chaired by President Sukarno and former Vice President Hatta.

In his opening speech, President Sukarno pointed out that the task of the conference is to study how to realize the ideals of the Indonesian Declaration of Independence, determine the direction of Indonesia's national economic construction, and formulate a blueprint for construction.

President Sukarno said that convening this conference is also to implement Article 38 of the Indonesian Provisional Constitution, namely, the state regulates important production institutions as well as land, rivers, and underground resources.

President Sukarno also said that the conference will also recommend the establishment of a National Planning Council.

Former Vice President Hatta then gave a long report at the meeting. After describing the economic construction situation he saw in countries such as China, he pointed out that the focus of Indonesian construction should be on the production of goods closely related to people's daily lives.

Hatta suggested that the conference make a decision to achieve self-sufficiency in Indonesia's grain production within five years. Hatta advocated that economic construction should be carried out under guidance. Major and large-scale construction projects should be operated by the government and cooperatives, but private enterprises should also be given ample opportunity to exert their initiative. Private enterprises can jointly operate with state-owned enterprises, so that private capital can obtain more profits. He also believes that foreign debt can be used as construction funds. Hatta also believes that the Indonesian economy cannot develop into a capitalist economy because there are no conditions for development.

Prime Minister Djuanda said in his speech that the current cabinet basically accepts the Five-Year Construction Plan drafted by the previous cabinet, but the current cabinet is willing to listen to the amendments to this plan proposed by this conference.

Prime Minister Djuanda believes that dispersing limited national funds to local undertakings will harm national construction.

He also pointed out that if frequent borrowing from foreign countries continues, it will lead the country into the "abyss of bankruptcy."

All the representatives of the provinces and autonomous regions invited to participate in this conference, except for the representative of the West Sumatra Autonomous Region and the Commander of the Central Sumatra Defense Region, Hussein, have attended the meeting. Hussein has written to Prime Minister Djuanda, stating that he does not intend to participate in this conference.

    印度尼西亚建设会议开幕
    苏加诺要求确定经济建设的方向和蓝图  哈达建议使谷物产量在五年内自给自足
    新华社雅加达25日电　印度尼西亚全国建设会议今天在雅加达正式开幕。中央和地方的军政领导人员、经济专家和顾问等一共三百多人参加这次会议，讨论有关国家建设的重大问题。
    会议由苏加诺总统和前副总统哈达担任主席。
    苏加诺总统在开幕词中指出，这次会议的任务是研究怎样去实现印度尼西亚独立宣言的理想，确定印度尼西亚国民经济建设的方向和制订建设的蓝图。
    苏加诺总统说，召开这次会议也是为了实现印度尼西亚临时宪法第三十八章，即由国家管制重要的生产机构以及陆地、海河和地下的富藏。
    苏加诺总统还说，这次会议还将建议设立一个国家计划委员会。
    前副总统哈达接着在会上作了长篇报告。他叙述了他在中国等国家看到的经济建设的情况以后指出，印度尼西亚建设的焦点应当放在同人民日常生活息息相关的物品的生产上。
    哈达建议会议作出决定，使印度尼西亚的谷物生产量在五年内作到自给自足。哈达主张经济建设应当有指导地进行。主要的、大规模的建设工程应当由政府和合作社去经营，但是也应当使私营企业有充分发挥它们的积极性的机会。私营企业可以同国营企业联合经营，这样私人资本可以获得更多的利润。他并且认为可以借外债来作建设资金。哈达还认为印度尼西亚经济不可能发展成为资本主义经济，因为没有发展的条件。
    朱安达总理在讲话中说，现内阁基本上接受上届内阁起草的五年建设计划，但是现内阁愿意听取这次会议就这个计划提出的修改意见。
    朱安达总理认为，把有限的国家资金分散使用在地方事业上，将会使国家建设受到损害。
    他还指出，如果经常向外国借款，就会把国家引导到“破产的深渊”中去。
    所有被邀请参加这次会议的各省和自治区的代表，除了西苏门答腊自治区的代表和中苏门答腊防区司令侯赛尼以外，都已经出席会议。侯赛尼已经写信给朱安达总理，表示他不准备参加这次会议。
