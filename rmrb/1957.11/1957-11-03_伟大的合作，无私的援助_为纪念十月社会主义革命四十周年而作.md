Great Cooperation, Selfless Assistance
——Written in Commemoration of the 40th Anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution
Ye Jizhuang

We celebrate the 40th anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution with boundless excitement, joy, and gratitude, celebrating this grandest festival that inspires working people all over the world, celebrating the great victory of Marxism-Leninism. Forty years ago, the Russian proletariat, under the leadership of the Bolshevik Party headed by Lenin, victoriously realized the proletarian revolution and established the first socialist state in the world, thus opening a new era in human history, namely, a new era of the collapse of capitalism and the rise of socialism.

The great October Socialist Revolution promoted the international communist movement and the colonial national liberation movement, and opened a new era in the relations between countries and nations. In the relations between socialist countries, not only are the Five Principles suitable, but also the principles of Marxism-Leninism. In order to seek a common high tide of mutual economy, socialist countries are conducting active economic cooperation and mutual assistance on the basis of equality, mutual benefit, and mutual cooperation. This close economic cooperation, with the continuous development of the economies of socialist countries, is not only rapidly expanding in scale, but also increasingly enriched in content, which is of great significance for strengthening the strength of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and defending world peace. It should be particularly pointed out that the Soviet Union, which has always been faithful to the principle of proletarian internationalism, always gives other socialist countries more various selfless assistance in the economic cooperation of socialist countries.

The Soviet Union's proletarian internationalist spirit of selfless assistance to fraternal countries is also fully reflected in the economic cooperation between China and the Soviet Union. When China faced the arduous task of restoring the national economy in the early days of liberation, the Soviet Union provided China with huge economic and technical assistance, which made a great contribution to China's rapid recovery of the national economy severely damaged by the long-term war, stabilizing the domestic market, and strengthening national defense. When China entered the period of the first Five-Year Plan for economic construction, the Soviet government and people further gave China greater assistance. The Soviet Union is helping China build 211 large-scale construction projects, including 205 industrial enterprises. These enterprises have become the central content of China's socialist industrial construction. For the construction of these industrial enterprises, the Soviet Union has given meticulous friendly assistance from collecting factory construction materials, surveying, selecting factory sites, designing, supplying equipment, guiding construction and installation and operation, training talents, supplying technical materials and drawings, to producing new products, so that China can complete a large number of new construction and renovation tasks of existing enterprises more, faster, better and more economically during the first Five-Year Plan for economic construction. By the end of this year, 67 projects aided by the Soviet Union during China's first Five-Year Plan period will be completed and put into production one after another, such as the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, Shenyang First Machine Tool Plant, Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Plant, Shenyang Pneumatic Tool Plant, Harbin Electric Meter Instrument Plant, Fuxin Haizhou Open-Pit Mine, Hegang Xing'an Terrace Vertical Shaft, Fuxin Power Station, Zhengzhou Thermal Power Station, and many important projects of Anshan Iron and Steel Company. The putting into production of these projects has played a decisive role in laying the foundation of socialist industry in China during the first Five-Year Plan period. The putting into production of these projects has not only greatly increased China's industrial production, but also enabled China to produce a large number of varieties that could never be produced in the past. For example, China can now produce more than 370 kinds of steel this year, more than double that of 1952, and can produce more than 3,000 kinds of steel products, more than six times that of 1952; China can now produce heavy-duty trucks, jet aircraft, various forms of automatic lathes and machine tools, and so on. These great achievements are inseparable from the great selfless assistance of the Soviet Union.

The Soviet Union's assistance to China's agriculture, water conservancy, transportation, and other aspects is also full of indescribable great friendship. The "State-owned Friendship Farm," established with machine equipment donated by the Soviet Union and with the help of Soviet experts, has created considerable wealth for the Chinese people for many years and has accumulated valuable experience in large-scale reclamation of wasteland. With the help of the Soviet Union, China has begun to build a great project for the comprehensive utilization of the Yellow River, and is now carrying out basin planning for the comprehensive development of the Yangtze River. The recently opened Asia's largest railway bridge - the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, has also received Soviet assistance in important materials and the most advanced technology. The successful construction of these many huge and modern enterprises and projects are all crystallization of the great Sino-Soviet friendship.

In order to help China build modern factories and mines, in recent years, the Soviet Union has transferred thousands of experts from its intense and enthusiastic communist construction to China. Soviet experts with a high degree of internationalist spirit have painstakingly provided China with systematic technical assistance. At the same time, they unreservedly taught advanced science and technology and rich work experience to Chinese technicians and workers, so that they could quickly master new production technology and manage new enterprises. From 1953 to the present, the Soviet Union has also accepted more than 7,000 Chinese interns to intern in its factories with advanced technical equipment, so that they can master various advanced technologies that can ensure the timely start of production of new factories in China in a very short period of time.

Since the founding of China, the Soviet Union has given China loans with extremely preferential terms several times, totaling 5.294 billion yuan in RMB, enabling China to obtain a large supply of construction materials from the Soviet Union, which has played an important role in the recovery and development of China's national economy. The various preferential terms of the Soviet Union's loans to China are unprecedented in the history of China's foreign debt and impossible in the capitalist world. After the great development of China's economy in recent years, China is now in a better position to rely on its own accumulation for construction.

Foreign trade is a major form of economic cooperation between China and the Soviet Union. Since the two governments signed a trade agreement in 1950, Sino-Soviet trade has achieved rapid and great development. This year, China's total import and export trade with the Soviet Union accounts for about 50% of China's total foreign trade, an increase of nearly three times compared with the Sino-Soviet trade volume in 1950. The materials supplied to us by the Soviet Union are all the machinery and equipment, industrial materials, various raw materials, scientific instruments, and daily necessities that are indispensable for China's recovery of the national economy and the realization of socialist industrialization. During the first Five-Year Plan period, the Soviet Union supplied about 3,000 various metal cutting machine tools, more than 2 million tons of ferrous metals, tens of thousands of agricultural machinery, and scientific instruments worth about 100 million yuan in RMB. The Soviet Union also supplied us with a considerable amount of sugar, cotton, cloth, paper, medicine, etc., which helped to continuously improve the lives of the Chinese people. The materials supplied to us by the Soviet Union not only meet China's needs as much as possible in terms of time and quantity, but also are of first-class quality. The materials supplied to the Soviet Union by China are also necessary for the Soviet Union to develop the national economy and improve the people's lives. The continuous development of Sino-Soviet trade plays a huge role in promoting the economic high tide of the two countries and improving the people's lives, especially in promoting China's socialist industrialization.

Sino-Soviet trade fully reflects the unparalleled superiority of economic cooperation in the socialist camp. Our two countries' trade is carried out in accordance with the principles of equality and mutual benefit, combining needs and possibilities, and mutual assistance and cooperation. Our trade is developing in a planned and solid manner on the basis of the continuous high tide of the national economies of both sides, and has many common conditions for mutual convenience. Our trade fundamentally does not have the phenomenon of price soaring and plummeting caused by economic crises, speculation, and other factors in the capitalist world market, which is conducive to the planned economic construction and trade development of both sides.

The facts in recent years have made it clear that through Sino-Soviet trade, the Soviet people have given the Chinese people great support. Moreover, due to the development of Sino-Soviet trade, the so-called "embargo" of the United States imperialism against China has been completely defeated.

The increasing development of Sino-Soviet scientific and technological cooperation is an important sign of the closer economic cooperation between the two countries. In October 1954, the governments of China and the Soviet Union signed a scientific and technological cooperation agreement. In recent years, the Soviet Union has not only sent a large number of experts to help China rapidly improve its scientific and technological level and accepted a large number of Chinese interns to study advanced technology in the Soviet Union; but also supplied a large amount of various technical materials to China and accepted various Chinese experts to conduct technical inspections in the Soviet Union. Since 1954, the Soviet Union has supplied more than 3,000 technical materials to China and accepted nearly 700 inspection experts dispatched by China. The Soviet Union is actively helping China develop the peaceful use of atomic energy. The Soviet Union not only vigorously helped China build an atomic reactor, but also jointly established the "Joint Nuclear Research Institute" with China and other socialist countries last year. In order to further promote the development of science and technology in China, the direct connection between Soviet scientific research institutions and the corresponding departments in China has been greatly strengthened. Through this connection, the two sides will exchange scientific research work plans, scientific and technological information, scientific works, etc., and jointly conduct special scientific research work. In scientific and technological cooperation, we also try our best to introduce some of our accomplished science and technology to the Soviet Union. Since 1954, China has supplied nearly 300 technical materials in industry, agriculture, transportation, etc. needed by the Soviet Union, and accepted more than 200 Soviet experts to inspect technical experience in planting certain crops, manufacturing daily necessities, and medicine and health in China.

Sino-Soviet scientific and technological cooperation is of great significance for China to solve technical problems in production and construction, so that the most urgently needed departments can catch up with the world's advanced scientific and technological level faster, and for the practical application of new technologies. Through scientific and technological cooperation, the Soviet people contribute the highly scientific and technological achievements they have achieved in construction and scientific research since the forty years of the October Revolution to the Chinese people who are as close as brothers to them. The Soviet Union helps China cultivate our own technical forces in all aspects, which will enable China to achieve complete technical independence in the shortest period of time.

The economic cooperation between China and the Soviet Union has also adopted or often adopts forms such as holding various exhibitions and sending professional delegations to visit each other. These have also played a significant role in promoting China's economic development and the great friendship between the two peoples.

The Chinese people will never forget the great encouragement given by the Soviet people to the Chinese people in the difficult years of the Chinese people's revolutionary struggle since the victory of the October Revolution, and will never forget the comprehensive, long-term, huge, and selfless assistance given by the Soviet people to China's socialist construction. The Chinese people have deeply realized from the long-term practice of revolution and construction that true friendship and assistance can only come from the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union and the international proletariat.

Now China is about to start the construction of the second Five-Year Plan. In order to gradually build China into a great socialist industrial country more, faster, better, and more economically, and in order to strive for lasting world peace, we must continue to hold high the banner of the October Revolution and proletarian internationalism, further strengthen the friendly unity of the Chinese and Soviet people, learn from our great ally, the Soviet Union, better, conscientiously, and wholeheartedly, and further consolidate and develop economic cooperation between the two countries in a planned way.

    伟大的合作，无私的援助
    ——为纪念十月社会主义革命四十周年而作
    叶季壮
    我们怀着无比兴奋、愉快和感激的心情来庆祝十月社会主义革命四十周年，庆祝这个全世界劳动人民欢欣鼓舞的最盛大的节日，庆祝马克思列宁主义的伟大胜利。四十年前，俄国无产阶级在以列宁为首的布尔什维克党的领导下，胜利地实现了无产阶级革命，在世界上建立了第一个社会主义国家，从而开辟了人类历史上的新时代，即资本主义崩溃和社会主义兴盛的新时代。
    伟大的十月社会主义革命推动了国际共产主义运动和殖民地民族解放运动，并为各国和各民族的关系开辟了一个新时代。在社会主义各国的关系中，不仅适合五项原则，而且还有马克思列宁主义原则。为了求得相互经济的共同高涨，社会主义各国在平等互利和互助合作的基础上进行着积极的经济合作和相互支援。这种密切的经济合作，随着社会主义各国经济不断发展，不仅在规模上迅速扩大着，而且在内容上也日益丰富着，对于加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的力量和保卫世界和平有着巨大意义。要特别提出的是：一贯忠实于无产阶级国际主义原则的苏联，在社会主义各国的经济合作中，它总是更多地给予其他社会主义国家以各种无私的援助。
    苏联对兄弟国家无私援助的无产阶级国际主义精神，在中苏两国经济合作中，同样充分地体现出来。当我国解放初期面临着恢复国民经济的艰巨任务的时候，苏联在经济和技术方面给予我国巨大援助，对于我国迅速恢复遭受长期战争严重破坏的国民经济、稳定国内市场和加强国防力量有了巨大的贡献。当我国进入第一个五年计划经济建设时期，苏联政府和人民又进一步给了我国更大的援助。苏联正在帮助我国建设二百一十一项规模巨大的工程项目，其中有二百零五个工业企业。这些企业成为我国社会主义工业建设的中心内容。对于这些工业企业的建设，苏联从搜集建厂资料、勘察、选择厂址、设计、供应设备、指导建筑安装和运转、训练人才、供应技术资料和图纸一直到生产出新产品来，都给予无微不至的友好帮助，使我国在第一个五年计划经济建设中，能够更多、更快、更好、更省地完成了大量企业的新建和原有企业的改建任务。到今年年底以前，苏联在我国第一个五年计划期间援助我国建设的项目，将有六十七项陆续建成并投入生产，例如第一汽车制造厂、沈阳第一机床厂、哈尔滨量具刃具厂、沈阳风动工具厂、哈尔滨电表仪器厂、阜新海州露天矿、鹤岗兴安台立井、阜新电站、郑州火电站以及鞍山钢铁公司许多重要工程等等。这些项目的投入生产，对于我国在第
  一个五年计划期间奠定社会主义工业的基础，起
  了决定性的作用。这些项目的投入生产，不仅使
  我国工业生产量大为增加，而且使我国能够大量地生产出过去从来不能生产的品种。例如：今年我国已能生产三百七十多种钢，比1952年增加一倍多，能生产三千多种规格的钢材，比1952年增加
  六倍多；我国已能生产载重汽车、喷气式飞机、多种形式的自动车床和机床等等。这些巨大的成就，同苏联的伟大的无私的援助是分不开的。
    苏联对我国农业、水利事业、交通运输业以及其他各个方面的援助，也充满着难以形容的伟大友谊。由苏联赠送机器设备和在苏联专家帮助下建立起来的“国营友谊农场”，已连年为我国人民创造了可观的财富，并且积累了大规模开垦荒地的宝贵经验。在苏联的帮助下，我国已开始建设综合利用黄河的伟大工程，现在正进行长江综合开发的流域规划。最近通车的亚洲最大的铁桥——武汉长江大桥，在重要材料和最先进技术上也得到了苏联的帮助。这许多巨大的、现代化的企业和工程的建设成功，一个个都是伟大的中苏友谊的结晶。
    为了帮助我国建设现代化的厂矿企业，几年来，苏联从它的紧张热烈的共产主义建设中抽调出数以千计的专家来到我国。具有高度国际主义精神的苏联专家，不辞劳苦地给予我国系统的技术援助。他们同时毫无保留地把先进的科学技术和丰富的工作经验教给我国技术人员和工人，使他们能够很快地掌握了新的生产技术，管理新的企业。从1953年到现在，苏联还接受了我国七千多名实习生到它的拥有先进技术装备的工厂中进行实习，使他们能够在很短的时期内掌握保证我国新建工厂及时开工生产的各种先进技术。
    我国开国以来，苏联曾经数度给予我国条件极为优惠的贷款援助，其总额折合人民币五十二亿九千四百万元，使我国能够从苏联获得大量的建设物资的供应，对于我国国民经济的恢复和发展起了重要作用。苏联给予我国贷款的各种优惠条件，是我国外债史上从未有过的，也是资本主义世界所不可能有的。经过几年来我国经济的巨
  大发展，现在我国已经更有条件依靠自己的积累
  来进行建设了。
      对外贸易是中苏两国经济合作的一个主要形
  式。自从1950年两国政府签订贸易协定以来，中
  苏贸易获得了迅速的、巨大的发展。今年我国对
  苏联的进出口贸易总额在我国对外贸易总额中约
  占50％，比1950年的中苏贸易额增长将近三倍。
  苏联供应我们的物资，都是我国恢复国民经济和实现社会主义工业化所必不可少的机器设备、工业器材、各种原料、科学仪器和人民日用必需品。在第一个五年计划期间，苏联供应各种金属切削机床约三千台、黑色金属二百多万吨、农业机械上万台、科学仪器总值约人民币一亿元。苏联还供应了我们相当数量的砂糖、棉花、布匹、纸张、医药等，有助于我国人民生活的不断提高。苏联供应我们的物资，不仅在时间上、数量上尽量满足我国需要，而且质量头等。我国供应苏联的物资，也是苏联发展国民经济和改善人民生活所必需的东西。中苏贸易不断发展，对于促进两国经济的高涨和人民生活的改善，特别是对于推进我国社会主义工业化，起着巨大作用。
    中苏贸易充分地体现了社会主义阵营经济合作的无比优越性。我们两国贸易是根据平等互利、需要与可能相结合和互助合作的原则来进行的。我们的贸易是在双方国民经济不断高涨的基础上有计划地巩固地发展，并且有着许多相互便利的共同条件。我们的贸易根本没有像资本主义世界市场那些由于经济危机、投机等因素而产生的价格暴涨暴落的现象，这就有利于双方的有计划的经济建设和贸易的发展。
    几年来的事实使人们清楚地看到：通过中苏贸易，苏联人民给了中国人民以重大的支援。而且由于中苏贸易的发展，美帝国主义对中国的所谓“禁运”已遭到彻底的失败。
    中苏科学技术合作的日益发展是两国经济合作更加密切的一个重要标志。1954年10月，中苏两国政府签订了科学技术合作协定。几年来，苏联不仅派遣了大批专家来帮助我国迅速提高科学技术水平、接受我国大批实习生去苏联学习先进
  技术；而且还大量供应了我国各种技术资料和接受了我国各种专家到苏联进行技术考察。从1954年以来，苏联已经供应我国的技术资料达三千多项，接受我国派遣的考察专家近七百人。苏联正积极地帮助我国发展和平利用原子能事业。苏联不仅大力帮助我国建立原子反应堆，并且在去年还同我国和其他社会主义国家共同成立了“联合核子研究所”。为了进一步促进我国科学技术的发展，苏联的科学研究机构同我国相应部门的直接联系大大地加强了。通过这种联系，双方将相互交换科学研究工作计划、科学技术情报、科学著作等，并且共同进行专题的科学研究工作。在科学技术合作中，我们也尽可能把我国有成就的某些科学技术介绍给苏联。从1954年以来，我国供应苏联所需要的工业、农业、交通运输业等方面的技术资料近三百项，接受了苏联二百多名专家来我国考察某些农作物种植、日用品制造、医药卫生等方面的技术经验。
    中苏两国的科学技术合作，对于我国解决生产建设中的技术问题，使最急需的部门更快地赶上世界先进科学技术水平，以及新技术的实际运用，都有着巨大意义。通过科学技术合作，苏联人民把从十月革命四十年以来在建设和科学研究中所达到的高度的科学技术成就贡献给同他们亲如兄弟的中国人民。苏联从各方面帮助我国培养我们自己的技术力量，将使我国能在最短期间获得技术上的完全独立。
    中苏两国经济合作还曾经或经常地采用举办各种展览会、相互派遣专业性代表团访问等形式。这些对于促进我国经济发展和两国人民的伟大友谊也起着显著作用。
    我国人民永远不会忘记十月革命胜利以来苏联人民在我国人民革命斗争的艰难岁月里所给予的极大鼓舞，永远不会忘记苏联人民在中国建设社会主义的艰苦奋斗中所给予我国的全面的、长期的、巨大的、无私的援助。中国人民从长期的革命和建设的实践中深刻地体会到，真正的友谊和援助只能是来自以苏联为首的社会主义国家和国际无产阶级。
    现在我国即将开始第二个五年计划建设。为了又多、又快、又好、又省地逐步地把我国建成一个伟大的社会主义工业国，为了争取世界持久和平，我们必须继续高举十月革命和无产阶级国际主义的旗帜，进一步加强中苏两国人民的友好团结，更好地、认真地、全心全意地向我们伟大的盟邦苏联学习，并且进一步有计划地巩固和发展两国间的经济合作。
