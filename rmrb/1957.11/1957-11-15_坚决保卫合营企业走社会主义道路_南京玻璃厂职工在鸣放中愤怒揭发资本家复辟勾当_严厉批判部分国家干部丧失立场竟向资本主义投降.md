Xinhua Daily Report: Workers of the Nanjing Glass Factory, a public-private joint venture, have revealed in the midst of the Great Blooming and Contending that unscrupulous capitalists, such as Hou Funan, recklessly colluded with the public-side factory director, some Party member cadres, and some workers to jointly establish "underground factories." These unscrupulous capitalists used the personnel, equipment, and production-supply-sales relationships of socialist enterprises to engage in their capitalist restoration conspiracy through the method of "joint public-private operation for private gain."

On September 26th, Cheng Dongming, a staff member of the Labor and Wages Section, posted a big-character poster titled "Who is Transforming Whom?", specifically exposing the inside story of the underground factory "Green Leaf Chemical Industry Cooperative." This big-character poster caused a sensation among the factory workers. Some unscrupulous capitalists, headed by Hou Funan (Production Section Chief of the Glass Factory) and Ding Zhengfu (General Affairs Section Chief), even dragged a group of cadres into the water. Among these cadres were Zhang Yudi, the public-side factory director with over ten years of Party membership; Liu Guangcheng, the Party member head of the Personnel Section; the Party member director of the Second Branch Factory; the chairman of the Second Branch Factory's trade union; a worker-出身 (chushen, i.e. of worker origins) staff member of the Supply and Sales Section; and Cheng Dongming himself. This underground factory began preparations in June of this year. They obtained the formula for preparing rubber sleeves by deceiving the Nanjing "May 1st" Production Cooperative and, utilizing the fact that "Green Leaf Cooperative" personnel were distributed in various departments of the Glass Factory, took advantage of the factory's need to develop supply and sales business to carry out the preparatory activities for "Green Leaf Cooperative." They seized the opportunity to connect with customers who came to the factory to order wine bottles, opening up the sales of "Green Leaf Cooperative's" product - rubber sleeves for the mouths of wine bottles. They occupied factory buildings to use as "Green Leaf Cooperative's" workshops; stole the factory's material bottles and other utensils to use as "Green Leaf Cooperative's" production tools. They signed an agreement stipulating that each participant would invest one hundred yuan, and after the business of "Green Leaf Cooperative" developed, the shares could be returned monthly. Just as this capitalist enterprise, organized by using a socialist enterprise as its base, was ready and about to start production, the factory launched the rectification campaign, and the inside story of "Green Leaf Cooperative" was exposed.

Following the revelation of this issue, a worker from the Second Branch Factory and some other employees revealed another case: another unscrupulous capitalist, Shu Zhigang, a staff member of the Supply and Sales Section, colluded with some other employees (including Party members) to open another underground factory, the "Nanjing Chemical Colloidal Products Production Group," on Hongwu Road. This production group had already started production as early as December last year. Initially, six people invested, which was once reduced to three; later, after reorganization, the number of participants expanded again to six. For more than half a year, the "production group" had obtained astonishing profits. In March and April of this year, when the group only had three people investing and producing, it had a turnover of 5,883 yuan in two months, with a profit of 1,093 yuan; at one point, the profit amount reached seven or eight times the share capital during the same period. The "production group's" exploitation of workers was very serious: the wages of newly hired temporary workers were paid at 65% of the wages of formal workers; "newcomers" (referring to those who had not done this work before) were required to be taught by "old hands," without pay, and allowed the "old hands" to "reward" them as much as they pleased. During the preparation of the "production group," Shu Zhigang took advantage of the fact that the "May 1st" Production Cooperative frequently ordered rubber molds from the Glass Factory to coerce the "May 1st" Cooperative into hiring his wife, Zhang Guiying, as a temporary worker. As soon as Zhang Guiying arrived at the "May 1st" Cooperative, she probed the sales channels and prices of product rubber sleeves in many ways, and went home in the evening to conduct trial production with Shu. Soon, Shu used the excuse to recall Zhang Guiying and pulled away two temporary workers from the "May 1st" Cooperative to formally run this "production group" on his own. After the "production group" produced in large quantities, Shu also openly poached the sales channels of the "May 1st" Cooperative and other production units, selling at reduced prices to compete with them in the market.

After the "underground factory" issue was exposed, it aroused great indignation among the workers. Next to the big-character posters exposing the inside story of the "underground factory," big-character posters such as "It is shameful to take the capitalist road!" and "What are the intentions of opening underground factories?" appeared continuously. Some even used cartoons to depict the despicable images of Zhang Yudi willingly following unscrupulous capitalists and Hou Funan corrupting cadres. The workers held six consecutive "democratic forums" to analyze the nature of these two cases and forcefully reprimanded Zhang Yudi, Hou Funan, and others. Worker Song Yuanzhe questioned Zhang Yudi, saying: "Are you leading the capitalists to engage in socialism, or are the capitalists leading you to engage in capitalism?" Workers Wang Jinfa questioned Zhang Yudi and Liu Guangcheng: "What did you make revolution for? Was it to eliminate private ownership or to develop private ownership? You have now been transformed by the capitalists and have completely betrayed the Party!" The workers felt particularly saddened by the fact that some Party member cadres had been hit by the capitalists' sugar-coated bullets; many Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members expressed their determination to fight to the death to thoroughly defeat capitalism.

The workers also revealed the illegal activities of unscrupulous capitalists such as Hou Funan, Ding Zhengfu, and Shu Zhigang, whose erosion of the socialist enterprise in terms of organization and ideology had reached a serious degree. The Communist Party members Zhang Yudi and Liu Guangcheng, who had been "dragged into the water," had been completely captured by the capitalists, their thinking had degenerated, and they obediently allowed Hou Funan and others to manipulate them. Hou Funan and others' rampant attacks had also weakened the fighting role of the factory's Party organization to a certain extent. Among the seven members of the Party's general branch, in addition to two (namely Zhang Yudi and Liu Guangcheng) who participated in the underground factory, there was also a member who knew about their activities but did not interfere; some members had heard about Shu Zhigang's illegal behavior but did not realize the seriousness of the problem's nature, let alone report it to the higher Party committee. A small number of workers, including individual Party members, unconsciously embarked on the capitalist road. For example, one worker produced in the factory during the day and went to work for the underground factory at night; one worker even left his production post and was absent from work to do Mao bamboo business; there were also workers who ran单帮(danbang, independent peddlers) and opened "black shops" (shops opened without approval), and so on.

The illegal activities of unscrupulous capitalists and others also brought serious consequences to the enterprise's production. Zhang Yudi was enthusiastic about following the capitalists on the capitalist road and had completely abandoned his leadership of the socialist enterprise. When he discovered problems in production, he did not actively try to solve them. Hou Funan, as the head of the Production Section, only knew how to work for the trial production of "Green Leaf Cooperative" products but did not ask about production problems within the factory. For example, the rubber rolling machine in the rubber group often had accidents and frequently stopped working, and the scrap rate was often around 40%, so that the output of rubber pads was not sufficient to meet the needs of water bottle production. The masses also revealed that, under the circumstances that cadres such as Zhang Yudi had been captured by the enemy, the Nanjing Glass Factory had, for a period of time, adopted a capitalist set of methods in business management: in production, pursuing output and profit, regardless of quality; in industrial and commercial relations and factory cooperation, only considering its own profit, regardless of market needs and the production needs of cooperative factories; in terms of employee benefits, knowing that there were problems, but ignoring them; in terms of working conditions, some that could be improved were not improved.

After this period of workers' exposure and preliminary criticism of the underground factory issue, a small number of workers who originally had vague understandings were greatly shaken. One worker, who originally secretly manufactured rubber molds for sale, realized that this was taking the capitalist road after the "Green Leaf Cooperative" and other issues were exposed, and has now stopped doing it. Some workers reflected that if there had not been this rectification campaign and the issues had not been exposed, the consequences would have been unimaginable. Currently, workers are engaging in debates with these illegal elements who are attacking socialism and attempting to restore capitalism, further exposing and criticizing them.

    坚决保卫合营企业走社会主义道路
    南京玻璃厂职工在鸣放中愤怒揭发资本家复辟勾当
    严厉批判部分国家干部丧失立场竟向资本主义投降
    本报讯　据新华日报报道：公私合营南京玻璃厂职工在大鸣大放中揭发出后抚南等不法资本家肆无忌惮地拉拢公方厂长、若干党员干部和一些工人合伙筹办“地下工厂”，这些不法资本家利用了社会主义企业的人员、设备和产供销关系，以“合公营私”的手法，来从事其资本主义复辟的勾当。
    9月26日，劳动工资科科员程东明贴出一张以“谁改造谁？”为题，具体揭发地下工厂“绿叶化学工业社”内幕的大字报。这张大字报轰动了全厂职工。后抚南（玻璃厂生产科长）、丁正固（总务科长）为首的一些不法资本家，竟把一批干部拉下了水。在这些干部中：有十多年党龄的公方厂长张玉棣，有身为人事科长的党员刘广成；还有二分厂的党员厂长、二分厂的工会主席、工人出身的供销科科员，以及程东明本人等。这地下工厂是今年6月份开始筹办的。他们向南京市“五一”生产合作社骗取到了配制胶皮套的料方，又利用
  “绿叶社”人员分布在玻璃厂各个科室的条件，借厂方需要发展供销业务的便利，开展“绿叶社”的筹办活动。他们抓住机会，和来厂里订购酒瓶的客户挂钩，打开“绿叶社”产品——套酒瓶口上的胶皮套的销路。他们占用厂房，做“绿叶社”的工场；盗窃厂里料瓶等器具，作为“绿叶社”的生产工具。他们签订了协议书，规定参加人员每人投资一百元，在“绿叶社”业务发展后，股金即可逐月抽还。正当这个利用社会主义企业为基地而组织起来的资本主义企业已筹备就绪、将要开工生产时，工厂开展了整风，“绿叶社”的内幕被揭发了出来。
    紧接着这问题的揭发，二分厂的一个工人和其他有些职工，又揭发出另一个案件：另一不法资本家、供销科科员舒志刚拉拢了另一些职工（其中有党员），在洪武路开设了另一家地下工厂“南京化学胶质用品生产组”。这生产组早在去年12月份就已开工生产，开始有六个人投资，一度减为三人；后又经过改组，参加人员重又扩展到六人之多。半年多来，“生产组”已获惊人暴利。今年三、四月份，当这个组只有三个人投资生产时，两个月就营业了五千八百八十三元，利润占一千零九十三元；有个时期的利润额达到同期股金的七、八倍。“生产组”对工人剥削程度很严重：刚雇用的临时工工资按正式工人工资的六五折发给；“新手”（指没有干过这活的）规定交“老手”带，不发工资，听任“老手”高兴“赏”给多少就拿多少。在筹办“生产组”时，舒志刚利用“五一”生产社经常向玻璃厂订购胶皮模子的条件，要挟“五一”社吸收其爱人张桂英为临时工。张桂英一到“五一”社，就多方刺探产品胶皮套销路和价格，晚上就回家和舒一起进行试制。不久，舒就借口召回张桂英，并拉走了“五一”社两个临时工，正式自办了这个“生产组”。当“生产组”大批生产后，舒还公然挖“五一”社等生产单位的销路，削价销售，与之争夺市场。
      “地下工厂”问题揭露后，激起职工群众很大愤慨。在揭发“地下工厂”内幕的大字报旁边，不断出现了“走资本主义道路可耻！”“开地下工厂居心何在？”等等大字报。有些还通过漫画勾划出了张玉棣甘心跟着不法资本家跑和后抚南等腐蚀干部的种种卑鄙形象。职工们连续举行了六次“民主讲坛”，分析这两个案件的性质，对张玉棣、后抚南等人进行了有力的斥责。工人宋元哲责问张玉棣说：“是你领导资本家搞社会主义，还是资本家领导你搞资本主义？”工人王金发向张玉棣、刘广成提出质询：“你们革命为了什么？是为了消灭私有制，还是发展私有制？你们现在已给资本家改造了去了，已完全背叛了党！”工人们为某些党员干部给资本家糖衣炮弹打中，特别感到痛心；许多共产党员、共青团员都表示要为彻底战胜资本主义而作殊死斗争。
    职工们还揭发了不法资本家后抚南、丁正固、舒志刚等人的不法行动，对社会主义企业组织上、思想上的侵蚀，已达到严重的程度。被“拉下水”的共产党员张玉棣、刘广成等人已经完全为资本家所俘虏，思想上堕落蜕化，束手听任后抚南等人的摆布。后抚南等人的猖狂进攻，在一定程度上也已削弱了该厂党组织的战斗作用，党总支七个委员中，除二个（即张玉棣、刘广成）参加了地下工厂外，还有个委员明知他们的活动而不加干涉；有些委员曾风闻舒志刚的违法行为，但并没有警觉问题性质的严重，更没有向上级党委汇报。少数职工包括个别党员，不自觉地走上了资本主义道路。如有个工人白天在厂里生产，晚上去为地下工厂干活；有个工人竟离开了生产岗位，旷了工去做毛竹生意；还有工人去跑单帮、开“黑店”
  （不经批准而开业的商店）等等。
    不法资本家等的不法活动，也给企业生产带来了严重恶果。张玉棣热衷于追随资本家走资本主义道路，已完全放弃了对社会主义企业的领导，发现了生产中的问题，不积极想办法解决。后抚南身为生产科长，只知道为“绿叶社”产品试制而奔波，对厂内的生产问题却不加闻问。例如，橡胶组轧胶车老出事故，经常停工，废品率常在40％上下，以致胶皮垫子产量不敷供应水瓶生产需要。群众还揭发，在张玉棣等干部给敌人做了俘虏的情况下，南京玻璃厂有一个时期在经营管理上已袭用了资本主义一套方式：生产上追求产量、利润，不问质量；工商关系和厂厂协作问题上，只顾本身获利，不顾市场需要和协作厂的生产需要；职工福利方面，明知有问题，却置之不理；劳动条件方面，有些可以改善的也不去改善。
    经过这一时期职工们对地下工厂问题的揭发和初步批判，少数原来认识模糊的职工震动很大。有个工人原来在私自制造胶皮模子出售，“绿叶社”等问题揭发后，认识到这是走资本主义道路，现已停止不干。有些工人反映：如果没有这次整风，不把问题揭露出来，那后果真将不堪设想了。目前职工们正在和这些向社会主义进攻、妄图复辟资本主义的不法分子展开辩论，进一步揭露和批判他们。
