    The Light of the October Revolution Illuminates the Path to Victory for the Chinese People
    Xiong Fu
    (III)
    Lenin taught us that in order to defeat capitalism, the proletariat must have a party to act as its vanguard, a party composed of conscious and loyal communists educated and nurtured by arduous revolutionary struggles, able to link itself with the entire life of its own class and, through that class, with the entire mass of the exploited, and able to win the full trust of its own class and all working people. Comrade Mao Zedong has also often taught us that in our country, without a Leninist revolutionary party built according to Marxist-Leninist theory and style, it would be impossible to lead the working class and the broad masses of the people to victory over imperialism and its running dogs, and of course, even less possible to achieve socialist victory. He taught that "In the hundred years since the emergence of Marxism, it was only when the Russian Bolsheviks led the October Revolution, led socialist construction, and defeated fascist aggression that new-style revolutionary parties were established and developed on a global scale. Since the emergence of such revolutionary parties, the face of the world revolution has changed... The Chinese Communist Party is a party established and developed according to the example of the Soviet Communist Party. Since the emergence of the Chinese Communist Party, the face of the Chinese revolution has been completely renewed." Building a working-class party based on Marxist-Leninist theory and style is precisely the most concentrated, clearest, and most prominent manifestation of the great tradition of the October Revolution in China.
    Now, within our Party, there are some rightists who, starting from revisionism, echo the clamor of bourgeois rightists in society against the leadership of the Party, thinking that socialism can be built without the leadership of the Party. It must be understood that socialism is not a pill that can be taken by any class or any party. Socialism is the elimination of classes, the elimination of exploitation, and the elimination of the social roots of the phenomenon of man exploiting man. It can only be the result of the proletariat, under the leadership of the Communist Party, uniting all working people to defeat the bourgeoisie and capitalism. All socialist countries in the world are led by the Communist Party, and all genuine socialist movements are also led by the Communist Parties of various countries; conversely, all bourgeois parties and bourgeois governments are opposed to socialism, and those Second International parties that verbally embrace socialism have never implemented socialism when they were in power. This iron fact proves that without the leadership of the Communist Party, there would be no victory for the proletariat, no proletarian dictatorship, and no socialism. We must continue to maintain this great tradition of the October Revolution and consolidate the leadership of the Party in all aspects of our country.
    Lenin also taught us that "Without revolutionary theory, there can be no revolutionary movement," and that "Only a party guided by advanced theory can realize the role of advanced fighters." Comrade Mao Zedong also often taught us that in order for our Party to realize a series of great historical tasks, and to lead the Chinese people from one victory to another, the first thing to do is to form Marxist-Leninist unity within the Party, raise the Marxist-Leninist level of the whole Party, and consolidate the ideological and political leadership of Marxism-Leninism. He pointed out that Marxism-Leninism is a universally applicable truth, and the whole Party should learn Marxism-Leninism as a revolutionary science and a guide to action. "The great power of Marxism-Leninism lies in its connection with the specific revolutionary practice of various countries. For the Chinese Communist Party, it means learning to apply the theory of Marxism-Leninism to the specific environment of China." Insisting on Marxist-Leninist unity within its own ranks, adhering to the ideological principle of closely combining the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of the revolution in its own country, is another of the most concentrated, clearest, and most prominent manifestations of the great tradition of the October Revolution in China.
    Now, within our Party, there are also some rightists who, starting from revisionism, echo the clamor of bourgeois rightists in society against Marxism-Leninism, using the pretext of opposing dogmatism to oppose Marxism-Leninism. They regard Marxism-Leninism as something outdated, which is complete nonsense. However, Marxism-Leninism is a guide to action, it is not stagnant or unchanging, it itself is developing. The experience of the revolutionary movement in each country and the experience of transitioning to socialism will contribute to Marxism-Leninism, enriching and replenishing its treasury. It is wrong to regard Marxism-Leninism as immutable, to apply individual words and phrases in Marxist-Leninist books as dogma without considering whether these words and phrases are suitable for the objective reality of the revolution in one's own country and the objective needs of the people of one's own country. This is a dogmatic attitude towards Marxism-Leninism. However, if, in opposing dogmatism, one goes to the other extreme, completely abandoning the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism, completely denying the universal significance of the basic experience of the October Revolution and Soviet construction, and one-sidedly emphasizing the national characteristics of one's own country to an absurd degree, this is also wrong. This is a revisionist attitude towards Marxism-Leninism. Neither of these is permitted by Marxism-Leninism, but is opposed by Marxism-Leninism. In the current struggle, we should pay particular attention to opposing revisionist tendencies.
    Lenin also taught us that in order to oppose the international union of the bourgeoisie, the proletariats of all countries must also carry out their own international union, and the revolutionary actions of the proletariat in each country must develop and promote the general movement of the international proletarian revolution to the greatest extent possible. Comrade Mao Zedong also taught us that "In this world, all imperialists are our enemies, and China cannot achieve independence without the assistance of socialist countries and the international proletariat." When leading the working class and all other working people in our country in the struggle for revolution and construction, we must unite with the international revolutionary forces, first and foremost with the socialist camp centered on the Soviet Union. The Central Committee of our Party also emphasized in its political report to the Eighth National Congress of the Party that consolidating and strengthening our country's unity with the great Soviet Union and other socialist countries is our highest international obligation. Combining patriotism and internationalism in our own ranks, and taking proletarian internationalism as the criterion for our behavior in the international communist movement, is precisely the most concentrated, clearest, and most prominent manifestation of the great tradition of the October Revolution in China.
    However, there are also some rightists within our Party who, starting from bourgeois nationalism, echo the reactionary remarks of bourgeois rightists in society who oppose our "leaning to one side" towards the socialist camp, pitting patriotism against internationalism, pitting the national interests of our country against the overall interests of the international proletarian revolutionary movement, and blurring the line between the enemies and friends of our people in the international arena. We must adhere to proletarian internationalism and oppose surrendering to bourgeois nationalism.
    The cause of establishing the dictatorship of the proletariat and building socialism, initiated by the October Revolution, has always been the common cause of the international proletariat, and no differences or boundaries between any country or nation can diminish our responsibility for this common cause. The Soviet Union becoming the center of the international proletarian communist movement is precisely the greatest historical achievement of the October Revolution. It is the first socialist country, the first to reach the stage of transition to communism, the most experienced, and the most powerful. Only it can give the most significant assistance to the liberation cause of the proletariat and all oppressed nations in all countries, and only by relying on the strong forces of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union can the people of the world defend the cause of peace and prevent the outbreak of a third world war. What imperialism fears most is this unity of our socialist countries and the international proletariat of socialism. In order to achieve the goal of destroying the communist cause, they always try every means to undermine this unity, and with a great enemy in front of us, firmly safeguarding this unity is precisely the most urgent task of the revolutionary parties of the proletariat in all countries. For us proletarian revolutionaries, patriotism and internationalism are consistent. Internationalism refers to the unity and cooperation of the proletariats of all countries in the revolutionary struggle, and patriotism refers to the most complete reflection and representation of the interests of the people of their own nation by the proletariats of all countries in the revolutionary struggle, and uniting international revolutionary forces to fight against the common enemy—imperialism—is precisely the greatest and most fundamental interest of the people of all countries. Continuing to maintain this great tradition of the October Revolution and strengthening the internationalist unity of the proletariat centered on the Soviet Union is precisely the international obligation that we Chinese communists believe we should fulfill.

    十月革命的光芒照耀着中国人民的胜利的道路

    列宁教导我们说，为要战胜资本主义，无产阶级就要有一个充当自己的先锋队的党，这个党要由那些为顽强的革命斗争所教育和培养出来的有觉悟的和忠诚的共产主义者所组成，要能够把自己同本阶级的全部生活联系起来而又能通过本阶级同被剥削的整个群众联系起来，要能够获得本阶级和一切劳动群众的充分信任。毛泽东同志也经常教导我们说，在我国，没有一个按照马克思列宁主义理论和风格建立起来的列宁式的革命政党，就不可能领导工人阶级和广大人民群众取得战胜帝国主义及其走狗的胜利，当然更不可能有社会主义的胜利。他教导说，“自从马克思主义产生以来的一百多年的时间内，只是在有了俄国布尔什维克领导十月革命、领导社会主义建设和战胜法西斯侵略的榜样的时候，才在世界范围内建立了和发展了新式的革命党。自从有了这样的革命党，世界革命的面目就起了变化了。……中国共产党就是依照苏联共产党的榜样建立起来和发展起来的一个党。自从有了中国共产党，中国革命的面目就焕然一新了。”根据马克思列宁主义的理论和风格而建设起来一个工人阶级的政党，这正是十月革命的伟大传统在中国的最集中最鲜明最突出的表现。
    现在，在我们党内，有一些右派分子，他们从修正主义出发，附和社会上资产阶级右派反对党的领导的叫嚣，以为不要党的领导就可以建设社会主义。必须知道社会主义不是任何阶级和任何政党都可以服用的药丸。社会主义就是消灭阶级，消灭剥削，消灭人剥削人现象的社会根源。它只能是无产阶级在共产党领导之下联合一切劳动人民战胜资产阶级和资本主义才能获致的成果。全世界一切社会主义国家都是由共产党领导的，一切真正的社会主义运动也都是由各国共产党领导的；而与此相反，一切资产阶级政党和资产阶级政府都是反对社会主义的，那些在口头上也挂上社会主义的第二国际政党在他们执政的时候也从来没有实行过社会主义。正是这个铁一般的事实证明，没有共产党的领导，就不会有无产阶级的胜利，不会有无产阶级专政，不会有社会主义。我们必须继续保持十月革命的这个伟大传统，在我们国家的一切方面巩固党的领导。
    列宁也教导我们说：“没有革命的理论，就不会有革命的运动”，“只有受先进理论指导的党，才能实现先进战士的作用”。毛泽东同志也经常教导我们说，我们党要能够实现一系列伟大的历史任务，要能够把中国人民从一个胜利引导到又一个胜利，首先就要在党内形成马克思列宁主义的统一，提高全党的马克思列宁主义的水平，巩固马克思列宁主义的思想和政治的领导。他指出，马克思列宁主义是放之四海而皆准的理论，全党都应当把马克思列宁主义当做革命的科学和行动的指南来学习。“马克思列宁主义的伟大力量，就在于它是和各个国家具体的革命实践相联系的。对于中国共产党说来，就是要学会把马克思列宁主义的理论应用于中国的具体的环境，”在自己的队伍中坚持马克思列宁主义的统一，坚持马克思列宁主义的普遍真理和本国革命的具体实践密切结合的思想原则，这也正是十月革命的伟大传统在中国的最集中最鲜明最突出的另一个表现。
    现在，在我们党内，也有一些右派分子，他们从修正主义出发，附和社会上资产阶级右派反对马克思列宁主义的叫嚣，借口反对教条主义来反对马克思列宁主义。他们把马克思列宁主义看做过时了的东西，这完全是睁着眼睛说瞎话。然，马克思列宁主义是行动的指南，它不是停滞不前、一成不变的，它本身是发展的。每个国家的革命运动的经验和过渡到社会主义的经验都会对马克思列宁主义作出贡献而使它的宝库丰富和充实起来。把马克思列宁主义看成是不变的，把马克思列宁主义书本上的个别词句当做教条来应用而毫不考虑这些词句是否适合本国革命的客观实际和本国人民的客观需要，这是错误的。这就是对于马克思列宁主义的教条主义态度。但是，如果在反对教条主义的时候走到另一个极端，根本背弃马克思列宁主义的普遍真理，根本否认十月革命和苏联建设的基本经验的普遍意义，把本国的民族特点片面地强调到荒谬的程度，这也是错误的。这就是对于马克思列宁主义的修正主义态度。这两者都不是马克思列宁主义所容许的，而是马克思列宁主义所反对的。在当前斗争中，我们应当特别注意反对修正主义的倾向。
    列宁还教导我们说，为了反对资产阶级的国际联合，各国的无产阶级也要实行自己的国际联合，每个国家无产阶级在本国的革命行动都要最大限度地发展和推动国际无产阶级革命的总运动。毛泽东同志也教导我们说：“这个世界上，所有帝国主义都是我们的敌人，中国要独立，决不能离开社会主义国家和国际无产阶级的援助。”在领导本国工人阶级和其他一切劳动人民进行革命和建设的斗争的时候，我们必须同国际革命力量团结一致，首先是同以苏联为中心的社会主义阵营团结一致。我们党的中央委员会向党的第八次全国代表大会的政治报告中也强调指出，巩固和加强我国同伟大的苏联和其他社会主义国家的团结是我们最高的国际义务。在自己的队伍中把爱国主义和国际主义结合起来，把无产阶级国际主义当做自己在国际共产主义运动中的行为的准则，这也正是十月革命的伟大传统在中国的最集中最鲜明最突出的表现。
    可是，在我们党内也有一些右派分子，从资产阶级民族主义出发，同社会上资产阶级右派反对我们向社会主义阵营
  “一边倒”的反动言论相呼应，把爱国主义同国际主义对立起来，把本国的民族利益同国际无产阶级革命运动的总的利益对立起来，把我国人民在国际上的敌人和朋友的界限混淆起来。我们必须坚持无产阶级国际主义，反对向资产阶级民族主义投降。
    十月革命所创始的建立无产阶级专政和建设社会主义的事业，从来就是国际无产阶级的共同事业，任何国家和民族之间的各种差别和界限都不能减轻我们对于这个共同事业的责任。苏联成为国际无产阶级共产主义运动的中心，这正是十月革命最伟大的历史成果。它是第一个社会主义国家，最先走到向共产主义过渡的发展阶段，经验最丰富，国力最强大，只有它能够给予各国无产阶级和一切被压迫民族的解放事业以最重大的援助，也只有依靠以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的强大力量，世界人民才能够保卫住和平事业而阻止第三次世界大战的发生。帝国主义最害怕的就是我们社会主义的国家和社会主义的国际无产阶级的这种团结，他们为了达到毁灭共产主义事业的目的，总是千方百计要来破坏我们这种团结，而大敌当前，坚定地维护这种团结正是各国无产阶级革命派最迫切的任务。对于我们无产阶级革命派说来，爱国主义和国际主义是一致的。国际主义所指的是各国无产阶级在革命斗争中的团结和合作，爱国主义所指的是各国无产阶级在革命斗争中最充分地反映和代表本民族人民的利益，而联合国际革命力量来对共同的敌人——帝国主义进行斗争正是各国人民最大的最根本的利益。继续保持十月革命的这个伟大传统，加强以苏联为中心的无产阶级的国际主义团结，这也正是我们中国共产党人所认为自己应尽的国际义务。（续完）
