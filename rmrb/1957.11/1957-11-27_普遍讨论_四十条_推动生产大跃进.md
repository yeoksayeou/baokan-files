    Widespread Discussion of the "Forty Articles" Promotes the Great Leap Forward in Production

    Fujian Mountain Areas Widely Discuss the Forty Articles
    In early November, after the Nanping Special District of Fujian Province universally convened county committee enlarged meetings to implement the resolutions of the Eighth Central Committee's Third Plenary Session, the entire district immediately launched a high tide of publicizing the Forty Articles for Agriculture. In addition to organizing propaganda teams to go up the mountains and down to the fields to publicize the great significance of the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) to mountain farmers, various places also used blackboards, wall newspapers, light newspapers, and broadcasting tubes for publicity. According to incomplete statistics from ten counties including Pucheng, Gutian, Jian'ou, and Youxi, more than 20,000 wall newspapers and more than 5,000 blackboards related to the publicity of the Forty Articles were posted. In addition, the wired broadcasting stations in fifteen counties across the district also arranged radio programs related to the publicity of the Forty Articles every day starting from November 10.
    At the same time, more than 900 townships across the district have also recently convened old farmers' associations, women's associations, youth associations, and small-scale symposiums based on production teams or natural villages, with the main content of publicizing the Forty Articles, reading and explaining the key points item by item.
    Many agricultural cooperatives, through the discussion of the Forty Articles, have formulated and revised their production plans for the coming year in accordance with local conditions. More than 150 agricultural cooperatives in Pucheng, Youxi and other counties have revised their production plans for the coming year. After the Zhangyuan Township of Pucheng County revised its production plan for the coming year, the double-cropping rice planting area expanded from the original plan of 1,800 mu to more than 4,300 mu.

    Discuss While Planning, While Acting
    Currently, more than 50% of agricultural cooperatives in Jinzhou Special District, Liaoning Province, are enthusiastically studying and discussing the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft). Fifty-six cooperatives in Jianping County have revised their winter production plans through discussion and formulated simple long-term development production plans. The Propaganda Department of the CPC Zhangwu County Committee distributed the Forty Articles to each of the more than 1,000 production teams in 190 cooperatives in the county; and dispatched 17 working groups to go deep into the townships, cooperatives, and teams to organize members to discuss in conjunction with the central work. Now, each production team has generally studied and discussed more than twice, and 91 cooperatives have formulated and revised production plans for each season after discussion, and 17 cooperatives have formulated long-term production plans.
    The cooperatives in various places, through the method of discussing, planning, and acting at the same time, have greatly overcome conservative ideas and set off a new upsurge in agricultural production. In order to realize the provisions of the Forty Articles ahead of schedule, cooperatives throughout the special district are actively stepping up the repair of farmland water conservancy and vigorously accumulating fertilizer.

    As Long as You Grasp Two Treasures, You Can Achieve the Forty Articles
    The CPC Pingyao County Committee of Shanxi Province convened a meeting of activists marching towards nature from November 1st to 8th. At the meeting, taking the Forty Articles of the National Agricultural Development Program as a guide, the method of great debate was used to solve ideological problems and other specific problems in production. During the discussion, most people said with excitement that they had the confidence to achieve the targets stipulated in the program, but a few people lacked confidence. Hu Tianming, the secretary of the Beihou Village Cooperative branch, said: "The Forty Articles sound good, but they can't be done. People often say: if you don't plant 100 mu of land, you won't harvest 100 dan of grain. That's our place. There is no wasteland to be reclaimed, and there is nothing. How can we achieve the Forty Articles?" Hao Yufang, the secretary of the Liangjiapu Cooperative branch, first retorted: "Although it was dry this year, our cooperative's more than 100 mu of sorghum still produced 424 jin per mu, and 95 mu of cotton produced 30 jin of lint cotton per mu. This shows that the 'Forty Articles' can be achieved." He continued: "If you want crops to grow well, you must grasp two treasures: one treasure is water conservancy, and the other treasure is fertilizer. With these two treasures, how can you say that the Forty Articles sound good but cannot be done?" Guo Jinshan said: "Although I am already sixty years old, I will also work hard with you young people for another twelve years to ensure the completion of the tasks stipulated in the Forty Articles." Through the debate, everyone's thoughts were unified, and everyone had the confidence and determination to achieve the agricultural development program.
        (Wu Shude, Du Hong, Geng Wenming)

    Strive to Exceed the Target Next Year
    After the cadres and members of the Guowangdu Pioneer No. 1 Cooperative in Anyang County, Henan Province, went through the socialist great debate and distinguished between right and wrong on major issues, a new momentum has emerged in production. After the promulgation of the National Agricultural Development Program, the cooperative's Party branch immediately led all members to study and debate, and everyone's enthusiasm was even higher. At the debate, Shi Jingde, the leader of the third production team, said: "We have wells and canals. As long as the fertilizer can keep up, we are sure that we can produce 500 jin of wheat per mu and 400 jin of autumn grain and 100 jin of lint cotton." Member Li Fangxing said: "This year's wheat received 402 jin. It would not be less if next year's wheat can receive 420 jin. Five hundred jin is probably bragging." Member Wang Bao said: "The self-retained vegetable plots distributed to the members can receive 1,000 jin. Why can't the cooperative's wheat receive 500 jin? Things are done by people. As long as you are determined, you can receive it." After a heated debate, everyone unanimously expressed their determination to strive to produce 1,000 jin of grain and 120 jin of lint cotton per mu next year.
    Encouraged by the agricultural development program, the cooperative has set off a vigorous upsurge in accumulating fertilizer. From November 4 to now, the entire cooperative has cut more than 220,000 jin of grass. (Xu Mengchao, Li Fulin)

  Come on a Great Leap Forward
    The cadres and members of the Xianfeng Agricultural Cooperative in Ninggang County, Jiangxi Province, warmly support the contents stipulated in the program. When they discussed when the cooperative would complete the program's stipulation of producing 800 jin of grain per mu, Zhang Yutian, the director of the cooperative, said: "Our cooperative's grain output per mu was 290 jin in 1951, and it has increased to 439 jin in 1957. Judging from this development speed, it can be affirmed that as long as we have a vigor, we can quickly reach the requirements stipulated in the program." Member Gu Jinlong said: "Our Taqian No. 4 field harvested 500 jin of rice this year, which is equivalent to 1,200 jin per mu. Only by vigorously accumulating fertilizer, there is no problem in achieving 800 jin per mu." After discussion, all members unanimously agreed that they could achieve the requirement of 800 jin in 1960, and decided to immediately launch a winter production campaign to strive for a great leap forward next year, so that the output per mu would reach 700 jin. (Zhang Yutian)

    Criticize Conservative Ideas
    Strive for a Comprehensive Harvest
    At the four-level cadre meeting held by the CPC Tianjin Prefectural Committee from November 4th to 16th, many cadres enthusiastically discussed and studied the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft), and through great airing, great contending, and great debate, summarized the experience of the whole region in transforming low-lying areas in the past three years, and further tapped the potential for production.

    In the great airing and great contending, many right-leaning conservative ideas were exposed. They were concentrated in: In those areas with poor production conditions, such as wasteland and alkaline depressions, which have not yet undergone or have not implemented large-scale transformation of low-lying areas, they doubted the possibility of a great leap forward in production.

    After listing the facts to criticize conservative ideas, the participating cadres focused on analyzing and studying the local production conditions, and revised the original plans to be more advanced and reliable. According to the prefectural committee's plan, the total grain output of the region will be guaranteed to reach 2.5 billion jin by 1958. Baodi, Ninghe, Renqiu and other three counties will achieve the requirements of the program next year.

    普遍讨论“四十条”推动生产大跃进
    福建山区普遍讨论四十条
    11月上旬，福建南平专区各县普遍召开县委扩大会议贯彻党的八届三中全会决议后，全区立即掀起了宣传农业四十条纲要的热潮。各地除组织宣传队伍上山、下田向山区农民宣传全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）的重大意义外，还运用黑板报、墙报、灯报和广播筒等进行宣传。据浦城、古田、建瓯和尤溪等十个县不完全统计，共贴出有关宣传四十条纲要的墙报二万多张，黑板报五千多块。此外，全区有十五个县的有线广播站，从11月10日起，每天也安排了有关宣传四十条纲要的广播节目。
    与此同时，全区有九百多个乡最近还分别召开了以宣传四十条纲要为主要内容的老农会、妇女会、青年会和以生产队或自然村为单位的小型座谈会，逐条宣读重点讲解。
    许多农业社通过四十条纲要的讨论，都纷纷因地制宜制订和重新修订了明年的生产规划。浦城、尤溪等县有一百五十多个农业社重新修订了明年的生产规划。浦城县樟源乡重新修订明年的生产规划后，双季稻种植面积由原规划的一千八百亩，扩大到四千三百多亩。

    边讨论　边规划  边行动
    辽宁省锦州专区目前已有50％以上农业社正在热烈学习讨论全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）。建平县有五十六个社通过讨论修订了冬季生产规划，并制订了简单的长远发展生产规划。中共彰武县委宣传部给全县一百九十个社的一千多个生产队，每队都发了四十条纲要；并派出十七个工作组，结合中心工作深入乡、社、队组织社员讨论。现在各生产队一般都学习讨论了两次以上，有九十一个社经过讨论制订与修订了各季生产规划，十七个社订出了长远生产规划。
    各地合作社，通过边讨论、边规划、边行动的方法，大大克服了保守思想，掀起了农业生产新高潮。全专区合作社为提前实现四十条纲要的规定，正在积极加紧典修农田水利和大力积肥。（王德成）
    只要抓住两样宝  就能实现四十条
    中共山西平遥县委于11月1日至8日召开了向大自然进军的积极分子大会。会上以全国农业发展纲要四十条为指针，用大辩论的方法，解决思想问题和生产中其他具体问题。讨论中，多数人都欢欣鼓舞地表示有信心实现纲要规定指标，但还有少数人信心不足。北侯村社支书胡天明说：“四十条听起来好，就是办不到，人常说：不种百亩地，不打百担粮。就是咱们这地方，开荒没荒，要啥没啥，怎能达到四十条。”梁家堡社支书郝毓芳首先反驳说：“虽然今年天旱，但我们社的一百多亩高粱，每亩还产到四百二十四斤，九十五亩棉花每亩产到三十斤皮棉，这就说明‘四十条’是能实现的。”他接着说：“要想庄稼长的好，必须抓住两样宝，一宝是水利，一宝是肥料，有了这两样宝，怎么说四十条是听的好，办不到呢？”郭金山说：“我老汉虽然已经六十岁，也要和你们青年人一齐再奋斗十二年，保证实现四十条规定的任务”。通过争论，大家的思想一致了，都有信心有决心实现农业发展纲要。

    争取明年超过指标
    河南省安阳县郭王度先锋一社的干部和社员，经过社会主义大辩论，划清大是大非以后，在生产上出现了一股新的劲头。全国农业发展纲要公布后，该社党支部立即领导全体社员进行学习和辩论，大家的情绪更加高涨。在辩论会上，第三生产队长施景德说：“咱有井有渠，只要肥料能赶上，明年亩产小麦五百斤，秋粮四百斤，皮棉一百斤是有把握的”。社员李方兴说：“今年小麦收到四百零二斤，明年能收四百二十斤也就不少了，五百斤怕是吹牛”。社员王保说：“社员分的自留菜地能收一千斤，为啥社里麦子收不到五百斤？事是人干的，只要下决心，没有收不到的”。经过热烈的辩论，大家一致表示争取明年亩产千斤粮、一百二十斤皮棉。
    该社在农业发展纲要鼓舞下，已掀起了轰轰烈烈的积肥高潮。从11月4日到现在止，全社已割草二十二万多斤。（徐孟朝、李付林）
  来一个大跃进
    江西宁冈县先锋农业社的社干和社员热烈拥护纲要所规定的内容。他们在讨论本社在何时完成纲要规定每亩产粮食八百斤时，社主任张玉田说：“我们社1951年每亩粮食产量是二百九十斤，1957年已经提高到四百三十九斤，从这个发展速度来看，可以肯定，只要我们有一股劲，就可以迅速达到纲要规定的要求”，社员古金龙说：“我们塔前四分田今年收谷五百斤，每亩就合一千二百斤。只有大力积肥，达到每亩产八百斤是没有问题”，经过讨论后，全体社员一致认为能在1960年达到八百斤的要求，并且决定立即开展冬季生产运动，争取明年来一个大跃进，使每亩产量达到七百斤。（张玉田）
    批判保守思想
    争取全面丰收
    在中共天津地委11月4日到16日召开的四级干部会议上，许多干部热烈讨论和学习了全国农业发展纲要（修正草案），并通过大鸣大放大争，总结了三年来全区改造洼地的经验，进一步挖掘了生产潜力。
    大鸣大放中，暴露出不少右倾保守思想。集中表现在：在那些尚未进行或没有大面积实行洼地改造的荒碱洼地等生产条件不好的地区，怀疑生产大跃进的可能性。
    与会干部在列举事实批判了保守思想以后，着重分析研究了本地的生产条件，把原来的规划修订得更加先进可靠。按地委计划，全区到1958年粮食产量保证达到二十五亿斤。宝坻、宁河、任丘等三个县将在明年实现纲要要求。
