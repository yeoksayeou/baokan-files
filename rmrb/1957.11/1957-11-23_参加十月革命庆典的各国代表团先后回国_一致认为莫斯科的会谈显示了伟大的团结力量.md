Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 22nd - According to TASS, Moscow: The delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, headed by President Ho Chi Minh, which participated in the celebrations of the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution, left Moscow by plane on the evening of the 21st to return home. The people of Moscow warmly saw off President Ho Chi Minh.
	On the 21st, Khrushchev received President Ho Chi Minh and had a cordial and friendly conversation with him.
	On that day, President Ho Chi Minh held a press conference. He said at the conference that the arrival of delegations from the Communist and Workers' Parties of many countries in Moscow to participate in the celebrations of the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution was a noteworthy event. Before the war, there were only four million communists worldwide, but now there are thirty-three million communists. This is a huge force capable of defending peace and opposing war.
	Ho Chi Minh went on to say that the launching of two artificial Earth satellites by the Soviet Union proved the brilliant achievements that the Soviet people have achieved in scientific development under socialist conditions. He said, I believe that the Vietnamese people and the people of other countries can happily recognize that the Soviet people have taken the lead in conquering the universe, while the scientific achievements of the United States are lagging behind in this regard.
Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 22nd - According to TASS, Moscow: The delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, headed by Premier Kim Il-sung, left Moscow on the 21st to return home.
	The delegation was invited to participate in the celebrations of the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution.

	On the 21st, when the head of the delegation, Zhivkov, arrived in Sofia, he spoke at the airport. He first conveyed the most cordial fraternal greetings of the Communist Party, Government, and people of the Soviet Union to the Communist Party, Government, and people of Bulgaria, as well as their sincere wishes for Bulgaria to achieve new achievements in socialist construction.
	Regarding the meeting of representatives of the fraternal parties in Moscow to celebrate the October Revolution, he pointed out: The meeting demonstrated the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and the internationalist solidarity of the Communist and Workers' Parties of socialist countries. This unity is the greatest achievement of socialism. At the same time, the meeting also showed the organizational and ideological growth of the fraternal parties in capitalist countries and the great strength of the international communist and workers' movement.
	Zhivkov pointed out that the Bulgarian people, under the leadership of the Communist Party, will continue to use all their strength and wisdom to fight for the construction of socialism and the maintenance of peace in the Balkans and Europe. He said that more and more people are uniting under the banner of the October Revolution—the banner of communism, and the future belongs to communism.

    一致认为莫斯科的会谈显示了伟大的团结力量
    新华社22日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：以胡志明主席为首的参加十月革命四十周年庆祝典礼的越南民主共和国代表团，21日晚乘飞机离开莫斯科回国。莫斯科人热烈地欢送了胡志明主席。
    21日，赫鲁晓夫接见了胡志明主席，并且和他进行了亲切友好的谈话。
    在这一天，胡志明主席举行了记者招待会。他在招待会上说，许多国家的共产党和工人党代表团到莫斯科来参加十月革命四十周年庆祝典礼，这是一桩值得注意的事件。战前全世界只有四百万共产党员，可是现在已经有三千三百万共产党员了。这是一支能够捍卫和平、反对战争的巨大力量。
    胡志明接着说，苏联发射两颗人造地球卫星的事件证明，在社会主义条件下，苏联人民在科学发展方面获得了多么辉煌的成就。他说，我相信，越南人民和其他各国人民都能幸福地认识到，苏联人民在征服宇宙方面已经领了先，而美国的科学成就在这方面却落后了。
    新华社22日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：以金日成首相为首的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表团21日离开莫斯科回国。
    代表团是应邀前来参加十月革命四十周年庆祝典礼的。

    21日，代表团团长日夫科夫到达索非亚时在机场上讲了话。他首先转达了苏联共产党、政府和人民对保加利亚共产党、政府和人民最亲切的兄弟般的敬意，以及他们预祝保加利亚在社会主义建设方面取得新成就的真诚愿望。
    关于参加十月革命节庆典的各兄弟党代表在莫斯科的会见，他指出：会见显示了以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结和社会主义各国共产党和工人党的国际主义团结。这种团结一致是社会主义的最伟大的成果。同时，会见还显示了资本主义国家各兄弟党组织上、思想上的成长和国际共产主义和工人运动的伟大力量。
    日夫科夫指出，保加利亚人民在共产党的领导下，将继续用全部力量和智慧为建设社会主义、维护巴尔干和欧洲和平而斗争。他说，团结在十月革命的旗帜——共产主义的旗帜下的人们越来越多了，未来是属于共产主义的。
