Xinhua News Agency, November 22nd Dispatch from New York (TASS): Some American newspapers, commenting on the North Atlantic Group Council meeting to be held in Paris in December, point out that there is currently a crisis of distrust in American "leadership" within the group.

The "New York Herald Tribune" commentator Lippmann believes that the North Atlantic Group is currently facing a "crisis of confidence." He argues that this crisis was exposed after the Soviet Union achieved world-shaking scientific and technological achievements. However, this crisis existed from the very beginning of the North Atlantic Group's establishment because there have been and still are "internal conflicts" between the member states. They cannot "take a unified position on all important international issues." He particularly doubts whether these countries can "pursue a common policy in Asia and Africa." Lippmann believes that the "internal conflicts" within the North Atlantic Group, due to the inability to reach an agreement on common policies, will cause the group to "gradually collapse."

"New York Herald Tribune" reporter Alsop believes that "from a political point of view," the launch of the Soviet artificial satellite was "an undeniable and heavy blow" to the United States because this event "unambiguously exposed the balance of power," "showing us, and the world, our true situation. We (the United States) can no longer believe in the myth of ‘American leadership’… The world will no longer believe in this ‘American leadership.’"

Due to the crisis within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, American monopoly organizations' newspapers are increasingly talking about the need to reorganize this military group. Newspaper reports indicate that the purpose of the American reorganization plan is to make the North Atlantic Treaty Organization further subordinate to American aggression purposes, even to deprive the organization of the right to decide on war issues. Commentator Drew Pearson wrote quite bluntly in the "Daily Mirror": "Dulles and Eisenhower must persuade the small countries of Europe that Anglo-Saxon countries have the right (giving Britain a little face) to decide when Europe goes to war and when it does not."

However, as the "New York Times" correspondent in London, Middleton, pointed out: in Britain and continental Europe, there are increasing signs that the United States and its "allies" will have "conflicts" on major political issues such as the recently revealed reorganization of the North Atlantic Group.

Commenting on US Secretary of Defense McElroy's statement that the United States intends to establish medium-range missile bases abroad, Middleton wrote that a "experienced diplomat" in London believes that unless the United States "largely abandons its right to decide on the use of missiles," Western European countries are unwilling to provide missile bases. He also pointed out that Europeans would raise the question: Can relying on the United States truly guarantee security and compensate for the sacrifices brought about by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization?

### 北大西洋集团内部冲突激化  美国“领导”威信一落千丈美国记者纷纷发出悲鸣

    北大西洋集团内部冲突激化
    美国“领导”威信一落千丈
    美国记者纷纷发出悲鸣
    新华社22日讯　据塔斯社纽约21日讯：一些美国报纸在评论12月将在巴黎举行的北大西洋集团理事会会议的时候指出，目前这个集团内部存在着不信任美国“领导”的危机。
    “纽约先驱论坛报”评论员李普曼认为，目前北大西洋集团内部正面临着一种“信任危机”。他认为，这种危机在苏联取得了轰动世界的科学技术成就之后暴露了出来。但是，这种危机是早在北大西洋集团成立之初就已经存在的，因为这个集团的成员国之间过去和现在都存在着“内部冲突”，它们不能“在一切重要的国际问题方面采取一致的立场”。他特别怀疑这些国家能否“在亚洲和非洲奉行共同的政策”。李普曼认为，由于不能就共同政策达成协议，北大西洋集团的“内部冲突”会使得这个集团“逐渐地垮台”。
    “纽约先驱论坛报”记者艾尔索普认为，“从政治观点来看”，苏联人造卫星的发射对于美国是“一个无可争辩的沉重打击”，因为这件事“毫不含糊地暴露了力量的对比”，“向我们，也向全世界表明了我们的真正处境。我们（美国）再也不能相信‘美国领导’的神话了……全世界再也不会相信这个‘美国领导’了。”
    由于北大西洋公约组织的危机，美国垄断组织的报纸越来越多地谈论必须改组这个军事集团。报纸的消息表明，美国的改组计划的目的是企图使北大西洋公约组织进一步屈从美国的侵略目的，甚至要剥夺这个组织决定战争问题的权利。评论员德鲁·皮尔逊在“每日镜报”上十分露骨地写道：“杜勒斯和艾森豪威尔必须说服欧洲的小国，盎格鲁撒克逊国家有权（给英国的一点小面子）决定欧洲何时进行战争何时不进行战争的问题。”
    但是，正像“纽约时报”驻伦敦记者密德尔顿所指出：在英国和欧洲大陆，有越来越多的迹象表明，美国和它的“盟国”在像最近透露的改组北大西洋集团这样一些重大的政治问题上将发生“冲突”。
    在评论美国国防部长麦克艾罗伊关于美国打算在国外建立中程导弹基地的声明时，密德尔顿写道，伦敦一位“有经验的外交家”认为，除非美国“在很大程度上放弃它对使用导弹的决定权”，西欧国家是不愿意提供导弹基地的。他还指出，欧洲人会提出这样的问题：依靠美国是否能够真正保证安全和弥补北大西洋公约组织带来的牺牲？
