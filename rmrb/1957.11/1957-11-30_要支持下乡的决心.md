    In mid-November, Comrade Yang Benyi of the General Office of the Ministry of Health posted the first big-character poster requesting to go to the countryside to become a farmer. Subsequently, thirteen people jointly posted a big-character poster stating: “Yang Benyi has been with the Ministry since he arrived last September and has consistently been unsettled in his work… This time, his big-character poster requesting to go to the countryside for production is merely a trick, hoping that the organization will grant his request.” The Rectification Leadership Small Group of the General Office of the Ministry of Health immediately posted a big-character poster, expressing support for Yang Benyi’s determination to go to the countryside for training, while also criticizing the opinions of the thirteen people. The thirteen comrades also jointly issued a big-character poster with a self-criticism.

    Sending cadres to participate in labor production is to more effectively cultivate and train cadres. Therefore, for every comrade who requests to go to the countryside for training, regardless of their own shortcomings and mistakes, it should be seen as the beginning of a determination to reform, and they should be given the most enthusiastic support and encouragement. The opinions raised in the joint big-character poster by the thirteen people clearly violate this spirit. The Rectification Leadership Small Group of the General Office was completely correct in doing so.

    要支持下乡的决心
    11月中旬，卫生部办公厅的杨本义同志贴出了第一张要求下乡当农民的大字报。接着有十三个人联名贴出一张大字报，上面写着：“杨本义在去年9月来部，一直不安心工作，……他这次上书申请下乡生产的大字报，不过是玩弄手段，希望组织答应他的要求。”卫生部办公厅整风领导小组立即贴了大字报，一方面表示支持杨本义下乡锻炼的决心，同时对十三个人的意见作了批评。那十三位同志也联名出大字报作了检讨。
    下放干部参加劳动生产，是为了更有效地培养和锻炼干部，因此，对每个要求下乡锻炼的同志，不管他本人有多大的缺点和错误，都应该看作是决心改造的开始，应该给予最热情的支持和鼓励。像十三人联名大字报中提出的意见，显然违背了这一精神。办公厅整风领导小组这样做是完全正确的。
