    Soaring French Commodity Prices

    Recently, French commodity prices have been soaring like an out-of-control hydrogen balloon. According to official statistics published by the French "National Institute of Statistics," which are obviously understated, the most dramatic price increases are in vegetables and fruits, an item not included in the price index. The following are the figures released by the French "National Institute of Statistics":
    
    Item		October 1956		October 1957		Increase
     		Price per kg (Francs)	Price per kg (Francs)	Percentage
    Pears		145			276			90%
    Carrots	38			68			79%
    Apples		136			240			76%
    Grapes		156			230			47%
    Lentils		132			176			33%
    Cauliflower	56			72			28%
    Chives		67			86			28%

    From November 3rd, the price of sugar in France increased by eight francs per kilogram, and the price of wine increased by five francs per liter. The general public in France is constantly complaining, but the monopoly capitalists under the wing of the French ruling group are overjoyed.

    Due to the eight-franc increase per kilogram of sugar, the large capitalists who monopolize sugar beet cultivation have gained an extra profit of 8 billion francs, and sugar merchants and refinery owners have also gained a profit of 3 billion francs. The people of France have become their victims.

    The five-franc increase per liter of wine allows the French colonists who have vineyards in Algeria to reap a staggering 25 billion francs in windfall profits.

    The soaring of French commodity prices has aroused widespread dissatisfaction among the French people. Not long ago, an article in the weekly "France Observateur" by the newspaper's reporter about a tour of the Paris market has implicitly become a very good proof. According to the author of this article: Pot-bellied capitalists, exploitative brokers, and glib market swindlers have all become cursed people in the eyes of the French people. (Leshan)

    扶摇直上的法国物价
    最近一个时期，法国的物价有如失去了控制的氢气球扶摇直上。根据法国“国家统计局”所发表的、显然缩小了的官方统计数字，法国的食品价格上涨得最凶的是物价指数里所未列入的一个项目：蔬菜与水果。以下是法国“国家统计局”所发布的数字：品　名　	1956年10月	　1957年10月	　上涨
     		 每公斤的价　	  每公斤的价	　的百
    		 格（法郎）　	  格（法郎）	　分率梨　		145		　276		　90％胡萝卜　	38		　68		　79％苹　果　	136		　240　		  76％葡　萄　	156		　230		　47％扁　豆　	132		　176		　33％菜　花　	56		　72		　28％韭　菜　	67		　86		　28％
    从11月3日起，法国的食糖每公斤提价八个法郎，酒的价格每公升上涨五个法郎。法国一般市民莫不叫苦连天，但是在法国统治集团卵翼之下的垄断资本家却喜出望外。
    由于食糖每公斤上涨八个法郎，垄断甜菜种植的大资本家获得了八十亿法郎的额外利润，糖商与炼糖厂的老板也获得了三十亿法郎的利润。而法国的人民就成了他们的牺牲者。
    酒的价格，每公升提高五个法郎，竟使在阿尔及利亚开设葡萄园的法国殖民者大约可以获得二百五十亿法郎的暴利。
    法国物价的扶摇直上，引起了法国人民普遍的不满。不久以前，“法西兰观察家”周刊发表的该报记者巴黎市场巡礼的一篇文章，无形中成了一个很好的证明。据这篇文章作者的透露：大腹便便的资本家、剥削起家的经纪人、油腔滑调的市侩，在法国人民的眼睛里都成了该受诅咒的人。（乐山）
