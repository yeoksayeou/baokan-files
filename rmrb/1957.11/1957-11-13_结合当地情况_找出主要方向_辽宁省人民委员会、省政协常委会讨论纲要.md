(Reported by Liaoning Daily) On November 9th, the 23rd meeting of the Liaoning Provincial People's Committee and the 31st meeting of the Standing Committee of the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference were held jointly to discuss the "National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) from 1956 to 1967."

The meeting considered that the agricultural development program is a great program for socialist construction in rural areas. Encouraged by the draft program, the province's agriculture has achieved two consecutive bumper harvests. This revised draft of the agricultural program further summarizes the experience of cooperation over the past two years, is more explicit and suitable for specific situations than in the past, and will certainly give the province's farmers an unparalleled and enormous encouraging force to better build the country's rural areas. Participants particularly discussed Articles 6, 7, 17, 19, 23, 27, and 29 of the Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) in light of the province's specific conditions. Many committee members believed that increasing fertilizer is an important measure to increase agricultural production. There are many sources of manure in both urban and rural areas of the province, but they have not been fully utilized. The agricultural and health departments should pay attention to this. Some people pointed out that Liaoning Province had conservative ideas in the past in the work of improving old-fashioned farm tools and popularizing new-style farm tools. In the future, it should actively improve old and popularize new-style farm tools; special attention should be paid to developing a diversified economy in mountainous areas, with a focus on developing grain production and striving to achieve self-sufficiency, and more cadres should be assigned to mountainous areas; rural areas should plant more high-yield crops such as corn and potatoes to meet the needs of the country and the people; it is necessary to carry out education on diligence and thrift in running cooperatives and managing households in a diligent and thrifty manner through specific examples. Others suggested that the work of eliminating the four pests in our province this year has been somewhat slackened. For the sake of crops and the health of the people, the health department should focus on this work.

    结合当地情况　找出主要方向
    辽宁省人民委员会、省政协常委会讨论纲要
    本报讯　据辽宁日报消息：11月9日，辽宁省人民委员会第二十三次会议与政协辽宁省委员会常委会第三十一次会议联合举行，讨论了“1956年到1967年全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）”。
    会议认为：农业发展纲要是农村社会主义建设的伟大纲领，在纲要草案的鼓舞下，全省农业连续获得了两次大丰收。这个农业纲要修正草案是进一步总结了两年来合作化的经验，比过去更加明确和适合于具体情况，一定会给全省农民以无比巨大的鼓舞力量，更好地建设祖国的农村。与会者特别联系本省情况热烈地讨论了农业发展纲要（修正草案）的第六、七、十七、十九、二十三、二十七、二十九等条。许多委员认为：增加肥料是增加农业生产的一项重要措施，全省城乡粪源很多，但尚未能充分加以利用，农业和卫生部门应当重视。有些人指出：辽宁省过去在改良旧式农具和推广新式农具工作上有保守思想，今后应积极改良旧的和推广新式农具；应当特别注意发展山区多样经济，其中要以发展粮食为主，争取做到自给，应多下放一些干部到山区；农村应多种苞米、薯类等高产作物，以适应国家和人民的需要；要以具体事例深入进行勤俭办社、勤俭持家的教育。还有人提出：今年我省除四害的工作有些松劲，为了庄稼和为了人民的健康，卫生部门应抓紧这项工作。
