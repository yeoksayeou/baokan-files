Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, November 28th: A celebration was held in Tirana on the 27th to mark the 45th anniversary of Albania's declaration of national independence and the 13th anniversary of Albania's liberation.

Present at the celebration were Albanian Labor Party and government leaders Hoxha and Shehu, as well as members of the Czechoslovak National Assembly delegation currently visiting Albania, Soviet Ambassador to Albania Ivanov, and diplomatic envoys from various countries.

Albanian People's Assembly Presidium Chairman Lechi delivered a report at the meeting. He said that Albania declared national independence in 1912, ending generations of oppression. However, this did not equate to the genuine liberation of the Albanian people. Only because of the Soviet Union and the Albanian Labor Party was Albania's freedom and independence permanently guaranteed. The Albanian people warmly thank the Labor Party, the inspirer and organizer of all our victories, and the great friend, the Soviet Union, that liberated our people and gave us fraternal assistance.

Lechi said that in the thirteen years since liberation, we have achieved remarkable accomplishments. Our country has diplomatic relations with twenty countries in Europe, Asia, and Africa. Our government pursues a policy of developing relations with all countries on the basis of equality and mutual respect. In particular, our government hopes to establish good relations with neighboring countries, especially to expand relations with Yugoslavia. Our party and government's foreign policy has always been one of peace and international cooperation. The eternal and unbreakable friendship between our country and our people with the Soviet Union, with the fraternal Soviet people, is the cornerstone of this policy.

Lechi said that thanks to the new and tremendous assistance provided to us by the Soviet Union, the prospect of completing the Second Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule has unfolded before us. The Albanian people are very clear that without unity with the socialist camp headed by the great Soviet Union, Albania could not have obtained freedom. Lechi then emphasized that the Albanian people believe that the declaration of the meeting of the Communist and Workers' Parties of socialist countries and the declaration of peace reflect their good wishes.

Also speaking at the celebration were representatives of the working class, the Democratic Front, and national youth, women, and other social organizations. (Attached picture)

    庆祝独立四十五周年和解放十三周年
    阿尔巴尼亚举行隆重庆祝大会
    据新华社地拉那28日电　地拉那人民27日举行了庆祝大会，庆祝阿尔巴尼亚宣布民族独立四十五周年和阿尔巴尼亚解放十三周年。
    出席庆祝大会的有阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和政府领导人霍查、谢胡等，还有正在阿尔巴尼亚访问的捷克斯洛伐克国民议会代表团人员、苏联驻阿尔巴尼亚大使伊凡诺夫以及各国外交使节。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民议会主席团主席列希在会上作了报告。他说，阿尔巴尼亚在1912年宣布民族独立，结束了世世代代所受的压迫。但是，这还不等于阿尔巴尼亚人民的真正解放。只是由于苏联，由于阿尔巴尼亚劳动党，阿尔巴尼亚的自由和独立才永远地得到了保证。阿尔巴尼亚人民热烈感激我们全部胜利的鼓舞者和组织者——劳动党，感激解放我国人民和给予我们兄弟援助的伟大朋友苏联。
    列希说，在从解放以来的十三年当中，我们获得了卓越的成就。我们国家同欧洲、亚洲、非洲的二十个国家有着外交关系。我们的政府执行着在平等和互相尊重的基础上同所有国家发展关系的政策。尤其是，我们政府希望同邻国建立良好的关系，特别是扩大同南斯拉夫之间的关系。我们党和政府的外交政策过去和现在始终是和平和国际合作的政策。我们国家和我国人民同苏联、同兄弟苏联人民的永恒和牢不可破的友谊是这个政策的基石。
    列希说，由于苏联提供给我们的新的巨大援助，在我们面前展开了提前完成第二个五年计划的前景。阿尔巴尼亚人民非常清楚，没有同以伟大的苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结，阿尔巴尼亚就不可能获得自由。列希随后着重说，阿尔巴尼亚人民认为社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议的宣言以及和平宣言反映了自己的美好的愿望。
    在庆祝大会上讲话的还有工人阶级、民主阵线以及全国青年、妇女和其他社会团体的代表。（附图片）
