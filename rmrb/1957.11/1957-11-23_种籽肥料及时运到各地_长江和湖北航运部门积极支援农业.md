Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 21st. As of now, the large quantities of seeds, fertilizers, farm tools, and pesticides, etc., entrusted by various regions to the Yangtze River and Hubei inland river shipping departments for transport to rural areas have all been delivered.

The shipping departments here have always attached great importance to transporting materials needed for agricultural production, especially giving priority to transporting seeds. In October this year, the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region sent people to Sichuan to transfer broad bean seeds, with a very tight deadline. Under the unified dispatch of the Yangtze River Navigation Administration, this batch of bean seeds, after arriving in Yichang, Hubei from Wanxian, Sichuan, was immediately transported from Yichang to Hunan by the Dongshan Fleet without delay. Currently, the Yangtze River shipping departments mostly adopt direct transportation methods for delivering seeds and fertilizers. For some that require transshipment, they also ensure that they are transshipped as soon as they arrive. In the past, chemical fertilizers transported from Nanjing to Hubei were all transshipped from Hankou to various places; now, many ships also stop at small towns along the Yangtze River such as Longping, Qizhou, Lanxi, and Bahe, directly delivering chemical fertilizers to various places.

This year, the shipping departments also lowered the freight rates for chemical fertilizers. The Yangtze River Navigation Administration reduced the freight for transporting chemical fertilizers by 28% compared to last year, and Hubei's inland rivers also reduced it by 10%. Since last year, the Yangtze River and inland rivers such as the Hanshui River have also implemented joint river-sea transportation. In recent years, the shipping departments have not only ensured the timely transportation of materials such as seeds and fertilizers, but also ensured the quality of transportation.

    种籽肥料及时运到各地
    长江和湖北航运部门积极支援农业
    据新华社武汉21日电　到目前为止，各地委托长江和湖北内河航运部门运往农村的大量种籽、肥料、农具、农药等都已全部运送完毕。
    这里的航运部门历年来十分重视运输农业生产所需要的物资，特别优先运输种籽。今年10月，广西省僮族自治区派人到四川调运蚕豆种，期限十分紧迫。在长江航运管理局统一调度之下，这批豆种从四川万县到达湖北宜昌以后，立即由东山船队从宜昌运往湖南，没有耽搁。现在，长江航运部门运送种籽、肥料，大部分采取了直达运输的办法。一部分需要转口运输的，也保证随到随转。过去从南京运来湖北的化学肥料，都从汉口转运各地；现在许多船舶也在沿江龙坪、圻州、兰溪、巴河等小城镇停靠，直接把化学肥料运到各地。
    航运部门今年还降低了化学肥料的运价。长江航运管理局运送化学肥料的运费比去年降低了28％，湖北省内河也降低了10％。从去年开始，长江同汉水等内河还实行了江河联运。这几年，航运部门不仅保证种籽、肥料等物资的及时运转，而且保证了运转质量。
