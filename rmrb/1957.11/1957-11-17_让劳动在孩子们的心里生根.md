Let labor take root in children's hearts
Cao Shu

    Educating children to love labor and develop labor habits from an early age is an indispensable part of communist education. Parents should love labor and engage in a certain amount of physical labor to set a good example for their children; at the same time, they should also provide specific labor education for their children.

    Some parents believe that their children are too young to engage in any labor; other parents are afraid that labor will affect their children's development, so they arrange everything for their children and do not allow them to engage in any light labor. This is not good for children at all.

    Allowing children to engage in physical labor within their capabilities is not only very beneficial to their physical health and development, but also an important means of developing children's intelligence and cultivating their moral character. Children's simple physical labor and thinking and imagination activities are connected. When engaging in labor, they will consider what to do and how to do it; through labor, they will become familiar with the characteristics and uses of certain items; when they encounter difficulties, they will have to use their brains and consider how to solve them. This can develop children's thinking, increase their knowledge, and cultivate a love of labor.

    How to cultivate children's labor habits?

    We know that children's labor activities are closely related to their daily life and family life. The most effective way to carry out labor education is to cultivate children's habits of self-service in daily life. For example: teach children to eat by themselves without being fed by adults; guide children to learn to dress, undress, button, and tie shoelaces as soon as possible, as well as neatly fold clothes and make their own beds; let children learn to wash their hands and faces by themselves, and gradually learn to wash their necks, ears, brush their teeth, and wash their feet... These seem like small things, but they are of particular importance for cultivating children's independent living abilities. Children who are too young cannot learn to do many things at first. Parents should patiently help them gradually learn to do things themselves, one by one. In the process of helping, parents should set an example for their children, point out the methods of labor, and cultivate their interest in labor. For example, when helping a child get dressed, say:
  “Now I’ll button it for you, but how do you put on socks? Can you put them on yourself?” Then hand the socks to him. So the child starts to "work" energetically. Maybe he can't put them on right away and needs a little help, and then he puts them on. Then say to him:
  “Look, you’re so capable! You’re almost a big kid!” Children like encouragement, which increases their interest in self-service. Over time, children will develop the ability to live independently, and will not rely on their parents for help in everything. They will say, "I'll do it myself."

    Many of children's labors are combined with games, and games are also an important method for conducting labor education. Parents should make good use of toys so that children can learn labor and life knowledge in games. Many children like "dolls," so parents teach children to put dolls to sleep, dress them, undress them, wash their clothes, ..., and in the process of helping the "dolls" arrange their lives, children realize how they should live their own lives. If children like to play with building blocks, explain to them through building blocks how houses are built. After children finish playing games, they should be educated to tidy up their toys themselves, put them in a certain place, and stack them neatly and orderly. For older children, they can also be taught to make various toys with paper, cardboard, scrap wood, etc., which can not only cultivate children's labor habits, but also develop their creative spirit.

    As children grow older, the content of their labor should gradually become more complicated. Parents should guide them to help adults with some daily housework, according to the children's abilities. From simply fetching and carrying things, tidying up the dining table, to more complex work. Through daily housework, further cultivate children's habits of diligence, neatness, and care for utensils, so that they care and respect every kind of adult labor from an early age.

    In short, in family life, cultivating children's self-service, managing their own toys, and helping parents with some housework, all of these can effectively cultivate children's labor habits. For these labor activities of children, parents should tirelessly remind and guide them to do them regularly, so as to gradually develop good habits. The results of children's labor should be checked and evaluated regularly, and any small achievements should be encouraged, which also helps to cultivate children's labor habits.

    Parents must remember one thing: the main purpose of educating children about labor is to cultivate their correct attitude towards labor, so that they can gain great pleasure from labor and its results, and thus learn the ability to live. Therefore, when children's labor results are not good, do not use sarcasm or punishment, or use delicious food to tempt children to labor, which are all very harmful educational methods.

    让劳动在孩子们的心里生根
    曹述
    教育儿童从小就热爱劳动，养成劳动习惯，这是共产主义教育中不可缺少的内容。做父母的应当爱劳动，从事一定的体力劳动，为孩子们树立良好的榜样；同时，也要对孩子具体地进行劳动教育。
    有些家长认为孩子年龄小，不能从事什么劳动；也有些家长生怕劳动影响了孩子的发育，什么事情都替孩子安排好，不让他们从事任何轻微的劳动。这对孩子没有一点好处。
    让儿童从事力所能及的体力劳动，不仅对于他们的身体健康和发育有很大好处，而且也是发展儿童智力，培养儿童道德品质的重要手段。儿童的简单体力劳动和思维、想像活动是联系在一起的。在进行劳动的时候，他们会考虑到做什么和怎样做；通过劳动他们会熟悉某些物品的特性和用途；当遇到困难的时候，他们要动动脑筋，考虑怎样解决。这就能发展儿童的思维，能增加儿童的知识，并养成热爱劳动的习惯。
    怎样培养孩子们的劳动习惯呢？
    我们知道，孩子们的劳动活动是跟他们的日常生活和家庭生活紧密地联系着的。最有效的进行劳动教育的方法，是使孩子在日常生活中养成自我服务的习惯。例如：教孩子不用大人喂，自己吃饭；从小就诱导儿童尽快地学会自己穿衣服、脱衣服、扣扣子、系鞋带，以及整齐地叠放衣服，铺自己的床铺；让孩子学会自己洗手、洗脸，逐渐学会洗脖子、洗耳朵、刷牙和洗脚……。这些看来都是些小事情，但对于培养孩子的独立生活能力，却有着特殊重要的意义。年龄太小的儿童不可能一开始就学会做许多事情，家长们要耐心地帮助他们逐渐地、一项一项地学着自己做。在帮助的过程中，要为孩子做出榜样，向他们指出劳动的方法，培养他们的劳动兴趣。例如，帮助孩子穿衣服时说：
  “现在我给你扣扣子，可是袜子是怎样穿法呢？你自己会穿吗？”然后把袜子交给他穿。于是孩子便起劲地“劳动”起来，也许他并不能马上穿上，需要稍微帮助一下，他就穿好了。然后对他说：
  “看，真能干！快变成大孩子啦！”孩子们是喜欢鼓励的，这样就增加了他们的自我服务的兴趣。时间长了，孩子就会养成独立生活的能力，凡事不依赖父母的帮助，他们会说：“我自己做”。
    孩子们的许多劳动都是跟游戏结合在一起的，通过游戏也是进行劳动教育的重要方法。家长们应当很好地利用玩具，使儿童在游戏中学习劳动和生活的知识。许多孩子都喜欢“布娃娃”，家长们就教给孩子安置娃娃睡觉，给他穿衣服、脱衣服、洗衣服，……，在帮助“娃娃”安排生活的过程中，使儿童认识到自己应该怎样生活。孩子喜欢玩积木，就通过积木向孩子说明房子是怎样建筑起来的。儿童游戏完了以后，要教育他们自己把玩具收拾好，放在一定的地方，堆放得整洁、有秩序。对于年龄稍大一点的孩子，还可以教他们用纸、厚纸板、碎木料等制作各种玩具，这既能培养孩子的劳动习惯，又能发展他们的创造精神。
    随着年龄的增长，孩子进行劳动的内容应当逐渐复杂起来。家长要根据儿童的能力，诱导他们帮助大人做一些日常家务事情。从简单的拿送东西，收拾饭桌，一直到更复杂的工作。通过日常的家务劳动，进一步培养儿童养成勤劳、整洁、爱护器物的习惯，使他们从小就关心和尊重大人的每一种劳动。
    总之，在家庭生活中，培养孩子自我服务，管理自己的玩具，帮助家长做些家务事等，所有这些都能有效地使小孩子养成劳动的习惯。对于孩子的这些劳动活动，家长们要不厌烦地经常提醒和指导他们去做，才能逐渐养成良好的习惯。对于孩子的劳动成果要经常进行检查和评定，对任何一点微小的成就都要加以鼓励，这也有助于培养孩子的劳动习惯。
    家长们千万要记住一点：对孩子进行劳动教育，主要是培养他们正确的劳动态度，使他们从劳动和劳动成果中获得极大的快乐，从而学会生活的能力。因此，在孩子劳动成果不好时，不要进行讽刺和责罚，或者用好吃的东西引诱孩子进行劳动，这都是极有害的教育方法。（附图片）
