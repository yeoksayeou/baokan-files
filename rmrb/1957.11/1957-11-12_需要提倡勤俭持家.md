Factory and Mine Investigation

    It is necessary to advocate diligence and thrift in managing households
    The Party Committee Office of the Tractor Factory of China
    In order to understand the current living conditions of the workers, we conducted a relatively comprehensive investigation of the twenty-eight households with families in the metal structure workshop of the non-standard equipment workshop of the Tractor Factory.
    There are fifty-one people in this workshop, and twenty-eight of them have families, accounting for 54.9% of the total number of people. The average technical level of the workers in the entire workshop is 4.2, which is basically the same as the current average technical level of 4.1 for workers in the entire factory. The average wage of the workers in the entire workshop is 56.55 yuan, which is also similar to the average wage of 56.35 yuan for workers in the entire factory. Among these twenty-eight workers, twenty-five are old workers with more than six years of service, and three have less than six years. Among them, fourteen households had families as early as 1952; seven households were newly married and established families in the past five years; and the other seven households could not afford to bring their families in the past, but in recent years, due to the increase in wages and the state's implementation of many employee benefits (such as the construction of a large number of employee dormitories with very low rents, and the implementation of half-price public medical care for family members, etc.), they have newly moved their families to the city.
    Life is much better, with fewer difficulties
    The living standards of these twenty-eight households can be roughly divided into five types.
    The first category: Affluent households with an average of more than 18 yuan per person per month for living expenses. There are twelve such households. These households are well-fed and well-clothed, all eating refined grains, generally three meals a day, with vegetables at every meal, and constantly eating some meat (about 2.5 jin per person per month) and eggs. They have enough clothes, adding two or three new sets of light clothing per person per year on average, and usually have three or four sets to change. If they plan their lives a little, they can have monthly savings. To specifically illustrate the living standards of this type of household, we investigated the monthly expenses of each household. Here is a selection of one household:
    Chen Caigen, a fifth-grade worker, has a monthly income of 77.45 yuan and a family of four. The average is 19.3 yuan per person per month. The monthly expenses are as follows:
    96 jin of rice, 12.22 yuan; 1 chicken, 1 yuan; 2 jin of cooking oil, 1.12 yuan; 7 jin of fish, 3 yuan; 2 jin of salt, 0.32 yuan; 70 eggs, 3 yuan; 5 jin of soy sauce, 1.25 yuan; 6 jin of vermicelli, 3.6 yuan; 4.12 jin of pork, 3 yuan; 200 jin of coal, 100 jin of firewood, 3.56 yuan; plus other expenses totaling 42.57 yuan, averaging 10.64 yuan per person. Add to that about 2.82 yuan for monthly necessities (soap, towels, etc.), 0.75 yuan for lamp oil (living in the countryside, no rent, no electricity), 0.77 yuan for union dues, 2.2 yuan for children's pocket money, and 9 yuan for his own smoking and spending money, totaling 58.11 yuan per month. If he does not buy clothes for a month, he can save 19.34 yuan. The living conditions of other affluent households are generally the same.
    The second category: Upper-middle-class households with an average of 15 to 18 yuan per person per month for living expenses. There are six such households. These households are basically the same as the affluent households in their daily lives, but they eat less meat, averaging about 1.5 jin per person per month. They do not have as much clothing as the affluent households, but they have complete winter and summer clothes. They can cope with some unexpected events economically. Under normal circumstances, if planned well, they can also have some monthly savings.
    The third category: Middle-class households with an average of 12 to 15 yuan per person per month for living expenses. There are five such households. Their staple food is also all refined grains, and they often eat vegetables, but in smaller quantities than the first two types of households. They do not often eat meat, usually buying some meat on Sundays to improve their meals. Under normal circumstances, they can afford daily expenses and seasonal clothing. Unless major unexpected events occur in the family, they generally maintain a balance of income and expenditure. If they live a simple life, they can still have a slight monthly surplus.
    For example, Shang Tingjian, a fifth-grade worker, has a monthly income of 65.5 yuan, a family of five, and an average of 13.1 yuan per person. His monthly expenses are roughly as follows:
    103 jin of white flour, 17.8 yuan; 20 jin of rice, 2.8 yuan; 2.13 jin of cooking oil, 1.6 yuan; 3+ jin of salt, 0.5 yuan; 1 yuan for soy sauce and other condiments; 6 yuan for vegetables; 3 jin of pork (eaten on average three times a month), 1.8 yuan; 400 jin of coal, plus firewood, a total of 5.6 yuan; totaling 37.1 yuan, with an average cost of 7.4 yuan per person. Adding to this 3 yuan for rent and utilities, 1.5 yuan for Party dues, union dues, and mutual aid savings, 2.5 yuan for daily necessities (towels, soap, etc.), and 3.5 yuan for his own and children's pocket money, the total monthly expenses are 47.6 yuan, leaving a monthly surplus of 17.9 yuan. Therefore, since this spring, in addition to buying a set of light clothing for each member of the family on average, his wife bought a woolen coat, the children bought a pair of sneakers, and paid 14 yuan in medical expenses, he sent back more than 30 yuan to his father, and currently maintains a balance of income and expenditure without owing any debts.
    The fourth category: Lower-middle-class households with an average of 11 to 12 yuan per person per month for living expenses. There are four such households. These households are the same as the middle-class households in their daily lives, but in terms of daily vegetables, some eat pickles once or twice a month. They generally improve their living conditions once or twice a month. If they are careful and plan well, they can afford daily life and clothing, and can cope with seasonal clothing changes. Otherwise, seasonal clothing, especially in the event of unexpected events, will cause difficulties.
    The fifth category: Poor households with an average of 9 yuan per person per month for living expenses. There is only one such household. This household's staple food is also pure refined grains, and the side dishes are half vegetables and half pickles. They also eat meat once or twice a month. In this way, their wage income can only cover living expenses and rent and utilities. In the event of illness or accidents, they experience economic difficulties. Last year, the trade union provided 76 yuan in relief. Most people are satisfied with their current lives, but a few have excessive demands
    In this survey, we also gained a general understanding of the changes in the living conditions of workers from 1952 to the present. In the past five years, due to the continuous increase in wages, the living standards of the vast majority of workers have improved to varying degrees. In terms of food, it used to be half coarse grains and pickles, but now it is all refined grains and vegetables. In terms of clothing, it used to be generally two sets to change, but now it is three or four sets; it used to be foreign cloth, but now it is khaki and poplin, and a few households have even put on high-grade woolen cloth. Generally, they have added some furniture year by year and bought alarm clocks. Some workers have even brought watches. Most workers are satisfied with the gradual improvement of their lives, as they now live in state-built worker dormitories. For example, Shang Tingjian, a middle-class household, now earns more than 60 yuan a month. In addition to sending some back to his parents in the countryside, his family of five here eats refined grains every day and has a constant supply of vegetables. He feels that it is really not bad. Zhang Wensheng, a middle-class household, bought two new quilts after the wage reform last year, and the whole family added new clothes. They no longer eat coarse grains on a daily basis, and feel that their lives have improved a lot. In the past, he rented an old private house in Zhengzhou for 5 yuan a month, but now he lives in a new large room, and pays only more than 2 yuan a month for rent and utilities, and also feels that the fees are really too low.
    However, there are also a few people who have excessive demands in their thinking. For example, Li Taide, an affluent household, has a family of four with a monthly income of 89.5 yuan, and regularly eats meat and eggs, but he still feels dissatisfied. Some people smoke Flying Horse cigarettes that cost 2.5 jiao per pack every day, but still feel that the quality has been reduced and that they would rather smoke Da Qianmen.
    Living is not thrifty, and there is no habit of saving
    Judging from the income of these twenty-eight households, if they plan well, it can be said that most of them can achieve savings. However, only two households currently have savings. The vast majority of workers spend as much as they have, eating and spending everything they earn. Once they encounter an accident, even affluent households cannot cope with it temporarily and have to resort to temporary debt. Among the above-mentioned twelve affluent households, four are currently in debt. Originally, households above the middle class could solve temporary debts by saving themselves, but some people want to rely on relief as soon as they encounter external debt. For example, Wang Yaowu, a worker with a family of four and a monthly income of 54 yuan, received 90 yuan in back pay last year, and immediately spent 120 yuan to buy a watch. This spring, his wife gave birth to a child and fell ill, spending over a hundred yuan. He usually has no savings at all, resulting in a debt of 60 yuan. On the one hand, he complained to the trade union about his financial difficulties, and on the other hand, he continued to buy alcohol. Another example is Sun Tongzeng, a worker, borrowed 320 yuan from the government to move his family back to his hometown. After returning home, he failed to move his family and ran out of money. You Jizhen, a seventh-grade worker, saved some money and quickly spent 160 yuan to buy a watch for his son. He borrowed some more money and spent 200 yuan to buy a bicycle, leaving him with very little money. Recently, because there are often sick people in his family, he owes more than 100 yuan and cannot repay it, so he immediately applied to the trade union for 85 yuan in relief.
    The above situation shows that some workers still lack the ideological style of hard work, thrift, and planned spending. In the future, it is necessary to vigorously conduct education in this area for workers and advocate diligence and thrift in managing households.
    Late marriage and contraception should be advocated, and families should not be moved to the city
    The excessively rapid birth rate also affects the improvement of workers' lives. Among these twenty-eight households, removing the six households that were newly married or whose couples were not together in the past, the remaining twenty-two households added thirty new children in five years, increasing the burden. Some even faced difficulties. For example, Jiang Xinmin, a poor household, had a salary of only 30 yuan before and after 1954, but now his salary has increased to 45 yuan, but his life is not as good as it used to be. The reason is that when he got married in 1952, the population was small, and his wife could still wash clothes for others, earning 6-7 yuan a month to subsidize the family. In recent years, two children have been added in succession, greatly increasing the burden. At the same time, his wife has no way to free up her hands to engage in sideline income to subsidize the family, so life has become more and more difficult. In view of this situation, we believe that it is necessary to advocate late marriage and vigorously promote contraception among young workers.
    In recent years, it has almost become a trend for enterprise employees to move their families to the city. Looking at these twenty-eight households, there are fourteen households that have newly moved and newly built families in the past five years, accounting for one-half. In addition to this, there are also twelve people in this workshop who are actively applying for housing, and some have been approved. If these twelve households all move in, then the number of workers with families will account for more than 80% of the current total number of people in this workshop, which will inevitably cause housing difficulties. In addition to education, this issue must also be restricted institutionally to avoid a sharp increase in the urban population, causing many aspects of incoordination.

    需要提倡勤俭持家
    中共拖拉机厂党委办公室
    为了了解职工目前的生活状况，我们对拖拉机厂非标准设备车间金属结构工段二十八户带家属的职工，逐户地进行了比较全面的调查。
    这个工段共五十一人，带家属的二十八人，占总人数的54．9％。全工段工人平均技术等级是四点二级，和全厂目前工人平均技术等级四点一级基本相等。全工段工人平均工资五十六元五角五，也和全厂工人平均工资五十六元三角五相差不多。在这二十八户工人中，有六年以上工龄的老工人二十五人，不足六年的三人。其中有十四户在1952年就带有家属；七户是最近五年内新结婚，新建立起来的家庭；另七户过去带不起家属，近年来由于工资提高和国家举办了很多职工福利（如建设了大批职工宿舍，租金很低，实行家属半价公费医疗等），才将家属新搬到城市来的。
    生活好过的多，困难的少
    这二十八户的生活水平，大体可分为五种类型。
    第一类：按供养人口每人每月平均合十八元以上的富裕户，这一类有十二户。这类户是丰衣足食，全部吃细粮，一般每日三餐，餐餐有蔬菜，并不断吃些肉（每人每月约二斤半）和鸡蛋。衣服比较充足，平均每人每年要添两身或三身新单衣，平常都有三、四身替换的。如果生活上稍加计划，可以做到月月有节余。为了具体说明这类户的生活水平，我们曾调查了每户一个月的开支情况。现选择一户写在这里：
    陈才根，五级工，每月工资收入七十七元四角五，四口人。每人每月平均十九元三。一个月的开支情况是：
    大米九十六斤，十二元二角二；鸡一只，一元；食油二斤，一元一角二；鱼七斤，三元；食盐二斤，三角二；鸡蛋七十个，三元；酱油五斤，一元二角五；粉条六斤，三元六角；大肉四斤十二两，三元；煤两百斤，木柴一百斤，三元五角六；加上其他支出合计四十二元五角七，每人平均十元六角四。再加每月日常用品（肥皂、毛巾等）约支出二元八角二，灯油（住在农村，不出房租，没有电灯）七角五，工会会费七角七，小孩零花二元二，本人抽烟零用九元，每月共计支出五十八元一角一。如一月不添衣服，即可节余十九元三角四。其他富裕户的生活情况大致都是如此。
    第二类：按供养人口每人每月平均十五至十八元的中上等户。这一类有六户。这类户在日常生活上和富裕户基本相同，只是吃肉较少些，每月每人合一斤半左右。衣服没有富裕户那么充足，但也是冬棉、夏单齐全。遇到一些意外，经济上也可应付。在一般情况下，如果计划得好，每月也可有些节余。
    第三类：按供养人口每人每月平均十二至十五元的中等户。这一类有五户。他们的主食也全部是细粮，蔬菜经常吃，但在数量上要比上两类户少一些，肉食不经常，一般都是每逢星期日买点肉变变饭。在正常情况下，日常零用、季节换衣可以自理。家庭不发生重大意外的事，一般都是保持收支平衡。如生活过得简朴些，每月还可稍有节余。
    如尚廷建，五级工，每月工资收入六十五元五，五口人，每人平均十三元一，每月大致开支如下：
    白面一百零三斤，十七元八角；大米二十斤，二元八角；食油二斤十三两，一元六角；食盐三斤多，五角，酱油等调味品一元；蔬菜六元；大肉三斤（每月平均吃三次），一元八角，煤四百斤，加上木柴，共五元六角；合计三十七元一角，每人平均费用合七元四角。再加上房租水电费等其他支出三元，党费、工会会费及互助储金一元五角，日常生活用品（毛巾、肥皂等）二元五角，本人及小孩零花三元五角，每月共计支出四十七元六角，每月还可节余十七元九角。因此，今春以来，除全家每人平均添一身单衣，爱人买了绒衣，小孩买了一双球鞋，和付出医药费十四元外，给父亲寄回三十多元，目前还保持收支平衡，没有欠债。
    第四类：按供养人口每人平均十一十二元的中下等户。这一类有四户。这类户在日常生活上和中等户相同，不过日常吃菜上，有的每月一顿或两顿是咸菜。一般每月也要改善一两次生活。如精打细算，安排得好，日常生活和添置衣服可以自理，季节性换衣也可应付。否则，季节性添衣，特别是遇意外事时，就要发生困难。
    第五类：按人口平均每人每月合九元的困难户。这一类只有一户。这一户主食也是纯细粮，副食是青菜咸菜对半，每月也要吃一两次肉。这样，工资收入只能应付生活费用及房租水电费，遇有疾病意外，经济上就显困难。去年曾由工会救济了七十六元。多数人满意目前生活，少数人有过高要求
    我们在这次调查中，对职工从1952年到现在的生活情况的变化也作了一般的了解。五年来，由于工资不断增长，职工生活水平绝大部分都有不同程度的改善提高。在吃的方面，过去是对半粗粮、咸菜，现在是全部细粮、蔬菜。穿的方面，过去一般都是两身替换，现在是三、四身；过去是洋布，现在则是卡叽、府绸，有个别户还穿上了高级呢绒。一般逐年来都添置了一些家具，买了闹钟，有些职工还带上了手表。住的方面，现在大都住上了国家新建的职工宿舍。因而，职工们对生活逐年改善的情况大都感到满意。如中等户尚廷建，现在工资六十多元，除给在农村的老人寄回一些外，全家五口在这里，天天吃细粮，蔬菜不断，他觉得实在是不错了。中等户张文生在去年工资改革后，买了两条新被子，全家都添了新衣服，日常也不吃粗粮了，觉得生活改善不少。过去他在郑州租私人一间旧平房，每月出房租五元，现在住了一个新的大房间，每月连水电费只两元多，也觉得收费实在有些太低。
    但是，也有少数人思想上还有过高的要求。如富裕户李太德，全家四口人，每月收入八十九元五角，经常吃着肉类鸡蛋，但他还感到不满足。也有的人每天抽着每盒二角五分的飞马烟，还觉得降低了质量，不如抽大前门。
    生活不俭省，没有储蓄习惯
    从这二十八户的收入来看，如果安排得好，可以说大多数都可以做到有节余。可是现在有积蓄的仅有两户，绝大多数工人是有多花多有少花少，吃干花净。一旦遇有意外，就连富裕户一时也无法应付，还得临时拉饥荒。在上述十二户富裕户中，目前就有四户欠债。本来像中等以上的户，一时欠债可以自己节约解决，但有些人一遇外债就想依靠救济。如工人王耀武四口人每月收入五十四元，去年补发工资九十元，一下子就用一百二十元买只手表。今春由于老婆生孩子又生病，花了百十元，平时又没有一点积蓄，弄到欠债六十元。他一方面向工会诉说经济困难，另方面自己还不断买酒喝。又如工人孙同增借公家三百二十元回乡搬家属，回去一趟，家没搬成，钱也花光了。七级工尤继振，手中存了几个钱，赶紧用一百六十元给儿子买只手表，自己又借些钱，用二百元买辆自行车，手底弄得很空。最近因为家里常有病人，欠债一百多元不能偿还，一下子就向工会申请救济八十五元。
    以上情况说明，一部分工人还缺乏艰苦朴素、有计划花钱的思想作风，今后有必要对职工大力进行这方面的教育，提倡勤俭持家。
    应当提倡晚婚、避孕，不要搬家属进城
    人口出生率过快，也影响职工生活的改善。在这二十八户中，除去新婚不久和过去夫妇不在一起的六户外，其余二十二户在五年内新添了三十个小孩，负担因此加重，有的甚至造成困难。如困难户姜新民，1954年前后工资只有三十元，现在工资增加到四十五元，可是生活反倒不如过去。原因是1952年才结婚时，人口少，爱人还可以替人家洗点衣服，每月收入六——七元贴补家庭。近年来，接连添了两个小孩，负担大大加重，同时爱人也无法腾出手来搞点副业收入贴补家庭，因而生活变得越来越困难了。鉴于这种情况，我们认为有必要在青年职工中提倡晚婚和大力宣传避孕。
    近年来，企业职工搬家属来城市，几乎成了一种风气。从这二十八户看，五年内新搬和新建的家庭就有十四户，占二分之一。除此以外，这个工段还有十二人积极申请要房子，有的已被批准。如果这十二户再都搬来，那末带家属的职工人数就要占这个工段目前总人数的80％以上，势必要造成住房的困难。对这个问题，除了进行教育外，还必须从制度上加以限制，以免城市人口急剧增加，造成许多方面的不协调。
