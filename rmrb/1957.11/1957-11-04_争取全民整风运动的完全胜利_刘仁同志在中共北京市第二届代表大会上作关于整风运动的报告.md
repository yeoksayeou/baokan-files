    Strive for the Complete Victory of the Whole People's Rectification Movement
    Comrade Liu Ren's Report on the Rectification Movement at the Second Congress of the CPC Beijing Municipal Committee

    The Second Congress of the CPC Beijing Municipal Committee, held its second meeting from October 28th to November 1st, to discuss the issue of striving for the complete victory of the whole people's rectification movement.

    Comrade Liu Ren, Second Secretary of the CPC Beijing Municipal Committee, delivered a report to the congress on the rectification movement on behalf of the Municipal Committee. The congress discussed and adopted this report, requesting that Party organizations at all levels in the city, in accordance with the instructions of the Third Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and the work report of the Municipal Committee, strengthen their leadership over the rectification movement and strive for the complete victory of this whole people's rectification movement.

    In his report, Liu Ren systematically summarized the experience of Beijing's rectification and anti-rightist struggle in the previous period, and put forward the task of further developing the whole people's rectification movement in all aspects.

    Liu Ren said that freely mobilizing the masses to speak out freely and air their views fully is a prerequisite for doing a good job in the rectification movement. However, in order to let people speak out freely and well, in addition to making specific arrangements in our work, the leadership must be fully ideologically prepared. That is: First, leading cadres of each unit must fully understand the benefits of speaking out freely and airing views fully, have the courage and determination, not be afraid of storms, not be afraid of "being burned," and not be afraid of "trouble," and consciously mobilize the masses to speak out freely and air views fully. Second, we must trust the majority of the masses and trust the leadership of the Party. For example, in universities, when rightists were frantically attacking us, many middle-of-the-roaders were indeed temporarily lost, and wavered in their attitude toward the Party and socialism. However, after explaining the situation and the pros and cons to them, the situation gradually reversed. Moreover, it has in turn more profoundly educated the masses, further consolidated the leadership of the Party, and enhanced the prestige of the Party. In industrial and mining enterprises, not only is there a considerable number of Party members, but also veteran workers as the backbone, and the situation is even more different after the anti-rightist struggle. Therefore, in late May, thirty-three universities simultaneously launched a large-scale speaking out freely and airing views fully campaign, and in August and September, industrial, mining, construction, commercial enterprises, and rural areas also launched a large-scale speaking out freely and airing views fully campaign. Not only did it not affect production, but on the contrary, in many units, the enthusiasm of workers and staff for production was even higher, and production was even better.

    Liu Ren said that after the climax of speaking out freely and airing views fully or under the conditions of the victory of the anti-rightist struggle, we must immediately launch a climax of major rectification and major reform, and major debate and major contention, concentrate our efforts to boldly, resolutely, and thoroughly improve our work, quickly overcome the various shortcomings and errors in our work and style, and once again freely mobilize the masses to launch full discussions and debates on the basic policies of the country and major issues in our work, so as to systematically conduct socialist education for the broad masses.

    When doing this, the leadership's determination and resolutely following the mass line become two key issues for boldly, resolutely, and thoroughly improving work. Many units are now accepting correct criticisms and suggestions from the masses, vigorously and swiftly improving their work, and in conjunction with the improvement of their work, mobilizing the masses to continue to put forward opinions and express their views, setting off a new climax of speaking out freely and airing views fully. This approach saves time and yields quick results, and has won the enthusiastic support of the broad masses. However, there are also some units that did not immediately grasp the improvement of their work after the victory of the anti-rightist struggle, or did not pay attention to continuing to mobilize the masses to put forward opinions after entering the rectification and reform stage, so the rectification movement in these units appeared to be weak. There are also a few places that have adopted a perfunctory and evasive attitude towards the criticisms and suggestions of the masses, resulting in some formalistic phenomena that only count the items, do not ask about the actual effect, only seek to pass the test, and do not seriously check the results of rectification and reform. These shortcomings must be resolutely corrected.

    Liu Ren pointed out that major rectification and major reform, and major debate and major contention, must be carried out in combination. Only by launching debates on major issues in the political life and work of the country, allowing all kinds of different opinions or solutions to problems to be put forward, fully discussing and comparing them, distinguishing right from wrong, raising awareness, and unifying understanding, can we most effectively solve problems and improve our work. Of course, the situations in various aspects and units are different, and the key points and central links of the rectification movement in each period should also be different.

    Liu Ren then put forward the task of further developing the whole people's rectification movement in all aspects.

    The current urgent task of universities is to quickly launch a vigorous and swift climax of improving work and rectifying the work style. First of all, we must earnestly study the opinions put forward by the masses in the past, quickly resolve those problems that can be solved immediately, report to the masses, and then launch another climax of speaking out freely and airing views fully, mobilizing the masses to fully use big-character posters, symposiums, and other methods to put forward opinions on the work and work style of cadres in various aspects of the school, so as to promote the improvement of work. Most schools have already started doing this, and the effect is very good, and the masses are very enthusiastic, and have put forward many constructive good opinions. The issues that need to be addressed at present are: Teachers must be mobilized in a thorough and meticulous manner, and leading cadres should take small symposiums, individual heart-to-heart talks, and other methods to dispel their concerns and enable them to speak freely; at the same time, we must oppose the attitude of "major issues are difficult to change, minor issues are not worth changing," and the many problems related to learning conditions and living conditions raised by the masses in various schools that should be solved and are easy to solve must be solved in a timely manner.

    From the large number of facts revealed by the masses, it can be seen that how to earnestly implement the policy of building the country and running schools industriously and thriftily is an urgent task. All schools should fully utilize the opportunity of the rectification movement and socialist ideological education to resolutely rectify the administrative management work of the school, be determined to streamline institutions, reduce personnel, establish some necessary and feasible systems, and organize teachers and students to debate various practical issues related to the implementation of the policy of building the country and running schools industriously and thriftily, so that the policy of running schools industriously and thriftily will be deeply rooted in the hearts of the people and become the actual action of the masses.

    Liu Ren said that improving teaching work and improving teaching quality is a major link in the school's improvement of work. In this climax of speaking out freely and airing views fully, the opinions of the masses on teaching work account for about one-third. Among them, there are many problems that urgently need to be solved and can be solved, and all schools should mobilize teachers to actively and conscientiously discuss and study them, and strive to improve them. In addition, some major issues in the school, such as expanding the proportion of children of workers and peasants entering school, professional settings, training goals, and the length of schooling that cannot be solved in a short period of time, or issues that the school has no right to solve, should be organized for teachers to study, and solicit the opinions of students, graduates of the school, and the departments that use cadres, draw up improvement plans, and submit them to higher authorities for review and approval, and implement them in the next semester or after the summer vacation next year.

    On the basis of the victory of the anti-rightist struggle, conducting systematic socialist ideological education in conjunction with rectification and reform is an important task of universities. In the anti-rightist struggle, we refuted the most prominent reactionary views of the bourgeois rightists, but in the short two or three months of struggle, we still cannot completely crush the various fallacies of the bourgeoisie, and the market for various bourgeois ideas in universities is still very large. Bourgeois ideas are prominently manifested in: (1) Demanding bourgeois democracy and freedom. Some people put democracy and centralism, freedom and discipline in opposition to each other, demanding so-called "absolute democracy," "absolute freedom," and "absolute equality," believing that the proletarian dictatorship and the centralized leadership of the Party are the root cause of undemocratic and unfree conditions. (2) Believing that the Party cannot lead higher education, obsessing over the bourgeois educational traditions of the old universities, negating the adjustment of departments, negating learning from the Soviet Union, negating the necessity of planned training of talents according to the needs of national construction, and pursuing so-called "genius education, free development." (3) Disdaining labor, disdaining workers and peasants, disdaining practice, disdaining politics, denying the necessity of ideological transformation of intellectuals, and promoting the fallacy of so-called "expertise first, then red." They are unwilling to go to factories and rural areas, unwilling to go to difficult places, and unwilling to engage in industrial and agricultural production labor for a long time. Although these erroneous ideas have been criticized in the anti-rightist struggle, they have not been criticized systematically and thoroughly. Socialist education in schools should be directed against these erroneous ideas, and all teachers and students should be mobilized to launch a major debate. This debate should shift from a storm-like form to a gentle and gentle form, and various opinions should be allowed to contend, and those who are criticized should be allowed to argue, the more controversy, the deeper the debate. In addition, for units where the anti-rightist struggle is not deep enough, or the criticism of rightists is not deep or thorough enough, the anti-rightist struggle should be carried out in conjunction with major rectification and major reform, and major debate and major contention. For rightists who have been criticized in the previous stage and are now counterattacking, the masses should continue to be mobilized to thoroughly criticize them.

    The situation in industrial and mining, construction, transportation, and commercial enterprises is different from that of universities, as this is not a place where intellectuals are concentrated. The outstanding contradictions revealed in the large-scale speaking out freely and airing views fully are the contradictions between leaders and the led, bureaucratism, sectarianism, and subjectivism in the style of cadres, confusion and waste in production management, and issues related to the wages, rewards, and welfare of workers and staff. Most of these criticisms and opinions are good and stem from good intentions; there are also some reactionary remarks and activities. In this case, the rectification movement in these units must, after the climax of speaking out freely and airing views fully, immediately take some time to launch a climax of improving work, and then turn to a major socialist debate.

    The rectification movement in industrial and mining, construction, transportation, and commercial enterprises should achieve two basic goals: The first is to overcome shortcomings and errors in leadership and run socialist enterprises well; the second is to rectify the ranks of the working class, first ideologically and politically, and finally organizationally.

    Improving work should be done in batches, and it should be revised two, three, four, or five times. First of all, we must grasp the problems of cadre work style that the masses have the most opinions about, especially the problems of the work style of leading cadres, and those who should admit their mistakes should admit their mistakes, and those who should be dealt with immediately should be dealt with immediately. Revise a batch, mobilize the masses to discuss it once, and continue to speak out freely and air views fully. Repeatedly concentrate and adhere to this, the relationship between leaders and the masses will improve, the consciousness of the masses will continue to improve, and the improvement of work will become deeper and deeper. Especially for issues that involve larger interests or the vital interests of the masses, such as streamlining institutions, reducing full-time personnel, and issues related to living welfare such as rent, water, electricity, and family hospitality, it is even more necessary to fully discuss them with the masses before making a decision. Solving problems must be both fast and good, and it must be done so that all that should be changed and can be changed are changed, and the opinions raised by the masses are accounted for item by item, and resolutely prevent and correct the shortcomings of not doing what should be done, not doing what is said, passing the buck, or making grandstanding, making promises indiscriminately, and making wishful thinking. Therefore, it is necessary to check and re-examine while solving problems.

    The broad masses of workers in Beijing, especially the veteran workers, have shown a high degree of class consciousness in the anti-rightist struggle and the rectification movement. However, in recent years, a large number of new workers, especially young intellectuals, have been added to the ranks of workers, bringing various non-proletarian ideas to the ranks of the working class, and at the same time, due to our insufficient ideological education and some shortcomings in our work, some workers, especially some young workers, are growing the erroneous ideas of only caring about personal interests, disregarding national interests, and demanding excessively high wages and too much welfare regardless of the country's economic conditions. Without overcoming these erroneous ideas among some cadres and workers, socialist enterprises cannot be run well. Therefore, for new workers who come from landlord, rich peasant, and capitalist families and other non-proletarian backgrounds, we should help them transform their positions; in new enterprises with more new workers, especially young intellectuals, we should clearly put forward the task of ideological transformation, rely on veteran workers to educate and transform new workers, and large-scale speaking out freely and airing views fully, and carrying out major socialist debates, are the best forms to raise the consciousness of workers and staff, transform the thinking of new workers, and gradually solve unreasonable phenomena in wages and welfare in a planned way.

    The great debate must strengthen leadership. In the process of the great debate, the leadership must continue to improve its work, and guide the high socialist enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers and staff into further deepening the movement to increase production and practice economy, and strive to complete and overfulfill the first five-year plan and welcome the second five-year plan.

    Attention should be paid to conducting socialist education for the families of workers and staff. All families living in concentrated areas shall be led by the Party organizations of the enterprises in a unified manner.

    To conduct socialist ideological education among street residents, according to the experience of factories, rural areas, and schools, we must first speak out freely and air views fully, freely mobilize the masses to fully put forward opinions and express views on the work and work style of cadres in grassroots units such as district and street Party and government organs, shops, schools, hospitals, etc., as well as other issues of concern to the masses. Through speaking out freely and airing views fully, fully expose the problems in these grassroots units, earnestly improve our various work that is related to the broad masses of residents every day, and then hold a great debate. The topic of the great debate should revolve around issues such as saving food and cotton cloth, mobilizing idlers in the city to return to their hometowns to engage in production, eliminating the four pests, cherishing public property, and maintaining public order, and establish the idea of labor is glorious, building the country industriously and thriftily, and managing the family industriously and thriftily, and reversing the social atmosphere.

    In recent years, a large number of workers and staff members' families have poured into the city, and there are many idlers in the city. They originally participated in agricultural production in the countryside, but after coming to the city, they cannot participate in labor or have work to do. If this continues for a long time, they will become vagrants and parasites, and because the urban population is increasing too quickly, it has caused the tension in various aspects such as urban housing, material supply, public transportation, schools, and hospitals, which has increased many contradictions and increased the burden on the country. A debate should be launched among all residents, including all workers' and staff members' families and cadres' families, to vigorously mobilize those who can go back to their hometowns to participate in agricultural production and play an active role in the great cause of building a new socialist countryside.

    Handicraft production cooperatives, small and medium-sized grassroots units in the commercial system, all joint state-private enterprises, small vendors, industrial and commercial households that have not been transformed, tricycle households, large vehicle households, and various laborers such as porters and casual workers must also carry out large-scale speaking out freely and airing views fully, and conduct socialist ideological education, and do not omit them in this movement. Among small vendors, we must oppose speculation and profiteering and oppose undermining market management. For industrial and commercial households that have not implemented fixed interest rates, we must further manage, restrict, and transform them in the great socialist debate.

    To carry out large-scale speaking out freely and airing views fully and a great socialist debate in these units, it must be carried out in batches and phases under the leadership of a strong work team, based on the strength of the cadres and specific conditions. Various departments at the city and district levels should transfer a large number of cadres, led by responsible cadres, to go deep into the grassroots to participate in and lead this movement.

    Liu Ren also made a specific analysis and deployment of the rectification movement in the suburban rural areas and municipal-level organs. He pointed out that the central link of the current rural rectification movement is to carry out the great socialist debate to the end, debate deeply and thoroughly, and in conjunction with the debate, improve work vigorously. To carry out a resolute and reasoned struggle against various capitalist ideas and words and deeds among rich middle peasants. But it is still a contradiction among the people, and it must be emphasized to use the method of persuasion and education to make rich middle peasants stand on the socialist position wholeheartedly. The municipal-level organs must also quickly launch a climax of improving work. The rectification and reform work cannot be limited to the internal organs, and leading cadres should personally take action, go deep into the grassroots, read big-character posters, participate in symposiums, systematically study the criticisms and suggestions put forward by the masses, and assist the grassroots units in solving problems, it is necessary to study them systematically and systematically, propose solutions, convene a representative meeting of grassroots units for full discussion, and then implement them.

    Liu Ren said that in this movement, all aspects have exposed some bad elements of various kinds, such as hooligans, thieves, murderers, embezzlers, serious criminals who seriously disrupt public order, seriously violate laws and discipline, and people who are generally recognized as bad people by the public. The contradiction between them and the people is no longer a contradiction among the people, but a contradiction between ourselves and the enemy. In addition to fighting them in the movement, they must be punished according to law. The Party organizations of various political and legal departments should overcome right-leaning thoughts and strengthen the struggle against the above-mentioned various bad elements. Various organs, enterprises, and schools should strengthen discipline education for their members, and for those who are naughty and seriously violate discipline and refuse to be reformed after repeated education, they should be expelled after careful review.

    In his report, Liu Ren also analyzed and deployed the issues of streamlining institutions, reducing full-time personnel, and improving the combat effectiveness of the Party and the Communist Youth League. He said that among the 130,000 people in the city's organs, enterprises, and schools, about 50,000 people can be reduced. A very small number of the people who are reduced should be transferred to strengthen the leadership of grassroots units, and the vast majority of the rest should directly participate in labor production, mainly participating in agricultural production. Putting a large number of cadres on the labor front for long-term training is not only to solve the problem of the future of the cadres who are reduced, but also to train cadres and to create a new team of working-class intellectuals. This is of profound historical significance for our socialist construction. In the future, cadres can only be promoted from personnel who have been trained in production labor and have close ties with workers and peasants. In addition, in organs, schools, and enterprises, we must summarize the experience of leading cadres and teachers and students participating in physical labor, and set it as a system according to the specific conditions of each unit and adhere to it.

    Liu Ren finally proposed: When the rectification and reform of each unit comes to an end, it is necessary to appropriately shift to the stage of everyone studying documents (workers and peasant Party members with low cultural levels can skip studying documents and take other methods for education), criticizing and reflecting, and improving themselves. In this stage, it is necessary to systematically and deeply solve the ideological problems within the Party. Every Party member must examine their own thoughts, positions, and viewpoints, criticize and overcome individualism, departmentalism, absolute egalitarianism, and liberalism, and among grassroots cadres, they must also overcome commandism. This kind of examination and criticism, for a large number of new cadres from exploiting families, is to establish a revolutionary outlook on life and solve the problem of the proletarian stance. For Party members with various erroneous ideas, as long as they are not bourgeois rightists, traitors, or serious violators of laws and discipline, they must adhere to the principle of curing diseases and saving people, proceed from the formula of "unity-criticism-unity," and vigorously and sincerely help them correct their mistakes and shortcomings, improve their working methods, and improve their working ability, ideological level, and political level.

    There were 602 representatives attending this meeting, and 161 responsible personnel from Party organizations of factories, universities, and various departments at the city and district levels attended as observers.

    争取全民整风运动的完全胜利
    刘仁同志在中共北京市第二届代表大会上作关于整风运动的报告
    本报特约新华社3日讯　中共北京市第二届代表大会在10月28日到11月1日举行的第二次会议上，讨论了关于争取全民整风运动的完全胜利的问题。
    中共北京市委员会第二书记刘仁同志代表市委向大会做了关于整风运动的报告。代表大会讨论和通过了这个报告，要求全市党的各级组织根据党的八届三中全会的指示和市委的工作报告，加强对整风运动的领导，争取这次全民整风运动的完全的胜利。
    刘仁在报告中系统地总结了前一时期北京市整风和反右派斗争的经验，提出了在各个方面进一步深入开展全民整风运动的任务。
    刘仁说，放手发动群众大鸣大放，是搞好整风运动的前提。但是要放得开、放得好，除了工作上要作具体安排外，领导上必须要有充分的思想准备。这就是：首先，要使各单位领导干部充分了解大鸣大放的好处，有勇气，有决心，不怕狂风暴雨，不怕“放火烧身”，也不怕“闹事”，自觉地放手发动群众大鸣大放。其次，要相信群众的多数和相信党的领导。例如，在高等学校中，当右派分子向我们猖狂进攻的时候，许多中间分子确曾一时迷失了方向，对党和社会主义发生动摇，但在向他们讲清形势、说明利害以后，形势就逐渐扭转了。而且，反过来更加深刻地教育了群众，更加巩固了党的领导，提高了党的威信。在工矿企业中不但有相当数量的党员，而且有老工人做为骨干，又经过了反右派斗争形势就更加不同。因此，5月下旬在三十三所高等学校中同时大鸣大放，8、9月间又在工矿、建筑、商业企业和农村中大鸣大放，不但没有影响生产，相反地，许多单位，职工的生产积极性更高了，生产更好了。
    刘仁说，在大鸣大放的高潮以后或者在反右派斗争胜利的条件下，必须紧接着展开一个大整大改、大辩大争的高潮，集中力量大胆地、坚决地、彻底地改进工作，迅速克服我们工作上、作风上的各种缺点、错误，并且再一次放手发动群众，就国家各项基本政策和工作中的重大问题展开充分的讨论和争辩，从而对广大群众系统地进行社会主义教育。
    在这样做的时候，领导上有决心，坚决地走群众路线，就成为大胆地、坚决地、彻底地改进工作的两个关键问题。现在许多单位正在接受群众正确的批评和建议，雷厉风行地改进工作，并且结合着工作的改进，发动群众继续提意见、发议论，掀起新的鸣放高潮。这样做，费时少而收效快，得到了广大群众热烈的拥护。但是，也有一些单位在反右派斗争胜利以后，没有立即抓紧改进工作，或者在转入整改阶段以后，没有注意继续发动群众提意见，因此这些单位的整风运动就显得没有力量。还有少数地方对群众的批评和建议采取敷衍和应付的态度，发生了一些只算条条，不问实效，但求过关，不认真检查整改结果的形式主义现象。这些缺点必须坚决改正。
    刘仁指出，大整大改和大辩大争，必须结合进行。只有对国家政治生活和工作中的重大问题，展开辩论，让各种不同的意见或解决问题的方案通通提出来，充分加以讨论和比较，辨明是非，提高思想，统一认识，才能够最有效地解决问题，改进工作。当然，各个方面、各个单位的情况不同，整风运动在每个时期的重点和中心环节也应有所不同。
    刘仁接着提出了在各个方面进一步深入开展全民整风运动的任务。
    高等学校当前迫切的任务是：迅速发动一个有声有色的雷厉风行的改进工作、整顿作风的高潮。首先要切实研究过去群众提出的意见，把那些马上可以解决的问题迅速解决，向群众作报告，接着再一次发动鸣放高潮，发动群众充分利用大字报、座谈会等方式，对学校各方面的工作和干部作风提意见，来推动工作的改进。现在多数学校已经开始这样作了，效果很好，群众热情很高，提出了许多建设性的好意见。目前需要注意解决的问题是：对教师必须进行深入、细致的动员，由领导干部采取小型座谈会、个别谈心等方式，解除他们的顾虑，使他们畅所欲言；同时，要反对“大事不好改，小事不屑改”的态度，各校群众对于学习条件和生活条件提出的很多应当解决也容易解决的问题，必须及时加以解决。
    从群众揭发的大量事实可以看出，如何切实贯彻勤俭建国、勤俭办学的方针是一个迫切的任务。各校应该充分利用整风运动和社会主义思想教育的时机，对学校行政管理工作坚决加以整顿，下决心紧缩机构、减少人员，建立一些必要和可行的制度，组织教师和学生就贯彻执行勤俭建国、勤俭办学的各项实际问题进行辩论，使得勤俭办学的方针深入人心，变成群众的实际行动。
    刘仁说，改进教学工作，提高教学质量，是学校改进工作的一个主要环节。在这次鸣放高潮中，群众对于教学工作的意见约占三分之一左右。其中有许多问题，是迫切需要解决也可能解决的，各校应该发动教师，积极地认真地讨论研究，努力改进。另外，学校中有些重大问题，如扩大工农子女入学的比例、专业设置、培养目标、学制等短时期解决不了的问题，或学校无权解决的问题，应该组织教师研究，并征求学生、本校毕业生和使用干部的部门的意见，拟出改进的方案，提交上级机关审核批准，在下学期或明年暑假以后实施。
    在反右派斗争胜利的基础上，结合整改进行系统的社会主义思想教育，是高等学校的一项重要任务。在反右派斗争中，我们驳倒了资产阶级右派最突出的反动观点，但是在短短两三个月的斗争中，还不能彻底粉碎资产阶级的各种谬论，各色各样的资产阶级思想在大学中的市场还很大。资产阶级思想突出地表现在：（1）要求资产阶级民主和自由。有些人把民主和集中、自由和纪律对立起来，要求所谓“绝对民主”、“绝对自由”、“绝对平等”，认为无产阶级专政和党的集中领导是造成不民主、不自由的根源。（2）认为党领导不了高等教育，迷恋旧大学的资产阶级教育传统，否定院系调整，否定学习苏联，否定根据国家建设需要有计划地培养人材的必要，而追求所谓“天才教育，自由发展”。（3）轻视劳动，轻视工农，轻视实践，轻视政治，否认知识分子进行思想改造的必要性，宣传所谓“先专后红”的谬论。他们不愿到工厂、农村，不愿到艰苦的地方，不愿长期从事工农业生产劳动。这些错误思想虽然在反右派斗争中已经受到批判，但是还批判得不系统、不彻底。学校中的社会主义教育，应该针对着这些错误思想，发动全体教师、学生展开大辩论。这种辩论应当从急风暴雨的形式转变为和风细雨的形式，要允许各种见解争鸣，允许被批判者进行争辩，争论越多，辩论越深。另外，对于反右派斗争还不深入，或对右派分子的批判还不深不透的单位，应该结合大整大改、大辩大争进行反右派斗争。对于前一阶段已经批判过现在又在反攻的右派分子，还要继续发动群众彻底进行批判。
    工矿、建筑、交通运输、商业企业的情况和高等学校不同，这里不是知识分子集中的地方。大鸣大放中揭发出来的突出的矛盾，是领导与被领导之间的矛盾，是干部作风方面的官僚主义、宗派主义和主观主义，是生产管理上的混乱、浪费和关于职工的工资奖励、生活福利等方面的问题。这些批评和意见绝大部分是好的，是从善意出发的；也有一些反动言论和活动。在这种情况下，这些单位的整风运动，必须在大鸣大放的高潮以后，紧接着拿出一段时间发动一个改进工作的高潮，然后再转入社会主义的大辩论。
    工矿、建筑、交通运输、商业企业的整风运动，要达到两个基本目的，第一是克服领导上的缺点和错误，办好社会主义企业；第二是首先从思想上政治上最后从组织上整顿工人阶级的队伍。
    改进工作要分批改，要两次、三次、四次、五次地改。首先要抓住群众意见最多的干部作风问题，特别是领导干部的作风问题，该认错的就认错，该立即处理的就立即处理。改一批、发动群众讨论一次，继续鸣放。这样反复地集中起来坚持下去，领导和群众的关系就会改善，群众的觉悟不断提高，工作的改进也越来越深。尤其是对于牵涉较大或牵涉到群众切身利益的问题，如紧缩机构，减少脱产人员和有关房租、水电、家属招待等生活福利方面的问题，更要经过群众充分讨论，再作决定。解决问题必须又快又好，要作到应该改的、可能改的都改，群众提的意见，件件都有交代，坚决防止和纠正那种该办不办，说了不办，推出了事，或者是哗众取宠，乱答应、乱许愿的毛病。因此，必须一边解决问题，一边发动群众检查和复查。
    北京市广大工人群众，特别是老工人在反右派斗争和整风运动中表现了高度的阶级觉悟。但是，近几年来工人队伍中新工人，特别是青年知识分子大量增加，给工人阶级队伍中带来了各种非无产阶级思想，同时也由于我们思想教育做得不够和工作上的某些缺点，在一部分工人特别是部分青年工人中，正在滋长着只顾个人利益、不顾国家利益、不顾国家经济条件要求过高的工资待遇和过多的生活福利的错误思想。不克服部分干部和工人中的这些错误思想，社会主义的企业是办不好的。因此，对于地主、富农、资本家家庭出身和其他非无产阶级出身的新工人，应该帮助他们改造立场；在新工人尤其是知识青年较多的新企业中，应该明白地提出思想改造的任务，依靠老工人教育和改造新工人，而大鸣大放、开展社会主义大辩论，就是提高职工觉悟、改造新工人思想、有计划地逐步解决工资福利方面的不合理现象的最好的形式。
    大辩论必须加强领导。在大辩论的过程中，领导上要继续改进工作，要把广大职工高度的社会主义积极性，引导到进一步深入开展增产节约运动，为完成和超额完成第一个五年计划和迎接第二个五年计划而奋斗。
    要注意对职工家属进行社会主义教育。凡是集中居住的家属，一律由企业党组织统一领导进行。
    在街道居民中进行社会主义思想教育，根据工厂、农村、学校各方面的经验来看，还是要首先大鸣大放，放手发动群众对区街党政机关、商店、学校、医院等基层单位的工作和干部作风以及其他群众关心的问题充分提意见，发议论。通过大鸣大放，充分揭露这些基层单位中的问题，切实改进我们同广大居民天天发生关系的各项工作，然后再举行大辩论。大辩论的题目要围绕着节约粮食、棉布，动员城市中闲杂人口还乡生产，除四害，爱护公共财产，维护公共秩序等问题，树立劳动光荣、勤俭建国、勤俭持家的思想，扭转社会风气。
    几年来有大量职工家属拥入城市，城市中各种闲杂人口很多，他们本来在农村参加农业生产，来到城市后既不能参加劳动，又没有工作可做，长期下去就要变成二流子、寄生虫，而且由于城市人口增加过快，造成城市房屋、物资供应、公共交通、学校、医院等等各方面的紧张状态，增加了许多矛盾，加大了国家的负担。应该在所有的居民，包括所有的职工家属、干部家属中开展一场辩论，大力动员那些能够回去的回乡参加农业生产，在建设社会主义新农村的伟大事业中发挥积极作用。
    手工业生产合作社、商业系统的中小基层单位、全部公私合营企业、小商小贩、没有改造的工商业户、三轮车户、大车户以及搬运工人、零散工人等各种劳动人民，也必须开展大鸣大放，进行社会主义思想教育，不要在这次运动中漏掉他们。在小商小贩中，要反对投机倒把，反对破坏市场管理。对没有实行定息的工商户，要在社会主义大辩论中进一步加以管理、限制和改造。
    在这些单位内进行大鸣大放和社会主义大辩论，一定要在强有力的工作组的领导下，根据干部力量和具体条件，分批分期进行。市区级各部门应该抽调大批干部，由负责干部带领，深入基层参加和领导这个运动。
    刘仁对郊区农村和市级机关的整风运动，也作了具体分析和部署。指出当前农村整风运动的中心环节就是要把社会主义大辩论进行到底，辩深辩透，并且结合辩论，狠狠地改进工作。同富裕中农中的各种资本主义思想和言行，进行坚决的说理斗争。但是它仍然是人民内部的矛盾，必须强调用说服教育的方法，使富裕中农心悦诚服地站到社会主义立场上来。市级机关也必须迅速掀起一个改进工作的高潮。整改工作不能只限于机关内部，领导干部应当亲自动手，深入基层，看大字报，参加座谈会，系统地研究群众提出来的批评和建议，协助基层单位解决问题，必须通盘地系统地加以研究，提出解决方案，召开基层单位的代表会议充分讨论，然后贯彻执行。
    刘仁说，在这次运动中，各方面都暴露出一些各色各样的坏分子，如流氓、盗窃犯、凶杀犯、贪污犯、严重破坏公共秩序、严重违法乱纪等严重罪犯以及公众公认为坏人的人，他们与人民的矛盾，已经不是人民内部的矛盾，而是敌我矛盾，除了在运动中对他们进行斗争以外，必须依法惩办。政法各部门的党组织应克服右倾思想，加强对上述各种坏分子的斗争。各机关、企业、学校对所属成员应加强纪律教育，对于调皮捣蛋严重地违犯纪律、屡教不改的分子，要经过慎重审查，予以开除。
    刘仁在报告中还就紧缩机构、减少脱产人员以及关于提高党和团的战斗力等问题作了分析和部署。他说，在全市机关、企业、学校现有十三万人员中，可以减去五万人左右。减下来的人员，有极少数应该调去加强基层单位的领导，其余绝大多数要直接参加劳动生产，主要是参加农业生产。把大批干部放到劳动战线上长期加以锻炼，这不仅是为了解决减下来的干部的出路问题，而且是为了锻炼干部，为了造成工人阶级知识分子的新队伍。这对于我们的社会主义建设，有深刻的历史的意义。今后提拔干部只能从生产劳动中经过锻炼，同工农群众有密切联系的人员中提拔。此外，在机关、学校、企业中，都要总结领导干部和师生参加体力劳动的经验，根据各单位的具体条件，定为制度，坚持下来。
    刘仁最后提出：每个单位在整改告一段落的时候，要适时地转入每人研究文件（工农党员文化水平低的，可以不学文件，采取其他方式进行教育）、批评反省、提高自己的阶段。在这一阶段要系统地深入地解决党内的思想问题。每个党员都要检查自己的思想、立场、观点，批判和克服个人主义、本位主义、绝对平均主义和自由主义，在基层干部中，还要克服命令主义。这种检查和批判，对于大批剥削家庭出身的新干部来说，就是要确立革命的人生观，解决无产阶级立场的问题。对于有各种错误思想的党员，只要他们不是资产阶级右派分子、叛徒和严重违法乱纪分子，就要本着治病救人的原则，从“团结—批评—团结”的公式出发，用和风细雨的方式，大力诚心帮助他们改正错误缺点，改进工作方法，提高工作能力、思想水平和政治水平。
    出席这次会议的代表有六百零二人，列席的有工厂、高等学校和市区级各部门党的负责工作人员一百六十一人。
