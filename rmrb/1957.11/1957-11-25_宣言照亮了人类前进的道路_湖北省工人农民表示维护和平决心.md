The workers and peasants of Hubei Province resolutely support the declaration of the meeting of representatives of communist and workers' parties of socialist countries and the peace manifesto of the communist and workers' parties. Xiao Daocheng, Li Bin, and other six delegates preparing to attend the Eighth National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions jointly stated: The two Soviet artificial satellites in the sky and the meeting of communist parties of various countries in Moscow to celebrate the October Revolution show that the era in which the fate of mankind was manipulated by capitalism is gone forever. The peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union is a powerful force for peace, democracy, and the realization of an infinitely beautiful future. These two declarations are the fire of the hearts of hundreds of millions of working people striving for peace, democracy, and social progress, illuminating the path of human progress and opening up a bright and splendid future. Old workers of the "February 7th" strike also held a symposium. Wang Zhihuai said at the symposium that the communist and workers' parties of various countries have promoted the unity of peace-loving people all over the world, which is a guarantee for maintaining world peace.

Rao Xingli, national model agricultural laborer and director of the October Agricultural Cooperative in Xishui County, said that we want to build, we want peace, but we are not afraid of war. Today, the socialist camp is incredibly powerful. If imperialism dares to provoke a third world war, it will inevitably burn itself.

    宣言照亮了人类前进的道路
    湖北省工人农民表示维护和平决心
    本报汉口24日电　湖北省的工人和农民坚决拥护社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议宣言和共产党和工人党的和平宣言。准备出席中国工会第八次代表大会的肖道成、李斌等六个代表联合发言说：苏联的两个人造卫星上了天，和各国共产党在莫斯科集会庆祝十月革命节这两件大事，表明了人类的命运由资本主义摆布的时代已经一去不复返了，以苏联为首的和平民主阵营是和平民主和实现无限美好的未来的强大力量。这两个宣言是亿万劳动人民争取和平民主和社会进步的心灵之火，它照亮了人类前进的道路，开辟了光辉灿烂的远景。“二七”老工人也举行了座谈会。王植槐在座谈会上说，各国共产党和工人党促进了全世界爱好和平人民的团结，就是维护世界和平的保障。
    全国农业劳动模范、浠水县十月农业社主任饶兴礼说，我们要建设，我们要和平，但是也不怕战争。今天社会主义阵营力量无比强大，帝国主义如果胆敢挑起第三次世界大战，必然玩火自焚。
