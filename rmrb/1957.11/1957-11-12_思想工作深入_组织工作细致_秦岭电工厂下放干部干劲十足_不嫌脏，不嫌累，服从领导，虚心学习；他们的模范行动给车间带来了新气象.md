Deep Ideological Work, Meticulous Organizational Work
Qinling Electric Factory Transferred Cadres are Full of Drive
Not Afraid of Dirt, Not Afraid of Hardship, Obey Leadership, Learn with an Open Mind; Their Exemplary Actions Have Brought a New Atmosphere to the Workshop

(Reported by this newspaper) According to the Xi'an Daily, the Qinling Electric Factory has used revolutionary spirit to streamline its enterprise management structure, transferring 358 cadres to production and grassroots leadership positions in three batches. More than 500 other transferred cadres are in the process of completing handover procedures and will soon be completely transferred.

Among the cadres already transferred are technicians, designers, quota setters, data clerks, statisticians, dispatchers, inspection team leaders, accountants, planners, and Party and mass work cadres, as well as mid-level leaders such as section chiefs, workshop directors, and Party branch secretaries. According to the factory's production needs and individual desires, the vast majority of people were transferred to the front lines of labor, while some responsible cadres from offices were transferred to workshops to strengthen grassroots leadership. Among the first batch of 19 transferred cadres, seven were mid-level cadres, all of whom were transferred to the labor front as technicians, apprentices, cooks, and guards.

The factory's transfer work began on October 10th. After the initial plan for streamlining the organization was announced on October 16th, the enthusiasm for transfer rose even higher. More than 1,400 cadres in the factory unanimously requested to be transferred, and more than 90% submitted written applications to the leadership stating their specific transfer wishes. In light of this situation, the factory Party organization conducted detailed investigations and made appropriate arrangements based on the principles of ensuring production and "willingness to transfer, willingness to accept, and willingness to leave," taking into account the number of people needed for each unit and type of work, the wishes of the transferred cadres, and the transfer time for each unit. The specific principles are roughly as follows:

1.  Engineering and technical cadres are basically assigned according to their major, working as lathe operators and other jobs, so that technological theory and practical operation can be combined.

2.  Cadres originally promoted from workers generally continue to work in their original trades.

3.  For leading cadres, depending on the needs and possibilities, some are transferred layer by layer to strengthen grassroots leadership, while others are transferred directly to participate in production.

4.  For demobilized soldiers and veteran cadres, opportunities to learn technical expertise are provided as much as possible, taking into account their age and education level.

The factory's leaders at all levels pay close attention to ideological work. Before each cadre is transferred, the leader of their unit has two or three conversations with them, and many people have also had conversations with factory-level leaders. Before going to the workshop, arrangements for new work tasks, the allocation of mentors, and even preparatory work such as work clothes and teacups for drinking water are all properly arranged. When sending off and receiving, the transferring unit held farewell meetings and discussion meetings, and the receiving unit held welcome meetings. Leaders often visit the transferred cadres, solicit their opinions, and help them solve problems. For cadres who have not yet been transferred, they repeatedly emphasize sticking to their jobs, and according to the personnel changes in their units, they constantly determine the scope of responsibilities for each person, organize labor competitions, and mobilize everyone to work harder. Therefore, those who leave happily embark on new jobs, and those who do not leave work peacefully and efficiently. The transfers are announced and implemented in an orderly manner, and are quite smooth.

After three batches of cadres were transferred, they added new strength to the production front and brought a new atmosphere to the production units. Transferred cadres have high labor enthusiasm, a strong sense of responsibility, observe discipline, and pay attention to uniting with the masses, and have already begun to have a good impact on the masses. The six transferred cadres in the 21st workshop were assigned to work on polishing parts. They were full of energy, did whatever work they were assigned, and took the initiative to ask the team leader for work, which greatly moved the foreman and team leader. In just over a week since the transfer, they have all met their work quotas. Li Cheng, who was originally the Party branch secretary, was transferred to work as an apprentice, carrying water, sweeping the floor, and wiping machines, doing everything, and had good relations with the workers. Originally, some workers were picky about accepting tasks, but after seeing his work attitude, they were moved and said: "He has worked as a leader, is not afraid of dirt, is not afraid of hardship, and does everything. Why can't we do it?" He works very hard to learn the technology. He went to the workshop on October 10th, and now he can already perform some simple operations on the machine tool. Recently, he also plans to sign a teaching and learning contract with his mentor, determined to reach the level of a second-grade worker in three months. Zhao Zhanbiao, the deputy section chief of the welfare section, was transferred to the first cafeteria as a cook. Under his influence and leadership, the cafeteria staff and cooks worked diligently one by one, and the cafeteria work greatly improved. Tang Zhikai, who originally worked in personnel allocation in the cadre section, was transferred to the nursery as a child care worker, washing diapers and taking care of children, doing more work than others and taking care of more children than others, greatly boosting the work enthusiasm of the child care workers. When the first batch of cadres was transferred, some workers were still skeptical, and some individuals said that this transfer was "a gust of wind" and "wouldn't last long." After three batches of transfers, this statement could no longer be heard. Instead, there were big-character posters posted everywhere praising the transferred cadres for their diligent work, unity with the masses, and adherence to discipline and other excellent qualities. In the big-character posters where workers praised Zhao Zhanbiao, Tang Zhikai and others, there was a similar sentiment: We welcome the leadership to transfer more cadres like this.

### 思想工作深入　组织工作细致  秦岭电工厂下放干部干劲十足  不嫌脏，不嫌累，服从领导，虚心学习；他们的模范行动给车间带来了新气象

    思想工作深入　组织工作细致
    秦岭电工厂下放干部干劲十足
    不嫌脏，不嫌累，服从领导，虚心学习；他们的模范行动给车间带来了新气象
    本报讯　据西安日报消息：秦岭电工厂用革命精神紧缩了企业管理机构，分三批把三百五十八名干部下放到生产和基层领导岗位上去，还有五百多名下放干部正在办理移交工作，不久就全部下放。
    已经下放的干部中，有技术员、设计员、定额员、资料员、统计员、调度员、检验组长、会计员、计划员和党群干部，也有科长、车间主任、党支部书记等中层领导干部。根据工厂的生产需要和各人的志愿，绝大多数人都是一放到底，走上了光荣的劳动岗位，也有些科室的负责干部下放到车间去加强基层的领导工作。第一批下放的十九名干部中，有七个人是中层干部，全部下放到劳动战线上作了技工、学徒、炊事员和警卫战士。
    这个厂的下放工作是从10月10日开始的。10月16日全厂紧缩机构的初步方案宣布以后，下放的热潮更加高涨。全厂一千四百多名干部一致要求下放，90％以上的人向领导上递了写明具体下放志愿的申请书。根据这种情况，工厂党组织按照保证生产和“放的愿放、接的愿接、走的愿走”的原则，对各单位各工种需要的人数、下放干部的志愿和各单位下放的时间进行了细致的调查和妥善的安排，既照顾了生产的需要，也尽量考虑了各人的专长、意愿和将来的发展。具体的原则大致有以下几点：
    一、对工程技术干部，基本上按所学专业进行分配，作车工及其他工作，使工艺理论和实际操作相结合。
    二、原由工人中提拔的干部，一般仍作原工种工作。
    三、对领导干部，根据需要和可能，有的是层层下放，加强基层领导工作；有的是一放到底，直接参加生产。
    四、对转业军人和老干部，根据他们的年龄和文化程度尽量给他们学习技术专长的机会。
    工厂的各级领导人员非常注意思想工作。每一干部下放以前，都由本单位领导进行过两、三次谈话，许多人还由厂级领导谈过话；下车间以前，对新的工作任务的安排、师傅的配备，甚至工作服和喝水用的茶杯子等准备工作，全都安排得妥妥贴贴；接送的时候，放的单位开了欢送会、座谈会，接的单位开了欢迎会；对已经下放的干部，领导人员经常去看望他们，征求他们的意见，帮助他们排解困难；对于还没有下放的干部，反复强调坚守工作岗位，并且根据本单位的人员变动，随时确定每个人的职责范围，组织开展劳动竞赛，动员大家加倍努力地进行工作。因此，走的人愉快地走上了新的工作岗位，没有走的人安心地有效率地进行着工作，随公布随下放，有条不紊，相当顺利。
    三批干部下放以后，给生产战线增添了新的力量，也给各生产单位带来了新气象。下放干部劳动热情高、责任心强、守纪律、注意团结群众，已经开始在群众中产生了良好的影响。二十一车间六个下放的干部被分配作磨光零件的工作，他们精神饱满，给什么活做什么活，主动地向组长要活做，使工长和组长很受感动。下放只有一周多一点的时间，他们已经全部达到了工作定额。原来作党支部书记的李成下放作学徒工作，打水、扫地、擦机床，什么活都干，跟工人的团结也搞得很好。原来有些工人接受任务时挑挑拣拣，看了他的工作态度以后，感动地说：“人家作过领导工作，不怕脏，不怕苦，什么也干得，咱们为什么干不得。”他学习技术很努力，10月10日下车间，现在已经可以在机床上进行一些简单的操作。最近他还打算跟师傅订保教保学合同，决心三个月就达到二级工的水平。福利科副科长赵占标下放到第一食堂作炊事员以后，在他的影响和带动下，食堂工作人员和炊事员一个个踏实苦干，食堂工作大有起色。干部科原来做人事调配工作的汤芝楷下放到托儿所作保育员，洗尿布，看孩子，比别人做的活多，看的孩子比别人多，使保育员们的工作劲头大为振奋。在第一批干部下放的时候，有些工人还有些半信半疑，个别人说这次下放是“一阵风”、“干不长”，经过三批下放以后，这种说法已经听不见了，代之而出现的是到处张贴出来的表扬下放干部踏实苦干、团结群众、遵守纪律等优良品质的大字报。在工人们表扬赵占标、汤芝楷等人的大字报上都有这样意思的话：像这样的干部，我们欢迎领导上多多下放。
