Every early summer, when the White Nights descend upon Estonia, the beautiful republic on the Baltic coast, its cities and villages hold their annual traditional festival – the Song Festival. Take the small coastal town of Haapsalu as an example. Every year during the Song Festival, guests come from various districts and cities. The cities and villages are decorated in a riot of colors, as if celebrating the most solemn of festivals, with flags and flowers everywhere. During the festival, people sing their hearts out day and night. On the eve of the Song Festival, a traditional youth torchlight parade is also held. The torchlight shines in the milky white glow of the White Nights, a truly enchanting scene.

The Estonian Republic established Soviet power forty years ago, overthrowing the bourgeois dictatorship and raising the banner of socialist revolution. But like Lithuania and Latvia, its people's regime was quickly strangled by the reactionaries. Estonia spent more than twenty years as a semi-colony before returning to the Soviet family in 1940.

Over the past decade, the beautiful republic has undergone great changes, and the people's lives are becoming happier day by day. Take the fishermen as an example. Fishing is completely different from what it was under bourgeois rule! Fishermen have long joined cooperative organizations. Fishery collective farms own many new types of fishing boats and gear. The days of sailing out to sea in dilapidated boats and being swallowed by the waves are long gone. Fishermen live very prosperous lives. Estonia's fish catch per capita has jumped to third place in the world, second only to Norway and Japan.

During the Soviet era, an industrial zone emerged in the northeast of the republic. From dozens of kilometers away, you can see mountains of oil shale ash scattered among the mines, large power plants, and oil shale processing enterprises. This is the origin of the republic's special product – oil shale, with reserves of billions of tons. Currently, its production is three times higher than before the war, accounting for 65% of the total Soviet production. During the bourgeois regime, the mining area did not receive the development it deserved because foreign monopoly capital did not want such a local fuel industry to compete with them. At that time, Britain forced Estonia to import British coal, and the British and Dutch oil tycoons were also unhappy about Estonia developing its own oil industry. The extremely rich oil shale resources have only been fully utilized under the people's regime.

Estonia, with a population of 1.1 million, is developing prosperously in industry, agriculture, culture, and education. In 1956, Estonia's total industrial output increased by six and a half times compared to 1940, and electricity generation increased by more than four times. Milk production per capita has exceeded that of the United States. Currently, there is an average of 104 university students per 10,000 residents in Estonia, while there are only 37 in France, 30 in Italy, and 27 in West Germany. The capital, Tallinn, on the Gulf of Finland, is a huge port and the center of the republic's industry and culture. (Jun) (with picture)

    风景优美的爱沙尼亚
    每当初夏，白夜降临到爱沙尼亚的时候，波罗的海沿岸这个美丽的共和国的一些城市和乡村，就要举行一年一度的传统节日——歌唱节。就以滨海的小城哈普萨鲁来说吧，每年当歌唱节时，有来自各区和各个城市的客人。城市和乡村都打扮得花枝招展，像是庆祝最庄严的节日一般，到处是旗帜和鲜花。节日期间人们不分日夜纵情歌唱。在歌唱节的前一天晚上，还要按照传统举行青年火炬游行。火光闪耀在白夜的乳白色的光辉中，景色是非常迷人的。
    爱沙尼亚共和国在四十年前就建立了苏维埃政权，推翻了资产阶级专政，高举起社会主义革命的旗帜。但是也同立陶宛和拉脱维亚一样，它的人民政权很快就被反动派扼杀了。爱沙尼亚过了二十多年的半殖民地的日子，1940年才回到了苏联大家庭。
    十多年来，美丽的共和国发生了很大的变化，人民的生活一天比一天更幸福。就以渔民来说吧。捕鱼工作已经同资产阶级统治时代完全变了样！渔民早已加入了合作组织。渔业集体农庄都拥有许多新式渔船和渔具。旧时代驾破船出海捕鱼，遇见风浪而葬身鱼腹的事情，早已不见了。渔民生活非常富裕。爱沙尼亚的捕鱼量按人口平均计算已经跃居世界第三位，仅次于挪威和日本。
    在苏维埃政权年代，共和国东北部出现了一片工业区。在几十公里以外，就可以看见堆积如山的油母页岩的灰烬，散布在矿井、大发电站和油母页岩加工企业之间。这是共和国的特产——油母页岩的产地，它的蕴藏量有几十亿吨。目前它的产量比战前提高了三倍，占全苏联开采量的65％。在资产阶级统治时代，矿区没有得到应有的发展，因为外国垄断资本不愿意有这样一个同它们竞争的地方燃料工业。那时，英国曾强迫爱沙尼亚输入英国煤，英国和荷兰的石油大王也不高兴爱沙尼亚发展自己的石油工业。极端丰富的油母页岩，只是在人民政权下才得到充分利用。
    拥有一百一十万人口的爱沙尼亚，无论在工农业和文化教育事业方面，都欣欣向荣地发展着。1956年，爱沙尼亚的工业总产量比1940年提高了六倍半，发电量提高了四倍多。牛奶产量按人口平均计算已经超过了美国。现在爱沙尼亚每一万居民中平均就有一百零四名大学生，而法国每一万居民中只有三十七名大学生，意大利有三十名，西德二十七名。首都塔林滨芬兰湾，是一个巨大的港口，也是共和国工业和文化的中心。　（君）（附图片）
