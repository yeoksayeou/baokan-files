Xinhua News Agency, Jinan Electric Dispatch: Shou Zhang County in Shandong Province, historically known as a low-yield area, has seen a leap in grain production with the development of agricultural cooperativization. This year, among the county's eighty-eight agricultural cooperatives, excluding a few whose farmland in the Yellow River riverbed area was flooded, the average grain yield per mu was 340 jin, exceeding the average land yield of local prosperous middle peasants by 44%.

Shou Zhang County is located on the north bank of the lower reaches of the Yellow River. Historically, due to repeated breaches of the Yellow River, most of the land was sandy, alkaline, and barren. In addition, farmers were unable to cultivate intensively. In 1953, the average yield per mu in the county was only 146 jin. Even the prosperous middle peasants who occupied good farmland and had strong livestock could only produce 237 jin of grain per mu. In 1954, with the great development of agricultural cooperatives, the Shou Zhang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, based on the specific conditions of the county, vigorously led agricultural cooperatives to improve soil, build farmland water conservancy, and raise pigs to accumulate manure. Since 1954, the county's eighty-eight agricultural cooperatives have adopted methods such as turning sand to cover silt, turning silt to mix sand, and using sand to suppress alkali to deep-plow more than 175,000 mu of sandy-alkaline land and hard silt land to a depth of four to six chi. At the same time, they also shallow-plowed more than 130,000 mu of land, transforming the original barren land with very little grain production into two-soil and "Mengjin land" (i.e., silt land covered with a layer of sandy soil). This measure alone increased grain production by more than 20 million jin per year in the county. Shou Zhang County is close to the Yellow River. In addition to actively restoring dikes for flood prevention and ensuring that the Yellow River does not breach or divert floods, the county also sank wells and dug springs in 6,643 locations in farmland suitable for water conservancy, expanding the irrigated area by more than 66,000 mu. Pig raising in Shou Zhang County has also developed greatly. By the end of October this year, the total number of pigs raised in the county had increased from 8,000 in the winter of 1955 to more than 180,000. Therefore, the application of pen manure to farmland has also rapidly increased from about 1,500 jin per mu to more than 6,500 jin. In addition, agricultural cooperatives have also actively selected good seeds, increased the planting of high-yield crops, and improved farming techniques. Therefore, grain production has leaped from an annual increase of a few percent before 1953 to 25% to 50%, making the county's grain yield per unit area quickly exceed the level of local prosperous middle peasants and become a high-yield grain county in Shandong Province.

With the rapid development of agricultural production, the living standards of the vast number of peasants have also greatly improved. This year, the total grain output of the county, after deducting the public grain, selling surplus grain, and various deductions from the agricultural cooperatives, averaged more than 500 jin of grain per person. Adding sideline income, the net income per person reached 67 yuan, which is 14 yuan more than the average income of local prosperous middle peasants.

### 改良土壤　兴修水利　养猪积肥  寿张县农业生产超过富裕中农水平

    改良土壤　兴修水利　养猪积肥
    寿张县农业生产超过富裕中农水平
    新华社济南电　历史上被称为低产地区的山东省寿张县，随着农业合作化的发展，粮食产量有了跃进上升。今年全县八十八个农业社，除黄河河床区的少数社农田被洪水淹没外，其余平均每亩产粮三百四十斤，超过当地富裕中农平均土地产量44％。
    寿张县在黄河下游北岸，历来由于黄河多次决口，造成大部分土地沙碱瘠薄，又加农民无力精耕细作，1953年全县平均每亩土地的产量仅有一百四十六斤。就是占有耕地好，畜力强的富裕中农，每亩土地也只能产粮食二百三十七斤。1954年，随着农业合作社的大发展，中共寿张县委会根据这个县的具体情况，大力领导农业社改良土壤、兴修农田水利和养猪积肥。全县八十八个农业社从1954年以来，采取翻沙盖淤、翻淤混沙和以沙压碱的办法，将十七万五千多亩沙碱地和硬淤地深翻了四尺到六尺深，同时还浅翻地十三万多亩，把原来产粮很少的瘠薄地改造成两合土和“蒙金地”（即蒙上一层沙土的淤地），仅采取这项措施全县每年即增产粮食二千多万斤。寿张县紧靠黄河，这个县除积极复堤防汛，确保黄河不决口，不分洪外，还在适宜兴修水利的农田里打井、挖泉六千六百四十三眼，扩大水浇地六万六千多亩。寿张县养猪生产也有很大开展，到今年10月底，全县养猪总数已由1955年冬季的八千头增加到十八万多头。因此，农田施圈肥也很快由原来每亩一千五百斤左右增加到六千五百多斤。此外，各农业社还积极选择良种、增种高产作物和提高耕作技术，因此，粮食产量由1953年前的年增百分之几，一跃提高到25％至50％，使全县的粮食单位面积产量迅速超过了当地富裕中农的水平，并成为山东省的粮食高产县。
    随着农业生产的迅速发展，广大农民的生活水平也有很大的提高。今年全县的粮食总产量除去缴纳公粮出售余粮和农业社的各种扣留外，平均每人分得粮食五百多斤，加上副业收入，每人的纯收益达六十七元，比当地富裕中农平均收入多十四元。
