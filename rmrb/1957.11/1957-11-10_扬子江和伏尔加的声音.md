The Voices of the Yangtze and the Volga
Du Mashev

Dear Chinese friends:

First of all, let me extend my brotherly greetings to you from far away Moscow.

We Soviet people are excitedly and joyfully watching your every achievement in economic and cultural construction. Your happiness is our happiness. The consistency of historical development closely unites us. Every day I listen to news about China from newspapers and radio. Not long ago, I was thrilled to learn that the bridge across the Yangtze River had been completed. I cheered with my friends. We all felt that this was not only your festival, but also ours! Because I once worked in China, this good news is even more intimate to me.

Having the opportunity to work in China is the glory and pride of my life. In your great country, I personally witnessed that historic change, and further understood your life today, and the splendid cultural heritage created by the talented and wise people. This ancient culture has a distinct national style.

In May of this year, I accompanied the Central Song and Dance Troupe to the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge for performances. The scene at that time left an indelible impression on me. At that time, we prepared two new programs for the bridge construction work: one was the chorus presented to the bridge builders by Wuhan composer Zeng Licong, and the other was the "Builders' Song" in the Soviet composer V. Makarov's chorus suite "Sturdy River." Our performances were sometimes held on the construction site, and sometimes on the second deck of the bridge. The background of our "stage" was this miracle of 20th-century construction technology - the beautiful bridge!

This meeting and performance can be described as a spectacle. To be honest, I had never been so excited before conducting a chorus, because this time I was conducting Chinese actors on the shore of the Yangtze River, the great river of China, to perform songs praising the builders of communism on the Volga River! One of the lyrics was: "Two dams will be erected on the river!" This sentence deeply moved all our audience, all the actors and the conductor.

I am very proud and excited that it was the cannon sound of the "Aurora," which announced the beginning of a new era in our country forty years ago, that brought Marxism-Leninism to China. After the great October of 1917 in our country, there was the October of the Chinese people in 1949.

Now that the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge has been completed, I have read the report in the "Pravda" in detail, which is just as Deputy Prime Minister Li Fuchun said: "The completion of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge is another symbol of the great friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union."

Dear friends! Let me congratulate you once again!

    扬子江和伏尔加的声音
    杜马舍夫亲爱的中国朋友们：
    首先让我从遥远的莫斯科向你们致兄弟的敬礼。
    我们苏维埃人兴奋而愉快地注视着你们在经济、文化建设中的每一个成就。你们的快乐就是我们的快乐。历史发展道路的一致把我们紧密地团结在一起。我每天从报纸上和广播里倾听关于中国的消息。不久前我又兴奋地知道了横跨扬子江的大桥已经落成。我同我的朋友欢呼起来，我们全认为这不只是你们的节日，而且也是我们的节日！因为我曾在中国工作，所以这件喜讯对我来说也就更加亲切。
    能有机会到中国工作，这是我毕生的光荣与骄傲。在你们伟大的国度里我亲自看到了那历史性的大变化，并且更进一步地了解了你们今天的生活，和那天才智慧的人民所创造的灿烂文化遗产，这古老的文化有着显明的民族风格。
    本年5月我曾经随同中央歌舞剧团到武汉长江大桥进行演出，当时的景象给我留下了永不泯灭的印象。我们当时为大桥建设工作准备了两个新节目：一个是武汉作曲家曾礼聪献给大桥建设者的大合唱，另外一个是苏联作曲家瓦·马卡洛夫合唱组曲“壮士河”中的“建设者之歌”。我们的表演有时在工地举行，有时就在大桥的第二层桥面上。我们“舞台”的背景就是这二十世纪建设技术的奇迹——美丽的大桥！
    这次的会见和演出可以说是蔚为奇观。说句老实话，我在指挥合唱以前还从来没有这么激动过，因为这一次我是在中国的大河——长江的岸上指挥中国演员表演歌颂伏尔加河上共产主义建设者的歌曲！其中有一句歌词是：“两个河坝就要在河上立起！”这一句深深地感动了我们所有的观众、所有的演员和指挥。
    我非常骄傲而兴奋，是四十年前在我国宣布了新时代开始的“阿芙乐尔”的炮声，把马克思列宁主义带到了中国。在我国1917年伟大的十月以后，又出现了1949年中国人民的十月。
    现在武汉长江大桥落成了，我详细地读了“真理报”上的报道，这正如李富春副总理所讲的：“武汉长江大桥的建成，是中苏两国人民伟大友谊的又一个标志。”
    亲爱的朋友们！让我再一次向你们祝贺！
                  杜马舍夫
