The great October Socialist Revolution swept away the gap between science and the people, combined science with life, made science serve construction, and created completely new and particularly favorable conditions for the prosperity and development of science in an unprecedented way. In the short span of forty years after the October Revolution, the Soviet Union transformed from an economically backward agricultural country into the most advanced country in the world with first-class technology. This fully demonstrates the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system and the infinite vitality of Marxism-Leninism.

Under the wise leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Soviet people have moved from one victory to another, achieving great achievements unparalleled in human history. The entire life of the Soviet Union is a series of continuous realization of miracles that people considered "impossible."

First, the working class seized and grasped political power, which was called "impossible" by the enemies of socialism. So was the victory in the struggle against the White Guards and interventionists from 1918 to 1921 after countless setbacks.

Anti-Soviet elements were also very certain that it was impossible to rebuild the war-torn Soviet industry and agriculture, and later they believed that the Soviet Union was incapable of managing its huge new industries that were being built. The five-year plans, which achieved brilliant success one after another, were ridiculed and regarded as mere propaganda tricks. The Red Army, which Hitler expected to defeat in six weeks, played a decisive role in the war to eliminate the heinous military machine of fascism, and rescued the people of many countries from fascist enslavement. The Soviet Union then made the impossible possible, rapidly healed the serious wounds caused by World War II, and achieved unprecedented development.

Shortly after the war, in 1949, another "impossible" thing appeared in the Soviet Union, breaking the monopoly advantage of the US imperialism’s atomic bomb. The US imperialists believed that it would take the Soviet Union twenty to forty years, or even longer, to have an atomic bomb. In fact, the Soviet Union lagged behind the United States by only four years. In 1953, the Soviet Union conducted its first hydrogen bomb explosion, only eight months after the United States, shattering the US imperialists' dream of conquering the world.

Since then, the Soviet Union has taken the lead, and amazing achievements have emerged one after another. Undeniably, the Soviet Union has become the most advanced country in the world in terms of science, technology, and engineering.

On June 27, 1954, the Soviet Union announced that the world's first nuclear power plant had been put into production. In the Sixth Five-Year Plan, the power of the nuclear power plants built by the Soviet Union reached 2 million to 2.5 million kilowatts.

On March 23, 1956, the Soviet Union's Tu-104 jet airliner flew non-stop from Moscow to London in three and a half hours. Then, the Soviet Union put this type of aircraft into commercial air routes.

On April 16, 1957, the world's largest synchrophasotron, which could accelerate protons to an energy of 10 billion electron volts, began operating near Moscow.

On August 26, 1957, the Soviet Union successfully launched an intercontinental ballistic missile. It flew at an unprecedented altitude and was able to accurately land at any predetermined location on Earth.

On October 4, 1957, the Soviet Union launched the world's first artificial Earth satellite, opening a new era in human science.

Peace-loving people all over the world hailed this epoch-making scientific achievement of the Soviet Union, and hailed the realization of the first step of interstellar travel. But in the eyes of the US imperialists, this was a very troublesome thing. There was something flying over their heads that they could not drive away, could not stop, and could not take down, and it kept making "beep! beep!" sounds. How could this not make them sad, annoyed, and somewhat frightened? Arthur Clarke of Britain was right when he attended the International Astronautical Congress held in Barcelona, Spain: "From October 4th, the United States has become a second-rate country."

Two years ago, the United States had widely publicized its artificial Earth satellite program, the "Vanguard" program. But what stage has this program reached now? "Tool" tests are being conducted. The United States has twice tested the construction of the three-stage rocket that will take its artificial satellite into the sky, and conducted the third test on October 23. After this, four more tests will be needed before the United States can launch a formal artificial satellite.

What kind of artificial satellite is the United States hoping to launch next spring? According to the "Vanguard" program announced by the United States, its artificial satellite is about 50.8 centimeters in diameter, not much smaller than the Soviet artificial satellite, but it weighs only 9.77 kilograms, which is only about one-ninth of the weight of the Soviet artificial satellite. The difference in weight is of great significance. In military terms, this difference is the difference in the weight of the nuclear warhead that ballistic missiles with roughly equal ranges in the Soviet Union and the United States can carry. Therefore, what scientists in the United States and other Western countries are particularly surprised by is not the fact that the Soviet Union successfully launched an Earth satellite, but the weight of the satellite it launched.

The scientists and engineers who are currently preparing to launch the US artificial satellite into outer space admit that the "Vanguard" rocket cannot push a satellite as heavy as the one launched by the Soviet Union out of the Earth's atmosphere and into orbit.

From these facts, we can clearly see how far behind the United States is compared to the Soviet Union. No wonder Professor Teller, the father of the US hydrogen bomb, said in frustration: "Russia's scientific advantage in the next ten years is now irreversible." This irreversible advantage is not just for the next ten years, it will only become greater and greater, and it has become a permanent certainty.

Why can the scientific undertakings of the socialist country, the Soviet Union, advance so rapidly and achieve such amazing achievements? This is precisely because modern scientific and technological research requires the wisdom of the masses and the strength of the collective. Moreover, only in a socialist society that has eliminated the system of human exploitation can the wisdom and talents of the broad masses of workers, peasants, and intellectuals be fully utilized; and only under the leadership of the Communist Party is it possible to correctly concentrate the wisdom of the masses and perfectly organize scientific and technological forces.

The advancement of Soviet science and technology lies not only in the outstanding performance of a certain discipline, but in the equally superb performance of almost all the latest disciplines, which guarantees that the Soviet Union can be at the forefront of every major scientific progress. In our era, the progress of science and technology has become a very important part of the peaceful competition between the two systems of socialism and capitalism. In this peaceful competition, the socialist system will achieve more and more significant and greater victories. This is completely in line with the laws of development and is irresistible to the dying capitalist madmen. As Professor Joliot-Curie said, the increasing development of Soviet science is the law of development of the new society.

Due to the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system, the Soviet Union has achieved achievements that no country has ever achieved. The achievements of the Soviet Union, as always, serve the happiness of mankind and world peace. The Soviet Union is still a very young country, like the rising sun, shining brightly. Artificial Earth satellites are the precursors of even greater things in the future. Some of these things may not be fully realized until the whole world enters socialism, but due to the realization of these things, all the people of the world will inevitably enter socialism and the paradise of communist society more quickly.

The Chinese revolution is the continuation of the great October Revolution. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese people are advancing along the road of the October Revolution, have completed the task of socialist transformation ahead of schedule, and will overfulfill the first five-year plan for the development of the national economy. The face of our country has undergone fundamental changes, and scientific and cultural undertakings have also developed rapidly. Professor Joliot-Curie said: "In terms of scientific and technological achievements, the People's Republic of China and other socialist countries are rapidly catching up with the Soviet Union." This is a fact, and it is also his expectation of us. We have a superior socialist system, the strong leadership of the Party, the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union and other brotherly countries, coupled with the support of the people of the whole country and our own efforts, the glorious task assigned to us by the Party to bring our country's science and technology close to or reach the advanced world level by the end of the third five-year plan is completely achievable.

In commemorating the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution, Chinese scientific workers have more clearly realized that the socialist road that the Soviet Union has adhered to in construction is what we must follow; the complete and very rich advanced experience of the Soviet Union in building socialism is what we must seriously learn; the Bolshevik tenacity and loyalty of Soviet scientists, the proletarian world outlook, and the spirit of high patriotism and internationalism are the best examples for us to learn from. We must resolutely support the leadership of the Communist Party of China, resolutely support the superior socialist system, raise our ideological awareness, strengthen revolutionary practice, closely integrate with the workers and peasants, fundamentally transform our political stance, and strive to become intellectuals of the working class. Only in this way can we make due contributions to the socialist construction of the motherland. The Soviet intellectual circles are a large army of working-class intellectuals formed under the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Their contributions on all fronts of economic construction and cultural construction are an important guarantee for the Soviet Union to build a socialist society and a valuable asset for the progressive cause of mankind. They are a shining example for our country's intellectual circles.

    苏联先进的科学技术与社会制度
    严济慈
    伟大的十月社会主义革命扫除了科学与人民之间的隔阂，使科学与生活结合，使科学为建设服务，并且空前地为科学的繁荣和发展创造了完全新的、特别有利的条件。苏联在十月革命后短短四十年间，从一个经济落后的农业国一跃而为世界上拥有头等技术的最先进国家。这就充分说明了社会主义制度的无比优越性和马克思列宁主义的无限生命力。
    苏联人民在苏联共产党的英明领导下，从一个胜利走向另一个胜利，取得了人类有史以来无可比拟的巨大成就。苏联的整个生活也就是一连串被人们认为“不可能”的奇迹的不断实现。
    首先是工人阶级夺取和掌握政权，这是被社会主义敌人称为“不可能”的事。1918—1921年经过无数次挫折的对白卫分子和干涉者的斗争的胜利也是如此。
    反苏分子也十分肯定地认为重建百孔千疮的苏联工业和农业是不可能的事，后来又认为苏联没有能力管理它正在建立中的规模巨大的新工业。一个接着一个取得辉煌成就的五年计划受到了嘲笑，被认为只是宣传的把戏。被希特勒预计在六个星期内就可以打败的红军，却在消灭法西斯主义的罪恶滔天的军事机器这一战争中发挥了决定性的作用，并把许多国家的人民从法西斯奴役下拯救出来。苏联接着又使不可能的事情成为可能，迅速地治愈了第二次世界大战带来的严重创伤，并且获得了前所未有的发展。
    战后不久，1949年苏联又出现了“不可能”的事情，打破美帝国主义原子弹垄断的优势。美帝国主义者认为苏联要有一颗原子炸弹需要过二十年到四十年的时间，或者甚至更长的时间。事实上，苏联只落后于美国四年。1953年苏联进行了第一次氢弹爆炸，仅仅后于美国八个月，粉碎了美帝国主义征服世界的迷梦。
    从此以后，苏联领先了，惊人成就层出不穷。无可争辩地，苏联成为世界上在科学、技术和工程各方面最先进的国家。
    1954年6月27日，苏联宣布世界上第一个原子能发电站投入生产。在第六个五年计划里，苏联兴建的原子能发电站的功率就达二百万到二百五十万瓩。
    1956年3月23日，苏联的图—104喷气式客机以三个半小时的不着陆飞行，从莫斯科飞到伦敦。接着，苏联就把这种飞机用在商业航线上。
    1957年4月16日，苏联在莫斯科附近开始运转了世界上最大的同步稳相加速器，可使质子加速到一百亿电子伏特的能量。
    1957年8月26日，苏联成功地发射了洲际弹道导弹。它在空前未有的高度飞行，并且能够准确地落到地球上任何预定的地点。
    1957年10月4日，苏联发射出世界上第一颗人造地球卫星，开创了人类科学的新纪元。
    全世界爱好和平的人民都为苏联这一划时代的科学成就而欢呼，为星际交通的第一步实现而欢呼。但在美帝国主义者看来，这是一件非常令人头痛的事。在他们头顶上，有一种他们无法驱走、无法停止、无法弄下来的东西在那里飞行，还不断发出“噼！噼！”的声音。这怎能不叫他们伤心、恼怒、吓得有些魂不附体呢？英国阿瑟·克拉克出席在西班牙巴塞罗那召开的国际星际航行会议时说得对：“从10月4日起，美国已经成为第二流的国家了。”
    美国在两年以前就为它的人造地球卫星计划——“先锋”计划大吹大擂广事宣传了。但是，这个计划现在进行到什么地步呢？正在进行“工具”试验。美国曾经两次试验了将把它的人造卫星带到天空中去的三阶段的火箭的构造，10月23日进行了第三次试验。在这以后，还需要再进行四次试验，然后美国才能发射正式的人造卫星。
    美国希望明年春天才能发射的又是一颗怎么样的人造卫星呢？根据美国所宣布的“先锋”计划，它的人造卫星的直径约五十点八公分，比苏联的人造卫星小得不多，可是重量只有九点七十七公斤，只等于苏联的人造卫星重量的九分之一左右。重量的差别具有十分重大的意义。就军事方面来说，这种差别也就是苏美两国的航程大致相等的弹道导弹所能携带的原子核弹头的重量差别。所以美国和其它西方国家的科学家所特别感到惊奇的，倒不是苏联成功地发射出地球卫星这一事实，而是它所发射的卫星的重量。
      目前正在为把美国的人造卫星发射到外空去而进行准备工作的科学家和工程师们，承认“先锋”火箭是不能把一颗像苏联射出的那么重的卫星推出地球气层射入轨道的。
    从这些事实，我们可以清楚地看出美国落后于苏联多远的程度。难怪美国氢弹之父泰勒教授沮丧地说：“今后十年俄国在科学方面的优势现在已不可扭转”。这个不可扭转的优势，岂止今后十年而已，只会越来越大，已成永远的定局了。
    为什么社会主义国家苏联的科学事业能够如此突飞猛进，取得这样惊人的成就？这正是因为近代化的科学技术研究需要群众的智慧和集体的力量。并且，只有在消灭了人剥削人的制度的社会主义社会里，广大工人、农民和知识分子的聪明才智才获得了充分发挥的机会；也只有在共产党的领导下，才有可能正确地集中群众的智慧以及完善地组织科学技术力量。
    苏联科学技术的先进不在于仅仅某一学科的出类拔萃，而在于几乎所有最新学科的同样高超，这就保证了苏联在每一重大科学进程中都能走在最前列。在我们的时代里，科学和技术的进步成为社会主义与资本主义两个制度和平竞赛的极重要的组成部分。在这个和平竞赛中，社会主义制度将取得愈来愈显著、愈来愈伟大的胜利。这是完全合乎发展规律的，是垂死的资本主义狂人们所无法抗拒的。正如约里奥—居里教授所说的，苏联科学发展的日益增长是新社会的发展规律。
    由于社会主义制度的无比优越性，苏联已经取得了任何国家从来没有达到过的成就。苏联的成就，跟往常一样，都是为人类幸福和世界和平服务的。苏联还是一个很年轻的国家，有如旭日东升，光芒万丈。人造地球卫星就是未来的更加伟大的事物的先驱。其中某些事物或许要待全世界进入社会主义以后才能充分实现，但是由于这些事物的实现，全世界的所有人民也必将更快地进入社会主义、进入共产主义社会的大乐园。
    中国革命是伟大十月革命的继续。中国人民在中国共产党的领导下，沿着十月革命的道路前进，已经提前完成了社会主义改造的任务，并将超额完成发展国民经济的第一个五年计划。我们国家的面貌已经有了根本的改观，科学文化事业也有了迅速的发展。约里奥—居里教授说：“在科学和技术成就方面，中华人民共和国和其它社会主义国家正在紧跟着苏联之后飞速地前进。”这是事实，也是他对我们的期望。我们有优越的社会主义制度，有党的坚强领导，有苏联和其它兄弟国家的无私帮助，加上全国人民的支持和我们自己的努力，党所交给我们的在第三个五年计划末期使我国科学技术接近或赶上世界先进水平这一光荣任务是完全可以做到的。
    在纪念十月革命四十周年的时候，中国科学工作者更加明确地认识到：苏联在建设工作中所坚持的社会主义道路，是我们所必须遵循的；苏联建设社会主义的完整而又非常丰富的先进经验，是我们所必须认真学习的；苏联科学家那种布尔什维克的顽强和忠诚，无产阶级的世界观，以及高度的爱国主义和国际主义的精神，更是我们学习的最好榜样。我们一定要坚决地拥护中国共产党的领导，坚决地拥护优越的社会主义制度，提高思想觉悟，加强革命实践，密切与工农群众结合，从根本上改造政治立场，争取成为工人阶级的知识分子。只有这样，我们才能为祖国的社会主义建设作出应有的贡献。苏联知识界是在苏联共产党领导下形成的工人阶级知识分子的大军。他们在经济建设和文化建设各个战线上所作的贡献，是苏联建成社会主义社会的重要保证，是人类进步事业的宝贵财富。他们是我国知识界的光辉榜样。
