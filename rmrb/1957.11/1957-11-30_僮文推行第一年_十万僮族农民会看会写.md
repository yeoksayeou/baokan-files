Xinhua News Agency, 28th. In the first year of promoting the Zhuang script, more than 350,000 Zhuang farmers in Guangxi Province participated in Zhuang script literacy studies, and more than 100,000 people have emerged from illiteracy and can now read and write. In Yongning County, among the 11,560 people participating in the study, 7,652 can read Zhuang newspapers, use Zhuang script to keep diaries, record work points, and write folk songs. In Longping and Fengma townships of Tianyang County, 40% to 50% of the young and middle-aged agricultural cooperative members have learned Zhuang script. In Pingshan Township, Yishan County, more than 30 people in two pilot teaching classes have completed three farmer literacy textbooks in 340 hours. Now, they can not only read and write, but also teach others. Now, every village in this township has a Zhuang script class.

      In order to promote the Zhuang script at the grassroots level in rural areas, the Guangxi Zhuang Script Work Committee trained more than 28,000 Zhuang script promoters in April and May this year. They used various tools such as folk songs, big-character posters, and broadcasts to carry out extensive propaganda. At the same time, the Guangxi Nationalities Publishing House published more than 1.82 million copies of Zhuang script textbooks and popular Zhuang script readers this year, and the "Zhuang Script Newspaper" has a circulation of more than 14,000 copies per issue.

    僮文推行第一年
    十万僮族农民会看会写
    新华社28日讯　在推行僮文的第一年，广西省有三十五万多僮族农民参加了僮文扫盲学习，有十万多人脱离了文盲状态变成会看会写。在邕宁县，参加学习的一万一千五百六十人中，已有七千六百五十二人能够看僮文报，用僮文记日记、记工分和写山歌。田阳县隆平、凤马两乡的青壮年农业社社员，有40％到50％学会了僮文。宜山县坪山乡的两个试教班三十多人，用三百四十个小时学完了三本农民识字课本，现在不但能读能写，还能够教别人。现在这个乡已经是屯屯有僮文班了。
      为了在农村基层中推行僮文，广西僮文工作委员会在今年4、5月间曾训练了两万八千多名僮文推行人员。他们利用山歌、大字报、广播等各种工具，展开了广泛的宣传。同时，广西省民族出版社在今年出版了僮文课本和通俗的僮文读物一百八十二万多册，“僮文报”每期发行一万四千多份。
