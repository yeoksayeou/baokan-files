Xinhua News Agency, November 5th -- Yesterday, the largest park event in eight years began in the capital. 120,000 people spent the first day of the grand park celebration for the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution in the Beijing Working People's Cultural Palace, Zhongshan Park, Beihai Park, and Jingshan Park.

	The Beijing Working People's Cultural Palace was adorned like a fairyland with red flags, flowers, colored electric lights, and festive slogans, where thousands of workers and Soviet experts rejoiced together to their hearts' content yesterday evening.

	Everywhere, among the ancient cypress trees and in front of the grand halls, were wonderful performances. Famous Peking Opera actors Tan Fuying and Zhang Junqiu, Pingju Opera actress Li Yilan, and others gave brilliant performances for the park visitors. The Peacock Dance performed by the Central Song and Dance Troupe, which won a gold medal at the 6th World Festival of Youth and Students, was especially popular.

	Under the ancient cypress forest twinkling with colored lights, came the joyful voices of Soviet experts and their wives who were helping with the construction of the Beijing Wired Electrical Factory: "How beautiful, just like a fir tree festival." Tao Chengyan, a technician from this factory, invited the wife of expert Shilov to waltz in the Cultural Palace's dance hall. Tao Chengyan had received help from expert Shilov during her internship in the Soviet Union, and they had long established a close friendship. Soviet expert Smirnov said happily to people: "Although we are far away from our motherland, we feel like we are at home here."

	In the stadium, the volleyball match between the Soviet Embassy in China's men's volleyball team and the China Mars Sports Association team attracted many spectators.

	In Zhongshan Park, ten thousand colored lanterns shone brightly, and a continuous stream of park visitors passed through the "Defend Peace" archway, following the chrysanthemum-lined path to every corner of the park. In front of Laijin Yuxuan, a gong sounded, and eight girls in magnificent Tibetan costumes, with light steps and flowing sleeves, appeared before the audience. This was the ancient Tibetan court dance – Langma dance – performed by the Tibetan Military Region Art Troupe.

	The Hall of Earth and Grain shone with lights, and thousands of people began a grand festive dance party. They were citizens from the streets and alleys of Beijing, officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, and cadres of state organs. As people's enthusiasm for dancing grew, two young people supported Zhang Nanxian, an 84-year-old member of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, as he approached the dance circle. At this moment, Wu Yuzhang, vice president of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, arrived, nodded to the joyful people, and shook hands with the young people he knew to congratulate them.

	Beihai Park held a fireworks display. Seven thousand colorful river lanterns swayed in the wind on the vast lake. The golden, glittering dragon boat in the heart of the lake played the music "Moscow-Beijing." Festive fireworks rose from the lake, igniting a slogan composed of fire characters: "Long Live Sino-Soviet Friendship and Cooperation," reflected in the water. Cameramen from the Central Newsreel and Documentary Film Studio captured the moving scene of tens of thousands of people celebrating the festival in color film, preparing to send the most brilliant shots to Moscow.

	Yesterday during the daytime, Jingshan Park was filled with the laughter of children. This park was the venue for the children's park event. At eight o'clock in the morning, various artistic programs prepared for the children began. Acrobatics, circus, puppet shows, and shadow plays attracted many young viewers. Children happily played more than 30 kinds of games in six game areas, such as fishing, ring toss, and chicken laying eggs. Many children held candies, calendars, bookmarks, and other prizes won from participating in the games. The park event prepared 100,000 prizes for the children.

	Yesterday evening, the lights on Tiananmen Square and the surrounding tall buildings were all turned on, filling the capital's night scene with a festive atmosphere.

	The grand park event will continue for two more days.

    首都十二万人游园盛况空前
    新华社5日讯　5日，首都开始了八年来规模最大的一次游园会。十二万人在北京劳动人民文化宫、中山公园、北海公园和景山公园度过了庆祝十月革命四十周年盛大游园会的第一天。
    北京市劳动人民文化宫5日晚被红旗、鲜花、彩色电灯和节日标语打扮得如同仙境，成千上万的职工和苏联专家们一起尽情地欢乐。
    在古柏丛中、大殿门前，到处是精采的演出。著名的京剧演员谭富英、张君秋，评剧演员李忆兰等为游园的人们作了精采演出。中央歌舞团演出的荣获第六届世界青年与学生联欢节金质奖章的孔雀舞特别受到人们欢迎。
    在闪烁着彩色灯光的古柏林下，传来了帮助北京有线电厂建设的苏联专家和夫人欢乐的声音：“多么漂亮啊，像枞树节一样。”这个工厂的技术人员陶成燕邀请希洛夫专家的夫人，在文化园的舞池里跳起了华尔兹舞。陶成燕在苏联实习的时候，就得到过希洛夫专家的帮助，他们早已建立了亲密的友谊。苏联专家斯米尔诺夫愉快地对人说：“我们虽然远离祖国，可是在这里我们就像在家里一样。”
    在体育场里，苏联驻华大使馆男子排球队对中国火星体育协会队的排球比赛吸引了许多观众。
    中山公园里万盏彩灯齐明，游园的人流接连不断地穿过“保卫和平”牌坊，顺着菊花盛开的甬道通往公园的各个角落。来今雨轩前一声锣响，八个穿着藏族盛装的姑娘迈着轻盈的步伐，拂着长袖出现在观众面前，这是西藏军区文工团表演的西藏古老的宫廷舞蹈——朗玛舞。
    社稷坛上灯火辉煌，成千的人开始了盛大的节日舞会。他们是来自北京的大街小巷的市民，人民解放军的军官、士兵和国家机关干部。当人们舞兴正浓的时候，两个年轻人扶着八十四岁的全国人民代表大会常委会委员张难先，走近了舞圈。这时，中苏友好协会总会副会长吴玉章来了，他向欢乐的人们点头示意，同相识的青年人握手祝贺。
    北海公园今晚举行了焰火大会。七千盏五色河灯在广阔的湖面上随风荡漾。湖心金光闪闪的龙船奏出了“莫斯科—北京”的乐曲。节日的焰火由湖面凌空而起，燃放出火字组成的“中苏友好合作万岁”的标语，倒映在水中。中央新闻纪录电影制片厂的摄影师们把这里的万人欢庆佳节的感人情景摄成彩色影片，准备选择最精采的镜头送往莫斯科去。
    5日白天，景山公园是一片孩子们的欢笑声。这个公园是少年儿童游园会的场所。早晨八点钟，为孩子们准备的各种文艺节目开始了。杂技、马戏、木偶戏、皮影吸引了许多小观众。少年儿童们在六个游戏区里兴高采烈地玩着钓鱼、套圈、母鸡下蛋等三十多种游戏。许多孩子的手里拿着糖果、日历、书签等参加游戏得来的奖品。游园会为孩子们准备了十万份奖品。
    5日晚，天安门和周围高大建筑物上的电灯一齐开放，首都的夜景已充满了节日的气氛。
    盛大的游园会将继续举行两天。
