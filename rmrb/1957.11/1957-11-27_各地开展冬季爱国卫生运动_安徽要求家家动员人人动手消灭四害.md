    Winter Patriotic Health Campaign Launched Across Various Regions
    Anhui Calls for Every Household and Individual to Eliminate the Four Pests
    (From Our Newspaper) Recently, many provinces (autonomous regions) and cities, including Shanxi, Shandong, Anhui, Sichuan, Zhejiang, Hunan, Xinjiang, Beijing, Tianjin, and Lanzhou, are actively planning and launching the winter Patriotic Health Campaign.
    In carrying out the Patriotic Health Campaign, all regions have clearly stated that eliminating the four pests is one of the central components. Shanxi Province is preparing to launch a high tide of sparrow eradication after the first snowfall, and will vigorously promote Xue Huiyi, the model rat exterminator from Jishan County, throughout the province, and launch a rat extermination campaign. Shandong Province is currently focusing on eliminating overwintering mosquitoes and flies, and will later launch a concentrated campaign to eliminate rats and sparrows. Anhui Province plans to carry out three sanitary assault campaigns this winter and next spring to eliminate the four pests. Currently, the first sanitary assault month is underway, focusing on eliminating overwintering mosquitoes and flies, and combining this with the elimination of rats and sparrows. Xinjiang is mobilizing young people in agricultural and pastoral areas to actively participate in eliminating the four pests, and will launch a campaign to "eliminate sparrows and rats, and kill wolves and eliminate pests" in agricultural and pastoral areas. Zhejiang, Hunan, as well as Tianjin, Qingdao, Chengdu, Chongqing and other provinces and cities have also made specific arrangements. Since Chengdu launched the elimination of the four pests on the 15th, the city has eliminated more than 400 sparrows, captured more than 2,400 rats, and eliminated more than 90,000 mosquitoes and flies in three days.
    Many provinces and cities also regard the prevention of winter and spring diseases as one of the central contents of the Patriotic Health Campaign. For example, Zhejiang, Shandong, Shanxi and other provinces have requested that while eliminating the four pests, work should be done to prevent and control seasonal and infectious diseases such as influenza, epidemic cerebrospinal meningitis, diphtheria, measles, pertussis, and scarlet fever.
    Shanxi, Shandong, Hunan and other provinces have also requested that all regions, during the winter Patriotic Health Campaign, extensively remove accumulated garbage, feces, and sludge, and combine this with accumulating fertilizer to improve environmental sanitation.
    (From Our Newspaper) Anhui has launched a Patriotic Health Campaign centered on eliminating the four pests. The first secretaries of the Hefei and Bengbu Municipal Party Committees and responsible cadres of some units personally participated in and took charge of the mobilization and command of the four pests elimination work. Since the launch of the campaign, Hefei has eliminated more than 23,000 sparrows and rats in just over ten days. Bengbu has also annihilated more than 600,000 mosquitoes and flies, more than 56,000 rats and sparrows, dug up more than 1,000 catties of maggots and pupae, and dredged more than 90 ditches totaling more than 1,800 meters in length. More than 200 students from Wangxiang Elementary School in Huainan City eliminated more than 9,000 rats in ten days. Caolaoji Township in Huaiyuan County carried out rat catching, sparrow extermination, and maggot and pupae elimination while digging ponds, cleaning up garbage, and accumulating fertilizer. In order to do this work well, the township, agricultural cooperatives, and production teams have established special assault teams responsible for accumulating fertilizer and eliminating the four pests, and each member household has also been assigned tasks for accumulating fertilizer and eliminating the four pests.
    Recently, the Anhui Provincial People's Committee decided: This winter and next spring, three Patriotic Health Campaigns centered on eliminating the four pests will be carried out throughout the province, requiring the urban areas of Hefei, Bengbu, Wuhu, Anqing, and Tunxi, Tianjia'an in Huainan, and key areas controlled by some rural areas to achieve the basic elimination of overwintering adult mosquitoes, adult flies, and fly pupae. Other regions are required to achieve mobilization of every household and individual to eliminate the four pests. (Yu Feng) (Attached picture)

    各地开展冬季爱国卫生运动
    安徽要求家家动员人人动手消灭四害
    本报讯　最近，山西、山东、安徽、四川、浙江、湖南、新疆和北京、天津、兰州等许多省（自治区）市，正积极布置和开展冬季爱国卫生运动。
    各地在开展爱国卫生运动中，都明确地提出以除四害为中心内容之一。山西省准备在下雪以后就掀起一个灭雀高潮，并且在全省范围内大力推广稷山县灭鼠模范薛回义的灭鼠经验，开展灭鼠运动。山东省目前正集中消灭越冬蚊蝇，以后再发动一次消灭鼠、雀的突击运动。安徽省准备在今冬明春开展三次卫生突击运动，消灭四害，目前正开展第一次卫生突击月，着重消灭越冬蚊、蝇，并且结合消灭鼠雀。新疆正发动农牧区青年积极参加除四害，将在农牧区掀起一个“消灭麻雀、老鼠，打狼除害”的运动。浙江、湖南以及天津、青岛、成都、重庆等省市也作了具体的布置，成都市自15日开展除四害以后，三天内全市共灭雀四百多只，捕鼠二千四百多只，蚊蝇九万多只。
    许多省市还把预防冬春季疾病作为爱国卫生运动中心内容之一。如浙江、山东、山西等省都要求在消灭四害的同时，作好防治流行性感冒、流行性脑脊髓膜炎、白喉、麻疹、百日咳、猩红热等季节性多发病和传染病的工作。
    山西、山东、湖南等省还要求各地在冬季爱国卫生运动中，大量清除积存垃圾、粪便、污泥，结合积肥改善环境卫生。
    本报讯　安徽各地已展开了一个以除四害为中心的爱国卫生运动。合肥、蚌埠市委第一书记和一些单位的负责干部都亲自参加和担任了除四害的动员和指挥工作。运动开展以来，十几天内，合肥市就消灭了麻雀、老鼠二万三千多只。蚌埠市也歼灭蚊、蝇六十多万只，老鼠、麻雀五万六千多只，挖蛆蛹一千多斤，疏通长一千八百多公尺的沟渠九十多条。淮南市王巷小学的二百多个学生在十天内就消灭老鼠九千多只。怀远县曹老集乡在挖塘、打扫垃圾、积肥的同时进行了捕鼠、灭雀和消灭蛆蛹。为了做好这项工作，乡、农业社和生产队都专门成立了突击小组，负责积肥和除四害，每户社员也分配了积肥、除四害的任务。
    最近安徽省人民委员会决定：今冬明春在全省开展三次以除四害为中心的爱国卫生运动，要求合肥、蚌埠、芜湖、安庆市和屯溪市的市区、淮南市的田家庵，以及部分农村所掌握的重点区，达到基本消灭越冬成蚊、成蝇和蝇蛹。其他地区要求达到家家动员，人人动手，消灭四害。（于风）（附图片）
