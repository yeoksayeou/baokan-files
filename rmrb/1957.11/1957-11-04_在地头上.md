Everywhere, across the mountains and plains, are crowds of people helping farmers fight the drought and plant wheat. Among them are department directors, bureau chiefs, section heads, engineering technicians... men and women, old and young, outsiders who can't distinguish the five grains, and experts who have wielded hoes before. Everyone is determined: we must help the farmers plant wheat before the frost falls.

The production team leader assigned our group the task of breaking up clods. Before we started, the team leader explained the significance of the task to us. He said, "Why do we have to break up the clods? Because only by breaking up the clods can we dig ditches, only by digging ditches can we plant wheat, only by planting wheat can we water it, and only by watering it can the wheat grow. Otherwise—" he waved his hand and said, "It's like a blind man lighting a lamp, a waste of a candle. That is to say, if you don't break up the clods, the wheat won't grow!" Hearing this, we looked at each other and smiled knowingly.

The team leader left us with a technical guide, "If you have any questions about how to do it, ask him." As he spoke, he pointed to an old commune member with a white beard and a slightly hunched back standing on the edge of the field. The old commune member nodded, glanced at everyone, and smiled, meaning: that's me.

After the team leader left, the technical guide—the old commune member—showed us how to break up the clods and how to save energy with gestures. When everyone started working, he calmly rolled up his sleeves, took off his shoes, placed them on the edge of the field, and, with his bare, dry, large feet, joined us. Initially, the old commune member kept pace with everyone, but gradually he took the lead. Several of us young men refused to be outdone and secretly discussed, "Catch up!" So, without looking up, without straightening our backs, without wiping our sweat, we worked desperately, with the strength of oxen, and finally caught up. We breathed a long sigh of relief. The old commune member looked at us kindly and said with a smile, "Young men, not bad! But you can't work too hard at once, you should use steady strength. Otherwise, you won't last. It's only the beginning of the day!"

During the break, several of us sat down in a circle around the old commune member. The old commune member took out his dry tobacco pipe, filled it with tobacco, and offered it to us. We said we didn't know how to smoke, so he lit it and puffed away contentedly.

"Grandpa, how old are you?" I asked.

"Oh!" The old commune member smiled, pinched three fingers together, and said, "This number."

"Seventy? You should rest!"

"Oh, I'm not used to being idle. The commune also asked me to retire—as a 'Five Guarantee Household,' but I have a problem, I get sick if I don't work. In the past, when I worked for the landlord, I always tried to slack off, but now I'm addicted to working for myself!"

"Comrades," the old commune member stood up, shading his eyes with his hand, looking at the vast plain, and said reminiscently, "If it weren't for the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, this old bone of mine would have been fed to the dogs long ago. I'm over sixty years old, and only now do I feel like I have a future. Look!" He pointed to a row of tile-roofed houses in the village, "See, that's where I used to work and suffer. Now it's my home. After the land reform, the house was given to me. Now I have food, clothing, and shelter. It makes me want to laugh when I think about it; but when I think about the suffering I endured in the past, my nose stings—I want to cry. It's really too much to tell!" The old commune member immediately stopped smiling, his voice low and slow as he thought and said, "In that world, we ate pig and dog food and did the work of oxen and horses! In the depths of winter, we had no cotton quilt, only a hemp sack to cover ourselves. We slept in the landlord's cowshed. What did we do when we were cold? We put a door panel on top... The landlord wore a sheepskin coat and said leisurely, 'You can sleep with the dog, it's warm!' He didn't treat us like human beings! What, I heard some time ago that right-wingers in the newspapers said that things are not as good now as they were in the past?" We nodded.

"Hmph! That's nonsense! What's not as good as the past?" At this point, the old commune member was furious, and he banged the ground with his pipe and said loudly, "It's just that those people in the tile-roofed houses can no longer ride on our heads and shit!"

"Look how fat our commune's livestock is!" Following the old commune member's gesture, we saw a pair of oxen and donkeys, fat as if molded from clay, resting under the willow trees. "This is a sign of prosperous livestock!"

We told him that a right-winger in the government office said that the livestock in the cooperative were as thin as skeletons. He laughed heartily when he heard this, "Let him come and see, is there such a skeleton?"

"Speaking of you," the old commune member turned back to the main topic, "In the old days, you couldn't be invited even with an eight-man sedan. Don't mention the provincial governor helping to plant wheat, even ordinary officials would pinch their noses when they saw us common people, because they thought we were dirty and smelly. But now things are different. We're like one big family, hehe." The old man laughed heartily again, "The other day, a department director even helped us spread manure by hand!?" He seemed to remember something, looking at the sky, "Chairman Mao really thought things through, just when the farmers were short of hands, he sent people, which is like sending charcoal in the snow, very timely."

I don't know what happened, but after listening to the old commune member's talk, we were immediately filled with energy, and the shadow of fatigue was swept away. I don't know who took the lead, but we took off our shoes and socks, rolled up our trouser legs, exposed our white feet, and started working like the old commune member.

The old commune member looked at us like this, stroking his beard, both happy and unwilling, and shouted, "Take care of yourselves, don't get too tired..."

The reply to him was the even more intense sound of hoes breaking up the clods.

    在地头上
    朱钧
    满山遍野是帮助农民抗旱种麦的人群，其中有厅长、局长、处长，有工程技术人员……有男有女，有老有少，有五谷不分的门外汉，也有曾经摸过锄头的行家。大家下了决心：一定在霜降前给农民种上麦子。
    生产队长分配给我们这伙的任务是：砸坷垃。没动手之前，队长先给我们讲了讲任务的意义。他说：“为什么要砸碎坷垃？因为砸碎坷垃才能挖沟，挖了沟才能种麦子，种上麦才能浇水，浇上水麦子才能出来，不的话——”他用手一挥，说：“那是瞎子点灯，白搭一支蜡，也就是说，不打碎坷垃，麦子出不来！”大伙一听，你看看我，我看看你，会心地笑了笑。
    队长给我们留下了个技术指导，“你们怎样干，就问他。”说着用手指了指站在地头上的一个白胡子、背有些弓的老社员，老社员点了点头，向大伙扫了一眼，笑了笑，意思是：就是我。
    队长走后，技术指导——老社员就用手比量着教我们怎样砸，怎样省劲。等大家干起来，他也不慌不忙的挽上袖子，把鞋一脱，放在地头上，赤着两只干巴巴的大脚鸭子，也随我们干了起来，起初老社员和大伙齐头并进，但渐渐地他一马当先了。我们几个小伙子不服输，暗暗地商量了商量：“撵”！于是，我们头也不抬，腰也不伸，汗也不擦，拚命地干了起来，一股牛劲，终于赶上了，我们长长出了口气。老社员却慈祥地看着我们笑着说：“小伙子不赖！可是不能够猛干，应该使匀劲，不的话，你们称不了。现在一天才露头呢！”
    休息了，我们几个人团团地围着老社员坐了下来，老社员掏出旱烟袋，装上烟让我们吸，我们说不会，于是他燃着独自巴答巴答的吸了起来。
      “老爷爷你多大高寿？”我问。
      “哦！”老社员笑了笑，用三个手
    指头捏在一起说：“这个数。”
    “七十？该休息了！”
    “咳，闲不惯，社里也让我休息——当五保户，可是我有个毛病，不干活就生病，过去给地主扛活尽想磨滑，现在给自己干活倒有了瘾！”
    “同志”，老社员站起来，用手打着眼罩，望着一漫平川的土地，回忆似的说：“要不是共产党毛主席，咱这块老骨头早喂狗了，活到六十多岁，今儿个才觉得有了奔头，你们看！”他指着村子里一片瓦房，“瞧，那是过去俺扛活受苦的地方，如今是俺的家，土改后，把房子分给了俺，眼下有吃有穿有住，想起来就想笑；可是，提起过去遭的罪，鼻子就酸——想流泪，真是多得一火车也拉不完唉！”老社员顿时收起笑容，声音低沉而缓慢地边想边说：“那个世道，吃的是猪狗饭，出的是牛马力呵！十冬腊月没棉被盖，只盖一条麻袋片，睡在地主牛棚里，冷啦咋办？上边压上一块门板……地主穿着小羊毛皮袄还乐悠悠地说：‘你和狗睡在一齐吧，狗身上发暖哩！’他不拿着咱当人待呵！怎么，听说前些时报上右派分子说现今不如过去？”我们点点头。
      “哼！那是放屁！什么不如过去？”这时老社员气呼呼地，用烟袋锅敲着地大声说：“那就是那些瓦房子的人再不能骑在咱头上屙屎了！”
    “你看咱社的牲口多胖！”顺着老社员的指点，只见一对胖得像泥捏的似的一对牛驴，在柳树下息晌。“这是人畜兴旺！”
    我们告诉他机关上有个右派分子说合作社的牲口瘦成框子，他听了哈哈地大笑起来了：“让他来看看嘛，还有这样的框子？”
    “就说你们”，老社员又转了正题：“在旧世道用八抬轿请也请不来，甭说省长来帮助种麦子，就是一般小官，见了老百姓也得捏着鼻子走，嫌咱脏、有味，可是现在世道不同了，咱们像一大家子人，嘿嘿”。说着老人又爽快的笑出声来：“那天，一个厅长还用手帮咱撒粪呢！?！”他像想起了什么，脸看着天上：“毛主席想的真周到，庄稼人正少人手的时候，他派人来了，这叫雪里送炭，再及时不过了。”
    不知咋搞的，我们听了老社员的谈话，顿时，身上充满了劲，疲劳的影子一扫而光，不知谁引头，把鞋、袜也脱下来了，挽上裤腿角子，露出两个白脚鸭子，学着老社员的样子干了起来。
    老社员看着我们这个样子，摸着胡子，又高兴又舍不得地咋呼开了：“爱惜着身子点，别累坏了……”
    答复他的是更紧张的砸坷垃的镢头声。
