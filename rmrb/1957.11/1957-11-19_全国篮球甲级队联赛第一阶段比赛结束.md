Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 18th – The first stage of the 1957 National Basketball League A, after three days of intense competition, concluded the group matches on the 17th.

　　From the 18th onwards, the top two teams from each of the three groups, for both men and women, totaling six teams each, will engage in a round-robin tournament to compete for the top six positions. The teams that secured the third and fourth positions in each group will also participate in a round-robin tournament to contend for positions below sixth place.

　　The Beijing team in Men’s Group Three, after defeating the China Power Sports Association team on the 17th with a score of 85-57, secured the first place in this group with three consecutive victories. The Shanghai Red team defeated the PLA Guangzhou Garrison team with a score of 92-70, securing the second place in the third group.

　　The PLA "August 1st" Red team secured the first place in Men's Group Two. This team defeated the strong Tianjin team on the 17th with a score of 79-72. The PLA Shenyang Garrison team secured the second place in this group, defeating the Chengdu team on the 17th with a score of 74-59.

　　The PLA "August 1st" Yellow team and the Shenyang team secured the top two positions in the first group. These two teams defeated the PLA Beijing Garrison team and the Shanghai White team on the 17th with scores of 73-64 and 53-48 respectively.

　　In the Women's Group, the Shanghai team defeated the Guangzhou team on the 17th with a score of 62-48, securing the first place in the first group. The Guangzhou team secured second place with two wins and one loss.

　　The PLA "August 1st" team also achieved its third victory on the 17th, defeating the Chongqing team with a score of 68-50, securing the first place in the second group. Although the Wuhan team in this group lost to the China Coal Mine Sports Association team on the 17th with a score of 55-57, with Chongqing and the Coal Mine Sports Association team also having one win and two losses, the Wuhan team had previously defeated the Chongqing team with a score of 57-52, and the Chongqing team had defeated the Coal Mine Sports Association team with a score of 52-48, and the point difference in the Coal Mine Sports Association team's victory over the Wuhan team on the 17th did not exceed five points, so the Wuhan team still secured the second place in the group.

　　In the third group, the Beijing team defeated the Jiangsu team on the 17th with a score of 78-29, securing the first place in the group; the Chengdu team secured second place. They had previously defeated the Jiangsu team on the 15th with a score of 83-45.

    全国篮球甲级队联赛第一阶段比赛结束
    新华社广州18日电　1957年全国篮球甲级队联赛经过三天紧张激烈的比赛后，第一阶段的分组比赛已经在17日结束。
    从18日起，获得男女各三个分组前两名的各六个队，将展开争夺前六名名次的循环赛。获得各分组第三、四名的队，也将展开争夺第六名以下名次的循环赛。
    男子第三组的北京队17日以八十五比五十七击败了中国动力体育协会队后，以连胜三场的成绩取得了这一分组的第一名。上海红队以九十二比七十胜中国人民解放军驻广州部队队，得到第三分组的第二名。
    男子第二分组的第一名是中国人民解放军“八一”红队，这个队17日以七十九比七十二胜实力很强的天津队。在这个组的第二名是中国人民解放军驻沈阳部队队，他们17日以七十四比五十九胜成都队。
    中国人民解放军“八一”黄队和沈阳队获得了第一分组的头两名。这两个队17日分别以七十三比六十四、五十三比四十八战胜了中国人民解放军驻北京部队队和上海白队。
    女子组的上海队17日以六十二比四十八打败了广州队，得到第一分组的第一名，广州队二胜一败得第二。
    中国人民解放军“八一”队17日也取得了第三场胜利，以六十八比五十击败了重庆队，为第二组的第一名。这一组的武汉队17日虽然以五十五比五十七败给了中国煤矿体育协会队，同重庆和煤矿体育协会队都是一胜二负，但由于武汉队曾以五十七比五十二击败重庆队，重庆市队则以五十二比四十八击败煤矿体育协会队，而17日煤矿体育协会队胜武汉市队的积分差数没能超过五分，因此武汉队仍然获得分组的第二名。
    在第三分组的北京队17日以七十八比二十九胜江苏队，得分组第一；成都队得第二。她们15日曾经以八十三比四十五胜江苏省队。
