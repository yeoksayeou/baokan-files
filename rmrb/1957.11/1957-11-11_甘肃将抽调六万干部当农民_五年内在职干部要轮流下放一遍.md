    Gansu to Transfer 60,000 Cadres to Become Peasants
    All On-the-Job Cadres to be Rotated Downward Once Within Five Years
    (Our report) In accordance with the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Standing Committee of the Gansu Provincial Party Committee recently studied the issues of streamlining institutions throughout the province and rotating on-the-job cadres to participate in labor production. It requires that 60,000 cadres throughout the province return to their hometowns before February next year to engage in agricultural production and build a new socialist countryside.
    The Provincial Party Committee decided that all units should continue to vigorously streamline institutions based on the 1957 staffing levels, and resolutely cut and merge unnecessary and overlapping institutions. Based on the 1957 staffing levels, Party and government agencies and people's organizations should be streamlined by at least another 15%; the number of professional personnel in institutions should also be greatly reduced; non-production personnel and non-professional personnel in commercial enterprises should be controlled below 12% of the total number of employees, and in industrial and mining enterprises should be controlled below 10%; state-owned farms should be controlled below 2%. Fulfilling this requirement will allow the province to reduce the number of people by more than 40,000 in 1958 (excluding state-owned factories and mines), saving the state more than 28 million yuan in wages alone per year. In order to enable the transferred cadres to participate in production as soon as possible, all units should begin to reduce staffing during the current rectification. The work of streamlining institutions throughout the province should be basically completed by the end of December 1957, and more than half of the transferred personnel should be processed before the end of the year, most of the remaining personnel should be processed in January next year, and the remaining part should be completed by the end of February.
    The Standing Committee also decided that on-the-job cadres after the streamlining of institutions should be systematically and in batches rotated downward to the grassroots level and into production, in order to gain grassroots work experience and labor production training. All on-the-job cadres, except for those with special reasons, should generally go to the grassroots level, to the countryside, and to the factories to work for one year, one and a half to two years, or to work for several years, so that each cadre can be tested by actual struggle and acquire practical production knowledge. All units should rank names, make plans, and after fully carrying out political and ideological work, strive to send down the first batch of personnel who should be sent down before the spring plowing next year.

    甘肃将抽调六万干部当农民
    五年内在职干部要轮流下放一遍
    本报讯　根据中共八届三中全会的精神，中共甘肃省委常委会议最近研究了全省紧缩机构问题和在职干部轮流下放参加劳动生产的问题。要求全省在明年2月以前有六万名干部回乡从事农业生产，建设社会主义的新农村。
    省委决定，各单位应在1957年的编制基础上，继续大力进行紧缩机构，并坚决地裁减合并那些不必要的和重叠的机构。按1957年编制，党政机关和人民团体最低还应紧缩15％；事业单位的业务人员也应大力缩减；非生产人员和非业务人员，商业企业应控制在职工总数的12％以下，工矿企业应控制在10％以下；国营农场应控制在2％以下。完成这个要求，1958年全省约可再减少四万多人（不包括国营厂矿），仅工资开支一项，一年就可为国家节约两千八百余万元。为使被抽调的干部及早参加生产，各单位在目前整改中即应开始缩减。全省的紧缩机构工作应争取1957年12月底基本结束，被抽调的人员应在年底以前处理一半以上，其余人员明年1月处理大部分，剩余部分2月底处理完毕。
    常委会还决定：紧缩机构以后的在职干部，要有计划地、分批地轮流下放到基层去，到生产中去，以便取得基层工作经验和劳动生产的锻炼。所有的在职干部，除有特殊原因者外，一般都要到基层去，到农村去，到工厂去工作一年、一年半到二年或者劳动几年，使每个干部都能受到实际斗争的考验，取得生产实践知识。各单位应排名单，做计划，在充分做好政治思想工作之后，争取于明年春耕前，将应该下放的第一批人员都放下去。
