Tangxi Township, Minqing County, Fujian Province, properly arranged literacy work while carrying out the rural socialist great debate, consolidating and developing the people's schools.

Since last winter, the township has established seven people's schools and eleven study groups, with 532 students. Initially, the students were highly motivated to learn. However, after the summer harvest, township and commune cadres were busy leading production and drought resistance work, relaxing their leadership over the people's schools. By early September, only 104 students in the entire township persisted in their studies. At that time, the countryside was initially launching the great blooming and contending, and many cadres, especially the people's school teachers, felt they had no time to lead and advocated closing the people's schools. In response to this situation, the Party branch, at a meeting to study the launch of the great debate, proposed to Party members and commune cadres that the people's schools should be consolidated and developed through the great debate. At the same time, they guided everyone to recognize that as long as time was arranged reasonably, the people's schools could not only continue to operate but also serve the great debate.

At the beginning of the great debate, in addition to paying attention to the guiding role of the township and commune great debate leadership organization's guiding groups and central groups, the Party branch also arranged the work of the people's schools on the agenda of the great debate. The propaganda committee member of the branch was assigned to cooperate with the deputy directors of each agricultural cooperative to check and supervise. Representatives of the people's school teachers and core members of the students were generally absorbed into various meetings held in the township, enabling them to understand the important significance and policies of the current movement, improve their ideological understanding, and make the people's school teachers and students the propagandists and backbone forces of the great debate. At the same time, political classes in the people's schools were restored, and the central content of the debate was used as the content of the political classes. Party and Communist Youth League secretaries and comrades from the township and commune work groups were also invited to serve as political teachers, carrying out socialist ideological education for the peasants through political classes to promote the development of the great debate. In order to adapt to the development of the people's schools and the needs of decentralized group learning during the great debate, reasonable adjustments were made to the debate groups lacking people's school teachers, so as to achieve "every group has a people's teacher, and someone teaches every night."

In order to ensure that neither learning nor debate was delayed, the township adopted the method of "study first, then meet" to arrange debate and study time, and determined the length of pre-meeting study time according to the specific circumstances of each debate meeting. Necessary changes were also made to the content of learning, and various materials such as mountain songs, ditties, and clapper talks were compiled and printed for the masses to learn. For example, in the early stage of blooming and contending, in order to dispel the masses' ideological concerns, the words "Stand firm, put aside ideological concerns, and bravely and boldly speak out from the bottom of your heart..." were written and taught to the students to recite. Because the words taught were combined with reality, the masses were more focused when recognizing the words, recognized the words quickly, and their enthusiasm for learning and debate was very high. Now, 33 new study groups have been developed throughout the township, and the number of students has increased rapidly from the original 104 to 792. Commune members all said: "Through the great debate, we understood the principles, and we also recognized the words. It is truly a triple promotion of production, debate, and learning."

    在大辩论中的塘西乡民校
    福建省闽清县塘西乡在开展农村社会主义大辩论时，妥善安排了扫盲工作，使民校得到巩固和发展。
    去冬以来，该乡共办了七所民校和十一个学习小组，学员五百三十二人。开始学员们的学习情绪很高，但是夏收后，由于乡、社干部忙于领导生产和抗旱工作，放松了对民校工作的领导，到9月上旬，全乡坚持下来的学员仅有一百零四人。当时农村正在初步开展大鸣大放，许多干部特别是民校教师，都认为没有时间领导，主张停办民校。根据这种情况，党支部在召开研究开展大辩论的会上，向党员和社干部们提出要使民校通过大辩论得到巩固和发展，同时引导大家认识到只要合理地安排时间，民校不但能办下去，而且可以为大辩论服务。
    大辩论一开始，党支部除了注意发挥乡、社大辩论领导机构的指导小组和中心小组的作用外，并且把民校工作也安排在大辩论日程上，指定支部宣传委员负责配合各农业社副社长检查督促。乡里召开各种会议，一般都吸收民校教师代表和学员骨干参加，使他们了解当前运动的重要意义和政策，提高思想认识，使民校师生成为大辩论的宣传员和骨干力量。同时恢复了民校政治课，并把辩论的中心内容作为政治课的内容，还邀请了党、团支书和驻乡、社工作组的同志担任政治教师，通过政治课向农民进行社会主义思想教育，来推动大辩论的开展。为了适应民校的发展和大辩论时期分散小组学习的需要，对缺乏民校教师的辩论小组，进行了合理调配，做到“组组有民师，夜夜有人教”。
    为了使学习、辩论都不误，该乡采取了“先学习，后开会”的办法来安排辩论和学习时间，并根据每次辩论会的具体情况，确定会前学习时间的长短。在学习内容上也作了必要的改变，编印了多种多样的山歌、小调、快板等材料，发给群众学习。如鸣放初期，为了解除群众思想顾虑，就把“站稳立场，放下思想顾虑，勇敢而大胆地讲出心底话……”这些字写好教学员念。由于教的字结合了实际，群众认起字来注意力就比较集中，识字也快，学习和辩论的情绪都很高。现在全乡新发展了三十三个学习小组，入学人数迅速增加，由原有一百零四人，增到七百九十二人。社员们都说：“通过大辩论，懂得了道理，又认识了字，真是生产、辩论、学习三推动。”
