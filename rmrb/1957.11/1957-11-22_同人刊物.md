    "Fellow Traveler Publications"
    Wu Boxiao
    Among the bourgeois rightists, running "fellow traveler publications" or "fellow traveler newspapers" seems to be a very fashionable game. This is a conspiratorial activity by which they branch off from the socialist ranks, attempting to split the people's literary and journalistic endeavors.
    In fact, the term "fellow traveler" attached to a publication immediately suggests the smell of guild or gang. They are "fellow travelers," and others are naturally "outsiders." If those outside the "fellow travelers" are the majority, the broad masses of the people, then the "fellow travelers" are alienating themselves from the people, or even cutting themselves off from the people. In a new society where the people are the masters of their own house, who can imagine that a "fellow traveler publication" that alienates itself from the people or cuts itself off from the people can do anything beneficial for the people? The shout of "We are a gang" or "We are a small family" reveals utter selfishness.
    In the old society where the exploiting class ruled the working people, the ideology of the ruling class was often the ruling ideology, and the true voice of the people had no way to be published in official publications. If a few people united to run fellow traveler publications, in order to show a clear banner, like a ray of sunlight piercing through thick clouds, like a light lit in the dark night, daring to violate the ruling ideology, to mark out independent propositions, to say what others did not dare to say, to tell the truth that oppressors did not allow to be told, thereby opening the eyes of the ignorant, awakening the sleeping people, and calling on everyone to fight and advance, such publications were undoubtedly progressive. Such "fellow travelers" were progressive and revolutionary.
    However, in a socialist society, the public ownership of the means of production has replaced private ownership. In order to create collective happiness and strike at the common enemies that may still exist, what people demand is a unified will and unified action. A hundred flowers can bloom together, but a hundred flowers should be fragrant flowers, blooming for 600 million people to see. A hundred schools of thought can contend, but a hundred schools should contend for truth, resounding for 600 million people to hear. If at this time, a small handful of people calling themselves "fellow travelers" insist on being the one hundred and first school, disrupting the harmony of the chorus, singing off-key and against the tune, disrupting the pace of progress, retreating or acting recklessly, what good will it do for the people's cause? Fencing off a garden, only allowing "fellow travelers" to cultivate and plant there, admiring themselves in isolation, they can have freedom, but if the secretly made goods are to be sold, and the publications are to find readers, then where do they want to lead the patrons? People have already experienced this kind of "fellow traveler publication," the looming shadows of "July" and "Hope" are not far past.
    Around 1920, there were so-called "fellow traveler" writers in the Soviet Union, represented by the literary group "Serapion Brothers." Perhaps the planners of the "fellow traveler publications" wanted to learn from them? But the "fellow traveler" writers eventually split up. Do our "fellow travelers" feel satisfied with being this kind of "fellow traveler"? But according to the already known list of "fellow travelers," there are quite a few Communist Party members inside!
    Perhaps the people who are planning "fellow traveler publications" will say that they only want to create a different genre in the people's literature, with unique colors in writing styles and articles, as one of the hundred flowers, one vein of the hundred schools. But, "fellow traveler publications founded on the common basis of socialist ideology for the development of literary styles and genres" (note) are precisely what our Party approves of, advocates, and welcomes. Why do these "fellow travelers" not openly advocate this, competing in beauty and fragrance in the garden of art with thousands of purples and reds, but instead carry it out secretly, hiding it from the organization, as if there is some unspeakable privacy? And they put forward the slogan: "No interference whatsoever"? What is strange is that, examining the ranks of these "fellow travelers," whether they are theorists, critics, or novelists, poets, whether they are appointed editors or reserved contributors, almost all of them are figures famous on the rightist list. Don't they want to completely reject the leadership of the Party and run them as bourgeois-style "free forums"? Birds of a feather flock together, and things are grouped by categories. This is not accidental.
    Fortunately, "fellow traveler publications" and "fellow traveler newspapers" were all stillborn. The white flag was secretly rolled up before it was even unfurled. Otherwise, who knows what kind of ominous bird would hatch in the den of night owls.

    “同人刊物”
    吴伯箫
    在资产阶级右派分子群里，办“同人刊物”或者“同人报纸”仿佛是非常时髦的玩艺。那是他们从社会主义行列里旁逸斜出，企图分裂人民的文艺事业、新闻事业的一种阴谋活动。
    其实，刊物而冠以“同人”，嗅觉稍微灵敏一点的人就会立刻闻出它的行会帮派气味的。他们是“同人”，别人当然是“异类”了。若是“同人”以外的人才是多数，才是广大的人民，那么“同人”便是自外于人民、甚或是自绝于人民的。在人民当家做主的新社会里，谁能想像自外于人民或自绝于人民的“同人刊物”会做出对人民有什么利益的好事呢？“我们是一伙”或者“我们是小家族”，喊出的那声音就透露着十足的自私。
    在剥削阶级统治劳动人民的旧社会里，统治阶级的思想常常是统治的思想，真正人民的呼声是没有办法从官办的刊物上发表出来的；若是有少数人结合起来办同人刊物，为了旗帜鲜明，像从浓云里透出一线阳光，在黑夜里燃起一点灯火一样，敢于违反统治的思想，标出独立的主张，说别人所不敢说的话，讲压迫者所不让讲的道理，从而揭开蒙昧者的眼睛，唤醒沉睡着的人们，号召大家战斗，前进，那样的刊物毫无疑问是有进步意义的。那样的“同人”是进步的、革命的。
    但是到了社会主义社会，生产资料的公有制已经代替了私有制，为了创造集体的幸福，打击还可能存在的共同的敌人，人们要求的是统一的意志，统一的行动。百花可以齐放，但百花应当是香花，放给六万万人看；百家可以争鸣，但百家应当为真理而鸣，鸣给六万万人听。若是在这个时候，有一小撮自称“同人”的人，偏要作第一百零一家，扰乱合唱的谐音，唱变调、反调，打乱前进的步伐，倒退或者横行，对人民事业会有什么半点好处呢？把园地圈起来，只许“同人”在那里耕耘种植，孤芳自赏，他们可以有自由，若是秘制的货色还要拿出来推销，刊物还要寻找读者，那么他们又想把主顾引导到哪里去呢？这种“同人刊物”人们是领教过的，“七月”“希望”的幢幢黑影还过去不远。
    1920年前后，苏联有所谓“同路人”作家，那是以“绥拉比翁的兄弟们”那个文学团体为代表的；也许“同人刊物”的筹划者是想学习他们么？可是“同路人”作家最后终于分化了。难道我们的“同人”就以作这种“同路人”为满足么？可是据已经知道的“同人”名单，里边却有不少的人是共产党员啊！
    也许筹办“同人刊物”的人们，会说他们只想在人民的文学里创造一种不同的流派，在写作体裁、文章风格上独具色调，作为百花的一种，百家的一脉；但是，“在社会主义思想的共同基础上，为发展文学的风格和流派而创办的同人刊物”（注），不正是我们党所赞同、所提倡、所欢迎的么？为什么这些“同人”不公开倡导，在万紫千红的艺苑里斗艳竞芳，却要瞒着组织，秘密进行，仿佛有什么不可告人的隐私呢？并且提出口号说：
  “不要任何干涉”呢？奇怪的是，检点一下这些“同人”的队伍，无论是理论家、批评家，或者是小说家、诗人，也无论是内定的编辑，或者是预约的撰稿人，竟然几乎都是右派榜上有名的人物。难道他们不是想完全拒绝党的领导，办成一个个资产阶级式的“自由论坛”么？方以类聚，物以群分，这不是偶然的。
    幸而“同人刊物”“同人报纸”都流产了，白色的旗子还没张开就又偷偷卷起，不然的话，真不知道夜猫子的窝里会孵出什么不祥的鸟来。
    注：见“文艺报”第25期，邵荃麟：“斗争必须更深入”。
