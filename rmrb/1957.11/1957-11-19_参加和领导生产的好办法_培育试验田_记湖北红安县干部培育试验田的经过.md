A Good Way to Participate in and Lead Production - Cultivating Experimental Plots
—A Record of the Process of Cadres Cultivating Experimental Plots in Hong'an County, Hubei
By our correspondent Gu Weijin
Grain Yield Exceeds the 800-Jin Target of the Agricultural Program
In early winter, I arrived in the old revolutionary base area of Hong'an County. Everywhere, people were enthusiastically talking about the bumper harvest. Some old farmers said that they could find similar years in their memories of the past seventy or eighty years, but this year's bumper harvest was beyond their memories. When I arrived at the Hong'an County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, I learned that this year was an unprecedented overall bumper harvest for the entire county. The average grain yield per mu was 834 jin, exceeding the target of the revised draft of the Agricultural Development Program, an increase of approximately 116% compared to 1952, and approximately 18% compared to 1956. The county had 163,000 mu of grain land yielding 1,000 jin (accounting for 44.3% of the grain cultivated area), three grain-yielding 1,000-jin districts (none last year), seventeen grain-yielding 1,000-jin townships (only four last year), and 313 grain-yielding 1,000-jin cooperatives (only twenty-two last year). The average peanut yield per mu was 625 jin, exceeding the planning target proposed by the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party for 1962, an increase of 71.6% compared to 1955, and 31.9% compared to 1956. The county had 11,000 mu of peanut land yielding 1,000 jin (accounting for 23.4% of the peanut cultivated area), fifteen peanut-yielding 1,000-jin townships, and 259 peanut-yielding 1,000-jin cooperatives. Other crops: the average cotton yield per mu was 50 jin, an increase of 56.3% compared to 1956; the average rapeseed yield per mu was 57 jin, an increase of 159% compared to 1956. From the end of last year to mid-September of this year, the number of live pigs increased from 61,800 to 130,000, an increase of 113%. The county averages 1.5 pigs per household (this winter, it can achieve two pigs per household). The number of cattle, sheep, chickens, ducks, etc., has also increased significantly compared to last year. This year, the total value of the county's diversified operations and various sideline businesses increased by 142.6% compared to 1956.
All 732 cooperatives in the county increased production. The total income value of the county's 80,000 cooperative members increased by 39.98% compared to 1956, with an average actual income of 254 yuan per household, an increase of 31.96% compared to 1956. The public accumulation of cooperatives nearly doubled compared to 1956. All forty-eight townships in the county had surplus grain. The grain retained by farmers (including increased grain) increased from 601 jin last year to 640 jin this year. The surplus grain sold to the state increased by 17 million jin compared to last year, and the oil sold to the state increased by 600,000 jin compared to last year.
Solved the Contradiction Between Cadres Participating in Production and Leading Production
At the Hong'an County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, I asked County Party Secretary Cheng Peng about the reasons for this year's bumper harvest. He said that there were many reasons, but from the leadership's perspective, the main reason was the cultivation of experimental plots. He noticed my surprised look and explained, "Cultivating experimental plots means that every working cadre, in conjunction with technical cadres and experienced farmers, cultivates 1.8 mu of land, achieves results, demonstrates to the masses, and guides mass production."
"What exactly is that?" I asked.
Cheng Peng thought for a moment and slowly began to talk about the process of cultivating experimental plots:
At the beginning of this year's spring plowing, under the call of "participating in production and leading production" put forward by the County Party Committee, cadres throughout the county each prepared a tool (hoe, etc.), a labor manual, and participated in the production labor of the cooperatives. However, at that time, a problem arose, namely that most cadres lacked production knowledge—how to grasp the production links, whether the production quality was good, how the production technology was done, how the production plan was implemented, etc., were not clear. As a result, a situation arose in which cadres carried tools every day, listened to the cooperative's allocation of work, and were simply used as a labor force. The entire production leadership fell into a passive position. That is to say, cadres' participation in production did not play a role in leading production.
"At that time, we were really anxious!" Cheng Peng frowned.
"It was in this extremely difficult situation that we explored the path to leading production—cultivating experimental plots."
Cheng Peng smiled slightly and talked about the beginning of cultivating experimental plots: In a house in the Wufanggang (name of a bay) production team of the Jiansu Cooperative in Xinghua Township, the focus of the County Party Committee's work, various peanut varieties donated by various provinces were preserved. Technical cadre Zhu Yihong cultivated a peanut experimental plot to plant these varieties. This aroused Cheng Peng's interest. He invited Zhu Yihong, Guo Litai, the director of the Jiansu Cooperative, and experienced farmers to also cultivate a peanut experimental plot to plant local varieties. They adopted new technical measures—applying base fertilizer, inoculating seeds with rhizobia, and close planting. Applying base fertilizer was not a habit of the masses in the past. They believed that applying base fertilizer would result in "air shells" (i.e., small grains with thick shells). However, they summarized the experience of wealthy middle peasant Chen Biquan, applying base fertilizer can increase production by 25%; and close planting was not a habit of the masses in the past. They believed that doing so was labor-intensive and not as good as sparse planting (planting one or two seeds per hill). Now they are studying with experienced farmers and have found that in the past, sometimes occasional close planting (i.e., planting three seeds per hill) could increase the number of peanuts from the past twenty or thirty per plant to eighty or ninety to two or three hundred... When the peanut sowing season arrived, they used new technical measures to sow. Cadres from this township and cadres from the district guidance groups heard that County Party Secretary Cheng Peng had personally cultivated a peanut experimental plot and came to visit. Cheng Peng and technical cadres, etc., promoted the benefits of implementing new technical measures for increasing production on the one hand, and performed on the spot on the other hand. This aroused the attention of the cadres. When they went back, they all adopted new technical measures such as applying base fertilizer and close planting in their key cooperatives to cultivate peanut experimental plots, promoting technical innovation in the cooperatives.
This matter gave Cheng Peng a great inspiration. He originally lacked production knowledge. Now, after cultivating a peanut experimental plot with technical cadres and experienced farmers, he began to understand when to apply base fertilizer, when to inoculate seeds, and when to plant peanuts during the sowing period; how much base fertilizer should be applied per mu, what percentage of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium fertilizer should be in the base fertilizer, how rhizobia inoculation and close planting are carried out, etc. More importantly, through the demonstration of the experimental plot, he promoted the masses to overcome conservative ideas and adopt new technical measures. Cheng Peng began to realize that cadres personally cultivating experimental plots was a good way to solve the problem of leading production.
Became the Driving Force for Promoting Production
In April, after the County Party Committee studied the experience of Cheng Peng and others in cultivating peanut experimental plots, it called on cadres in various places to learn from them. In May, a upsurge of cultivating experimental plots was launched throughout the county. Fourteen of the eighteen members of the County Party Committee cultivated experimental plots, 195 of the 276 district cadres cultivated experimental plots, and 324 of the 490 township cadres cultivated experimental plots. There were many types of experimental plots: 496 mu of peanut experimental land, 643 mu of rice experimental land, 125 mu of cotton experimental land, and sweet potato experimental land, etc.
Experimental plots have played a great role in promoting production.
Close planting of rice has been a long-term problem that is not easy to solve in many places throughout the county. However, after the demonstration of experimental plots, the problem of close planting was solved. For example, in the Jiangpai Cooperative of Xinzhai Township, the masses did not understand the promotion of close planting of rice last year. Although the cadres took rulers to the fields to measure and corrected all the sizes that did not meet the close planting standards, the masses still planted sparsely after the cadres left. As a result, 80% of the cooperative's rice was sparsely planted. This year, cadres promoted close planting of rice, starting with their own experimental plots. They first summarized the experience that some close planting of rice last year increased production by 72% compared to sparse planting. When the rice transplanting season arrived, they held mass meetings in the fields to introduce these experiences and mobilize the masses to discuss them, while carrying out close planting demonstrations. The masses realized the benefits of close planting and all agreed to close planting. 95% of the cooperative's rice was promoted to close planting.
Technical measures such as deep plowing of rice, pest control, peanut soil cultivation, foliar application of phosphorus fertilizer, and cotton pruning have all been widely promoted through the demonstration of experimental plots.
Through the demonstration of experimental plots, many backward fields have also been eliminated. Cadres in Tainan Township summarized the experience of veteran farmer Jin Gongtang in eliminating 1.5 mu of backward peanut land and obtaining a yield of 800 jin per mu (i.e., plowing, applying sufficient base fertilizer, etc.), and experimented in backward land, achieving very good results. As a result, they promoted the elimination of 22 mu of backward peanut land in the cooperative, and then promoted the elimination of 505 mu of backward peanut land in the township. The average peanut yield increased from 400 jin per mu to 640 jin. According to statistics from the County Party Committee Office, approximately 10,000 mu of backward peanut land, 41,000 mu of backward rice land, and 84,000 mu of backward summer harvest crops land were eliminated throughout the county through the demonstration of experimental plots.
Under the promotion of the cultivation of experimental plots by the vast number of cadres, a upsurge of cultivating high-yield fields has emerged throughout the county. No matter where, wherever there are cadres cultivating experimental plots, the masses cultivate high-yield fields to compete with the cadres. Eight cooperatives in Taiping Township saw that the working cadres were cultivating 1,000-jin rice experimental plots, and the cooperative committees of the eight cooperatives organized a "High-Yield Paddies Joint Committee" to lead the masses in cultivating 10,000 mu of 1,000-jin high-yield rice paddies. The Jiansu Cooperative in Xinghua Township saw that the working cadres were cultivating 1,000-jin peanut experimental land, and they cultivated four 1,000-jin high-yield peanut ridges and two 1,000-jin high-yield peanut paddies (totaling more than 300 mu). Four cooperatives in Zhonghe Township and Bali Township saw that the working cadres were cultivating 100-jin ginned cotton experimental plots, and they jointly cultivated 100-jin ginned cotton high-yield isles (totaling 350 mu). These cooperatives have all achieved their increased production targets (some cooperatives have even exceeded them) due to actively adopting new technical measures.
People Have Developed Deep Feelings for the Countryside
After listening to Old Jiang's conversation, I noticed a problem: After the cadres cultivated experimental plots, how many people learned agricultural production knowledge? Old Jiang opened his notebook and said: There are 766 county, district, and township cadres who live in the countryside for a long time, of which 476 learned five kinds of farm work (i.e., 1. Plowing and building dams; 2. Preventing and controlling diseases and pests; 3. Selecting and mixing seeds; 4. Mastering the production season; 5. Weeding and transplanting), accounting for 62.1%, and 214 learned four kinds of farm work (i.e., excluding plowing), accounting for 28%. These two types of people account for 90% of the 766 people. More than 100 county and district cadres who were sent to work in the countryside for a short period of time also learned two or three kinds of farm work, and a few people learned five kinds of farm work. Cadres who have learned four to five kinds of farm work can basically lead the production of a township or cooperative.
Old Jiang said with great interest that because the vast majority of cadres have learned agricultural production knowledge and can lead the production of a township or cooperative, people's attitude towards the countryside has changed - from lack of interest to deep feelings.
Seeing that I was listening with relish, Old Jiang continued: From the County Party Committee's situation of going to the countryside, we can also see people's feelings for the countryside. In the past, only three of the eighteen members of the County Party Committee lived in the countryside regularly. Some of the others had never been to the countryside, and even if they did, they stayed for a very short time (at most eighty or ninety days). Now, sixteen people live in the countryside regularly. According to ten months of statistics, the minimum time spent in the countryside is ninety to one hundred and twenty days, the average is one hundred and forty to one hundred and sixty days, and the maximum is one hundred and eighty to two hundred and twenty days. The County Party Committee's return to hold meetings is also different from the past: in the past, everyone was full of energy at the beginning of the meeting. When the meeting was over and they were about to go to the countryside, some people were in a bad mood and made excuses to delay going to the countryside; now, after the meeting, people hurry to go down, and no one wants to stay in the office. Even during the meeting, people seize the gaps to call the townships to ask how the experimental plots are doing and how the production of the cooperative is doing. They said, "People are in the county, but their hearts are in the township. If you don't ask, it's hard to put your heart down." The general cadres also have deep feelings for the countryside like the County Party Committee. Now the cadres living in the countryside have this requirement: send them wherever they are, fix them wherever they are, and do not change them, so that they can start a family and establish a career. Many people have also submitted a contract to the higher authorities - contracting the production of the township or cooperative where they live for the whole year, and everything is their responsibility. The reason why they made these requests is, as some people said: "In the past, we always said that we were building socialism in the countryside, but we didn't know where to start. Now we know: living in the countryside for a long time and truly leading the production of a township or cooperative is to build socialism in the countryside." (Attached pictures)

    参加和领导生产的好办法——培育试验田
    ——记湖北红安县干部培育试验田的经过
    本报记者　古维进
  粮食产量超过农业纲要八百斤的指标
    初冬，我来到老苏区红安县。这里那里，都听到人们兴致勃勃地谈论丰收。一些老农民说前几年的丰收，自己还能从七八十年的记忆里找到类似的年景，可是今年的丰收，却是记忆里找不到的。当我到了中共红安县委会，才知道今年是全县空前的全面大丰收。粮食平均亩产八百三十四斤，超过农业发展纲要修正草案的指标，比1952年增加约116％，比1956年增加约18％。全县出现了十六万三千亩粮食千斤田（占粮食耕地面积44．3％），三个粮食千斤区（去年没有），十七个粮食千斤乡（去年只有四个），三百一十三个粮食千斤社（去年只有二十二个）。花生平均亩产六百二十五斤，超过中共湖北省委提出的1962年的计划指标，比1955年增产71．6％，比1956年增产31．9％。全县出现了一万一千亩花生千斤地（占花生耕地面积23．4％），十五个花生千斤乡，二百五十九个花生千斤社。其他作物：棉花平均亩产五十斤，比1956年增产56．3％；油菜平均亩产五十七斤，比1956年增产159％。生猪由去年底到今年9月中旬从六万一千八百头发展到十三万头，增加了113％，全县平均每户养猪一头半（今冬可以实现每户养猪二头），牛羊鸡鸭等也比去年增加很多。今年全县的多种经营和各项副业的收入总值比1956年增加142．6％。
    全县七百三十二个社，社社增产。全县八万户社员的收入总值比1956年增加39．98％，每户平均实际收入二百五十四元，比1956年增加31．96％。合作社的公共积累比1956年增加将近一倍。全县四十八个乡，乡乡有余粮。农民留用粮（包括增产粮）由去年六百零一斤增至今年六百四十斤。售给国家的余粮比去年增加一千七百万斤，售给国家的油脂比去年增加六十万斤。
    解决了干部参加生产领导生产的矛盾
    在中共红安县委会里，我问县委书记程鹏今年取得丰收的原因。他说原因很多，从领导方面来说，主要的是培育了试验田。他瞅我有点诧异的样子，解释说：“培育试验田就是每一个工作干部结合技术干部、老农等，种上一亩八分土地，搞出成绩，向群众示范，指导群众生产。
    “那是怎么一回事呢？”我问。
    程鹏想了一想，慢斯条理地说起培育试验田的经过：
    今年春耕开始，全县干部在县委提出“参加生产领导生产”的号召下，每个人自备一把工具（锄头等），一本劳动手册，参加了合作社的生产劳动。但是当时出现一个问题，即大部分干部缺乏生产知识——生产环节怎样抓，生产质量好不好，生产技术搞得怎么样，生产计划贯彻执行得如何等，都搞不清楚。于是出现这样一种局面：干部每天带着工具，听凭社里分派活路，单纯地被当作一个劳动力使用，整个生产领导陷于被动，就是说，干部参加生产没有发挥领导生产的作用。
    “这时候，我们真焦急呵！”程鹏皱眉说。
    “就在这种万难的情况下，我们摸索到领导生产的门路——培育试验田。”
    程鹏微微一笑，谈到培育试验田的开始：在县委工作重点杏花乡建苏社五房港（湾子的名字）生产队的一间房子里，保存了各省赠送的花生品种。技术干部祝翼鸿搞了一块花生试验地种植这些品种。这引起了程鹏的兴趣。他邀了祝翼鸿、建苏社主任郭李太和老农等也搞了一块花生试验地，种植本地品种。他们采取了新的技术措施——施底肥，根瘤菌拌种、密植。施底肥，群众过去没有这个习惯，认为施底肥会结“气壳子”（即子粒小，壳皮厚），但是，他们总结富裕中农陈必权的经验，施底肥可以增产25％；又如密植，群众过去也没有这个习惯，认为这样做费工，不如稀植（一蔸下一、二粒种子），现在他们和老农研究，发现过去有时偶然密植（即一蔸下三粒种子），结的花生要由过去的二三十颗增至八九十颗至二三百颗。……当花生播种季节到来，他们采取新的技术措施播种了。本乡的干部和各区指导组的干部听说县委书记程鹏亲自培育了花生试验地，都来参观。程鹏和技术干部等一面宣传实行新的技术措施对增产的好处，一面当场表演。这引起了干部的重视。他们回去，都在自己的重点社采取施底肥、密植等新的技术措施培育花生试验地，推动了社里进行技术革新。
    这件事情给了程鹏很大的启发。他原来是缺乏生产知识的，现在和技术干部、老农等培育花生试验地之后，开始懂得花生在播种期间，何时该上底肥，何时该拌种，何时该种植；一亩地该上多少底肥，底肥里面的氮、磷、钾肥各占多少，根瘤菌拌种和密植是怎样进行的，等等，更重要的，是通过试验地的示范，推动群众克服保守思想，采取新的技术措施。程鹏开始认识到干部亲自培育试验田，是解决领导生产问题的好办法。
    成了推进生产的动力
    4月间，县委研究程鹏等培育花生试验地的经验以后，号召各地干部学习。5月间，全县掀起了培育试验田的热潮。全县十八个县委委员有十四个委员培育了试验田，二百七十六名区干部中，有一百九十五人培育了试验田，四百九十名乡干部中，有三百二十四人培育了试验田。试验田的种类很多：有花生试验地四百九十六亩，水稻试验田六百四十三亩，棉花试验田一百二十五亩，此外，还有红苕试验田等。
    试验田对于推动生产起了很大作用。
    水稻密植，曾经是全县许多地方长期不容易解决的问题，可是，经过试验田的示范，密植的问题解决了。例如在新寨乡姜牌社，去年推广水稻密植，群众思想不通；尽管干部带着尺子到田间去量，把不合密植尺寸的一律加以纠正，但干部走后，群众还是稀植。结果，全社的水稻有80％是稀植。今年干部推广水稻密植，首先从自己的试验田做起。他们事先总结去年有些水稻密植比稀植增产72％的经验，到了栽秧季节，就在田头举行群众会议介绍这些经验，发动群众讨论，同时进行密植表演。群众认识到了密植的好处，都同意密植。全社的水稻有95％推广了密植。
    水稻的深耕、除虫、花生的培土壅蔸、根外施磷肥、棉花的整枝打杈等技术措施，都通过试验田的示范得到普遍推广。
    通过试验田的示范，还消灭了许多落后田。台南乡干部总结老农金共堂过去消灭一亩五分花生落后地获得亩产八百斤的经验（即翻耕、施足底肥等），在落后地试验，取得很好的成绩，于是推动全社消灭花生落后地二十二亩，接着推动全乡消灭花生落后地五百零五亩。花生由平均亩产四百斤增至六百四十斤。据县委办公室统计，全县通过试验田的示范，消灭花生落后地约一万亩、水稻落后田四万一千亩、夏收作物落后田八万四千亩。
    在广大干部培育试验田的推动下，全县出现了培育丰产田的热潮。不管在什么地方，凡有干部培育试验田的，群众都培育丰产田和干部比赛。太平乡有八个社看见工作干部培育水稻千斤试验田，八个社的社委就组织了“培育丰产畈联合委员会”，领导群众培育了万亩千斤水稻丰产畈。杏花乡建苏社看见工作干部培育花生千斤试验地，他们培育了四个花生千斤丰产岗、两个花生千斤丰产畈（共计三百多亩）。中和乡和八里乡有四个社看见工作干部培育百斤皮棉试验田，他们联合起来培育了百斤皮棉丰产洲（共计三百五十亩）。这些合作社由于积极采取新的技术措施，增产指标全部实现了（有的社还超过）。
    人们对农村发生了深厚的感情
    听了老姜上面的谈话，引起我注意一个问题：干部培育试验田之后，有多少人学会了农业生产知识？老姜翻开笔记本说道：全县长期住在农村的县、区、乡干部有七百六十六人，其中学会五种农活的（即：一、犁田打坝；二、防治病虫害；三、选种拌种；四、掌握生产季节；五、薅草、插秧）四百七十六人，占62．1％，学会四种农活的（即不算犁田）二百一十四人，占28％。这两种人占七百六十六人的90％。短期派到农村工作的县区干部一百多人，也学会了二三种农活，少数人学会五种农活。凡是学会四种至五种农活的干部，基本上可以把一乡一社的生产领导起来。
    老姜兴致勃勃的说，由于绝大部分干部学到农业生产知识，能够领导一乡一社的生产，人们对农村的态度变了——由缺乏兴趣变为具有深厚的感情。
    看见我听得津津有味，老姜接着说：从县委的下乡情形，也可以看出人们对于农村的感情。过去十八个县委委员，经常住在农村的只有三个人，其余的人有的没有下过乡，有的即使下去，住的时间很短（最多八九十天）。现在经常住在农村的有十六个人，据十个月统计，住农村的时间最少的是九十天至一百二十天，一般的是一百四十天至一百六十天，最多的是一百八十天至二百二十天。县委回来开会也和过去不一样：过去，会议开始，大家劲头很足，一到会议结束要下乡，有些人就情绪不好，借故拖延下乡；现在开完会议，人们都赶快下去，没有一个人愿意留在机关。甚至在开会期间，人们还抓住空隙打电话到乡里询问试验田搞得怎样，社的生产搞得怎样。他们说：“人在县里，心在乡里，不问一问，心里难得放下来。”一般的干部也和县委一样对农村具有深厚的感情。现在住在农村的干部都有这种要求：派到哪里，固定到哪里，不要变动，以便兴家立业，有许多人还向上级提出订立包干合同——把自己所住的乡或社的生产全年包干下来，一切由他负责。他们所以提出这些要求，正如有些人说的：“过去总是说在农村建设社会主义，却不知从那里着手，现在晓得了：长期住在农村，切切实实的把一乡一社的生产领导起来，就是在农村建设社会主义。”（附图片）
