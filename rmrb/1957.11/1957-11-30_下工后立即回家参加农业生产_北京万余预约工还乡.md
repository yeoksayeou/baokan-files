Returning Home Immediately After Work to Participate in Agricultural Production
Over Ten Thousand Beijing Contract Workers Return to Their Villages

(Reported by this newspaper) Recently, more than 12,300 contract workers from Beijing's construction and municipal enterprises have returned to their villages after finishing their work to participate in winter agricultural production.

Recently, Beijing changed the contract relationship of contract workers in the construction industry from individual contracts between employers and individuals to contracts between employers and agricultural production cooperatives. After discussions, the broad masses of contract workers corrected the ideas of some people who belittled agriculture and unanimously agreed that this new method is beneficial to individuals, agricultural cooperatives, and the country. Many contract workers stated one after another that after finishing their work, they would immediately return to their villages to participate in agricultural production; if the country needs them, they will come again next year. Many contract workers who had brought their families to the city also decided to return to their villages with their families. More than 400 contract workers of the Beijing Third Construction Engineering Company whose contracts were not due to expire until the end of December this year have now returned to their villages early after completing their tasks ahead of schedule.

At the farewell meetings held in units such as the Beijing Fifth Construction Engineering Company, the returning contract workers all guaranteed that they would actively participate in agricultural production after returning home. Before leaving, the first group of contract workers from the Capital Iron and Steel Company construction team who returned to their villages posted big-character posters, guaranteeing that they would work hard to participate in agricultural production.

    下工后立即回家参加农业生产
    北京万余预约工还乡
    本报讯　北京市建筑、市政企业最近有一万二千三百多名预约工人下工还乡，参加冬季农业生产。
    北京市最近把建筑业预约工人的预约关系由用人单位同个人订合同，改成由用人单位同农业生产合作社订合同。广大预约工人经过讨论，纠正了部分人的轻视农业等思想，一致认为这项新办法对个人、对农业社和国家都有好处。许多预约工人纷纷表示，下工以后，要立即还乡参加农业生产；国家如果需要，明年再来。许多把家属接到城里来的预约工人，还决定携眷还乡。北京市第三建筑工程公司有四百多名预约工人到今年12月底预约合同才满期，现在他们在提前完成任务以后已经提前下工回乡。
    在北京市第五建筑工程公司等单位举行的欢送会上，回乡预约工都保证回去积极参加农业生产。京西矿务局土建队第一批下工还乡的预约工，临行前还贴出大字报，保证努力参加农业生产。
