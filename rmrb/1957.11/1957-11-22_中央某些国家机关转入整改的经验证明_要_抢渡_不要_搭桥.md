    Experiences of Certain Central State Organs in Switching to Rectification Prove That It is Necessary to "Wade Across" Rather Than "Build a Bridge"
    (Our reporter Zheng Qimin reports) In early October, when a few units in the central state organs transitioned from the anti-Rightist struggle to the third stage of rectification, two different views and practices emerged regarding how to make this transition. One view advocated for a transition period between the anti-Rightist campaign and the third stage of rectification. This transition period would primarily involve debating and criticizing various erroneous ideas existing among some of the masses that were unfavorable to carrying out the rectification, in order to distinguish between major rights and wrongs, raise the masses' ideological understanding, dispel concerns, and lay an ideological foundation for entering the third stage of rectification. In their vernacular, this was called "building a bridge for transitioning to the third stage of rectification." The other view advocated directly entering the third stage of rectification after achieving victory in the anti-Rightist struggle. They called on the masses to speak out freely and oppose having a "transition period" in between, firmly advocating for "wading across."
    The nature of the third stage of rectification is fundamentally different from that of the second stage. The main task of the second stage was to oppose the Rightists. It was the Rightists who set the fire, and we countered. It was about resolving the contradiction between the enemy and ourselves. The main task of the third stage of rectification is to overcome the "three isms" (subjectivism, sectarianism, bureaucratism). It is about mobilizing the masses to speak out freely, igniting the fire to burn our own shortcomings and errors, and resolving contradictions among the people. Therefore, guiding this massive mass movement to make a 180-degree turn in a short period of time is indeed a complex new problem. Thus, at the time, both views seemed to have their own merits. In order to find some experience in leading the movement in practice, the Party Committee of the Central State Organs stated that these two methods could be adopted separately according to the situation of each organ, without forcing uniformity, in order to conduct examination and comparison in actual experiments, and summarize a better method for promotion.
    More than a month of experimentation has proven that in general organs, after achieving a decisive victory in the anti-Rightist struggle, directly transitioning to the third stage of rectification with its emphasis on extensive airing of views, thorough rectification, and major improvements, without undergoing a period of ideological criticism, is an effective method welcomed by the broad masses. The method of "building a bridge for transitioning to the third stage of rectification" is not clear enough and is an undesirable experience, even a lesson. The Seventh Bureau of the Second Ministry of Machine Building was the first unit to use the "wading across" method to transition to extensive airing of views. After the victorious conclusion of the anti-Rightist struggle at the end of September, the leadership of the bureau held three rectification leading group meetings in a row, specifically discussing how to make the transition. After repeated discussions, they believed that the main task of the third stage of rectification was to "ignite the fire on ourselves," and this "ourselves" did not refer to anything else but the leadership of the bureau. What needed to be burned away was precisely the "three isms" of the leadership. Therefore, after three or four days of preparation, the bureau called on the masses to speak out freely on October 6th, and from the very beginning guided the masses to direct their fire at the leadership's "three isms." As a result, forty-six big-character posters were put up the next day. After three weeks of extensive airing of views, a total of six hundred and forty big-character posters were put up, raising a total of eight hundred and thirty-one opinions. The main problems in the bureau were exposed within three weeks. The General Office of the Ministry of Urban Construction adopted the "bridge-building" method to transition to the third stage of rectification. The anti-Rightist struggle in the office ended victoriously in early September. From mid-September to mid-October, they held twenty-four plenary staff meetings, one after another, analyzing and criticizing the general erroneous ideas among the masses and some of the main reactionary arguments of the Rightists. Out of one hundred and seventy staff members, one hundred and four spoke at the meetings. In early October, the leadership made two mobilization reports to all staff members, calling for extensive airing of views. At the same time, they organized staff members to visit the Beijing Printing Factory No. 1 to observe the airing of views by the workers. However, the masses' enthusiasm for airing their views remained low. Big-character posters were posted sparsely, three or five a day, and they mostly exposed small problems and trivial matters, criticizing general shortcomings and the style of general cadres, with few exposing big problems or criticizing the "three isms" of leading cadres. Some comrades wrote their criticisms of the leadership as suggestions, using very euphemistic language. Some comrades clearly had opinions but did not express them, wanting to "wait and see." Later, the number of big-character posters gradually increased, but the focus was on the work style of general cadres and discussing minor issues such as whether or not the small east gate in the office should be blocked. It was not until recently, after the leadership made great efforts, that a real high tide of airing of views gradually formed. The Education Department of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry also once adopted this method, and the effect was similarly poor.
    Why is the method of directly transitioning better than the method of transitioning after ideological criticism? This is mainly because a strong contingent of activists has been formed in the anti-Rightist struggle, and the vast majority of the masses have raised their class consciousness and basically recognized the major rights and wrongs. After the victory of the anti-Rightist struggle, these activists and the majority of the masses eagerly hope that the leadership can quickly overcome the shortcomings and errors in their work. Under this situation, the leaders must firmly believe in the majority of the masses and give full play to the masses' enthusiasm in helping the leadership with rectification. The reason why the Seventh Bureau of the Second Ministry of Machine Building was able to air views quickly, well, and expose many problems, and why the enthusiasm of the masses has always been relatively high, is that it was able to firmly grasp this characteristic, and promptly guide this army in the anti-Rightist struggle to the front line of the rectification campaign which emphasized extensive airing of views, thorough rectification, and major improvements. The bureau was able to capitalize on the momentum, quickly setting off a high tide of airing of views, and creating good conditions for the smooth implementation of thorough rectification and major improvements. The reason why the airing of views movement in the General Office of the Ministry of Urban Construction could not be carried out smoothly is that they did not believe in the majority of the masses very much, did not fully anticipate the eagerness of the majority of the masses to see the leadership carry out thorough rectification and major improvements, and did not ignite the flames of rectification desired by the majority of the masses in a timely manner. Instead, they guided the masses to spend too much time and energy criticizing general erroneous ideas, thus reducing their enthusiasm for directing their fire at the "three isms," and even causing some of the masses to have unnecessary doubts about thorough rectification and major improvements, prolonging the time of rectification.
    "Wading across" is better than "building a bridge" also because, in "wading across," Party and Youth League members and activists use practical actions to motivate those who have ideological concerns to air their views. The practical actions of the majority are used to gradually dispel the ideological concerns of the minority. Experience has proven that this is a major method, and the most effective method, for dispelling the ideological concerns of a small number of the masses. Of course, for those who have relatively serious erroneous statements, it is also necessary to "cut off their pigtails" in order to dispel their concerns about continuing to speak out freely. However, this only requires the leadership to resolve it through individual talks. The "bridge-building" method, on the other hand, does the opposite. Not only does it fail to promptly use the practical actions of Party and Youth League members and activists to dispel the ideological concerns of some of the masses, but it also treats the erroneous statements of a small number of people from the previous period as an obstacle to carrying out rectification work, conducting large-scale ideological criticism. The result of doing so is not only that it fails to promptly resolve the ideological concerns of the masses, but it also increases the ideological concerns of the masses, making them even more afraid to speak out boldly. Therefore, to a certain extent, it affects the smooth development of the rectification movement.

### 中央某些国家机关转入整改的经验证明  要“抢渡”不要“搭桥”

    中央某些国家机关转入整改的经验证明
    要“抢渡”不要“搭桥”
    本报讯　记者郑启民报道：10月上旬，当中央国家机关中少数单位由反右派斗争转入整风第三阶段的时候，在如何转的问题上，出现了两种不同的主张和做法。一种主张是由反右派转入整风第三阶段，中间要有一个过渡期，在这个过渡期中主要是辩论和批判部分群众中存在着的不利于开展整风的各种错误思想，以便明辨大是大非，提高群众思想认识，解除顾虑，为转入整风第三阶段打下思想基础。按照他们的通俗说法这叫“为转入整风第三阶段搭桥”。另一种主张是在反右派斗争取得胜利的基础上直接转入整风第三阶段，一开始就号召群众大鸣大放，反对在两者中间有个“过渡期”，坚决主张实行“抢渡”。
    整风第三阶段与第二阶段的性质是根本不同的。第二阶段的主要任务是反右派，是右派放火，我们反击，是解决敌我之间的矛盾；整风第三阶段的主要任务是克服“三个主义”，是发动群众大鸣大放，引火烧自己的缺点和错误，是解决人民内部的矛盾。因此，要在短时间内，引导这个声势浩大的群众运动来一个一百八十度的大转弯，确实是一个复杂的新问题。因此，在当时看来这两种主张也确实各有道理。为了能在实践中找到一些领导运动的经验，中共中央国家机关党委会曾表示：这两种方法可以根据各机关的情况分别采用，不必强求一律，以便在实际试验中进行考查和比较，总结出一个比较好的方法，加以推广。
    经过一个多月来的试验证明，在一般机关中，在反右派斗争取得决定性的胜利之后，不经过思想批判的过渡时期，直接转入大鸣大放大整大改的整风第三阶段，是行之有效而又为广大群众所欢迎的好办法；而“为整风转入第三阶段搭桥”的方法是不够明确的，是不可取的一个经验，也是一个教训。第二机械工业部第七局是最先运用“抢渡”方法转入大鸣大放的单位。该局在9月底反右派斗争胜利结束以后，领导上曾经一连召开过三次整风领导小组会议，专门讨论了如何转的问题，经过反复讨论，认为整风第三阶段的主要任务是“引火烧身”，而这个“身”不是指的别的，就是指局的领导，要烧掉的也正是领导上的“三个主义”。因此，该局经过三、四天的准备工作之后，于10月6日号召群众大鸣大放，一开始就引导群众向领导上的“三个主义”开火。结果第二天就贴出了四十六张大字报，经过三个星期的大鸣大放，先后贴出了六百四十多张大字报，一共提出了八百三十一条意见，局里的主要问题在三个星期之内都被揭露了出来。城市建设部办公厅是采用“搭桥”的办法转入整风第三阶段的。该厅9月上旬反右派斗争胜利结束，他们从9月中旬到10月中旬，先后召开了二十四次全体工作人员大会，对于群众中的一般错误思想和右派分子的一些主要的反动论点，都一个一个进行了分析和批判。一百七十个工作人员中有一百零四人在大会上发了言。10月初领导上向全体工作人员做了两次动员报告，号召大鸣大放，同时又组织工作人员参观了北京印刷一厂工人们的鸣放情况。但是，群众的鸣放情绪仍然不高。大字报稀稀拉拉地每天三张、五张地贴出来，而且揭发小问题小事情的多，批评一般缺点和一般干部作风的多，揭发大问题少，批评领导干部“三个主义”的少。有的同志把对领导上的批评写成建议，用词非常婉转。有的同志明明有意见也不提，要“等一等再说”。后来大字报渐渐多一些了，但是火力却集中在一般干部的作风和讨论机关里的小东门该不该堵塞等小问题上。直到最近领导上又经过很大的努力，真正的鸣放高潮才逐渐形成。冶金工业部的教育司也曾经一度采用过这种办法，效果同样不好。
    为什么采取直接转的方法比经过思想批判以后再转的方法好呢？这主要是由于在反右派斗争中已经形成一支强大的积极分子队伍，而且绝大多数群众都提高了阶级觉悟，基本上认清了大是大非。这些积极分子和多数群众在反右派斗争取得胜利后，热切地希望领导上能尽快地克服工作中的缺点和错误。在这种形势下，领导者必须坚决相信群众的多数，充分发挥群众帮助领导上整改的积极性。第二机械工业部第七局所以能够鸣放的快，鸣放的好，揭发的问题多，群众的热情一直比较高的原因，就在于能够紧紧地抓住这个特点，及时地把这支反右派斗争中的大军引导到大鸣大放大整大改的整风前线，发挥多数群众的整风积极性，趁热打铁，迅速地掀起鸣放的高潮，为顺利地进行大整大改创造了良好的条件。城市建设部办公厅的鸣放运动之所以不能顺利开展，就是由于他们不大相信群众的多数，没有充分预料到多数群众那种急切地渴望着领导上进行大整大改的心情，没有把多数群众要求整改的火苗及时地点燃起来。而是引导群众用过多的时间和精力去批判一般的错误思想，因而减低了他们向“三个主义”开火的积极性，甚至引起部分群众对大整大改产生了不必要的怀疑，延长了整风的时间。
    “抢渡”所以比“搭桥”好，还由于在“抢渡”的时候，是由党、团员和积极分子用实际行动去带动那些有思想顾虑的人进行鸣放，是用多数人的实际行动去逐渐解除少数人的思想顾虑。经验证明这是解除少数群众思想顾虑的一种主要方法，也是最有效的方法。当然对于那些有比较严重的错误言论的人，也需要作割“小辫子”的工作，才能解除他们对继续大鸣大放的顾虑。但这只需要领导上以个别谈话的方式去解决就可以了。而“搭桥”的办法却恰恰相反，不但没有及时地运用党团员和积极分子的实际行动去解除部分群众的思想顾虑，而且把一小部分人的前一个时期的错误言论，当成进行整改工作的障碍，进行规模较大的思想批判。这样做的结果，不但没有及时地解决了群众的思想顾虑，反而更增加了群众的思想顾虑，弄得他们更不敢大胆鸣放了，因此，在一定程度上它影响了整风运动的顺利开展。
