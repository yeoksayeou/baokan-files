A Review and Outlook on the First Five-Year Plan

    Combining the Use of Motor Vehicles and Civilian Vehicles
    Zhu Tianshun, Deputy Director of the General Bureau of Highways, Ministry of Communications
    During the period of the First Five-Year Plan, the highway transportation sector basically met the needs of the national economy. Thanks to the continuous improvement of the management level of state-owned motor vehicle transportation and the implementation of joint state-private ownership of private transportation and its repair industry, relevant departments organized some motor vehicles from government agencies and enterprises to participate in public transportation. It is estimated that by the end of 1957, the freight volume of motor vehicle transportation will exceed the 1957 target set by the First Five-Year Plan by 50%, an increase of 383% compared to 1952; the passenger volume of motor vehicle transportation will exceed the 1957 target by 108%, an increase of 440% compared to 1952; the transportation efficiency of passenger and freight vehicles will increase by 139% compared to 1952, and the transportation cost will decrease by 36.25%. While consolidating and expanding the motor vehicle transportation industry, relevant departments also implemented a policy of appropriate development and full utilization of the vast number of civilian vehicles. During the five years, approximately 80% of the highway freight volume and 40% of the turnover volume were completed by civilian vehicles.
    The experiences and lessons learned by the highway transportation sector during the First Five-Year Plan are very rich, and the most important one is that motor vehicles and civilian vehicles must be used in combination.
    Why is it necessary to do this? Mainly because:
    (1) The growth rate of highway passenger and freight volume is very fast. During the period of the First Five-Year Plan, the freight turnover volume of motor vehicles increased by an average of 42.6% per year, and the passenger turnover volume increased by an average of 36.2% per year. Since China's automobile industry and petroleum industry are not yet well-developed, it is difficult to meet the needs solely by increasing the number of motor vehicles. However, China's existing five million animal-drawn vehicles and ten million human-powered vehicles are a huge transportation force that should be fully utilized. This can not only make up for the shortage of motor vehicle transportation capacity, but also increase the sideline income of agricultural production cooperatives.
      (2) The transport volume is unbalanced between years and seasons. At present, in the composition of highway freight volume, mineral building materials and timber account for about 45%, and agricultural and sideline products account for 31%; the remaining industrial product transport volume is also closely related to the development of agriculture. The size of national construction and the success of agricultural harvests play a decisive role in highway transport volume. However, the scale of national construction and agricultural harvests cannot be balanced every year due to various objective factors. In addition, basic construction, agricultural production, and commercial markets also have great seasonality. In this case of unbalanced annual and seasonal transport volume, to adapt to objective needs, there must be a certain reserve transport capacity. However, given China's current industrial level and financial situation, it is difficult to maintain a considerable number of motor vehicles as a reserve transportation force; civilian vehicles are the most reliable reserve transport capacity. They play a great regulatory role in years of transportation tension and peak transportation seasons (the peak transportation season is usually the slack season for rural vehicles).
    (3) Before liberation, China's highway mileage was only 75,000 kilometers, and now the highway mileage has reached more than 227,000 kilometers. After liberation, the average annual increase in highway mileage is more than 20,000 kilometers. However, due to China's vast territory, the current number of highways is far from meeting the needs of the national economy. Due to financial constraints, we cannot build highways in all places where they are needed in the short term, and even if they are built, there are not enough motor vehicles. The exchange of goods in those places where highways cannot be built for the time being can only be borne by local civilian vehicles, or even pack animals.
    (4) Highway transportation is basically a sectional short-distance transportation. At present, except for highway transportation in the Northwest, Southwest, and other border areas, which is still undertaking long-distance trunk transportation tasks, the average transportation distance of highway transportation in the inland provinces is generally only about nine kilometers. Civilian vehicles should be able to handle this short-distance transportation task. When specifically assigning their transportation tasks, it is also possible to select some goods with shorter transportation distances. For example, the average transportation distance of the transportation tasks currently assigned to civilian vehicles is only about six kilometers. Moreover, such short-distance freight tasks are more cost-effective to transport using civilian vehicles than using motor vehicles under the current conditions where manual loading and unloading are mainly used.
      (5) Although most civilian vehicles belong to agricultural production cooperatives, there are also an estimated 500,000 professional animal-drawn vehicles and human-powered vehicles. It is estimated that the population that relies solely on this occupation for a living is about two million. The production and life of this group of people should be planned in a unified manner.
    In short, the experience of implementing the First Five-Year Plan shows that only when the employees of the highway transportation department understand that considering problems cannot be divorced from the overall situation and general policies of the country, and thus pay attention to the appropriate development and full utilization of civilian vehicles, and combine the use of motor vehicles and civilian vehicles, can transportation tasks be better completed; any ideas and practices that despise, squeeze out, or even attempt to eliminate civilian vehicles are wrong.
    During the period of the Second Five-Year Plan, the above situation will not undergo fundamental changes. In the future, in order to better combine the use of motor vehicles and civilian vehicles, the following tasks should be done well:
    (1) Properly arrange the division of labor and cooperation between motor vehicles and civilian vehicles. Under the current circumstances where the number of motor vehicles in our country is very small, motor vehicles should be more concentrated to undertake those transportation tasks that civilian vehicles cannot undertake. In addition to the passenger and freight transport tasks in areas that cannot be accessed by roads for the time being being entirely undertaken by civilian vehicles, short-distance transport tasks within the scope of counties or special districts and transport tasks on highway branch lines should also be organized by civilian vehicles, in order to free up motor vehicles to engage in highway trunk transport. Short-distance transport tasks in urban and suburban areas and parallel to highways, as well as short-distance transport tasks on construction sites, should also be organized by civilian vehicles, in order to give full play to their advantages of being mobile and flexible, convenient for loading and unloading, and delivering goods door-to-door in narrow streets and alleys. Freight transport tasks on some highway trunk lines with busy passenger transport tasks and insufficient motor vehicles should also be organized by civilian vehicles as much as possible, in order to free up motor vehicles to engage in passenger transport tasks. Some construction sites or material supply departments should also use the "vehicle exchange" method as much as possible, even if they have their own motor vehicles, to organize civilian vehicles on their behalf, replacing their motor vehicles to engage in longer-distance highway transport tasks. This can not only give full play to the efficiency of motor vehicles, but also be economically cost-effective for construction sites and material supply departments. In addition, in order to facilitate cargo owners and simplify transportation procedures, joint transportation between motor vehicles and civilian vehicles should be vigorously organized to allow civilian vehicles to concentrate and distribute goods for motor vehicles.
    (2) Correctly grasp the freight rate policy. In order to better combine the use of motor vehicles and civilian vehicles, administrative methods alone are not enough; more importantly, there must be a correct freight rate policy. The correct freight rate policy should be one that benefits both motor vehicles and civilian vehicles, but does not allow excessive profits, so as not to hinder the exchange of goods or stimulate the blind development of civilian vehicles. In the past, in some areas, many local products could not be transported out due to high freight rates, and the stimulus caused some farmers to "abandon agriculture for transportation," with the saying that "a whip whirls, tens of thousands a day (old currency), even if you don't grow wheat, you can eat white flour"; in some areas, the freight rate was reduced too sharply, and there were phenomena where civilian vehicles were unwilling to participate in transportation because they could not make a profit. The correct freight rate policy should also maintain an appropriate ratio between the freight rates of motor vehicles and civilian vehicles. On the one hand, it should help civilian vehicles to carry out technical improvements, improve transportation operations, and reduce costs and freight rates as much as possible; on the other hand, the short-distance freight rates of motor vehicles should not be set too low, so that cargo owners are willing to use civilian vehicles, overcoming the idea of "rather wait half a month for a motor vehicle than use a horse-drawn carriage for three days." The correct freight rate policy should also maintain an appropriate ratio between the freight rates of highway trunk lines and branch lines, as well as county and township roads, so that civilian vehicles are willing to engage in transportation on branch lines and county and township roads. The correct freight rate policy should take into account the cost of transporting different goods with the same type of vehicle, take into account the difficulty of transportation, and take into account the role of different goods in the national economy and the people's livelihood, changing the method of classifying goods only according to the price of the goods, so as to avoid civilian vehicles only wanting to transport so-called "sweet goods" that are of high value and easy to transport, and not wanting to transport so-called "bitter goods" that are of low value and difficult to transport.
      (3) Correctly resolve the contradictions between various different vehicles. At present, the composition of highway transport capacity is very complex. There are state-owned motor vehicles, vehicles of government agencies and enterprises, professional horse-drawn carriages and human-powered vehicles, and sideline horse-drawn carriages and human-powered vehicles. It is inevitable that contradictions will arise when various different means of transport jointly complete transport tasks in the same transport market. These contradictions are mainly manifested in the competition for goods in the off-season and the competition for roads in the peak season. If not properly resolved, it will waste transport capacity and affect the smooth completion of transport tasks. In order to resolve the contradiction of competition for goods in the off-season, in addition to allocating sources of goods in a planned manner in accordance with the division of labor principles between motor vehicles and civilian vehicles, various professional civilian vehicles should be given priority in the off-season so that they can maintain a normal life; sideline vehicles should be educated not to compete for sources of goods with professional vehicles. In disaster areas, sideline transportation by disaster victims should be given as much consideration as possible, so as to "provide relief through transportation" and "protect livestock through transportation." In order to resolve the contradiction of competition for roads in the peak season, the masses should be mobilized as much as possible to build roads suitable for civilian vehicles to travel on, and some auxiliary roads should be built on both sides of the highways as much as possible; when this is not possible, consideration should also be given to opening up some highway shoulders for civilian vehicles to travel on, but they must be educated to abide by traffic rules and give way to motor vehicles at any time. In the event of urgent large-scale transport tasks, when motor vehicles and civilian vehicles must travel on the same road, the order of travel should be properly arranged according to the road capacity. Last year, in this situation, Cangxian County in Hebei Province stipulated that motor vehicles would transport at night, professional horse-drawn carriages would load goods during the day and travel at 5:00 pm, and rural sideline vehicles would transport during the day.
      (4) Strengthen the socialist transformation and socialist education of civilian vehicles. At present, 80% of the professional animal-drawn vehicle transport industry in the country has embarked on the socialist road to prosperity, forming nearly 2,000 transport cooperatives; some human-powered vehicle and pack animal transport industries have also formed cooperatives or cooperative groups. After cooperativization, animal-drawn vehicles generally increased transport efficiency by 46%, and members' income increased by 33.6%; human-powered vehicle transport efficiency also increased by 7%-15%, and members' income increased by 10%-17%. These transport cooperatives should be continuously rectified and consolidated, helping them to improve their cooperative management level and raise their socialist awareness. Individual professional civilian vehicles should be guided to gradually embark on the socialist road according to needs. In addition, the "three unified" management (unified freight rates, unified sources of goods, unified dispatch) should continue to be strengthened to overcome and prevent the free proliferation of spontaneous capitalist forces. In particular, scattered vehicles that often appear in the peak season should be restricted and managed, and black market transportation should be banned.
      (5) Strengthen the business management of motor vehicle transport enterprises so that they can truly play a leading and backbone role in highway transportation. To this end, a socialist business management system must be conscientiously established, and the socialist awareness of the vast number of employees must be continuously improved. In particular, economic investigation work should be strengthened, the laws of growth and change of passenger and freight flows should be grasped, and dispatch work should be improved based on these laws and the principles of combining the use of motor vehicles and civilian vehicles; the policy of "more, faster, better, and more economical" should be fully implemented, passenger and freight should be cared for in an exemplary manner, driving safety should be ensured, and service attitudes should be improved.

专栏：第一个五年的回顾与前瞻

    把汽车和民间车辆结合使用
    交通部公路总局副局长　朱田顺
    第一个五年计划期间，公路运输部门基本上满足了国民经济的需要。由于国营汽车运输业的经营管理水平不断提高，广大私营运输业及其修理业实行了公私合营，有关部门组织了部分机关企业的汽车参加公用运输，预计到1957年底，汽车运输的货运量将超额50％完成第一个五年计划规定的1957年的指标，比1952年增长383％；汽车客运量将超额108％完成1957年指标，比1952年增长440％；客、货汽车的运输效率将比1952年提高139％，运输成本将降低36．25％。在巩固和扩大汽车运输业的同时，有关部门还对广大的民间车辆实行了适当发展和充分利用的政策。五年当中，大约有80％的公路运量和40％的周转量是由民间车辆完成的。
    公路运输部门在第一个五年中所取得的经验教训是十分丰富的，其中最重要的一条就是必须把汽车和民间车辆结合使用。
    为什么必须这样作呢？主要因为：
    （一）公路客、货运量的增长速度很快。第一个五年计划期间，汽车货运周转量平均每年增长42．6％，客运周转量平均每年增长36．2％。由于我国汽车工业和石油工业还不甚发达，只靠增加汽车来满足需要是有困难的。而我国现有的五百万辆兽力车和一千万辆人力车，是一支巨大的运输力量，应该加以充分利用。这不仅可以弥补汽车运力的不足，还可以增加农业生产合作社的副业收入。
      （二）年度和季节间的运量不平衡。目前在公路的运量构成中，矿物性建筑材料和木材约占45％，农副产品占31％；其余工业品的运量同农业的发展也有很密切的关系。国家建设规模的大小和农业收成的好坏，对公路运量起着决定性的作用。但是，国家的建设规模和农业的收成情况，由于各种客观因素的限制，是不可能年年平衡的。另外，基本建设、农业生产、商业市场也具有很大的季节性。在这种年度和季节运量不平衡的情况下，要想适应客观需要，就必须有一定的后备运力。但是，在我国今天的工业水平和财政情况下，保持相当数量的汽车作为后备运输力量，是有困难的；民间车辆却是一种最可靠的后备运力。它们在运输紧张的年度和运输旺季（运输旺季一般正是农村车辆的停闲季节）具有很大的调节作用。
    （三）解放以前我国公路通车里程只有七万五千公里，现在公路通车里程已达二十二万七千多公里，解放后平均每年增加公路通车里程二万多公里。但是，由于我国幅员广大，目前的公路数量还远不能适应国民经济的需要。由于财力的限制，我们不能在短期内把需要通公路的地方都修通公路，即使修起来，也没有足够的汽车。那些一时还不可能修通公路的地方的物资交流，只有靠当地的民间车辆、甚至驮畜来担负。
    （四）公路运输基本上是一种区间性的短途运输。目前，除西北、西南等边疆地区公路运输还在担负着长距离的干线运输任务以外，在内地各省公路运输的平均运距一般只有九公里左右。民间车辆担负这种短距离的运输任务应该说是力所能及的。在具体分配它们的运输任务的时候，还可以选一些运距更短的货物。例如，目前分配给民间车辆的运输任务的运距，平均只有六公里左右。而且，这样运距很短的货运任务，在目前主要以人力装卸的条件下，使用民间车辆运输比使用汽车还要合算些。
      （五）民间车辆绝大部分固然属于农业生产合作社所有，但从低估计也有约五十万辆专业的兽力车和人力车。估计专门依靠这一职业为生的人口约在二百万人以上。对于这一部分人的生产和生活，是应该加以统筹安排的。
    总之，执行第一个五年计划的经验表明，只有使公路运输部门的职工懂得考虑问题不能脱离国家的总情况、总政策，从而注意适当发展和充分利用民间车辆，将汽车和民间车辆结合使用，才能更好地完成运输任务；任何轻视、排挤甚至企图淘汰民间车辆的思想和做法都是错误的。
    第二个五年计划期间，上述情况将不会发生根本性的变化。今后，为了更好地把汽车和民间车辆结合使用，应该做好以下几项工作：
    （一）妥善安排汽车和民间车辆的分工和协作。在目前我国汽车数量很少的情况下，应该使汽车比较集中地担负那些民间车辆不能担负的运输任务。除暂时还不能通车地区的客、货运任务全部由民间车辆担负以外，县或专区范围内的短距离的运输任务和公路支线的运输任务，也应该组织民间车辆担负，以便腾出汽车从事公路干线的运输。城郊区和同公路平行的短距离的运输任务以及建筑工地的短距离运输任务，也应该组织民间车辆担负，以便充分发挥它们的机动灵活、装卸方便、出入窄街小巷送货上门的优点。某些客运任务繁忙、汽车不足的公路干线的货运任务，也应该尽量组织民间车辆担负，以便腾出汽车从事客运任务。有些建筑工地或物资供应部门的短距离运输任务，即使他们自己有汽车，也应该尽量用“交换车型”的办法，代为组织民间车辆，把他们的汽车替换下来，从事较长途的公路运输任务。这不但可以充分发挥汽车的效能，而且对建筑工地和物资供应部门来说，在经济上也是合算的。此外，为了便利货主，简化运输手续，还应该大力组织汽车和民间车辆的联接运输，使民间车辆为汽车集中和分散货物。
    （二）正确地掌握运价政策。为了更好地结合使用汽车和民间车辆，不能只用行政的方法，更重要的，还要有正确的运价政策。正确的运价政策应该是既使汽车和民间车辆都有利可图，又不能获利过多，以免阻碍物资交流，或者刺激民间车辆盲目发展。过去有些地区由于运价较高，许多土产品运不出来，而且刺激了部分农民“弃农务运”，有所谓“鞭杆一转，一天几万（旧币），不种麦子，也吃白面”的说法；也有些地区由于运价降低过猛，发生过民间车辆无利可图不愿出来参加运输的现象。正确的运价政策还应该使汽车和民间车辆的运价保持适当比例。一方面应该帮助民间车辆进行技术改良，改进运输经营，尽量降低成本和运价；另一方面，汽车的短途运价也不应该规定得太低，以便使货主愿意使用民间车辆，克服“宁等汽车半月，不用马车三天”的思想。正确的运价政策还应该使公路干线和支线以及县乡大道的运价保持适当的比例，以便使民间车辆愿意从事支线和县乡大道的运输。正确的运价政策，应该考虑到同等车辆运输不同货物的成本，考虑到运输的难易，考虑到不同货物在国计民生中的作用，改变只按照货物价格进行货物分等的办法，以免民间车辆只愿运价值高、运输容易的所谓“甜货”，而不愿运价值低、运输较难的所谓“苦货”。
      （三）正确地解决各种不同车辆之间的矛盾。目前公路运力的构成情况是非常复杂的。有国营汽车、机关企业汽车、专业的马车和人力车、副业马车和人力车。各种不同的运输工具在同一运输市场上共同完成运输任务，是难免要发生矛盾的。这种矛盾主要表现为淡季争货，旺季争路。如不适当解决，就会浪费运力，影响运输任务的顺利完成。为了解决淡季争货的矛盾，除了应该按照汽车和民间车辆的分工原则有计划地分配货源以外，在淡季应该首先照顾各种专业的民间车辆，使他们能够维持正常生活；应该教育副业车辆不要和专业车辆争夺货源。在灾区，应该尽量照顾灾民的副业运输，做到“以运代赈”和“以运保畜”。为了解决旺季争路的矛盾，应该尽量发动群众修筑适合民间车辆行驶的道路，在公路两旁尽量修些副道；不可能时也应该考虑开放一些公路路肩，供民间车辆行驶，但是必须教育他们遵守交通规则，随时给汽车让路。遇有紧急的大批运输任务，汽车和民间车辆必须在同一道路上行驶时，应该根据道路通过能力，妥善安排行车次序。去年河北沧县地区在这种情况下，就曾规定汽车夜间运输，专业马车白天装货下午五时行车，农村副业车辆白天运输。
      （四）加强对民间车辆的社会主义改造和社会主义教育。目前全国已经有80％的专业兽力车运输业走上了社会主义的康庄大道，组成了近两千个运输合作社；一部分人力车和驮畜运输业也组成了合作社或合作小组。合作化以后，兽力车一般提高运输效率46％，社员收入增加33．6％，人力车运输效率也提高7％—15％，社员收入增加10％—17％。对于这批运输合作社应该不断地加以整顿和巩固，帮助他们提高办社水平，提高社会主义觉悟。对于专业的个体民间车辆，应该根据需要引导它们逐步走上社会主义道路。此外，还应该继续加强三统管理（统一运价，统一货源，统一调度），克服和防止资本主义自发势力自由泛滥。特别对那些在旺季经常出现的流散车辆，更应该加以限制和管理，取缔黑市运输。
      （五）加强汽车运输企业的经营管理，使它们在公路运输中真正起带头和骨干作用。为此，就必须认真树立社会主义的经营管理制度，不断提高广大职工的社会主义觉悟。特别要加强经济调查工作，掌握客、货流的增长变化规律，根据这一规律以及汽车和民间车辆结合使用的原则，改进调度工作；全面贯彻多、快、好、省的方针，模范地爱护客、货，保证行车安全，改进服务态度。
