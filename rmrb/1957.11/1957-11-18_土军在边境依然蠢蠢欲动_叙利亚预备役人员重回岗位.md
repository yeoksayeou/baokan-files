Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, November 17th: Following the order of the Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Bizri, Syrian reservists of the 19th detachment returned to their posts in the army on the 16th. They received weapons and will undergo military training.

Damascus, Homs, and other cities in Syria continue to conduct military training for residents in case of possible aggression.

Reports received here indicate that provocations by Turkish aircraft and patrols on the northern border of Syria have not decreased in recent days. Recently, a lieutenant captain of a Turkish patrol was captured by the Syrian side.

Syrian officials commented on the current situation on the 16th, saying that although the overall international situation is now relatively stable, "Syria will still consider the situation dangerous unless Turkish troops withdraw from the border." These officials said that Syria is watching the situation and is prepared to defend its territory.
Xinhua News Agency, November 17th: TASS, Moscow: "Red Star" reported today that the danger of military conflict still exists on the Turkish-Syrian border. There is still a large number of Turkish troops on the Turkish-Syrian border. Turkish troops are conducting unusual movements along the border. Turkish soldiers are constantly making provocative attacks on Syrian villages. American and Turkish aircraft frequently intrude into Syrian airspace. The U.S. Sixth Fleet is conducting military demonstrations in the Eastern Mediterranean.

Colonel Likin said in the article that the United States is turning Turkey into a bridgehead for aggression against the Soviet Union and other socialist countries. Since 1952, the Turkish army has been preparing for a war using weapons of mass destruction. Military airfields, radar stations, communication networks, pipelines, gasoline depots, port facilities, etc., are being built in Turkey. American and British aircraft have obtained the right to fly in Turkish airspace and to use Turkish air bases. The Turkish government allows American troops equipped with atomic weapons to be stationed in its territory.

The article concludes by saying that those fanatical military adventurers are unwilling to understand that saber-rattling, especially in areas close to the Soviet border, is a dangerous game that will not bring any good results to the imperialists and their lackeys.

    土军在边境依然蠢蠢欲动
    叙利亚预备役人员重回岗位
    新华社大马士革17日电　根据军队总司令比兹里的命令，叙利亚十九队预备役人员在16日回到了他们在部队中的岗位。他们领到了武器，并且将接受军事训练。
    大马士革、霍姆斯和叙利亚其他城市继续在对居民进行军事训练，以防可能发生的侵略。
    这里得到的消息表明，土耳其的飞机和巡逻队在叙利亚北部边境上的挑衅，这些天来并没有减少。最近有一个土耳其巡逻队的中尉队长被叙利亚方面捕获。
    叙利亚官方人士16日评论目前形势时说，虽然总的国际形势现在较为安定，“但是，除非土耳其军队从边境撤退，叙利亚将仍旧认为局势是危险的”。这些人士说，叙利亚正注视着局势，并且准备保卫自己的领土。
  新华社17日讯　塔斯社莫斯科讯：“红星报”今天说，在土耳其—叙利亚边境上仍然有发生军事冲突的危险。土叙边境上仍然有着大量土耳其军队。土耳其军队沿着边境进行不平常的调动。土耳其士兵不断向叙利亚的村庄进行挑衅性的攻击。美国和土耳其飞机经常侵入叙利亚领空。美国第六舰队在地中海东部进行军事示威。
    利金上校在文章中说，美国把土耳其变成对苏联和其他社会主义国家进行侵略的桥头堡。从1952年起，土耳其军队就准备进行使用大规模毁灭性武器的战争。在土耳其境内正在建设军用机场、雷达站、通讯网、输送管、汽油库、港口设备等等。美国和英国的飞机获得了在土耳其领空飞行的权利以及使用土耳其空军基地的权利。土耳其政府允许配备有原子武器的美国军队驻扎在自己境内。
    文章最后说，那些狂热的军事冒险家无论如何也不愿意了解，剑拔弩张的做法，尤其是在紧靠苏联边境的地区这样做，是一种危险的玩意儿，这不会给帝国主义者及其仆从带来什么好结果。
