    The Soviet Union, Like a Radiant Beacon, Illuminates Humanity's Path Forward
    Celebrating the 40th Anniversary of the October Revolution
    Banchen Erdini
    Today, the working people of the whole world are celebrating the 40th anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution in the Soviet Union with infinite joy, excitement and gratitude. The Soviet Union, like a radiant beacon, illuminates the path of human progress. Now the cause of socialism is flourishing, the people's movement in various countries of the world is unprecedentedly high, and the camp of peace, democracy and socialism is more prosperous and stronger. Today, on this great festival, I, on behalf of the religious and secular people of Tibet, extend my heartfelt congratulations to our great ally, the strong fortress of world peace - the great Soviet Union and the great Soviet people who are victoriously building communism.
    For forty years, under the wise and correct leadership of the great revolutionary teacher Lenin and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Soviet people have established the first socialist country in human history, transforming the Soviet Union from a backward agricultural country into an advanced industrial country, turning the scientific socialist ideal into a living reality, opening up the road to liberation for the proletariat and working people of the world, and setting a brilliant example. Now the Soviet people are confidently marching towards the most ideal society of modern mankind—communist society. After overfulfilling the Fifth Five-Year Plan for National Economic Development, the Soviet people are victoriously fulfilling the Sixth Five-Year Plan with unparalleled enthusiasm for labor. The Soviet Union has achieved rapid development in industrial and agricultural production, culture and education. In particular, it has achieved unprecedented development in culture and science. The success of artificial earth satellites and intercontinental missiles fully demonstrates that the Soviet Union has surpassed the United States in the field of science and technology and ranks first in the world. This irrefutably proves the strength of the Soviet Union, the fortress of world peace. In short, the great achievements of the Soviet Union in the past 40 years fully demonstrate the superiority of the socialist system.
    The great achievements of the Soviet people in building socialism and communism and in maintaining world peace have powerfully inspired the struggle of progressive mankind all over the world for peace, democracy and socialism. It has not only freed the people of the socialist camp from the enslavement of fascism and the bloody rule of British and American imperialism, and established their own people's regime, but also, with the support and help of the great internationalist spirit of the Soviet Union, the politics, economy, and culture of various countries have been vigorously developed, and the deep friendship between the socialist camp countries has been consolidated day by day. In particular, the great achievements of the Soviet Union in culture and science have more powerfully strengthened the forces of defending peace. If the mad imperialist aggressors dare to launch a war, they will surely walk the road to death. The superiority of the socialist system is a great encouragement to the people of all countries who are striving to get rid of feudalism and capitalism and who are fighting against colonialism for national independence and liberation. In the future, we should further strengthen the fraternal friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people, consolidate the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, strengthen the unity of the proletariat and all peace-loving people in the world, and strive for new victories in the cause of human progress and the defense of world peace along the brilliant road of the October Revolution.
    The people of our country have a particularly deep understanding of the significance of the October Revolution. In the revolutionary struggle before liberation and in the construction cause after liberation, the Soviet Union's revolutionary and construction experience and its fraternal concern and assistance have always been one of the sources of our strength. Since the founding of our country, the great achievements made in restoring and developing the national economy, improving our country's international status, maintaining world peace and promoting human progress are inseparable from the cooperation with the Soviet Union and the socialist camp countries, especially the assistance from the Soviet Union. The Soviet people, in the spirit of great internationalism, have given us long-term, comprehensive, systematic and selfless assistance. This is an unprecedented initiative in world history. The Soviet Union's assistance to our country is a manifestation of a completely new type of fraternal cooperation. This cooperation is not only conducive to the prosperity and progress of our two countries, but also conducive to world peace and the happiness of all mankind. We, the people of Tibet, like the people of all ethnic groups in the country, express our heartfelt gratitude to our great ally, the Soviet Union, and the great Soviet people for the assistance they have given to the Chinese people.
    The unbreakable friendship between China and the Soviet Union guarantees our past victories and will surely guarantee our present and future victories. We must cherish this greatest friendship as we cherish our own eyes. We must do everything possible to further consolidate and develop the deep friendship between the two countries. We must work harder to learn from the various advanced experiences of the Soviet people and the spirit of hard work and thrift in national construction of the Soviet people, so as to strengthen the confidence of our people in building a socialist society and strive to build our motherland into a prosperous, strong, glorious and brilliant socialist country.
    The iron-like facts since liberation prove that without the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and without a strong socialist motherland, there could be no prosperous and happy new Tibet. Therefore, we, the people of Tibet, must vow to further consolidate the close unity within Tibet and between the Han and Tibetan nationalities under the correct and wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, strengthen practical actions against imperialism and patriotism, be vigilant against the subversive activities and alienation and sabotage of imperialism and separatists, actively do a good job in the various tasks of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, thoroughly implement the agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet, follow all the instructions and resolutions of the Central Committee, and strive to build a prosperous and happy new Tibet for the motherland.

    苏联像光芒万丈的灯塔照亮人类前进的道路
    庆祝十月革命四十周年
    班禅额尔德尼
    今天，全世界的劳动人民都怀着无限喜悦兴奋和感激的心情，来庆祝伟大的苏联十月社会主义革命四十周年。苏联像光芒万丈的灯塔一样照亮着人类前进的道路。现在社会主义的事业蒸蒸日上，世界各国的人民运动空前高涨，和平民主社会主义阵营是更加繁荣和强大了。今天欣逢这个伟大的节日，我谨代表西藏僧俗人民向我们伟大的盟邦世界和平的坚强堡垒——伟大的苏联和正在胜利地建设共产主义的伟大的苏联人民表示衷心的祝贺。
    四十年来，苏联人民在伟大的革命导师列宁和苏联共产党英明正确的领导下，建立了人类历史上第一个社会主义国家，把苏联从落后的农业国变为先进的工业国，把科学的社会主义理想变成了活生生的现实，给全世界无产阶级和劳动人民开辟了解放的道路，树立了光辉的榜样。现在苏联人民正在满怀信心地向着现代人类最理想的社会——共产主义社会迈进。苏联人民在超额完成了第五个国民经济的五年计划以后，正在以无比的劳动热情胜利地完成着第六个五年计划。苏联的工农业生产和文化教育等方面都已获得了飞跃的发展，尤其是在文化科学方面更是获得了空前的发展，人造地球卫星和洲际导弹的成功更充分地标志着苏联在科学技术领域中已超过了美国而跃居世界首位，这就无可辩驳地证明了世界和平堡垒苏联的强大。总之，苏联四十年来的伟大成就充分地显示了社会主义制度的优越性。
    苏联人民在建设社会主义、共产主义社会和维护世界和平的事业中所获得的巨大成就，有力地鼓舞着全世界的进步人类为和平民主和社会主义事业所进行的斗争，它不仅使今天社会主义阵营国家的人民免除了法西斯的奴役和美英帝国主义的血腥统治，建立了人民自己的政权，而且在苏联国际主义的伟大精神支持和帮助下，各国的政治、经济、文化等都得到了蓬勃的发展，社会主义阵营各国之间的深厚友谊也日益巩固，尤其是苏联文化科学方面的伟大成就就更加有力地壮大了保卫和平的力量，疯狂的帝国主义侵略者如果敢于发动战争，就一定要走到死亡的道路，社会主义制度的优越性，对于正在力求摆脱封建主义和资本主义统治以及正在反对殖民主义争取民族独立解放的各国人民是很大的鼓舞，今后我们更应进一步加强中苏两国人民兄弟般的友谊，巩固以苏联为首的社会主义阵营，加强全世界无产阶级和一切爱好和平人民的团结，沿着十月革命光辉的道路，为争取人类进步事业和保卫世界和平的新胜利而奋斗。
    我国人民对十月革命的意义有特别深刻的体会，在解放以前的革命斗争中和解放以后的建设事业中，苏联革命的和建设的经验以及它的兄弟般的关切和援助始终是我们力量的泉源之一。我国建国以来在恢复和发展国民经济提高我国的国际地位、维护世界和平和促进人类进步方面所取得的巨大成就是同苏联和社会主义阵营国家的合作特别是和苏联的援助分不开的，苏联人民本着伟大的国际主义精神给予了我们以长期的全面的系统的无私的援助，这在世界历史上是从来没有过的创举，苏联对我国的援助是完全新型的兄弟般的合作关系的体现，这种合作不仅有利于我们两个国家的繁荣和进步，而且也有利于世界和平和全人类的幸福，我们西藏人民和全国各族人民一样以感激心情对伟大盟邦苏联和伟大的苏联人民给予我们中国人民的这种援助表示最衷心的感谢。
    中苏两国牢不可破的友谊保证了我们过去的胜利，也一定会保证现在和将来的胜利。我们必须同爱护自己眼珠一样地来保卫这个最伟大的友谊，我们要尽一切努力来进一步巩固和发展两国之间的深厚友谊，要更加努力地学习苏联人民的各种先进经验和苏联人民艰苦奋斗、勤俭建国的精神，以加强我国人民建设社会主义社会的信心，为把我们祖国建设成为一个繁荣富强光辉灿烂的社会主义国家而努力。
    解放以来铁一般的事实证明，没有中国共产党和毛主席的正确领导，没有强大的社会主义祖国，也就不可能有繁荣幸福的新西藏。因此，我们西藏人民就必须永誓在中国共产党和毛主席正确英明的领导下，进一步巩固西藏内部和汉藏民族之间的亲密大团结，加强反帝爱国的实际行动，警惕帝国主义与分离分子的颠覆活动和离间破坏，积极做好西藏自治区筹委会的各项工作，彻底执行和平解放西藏办法的协议，遵循中央的一切指示和决议，为建设祖国的繁荣幸福的新西藏而奋斗。
