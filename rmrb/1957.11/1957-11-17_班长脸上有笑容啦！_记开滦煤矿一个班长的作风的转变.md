"The Squad Leader is Smiling!"
    --A Record of the Transformation of a Squad Leader's Work Style in the Kailuan Coal Mine
    By Our Correspondent Zhong Lin
    In the Kailuan Coal Mine's Tangshan Mine, in the Ninth Haulage Area's electric locomotive six-point shift, more than twenty workers, through the media of big-character posters, group meetings, and discussion sessions, raised more than twenty opinions about the work style of their squad leader, Tang Changyou.
    "Squad Leader Tang is subjective in seeing problems, glares and scolds people. He wants to be the only one who makes decisions about everything. He criticizes people without understanding the situation, making them work with burdens on their backs…"
    "When accidents occur, Squad Leader Tang loses his temper without analyzing the causes. No one who drives electric locomotives in the Ninth Haulage Area isn't afraid of him. Usually, when people are chatting together, they leave as soon as he arrives…"
    "Once, Squad Leader Tang asked Xu Man to lead a mule, but Xu Man didn't know how to harness a mule. Tang lost his temper and said: 'If you can't do it, go home!'"
    "…………"
    When the mine announced the start of the rectification campaign, although Old Tang listened to the Party Committee Secretary's report on the rectification campaign, he thought that the fight against the "three great isms" had little to do with him, so he still held a "nothing much" attitude. Now, with more than twenty out of the whole shift of thirty or so people criticizing him, he felt a lot of pressure, his heart like fifteen buckets drawing water – going up and down. He thought: "To be honest, I've always been active in my work, how could I have offended so many people and caused so many problems? This is too embarrassing!" He pondered the workers' opinions over and over, and suddenly realized that everyone hadn't raised any opinions about his production management; the opinions raised were mostly related to his work style. The workers particularly had complaints about his losing his temper and putting on airs in the anti-accident struggle. He thought: "If you're afraid of the anti-accident struggle, then don't have accidents! You complain that I'm anxious, but you don't care about the mine's production, so of course you're not anxious; if I wasn't anxious, wouldn't there be even more accidents? Could the production tasks still be completed? …"
    Throughout the entire haulage area, the vast majority of squad leaders were criticized by name by the masses during this high tide of the Great Blooming and Great Contending. The Party General Branch convened meetings of all the squad leaders more than once, educating them to adopt a correct attitude towards the criticisms of the masses, to listen to the opinions of the masses with an open mind, and to boldly, resolutely, and thoroughly rectify their work style and improve their work. What to do? Old Tang thought for a long time but still couldn't figure it out. He went to a leading comrade in the haulage area and asked: "Do you think I should change from the perspective of production management, or from the perspective of work style? …" He always believed that if he grasped production management tightly, his work style would naturally have to be a little "hard"; if his work style was to be changed to be "soft," wouldn't production management become lax? Then how could the tasks be completed? The comrades of the Party General Branch understood Old Tang's thinking and talked to him again, affirming that his spirit of being active and responsible in his work was good, but also pointing out his serious shortcomings of being divorced from the masses and not knowing how to follow the mass line, telling him that he must humbly accept the criticisms of the masses, even if only 1% of a certain criticism was correct, it should be accepted. The comrades of the Party General Branch also wanted him to think carefully: What is the purpose of working actively? What results are obtained by being so rude to the masses? If one really wants to improve production, what should one do?
    Old Tang, who has always been quick-tempered, now spent a lot of brainpower considering the questions raised by the comrades of the Party General Branch. He asked himself over and over again, constantly pondering the answers.
    He recalled the process of electric locomotive driver Zhang En having accidents on two consecutive days. Once, when Zhang En was driving underground, he was talking and laughing with others, and accidentally crashed the car, breaking his nose. When he came up to the well to hold a meeting to check the accident, Old Tang was very angry. He thought: "There is no reason to talk if you are injured while joking? If you have an accident, the superiors will criticize me, how embarrassing is that!" So he was furious and severely criticized Zhang En. However, such severe criticism did not help Zhang En correct his shortcomings, but instead put a heavy burden on his back. When he worked the next day, his emotions were very bad and he was not very focused, resulting in another accident and injuring his hand.
    Old Tang also thought of a dispute that occurred with Li Bingqian last winter. That day, Old Tang went to the underground dispatch room for something and heard electric locomotive drivers Li Bingqian and Li Tonglin talking outside:
    "Where are you going?" Li Bingqian asked.
    "Going to a meeting to fight accidents! Don't you have to go too?" Li Tonglin asked back.
    "I don't want to go, it's useless to go. Anyway, Squad Leader Tang has the final say. …" Li Bingqian said.
    As soon as Old Tang heard them talking about him, he rushed out of the door aggressively. Li Tonglin saw that the situation was not good and left.
    "If you have any opinions, raise them in person, why are you cursing in private?" Old Tang asked Li Bingqian.
    "Your bureaucracy is too serious, I dare not raise it, so I have to say it in private, but I didn't curse." Li Bingqian retorted without showing any weakness.
    "Okay! You don't say it in person, you engage in small cliques…" Before Old Tang could finish his sentence, Li Bingqian became even more anxious when he heard about "engaging in small cliques," and pulled Old Tang, wanting him to explain clearly what he meant by engaging in small cliques. The two quarreled endlessly. The matter was brought to the haulage area director and the Party General Branch Secretary. The leading comrades talked to Old Tang, criticizing him for saying that other comrades were engaging in small cliques. Later, a special meeting was convened to deal with the matter, and Old Tang admitted that it was wrong to say that others were engaging in small cliques. This time, although Old Tang learned a lesson about being careful in his speech and not using big labels to put pressure on people, he had not fundamentally realized the seriousness of his detachment from the masses.
    On another occasion, electric locomotive driver Li Tonglin had an accident underground and injured his head. When he came up to the well to hold a meeting to check the accident, Li Tonglin had only said a few words when Old Tang could no longer contain his anger. He said that what Li Tonglin was saying was not realistic, and Li Tonglin also raised his voice to defend himself, and the two quarreled, and the meeting ended without results. Afterwards, Li Tonglin was recuperating at home, and the haulage area director and the shift supervisor called Old Tang to go to Li Tonglin's house to visit him. This moved Li Tonglin very much. After going back to work, Li Tonglin not only examined his shortcomings and his responsibility in the accident, but also said that he would work hard, pay attention to safety, and strive not to have such an accident again.
    After carefully thinking about these things, Old Tang realized that every time he lost his temper and put on airs with the workers, he did not get things done well, and did not reduce accidents. In the past, when accidents occurred, he did not rely on everyone to investigate, study, analyze, and discuss in order to achieve a unified understanding and accept the lessons that should be learned; instead, he always lost his temper, put on airs, and scolded people, making the people who had accidents work with burdens on their backs, making them feel unhappy and reducing their enthusiasm for production. Did the workers want to have accidents? Why hadn't he been able to understand this before? Li Tonglin was recuperating at home, and the area director and the shift supervisor called him to visit him, which moved him to examine his mistakes and promise to work hard. Why didn't he learn from this good work style and improve his relationship with his worker comrades? Old Tang made up his mind: he would no longer lose his temper, no longer make simple and crude mistakes, and consult with the masses in everything, and learn to follow the mass line.
    However, when the Party General Branch called on every leading cadre who had been criticized by the masses to make a public self-criticism within an appropriate scope, and resolutely correct their shortcomings and mistakes, Old Tang began to hesitate again. He thought: "Changing is fine, but why must I make a public self-criticism to everyone? It's so embarrassing to lower my head and admit my mistakes in front of everyone! How can I lead them and tell them to do this and that in the future?" He still had these concerns and did not have the courage to publicly criticize his shortcomings to the masses.
    Later, at the general meeting of all employees in the haulage area, the area director took the lead in examining his own shortcomings. Some squad leaders in other squads also made public self-criticisms in their own squads. The reaction of the masses of employees was very good. Under the urging of the Party General Branch and the haulage area, Old Tang convened a meeting of all the members of his shift to make a public self-criticism, and also shook hands with the workers with whom he had had gaps and apologized. After holding this meeting, not only did no one look down on Old Tang, but on the contrary, everyone became closer to Old Tang.
    Soon, a car-dropping and car-shifting accident occurred in the shift, and some people were worried about whether Old Tang would lose his temper again. But when the accident investigation meeting was held, Old Tang did not start by scowling and raging as he had done in the past. He first asked the people involved to talk about the course of the accident and the results of the investigation, and then asked everyone to analyze the causes of the accident and put forward suggestions for handling it. He himself also spoke calmly and discussed with everyone. This meeting not only unified everyone's understanding of the problem and made appropriate handling of the accident, but also discovered the problem of the lack of uniformity in the switching lines. After reporting it to the superiors, technicians went to survey and improve it the next day.
    Now, workers are also willing to take the initiative to talk to Old Tang. Li Tonghai found a problem with the ditch and quickly told Old Tang. Li Bingqian, who had argued with Old Tang, also took the initiative to report problems in his work to Old Tang. Liu Defu had a gap with Old Tang over the matter of asking for leave. Now, not only can he tell Old Tang about his own affairs, but also because he is a member of the trade union, he also goes to Old Tang to discuss some matters related to the trade union members of his shift.
    Old Tang, not only is his attitude towards the workers in his own shift amiable, but his attitude towards the workers in other shifts is also amiable. In the past, when it was time to get off work, people from various areas and shifts gathered in the underground station, some rushing to get on the train, and some even getting on the train with electricity when the train was moving. Once Old Tang saw this situation in the field and shouted loudly, "Why don't you keep order! Why aren't you paying attention to safety!" No one paid any attention to him, and one person said coldly, "Didn't you get electrocuted!" Old Tang became angry and said: "I'm doing it for your own good, but you don't listen, do I fear you?" He was so angry that he ordered the electric locomotive driver: "They don't listen, don't drive!" He and some workers from other shifts also had gaps because of this. Recently, when it was time to get off work, the station was also crowded with people, and some people were rushing to get on the train. Old Tang said to everyone in a tone of discussion: "Comrades, we have many people and few cars, don't rush to get on, it will take more time if there is an accident. Let's all get on in order, and we will all be able to leave in a while, everyone don't rush to get on, okay?" Everyone said, "Okay!" and no one rushed to get on the train.
    The relationship between Old Tang and all the members of his shift is becoming more and more harmonious. Everyone is also implementing the rules and regulations better. The number of accidents that occurred during underground transportation in the whole shift has also decreased compared to the past. The production tasks have been overfulfilled every day these days. Since he became a squad leader, Old Tang has never felt so happy as he does now.
    The workers reflected: "The rectification movement is really good, our Squad Leader Tang has also changed his temper. He used to always do things with a straight face, but now, there is a smile on his face!"

    “班长脸上有笑容啦！”
    ——记开滦煤矿一个班长的作风的转变
    本报记者  钟林
    开滦煤矿唐山矿井下运输区九道行电车六点班的二十多个职工，在大鸣大放中，通过大字报、小组会和座谈会，对他们的班长唐长友的作风，提了二十多条意见。
    “唐班长看问题主观，对人吹胡子瞪眼，什么事只许他说了算，他不弄清情况就批评人，使人背着包袱干活……。”
    “唐班长在发生事故的时候不分析原因就大发脾气，九道行开电车的人没有不怕他的。平时大家在一起聊天，他一去人家就走开了……。”
    “有一回唐班长叫徐满拉骡子，徐满不会套骡子，唐就发脾气说：你干不了就回家去吧！”
    “…………。”
    在矿上宣布开始整风的时候，老唐虽然听了党委书记作的整风动员报告，但他以为反三大主义跟他自己的关系不太大，所以还抱着“没有什么”的态度。现在，全班三十来个人，就有二十多个对他提出批评，他感觉到压力很大，心里像十五个吊桶打水，七上八下的。他想道：“凭良心说，自己一向都是积极地干工作呀，怎么会得罪了这么多人，给闹上这么多毛病呢？这太丢人啦！”他一遍又一遍地琢磨着工人的意见，忽然发现大家对他在生产管理方面并没有提出什么意见，提的这些意见多是属于作风方面的，工人们特别对他在反事故斗争中发脾气、耍态度有意见。他心里想：“你们怕反事故斗争那就别出事故呀！你们嫌我着急，你们不关心全矿的生产当然就不着急啦；我要不着急，事故还少得了吗？生产任务还能完成吗？……”。
    在整个运输区里，绝大部分的班长在这次大鸣大放高潮当中，都被群众指名批评了。党总支不止一次地召集所有的班长开会，教育他们要采取正确的态度对待群众的批评，要虚心听取群众的意见，并且要大胆地、坚决地、彻底地整顿作风，改进工作。怎么办呢？老唐想了许久还是没有想通。他跑到运输区的一位领导同志那里去问道：“你看我是从生产管理上改呀，还是从作风上改？……”。他总认为在生产管理上抓得紧，作风上自然就要“硬”一点；如果作风要改“软”，生产管理上岂不就要松了吗？那怎么能完得成任务呢？党总支的同志了解老唐的想法，又找他谈话，肯定了他在工作中积极负责的精神是好的，也指出他脱离群众、不会走群众路线的严重缺点，告诉他一定要虚心接受群众的批评，哪怕某项批评只有1％是对的也应当接受。党总支的同志还要他好好考虑一下：积极工作的目的是为了什么？对群众的态度那么粗暴又得到什么结果？如果真正为了搞好生产，该怎么办才好？
    向来性子很急的老唐，现在很费了一番脑筋考虑党总支的同志提出的问题来。他翻来复去地问自己，不断地思索着答案。
    他想起了井下电车司机张恩连续两天发生事故的经过来。有一次，张恩在井下开车的时候跟旁人说笑，一不小心撞了车，把鼻子碰破了。上井开会检查事故的时候，老唐心里十分冒火，他寻思：“你开玩笑碰伤了还有什么道理讲？你出了事故上级就要批评我，这叫我多丢脸啊！”于是就大发雷霆，严厉地把张恩指责了一顿。可是，这样严厉的指责并没有帮助张恩纠正缺点，反而使他背上了沉重的包袱，第二天干活的时候情绪很不好，精神很不集中，结果又发生了一次事故，把手碰伤了。
    老唐又想到去年冬天跟李丙千发生的一次纠纷。那天，老唐有事到井下调车室去，听见电车司机李丙千和李桐林在外面说话：
    “你上哪儿去呀？”李丙千问。
    “开会反事故去呀！你不是也得去么？”李桐林反问道。
    “我才不高兴去哩，去了不也是白搭吗？反正是唐班长说了算。……”李丙千说。
    老唐一听他们在议论自己，就气势汹汹地冲出门来。李桐林见势不妙就走了。
    “你有意见当面提呀，为什么在背地骂大街？”老唐朝着李丙千就问开了。
      “你的官僚主义太严重了，我不敢提，只好背地说说呗，可是并没有骂大街。”李丙千也不示弱地给顶了回来。
    “好啊！你们当面不说，背地搞小团体……”。老唐的话还没有说完，李丙千一听说“搞小团体”就更着急了，拉着老唐就要他给说清楚，到底怎么叫搞小团体。两个人争吵不休。事情闹到运输区区长和党总支书记那里。领导同志们找老唐谈了话，批评他不该乱说别的同志搞小团体。后来，又专门召集了一次会议来处理这件事，老唐承认了说别人搞小团体是错误的。这次，老唐虽然得到了说话要谨慎、不能乱用大帽子压人的教训，但他还没有从根本上认识到自己脱离群众的严重性。
    又有一次，电车司机李桐林在井下开车出了事故，把头碰伤了。上井开会检查事故的时候，李桐林刚说了还没有几句，老唐的火气就按捺不住了，他说李桐林讲的不切合实际，李桐林也高声起来辩护，两个人就争吵起来了，会议无结果而散。事后，李桐林在家里养伤，运输区的区长和值班长叫了老唐一起到李桐林家里去慰问他。这使李桐林很受感动。上班以后，李桐林不仅检讨了自己的缺点和自己在发生事故当中的责任，还表示要好好干活，注意安全，争取不再发生这种事故。
    仔细想了这些事，老唐认识到：自己每回对工人群众发脾气、耍态度的结果，并没有把事情办好，并没有使事故减少。过去出了事故，自己不依靠大家调查研究、分析讨论，以取得统一的认识，接受应有的教训；却老是发脾气、耍态度，训斥人一顿，使出了事故的人背上包袱干活，思想上不痛快，生产情绪不高。难道是工人愿意出事故吗？自己从前为什么体谅不到这一点呢？李桐林在家里养伤，区长和值班长叫着自己到他家里看望他，却感动得他检讨了错误，保证要好好工作。自己为什么不好好学习这种好的作风，改进跟工人同志们的关系呢？老唐打定主意：以后不再发脾气，不再犯简单、粗暴的毛病了，遇事要跟群众商量，要学会走群众路线才对。
    可是，当党总支号召每一个受到群众批评的领导干部，都应当在适当的范围内当众作检讨，并坚决改正自己的缺点和错误的时候，老唐心里又嘀咕起来了。他想：“改就改吧，何必一定要公开向大家作检讨呢？在大家面前低头认错，脸上热辣辣的多丢人呀！以后还怎么领导他们，叫他们干这干那呢？”他还存在着这些顾虑，没有勇气去向群众公开检讨自己的缺点。
    后来，在运输区的全体职工大会上，区长带头检讨了他自己的缺点。其他班有的班长也在他们本班里当众作了检讨。职工群众的反应很好。在党总支和运输区的催促下，老唐才召集全班人开会公开作检讨，还向过去有过隔阂的工人握手道歉。开了这次会以后，全班的人不仅没有谁看不起老唐，相反的，大家跟老唐都更亲近起来了。
    不久，班上发生了一次丢车、排车事故，有的人耽心老唐是否又会发脾气。但在开事故检查会的时候，老唐并不像以前那样一开场就扳着脸孔大发雷霆了。他先让有关的人讲事故发生的经过和调查的结果，再让大家分析事故发生的原因，提出处理意见。他自己也心平气和地发言，跟大家一起进行讨论。这次会不仅统一了大家对问题的认识，对事故作了适当的处理，而且还发现了换车线不统一的问题，经向上级反映以后，第二天就有技术员去着手勘测、改进了。
    现在，工人们有事也愿意主动地去找老唐谈了。李桐海发现道沟有问题，就赶快告诉了老唐。跟老唐吵过架的李丙千，工作中有了问题也主动向老唐汇报。刘德富为了请假的事跟老唐有过隔阂，现在不仅自己有事能够告诉老唐，而且因为他是工会委员，有关本班工会会员的一些事情，他也去找老唐商量了。
    老唐呢，不仅对本班的工人态度和蔼了，而且对其他班的工人的态度也和蔼了。从前下班的时候，井下车场上聚集着各区各班的人，有的人抢着上车，有的人甚至在电车行进的时候带电上车。有一次老唐在场看见这种情形，就大声嚷着
  “你们为什么不守秩序呀！你们为什么不注意安全呀！”大家都没有答理他，有个人还冷言冷语地说：“不是没有电着你吗！”老唐发火了，说：
  “我为了你们好，你们却不听，难道我怕你们吗？”他气得给电车司机下命令：“他们不听话不行，你别开车！”他和其他班的一些工人也因此有了隔阂了。最近有一次下班的时候，车场上也挤满了人，也有人抢着上车。老唐用商量的口吻跟大家说：“同志们，咱们人多车小，不要抢着上啊，出了事故就更耽误时间了，咱们都按先后次序上，一会儿就都可以走完了，大家谁也不要抢着上车好不好？”大家说：“好！”也就没人抢着上车了。
    老唐和全班人的关系日愈融洽起来。大家对规程制度也执行得比较好了。全班在井下运输当中发生的事故也比从前减少了。生产任务这些日子天天超额完成。老唐在生产管理工作上也顺利得多了，他当班长以来，心里从来没有像现在这样痛快过。
    工人们反映说：“整风运动真是好，我们的唐班长那么大的脾气也改掉了。他过去总是扳着脸孔办事，现在，他的脸上也有了笑容啦！”
