Xinhua News Agency, 26th: According to the "Guangming Daily" report: On the 25th, the heads of the central committees of China's democratic parties gave statements to the "Guangming Daily" reporter, warmly endorsing the "Declaration of the Representatives of the Communist and Workers' Parties of Socialist Countries" and the "Peace Declaration" of the Communist and Workers' Parties representatives' conference. They were deeply encouraged by these two great declarations and firmly believed that the future belongs to communism, and peace will surely triumph over war. They are determined to, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, carry out fundamental transformation of individuals and organizations, and contribute all their strength to the great cause of communism.

    Li Jishen, Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, said that these two declarations embody the great international solidarity of the peace, democracy, and socialist camp centered on the Soviet Union, demonstrate the unparalleled strength of the socialist countries in defending peace, and express the common aspirations of progressive mankind and all peace-loving people around the world. For the aggressive bloc headed by U.S. imperialism, it is a powerful warning. If they disregard the serious significance of this warning and continue to implement their reactionary policies, they will be like moths flying into a flame, bringing about their own destruction.

    These two declarations have further illuminated our path forward and further enhanced our confidence that the future belongs to socialism and peace will triumph over war. We are determined to always follow the Chinese Communist Party and take the goals revealed by these two declarations as the guide and direction of our actions, contributing all our strength to the great cause of striving for peace, progress, and socialism. Our most pressing task at present is to deepen and accelerate the anti-rightist struggle within the party in order to achieve a comprehensive and thorough victory in the anti-rightist struggle. Only in this way can we transform ourselves into a political force truly serving socialism and shoulder the extremely glorious tasks entrusted to us by this great era.

    Shen Junru, Chairman of the China Democratic League, believes that these two declarations are historical documents of great revolutionary significance. They mark the great vitality of the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, a new stage in the international unity of the communist movement, and a change in the balance of power between peace and war, socialism and imperialism, with a significant advantage for the forces of peace and socialism. He said that the working people of the world and all peace-loving people can draw infinite confidence and courage from these two revolutionary documents. The Chinese people must, under the leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party, make new and greater contributions to the cause of building socialism, to consolidating the unity and cooperation of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and to the struggle against imperialism and in defense of peace.

    Huang Yanpei, Chairman of the China Democratic National Construction Association, said that these two great declarations are the common program of the socialist camp and a guide to action for people all over the world who oppose war and strive for peace. For the die-hard imperialist warmongers, they expose the tragic end of digging their own graves; for the kind people around the world who love peace, they are a powerful guarantee, encouraging them to fight for world peace and human progress.

    History is merciless. Capitalism is bound to die, and socialism is bound to rise. Taking the rapid progress of the Soviet Union as a symbol, combined with various facts in all aspects, whether it is political unity, scientific progress, economic and cultural prosperity, or the victory of military anti-aggression wars, all show the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system. Now, the balance of power between the socialist camp and the imperialist camp has undergone a fundamental change. As Chairman Mao said: "Now it is not the West wind prevailing over the East wind, but the East wind prevailing over the West wind."

    Under the guidance of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, in early 1956, China's national industrialists and businessmen beat gongs and drums to welcome joint state-private ownership. They took an important step on the road to accepting socialist transformation. However, most industrialists and businessmen have not yet fundamentally abandoned their capitalist stance and must undergo further ideological transformation in this comprehensive rectification movement.

    The two great declarations have further encouraged the confidence of China's national industrialists and businessmen in taking the socialist road.

    In addition to responding to the call of the two great declarations with practical actions and striving to defend the cause of peace, our national industrialists and businessmen must also strengthen their study and practice under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, thoroughly transform their political stance through self-awareness, and constantly create conditions for the transformation from exploiters to laborers. Only in this way can we resolutely embark on the road of socialism.

    Ma Xulun, Chairman of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, said that these two great declarations are historical documents. The declaration used the Marxist-Leninist method to profoundly analyze the current international situation and pointed out the changes in the balance of political forces on the world stage. The strength of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union has definitely surpassed the strength of the imperialist camp headed by the United States. The declaration's proposal to defend peace and oppose war is a fatal blow to imperialism and reflects the common aspirations of people all over the world.

    These two declarations also mark the beginning of a new stage in the international unity of the international communist movement. Socialists all over the world will draw strength from the declaration, unite closely with full confidence, and advance along the path of the October Revolution.

    All members of the China Association for Promoting Democracy wholeheartedly endorse these two great revolutionary declarations. We firmly believe that the future belongs to communism, and peace will surely triumph over war. We will draw strength from these two declarations, unswervingly, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, in this nationwide rectification movement, through the struggle between the two roads, through essential transformation, become a political force truly serving socialism, and contribute everything we have to the cause of communism!

    Ji Fang, Central Committee Member of the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party, said that from the two declarations, we clearly realize that the world situation is entering a new turning point. The declaration tells us that a new international unity has emerged in the communist movement, and the unity of the world labor movement, the communist parties and workers' parties of various countries, and socialist countries has been further developed and consolidated. The declaration points out: "Now war can be avoided, and peace can be maintained." This is the greatest gospel for all mankind. The new situation shows that the strength of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union has definitely surpassed the strength of the imperialist camp headed by the United States, which makes people unable to suppress their inner cheers.

    Rightist boss Zhang Bojun once arrogantly clamored that "the world is going to change"! "China is also going to change"! Yes! The two declarations tell us: "The world situation has changed, and the balance of power has changed." The only difference is that what has changed is not what a small group of rightists like Zhang Bojun dreamed of: changing back to the era when capitalism dominated the world; but rather, the East wind has prevailed over the West wind, and socialism has triumphed over capitalism. The two declarations powerfully illustrate the shameful failure of Zhang Bojun and his ilk.

    The members of our Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party must study these two declarations well. These two declarations also have great guiding significance for our ongoing rectification movement and anti-rightist struggle. They will enable us to be more determined and confident in taking the socialist road in the current great debate on whether to take the socialist road or the capitalist road. We are as confident as the people of the whole country and the people of the world that the future of the world will inevitably belong to socialism and communism!

    Chen Qiyou, Chairman of the China Zhi Gong Party, said that these two declarations express the wishes of all good people in the world. I completely agree with and endorse them with great excitement and am willing to support them with practical actions. These two declarations clearly declare the superiority of socialism to the people of the world. Good people in the world will choose the socialist road without hesitation; capitalism will inevitably become a historical relic. These two declarations will encourage the people of the world to move towards new upsurges in defending peace, striving for democracy, and adhering to the socialist movement.

    Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, our Chinese people are advancing on the road of socialist construction with heroic steps. All imperialists and rightists who undermine the unity of the socialist camp centered on the Soviet Union and hinder the progress of our socialist cause will inevitably be thoroughly resisted and abandoned by the Chinese people who have chosen the socialist road. The socialist road is the inevitable result of the development of historical laws and is bound to win. In the current hot revolutionary struggle against the rightists in our country, we must resolutely and bravely accept socialist transformation, break the capitalist stance in politics and ideology, establish the socialist stance, and contribute our strength to our socialist cause.

    Xu Deheng, Chairman of the Jiusan Society, said that the proletariat of the whole world and all peace-loving countries and people will gain infinite confidence, courage, and strength from these two representative conferences and the declarations they adopted.

    These two representative conferences mark a new stage in the unity of communist parties, workers' parties, and socialist countries based on Marxist-Leninist ideology and the principle of proletarian internationalism. This rock-solid unity is a guarantee for world peace, democracy, and the victory of socialism. Our Jiusan Society resolutely supports and warmly responds to these two great revolutionary declarations, wholeheartedly unites around the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, intensifies essential transformation, contributes all its strength to building socialism, and will always be loyal to the banner of socialist internationalism, wholeheartedly safeguards the consolidation and unity of the socialist camp centered on the Soviet Union, and carries out a firm and unremitting struggle for the victory and development of the cause of opposing war, defending peace, and promoting human progress.

    决心在共产党领导下进行改造  为共产主义事业贡献一切力量
    中国各民主党派负责人发表谈话拥护两项伟大革命宣言
    新华社26日讯　据“光明日报”报道：中国各民主党派中央负责人25日向“光明日报”记者发表谈话，热烈拥护“社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议宣言”及共产党和工人党代表会议的“和平宣言”。他们深为这两个伟大的宣言所鼓舞，坚信未来是属于共产主义的，和平一定能战胜战争。他们决心要在中国共产党的领导下，对个人和组织进行根本的改造，为伟大的共产主义事业贡献一切力量。
    中国国民党革命委员会主席李济深说，这两个宣言体现了以苏联为中心的和平、民主、社会主义阵营的伟大国际团结，显示了社会主义国家保卫和平力量的无比强大，表达了全世界进步人类和一切爱好和平的人士的共同心声；而对于以美帝国主义为首的侵略集团，却是一个强有力的警告，如果它们无视这个警告的严重意义继续执行它们的反动政策，那就是灯蛾扑火，自取灭亡。
    这两个宣言更加照亮了我们前进的道路，更加提高了我们未来属于社会主义、和平一定战胜战争的信心。我们决心永远跟着中国共产党走，把这两个宣言所揭示的目标作为我们行动的指针和方向，在争取和平、进步、社会主义的伟大事业中贡献自己的一切力量。我们当前最迫切的任务就是在党内加深和加速反右派的斗争，以取得反右派斗争全面彻底的胜利，只有这样，我们才能转变成为一支真正为社会主义服务的政治力量，才能肩负起这个伟大时代所赋予我们的极其光荣的任务。
    中国民主同盟主席沈钧儒认为，这两项宣言是具有伟大革命意义的历史性文件。它标志着以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结一致的伟大生命力，标志着共产主义运动的国际团结的新阶段，标志着和平和战争之间、社会主义和帝国主义之间的力量对比的变化，和平力量和社会主义力量的显著的优势。他说，全世界劳动人民和所有爱好和平的人民都可以从这两个革命文件中获得无限的信心和勇气。中国人民一定要在伟大的中国共产党的领导下对于建设社会主义事业、对于巩固以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结合作，对于反对帝国主义和维护和平的斗争，作出新的更多的贡献。
    中国民主建国会主委黄炎培说，这两个伟大的宣言，是社会主义阵营的共同纲领；是全世界反对战争，争取和平人民的行动指南；对于顽抗到底的帝国主义好战分子，揭穿了他们自掘坟墓的悲惨结局；对于全世界爱好和平的善良人民，是一个有力的保障，鼓舞了他们为世界和平和人类进步而奋斗。
    历史是无情的。资本主义必然死亡，社会主义必然兴起。以苏联的突飞猛进为标志，结合各方面表现的种种事实，无论是政治的统一、科学的进步、经济和文化的繁荣，以及军事上反侵略战争的胜利，在在显示出社会主义制度的无比优越性。现在，社会主义阵营和帝国主义阵营力量的对比，已经起了根本性的变化，正如毛主席所说的：“现在不是西风压倒东风，而是东风压倒西风。”
    中国民族工商业者，在中国共产党和毛主席的教导下，1956年初，敲锣打鼓，迎接公私合营，他们在接受社会主义改造的道路上跨进了重要的一步。但是，大多数工商业者基本上还没有抛弃资本主义立场，必须在这次全面整风运动中得到更进一步的思想改造。
    两个伟大的宣言，更加鼓舞了中国民族工商业者走社会主义道路的信心。
    我们民族工商业者，除了要以实际行动，响应两个伟大宣言的号召，努力保卫和平事业外；还要在中国共产党的领导下，加强学习和锻炼，通过自觉，彻底改造政治立场，为由剥削者向劳动者的转化不断创造条件，唯有这样，我们才能坚决地走上社会主义的道路。
    中国民主促进会主席马叙伦说，这两个伟大宣言是历史性的文献，宣言以马克思列宁主义方法，精辟地分析了目前的国际局势，指出了世界舞台政治力量对比的变化。以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的力量，已经肯定地超过了以美国为首的帝国主义阵营的力量。宣言提出的保卫和平、反对战争的主张，是对帝国主义的致命打击，反映了全世界人民的共同愿望。
    这两个宣言也标志着国际共产主义运动的国际团结的新阶段的开始。全世界社会主义者将从宣言中汲取力量，满怀信心地紧密地团结在一起，沿着十月革命的大道前进。
    中国民主促进会全体成员衷心拥护这两个伟大的革命宣言。我们深信：未来属于共产主义，和平一定战胜战争。我们将从这两个宣言中获取力量，坚定不移地在中国共产党领导下，在这次全民整风运动中，通过两条道路的斗争，通过本质改造，变为真正为社会主义服务的政治力量，为共产主义事业而贡献我们的一切！
    中国农工民主党中央委员季方说，我们从两个宣言中明确地认识到世界形势正在进入一个新的转折点。宣言告诉我们共产主义运动出现了新的国际团结，世界工人运动、各国共产党和工人党、社会主义国家的团结是更为发展巩固了；宣言指出：“现在战争可以避免，和平可以维护住。”这些对全人类来说是一个最大的福音。新的形势说明了以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的力量，已确定地超过了以美国为首的帝国主义阵营的力量，这些都令人压抑不住内心的欢呼。
    右派头子章伯钧曾狂妄地叫嚣“世界要变”！“中国也要变”！是的！两个宣言告诉我们：“世界的情况改变了，力量的对比改变了。”不同的只是所变的，并非如章伯钧等一小撮右派分子所梦想的那样：变回到资本主义独霸全球的时代里去；而是东风压倒了西风，社会主义战胜了资本主义。两个宣言有力地说明了章伯钧之流可耻的失败。
    我们农工民主党的成员一定要很好地学习这两个宣言。这两个宣言对我们正在进行的整风运动和反右派斗争也有着重大的指导意义，它将使我们在目前进行的走社会主义道路还是走资本主义道路的大辩论中，更加坚定了走社会主义道路的决心和信心。我们和全国人民、全世界人民一样确信：世界的未来必然属于社会主义和共产主义！
    中国致公党主席陈其尤说，这两个宣言表达全世界善良人民的愿望。我以十分兴奋的心情，完全同意它、拥护它，并愿以实际行动支持它。这两个宣言向全世界人民明白宣告了社会主义的优越性。世界善良的人们，将毫不犹疑地选择社会主义道路；资本主义必将成为历史陈迹。这两个宣言，将鼓舞着全世界人民在保卫和平、争取民主和坚持社会主义运动等方面走向新的高涨。
    我们中国人民，在中国共产党的领导下，正以豪迈的步调在社会主义建设大道上前进。一切破坏以苏联为中心的社会主义阵营的团结和阻碍我国社会主义事业前进的帝国主义和右派分子，必然为选择了社会主义道路的中国人民所彻底反击和唾弃。社会主义道路是历史规律发展的必然结果，是一定要胜利的。在目前我国热火朝天的反对右派的革命斗争里，我们一定要坚决地勇敢地接受社会主义改造，在政治上和思想上破资本主义立场，立社会主义立场，为我们的社会主义事业贡献力量。
    九三学社主席许德珩说，全世界无产阶级和一切爱好和平的国家和人民，将从这两个代表会议和它们通过的宣言中，获得无限的信心、勇气和力量。
    这两个代表会议，标志着以马克思列宁主义思想和无产阶级国际主义原则为基础的共产党、工人党和社会主义国家团结的新阶段。这种坚如磐石的团结，是世界和平、民主和社会主义胜利的保证。我们九三学社坚决拥护和热烈响应这两个伟大的革命宣言，一心一意地团结在中国共产党和毛主席的周围，加紧进行本质的改造，为建设社会主义贡献所有的力量；永远忠实于社会主义国际主义的旗帜，全心维护以苏联为中心的社会主义阵营的巩固团结，为反对战争、保卫和平、促进人类进步事业的胜利发展进行坚决不懈的斗争。
