Xinhua News Agency, November 13th, New York Dispatch: The United Nations General Assembly Political Committee began discussing the Korean question on the 12th. The U.S. delegation proposed a motion at the meeting advocating inviting a South Korean representative to participate in the discussion. Indian representative, Mr. Lall, proposed an amendment to this motion, suggesting inviting representatives from both parts of Korea to participate. Mr. Lall emphasized in explaining his amendment that without the participation of representatives from both sides of Korea, the United Nations could not objectively discuss the issue of Korean reunification.

Representatives from Poland, the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Ceylon, Albania, Romania, and Syria spoke in support of the Indian amendment.

Soviet representative Sobolev mentioned a letter from the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Nam Il, to the UN Secretary-General, which stated that the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea firmly insisted on inviting its representative to participate in the discussion of the Korean question. Sobolev emphasized that the people most concerned with the resolution of the Korean question are the Koreans themselves. Without the participation of representatives from both sides of Korea, this issue cannot be resolved fairly and reasonably.

Representatives from Chiang Kai-shek's faction, the United States, Britain, Australia, and several other countries spoke against the Indian amendment.

The Indian amendment was then put to a vote. The amendment was defeated due to the opposition of the thirty-six countries' delegations following the United States. Twenty countries voted in favor of the amendment. Subsequently, the U.S.-drafted resolution to invite a South Korean representative to attend the discussion of the Korean question was passed by a vote of forty-four in favor, fifteen against, and sixteen abstentions.

The committee then began discussing the so-called "substantive" issues.

U.S. representative, Mr. Judd, spoke first, repeating clichés about the situation in Korea, attempting to whitewash the U.S.'s criminal history of aggression against the Korean people, and concealing the U.S.'s current attempt to turn South Korea into a military base for U.S. imperialism in the Far East.

Soviet representative Sobolev spoke again, accusing the United States of intensifying the arming of the South Korean Syngman Rhee puppet government's army and obstructing the peaceful resolution of the Korean question. He also cited various facts to condemn the atrocities of the U.S. military in South Korea.

The committee's next meeting will be held on the 13th.

    联大政委会开始讨论朝鲜问题
    苏联代表指责美国阻挠朝鲜统一
    美国操纵会议通过决议单让南朝鲜参加讨论
    据新华社13日讯　纽约消息：联合国大会政治委员会12日开始讨论朝鲜问题。美国代表团在会上提出一项提案，主张邀请南朝鲜代表参加讨论。印度代表拉尔对这个提案提出一项修正案，建议邀请朝鲜两个部分的代表参加。拉尔在解释他的修正案时强调指出，没有朝鲜双方代表参加，联合国就不可能客观地讨论朝鲜统一问题。
    波兰、苏联、捷克斯洛伐克、锡兰、阿尔巴尼亚、罗马尼亚和叙利亚等国代表纷纷发言支持印度的修正案。
    苏联代表索波列夫在发言中提到朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务相南日给联合国秘书长的一封信，这封信说，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府坚决主张邀请它的代表参加朝鲜问题的讨论。索波列夫强调说，最关心朝鲜问题的解决的，是朝鲜人自己。如果没有朝鲜双方代表参加，这个问题就不可能得到公平合理的解决。
   发言反对印度修正案的有蒋介石分子、美国、英国、澳大利亚和其他一些国家的代表。
    接着印度修正案提付表决。由于追随美国的三十六个国家的代表团投反对票，这个修正案遭到否决。投票赞成修正案的有二十个国家。随后以四十四票赞成、十五票反对和十六票弃权通过了美国拟定的邀请南朝鲜代表出席讨论朝鲜问题的决议。
    委员会接着开始讨论所谓“实质”问题。
    美国代表周以德首先发言，他重弹了有关朝鲜状况的陈词滥调，竭力粉饰美国侵略朝鲜人民的罪恶历史，掩饰美国目前力求把南朝鲜变成美国帝国主义在远东的军事基地的企图。
    苏联代表索波列夫再次发言，指责美国加紧武装南朝鲜李承晚傀儡政府的军队、阻挠朝鲜问题的和平解决。他并且列举种种事实，谴责美国军队在南朝鲜的暴行。
    委员会下次会议在13日举行。
