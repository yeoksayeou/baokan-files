Haze Over the Taiwan Strait
	By a People's Daily Commentator

	The thick fog over the English Channel delayed Macmillan's flight to Paris for two hours on his way to meet with Gaillard. However, the haze in the relationship between the two partners on either side of the Channel delayed Macmillan's return to London by a whole day.

	Although the time for this meeting between the British Prime Minister and the French Prime Minister was twice as long as originally scheduled, the communique issued after the meeting showed that the dispute currently existing between the two countries, which even Macmillan openly admitted was "too serious," has not been resolved.

	The North African issue was the main agenda of this meeting. The recent dispute between the United States and Britain with France over the arms supply incident in Tunisia reflects the gradual intensification of the infighting within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. France's old partner in the Suez War has now ganged up with the United States, which they fought against last time, to give France a cold shoulder, to which Paris's reaction is particularly fierce. However, Downing Street has its own calculations. After losing a lot of territory in the Middle East, taking advantage of France's plight to open the door to North Africa from Tunisia is not necessarily losing in the east and gaining in the west. Moreover, cooperating with the United States can greatly enhance its status and have the advantage of playing both sides. Therefore, the old friendship of old partners is no longer taken into account.

	However, the cunning old British imperialism does not want to kick France away completely. The "Anglo-French alliance" is still useful for it to deal with Washington and cope with the powerful opponent of West Germany. Therefore, after giving France a cold shoulder, Macmillan rushed to Paris to carry out appeasement work. The communique issued at the end of the meeting specially emphasized the "unity" between Britain and France, and also stated that "France should continue to fulfill its special responsibilities in North Africa," acknowledging that France has the "responsibility to solve the Algerian problem" and "traditionally occupies a leading position" in North Africa.

	Despite the empty sweet words written in the communique for French public opinion, no agreement was reached on the main issue of the Tunisian arms supply at the meeting. The meeting communique announced that the two countries "decided to make arrangements aimed at avoiding the recurrence of difficulties similar to those that have recently occurred." This sentence is very intriguing. Since it is only to make arrangements, it means that arrangements have not yet been made; since it is only to avoid recurrence, it confirms the established facts that have already occurred. Moreover, the so-called "avoiding recurrence" is just an excuse. On the same day that the communique was issued, a British spokesman immediately stated that these words in the communique did not mean that Britain agreed to no longer transport weapons to Tunisia.

	Of course, as far as Britain is concerned, these nice words in the communique cannot be said for nothing. Appeasement is for utilization. In this regard, at least two important points can be seen from the meeting communique. The first is about the upcoming NATO summit, which is scheduled to discuss the overall adjustment of internal relations and strategic deployment within the alliance. France has reacted strongly to the US and Britain's unilateral formulation of a plan that arranges a subordinate position for other members of the alliance. Britain is pleased that Washington has finally accepted the "US-British cooperation," and on the other hand, it wants to take advantage of the recent increase in dissatisfaction with the United States among Western European countries, especially France. The meeting communique specifically mentioned the words "should be in accordance with the spirit of equality" and "develop the alliance consultation system." These words seem to contradict the basic spirit of the plan prepared by the United States and Britain for the NATO alliance, but it is obviously very suitable for those "allied countries" who are complaining about this plan. People can vaguely see the traces of Britain's traditional so-called "balance of power" two-sided diplomacy.

	The second is about the "free trade area" issue. Since the establishment of the European Six Common Market, Britain has always had a headache: resisting it would put itself at risk of being completely squeezed out of the Western European continent by West Germany, and participating in it would damage the special interests of the British Empire's colonial system. Britain's wishful thinking is to use a "free trade area" to trap the "common market," so that it neither participates in it and bears the constraints, nor stands outside and does nothing. However, one of the main obstacles encountered by this "free trade area" plan is France's insistence that "free trade" should include agricultural products; and this is unacceptable to Britain, which has benefited greatly from the trade of agricultural products from the Commonwealth region due to the imperial preference system. This Anglo-French meeting communique specifically emphasized the importance of "finding solutions to the technical problems involved" in the "free trade area." It seems that the two sides had a bargaining session on this issue that has not yet been completed.

	The meeting between Macmillan and Gaillard ended in an atmosphere of wishing each other prosperity. For the Gaillard government, it can play a role in overcoming the danger of the current cabinet's collapse on the Algerian issue, but if it is said to enhance France's position, it only leaves a beautiful illusion. People recall that this spring, when the British Queen visited France, government officials of the two countries frequently toasted the "eternal friendship" and "close cooperation" between Britain and France. Today's facts are a strong irony of this "eternal friendship" and "close cooperation."

    海峡两岸的阴霾	本报评论员
    英吉利海峡上的浓雾，使得麦克米伦在为了和盖伊阿会谈而飞往巴黎的旅途中耽搁了两个小时。而海峡两边的两个伙伴相互关系中的阴霾，却使麦克米伦返回伦敦的日期推迟了整整一天。
    虽然英国首相和法国总理这次会谈的时间比原来的日程延长了一倍，但是，会谈结束后所发表的公报表明，目前存在于两国之间的、连麦克米伦也公开承认是“太严重”的争端，并没有得到解决。
    北非问题，是这次会谈的主要议程。最近在突尼斯军火供应事件中美英同法国之间的争吵，反映了北大西洋公约集团内部钩心斗角的斗争正在逐步尖锐化。法国在苏伊士战争中的老伙伴，这次却伙同它们上次曾一起对之进行斗争的美国，给法国一冷枪，对这一点，巴黎的反应是特别激烈的。但是，唐宁街有自己的算盘。在中东失去不少地盘之后，乘法国之危从突尼斯打开进入北非的大门，未始不是失之东隅，收之桑榆，又是同美国合伙，大可抬高身价，实有左右逢源之利。因此，老伙伴的旧情也就顾不得了。
    不过，老奸巨滑的英帝国主义也并不想把法国一脚踢开，“英法联盟”对于它同华盛顿打交道以及应付西德这个强大对手还有用处。因此，在戳了法国一冷枪之后，麦克米伦又赶到巴黎进行安抚工作。会谈结束时发表的公报就特地渲染了一番英法的“团结一致”，还表示“法国应该继续履行它在北非的特别责任”，承认法国负有“解决阿尔及利亚问题的责任”，并在北非“传统上占有领导地位”。
    尽管公报里写上了这一些针对法国舆论的空洞的甜言蜜语，会谈在突尼斯军火供应这个主要问题上却没有协议。会谈公报宣布两国“决定作出目的在于避免同最近发生的困难相类似的困难重新发生的安排”。这句话是很耐人寻味的。既然只是要作出安排，就是还没有能够安排；既然只是要避免重新发生，就是肯定了已经发生的既成事实。何况所谓“避免重新发生”也不过是一句遁辞。就在公报发表的当天，英国的一个发言人马上声明，公报上的这些话并不意味着英国同意不再运武器给突尼斯。
    当然，在英国说来，公报中这些动听言辞也不能是白讲的，抚慰是为了利用。关于这一方面，从会谈公报中至少可以看出两个重要之点，第一是关于即将举行的北大西洋公约首脑会议，这次会议预定将讨论全面调整公约集团内部关系和战略部署的问题。法国对于美英片面拟订了一个为其他公约成员国安排了从属地位的计划，已有强烈反应。英国一方面庆幸自己终究又使得华盛顿接受“美英提携”，另一方面又想利用西欧国家首先是法国最近增涨的对美国的不满。会谈公报中特地提到了“应该依照平等精神”、“发展联盟协商制度”的字样。这些话看来同美英联合给北大西洋公约集团准备的计划的基本精神是矛盾的，但是它显然极投合正在对这个计划议论纷纷的那些心怀不平的“盟国”。人们从这中间可以隐约看到英国传统的所谓“势力均衡”的两面外交的痕迹。
    第二是关于“自由贸易区”问题。自从欧洲六国共同市场成立以后，英国一直有一个伤脑筋的问题，就是：抵制吧自己有被西德完全排挤出西欧大陆的危险，参加吧又有损于英帝国的殖民体系的特殊利益。英国的如意算盘是用一个“自由贸易区”来套住“共同市场”，这样既不参加进去承受束缚，又不站在外边无可作为。但是这个“自由贸易区”计划所遇到的主要障碍之一，就是法国坚持的“自由贸易”应当包括农产品的态度；而这一点，对于因帝国特惠制度而从英联邦地区的农产品买卖中大获其利的英国来说，却是不可接受的。这一次英法会谈公报中特地强调为“自由贸易区”“所牵涉的技术问题找出解决办法”的重要性。看来双方在这个问题上进行了一场还未曾完的讨价还价。
    麦克米伦和盖伊阿的会谈在恭喜发财的气氛中结束了。这次会谈对于盖伊阿政府来说，要渡过目前尚未过去的内阁在阿尔及利亚问题上倒台的危险，可以起一些作用，若说提高法国的地位，则留下的只是一个美妙的幻望。人们回忆起今年春季，当英国女王访法的时候，两国的政府官员频频为英法的“永恒友谊”和“紧密合作”干杯。今天的事实，恰好是对这种“永恒友谊”和“紧密合作”的一个强烈的讽刺。
