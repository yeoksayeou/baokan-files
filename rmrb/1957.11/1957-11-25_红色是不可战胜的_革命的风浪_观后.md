    "Red is Invincible"
    —After Watching "The Storm of Revolution"
    Méi Qiān
    Near the end of the fourth act of "The Storm of Revolution," a particularly exciting scene appears on stage: Outside the window of the home of Professor Polyezhayev, a seventy-five-year-old plant physiology expert, gather the Red Guards and revolutionary sailors who have come to bid him farewell before their departure. The window is filled with resounding songs and cheers, and the frail old professor, supporting his weak body, rushes to the window. He speaks to the soldiers with burning passion, saying, "Red soldiers! You must know that red is invincible. It is not only the color of blood, but also the color of creation. It is the only color of new life in nature, filling the tender shoots of plants with life and warming everything..."
    These words are powerful coming from an old intellectual! The old professor's praise of red lies not in its scientific meaning, but more importantly in its political significance. Just imagine: a plant physiology expert being chosen by the Baltic Fleet soldiers as a representative to participate in the revolutionary regime—is this some legendary coincidence? No, it is because he correctly solved the question of who science serves, and the question of the relationship between a scientific expert and the Party. It is precisely because he was imbued with "red," and supported the red regime, that he himself, in his declining years, was filled with life like the tender shoots of plants, and gained warmth. Through Polyezhayev's life path, the author points out a broad prospect for us and provides a good example, a valuable reference, for the current great debate on being both red and expert.
    "The Storm of Revolution" is a thought-provoking play, and viewers must calm down and carefully appreciate and understand it. It does not contain large scenes of turbulent waves, nor can one find tortuous and bizarre plots. In a simple and realistic life, the author's pen penetrates into the depths of the characters' hearts, giving us a sense of intimacy. The play provides three distinct images of intellectuals who, under the impact of the revolutionary wave, chose different paths. Through the profound changes in their thoughts and feelings, it also reflects the magnificent revolutionary era and summarizes the faces of intellectuals of that era.
    Polyezhayev is a man who has "been observing a green leaf in a glass tube for nearly forty years," studying how it absorbs and stores sunlight. He buries himself in his work diligently. But in the storm of revolution, the door of his study could no longer be closed. The tranquility of the room is constantly broken by the sound of gunfire on the street, his beloved assistant is hunted down by the Tsar, his residence is searched by revolutionary soldiers... (By the way, the author arranges a clever detailed description in these places; the several uses of the key to the professor's residence have profound meaning.) Due to his integrity and pursuit of truth, he steadfastly leaned towards the revolutionary regime. He wrote political prefaces in his scientific works; published articles in Bolshevik newspapers; and braved the cold to lecture the sailors. Although this simple old man cannot consciously understand the influence and significance of his actions, he has done good things for the revolution. But this path is not entirely smooth. In the third act, he suffers a series of blows. Reactionary newspapers curse him as a Bolshevik "running dog," a "sell-out," wanting to "mourn" for him. He is snubbed by relatives and friends on his seventy-fifth birthday, and no one comes to congratulate him. Students go on strike, teaching assistants threaten him, and even scatter the manuscript of his carefully written work all over the floor. All of this, in the deep scene where he and his old wife silently face each other next to the piano, makes the character feel his own aging, loneliness, and desolation, and makes us shed tears of sympathy amidst indignation. But he does not show the slightest frustration or wavering. He has experienced a severe test, which also demonstrates a person's true "integrity." Finally, under the care of the Party and the instructions of Lenin, he gains warmth and support. This is truly an eventful old age.
    His two assistants are completely opposite images. Vorobyov feels that "the rules of personal life have been completely disrupted" in the storm of revolution, and believes that the revolution is a "shameful struggle for power," "barbaric"! He says, "I need nothing but science." But in reality, he takes a hostile attitude towards the revolutionary regime, using science as a tool for fame and fortune. This despicable soul is finally spurned by the times. Baocharov, on the other hand, is an expert who is red to the core, truly sharing the joys and sorrows of the revolution. When the enemy counterattacks, he bravely takes up his gun and goes to the front line. This is a brilliant example for our intellectuals today.
    Yes, as the old professor said, red is invincible. This is a serious topic in our lives. Through the performance of this play, we can gain beneficial insights.

    “红色是不可战胜的”
    ——“革命的风浪”观后
    梅阡
    在“革命的风浪”的第四幕将近结尾的时候，舞台上出现了一个异常激动人心的场面：七十五岁的老教授、植物生理学专家波列查耶夫住宅的窗户外面，集聚着出发前向他来告别的赤卫队和革命水兵们，响彻云霄的歌声与欢呼声冲开了窗口，老教授撑持着孱弱的病躯，奔赴窗前。他以一种燃烧着的激情向士兵们讲话，他说：“红色的战士们！要知道，红色是不可战胜的。这不仅是血的颜色，这也是创造的颜色。这是大自然中唯一新生的颜色，它使植物的嫩芽充满生命，温暖着一切……”
    这些话，在一个旧知识分子说来是响亮的语言！老教授对红色的颂赞并不在于它的科学意义，而重要的是它的政治意义。试想：一个植物生理学专家被波罗底海舰队的士兵选为参加革命政权的代表，难道这是什么传奇性的偶合吗？不是的，这是由于他正确地解决了科学为什么人服务的问题，解决了一个科学专家与党的关系的问题。正因他浸染了“红色”，支持了红色政权，才使他自己在垂暮的晚年象植物的嫩芽一样充满了生命，获得了温暖。透过波列查耶夫的生活道路，作者给我们指出了一条广阔的前途，对我们今天所展开的又红又专的大辩论，提供了一个良好的范例，一个可贵的借鉴。
    “革命的风浪”是一出耐人寻思的戏，观者必须沉静下来细心的欣赏和领会。它里边没有惊涛骇浪的大场面，也找不到曲折离奇的情节，在一片朴素真实的生活中，作者的笔渗透到人物内心的深处，使我们有着倍觉亲切之感。戏中提供了三个鲜明的知识分子的形象，在革命浪潮的冲击下，他们选择了不同的道路，通过他们思想感情的深刻的变化，从而也反映那个波澜壮阔的革命的大时代，概括了那个时代的知识分子的面貌。
    波列查耶夫是个“将近四十年来一直观察着一张装在玻璃管里的绿叶子”的人，研究它怎样吸收阳光和储藏阳光的。他埋首案头孜孜不倦。但在革命的风浪中他书斋的大门再也关闭不住了。室内的静谧时时为街上的枪声所打破，心爱的助手为沙皇所追捕，住宅受到革命士兵的搜查……（顺便提一下，作者在这些地方都安排了一个巧妙的细节的描写，教授住宅那把钥锁几次的运用，是有其深隽的意味的。）由于他的正直和追求真理，他坚持不渝的倾向于革命政权。他在科学的著作中写了带政治性的序言；在布尔什维克的报纸上发表文章；冒着风寒为水兵们去讲课。这个质朴的老人虽不能自觉其行动的影响与意义，但他为革命作了好事。而这条道路也不是十分平坦的。在第三幕里他遭到一系列的打击，反动的报纸咒骂他是布尔什维克的“走狗”，“卖身投靠”，要为他“哀悼”，在他庆贺七十五岁的生日时受到亲友的冷遇，没一个人来祝贺，学生的罢课，助教的要挟，甚至把他精心著作的原稿掷散满地。这一切，使他在钢琴旁边与老妻默默相对的那个深沉的场面里，人物的内心也感到自己的衰老，孤独和凄凉，使我们在愤慨中为之一掬同情之泪，但他却没有表示丝毫的沮丧与动摇。他经历了严重的考验，这也正表现了一个人真正的“傲骨”。终于在党的关怀和列宁的指示下，他获得了温暖与支持。这真是一个不平静的晚年。
    他的两个助手是个完全相反的形象。沃罗别约夫在革命的风浪中感到“个人的生活规律完全被破坏了”，觉得革命是“为了政权可耻的争夺”，“野蛮”！他说：“我除了科学之外什么都不需要。”但实际他对革命政权采取了仇视的态度，把科学作为名利的工具，这个卑鄙的灵魂终于为时代所唾弃。而包恰罗夫则是个红透了的专家，与革命真正的同呼吸共存亡，当敌人反扑的时候，他又勇敢地拿起枪而走上前线。这是我们今天知识分子的一个光辉的榜样。
    是的，正如老教授所说，红色是不可战胜的，这是我们生活中一个严肃的课题。通过这个戏的演出，我们可以从中得到有益的启示。
