Xinhua News Agency, November 17th – Most of the revealed results of the Philippine general election show that the current president, Nacionalista Party candidate Garcia, will be re-elected as president, and Liberal Party candidate Macapagal will be elected as vice president. It will be the first time in Philippine history that the president and vice president belong to different political parties.

Garcia told reporters from the American United Press International on November 15th that he would continue to "maintain the closest friendly relations with the United States" and "strengthen ties with Asian neighbors." He said that he certainly welcomed American financial "aid." Garcia also said that he intends to request the resumption of negotiations on the issue of American military bases in the Philippines as soon as possible. Garcia believes that "it would be appropriate for him to take a trip to the United States."

According to news from Washington, American officials are pleased that Garcia and Macapagal will be elected as the president and vice president of the Philippines.

    美国官员洋洋得意
    据新华社17日讯　大部分已经揭晓的菲律宾大选投票的结果显示，现任总统、国民党候选人加西亚将连任总统，自由党候选人麦卡帕格将当选副总统。菲律宾历史上将第一次出现总统和副总统分属于不同政党的局面。
    加西亚在11月15日接见美国合众社记者时表示，他将继续“同美国保持最亲密的友好关系”，并且要“加强同亚洲邻国的联系”。他说，他当然欢迎美国的财政“援助”。加西亚又说，他打算尽速要求恢复关于美国在菲律宾的军事基地问题的谈判。加西亚认为，他“到美国走一趟是相宜的”。
    据华盛顿传来的消息说，美国官员对加西亚和麦卡帕格将当选菲律宾的总统和副总统，表示高兴。
