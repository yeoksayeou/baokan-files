    Strengthening the Self-Reform of Marxist-Leninist Teachers
    Lecturer of the Marxist-Leninist Teaching and Research Office of Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology Huang Dasan
    "Constantly reforming oneself" is something everyone needs. However, as Marxist-Leninist teachers in the new society, they have special responsibilities and unique work natures, and therefore need to pay special attention to self-reform.

    To cultivate cadres who serve the socialist revolution and socialist construction, in addition to equipping students with certain professional knowledge, political and ideological education occupies a primary position. Comrade Mao Zedong said, "Without a correct political viewpoint, it is like having no soul." Cadres without a correct political viewpoint can hardly become excellent socialist builders. As "engineers of the human soul," teachers must do a good job of undertaking the task of political and ideological education. Although every professional teacher must bear this responsibility, political teachers must bear even more responsibility. Educators must first educate themselves, so the self-reform of Marxist-Leninist teachers needs to be accelerated. It is unimaginable that teachers who hold a bourgeois worldview and are unwilling to approach the worker-peasant masses can cultivate working-class cadres needed for socialist revolution and socialist construction. If teachers themselves have serious bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideological consciousness, it will inevitably affect students; when analyzing political and ideological issues, it will inevitably lead to some erroneous explanations or conclusions. The current anti-Rightist struggle also provides living proof that schools with more Rightist elements among the teachers have particularly chaotic student thinking.

    In addition, from the perspective of Marxist-Leninist teachers improving their professional level, self-reform is particularly important. In our past Marxist-Leninist teaching, there were some problems: teachers' own theoretical level improved slowly, many issues were not explained thoroughly in lectures, the integration of theory and practice was very rigid, and lectures were empty and boring. There are many reasons for these problems, but the failure to do a good job in teachers' own transformation is closely related to the emergence of these situations.

    Speaking of the slow improvement of teachers' own theoretical level, this is directly related to our "only willing to study Marxism-Leninism in the study, unwilling to approach the worker-peasant masses, and not having close ties with the worker-peasant masses." Marxism-Leninism, as a guide to action, is itself a summary of scientific achievements and class struggle. The purpose of studying it is also to guide practice. How can such a science be mastered by those who only wish to study in the study? How can a "science about the revolution of the oppressed and exploited masses" be thoroughly understood by those who are "unwilling to approach the worker-peasant masses and do not have close ties with the worker-peasant masses"? Looking back at the difficulty of improving our own theoretical level in the past, this is a major reason. For example, the method of class analysis, we also experienced some when reading classical works, but the experience was not deep. After participating in the current struggle against the bourgeois Rightists, our understanding has deepened. Without a certain amount of class struggle experience, it is not easy to deeply understand that a class stance will be expressed in all issues. Therefore, although we also read some classical works in the past, we did not combine it with actual struggle, and we did not have enough practical experience to verify the theory, which made the study of theory fall into emptiness. It is not just reciting some words that gets you only some fragmentary or isolated concepts. The ability to integrate and understand is very low. When encountering new problems, we can only look for explanations from classical works by quoting out of context, that is, we can only adopt a dogmatic hard-line approach, but cannot use the Marxist method to analyze problems relatively skillfully. Under such circumstances, it is naturally not easy to improve one's theoretical level quickly.

    The inability to improve the teacher's own theoretical level will of course affect the teaching level. If the teachers themselves do not have a thorough understanding of many theoretical issues, they will inevitably not be able to thoroughly explain them to the students. Secondly, if the teachers themselves do not have a thorough understanding of the theory and rarely leave the study to approach the worker-peasant masses, then how can they do a good job in integrating theory with practice, since they are ambiguous about both theory and practice? Such teaching cannot be expected to allow students to learn any Marxism.

    Therefore, it can be said that the difficulties that are reflected in daily teaching and exist to varying degrees in the vast majority of teachers are mainly rooted in the fact that the teachers themselves have not carried out self-reform well. If Marxist-Leninist teachers themselves still have serious bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideas, and hold these ideas to study Marxism-Leninism and conduct Marxist-Leninist teaching, that is, do not approach the worker-peasant masses and separate theory from practice, such teachers are difficult to cultivate working-class cadres needed for socialist revolution and socialist construction.

    Studying Marxism requires participating in actual revolutionary work and revolutionary struggles. Communist knowledge that is divorced from theory and practice is worthless.

    Comrade Mao Zedong also instructed in "Reform Our Study": "Not paying attention to studying the current situation, not paying attention to studying history, and not paying attention to the application of Marxism-Leninism are all extremely bad styles." If we do not leave the study, do not approach the worker-peasant masses, and do not participate in actual struggles, how can we understand the current situation and apply Marxism-Leninism? It is impossible to learn Marxism by using methods that violate Marxism; let alone teach others to learn Marxism.

    The goal of self-reform for Marxist-Leninist teachers is to transform their bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideas, as well as the learning methods and teaching methods that arise from these ideas.

    There are many ways to transform, but I believe it is necessary to start by changing the method of studying Marxism-Leninism. Changing the learning method makes it easier to transform one's own thinking. If one is in constant contact with reality, close to the working people, and participates in the actual class struggle, it will be easier to cultivate the thoughts and feelings of the working class, and it will be easier to overcome bourgeois individualism.

    Only by constantly linking with reality and participating in actual struggles can Marxist-Leninist teachers have practical knowledge to verify theory, and the understanding of theory will naturally be easier and more thorough; with the ideological and emotional foundation of the working class, it will be more convenient to accept and understand Marxist-Leninist theory.

    Marxist-Leninist teachers must correct their learning methods, must go to the worker-peasant masses, participate in physical labor, and thoroughly transform their non-proletarian ideas from actual struggles, and establish working-class ideas. If we do this, we believe that some of the shortcomings that existed in past teaching will definitely be gradually overcome; and our correct learning methods and working-class thoughts and feelings will also affect students and infect students.

    加强马列主义教师的自我改造	北京钢铁工业学院马列主义教研室讲师　黄达三
    “不断地改造自己”，这是每个人都需要的。不过，作为新社会的马列主义教师，他们有着特别的责任和特殊的工作性质，因之就需要特别重视自我改造。
    培养为社会主义革命和社会主义建设服务的干部，除了要使学生具有一定的专业知识以外，政治思想教育占有首要的地位。毛泽东同志说：“没有正确的政治观点，就等于没有灵魂”。没有正确的政治观点的干部是很难成为一个优秀的社会主义建设者。作为“人类灵魂的工程师”的教师，我们就必须很好地担负起政治思想教育的工作。这责任虽然每个专业教师都要担负，但是政治教师要担负更多的责任。教育者必先教育自己，所以马列主义教师的自我改造就需要加速进行。不能想像，依靠抱着资产阶级世界观，不愿意接近工农群众的教师，能够培植出社会主义革命和社会主义建设所需要的工人阶级干部来。如果教师本身存在着严重的资产阶级、小资产阶级的思想意识，就必然要影响学生；在分析政治问题、思想问题的时候，就必然要引出一些错误的说明或结论。在这次反右派斗争中也提出了活生生的证明，就是教员中右派分子较多的学校，学生中的思想也特别混乱。
    另外，马列主义教师从提高自己的业务水平说，自我改造也特别重要。在我们过去的马列主义的教学中存在一些这样的问题：教师自己的理论水平提高很慢，讲课时很多问题讲不透彻，理论联系实际很生硬，讲课空洞枯燥。产生这些问题的原因很多，但是教师本身的改造工作没有做好，和这些情况的产生是紧密相关的。
    从教师本身的理论水平提高很慢说，这和我们的“只愿在书房里研究马列主义，不愿意接近工农群众，和工农群众没有密切联系”是直接相关的。作为行动指南的马列主义，它本身是科学成就和阶级斗争的总结。学习它的目的也是要指导实践。这样的科学又怎能被只愿在书房研究的人掌握呢？研究一种“关于被压迫和被剥削群众革命的科学”，又怎能为“不愿意接近工农群众，和工农群众没有密切联系”的人所透彻理解呢？我们回顾自己过去理论水平的不容易提高，这是一项主要原因。例如阶级分析的方法，我们在读经典著作时也体会了一些，然而体会是不深的。经过参加这次反资产阶级右派的斗争，加深了自己的认识。自己没有一定的阶级斗争的经验，就不易深切理解在一切问题上都会表现出阶级立场。所以我们过去虽然也读了一些经典著作，但是没有把它和实际斗争结合起来，没有相当的实践经验去印证理论，这样就使理论的学习落入空洞。不是仅背诵一些词句就是只得到一些片断的或孤立的概念。融会贯通的能力很低。遇到了新问题，就只能从经典著作中去寻章摘句作解释，也就是只能采取一种教条主义的硬套方法，而不能比较纯熟地运用马克思主义的方法去分析问题。在这样的情况下，要想较快地提高自己的理论水平，自然不容易。
    教师本身的理论水平不能提高当然要影响教学水平。教师本身有很多理论问题就没有透彻理解，对学生讲述的时候就必然不能透彻。其次，教师自己对理论没有透彻理解，又很少走出书房，接近工农群众；这样对理论和实践两方面都很模糊，又如何能做好理论联系实际的工作呢？这样的教学也绝不能希望学生能学到一点什么马克思主义。
    所以，可以说，平日在教学中所反映的，绝大多数教员都或多或少的存在的困难问题，它们的主要根源就是教师本身没有很好地进行自我改造。如果马列主义教师本身还存在着严重的资产阶级、小资产阶级思想，并抱着这种思想去学习马列主义和进行马列主义教学，即不接近工农群众，把理论和实践割裂开来，这样的教师是很难培植出社会主义革命和社会主义建设所需要的工人阶级的干部的。
    学习马克思主义，需要参加实际的革命工作和革命斗争，理论和实践脱离的共产主义知识是一文不值的。
    毛泽东同志在“改造我们的学习”中也曾指示过：“不注重研究现状，不注重研究历史，不注重马克思列宁主义的应用，这些都是极坏的作风”。如果我们不出书房，不接近工农群众，不参加实际斗争，又怎能了解现状，应用马列主义呢？用违背马克思主义的办法是不能学习马克思主义的；更不能教导别人学到马克思主义。
    马列主义教师自我改造的目标，就是要改造自己资产阶级、小资产阶级的思想，以及从这种思想产生的学习方法和教学方法。
    改造的办法有许多，我以为还要从改变学习马克思列宁主义的方法做起。改变了学习方法，也就比较容易改造自己的思想。如果经常和现实接触，和劳动人民接近，参加现实的阶级斗争，工人阶级的思想感情就会比较容易养成，资产阶级的个人主义思想也会比较容易克服。
    马列主义教师只有经常联系实际，参加实际斗争，才能有实际知识去印证理论，理论的了解自然容易透彻；有了工人阶级的思想感情基础，对马列主义理论的接受和理解也比较方便。
    马列主义教师必须端正学习方法，必须到工农群众中去，参加体力劳动，从实际斗争中来彻底改造自己的非无产阶级思想，树立工人阶级思想。如果这样做，我们相信过去教学中所存在的一些缺点必定能够逐步克服；并且我们的正确的学习方法和工人阶级的思想感情，也会影响学生，感染学生。
