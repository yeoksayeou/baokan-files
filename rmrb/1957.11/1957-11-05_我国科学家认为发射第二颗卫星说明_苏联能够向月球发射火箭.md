Xinhua News Agency, November 4th -- Chinese scientists Qian Xuesen and Guo Yonghuai believe that the Soviet Union's successful launch of such a heavy artificial satellite demonstrates that the Soviet Union has mastered the conditions for launching four-stage rockets to the moon.

They made these remarks at a symposium convened by the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing on the afternoon of the 4th regarding the Soviet Union's launch of the second artificial satellite. The scientists attending the symposium all estimated that the Soviet Union's great achievements in science and technology must be far greater than what we see now.

Qian Xuesen said that according to the TASS communique, the instruments, experimental animals, and power supply equipment on the satellite alone weighed 508.3 kilograms, which does not include the weight of the final stage rocket structure itself. Therefore, if the launch rocket is a three-stage rocket, its take-off weight must be close to 2,000 times the weight of the experimental equipment it carries, i.e., 1,000 tons, and the thrust of the first stage rocket may be 1,500 tons. According to this estimate, if this three-stage rocket is modified and the 500-plus kilogram experimental equipment is replaced with a fourth-stage rocket, with about 20 kilograms of measurement equipment in the fourth-stage rocket, it would become a four-stage rocket that could send the fourth-stage rocket and measurement equipment to the moon. Guo Yonghuai said that from a technical point of view, there is no problem for the Soviet Union to launch a four-stage rocket to the moon, and it is estimated that the Soviet Union will launch a rocket to the moon in the next stage.

Scientists at the symposium discussed other issues related to this artificial satellite.

Biologist Shi Luji pointed out that the Soviet Union's launch of such a complex artificial satellite shows that science must utilize collective power and also illustrates the necessity of organization in scientific research. He said that the successful launch of this satellite with a dog has opened up new avenues for experimental biology. Biology has lost weight at such a high altitude, and there is no way to experiment with what happens after losing weight on the ground or in the air not far from the ground. Cosmic ray radiation is very strong at high altitudes, and this artificial satellite with a dog can more fully understand the impact of cosmic ray radiation on biological physiology.

Guo Yonghuai said that there are many difficult problems in maintaining life in a biological body at an altitude of 500 kilometers to 1,500 kilometers, such as the loss of weight of the biological body, and especially the strong cosmic ray radiation that can directly threaten life. The Soviet Union's experiment on the physiological conditions of dogs at high altitudes can provide important scientific data for future human travel in outer space.

Physicist Zhang Wenyu said that many sciences related to high altitude, such as geomagnetic measurements and distribution in geophysics, the origin of cosmic rays, and astrophysical phenomena, have relied on observations on the ground or in the air not far from the ground in the past, and may not be the same as the actual situation in high altitude. Only artificial satellites can obtain reliable data. For example, the highly polarized radio waves emitted from the Crab Nebula can be used to infer that the magnetic field of the cosmic ray acceleration mechanism in interstellar space is regular, but this high polarization is observed on the ground. When radio waves pass through the atmosphere, they may be absorbed and emitted, so it may be different from the actual situation in high altitude. Only observations with artificial satellites can reveal the true situation. Zhang Wenyu said that in the history of science, the problems of science itself are often rapidly and greatly developed due to new technologies. The successful launch of these two artificial satellites by the Soviet Union is probably the greatest technological achievement in the history of science, and it can be predicted that all disciplines will make great progress as a result.

Xinhua News Agency, November 4th -- Li Siguang, Vice President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, issued a statement on the 4th regarding the successful launch of the second artificial satellite by the Soviet Union, saying: On October 4th, the Soviet Union launched the first artificial Earth satellite. In just one month, the Soviet Union launched a second artificial Earth satellite that was far more complex and much heavier than the first, and successfully sent an animal with a higher nervous system, under the device that constantly checks its physiological activities, to high altitude. This has opened up a new path in the exploration of outer space. This not only shows that Soviet scientists have taken another big step forward in the scientific cause of mankind's conquest of the universe, but also proves that the Soviet Union has made revolutionary developments in many departments of science and technology.

We Chinese scientific workers feel extremely admiration and excitement for the great achievements of Soviet scientists, engineers, and workers, and also feel very proud with brotherly feelings.

We are even more enthusiastically looking forward to the Soviet Union's artificial lunar satellite and manned satellite that can return to Earth operating in outer space in the near future.

### 我国科学家认为发射第二颗卫星说明  苏联能够向月球发射火箭

    我国科学家认为发射第二颗卫星说明
    苏联能够向月球发射火箭
    新华社4日讯　力学家钱学森和郭永怀认为，苏联这次发射这样重的人造卫星获得成功，说明苏联已经掌握了发射四级火箭到月球去的条件。
    他们是在4日下午中国科学院在北京召集的一次关于苏联发射第二颗人造卫星的座谈会上说的。参加座谈会的科学家都估计苏联科学技术的伟大成就一定远比我们现在所看到的要大。
    钱学森说，照塔斯社公报，光是卫星上的仪器、试验动物和电源设备就有五百零八点三公斤重，这并不包含最后一级火箭本身结构的重量，所以如果发射火箭是一个三级火箭，它的起飞重量一定接近卫星所带实验设备重量的两千倍，即一千吨，而一级火箭的推力可能是一千五百吨。照这样估计，如果把这个三级火箭改装，把五百多公斤重的实验设备换成第四级的火箭，在第四级火箭里带上约二十公斤重的测视设备，这样就成为一个四级火箭，就可以把第四级火箭连测视设备一齐送到月球上去。郭永怀说，从技术上看，苏联发射四级火箭到月球去是没有问题的，估计苏联下一阶段就发射去月球的火箭。
  科学家们在座谈会上谈到了有关这颗人造卫星的其他问题。
    生物学家施履吉指出，从苏联发射这样一颗复杂的人造卫星，可见科学一定要发挥集体力量，也说明了科学研究中组织性的必要。他说，这颗带狗的人造卫星的发射成功，为实验生物学开辟了新的途径。生物在这样的高空已经失去重量，在失去重量后的情况怎样，这在地面上和离地面不远的空中是没有办法实验的。高空中宇宙线辐射很强，这个带狗的人造卫星，可以比较充分地了解宇宙线辐射对生物生理的影响。
    郭永怀说，生物体要在五百公里到一千五百公里高空中维持生活，困难问题很多，如生物体失去了重量，特别是强烈宇宙线辐射可以直接威胁生命。苏联这次在高空中实验狗的生理情况，可以为今后人在宇宙空间旅行提供重要科学数据。
    物理学家张文裕说，现在许多同高空有关的科学，如地球物理方面的地磁测量、分布，宇宙线的起源以及天体物理现象等，过去都是依靠在地面或离地面不远的空中进行观测的，可能和高空中的实际情况不相同，只有用人造卫星才能得到可靠的数据。例如：从蟹状星云发射出的高度极化的无线电波，可以推测宇宙线在星际的加速机构的磁场是有规律的，但是这种高极化是在地面观测到的，无线电电波经过大气层的时候，有可能被吸收和发射，所以可能和高空中的实际情况不同，只有用人造卫星观测才能了解到真实情况。张文裕说，在科学史上，科学本身的问题，往往由于新技术而得到迅速、巨大的发展，苏联这两颗人造卫星的发射成功，在科学史上恐怕是最伟大的技术成就，今后各门科学将由此而得到巨大进展是可以预言的。
    据新华社4日讯　中国科学院副院长李四光4日就苏联发射第二颗人造卫星成功发表谈话说：10月4日，苏联发射了第一颗人造地球卫星。不过一个月，苏联又发射了远比第一颗人造地球卫星复杂得多、重得多的第二颗人造地球卫星，并且成功地把具有高级神经系统的动物，在不断检查它的生理活动的装置下，送到了高空。这又在宇宙空间的探索工作中，打开了一条新的道路。这不仅显示了苏联科学家在人类征服宇宙的科学事业上又迈进了一大步，而且证明了苏联在科学技术许多部门中已经有了革命意义的发展。
    对苏联科学家、工程师和职工们这样伟大的成就，我们中国科学工作者感到无比的敬仰和兴奋，也以兄弟般的情谊感到十分骄傲。
    我们更以极大的热情期待着在不久的将来，苏联发射的人造月球卫星、带人的可以回到地球的卫星在宇宙空间运行。
