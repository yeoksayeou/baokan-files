Beijing's Asphalt Roads	Jin Shoushen

	Beijing had roads one year before I was born. I can say I've seen Beijing have roads since birth. Because of this, I have many thoughts. In the past – forty-some years ago – how many roads did Beijing have? Very few. Now – after liberation – almost every street and alley in the city and every avenue in the suburbs has a road. Moreover, all the main lines have been 100% paved with asphalt. Even the small alley where I live in a remote corner of the city is paved with asphalt. My feelings can't help but be more and deeper.

	In the past, what were the conditions of Beijing's roads? Simply put: the roads in the city were uneven with potholes. Asphalt roads were even scarcer. Suddenly, a road on a main street was paved. Suddenly, half a road was built in a hutong. Then, without asking, you knew that a high official must live in this hutong, and this high official must be using a car to travel in and out on that half-paved road. This was called "Where there's an official, there's a road!" In the suburbs, there was only one: the road from Xizhimen to the Summer Palace (now only the slow lane from the south end of Haidian to Weijiacun is the original road site). It was built in 1906. The road was not wide, but still only the middle was rolled with gravel and the sides were paved with stone slabs. Ordinary people riding mule carts (the transportation from Xizhimen to Haidian, called "tangzi carts" at the time) were only allowed to take the stone slab road. One trip to Haidian would cause a headache for three days from the bumping. I rode tangzi carts many times. One day, I had the good fortune to meet old worker Liu Wenfu, who originally built this road and was also the first to build roads in Beijing. When we talked about the story of riding tangzi carts back then, he laughed and said, "It's not as comfortable as taking the bus and walking on the asphalt road now! That gravel road in the middle was built for the Empress Dowager Cixi!" That's right. Beijing didn't have roads before. There were only high earthen Yong roads standing in the center of the street. Otherwise, how could someone use "three feet of dust without wind, a street of mud when it rains" to describe Beijing? In 1904, because the Qing government was very "generous" in signing the traitorous Treaty of Xin Chou, Germany gifted two road rollers to the Empress Dowager Cixi. With road rollers, they started rolling roads. Which road to roll first? For the convenience of foreigners entering the palace and for "appearance", they evicted the vendors from Donghuamen Street, established Dong'an Market (1904), and then rolled Donghuamen Street as the first road. Because foreigners occupied the Legation Quarter, they rolled Chongwenmen Street next to the Legation Quarter as the second road. These all happened in 1905. Because the Empress Dowager Cixi and Emperor Guangxu had to go to the Summer Palace every year, after the above two roads were built, they built the third road from Xizhimen to the Summer Palace. These were the first three roads in Beijing. As for asphalt roads? The asphalt road in the Legation Quarter was built by the "Legation Corps" – the imperialist representatives in China, so we won't talk about it. In addition, the first asphalt road was Shijia Hutong outside Qianmen, where wealthy merchants gathered. The second asphalt road was the middle section of West Chang'an Street in front of the "Presidential Palace". This was also thirty years ago.

	Let's talk about rolling roads again. To roll roads, there must be road-rolling workers. A group of road-rolling workers were transferred from Tianjin. Liu Wenfu, who was eighteen at the time and is now seventy years old, took root in Beijing in 1905. He and his partners began to conquer the "three feet of dust without wind, a street of mud when it rains." The changes in Beijing's road appearance are also the changes in the life history of these old workers. In the past, most of Beijing's roads were gravel roads. The first few roads built even used gravel from Zhoukoudian. When rolling, the gravel was rolled twice and poured with peach blossom paste twice. After the rain, not only would the road surface not be damaged, but in the words of old man Liu, "After the rain, when the water washes over it, it looks like chrysanthemums." Later, it didn't work anymore. When the gravel road was washed by water, the soil washed away, and the road surface became like the bottom of a mountain stream. People wearing thin-soled shoes didn't dare to walk on it. Why was this? An old worker, Wang Ji, who started working on road-rolling in 1923 and whose father was Liu Wenfu's assistant, told me: At that time, the male and female servants in the homes of the big and small officials managing the road construction team were all paid from the road construction team's expenses! After the victory, it was even worse. Except for the concrete road built from Pinganli to Kuanjie for the convenience of Chiang Kai-shek coming to Beijing to his "headquarters", all the gravel roads were built in winter. Can you build roads in winter? When building roads in winter, the water and soil freeze together. Wouldn't the road surface be as smooth as a mirror when the road roller goes over it! This is called "using the original soil to build the original wall"! What happens after the thaw next spring? What to do? Let the citizens walk on the bottom of the mountain stream for another year! Comrade Wang Ji used a number to illustrate this situation. He said, "In 1923, Beijing only had seven road rollers. Except for one that was transferred to Baoding, the remaining six road rollers were half rolling roads and half idle; when Beijing was liberated in 1949, there were only sixteen road rollers, but only two could roll roads; now, there are one hundred and one, not only can they all work, but they are not enough!"

	Speaking of the road surface of Beijing's roads, before the War of Resistance Against Japan, there were very few asphalt roads. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, only the Japanese "Road Construction Company" built a few asphalt roads (mainly the one in front of the Drum Tower). After Japan surrendered, it can be said that almost no asphalt roads were built. After liberation, too many roads were built, and the number of asphalt roads also increased a lot. Not counting the asphalt roads that were combined into one (such as Fuxingmen Avenue, which is an asphalt road of 1,520 meters long formed by combining Baozi Street and Old Ministry of Justice Street into one asphalt road 35 meters wide), the length of asphalt roads alone, if 1949 is taken as 100, increased to 262 by the end of 1956. The width has also expanded from the widest 13 meters of asphalt roads in Beijing in the past to the widest 41 meters of the west section of Chang'an Street. Today's Beijing asphalt roads are so bright! Talking about today's roads being flat, wide, and long, old man Liu Wenfu, who has been rolling roads for fifty years, from rolling gravel roads to rolling asphalt roads, is extremely excited and said, "In 1954, I had only rolled roads for fifty years, and I was still fine. The leadership insisted on me retiring and taking money for nothing. Now I receive a pension every month, and I almost always walk to get it. Such a flat asphalt road, I should walk on it more!" I said, "It's not close from Guanyuan to Wukesong!" "Not far, not far. Although asphalt roads have also been built from Deshengmen to the Ming Tombs, I can't walk there – because that's a hundred li!" He laughed heartily, and I also realized the happiness of today because of his laughter. (Attached picture)

    北京的柏油马路	金受申
    北京的有马路，比我出生早一年，我可以说是从出生就看见北京有马路了吧。就因为这个缘故，我才有了很多的感想。过去——四十几年的过去，北京有多少条马路呢？那是很少的。现在——解放后，是几乎城内没有一条街巷、郊外没有一条大道没有马路的，而且凡是主要干线，都百分之百地铺了柏油路面，就是我住家在僻处城隅的一条小巷，也铺了柏油路面，我的感想，就不禁更多更加深了。
    过去，北京的马路，是什么情况呢？简单的说来：城里的马路，是坑坎不平的，柏油路更是少得可怜；忽然，大街上一条马路铺平了，忽然，胡同里修了半条马路，那不用问，这条胡同里，一定住着大官，而且这个大官，一定是从修平了的那半条马路出入走汽车的，这就叫“有官就有路嘛！”郊外，只有一条，那就是西直门到颐和园这条马路（现在只有海淀南头到魏家村的慢行车道，是原来马路旧址），这是1906年修的，马路并不宽，但仍只中间轧石碴，两边铺石板，老百姓坐骡车（从西直门到海淀的交通工具，当时叫“趟子车”）的，只许走石板路，去一次海淀，颠簸得头要疼三天。我是坐过许多次趟子车的，有一天，我幸运地会见了最初修这条马路的、也是修北京第一条马路的老工人刘文富老大爷，谈起当年坐趟子车的故事来，他笑了，说：“没有坐公共汽车、走现在的柏油路舒服啊！那中间的石碴路，是给西太后修的马路啊！”不错，北京从先没有马路，只有矗立在街心很高的土甬路，要不然怎么会有人用“无风三尺土，下雨一街泥”来形容北京呢。到1904年，德国因为清朝政府签订卖国的辛丑条约很“慷慨”，就赠送给西太后两部轧路机，有了轧路机，轧马路吧，先轧哪条路呢？为了外国人进宫方便和为了“观瞻”，驱逐了东华门大街的摊商。建立了东安市场（1904年），随之先轧东华门大街这第一条马路；因为外国人窃据了东交民巷，再轧挨着东交民巷的崇文门大街这第二条马路，这都是1905年的事。因为西太后、光绪皇帝每年要去颐和园，就在上边所说两条马路修成以后，又修了西直门到颐和园的这第三条马路。这就是北京最初的三条马路。柏油路呢？东交民巷里的柏油路，是“公使团”——帝国主义驻华代表修的，不去说它。另外，第一条柏油路，是财阀麇集的前门外施家胡同，第二条柏油路，是“总统府”前的西长安街中段，这也是三十年前的事了。
    还是从轧马路谈吧。轧马路嘛，就要有轧路工人，一批轧路工人，就从天津调来了。当时十八岁、现在七十岁的刘文富老大爷，从1905年，就在北京扎了根，他和他的伙伴们，开始征服那无风三尺土，下雨一街泥。北京马路面貌的变化，也就是这些位老工人生活史的变化。过去，北京的马路，大部分是石碴路，最先修的几条马路，还用周口店石碴，轧的时候，轧两次石碴，灌两次桃花浆，下雨以后，不但路面不坏，用刘老大爷的话说：“下雨以后，让水一冲，真像一朵朵菊花似的。”后来，就不行了，石碴路被水一冲，土冲跑了，路面就成山涧底了，穿薄底鞋的人，简直不敢走。为什么这样呢？一位从1923年参加了轧路工作、他父亲是刘文富的助手的老工人王济同志告诉过我：那时候，管理筑路队的大小长官家里的男女佣人，都是从筑路队里开支啊！胜利后，更糟透了，除了为蒋介石来北京到他的“行辕”方便，修了一条表面平正、从平安里到宽街的混凝土路以外，所有的石碴路，都是冬天修的。冬天能修路吗？冬天修路，水和土冻结起来，不是轧路机过去，路面就平得和镜子一样了嘛！这叫“原土打原墙”！明年春天，化冻以后怎么办？怎么办，让市民再走一年山涧底吧！王济同志用一个数字，说明了这个情况，他说：“1923年，北京只有七部轧路机，除一部调到保定，下余六部轧路机，还半年轧路半年闲放着；1949年北京解放的时候，只有十六部轧路机，却只有两部能轧路的；现在，有一百零一部，不但全部能工作，而且还不够用的哩！”
    提到北京马路的路面，抗战前，柏油路是很少的了。抗战期间，只由日本的“筑路公司”修了几条柏油路（主要的是鼓楼前一条），日本投降后，可以说基本没修柏油路。解放后，修的马路太多了，柏油路也增加了很多，不算两条并成一条的柏油路（如复兴门大街，系由报子街、旧刑部街两条一千五百二十公尺的柏油路，并成为一条宽三十五公尺的柏油路），光柏油路的长度，如果以1949年为一百，到1956年底，就增加到二百六十二了。宽度，也由从前北京柏油路最宽的十三公尺，展到西长安街最宽部分的四十一公尺，今天的北京柏油路，是多么眼亮啊！谈到现在的马路又平、又宽、又长来，轧了五十年马路、从轧石碴路到轧柏油路的刘文富老大爷，兴奋极了，说：“1954年，我才轧了五十年马路，我还成呢，领导上非叫我退休、白拿钱不可，我现在每月领退休金，差不多都是走着去，这么平的柏油马路，还不多走走！”我说：“您从官园到五棵松，可不近啊！”“不远，不远。从德胜门到十三陵，虽然也修了柏油路，我可走不了去——因为那是一百里地啊！”他哈哈大笑起来，我也为他这大笑，意识到今天的幸福来。（附图片）
