    The American policy of strength is in deep crisis
    Wan Guang
    The two Soviet "little moons" rotating around the Earth circle after circle, causing jubilation and praise among the masses of people around the world, have caused confusion and panic in the American ruling group. This is because the fundamental policy of the United States in international relations—the so-called "position of strength" policy—has suffered a severe blow.
    The policy of strength pursued by the United States after World War II was directed at three aspects.
    Towards socialist countries, the United States indulged in the self-intoxication of a fabricated "superiority in strength," refusing to recognize the reality of life. It repeatedly declared that one of the prerequisites for reaching an agreement with the Soviet Union was that the Soviet Union agree to allow imperialist countries to "liberate" the Eastern European people's democratic countries. It occupied China's Taiwan, refused to recognize China, and Dulles said not long ago that the goal of American policy was to "do everything possible" to make the socialist regime "disappear" in China. It refused to recognize the German Democratic Republic and insisted that the condition for resolving the German unification issue was the annexation of East Germany by West Germany, which participated in the Western bloc. It refused to reach a disarmament agreement with the Soviet Union, insisted on developing a "nuclear deterrent," and constantly threatened socialist countries with "massive retaliation" and "brinkmanship."
    Towards national independence countries and national liberation movements in colonial countries, the United States also formulated and implemented its policies based on its so-called "superiority in strength." In Southeast Asia, it replaced France's position and ruled South Vietnam. It also controlled the Manila military bloc, which it manufactured, and threatened to place Laos, Cambodia, Malaya and other countries under its "protection." In the Middle East, the United States openly announced the "Eisenhower Doctrine" after the weakening of British and French strength, seeking to fill the "vacuum" in the Middle East with American strength. It even openly used force to threaten the national liberation movement in the Middle East. It used the Sixth Fleet as the "big stick" of the "Eisenhower Doctrine," making Jordan a tool under its wing, and now it is attempting to repeat this trick in Syria. In the eyes of the United States, it seems that it is not the mid-twentieth century, but the era when "gunboat diplomacy" prevailed in the nineteenth century.
    Towards its allies, the United States also maintained its position as the commanding leader based on its "superiority in strength." As Western journalists described, Dulles often attended military bloc meetings "with a whip" to urge other countries to expand their arms and prepare for war in accordance with the American strategic plan.
    These are the set of aggressive and war policies pursued by the United States based on its so-called "superiority in strength." Originally, in the eyes of people who soberly assessed the international reality, the United States had long lost this "superiority in strength." The result of the competition in the Korean War showed that the forces of peace are greater than the imperialist war forces headed by the United States. The United States also knew this, but it dared not admit it. It wanted to "swell its face to look fat," pretending that it monopolized "lethal weapons" and had "superiority in strength." The United States once boasted that it monopolized atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs, and after these claims were proven to be bankrupt by facts, it boasted that it could rely on many bases around socialist countries to carry out "massive retaliation" with a "nuclear deterrent" against the Soviet Union, making it impossible for the Soviet Union to retaliate. However, on August 26 this year, the Soviet Union announced the development of an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of being launched anywhere in the world. Then, one artificial satellite after another was launched. Now, even in the United States, except for people like the American naval officer Bennett who are still calling Soviet satellites "a piece of iron," there is a chorus of mourning over the loss of "superiority in strength."
    American commentator Harry Schwartz concluded that the American government "has made a series of major errors in estimating the scientific and military capabilities of the Soviet Union over the past decade," and that the American "consistent tendency to underestimate the Soviet Union's capabilities" is "substituting wishes for facts" and a "morbid sense of superiority" (October 7, "New York Times"). Another well-known American commentator, Walter Lippmann, also had to painfully admit:
  "The Eisenhower-Dulles foreign policy is based on subjective estimates of our (i.e., American) own strength and self-deceptive ideas." (October 15, "Washington Post") The various specialized agencies under the U.S. Department of Defense clearly stated in their reports to the U.S. National Security Council that the United States should abandon a war against the Soviet Union that has no hope of winning, and that the possibility of "massive retaliation" on which the United States' current entire strategy is based has definitely been shattered.
    These days, the American "policy of strength" continues to suffer shameful failures in the Middle East. Encouraged by the fact that the world's peace forces have been greatly strengthened due to the increase in the Soviet Union's prestige, Egypt is more firmly holding high the banner of national independence, Syria is more bravely carrying out the struggle to defend national independence, and the "Eisenhower Doctrine" has suffered a serious setback in the Middle East. It is widely circulated among political figures in London and Paris that the struggle launched by Syria to defend national independence and the Soviet Union's stern warning against the American conspiracy to interfere in Syria made Dulles's "face turn green in an alarming way" during private talks with British and French representatives.
    The launch of the Soviet satellite caused a violent shock in the ruling groups of countries in military blocs controlled by the United States, especially in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. The British "Manchester Guardian" said that there is currently a "serious crisis of confidence tormenting the Western alliance." At the Western European Union conference held in Strasbourg in October, parliamentarians from the seven Western European countries expressed a lack of confidence and anxiety about the leadership of the United States, and they advocated that Western Europe should not submit to the United States as it had in the past. According to American newspapers, the "defeatist mood" of Western Europe towards the American policy of strength is spreading. The Western alliance maintained by the American "position of strength" is being fiercely impacted by forces demanding to break free from American control.
    Under the current balance of world power, not only is the peaceful neutrality tendency of nationally independent countries strengthening, but neutralist sentiment is also developing greatly in countries participating in American military blocs. The "New York Herald Tribune" published a rather interesting "world public opinion poll" report on October 13. The results of its survey in eleven capitalist countries were that "if a war breaks out between the United States and the Soviet Union, then the majority of people in all major (capitalist) countries around the world would demand that their governments do everything possible to remain neutral." The survey report said that the British public believes "let the Yanks do it," and these words "resonate everywhere on the continent of Western Europe."
    All of the above illustrates the depth of the crisis in the American "policy of strength."
    What will the United States do in the future? Will it learn its lesson and change course?
    The official answer announced by the United States is: no. On November 6, Khrushchev once again proposed that capitalist and socialist countries hold high-level talks to stop the arms race and achieve peaceful coexistence, but in a speech a day later, Eisenhower actually rejected the proposal by not mentioning the issue at all. The explanation given by American officials is that the United States cannot hold talks with the Soviet Union until it has restored its "position of strength." It still insists on the old policy of strength!
    That is the way it is. The United States is using the Soviet satellite achievements to clamor about the so-called "threat to Western security," conspiring to turn the frustration and anxiety of the reactionaries in the imperialist camp into anti-Soviet and arms race hysteria, so as to continue to gather these countries around the United States and accelerate arms expansion and war preparations in a more frenzied manner to save its "position of strength."
    There is a great uproar in the United States, investigating the reasons for the United States' backwardness in satellites and rockets. It is very clear that the American ruling group is not concerned with engaging in scientific and peaceful competition with the Soviet Union in areas such as artificial satellites, but with allocating more funds, concentrating more forces, and using the development of science to carry out arms races such as rockets and nuclear weapons. Eisenhower's consecutive speeches on November 7 and 13 were a program demanding that the people tighten their belts in order to accelerate the nuclear arms race. American officials have also revealed that billions of dollars in military spending will be added soon. In this regard, it should be mentioned that American economic activity is declining, the shadow of economic depression is approaching the entire capitalist world, and the American monopoly capitalist group is urgently hoping to tide over the difficulties with greater military spending in order to continue to obtain high profits.
    In its effort to save its "position of strength," the United States is doing its best to prevent its allies from losing confidence in the policy of strength. The Eisenhower-Macmillan joint statement emphasized "mutual dependence" between Western countries in the future. It is said that at the North Atlantic Treaty Organization meeting in December, the United States will explain the existing "strength" of the United States to its allies and make plans to exchange scientific information and strengthen cooperation in the development of science and technology with its allies.
    However, these are only one side of the so-called "mutual dependence," and not the main side. It is reported that the main task of the United States at the North Atlantic Treaty Organization meeting in December is to have Western European allies support a "New Look" military plan. Some of the proposed items in the revealed "restructuring of Western military deployments" include: the United States first establishing "nuclear weapon storage" in Western Europe and then in other regions, for which allies will provide more bases to house American rockets, nuclear weapons, etc., while the control of storage and bases will be in the hands of the United States; to "unify the military system" so that the armies of all countries are commanded by American generals; to gradually "unify" the political and economic policies of various countries; and finally, to gradually "unify" the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the Baghdad Pact, the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, and the Pan-American Group into a "unified" war machine on the same "restructuring" basis.
    From these contents, the American conspiracy is very clear: The United States is now using the method of taking one step back and two steps forward towards its allies, forcing them to further surrender their sovereignty and further bind them tightly to the chariot of frenzied arms preparations driven by the United States.
    The question now facing the rulers of Western countries is whether they will further fall into the American net against their own interests. It should be pointed out that the British rulers have played an active role in the stubborn actions of the United States in adhering to the policy of strength. The British rulers are obviously complacent about having improved their position as an American partner by taking advantage of the United States' crisis, and are obviously still attempting to unite the strength of the United States to continue to suppress the Asian and African national liberation movements. However, the policy of strength has already been met with obstacles everywhere. The British rulers are willing to act as American partners, regardless of whether they become big partners or small partners, which will only further damage Britain's true international status, and the British rulers will only lose credibility among the public in their own country as a result. Moreover, the British government's own published defense white paper also admits that the British homeland cannot be defended in a nuclear war. The British rulers must continue to follow the United States in playing the dangerous game of nuclear arms race, which is even more so walking the path of playing with fire and burning oneself. For the rulers of other countries who want to follow the United States, they will only end up with similar results.
    The American conspiracy to save its "position of strength" will inevitably arouse stronger opposition from the people of all countries and will further intensify the contradictions within the imperialist camp. The American policy of strength building has already been rotten and riddled with holes. The American struggle may be able to brush up the rotten pillars, but fundamentally it is unable to prevent the collapse of this building.
    For the policies of all countries to be effective, they must first face reality. And recognizing the reality of the current balance of world power requires abandoning the policy of strength, stopping the Cold War and the arms race through negotiations, no longer allowing wars to occur, and establishing relations between countries on the basis of equality, peaceful coexistence, and peaceful competition.
    The American policy of strength is bound to fail because it ignores reality. Of course, although the United States does not have a "superiority in strength," it still has the strength to exacerbate international tensions and endanger world peace. The people of all countries will not lower their vigilance in this regard. The United States continues to adhere to the policy of strength, and what awaits it is a series of new and even more disastrous failures.

    美国实力政策的深刻危机
    万光
    两颗苏联“小月亮”绕着地球在一圈又一圈的旋转，它在全世界人民群众中引起一片欢腾和赞扬，而在美国统治集团中却引起一团混乱和惊慌。这是因为美国在国际关系中的根本政策——所谓“实力地位”政策遭到了严重的打击。
    美国在第二次世界大战结束后奉行的实力政策是针对着三个方面的。
    对社会主义国家，美国自我陶醉于虚构的“实力优势”，拒绝承认生活现实，它一再宣布过，同苏联达成协议的先决条件之一，是要苏联同意让帝国主义国家来“解放”东欧人民民主国家。它霸占着中国的台湾，拒绝承认中国，杜勒斯不久以前还说过，美国政策的目标是要“尽一切可能”使社会主义政权在中国“消逝”。它拒绝承认民主德国，坚持解决德国统一问题的条件是由参加西方集团的西德来并吞东德。它拒绝同苏联达成裁军协议，坚持要发展“核威慑力量”，并且不断用“大规模报复”、“战争边缘”来威胁社会主义国家。
    对民族独立国家和殖民地国家民族解放运动，美国也是凭着它的所谓“实力优势”来制订和执行它的政策的。在东南亚，它取代了法国的地位而统治南越，它又驾驭着一手制造的马尼拉军事集团而威胁着要把老挝、柬埔寨、马来亚等国置于它的“保护”之下。在中东，美国在英法实力削弱后公然宣布了“艾森豪威尔主义”，要以美国实力来填补中东的“真空”，它甚至公开使用武力来威胁中东的民族解放运动。它把第六舰队作为“艾森豪威尔主义”的“大棒子”，使约旦成为它卵翼下的工具，现在又企图在叙利亚如法泡制。在美国眼里，似乎现在并不是二十世纪中叶，而还是十九世纪“炮舰外交”横行的时代。
    对它的盟国，美国同样也是凭着它的“实力优势”，维持它发号施令的盟主地位。像西方记者形容的，杜勒斯经常“带着鞭子”去参加军事集团会议，督促其他国家按照美国战略计划进行扩军备战。
    这些就是美国在所谓“实力优势”基础上奉行的一套侵略和战争政策。本来，在清醒估计国际现实的人们看来，美国早就没有这种“实力优势”了。朝鲜战争中较量的结果就表明，和平力量大于以美国为首的帝国主义战争力量。美国也是知道这一点的，但是它不敢承认这一点，它要“打肿了脸充胖子”，装着自己垄断着“致命武器”而有“实力优势”。美国曾经先后吹嘘过它垄断原子弹和氢弹，而在这些说法被事实证明破产之后，它又吹嘘它可以依仗在社会主义国家周围的许多基地对苏联进行“核威慑力量”的“大规模报复”而使苏联无法还击。然而，今年8月26日，苏联宣布制成了能够发射到世界上任何地方的洲际弹道火箭，接着，一个又一个的人造卫星放射出去了。现在，即使在美国，除了像美国海军将领贝奈特之流还在把苏联卫星说成是“一块铁片”之外，已经到处都是一片关于“实力优势”丧失的哀鸣声了。
    美国评论员哈里·施瓦茨得出这样的结论：美国官方“过去十年中对苏联的科学能力和军事能力的估计方面犯了一系列重大错误”，美国这种“一贯低估苏联能力的倾向”是“以愿望代替事实”，是一种“病态优越感”（10月7日“纽约时报”）。美国另一位知名的评论员华尔特·李普曼也不得不忍痛承认：
  “艾森豪威尔—杜勒斯外交政策是建立在对我们（即美国）自己的力量所作的主观估计和自我欺骗的想法的基础上”的。（10月15日“华盛顿邮报”）美国国防部所属各专门机构在它们向美国国家安全委员会的报告中明白表示，美国应该放弃对苏联进行一场没有丝毫获胜希望的战争，并认为美国目前整个战略所依据的“大规模报复”的可能性已经肯定地破灭了。
    这些日子来，美国“实力政策”正继续在中东遭到丢脸的失败。在世界和平力量由于苏联威望的提高而大大加强这一事实的鼓舞之下，埃及更坚定地高举着民族独立的旗帜，叙利亚更勇敢地进行着保卫国家独立的斗争，“艾森豪威尔主义”在中东已经遭到了严重的挫折。伦敦和巴黎政界人士广泛流传着，叙利亚展开的保卫国家独立的斗争以及苏联就美国干涉叙利亚的阴谋提出的严正警告，使得杜勒斯在同英法代表的私人谈话中“脸色发青令人吃惊”。
    苏联卫星的发射，在美国控制的军事集团国家，首先是北大西洋集团国家统治集团里引起了剧烈的震动。英国“曼彻斯特卫报”说，目前出现了“折磨着西方联盟的严重的信心危机”。10月间在斯特拉斯堡举行的西欧联盟会议上，西欧七国议员们纷纷对于美国的领导地位表示缺乏信心和不安，他们主张西欧不要像过去那样屈从美国。用美国报纸的说法，西欧对美国实力政策的“失败主义情绪”在蔓延。美国目前“实力地位”所维持的西方联盟正受到要求摆脱美国控制力量的猛烈冲击。
    在目前世界力量的对比下，不只是民族独立国家的和平中立倾向在加强，而且在参加美国军事集团国家里中立主义情绪也在大大发展。“纽约先驱论坛报”在10月13日发表了一个颇有意思的“世界民意测验”调查报告，它在十一个资本主义国家测验的结果是“如果美国和苏联之间发生战争，那么世界各地的各个主要（资本主义）国家里的大多数人民都会要求他们的政府尽一切可能来保持中立”。调查报告说，英国的公众认为“让美国佬去干吧”，这种话“在西欧大陆到处都得到共鸣”。
    所有以上这些，都说明了美国“实力政策”危机的深刻程度。
    美国今后怎么做呢？是接受教训，改弦更张吗？
    美国官方已经宣布的回答是：不。11月6日赫鲁晓夫又一次提出资本主义国家和社会主义国家举行高级会谈来停止军备竞赛和实现和平共处的建议，但是艾森豪威尔在隔了一天的演说中用根本不提这个问题的方式实际上拒绝了这个建议。美国官员的解释是，在美国没有恢复“实力地位”以前，不能同苏联举行会谈。还是坚持老一套的实力政策！
    事情就是这样，美国正在利用苏联卫星成就叫嚷所谓“对西方安全威胁”，阴谋把帝国主义阵营国家反动派的沮丧不安转变为反苏和军备竞赛歇斯底里，以便把这些国家继续纠集在美国周围，更加疯狂地进行扩军备战，来挽救“实力地位”。
    美国国内正在大吵大闹，追究美国在卫星和火箭方面落后的原因。很清楚的是，美国统治集团关心的不是同苏联在人造卫星等方面进行科学和平竞赛，而是关心着拨更多款项、集中更多力量、利用发展科学来进行火箭、核武器等军备竞赛。艾森豪威尔11月7日和13日连续发表的演说就是要求人民勒紧裤腰，以加速核军备竞赛的纲领。美国官员也已经透露，即将增拨几十亿美元的军事开支。在这方面应该提到，美国经济活动正在衰退，经济萧条的阴影又在逼近整个资本主义世界，美国垄断资本集团正急迫指望以更大的军事开支来度过难关，以求继续获得高额利润。
    在挽救“实力地位”的努力中，美国正在竭力要使盟国不要对实力政策丧失信心。艾森豪威尔—麦克米伦联合声明中强调今后西方国家间要“互相依赖”。据说，在12月间北大西洋集团会议上，美国要向盟国说明美国现有的“实力”，作出计划来同盟国交换科学情报和加强发展科学技术方面的合作。
    但是，这些只是所谓“互相依赖”的一面，而且并非主要一面。消息说，美国在12月间北大西洋集团会议上的主要任务是要西欧盟国支持一项“新面貌”军事计划。透露出来的“改组西方军事部署”的一些拟议中的项目有：美国先在西欧后在其他地区设立“核武器储存”，为此盟国要提供更多的基地来安置美国火箭、核武器等，而储存和基地的控制权则在美国手中；要“统一军事系统”使各国军队都受美国将领指挥；要逐步“统一”各国政治和经济政策；最后，要逐步把北大西洋集团、巴格达条约、东南亚条约和泛美集团等在同样“改组” 基础上“统一”成为一个“统一的”备战机器。
    从这些内容来看，美国阴谋很清楚了：美国现在对它盟国是用退一步进两步的手法，逼迫盟国进一步交出主权，进一步把它们紧紧地束缚在由美国驾驶的疯狂备战的战车上。
    现在摆在西方国家统治者面前的问题是，它们是否要违背本国利益进一步陷入美国的罗网。应该指出的是，英国统治者已经在美国坚持实力政策的顽固作为中起了积极助手的作用。英国统治者显然由于乘美国之危而提高了一些自己作为美国伙计的地位而沾沾自喜，显然还企图联合美国实力来继续镇压亚非民族解放运动。但是，实力政策已经如此处处碰壁，英国统治者甘心充当美国的伙计，不管成为大伙计还是小伙计，都只会进一步损害英国真正的国际地位，英国统治者也只会因此而在本国公众中丧失信誉。而且，英国政府自己发表的国防白皮书也承认英伦本土在核战争中是无法防卫的，英国统治者还要继续追随美国玩弄核军备竞赛的危险把戏，更是在走着玩火自焚的道路。对于要跟美国走的其他国家统治者来说，也只会落得类似的结果。
    美国挽救“实力地位”的阴谋，必将激起各国人民更加强烈的反对，必将进一步加剧帝国主义阵营内部的矛盾。美国实力政策大厦已经腐朽和千疮百孔了，美国的挣扎也许还能粉刷一番腐朽了的柱石，但是根本上是无法阻止这座大厦的倒塌的。
    一切国家的政策要能有成效，首先必须正视现实。而承认目前世界力量对比的现实，就应该放弃实力政策，通过谈判来停止冷战和军备竞赛，不再允许发生战争，在平等共处和和平竞赛的基础上建立各国间的关系。
    美国实力政策必然失败，在于它无视现实。当然，美国虽然没有“实力优势”，它现在还是有实力来加剧国际紧张局势，危害世界和平的。对此各国人民不会放松警惕。美国继续坚持实力政策，等待着它的将是一连串新的、更加惨重的失败。
