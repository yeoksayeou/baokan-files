Visiting the Former Residence of Dimitrov
　　Ge Baoquan

Dimitrov's name is extraordinarily familiar to the broad masses of our Chinese people. Whenever we speak of this glorious name, we recall how this outstanding son of the Bulgarian people and prominent activist in the international workers' movement led the Bulgarian people in an armed uprising in 1923; how he made a world-shaking accusation and defense in the Leipzig court in 1933; how he called upon the people of all countries to unite against fascism and defend world peace through the Communist International in the years after 1935; and finally, how he led the Bulgarian people, who had seized revolutionary power in 1946, to establish the People's Republic of Bulgaria. For this reason, everyone who visits the Bulgarian capital, Sofia, will pay homage to his mausoleum and visit his former residence with a feeling of reverence.

In the center of Sofia, there is "September 9th" Square, named in memory of the armed uprising on September 9, 1944. This is where the residents of Sofia stroll and gather after dusk every day, and also where the Bulgarian people hold military parades and mass parades every May Day and National Day. As you walk through this square, you can see a solemn but simple square building made of white stone, surrounded and enveloped by greenery, near the city center garden. Engraved under its front eaves are the words "Georgi Dimitrov," which is exactly where Dimitrov lies at rest. There is a door in front of the tomb leading to the burial chamber, where Dimitrov's remains lie as if alive in a crystal coffin. Each person visiting the tomb walks slowly past his side along the designated route, admires his remains, and exits through the door behind the tomb. On the upper layer of the tomb's exterior, each side has four square pillars. After dusk, pale green lights shine from behind the stone pillars, especially when walking through "September 9th" Square and the city center garden late at night, you will feel that this building appears even more solemn and beautiful.

About a dozen streets away from the city center, at No. 66 Opulchenska Street (literally translated as Militia Street), a quiet white two-story building also attracts every visitor with its historical significance and simple layout. This is Dimitrov's former residence in Sofia. As we approach the house, we first see a marble plaque nailed to the wall facing the street, with a relief of Dimitrov's image engraved on it, and the following words written below: "The leader and teacher of the Bulgarian people, Georgi Dimitrov, lived and worked here from 1888 to 1923." This short but profoundly meaningful sentence describes the close relationship between Dimitrov and this house. It tells us that Dimitrov moved from the countryside to the city with his parents at the age of six, and his revolutionary activities for more than 20 years thereafter were spent in this simple small building.

We pushed open the wooden door facing the street and entered a quiet small garden. Benches were placed under the greenery, and bright roses and cannas bloomed in the flower beds. Cool spring water flowed from the faucet installed in the corner of the garden. Although Dimitrov's former residence is a two-story small building, its lower level is very low, equivalent to a basement, and the windows are opened not far from the ground. As we entered the low underground level, we first saw a small room on the side near the garden, with light shining in from two windows. The floor was covered with a home-woven long carpet, and near the window were a weaving machine and a spinning wheel used by Dimitrov's mother, Parashkeva, which is a common scene in Bulgarian peasant families. Opposite the weaving machine, near the window, was a small table and chair, where Dimitrov read during his childhood and youth. He used the light of an oil lamp to sit next to this table and eagerly read Botev's revolutionary poems and the writings of Dimitar Blagoev, as well as the works of Belinsky, Chernyshevsky, and Gorky, and also read the classic works of Marxism. On the side of the underground level near the street, there was another room of the same size, covered with home-woven carpets. In the center of the room was a low round table, with a tablecloth on which were placed basins, plates, and wooden spoons, where the entire Dimitrov family sat on the floor to eat. There was also a small room between these two rooms, which served as a small kitchen for the whole family. Dimitrov lived on the underground level during his childhood and youth, and after he got married and moved upstairs, it became the residence of his parents.

Now we leave the underground level, turn back to the garden, and walk through the two spacious doors opening towards the flower bed to reach the upper level of this small building. The side near the garden is a bright room. The room contains two iron beds, covered with clean white sheets, and the head of the bed has four pillows embroidered with national-style lace. This is the bedroom of Dimitrov and his wife, Luba, who moved upstairs after they got married in 1906. Next to the bedroom is a small room, where the food cabinet is placed. Next to the food cabinet is a tap and a wash basin, and there is a wooden cabinet under the basin, where Dimitrov used to hide secret documents and propaganda materials. There is also a small wooden door on the ceiling of this small room, which can lead to the roof, where Dimitrov also hid. On the street side upstairs is Dimitrov's office. In the middle of the room is a desk, with a desk lamp, telephone, and stationery on it. On the small bookshelf near the window are photos of him and his wife. Against the wall is a large bookcase and a seven-story bookshelf. The furnishings in this office are very simple and plain, giving a bright and clean feeling.

The most noteworthy thing in the former residence is the bookshelves, filled with books, placed at the entrance upstairs and in his office. It gives us the impression that Dimitrov was not only an outstanding revolutionary, but also a very knowledgeable person. In the years when he was engaged in the trade union movement, he learned Russian, German, French, and English due to the encouragement of his wife. Dimitrov's collection of books is very rich. In addition to the classic works of Marx, Engels, and Lenin, you can also find philosophical and socialist works by Aristotle, Rousseau, Schopenhauer, Kautsky, Kropotkin, Luxemburg, Kolarov, and many others. Dimitrov also loved literary works very much. As early as 1900, when he was eighteen years old, he read the Russian writer Chernyshevsky's novel "What Is to Be Done?" In 1935, he recalled: "As early as thirty-five years ago, the novel 'What Is to Be Done?' had an unusually profound and indelible influence on me, as a young worker who had just taken the first steps in the Bulgarian revolutionary movement." On Dimitrov's bookshelf, you can find works by Plutarch, Goethe, Lessing, Pushkin, Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, Chekhov, Gorky, and Tagore, among many others. Needless to say, you can also find communist publications and the documents of the Second Congress of the Red International and the Third Congress of the Communist International here. Dimitrov's wife, Luba, made a general catalog of these books in 1918, totaling nearly three thousand volumes. From this, we can also see that Dimitrov not only underwent training and testing in the revolutionary struggle, but also cultivated himself into a revolutionary through self-study and research of theoretical works.

In the garden of Dimitrov's former residence, there is another small house, which displays pictures and historical materials related to Dimitrov from his childhood until the armed uprising in September 1923. Through these pictures and historical materials, we can see the entire process of Dimitrov's revolutionary struggle before 1923. Dimitrov moved from the countryside to Sofia with his parents at the age of six, became a printing worker at the age of twelve, participated in the revolutionary movement at the age of fifteen, and became the organizer of the Sofia Printing Workers' Union at the age of sixteen, and was elected as the secretary of the Printing Workers' Union at the age of eighteen. In 1902, at the age of twenty, he joined the Bulgarian Workers' Social Democratic Party, and in 1904, he began to participate in the organization of the Bulgarian trade union movement. In 1909, he was elected as a member of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Socialist Party and the secretary of the Bulgarian Revolutionary Trade Union Federation. During the First World War, he participated in the Balkan Social Democratic Party Conference held in Sofia in 1915, calling for a struggle against the imperialist war. Under the influence of the October Revolution, when a huge revolutionary wave was set off in Bulgaria, he was arrested for leading revolutionary struggles and strikes. In 1921, he attended the Third Congress of the Communist International held in Moscow and met Lenin for the first time. In September 1923, he and Kolarov led the Bulgarian people in an armed uprising against the fascist regime, which unfortunately failed. From then on, he went into exile abroad, and did not return to his motherland until 1945 after twenty-two years of exile. Dimitrov's revolutionary career is inseparable from the history of the Bulgarian people's heroic revolutionary struggle. He led and organized 1,060 strikes from 1904 to 1923, which can be imagined.

When I visited Bulgaria in mid-June this year, on the eve of the 75th anniversary of Dimitrov's birth (June 18), I paid homage to his tomb and visited his former residence. This visit left a very deep impression on my heart: in his former residence, we can not only feel Dimitrov's greatness, but also see that his noble qualities of frugality and humility are inseparable from his greatness. When leaving his former residence, I wrote these few words in the guest book: "Comrade Dimitrov's revolutionary cause will last forever! His glorious name will always live in our hearts!"

    访问季米特洛夫的故居
    戈宝权
    季米特洛夫的名字，是我们中国广大的人民群众所异常熟悉的。每当讲到这个光辉的名字，我们就会想起这位保加利亚人民的杰出的儿子和国际工人运动的卓越的活动家，怎样在1923年领导了保加利亚人民起来从事武装起义；怎样在1933年来比锡的法庭上作了震动全世界的控诉和辩护；怎样在1935年以后的年代里通过共产国际号召各国人民联合起来反对法西斯主义和保卫世界和平；最后又怎样在1946年领导取得了革命政权的保加利亚人民建立了保加利亚人民共和国。正因为这样，每个访问保加利亚首都索非亚的人，都会怀着崇敬的心情去拜谒他的陵墓和访问他的故居。
    在索非亚的城中心，有个为了纪念1944年9月9日武装起义而命名的“九九”广场。这是索非亚城的居民们在每天黄昏后散步和聚会的场所，也是保加利亚人民每逢五一节和国庆节举行阅兵典礼与群众大游行的地方。当走过这个广场时，就可以看见靠近市中心花园那边，在绿荫的环绕和笼罩之下，有一个用白石砌成的庄严而又朴素的四方形的建筑物。在它的前檐下面刻着“格奥尔基·季米特洛夫”的字样，这就正是季米特洛夫长眠的地方，墓前面有门通到墓室，季米特洛夫遗容宛如生前一样地长眠在墓室当中的水晶棺材里。每个谒墓的人，都沿着指定的路线，从他的身旁慢慢走过，瞻仰了他的遗容之后从墓后的门走出。墓外表的上层，每面各有四个四方形的柱子。每到黄昏之后，就有淡绿色的灯光从石柱后面照射出来，尤其是当夜深人静走过“九九”广场和市中心花园时，你会感觉到这座建筑物显得更加庄严美丽。
    就在离开市中心大概有十几条街远的地方，在幽静的奥普尔青斯卡街（意译为民兵街）的66号，有一所粉刷成白色的两层的小楼房，也以它的历史意义和布置的朴素吸引住每个参观者，这就是季米特洛夫在索非亚城的故居。当我们走近这所房子，首先就看到在迎街的墙壁上钉着一块大理石板，上面刻着季米特洛夫的浮雕像，下面写着：“保加利亚人民的领袖和导师格奥尔基·季米特洛夫在1888年至1923年曾在这里居住过和工作过”。这句简短而又包含着深刻内容的话，写出了季米特洛夫和这所房子的密切关系。它告诉我们：季米特洛夫从六岁起就随着父母从乡村迁居到城里来，他此后二十多年的革命活动时期，都是在这所简朴的小楼房里度过去的。
    我们推开了临街的木门，就走进一个幽静的小花园。在绿荫下面摆着长凳，花坛上盛开着鲜艳的玫瑰花和美人蕉，清凉的泉水从装置在花园一角的水龙头里涌流出来。季米特洛夫的故居虽说是一所两层的小楼房，但它的下层却非常低矮，相当于地下室，而窗子就开在离地面不远的地方。走进低矮的地下层时，我们首先就看到在靠近花园的一边，有一个小房间，光线从两个窗子里透射进来。地板上铺了一条家庭织造的长地毯，靠窗的地方摆着季米特洛夫的母亲帕拉希凯娃用过的一张织布机和一架纺线机，这也是我们在保加利亚农民的家庭里经常见到的情景。在织布机的对面靠窗口的地方，摆着一张小台子和椅子，这是季米特洛夫童年和青年时代读书的地方，他曾经借助了油灯的光亮，坐在这张台子旁边如饥似渴地阅读了波特夫的革命诗歌和季米特里·布拉戈耶夫的著作，别林斯基、车尔尼雪夫斯基和高尔基等人的作品，也阅读过马克思主义的经典论著。在地下层靠近街道的一面，另有一个同样大小的房间，地面上铺满了家庭织造的地毯，房间当中放着一张矮脚的圆台，台布上面摆着盆子、盘子和木制的调羹等物，这是季米特洛夫全家人席地而坐吃饭的地方。在这两个房间当中还有一个小间，是供全家使用的小厨房。季米特洛夫童年和青年时都是住在地下层，直到他结婚搬到楼上居住之后，这里就成为他的父母居住的地方。
    现在我们走出地下层，折回花园，从开向花坛的两扇宽敞的门，就可以走到这所小楼的上层。靠近花园的一边是一个明亮的房间。房间里放着两张铁床，铺着洁白的床单，床头是四个绣着民族形式花边的枕头。这是季米特洛夫和他的夫人柳芭的卧室，他们是在1906年结婚后才搬到楼上住的。卧室的旁边有一个小间，这里摆着食橱，食橱旁边装着自来水龙头和盥洗用的磁盆，磁盆下面有一个木柜，季米特洛夫曾经在里面藏匿过秘密文件和宣传品。在这个小房间的天花板上，还有一个小木门，可以通到屋顶，季米特洛夫也曾住在里面隐藏过。在楼上靠街的地方，是季米特洛夫的办公室。房间当中是写字台，上面放着台灯、电话和文具，靠窗口的小书架上放着他和他的夫人合照的相片，靠墙的地方放着大书橱和一个七层高的书架。这间办公室的陈设，非常简单朴素，有窗明几净的感觉。
    故居里最引人注意的，是摆在楼上进口处和他办公室里的放满了书的书架。它使我们得到这样一个印象：季米特洛夫不只是一位杰出的革命家，同时还是一个非常博学的人。在他从事职工运动的年代里，由于他的夫人的鼓舞，他学习了俄文、德文、法文和英文。季米特洛夫的藏书是非常丰富的。在马克思、恩格斯、列宁等人的经典著作之外，你还可以找到亚理士多德、卢骚、叔本华、考茨基、克鲁泡特金、卢森堡、科拉洛夫等许多人的哲学和社会主义的论著。季米特洛夫也非常喜爱文艺作品。远在1900年他十八岁时，就读过俄国作家车尔尼雪夫斯基的长篇小说“怎么办？”他在1935年曾回忆过：“远在三十五年前，‘怎么办？’这部小说，对于作为一个在保加利亚革命运动中刚走了最初几步路的年青工人的我，曾起了异常深刻和难以磨灭的影响”。在季米特洛夫的书架上，你可以找到普鲁塔尔克、歌德、莱辛、普希金、托尔斯泰、陀斯托耶夫斯基、契可夫、高尔基和泰戈尔等许多人的作品。不用说，你在这里还可以找到共产主义的刊物，红色国际第二次代表大会和共产国际第三次代表大会的文件。季米特洛夫的夫人柳芭在1918年曾把这些书作了一个总编目，总数就将近三千卷。从这里我们也可以看出，季米特洛夫不只是在革命斗争中经受锻炼和考验，他还通过自学和研究理论著作把自己培养成为一个革命家。
    在季米特洛夫故居的花园里，另外还有一间小房子，其中陈列了有关季米特洛夫从童年起直到1923年9月武装起义时为止的图片和史料。通过这些图片和史料，我们可以看到季米特洛夫在1923年以前从事革命斗争的全部过程。季米特洛夫六岁时就随着父母从乡村迁居到索非亚，十二岁起做了印刷工人，十五岁参加革命运动，十六岁就成了索非亚印刷工会的组织者，十八岁当选为印刷工会的书记。1902年二十岁时，他加入了保加利亚工人社会民主党，1904年开始参加领导保加利亚职工运动的组织工作。1909年他就当选为保加利亚社会党中央委员会的委员和保加利亚革命职工总联盟的书记。在第一次世界大战期间，他参加了1915年在索非亚召开的巴尔干社会民主党代表会议，号召为反对帝国主义战争而斗争。在十月革命的影响下，当在保加利亚掀起了巨大的革命浪潮时，他曾因为领导革命斗争和罢工运动而被捕。1921年他出席了在莫斯科举行的共产国际第三次代表大会，并且第一次同列宁见了面。1923年9月，他和科拉洛夫领导保加利亚人民进行反对法西斯政权的武装起义，不幸失败，从此就亡命国外，直到1945年才在二十二年的流亡之后返回祖国。季米特洛夫一生的革命事业，和保加利亚人民英勇革命斗争的历史是分不开的。他从1904年到1923年将近二十年中间，曾经领导和组织过一千零六十次罢工，由此即可想而知了。
    我在今年6月中旬访问保加利亚时，曾在季米特洛夫七十五岁诞辰纪念（6月18日）的前夜，拜谒了他的墓和访问了他的故居。这次访问在我的心里留下了一个非常深刻的印象：在他的故居里，我们不仅可以感觉到季米特洛夫的伟大，同时也可以看到他那种俭朴和谦虚的崇高品质，是和他的伟大不可分的。当离开他的故居时，我在留言簿上写了这样几句话：“季米特洛夫同志的革命事业永垂不朽！他的光辉的名字将永远活在我们的心中！”（附图片）
    季米特洛夫博物馆前经常不断站立着等候参观的人群。
