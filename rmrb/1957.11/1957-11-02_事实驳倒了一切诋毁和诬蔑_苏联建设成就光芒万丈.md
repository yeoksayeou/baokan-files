Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 1st. The Soviet "Komsomolskaya Pravda" recently published a full-page spread of pictures and text, using the magnificent achievements of Soviet construction to powerfully refute the slanderous rumors spread by people in capitalist countries at various times against the Soviet Union's doubts and vilifications.

"Komsomolskaya Pravda" said that now Soviet artificial satellites are flying over the skies of all countries. Not long ago, Dornberger, a rocket manufacturing consultant at the American Bell Aircraft Corporation, said: "The Russians do not have the intelligence or the ability to surpass the United States in solving technical problems." However, now the equipment that American scientists plan to use to observe their so-called "Vanguard" satellite will be used to observe the Soviet "Red Star," and the American "Vanguard" has become the "Rearguard."

Everyone knows that American companies have long publicized and boasted about their work in manufacturing jet airliners and intercontinental missiles. However, what people saw in 1956 was the Soviet "Tu-104" flying at an altitude of 10,000 meters. A year later, it was the Soviet Union that succeeded in the test of launching a multi-stage intercontinental ballistic missile. This type of rocket can not only be used for military purposes, but also for peaceful purposes, to study the conditions of the upper atmosphere, becoming the precursor of space rockets.

In 1947, former US President Truman said smugly: "The production of the atomic bomb is the greatest achievement of scientific collaboration in human history. It is doubtful that any place other than the United States could concentrate so many scientists to carry out this kind of scientific collaboration?" In the same year, Groves, the leader of the US atomic bomb production design bureau, also said: "It will take the Soviet Union twenty years to make an atomic bomb." However, in just a short time, the Soviet Union made an atomic bomb in 1949, mastered the secrets of thermonuclear reactions in 1953, built the world's first nuclear power plant in 1954, and on April 11, 1957, the world's largest synchrophasotron, capable of accelerating particles to 10 billion electron volts, was completed and put into operation. The Soviet Union is now building a larger accelerator with an energy of 50 billion electron volts. By 1960, the Soviet Union will also build a number of nuclear power plants with a total power of 2 to 2.5 million kilowatts.

"Komsomolskaya Pravda" went on to say that in 1954, we reclaimed 19 million hectares of wasteland in the vast Siberian and Kazakh wilderness. In January last year, the British "Manchester Guardian" also said: "The Soviet Union cannot fulfill its original task of reclaiming new cultivated land." However, in 1956, we harvested more than 2 billion poods of grain from the 35.9 million hectares of virgin and fallow land reclaimed throughout the country. The area of reclaimed land is equivalent to the territory of several European countries.

In 1922, the British writer Wells said that only people with the richest imagination could imagine the realization of electrification in Russia, saying that Lenin was immersed in an electrical utopian fantasy. However, in 1932, the Soviet Union built the Dnieper Hydroelectric Power Station, then the largest hydroelectric power station in Europe. Now the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Power Station, with a power equivalent to four Dnieper Hydroelectric Power Stations, has also been put into production. The Soviet Union is also building larger hydroelectric power stations on major rivers such as the Angara River and the Yenisei River.

In the forty years of the Soviet state's existence, the Soviet people have built countless factories, mines, canals, hydroelectric power stations, new workers' villages, and cities. Lenin once thought of having 100,000 tractors. Now, not 100,000 but 1,577,000 tractors (converted into 15 horsepower each) are running in the Soviet fields, along with 385,000 combine harvesters and hundreds of thousands of various other combines and machines.

"Komsomolskaya Pravda" emphasized: The entire forty-year history of the Soviet regime is a history of the Soviet people, under the leadership of the Communist Party, advancing along the road of socialist construction and achieving amazing and even mythical achievements. The heroic labor of the Soviet people has completely shattered all slanderous rumors. The ultimate goal of the working people of the whole world will surely be achieved, and a communist society will surely be built!

### 事实驳倒了一切诋毁和诬蔑  苏联建设成就光芒万丈

    事实驳倒了一切诋毁和诬蔑
    苏联建设成就光芒万丈
    新华社莫斯科1日电　苏联“共青团真理报”最近以整版的篇幅，登载大量的图片和文字，用苏联宏伟的建设成就有力地驳斥了资本主义国家人士在各个时期散布的对苏联的怀疑和诬蔑的谰言。
    “共青团真理报”说，现在苏联人造卫星已经在世界各国的上空飞行了。不久前，美国贝尔飞机公司火箭制造顾问多恩伯格还说：“俄国人没有那种聪明才智，也没有可能在解决技术问题方面超过美国。”可是，现在美国科学家打算用来观测自己的所谓“先锋号”卫星的设备却要用来观测苏联这颗“红星”了，美国的“先锋号”变成了“后卫号”。
    大家知道，美国公司早就对他们在制造喷气式客机和洲际导弹方面的工作广为宣传和吹嘘。可是，人们在1956年看到的却是在一万公尺高空上飞行的苏联的“图—一○四”。过了一年，在发射多级洲际弹道火箭的试验方面获得了成功的又是苏联。这种火箭不但可作军用，而且可以用在和平用途上，研究大气高层的情况，成为宇宙火箭的先声。
    1947年，前美国总统杜鲁门曾自鸣得意地说：“生产原子弹是人类历史上科学协作的最伟大成就。值得怀疑的是，除了美国外，还有什么地方能够集中这么多科学家来进行这种科学协作？”同年，美国原子弹生产设计局领导人格罗夫斯也说：“苏联要二十年后才能制成原子弹。”可是，曾几何时，就在1949年苏联便制成了原子弹，1953年掌握了热核反应的秘密，1954年建成了世界第一个原子能发电站，1957年4月11日世界最大的能够把粒子加速到一百亿电子伏特的同步稳相加速器建成并开始运转了。现在苏联正在建造能量达五百亿电子伏特的更大加速器。到1960年，苏联还将建成总功率为二百到二百五十万瓩的一些原子能发电站。
    “共青团真理报”接着说，1954年我们在辽阔无垠的西伯利亚和哈萨克原野上开垦了一千九百万公顷荒地。去年1月英国“曼彻斯特卫报”还说：“苏联不能实现开垦新耕地的原定任务。”然而1956年，我们从全国所开垦的三千五百九十万公顷生荒地和熟荒地上收获了二十多亿普特粮食。开荒的面积相当于好几个欧洲国家的领土。
    1922年的时候，英国作家威尔斯说，只有具有最丰富的幻想力的人才能想像在俄国实现电气化，说列宁沉入了电气乌托邦幻想中。然而在1932年，苏联就建成了当时欧洲最大的水电站——第聂伯水电站，现在功率相当于四个第聂伯水电站的古比雪夫水电站也投入了生产。苏联在安加拉河、叶尼塞河等大河上还在建设更大的水电站。
    在苏维埃国家存在的四十年中，苏联人民建成了无数的工厂、矿井、运河、水电站、新的工人村和城市。列宁当年曾想过要有十万台拖拉机。现在在苏联田野上驰骋的不是十万而是一百五十七万七千台拖拉机（折成十五匹马力一台），同时还有三十八万五千台谷物联合机，几十万台各种各样的其他联合机和机器。
      “共青团真理报”强调说：苏维埃政权整个四十年的历史就是苏联人民在共产党领导下，沿着建设社会主义道路前进而取得惊人的乃至神话般的成就的历史。苏联人民的英雄劳动彻底粉碎了一切的谰言。全世界劳动人民的最终目的必将达到，共产主义社会必将建成！
