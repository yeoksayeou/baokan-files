    Hebei Province Young Pioneers' Small Five-Year Plan Activities Contribution
    "Young Pioneer Reservoir" Built Beside Diaoyutai

    (Our dispatch) The construction of the "Young Pioneer Reservoir" in Hebei Province began on November 3rd in the scenic Diaoyutai area of Xingtang County.

    Not long ago, all the Young Pioneers of Matou Primary School in Zhuoxian County proposed to all the children in the province to use a portion of the income from the "Small Five-Year Plan" to build a Young Pioneer Reservoir. This proposal received strong support from the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League and enthusiastic responses from children throughout the province. Young Pioneers in counties such as Lixian, Changli, Xushui, Zhangbei, Luanxian, Wu'an, Linzhang, and Yanshan actively carried out various Small Five-Year Plan activities. On one Sunday morning, 400 children from Nanzhuang Primary School in Lixian County cut more than 19,000 jin of grass, worth over 100 yuan. The children of the Xushui Normal School Attached Primary School carried manure baskets back and forth to school to collect manure. Since the proposal was made, the Young Pioneers' activities in Matou Primary School, Zhuoxian County, have become even more active. In their spare time, they harvest sunflowers and Chinese cabbage, and collect more than a dozen kinds of medicinal materials, such as cicada shells, tangerine peels, and plantain seeds.

    The Young Pioneer Reservoir is expected to be completed before the flood season next year. The earth dam of the reservoir is 22 meters high and can store more than 21 million cubic meters of water. After the reservoir is completed, it can guarantee that 30,000 mu of land downstream of the Qu River will be protected from flooding, and it can also solve the irrigation problem for 80,000 mu of land. A hydroelectric power station built using the reservoir's water power can provide lighting for more than 13,000 people. The funds for the reservoir are initially invested by the state on behalf of the children, and will be gradually repaid in the future from the income generated by the Small Five-Year Plan activities carried out by children throughout the province.

    河北省少年儿童小五年计划活动的贡献
    钓鱼台边兴建“红领巾水库”
    本报讯　河北省“红领巾水库”已于11月3日在风景优美的行唐县钓鱼台开工兴建。
    不久以前，由涿县码头小学的全体少先队员们向全省小朋友提出倡议，用“小五年计划”收入的一部分钱修建一座红领巾水库。这个倡议得到了共青团河北省委的大力支持，也得到了全省少年儿童的热烈响应。蠡县、昌黎、徐水、张北、滦县、武安、临漳、盐山等县的少先队员都积极开展了多种多样的小五年计划活动。蠡县南庄完小在一个星期日上午，四百名儿童就割了一万九千多斤草，价值一百多元。徐水师范附小的儿童们上学时，来回背上粪筐拣粪。涿县码头小学自提出倡议后，少先队的活动更活跃，课余时间收割向日葵、大白菜，还搜集了当地的蝉皮、橘皮、车前子等十几种药材。
    红领巾水库预计明年汛期以前建成。水库的拦土坝高二十二公尺，可蓄水二千一百多万公方。水库建成后，可以保证曲河下游三万亩土地免遭水害，还可解决八万亩土地的灌溉问题。利用水库水力建设的一座水电站，可供一万三千多人的照明。水库的经费先由国家代为投资，将来由全省少年儿童开展小五年计划活动的收入逐步归还。
