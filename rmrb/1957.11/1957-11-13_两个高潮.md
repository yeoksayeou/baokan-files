The Situation After the Blooming and Contending Climax

The entire staff of the Shenyang Mining Machinery Plant began their "big blooming and contending" on September 22nd, and within a few days, a climax of "blooming and contending" was launched. The plant's more than four thousand employees posted more than ten thousand big-character posters and put forward more than twenty thousand opinions. 85% of the employees expressed their opinions, and 65% of the workers spoke their minds. Some workers spoke dozens of times. After a while, the number of speakers decreased, and the number of big-character posters also decreased. Many workers said, "I've already expressed all my opinions." Planning department and design department's "blooming and contending" forums were adjourned halfway because no one was speaking. Now, the majority of employees are waiting for the enterprise to improve its work.

After analyzing the more than twenty thousand opinions put forward by the employees, the Party Committee believed that the "blooming and contending" was broad but not deep, characterized by "three many's and two few's": many speakers, many opinions, and many abstract criticisms; few specific and constructive opinions, and few major issues raised. In terms of improving work, there was plenty of enthusiasm, but not many solutions. The plant solved more than three thousand problems, mostly general and minor issues, such as installing light bulbs, repairing machine tools, and so on. Although the resolution of these minor issues encouraged the enthusiasm of employees for "blooming and contending," the fundamental and major problems within the enterprise had not yet been resolved. Therefore, it was decided to propose special topics based on the major problems in rectification and improvement, to guide employees to conduct in-depth discussions, to thoroughly improve the work.

The topics for discussion were formulated based on the problems revealed by the employees during the "blooming and contending" climax. When formulating the topics, four principles were put forward. First, based on the needs of the enterprise to improve its work, the proposed topics should focus on the major problems within the enterprise. For example, streamlining the organization and improving enterprise management. Second, issues of general concern to the masses. For example, labor insurance benefits and wage treatment. Third, to allow some employees who have not spoken their minds to speak their minds through discussion of major enterprise issues. Fourth, to prepare for the next step of the rectification campaign. Based on these principles, six major topics were formulated: the issue of streamlining the organization, the issue of waste in enterprise management, the issue of wages, labor insurance benefits and cadre policies, the issue of Party-masses relations and the relations between leaders and the led, the issue of market commodity supply, democratic elections and worker-peasant relations, and the issue of the factory director responsibility system under the leadership of the Party committee and the worker representative conference system. In addition to the six major topics for the entire plant, each workshop and department also proposed more specific topics based on the specific situation of their unit. To lead the discussion of major issues in rectification and improvement well, the entire plant established special improvement work groups according to different topics, led by the Party organization and administrative负责人亲自领导.

The Climax of Discussing Rectification and Improvement

The entire plant began to discuss the major issues in rectification and improvement in early October, quickly forming another climax. Employees put forward more than twenty thousand opinions and posted thousands of big-character posters again. The number of employees who expressed their opinions increased to more than 95%. According to the survey, more than 80% of the employees spoke their minds. The content of the discussion was both broad and deep, and the problems raised were both profound and specific. There were negative criticisms, and positive suggestions; sharp exposures, and also solutions to correct shortcomings. This was not quite the same as the "blooming and contending" climax.

In the discussion on streamlining the organization, employees put forward more than two thousand nine hundred opinions, not only exposing the shortcomings of having too many people, but also proposing ways to streamline the organization and transfer personnel. Some employees posted big-character posters, asking: The Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant has revolutionized its organizational structure, why haven't we had a revolution yet? They said: Our plant's management personnel account for more than 27% of the total number of employees; the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant accounted for 17.4% before streamlining the organization, and only 8.5% after streamlining the organization. Compared with others, we are too outrageous! Many workshop workers revealed: The workshop planner works four hours a day, and the labor wage clerk works three hours a day, why can't some be reduced? While exposing these shortcomings, many people also drafted plans for streamlining the organization, drawn into large tables, and posted them. Cadres from the Personnel Section, Wage Section, and Education Section posted big-character posters, saying that the tasks of these three sections are overlapping and need to be merged. According to their opinions, after the merger of these three sections, the forty-one management personnel can be reduced to fifteen. Qi Shao, Ying Guocheng and other five people specifically investigated the production situation of the second and third workshops, and proposed a plan to merge the second and third workshops, reducing management personnel by 60%. Many cadres also explained, based on their own personal experience, why reducing management personnel can still do a good job. In the discussion on improving enterprise management, employees also put forward thousands of opinions. These opinions exposed the waste phenomenon in enterprise management and put forward many improvement methods. Some veteran workers demanded to revise the work quotas. They said: The work quotas in some workshops are too low, and the workers can exceed the quota without much effort, even exceeding the quota by one hundred percent. Based on their opinions, the factory quickly revised the work quotas for twenty-four products.

Organizing the masses to discuss major issues in the enterprise is actually concentrating the wisdom of the masses to improve the work. The Party Secretary of the Shenyang Mining Machinery Plant said: "We organize the masses to discuss major issues in the enterprise, is to rely on the masses to carry out a major reform from the organizational structure, business and ideology, to run the socialist enterprise well." Now, the whole factory has started to reform the organizational structure. According to the opinions and methods put forward by the masses in the discussion, the factory leadership first preliminarily formulated a plan for the whole factory to streamline the organization, proposing to merge twenty-one sections into thirteen sections, merge eleven workshops into six workshops, and reduce management personnel by 44%. After this plan was formulated, it was organized for employees to discuss, revise and supplement this plan. When studying this plan, each workshop and section put forward many constructive opinions and carried out debates. When discussing the plan, the head of the production planning section believed that the section could not do a good job without thirty-five cadres; the staff and section chiefs disagreed with his view and cited specific examples to prove that only twenty-seven cadres were enough. Finally, the section chief agreed with everyone's opinion. When studying the merger plan of the tool section and the process section, many people disagreed with the merger, because tool production is very complicated and has its independence. Some employees also pointed out: The merger of workshops should be cautious, because the workshop is too large, it is not easy to lead, and it can not reduce much management personnel. Some cadres also believe that the sections that manage production technology work have more complex business and can not reduce too much management personnel. Streamlining the organization requires revolutionary spirit, but also be realistic. After the discussion in the whole factory, the factory leadership revised the original plan for streamlining the organization, changing twenty-one sections into sixteen sections, and changing eleven workshops into eight workshops. This final confirmed plan is the product of the combination of leadership and the masses. In order to adapt to the new situation after the streamlining of the organizational structure, the factory leadership also comprehensively considered the opinions of the masses, and preliminarily formulated a plan to reform enterprise management, intending to thoroughly correct the shortcomings in enterprise management from the three aspects of technical management, planning management and financial management, and improve the business level. Leaders at all levels are also prepared to formulate corresponding specific measures to rectify the ideological style and run the enterprise well.

Solved the Most Difficult Problems

The most difficult problems, as long as the leaders are determined and firmly believe in the majority of the masses, can always be solved. It is relatively easy to formulate a plan for streamlining the organization; to implement this plan, of course, will encounter many difficulties. After the plan was determined, should it be implemented immediately? The comrades of the Shenyang Mining Machinery Plant also had different views. Some people were worried: If the organization is streamlined, personnel will be transferred down, will it cause emotional fluctuations among everyone? Will it hinder the development of the rectification movement? Some people held different views, believing that: Through the big blooming and contending and the special discussion on organizational issues, the masses' awareness has been improved, and they all feel that streamlining the organization is urgently needed. The leadership should seize this opportunity and immediately start to transfer personnel down. Transferring personnel down is doing good things, and the masses will support it. For the sake of prudence, the Party Committee repeatedly investigated the ideological situation of the masses and found that most cadres were willing to be transferred down. Cadres from worker backgrounds have no major difficulties in going down to production. Young cadres from intellectual backgrounds, in response to the call of the Party Central Committee, are also determined to participate in physical labor and transform themselves. These two types of cadres account for more than 60% of the total number of cadres in the plant. Those who have more difficulty participating in production are older, weaker cadres and some female comrades with children. The Party Committee decided to do a good job in ideological work, and also to do a good job in arranging personnel transfer. According to different situations, they are either arranged to go to the workshop as apprentices, or arranged to go to school to study. For business units where female comrades can work, female comrades are arranged as much as possible. After doing these preparatory work, the leadership decided to adopt the method of "automatic registration, leadership approval" to first transfer down the first batch of cadres. The plant originally planned to hold two meetings to mobilize cadres to register for production. However, the meeting of cadres above the section chief and director level had just ended, and the general cadre meeting had not yet been held, and the cadres of the entire plant launched a wave of registration. In less than two days, more than 95% of the cadres in the entire plant registered, some posted big-character posters, some wrote applications, asking to be apprentices, or to go to the countryside. Many cadres repeatedly asked the leaders to approve them to go down to production. Zhang Zhong, a staff member of the Finance Section, and Wu Qirang, a technician, repeatedly asked to be apprentices. They said: "We have been studying for more than ten years, and we came to the factory as soon as we left school. We have not been tempered by physical labor and class struggle. We hope to go down to production this time and transform ourselves well." Zhou Fujun, deputy director of the Second Workshop, also applied to the leadership many times, asking to be allowed to be a worker. Now the whole plant has approved one hundred and seventy-eight cadres to participate in production. These cadres worship veteran workers as masters and are determined to be good workers. Soon, the whole plant will transfer another batch of cadres. The plan for streamlining the organization is being implemented smoothly.

The rectification movement of the Mining Machinery Plant is still deepening, and the entire plant has taken on a new look. In November, the entire plant will, on the basis of the big blooming and contending and the in-depth discussion of major enterprise issues by the masses, effectively improve business work and actively organize a production climax. The Party Committee has already made a decision to complete this year's production plan fifteen days ahead of schedule and save the country one million yuan of wealth.

    两个高潮
    本报记者　陈迹
    鸣放高潮后的局面
    沈阳矿山机器厂全体职工在9月22日开始大鸣大放，不到几天时间就掀起了鸣放高潮。全厂四千多名职工贴出一万多张大字报，提出两万多条意见。85％的职工都发表了意见，65％的工人说出了心里话。有些工人发言达几十次之多。过了不久，发言人数下降了，大字报也减少了。不少工人说：“我有意见都放过了。”计划科、设计科的鸣放座谈会开到中途，因为没人发言，只好散会。现在，广大职工都在等待着企业里改进工作了。
    党委会分析了职工们提出的两万多条意见后，认为鸣放的状况是广而不深，“三多两少”：发言人数多，意见条数多，抽象的批评多；具体的建设性的意见少，重大问题放得少。在改进工作方面，劲头很足，但是办法不多。全厂解决了的三千多个问题，多是些一般性的细小问题，诸如安灯泡，修机床，等等。这些细小问题的解决，虽然鼓舞了职工鸣放的积极性，但是企业内部根本性的重大问题还没有解决。因此，决定根据整改中的重大问题提出专题，引导职工深入讨论，以便彻底地改进工作。
    讨论的专题是根据职工在鸣放高潮中揭露出的问题拟定的。在拟定的时候，提出了四条原则。第一，根据企业改进工作的需要，提出的专题是要着重解决的企业内部的重大问题。例如精略机构、改进企业管理等。第二，群众普遍关心的问题。例如劳保福利和工资待遇等。第三，要让部分没有讲出心里话的职工，通过讨论企业重大问题，讲出心里话。第四，要为整风的下一步做好准备。根据这些原则，拟出六大专题：紧缩机构问题，企业管理中的浪费问题，工资、劳保福利和干部政策问题，党群关系和领导同被领导的关系问题，市场商品供应、民主选举和工农关系问题，党委领导下的厂长负责制和职工代表大会制问题。各车间、科室在全厂六大专题而外，还根据本单位具体情况，提出比较具体的专题。为了领导好对整改中重大问题的讨论，全厂按照不同的专题，成立了专门的改进工作小组，由党组织和行政负责人亲自领导。
    讨论整改的高潮
    全厂在10月上旬开始讨论整改中的重大问题，很快又形成了一个高潮。职工们又提出两万多条意见，贴出几千张大字报。发表意见的职工增加到95％以上。据调查，全厂80％以上的职工都说出了心里话。讨论的内容又广又深，提出的问题又深刻又具体。有反面的批评，又有正面的建议；有尖锐的揭露，也有改正缺点的办法。这是和鸣放高潮不大相同的。
    在关于紧缩机构的讨论中，职工们提出了两千九百多条意见，不但揭露了人员过多的缺点，而且提出了怎样紧缩机构下放人员的办法。有些职工贴出大字报，问道：石景山钢铁厂在组织机构上革了命，为什么我们还不革命呀？他们说：我们厂管理人员占职工总数27％以上；石景山钢铁厂没有紧缩机构以前占17．4％，紧缩机构以后只占8．5％。同人家一比，我们太不像话了！不少车间的工人揭露：车间计划员每天工作四小时，劳动工资员每天工作三小时，为什么不能减少一些呢？在揭发这些缺点的同时，许多人又拟出紧缩机构的方案，划成大型表格，张贴出来。人事科、工资科和教育科的干部们贴出大字报，说这三个科任务重复，需要合并。按照他们的意见，这三个科合并以后，可以把四十一名管理人员减少到十五名。齐绍、营国澄等五人具体调查了二、三车间的生产情况，提出了合并二、三车间的方案，减少管理人员60％。不少干部还根据切身体验，说明了为什么减少管理人员还能做好工作的道理。在关于改进企业管理的讨论中，职工们也提出了成千条意见。这些意见，揭露了企业管理中的浪费现象，并且提出了很多改进的办法。有些老工人要求修改工时定额。他们说：有些车间工时定额过低，工人们不费什么劲，就能超过定额，甚至超过定额百分之一百。根据他们的意见，厂子里很快就修改了二十四种产品的工时定额。
    组织群众讨论企业中的重大问题，实际上就是集中群众智慧来改进工作。沈阳矿山机器厂的党委书记说：“我们组织群众讨论企业中的重大问题，就是要依靠群众，从组织机构上、业务上和思想上进行一次大改革，来办好社会主义企业。”现在，全厂已经着手改革了组织机构。根据群众在讨论中提出的意见和办法，工厂领导方面先初步制订出了全厂紧缩机构的方案，提出要把二十一个科室合并成十三个科室，把十一个车间合并成六个车间，减少管理人员44％。这个方案拟出以后，又组织职工讨论，修正和补充了这个方案。各车间、科室在研究这个方案的时候，又提出不少建设性的意见，并且开展了辩论。生产计划科在讨论方案的时候，科长认为全科没有三十五名干部就做不好工作；科员和股长不同意他的看法，并且举出具体事例，证明只要二十七名干部就够了。最后科长同意了大家的意见。在研究工具科和工艺科合并方案的时候，许多人不同意合并，因为工具生产很复杂，又有其独立性。有些职工还提出：合并车间要慎重，因为车间过大了，不好领导，而且减少不了多少管理人员。有些干部还认为，管理生产技术工作的科室，业务比较复杂，不能过多地减少管理人员。紧缩机构，要有革命精神，又要实事求是。全厂讨论以后，工厂领导方面又修正了原来的紧缩机构方案，把二十一个科室改并成十六个科室，把十一个车间改并成八个车间。这个最后肯定了的方案，是领导与群众相结合的产物。为了适应组织机构紧缩以后的新形势，工厂领导方面又综合群众的意见，初步拟定了改革企业管理的方案，打算从技术管理、计划管理和财务管理等三个方面，来彻底纠正企业管理中的缺点，提高业务水平。各级领导人员也准备订出相应的具体措施，整顿思想作风，来办好企业。
    解决了最难解决的问题
    最难解决的问题，只要领导有决心，坚定地相信群众的多数，总是能够解决的。制订出紧缩机构的方案，还比较容易；要实现这个方案，当然会遇到不少困难。在方案确定以后，要不要马上就实施？沈阳矿山机器厂的同志也有过不同的看法。有人耽心：机构紧缩了，就要下放人员，会不会引起大家的情绪波动？会不会有碍整风运动的开展？有人持着不同的看法，认为：通过大鸣大放和对机构问题的专门讨论，群众觉悟提高，都感到紧缩机构有迫切的必要。领导上要抓住这一时机，立即开始下放人员。下放人员是办好事情，群众是会支持的。党委会为了慎重起见，多次调查了群众的思想状况，发现大多数干部是愿意下放的。工人出身的干部，下去生产，没多大困难。知识分子出身的青年干部，响应党中央的号召，也有决心参加体力劳动，改造自己。这两类干部占全厂干部总数的60％以上，参加生产比较困难的是年纪大、身体弱的干部和一些有子女的女同志。党委会决定，要做好思想工作，同时也要做好人员下放的安排工作。根据不同情况，或者安排到车间当徒工，或者安排到学校去学习。女同志能够工作的业务单位，尽量安排女同志。在做好这些准备工作以后，领导方面决定采用“自动报名，领导批准”的办法，先下放第一批干部。全厂本来要召开两次会议，动员干部报名参加生产。但是，科长、主任以上干部会议刚刚开完，一般干部会议尚未召开，全厂干部就掀起了报名的热潮。不到两天功夫，全厂95％以上的干部都报了名，有的贴大字报，有的写申请书，要求当徒工，或者到农村去。不少干部多次找领导同志，希望批准他们下去生产。财务科职员张忠、技术员吴起勷都一再要求当徒工。他们说：“我们过去读书十几年，出校门就来到工厂，没有受过体力劳动和阶级斗争的锻炼。我们希望这一次下去生产，好好改造自己。”二车间副主任周富君也向领导上申请多次，要求准许他去当工人。现在全厂已经批准一百七十八名干部下去参加生产。这些干部拜老工人为师傅，都决心做个好工人。不久，全厂还要下放一批干部。紧缩机构的方案，正在顺利实施中。
    矿山机器厂的整风运动还在深入开展，全厂面貌已是焕然一新。11月份，全厂要在大鸣大放和群众深入讨论企业重大问题的基础上，切实改进业务工作，积极组织生产高潮。党委会已经做出决定，要提前十五天完成今年的生产计划，并且要为国家多节省一百万元财富。
