The United Nations' Responsibility Has Not Ended
Commentator of this newspaper

On November 1, the United Nations General Assembly concluded its discussion on Syria's complaint. With Syria's consent, the United Nations General Assembly did not adopt any resolution on Syria's complaint. However, at Syria's request, the issue remains on the agenda of the General Assembly.

Syria achieved a moral victory, and the United States suffered a moral defeat, in the outcome of the UNGA discussion on Syria's complaint. Originally, as soon as Syria filed its complaint, the United States wanted to prevent the United Nations General Assembly from discussing it. Subsequently, it attempted to use Saudi Arabia's so-called "mediation" activities and the so-called "mediation" proposals of Canada and seven other countries to create a smokescreen to cover up its responsibility in the Turkish aggression against Syria plot. But the United States did not succeed. In their speeches, representatives of Syria, the Soviet Union, and other peace-loving countries cited various facts, forcefully exposing the U.S. plot to instigate Turkey to invade Syria and the danger of the U.S. preparing to launch a war. This greatly heightened the vigilance of the people of Arab countries and the people of all countries in the world. At the same time, it can be seen from the process of discussing Syria's complaint that Arab countries, socialist countries, and many member states support and sympathize with Syria. This shows that if Syria is subjected to aggression, it will not be isolated.

In order to divert the attention of the people of the world, the United States brazenly slandered the Soviet Union in the discussion of Syria's complaint. It pretended that it had nothing to do with the Turkish aggression conspiracy, insisting that the tension in the Middle East was a "false impression" "created" by the Soviet Union. However, throughout the discussion, neither the United States nor Turkey dared to answer directly the facts exposed by Syria and the Soviet Union and other countries. In particular, when Syria requested that a United Nations commission be sent to the Turkish border for investigation, the United States and Turkey did everything possible to obstruct it. U.S. Representative to the United Nations Lodge even publicly advocated on October 28 that there was "no need to rush this matter." Does this not fully demonstrate the guilty conscience of the United States? The U.S. attempt to instigate Turkey to invade Syria was not only not concealed, but was further exposed.

Therefore, the discussion of Syria's complaint by the United Nations General Assembly is beneficial for people to understand the truth of the situation in the Middle East, and thus also conducive to peace. However, this by no means means that the threat of the United States and Turkey to Syria has been eliminated. On the contrary. The Turkish troops gathered on the Turkish-Syrian border have not retreated. Until recently, Turkish troops have continued to provoke the Syrian border, and Turkish aircraft have continued to violate Syrian airspace. At the same time, NATO forces deliberately held "exercises" near Syrian territory. NATO Commander Norstad even clamored to support Turkey. Under these circumstances, world opinion cannot relax its vigilance against the U.S. aggression plot. As for the United Nations General Assembly, although it has temporarily ended the discussion on Syria's complaint, its responsibility for maintaining the security of Syria and the Middle East is far from over. All peace-loving forces will continue to monitor and stop the aggressive activities of the United States and its followers in the Middle East, and continue to support the heroic struggle of Syria and the Arab countries to safeguard peace and national independence.

    联合国的责任并未结束
    本报评论员
    11月1日，联合国大会结束了关于叙利亚控诉案的讨论。经过叙利亚的同意，联合国大会没有就叙利亚的控诉案通过任何决议。但是，按照叙利亚的意愿，这个问题仍然保留在大会的议程中。
    这次联大讨论叙利亚的控诉案的结果，叙利亚取得了道义上的胜利，美国遭受了道义上的失败。本来，在叙利亚刚一提出它的控诉案的时候，美国就想阻止联合国大会就这个控诉案进行讨论。接着，它又企图利用沙特阿拉伯的所谓“调解”活动以及加拿大等七国的所谓
  “调停”建议，来制造烟幕，掩饰它在土耳其侵略叙利亚的阴谋中所负的责任。但是，美国并没有成功。叙利亚、苏联和其他爱好和平国家的代表在他们的发言中，列举了种种事实，有力地揭露了美国指使土耳其侵犯叙利亚的阴谋和美国准备发动战争的危险性。这就大大地提高了阿拉伯各国人民和世界各国人民的警惕性。同时，从讨论叙利亚控诉案的过程中可以看出，阿拉伯国家、社会主义国家和许多会员国都支持和同情叙利亚。这表明叙利亚如果遭受侵略，它是不会孤立的。
    为了转移世界人民的视线，美国在叙利亚控诉案的讨论中竟放肆地诽谤苏联。它装作它同土耳其侵略阴谋没有什么关系的样子，硬说中东的紧张局势是苏联“制造”出来的“假象”。但是，在整个讨论过程中，不论是美国，不论是土耳其，谁也不敢正面回答叙利亚和苏联等国所揭露的事实。特别是当叙利亚要求派遣联合国委员会到土耳其边境进行调查时，美国和土耳其就百般加以阻挠。美国驻联合国代表洛奇并于10月28日公开出面主张“不必忙于此事”。难道这不充分地表现了美国的做贼心虚吗？美国企图策动土耳其侵略叙利亚的阴谋，不但没有得到掩饰，反而更加暴露了。
    因此，这次联合国大会关于叙利亚控诉案的讨论，对于人们了解中东局势的真相是有好处的，从而也就有利于和平。但是，这决不意味着美国和土耳其对叙利亚的威胁已经消除。事情恰恰相反。土耳其集结在土叙边境的军队并没有撤退。直到最近几天，土耳其军队仍然不断向叙利亚边境挑衅，土耳其飞机仍然不断侵犯叙利亚领空。同时，北大西洋公约组织部队又故意在叙利亚领土附近举行“演习”。北大西洋公约组织司令诺斯塔德竟公然叫嚣要支持土耳其。在这种形势下，世界舆论当然不能放松对美国侵略阴谋的警惕性。至于联合国大会，它虽然暂时结束了关于叙利亚控诉案的讨论，可是它对于维护叙利亚以及中东安全的责任仍远远没有结束。一切和平力量将继续监视和制止美国和它的追随者在中东的侵略活动，并继续支持叙利亚和阿拉伯国家为维护和平和民族独立而进行的英勇斗争。
