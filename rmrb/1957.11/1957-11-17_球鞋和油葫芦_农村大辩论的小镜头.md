Sneakers and Oil Gourds
—A Small Scene from a Rural Debate—
By our reporter Jin Feng

The debate became lively as soon as the topic of grain was mentioned.

Rich middle peasant Wang Qingxiang said: "No matter how much the work is improved, if we aren't allowed to eat our fill, we can't work, and we can't produce grain."

Old middle peasant Wang Yong'an chimed in: "That's right, if the land doesn't produce grain, even the workers and cadres will suffer." He struck a very fair-minded pose.

"Not enough to eat!" "Can't eat our fill!" More than a dozen voices clamored at once, and everyone started arguing.

Militia Captain Wang Xianzhang had to raise his voice and say loudly: "Can't everyone speak one at a time? Let me say something. We aren't rich in food right now, but we have to think about how, after collectivization, we suffered three years of disasters in a row, and the state transported grain from thousands of miles away to help us. This year's harvest isn't bad, but we're not united and haven't done a good job in production."

Wang Qingxiang immediately retorted: "We can't be blamed for not doing a good job in production. The state gives us too little grain, we can't eat our fill, and we can't work well."

"Even if we eat a little less right now, this is a period of transition, and we have to overcome some difficulties," Wang Xianzhang still wanted to persuade him with grand principles.

"Period of transition? Why aren't cadres and workers going through a transition? Why do they eat so much and so well?" Wang Qingxiang didn't back down at all, arguing with every word. Sure enough, the atmosphere in the meeting became heavy, and several people lowered their heads.

At this time, Wang Qingxiang thought he had gained the upper hand in the meeting and became complacent. He said angrily: "Things can't go on like this. We peasants must demand contracts for work and output down to the household!" There was a small commotion in the meeting, and some people said in low voices: "Isn't this going solo?" Wang Qingxiang spoke more and more energetically, gesticulating wildly and spraying saliva as he spoke.

"That's right, it's contracting work and output down to the household. Give each person a few acres of land, and let them work separately. See how much more motivated production will be! No need to line up and assemble, no need to bang gongs and bells. Each person works on their own land, getting up early and working late, hoeing one mu after another, watering it over and over again.
  (Someone in the meeting stood up and said, "That's wrong, you want everyone to disband and go backward," but several people let Wang Qingxiang continue speaking)
  "Then you'll see how much we can eat. Not just thirty catties per person per month, but guaranteed to exceed fifty catties. But what kind of life are we living now?" As he spoke, his voice lowered: "I don't even have money to make a pair of shoes. Look, aren't my toes exposed?" As he spoke, he raised his feet. In the flickering light of the oil lamp, two large toes were indeed visible.

Communist Youth League member Lu Zhili couldn't bear it any longer and stood up and asked loudly: "Didn't you just buy a new pair of sneakers to go somewhere, how can you say you're so poor?"

"Sneakers, oh, oh, there... there is a pair," Wang Qingxiang was startled, his eloquent mouth suddenly stopped working, and he stammered, "That's... that's to wear when going to relatives' houses."

The meeting burst into laughter. "Wearing them to relatives' houses, anyway, you have sneakers," "You have sneakers, and you're still calling yourself poor? Who buys sneakers if they can't eat their fill!" Everyone chimed in, leaving Wang Qingxiang with his head hanging down, speechless.

The next day, everyone was plowing in the fields. During the break, people sat scattered in twos and threes on the edge of the field, some knocking out a pipe of tobacco, others chewing on a blade of grass. The young people couldn't stay still and were playing around, laughing and joking. Suddenly, there was a rumbling sound in the field, followed by a puff of white smoke. People understood that it was the troops stationed nearby doing target practice, and no one panicked.

Lu Xiuhua among the women said with a smile: "Take a look at how good the world is now, huh? Hearing gunfire, everyone is calm and at peace, their hearts don't jump, and their legs don't run. If it were the time of war and chaos in the past..."

Before she could finish speaking, Wang Yong'an, who was sitting next to her, said coldly: "What about that time? Who cares about war and chaos, as long as you can eat your fill. But now there's peace, and you can't even fill your stomach!"

Lu Xiuhua, who was always quick-tongued, retorted at Wang Yong'an's plump, round head: "Oh, you're reciting the poverty sutra too! How many people in your family are starving? Everyone sees how fat each of you is, like oil gourds, and you're still embarrassed to say you can't eat your fill!"

"Oil gourd, hahahaha," "Hahahaha, oil gourd." People couldn't help but burst into laughter when they thought of Wang Yong'an and his two fat sons, who were so shiny and round from eating so well, that they really looked like oil gourds. Some laughed until tears came to their eyes, some laughed and rolled on the ground, some laughed and scolded Xiuhua for being too sharp-tongued, and some praised Xiuhua for coming up with such a good analogy.

Wang Yong'an was both ashamed and annoyed, but he couldn't vent his anger, so he had to call out Lu Xiuhua's nickname:

"Erxia, your mouth is really well-trained, I can't argue with you!"

Wang Xianzhang, fearing that he would lose face, immediately changed the subject: "We can't forget the suffering of the past. In those years of war and chaos, who dared to sleep peacefully at home? At that time," he turned to Wang Yong'an and said, "Didn't you also squat in the cornfield all night long, afraid to go home? Where could you have peacefully engaged in production? We should think about the past, compare it to the present, and we must work hard and do a good job in production, and then we'll have plenty to eat."

"You're right, let's work hard!" Wang Yong'an finally accepted Wang Xianzhang's opinion and answered in this way.

    球鞋和油葫芦
    ——农村大辩论的小镜头——
    本报记者  金凤
    一提到粮食问题，辩论会顿然活跃起来。
    富裕中农王庆祥说：“不管如何改进工作，不叫吃饱，干不了活，打不下粮食。”
    老中农王永安接口就说：“对，地要打不下粮食，连工人、干部都坑了。”他摆出一副十分公正的样子。
    “不够吃”；“吃不饱”，会场上十几个声音嚷嚷成一片，都随着吵开了。
    民兵队长王宪章不得不提高了嗓子，大声说：“大伙一个个慢慢讲好不好？我来说说，眼下咱们是吃得不富裕，可是咱们得想想合作化以后，咱们这里连遭三年灾，国家从好几千里外运粮食来接济咱们。今年年成虽说不赖，可咱们大伙又不齐心，没有把生产搞好。”
    王庆祥马上反驳：“生产搞不好，不能怨咱们。国家给我们粮食太少了，吃不饱，不能好好干活。”
    “就算咱们眼下吃得差点，这是过渡时期，得克服点困难”，王宪章还想用大道理来说服他。
      “过渡时期？干部工人为啥不过渡，他们怎么吃得又多又好？”王庆祥一点也不退让，一口一声的辩驳。果然，会场的空气沉闷起来，好几个人的头在低下来。
    这时，王庆祥以为自己在会场上占了上风，得意起来了，他气愤愤地说：“像这样下去可不行。咱们农民得要求包工包产包到户！”会场上起了小小的骚动，有人低低地在说：“这不是单干了吗”？王庆祥愈说愈上劲，一边指手划脚，一边说得唾沫四溅。
      “对，就是包工包产包到户，一人给几亩地，分开各自干，你看生产该多上劲！也不用排队集合，也不用敲锣打钟，各人地上各人干，起早赶黑也得干，锄了一亩又一亩，浇了一遍又一遍。
  （会场上有人起来说话了，“不对，你这是要大伙散伙走回头路”，可又有几个人让王庆祥讲下去）
  “那时你看能吃多少吧，不光一人一月三十斤，管保五十斤也超过。可如今过的是什么日子哪”，他说着声音又低下来：“连做双鞋的钱都没有哇。你们瞧，这不是露了脚趾头？”说着，他举起他的一双脚。摇晃的油灯光下，果然露出两个大脚趾头。
    共青团员路智立实在忍不住了，站起来大声问：“你不久前不是还买了双新球鞋上哪里去了，怎说得那般穷？”
    “球鞋，哦哦，那……那是有一双”，王庆祥吃了一惊，能说会道的嘴巴忽然不听使唤，结结巴巴起来“那是要上亲戚家去穿的呀。”
    会场上哄的一下笑开了。“上亲戚家穿去，反正是有球鞋呗，”“有球鞋，还叫穷哪，谁家吃不饱还买球鞋！”你一言我一语，说得王庆祥搭拉下脑袋，无话可说了。
              ×××
    第二天，大伙儿在地里耕地。休息的时候，人们三三两两散坐在地头，有的磕一袋烟，有的嚼一根草。年轻人闲不住，嘻嘻哈哈闹着玩。突然，田野里轰隆隆一声，接着出现一股白烟。人们明白这是驻在附近的部队在打靶，没有一个惊慌的。
    妇女中的路秀华笑着说了：“你们看看如今这世道好不好？听到枪响，大家安安生生，心不跳，腿不跑。要是过去兵荒马乱那个时候……”
    话没有说完，坐在一旁的王永安冷冷地开了腔：“那个时候又怎样？管它兵荒马乱不兵荒马乱，能够吃饱肚子。可是如今太平了，肚子也吃不饱了！”
    路秀华一向舌尖嘴快，一听王永安这么说，冲着王永安那肥胖溜圆的脑袋就嚷：“喔呀呀，你也来念穷经啰！你家倒是有几个人饿着啦？谁不看到你家一个个都胖得像油葫芦似的，还好意思说吃不饱！”
    “油葫芦，哈哈哈哈”，“哈哈哈哈，油葫芦”，人们一想起王永安和他那两个吃得油光精亮、的溜滚圆的胖小子，毕真像一个个油葫芦，都忍不住哈哈大笑起来。有的笑的流出了眼泪，有的笑得在地上打滚，有的笑着骂秀华嘴太刁，有的却称赞秀华这比喻想得好。
    王永安又羞又恼，又发作不出来，只好喊着路秀华的小名：
    “二霞，你的嘴真算练出来了，俺算说不过你！”
    王宪章怕他脸上搁不下去，马上转圆说：“咱们不能忘记过去的苦，兵荒马乱那年月，人谁敢在家安生睡觉，那时节，”他转过头来对王永安讲：“你不也是成宿蹲在棒子地里不敢回家过夜，哪里还能安安生生搞生产？咱们想想过去，比比现在，就得好好干，把生产闹好，就吃得宽绰了。”
    “你说得对，咱们好好干吧！”王永安终于接受了王宪章的意见这样回答。
