    How to Observe Artificial Satellites with the Naked Eye
    The two artificial earth satellites launched by the Soviet Union can be seen flying in the sky with the naked eye.
    To see an artificial satellite, it is best to know four things first: 1. Where it is coming from and where it is going; 2. When it will fly over or near the local area; 3. Which part of the sky it will be in; 4. At what height in the sky it will be flying. Knowing these things makes it easier to see the artificial satellite. We can find out the time, azimuth, and altitude of the satellite passing over various cities from newspaper reports and the broadcasts of the first program of the Central People's Broadcasting Station (from 12:00 to 12:15 noon and from 10:30 to 10:45 pm daily), and the second program (from 12:30 to 12:45 noon). Knowing the sequence of times the satellite passes over various cities, and according to the locations of these cities, we can deduce the route and direction of the satellite passing over the local area.
    Here is a simple explanation of how azimuth and altitude are measured in degrees. Draw a circle on the ground and divide it equally into 360 degrees. The due south direction is called zero degrees, due west is ninety degrees, due north is one hundred and eighty degrees, due east is two hundred and seventy degrees, and three hundred and sixty degrees returns to due south, overlapping with zero degrees. Altitude is expressed as follows: from the horizon to the zenith (the sky directly overhead) is a right angle, and this right angle is equally divided into ninety degrees. The altitude of the zenith is ninety degrees, and the altitude of the horizon is zero degrees. Midway between the zenith and the horizon is forty-five degrees.
    If the forecast says that the satellite will pass over Beijing at a certain time, it means that it will pass over Beijing, and the altitude will be relatively high, but it may not necessarily pass over the zenith. If there is no specific information about the satellite's azimuth and altitude in the forecast, it will be difficult for us to watch accurately.
    Artificial satellites can only be seen before sunrise and shortly after sunset. They are also invisible when the sky is cloudy or foggy.

    怎样用肉眼观察人造卫星
    苏联发射的两颗人造地球卫星，人们都可以用肉眼看到它们在天空飞行。
    看人造卫星，最好先知道四件事情：一、它从那里飞来，往那儿飞去；二、什么时候飞过本地或本地附近上空；三、飞在天空那一方；四、飞在什么高度的天空。知道了这些情况，就容易看到人造卫星。关于人造卫星经过各城市上空的时间、方位和高度，我们可以从报纸的报道和中央人民广播电台第一种节目
  （每日中午十二时到十二时一刻和晚上十时半到十时四十五分）、第二种节目
  （中午十二时半到十二时三刻）广播中知道。知道了卫星经过各城市上空的时间的先后，根据各城市所在方位，就可以推算出卫星经过本地的来路和去向。
    这里简单说明一下方位、高度的度数是怎样划分的。在地面上划一个圆圈，把它平分为三百六十度。圆圈的正南方管它叫零度，正西方就是九十度，正北方就是一百八十度，正东方就是二百七十度，三百六十度又回到正南方，和零度重叠。高度是这样表示的：从地平线到天顶（头顶上的天空）是一个直角，把这个直角平分为九十度，天顶的高度就是九十度，地平线的高度就是零度。在天顶和地平线的中间，就是四十五度。
    如果预告消息中说某时卫星经过北京，那就是说它要经过北京上空，高度是比较高的，但不一定经过天顶。如果没有预告卫星出现的具体方位和高度，我们不容易守望得很正确。
    看人造卫星只能在日出以前和日落不久的时候。天空有云或浓雾的时候，也是看不见的。
