Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, November 13th: The Hunan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held an enlarged meeting from October 28th to November 6th, and adopted the draft outline of the Hunan Province's agricultural development plan from 1956 to 1967. The draft proposes that the province's total grain output will reach 24.5 to 25 billion jin next year; in 1962, the grain output will reach 35.9 billion jin, with an average grain yield of 705 jin per mu; in 1967, the grain output will reach 45.4 billion jin, with an average grain yield of 890 jin per mu.

Hunan Province is known as the land of fish and rice and has great potential for agricultural production, but this year the province's total grain output is only 23 billion jin, and the unit area yield is 443.4 jin. To double the grain output in ten years is a very arduous task. In the discussion, everyone believed that if we can work hard to improve water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation, these two major agricultural production increase measures, during the next two five-year plans, this plan can be completed. In terms of water conservancy, it is required that by 1962, the province will have 42.33 million mu of paddy fields with irrigation facilities; of which 19.15 million mu can resist drought for more than 60 days; by 1967, the province will have 46 million mu of paddy fields with irrigation facilities, of which 20 million mu can resist drought for more than 50 days, and 26 million mu can resist drought for more than 70 days, basically eliminating ordinary droughts and floods. Hunan has good conditions for developing green manure, raising pigs, and producing chemical fertilizers. In 1962, it is required that the province's cultivated land should be applied with an average of 250 dan of refined and coarse fertilizer per mu, and in 1967, it will increase to 300 dan.

The meeting discussed how to fully realize this plan. Everyone pointed out that to increase the unit area yield to an average of 890 jin in just ten years, the main decision lies in the work of the next five years, especially to do a good job in next year's production. Everyone requested that immediately after the closing of the meeting, a winter production upsurge should be organized throughout the province. This winter and next spring, more than 797,000 new, expanded, and renovated large and small water conservancy projects should be built, increasing the irrigation area in hilly and mountainous areas by 600,000 mu and improving the irrigation area by 10 million mu; accumulating 8 billion dan of high-quality fertilizer; at the same time, strengthening the management of overwintering crops, striving for a bumper harvest of spring crops, and striving to achieve a total grain output of 24.5 to 25 billion jin next year.

The meeting also studied how to overcome right-leaning conservative thinking, mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses, streamline institutions, send cadres to lower levels, and mobilize non-productive urban populations to participate in agricultural production. It was decided that the province, special zone, and county levels would merge some institutions, send 100,000 cadres to the grassroots level, and to the labor front.

    根据农业发展纲要　结合当地具体情况
    湖南制订农业发展规划
    1967年全省粮食亩产量将提高到八百九十斤
    新华社长沙13日电　中共湖南省委从10月28日到11月6日举行扩大会议，通过了1956年到1967年湖南省农业发展规划纲要草案。这个草案中提出，明年全省粮食产量达到二百四十五——二百五十亿斤；1962年粮食产量达到三百五十九亿斤，每亩平均产粮七百零五斤；1967年粮食产量达到四百五十四亿斤，每亩平均产粮八百九十斤。
    湖南省号称鱼米之乡，农业生产潜力较大，但是今年全省粮食总产量仅二百三十亿斤，单位面积产量四百四十三点四斤，要在十年时间内把粮食产量提高一倍，任务是十分艰巨的。在讨论中，大家认为在今后两个五年计划期间，如能努力搞好兴修水利和积肥这两大农业增产措施，这个规划是可以完成的。水利方面，1962年要求全省有灌溉设施的水田达到四千二百三十三万亩；其中能够抗旱六十天以上的一千九百一十五万亩；1967年要求全省有灌溉设施的水田四千六百万亩，其中能够抗旱五十天以上的二千万亩，抗旱七十天以上的二千六百万亩，基本上消灭普通的水旱灾害。湖南有发展绿肥、养猪和生产化学肥料的好条件。1962年要求全省耕地每亩平均施用精粗肥料二百五十担，1967年增加到三百担。
    会议讨论了如何完满地实现这个规划的问题。大家指出要在短短的十年内把单位面积产量平均提高到八百九十斤，主要决定在今后五年的工作，其中尤其要搞好明年的生产。大家要求会议闭幕后就立即在全省范围内组织冬季生产高潮，要在今冬明春新建、扩建和整修大小水利工程七十九万七千多处，使丘陵区、山区增加灌溉面积六十万亩，改善灌溉面积一千万亩；积优质肥料八十亿担；同时要加强越冬作物的管理，争取小春作物丰收，尽量争取明年粮食总产量达到二百四十五——二百五十亿斤。
    会议还研究了如何克服右倾保守思想、调动群众积极性、紧缩机构、下放干部和动员城镇非生产人口参加农业生产等问题。决定省、专区、县三级合并一些机构、下放十万干部到基层去，到劳动战线上去。
