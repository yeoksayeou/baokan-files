Xinhua News Agency, 26th: After the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party was disseminated across various regions, and with the deepening of the rectification campaign, a surge of cadres being transferred to lower levels has begun to take shape in most parts of the country.

In recent times, the party and government leading organs at the central level and in many provinces, cities, and autonomous regions have held meetings, formulated plans, and adopted various measures to ensure the success of this work. Millions of staff members across the country are concerned about this issue. "Go to the labor front, go to the grassroots, temper yourselves, improve yourselves" is currently one of the most inspiring slogans, and many people have already responded to the Party's call with practical actions. According to recent statistics from twenty-seven provinces, cities, and autonomous regions, excluding the Tibet region, and central government organs, more than 810,000 staff members have already been transferred to lower levels. In the future, even more people across the country will be transferred to the labor front and to the grassroots to undergo training. This is a major measure taken to establish a cadre contingent capable of withstanding risks and fighting for the cause of communism, and it is an unprecedented event.

Among the 810,000 people who have already been transferred, some are intellectual cadres who have not undergone production labor and practical struggle, and who lack grassroots work experience. Others are cadres who are relatively familiar with rural work and grassroots work. There are cadres from administrative organs, as well as cadres from institutions and enterprises. In addition, there are also public service personnel and hired/probationary personnel.

What is the future for the large number of staff members being transferred to lower levels? According to statistics from eighteen provinces and cities, including Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Jilin, Hebei, Heilongjiang, Shandong, Jiangsu, Gansu, Shaanxi, Sichuan, Hunan, Anhui, Shanxi, Fujian, Henan, Hubei, and Zhejiang, among the 575,000 people transferred to lower levels, 300,300 went to the labor front, most of whom are engaged in agricultural production, with a small number engaged in industrial and handicraft production, service industries, and other production activities. Among the remaining people, the majority work at the grassroots level, a small number work in organs above the district level, and a very small number have retired or resigned due to old age or poor health. Various regions have adopted diverse methods for organizing transferred personnel to participate in agricultural production. Some individually return to their hometowns, agricultural cooperatives, or participate in labor locally. Others are collectively transferred to a region or an agricultural cooperative in groups of dozens to participate in production. Still others organize cadres to collectively manage agricultural and sideline production. The first method is more commonly used throughout the country. Beijing mainly adopted the second method. Anhui Province has achieved great success in organizing transferred personnel to manage agricultural and sideline production. The province has organized 10,954 transferred personnel to engage in collective production, including 3,768 engaged in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and fishing, 2,821 engaged in animal breeding, 3,904 engaged in small-scale industry, handicrafts, and processing industries, 429 engaged in service industries, and 32 in other activities. According to incomplete statistics from 375 production units, they raised more than 6,000 pigs, more than 3,000 cattle and sheep, more than 43,000 chickens, ducks, and geese, more than 8,000 rabbits, 86 million fish, and more than 220 boxes (cases) of bees and silkworms. They planted more than 6,000 mu of various crops and vegetables, and more than 40,000 trees and fruit trees. Among the 433 production units organized by transferred cadres in the financial and trade system of Anhui Province, 203 are currently profitable. In addition, Gansu and Guangdong provinces have preliminary plans to organize tens of thousands of transferred personnel to reclaim wasteland in the Hexi Corridor of Gansu and Hainan Island, respectively.

Many other regions have transferred personnel taking the lead in going to the mountains and engaging in construction alongside the people in mountainous areas. Recently, 1,105 cadres from provincial-level organs in Guizhou went to mountainous areas to participate in labor production, including 94 cadres at or above the county level. The vast majority of them were assigned to agricultural cooperatives in mountainous areas as members. Jiangxi Province will invest in reclaiming 200,000 mu of wasteland next year and building 97 state-owned forestry bases. The Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee called on transferred personnel to take the lead in vigorously developing mountainous areas, and this call has been enthusiastically responded to by many party members and cadres. Provinces such as Guangxi, Sichuan, and Fujian all plan to transfer a group of cadres to mountainous areas, and many cadres in provinces such as Henan and Jiangsu have enthusiastically signed up, expressing their willingness to go to the mountains.

So far, although many cadres have not been transferred for long, they have already gained a lot through labor and grassroots work experience. Intellectuals who previously could not distinguish between the five grains and "mistook wheat seedlings for chives" now understand a lot of agricultural knowledge, and some have even learned skills such as digging, sowing, weeding, and fertilizing. The phenomenon of being unable to carry burdens or lift things is changing. From the appearance, the faces of the transferred personnel are tanned and rosy, and calluses have formed on their hands. Their bodies have become stronger, and especially their labor concept has been strengthened, and their ties with the working people have become closer. Many transferred cadres in Gansu Province, upon returning to their hometowns, immediately changed out of their cadre uniforms, took off their shoes, rolled up their trouser legs, and went to work in the fields with the peasants. Many cadres who previously held their noses when they saw manure now compete to carry manure after participating in agricultural production, with some carrying manure baskets while walking and picking up manure along the way. Many transferred cadres not only work with the people but also live together, treating each other as family members.

Before being transferred, cadres in various regions generally underwent meticulous ideological work and organizational work. Many staff members in organs have fully utilized big-character posters to expose the unreasonable phenomena of bloated organizations and overstaffing, put forward specific suggestions for streamlining organizations and transferring cadres, and expressed their determination to be transferred. In addition to big-character posters, some also used various forms such as holding discussion meetings, family meetings, and individual talks to resolve ideological problems. At the same time, the leadership tried its best to help solve various practical difficulties of the transferred personnel. This enabled the transferred personnel to happily embark on new jobs.

The transfer of cadres is a very complex task. Currently, some localities and organs still have some shortcomings in carrying out this work. The in-depth ideological mobilization work is not done enough, and although some have been transferred, their thinking is not clear, and they do not understand the important significance of this large-scale transfer of cadres across the country. Secondly, there are also shortcomings in the unified plan and arrangement, and there are simple and crude phenomena in the specific handling of transferred personnel. This situation requires leaders in various regions to persist in carrying out in-depth ideological work and meticulous organizational work.

    建立一支经得起风险的共产主义干部队伍
    全国下放干部八十万
    新华社26日讯　在各地传达中共八届三中全会的精神以后，随着整风运动的深入开展，下放干部的热潮已在全国绝大部分地区内开始形成。
    最近时期以来，中央和许多省、市、自治区的党政领导机关都举行了会议，制订规划，采取各种措施，保证做好这一工作。全国千百万工作人员都在关心这个问题，“到劳动战线去，到基层去，锻炼自己，提高自己”，这是目前最激动人心的口号之一，许多人已经以实际行动响应了党的号召。据除西藏地区以外的二十七个省、市、自治区和中央机关的最近统计，已经下放的工作人员有八十一万多人，今后全国还将有更多的人下放到劳动战线和基层去锻炼。这是为了建立一支为共产主义事业奋斗的经得起风险的干部队伍而采取的重大措施，是史无前例的事情。
    在已经下放的八十一万多人中，有的是一些没有经过生产劳动和实际斗争锻炼的、没有基层工作经验的知识分子干部，也有一些是比较熟悉农村工作和基层工作的干部；有行政机关的干部，也有事业、企业部门的干部，另外还有公勤人员和雇用、试用人员。
    工作人员大批下放以后的出路怎样呢？据北京、天津、上海、吉林、河北、黑龙江、山东、江苏、甘肃、陕西、四川、湖南、安徽、山西、福建、河南、湖北、浙江十八个省市的统计，在下放的五十七万五千人中，到劳动战线去的有三十万零三千人，其中极大部分是从事农业生产，小部分从事工业和手工业、服务性行业等生产；其余的人中间，大多数在基层工作，少数在区以上机关工作，另外，还有极少数因年老体弱不能工作而退职、退休的。各地组织下放人员参加农业生产的方式是多种多样的。有的是逐个回本乡、本农业社或就地参加劳动；有的是几十人集体下放到一个地区、一个农业社参加生产；有的是组织干部集体经营农副业生产。全国各地采用第一种办法的比较多。北京市主要是采用了第二种办法。安徽省组织下放人员经营农副业生产已经取得很大成绩，全省组织下放人员集体进行生产的有一万零九百五十四人，其中从事农、林、牧、渔业的三千七百六十八人，从事饲养业的二千八百二十一人，从事小型工业、手工业和加工工业的三千九百零四人，从事服务性行业的四百二十九人，其他三十二人。据三百七十五个生产单位的不完全统计，共养猪六千多头，牛、羊三千多头，鸡、鸭、鹅四万三千多只，兔子八千多只，鱼八千六百万尾、蜂、蚕二百二十多箱（盒）；种各种农作物和瓜菜六千多亩，植树和果树四万多株。安徽省财贸系统下放干部组织的四百三十三个生产单位中，目前已有盈余的有二百零三个。另外，甘肃、广东两省都初步计划要组织数万下放人员，分别到甘肃河西走廊和海南岛去大量开垦荒地。
    还有许多地区的下放人员带头上山，和山区人民一道进行建设。贵州省级机关近日有一千一百零五名干部前往山区参加劳动生产，其中有县级以上干部九十四人，他们绝大多数被分配到山区农业社当社员。江西省明年将由国家投资垦荒二十万亩，兴建九十七个国营林业基地，江西省委号召下放的人员带头大力开发山区，这一号召已得到许多党员和干部的热烈响应。广西、四川、福建等省都计划把一批干部下放到山区去，河南、江苏等省许多干部已经热情地报名，表示愿意上山。
    到目前为止，许多干部下放虽然不久，但经过劳动和基层工作的锻炼，已经有了很大的收获。原来是五谷不分、“把麦苗当韭菜”的知识分子，现在已经懂得了不少农业知识，有的并且学会了挖地、播种、锄草、施肥等本领。肩不能挑、手不能提的现象正在改变，从外貌上看去，下放人员的脸孔晒得黑里透红，手上磨起了老茧，他们的身体强壮了，特别是他们的劳动观念增强了，和劳动人民的联系密切了。甘肃省的许多下放干部一回到乡里，便换下干部服，脱掉鞋子，挽起裤腿，和农民一道下地干活。不少干部原来见到粪就掩鼻而过，参加农业生产后，就抢着担粪，有的带着粪筐，一面走路，一面拣粪。许多下放干部不但和人民一起劳动，还生活在一起，相互之间亲如家人。
    各地的干部在下放之前，一般都进行了细致的思想工作和组织工作。许多机关的工作人员都充分运用了大字报来揭露机构臃肿、人浮于事的不合理现象，提出紧缩机构、下放干部的具体建议，并且表明下放的决心。除了大字报以外，有的还运用召开座谈会、家庭会、个别交谈等多种形式来解决思想问题，同时领导上尽可能地帮助解决下放人员的各种具体困难。这样就使下放的人员都愉快地走上了新的工作岗位。
    干部下放是一个非常复杂的工作，目前有的地方和有的机关在进行这个工作时还存在着一些缺点，深入的思想动员工作做得不够，有的虽然下放了，但思想还不大通，并不理解这次全国大批下放干部的重要意义；其次，统一的计划和安排也有不够的地方，在具体处理下放人员时，有简单粗糙的现象。这种情况就要求各地领导者，坚持进行深入的思想工作和细致的组织工作。
