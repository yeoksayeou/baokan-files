    Andreyev's Speech

    Dear Comrades Citizens of Beijing!

    Our Soviet delegation, which has come here from the Soviet Union to visit you, extends warm greetings to you, the workers, students, and all working people of Beijing, on behalf of the entire Soviet people and the working people of Moscow, and sincerely wish you new achievements on the road of socialist construction.

    Our Soviet delegation has been here for three days, and we are pleased that you are celebrating the fortieth anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution on such a large scale. We feel that in these few days, Beijing and the entire People's China have shown the atmosphere of the great October Revolution and the deep friendship with the Soviet people.

    The victory of the socialist revolution in China and some other countries has confirmed the international significance of the October Revolution as stated by the great Lenin. This is the most important achievement of the forty years since the October Revolution.

    No force can stop all mankind from continuing to move towards the path opened up by the great October Revolution.

    Long live the unbreakable and eternal friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people!

    Long live world peace!

    安德烈耶夫的讲话亲爱的北京市民同志们！
    我们从苏联来到你们这里访问的苏联各界代表团，代表全体苏联人民和莫斯科的劳动人民向你们，北京的男女工人、学生和全体劳动人民致以热烈的敬礼，并且衷心地祝你们在社会主义建设的道路上获得新的成就。
    我们苏联代表团来到你们这里已经三天了，我们为你们这样大规模地庆祝伟大的十月社会主义革命四十周年而感到高兴。我们觉得，在这几天里，北京和整个人民中国都显示出伟大十月的气氛和同苏联人民的深厚友谊。
    中国和其他一些国家的社会主义革命的胜利证实了伟大的列宁所说过的十月革命的国际意义。这也就是十月革命后的四十年来最主要的成果。
    没有任何力量能够阻止全体人类继续走向伟大的十月革命所开辟的道路。
    中苏两国人民牢不可破的永恒的友谊万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
