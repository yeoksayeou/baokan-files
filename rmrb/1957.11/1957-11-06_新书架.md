New Bookshelf

　　To commemorate the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution, the People's Publishing House has recently rushed to print a batch of new books. These include "The Great October Socialist Revolution 40th Anniversary - Propaganda Outline jointly drafted by the Propaganda and Agitation Department of the CPSU Central Committee and the Marxist-Leninist Research Institute of the CPSU Central Committee" and "Lenin on the Great October Socialist Revolution," "A History of Sino-Soviet Friendship," "Eternal Friendship - Collection of Articles from Chairman Voroshilov's Visit to China," "The Influence of the October Revolution on the Chinese Revolution," "The Soviet Union," "Ten Days That Shook the World," etc. These books will be sold around the time of the October Revolution anniversary. "The Soviet Union" and "Ten Days That Shook the World" are particularly worth introducing:

      "The Soviet Union"

　　This is a relatively comprehensive and concise popular reader about the Soviet Union, published by the Soviet State Political Literature Publishing House this year, and was collectively written by several well-known scholars. The first chapter, "One-Sixth of the World," is written by Mikhailov, Deputy Doctor of Geography and writer of the Soviet Union; the second chapter, "The Soviet Union is a Country of Working People," is written by Professor Denisov, Doctor of Law of the Soviet Union, and Associate Doctor of Law Yodkovsky; the remaining chapters "Industry," "Agriculture," "People's Living Conditions," and "Soviet Culture" are also written by doctors of economics or history of the Soviet Union. This book uses the latest materials, with many facts, figures and charts, to describe the Soviet Union's natural conditions, new achievements in communist construction, and the material and cultural life of the people, and the writing is relatively vivid.

    "Ten Days That Shook the World"

　　Forty years ago, when the great October Revolution broke out, an American revolutionary writer was in Russia and witnessed the victory of the revolutionary uprising. Based on the materials he collected, he wrote an outstanding work: "Ten Days That Shook the World." Lenin wrote a preface to this book, saying: "I have read John Reed's 'Ten Days That Shook the World' with the greatest interest and constant attention, and I heartily recommend it to the workers of the world. I hope that this book will be printed in millions of copies and translated into various languages, because it gives a correct and extraordinarily vivid description of the events that are of great significance for understanding what the proletarian revolution and the proletarian dictatorship are." Lenin's wife, Krupskaya, also praised the book as "an epic," and said in the preface to the Russian version, "This is a series of vivid scenes, they are so typical, that everyone who participated in the revolution cannot help but recall similar scenes that he has seen with his own eyes."

　　This book has now been collectively translated by more than twenty translators.

    为纪念十月革命四十周年，最近人民出版社也赶印了一批新书。其中有“伟大的十月社会主义革命四十周年——苏共中央宣传鼓动部和苏共中央马克思列宁主义研究院共同拟定的宣传提纲”和“列宁论伟大的十月社会主义革命”，“中苏友谊史”、“永恒的友谊——伏罗希洛夫主席访问中国文集”、“十月革命对中国革命的影响”、“苏联”、“震撼世界的十天”等。这些书都将在十月革命节前后出售。特别值得介绍的是“苏联”和“震撼世界的十天”两书：
      “苏联”
    这是苏联国家政治书籍出版社在今年出版的一本比较全面的、简要的介绍苏联的通俗读物，是由几个著名的学者集体写成的。其中的第一章“世界的六分之一”，作者是苏联地理学副博士、作家米哈伊洛夫；第二章“苏联是劳动人民的国家”，作者是苏联法学博士杰尼索夫教授和法学副博士约德科夫斯基；其余各章“工业”“农业”“人民的生活条件”“苏联的文化”，作者也都是苏联经济学或历史学博士。这本书是用最新的材料，用许许多多的事实、数字和图表，描述了苏联的自然条件、共产主义建设的新成就、人民的物质和文化生活，文字也比较生动。
    “震撼世界的十天”
    四十年前，当伟大的十月革命爆发的时候，有一位美国的革命作家正在俄国，亲眼看到了革命起义的胜利的过程。他根据所收集到的材料写成了一部杰出的作品：“震撼世界的十天”。列宁特为这本书写了一篇序言说：“我以最大的兴趣和始终不懈的注意力读完了约翰·里德所著‘震撼世界的十天’一书，我衷心地把它推荐给全世界的工人们。我希望这本书能被印成千百万册、被译为各种文字，因为它给那些对于理解什么是无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政具有重要意义的事件，作了正确而异常生动的描写。”列宁夫人克鲁普斯卡娅也赞美这本书“是一种史诗”，她在俄文版的序言中说，“这是一连串生动的情景，它们是如此的典型，以致每一个参加过革命的人都不禁要回想起他亲眼看到过的类似的情景。”
    这本书现在已经由二十几个翻译工作者集体翻译了出来。
