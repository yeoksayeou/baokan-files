    Large-scale Winter Irrigation Campaign
    Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Shaanxi, Shandong, Qinghai and other provinces have successively issued calls for the development of winter irrigation work, and emphasized that winter irrigation work should be closely integrated with the current large-scale farmland water conservancy construction movement in various places, cooperate with each other, and vigorously carry out seasonal winter irrigation work.
    According to preliminary statistics from Henan, Shandong, Shaanxi, Qinghai provinces and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, these regions plan to winter irrigate 80 million mu. Among them, Henan requires winter irrigation of 40 million mu of wheat, accounting for approximately 89% of the province's irrigated area as of September this year; Shandong Province's Dayuzhang Yellow River Irrigation Project and other 28 large-scale irrigation areas have currently irrigated 900,000 mu, accounting for approximately 50% of the province's canal irrigation area, of which nearly 100,000 mu is winter wheat winter irrigation. Shaanxi Province will complete the irrigation of more than 7 million mu of winter crops and cotton fields before the ground freezes. The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region started autumn irrigation earlier than in previous years, and by October it had irrigated 4.36 million mu, and is currently racing against time to complete the irrigation task of 7 million mu.

    大规模开展冬灌运动
    据新华社讯　陕西、山东、青海等省已经先后发出关于开展冬灌工作的号召，并且强调冬灌工作要和目前各地大规模兴修农田水利运动紧密结合起来，互相配合，把有季节性的冬灌工作大力作好。
    据河南、山东、陕西、青海四省和内蒙古自治区的初步统计，这些地区计划冬灌八千万亩。其中，河南要求冬灌小麦四千万亩，约占全省截止今年9月份灌溉面积的89％；山东省的打渔张引黄灌溉工程等二十八处大型灌区目前已经灌溉了九十万亩，约占全省渠灌面积的50％，其中冬小麦冬灌近十万亩。陕西省将在大地结冻以前，浇完七百多万亩的冬禾和棉田。内蒙古自治区秋浇比往年提早，到十月份已浇灌四百三十六万亩，目前正在抢时间完成七百万亩的浇灌任务。
