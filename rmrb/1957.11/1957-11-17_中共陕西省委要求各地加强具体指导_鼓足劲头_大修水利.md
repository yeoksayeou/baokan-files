Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an Electric Dispatch: The First Secretary of the CCP Shaanxi Provincial Committee, Zhang Desheng, recently instructed all parts of Shaanxi Province to strengthen specific guidance for the water conservancy construction movement.

The water conservancy construction movement in Shaanxi Province has been fully launched. In late October alone, the province completed the task of expanding the irrigated area by more than 300,000 mu. The enthusiasm of leaders at all levels and the broad masses is constantly rising. However, in some places, leaders have shown conservative ideological sentiments of insufficient enthusiasm and ineffective leadership.

At a telephone conference of the secretaries of the 40 county and city Party committees in the Guanzhong area on the 5th, Zhang Desheng, First Secretary of the CCP Shaanxi Provincial Committee, analyzed the reasons for these problems, believing that they were mainly due to an insufficient understanding of the importance of water conservancy construction, the superiority of cooperation, and the strength of the masses, as well as a lack of understanding of water source conditions.

He said that according to the current progress of the movement, the Provincial Party Committee believes that in addition to continuing to deepen ideological education, strengthening specific guidance for the movement is the key to further deepening the movement. Currently, the following matters should be noted in all localities:

First, special districts, counties, districts, townships, and communes should all have a plan so that leaders have a clear understanding and the masses have goals to strive for. First, a plan for this winter and next spring should be made, and then around the Spring Festival, a plan for five to ten years should be made.

Second, it is necessary to guide all agricultural cooperatives to comprehensively arrange the work for this winter, especially to comprehensively arrange the use of labor. This winter and next spring, in accordance with the principle of taking into account both agriculture and sideline occupations, we should do as much farmland water conservancy and agricultural capital construction as possible, and make appropriate allocation of the labor force of the whole commune. If there is surplus labor, it should be given priority to the construction of farmland water conservancy and other agricultural capital construction. In short, we must strive to carry out as much water conservancy as possible without causing damage to other work.

Third, attention should be paid to the timely organization of experience exchange. In addition to introducing the experiences created by the masses in newspapers, methods such as issuing briefings and circulars, holding meetings of activists, and organizing visits can be adopted. When learning, we must also adapt to local conditions and not copy mechanically.

Fourth, strengthen technical guidance. District and township cadres should learn the techniques of water conservancy construction.

Fifth, cadres, party members, members of the Communist Youth League, and activists should be educated to truly play an exemplary role in the water conservancy construction movement.

In addition, all localities and relevant departments should strengthen collaboration and cooperation, establish an inspection system, and strengthen inspection work. Those areas with insufficient enthusiasm, slow action, slow progress, many problems, and many accidents should be inspected and helped.

### 中共陕西省委要求各地加强具体指导  鼓足劲头  大修水利

    中共陕西省委要求各地加强具体指导
    鼓足劲头  大修水利
    据新华社西安电  中共陕西省委第一书记张德生最近指示陕西省各地要加强对兴修水利运动的具体指导。
    陕西省兴修水利运动已经全面开展。仅10月下旬全省就完成了扩大灌溉面积三十多万亩的任务。各级领导和广大群众的积极性正在不断地高涨。但是也有的地方的领导上表现劲头不足、领导不力的保守思想情绪。
      中共陕西省委员会第一书记张德生在5日召开的关中地区四十个县、市委书记电话会议上，分析了发生这些问题的原因，认为主要是对兴修水利的重要性的认识、对合作化的优越性和群众的力量的估计不足，对水源等情况了解不够。
    他说，根据目前运动进展的情况，省委认为，除了继续不断深入地作好思想教育工作以外，加强对运动的具体指导，是运动进一步深入开展的关键。当前各地对以下几件事应该加以注意。
    第一，专区、县、区、乡、社都要有个规划，使领导心中有数，群众有奋斗目标。首先要作出今冬明春的规划，然后在春节前后，作出五年、十年的规划。
    第二，要指导各个农业社全面安排今冬各项工作，特别是要全面安排劳动力的使用。今冬明春应根据农副业兼顾，尽可能多搞一些农田水利和农业基本建设，把全社的劳动力作适当的分配。如有多余的劳动力，应当优先用于兴修农田水利和其他农业基本建设。总之，既要争取尽可能多地兴修水利，又要不使其他工作受到损失。
    第三，要注意及时组织经验交流。对于群众创造的经验，除了在报纸上介绍外，出简报、通报、召开积极分子会议、组织参观等办法，都可以采用。在学习时也要因地制宜，不要生搬硬套。
    第四，加强技术指导。区乡干部要学习兴修水利的技术。
    第五，要教育干部、党员、团员和积极分子，在兴修水利运动中确实起模范带头作用。
    此外，各地各有关部门要加强协作和配合，建立检查制度，加强检查工作，对那些劲头不足、行动迟缓、进展不快、问题多、事故多的地区，加以检查帮助。
