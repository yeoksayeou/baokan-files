Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, November 14th: The Korean Central News Agency was authorized today to issue a statement regarding recent incidents of the United States and the Lee Seung-man group violating the territorial waters of the Republic's northern region. The statement points out that on November 7th, the United States and the Lee Seung-man group, under the pretext of fishing, dispatched an armed fleet of more than 100 vessels into the sea near Goseong, Gangwon Province in the Republic's northern region, to conduct reconnaissance activities. In addition, they dispatched an armed fleet of more than 40 vessels into the sea near Haegeumgang in the aforementioned area, advancing to within a few hundred meters of the coast.

　　The Republic's Coast Guard repeatedly requested these vessels to withdraw, but the armed vessels instead moved closer to the coast. On the 9th, the Republic's guard ships had no choice but to take measures and conduct an inspection at a location of 38 degrees 44 minutes 5 seconds north latitude and 128 degrees 27 minutes east longitude. At this time, the aforementioned vessels, under the cover of Lee Seung-man's naval coast guard vessels, fled south, and eight of the vessels and their crew members entered the northern seaports of the Republic.

　　The statement said that, however, the Lee Seung-man group distorted the facts, claiming that the Republic "kidnapped" South Korean fishing boats, and slandered the Republic.

　　The statement emphasized that the United States and the Lee Seung-man group have repeatedly and systematically created such incidents of territorial sea violations on the east and west coasts of the Republic's northern region in the past, which is one of their consistent attempts to undermine the armistice agreement and intensify the tense situation in Korea.

　　The statement said that the South Korean vessels that came to the Republic's northern region this time will be dealt with fairly and promptly based on the results of the inspection. If the personnel on these vessels are ordinary fishermen exploited by Lee Seung-man, the Republic will, out of brotherly love, allow them to freely go wherever they wish on their vessels and with their belongings.

### 朝鲜中央通讯社受权发表声明  抗议美李集团侵犯朝鲜领海

    抗议美李集团侵犯朝鲜领海
    新华社平壤14日电　朝鲜中央通讯社今天受权就最近美国和李承晚集团侵犯共和国北部领海的事件发表了一项声明。声明指出，在11月7日，美国和李承晚集团以捕鱼为借口，派出由一百多艘船只组成的武装船队侵入共和国北部江原道高城附近的海面，进行侦察活动。此外还派出由四十多艘船只组成的武装船队侵入上述地区的海金刚附近海面，并且进到距离海岸数百公尺的地方。
    共和国海岸警备队曾经几次要求这批船只撤离，但是这批武装船只反而向海岸靠近。共和国的警备船只在9日不得不采取措施，在北纬三十八度四十四分五秒、东经一百二十八度二十七分的地点进行检查。这时，上述船只在李承晚海军警备厅船只的掩护下向南逃走，其中有八艘船只和船上的船员进入了共和国北部的海港。
    声明说，但是，李承晚集团歪曲事实地说，共和国方面“掳走”南朝鲜的渔船，对共和国方面进行中伤。
    声明强调说，美国和李承晚集团过去就在共和国北部的东西海岸一再有系统地制造这种侵犯领海的事件，这是他们一贯企图破坏停战协定、加剧朝鲜紧张局势的行为之一。
    声明说，对于这次来到共和国北部的南朝鲜船只，将根据检查的结果从速予以公正处理。如果这些船只上的人员是被李承晚所利用的普通渔民，共和国方面将从同胞友爱出发，让他们坐他们的船只和携带他们的物品自由地前往他们愿意去的地方。
