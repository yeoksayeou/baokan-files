    Resolutely Implement the Current Struggle Program of the Communist Movement
    People from All Walks of Life in Jiangsu Province and Nanjing City Read and Discuss the Declaration
    (Our newspaper, Nanjing, November 24th) "The Communist Manifesto declared to humanity that capitalism is bound to die. More than a hundred years later, these two declarations formally announce to humanity that socialism is bound to achieve complete victory throughout the world." This is the initial reaction of people from all walks of life in Jiangsu Province and Nanjing City after reading the declaration of the meeting of representatives of the communist and workers' parties of socialist countries and the peace manifesto of the communist and workers' parties.
    The representatives of the Second Session of the Third Jiangsu Provincial Party Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, which is in preparatory session, unanimously believe that the declaration is the struggle program of the current world communist movement and actively express their determination to fight for the realization of this program.
    University teachers, students, and scientific research workers held informal discussions on the declaration. Sun Shuping, Vice President of Nanjing University, believes that the two declarations have opened a new period in the international communist movement. Lu Yanhao, Deputy Director of the Institute of Paleontology of the Academy of Sciences, said: The peace manifesto speaks from our hearts. For the sake of human survival on Earth, we resolutely support the peace manifesto.
    Local organizations of various democratic parties attach great importance to the two declarations. Ren Chonggao, convener of the Jiangsu Provincial Preparatory Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang and Director of the Provincial Department of Supervision, said: Decades ago, I studied the Communist Manifesto. Today, I read the representative meeting's declaration, and I have truly witnessed the communist cause blossom and bear fruit in the world. Liu Guojun and Zhang Jingli, Deputy Directors of the Provincial Democratic National Construction Association and the Federation of Industry and Commerce, said after reading the declaration that it further strengthened our confidence and determination to break with the capitalist stance, establish a socialist stance, and take the socialist road.
    The members of Zijinshan Agricultural Cooperative in the suburbs of Nanjing City believe that the call to "give the world peace" represents the heartfelt voice of the peasants. They expressed their determination to respond to the call of the declaration and strive to stop the war and defend world peace with practical actions.

    坚决执行当前共产主义运动的斗争纲领
    江苏省和南京市各界人民阅读和座谈宣言
    本报南京24日电　“共产党宣言向人类宣告资本主义必定死亡，一百多年以后的这两个宣言，正式向人类宣告社会主义一定要在全世界取得全胜。”这是江苏省和南京市各界人民在读到社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议宣言和共产党和工人党的和平宣言以后的第一个反映。
    正在开预备会的中共江苏省三届二次党代表大会的代表们，一致认为宣言是当前世界共产主义运动的斗争纲领，积极表示要为这个纲领的实现而奋斗。
    大学教师、学生和科学研究工作者对宣言进行了漫谈。南京大学副校长孙叔平认为两个宣言开辟了国际共产主义运动的新时期。科学院古生物研究所副所长卢衍豪说：和平宣言正道出了我们的心里话，为了人类在地球上的生存，我们坚决拥护和平宣言。
    各民主党派地方组织对两个宣言十分重视。民革江苏省筹委会召集人、省监察厅厅长任崇高说：几十年前我学习了共产党宣言，今天又读了代表会议宣言，真是亲眼看到了共产主义事业在世界上开花结果了。省民建、工商联副主任委员刘国钧、张敬礼等在阅读了宣言以后说，读了宣言，更坚定了我们破资本主义立场、立社会主义立场、走社会主义道路的信心和决心。
    南京市郊区紫金山农业社的社员们认为，“给世界以和平”的呼吁，代表了农民心底的呼声。他们表示要响应宣言的号召，努力以实际行动制止战争，保卫世界和平。
