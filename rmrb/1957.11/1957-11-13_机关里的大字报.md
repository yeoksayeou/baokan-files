Big Character Posters in Government Agencies

    Solving the Problem of Overlapping Agencies
    Administrative Offices of Various Import Companies Can Be Merged
    It is suggested that the Administrative Committee expand its scope of management and incorporate the administrative offices of various import companies, abolish the practice of various import companies taking turns leading the Administrative Committee annually, and change to direct leadership from the ministry. This will not only solve the problem of overlapping agencies, but also save a lot of manpower and material resources.

    After the merger of the administrative offices of various import companies, leading cadres can be reduced by one-sixth, section chiefs and general cadres can be reduced by more than one-third, and service personnel can also be reduced by half. Currently, some companies have vacant dormitories that are not used, while others do not have enough; some companies have furniture stored in warehouses for many years without use, while some units do not have furniture and have to make new ones; when several company managers go to the ministry for meetings, many small cars have to be dispatched. After the merger of the administrative offices, houses, furniture, typewriters, computers, cars, etc. can be uniformly allocated to make up for shortages, and the backlog of materials can be utilized. If company managers go to the same place for meetings at the same time, they can save the gasoline used by four cars. Moreover, the management systems of medical clinics, nurseries, barber shops, housing, canteens, etc. can be unified to avoid entanglements and waste.

    Too Many People, Too Few Tasks, Uneven Workload
    Leadership Does Not Pay Attention and the Problem Has Not Been Solved for a Long Time
    The situation of overstaffing and uneven workload in our bureau is quite serious. For example, the main task of the Statistics Division is to produce monthly and annual reports. When monthly and annual reports are being made, there is work to do, but when they are finished, there is nothing to do. However, when everyone raises opinions, the division chief does not take a serious research attitude, but asks everyone in return: Have you done your job well? He will just shout blindly! It is not that there is no work to do, but that there is a lot of work that has not been done. When comrades ask him what work has not been done, the division chief says, over and over again: Analysis and research have not been carried out! A more specific answer is: Collect the situation of the recovery period in 1950, 1951, and 1952, or compile the statistics of the completion of the first five-year plan. Of course, this work must be done and can solve some of the uneven workload problems, but it is not a fundamental solution to the problem. Because after this work is done, we will be idle again!

    Take Division Chief Fu for example. He himself shouts that he has nothing to do, and reading newspapers has become his main job; but when comrades raise the issue of him having nothing to do, he is unhappy.

    The comrades in the Comprehensive Division are even more idle. Some comrades, because they have no work to do, practice writing calligraphy at work, or go to other divisions to read magazines, and some comrades simply wander around. Division Chief Gong also goes to the bureau chief's office to read the Hong Kong Ta Kung Pao during work hours, and sometimes even sleeps during office hours. Specialist Li also sleeps during office hours.

    In addition, the bureau chief's office now has two clerks in charge of receiving and dispatching: one in charge of receiving and one in charge of dispatching. According to the situation in the bureau, I think one person is enough.

    It is hoped that these situations can be reasonably resolved in this rectification.

    The Guangdong Branch and the Tea Management Office
    Why Has the Merger Issue Been Delayed?
    The merger issue of the Guangdong Branch and the Guangdong Provincial Cooperative Tea Management Office was proposed to the ministry by the Guangdong Provincial Foreign Trade Bureau in February this year, and was again suggested to the ministry in August this year, but it has not been resolved until now, and it seems that it will be delayed until next year. Personally, I believe that if the ministry believes that the merger is reasonable, it is best to determine it in principle before the end of the year, and the specific work can be done next year; if it is considered unreasonable, it can be rejected. Delaying the time for too long will cause opinions below. If the Guangdong Cooperative's organization is merged and the personnel of the Tea Office are dispersed, many new problems will arise when discussing the merger again. From the perspective of foreign trade companies, it is beneficial to resolve this matter as soon as possible. I hope the leadership will pay attention to it.

  Four People Are Enough for the Planning and Statistics Division
    The Planning and Statistics Division currently has nine staff members. Although everyone has some work to do, they are idle for three-quarters of the month, which means that one month's work can be completed in one week. According to the current workload of the Planning and Statistics Division (the same is true if it is merged into other departments), and taking into account the seasonal work characteristics, only four people are needed. My opinion on their specific division of labor is: one person is responsible for planning and statistical systems, infrastructure, labor wages, and planning and statistics; one person is responsible for sea transport import and chartering planning and statistics; one person is responsible for sea transport import arrival planning and statistics; and another person is responsible for sea and land transport export chartering and arrival planning and statistics.

    机关里的大字报
    解决机构重叠现象
    各进口公司行政处可合并
    建议管委会扩大管理范围，把各进口公司的行政处合并过来，取消各进口公司每年轮流领导管委会的办法，改为直接受部领导。这样作不仅能解决机构重叠现象，而且可以节省很多人力物力。
    各进口公司行政处合并后，领导干部可减少六分之一，科长及一般干部可减少三分之一以上，服务员也可减少一半。目前，有的公司的宿舍空闲不用，有的宿舍却不够；有的公司家具存在仓库多年不用，有的单位没有家具却要做新的；几个公司的经理去部里开会，就要开出很多小卧车。行政处合并后，房屋、家具、打字机、计算机、汽车等就能统一调配以多济少，就可以把积压的物资利用起来。公司经理们若同时到一个地方去开会，就能节省四部小汽车用的汽油。不仅如此，医务所、托儿所、理发室、房屋、食堂等管理制度就能统一起来，避免纠缠造成浪费。

    人多事少忙闲不均
    领导不重视长期没解决
    我们局内人浮于事忙闲不均的情况比较严重。比如，统计处的工作主要是搞月报和年报，当做月报和年报时就有事干，做完了就没事干。但当大家提出意见时，处长不是采取认真研究的态度，而是反问大家：你们工作做好了吗？就会瞎叫嚷！不是没有工作做，而是有许多工作没有去做。同志们问他究竟有什么工作还没有去做，处长说来说去不过是：分析研究没有开展！具体一点的答复是：把1950、1951、1952年恢复时期的情况汇集一下，或者把第一个五年计划完成情况统计一下。当然，这些工作是必须做的，也能够解决一些忙闲不均的问题，但总不是解决问题的根本办法。因为这些工作做完了，又闲起来了！
    再拿符处长来说吧，他自己也叫嚷没事干，看报纸成了他的主要工作；可是当同志们对他提出没事干的时候，他就不高兴了。
    综合处的同志更空闲。有的同志因为没有工作可做，上班时就练习写字，或到别的处去看杂志，有的同志就干脆到处逛着玩。龚处长在上班时，也到局长办公室去看香港大公报，有时甚至在办公时间睡觉。李专员在上班时也有睡觉的现象。
    另外，局长办公室，现在有两个收发：一个管收，一个管发。根据局里情况，我看一个人就行了。
    这些情况，希望能在这次整改中获得合理解决。

    广东分公司和茶叶管理处
    合并问题为什么迟迟不解决
    广东分公司与广东省合作社茶叶管理处的合并问题，广东省外贸局今年2月即向部提出，今年8月又再次向部建议，但是到现在还没有解决，看样子要拖到明年去了。我个人认为，如果部里认为合并是合理的，最好年前先在原则上确定，具体工作可以到明年；如果认为合并不合理，可以批驳。拖延时间过久，下面会有意见的。如果广东合作社机构合并，茶叶处人员分散，再谈合并又会多出许多新问题。从外贸公司的角度来看，此事及早解决是有利的。望领导上注意。

  计划统计处四个人就够了
    计划统计处现有工作人员九人，每个人虽说都有点工作，但一个月有四分之三的时间闲着，也就是说，一个月的工作，一个星期就可以完成了。根据当前计统处的工作量（合并到其他部门也同样），并照顾到季节性的工作特点，只需要四个人就可以了。他们的具体分工，我的意见是：一个人负责计划统计制度、基建、劳动工资及计统等工作；一个人负责海运进口和租船计划统计工作；一个人负责海运进口到货计划统计工作；另一个人负责海陆运出口租船、到货计划统计工作。对外贸易部　门腾达
