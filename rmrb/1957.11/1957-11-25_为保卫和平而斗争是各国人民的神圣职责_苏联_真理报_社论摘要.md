Xinhua News Agency, November 24th dispatch: According to TASS reports: Today, the Soviet "Pravda" published an editorial entitled "To Defend Peace Is the Sacred Duty of People of All Countries," stating that the "Peace Manifesto" passed by the representatives of the Communist and Workers' Parties of more than sixty countries is a document of great international significance and will play an important role in the fate of modern humanity.

The editorial continued by saying that the people of all countries have gained painful experience in the two world wars. Neither the knowledge of scientists nor the imagination of poets is needed to determine that the next war—if the people of all countries cannot stop it from breaking out—will exceed all the disasters that mankind has suffered so far. However, ordinary people all over the world hope to live in peace and are increasingly launching movements against the threat of new wars. Mankind could not avoid world wars in the past only because the forces of peace were not strong and united enough. Now, a different situation and a different balance of power have formed in the world. In the history of mankind, the forces of peace have never been so powerful and consolidated.

When talking about these forces of peace, the editorial pointed out that this is a huge socialist world with nearly one billion people, the colonial people awakened by the October Revolution, and all honest working people in capitalist countries.

The editorial said that the Soviet Union is no longer an isolated and helpless country. Shoulder to shoulder with it are the great socialist power, People's China, and other socialist countries in Europe and Asia. The unprecedented development of industry, science and technology in the Soviet Union and other socialist countries is conducive to the cause of peace and is a powerful obstacle to launching wars. Among the colonial people awakened by the October Revolution, some have gotten rid of the shackles of long-term dependency, and some are in the process of getting rid of such shackles; they want to live in peace and firmly support the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. India, Burma, Indonesia, Egypt, Syria and other countries are acting under the banner of these historic principles. They strive to get rid of the serious consequences left over by colonialism and pursue a policy of peace and neutrality. All honest working people in capitalist countries abhor war and know the serious consequences of war from personal painful experience. The strong unity of all these great forces can stop the instigators of new wars.

The editorial continued by saying that, however, the Communists have always faced reality squarely, and they believe that they have a responsibility to remind all good people that the danger of a new world war has not passed. The threat to the cause of peace and the safety of the people comes from the imperialist blocs and from the monopoly capitalist groups, because they can rely on the arms race to obtain mythical profits, regardless of the increasingly heavy burden on the shoulders of the working masses. Precisely because of this, the aggressive groups of imperialist countries, especially the United States, stubbornly refuse the proposals for disarmament, prohibition of nuclear weapons and other measures to stop new wars, and hinder the work of the United Nations. The editorial exposed the conspiracy of the ruling groups of imperialist countries to deceive the people with the clamor of the threat of "world communism."

The editorial concluded by saying that the Communists—the spokesmen for the interests of the working people—resolutely defend peace and call on all those who cherish peace to unite. The "Peace Manifesto" points out that peace can only be maintained if all those who cherish peace work together, raise their vigilance against the conspiracies of the instigators of war, and fully understand that it is their sacred duty to make greater efforts to defend the peace that is still under threat. This call has added new strength to the struggle for peace in the hearts of millions of good people and strengthened the firm confidence in the victory of the just cause of peace and the bright future of mankind.

### 为保卫和平而斗争是各国人民的神圣职责  苏联“真理报”社论摘要

    为保卫和平而斗争是各国人民的神圣职责
    苏联“真理报”社论摘要
    新华社24日讯　据塔斯社报道：苏联“真理报”今天以“为保卫和平而斗争是各国人民的神圣职责”为题发表社论说，六十多个国家的共产党和工人党代表会议通过的“和平宣言”，是一个具有重大的国际意义的文件，它将在现代人类的命运中起重要的作用。
    社论接着说，各国人民在两次世界大战中取得了沉痛的经验。既不需要科学家的知识，也不需要诗人的幻想，就能断定，下一次战争——如果各国人民不能制止它爆发——将会超过人类至今所经受过的一切灾难。但是，全世界的普通人们都希望和平地生活，并且日益广泛地展开了反对新战争威胁的运动。人类在过去所以不能避免世界大战，只是因为和平力量还没有足够雄厚和团结。现在，世界上形成了另一种情况，另一种力量对比。在人类历史上，和平力量从来没有这样的强大和巩固。
    社论在谈到这些和平力量的时候，指出这就是一个拥有近十亿人口的巨大的社会主义世界，就是被十月革命所唤醒的殖民地人民，就是资本主义国家全体正直的劳动人民。
    社论说，苏联已经不再是一个孤立无援的国家了，同它并肩前进的有伟大的社会主义强国——人民中国，还有欧洲、亚洲的其他社会主义国家。苏联和其他社会主义国家工业、科学和技术的空前发展有利于和平事业，是对发动战争的有力障碍。在被十月革命所唤醒的殖民地人民中，有的已经摆脱了长期以来的从属地位的束缚，有的正在摆脱这种束缚；他们要和平地生活，坚决拥护和平共处的五项原则。印度、缅甸、印度尼西亚、埃及、叙利亚和其他国家正在这些历史性原则的旗帜下行动起来。它们力求摆脱殖民主义遗留下来的严重后果，奉行和平和中立的政策。而资本主义国家全体正直的劳动人民都憎恶战争，从切身的沉痛经验中知道战争的严重后果。所有这些巨大力量的强有力的团结就能够制止新战争的挑拨者。
    社论接着说，但是，共产党人一向正视现实，他们认为自己有责任提醒一切善良的人们：新的世界大战的危险并没有过去。对和平事业和人民安全的威胁来自帝国主义集团，来自垄断资本集团，因为它们可以依靠军备竞赛获得神话般的利润，而不顾压在劳动群众肩上的越来越沉重的负担。正因为如此，帝国主义国家首先是美国的侵略集团才这样顽固地拒绝关于裁军、禁止核武器和其他制止新战争的措施的建议，并且牵制联合国的工作。社论揭露了帝国主义国家的统治集团用“世界共产主义”威胁的叫嚣来欺骗人民的阴谋诡计。
    社论最后说，共产党人——劳动人民的利益的表达者——坚决保卫和平，呼吁一切珍视和平的人联合起来。“和平宣言”指出，只有一切珍视和平的人们一致努力，提高对战争挑拨者的阴谋的警惕，并彻底了解到要更加努力保卫还处在威胁之下的和平是自己的神圣职责，和平才能够保持住。这个号召在千百万善良人们的心中增添了为和平而斗争的新力量，增强了对于正义的和平事业的胜利和人类光辉未来的坚强信心。
