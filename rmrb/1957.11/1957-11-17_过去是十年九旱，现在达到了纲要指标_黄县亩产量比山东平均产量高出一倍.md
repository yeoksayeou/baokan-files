Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 16th. Huang County, Shandong Province, has exceeded ahead of schedule the grain yield target stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft). Although the county suffered a severe drought this year, it still achieved a bumper harvest due to the efforts of the people throughout the county, with an average grain yield of 490 jin per mu. Among the county's 347 agricultural cooperatives, 84 had an average grain yield of over 500 jin per mu, 42 over 600 jin, and 18 over 700 jin. The Da Yaojia Agricultural Cooperative in Zhongcun Township, located in the plain area, had an average yield as high as 930 jin per mu.

Huang County's grain yield per unit area is more than double the average unit area yield in Shandong Province. The achievement of this success is mainly due to the full play given to the superiority of collective strength after cooperativization and the active construction of farmland water conservancy. Huang County was originally a place plagued by drought nine years out of ten. In 1944, the county had only more than 33,000 wells, and the irrigated area accounted for only 18%, with an average annual yield of only 221 jin per mu. After the land reform, farmers further constructed water conservancy projects and improved operating techniques on their own land. By 1952, the number of wells in the county had increased to 72,000, the irrigated area had increased to 38%, and the grain yield per mu had increased to 413 jin. This was a great leap forward. At the end of 1955 and the spring of 1956, the people of Huang County, on the basis of realizing cooperativization, launched a movement to transform nature with overwhelming momentum. In just a few months, the county added more than 13,000 wells, and built 80 ponds and reservoirs, bringing the irrigated area to 54.7%. The development of water conservancy provided conditions for technological reform, and the multiple cropping index of arable land in the county reached 167.77%. In addition, Huang County farmers also increased the application of fertilizers, promoted improved varieties, and prevented and controlled pests and diseases. Therefore, Huang County's grain yield in 1955 was 443 jin per mu, and in 1956 it leapt to 588.9 jin, exceeding the national agricultural development program (revised draft) grain production target ahead of schedule. Although Huang County suffered a severe drought this year, its grain yield still reached 490 jin.

In order to further increase grain production, the Huang County Committee of the Communist Party of China has initially planned that by the end of next year, the number of live pigs should be increased to 120,000, and the amount of fertilizer applied per mu will be increased from this year's 4,200 jin to 4,800 jin; from now until the end of next year, the county will build 236 medium and small reservoirs and ponds, repair 5 canals, manage 8,000 Zhashan gullies, and dig 10,000 wells. Through these water conservancy constructions, 140,000 mu of paddy fields will be expanded, and the paddy field area of the county will account for 77.5% of the total arable land area; and through deep plowing, deep turning, sand pressing, and soil replacement, the soil will be improved on a large scale, so that the average yield per mu in the county will reach 707 jin next year.

### 过去是十年九旱，现在达到了纲要指标  黄县亩产量比山东平均产量高出一倍

    过去是十年九旱，现在达到了纲要指标
    黄县亩产量比山东平均产量高出一倍
    新华社济南16日电  山东省黄县提前超过全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）规定的粮食产量指标。今年这个县虽然遭受严重的旱灾，但在全县人民努力下，仍然获得丰收，平均每亩产粮食四百九十斤。全县三百四十七个农业社中，粮食产量平均每亩五百斤以上的有八十四个，六百斤以上的有四十二个，七百斤以上的十八个。处在平原地区的仲村乡大姚家农业社，平均每亩产量高达九百三十斤。
    黄县粮食单位面积产量比山东省平均单位面积产量高达一倍以上，这个成绩的获得，主要是在合作化以后，充分地发挥了集体力量的优越性，积极地兴修农田水利。黄县本来是个十年九旱的地方，1944年，全县只有三万三千多眼水井，水浇面积只占18％，平均每亩年产量只有二百二十一斤。土地改革之后，农民在自己的土地上进一步兴修水利，改进操作技术。1952年，全县水井增加到七万二千眼，水浇田增加到38％，粮田亩产量提高到四百一十三斤。这是一次大跃进。1955年底和1956年春，黄县人民在实现了合作化的基础上，又以排山倒海的声势，掀起了改造自然的运动。在短短的几个月中，全县增加了一万三千多眼水井，新修了八十座塘坝、水库，使水田面积达到了54．7％。水利的发展，为技术改革提供了条件，全县耕地面积复种指数达到了167．77％。黄县农民除此以外，还增施了肥料，推广了优良品种，防治了病虫害。因此，黄县粮食产量在1955年亩产四百四十三斤，到1956年一跃而为五百八十八点九斤，提前超过了全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）粮食生产指标。今年黄县虽遭受严重旱灾，粮食产量仍达四百九十斤。
    为了进一步提高粮食产量，中共黄县县委初步规划，到明年年底，生猪要增加到十二万头，每亩施肥量将由今年的四千二百斤增加到四千八百斤；从现在开始到明年年底，全县要修建中、小型水库、塘坝二百三十六座，修渠五道，闸山沟八千个，打井一万眼，通过这些水利建设，扩大十四万亩水田，全县水田面积将占全县耕地总面积77．5％；并通过深刨、深翻、压沙、换土，大规模地改良土壤，使明年全县平均每亩产量达到七百零七斤。
