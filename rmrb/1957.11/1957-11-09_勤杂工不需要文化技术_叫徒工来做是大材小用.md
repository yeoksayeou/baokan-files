    Janitorial Work Doesn't Require Skills; Using Apprentices is a Waste of Talent
    This year, our factory needs to increase the number of janitorial staff, and the leadership plans to select some from the apprentices to fill these positions. However, have the leaders considered that this would change their nature of work? Janitorial work simply does not require education or skills. Isn't it a waste of talent to have young people with a certain level of education and technical ability do this work?

    勤杂工不需要文化技术  叫徒工来做是大材小用
    今年我厂需要增加一些勤杂人员，领导上便就地取材，打算从徒工中抽出一部分来充任。但是，领导上是否考虑到，这样就会改变了他们的工作性质。勤杂工是根本不需要文化和技术的，让有一定文化水平和技术能力的青年去做，是不是大材小用？
