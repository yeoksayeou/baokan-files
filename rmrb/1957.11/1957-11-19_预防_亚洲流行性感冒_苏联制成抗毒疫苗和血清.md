Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 18th—According to TASS, by the end of this year, the Soviet Union will have cultivated nearly 20 million doses of vaccine against "Asian Influenza" and nearly 2.5 million doses of therapeutic serum.

This vaccine is made from live attenuated virus A2, which is more effective than those made with killed viruses in other countries, so many countries have also started to use it. This vaccine has been sent to France, North Korea, Belgium, Syria, Hungary, Egypt, as well as Dr. Smeder in the United States, Professor Andrews in London, Dr. Peter in Hamburg, and Dr. Van der Molan in the Netherlands.

Anticipating the inevitable occurrence of influenza within the Soviet Union, Soviet scientists began extensive scientific research on this new virus as early as this spring, before the disease first spread in some cities in Central Asia, Siberia, and the Urals. In the autumn, when the morbidity rate increased sharply, Soviet virologists had already identified the new enemy causing the disease—the A2 "Asian Influenza" virus. The Institute of Virology of the Soviet Academy of Medical Sciences and the Moscow Mechnikov Serum and Vaccine Research Institute have both worked on this matter.

    预防“亚洲流行性感冒”
    苏联制成抗毒疫苗和血清
    新华社18日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联到今年年底将培养出将近两千万人份的抗“亚洲流行性感冒”疫苗和将近两百五十万人份的治疗血清。
    这种疫苗由活的弱病毒A二制成，比其他国家用死病毒制成的要更有效，因此许多国家也开始采用。这种疫苗曾经寄往法国、朝鲜、比利时、叙利亚、匈牙利、埃及以及美国斯梅德尔博士、伦敦安德鲁斯教授、汉堡彼特博士、荷兰范德摩兰博士等。
    由于预见到苏联境内不可避免地也会发生流行性感冒，苏联科学家早在今年春天这种疾病第一次在中亚细亚、西伯利亚和乌拉尔一些城市蔓延以前，就对这种新病毒广泛地展开了科学研究工作。秋天，当患病率剧增的时候，苏联病毒学家已经找出了这个引起疾病的新敌人——A二“亚洲流行性感冒”病毒。苏联医学科学院病毒学研究所和莫斯科麦奇尼科夫血清疫苗科学研究所都曾为这件事进行过工作。
