Urban Population Growth in Our Country is Among the Fastest in the World

In recent years, the urban population of our country has increased rapidly. The Soviet Union has only eight or nine cities with a population of over one million, the United States has eleven, while our country has thirteen. Shanghai, the largest city in the country, has exceeded seven million people. Wuhan had only 897,000 people in 1949, but last year it increased to 1.45 million. Xi'an had only 460,000 people in 1949, but reached 1.05 million in 1956. Beijing had only 2.09 million people in 1949, but increased to more than 4 million in 1956. From 1950 to 1956, the newly born population in Beijing alone was more than 695,000. This rate of population growth is rare in the world. If it continues to grow at the current rate, it is estimated that from 1950 to 1960, the children newly born in Beijing alone could create another city with a population of one million.

Why is the growth so fast?

Why is urban population growth so fast?

One reason is that people's living standards have gradually improved since liberation, resulting in more births. According to a survey conducted by Beijing State-owned Cotton Mill No. 1, in the 1,080 days from the start of production at the factory to the end of September this year, more than 1,060 children were registered as born in the factory, an average of one per day. Wuhan had 63,300 births in 1955, and 85,400 in 1956. At the same time, due to the improvement of people's living standards and the development of health services, the mortality rate has been greatly reduced.

Here are the historical population birth and death statistics for Beijing as an example:

Other cities have similar situations to Beijing. Generally speaking, the number of births in our cities is increasing year by year, while the number of deaths is decreasing year by year. Therefore, the net increase in urban population each year is growing very rapidly.

The second reason for the rapid growth of urban population in our country is the rapid development of production and construction, and the corresponding increase in the number of employees. Taking the Wuchang Shipyard as an example, the number of workers at the end of 1956 doubled compared to the beginning of the same year, and now it has increased to twice that of the beginning of 1956. Wuhan Electromechanical Installation Company had only four cadres in April 1956, but by the end of the year, it had increased to more than 900.

The third reason is the large influx of rural population into cities. Some of them come to the city as temporary workers; some visit relatives and friends and stay for a long time without returning to their hometowns; some work as nannies; some are not content with agricultural production and are willing to find work in the city; and some employees have the idea of being "taken care of" by the state, believing that their families lack labor and that they need to send money home every month, so it is better to bring their families from the countryside, because they can apply for subsidies if they have difficulties and will not go hungry. Many enterprises and institutions allow employees to send their children to nurseries from 56 days old until they go to primary school, which is convenient and saves money; some factory employee housing rents and utility bills are too low, and some are even free. These systems make employees feel that it is better for their families to live in the city than in the countryside. As a result, large numbers of family members move into the city. In Nanjing, one factory had so low rent for public housing that 108 of the original 900 employee households living in the suburbs vacated or sublet their original housing and moved into public housing in the city. Beijing State-owned Cotton Mill No. 1 has seen more than 800 family members move in from the countryside in the past year, 200 of whom have no household registration or only temporary household registration. From 1950 to the end of 1956, about 150,000 rural people came to Beijing to find employment, 200,000 dependents were brought in by employees and citizens, and the temporary resident population was often around 150,000.

So many people moving into the city to eat, live, take transportation, go sightseeing, watch plays, watch movies, and buy things... This makes all aspects of urban life even more strained.

Consequence 1: Not Enough Housing

First of all, there is not enough housing. The population of Beijing in 1956 increased by 97% compared to 1949; while the housing area in 1949 was 13.74 million square meters, and in 1956 it was 20.464734 million square meters, an increase of only 49%.

Wuhan had a population of 897,000 in 1949, with a residential area of 3.641246 million square meters; in 1956, the population was 1.452 million, an increase of 61.9%, while the residential area increased by only 22% during the same period. Due to the rapid population growth and slow housing increase, the average living area per person has decreased year by year. In 1949, the average was 4.06 square meters per person, which decreased to 3.06 square meters in 1956.

Housing congestion is even more prominent in Shanghai. In 1949, the urban population of Shanghai was 4.14 million, with a housing area of 23.59 million square meters. In 1956, the population was 5.58 million (excluding floating population), an increase of 34.8% compared to 1949, and the housing area was 26.82 million square meters, an increase of 13.6% compared to 1949. The average living area per person is only 2.97 square meters. In recent years, about 40,000 couples get married in Shanghai every year. Not only is housing crowded now, but it is even more difficult for those who are about to get married to find housing. Some still live in single dormitories after marriage, and some have to live in hotels.

Consequence 2: Tight Commodity Supply

With more people in the city, commodity supply is also affected. In recent years, commodities have not failed to increase, but have increased rapidly. For example, the number of pigs raised in 1949 was 58 million, and in September 1957 it increased to 120 million, and the available fat pigs for consumption increased by one fold compared to 1949; the supply of pork to cities and mining areas increased by 30% compared to 1952, but it is still felt to be insufficient. This can also be seen from the historical consumption levels of several major non-staple foods in some cities (changes in average consumption per person per year). Here are just Shanghai and Beijing as examples:

Some cities often cannot buy eggs, sugar, or vegetables. Large cities such as Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai can only produce 70% of the vegetables they need locally, and commercial departments have to purchase them from other places to meet the needs of urban residents. In the first quarter of this year alone, more than 300 million jin of vegetables were transferred from Guangdong, Shandong, Henan, and Hebei to large cities such as Shanghai, Beijing, Hankou, and Northeast China. These places are all more than 500 kilometers away from Beijing, and the farthest is more than 1,400 kilometers. Vegetables from Guangdong have to travel more than 3,600 li from Zhanjiang to Shenyang. Vegetables transported from distant places are not all fine vegetables, some are common vegetables such as cabbage and green onions that can be produced locally. Transporting southern vegetables to the north allows cold northern cities to eat fresh cucumbers, green beans, and tomatoes in winter, which is a good thing for consumers. However, the country suffers a great loss, which many urban residents do not understand. Except for a small surplus in the transportation of southern vegetables to the north, many vegetables have to be sold at a loss. According to calculations in February this year, cabbage has to lose half of its value, and one jin of green onions loses four or five fen. Beijing lost about one million yuan last year operating the transferred vegetables.

Let's take another look at the difficulties caused by the transportation of southern vegetables to the north. When transporting vegetables by train, each car can hold up to 40,000 jin, and some varieties can only hold 10,000 jin, which wastes half the tonnage. Transporting 300 million jin of vegetables requires more than 10,000 train cars. This not only wastes transportation capacity, but also creates transportation tensions.

The increase in urban consumption population in turn affects the countryside. According to incomplete statistics, since liberation, by June of this year, Beijing has requisitioned a total of 210,000 mu of land. Of these, in addition to more than 15,000 mu of wasteland, the rest are farmland. This is equivalent to a reduction of 195,000 mu of agricultural land. When employees' families and farmers move into the city, the rural labor force will also be reduced. Among the more than 23,800 flatbed workers in Taiyuan, people from the countryside accounted for 53.47% of the total number in the year before last and last year. In Jiyi Township, Qingxu County, Shanxi Province, the entire township has 200 laborers, and 170 people have entered the city to pull flatbeds. This situation not only creates difficulties for agricultural production, but also affects urban-rural relations and worker-peasant relations.

Consequence 3: Increased State Expenditure

The larger the city, the more the state spends. Because large cities have high construction standards, requiring the construction of buildings, sewers, paved asphalt roads, public transportation, and a certain proportion of parks and green spaces. Adding all these together, for every additional person in the city, the state has to spend 794 yuan more for him. Our country's foundation is still very poor, and we need many new factories and mines to fundamentally change our backward economic outlook. If the rate of urban population growth exceeds the rate of economic development, we will have to take some of the money that could have been used to develop production and use it to solve urban living problems such as housing and food. This weakens our country's industrial construction. Therefore, in order to ensure and accelerate the speed of our country's socialist industrialization, it is necessary to control the increase of urban population.

How to Control the Plan?

How can we effectively control the growth of urban population? First, we should practice planned parenthood. Too many children make it difficult to improve living standards and education. Planned parenthood is good for the whole country and for parents. Second, in the future, new industrial and basic construction projects should be appropriately distributed in small and medium-sized cities along railway lines and river lines, close to the countryside; new secondary schools should also be distributed in towns and villages as much as possible, so as to facilitate peasant children to attend school. This is also very beneficial for students to strengthen agricultural production education. Third, some of the current measures to encourage the rural population to flow into cities, such as: employee housing subsidies, half of the medical expenses of employee family members being borne by the public, more cloth and oil coupons, etc., should be appropriately changed. Fourth, it is advocated that male and female comrades, especially female comrades, do more housework. Since liberation, many female comrades have participated in work. After they participate in work, most of the housework, such as taking care of children, washing clothes, sweeping the floor, cooking, etc., is handed over to nannies, so the number of nannies in cities has increased a lot. Taking Beijing as an example, by June of this year, among the temporary residents in the city, there were more than 7,000 nannies. If cadres and employees can do some housework, they can use fewer or no nannies. This will reduce some burden on themselves and the country. (Attached picture)

    必须控制城市人口	孙光
    我国城市人口增长之快
          世界少有
    几年来，我国城市人口增加很快。一百万人口以上的城市，苏联只有八、九个，美国有十一个，我国则有十三个。全国最大的城市——上海，已超过七百万人。武汉市1949年只有八十九万七千多人，去年增加到一百四十五万人。西安市1949年只有四十六万人，1956年达到一百零五万人。北京市1949年只有二百零九万人，1956年就增加到四百多万人。从1950年到1956年，仅北京市新出生的人口就有六十九万五千多人。这种人口增长的速度，在世界上是少有的。如果按照现在人口增长的速度发展下去，预计从1950年到1960年，仅仅北京市新出生的孩子就可以再开辟一个一百万人口的城市。
    为什么增长得这样快？
    为什么城市人口增长这样快？
    一个原因是解放以后人民生活水平逐渐提高，出生的人口多。据北京国棉一厂调查，从这个厂开工生产到今年9月底的一千零八十天中，在工厂登记的出生孩子，就有一千零六十多人，平均一天生一个。武汉市1955年出生了六万三千三百多人，1956年又生八万五千四百多人。同时，由于人民生活水平提高和卫生事业的发展，死亡率大大降低。
    这里举北京市历年人口出生死亡统计为例：
    其他城市的情况同北京类似。总的说来，我国城市每年出生人口是逐年增加的，死亡人口是逐年减少的。因而，城市每年净增的人口增长得十分迅速。
    我国城市人口增长快的第二个原因，是由于生产和建设事业迅速发展，职工人数相应的增加。以武昌造船厂为例，1956年年底工人比同年年初就增加了一倍，到现在已增加到1956年初的两倍。武汉机电安装公司，1956年4月只有四个干部，年底就增加到九百多人。
    第三个原因是大批农村人口流入城市。其中有的进城当临时工；有的探亲访友而长期不回乡；有的当保姆；有的人不安心农业生产，愿意到城里找工作；还有些职工有让国家“包下来”的思想，认为家里缺乏劳动力，每月需要自己往家寄钱，不如把家属从农村接来，反正有困难可以申请补助，饿不着肚子。许多企业和事业机关，职工生了孩子，从五十六天一直到上小学，都可以送托儿所，省事又省钱；有些工厂职工住宅的房租费、水电费太低，有的甚至不收。这些制度都使职工们感到：家属住在城市里比住在农村好。于是大批家属就搬进城里来。南京市有一个厂，就是因为住公家房子房租太低，原住市郊的九百户职工中，就有一百零八户把原来的住房退租或转租，进城来住公家房子。北京国棉一厂最近一年来由农村迁来八百多名家属，其中有二百人没有户口或只有临时户口。从1950年到1956年年底，到北京市就业的农村人口有十五万人左右，职工和市民带来的被抚养人口二十万人，暂时居住人口经常有十五万人左右。
    这么多人搬进城里来，要吃饭，住房、坐车、游览，要看戏、看电影，买东西……于是使城市生活各个方面更加紧张。
    后果之一：房子不够住
    首先房子不够住。北京市1956年的人口比1949年增加97％；而住房面积1949年是一千三百七十四万平方公尺，1956年是二千零四十六万四千七百三十四平方公尺，仅仅增加49％。
    武汉市1949年城区人口八十九万七千余人，住宅居住面积三百六十四万一千二百四十六平方公尺；1956年人口是一百四十五万二千多人，增加61．9％，同期住宅居住面积只增加22％。由于人口增加快，住房增加慢，每人平均居住面积逐年下降。1949年每人平均四点零六平方公尺，1956年下降为三点零六平方公尺。
    住房拥挤，在上海市更为突出。1949年上海市区人口是四百一十四万人，住房面积二千三百五十九万平方公尺，1956年人口为五百五十八万（不包括流动人口），比1949年增加34．8％，住房面积为二千六百八十二万平方公尺，比1949年增加13．6％，平均每人居住面积只有二点九七平方公尺。最近几年来，每年上海约有四万对男女结婚，不只现在住房拥挤，将要结婚的人更难找到房子。有的结了婚还住在单身宿舍，有的只好住旅馆。
  后果之二：商品供应紧张
    城市人多了，也影响到商品供应。这几年，商品不是没有增加，而是增加很快。例如养猪头数，1949年是五千八百万头，1957年9月增加到一亿二千万头，可供消费的肥猪比1949年增加一倍；供应城市和矿区的猪肉，比1952年增加30％，但是仍然感到不足。这从一些城市几种主要副食品历年消费水平（每人每年平均消费量的变化）也可以看出来。这里只举上海和北京为例：
    有的城市经常买不到鸡蛋，买不到糖，买不到蔬菜。北京、天津、上海等大城市，本地出产的蔬菜仅够70％，商业部门为了满足城市居民需要，不得不到外地采购。仅今年第一季度，由广东、山东、河南、河北调到上海、北京、汉口和东北的大城市的蔬菜就有三亿多斤。这几个地方距离北京都在五百公里以上，最远的有一千四百多公里。广东的蔬菜从湛江运到沈阳要走三千六百多里。从远地运来的蔬菜并不都是细菜，有些是当地就能生产的白菜、大葱等大路菜。南菜北运，使寒冷的北方城市在冬季也可以吃到新鲜黄瓜、豆角和西红柿，对消费者来说，这是件好事。但是，国家的损失很大，这是很多城市居民所不了解的。除少数南菜北运稍有盈余以外，很多菜都要赔钱。根据今年2月份的计算，大白菜要赔一半，一斤大葱赔四五分钱。北京市去年经营调入的蔬菜大约赔一百万元左右。
    再看看南菜北运给运输造成的困难吧。用火车运蔬菜，每辆车最多能装四万多斤，有些品种只能装一万多斤，这样在吨位上就浪费一半。运输三亿斤蔬菜就需一万多个车皮。不仅浪费了运输力量，而且制造运输紧张。
    城市消费人口增加，反过来又影响到农村。据不完全统计，解放以来，到今年6月，北京市共征用土地二十一万亩。其中除了一万五千余亩荒滩以外，其余都是农田。这等于减少十九万五千亩农业用地。职工家属和农民进城了，又会减少农村劳动力。太原市二万三千八百多平车工人中，前年和去年由农村来的人占总人数的53．47％。山西清徐县集义乡全乡有二百个劳动力，进城拉平车的有一百七十人。这种情形不仅给农业生产造成困难，而且影响城乡关系和工农关系。
  后果之三：国家开支增多
    城市越大，国家的开支也就越多。因为大城市的建筑标准要求高，要盖楼房，要有上下水道，铺柏油马路，设公共汽车，还要有一定比例的公园和绿化地。把这些都加起来，城市每增加一个人，国家就要为他多花七百九十四元。我们国家的底子还很穷，还需要很多新的工厂矿山，才能从根本上改变落后的经济面貌。如果城市人口增加的速度超过经济发展的速度，就不得不把一些本来可以用来发展生产的钱，拿来解决城市的住和吃等生活方面的问题。这就削弱了我国的工业建设。所以，为了保证和加速我国社会主义工业化的速度，必须控制城市人口的增加。
      怎样控制计划？
    怎样才能有效地控制城市人口的增长呢？一、应该做到有计划的生育。子女过多，提高生活水平有困难，教育也有困难。有计划的生育，对整个国家有好处，对于父母亲也有好处。二、今后新建工业和基本建设项目，应该适当地分布在铁路沿线、河流沿线的中小城市，接近农村；新建的中等学校，也应尽量分布在乡镇和农村，以便利农民子弟走读。这对学生加强农业生产教育也有很大好处。三、对现行的一些鼓励农村人口流入城市的措施，如：职工住房有补贴、职工家属医药费由公家负担一半、布票和油票多领等等，都应当适当改变。四、提倡男女同志，特别是女同志多做一些家务劳动。解放以来，女同志参加工作的很多。她们参加工作以后，把大部分家务劳动、如带孩子、洗衣服、扫地、做饭等等，都交给保姆去做了，所以城市中保姆增加很多。以北京为例，到今年6月城市的暂时居住人口中，当保姆的就有七千多人。如果干部和职工都能做一些家务工作，就可以少用或者不用保姆。这给自己、给国家都会减少一些负担。（附图片）
