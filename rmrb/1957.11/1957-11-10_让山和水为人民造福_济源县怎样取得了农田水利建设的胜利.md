    Make the Mountains and Rivers Benefit the People
    -- How Jiyuan County Achieved Victory in Farmland Water Conservancy Construction
    CCP Jiyuan County Committee
    Jiyuan County, Henan Province, has both mountains and water; the Taihang Mountains stand tall in its north, the Yellow River flows through its south, and the Mang River is also within its borders. The great poet of the Tang Dynasty, Bai Juyi, once wrote the line "Jiyuan's mountains and waters are beautiful." However, due to the long-term destruction by the feudal ruling class, for many years, the mountains and waters here not only did not benefit the people, but instead brought disasters to the people. When Jiyuan was liberated in 1945, except for the deep mountains, the trees in the shallow mountains and hilly areas had been completely cut down and burned, the terraced fields were in disrepair, the dikes and embankments had collapsed, soil erosion was very serious, and water and drought disasters occurred constantly. The pattern of water and drought disasters was: no rain in winter and spring, frequent drought in summer, and more flooding in autumn, followed by drought again. The peasants of this county were once so impoverished that they could not even maintain simple reproduction. Not only in disaster years did people flee famine in large numbers; even in normal years, people mostly lived a life of semi-starvation, as the peasants described it: "Bran in the morning, soup at noon, thin porridge by moonlight at night."
    The Magic Weapon for Harnessing Mountains and Rivers
    However, in an era when the people are the masters, natural disasters cannot be allowed to run rampant. In the struggle against nature, despite setbacks and failures, people finally discovered the magic weapon for governing mountains and rivers. This magic weapon seems very ordinary: it is to rely on the strength of the masses to vigorously build farmland water conservancy (including soil and water conservation).
    In 1952, the leading organs of Jiyuan County began to pay attention to water conservancy work, planting trees and afforesting mountains in mountainous areas, closing mountains for afforestation, and building settling ponds on ridges and slopes; digging drainage rivers in low-lying areas. Because of a lack of experience, more than 10,000 settling ponds failed. In 1953, reservoirs and water cellars were built with a focus on mountainous areas; taking Libazhuang and Huanghuling as the center, afforestation, forest cultivation, and the construction of terraced embankments and other soil and water conservation work were carried out in mountainous areas; in low-lying areas, ditches and terraced fields were repaired, and large flood rivers were dug. Through such practice, the county party committee initially realized the importance of water conservancy construction and soil and water conservation work. After the high tide of advanced cooperativization arrived in the winter of 1955, especially after the promulgation of the National Agricultural Development Program (Draft), Jiyuan County formulated a comprehensive plan to eliminate drought within five years, eliminate waterlogging within two years, and green the entire territory within seven years. Water conservancy construction committees were established at the county, district, and township levels, headed by leading party and government comrades, to lead the county's peasants in large-scale water conservancy construction. Over the past few years, Jiyuan County has implemented the method of large-scale construction during agricultural slack seasons, small-scale construction during busy seasons, and year-round construction, closely integrating water conservancy construction with agricultural production. During the three periods of winter, spring, and before the autumn harvest, about 30% of the labor force was drawn out for concentrated attacks, and professional teams were organized during busy farming seasons to strengthen care.
    Water conservancy construction and soil and water conservation work were carried out with a variety of measures tailored to the specific conditions of different regions.
    In mountainous areas, agricultural infrastructure construction focusing on soil and water conservation was carried out. There are four main measures. The first is terracing sloping land. The first step is to focus on repairing terraced embankments and terraced fields. In recent years, 80,000 terraced embankments have been repaired, so that terraced fields are common in mountainous areas. Good terraced fields have a high water storage capacity. The second is to build soil bags (soil ridge roads) in the terraced fields, build waterways at the ends of the fields, and build stone water scoops to store water section by section, silt up the land and conserve moisture, which not only increases soil fertility but also protects the terraced fields. At the same time, mountain-encircling ditches are dug along the slopes of barren mountains to prevent floods from overflowing. The third is to plant crops with soil and water conservation functions such as alfalfa and daylily on the embankments of terraced fields. The fourth is to build ponds and cellars around the terraced fields. 7,300 ponds and water cellars have been built, which have played a significant role in carrying water for spot planting and have also partially solved the difficulty of drinking water for people and animals. The fifth is to change cultivation methods from lengthwise plowing and sowing to crosswise plowing and sowing, from flat planting to ridge planting, and from row sowing to hole planting.
    The second measure is to green barren hills. In the deep mountainous areas, as a result of closing mountains for afforestation, the remaining forests on 717,700 mu of old sites have been restored to life. In the shallow mountainous areas, 110,000 mu of mountains have been closed for afforestation, and 110,536 mu of trees have been planted, which together account for 74% of the afforestable area in the area. On rocky, barren hills with severe weathering, fish-scale pits are dug, small waterways are blocked, and accumulated water and silt are used in the pits for afforestation. In order to solve the contradiction between closing mountains and collecting firewood and grazing, in addition to educating the masses to correctly handle the relationship between immediate interests and long-term interests, and between individual interests and overall interests, the method of "three closures and three non-closures" was also adopted, that is: close young forests but not mature forests; close remote mountains but not nearby mountains; close forest areas but not pastoral areas. At the same time, 600,000 mu of natural pasture with gentle slopes, good grass, and good water conservancy conditions were proactively planned to meet the needs of the masses to develop animal husbandry. On this basis, the masses were mobilized to formulate forest protection and fire prevention covenants, establish forest protection and fire prevention organizations, and stipulate methods for entering the mountains to collect firewood. After repeated education and serious handling of mountain fires, the phenomenon of burning mountains and indiscriminate logging was quickly stopped.
    As a result of greening barren hills, many dry mountain gullies have water all year round, and the muddy water in some mountain gullies has become clear water. According to observation, in the case of 80 mm of daily rainfall, floods still do not go down the mountain; in the case of 100 mm, clear water flows for a long time. The stone crevices and the ground are already covered with a thick layer of weeds, and the soil in nearby cultivated land is improving. The development of forestry and animal husbandry has increased the income of farmers. For example, Libazhuang Township closed mountains for afforestation and planted trees on 60,000 mu in 1949. In 1955, forestry income was more than 21,000 yuan, accounting for 18% of the total agricultural income.
    The third measure is to turn gullies into terraced fields. Combine the treatment of slopes and surfaces with the treatment of gullies. The procedure for treating gullies is: first branch and capillary gullies, then trunk gullies, first upstream, then downstream, build valley dikes and silt dams section by section, and use floods to silt and settle year by year to turn barren gullies into fertile fields. In recent years, a total of more than 12,000 mu of land have been silted up. Build ponds and cellars at the heads of the gullies, cultivate soil ridges, and plant trees to prevent the development of gullies.
    The fourth measure is to build a large number of small reservoirs. In recent years, a total of 100 small reservoirs have been built, which can store more than 10 million cubic meters of water, control a drainage area of 576,300 mu, protect more than 20 villages such as Nanyao, and irrigate more than 80,000 mu of highland. In 1956, 24,000 mu of land were irrigated with reservoir water, increasing the yield by 50 jin per mu. In the upper reaches of the Mang River, a "reservoir group" has been formed, controlling one-third of the Mang River's flood season flow and reducing flooding downstream. Last year, the three reservoirs of Sanhe and others raised 150,000 fish and more than 170 ducks, and it is estimated that they can earn more than 10,000 yuan. Now another 38 reservoirs are planned to raise 500,000 fish. In the lower reaches of the reservoir, old riverbeds and waste land can also be used to grow rice.
    Farmland water conservancy construction in the plains is mainly to open canals and dig wells, make full use of river water and groundwater sources, and expand the irrigated area. As of August this year, the county has opened a total of 914 canals, dug 15 mechanized wells, 1,671 brick wells, and 2,880 earthen wells, and established a machine irrigation station that can irrigate more than 5,000 mu of land. Therefore, the plain area has basically realized water conservancy.
    In low-lying areas, the principle of combining storage and drainage, with storage as the main focus, was implemented, and measures were taken to combine the use of accumulated water with the removal of excess accumulated water. In recent years, with the management of the upper reaches of the Mang River, six large flood rivers have been dug in Xixu, Miaoqi and other places, and more than 240 drainage ditches have been dug. In order to facilitate drainage, the riverbed of the Zhulong River has also been transformed. In the lowest-lying areas, more than 16,000 mu of ditches and terraced fields have been renovated, with gates installed in the ditches to store water for moisture during droughts and appropriately discharge water during floods, and to use the ditches to grow rice, lotus, and raise fish. Now this part can be harvested twice a year. Through the above measures, the threat of waterlogging has been completely eliminated. In the 1956 flood season, the rainfall reached more than 530 mm, and 30 of the 31 communes in the low-lying areas achieved bumper harvests. The historical "Toad Bay" has now become a rice-producing area.
      Four Consecutive Years of Good Harvests
    Because large-scale farmland water conservancy construction has been carried out in mountainous areas, plains, and low-lying areas in Jiyuan County over the past few years, agricultural production has undergone tremendous changes. In 1956, the county's cultivated land area had expanded from 706,336 mu in 1949 to 802,402 mu (excluding the area occupied by reservoirs and other water conservancy projects, the actual cultivated land was 797,788 mu), of which the irrigated land and paddy field area increased from 69,000 mu to 330,000 mu (this is the design area, the actual benefited area is 260,000 mu), with an average of 1.1 mu per rural resident. For slopes, plains, and depressions, 75% of the drainage area has been controlled. Farmland water conservancy construction, coupled with various agricultural technology measures, has enabled the county to achieve four consecutive years of bumper harvests, especially the unprecedented bumper harvest in 1956. The grain yield per unit area (calculated by sown area, the same below) increased from 94 jin in 1949 to 168.4 jin, an increase of 78.9%; the total output increased from 66,387,502 jin to 197,778,710 jin, an increase of 198%; the average per capita social grain ownership increased from 227.4 jin to 698 jin. Animal husbandry has also developed greatly: in 1956, large livestock increased from 32,805 heads in 1949 to 62,750 heads; pigs increased from 7,134 heads to 43,146 heads; sheep increased from 21,534 to 94,947. 91.8% of the agricultural cooperative members in the county increased their income. Collective Wisdom and Efforts, Thriftily Building Water Conservancy
    In the process of water conservancy construction, we adhered to the method of piloting first, making a model, and then gradually promoting it to mobilize the masses. For example, when the first reservoir was built in Nantao in the winter of 1953, the masses had many concerns. After making models, reasoning, calculating pros and cons, organizing visits to other places, and with party members and activists taking the lead, the project was finally completed in the spring of the following year and played a role in flood control and irrigation in the same year. This example educated the cadres and the masses, and the number of reservoirs increased to seven in 1955, 70 in 1956, and now it has reached 100. None of the reservoirs are waste products. The enthusiasm of the masses is also growing.
    Difficulties related to materials, funds, and technical strength are all solved by relying on the strength and wisdom of the masses, and the state only provides necessary subsidies and assistance. For example, the total investment in the 100 small reservoirs that have been built in the county is 830,547 yuan, of which the self-raised portion of the masses accounts for 71%. The state did not provide material subsidies for projects such as digging cellars, digging wells, repairing canals, and afforestation. When each township repaired reservoirs in 1956, there were only three technicians in the county, and only five of the 35 townships had cadres leading water conservancy work. The leadership focused on the Sanhe Reservoir and adopted the method of using the construction site as a school, teaching, learning, and working at the same time to train 98 peasant technicians. Among the 63 newly built reservoirs last year, 56 were built under the leadership of peasant technicians. When construction was generally carried out this spring, there was a shortage of skilled workers in ramming earthen dams. Because 46 old workers (stone ramming workers) were organized to go to various places to provide on-site guidance, more than 3,800 new ramming workers were trained, and the difficulty of insufficient skilled workers was overcome.

    让山和水为人民造福
    ——济源县怎样取得了农田水利建设的胜利
    中共济源县委会
    河南省的济源县有山也有水；太行山耸立在它的北部，黄河流过它的南部，境内还有蟒河。唐朝大诗人白居易曾经写过“济源山水好”的诗句。可是，由于封建统治阶级的长期摧残，多少年来，这里的山和水不但没有给人民造福，反而给人民带来了灾难。1945年济源解放时，除了深山以外，浅山和丘陵区的树木已被砍烧净尽，梯田失修，堤堰倒塌，水土冲刷非常严重，水旱灾害不断发生。水旱灾害的规律是：冬春无雨，夏季常旱，秋季多涝，涝后再旱。这个县的农民曾经贫困到这样的程度，以致连简单的再生产也不能维持。不但在灾年，人民大批逃荒；就是平常年景，人们也多过着半饥半饱的生活，正如农民所形容的：“早上糠，中午汤，晚上稀饭照月亮”。找到了治山治水的法宝
    但是，在人民做了主人的时代，是不能让自然灾害猖獗为害下去的。在同自然作斗争中，尽管有过挫折和失败，但是人们终于摸索到了治理山和水的法宝。这个法宝，说来好像很平常，就是依靠群众的力量大力兴修农田水利（包括水土保持在内）。
    1952年济源县领导机关开始重视水利工作，在山区植树造林，封山育林，在岭坡上打泊池；在低洼地区挖排水河。因为缺乏经验，打的一万多个泊池都失败了。1953年，在山岭地区有重点地修水库，打水窖；以李八庄、黄虎岭为中心，在山区开展造林、育林和修堎垒堰和其他水土保持工作；在低洼地区修整沟洫台田，挖大涝河。经过这样的实践，县委才初步认识到水利建设和水土保持工作的重要性。在1955年冬高级合作化高潮到来之后，特别是在全国农业发展纲要（草案）发布之后，济源县制订了五年内消灭旱灾、二年内解除内涝、七年内绿化全境的全面规划，以党政负责同志为首建立了县、区、乡的水利建设委员会，领导全县农民进行了大规模的水利建设。几年来，济源县实行了农闲大搞、农忙小搞、常年兴修的办法，把水利建设和农业生产密切结合起来，在冬、春、秋收前三个时期，抽出30％左右的劳力进行突击，农忙时组织专业队加强护理。
    水利建设和水土保持工作，是针对不同地区的具体情况采取多种多样的措施进行的。
    在山岭地区，开展了以水土保持为重点的农业基本建设。主要的措施有四项。第一是坡地梯田化。首先是抓住修堎垒堰和整修梯田。几年来修堎垒堰八万道，使山岭地区普遍有了梯田。好的梯田的蓄水能力很高。其次是在梯田内修筑土布袋（土垄道），地头修水道，用石头砌成水簸箕，以节节蓄水，淤地保墒，既增加了土壤肥力，又保护了梯田。同时，在荒山坡边挖围山渠，防止洪水漫流。其三是在梯田的堎堰上种植苜蓿、金针等具有水土保持作用的作物。其四是在梯田周围修塘打窖，现已打了七千三百个池塘和水窖，对担水点种起了显著作用，也部分地解决了人畜吃水的困难。其五是在耕作方法上改顺耕顺播为横耕横播，改平栽为埂栽，改条播为穴种。
    第二项措施是荒山绿化。在深山区，实行封山育林的结果，已经七十一万七千七百亩迹地上的残森恢复生机。在浅山区，封山育林十一万亩，造林十一万零五百三十六亩，这两项共占该区宜林面积的74％。在风化严重的石山秃岭上挖鱼鳞坑，堵小水道，利用坑内积水和淤土造林。为了解决封山和打柴、放牧的矛盾，除了教育群众正确处理眼前利益和长远利益、个人利益和整体利益的关系外，还采取了“三封三不封”的办法，就是：封幼林不封成林；封远山不封近山；封林区不封牧区。同时，主动规划出坡度缓、草好、水利条件好的六十万亩天然牧场，以满足群众发展畜牧业的需要。在这个基础上，发动群众制订护林防火公约，建立护林防火组织，规定入山拾柴办法。经过反复教育和对烧山的严肃处理，很快就制止了烧山和乱伐林木的现象。
    绿化荒山的结果，许多干涸的山沟常年有了水，有些山沟的泥水变成了清水。据观察，在日降雨量八十公厘的情况下，洪水仍不下山；在一百公厘的情况下，也是清水长流。石缝和地面已经铺着很厚的杂草，附近耕地的土壤正在改善。林、牧业的发展，使农民增加了收入。如李八庄乡在1949年封山育林、植树造林六万亩。1955年得到林业收益两万一千多元，占农业总收入的18％。
  第三项措施是沟地川台化。结合治坡治面，同时治沟。治沟的程序是：先支、毛沟后干沟，先上游后下游，节节修筑谷坊、淤地坝，利用洪水逐年淤淀，把荒沟变为良田。几年来共淤地一万二千多亩。在沟头上打塘窖，培土埂，植树造林，防止沟壑发展。
    第四项措施是大量修建小水库。几年来共修建了一百座小型水库，能蓄水一千多万公方，控制了五十七万六千三百亩的流域面积，保护了南姚等二十多个村庄，灌溉了八万多亩高地。1956年用水库的蓄水浇地二万四千亩，每亩增产五十斤。在蟒河上游，已经形成了
  “水库群”，控制了蟒河汛期三分之一的流量，减少了下游的涝灾。去年三合等四个水库养鱼十五万尾，养鸭一百七十多只，预计可收入一万多元。现在又有三十八个水库计划养鱼五十万尾。在水库的下游，还可利用旧河床废地种水稻。
    平原地区的农田水利建设，主要是开渠打井，充分利用河水及地下水源，扩大灌溉面积。到今年8月，全县共开渠道九百一十四条、打机井十五眼、砖井一千六百七十一眼、土井二千八百八十眼，建立了一处能浇地五千多亩的机器灌溉站。因此，平原地区基本上实现了水利化。
  在低洼地区，贯彻执行了蓄泄兼顾、以蓄为主的方针，采取了利用积水和排除多余积水相结合的措施。几年来，随着蟒河上游的治理，在西许、苗启等地挖了六条较大涝河，挖排水沟二百四十多条，为了便于排水，又改造了珠龙河的河道。在最低洼的地区整修沟洫台田一万六千多亩，沟内安上闸门，旱时蓄水保墒，涝时适当排泄，并利用水沟种稻，种藕，养鱼。现在这部分已能一年两熟了。通过以上各种措施，已经彻底解除了内涝的威胁。1956年汛期降雨量达到五百三十多公厘，低洼地区的三十一个社中有三十个社获得丰收。历史上的“蛤蟆湾”，现在变成了米粮川。
      连续四年丰收
    因为几年来在山区、平原地区、低洼地区因地制宜地进行了大规模的农田水利建设，济源县的农业生产已经发生了巨大变化。1956年全县耕地面积已由1949年的七十万六千三百三十六亩扩大到八十万二千四百零二亩（除去水库和其他水利工程的占地面积，实有耕地七十九万七千七百八十八亩），其中，水浇地及水田面积由六万九千亩增加到三十三万亩（这是设计面积，实际受益面积是二十六万亩），每个农村人口平均有一点一亩。对于坡地、平地、洼地，已经控制了75％的流域面积。农田水利建设加上各项农业技术措施，使全县获得连续四年的丰收，特别是1956年获得了空前的大丰收。粮食单位面积产量（按播种面积计算，下同）由1949年的九十四斤增加到一百六十八点四斤，增长了78．9％；总产量由六千六百三十八万七千五百零二斤增长到一亿九千七百七十八万七千一百斤，增长了198％；每人的社会平均占有粮由二百二十七点四斤增加到六百九十八斤。畜牧业也有很大发展：1956年大牲口由1949年的三万二千八百零五头，增加到六万二千七百五十头；生猪由七千一百三十四头增加到四万三千一百四十六头；羊由二万一千五百三十四只增加到九万四千九百四十七只。全县农业社有91．8％的社员增加了收入。群策群力，勤俭办水利
    在水利建设工作过程中，我们坚持了先试点、做出样子，再逐步推广的办法，来发动群众。例如，1953年冬在南洮兴起第一座时，群众顾虑多端。经过做模型，讲道理，算利害，组织到外地参观，由党员和积极分子带头，这项工程终于在第二年春天完成，当年起了拦洪和灌溉作用。这个实例教育了干部和群众，1955年水库就增加到七座，1956年增加到七十座，现在已达一百座。全部水库无一废品。群众的劲头也愈来愈大。
    有关物料、资金以及技术力量等等困难，都依靠群众的力量和智慧来解决，国家只给以必要的补助和帮助。例如全县已建成的一百座小型水库的总投资是八十三万五百四十七元，其中群众自筹部分占71％。对于打窖、打井、修渠、造林等工程，国家没有给予物资上的补助。1956年各乡修水库时，全县只有三名技术员，三十五个乡中只有五个乡有领导水利工作的干部。领导方面就以三合水库为重点，采取以工地为学校、边教边学边作的方法，训练了九十八名农民技术员。去年新建的六十三座水库中，有五十六座是由农民技术员领导修成的。今春普遍施工的时候，土坝打夯技工很缺，由于组织四十六名老硪工（打石夯工人）分赴各地就地指导，培养出新硪工三千八百多人，技工不足的困难被克服了。
