Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 4th: According to TASS, Moscow: "Pravda" published an editorial on the 4th entitled "One After Another".

The editorial said that the news of our country's launch of the second artificial Earth satellite spread all over the world yesterday. People of all countries believe that this is a new and remarkable victory for Soviet science and technology, and a powerful demonstration of the great achievements of the world's first socialist country.

In the fortieth year after the victory of the Great October Socialist Revolution, the development of Soviet science and technology has reached achievements that can be compared with the progress of human knowledge over hundreds of years.

The editorial then listed the brilliant achievements of Soviet scientists in creating the world's largest synchrophasotron, jet aircraft, intercontinental ballistic missiles, and the first artificial satellite. The editorial said that Soviet scientists successfully launched the second artificial Earth satellite with various scientific instruments and experimental animals, thereby expanding the scope of research into cosmic space and the upper atmosphere. The unstudied natural phenomena processes occurring in the universe will now be more easily detected by mankind.

All Soviet people feel a reasonable patriotic pride because the first artificial satellites were manufactured in our country, in our scientific research institutes and design institutions, and in our factories.

The achievements of Soviet science have opened a new era in the development of world science. This achievement is completely in line with the nature of the socialist system itself, which is based on strict scientific principles, and it creates the most favorable conditions for the development of scientific and technological ideas.

The editorial, in discussing the Party's concern for scientific undertakings, quoted the letter from the General Meeting of the Soviet Academy of Sciences celebrating the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The letter stated that when summarizing the development of science under the socialist system over the past forty years, Soviet scientists, together with all the people, feel proud because under the leadership of the Communist Party and the constant guidance of the Leninist Central Committee, our country's science has reached the most advanced position. The Soviet scientific community has fulfilled its duty to the people with its labor. We Soviet scientists know that all our achievements should be attributed to our people and to our dear Communist Party, because the Party has inspired science with a spirit of bold innovation and armed science with a true scientific method—dialectical materialism. The main source of the increasing prosperity of Soviet science is the great inspirational role of the Party.

The editorial said that every Soviet scientist shares the heartfelt sentiments of our outstanding compatriot Tsiolkovsky in his letter to the Party: "I want to dedicate all my work in aviation, rocket flight, and interstellar travel to the true leader of human cultural progress—the Bolshevik Party and the Soviet regime!"

The October Revolution opened up vast and boundless prospects for human progress, enabling science to leap forward and creating a good foundation for the rapid development of science.

The editorial talked about the great significance of the development of Soviet education in promoting the development of science and technology. The editorial pointed out that after the October Revolution, the production experience and scientific and technological experience of Soviet workers and peasants increased immeasurably. Now there are 6.3 million experts in the Soviet national economic sectors who have received higher education and secondary specialized education, while in 1913, there were less than 200,000 such experts. The number of engineers trained in the Soviet Union increased from 36,000 in 1950 to 71,000 in 1956, while the United States decreased from 53,000 to 26,000 in the same period. The widespread development of Soviet science in the various union republics and autonomous republics, and the participation of staff from various design institutions and factory laboratories in scientific activities, are important conditions for the development of Soviet science.

The editorial emphasized that at the time of our country's glorious 40th anniversary, Soviet science has grown strong and is able to solve those most complex problems that not long ago were only bold fantasies. The growth and development of Soviet science is a clear manifestation of the enormous superiority of the socialist system over the capitalist system, the historical victory of the Soviet Union, and the leadership of the Communist Party.

Comrade Mao Zedong talked about this characteristic of Soviet science in his speech upon arriving in Moscow. He said: "In the process of forty years of construction, the Soviet Union has achieved brilliant achievements with extraordinary speed, standing at the forefront of all countries in the world in many aspects, and setting an outstanding example for people who pursue progress and happiness. The launch of the first artificial Earth satellite by the Soviet Union is not a simple event; a new era of mankind's further conquest of nature has begun from this."

Now, not one, but two Soviet Earth satellites are orbiting the Earth. This is a great victory for advanced science.

Now people all over the world, regardless of men, women, old or young, regardless of their profession, no matter where they are, are expressing deep admiration in different languages for the new victory of the Soviet Union, which is confidently marching towards communism.

    一个以后又一个
    苏联“真理报”四日社论摘要
    新华社4日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：“真理报”4日发表了题为“一个以后又一个”的社论。
    社论说，我国发射第二个人造地球卫星的消息昨天传遍了全世界。各国人民认为这是苏联科学和技术新的卓越胜利，是世界上第一个社会主义国家的巨大成就的有力明证。
    在伟大的十月社会主义革命胜利以后的第四十年，苏联的科学和技术的发展达到了能够同整整几百年的人类知识的进步相匹敌的成就。
    社论接着历述了苏联科学家在创制世界最大的同步稳相加速器、喷气式飞机、洲际弹道火箭和第一个人造卫星方面的辉煌成就。社论说，苏联科学家成功地发射了带有各种科学仪器和试验动物的第二个人造地球卫星，从而扩大了研究宇宙空间和大气高层的范围。宇宙中发生的、未经研究的自然现象过程，现在将比较容易为人类所探测了。
    苏联全体人民感到合理的爱国自豪，因为首批人造卫星是在我们国家、我们的科学研究所和设计机构以及我们的工厂内制造出来的。
    苏联科学的成就为世界科学的发展开创了一个新纪元，这种成就是完全合乎规律的。苏联科学的成就决定于社会主义制度本身的性质，社会主义制度是以严格的科学原理为基础的，它为科学技术思想的发展创造了最有利的条件。
    社论在谈到党对科学事业的关怀后引述了苏联科学院庆祝十月革命四十周年全体会议致苏联共产党中央委员会的信。信中说，当总结四十年来社会主义制度下科学发展的时候，苏联科学家同全体人民一起感到自豪，因为在共产党的领导下，在列宁主义的中央委员会经常的指导下，我国科学登上了最先进的地位。苏联科学界以自己的劳动对人民尽职。我们苏联科学家知道，我们全部的成就应归功于自己的人民，归功于自己亲爱的共产党，因为党用大胆革新的精神鼓舞了科学，用真正的科学方法——辩证唯物主义武装了科学。苏联科学日益繁荣的主要源泉是党的伟大的鼓舞作用。
    社论说，每个苏联科学家都对我们杰出的同胞齐奥尔科夫斯基给党的这样一封信抱有衷心的同感：“我要把我在航空、火箭飞行和星际交通方面的全部劳动献给人类文化进步的真正领导者——布尔什维克党和苏维埃政权！”
    十月革命给人类打开了辽阔无垠的进步的远景，使科学得以向前突飞猛进，为科学的神速发展创造了良好的基础。
    社论谈到了苏联教育事业的发展对促进科学技术发展的重大意义。社论指出，在十月革命后，苏联工人和农民的生产经验和科学技术经验不可估量的增加了。现在苏联国民经济部门有六百三十万受过高等教育和中等专业教育的专家，而在1913年，这样的专家还不到二十万。苏联培养出来的工程师从1950年的三万六千人增加到1956年的七万一千人，而美国在同一时期却从五万三千人减少到二万六千人。苏联科学在各加盟共和国和自治共和国的广泛发展以及各设计机构和工厂实验室的工作人员参加科学活动，是苏联科学发展的一个重要条件。
    社论强调说，在我们国家光荣的四十周年到来的时候，苏联科学已经成长强大起来了，它能够解决在不久以前还只是大胆的幻想的那些最复杂的问题。苏联科学的成长和发展是社会主义制度对资本主义制度的巨大的优越性、苏联的历史性胜利和共产党的领导的鲜明体现。
    毛泽东同志在他到达莫斯科时的讲话里谈到了苏维埃科学的这种特征。他说：“在四十年的建设过程中，苏联异常迅速地获得了辉煌的成就，许多方面都站在世界各国的最前列，为追求进步和幸福的人民树立了卓越的榜样。苏联发射第一个人造地球卫星不是一个简单的事件，人类进一步征服自然界的新纪元从此开始了。”
    现在不是一个，而是两个苏联的地球卫星环绕地球运行了，这是先进的科学的巨大胜利。
    现在全世界的人民，不分男女老少，不管什么职业，不论是在天南地北，都纷纷在以不同的语言对充满信心地向共产主义迈进的苏联的新胜利表示深深钦佩。
