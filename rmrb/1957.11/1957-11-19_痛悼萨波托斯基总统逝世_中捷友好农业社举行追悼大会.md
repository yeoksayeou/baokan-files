Xinhua News Agency, 18th: The members of the Sino-Czech Friendship Agricultural Cooperative in Zhangguozhuang Township, a suburb of Beijing, held a memorial service on the 18th, to deeply mourn the death of the President of the Czechoslovak Republic, Antonín Zápotocký. More than 500 people attended the memorial service, including representatives of the local CCP Committee and government, and members of the cooperative. The Counselor of the Czechoslovak Embassy in China, Mr. Bílý, also attended the memorial service.

    Guo Rong, Director of the Sino-Czech Friendship Agricultural Cooperative, led the members in presenting a wreath before the portrait of President Zápotocký. In his eulogy, he expressed the grief of the members. He said that we will transform grief into strength, strengthen the unity between the peoples of China and Czechoslovakia, and do a good job in our current production work.

    The Counselor of the Czechoslovak Embassy in China, Mr. Bílý, reported at the meeting on the life of President Zápotocký's struggle for the rights of the working people. He said that the people of Czechoslovakia will unite more closely around the Communist Party and the government of the Republic in the future, and advance towards the goal that President Zápotocký devoted his life to—socialism and communism.

    The Sino-Czech Friendship Agricultural Cooperative has established friendly relations with the farmers of Vinarice village in Czechoslovakia since 1953. Since then, when delegations from the Czechoslovak Republic visit our country, they have visited this agricultural cooperative. The friendship between the members of this agricultural cooperative and the people of Czechoslovakia has been growing day by day.
