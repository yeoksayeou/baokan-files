Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, November 22nd:

    The large-scale water conservancy construction movement in Hebei Province has entered its climax and achieved remarkable results. To understand the progress and experience of the movement, Xinhua News Agency reporters interviewed the person in charge of the Hebei Provincial Party Committee.

    The person in charge said that currently, a magnificent mass water conservancy construction movement is unfolding universally throughout the province with the force of a massive army, and has already formed a high tide. A few regions that were acting more slowly have also caught up by leaps and bounds. Statistics up to mid-November show that more than 4.9 million male and female farmers throughout the province have been投入 into the water conservancy construction movement. The province has dug more than 143,000 various water wells, repaired more than 115,000 old wells, drilled 721 machine wells, opened 8,496 new canals, repaired 3,005 old canals, and renovated 9,137 water storage projects. The above projects can expand the irrigation area by more than 3.5 million mu. In terms of water and soil conservation, 824 small and medium-sized reservoirs have been completed or are under construction, more than 71,000 gully dams have been built, more than 150,000 mu of terraced fields have been repaired, more than 1.2 million mu of field ditches have been repaired, more than 14 million fish-scale pits, and more than 9,800 water cellars and ponds have been dug, and more than 700,000 mu of afforestation have been carried out, which can control a watershed area of more than 1,300 square kilometers. In terms of flood prevention and lowland transformation, more than 4.09 million mu of various ditches and paddy fields have been repaired, and 49 million cubic meters of earthwork have been completed for lowland transformation. In terms of large-scale water conservancy infrastructure construction, more than 15.5 million cubic meters of earthwork have been completed. The earthwork project of the Sinuisi Reduction River Project has completed 80% of the original plan.

    The person in charge pointed out that the outstanding characteristics of this year's water conservancy construction movement in Hebei Province are: early start, rapid action, large scale, and full of energy. From mid-October, the climax of the movement appeared successively in vast areas. The arrival of the high tide was two months earlier than in the winter of 1955. Another feature of the movement is that it is used as it is repaired, truly achieving "reservoirs are completed and canals are open, wells are completed and the land is leveled." Various localities, combined with drought resistance and wheat planting and strengthening wheat field management, were repairing projects while watering wheat, or storing water for irrigation in winter idle land, and new projects and existing water conservancy equipment were used together. For example, more than 300 members of Da Liu Village in Mancheng County opened a canal 1,500 meters long overnight and started watering the land at dawn.

    The person in charge said that the reason why the water conservancy movement has developed so rapidly, we believe that the first thing that must be done is that the secretaries must take action, the Party committees must be responsible, and the whole Party must run water conservancy. At the beginning of the movement, the Provincial Party Committee put forward the slogan of the whole Party and all the people running water conservancy, and emphasized that the first secretary should personally take action and deeply lead. This has played an important role in quickly setting off a high tide of water conservancy. At present, from the first secretary of the Provincial Party Committee to the secretary of the village branch, they are all personally grasping the water conservancy movement. In the Tangshan area, from the first secretary of the prefectural committee to the secretary of the township party committee, each person personally handled a key point, the first secretary of the prefectural committee grasped the township, and the first secretary of the county committee grasped the commune. This made it easier to guide the overall situation through key points.

    Second, it is necessary to raise socialist consciousness and overcome right-leaning conservative sentiments. In order to correct right-leaning conservative ideas and organize a great leap forward in production, Hebei Province convened a meeting of prefectural party committee secretaries and a provincial meeting of activists in water conservancy and fertilizer accumulation. Local prefectural committees convened meetings of county party committee secretaries, and counties convened three-level cadre meetings or activist conferences of thousands of people, some as many as three or four thousand, affirming and summarizing the achievements and experiences of the 1956 water conservancy movement and criticizing right-leaning conservative ideas; The province's plan for developing irrigation, after discussions in various localities, was increased from the original 6.5 million mu to 8 million to 10 million mu, and soil and water conservation was increased from the original 6,000 square kilometers to 7,250 square kilometers. Many counties have proposed to achieve comprehensive water conservancy in 1958. Experience has proven that as long as the masses are mobilized to launch a great debate, encourage the advanced, and drive the backward, a high tide of production can be set off.

    Third, as long as we strengthen political and ideological work and mobilize the masses, the masses can exert great power, voluntarily invest, contribute materials, and solve the material, financial, and technical difficulties in water conservancy construction. Two hundred and three members of Dazhang Village in Shahe County invested 20,000 yuan. Agricultural cooperatives in sixteen townships in Xushui County took out a total of 55,800 yuan from their public accumulation funds, and the members invested 10,800 yuan. In solving technical problems, many cooperatives have adopted the method of asking masters to bring apprentices, cultivating a large number of technical personnel, and many projects are surveyed and organized by the masses themselves. Relying on the wisdom of the masses, cultivating the masses' own technical strength, mobilizing the masses to invest in water conservancy, and reasonably formulating investment, interest payment, and repayment methods. This is an important method to solve the shortage of funds and technical strength.

    Finally, the person in charge told reporters that judging from the situation that the movement has already started, it is required that the leadership of the movement be more specific and in-depth. On the one hand, it is necessary to urge a small number of backward areas to catch up quickly and overcome the phenomenon of uneven movement; on the other hand, it is necessary to change the general leadership methods. Leading cadres must go deep to summarize experience and promote it, paying attention not only to the quantity of projects, but also to the quality and benefits of the projects. It is also necessary to pay attention to organizing a high tide of fertilizer accumulation on the basis of the high tide of water conservancy, so that water conservancy is "thousands of troops and horses are mobilized at the same time," and fertilizer accumulation is "thousands of vehicles and tens of thousands of burdens are mobilized at the same time."

    The person in charge said that after the movement was launched, counties, townships, and communes have extremely urgent requirements for water use. If there is water, it must be used, and if there is water, projects must be built. Especially for surface water, the water source is limited, and unplanned diversion often causes contradictions between regions, upstream and downstream, and left and right banks. Therefore, it is necessary to rationally allocate water use, and pay attention to exploiting underground water sources, drilling wells, digging springs, shallow wells and deep cones, and where conditions permit, ponds can be dug.

    全党全民一齐动手
    河北水利建设运动规模壮阔
    据新华社保定22日电　河北省大规模的水利建设运动已经进入高潮，获得显著成绩。为了了解运动发展的情况和经验，新华社记者访问了中共河北省委负责人。
    负责人说，目前，规模壮阔的群众性的水利建设运动，正以千军万马之势，在全省范围内普遍展开，并已形成了高潮。少数行动比较迟缓的地区，也已大踏步的赶了上来。到11月中旬的统计，全省投入水利建设运动的男女农民达四百九十多万人。全省已打各种水井十四万三千多眼，修旧井十一万五千多眼，打成机器井七百二十一眼，开成新的渠道八千四百九十六条，修复旧的渠道三千零五条，整修蓄水工程九千一百三十七处。以上工程共能扩大灌溉面积三百五十多万亩。在水土保持方面，已完成和正动工的中小型水库八百二十四座，已修成的谷坊七万一千多座，修整梯田十五万多亩，田间沟埂一百二十多万亩，挖鱼鳞坑一千四百多万个、水池水窖涝池九千八百多个，造林七十多万亩，共可控制流域面积一千三百多平方公里。在防涝和洼地改造方面，修好各种沟洫畦田四百零九万多亩，完成洼地改造土方四千九百多万公方。在大型水利基本建设方面，已完成土方一千五百五十多万公方。四女寺减河工程的土方工程已完成原计划的80％。
    负责人指出，今年河北省水利建设运动的突出特点是：动手早，行动快，规模大，劲头足。从10月中旬起，运动的高潮即在广大地区陆续出现。高潮的到来比1955年冬季提早了两个月。运动的另一个特点是随修随用，真正作到了“库成渠通，井成地平”。各地结合抗旱种麦和加强麦田管理，一面修工程，一面浇麦，或在冬闲地储水灌溉，新修工程和原有水利设备一齐使用。如满城县大六村三百多名社员一夜开了一千五百公尺长的渠道，天明就开始浇地。
    负责人说，水利运动所以迅速开展起来，我们认为，首先必须书记动手，党委负责，全党办水利。运动一开始，省委提出了全党全民办水利的口号，并强调第一书记亲自动手，深入领导。这对迅速掀起水利高潮有重要作用。目前，从省委第一书记到村支部书记，都亲自动手掌握水利运动。唐山地区从地委第一书记到乡党委书记是每人亲手搞一个重点，地委第一书记抓到乡，县委第一书记抓到社，这样层层抓下去，就便于通过重点指导全面。
    第二、必须提高社会主义觉悟，克服右倾保守情绪。为了纠正右倾保守思想，组织生产大跃进，河北省召开了地委书记会议、全省水利积肥积极分子会议，各地委均召开了县委书记会议，各县召开了上千人的有的多至三、四千人的三级干部会或积极分子大会等，肯定和总结了1956年水利运动的成绩和经验，批判了右倾保守思想；全省发展灌溉的计划，经过各地讨论之后，便由原定六百五十万亩，提高到八百万至一千万亩，水土保持由原定六千平方公里，提高到七千二百五十平方公里。不少的县提出1958年实现全面水利化。经验证明，只要发动群众展开大辩论，鼓励先进，带动落后，就能掀起生产高潮。
    第三、只要加强政治思想工作，把群众发动起来，群众就能发挥出巨大的力量，自愿地投资、投物料，解决水利建设的物力、资金和技术上的困难。沙河县大张村二百零三户社员投资两万元。徐水县十六个乡的农业社共拿出公积金五万五千八百元，社员投资一万零八百元。在解决技术问题上，许多社采取了请师傅带徒弟的办法，培养了大批技术人材，许多工程都是群众自己勘察，自己组织施工。依靠群众的智慧，培养群众自己的技术力量，发动群众向水利投资，并合理制定投资付息和归还的办法。这是解决资金和技术力量不足的重要方法。
    最后，负责人对记者说，从运动已经开展起来的情况看，要求对运动的领导更加具体、深入。一方面要督促少数落后地区迅速赶上去，克服运动不平衡现象；另一方面必须转变一般化的领导方法，领导干部要深入下去总结经验，加以推广，既要注意工程数量，更要注意工程的质量和效益。还要注意在水利高潮的基础上组织积肥运动的高潮，做到水利是“千军万马齐出动”，积肥是“千车万担齐动员”。
    负责人说，运动掀起以后，各县、乡、社对用水的要求极为迫切，有水就要利用，有水就要修工程，特别是地上水，水源有限，无计划地引用，常常会引起地区与地区、上游与下游、左岸与右岸之间的矛盾。因此要合理的分配用水，并注意挖掘地下水源，打井凿泉，浅井深锥，有条件的可以开挖池塘。
