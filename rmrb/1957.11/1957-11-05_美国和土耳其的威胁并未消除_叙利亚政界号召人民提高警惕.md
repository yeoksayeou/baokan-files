Xinhua News Agency, November 4th, New York dispatch: Syrian Ambassador to the United States, Zeineddine, said in a television interview on the 3rd that "war could still break out at any time" on the Syrian-Turkish border. The threat from the Turkish army assembled on the Syrian border has not been eliminated after the United Nations General Assembly concluded its discussion on the issue.

He said: "Some countries hope that the situation in the Middle East will change according to their wishes. If they cannot do this by other means, they may try to achieve their goals by war."

When reporters later asked him who he was referring to by "some countries," Zeineddine replied that Syria had uncovered a plot to overthrow the Syrian government two months ago, and the investigation revealed that the case involved three American diplomats.

Zeineddine condemned the Eisenhower Doctrine as intended to allow the United States to fill the vacuum left in the Middle East by the decline of British and French power.

Damascus dispatch: Syrian political leaders and newspapers are calling on the people to heighten their vigilance and pay close attention to new U.S. conspiracies against Syria. They affirmed Syria's achievements in the United Nations, while also pointing out the changes in U.S. tactics after the conclusion of the debate on Syria's indictment.

Jabri, Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Syrian Parliament, said on the 2nd that the current situation in Syria cannot be considered to have a "guarantee against aggression." He pointed out that, as far as we know, the imperialists are plotting their new conspiracies, and we must continue to pay very close attention to future events.

Dawalibi, Secretary-General of the Syrian People's Party, also said on the same day, "We have discovered that the governments that once attacked the Arabs are still doing so," which is why we now advocate bringing our indictment to the United Nations.

Editorials in "Al-Alef Baa" and "Al-Jamahir" on the 3rd, in analyzing the conclusion of the United Nations debate on Syria's indictment, both pointed out that the struggle is not over. All indications prove that, although the imperialists have changed their tactics, they have not changed their goals. We must consider the possibility that the United States may turn to launching conspiracies against Syria from within and engaging in a long-term cold war.

    美国和土耳其的威胁并未消除
    叙利亚政界号召人民提高警惕
    本报综合报道　据新华社4日讯纽约消息：叙利亚驻美国大使宰尼丁3日在电视节目谈话中说，在叙利亚—土耳其边境“仍然有可能在任何时候爆发战争”。在联合国大会关于这个问题的讨论结束以后，集结在叙利亚边境的土耳其军队的威胁并没有消除。
    他说：“某些国家盼望中东局势按照它们的愿望改变。如果它们不能用其他办法做到这点，它们就有可能试图用战争的办法达到目的。”
    事后有记者问他，他所指的某些国家是谁，宰尼丁回答说，两个月以前叙利亚破获了一个阴谋推翻叙利亚政府的案件，结果查出这件事与三个美国外交人员有关。
    宰尼丁谴责艾森豪威尔主义是为了使美国填补由于英法势力衰退而在中东留下的真空。
    大马士革消息：叙利亚政界领袖和报纸都号召人民提高警惕，密切注意美国对叙利亚的新阴谋。他们肯定了叙利亚在联合国中所取得的成就，同时也指出了在叙利亚控诉案结束辩论以后美国在策略上的变化。
    叙利亚议会外交委员会主席贾比里2日说，不能认为叙利亚目前的形势已经有了“没有侵略的保证”。他指出，据我们知道，帝国主义者正在策划他们的新阴谋，我们必须继续非常小心地注视未来的事件。
    叙利亚人民党总书记达瓦利比同一天也说，“我们发现，过去曾经进攻阿拉伯的各国政府现在还在这样做”，那就是为什么我们现在主张把我们的控诉提到联合国的理由。
      “阿利夫巴报”和“群众报”3日的社论在分析联合国结束对叙利亚控诉案的辩论时都指出，斗争还没有结束，一切迹象证明，虽然帝国主义者改变了他们的策略，可是他们并没有改变他们的目的。我们必须考虑到美国可能转而从内部对叙利亚发动阴谋，并进行长期冷战。
