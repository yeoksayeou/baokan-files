The room was full of people, and the smoke from a dozen or so pipes filled the air. The flame of the small oil lamp flickered in the wind blowing in from the window. At tonight's debate, commune member Wang Zijang was the first to speak. He said: "I never used to be in debt. Now, with three people and two laborers in my family, I built three houses and still owe the credit union over 100 yuan. Where did all this money go? I think life has deteriorated since joining the commune. I hope everyone can discuss my problem!"

Zhao Yiqiang's wife disagreed with Wang Zijang, saying, "In the past, the landlord looked down on us. We were like oxen and horses for the landlord, and if we didn't have grain to eat, they wouldn't lend it to us. Now, if we don't have enough to eat, we just get a slip from the commune and get it. In the past, my family never had anyone going to school. How could such a good thing as schooling ever have been our turn! Now my son is in high school. How can you say that life hasn't improved since joining the commune?"

Zhao Pushan said: "In the past, I worked in the black tunnels of the Mentougou coal mine, and my family had nothing to eat. After liberation, I turned over a new leaf, bought livestock, and a cart. After joining the commune, I spent more than 160 yuan to buy a new bicycle. How can you say that life hasn't improved? I think today's life is truly heaven and earth compared to the past."

Zhao Yiqiang's wife then asked Wang Zijang: "You worked your whole life for the landlord, yet you didn't even build one house. Why didn't you build one?"

Wang Zijang said, "That goes without saying, I couldn't afford it, I didn't have the money to build it."

Zhao Pushan also asked Wang Zijang: "During the Kuomintang era, when they conscripted carters, why didn't the landlord go, and instead called you to drive the cart?"

Another person asked Wang Zijang: "You risked your life to drive the landlord's cart back. What did the landlord give you?"

Wang Zijang said, "He gave me nothing, just two slaps in the face."

Wang Zijang's wife had been holding back for a long time. She was angry that her husband was lying through his teeth. Thinking of the bitter days of the past, how could he say that the path of cooperativization was wrong and that life had deteriorated? Finally, she spoke: "Chairman Mao's way is good, and I will follow Chairman Mao's way to the end. Everyone knows that it was the Communist Party that came and gave us eight mu of land. In the past, when I asked Zhang Wanchun (Zhang Wanchun was the landlord for whom Wang Zijang did long-term labor) to borrow some food, he said he would give me bran. Anyone who says the landlord is good is a bastard. I say the landlord is a black-hearted wolf. Now, the food we eat, the drink we drink, the clothes we wear, the houses we live in, aren't all better than in the past? He asks where the money went. Wasn't it all spent by our own families?"

At this time, Wang Zijang lowered his head and said, "I'm not saying that cooperativization is bad. I myself have tasted the sweetness of cooperativization. I was just confused for a moment."

    到底提高了还是降低了？
    屋里坐满了人，十几只旱烟锅子熏得烟雾腾腾的。小油灯的火舌被窗口吹进来的风刮得忽闪忽闪。今晚的辩论会上，社员王子江头一个发言。他说：“我过去没欠过账，现在三口人两个劳动力，就盖了三间房子，便欠下信用社一百多块钱。我这钱到哪儿去了呢？我看入社后生活是降低了。我的问题大家讨论讨论吧！”
    赵义强的妻不同意王子江的话，她说：“过去地主看不起我们，我们给地主当牛当马，没粮吃向地主去借他们不借，现在我们没有吃的，开个条子到社里就拿来了。过去我家就没有上学的，上学这种好事哪能轮上我们呢！现在我儿子上了高中，怎么能说入了社生活没有提高呢？”
    赵普山说：“我过去在门头沟煤窑滚黑洞子，家里根本就没有吃的。一解放，我翻了身，买了牲口套了大车。入社后，我花一百六十多元买了一辆新自行车，这怎能说生活没有提高？我看今天的日子和过去比，真是天上地下。”
    赵义强的妻接着问王子江：“你过去给地主扛了一辈子长活，你连一间房子都没有盖上，你为什么不盖呢？”
    王子江说：“这还用说，我盖不起，没有钱盖嘛。”
    赵普山也问王子江：“国民党时候抓大车，地主为什么不去，叫你去赶大车？”
    又一个人问王子江：“你舍命把地主的大车赶回来，地主给了你些什么？”
    王子江说：“屁也没给我，给了我两个耳光。”
    王子江的妻子憋气好半天了，她气她的丈夫睁眼说瞎话，想想过去的苦日子，怎能说合作化的路走错了，生活降低了呢？最后，她说话了：“毛主席的这个道道好，我就跟着毛主席的这个道道走到底。老少爷儿们都知道，是共产党来了我们才分八亩地，过去我问张万春（张万春就是王子江给他扛长工的地主）借点吃的，他说给我谷糠，谁说地主好是王八旦，我就说地主是黑心狼。现在，我们吃的，喝的，穿的，住的，哪一样不比过去强，他问人家钱到哪儿去了，还不是我们自家花了。”
    这时，王子江低着头说：“我并不是说合作化不好，合作化的甜头我自己就尝到了，我是一时迷糊了。”
