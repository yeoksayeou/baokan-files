The October Revolution inaugurated a new era in human history, first demonstrating the great changes in people's ideology and the beginning of revolutionary culture. The great Marxist-Leninist thought guides Soviet musicians to faithfully serve the interests of the motherland, to serve the socialist cause of the whole people, and to resolutely embark on the path of popularization and realism. Therefore, Soviet music today occupies a leading position in the forefront of progressive music culture worldwide.

Over the past forty years, guaranteed by the incomparably superior socialist system, Soviet music has both inherited the excellent traditions of the Russian classical music school and innovated and developed in new ways. Older generation composers, such as Ippolitov-Ivanov, Glazunov, Glière, and Vasilenko, all participated in the construction of Soviet modern music, and their creativity was even more vigorous in the Soviet era. Glière's famous ballet music "The Red Poppy," "The Bronze Horseman," and "Taras Bulba" were all works after the October Revolution, which played a significant role in the development of Soviet ballet art. Hundreds of Soviet musicians who grew up in the socialist era have surpassed their older counterparts in their achievements. Among them, Myaskovsky, Shaporin, Prokofiev, Shostakovich, Khachaturian, Kabalevsky, Lev Revutsky, Davidenko, Khrennikov, and many other excellent composers have held high the banner of socialist realism art, powerfully leading the path of Soviet musical creation and laying the foundation of Soviet music.

The creative genres and forms of Soviet music are diverse, and in various types of creation, countless excellent exemplary works have been produced, blossoming with golden artistic flowers. In the past thirty years, the Soviet Union has successfully developed symphonic music, faithfully inheriting and carrying forward the great achievements of Beethoven and Tchaikovsky's symphonic art, and enriching the world music scene. Myaskovsky's Symphony No. 27, Prokofiev's "Classical Symphony" and Symphony No. 7, Shostakovich's Symphony No. 1 and 5, and the patriotic Symphony No. 7, created in 1941 in the besieged city of Leningrad, as well as the recent Symphony No. 10, Khachaturian's Symphony No. 2, Kabalevsky's Symphony No. 4, etc., are only a part of the successful Soviet symphonic works; these works profoundly embody the ideological emotions of the Soviet people and deeply arouse the people's resonance for loving the motherland. These outstanding symphonic works have been welcomed all over the world, frequently used as concert programs, and brought people the most precious spiritual food.

Soviet music is deeply imbued with a kind of great emotional authenticity, touching the hearts of every ordinary person. Through various genres of Soviet musical works, the spiritual essence of the Soviet era is widely reflected, and the life and struggle of the Soviet people are universally reflected. Excellent Soviet operas, such as Shaporin's "The Decembrists," Kabalevsky's "The Taras Family," Meitus's "Young Guard," and Khrennikov's "The Storm," all truly embody the spiritual outlook of the people and guide the people to move forward on the road to communism. And ballet music, such as Glière's "The Red Poppy," "The Bronze Horseman," and "Taras Bulba" mentioned above, as well as Prokofiev's "Cinderella," "Romeo and Juliet," and "The Stone Flower," Asafiev's "The Flames of Paris," "The Fountain of Bakhchisarai," "The Prisoner of the Caucasus," and "The Peasant Girl," Khachaturian's new ballet "Spartacus," and many other ballet music all focus on expressing the people's desire to love freedom and build a happy life. These music are so perfect in terms of ideological content, technical methods, style and tonality, which makes people more and more feel the richness and loveliness of the cultural life of socialist society and strengthens people's belief in life.

Soviet musical culture is truly built on a democratic and popular foundation. Soviet music is connected with the broad masses and penetrates into the people's work and life. Therefore, the mass character of Soviet art is a noble characteristic of Soviet music. Soviet popular songs are extremely rich and colorful, and are very widely spread, with songs everywhere throughout the country. These songs have penetrated into the daily life of thousands of people, become an indispensable part of life, and powerfully prove the correct path of Soviet musical creation. Soviet songs are not only loved by the Soviet people, but also enthusiastically welcomed by our Chinese people, and have given us a profound influence. I only need to mention a few song titles, such as "March of the World Democratic Youth," "Moscow-Beijing," "Katyusha," "March of the Motherland," and everyone will immediately think of many Soviet popular songs that we love very much. On the other hand, Soviet musicians have also made outstanding achievements in the creation of solo songs, such as Shaporin's song collection composed of eight elegies, and adapted ancient and modern folk songs, Glière's vocal concerto, etc., all occupy an important position in the treasure house of world vocal literature.

The mass character of Soviet music is also reflected in the vigorous development of amateur musical activities. The ranks of amateur musicians and singers have expanded to millions. In terms of creation, more and more amateur music lovers have become direct participants in music creation. Under the unparalleled prosperity of amateur musical activities and the strong guarantee of school music education, a large number of professional performers with world reputation have emerged in the past forty years. They have reached the peak of socialist culture in terms of technology and artistic expression, surpassing the achievements of their predecessors. I am referring to those masters, such as: Nezhdanova, Sobinov, Obukhova, Igumnov, Golovanov, Mravinsky, Ivanov, Oborin, Oistrakh, Gilels, Sofronitsky, Rostropovich, Shafran, Kogan, Richter, Nikolaeva, Guseva, etc. Their performance level ranks first in the world and has won the highest medals in various international competitions, which proves the unparalleled superiority of the Soviet performance school; they radiantly hold high the bright banner of socialist art. In short, the development and prosperity of Soviet music is a manifestation of the great victory of Marxist-Leninist theory, the proletarian regime, and the socialist system on the cultural front! I excitedly cheer for the great achievements of the Soviet Union! I pay tribute to the "Great 40th Anniversary" with the most sublime intentions! I congratulate that the torch of the October Revolution will illuminate the whole world.

    苏联音乐的光辉成就
    喻宜萱
    十月革命开创了人类史的新纪元，首先表明在人们思想意识中的伟大变改和革命文化的开始。伟大的马列主义思想指导着苏联音乐家忠实地为祖国利益服务，为建设社会主义的全民事业服务，坚决地走向人民性和现实主义的发展道路。因而，苏联音乐在今天，正属于全世界进步音乐文化的最前列的领导地位。
    四十年来，在具有无比优越性的社会主义制度的保证下，苏联音乐一方面继承了俄罗斯古典音乐学派的优良传统，一方面更为推陈出新地获得了新的发展。老一辈的作曲家，如：伊波里托夫、伊凡诺夫、格拉祖诺夫、格里埃尔、瓦西连科等人都参加了苏联现代音乐的建设，他们的创作力在苏维埃时代显示得更加旺盛。格里埃尔的著名舞剧音乐“红罂粟”、“青铜骑士”和“达拉斯·布尔巴”都是十月革命以后的作品，对于苏联舞剧艺术的发展起了很大的作用。而在社会主义年代里成长起来的苏联音乐家则数以百计，他们的成就更超过了老一辈。其中米雅科夫斯基、沙波林、普罗科菲耶夫、萧斯塔科维奇、哈恰图良、卡巴列夫斯基、列乌茨基、达维琴科、赫连尼科夫，以及其他许多优秀的作曲家们则高高地举起了社会主义现实主义艺术的旗帜，有力地领导着苏联音乐创作的道路，奠定了苏联音乐的基础。
    苏联音乐的创作体裁和形式是多种多样的，而在各种类型的创作中，都产生了无数优秀的典范作品，开出了金光闪闪的艺术之花。在最近三十多年来，苏联成功地发展了交响乐，忠实地继承并发扬了贝多芬、柴可夫斯基的交响乐艺术的伟大成就，丰富了全世界的乐坛。米雅科夫斯基的第二十七交响曲，普罗科菲耶夫的“古典交响曲”和第七交响曲，萧斯塔科维奇的第一和第五、和1941年在受法西斯匪徒们包围的列宁格勒城所创作的爱国主义的第七交响曲，以及近年来所创作的第十交响曲，哈恰图良的第二交响曲、卡巴列夫斯基的第四交响曲等优秀作品，只是苏联成功的交响乐作品中的一部分；这些作品深刻地体现了苏维埃人民的思想情绪，深深地激起了人民热爱祖国的共鸣。这些卓越的交响乐作品受到了全世界的欢迎，被经常采用为音乐会的节目，带给了人们最珍贵的精神食粮。
    苏联音乐都深深地蕴藏着一种伟大感情的真实性，打动着每一个普通人的心弦。通过各种体裁的苏联音乐作品，广泛地反映了苏维埃时代的精神实质，普遍地反映了苏联人民的生活和斗争。优秀的苏联歌剧，如：沙波林的“十二月党人”、卡巴列夫斯基的“塔拉斯一家”、梅伊杜斯的“青年近卫军”和赫连尼科夫的“暴风雨”，都真实地体现了人民的精神面貌，指导着人民向共产主义道路前进。而舞剧音乐，如上面所提到过的格里埃尔的“红罂粟”、“青铜骑士”和“达拉斯·布尔巴”，以及普罗科菲耶夫的“灰姑娘”、“罗米欧与朱丽叶”和“宝石花”，阿萨菲耶夫的“巴黎的火焰”、“巴赫契萨莱城的喷泉”、“高加索的囚徒”和“农村姑娘”，哈恰图良的新舞剧“斯巴达人”，以及其他许多舞剧音乐都集中地表现了人民热爱自由和建设幸福生活的愿望。这些音乐在思想内容上，技术方法上，风格和曲调性等方面都是那样的尽善尽美，使人愈益感到社会主义社会文化生活的丰富可爱，加强了人们对生活的信念。
    苏联的音乐文化是真正建立在民主的、人民的基础上的。苏联音乐联系着广大的群众，深入到人民的工作与生活，因而苏联艺术的大众性正是苏联音乐的崇高的特征。苏联群众歌曲是极其丰富多采的，而且流传得非常广泛，全国各个角落到处是歌声。这些歌曲已经渗透到千千万万人的日常生活里，变成了生活中不可缺少的部分，有力地证明苏联音乐创作的正确道路。苏联歌曲不但为苏联人民所热爱，而且受到了我们中国人民的热情欢迎，并给我们以深遽的影响。我只须稍微提起几首曲名，如：“世界民主青年进行曲”、“莫斯科—北京”、“喀秋莎”、“祖国进行曲”，大家就会立刻想起许多我们十分喜爱的苏联群众歌曲，另一方面，苏联音乐家们在独唱歌曲的创作上也取得了出色的成就，如：沙波林的由八首悲歌组成的歌曲集，及改编的古今民歌，格里埃尔的声乐协奏曲等在世界声乐文献的宝库中都占着重要的地位。
    苏联音乐的大众性还表现在业余音乐活动的蓬勃发展，业余音乐家和歌唱家的队伍已扩展到几百万人。在创作上，愈来愈多的业余音乐爱好者成为音乐创作的直接参加者。在业余音乐活动的无比繁荣的情况下，和学校音乐教育的有力保证下，四十年来涌现了大批的拥有世界声誉的专业表演家，他们在技术上和艺术表现上，都达到了社会主义文化的高峰，超越了前人的成就。我所指的是那些大师，如：涅日达诺娃、索比诺夫、奥布霍娃、伊古姆诺夫、果洛伐诺夫、姆拉文斯基、伊凡诺夫、奥伯林、奥伊斯特拉赫、吉列尔斯、索夫罗尼茨基、罗斯特罗波维奇、沙夫朗、科冈、李赫特尔、尼科拉耶娃、古谢娃等，他们的表演水平居世界的第一位，获得历次国际竞赛的最高奖章，这证明苏联表演学派的无比优越性；他们光芒四射地高举着社会主义艺术的鲜明旗帜。总之，苏联音乐的如此发达，如此繁荣，正说明马列主义学说，无产阶级政权，社会主义制度在文化战线上的伟大胜利的一种表现！我兴奋地为苏联的伟大成就欢呼！我以最崇高的心意向“伟大的四十周年”致敬！我祝贺十月革命的巨炬将照亮全世界。
