In many units, the following problem has been encountered during the blooming and contending: the masses are afraid to openly criticize their "immediate superiors." Some are reluctant to hurt feelings, while others are afraid of retaliation and want to put up big-character posters but are afraid to do so. Therefore, how to eliminate the masses' concerns about criticizing their "immediate superiors" has become a very important task. In this regard, the members of the Communist Party in the North China Engineering Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Construction Engineering have played a significant role.

The general public in the North China Engineering Administration Bureau originally had concerns about criticizing their "immediate superiors." In order to allow them to speak freely and boldly express their opinions, the Party members and leading cadres of this bureau took the lead in criticizing their "immediate superiors," supporting the masses, or "setting themselves on fire." For example, the masses in the Production Section had many opinions about the section chief, Dong Panxing, but were afraid that Dong would not accept them, so they were all watching the attitude of the Party member and section chief, Guo Houji. Guo Houji took the lead in putting up a big-character poster criticizing Section Chief Dong, and the masses followed suit. Xu Shizhong, the Party member and section chief of the Wage Section, knew that clerk Wen Jianxin had opinions about him but was afraid to express them, so he took the initiative to talk to Wen and encourage him to put up a big-character poster criticizing him, breaking the situation in which no one in the section dared to offer opinions to the Party member and section chief.

Not only did the Party members of this bureau take the lead in criticizing their "immediate superiors" to promote the blooming and contending of the masses, but the leading cadres who were criticized also made it clear at any time that they supported the criticism of the masses. After the Party member and section chief, Li Kecheng, was criticized by the masses, Wang Qi, and others in a big-character poster for over-reporting travel expenses, he immediately put up a big-character poster to express his acceptance of the opinions and returned the funds. Many other leading comrades also made it clear that they supported and encouraged the masses when they inquired about their attitude towards criticism.

The practices of the Party members and leading cadres of the North China Engineering Administration Bureau are worthy of emulation, especially by those leaders who are afraid of the blooming and contending of the masses!

    要给群众撑腰
    不少单位在鸣放中都遇到了这样一个问题：群众不敢公开批评“顶头上司”。有些人是打不开情面，有些人则害怕报复，想贴大字报但又不敢贴。因此，如何消除群众对批评“顶头上司”的顾虑，就成为一个很重要的工作。在这方面，建筑工程部华北工程管理局的党员，起了很大作用。
    华北工程管理局的一般群众，原来对批评“顶头上司”有顾虑。为了使他们畅所欲言，大胆地提出意见，这个局的党员和领导干部就带头批评“顶头上司”，给群众撑腰，或者自己“引火烧身”。如生产处的群众对处长董攀兴有不少意见，但怕董接受不了，不敢提，都在观望党员科长郭厚基的态度。郭厚基就带头贴出批评董处长的大字报，群众也就跟着贴。工资处的党员科长徐世忠，知道科员温建新对自己有意见不敢提，他就主动找温谈话，动员温给自己贴大字报，打破了该处没人敢给党员科长提意见的局面。
    这个局不但党员带头批评“顶头上司”，推动群众鸣放，而且受到批评的领导干部，也随时明确表示态度支持群众的批评。党员处长李克诚在群众汪圻等人贴大字报批评他多报旅差费后，他立即贴出大字报表示接受意见并退出款项。还有许多领导同志在群众向他们探听对他批评的态度时，也都明确表示支持和鼓励。
    华北工程管理局的党员和领导干部的做法，是值得效法的，特别是值得那些害怕群众鸣放的领导人深思！
