    Old Li and His Bicycle	Beijing Knitting Factory, Zhang Zhizhong
    A little over two months ago, Old Li, the Party Branch Secretary, exchanged his British-made "Hand Brand" bicycle for the old Japanese bicycle of the correspondent, Xiao Zhang. However, during this rectification campaign for soliciting opinions, the workers brought up the matter of the bicycle again, posting big-character posters with slogans like "Judging People by Bicycles," "A Party Branch Secretary with Special Privileges," "Is this Leading by Example?" and so on, raising very sharp criticisms. The posters sparked a debate among the crowd. Some said, "The bicycles have already been exchanged, there's no use in bringing it up now." Those who disagreed argued, "The purpose of the rectification campaign isn't just to correct shortcomings, but also to dig deep into our thinking and take it to a new level!" Therefore, they believed it was necessary to bring it up.
    These past few days, Old Li has visibly lost weight: his cheekbones protruded, and his eyes were deeply sunken. He could only sleep three or four hours a day, and even then, the masses felt he wasn't improving fast enough! Old Li simply stopped going home and set up a temporary bed in his office. When he was extremely tired, he would lie down, close his eyes, rest his mind, and then continue working. For two consecutive nights, he wrote self-criticisms, systemizing the workers' opinions into three aspects: First, he didn't go to the workshops often enough, lacking a deep understanding of reality. Second, he acted high and mighty, forgetting that he was originally a worker himself. Third, he was treated specially. On the morning of the general meeting, he squeezed in some time to take a bath, get a haircut, and shave his beard. His face immediately looked clean, and his spirits seemed to increase tenfold.
    "Let me speak from my heart to everyone!" That's how he began when he spoke about the third aspect:
    "I had only been riding that new bicycle for two days when I heard comrades discussing it. 'Once you become the branch secretary, the first thing you do is get a good bicycle to ride!' I also heard things like:
  'What's so great about riding a good bicycle? It's still for serving everyone!' At the time, I couldn't understand it. I thought: What's wrong with a leading cadre riding a good bicycle? Once, when I was riding to a meeting, I ran into some acquaintances. As soon as they saw the bicycle, they asked: 'Hey! A British Hand Brand, is it new?' My face suddenly felt hot. I replied that it was the factory's bicycle, for everyone to use. They half-jokingly said: 'Does your factory have Hand Brand bicycles for everyone?' I didn't dare to look them in the eye. After that, whenever I rode this bicycle, I was afraid of people asking about it; it felt like I had done something wrong, and I always felt uneasy. I struggled with this several times, wanting to give the bicycle up, but I couldn't bear to part with it. Later, I went to the workshop and overheard two workers talking. One said: 'The branch secretary is here, look at his bicycle!' 'That's right, the name is engraved on it!' This really stabbed my heart. I made up my mind then and there that I must exchange the bicycle. As soon as I got back to the factory, I immediately found the correspondent, Xiao Zhang, and exchanged bicycles. That evening, I received a letter from Xiao Zhang, saying: I guarantee to complete my work, save time, and be accurate and error-free! And I guarantee to wipe the bicycle clean every day, making it shine like new forever!'" Old Li finished this account, then changed to a crisp and energetic tone, saying: "As a Party member, especially a leading cadre, we should always maintain purity and simplicity, and not have even a speck of dust or hypocrisy on our bodies. If we do, we must quickly brush it off! This rectification campaign is giving me a clean bath! And it should be like a bathhouse worker scrubbing off all the dirt!

    老李和他的自行车	北京针织厂　张志中
    两个多月以前，党支部书记老李把自己骑的这辆英国手牌的自行车和通讯员小张那辆旧了的日本车互换了。可是，这次整风提意见，工人们又把这辆车子的事提了出来，贴了大字报，什么“以车看人”，“特殊化的党支部书记”，“这是以身作则吗？”等等，提得很尖锐。对这几张大字报，人群里起了争论，有的说：“车子已经换了，提不提的没用了。”不同意这个意见的人则说：“整风提意见不光是把缺点改了，而且还要在思想上刨根挖底提高一步！”所以认为提出来很必要。
    这几天，老李明显的瘦了：颧骨鼓了出来，两眼也深深地陷下去了；每天只能睡三、四个小时的觉，就这样，群众还嫌改得慢呢！老李干脆不回家了，在办公室临时搭了一个铺，实在困极了，就倒下来闭会眼，歇歇精神，接着又干。他连着两个晚上写检讨，将工人们提出来的意见系统了三个方面：第一、下车间少，深入实际不够。第二、架子大，忘了自己原来也是工人。第三、特殊。在开大会的当天上午，他挤了个功夫，洗了澡，理了发，胡子也刮了，顿时脸子显出干净来，精神也像增加好几十倍。
    “我和大家说心里话吧！”当他讲到第三个方面时，一开始就这样说：
    “我骑那辆新车子，没骑两天，我就听见同志们议论了，‘当上支书，先弄个好车子骑骑！’也听见这样的话：
  ‘骑好车子有啥，还不是给大伙办事！’我当时也想不通，觉着：一个领导干部骑上辆好车又有什么呢？有一次，我骑车去开会，碰上几个熟人，他们一看见这辆车子就问：‘嘿！英国手牌，是新买的吗？’我的脸忽地热起来，我回答这是厂子的车，是分给大家骑用的。他们半开玩笑地说：‘你们厂子都是手牌的自行车吗？’我简直不敢抬头看他们了。以后，我骑着这辆车，总怕别人问起；好像作了什么错事，心总是不自在。我也斗争了好几次，想把车子让出去，可我总舍不得。后来，我到车间去，偶然听到两个工人说话。一个说：‘支书来了，你看车子！’‘不错，车上都刻着名字哩！’这一下可把我的心刺疼了，当时我就下了决心，一定换车。回到厂部，我马上找到通讯员小张把车子换了个过。晚上接到小张的一封信，信里说：我保证完成工作，争取时间，准确无错！并保证每天擦车，要把车子擦得亮亮的，永远像新的一样！……”老李他讲完这段经历，换了一种脆爽的语调说：“作个党员，尤其是领导干部，应该永远保持纯洁、朴实，身上不能有一点灰尘和虚伪，有了就赶紧弹掉！这次整风就是给我洗一个干净的澡！而且要像搓洗工那样地把所有的脏泥搓掉！
