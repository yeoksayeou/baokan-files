At the meeting, experiences in preventing silica dust hazards in mines and factories were exchanged; seven proposals, including factory dust control technology, mine dust control technology, silicosis diagnosis, and dust measurement methods, were discussed. The meeting reached a consensus on how to carry out prevention of silica dust hazards in the future.
