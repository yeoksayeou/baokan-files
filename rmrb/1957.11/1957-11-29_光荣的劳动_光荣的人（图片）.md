    Glorious Labor, Glorious People
    Wang Baofa, an advanced producer from the Motor Branch of the Tianjin Power Plant, is connecting scrap wires. Wang Baofa is an old worker with a high level of awareness. In the eight years since liberation, he has never asked for leave or been absent from work, and he is very diligent and thrifty in his work. He picks up every screw and piece of copper wire he sees to be used again. He used old iron plates instead of new ones to make distribution panels, and suggested that the plant dig up unused cables buried underground for many years to be used again, saving a large amount of resources.

    光荣的劳动  光荣的人
    天津发电厂电机分厂先进生产者王保发在接碎电线。王保发是一个有高度觉悟的老工人。解放八年来，他从未请过假、旷过工，在工作上又很勤俭。他看到一个螺丝钉、一截铜丝都要拣起来以备再用。他用旧铁板代替新铁板制成配电盘，又建议厂里把埋在地下多年不用的电缆挖出来再用，节省了大批资财。	新华社记者  田明摄
