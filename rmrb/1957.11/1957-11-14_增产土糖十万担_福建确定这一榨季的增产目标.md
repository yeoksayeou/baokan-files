Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, November 13th: The Fujian Province Local Sugar Milling Experience Exchange Conference recently concluded, resolving that the province's five thousand plus local sugar mills will increase production of local sugar by 100,000 dan during the 1957-1958 milling season.

More than one hundred local sugar mill cadres and veteran technicians who attended the meeting introduced nineteen experiences for improving sugarcane yield and quality, such as "small hoe low cutting" and "adding water for pressing," which were widely valued by those present. Simply promoting the two experiences of "small hoe low cutting" and "adding water for pressing" could increase sugar production by nearly 70,000 dan in a single sugarcane season throughout the province.

Fujian is one of China's main sugarcane producing areas, and its many sugarcane farmers have accumulated rich experience in increasing production. During this conference, representatives from the sugarcane producing areas of Guangdong, Guangxi, Jiangxi, and Hunan also attended.
