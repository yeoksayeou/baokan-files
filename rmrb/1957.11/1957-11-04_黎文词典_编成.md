Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 3rd. Li ethnic language workers in the Hainan Li and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, with the help of the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Minority Languages Survey Team, have recently completed the compilation of the "Li Dictionary" and the "Li Farmers' Textbook". The "Li Dictionary" has more than three thousand words, and the selected words are mainly basic dialect words, and also absorb common dialect words.

The Li script is a new script created only at the beginning of this year. It uses Latin alphabet phonetics, has fixed pronunciation, and is simple and easy to learn. The results of pilot teaching in four classes established in the first half of this year show that students can generally write letters after three months of study.

    “黎文词典”编成
    新华社广州3日电　海南黎族苗族自治州黎文工作者，在中国科学院少数民族语言调查工作队的帮助下，最近已先后完成“黎文词典”、“黎文农民课本”的编写工作。“黎文词典”共有三千多个词汇，所选的词是以基础方言词为主，并吸收有普遍性的方言词。
    黎族文字是今年初才创造的新文字，它采用拉丁字母拼音，发音固定，简单易学，今年上半年设立的四个班试教结果，学员们经过三个月的学习，普遍能写信。
