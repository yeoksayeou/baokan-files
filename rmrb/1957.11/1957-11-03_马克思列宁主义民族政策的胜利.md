The victory of the Marxist-Leninist National Policy
Bao Erhan
On the occasion of the fortieth anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution, we, together with the great Soviet people, commemorate and celebrate this festival with incomparable joy and pride. Because the great October Socialist Revolution overthrew the Tsarist reactionary rule for the first time in world history, and established the political power of the proletarian dictatorship. It caused the capitalist society that sold people as commodities to collapse, opened up an era of building a free and happy socialist society that mankind has been looking forward to for many years, and pointed out the road to national liberation for the people of colonial countries and all people suffering from various social and national oppressions. It has profoundly influenced the international workers' movement, became the beginning of the proletarian revolution era, and enabled the oppressed proletariat all over the world to master an incomparably strong and scientific weapon—Marxism-Leninism.

The great October Socialist Revolution has deeply influenced the liberation struggles of the oppressed people in Asia and other countries. Mr. Sun Yat-sen once said on November 23, 1924: "China and the Russian revolution are on the same path. Therefore, China and Russia are not only friendly, but in terms of revolutionary relations, they are actually one family." Chairman Mao Zedong said in his historically significant article "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship": "The salvoes of the October Revolution brought us Marxism-Leninism. The October Revolution helped the advanced elements of the world, including China, to use the proletarian worldview as a tool to observe the destiny of the country and reconsider their own problems. Taking the path of the Russians—this is the conclusion." Therefore, we can say that the victory of the Chinese people's revolution is a continuation of the victory of the great October Socialist Revolution.

The Soviet Union is a multi-ethnic country with more than sixty nationalities. Before the great October Socialist Revolution, most of these ethnic groups were very backward, and some were even in the era of patriarchal clans. The oppression and exploitation of reactionary regimes and feudal lords over the years left them with painful wounds and heavy burdens. It takes a lot of arduous work to heal these wounds. In Russia, which has such a complex multi-ethnic composition, the great Lenin created the Marxist scientific theory of the national question in order to solve the national question. When the great October Socialist Revolution won, the Soviet government immediately began to implement Lenin's Marxist proletarian internationalist national policy. On November 15, 1917, the "Declaration of Rights of the Peoples of Russia" was signed and promulgated by comrades Lenin and Stalin. This declaration not only reflected the aspirations of the oppressed working people for hundreds of years, but also represented the unchangeable law of equal rights and free development of all ethnic groups. At the same time, this declaration also proved to the oppressed people of all ethnic groups that national liberation is impossible without overthrowing the feudal landlord exploitative class and the bourgeois regime, and that only socialism can free the people of all ethnic groups from oppression and exploitation.

Under the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government, due to the correct implementation of Lenin's national policy and the help of the great Russian people to all minority nationalities, the people of more than sixty nationalities living in the Soviet Union have achieved great development in politics, economy, culture and other aspects in the past forty years. The great Soviet Union has become a big family of unity and fraternity among all ethnic groups, and there are no more backward people there. The republics of Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan were relatively backward before the October Socialist Revolution. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government, due to the implementation of Lenin's national policy and the fraternal assistance of the great Russian people, the culture, education and industry of these places have greatly surpassed the neighboring capitalist countries in Asia. For example, according to various statistics, compared with the industrial production volume in 1956 and 1913, Kazakhstan exceeded 36 times, Uzbekistan exceeded 14 times, Tajikistan exceeded 27 times, and Kyrgyzstan exceeded 42 times. Kyrgyzstan has three times more livestock than West Germany and six times more than Japan. The power generation capacity of power plants built in Kyrgyzstan in the past 30 years has increased by 770 times compared with 1917.

In terms of the number of university graduates, Uzbekistan alone has an average of 81 university graduates per 10,000 people, which is twice as high as France, seven times as high as Turkey, and 28 times as high as Iran. Uzbekistan has 36 universities, 150,000 experts with higher and secondary education, 200 doctors of science, and 2,100 associate doctors. In Turkmenistan, one out of every four people is a student. Kyrgyzstan has 10,000 female teachers at all levels.

These achievements were obtained after many fierce class struggles; in the struggle against bourgeois nationalism and separatism. It has experienced many difficulties and obstacles, and attacked and overcome various incorrect ideas. As the resolution of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on preparing for the celebration of the 40th anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution pointed out: "The great October Socialist Revolution gave a severe blow to bourgeois ideology, the ideology of opportunism and reformism within the workers' movement, social chauvinism and reactionary nationalism; it realized the great principles of proletarian internationalism, revolutionized the thinking of the working people of all countries, and raised the world workers' movement and the national liberation movement to a new stage." The cruel war tested it, and the heroic spirit shown by Hitler's Germany in the barbaric war of aggression against the Soviet Union and the Soviet people in the years of the Great Patriotic War demonstrated to the people of the world the powerful strength generated by the Soviet Union's correct national policy.

Today, on the eve of the fortieth anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution, the Soviet Union has obtained a major invention in human history, opening up a new era in science and technology, taking the lead in manufacturing intercontinental ballistic rockets and artificial satellites. This new invention further proves that the socialist system has incomparable advantages over the capitalist system. It gives great excitement and encouragement to the peace-loving people all over the world and the people who are struggling for their own national liberation. At the same time, it gives a painful blow and a severe warning to the warmongers. This is tantamount to icing on the cake for the 40th anniversary of the revolution.

For nearly a hundred years, the minority nationalities who have suffered from cruel oppression and exploitation by imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism under the reactionary regime have obtained true equality and become members with full rights of this big family since the day the People's Republic of China's friendly and cooperative family was established. Under the brilliant light of Mao Zedong's national policy based on the principles of Marxist-Leninist national policy, we are moving towards a happy new life. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, Chairman Mao Zedong, and the Central People's Government, and with the fraternal help of the great Han people, very significant development has been achieved in the short span of eight years in terms of politics, economy, and the development of socialist content in national forms of culture. Today, new writing systems based on the Latin alphabet have been formulated for the sixteen ethnic groups who have been without written language and without learning in their own national languages under the oppression of the reactionary government, and writing systems will also be formulated for other ethnic groups recently. Today, more than 80% of school-age children in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region are studying. The number of health department cadres has increased 23 times compared with ten years ago. The total industrial output value in 1956 increased 3.35 times compared with 1952, and the number of livestock increased more than 2 times compared with 1947. The number of primary school students in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region has more than doubled compared with 1949, the number of university and middle school students has increased 8.8 times, the total industrial output value has increased 61 times compared with 1949, and the power generation has increased 71 times. This development is also a victory for the road of the great October Socialist Revolution. These victories are also inseparable from the great Soviet people's fraternal and selfless assistance to the Chinese people in the spirit of internationalism. Therefore, when we commemorate and celebrate the 40th anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution, we should learn from the advanced experience of the great Soviet people and their experience in fighting against various erroneous ideological tendencies. All minority nationalities in our country should further strengthen the iron-like unity, unite more closely and more firmly around the Chinese Communist Party, Chairman Mao Zedong, and the Central People's Government, and further strengthen our struggle for the victorious completion of the sacred tasks of socialist transformation and building a socialist society. We must resolutely fight against any erroneous ideological local nationalism and great Han chauvinism tendencies within us and the anti-Party, anti-socialist, and anti-people rightists to pave the way and further consolidate our path to building a socialist society. We must strive to further consolidate the socialist camp headed by the great Soviet Union. The emergence of the world socialist system, the victorious progress of various constructions in the socialist camp, the ever-rising national liberation movement in colonial countries, the overthrow of the colonialist system, the growing strength of the workers' movement, and the existence of new progressive forces—parties armed with Marxist-Leninist theory—are all the result of the development of the socialist camp advancing on the road of the great October Socialist Revolution. This also proves that no reactionary force can stop this objective law of social development.

Today, as we commemorate and celebrate the 40th anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution with infinite excitement, we sincerely congratulate the great Soviet Union, the pillar of the world's peaceful, democratic and socialist camp, on its growing prosperity and the growing happiness of the people of all nationalities in the Soviet Union.

Long live the victory of the great October Socialist Revolution!
Long live the cause of liberation of the oppressed people all over the world!
Long live the great Marxism-Leninism!
Long live the unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people!

    马克思列宁主义民族政策的胜利
    包尔汉
    值此伟大的十月社会主义革命四十周年到来的时候，我们和伟大的苏联人民一起以无比愉快和骄傲的心情来纪念和庆祝这个节日。因为伟大的十月社会主义革命在全世界历史上首次推翻了沙皇反动统治，树立了无产阶级专政的政权。它使得把人当商品出卖的资本主义社会趋于崩溃，开辟了建设人类多年来所盼望的自由、幸福的社会主义社会的时代，同时给殖民地国家的人民和所有遭受着各种社会与民族压迫的人民指出了民族解放的道路。它使国际工人运动受到了深刻的影响，成为无产阶级革命时代的开端，并且使全世界被压迫的无产阶级掌握了无比坚强的和科学的武器——马克思列宁主义。
    伟大的十月社会主义革命深深地影响了亚洲和其他国家被压迫人民的解放斗争。孙中山先生曾于1924年11月23日这样说过：“中国同俄国革命，都是走一条路。所以中国同俄国不只是亲善，照革命的关系，实在是一家。”毛泽东主席在“论人民民主专政”这一篇具有历史意义的文章中曾经这样说：“十月革命一声炮响，给我们送来了马克思列宁主义。十月革命帮助了全世界的也帮助了中国的先进分子，用无产阶级的宇宙观作为观察国家命运的工具，重新考虑自己的问题。走俄国人的路——这就是结论。”因而我们可以说中国人民革命的胜利也就是伟大的十月社会主义革命胜利的继续。
    苏联是个多民族的国家，有六十多个民族。在伟大的十月社会主义革命以前，这些民族大多数都是非常落后的，甚至还存在着一部分处于家长氏族时代的部落。若干年来反动政权和封建主的压迫剥削给他们遗留下了沉痛创伤和沉重的负担。为了医治这些创伤是需要进行很多艰巨的工作的。伟大的列宁在这样复杂的多民族的俄国，为了解决民族问题，曾创立了民族问题马克思主义的科学理论。当伟大的十月社会主义革命获得胜利后，苏联政府就立刻开始执行列宁这一个马克思主义无产阶级国际主义的民族政策。1917年11月15日由列宁斯大林等同志签署公布了关于“俄国各族人民权利宣言”。这个宣言不但反映了几百年来被压迫的劳动人民
  的愿望，而且也是表明各民族人民的平等权利和自由发展的不能变更
  的法律。同时这个宣言也向被压迫的各民族人民证明了如果不推翻封建地主剥削阶级和资产阶级政权，就不可能取得民族解放，只有社会主义才能使各民族人民摆脱压迫和
  剥削。
      在苏联共产党和苏联政府的领导下，由于列宁的这一民族政策的正确执行，以及伟大俄罗斯人民对各少数民族帮助的结果，四十年来，生活在苏联大家庭中的六十多个民族的人民，在政治、经济、文化等各方面已获得巨大发展，伟大苏联已成为各族人民团结友爱的大家庭，现在那里再没有落后的人民了。哈萨克、乌兹别克、吉尔吉斯、塔吉克和土库曼等共和国，在十月社会主义革命前是比较落后的。在苏联共产党和苏联政府领导下，由于实行了列宁的民族政策和得到伟大的俄罗斯人民兄弟般的帮助，现在这些地方的文化教育和工业都大大超过了亚洲各个邻近的资本主义国家。比如：根据各种统计材料以1956年的工业生产量和1913年的对比，则哈萨克超过了三十六倍，乌兹别克超过了十四倍，塔吉克超过了二十七倍，吉尔吉斯超过了四十二倍。柯尔克孜斯坦的牲畜比西德的牲畜多三倍，比日本多六倍。柯尔克孜斯坦三十年来建立的发电厂发电能力，比1917年增加七百七十倍。
    以大学毕业的人数来看，仅仅乌兹别克由大学毕业的人，平均每一万人中就有八十一个人，也就是说这个数目比法国高两倍，比土耳其高七倍，比伊朗高二十八倍。乌兹别克斯坦有大学三十六所，有高等和中等程度的专家十五万人，各种科学博士二百人，副博士达到二千一百名。土克明斯坦每四人中就有一个在学学生。柯尔克孜斯坦有各级女教员一万名。
    这些成绩都是在经历了很多激烈的阶级斗争而获得的；在向资产阶级民族主义、分裂主义的斗争中获得的。它经历了许多艰难和障碍，打击并战胜了各种不正确的思想。
  正如苏共中央关于筹备庆祝十月社会主义革命四十周年的决议中所指
  出的：“伟大的十月社会主义革命给资产阶级思想、工人运动内部的机会主义和改良主义的思想，给社会沙文主义和反动的民族主义以严重的打击；它实现了伟大的无产阶级国际主义原则，对各国劳动人民的思想起了革命化的影响，把世界工人运动和民族解放运动提高到了新的阶段。”残酷的战争考验了它，在希特勒德国对苏联挑起的野蛮的侵略战争和苏联人民在伟大的卫国战争年代里所表现的英雄气概，在世界人民面前说明了苏联正确的民族政策所产生的强大力量。
    今天在十月社会主义革命四十周年的前夕，苏联获得了人类历史上重大的发明，在科学技术方面开辟了新的时代，领先制造出洲际弹道火箭和人造卫星，这个新的发明进一步地证明了社会主义制度比资本主义制度有着无比的优越性，它给予全世界爱好和平的人民和为了自身的民族解放而进行着斗争的人民以极大的兴奋与鼓舞，同时也给战争贩子们以沉痛的打击和严厉的警告。这无异是给革命四十周年纪念日锦上添花。
    近百年来在反动政权之下备受帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义残酷压迫和剥削的少数民族人民，自从中华人民共和国友爱合作的大家庭成立的那天起，获得了真正的平等，成为这个大家庭拥有充分权利的成员。我们已经在基于马克思列宁主义民族政策原则的毛泽东民族政策的光辉照耀下，向着幸福的新的生活迈进。在中国共产党、毛泽东主席、中央人民政府领导下和伟大的汉族人民兄弟般帮助下，在政治、经济和发展民族形式社会主义内容的文化方面，短短的八年过程中获得了非常重大的发展。今天已经给在反动政府压迫下一直没有文字的和没有用本民族语言学习的十六个民族以拉丁字母做基础制定了新的文字，还有其他一些民族最近也将给他们制定文字。现在内蒙古自治区学龄儿童的百分之八十以上都在学习。卫生部门干部比十年前增加了二十三倍。1956年工业总产值比1952年增加了三点三五倍，牲畜比1947年增加了两倍多。新疆维吾尔自治区小学生比1949年增加了一倍多，大学和中学学生增加了八点八倍，工业总产值比1949年增加了六十一倍，电力增加了七十一倍。这种发展也是伟大的十月社会主义革命道路的胜利，这些胜利也是和伟大的苏联人民以国际主义精神给予中国人民兄弟般的无私帮助分不开的。因此我们在纪念和庆祝伟大十月社会主义革命四十周年的时候，应该学习伟大苏联人民的先进经验和他们与各种错误思想倾向作斗争的经验。我们全国各少数民族应该进一步加强钢铁般的团结，更紧密地和更加巩固地团结在中国共产党毛泽东主席和中央人民政府的周围，进一步加强我们为胜利完成社会主义改造和建设社会主义社会的神圣任务而进行的斗争。我们要和在我们内部妨害民族团结的任何错误思想地方民族主义和大民族主义倾向和反党反社会主义反人民的右派分子进行坚决的斗争，来铺平和更加巩固我们建设社会主义社会的道路。要为进一步巩固以伟大苏联为首的社会主义阵营而努力。世界社会主义制度的产生，社会主义阵营中各项建设的胜利进展，殖民地国家民族解放运动的日益高涨，殖民主义制度的被推翻，工人运动的成长壮大，新的进步力量——以马克思列宁主义理论锻炼武装起来的政党的存在，这些都是在伟大十月社会主义革命道路上前进着的社会主义阵营发展的结果。这也是证明任何一种反动势力也阻挡不住这个社会发展的客观规律。
    今天我们以无限兴奋的心情来纪念和庆祝伟大十月社会主义革命四十周年时，我们衷心祝贺全世界和平民主与社会主义阵营的支柱——伟大苏联日益繁荣和苏联各民族人民幸福生活的日益增长。
    伟大十月社会主义革命胜利万岁！
    全世界被压迫人民解放事业万岁！
    伟大的马克思列宁主义万岁！
    中苏两国人民牢不可破的友谊万岁！
