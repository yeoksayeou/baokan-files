Xinhua News Agency, 16th. According to a report by the United Press, U.S. Representative Sander, a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, told United Press reporters that President Sukarno said when he received him at the Bogor Presidential Villa on the 15th, the emergence of intercontinental missiles has rendered the Manila Treaty Organization and other military treaties ineffective.

Sander, who is currently active in Asia, also said that President Sukarno said that the successful launch of artificial satellites was another "victory" for the Soviet Union, which is related to the development of long-range missiles.

Sander said President Sukarno pointed out to him that the Soviet Union supports Indonesia's demand to recover West Irian, but the United States has not indicated that it will stand on that side.

    苏加诺总统向美一参议员说
    洲际导弹使马尼拉条约失效
    新华社16日讯  据合众社报道，美国众议院外交委员会委员桑德对合众社记者说，苏加诺总统15日在茂物总统别墅接见他的时候说，洲际导弹的出现已经使马尼拉条约组织和其他军事条约失去作用。
    正在亚洲进行活动的桑德还说，苏加诺总统说，发射人造卫星成功是苏联的“另一次胜利”，这同远程导弹的发展是有联系的。
    桑德说，苏加诺总统向他指出，苏联是支持印度尼西亚收复西伊里安的要求的，但是美国没有表明要站在那一方面。
