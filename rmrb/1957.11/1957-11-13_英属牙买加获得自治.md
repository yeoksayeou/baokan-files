Xinhua News Agency, Kingston, 12th—Jamaica achieved self-government on November 11, becoming the first country in the British West Indies colonies to do so.

    The new Jamaican government, composed of eleven ministers and a chief minister, was sworn in on the same day. The cabinet of the new government has been renamed the Council of Ministers, which will now be presided over by Chief Minister Manley instead of the Governor. However, two members of the Legislative Council, nominated by Manley and approved by the Governor, one of whom is British, will participate in the Council of Ministers as ministers without portfolio.
