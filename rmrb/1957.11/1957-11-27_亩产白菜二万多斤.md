    Cabbage Yield of Over 20,000 Jin Per Mu
    After the wheat harvest, the Ziyuan Agricultural Cooperative in Junxian, Henan, planted 126 mu of Chinese cabbage, including 10 mu of high-yield land. Due to the implementation of scientific management of the vegetable fields, increased fertilization, and rational irrigation, this year a total of 2.87 million jin of cabbage were harvested, with an average yield of 22,500 jin per mu. The high-yield land yielded 26,000 jin per mu, more than three times the average yield per mu in 1951. (Ruizhi)

    亩产白菜二万多斤
    河南浚县自愿农业社在麦收后种了大白菜一百二十六亩，其中有丰产地十亩。由于对菜地实行了科学管理，增施肥料和合理浇水，今年共收了白菜二百八十七万斤，平均亩产二万二千五百斤，丰产地每亩产菜二万六千斤，比1951年每亩平均增产三倍多。（瑞智）
