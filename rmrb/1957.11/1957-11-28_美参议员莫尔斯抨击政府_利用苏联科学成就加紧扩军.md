Xinhua News Agency, Washington, November 26th, TASS: US Senator Morse delivered a speech in Boston these days, sharply criticizing the US government for trying its best to use Soviet scientific and technological achievements to defend its tense arms race.

Morse said that the impact of Soviet-launched artificial satellites on the people of the world is not due to their military significance, but because these achievements have opened a new era for mankind. However, the US President and Secretary of State insist on viewing these achievements as a "military threat." Millions of people in neutral countries, even our friends, are not interested in them in the sense of the military value of satellites and rockets. They are interested in and curious about the new realm of interstellar space and the situation of mankind conquering this space. However, the government mainly focuses on the military aspect and concentrates its foreign policy on military assistance and military alliances.

According to Morse, the President's remarks are not convincing at all. He said that the worst thing is that when Western countries suffer a complete defeat in front of socialist countries, Eisenhower still has to put on a brave face.

Morse continued, the US government finally admitted that we have great shortcomings in the work of scientists, engineers and mathematicians. However, the President did not propose any effective "remedies" in his speech on scientific significance.

### 美参议员莫尔斯抨击政府  利用苏联科学成就加紧扩军

    美参议员莫尔斯抨击政府
    利用苏联科学成就加紧扩军
  　据新华社27日讯　据塔斯社华盛顿26日讯：美国参议员莫尔斯这几天在波士顿发表演说，尖锐地批评美国政府竭力利用苏联科学技术成就来为它进行紧张的军备竞赛辩护。
    莫尔斯说，苏联发射的人造卫星对世界人民产生影响并不是因为它们具有军事意义，而是由于这些成就为人类开辟了新纪元。可是美国总统和国务卿偏偏把这些成就看作是“军事威胁”。千百万中立国家的人民，甚至我们的朋友，都并不是在卫星和火箭的军事价值的意义上对它们感到兴趣的。他们感到兴趣和好奇的是星际空间的新境界以及人类征服这个空间的情况。可是政府却主要在军事方面着眼，把对外政策集中在军事援助和军事联盟方面。
    据莫尔斯说，总统的谈话一点也不能令人信服。他说，最糟的是，当西方国家在社会主义国家面前遭到彻底失败时，艾森豪威尔还要打肿脸充胖子。
    莫尔斯继续说，美国政府最后终于承认，我们在科学家、工程师和数学家的工作方面有着极大的缺点。可是总统在那篇关于科学意义的演说中却没有提出任何“对症下药”的有效方法。
