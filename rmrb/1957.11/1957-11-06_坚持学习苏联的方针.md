    Adhere to the Policy of Learning from the Soviet Union
    Yang Xiufeng
    The great October Socialist Revolution is now forty years old. Over the past forty years, the Soviet people have achieved brilliant accomplishments in the cause of socialist construction. These achievements fully demonstrate the unparalleled superiority of the advanced socialist system of the Soviet Union, pointing out the path for the working people of the world to strive for complete liberation and build a better life. The tremendous achievements of the Soviet Union's higher education and the rapid development of science and technology over the past forty years also provide the best example for all fraternal countries to learn from.
    Learning from the Soviet Union is our unwavering policy for building socialism. Continuing to learn from the advanced experience of Soviet higher education construction and the advanced science and technology of the Soviet Union is the best way for our higher education sector to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution, and also the most powerful counterattack against the frantic anti-Soviet, anti-communist, and anti-socialist attacks launched by a small handful of right-wing elements in the higher education sector in the previous period.
    Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, we have followed the instructions of the Party and the government to implement the policy of learning from the Soviet Union in higher education. At the National Education Work Conference at the end of 1949, the task of learning from the experience of Soviet education construction was proposed. Subsequently, Renmin University of China and Harbin Institute of Technology, modeled after Soviet higher education institutions, were established as pioneers for higher education institutions across the country to learn from Soviet experience. In 1952, after ideological remolding of teachers nationwide, we further reformed departments and specialties in higher education institutions nationwide with reference to the construction experience of Soviet higher education. On this basis, we universally carried out the work of learning from Soviet advanced experience to reform teaching.
    Due to a series of reforms carried out in recent years, fundamental changes have taken place in higher education in our country. A new socialist higher education system has been established. Marxist-Leninist thought has established a leading position in higher education institutions. The children of workers and peasants, who were rarely able to enter higher education institutions in the past, now account for a certain proportion of students in higher education institutions, accounting for about 20% in several large cities, and 34.1% for higher education institutions nationwide. All higher education institutions have undergone departmental adjustments, and the distribution of departments is gradually becoming more rational. All types of schools have established specialties and formulated teaching plans that reflect the goals of specialty training. All courses have teaching syllabuses issued by the Ministry of Higher Education or self-determined by the schools. These teaching syllabuses can generally implement a Marxist-Leninist worldview, reflect the level of modern science and technology, and ensure the requirements for training cadres. Translation of Soviet textbooks or self-compiled textbooks have been basically used in all subjects. Teaching links such as production internships, graduation theses, and graduation designs have also been universally carried out. All teachers have basically participated in teaching and research groups. New specialties and courses that never existed in the past are being opened one after another. The development of higher education in our country is proceeding according to the needs of national construction in a planned way. The number of cadres trained has increased significantly. In the past eight years, higher education institutions have trained 369,000 graduates for the country, which is 150,000 more than the total number of graduates in the fifty years before liberation. Graduates trained according to new teaching plans and teaching syllabuses have demonstrated a certain ability to link theory with practice and work independently in construction positions. All these achievements are inseparable from the active learning of Soviet advanced experience by the vast number of teachers under the correct leadership of the Party and the government.
    The reason why we have been able to achieve such results in learning from the Soviet Union in just a few years is that the Soviet government's dispatch of a large number of experts has played a significant role in helping us. In recent years, the Soviet government has sent a total of 583 outstanding experts to work in higher education institutions in our country. This academic year, another 117 experts have arrived or are about to arrive. These experts have helped us improve teaching, train teachers, and disseminate advanced educational experience and science and technology with great enthusiasm and selfless labor. According to incomplete statistics, by the first half of 1957, the experts had trained 8,285 graduate students and teachers for further studies. Experts opened new courses or helped courses with weak foundations to open 889 courses and guided Chinese teachers to teach 443 courses. By the end of 1956, experts had compiled 629 kinds of textbooks, of which 108 had been publicly published and distributed. They helped Chinese teachers establish 496 laboratories, 192 data rooms, and 34 internship factories. In addition, 36 experts gave lectures in 37 training courses, with 2,775 teachers participating in the study. During the first five-year plan, experts helped higher education institutions to newly establish 148 new specialties, including electronic computers and peaceful use of atomic energy, to train cadres in new science and technology. As for helping Chinese teachers establish teaching and research groups, revise teaching plans and teaching syllabuses, and guide graduation theses and graduation designs, it is even more difficult to count. The teaching experience and scientific and technological expertise disseminated by experts have taken root and borne fruit in the soil of higher education construction in China. It should be particularly pointed out that the sincere and selfless friendship, the noble qualities of hard work, and the great internationalist spirit of the experts have left an extremely deep impression among higher education workers in our country, and have also educated and influenced the younger generation in our country.
    In recent years, with the help of the Soviet government and Soviet experts, we have also obtained many valuable Soviet teaching materials. This has been of great help to us. Various teaching plans, teaching syllabuses, and other teaching documents have become important bases for teaching in higher education institutions in our country. The translation and adoption of Soviet textbooks in recent years have more timely solved the urgent needs of higher education institutions in teaching after the teaching reform, and have also played a great role in improving teaching content and improving teaching quality. According to statistics from the Ministry of Higher Education, from the beginning of 1952 to the end of 1956, a total of 1,393 translated versions of Soviet higher education textbooks were published, and translation is still being organized.
    Sending students to study in the Soviet Union and sending teachers to the Soviet Union for further study is another important link in our higher education to learn from the Soviet Union. From 1950 to the summer vacation of 1956, with the strong help of the Soviet government, our country sent a total of 6,288 students to study in the Soviet Union (including 1,088 graduate students and 5,200 undergraduates), of which about 75% studied science and engineering specialties. As of the summer vacation of 1957, 625 people have graduated and returned to China (189 graduate students and 436 undergraduates). Since 1955, a total of 225 teachers have been sent to the Soviet Union for further study. They have learned a lot of science and technology and gained a lot of experience in the Soviet Union, which has played or is playing a positive role in the development of socialist construction and higher education in our country.
    In addition, through cultural exchanges between the two sides, such as sending inspection groups, visits, etc., we have also learned a lot of Soviet experience. From the end of last year to the beginning of this year, the delegation of higher education workers from our country visited the Soviet Union for more than two months and gained even more. In May of this year, Soviet Minister of Higher Education Yelyutin accompanied Chairman Voroshilov on a visit to China, introduced the experience of Soviet higher education construction over the past 40 years to higher education workers in our country, visited many higher education institutions in our country, and donated a batch of books to us, which has had an important impact on the friendship and cooperation between China and the Soviet Union in higher education.
    In short, since the founding of the People's Republic of China, especially since the teaching reform in 1952, we have made great achievements in learning from the Soviet Union. Among the vast number of higher education workers in our country, actively learning from the Soviet Union has become a general trend.
    However, there are also a small number of bourgeois rightists in the higher education sector in our country. They firmly stand on the position of the bourgeoisie, oppose the transformation of old higher education institutions according to socialist principles, and oppose learning from the Soviet Union and reforming teaching in higher education. They boast of Anglo-American capitalist civilization and deny the advancement of Soviet science and technology. By opposing learning from the Soviet Union, they try to pull higher education in our country back to the old path of learning from the United Kingdom and the United States, and realize the restoration of bourgeois higher education. However, the vast number of teachers have fully realized the superiority of Soviet experience and the great achievements made by our country in learning from Soviet advanced experience from their own personal experience. Recently, the successful test of the Soviet intercontinental missile and the launch of artificial satellites once again have demonstrated the rapid progress and great achievements of Soviet science and technology to the people of the world. These iron facts have powerfully shattered the rumors of the rightists and strengthened the confidence of the vast number of teachers in learning from the Soviet Union.
    From the process of learning from the Soviet Union's advanced experience in building socialist higher education in recent years, we have gradually experienced that in order to build socialist higher education in our country, we must better learn from the Soviet Union in the following aspects in the future.
    The first is the ideological guidance of Marxism-Leninism and the leadership of the Party. I think this needs no further elaboration. It is not only reflected in the fact that the policies, policies, and various measures of Soviet higher education are formulated under the leadership of the Party and implement Marxist-Leninist principles, but also in the emphasis on political theory courses in higher education institutions, the implementation of the cultivation of students' dialectical materialism worldview and the elaboration of the Party's lines and policies in the teaching of various subjects, and the emphasis on students' political conditions in training goals. This is the most fundamental feature of socialist higher education that we must learn.
    The second is the class line of cultivating working-class intellectuals. After the success of the revolution, the Soviet Union adopted very resolute measures to implement the class line in higher education institutions, such as setting up worker departments in various higher education institutions, stipulating that students in worker departments should be given priority to enter university undergraduate courses, selecting outstanding party members and working cadres to enter higher education institutions, and actively developing spare-time education. Through these measures, the class composition of higher education students quickly changed, and the ranks of working-class intellectuals rapidly grew and expanded. At present, this experience is worthy of great attention for our country.
    The third is the teaching policy of linking theory with practice. Soviet higher education teaching pays great attention to the organic connection between theory and practice. It is reflected in the special emphasis on teaching links such as experiments, internships, course design, and graduation design, in the close combination of the arrangement of various production internships and theoretical teaching, in the attention to the use of practical materials of production struggle and class struggle in teaching, and in the enrichment of teaching content with new materials at any time, in the establishment of specialties and specialized courses, the close connection between basic theory and specialty course teaching, and so on. Recently, the Soviet Union has paid special attention to recruiting students with practical production training and work experience, stipulating that middle school graduates with more than two years of working experience should be given priority for admission, and is preparing to gradually transition to fully recruiting middle school graduates with practical production training and work experience, which is also an important measure to enable higher education students to better possess the ability to link theory with practice.
    In recent years, Soviet higher education institutions have emphasized reducing class hours, streamlining teaching content, strengthening the study of basic theories, and improving the organization of the teaching process in teaching, and cultivating students' independent working ability through various methods, which is of great significance for improving the quality of cadre training.
    The fourth is the educational goal of all-round development. Marxist-Leninist education has always aimed at cultivating the all-round development of people. Soviet higher education's requirements for training experts have always emphasized a scientific worldview and a revolutionary outlook on life, and the requirements for the political quality and professional conditions of cadres are equally important. As for professional education, it also pays great attention to carrying out on the basis of a wide range of general scientific and technological theories, in order to overcome the limitations of scientific division of labor brought about by the professionalization of higher education. We have long proposed a policy of all-round development in higher education. The Soviet Union's experience in this regard has very important reference value.
    The fifth is the principle of collectivism in teaching and scientific research. The Soviet Union's attention to giving play to collective strength in higher education institutions is a manifestation of democratic centralism in socialist countries. It is reflected in the fact that all work in the school is carried out in a planned way, and these plans are formulated by combining leadership and the masses, and it is also reflected in the fact that school teaching is carried out in accordance with teaching plans and teaching syllabuses. As for the collective leadership of the school and department's academic committees in teaching, scientific research and major administrative work; the teaching and research group organizes all teachers to give full play to collective strength on the basis of individual independent research to improve their professional level, improve teaching quality, and carry out larger scientific research work, which further demonstrates the characteristics of collectivism in Soviet higher education institutions.
    The sixth is to cultivate talents in a planned and specialized manner according to the needs of national construction. This feature is reflected in the preparation of cadre training plans adapted to the national economic plan, in the establishment and adjustment of specialties closely integrated with the needs of national construction, in the establishment of a higher education network, the rational deployment of the establishment and distribution of higher education institutions to adapt to the national economic layout, in the fact that teaching plans and teaching syllabuses must reflect and ensure certain specifications for training talents, and also in the fact that graduate students are assigned jobs by the state according to national needs, and so on. In this regard, we must learn from the Soviet Union.
    The seventh is the tradition of hard work and frugality in running schools. After the victory of the Soviet revolution, construction was carried out under extremely difficult material conditions, and hard work and frugality in running schools have become a fine tradition in higher education institutions. Their staff size is very tight, and the efficiency of administrative work is very high. The school buildings are generally very crowded, and the utilization rate is also very high. Many schools teach in a two-shift or even three-shift system. The experimental equipment has also reached the point of full utilization, and many equipment is manufactured by the school itself. This spirit of hard work in running schools was originally a fine tradition in our old liberated areas, but in recent years, the policy of building the country with diligence and thrift and running schools with diligence and thrift has not been fully implemented in higher education institutions in our country, and some extravagance and waste have grown. In the future, in learning from Soviet experience, we should carry forward the fine tradition of hard work in running schools in the old liberated areas.
    In addition, we must also learn from the Soviet Union in science and technology. Due to the backwardness of science and technology in old China, the foundation of many departments and disciplines in higher education institutions is very weak, and many new science and technology are still blank. To change this situation and cultivate cadres with modern scientific and technological level to serve socialist construction, we must and can only learn from the Soviet Union.
    We have made great achievements in learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union in recent years, which is certain and allows no doubt. However, in the process of learning, we also have shortcomings in that we do not understand the spiritual essence of Soviet experience deeply enough, and sometimes we mechanically apply it without combining it with China's actual situation. Chairman Mao taught us to "be good at learning from our advanced Soviet Union." We have not been able to do this very well.
    In the future, in order to further learn from the Soviet Union better, we must summarize the experience and lessons learned in the past learning process on the basis of the achievements we have made in recent years, study the historical development path of Soviet higher education construction more deeply, seriously learn from their various experiences in higher education, grasp its spiritual essence, and specifically apply it in combination with our country's actual situation. We must also actively learn from the Soviet Union's advanced science and technology, improve and enrich teaching content, establish and strengthen new scientific and technological specialties that are lacking or have a weak foundation in our country, so as to improve the teaching quality and scientific level of higher education institutions in our country.
    At present, there are two essentially completely opposed higher education routes in the world. One is the capitalist higher education represented by Anglo-American capitalist countries, which is needed by the bourgeoisie and whose main task is to train cadres to serve the interests of maintaining bourgeois rule. The other is the socialist higher education represented by the Soviet Union, which is needed by the broad masses of people and whose main task is to train cadres to serve the construction of socialist to communist society. The reform and development of higher education in our country in recent years has been carried out in the struggle against the capitalist higher education route and adhering to the socialist higher education route. The current main tasks are to further strengthen ideological education in Marxism-Leninism; implement the working-class and peasant class line, enroll more workers, peasants and their children, and at the same time strengthen the transformation of students from non-worker and peasant backgrounds, so as to cultivate a team of working-class intellectuals; strengthen labor education for students, so that students can receive a certain amount of physical labor training, overcome the remnants of exploiting class ideology, and develop a viewpoint of not fearing hardship and regarding labor as glory, so as to cultivate students into laborers with socialist consciousness, culture, and health; and mobilize all teachers, students, and staff to implement the policy of building the country with diligence and thrift and running schools with diligence and thrift, work hard, and actively strive to further improve the quality of higher education, so as to better adapt to the needs of China's socialist economic construction, so that socialist higher education in our country will achieve a complete victory in the struggle against the capitalist higher education route. In order to achieve this task, we must earnestly learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union in building socialist higher education and their advanced science and technology. This is the glorious task of all our higher education workers. When celebrating the 40th anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution, all our higher education workers should have a clearer understanding of this.

    坚持学习苏联的方针
    杨秀峰
    伟大的十月社会主义革命已经四十周年了。四十年来，苏联人民在社会主义建设事业中已经取得了辉煌的成就。这些成就，充分显示了苏联先进的社会主义制度无比的优越性，给全世界劳动人民指出了争取彻底解放、建设美好生活的道路。而苏联四十年来高等教育事业的巨大成就和科学技术的飞跃发展，也给各兄弟国家以最好的学习的榜样。
    学习苏联是我国建设社会主义坚定不移的方针，继续学习苏联高等教育建设的先进经验和苏联先进的科学技术，是我们高等教育界对于十月革命四十周年最好的纪念；对于前一个时期一小撮右派分子在高等教育界所发动的反苏、反共、反社会主义的猖狂进攻来说，也是最有力的反击。
    自从中华人民共和国一成立，我们就遵照党和政府的指示在高等教育事业中开始执行了学习苏联的方针，在1949年年底全国教育工作会议上，就曾提出了学习苏联教育建设的经验的任务。接着，创办了以苏联高等学校为榜样的中国人民大学和哈尔滨工业大学，作为全国高等学校学习苏联经验的先导。到1952年，在全国教师思想改造以后，更进一步地参照苏联高等教育建设经验，在全国高等学校中进行了院系调整、专业设置，并在这个基础上普遍开展了学习苏联先进经验进行教学改革的工作。
    由于几年来我们进行了一系列的改革工作，我国的高等教育已经起了根本的变化。新的社会主义的高等教育体系已经建立起来，在高等学校中马克思列宁主义的思想已经确立了领导地位；过去很少能够进入高等学校的工农子弟，现在在高等学校学生中已占到一定的比重，在若干大城市中已经占到20％左右，而就全国高等学校来说，已经占到34．1％；所有高等学校都已进行了院系调整，在设置分布上正在逐步趋向合理；各类学校都已设置了专业，并且制定了体现专业培养目标的教学计划；所有课程都已有了高等教育部颁发的指导性的或者各校自订的教学大纲，这些教学大纲一般都能贯彻马克思列宁主义世界观、反映现代科学技术水平和保证培养干部规格要求，各科教学中基本上都已有了苏联教材译本或自编教材；生产实习、毕业论文、毕业设计等教学环节也已普遍进行；所有教师基本上都已参加了教研组；过去从未有过的新专业和课程正在陆续开设；我国高等教育事业的发展正在按照国家建设需要有计划地进行，培养干部的数量有了巨大的增长，八年来，各高等学校已为国家培养了三十六万九千名毕业生，比解放前五十年中的毕业生总数还多十五万人；按照新的教学计划、教学大纲培养出来的毕业生，在建设岗位上已表现了一定的理论联系实际和独立工作能力。这一切成绩的取得，都是与广大教师在党和政府的正确领导下积极学习苏联先进经验密不可分的。
    我们之所以能够在短短几年内学习苏联取得这样的成绩，苏联政府派遣了大批专家对我们的帮助起了很大的作用。几年来，苏联政府共派遣了五百八十三位优秀的专家来我国高等学校工作，本学年已经来到或即将来到的还有一百一十七位专家。这些专家们以高度的热情、忘我的劳动帮助我们改进教学、培养师资、传播先进的教育经验和科学技术。仅据不完整的统计：到1957年上半年止，专家们已为我们培养了研究生和进修教师八千二百八十五人；专家们新开课程或帮助基础薄弱的课程开课已有八百八十九门，指导中国教师讲授的课程有四百四十三门；到1956年年底止，专家已编写教材六百二十九种，其中已公开出版发行一百零八种；帮助中国教师建立实验室四百九十六个，资料室一百九十二个，实习工厂三十四个；还有三十六位专家主讲开过三十七个训练班，参加学习的教师有二千七百七十五人；在第一个五年计划期间，专家帮助各高等学校新设立了包括电子计算机、和平利用原子能等培养新科学技术干部的缺门专业一百四十八种。至于帮助中国教师建立教研组，修订教学计划、教学大纲，指导毕业论文、毕业设计等更是难以数计。专家所传播的这些教学经验和科学技术特长，已经在中国高等教育建设的土壤里生根、结果。特别应该提出的是专家真诚无私的友谊，辛勤劳动的高贵品质以及伟大的国际主义精神，已经在我国高等教育工作者中间留下极其深刻的印象，也教育和影响了我国年青的一代。
    几年来通过苏联政府和各位苏联专家的帮助，我们还得到了很多宝贵的苏联的教学资料。这对我们有很大帮助。各种教学计划、教学大纲和其他教学文件，都已成为我国高等学校中进行教学的重要依据。几年来苏联教材的翻译和采用，更及时地解决了我国教学改革后高等学校教学上的迫切需要，对改进教学内容、提高教学质量也起了很大作用。根据高等教育部统计，自从1952年开始到1956年底，共出版了苏联高等学校教材译本一千三百九十三种，目前仍在组织翻译。
    派遣留学生去苏联学习和派遣教师到苏联进修，是我们高等教育中学习苏联又一重要环节。从1950年到1956年暑假，在苏联政府大力帮助下我国共派遣了留学生六千二百八十八人赴苏联学习（内研究生一千零八十八人，大学生五千二百人），其中学习理、工科专业的占75％左右。截至1957年暑假止，已经有六百二十五人毕业回国（研究生一百八十九人，大学生四百三十六人）。派遣教师赴苏联进修，从1955年开始，到现在共有二百二十五人，他们在苏联学得了许多科学技术，获得了许多经验，对我国社会主义建设事业和高等教育事业的发展已经起了或正在起着积极作用。
    此外，通过双方文化交流，如派遣考察团、参观、访问等，我们也学习了不少苏联经验。去年年底到今年初，我国高等教育工作者访苏代表团在苏联进行了两个多月的参观访问，收获更为丰富。今年5月，苏联高等教育部叶留金部长随同伏罗希洛夫主席访问中国，向我国高等教育工作者介绍了苏联四十年来高等教育建设的经验，访问了我国不少高等学校，赠送了我们一批书籍，对于中苏两国在高等教育方面的友好合作的增进，更有重要影响。
    总之，自从建国以来，特别是自从1952年在进行教学改革以来，我们在学习苏联方面已经取得很大成绩。我国广大高等教育工作者中间，积极学习苏联已经蔚为风气。
    但是，我国高等教育界也有一小撮资产阶级的右派，他们牢固地站在资产阶级的立场，反对按照社会主义的原则改造旧的高等学校，反对在高等教育中学习苏联、改革教学，他们夸耀英美资本主义文明，否定苏联科学技术的先进。他们借反对学习苏联，力图把我国的高等教育拉回向英美学习的老路，实现资产阶级高等教育的复辟。可是广大的教师从自己的亲身体验中已经充分认识到苏联经验的优越性和我国学习苏联先进经验所取得的伟大成绩。最近苏联洲际导弹的试验成功和一次再次人造卫星的发射，更在全世界人民中显示出苏联科学技术的飞跃进展和巨大成就。这些铁的事实有力地击破了右派分子的谰言，也更坚定了广大教师学习苏联的信心。
    从几年来学习苏联建设社会主义高等教育的先进经验过程中，我们逐步体验到为了建设我国的社会主义高等教育，今后必须更好地从以下几方面向苏联学习。
    第一是马克思列宁主义的思想指导和党的领导。这一点我想无须多加叙述，它不仅表现在苏联高等教育的方针、政策和各项措施都是在党的领导下贯彻马克思列宁主义原则制订的，而且也表现在高等学校对政治理论课的重视，在各科教学中贯彻对学生辩证唯物主义世界观的培养和党的路线方针的阐述，在培养目标上重视学生政治条件等等。这是我们必须学习的社会主义高等教育最根本的特点。
    第二是培养工人阶级知识分子的阶级路线。苏联在革命成功后对于在高等学校中贯彻阶级路线采取了十分坚决的措施，如在各高等学校设立工人系，规定工人系学生优先升入大学本科，挑选优秀党员和在职干部进入高等学校，积极开展业余教育等，通过这些措施，高等学校学生的阶级成分迅速起了变化，工人阶级知识分子的队伍迅速得到成长壮大。目前，这个经验对我国来说是十分值得重视的。
    第三是理论联系实际的教学方针。苏联高等学校教学中十分注意理论与实际的有机联系，它表现在对于实验、实习、课程设计、毕业设计等教学环节的特别重视，表现在各次生产实习的安排与理论教学的密切结合，表现在教学中注意生产斗争和阶级斗争实际资料的运用和随时吸收新的资料丰富教学内容，表现在专业和专门化课程的设置、基础理论与专业课程教学间的密切联系等等。最近，苏联特别注意招收具有生产实际锻炼和工作经验的学生入学，规定优先录取有两年以上工龄的中学毕业生，并且准备逐步过渡到完全招收具有生产实际锻炼和工作经验的中学毕业生，这也是为了使高等学校学生更好地具备理论联系实际能力的重要措施。
    近几年来，苏联高等学校在教学中强调减少学时，精简讲授内容，加强基础理论的学习，改善教学过程的组织工作，通过多种方式培养学生的独立工作能力，这对于提高培养干部的质量具有重要意义。
    第四是全面发展的教育目标。马克思列宁主义的教育从来是以培养人的全面发展为目标的。苏联高等学校对培养专家的要求从来就强调科学世界观和革命人生观，对干部的政治质量与业务条件的要求是并重的。至于在专业教育方面，也十分注意在广泛的一般科学技术理论的基础上进行，以克服由于高等教育专业化发展而带来的科学分工上的局限性。我们在高等教育中早已提出了全面发展的方针，苏联这方面的经验有很重要的参考价值。
    第五是教学工作和科学研究工作上的集体主义原则。苏联在高等学校中注意发挥集体力量是社会主义国家民主集中制的一种体现。它表现在学校一切工作都是有计划进行的，而这些计划都是由领导与群众相结合制定的，也表现在学校教学都是按照教学计划和教学大纲进行的。至于学校和系的学术委员会体现在教学工作、科学研究工作和重大行政工作上的集体领导；教研组组织所有教师在个人独立钻研的基础上充分发挥集体力量来相互提高业务水平、提高教学质量和进行较大的科学研究工作，更表现了苏联高等学校中集体主义的特点。
    第六是按照国家建设需要，有计划分专业的培养人才。这个特点表现在与国民经济计划相适应的培养干部计划的编制上，表现在与国家建设需要密切结合的专业设置和调整上，表现在高等学校网的建立、高等学校的设置分布适应国家经济布局的合理布署上，表现在教学计划、教学大纲要体现和保证培养人才的一定规格要求上，也表现在毕业学生按国家需要由国家分配工作上等等。在这方面我们是必须向苏联学习的。
    第七是艰苦奋斗、勤俭办学的传统。苏联革命胜利后，在物质条件极端困难下进行建设，艰苦奋斗，勤俭办学已成为高等学校中一种优良传统。他们的职工编制非常紧，而行政工作效率很高。校舍一般很挤，使用率也很大，许多学校是二部制、甚至三部制进行教学。实验设备也达到充分利用的地步，不少设备由学校自己制造。这种艰苦办学的精神，本来也是我们在老解放区的优良传统，但这几年来我国高等学校中贯彻勤俭建国、勤俭办学的方针不够，滋长了一些铺张浪费现象。今后应该在学习苏联经验中，对老解放区的艰苦办学的优良传统，加以发扬光大。
    此外，在科学技术上我们也必须向苏联学习。由于旧中国科学技术的落后，在高等学校中许多系科的基础十分薄弱，许多新的科学技术还是空白。要改变这种情况，培养具有现代科学技术水平、为社会主义建设服务的干部，我们必须而且也只有向苏联学习。
    我们这几年学习苏联先进经验取得了很大的成绩，这是肯定的，不容有任何怀疑的。但是我们在学习过程中也存在着对苏联经验的精神实质领会不够，了解不深，有时有机械搬用而结合中国实际不够的缺点。毛主席教导我们“要善于向我们先进者苏联学习”，我们还没有能够很好地做到这一点。
    今后，为了进一步地更好地学习苏联，我们必须在几年来已有成绩的基础上，总结过去学习过程中的经验教训，更深入地研究苏联高等教育建设历史发展的道路，认真地学习他们在高等教育方面的各项经验，掌握它的精神实质，结合我国实际情况具体地加以运用。还必须积极学习苏联先进的科学技术，改进和充实教学内容，建立和加强在我国缺门的或基础薄弱的新的科学技术专业，以提高我国高等学校的教学质量和科学水平。
    目前世界上存在着两条本质上完全对立着的高等教育路线。一条是以英美资本主义国家为代表的、为资产阶级所需要的、以培养为维护资产阶级统治利益服务的干部为主要任务的资本主义的高等教育，另一条是以苏联为代表的、为广大人民所需要的、以培养为建设社会主义到共产主义社会服务的干部为主要任务的社会主义的高等教育。我国几年来高等教育的改革和发展，就是在反对资本主义的高等教育路线，坚持社会主义的高等教育路线的斗争中进行的。当前的主要任务是进一步加强马克思列宁主义的思想教育；贯彻工农阶级路线，更多地吸收工人、农民和他们的子弟入学，同时加强对非工农出身学生的改造，以培养工人阶级的知识分子队伍；加强对学生的劳动教育，使学生得到一定的体力劳动的锻炼，克服剥削阶级思想残余，养成不怕艰苦、以劳动为光荣的观点，来培养学生成为有社会主义觉悟的有文化的身体健康的劳动者；并动员全体师生员工，贯彻勤俭建国、勤俭办学的方针，艰苦奋斗，积极努力，以进一步提高高等教育的质量，更加适应我国社会主义经济建设的需要，使我国社会主义的高等教育在与资本主义高等教育路线作斗争中取得彻底的胜利。为了实现这一任务，我们就必须认真地学习苏联建设社会主义高等教育的先进经验和他们的先进的科学技术。这是我们全体高等教育工作者的光荣任务。在庆祝伟大的十月社会主义革命四十周年的时候，我们全体高等教育工作者对此应该更有明确的认识。
