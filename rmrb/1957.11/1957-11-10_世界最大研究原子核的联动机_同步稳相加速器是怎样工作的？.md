Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 8th: The news that the largest and most famous joint machine for studying atomic nuclei in Dubna, near Moscow – a synchrophasotron capable of accelerating protons to an energy of 10 billion electron volts – started operating in the spring of 1957, has spread throughout the world. How this giant machine, which far exceeds everything that mankind has created so far in accelerator technology, works is a matter of concern to many readers.

The TASS science commentator wrote after visiting Dubna:

We walked past many experimental buildings of the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research and turned onto a straight concrete avenue that led directly to a circular building, the photo of which has been published in newspapers and is already familiar to everyone.

A red and green traffic light is installed at the entrance, almost exactly like the traffic lights at intersections. The red light indicates that the machine is working. The yellow light indicates that there is still ionizing radiation in the room that prevents outsiders from entering. Only the green light indicates that people are allowed to enter the room containing the synchrophasotron.

While the machine was stopped, we entered a bright circular hall. A ring-shaped electromagnet occupied the entire circumference of the hall. Dozens of powerful pumps made a uniform sound. These pumps continuously extracted air from the ring-shaped vacuum chamber of the accelerator. Engineers were checking many relays that controlled the vacuum and cooling systems. Here, electronics experts had the heaviest workload. People continuously changed the magnetic and electric fields to control the movement of protons. This alternating process of change is indeed astonishingly rapid and accurate. Because the speed of protons in the accelerator is close to the speed of light, which is close to 300,000 kilometers per second. Only modern electronics can guarantee such rapid and accurate operation.

In the spring, when the synchrophasotron started operating, only operators could be seen in this building. Now, physicists conducting experiments occupy an important position here. The former's task is to supply the accelerated particle beam. The latter's task is to use it to bombard the nuclei of the substances being studied, to photograph and study the processes that occur as a result of this bombardment. We saw that during the pauses in the accelerator's operation, physicists determined the so-called targets in the path of the proton beam. Then, these targets were hit by particles accelerated to cosmic energy and speed.

The strong loudspeaker, which was originally inconspicuous, suddenly spoke. The engineer on duty loudly advised everyone to leave the building. The machine here is about to start. The inevitable ionizing radiation makes it impossible to stay in the accelerator building, or even near the building.

We went with the staff managing the accelerator to a power room hundreds of meters away from the accelerator building. This spacious control room issued "commands" to the accelerator's numerous devices. The accelerator's operation was observed remotely from here.

The engineer on duty in the control room gave instructions to his assistants by telephone. The signal lights on the indicator panel lit up. These signals indicated the working status of the electromagnetic winding cooling and the degree of vacuum in the room. Finally, the sound of "Cycle start!" was heard. This means that hydrogen nuclei – protons – were injected into the ring chamber and began to run wildly there. In one acceleration cycle lasting a few seconds, the distance they traveled was equal to the distance from the Earth to the Moon, and then they bombarded the target at an extremely high speed, breaking the nuclei of the substance being studied, thereby causing the movement of particles and new nuclear reactions.

Professor Blokhintsev, Director of the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research, said: The greater the energy of the accelerated particles, the greater the possibility for physicists to deeply explore the mysteries of the microcosm. He added that, therefore, it should be acknowledged that in this sense, the scientists of the twelve member countries of the Joint Institute have the best conditions for carrying out fruitful work. According to the proposal of the inventor of this type of machine, the Soviet scientist Veksler, and the synchrophasotron made under his leadership, can make the particle energy reach 10 billion electron volts, which is 3.5 billion electron volts greater than the particle energy of the largest existing accelerator in the United States.

In answering the question of how to determine the energy of accelerated particles, Professor Blokhintsev said: There are two methods: according to the instructions of high-mass instruments and according to the nuclear reactions caused by accelerated particles. For example, what you are seeing now is a photomicrograph of the consequences of accelerated protons hitting silver nuclei. After studying this photo, any Soviet physicist or foreign physicist can determine that only protons with an energy of 9 billion to 10 billion electron volts can cause this reaction.

Currently, scientists are using the synchrophasotron to conduct research using thick-layer photographic emulsion methods. They have obtained many interesting scientific results of nuclear interaction at high energies. These results will be published. At the same time, work is being systematically carried out to increase the intensity of the proton beam. Equipment for new experiments is currently being manufactured.

In the future, it is planned to expand the scope of exploration to discover new particles that scientists do not yet know. Extensive experiments will be conducted to study the properties and interactions of "fundamental" particles.

    世界最大研究原子核的联动机
    同步稳相加速器是怎样工作的？
    新华社9日讯　塔斯社莫斯科8日电：1957年春天，莫斯科附近杜布诺城最大的一个著名的研究原子核的联动机——能把质子加速到具有一百亿电子伏特能量的同步稳相加速器开始运转，这个消息传遍了全世界。这个远远超过人类至今为止在加速器技术方面所创造的一切成就的巨大机器是怎么工作的，这是许多读者关心的问题。
    塔斯社科学评论员在访问了杜布诺城以后写道：
    我们走过了联合原子核研究所的许多实验大楼，转入一条一直通到一个圆形的建筑物的、笔直的混凝土大道，这个建筑物的照片曾经在报上发表过，大家已经很熟悉了。
    门口装着一个红绿信号灯，差不多同十字街头的红绿灯一模一样。红灯表示机器正在工作。黄灯表示室内尚有妨碍外人入内的电离作用。只有绿灯才表示允许人们进入装有同步稳相加速器的房间内。
    乘机器停歇的时候，我们走进了一座明亮的圆形大厅。环形电磁铁占据了整个大厅的四周。数十个力量强大的唧筒发出均匀的声音。这些唧筒不断地从加速器的环形真空室中抽出空气。工程师们正在检查许多控制真空和冷却系统的继电器。在这里，电子学专家们的工作最为繁重。人们使磁场和电场不断变化，以控制质子运动。这种变化的交替过程确实是要惊人的迅速和准确的。因为，质子在加速器中的运动速度接近于光速，即接近于每秒三十万公里。只有现代的电子学才能保证这样迅速和准确的操作。
    春天，同步稳相加速器开始运转的时候，这个大楼里只能看见操作人员。而现在，进行试验的物理学家在这里占了一个重要的地位。前者的任务就是供给加速的粒子束。后者的任务是用它来轰击被研究的物质的原子核，拍摄和研究由于这个轰击而发生的过程。我们看到了，在加速器工作的间歇时，物理学家们确定了质子束道路上的所谓靶子。接着，这些靶子就受到被加速到具有宇宙能量和速度的粒子的射击。
    本来不为人注意的强力的扩音器突然说起话来了。值班工程师高声建议大家离开这幢房屋。这里的机器马上就要开动了。必然要发出来的离子辐射使人无法在加速器大楼里逗留，连在挨近这个建筑物的地方停留都不行。
    我们同管理加速器的工作人员到离开加速器大楼数百公尺远的一座动力室去。这座宽敞的管理室向加速器的大量装置发出“命令”。从这里对加速器的工作进行远距离观察。
    管理室值班工程师用电话向自己的助手发指示。标示板的信号灯亮起来了。这些信号标示电磁绕组冷却的工作情况以及室内真空的程度。最后终于听到了“回旋开始！”的声音。这就是说，氢原子核——质子被射入了环形室，并且开始在那里猛烈奔跑。在历时几秒钟的一次加速回旋中，他们所跑过的路程就等于地球到月球的距离，随后就以极高的速度射击靶子。击破被研究的物质的原子核，从而引起粒子的运动和新的核反应。
    联合原子核研究所所长勃洛欣采夫教授说：加速粒子的能量愈大，物理学家深入探究微观世界奥秘的可能性就愈大。他补充说，因此应当承认，在这种意义上说，联合研究所十二个成员国的科学家有最好的条件进行卓有成效的工作。根据这类机器的发明者、苏联科学家维克斯列尔的主张和在他领导下制成的这个同步稳相加速器，可以使粒子能量达到一百亿电子伏特，这比美国现有的最大的加速器的粒子能量还要大三十五亿电子伏特。
    在回答如何确定加速粒子的能量的问题时，勃洛欣采夫教授说：有两种方法：根据质量很高的仪表的指示和根据加速粒子所引起的核反应。例如，你们现在所看见的是加速质子冲击银原子核的后果的显微照片。对这张照片进行研究以后，任何一个苏联物理学家或外国物理学家都能够确定：只有具有九十亿到一百亿电子伏特能量的质子才能引起这种反应。
    目前，科学家们正以厚层照相乳胶方法利用同步稳相加速器进行研究。他们获得了许多有趣的、在高能量下核相互作用的科学结果。这些结果将予以发表。同时正在有计划地进行提高质子束强度的工作。目前正在制造供新试验用的器械。
    今后打算扩大探究的工作面，以发现科学家还不知道的新粒子。将进行广泛的试验，来研究“基本”粒子的性质和相互作用。
