    Another group of cadres from provincial-level organizations in Guizhou set off on the 9th to participate in labor production in mountainous areas. This group of cadres consists of 1,105 people, including 94 cadres at or above the county level, and members of the Communist Party and the Communist Youth League account for more than 70%. The vast majority of them were assigned to the Weining Yi, Hui, and Miao Autonomous County, Huishui County in the Qiannan Buyi and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, and the mountainous agricultural cooperatives of seven counties including Guiding, Zunyi, Guizhu, Qingzhen, and Pingba to be commune members, eating, living, and working with the peasants.
    On the evening of the 8th, the Guizhou Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Guizhou Provincial People's Committee held a 2,000-person meeting to bid farewell to this group of cadres going up to the mountains and down to the countryside. Zhou Lin, First Secretary of the Guizhou Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Governor of Guizhou Province, said at the meeting that today more than a thousand comrades have actively responded to the call of the Third Plenary Session of the Party Central Committee and proactively requested to go to the mountains and the countryside, which is a very glorious thing and a revolutionary action. He asked the cadres going to the countryside to actively devote themselves to the upcoming high tide of agricultural production in the mountainous areas of the province, to carry out water conservancy, accumulate fertilizer, afforest, and eliminate the four pests with an innovative spirit, so that the mountainous areas become a happy paradise.
