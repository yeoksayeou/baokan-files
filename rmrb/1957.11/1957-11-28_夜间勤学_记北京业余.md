    Diligent Study at Night
    ——Notes on Beijing Evening Vocational College	　　　
    In a quiet place in the northern suburbs of Beijing, several simple bungalows are interspersed among towering red buildings. During the day, it is deserted. But as night falls, the place lights up brilliantly and fills with diligent students. This is the Beijing Evening Vocational College of Power. It is an independent evening polytechnic university sponsored by the Capital Construction Bureau of the Ministry of Electric Power Industry.

    This night university was established last year with only seven teachers and one hundred and thirty students. After more than a year, there are now seventeen teachers and two hundred and sixty-seven students. In terms of school buildings and teaching equipment, there are six relatively spacious classrooms, some of which can accommodate one hundred and fifty people at the same time, as well as a simple laboratory and a teaching and research office. The number of specialized courses has also increased from two to seven.

    The students studying here come from more than twenty units, including the Beijing Electric Power Design Institute of the Ministry of Electric Power Industry, the Petroleum Industrial Design Institute of the Ministry of Petroleum Industry, and the Coal Preparation Research and Design Institute of the Ministry of Coal Industry. In order to meet their work needs, the night university has established three majors: Thermal Power Plant Equipment, Power Plant Power Grids and Power Systems, and Industrial and Civil Construction.

    The development of the night university is advancing by constantly overcoming difficulties. The first difficulty encountered was the lack of teachers. There are not many teachers in many universities in Beijing, and in order to ensure that teachers have five-sixths of their time for research, their spare time is also strictly controlled. This made it difficult to hire teachers. Through the efforts of the school and the assistance of the Higher Education Department, especially the support of friendly universities, Professor Wang Shaoyan of Beijing Forestry College was invited to teach "Advanced Mathematics," and Professor Sun Zhentao of Beijing Institute of Technology was invited to teach "General Chemistry." These two courses were offered in the first semester after the start of school, but these two courses are the foundation of professional courses, and mastering these two courses is the key to mastering other professional courses. To learn general chemistry well, classroom teaching is not enough; experiments are essential. Where would the laboratory come from? This was another problem. Later, Beijing Normal University lent a laboratory, which solved the problem.

    The night university stipulates that four nights a week are for classes. Graduation takes six and a half years, and graduates are basically required to reach the level of regular university graduates. Such a long time and such strict requirements are a test for every student. Facts have proved that the vast majority of students can withstand the test. There is very little attrition, and they can all persevere in their studies. Among the newly enrolled students this year, some students' work units are located in Qinghe, and they have to travel more than twenty miles to attend classes every day. Regardless of wind or rain, they have never been absent from class without reason. Wang Zhen'an, a student from the Beijing Electric Power Design Institute, works as a design representative on a construction site in the Nanyuan District. It is dozens of miles from Nanyuan to the northern suburbs. He insists on cycling to class every day, and his academic score is 94.5. At the end of the semester, he received awards for both excellent academic performance and diligent study. Wang Dasheng, a second-year student majoring in thermal power plant equipment, is an assistant technician at the Electric Power Design Institute. He makes good use of his spare time for study, and he does not easily let go of Sundays. Sometimes, when he needs to go to other places for work, he uses the time on the train to do homework. Because he can make good use of his spare time, he received an award for excellent academic performance at the end of the semester. Wang Dasheng told me very modestly that his achievements are inseparable from the support of the leadership. Whenever he returns from a business trip, the leadership gives him time to make up for missed classes, and three to seven days to review before exams. With such excellent learning conditions, how can one not study hard! Wang Xiawei, a second-year student majoring in industrial and civil construction, told me that she was admitted to Beijing Evening Vocational College last year and will soon give birth. However, she insisted on studying until two hours before giving birth. After giving birth, she was always worried about missing classes and asked to attend classes only twenty days after giving birth. Her spirit of hard study was immediately supported by the school. In order to take care of her health, they sent a teacher to her home to tutor her. Therefore, at the end of the semester, she still achieved relatively good results.

    Such moving stories of learning are not isolated cases. We believe that soon they will become a vital force in the ranks of the working class intellectuals. (Attached picture)

    夜间勤学
    ——记北京业余	动力学院　　　张蕙萱
    在北京北郊的一个僻静的地方，四周高耸的红楼中间夹杂着几间简朴的平房。白天这儿没有人。每逢到夜幕降临的时分，这儿就亮起了辉煌的灯火，坐满了勤学的人们。这就是北京业余动力学院。它是电力工业部基本建设总局主办的一所独立的业余工科大学。
    这所夜大学是在去年成立的，开始只有教师七人，学员一百三十人，经过一年多的时间，现在已有教师十七人，学生二百六十七人。在校舍和教学设备方面，有六间比较宽敞的教室，有的能容纳一百五十人同时上课，还有一个简单的实验室和一个教研室。专业课程也由两门增加到七门。
    在这里学习的学员来自电力工业部北京电力设计分院，石油工业部石油工业设计院，煤炭工业部选煤研究设计院等二十多个单位。夜大学为了适应他们的工作需要，设立了热能动力装置、电站电力网及电力系统和工业建筑与民用建筑三个专业。
    夜大学的发展是在不断克服困难中前进的。首先碰到的困难就是师资缺乏，北京很多高等学校的教师也不多，又加上各校为了保证教师的六分之五的研究时间，业余时间也控制得比较严格。这就给聘请师资造成了困难。经过学校的努力和高等教育部的协助，特别是友邻高等学校的支援，请到了北京林学院王绍颜教授担任“高等数学”课，又请到北京工业学院孙振涛教授讲授“普通化学”课。在开学后的第一学期，就开设了这两门课，但是这两门课程是专业课的基础，学好这两门课是学好其他专业课的关键。要学好普通化学课程只靠课堂讲授是非常不够的，一定要有实验。实验室从那儿来呢？这又是一个难题。后来北京师范大学借给了一个实验室，才解决了这个困难。
    夜大学规定每周有四个晚上是上课时间，六年半毕业，毕业生基本上要达到正规大学毕业生的水平。这样长的时间，这样严格的要求，对每个学员来说都是一场考验。事实证明，绝大部分学员是经得起考验的，流动性很小，都能坚持学习。在今年新招收的学员中，有些学员的机关住在清河，每天上课要跑二十多里地，无论刮风下雨，从来没有无故旷课的。北京电力设计分院的学员王振安在南苑区工地做设计代表工作，从南苑到北郊有几十里的路程，每天骑自行车坚持上课，学习成绩是九十四点五分，在学期结束时，获得了成绩优秀和勤学双奖。在热能动力装置专业二年级学习的王大生是电力设计分院的助理技术员，在平时他能利用点滴的业余时间进行学习，就是星期日也不轻意放过。有时因工作需要到外地去，他就利用乘火车的时间做习题课。由于他能很好利用业余时间，所以在学期结束时获得了学习优秀奖。王大生很谦虚地告诉我，取得这样的成绩是与领导上的支持分不开的。每逢出差回来，领导上就给时间补课，考试前给三天到七天的时间复习功课，有这样优越的学习条件，怎能不好好学习啊！工业建筑与民用建筑专业二年级学员王霞薇告诉我，她在去年考取了北京业余动力学院，不久就要生产了。但她在临生产前的两小时还坚持学习，生产后，她一直耽心怕误了功课，在产后二十多天就要求上课。她这种刻苦学习的精神马上得到了学校的支持，为了照顾她的身体健康就派一位先生到她家补课。因此，在学期结束时，她还取得了比较好的成绩。
    像这些学习上的动人事迹并不是个别的。我们相信，不久，他们将成为工人阶级知识分子队伍中的生力军。（附图片）
