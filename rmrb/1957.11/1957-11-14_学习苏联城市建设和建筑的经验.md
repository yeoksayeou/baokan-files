Learning from the Soviet Union's Experience in Urban Construction and Architecture
Vice Chairman of the Architectural Society of China, Liang Sicheng

Chairman Mao said, "The October Revolution sent us Marxism-Leninism with a bang." In the early days after liberation, we (at least I personally) did not deeply appreciate the significance of this sentence. Over the past eight years, as each day passed and we achieved one victory after another in the socialist construction of our motherland, our understanding of Chairman Mao's words became more and more profound. The October Revolution marked the beginning of a new era in human history, a turning point for mankind. Today, the territory of socialist countries accounts for 26% of the world, and the population accounts for about 35% of the world's total. We, the People's Republic of China, are a proud member of this group. Without the October Revolution and the establishment of the Soviet Socialist Republics, the establishment of a socialist People's Republic in China today would be inconceivable.

The Soviet Union is the first country to achieve socialist victory. Over the past forty years, it has accumulated a wealth of experience. In the past eight years, the Soviet Union's selfless assistance in all aspects of our socialist construction has enabled us to achieve brilliant achievements in a short period of time. This is something that every Chinese person is deeply grateful for.

The Soviet Union's construction experience has become the most important example for socialist construction, including the experience in architecture and urban construction.

In the Soviet Union, urban planning is a continuation of the national economic plan and is carried out in coordination with the various major socialist and communist construction projects that are planned to develop production and improve the lives of the working people. Due to the elimination of class oppression and exploitation, and the elimination of private land ownership, it has become possible for the city to be planned, constructed, and managed as a whole. This is impossible under the capitalist system. Under these superior conditions, in the thirty-nine years since the revolution, the Soviet Union has built eight hundred and forty-eight new cities, and all the old cities have been rebuilt. Urban construction now has well-established design institutions, huge construction teams, efficient management agencies, and increasingly improved regulations, laws, quotas, and indicators. After the Second All-Union Congress of Architects, Soviet urban planning moved in a new direction: building satellite cities near some large cities, paying more attention to the greening and transportation of residential areas, and conducting theoretical research on community planning.

In terms of industrial construction, in recent years the Soviet Union has built more than eight thousand giant industrial enterprises, which is unmatched by any country in the world. The use of standardized designs has reduced design time by 30%-40%. Recently, research is being conducted on "universal standardized designs," which have been summarized into twenty-six sets of "universal" outline sketches. Typical designs for multi-story industrial buildings are also underway. The formulation of these standardized designs marks a new achievement in Soviet industrial architecture. By accelerating design and construction work, the requirement to increase the speed of industrial construction has been achieved.

In terms of residential construction, in a very short time after the October Revolution, the slums that were inevitable in capitalist cities were eliminated, and a large number of comfortable and beautiful workers' residential areas were built. In the ten years after the war alone, 300 million square meters of living space were built. During the Sixth Five-Year Plan period, another 205 million square meters will be built, which is about fourteen new houses per thousand urban residents each year. This is unimaginable in capitalist countries.

The reason why the Soviet Union can build on such a large scale and at such a rapid pace is mainly due to the adoption of design standardization and construction industrialization from a technical point of view. The Soviet Union is the only country in the world that has implemented standard design nationwide. In August 1955, the Central Committee of the CPSU and the Council of Ministers decided that from the second half of 1956, except for special exceptions, general civil buildings should use standard designs and factory-prefabricated components. This decision concretely reflects the advanced level of Soviet construction industrialization and the superiority of the socialist system.

The Soviet Union has made brilliant achievements in scientific research in architecture and urban planning. The Soviet Academy of Architecture and Construction is the most complete and advanced architectural scientific research institution in the world. In addition, many union republics and large cities also have scientific research institutions related to architecture and construction. Their work is theoretical work closely related to practice, publishing a large number of professional books and magazines, which plays a guiding role in Soviet urban construction and architecture.

Soviet architectural colleges and universities train approximately 450 architects for the country each year. They are all well-trained and competent architects. For the past two and a half years, Soviet architectural education has focused on standard design and the industrialization of components, and has been learning the most advanced construction methods. Students' training in engineering technology has been greatly strengthened. Many architects who have graduated recently are playing an important role in urban construction, both large and small.

The brilliant achievements made by the Soviet Union in urban construction and architecture have set an example for the architectural workers of New China and have inspired us. Learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union has long become a craze in the Chinese architectural community. Many of our cities and hundreds of industrial building enterprises have been planned, designed, and built with the help of Soviet experts and in the specific practice of learning from the Soviet Union. Guided by Marxism-Leninism and combining the advanced experience of the Soviet Union with China's actual conditions, socialist cities are gradually taking shape on our vast land. Today, China's new-type cities are also sent to us by "the October Revolution, a bang."

Take our great capital as an example. In 1949, the Soviet government sent an expert group headed by Comrade Abrasimov to help us with the planning of Beijing. In the following years, many experts came to help us. In 1954, another expert group headed by Comrade Bodrev was sent to help us. They unreservedly introduced to us the experience of socialist urban construction in the Soviet Union for more than 30 years. With their selfless assistance, our architectural workers—workers, architects, engineers, and administrative cadres—have brought into play great initiative. The face of our capital has been changing, and a new-type socialist people's capital is taking shape step by step.

The expert group headed by Comrade Bodrev, after arriving in Beijing in 1954, immediately conducted a comprehensive and in-depth investigation and study of all aspects related to the capital's urban planning. They helped us collect, analyze, and study information on Beijing's history and current situation, population, land, topography, geology, hydrology, climate, various buildings, roads, squares, transportation, rivers and lakes, greening, water supply and drainage, historical sites, cultural relics, industry, agriculture, and other issues. The overall plan of Beijing, as well as the road system, zoning, blocks, water system, water supply and drainage, heating, power supply, gas supply, transportation, and other plans, have completed preliminary long-term and short-term plans under the hard work of the experts. In the past few years, Beijing's planning has specifically guided more than 800 construction projects.

In addition to helping us with planning, the experts also helped us solve many specific problems. For example, the Beihai Bridge was rebuilt, the traffic in the eastern and western cities was improved, and the important cultural relics of Tuancheng were preserved, while also saving a large amount of investment. In addition to helping us formulate transportation planning, the experts also helped us greatly improve the trolleybus transportation in the capital, and also suggested and helped us overcome numerous difficulties to open up the ring line.

The experts helped us formulate water conservancy planning. During the investigation and research work, they even personally inspected the toilets, cesspools, and seepage wells of various bungalows. They taught our cadres to learn the method of using a small amount of sewage to irrigate farmland, and carried out scientific observation work on the sewage irrigation of farmers in Sanluju, so that the area of land using sewage has increased from 100 mu to 1,800 mu today. In addition to formulating the general water conservancy plan, they also guided us in the water diversion project of the Yongding River and the planning of the Qian San Men moat, as well as the preliminary design of the river waterworks, sewage treatment plants, and many sewer trunk lines.

In terms of architectural design and construction, the experts also gave us great help. First of all, they helped us strengthen the planned work of design, which ensured that drawings were issued on time. They helped us establish a drawing inspection system. The error rate of drawings has been significantly reduced, which has provided great convenience for construction.

In 1954, under the guidance of experts, we carried out the standard design of three- to four-story residential buildings, primary and secondary schools, single dormitories, and office buildings, and compiled atlases of prefabricated components and atlases of standard building components and door and window details. In addition to saving design manpower, the efficiency of factory processing and on-site construction has also been greatly improved.

In terms of structural design, in 1953, under the guidance of experts, we began to build multi-story brick and stone structures. At present, we have used brick and stone reinforced concrete mixed structures to reach ten stories. From 1953 to now, in the construction of 4 million square meters of houses, we have saved more than 50,000 tons of cement, more than 60,000 tons of steel, and a large amount of formwork timber. We must also mention that the expert group of the Ministry of Construction Engineering headed by Comrade Smirnov, the expert group of the Ministry of Urban Construction headed by Comrade Salyshev, the expert group of the Second Ministry of Machinery headed by Comrade Sterenla, and Comrade Semenov of the Ministry of Railways gave us great help, so that my country's industrial construction, urban construction, and railway construction have achieved brilliant achievements throughout the country. The design team of the Soviet Embassy headed by Comrade Rogin also gave us great help directly and indirectly.

In terms of architectural education, from 1952 to 1956, the Soviet government successively dispatched Academician Aseepkov, Professor Ilyichev, and Professor Afanchenko to Tsinghua University to help us carry out curriculum reform, formulate teaching plans and teaching syllabuses; help us establish and improve teaching and research groups, establish data rooms and laboratories; also helped us compile lecture notes, conduct graduation design and graduation defense; clarified our teaching direction and training goals. Today, we have begun to train well-rounded architects, and the teaching level and the level of students are improving year by year. Graduates of architectural departments of various colleges and universities across the country have played a huge role in the urban construction and architectural cause of the motherland.

Of course, the assistance of Soviet experts in the planning and urban construction and architectural education of our capital, as well as the planning and construction of many cities and emerging industrial towns across the country, is far more than these, but judging from the above-mentioned facts, limited to some facts in Beijing alone, it can be known that the brilliant achievements we have made in urban planning and construction in the eight years since liberation are inseparable from the selfless assistance of the Soviet people, the Soviet government, and Soviet experts.

In the eight years since liberation, the people of the whole country have responded to the call of the Party Central Committee with practical actions and resolutely learned from the Soviet Union. Under the wise leadership of the Party, with the specific help of the Soviet people, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Soviet government, and Soviet experts in China, and through the unremitting labor of the people of the whole country, we have achieved brilliant achievements in all fields of economic and cultural construction, including our urban construction and architectural work. However, since the rectification campaign began in May this year, especially in the early stage of the great blooming and contending, a small handful of reactionary right-wing elements have turned a blind eye to the facts and insisted that everything we do is "pitch black." They hate our socialist system, slander our Party, and slander our learning from the Soviet Union as dogmatism, in an attempt to fundamentally overthrow our social system and state system with these excuses and drag us back to the old road of capitalism. In the past six months, after the resolute counterattack of the people of the whole country, using the method of stating facts and reasoning, the right-wing elements have been refuted to the point of being speechless, and most of them have bowed their heads and confessed their crimes.

Today, as we celebrate this glorious festival here, in the Soviet Union, in China, and in all socialist countries, socialist cities are taking shape one by one, and the living conditions of hundreds of millions of working people are improving day by day. At the same time, Soviet artificial satellites are flying high in the sky, atomic energy power stations are supplying cheap electricity to the Soviet people, and the Tu-114 jet jumbo is shortening the diameter of the earth. In our country, the firecrackers and gongs celebrating the completion and opening of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge and the start of production of the three chemical plants in Jilin are still echoing in our ears. These are just a few of the most recent of countless achievements in the Soviet Union and China. All of this would be inconceivable without the great October Revolution, without the teachings and guidance of the great teacher Lenin, without the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Communist Party of China, without our superior socialist system, without the people's democratic state of the proletarian dictatorship, and without the guiding ideology of Marxism-Leninism. Let us cheer together with the 600 million people of the country, the Soviet people, and all good and upright people in the world to celebrate the glorious festival of the 40th anniversary of this great socialist revolution!

    学习苏联城市建设和建筑的经验
    中国建筑学会副理事长　梁思成
    毛主席说：“十月革命一声炮响，给我们送来了马克思列宁主义”。在解放初期，我们（至少我个人）对于这句话的意义是体会不够深刻的。八年来，一天一天过去，我们在祖国社会主义建设中取得了一个接着一个的胜利，对于毛主席这句话的体会也就一天比一天深刻。十月革命一声炮响为人类历史开始了新纪元，是人类历史的转折点。到今天，社会主义国家的领土已占全世界的26％，人口约占全世界的35％，我们中华人民共和国就是其中一个可以自豪的成员。没有十月革命和苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟的建立，今天在中国建立社会主义的人民共和国是不可思议的。
    苏联是第一个社会主义胜利的国家。四十年来，她已经积累了丰富的经验，八年来，苏联对于我们社会主义建设各方面无私的援助使我们能在短短的期间取得光辉成就，这是每一个中国人民所衷心铭感的。
    苏联的建设经验已经成了社会主义建设的最主要的借镜，其中也包括建筑和城市建设的经验。
    在苏联，城市规划是国民经济计划的继续，是与有计划地发展生产及提高劳动人民生活的各项巨大的社会主义共产主义建设配合进行的。由于消灭了阶级压迫和剥削，消灭了土地私有制，城市才有了可能作为一个整体来统一规划，统一建造，统一管理。这是在资本主义制度下不可能的。在这优越条件下，革命后三十九年中，苏联已经建设了八百四十八个新城市，所有的旧城市都得到改建。城市建设已经有完善的设计机构，巨大的建设队伍，有效率的管理机构，并且有日趋完善的规程、法令、定额、指标。在全苏建筑师第二次代表大会后，苏联的城市规划又向新的方向迈进：在一些大城市附近建造卫星城，更重视居住区的绿化和交通，并进行小区规划的理论探讨的工作。
    在工业建筑方面，最近几年苏联建造了八千个以上的巨型工业企业，这是世界上任何国家所没有的。由于采用了定型设计，缩短了设计时间30％—40％。近来正在研究“万能定型设计”，并且已经归纳为二十六套“万能的”轮廓草图。类似多层工业建筑的典型设计也在进行，这些定型设计的拟定，标志着苏联工业建筑的新成就。由于加速了设计和施工工作，因而达到了提高工业建设速度的要求。
    在居住建筑方面，十月革命以后，很短时间以内就消灭了资本主义城市中必不可免的贫民窟，建造了大量舒适、美好的工人住宅区。战后仅仅十年中，又建造了三亿平方公尺的居住面积。第六个五年计划期间，还要建造二亿零五百万平方公尺，即大约每年每千个城市居民中就有十四所新住宅。这在资本主义国家里是不能想像的。
    苏联之所以能这样大规模地快速建设，从技术上来说，主要是由于采用了设计标准化和建造的工业化。苏联是世界上唯一的已经在全国范围内推行标准设计的国家。1955年8月，苏共中央和部长会议决定，从1956年下半年起，除特殊的例外，一般民用建筑都要用标准设计，采用工厂预制构件。这个决定具体反映了苏联建筑工业化的先进水平和社会主义制度的优越性。
    苏联在建筑和城市规划的科学研究方面已取得了光辉的成就。苏联建筑与建设科学院是世界上最完善、最先进的建筑科学研究机构。此外，许多加盟共和国和大城市也有关于建筑与建设的科学研究机构。他们的工作都是密切联系实际的理论工作，出版大量专业图书和杂志，对于苏联的城市建设与建筑起着指导性作用。
    苏联的建筑高等学校每年大约为国家培养出四百五十名建筑师。他们都是受过全面训练、胜任工作的建筑师。两年半以来，苏联建筑教育注重标准设计和构件的工业化，并且学习最先进的施工方法。学生在工程技术方面的训练大大加强了。许多毕业不久的建筑师在大大小小的城市建设中正在起着重要的作用。
    苏联在城市建设和建筑事业中取得的辉煌成就给新中国的建筑工作者树立了榜样，并且鼓舞了我们。学习苏联的先进经验在中国建筑界早已形成了热潮。我们的许多城市和数以百计的工业企业建筑，在苏联专家的帮助下，在学习苏联的具体实践中，已经规划、设计、建造起来了。以马克思列宁主义为指导思想，以苏联的先进经验与中国实际情况相结合的社会主义城市已经在我们广阔的土地上逐步形成了。今天中国的新型城市也是“十月革命，一声炮响”给我们送来的。
    就以我们伟大的首都为例。1949年，苏联政府就派遣了以阿布拉西莫夫同志为首的专家组来帮助我们北京市的规划。以后几年中，先后有很多位专家前来帮助我们。1954年，又派遣了以勃德列夫同志为首的专家组来帮助我们。他们把苏联三十几年来社会主义城市建设的经验无保留地介绍给我们。在他们的无私帮助下，我们的建筑工作者——工人、建筑师、工程师和行政干部——发挥了巨大的积极性，我们首都的面貌已在改变，一个新型的社会主义的人民首都已在一步步地形成了。
    以勃德列夫同志为首的专家组，在1954年来到北京以后，立即对我们首都与城市规划有关的各方面的情况进行了全面的深入的调查、研究。对于北京的历史和现状，对于人口、土地、地貌、地质、水文、气候、各种建筑物、道路、广场、交通、运输、河湖、绿化、上下水、古迹、文物、工业、农业等等问题，都帮助我们搜集资料、分析、研究。北京市的总体规划以及道路系统、分区、街坊、水系、上下水、供热供电供燃气、交通、运输等等规划，在专家们的辛勤劳动下，已经完成了远景及近期的初步方案。几年以来，北京的规划已经具体地指导了八百多项的建设。
    除了帮助我们做规划外，专家们还帮助我们解决了许多具体问题。例如改建了北海大桥，改善了东西城的交通，保存了重要的文物建筑团城，同时也节约了一笔很大的投资。专家们除了帮助我们制定了交通运输规划外，还帮助我们大大地改善了首都的电车交通，还建议并帮助我们克服了重重困难开辟了环行线。
    专家们帮助我们拟定了水利规划。在调查研究工作中，他们连各种平房的厕所、粪坑、渗井都要亲自查看。教会了我们的干部学习农民用小量污水灌溉农田的方法，进行了对三路居农民污水灌溉的科学观测工作，使使用污水的田地由一百亩增加到今天的一千八百亩。除了拟制总的水利规划外，还指导我们做了永定河引水工程和前三门护城河的规划以及河水自来水厂、污水处理厂的初步设计和许多下水道干线的设计。
    在建筑设计和施工方面，专家们也给了我们很大的帮助。他们首先帮助我们加强了设计的计划工作，使按期出图有了保证。帮助我们建立了图纸检查制度。图纸的错误率显著地降低了，这就为施工方面提供了很大的便利。
    1954年，在专家们指导下，我们进行了三——四层住宅、中小学校、单身宿舍和办公楼的标准设计，并编制了预制构件图册和建筑标准构件和门窗大样图册，除了节约设计力量外，工厂加工和工地施工的效率也大大提高了。
    在结构设计方面，1953年，我们在专家们的指导下，开始建造多层砖石结构的建筑。目前我们已经用砖石钢筋混凝土混合结构做到十层。从1953年到现在，在四百万平方公尺的房屋建筑中，我们已节约了水泥五万吨，钢材六万吨以上，还节约了大量模板木材。我们还必须提到的是，建筑工程部的以斯米尔诺夫同志为首的专家组，城市建设部的以萨里舍夫同志为首的专家组，第二机械部的以斯特连拉同志为首的专家组，以及铁道部的西苗诺夫同志都给了我们极大的帮助，使我国的工业建设、城市建设和铁路建设更在全国范围内都取得了辉煌成就。还有以罗金同志为首的苏联大使馆的设计组，也直接和间接给了我们很大的帮助。
    在建筑教育方面，从1952年到1956年间，苏联政府先后派遣了阿谢普柯夫通讯院士，伊里切夫教授和阿凡钦柯教授到清华大学，帮助我们进行课程改革，制定教学计划和教学大纲；帮助我们建立并健全了教研组，建立了资料室和试验室；还帮助我们编写讲义，进行毕业设计和毕业答辩；明确了我们的教学方向和培养目标。今天，我们已经开始培养出了全面发展的建筑师，教学水平和学生的水平都在逐年提高。全国各高等学校建筑系的毕业生在祖国的城市建设和建筑事业中已经起了巨大的作用。
    当然，苏联专家们对于我们首都的规划和城市建设和建筑教育，以及全国许多城市和新兴工业城镇的规划、建设的帮助绝不止这些，但是就从上面所讲的，仅仅限于北京一个地区的一些事实看来，就可以知道，解放八年以来，我们在城市规划和建设方面取得的辉煌成就是和苏联人民、苏联政府、苏联专家的无私援助分不开的。
    解放八年以来，全国人民以实际行动响应党中央的号召，坚决学习苏联。在党的英明领导下，在苏联人民、苏联共产党、苏联政府以及在华苏联专家的具体帮助下，经过我们全国人民的不懈劳动，我们在经济、文化建设的各个领域中，包括我们的城市建设和建筑工作在内，已经取得辉煌的成就。但自从今年五月整风开始以来，特别在大鸣大放的初期，一小撮反动的右派分子们却睁着眼睛说瞎话，硬要说我们什么都是“漆黑一团”。他们仇恨我们的社会主义制度，污蔑我们的党，污蔑我们学习苏联是教条主义，企图以这些借口从根本上推翻我们的社会制度和国家体制，把我们拖回到资本主义的老路上去。半年以来，经过全国人民的坚决反击，用摆事实、讲道理的方法，右派分子们已被驳斥得哑口无言，大部分都已低头伏罪。
    今天，当我们在这里庆祝这个光辉的节日的时候，在苏联，在中国，在所有的社会主义国家里，社会主义的城市一个个在形成，数以亿计的劳动人民的居住条件正在一天比一天改善。与此同时，苏联的人造卫星正在高空飞翔，原子能发电站正在以廉价的电能供给苏联人民，图—114喷气式巨型客机正在缩短地球的直径，而在我国，庆祝武汉长江大桥落成通车和吉林三个化工厂开工生产的鞭炮锣鼓的余声还在我们的耳朵里。这只是苏联、中国无数成就中最近的几个。这一切，假使没有伟大的十月革命，没有伟大导师列宁的教导和指导，没有苏联共产党和中国共产党，没有我们优越的社会主义制度，没有无产阶级专政的人民民主国家，没有马克思列宁主义的指导思想，都是不可思议的。让我们和全国六亿人民，苏联人民和全世界善良正直的人民一起欢呼，庆祝这个伟大的社会主义革命四十周年的光辉节日吧！
