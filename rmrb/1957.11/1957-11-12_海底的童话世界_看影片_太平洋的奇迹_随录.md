The Fairytale World Under the Sea
——Notes After Watching the Film "Miracle in the Pacific"
Su Fang

When you read Andersen's "The Little Mermaid," have you ever felt sad for the fate of that kind and affectionate mermaid? When you read Pushkin's "The Tale of the Fisherman and the Fish," have you ever been awed by the magical power of the sea ruler who transformed into a golden fish? In the hands of immortal writers, the sea is so magical and mysterious, arousing our infinite reveries and fantasies! So, people who yearn for the sea, would you like to get a glimpse of the underwater world in the film "Miracle in the Pacific"? Of course, there are no real mermaid homes or sea god palaces there, but it is indeed a strange, diverse, and unpredictable fairytale realm!

Don't think that a drop of water drawn from the seabed is just a drop of water; it contains so many tiny lives! Under the microscope of Soviet scientists, the shapes of those microorganisms are magnified, allowing you to see them clearly with the naked eye. It turns out that there are so many different kinds of them. They are constantly wriggling, and they are also competing and bustling for their own survival.

Perhaps you will be surprised that such beautiful flowers actually bloom on the seabed. The orange-red ones are so delicate, and the jade-white ones are so pure and bright; however, you will soon find that these flowers are not static. When small fish or other small creatures swim near them, the stretched and slender petals will curl up and swallow those poor little animals. Only then will you suddenly realize that these are not flowers, but seabed animals stretching out their tentacles to capture food!

Of course, you will also be amazed by the dexterity of those hermit crabs, as they drill into the empty snail shells and find convenient, portable mobile homes for themselves. And wouldn't the pulsation of the sea scallop, which looks like a hard stone slab, also make you smile? This animal, which cannot crawl, knows how to use the opening and closing force of its gill flaps to move, replacing its invisible feet.

Humans have their own families, and marine animals also have their own families. The group of sea dogs densely gathered on the beach are not just a mob; they are gathered together, leading their respective families. As long as you observe carefully, you can see which is the father, which is the mother, and which are their children. And the sea dog mother has such deep maternal love! Returning from swimming, it rushes to its child's side to take care of it and caress it. ...

Endless novelties are presented before our eyes, a dazzling array, bizarre and motley, making us fascinated and amazed! This is indeed a miracle, a miracle of the Pacific!

The ocean of knowledge is boundless. When we sip a drop of water from it, we feel immense comfort and joy. We are watching "Miracle in the Pacific" with this happy mood—sipping this drop of water of knowledge—because it has increased our understanding of the ocean and revealed a corner of the mysterious underwater world.

    海底的童话世界
    ——看影片“太平洋的奇迹”随录
    苏方
    当你看安徒生的“海的女儿”时，你可曾为那善良的、钟情的人鱼的遭遇悲伤过？当你看普希金的“渔夫和金鱼的故事”时，你可曾被那幻化为金鱼的海的统治者的神力慑服住？在不朽的文人的笔底，海是那么神奇奥秘，海引起了我们无限的遐思和幻想！那么，神往于海的人们，你愿意在影片“太平洋的奇迹”中，一窥海底世界么？自然那儿没有真正的人鱼的住家或者海神的宫殿，然而那确是一个奇异多端、变幻莫测的童话境界啊！

    别以为从海底吸出的一滴水，仅仅是一滴水，其中却包含了多少细微的生命！在苏联科学家的显微镜下，那些微生物的形体扩大了，使你用肉眼也能看得清楚。原来他们的种类是那样繁多。它们不歇地蠕动着，而且也在为自己的生存角逐着，奔忙着哩。
    或许你会惊奇，海底居然也盛开着这么些美丽的花朵。那桔红色的多么娇艳，那玉白色的多么皎洁；但是，你不久便会发现，这些花朵并不是静止不动的。当小鱼或者什么旁的细小的生物游过他的近旁时，那舒展着的纤长的花瓣便会卷缩拢来，把那些可怜的小动物吞食进去。这时你才会恍然大悟，原来这不是什么花朵，而是海底动物伸展着他们的触须在捕捉食物！
    当然，你也会惊奇于那些寄居蟹的灵巧，它们钻进那空的螺壳里面，为自己找到了灵便的、可以随身携带的活动房屋。而那看来像硬石片的海扇的跃动，不也会逗起你的微笑么？这种不会爬行的动物，却知道利用自己的瓣鳃的开阖的力量来移动，以代替那无形的足。
    人类有自己的家庭，海兽也有自己的家庭。那一群密集在海滩上的海狗并不是乌合之众，它们是率领着各自的家族团聚在一起的。只要你仔细观察，便可以看出哪是父亲，哪是母亲，哪是它们的孩子们。而海狗妈妈又有着多么深厚的母爱啊！游泳归来，它便匆匆忙忙地赶到自己的孩子身边，照顾它，爱抚它。…………
    述说不尽的新奇事物展现在我们眼前，琳琅满目，光怪陆离，使我们迷离，使我们惊叹！这确是奇迹，太平洋的奇迹！
                      ※
    知识的海洋是无边无际的。当我们从中啜饮到一滴水时，我们便会感到莫大的欣慰和快乐。我们正是带着这种快乐的心情来观看“太平洋的奇迹”——啜饮这一滴知识之水的，因为它增进了我们对于海洋的理解，揭示了神秘的海底世界的一角。
