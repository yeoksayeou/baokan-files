Xinhua News Agency, 5th. The news of observing the second Soviet artificial satellite continues to come from all over the world.

The Skalnaté Pleso Observatory in Czechoslovakia clearly saw the second Soviet artificial satellite in the eastern sky on the morning of the 4th. Its brightness changed somewhat, similar to the stars of the Big Dipper. This is the first time Czechoslovakia has seen the second artificial satellite. This situation was immediately notified to the relevant Soviet authorities to help accurately calculate the satellite's orbit.

The Polish News Agency's radio station received the "beep, beep" signal from the second artificial satellite twice on the 3rd, lasting for two or three minutes. Its sound was much stronger than that of the first artificial satellite.

Romanian scientific workers received signals from the second artificial satellite on the afternoon of the 3rd and the morning of the 4th, and the reception was very good. The Romanian Central Radio Club contacts the Moscow Central Radio Club every day to exchange information on signal reception.

Many observers in Japan saw the second artificial satellite with telescopes and the naked eye on the morning of the 5th and received its signal. Observers at the Honjo Castle Observatory near Tokyo saw it as large as a soybean, passing to the right of Jupiter, and disappearing on the horizon in about twenty seconds. When the second artificial satellite passed over Japan for the second time, many observers saw it again with the naked eye. They all thought its brightness was much stronger than the first artificial satellite.

Observatories across the United States have also received signals from the second artificial satellite. U.S. aircraft pilot Owen and others discovered a star as bright as a fourth-magnitude star passing through the sky near Blythe on the night of the 4th while flying from Phoenix to San Francisco. They believe this is the first time the second Soviet artificial satellite has been seen in North America.

A farmer in Manila, Philippines, saw the second artificial satellite flying from east to west with the naked eye on the evening of the 3rd. It was larger than ordinary stars and emitted a yellow-red light.

Countries such as India, Italy, and Australia have successively received signals from the second Soviet artificial satellite. A radio station near Stockholm, the capital of Sweden, received seven signals in a row on the 4th.

    “新月”普照四方
    许多地方看到第二个卫星飞过
    新华社5日讯　世界各地继续传来观测到苏联第二颗人造卫星的消息。
    捷克斯洛伐克斯卡尔纳特山湖天文台在4日早晨在东边天空清楚地看到了苏联第二颗人造卫星。它的亮度先后有些变化，和大熊星座的星相差无几。这是捷克斯洛伐克第一次看到第二颗人造卫星。这个情况立刻通知了苏联有关机关，以便帮助精确地计算人造卫星的运行轨道。
    波兰通讯社的电台3日两次收到了第二颗人造卫星发出的讯号“噼，噼”的声音，达两、三分钟之久，它的声音比第一颗人造卫星发出的声音强得多。
    罗马尼亚的科学工作者在3日下午和4日清晨都收到了第二颗人造卫星发出的讯号，收听情况非常良好。罗马尼亚中央无线电俱乐部每天都和莫斯科中央无线电俱乐部取得联系，交换收听讯号情况。
    日本有很多观测者用望远镜和肉眼在5日晨看到了第二颗人造卫星并且收到了它的讯号。东京附近本所城的天文台观测人员看到它有一颗黄豆那样大，在木星的右边掠过，约二十秒钟即在天边隐没。当第二颗人造卫星第二次经过日本上空的时候，很多观测者又用肉眼看到了它。他们都认为它的亮度比第一颗人造卫星强得多。
    美国各地的天文台也都先后收到了第二颗人造卫星发出的讯号。美国飞机驾驶员欧恩等4日晚上从费匿克斯驾驶飞机飞往旧金山的时候，在布莱思附近发现一颗有四等星那样亮的星星掠过天空。他们认为这是北美洲第一次看到的苏联第二颗人造卫星。
    菲律宾马尼拉的一个农民在3日晚间用肉眼看到了第二颗人造卫星自东向西飞去。它比一般星星大，发出黄红色的光芒。
    印度、意大利、澳大利亚等国家都先后收到了苏联第二颗人造卫星发出的讯号。瑞典首都斯德哥尔摩附近的一座无线电台在4日一连收到了七次讯号。
