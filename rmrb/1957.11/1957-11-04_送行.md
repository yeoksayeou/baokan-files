    Seeing Off
    Fu Shi
Can you put six hundred million people on a train?
Let us go to Moscow together to participate in the parade!
I know the deep meaning of your smile,
Asking us to present our work achievements to welcome the Red Square broadcast.
The Red Square broadcast is sweeter year by year,
This year, the Chairman poured out thousands of words to the elder brother again.
These languages have fully represented our hearts,
No one needs to add or repeat it.
Forty years of victory have flowed like sweet springs,
Irrigating how many deserts turned into orchards,
The orchard's harvest is full of branches,
Happy people drink water and think of the source.
Please go and open your hearts to the fullest,
Release our surging enthusiasm,
In order to repay the kindness of the laboring motherland,
Let us throw ourselves into her embrace like a shower of bouquets.
Goodbye! Dear Chairman and delegation!
We will greet your return in the cheers of success,
The hands of peace and friendship will surely grasp everything,
War mongers can only spin in failure!

    送行
    俯拾你能把六亿人民带上火车？让我们一齐到莫斯科去参加游行！我知道你满含笑容的深意，叫我们拿出工作成绩去迎接红场的播音。红场的播音一年比一年甜，今年主席又向老大哥倾出万语千言。这些语言已代表尽我们的心意，用不着谁再来补充或重复一遍。四十年的胜利流来甘泉，灌溉了多少片荒漠变成果园，果园的丰收累累满枝，幸福的人民饮水思源。请你前去把心门尽情打开，放出我们的热情汹涌澎湃，为了报答劳动者祖国的恩情，让我们像花束的阵雨般投入她的胸怀。再见！亲爱的主席和代表团！我们将在成功的欢呼中迎接你回转，和平和友谊的手啊定能掌握住一切，战争贩子们只能在失败中转圈！
