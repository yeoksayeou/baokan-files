Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, October 31st. Thirty thousand people in Budapest held a mass rally on October 30th to mark the first anniversary of the counter-revolutionary rebellion. The rally was held at Republic Square, where the counter-revolutionary armed rebellion took place a year ago.

Members of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, Marosan György, Kish Karoly, and Kallai Gyula, attended the rally.

Before the start of the rally, the secretary of the Budapest Municipal Committee of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, Czickos Jozsefne, presided over the unveiling ceremony of the monument to the fallen martyrs. The names of those who were killed by counter-revolutionaries last year for defending the municipal party committee were inscribed on the monument. Those present observed a few minutes of silence to mourn the martyrs.

First Secretary of the Budapest Municipal Committee of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, Marosan György, then spoke. Marosan said that today we are gathered here not only to mourn the fallen martyrs, but also to draw strength and to commemorate the heroic struggle of the martyrs. When necessary, we will defend the people's regime with iron and blood. What happened here last year was a shameful event. The counter-revolutionaries cruelly massacred our best sons and daughters by various means. In this square, the counter-revolutionaries hung them under the trees, dug out their hearts and livers, and even insulted the corpses of the martyrs.

Marosan said that today we should deeply remember the lessons of this incident. We will never allow internal counter-revolutionaries and external enemies to collude and launch another counter-revolutionary rebellion. We must strengthen unity, consolidate discipline, and not make concessions in principle. Party members must be humble and set a good example in their work.

Marosan emphasized that it must be recognized that Hungary is not alone. It has such loyal friends as the people of the socialist camp, which strengthens the power of the masses united and defending the people's regime. The Soviet Union helped the socialist forces in Hungary crush the counter-revolution, and we will always be grateful for this assistance from the Soviet Union.

Marosan added that we can proudly say that we have relied on the political and economic support of our friends to uphold the dictatorship of the proletariat in our country. We will never allow Hungary to become an object of provocation for certain imperialists.

    沉痛纪念匈牙利事件一周年
    布达佩斯三十万群众集会
    马罗山号召人民记住教训加强团结
    新华社布达佩斯31日电　10月30日，布达佩斯市三十万人为反革命暴乱事件一周年举行了群众大会。集会的地点是在一年前反革命武装暴乱事件发生的共和国广场。
    匈牙利社会主义工人党中央委员会政治局委员马罗山·捷尔吉、基什·卡罗伊和卡拉伊·久洛等参加了大会。
    大会开始以前，匈牙利社会主义工人党布达佩斯市委书记奇克斯·约瑟夫妮主持死难烈士纪念碑的揭幕仪式。在这个纪念碑上刻有去年为保卫市委而被反革命分子杀害的人们的名字。到会者都静默数分钟向烈士致哀。
    匈牙利社会主义工人党布达佩斯市委第一书记马罗山。捷尔吉接着讲话。马罗山说，今天我们在这里集会不仅是为了向死难烈士致哀，而是为了吸取力量，为了纪念烈士们的英勇斗争。在必要的时候我们将以铁和血来保卫人民政权。去年在这里所发生的事件是一个可耻的事件。反革命分子用种种残酷手段把我们最优秀的儿女惨杀了。在这个广场上反革命分子把他们吊在树下挖去心肝，还侮辱烈士们的尸体。
    马罗山说，今天应该深刻地记住这个事件的教训。我们决不允许内部反革命分子和外部敌人勾结在一起再一次搞起反革命暴动。我们要加强团结，巩固纪律，不能够在原则上让步。党员要谦虚，要在工作中作出良好的榜样。
    马罗山强调说，要认识到匈牙利不是孤独的，它有着社会主义阵营各国人民这样的忠实朋友，这就增强了团结在一起并捍卫人民政权的群众的力量。苏联帮助匈牙利的社会主义力量粉碎了反革命，我们将永远感激苏联的这次援助。
    马罗山又说，我们可以自豪地说，我们依靠着朋友们在政治上和经济上的支持，坚持住了在我国的无产阶级专政。我们决不允许使匈牙利成为某些帝国主义挑拨的对象。
