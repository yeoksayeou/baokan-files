    Xinhua Bookstore Head Office's Airing of Views Gradually Deepening
    Implementing Mass Line and Vigorously Rectifying

    (Our Newspaper News) Xinhua Bookstore Head Office entered the third stage of rectification on October 22nd. By November 16th, the entire store had posted 658 big-character posters, raising 766 opinions. 132 people posted big-character posters, accounting for 97.8% of the total number of participants in the movement. As of November 23rd, 149 opinions have been processed and resolved. Currently, the rectification leadership group is vigorously implementing the mass line rectification policy, preparing to submit mass opinions in batches for mass discussion and handling.

    Judging from the big-character posters posted by the masses, opinions are relatively concentrated in business guidelines, systems, leadership style, and welfare aspects.

    In terms of business guidelines and systems, many people believe that the head office should drastically reduce its institutions and personnel. For example, some people believe that the division of labor between the Organization Technology Department and the Business Department is not clear, and there are business connections between them. Merging the two departments can not only solve the phenomenon of buck-passing in business, but also reduce staff by more than 42%.

    Big-character posters criticized the bureaucratic work style of the leadership. For example, some people pointed out that there were many problems in the Organization Technology Department, which had already affected the work, but the manager never went deep into the department to help solve them. The work of the "Book Publishing Report" editorial office is led by a manager, but the manager has not been to the editorial office once in more than a year.

    In the big-character posters, many comrades also exposed unreasonable phenomena in life and welfare, and put forward handling opinions. The head office's nursery still implements full-time care, with twenty-two staff members taking care of only forty-six children. Normally, the public subsidizes each child 26 yuan per month, and more than 30 yuan in winter. The head office currently implements housing and transportation subsidies. Some people receive housing subsidies from the head office every month, while their spouses also receive housing subsidies from other units; some people with many family members also receive family housing subsidies, and their housing subsidies have a surplus after paying the rent; even people who rent out houses receive public housing subsidies. The head office issues each employee a transportation subsidy of 2.5 yuan per month, and people who have bicycles receive it as well.

    The airing of views in the third stage of the Xinhua Bookstore Head Office's rectification was gradually carried out. When the struggle against the rightists basically ended and the rectification was promptly transferred to rectification, the staff and masses had concerns about the airing of views, especially those who had expressed one-sided and radical opinions in the early stages of the rectification, and could not fully distinguish between malicious attacks and well-intentioned criticisms, so they were afraid of making mistakes and being turned against themselves.

    At the mobilization meeting, the comrades of the rectification team leadership made repeated explanations, so that the staff and masses could distinguish the difference between the rightists' attack and the well-intentioned criticism. After the airing of views began, the leadership earnestly implemented the spirit of "drawing fire to oneself," reported the airing of views to the staff and masses three times, commended activists, dispelled concerns, put forward requirements, and convened meetings of group leaders to exchange experiences, and constantly mobilized each group to hold discussions, deliberate, and promote the gradual deepening of the airing of views.

### 新华书店总店鸣放逐步深入  正在贯彻群众路线大力进行整改

    新华书店总店鸣放逐步深入
    正在贯彻群众路线大力进行整改
    本报讯　新华书店总店从10月22日转入整风第三阶段。到11月16日，全店共贴出大字报六百五十八张，提出意见七百六十六条。贴大字报的有一百三十二人，占参加运动总人数的97．8％。到11月23日止，已经处理解决的意见有一百四十九条。目前，整风领导小组正大力贯彻群众路线的整改方针，准备把群众意见分批交由群众讨论处理。
    从群众贴出的大字报来看，意见比较集中在业务方针、体制、领导作风以及生活福利等方面。
    在业务方针、体制方面，许多人认为总店应当狠狠地紧缩机构、减少人员。比如有些人认为组织技术处和业务处分工不明确，业务上互有牵连。两个处合并不仅可以解决业务上踢皮球的现象，并且可以减少工作人员42％以上。
    大字报批评了领导方面的官僚主义作风。如有人提出组织技术处里问题很多，并已影响工作，但经理从来没有深入到处里帮助解决。“图书发行报”编刊室的工作由一位经理负责领导，但那位经理一年多也没有到编刊室去过一次。
    在大字报上，许多同志还揭发了生活福利方面不合理的现象，并且提出了处理意见。总店的托儿所现在仍实行全托，二十二个工作人员只看四十六个孩子。平常，公家每月还要对每个孩子补贴二十六元，冬季则补贴三十元以上。总店目前还实行房贴、车贴制度，有的人每月在总店拿房贴，他的爱人在别的单位也拿房贴；有些家属多的人还领取家属房贴，他们所领的房贴除付房租外还有剩余；甚至出租房子的人也拿公家的房贴。总店每月发给每个职工二元五角的车贴，有自行车的人也照样领取。
    新华书店总店整风第三阶段的大鸣大放是逐步开展起来的。当反右派斗争基本结束及时转入整改时，职工群众对大鸣大放是有顾虑的，特别是在整风初期鸣放中发表过片面偏激意见的人，对于恶意的攻击与善意的批评不能完全分辨清楚，因而怕放错了反到自己的头上。
    在动员大会上，整风小组领导的同志作了反复说明，使职工群众分清了右派进攻和善意批评的区别。鸣放开始以后，领导上又认真贯彻了“引火烧身”的精神，曾经三次向职工群众报告鸣放情况，表扬积极分子，解除顾虑，提出要求，并且召开了各小组长会议，交流经验，不断发动各小组座谈，酝酿，推动鸣放逐步深入。
