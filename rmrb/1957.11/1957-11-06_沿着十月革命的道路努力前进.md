Strive Forward Along the Road of the October Revolution

    At this moment of celebrating the fortieth anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution, the hearts of the Chinese people and hundreds of millions of people in the world are turned towards the Soviet people, thanking them for opening up the brilliant road of socialism for the world proletariat and for setting a great example for all mankind in building socialism and communism.
    The October Revolution shook the whole world at that time. The longer the time passes, the more obvious its role in the history of mankind becomes. The development of actual life over the past forty years has proved that the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet people, who achieved the victory of the October Revolution forty years ago and have continuously developed and strengthened the socialist country born from the October Revolution over the past forty years, have made inestimable contributions to the cause of human progress in our time.
    The victory of the October Revolution and the existence and development of the Soviet Union fundamentally shook the rule of imperialism throughout the world. The October Revolution led one-sixth of the world's land onto the path of socialism, marking the beginning of the collapse of the imperialist enslavement and rule over the world. The imperialists dreamed of reversing this historical process of development. As early as the initial period of the Soviet Union's establishment, they attempted to "strangle this socialist country in its cradle." Fourteen capitalist countries, including all the major imperialist powers, launched armed intervention. During World War II, Nazi Germany, with the military and industrial power of almost the entire Europe, launched a fierce attack on the Soviet Union. None of these severe tests overwhelmed the Soviet Union; on the contrary, the powerful enemy was overwhelmed and defeated. In every contest, the Soviet Union emerged victorious. The facts shattered the myth of the so-called invincibility of imperialism. The oppressed people all over the world under the rule of imperialism gained infinite hope and confidence from this.
    The Soviet Union has already achieved extremely brilliant achievements in socialist construction. Through the socialist transformation of the entire national economy and the planned development of the socialist economy and culture, the Soviet Union built a socialist society as early as the mid-1930s. Now, Soviet society is gradually transitioning to communism. For the first time in human history, a new society with high productivity and the complete elimination of exploitation of man by man has emerged; a dream passed down through generations of working people, the dream that everyone can live a happy life through honest labor, has begun to become a reality. Facts have proved that only the socialist system can eliminate the anarchy, crises, and unemployment in economic life that are inevitable in capitalist society, and enable social productive forces to develop forward without limit. Relying on the superiority of the socialist system, the Soviet Union has now become a great industrial power, and the Soviet people have become the masters and creators of the world's highest level of science and technology and the most outstanding culture and art. The highest form of democracy in human history has been realized in the national and social life of the Soviet Union. The various ethnic groups in the Soviet Union have rapidly developed into advanced socialist nations, and have united with each other to become an equal and fraternal family of nations. The Soviet people have used unremitting efforts to prove to the world the absolute superiority of the socialist system over the capitalist system, making socialism truly attract the hearts of progressive people all over the world. The future of mankind can only be pinned on socialism, which has become a universally recognized truth by progressive people all over the world.
    The Soviet people have given significant support and assistance to the revolutionary workers' movements and the national liberation movements in colonial and semi-colonial countries around the world. The fact that the Soviet Union has developed through all kinds of storms and waves over the past forty years has played a role in promoting and inspiring the liberation struggles of all oppressed peoples. In international affairs, the Soviet Union has consistently pursued a foreign policy of maintaining peace, recognizing the equality of all nations, and opposing imperialist aggression. During World War II, the fact that all mankind was spared from the dark rule of fascism must be mainly attributed to the Soviet Union. The Soviet army, in cooperation with the people of relevant countries, liberated the Eastern European countries and part of Central Europe, and liberated the northeastern region of China and the northern part of Korea. The Soviet Union and the various socialist countries newly emerged after World War II have formed a close alliance and formed a powerful socialist camp, and have provided extremely important assistance to these countries, which is of extremely great significance for consolidating the security and independence of these countries and rapidly laying the economic foundation of socialism. The Soviet Union has also given significant support to the surging movement of oppressed nations around the world striving for liberation, to the movement of people around the world striving for peace, and to the many newly emerging peaceful countries in Asia and Africa. The Soviet Union, born from the October Revolution, is now an important pillar of the entire destiny of human history and the central force of the progressive cause and international peace cause in the world.
    When mentioning the contributions of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet people to the world, one must also particularly mention the extremely rich experiences they have created in engaging in socialist revolution and socialist construction. Due to the historical conditions at that time, the founders of Marxism, Marx and Engels, could only put forward principled instructions on the issues of socialist revolution and socialist construction, and some of their important ideas were obliterated and distorted by the opportunists of the Second International. Lenin criticized various forms of opportunists and restored Marx's doctrine of proletarian revolution and proletarian dictatorship, and developed this doctrine forward based on the practical experience of the international workers' movement under the new historical conditions. The victory of the October Revolution and Soviet construction is the victory of Marxism-Leninism. Communist parties and revolutionary working classes all over the world can and must learn the revolutionary theory of Marxism-Leninism through the experience of the October Revolution and Soviet construction, because the basic content of these experiences reflects the common laws of transition to socialism in various countries, and to this day, the Soviet experience is still the most complete experience on the issues of proletarian revolution and socialist construction. This complete set of experience is the most valuable wealth in the international communist movement.
    The Chinese Communists and the Chinese people have a very deep understanding of the great world significance of the October Revolution. We learned Marxism-Leninism from the October Revolution, and we learned from the Bolshevik Party that led the October Revolution how to establish a Marxist-Leninist working-class party in China that could lead the Chinese revolution. In those dark days when the Chinese people were under the severe oppression of imperialism and feudalism, the beacon of the October Revolution always shone on us, increasing our infinite confidence, courage, and strength in the struggle. The brotherly sympathy and support of the Soviet people was an important factor in the victory of our revolution. After the victory of the Chinese revolution, we received full support from the Soviet Union in the struggle to consolidate the security of our country, and even more so, we received comprehensive and huge assistance from the Soviet Union in our socialist construction. Because we have the rich experience of the Soviet Union over the past forty years for our reference and learning, we can take fewer detours in our progress and find the correct path more quickly. Therefore, Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Our Chinese people have precisely achieved today's victory and achievements along the road of the Great October Socialist Revolution. Chinese people have consistently regarded the Chinese revolution as a continuation of the Great October Socialist Revolution and are extremely honored by this."
    Lenin taught that in order to defeat opportunism and "Left" dogmatism within the workers' movement, in order to overthrow the bourgeoisie and solve the unified international tasks of the proletariat, one must be good at examining, studying, exploring, guessing, and grasping the characteristics and particularities of each nation, so as to "correctly apply the basic principles of communism (Soviet power, proletarian dictatorship), so that these principles can have correct formal changes in local aspects, so that these principles can correctly adapt to the special circumstances of nations and nation-states." (See "'Left-Wing' Communism: An Infantile Disorder") In the long-term revolutionary practice, the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people have learned to combine the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism, the basic experience of the Soviet revolution and construction with the specific practice of the Chinese revolution, and thus achieved today's victory and achievements. Because the Chinese revolution and construction were carried out in a large Eastern country with a backward economy, because they were carried out under the new international conditions after World War II, some new experiences have been created in the policy towards the domestic bourgeoisie, in the realization of agricultural cooperativization, and in the specific forms of organizing national and social life. However, these experiences were created precisely on the basis of the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism and the basic experience of the Soviet revolution and construction. Any form of revisionist tendency that deviates from the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism and belittles the basic experience of the Soviet Union since the October Revolution is, in our opinion, unacceptable.
    On the basis of the victory of the Russian October Revolution in 1917 and the victory of the Chinese Revolution in 1949, the more than 800 million people of China and the Soviet Union have formed an unprecedentedly strong and solid unity and friendship in the history of the world. As Comrade Mao Zedong said: "This unity and friendship is not only a favorable factor in the socialist construction and communist construction of our two countries, but also an important part of the unity of socialist countries and a reliable guarantee for the cause of world peace and human progress."
    The common goal of building a communist society and realizing lasting world peace, the common theoretical foundation of Marxism-Leninism, the struggle against the common enemy of imperialism, the supreme interests of one's own country and the common great ideals of the liberation of all mankind closely unite the people of China and the Soviet Union, and closely unite the people of all socialist countries. This unity is eternal and unbreakable.
    The cause of creating socialist and communist societies is a novel cause in the history of the world. As Lenin said: In this novel cause, how can there be no failures and mistakes? But the most important thing is that this cause has been successfully created and is developing forward day by day. The failures and mistakes in our work can be overcome by relying on the democratic supervision of millions of people, relying on our self-criticism, and relying on the inexhaustible vitality emerging from the socialist system. However, the various diseases of the fully decayed capitalist system, based on the antagonistic contradiction between socialized production and the private ownership of the means of production, are incurable. The bourgeois reactionaries cannot have and dare not have self-criticism, but only attempt to find their own way out by slaughtering mankind. But historical experience has proved that launching a world war cannot save the fate of capitalism, but will only accelerate its demise.
    Completely opposite to the bourgeois reactionaries, we, the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union, we, the October believers all over the world—the communists of various countries, are resolutely opposed to imperialist aggression and advocate maintaining international peace. We want neither hot war nor cold war. We demand an immediate cessation of testing and a permanent ban on the use of nuclear weapons, demand a cessation of the arms race, demand the replacement of opposing military blocs with collective security treaties, and demand the implementation of peaceful coexistence and peaceful competition between countries with different social systems. We resolutely condemn the United States' despicable and shameless aggression and subversive activities against the independent state of Syria, and resolutely support the struggle of Syria and the people of Arab countries against colonialism. The banner of human justice, peace, and friendship among peoples of all countries raised by the October Revolution forty years ago is a just banner. Now the countries that support peace (including the socialist countries and the newly independent nationalist countries) already include more than 1.5 billion people, accounting for the majority of all mankind; and the vast majority of people in the Western capitalist countries also support peace. Therefore, we believe that the struggle to maintain peace can be victorious. The imperialists who dare to launch a new world war are bound to perish.
    The cause started by the October Revolution is invincible, because it is the personal cause of hundreds of millions of people striving for happiness and freedom, and it is the cause that reflects the inevitable laws of human historical development. This cause has achieved historical and great victories and fundamentally changed the world situation. The Chinese people, together with the great Soviet people, together with the people of all fraternal socialist countries, and together with the progressive people of all countries in the world, are advancing confidently along the road of the October Revolution, striving for new and greater victories in the cause of human progress and world peace.

    沿着十月革命的道路努力前进
　　董必武
    当这庆祝伟大的十月社会主义革命四十周年的时刻，中国人民和世界各国亿万人民的心都向着苏联人民，感谢他们为世界无产阶级开辟了社会主义的光辉道路，为全人类作出了建设社会主义和共产主义的伟大榜样。
    十月革命在当时就震动了全世界。时间隔得越久，它在世界人类历史上所起的作用也越加明显了。四十年来的实际生活的发展证明，在四十年前取得了十月革命的胜利，四十年来又使十月革命中产生的社会主义国家不断地发展壮大起来的苏联共产党和苏联人民，对于当代人类进步事业的贡献是不可估量的。
    十月革命的胜利以及苏联的存在和发展从根本上动摇了帝国主义在全世界的统治。十月革命使世界上六分之一的土地走上了社会主义的道路，标志着帝国主义对全世界的奴役统治的开始崩溃。帝国主义者梦想扭转这个历史的发展进程，早在苏联成立的初期，他们就企图把这个社会主义国家“扼杀在摇篮中”，包括所有帝国主义强国在内的十四个资本主义国家发动了武装干涉；第二次世界大战中，纳粹德国挟持着几乎整个欧洲的军事和工业的力量向苏联进行了凶猛的进攻。这些严酷的考验都没有压倒苏联，反而是强大的敌人被压倒了，失败了。在每一次较量中，苏联都取得了胜利。事实粉碎了所谓帝国主义不可战胜的神话。全世界在帝国主义统治下的被压迫的人民，由此而得到了无限的希望和信心。
    苏联的社会主义建设已经取得了极其辉煌的成就。通过对全部国民经济实行社会主义改造和有计划地发展社会主义的经济和文化，苏联早在三十年代中叶就建成了社会主义社会，现在苏联社会正在逐步地向共产主义过渡。人类历史上破天荒第一次出现了具有高度生产力而彻底消灭了人剥削人的现象的新的社会；劳动人民世代相传的一种梦想，一切人都可以靠诚实的劳动而过幸福生活的梦想从此开始成为现实。事实证明，只有社会主义制度才能消除在资本主义社会中不可避免的经济生活的无政府状态、危机和失业，而使社会生产力无限制地向前发展。依靠社会主义制度的优越性，苏联现在已经成为伟大的工业强国，苏联人民已经成为世界上最高度的科学技术和最优秀的文化艺术的掌握者和创造者。在苏联的国家生活和社会生活中实现了人类历史上最高形式的民主制。苏联国内各民族已经迅速地发展成为社会主义的先进民族，并且互相团结起来成为了平等友爱的民族大家庭。苏联人民用坚持不懈的努力向全世界证明了社会主义制度对于资本主义制度的绝对优越性，使得社会主义真正吸引了全世界进步人类的心。人类的前途只能寄托在社会主义上面，这已经是全世界进步人类公认的真理了。
    苏联人民对于世界各国的革命的工人运动，和殖民地半殖民地的民族解放运动，给了重大的支持和援助。苏联在四十年来经过各种惊涛骇浪而向前发展，这个事实本身对于一切被压迫人民的解放斗争就起了推动和鼓舞的作用。苏联在国际事务上一贯地执行了维护和平，承认各民族平等和反对帝国主义侵略的外交政策。在第二次世界大战中，全人类能够免于受法西斯的黑暗统治，不能不主要归功于苏联。苏联军队同有关各国人民合作解放了东欧各国和中欧的一部分，解放了中国的东北地区和朝鲜的北部。苏联和第二次大战后新产生的各社会主义国家，结成了亲密的联盟关系，组成了强大的社会主义阵营，并且向这些国家提供了极其重要的援助，这对于巩固这些国家的安全和独立，迅速地奠定社会主义的经济基础，有极其重大的意义。对于正在汹涌高涨的全世界被压迫民族争取解放的运动，对于全世界人民争取和平的运动，对于亚非地区新产生的许多和平国家，苏联也给了重大的支持。从十月革命中诞生的苏联现在已经是整个人类历史命运的重要支柱，是全世界进步事业和国际和平事业的中心力量。
    在说到苏联共产党和苏联人民对于世界人类的贡献的时候，还不能不特别提到他们在从事社会主义革命和社会主义建设中所创造的极其丰富的经验。马克思主义的创始人，马克思和恩格斯，由于当时的历史条件，只能对于社会主义革命问题和社会主义建设问题提出原则的指示，而他们的有些重要的思想又曾受到了第二国际机会主义者的抹煞和歪曲。列宁批驳了形形色色的机会主义者而恢复了马克思主义的无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政的学说，并且根据国际工人运动在新的历史条件下的实践经验而向前发展了这个学说。十月革命和苏联建设的胜利就是马克思列宁主义的胜利。全世界各国共产党人和革命的工人阶级都可以，而且必须通过十月革命和苏联建设的经验来学习马克思列宁主义的革命学说，因为这些经验中的基本内容是反映了世界各国过渡到社会主义的共同规律性的，而且至今苏联的经验仍然是在无产阶级革命和社会主义建设问题上的最完全的经验。这一套完全的经验是国际共产主义运动中的最可宝贵的财富。
    对于十月革命的伟大世界意义，中国共产党人和中国人民是有很深切的体会的。我们从十月革命学到了马克思列宁主义，我们从领导十月革命的布尔什维克党学到了如何在中国建立一个能够领导中国革命的马克思列宁主义的工人阶级政党。在中国人民处于帝国主义、封建主义的严重压迫下的那些黑暗日子里，十月革命的灯塔始终照耀着我们，使我们在斗争中增加了无穷的信心、勇气和力量。苏联人民的兄弟般的同情和支持是我们的革命能够取得胜利的一个重要因素。中国革命胜利以后，我们在为巩固自己国家的安全的斗争中得到了苏联的充分的支持，在我们的社会主义建设中更是得到了苏联的全面的巨大的援助。由于有了苏联四十年来的丰富的经验可供我们借鉴和学习，我们在前进中间能够少走许多弯路，能够比较迅速地找到正确的途径。所以毛泽东同志说：“我们中国人民正是沿着十月社会主义革命的道路取得今天的胜利和成就的。中国人民一贯把中国革命看作是伟大的十月社会主义革命的继续，并且以此为莫大的光荣。”
    列宁教导说：为着战胜工人运动内部的机会主义和“左倾”教条主义，为着推翻资产阶级和解决统一的无产阶级的国际任务，就应当善于考察、研究、探索、猜度和把握每个民族的特点和特性，以便“正确运用共产主义的基本原则（苏维埃政权，无产阶级专政），使这些原则在局部方面能有正确的形式上的变动，使这些原则能正确适应民族和民族国家的特殊情形。”（见“共产主义运动中的‘左派’幼稚病”）中国共产党和中国人民在长期的革命实践中，学会了把马克思列宁主义的普遍真理、把苏联革命和建设的基本经验同中国革命的具体实践结合起来，因而取得了今天的胜利和成就。中国革命和建设，因为是在一个经济落后的东方大国内进行的，因为是在第二次世界大战后的新的国际条件下进行的，在对待国内资产阶级的政策上、在实现农业合作化以及在组织国家和社会生活的具体形式上，创造出了一些新的经验。但是，这些经验都正是在马克思列宁主义的基本原则和苏联革命和建设的基本经验的基础上创造出来的。背离马克思列宁主义的基本原则和贬低从十月革命以来的苏联的基本经验的任何形式的修正主义倾向，我们认为，都是不能容许的。
    在1917年俄国十月革命胜利和1949年中国革命胜利的基础上，中苏两国八亿以上的人民，结成了世界历史上空前强大和巩固的团结和友谊。正如毛泽东同志所说：“这种团结和友谊，不仅是我们两国社会主义建设和共产主义建设事业中的有利因素，而且是社会主义各国团结的重要部分，也是世界和平人类进步事业的可靠保证。”
    建设共产主义和实现世界持久和平的共同目标，马克思列宁主义的共同理论基础，对共同敌人帝国主义的斗争，自己国家的最高利益和全人类解放的共同的伟大理想，使中苏两国人民紧密地团结在一起，使社会主义各国的人民紧密地团结在一起。这种团结是永恒的，牢不可破的。
    创立社会主义和共产主义社会的事业，是全世界历史上的新奇事业。正如列宁所说：在这个新奇事业中，怎么能没有一些失利和错误呢？但最重要的，是这个事业已经创立成功了，而且正在一天天向前发展。我们工作中的失利和错误，依靠千百万人民群众的民主的监督，依靠我们的自我批评，依靠从社会主义制度中涌现出来的源源不尽的有生力量，都是可以克服的。但是，已经充分腐朽了的资本主义体系的建立在社会性的生产和生产资料的私人占有之间的对抗性矛盾基础上的各种病症，却是不能医治的。资产阶级反动派不能有也不敢有自我批评，而只是企图用屠杀人类的方法来寻找自己的出路。但是历史的经验已经证明，发动世界大战也挽救不了资本主义的命运，反而只会加速它的灭亡。
    和资产阶级反动派完全相反，我们以苏联为首的社会主义各国，我们全世界的十月信徒——各国的共产党人，是坚决地反对帝国主义侵略，主张维护国际和平的。我们不仅不要热战，也不要冷战。我们要求立即停止试验和永远禁止使用核武器，要求停止军备竞赛，要求用集体安全条约来代替对立性的军事集团，要求社会制度不同的国家实行和平共处和进行和平竞赛。我们坚决谴责美国对独立的叙利亚国家所进行的卑鄙无耻的侵略和颠覆活动，坚决支持叙利亚和阿拉伯各国人民反对殖民主义的斗争。四十年前十月革命所举起的人类正义、和平和各国人民友好的旗帜，是正义的旗帜。现在拥护和平的国家（包括各社会主义国家和新近取得独立的民族主义国家）已经包含有十五亿以上的人口，即占了全人类的大多数；拥护和平的，还有西方各资本主义国家的广大人民。因此，我们相信，维护和平的斗争是能够胜利的。胆敢发动新的世界战争的帝国主义者则必遭灭亡。
    十月革命所开始的事业是不可战胜的，因为它是亿万人民群众争取幸福和自由的切身事业，是反映了人类历史发展的必然规律性的事业。这个事业已经获得了历史性的伟大胜利，根本转移了世界局面。中国人民和伟大的苏联人民在一起，和各兄弟社会主义国家的人民在一起，和世界各国的进步人类在一起，满怀信心地沿着十月革命的道路前进，努力争取人类进步和世界和平事业的新的更大的胜利。
