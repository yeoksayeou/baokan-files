Xinhua News Agency Report: Paris Dispatch: The North Atlantic Group Parliamentary Meeting closed on the morning of the 16th. In the absence of the French delegation, the meeting passed a resolution calling on the disunited member states of the North Atlantic Group to strengthen "unity."

The resolution requested that governments consult with each other before taking "any decisions that might undermine Atlantic unity." The resolution stated: Recent events have shown "the extent to which disunity on the political front can affect the unity of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization."

On the afternoon of the 15th, the meeting also passed two resolutions promoting the atomic arms race: requesting the establishment of a North Atlantic Group "missile training center" and requesting the strengthening of the group's so-called "defense system."

These resolutions will be submitted to the group's council for consideration at the Paris meeting in December.

After the French delegation withdrew from the meeting on the morning of the 15th due to dissatisfaction with the United States and Britain's shipment of arms to Tunisia, the standing committee and political committee of the parliamentary meeting held meetings to discuss mediating the dispute. However, the French delegation continued to announce a boycott of the meeting. According to Agence France-Presse, some Western parliamentarians participating in the meeting felt uneasy about the open discord between the three major member states: the United States, Britain, and France.

The North Atlantic Group Parliamentary Meeting officially opened on November 12th and was originally scheduled to last for a week. The first stage of the meeting studied military issues. The second stage of the meeting was originally scheduled to discuss political and economic issues. However, just as the discussion entered this stage, the French delegation angrily withdrew from the meeting due to the US and British decision to ship weapons to Tunisia, causing the extravagant talk of "strengthening unity" and "mutual dependence" promoted by the meeting to end in quarrels.

The North Atlantic Group's Permanent Representatives Council then held a special meeting on the same afternoon to discuss the serious dispute between France and Britain and the United States caused by the Anglo-American arms shipment to Tunisia. However, according to the Associated Press, this secret meeting "did not bridge the rift between France and Britain and the United States." The council decided to hold another meeting next week.

According to well-informed sources, the group's Secretary-General Spaak emphasized at the meeting that member states "urgently need" to conduct political consultations before any member state of the North Atlantic Group takes any decisive action that could affect other member states.

France, which withdrew from the North Atlantic Group Parliamentary Meeting the previous day due to the British and American arms shipment to Tunisia, sent its permanent representative to the council, Étienne de Crouy-Chanel, to attend the council meeting. French delegation officials said at the end of the meeting that they were "dissatisfied" with the meeting.

On the same day, French Defense Minister Chaban-Delmas, who was inspecting the Algerian-Tunisian border, told reporters, sharply criticizing the United States and Britain, saying, "The attitude of the United States and British governments is contrary to Western unity. This attitude is a real danger to the Atlantic Alliance."

General Billotte, an advisor to the French delegation participating in the North Atlantic Group Parliamentary Meeting, issued a statement in Paris on the same day, advocating that a meeting of the foreign ministers of Britain, France, and the United States be held immediately to resolve their differences, and believed that this was the key to the success of the highest-level meeting of the council in December.

According to London diplomatic sources, Britain and the United States are engaging in behind-the-scenes activities to repair this rift, which "threatens to shake the North Atlantic Treaty Organization alliance," and hope that Spaak will "mediate."

    “互相依赖”变成互相争吵
    北大西洋集团议员会议不欢而散
    理事会也没有弥合法英美在突尼斯问题上的裂痕
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：巴黎消息：北大西洋集团议员会议16日上午闭幕。会议在法国代表团缺席的情况下通过一项决议，呼吁不团结的北大西洋集团成员国要加强“团结”。
    这项决议要求各国政府在采取“任何可能有损大西洋团结的决定”以前要彼此商量。决议说：最近的事件表明了，“政治阵线上的不团结可以影响北大西洋公约组织的团结到什么程度。”
    会议还在15日下午通过了两项鼓吹原子军备竞赛的决议：要求建立北大西洋集团“导弹训练中心”和要求加强这个集团的所谓“防御体系”。
    这些决议都将提交这个集团的理事会，以便在12月巴黎会议时予以考虑。
    在15日上午法国代表团因为不满美国和英国运送军火给突尼斯而退出会议以后，议员会议的常设委员会和政治委员会都开了会讨论调解这次争吵的问题，但是，法国代表团一直宣布抵制这个会议。据法新社报道，参加会议的一些西方国家的议员对于这次美、英、法三个主要成员国间公开的不和感到不安。
    北大西洋集团议员会议是11月12日正式开幕的，原定举行一星期。会议的第一阶段研究了军事问题。会议的第二阶段原定讨论政治和经济问题，在讨论刚刚进入这一阶段后，由于美、英决定运送武器给突尼斯，法国代表团在一怒之下退出了会议，使这次会议鼓吹的“加强团结”和“互相依赖”的奢谈就此以争吵而告终。
    北大西洋集团常任代表理事会接着在同一天下午举行了一次特别会议来讨论由于英美向突尼斯运送武器而造成的法国同英美之间的严重纠纷。但是据美联社报道，这次秘密会议“并没有弥合法国同英、美两国之间的裂痕”。理事会决定下星期还要开会。
    据消息灵通人士说，这个集团的秘书长斯巴克在会上强调指出，在任何一个北大西洋集团的成员国采取任何能够影响其他成员国的决定性行动以前，成员国之间“迫切需要”进行政治协商。
    在前一天因为英、美运送军火给突尼斯而退出了北大西洋集团议员会议的法国，派遣它在理事会的常驻代表艾蒂安纳·德克鲁伊·尚内出席了理事会会议。法国代表团人士在会议结束时说，他们“不满意”这次会议。
    同一天，正在阿尔及利亚—突尼斯边境视察的法国国防部长沙邦—戴尔马对记者发表谈话，尖锐地指责美英两国说，“美国和英国政府的态度是和西方团结相违背的。这种态度对大西洋联盟来说是一个真正的危险。”
    参加北大西洋集团议员会议的法国代表团顾问毕约特将军同一天在巴黎发表声明，主张立即举行英、法、美外长会议来解决它们之间的分歧，并且认为这是12月份的理事会最高级会议能否成功的关键。
    据伦敦外交人士说，英国和美国正在进行幕后活动来弥补这个“有动摇北大西洋公约组织联盟的危险”的裂痕，并且希望斯巴克加以“斡旋”。
