Workers and Peasants Enthusiastically Study Culture
Liaoning Eliminates Illiteracy for Over One Million People

(Our newspaper report) The work of eliminating illiteracy in Liaoning Province has been extremely effective. In the eight years or so from 1949 to the present, illiteracy has been eliminated for 1.1 million peasant farmers; in the five years or so from 1952 to the present, 400,000 workers and cadres have shed the label of illiterate.

Before liberation, 80% of farmers in the province aged fourteen to forty-five were illiterate; now this has been reduced to 50%; among the farmers who have shed the label of illiterate, nearly 100,000 are studying in higher primary school classes. Nine townships and fifty agricultural producers' cooperatives in the province have completely eliminated illiteracy. In Xiaoshan Township, Changtu County, twelve farmers, after shedding their illiterate status, have become agricultural technicians. The six cooperative directors and twenty-two production team leaders in this township, after becoming literate, are able to use production target numbers to manage the cooperative's production, strengthening the planning of work.

Among the workers and cadres who have already shed the label of illiterate, 280,000 have graduated from higher primary, junior middle, and senior middle school classes, respectively. In the province, there is not a single illiterate cadre at the district level or above.

The Party and the government have always been concerned about the work of eliminating illiteracy. Illiteracy elimination committees have been established in all cities and counties to lead this work. There are more than 1,000 full-time cadres in the province leading farmers' spare-time education, and the literacy campaign army that has been formed has more than 100,000 people, of whom more than 11,400 have been awarded the title of activist in eliminating illiteracy. In the cities, almost all factories, mines, institutions, and streets have established regular spare-time cultural schools, and many factories and mines have transferred middle-level leading cadres to serve as leaders of the spare-time cultural schools. Party organizations and administrative departments, trade unions at all levels, ensure that workers' spare-time cultural study time is not encroached upon, and actively solve specific problems such as funding, school buildings, and teaching equipment, creating material conditions for workers' spare-time cultural study.

Under the care of the Party and the government, the enthusiasm of the liberated workers and peasants for learning culture is very high. Farmers in various places have adapted to the rural production situation, adopting the principle of "no learning when busy, less learning when slightly busy, more learning when not busy," and persisting in their studies. This spring, when the whole province was fighting drought, 370,000 farmers still insisted on studying. After cooperativization, the number of farmers participating in learning more than doubled compared to before cooperativization. From the high tide of cooperativization in the winter of 1955 to the present, the province has eliminated illiteracy for a total of 800,000 farmers, while in the previous six years, a total of 300,000 illiterate farmers were removed. In the cities, there are currently more than 633,000 factory and mine workers and more than 147,000 party and government mass organization cadres participating in cultural study in the province. A total of 225,000 people in Shenyang City are participating in learning, an increase of nine times compared to 1949.

According to existing materials, it is estimated that another 100,000 illiterate farmers can be eliminated by the end of this year, increasing the number of farmers who have shed the label of illiterate to 1.2 million, exceeding the first Five-Year Plan by 20%.

    工人、农民热情学习文化
    辽宁扫除文盲百余万人
    本报讯　辽宁省扫除文盲的工作成效极为显著。在从1949年到现在的八年多的时间内，扫除了一百一十万农民文盲；在从1952年到现在五年多的时间内，有四十万职工和干部摘掉了文盲的帽子。
    建国前，全省十四岁到四十五岁的农民中，有80％是文盲，现在已经减少到50％；在摘掉文盲帽子的农民中，有将近十万人正在高小班学习。全省有九个乡、五十个农业生产合作社完全扫除了文盲。昌图县小山乡十二名农民，脱离了文盲状态之后，已经当上农业技术员。这个乡的六个合作社主任和二十二个生产队长，识字以后，能够用生产指示数来管理社里的生产，加强了工作的计划性。
    在已经摘掉文盲帽子的职工和干部中，有二十八万人分别由高小、初中、高中班毕了业。全省区级以上的干部中，已经没有一个文盲了。
    党和政府一贯关怀扫盲工作。在各市县，都建立了扫盲委员会的机构，领导这一工作。全省专职领导农民业余教育的干部有一千多人，已经组成的扫盲大军有十万余人，其中一万一千四百多人，获得扫盲积极分子的称号。在城市，几乎是所有的厂矿、机关、街道都成立了正规的业余文化学校，许多厂矿抽调了中层领导干部担任业余文化学校的领导。各级党组织和行政、工会，都保证职工的业余文化学习时间不受侵占，还积极解决经费、校舍、教学设备等具体问题，为职工的业余文化学习创造物质条件。
    在党和政府的关怀下，解放了的工人、农民学习文化的热情非常高。各地农民都适应农村生产情况，采取“大忙不学、小忙少学、不忙多学”的方针，坚持不懈地学习。今年春，全省紧张抗旱，还有三十七万农民坚持学习。合作化后，参加学习的农民超过合作化前的两倍以上。从1955年冬合作化高潮到现在，全省一共扫除农民文盲八十万人，而前六年共扫除了三十万文盲。在城市，全省目前有六十三万三千多厂矿职工和十四万七千多党政群众团体机关干部参加文化学习。沈阳市参加学习的共有二十二万五千多人，比1949年增加了九倍。
    根据现有材料预计，到今年年底全省还可扫除十万农民文盲，使摘掉文盲帽子的农民增加到一百二十万人，超过第一个五年计划20％。
