Soon after the Ministry of Communications entered the third stage of the rectification campaign, someone posted a big-character poster criticizing Jing Renqiu, the president of the Water Transport Science Academy, for his work style. Because this big-character poster was unsigned and the wording was rather sharp, it aroused opposition from many comrades. They put up big-character posters to criticize the anonymous person, questioning him, "Why don't you sign your name?" "Why don't you dare to stand up?" and so on.

The purpose of using big-character posters to offer opinions is to enable everyone to speak their minds without any reservations, to expose shortcomings and mistakes in work and leadership, and then to facilitate corrections. Therefore, anyone who puts forward an opinion should be welcomed.

The fact that people are unwilling to sign their names when posting big-character posters precisely shows that some people still have concerns when offering opinions to leading cadres. In this case, if the opinion is correct, it should be accepted and corrected, and practical actions should be taken to eliminate these people's concerns so that they dare to express their opinions. If the opinion is incorrect, at a certain time, for example, after mass debate, after thorough rectification, these people will also realize the error of their opinion. There is no need to investigate the person who offered the opinion just because they did not sign their name, and insist that they "stand up."

After discovering this problem, the Ministry of Communications' Rectification Leadership Group adopted a completely correct attitude and immediately explained the above principles to the masses. This not only quelled a storm but also dispelled the concerns of some people. Since then, unsigned big-character posters have not appeared in the Ministry of Communications.

    不署名也不必追查
    交通部转入整风第三阶段后不久，有人贴出一张大字报，对水运科学院靖任秋院长的作风提出了批评。这张大字报没有署名，同时词句比较尖锐，因此，引起了许多同志的反对。他们贴出大字报，对匿名者提出批评，质问他“为何不具名？”“为何不敢站出来？”等等。
    用大字报提意见，目的是为了使每个人都能毫无顾忌地说出自己心里的话，使工作中和领导上的缺点和错误得以揭露，然后便于改正。因此，不管任何人，只要把意见提出来，就应该欢迎。
    贴大字报而不愿署名，这正说明，有些人在给领导干部提意见时还有顾虑。在这种情况下，如果意见正确，就应当接受下来，加以改正，用实际行动来消除这些人的顾虑，使他们敢于提出自己的意见。如果意见不正确，到了一定时候，比如说，经过群众辩论，经过彻底整改，这些人也会认识自己意见的错误。尽可不必为了没有署名这一件事，去追查提意见的人，一定要叫他“站出来”。
    交通部整风领导小组发现这一问题后，采取了完全正确的态度，立即向群众说明了上述的道理。这不但平息了一场风波，同时也解除了一些人的顾虑。从这以后，交通部再未出现过不署名的大字报。
