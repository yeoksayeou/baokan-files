Xinhua News Agency, 14th dispatch: The rectification movement in the Ministry of Communications has developed rapidly since entering the third stage. After the ministry conducted a comprehensive rectification mobilization report on November 1st, the masses were in high spirits. On the afternoon of the same day, 1,258 big-character posters were posted, and within a few days, a high tide of speaking out was set off. As of the 12th, a total of 11,681 big-character posters had been posted in the ministry, raising 13,743 opinions, with an average of more than four posters per person. In some units, the average was ten posters per person, and the most was fifty-four posters. In many units, 100% of the people posted big-character posters. Many major problems existing in the work of the Ministry of Communications, including the system and organization, business policies, cadre work, wages and benefits, and the leadership style of leaders at all levels, have been raised with many opinions, criticisms, or suggestions in the big-character posters.

The big-character posters criticized the Ministry of Communications for its weak leadership in local transportation in recent years. Civilian transportation tools are a significant transportation force in our country, but the Ministry of Communications has not adequately studied and guided this work in the past. The big-character posters of the Highway General Bureau criticized that the cost of highways built by the central government is higher than that of local governments. For the same sixth-grade highway, the cost per kilometer built by the engineering departments of the Highway General Bureau is sometimes more than twice as high as that built by local governments. The big-character posters also pointed out that highway construction work has often been busy, chaotic, and passive in recent years, mainly because of the lack of a complete highway network plan. The big-character posters of the Haihe Transportation Bureau criticized that due to the bureaucracy of the leadership and the departmentalism of the lower levels, the direct sea-river transportation that started to be called for in 1954 has not been well implemented until now, resulting in increased transshipment of goods in Shanghai Port, waste of transportation capacity, failure to reduce costs, and increased burden on Shanghai Port. The big-character posters of various departments also sharply exposed and criticized the Ministry of Communications for its bloated organization, overstaffing, serious subjectivism, bureaucratic leadership style, and the illegal and undisciplined behavior of some Party member cadres.

According to the person in charge of the Rectification Office of the Ministry of Communications, the high tide of speaking out in the Ministry of Communications came relatively quickly, mainly because: (1) The organization of speaking out this time was preceded by a more thorough mobilization. The leaders of the ministry conducted repeated mobilization in all general meetings and Party cadre meetings, as well as symposiums of democratic parties and senior technicians. The leaders of each bureau also conducted multiple mobilizations among Party members, League members, and the general masses, constantly breaking down concerns; (2) In the process of the anti-Rightist struggle, two comprehensive debate meetings were organized, which greatly helped the masses distinguish between major rights and wrongs and minor rights and wrongs. Therefore, once the concerns were dispelled, the enthusiasm of the masses was very high; (3) The speaking out in the first stage of rectification was insufficient, and there was no call to post big-character posters, while the Ministry of Communications had accumulated many problems over the years, and the masses had many opinions; (4) The experience of other advanced units was absorbed. At the same time, because the entire scope of the Ministry of Communications entered the third stage simultaneously, the units influenced and promoted each other, which also had a great impact on the rapid formation of the high tide.

The person in charge also said that in order to encourage the masses to criticize our work and leadership style without any hesitation and to resolutely implement the spirit of the central government's bold release, resolute release, thorough release, and bold rectification, resolute rectification, and thorough rectification, we promptly corrected some problems that emerged in the speaking out, such as insufficient enthusiasm of the leaders of individual units or insufficient release of speaking out, especially some phenomena that hindered the speaking out. After the Highway General Bureau publicly criticized the Director of the Labor and Wage Department, Jie Shu, for suppressing criticism, the enthusiasm of the masses was greatly aroused, and dozens of big-character posters were posted to criticize Jie Shu for his subjectivism, bureaucracy, failure to delve into business, and suppression of criticism.

In the high tide of speaking out, in addition to repeated mobilization by the leadership to break down concerns, the ministry also adopted the method of using radio broadcasts to report on the development of the movement and the progress of rectification work, and also issued mimeographed "Rectification Briefings" to report on the dynamics of speaking out, promptly encouraging the enthusiasm of the masses to speak out, and correcting some deviations that hindered the speaking out.

    贴出大字报一万一千多张　提出意见一万三千多条
    交通部转入整改立即形成鸣放高潮
    新华社14日讯  交通部的整风运动在进入第三阶段以后，发展很快。这个部在11月1日进行全部性的整改动员报告以后，群众的情绪很高，当天下午便贴出大字报一千二百五十八张，没有几天鸣放的高潮就掀起来了。截至12日的统计，这个部的大字报总共已贴出一万一千六百八十一张，提出意见一万三千七百四十三条，平均每人贴了四张以上，有的单位平均每人十张，最多的一人贴了五十四张。不少单位是百分之百的人贴了大字报。交通部工作中存在的许多重大问题，包括体制机构、业务方针、干部工作、工资福利和各级领导干部的领导作风等等，大字报上都提出了许多意见、批评或建议。
    大字报批评了交通部几年来对地方交通运输的领导薄弱。民间运输工具在我国是一支很大的运输力量，交通部领导上过去没有很好地研究和指导这项工作。公路总局的大字报批评了中央建筑的公路造价比地方高，同样修六级的公路，公路总局工程部门修的每公里造价有的比地方修的高一倍以上。大字报还指出：几年来公路建设工作常常忙乱被动，主要原因是缺乏完善的公路网规划。海河运输局的大字报批评了由于领导上的官僚主义和下面的本位主义，从1954年就开始喊的江海直达运输一直到现在还没有很好的搞起来，结果增加了货物在上海港的转口，浪费了运力，成本不能降低，并增加了上海港的负担。各个部门的大字报还尖锐地揭露和批评了交通部机构臃肿、人浮于事，严重的主观主义、官僚主义的领导作风和某些党员干部的违法乱纪行为。
    据交通部整风办公室负责人说，交通部鸣放高潮来得较快，其主要原因是：（一）此次组织鸣放事先动员较为深入，部的领导在全部大会和党内干部会以及各民主党派、高级技术人员座谈会中进行了反复动员，各局的领导也在党、团员及一般群众中作了多次动员，不断打破顾虑；（二）在反右派斗争过程中曾组织了两次全部性的大辩论会，对帮助群众分清大是大非和小是小非的界限有很大帮助，所以一旦解除顾虑，群众热情便很高；（三）整风第一阶段鸣放不够，没有号召贴大字报，而交通部多年来积累的问题较多，群众意见也不少；（四）吸收其他各先进单位的经验。同时又因为交通部全部范围是同时转入第三阶段的，所以各单位之间互相影响，互相推动，对高潮的迅速形成也有很大影响。
    负责人又说，为了使群众对我们工作和领导作风中的各种问题和缺点，毫无顾虑地提出批评，坚决贯彻中央大胆地放、坚决地放、彻底地放和大胆地改、坚决地改、彻底地改的精神，我们对鸣放中出现的一些问题，如个别单位领导劲头不足或对鸣放不够放手，特别是一些阻碍鸣放的现象，都及时加以纠正。公路总局公开批评了局劳动工资处处长解舒压制批评的行动后，群众情绪大为兴奋，纷纷贴出几十张大字报批评解舒主观主义、官僚主义，不深入钻研业务以及压制批评等缺点。
    这个部在鸣放高潮中，除领导上反复动员打破顾虑外，还采取了用广播报道运动发展情况及整改工作进行情况，还发行了油印的“整改简报”报道鸣放动态，及时鼓励群众鸣放热情，并纠正某些阻碍鸣放的偏向。
