    Shaking Off Vagrancy and Begging
    Blind People Actively Participate in Production
    (Our report) In the old society, blind people were considered disabled and useless, but with the development of our country's socialist construction, they are gradually changing their outlook.
    Blind people who used to live by wandering, begging, fortune-telling, and singing are now, under the care and support of the Party and the government, being organized to engage in various kinds of production. Currently, there are fifty-six blind people's production units in cities across the country, with a total of one thousand five hundred and fifty-nine blind people participating in production. The products include rattan ware, bamboo ware, sweaters, paper boxes, iron nails, and more than thirty other kinds of daily necessities and cultural products. These production organizations currently take four forms: The first is the blind people's teaching factory, which is a new type of factory using machine production. Such blind people's production factories have already been established in Shenyang and Dalian. Shanghai is also preparing to establish such a blind people's factory. In the Shenyang Blind People's Teaching Factory, sixty blind people are participating in production. Their monthly wage income is up to sixty yuan, and at least twenty yuan, generally between thirty-five yuan and forty yuan. This factory produces an average of thirty tons of various specifications of wire nails per month, with a total monthly output value of about thirty thousand yuan. The second form is production groups or cooperatives. There are such blind people's production units in twenty-eight cities including Beijing, Tianjin, Qingdao, Hohhot, and Xining. These blind people's production organizations are all handicraft productions that have gradually developed from small to large. For example, the Qingdao Blind People's Rattan Ware Production Group had only five blind people when it was established in 1953, but has now grown to forty-one people. They can weave rattan beds, rattan chairs, rattan boxes, and other rattan furniture and daily necessities. The total output value in the past four years has been more than 95,000 yuan, with more than 25,000 yuan in wages paid out, and more than 3,000 yuan in accumulated funds. The highest wage for group members is fifty yuan, and the lowest is twenty yuan, basically without the need for government relief. The third form is the self-reliance group of the blind people's sanatorium. For example, the Fuzhou Blind People's Sanatorium adopts the method of classified care for the received blind people, focusing on providing for the old and weak, organizing blind children to learn culture and production skills, and clearly proposing the slogan of striving for self-reliance for young and middle-aged people. The fourth form is the use of impoverished people's production units to arrange for blind people. For example, Nankai District in Tianjin has adopted this method, organizing almost all the blind people with labor ability in the district into impoverished people's production groups.
    In June of this year, the China Blind Welfare Association held an exhibition of blind people's finished products in Beihai Park, Beijing. More than 200 blind people's products from seventeen cities were exhibited at this exhibition, including various rattan wares, colorful woolen clothes, sturdy and durable bamboo teapot shells, exquisite and beautiful handmade grass bags, various specifications of wire nails, as well as various daily necessities, children's toys, and cultural products. There were also five-tube radios assembled by blind people. Visitors expressed surprise and praise for the wisdom and talent of the blind people.
    However, the participation of blind people in production is only a beginning. There are about 1.5 to 1.6 million blind people in the country, and only one in a thousand is currently participating in production. In order to further develop blind people's production so that the majority of young and middle-aged blind people can contribute their strength to socialist construction, the China Blind Welfare Association has convened a special meeting to conduct research, proposing to actively and appropriately develop this work according to local conditions, hoping that the Party and government departments in various regions will attach importance to the leadership of this work, and hoping that the handicraft management departments will give due support.

### 摆脱流浪乞讨的生活  盲人积极参加生产

    摆脱流浪乞讨的生活
    盲人积极参加生产
    本报讯　在旧社会中被看作残废无用的盲人，随着我国社会主义建设的发展，逐渐改变着自己的面貌。
    过去曾经以流浪、乞讨、算命，卖唱为生的盲人，今天在党和政府的关怀和支持下，一部分已经组织起来从事各种各样的生产。现在全国各城市已有五十六个盲人生产单位，参加生产的盲人共有一千五百五十九人。生产品种有藤器、竹器、毛衣、纸盒、铁钉及其他生活及文化用品三十多种。这些生产组织目前有四种形式：第一种是盲人教学工厂，这是采用机器生产的新型的工厂，在沈阳和大连已经建立了这样的盲人生产工厂。上海也准备建立这样的盲人工厂。在沈阳盲人教学工厂里，有六十名盲人参加了生产。他们的工资收入每月最高为六十元，最少为二十元，一般在三十五元到四十元之间。这个厂每月平均生产三十吨不同规格的洋钉，月产总值约三万元左右。第二种是生产组或合作社的形式，在北京、天津、青岛、呼和浩特、西宁等二十八个城市都有这样的盲人生产单位。这些盲人生产组织都是由小到大逐步发展起来的手工业生产。如青岛盲人藤器生产组，1953年成立时只有五个盲人，现在已发展到四十一人。他们能够编制藤床、藤椅、藤箱及其他藤制家具和日用品。四年来的生产总值为九万五千多元，发出工资两万五千多元，并积累了三千多元的资金。组员的工资最高为五十元，最低为二十元，基本上不需要政府救济。第三种是盲人教养院的自食其力小组的形式。如福州盲人教养院对收容的盲人采取分类教养的办法，对老弱以养为主，对盲童组织学习文化和生产技能，对青壮年则明确的提出争取自食其力的口号。第四种是利用贫民生产单位安排盲人的形式。如天津市南开区采用了这个办法，几乎把全区有劳动力的盲人都组织在贫民生产组中。
    今年6月间，中国盲人福利会在北京北海公园举办了一次盲人生产成品展览会。在这次展览会上展出了十七个城市的盲人生产品二百余件，有各式各样的藤器，有花丽鲜艳的毛线衣服，有坚固耐用的竹壶壳，有精致美观的手提草包，有各种规格的洋钉以及各种日用品、儿童玩具和文化用品。还有盲人装制的五灯收音机。参观者对盲人的智慧和才能表示惊讶和称赞。
    但盲人参加生产，目前还只是个开端，全国盲人约一百五、六十万，现在参加生产的不过千分之一。为了进一步开展盲人生产，使广大青壮年盲人能够在社会主义建设中贡献出他们的力量，中国盲人福利会曾召集了专门会议进行研究，提出要积极地因地制宜地开展这项工作，希望各地党政部门重视这一工作的领导，希望手工业管理部门给以应有的支持。
