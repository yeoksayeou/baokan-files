Xinhua News Agency, 18th - Peng Zhen, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and Mayor of Beijing, said in a broadcast speech to the Czechoslovak people that the death of President Antonín Zápotocký was a great loss to the people of Czechoslovakia, the people of all socialist countries, the working people of the world, and the cause of world peace. The Chinese people express their deepest condolences to the Czechoslovak people with great sorrow.

Peng Zhen made the broadcast speech at the invitation of Prague Radio on the death of President Antonín Zápotocký. Prague Radio broadcast the speech to the entire Czechoslovak people today.

In his broadcast speech, Peng Zhen said that President Antonín Zápotocký was a loyal communist who dedicated his life to the liberation struggle and socialist construction of the Czechoslovak people, and to the cause of the international workers' movement and the maintenance of world peace. From our usual understanding of him, and from the direct contact we had with him during the visit to Czechoslovakia last year by myself and our delegation of the National People's Congress and the delegation of the Beijing Municipal People's Committee, we deeply felt his close concern for the lives of the working people, his close ties with the working people, his proletarian and simple style, and his high degree of proletarian internationalism. All of these left a deep impression on us. Our beloved Comrade Zápotocký has passed away, but his spirit will be immortal among the working people of the world.

Peng Zhen said that in the past few days, the Czechoslovak people, our Chinese people, and the vast working people of the world have been saddened by the death of President Zápotocký. But sorrow will turn into strength. In his speech, Peng Zhen expressed his deep conviction that the cause pursued by President Zápotocký will continue to be thoroughly implemented by the Czechoslovak people under the leadership of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, and will achieve greater victories.
