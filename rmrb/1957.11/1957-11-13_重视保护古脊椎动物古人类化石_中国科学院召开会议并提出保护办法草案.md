    Emphasize Protecting Fossil Vertebrates and Paleoanthropological Fossils
    Chinese Academy of Sciences Convenes Meeting and Proposes Draft Protection Measures

    (Our report) The Chinese Academy of Sciences, following the instructions of the State Council, convened a meeting on the protection of fossil vertebrates and paleoanthropological fossils in Beijing from November 9th to 10th. Representatives from relevant departments such as the Academy of Sciences, the Ministry of Culture, the Ministry of Geology, the Ministry of Health, and the Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine participated in the meeting.

    Fossil vertebrates and paleoanthropological fossils are the remains of ancient organisms preserved in strata. They are the main basis for geologists to identify and compare strata and understand the history of the Earth. They are valuable materials for biologists, paleontologists, and anthropologists to study the origin of animals and humans, the process and laws of historical development, and have significant value in scientific theoretical research and practical application. China's underground reserves of fossil vertebrates and human fossils are quite rich. The Peking Man, Bienotherium, Lufengosaurus, dinosaur eggs, and recently discovered fossils of Sivapithecus and Gigantopithecus fossils that have been found in the past have received widespread international attention.

    Before liberation, scientific institutions in many capitalist countries, such as the United States, France, and Japan, sent expeditions or scientists to China to plunder paleontological materials for research. Since liberation, thanks to the attention paid to science and culture by the Party and the government, the long-standing neglect and destruction of fossils has been fundamentally changed. The Chinese Academy of Sciences has set up special institutions to collect, preserve, and study these materials. The State Council also issued instructions in 1953 and 1956 respectively on protecting cultural relics in basic construction projects and on protecting cultural relics in agricultural production and construction.

    At present, most local governments can pay attention to the protection of fossils in accordance with the spirit of national laws and regulations; however, the phenomenon of destroying fossils is still relatively serious in some areas. Because the Chinese people have traditionally used fossil teeth and bones (dragon teeth and dragon bones) as medicinal materials to treat diseases, pharmaceutical companies annually assign a considerable number of purchase tasks. In recent years, provinces and regions such as Shanxi, Anhui, and Inner Mongolia often have thousands of farmers abandoning legitimate agricultural production and rushing to excavate fossils.

    The representatives attending the meeting studied the above situation and believed that although China's fossil vertebrates and human fossils are quite rich, if they are not protected and are arbitrarily mined, then soon, China's relevant scientific institutions and museums will have no materials available for research or display, and the source of "dragon bones" and "dragon teeth" supplied for medical applications will also be cut off.

    In order to protect fossil vertebrates and human fossils from being destroyed, the meeting discussed the "Measures for the Protection of Fossil Vertebrates and Human Fossils" draft proposed by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, unanimously agreed with the basic content of the draft, and designated a special group composed of relevant ministries and academies to specifically study it and submit it to the State Council for review, approval, and promulgation. The draft embodies the spirit of protecting scientific materials while meeting medical needs, and believes that it is illegal to privately excavate "dragon bones" without the participation and guidance of relevant cultural and scientific departments, and this must be stopped. The meeting pointed out that the great significance of fossil vertebrates and human fossils in scientific research should be widely publicized among the people of the country, so that the people can pay attention to the protection of fossils.

    重视保护古脊椎动物古人类化石
    中国科学院召开会议并提出保护办法草案
    本报讯　中国科学院根据国务院的指示，于11月9日至10日在北京召开关于古脊椎动物和古人类化石的保护会议。参加会议的有科学院、文化部、地质部、卫生部、中医研究院等有关方面代表。
    古脊椎动物和古人类化石是保存在地层中的古代生物的遗骸。它是地质工作者鉴定和对比地层、了解地球历史的主要根据；是生物学家、古生物学家和人类学家研究动物和人类的起源、历史发展的过程与规律的珍贵材料，在科学的理论研究和实际应用上，都有重大价值。我国地下蕴藏的古脊椎动物化石和人类化石相当丰富，过去发现的中国猿人、卞氏兽、禄丰恐龙、恐龙蛋等以及最近发现的森林古猿、华南巨猿等化石，受到国际上的普遍重视。
    在解放以前，许多资本主义国家如美、法、日等国的科学机构，都曾派遣考察队或科学家竞相前来我国，抢劫古生物材料进行研究。解放以来，由于党和政府对科学文化事业的重视，过去长期以来存在的对化石不重视和破坏的情况有了根本改变，中国科学院设置了专门机构从事这方面材料的收集、保管和研究。国务院并在1953年和1956年分别发布了关于在基本建设工程中保护文物和关于在农业生产建设中保护文物的指示。
    目前大部分地方政府都能根据国家法令的精神，注意保护化石；但也有部分地区破坏化石的现象还比较严重。由于我国人民向以化石牙齿和骨骼（龙齿和龙骨）作为药材治病，药材公司每年布置相当数量的收购任务。最近几年来，山西、安徽、内蒙古等省区经常有成千农民荒废了正当的农业生产，争相挖掘化石。
    到会的代表们研究了上述情况，认为我国古脊椎动物和人类化石虽然相当丰富，如果不加保护，任意采掘，则不久以后，我国有关科学机构和博物馆将无可供研究或陈列的材料，而供给医疗应用的“龙骨”和“龙齿”也将断绝来源。
    为了保护古脊椎动物和古人类化石不致受到破坏，会议就中国科学院提出的“保护古脊椎动物和古人类化石办法”草案进行了讨论，一致同意这个草案的基本内容，并指定由有关部、院组成专门小组，具体研究后呈请国务院审查、批准后公布施行。草案体现了既能保护科学材料又能满足医药需要的精神，认为未经有关文化科学部门参加指导而私行发掘“龙骨”是违法的行为，必须加以制止。会议指出，关于古脊椎动物和古人类化石在科学研究上的重大意义，应在全国人民中广泛宣传，使人民重视化石的保护工作。
