Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 2nd. The "1958 Astronomical Almanac," newly compiled by the Purple Mountain Observatory of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, was published at the end of October. This astronomical almanac includes calendars, the sun, moon, planets, stars, and other sections, recording the daily movement and orientation of the sun, moon, and stars, as well as important astronomical phenomena that will occur in the sky next year. For example, it is already known that an annular solar eclipse will occur on April 19th next year, a partial lunar eclipse on May 3rd, and a total solar eclipse on October 13th. The times and locations where they can be seen have been calculated (the first two are visible within China).

The astronomical almanac provides essential basic figures for astronomical work and engineering surveying and is a necessary reference material for construction. In old China, due to poor conditions, only ten years' worth of astronomical almanacs were published in the nearly forty years before liberation. The content was simple, and the circulation was very small. After liberation, astronomical science has seen tremendous growth in personnel and equipment. Since 1951, astronomical almanacs have been compiled annually, and the content has been continuously enriched and improved. The number of copies issued has increased year by year, with the number issued in 1957 being more than twelve times that of 1951.

    1958年天文年历出版
    据新华社南京2日电　中国科学院紫金山天文台新编的“1958年天文年历”已在10月底出版。这种天文年历包括日历、太阳、月亮、行星、恒星等部分，记载着明年日月星辰每天的运动方位以及天空中将要发生的重要天象。如已经预知明年4月19日将发生日环食，5月3日有月偏食，10月13日有日全食，并且算出了时刻和能够看到的地点（前两者在我国境内可见）。
    天文年历为天文工作和工程测量提供了必需的基本数字，是进行建设必不可少的一种参考资料。在旧中国，编历工作由于条件恶劣，解放前的将近四十年中，总共只出版过十年的天文年历，内容简单，发行额极少。解放后，天文科学在人员和设备等方面都有了极大的增长，从1951年起按年编制天文年历，内容也不断充实改进，发行册数逐年增加，1957年发行数为1951年的十二倍多。
