I Became a Worker
Wang Yannian, Former Engineer of Tianjin Paper Mill

I used to be an engineer at the state-owned Tianjin Paper Mill. After the Party issued the call to "Go to the labor front!", I voluntarily signed up to be among the first group of people sent down to the workshops to work as a worker. From October 23rd until now, I have gone from being unaccustomed to physical labor to gradually becoming accustomed to it, and I have felt the joy of labor. However, in this revolutionary action, my ideological changes have been very complex, and it can be said that I have had intense ideological struggles.

Glory Does Not Lie in the Rank of the Position

Usually, I knew in theory the importance of combining mental and physical labor. But in my daily work, I was often impractical and unable to solve small problems, let alone big ones, which often made me feel distressed. The anti-Rightist struggle raised my awareness. I thought that people like me, who come from petty-bourgeois families and whose thinking has not been well-transformed, still have many erroneous ideas that conflict with socialist ideas. Therefore, when the call to go down was made, I thought that I could not miss the opportunity and wanted to go to the workers' ranks to transform myself, so I signed up to go down. However, at this time, my thinking still fluctuated greatly. In terms of position, I was promoted from trainee technician to shift commander, and then to workshop director; in terms of technology, I was promoted from technician to engineer. In the old society, there was a saying: "People go to high places, and water flows to low places." The so-called "going to high places" refers to my situation. Now, I am going to participate in physical labor, what will the social opinion be of me? Among my relatives, there are university vice-chancellors and scientific researchers, and among my classmates, there are doctors, engineers, and more lecturers and teaching assistants, while I will be an ordinary worker. In comparison, … I hesitated. I also thought that my wife is engaged in musical work, and the family life is full of intellectual atmosphere, while I will become a worker, how uncoordinated it will seem! My determination even began to waver. It was at this time that the Party and comrades helped me. I recalled the principles mentioned by the Party Committee Secretary in the mobilization meeting: The new society's view of physical labor is fundamentally different from that of the old society, which made me further criticize this bourgeois vanity and realize that true glory does not lie in the rank of the position, but in the magnitude of the contribution to the people. Now the factory has such a bloated organization, and every day, in addition to meetings, it is trapped in a sea of ​​affairs, floating on it all day long, unable to do much. Is it glorious to be such an engineer? No! It is glorious to be a person who actually participates in labor. If someone looks at me with old eyes, then there is something wrong with his thinking. So, my determination to go down became even greater, and I chose the most difficult section of the factory, the roasting furnace section, to work as a worker.

You Can't Appreciate it Without Working

On October 23rd, I officially went to work at the roasting furnace. This was an unforgettable day in my life. On this day, the workshop was undergoing a major overhaul, and the workers were working very hard, but they all greeted me with smiles. I followed everyone's advice and first familiarized myself with the surrounding environment. I saw the workers replacing the raking teeth on the roasting furnace. This equipment was difficult to replace due to the high-temperature fusion. When I saw the workers exerting themselves, it was as if I was exerting myself, so I suggested using tools to remove the raking teeth. The workers immediately accepted my suggestion, and the work efficiency was more than doubled, and everyone was happy. Someone also wrote a broadcast draft, praising me. This matter seems small, but it has great educational significance for a person who has been high above for a long time. At that time, I thought of another thing: the workers working on the hoisting machine in this workshop have to load two tons of ore every thirty minutes, which is very laborious. In the past, the workers had raised this issue, and there was also ready-made experience in the country, which could effectively reduce the labor intensity of the workers. However, the situation of the hoisting machine has not changed. In the previous period, this work was my responsibility. Therefore, people who have not participated in actual labor are difficult to deeply understand the hardships of workers' labor, and will not care about the workers' sufferings. I couldn't appreciate this in the past.

Sharing Weal and Woe, Learning From Each Other

In work, the workers take care of me in many ways, and I also actively learn from them, making it easier to get along; but how to shorten the ideological distance is something I always pay attention to. When the workers in our workshop wash their hands after work, there are only two basins of water. To take care of me, the workers took the initiative to give me a basin of clean water. I thought that this was the distance created between the workers and staff in the past because intellectuals looked down on manual labor, so I insisted on washing my hands with everyone. In other aspects, I also strive to share weal and woe with the workers. For example, after a few days of physical labor, I felt soreness in my back; at the same time, because of the shift work, I could not go home every day, and I felt very unaccustomed to it. However, when I saw the hard work of the workers, they did not bargain in their work and showed a high degree of responsibility, I realized that this was the laziness of the intellectuals. To transform myself, I must learn this noble quality from the workers. So, I started to get used to this kind of labor.

After these days of working together, I get along very well with the workers. They are sincere and frank to me, and I do not beat around the bush with them. Once, I said to the veteran workers: "In terms of address, I am used to calling Lao Zhang, Lao Li, and I can't change it for a while. Can I not call you master?" Everyone laughed. The veteran workers said: "Of course, we will learn from each other in the future! I hope you can teach us theoretical knowledge." In this way, we established a system of mutual learning. They taught me operational experience, and I also used the spare time before the handover to regularly explain technical theory to everyone. (Excerpted from Tianjin Daily)

    我当了工人
    原国营天津造纸总厂工程师　王延年
    我原是国营天津造纸总厂的工程师，当党发出“到劳动战线上去！”的号召以后，我是自愿报名在第一批下放到车间去当工人的。由上月23日到现在，我对于体力劳动已经由不习惯到逐渐习惯了，并且感到了劳动的愉快。但是，在这次革命的行动中，我的思想变化是很复杂的，可以说有过激烈的思想斗争。
    光荣不在于职位高低
    平时，我在理论上也知道脑力劳动和体力劳动相结合的重要性。但是在日常工作中，却经常是眼高手低，小问题看不见，大问题又解决不了，常常因此感到苦恼。经过反右派斗争，提高了我的认识。我想，像我这样出身小资产阶级家庭，思想没有经过很好改造的人，还有不少错误思想是和社会主义思想抵触的。因此，当下放的号召提出以后，我就想机会不能错过，愿意到工人队伍里去改造自己，于是就报名要求下放。但是，这时我的思想上仍有很大的波动。在职位上，我由见习技术员升到值班指挥员，又升到车间主任；在技术上是由技术员升到工程师。旧社会有一句俗话：“人往高处走，水往低处流”，所谓“往高处走”，就是指我这种情况说的。现在，我要去参加体力劳动了，社会舆论会对我有什么看法呢？在我的亲戚中，既有大学副校长，也有科学研究员，在同学中有的是医生、工程师，更多的是讲师和助教，而我将是一个普通的工人，相形之下，……我犹豫了。又想到我的爱人是搞音乐工作的，家庭生活充满了知识分子的气氛，而我将成为一个工人，会显得多么不协调啊！我的决心甚至开始动摇了。就在这时候，党和同志们帮助了我，我回忆起党委书记在动员会上的报告中所讲的道理：新社会对体力劳动的看法和旧社会是根本不同的，使我进一步批判了这种资产阶级的虚荣心，认识到真正的光荣不在于职位的高低，而在于对人民的贡献大小。现在厂里机构这么臃肿，每天除了会议就陷在事务的海洋里，整日浮在上面，做不了多少事。难道做这样一个工程师光荣吗？不是！做一个实际参加劳动的人，才是光荣的。如果有人用旧眼光看我，那正是他的思想有问题。于是，我下去的决心又大了，并且选择了我厂工作环境最艰苦的焙烧炉工段去当工人。
    不劳动就体会不到
    10月23日，我正式到焙烧炉去上工了。这是我一生难忘的一天。这天，车间正值中修，工人劳动很紧张，但都对我笑脸相迎。我遵从大家的意见，首先去熟悉周围的环境。我看见工人们正在换焙烧炉上的扒齿。这项设备于由高温的熔结，换起来很吃力。我看到工人们使劲的情形，就像费了我自己的力气一样，于是我建议使用工具将扒齿卸开。工人马上接受了我的建议，工作效率提高了一倍多，大家都乐了。有人还写了广播稿，表扬了我。这件事看来不大，但对于一个过去长期高高在上的人来说，有着很大的教育意义。当时我就想起另外一件事情：在这个车间吊矿机上工作的工人，每三十分钟要装完两吨矿石，十分吃力。过去工人提出过这个问题，而且国内也有现成的经验，可以有效地减轻工人的劳动强度。但是，吊矿机的情况一直没有改变。前一个时期，这项工作就是由我负责的。所以，没有参加过实际劳动的人，很难深刻地了解到工人劳动中的艰苦，也就不会关心工人劳动中的疾苦。这点，我过去是体会不到的。
    同甘共苦、互相学习
    在工作上，工人们多方面地照顾我，我也主动向他们学习，比较容易打成一片；但是怎样缩短思想上的距离，却是我时刻注意的事。我们车间工人下班后洗手时，只有两盆水，工人为照顾我，主动让给我一盆干净的。我想这是由于过去知识分子轻视体力劳动，在职工之间造成的距离，于是坚持和大家一起洗手。在其他方面，我也努力和工人同甘共苦。如在经过几天体力劳动以后，腰酸背疼；同时因为倒班的关系，也不能每天回家，我觉得很不习惯。但是，当我看到工人那种艰苦劳动，工作中不讲价钱，表现有高度责任心的时候，我便意识到这就是知识分子内心中好逸恶劳的劣根性在作祟。要改造自己，就必须向工人学习这种高贵的品质。于是，我开始习惯这种劳动了。
    经过这些天的共同劳动，我和工人相处得很融洽，他们对我热诚坦率，我和他们也不绕圈子。有一次，我对老师傅们说：“在称呼上，我平时老张、老李地叫惯了，一时改不过来，我不叫师傅行不行？”逗得大家都笑了。老师傅们说：“当然可以，以后我们还要互相学习呢！希望你教我们理论知识。”这样，我们就订立了互学的制度，他们将操作经验教给我，我也利用交接班前的一段空闲时间，定期为大家讲解技术理论知识。　（摘编自天津日报）
