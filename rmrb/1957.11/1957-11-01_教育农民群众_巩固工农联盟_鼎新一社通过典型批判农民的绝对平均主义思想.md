(Reported by reporter Zhen Weimin) The Dingxin First Cooperative in Jingjiang County, Jiangsu Province, launched a major debate on the question of whether or not to have a worker-peasant alliance, in connection with some incorrect ideas among the members. During the debate, the absolute egalitarianism represented by newly-risen middle peasant Wang Genbao was criticized, enabling all cadres and masses of the cooperative to establish the idea of relying on the worker-peasant alliance to build socialism. The debate began with the grain issue. A group of people, headed by the newly-risen middle peasant Wang Genbao, believed that: the state takes care of the workers and bullies the peasants, and the Communist Party forgets the peasants after entering the city. They believed that the grain standards for urban populations and workers should be lowered to increase the supply of pig feed in rural areas. At the cooperative members' congress, many people agreed with his opinion. At this time, Liu Yuhua, the accountant of the third team and a poor peasant, refuted this by comparing the grain consumption of a five-member family in urban and rural areas: "An average urban five-member family consumes 283 jin of grain per person per year, while a rural five-member family consumes an average of 376 jin of rice per person this year, 93 jin more per person than the urban population." Can the grain supply standards for workers and urban populations be reduced to solve the problem of grain and pig feed for peasants? Everyone then calculated: There are 25 million workers in the country. If each worker eats 20 jin less rice a year, a total of 500 million jin would be saved. Each of the 500 million peasants would only get an increase of one jin. If nearly 100 million urban residents in the country each reduced their consumption by 10 jin per year, each peasant would only receive 2 jin. Therefore, relying on lowering the grain supply to urban populations or workers cannot solve the fundamental problem. Poor peasant Hou Tianyou said, "According to this calculation, the workers' grain ration is actually not as much as ours. The state does not bully us, but takes care of us. We cannot make false accusations." Wang Genbao reluctantly admitted that the state takes care of the peasants.

Then Wang Genbao said: "I don't care about the grain issue, but I am not convinced that workers earn more money than peasants. Someone in our dike area works in Shanghai and earns 100 yuan a month, which is equivalent to a farmer working hard for a year." Team accountant Liu Yuhua again used the average income of a five-member worker's family to illustrate that the income gap between workers and peasants is not too large. Wang Genbao said that you are calculating the income of workers earning 50 yuan a month. I have a problem with workers earning 100 yuan a month. Many people said: "There are more than 20 people from our cooperative working outside, but only two of them earn 100 yuan a month. Their skills are high, and their wages should naturally be higher. This cannot represent the general situation." Wang Genbao retorted: "It is precisely because his salary is high and unreasonable that it must be lowered." Wu Yongsheng, a demobilized soldier, questioned Wang Genbao: "How many work points do you earn, and how many work points do the cooperative members who are less physically capable than you earn? If you were asked to earn the same work points as the cooperative members who are less physically capable, would you have any objections?" In order to fundamentally deny the workers' skills, he said: "Let the workers come to farm and see if they can tell the difference between wheat and chives, lotus and taro." Wang Dekun, who had worked for a few days, said: "Wang Genbao, your farming skills are good, but let me ask you, can you build airplanes, ships, and cars? Do you know which mountain has coal and which mountain has iron?" Wang Genbao was speechless and had to admit that his view was wrong, and that building socialism requires relying on peasants, but even more on workers.

Next, everyone focused on debating whether workers can do without peasants and peasants can do without workers, and whether a worker-peasant alliance is necessary. The father of the old middle peasant Wang Dekun said: "Without workers, people will not starve to death in ten days, but without peasants, they will starve to death in ten days." Someone asked what to do if there was no firewood to cook in ten days. Wang Genbao replied: "I can use spark sticks to start a fire." Everyone burst into laughter and said: "If everyone doesn't have fire, where are you going to get spark sticks? Spark sticks are also produced by workers." Zhang Liguo, the captain of the first team, stood up and said: "Cotton cloth, oil, and salt are all produced by workers. If you don't want workers, are you asking us all to wear tree bark, eat raw food, and live like primitive people?" At this time, only Wang Genbao insisted on his opinion, saying: "The worker-peasant alliance must be allied, but I am just not convinced that workers earn too much money." So everyone calculated the example of the Sanyou Food Processing Factory in the county seat (two li away): This factory has 22 workers, and each worker pays an average of 4,818 yuan in profits to the state each year, while each peasant pays only 23.2 yuan in agricultural tax to the state each year. The contribution of each worker to national construction is equivalent to the contribution of more than 100 peasants. Wang Genbao had to admit that the workers' contribution to the country is much greater, and it is right for them to receive slightly more compensation than peasants.

In order to help Wang Genbao thoroughly solve his ideological problems, everyone further helped him find the root causes of his thinking. Wu Yongsheng, a demobilized soldier, said: "Wang Genbao, your idea of wanting to equalize everything regardless of skill level or contribution is a kind of absolute egalitarianism. Think about it, if we first evaluate you and give you the same work points regardless of your labor strength, I guarantee you won't be happy to raise three pigs next year." Du Changsheng, the captain of the third team, enlightened Wang Genbao: "Before liberation, you were also a poor peasant, ate soybean cakes, had no land, let alone raising pigs. After liberation, the Communist Party helped you divide the land, and the state loaned you money to develop production and organize cooperatives. Now you can eat rice and raise three pigs, but now you have forgotten your roots. You only think that the living standards of workers have improved, and you are dissatisfied with the country and the Party. You don't think about how much your own life has changed and how much it has improved. You have forgotten to listen to the Party and rely on the working class." The fact that he ate soybean cakes reminded Wang Genbao of the pain of the past, and he was truly convinced. He said: "That's right, the Party and the state are good to the workers, and they are no different to us peasants. I must listen to the Party in the future." After this debate, Wang Genbao's class consciousness greatly improved, and now he has become an activist in the cooperative's major debate, and he uses practical examples to persuade other members at every debate. After this debate, all members also established the idea of relying on the leadership of the working class and relying on the worker-peasant alliance to build socialism.

    教育农民群众　巩固工农联盟
    鼎新一社通过典型批判农民的绝对平均主义思想
    本报讯　记者甄为民报道：江苏省靖江县鼎新一社联系社员中一些不正确的思想展开了要不要工农联盟的大辩论，辩论中批判了新上中农王根保为代表的绝对平均主义思想，使全社干部群众树立了依靠工农联盟来建设社会主义的思想。辩论是从粮食问题开始的，以新上中农王根保为首的一批人认为：国家照顾工人欺负农民，共产党进了城就忘了农民，他们认为应该降低城市人口和工人的口粮标准，增加农村的猪饲料供应。在全社社员大会上，很多人也同意他的意见。这时三队会计、贫农刘裕华就以城市农村五口之家的用粮对比辩驳说：“城市五口之家大口小口每人平均起来每年吃粮二百八十三斤，而农村五口之家今年每人平均要吃到三百七十六斤大米，每人比城市人口多吃九十三斤。”能不能减少工人和城市人口的粮食供应标准来解决农民的口粮和养猪饲料问题呢？大家又算了一笔账：全国二千五百万工人，每人一年少吃二十斤大米，共五亿斤，五亿农民每人只能增加一斤。如果全国近一亿城市人口，每人每年减少十斤，分给全国农民，每个农民也只能分到二斤。因此依靠降低城市人口或工人的口粮供应并不能解决根本问题。贫农侯天有说：“照这样算来工人口粮实际上还没有我们吃得多，国家并不欺负我们，还是照顾我们的，我们不能说冤枉话。”王根保才勉强承认国家是照顾农民的。
    接着王根保又说：“我在粮食问题上并不计较，但工人拿钱比农民多，我不服气，我们圩上有人在上海做工一个月工资一百元，等于我们一个农民忙一年。”队会计刘裕华又以一个五口之家的工人每人平均收入说明工人和农民的收入距离并不太大。王根保说，你算的是每月五十元工资的工人，我是对一百元工资的工人有意见。许多人说：“本社在外做工的有二十多个，拿一百元工资的只有两个人，他们技术高，拿的工资自然也应该高，这不能代表一般。”王根保辩驳说：“就是因为他工资高，不合理，因此一定要降低。”转业军人吴永生又质问王根保说：“你拿多少工分，比你劳力差的社员拿多少工分，要是叫你也和劳力差的社员拿一样的工分，你有没有意见。”王根保为了根本否认工人的技术，他说：“叫工人来种种田看，保证他连小麦和韭菜、荷花和芋艿都分不清”。做过几天工的王德坤说：“王根保你种田的技术是不错，可是我请问你，你能不能造飞机、轮船、汽车，你知道那个山有煤，那个山有铁？”王根保这才无话可说，不得不承认自己的看法是错误的，建设社会主义要靠农民，更要靠工人。
    接着大家又集中辩论了工人不靠农民，农民不靠工人行不行，要不要工农联盟的问题。老上中农王德坤的父亲说：“十天没有工人不会饿死，十天没有农民就得饿死。”有人问十天之内你煮饭没有火柴怎么办，王根保代答说：“我可以拿火芒子引火。”大家哄堂大笑说：“大家都没火你到那里去呢？火芒子也是工人生产出来的。”一队队长张立国站起来说：“棉布油盐都是工人生产的，你不要工人，难道你叫我们大家披树皮、吃生东西，过原始人的生活吗？”这时，只有王根保一个人坚持自己的意见说：“工农联盟是要联盟的，我就是对工人拿钱太多不服气。”于是大家又以本县县城（相距二里）的三友食品加工厂的实例算了一笔账：这个厂有二十二个工人，每个工人每年上缴利润平均高达四千八百一十八元，而每个农民每年交给国家的农业税只有二十三点二元，每个工人对国家建设的贡献等于一百多个农民的贡献。王根保就只得承认工人对国家的贡献大得多，报酬比农民稍多一些也是应该的。
    为了帮助王根保彻底解决思想问题，大家又进一步帮助他寻找思想根源。转业军人吴永生说：“王根保，你这种不问技术高低、贡献大小要一律平等的想法，是一种绝对平均主义思想。你想想如果我们大家先跟你评一评，不论劳动强弱拿一样的工分，保证你明年就不高兴养三条猪了。”三队队长杜常胜启发王根保说：“解放前你也是个贫农，吃过豆饼，没田没地，更不要说养猪了。解放以后共产党帮你分得土地，国家贷款给你发展生产，组织合作社，现在你才吃上了大米，饲养了三口猪，但是你现在忘了本，你光想到工人生活水平提高了，你就对国家对党不满，你不想想你自己的生活变了几变，提高了多少，忘记了听党的话，依靠工人阶级。”吃豆饼的事实，使王根保回忆到过去的痛苦，才真正心悦诚服了。他说：“这样说就对了，党和国家对工人好，对我们农民也没有两样。我今后一定要听党的话。”经过这场辩论，王根保的阶级觉悟大大提高，现在他成了全社大辩论中的积极分子，每次辩论会他都用实际事例去说服别的社员。经过这场辩论，全体社员也都树立了依靠工人阶级领导、依靠工农联盟来建设社会主义的思想。
