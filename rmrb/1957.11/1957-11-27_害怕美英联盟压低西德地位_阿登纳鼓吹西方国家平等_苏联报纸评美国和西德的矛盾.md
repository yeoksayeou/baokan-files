Xinhua News Agency, November 26th dispatch from Amsterdam: West German Chancellor Adenauer, at a European Cultural Foundation meeting held here on the 23rd, advocated that all Western nations mobilize to counter Soviet power. However, he simultaneously emphasized that Western nations should adopt a "common policy based on equality of responsibility and equality of burden," and that Western Europe "should not hand over the main burden of common defense to the United States."

The news revealed that while Adenauer cheered the US decision to intensify the nuclear arms race, he expressed concern that the US-UK atomic hegemony plans coming from Washington and London would relegate West Germany to a second-class nation. Although the West German government is willing to possess nuclear weapons, it has so far been unable to manufacture them.

Adenauer demanded "trust" guarantees from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. He demanded that the United States consult within the group and reach consensus beforehand when adopting major policies involving the mutual relations of the countries in this group. West German Foreign Minister Brentano's recent activities in the United States stemmed from this demand, but this demand has been rejected by the United States.

It is reported that West Germany's demands in this regard are consistent with France's position and have received support from Italy. Following his meeting with Dulles in Washington, Brentano rushed to Rome on the 25th to meet with the Italian government. In Rome, Brentano told reporters that talking about establishing a British-American alliance in opposition to other NATO countries is as impossible as talking about establishing a Franco-German alliance.

Xinhua News Agency, November 26th dispatch from Moscow via TASS on November 26th: The Soviet newspaper "Izvestia," commenting on the talks between West German Foreign Minister Brentano and US Secretary of State Dulles, said: Brentano's attempt to break away from "American monopoly" within NATO has failed. Brentano received a cold reception in Washington. The West German ruling group, which had high hopes for this US-West German meeting, was very disappointed.

The "Labor Daily," commenting on the meeting, said: The main purpose of Brentano's trip was to enhance West Germany's position within NATO and to give West Germany the right to participate in deciding how and where to use atomic weapons. Brentano's mission failed. Washington viewed Bonn's plans as directly undermining the US monopoly position within NATO.

    害怕美英联盟压低西德地位
    阿登纳鼓吹西方国家平等
    苏联报纸评美国和西德的矛盾
    据新华社26日讯　阿姆斯特丹消息：西德总理阿登纳23日在这里举行的欧洲文化基金组织会议上鼓吹西方国家全部动员起来同苏联力量相抗衡，不过他同时强调，西方国家应该采取一种“在责任平等和负担平等的基础上的共同政策”，西欧“不应当把共同防御的主要负担交给美国”。
    消息透露，阿登纳在欢呼美国关于加紧核武器竞赛的决定的同时，表现出一种隐忧，担心从华盛顿和伦敦方面传出来的美—英原子霸权的计划将把西德排斥在次等国家的地位。西德政府虽然愿意拥有核武器，但迄今它还不能制造这种武器。
    阿登纳要求北大西洋集团的“信任”保证。他要求美国在采取关涉到这个集团国家的相互关系的重大政策时，能够事先在这个集团内进行协商，并取得一致意见。西德外交部长勃伦塔诺最近在美国的活动就是出于这种要求，但这个要求已经为美国所拒绝。
    据报道：西德在这方面的要求是同法国的主张一致的，并且受到意大利的支持。勃伦塔诺在华盛顿同杜勒斯会谈结束后25日又赶到罗马同意大利政府会谈。勃伦塔诺在罗马对新闻记者谈话说：谈论建立一个同其他北大西洋公约组织国家对立的英美联盟跟谈论建立法德联盟一样是不可能的事。
    据新华社26日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科26日讯：苏联“消息报”在评论西德外交部长勃伦塔诺同美国国务卿杜勒斯的会谈时说：勃伦塔诺要摆脱北大西洋集团里“美国的垄断”的尝试失败了。勃伦塔诺在华盛顿受到冷待。对这次美国西德两国会谈抱着很大希望的西德统治集团，感到很失望。
    “劳动报”在评论这次会谈时说：勃伦塔诺此行的主要目的是要增强西德在北大西洋集团里的地位，并且使西德有权参与决定采取什么方式和在什么地方使用原子武器。勃伦塔诺的使命失败了。波恩的计划被华盛顿方面认为是直接损害美国在北大西洋集团里的垄断地位的计划。
