Peace Manifesto
Workers and Peasants! Workers in science, technology, and culture! All people of goodwill in all countries of the world!

We, the representatives of the Communist and Workers' Parties of various nations who have come to Moscow to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution, appeal to you, to your conscience, to your hearts.

We all still remember the tragic scenes and disasters of the Second World War. The bloodstains of this war have not yet been completely washed away, and the terrifying shadow of a new war, a hundred times more destructive, is already looming over peaceful cities and villages. Today, there is no country in the world where the threat of a new war does not constantly overshadow the homes of its people, dimming their enjoyment of life and posing the following unsettling question:

What will happen tomorrow, in a month, in a year? Will our homes be burned again in the flames of war, will atomic and hydrogen bombs with their all-destroying power bring sudden death to us and our children?

The people of all countries have gained painful experience in two world wars. The ordinary people who suffered the most severe sacrifices in the storms of war know that future wars will bring ever greater disasters, destroy more countries, kill more people, and create more terrible long-term consequences.

The First World War, provoked by the imperialist powers and launched by German militarism, took the lives of ten million people and left tens of millions more without health, turning them into cripples. The war forced the people of many countries into starvation and poverty.

The main instigator of the Second World War was German fascism. Not only a large number of troops and various fronts were drawn into the whirlpool of war at that time. Aerial bombardments destroyed undefended cities, killing millions of peaceful residents, while millions of men, women, and children were sacrificed in Hitler's concentration camps and gas chambers. A large amount of material wealth, which could have been used to build thousands of prosperous cities and ensure that many people were fed and clothed, was used for destruction and the creation of death. The Second World War swallowed more than thirty million human lives, not including the tens of millions who were injured and crippled. In its final days, the first two atomic bombs fell on undefended cities in Japan – a real threat of future large-scale human slaughter.

Neither the knowledge of scientists nor the imagination of poets is needed to determine that the next war – if the people of all countries fail to stop its outbreak – will exceed all the disasters that mankind has experienced to date. Residents of Europe, America, Asia, Africa, and Australia all know that mankind has liberated such enormous natural forces and mastered such powerful means that their destructive effects can reach any place on earth. In the new war, there will be no place where people can find safe refuge. The flames of atomic bombs, hydrogen bombs, and rocket warfare will burn the people of all countries and threaten today's mankind and its descendants with countless disasters.

Ordinary people all over the world, regardless of nationality, political views, religious beliefs, or skin color, want to live in peace. Ordinary people all over the world want to ask:

Man is exploring all the secrets of nature with his invincible wisdom and is increasingly enhancing his control over it. The launch of the Soviet artificial earth satellite, which will soon make it possible for man to reach the stars, can man not avoid war and prevent self-destruction?

We, the representatives of the Communist and Workers' Parties, fully aware of our responsibility for the fate of the people of all countries, declare:

War is not inevitable, war can be prevented, and peace can be defended and consolidated.

We are gathered in the capital of the country that opened a new era in human history forty years ago. In 1917, in the land of Russia, the socialist revolution achieved victory for the first time in history. The working people seized power and set before themselves a goal: to eliminate all forms of human oppression and exploitation. The workers and peasants of Russia, under the leadership of Lenin's party, wrote the slogan of peace on their banner and have always been faithful to it. For forty years, the Soviet state has paved the way for peace for the people of all countries, and despite the numerous obstacles created by the imperialists, has striven for peaceful cooperation with other countries, regardless of their social system.

The workers in capitalist countries have actively participated in this struggle to defend peace for their own vital interests. This noble cause has been supported by all progressive people in the world. But the forces of peace were not able to save mankind from a new catastrophe, to avoid the Second World War. At that time, this force was too weak, and the Soviet Union was the only country that consistently fought for the maintenance of peace.

Today, we Communists say that war can now be prevented and peace can be maintained. We say this with full confidence because the situation in the world has changed and the balance of power has changed.

The Soviet state, born in the Great October Revolution, is no longer a lonely and helpless country. After the victory over fascism, a huge socialist world with nearly one billion people has taken shape. Another great socialist power – People's China – is marching forward alongside the Soviet Union for peace and international cooperation, and for achieving peaceful coexistence of different social systems. The People's Democratic countries of Europe and Asia are also struggling for the same peaceful goals.

The unprecedented development of industry, science, and technology in the Soviet Union and other socialist countries is conducive to the cause of peace and is a powerful obstacle to launching war.

Another new force has also emerged on the world stage, namely the colonial people awakened by the October Revolution, some of whom have already broken free from the shackles of long-term subordination, and some of whom are in the process of breaking free from these shackles; they want to live in peace and do not allow imperialist forces to interfere in their internal affairs. In order to eliminate backwardness and poverty, they pursue a policy of peace and neutrality, a policy of the well-known "Five Principles" – mutual respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty, mutual non-aggression, mutual non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence.

Not only the people of socialist countries, not only the people of Eastern countries do not want war; the people of Western capitalist countries who have experienced two wars also hate war.

The forces of peace are enormous, and this force can stop war and maintain peace. But we Communists believe that we have a responsibility to remind all the people of the world: the danger of a terrible, murderous war has not passed.

Where does the threat to the cause of peace and the threat to the security of the people of all countries come from? Those who are keen on war and fantasize about war are the monopoly capitalist groups who have made huge fortunes in the two world wars and in the current arms race. The arms race has brought huge profits to the monopoly capitalists, while placing an increasingly heavy burden on the shoulders of the working people, seriously deteriorating the economic situation in many countries. The ruling groups of some capitalist countries, under the pressure of monopoly capital, especially American monopoly capital, refuse proposals on disarmament, the prohibition of nuclear weapons, and other measures to prevent a new war. Peace-loving countries have put forward many good proposals to the United Nations, and adopting these proposals would consolidate peace and reduce the threat of a new war. No one can deny that the proposals submitted to the United Nations for discussion on stopping the arms race and eliminating the threat of atomic war, on peaceful coexistence among countries, and on developing economic cooperation among countries – the decisive factor in establishing the necessary trust in international relations – are in the vital interests of the people of all countries. The fate of the world, the future of mankind, depends to a large extent on the resolution of these issues. Only those who are keen on maintaining international tensions are vehemently opposed to these proposals.

Tens of thousands of newspapers and radio stations repeatedly tell the people of the United States, Britain, France, Italy, and other capitalist countries every day that "world communism" threatens their freedom, their way of life, and their peaceful existence.

However, neither any Communist Party nor any socialist country has any motive for launching a war and launching a military attack on other countries, nor any motive for plundering other countries' land. The Soviet Union and People's China themselves possess vast lands and countless natural resources. In all socialist countries, there are no classes or social strata that are keen on war. Here, the workers and peasants are in power, and they have suffered the most sacrifices in all past wars. Would they want a new war? The aim of the Communists is to build a society that can guarantee the welfare of all the people, the prosperity of all ethnic groups, and lasting peace among all nations. Socialist countries need lasting peace to build this society. Therefore, there is no one more consistently opposed to war and more firmly in favor of peace than the Communists!

Socialist countries do not want to impose their social and political system on any nation by force. They firmly believe that socialism will inevitably triumph, but they also know that socialism cannot be transplanted from the outside; it should first be the result of the domestic struggle of the working class and all progressive forces in each country. Therefore, socialist countries have no intention of interfering in the internal affairs of other countries, but they will not allow other countries to interfere in their internal affairs either. Therefore, the argument that socialist countries seem to want to impose their system on others by force and threaten peace is nothing more than an attempt to deceive peace-loving people.

Only if all those who cherish peace work together, increase their vigilance against the schemes of war instigators, and fully understand that it is their sacred duty to work harder to defend the peace that is still under threat can peace be maintained.

For the sake of the happiness of the masses of people all over the world, for the sake of the progress and bright future of the people of all countries, we

To men and women,
To workers and peasants,
To workers in science and the arts,
To teachers and clerks,
To young people,
To craftsmen, merchants, and industrialists,
To socialists, democrats, and liberals,
To all people regardless of their political views and religious beliefs,
To all who love their motherland,
To all who do not want war,
To all people of goodwill in the world,
We appeal to you all:

Arise to demand an end to the arms race, because the arms race intensifies the danger of war and has the greatest impact on you – the working people;
Arise to demand a ban on the production and use of atomic and hydrogen weapons, and the first step is to immediately stop testing these weapons;
Arise to demand an end to the policy of piecing together military blocs and establishing military bases in other countries;
Arise to demand that German militarists, the culprits of the last war, not be rearmed in the heart of Europe;
Arise to demand a halt to the imperialists' conspiracies and war provocations in the Middle East;
Arise to support the policy of collective security, the policy of peaceful coexistence among different social systems, and the policy of broad economic and cultural cooperation among the people of all countries.

We appeal to you all:

Arise to demand that your government pursue a policy of peace in the United Nations and oppose the policy of the Cold War.

We appeal to all people of goodwill in the world:

Organize and fight for:
(1) An immediate end to the testing of atomic and hydrogen weapons;
(2) An unconditional ban on the production and use of these weapons within the shortest possible time.

We Communists are dedicated to the cause of socialism. We Communists unswervingly believe in the victory of this great cause. It is precisely because we believe in the victory of our ideas – the ideas of Marx and Lenin, the ideas of proletarian internationalism – that we desire peace and fight for peace. War is our enemy.

Let countries with different social systems compete with each other in the future in the development of peaceful science and peaceful technology. Let them prove their superiority not on the battlefield, but in the competition for progress and for raising the living standards of the people.

We extend our hand to all people of goodwill. We want to use our common strength to get rid of the burden of armaments on the shoulders of the people. We want to save the world from the threat of war, death, and destruction. Ahead of us is the bright and happy future of mankind marching towards progress.

Give the world peace!

This declaration was adopted by the delegations of the Communist Parties and Workers' Parties of the following countries: Australia, Austria, Albania, Algeria, Argentina, Belgium

### 和平宣言

1957-11-23

专栏：

    和平宣言工人和农民们！科学、技术和文化工作者们！世界各国一切善良的人们！
    我们，这次来到莫斯科庆祝伟大十月社会主义革命四十周年的各国共产党和工人党的代表，向你们，向你们的良知，向你们的心灵呼吁。
    第二次世界大战的惨象和灾难，我们大家都还记忆犹新。这次战争的血迹还未完全洗净，而破坏性增加百倍的新战争的可怕阴影又在笼罩着平静的城市和乡村。今天，世界上没有任何一个国家，新战争的威胁不在常常笼罩着那里的人们的家园，不使他们的生活乐趣变得阴暗，不向他们提出以下的充满不安的问题：
    明天，过一个月，过一年，究竟会怎样呢？我们的家是否又要在战争的火焰中烧毁，具有毁灭一切的威力的原子弹和氢弹是否要给我们和我们的孩子们带来突然的死亡？
    各国人民在两次世界大战中已经取得了沉痛的经验。在战争风暴中遭受最惨重牺牲的普通的人们都知道，今后发生的战争就会一次比一次带来更沉重的灾难，毁坏更多的国家，杀害更多的人，造成更可怕的长远后果。
    由帝国主义列强所引起而为德国军国主义所发动的第一次世界大战，夺去了一千万人的生命，使几千万人失去了健康，变成了残废。战争迫使许多国家的人民陷于饥饿和贫困的境地。
    第二次世界大战的主要发动者是德国的法西斯，当时卷入战争漩涡的不仅仅是大量的军队和各个战线。飞机轰炸破坏了不设防的城市，杀害了千千万万的和平居民，而在希特勒集中营里和毒气室里则有数百万的男人、妇女和儿童惨遭牺牲。大量的物资财富本来可以用来建造成千座繁荣的城市，可以保证众多的人民吃饱穿暖，但是这些财富却被用于毁灭和制造死亡。第二次世界大战共吞没了三千万以上的人的生命，这还不包括千千万万受伤的和变成残废的人在内，在它的最后几天，在日本不设防的城市落下了头两颗原子弹——这种未来的大规模屠杀人类的实际威胁。
    既不需要科学家的知识，也不需要诗人的幻想，就能断定，下一次战争——如果各国人民未能制止它爆发——将会超过人类至今所经受过的一切灾难。欧、美、亚、非、澳各洲的居民都知道，人类解放出了这样巨大的自然力量，并掌握了这样强大的手段，以致能够使其破坏作用达到地球上的任何地方。在新的战争中不会有人们能够平安避难的地方。原子弹、氢弹和火箭战争的烈火将会烧到世界各国人民，将以无数的灾难威胁今天的人类和它的后代。
    全世界的普通人们，不分民族和政治观点、宗教信仰和皮肤颜色，都希望和平地生活。全世界的普通人们要问：
    人正用自己的无往不胜的智慧探索自然的一切秘密，并且愈益增强对它的控制，而苏联人造地球卫星的发射，不久即将使人可能达到星球，难道人就不能避免战争和防止自我消灭吗？
    我们，共产党和工人党的代表，充分意识到自己对于各国人民命运的责任，我们宣称：
    战争不是不可避免的，战争是可以防止的，和平是可以保卫住和巩固起来的。
    我们聚会在四十年前开辟了人类历史新纪元的国家的首都。1917年在俄国的土地上，社会主义革命在历史上破天荒第一次获得了胜利。劳动人民掌握了政权，并且在自己面前提出了一个目的，就是要消灭一切形式的人对人的压迫和剥削。俄国的工人和农民在列宁的党的领导下在自己的旗帜上写上了和平的口号，并始终忠实于它。四十年来苏维埃国家为各国人民铺设通向和平的道路，并且不顾帝国主义者制造的重重障碍，力求同其他国家和平合作，不问它们的社会制度如何。
    资本主义国家的工人们为了自己的切身利益积极参加了这一保卫和平的斗争。这一崇高事业得到了全世界一切进步人们的支持。但是和平力量没有能够使人类免受新的浩劫，避免第二次世界大战。那时这种力量太微弱了，而苏联当时又是唯一的始终不渝为维护和平而斗争的国家。
    今天我们共产党人说，现在战争可以防止，和平可以维护住。我们是满怀信心地这样说的，因为现在世界上的情况改变了，力量的对比改变了。
    在伟大十月革命中诞生的苏维埃国家已经不是一个孤独无援的国家了。在战胜法西斯以后形成了一个拥有近十亿人口的巨大的社会主义世界。另一个伟大的社会主义强国——人民中国——为了和平和国际合作，为了达到不同社会体系的和平共处，在同苏联并肩前进。欧洲和亚洲的各人民民主国家也在为达到同样的和平目的而斗争。
    苏联和其他社会主义国家工业、科学和技术的空前发展有利于和平事业，是对发动战争的有力障碍。
    在世界舞台上还出现了另一种新的力量，这就是被十月革命所唤醒的殖民地人民，他们有的已经摆脱了长期以来的从属地位的束缚，有的正在摆脱这种束缚；他们要和平地生活，不允许帝国主义势力干涉他们的内政。为了消灭落后和贫困，他们奉行和平与中立的政策，奉行众所周知的“五项原则”——互相尊重领土主权完整、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互利、和平共处——的政策。
    不仅社会主义各国的人民，不仅东方各国的人民不希望战争；经历过两次战争的西方资本主义国家的人民也憎恶战争。
    和平力量是巨大的，这种力量能够阻止战争，维护和平。但是我们共产党人认为自己有责任提醒全世界的一切人们：可怕的、杀人的战争的危险并没有过去。
    对和平事业的威胁，对各国人民安全的威胁是来自何处呢？热中于战争的和幻想战争的是在两次世界大战中、在目前的军备竞赛中大发横财的垄断资本集团。军备竞赛给垄断资本家带来了巨额利润，而把越来越沉重的负担压在劳动人民的肩上，使许多国家的经济状况严重恶化起来。一些资本主义国家的统治集团在垄断资本、尤其是美国垄断资本的压力下拒绝关于裁军、禁止核武器及其他防止新战争的措施等建议。爱好和平的国家向联合国提出了不少很好的建议，采纳这些建议就会使和平巩固，使新战争的威胁减少。谁都不能否认，提交联合国讨论的关于停止军备竞赛和消除原子战争威胁、关于各国和平共处、关于发展各国间的经济合作——建立各国关系中的必要信任的决定性因素——等问题的建议，是符合各国人民的切身利益的。世界的命运，未来人类的命运，在很大程度上取决于这些问题的解决。只有那些热中于保持国际紧张局势的人们才极力反对这些建议。
    成千上万的报纸和电台每天向美国、英国、法国、意大利及其他资本主义国家的人民，反复地硬说什么“世界共产主义”威胁他们的自由、他们的生活方式、他们的和平生存。
    然而，无论哪一个共产党或是哪一个社会主义国家，都没有发动战争和对别国进行军事攻击的动机，都没有掠夺别国土地的动机。苏联、人民中国自己就拥有辽阔的土地和无数的自然财富。在所有社会主义国家都没有热中于战争的阶级或社会阶层。这里执政的是工人和农民，他们在过去所有战争中都受牺牲最大。难道他们会希望新战争吗？共产党人的目的是要建成能保证全体人民的福利、各族人民的繁荣、各民族间永久和平的社会。社会主义国家需要持久的和平来建设这种社会。所以，没有比共产党人更一贯反对战争、更坚决拥护和平的人了！
    社会主义各国并不想用暴力把自己的社会和政治制度强加于任何一国人民。它们坚信，社会主义必然胜利，但是它们也知道，社会主义不能从外边移植，它应该首先是每个国家的工人阶级和一切进步力量进行国内斗争的结果。所以社会主义各国完全不想干涉别国的内政，但是它们也不允许别国干涉它们的内政。因此，硬说社会主义国家似乎想用暴力把自己的制度强加于别人而威胁和平的论断，无非是企图欺骗爱好和平的人们。
    只有一切珍视和平的人们一致努力，提高对战争挑拨者的阴谋的警惕，并彻底了解到要更加努力保卫还处在威胁之下的和平是自己的神圣职责，和平才能够保持住。
    为了全世界人民群众的幸福，为了各国人民的进步和光明的未来，我们
    向男人和妇女们，
    向工人和农民们，
    向科学和艺术工作者，
    向教师和职员，
    向青年们，
    向手工业者、商人和工业家，
    向社会党人、民主党人和自由党人，
    向所有不管抱着什么政治观点和宗教信仰的人们，
    向所有热爱自己祖国的人们，
    向所有不希望战争的人们，
    向全世界一切善良的人们，
    向你们大家呼吁：
    起来要求停止军备竞赛，因为军备竞赛使战争的危险日益加剧，并且对你们——劳动的人——的影响最大；
    起来要求禁止生产和使用原子武器和氢武器，而其第一步是立即停止试验这种武器；
    起来要求停止进行拼凑军事集团和在其他国家建立军事基地的政策；
    起来要求，不要在欧洲的心脏重新武装德国军国主义者，上次战争的祸首；
    起来要求制止帝国主义者在中近东的阴谋和战争挑衅；
    起来支持集体安全政策、不同社会制度和平共处的政策、各国人民进行广泛的经济和文化合作的政策。
    我们向你们大家呼吁：
    起来要求本国政府在联合国里执行和平政策、反对冷战政策。
    我们向全世界的一切善良的人们呼吁：
    组织起来，进行斗争，争取：
      （1）立即停止试验原子武器和氢武器；
      （2）在最短期间内无条件禁止生产和使用这种武器。
    我们共产党人献身于社会主义的事业。我们共产党人始终不渝地相信这一伟大事业的胜利。正是因为我们相信我们的思想——马克思和列宁的思想、无产阶级国际主义的思想——的胜利，所以我们才希望和平，并为和平而斗争。战争就是我们的敌人。
    让社会制度不同的国家今后在发展和平科学、和平技术方面彼此展开竞赛吧。让它们不是在战场上，而是在争取进步、争取提高人民生活水平的竞赛中来证实自己的优越吧。
    我们向一切善良的人们伸出手来。我们要用共同的力量来摆脱压在人民肩上的军备负担。我们要使世界免受战争、死亡和毁灭的威胁。我们的前面是走向进步的人类底光明和幸福的未来。
    给世界以和平！
