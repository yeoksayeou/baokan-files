Xinhua News Agency, London, November 29th: The news that American planes carrying hydrogen bombs frequently take off from British airfields and fly over Britain has caused alarm and indignation among the British public. London's "Daily Worker" and "Daily Herald" reported this news with the headlines "Hydrogen Bombs Over Our Heads" and "Hydrogen Bombs Over Britain," respectively.

The British Peace Committee issued a statement on the 28th, calling for the broadest possible protests to the government against the stationing of aircraft armed with nuclear weapons in Britain, stating that such aircraft "seriously endanger the security, even the existence, of our country."

The British Peace Committee also called on people to protest against the proposal to store nuclear rockets in European countries, which will be discussed at the NATO meeting in December.

Some constituency Labour Party organizations have also strongly raised similar protests. The Paisley constituency Labour Party organization on the 28th demanded that the government no longer allow American aircraft carrying nuclear bombs to use bases in Britain. In the industrial center of Coventry, the local Labour Party organization also demanded that the government immediately stop American hydrogen bomb bombers from flying in Britain. In a resolution, they demanded that the British government "immediately request the United States government to stop this practice of placing the lives of the British people at risk from irresponsible actions."

Newspapers reported the words of British residents living near American bases. Allison Walter, who lives near Lakenheath base, said, "Why should our children live in such extreme danger?" She also said, "Someone seems to be ruthlessly disregarding our interests." Charles Wiggins, who lives near the U.S. Air Force base at Mildenhall, said, "People around here are often very nervous about the presence of American aircraft."

Under public pressure, Prime Minister Macmillan and Foreign Secretary Lloyd went to great lengths to defend this arrangement during fierce debates in the House of Commons on the 27th and 28th. Macmillan, like Lloyd on the 28th, tried to say that hydrogen bombs would not explode if a U.S. Air Force bomber crashed. They also assured that a joint Anglo-American decision would be required before hydrogen bombs could be used. However, their statements are clearly inconsistent with Dulles' statement, which has emphasized that no other country can veto the United States' decision to use nuclear weapons, and that such decisions will be taken by American field commanders.

Even the pro-government "Times" believes that the newly revealed facts are shocking and doubts whether this practice is necessary and safe. The "Times" said in an editorial on the 29th: "The argument that this practice has been implemented for some time without causing alarm or accidents does not in itself guarantee that there will be no accidents in the future."

### 美国飞机带氢弹在英国上空飞来飞去  英国公众纷纷提出愤怒抗议

    美国飞机带氢弹在英国上空飞来飞去
    英国公众纷纷提出愤怒抗议
    据新华社伦敦29日电　关于载有氢弹的美国飞机经常从英国飞机场上起飞并且飞在英国上空的消息已经引起了英国公众的惊惶和愤慨。伦敦“工人日报”和“每日先驱报”分别以头号标题“氢弹就在我们头上”和“氢弹就在英国上空”报道了这个消息。
    英国和平委员会28日发表声明，号召尽量广泛地向政府提出抗议，反对在英国驻扎装有原子核武器的飞机，并且说，这种飞机“严重地危害我国的安全甚至是它的存在”。
    英国和平委员会还号召人们提出抗议来表示反对即将在12月北大西洋公约组织会议上进行讨论的关于在欧洲各国贮放原子核火箭的建议。
    某些选区的工党组织也已经强烈地提出了相似的抗议。培斯利选区的工党组织28日要求政府不再允许载有原子核炸弹的美国飞机使用设在英国的基地。在工业中心考文垂，当地的工党组织也提出要求，主张政府立即制止美国氢弹轰炸机在英国飞行。他们在一项决议中要求英国政府“立即请求美国政府停止这种使英国人民的生命随时可能丧于不负责任的行动之下的作法”。
    报纸报道了住在美国基地附近的英国居民的谈话。住在赖垦亥斯基地附近的艾利逊·瓦尔特太太说，“我们的孩子们为什么应当生活在这种极度的危险中呢？”她还说，“有人看来是无情地不管我们的利益。”住在不利兹·诺可敦美国空军基地附近的查尔斯·威金斯说，“这里一带的人对驻扎美国飞机一事经常感到非常紧张。”
    在公众压力下，麦克米伦首相和劳埃德外交大臣在下院27日和28日两天激烈辩论期间都竭力为这种安排进行辩解。麦克米伦在28日同劳埃德一样，竭力说美国空军轰炸机坠毁时氢弹不会爆炸。他们又保证必须先由英美作出联合决定才能使用氢弹。但是，他们的声明显然跟杜勒斯的声明不一致，杜勒斯已经强调指出，任何其他国家都不能否决美国作出的使用核武器的决定，而且这种决定将由美国战地司令官来采取。
    甚至亲政府的“泰晤士报”也认为新近揭露的事实令人震惊，并且怀疑这种做法是否必要和安全可靠。“泰晤士报”29日发表社论说：“所谓这种做法已经实施了一个时候而毫未引起惊惶和毫未发生事故的论点本身并不能保证今后不出事故”。
