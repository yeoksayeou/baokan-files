Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 2nd: The "Road to Happiness" Agricultural Cooperative, led by national model worker Han En in Jiaohe County, Jilin Province, has surpassed the production level of rich peasants, and the average income of its members has exceeded that of rich peasants by one time.

The trial calculation results of this cooperative this year: the total grain output was 3,150,000 jin, with an average yield of 3,526 jin per hectare, 826 jin higher than the unit area yield of 2,700 jin of local rich peasants before joining the cooperative. This year, each member owns 1,396 jin of grain, an increase of 39.6% compared to 1956.

This year, the total output value of the collective agricultural and sideline production of this cooperative increased by 18.5% compared to last year. After deducting agricultural tax, public accumulation, and various expenses, the income per person (including household sideline occupations) was 121.4 yuan. Before joining the cooperative, the income per person for rich peasants was only 60 yuan. Agricultural cooperation has also increased the income of rich peasants who have already joined the cooperative. According to a survey of three rich peasant households that have joined the cooperative, the average income per person this year is 107 yuan, which is higher than their income before joining the cooperative.

The "Road to Happiness" Cooperative was established in 1952. Since its establishment, it has consistently adhered to the policy of expanding reproduction year by year. In the past two years, the total investment in capital construction has reached 46,000 yuan, and the total number of labor days spent on capital construction has reached 31,000.

Since its establishment, this cooperative has accumulated a total of 86,000 yuan in public accumulation. It is currently conducting education on running the cooperative diligently and thriftily, and plans to accumulate another 31,000 yuan this year. Next year, it plans to build a granular fertilizer factory to increase the amount of fertilizer applied by utilizing locally produced peat, and to develop another 30 hectares of paddy fields.

    幸福之路社坚持逐年扩大再生产的方针
    社员收入超过富裕中农一倍
    新华社长春2日电　吉林省蛟河县全国劳动模范韩恩领导的幸福之路农业社，生产水平已超过富裕中农，社员平均收入超过富裕中农一倍。
    这个社今年试算结果：粮食总产量为三百一十五万斤，平均每公顷产量三千五百二十六斤，比入社前当地富裕中农的单位面积产量二千七百斤高出八百二十六斤。今年每个社员拥有一千三百九十六斤粮食，比1956年增长39．6％。
    今年这个社集体农副业总产值比去年增长18．5％，除去农业税、公共积累和各项开支，每人收入（包括家庭副业）一百二十一元四角。而富裕中农入社前，每人收入仅六十元。农业合作化也使已经入社的富裕中农增加了收入。据对三户已入社的富裕中农调查，今年每人平均收入一百零七元，比入社前的收入为高。
    幸福之路社是1952年建成的。办社以来，一直坚持逐年扩大再生产的方针。两年来，用于基本建设的投资共达四万六千元，用于基本建设的劳动日共达三万一千个。
    这个社建社以来共有公共积累八万六千元。目前正在进行勤俭办社教育，今年准备再积累三万一千元。明年准备修建一座颗粒肥料厂，利用当地出产的草炭增加施肥量，并且再开发水田三十公顷。
