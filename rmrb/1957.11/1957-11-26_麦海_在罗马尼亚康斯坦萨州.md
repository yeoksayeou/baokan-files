Wheat Sea
--In Constanta County, Romania Wang Qi

At a little after six o'clock on the morning of June 13th, we boarded a train bound for the city of Constanta.

It is only a little over two hundred and fifty kilometers from Bucharest to the capital of Constanta County. This county is located in the southeast of the country and is the most suitable plain in Romania for large-scale cultivation.

When the train was heading to Constanta County, the morning mist had not completely dissipated. Wheat fields stretching as far as the eye could see unfolded on both sides of the railway. The almost ripe ears of wheat shone brightly under the sunlight. As the train continued to move forward, crossing the Danube River and approaching the Black Sea, the wheat fields became more and more numerous. It felt as if there was a golden expanse everywhere, and the train was like racing across a golden ocean.

Comrade Duma Vasili, the Secretary of the Constanta County Party Committee, received us in his office at the County Party Committee. At the beginning of the conversation, this young secretary told us a gratifying news:

"Our county is striving to complete the collectivization of the last county that has not yet been cooperativized by the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution. At that time, the cooperativization plan of this county can be completed one year ahead of schedule."

Last year, Romania experienced a major drought. Although the Danube River flows through Constanta County, the drought still hit it hard. The people are waiting for a good harvest this year, but what the people are waiting for more eagerly is greater achievements in collectivization.

In the short few months of this year, Romania's agricultural collectivization has achieved decisive victories in many states, and Constanta County is one of them. Please look at a few figures: 654 collective farms and co-farming cooperatives, including more than 87,530 peasant households, occupy more than 500,000 hectares of land. This is the statistic on May 25 this year, which shows that the collectivized farmers in Constanta County account for 91% of all farmers, and the land area accounts for 85.81%. However, according to the statistics on January 1, 1956, only 44.1% of farmers joined collective farms and co-farming cooperatives, and the land area only accounted for 53.2%. And the collectivized farmers, their lives and personal experiences, are more convincing than all the numbers.

On the second day of our arrival in Constanta County, we went to the home of Nicolae Fodor, a member of the "May 8th" collective farm. As soon as we sat down, Nicolae Fodor's wife placed a plate of rose jam in front of each of us. I immediately smelled a strong rose fragrance. The chairman of the farm said while eating:

"This kind of jam is not easy to buy in the market. This is their family's special jam, specially used to entertain guests."

Nicolae Fodor's wife kept moving the plate closer to me, smiling and replying to the chairman of the farm:

"Not to mention guests from China, even if people from our farm come to my house, I want them to taste the jam I made myself!"

This is a guest room, and it seems like a study. There is a large bookshelf leaning against the wall, and the bookshelf is full of books. There are landscape paintings and photos on the wall, and the whole room is spotless.

A young and beautiful girl walked in. This is Nicolae Fodor's daughter-in-law. If someone hadn't introduced her to me, I would have thought she was a neighbor studying at a university in Bucharest. She works as an elementary school teacher in a nearby village, leaving early and returning late every day. Her husband works as a secretary at the tractor station. This family of four lives a very harmonious and happy life. Nicolae Fodor is the head of the farm's iron workshop. Three people work and earn 2,600 lei per month. The hostess can only take care of her own vegetable garden and manage the housework because of her poor health. Nicolae Fodor said:

"This large vegetable garden is enough to keep her busy, and I have to help too!"

Before liberation, Nicolae Fodor's family had nothing except the clothes they wore and the things they carried. What about now? Nicolae Fodor spread out his hands and said:

"Life now is just as you see it. I believe it will be better in the future!"

Nicolae Fodor was the first supporter to organize this farm. There are tens of thousands of farmers like Nicolae Fodor in Romania, who believe that the road to collectivization is their only way to a happy life. They love the Romanian Workers' Party. The Party is the creator of all this.

Comrade Duma Vasili told us an interesting story:

A Party worker wanted to persuade a farmer to join a collective farm. The comrade entered through the front door, and the farmer slipped away from the back door. This was repeated as many as fifty times. Of course, it wasn't just one farmer who behaved like this, and it wasn't that all farmers didn't want to join the cooperative, because the rich peasants were holding them back. The rich peasants deceived the farmers, saying that they would regret joining the collective farm now. So, the farmers dared not sign the application, fearing offending God!

In the past, the farmers of Constanta County cultivated the land in the most primitive and backward way. One person walked in front with a large door panel on their back; another person followed behind and scattered the seeds on the door panel. It didn't matter where the seeds fell, they were considered planted. How far can a person walk in a day with a large door panel on their back! A tractor can cultivate at least three and a half hectares of land a day. Therefore, after collectivization, the farmers received machines supplied by the state, and the speed of production increased very quickly, incomparably greater than in the past. As a result, a large number of farmers were attracted to the collectivization movement. However, in 1953 and 1954, the collectivization movement in Constanta County stagnated. What is the reason for this? Comrade Duma Vasili answered this question:

"We forgot: as long as we don't do political persuasion work with the farmers, the rich peasants begin their 'work'." He looked at us with sharp eyes, as if to say: Are the farmers in China different from the farmers in Romania!

We felt a sense of apology when we visited Comrade Duma Vasili. During his conversation, the telephone on his desk kept ringing, and people often came in, looked at us, and then looked at the County Party Secretary. In the end, they still went out with unsolved problems. However, Comrade Duma Vasili always said:

"If the Chinese comrades have any questions, they can raise them, and I am willing to answer them all. Especially about the issue of agricultural collectivization."

In fact, Comrade Duma Vasili has already made a very clear explanation of the reason why the development of collectivization in Constanta County is so rapid: the Party's ideological work is the soul of the collectivization movement.

Later, I went to Heifote County, the first fully collectivized county in the state. In a collective farm, I met Comrade Musso George, the county party secretary. He and the chairman of the county people's government were busy solving problems for the farm. Only at dinner time, when I asked him where he lived, did he take out a photo from his pocket. This is a photo of him with his wife and daughter. He said:

"I live here, and they live somewhere else."

Heifote County is not only the first collectivized county in Constanta County, but also the first collectivized county in the country. 67% of farmers have joined collective farms; 33% of farmers have joined cooperatives. Comrade Musso George said that the current goal is to fully collectivize. In order to further improve work efficiency and get closer to the masses, the Heifote County Party Committee reduced its organization from 46 people in the past to 27 people. The organizational structure of the various departments of organization, propaganda, trade union, youth, and women was abolished, and the leadership of the townships was directly strengthened.

I asked Comrade Musso George if the work must be more tense after the county party committee's organization was reduced. He directly answered my question:

"Party workers must work every minute. Political and ideological work cannot be stopped for a moment. We will never go for a walk on Sunday until collectivization is fully realized."

I thought of the photo he carried with him, and I wanted to ask: How often do you go home? But the words came to my lips, and then I swallowed them again. Because I already knew how he would answer me.

The roadsides from Heifote County to Constanta City are all wheat fields. We rushed back to Constanta City in the twilight. The driver comrade sped up, and our car kept moving forward. The evening breeze stirred up countless wheat waves, and an endless wheat sea surged on both sides of the road. However, the words of Comrade Musso George, the county party secretary, kept ringing in my ears: "We will never go for a walk on Sunday until collectivization is realized!"

    麦海
    ——在罗马尼亚康斯坦萨州	汪琦
    6月13日早晨六点多钟，我们坐上了一列开往康斯坦萨城的列车。
    从布加勒斯特到康斯坦萨州的首府，只有二百五十多公里。这个州处在全国的东南方，是罗马尼亚最适宜于大面积耕作的平原。
    列车开往康斯坦萨州的时候，晨雾还没有完全消散。铁道两旁伸展着看不到边的麦田，快要成熟的麦穗，在阳光照耀下闪闪发光。列车继续前进，跨过多瑙河，快临近黑海的时候，麦田越来越多，只觉得到处是金晃晃的一片，列车如同奔驰在金色的海洋上一样。
    杜马·瓦西利同志，是康斯坦萨州的州委书记，他在州委会他的办公室里接见了我们。这位年青的书记在开始谈话的时候，就告诉了我们一个可喜的消息：
    “我们这个州争取在十月革命节四十周年纪念的时候，将使最后一个没有合作化的县合作化，那时，这个州的合作化计划，就可提前一年完成。”
    去年，罗马尼亚经历了一次大旱灾，康斯坦萨州虽有多瑙河流过，但是，旱灾还是狠狠地袭击了它。人民等待着今年的好收成，但是，人民更急切地等待着的，是更大的合作化的成就。
    在今年短短的几个月里，罗马尼亚农业合作化在许多州里取得了决定性的胜利，康斯坦萨州就是其中的一个。请看几个数字吧：六百五十四个集体农庄和共耕社，包括八万七千五百三十多户农民，占有土地五十多万公顷。这是今年5月25日统计的数目字，它说明了康斯坦萨州合作化的农户占全体农民91％，土地面积占85．81％。可是，1956年1月1日的统计，只有44．1％农户加入集体农庄、共耕社，土地面积只占53．2％。而合作化了的农民，他们的生活和亲身体验，比一切的数字更富有说服力。
    我们到康斯坦萨州的第二天，就到了“5月8日”集体农庄庄员尼古劳埃·弗多的家里。我们刚坐下来，尼古劳埃·弗多的妻子就在我们面前各放了一碟玫瑰果酱。我马上闻到一股浓馥的玫瑰花香。农庄主席边吃边说：
      “这种果酱在市上也不容易买到。这是他们家特制的果酱，专门用来招待客人的。”
    尼古劳埃·弗多的妻子老把碟子往我身边挪，笑着回答农庄主席：
    “不要说是中国来的客人，就是我们农庄的人到我家来了，我也要他尝尝我亲手做的果酱的！”
    这是一间客室，又好像是书房。有一个很大的书架靠墙摆着，书架上放满了书。墙上有风景画和照片，整个屋子收拾得一尘不染。
    有一个年青漂亮的女孩子走进来了，这就是尼古劳埃·弗多的儿媳妇。如果不是别人为我介绍，我还以为她是一个在布加勒斯特上大学的邻居呢。她在附近村子里当小学教员，每天早出晚归。她的丈夫在拖拉机站当秘书。这一家四口人，生活过得非常和谐而幸福。尼古劳埃·弗多是农庄铁工场的负责人。三个人工作，一月收入两千六百列依。女主人因为身体不好，只能照料自己的菜园和管理家务。尼古劳埃·弗多说：
      “这一片大菜园子够她忙的了，还要我帮着呢！”
    尼古劳埃·弗多一家，在解放以前，除了身上穿的，手里提的，什么也没有，现在呢？尼古劳埃·弗多摊开双手，这样说：
      “现在的生活，正如你们所看到的。我相信将来会更好！”
    尼古劳埃·弗多是组织这个农庄的第一个支持者。罗马尼亚有成千成万像尼古劳埃·弗多这样的农民，他们认为合作化的道路，就是他们唯一的走向幸福生活的道路。他们热爱罗马尼亚工人党。党是这一切的缔造者。
    杜马·瓦西利同志告诉了我们一个有趣的故事：
    有一个党的工作者，要说服农民加入集体农庄，这个同志从前门进，农民从后门溜走。如此反复达五十次之多。当然不只是一个农民有这种表现，也不是农民都不想加入合作社，因为富农在那里拉后腿。富农欺骗农民说，现在加入集体农庄，将来会后悔的。于是，农民不敢在申请书上签字，怕得罪上帝！
    康斯坦萨州的农民，过去耕种土地的方法，是最原始、最落后的。一个人背一块大门板在前面走；另一个人跟在后面，把种子撒在门板上，种子不管落在那里，就算种上了。一个人背着一块大门板，一天能走多远呢！一部拖拉机，一天至少可以种三公顷半的土地，所以，在合作化以后，农民得到了国家供给的机器，生产提高的速度很快，比过去大得不可比拟，因而大批农民被吸引到合作化运动中来。可是，在1953年和1954年，康斯坦萨州的合作化运动，却有停滞的现象。这是什么缘故呢？杜马·瓦西利同志回答了这个问题：
      “我们忘记了：只要我们什么时候不向农民做政治说服工作，富农就开始了他们的‘工作’”。他用锋利的眼光看着我们，似乎是说：中国的农民同罗马尼亚的农民难道不一样吗！
    我们访问杜马·瓦西利同志的时候，一直有一种抱歉的心情，在他谈话中间，他的办公桌上的电话铃老是响着，常常有人走进来，看看我们，又看看州委书记，结果，还是带着没有解决的问题走出去了。可是，杜马·瓦西利同志总是这样说：
    “中国的同志有什么问题，都可以提出来，我都愿意答复。尤其是关于农业合作化的问题。”
    其实杜马·瓦西利同志关于康斯坦萨州合作化发展特别快的原因，已经作了很明确的解释：党的思想工作，是合作化运动的灵魂。
    后来，我又到州里第一个全部合作化的县——黑伏特县访问。在一个集体农庄里，遇到了县委书记默索·乔治同志，他正和县人民政府主席一起，忙着给农庄解决问题。只有在吃饭的时候，我问他住在那里，他才从口袋里拿出一张照片来。这是他和妻子、女儿合照的相片，他说：
      “我就住在这里，她们住在别的地方。”
    黑伏特县不仅是康斯坦萨州第一个合作化的县，也是全国第一个合作化的县。67％的农户加入了集体农庄；33％的农户加入了合作社。默索·乔治同志说，现在的目标，就是要全部集体化。为了更加发挥工作效率，更加接近群众，黑伏特县委缩减了机构，由过去的四十六人，减少到二十七人。取消了组织、宣传、工会、青年、妇女各个部门的组织，直接加强乡的领导。
    我问默索·乔治同志，县委机构缩减了以后，工作一定更紧张了吧。他直截了当地答复了我的问题：
    “党的工作者每分钟都要做工作。政治思想工作，一刻也不能停留。要不彻底实现集体化，我们决不在星期天去散步。”
    我想起他身边带着的那张照片，我想问：你多少时候回家一趟呢？可是，话到了我的嘴边，又吞下去了。因为我已经知道他会怎样回答我的。
    从黑伏特县到康斯坦萨城的公路两边，都是麦田。我们在暮色苍茫中赶回康斯坦萨城。司机同志加快了速度，我们的汽车一直向前奔驰。晚风吹起了无数的麦浪，公路两旁顿时涌起了无边的麦海。可是，我的耳边一直响着县委书记默索·乔治同志的话：“不实现集体化，决不在星期天去散步！”
