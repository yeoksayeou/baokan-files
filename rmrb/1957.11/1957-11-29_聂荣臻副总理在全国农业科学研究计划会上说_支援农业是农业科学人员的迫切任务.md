Xinhua News Agency, 28th. Vice Premier Nie Rongzhen delivered an important report today at the meeting held at the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences to discuss the 1958 National Agricultural Science Research Plan. In addition to the scientists of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, scientists and professors from relevant institutes of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Beijing Agricultural University listened to Vice Premier Nie’s report.

Why is Current Agricultural Scientific Research Work Lagging Behind Production Needs?

Vice Premier Nie pointed out that at the beginning of last year, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China put forward the draft National Agricultural Development Program (1956-1967), which has recently been revised again, and a high tide of agricultural mass production movement has now been set off across the country. He said: Agricultural scientific research work plays a significant role in the development of agricultural production. China's agricultural cooperativization has been basically completed. Cooperative agricultural production urgently needs the support of science and technology, and at the same time, it provides broad possibilities for the promotion and application of science and technology in agricultural production. To support agricultural production with research results is the glorious and urgent task of agricultural scientific and technical personnel. Over the past eight years, China's agricultural production has made remarkable achievements. There is no basis for conservative ideas about agricultural production increase, disbelief in the superiority of cooperativization, disbelief in the creativity of the working masses, and disbelief that science and technology, once mastered by the peasant masses, will generate tremendous material strength. Over the past eight years, China's agricultural scientific research work has made achievements. In selecting and breeding improved crop varieties, preventing and controlling diseases and insect pests, improving cultivation methods, improving soil fertilizers, carrying out soil and water conservation, water conservancy irrigation, breeding improved livestock breeds, preventing and controlling livestock epidemics, developing special crops, and trial-manufacturing improved farm implements, some achievements have been made more or less; of course, these achievements are still far from enough compared with the needs of agricultural production. In the draft agricultural development program, there are about twenty articles that directly require the cooperation of agricultural scientific and technological research work, and almost all agricultural scientific departments are involved. Compared with the current situation of agricultural scientific research work and the situation of great development of agricultural production, it is far behind. In order to change this backward situation, it is necessary to first solve the ideological problems of agricultural scientific research.

Vice Premier Nie said that we have always advocated that scientific research work must combine theory with practice, and must closely integrate improving scientific level with serving production and construction. Agricultural scientific research work must be based on the characteristics of China's agriculture, summarize the rich experience of Chinese farmers, absorb the advanced achievements of world science, conduct creative research, serve agricultural production increase, and constantly improve the level of agricultural science. In this regard, under the leadership of the Party, agricultural scientific workers in China have made progress in recent years. However, at present, China's agricultural scientific research work has not been fully carried out in accordance with this principle. On the contrary, the phenomenon of being out of touch with reality, out of touch with production, and out of touch with the masses is still quite serious. For example, some agricultural scientists are unwilling to leave the greenhouse, unwilling to leave the city, and even more unwilling to go to the inland and mountainous areas. Some even study tropical crops but are unwilling to go to Hainan Island, and some study animal husbandry and veterinary medicine but are unwilling to go to pastoral areas, thinking that the experience of the masses is unscientific and that going to the countryside hinders their own "progress." They lack sensitivity to the new creations in the production practice of the peasant masses. They have not or are unwilling to seriously summarize the abundant experience of many high-yield areas; they lack the courage to study the difficult problems raised in agricultural production, and few people are willing to study crop cultivation issues. Research topics often come from books and go back to books. Even in experiments, they do not observe in person, do not do it themselves, and research records only reach out to workers. Such scientific research work will not have creative contributions, and of course, it will not bring benefits to agricultural production. We should resolutely break away from this wrong way of thinking and working.

Overcome Individualism and Sectarianism, and Carry Out Scientific Research Work in an Organized, Planned and Focused Manner

Vice Premier Nie said that China has a vast territory, and its natural environment such as climate, topography, and vegetation is very complex. China has a long history of agriculture, and the production experience of the masses is very rich. Agricultural scientists must proceed from the actual conditions of different regions, go deep into the countryside, face production, strengthen investigation and research, humbly learn from the advanced experience of farmers, conduct scientific analysis and judgment, and then formulate their own research directions, choose correct research topics, and adopt correct research methods; and apply and promote research results according to different times, places, and conditions. Develop China's agricultural science in the great development of agriculture.

The problems raised in agricultural production are often intricate and complex, requiring the mutual cooperation of various disciplines to conduct comprehensive research theoretically or experimentally, requiring more scientific workers to conduct collective research, and some also require cooperative research with state-owned farms, agricultural cooperatives, or peasant masses, in order to achieve the expected results. Agricultural scientific research work has heavy tasks and a wide scope. In terms of disciplines, all disciplines are important. However, in order to make our research work closely integrated with the needs of China's current agricultural production, we must have priorities, especially in terms of organizing manpower and material resources. Agricultural production has great regional characteristics, and agricultural scientific research institutions are scattered throughout the country, which objectively easily leads to scattered and repetitive work. Therefore, it is necessary to appropriately organize the forces of various disciplines, departments, and regions to carry out coordination and cooperation to solve the most urgent and important problems. However, some scientific workers are still accustomed to working alone, unwilling to cooperate with others, emphasizing personal interests, and opposing organized, planned, and focused research work. As a result, research topics in one institute are very scattered, even one person per topic. Among the various research institutes, research topics are heavily repeated. For example, there are more than forty places across the country conducting research on rice transplanters at the same time. There are more than two thousand research topics proposed at this conference, and there are many unnecessary repetitions, lacking mutual contact and cooperation with each other. The contact and cooperation between various disciplines, various institutions, various regions, scientific research institutions, scientific research personnel and state-owned farms, cooperatives, and farmers is even rarer. This individualistic and sectarian work style is fundamentally contrary to the socialist scientific research path and must be corrected. Therefore, advocating comprehensive, collective, planned, focused, and collaborative research in agricultural scientific research work is an important key to the development of China's agricultural science. Only in this way can we give full play to the superiority of socialism, give full play to the various favorable conditions brought to agricultural science by socialist large-scale production, and also make it easier to use the rich achievements of modern science. When agricultural scientific research departments arrange their own research work and overcome the shortcomings of their work, the agricultural group of the Ministry of Agriculture and the State Council's Science Planning Committee and the relevant leading departments in various localities should give active assistance.

Establishing a Leadership Center for Agricultural Science is an Important Task

Vice Premier Nie pointed out that in order to meet the needs of China's agricultural scientific research work, it is also necessary to solve the problem of organizational leadership in agricultural scientific research work. In recent years, due to the Party and the government's emphasis on agriculture and agricultural science, the development of agricultural science has been very rapid. The growth of institutions and personnel is faster than that of other disciplines. We now have a not small agricultural scientific team - 205 agricultural scientific research institutions, 27 higher agricultural colleges, and more than 10,000 scientific and technical personnel with university degrees or above. The scale has been expanded, but it has not been well organized and led, and its combat effectiveness has not been fully demonstrated. At present, in general, there are more soldiers than generals, some places have soldiers but no generals, and some experts have not been able to play their roles well. How to better organize this team to serve agricultural production is the urgent task at present. At the beginning of this year, we established the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, and we should strengthen and support it in all aspects so that it can become the national agricultural science leadership center and key research center, and form a national agricultural science work network around this center, comprising various agricultural scientific research institutions and higher agricultural colleges. The Academy of Agricultural Sciences should, in accordance with the revised draft of the National Agricultural Development Program and the long-term plan for national science and technology development, propose the direction and tasks of national agricultural scientific research, formulate key research work plans, organize the national agricultural scientific research forces in various relevant fields, conduct coordination and cooperation, and take appropriate measures or make suggestions for the development of China's agricultural science. Although the strength of the Academy of Agricultural Sciences is not yet large enough, it must strive in this direction. With the care of the Party and the government, with the support of all relevant departments, and through the joint efforts of agricultural scientists across the country, this goal can be achieved.

Vice Premier Nie said that establishing a scientific research leadership center is not easy, but it is very necessary. Right-wingers oppose our establishment of a scientific leadership center, attempt to disperse China's scientific forces, usurp the leadership of China's scientific work, and make China's scientific cause deviate from the socialist path and move towards the capitalist path. This conspiracy of the right-wingers has been completely shattered by us.

Vice Premier Nie said that most of China's existing agricultural scientific forces are in various higher agricultural colleges. Some teachers do not teach courses for years. If their role can be fully utilized, the scientific research force will grow rapidly. The State Council has already decided to place higher agricultural colleges under the leadership of the Ministry of Agriculture, and to delegate agricultural colleges to the leadership of provinces and autonomous regions, which has created good conditions for agricultural colleges and agricultural scientific research institutions to jointly carry out scientific research work under the leadership of local Party committees and governments. It is more convenient to closely integrate production, teaching, and scientific research. In addition to the specialized research institutes affiliated to the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, which should arrange their own research work from a national perspective, the research institutes in various regions, provinces, and autonomous regions must closely cooperate with agricultural colleges, undertake the task of agricultural scientific research centers in their respective regions, implement scientific and technological guidance for experimental stations and farms in special areas and counties, and implement technical guidance for agricultural extension agencies in various places. State-owned farms and other places are bases for the promotion of agricultural science and technology, and they should also closely cooperate with agricultural scientific research institutions and provide convenience for experimental research. The research institutions related to agriculture under the Chinese Academy of Sciences and other government departments should cooperate with the Academy of Agricultural Sciences to serve the development of agricultural production.

Give Full Play to the Role of Scientists and Attach Importance to the Training of Young Technical Personnel

Vice Premier Nie said that at present, there are a total of 10,800 agricultural scientists and technicians with university degrees or above in the country, including 1,300 senior personnel (associate researchers and associate professors or above). In terms of research guidance force, it is still not enough, and some new disciplines are still lacking. It is very important to give full play to the role of senior scientists and train young scientific and technical personnel. This requires old scientists to further transform their thinking and improve their work style, go deep into reality, continuously improve their scientific level, actively train young cadres, and pass on their knowledge to the next generation. On the one hand, it requires young scientific and technical personnel to respect old scientists and humbly learn from old scientists. Unite as one, form a whole, and carry out agricultural scientific research work in an organized and led manner.

Several Issues That Should Be Paid Attention to in Agricultural Scientific Work

Finally, Vice Premier Nie put forward several things that should be paid attention to in agricultural scientific work: First, from the perspective of agricultural scientific and technological research, ensure the realization of the revised draft of the National Agricultural Development Program, implement the long-term plan for scientific and technological development, the annual plan, and the coordination plan for agricultural scientific organizations.

Second, strengthen the work of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences and the Agricultural Group of the State Council's Science Planning Committee, and conduct coordination, supervision, and inspection on a regular basis. Give full play to existing manpower and material resources, and run scientific undertakings in accordance with the principle of building the country through diligence and thrift. For the convenience of work, the Agricultural Group of the Science Planning Committee can set up several groups according to specialties, and provinces and autonomous regions should strengthen the leadership of local agricultural scientific research work.

Third, on the basis of the victory in the anti-rightist struggle, deeply carry out the rectification movement and improve work. Strengthen ideological transformation of intellectuals. Study Marxism-Leninism, learn from advanced Soviet science and technology, and combine them with China's reality. Serve agricultural production and improving the lives of farmers and all the people wholeheartedly.

Fourth, earnestly pay attention to training agricultural scientific and technical cadres among workers and peasants.

    聂荣臻副总理在全国农业科学研究计划会上说
    支援农业是农业科学人员的迫切任务
    新华社28日讯　聂荣臻副总理今天在中国农业科学院召开的讨论1958年全国农业科学研究计划会议上作了重要报告。听取聂副总理报告的，除中国农业科学院的科学家外，还有中国科学院有关研究所和北京农业大学的科学家和教授们。
    为什么当前农业科学研究工作落后于生产需要？
    聂副总理指出去年初中共中央提出了1956年到1967年全国农业发展纲要草案，最近又重新作了修正，目前在全国已经掀起农业大生产运动的高潮。他说：农业科学研究工作对发展农业生产起着重大的作用。我国的农业合作化已基本完成。合作化的农业生产迫切地需要科学技术的支援，同时也为科学技术在农业生产中的推广和应用，提供了广泛的可能性。以研究成果来支援农业生产是农业科学技术人员的光荣而迫切的任务。八年来，我国的农业增产有了显著的成绩，对农业增产的保守思想，不相信合作化的优越性，不相信劳动群众的创造性，不相信科学技术一旦为农民群众所掌握就产生巨大的物质力量是没有任何根据的。八年来，我国的农业科学研究工作是有成绩的，在选育优良作物品种、防治病虫灾害、改进耕作方法、改良土壤肥料、开展水土保持、水利灌溉、繁育牲畜良种、防治畜疫、发展特种作物以及试制改良农具等方面，或多或少地都做出了一些成绩；当然，这些成绩与农业生产的需要比较起来还是很不够的。在农业发展纲要草案中，大约有二十几条直接需要农业科学技术研究工作相配合，并且几乎牵涉到一切农业科学部门。以农业科学研究工作的现状与农业生产大发展的形势比较起来，则是远远地落后了。为了改变这种落后状态，首先必须解决农业科学研究的思想问题。
    聂副总理说，我们从来就主张科学研究工作必须理论结合实际，必须使提高科学水平和为生产建设服务密切相结合。农业科学研究工作则必须根据我国农业的特点，总结我国农民的丰富经验，吸收世界科学的先进成果，创造性地进行研究，为农业增产服务，并不断提高农业科学水平。在这一方面，几年来我国农业科学工作者在党的领导下是有进步的。但是在目前，我国的农业科学研究工作还没有完全按照这一原则去进行。相反的脱离实际，脱离生产，脱离群众的现象还是相当严重的。例如，有些农业科学工作者，不愿意走出温室，不愿意离开城市，更不愿意到内地和山区去，甚至有的研究热带作物而不愿意到海南岛去，有的研究畜牧兽医而不愿意到牧区去，认为群众的经验不科学，下乡妨碍自己的“进步”。他们对农民群众生产实践中的新创造缺乏敏感。对许多丰产区的丰产经验却没有去或不愿意加以认真的总结；他们对农业生产中所提出来的困难问题，缺乏钻研的勇气，很少人愿意研究作物栽培方面的问题。研究题目往往从书本上来，又到书本上去。甚至在实验中不亲自观察，不亲自动手，研究记录只伸手向工人要。这样的科学研究工作是不会有创造性的贡献的，当然也不会给农业生产带来好处。应该坚决地从这种错误的思想方法和工作方法中解脱出来。
    克服个人主义和宗派主义作风，有组织有计划有重点地进行科学研究工作
    聂副总理说，我国幅员广阔，气候、地形、植被等自然环境十分复杂。我国农业历史悠久，群众生产经验十分丰富。农业科学工作者必须从各个不同地区的实际情况出发，深入农村，面向生产，加强调查研究，虚心学习农民的先进经验，加以科学的分析判断，从而制订出自己的研究方向，选择正确的研究课题和采取正确的研究方法；并且将研究成果根据不同的时间、地点、条件加以运用和推广。在农业的大发展中发展我国的农业科学。
    农业生产中所提出来的问题往往是错综复杂的，需要多种学科互相配合，从理论上或实验上进行综合的研究，需要较多的科学工作者进行集体的研究，有的还需要与国营农场、农业合作社或农民群众进行合作研究，才能收到预期的效果。农业科学研究工作任务重，范围广，就学科说，各门学科都是重要的。但是，为使我们的研究工作紧密结合我国当前农业生产的需要，就不能不有轻重缓急之分，特别是在组织人力、物力方面。农业生产地区性很大，农业科学研究机构分散在全国各地，客观上容易形成工作分散和重复，因此，必须适当地组织各学科、各部门、各地区的力量，进行协调和合作，解决最迫切最重要的问题。然而，现在还有些科学工作者却习惯于单干，不愿意与别人合作，强调个人兴趣，反对有组织、有计划、有重点地进行研究工作。以致在一个研究所中研究题目十分分散，甚至一人一题。在各研究所间，研究题目大量重复，像插秧机的研究，全国竟有四十多处同时进行。这次会议上提出的研究课题有二千多个，其中不必要的重复是很多的，彼此缺乏互相联系与合作。各学科之间、各机构之间、各地区之间、科学研究机构、科学研究人员和国营农场、合作社、农民之间的联系合作，就更加稀少了。这种个人主义、宗派主义的工作作风，是与社会主义的科学研究道路根本相违背的。必须加以纠正。因此，在农业科学研究工作中提倡综合的、集体的、有计划、有重点的、相互协作的研究，乃是发展我国农业科学的重要关键。只有这样，才能充分发挥社会主义的优越性，才能充分运用社会主义大生产给农业科学带来的种种有利条件，也才能更便于利用现代科学的丰富成果。农业科学研究部门，在安排自己的研究工作，克服自己工作的缺点的时候，农业部、国务院科学规划委员会的农业组及地方的有关领导部门，都应该给予积极的帮助。
    建立农业科学的领导中心是一项重要任务
    聂副总理指出，为适应我国农业科学研究工作的需要，还必须解决农业科学研究工作的组织领导问题。几年来由于党和政府对农业和农业科学的重视，农业科学事业的发展是很快的，机构和人员的增长比其他各门学科都快，我们现在已经有了一支不小的农业科学队伍——二百零五处农业科学研究机构，二十七所高等农业院校，和一万多名大学毕业以上的科学技术人员。摊子铺开了，但是还没有很好地组织领导起来，未能充分地表现它的战斗力。目前，总起来说是兵多将少，有的地方是有兵无将，也有的专家又未能很好的发挥作用。如何把这支队伍更好地组织起来为农业生产服务是当前的迫切任务。今年年初我们建立了中国农业科学院，应从各方面加强它，支持它，使它成为全国农业科学的领导中心和重点的研究中心，并围绕着这个中心把各农业科学研究机构和高等农业院校组成一个全国的农业科学工作网。农业科学院应该根据全国农业发展纲要修正草案和全国科学技术发展远景规划，提出全国农业科学研究的方向和任务，制订重点研究工作计划，组织全国各有关方面的农业科学研究力量，进行协调和合作，并对我国农业科学的发展采取适当的措施或提出建议。目前农业科学院的力量虽然还不够大，但是它必须向这个方向努力。在党和政府的关怀下，取得各有关部门的支援，经过全国农业科学家的共同努力，这个目标是可以达到的。
    聂副总理说，建立一个科学研究的领导中心是不容易的，但是十分必要的。右派分子反对我们建立科学领导中心，企图分散我国科学力量，篡夺我国的科学工作领导权，使我国科学事业脱离社会主义道路，走向资本主义道路。右派分子的这一阴谋已被我们彻底粉碎了。
    聂副总理说，我国现有的农业科学力量，大部分在各高等农业院校中。有的教师经年不开课，如果能够充分发挥他们的作用，科学研究力量就会很快的增长起来。国务院业已决定把高等农业院校交农业部领导，并把农学院下放由各省、自治区领导，这就为农学院和农业科学研究机构共同在当地党委和政府领导下，开展科学研究工作创造了良好的条件。更便于使生产、教学和科学研究三者密切结合起来。除中国农业科学院所属的专业研究所应从全国范围内安排自己的研究工作外，各地区、省、自治区的研究所必须同农学院密切合作，负担起本地区的农业科学研究中心的任务，实行对专区、县的试验站、实验场在科学技术上的指导，实行对各地农业推广机构的技术指导。各地的国营农场等都是农业科学技术推广的基地，也应该与农业科学研究机关密切合作，并给予试验研究的方便。中国科学院和政府其他部门所属的有关农业方面的研究机构，都要和农业科学院共同合作，为发展农业生产服务。
    充分发挥科学家的作用，重视青年技术人员的培养
    聂副总理说，目前全国大学毕业以上的农业科学技术人员共有一万零八百人，其中高级人员（副研究员副教授以上）共有一千三百人，就研究指导力量来说还是不够的，有些新的学科还是缺门。充分发挥高级科学家的作用，培养年青的科学技术人员是非常重要的。这一方面要求老科学家进一步改造思想和改进工作作风，深入实际，不断提高科学水平，积极培养青年干部，把自己的知识传授给下一代。一方面要求青年科学技术人员尊重老科学家，虚心向老科学家学习。团结一致，形成一个整体，有组织有领导地开展农业科学研究工作。
    农业科学工作中应注意的几个问题
    聂副总理最后提出了农业科学工作中应该注意的几件事情：第一、从农业科学技术研究方面来保证全国农业发展纲要修正草案的实现，贯彻执行科学技术发展远景规划、年度计划和农业科学组织机构的协调方案。
    第二、加强中国农业科学院和国务院科学规划委员会农业组的工作，经常地进行协调、监督与检查。充分发挥现有的人力物力，根据勤俭建国的方针办科学事业。为了工作方便起见，科学规划委员会农业组下可以按照专业设立若干分组，各省、自治区应该加强对本地农业科学研究工作的领导。
    第三、在反右派斗争胜利的基础上，深入开展整风运动，改进工作。加强对知识分子的思想改造。学习马克思列宁主义，学习苏联先进科学技术，同我国实际相结合。全心全意为农业生产和改善农民和全体人民的生活服务。
    第四、切实注意培养工人和农民的农业科学技术干部。
