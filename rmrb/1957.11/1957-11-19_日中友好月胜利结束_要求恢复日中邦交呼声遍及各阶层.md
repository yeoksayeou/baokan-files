Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 18th: The Sino-Japanese Friendship Month, organized by the Japan-China Friendship Association and beginning on October 1st, concluded victoriously on November 17th.

Tanaka Seiitsu, the Secretary-General of the Japan-China Friendship Association Secretariat, made a statement on the achievements of the Friendship Month, saying that the central task of the Sino-Japanese Friendship Month was to stir up public opinion among the Japanese people demanding the restoration of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations. During the Friendship Month, branches of the Japan-China Friendship Association in Tokyo and various regions held various gatherings, allowing the Sino-Japanese friendship movement to penetrate into the broad masses and gaining the support of local governments, members of parliament, and trade unions. This was the greatest achievement.

The Tokyo Metropolitan Government Employees' Union, with over 50,000 workers, and the union councils of many wards in Tokyo, as well as more than 100 ward council members, joined the Japan-China Friendship Association as members. More than 40 regions, including Hokkaido, Kyoto Prefecture, Saga Prefecture, and Ishikawa Prefecture, also held various grand gatherings during the Friendship Month.

On the afternoon of the day the Sino-Japanese Friendship Month ended, the Tokyo Federation of Japan-China Friendship Associations held its youth department's inaugural meeting. This year, the youth department will carry out the following activities: jointly launch a movement with various youth organizations to demand the restoration of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations; call on the Japanese people and youth to concentrate their efforts to urge the Japanese government to realize the conclusion of the fourth Sino-Japanese trade agreement as soon as possible; and promote mutual exchanges between Chinese and Japanese youth through various means.
