    Production of Precision Electrical Instruments
    Shanghai Electric Meter Factory Begins Expansion
    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, November 25th: The state-owned Shanghai Electric Meter Factory began its expansion on the 22nd. The new workshop is expected to be completed in the second quarter of next year. Once it is put into production, it will produce a large number of precision electrical instruments that were previously reliant on imports, supplying the needs of industrial sectors such as metallurgy, petroleum, electric power, and machine manufacturing, as well as scientific research units.
    After the new workshop is completed, the factory will be further expanded, gradually relocating the factory headquarters and major product departments to the new site. Once the entire factory expansion is completed, the output of various industrial electric meters, electrical instruments, and thermal instruments will increase by approximately two times compared to the current level.

    生产精密电工仪器
    上海电表厂开始扩建
    据新华社上海25日电　国营上海电表厂已在22日动工扩建。新车间预计在明年第二季度建成。投入生产后，将大量生产各种一向依靠进口的精密电工仪器，供应冶金、石油、电力、机器制造等工业部门以及科学试验研究单位的需要。
    待新车间建成以后，这个厂还将进一步扩建，把厂本部及主要产品部门逐步迁往新址。这个工厂全部扩建完成后，各种工业用电表、电工仪器和热工仪表的产量，将比目前增加两倍左右。
