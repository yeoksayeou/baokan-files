Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, November 25th. Hungarian coal production in October reached 102% of the average monthly production of the first three quarters of last year. There will be no problem with coal supply for this winter.

The "People's Freedom Daily" published a statement on the 24th by Hungarian Minister of Heavy Industry, Czottner, stating that in the third quarter of this year, the coal mining industry completed 105.1% of its plan. Currently, the coal supply for industry, transportation, government offices, and residents is satisfactory. Public buildings with existing heating equipment have already stored 60% of their winter coal supply.

The Minister said that 26.3% of the mines are now equipped with modern equipment, an increase of 5.5% compared to the same period last year. He also said that one of the important reasons for the good coal supply situation is that during difficult times, the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and other people's democracies shipped us a lot of coal; on the other hand, it is also due to the relatively economical use of coal in the first half of this year.

Xinhua News Agency, Budapest. According to data from the Hungarian Central Bureau of Statistics published in the "People's Freedom Daily" on the 18th, the average daily output of Hungarian industry in September this year exceeded the average daily output of the first nine months of last year by 8%. Among them, the output of light industry and the food industry has increased the fastest. The production of the metallurgical and machine industries has not yet reached the daily output level before September last year.

The daily coal output in September this year was 72,827 tons, which was 91.6% of the average daily output of the first nine months of last year. The current coal storage capacity can already solve 50% to 75% of the winter coal needs of the power industry and residents. Electricity production in the third quarter has reached the level before October last year.

In terms of domestic trade, retail sales of goods in the third quarter were 11% higher than in the same period last year. The sales growth of industrial products is very fast. The value of goods currently in reserve is 15 billion forints, an increase of 5% to 6% compared to September last year.

    匈牙利煤产量迅速增长
    十月份已超过去年头三季度每月平均数
    新华社布达佩斯25日电　匈牙利10月份的煤产量已经达到去年头三个季度平均月产量的102％。今年冬季用煤的供应将不成问题。
    “人民自由报”24日发表的匈牙利重工业部长卓特纳的谈话说，今年第三季度，采煤工业完成了计划的105．1％。目前，对工业、交通、机关和居民用煤的供应是令人满意的。现有暖气设备的公共建筑物的冬季用煤都已经储存了60％。
    这位部长说，目前26．3％的矿井都已经有了现代化装备，这个数目比去年同期增加了5．5％。他又说，煤的供应情况良好的重要原因之一是：在困难时期，苏联、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克和其他人民民主国家运给了我们很多煤；另一方面，也是由于今年上半年用煤比较节省。
    新华社布达佩斯电　据“人民自由报”18日发表的匈牙利中央统计局资料，今年9月份匈牙利工业的平均日产量已经超过去年头九个月平均日产量的8％。其中以轻工业和食品工业的产量增长最快。冶金和机器工业的生产还未达到去年9月前的日产量水平。
    今年9月份煤的日产量是七万二千八百二十七吨，为去年九个月平均日产量的91．6％。现在的储煤量已经能够解决电力工业和居民冬季用煤的50％到75％。第三季度的电力生产已达到去年10月以前的水平。
    在国内贸易方面，第三季度商品零售比去年同时期多了11％。工业品销售额的增长很快。现在储备的商品价值达一百五十亿福林，比去年9月增加了5％到6％。
