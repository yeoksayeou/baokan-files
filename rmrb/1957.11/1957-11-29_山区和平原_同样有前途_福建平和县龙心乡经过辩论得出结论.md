    Mountainous Areas and Plains Offer Equally Bright Futures
    Longxin Township, Pinghe County, Fujian Province, Reaches Conclusion After Debate
    (Reported by our newspaper) Longxin Township in Pinghe County, Fujian Province, is a mountainous area. During the airing of views, some young people suggested: mountainous areas have no future, using machines is hopeless, and life is hard. In particular, some rural youths from wealthy families insisted that "growing up in the mountains means never having a good day in one's life." After studying the matter, the Party branch and work team considered this a common problem among young people and organized them by production team or natural village to debate the question of "do mountainous areas have a future?"
    During the debate, many Communist Youth League members, young people, and peasants from poor and lower-middle peasant backgrounds used vivid facts and their own experiences from the township to illustrate that mountainous areas also have a future.
    Huang Guorong said: "Before liberation, this place was a desolate wilderness. Now, the highway is about to open to our door, and a semi-mechanized sugar factory has already been built on the edge of our township. Currently, a steel plant is also planned to be built in our township. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the desolate mountainous area has become a vibrant new socialist countryside. Mountainous areas can also be built into socialism."
    Wealthy middle peasant Lin Fumu said, "With grain retention so tight, the government wants people to live, but doesn't want people to get too big. How can you say mountainous areas are good?" Fifty-two-year-old farmer Lin Huazai said, "I remember in the old society, we couldn't eat one meal a day. I couldn't bear it any longer, so I reluctantly sold my own child. Now, everyone gets 540 jin of grain a year. How can you young people say grain retention is low? You have no conscience." These words left Lin Fumu speechless.
    However, some young people were still not convinced and said, "Mountainous areas are good, but we don't dress as well as others." So, people compared the scenes of ragged clothes and patched trousers from before liberation with the present: before liberation, young people wore coarse cloth made locally. Now, the young men wear khaki and poplin, and the girls have colorful clothes. Everyone has at least four sets of clothes to change into. Before liberation, very few people in the township wore shoes. Now, everyone has an average of two or three pairs of shoes. How can you say we don't dress well?
    Through the great debate and with the education and help of the old peasants, the more than 450 rural youths in Longxin Township distinguished right from wrong and concluded that mountainous areas and plains have equally bright futures. Many Communist Youth League members and young people expressed their willingness to work in the mountainous areas and actively participate in production. (Liu Hanfan)

    山区和平原　同样有前途
    福建平和县龙心乡经过辩论得出结论
    本报讯　福建平和县龙心乡是一个山区，在鸣放中有的青年提出：山区无前途、用机器没希望、生活苦。特别是出身于富裕家庭的一部分农村青年硬说“生长在山区一辈子也过不了一天好日子。”党支部和工作组研究后，认为这是青年中普遍存在的问题，便以生产队或自然村组织青年辩论“山区有没有前途”的问题。
    辩论中，很多贫农和下中农成份的共青团员、青年和农民，都以本乡生动的事实和本人的经历说明了山区同样有前途。
    黄国荣说：“解放前，我们这里是穷山荒野，现在公路马上就要通车到门口，我们乡边已建成一个半机械化的糖厂，目前，还要在我们乡里兴建一个炼钢厂，在共产党领导下，荒凉的山区已变成朝气勃勃的新农村，山区同样也能建成社会主义。”
    富裕中农林福木说“留粮这么紧，政府要人活，不要人大，还说什么山区好？”五十二岁的老农林华仔说：“记起在旧社会时，一天吃不上一顿饭，实在生活不下去，我才忍心卖掉一个亲生儿，现在每人一年吃到五百四十斤粮食，你们这些青年人还说什么留粮低，实在太没有良心了。”这番话说得林福木哑口无言。
    但是有的青年还不服气说：“山区好，可是穿的不比人家好。”于是又有人把解放前那种破衣破裤、千缝万补的情景和现在作了对比：解放前青年人穿的都是本地土造的粗布，现在小伙子穿的尽是咔叽、府绸，姑娘们都有了花衣服，每人至少也有四套衣服可以替换。解放前全乡很少有人穿鞋，现在每人平均有两三双鞋，怎么能说穿的不好呢？
    龙心乡四百五十多名农村青年，通过大辩论和在老农民的教育帮助下，分清了是非，得出的结论是山区和平原同样有前途。许多共青团员和青年们表示安心在山区工作，积极参加生产。　（留汉凡）
