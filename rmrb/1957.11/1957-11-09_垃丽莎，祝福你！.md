Larissa, Bless You!
	Chen Bochui

	Whenever I sit down at my desk, whether I open a book or pick up a pen, I always look at that exquisite little blue glass pagoda first.

	Of course, this very elegant little pagoda standing upright on the desk can enhance my interest in reading and help my imagination when writing; however, what has fostered this unconscious, habitual action in me is another strange force—the "friendship" shining on it, a warm feeling transmitted from sight to the heart.

	"Yes, it was a pair of small hands holding it, forcibly stuffing it into my pocket. – Larissa!"

	Every time I see the little pagoda, I always murmur this once, always call out this name softly once. Then, a girl with golden short hair, a raised fair face, and sapphire-like eyes twinkling on either side of a straight nose—the image of Larissa flashes beside the little pagoda. She is still smiling with a slightly shy expression.

	It was late Red May, a time of beautiful scenery in Beijing, with flowers blooming, grass growing, and trees green and shady. Our group of three was honored to be invited by the Soviet Overseas Chinese Middle School to meet with the children and participate in their "Book Festival."

	The venue was so spacious and bright. As soon as we walked in, the children warmly crowded around us. Fragrant flowers, kind laughter, filled the air with a thick atmosphere of friendship. Although we could only smile and not speak directly, our laughter was understandable to each other—Long Live Sino-Soviet Friendship!

	As invited guests, I happily and enviously spoke about how they could proudly enjoy the world's most advanced and thoughtful literature, listing some writers and works. They listened with great interest. But it was clear that a girl sitting in the front row, slightly to the left of center, with golden short hair, a raised fair face, and sapphire-like eyes twinkling on either side of a straight nose—Larissa (of course, I only learned her name later), was listening more attentively, almost nodding at the name of every writer and every book. This could not help but attract my attention.

	The "Book Festival" performance began. "Little Red Riding Hood" was followed by "Cinderella," then "The Three Liu Brothers" and "The Snow Queen." Coincidentally, I was guided to a seat in the first row, and Larissa was right next to me. Although she was earnestly appreciating the performance on stage, she kept turning her head to look at me, revealing a slightly shy smile. After the performance, we became acquainted.

	During the break, she accompanied me to one side. Just as a translator comrade walked over, she stopped him, and we started chatting.

	"In the fairy tale you told, could that cat eventually fly or not?" she asked, her blue eyes fixed on me.

	I smiled and asked back, "What do you think?"

	"No," she shook her head.

	"Why?" I asked again.

	"It's proud."

	"Why can't it fly if it's proud?" I continued to ask. A slightly shy smile appeared on her fair face. "If it's proud, it won't be willing to study seriously, even if it really grows wings, it can't fly!"

	I was secretly surprised and admired her methodical analysis, and I couldn't help but squeeze her hand, smiling without saying a word.

	Suddenly, drums and horns sounded, and the entertainment began. Ring toss, skipping rope, passing the ball, group dance, … Larissa stayed with me the whole time. When the amusing "three-legged race" started, Larissa took the initiative to cooperate with me, gesturing to me how to coordinate our movements, and softly shouting rhythmically: "Raz, dva! Raz, dva!" (meaning "One, two! One, two!") As soon as the whistle blew, we advanced quickly and in unison according to the planned "Raz, dva! Raz, dva!" Sure enough, we won the championship, leaving the runner-up far behind. The teachers watched us, this "victorious Sino-Soviet friendly cooperation," with wide eyes, nodding and smiling, "Ochen' khorosho!" ("Very good!")

	As everyone watched us go to receive the award with envious eyes, an exquisite, blue glass pagoda stood upright in front of us. Of course, the key to the victory lay in Larissa's wisdom, the credit should go to her, and the little pagoda should also belong to her. But she refused to accept it no matter what, and insisted on stuffing the little pagoda into my pocket. I was embarrassed and reluctant to refuse outright, so I asked the translator comrade to explain the reason. How did Larissa answer? Her reason was even greater than mine: "Honored guest! – Politeness! – Sino-Soviet friendship!" I once again shook her hand tightly and excitedly accepted the little pagoda.

	I was silently thinking, "This is practically receiving a gift from Larissa." And Larissa really signed her name on her own landscape postcard and stuffed it into my hand.

	"Ah—" I was momentarily stunned and grateful, unable to speak. "What a clever girl! She is a Soviet little citizen who has grown up in the sunshine since the October Revolution!"

	For more than a year, an exquisite, blue glass pagoda has stood gracefully on my desk. I cherish it because I cherish Larissa's friendship, and because I see it day and night, I often miss Larissa, and because I miss Larissa, I often imagine the image of the little pagoda as the golden spire of the Kremlin, and at the same time, I seem to hear the song "Moscow-Beijing" in my ears.

	Larissa, this new generation of Lenin and Stalin, has not been seen for more than a year. I think she has grown taller, smarter, and more thoughtful. Under the education and cultivation of the communist spirit, there is no doubt that she will be cultivated into a Red warrior with Bolshevik vigor, actively participating in the construction of the communist cause, and defending world peace. – I cannot help but imagine, with ardent admiration, the beautiful little white birch tree growing on the Russian land under the sunshine.

	On the occasion of celebrating the fortieth anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution, dear Larissa, I bless you!

### 垃丽莎，祝福你！

专栏：节日的怀念

    垃丽莎，祝福你！
    陈伯吹
    每当我在书桌旁坐下来时，不论打开书本也好，拿起笔杆来也好，老是先要望一望那座玲珑的蓝色的玻璃小宝塔。
    固然这座很有风度的小宝塔陡立在书桌上面，是可以增进我阅读时的兴趣，也可以帮助我写作时的遐想；然而养成我这不自觉的习惯性的动作，还有它另外一股奇异的力量——在那上面闪耀着“友谊”的光芒，从视线传导到心房的一股温暖的感觉。
    “是啊，是一双小手捧着了硬塞在我袋里的。——拉丽莎！”
    每一回看见小宝塔，总要这么默念一次，总要这么轻轻地叫唤一声。随后，一个覆盖着金黄色的短发、仰起着白晰的脸蛋、端正的鼻子两旁闪动着蓝宝石似的眼睛的女孩子——拉丽莎的形象就在小宝塔旁边闪现出来。她还是带一点儿羞涩的脸色微笑着。
    正是红五月下旬，北京好风光的日子，花开草长，树绿成荫。我们一行三个，光荣地被苏侨中学邀去和孩子们见面，并且参加他们的“书节”。
    会场那么宽敞，明亮。当我们一走进去，孩子们亲亲热热地涌过来。芬芳的花朵，亲切的笑语，洋溢着一片浓厚的友谊的气氛。虽然我们只能笑，不能直接会话，可是彼此的笑声是听得懂的——中苏友好万岁！
    作为被邀请的客人，我高兴又羡慕地讲着他们能够自豪地享受世界上最先进、最有思想的文学，列举了一些作家和作品。他们很感兴趣地倾听着。但是可以看得出来，坐在最前一排中间偏左的一个复盖着金黄色的短发、仰起着白晰的脸蛋、端正的鼻子两旁闪动着蓝宝石似的眼睛的女孩子——拉丽莎，（当然在后来我才知道她这个名字）更聚精会神地、几乎对每一个作家和每一本书的名字都点一下头。这就不能不引起了我的注意。
      “书节”的表演开始了。“小红帽”后面是“灰姑娘”，接着是“刘氏三兄弟”和“雪皇后”。十分凑巧的是我被导引在第一排的座位上，拉丽莎恰恰在我的左边。她虽然很认真地欣赏着台上的表演，却还不住地侧过头来望着我，露出带一点儿羞涩的脸色微笑着。节目看完了，我们也就熟悉起来。
    在休息的时候，她伴着我在一旁。恰好有个翻译同志走过来，她拉住了他，我们就攀谈起来。
    “您讲的童话里的那只猫，后来究竟能飞不能飞？”她问，蓝眼睛盯着我看。
    我笑了，反问了一句：“依你看呢？”
      “不能。”她摇一摇头。
      “为什么？”我再问。
      “它骄傲。”
      “为什么骄傲了就不能飞呢？”我追问下去。她那白晰的脸蛋上浮起了带一点儿羞涩的笑。“骄傲了就不肯认真学习，即使真的长了翅膀，也不能飞啊！”
    我暗暗吃惊地佩服她有条有理的思想分析，不觉握紧了她的手，笑着没说出话来。
    鼓声、号声突然响起来，余兴开始了。投环、跳绳、传球、集体舞，……拉丽莎始终和我在一块儿玩。等到“三脚竞走”这个饶有趣味的节目上场，拉丽莎主动地要和我合作，用手势向我比划着怎样协同一致地动作，嘴里还有节奏地轻轻喊着：“拉斯，—特伐！拉斯，—特伐！”（意即“一，二！一，二！”）哨子一响，我们就按照预定计划“拉斯，—特伐！拉斯，—特伐！”地迅速齐步前进，果然夺得了冠军，而且把亚军抛落得很远。教师们张大着眼睛瞧着我们这个“胜利的中苏友好合作”点头微笑，“喔欣——赫勒舍！”（“很好”的意思）
    大家用羡慕的眼光目送着我们去领奖时，一座玲珑的、蓝色的玻璃小宝塔陡立在我们面前。当然，得胜的关键性在于拉丽莎的智慧，功劳应该归于她，小宝塔也该归于她。可是她无论如何不肯接受，硬把小宝塔塞在我衣袋里。我又窘、又不便峻拒，找了翻译同志来说理由。拉丽莎怎样回答呢？她的理由比我的还大：“贵宾！——礼貌！——苏中友谊！”我再一次紧握着她的手，激动地收下了小宝塔。
    我正默默地想着：“这在实际上简直是收受了拉丽莎的礼物了。”而拉丽莎真的把自己的风景画片，签上了名字又塞到我的手里来。
      “啊——”我一时又惊愕、又感谢地说不出话来。“多么聪明的女孩子！是十月革命以后在阳光中成长起来的苏维埃小公民！”
    一座玲珑的、蓝色的玻璃小宝塔，一年多来一直绰约有致地陡立在书桌上。我因为珍视拉丽莎的友谊而珍视着它，也因为朝夕看见它而常常怀念着拉丽莎，更因为怀念拉丽莎而常常把小宝塔的形象幻想成克里姆林宫的金色的尖顶，同时在耳畔仿佛响起了“莫斯科—北京”的歌声。
    拉丽莎，这个列宁—斯大林的新一代，有一年多没见面了，想来她更长大、更聪明、更有思想了。在共产主义精神的教育和教养下，不容置疑，她一定会被培养成为具有布尔什维克式朝气的、积极参加共产主义事业建设的、保卫世界和平的红色战士。——我禁不住怀着热烈的欣羡的心情，想像着在阳光普照下的俄罗斯大地上、正在成长着的美丽的小白桦树。
    在庆祝伟大的十月社会主义革命四十周年纪念的日子里，亲爱的拉丽莎，我祝福你！
