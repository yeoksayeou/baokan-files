Since the health departments clearly stipulated that provincial and regional hospitals are the centers for local medical and preventative technical guidance, responsible for helping lower-level medical institutions improve their technical level, technical guidance work has been widely carried out at all levels of medical institutions throughout the country.

In order to train and improve the cadres of rural medical institutions, many provincial hospitals and regional and municipal hospitals have adopted short-term clinical training methods. For example, Anyi County Hospital in Shanxi Province (formerly Yuncheng People's Hospital in Jinan Prefecture) has trained 126 medical assistants, 268 nursing staff, 33 laboratory personnel, and 200 maternal and child health workers for various counties over the past few years. After short-term clinical training, these personnel have significantly improved their medical theoretical foundation and practical work level. Before 1952, most of the 17 county health centers in the former Yuncheng Prefecture were unable to perform abdominal surgery. After sending people to study at the original Yuncheng People's Hospital and other hospitals, each county can now perform abdominal surgery.

Some hospitals adopt the method of regularly organizing experienced physicians, nurses, and other medical personnel to participate in the work of lower-level hospitals to help solve difficult problems; or, in response to local epidemics and common diseases, combined with the technical problems existing in the hospital, they hold technical seminars, reports, and case discussions to implement technical guidance. For example, in nearly 20 days, the working group of Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital conducted 23 major ward rounds in Mianyang and Neijiang regional hospitals, performed 18 various operations, conducted 10 academic reports with approximately 3,500 listeners, and held 19 seminars on medical and nursing aspects. The confidence of the hospital staff has been greatly improved, and the patients warmly welcome them.

Many hospitals have achieved remarkable results in helping lower-level medical institutions improve their infectious disease prevention and treatment technology. For example, the Nanchang Regional Hospital in Jiangxi Province transferred the president and director of medical affairs to guide the counties in the treatment of schistosomiasis and the prevention and treatment of epidemic cerebrospinal meningitis, enabling the majority of medical personnel to basically master the theory and practical skills of antimony therapy, as well as the differential diagnosis and treatment methods of meningitis.

At present, a consultation system has also been widely established among medical institutions at all levels. When a regional or county hospital encounters a difficult or complicated patient that it cannot handle, it sends a written medical record to a physician at a higher-level hospital for guidance, and if necessary, the patient can be transferred to the higher-level hospital for treatment. In case of emergency or critically ill patients, physicians from higher-level hospitals can be invited for consultation and assist in consultations and treatment of some difficult and complicated patients. Academic reports or case discussions held in generally larger hospitals also frequently absorb the participation of staff from rural medical institutions in nearby areas.

In addition, Jiangxi, Fujian, and other provinces plan to implement short-term rotations of cadres among medical institutions at all levels, or for higher-level hospitals to transfer experienced physicians to work in rural medical institutions. This measure in the allocation of cadres will greatly help to rapidly improve the quality of rural medical care.

    对乡村医疗机构加强技术指导
    各省医院和专区医院做出许多成绩
    本报讯　自从卫生部门明确规定了以省医院和专区医院为地方医疗预防技术指导的中心，负有帮助下级医疗机构提高技术水平的责任以后，全国各地普遍开展了医疗机构逐级技术指导工作。
    为了培养提高乡村医疗机构的干部，许多省医院和专区医院、市医院，采取短期临床进修的方式。如山西省安邑县医院（原晋南专区运城人民医院），几年来为各县培养了一百二十六名医士、二百六十八名护理员、三十三名化验人员和二百名妇幼保健员。这些人员经过短期临床进修，医学理论基础和实际工作水平都有相当提高，原运城专区十七个县卫生院，在1952年以前大都不能作腹部手术，经派人到原运城人民医院和其他医院学习后，现在各县都可作腹部手术了。
    有的医院采取定期组织有经验的医师、护士和其他医务人员参加下级医院工作，帮助解决疑难问题；或者是针对当地的流行病和多发病，结合医院技术方面存在的问题召开技术座谈会、报告会、病历讨论会，实行技术指导。如四川省人民医院工作组在绵阳、内江两个专区医院近二十天内，共进行大查房二十三次，施行各种手术十八人次，进行了十次学术报告，听讲人数约三千五百人次，并召开医疗、护理方面的座谈会十九次。医院工作人员的信心大为提高，病人热烈欢迎。
    许多医院帮助下级医疗机构提高传染病预防治疗技术取得显著成绩。如江西省南昌专区医院抽调院长和医务主任下去指导各县治疗血吸虫病和防治流行性脑脊髓膜炎，使多数医务人员基本上掌握了锑剂治疗的理论与实际技能，以及脑膜炎的鉴别诊断和治疗方法。
    目前，在各级医疗机构之间还较普遍地建立了会诊制度。当专区医院或县医院遇有不能处理的疑难病人时，将书面病历送给上级医院的医师提出指导性意见，必要时可以转院治疗。遇有急重病人，可以请上级医院医师出诊，同时协助作一些疑难病人的会诊和治疗工作。在一般较大医院中举行的学术报告会或病历讨论会，也经常吸收附近地区乡村医疗机构的工作人员参加。
    此外，江西、福建等省计划实行各级医疗机构间的干部短期轮换，或由上级医院抽调有经验的医师到乡村医疗机构去工作。在干部分配上的这种措施，将大大有助于乡村医疗质量的迅速提高。
