    "Flying Pigeon"
    Ke Wen
    Two years ago, I bought a Flying Pigeon brand bicycle.
    At that time, we lived in the city, but the factory was in the eastern suburbs. Every time I went to and from work, I had to spend more than an hour on the road. So, my wife and I discussed using our savings from more than two years to buy a bicycle. At first, my wife disagreed, saying that the child was slowly growing up, and expenses would gradually increase. If we had another child, the future expenses would be even greater. Actually, these reasons were valid, but buying a car wouldn't affect our lives. My wife and I's salaries, after deducting the necessary expenses each month, still had some savings. Moreover, the need for a bicycle was so urgent at the time. After discussion, we finally reached an agreement with my wife: to buy a women's bike, which both of us could ride.
    This was the first time in my life that I rode my own new bike. Fifteen years ago, when I was an apprentice, an old bike belonging to a cousin was lent to me. It was an old, clumsy, and tall bike. The tires were almost worn flat, and the handlebars were rusted. But I still loved it. I rode that bike for five years, and it was so broken that it didn't look like a bike anymore. At that time, due to soaring prices, although I could already earn money, my wages still had to support my family, so there was no way I could buy a new bike.
    Now, I can actually use my own savings to buy a brand-new bike, and it's a top-quality domestic product!
    I installed black velvet seat covers, bright red axle tassels, and a shiny dynamo light on this bike. When I saw my distorted face in the convex headlight shell that looked like a funhouse mirror, I often burst out laughing.
    So, I promoted the goodness of the "Flying Pigeon" bike everywhere, saying how good the quality was, spreading from one workshop to another. Comrades all liked this bike. This was of course not only because of my promotion, but it really was a good bike.
    The following year, the factory built many new residences, and we moved to the new dormitory. At this time, my wife was still working in the city, so she often rode this bike.
    One day, I had just arrived at the workshop and was putting on my work clothes. The fitter, Old Liu, grabbed me from behind and said, "Come and see the new bike I bought. My 'Flying Pigeon' is much better than yours."
    Before I could even put on my sleeves, Old Liu dragged me to the bicycle shed. There was already a group of people there, evaluating this new "Flying Pigeon" manufactured in 1956. We squeezed through, and saw that it was also a Flying Pigeon women's bike. The body was green, and the paint was thick and shiny. There was also a rack on the back. I tried the freewheel and the front and rear axles, and it was indeed better quality than mine.
    I asked him, "How much did you buy it for?" I thought to myself that this one, which was manufactured later, would probably be more expensive.
    "One hundred and sixty, what do you think?"
    "It's not more expensive than yours!" Little Zhang interjected from the side.
    "It seems that these bikes are getting better and better." I said.
    Sure enough, this summer, we discovered the third batch of new "Flying Pigeons," which were even better than last year's batch. Old Liu told me about this too. He said, "Do you know? Now people are lining up in the city before dawn to buy 'Flying Pigeons'." I was very surprised and asked him, "How so?"
    "You don't know yet? A new batch has come out, better than the ones we bought, and the price is still one hundred and sixty. People are saying: 'Flying Pigeon' quality is comparable to imported goods."
    When I got home, I told my wife about the new "Flying Pigeon." She didn't say a word, just "hmph"-ed. Who knew that the next day when I came home, she had ridden back a new "Flying Pigeon." She said that the comrades in her factory had bought it. She had specially swapped bikes with that comrade to show me. This bike's frame was curved, and the body was purple-red. Just looking at it, it was much prettier than the previous two types. The body was very light, obviously made of alloy steel. I rode it around on the road for a lap, and it was effortless to pedal and made no noise at all. Great!
    After dinner, we talked about this again. My wife said, "I said not to buy it the year before last, but you insisted on buying it. What's the hurry in buying it two years later?"
    I said, "Anyway, our bike is not bad."
    "You're always extravagant. You always suffer a little loss no matter what you do." My wife said, and stood up to go to the yard to cool off. She was obviously angry with me.
    My wife's younger sister, Hui Zhen, was doing arithmetic problems under the lamp. At this time, she looked up at her sister's back, stuck out her tongue, and giggled.
    "Little Hui Zhen, what are you laughing at?" I asked her.
    "She's still a worker! The cars produced by the country are getting better every year, and she's not happy and keeps complaining about suffering a loss!"

    “飞鸽”
    柯文
    两年前，我买了一辆飞鸽牌的自行车。
    那时候，我们住在城里，工厂却在东郊。每次上下班，总要在路上耽搁一小时以上。于是我和妻商量，打算动用我们那一笔两年多积下来的存款，买一辆自行车。开始妻不同意，说是孩子慢慢地长大了，花费要逐渐多起来，如果再有了孩子，将来的开支还会更多些。其实这些道理也对，但毕竟买辆车还不致影响我们的生活，我和妻两人的工资，每月除掉必要的开支，还可以有些结余。况且对于自行车的需要，当时又是那样迫切。经过商量，终于与妻达成协议：买一辆女车，我们两人都能骑。
    这是我生平第一次骑上自己的新的车子。十五年前，我还做徒工的时候，一位堂兄的旧车子借给我骑。那是个破旧、粗笨而高大的车子，车胎几乎已经磨平了，车把也生了锈。但我还是喜爱它的。那辆车，我一直骑了五年，车破得简直不像样子了。那时，由于物价飞涨，虽然我已经能挣钱了，但是我的工钱还要维持一家人的生活，哪有可能买新车呢？
    如今，我居然能够以自己的积蓄，买一辆崭新的车子了，而且是国产的上等货色！
    我给这辆车安上了黑绒的座套，大红的轴毛，镀得雪亮的车灯和磨电。当我从前面那个像哈哈镜似的凸面的车灯外壳上，照见自己那张变了形的脸，我往往会放声笑起来。
    于是我到处宣传“飞鸽”车好，说质量如何好，从这个车间传到那个车间，同志们都喜爱起这辆车来。这当然不仅是因为我的宣传，也确实是辆好车。
    第二年，工厂修建了许多新住宅，我们便迁到新的宿舍来，这时妻仍在城里工作，这辆车便经常由她骑了。
    有一天，我刚到车间，正在穿工服，钳工老刘从后面一把拉住我说：“快来看看我新买的车，我这辆‘飞鸽’可比你那辆强多了。”
    我还没来得及伸上袖子就被老刘一阵风拉到车房去。那里早有一群人在品评这辆1956年出厂的新“飞鸽”了。我们挤过去，看见这也是一辆飞鸽女车，车身是绿色的，漆很厚而且发亮。后面还多了一个架子。我试试飞轮和前后轴，的确比我的那一辆质量还好。
    我问他：“你多少钱买的？”我心里想，这比头年出厂的，价钱怕要高些了。
      “一百六，怎样？”
      “并不比你的贵呀！”小张在一旁插嘴。
    “看样子，这车是越出越好了。”我说。
    果然不出所料，今年夏天，我们发现了第三批新“飞鸽”，比去年的那一批更好了。这也是老刘告诉我的。他说“你知道吗？现在城里天不亮就有人排队买‘飞鸽’。”我很吃惊，问他：“怎么？”
    “你还不知道哩，又新出了一批，比咱们买的都好，价钱还是一百六。人们都说：‘飞鸽’的质量抵得上进口货”。
    回到家里，我和妻说到新“飞鸽”的事。她一句话没说，只“哼”了一声。谁知第二天回家，她骑回了一辆新“飞鸽”。说是她们厂里的同志买的。她特地与那位同志换了骑，来给我看看的。这辆车梁是弯的，车身是紫红色，光看样子，也比以前的两种漂亮多了。车身很轻，显然是合金钢制的。我骑上它在马路上兜了一个圈子，蹬起来毫不费力，而且没有一点声音。真棒！
    晚饭后，又谈起这事。妻说：“前年我说不买，你偏要买，晚两年买有什么要紧。”
    我说：“反正咱们那辆车也不错。”
    “你这家伙总是大手大脚，干什么都得吃点亏。”妻说着，站起来到院里乘凉去了。显然是在生我的气。
    妻的妹妹慧珍正在灯下作算术题，这时抬起头来望着她姐姐的背影，吐吐舌头，吃吃地笑了。
    “小慧珍，你笑什么？”我问她。
    “亏她还是工人！国家生产的车一年比一年好，她不高兴，还净嚷吃亏呢！”
