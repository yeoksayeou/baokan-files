Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, November 17th: The reconstruction of Angang's No. 8 Blast Furnace was completed thirty days ahead of schedule, and iron tapping began yesterday.

After the reconstruction of this blast furnace, the daily production of pig iron has increased by nearly 100 tons compared to the past, which is equivalent to building a small iron smelting furnace for the country.

The reconstruction project of the No. 8 Blast Furnace was originally planned to take ninety days. Due to the close cooperation of the construction units and the study of advanced Soviet experience, a new record for the rapid reconstruction of blast furnaces was created.
