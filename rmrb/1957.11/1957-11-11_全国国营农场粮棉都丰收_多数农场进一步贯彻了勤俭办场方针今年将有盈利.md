Xinhua News Agency, 9th Dispatch: Newly compiled statistics from the Ministry of State Farms and Land Reclamation indicate that this year, state farms nationwide will achieve bumper harvests of grain crops and economic crops such as soybeans and cotton.

This year, China's 710 state farms and ranches expanded their sown area by nearly three million mu compared to 1956. The per-unit area yield of grain crops has increased, with an average yield of over 210 jin per mu, approximately a 4% increase compared to 1956. It is estimated that this year's total grain output will be over 1.4 billion jin, soybeans over 200 million jin, and cotton (lint) over 400,000 dan. Compared to 1956, the total grain output increased by more than one-third, while soybeans and cotton approximately doubled. The average cotton yield per mu was 63 jin, an increase of approximately 24% compared to last year.

This year, state farms across the country made utmost efforts to overcome the threats of drought and flooding, ensuring good harvests. Heilongjiang Province, where state farms account for a relatively large proportion, experienced heavy rainfall last autumn and heavy snowfall this spring, making land preparation and sowing extremely difficult. The farms in this province overcame these unfavorable conditions, carried out a series of field management practices, and achieved a bumper wheat harvest. For example, farms in the Mishan area not only completed the sowing tasks but also created an outstanding average wheat yield of 160 jin per mu on more than 300,000 mu (the vast majority of which was newly reclaimed wasteland). The rice harvests in the Bohai region and the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River were also relatively good.

Before sowing this year, state farms across the country widely carried out regional experience exchange work. The farms also reorganized their organizational structures, and non-production personnel participated in production. As a result, this year's production has taken another step forward compared to the past.

Since 1953, the grain output of China's state farms has been increasing year by year, and hog production has also been continuously developing. The number of hogs on state farms has now reached over 400,000, an increase of 88.7% compared to 1956 and 21 times compared to 1952. Due to the farms' diversified operations, development of pig farming, and further implementation of the policy of increasing production and practicing economy and running farms diligently and frugally, most farms are expected to be profitable this year.

    全国国营农场粮棉都丰收
    多数农场进一步贯彻了勤俭办场方针今年将有盈利
    新华社9日讯　农垦部新近汇总的统计材料表明：今年我国国营农场的粮食作物和大豆、棉花等经济作物都将获得丰收。
    今年我国七百一十个国营农场、牧场，播种面积比1956年扩大近三百万亩，粮食单位面积产量有所提高，平均每亩产量达二百一十余斤，比1956年每亩约增产4％。预计今年粮食总产量为十四亿多斤、大豆为二亿多斤、棉花（皮棉）为四十余万担。与1956年比较，粮食总产量增加三分之一强，大豆、棉花约增加一倍左右，棉花每亩平均产量六十三斤，比去年约增产24％。
    今年各国营农场以最大的努力战胜了干旱和雨涝的威胁，保证了良好的收成。国营农场比重较大的黑龙江省，去秋多雨，今春多雪，整地和播种都非常艰难，这个省的农场克服了这些不利条件，进行了一系列的田间管理，获得了小麦丰收。如密山地区的农场，不仅完成了播种任务，而且还在三十多万亩（绝大部分是新开的荒地）大面积的土地上创造了小麦每亩平均一百六十斤的优异成绩。渤海地区和长江中下游地区各农场的水稻收成也都比较好。
    各国营农场今年在播种前，都广泛地进行了地区性的交流经验工作，各农场又整顿了组织机构，非生产人员参加了生产，因此今年的生产比过去又跃进了一步。
    1953年以来，我国国营农场的粮食产量逐年增加，生猪生产也不断发展，现在国营农场的生猪已发展到四十多万头，比1956年增加88．7％，比1952年增加二十一倍。由于农场开展了多种经营，发展了养猪事业和进一步贯彻了增产节约、勤俭办场的方针，多数农场今年都将有盈利。（附图片）
