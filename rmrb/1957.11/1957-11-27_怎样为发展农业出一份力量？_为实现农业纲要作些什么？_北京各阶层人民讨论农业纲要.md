    In the past few days, the Party organizations of various organs, organizations, factories, enterprises, schools, and suburbs throughout the city have formulated or are formulating specific plans for publicizing and discussing the revised draft of the National Agricultural Development Program, and many units have begun to discuss it item by item. Teachers and students of Beijing Agricultural University began studying on the 16th, and Liao Luyan, Minister of Agriculture, gave a report to the teachers and students of the school on issues such as the revised draft of the Agricultural Development Program. On the 21st, Liao Luyan also gave a report on the Agricultural Development Program to the responsible persons of the Party committees and Party propaganda cadres of various departments in Beijing. At the Second Rural Work Conference of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, attended by more than 1,300 district, township, and commune cadres, township and commune cadres discussed the revised draft of the National Agricultural Development Program and prepared to organize suburban farmers to discuss it after returning. The cadres of the Beijing Municipal People's Committee and various bureaus will spend a month discussing this document starting from the 20th. The cadres of the Beijing Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau and the Supervision Bureau have already completed the discussion of the document item by item in four days. Zhao Delu, a cadre of the Beijing Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau, said: "Through studying, I have seen the prospects for rural development and am ready to go to the countryside at any time to contribute my share to the development of agriculture." Most of the employees in Beijing's construction system have begun discussions, which will end at the end of November.
    The Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China recently formulated a plan to organize the people of the city to discuss the revised draft of the National Agricultural Development Program from 1956 to 1967 and held a special meeting to make arrangements. In the plan, the Beijing Municipal Committee requires Party organizations at all levels to earnestly lead the publicity and discussion of the revised draft of the National Agricultural Development Program, conduct a socialist ideological education for people of all strata, and at the same time, pay attention to soliciting opinions from people of all strata, especially farmers, on the revised draft of the program. The plan requires urban people, especially intellectuals and cadres, to focus on studying the two questions of "how to contribute to the development of agriculture" and "what can be done to realize the forty-article program" in the discussion, and to criticize the ideas of belittling agriculture and agricultural labor. Organs, factories, enterprises, and schools that are directly related to agriculture should conduct discussions in combination with the rectification work of their departments according to the requirements of the revised draft of the National Agricultural Development Program. Street residents should discuss issues such as thrift in managing households, improving environmental sanitation, and eliminating rats, flies, and mosquitoes.

    北京各阶层人民讨论农业纲要
    新华社专讯北京市各阶层人民正在宣传和讨论全国农业发展纲要修正草案。
    这几天来，全市各机关、团体、工厂、企业、学校和郊区的党的组织，已经或正在制订宣传和讨论全国农业发展纲要修正草案的具体计划，许多单位已开始逐条讨论。北京农业大学师生在16日开始了学习，农业部部长廖鲁言向这个学校的师生作了关于农业发展纲要修正草案等问题的报告。21日廖鲁言又向北京市的各部门的党委负责人和党的宣传干部作了关于农业发展纲要的报告。有一千三百多个区、乡、社干部参加的中共北京市委第二次农村工作会议上，乡、社干部讨论了全国农业发展纲要修正草案，准备回去后组织郊区农民进行讨论。北京市人民委员会和各局的机关干部从20日起，将用一个月的时间讨论这个文件。北京市民政局、监察局已经在四天内把文件逐条讨论完毕。北京市民政局干部赵德禄说：“通过学习，看到了农村发展的远景，准备随时到农村去，为发展农业尽自己一份力量。”北京市的建筑系统的职工，大部已开始讨论，将在11月底讨论结束。
    中共北京市委最近制订了关于组织全市人民讨论1956年到1967年全国农业发展纲要修正草案的计划，并且召开专门会议作了布置。北京市委在计划中要求各级党的组织必须认真地领导关于全国农业发展纲要修正草案的宣传和讨论，对各阶层人民进行一次社会主义思想教育，同时应当注意征求各阶层人民特别是农民对纲要修正草案的修改意见。计划中要求城市人民特别是知识分子和干部，在讨论中应该着重研究“怎样为发展农业出一份力量”“为实现四十条纲要能够作些什么”等两个问题，并且批判轻视农业和农业劳动的思想。和农业方面有直接关系的机关、工厂、企业和学校，应该根据全国农业发展纲要修正草案的要求，结合本部门的整改工作来进行讨论。街道居民要讨论勤俭持家、改善环境卫生和消灭老鼠、苍蝇、蚊子等问题。
