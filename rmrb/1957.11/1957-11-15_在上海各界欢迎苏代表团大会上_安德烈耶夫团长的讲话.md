Comrades!
These days, working people all over the world, together with the Soviet people, are celebrating the fortieth anniversary of the October Revolution as if it were their own great national festival.

At the invitation of the National Committee of the Chinese people celebrating the fortieth anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution, various circles in the Soviet Union sent a delegation to People's China to participate in your celebration of the fortieth anniversary of the Great October Revolution.

Dear friends! Comrades fighting for communism! On behalf of various Soviet social organizations and all the Soviet people, I extend my greetings to you, and on behalf of all the Soviet people, I sincerely wish you further achievements in the great cause of socialist construction in People's China.

Comrades, the more distant the memorable day of the October Revolution becomes, and the more the socialist camp expands, the more obvious the great significance of the October Revolution for the destiny of our people and all mankind becomes.

The victorious October Socialist Revolution immediately solved the fundamental problems of the insurgent people: it established Soviet power. The working people became the true masters of their own lives. The Soviet regime eliminated exploitation of man by man, abolished all forms of enslavement, handed over all land to the peasants, abolished all unequal treaties signed by Tsarist Russia with foreign countries, and declared complete equality for all nationalities. The October Revolution effectively ended the First Imperialist World War, which was fought for the benefit of a handful of imperialists.

The victory of the socialist revolution in Russia filled the working people of all countries, especially the colonial peoples suffering under imperialism, with the confidence to liberate themselves.

It is quite clear that not only the Russian reactionaries opposed the young Soviet Republic, but also the imperialists of the whole world, who immediately imposed a brutal civil war on the Soviet people. But the Soviet people gloriously repelled this attack and crushed the armed forces of the Russian reactionaries and foreign aggressors.

Comrades! Why was the numerically smaller Russian working class able to carry out such a profound socialist revolution, crush the Russian reactionaries, repel the attacks of world capitalism, eliminate aggressors from all sides, and, under difficult conditions, restore the national economy destroyed by two wars, establish a first-class socialist industry, and build a socialist society?

Many factors guaranteed the victory of the socialist revolution in our country:

First, even before the October Revolution, the domestic and foreign policies of the bourgeoisie, the landlord class, and all bourgeois and petty-bourgeois parties had already gone bankrupt, and they had exposed themselves to the workers and peasants as traitors and enemies of their own people.

Second, this was the self-sacrificing spirit and true heroism shown by the working class under the leadership of the Communist Party in unswervingly seizing power and resolutely defending the victorious fruits of the struggle against the exploiting classes.

Third, the solid alliance of workers and peasants formed in the flames of the prelude to the October Revolution and after the October Revolution. Without this alliance, the victory of the socialist revolution would not have been possible.

Fourth, the support of the working classes of all countries for the first socialist revolution and the Soviet Republic. The role of this support was particularly evident in the struggle to eliminate foreign aggressors. Without the sincere assistance of the working people of the world, it would have been difficult for the Soviet people to consolidate their achievements and successfully carry out socialist construction.

However, the most important and decisive condition for guaranteeing the victory of the Great October Revolution and all subsequent struggles and stages of socialist construction was the existence of a force that led the people: the Bolshevik Party established and led by the great Lenin.

Comrades! Our country's entire revolutionary experience—the experience of the civil war, the experience of socialist construction, and the experience of the Patriotic War—tells us that without such a battle-tested vanguard of the Communist Party, the working class and all the people of our country could not have achieved all the victories on their glorious forty-year path.

Chinese comrades, I think that based on your own personal experience, you will deeply appreciate that without your glorious Communist Party, the victories achieved by the great Chinese people in the past and today would have been inconceivable.

Dear comrades! The forty-year road taken by the Soviet people since the October Revolution has been a road of overcoming the enormous difficulties of Russia's past economic and cultural backwardness. During these forty years, the Soviet people spent almost eighteen years engaged in socialist construction in an environment of war. Of course, there are difficulties now, and there will be difficulties in the future, but there is no doubt that the main difficulties have passed.

The Soviet people have fundamentally transformed their country on a socialist basis.

The Soviet Union has established a first-class socialist industry, developed the country's electrification, and equipped agriculture, collective farms, and state farms with sophisticated technology, which has made it possible to greatly increase the sown area.

The level already reached in industry and agriculture makes it possible for the Soviet people to propose a specific task—to catch up with and surpass the most developed capitalist country, the United States, in economic terms within the next ten to fifteen years. Based on fully reliable estimates, we believe that the Soviet Union will definitely be able to accomplish this task.

In many aspects of scientific and technological development, the Soviet Union is now not only not lagging behind, but is also far ahead of the developed capitalist countries, including the United States.

In the Soviet Union, an excellent army of scientists and technicians and many scientific research institutions have been built up, bringing about changes in many sectors of science and technology, such as rocket technology, aviation, and many other sectors. The Soviet Union has successfully launched two artificial satellites, ushering in a new era for mankind's conquest of the universe.

In the cultural sphere, the Soviet Union has long since eliminated illiteracy and has begun to further transition to universal secondary education for young people. The Soviet Union has cultivated a large number of Soviet intellectuals.

From the point of view of defending national defense, the Soviet Union has demonstrated the superiority of its armed forces over the armies of the leading imperialist countries.

Comrades! In short, this is a summary of the Soviet people's forty years. This is a summary of the victory of socialism in the Soviet Union.

However, for the entire socialist cause, our victory is not just these, because the main issue is that the Soviet Union is no longer isolated today. Another twelve countries, including 700 million people, have embarked on the path opened up by the October Revolution. The invincible strength of the socialist camp also lies in the friendship between the people of these countries.

Comrades, today I would like to particularly emphasize the great significance of the friendship between two great nations—the Soviet Union and People's China. The confluence of these two forces can make the cause of socialism completely invincible and achieve success in the cause of peace.

The friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples has deep roots. The fraternal unity of our two great nations is forged on the common ideological foundation of socialism and communism. The friendship and alliance between the Soviet Union and China is forged with the blood of the sons and daughters of our two nations. We, the Soviet people, will never forget the sons and daughters of the Chinese people who fought side by side with us in our country during the years of the October Revolution and the Civil War.

Today, on the occasion of the fortieth anniversary of the October Revolution, let us attribute immortal glory to the 30,000 Chinese soldiers who once took up arms and directly participated in the October Revolution and defended the young Soviet Republic!

The friendship and alliance between our two great countries was also forged by the common struggle of the Soviet and Chinese peoples against Japanese imperialism during World War II.

This people's friendship, born in the flames of struggle for common interests between our two countries, is eternal and unbreakable.

Comrades! The Soviet people are watching with great interest and personal participation how People's China is completing a truly great leap from backwardness to advancement and achieving socialist victories in all areas of the people's economy, culture, and material life.

The Soviet people are happy for the remarkable achievements made by the Chinese people in the cause of China's industrialization. Because industry is the foundation for the socialist transformation of the entire life of the country. We Soviets are very familiar with the enormous difficulties we faced in establishing a socialist industry. Of course, you also have difficulties now, but we firmly believe that the hard-working Chinese people will overcome all the difficulties encountered on the road to building their own powerful socialist industry.

As for the Soviet people, we have done, are doing, and will do everything in our power to help our Chinese brothers solve a major task in the shortest possible time—building a powerful socialist industry in their own country.

We have a common goal, a common cause—building a communist society. Therefore, the Soviet people see themselves merely as a member of the international socialist camp, and regard their assistance to People's China not as some kind of debt, but as their direct internationalist obligation.

We Soviets are pleased that the Chinese people have solved the most difficult problem of achieving the victory of the socialist revolution in the countryside in a relatively short period of time.

The Soviet people celebrate all these achievements of their loyal friends and brothers—the Chinese people—with joy, and wish them even greater success in the great cause of socialist construction!

We know that all these achievements of the Chinese people are the result of the wise leadership of the glorious Chinese Communist Party, the vanguard of the Chinese working people, who have been tested in battle.

The Soviet people infinitely admire the heroism of the Chinese Communist Party, headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, and its steadfastness and thoroughness in Marxism-Leninism.

Dear comrades, please allow me, once again, on behalf of our Soviet people, to express my warm and sincere greetings to you, and to wish you victory in the great cause of building a new socialist China.

Long live the great Chinese people and the glorious Chinese Communist Party!

May the unbreakable friendly cooperation between the Soviet and Chinese peoples prosper and last forever!

Long live world peace!

    在上海各界欢迎苏代表团大会上
    安德烈耶夫团长的讲话亲爱的同志们：
    这些天来，全世界劳动人民和苏联人民一起像庆祝自己本国的伟大节日一样，欢庆十月革命四十周年。
    苏联各界应中国人民庆祝伟大十月社会主义革命四十周年的全国委员会的邀请，派遣了自己的代表团来到人民中国，参加你们庆祝伟大十月革命四十周年的纪念活动。
    亲爱的朋友们！为共产主义奋斗的战友们！我代表苏联各个社会团体以及全体苏联人民向你们致意，并代表全体苏联人民衷心地祝你们在人民中国社会主义建设的伟大工作中取得进一步的成就。
    同志们，十月革命这个值得纪念的日子历史愈是悠久，社会主义的阵线愈是扩大，那末十月革命对于我国人民和全人类命运的重大意义也就愈加明显。
    取得了胜利的十月社会主义革命立即解决了起义人民的根本问题：建立了苏维埃政权。劳动人民成为自己生活的真正主人。苏维埃政权消灭了人对人的剥削，废除了一切奴役形式，把全部土地交给了农民，取消了沙皇俄国同外国签订的一切不平等条约，并宣布一切民族完全平等。十月革命实际上结束了为一小撮帝国主义分子的利益而进行的第一次帝国主义的世界大战。
    社会主义革命在俄国所取得的胜利，使各国劳动人民、特别是受帝国主义蹂躏的殖民地人民充满了解放自己的信心。
    十分明显，反对年轻的苏维埃共和国的不仅有俄国反动派，而且还有全世界帝国主义分子，他们立即把一场残酷的内战强加于苏联人民的身上。但是苏联人民光荣地打退了这场进攻，粉碎了俄国反动派和外国侵略者的武装力量。
    同志们！为什么人数较少的俄国工人阶级能够实现这么一次深刻的社会主义革命，粉碎俄国反动派，打退世界资本主义的进攻，消灭来自各方的侵略者，并在艰苦的条件下，恢复了为两次战争所破坏了的国民经济，建立起头等的社会主义工业和建成社会主义社会呢？
    保证了社会主义革命在我国取得胜利是有许多因素的：
    第一，还在十月革命以前，资产阶级、地主阶级以及所有的资产阶级和小资产阶级的政党的对内、对外政策就已经破产了，而且在工人和农民的面前暴露出自己是本国人民的叛徒和敌人。
    第二，这是工人阶级在共产党领导下，毫不动摇地夺取了政权并坚决保卫战胜剥削阶级的胜利成果中所表现的自我牺牲精神和真正的英雄主义。
    第三，在十月革命序幕战斗的火焰里以及十月革命以后所形成的巩固的工农联盟。没有这个联盟，社会主义革命的胜利也是不可能的。
    第四，各国工人阶级对第一次社会主义革命和苏维埃共和国的支持。这种支持所起的作用特别明显地表现在肃清外国侵略者的斗争中。没有世界劳动人民的真诚援助，苏联人民很难巩固自己所取得的胜利，并胜利地进行社会主义建设。
    但是，保证伟大十月革命以及其后的历次斗争和社会主义建设各个阶段取得胜利的最重要、最有决定意义的条件，是具有了这样的领导人民的力量：即伟大列宁所建立和领导的布尔什维克党。
    同志们！我国的全部革命经验——内战的经验，社会主义建设的经验和卫国战争的经验都告诉我们，没有共产党这样久经考验的战斗先锋队，我国工人阶级和全体人民就不能在自己的光荣的四十年道路上取得全部胜利。
    中国同志们，我想你们根据自己的亲身经验，一定会深刻地体会到：没有你们光荣的共产党，伟大的中国人民过去和今天所取得的胜利将会是不可设想的。
    亲爱的同志们！十月革命以后，苏联人民所走的四十年道路是克服过去俄国在经济上与文化上落后的巨大困难的道路。四十年中，苏联人民几乎有十八年的时间是在战争的环境里进行社会主义建设的。当然，困难现在有，将来还会有，但是有一点是毫无疑问的，这就是主要困难已经过去了。
    苏联人民已经从根本上把自己的国家在社会主义的基础上改造过来了。
    苏联建立了头等的社会主义工业，发展了国家的电气化事业，农业、集体农庄和国营农场也装备了精湛的技术，这就有可能大大地增加播种面积。
    工业、农业已经达到的水平，使苏联人民有可能提出这样一项具体任务——在最近的十年到十五年之间，在经济方面赶上并超过最发达的资本主义国家——美国。根据充分可靠的估计，我们相信苏联一定能够完成这项任务。
    苏联在科学技术发展的许多方面现在不仅不落后，而且大大地超过了发达的资本主义国家，其中也包括美国。
    在苏联，已经建设起一支优秀的科学技术大军和许多科学研究机构，在科学技术的许多部门，比如说，在火箭技术、航空以及许多其他部门中，引起了变革。苏联已经顺利地发射了两颗人造卫星，他们开辟了人类征服宇宙的新纪元。
    在文化领域里，苏联早已消灭了文盲，而且开始进一步地过渡到对青年进行普遍的中等教育。苏联已经培养了人类众多的苏维埃知识分子。
    从保卫国防的观点来看，苏联已经表明自己的武装力量有超过头等的帝国主义国家军队的优越性。
    同志们！简单说来，这就是苏联人民四十年来的总结。这便是社会主义在苏联胜利的总结。
    但是，对于整个社会主义事业来说，我们的胜利，不仅只有这一些，因为主要的问题在于：苏联今天已经不再是孤立的了。已经有包括七亿人口的另外十二个国家走上了十月革命所开辟的道路。社会主义阵营不可战胜的力量，也正在于这些国家人民之间的友谊。
    同志们，我今天想特别着重指出两个伟大民族——苏联与人民中国之间的友谊巨大意义。这两种力量的汇合就能够使社会主义事业完全不可战胜，使和平事业取得成就。
    中苏两国人民的友谊有着深远的根源。我们两大民族的兄弟团结是由社会主义和共产主义的共同的思想基础结成的。苏中两国的友谊和同盟是我们两个民族的儿女用鲜血凝成的。我们苏联人民永远不会忘记十月革命和国内战争的年代在我国和我们并肩作战的中国人民的儿女。
    今天，在十月革命四十周年的日子里，我们要把不朽的光荣归于曾经拿着武器、直接参加十月革命和保卫年轻的苏维埃共和国的三万名中国战士们！
    我们两个伟大国家之间的友谊和同盟也是由苏中人民在第二次世界大战期间反击日本帝国主义的共同斗争结成的。
    我们两个国家为了共同的利益在斗争的火焰里诞生的这种人民友谊是永恒的和牢不可破的。
    同志们！苏联人民怀着最大的兴趣和亲身参加的心情，注视着人民中国是怎样在完成从落后到先进的真正巨大的飞跃。并在人民经济、文化和物质生活的一切领域中取得社会主义的胜利。
    苏联人民为中国人民在中国工业化事业中获得的卓越成就而感到高兴。因为工业是对国家的整个生活进行社会主义改造的基础。我们苏维埃人十分熟悉自己在建立社会主义工业中的巨大困难。当然，现在你们也有困难，但是我们坚决相信，勤劳的中国人民一定会克服在建设自己强大的社会主义工业道路上所遇的全部困难。
    至于苏联人民，那么我们过去、现在将来都要竭尽一切力量帮助自己的中国兄弟，在最短期间解决一个主要的任务——建设本国的强大的社会主义工业。
    我们跟你们有着共同的目标，共同的事业——建设共产主义社会，因此，苏联人民把自己看成仅仅是国际社会主义阵营的队伍中的一员，把自己对人民中国的帮助不是看成某种债务，而认为是自己的直接的国际主义义务。
    我们苏联人感到高兴的是，中国人民在较短的时期中解决了社会主义革命在农村中取得胜利的最困难的问题。
    苏联人民以欢欣的心情庆祝自己的忠实友人与兄弟——中国人民的这一切成就，并祝它在社会主义建设的伟大事业中取得更进一步的成就！
    我们知道，中国人民的这一切成就是在战斗中久经考验的中国劳动人民的先锋队——光荣的中国共产党英明领导的结果。
    苏联人民无限钦佩以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党的英勇精神，及其对马克思列宁主义的坚定性和彻底性。
    亲爱的同志们，请允许我再一次以我们苏联人民的名义，向你们表示热烈的和真诚的敬礼，并祝你们在建设社会主义新中国的伟大事业中取得胜利。
    伟大的中国人民和光荣的中国共产党万岁！
    祝苏中两国人民牢不可破的友好合作日益繁荣和万世长存！
    世界和平万岁！
