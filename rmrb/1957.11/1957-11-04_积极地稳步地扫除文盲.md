Actively and Steadily Eliminate Illiteracy
Hebei Province Sees a Batch of Cultural Villages
    (Our Dispatch) As of now, Hebei Province has eliminated illiteracy among more than 2.8 million workers and peasants. More than 13,000 primary cadres at the township level have escaped illiteracy. Together with more than 16,500 cadres at the county and district levels who were previously made literate, illiteracy has been basically eliminated among rural cadres above the township level throughout the province. A number of cultural villages with eliminated illiteracy have begun to emerge in various places.
    After correcting the impetuous mood in 1956, the work of eliminating illiteracy in Hebei Province generally saw right-leaning conservative thinking, and the phenomenon of negativity and slackness was relatively serious. For example, according to the statistics of 15 counties in the Zhangjiakou area in August this year, a total of only 25,000 people were studying, while Zhangbei County in the same area, due to strengthened leadership, had more than 22,000 people persisting in learning. This shows that negative conservative thinking must be overcome for the work of eliminating illiteracy to develop and persist.
    This winter and next year, Hebei Province plans to organize 3.8 million farmers to enroll in schools and eliminate illiteracy for 600,000 people. In addition, it is also necessary to actively develop spare-time middle and primary schools. Appropriately increase production knowledge in the courses of spare-time middle and primary schools to meet the needs of production development.

    Zunhua County Prepares for Winter School
    (Our Dispatch) In order to carry out the work of eliminating illiteracy this winter and make this year's winter school plan feasible, the Education Bureau of Zunhua County, Hebei Province, sent people to conduct investigations in three different types of villages in early September and assisted each township in conducting investigations from village to village and household to household. Through these efforts, a comprehensive understanding of the illiteracy situation, enrollment targets, learning forms, teacher conditions, and leadership strength in each village was gained. On this basis, a plan for 55,000 people to participate in learning this winter was formulated, pointing out the goals for this winter's illiteracy elimination work.
    Since the correction of excessively high and rushed illiteracy elimination plans in 1956, some people have only emphasized difficulties and failed to see the new favorable conditions, showing timidity and depression in the work of eliminating illiteracy. To solve this problem, the County Education Bureau held a forum to unify and correct ideological understanding by summarizing achievements, examining shortcomings, and exchanging work experience, laying the ideological foundation for carrying out winter illiteracy elimination.
    In order to adapt to the needs of the new situation this winter, the county began to adjust the ranks of private school teachers at the end of August. Now, there are 606 villages in the county, with more than 2,800 private school teachers, including more than 230 middle and primary school graduates who returned to their hometowns this year. In order to help them improve their teaching level, the County Education Bureau plans to train township cultural and educational cadres and village head teachers separately.

    Cultivate a Habit of Learning Culture
    Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, 1st - Guizhou Province recently held a provincial rural illiteracy elimination work conference, which determined that 1 million to 1.3 million people will be organized to enroll in schools throughout the province this winter and spring, and 100,000 people will reach the illiteracy elimination graduation standard by the fall of next year.
    Up to now, 300,000 farmers of all ethnic groups in Guizhou Province have escaped illiteracy. They generally recognize about 1,500 characters, can read newspapers, write letters, and some can even write simple summaries. Previously, nine out of ten farmers in the mountainous areas of Guizhou did not know how to read. Since 1951, winter schools have been opened and literacy night schools have been organized in rural areas every year, gradually cultivating a habit of learning culture. In the spring of 1956, the peak of agricultural cooperativization, more than 2.37 million farmers in the province participated in cultural learning.

    Civilian Schools Everywhere in Cities and Villages
    Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 1st - In Anhui Province, more than 800,000 working people who were originally illiterate can now recognize about 1,500 characters. A number of villages without illiteracy have also appeared in counties such as Ningguo, Jixi, and He County.
    In order to further meet the needs of the masses to learn culture, a large number of spare-time primary and middle schools have been established in various places recently. Now, there are civilian schools everywhere in cities and villages throughout the province, basically forming a spare-time cultural education network. These civilian schools play a very important role. Many farmers who were illiterate in the past are now serving as work recorders and accountants; some have learned from civilian schools and are now serving as civilian school teachers; and some have already used the cultural knowledge they have mastered to study agricultural technology.

    积极地稳步地扫除文盲
    河北出现一批文化村
    本报讯　河北省到目前为止，已经从工农群众中扫除了二百八十多万文盲，有一万三千多名乡的主要干部摆脱了文盲状态，连同过去扫除文盲的一万六千五百多名县、区干部，在全省范围内基本上扫除了农村乡以上脱产干部中的文盲。各地开始出现了一批扫除文盲的文化村。
    河北省的扫除文盲工作，在1956年纠正急躁情绪之后，比较普遍地发生了右倾保守思想，消极松劲现象比较严重。如今年8月间张家口专区十五个县的统计，总共只有二万五千人学习，而该区的张北县由于加强了领导，在同一时期就有二万二千多人坚持学习。这说明了必须克服消极保守思想，扫除文盲工作才能有所发展和坚持下去。
    今冬明年河北省要求组织三百八十万农民入学，扫除六十万文盲。此外，还要积极发展业余中、小学。在业余中、小学课程里适当增加生产知识等，以适应生产发展的需要。

    遵化县进行冬学准备
    本报讯　河北省遵化县为了开展今冬扫除文盲工作，使今年的冬学计划切实可行，9月上旬县教育局派人深入三种不同类型的村子进行调查，并协助各乡逐村逐户调查。通过这些工作，对各村文盲情况、入学对象、学习形式、教师条件和领导力量等都作了全面了解。在这个基础上，制定了全县今冬五万五千人参加学习的计划，给今冬扫盲工作指出了奋斗目标。
    从1956年纠正扫盲规划偏高偏急以后，有的人只强调困难，看不到新的有利条件，在扫盲工作上表现畏缩消沉。为了解决这个问题，县教育局召开了座谈会，通过总结成绩，检查缺点和交流工作经验，统一端正思想认识，奠定了开展冬季扫盲的思想基础。
    为了适应今冬新的形势需要，该县从8月底就开始调整民校教师的队伍。现在，全县有六百零六个村子，有民校教师两千八百多人，其中今年回乡的中小学毕业生有二百三十多人。为了帮助他们提高教学水平，县教育局准备分别训练乡文教干部和村主任教师。

    养成学习文化的风气
    新华社贵阳1日电　贵州省最近召开全省农村扫盲工作会议，确定今冬明春在全省范围内组织一百万到一百三十万人入学，到明年秋前有十万人达到扫盲毕业标准。
    到目前止，贵州省已有三十万各族农民摆脱了文盲的状态。他们一般都认识了一千五百字左右，能看报、写信，有的还能写出简单总结。以前，贵州山区农民十个有九个不识字。从1951年起，农村里年年开办冬学和组织识字夜校，逐渐地养成了学习文化的风气。在农业合作化高潮的1956年春天，全省参加学习文化的农民曾达到二百三十七万多人。
    城市农村到处有民校
    据新华社合肥1日电　安徽省已经有八十多万原来是文盲的劳动人民，现在能认识字一千五百个左右。在宁国、绩溪、和县等县还出现了一批无文盲村。
    为了进一步满足群众学习文化的要求，近来各地大量举办了业余小学和中学。现在，全省在城市和农村到处有民校，已基本上形成一个业余文化教育网。这些民校很起作用。有许多过去是文盲的农民，现在担任了记工员、会计；有的从民校学习出来，又担任了民校教师；有的已经用自己掌握的文化知识去钻研农业技术。
