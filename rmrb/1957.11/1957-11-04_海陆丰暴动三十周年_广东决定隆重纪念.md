Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 3rd November - The Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Guangdong Provincial People's Committee recently decided to solemnly commemorate the 30th anniversary of the Hailufeng Uprising in Haifeng and Lufeng counties. The "Preparatory Committee for the 30th Anniversary of the Hailufeng Soviet" has been established. A grand commemorative meeting will be held in Haifeng County, the "Red Capital" thirty years ago. Gu Dacun, Secretary of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Deputy Governor of Guangdong Province, will personally preside over the event.

The Hailufeng Soviet regime was one of the earliest worker-peasant revolutionary regimes in China. It was established on November 21, 1927, and failed in March 1928. At that time, Martyr Peng Pai, representing the Party Central Committee, came directly to Haifeng County to lead and preside over the establishment of the Hailufeng Soviet regime.
