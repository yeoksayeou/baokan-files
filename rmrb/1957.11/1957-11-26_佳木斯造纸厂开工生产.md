Jiamusi Paper Mill Starts Production

    (Our report) The Jiamusi Integrated Pulp and Paper Mill, built with Soviet assistance, solemnly held an acceptance ceremony and production commencement meeting on the 23rd.

    Wu Shengxiu, Chairman of the State Acceptance Committee and Vice Minister of Light Industry, pointed out in his speech that the completion of the Jiamusi Integrated Pulp and Paper Mill is another crystallization of the profound friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people; its completion marks a new development in China's paper industry. Fe. Ki. Valaksin, head of the Soviet delegation invited by China to attend the opening ceremony of the Jiamusi Integrated Pulp and Paper Mill and Minister of the Paper and Wood Processing Industry of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, also spoke at the meeting, congratulating the completion of the factory. Wang Hefeng, Secretary of the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, An Zhicheng, Vice Chairman of the China Light Industry Trade Union, Zhao Yunpeng, Mayor of Jiamusi, and Stoliping, a representative of the Soviet experts who helped build the factory, also spoke.

    After this modern factory is put into production, it will produce 50,000 tons of industrial technical paper annually, which is almost twice the output of industrial technical paper in our country last year. Cable paper, impregnated paper, electrical winding paper, telephone paper, tube paper, base paper, and cement bag paper, which our country could not produce or could not produce in large quantities in the past, will be produced in large quantities here. The cement bag paper produced by this factory annually can be used to package 5 million tons of cement; cable paper has the characteristics of heat resistance, insulation, corrosion resistance, and acid resistance, and is a good material for protecting overhead, underground, and submarine cables; cable insulation paper is used to wrap transformers, communication equipment, and other electrical equipment, and is also an indispensable material for the automobile industry. This factory will also gradually trial-produce special industrial papers such as optical insulation paper, semiconductor paper, and high-voltage cable paper, which are urgently needed for China's industrial construction.

    佳木斯造纸厂开工生产
    本报讯　苏联帮助我国建设的佳木斯综合纸浆造纸厂，在23日隆重举行了工程验收和开工生产典礼大会。
    国家验收委员会主任委员、轻工业部副部长吴生秀，在讲话中指出：佳木斯综合纸浆造纸厂的建成，是中苏两国人民深厚友谊的又一结晶；它的建成标志着我国造纸工业的新发展。应我国邀请参加佳木斯综合纸浆造纸厂开工生产典礼的苏联代表团团长、俄罗斯苏维埃联邦社会主义共和国造纸及木材加工工业部部长费·基·瓦拉克辛也在会上讲话，祝贺这个工厂的建成。中共黑龙江省委员会书记王鹤峰、中国轻工业工会副主席安志诚、佳木斯市长赵云鹏和帮助这个厂建设的苏联专家代表斯托力平等也讲了话。
    这座现代化工厂投入生产以后，每年将生产五万吨工业技术用纸，差不多相当于我国去年工业技术用纸产量的两倍。我国过去不能生产或不能大量生产的电缆纸、浸渍纸、电气卷缠纸、电话用纸、管纸、抄纸、原纸、水泥袋纸等，都将从这里大量生产出来。这个厂年产的水泥袋纸，可用来包装五百万吨水泥；电缆纸具有耐热、绝缘、防腐、防酸等特点，是用来保护高空地下和海底电缆的好材料；电缆的绝缘纸是用来包扎变压器、通讯器材及其他电器设备，也是汽车工业等不可缺少的材料。这个厂还要逐步试制我国工业建设所急需的光绝缘纸、半导体纸、高压电缆纸等特殊工业用纸。
