    The Song of Youth
    ——Remembering the Beijing University Students' Choir
    Peng Lizhao
    "Time is moving forward,
    Life is boiling,
    The socialist tide is like a mighty army
    Galloping on the land of the motherland..."

    "Young people ride the steeds of the times and sing forward,
    For the prosperity and strength of the motherland,
    Dedicate the glorious youth to the lofty ideals of communism."

    This is the song "The Steeds of Youth are Galloping" sung by the Beijing University Students' Choir. It is full of the youthful vigor of young students, expressing the happy life of students in the new China after liberation and their determination to participate in the socialist construction of the motherland.

    The Beijing University Students' Choir was established in March 1955. Initially, it was a mixed choir of one hundred and eighty people, and now it has grown to six hundred people, divided into mixed, male, folk song and other types of choirs.

    Students in Beijing, especially university students, are no strangers to this choir. The Beijing University Students' Choir often sings beautiful songs for students of various universities, adding a lot of lively and educational content to university life. At the same time, they also perform for many commemorative meetings and foreign guests. This year, six members participated in the folk song team of Chinese youth attending the World Youth Festival.

    On Sundays, groups of young men and women come to Tsinghua University, Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology, and Renmin University of China from various schools. They are all members of the choir. Beautiful voices spread throughout every corner of the school, rising and falling. The members deeply understand that socialism is a magnificent song, and life is a song that can never be finished. They are the masters of life, and this endless power encourages them to actively participate in the choir's activities.

    The male and female small chorus groups of Tsinghua University often participate in various performances in the school, playing a significant role in promoting the school's cultural and recreational activities. Now Tsinghua University students have more than a dozen societies such as dance, fine arts, and chorus, and four to five hundred students participate in the activities, enlivening the student cultural and recreational life of Tsinghua University.

    In the past two years, the Beijing University Students' Choir has not only established contacts with university student choirs in Shanghai, Nanjing, Xi'an and other places, but also established close ties with the Moscow University Students' Choir, and has received support from all aspects, enriching the content of the choir's activities.

    青春的歌声
    ——记北京市大学生合唱团
    彭利钊
    “时间在前进，
    生活在沸腾，
    社会主义的浪潮像千军万马
    在祖国的大地上飞奔……”，
    “青年们骑上时代的骏马高歌前进，
    为祖国的繁荣富强，
    为共产主义的崇高理想献出光辉的青春。”
    这是北京市大学生合唱团唱的“青年的骏马在飞奔”的歌声。它充满了青年学生的蓬勃朝气，表现了解放以后新中国学生的幸福生活和他们参加祖国社会主义建设的决心。
    北京市大学生合唱团是1955年3月成立的，当初是一个一百八十人的混声合唱团，现在已经发展为六百人，分成混声、男声、民歌等不同类型的合唱团。
    北京的学生，尤其是北京的大学生，对这个合唱团是不陌生的。北京市大学生合唱团经常为各个大学的学生演唱优美的歌曲，给大学生活中增添了不少生动而富有教育意义的内容。同时，他们还为许多纪念会和外宾演出，今年有六名队员参加了我国青年参加世界青年联欢节的民歌队。
    星期日，一群群的小伙子和姑娘，从各个学校来到清华大学、北京钢铁工业学院和中国人民大学，他们都是合唱团的成员。优美的嗓音传遍学校的每个角落，此起彼伏。团员们深深地体会了社会主义就是一首雄壮的歌，生活又是一首唱不完的歌。他们是生活的主人，这种无穷无尽的力量鼓舞他们积极参加合唱团的活动。
    清华大学的男声、女声小合唱组，经常在学校里参加各种演出活动，对推动学校的文娱活动起了不少作用。现在清华大学的学生有舞蹈、美术、合唱等十几个社团，参加活动的学生有四、五百人，活跃了清华大学的学生文娱生活。
    两年来，北京市大学生合唱团不仅同上海、南京、西安等地的大学生合唱团建立了联系，而且同莫斯科大学生合唱团建立了亲密的联系，得到了各方面的支持，丰富了合唱团活动的内容。
