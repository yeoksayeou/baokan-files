Xinhua News Agency, 20th dispatch: The Ministry of Railways has decided to abolish the railway sub-bureau as a management level, with the local railway administrations directly leading the grassroots production units. After the abolition of the sub-bureaus, the administrative structure of the administrations will not only not be expanded, but will also be streamlined. Various departments will be appropriately merged, and the administrative staff of the administrations (including those from the abolished sub-bureaus) will be reduced by approximately 30% to 50%.

An official from the relevant department of the Ministry of Railways told Xinhua reporters that the abolition of the railway sub-bureau is a major improvement in China's railway management system. This measure was decided after more than a year of deliberation, discussion, and in-depth investigation and research, and was approved by the State Council.

The Ministry of Railways currently leads fifteen railway administrations, which in turn oversee forty-four railway sub-bureaus. The aforementioned decision to abolish the railway sub-bureaus will be implemented from January 1, 1958.

The official said that in view of the fact that some railway administrations with excessively large workloads may have difficulties in transportation command and management of railways in certain areas after the abolition of railway sub-bureaus, the Ministry of Railways has made appropriate adjustments to the jurisdictional boundaries of railway administrations nationwide. The State Council has also approved the establishment of Nanchang and Mudanjiang Railway Administrations starting in 1958, and Xi'an and Baotou Railway Administrations starting in 1959. In order to meet the growing needs of railway transportation in the new industrial bases, the Xi'an Railway Management Sub-bureau, under the leadership of the Zhengzhou Railway Administration, will be retained before the establishment of the Xi'an and Baotou Railway Administrations, and the Baotou Railway Management Sub-bureau will be established first from next year.

When asked about the necessity and significance of abolishing the railway sub-bureaus, the official from the Ministry of Railways said that with the changes in China's political and economic situation and the improvement of railway planning management and technical management levels, the railway sub-bureau as a management level is no longer suited to the current situation. Abolishing the railway sub-bureau will bring railway transportation command closer to the grassroots level and reduce bureaucratic leadership, which will play a major role in improving work efficiency.

The official said that when the railway administrations were established in 1950, the old railway foundation was very poor, and our experience in railway management was insufficient. Therefore, management sub-bureaus were established under the administrations to be responsible for railway management within a small geographical area. After 1953, it was felt that a management sub-bureau was in charge of everything, and the technical strength was insufficient. Therefore, it was changed to a transportation sub-bureau, which only managed transportation. Locomotive, engineering, electrical, etc., were all directly led by the administration. Only the management sub-bureaus under the original Sino-Soviet Joint Railway Administration were retained in order to consolidate the experience of the original Sino-Soviet Joint Railway. From 1953 to the present, this measure has played a certain historical role in strengthening China's railway transportation, but it has also created problems: railway transportation requires the cooperation of all parties, including locomotives, freight cars, and passenger cars, as well as communication equipment and guaranteed line quality. After the locomotive, engineering, electrical, etc., on the railway are all led by the administration, uncoordinated phenomena often occur between the administration and the sub-bureau. On the one hand, this affects the administration's ability to carry out more effective comprehensive economic management and brings inconvenience and difficulties to the sub-bureau and various grassroots production units in the process of carrying out tasks. On the other hand, it also adds many difficulties to the party committee's unified leadership of enterprises and the implementation of democratic management. Therefore, under the current objective conditions, it has become necessary to abolish the railway sub-bureau.

In order to focus on studying the work arrangements after the abolition of the railway sub-bureaus and the streamlining of the administrative structure, the Ministry of Railways recently held a national conference of directors of railway administrations. In accordance with the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the CPC, the conference studied the issue of improving the railway system in a manner appropriate to local conditions, appropriate to the matter, and based on facts. The conference decided that after the abolition of the railway sub-bureaus, the administrative structure of the administrations will not only not be expanded, but will also be streamlined or appropriately merged. A large number of management and technical personnel freed up after streamlining the structure will be sent down to stations and sections to enrich and strengthen the production units.

At the same time as the abolition of the sub-bureaus, the Ministry of Railways, in accordance with the spirit of the State Council's regulations on improving the industrial management system, put forward opinions on the division of powers between the Ministry of Railways and the administrations, and increased the management authority of the administrations in order to give play to the initiative and enthusiasm of the principals of the administrations.

In view of the fact that after the abolition of the railway sub-bureaus, technical reorganization must be carried out in order to ensure the unity of transportation command and avoid operational confusion, the Ministry of Railways has put forward corresponding measures and plans to hold a national railway transportation conference and an electrical affairs conference in the near future to study relevant issues.

### 铁路管理体制的重大改进  撤销铁路分局使运输的指挥更接近基层

    铁路管理体制的重大改进
    撤销铁路分局使运输的指挥更接近基层
    据新华社20日讯　铁道部决定撤销铁路分局这一层管理机构，由各地的铁路管理局直接领导基层的生产单位。撤销分局以后，管理局的机构不仅不扩大，而且还要加以紧缩，各个部门要适当合并，管理局机关的管理人员（包括撤销分局在内）要减少30％到50％左右。
    铁道部有关部门一位负责人对新华社记者说，撤销铁路分局是我国铁路管理体制上的一项重大的改进。这项措施是经过一年多时间的酝酿讨论和深入调查研究以后才决定的，并且经过国务院的批准。
    铁道部现在领导十五个铁路管理局，下设四十四个铁路分局。上述撤销铁路分局的决定将从1958年1月1日起执行。
    负责人说，鉴于撤销铁路分局以后，原来有些业务量太大的铁路管理局对某些地区铁路的运输指挥与管理将有困难，因此铁道部对全国各个铁路管理局的管界作了适当的调整。国务院还批准从1958年起新成立南昌、牡丹江两个铁路管理局，从1959年起成立西安、包头两个铁路管理局。为了适应新的工业基地铁路运输日益发展的需要，在西安、包头两个铁路管理局未成立前，仍保留属郑州铁路管理局领导的西安铁路管理分局，并从明年起先成立包头铁路管理分局。
    当记者问到撤销铁路分局的必要性和它的意义时，铁道部这位负责人说，随着我国政治经济情况的变化和铁路计划管理与技术管理水平的提高，铁路分局这一层管理机构同当前的情况已不相适应了。撤销铁路分局将使铁路运输的指挥更加接近基层，减少领导的官僚主义，这对提高工作效率将起重大的作用。
    负责人说，在1950年成立铁路管理局时，由于旧铁路底子很烂，加上我们管理铁路的经验还不足，所以在管理局下面还成立管理分局，负责一个小地区范围内的铁路管理。1953年以后，感到一个管理分局样样都管，技术力量又嫌不足，因而就改成运输分局，只管运输，机务、工务、电务等等都由管理局直接领导。只是对原来中长铁路管理局下设的管理分局，为了巩固原中长铁路的经验，仍加以保留。从1953年到现在，这项措施对加强我国铁路的运输起了一定的历史作用，但是也发生了这样的问题：即铁路运输要有各方面的配合，要有机车、货车和客车，还要有通讯设备和保证线路质量，当铁路上的机务、工务、电务等等都由管理局领导以后，管理局同分局之间时常产生不协调的现象。这一方面影响了管理局作更有效的全面经济管理，并给分局和各基层生产单位在执行任务过程中带来了不便和困难；另一方面对党委统一领导企业和实行民主管理也增加了不少困难。因此在当前客观条件具备的情况下，撤销铁路分局就成为必要了。
    为了集中研究撤销铁路分局后的工作安排和紧缩管理局机构问题，铁道部在最近曾经召开了全国铁路管理局局长会议。这次会议根据中共八届三中全会的精神，因地制宜、因事制宜和实事求是地研究了改进铁路体制的问题。会议决定：撤销铁路分局后，管理局的机构不仅不扩大，而且还要加以紧缩或适当合并。紧缩机构以后腾出的大批管理人员和技术人员，将下放到站、段，充实和加强生产单位。
    在撤销分局的同时，铁道部还根据国务院关于改进工业管理体制的规定的精神，提出了铁道部与管理局分权的意见，加大了管理局的管理权限，以便发挥管理局主管人员工作的主动性和积极性。
    鉴于撤销铁路分局后必须在技术上重新进行组织，才能保证运输指挥的统一和避免业务上的混乱，铁道部已经提出相应的措施，并且计划在最近召开全国铁路车务会议和电务会议，研究有关的问题。
