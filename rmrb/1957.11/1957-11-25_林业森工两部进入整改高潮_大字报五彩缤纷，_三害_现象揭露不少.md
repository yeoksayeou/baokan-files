The Ministry of Forestry and Ministry of Forest Industry Enter Rectification Climax
    Colorful Big-Character Posters Expose Many "Three Evils" Phenomena

    (Our newspaper's dispatch) Since the rectification movement in the Ministry of Forestry and the Ministry of Forest Industry entered the third stage, focusing on rectification, it has developed very rapidly. On the morning of October 30th, Vice Minister Luo Yuanchuan summarized the anti-Rightist struggle of the previous five months and made a mobilization report for rectification. The enthusiasm of the masses was very high. Hundreds of big-character posters were put up that afternoon. The Forest Survey and Design Bureau alone posted ninety-four big-character posters, raising two hundred and six opinions. By the 12th, six thousand nine hundred and sixty-eight big-character posters had been posted, raising eight thousand one hundred and sixty-one opinions. Of the sixty-four staff members in the Supply and Marketing Bureau, with the exception of one person who did not express an opinion, each person wrote an average of five big-character posters.

    The scope of the big-character posters is very broad, and almost all aspects of the issues were mentioned, but most of them focused on organizational structure, business policy, leadership style, and wages and benefits. Moreover, some of the issues raised in the big-character posters were relatively important. For example, some big-character posters criticized the separation of the Ministry of Forestry and the Ministry of Forest Industry, arguing that although the two ministries have similar businesses, the separation has the advantages of detailed division of labor, centralized management, and specialized handling, but it is easy to cause unclear entanglements in business and will inevitably lead to major shortcomings such as a huge organization and bloated staff. One big-character poster, entitled "What Does the Separation of the Two Ministries Bring?", analyzed: "The work efficiency has not been much higher than before the separation, and the business work has not been completed better than before, but a new set of institutions has been set up, and the number of personnel has increased by more than two-thirds." Other big-character posters criticized the ministries for failing to resolve some major issues for a long time, often "studying and researching, discussing and discussing." As a result, the relationship between infrastructure construction and production, the advantages and disadvantages of water transport and land transport, the afforestation policy, and the handling of conflicts between afforestation and logging could not be resolved in a timely manner. Dozens of big-character posters in the Forest Survey Bureau debated the organizational structure and overstaffing. Some advocated reducing the staff by one-half, some advocated reducing it by four-fifths, and some advocated reducing it by three-quarters. Some big-character posters also criticized waste: one big-character poster exposed the fact that the Personnel Department's Dajuesi Sanatorium privately used 150,000 yuan of the enterprise bonus fund, but it did not work. A young man simply took two very thick foreign timber samples with diameters of 0.5 meters and 0.4 meters that had been exposed to the wind and sun for two years and no one had paid attention to, drew crying faces on them, wrote self-narrating poems, and moved them to the square in front of the gate to show the public. One big-character poster demanded that the ministry change the chaotic phenomenon of "planning in the same year, designing in the same year, preparing in the same year, constructing in the same year, and producing in the same year" in terms of infrastructure construction, so as to avoid major losses and waste of state funds due to rushing tasks. Another big-character poster criticized Vice Minister Luo Yuanchuan for promising a certain unit in Shenyang 40,000 cubic meters of timber during a business trip to the Northeast, which did not comply with the state allocation procedures. Comrade Luo Yuanchuan immediately wrote a big-character poster to make a self-criticism and thanked the person who raised the opinion. The General Office also tried its best to respond to and resolve the issues raised in the big-character posters.

    Another important form of airing views in the Ministry of Forestry and the Ministry of Forest Industry was to hold various types of symposiums. Because some people were unwilling to write big-character posters, they were willing to speak freely at symposiums. In the past few days, due to the use of this form, about 10,000 opinions have been put forward successively.

    In order to make the airing of views more thorough and universal, the leadership also criticized and corrected some leading cadres who were not effective in leading the movement. They criticized the negative attitude of some cadres who would only make self-criticisms after being exposed.

    Currently, the Ministry of Forestry and the Ministry of Forest Industry have entered the climax of special debates and comprehensive rectification.

### 林业森工两部进入整改高潮  大字报五彩缤纷，“三害”现象揭露不少

    林业森工两部进入整改高潮
    大字报五彩缤纷，“三害”现象揭露不少
    本报讯　林业、森工两部的整风运动进入整改为主的第三阶段之后，发展得非常快。10月30日上午罗玉川副部长总结了前五个月反右派斗争，同时进行了整改动员报告，群众情绪非常高涨，当天下午就贴出了数百张大字报。仅森林调查设计局一个小单位，即贴出大字报九十四张，提出二百零六条意见。到12日为止，已贴出大字报六千九百六十八张，提出意见八千一百六十一条。供销局的六十四名工作人员中，除一人未表示态度外，平均每人写了五张大字报。
    大字报涉及的面很广，几乎各方面的问题都提到了，但多数集中在机构体制、业务方针、领导作风及工资福利等几个方面。而且有的大字报提出的问题也比较重要。如有的大字报批评了林业、森工两部分家的问题，认为林业、森工两部业务相近，分家虽然有分工细、管理集中、专业专办的好处，但业务上容易发生牵扯不清的现象，一定要形成机构庞大、人员臃肿等重大缺点。有一张大字报以“两部分家带来些什么”为题分析说：“分部后工作效率并未比前提高多少，业务工作并未完成得比前更好，可是机构却另设了一套，人员却增加了三分之二以上”。还有的大字报批评部里对有些重大问题长期不能解决。经常“研究研究、讨论讨论”。结果是：基建与生产的关系问题、水运与陆运的利害问题、绿化方针问题、造林与采伐之间矛盾的处理问题等等，都不能及时解决。森调局有数十张大字报争论机构体制及人浮于事问题，有的主张精减二分之一，有的主张减五分之四，有的主张减四分之三。有些大字报还批评了浪费现象：一张大字报揭发了人事司的大觉寺休养所私自动用了企奖基金十五万元，反而未起作用的事实。一个青年索性将风吹日晒两年无人过问的零点五米和零点四米的两根直径很粗的外国成材取样，画上哭脸，写上自诉诗，搬到大门口广场示众。一张大字报要求部里改变基建方面“当年计划，当年设计，当年准备，当年施工，当年生产”的忙乱现象，以免因赶任务而造成重大的损失，浪费了国家资金。还有一张大字报批评了副部长罗玉川，有一次出差到东北答应给沈阳某单位四万立方公尺木材，不符合国家调拨手续。罗玉川同志立即写大字报作了检讨，并对提意见的人致谢。办公厅对大字报所提出来的问题也尽力作了答复和解决。
    林业、森工两部鸣放的另一重要形式，是召开了多种多样的座谈会。因为有些人不愿写大字报，愿意在座谈会上畅所欲言。几天来，由于利用了这一形式，先后提出意见约有万余条。
    为了鸣放得更彻底更普遍，领导上还批评和纠正了某些领导运动不力的领导干部。批评了一些干部揭发什么就检查什么的消极态度。
    目前，林业、森工两部已经进入了专题辩论和全面整改的高潮。
