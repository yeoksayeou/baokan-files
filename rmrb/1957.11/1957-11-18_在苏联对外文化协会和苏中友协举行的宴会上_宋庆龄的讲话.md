    At a Banquet Held by the Soviet Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries and the Soviet-China Friendship Association
    Speech by Soong Ching Ling
    Dear Comrade Popova, Comrades, Brothers and Sisters:
    Please allow me, on behalf of all the Chinese comrades present, to express my heartfelt gratitude for the warm reception from the Soviet-China Friendship Association and the Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries.
    We are honored to come to our great ally, the Soviet Union, to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution together with our closest comrades and comrades-in-arms—the great Soviet people. For myself and every Chinese comrade present, this is one of the most important events that we will never forget in our lives.
    The Great October Socialist Revolution opened a new era in human history. For forty years, the great Soviet people, under the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, have overcome all hardships with unparalleled heroism and strong will, and established the world's first brilliant socialist country. The Soviet people are now victoriously transitioning to the greatest ideal of mankind—a communist society—in order to fulfill the glorious tasks put forward by the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. On October 4th this year, the Soviet Union successfully launched the first artificial earth satellite, and on November 3rd, it successfully launched the second, larger, and better-equipped artificial satellite, thus opening up a new era for mankind to further conquer nature, and was warmly cheered by people of all countries. This is the glory of the Soviet people and the common glory of the working people all over the world. The powerful Soviet Union has always been a strong fortress for defending world peace and a loyal friend of oppressed nations. The great achievements of the Soviet people in socialist construction, as well as their great contributions to world peace and the cause of human progress, are forever the greatest source of encouragement for the Chinese people and the working people all over the world.
    The Chinese people have always regarded our country's revolutionary cause as a continuation of the Great October Revolution, and are greatly honored by this. For forty years, the Soviet government and the Soviet people have consistently sympathized with and supported the Chinese people's cause of liberation. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Soviet Union has provided comprehensive and great assistance to our country's socialist construction.
    During our visit to the Soviet Union, we have personally witnessed the extremely hard work that the Soviet people have put in to help China's socialist construction. Our people will never forget this great support and assistance from our Soviet elder brother. We sincerely thank the Soviet government, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and the Soviet people for their consistent support.
    Our two countries have formed the closest alliance, and the fraternal friendship between our two peoples is constantly being consolidated and developed. During these few days in the Soviet Union, we have been immersed in an atmosphere of friendship and joy at all times, and we have felt the great strength of the great, brotherly Sino-Soviet friendship and cooperation at all times. This great friendship between our two countries is eternal and unbreakable. It is an important guarantee for maintaining world peace and the cause of human progress. The people of China and the Soviet Union deeply understand the importance of this unity and protect it as if it were their own lives. The friendship organizations of China and the Soviet Union, namely the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and the Soviet Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, have done a great deal of work for this. We believe that with the establishment of the Soviet-China Friendship Association, our joint work will surely move forward even more greatly. The great peoples of China and the Soviet Union will forever be the closest brothers and the most reliable comrades-in-arms. In the noble cause of strengthening the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, safeguarding world peace, and promoting human progress, the Chinese people will surely always unite closely with the Soviet people, unite with the people of socialist countries and the working people all over the world, and advance victoriously!
    Ladies and gentlemen, let us raise our glasses to the great achievements of the Soviet-China Friendship Association, to the victory of the great Soviet people, and to the unbreakable, brotherly Sino-Soviet friendship and cooperation!

    在苏联对外文化协会和苏中友协举行的宴会上
    宋庆龄的讲话
    亲爱的波波娃同志，同志们，兄弟姊妹们：
    请允许我代表在座的全体中国同志，对于苏联苏中友好协会和对外文化协会的热忱招待，表示衷心的感谢。
    我们这次荣幸地来到我们伟大的盟邦苏联，同我们最亲密的同志和战友——伟大的苏联人民一同欢庆伟大十月社会主义革命四十周年。这对于我自己和我们每一个在座的中国同志来说，都是毕生永远不会忘记的最重要的事件之一。
    伟大的十月社会主义革命开辟了人类历史的新纪元。四十年来，伟大的苏联人民，在苏联共产党的领导下，以无比的英雄气概和坚强意志，战胜了一切艰难困苦，建立了世界上第一个光辉灿烂的社会主义国家。苏联人民现在正在为着实现苏共第二十次代表大会所提出的光荣任务，胜利地向人类最伟大的理想——共产主义社会过渡。今年10月4日苏联成功地发射了第一个人造地球卫星，11月3日又成功地发射了第二个更大和装备得更好的人造卫星，从此就开辟了人类进一步征服自然的新纪元，受到世界各国人民的热烈欢呼。这是苏联人民的光荣，也是全世界劳动人民的共同光荣。强大的苏联一直是保卫世界和平的坚强堡垒和被压迫民族的忠实朋友，苏联人民在社会主义建设中所获得的伟大成就，以及对于世界和平和人类进步事业的伟大贡献，对于中国人民和全世界劳动人民永远是最伟大的鼓舞力量。
    中国人民一向认为我国的革命事业是伟大十月革命的继续，并且以此为莫大的光荣。四十年来，苏联政府和苏联人民一贯同情和支持中国人民的解放事业。中华人民共和国成立以后，苏联对我国的社会主义建设又给予了全面的伟大的援助。
    我们这次到苏联访问，又亲眼看到苏联人民为帮助中国社会主义建设，付出了极其辛勤的劳动。我国人民永远不会忘记苏联老大哥对于我们的这种伟大支持和援助。我们衷心感谢一贯支援我们的苏联政府、苏联共产党和苏联人民。
    我们两国已经结成了最亲密的同盟，我们两国人民间的兄弟友谊正在不断地巩固发展。我们这几天在苏联时时刻刻都浸沉在友好欢乐的气氛中，时时刻刻都感到伟大的、兄弟般的中苏友好合作的巨大力量。我们两国间的这种伟大的友谊是永恒的和牢不可破的，它是维护世界和平和人类进步事业的重要保证。我们中苏两国人民深深地懂得这种团结的重要性，并且像保护自己生命一般地来保护这种团结。中苏两国人民的友好组织即中苏友好协会和苏联对外文化协会曾经为此进行过巨大的工作。我们相信：由于苏中友好协会的成立，必将使我们的共同工作，更加大大前进。伟大的中苏两国人民永远是最亲密的兄弟和最可靠的战友。在加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结，维护世界和平和促进人类进步的崇高事业中，中国人民一定永远同苏联人民亲密地团结在一起，同社会主义各国人民以及全世界劳动人民团结在一起，胜利前进！
    请诸位，为了苏中友好协会的工作获得伟大的成就，为了伟大的苏联人民的胜利，为了牢不可破的、兄弟般的中苏友好合作，干杯！
