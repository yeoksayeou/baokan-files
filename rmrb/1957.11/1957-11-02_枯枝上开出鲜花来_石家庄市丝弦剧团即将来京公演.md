Flowers Bloom on Withered Branches
Shijiazhuang Silk String Opera Troupe to Perform in Beijing Soon

The "Silk String Opera," which has a long history of more than 400 years and is popular in the central Hebei Plain, was almost wiped out by the Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang before liberation. It was not until after liberation that this ancient opera genre was revived and bloomed into more beautiful flowers under the support of the Communist Party and the People's Government.

The "Silk String Opera" is a simple, beautiful, and healthy opera genre, full of the emotions and aspirations of the working people, with clear love and hate, and a strong sense of life. In the past few years, more than 600 traditional plays with different contents have been excavated and sorted out, with about 500 tunes. The tunes are rich in melody, expressive, and deeply rooted in the folk (locals have sayings like "nine tunes and eighteen melodies, seventy-two hums." This not only shows that there are many tunes, but also that almost everyone can sing a few lines.); "Silk String Opera" also has its unique performance skills and dance movements, which are refined, delicate and humorous, so it is deeply welcomed and loved by local audiences.

The representative troupe of "Silk String Opera" - the Shijiazhuang Silk String Opera Troupe, will meet the audience in the capital from November 16th. They have a large number of excellent actors such as Wang Yongchun, Zhang Yongjia, and Shi Lianxiu. They brought dozens of large and small plays such as "Empty Seal Box," "White Jade Cup," and "Little Sister's Dream," and the performance period in Beijing will be about one month. (Liu Lu)

    枯枝上开出鲜花来
    石家庄市丝弦剧团即将来京公演
    流行于冀中大平原，有着四百多年悠久历史的“丝弦戏”，在解放前日寇和国民党的摧残下，几乎被消灭掉。直到解放后，这个古老的剧种才在共产党和人民政府的扶植下，得到了复苏，而且开放出更鲜艳的花朵来。
    “丝弦戏”是一个纯朴、优美而又健康的剧种，处处洋溢着劳动人民的情感和愿望，爱憎分明，生活气息浓厚。几年来已经挖掘整理出来的不同内容的传统剧目有六百多出，约有五百多支曲牌。曲牌的曲调丰富，表现力强，深入民间（当地人有‘九腔十八调’，七十二哼哼之说。这不但说明曲牌多，而且差不多的人都会唱几句。）；“丝弦戏”更有它独特的表演技巧和舞蹈动作，洗炼、细腻而又有风趣，所以深受当地观众的欢迎和热爱。
    “丝弦戏”的代表剧团——石家庄市丝弦剧团，11月16日起就要在首都和观众见面了。他们拥有大批优秀的演员如王永春、张永甲、石连秀等，他们带来了“空印盒”“白玉杯”“小二姐做梦”等几十出大小剧目，在京演期将为一个月左右。　（刘路）
