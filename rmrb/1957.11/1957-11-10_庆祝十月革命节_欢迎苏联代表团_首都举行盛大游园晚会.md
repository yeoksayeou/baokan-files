Xinhua News Agency, 9th. Over 20,000 people from all walks of life in Beijing held a grand garden party in Zhongshan Park tonight to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution and to welcome the Soviet delegation, headed by Comrade Andreyev, to participate in the Chinese people's celebration of the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution.

Tonight, tens of thousands of colorful lanterns shone brightly among the ancient cypress trees in Zhongshan Park. Countless red gauze palace lanterns hung on the eaves of the vermilion ancient buildings, transforming the entire park into a joyous palace that never sleeps. On all the paths in the park, chrysanthemums were in full bloom, and crowds welcoming the distinguished guests lined up from the Jinshui Bridge to the front of Zhongshan Hall.

Premier Zhou Enlai attended tonight's party.

At 7:00 PM, Head of Delegation Andreyev and all members of the delegation, accompanied by Soviet Embassy Chargé d'Affaires ad interim G.A. Goutyrev and Mayor Peng Zhen, arrived at Zhongshan Park. Immediately, warm and sustained applause erupted from the welcoming crowds, and the band played "Moscow-Beijing," a song praising the great friendship between China and the Soviet Union. The Soviet guests waved to the enthusiastic welcoming masses, and together with Chinese workers, students, and youth of all ethnic groups, sang "Moscow-Beijing" in time with the music.

Mayor Peng Zhen delivered a speech at the party on behalf of the city of Beijing and the Chinese people, warmly welcoming the Soviet delegation from all walks of life. He pointed out in his speech that the brilliant achievements of the Soviet Union in building socialism and communism are a model for China's socialist construction. He also expressed heartfelt gratitude for the comprehensive and selfless assistance provided by the Soviet government and people to China's construction.

Head of Delegation Andreyev then spoke at the party. He said that the significance of the October Revolution, as pointed out by the great Lenin, has been proven by the victory of the socialist revolution in China and many other countries. No force in the world can stop humanity from further advancing on the path of the October Revolution.

Also invited to participate in the garden party were other Soviet and foreign delegations currently visiting China, Soviet experts in Beijing, experts from various people's democratic countries, and experts from India, Indonesia, and Egypt.

Diplomatic envoys from various countries to China were also invited to attend the party.

Also participating in the party were He Long, Chen Yi, Nie Rongzhen, Li Jishen, Luo Ronghuan, Huang Yanpei, Chen Shutong, Zhang Dingcheng, Bao Erhan, Zhang Wentian, and Wu Yuzhang, among others.

After the welcoming ceremony, colorful fireworks were set off in front of Zhongshan Hall and on both sides of the Altar of Land and Grain. Some resembled dragons darting wildly, while others resembled fountains cascading down. In an instant, slogans such as "Long Live Sino-Soviet Friendship!" and "Long Live World Peace!" were displayed in the sky.

Subsequently, Head of Delegation Andreyev and other Soviet guests passed through the welcoming crowds and arrived at the bank of the Back River. Two thousand colorful river lanterns floated on the water. Mayor Peng Zhen told Head of Delegation Andreyev that this was a traditional Chinese custom, and river lanterns are usually released during major festivals. Andreyev repeatedly praised the colorful lanterns covering the river, comparing them to blooming lotus flowers. At this time, Soviet Old Bolshevik Kislenko met Vice Premier He Long and immediately stepped forward to shake hands and exchange greetings.

The guests entered the ancient cypress grove on the bank of the river, where a small screen displayed an interesting scene of a tortoise and a crane fighting. After watching the shadow puppet play performed by the Hunan Puppet Shadow Art Troupe, the guests went backstage to shake hands with and thank Tan Degui and other veteran shadow puppet actors with thirty years of experience. Tan Degui introduced the performance methods of shadow puppetry to the guests, and Head of Delegation Andreyev said that he would take their performance experience back to Moscow.

On the stage west of the path, twelve actresses who had recently returned from Moscow performed the Dai ethnic folk dance "Peacock Dance" for the guests. They had won gold medals at the 6th World Festival of Youth and Students in Moscow.

In the dance circle of Peking University in front of Zhongshan Hall, students performed the Ukrainian folk dance "Utyosky," which they had just rehearsed to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution, for the Soviet guests. The students also put flower garlands on three Soviet experts and enthusiastically invited them to dance. Soon, two Egyptian experts also joined the dance circle and danced gracefully to the music.

Around 10:00 PM, the China Puppet Art Troupe, which had performed for Chairman Voroshilov here on "May Fourth" this year, performed the Chinese folk song and dance "Little Cowherd" for the Soviet guests. Soviet experts Kuchava and Baliyev watched the puppet play "The Chameleon," adapted from Chekhov's short story "The Chameleon," and repeatedly praised it, saying that the characters in Chekhov's novel were completely portrayed. At the performance venue north of Laijin Yuxuan, Head of Delegation Andreyev and other Soviet guests also watched the "Ukrainian Dance," which the Beijing Dance School had rehearsed with the help of Soviet expert Leshevich.

The party, filled with joy and fraternal friendship, continued until 11:00 PM. (Attached Photo)

    庆祝十月革命节　欢迎苏联代表团
    首都举行盛大游园晚会
    新华社9日讯　北京各界人民两万多人今晚在中山公园举行盛大的游园晚会，庆祝十月革命四十周年，并欢迎以安德烈耶夫为首的苏联参加中国人民庆祝十月革命四十周年纪念代表团。
    今天晚上，中山公园里的古柏丛中万盏彩灯光芒四射，朱红色古代建筑的飞檐上悬挂着无数个红纱宫灯，整个公园变成了一座欢乐的不夜之宫。在公园的所有甬道上，菊花盛开，夹道欢迎贵宾的人群，从金水桥上一直排到中山堂前。
    周恩来总理出席了今天的晚会。
    七时整，安德烈耶夫团长和代表团全体团员以及苏联驻中国大使馆临时代办顾悌克夫由彭真市长陪同来到中山公园，夹道欢迎的人群中立刻响起经久不息的热烈掌声，乐队奏起了歌颂中苏伟大友谊的“莫斯科—北京”。苏联贵宾们一面频频向热情的欢迎群众挥手致意，一面和中国工人、学生和各族青年们一起，和着乐曲的节拍同唱“莫斯科—北京”。
    彭真市长在晚会上代表北京市和中国人民热情欢迎苏联各界代表团的光临。他在讲话中指出，苏联建设社会主义和共产主义的辉煌成绩就是中国建设社会主义的榜样。他并对苏联政府和人民给予中国建设的全面无私援助表示衷心地感谢。
    安德烈耶夫团长接着在晚会上讲话。他说，伟大的列宁所指出的十月革命的意义已为中国和许多其他国家社会主义革命的胜利所证明，世界上没有任何力量能阻挡人类进一步向十月革命道路前进。
    应邀参加游园晚会的，还有现在北京的苏联和其他国家在中国访问的其他代表团，在北京的苏联专家、各人民民主国家的专家和印度、印度尼西亚和埃及的专家。
    各国驻中国使节也应邀出席晚会。
    参加晚会的，还有贺龙、陈毅、聂荣臻、李济深、罗荣桓、黄炎培、陈叔通、张鼎丞、包尔汉、张闻天和吴玉章等人。
    欢迎仪式结束后，在中山堂前和社稷坛东西两侧，五彩缤纷的焰火齐放。有的像火龙乱窜，有的像喷泉倾泻。刹那间，在半空中放出了“中苏友好万岁！”“世界和平万岁！”的标语。
    随后，安德烈耶夫团长和其他苏联贵宾们穿过夹道欢迎的人群，来到了后河岸上，河面上两千盏五彩河灯随微波漂动。彭真市长告诉安德烈耶夫团长说，这是中国民间的传统习惯，每逢盛大节日照例要放河灯。安德烈耶夫连声称赞满河的彩灯像是盛开的莲花。这时，苏联老布尔什维克基斯连科遇到了贺龙副总理，立刻上前相互握手问候。
    客人们走进河岸上的古柏林里，一个小小的银幕上出现了龟鹤相斗的有趣场面。客人们看完湖南木偶皮影艺术团表演的这场皮影戏后还到后台向三十年的皮影老演员谭德贵等握手道谢，谭德贵向贵宾介绍了皮影戏的表演方法，安德烈耶夫团长说要把他们的表演经验带到莫斯科去。
    甬道西面的舞台上，不久前才从莫斯科归来的十二位女演员，给贵宾们表演了傣族民间舞蹈“孔雀舞”，她们在莫斯科举行的第六届青年联欢节上获得了金质奖章。
    在中山堂前北京大学的舞圈里，学生们给苏联客人表演了庆祝十月革命四十周年刚排练的乌克兰民间舞蹈“乌秋斯基”。学生们还给三位苏联专家戴上花环，热情地邀请他们跳交谊舞。不久，两个埃及专家也挤进舞圈，在音乐声中翩翩起舞。
    十时许，今年“五四”就在这里给伏罗希洛夫主席演出过的中国木偶艺术剧团，今天又给苏联贵宾们演出了中国民间歌舞
  “小放牛”。苏联专家顾恰瓦和巴里?夫观看了根据契呵夫的短篇小说“变色龙”改编的木偶剧“石龙子”后连声称赞，说是契呵夫小说中的人物形象完全表现出来了。在来今雨轩北面的演出场上，安德烈耶夫团长和其他苏联贵宾，还观看了由苏联专家列舍维奇帮助北京舞蹈学校排练过的“乌克兰舞”。
    充满了欢乐与兄弟友谊的晚会一直进行到夜间十一时。（附图片）
