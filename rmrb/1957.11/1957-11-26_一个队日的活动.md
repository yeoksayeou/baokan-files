　　A group of Young Pioneers from the Primary School Attached to Peking University stood on the Jinshui Bridge, looking up at the majestic Tiananmen. “Look! The cannonballs of the Anglo-French Allied Forces hit right here,” one of the members pointed to the slogan “Long Live the Great Unity of the People of the World” on the right wall of Tiananmen. “Teacher Dong, where did the golden phoenix used by the emperor to issue decrees come down from?” The teacher opened a book and pointed to the picture of the Golden Phoenix Issuing a Decree: "Look, it came down from the merlon right in the middle." This was the third squadron continuing their squadron meeting by taking advantage of a trip to the Forbidden City.

　　Although these children have grown up in Beijing since they were little, they know very little about this lovely and great hometown. Based on this situation, the squadron committee decided to hold a squadron meeting with the theme of "Beijing - A Lovely Capital" to give the members patriotic education. All members of the squadron devoted themselves to the preparatory work. The squadron also specially invited Uncle Hou Renzhi, a professor of the Department of Geology and Geography who was familiar with Beijing, to tell the children about the past and future of Beijing. Some members practiced reciting "Ode to Beijing." Many children also found a lot of information about Beijing from pictorials, and collected photos and maps to set up a small exhibition.

　　One sunny afternoon, the team meeting began in the sound of drums. Uncle Hou gave everyone a detailed introduction to the history of Tiananmen and a lot of knowledge about Beijing. The children listened quietly, and pictures appeared in their minds: how the hard-working and intelligent people built this magnificent Beijing. What excited the children most was that they learned about Beijing's development prospects – Beijing will not only be a political and cultural center, but will also become a production center in the future.

　　They had all been to Tiananmen, but today they were particularly excited and felt especially close. The children stood on the Jinshui Bridge and looked back. They saw the Monument to the People's Heroes standing in the square. The children silently thought: It was the blood of the martyrs that washed away the throne of the feudal emperors and brought a new Beijing to the people.

    一个队日的活动	振羽
    北京大学附小一群少先队员，站在金水桥上，仰望着天安门的雄姿。“你看！英法联军的炮弹就打在这里。”一个队员指着天安门右城墙上“世界人民大团结万岁”的标语说道。“董老师，皇帝下命令用的金凤凰从哪里下来的？”老师打开一本书，指着金凤颁诏图：“你们看，就从这正中间的垛口下来的。”这是第三中队利用旅行故宫的机会，在继续进行他们的中队会。
    这些孩子虽然从小就生长在北京，可是对这可爱而又伟大的故乡，却很少了解。中队委员会根据这一情况，决定搞一个以“北京——可爱的首都”为主题的队会，使队员得到爱国主义教育。全中队的队员都投入了准备工作，中队还特地请了熟识北京的地质地理系教授侯仁之伯伯给孩子们讲北京的过去和未来，一部分队员在练习朗诵“北京颂”。还有不少孩子从画报上找到许多有关北京的资料，搜集了照片、地图，布置了一个小型展览会。
    一个晴朗的下午，队会在鼓声中开始了。侯伯伯给大家详细介绍了天安门的历史；和许多有关北京的知识。孩子们静静地倾听着，在他们的脑海中浮现出一幅幅图画：勤劳智慧的人民怎样建造这雄伟的北京，最使孩子们兴奋的是他们知道了北京建设远景——北京不仅是政治和文化中心，将来还要变成一个生产中心。
    他们都到过天安门，可是今天他们特别兴奋，又感到格外亲切。孩子们站在金水桥上回头一看，只见人民英雄纪念碑矗立在广场上，孩子们默默地想着：是烈士们的鲜血冲毁了封建帝王的宝座，换来了人民新生的北京。
