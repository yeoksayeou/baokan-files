Recalling the Great and Selfless Assistance of the Soviet Union
He Xiangning

Forty years ago, the sound of the October Revolution shook the world. Oppressed countries and nations around the world were incomparably inspired by the October Revolution. The support given by the world's first socialist country, the Soviet Union, to the national independence movements of oppressed nations, ushered in a new historical era for the national independence movements of oppressed nations around the world.

The October Revolution gave a tremendous impetus to the Chinese revolution. With the October Revolution, the Chinese revolution began its new era.

Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Xinhai Revolution overthrew the Qing dynasty. Lenin had a very high evaluation of Dr. Sun Yat-sen. From the Xinhai Revolution to the October Revolution, every attempt at a democratic revolution against imperialism and against feudal warlords ended in counter-revolutionary military coups by feudal bureaucrats and warlords, preventing the success of the Chinese democratic revolution. The victory of the October Revolution and the establishment of the Chinese Communist Party brought a new era of dawn to the Chinese revolution. Marxism-Leninism spread among the Chinese people and took root. At that time, revolution was no longer a military conspiracy; it had become a mass action of conscious people under the leadership of a revolutionary party with a clear revolutionary program. It was precisely for this reason that Dr. Sun Yat-sen said to a group of old counter-revolutionaries who opposed alliance with the Soviet Union and the Communists: "I am going to reorganize the Kuomintang. If you are all unwilling, you can all withdraw, and I will join the Communist Party alone."

After the October Revolution, under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Chinese people defeated the forces of imperialism and the domestic feudal warlord forces, and finally established the People's Republic of China. For more than thirty years, the Soviet Union's selfless assistance to us has been uninterrupted. Shortly after the success of the October Revolution, the Soviet Union announced the abolition of the unequal treaties concluded by the Tsarist Russian government with the Qing government, and took the initiative to lift the shackles imposed on the Chinese people by the Tsarist Russian era. How excited and grateful we Chinese people were! When Dr. Sun Yat-sen decided on the three major policies of alliance with the Soviet Union, alliance with the Communists, and assistance to peasants and workers in 1923, the unconditional and generous help given to us by the Soviet Union was enormous. At that time, many contacts were made by Liao Zhongkai. The Soviet Union helped us oppose imperialism and warlords, and also sent advisors and military experts, enabling Dr. Sun Yat-sen to carry out various tasks in the difficult environment at that time, establish revolutionary armed forces, and ensure the success and victory of the Northern Expedition. Members of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang and some people from various democratic parties should be familiar with the history of this period. Even during the more than twenty years of the rule of the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries, the Soviet people never stopped encouraging and supporting the Chinese people. Although at one time, the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary regime once declared the severance of diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics was still the ideal beacon in the minds of the broad masses of Chinese working people and democratic people from all walks of life, and it still illuminated the path of the broad masses of Chinese people in their struggle for independence, democracy, and freedom. During the Anti-Japanese War, in order to help the Chinese people win victory, many Soviet friends even shed their last drop of blood and gloriously sacrificed their lives, which is truly grateful. As for the Soviet Union's assistance to us after the founding of the People's Republic of China, it is well known. The Soviet Union was the first to recognize our People's Republic of China. In February 1950, it signed the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance with our country. According to this treaty, it helped us carry out various restoration and construction works. In October 1954, a delegation of the Soviet government headed by Comrade Khrushchev visited China and held talks with our national leaders, issuing the "Joint Communiqué between China and the Soviet Union on the Withdrawal of Soviet Troops from the Jointly Used Chinese Lushun Port Naval Base and the Handover of the Base to the Complete Control of the People's Republic of China" and the "Joint Communiqué between China and the Soviet Union on the Transfer of Soviet Shares in Various Joint-Stock Companies to the People's Republic of China," etc., donating a lot of equipment and materials to our country free of charge. As for the cooperation between China and the Soviet Union in science and technology, such as sending experts, donating machinery and equipment, and helping our Red Cross hospitals, etc., the human and material assistance is even countless. During our country's first five-year plan period, the economic and technical assistance provided by the Soviet government to our country was extremely important for our country's construction cause. Without the Soviet Union's selfless assistance, it would be difficult for our country's industry, agriculture, and various constructions to have such rapid and great achievements today. It is absolutely impossible to expect capitalist and imperialist countries to help us selflessly in this way, except for the socialist Soviet Union. Imperialist countries only invade us and do not help us build. History is clear evidence. More than thirty years ago, Dr. Sun Yat-sen had already foreseen this, so in 1923 he unhesitatingly chose the path of "alliance with the Soviet Union" and "taking Russia as a teacher." The Soviet Union's assistance to us is an undeniable fact for more than thirty years. Only bourgeois rightists who close their eyes and refuse to face the current reality and historical events will echo imperialism and shamelessly slander the great Sino-Soviet friendship. The rightists openly slander the Soviet Union, provoke Sino-Soviet relations, and oppose the friendly Sino-Soviet foreign policy, which is simply absurd. I am eighty years old. I should state that the Soviet Union's brotherly friendship and selfless assistance to our country for more than thirty years are historical facts that I have personally witnessed and directly felt, and I am willing to testify to the people of the whole country. We are extremely grateful for the Soviet Union's consistent support and assistance to us. Now that the rightists have actually uttered these fallacies of repaying kindness with ingratitude, I feel very indignant. It is not difficult to see that the rightists disregard historical facts, are mad with ambition, and distort the truth, but they have ulterior motives.

As Chairman Mao said: "The full understanding and deep friendship established on the basis of the fundamental interests of the people of China and the Soviet Union are difficult to describe in words. ... The unity of the people of China and the Soviet Union will be permanent, indestructible, and no one can separate it." The long-tested Sino-Soviet friendship will not only not be weakened, but will become more and more consolidated. Sino-Soviet friendship is also determined by the geographical relationship between the two countries. China and the Soviet Union are adjacent, spanning Europe and Asia, covering frigid, temperate, and subtropical zones, with a total population of more than 800 million, and rich underground metal resources. The Soviet Union also has excellent and advanced scientific and technological talents. If our two peoples unite together, work hard in production, and use the abundant underground mineral resources and abundant agricultural harvests to provide raw materials for the development of heavy industry and light industry, helping each other, not only will the people's lives be improved and the country will be prosperous and strong, but it will also be possible to save the oppressed nations from the depths of misery, promote human progress, and defend world peace.

The recent successful launch of the artificial earth satellite by the Soviet Union has brought the ideal of mankind exploring the secrets of nature outside the earth closer to realization after many years. We Chinese people warmly congratulate the Soviet scientists and the Soviet people on the great scientific achievement of successfully launching an artificial earth satellite on the eve of the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution with unparalleled excitement, and congratulate the Soviet people on this contribution of extremely great significance to the cause of world peace.

Long live the great 40th anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution!

    回忆苏联伟大无私的援助
    何香凝
    四十年前，十月革命的炮声震动了全世界。世界上被压迫国家和民族，都受到了十月革命的无可比拟的鼓舞。世界上第一个社会主义国家——苏联对被压迫民族独立运动所给予的支持，使世界上被压迫的民族独立运动走上了新的历史时代。
    十月革命给中国革命以极大的推动。有了十月革命，中国革命才开始了它的新纪元。
    孙中山先生领导的辛亥革命推翻了清朝皇室。列宁对孙中山先生有过极高的评价。辛亥革命以来到十月革命这一段期间，每一个反对帝国主义，反对封建军阀的民主主义革命的尝试，都是以封建官僚和军阀的反革命军事政变而告终，使中国的民主革命运动并没有成功。十月革命的胜利，和中国共产党的成立，给中国革命带来了新的黎明时代。马克思列宁主义在中国人民中传开了，并且生了根。那个时候，革命不再是军事阴谋了，革命已经成为具有自觉的人民在具有明确革命纲领的革命政党领导之下的群众性行动。正因为如此，孙中山先生对一群反对联苏、联共的老反革命说：“我就是要改组国民党。如果你们都不愿意，你们都可以退出，我一个人加入共产党。”
    十月革命以后，中国人民在共产党的领导下，战胜了帝国主义势力，和国内的封建军阀势力，终于成立了中华人民共和国。三十多年来，苏联对我们的无私帮助，一直没有间断。在十月革命成功之后不久，苏联就宣布取消帝俄时代与清朝政府所订立的不平等条约，首先自动解除帝俄时代所加于中国人民的束缚。我们中国人民是多么兴奋感谢啊！当孙中山先生在1923年决定联苏、联共、扶助农工的三大政策之时，苏联所给予我们的无条件的、慷慨的帮助就很大。当时很多是由廖仲恺接头的。苏联帮助我们反对帝国主义，反对军阀，还派来了顾问，派来了军事专家，使孙中山先生能够在当时的困难环境中进行各项工作，建立了革命武装，保证了北伐的成功和胜利。民革成员及各民主党派的一部分人士，应该熟悉这段时期的历史。就是在蒋介石反动集团统治中国的二十多年中，苏联人民也没有停止过对中国人民的鼓励和支持。尽管有一个时期，蒋介石反动统治曾一度向苏联宣布断绝邦交，但是苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟，仍然是中国广大劳动人民和各界民主人士的理想中的明灯，仍然照耀着广大中国人民为争取独立、民主和自由而斗争的道路。在抗日战争期间，为了帮助中国人民争取胜利，有不少的苏联朋友甚至流尽了最后一滴血，光荣的牺牲了自己的生命，实在令人感激。至于在中华人民共和国成立以后，苏联对我们的帮助，更是尽人皆知的了。苏联首先承认我们中华人民共和国。1950年2月，又和我国订立了中苏友好同盟互助条约。根据这个条约，帮助我们进行各项恢复和建设工作。1954年10月，以赫鲁晓夫同志为首的苏联政府代 表团访问中国，与我国国家领导人进行会谈，发表了
  “中苏关于苏联军队自共同使用的中国旅顺口海军根据地撤退并将该根据地交由中华人民共和国完全支配的联合公报”和“中苏关于将各股份公司中的苏联股份移交给中华人民共和国的联合公报”等等，把很多装备和物资无偿地送给我国。至于中苏两国在科学技术上的合作，诸如派遣专家、赠送机器设备和帮助我们红十字医院等等人力物力的帮助，就更数不胜数了。在我国第一个五年计划期间，苏联政府给予我国的经济和技术的援助，对我国的建设事业来说，是极其重要的。如果没有苏联这种大公无私的援助，我国的工农业及各项建设就很难有今日这样迅速、这样伟大的成就。这种援助，除了社会主义的苏联之外，要想资本主义、帝国主义的国家也这样无私地帮助我们，是绝对不可能的。帝国主义国家只是侵略我们而不是帮助我们建设。历史就是明证。三十多年以前，孙中山先生就已预见到这一点，所以在1923年毫不犹疑地选择了“联合苏联”、“以俄为师”的道路。苏联对我们的帮助，是三十多年来不容否认的事实。只有睁眼不愿正视当前现实和历史事迹的资产阶级右派分子才会附和帝国主义，才会对伟大的中苏友谊进行无耻的污蔑。右派分子公开诋毁苏联，挑拨中苏关系，反对中苏友好的外交政策，简直是荒谬绝伦。我年已八十岁了。我应该说明：三十多年来苏联对我国有如兄弟的情谊和大公无私的帮助，是我亲眼看见和直接感触到的历史事实，我愿意对全国人民作见证。苏联一贯对我们的支持和帮助，我们是万分感激的。现在右派分子居然说出这些以怨报德的谬论，我感到十分愤激。不难看出，右派分子无视历史事实，丧心病狂，颠倒黑白，不过是别有用心而已。
    正如毛主席所说：“在中苏两大国人民根本利益的基础上所建立起来的充分的了解与深厚友谊，是难以用言语来形容的。……中苏两大国人民的团结将是永久的，不可破坏的，没有人能够分离的。”久经锻炼的中苏友谊非但绝对不会削弱，反而是愈来愈巩固了。中苏友好也决定于两国的地理关系。中苏两国相邻，地跨欧亚两洲，幅员遍及寒带、温带和亚热带，人口共有八亿多，地下金属资源丰富，苏联又有优秀的先进的科学技术人才。如果我们两国人民共同团结，努力劳动生产，以充满地下的丰富矿产资源和农业的丰盛收获，为发展重工业、轻工业提供原料，这样互助互济，不仅人民生活得以提高，国家得以繁荣富强，还更可以拯救被压迫民族于水深火热之中，促进人类进步和保卫世界和平。
    最近苏联发射人造地球卫星的成功，使多少年来人类为探求地球以外大自然的秘密的理想得以接近于实现。我们中国人民都以无比兴奋的心情热烈祝贺苏联科学家和苏联人民在十月革命四十周年前夕发射人造地球卫星成功的伟大科学成就，祝贺苏联人民这个对世界和平事业具有极其重大意义的贡献。
    伟大的十月社会主义革命四十周年万岁！
