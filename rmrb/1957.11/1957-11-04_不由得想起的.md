Last autumn, I had the opportunity to visit our newly built jet aircraft factory and attend the test flight ceremony. At the time, there were no fewer than ten million people present, but they all had one thing in mind: amazement at the speed and magnitude of our country's construction achievements. Manufacturing airplanes! And jet planes at that! Our glorious ancestors could only yearn for it in myths and realize it in some so-called cloud-riding novels. Soaring through the sky, what a heroic and magnificent undertaking!

Thinking back to the years of suffering for our nation, the airplanes of Japanese imperialism, though terribly backward by today's jet age standards, inflicted extremely painful wounds on our nation, especially because these things were in the hands of murderers who did their best to destroy the innocent. At that time, how much the people longed for our own airplanes! I clearly remember that even some boasting by the Kuomintang air force at the time would leave an impression on the people's minds.

The Kuomintang inherited the mantle of Japanese imperialism, and American imperialism exploited it even further, using its scientific achievements to sow indelible sins in our country and on the land of Korea with airplanes. When we sometimes suffered its wild bombings and indiscriminate strafing in the battlefield, in air raid shelters, or in the wild, we couldn't help but think: one day we will "repay tooth for tooth, eye for eye!"

The October Revolution was the first cry against the entire capitalist system, no, against all the systems of enslavement and exploitation that had weighed on humanity for centuries: "Repay tooth for tooth! Eye for eye!" From then on, the world was completely changed. The first society without exploitation or oppression appeared on one-sixth of the world's land, and its influence extended far beyond that one-sixth, reaching all lands. The successful launch of the Soviet artificial satellite shows that this cry will influence the stars and further conquer them.

The future is indeed very bright, and the future certainly belongs to the seeds sown, the flowers bloomed, and the fruits borne by the October Revolution.

Is it because the people of the Russian land where the October Revolution originated are particularly intelligent? Not entirely, but because their Party, their leader—Lenin—deeply studied Marxism, deeply explored the Russian workers' movement, and combined the two, which resulted in the October Revolution, which made the Russians particularly intelligent.

The Chinese people have always been known for their diligence, courage, and intelligence. When Europe did not yet have gunpowder, our ancestors invented gunpowder. Since the founding of New China, due to the excavation of the national heritage, it has been discovered that our ancestors' achievements in philosophy, politics, culture, art, and science were no less than those of any Western country. However, our country was still backward, even more backward than Tsarist Russia. Our past sages had done many things to make our country prosperous, including many revolutions, but even a large-scale revolution like the Taiping Rebellion still did not save our nation from long-term falling under foreign rule and long-term exploitation under the feudal system. Although Sun Yat-sen discovered on his deathbed that the Chinese revolution should take the Russian revolution as its teacher, his health made it impossible for him to fulfill his great aspirations.

Only the Chinese Communist Party and its Central Committee, and its leader Comrade Mao Zedong, accepted Marxism from the beginning, accepted the spirit and experience of the Russian Revolution, and established the Chinese Communist Party according to the Russian experience, which changed the face of China and made the Chinese people particularly intelligent. Therefore, using jet planes in the air to "repay tooth for tooth, eye for eye" has changed from fantasy in myths and novels to reality.

However, when one calculates the time, from the October Revolution in Russia, it is only forty years. Forty years has surpassed the achievements of thousands of years of feudalism and hundreds of years of capitalism. And don't forget: this is precisely the former Tsarist Russia and the so-called "sick man of East Asia," China. Only from here can one deeply appreciate the practical significance of what Chairman Mao said, "The Chinese people have stood up," what an inspiring sentence! And this is precisely because of the October Revolution, the Russian people stood up first, the Russian people took the lead.

At first glance, the jet factory really looks like a children's toy factory, drawing, cutting, shaving, splicing, and piecing together small pieces, it's really exquisite and delicate. At first glance, how can you believe that it can go into the air, at such supersonic speed, and also fight the enemy, but when you go to the assembly workshop and the storage workshop, and see the air force aircraft formations lined up like in an airport, you have to believe that these small pieces of drawing, cutting, shaving, and splicing that look like children's toys, its final result is the jet fighter, its performance exceeds that of the United States, and also exceeds the jets we used a few years ago in the skies over Korea to "repay tooth for tooth, eye for eye" against the American imperialist airplanes. No wonder the air force soldiers who were ordered to fly to Beijing for review were so excited that they stroked them again and again. They said: this symbolizes the great and bright socialist construction of the motherland, symbolizes our great century, marks the creative achievements of our working class, and marks the unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people.

You can look at those workers, they are all very ordinary people, but with the help of Soviet experts, they quickly and proficiently mastered this complex and sophisticated technology. A young soldier in the Anti-Japanese War was sent to aviation school to study after the national liberation. After the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, he went to a senior aviation mechanical school to study, and then went to the air force to work as a mechanical director. Later, he went to study again. Unexpectedly, last year when I visited the sister factory of this jet aircraft factory—the engine factory—I discovered that he was already working as a workshop director in this factory. In 1942, he was a veritable young soldier, thirteen years old, illiterate, having just come to the army from the grazing pastures. Last year, 1956, only fourteen years apart, his age was only twenty-seven years old, but he had already learned calculus in mathematics, and was working as a competent and satisfactory workshop director.

What enabled a shepherd to learn and master such high technology? Answer: the October Revolution, Lenin! The Chinese Communist Party, Mao Zedong!

Thousands upon thousands of people like this shepherd have not only become manufacturers of jet planes and other things, but also users, drivers, and inventors, and more importantly, they have also become soldiers who "repay tooth for tooth, eye for eye," and have become particularly intelligent.

There is an ancient Chinese saying, "When drinking water, think of the source," which means not to forget one's roots. The Chinese people have today, able to stand up on their own land, and be hailed as an indispensable decisive force in solving world problems. They will first think of the October Revolution. The October Revolution brought proletarian revolution to China, and this revolution determined the infinite happiness of the Chinese people for thousands of generations.

Yes, in order to complete this revolution, the Chinese people shed a lot of blood and sacrificed many heroes and geniuses, but now these heroes and geniuses are smiling in the afterlife, because their blood was not shed in vain, and there are more heroes and greater geniuses who inherit their legacy.

The diligent, brave, and intelligent Chinese people, commemorating the great fortieth anniversary of the October Revolution today, are striding forward to complete the tasks put forward by the October Revolution—socialism, communism. The rightists want to pull this wheel of history back. Not only are they politically doomed to failure, but also in science and technology, their masters—American imperialism—have already lost in the two major rounds of intercontinental missiles and artificial satellites, a complete and utter defeat!

The future world is ours!

The future world is the development of the October Revolution!

Long live the October Revolution!

The glory of the October Revolution will forever shine on the world, and will soon shine on the stars.

    不由得想起的
    陈沂
    去年秋天的一个日子，我有机会去访问了我们新建成的喷气式飞机制造厂，并且参加了试飞的典礼。当时在场的人何止千万，但都只有一颗心，就是惊叹于我们祖国建设的成就如此之迅速和巨大。制造飞机呀！而且是制造喷气式，我们光荣的祖先，只能在神话中去向往，只能在一些所谓腾云驾雾的小说中去实现。漫游天空，这是何等豪迈壮大的事业！
    想起我们民族在苦难的年代，日本帝国主义的飞机，尽管拿今天喷气式的时代来看，它已经是落后得可怕，然而它给予我们民族的伤害，则是十分惨痛的，而尤其因为这种东西掌握在杀人犯的手里，他们就尽量摧毁无辜，那时候的人民多末希望着有我们自己的飞机呀！我清楚的记得，就是当时国民党空军的一些吹牛，也会在人民的心中留下影响。
    国民党承继了日本帝国主义的衣钵，美帝国主义更大加发挥，利用了它在科学上的成就，在我们国家，在朝鲜的土地上用飞机种下了永远也不能洗尽的罪恶。当我们有时在战场，在防空洞，在野外遭受着它的狂炸、滥射的时候，心里不由得想起：终有一天我们要“以牙还牙、以眼还眼！”
    十月革命就是在对整个资本主义制度，不，对好多世纪以来就压在人类身上的一切奴役、剥削制度发出的第一个喊声：“以牙还牙！以眼还眼！”从此以后，世界就整个改观了，在全世界六分之一的土地上出现了第一个没有人剥削人、人压迫人的社会，而且它的影响所及，就远不只是六分之一的土地，而是所有的土地。苏联人造卫星的成功发射，说明这个喊声将要去影响星际，进一步征服星际。
    未来实在是光明得很，而未来一定是属于十月革命所播下的种子，所开的花，所结的果。
    是不是产生十月革命的俄国土地上的人特别聪明呢？不完全是这样，而是因为他们的党，他们的领袖——列宁，深深研究了马克思主义，深深探索了俄国的工人运动，并把两者结合起来，就产生了十月革命，就使得俄国人变得特别聪明起来。
    中国人一向也是以勤劳、勇敢、聪明著称于世的，欧洲还没有火药的时候，我们祖先就发明了火药，新中国成立以后，由于对民族遗产的挖掘，发现我们祖先在哲学、政治、文化、艺术、科学各方面的成就也是并不有逊于任何西方国家的，然而我们国家还是落后，甚至于比沙皇的俄国还落后；我们的历代先贤都曾为要使我们国家富强作过很多事，其中并有很多次的革命，但是甚至像太平天国那样规模巨大的革命，仍没有挽救我们民族长期沦陷异族和长期处在封建制度的剥削下。孙中山先生在临终时虽然发现了中国革命要以俄国革命为师，然而他的健康使他不可能完成他的伟大抱负。
    只有中国共产党和它的中央、和它的领袖毛泽东同志，一开始就接受了马克思主义，接受了俄国革命的精神和经验，并依照俄国的经验建立了中国共产党，这就使中国的土地变了样，也就使中国人变得特别聪明起来。因而在空中，用喷气式飞机去对敌人“以牙还牙、以眼还眼”，才由神话、小说中的
  幻想变成了现实。
      然而当一计算时间，从俄国十月革
  命算起，也不过才四十年，四十年超过
  了封建制度几千年的成就，超过了资本主义几百年的成就。而且不要忘记：这正是过去的沙皇的俄国和所谓东亚病夫的中国。也只有从这里才能深深体会毛主席所讲的“中国人站起来了”的实际意义，这是多末鼓舞人心的一句话呀！而这也正是因为有了十月革命，俄国人先站起来，俄国人走在前头。
    喷气式工厂，乍一看，真有如儿童玩具工厂、一小块，一小块的在那里画，切、削、拼、凑，真是精致得很，细腻得很。初看这些，你怎能会相信它可以到空中，又是那样的超音速，并且还要去和敌人战斗，可是等到你走到装配车间，存列车间，一看那俨如在机场横列的空军机群编队，你就不得不相信这些儿童玩具似的画、切、削、拼、凑的一小块，一小块，它最终的结果就是喷气式战斗机，性能超过美国，也超过前几年在朝鲜上空我们用以去对美帝侵略飞机的“以牙还牙，以眼还眼”的喷气式，难怪奉命飞到北京来受检阅的空军战士是那样的兴奋得抚摸又抚摸，他们说：这象征着伟大光明的祖国的社会主义建设，象征着我们这一伟大的世纪，标志着我们工人阶级创造性的成果，标志着中苏两国人民牢不可破的友谊。
    可以看看那些工人，也都是十分平凡的人，他们却都在苏联专家帮助之下很快地就把这种复杂精湛的技术熟练地掌握了。抗日战争中的一个小鬼，在全国解放后被送到航空学校去学习，经过抗美援朝战争，他又到高级的航空机械学校学习，以后又到空军的团队去当机械主任，以后又去学习，想不到去年我在参观这个喷气式飞机制造厂的姊妹厂——发动机制造厂的时候竟发现他已经在这个工厂当起车间主任来了。1942年他真是一个名副其实的小鬼，十三岁，一个大字不识，刚从放羊的牧地上跑到军队来，去年，1956年，中间相隔只十四年，他的岁数一共才二十七岁，可是他的数学早已经学过了微积分，而且当了一个称职、称心的车间主任。
    什么使一个放羊人能够学会并掌握如此高的技术？回答：十月革命，列宁！中国共产党，毛泽东！
    千千万万像这个放羊人般的人，他们不仅成为喷气式飞机乃至其他东西的制造者，而且成为使用者，驾驭者，还有发明者，更重要的他们还成了“以牙还牙，以眼还眼”的战士，都变得特别聪明。
    中国有句古话叫“饮水思源”，这就是叫人不要忘本之意。中国人有今天，能够在自己的土地上站起来，被誉为在解决世界问题上不可缺少的决定力量，他们首先就会想到十月革命的。十月革命一声炮响，给中国带来了无产
  阶级革命，这革命决定了中国人民千秋万载，子孙后代的无穷幸福。
      不错，为了完成这个革命，中国人民曾经流了不少的血，牺牲了不少的英雄和天才，但现在这些英雄和天才他们
  都在九泉含笑了，因为他们的血没有白流，继承他们遗志的有更多的英雄，更大的天才。
    勤劳、勇敢、聪明的中国人民在纪念十月革命伟大的四十年的今天，他们正在大踏步地完成十月革命所提出的任务——社会主义，共产主义。右派分子想把这个历史的车轮拉回去，不仅在政治上注定他们已经失败了，就是在科学技术上，他们的主子——美帝国主义，已经在洲际导弹、人造卫星这两个大回合上输了，大败亏输的输了！
      未来的世界是我们的！
      未来的世界是十月革命的发展！
      十月革命万岁！
      十月革命的光辉永远照耀世界，而
  且在不久的将来将照耀星际。
