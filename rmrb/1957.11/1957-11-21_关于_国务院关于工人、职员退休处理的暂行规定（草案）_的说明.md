Explanation on the "Provisional Regulations (Draft) of the State Council on the Retirement of Workers and Staff"
Minister of Labor, Ma Wenrui

Regarding the retirement of workers and staff, the government already has regulations, namely the relevant provisions in the "Labor Insurance Regulations" issued by the former Government Administration Council in 1951 and revised in 1953, and the "Provisional Measures for the Retirement of State Organ Staff" issued by the State Council at the end of 1955. The former applies to enterprise units implementing labor insurance, and the latter applies to state organs, institutions, and people's organizations. Since the implementation of the above regulations and measures, according to the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the Personnel Bureau of the State Council, as of the end of 1956, approximately 62,000 enterprise employees and approximately 1,000 state organ staff members had retired. Due to the fact that some of the conditions in the current retirement regulations are too strict, and some of the treatment standards are not appropriate enough, a considerable number of elderly and infirm employees who have lost their ability to work are unable or unwilling to retire. These personnel are practically unable to engage in production and work, and it is inappropriate for both the state and themselves to remain in their original units reluctantly. The purpose of formulating these provisional regulations on retirement treatment is to make certain changes to the retirement conditions and post-retirement benefits in the current regulations and measures, so that those employees who should retire can retire. This will not only properly settle this part of the employees, but also help streamline organizations and improve production and work efficiency; it can also save expenses, which can be used to recruit more young apprentices and facilitate labor employment arrangements.

Regarding several main issues in the regulations, the explanation is as follows:

(1) Regarding the conditions for retirement

The retirement conditions in the new regulations are more relaxed than those in the "Labor Insurance Regulations": First, the number of years for "general working years" in items (1) and (2) of Article 2 of the new regulations is reduced by five years compared to the "Labor Insurance Regulations". Second, item (3) of Article 2 stipulates that "workers and staff who are male and at least 50 years old, female and at least 45 years old, have five years of continuous working experience, ten years of general working experience, are physically weak and have lost their ability to work, and have been certified by a doctor as unable to continue working" should retire. This provision did not exist in the "Labor Insurance Regulations". With this provision, a group of employees who are physically weak, have lost their ability to work, and are relatively old, who cannot be handled under the "Labor Insurance Regulations," can retire.

The retirement conditions in the new regulations are more relaxed in some aspects and slightly stricter in others compared to the "Provisional Measures for the Retirement of State Organ Staff". In terms of general working years, the requirement is also reduced by five years. The state organ retirement measures stipulate that staff who have lost their ability to work due to work-related illnesses can retire as long as their working years (the meaning of "working years" is the same as "continuous working years" in the new regulations) are full ten years, regardless of age, while the new regulations also stipulate that such staff must be male and at least 50 years old, female and at least 45 years old. The reason for making such a provision is to ensure consistency with enterprise units, and also to consider that having an age condition for retirement is necessary.

Overall, the retirement conditions have been relaxed. If implemented accordingly, the number of employees who can be processed for retirement will be greater than what can be handled by the current regulations and measures. However, according to the retirement conditions in the new regulations, due to the relationship of working years, the capitalist personnel in joint state-private enterprises cannot be handled. This issue needs to be studied and regulated separately.

(2) Regarding post-retirement benefits

Article 4 of this regulation stipulates that the retirement pension for general elderly retirees shall be paid monthly according to the length of their continuous working years, ranging from 50% to 70% of their original salary, which is the same as the "Labor Insurance Regulations". For preferential treatment for personnel with special contributions, the new regulations allow for an increase of no more than 15% of their original salary, which is 5% higher than the "Labor Insurance Regulations". The new regulations have abolished the on-the-job old-age subsidy, which was equivalent to 10% to 20% of the original salary, as stipulated in the "Labor Insurance Regulations". The provision for on-the-job old-age subsidies is now considered unreasonable, especially since this provision makes some employees who have reached retirement age unwilling to retire, so it should be abolished. However, existing employees receiving on-the-job old-age subsidies who still do not retire are allowed to continue receiving them, because the number of these employees is small, only about 5,000 nationwide.

The retirement pension standard in the new regulations is slightly lower for a small number of people compared to the "Provisional Measures for the Retirement of State Organ Staff" (50% to 80% of the original salary); the preferential treatment for personnel with special contributions has also been changed from "can be increased appropriately" to "no more than 15% of the original salary". In order to align with enterprise unit treatment and avoid mutual influence, it is necessary to make such slight adjustments.

The draft stipulates that the funeral allowance after the death of retirees is equivalent to two to three months of their total retirement pension. This is slightly lower than the provisions of the "Labor Insurance Regulations" (equivalent to two months of the average enterprise wage) and the "Provisional Measures for the Retirement of State Organ Staff" (equivalent to three months of the individual's retirement pension). The "Provisional Measures for the Retirement of State Organ Staff" did not stipulate family allowance for dependents. The standard in the new regulations (equivalent to six to nine months of the individual's retirement pension) is also slightly lower than the provisions of the "Labor Insurance Regulations" (equivalent to six to twelve months of the individual's salary). In order to save costs and unify treatment, it is permissible to slightly reduce these two expenses.

In general, the post-retirement benefits in the new regulations are not significantly different from the current regulations. Here, we must consider both striving for economy and ensuring that employees who should retire are willing to retire. Therefore, we believe that the treatment standards in the new regulations are relatively appropriate and should not be raised or lowered further. If the wage level of employees is further improved in the future, the treatment standards for retirees stipulated in these provisional regulations can also be changed accordingly.

(3) Regarding the payment of retirement pensions

Article 11 of these regulations stipulates that in enterprise units implementing labor insurance, retirement expenses shall be paid from the unit's labor insurance fund. This is the same as the "Labor Insurance Regulations". However, if the unit's labor insurance fund is insufficient to cover expenses, it can be adjusted within the province, autonomous region, or municipality directly under the central government, or within the industrial system (currently, the labor insurance funds of enterprises are managed by either the local trade union or the industrial trade union). If it is still insufficient, the difference shall be paid by the unit's administration. This is because, after the implementation of the new regulations, the number of retirees will increase compared to the past, and the labor insurance funds in some regions and industries may be insufficient to cover expenses, but the "Labor Insurance Regulations" cannot be amended temporarily to increase the collection ratio of labor insurance funds. Therefore, it is necessary to stipulate that the insufficient difference shall be borne by the enterprise's administration.

(4) Regarding the scope of application of these regulations

The relevant retirement and old-age provisions in the "Labor Insurance Regulations" only apply to industrial and mining enterprises and transportation and basic construction departments with more than 100 people, while the new regulations do not have this restriction. This is to be able to retire and handle the cases of more elderly and infirm personnel who have lost their ability to work. This regulation stipulates that for cooperative-run enterprises, it only applies to supply and marketing cooperatives, because the staff of supply and marketing cooperatives are now also workers and staff receiving wages, similar to the situation of state-owned stores. As for the members of handicraft cooperatives and transportation cooperatives, they are mainly members themselves, so this regulation cannot apply to them. In addition, un定息 joint state-private enterprises are generally small in scale and rarely hire workers and staff, so this regulation also does not apply to them.

    关于“国务院关于工人、职员退休处理的暂行规定（草案）”的说明
    劳动部部长　马文瑞
    关于工人、职员的退休处理问题，政府本来是有规定的，就是前政务院于1951年发布、1953年修正的“劳动保险条例”中的有关规定，和国务院于1955年年底发布的“国家机关工作人员退休处理暂行办法”。前者适用于实行劳动保险的企业单位，后者适用于国家机关、事业单位和人民团体。上述条例和办法实施以来，据全国总工会和国务院人事局的了解，截止1956年年底，企业职工退休了约六万二千人，国家机关的工作人员退休了约一千人。由于现行的退休规定某些条件限制严了一些，有些待遇的标准不够适当，因而目前还有相当大的一部分年老的和身体衰弱丧失劳动能力的职工不能够或者不愿意退休。这些人员实际上已经不能从事生产和工作，勉强留在原单位里，对于国家和他们本人都很不相宜。现在制定这个退休处理的暂行规定，目的就是要对于现行条例和办法中的退休的条件和退休以后的待遇作某些改变，以便使那些应该退休的职工能够退休。这样，既可以妥善地安置这一部分职工，又有利于精简机构，提高生产和工作效率；还能够节约经费开支，用来多吸收一些青年学徒，便于安排劳动就业。
    对于规定中的几个主要问题，说明如下：
      （一）关于退休的条件问题
    新规定的退休条件，比“劳动保险条例”的规定是放宽了：一、新规定第二条（一）（二）两项退休条件中“一般工龄”的年限，都比“劳动保险条例”中的规定减少了五年。二、第二条（三）项规定“男年满五十周岁、女年满四十五周岁的工人、职员，连续工龄满五年，一般工龄满十年，身体衰弱丧失劳动能力，经过医生证明不能继续工作的”，应该退休。这一项规定是“劳动保险条例”所没有的，有了这项规定，就可以退休一批根据“劳动保险条例”所不能处理的身体衰弱丧失劳动能力并且也已经比较年老的职工。
    新规定的退休条件，比之“国家机关工作人员退休处理暂行办法”的规定，有放宽处，也有稍严处。在一般工龄方面，同样减少了五年。国家机关退休办法中规定凡是因劳致疾丧失工作能力的工作人员，只要工作年限（“工作年限”的含义和新规定的“连续工龄”相同）满十年，不问年龄多大，就可以退休，而新规定对于这种情况的工作人员还规定必须男年满五十周岁、女年满四十五周岁。这里所以作这样的规定，一则为了与企业单位求得一致，二则考虑到退休有一个年龄的条件，也是必要的。
    总起来看，退休的条件放宽了。如果照此执行，可以作退休处理的职工人数，要比现行的条例和办法所能处理的为多。但是，根据新规定的退休条件，因为工龄的关系，还不能处理公私合营企业中的资方人员，这个问题需要另行研究规定。
      （二）关于退休以后的待遇问题
    这个规定的第四条规定，一般年老退休人员的退休费，按照本人连续工龄的长短逐月发给本人工资的50％到70％，这和“劳动保险条例”的规定是相同的。对于有特殊贡献的人员的优惠待遇，新规定为可以增加不超过本人工资的15％，比“劳动保险条例”的规定高了5％。新规定取消了“劳动保险条例”规定的相当于本人工资10％到20％的在职养老补助费。在职养老补助费的规定，现在看来是不合理的，特别是这一规定使得有些到达退休年龄的职工不愿意退休，因此应该取消。但是，对于现有领取在职养老补助费而仍不退休的职工，准予照旧领取，因为这部分职工为数不多，全国仅约五千人。
    新规定的退休费标准比之“国家机关工作人员退休处理暂行办法”的规定（本人工资的50％到80％），对于少数人来说，是稍降低了一点；对于有特殊贡献的人员的优惠待遇也由“可以酌量提高”改变为“不超过本人工资的15％”。为了和企业单位待遇一致，免得相互影响，这样略加调整是必要的。
    草案规定的退休人员去世以后的丧葬补助费为相当于本人二至三个月的退休费的总额。这比“劳动保险条例”的规定（相当于两个月的企业平均工资的总额）和“国家机关工作人员退休处理暂行办法”的规定（相当于本人三个月的退休费的总额）都略低。亲属抚恤费，“国家机关工作人员退休处理暂行办法”中没有规定，新规定的标准（相当于六至九个月的本人退休费的总额），也比“劳动保险条例”的规定（相当于六至十二个月的本人工资的总额）稍低。为了节约和待遇统一，这两项费用稍予降低是可以的。
    总的看来，新规定的退休以后的待遇和现行的规定出入不大。这里既要考虑力求节约，又要考虑能够使应该退休的职工乐于退休。因此，我们认为新规定的待遇标准是比较适当的，不宜再提高，也不宜再降低。如果将来职工的工资水平有了更多的提高，这个暂行规定中所定的退休人员的待遇标准，还可作相应的改变。
      （三）关于退休费的支付问题
    这个规定的第十一条规定在实行劳动保险的企业单位，退休费用由本单位劳动保险基金中开支。这和“劳动保险条例”的规定是相同的。但是如果本单位的劳动保险基金不敷开支，可以在本省、自治区、直辖市或者本产业系统内进行调剂（目前企业的劳动保险基金，有的是由地方工会管理的，有的是由产业工会管理的），仍然不足的时候，差额部分由本单位行政支付。这是考虑到在实行新规定以后，退休人员和过去比较会增加许多，有些地区、产业的劳动保险基金可能不敷开支，但是一时又不能够修改“劳动保险条例”，提高劳动保险基金的征收比例，因此，有必要规定不足的差额部分由企业行政方面负担。
    （四）关于本规定的适用范围问题
      “劳动保险条例”中的有关退休养老的规定，只适用于百人以上的工矿企业及交通运输、基本建设部门，新规定则没有这种限制，这是为了能够更多地退休处理一些年老和身体衰弱丧失劳动能力的人员。这个规定对于合作社营的企业，规定只适用于供销合作社，因为现在供销合作社的工作人员也都是领取工资的工人、职员，和国营商店的情况相仿。至于手工业合作社和运输合作社的成员，主要地是社员本身，所以不能适用这个规定。另外，未定息的公私合营企业一般规模很小，也很少雇请工人、职员，所以也不适用这个规定。
