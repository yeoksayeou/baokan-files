Another "Red Moon" Rises

As peace-loving people all over the world are warmly celebrating the 40th anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution, thrilling good news has spread all over the world: the successful launch of the Soviet Union's second artificial Earth satellite – another "Red Moon" has risen.

This artificial Earth satellite has greater scientific value than the first one. In addition to the radio transmitter and power source as before, it also carries various scientific research instruments and experimental animals. The total weight of the instruments, experimental animals, and power equipment alone is more than five times the weight of the first artificial Earth satellite; its orbit is higher from the Earth's surface than the first artificial Earth satellite. The success of this launch marks a new stage in the development of satellite launch technology. A month ago, when the Soviet Union successfully launched the first artificial Earth satellite, American generals and politicians, in their panic, tried their best to belittle the great significance of this Soviet scientific and technological achievement, saying that it had no scientific research value, and even absurdly saying that it was just throwing a piece of iron into the air. Now, these gentlemen's absurd words have completely fallen through. Regardless of whether they will create new absurdities, the instruments and experimental animals carried on the Soviet Union's second artificial Earth satellite will undoubtedly greatly expand people's understanding of the physical processes and living conditions in the upper atmosphere and outer space, and enable mankind to take another big step on the road to interstellar travel and conquering outer space.

This world-shaking achievement in Soviet science and technology is a major result of the October Revolution. In the forty years since the October Revolution, Soviet science and technology has indeed progressed at an unprecedented and rapid pace, leaving the United States, which possesses the most powerful science and technology in the capitalist world, far behind in many key departments. This is because the October Revolution fundamentally destroyed the shackles imposed by the evil capitalist system on the development of social production, thereby fundamentally destroying the shackles imposed on the development of science and technology, and turning science and technology to serve the rapid development of socialist production. In socialist Soviet Union, scientists and various technical experts enjoy genuine freedom and ample material conditions that are undreamt of in the capitalist world. They no longer rely on the whims of a handful of multi-millionaires. They have completely freed themselves from the dirty situation of the so-called "free competition" characterized by mutual deception, infighting, keeping secrets from each other, and stealing intelligence from each other among monopoly capital groups, and work for the benefit of the entire people. The Soviet Union's scientific research work is carried out according to a unified plan and cooperation in various aspects. This ensures that all human and material resources for scientific and technological research can play their roles to the maximum extent.

Since the October Revolution, the achievements of Soviet science and technology have been achieved under the leadership of the Communist Party. Only the Communist Party can most accurately assess the international and domestic class struggle situation, grasp the laws of social production development, thereby pointing out the correct direction for the development of science and technology, and provide the most effective support to the most important scientific and technological departments, so that they can obtain all the necessary conditions. More importantly, only the Communist Party can provide the vast number of scientists with the ideological weapon of Marxism-Leninism and organize the national scientific and technological forces into a highly efficient fighting force. Facts have proved that without the leadership of the Communist Party, it would be unimaginable for many important departments of Soviet science and technology to leap to the world's first place in a not very long period of time.

The unparalleled superiority of socialism over capitalism in developing science and technology is becoming increasingly clear to many American scientists as well. Dr. Urey, a famous American atomic physicist, once bluntly said: "The persecution of scientists by the American government has caused many first-class scientists to abandon research work such as artificial satellites, causing American science to lag behind others." He also said: "It is almost impossible to believe that McCarthyism has not had a harmful impact on satellite work." Dr. Ellison, director of the Fermi Nuclear Institute, believes that the "free competition" of capitalism hinders the development of science. We will not discuss Urey's or Ellison's political positions for the moment, but they have already provided the fact that the development of science and technology is shackled under the capitalist system.

The speed of scientific and technological development is an important symbol of the vitality of a social system. Socialist Soviet Union was far behind the capitalist United States in terms of starting point in the peaceful competition of science and technology with the United States. But in the competition, what plays a decisive role is not the starting point but the speed. Because the socialist system ensures the maximum speed of scientific and technological development, the Soviet Union, which was behind at the starting point, has now run ahead of the United States in many key departments. In future competitions, we can conclude that this advantage will become greater and greater.

The successful launch of the Soviet artificial Earth satellite not only marks the rapid development of Soviet rocket technology, automatic control, and other important departments that have decisive significance in modern science, but also marks the growth of the entire national strength of the Soviet Union. Without the powerful development of modern cutting-edge metallurgy, machinery, radio, and other industrial sectors, it would be impossible to solve a series of technical problems in launching such a large satellite. People fully understand the great significance of the growth of Soviet national strength for the cause of defending world peace. The success of the Soviet Union in launching artificial Earth satellites is a fatal blow to the American "strength" policy.

The Soviet Union's artificial Earth satellite is a blessing for human peace. Because it is a pioneer in exploring the mysteries of the universe, it will pave the way for all mankind to reach the moon and other planets. As Chairman Mao Zedong said at the Moscow airport on November 2, "The Soviet Union's launch of the first artificial Earth satellite is not a simple event, and a new era of mankind's further conquest of nature has begun." We Chinese people warmly and heartily congratulate the Soviet scientists and engineering technicians, the Soviet people, the Soviet government, and the Soviet Communist Party on this new great scientific achievement, and extend our highest respect to them.

### 又一个“红色月亮”升起来了

    又一个“红色月亮”升起来了
    当世界各国爱好和平的人民正在热烈庆祝伟大的十月社会主义革命四十周年的时候，一个动人心弦的喜讯传遍了全世界：苏联第二颗人造地球卫星发射成功——又一个“红色月亮”升起来了。
    这颗人造地球卫星比第一颗人造地球卫星具有更大的科学价值，它除了跟上次一样装有无线电发报机和电源以外，还装有多种科学研究仪器和实验动物。仅就这颗卫星所装的仪器、实验动物和电源设备等的总重量就比第一颗人造地球卫星的重量大五倍多；它的轨道离地球表面比第一颗人造地球卫星的更高。这一次发射的成功，标志着卫星发射技术发展的新阶段。一个月以前，当苏联发射第一颗人造地球卫星成功的时候，美国的将军和政客们，在惊慌之余曾竭力贬低苏联这一科学技术成就的伟大意义，说什么没有科学研究价值，甚至荒唐地说什么这不过是把一块铁抛到空中而已。现在，这些先生们的谰言完全破产了，不管他们是否还要制造新的谰言，苏联第二颗人造地球卫星上装载的仪器和实验动物无疑地将大大扩展人们对于大气高层和宇宙空间物理过程和生活条件的了解，使人类在向星际旅行和征服宇宙空间的道路上又大大地迈进了一步。
    苏联科学技术上的这个轰动世界的成就，是十月革命的一个重大成果。十月革命以后的四十年间，苏联的科学技术果然以前所未有的、一日千里的速度向前进展，使拥有资本主义世界最强大的科学技术的美国，在许多带关键性的部门瞠乎其后。这是因为十月革命根本摧毁了罪恶的资本主义制度加在社会生产发展上的桎梏，从而也根本摧毁了加在科学技术发展上的桎梏，使科学技术转而为社会主义的生产的迅速发展服务。在社会主义的苏联，科学家和各种技术专家，享有为资本主义世界所不能梦想的真正的自由和充分的物质条件，他们不再仰承一小撮亿万富翁的鼻息，他们根本摆脱了垄断资本集团之间的尔虞我诈，勾心斗角，互相保守秘密而又互相偷窃情报的所谓“自由竞争”的肮脏局面，为全民利益而劳动。苏联的科学研究工作，按照统一的规划和各方面的协作而进行。这就保证了研究科学技术的一切人力物力能够最大限度地发挥作用。
    十月革命以来，苏联科学技术的成就，都是在共产党的领导下取得的。只有共产党才能够最准确地估计到国际和国内的阶级斗争的形势，掌握社会生产发展的规律，从而指出科学技术发展的正确方向，并给予最重要的科学技术部门以最有效的支持，使其获得一切必要的条件。而更重要的是，只有共产党才能够给予广大科学家以马克思列宁主义的思想武器，能够把全国科学技术力量组织成一个有高度效率的战斗队伍。事实证明，没有共产党的领导，在一个不很长的时期内，苏联的科学技术的许多重要部门跃居世界的第一位是不可想像的。
    在发展科学技术方面社会主义比资本主义具有无比的优越性，这连许多美国科学家也越来越清楚了。美国著名的原子物理学家尤雷博士曾经直截了当地说：“美国政府对科学家的迫害使许多第一流的科学家放弃了人造卫星这样的研究工作而使美国科学落在别人后面。”他并且说：“几乎不可能相信麦卡锡主义没有对卫星工作发生有害的影响。”菲米核子研究所所长艾利逊博士认为，资本主义的“自由竞争”，妨碍了科学的发展。我们姑且不论尤雷或者艾利逊的政治立场如何，然而他们已经提供了在资本主义制度下科学技术的发展受到桎梏的事实。
    科学技术发展的速度，是表明一个社会制度的生命力的重要标志。社会主义的苏联在同资本主义的美国进行科学技术的和平竞赛中，在起点方面是落后于美国很长一个距离的。但在竞赛中，起决定作用的不是起点而是速度。由于社会主义制度保证了科学技术发展的最大速度，在起点上落后的苏联，现在已经在许多关键部门跑到美国前面去了。在今后的竞赛中，我们可以断定这种优势将越来越大。
    苏联人造地球卫星的发射成功，不仅标志着苏联火箭技术、自动控制等等在近代科学中具有决定意义的重要部门突飞猛进的发展，而且标志着苏联整个国力的增长。如果没有现代最新的冶金、机械、无线电等工业部门的强大发展，要解决发射这样大的卫星的一系列技术问题是不可能的。人们完全了解苏联国力的增长，对于保卫世界和平事业具有何等重大的意义。苏联发射人造地球卫星的成功，对于美国的“实力”政策是一种致命的打击。
    苏联发射的人造地球卫星是人类和平的福星。因为它是探索宇宙奥秘的尖兵，它将为全人类开辟通向月球和其它星球的途径。正如11月2日毛泽东主席在莫斯科机场上的讲话中所说的，“苏联发射第一个人造地球卫星不是一个简单的事件，人类进一步征服自然界的新纪元从此开始了。”我们中国人民热烈地衷心地祝贺苏联科学家和工程技术人员、苏联人民、苏联政府和苏联共产党这一新的伟大的科学成就，并向他们致以崇高的敬意。
