Every noon, at the place in the Huanggu Tun Freight Car Repair Factory in Shenyang where big-character posters are put up, there is always an old man with a face full of wrinkles, his hands clasped behind his back, squeezing through the crowd. Sometimes he looks and looks, then suddenly narrows his eyes, as if thinking about something; sometimes he looks and looks, then suddenly strokes the few strands of gray beard on his chin and laughs heartily. He is Hu Qing, a sixty-year-old worker in the fitter group of the Huanggu Tun Freight Car Repair Factory.

Hu Qing said that there are two purposes for looking at big-character posters every day: one is to see what suggestions everyone has made; and the other is to see which problems he can solve, so that he can immediately help the leaders solve them.

These days, Hu Qing seems even busier. He is repairing and making "foot pedals" for several freight cars. This batch of "foot pedals" was neither assigned to them by the leaders, nor was it within his own production plan, but was made by him voluntarily according to the requirements of the big-character posters.

Cai Chengsen, the secretary of the Party branch of the transportation workshop, said: "Old workers are like locomotives, always taking the lead in everything." In the Huanggu Tun Freight Car Repair Factory, there are many old workers like Hu Qing.

The factory building of the transportation workshop has been built for several years, but there has been no heating. It's so cold in winter that people can't even stretch out their hands to work. In the past, workers had made several suggestions to the leaders, but none of them were resolved. This time, during the great blooming and contending, many workers wrote big-character posters criticizing this matter. Not long after, the workshop leaders accepted everyone's criticism and prepared to start installing heating immediately. However, many old workers in the workshop said: "It is good to solve the problem in a timely manner, but we must not forget that we must also run enterprises diligently and frugally!" Many old workers also did detailed calculations. If the heating is installed according to the plan, it will cost at least more than 1,000 yuan, including labor and materials. They said: "If solving one suggestion costs so much money, how much would it cost for more than 10,000 suggestions in the entire factory?"

For this matter, Shang Shiyuan, Sun Mingqing and other old workers of the No. 2 group of locomotive starters in the transportation workshop, specially convened a group meeting. They said: "We have to discuss it and let everyone come up with ideas that don't cost money or cost less money." After a discussion, a solution really came out. Some suggested that there was no need to buy new heating pipes, as there were plenty in the scrap iron pile. Some suggested that there was no need to buy bricks for building the underground trenches, but to pick up bricks in the factory. The more people discussed, the more enthusiastic they became. Later, only one question remained: Who will dig the trenches? The old worker Shang Shiyuan proposed: "This is originally our own business. I propose that we contribute two hours of work today, do you all agree?" Many young people had already been moved by the spirit of these old workers who regarded the factory as their home and built the country diligently and frugally, and answered in unison: "Agree! Agree!"

That day, as soon as they got off work, people began to take action: some went to pick up old heating pipes, some went to get bricks, and some picked up picks and shovels to dig trenches. Many people were so busy that they didn't even bother to eat. At first, only a few people from their group were digging the trenches, but later three or four other groups of old workers also mobilized all the workers in their groups to dig the trenches together. With more people, the strength was greater. The trench, which was more than five meters long and more than one meter deep, was completed in only four days.

    老当家的
    每到中午，在沈阳皇姑屯货车修理工厂贴大字报的地方，总有一个满面皱纹、反背着双手的老人在人群里挤来挤去。他有时看着看着，突然眯缝起双眼，像在想些什么；有时看着看着，突然捋起下巴上那几缕灰白胡子爽快地笑个不停。他是皇姑屯货车修理工厂钳工组六十岁的老工人——胡庆。
    胡庆说，天天看大字报有两个目的，一是看看大伙又提了那些建议；二是看看那些问题是自己能够解决的，好马上帮助领导上解决。
    这几天，胡庆更显得忙碌了，他正在为好几辆货车修理和制作“脚蹬子”。这批“脚蹬子”，既不是领导上分配给他们的，更不是他自己生产计划之内的，是他自己主动根据大字报的要求做的。
    运输车间党支部书记蔡成森说过：“老工人哪，就像火车头似的，不管什么事，总是在前头起着带头作用”。在皇姑屯货车修理工厂，像胡庆那样的老工人还有很多。
    运输车间的厂房已经盖起好几年了，但一直没有暖气。冬天一冷，干活连手都伸不出来。过去，工人曾向领导上提过几次意见，都没得到解决。这次在大鸣大放中，很多工人又写了大字报批评这件事。不多日子，车间领导接受大家批评，预备立即动工安装暖气。但是车间里的许多老工人却说：“及时解决是好，但决不应该忘了我们还要勤俭办企业！”不少老工人还算了细账，要是按计划把暖气安好，连人工带材料，至少也得一千多元。他们说：“如果解决一条意见就花这么些钱，全厂一万多条得花多少钱哪？”
    为了这件事，运输车间机车起动机二组的尚世元、孙明庆等老工人，特意召集了一次小组会。他们说：“得讨论讨论，让大家出出不花钱或少花钱的主意。”一讨论，办法果然出来了。有的提出暖气管子用不着买新的，废铁堆里有的是。有的提出，砌地沟砖也不用买，在厂里拣砖头。人们越讨论越热烈，后来只剩下一个问题了：地沟谁来挖？老工人尚世元倡议说：“这本来就是咱们自己的事，我提议咱们今天献工两个点，大家同意不？”许多青年人早已被这些老工人以厂为家、勤俭建国的精神感动了，齐声回答：“同意！同意！”
    这天一下班，人们便开始了紧张的行动：有的去拣旧暖气管子，有的去弄砖，有的拿起镐头和铁锹挖起地沟来。不少人忙得连饭都没顾得吃。一开始，挖地沟的还只是他们组的几个人，后来又有三四个组的老工人也发动了全组工人，一齐来挖地沟。人多力量大，五公尺多长、一公尺多深的地沟，只挖了四天就完了。　（摘编自沈阳日报）（附图片）
