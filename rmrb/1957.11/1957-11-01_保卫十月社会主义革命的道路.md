In 1848, Marx and Engels said in the "Communist Manifesto": "A specter is haunting Europe—the specter of communism." Sixty-nine years later, on November 7, 1917, the sound of gunfire from the rebellious workers and soldiers of Petrograd, and the electrifying radio waves from the cruiser "Aurora" that shocked the world, announced the beginning of a new era for mankind, and announced that "the specter of communism" had begun to transform into a giant in ancient, backward Russia. Forty years later, on November 7, 1957, people saw: Soviet laborers are selflessly engaged in the construction of the new life of the Sixth Five-Year Plan, and are transitioning to communism; thirteen countries, possessing 26% of the world's territory and 35% of the world's population, are advancing under the banner of socialism; half of the world's total population (1.3 billion) in the past twelve years after the war, have risen up to shake off the heavy shackles of colonial rule; the number of communists in countries around the world has exceeded 33 million, these noble warriors, are waging uninterrupted battles against the old world and against nature. "The specter of communism" has increasingly penetrated the hearts of laborers all over the world, and has become an overwhelming positive trend representing the direction of historical development. The path revealed by the "Communist Manifesto," the path of the great October Socialist Revolution, will forever guide people to follow the laws of historical development and move towards socialism-communism.

The editor-in-chief of "Pravda," Comrade Satyukov, pointed out at the Moscow celebration of the Chinese National Day on September 30: "The Soviet people, while preparing to greet the 40th anniversary of the great October Revolution, are celebrating the 8th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, and are deeply grateful to the fraternal Chinese Communist Party for the tremendous work it has done in the past and present in promoting the historical significance of the October Revolution for the fate of the oppressed nations of the East, for the Chinese people, and for the entire international communist movement." Comrade Satyukov's assertion is profound and correct. The Chinese communists, the revolutionary masses of the Chinese people, have always been faithful to the path of the October Socialist Revolution in the long years of struggle, and have a profound and intimate understanding of the profound influence and positive significance of the October Revolution. The Chinese people believed in the past, believe now, and will continue to believe in the future: the light of the October Socialist Revolution illuminates the common path of the proletariat of all countries, including the path of the Chinese proletariat and the broad masses of the people; the great achievements created by the Soviet people in the past forty years are an invaluable common treasure in the cause of human progress. Holding high the glorious banner of the October Socialist Revolution, defending the common path of the October Revolution, adhering to the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism, and constantly consolidating the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and the unity of the working people of the world, is a matter of the fundamental interests of the Chinese people and the working people of the world, and is the most sublime internationalist obligation of the Chinese people.

The Chinese people's search for the path of the October Revolution was not without twists, turns, difficulties, and obstacles. The Opium War awakened the Chinese people. Many of our predecessors, many people with lofty ideals, once shed blood and sacrificed their lives for the vague future of China, and wrote magnificent epics that are forever worthy of praise by future generations; however, their beautiful ideals were ultimately buried under the shadows of the swords of imperialism and feudal emperors and kings. "The salvo of the October Revolution brought us Marxism-Leninism. The October Revolution helped advanced elements throughout the world and in China to use the proletarian world outlook as an instrument for studying a nation’s destiny and re-considering their own problems. Follow the path of the Russians—that was their conclusion." (Mao Zedong: "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship") The great Sun Yat-sen, as a pioneer of the Chinese democratic revolution, as a warrior who "exhausted his efforts and died only after his heart stopped beating" for the people, in his later years, after many failures and setbacks, came to the brilliant conclusion of "taking Russia as a teacher." On his deathbed, he wrote a passionate letter to the Soviet Union, calling the Soviet people "dear comrades," "hoping that dawn will soon break, when the Soviet Union will welcome a strong and independent China as a good friend and ally, and the two countries will join hands and advance in the great war for the freedom of the oppressed nations of the world to achieve victory." Therefore, following the path of the October Socialist Revolution is not accidental, but is determined by the inevitable laws of social and historical development in China, and is a wise choice made by all advanced figures and the broad masses of the people who are truly determined to serve the country and the people in the face of the tide of history. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people have contributed their blood, their lives, their sweat, their labor and wisdom, without any hesitation or reservation, to the glorious path of the October Revolution, "consistently regarding the Chinese revolution as a continuation of the great October Socialist Revolution, and taking this as the greatest honor," the most fundamental reason is that only the path of the October Revolution can ultimately liberate the Chinese people themselves. It is precisely for this reason that the Chinese people are filled with respect and gratitude for the pioneers of the October Socialist Revolution—the Russian people—and tirelessly promote the historical significance of the October Socialist Revolution.

The success of the October Socialist Revolution and the achievements of the Soviet Union's forty years of construction are the first resounding paean of Marxism-Leninism in human history. What does the path of the October Revolution mean? We believe that its basic characteristics are: the leadership of the Communist Party, the seizure of power from the bourgeoisie through revolutionary struggle, the dictatorship of the proletariat, the planned development of socialist economy and socialist culture, adherence to the principles of proletarian internationalism, and tireless maintenance of world peace. The article "More on the Historical Experience of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat" points out: "The path of the October Revolution, as we usually call it, aside from the specific forms it took at the time and place, refers to these basic things. These basic things are the universal truths of Marxism-Leninism that are applicable everywhere." The Chinese people have never wavered in the slightest degree about these basic things and universal truths, even though our Chinese revolution has its own unique characteristics. When I visited the Soviet Union with the delegation of the National People's Congress last winter and spring, at a grand banquet, Comrade Khrushchev praised the achievements of the Chinese people and the victories achieved by the Chinese Communist Party in leading the Chinese people in socialist revolution and socialist construction. Comrade Khrushchev believed that "China's experience in socialist construction is valuable and noteworthy." Comrade Peng Zhen pointed out in his speech at the banquet: "Comrade Khrushchev said that China has many new experiences. Yes, we do have some new experiences. However, we deeply know that we cannot exaggerate it in the slightest degree, and we deeply know that some of our creative experiences are only a small part of the whole of Marxism-Leninism, the experience of the Soviet revolution and construction, and the experience of the world's proletarian struggle. To use an analogy: our experience is like some of the branches, leaves and flowers on this bottle of flowers in front of us, while the whole of Marxism-Leninism, the whole experience of the world's proletarian struggle, is like the roots and stem of the flowers. The flowers, leaves and branches are an integral whole that grows out of the roots and stem of the flowers." "We always say that our Chinese revolution is following the path of the October Socialist Revolution. This is not because we are being modest, but because it is a fact." I believe that Comrade Peng Zhen has very appropriately expressed the true feelings of the Chinese people.

On the eve of the anti-Rightist struggle, a countercurrent of anti-communist revisionism emerged. This countercurrent wanted to use abstract rhetoric to tamper with the path of the October Socialist Revolution, in order to carry out its ulterior motives of weakening, opposing and abolishing the leadership of the Communist Party. This countercurrent has now been defeated. Defeating this countercurrent at least illustrates two issues: First, there are still some people who are still defying the laws of historical development and making dying struggles, the class struggle has not been extinguished, and the leadership of the Communist Party and the dictatorship of the proletariat must be strengthened; second, the path of the October Revolution, the path of socialist revolution, will surely win victory on a larger scale in the world. Therefore, it can be said that the victory of the anti-Rightist struggle, in its essential significance, is also the victory of the path of the October Socialist Revolution. The Superiority of the Socialist System

The success of the October Socialist Revolution and the Soviet Union's strong development over the past forty years have shown people a truth: for many years, laborers in a state of oppression and exploitation do not have to rely on oppressors and exploiters to exist independently. Without these bloodsuckers, laborers can still live, and live very well. As the "Communist Manifesto" says: "The proletarians have nothing to lose in this revolution but their chains. They have a world to win."

When the Soviet Union implemented its First Five-Year Plan, an American publication published a paper saying that the Russians had put forward the slogan of catching up with the United States, but they were taking a muddy and bumpy road, and the builders were traveling by ox cart. According to the ideas of these American gentlemen, Russia with "old oxen and broken carts" would never be able to catch up with their so-called highly developed United States of science and technology. However, strangely enough, in less than forty years, the world's first artificial satellite was launched by the Soviet Union, the first atomic power plant was built by the Soviet Union, and the first intercontinental missile was also successfully tested by the Soviet Union. As is well known, these achievements are not simply the victory of a certain science, but the victory of physics, chemistry, mathematics, jet technology, radio technology and other sectors of science and technology, and most fundamentally, the victory of the socialist system. As for the Soviet Union's victories in industry, agriculture, culture and education, they are even more sufficient to illustrate the incomparable superiority of the socialist system.

At present, the superiority of the socialist system is no longer a theoretical issue, but a factual issue. Russia, which used to be backward in Europe, has surpassed the United States and Britain, which claim to be "scientifically advanced," in science and technology today, forty years later. This, of course, makes the members of the US Congress and the aristocratic lords of Britain feel a headache. They were shocked and told each other, as if "disaster was imminent." However, headaches cannot solve any problems after all. The success of the Soviet missile test and the thunderous and stern warning forced Britain, France, and Israel to withdraw their evil bloody hands that had been extended to Egypt last year; this year, the successful launch of the Soviet artificial earth satellite will naturally force the US warmongers to become slightly more sober. But why did the Soviet Union run ahead? To find the real answer to this question, it is still necessary to explore from the social system itself, not to argue and shout in the corridors of the US Capitol. In countries with capitalist systems, everything serves the pockets of the bosses, serves higher and higher profits, serves bloody wars of aggression, so the genius and wisdom and perseverance of all scientists will be stifled, and scientists with conscience and accomplishment cannot have any room to stretch their talents.

On the eve of the anti-Rightist struggle, a countercurrent of doubt about the superiority of the socialist system emerged. According to the views of some Rightist gentlemen, the socialist system has no superiority to speak of, and it can only be the source of personality cults and "three evils". We must answer the Rightist gentlemen that the Soviet communists bravely opposed and criticized the harm of personality cults, the Chinese communists openly exposed the harm of the "three evils", the incomparably brilliant achievements of the Soviet Union's construction over the past forty years, the rapid progress of China and all people's democratic countries, all these can only illustrate that the socialist system has endless vitality and indisputable superiority. Therefore, it can be said that the victory of the anti-Rightist struggle is the victory of defending the socialist political and economic system in our country.

Learn from the Soviet Union, Always "Lean to One Side"

The success of the October Socialist Revolution and the achievements of the Soviet Union's construction over the past forty years, the rich experience of the Soviet Union, will always be our model for learning. The Soviet Party, government, and people, based on the principles of internationalism, have given us selfless, enormous, and systematic assistance. On the land of our motherland, a power station, a dam, a bridge, a enterprise, all have the blood and sweat and wisdom of the Soviet people in them. To build our country into an advanced industrial country, we must tirelessly learn from the Soviet Union while thanking the Soviet Union for its assistance.

The towering presence and strong strength of the Soviet Union are the pillar of defending world peace in the contemporary era. At a time when the two major camps are fighting fiercely in the current international arena, we must firmly lean to the side of the Soviet Union and contribute our strength to defending world peace and the cause of human progress. "Lean to one side," always lean to the side of the Soviet Union. Any wavering on this issue will in fact fall into the traps and snares of imperialism.

On the eve of the anti-Rightist struggle, a countercurrent of opposing learning from the Soviet Union and opposing the "leaning to one side" foreign policy emerged. According to the views of some Rightist gentlemen, learning from the Soviet Union has messed things up; the Soviet Union is too stingy, it is not worthwhile to "lean to one side", it is better to "straddle two boats" and watch the wind to steer the ship. We must answer the Rightist gentlemen that creatively learning from the Soviet Union in combination with reality will always be our direction, and we will never allow anyone to use the name of opposing dogmatism to actually oppose learning from the Soviet Union; leaning to the side of the Soviet Union and consolidating the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is our firm policy in international affairs, and any "middle route" etc. can only lean towards the embrace of imperialism, and we will never allow certain people to wear the guise of sham "patriots" to spread the poison of bourgeois nationalism. Therefore, it can be said that the victory of the anti-Rightist struggle has strengthened the Chinese people's determination to learn from the Soviet Union and "lean to one side" in international affairs.

With practical struggle and hard work, bravely defend the path of the October Revolution, vigorously consolidate the socialist system, study the Soviet Union in a practical and humble manner, and unswervingly strengthen the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union: this is our gift to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution!

    保卫十月社会主义革命的道路
    程潜
    1848年，马克思、恩格斯在“共产党宣言”中说：“一个怪影在欧洲游荡着——共产主义的怪影。”六十九年之后，1917年11月
  7日，彼得堡起义工人、士兵的炮声，“阿芙乐尔”号巡洋舰发出的震惊世界的电波，宣布人类新纪元的开始，宣布“共产主义的怪影”在古老、落后的俄国开始变为现实的巨人。再过四十年，1957年11月7日，人们看到：苏联劳动者正在忘我地从事建设新生活的第六个五年计划，正在向共产主义过渡；拥有全世界26％的领土、35％的人口的十三个国家，正在社会主义旗帜下前进；占全世界总人口的一半（十三亿）的国家和人民，在战后十二年之间，奋起摆脱了殖民地统治的沉重枷锁；全世界各国的共产党员已经超过了三千三百万人，这些高贵的战士，正在向旧世界、向自然界展开不间歇的战斗。“共产主义的怪影”已经日益深入全世界劳动者的心灵，变成了一股沛然莫之能御的、代表历史发展方向的正面潮流。“共产党宣言”揭示出的道路，伟大的十月社会主义革命的道路，永远指引着人们遵循历史发展的规律，朝着社会主义——共产主义前进。
      “真理报”总编辑萨丘科夫同志9月30日在莫斯科庆祝中国国庆大会上指出：“苏联人民在准备迎接伟大的十月革命四十周年的日子里庆祝中华人民共和国成立八周年，并且深深感激兄弟的中国共产党过去和现在宣传十月革命对东方被压迫民族的命运、对中国人民和整个国际共产主义运动的命运的历史性意义方面所进行的巨大工作。”萨丘科夫同志的论断是深刻和正确的。中国的共产党人，中国的革命的人民群众，在长期的斗争的岁月里，一直忠实于十月社会主义革命的道路，对于十月革命道路的深厚影响和积极意义有着血肉般的感受。中国人民过去认为，现在认为，将来也同样认为：十月社会主义革命的光芒，照亮了各国无产阶级的共同道路，包括中国无产阶级和广大人民的道路；苏联人民四十年来所创造的伟大成就，是人类进步事业中无可估价的共同财富。高举十月社会主义革命的光辉旗帜、保卫十月革命的共同道路、坚持马克思列宁主义的普遍真理、不断地巩固以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结和全世界劳动人民的团结，是有关中国人民和全世界劳动人民根本利益的问题，是中国人民的最崇高的国际主义的义务。
    中国人民寻找十月革命的道路，不是没有经过曲折困难和艰难险阻的。鸦片战争唤起了中国人民的觉醒，我们有许多前辈，有许多仁人志士，为了矇矓的中国的前途，曾经抛头颅，洒热血，写下了壮丽的、永远值得后人表彰的史诗；但是，他们的美丽的理想，最终还是葬送在帝国主义和封建帝王的刀光血影之下。“十月革命一声炮响，给我们送来了马克思列宁主义。十月革命帮助了全世界的也帮助了中国的先进分子，用无产阶级的宇宙观作为观察国家命运的工具，重新考虑自己的问题。走俄国人的路——这就是结论。”（毛主席：“论人民民主专政”）伟大的孙中山先生，作为中国民主主义革命运动的先行者，作为一个为人民“鞠躬尽瘁、死而后已”的战士，晚年在经过多次失败和挫折之后，得出了“以俄为师”的光辉结论，在其弥留之际，他写下了热情洋溢的致苏联遗书，他称苏联人民为“亲爱的同志”，“希望不久即将破晓，斯时苏联以良友及盟国而欢迎强盛独立之中国，两国在争世界被压迫民族自由之大战中，携手并进以取得胜利。”因此说，遵循十月社会主义革命的道路不是偶然的，是中国社会和历史发展的必然规律所决定的，是中国一切真正有志于为国为民的先进人物和广大群众在历史洪流面前的充满智慧的选择。中国人民在中国共产党领导之下，把自己的血，自己的生命，自己的汗，自己的劳动和智慧，毫无吝惜地、毫无保留地贡献给十月革命的光辉道路，“一贯把中国革命看作是伟大的十月社会主义革命的继续，并且以此为莫大的光荣”，最根本的原因是，只有十月革命的道路，才能最终地解放中国人民自己。也正因为如此，所以中国人民对十月社会主义革命的开路先锋——俄国人民怀着尊敬和感激之情，不倦地宣传
  十月社会主义革命的历史性意义。
      十月社会主义革命的成功和苏联四十年建设的成就，是马克思列宁主义在人类历史上第一曲响彻云霄的凯歌。十月革命的道路意味着什么呢？我们认为，它的基本性质是：共产党的领导，经过革命斗争从资产阶级手里取得政权，无产阶级专政，有计划地发展社会主义经济和社会主义文化，坚持无产阶级国际主义原则和不懈怠地维护世界和平。“再论无产阶级专政的历史经验”一文指出：“我们平常所说的十月革命的道路，撇开它在当时当地所表现的具体形式来说，就是指的这些基本的东西。这些基本的东西，都是放之四海而皆准的马克思列宁主义的普遍真理。”对于这些基本的东西和普遍的真理，中国人民从来不曾有过任何一丝一毫的动摇，尽管我们中国的革命运动有着自己的独特之处。去冬今春我随全国人大代表团访苏时，在一次盛大的宴会上，赫鲁晓夫同志曾经盛赞中国人民所获得的成就，赞扬领导中国人民进行社会主义革命和社会主义建设的中国共产党所取得的胜利。赫鲁晓夫同志认为“中国的社会主义建设的经验是宝贵而引人注意的经验”。彭真同志在宴会的演说
  上随即指出：“赫鲁晓夫同志说，中国有很多新的经验。是的，我们是有一些新的经验。但是，我们深深地知道，我们丝毫都不能把它夸大，我们深深地知道我们的一些创造性的经验，对于马克思列宁主义的整体来说，对于苏联的革命和建设经验来说，对于全世界无产阶级斗争的经验来说，只不过是一个小的部分。打个比喻：我们的经验好比是我们面前这瓶花上的一些枝叶和一些花朵，而马克思列宁主义的整体，世界无产阶级斗争的经验的整体，则好比是花的根和干。花朵和枝叶正是从花的根干上长出来的一个统一体。”“我们总是说，我们中国革命是走的十月社会主义革命的道路。这并不是因为我们谦虚，而是因为这是事实。”我认为，彭真同志是很恰当地表达了中国人民的真情实感的。
    在反右派斗争的前夕，出现了一股反共的修正主义的逆流。这股逆流想用抽象的词藻，来篡改十月社会主义革命的道路，遂行其削弱、反对和取消共产党领导的不可告人的目的。这股逆流现在已经被击败了。击败这股逆流，至少说明两个问题：第一、现今还有一部分人，仍然在违抗历史发展的规律，作垂死的挣扎，阶级斗争并未熄灭，共产党的领导和无产阶级专政必须加强；第二、十月革命的道路，社会主义革命的道路，必将在更大的世界范围内获得胜利。因此，可以说，反右派斗争的胜利，从其本质的意义上来说，也是十月社会主义革命道路的胜利。社会主义制度的优越性
    十月社会主义革命的成功和苏联四十年来的强大发展，向人们说明一个真理：多少年来处于被压迫、被剥削状态的劳动者，不必依靠压迫者和剥削者而独立存在。没有这些吃血鬼，劳动者同样可以过日子，而且日子过得很好。这正如“共产党宣言”所说：“无产者在这革命中只会失去自己颈上的一条锁链。他们所能获得的却是整个世界。”
    当苏联实行第一个五年计划的时候，美国的刊物曾经登出一篇论文，这篇论文说，俄国人提出赶过美国的口号，但走的是泥泞满地、坎坷不平的道路，建设者乘着牛车走。按照这些美国老爷们的想法，
  “老牛破车”的俄国，永远也赶不上他们所谓科学技术高度发展的美国。但是，奇怪得很，不出四十年，世界上第一个人造卫星是苏联发射的，第一个原子能电力站是苏联建成的，第一个洲际导弹也是苏联试验成功的。如所周知，这些成就，不单纯是某一门科学的胜利，而是物理学、化学、数学、喷气技术、无线电技术和其它部门科学技术的胜利，而最根本的，则是社会主义制度的胜利。至于苏联在工业、农业、文化教育事业上的胜利，更足以说明社会主义制度有着无可比拟的优越性。
    现时，关于社会主义制度的优越性，已经不是一个理论性的问题，而是一个事实上的问题。在欧洲来说曾经是落后的俄国，四十年后的今天，竟然在科学技术上赶过了自诩为“科学先进”的美国和英国。这一点，当然使美国的议员们和英国的爵士贵族们感到头痛，他们大惊失色，奔走相告，似乎“大难临头”。但是，头痛毕竟不能解决任何问题。苏联导弹试验的成功和雷霆万钧的严正警告，去年曾经迫使英、法、以缩回了伸到埃及的侵略的罪恶的血手；今年苏联人造地球卫星的发射成功，自然不能不迫使美国的好战分子们变得稍微清醒一些。但是，为什么苏联跑到前头去了呢？要寻找这个问题的真正的答案，并不能在美国议会厅的走廊旁边去争吵叫嚷，仍然要从社会制度本身去探讨。在资本主义制度的国家里，一切为老板们的钱袋服务，为高的、更高的利润服务，为血腥的侵略战争服务，因此，一切科学家的天才智慧和聪明毅力就要遭受扼杀，而有良心的、有造诣的科学家，就不可能有任何伸展余地。
    在反右派斗争的前夕，出现了一股怀疑社会主义制度优越性的逆流。据某些右派老爷们的见解，社会主义制度没有什么优越性可言，它只能是产生个人崇拜和“三害”的根源。必须回答右派老爷们，苏联共产党人勇敢地反对和批判个人崇拜的危害，中国共产党人公开地揭露“三害”的危害，苏联四十年来建设的无可比拟的光辉的成就，中国和一切人民民主国家日新月异的进步，所有这一切，只能说明社会主义制度有着无穷无尽的生命力和不容争辩的优越性。因此，可以说，反右派斗争的胜利，是在我们国家内保卫社会主义的政治和经济制度的胜利。
    学习苏联，永远“一边倒”
      十月社会主义革命的成功和苏联四十年来建设的成就，苏联的丰富经验，永远是我们学习的榜样。苏联党、政府和人民，根据国际主义的原则，给我们以无私的、巨大的、系统的援助。在我们祖国的土地上，一个发电站，一座水坝，一架桥梁，一个企业，都有着苏联人民的血汗和智慧在内。要把我们的国家建设成为一个先进的工业国家，我们必须在感谢苏联援助的同时，不倦怠地向苏联学习。
    苏联的巍然屹立和实力的强大，是当代保卫世界和平的支柱。在现今国际上两大阵营搏斗的时候，我们必须坚定地倒向苏联一边，为保卫世界和平和人类进步事业贡献出自己的力量。“一边倒”，永远地倒向苏联一边。在这个问题上如果有任何动摇，就会在事实上落入帝国主义的陷阱和圈套。
    在反右派斗争的前夕，出现了一股反对学习苏联、反对“一边倒”的外交政策的逆流。据某些右派老爷们的见解，学习苏联搞糟了；苏联太小气了，“一边倒”划不来，不如“脚踏两边船”，看风使舵。必须回答右派老爷们，创造性地、结合实际地学习苏联，永远是我们的方向，我们断不容许借反对教条主义之名，行反对学习苏联之实；倒向苏联一边，巩固以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结，是我们在国际事务中的坚定方针，什么“中间路线”等等，只能倒向帝国主义的怀抱，我们断不容许某些人披着冒牌的“爱国者”的外衣，来散播资产阶级民族主义的毒药。因此说，反右派斗争的胜利，坚定了我国人民学习苏联、在国际事务中“一边倒”的决心。
    以实际的斗争和辛勤的劳动，勇敢地保卫十月革命的道路，大力地巩固社会主义制度，联系实际地、虚心地学习苏联，坚持不渝地加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结：这就是我们庆祝十月革命四十周年的献礼！
