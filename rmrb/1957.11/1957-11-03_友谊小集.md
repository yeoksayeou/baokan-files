    "War Horse"
    On the construction site, there is a giant 15-ton crane. The crane driver, Lao Lü, cherishes the crane very much. Every few days, he polishes the machinery of the crane until it shines. Master Lü calls this giant crane his "war horse." He often says, "This is a 'war horse' given to me by our Soviet big brother. I ride on its back, and with a wave of its arm, it can hoist roof panels and T-beams weighing thousands of pounds into the sky."
    These days, the owner of the "war horse" has somehow obtained a red cloth with a line of large characters written on white paper: "Salute to the Great Soviet Union!" Now the "war horse" is dressed in red and looks even more majestic! Lao Lü always tells people, "Back then, Guan Yu loved his old Red Hare because it could help him win battles. And I value my 'war horse' because it helps us build socialism, and also because of my love for the Soviet Union..."

    Poster
    I came to Master Zhu's house, and as soon as I entered, I saw Master Zhu standing on a stool, holding a brand-new color picture in one hand and hammering picture nails into the clean white wall with the other. I asked, "Master Zhu, do you still like art and buy new pictures?" Master Zhu's wife stood aside and said, "Look at him, he's forty or fifty years old, and still so lively! We've bought more than a dozen pictures for our home, including pictures of beautiful women and the Eight Immortals crossing the sea. Today, he bought four more Soviet pictures. Young people aren't as fond of pictures and beauty as you are!" Master Zhu came down from the stool and said, "You don't understand my feelings about posting these pictures! Look outside, everywhere is decorated with lanterns and colors, celebrating our great Soviet October Revolution. Shouldn't we have some Soviet souvenirs at home to celebrate this great holiday?"

    “战马”
    工地上有一架十五吨重的巨型装吊车，装吊车的司机老吕非常爱护车子，他三天两头，就要把车子上的机器擦得油光滑亮的。吕师傅把这个巨型的装吊车叫做自己的“战马”。他常说：“这是苏联老大哥送给我的‘战马’，我骑在它的背上，任它千万斤重的屋面板、丁字梁，一举臂就能把它挥向天空。”
    这几天，“战马”的主人，不知从哪儿弄来一条红布，上面用白报纸写了一行大字：“向伟大的苏联致敬！”现在“战马”全身披红挂彩显得更雄壮！老吕总是对人说：“想当年关云长爱他老赤兔马是因为它能助他一臂之力打胜仗，而我器重我的‘战马’是因为它帮助我们建设社会主义，另外也是为了对苏联的爱……”。
    招贴画
    我来到了朱师傅家里，一进门就看到了朱师傅双脚站在凳子上，一手拿了张新崭崭的彩色画；一手拿着图画钉正在洁白的墙壁上钉呀钉的。我问：“朱师傅还喜欢美术买新画哇？”朱师傅老伴站在一旁，说道：“瞧他四五十岁人了，还好热闹呢！咱家里买了十几张画，有美女画还有八仙过海画，今天他又买了四张苏联的画来了。人家小青年，也不像你那么爱画爱美的！”朱师傅从凳上下来，说道：“你们哪里知道我贴画的心情呵？你们看那外面，到处都在张灯结彩，热热闹闹迎接咱们伟大的苏联的十月革命节，难道咱家里不应该弄个苏联的纪念品来庆祝这个伟大的节日吗？”
