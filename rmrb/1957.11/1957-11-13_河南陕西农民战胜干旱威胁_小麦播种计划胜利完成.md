Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, November 12th: Henan Province has sown 71.47 million mu of wheat, exceeding the province's wheat planting plan. According to inspections, the wheat sowing quality is good, and the seedlings are growing vigorously.

Henan Province's wheat planting plan was completed under extremely difficult conditions. From mid-July to late October, there was no rain for more than three months, and the drought was the worst in more than a decade. To overcome this difficulty, the province mobilized 15 million people daily and put them on the drought resistance front during the intense wheat planting season. Nearly one million cadres, workers, students, and People's Liberation Army officers and soldiers, carrying tools and luggage, worked day and night with the farmers, opening roads through mountains and building bridges over ditches, using methods such as carrying water and waterwheels, to fight the drought and plant more than 20 million mu of wheat. In addition, areas with water conservancy conditions were irrigated and planted. The wheat planted in severe drought conditions accounted for 80% of the wheat planting plan. In late October, rainfall occurred throughout the province, and farmers in various places, in addition to actively rushing to plant wheat fields that had not yet been sown, also organized and led efforts to check and replant seedlings. Now, the wheat seedlings are lush green, and more than 70% of the wheat fields have been fertilized with base fertilizer.

Combined with drought resistance and wheat planting, farmers throughout the province have launched a high tide of water conservancy construction with the spirit of moving mountains and overturning seas. Within a month, 330,000 new wells were dug and old wells repaired, more than 11,000 mountain springs were excavated, and the irrigated area was expanded by more than 6.1 million mu, completing the annual water conservancy construction plan.

Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an: Shaanxi Province has successfully completed this year's task of sowing more than 24 million mu of winter wheat. The wheat sown earlier is already a tender green, and the wheat sown recently is also germinating and emerging.

This autumn, when wheat was being sown, many places in Shaanxi Province were dry and without rain. More than 30,000 agricultural cooperatives throughout the province have demonstrated great superiority in drought resistance and wheat planting. Many agricultural cooperatives put forward the slogan "Overcome drought and ensure that not one mu of wheat is planted less," setting off a high tide of drought resistance and wheat planting. In the entire Weibei Plateau area, from Hancheng and Heyang in the east to Longxian and Binyang in the west, members of agricultural cooperatives in nineteen counties adopted methods such as carrying water from the source to splash and irrigate, repeatedly rolling and harrowing, or roughly digging the land first and then deep plowing, so that many wheat fields that were too dry and hard to plow could be sown in a timely manner. Farmers in more than 20 large irrigation areas in Guanzhong, such as Jinghui, Weihui, and Luohui, irrigated and planted wheat day and night. Yan'an, Shangluo prefectures, and seventeen counties including Pucheng, Dali, and Weinan, mobilized the masses to dig wells, repair canals, and expand irrigated areas, ensuring the completion of the wheat sowing task. Now, farmers in various places are checking and replanting seedlings and processing and fertilizing wheat fields, striving for a bumper wheat harvest next year.

    河南陕西农民战胜干旱威胁
    小麦播种计划胜利完成
    据新华社郑州12日电　河南省已经播种小麦七千一百四十七万亩，超额完成全省小麦播种计划。据检查，小麦播种质量良好，麦苗生长旺盛。
    河南省的小麦播种计划是在困难重重的条件下完成的。从7月中旬到10月下旬，三个多月没有下雨，干旱程度为十几年来所未有。为了战胜这个困难，全省在麦播紧张时期，每日出动一千五百万人，投入抗旱战线。广大干部、工人、学生、解放军官兵等近百万人，带着工具，背着行李，日日夜夜的和农民一起，逢山开路，遇沟架桥，用挑水、车水等办法，抗旱种麦二千多万亩。再加上有水利条件的地方，浇地播种，在严重干旱情况下播种的小麦，占小麦播种计划80％。10月下旬全省降雨，各地农民除积极抢种尚未下种的麦田外，还有组织有领导地进行查苗补苗。现在，麦苗一片葱绿，70％以上的麦田施了底肥。
    结合抗旱种麦，全省农民以移山倒海的气概，掀起了兴修水利的热潮。在一个月内，打新井、修旧井三十三万眼，挖山泉一万一千多处，扩大浇地面积六百一十多万亩，完成了全年的水利建设计划。
    据新华社西安电　陕西省已经胜利完成了今年播种二千四百多万亩冬小麦的任务。播种较早的小麦已经一片嫩绿，最近播种的也正在发芽出苗。
    今年秋天正当小麦播种时，陕西省许多地方干旱不雨。全省三万多个农业社在抗旱种麦中发挥了巨大优越性。许多农业社提出“战胜干旱，保证不少种一亩麦”的口号，掀起抗旱种麦的热潮。在东起韩城、郃阳西至陇县、洴阳整个渭北高原区十九个县的农业社社员，采用从原下担水泼浇，反复碾耱，或先将地粗略挖开，然后再深耕的方法，使许多干硬得犁不进去的麦田，能够适时下种。关中的泾惠、渭惠和洛惠等二十多个大型灌溉地区的农民夜以继日地灌溉种麦。延安、商雒专区和蒲城、大荔、渭南等十七县，用发动群众打井、修渠，扩大浇地面积，保证了小麦播种任务的完成。现在，各地农民正在查苗补苗和给麦田加工加肥，争取明年小麦丰收。
