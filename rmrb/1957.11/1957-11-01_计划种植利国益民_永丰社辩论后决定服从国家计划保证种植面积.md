Planned Planting Benefits the Country and the People
	Yongfeng Cooperative Decides to Obey National Plan and Guarantee Planting Area After Debate

	(Our Newspaper) News: “Planned planting benefits the country and the people, while free planting harms the country and oneself.” This is the conclusion reached by the Yongfeng Agricultural Cooperative in Lan'gao County, Shaanxi Province, after holding a debate on the issue of implementing the national plan before the autumn planting.

	Compared with the national plan, this cooperative's autumn sowing plan reduced the wheat area by 20%, the oilseed area by 40%, and increased the potato area by more than 50%. The discussion started with "Why can't the national plan be completed?" and then turned to "The relationship between the national plan and farmers."

	As the discussion deepened, some proposed that planting more wheat would lead to state requisition, while planting more potatoes would benefit themselves. Some even asked, "We can't even buy oil, so why bother planting oil crops?" These issues exposed the serious localism among the cooperative members and their lack of understanding of the relationship between the national plan and the farmers. Through discussion, everyone clearly realized that: if agriculture does not support industry, don't expect industry to support agriculture. Obeying the national plan is beneficial to the country and the farmers; free planting causes losses to the country and harms oneself. As for the insufficient supply of edible oil, after discussion, everyone realized that it was mainly due to too little production, which could not keep up with consumption needs. Taking the cooperative's situation as an example, before the establishment of the cooperative, the whole village harvested more than twenty dan (石) of oil crops, but last year it only harvested more than two dan.

	After the cooperative members improved their ideological understanding, the cooperative management committee decided to fully complete the national allocation plan for more than 1,100 mu of grain and oil crop planting area.

    计划种植利国益民
    永丰社辩论后决定服从国家计划保证种植面积
    本报讯　“计划种植利国益民，自由种植损国害己。”这是陕西省岚皋县永丰农业社在秋种前就执行国家计划问题举行了一场辩论后的结论。
    这个社今年秋播计划和国家计划相比，小麦面积减少了20％，油料面积相差40％，而洋芋面积却增多了50％多。讨论就是从“为什么完不成国家计划”入手，进而转向“国家计划同农民的关系”。
    讨论深入下去以后，有的提出，多种小麦，国家要征购，多种了洋芋，都是归自己。有的还提出，连油都买不到，还种油料作物干啥？这些问题暴露了社员中本位主义严重，不了解国家计划和农民的关系。经过讨论，大家明确的认识到：农业不支援工业，就别想工业支援农业。服从国家计划，是有利国家，有益农民；自由种植，使国家受了损失，也害了自己。至于食油供应不足，经过讨论，大家知道主要是生产太少，赶不上消费需要。就拿社里的情况来说，办社以前，全村要收二十多石油料，可是去年只收了二石多。
    在社员群众提高思想认识以后，社管会决定全面完成国家分配的一千一百多亩粮食和油料种植面积计划。
