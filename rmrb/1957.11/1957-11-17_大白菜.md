    Chinese Cabbage

    Chinese cabbage is the most important vegetable in northern China during the winter. It is not only tender and juicy but also rich in nutrients. In addition to minerals like calcium, phosphorus, and iron, it also contains Vitamin B1 (thiamine), B2 (riboflavin), nicotinic acid, and a large amount of Vitamin C (ascorbic acid, about 24-30 milligrams per 100 grams).

    Chinese cabbage is very resistant to storage and can be preserved for as long as four months in low-temperature, ventilated cellars. In addition, it can also be made into sauerkraut and pickled cabbage for preservation.

    There are many ways to eat Chinese cabbage. However, it is worth noting that people generally prefer to cook it for a long time, but braised cabbage retains fewer vitamins than stir-fried cabbage or hot and sour cabbage.

    The following is a method for making sauerkraut:

    Sauerkraut is a pickled product made through lactic acid fermentation and is widely popular in various parts of northern China. The method is as follows: When the Chinese cabbage is harvested in November, choose fat cabbage heads with firm hearts, peel off the old outer leaves, wash them clean, and then cut them lengthwise into sections, each weighing about one or two pounds. Blanch the cabbage in boiling water for one minute until it becomes soft and translucent. Remove and cool in cold water. Then, layer them alternately in a crock, with a stone placed on top. Add cold water to cover the cabbage by about three inches. After twenty days, it can be eaten. Sauerkraut should be stored in a place below 15°C and needs to be replenished with fresh water frequently, so it can be preserved for four to five months. Sauerkraut has a slightly sour and crisp taste, and it is most delicious when cooked with meat. Dishes such as stir-fried sauerkraut with shredded pork, sauerkraut and sliced pork soup, and sauerkraut and sliced pork hot pot are all unique in flavor. (Zuo Dazhen)

    大白菜
    大白菜是我国北方冬季最主要的蔬菜。大白菜不仅鲜嫩多汁，并且营养丰富。它除了含有钙、磷、铁等矿物质以外，还含有维生素B2
  （硫胺素）、B2（核黄素）、尼克酸以及大量维生素C
  （即抗坏血酸，每百克约含24—30毫克左右）。
    大白菜很耐储藏，在低温通风的土窖中可以保存四个月之久。此外，大白菜还可以制成酸白菜、腌白菜加以保藏。
    大白菜的吃法很多。但值得注意的是，一般人喜欢吃熬白菜，而熬白菜比炒白菜和酸辣白菜所保存的维生素都要少。
    下面介绍一种酸白菜的做法：
    酸白菜是经过乳酸发酵而成的腌渍品，在我国北方各地，广泛流行。做法如下：在十一月大白菜收获时，选择菜棵肥硕，包心坚实的大白菜，剥去老菜帮，洗净后，纵切成瓣，每瓣约重一、二斤左右；把白菜放在开水中热烫一分钟，这时白菜变得柔软、透亮，捞出后放在冷水中冷却；然后一层层交错地平铺在瓦缸中，上面压一石块；再加入冷水，使水盖过白菜约三寸，二十天后即可食用。酸白菜应该放在温度15°以下的地方，并需经常补充清水，这样可以保存四、五个月。酸白菜味微酸而清脆，与肉类混合烹调最为可口。如酸白菜炒肉丝，酸白菜肉片汤，酸白菜肉片涮锅等都别具风味。  （左大珍）
