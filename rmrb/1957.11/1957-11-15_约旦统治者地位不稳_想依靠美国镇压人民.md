Xinhua News Agency, November 14th dispatch from Cairo: According to a report on the 13th by the "Republic" newspaper's correspondent in New York, King Hussein of Jordan once sent a special envoy to deliver a letter to U.S. President Eisenhower, requesting the U.S. to send the Sixth Fleet to the Eastern Mediterranean to support the tottering Jordanian ruling clique.

The newspaper also said that Hussein had obtained three million U.S. dollars from the U.S. Embassy in Jordan to strengthen his army.

The "Al-Ahram" newspaper's correspondent in Washington reported on the same day that Hussein had requested support from King Faisal of Iraq. The newspaper quoted a diplomatic source familiar with the situation as saying that Hussein and Faisal had reached an agreement that as long as Hussein gave the order, Iraqi troops would immediately enter Jordan to control the situation. However, an Iraqi government spokesman denied this news.

According to a Cairo radio report on the 12th, King Hussein of Jordan, feeling that his throne was tottering, had transferred more than two million U.S. dollars to banks in Switzerland, Tunisia, Iraq and other countries.

According to news from Amman, King Hussein of Jordan said at a press conference on the 13th that, according to the U.S. decision to provide military aid to Jordan, Jordan will receive more arms from the United States.

In view of the fact that the Jordanian government's current policy of relying on the United States has been met with increasingly fierce opposition from the people at home, Hussein has had to verbally state that Jordan should pursue a policy of active neutrality, not participate in any form of military treaty or agreement, and not accept aid with strings attached. But at the same time, he described the U.S. aid, which is aimed at buying Jordan's independence and sovereignty, as "unconditional help."

Hussein groundlessly slandered Egypt and Syria, insisting that Egypt and Syria are so-called "tools of international communism."

    约旦统治者地位不稳
    想依靠美国镇压人民
    新华社14日讯　开罗消息：据“共和国报”驻纽约记者13日报道，约旦国王侯赛因曾经派一个特使送一封信给美国总统艾森豪威尔，要求美国把第六舰队派到东地中海去支持摇摇欲坠的约旦统治集团。
    这家报纸还说，侯赛因已经从美国驻约旦大使馆取得了三百万美元来加强他的军队。
    “金字塔报”驻华盛顿记者同一天报道，侯赛因曾经要求伊拉克国王费萨尔给予支持。这家报纸引用一位了解情况的外交界人士的话说，侯赛因和费萨尔之间已经达成协议，只要侯赛因下命令，伊拉克军队就立即开进约旦去控制局势。但是，伊拉克政府发言人否认这个消息。
    据开罗电台12日报道，约旦国王由于感到他的王位摇摇欲坠，已经把二百多万美元转存到瑞士、突尼斯、伊拉克等国的银行。
    据安曼消息，约旦国王侯赛因13日在记者招待会上说，根据美国对约旦提供军事援助的决定，约旦将从美国得到更多的军火。
    鉴于约旦政府目前投靠美国的政策遭到国内人民愈来愈激烈的反对，侯赛因不得不在口头上表示，约旦要奉行积极中立政策，不参加任何形式的军事条约或协定，不接受附带条件的援助。但同时他又把旨在收买约旦的独立和主权的美援说成是“不附带条件的帮助”。
    侯赛因对埃及和叙利亚进行毫无根据的谩骂，硬说埃及和叙利亚是所谓“国际共产主义的工具”。
