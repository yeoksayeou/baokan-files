Czechoslovak Newspapers

    Xinhua News Agency, Prague, November 25th. Czechoslovak newspapers continue to publish editorials and articles commenting on the two declarations adopted by the Communist and Workers' Parties representatives at the Moscow conference.

    "Red Right" published an editorial on the "Peace Declaration" on the 24th, saying that the communist movement has fought from the beginning for lasting peace and for the abolition of war as a means of resolving international disputes. This struggle has never happened before in human history. Socialism opposes and condemns aggressive war, considering it a crime against humanity and a tool for imperialist blackmail of one country against another.

    The newspaper continued: We are proud that our people, our working class, under the leadership of the Communist Party, firmly stand at the forefront of socialism and world peace. The militant and inspiring words of the Peace Declaration will be heard throughout our country. Undoubtedly these words will be fully understood.

Bulgarian Newspapers

    Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, November 25th. Bulgarian newspapers published editorials on the 24th, commenting on the Peace Declaration adopted by the Representatives Conference of the Communist and Workers' Parties.

    The "Workers' Cause" editorial pointed out that the Peace Declaration is a historically significant document of the great unity of communists in all countries of the world. It inspires Bulgarian communists and all patriots, making them more vigilant, more united, and more courageous in the struggle against the enemies of peace.

    In emphasizing that the conspiracies of imperialist aggressors are opposed by powerful forces of peace, the newspaper wrote that a growing and powerful mass peace movement exists, and the people of Europe and other capitalist countries are increasingly strongly and resolutely opposing imperialist military plans. The working class and its vanguard, the Communist Party, are powerful organizational and leading forces in the struggle for peace. In order to stop the war, all good people must unite and increase their vigilance against the schemes of warmongers.

    The "Workers' Cause" editorial also emphasized that peace in the Balkans, Europe, and the world must be consolidated and guaranteed.

Polish Newspapers

    Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, November 25th. The Polish "People's Tribune" published an editorial on the 24th, commenting on the "Peace Declaration" of the Representatives Conference of the Communist and Workers' Parties of various countries.

    The editorial said that the Representatives Conference of the Communist and Workers' Parties discussed the urgent issues in the current international situation and formulated a program to strengthen the struggle for peace. Today, the forces of peace are very strong, and there is a real possibility to stop the war. The Western countries' aggressive bloc's calculations on military superiority have failed. Today, in many aspects, it is not the Soviet Union that should catch up with the West, but the West that should catch up with the Soviet Union.

    The "People's Tribune" emphasized that the most important task for communists in the entire struggle to maintain and consolidate peace is to unite all forces against war. The Communist and Workers' Parties that signed the "Peace Declaration" will do their best to make their propositions the propositions of the broadest masses of the people in their respective countries and to ensure that these propositions have a full impact on the policies of their respective governments. This will help accelerate the victory of the cause of peace.

All newspapers published editorials on the 24th commenting on the "Peace Declaration".

    The "People's Voice" wrote that the Peace Declaration penetrates into the hearts and consciousness of good people. It deals a fatal blow to the imperialist propaganda that attempts to force the people of all countries to accept the idea that a so-called new war is inevitable. The "Peace Declaration" declares that war is not inevitable and that peace can be defended and consolidated. What a powerful call. This is a profound belief based on the Marxist-Leninist analysis of the modern situation and the new balance of power on the international stage. The declaration of the Communist and Workers' Parties mobilizes all people in the world to rise up and struggle for the lofty ideal, giving them bright hope for a better future. The Albanian communists and all the people who have suffered from the ravages of war and are now successfully building socialism fully support the Peace Declaration. They will continue to vigilantly defend peace and the interests of the people, and oppose the conspiracy of the aggressors to launch a new world war.
