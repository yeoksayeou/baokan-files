    Liu Ying's Murderer
    Shan Yinchang Sentenced to Death
    Xinhua News Agency: Shan Yinchang, the murderer who personally killed Liu Ying, the former Secretary of the CPC Min-Zhe Border Region Provincial Committee and the CPC Zhejiang Provincial Committee, and actively participated in the persecution of Yu Zisan, the chairman of the Student Union of Zhejiang University, has been sentenced to death and executed on the 25th in Dongyang County, Zhejiang Province. Prior to the execution, the Dongyang County People's Court held a sentencing rally attended by more than 10,000 people.
    From 1940, Shan served successively as an action member of the action team of the investigation and statistics office of the Zhejiang Provincial Kuomintang Party Department and the captain of the "political prisoner reception center" until the eve of liberation.
    On May 18, 1942, Shan and special agents Chen Jiabi and others personally murdered Liu Ying, the Secretary of the CPC Min-Zhe Border Region Provincial Committee and the CPC Zhejiang Provincial Committee, in Fangyan, Yongkang County. After murdering Liu Ying, Shan received a large amount of material rewards from the Kuomintang government.
    In the spring of 1948, Shan actively participated in monitoring and persecuting Yu Zisan, the chairman of the Student Union of Zhejiang University, and arrested this patriotic young man. Soon, Yu Zisan was killed by the enemy. On the eve of liberation, Shan fled to Ningbo and actively participated in counter-revolutionary activities, extensively searching for and killing revolutionary workers, and attempting to lie dormant and continue to carry out counter-revolutionary sabotage activities in areas such as the Wenzhou coast. However, due to the vigilance of the broad masses of people after liberation, his conspiracy ultimately failed. Later, Shan concealed his historical crimes and hid in his native Dongyang County. During the suppression of counter-revolutionaries in 1955, Shan was finally arrested by the public security organs after being exposed by the masses.

    杀害刘英的凶手
    单银昌被处死刑
    新华社讯　曾亲手杀害前中共闽浙边区省委、中共浙江省委书记刘英和积极参与迫害浙江大学学生会主席于子三的凶手单银昌，已被判处死刑，25日在浙江省东阳县执行。在执行以前，东阳县人民法院召开了有一万多人参加的宣判大会。
    单犯从1940年起，曾历任浙江省国民党党部调查统计室行动队行动员和“政治犯接待所”队长等职，直到解放前夕。
    1942年5月18日，单犯和特务陈家璧等三人在永康县方岩地方亲手杀害了中共闽浙边区省委、中共浙江省委书记刘英。单犯在杀害刘英以后，曾受到国民党政府给予的大批物质奖励。
    1948年春天，单犯又积极参与监视和迫害浙江大学学生会主席于子三的活动，并逮捕了这位爱国志士，不久于子三就遭到敌人杀害。解放前夕，单犯逃到宁波，又积极参加反革命活动，大肆搜捕和杀害革命工作人员，并企图潜伏下来，到温州沿海等地区继续进行反革命破坏活动。但是，由于解放后广大人民提高了警惕性，他的阴谋终未得逞。后来，单犯就隐瞒历史罪恶，匿居在原籍东阳县。1955年肃清反革命运动中，由群众检举，单犯终于被公安机关逮捕。
