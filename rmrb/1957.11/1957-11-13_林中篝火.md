    Bonfire in the Forest
    Yan Chen
    The night is so gentle and quiet, tightly enveloping the primeval forest of the Xing'an Mountains. The coniferous trees exude a charming fragrance, and you can hear the sound of falling leaves. A blazing bonfire burns in a clearing in the forest, like a cluster of bright roses suddenly blooming on a May night. Birch wood crackles, and the bonfire burns even more vigorously. It illuminates the faces of the forest survey team members and shines on the unwavering friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people. It is already very late at night, but no one wants to go to sleep. Many stories of struggle embrace hearts that are equally sincere.
    Second, the Heilongjiang River, your green carpet, gently spreads out on the road of friendship. You nourish the vast Siberia and irrigate the fertile North Manchurian plains. How many Chinese soldiers have been buried in the land of Siberia, to defend the young Soviet regime and to realize a beautiful ideal. In the grasslands and forests of North Manchuria, the heroic footprints of the Soviet Red Army remain. Golden wheat waves sway in the breeze, and towering memorial towers are surrounded by white clouds. The bonfire gently jumps, like the blood of the martyrs flowing. The young survey team members will always remember those shining examples.
    Third, what is burning in the eyes of the forest survey team leader who once served in the Anti-Japanese Allied Army? The bonfire rises vigorously, like the Kremlin's red star shining. Yes, in this forest clearing, the Anti-Japanese Allied Army once camped. At the foot of the mountain, the clear stream still echoes with the magnificent songs of that time. Our Soviet expert tells the story of his struggle behind enemy lines. The bonfire rises vigorously, like the red flag that surpasses the morning sun. Snow up to the shins, violent winds, grip the guns even tighter. The clamor of the Ukrainian forest, like music, stirs in his heart.
    Fourth, tonight, in Red Square and in front of Tiananmen Square, magnificent flowers bloom in the sky. The bonfire, too, dances excitedly, echoing the fireworks in the capital. To celebrate the great festival, we must awaken the sleeping forest. The young must grow up quickly, and the old must quickly join the construction army. Birch wood crackles, and the bonfire burns even more vigorously. It illuminates the faces of the forest survey team members and shines on the unwavering friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people. It is already very late at night, but no one wants to go to sleep. Many beautiful hopes embrace hearts that are equally sincere.

    林中篝火
    严辰
    一夜这样温柔这样安静，紧紧地包围着兴安岭的原始森林，针叶树散发出迷人的气息，你能听到落叶堕地的声音。一堆熊熊的篝火，燃烧在林中空地上，仿佛一簇鲜艳的玫瑰，在五月之夜忽然开放。桦木毕毕剥剥爆裂，篝火更加旺盛地燃起，它照红了森林调查队员的脸，照亮了中苏两国人民不渝的友谊。这时候夜已经很深，可是谁也不想去睡觉，许多战斗的故事，把同样赤诚的心拥抱。
    二黑龙江，你绿色的地毯，在友谊的路上轻轻铺展，你滋润着广阔的西伯利亚，也灌溉了富庶的北满草原。西伯利亚的土地上，曾有多少中国战士埋葬，为了保卫年青的苏维埃，为了实现美好的理想。在北满的草原、山林，留下了苏联红军英勇的脚印，金色的麦浪在微风中摆动，巍峨的纪念塔缭绕着白云。篝火轻轻跳跃，如同先烈们的热血在流淌，年青的调查队员们，永远记得那些光辉的榜样。
    三曾当过抗日联军的森调队长呵，是什么在你眼睛里燃烧？篝火旺盛地升起，就像克里姆林的红星在闪耀。是的，就在这林中空地上，驻扎过抗日联军的野营，山脚下那清清的溪流上还响彻着当年雄壮的歌声。我们的苏联专家，讲述他敌后斗争的事迹，篝火旺盛地升起，就像那面赛过朝阳的红旗。没胫的雪，狂暴的风，更紧地握住手中的枪，乌克兰森林的喧哗，乐曲一样在他心里激荡。
    四今夜，在红场和天安门前，天空里开放起绚烂的花朵，篝火呵，也兴奋地舞蹈，呼应着首都的焰火。为了庆祝伟大的节日，要把沉睡的森林唤醒，年幼的赶快成长，年长的快去参加建设大军。桦木毕毕剥剥爆裂，篝火更加旺盛地燃起，它照红了森林调查队员的脸，照亮了中苏两国人民不渝的友谊。这时候夜已经很深，可是谁也不想去睡觉，许多美丽的希望，把同样赤诚的心拥抱。
