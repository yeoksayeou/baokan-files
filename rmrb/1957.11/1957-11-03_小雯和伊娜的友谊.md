The Friendship of Xiaowen and Ina

These days, a little girl named Xiaowen in Lüda City is particularly excited, because the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution is coming soon, and she is preparing to write a letter to her best Soviet friend, Ina!

Ina's father is a Soviet military officer. In 1954, Ina came to Lüda City with her parents. At that time, she happened to be neighbors with Xiaowen's family, and these two children of similar age became close friends. During the year or so they spent together, Xiaowen learned some Russian, and Ina also learned a few words of Chinese. They often played together, as close as sisters. Later, when the Soviet army withdrew from Lüda, Ina and Xiaowen separated. After the separation, these two children missed each other. On the eve of the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution, Xiaowen missed Ina even more. (Attached picture)

Xiaowen is preparing to write a letter to Ina to congratulate her. But where to start? She has to ask her mother for help. The photo in the upper left corner was taken when she and Ina were together.

Xiaowen will not forget Ina, and often takes out the gifts Ina gave her to show to her friends.

    小雯和伊娜的友谊
    这些天来，旅大市一个叫小雯的小女孩子的心情特别激动，因为十月革命四十周年就快来到了，她正在准备给她最要好的一个苏联小朋友伊娜写信呢！
    伊娜的爸爸是个苏军军官。1954年伊娜随她的父母来到旅大市，当时正好和小雯家是邻居，这两个年龄相仿的小孩子就结成了亲密的朋友。在她们相处一年多的日子里，小雯学会了一些俄语，伊娜也学会了几句中国话，她们常在一起玩，亲如姐妹。后来在苏军撤离旅大时，伊娜和小雯分别了，别后这两个小朋友都互相挂念着。在这十月革命四十周年的前夕，小雯就更想念伊娜。（附图片）
    小雯正准备给伊娜写封信，向她祝贺。但从何处写起呢？还得请妈妈帮助。左上角的一张照片是当年她和伊娜在一起时拍摄的。
    小雯念念不忘伊娜，常常把伊娜送给她的礼物拿出来给小朋友们看。
