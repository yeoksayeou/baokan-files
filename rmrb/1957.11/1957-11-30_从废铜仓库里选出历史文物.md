Historical Relics Selected from Scrap Copper Warehouse

    The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Culture's Relics Sorting Warehouse recently identified and selected a batch of historical relics from the scrap copper warehouse of the China National Hardware and Machinery Corporation. Among them is a ding cauldron with a turtle pattern from the late Western Zhou Dynasty. The top of the legs is decorated with frog-shaped patterns, which is rare on bronze cauldrons. There is also a pair of copper cymbals with thirty-four characters on the cymbals: "Wuwei Army Kunshan Guangde Zen Temple, made on the 28th day of the fourth month of Qingyuan three years, one pair of cymbals, Bao Ding character number, officially engraved, Supervisor (followed by a monogram)." This was made during the reign of Emperor Ningzong of the Southern Song Dynasty (Qingyuan three years is 1197 AD), and is important material for studying Song Dynasty musical instruments. In addition, there are more than one hundred Zhou Dynasty weapons, ge halberds, and arrowheads. Among them, one arrowhead is single-winged and has a ring for attaching a rope, which is also extremely rare. There are also Eastern Zhou Dynasty chariot parts, paring knives, chisels, axes, shovels, bronze seals from the Han and Wei dynasties, bronze irons, bronze plowshares, small Buddha statues, fragments of gilded firearms, yokes with the inscriptions "Huaayin Prefecture," "Huaian," etc. with the Yuan Dade reign mark, Yuan dynasty seals, and other bronze ware from various eras, totaling more than two hundred pieces.

    从废铜仓库里选出历史文物
    上海市文化局文物整理仓库，最近在中国五金机械公司废铜仓库中，鉴选出一批历史文物。其中有一个西周晚期的黾纹鼎，足上端作蛙形花纹，这种纹式在铜鼎上是少见的。另有一对铜钹，钹上有“无为军昆山广德禅寺，庆元三年四月二十八日钹一副，保丁字号，已当官镌讫，监官（末尾有一花押）”三十四个字，这是南宋宁宗（庆元三年为公元1197年）时造的，是研究宋代乐器的重要材料。此外，还有周代的兵器、戈和箭头等一百多件，其中有一个箭头是单翼，有环可以系绳，这也是极为少见的。另外尚有东周时代的车器，削、凿、斧、铲、汉魏公朝的铜印、铜熨斗、铜犁头、小佛像、残鎏金铳，元大德年款的“淮阴州”，“淮安”等字样的杈、元押，以及其他各时代的铜器，共两百余件。　（孙桂恩）
