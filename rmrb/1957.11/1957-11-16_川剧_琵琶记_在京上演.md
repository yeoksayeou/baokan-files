    Sichuan Opera "Pipa Ji" Performed in Beijing
    On the evenings of November 13th, 14th, and 15th, the Chongqing Sichuan Opera Theatre performed "Pipa Ji," one of the four major high-pitched operas of Sichuan Opera, at the Chang'an Theatre in Beijing for the capital's audience. The complete "Pipa Ji" had not been staged for over twenty years; only excerpts were frequently performed. This time, they performed twenty-three scenes from "Cai Gong Forcing the Examination" to "Inscribing the Stele and Three Strikes," mostly based on the oral versions of veteran artists. The storyline is basically the same as Gao Zecheng's original work, and it tries to maintain the original appearance as much as possible. This performance of "Pipa Ji" has received widespread attention from the literary and art circles and the audience in the capital. The Sichuan Opera Theatre intends to listen to opinions from all parties as a reference for future revisions. (Yun)

    川剧“琵琶记”在京上演
    本月13、14、15日晚上，重庆市川剧院在北京长安戏院为首都的观众连续演出了川戏高腔四大本之一的“琵琶记”。全本“琵琶记”已有二十多年未曾上演过，经常上演的只是其中几个折子戏。这次他们演出的是从“蔡公逼试”到“刻碑三打”的二十三折，大多是根据老艺人的口述本整理的，故事情节和高则诚的原著基本相同，并尽量保持了原来的面貌。这次演出的“琵琶记”，受到了首都文艺界和观众广泛的重视。川剧院准备听取各方面的意见，作为今后继续整理时的参考。（匀）
