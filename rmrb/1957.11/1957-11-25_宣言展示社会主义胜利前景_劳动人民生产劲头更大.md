Xinhua News Agency, 24th: The two great declarations, marking the development of the world communist movement and the movement to defend world peace entering a new and important stage, inspire the vast working people's enthusiasm for building socialism and their determination to defend peace.

    At the Anshan Iron and Steel Company, more than forty workers and technicians held a forum on these two declarations on the 24th. Wang Chonglun, a famous labor model and deputy director of the Ansteel Youth Tool Workshop, said: After reading the declaration of the meeting of representatives of communist and workers' parties of socialist countries, I felt that the socialist forces are extremely strong. Lang Yunzhi, an excavator expert who excavated more than 540,000 cubic meters of earth in four years and nine months, said: Our excavator operators must use practical actions of hard work to support these two declarations. During the Second Five-Year Plan, I guarantee to excavate one million cubic meters of earth. In the past two days, the two declarations have caused a sensation in various workshops and functional departments of the Changchun First Automobile Manufacturing Plant. On the 24th, the factory's employees held a forum. The employees pointed out that these two declarations will play an immeasurable role in further strengthening the unity of the working people of the world, and expressed their support. In factories such as the Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Plant and the Harbin Boiler Plant, these two declarations were also warmly welcomed and supported by the employees.

    After reading these two declarations, some members of the Nandayuan Vegetable Production Cooperative in the suburbs of Baoding City were overjoyed and strengthened their confidence in building a new socialist countryside. The Party organization of the agricultural cooperative decided to lead all the cooperative cadres and members to study these two declarations extensively within a week.

    In Fuzhou, the worker representatives from various places who had just concluded the Third Congress of the Fujian Provincial Federation of Trade Unions discussed the profound content of the declarations with infinite excitement. Ren Chenggen, a national advanced producer and worker at the Jianyang Repair Shop, said: The closer the more than 950 million people, who account for more than one-third of the world's population, are united, the more panicked the imperialist warmongers will be. We must use practical actions of working hard and creating more wealth for the country to continuously strengthen the strength of the socialist camp.

    On the 23rd, the political department of the leading organ of the Fujian Front troops of the Chinese People's Liberation Army notified the troops under its jurisdiction to organize officers and soldiers to conscientiously study these two declarations and related communiqués.
