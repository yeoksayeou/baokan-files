    Three Volumes of "Collection of Translations of Dramatic Theory"
    This collection is compiled by the China Drama Publishing House with the aim of timely introducing important foreign works and materials related to drama for the reference of Chinese drama workers. It is planned to compile and print one volume every two to three months, using the title of one of the articles as the title of the book. Three volumes have already been printed: the first volume "Analyzing Scripts and Roles in Action," the second volume "On Director's Conception," and the third volume "On Craftsmanship." Each volume contains approximately 150,000 words.
    These three volumes focus on introducing the theatrical theories of Soviet dramatists. "On Craftsmanship" is Stanislavsky's posthumous work, in which the author elaborates on important insights into the art of acting. Knipel's "Analyzing Scripts and Roles in Action" and Toporkov's "The Unity of Psycho-Physical Actions" are both articles explaining the important principles of the Stanislavsky system. The author of "On Director's Conception" discusses the formation process of the director's conception and its importance in performance through his own artistic practice experience.
    These three volumes also translated and published more important articles from the discussion on the application and development of the Stanislavsky system launched by the Soviet drama circles last year, and translated some articles that are very valuable for studying Soviet drama history.
    This collection also attaches importance to the introduction of dramas from other countries, so each volume also translates articles on the dramas of Germany, Italy, Egypt, Japan, India, and Burma.
    The fourth volume, "Stage Management," will be published at the end of this month. Important articles in this volume include: "Stage Management," "Khmelyov's Acting Art," "The Road to Creating Stage Self-Feeling," "Director's Instructions for 'The Mistress of the Inn'," and "Stage Scenery," etc. (Guang)

    三辑“戏剧理论译文集”
    这个集子是中国戏剧出版社编译的，目的是及时介绍外国有关戏剧方面的重要论著和资料，供我国戏剧工作者参考，计划每两三个月编印一册，以其中一篇文章的题目作为书名，现已印行三辑：第一辑“在动作中分析剧本和角色”，第二辑“论导演构思”，第三辑“论匠艺”；每辑约十五万字。
    这三辑着重介绍了苏联戏剧家的演剧理论。“论匠艺”一文是斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基的遗著，作者在其中发挥了演剧艺术上的重要见解。克尼别尔的“在动作中分析剧本和角色”、托波尔科夫的“心理形体行动的统一”，都是阐释斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基体系重要原理的文章。“论导演构思”一文作者通过自己的艺术实践经验，论述了导演构思形成过程及其在演出方面的重要意义。
    在这三辑里还译载了苏联戏剧界去年以来展开的关于斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基体系的运用和发展问题的讨论中较重要的文章，并译了一些对于研究苏联戏剧史很有参考价值的文章。
    这个文集也重视对其他各国戏剧的介绍，所以各辑中也译载了关于德国、意大利、埃及、日本、印度和缅甸等国戏剧的文章。
    本月底，第四辑“舞台调度”即将出版。这一辑的重要文章有：“舞台调度”、“赫梅辽夫的演剧艺术”、“创造舞台自我感觉的道路”、“‘女店主’导演说明”和“舞台布景”等文。（广）
