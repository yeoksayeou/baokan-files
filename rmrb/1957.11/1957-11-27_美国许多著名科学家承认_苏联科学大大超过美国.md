Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 26th: Prominent American scientists have admitted that the Soviet Union has surpassed the United States in important aspects of science and technology.

The Senate Armed Services Committee began an investigation on the 25th into the United States' lag behind the Soviet Union in missiles. The main witness at the hearing was Dr. Teller, the famous scientist hailed as the "father of the American atomic bomb," who analyzed the various ways in which the Soviet Union surpasses the United States in science.

Teller pointed out that the speed of Soviet scientific development is "much higher than the speed of American scientific development," and that the scope of Soviet scientific progress is "extremely broad." He said that since the war, the Soviet Union has been faster and more efficient than the United States in applying technology to all aspects of missile systems. If the Soviet Union continues to maintain this speed, then "undoubtedly, in a few more years, it will leave the United States far, far behind."

Teller said that the Soviet Union is now capable of hitting a distant target like Houston, Texas, in the United States with intercontinental missiles. The Soviet Union's launching of artificial satellites shows that it has made great progress in the development of rockets. To go to the moon, "the Soviet Union already has all the technical basis for doing so."

Teller said that the Soviet Union is also ahead of the United States in high-energy physics (one of the most expensive aspects of scientific research). The Soviet Union has completed a machine in this area that is "better than any such machine in the world." As for the development of bombers, radar, and other aspects, the Soviet Union "obviously knows as much as the United States."

Teller predicted that in the next ten years, the Soviet Union could also control the weather, but the United States may still often suffer from droughts and be unable to control the weather.

Teller said that the Soviet Union has caught up with the United States in science because "the Soviet Union is working harder than the United States," and he expressed his respect for the Soviet Union's scientific achievements.

Previously, Teller had estimated that, due to the progress of the Soviet Union, it would take the United States at least ten years to catch up with the Soviet Union in science.

Another prominent American scientist, Bush, who testified at the same meeting, agreed with Teller's statement. He specifically pointed out that the Soviet Union's launch of artificial satellites shows that it has solved the major problems of intercontinental missiles. U.S. Army Secretary Bruck admitted on the 24th that the United States still has many problems to solve in the "trial production" of intercontinental missiles.

Senator Johnson, the Democratic leader of the Senate who presided over the investigation, said at the hearing that the Soviet Union's launch of two artificial satellites had caused the United States to suffer "defeat." He said that the United States had "lost to" the Soviet Union "in an important battle in the field of technology."

Astronomer Whipple also pointed out the fact that the Soviet Union surpassed the United States in science at the Associated Press Managing Editors Association on the 23rd. He said that the important point about artificial satellites is that the Soviet Union's "speed of progress is greater than the speed of progress in the United States." He said that the Soviet Union is currently training scientists and technicians twice as fast as the United States, and unless the United States takes "drastic steps," the Soviet Union will go far ahead of the United States in science.

Senator Gore said on the 22nd that the United States is not only behind in artificial satellites, but according to qualified experts' estimates, "the United States is five years behind in the development of air-cooled natural uranium reactors for power generation." He said that the Soviet Union is building large-scale nuclear power plants, while the United States only has "a small experimental reactor."

Now, many people in the United States believe that they should learn from the Soviet Union in science. Ott, who presides over the Russian translation program of the National Science Foundation, advocated on the 25th to translate more Soviet scientific publications. Carter, dean of the Stanford University Graduate School, said that the United States must change its view and accept the scientific achievements of other countries, especially those of the Soviet Union.

### 美国许多著名科学家承认  苏联科学大大超过美国

    美国许多著名科学家承认
    苏联科学大大超过美国
    新华社26日讯　华盛顿消息：美国著名科学家承认，在科学技术的重要方面，苏联已经超过了美国。
    参议院军事委员会25日开始对美国在导弹方面落后于苏联一事进行调查。在作证会上的主要作证人是被誉为美国“原子弹之父”的著名科学家泰勒博士，他分析了苏联在科学方面胜过美国的种种情况。
    泰勒指出，苏联科学发展的速度“比美国科学的发展速度高得多”，而且苏联科学进展的面也“极其广泛”。他说，苏联战后在把技术用于导弹系统的一切方面都比美国做得速度快、效率高。如果苏联继续保持这样的速度，那么“无疑再过几年就会把美国抛在后面、远远的后面”。
    泰勒说，苏联现在已经能够用洲际导弹击中像美国得克萨斯州豪斯敦这样一个遥远的目标。苏联发射人造卫星一事表明，苏联在火箭的发展方面有很大进展。要到月球去，“苏联已经有这样做的一切技术基础了”。
    泰勒说，苏联在高能物理学（科学研究最花钱的一个方面）也走在美国的前头。苏联在这方面完成了一种“比世界上任何这类机器都要好”的机器。至于轰炸机、雷达和其他的发展方面，苏联“显然同美国知道的一样多”。
    泰勒预料，在今后十年内，苏联还可以控制天气，但美国却可能仍然常常闹旱灾，无法控制天气。
    泰勒说，苏联在科学方面赶上美国是因为“苏联比美国努力”，他对苏联的科学成就表示尊敬。
    在这以前，泰勒曾经估计，由于苏联的进步，美国目前最少要十年的时间才能在科学方面追上苏联。
    在同一个会议上作证的著名美国科学家布希同意泰勒的说法。他特别指出，苏联发射人造卫星说明了它已经解决了洲际导弹的各种重大问题。而美国陆军部长布鲁克24日承认，对于“试制”洲际导弹，美国目前还有许多问题没有解决。
    主持这个调查的参议院民主党领袖约翰逊在作证会议上说，苏联发射了两颗人造卫星已经使美国吃了“败仗”。他说，“在技术方面的一场重要战斗中”，美国已经“输给”苏联了。
    天文学家惠普耳23日在美联社主编协会上也指出了苏联在科学方面超过美国的事实。他说，关于人造卫星的重要之点在于苏联的“进步的速度比美国的进步速度大”。他说，苏联目前培养科学家和技术家的速度比美国快一倍，除非美国采取“激烈的步骤”，苏联在科学方面将远远走在美国的前头。
    参议员戈尔22日说，美国不仅在人造卫星方面落后了，而且根据有资格的专家们估计，“美国在发展生产电力的气冷式天然铀反应堆方面已落后了五年”。他说，苏联正在建立大型的原子能发电厂，而美国只有“一个小型的实验性反应堆”。
    现在，美国已经有不少人认为应该在科学上好好向苏联学习。全国科学基金会主持俄文翻译计划的奥特25日主张多翻译苏联的科学刊物。史坦福大学研究院院长卡特说，美国要改变它的看法，接受其他国家的科学成就，特别是苏联的成就。
