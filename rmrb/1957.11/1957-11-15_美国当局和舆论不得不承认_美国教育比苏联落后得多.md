American Authorities and Public Opinion Forced to Admit That American Education is Much More Backward Than Soviet Education

    This newspaper reports that the American "Nation" weekly published an article on October 19th entitled "The Training of Scientists," analyzing the situation of the Soviet Union and the United States in training scientists. The author is Kenneth, the author of "Russia, the Last Emergent Giant." The article begins by saying, "The Soviet Union's victory in the race to launch the first man-made satellite is not surprising to those familiar with the development of the Soviet education system." He pointed out that in 1955, Soviet universities trained 126,000 scientists, of which 59,000 were in engineering. During the same period, the United States only had 59,000 scientists graduate, of which only 22,589 were in engineering. The author says, "In recent years, the number of practical scientists trained in the Soviet Union has been rising sharply, while the number of practical scientists trained by us has decreased by 50% since 1950."

    The author quoted materials from the British "New Statesman and Nation" weekly, pointing out that even comparing the primary and secondary schools of the two countries, the Soviet Union surpasses the United States. "When a Soviet teenager completes his secondary education, he has a comprehensive education. ... His knowledge in mathematics and science is equivalent to that of a sophomore in an American college specializing in these subjects."

    In comparing the number of teachers in mathematics and science in the two countries, the author pointed out that "the number of teachers in the Soviet Union is much larger than that in the United States: there are 350,000 teachers in Soviet schools, while there are 130,000 to 140,000 in American schools. At the same time, the wages and status of Soviet teachers are also much higher than those in the United States.

    After praising the authority of teachers, strict discipline, and uniformity of curriculum and textbooks in Soviet schools, the author said: "If the motto of American schools is 'I believe in God,' then the motto of Soviet schools is 'I believe in science.'"

    The author wrote: "Although the training of scientific and technical personnel is a key task, it is not the only thing the Soviet Union emphasizes. They hope to have healthy, moral, educated, and loyal people. All kinds of extracurricular activities: literary, artistic, and scientific, have become a necessary part of school life, and special instructors are assigned to teach morality and etiquette."

    Finally, the author sadly believes that these things done by the Soviets cannot be done in the United States at all. The reason is: "Our society, our values, our government structure do not allow this to be done."

    Xinhua News Agency, New York, October 12th: According to TASS, after seeing the successful launch of two Soviet artificial earth satellites, the United States generally admits that the Soviet education system and the training of scientific and technological experts are superior to the American system.

    The U.S. Office of Education recently pointed out in a report on "Education in the Soviet Union": "In Russia, physics, natural science, and mathematics (including trigonometry and mapping) account for half of the teaching content in primary and secondary schools." The report believes that this is an advantage.

    The report mentioned that Soviet teachers enjoy "the greatest respect and prestige."

    The report also pointed out: "Soviet young men and women are encouraged by scholarships and technical school grants."

    The head of the Education Bureau, Derrick, said: "The report clearly points out that the Soviet government attaches great importance to the education system and fully supports this system."

    This report has aroused enthusiastic comments from American newspapers. "New York Times" reporter Fine wrote in commenting on the report: "Since 1927, the Soviet Union has achieved unimaginable achievements in all aspects of education... It is a pity for the United States that the report confirms that the Russians have achieved such achievements not only in the quality of education but also in quantity. Graduates of the Soviet ten-year system are more advanced than graduates of the American twelfth grade."

    Xinhua News Agency, New York, 14th: New York news: The American "New York Post" recently published an interview by the newspaper's columnist Wallace with former U.S. Senator Benton, entitled: "Why Can't American Schools Produce Scientists?"

    In answering Wallace's questions, Benton compared the education systems of the United States and the Soviet Union. He admitted that the Soviet education system is superior to the American system. He said, "The entire Russian education system is actually formulated according to much higher standards than ours." He also said that Soviet scientists receive the greatest respect and life care in society, while the United States "still very much despises intellectuals, it looks down on professors and scholars."

    When Wallace asked about the current situation of training teachers in the United States, Benton said that the United States does not train enough science teachers. In 1956, the United States only trained 125 new physics teachers for 28,000 middle schools across the country. 55% of American middle schools do not offer physics courses at all. According to a survey by the Princeton Institute, 80% of the mathematics teachers currently trained in the United States are unqualified. As a result, mathematics, which is the foundation of science, has become "the most troublesome course for middle school students in American schools."

    Benton believes that "unless we solve the problems of our education system at the beginning, we simply cannot solve the problems of American science." He believes that in this regard, "the United States is currently facing real danger."

### 美国当局和舆论不得不承认  美国教育比苏联落后得多

    美国当局和舆论不得不承认
    美国教育比苏联落后得多
    本报讯　美国“民族”周刊10月19日发表了一篇题为“科学家的训练”的文章，分析苏联和美国在培养科学家方面的情况。作者是“俄国，最后出现的巨人”一书的作者肯尼兹。文章一开始就说，“苏联在发射第一枚人造月亮的竞赛中的胜利，对熟悉苏联教育制度的发展的人说来，是不足为奇的。”他指出：1955年苏联高等学校培养了十二万六千名科学家，其中五万九千名是工程学方面的。同一时期美国只有五万九千名科学家毕业，其中只有二万二千五百八十九名是工程学方面的。作者说，“在最近几年中苏联培养的实用的科学家人数一直在急剧上升，而我们培养的实用科学家人数却在1950年后下降了50％。”
    作者引用英国“新政治家与民族”周刊的材料指出，即使以两国的小学和中学来比较，苏联也胜过美国。“一个苏联少年完成他的中等教育时，他具备了全面的教育。……他在数学和科学方面的知识相当于专修这些科目的一个美国学院二年级学生的知识。”
    在比较两国的数学和科学方面的教师人数时，作者指出“苏联的教师人数要比美国的大得多：苏联学校的教师是三十五万人，而美国学校是十三万人到十四万人。同时苏联教师的工资和地位也比美国高得多。
    作者在赞扬了苏联学校中教师的权威、严明的纪律和课程及教科书的划一后说：“如果美国学校的座右铭是‘我信上帝’，那么苏联学校的座右铭就是‘我信科学’”。
    作者又写道：“科学和技术人员的培养虽然是重点工作，然而并不是苏联唯一着重的事情。他们希望有健康的、道德的、有教养的、忠诚的人民。各式各样的课余活动：文学的、艺术的和科学的都已成为学校生活的必要部分，并且派有专门的指导员教导道德和礼貌。”
    最后作者悲哀地认为，苏联人所作的这些事，在美国根本作不到。原因是：“我们的社会、我们 的价值、我们的政府结构不许可这样作。”
    新华社13日讯　据塔斯社纽约12日讯：在看到苏联两颗人造地球卫星发射成功以后，美国普遍承认：苏联的教育制度和对科学技术专家的培养比美国制度优越。
    美国教育局最近在一个关于“苏联的教育”的报告中指出：“在俄国，物理、自然科学、数学（其中包括三角和制图）在小学和中学的教学分量中占一半。”报告认为，这是一个优点。
    报告谈到，苏联教师享有“最大的尊敬和威望”。
    报告还指出：“苏联的男女青年得到奖学金和技术学校助学金的鼓励。”
    教育局负责人德锡克说：“报告清楚地指出，苏联政府非常注重教育制度，并且全面地支持这个制度。”
    这个报告引起了美国报纸的热烈评论。“纽约时报”记者法因在评论这个报告时写道：“从1927年开始，苏联在教育各方面获得了难以想像的成就……这对美国来说是太可惜了，报告确认俄国人不仅在教育的质量上而且在数量上都取得了如此的成就。苏联十年制学校毕业生比美国十二年级的毕业生的程度要高。”
    新华社14日讯　纽约消息：美国“纽约邮报”最近刊载了该报专栏作家华莱斯访问美国前参议员本顿的谈话，题目是：“为什么美国学校产生不出科学家？”
    本顿在回答华莱斯的问题中比较了美国同苏联的教育制度。他承认，苏联的教育制度比美国优越。他说，“整个俄国的教育制度实际上是按照比我们高得多的标准拟订的”。他又说，苏联的科学家在社会上受到最大的尊敬和生活上的照顾，而美国“仍旧非常轻视知识分子，它瞧不起教授和学者”。
    当华莱斯问到目前美国培养教师的情况的时候，本顿说，美国的科学教员培养得不够。1956年美国全国为二万八千所中学只培养了一百二十五个新物理教员。美国55％的中学根本不开物理课。根据普林斯顿研究所的调查，目前美国培养出来的数学教员中有80％是不合格的，结果，作为科学的基础的数学成了“美国学校中学生最头痛的课程”。
    本顿认为，“除非我们在开头的时候解决我们的教育制度问题，否则我们简直是不能解决美国科学的问题的。”他认为，在这方面“目前美国面临着实在的危险”。
