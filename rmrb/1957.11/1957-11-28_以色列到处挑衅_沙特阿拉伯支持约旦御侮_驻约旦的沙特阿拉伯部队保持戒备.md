Xinhua News Agency, Amman, November 27th: Ahmed Kuhimi, the Saudi Arabian Chargé d'Affaires in Jordan, announced on November 26th that the Saudi Arabian troops stationed in Jordan had been ordered to remain on alert in order to support Jordan in the event of an Israeli attack.

Kuhimi said that he presented a letter from the Saudi King to Jordanian King Hussein on the 25th, in which the King guaranteed that Saudi Arabia was fully prepared to support Jordan if Israel attacked.

Jordanian Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Rifai also said at a press conference on the same day that both the Jordanian army and the Saudi Arabian troops stationed in Jordan had cancelled their leave and were on alert. He said that the Saudi Arabian troops in Jordan had been ordered to follow the command of King Hussein. Rifai's remarks were made in response to the recent tensions between Jordan and Israel caused by border incidents. Jordan has announced that it is prepared to lodge a complaint with the United Nations Security Council against Israel's attempt to smuggle gasoline into the Jerusalem demilitarized zone for military purposes and to build fortifications there. Reports say that two more shooting incidents occurred near the Israel-Jordan armistice line on the 26th.

Rifai said, "We are determined to defend our rights and defend our territory."

    以色列到处挑衅
    沙特阿拉伯支持约旦御侮
    驻约旦的沙特阿拉伯部队保持戒备
    据新华社27日讯　安曼消息：沙特阿拉伯驻约旦代办艾哈迈德·库赫米11月26日宣布，驻在约旦的沙特阿拉伯部队已经奉命保持戒备状态，以便在万一以色列进攻时支持约旦。
    库赫米说，他在25日晋见约旦国王侯赛因的时候递交了沙特国王的信件，信中保证，如果以色列进攻的话，沙特阿拉伯完全准备支持约旦。
    约旦副首相兼外交大臣里法伊同一天在记者招待会上也说，约旦军队和驻在约旦的沙特阿拉伯部队都已经取消了休假，处于戒备状态。他说，在约旦的沙特拉阿伯军队已经奉命听从侯赛因国王的指挥。里法伊的这番话是就约旦和以色列最近因边境事件而引起的紧张关系而说的。约旦已经宣布准备向联合国安全理事会控告以色列企图偷运汽油到耶路撒冷非军事区去用于军事目的，并且在那里修建防御工事。有消息说，在以色列—约旦停战线附近26日又发生了两次射击事件。
    里法伊说，“我们决心维护我们的权利并且保卫我们的领土”。
