    A Look Inside the American Legion
    In 1955, the American Legion, the largest veterans' organization in the United States and an extremely reactionary organization serving the interests of American monopolists, launched a membership expansion campaign. For two years, this infamous group has painstakingly tried to develop its organization, but contrary to its wishes, the American Legion's plan to expand its membership to five million has completely failed. Its current membership remains at 2.8 million, the same as before the start of the expansion campaign. Recently, a spokesman for the American Legion had to publicly admit: "The American Legion's membership situation is very unhealthy and depressing."
    The American Legion was founded in 1919, and it claims to be a non-political organization that works for the welfare of veterans. But these nice-sounding words cannot hide its ugly nature. There are countless examples of the American Legion acting as a pawn for monopolists. For example, in 1953, the American Legion Executive Committee passed a resolution in favor of American financial institutions raising interest rates on loans to veterans. This resolution, which directly affected the welfare of veterans, aroused deep dissatisfaction among veterans.
    The American Legion considers itself a non-political organization. In reality, however, it is a most reactionary political organization and a loyal lackey of McCarthyism. The American Legion constantly clamors to "extinguish communism and extinguish socialism." In the past year or two, the American Legion has been fully engaged in a movement against the United Nations. According to a recent report in the American magazine "The Nation," this movement is being secretly manipulated by an important figure in the American fascist organizations, the "American Restoration Party" and the "National Action Union."
    In fact, the American Legion's organization has already become fascist. The American Legion's policies and personnel are completely controlled by a small group of World War I veterans nicknamed "Regulars." They issue orders according to the wishes of the monopolists, and ordinary members have no freedom to express their opinions. In 1955, the American Legion appointed six members to conduct an investigation into "communist and anti-American activities" within the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). Due to the lack of evidence, the investigation report only made general attacks on UNESCO. The leaders of the American Legion were greatly dissatisfied, so the report was discarded, and a new report was jointly fabricated behind closed doors by the American Legion's Foreign Relations Committee and Americanism Committee. This is the "Report on the Dissemination of Subversive Educational Materials by UNESCO" published by the American Legion.
    The American Legion also has various affiliated organizations: the American Legion Auxiliary, which recruits the wives and children of veterans; and the Sons of the American Legion, which brings together the children and grandchildren of veterans. In addition, there are some affiliated committees that handle recreational activities: the so-called Forty and Eight, and the Eight and Forty. As the ugly nature of the American Legion is increasingly exposed, these affiliated organizations are also showing a tendency to disintegrate. Not long ago, the Forty and Eight announced its secession from the American Legion. The reason they announced was that the American Legion was controlled by a few people, and this group of people only took care of the interests of those who were manipulated by them.

    美国军团透视
    1955年，美国最大的退伍军人团体、为美国垄断资本家利益服务的极端反动的组织——美国军团发起了扩充会员的运动。两年以来，这个臭名昭彰的团体费尽心机发展组织，可是事与愿违，美国军团原定扩展会员至五百万名的计划已彻底破产。它的现有人数仍旧是扩展会员运动开始以前的二百八十万名。最近，美国军团的发言人不得不公开承认：“美国军团的会员情况非常不健康，而且令人沮丧。”
    美国军团是1919年成立的，它自命是为退伍军人谋福利的、非政治性的团体。但是这些好听的名词无法掩饰它的丑恶本质。美国军团充当垄断资本家走卒的实例是不胜枚举的。例如1953年，美国军团执行委员会竟通过一项议决案，赞成美国金融机构提高对退伍军人贷款的利率，这个直接影响退伍军人福利的议决案，曾经引起退伍军人深刻的不满。
    美国军团自认为是非政治性的团体。可是，实际上它是一个最反动的政治组织，它是麦卡锡主义的忠实走狗。美国军团不断地叫嚣要“扑灭共产主义、扑灭社会主义”。最近一两年，美国军团全力进行反对联合国的运动。据美国“民族”周刊最近透露，这个运动是由美国法西斯组织——“美国复兴党”、“民族行动联盟”的一个重要人物暗中操纵的。
    事实上，美国军团的组织早已法西斯化了。美国军团的政策与人事完全操纵在一小撮绰号为“正规军人”的第一次世界大战退伍军人手中。他们秉承垄断资本家的意旨发号施令，一般会员并无表示意见的自由。1955年，美国军团指定了六名会员对联合国教育、科学及文化组织中“共产主义及反美情况”进行调查研究。由于查无实据，调查报告只对联合国教育、科学及文化组织进行了一般性的攻击。美国军团的领导人物大为不满，于是报告作废，另由美国军团的外交关系委员会与美国主义委员会闭门造车，联合编造了一份新的报告。这就是美国军团所公布的“有关联合国教育、科学及文化组织散发颠覆性教育资料的报告”。
    美国军团还有形形色色的附属组织：美国军团辅助队，收罗了退伍军人的妻子、儿女；美国军团之子，聚合了退伍军人的儿孙。此外还有一些经办文娱活动的附属委员会：所谓四十八人委员会，八十四人委员会。由于美国军团丑恶本质日益暴露，这些附属组织也呈现了分崩离析的趋向。不久以前，四十八人委员会宣布脱离美国军团。他们所公布的理由是：美国军团为少数人所把持，这一群少数的人只照顾那些受他们摆布的人的利益。
