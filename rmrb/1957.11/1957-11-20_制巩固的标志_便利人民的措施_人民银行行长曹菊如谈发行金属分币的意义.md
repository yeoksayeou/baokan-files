Xinhua News Agency, 19th. The State Council has stipulated that metal fen coins will be issued from December 1st. Regarding this issue, Xinhua News Agency reporters interviewed Cao Juru, the President of the Head Office of the People's Bank of China. President Cao made the following statement:

The State Council's order for the People's Bank to issue three types of metal fen coins (referred to as hard fen coins) of one fen, two fen, and five fen from December 1st is an important measure taken by the People's Government to benefit the people. Over the past few years, financial prices have been stable, and the Renminbi has enjoyed extremely high prestige among the people. The issuance of hard fen coins will further enhance the prestige of the Renminbi.

Our country's First Five-Year Plan is about to be successfully completed ahead of schedule and exceeding targets. With the development of industrial and agricultural production, the expansion of commodity circulation, and the improvement of people's living standards, small transactions and making change in the daily economic lives of urban and rural people cannot do without the one fen, two fen, and five fen Renminbi. Because these fen coins are made of paper, have small denominations, and are frequently used, they are easily worn and soiled after being carried around and circulated many times. Therefore, in the past two years, many people have written letters requesting the government to issue hard fen coins to replace the circulating paper fen coins.

Currently, the paper fen coins circulating in the market need to be collected and replaced with new banknotes approximately every ten months on average. Taking Beijing as an example, in the two years and seven months since the issuance of the new currency in 1955, the damaged fen coins recovered and destroyed were equal to three times the amount of fen coins in circulation in the market in 1955. Although the cost of minting hard fen coins is much higher than the cost of printing paper fen coins, the period during which hard fen coins can be used is also much longer than the period during which paper fen coins can be used. Therefore, from a longer-term perspective, the expenses paid by the state for fen coin minting will not increase, but decrease. Of course, the issuance of metal fen coins is only possible when the monetary system is consolidated and the currency value is stable; it is impossible to imagine using metal fen coins in situations of inflation and currency devaluation. Therefore, it can be said that this issuance of hard fen coins is an important symbol of the further consolidation of our country's monetary system and the further stabilization of currency value, which once again eloquently proves the superiority of the socialist system.

The State Council's order also stipulates that after the issuance of hard fen coins on December 1st, the newly issued hard fen coins and the original paper fen coins will circulate and be used simultaneously. The two types of fen coins with the same denomination have equal value, and no one may refuse to use either of them. When our country switched to the new Renminbi in March 1955, the old Renminbi was completely redeemed within a limited time using the new Renminbi. Why is the method of recalling paper fen coins within a limited time not adopted this time when hard fen coins are issued? This is because: first, there is no change in the currency value of hard fen coins and paper fen coins, so there is no need to recall paper fen coins from the market; second, the People's Bank still has a portion of new, unissued paper fen coins. If all are replaced with hard fen coins and these paper fen coins are destroyed, it will cause losses to the state; and third, the method of recall within a limited time will inevitably increase the trouble for the people to queue up for exchange and increase the workload of the People's Bank and commercial departments for collection and exchange, and this procedure is not necessary. For the above reasons, the state stipulates that this issuance of hard fen coins will adopt the method of gradual issuance through business receipts and payments, that is, through the retail departments of state-owned, cooperative, and joint state-private commercial enterprises, these hard fen coins will be gradually issued through making change, gradually issuing new ones and collecting old ones, instead of adopting the method of recalling paper fen coins within a limited time.

In order to safeguard the interests of the state and the people and stabilize currency and finance, the State Council's order also strictly prohibits the counterfeiting and melting of hard fen coins, and violators will be severely punished according to law. It is hoped that the broad masses of people will assist the government in strengthening this work and report to the public security and judicial departments any bad elements and counter-revolutionaries who counterfeit or melt hard fen coins.

On the same day as the issuance of hard fen coins, the People's Bank will also issue a new ten-yuan note. As early as March 1955, when the new Renminbi was adopted, the State Council announced that the category of our country's new Renminbi included a ten-yuan note. Over the past few years, based on the development of industrial and agricultural production, the people's purchasing power has increased day by day, and the amount of cash payments between various sectors of the national economy has also increased day by day. Under such circumstances, it has become very necessary to issue a small amount of larger denomination banknotes to facilitate market transactions and people's use. The State Council's decision to start issuing ten-yuan notes on December 1st, like the issuance of hard fen coins, is the result of the development of our country's industrial and agricultural production, the expansion of commodity circulation, the stability of financial prices, and the improvement of people's living standards. It is believed that the issuance of ten-yuan notes will be beneficial to meeting the needs of market circulation and facilitating the people.

The issuance of hard fen coins and ten-yuan notes is a major event related to the lives of the people, and it is hoped that the people of the whole country will assist the government in successfully completing this issuance work. (Attached pictures)

    币制巩固的标志　便利人民的措施
    人民银行行长曹菊如谈发行金属分币的意义
    新华社19日讯　国务院规定自12月1日起发行金属分币。关于这个问题，新华社记者走访了中国人民银行总行曹菊如行长，曹行长发表谈话如下：
    国务院命令人民银行自12月1日起发行一分、二分和五分的三种金属分币（简称硬分币），这是人民政府为了便利人民群众所采取的一项重要措施。几年以来，金融物价是稳定的，人民币在人民群众中的威信是极高的，发行硬分币以后，人民币的威信将更为提高。
    我国第一个五年建设计划即将胜利地提前和超额完成，随着工农业生产的发展、商品流通的扩大和人民生活水平的提高，城乡人民日常经济生活中小额交易和找零兑整离不开一分、二分、五分的人民币。这些分币因为是纸质的，面额小，使用繁，经过人们随身携带，多次周转，很容易磨损和污染。因此，近两年来，不少群众来信，要求政府发行硬分币代替纸分币流通。
    目前市场上流通的纸分币，大约平均经过十个月，就要收回来另换新钞。以北京市为例，从1955年发行新币以来的两年零七个月里，收回销毁的残破分币，等于1955年市场分币流通量的三倍。铸造硬分币的成本，虽然远高于印刷纸分币的成本；但是硬分币能够使用的期间，也远远超过纸分币能够使用的期间。因此，从较长的时期看，国家在分币铸造方面支付的费用将不是增加，而是减少。当然，发行金属分币只有在货币制度巩固、币值稳定的情况下才有可能；通货膨胀、币值下跌的情况是不可能设想使用金属分币的。因此可以说，这次发行硬分币是我国货币制度进一步巩固和币值进一步稳定的重要标志，这也又一次雄辩地证明了社会主义制度的优越性。
    国务院命令中还规定，12月1日发行硬分币以后，新发行的硬分币和原有的纸分币，将同时流通，混合使用。面额相同的两种分币价值相等，任何人不得拒绝使用其中任何一种。1955年我国改用新人民币的时候，是用新的人民币限期把旧人民币全部收兑回来的。这次发行硬分币，为什么不采取限期收回纸分币的办法呢？这是因为：第一、硬分币和纸分币在币值上并没有变动，因而没有必要将纸分币从市场上收回；第二、现在人民银行还存有一部分新的没有发行过的纸分币，如果全部改用硬分币，销毁这些纸分币，会造成国家的损失；而且第三、采取限期收回的办法，必然要增加人民群众排队兑换的麻烦，增大人民银行和商业部门的收兑工作量，而这种手续并不是必要的。由于以上原因，国家规定，这次发行硬分币采取通过业务收付途径逐步发行的办法，就是通过国营、合作社营和公私合营商业的零售部门，用找零的方式，把这些硬分币陆续发行出去，逐步发新收旧，而不采取限期收回纸分币的办法。
    为了维护国家和人民群众的利益，稳定货币金融，国务院命令中还严厉禁止假造和熔化硬分币，违者要依法严予惩处。希望广大人民群众，协助政府加强这方面的工作，发现有坏分子和反革命分子假造或者熔化硬分币，随时向公安和司法部门检举。
    在发行硬分币的同一天，人民银行还要发行一种十元面额的新券。早在1955年3月改用新人民币的时候，国务院公布的我国新人民币类别中就列有十元券一种。几年来，在工农业生产发展的基础上，人民购买力日益提高了，国民经济各部门之间现金支付的数量也日益扩大了，在这种情况下，发行少量的较大面额的钞票，以便利市场交易和人民使用，就成为十分必要。国务院决定在12月1日开始发行十元券，这也同发行硬分币一样，是我国工农业生产发展、商品流通扩大、金融物价稳定和人民生活水平提高的结果。可以相信，发行十元券，对于满足市场流通的需要和便利人民群众，将有一定的好处。
    发行硬分币和十元券是关系到人民群众生活的一件大事，希望全国人民协助政府顺利地做好这次的发行工作。（附图片）
