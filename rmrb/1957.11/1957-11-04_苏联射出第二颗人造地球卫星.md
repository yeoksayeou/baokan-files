    USSR Launches Second Artificial Earth Satellite
    Satellite Weighs 508 Kilograms, Carries a Dog to an Altitude of 1,500 Kilometers, Fully Equipped with Instruments, Signals Transmitted Globally
    Xinhua News Agency, November 3rd -- TASS, Moscow, November 3rd: TASS Communiqué:
    In accordance with the international geophysical year's scientific research plan for the upper atmosphere and the study of physical processes and living conditions in outer space, the Soviet Union launched its second artificial Earth satellite on November 3rd.
    The second artificial satellite manufactured by the Soviet Union constitutes the final stage of a carrier rocket, which contains a container for scientific instruments.
    The second artificial satellite carries:
    Instruments for studying the sun's radiation in the short-wave ultraviolet and X-ray spectral bands;
    Instruments for studying cosmic rays;
    Instruments for studying temperature and pressure;
    A sealed container with an experimental animal (dog), air conditioning equipment, food reserves, and various instruments for studying life activities under space conditions;
    Measuring instruments used to send scientific measurement data to Earth;
    Two radio transmitters with frequencies of 40.002 and 20.005 megahertz (wavelengths of approximately 7.5 and 15 meters, respectively);
    Necessary power supply equipment.
    The total weight of the above-mentioned instruments, experimental animal, and power supply equipment is 508.3 kilograms.
    According to observed data, the satellite has achieved an orbital velocity of approximately 8,000 meters per second.
    According to calculations (which are being corrected by direct observation), the maximum distance from the satellite to the Earth's surface exceeds 1,500 kilometers; the time for the satellite to complete one orbit around the Earth is approximately one hour and forty-two minutes; the angle of inclination formed by the flight orbit and the equatorial plane is approximately sixty-five degrees.
    According to measurement data obtained from the satellite, the operation of the scientific instruments and the monitoring of the animal's life activities are proceeding normally.
    The second artificial satellite flew over the Moscow city area twice on November 3rd at 7:20 and 9:05 (Moscow time).
    The signal from the radio transmitter on the satellite with a frequency of 20.005 megahertz is in the form of telegraph signals, with each signal lasting approximately 0.3 seconds and the interval also being 0.3 seconds. The radio transmitter with a frequency of 40.002 megahertz operates in a continuous transmission state.
    Soviet scientists have successfully launched a second artificial Earth satellite carrying various scientific instruments and an experimental animal. They are expanding the study of outer space and the upper atmosphere by launching satellites. Natural phenomena processes occurring in space that are not yet understood will now be more easily understood by mankind.
    The people of various scientific research institutes, design organizations, experimenters, and factories that manufactured the second artificial Earth satellite are celebrating the fortieth anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution with the launch of the satellite.
    Xinhua News Agency, November 3rd -- Beijing Xinhua News Agency Radio's receiver had received the signals from the radio transmitter of the Soviet Union's second artificial satellite twice by 5:32 PM Beijing time on the 3rd. The first time was from 5:05 to 5:10, the signal was strong, gradually weakening, and could not be heard after 5:10. The second time was from 5:28 to 5:32, the signal was very weak. These signals were all heard according to the frequency of 20.005 megahertz published by TASS.
    Xinhua News Agency, November 3rd -- From 9:00 to 9:04 PM Beijing time on the 3rd, Beijing Xinhua News Agency Radio's receiver listened to the radio signals from the Soviet Union's second artificial satellite for the third time. This time it was also heard according to the frequency of 20.005 megahertz published by TASS.
    Xinhua News Agency, November 3rd -- On November 3rd, many radio stations and radio enthusiasts around the world have already received the strong signals transmitted by the second artificial Earth satellite launched by the Soviet Union.
    Cooper, a staff member at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the United States, received the signal at 7:02 Greenwich time. Engineers at the Naval Research Institute in Fort Monmouth, New Jersey, also received the signal. An employee of the Yalesy Love Radio Company said that he had received the signal twice in two hours in the morning, and the sound was very loud.
    The BBC's Tatsfield listening station in Surrey and Reuters' London listening station received strong signals early in the morning, and the BBC also rebroadcast these signals. Dr. Ryle of the Cavendish Laboratory Observatory at Cambridge University also received the signal. The UPI's listening stations in London and Bickley, Kent, received one or two signals this morning, respectively. A spokesman for the London listening station said that the signal of the second artificial satellite was much stronger than that of the first satellite.
    Staff at the Paris Broadcasting Station received the signal at 7:36 Greenwich time in the morning. The AFP Paris listening station received two signals, which lasted for up to five minutes.
    In addition, the Bonn Observatory received a signal this morning, the Dutch ANP listening station in The Hague received two signals, and Copenhagen received three signals. Bern in Switzerland, Frankfurt in the German Democratic Republic, and Swedish Radio also received signals.
    Radio stations in Tokyo, Melbourne, Tangier, Singapore, and other places also received signals. Many radio enthusiasts in various parts of Japan also received signals.
    According to UPI, a housewife named White in Melbourne also saw the artificial satellite flying from northwest to southeast at 10:15 Greenwich time.

Not long ago, the Soviet Union conducted experiments sending several dogs to an altitude of 210 kilometers. This experiment prepared the conditions for launching artificial satellites with animal passengers. This is a dog sent to an altitude of 210 kilometers for the experiment.

    给十月革命佳节的光辉献礼　向宇宙进军的又一重大胜利
    苏联射出第二颗人造地球卫星
    卫星体重五百零八公斤，载狗高飞一千五百公里，仪器配备齐全，讯号传遍全球
    新华社3日讯　塔斯社莫斯科3日电：塔斯社公报：
    根据国际地球物理年大气高层科学研究及宇宙空间物理过程和生活条件研究计划，11月3日苏联发射了第二颗人造地球卫星。
    苏联制造的第二颗人造卫星构成运载火箭的最后一级，它内部有装科学仪器的容器。
    第二颗人造卫星上载有：
    研究太阳在短波紫外线和X射线光谱段的辐射的仪器；
    研究宇宙线的仪器；
    研究温度和压力的仪器；
    装有试验动物（狗）、空气调节装置、食物储备和研究在宇宙空间条件下的生命活动的各种仪器的密闭容器；
    用来向地球发送科学测量材料的测量仪器。
    频率分别为四○·○○二和二○·○○五兆赫（波长分别约为七·五和十五公尺）的两台无线电发报机；
    必要的电源设备。
    上述仪器、试验动物和电源设备的总重量为五○八·三公斤。
    根据观察所得的材料，卫星获得了约每秒八千公尺的轨道速度。
    根据计算（这种计算正在用直接观察校正），卫星离地球表面的最大距离超过一千五百公里；卫星绕地球一整圈的时间约为一时四十二分；飞行轨道和赤道平面所形成的倾斜角约为六十五度。
    根据从卫星上获得的测量材料，科学仪器的工作和对动物的生命活动的检查进行得很正常。
    第二颗人造卫星在11月3日七点二十分和九点五分（莫斯科时间）曾两次飞过莫斯科市区的上空。
    卫星上频率为二○·○○五兆赫的无线电发报机的讯号采用电报讯号的形式，每个讯号持续时间约为○·三秒，间隔也为○·三秒。频率为四○·○○二兆赫的无线电发报机以连续发射的状态工作。
    苏联科学家成功地发射了带有各种科学仪器和试验动物的第二颗人造地球卫星，他们正在以发射卫星来扩大着对宇宙空间和大气高层的研究。宇宙中发生的尚未了解的自然现象过程现在将比较容易为人类所理解了。
    制造第二颗人造地球卫星的各科学研究所、设计机构、试验者和工厂的人们用卫星的发射来庆祝伟大的十月社会主义革命四十周年。
    新华社3日讯　北京新华社电台的收讯机到3日下午北京时间五时三十二分已经两次收到了苏联第二颗人造卫星的无线电发报机发出的讯号。第一次听到是五时零五分到十分，讯号较强，慢慢减弱，十分以后就听不到了。第二次听到是五时二十八分到三十二分，讯号很弱。这种讯号都是根据塔斯社公布的频率二○·○○五兆赫听到的。
    新华社3日讯　3日下午北京时间九时到九时零四分，北京新华社电台的收讯机第三次收听到了苏联第二颗人造卫星发出的无线电讯号。这次也是根据塔斯社公布的频率二○·○○五兆赫听到的。
    新华社3日讯　11月3日，世界各地许多电台和无线电爱好者已经收到了苏联发射的第二个人造地球卫星所发出的强力讯号。
    美国马萨诸塞工艺研究所的工作人员库柏在格林威治时间七点零二分就收到了讯号。新泽西州蒙摩斯堡的海军研究机构的工程师也收到了讯号。亚尔西爱无线电公司的一个雇员说，他早上在两小时内曾两次收听到讯号，声音很响。
    英国广播公司萨利郡塔茨菲尔德收听站和路透社伦敦收听站一清早就收到了强大讯号，广播公司还转播了这些讯号。剑桥大学卡文第什实验观测站的里尔博士也收到讯号。合众社在伦敦和肯特郡比克利的收听站今晨分别收到一两次讯号。伦敦收听站的发言人说，第二个人造卫星的讯号比第一个卫星的讯号强大得多。
    巴黎广播台的工作人员在早上格林威治时间七点三十六分收到了讯号。法新社巴黎收听站收到两次讯号，讯号延长达五分钟之久。
    此外，波恩的观测站今晨收到一次讯号，海牙的全荷通讯社收听站收到两次，哥本哈根收到三次。瑞士的伯尔尼、民主德国的法兰克福以及瑞典广播电台也收到了讯号。
