    Budapest dispatch of this newspaper: Hungary has more than 40 years of experience in manufacturing locomotives. The largest one is the Budapest Locomotive and Railway Manufacturing Factory. This factory used to mainly produce steam locomotives, but now it has completely switched to diesel-electric locomotives. They manufacture electric locomotives ranging from 200 to 600 horsepower of three different types. The advantages of this type of locomotive are: its thermal efficiency and tractive force are twice as high as those of steam locomotives; the locomotive itself is light and flexible, can be started at any time, is easy to drive in arid desert areas where there is no water source, and is also suitable for railways with many tunnels because it has no smoke.
    Hungarian diesel-electric locomotives are not only for domestic use, but also exported to the Soviet Union, Egypt, and India. Hungary will soon supply our country with three 600-horsepower diesel-electric locomotives. Now, the factory's workers and technicians are working meticulously. They are processing and improving the cooling, gauges, hook machine structure, and motor dust-proof equipment according to China's climate conditions. The manufacturing plant also plans to send a technical team to China with the locomotives to guide the use and test the locomotives' performance. (Attached picture)

    匈牙利柴油电动机车效能高
    供给我国的机车正在细致地进行加工
    本报布达佩斯讯　匈牙利制造机车已有四十多年的经验，规模最大的一家是布达佩斯机车轨道制造厂，该厂过去主要生产蒸汽机车，现在全部改制柴油电动机车。他们制造由二百到六百三种不同马力的电动机车。这种机车的优点是：热效能和引力都比蒸汽机车高一倍，机车本身轻便、灵活，随时可以发动，在没有水源的荒漠地区便于行驶，多山洞的铁道使用这种机车也适宜，因为它没有煤烟。
    匈牙利柴油电动机车除供本国使用外还出口到苏联、埃及和印度。匈牙利不久将供给我国三部六百马力的柴油电动机车，现在制造厂的工人和技术员正在细致地工作。他们在冷却、规矩、挂钩机器结构和电机防尘设备方面都按照中国的气候条件进行加工和改进。制造厂还准备派技术小组随机车到中国指导使用和检验机车效能。（附图片）
