Xinhua News Agency Report: The news of the successful launch of the Soviet Union's second artificial satellite has sparked cheers in Eastern European socialist countries.

Polish renowned astronomer Gadomski said that the launch of the second artificial satellite is of great significance to world science. The weight of the artificial satellite is astonishing, and it flies so high.

The news of the second artificial satellite is being discussed all over Czechoslovakia. The scientific community's reaction is particularly enthusiastic. The President of the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences, Z. Niejedly, told reporters on the 3rd that the launch of the new artificial satellite is the latest and greatest achievement of Soviet scientists. There is no doubt that Soviet scientists will take many new steps to study the universe.

The German Democratic Republic's "Neues Deutschland" immediately published an extra edition after receiving the news of the successful satellite launch on the 3rd. The headline of the extra edition was "New Great Victory of Socialist Science." This good news soon became a topic of conversation full of joy for the people of the whole country.

Hungarian scientist Alimar said in a broadcast on the 3rd that the successful launch of the second artificial satellite proves that the Soviet Union has no theoretical or practical difficulties in manufacturing rockets to fly to the moon.

The Romanian capital Bucharest evening newspaper "Informaţia Bucureştiului" published the TASS communiqué on the entire front page on the 3rd. The evening newspaper was immediately snapped up. "Free Romania," which was originally on holiday on the 4th, published a special issue on artificial satellites on the 4th. In addition to publishing the communiqué, it also reported on articles by Romanian scientists and the people's cheers for this event. Bucharest Observatory Director Jemeterescu said that the brilliant victory of Soviet scientists has opened the way to explore the universe.

Bulgarian Radio said in a commentary on this major event on the 3rd that the successful launch of the artificial satellite is a new step forward for the Soviet Union in the great cause of consolidating peace.

The Albanian people happily welcomed the good news. They believe that this brilliant victory of the Soviet Union is the most outstanding contribution to the further development of world science and the most outstanding gift from Soviet scientists to the 40th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution.

The launch of the Soviet Union's second artificial Earth satellite has aroused great interest among Western European scientists and newspapers. Scientists expressed their praise for the new achievements of Soviet science and technology.

British newspapers of various political tendencies all published the news of the second artificial satellite on the 4th with admiring tones. The "Daily Express" said that the Soviet Union's achievement is "amazing." It said that this proves that Soviet scientists are much further ahead of the West in conquering space than people thought. Kenneth Gatland, vice chairman of the British Interplanetary Society, said that the Soviet Union's achievement technically "greatly puts the United States in the position of a third-rate country, because the United States cannot successfully launch its 100-ton intercontinental ballistic missile." He said: "It is very likely to make the United States lag behind by a full ten years in the engineering development of rockets."

West German Bremen "German Rocket Research Society" Chairman Statt and rocket expert Moore said that the rocket carrying the second Soviet satellite must weigh at least 100 tons, which is an "amazing and great" achievement. Statt said he believed that Soviet scientists would be able to shoot rockets to the moon. When Hamburg Radio broadcast the news of the Soviet Union's launch of its second artificial Earth satellite on the 3rd, it pointed out that biology has now begun its first cosmic journey in history.

France's "Dimanche-Matin" published an article by Jacques Bayart. The author said that the Soviet Union has extremely superb technology in radio-guided rockets. Bayart said that the second satellite proves that the Soviet Union has greatly surpassed the United States in technology: scientists estimate that it exceeds the United States by two years in satellites, five years in rockets, and ten years in astronomy. French scientist Aronov said, "The most important aspect of the second satellite is not so much its speed, weight and altitude - although these are remarkable - as the fact that a living animal is installed in the satellite." He believes that this is the first time that a living object has stayed in a place with absolutely no gravity for more than a few minutes. Aronov said, I originally thought that if the second one was to be sent higher, it would be smaller. It fully proves that they have solved the problems of special alloys and fuels. He added, I have no doubt that the Russians have manufactured several more advanced projectiles, including projectiles to the moon. He said, "They are now far ahead of the Americans, who are still testing their small projectiles and simply don't know how to use a projectile weighing about 500,000 kilograms to launch an artificial satellite weighing 500 kilograms."

A spokesman for the North Atlantic military group headquarters said that the launch of the second satellite is a "shocking achievement of Soviet science."

New York News: The news of the Soviet Union's launch of its second larger artificial Earth satellite has aroused great interest in the United States. It is generally believed that this is another convincing proof of the great progress of Soviet science and technology.

Newspapers in New York and other cities in the United States published the news of the satellite on the front page with extra-large headlines, and radio and television stations also listed the news of the satellite as the most important program.

The New York "Daily Mirror" published an editorial saying: The facts prove that "Soviet science is not only much more advanced than the Western world realizes, but its ability to turn theory into practical achievements has also proven to be beyond our estimates."

Agence France-Presse reporters stationed in the United States reported: "This is the second time it has been shown that the Russians are leading in artificial satellites, and American scientists have not even had time to catch up with the Russians' first achievement, which has created a sense of national disappointment and extra admiration for Soviet scientific achievements. People have little doubt that the Soviets are the masters in a field where Americans have long considered themselves invincible." The news agency said that Washington officials re-recognized that, in terms of military technology, repeating the accurate action of the Soviet third-stage rocket launching into a definite orbit again in less than a month proves that the Soviet Union has made great progress in long-range ballistics and proves that the United States is behind the Soviet Union.

John Lossbrook, editor of "Air Force Magazine," said that this is "another psychological and technical defeat for the United States by the Soviet Union."

Diplomats in Washington also believe that the Soviet artificial satellite No. 2, which revolves around the earth with a dog in an airtight device, has given the Soviet Union a powerful new voice in the psychological and propaganda tug-of-war between the East and the West. It dispels any doubts about whether the Soviet Union is a first-rate scientific power.

Hugh Baillie, vice president and general manager of the Asia branch of United Press International, sent a message from Tokyo on the 3rd saying that the rise of the Soviet Union's second artificial Earth satellite means another decline in the United States' position in Asia. He said that the second satellite proves to Asians that the first Soviet satellite was not a scientific spectacle. It means that the Soviet Union is increasingly respected by Asians. Hugh Baillie said that Asians have been deeply impressed by the huge artificial satellite carrying a dog. Now they are waiting for the Soviets to turn rumors of marching to the moon into reality.

American scientists expressed widespread surprise and admiration for the news of the Soviet Union's launch of its second artificial satellite. Many scientists have speculated that the Soviet Union has been able to send such heavy objects to such high altitudes because it must have made new synthetic fuels with very high energy. According to a report by NBC, three American scientists said on November 3 that they believed that the Soviet Union could make a plan to fly to the moon next time. Dr. Kaplan, chairman of the US International Geophysical Year Committee, said in a conversation: "According to statistical calculations, we believe that the Russians are capable of making a plan to go to the moon." Dr. Roy, a US rocket authority, said in another conversation: "The Russians are very close to marching to the moon." John Rinehart, assistant director of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory in Cambridge, Massachusetts, said he was "convinced" that the Soviets "could reach the moon in a few days."

At the same time, American politicians expressed widespread anxiety about the Soviet Union's launch of its second artificial satellite. The White House and the State Department refused to comment on the news of the Soviet Union's launch of its second satellite, and spread the theory of "anticipated." However, Secretary of Defense McElroy had to admit: "We must say that they (the Soviets) have gained a position in rocket science. They have made great progress." Senator O'Mahoney asked Eisenhower to convene a special session of Congress, accusing the government of "sacrificing the United States' leadership in the world." Several members of Congress used the satellite news as an excuse to step up the arms race, and they demanded that the United States step up the development of missiles to "deal with the Soviet Union's second satellite."

Major Japanese newspapers all reported the successful launch of the Soviet Union's second artificial satellite in a prominent position on the 4th, and published talks by many famous scientists. They placed great hopes on the contribution that artificial satellites will bring to the International Geophysical Year. Tokyo University professor Hideo Itokawa said that Soviet scientists and engineers must have designed a new engine or discovered a new fuel to launch an artificial satellite loaded with dogs and food. He also said that artificial satellites carrying people will be realized in the near future.

Japanese newspapers are very concerned about and value the fact that the second artificial satellite contains a dog. "Mainichi Shimbun" said that this is the first time that an animal has reached a corner of the universe. Moreover, this will be the first step for mankind to conquer the universe in the future. According to "Yomiuri Shimbun", Tokyo University of Education Professor Yasaburo Sugi said that from this, it can be inferred that the Soviet Union has solved more than 90% of the problems concerning space travel. He speculated that an artificial satellite carrying people could be launched in less than two years.

Kyodo News Agency said that it is estimated that a rocket capable of launching an object weighing 500 kilograms at a speed of eight kilometers per second can carry about one ton of hydrogen bombs. Therefore, it is conceivable that the Soviet Union already has the kind of intercontinental ballistic rocket that can drop hydrogen bombs anywhere on earth.

    各国人民欢呼四起　帝国主义惊恐万状
    苏联第二个人造卫星震撼世界
    科学界认为苏联已掌握了打开月宫的钥匙
    舆论界指出美国在和平竞赛中再一次丢脸
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：苏联第二颗人造卫星发射成功的消息，在东欧各社会主义国家里引起了一片欢呼声。
    波兰著名的天文学家加多姆斯基说，第二颗人造卫星的发射，对于世界科学有巨大的意义。人造卫星的重量令人吃惊，而且还飞得那么高。
    捷克斯洛伐克全国各地都在谈论着第二颗人造卫星的消息。科学界的反应特别热烈。捷克斯洛伐克科学院院长兹·尼耶德利3日向新闻记者说，新的人造卫星的发射，是苏联科学家的新的最大成就。毫无疑问，苏联科学家将采取许多新的步骤来研究宇宙。
    民主德国“新德意志报”3日收到卫星发射成功的消息后，立即发行了号外。号外的通栏标题是“社会主义科学的新的巨大胜利”。这个喜讯不久就成为全国人民充满喜悦的谈话主题。
    匈牙利科学家阿利玛尔在3日的广播中说，第二颗人造卫星的发射成功，证明了苏联在制造飞向月球的火箭方面，已经没有任何理论和实际上的困难了。
    罗马尼亚首都布加勒斯特晚报“消息报”3日以第一版整版的篇幅发表了塔斯社的公报。晚报出版后，立刻被争购一空。原来在4日休假的自由罗马尼亚报，4日出版了人造卫星专刊。除发表了公报外，还报道了罗马尼亚科学家的文章和人民对这一事件的欢呼情况。布加勒斯特天文台台长杰麦特列斯库说，苏联科学家的辉煌胜利开辟了研究宇宙空间的道路。
    保加利亚广播电台3日在评论这一重大事件时说，人造卫星的发射成功，是苏联在巩固和平的伟大事业的道路上前进的新的一步。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民欢欣鼓舞地迎接这个好消息。他们认为，苏联的这一辉煌胜利，对世界科学的进一步发展是一个最卓越的贡献，是苏联科学家对伟大的十月社会主义革命四十周年最出色的献礼。
    苏联发射第二颗人造地球卫星引起了西欧科学界人士和报纸极大的兴趣。科学家对苏联科学和技术的新成就表示赞扬。
    英国各种政治倾向的报纸4日都以赞叹的笔调刊登了第二颗人造卫星的消息。“每日快报”说，苏联的成就是“奇妙的”。它说，这证明苏联科学家在征服空间方面走在西方的前面要比人们认为的远得多。英国星际交通协会副主席肯尼思·加特兰德说，苏联的成就在技术上“大大地使美国处于三等国的地位，因为美国还无法成功地发射它的一百吨的洲际弹道导弹。”他说：“它非常可能使美国在火箭的工程发展方面落后整整十年。”
    西德不来梅“德国火箭研究会”主席斯塔次和火箭专家摩尔说，运载第二颗苏联卫星的火箭一定至少重一百吨，这是“惊人的和伟大的”成就。斯塔次表示他相信苏联科学家一定能够把火箭射到月球上去。汉堡电台在3日广播苏联发射第二颗人造地球卫星的消息时指出，现在生物在历史上开始了第一次的宇宙旅行。
    法国“星期晚报”发表了雅盖·贝雅尔的文章。作者说，苏联在用无线电导引火箭方面具有极为高超的技术。贝雅尔说，第二颗卫星证明，苏联在技术方面大大超越了美国：据科学家估计，在卫星方面超过两年，在火箭方面超过五年，在天文学方面超过十年。法国科学家阿诺诺夫说，“第二颗卫星的最重要方面与其说是它的速度、重量和高度——虽然这些是很了不起的——，倒不如说是一个活的动物装在卫星内这个事实。”他认为，一个活的物体在完全没有地心吸引力的地方呆了超过几分钟以上的时间，这还是第一次。阿诺诺夫说，我本来认为如果第二颗要送得高些，那就会小些。它完全证明了他们已经解决了特别合金和燃料的问题。他又说，我并不怀疑俄国人已经制造了几个更先进的投射物，包括飞到月亮上去的投射物在内。他说，“他们现在远远超过美国人了，美国人现在还在试验他们的小型投射物，根本不知道如何用一个大概重五十万公斤的投射物射出一颗五百公斤重的人造卫星。”
    北大西洋军事集团总部的一个发言人说，发射第二颗卫星是“苏联科学上的令人震惊的成就。”
    纽约消息：苏联发射第二颗更大的人造地球卫星的消息在美国引起了极大的兴趣。人们普遍认为，这是苏联科学技术巨大进步的又一个令人信服的明证。
    纽约以及美国其他城市的报纸都以特大标题在第一版刊登卫星的消息，广播电台和电视站也都把卫星的消息列为最重要的节目。
    纽约“每日镜报”发表社论说：事实证明，“苏联的科学不仅比西方世界所认识到的要进步得多，而且它的把理论变为实际成就的能力也已经证明出乎我们估计之外。”
    法新社驻美记者报道说：“这是第二次说明俄国人在人造卫星方面领先了，而美国科学家甚至没有时间赶上俄国人的第一个成就，这就造成了一种民族的失望感，而对于苏联科学成就格外佩服了。人们已很少怀疑，在美国人长期来认为自己是无敌的领域中，苏联人是主宰者。”这家通讯社说，华盛顿人士重新认识到，在军事技术方面，不到一个月的时间，再一次重复苏联第三级火箭在一个确定的轨道上的发射这样准确的行动，证明了苏联在远射程弹道等方面获得了巨大的进步，证明美国比苏联落后了。
    美国“空军杂志”编辑约翰·洛斯布劳克说，这是“苏联又一次在心理和技术的领域内击败了美国”。
    华盛顿外交人士也认为，以有空气的设备带着狗环绕着地球旋转的苏联人造卫星第二号，使苏联在东西方的心理和宣传拉锯战中有了强有力的新的发言权。它排除了任何关于苏联是不是第一等的科学强国的怀疑。
    合众社副社长兼亚洲总分社社长霍布雷奇特3日自东京发出消息说，苏联第二颗人造地球卫星的升起意味着美国在亚洲的地位的又一次下降。他说，第二颗卫星向亚洲人证明：第一颗苏联卫星并不是科学上的奇景。它意味着苏联越来越受到亚洲人的尊重。霍布雷奇特说，亚洲人已经为载有着狗的巨大的人造卫星留下深刻的印象。现在他们正在等着苏联人把向月球进军的传闻变成为事实。
    美国科学家对苏联发射第二颗人造卫星的消息表现了广泛的惊奇和赞佩。许多科学家纷纷揣测，苏联能够把这样重的物体送到这样高的高空，一定是制成了能量非常大的新的合成燃料。据美国全国广播公司报道，有三位美国科学家11月3日说，他们认为苏联下一次能够作出飞到月球上去的计划。美国国际地球物理年委员会主席卡普兰博士在一次谈话中说：“根据统计计算，我们相信俄国人是能够作出到月球上去的计划。”美国火箭权威勒伊博士在另一次谈话中说：“俄国人已经非常接近于向月球进军了。”马萨诸塞州剑桥的史密森氏天体物理天文台助理台长约翰·赖讷哈特说，他“坚信”，苏联人“能够在几天之后到达月球”。
    和这同时，美国政界人士对苏联第二颗人造卫星的发射表现了普遍的焦虑不安。白宫和国务院对苏联发射第二颗卫星的消息拒绝发表意见，并且散布“早已预料到的”论调。但是，国防部长麦克艾罗伊不得不承认：“我们必须说他们（苏联人）在火箭科学方面取得了地位。他们取得了巨大的进步”。参议员奥马洪尼要求艾森豪威尔召开一次国会特别会议，他指责政府“牺牲了美国领导世界的地位”。有好些议员把卫星消息作为加紧扩军的借口，他们要求美国加紧发展导弹来“对付俄国的第二颗卫星”。
    日本各大报纸4日都以显著地位报道了苏联第二颗人造卫星的发射成功，并且登载了许多著名科学家的谈话。他们对人造卫星将为国际地球物理年带来的贡献寄予极大的希望。东京大学教授丝川英夫说，苏联科学家和工程师们一定设计出了新的发动机或者是发现了新的燃料才能发射装着狗和食物的人造卫星。他并且说，有人乘坐的人造卫星在不久的将来一定会实现。
    日本报纸很关心和重视第二颗人造卫星里面载有一只狗的事实。“每日新闻”说，这是动物第一次到达宇宙的一个角落。并且，这将成为人类将来征服宇宙的第一步。据“读卖新闻”刊载，东京教育大学教授杉靖三郎说，由此可以推想，关于宇宙旅行问题，苏联已经解决了90％以上。他推测，不到两年，有人乘坐的人造卫星就能够发射。
    共同社说，据估计，一支能以每秒八公里的速度发射重五百公斤的物体的火箭能够运载约一吨重的氢弹。因此，可以想像，苏联已经有了向地球上任何地方投掷氢弹的那种洲际弹道火箭。
