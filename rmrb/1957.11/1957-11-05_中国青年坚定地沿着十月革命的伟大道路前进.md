Chinese youth, with boundless joy and excitement, warmly celebrate the fortieth anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution. We celebrate this glorious festival to more firmly advance along the great road of the October Revolution, and together with progressive young brothers around the world, raise even higher the banner of communism and march towards final victory.

The salvo of the October Revolution opened a new era in human history, changed the face of the youth movement, and promoted the development of the communist youth movement. Now, more than seventy countries around the world have established youth organizations led by communist parties and workers' parties. Due to the uneven development of the revolutionary movement, the communist youth movements in various countries are at different historical stages, and therefore bear different specific tasks entrusted by the Party. However, our overall goal is consistent. Our fundamental task is to educate the younger generation with the great ideals of the October Revolution, cultivate shock forces for world peace and human progress, and cultivate reliable reserve forces for the cause of communism.

The first communist youth organization established after the October Revolution—the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League of the Soviet Union—carried out arduous work according to Lenin's instructions. In 1920, the third year after the October Revolution, Comrade Lenin issued this call to the Soviet Komsomol members and all young people: "The Komsomol and all young people who generally want to move towards communism should study communism." He clearly pointed out that the task of the Komsomol is to "train young men and women to become true communists." Following Lenin's teachings, the Soviet Komsomol has made brilliant contributions in educating youth in the spirit of communism and leading them to realize the historical tasks of the Party in various periods. For forty years, under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Soviet Komsomol has cultivated a brand-new generation. In the 1920s, after returning from the front lines of defeating the White bandits, there were 1.5 million young shock workers engaged in reconstruction. In the 1930s, the slogan "Go to the construction site of the Five-Year Plan" resounded among young people, and "Komsomol City" appeared on the desolate banks of the Amur River. In the 1940s, 3,507,000 Komsomol members were awarded the title of Soviet Hero and various orders and medals in the battle against the German invaders. And today, in the 1950s, Soviet youth are again establishing merits on the construction sites of communism. The 400,000 young men and women who rushed to the vast virgin land are shock troops in the reclamation movement. The achievements and honors represented by the five medals illustrate that the Soviet Komsomol has lived up to Lenin's teachings and deserves to be a capable assistant to the Soviet Communist Party.

These glorious deeds and outstanding achievements of the Soviet Komsomol and youth are encouraging the fighting spirit of millions of young people in various countries and inspiring the construction enthusiasm of 120 million young people and 23 million Komsomol members in our country. The Soviet Komsomol has shown the world the heroic and fearless face of young communists under the leadership of the Communist Party. The Chinese Communist Youth League has always regarded the Soviet Komsomol as its best example and closest comrade-in-arms.

These achievements of Soviet Komsomol members and all young people are the result of the tireless education in the spirit of communism by the Party and the League. The Communist Party cherishes young people most and hopes to cultivate from among them thousands upon thousands of loyal defenders and reliable successors to the cause of the Party and the people. And only young people armed with communist ideology can live up to the Party's expectations. The thirty-nine-year history of the Soviet Komsomol is a history of struggle in the youth to destroy capitalist ideas and establish socialist and communist ideas. Now that the Soviet Union has entered the historical period of transition to communism, the system of exploitation has been eradicated at its roots, and the social foundation of bourgeois ideology has long ceased to exist. However, the Soviet Komsomol remains vigilant at all times against the influence of the remnants of domestic bourgeois ideology and international capitalist forces on Soviet youth. To ensure the healthy growth of young people, the Soviet Komsomol continues to work hard to carry out a resolute struggle against this influence and constantly strengthen ideological education. When the Soviet Komsomol held its Twelfth Congress in 1954, the Central Committee of the CPSU requested the Soviet Komsomol to further enhance its role in the communist education of young people. In February of this year, the Soviet Komsomol held a central plenary session specifically to discuss improving ideological education. The plenary session called on Komsomol organizations to strengthen labor education and revolutionary tradition education among young people and to counter the propaganda conspiracies of the bourgeoisie. There is no doubt that these measures will raise the ideological awareness of Soviet youth to new heights.

Under the influence of the October Revolution, with the development of the Chinese communist movement, the Chinese communist youth movement has also developed. After the October Revolution, the Communist Party of China and the Chinese communist youth organizations tirelessly spread Marxist ideas and promoted the road of the October Revolution among young people. And today, the fundamental task of encouraging young people to firmly advance along the road of the October Revolution and educating the younger generation in the spirit of communism has not weakened in the slightest, but has even more profound significance.

Today, China is in a period of transition to a socialist society. Although we have basically completed the socialist revolution in the ownership of the means of production, the question of "who will win" between the working class and the bourgeoisie has not been finally resolved. The bourgeoisie is trying to disintegrate us ideologically and politically, paralyze our class consciousness, and weaken our fighting will. Therefore, Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out that we must also carry out a thorough socialist revolution politically and ideologically. It will take about ten to fifteen years to complete this revolution. The current struggle of the people of our country against the bourgeois rightists and the socialist debate is a decisive step in realizing this revolution. In this struggle, the bourgeoisie is doing everything possible to compete with us for young people. Facts have proved that the vast majority of Chinese youth firmly support the Communist Party and socialism. However, because most of them come from peasant, petty-bourgeois, or even bourgeois families, and lack the training of class struggle, they are easily captured by bourgeois ideas. Therefore, destroying capitalist ideas and establishing socialist ideas among young people is a long-term and central task of the Chinese Communist Youth League. The Chinese Communist Youth League must tirelessly arm young people with the proletarian worldview—Marxism-Leninism, strengthen their working-class stance, and resolutely struggle against all forms of hostile class ideology, criticizing the erroneous ideas of bourgeois individualism, liberalism, anarchism, nationalism, and egalitarianism. From our country's struggle against the bourgeois rightists and the socialist debate, we youth workers have especially realized that we must resolutely struggle against the tendency to get rid of the Party's leadership over the Communist Youth League, and do everything possible to ensure the closest connection between the Party and the younger generation, so that the youth become one of the most steadfast and reliable forces of the dictatorship of the proletariat.

Destroying capitalist ideas and establishing socialist ideas is of particular importance to intellectual youth. Under the socialist system, a large number of working-class intellectuals can be cultivated; but because people's consciousness often lags behind social existence, due to the influence of bourgeois ideas, and due to the differences in distribution under the principle of distribution according to work, some intellectuals with bourgeois consciousness may also appear under the socialist system. And our task is precisely to persist in ideological remolding of bourgeois intellectuals and accelerate the formation of a new contingent of working-class intellectuals. As Comrade Mao Zedong recently pointed out, in order to build socialism, the working class must have its own contingent of technical cadres, its own contingent of professors, teachers, scientists, journalists, writers, artists, and Marxist theorists. He said that the revolutionary cause of the working class will not be fully consolidated until this grand new contingent of working-class intellectuals has been formed. This is because only working-class intellectuals can fully serve to consolidate and develop the socialist economic base, and can wholeheartedly contribute their wisdom and talents to the cause of the working class. The Soviet Union has now reached the most advanced level of science and technology in the world, and was the first to successfully launch intercontinental missiles and artificial satellites. This is inseparable from the formation of a huge contingent of red intellectuals. Such intellectuals, as the Central Committee of the CPSU called on young people in 1925, the eighth year after the October Revolution, should not only "master science," but must also be "conscious builders of socialist economy and socialist culture," and must "regard themselves as an inseparable part of the working masses." This is also as our Party requires of young intellectuals, that they must be both virtuous and talented, both "red" and "expert." And in order to create such red experts, the Communist Youth League must carry out huge ideological work. There are two different paths in front of us for cultivating intellectuals. One is the bourgeois path, which is to make intellectuals divorced from politics, divorced from the masses, divorced from reality, and divorced from the leadership of the Party. Such intellectuals are full of individualistic ideas, compete for fame and gain, become arrogant and complacent with a little achievement, and even degenerate into the quagmire of anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-socialism. The other is the proletarian path, which is to combine with workers and peasants, go to labor, go to the masses, carry out arduous ideological remolding, and be constantly subjected to the leadership of Party organizations and the supervision of the masses. Such intellectuals can adhere to the working-class stance in any situation and serve the people loyally; the more knowledgeable and accomplished they are, the more they respect the leadership of the Party and the more humble and cautious they are. Obviously, only the latter path is the correct path for us to cultivate working-class intellectuals. Recently, thousands of young students, young people working in government agencies, and other young intellectuals in our country have responded to the Party's call and have gone to the countryside, construction sites, and factories to participate in physical labor. They regard this as a compulsory course for their own training and transformation, and regard obtaining the qualifications of working people as a necessary path for their advancement.

While educating young people to establish correct labor concepts and advocating the combination of intellectual youth and labor, we must also promote the spirit of hard struggle among all young people. Our country has not been liberated for long. Although our country has inexhaustible treasures and resources, the economic legacy left by the old China is very small, and our industrial base is still very weak. Under such circumstances, to build an advanced socialist country, we must save every penny and invest it in construction to accelerate national accumulation. Therefore, our Party calls on all the people to build the country diligently and thriftily, manage households diligently and thriftily, and run all undertakings diligently and thriftily. The Chinese people and the Chinese Communist Party have a good tradition of hard work and diligence. It is the source of our great strength to overcome difficulties and accelerate national construction. Our task is to educate young people to inherit and carry forward this fine tradition, and to cultivate the excellent qualities of young people of hard work, simplicity, perseverance, and vigor. To this end, our League organization is conducting education on revolutionary traditions and hard struggle to the vast number of young people. Now, this education has achieved preliminary results, and "suffering first, enjoying later" has become a fighting slogan of Chinese youth.

To educate young people in the spirit of communism also requires upholding the banner of proletarian internationalism. The cause of proletarian liberation has always been an international cause. Our Party often teaches us to love the Soviet Union and consolidate the strong unity of socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union and the working people of the world. This is the most important sign of internationalism. Our Chinese youth must inherit and develop the greatest friendship in human history forged by our predecessors and the Soviet Union, and must unswervingly consolidate unity with the youth of all socialist countries, strengthen friendly cooperation with the youth of Asian and African countries, and develop friendship with the youth of capitalist countries. Treat this as one's sacred internationalist responsibility.

The forty years since the salvo of the "Aurora" have been such a thrilling and glorious forty years, and such forty years that have inspired people to fight. In just forty years, the face of the world has undergone earth-shaking changes: backward Russia has become an advanced, powerful, and invincible Soviet Union; the red flag of socialist countries is flying over the land inhabited by one-third of humanity; and taking the socialist road has become an increasingly large and unstoppable trend in the world. Forty years ago, communism was only the great ideal of revolutionary pioneers, but forty years later, the victory of communism throughout the world is already within the scope of human vision. How many great achievements are waiting for young people to create. Let us join hands more closely, under the leadership of our most beloved Party, and advance the great cause opened up by the October Revolution to new victories!

    中国青年坚定地沿着十月革命的伟大道路前进
    胡耀邦
    中国青年以无比欢欣鼓舞的心情，热烈庆祝伟大的十月社会主义革命四十周年。我们庆祝这个光辉的节日，就是要更加坚定地沿着十月革命的伟大道路前进，同全世界进步的青年弟兄们一起，更高地举起共产主义的旗帜，走向最后的胜利。
    十月革命一声炮响，打开了人类历史的新纪元，也改变了青年运动的面貌，促进了共产主义青年运动的发展。现在，全世界已经有七十多个国家建立了共产党、工人党领导的青年组织。各个国家的共产主义青年运动由于革命运动的发展不平衡，正处在不同的历史阶段，因而担负着党所付托的不同的具体任务。然而，我们总的目标是一致的。我们的根本任务，都是以十月革命的伟大理想教育青年一代，培养争取世界和平和人类进步的突击力量，培养共产主义事业的可靠的后备部队。
    十月革命以后第一个建立的共产主义青年组织——苏联列宁共产主义青年团，按照列宁的指示进行了艰巨的工作。在十月革命以后的第三年，即1920年，列宁同志就曾经向苏联共青团员和全体青年发出这样的号召：“共青团以及所有一般想走向共产主义的青年都应当学习共产主义。”他明确地指出，共青团的任务就在于把青年男女“培养成为真正的共产主义者”。苏联共青团按照列宁的遗训，在以共产主义精神教育青年，带领青年实现党在各个时期的历史任务中，作出了光辉的贡献。四十年来，苏联共青团在共产党的领导下培养出了崭新的一代。二十年代，从战胜白匪的前线归来以后，出现了一百五十万名恢复建设工作中的青年突击手。三十年代，青年中响起了“到五年计划工地去”的口号，在荒无人烟的阿穆尔河边出现了“共青团城”。四十年代，三百五十万七千名共青团员在反对德寇的战斗中获得苏联英雄称号和各种勋章、奖章。而今天，五十年代的苏联青年，又在共产主义的建设工地上，建立着功勋，奔赴辽阔处女地的四十万青年男女是开荒运动的突击队。五枚勋章所代表的业绩和荣誉，说明苏联共青团没有辜负列宁的遗训，不愧为苏联共产党的得力助手。
    苏联共青团和青年的这些光辉事迹和突出成就，正鼓舞着各国千百万青年的斗争意志，鼓舞着我国一亿二千万青年和两千三百万共青团员的建设热情。苏联共青团向全世界显示了共产党领导下的青年共产主义者英勇无畏的面貌。中国共产主义青年团一直把苏联共青团当作自己最好的榜样和最亲密的战友。
    苏联共青团员和全体青年的这些成就，是党和团不倦地以共产主义精神进行教育的结果。共产党是最爱护青年的，希望从青年中培养出千千万万个党和人民的事业的忠实的保卫者和可靠的继承人。而只有以共产主义思想武装起来的青年，才能不辜负党的期望。苏联共青团三十九年的历史，就是在青年中为破资本主义思想，立社会主义、共产主义思想而斗争的历史。现在苏联已经进入过渡到共产主义的历史时期，剥削制度已经被连根拔掉，资产阶级思想的社会基础早已不存在。但是，苏联共青团仍然时刻警惕着国内资产阶级思想残余和国际资本主义势力所给予苏联青年的影响。为了保证青年们健康地成长，苏联共青团仍然努力同这种影响进行坚决的斗争，不断地加强思想教育工作。1954年苏联共青团举行第十二次代表大会的时候，苏共中央要求苏联共青团更加提高在对青年进行共产主义教育中的作用。今年2月，苏联共青团举行了专门讨论改进思想教育工作的中央全会。全会要求共青团组织在青年中加强劳动教育和革命传统教育，反击资产阶级的宣传阴谋。毫无疑义，这些措施一定会把苏联青年的思想觉悟提到新的高度。
    在十月革命的影响下，随着中国共产主义运动的发展，中国的共产主义青年运动也发展起来了。十月革命以后，中国共产党和中国共产主义的青年组织就不倦地在青年中传播马克思主义思想，宣传十月革命的道路。而今天，鼓舞青年坚定地沿着十月革命的道路前进，以共产主义精神教育年青一代这个根本任务，不但没有丝毫减弱，而且具有更为深刻的意义。
    今天，中国正处在向社会主义社会过渡的时期，我们虽然已经基本上完成了生产资料所有制方面的社会主义革命，但是，工人阶级和资产阶级“谁战胜谁”的问题，还没有最后解决。资产阶级力图从思想上政治上瓦解我们，麻痹我们的阶级意识，涣散我们的斗争意志。所以毛泽东同志指出，我们还必须进行一个政治上、思想上彻底的社会主义革命。完成这个革命大约需要十年到十五年的时间，目前我国人民反对资产阶级右派的斗争和社会主义大辩论，正是实现这个革命的一个具有决定意义的步骤。在这个斗争中，资产阶级千方百计地同我们争夺青年。事实证明，中国青年的最大多数是坚决拥护共产党和社会主义的，但是，由于他们绝大部分出身于农民、小资产阶级甚至资产阶级家庭，又缺少阶级斗争的锻炼，容易被资产阶级思想所俘虏。因此，在青年中破资本主义思想，立社会主义思想，就是中国共产主义青年团长期的核心工作。中国共产主义青年团必须不倦地用无产阶级的宇宙观——马克思列宁主义思想武装青年，坚定他们的工人阶级立场，并且跟形形色色的敌对阶级思想进行坚决的斗争，批判资产阶级个人主义、自由主义、无政府主义、民族主义和平均主义的错误思想。从我国反对资产阶级右派的斗争和社会主义大辩论中，我们青年工作者特别认识到必须坚决跟摆脱党对共青团的领导的倾向进行坚决的斗争，尽一切努力保证党与年轻一代最紧密的联系，使青年成为无产阶级专政最坚定、最可依靠的力量之一。
    破资本主义思想，立社会主义思想，对知识青年来说，具有特殊的重要性。在社会主义制度下，可以培养出大量的工人阶级知识分子；但是由于人们的意识经常落后于社会存在，由于资产阶级思想的影响，由于在按劳取酬原则下产生的分配上的差异，在社会主义制度下也可能出现一些具有资产阶级意识的知识分子。而我们的任务正是要坚持对资产阶级知识分子进行思想改造，并且加速工人阶级知识分子新队伍的形成。正如毛泽东同志最近所指出的，为了建成社会主义，工人阶级必须有自己的技术干部的队伍，必须有自己的教授、教员、科学家、新闻记者、文学家、艺术家和马克思主义理论家的队伍。他说，在这个工人阶级知识分子的宏大的新队伍没有造成以前，工人阶级的革命事业是不会充分巩固的。这是因为，只有工人阶级的知识分子才能充分地为巩固和发展社会主义的经济基础服务，才能全心全意地为工人阶级的事业贡献出自己的智慧和才能。苏联现在已经达到了世界上最先进的科学技术水平，第一个发射成功了洲际导弹和人造卫星，这是和巨大的红色知识分子队伍的形成分不开的。这种知识分子，正如苏共中央在十月革命后的第八年，即1925年所号召青年的那样，不仅应当“精通科学”，而且必须是“社会主义经济和社会主义文化的自觉的建设者”，必须“把自己看作劳动群众中不可分开的一部分”。这也正如我们党所要求于青年知识分子的那样，必须做到德才兼备，又“红”又“专”。而为了造就这样的红色专家，共青团必须进行巨大的思想工作。在我们面前有两种培养知识分子的不同路线。一种是资产阶级路线，就是使知识分子脱离政治，脱离群众，脱离实际，脱离党的领导。这种知识分子充满个人主义的思想，争名夺利，稍有成就就目中无人，骄傲自大，甚至堕落到反党反人民反社会主义的泥坑中去。另一种是无产阶级路线，就是同工农相结合，到劳动中去，到群众中去，进行艰苦的思想改造，经常受到党组织的领导和群众的监督。这种知识分子在任何情况下都能坚持工人阶级立场，忠诚地为人民服务；他们越是有学问有成就，就越尊重党的领导，越是谦虚谨慎。显然，只有后一条路线，才是我们培养工人阶级知识分子的正确路线。最近我国有成千上万的青年学生、机关工作青年和其他知识青年，响应党的号召，纷纷到农村、工地和工厂去参加体力劳动。他们把这看成是自己锻炼和改造的必修之课，把取得劳动人民的资格看作自己前进的必经之路。
    在教育青年树立正确的劳动观念，提倡知识青年同劳动结合的同时，我们还要在全体青年中发扬艰苦奋斗的精神。我们的国家解放还不久，我国虽然有取之不尽用之不竭的宝藏和富源，但是旧中国留下来的经济遗产很少，我们的工业基础仍然十分薄弱。在这种情况下，要建成先进的社会主义国家，就必须节约每一分资金投到建设中去，加速国家积累。所以我们党号召全体人民勤俭建国，勤俭持家，勤俭办一切事业。中国人民和中国共产党是有艰苦勤劳的好传统的。它是我们克服困难，加速国家建设的伟大力量的源泉。我们的任务就在于教育青年继承和发扬这种优良的传统，培养青年艰苦朴素、吃苦耐劳、坚韧不拔、生气勃勃的优秀品质。为此，我们团组织正在向广大青年进行革命传统和艰苦奋斗的教育。现在，这一教育已取得初步成果，“吃苦在前，享乐在后”已成为中国青年的一个战斗口号。
    以共产主义精神教育青年，也就要坚持无产阶级国际主义的旗帜。无产阶级的解放事业从来就是国际的事业。我们党经常教导我们要热爱苏联，巩固以苏联为首的社会主义各国和全世界劳动人民的坚强团结，这是国际主义的一个最重要的标志。我们中国青年一定要把我们前辈和苏联所结成的人类历史上最伟大的友谊继承下去，发展下去，一定要坚持不渝地巩固同各社会主义国家青年的团结，加强同亚非各国青年的友好合作，发展同资本主义各国青年的友谊，把这当作自己神圣的国际主义责任。
      “阿芙乐尔”号响起炮声以来的四十年，是多么惊心动魄和光辉灿烂的四十年，是多么鼓舞人们斗争的四十年。短短的四十年，世界的面貌已经发生了翻天复地的变化：落后的俄国变成了先进的、强大的、不可战胜的苏联；社会主义国家的红旗飘扬在三分之一人类居住的土地上；走社会主义的路，已经在世界形成越来越大的、不可阻挡的潮流。四十年前，共产主义还只是革命先驱的伟大理想，而四十年后的今天，共产主义在全世界的胜利已经是在人类的视野之内了。多少丰功伟绩在等待着青年们去创立。让我们更紧密地携起手来，在我们最亲爱的党的领导下，把十月革命所开辟的伟大事业推进到新的胜利！
