Xinhua News Agency dispatch, November 5th: The news of the Soviet Union launching its second artificial satellite has caused panic in the American government. Some Washington officials are also attempting to cover up America's failure in the satellite field with arguments like "there's nothing great about it." According to a correspondent for the British "Daily Express" in the United States, these people reflect "a very strong sour grapes mentality" (note: Aesop's fable: the fox couldn't reach the grapes, so he said they were sour). He said: "I believe if the United States had the British system of government, Eisenhower would be out of office tomorrow. That's the miserable and serious situation the United States finds itself in today."

White House spokeswoman Mrs. Whitman said on the 4th that Eisenhower, shortly after receiving the news of the Soviet Union launching its second satellite on the morning of the 3rd, held telephone discussions with several scientific advisors and national security advisors. These discussions continued on the morning of the 4th. Mrs. Whitman stated that the American government is carefully studying the achievement of the Soviet Union in launching its second satellite to determine its implications in rocketry and to study its scientific significance.

Mrs. Whitman also announced that Eisenhower had decided to convene a special cabinet meeting on the 5th, and the regular meeting on Friday would also be held as scheduled.

According to a Reuters reporter, the political atmosphere in Washington now forces Eisenhower to pay more open attention to the satellite issue than before. Senators and Representatives are increasingly determined to demand that the Eisenhower government "take bold steps to deal with the impact of the Russians' repeated victories. Now one can hear the demand: 'If necessary,' the government should ask taxpayers to 'make some sacrifices.'"

According to Agence France-Presse, Eisenhower summoned the Director of the Budget on the 4th for this reason. At the same time, the American government intends to take the opportunity to accelerate its plan to "reallocate responsibilities among allies to strengthen Western defense."

Senators Mahoney, Kefauver, and others have all demanded that Eisenhower convene a special session of Congress to discuss "why the United States has fallen behind the Soviet Union in space research."

Senator Bridges has demanded that the Department of Defense establish a "missile czar" to manage America's missile program. Johnson has called for a "bold new consideration" of American defense and foreign policy.

More congressmen are using the Soviet satellite as an excuse to demand that the government accelerate the development of missiles. Senator Symington said that the Soviet Union's launch of the satellite shows that "the United States is at least two years behind the Soviet Union in missile development," and he demanded that the government pay attention to taking "action."

At the same time, American news agencies and newspapers have commented on it one after another. Many newspapers believe that Americans are both admiring the Soviet Union's scientific achievements and feeling very frustrated because American scientists have not yet been able to launch their first artificial satellite. "The Washington Post" said: "Like the first artificial satellite, the Russian scientists who took this courageous new step towards the stars should be congratulated and respected by mankind." The Washington "Daily News" used a helpless headline on the front page, called: "When Do We Start?" A Reuters reporter said that this headline typically reflects "the signs of frustration that are clearly visible in the comments published by American radio, television, and newspapers."

Amid the uproar of public opinion, the newly appointed Secretary of Defense McElroy and a group of experts from the Department of Defense gave a detailed report on the progress of American missiles to the leaders of the Senate on the 4th. The news said that McElroy originally intended to limit the report to the development of American missiles, but the senators pressed him closely on the Soviet Union's plans. Senate Democratic Leader Johnson said after listening to the report that the report did not convince him that the American plan was not lagging behind Russia.

### 有的人急惶惶　有的人酸溜溜  新的红月亮恼煞了美国老爷  许多议员喊叫加紧剥削纳税人来发展导弹

    有的人急惶惶　有的人酸溜溜
    新的红月亮恼煞了美国老爷
    许多议员喊叫加紧剥削纳税人来发展导弹
    本报综合报道　据新华社5日讯：苏联发射第二颗人造卫星的消息已经引起了美国政府的慌乱。还有一些华盛顿官员企图用“那有什么了不起”的论调来掩盖美国在卫星方面的失败。据英国“每日快报”驻美记者说，这些人反映了“十分厉害的酸葡萄心情”（注——寓言：狐狸吃不到葡萄，就说葡萄是酸的。）他说：“我相信如果美国有英国的政府制度的话，艾森豪威尔会在明天下台，这是美国今天发现自己所处的悲惨和严重的处境。”
    白宫发言人惠吞夫人4日说：艾森豪威尔3日清晨，收到苏联发射第二颗卫星的消息后不久，就同几个科学顾问和国家安全顾问进行了电话商谈。在4日清晨，又继续进行这种商谈。惠吞夫人表示，美国政府正在仔细研究苏联发射第二颗卫星的成就，以断定它在火箭学上的含意和研究它在科学上的意义。
    惠吞夫人还宣布，艾森豪威尔决定在5日召开一次内阁特别会议，星期五的例会也将照常举行。
    据路透社记者指出：华盛顿现在的政治气氛迫使艾森豪威尔不能不比以前更加公开地注意卫星问题。参议员们和众议员们愈来愈加坚决地要求艾森豪威尔政府“采取大胆的步骤，来对付俄国人几次胜利的影响。现在可以听到这种要求：‘如果必要’，政府应该要求纳税人‘作些牺牲’”。
    据法新社报道，艾森豪威尔为此已经在4日召见了预算局长。同时，美国政府还打算趁机会加紧进行“把盟国之间的责任加以重新分配以加强西方防务”的计划。
    美国参议员马洪尼、克弗维尔等都要求艾森豪威尔召开国会特别会议来讨论“在宇宙空间研究工作方面美国为什么落在苏联后面”。
    参议员布利奇斯要求国防部设一个“导弹沙皇”来掌管美国的导弹计划。约翰逊要求对美国国防和外交政策作“大胆的新考虑”。
    更多的议员以苏联卫星为借口要求政府加紧发展导弹。参议员薛明顿说，苏联发射卫星表明“美国在导弹发展方面至少落后于苏联两年”，他要求政府注意采取“行动”。
    与此同时，美国各通讯社和报纸纷纷加以评论。许多报纸认为，美国人一方面对苏联的科学成就感到钦佩，另一方面又十分懊丧，因为美国科学家还没有能够发射出自己的第一颗人造卫星。“华盛顿邮报”说：“正像第一颗人造卫星一样，向星星跨出这一个勇敢的新的一步的俄国科学家应当受到人类的祝贺和尊敬。”华盛顿“每日新闻”在头版用了一个无可奈何的大标题，叫做：“我们什么时候开始？”路透社记者说，这个标题典型地表现了“美国电台、电视和报纸所发表的评论中明显地看得出来的心情沮丧的迹象”。
    在舆论大哗声中，新上任的国防部长麦克艾罗伊和国防部一批专家在4日就美国的导弹进展情况向参议院的领导人们作了详细汇报。消息说，麦克艾罗伊本来打算把汇报限于美国的导弹发展情况，但是参议员们却紧紧的追问着关于苏联的计划。参议院民主党领袖约翰逊在听完汇报以后说，这次汇报并没有使他相信美国的计划不落在俄国后面。
