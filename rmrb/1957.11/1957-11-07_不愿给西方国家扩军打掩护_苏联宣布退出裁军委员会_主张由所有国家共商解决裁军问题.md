Xinhua News Agency, New York, November 6th: According to TASS, on November 4th, Kuznetsov, head of the Soviet delegation to the 12th session of the United Nations General Assembly, stated during the continued discussion of the disarmament issue in the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly that the Soviet government believes that all avenues for conducting effective work using the Disarmament Subcommittee have been exhausted. Under these circumstances, the Soviet government believes that continuing to participate in the work of the Disarmament Committee and its subcommittee is meaningless. Therefore, the Soviet government declares that if the composition of the Disarmament Committee and its subcommittee remains the same, the Soviet Union will not participate in the United Nations Disarmament Committee and its subcommittee.

In the opening part of his statement, Kuznetsov reviewed the past efforts made by the Soviet Union in the Disarmament Committee and its subcommittee, and exposed the various obstructions and sabotage carried out by Western countries to hinder the reaching of a disarmament agreement. He pointed out that the disarmament issue is a modern and most important issue of global concern, which should be constantly placed under the supervision of all countries in the world, and it should be ensured that all countries, large and small, can participate in the discussion of this issue and participate in the formulation of solutions to this issue.

Kuznetsov continued by saying that the negotiating experience of the United Nations Disarmament Committee and its subcommittee shows that these institutions are incapable of ensuring the promotion of the solution to the disarmament issue. Four of the five members of the subcommittee are major participants in the aggressive North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and the countries participating in this group, as publicly admitted in the Eisenhower-Macmillan Communiqué, consider strengthening the arms race and possessing nuclear weapons as the only hope in the policies they pursue. Therefore, one cannot expect the subcommittee to solve the disarmament issue. He pointed out that the United Nations Disarmament Committee and its subcommittee have already lost credibility among the people of the world. Maintaining these two institutions will only benefit those who are wholeheartedly trying to continue expanding their armaments. The negotiations of these two institutions are merely being used by the United States and other Western countries as a guise to cover up their continued arms expansion.

Kuznetsov said that therefore, the Soviet government has decided not to participate in the work of the Disarmament Committee and its subcommittee, and suggests establishing a broadly representative United Nations body—a United Nations Standing Disarmament Committee composed of all United Nations member states—and entrusting the disarmament issue to this body for discussion.

The Soviet representative said that at present, everything is possible to quickly resolve the disarmament issue. The proposals submitted by the Soviet Union to the 12th session of the United Nations General Assembly for review open the way for taking concrete measures in disarmament quickly. The Soviet government is willing to immediately sign agreements with other countries based on the aforementioned proposals. The Soviet Union is also willing to study proposals put forward by other countries aimed at stopping the arms race and eliminating the danger of atomic war. The Soviet Union still insists on advocating disarmament, and will continue to make unremitting efforts in the future to break the long-standing deadlock in disarmament negotiations, strive to stop the arms race, and strive to ease international tensions. The establishment of a permanent disarmament committee composed of all member states of the United Nations can bring hope to disarmament negotiations, make it possible to comprehensively study the disarmament issue in consideration of the opinions of all countries, and determine concrete measures to solve this major issue that is closely related to the people of all countries in the world.

    不愿给西方国家扩军打掩护
    苏联宣布退出裁军委员会
    主张由所有国家共商解决裁军问题
    新华社6日讯　据塔斯社纽约5日讯：出席联合国大会第十二届会议的苏联代表团团长库兹涅佐夫11月4日在联合国大会政治委员会继续讨论裁军问题时，发表声明说，苏联政府认为，目前想利用裁军小组委员会来进行有成效的工作的一切办法都已经想尽了。在这种情况下，苏联政府认为继续参加裁军委员会及其小组委员会的工作是没有意义的。因此苏联政府声明，如果裁军委员会及其小组委员会的组成还是原有的成员，苏联将不参加联合国裁军委员会及其小组委员会。
    库兹涅佐夫在声明的开头部分追述了苏联过去在裁军委员会及其小组委员会中所作的努力，并且揭露了西方国家为阻挠达成裁军协议而进行的种种阻挠破坏。他指出，裁军问题是一个举世关心的现代最重要的问题，这个问题应当经常置于世界各国监督之下，而且应当保证使所有大小国家都能够参加讨论这个问题，和参加制定解决这一问题的办法。
    库兹涅佐夫接着说，联合国裁军委员会及其小组委员会的谈判经验表明，这些机构无力保证推动裁军问题的解决。小组委员会五个成员中有四个是侵略性北大西洋集团的主要参加者，而参加这个集团的国家又正如艾森豪威尔—麦克米伦会谈公报中所公开承认的，认为加强军备竞赛和拥有核武器是它们所实行的政策中的唯一希望，因此，不能指望小组委员会去解决裁军问题。他指出，联合国裁军委员会及其小组委员会目前已经在世界各国人民中丧失了威信，保持这两个机构只会对那些一心一意想继续扩充军备的人有利。这两个机构的谈判不过是被美国和其他西方国家利用来掩饰继续扩充军备的幌子。
    库兹涅佐夫说，因此，苏联政府决定不参加裁军委员会及其小组委员会的工作，并且建议设立一个具有广泛代表性的联合国机构——联合国全体会员国组成的联合国常设裁军委员会，并且把裁军问题交给这个机构来讨论。
    苏联代表说，目前是有一切可能来迅速解决裁军问题的。苏联提交联合国大会第十二届会议审查的建议给迅速在裁军方面采取具体措施开辟了道路。苏联政府愿意根据上述建议同其他国家立即签订协定。苏联也愿意研究其他国家提出的目的在于停止军备竞赛和消除原子战争危险的建议。苏联仍然坚持主张裁军，今后还要努力不懈地为打开长时期以来一直存在的裁军谈判的僵局和争取停止军备竞赛和争取缓和国际紧张局势而奋斗。成立由联合国所有会员国组成的常设裁军委员会，就可以给裁军谈判带来希望，使得有可能在考虑各国意见的情况下全面地研究裁军问题，可以定出具体的措施来解决这个与世界各国人民休戚相关的重大问题。
