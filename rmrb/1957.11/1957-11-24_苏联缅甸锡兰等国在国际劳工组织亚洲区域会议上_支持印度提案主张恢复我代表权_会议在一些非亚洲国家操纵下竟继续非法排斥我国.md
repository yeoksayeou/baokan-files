Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, November 23rd. The plenary session of the Fourth Asian Regional Conference of the International Labor Organization (ILO) on the afternoon of the 22nd, with the participation of some non-Asian countries in the voting, illegally rejected a proposal by the Indian delegate to allow representatives from the People’s Republic of China to attend the conference.

Shortly after the conference opened on November 13th, the Indian government delegation put forward this proposal. The proposal stated: "The value of the conclusions reached by the conference will be diminished without the participation of genuine representatives from one of the largest countries in the Asian region." However, the Selection Committee decided on the 21st, based on a motion by Mr. Mitsuki, the Japanese employer representative, to postpone consideration of this issue. This motion was passed with twelve votes in favor, nine votes against, and five abstentions.

At the plenary session on the afternoon of the 22nd, Abid Ali, the Indian government representative, reiterated his request to discuss this issue. He said it was regrettable that such an important issue was decided to be postponed for discussion. He asked the general assembly to reject the decision of the Selection Committee and to consider the proposal put forward by India. The Indian suggestion was seconded by the Ceylon delegation.

The Japanese government representative, on the pretext that "this is a purely political issue," reiterated Japan's opposition to the Indian proposal. The Philippine government representative echoed this sentiment.

The Soviet government representative Morozov and the worker representative Egurazdov warmly supported the Indian proposal. Morozov pointed out that if only representatives from Asian countries had voted in the Selection Committee, then the Selection Committee would have actively supported the discussion of the Indian proposal. He said: "The intolerable situation where 600 million Chinese people cannot send representatives to participate in conferences related to Asian issues should now be ended."

U Law Chit, the Burmese government representative who chaired the Selection Committee meeting on the 21st, reminded the representatives: "There are certain forces outside of Asia that hope the People's Republic of China will disappear; but their fantasies cannot erase the facts." He requested that representatives who do not belong to the Asian region not vote on this issue, and he asked government delegations from countries that have diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China to support the Indian proposal.

Ceylon's worker representative Aziz exposed the motion made by the Japanese employer under the so-called "political" pretext to avoid discussing this important issue. He said: "Not allowing China to have representation is precisely a political action, while letting representatives of the People's Republic of China represent China here is merely acknowledging the facts. It is noteworthy that those who refuse to discuss the Indian proposal are led by the employers and supported by the United Kingdom government representatives." He asked: Who can say that a conference discussing Asian economic and social issues can exclude so many Asian people from China?

The Indian worker representative Vasavada also spoke, requesting a discussion of this proposal.

The conference rejected the Indian proposal. There were twenty votes in favor, forty-six votes against, and nine abstentions. Each government delegation had two votes, and employer and worker delegations each had one vote. Those who voted against included representatives from non-Asian countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom, New Zealand, and Australia. Many employer representatives also voted against. Countries supporting the Indian proposal included Burma, Ceylon, Indonesia, and the Soviet Union. Pakistan abstained.

Following the International Red Cross Conference held in New Delhi not long ago, this is the second time within a month that the issue of restoring China's legitimate representation has been raised at an international conference. Socialist countries, major countries in the Asian and African regions, and upright people attending these international conferences have supported the demand to restore China's legitimate representation. Indian public opinion is paying close attention to this discussion, and newspapers have continuously published news about the issue of China's legitimate representation at this conference.

    苏联缅甸锡兰等国在国际劳工组织亚洲区域会议上
    支持印度提案主张恢复我代表权
    会议在一些非亚洲国家操纵下竟继续非法排斥我国
    新华社新德里23日电　国际劳工组织第四届亚洲区域会议全体大会22日下午在一些非亚洲国家参加投票的情况下，非法地否决了印度代表提出的要求由中华人民共和国代表出席会议的提案。
    在11月13日会议开幕以后不久，印度政府代表团就提出了这项提案。提案说：“没有亚洲区域最大国家之一的真正的代表参加，会议作出的结论的价值将会受到损失。”但是提案选择委员会21日还是根据日本雇主代表三城的动议而决定暂不考虑这一问题。这项动议是以十二票赞成、九票反对、五票弃权通过的。
    在22日下午的全体会议上，印度政府代表阿比德·阿里重新要求讨论这一问题。他说，这样重要的一个问题竟被决定暂不讨论，这是令人遗憾的。他要求大会拒绝提案选择委员会的决定，并且考虑印度提出的提案。印度的建议得到锡兰代表团的附议。
    日本政府代表借口“这是纯粹政治性的问题”，重申日本反对印度的提案。菲律宾政府代表随声附和。
    苏联政府代表莫罗佐夫和工人代表埃古拉兹多夫热烈地支持印度提案。莫罗佐夫指出，如果在提案选择委员会投票的只有亚洲国家的代表，那么提案选择委员会是会积极地支持讨论印度提案的。他说：“六亿中国人民不能派代表参加有关亚洲问题的会议——这种不能容忍的局面现在应该结束了。”
    在提案选择委员会21日的会议上担任主席的缅甸政府代表吴拉实提醒代表们说：“亚洲以外有某些力量希望中华人民共和国烟消云散；但他们的幻想是无法抹煞事实的。”他要求不属于亚洲区域的代表不要在这个问题上投票，并且要求同中华人民共和国有外交关系的各国政府代表团支持印度的提案。
    锡兰工人代表阿齐兹揭露了日本雇主在所谓“政治性”的借口下提出的避免讨论这一个重大问题的动议。他说：“不让中国有代表权正是政治性的行动，而让中华人民共和国的代表在这里代表中国只是承认事实。拒绝讨论印度提案的人们是以雇主为首的，而且受到联合王国政府代表的支持，这一点是值得注意的。”他问道：有什么人能够说，讨论亚洲经济和社会问题的会议可以排斥中国这样多的亚洲人民呢？
    印度工人代表瓦萨瓦达也发言要求讨论这项提案。
    会议否决了印度提案。赞成的有二十票，反对的有四十六票，弃权的有九票。每一个政府代表团有两票表决权，雇主和工人代表团各有一票。投反对票的有美国、英国、新西兰、澳大利亚这样一些非亚洲国家的代表。很多雇主代表也投了反对票。支持印度提案的有缅甸、锡兰、印度尼西亚和苏联等国。巴基斯坦弃权。
    继不久以前在新德里举行的国际红十字大会以后，这是在一个月以内第二次在国际会议上提出恢复中国的合法代表权的问题。各社会主义国家、亚非地区主要国家以及出席这些国际会议的正直人士都支持恢复中国合法代表权的要求。印度舆论十分注意这种讨论，报纸连续发表了有关中国在这个会议上的合法代表权问题的消息。
