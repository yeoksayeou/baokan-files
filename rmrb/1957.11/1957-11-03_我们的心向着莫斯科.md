    Our Hearts Turn to Moscow

    The Chinese delegation, headed by Chairman Mao Zedong, arrived in Moscow yesterday. They brought with them the lofty respect, heartfelt gratitude, and greatest congratulations of our country's 600 million people and the 12 million members of the Communist Party of China, to participate in the upcoming grand celebration of the 40th anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution.

    This is Chairman Mao's second visit to the Soviet Union. At the end of 1949 and the beginning of 1950, Chairman Mao visited the Soviet Union for the first time and signed the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance with the Soviet government, establishing a great fraternal alliance of comprehensive cooperation and mutual support between the people of China and the Soviet Union. This is an unprecedented, powerful, and unbreakable alliance. Over the past eight years, the people of China and the Soviet Union have achieved brilliant new accomplishments in the cause of socialist and communist construction, and have also made tremendous contributions to the common cause of defending world peace and promoting human progress. Now, Chairman Mao is leading the Chinese delegation to the Soviet Union again to celebrate the October Revolution, the greatest festival of mankind, together with the Soviet people. This will undoubtedly further strengthen and develop the great fraternal alliance between our two peoples.

    Chairman Mao's visit to the Soviet Union this time, representing all members of the Communist Party of China and the entire Chinese people, is to congratulate the great Soviet people, the Soviet government, and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on the victorious festival of the October Revolution, to congratulate them on the brilliant achievements of Soviet communist construction, and to thank the Soviet people for their profound friendship and selfless assistance to our country. The Chinese people deeply realize that the victory of the Chinese people's revolution and the achievements of socialist construction have followed the path of theOctober Revolution. We have always regarded the Chinese people's revolution as a continuation of the October Revolution, and the victorious festival of the October Revolution as our own victorious festival. The Chinese people also deeply realize that the existence of the powerful socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and its support for the Chinese revolution, as well as the comprehensive, enormous, and selfless assistance of the Soviet people to our country's construction, are important factors for the great victory of the Chinese people's revolution and important conditions for the great achievements of our country's socialist construction. At present, as the birthday of the first socialist country is approaching, and as the festival of the new century of mankind is approaching, the Chinese people are launching an unprecedented celebration upsurge throughout the country. This fully expresses the Chinese people's respect and gratitude to the Soviet people, and also fully embodies the unparalleled and profound friendship between our two peoples. This great friendship between our two peoples is established under the guidance of the principle of proletarian internationalism and on the basis of the fundamental interests of the two peoples being consistent. Therefore, it is eternal and unbreakable. The imperialists are trying every possible means to provoke and undermine our friendship, and to find so-called "cracks" between our two countries. This is just wishful thinking and a waste of effort!

    The victorious festival of the October Revolution is also the victorious festival of the working people all over the world. The working people all over the world have also launched celebrations to celebrate this great festival. Leaders of the world proletariat and representatives of the working people will gather in Moscow. This is a symbol of the great international unity of the world proletariat and a great review of the world communist forces. At present, the proletariat has won victory in thirteen countries on Earth. The socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union already has more than one-third of the world's population and more than one-quarter of the world's land. It is geographically connected, politically united, and economically mutually supported. It has become a powerful fortress for world peace and the cause of human progress, demonstrating a bright future to the working people of all countries. At the same time, socialist ideas are deeply rooted in the hearts of people all over the world, and the world workers' movement has developed unprecedentedly. All of this vividly shows that the light of the October Revolution shines all over the world, and Marxism-Leninism has achieved a great victory all over the world. This time, the great meeting of leaders and representatives of the proletariat of all countries in Moscow will undoubtedly further strengthen the great unity of the world proletariat and the communist movement, and further promote world peace and the cause of human progress.

    On the eve of this great festival, the hearts of the Chinese people are turning to Moscow. Chairman Mao said at the Moscow airport: The people of China and the Soviet Union "have formed a brotherly alliance in the common struggle. No force in the world can separate us." "We will always stand together and fight for world peace and the victory of our common cause." These words of Chairman Mao fully express the heartfelt wishes and firm will of our country's 600 million people. We cheer for the unbreakable great fraternal alliance between China and the Soviet Union! We cheer for the victorious struggle of the 800 million people of China and the Soviet Union forever together!

    我们的心向着莫斯科
    以毛泽东主席为首的中国代表团，已经在昨天到达莫斯科了。他们带去了我国六亿人民和中国共产党的一千二百万党员的崇高的敬意、衷心的感激和最大的祝贺，去参加即将到来的伟大的十月社会主义革命四十周年庆祝盛典。
    毛泽东主席到苏联，这是第二次了。1949年底、1950年初，毛主席第一次访问苏联，并同苏联政府签订了中苏友好同盟互助条约，建立了中苏两国人民全面合作、互相支援的伟大的兄弟联盟。这是史无前例的强大的牢不可破的联盟。八年来，中苏两国人民在社会主义和共产主义的建设事业中，都取得了辉煌的新成就，在保卫世界和平和促进人类进步的共同事业中，也作出了巨大的贡献。现在，毛主席又率领中国代表团前往苏联，同苏联人民一道庆祝十月革命这个人类最伟大的节日。这无疑将更进一步加强和发展我们两国人民伟大的兄弟联盟。
    毛主席这一次到苏联，代表中国共产党全体党员和全中国人民，向伟大的苏联人民、苏联政府和苏联共产党祝贺十月革命的胜利节日，祝贺苏联共产主义建设的光辉成就，并感谢苏联人民对我国的崇高友谊和无私援助。中国人民深切地认识到，中国人民革命的胜利和社会主义建设的成就，是沿着十月革命的道路取得的。我们从来就把中国人民革命看作是十月革命的继续，把十月革命的胜利节日看作是自己的胜利节日。中国人民也深切地认识到，以苏联为首的强大的社会主义阵营的存在和对中国革命的支持，苏联人民对我国建设的全面、巨大、无私的援助，是中国人民革命取得伟大胜利的重要因素，是我国社会主义建设取得伟大成就的重要条件。目前，当第一个社会主义国家的生日快要到来的时候，当人类新世纪的节日快要到来的时候，中国人民正在全国各地展开规模空前的庆祝热潮。这充分表达了我国六亿人民对苏联人民的崇敬和感激的心情，也充分体现了我们两国人民的无比深厚的友谊。我们两国人民的这种伟大友谊，是在无产阶级国际主义原则的指导下，在两国人民根本利益一致的基础上建立起来的，因此是永恒的和牢不可破的。帝国主义者千方百计地企图挑拨和破坏我们这种友谊，企图在我们两国之间找寻什么“裂痕”，这不过是白日做梦，枉费心机！
    十月革命的胜利节日，同时也是全世界劳动人民的胜利节日。世界各地的劳动人民也已展开了庆祝活动，欢庆这一伟大的节日。全世界无产阶级的领袖和劳动人民的代表，将云集莫斯科。这是世界无产阶级国际大团结的标志，是世界共产主义力量的大检阅。目前，无产阶级已经在地球上十三个国家获得了胜利。以苏联为首的社会主义阵营，已拥有全世界三分之一以上的人口和四分之一以上的土地，在地理上联成一片，在政治上团结一致，在经济上互相支援，已成为世界和平和人类进步事业的强大堡垒，向各国劳动人民展示了光辉的前景。同时，社会主义思想正在全世界深入人心，世界工人运动已有了空前的发展。这一切生动地表明：十月革命的光芒普照全世界，马克思列宁主义已在全世界取得了伟大的胜利。这一次世界各国无产阶级的领袖和代表在莫斯科的大会师，无疑将会进一步加强世界无产阶级和共产主义运动的伟大团结，更加促进世界和平和人类进步事业的向前发展。
    在这伟大节日的前夕，中国人民的心都向往着莫斯科。毛主席在莫斯科机场上说：中苏“两国人民已经在共同的斗争中结成了兄弟般的同盟。世界上没有任何力量可以把我们分开”。“我们将永远站在一起，为着世界和平和我们共同事业的胜利而奋斗。”毛主席的这些话充分表达了我国六亿人民的衷心愿望和坚决意志。我们为中苏两国牢不可破的伟大的兄弟联盟欢呼！我们为中苏八亿人民永远在一起进行共同的胜利的斗争欢呼！
