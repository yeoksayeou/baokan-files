    "Ten Thousand Li of Wind and Thunder Satisfy Lofty Aspirations"
    Tian Han
    I boarded the "Tu" type passenger plane with great excitement. On both sides of the nose of this giant jet airliner are the initials of its designer, Tupolev - "Tu" (TY). People also call it "Tu". So, in my previous letter's poem, I said: "A report of 'Tu' arrives, all brows are smoothed."
    The fuselage is wider than ordinary planes, with seven seats across, four on the right and three on the left, accommodating more than seventy passengers. We were honored to be on the same plane as our military delegation, but even the two groups combined did not fill the plane. The "Tu" flies both fast and steadily. From Irkutsk to Moscow, over ten thousand li, it only took five or six hours, including rest stops for refueling. Of course, it also flies high, often above nine thousand meters. People admire the high white clouds, but it flies even a thousand zhang higher than the clouds. Therefore, at first, I could still survey the beautiful mountains and rivers of Eastern Siberia, but later, besides the blue sky and white clouds, I couldn't see anything else, so I had to steal time to read. Comrade Qian Junrui, anxious while waiting for the plane in Irkutsk, wrote a "Remembering Wangsun" poem:
    "Clear sky for ten thousand li, flying here,
    Fortieth anniversary, all rejoice.
    Snowflakes bloom by the surging city.
    I hate the heavens,
    Why so heartlessly arranged!"
    "Surging city" refers to Irkutsk. The original meaning of the Irkut River in the Buryat Mongol language is "surging" or "fiery." I was inspired to compose a poem in response:
    "Famous city, accompanied again,
    Ten thousand li of wind and thunder satisfy lofty aspirations,
    The capital of Moscow blooms with flowers tonight.
    May our wishes not be in vain,
    Party members always overcome all difficulties."
    Comrade Ye Jianying read it and also composed a poem in response, saying:
    "Jet plane breaking through clouds celebrates its arrival,
    If Lenin were here, he would be comforted,
    Struggle is also opening towards the moon.
    Praising its superiority,
    The Western world suffers to arrange."
    Comrade Jianying mentioned the moon because Comrade Junrui also had two "Ugly Slaves," writing from artificial satellites to the contrast between the two worlds:
    "Why are ten thousand families laughing?
    Fortieth anniversary, fortieth anniversary;
    Universal harmony arrives on earth.
    Pity the guests on Wall Street,
    Frowning, frowning,
    Facing the satellite, worrying in vain."
    Therefore, I also composed two poems in response:
    "The ice wheel shines in every home,
    First this year, hundredth next year;
    From now on, humans travel in space."
    "Who will be the first to land on the moon?
    Pounding medicine in the mortar, breaking cassia branches,
    Quickly relieve Chang'e's eternal sorrow."
    The latter poem naturally hopes that our country's industrial circles and scientists will quickly catch up, not falling behind in interstellar space activities. It is said that American monopoly capitalists are already trying to monopolize real estate on the moon, but everyone knows that, according to legend, the first to land on the moon was clearly China's Chang'e, as well as the Jade Rabbit, Wu Gang, and the like, and everyone knows that our Tang Emperor also traveled on the moon. Poets, understanding that Chang'e would find it hard to endure the cold and loneliness in the jade palaces after flying to the moon, thus have famous lines such as "Chang'e should regret stealing the elixir, her heart yearning night after night for the blue sea and blue sky." Shouldn't we, following the Soviet Union, fly to the moon as soon as possible to comfort Chang'e's loneliness?
    This time, Chairman Mao personally came to the Soviet Union to celebrate the fortieth anniversary of the October Revolution. The Soviet side originally prepared a grand welcome, but Chairman Mao repeatedly declined. Comrade Deng Xiaoping said to us: "This is entirely right. What is there for us to be proud of? The Soviet Union already has artificial satellites 1,700 kilometers off the ground, and we don't even have one that is one chi off the ground." These words are truly inspiring.
    After resting and refueling in Omsk, the "Tu" flew to Moscow in one breath. When the plane tilted its right wing and dived into the dense clouds to land, it groped in the thick fog for a while until the airport was vaguely visible when it was very close to the ground. At this time, I deeply felt that the Soviet aviation authorities' cautious attitude, insisting that we stay in Irkutsk for two days, was entirely correct. Later, I learned that the day before us, when the Romanian guests arrived, the plane crashed while landing due to even worse visibility.
    After receiving a warm reception from the Soviet Trade Union Congress, and accepting their proposal, we went directly to the Lenin Central Stadium to participate in the meeting of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union celebrating the fortieth anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution instead of going to the hotel. We arrived late and missed the reports of Comrade Khrushchev and Chairman Mao. We only heard a passage from Chairman Mao on the radio as the transport vehicle drove towards the city. When we arrived at the venue, it was the leaders of the parties of the Eastern European brotherly countries speaking. From afar, we saw Chairman Mao and Mr. Song Qingling sitting next to Comrade Khrushchev.
    Comrade Yang Shangkun, Comrade Mao Dun, and Counselor Zhang Yingwu of the embassy all came to find us. This was not just meeting old acquaintances in a foreign land; here we also met some old warriors whom we had been familiar with in the peace movement and the socialist revolution movement. Regardless of their skin color, nationality, or gender, we were all moving towards a great goal, the complete liberation of mankind, and a more beautiful and larger-scale life. I said to Mr. Mei Lanfang: "Don't you think this is truly a great internationalist meeting? Through this meeting, our confidence has been increased a hundredfold?" Mr. Mei strongly agreed, and he will broadcast this meaning to the motherland.

### “万里风雷惬壮怀”

    “万里风雷惬壮怀”
    田汉
    以十分兴奋的心情上了“图”式客机。这巨型喷气式客机的机首两侧，留下了它的设计者图波列夫名字的首音——“图”（TY）。人们也就叫它“图”。所以我在前信诗里说：“一报‘图’来尽展眉。”
    机身较普通飞机宽，除通路外横排七座，右四左三，可以坐七十多位乘客。我们荣幸地跟我国军事代表团同机，但两方面合起来也没有把飞机坐满。“图”就是飞得又快又稳，从伊城到莫斯科一万几百华里，它连休息加油在内，五六个小时就到了。当然它也飞得高。经常在九千公尺以上。人们都羡慕白云高，它更高出白云千丈。因此起先我还能纵览东西伯利亚山川之胜，后来除青霄白云以外什么也看不到了，只好偷空看书。钱俊瑞同志因在伊城候机焦急，曾写了一首忆王孙词：
    “晴空万里飞将来，四十周年齐畅怀。汹涌城边雪花开。恨天爷，底事无情恁安排！”
    “汹涌城”是指伊尔库次克，伊尔库特河按布利亚特蒙古语的原义是“汹涌”或“火热”的意思。我乘兴和了一首：
    “名城结伴又重来，万里风雷惬壮怀、莫京今夜百花开。愿未乖，党人常把万难排”。
    叶剑英同志看了，也和了一首说：
    “喷气排云庆祝来，列宁如在慰胸怀，斗争又向月球开。夸优越，西方世界苦安排”。剑英同志之所以谈到月球，是因俊瑞同志另有两首“丑奴儿”，从人造卫星写到两个世界的对比：
    “万家欢笑缘何事？四十周年，四十周年；世界大同到人间。可怜华尔街头客，紧皱眉头，紧皱眉头，对着卫星空发愁。”
    因此我也和了两首：
    “冰轮射出家家见，第一今年，第百来年；从此人行宇宙间。”
    “月球登陆谁为首？捣药池头，折桂枝头，速解姮嫦万古愁。”
    后一首自然是希望我国工业界和科学家急起直追，在星际空间活动方面不落人后。据说美国垄断资本家已经在企图垄断月球上的房地产，殊不知在传说上第一次登陆月球的分明是中国的嫦娥，还有玉兔，吴刚之流，而且谁都知道我国唐明皇还曾在月球旅行过的。诗人们体贴到嫦娥飞到月宫后琼楼玉宇间清冷寂寞难于忍受，因而有“嫦娥应悔偷灵药，碧海青天夜夜心”一类的名句。我们不应该追随苏联之后早日飞到月宫慰嫦娥们的寂寞吗？
    这次毛主席亲自到苏联来庆祝十月革命四十周年。苏联方面原准备了极盛大的欢迎，但毛主席都再三婉辞了。邓小平同志对我们说：“这是完全应该的。有什么值得我们骄傲的呢？苏联已经有离地一千七百公里的人造卫星，我们连离地一尺的也没有。”这话真值得我们感奋。
    在鄂木斯克休息加油之后，“图”一气飞到了莫斯科。飞机掀起右翼，钻进深密的云层要降落的时候，好一阵子在浓雾中摸索，直到离地极近的时候机场才模糊在望。这时我才深感苏联航空方面采取那样慎重的态度，硬让我们在伊尔库次克住两天，是完全对的。后来才知道前我们一天罗马尼亚客人们到达的时候，由于视度更差，飞机竟在着陆的时候失了事。
    受了苏联总工会的热烈的招待，也接受他们的提议，我们不到旅馆，径到列宁中央运动场的体育馆参加苏联最高苏维埃庆祝十月社会主义革命四十周年会议。我们到迟了，已经赶不上听赫鲁晓夫同志和毛主席的报告。仅在交通车向市区驶进中由无线电里听了毛主席的一段话。到会场的时候正是东欧兄弟国家的党的领袖们在说话，我们从远处看到主席和宋庆龄先生坐在赫鲁晓夫同志旁边。
    杨尚昆同志，茅盾同志，和大使馆的张映吾参赞都来找我们，这不止是他乡遇故知，我们在这里还遇一些曾经熟悉的和平运动和社会主义革命运动的老战士，不管什么皮色，什么国籍，什么性别我们都朝着一个伟大的目的，人类的彻底解放，和更美好更广大规模的生活前进。我对梅兰芳先生说：“你不觉得这真是一个伟大的国际主义的会吗？通过这个会我们的信心是百倍地增强了吗？”梅先生非常同意，他将把这意思向祖国广播。
