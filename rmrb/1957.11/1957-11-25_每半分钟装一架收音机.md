    One Radio Assembled Every Half Minute
    The assembly workers at the state-owned Shanghai Broadcasting Equipment Factory recently created an unprecedented record: assembling one thousand and eighteen five-tube radios in one day, averaging less than half a minute to assemble one radio.
    The Shanghai Broadcasting Equipment Factory was originally a repair department of the Shanghai People's Broadcasting Station. In 1952, it began to transform into a productive factory. In recent years, production has increased year by year. This year, it has increased eleven times compared to 1952. In the past five years, a total of 170,000 various types of radios have been produced. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    每半分钟装一架收音机
    国营上海广播器材厂的装配工人最近创造了一个空前的纪录：一天内装成一千零十八架五灯收音机，平均不到半分钟就装成一架。
    上海广播器材厂原是上海人民广播电台的一个修理部，1952年，开始转变成一个生产性的工厂。这几年来，产量逐年提高，今年比1952年提高十一倍，五年来一共生产了十七万架各种式样的收音机。　（据新华社讯）
