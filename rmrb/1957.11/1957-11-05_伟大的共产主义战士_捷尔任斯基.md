Great Communist Fighter – Dzerzhinsky
(Introducing the Soviet film "Whirlwind of Hatred")
Chen Bo

"Whirlwind of Hatred" is a deeply moving film. It truthfully recounts the heroic deeds of Dzerzhinsky, the chairman of the Cheka (All-Russian Extraordinary Commission), in his struggle against imperialists and counter-revolutionaries during the most difficult years of the young Soviet Russia in 1918. It vividly portrays the immortal image of the great communist fighter, Dzerzhinsky.

In 1918, the second year after the October Socialist Revolution, just as the Fifth Soviet Congress was being held, the imperialist group headed by British Ambassador Lockhart, colluding with domestic counter-revolutionaries, launched an attack on Soviet Russia. They assassinated the German ambassador to Moscow, attempting to provoke a new war between Germany and Soviet Russia. Simultaneously, they stirred up an armed rebellion within Soviet Russia, occupied Sanxian Lane, and shelled the Kremlin. But their fantasies did not come true. When the Fifth Soviet Congress, which was in session, received news of the riot, Cheka Chairman Dzerzhinsky immediately rushed into the enemy's den alone, exposing the enemy's conspiracy to the deceived soldiers participating in the riot and winning them over, thus quickly quelling the rebellion. The film very concisely summarized the complex political situation at home and abroad in Soviet Russia at that time, ruthlessly exposing the conspiracies of imperialist elements and the ugly faces of the Socialist-Revolutionaries who claimed to be "leftists." At the same time, through Dzerzhinsky's participation in quelling the rebellion, it prominently demonstrated Dzerzhinsky's noble qualities. When Dzerzhinsky entered the enemy's nest alone and the enemy prepared to harm him, how worried we were for his safety! But his attitude was so calm and composed, his eyes shone with the light of wisdom, and his righteous and stern speech finally touched the hearts of those deceived soldiers, causing them to turn their guns on the real enemy. From here, we can deeply understand what a noble spirit of selflessness Dzerzhinsky, this heroic proletarian fighter, possessed. For the great and magnificent revolutionary cause, for the complete victory of the proletariat, he selflessly dedicated everything he had!

The second half of the film focuses on depicting how Dzerzhinsky continued to work tirelessly for the Party and the revolutionary cause after the start of socialist construction. The many vivid and interesting stories interspersed within further demonstrate Dzerzhinsky's heroic character from various aspects. For example, after the Cheka staff arrested those homeless and wandering orphans, Dzerzhinsky believed that such a working method was too simplistic. Therefore, regardless of how tired he was, he ran to the places where those children gathered late at night, woke them up from their sleep, and explained the government's policies to them. Later, he called them to his office and invited them to eat. These actions moved the children, who had many bad habits, and they finally agreed to organize themselves and go to work in factories. Another example is that because the working class still lacked experience in managing various undertakings at that time, trains on the railway were often delayed, causing dissatisfaction among the old workers. However, Dzerzhinsky did not overly blame the old workers, but seriously listened to their opinions. Based on the clues they provided, he personally went to the station to understand the situation, found the key to the problem, and improved railway management. These seemingly ordinary things clearly show how good Dzerzhinsky was at recognizing people and how good he was at connecting with the masses. He knew that although the wandering orphans had many bad habits, they were all sons and daughters of poor workers and peasants, and their essence was good. Therefore, he trusted them and sincerely helped them. Although the old workers' criticisms were very sharp, even close to complaining, he saw in them the working class's infinite concern and enthusiasm for the socialist cause. Dzerzhinsky's good working style and detailed and in-depth working methods are always a model for us to learn from!

Dzerzhinsky's care and love for his comrades is vividly expressed in the film through his relationship with his assistant. Although Dzerzhinsky's work was so busy, he also cared about his assistant's love life and busied himself with his assistant's wedding. However, at this time, counter-revolutionaries assassinated the bride, Vera, on the road. Here, a strong and clear contrast is formed, and the shamelessness of the counter-revolutionaries and Dzerzhinsky's noble qualities are more clearly highlighted.

The film tells us that when imperialism still exists, we cannot relax our vigilance in the slightest. The film also tells us that Dzerzhinsky, who was feared by imperialists and counter-revolutionaries, was a true communist fighter. His heroic deeds and heroic image will be engraved in our hearts for a long time.

    伟大的共产主义战士——捷尔任斯基
    （介绍苏联影片“仇恨的旋风”）
    陈播
    “仇恨的旋风”是一部感人至深的影片。它真实地纪述了1918年——年轻的苏维埃俄国最困难的年代，肃反委员会（契卡）主席捷尔任斯基跟帝国主义者和反革命分子作斗争的英雄事迹，生动地塑造了伟大的共产主义战士捷尔任斯基的不朽形象。
    1918年，也就是十月社会主义革命后的第二年，正当第五次苏维埃代表大会召开的时候，以英国大使罗卡尔特为首的帝国主义集团，和国内反革命分子勾结在一起，向苏维埃俄国发动了进攻。他们刺杀了德国驻莫斯科公使，企图借此挑起德国对苏维埃俄国的新的战争，同时，又在苏维埃俄国国内掀起了武装叛乱，占据了三仙巷，并且炮击克里姆林宫。但是他们的幻想并没有实现。当正在召开的第五次苏维埃代表大会得到暴乱的消息以后，契卡主席捷尔任斯基立刻奋不顾身地只身进入虎穴，向广大参加暴乱的受欺骗的士兵揭穿了敌人的阴谋，把他们争取了过来，而使叛乱很快地平息了下去。影片非常简练地概括了当时苏维埃俄国国内外复杂的政治形势，无情地揭露了帝国主义分子的阴谋诡计和自命是“左派”的社会革命党人的丑恶面目，同时也通过捷尔任斯基参加平息叛乱这件事，突出地表现了捷尔任斯基的崇高品质。当捷尔任斯基只身进入敌人的巢穴，敌人准备伤害他的时候，我们多么为他的安全耽心啊！但他的态度却是那么从容镇静，他的眼中闪射着明智的光芒，而他的义正词严的讲话，也终于打动了那些受欺骗的士兵的心，使他们掉转枪口，朝向真正的敌人。从这里，我们可以深切地理解到，捷尔任斯基，这位英勇的无产阶级战士具有多么崇高的忘我精神，为了伟大壮丽的革命事业，为了无产阶级的彻底胜利，他不顾自己的安危，无私地献出了自己的一切！
    影片后半部着重地描写了在社会主义建设开始以后，捷尔任斯基仍然孜孜不倦地为党、为革命事业工作的情况。其中穿插的许多生动的、有趣的故事，更加多方面地展现了捷尔任斯基的英雄性格。例如契卡的工作人员逮捕了那些无家可归、流落街头的孤儿以后，捷尔任斯基认为这样的工作方法过于简单化了，于是他不顾自己多么疲乏，在深夜里跑到那些孩子们集中的地方，把他们从睡梦中叫了起来，向他们讲解政府的政策，后来又把他们叫到自己办公室里去，请他们吃饭。这些行动使得那些流氓习气很重的孩子们感动了，最后终于愿意组织起来，到工厂去劳动。又如因为当时工人阶级还缺乏管理各种事业的经验，铁路上列车经常误点，引起了老工人的不满；但是捷尔任斯基却没有过多地责备老工人，而是认真地听取了老工人的意见，根据他提供的线索，亲自到车站现场去了解情况，找出了问题的关键，改进了铁路管理工作。这些看来很平常的事情，却清楚地表明，捷尔任斯基是多么善于识别人，多么善于联系群众。他知道流浪的孤儿虽然有很多不良的习性，但他们都是穷苦的工农子弟，他们的本质是好的，因此他信任他们，诚心诚意地帮助他们；老工人的批评虽然很尖锐，甚至接近于发牢骚，但是他却从中看到了工人阶级对于社会主义事业的无限关怀和积极性。捷尔任斯基这种良好的工作作风和细致深入的工作方法，永远是我们学习的榜样！
    捷尔任斯基对于同志的关怀和爱护，影片通过他和他的助手的关系，很鲜明地表现了出来。捷尔任斯基的工作虽然那么繁忙，但他还关心他的助手的恋爱生活，并且为他助手结婚的事情张罗着。然而就在这时候，反革命分子却在路上把新娘子薇拉暗杀了。这里形成了强烈的鲜明的对比，反革命分子的无耻和捷尔任斯基的崇高品质更加清楚地突现出来了。
    影片告诉我们，当帝国主义还存在的时候，我们不能丝毫放松警惕。影片也告诉我们，为帝国主义分子和反革命分子所害怕的捷尔任斯基，是真正的共产主义的战士。他的英雄事迹和英雄形象将长久地铭刻在我们心里。
