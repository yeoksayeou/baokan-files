    A Record of Big-Character Posters at the Ministry of Coal Industry
    Zhang Yuan
    The Ministry of Coal Industry entered the third stage of the rectification movement on November 1st. On the walls of this ministry and its affiliated bureaus and institutes, in the same places where big-character posters powerfully refuting the fallacies of the Rightists were once displayed, are now densely packed new big-character posters directly targeting "three isms." One poster, a hundred posters, a thousand posters – by the time the special debate began (November 14th), a total of 14,687 big-character posters had been put up. This means that 83% of the employees in this ministry have posted big-character posters, averaging four posters per person. Engineer Liu Xiyuan of the Mining Design Institute posted a total of thirty-three big-character posters, frankly offering criticisms and suggestions on regulations, systems, planning management, and the ideological style of leading cadres and certain Party cadres. Engineer Li Zhen of the Electromechanical Section of this institute, after listening to the mobilization report for the third stage of the rectification movement, resolved to help the Party rectify and reform. Thus, he, along with comrades Chen Yi, Xue Shouchun, and Fang Shushi of the Electromechanical Group, posted twenty big-character posters, raising many beneficial criticisms and suggestions on Party-masses relations and technical management. ××× These more than 14,000 big-character posters put forward a total of 15,656 specific opinions. If we add the opinions raised in various forums, there are already more than 3,500 opinions on the system and organization. People criticized the phenomenon of bloated organizations and overstaffing. A big-character poster by Sun Zhenglong of the Cadre Education Department attracted much attention. He used seven large sheets of paper to write more than 3,000 words, discussing the issue of streamlining the organization in detail. Finally, he concluded that the current fifteen divisions and sections of the Ministry of Coal Industry could be merged into eight divisions, and personnel could be reduced by 35%. There were more than 4,800 opinions on policies and business. Comrade Hou Yeyi of the Supply Bureau criticized the violation of the policy of building the country through diligence and thrift in supply work. He wrote: "Because the leadership does not pay attention to reserve plans and material balance, they want to grab more whenever they see things are lacking. If we remove this year's usage, the current inventory of hoisting machines over two meters long is enough for three years, not counting planned purchases. Tractors, telephones, lifting equipment, etc., will also not be used up in one or two years.” Comrade Wang De'an of the Technical Division simply listed the names of four libraries and the number of staff in each library in his big-character poster, "How Many Libraries Are There." But everyone who saw this big-character poster admitted that it was indeed a problem: why do four units in the same building each need a library? ×××
    Here, there are more than 14,000 opinions about the ideological style of cadres. Of particular note is that twenty Party cadres at the section chief level or above (including four division chief-level cadres, eight section chief-level cadres, and eight section chief-level cadres) have been subjected to relatively concentrated and severe criticism from the masses due to relatively serious shortcomings in their usual ideological style or moral character. Zhang Wen, the deputy director of the Technical Safety Supervision Bureau, is a veteran cadre who joined the Party in 1927. He deteriorated politically due to arrogance and complacency. The masses posted ninety-six big-character posters to criticize him. The Ministry's Rectification Leadership Group also wrote a big-character poster on the blackboard newspaper, expressing resolute support for the masses' criticism and ordering Comrade Zhang Wen to conduct a self-criticism in the near future. Someone said after reading the Ministry's Rectification Leadership Group's big-character poster, "The leadership is really determined this time!" Now people can see that this Deputy Director Zhang, who usually dislikes listening to criticism, often stands in front of the big-character posters, opening his notebook to copy the opinions raised by others, and expressing his intention to conduct a serious self-criticism.
    Such a powerful mass criticism and the firm determination expressed by the rectification leadership have caused a reaction among some non-Party leading cadres: they expressed their willingness to "burn themselves with fire," overcome their shortcomings, and successfully pass this socialist test. Li Zongyao, a mining engineer at the Mining Design Institute, initially felt resentment when he saw big-character posters criticizing him. Now, however, he is actively holding forums in the budget section he leads, encouraging the masses to criticize him. As a result, forty-six comrades have raised a total of one hundred and thirty-seven large and small opinions against him. ××× The issues raised in the big-character posters are divided into four categories every day and sent to the rectification leadership agencies at all levels. Under the rectification leadership group, there are four specialized groups, namely the System and Organization Group, the Policy and Business Group, the Ideological Style Group, and the Office Affairs Group, which are responsible for comprehensively studying and handling the various opinions raised in the big-character posters. We saw the big-character poster of the Cadre Education Department's Rectification Leadership Group on the handling and decision of eight specific issues. The general idea is that the Cadre Department and the Education Department had a problem of nominal unity but actual disunity in the past, and now it has been decided to completely merge them; the problem of unclear accounts and long-term failure to check and deal with overseas dispatch work has now been assigned to a special person for inspection and settlement; the re-election of the Cadre Education Department's Party branch committee is scheduled to be carried out before the 15th; the mass reception room will be established immediately… Five of these eight issues have been outstanding and delayed for a long time. Under the big-character poster of the Cadre Education Department announcing that it would accept the opinions of the masses and start to improve its work, there was a big-character poster jointly signed by Song Zhengzheng and eight others, which said: "After reading the big-character poster 'Beginning to Change' from the Rectification Office of the Cadre Education Department, we feel that the department's leadership attaches importance to the opinions of the masses. We wholeheartedly support these improvements. In order to help the leadership thoroughly improve its work, we guarantee to put forward all our opinions without reservation."

    记煤炭工业部的大字报
    张远
    煤炭工业部是从11月1日转入整风运动第三阶段的。在这个部及所属各局和各院的墙壁上，在那些曾经张贴过有力地驳斥右派谬论的大字报的地方，现在密密层层地贴满了矛头直指“三个主义”的新大字报。一张，一百张，一千张，到转入专题辩论时（11月14日）为止，总共贴出了一万四千六百八十七张大字报。这就是说，在这个部里已有83％的职工贴了大字报，平均每人贴了四张。矿井设计院工程师刘锡源同志，先后共贴出了三十三张大字报，对规章体制、计划管理以及领导干部和某些党员干部的思想作风等方面提出了坦率的批评和建议。这个院的机电科的工程师李真同志在听了整风运动第三阶段的动员报告以后，决心帮助党进行整改，于是他同工电组的陈弋、薛寿椿、方述世等同志一起，先后贴出了二十张大字报，对党群关系和技术管理等方面提出了不少有益的批评和建议。×××这一万四千多张大字报，总共提出了一万五千六百五十六条具体意见。如果加上在各种座谈会上提出的意见，这里已经有三千五百多条关于体制机构方面的意见。人们对于机构臃肿和人浮于事的现象提出了批评。干部教育司孙政隆同志的一张大字报很引人注目。他用了七张大报纸写了三千多字，详细地谈论了精简机构的问题，最后他认为煤炭工业部现在的十五个司处可以合并成八个司，人员可以减少35％。有四千八百多条对方针业务方面的意见。供应局侯业义同志批评供应工作中违背了勤俭建国的方针。他写道：“因为领导不注意储备计划和物资平衡，看到东西少了就想多抓些。现在库存二米以上的绞车如果除去今年用的以外，不算计划中的进货，还够用三年。拖拉机、电话、起重设备等，也都是一二年用不完。”技术司汪德安同志在“图书馆何其多”这张大字报里，只是简单地开列了四个图书馆的名字和每个图书馆的工作人数。但是看到这张大字报的人都承认这确是个问题：同一个大楼，为什么四个单位要各弄一个图书馆呢？×××
    这里有一万四千多条意见是关于干部思想作风的。其中引人注意的是，有二十个科长级以上的党员干部（包括四个司长级干部，八个处长级干部和八个科长级干部），因为他们平时的思想作风或道德品质方面存在着比较严重的缺点，现在就比较集中地受到了广大群众的严厉批评。技术安全监察局的副局长张文同志，是1927年入党的老干部，他由骄傲自满而到政治上的衰退。群众贴了九十六张大字报来批评他。部整风领导小组对这件事也在黑板报上写了大字报，表示坚决支持群众的批评，并限令张文同志在最近检讨。有人在看了部整风领导小组的大字报以后说，“领导这一次是真下决心啦！”现在人们可以看到这位平时很不爱听批评的张副局长常常在大字报前，打开小本子，抄录别人对他提出的意见，并表示要认真检讨了。
    这样声势浩大的群众批评和整风领导所表示的坚定的决心，在一些非党的领导干部中引起一种反应：他们表示要“引火烧身”，克服自己的缺点，过好社会主义这一关。矿井设计院的采矿工程师李宗尧同志，起初看见有人贴大字报批评他，他表示有反感。现在他却在自己所领导的预算科主动地召开座谈会，鼓励群众对他提出批评。果然已有四十六个同志对他提出了大小一百三十七条意见。×××大字报上所提出的这些问题，每天被分成四大类，分别送到各级整风领导机构。在整风领导小组下面各有四个专门的小组，即体制机构组、方针业务组、思想作风组和机关事务组，分别负责综合、研究和处理大字报所提出的各项意见。我们看到了干部教育司整风领导小组对八个具体问题所作处理和决定的大字报。大意是说，干部司和教育司过去是明合暗不合的问题，现在决定彻底合并；国外派遣工作中账目不清长期不检查处理的问题，现在已指定专人进行检查结算；改选干教司党支部委员的问题，准备在15日以前进行；群众接待室问题马上建立……。这八个问题中有五个问题是长期存在拖延着没有解决的。在干部教育司这张宣布接受群众意见着手改进工作的大字报下边，有一张宋正海等九人联名的大字报，上面说：“我们看了干教司整风办公室‘开始改了’的大字报以后，感到司的领导对群众的意见是重视的。我们衷心地拥护这些改进。为了帮助领导上彻底改进工作，我们保证把自己的意见毫无保留地全部提出来。”
