    Dulles Cannot Deny Soviet Achievements
    Forced to Admit Soviet Union Surpassed US in Missiles
    Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 6th - US Secretary of State Dulles admitted at a press conference on November 5th, when speaking about the Soviet Union's launch of the second artificial satellite, that this fact demonstrates that the Soviet Union does indeed possess many methods to enter outer space, and it seems that the Soviet Union has moved ahead of the United States in missiles.
    Dulles acknowledged that the Soviet Union's successful launch of two artificial satellites is an important manifestation of the rapid progress of science and technology in the forty years since the founding of the Soviet Union. However, he tried to cover up the universally acknowledged fact since the launch of the satellites that the Soviet Union has greatly surpassed the United States in science and technology, saying that this development only "greatly shortened the distance between the United States and the Soviet Union." He said that a few years ago, the United States had the atomic bomb, but the Soviet Union did not. But eventually, the Soviet Union also had it. Later, the United States had the hydrogen bomb, and the Soviet Union did not. But the Soviet Union has it today. The Soviet Union is now very advanced in missiles, and it seems to him that in some respects, the Soviet Union is a bit ahead of the United States. Dulles helplessly said, "It is impossible to maintain the same distance as ten years ago."
    Dulles also insisted that the Soviet Union's successful launch of artificial satellites was only due to the Soviet government's "concentrating its efforts on the military aspects of technology." However, the reporter's questioning immediately put Dulles in an embarrassing situation. A reporter pointed out that the US President's Committee of Scientists and Engineers had released a statement to the press pointing out that since its founding, the Soviet government has "concentrated its efforts on a very broad range of aspects, making it seem as if it encompasses everything that mankind can achieve, and has also achieved great achievements in these issues, such as those obtained in missiles." The reporter pointed out that this statement was clearly inconsistent with Dulles's aforementioned statement. At this time, Dulles had to admit that his statement was "too narrow" and that the Soviet government was not only concentrating its efforts on the military aspects.
    When asked if the US missile program was lagging far behind the Soviet Union, the talkative Secretary of State said that this was not within his purview. But he added that due to the launch of the Soviet artificial satellite, the US government will re-examine and review the US missile and rocket program.

### 杜勒斯也无法抹煞苏联成就  不得不承认苏联在导弹方面超过美国

    杜勒斯也无法抹煞苏联成就
    不得不承认苏联在导弹方面超过美国
    据新华社6日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务卿杜勒斯11月5日在记者招待会上谈到苏联发射第二颗人造卫星时承认，这个事实说明，苏联的确拥有可以进入外空的许多办法，看来苏联在导弹方面已经走在美国的前面。
    杜勒斯承认苏联成功地发射两颗人造卫星是苏联建国四十年以来科学技术突飞猛进的一个重要表现，但是，他又力图掩饰自卫星发射以来举世公认的苏联在科学和技术方面已经大大超越美国的事实，而说这种发展只是“大大缩短了美苏两国的距离”。他说，在数年以前，美国拥有原子弹而苏联还没有。但是最后苏联也有了，后来美国有了氢弹，而苏联没有。但是苏联今天也有了。苏联现在在导弹方面很先进，而在他看起来，好像在某些方面苏联有些跑在美国的前头。杜勒斯无可奈何地说，“要想保持十年前的那样大的距离是不可能的”了。
    杜勒斯还硬说苏联发射人造卫星成功只是由于苏联政府“集中力量于技术的军事方面”。但是，记者的追问马上使杜勒斯陷入了狼狈境地。有记者指出，美国总统的科学家和工程师委员会曾经向报界发表谈话指出苏联政府在建国以来“把力量集中在非常广泛的许多方面，使得人看起来好像包括人类所能做到的一切，并且在这些问题上也取得了像在导弹方面所得到的伟大成就”。记者指出，这一谈话同杜勒斯的上述说法显然是矛盾的。这时候杜勒斯不得不承认，他的说法“太狭窄了”，苏联政府并不是只把力量集中于军事方面。
    在问到美国的导弹计划是否比苏联落后得很厉害时，这个爱多嘴的国务卿却说这不是他的职权范围。但又说由于苏联人造卫星的发射，美国政府将要重新研究和审查美国的导弹和火箭计划。
