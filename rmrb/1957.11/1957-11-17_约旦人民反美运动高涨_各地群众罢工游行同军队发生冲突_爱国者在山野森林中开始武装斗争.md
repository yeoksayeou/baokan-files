Xinhua News Agency, 16th dispatch from Beirut: According to a report in the Lebanese "Al-Sharq" newspaper on the 15th, on November 14th, the birthday of Jordanian King Hussein, strikes were held throughout Jordan, and demonstrations took place in many cities, protesting the government's pro-American foreign policy. The marching masses clashed with the armed forces, resulting in injuries.

The newspaper also stated that Jordanian patriots have gathered in the mountains and forests and have begun an armed struggle to liberate their motherland from imperialist oppression.

According to a report in the Cairo "Al-Misaa" newspaper on the 15th, a "People's Struggle Committee" in Jordan has distributed leaflets throughout Jordan condemning Hussein.

Cairo newspapers also said on the 14th that the Jordanian people are increasingly dissatisfied with King Hussein and his government's alignment with the United States, and that "the domestic situation in Jordan is developing towards open revolution."

Xinhua News Agency, 16th dispatch from Paris: The Paris "Le Monde" recently published a dispatch from Amman saying that the United States has filled the "vacuum" left by Britain in Jordan. The United States is now the sole financier of this nearly bankrupt small country.

This dispatch, published by the newspaper on November 7th, stated that King Hussein supports the Hashemite government, which is actually led by the cunning Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Rifai. For the United States, Rifai is the savior. Richard Sanger, the Oriental Counselor and expert on Arab affairs at the U.S. Embassy, has the responsibility of clearly teaching this point to the Jordanian royal family.

The dispatch stated that currently in Jordan, anyone who is unwilling to praise the current regime and the United States is not only an agitator, but also a dangerous agitator – subject to military law, a possible prisoner.

The dispatch also described the situation under the current Jordanian government's reign of terror, saying that all roads, large and small, throughout the country are closed from 6:00 p.m. to 5:00 a.m. every day. During the day, even in the capital Amman, going to the post office has become a dangerous matter. To go from Amman to Jerusalem, one must first obtain a pass, and then be subjected to a detailed search along the way.

    约旦人民反美运动高涨
    各地群众罢工游行同军队发生冲突
    爱国者在山野森林中开始武装斗争
    新华社16日讯  贝鲁特消息：据黎巴嫩“东方报”15日报道，在11月14日约旦国王侯赛因过生日那一天，约旦全国各地举行了罢工，许多城市举行了示威游行，抗议政府奉行投靠美国的外交政策。游行的群众和武装部队发生了冲突，结果有人受了伤。
    这家报纸还说，约旦爱国者集结在山野和森林中，为了把自己的祖国从帝国主义的压迫下解放出来开始了武装斗争。
    据开罗“晚报”15日报道，约旦有一个“人民斗争委员会”已经在约旦全国各地散发了谴责侯赛因的传单。
    开罗报纸14日也说，约旦人民对侯赛因国王和他的政府倒向美国愈来愈不满意，“约旦国内形势正在向公开的革命发展”。
    据新华社16日讯  巴黎消息：巴黎“世界报”最近发表的一篇安曼通讯说，美国已经填补了英国在约旦所遗留下来的“真空”。现在美国是这个接近破产的小国的唯一财主。
    这家报纸在11月7日发表的这篇通讯说，侯赛因国王支持实际上由狡诈的副首相兼外交大臣里法伊领导的哈希姆政府。对美国说来，里法伊才是救星。美国大使馆东方参赞、阿拉伯事务专家理查德·桑纳的职责，就是把这一点明确教导给约旦王室。
    通讯说，目前在约旦，凡是不愿意颂扬现政权和美国的人，不仅是煽动分子，而且是危险的煽动分子——军法从事的对象，可能的囚徒。
    通讯还描写目前约旦政府恐怖统治下的情况说，每天从傍晚六时到次早五时，全国大小道路一概禁止通行。白天，甚至在首都安曼，上邮政局都成了危险的事情。从安曼到耶路撒冷去，首先得取得通行证，然后一路上要受到详尽搜查。
