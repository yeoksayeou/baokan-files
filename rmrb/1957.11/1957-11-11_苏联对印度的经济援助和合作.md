    Soviet Economic Aid and Cooperation to India
    Xin Yin
    "Do you want to build factories? We are very happy about this. Perhaps you lack experience? Then, come to us, and we will help you. Do you want to build power stations? If you have no experience in this area, if you need technical assistance, then, come to us, and we will help you. Do you want to send your students and engineers to study with us? Please send them." (Khrushchev: Speech in India on November 22, 1955)

    In the less than two years since then, Soviet aid and economic cooperation for India's development plans have greatly expanded. The most vivid expression of this cooperation and friendship is the massive "steel city" gradually emerging in Bhilai. Formerly an obscure place, Bhilai is today filled with activity and non-stop work day and night across miles of land. The giant steel plant with a capacity of one million tons of steel per year will be completed by the end of 1959, and its three coking ovens, two blast furnaces, and one iron-smelting plant will begin production before December 31, 1958. Daily, large quantities of steel structures and equipment orders pour into Bhilai from various factories in the Soviet Union and India. Several Soviet factories are racing against time to supply the most modern machinery to the Bhilai steel plant. Recently, the Neva Machine Building Plant in Leningrad announced that it had manufactured a 12,000 kW turbine for Bhilai. At the steel plant site, thousands of Indian workers and engineers are working side by side with Soviet engineers, laying the foundation for auxiliary departments and building the city. Joint efforts have overcome and resolved the problems and difficulties that arise daily. To build this factory, the Soviet government has advanced a loan of 630 million rupees. As the factory is being built, a huge city is also growing, and soon, when the first blast furnace of the steel plant is put into production, a whole line of affiliated factories will also appear.

    India attaches particular importance to the development of important basic industries such as steel, coal, petroleum, and shipping. And it is precisely in these basic industrial sectors that Soviet cooperation and assistance are making the greatest contributions.

    Of all countries, the Soviet Union has provided the largest amount of assistance for the development of India's basic heavy industries. This assistance has already exceeded 1.8 billion rupees. Recently, the Soviet Union and India signed another loan agreement, with the Soviet Union providing India with a loan of 500 million rubles to help India build a number of heavy industrial enterprises. A group of Soviet experts are now finalizing proposals for the establishment of a heavy machinery manufacturing plant, which will produce equipment for metallurgical plants and hydropower stations, as well as mining equipment for non-ferrous metal plants and steel plants. Soviet experts are already helping India with geological surveys to explore for oil, and Soviet machinery and equipment are being used in various locations in Punjab and Rajasthan to conduct actual drilling and develop new oil-bearing structures. Soviet experts have also helped survey India's Panna diamond mines. According to a recently concluded agreement, Soviet equipment for coal cutting and for modernizing India's coal industry will be shipped to India.

    In addition to heavy industry, India's leaders and national planning officials also value cooperative farming to increase agricultural production. Soviet collective farming equipment worth more than 10 million rupees, gifted to India, has been used to establish India's first and largest state-owned farm in Rajasthan.

    The diverse trade between India and the Soviet Union since 1950-1951 is one of the prominent features of this mutually beneficial cooperation. In 1956, the amount of this trade was four times that of 1955. Looking at the items of various products sold by the Soviet Union to India by the end of 1956, one can see how significant and concrete the Soviet Union's contribution to India's prosperity is. The Soviet product list includes oil drilling equipment, duplicating machines, metal lathes, tractors, 300,000 tons of rolled steel, 150,000 tons of concrete, turbines, ball bearings, aluminum, and other goods. According to mutual understanding, the proceeds from the Soviet Union's sale of goods to India are used to purchase Indian goods and to maintain the Soviet Union's official representation in India. In 1956, the Soviet Union purchased 7,000 tons of tea, 20 million meters of linen, a large number of gunny sacks and pepper from India. The Soviet Union also purchased coffee, shellac, wool, raw hides, myrobalan, leather shoes, and handicrafts. A prominent feature of this trade is that it is balanced, and India's import of Soviet machinery does not deplete India's foreign exchange reserves. This again illustrates that friendly trade between the two countries contributes to India's industrialization and prosperity.

    Soviet aid and cooperation are also diverse. In terms of agricultural equipment, it takes the form of assistance and gifts. In the case of the Bhilai steel plant and new long-term credit proposals, it takes the form of low-interest, long-term loans. The interest rate on the Bhilai loan is only 2.5%, while the interest rates charged by British and German companies on loans to India are 5%-6%.

    In a speech during his visit to India, Khrushchev told Western countries to "compete with us in establishing friendship with India." This competition not only helped India to get Western countries to conclude long-delayed agreements on construction projects, but also helped India to obtain more favorable terms, which it could not have obtained before the Soviet Union extended a hand of friendship to it. A very prominent example is steel plants. British and German companies had been delaying negotiations and demanding very high interest rates. Later, because the Soviet government quickly and successfully concluded the negotiations for the Bhilai steel plant and only required a very low interest rate, the Indian government was able to quickly conclude the agreements for the remaining two steel plants with Western companies.

    This fact may also be worth noting: India's shipping industry is still mainly controlled by foreign companies. These companies often threaten to raise freight prices, creating difficulties for the Indian government. The India-Soviet agreement and the subsequent India-Poland agreement to establish Indian shipping companies are a major challenge to foreign monopoly capital. Therefore, these agreements are welcomed by Indian patriots as milestones in the development of India's independent shipping industry.

    苏联对印度的经济援助和合作
    新印
    “你们想建设工厂吗？我们对这点感到很高兴。或许你们经验不足吧？那么，找我们，我们帮助你们。你们想建设电力站吗？要是你们在这方面没有经验，要是你们需要技术上的帮助，那么，找我们，我们帮助你们。你们想派遣自己的学生和工程师到我们那里学习吗？请派来罢。”（赫鲁晓夫：1955年11月22日在印度发表的演说）
    在这以后不到二年的期间里，苏联对印度的开发计划的援助和经济合作已经大大发展了。这种合作和友谊最鲜明的表现就是在比莱逐渐出现的庞大的“钢城”。以前默默无闻的比莱，今天在长达数英里的土地上充满了活动和昼夜不息的工作。有着年产一百万吨钢的能力的巨大炼钢厂将在1959年年底以前建成，而它的三座炼焦炉、两座鼓风炉和一座炼铁厂将在1958年12月31日以前开始投入生产。每天有大量钢材结构和设备定货从苏联和印度各个工厂涌向比莱。几家苏联工厂正在和时间赛跑，以求把最新式的机器供给比莱炼钢厂。最近列宁格勒的涅瓦机器制造厂宣布，已为比莱制成了一万二千瓩的涡轮机。在炼钢厂的厂址上，成千上万的印度工人和工程师同苏联工程师并肩工作，为辅助部门奠定基础，并建筑城市。共同的努力克服了并且解决了每天出现的一些问题和困难。为了建立这座工厂，苏联政府已经垫付了六亿三千万卢比的贷款。在建立这座工厂的同时，一座巨大的城市也在成长着，不久，当这座炼钢厂的第一座鼓风炉投入生产时，一整列附属工厂也将出现。
    印度特别重视钢铁、煤、石油和船运等重要的基本工业的发展。而正是在这些基本工业部门中，苏联的合作和援助给予最大的贡献。
    在所有国家之中，苏联对于发展印度的基本重工业方面给予了最大量的援助。这种援助已经超过了十八亿卢比。最近苏联又和印度签订了一项贷款协定，苏联给予印度五亿卢布的贷款，帮助印度建造一批重工业的企业。一批苏联专家现在正在最后确定建立重型机器制造厂的建议，这个工厂将生产供冶金工厂和水电站使用的设备，以及供有色金属工厂和钢铁厂使用的采矿设备。苏联专家已经在帮助印度从事地质调查来探测石油，而在旁遮普和拉贾斯坦的各个地方正在使用着苏联的机器和设备进行实际钻探和开发新的储油构造。苏联专家也曾帮助勘查了潘拿的印度钻石矿。根据最近缔结的一项协定，用来割煤以及使印度煤炭工业现代化的苏联设备将运到印度来。
    除了重工业，印度的领导人和国家计划负责人也重视合作耕作以增加农业生产。苏联送给印度的价值一千万卢比以上的集体耕作设备，已经被用来在拉贾斯坦邦建立了印度第一个最大的国营农场。
    自从1950—1951年以来的印苏多种多样的贸易，是这种互助合作的显著特点之一。在1956年，这种贸易的数额是1955年的四倍。看一下到1956年年底苏联卖给印度的各种产品的项目，就知道苏联对印度繁荣的贡献是多么重大和具体。苏联货单中包括采油钻孔设备、复写机、金属旋床、拖拉机、三十万吨辗钢、十五万吨的混凝土、涡轮机、滚珠轴承、铝以及其他货物。苏联卖给印度货物所得的价款，根据相互的了解，都用于购买印度的货物和作为维持苏联在印度的官方代表的费用。在1956年，苏联购买了印度七千吨茶叶、两千万公尺麻织品、大量麻袋和胡椒。苏联还购买了咖啡、虫漆、羊毛、生皮、漆树果、皮鞋和手工艺品。这个交易的一个显著特点是，它是平衡的，印度输入苏联的机器并不消耗印度的外汇。这里又一次说明两国之间的友好贸易是有助于印度的工业化和繁荣的。
    苏联的援助和合作也是多种多样的。在农业装备方面，其形式是帮助和赠送。就比莱炼钢厂和新的长期信贷建议而言，其形式则是低利长期贷款。比莱贷款的利率仅为2．5％，而英国和德国的公司借给印度的贷款的利率则为5％—6％。
    赫鲁晓夫在其访问印度时发表的一篇演说中曾经向西方国家说，要它们“在同印度建立友谊方面同我们竞赛”。这种竞赛不仅帮助印度使得西方国家同它缔结拖延再三的建设工程的协议，并且还帮助印度得到比较有利的条件，而这在苏联向它伸出友谊之手以前是得不到的。举一个极显著的例子。在炼钢厂方面，英国和德国公司过去一直都在拖延谈判，并且要求很高的利率。后来由于苏联政府一下子就圆满结束了比莱炼钢厂的谈判，并且只要很低的利率，遂使印度政府同西方国家的公司谈判的其余两个炼钢厂的协议也很快地缔结成功了。
    这个事实可能也是值得注意的：印度的航运业主要还操在外国公司的手里。这些公司经常扬言要提高货运价格而给印度政府制造困难。建立印度航运公司的印苏协议以及继之而来的印波协议，对于外国垄断资本是个极大的挑战，因此这些协议受到印度爱国人士的欢迎，认为是印度独立航运业发展途上的丰碑。
