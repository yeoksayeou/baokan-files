Achieving Agricultural Development Program's Highest Target Ten Years Ahead of Schedule
Cotton Yield Per Mu Exceeds 100 Jin in Four Counties and Cities

Xinhua News Agency, 8th - A reporter learned from the National Cotton Production Conference, which began on the 6th, that this year, four counties (cities) across the country have already achieved an average cotton yield of over 100 jin (raw cotton) per mu, exceeding the highest target for average annual cotton yield per mu stipulated in the revised draft of the National Agricultural Development Program.

These four counties (cities) are: Cixi in Zhejiang, Macheng in Hubei, Dunhuang in Gansu, and Shijiazhuang City in Hebei. Cixi County, a cotton-producing area in the southeast coastal region, planted 488,000 mu of cotton this year, with an average yield of 105 jin of raw cotton per mu. Macheng County, located in the hilly and mountainous cotton-wheat double-cropping area of the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, planted 130,000 mu of cotton fields this year. Before planting cotton, they harvested a crop of wheat. In addition to an average wheat yield of over 200 jin per mu, an increase of nearly half compared to last year, they also harvested an average of 103 jin of raw cotton per mu. The county also had 3,000 mu of cotton fields with a harvest of over 1,000 jin of cotton and wheat per mu. Although Dunhuang County is a new cotton-producing area, its average cotton yield per mu reached 100 jin in 1955. This year, its 78,000 mu of cotton fields yielded an average of 105 jin of raw cotton per mu. Shijiazhuang City, located in the irrigated area of the Yellow River's lower reaches plain, planted 76,000 mu of cotton this year, with an average yield of 101 jin of raw cotton per mu.

The most fundamental reason for these counties (cities) achieving such good harvests is that, with strong support from the state and on the basis of agricultural cooperation, they identified the key to increasing cotton production in their respective localities and actively promoted various yield-increasing measures suitable for their areas. Macheng County, under the leadership of the County Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, identified and solved the two key problems in increasing cotton production in the county—overcoming the contradictions in the cotton and wheat, cotton and rice production processes, and implementing various effective yield-increasing technical measures—thereby achieving a large-scale bumper harvest of grain and cotton.

    提前十年达到农业发展纲要的最高指标
    四个县市棉花亩产超过百斤
    新华社8日讯　记者从6日开始举行的全国棉产工作会议上获悉：今年全国已有四个县（市）的棉花产量平均每亩达到一百斤（皮棉）以上，超过全国农业发展纲要修正草案所规定的棉花每亩平均年产量的最高指标。
    这四个县（市）是：浙江慈溪，湖北麻城，甘肃敦煌，河北石家庄市。东南沿海的产棉区慈溪县，今年播种四十八万八千亩棉花，平均每亩收获皮棉一百零五斤。处在长江中游丘陵山地的棉麦两熟区麻城县，今年播种的十三万亩棉田，在播种棉花前收了一届小麦，这些棉田除了平均每亩产小麦二百斤以上、比去年增产将近一半以外，平均每亩还收获皮棉一百零三斤，全县并有三千亩棉田每亩收获棉麦上千斤。敦煌县虽然是新棉区，但是每亩平均产棉量在1955年就达到了一百斤，今年的七万八千亩棉田，平均每亩收获了一百零五斤皮棉。地处黄河下游平原灌溉区的石家庄市，今年播种七万六千亩棉花，平均每亩产皮棉一百零一斤。
    这些县（市）的棉田能够得到这样良好的收成，最根本的一个原因是，在国家大力支援和农业合作化的基础上，找出了本地的棉花增产关键，积极推行了各项适宜本地的增产措施。麻城县就是在中共县委领导下，找出并解决了这个县棉花增产上的两个关键问题——克服棉和麦、棉和稻生产过程中的矛盾，贯彻执行各项有效的增产技术措施，而获得了粮棉的大面积丰收。
